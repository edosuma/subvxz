Previous/)4”

00:03.170 --> 00:04.910
We've chosen a name. Baby Klara.

00:06.170 --> 00:09.162
They are dead.
They got the measle, and...

00:09.260 --> 00:11.546
Measles travelled with you
from Cross Creek.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.001
It spreads from person to person.

00:14.550 --> 00:16.006
- Murtagh.
- Ah!

00:16.100 --> 00:17.089
I have my forge here.

00:17.390 --> 00:19.460
Will you return to Fraser's Ridge
with us?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.176
We'll work together.

00:21.270 --> 00:24.228
I am Major John William Grey,
the governor of this prison.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.068
I couldn't give you freedom.
This is the next best I could manage.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.106
It’s ca/lea' He/water.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.397
Well, my wedding is in three days.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.527
I want my first time
to be with someone like you.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.609
My sister's dead.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.531
Ellesmere knew the ch/70' wasn ’1‘ his.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.609
We named him l/l/I7/l'am.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.498
Would you look out
for Willie as his father?

00:47.460 --> 00:49.917
Sing me a song

00:50.000 --> 00:52.969
Of a /ass that is gone

00:53.130 --> 00:55.132
5a» could that lass

00:56.010 --> 00:57.750
Be 1'?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.716
Merry of soul

01:00.810 --> 01:03.517
She sa/leo’ on a day

01:03.940 --> 01:06.147
Over the sea

01:06.230 --> 01:08.266
7'0 Skye

01:09.190 --> 01:11.647
[Wow and breeze

01:11.740 --> 01:14.140
Islands and seas

01:14.240 --> 01:18.904
Mountains of rain and sun

01:19.530 --> 01:21.998
All that was good

01:22.080 --> 01:24.321
All that was fair

01:24.790 --> 01:26.917
All that was me

01:27.210 --> 01:29.952
Is gone

01:30.040 --> 01:32.167
Sing me a song

01:32.260 --> 01:35.002
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.220 --> 01:37.256
Say, could that lass

01:37.340 --> 01:40.343
Be 1'?

01:40.430 --> 01:42.557
Merry of soul

01:42.850 --> 01:45.432
She sa/led on a day

Over the sea

01:49.610 --> 01:54.604
7'0 Skye

02:48.080 --> 02:49.069
Jamie.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.036
What the devil?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.000
Well, what are you doing
in the backcountry?

02:59.180 --> 03:01.421
Well, your letter painted
such a beautiful picture of your land,

03:01.510 --> 03:03.421
I was_determined
to see It With my own eyes.

03:04.390 --> 03:06.096
And I have business in Virginia.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.858
Virginia's some way north, John.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.430
True.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.312
Which is why I sent the men
who accompanied us ahead

03:16.400 --> 03:19.392
to Woolam's Creek to make preparations
for the onward journey.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.940
He's here with me.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.496
He's waiting by the stream.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.667
I thought I might have a word
with you alone first

03:30.750 --> 03:32.911
before retrieving him, if possible.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.539
Come on.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.216
- Oh.
- Here.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.549
Christ.

03:51.100 --> 03:55.355
Pride goeth before a fall.
And a broken back.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.067
Be thankful for the help
while you have it.

03:57.150 --> 04:00.028
Perhaps you should stay.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.606
You've barely had time
to complain at all.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.407
And Jamie's quite fond of you,
I suppose.

04:05.490 --> 04:09.244
Well, it's a blessing
to see ye as well, Claire.

04:11.790 --> 04:15.453
Having you here has really made
Fraser's Ridge feel like home.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.200
Are you sure you can't stay?

04:20.840 --> 04:22.376
I have the forge to run.

04:22.970 --> 04:27.509
If I'm to stay in North Carolina at all,
I'll need to pay my taxes.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.671
And ye ken what that means.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.050
I do, unfortunately.

04:34.270 --> 04:37.398
As we speak, two of our best men

04:37.480 --> 04:40.313
are presenting the Governor
with our petition for fewer taxes.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.641
- Your Regulator friends?
-Hmm.

04:43.820 --> 04:44.809
Help!

04:45.320 --> 04:47.368
Get them off me!

04:50.950 --> 04:52.611
What is it, lad?

04:54.120 --> 04:56.998
Oh, they're just leeches.
They won't hurt you.

04:57.340 --> 05:01.003
Please, can you remove them at once?

05:02.090 --> 05:03.796
They're vile creatures.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.632
Oh, they're not so terribly vile.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.210
They have their uses.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.426
And if you can stand it,

05:08.510 --> 05:11.138
_ it's better to wait
until they drop off by themselves.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.849
I hate them, and I'd rather not wait.
If you please.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.265
Very well, then.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.316
Murtagh, can you pass me a bucket?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.276
Don't want to waste them.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.106
They're very effective

05:25.610 --> 05:27.987
in reducing the swelling of bruises.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.150
I want my father.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.576
Where is he?

05:33.410 --> 05:35.207
I don't know if he'll remember you.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.007
He was barely six when I left Helwater.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.505
A lifetime ago.

05:55.810 --> 05:58.597
Best he doesn't remember.
For his own sake.

05:58.690 --> 05:59.679
Indeed.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.642
By the by,
he insists we call him William now.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.737
We would be honoured
if you were to stay awhile.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.821
As guests.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.650
That would be delightful.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.458
Is, uh, Isobel with you?

06:21.840 --> 06:22.875
No.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.461
Isobel has died.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.836
On the ship between England and Jamaica.

06:31.050 --> 06:35.339
She and William were coming
to join me there, and she took ill.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.635
John,I".

06:40.100 --> 06:41.431
I'm sorry to hear it.

06:42.150 --> 06:43.390
How are you bearing up?

06:44.150 --> 06:45.390
As you'd expect.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.730
It has been a trial.

06:51.370 --> 06:55.409
For William, especially.
He's grief-stricken.

06:57.540 --> 06:58.700
But I

07:00.920 --> 07:02.660
must keep my chin up for him.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.956
She was such a kind soul.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.806
And a wonderful mother to Willie.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.346
William.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.550
- Yes, she was.
- Hang on.

07:23.150 --> 07:24.765
We'll see what we can do.

07:27.570 --> 07:28.605
Lord John.

07:28.950 --> 07:30.269
Mistress Fraser.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.866
'Tis a pleasure to see you again.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.615
You know my father?

07:36.700 --> 07:38.076
I do.

07:39.370 --> 07:40.826
The pleasure is mine.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.200
A reunion indeed.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.205
Mr Fitzgibbons.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.256
Well, you appear well
after all this time.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.001
'Tis the mountain air, I expect.

07:55.050 --> 07:58.053
I see you've made the acquaintance
of our gracious hostess.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.267
Will you not also pay your compliments
to our host?

08:03.230 --> 08:05.391
I don't believe _
I've been gIven your name, srr.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.357
How impertinent of me.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.027
May I present Mr James Fraser.

08:13.610 --> 08:17.398
Mr Fraser, it is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.071
Yours as well, Master William.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.957
The young master
encountered some leeches

08:29.880 --> 08:31.290
down at the stream.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.253
With your permission, I'd like
to take him out to clean the wounds.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.500
Yes, of course.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.210
Come along.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.183
William is unaware of the circumstances
of how we three met.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.569
I'd be grateful
for your discretion in the matter.

08:48.900 --> 08:49.969
Aye.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.443
Wouldn't want him to think
you keep dishonourable company.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.736
The past is the past.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.271
Lord John is a trusted friend.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.156
His kindness helped
to preserve your life.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.949
Aye.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.069
That it did.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.332
I'll say nothing of Ardsmuir to the lad.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.910
Thank you, Mr Fitzgibbons.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.342
Did you sail into Wilmington?

09:18.430 --> 09:19.419
New Bern, sir.

09:19.510 --> 09:22.764
Governor Tryon was kind enough
to offer us respite at his new palace.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.055
Ye ken the Governor, then?

09:24.140 --> 09:27.268
Yes, we met some years ago in London.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.509
We're both members

09:29.610 --> 09:31.851
of the Society for the Appreciation
of the English Beefsteak.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.198
It's a gentleman's club in London.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.192
Ian would love to hear of such a club.

09:37.990 --> 09:39.196
- Your nephew?
- Aye.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.534
He's out hunting with some
of our Cherokee neighbours as we speak.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.361
He lives with you here, then?
I'm very sorry to find him absent.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.325
The young man for whom
you crossed an ocean.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.409
Aye.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.049
The Governor's built himself
a palace, then?

09:52.880 --> 09:56.043
Yes, when it is complete,
it will stand as a symbol

09:56.130 --> 09:58.041
to stability in the Province.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.380
A true monument to elegance.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.709
Hmm.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.466
Elegance?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.220
Where's the money coming from?

10:07.900 --> 10:12.143
A rather untimely investment, perhaps.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.398
Well, given the debts of the Province
clue to the recent war.

10:16.530 --> 10:19.317
I believe the Governor has asked
the Assembly to allocate funds.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.947
Though it appears some here
in the backcountry

10:22.030 --> 10:24.407
are rallying against the taxes
levied to build it.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.536
Because the taxes are EXCESSlVE.

10:26.620 --> 10:27.996
And rising.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.413
No doubt they feel
a palace or a monument

10:31.500 --> 10:33.582
is not the best use
of their hard-earned coin.

10:33.670 --> 10:34.659
They?

10:35.170 --> 10:36.501
By "they" I suppose you mean the mob,

10:36.590 --> 10:38.751
for that is what
they inevitably turn out to be.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.255
Take these "Regulators" for instance.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.137
By all accounts,
they're unreasonable and dangerous.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.553
A menace to the backcountry and given
to causing disruption by means of riot.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.727
Have you encountered
anything of the kind here?

10:55.860 --> 10:59.239
There is the backcountry, John,
and there is the wilderness.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.074
Not likely to have that sort of trouble
here at Fraser's Ridge.

11:03.660 --> 11:07.619
By all accounts,
it's the Governor himself

11:07.710 --> 11:11.919
who's unreasonable and dangerous.

11:16.340 --> 11:18.717
Those Regulators tied a sheriff
to his horse

11:18.800 --> 11:21.542
and marched with his beaten body
through the streets of Hillsborough.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.051
There were women and children present.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.550
Would you call that reasonable?

11:25.890 --> 11:27.721
Exaggeration and falsehood.

11:27.810 --> 11:29.300
I'm told there were many witnesses.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.220
Have you not fared well
in the New World?

11:37.940 --> 11:39.020
Oh, aye.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.902
I have more than rats to eat now,
My Lord.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.736
You've eaten rats, sir?

11:44.830 --> 11:48.743
Mr Fitzgibbons has
a very peculiar sense of humour.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.109
Aye.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.279
Aye.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.200
Thank ye for dinner.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.046
A pleasant evening indeed.

12:00.130 --> 12:01.119
Mmm.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.266
Can I interest you in a game of chess?

12:16.480 --> 12:18.357
I'm afraid I dinna have a chess set.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.351
Fortunately for you,
I brought mine.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.067
I'd never travel without it.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.401
May I be excused?

12:25.570 --> 12:29.609
Well, there's a privy
just behind the cabin, Master William.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.110
Outside?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.325
Won't someone fetch a chamber pot?

12:34.540 --> 12:36.496
You must become accustomed
to usmg the privy

12:36.590 --> 12:38.160
while we're guests here
at Fraser's Ridge.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.580
Yes, Papa.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.427
I'll show ye where it is.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.509
Mac?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.566
Is your name not MacKenzie?

13:02.190 --> 13:03.350
Aye.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.156
MacKenzie's one of my given names.

13:07.450 --> 13:09.987
And you are the groom at this estate?

13:12.120 --> 13:13.109
No.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.076
No, Fraser's Ridge is my land.

13:17.500 --> 13:21.049
But I tend to the horses,
along with everything else.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.921
Do you remember me?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.591
Fondly.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.438
Then why did you not remind me
of our acquaintanceship

13:34.520 --> 13:35.680
when we were introduced?

13:44.650 --> 13:45.696
I dinna ken.

13:49.160 --> 13:53.529
Do you still have the wooden snake
I carved for ye?

13:55.290 --> 13:57.531
I'm too old for toys, sir.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.386
Where is Isobel's estate?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.146
Lynchburg.

14:18.650 --> 14:22.472
That's, uh, Virginia, isn't it?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.236
Indeed it is.

14:27.740 --> 14:31.073
However, after I received
a letter from Jamie

14:31.160 --> 14:33.196
with news of the land grant
in North Carolina,

14:33.290 --> 14:35.997
I thought it wise to seek
a trusted friend's counsel

14:36.080 --> 14:37.570
on the particulars
of life in the Colonies.

14:39.330 --> 14:42.037
Counsel for you, or for the Governor?

14:42.710 --> 14:43.745
I beg your pardon?

14:45.420 --> 14:49.379
If the Governor has sent you
to ensure Jamie's loyalty,

14:50.140 --> 14:52.176
well, he's already given Tryon his word.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.977
Perhaps I've had too much wine,
but it...

14:58.480 --> 15:01.802
Well, it sounded as though you're
suggesting I'm here to spy upon him?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.015
Are you?

15:11.620 --> 15:15.943
If our stay here is proving burdensome,
you've only to say the word.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.201
No, it's no burden at all.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.036
I just wish I had time
to make appropriate

15:21.130 --> 15:23.371
sleeping arrangements
for you and the young master.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.506
It's hardly surprising he remembers you.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.556
When the lad said my name,

15:38.270 --> 15:39.840
my heart raced.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.722
I wanted to swing him through the air
as I did when he was a wee lad.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.736
Not so wee any more.

15:49.190 --> 15:50.441
Lad's sprouted,

15:51.110 --> 15:53.863
but he's still got
that same cock to his head.

15:54.990 --> 15:56.981
Familiar fire in his eyes.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.661
He is very handsome.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.529
Aye.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.085
When the lad was near three,

16:12.760 --> 16:17.675
Lord Dunsany brought him
to the stables for his first ride.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.885
He was terrified.

16:20.430 --> 16:23.263
Kept screaming his favourite word
at the time. "Mo."

16:24.020 --> 16:25.055
"M0."

16:25.150 --> 16:26.219
-Mo?
-Hmm.

16:27.110 --> 16:29.396
- Otherwise known as "no."
- Ah.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.947
But after I put the lad on my shoulders

16:33.030 --> 16:37.273
and let him speak
with the horse eye-to-eye,

16:38.990 --> 16:40.366
Willie embraced him.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.377
We couldn't keep him away after that.

16:46.170 --> 16:49.833
Even had his own way of brushing
the horses with short wee flicks.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.627
He obviously learned that
from watching you.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.420
Aye.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.510
His voice,

17:01.980 --> 17:05.268
when he asked if I was the groom.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.522
It was the memory of a stranger.

17:12.110 --> 17:14.351
He just needs to get to know you again.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.399
Aye.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.991
Come here.

17:32.010 --> 17:36.174
I've been dreaming
of a moment alone with you for weeks.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.174
Mmm.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.142
Isn't our guest waiting for you?

17:49.230 --> 17:50.436
Hmm.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.480
I suppose he is.

17:58.740 --> 17:59.775
Go.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.741
- Enjoy your game.
-Hmm.

18:03.330 --> 18:06.743
But as soon as our guests leave,

18:07.830 --> 18:10.207
I'll be expecting your full attention.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.676
Save some _
for the rest of us, WI” ye?

18:24.730 --> 18:29.599
So, ye continued yer acquaintanceship
with the warden after Ardsmuir, then?

18:29.690 --> 18:30.679
Aye.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.220
He saw to my parole.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.142
Grey's sympathies lie with Tryon,

18:36.990 --> 18:39.732
and with his dishonest sheriffs
and tax collectors.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.699
Yet my sympathies lie with the rats
ye'll be dining on once again

18:44.750 --> 18:46.536
when ye're imprisoned for taking the law
into your own hands

18:46.620 --> 18:48.110
if you're not careful.

18:48.870 --> 18:52.124
And we're to stand by
and watch a man build a palace

18:52.210 --> 18:54.121
while others are left wanting?

18:55.460 --> 18:56.836
I spoke with the Governor.

18:57.590 --> 19:02.425
He wishes to address the matter
and put an end to these complaints.

19:02.510 --> 19:05.889
So he can carry on
building his monument to elegance.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.718
And your guest keeps company
with men like Tryon.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.814
The Governor has no reason
to keep secrets from Grey.

19:17.150 --> 19:18.447
Talk to him.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.309
Find out what he knows.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.656
I'll not take advantage
of my friendship.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.956
Friendship?

19:33.960 --> 19:35.496
With an English Redcoat?

19:36.130 --> 19:37.620
Redcoat or not,

19:39.470 --> 19:40.710
Willie needs him.

19:41.130 --> 19:44.554
And what is it that concerns you so
about a lad you barely ken?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.681
Willie has lost two mothers.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.686
John Grey is all he has left.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.893
And how does that make the lad
your responSIbIIIty?

20:01.110 --> 20:02.099
He...

20:12.420 --> 20:15.583
He's yours, isn't he?

20:21.630 --> 20:23.427
Ye must keep this to yerself.

20:24.010 --> 20:27.673
Ye ken that the reputation
of Lord William Ransom,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.137
ninth Earl of Ellesmere would be ruined.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.609
He'd lose all he has
if anyone were to find out.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.350
Don't worry about me
keeping your secrets.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.566
I've kept them, each and every one.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.865
Does Claire know?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.739
Aye.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.953
When ye find the time,
perhaps ye can tell me about his mother.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.586
Unless that's a secret as well.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.840
You sure you want to make that move?

21:16.020 --> 21:17.009
Yes.

21:18.270 --> 21:19.259
Damn.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.309
Damn.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.286
Try a wee drop of this.

21:46.050 --> 21:49.292
You're meant to drink it, John,

21:49.390 --> 21:50.709
not savour the scent.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.350
Let me guess. It's meant to be whislq?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.021
After it ages a bit, it might be.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.652
Well, will you redeem your honour
with another game?

22:10.700 --> 22:11.860
Aye.

22:11.950 --> 22:14.612
You can hardly expect the same trick
to work twice, after all.

22:28.470 --> 22:29.880
Do you feel yourself content?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.420
I have all that a man could want.

22:37.980 --> 22:40.437
Home. Honourable work.

22:41.770 --> 22:43.431
My wife by my side.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.520
Good friends.

22:50.450 --> 22:54.693
And the knowledge
that my son is safe and well cared for.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.457
I want no more.

23:12.890 --> 23:16.553
Mistress Fraser,
your hospitality these past few days

23:16.640 --> 23:18.221
has been greatly appreciated.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.889
I'll, uh, escort you to the road that'll
have you on your way to Virginia.

23:23.980 --> 23:27.484
I don't think that's a good idea.
You're burning up.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.192
There's a measles epidemic
in Cross Creek.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.656
Did you travel through there?

23:34.120 --> 23:36.577
Yes. Have I got the measles?

23:37.200 --> 23:39.077
If so, you must keep William away.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.706
Open your mouth.

23:46.130 --> 23:48.007
How long have you been feeling ill?

23:48.590 --> 23:51.297
I felt somewhat lightheaded
when I retired last night.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.716
I awoke with a bad headache,

23:53.800 --> 23:57.304
but I thought it a consequence
of Jamie's so-called whislq.

23:57.390 --> 23:58.766
Yeah.

23:58.850 --> 24:01.011
Well, I'll put some willow bark
to steep.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.146
That will help with the headache.

24:02.230 --> 24:04.266
- Aye.
- But you need to rest.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.947
He's very infectious.

24:14.570 --> 24:16.652
Thank God you had measles as a child.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.323
Murtagh, as well. It willna infect us?

24:21.790 --> 24:25.282
No, nor me, either.
I've been inoculated.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.008
But William may have been exposed
to the same source as Lord John

24:29.300 --> 24:31.336
and just not shown signs of it yet.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.756
Pass me the pot.

24:38.970 --> 24:40.972
I'll have Murtagh stay here with me.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.306
But you'd better sleep outside
with William.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.516
You'd better stay away
for at least six days.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.149
Hopefully by then, John will be
well on his way to recovery.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.156
Or...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.070
I'll take the lad for a tour.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.990
Show him Fraser's Ridge.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.250
I'll look after him.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.380
Master William.

25:18.140 --> 25:19.425
Will you mount up?

25:21.310 --> 25:22.629
I'm not leaving.

25:27.730 --> 25:28.810
Come on.

25:31.990 --> 25:35.153
Come... Don't kick. It's ill-mannered.

25:35.910 --> 25:36.899
Now get up.

25:37.950 --> 25:40.191
Ah!

25:40.290 --> 25:43.248
It's very loyal of ye
to want to stay with your father,

25:43.330 --> 25:44.456
but ye canna help him.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.917
You may do yourself harm by staying.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.699
And don't try it.

25:53.420 --> 25:56.878
I dinna want to tie your feet
to the stirrups, but I will.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.966
Make no mistake.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.519
You, sir, are a lout.

26:12.190 --> 26:14.181
Ye still have a way with horses.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.019
Ye see these initials?

26:22.410 --> 26:25.368
You'll find similar markings
all along this area.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.379
They serve as a Treaty Line
between Indian land and the King's land.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.378
You must always stay
on this side of the marked trees.

26:36.550 --> 26:39.257
Why are the savages
permitted to remain on the land?

26:39.340 --> 26:40.887
Well, they were here first.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.637
And the Crown has already taken
most of it from them.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.432
The Indians respect the King's land,

26:48.520 --> 26:50.761
and we must respect theirs.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.818
These Indians, they are agreeable?

26:54.900 --> 26:56.106
Some.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.986
But they can be fierce when provoked.

27:13.210 --> 27:16.008
Have you ever seen
such a glorious thing before, sir?

27:18.430 --> 27:19.419
Neven

27:35.070 --> 27:36.435
Get you some tea.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.395
I'm most grateful, Mistress Fraser.

27:40.490 --> 27:41.479
Claire.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.447
Isobel truly believed
a cup of tea could cure any ill.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.580
I'm sorry.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.754
I had meant to offer you my condolences
on the loss of your wife.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.835
Thank you.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.591
Well, we had known each other
all our lives.

28:05.890 --> 28:08.427
She might as well have been my sister.

28:10.310 --> 28:12.050
Was she satisfied with that?

28:13.650 --> 28:14.935
To be your sister?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.942
You cannot be at all
a comfortable woman to live with.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.947
I believe she was satisfied
with the life she lived.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.110
She never said that she was not.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.071
I was an adequate husband to her.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.035
In all ways.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.338
That's not for me to judge.

28:37.420 --> 28:40.002
But you don't approve,
because if you did,

28:40.970 --> 28:43.177
you could not keep thinking of me
as you choose to.

28:43.510 --> 28:46.252
You shouldn't presume to know
what I think.

28:47.850 --> 28:52.059
You're envious of the time Jamie and I
shared together, and with William.

28:54.270 --> 28:57.762
You're envious of the fact
that I'm raising Jamie's son.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.019
Are you not?

29:05.780 --> 29:07.190
We have a daughter.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.742
Her name is Brianna.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.865
She's grown up now.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.029
She lives in Boston.

29:19.960 --> 29:23.964
But we were robbed of the opportunity
to raise her together

29:25.300 --> 29:26.540
because of Culloden.

29:29.510 --> 29:30.716
I meant no offence.

29:31.930 --> 29:34.137
No, but you did mean to imply

29:35.440 --> 29:38.898
that you and Jamie have something
together that we did not.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.192
Perhaps you're right about that.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.075
Let me ask you, what if your son

29:51.870 --> 29:54.828
takes a good look at Jamie's face
and sees his own?

29:55.370 --> 29:59.909
If he did learn
that he'd been lied to his entire life,

30:00.250 --> 30:01.660
he'd be devastated.

30:02.340 --> 30:06.925
So I can't for the life of me
understand your motivation

30:07.010 --> 30:08.329
for coming here.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.135
The obvious.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.636
To allow Jamie to see the boy.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.681
Or the other obvious.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.602
To allow you to see Jamie.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.997
You are a rather remarkable woman.

30:36.750 --> 30:37.865
In what way?

30:38.330 --> 30:41.037
You are neither circumspect
nor circuitous.

30:43.710 --> 30:46.042
I don't believe I've ever met anyone so

30:47.050 --> 30:49.086
devastatingly straightforward,

30:50.470 --> 30:51.880
male or female.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.471
Well, it's not by choice.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.646
I was born that way.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.740
So was I.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.542
I don't understand
why they're not taking the bait.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.097
Because that's a fly.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.058
Yes, one of the very best.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.549
Aye.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.687
But it's the wrong time of year.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.683
The fish are wise enough to ken
flies are not here.

31:46.900 --> 31:47.889
Try a worm.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.605
I don't use worms, sir.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.940
Ye did when ye were younger.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.110
D'ye not recall?

31:57.290 --> 31:58.860
After heavy rains at Helwater,

31:59.500 --> 32:01.616
we'd gather the wee beasties.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.621
I do remember some such thing.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.626
But I prefer fishing with a fly.

32:14.890 --> 32:17.927
The Indians dinna bother
with line and hook.

32:20.020 --> 32:24.889
Sometimes they place branches
to stop the fish from crossing.

32:26.520 --> 32:30.104
Then they stand with sharp sticks,
spearing them.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.860
What are you doing?

32:45.790 --> 32:46.950
Catching our dinner.

32:49.050 --> 32:55.046
Highlanders can catch fish
with bare hands and a tickle.

32:56.010 --> 32:57.090
A tickle?

32:57.680 --> 33:00.342
Please, sir, I'm not a child.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.232
- There.
- Yeah.

33:13.570 --> 33:15.868
Now, we'll have to
make camp for the night.

33:16.370 --> 33:19.407
Rise before dawn to find the best deer.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.741
Are we to hunt deer?

33:39.760 --> 33:40.920
Stand down, William.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.856
It was clearly a stag.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.686
Now you've let it get away.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.062
Well, the distance was too great
for a rifle.

33:53.150 --> 33:54.276
I could have injured it.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.349
Aye, and made it suffer.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.229
Ye shoot to kill.

33:59.490 --> 34:01.731
Ye ken how to deliver a fatal shot?

34:02.700 --> 34:03.746
Yes, sir.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.660
Aim for the heart.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.006
There.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.960
Easy.

34:19.220 --> 34:20.380
Easy.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.346
Take aim.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.100
Well done, lad.

34:35.190 --> 34:36.191
Thank you, sir.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.576
Where are you going?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.940
I'm allowing you time to dress the deer.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.822
Yer servants may have dressed the game
at home,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.332
but here in the New World,
we're not hunting for sport.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.837
Ye dinna prepare the gralloch,
ye dinna eat.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.619
Come here.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.086
You begin here.

34:58.090 --> 35:01.469
Angle your knife up like this,
then cut down the middle.

35:01.550 --> 35:04.519
And be sure to pull the meat
away from the offal as you cut it.

35:05.060 --> 35:08.097
Mistress Fraser will be upset
if you damage the intestines.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.339
She uses them for her healing.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.931
And I need a new bow string.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.276
That's it.

35:23.530 --> 35:24.986
Maybe you're not quite old enough.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.500
That's it.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.129
Good lad.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.975
How's the liver?

35:52.020 --> 35:54.602
- Delicious, sir.
- Aye.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.818
Yeah, my dad always said
it tastes better

35:58.900 --> 36:00.777
when you've earned every bite.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.949
Willie?

36:15.710 --> 36:17.450
- Master William?
- Yes?

36:18.880 --> 36:20.290
Do you feel unwell?

36:23.140 --> 36:26.462
Are you warm or feverish?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.090
I'm quite well, sir.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.939
Those dried apples not sit well?

36:38.650 --> 36:44.190
I have a potion that will cure
ills of the stomach.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.327
It'll not take long to brew.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.491
Claire made it.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.990
She's a fine healer.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.877
She said Papa would live.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.427
She gave me her word.

37:03.970 --> 37:05.506
Then you may depend upon it.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.013
I've had enough of sleeping
under the stars as savages do.

37:10.430 --> 37:11.556
I want to go home.

37:14.230 --> 37:15.800
Dinna fash, My Lord.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.186
We'll begin our journey home
in the morning.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.311
I want to see my papa now.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.696
It's too dark.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.560
This is all your fault.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.326
If my papa hadn't come to visit you,

37:29.410 --> 37:30.991
he never would have fallen ill.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.666
And...

37:36.750 --> 37:38.536
Now he's going to die.

38:47.910 --> 38:48.979
Oh, God.

38:50.740 --> 38:53.038
Oh, God. My head will surely split.

38:58.250 --> 39:01.538
Here, let me try some acupressure.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.501
See if it won't ease the pain.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.387
That's it.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.521
Am I to die today?

39:30.030 --> 39:31.907
Your temperature's very high.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.479
We need to bring it down.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.030
I need to make a confession.

39:45.130 --> 39:47.121
When I heard that Isobel had died,

39:50.550 --> 39:51.881
I felt nothing.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.301
We shared a life.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.556
I should have felt something.

40:04.690 --> 40:05.930
But I didn't.

40:07.740 --> 40:09.276
Just relax.

40:09.860 --> 40:11.851
You asked me why I came here.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.322
I came to see whether I can still feel.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.912
Whether it is my feelings
that have died,

40:28.010 --> 40:29.466
or only Isobel.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.419
And?

40:38.020 --> 40:40.477
I can still feel shame, at least.

40:47.190 --> 40:48.726
Oh, it's hard.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.731
It's hard watching you with him.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.086
Why torture yourself?

41:09.050 --> 41:13.464
Surely you knew, coming here,
that you could never have him.

41:14.050 --> 41:16.006
Oh, I could have had him.

41:20.220 --> 41:21.221
What?

41:21.850 --> 41:25.263
In exchange for my commitment
to serve as William's father,

41:27.480 --> 41:29.311
Jamie offered himself to me.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.100
Of course, I refused.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.486
I would never take him on those terms.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.990
You should stop talking.

41:48.170 --> 41:49.706
You need your rest.

42:13.900 --> 42:14.980
Willie?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.155
William!

43:05.120 --> 43:06.109
William?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.325
Look what I found.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.120
You shouldn't be here.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.666
It's to break our fast.

43:16.090 --> 43:17.296
I thought I told you...

43:17.380 --> 43:18.426
Savages.

43:20.590 --> 43:21.796
Stay calm.

44:02.220 --> 44:06.509
The boy took fish
from the place of the Cherokee.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.017
He must pay with his blood.

44:10.690 --> 44:12.976
No,no,no!

44:13.360 --> 44:16.727
The boy is my son!
His blood is my blood.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.685
Take mine instead.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.490
I won't go without you.

44:30.580 --> 44:31.660
Yes, you will.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.911
Follow the stream
back to Fraser's Ridge.

44:36.250 --> 44:38.878
May the Lord protect her,
her and the children.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.292
No, no, he's not my father!
He's not my father!

44:44.390 --> 44:46.961
He showed me the boundaries,
but I did not respect them.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.516
I alone stole your fish.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.680
Stand down, Willie.

44:59.490 --> 45:03.483
No. No, no! Willie, no!

45:03.570 --> 45:04.616
No!

45:44.200 --> 45:46.771
I dinna ken the meaning
of all they're saying, but...

45:49.080 --> 45:51.696
I believe their mercy was due to you.

45:57.790 --> 45:59.087
Your courage.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.056
I must beg your forgiveness.

46:13.310 --> 46:17.189
My lack of discretion, it

46:19.900 --> 46:21.356
pierces my very core.

46:21.570 --> 46:22.889
You were very ill.

46:23.610 --> 46:24.895
It's no excuse.

46:27.820 --> 46:29.117
But you were wrong.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.400
Knowing you have Jamie,
and I never will,

46:32.490 --> 46:33.821
is not that which grieves me.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.497
It's a truth to which I am reconciled.

46:43.130 --> 46:45.837
It's witnessing the satisfaction
on your face that wounds me.

46:47.300 --> 46:48.961
Something I could never give Isobel.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.058
Do you know what it's like
to love someone

46:54.140 --> 46:56.096
and never be able
to give them happiness?

46:56.520 --> 46:58.932
Not through any fault
of yours or theirs,

46:59.020 --> 47:04.356
but simply because you were not born
the right person for them?

47:10.700 --> 47:12.156
I understand.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.746
All too well.

47:18.870 --> 47:20.451
When I thought

47:21.710 --> 47:23.871
Jamie was dead, I...

47:26.760 --> 47:29.081
I was married to another man.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.056
A good man.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.175
But...

47:43.650 --> 47:46.392
I must ask for your forgiveness, too.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.599
You were right.

47:50.030 --> 47:52.316
I suppose I am envious

47:52.660 --> 47:55.788
of the time you spent with Jamie.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.038
We were deprived of 20 years together.

48:09.010 --> 48:10.875
Now that you've come here

48:14.100 --> 48:15.306
and seen him,

48:19.940 --> 48:21.646
do you still have feelings?

48:24.650 --> 48:25.856
I do.

48:28.110 --> 48:29.236
Yes.

48:32.030 --> 48:33.270
God help me.

48:44.380 --> 48:47.838
When you said you have nothing of Jamie,

48:48.840 --> 48:50.080
you were wrong.

48:54.050 --> 48:55.426
You have William.

49:09.820 --> 49:11.947
Do you remember the day
you left Helwater?

49:13.490 --> 49:14.479
Aye.

49:17.740 --> 49:19.071
I ran to you.

49:20.950 --> 49:22.861
But you did not look back at me.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.666
Why did you not look back at me?

49:34.930 --> 49:36.215
I wanted to.

49:41.100 --> 49:42.636
I didn't look because

49:43.690 --> 49:45.590
I didn't want to give ye false hope.

49:47.770 --> 49:49.601
I never expected to see you again.

49:58.700 --> 49:59.689
William.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.449
Here.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.340
He's well.

50:18.970 --> 50:20.255
And no longer contagious.

50:22.930 --> 50:24.136
All right, lad.

50:24.690 --> 50:25.884
Papa.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.770
I trust he was well-behaved for you.

50:41.080 --> 50:44.072
William was a very brave
travel companion.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.746
You've raised him well.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.291
You're a good father.

50:56.380 --> 50:58.041
You're fortunate to have each other.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.135
How can I repay your kindness?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.305
You can get plenty of rest.

51:11.270 --> 51:12.931
And eat well.

51:13.230 --> 51:16.233
Lots of carrots and squash and liver.

51:18.570 --> 51:19.810
And...

51:21.780 --> 51:22.940
Don't lose hope.

51:25.200 --> 51:26.656
You, too,

51:26.960 --> 51:31.124
deserve to have the look
of satisfaction on your face.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.096
You sure you remember the way?

51:49.480 --> 51:50.515
Yes, sir.

52:00.570 --> 52:02.276
I'd be delighted if you accept this.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.519
Your chess set?

52:04.620 --> 52:06.611
- No, John, I canna...
- Please.

52:07.330 --> 52:10.367
It will give me great pleasure to think
of you having a game now and then.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.529
Perhaps you'll teach your nephew.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.586
I look forward to it.

52:15.750 --> 52:18.002
I'm afraid the time has come
to bid you all farewell.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.547
A pleasure, Mistress Fraser.

52:23.390 --> 52:24.800
The pleasure is all mine.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.056
Good luck to you both.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.708
Well, I hope Murtagh
comes to see us again soon.

53:35.790 --> 53:39.703
He'll not stay away now that he's had
a taste of your fine cooking.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.249
Mmm.

53:48.720 --> 53:49.709
Hmm.

53:52.060 --> 53:53.630
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

54:01.900 --> 54:03.731
So often I've burned for ye.

54:06.360 --> 54:07.941
This water on your skin.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.286
Caressing you.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.996
Makes me jealous of the rain itself.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.079
Hmm.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.387
Your kisses raining down on me.

54:31.140 --> 54:34.132
Is it a drizzle or a torrent?

54:35.140 --> 54:37.142
I'll bathe you in them.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.694
Then I should hurry up.

54:49.490 --> 54:52.152
You'll have no need
of cloth tonight, Sassenach.

54:53.330 --> 54:56.072
Well, that's not fair.
You're still fully clothed.

54:57.210 --> 54:59.826
There are times
when a husband kens best.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.332
And I am your husband.

55:03.130 --> 55:04.620
Though ye'd never ken it.

55:09.430 --> 55:13.548
I don't need a ring
to know how much you love me.

55:13.890 --> 55:15.016
No.

55:17.980 --> 55:19.436
But it helps.

55:42.090 --> 55:43.284
Jamie.

55:47.590 --> 55:49.421
It's so beautiful.

55:50.550 --> 55:51.847
Where is it from?

55:52.510 --> 55:54.091
I had Murtagh make it.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.550
From one of the silver candlesticks.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.436
I ken my mother

56:00.150 --> 56:01.594
would give her blessing

56:02.610 --> 56:05.022
to fashion part of it
into a ring for ye.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.896
She would be proud

56:09.700 --> 56:12.772
to know that she raised
such a thoughtful son.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.127
Oh, there's an inscription.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.880
Give me a thousand kisses.

56:51.910 --> 56:54.481
And I'll give you a thousand more.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.640
One.

57:37.030 --> 57:38.019
Two.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.950
Three.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.659
Five.

57:51.050 --> 57:53.086
Five?
