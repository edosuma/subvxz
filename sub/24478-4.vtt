WEBVTT

00:01.931 --> 00:03.965
Previously on In Contempt...

00:05.344 --> 00:06.827
Judge Dodson!

00:06.965 --> 00:08.379
Guys, this is Bennet Thompson.

00:08.517 --> 00:10.551
He is gonna shadow Gwen'’s case.

00:10.689 --> 00:11.965
Oh my God!

00:12.103 --> 00:13.379
Does anyone care about
the law around here?

00:13.517 --> 00:15.000
Call it a performance review.

00:15.137 --> 00:17.482
- She'll do great.
- Not her... You.

00:17.793 --> 00:19.310
So our case looks like
a losing battle,

00:19.448 --> 00:21.793
which is unfortunate
since our client is innocent.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.586
We, the Jury,
find the defendant...

00:23.724 --> 00:24.965
Not guilty.

00:25.241 --> 00:27.931
Gwen, this is
Alison, my fiancée.

00:28.068 --> 00:30.000
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:40.586 --> 00:43.344
Gwen, I will
pay you 5000 dollars

00:43.482 --> 00:45.172
to go back to bed.

00:45.655 --> 00:47.379
How did it go with Bennet?

00:48.655 --> 00:50.034
Spin it to back?

00:50.310 --> 00:51.793
Are you the back?

00:52.413 --> 00:54.827
Last night was great.
I'm great.

00:54.965 --> 00:56.793
Bennet is great.
His fiancée is great.

00:56.931 --> 01:00.000
Okay, you are not making as much
sense as tits on a bull.

01:00.137 --> 01:02.206
- What fiancée?
- Alison!

01:02.344 --> 01:05.448
She is beautiful,
smart and with perfect teeth.

01:07.793 --> 01:09.896
So, Alison is the back.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.379
Clearly, I misread
the situation.

01:12.517 --> 01:13.655
He is not into me at all.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.413
Here's a thought,
go for him anyway.

01:15.551 --> 01:17.344
It'’s wrong
on so many levels, Trace.

01:17.482 --> 01:21.172
- It's thirsty and it's sad.
- Or it'’s bold and decisive.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.965
He ain'’t married yet.
In my book, that'’s fair game.

01:24.103 --> 01:25.448
In your book,
married is a fair game.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.103
Yeah, now you are learning.

01:42.413 --> 01:48.310
All right, last year,
we processed 238,482 cases.

01:48.655 --> 01:50.655
We did 660 trials.

01:50.896 --> 01:56.206
But there are still
12,934 pending cases.

01:56.379 --> 01:59.758
And we have 174 cases
that are over two years old.

01:59.965 --> 02:01.482
Now I know you all've
been killing yourselves,

02:01.620 --> 02:04.000
but we got to keep
pushing them through.

02:04.310 --> 02:07.206
- Victor.
- All right, I deliberate.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.586
And we love you forward,
but you gotta do it faster.

02:12.655 --> 02:13.827
All right, any other business?

02:13.965 --> 02:15.827
I have a very possible
Jury tempering.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.931
- Specifically?
- My last trial.

02:18.068 --> 02:20.310
One Juror told
the other Juror she overheard

02:20.448 --> 02:23.172
the defendant's lawyer
very publicly say

02:23.413 --> 02:24.896
I wouldn'’t admit evidence

02:25.034 --> 02:28.241
regarding an alibi witness
or an alternative suspect.

02:28.379 --> 02:29.896
And the verdict was not guilty?

02:30.482 --> 02:32.034
You want to refer her
for an investigation?

02:32.172 --> 02:33.379
Your call.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.620
In a couple hours, it'’ll just
make me guilty on my own word.

02:36.758 --> 02:39.517
It'’s not your word, Mike.
It'’s evidence.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.896
I'’ve got an undercover that
make sure this is happening.

02:42.034 --> 02:43.241
You're marked by money.

02:43.379 --> 02:45.103
Heroin in your pockets
and matching bag.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.793
My mom needed her meds.
She'’s got stage 4 lymphoma.

02:48.931 --> 02:50.034
And my grandma's
in a wheelchair--

02:50.172 --> 02:51.620
Ah! Flag on the play.

02:51.827 --> 02:53.931
Your mom had cancer
last time at operations.

02:54.068 --> 02:56.586
And your grandma
passed two years ago.

02:56.724 --> 02:58.172
Okay, okay.

02:59.724 --> 03:01.275
What happens if I blow a trail?

03:01.413 --> 03:02.551
15, max.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.862
This judge, maybe 12?

03:06.896 --> 03:09.000
I just turned 30 two weeks ago.

03:09.758 --> 03:11.137
I'’m tired, you know?

03:11.827 --> 03:14.655
I wanna walk out of here.
And I want to make a change.

03:15.827 --> 03:17.413
What about a drug program?

03:18.758 --> 03:20.068
I'’ll ask again.

03:20.206 --> 03:21.724
Well, if not that,
I'’m just gonna fight it.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.689
If anybody can get me
that NG, it'’s you.

03:26.586 --> 03:27.586
All right.

03:28.965 --> 03:30.275
Hello, Your Honor.

03:31.034 --> 03:33.655
Keep moving,
can'’t be seen with you.

03:35.586 --> 03:36.827
What were you thinking?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.724
What are you
talking about, honey?

03:38.862 --> 03:40.793
They think you are
tempting with the Jury.

03:41.275 --> 03:43.517
Till it gets resolved,
you have to quit tonight.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.517
People vs. Brendon Bulknis.
Step up.

03:58.862 --> 04:00.241
Who is that?

04:00.379 --> 04:01.931
You have been creeping
at her for like 20 minutes.

04:02.068 --> 04:03.793
Alison Bontemps.
She'’s Bennet'’s fiancée.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.586
- Bennet is engaged?
- Yes, and not to be.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.482
You like him?

04:10.896 --> 04:12.068
She'’s gorge--

04:12.931 --> 04:14.310
Has a strong face.

04:15.034 --> 04:16.586
They are going to this
restaurant tonight.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.310
I was thinking about
showing up. Is that stalkery?

04:18.448 --> 04:19.689
Sort of.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.241
But also, why do you
do that to yourself?

04:21.379 --> 04:23.206
I don'’t know.
I guess I just want to see

04:23.344 --> 04:25.724
what she has that I don'’t,
why he chose her.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.482
Then, I can poison her.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.241
- Who'’s this, a new model?
- Bennet'’s fiancée.

04:30.344 --> 04:31.758
Oh my God, I'’m sorry. I--

04:32.000 --> 04:33.103
He made me nervous.

04:33.241 --> 04:35.137
He is here
to evaluate me, not you.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.793
So now just listen,

04:36.931 --> 04:38.655
remember it'’s all
about your client,

04:38.793 --> 04:40.000
he may look like a creep--

04:40.137 --> 04:42.137
He is a creep.
He's a subway robber.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.517
Doesn'’t matter.
He is your client.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.172
So you need to drop devotion.

04:45.310 --> 04:47.034
The court room
is all about the unspoken.

04:47.172 --> 04:49.103
The Jury is gonna look at the
way you talk with your client.

04:49.241 --> 04:50.931
The way you look at him,
the way you touch him.

04:51.068 --> 04:52.655
- I can'’t touch him.
- You have to touch him.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.551
Just a soft, I can touch you
on the shoulder.

04:54.689 --> 04:56.310
Something that telegraphs
that you are not afraid.

04:56.448 --> 04:57.758
You know that he is a human.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.655
You can do this.
Just go slow and be confident.

05:00.793 --> 05:04.758
Doc in 8788,
People vs. Jordan Sambal.

05:04.896 --> 05:05.827
Step up.

05:05.965 --> 05:07.310
Thank you.

05:12.655 --> 05:13.965
The defendant robbed up

05:14.103 --> 05:15.896
against a woman
on the subway, Your Honor,

05:16.034 --> 05:17.862
for the 12th time.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.689
He was on his way
to the Probation Department

05:19.827 --> 05:22.206
to check in with his PO.
Because he's... Guess what?

05:22.344 --> 05:24.172
- On probation.
- For robbing, I suppose.

05:24.413 --> 05:26.206
The woman he robbed up
against happened to be

05:26.344 --> 05:27.448
another probation officer.

05:27.586 --> 05:29.586
Oh, that'’s some bad luck, huh?

05:29.724 --> 05:30.931
It was a crowded subway.

05:31.103 --> 05:33.172
Frank Bins? Or just Frank?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.172
What?

05:38.965 --> 05:41.103
Oh my God, I'’m sorry. Frank.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.758
Nobody saw the pintos
or the bock seats, Your Honor.

05:44.137 --> 05:45.137
Cute.

05:45.275 --> 05:46.724
Okay, so we've got
a 12 times

05:46.862 --> 05:49.206
losing independent
subway robbery.

05:49.344 --> 05:50.758
I'’m gonna give him 90 days.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.758
90 days is a good deal, Jordan.

05:52.896 --> 05:54.310
I don'’t see you have
much of defense here.

05:54.448 --> 05:56.172
But they are lying
about the records.

05:56.931 --> 05:59.379
- I'll make a bail.
- So, reject the offer.

06:01.379 --> 06:03.448
My client respectfully
declines the offer.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.379
I don'’t know what you're
thinking, counselor.

06:05.517 --> 06:07.379
But it'’s time
your client realized

06:07.586 --> 06:08.931
this is the end of the line.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.862
I'll mark the court paper saying

06:11.000 --> 06:13.862
no less than 90 days and set
the a bail of 10,000 dollars.

06:14.275 --> 06:17.172
Jordan, this much space
between you and anyone else.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.586
From now on. You got it?

06:18.724 --> 06:20.862
If you have any urges.

06:21.103 --> 06:22.827
Call before you do
anything stupid.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.068
People vs...

06:25.482 --> 06:28.586
- Did you give him your number?
- No, I gave him yours.

06:29.034 --> 06:30.206
What?

06:36.931 --> 06:38.862
Tell me that is Salami Vinion'’s.

06:39.068 --> 06:40.724
Oh, I love you.

06:41.103 --> 06:42.965
Okay, so another round
of 20 questions

06:43.103 --> 06:44.896
in Guessing Who Tracy
Had Sex with Game?

06:45.172 --> 06:47.344
- Okay, next question?
- Dopson.

06:47.758 --> 06:49.103
Where did that come from?

06:49.241 --> 06:50.689
Because you
dialed out to me last night.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.482
And the things
I heard him doing to you.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.827
You were nasty.

06:53.965 --> 06:55.551
Unless you disappear
in front of him

06:55.689 --> 06:57.275
the courtroom, never...

06:57.482 --> 06:58.551
Be the same.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.034
More importantly, are you crazy?

07:00.172 --> 07:01.724
I was born as a pea charger.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.172
A, I don'’t know what that means.

07:03.310 --> 07:04.586
B, you know that he can
disbar you, right?

07:04.724 --> 07:07.275
Honey, of course I know.
Nice and through.

07:09.172 --> 07:11.482
Okay. No pizza.
What'’s going on?

07:11.620 --> 07:14.034
We are coming back to this,
but I'’m saving my appetites

07:14.172 --> 07:15.896
for my Bennet and Alison dinner.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.482
That Alison, eh-huh.
I saw her photo.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.931
God, you can have him easy.

07:20.068 --> 07:21.862
I'’m not trying to steal her man.

07:22.344 --> 07:23.620
Then what are you
doing this for?

07:23.758 --> 07:25.068
I just want to see.

07:25.206 --> 07:26.586
Why did she get bit on?

07:26.724 --> 07:28.310
I'’m the one who is doing
guard'’s work here.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.172
Why am I not blessing
and have the love in my life?

07:30.517 --> 07:31.827
Maybe you are. Huh?

07:31.965 --> 07:33.517
Maybe he just wants to
see how bad you are.

07:33.655 --> 07:35.310
Some cases for you,
ladies in cover?

07:35.448 --> 07:36.758
- You are not allowed--
- Yeah, we are going to

07:36.896 --> 07:38.517
do the trail right away,
Mr. Charlie.

07:38.655 --> 07:41.310
- Hey, hi, sorry to interrupt.
- Hey, make yourself useful.

07:41.448 --> 07:43.758
Give this notice of actual
engagement to Judge Hernandez.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.896
Wait. You are not trying to
stash and cash, are you?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.482
That'’s what my client wants.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.551
Have you mentioned
the little bit issue of money?

07:50.689 --> 07:52.379
Or the matching drug stash?

07:52.586 --> 07:54.068
No, that'’s not a winable case.

07:54.206 --> 07:55.793
Someone told me to plea the
guy who wants a trial.

07:55.931 --> 07:57.931
Did you even bother asking
for him a drug program?

07:58.068 --> 07:59.482
The Judge would never go for it

07:59.620 --> 08:01.172
and I don'’t think my
guy would complete it.

08:01.310 --> 08:03.000
I just hate asking.
That makes him sound guilty.

08:03.137 --> 08:04.862
Charlie, you have to
get him a program.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.724
Talk to his mother.
Get her to plea this case.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.758
Just say she has to go
to the Bureau Chief.

08:08.896 --> 08:11.344
You know it'’s insane to roll
the dice on the stash and cash.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.482
- Really?
- Sorry, I stopped listening.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.241
- I'll call his mom.
- Okay.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.655
You think the song comes up

08:16.793 --> 08:18.482
just to her your crowd,
don't you?

08:19.655 --> 08:20.793
I'’ll do it.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.241
You wanna see some trail action?

08:22.379 --> 08:23.793
I have a big pile
of in-box coming.

08:23.931 --> 08:25.310
Wait, she is shadowing
me this week.

08:25.448 --> 08:26.793
I was teaching her
how to connect with the...

08:26.931 --> 08:30.310
Wait... Gosh, oh,
I forgot, the clients.

08:31.275 --> 08:33.724
- Is that pizza gluten-free?
- What?

08:34.068 --> 08:35.724
You know what, forget about it.
I can use a little.

08:35.862 --> 08:38.206
What'’s next? Hookers in a pole?

08:39.551 --> 08:42.206
All right, ladies,
thank you for lunch.

08:42.482 --> 08:44.655
And thank YOU for
being a teacher.

08:46.931 --> 08:49.413
No, eh-huh, no, mine.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.896
Hey, someone
dropped this off.

08:54.206 --> 08:56.172
Notice of engagement
for Miss Sarris.

09:11.034 --> 09:13.034
You trial was a little
late to find Jesus.

09:13.172 --> 09:14.379
Jesus walked with your client.

09:14.517 --> 09:15.793
He can'’t walk with my client?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.206
It won'’t happen until
the last minute.

09:17.482 --> 09:18.896
Like the Valero case.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.344
Sorry, I have to scold him.

09:20.482 --> 09:22.137
Why do you go so hard
on these drug cases?

09:22.275 --> 09:23.862
You are the guy who are back
in the day or something?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.655
Look at you! Am I shrinking
out or am I an amateur?

09:27.137 --> 09:29.206
He will plea if you
approve a drug program.

09:29.724 --> 09:30.827
For a three-time fellow?

09:31.517 --> 09:35.034
It was suggested an earlier
sentence since a long time ago.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.034
Whip a dog hard enough,
he'll learn.

09:37.172 --> 09:39.517
I'’m talking about 18 months
of a real residential rehab.

09:39.655 --> 09:41.517
And I'’m talking about
letting him use some prison.

09:41.655 --> 09:42.586
Oh, come on!

09:42.724 --> 09:43.896
There was a record of max of 15.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.482
Kevin won'’t give more than 12.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.413
Or maybe my office
will say he would be.

09:47.862 --> 09:48.931
If you don'’t like it,

09:49.310 --> 09:50.827
then you can shred the case.

09:51.206 --> 09:52.344
But don'’t come around me

09:52.482 --> 09:54.034
when your little dolphin
needs some meds.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.241
You can'’t win this.

09:59.034 --> 10:02.241
So, if I were you,
I wouldn'’t smile.

10:02.862 --> 10:04.172
Stay here for 11 years.

10:04.344 --> 10:05.758
Say thank you.

10:08.551 --> 10:09.758
You read me.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.379
And thank you wasn'’t
what I had in my mind.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.034
This house is about to go down

10:14.172 --> 10:16.620
after you show up
with the bow tie

10:16.758 --> 10:18.310
and show something
to that Jury.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.689
It'’s about I mess with
your case as much as I can

10:20.827 --> 10:22.103
Or I can'’t win.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.793
After the undercover
officer rendered in

10:32.931 --> 10:34.241
the description of the suspect,

10:34.379 --> 10:35.310
what did you do?

10:35.655 --> 10:37.206
I ordered the back-up
team to move in.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.103
I spied the Defendant
25 feet away

10:39.241 --> 10:40.413
From the guy went down.

10:40.862 --> 10:42.655
And did he match the description

10:42.793 --> 10:44.034
provided by the undercover?

10:44.310 --> 10:47.482
String hair, black jeans,
black baseball cap.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.896
He also had the buying
money and the stash on.

10:50.034 --> 10:51.551
Can you explain it to the Juror?

10:52.034 --> 10:53.827
Undercovers use mock money.

10:54.172 --> 10:55.551
Right down the serial numbers

10:55.689 --> 10:56.931
so we arrest someone

10:57.068 --> 10:58.310
we can see if they
have the same bills.

10:58.793 --> 11:00.758
The Defendant had
this monk money on.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.172
Two fives and a ten.

11:02.482 --> 11:03.793
Anything else?

11:03.931 --> 11:06.103
Different sellers stamp
their glassy heroin bags

11:06.241 --> 11:07.586
With different designs.

11:07.896 --> 11:10.103
Eh... The heroin the
undercover bought

11:10.241 --> 11:13.793
Was labeled "“Cop Killer"”
with two Ks and two Ps.

11:14.068 --> 11:16.551
Mr. Kyle had 12 bags of
these "“Cop Killer"” on him

11:16.689 --> 11:17.758
When he was arrested.

11:17.896 --> 11:19.482
Thank you.

11:22.344 --> 11:23.206
Have fun.

11:25.448 --> 11:28.551
That description, the one you
said match so perfectly.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.275
That must be recorded
by the 911 system

11:31.413 --> 11:32.896
When the undercover
transmitted it.

11:33.034 --> 11:35.413
No, we used a secure channel
When we undercover.

11:35.551 --> 11:36.758
So there'’s no recording about

11:36.896 --> 11:38.241
What that description
really was?

11:38.379 --> 11:39.689
I wrote it down when
it came over the air.

11:41.379 --> 11:42.793
How do we know that?

11:43.896 --> 11:45.344
I just testified to it.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.827
Hum, okay,

11:47.172 --> 11:48.827
you have a cell phone
to take pictures, right?

11:48.965 --> 11:50.896
One with a time and
location stamps on them?

11:51.034 --> 11:52.413
What'’s your point, counselor?

11:52.551 --> 11:54.413
Just want to know what
time you took the picture

11:54.551 --> 11:55.413
of the buy money.

11:55.551 --> 11:56.827
There'’s no photographs.

11:56.965 --> 11:58.482
How do we know you wrote
the serial numbers

11:58.620 --> 12:00.275
Before the arrest
instead of after?

12:00.413 --> 12:01.758
We can'’t, counselor.

12:01.896 --> 12:04.206
I just testify under
oath that we did so.

12:04.344 --> 12:06.241
Right, but I am
asking some proof.

12:06.379 --> 12:07.620
Are you accusing me?

12:07.758 --> 12:09.310
Sounds like you'’re
calling me a liar.

12:09.448 --> 12:11.517
I'’m asking, because how
do we know you are not?

12:11.655 --> 12:14.000
Okay, let'’s move it along, guys.

12:15.586 --> 12:17.034
Did you get my
client'’s fingerprint

12:17.172 --> 12:18.620
From any of the heroin glasses?

12:18.758 --> 12:21.689
- We don'’t test for that.
- Right, let me guess.

12:21.827 --> 12:23.275
Except actual evidence,

12:23.413 --> 12:25.241
your testimony should be enough.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.896
Hey, my team and I
are out there everyday

12:28.034 --> 12:29.551
Fighting to save
your communities.

12:29.689 --> 12:31.793
Now on behalf of your community

12:31.931 --> 12:33.689
Let me say we feel much better

12:33.827 --> 12:36.965
if you show up with
some actual evidence.

12:39.448 --> 12:40.965
I'’m done with you.

12:45.655 --> 12:48.000
So, tell me why you
the best choice

12:48.137 --> 12:49.103
for the Supervisor?

12:49.620 --> 12:51.172
You got to teach him
the fundamentals,

12:51.862 --> 12:55.034
skills, and sentimental.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.862
A Supervisor is
supposed to nurse you,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.310
mentor you, patch you up when
the system gets you down.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.827
I think we should have a giant
white board in the office.

13:01.965 --> 13:03.689
With everyone'’s
win-lost record.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.344
A giant white board...

13:05.482 --> 13:07.551
I know our clients,
and I would help everyone

13:07.689 --> 13:09.793
that I supervisor become the
best lawyer they could be.

13:09.931 --> 13:11.379
I'’m in your platinum category.

13:11.517 --> 13:12.931
It'’s what I was called to do.

13:13.517 --> 13:17.551
It'’s my domra as,
as a UD, I'’d say.

13:17.724 --> 13:20.379
More valuable, hard to attain

13:20.724 --> 13:22.413
worth helping and worth
keeping.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.034
Come on, Tom,

13:24.172 --> 13:25.758
would I be here
if I was for the money?

13:26.344 --> 13:27.689
No offense, but...

13:27.931 --> 13:28.793
And seriously,

13:28.931 --> 13:30.137
you don'’t have anyone

13:30.275 --> 13:31.344
Who can trial a case
better than me.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.344
And no one, and I mean no one

13:33.655 --> 13:35.586
trials a case better than me.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.137
Small Tofu steak,

13:47.517 --> 13:48.586
40 dollars.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.655
I can smell my latch
brew for the price here.

13:53.172 --> 13:56.724
So, you are still having
financial difficulties?

13:57.206 --> 13:58.206
No, just jokes.

13:58.827 --> 14:00.896
I'’m paying my bills,
taking care of business,

14:01.034 --> 14:01.862
I'’m good.

14:04.103 --> 14:05.758
So, David is giving
house to Louis.

14:05.896 --> 14:07.758
Need to talk about where
he'’s going to live.

14:08.551 --> 14:10.379
It'’s up to me
to take care of my son.

14:10.965 --> 14:12.344
Please allow me to do that.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.448
Okay, just you haven'’t
got to see him.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.482
God know how you will feel.

14:18.172 --> 14:20.482
I mean, I keep asking
you to see me in court

14:20.620 --> 14:22.000
And you haven'’t.

14:22.137 --> 14:24.689
I guess I said, Gwen,
I'’ll be there when I can.

14:30.034 --> 14:32.448
Hi, Bennet, what a world!

14:33.206 --> 14:35.068
- Good to see you!
- Judge, what a surprise.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.344
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:36.862 --> 14:38.103
Gwen, you'’ve met Allison.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.068
Of course. Good to see you.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.206
You wanna join us?

14:42.206 --> 14:44.103
- We'’d love to.
- Yeah, sure.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.517
- Why not?
- Thank you.

14:51.931 --> 14:53.206
Hang on.

14:57.379 --> 14:58.310
What are you doing here?

14:58.448 --> 14:59.827
I did hear something about me

14:59.965 --> 15:02.034
being a very BAD girl.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.103
I'’ll talk to you tomorrow.

15:05.758 --> 15:07.689
Hernandez may refer
you to DA office

15:07.827 --> 15:08.793
for a jury tempering.

15:08.965 --> 15:11.655
It does sound very serious.

15:12.758 --> 15:13.689
What'’s the matter with you?

15:14.448 --> 15:15.620
You could lose your law license.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.758
God, everybody
keeps saying that.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.413
Did you get any specifics?

15:20.551 --> 15:22.827
I wasn'’t in a position to probe.

15:25.034 --> 15:26.620
Is there anything
you wanna tell me?

15:30.068 --> 15:32.793
Why don'’t you stop being
on scaredy pants

15:33.344 --> 15:34.655
And probe this?

15:44.275 --> 15:46.758
This is very pretty...
for rabbit food.

15:47.517 --> 15:49.413
So, are you really
a vegan or a B-gan?

15:50.172 --> 15:52.379
Vegan won'’t eat like anything
that doesn'’t have mud

15:52.517 --> 15:53.896
like fries, pies...

15:54.034 --> 15:55.862
I'’m a real vegan,
and I'’m gluten free

15:56.000 --> 15:58.896
Salt free, sugar free,
I know, sounds...

15:59.103 --> 16:01.379
My God, must be
driving you crazy,

16:01.517 --> 16:03.000
Mr. Burger & Fries

16:03.413 --> 16:05.137
I don'’t eat anymore.
She converted me.

16:05.275 --> 16:08.551
You know, Alison, this spring
rolls are not as good as yours.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.068
You make him spring rolls?

16:11.206 --> 16:12.724
I actually handmade everything.

16:12.862 --> 16:15.103
When we travel, I picked cooking
basket from the locals.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.275
It'’s just a hobby, but...

16:16.413 --> 16:19.379
Stop it!
Alison is starting a book

16:19.517 --> 16:21.724
about how to be a
gluten-free eater.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.000
That is great.

16:25.379 --> 16:27.551
So, Gwen, what are
you doing for fun?

16:29.137 --> 16:31.517
She practices boxing,
so you need to be nice to her.

16:31.655 --> 16:32.517
Okay.

16:33.310 --> 16:34.931
It'’s really the best.

16:35.068 --> 16:36.827
It'’s my destresser, and
it'’s a total-body workout.

16:36.965 --> 16:39.482
I mean, can we all say
Botley is intelligence?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.413
My hand-brain
coordination is crazy.

16:42.586 --> 16:46.310
With all the rotation and
movement, my muscles are tight.

16:52.517 --> 16:53.448
Jordan?

16:53.758 --> 16:56.551
No, keep your junk
in your pants.

16:56.965 --> 16:58.689
Do not leave the house.

16:59.344 --> 17:01.103
I don'’t know.
Put an ice pack on it.

17:01.241 --> 17:03.931
Don'’t get on the subway.
I'’m not kidding. I'’m hanging up.

17:05.689 --> 17:07.068
Sorry.

17:07.206 --> 17:08.689
Wow, Bennet has been telling
me about your cases.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.000
But they sound more stresses.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.000
I have a serial subway rubber.

17:14.620 --> 17:16.275
- Our father is.
- A voodoo?

17:16.620 --> 17:18.344
It'’s from the French church

17:18.482 --> 17:21.689
or describe a French term.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.344
I know that.

17:24.482 --> 17:26.724
It'’s been a lot of years since
I studied French and history.

17:27.241 --> 17:28.758
That'’s very impressive.

17:28.931 --> 17:29.931
Thank you.

17:33.310 --> 17:34.413
Have you got to the bottom

17:34.551 --> 17:36.172
of that Jury situation?

17:36.310 --> 17:37.655
I interview the person.

17:37.827 --> 17:39.413
She thought the
verdict was twisted.

17:39.551 --> 17:41.413
Some of the Jurors
were upset, too.

17:42.586 --> 17:45.448
That'’s so upset they couldn'’t
reach you before the verdict.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.448
Good point.

17:49.482 --> 17:52.137
Did Tracy Campbell ever
appear in front you?

17:52.310 --> 17:53.172
All the time.

17:54.172 --> 17:56.689
I have to say I have
trouble believing

17:56.827 --> 17:58.379
She did that intentionally.

17:59.241 --> 18:01.482
Big, thing, though, to
put up an investigation.

18:01.827 --> 18:03.172
It'’s so time-consuming.

18:03.793 --> 18:07.551
9 for 1, focusing on
new cases, thought.

18:07.758 --> 18:09.068
I'’ll drink to that.

18:13.482 --> 18:14.862
But I got the bear.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.724
That'’s the first
time when I knew

18:16.862 --> 18:17.862
She would be a good lawyer

18:18.000 --> 18:19.344
because she was poor.

18:20.827 --> 18:23.413
This is the sample for Mr.
Thomson and Mrs. Bantam.

18:23.551 --> 18:24.689
Ah, nice!

18:25.000 --> 18:26.517
I'’ll be honored to
cater their wedding.

18:26.655 --> 18:27.724
You are engaged?

18:28.172 --> 18:29.206
How wonderful!

18:29.862 --> 18:31.827
We are very excited. Thank you.

18:32.172 --> 18:34.379
But we couldn'’t be
thrilled, right, Gwen?

18:34.896 --> 18:36.137
Bennet and Alison?

18:38.655 --> 18:39.517
Cheers!

18:51.586 --> 18:53.000
I know you'’d be back.

19:03.827 --> 19:05.379
What kind of heroin did you buy?

19:05.517 --> 19:07.310
It was called "“Cop Killer"”.

19:07.482 --> 19:08.793
And do you see the man

19:08.931 --> 19:10.206
Who sold you the heroin
in the court room?

19:10.827 --> 19:12.827
Right there. In the blue blazer.

19:13.275 --> 19:14.000
Thank you.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.896
That will be all.

19:21.517 --> 19:24.241
The mock money
you supposedly handed over...

19:24.379 --> 19:26.137
- I did hand over.
- You claim you handed over.

19:26.275 --> 19:27.517
I did hand it over.

19:27.655 --> 19:29.137
Well, you don'’t have
independent proof

19:29.275 --> 19:30.586
whether the serial numbers
were recorded beforehand,

19:30.724 --> 19:31.793
do you, yes or no?

19:31.931 --> 19:32.965
Yes.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.689
I had to testimony it
to Sergeant Gilford.

19:34.827 --> 19:37.172
Who never documented
recording serial numbers.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.344
If we had, you'’d say we
didn'’t do it on video.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.931
If we did it on video

19:41.068 --> 19:42.103
you'’d say we didn'’t have
a clock on the video.

19:42.241 --> 19:43.896
If we had a clock on the video--

19:44.034 --> 19:47.275
- I'’m asking the questions.
- Objection, let the man finish.

19:47.413 --> 19:49.896
Officer, would you
like to finish?

19:51.551 --> 19:53.034
We don'’t use cameras

19:53.172 --> 19:55.000
because ware buying real drugs
from dangerous people.

19:55.482 --> 19:56.689
We used a secured line

19:56.827 --> 19:59.137
because if people find
what we are doing

19:59.793 --> 20:01.137
good cops get killed.

20:01.275 --> 20:03.000
I didn'’t ask about
the danger, officer.

20:03.310 --> 20:05.827
I asked whether you
have any real evidence

20:05.965 --> 20:08.793
or you are just saying,
"“trust me"” to this Jury.

20:08.931 --> 20:10.068
What I'’ve got is this.

20:10.448 --> 20:12.241
That'’s the guy
who sold me the heroin.

20:12.862 --> 20:13.827
Look, I get it.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.655
No matter what I bring in

20:15.793 --> 20:17.379
you are gonna find a way
to say it'’s not trustworthy.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.000
I understand that,
it'’s your job.

20:19.758 --> 20:21.551
But that don'’t mean your man...

20:22.517 --> 20:23.551
Ain'’t a drug dealer.

20:35.413 --> 20:38.413
- How did it go last night?
- Alison is such a bitch.

20:38.965 --> 20:40.379
And by "“bitch"”, I mean smart.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.310
And Bennet likes it like a damn.

20:42.482 --> 20:44.137
Honestly,
I cannot even blame Bennet.

20:44.275 --> 20:45.206
She is the truth.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.862
Oh my God. You need the V-thing.

20:48.586 --> 20:49.931
Is that the biological thing?

20:50.068 --> 20:54.655
Yes, like a throne thing
goes into your lady part.

20:54.793 --> 20:56.068
It balances your hormones.

20:56.241 --> 20:57.413
It gets your
depression released.

20:57.551 --> 20:58.758
And it will help you get Bennet.

20:58.931 --> 20:59.862
I read about it on Goop.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.103
But it has been posted for long.

21:01.241 --> 21:03.620
Poor girl, so you need a--

21:05.689 --> 21:07.000
Are you kidding me?

21:12.931 --> 21:14.896
Seriously, Jordan,
you got picked up again?

21:15.034 --> 21:16.689
I thought I told you
to put an ice pack on it.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.206
I'’m sorry. I'’m not your client.

21:19.172 --> 21:20.655
Please, you are one of the
most distinctive dudes

21:20.793 --> 21:21.931
I'’ve ever met.

21:22.206 --> 21:24.310
I'’m not Jordan.
I am his twin, Gordan.

21:25.758 --> 21:27.793
You stay right here.
You stay right here.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.068
Can I see the paper
for that guy, please?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.241
Oh man, is that
Jordan or Gordan?

21:33.379 --> 21:34.344
Because I never can tell.

21:36.172 --> 21:37.137
Excuse me,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.620
you were talking to my client?

21:41.068 --> 21:42.586
Can we step outside
for a minute?

21:46.620 --> 21:47.896
They are offering him a year.

21:48.034 --> 21:49.655
We tried to get our
client take 90 days.

21:49.793 --> 21:50.862
They offered you 90 days?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Damn! I would have taken that.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.482
Oh my God! Seriously?

21:59.034 --> 22:00.206
Oh, come on.

22:01.344 --> 22:03.000
I can'’t believe they
are both rubbers.

22:03.137 --> 22:04.310
What are the chances-—

22:07.137 --> 22:09.344
Let'’s join forces.
I have an idea.

22:15.965 --> 22:16.965
Are you in my office?

22:17.206 --> 22:18.482
It'’s kind of nice in here.

22:18.793 --> 22:19.793
Comfortable.

22:20.068 --> 22:21.689
- Good for...
- Nah. Not gonna happen.

22:22.206 --> 22:23.551
That'’s not
what you said last night.

22:23.689 --> 22:25.448
Why are you staying
in a messy closet?

22:26.034 --> 22:27.482
Just trying to get
my mind together.

22:27.896 --> 22:29.827
You were always in here.
I thought it might help.

22:30.965 --> 22:33.137
Don'’t tell me
Charles is nervous.

22:42.758 --> 22:43.896
I might have messed up.

22:44.517 --> 22:46.586
I got demolished
by the undercover.

22:47.448 --> 22:48.724
I should have listened to you

22:48.931 --> 22:50.310
and put him in a drug program.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.172
Please, my body is in tempo.

22:56.413 --> 22:58.275
I pumped my ass, tell
Sean to get to me.

22:58.413 --> 23:00.827
Now, I might have blown it.

23:04.206 --> 23:05.517
I had a hooker client once.

23:06.137 --> 23:08.275
She got hit with
promoting prostitution.

23:09.413 --> 23:10.827
I was so armed.

23:11.448 --> 23:13.068
I just knew I could
get the charges drop

23:13.206 --> 23:14.620
Because the cop didn'’t
get her picture

23:14.758 --> 23:16.275
When he got a blow job from her.

23:17.448 --> 23:18.586
The pack fired.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.137
She ended up getting two years.

23:24.517 --> 23:27.103
- You know what really sucks?
- What?

23:27.965 --> 23:29.000
We go home,

23:30.103 --> 23:31.448
they go to prison.

23:33.896 --> 23:34.827
You want my advice?

23:35.241 --> 23:37.586
Why else why I was
in this damn closet?

23:38.344 --> 23:39.275
Go to Sean.

23:39.689 --> 23:43.965
Put aside your gigantic,
humongous, evil ego.

23:44.586 --> 23:47.620
- Swallow your pride--
- No, no way.

23:48.172 --> 23:50.206
I lay down before Sean,
now He will own me.

23:50.344 --> 23:51.965
I'’ll be his bitch forever.

23:52.655 --> 23:54.620
It means no leverage
for any future clients.

23:54.758 --> 23:56.620
PD 101. You fight
for your clients

23:56.758 --> 23:58.413
As if he is your only client.

23:58.586 --> 24:00.482
Street 101. Do bite your ass.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.275
He will always bite your ass.

24:02.413 --> 24:04.034
You are not
on the street anymore.

24:04.172 --> 24:06.551
You seriously think I should
just bend over in front of Sean.

24:06.689 --> 24:08.103
I think that you are man enough

24:08.413 --> 24:11.000
Not let your client suffer
from your arrogance.

24:11.344 --> 24:12.965
Despite a learning
moment for you.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.172
And mostly,

24:14.655 --> 24:16.724
I think not everything
between you and Sean

24:16.862 --> 24:19.206
Has to have homo tones.

24:26.827 --> 24:28.068
Excuse me, Miss Sullivan.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.620
James Marks.

24:29.931 --> 24:31.586
The office sent me
for your brother, David.

24:31.724 --> 24:32.931
Is there something wrong?

24:33.068 --> 24:34.827
Your father,
he declined a service

24:34.965 --> 24:36.379
of approved residence
from David.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.172
David suggest I contact you.

24:38.724 --> 24:40.413
Apparently, there'’s sort
of miscommunication

24:40.551 --> 24:41.413
Between my father and me.

24:41.551 --> 24:43.206
Can we get back to you?

24:43.344 --> 24:44.655
We can'’t help your brother
without an approved residence.

24:45.448 --> 24:46.862
We'’ll wait for your call.

24:54.758 --> 24:56.448
Dad, I just got ambush by
an officer on the road.

24:56.586 --> 24:57.862
Did you change your
mind about David?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.689
What'’s going on? Call me back.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.103
Sean!

25:04.827 --> 25:07.413
Oh, waiting for another
round, big time!

25:07.586 --> 25:08.620
Can'’t we talk some sense?

25:08.758 --> 25:11.241
Oh, I also thought so.

25:12.172 --> 25:15.724
I may have allowed our prior
history clawed my judgment.

25:16.655 --> 25:19.103
Make me a reasonable offer.
I will take it to my client.

25:19.931 --> 25:21.172
Only if you tell me how it feels

25:21.310 --> 25:23.413
When you have
a pathetic adequacy.

25:26.517 --> 25:27.241
All right.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.310
Let'’s see, the maximum was 15.

25:30.448 --> 25:31.862
I offered the Jury 11 before.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.793
If you ask me really
nicely, I can give him 14.

25:39.379 --> 25:40.344
Ask me,

25:41.137 --> 25:42.275
really nicely.

25:45.206 --> 25:45.896
Okay.

25:47.586 --> 25:48.413
Please.

25:49.241 --> 25:54.551
Really nicely humbly asking
for the sake of my client

25:55.724 --> 25:57.724
For you to kiss my ass.

26:00.275 --> 26:02.000
Call your next witness.

26:09.275 --> 26:10.413
Try to relax.

26:16.965 --> 26:18.344
Relax body.

26:18.482 --> 26:22.758
Send your Virginia
right over the steam.

26:25.689 --> 26:26.827
Hey, hey, hey!

26:26.965 --> 26:29.241
You have to just
let it get up here.

26:29.896 --> 26:32.931
The hot water
has solvia, rosemary

26:33.068 --> 26:35.206
Oregon, wood...

26:35.586 --> 26:39.310
Very good for deoxidation
of the uterus.

26:39.862 --> 26:42.310
I'’m sorry. Is she trying
to say my cuchi is toxic?

26:43.068 --> 26:44.448
20 minutes.

26:58.896 --> 27:01.137
How come Tracy doesn'’t like me?

27:02.344 --> 27:05.068
Well, I have to guess.
And this is her, not me.

27:05.689 --> 27:07.068
She thinks you are too soft.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.206
Too entitled, too naive.

27:10.068 --> 27:11.172
And your hair...

27:11.413 --> 27:12.689
She said something
about my hair?

27:12.827 --> 27:14.068
No, that was mean, girl.

27:14.586 --> 27:16.827
You don'’t look like a black
like a real one in the hood.

27:16.965 --> 27:18.103
Is this supposed to itch?
Because it did.

27:18.241 --> 27:19.586
Just the steam doing its job.

27:19.724 --> 27:22.206
No, this really is itchy.
Excuse me, SPA lady?

27:22.620 --> 27:24.310
Hello, mam!

27:24.448 --> 27:26.000
Hi! Could you...? There is a...

27:26.137 --> 27:29.413
A certain amount of itching
irritation happening here.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.931
Possible you are
allergic to herbs?

27:33.103 --> 27:35.172
Tell me you didn'’t say sage.
Is there sage in here?

27:35.310 --> 27:36.758
That is another word for "“sage"”.

27:36.896 --> 27:39.275
No, no, no.
I am allergic to that!

27:39.413 --> 27:40.689
You have to say that.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.206
You have to say English
word for stuff.

27:42.344 --> 27:44.068
- I'’m sorry.
- I'’m allergenic to sage.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.206
You can'’t do that.

27:45.344 --> 27:47.862
That'’s why... Oh my God!

27:54.758 --> 27:56.103
Talked to Hernandez.

27:56.896 --> 27:58.551
Thank me for saving your ass.

27:58.689 --> 28:02.068
I didn'’t ask for savior,
just occasional hook-up.

28:04.275 --> 28:05.482
Jesus, Tracy!

28:07.275 --> 28:08.689
You came this close

28:08.827 --> 28:11.034
To be referred to DA Office
for an investigation.

28:11.172 --> 28:12.482
It could have ended your career.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.379
It was all just blown
out of proportion.

28:15.448 --> 28:17.000
You can'’t admit
what you did, can you?

28:17.137 --> 28:18.310
Admit what exactly?

28:18.448 --> 28:19.586
I saw you.

28:20.517 --> 28:21.413
I was there.

28:21.551 --> 28:22.896
You were temping with a Jury.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.000
What you saw was me
saving an innocent man

28:25.137 --> 28:27.689
From an unjustified
conviction shut up his ass.

28:27.862 --> 28:29.793
It was unethical and illegal.

28:29.931 --> 28:31.758
Said a man that
cheats on his wife.

28:31.896 --> 28:33.517
That'’s not the same thing.

28:34.068 --> 28:34.827
What I did.

28:35.551 --> 28:37.724
It might be illegal,
but it'’s not immoral.

28:37.862 --> 28:39.172
Whereas you screwing me,

28:39.310 --> 28:40.620
it might be technically illegal

28:40.758 --> 28:43.241
But it'’s immoral
and wildly unethical.

28:43.379 --> 28:45.586
So why don'’t you
spare the lecture?

28:55.965 --> 28:57.310
I presume that the Defense

28:57.448 --> 28:59.206
Stipulating to the
chemist'’s testimony?

28:59.344 --> 29:00.724
Actually no, Your Honor.

29:00.862 --> 29:02.068
Oh, come on!

29:02.206 --> 29:03.862
Mr. Riggs, are you
seriously forcing him

29:04.000 --> 29:05.206
To put the chemist on the stand?

29:05.344 --> 29:06.517
Because if you are

29:06.827 --> 29:09.827
I have too many cases for
you to engage exercise.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.758
The law says Prosecution
has to prove

29:11.896 --> 29:13.689
Every element
of the defense charged.

29:13.896 --> 29:15.068
They said the stuff was heroin.

29:15.206 --> 29:16.517
Let him put on
the chemist to prove it.

29:16.793 --> 29:17.793
This is against the game.

29:17.931 --> 29:19.482
The Defense is trying to stall.

29:19.620 --> 29:20.931
Is there any real chance

29:21.068 --> 29:23.137
the substance in this case
was not heroin?

29:23.275 --> 29:24.827
I don'’t know. Not my burden.

29:25.206 --> 29:27.172
You say you can prove
the case, prove it.

29:27.344 --> 29:28.172
Call the witness.

29:29.551 --> 29:31.448
You'’ve been a chemist
for how long?

29:31.620 --> 29:32.517
Nine years.

29:33.241 --> 29:36.379
So you are pretty good
at recognizing heroin.

29:36.689 --> 29:38.275
I'’m familiar with it, I guess.

29:38.413 --> 29:40.482
But even I'’m most positive
that something is heroin

29:40.620 --> 29:41.448
I still test it.

29:41.586 --> 29:42.275
Right,

29:42.862 --> 29:45.172
can you explain
what you do to it?

29:45.758 --> 29:47.000
Before I testify,

29:47.137 --> 29:48.655
I do a serious of tests

29:48.793 --> 29:51.793
To prove the substance is
a prohibiting narcotic.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.931
You do tests
to confirm your suspicion.

29:56.655 --> 29:57.448
As I said.

29:57.655 --> 29:59.172
Because as a scientist,

29:59.310 --> 30:01.965
you never accept Someone takes
your word for something

30:02.103 --> 30:03.517
if you haven'’t shown your work.

30:03.655 --> 30:04.689
Of course not.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.068
How many tests do you
do on a substance

30:07.206 --> 30:08.862
Before declaring it
to be heroin?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.413
Five in total.

30:10.551 --> 30:13.655
Three reagent tests
Micro test, and a GC confirm.

30:13.793 --> 30:15.310
And you document each one?

30:15.482 --> 30:16.275
Yes.

30:16.517 --> 30:18.068
We keep contemporaneous records.

30:18.655 --> 30:19.620
How would we know?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.620
Is there a way
to verify your claim?

30:21.758 --> 30:23.655
The computer time
stamps everything.

30:23.793 --> 30:25.241
We dictate our notes as we go.

30:25.379 --> 30:26.758
We always show our work.

30:26.896 --> 30:29.137
We test the substance before
we testify to something.

30:29.275 --> 30:31.172
Because you'’d never
just come to the court

30:31.310 --> 30:33.241
And say, "“trust me,
I am a scientist"”.

30:33.379 --> 30:35.482
You never expect the Jury
to take your word on something

30:35.620 --> 30:38.379
If you hadn'’t showed
your work, would you?

30:38.517 --> 30:40.241
No, I wouldn'’t.

30:42.068 --> 30:43.241
Impressive.

30:44.103 --> 30:47.241
Thank you for bringing
us real evidence.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.620
- What'’s wrong?
- Nothing.

31:04.758 --> 31:06.068
So, what happened last night?

31:06.965 --> 31:09.344
It was painful.
A sore after the man.

31:09.551 --> 31:10.517
And I slept with Charlie.

31:10.655 --> 31:12.517
Wait, you slept with Charlie?

31:13.172 --> 31:14.137
I thought you like Bennet.

31:14.275 --> 31:15.517
Yeah, so did I.

31:16.517 --> 31:18.758
Wait, why do I smell
rosemary and oregano?

31:18.896 --> 31:21.655
Because Venessa
took me to get a vesting.

31:21.793 --> 31:23.068
And broke my virgoinx.

31:23.206 --> 31:25.793
Christ on a cracker!
I'’m so confused.

31:25.931 --> 31:29.689
I took her for a SPA
treatment to cleanser her.

31:30.344 --> 31:32.137
Why wasn'’t I invited
to the cuchi cleanser?

31:32.275 --> 31:34.103
Tracy we were sitting on a box

31:34.241 --> 31:36.827
With muds and steaming
up to our lady parts.

31:36.965 --> 31:38.241
I made an executive
decision that

31:38.379 --> 31:39.862
You and your cuchi
would not have fun.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.275
- Good decision.
- You are welcome.

31:41.413 --> 31:42.172
Thank you.

31:42.689 --> 31:44.000
I don'’t understand
the plan here.

31:44.655 --> 31:46.965
Why are we working so hard
for these rubbing twins?

31:47.103 --> 31:48.310
Of course, you don'’t.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.793
Shouldn'’t they do
some jail time.

31:49.931 --> 31:50.896
For rubbing against
women on the subway?

31:51.034 --> 31:52.310
I don'’t know, Venessa.

31:52.448 --> 31:53.655
Should we lock up a bulk
of alcoholics, too?

31:53.793 --> 31:55.103
Hey, Jordan, it'’s Gwen.

31:55.241 --> 31:57.137
I need you to round up
Gordan and call me back.

31:57.275 --> 31:59.344
We need a brutally
honest conversation.

31:59.482 --> 32:00.862
About your sexual proclivities.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.689
And we need to do some shopping.

32:02.862 --> 32:03.793
Bye.

32:04.068 --> 32:06.000
I need you
to put on a pant suit.

32:07.517 --> 32:08.206
Hey,

32:09.586 --> 32:10.655
why do I smell

32:12.000 --> 32:14.034
the weeds growing
in the empty yard

32:14.172 --> 32:16.103
I was playing baseball
in it when I was a kid?

32:27.137 --> 32:29.413
- I called you three times.
- Come in.

32:29.551 --> 32:31.896
Most daughters when they
see their father calling--

32:32.034 --> 32:33.758
Most fathers would
take their sons

32:33.896 --> 32:35.241
After they
have been incarcerated.

32:35.379 --> 32:36.586
What happened, Dad?

32:36.724 --> 32:38.482
You need to get
yourself some groceries.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.724
And for God'’s sake, you need to
leave that flame bottle alone

32:40.862 --> 32:42.344
That stuff will kill you.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.172
Dad, did you come in to
talk to me about groceries?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.965
I thought that
I could make peace

32:53.103 --> 32:55.758
with David'’s actions
in his circumstance,

32:55.896 --> 32:57.000
but I cannot.

32:57.241 --> 32:59.103
I gave two of you
the best of everything.

32:59.241 --> 33:00.827
Clearly, that'’s not enough.

33:01.206 --> 33:02.344
There'’s nothing else

33:02.482 --> 33:04.034
I am willing to give
to your brother.

33:04.172 --> 33:05.517
How am I supposed
to take him in?

33:05.655 --> 33:08.379
He is not your
responsibility, either.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.931
You need to focus on yourself.
Make better choices.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.137
I might be old,
but I am not blind.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.896
I saw that you have
feelings for Bennet.

33:18.275 --> 33:19.448
So did Alison.

33:20.517 --> 33:22.000
You need to find your own man.

33:22.137 --> 33:24.068
Dad, decent black men
are hard to come by.

33:24.206 --> 33:25.379
That'’s an excuse.

33:26.275 --> 33:28.448
You spent all of your
time with your clients.

33:29.034 --> 33:31.034
You haven'’t got time
to getting out.

33:32.068 --> 33:33.310
That'’s no way to live.

33:33.758 --> 33:34.862
That is no way...

33:37.965 --> 33:39.793
That'’s no way for my
daughter to live.

33:40.206 --> 33:42.517
Quit job, abandon brother,
find love. Got it!

33:42.655 --> 33:45.034
Thanks, Dad!
Terrific advice!

33:56.310 --> 33:57.586
How old were you

33:57.724 --> 33:59.862
when you start getting
the urge to rub on woman?

34:00.172 --> 34:01.551
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

34:02.724 --> 34:05.310
Do you have a preferred
venue for your activity?

34:06.068 --> 34:08.103
- I prefer the subway.
- The subway.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.241
Do you like blonds, brunettes?

34:10.620 --> 34:13.206
Dark brunettes, we both do.

34:13.758 --> 34:14.793
Oh, come on.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.551
How about woman in pants suits?

34:19.689 --> 34:21.068
Yeah, I kind of seek
for pants suits.

34:21.206 --> 34:24.896
Me, too, and I like women
with clear waists.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.517
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

34:26.655 --> 34:28.344
Your Honor,
this is ridiculous.

34:28.482 --> 34:30.413
Counselor, what'’s your point?

34:30.551 --> 34:31.793
Would you both stand up?

34:39.413 --> 34:40.551
Your Honor,

34:40.689 --> 34:42.241
both of these men
suffer from frotteurism.

34:42.379 --> 34:44.448
It'’s a recognized
psychiatric disorder.

34:44.586 --> 34:45.862
And it has a genetic component.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.275
I mean, look at them,
they are twins.

34:47.413 --> 34:48.965
And they have the exactly
same puerilities.

34:49.103 --> 34:53.000
They are both "“activated"”
by my college Vanessa.

34:53.137 --> 34:54.586
This is ridiculous.

34:54.724 --> 34:56.413
They are both sexual predators.

34:56.551 --> 34:58.896
The condition'’s apparently
admissible to a treatment.

34:59.068 --> 35:01.103
There is a residential program
that could help them.

35:01.241 --> 35:03.413
Yeah, it'’s called the
New York Prison System.

35:03.551 --> 35:06.517
You want me to send
serious rubbers

35:07.103 --> 35:08.517
To a rubbing program.

35:08.655 --> 35:11.241
It will be far more likely
to avoid future offences.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.724
And besides, locking them
up for genetic disorder

35:13.862 --> 35:16.413
That'’s like punishing them
for how they were made.

35:16.931 --> 35:19.275
How much a chance can
they control their urges?

35:19.413 --> 35:20.793
Or send them records.

35:20.931 --> 35:22.931
- They will get the message.
- Enough.

35:23.551 --> 35:24.413
Sit down.

35:27.206 --> 35:31.206
Counselors, men like these are
discourages of the subway.

35:32.724 --> 35:33.827
But I also have conscious

35:33.965 --> 35:36.206
of the limits of
our prison system.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.172
Let'’s hope this program works.

35:40.310 --> 35:42.793
Because if it doesn'’t,
you are both going to jail.

35:47.965 --> 35:49.724
There was a time when
a police officer

35:49.862 --> 35:53.413
walked in a court room
and deserved credibility.

35:54.448 --> 35:57.413
In the days of antimir arise

35:57.862 --> 35:59.689
When the people
can online stream

35:59.827 --> 36:02.137
Cops getting down
children on Facebook

36:02.965 --> 36:05.655
When the screams of
"“I can'’t breathe!"”

36:05.793 --> 36:08.413
Can still echoing in the air.

36:10.482 --> 36:13.862
Police just don'’t deserve
that special treatment anymore.

36:14.827 --> 36:17.068
Michael Brown, Freddy Gray

36:17.344 --> 36:19.241
and a thousand of the names.

36:19.379 --> 36:20.827
Proved beyond any doubt

36:20.965 --> 36:24.241
that the word of an officer
can no longer justify

36:24.379 --> 36:25.862
to give away a man'’s life

36:26.241 --> 36:28.103
to the criminal justice system.

36:29.068 --> 36:30.137
Only the chemist

36:30.689 --> 36:33.379
showed up in this case
with real evidence.

36:33.931 --> 36:35.241
Everything else

36:36.137 --> 36:37.275
was just a whole bunch of cops.

36:37.413 --> 36:39.310
Saying because I said so.

36:40.310 --> 36:42.931
They had no proof they wrote
down the serial number

36:43.068 --> 36:44.482
before they found the money.

36:44.620 --> 36:47.793
They had no proof they ever
radioed the description.

36:49.413 --> 36:52.517
Cause "“I said so"” is not enough.

36:53.517 --> 36:55.000
And if it'’s not enough

36:56.206 --> 36:59.620
you cannot possibly
find this man guilty.

37:03.344 --> 37:04.206
Thank you.

37:11.068 --> 37:12.896
The defense lawyer talked
about the antimir arises

37:13.034 --> 37:17.137
as if there is anything to
do this man a drug dealer.

37:18.482 --> 37:21.068
His argument preys
on your ignorance.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.724
He bet on your inability
to tell the difference

37:23.862 --> 37:26.482
Between a bad shooting
and a good evidence.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.482
In this case, the undercover
bought drugs from Mike.

37:31.344 --> 37:32.344
He identified him.

37:32.827 --> 37:34.137
And when they arrested him

37:34.275 --> 37:36.034
They found the buy money
and the drugs on him.

37:36.172 --> 37:37.482
It'’s that simple.

37:38.310 --> 37:40.103
You are angry about Garden.

37:40.551 --> 37:42.103
I am, too. But you do not

37:42.241 --> 37:43.931
let a guilty drug dealer walk

37:44.068 --> 37:46.655
Because a crafty defense
lawyer got you around

37:46.793 --> 37:48.655
about the police impartiality.

37:48.793 --> 37:50.517
No.

37:50.655 --> 37:52.000
You are smarter than that.

38:02.379 --> 38:04.793
On more round,
drinks on me.

38:04.931 --> 38:06.448
Tabs pretty high already, Gwen.

38:06.586 --> 38:09.241
Listen, honey, one more
round of drink on Vanessa.

38:09.379 --> 38:10.724
All right, all right.

38:11.344 --> 38:12.275
Hey,

38:12.586 --> 38:15.172
hey, that guy
at the end of bar there.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.103
- The cute, With the bow tie.
- Who?

38:18.344 --> 38:20.344
No, no, no, no.

38:20.586 --> 38:23.310
That's the crips and bloods.
He's forbidden fruit.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.551
Seriously? There is no
super-hot exception?

38:25.689 --> 38:28.310
Listen to me he is the enemy.

38:28.448 --> 38:31.724
Vanessa, how was your day
of sexual deviance?

38:31.931 --> 38:33.724
Well, I'’ve never in
my wildest dreams

38:33.862 --> 38:37.413
would I've imagine I feel good
about getting a rubber off.

38:38.655 --> 38:40.655
I got it. They obviously
have compulsion.

38:40.793 --> 38:42.379
They can'’t help themselves.

38:42.517 --> 38:44.482
The question is whether you can
feel good walking a client

38:44.620 --> 38:45.793
if he could help it.

38:46.482 --> 38:47.931
Who wins the honorable case?

38:48.068 --> 38:51.344
- What'’s my name?
- Ah! Impressive!

38:51.482 --> 38:53.000
Not to rain on your parade,

38:53.137 --> 38:55.620
but Vanessa and I got
the rubber twins, wait for it,

38:55.758 --> 38:57.482
into a program!

38:58.344 --> 39:00.103
You got a program
for Harvey and Pervy?

39:00.241 --> 39:01.517
What's our names?

39:01.827 --> 39:04.275
In honor of your minor
accomplishment

39:04.413 --> 39:05.482
drinks on me.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.172
Except you never
carry your wallet.

39:07.310 --> 39:08.827
And mess up the line of this
suit? Please!

39:08.965 --> 39:10.965
No, no, no, no. Not this time.

39:11.103 --> 39:12.758
You be a gentleman
and you pony up.

39:12.896 --> 39:15.000
- I'’m gonna get my wallet.
- Thank you.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.000
Step away from the vehicle.

39:41.482 --> 39:43.586
I said, step away
the vehicle!

39:43.965 --> 39:45.827
Since when I am against
the law to admire a car?

39:45.965 --> 39:47.103
Put your hands in the air.

39:47.241 --> 39:49.000
- Do it!
- It's here and now.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.551
Are you kidding me?
Come on, bro.

39:51.689 --> 39:53.275
Don't look at him.
You're dealing with me.

39:53.413 --> 39:54.620
Just relax, man.

39:55.172 --> 39:56.482
You need to learn to do
as you're told.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.137
I didn'’t do nothing, man.

39:58.275 --> 40:00.034
I didn'’t do anything,
get off me!

40:01.103 --> 40:02.689
I didn'’t do anything.

40:03.758 --> 40:05.206
That'’s for talking back.

40:05.793 --> 40:07.931
You are under arrest for
obstructing a police officer.

40:08.068 --> 40:09.965
Disorder and conduct,
resisting arrest.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.965
Bullshit! You can'’t do this!

40:14.655 --> 40:15.896
Watch your head.

40:18.448 --> 40:19.862
I want to know what I did.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.310
What code did I break?

40:24.241 --> 40:25.689
What law did I break
right here?

40:25.827 --> 40:27.724
Other than looking
at a damn car...

40:36.275 --> 40:37.931
Next time on In Contempt...

40:38.068 --> 40:39.034
Press down.

40:39.172 --> 40:40.620
You did it nice and black.

40:40.758 --> 40:43.206
You can't do a stripsearch.
I'’m a lawyer.

40:43.344 --> 40:46.413
And my son is a black boy
in America

40:46.551 --> 40:48.793
born with two strikes
against him.

40:48.931 --> 40:51.241
The Defense respectfully
moves you recuse yourself.

40:51.379 --> 40:52.241
On what grounds?

40:52.379 --> 40:53.793
You've never lived in the hood--

40:53.931 --> 40:56.965
You have no idea
what I know or don'’t know, Gwen.

40:57.103 --> 40:58.724
Post-bail, a plea-guilty.

40:58.862 --> 41:01.068
- I get cases to move here.
- No, wait! I will lose my job.

41:01.206 --> 41:03.034
I work for the money,
I work for the man.

41:03.172 --> 41:07.827
I do my job. Because nobody
gives a damn about black people.
