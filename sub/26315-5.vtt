WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:06.310
[groans]

00:06.354 --> 00:07.746
What are you doing?

00:07.790 --> 00:09.444
Waiting for the bathroom.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.923
Tammy's taken it hostage.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.751
Just go use the one upstairs.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.363
Good idea. I'll just
hop in the elevator.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.886
Sorry, but isn't it great

00:16.929 --> 00:18.540
I don't even see the chair
anymore?

00:18.583 --> 00:21.282
Yeah, you're the best.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.068
How you doing in there, Tammy?

00:25.112 --> 00:26.635
Wrapping it up, boss.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.811
Just scraping the
jail out of my feet.

00:28.854 --> 00:32.641
Oh, I got to scrape that image
out of my mind.

00:32.684 --> 00:35.252
Keep looking. Maybe food
will magically appear.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.908
Tammy even polished off
the mystery Tupperware.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.736
We should ask her
what the hell was in there.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.651
Mac and cheese.I still say chicken.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.914
Maybe.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.437
Hey, guys,
I think we need

00:46.481 --> 00:48.178
to set some time
limits on the bathroom.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.659
Ah, give her break. This is
the first time in seven years

00:50.702 --> 00:53.227
she's been able to take a shower
that didn't turn into a date.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.578
Hey, Adam, thanks again
for tomorrow.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.449
Mm.We are gonna have a blast.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.495
I know. I can't wait.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.714
He doesn't know what I'm
talking about, does he?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.368
Not a clue.

01:04.412 --> 01:07.980
San Francisco, tickets
to Wicked,graduation gift

01:08.024 --> 01:10.679
for the little scamp.You never told me that.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.289
Oh, please. It was right there
on your Visa bill.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.204
But I hate plays.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.945
This isn't a play.
It's a musical.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.773
You're rowing
in the wrong direction.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.818
Look, come on, Adam.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.994
It's about the
Wizard of Oz.
It'll be great.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.692
So a musical about a musical?

01:23.735 --> 01:26.129
Why, that changes everything.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.175
What do you want to do
with the extra ticket?

01:28.218 --> 01:30.177
How about Marjorie?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.527
Eh... It's a long drive.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.442
How about Tammy?

01:34.485 --> 01:36.183
Tammy yells at the TV.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.010
What's she gonna do when there's
flying monkeys coming at her?

01:38.054 --> 01:40.056
Jill?In the nosebleed seats?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.579
She'll jump to her death.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.754
Oh.
Wendy?

01:42.798 --> 01:45.148
Oh, come on. Be serious.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.716
Well, we're out of friends,
so we're back to Marjorie.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.022
And she could use a break.
Since Victor's stroke,

01:50.066 --> 01:52.199
her whole life has been
taking care of him.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.678
How's he doing anyway?

01:53.722 --> 01:55.202
Pretty much the same.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.639
Super sad. Hey,
why don't we scalp the ticket?

01:59.902 --> 02:01.860
What? I said, "Super sad."

02:01.904 --> 02:03.427
I'm calling Marjorie.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.950
Fine.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.735
You dodged this bullet,

02:06.778 --> 02:08.519
but you're still taking me
to see Chernext month.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.304
Cher?!

02:10.347 --> 02:12.871
What is happening?

02:12.915 --> 02:14.699
You really need to start looking
at your Visa bill.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.921
â™ª

02:42.031 --> 02:45.904
Wow. We are
way up here.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.994
I hope we can tell
which witch is which.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.692
Thank God Adam didn't come.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.390
I completely forgot
to get him a handicap seat.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.959
We would've had to pass him
down the row like a hot dog.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.743
Well, I don't care
where we're sitting.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.484
I have been dying
to see this show.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.269
I know every song
by heart.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.706
But we're gonna let the actors
sing 'em, right?

03:04.749 --> 03:07.056
Sure, they can join in.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.626
Switch with me, now.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.671
[cellophane crinkling noisily]

03:17.806 --> 03:21.462
[applause and cheering,
whooping]

03:21.505 --> 03:24.465
Oh, my God, she was
flying andsinging.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.031
Isn't this amazing?

03:26.075 --> 03:27.729
She didn't choose
to be wicked.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.296
It was thrust
upon her!

03:29.339 --> 03:31.254
I know.
Now I understand youbetter!

03:31.298 --> 03:33.430
So do I.

03:33.474 --> 03:36.346
Thank you both so much.
I'm having the best time.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.130
And you weren't lying.
You doknow every word.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.263
Uh-huh.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.265
Can I see your
bag of candy?
Oh.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.701
Help yourself.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.182
You'll get this back
at the end of the show.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.795
I fixed it, lady, so
you can stop sighing.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.667
I think I've got go
to the bathroom,

03:52.710 --> 03:54.799
but I know the line's
gonna be way too long.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.279
Just use the men's room.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.846
It's San Francisco.
No one's gonna ask.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.717
Oh, my God.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.285
Victor's had
another stroke.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.591
Oh, no.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.070
We got to go.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.595
Of course.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.249
Yeah, we should all go.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.471
Has anybody heard
from Marjorie?

04:14.515 --> 04:16.778
Went by this morning,
and she didn't answer the door.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.215
If your husband just died,
would you want to talk?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.870
Poor woman was by his side
every minute, month after month,

04:21.913 --> 04:23.872
and the one time
she gets dragged away...

04:23.915 --> 04:27.658
Got it, Mom. I killed Victor
by taking her to a musical.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.792
I can't stop thinking
about Victor.

04:30.835 --> 04:34.099
He was ripped from us too soon!
[cries]

04:34.143 --> 04:35.840
Did she even know Victor?

04:35.884 --> 04:37.668
She barely
knows Marjorie.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.758
Till a week ago,
she was calling her "Marsha."

04:40.802 --> 04:44.327
I'm sorry. I just shoved my
feelings down in the slammer.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.982
Now they're just
shooting out of me.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.593
So people in prison
actually say "slammer"?

04:49.637 --> 04:51.378
You makin' fun of my words?

04:51.421 --> 04:54.032
No, sir, I am not.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.036
Hey, ladies.
Hey.
Hey.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.388
Guess who got a parking space
right out front.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.651
You're here.I'm so sorry.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.348
Oh, yeah.How you doing?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.611
Oh, thank you. I'm okay.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.613
I dropped by earlier.
Where were you?

05:09.657 --> 05:12.094
Ah, well, I had to buy the
cookies, and on the way home,

05:12.137 --> 05:14.226
I saw the cutest sweater
in a store window,

05:14.270 --> 05:15.793
and what do you think?

05:17.795 --> 05:20.407
You went shopping?Well, it was more
of an impulse buy.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.713
I didn't think you'd
be going out today.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.106
If I had known, I would
have picked you up.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.587
Don't be silly.
I can drive. Yeah.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.153
Ooh, hoo.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.894
You know, you forget
about macaroons,

05:29.938 --> 05:33.202
and then you have one,
and it's, like, wow.

05:35.857 --> 05:40.731
Anybody else think she seems
a little too... not sad?

05:40.775 --> 05:42.385
She's probably still in shock.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.823
Mm, she should be. That
sweater's a swing and a miss.

05:45.867 --> 05:49.349
Everyone grieves
in their own way.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.915
She's not
grieving at all.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.570
She's shopping
and eating and parking.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.399
Some keep it inside,
some let it out.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.880
There's no rulebook
for feelings.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.843
When did booze commercials start
showing up on TV again?

06:05.887 --> 06:08.455
I mean, I'm watching my Hallmark
Christmas movie marathon,

06:08.498 --> 06:10.544
and there's an ad for some kind
of fancy bourbon

06:10.587 --> 06:12.197
that's been tongue-kissed
by the devil.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.027
Suddenly I'm horny,
I want to get drunk,

06:16.071 --> 06:17.725
and I could give a flying fig

06:17.768 --> 06:19.944
if Reba McEntire makes it home
for the holidays.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.990
Thanks.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.907
Would anyone else like
to share?

06:30.607 --> 06:33.654
Is anyone else sure
they don't want share?

06:33.697 --> 06:36.483
If I wanted to share,
I'd raise my hand.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.875
I know how it works.

06:39.703 --> 06:40.922
I could go again.

06:40.965 --> 06:44.012
Maybe this time,
you'll pay attention.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.496
Yesterday, she went mall
jogging, had some Wetzel bits,

06:49.539 --> 06:51.846
and then she bought a colander
at Williams Sonoma.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.891
Are you stalking her?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.937
No, she Instagrammed it.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.808
The pretzels or the colander?

06:57.852 --> 07:00.985
Both. I don't think
she totally gets Instagram.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.206
Or death.

07:04.249 --> 07:08.166
Christy, why don't you let her
get through this in her own way?

07:08.210 --> 07:10.299
Hey, she's the one who told me

07:10.342 --> 07:12.475
if we bury our feelings,
it could lead to a relapse.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.260
It could. And guess what?
You have no control

07:15.304 --> 07:19.047
over someone else's
drinking, so let this go.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.311
Youlet it go.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.879
Does Marjorie have a sponsor?

07:24.922 --> 07:26.968
Yes.Does she work the program?

07:27.011 --> 07:28.491
Yes.Does she have a higher power?

07:28.535 --> 07:29.492
Yes.Is it you?

07:29.536 --> 07:32.626
Yes. I mean, no.

07:32.669 --> 07:35.106
So you gonna let it go?[sighs]

07:35.150 --> 07:37.413
Okay.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.198
Your lips say "okay,"
but those crazy eyes say,

07:40.242 --> 07:43.201
"I'm gonna get under the hood
of this engine and rip it up."

07:43.245 --> 07:44.420
It's that obvious?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.943
How were you ever a gambler

07:45.987 --> 07:47.118
with a poker face like that?

07:47.162 --> 07:49.817
That's not my poker face.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.820
This is my poker face.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.691
It's very effective.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.698
Just leave
the flowers anywhere.

08:01.742 --> 08:05.006
Two hour service
and not one tear.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.399
I thought she was going
for a tissue at one point,

08:07.443 --> 08:09.227
but she just had
a bug in her eye.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.534
It's healthy. She's moving on.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.581
But when I go, I expect you
to throw yourself on the coffin

08:14.624 --> 08:16.539
and curse God
for taking me so young.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.975
Don't worry. When
the time comes,

08:18.019 --> 08:19.977
I've got a whole
performance planned out.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.762
Great.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.328
Wait.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.809
You gave a beautiful eulogy.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.334
So many Victor fun facts.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.424
I mean, who knew
he was an amateur magician?

08:32.468 --> 08:33.817
I did.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.993
We had a long dinner here
one night,

08:36.037 --> 08:37.168
which was lovely.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.564
He made an entire Saturday night
go poof.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.654
Adam, I just remembered.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.351
I have something
I want you to have.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.744
Oh.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.572
I hope it's a beer.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.096
Yeah, she keeps a six-pack
of beer in her bedroom.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.358
WENDY:
I used to keep

08:53.402 --> 08:56.100
a keg and a tank of
nitrous in my bedroom.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.450
Unbelievable.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.148
Don't judge. You
did stuff, too.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.542
I'm talking about Marjorie.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.545
It is odd. She cried more
when her cat died.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.894
Well, I'm officially worried.

09:06.937 --> 09:09.070
The only thing she got upset
about at the funeral

09:09.113 --> 09:12.377
was when those bagpipes started
warming up for the next service.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.771
I think that hit
all of us hard.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.599
These were Victor's.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.122
I thought you might like them.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.037
Oh.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.605
A velour tracksuit?

09:22.649 --> 09:25.956
I have always wanted
one of these.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.351
Now you have six of them.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.309
[chuckles]:
You're too sweet.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.224
Never outside the house.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.969
Got a special place
you want to put the urn?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.929
Maybe by your bedside so you'll
feel like he's there at night?

09:41.972 --> 09:45.106
No. This'll be fine.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.064
Seriously?
Next to the Raisin Bran?

09:47.108 --> 09:49.110
It's only temporary.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.765
Victor wanted his ashes spread
around the apple orchard

09:51.808 --> 09:53.070
where he proposed to me.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.290
Aw, when you gonna do it?

09:55.333 --> 09:58.162
I don't know. It's a long drive.
I'll get to it.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.990
If you'd like, I'll go with you.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.818
I'd like to see where
Victor proposed.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.080
Maybe we can all go.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.953
Yeah, great.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.607
Mom?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.565
I changed my mind.
Never outside...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.175
Just never.

10:11.219 --> 10:15.223
And yes to whatever
you're talking about.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.667
I didn't know Victor
was into Cuban cigars.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.975
I did. Again, epic dinner.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.194
Check it out. Smoke ring.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.764
Nope.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.985
Victor used to smoke one
of these every night.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.335
Aw, Marjorie.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.815
So many memories.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.686
I bet everywhere you look,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.775
you see reminders
of your life together.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.821
Uh-huh.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.173
No more Christmases.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.741
No more
crossword puzzles in bed.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.569
Reel it in.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.833
Why did men get cigars?

10:59.876 --> 11:02.531
I say we take these
and give them Spanx.

11:02.574 --> 11:05.055
Forget Spanx.
Give them mammograms.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.144
Ooh, how about menstrual cramps?

11:07.188 --> 11:10.670
Yeah, or deep rectal spasms.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.501
Why did Victor propose to you
in an orchard?

11:16.545 --> 11:18.503
Actually, it's a
very romantic story.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.985
Ooh, get out the tissues.

11:22.029 --> 11:25.293
We were driving to a bed
and breakfast in Carmel,

11:25.336 --> 11:27.687
and we hit a huge possum.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.820
Got twisted up in the axle,
so we had to pull over.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.953
Boy, it's like
a Harlequin romance.

11:32.996 --> 11:36.260
Anyway, when Victor
reached under the car

11:36.304 --> 11:38.872
to try to yank out what was
left of the poor thing,

11:38.915 --> 11:41.701
the ring fell out
of his jacket.

11:41.744 --> 11:45.748
I was so thrilled, I said
yes before he even asked.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.316
And it all happened

11:48.359 --> 11:50.710
in front
of a lovely apple orchard?

11:50.753 --> 11:53.887
No, that's where we
buried the possum.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.195
When I go, I want to be buried

11:58.239 --> 12:00.284
in my garden with my cats.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.200
You have a garden full
of dead cats?

12:03.244 --> 12:06.638
I've eaten zucchini
from that garden.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.859
Meow.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.731
For the record,
you're not cremating me.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.950
That way when
the zombie apocalypse happens,

12:13.994 --> 12:16.692
I can crawl out of my grave
and eat all your faces.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.131
Anyone else feeling
a little lightheaded?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.962
[Christy retching]

12:28.748 --> 12:31.054
Seriously, who inhales a cigar?

12:31.098 --> 12:34.623
I'm an addict.
I inhale everything.

12:34.666 --> 12:37.669
[retching]

12:40.672 --> 12:42.979
Well, this can't be right.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.807
It has to be.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.809
Is it possible
they built the Costco

12:46.853 --> 12:48.985
around the apple orchard?

12:51.074 --> 12:53.642
How can it just be gone?

12:53.685 --> 12:55.818
Oh.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.733
It's okay.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.431
Let it out. We're here.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.999
[laughing]

13:05.001 --> 13:08.178
What's happening?She's losing it.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.137
Come on, you guys.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.748
My romantic orchard
is now a Costco.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.010
You got to laugh.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.969
[Marjorie laughing]

13:16.012 --> 13:17.579
Or cry.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.974
Again, no more Christmases,
birthdays,

13:21.017 --> 13:23.541
accidentally setting
two places at dinner.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.413
Oh, God, I'm alone.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.241
[crying]

13:27.284 --> 13:29.591
You hit the wrong target.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.948
Here you go. Mustard, onions.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.602
Delish.

13:40.645 --> 13:43.953
How's Jill enjoying her
first time buying in bulk?

13:43.997 --> 13:46.042
She was scared at first,

13:46.086 --> 13:49.263
but last I saw,
she had a case of vitamin E

13:49.306 --> 13:52.048
and enough AA batteries to send
her vibrator to the Moon.

13:54.137 --> 13:58.054
I think we just bought
our last pickle.

13:58.098 --> 14:01.492
Geez, that bucket's
bigger than Victor.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.103
[laughs]

14:03.146 --> 14:04.278
Mom.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.584
What? Marjorie never
makes me laugh.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.064
You should be enjoying this.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.761
Yeah, lighten up.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.721
Actually, I think
you're being a little too light.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.071
What's that supposed to mean?

14:15.115 --> 14:17.073
I'm sorry,

14:17.117 --> 14:20.076
but for a woman who's carrying
around her dead husband,

14:20.120 --> 14:21.817
you don't seem very upset.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.081
[sighs] Of course I'm upset.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.169
Then why aren't you
showing it?

14:26.213 --> 14:27.692
How many times

14:27.736 --> 14:29.259
have you told us
keeping things bottled up

14:29.303 --> 14:31.522
is a great way to end up
with a bottle in your hand?

14:31.566 --> 14:33.698
Oh, my God,
you're just like a woodpecker.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.048
You're gonna keep pecking at me

14:35.091 --> 14:37.137
until I feel
the way you want me to feel.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.139
I was just trying to help.

14:39.182 --> 14:42.098
Want to help? Leave me alone.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.405
Marjorie, I really think...I don't want to hear it.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
I'll be in the car.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.153
Really messed that up.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.024
Yes, you did.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.726
This may have been a mistake.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.821
WENDY:
What did you say to Marjorie?

15:09.865 --> 15:10.953
[phones buzzing]

15:10.997 --> 15:12.650
CHRISTY:
Butt out, Nosey Nancy.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.783
WENDY:
Hey.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.091
BONNIE:
I know what she said.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.484
WENDY:
Then you tell me.

15:20.528 --> 15:24.662
CHRISTY:
Mom, shut up.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.055
TAMMY:
What's going on?

15:26.099 --> 15:28.666
WENDY:
Christy pissed off Marjorie.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.755
TAMMY:
Is that why no one's talking?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.453
BONNIE:
What do you think?

15:32.496 --> 15:35.238
TAMMY: Can someone
send me a life inCandy Crush?

15:37.284 --> 15:40.287
CHRISTY:
I was just trying to help.

15:42.289 --> 15:45.292
Sorry, I don't know how
I made that happen.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.122
Good Lord,
would you all just stop?

15:49.165 --> 15:50.688
What's going on?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.342
They're texting about me.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.083
What?
No. Candy Crush.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.130
You know what,
Marjorie, we were.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.262
And everyone agrees with me.

15:59.306 --> 16:02.091
What?
No. Candy Crush.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.354
Damn, I'm missing
all the action.

16:04.398 --> 16:07.836
This is why I need one of
those self-driving cars.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.838
There are self-driving cars?

16:09.881 --> 16:12.623
How long was I in prison?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.148
Fine, Marjorie, I'll shut up.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.150
Go ahead and grieve
any way you want.

16:17.193 --> 16:20.283
I'm not grieving.
That's the problem.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.981
Finally!

16:22.024 --> 16:25.201
I mean... go on.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.248
You know what my first feeling
was when I heard the news?

16:28.291 --> 16:31.033
First thing that went
through my head?

16:31.077 --> 16:33.470
Relief.

16:33.514 --> 16:37.300
Not shock. Not sadness. Relief.

16:37.344 --> 16:40.869
That's totally understandable.
Victor was suffering.

16:40.912 --> 16:44.133
No, I was relieved for me.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.051
You don't know how many times
I pulled up to the house

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
and didn't want to go inside.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.924
I felt like a monster.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
How were you a monster?[sighs]

16:55.144 --> 16:57.277
You were always there for him.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.366
Then what's wrong with me?

16:59.409 --> 17:01.237
I cried more over my cat.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.284
There was some discussion
of that.

17:04.327 --> 17:07.722
Marjorie, I see this
a lot at the hospital.

17:07.765 --> 17:11.117
[sighs]When people are sick
for a long time,

17:11.160 --> 17:14.903
their families mourn them
long before they're gone.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.166
Huh.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.560
Where was that nugget
150 miles ago?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.345
I actually said it,
but you all talked over me.

17:25.392 --> 17:30.049
The point is,
it doesn't mean you didn't care.

17:32.138 --> 17:35.750
Thank you, Wendy.
That's helpful.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.317
Wait a minute.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.014
She's helpful, and I'm not?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060
Not your day, woodpecker.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.024
So...

17:49.068 --> 17:51.505
six-hour drive,
and he just ended up

17:51.548 --> 17:53.246
in a different part
of the kitchen.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.206
Did Victor have
a second favorite place?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.947
Yeah, did he run over
any other animals

17:58.990 --> 18:01.297
on the way to doing
something romantic?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.734
I think I'm gonna
keep him here for now.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.519
Next to the sugar and flour?

18:05.562 --> 18:08.913
That's a bad biscuit
waiting to happen.

18:08.957 --> 18:12.308
I'm just not ready
to let him go.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.657
Take all the time you need.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.051
I will.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.574
Thank you.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.751
[whispers]:
Helpful.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.146
I'm really lucky to have you.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.061
All of you.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.456
Excuse me, Boz Scaggs
needs a little loving.

18:29.499 --> 18:32.415
He was Victor's favorite.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.983
Christy, I changed my mind.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.159
I don't want to be buried.
I want to be cremated.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.683
Why?So I can be with you forever.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.730
Or sprinkled
on the freeway. We'll see.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.517
Hey, guys.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.564
[crying]

19:01.488 --> 19:04.055
And then out of the darkness,

19:04.099 --> 19:07.885
the flying monkeys
zoom, zoom, zoom,

19:07.929 --> 19:09.583
zoom, zoom!What's going on?

19:09.626 --> 19:11.672
Turned out Tammy did a
production of Wickedin prison.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.717
She's filling us in
on what we missed.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.067
No talking in the theater.
And cell phones off.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.420
And then the bad witch
confronts the wizard,

19:20.463 --> 19:23.336
and guess what?
Turns out he's her father.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.076
Boom! Gut punch.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.166
Just like Luke and Darth Vader.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.646
And then Luke screams "No!"

19:29.690 --> 19:31.735
And then Darth Vader
chops his hand off.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.302
"Ow!"

19:33.346 --> 19:35.870
And then Luke gets a robot hand.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.961
Does she realize she
jumped to Star Wars? [Tammy imitating lightsaber]

19:40.004 --> 19:41.876
Who cares? She's killing it.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.707
Now, see,
I would have gone to this show.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.276
By the way,
you're still taking me to Cher.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.321
Fine, but I'm wearing this.
