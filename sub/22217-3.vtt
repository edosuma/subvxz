<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty:

00:01.380 --> 00:03.716
That company
Dad values most in the world,

00:03.799 --> 00:05.509
he should be giving it to me.

00:05.593 --> 00:08.012
Fallon, that is no way to talk
to your new boss.

00:08.095 --> 00:11.015
He offered me the COO position.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.474
Please, call me Mom.

00:12.558 --> 00:15.186
Windbriar. Heard of it?
With Jeff's backing,

00:15.269 --> 00:18.564
I will be chief executive officer
of Carrington Windbriar.

00:18.647 --> 00:21.233
- My own company, my name.
- It's my name.

00:21.317 --> 00:24.612
I know I said Cristal is the black sheep,
but we both are.

00:24.695 --> 00:27.656
Just know that I know everything,
Miss Machado.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.909
You've done questionable things
for family, too.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.455
There was no accident!
You killed my husband!

00:34.538 --> 00:35.789
We're here for Mr. Carrington.

00:35.873 --> 00:37.958
You have the right to remain silent.

00:54.141 --> 00:57.394
You like it when I pretend
to be someone else.

00:57.478 --> 01:01.023
I don't care who you are.
As long as I help you pick costumes.

01:01.106 --> 01:04.400
We should get you red leather pants.
That's '80s, right?

01:04.485 --> 01:08.697
Yeah. Except I've never been invited
to the Carrington Foundation Gala.

01:08.781 --> 01:11.909
I know. I think you'd look hot
in red leather pants.

01:12.284 --> 01:16.121
Now that you've tried this on,
how about I help you take it off?

01:19.708 --> 01:23.545
- There's no texting in the '80s.
- I know. I'm waiting to find out

01:23.629 --> 01:25.673
what's happening with Steven's bail.

01:25.756 --> 01:28.300
It's from Colby.
Says he has a surprise for me.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.973
Somebody sure does move fast
with Jeff Colby.

01:34.056 --> 01:35.558
I move fast for business.

01:35.641 --> 01:39.895
- That's it? Just business?
- Ugh. Why do men always have to ruin

01:39.979 --> 01:42.398
everything by talking
about their feelings?

01:43.357 --> 01:44.191
Hey.

01:45.359 --> 01:49.697
There is nothing going on between me
and Colby except for work, Michael.

01:50.489 --> 01:54.910
- Mm.
- Work... which I have to get to.

01:55.828 --> 01:58.956
Carrington Windbriar
is about to sign their first client.

01:59.498 --> 02:02.668
Well... you sure do move fast, baby.

02:02.751 --> 02:06.005
Pfft. Baby? Who do you think I am?

02:06.088 --> 02:09.592
- Carrington. Did you kill Matthew?
- Why did you do it, Steven?

02:09.675 --> 02:12.094
What was your relationship
with the victim?

02:12.886 --> 02:14.680
Dad, these charges are a joke.

02:15.347 --> 02:19.476
I heard a joke. My son gives millions
of dollars to an ecoterrorist group

02:19.560 --> 02:22.855
that kills my best engineer.
The DA didn't find it funny.

02:22.938 --> 02:25.774
He's accusing you of murder,
saying you had the means and motive

02:25.858 --> 02:29.236
to tamper with that equipment.
Were you at that site?

02:29.320 --> 02:30.821
How can you even ask?

02:30.904 --> 02:33.198
I had nothing to do
with Matthew's death.

02:33.616 --> 02:36.702
Honestly, I doubt
the Last Earth Coalition did either.

02:37.077 --> 02:40.748
They're using this to get free publicity
off the Carrington name.

02:40.831 --> 02:43.500
My name. And it was my money
you used to fund

02:43.584 --> 02:47.296
- these tree-hugging snowflakes.
- Just trying to do something good.

02:47.379 --> 02:50.924
- You wouldn't understand.
- You know everything. I don't think

02:51.008 --> 02:53.886
you need my lawyers.
Find your own way out of this.

02:59.475 --> 03:01.018
- Here, let me.
- Yes, sir.

03:04.563 --> 03:07.649
I'm sorry, Cristal.
My Spanish isn't very good.

03:08.317 --> 03:11.278
Anders, I've told you.
I've done nothing illegal.

03:11.362 --> 03:12.905
I changed my name so some

03:12.988 --> 03:16.033
of my less desirable family members
couldn't find me.

03:17.409 --> 03:18.869
Seems you're unsuccessful.

03:18.952 --> 03:22.206
Great tie. A different shade
of black than yesterday?

03:22.289 --> 03:25.376
That robe traditionally is worn
by a female guest.

03:25.459 --> 03:27.419
Maybe you can wear it to the gala.

03:27.503 --> 03:30.839
I've been thinking.
Considering everything that's happened

03:30.923 --> 03:33.592
with Matthew's death
and with Steven's arrest,

03:33.676 --> 03:37.221
do we really think now is the best time
to have a charity gala?

03:37.304 --> 03:39.223
From a PR standpoint,

03:39.306 --> 03:42.351
it could be considered trivial.
We should postpone it.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.770
Most idiotic idea
since Daddy proposed to you.

03:44.853 --> 03:48.148
You can't postpone
the Carrington Foundation Gala.

03:48.232 --> 03:51.068
- Bad timing. That's all.
- Know what else is bad?

03:51.151 --> 03:53.070
Kids' educations getting ruined

03:53.153 --> 03:56.824
because you were too stressed
to get a blowout. Great PR move.

03:56.907 --> 04:00.786
And you are such a charitable person.
I'm sure it has nothing to do

04:00.869 --> 04:03.956
with you wanting to mingle
with your father's contacts.

04:04.039 --> 04:05.916
I've known those people for years.

04:05.999 --> 04:08.711
The Carrington name is not only
my father's. It is also mine.

04:08.794 --> 04:11.422
As much as it disgusts me,
it is yours now.

04:11.505 --> 04:14.133
Which means you have responsibilities,
like it or not.

04:14.216 --> 04:17.928
You can't wash away the name
like you do your heavy foundation.

04:18.011 --> 04:19.137
Welcome home, sirs.

04:19.637 --> 04:22.057
Are you okay? May I get you anything?

04:22.141 --> 04:24.393
Yeah. How about some gratitude?

04:24.935 --> 04:29.064
- Good to have you home, big brother.
- Just in time for the gala.

04:29.148 --> 04:31.608
The latest Mrs. Carrington wanted
to cancel,

04:31.692 --> 04:34.445
but I'm concerned
it'll reflect poorly on you.

04:34.528 --> 04:38.407
No, if we cancel, it would look bad.
We should proceed as planned.

04:38.949 --> 04:42.786
That's one of the few things I'm proud
the Carrington name is attached to.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.080
- Be sorry to miss it.
- Why would you?

04:45.164 --> 04:48.375
I'm being charged with murder.
I can't go to an '80s party.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.754
We'll all be there to represent you.
And I'm looking forward

04:51.837 --> 04:53.422
to my first hostessing duties

04:53.505 --> 04:58.010
- as Mrs. Blake Carrington.
- Mm. Still gives me a thrill

04:58.093 --> 04:59.553
when I hear you say that.

05:05.184 --> 05:06.769
Hey. Care to join me?

05:07.269 --> 05:10.314
Maybe later.
There is something you can do, though.

05:10.397 --> 05:14.151
- Oh, no. There's many things I can do.
- Yeah, and I want them all.

05:14.234 --> 05:18.322
But right now, I need to prove where
I was the morning of Matthew's murder.

05:18.822 --> 05:22.493
And since we were together,
I need you to go on record as my alibi.

05:24.077 --> 05:26.497
I'm trying to avoid
the whole prison thing.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.414
Of course.

05:27.998 --> 05:28.832
Um...

05:29.291 --> 05:30.125
I just...

05:32.085 --> 05:33.670
I might not be very helpful.

05:33.754 --> 05:37.257
You see, I haven't always
been the stand-up citizen

05:37.341 --> 05:38.717
you see before you today.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.887
Me and my friends,
we got in trouble when I was younger.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.430
All stupid kids' stuff.

05:45.599 --> 05:46.892
I wanna help you but...

05:46.975 --> 05:47.893
But what?

05:47.976 --> 05:51.980
But if I testify, it'll only hurt you.

05:52.064 --> 05:53.815
With my track record,

05:53.899 --> 05:56.568
no jury will believe anything
I have to say.

05:57.861 --> 05:58.904
I get it.

05:58.987 --> 06:02.282
If I thought it'd be helpful
and not harmful, I'd do it.

06:03.158 --> 06:04.576
Thanks for being so honest.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.705
Kind of rare around this house.

06:21.134 --> 06:23.804
- We need to talk now.
- Calm down. What's wrong?

06:23.887 --> 06:25.430
<i>Mi mamá,</i> she was hysterical.

06:25.514 --> 06:28.350
She called me.
Her place got tossed. She was robbed.

06:28.433 --> 06:30.894
What if they find her?
She was so scared.

06:30.978 --> 06:32.145
She needs to lay low.

06:32.229 --> 06:35.399
- I'll get her money to relocate.
- Anything happens to her,

06:35.482 --> 06:37.651
- it's your fault.
- Nothing will happen.

06:37.734 --> 06:39.653
Easy to say that from your mansion.

06:39.736 --> 06:42.155
I won't let anything happen to my sister.

06:42.239 --> 06:43.156
Trust me, Sam.

06:47.202 --> 06:50.706
I'm gonna need new eyelash extensions
after all this buildup.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.624
- Better be worth it.
- Oh, it will.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.376
Check it out.

06:56.003 --> 07:00.841
- Why have you brought me here?
- To show you your new office.

07:01.758 --> 07:03.135
What do you think?

07:03.844 --> 07:05.596
You hate it?

07:06.346 --> 07:07.180
Pencils?

07:07.264 --> 07:11.643
You always say nothing is in pen
until it's first vetted by your attorneys.

07:12.185 --> 07:14.187
- Treadmill desk?
- Because as you say,

07:14.271 --> 07:16.106
sharks die if they stop swimming.

07:17.482 --> 07:19.526
And a fully stocked champagne fridge.

07:19.610 --> 07:22.946
Because anything worth celebrating
happens in the office.

07:25.282 --> 07:27.367
I can't believe how well you know me.

07:27.451 --> 07:30.287
Been studying you for a long time,
Fallon Carrington.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.960
I think you're great, Jeff.

07:38.045 --> 07:40.422
- I think you're great.
- Not like the thought

07:40.505 --> 07:43.550
- hasn't crossed my mind a few times.
- The thought?

07:45.177 --> 07:48.347
We need to keep
our professional boundaries in place.

07:49.014 --> 07:50.390
Oh.

07:50.474 --> 07:51.391
You thought...

07:53.226 --> 07:57.981
Uh, I'm flattered, obviously,
but your greatest asset is your brain.

07:58.065 --> 08:00.317
Wouldn't wanna ruin anything business-wise

08:00.400 --> 08:02.027
'cause you couldn't keep it
in your pants.

08:04.655 --> 08:09.326
Ah. Good news. Looks like the Kwan
brothers are backing us from now on.

08:09.409 --> 08:11.078
I thought they were investors
in your dad's company.

08:11.161 --> 08:14.581
They were until about one second ago.
I'm the one who found them.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.042
I nurtured them,
so, I decided to poach them.

08:18.377 --> 08:21.880
You've got your priorities straight.
It's not virtual champagne.

08:21.964 --> 08:24.049
- Fallon Carrington?
- Yeah?

08:25.550 --> 08:26.593
You've been served.

08:29.721 --> 08:31.014
A cease and desist?

08:31.556 --> 08:34.142
- Carrington name is trademarked?
- It sure is.

08:34.226 --> 08:36.770
- Since when?
- Since your mother tried to use it

08:36.852 --> 08:40.273
to start a line of lip-plumping kits.
Should I have Anders set

08:40.357 --> 08:43.610
- another place for lunch?
- You're trying to take my name?

08:43.693 --> 08:46.446
I gave it to you.
I can certainly take it away.

08:46.530 --> 08:48.532
You are pushing me into litigation

08:48.615 --> 08:51.159
so my investors
will get spooked and back off.

08:51.243 --> 08:55.622
You figured out my strategy. I guess
you learned at the feet of the master.

08:56.373 --> 09:00.627
If you think this is going to stop us,
you have seriously underestimated me.

09:00.711 --> 09:03.505
You wanted to play with the big boys,
little girl?

09:05.132 --> 09:06.258
Let the games begin.

09:20.003 --> 09:25.003
Subtitles by explosiveskull

09:30.091 --> 09:32.635
Want to try some
fresh mandocas with plantains?

09:32.719 --> 09:34.679
What do you have "on special"?

09:35.596 --> 09:36.681
Come. Let's take a look.

09:40.476 --> 09:42.645
I need to get money to my sister today.

09:42.729 --> 09:43.688
Ten thousand.

09:43.771 --> 09:45.606
Is this double the usual?

09:45.690 --> 09:48.067
Can your people in Maracaibo
make it happen or not?

09:48.151 --> 09:50.987
For 30 percent we can make penguins fly.

09:51.070 --> 09:52.822
Then make them fly quickly.

09:57.577 --> 09:59.662
There's a problem with your card.

09:59.746 --> 10:01.706
No, that can't be. Try again.

10:02.498 --> 10:04.000
The money is there.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.169
Come back when you have the cash.

10:10.757 --> 10:13.927
If the Whitneys are coming,
get plenty of Ostatrova.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.304
They slurp it like Pellegrino. Okay.

10:17.221 --> 10:20.183
Mrs. Carrington,
since you were so particular

10:20.266 --> 10:22.268
about the last event that I planned,

10:22.351 --> 10:24.896
I should pretend to consult you
about this one.

10:24.979 --> 10:28.107
That can wait.
I just got off the phone with my bank.

10:29.192 --> 10:31.861
And your checking account
has been closed.

10:31.944 --> 10:34.197
I took the liberty
of merging your pennies

10:34.280 --> 10:36.824
with Mr. Carrington's millions.
You're welcome.

10:36.908 --> 10:39.452
- I didn't authorize that.
- In your prenup.

10:39.535 --> 10:40.912
But why bother reading

10:40.995 --> 10:45.249
when you, like every other woman
who lies about her name, age or IQ,

10:45.333 --> 10:46.667
marries for love?

10:48.795 --> 10:54.217
The key to the castle. But I would think
twice before spending any large sums.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.220
I bring red flags
to the attention of Mr. Carrington.

10:57.303 --> 10:59.013
What about Mr. Carrington?

10:59.555 --> 11:02.058
Oh, I see you got your black card.
Fun, right?

11:02.642 --> 11:06.187
If you have any further issues,
don't hesitate.

11:07.522 --> 11:10.650
- What issues?
- No issues. Everything's great.

11:12.109 --> 11:14.987
Mm. I know you want
your financial independence,

11:15.071 --> 11:18.866
but I want total transparency in all
things, even something silly as money.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.952
- Blake...
- Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

11:21.035 --> 11:23.496
I don't want there to be secrets
between us.

11:23.579 --> 11:26.332
Secrets killed things
between me and Alexis.

11:26.415 --> 11:29.293
Go buy anything you want
from boots to boats.

11:30.169 --> 11:31.045
I love you.

11:37.677 --> 11:40.513
Damn it. The Kwan brothers
pushed us from tomorrow.

11:40.596 --> 11:42.265
Didn't bother to reschedule.

11:42.348 --> 11:44.100
Must've heard
about the cease and desist.

11:44.183 --> 11:47.436
No one wants to tie their business
to legal red tape.

11:49.939 --> 11:53.234
- Two more. Extra dirty.
- Two extra dirty. Right away, sir.

11:53.317 --> 11:57.446
Extra dirty. Another move
from Blake Carrington's <i>Art of the Deal.</i>

11:58.489 --> 12:01.742
Kompromat. We find something to use
as leverage over my dad

12:01.826 --> 12:04.328
- so he'll drop the case.
- Where is this dirt?

12:04.412 --> 12:06.622
If I don't know
where the bodies are buried,

12:06.706 --> 12:09.834
- I can guess who dug the holes.
- His chauffeur?

12:10.209 --> 12:14.630
Seems like he's wrapped around your
finger. Or are you wrapped around his?

12:14.714 --> 12:18.926
Culhane likes to do me the occasional
favor. He's got a little crush.

12:19.468 --> 12:20.428
I bet.

12:20.511 --> 12:24.640
Wanna come with me to an '80s gala
to benefit the Carrington Foundation?

12:24.724 --> 12:26.225
Asking me out on a date?

12:26.309 --> 12:30.479
A professional date. The Kwan brothers
will be there and so will Daddy.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.817
He wanted a war.
Let's make sure he's the casualty.

12:43.576 --> 12:44.619
Listen, Millie.

12:44.702 --> 12:48.873
Anders wants me to taste-test this
caviar, but I can't tell the difference.

12:48.956 --> 12:51.751
Can you try it for me
and tell him which one I choose?

12:51.834 --> 12:52.835
Of course.

12:56.088 --> 12:58.215
- Did you take care of things?
- I tried.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.135
It's complicated.
Anders is watching me like a hawk.

13:01.218 --> 13:03.846
- Somehow he found out my real name.
- What?

13:03.930 --> 13:05.473
I can't just ask for money.

13:05.556 --> 13:08.225
Secrets destroyed Blake's first marriage.

13:08.309 --> 13:12.146
I can't go and tell him my entire past
is one big lie. It'll kill him.

13:12.229 --> 13:16.776
- Better hope it doesn't kill your sister.
- Stop it. I'm figuring it out.

13:16.859 --> 13:18.986
It's <i>mi mamá.</i>
We have to do something.

13:20.029 --> 13:23.240
What about this?
I have friends who could fence it.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.994
What kind of friends do you have?
Besides, the jewelry is fake.

13:27.078 --> 13:31.707
- They use it to try on with the gowns.
- Do something, <i>tía.</i> Or I will.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.669
I'll figure it out.

13:35.461 --> 13:36.629
I always do.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.251
Madonna has one name.

14:13.334 --> 14:14.252
Rihanna.

14:14.335 --> 14:17.797
Kanye. You could be cool like that.
Just Fallon.

14:18.673 --> 14:20.883
I need him to know
it was a huge mistake

14:20.967 --> 14:26.055
- to choose Cristal over me as COO.
- I know you feel work is everything,

14:26.139 --> 14:28.308
but you are Blake Carrington's daughter.

14:28.391 --> 14:31.019
You will never lose your place
in his heart.

14:31.352 --> 14:33.563
What new honey vape
are you smoking?

14:33.646 --> 14:36.482
I don't care about his heart.
I care about his name.

14:36.566 --> 14:39.652
I need something that's gonna
make him back off that lawsuit.

14:40.653 --> 14:42.447
How about some front-seat intel?

14:43.239 --> 14:46.159
All of a sudden, you have
ethical professional boundaries?

14:48.286 --> 14:49.537
You know something.

14:51.039 --> 14:51.998
Come on, Fallon.

14:52.915 --> 14:55.460
Last week, it was obstruction of justice.

14:55.543 --> 14:57.837
This week, it's corporate espionage?

14:57.920 --> 15:00.506
Your little favors
are gonna land me in jail.

15:01.883 --> 15:05.094
You know what?
Why don't you ask Jeff Colby for help?

15:05.178 --> 15:07.305
- He's your partner, right?
- Oh, wait.

15:07.805 --> 15:10.350
You won't give me dirt on my dad
because you're jealous?

15:11.351 --> 15:14.854
My advice has nothing to do
with jealousy. Don't waste your time

15:14.937 --> 15:18.191
going after your father or his name.
Make your own.

15:24.489 --> 15:28.785
It's the privilege of the lady of
the house to choose the auction item.

15:29.410 --> 15:31.829
I can't even imagine
how much these cost.

15:32.330 --> 15:36.417
- These are rich-people problems.
- Make a choice, Mrs. Carrington.

15:46.427 --> 15:47.637
I need a favor.

15:47.720 --> 15:48.679
Ride into town?

15:49.097 --> 15:51.682
An alibi.
The morning of Matthew's murder,

15:51.766 --> 15:54.477
I passed you at the front gates.
I was driving in,

15:54.560 --> 15:56.396
you were driving the Aston out?

15:56.479 --> 15:59.774
Sorry, man. You know
I move these cars all the time.

15:59.857 --> 16:02.485
If you say you saw me,
I'm happy to back you up.

16:02.568 --> 16:04.779
No, no, no. I don't want you to lie.

16:10.118 --> 16:11.702
It's been a crazy few days.

16:12.578 --> 16:15.331
Does any of this craziness
have to do

16:15.415 --> 16:17.792
with you and Cristal's nephew?

16:19.168 --> 16:22.588
Seems complicated
considering everything that's going on.

16:23.131 --> 16:27.176
Out of anyone, I understand
complicated secret relationships, so...

16:27.260 --> 16:31.305
How long have you been hanging out
with my sister now? Three years?

16:31.389 --> 16:32.223
Four.

16:32.974 --> 16:33.850
Pfft, wow.

16:33.933 --> 16:36.978
- Well, I'll always keep your secret.
- You always have.

16:37.061 --> 16:39.730
Of course.
Practically one of the family.

16:40.898 --> 16:44.277
Which means you'll have to come
visit me when I'm in jail.

16:47.989 --> 16:49.157
Hey, Steven.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.074
Hold up.

16:52.702 --> 16:55.997
Look, I know something
that might help you with your case.

16:56.539 --> 16:58.458
How'd you like front-seat intel?

17:03.838 --> 17:06.715
Steven,
how's your innocence project going?

17:06.799 --> 17:09.635
- You ready for my lawyers yet?
- Just the truth.

17:09.719 --> 17:13.097
Remember how we agreed
to protect Cristal and the family?

17:13.890 --> 17:16.349
We erased every trace
of any connection

17:16.434 --> 17:19.103
- to Blaisdel from our lives.
- I gave the order.

17:19.186 --> 17:22.732
It wasn't about protecting Cristal
or the family, was it?

17:24.066 --> 17:25.526
It's about protecting you.

17:25.609 --> 17:29.071
The pressure getting to you?
Have a Scotch, do some yoga,

17:29.155 --> 17:31.157
- but leave my study.
- I know you have

17:31.240 --> 17:32.992
Matthew Blaisdel's phone.

17:37.955 --> 17:40.750
- Who'd give you such a crazy idea?
- Doesn't matter.

17:41.334 --> 17:43.211
But it should've been in evidence.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.713
Which means you got it from Stansfield.
But why?

17:46.339 --> 17:50.009
The only reason that makes any sense
is there's something on it

17:50.092 --> 17:51.302
that incriminates you.

17:51.385 --> 17:57.183
Son, let my lawyers take this over.
They'll have you off in less than a week.

17:58.267 --> 18:00.144
No, they'll be busy defending you.

18:00.228 --> 18:03.648
How dare you question me?
I have done all of this for you.

18:03.731 --> 18:05.316
I am protecting you.

18:05.858 --> 18:08.402
- And this is the thanks I get?
- There it is.

18:09.487 --> 18:12.532
There's that temper again.
You think your name means

18:12.615 --> 18:15.826
you can give everything with one fist
and smash it with the other?

18:15.910 --> 18:19.747
That's why I don't answer your calls.
That's why I left.

18:20.706 --> 18:23.543
And as soon as I'm exonerated,
I'm gone for good.

18:31.593 --> 18:34.012
Thank you,
but I don't think this is the one.

18:34.096 --> 18:39.268
- I'm feeling taffeta with puffier sleeves.
- Can't believe you're supporting

18:39.351 --> 18:41.687
Dad's gala
after the way he's treated you.

18:41.770 --> 18:44.856
I'm not. I'm going to support
the underprivileged children.

18:44.940 --> 18:48.277
You don't do anything
if it doesn't benefit you in some way.

18:49.027 --> 18:49.945
Mm-mm.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.825
Everyone who is anyone in the South
is going to be there.

18:54.908 --> 18:57.619
It's good for business,
plus the perfect venue to remind Blake

18:57.703 --> 19:01.373
I'm every inch a Carrington,
despite what he and his lawyers believe.

19:01.456 --> 19:04.626
Sure you wanna be associated
with the Carrington name now?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.295
Considering my charges,

19:06.378 --> 19:08.839
not to mention whatever mess
Dad's involved in.

19:08.922 --> 19:10.716
What did Blake do now?

19:10.799 --> 19:13.176
Pop one of his sleeping pills
and tweet again?

19:15.929 --> 19:16.888
What did he do?

19:19.099 --> 19:22.894
Oh, come on. You know no one
shares your Daddy issues but me.

19:25.188 --> 19:27.024
What if the issue is murder?

19:27.107 --> 19:31.153
Matthew? I know Dad's a Cristal addict,
but you think he'd go that far?

19:31.236 --> 19:33.030
He has Matthew's phone.

19:33.113 --> 19:36.325
- He stole it from him?
- He had it stolen from evidence.

19:36.408 --> 19:40.287
How do you know? You don't know anything.
You wear a belt with jeans.

19:40.370 --> 19:42.873
- Who told you this?
- Doesn't matter.

19:43.332 --> 19:46.585
There must be something on there
that makes Dad look guilty.

19:46.668 --> 19:50.172
Something he doesn't want
the world to know. If I can find it,

19:50.255 --> 19:52.716
it'd leverage him
and I can get my name back.

19:52.799 --> 19:53.800
And clear mine?

19:53.884 --> 19:56.595
Of course.
I would never let you go to jail.

19:56.678 --> 20:00.557
You look tragic in orange.
Where do you think he'd hide that?

20:00.641 --> 20:03.226
You know how Dad thinks
better than anyone.

20:03.310 --> 20:05.896
If you don't know where that phone is,
no one does.

20:30.170 --> 20:32.756
- I'm to give this to Miss Carrington.
- That's me.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.510
What do you think you're doing?
I always model the jewelry.

20:36.593 --> 20:38.887
This year, it'll be worn by an adult.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.556
You are the oldest woman
my father's ever dated.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.935
We're married, okay, for better or worse.
This is the better part.

20:46.019 --> 20:50.357
You misunderstood when they said
this is for charity. It didn't mean you.

20:51.441 --> 20:54.152
You keep trying to push me away
like I'm temporary

20:54.236 --> 20:57.948
like your Botox or any other woman
that's been in your life,

20:58.031 --> 21:01.910
- but I'm not going anywhere.
- Fine. Let her have it.

21:01.993 --> 21:05.664
Everyone knows I was born into diamonds.
Only way you could get any

21:05.747 --> 21:08.625
- was by spreading your legs.
- If only diamonds could buy you class.

21:08.709 --> 21:12.504
Wow. You are breathtaking.

21:12.587 --> 21:14.423
Thank you. Help me?

21:15.465 --> 21:18.510
The most beautiful woman in the room.

21:19.928 --> 21:21.596
Ah, Fallon, good. You're here.

21:28.729 --> 21:29.604
You're fired.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.070
What? What's the matter?

21:37.821 --> 21:40.157
Nothing. No, I'm just nervous

21:40.240 --> 21:42.784
to be responsible
for something so precious.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.956
You are precious.
This is a necklace and it's insured.

21:48.039 --> 21:50.959
Come on, there's so many people
dying to meet you.

22:00.177 --> 22:04.139
Wow. You look... gnarly.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.559
Pretty sure in the '80s,
gnarly meant brainy and gorgeous.

22:07.642 --> 22:09.311
Oh, the '80s.

22:09.394 --> 22:12.647
Greed was good.
I wasn't born yet, but I do miss it.

22:13.773 --> 22:17.319
You, uh, manage to get any dirt on Blake
from that chauffeur?

22:17.402 --> 22:19.446
No, but I got a great tip.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.242
And a plan in motion as we speak.

22:37.964 --> 22:40.509
- I've been looking for you.
- How may I help?

22:40.592 --> 22:43.887
I won't make you violate
your professional boundaries again.

22:43.970 --> 22:48.266
My skirt tore. I need the seamstress.
That's within your job description.

22:48.350 --> 22:49.935
Right away, Miss Carrington.

23:01.238 --> 23:02.113
Ah.

23:02.197 --> 23:05.909
The Kwan brothers. I'd love
to introduce them to my new partner.

23:14.251 --> 23:15.377
There you are.

23:16.711 --> 23:17.546
Come with me.

23:20.382 --> 23:22.259
- Okay.
- Right here.

23:23.718 --> 23:25.220
- No peeking.
- No, no.

23:27.013 --> 23:28.598
Right here.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.017
- Ready?
- Yeah.

23:32.686 --> 23:33.770
Ta-da.

23:35.188 --> 23:37.107
You can't go to the party, so...

23:37.774 --> 23:41.403
- I made you your own.
- I can't remember the last time

23:41.486 --> 23:43.780
anyone did something so nice for me.

23:43.863 --> 23:44.781
Aw.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.409
You are so nice.

23:51.830 --> 23:55.500
The winning bidder will go home
with this stunning diamond necklace

23:55.584 --> 23:59.087
modeled by the beautiful and brilliant
Mrs. Carrington.

24:02.591 --> 24:05.719
And remember,
all proceeds go to the foundation.

24:05.802 --> 24:08.096
Your generosity
is greatly appreciated.

24:08.179 --> 24:11.308
- Do I hear an opening bid?
- Hundred thousand dollars.

24:11.391 --> 24:14.269
- Two hundred thousand.
- Five hundred thousand.

24:14.352 --> 24:17.856
We're up to half a million
dollars. A great night for the kids.

24:17.939 --> 24:19.274
One million dollars.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.570
- Wow.
- Two million dollars.

24:25.322 --> 24:26.865
- Three.
- Three and a half.

24:26.948 --> 24:28.199
Four.

24:29.284 --> 24:30.452
Seven million.

24:32.871 --> 24:33.705
You know what?

24:34.539 --> 24:35.665
I'll go 10 large.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.461
That's $10 million.

24:41.212 --> 24:45.258
Going once, going twice,
sold to Mr. Jeff Colby.

24:54.351 --> 24:57.729
- That's quite a show, Jeff.
- What can I say? I like winning.

24:57.812 --> 25:00.732
No. I was baiting you.

25:01.274 --> 25:02.734
You bid way over value.

25:02.817 --> 25:04.778
I won. You overpaid.

25:08.031 --> 25:10.116
Can't overpay charity, Blake.

25:10.659 --> 25:13.953
- It's money for the kids.
- You were one of those kids.

25:15.121 --> 25:19.292
I paid for your education and success
with the Carrington Foundation.

25:19.376 --> 25:22.921
Success you keep throwing away.
What do you want with a necklace?

25:23.004 --> 25:26.716
- I'm gonna give it to your daughter.
- God. Haven't you taken enough

25:26.800 --> 25:29.969
from my family? I gave you
the opportunity to be one of us

25:30.053 --> 25:33.390
and you stole tech from my company
like a thief.

25:33.473 --> 25:35.266
The judge said it was mine.

25:35.350 --> 25:37.519
Thanks for the education, Blake.

25:37.602 --> 25:38.812
Now here's yours.

25:39.312 --> 25:41.314
I don't wanna be one of you.

25:41.398 --> 25:42.607
Neither does Fallon.

25:43.358 --> 25:44.943
Your daughter came to me.

25:45.026 --> 25:49.030
- She wanted to get in bed with me.
- You stay away from my daughter.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.200
You stay away from my family
and get out of my house.

25:52.659 --> 25:55.370
- Don't ever touch me.
- Son of a bitch.

25:55.453 --> 25:57.330
- Back off.
- What are you doing?

26:11.797 --> 26:14.800
I could be about to go to prison
for the next 20 years.

26:14.883 --> 26:18.220
- Not gonna happen.
- Innocent men go to jail every day.

26:18.303 --> 26:20.555
They don't have the Carrington name.

26:23.725 --> 26:26.520
That name
doesn't mean much to me right now.

26:28.397 --> 26:31.483
My father lied to me.
He thinks I had something to do

26:31.566 --> 26:34.236
with Matthew's death.
My father doesn't trust me.

26:34.319 --> 26:36.446
I know I haven't lived here very long,

26:37.072 --> 26:40.909
but maybe I can see what you can't.
The way your dad reacted

26:40.992 --> 26:43.578
the night you got arrested,
he was so worried.

26:43.662 --> 26:44.996
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.625
I watched him at my aunt's wedding.
When he looked over at you,

26:49.334 --> 26:54.005
- man, he was so proud you were there.
- I guess I didn't notice.

26:54.089 --> 26:57.718
He doesn't say it much,
but his actions say he loves you.

27:00.053 --> 27:03.181
You don't think he trusts you,
but maybe you don't trust him.

27:12.941 --> 27:15.819
- Can I help you find something?
- Where is it?

27:17.320 --> 27:18.155
Where's what?

27:18.238 --> 27:21.241
- Matthew's phone. I know you have it.
- Why would I?

27:21.324 --> 27:23.535
You're my father's plausible deniability.

27:23.618 --> 27:25.787
Anything he doesn't want,
he hides here.

27:25.871 --> 27:28.999
- Or at least you'd know where it is.
- Not this time.

27:30.208 --> 27:31.793
You may think you know him...

27:33.211 --> 27:36.173
but I know you.
I knew you were up to something.

27:36.256 --> 27:38.759
I knew that seamstress errand
was made-up.

27:38.842 --> 27:42.220
- I knew I'd find you here doing this.
- If you know me so well,

27:42.304 --> 27:45.515
- you know I need that phone.
- You're so worried about finding

27:45.599 --> 27:49.478
an advantage over your father,
and you already have it.

27:50.353 --> 27:51.271
It's you.

27:53.315 --> 27:55.442
Shut up and give me that phone.

27:56.902 --> 27:59.821
You are smarter than anyone
on Blake's contact list.

28:00.447 --> 28:04.159
Anyone at that company.
You never let anything get in your way.

28:04.242 --> 28:05.911
You are unstoppable.

28:08.246 --> 28:10.665
And that's what I love about you,
Fallon.

28:20.675 --> 28:22.761
I'm gonna finish what you started.

28:52.124 --> 28:54.042
I don't know
if I can do this, Iris.

28:54.126 --> 28:55.418
Too late now.

28:55.585 --> 28:57.379
Tell me you understand.

28:57.796 --> 28:58.839
Repeat the plan to me.

28:59.214 --> 29:01.258
You pick up Sammy Jo at school.

29:01.341 --> 29:03.802
I'll meet you at the truck depot.

29:04.052 --> 29:05.720
We'll go to Barquisimeto.

29:06.096 --> 29:07.430
That's our first stop.

29:07.681 --> 29:09.558
You can't be late.

29:09.641 --> 29:11.184
My friend has to keep his route.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.769
I'm giving you half.

29:12.853 --> 29:13.687
Take it.

29:13.937 --> 29:16.106
Take it and go. We have a chance now.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.984
With money like this,
we can get to America someday.

29:24.072 --> 29:25.949
Where are you, Iris?

29:26.116 --> 29:27.033
Celia Machado?

29:27.742 --> 29:29.661
- Yes.
- Do you have the money?

29:30.162 --> 29:31.079
Where's your sister?

29:31.163 --> 29:31.997
I don't know.

29:35.709 --> 29:37.294
If you're coming, we've got to go now.

29:38.712 --> 29:40.130
Last chance.

29:40.255 --> 29:41.631
We have a chance now.

30:04.446 --> 30:05.572
Tempting, isn't it?

30:05.655 --> 30:07.657
- Excuse me?
- I've been watching you

30:07.741 --> 30:11.411
with that necklace all evening.
Grasping it like Gollum.

30:11.494 --> 30:14.539
You look guilty for someone
who hasn't stolen anything.

30:14.623 --> 30:17.042
Guilt is an emotion I don't suffer from.

30:17.125 --> 30:20.712
- Guilt is for insecure people.
- Well, what about desperation?

30:20.795 --> 30:24.925
That's what I saw when you realized
that your accounts have been cut off.

30:25.008 --> 30:26.051
Look, Anders,

30:26.593 --> 30:30.096
whatever you know about my past,
you don't know me now.

30:30.180 --> 30:33.808
I learned that solving one problem
by creating another

30:33.892 --> 30:37.604
- gets you nowhere.
- It got you here, though, didn't it?

30:42.651 --> 30:44.611
I believe this belongs to you.

30:56.915 --> 30:59.584
Ten million bucks never felt so light.

31:00.085 --> 31:01.461
Have you, uh, seen Fallon?

31:01.544 --> 31:05.632
I know the general location
of every true Carrington at all times.

31:05.715 --> 31:08.635
Great. Cool, man. Can you just point?

31:41.251 --> 31:42.085
Hey!

31:53.138 --> 31:54.347
Oh, my God.

32:03.148 --> 32:04.065
Dad?

32:04.149 --> 32:05.066
Are you okay?

32:05.900 --> 32:06.860
Dad.

32:08.405 --> 32:10.157
I'm worried about you, Blake.

32:11.116 --> 32:12.242
No, don't be.

32:13.452 --> 32:17.039
This scar,
it's only gonna add to my allure.

32:17.122 --> 32:20.500
I don't understand who'd do this
or how they got away.

32:20.584 --> 32:22.878
Well, the police are completely useless.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.589
- You know who wasn't?
- My son.

32:26.298 --> 32:27.132
Mm-hm.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.177
Nice of him to save me for a change.

32:30.260 --> 32:34.097
Stop waiting for them to come to you.
If tonight had gone differently,

32:34.181 --> 32:35.891
if something happened to you

32:35.974 --> 32:37.476
- or Steven...
- You're right.

32:37.976 --> 32:40.437
I'll talk to him and Fallon.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.189
You're a good father, Blake.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.108
And a sweet man.

32:47.152 --> 32:49.488
Really best-case scenario
for a robbery.

32:49.571 --> 32:53.825
I'm fine. Everyone's fine. You know me.
I'm happy to leave a party early.

32:53.909 --> 32:55.702
Plus, nothing major was taken.

33:02.167 --> 33:05.545
I was wearing my gloves all night,
so, I didn't have it on.

33:06.421 --> 33:09.299
My engagement ring.
They took my ring.

33:09.383 --> 33:12.469
Come on, hey, hey. Hey, it's okay.

33:13.804 --> 33:17.349
Hey, it's only money.
I'll buy you a new one.

33:18.183 --> 33:21.019
Nobody can take anything from us
that really matters

33:21.103 --> 33:25.982
because besides my kids,
it's all right here in my arms right now.

33:46.169 --> 33:49.047
I cornered the Kwan brothers
as they were leaving

33:49.131 --> 33:50.674
and I turned them around.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.926
Wanted you to know.

34:11.987 --> 34:13.112
Don't stop. Please.

34:18.659 --> 34:21.246
You know,
your mother made you take piano.

34:21.329 --> 34:25.167
I never saw the point. Not like you
were gonna be another Van Cliburn.

34:26.501 --> 34:28.753
I wanted you to take boxing lessons.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.505
Now, those, they...

34:32.340 --> 34:33.717
came in handy.

34:36.969 --> 34:41.141
I was coming to find you earlier
because I wanted to apologize.

34:41.683 --> 34:46.188
I'm sorry I didn't believe you when you
said you didn't have Matthew's phone.

34:47.481 --> 34:48.315
Well...

34:50.692 --> 34:53.612
your source wasn't entirely inaccurate.

34:56.614 --> 34:57.449
I lied to you.

34:58.992 --> 35:01.036
I've bent the truth and the law.

35:01.119 --> 35:05.415
When Matthew died, I accessed
my source at the police department...

35:06.500 --> 35:09.753
and had him borrow Matthew's phone
from evidence.

35:11.463 --> 35:14.132
Dad, why would you do that?

35:16.092 --> 35:17.052
Jealousy?

35:17.844 --> 35:22.724
Morbid curiosity about Cristal's affair?
I wanted to see what was on there.

35:22.807 --> 35:25.227
- Can I see it?
- I returned it to evidence.

35:25.310 --> 35:29.481
Well, that part was true.
If there had been anything on there

35:29.564 --> 35:32.734
that could've helped exonerate you,
I'd not have hesitated

35:32.817 --> 35:35.612
to admit what I'd done.
I'm not proud,

35:36.154 --> 35:38.406
but I am proud
of who I am as a father.

35:39.282 --> 35:42.118
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to protect you.

35:46.456 --> 35:48.708
The thing I admire most about you...

35:50.835 --> 35:53.129
how much you care
about other people...

35:54.714 --> 35:55.549
how you love.

35:58.134 --> 36:00.345
It's always been your finest asset.

36:03.807 --> 36:06.810
I want you to stay here,
at home in Atlanta.

36:07.644 --> 36:10.522
If it's charity work you wanna do,
do it for me.

36:10.605 --> 36:13.567
Once my lawyers
get these bogus charges dropped...

36:14.359 --> 36:16.778
I want you to run
the Carrington Foundation.

36:32.794 --> 36:33.628
We alone?

36:33.712 --> 36:36.131
What happened? Is your mom okay?

36:36.923 --> 36:37.757
She will be.

36:38.883 --> 36:41.177
I can't do this anymore, Sammy Jo.

36:41.261 --> 36:44.973
Life's hard enough as it is
without everything else I'm hiding.

36:45.515 --> 36:48.893
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to Blake
and tell him I need the money,

36:49.311 --> 36:53.023
- even if it means losing everything.
- No need to do something stupid

36:53.106 --> 36:55.108
like tell a man the truth.

36:57.277 --> 37:00.196
I handled it. You're cool.
I got the money.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.656
What'd you do?

37:02.907 --> 37:05.410
Who do you think set up
tonight's robbery?

37:06.119 --> 37:09.039
What? Your ring's insured.

37:09.122 --> 37:12.417
I invite you into my home
and this is what you pull?

37:12.917 --> 37:14.502
My husband got hurt.

37:14.586 --> 37:15.795
He got in the way.

37:16.838 --> 37:20.634
A cut is nothing compared
to what could've happened to my mom.

37:21.301 --> 37:23.595
My friends will sell the stuff.
She'll have the cash.

37:23.678 --> 37:26.056
Do you know what blowback
this could bring?

37:26.139 --> 37:28.850
- I was handling things.
- Not fast enough.

37:28.933 --> 37:32.395
Anyway, everyone knows
you can't run away from your past.

37:32.937 --> 37:35.982
It'll always come back
and bite you in the ass.

37:43.865 --> 37:47.952
- Oh. Drinking so late?
- It's not for me.

37:51.998 --> 37:56.086
I appreciate you being at the fund-raiser.
I know this week was tough.

37:56.169 --> 37:58.838
I'm glad you're okay.
I was worried about you.

38:01.049 --> 38:01.883
Fallon.

38:05.762 --> 38:08.598
I was on the golf course.
I was three under par.

38:08.682 --> 38:13.103
I had just birdied when Anders phoned
to tell me your mother's water broke.

38:13.186 --> 38:15.146
- You finished the round?
- The 17th hole.

38:15.230 --> 38:20.443
What's a few more minutes? Of course
I didn't finish the round. It was a game.

38:22.612 --> 38:26.032
Your being born
was one of the greatest days of my life.

38:26.616 --> 38:29.244
I wanted to name you Ellen
after my mother.

38:29.327 --> 38:33.039
But Alexis said she had read in one
of those feminist books of hers

38:33.123 --> 38:35.834
the name "Fallon" meant
descended from a ruler,

38:35.917 --> 38:38.044
Alexis being the ruler of course.

38:41.047 --> 38:44.384
But I knew that my brand-new girl
would have my name, too.

38:44.718 --> 38:45.927
The Carrington name.

38:46.344 --> 38:49.764
I never considered that one day
you'd be my business rival,

38:50.348 --> 38:52.350
and a formidable one, too.

38:53.017 --> 38:57.230
But your name is your birthright,
and I won't take that away from you.

39:00.358 --> 39:02.736
- Thank you, Daddy.
- It's settled, then.

39:03.486 --> 39:04.821
Good night, sweetheart.

39:05.739 --> 39:07.031
Not settled.

39:09.159 --> 39:11.828
I've decided
I don't want the Carrington name.

39:13.246 --> 39:18.293
I've got Carrington blood.
That's all I need to take over the world.

39:29.220 --> 39:32.432
I'm cross-referencing
the missing items with our catalog.

39:32.515 --> 39:35.518
Unfortunately,
the current Mrs. Carrington's ring

39:35.602 --> 39:40.315
- is not the only thing that was stolen.
- Anders, I have an actual headache.

39:40.774 --> 39:42.776
Maybe your inventory can wait.

39:42.859 --> 39:47.322
The gold cigar cutter from your father,
the Harry Winston emerald cuff links,

39:47.405 --> 39:49.991
those ones Alexis got you
for Guy Fawkes,

39:50.074 --> 39:52.118
several of your lesser Rolexes.

39:52.202 --> 39:54.037
They took the watches
from my drawer?

40:00.502 --> 40:03.213
- It's missing.
- What's missing, sir?

40:04.422 --> 40:08.510
I had Matthew's phone taken
from evidence, and that man stole it.

40:09.469 --> 40:13.431
If what's on that phone gets out,
it will ruin the Carrington name.
