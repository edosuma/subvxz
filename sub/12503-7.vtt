00:00.126 --> 00:02.377
Previously on Life Unexpected...

00:02.378 --> 00:04.513
You've met Mr. Daniels.

00:04.998 --> 00:06.466
- You're a...
- Teacher.

00:07.164 --> 00:08.783
You don't have to be alone.

00:08.784 --> 00:11.797
I mean, there's plenty of guys
who would date you for real.

00:11.798 --> 00:13.474
You seem to forget I'm your boss.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.562
So, um, Julia's your ex.

00:17.563 --> 00:19.874
Yes, Julia and I dated.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.757
According to Paige, she
was the love of your life,

00:21.758 --> 00:24.525
which is a pretty big thing to
never mention in three years.

00:24.526 --> 00:27.776
When you and I broke up,
Julia and I slept together.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.163
We didn't even really talk after that...

00:33.066 --> 00:34.661
until the day before our wedding.

00:34.662 --> 00:36.431
Julia came to me,

00:36.432 --> 00:38.785
and she said that she
thought she was pregnant.

00:38.786 --> 00:40.170
What if she had been pregnant?

00:40.171 --> 00:41.880
Would you have called off the wedding?

00:42.274 --> 00:43.316
I don't know.

00:43.317 --> 00:44.589
Baze told me everything, Cate.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.199
He said you were over at his loft.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.890
He said it was you
that was having doubts.

00:48.891 --> 00:52.009
He said you were afraid that
you were in love with him? No!

00:52.010 --> 00:54.816
I-I put those feelings to bed
the second that I said "I do".

00:54.817 --> 00:56.531
What would you have done?

00:56.532 --> 00:59.611
Not now, but then? If he had
told you that he loved you?

00:59.612 --> 01:01.032
I don't know.

01:14.858 --> 01:15.989
Um...

01:16.898 --> 01:18.250
I was... I was going to shower,

01:18.251 --> 01:19.865
but you know, you... you go ahead.

01:19.866 --> 01:21.082
Yeah. I guess the days of us

01:21.083 --> 01:22.856
showering together are over, huh?

01:23.839 --> 01:25.066
Well, I hope not.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.445
Um, I mean, that's why we
have couple's counseling today.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.490
Well, you know, you could
just sneak over to Baze's

01:29.491 --> 01:30.879
and use his shower.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.346
Do you really want to start this again?

01:32.347 --> 01:34.435
Because I am not the only one
that did something wrong.

01:34.436 --> 01:36.699
Okay, see, now, I slept with someone

01:36.700 --> 01:37.514
while we were broken up.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.297
You went over to Baze's

01:38.298 --> 01:39.484
the night before our wedding,

01:39.485 --> 01:40.602
and you said you loved him.

01:40.603 --> 01:42.288
No, I said,

01:43.018 --> 01:46.033
"What if a part of me was in
love with him?" is what I said.

01:46.034 --> 01:46.923
A part of you?

01:46.924 --> 01:48.715
Do you hear how crazy that sounds?

01:48.716 --> 01:50.345
Okay, so what, so now
you think I'm crazy?

01:50.346 --> 01:52.310
Uh, yeah, "part of me" does.

01:54.145 --> 01:55.496
You... you going to use
the bathroom, or...

01:55.497 --> 01:56.704
No, I'm too upset to shower.

01:56.705 --> 01:58.932
I'm too upset to even be
in the same house with you.

01:58.933 --> 02:00.671
Well, you know what,
soon you won't have to be,

02:00.672 --> 02:02.353
because you have Lux's
school camping trip.

02:02.354 --> 02:03.841
No, we have Lux's school camping trip.

02:03.842 --> 02:06.158
But you know what?
If we can't even share a bathroom,

02:06.159 --> 02:08.753
I don't know how we are going
to sleep in a tent together.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.630
You know what?
You're right.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.982
Count me out.

02:17.545 --> 02:18.672
Knock, knock.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.083
What are you doing?

02:24.084 --> 02:26.330
This is my version of breakfast in bed.

02:26.331 --> 02:29.586
Maybe someday soon,
I can bring you the real thing.

02:29.587 --> 02:31.408
After we... You know.

02:33.043 --> 02:35.756
Sex seems a little
premature, don't you think?

02:37.211 --> 02:39.418
Guys don't like to hear the
words "sex" and "premature"

02:39.419 --> 02:40.970
in the same sentence.

02:45.274 --> 02:46.666
We can't do this here.

02:48.291 --> 02:49.757
Don't most people...

02:49.758 --> 02:51.282
start with dinner?

02:51.663 --> 02:53.101
Actually get to know each other

02:53.102 --> 02:54.957
before falling into bed together?

02:54.958 --> 02:56.569
I'm not most people.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.700
Right.

02:59.130 --> 03:00.760
You're my employee.

03:01.350 --> 03:02.458
And that's complicated.

03:02.459 --> 03:03.989
And I'm looking for something simple.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.345
Oh, I'm so simple, it hurts.
Come on.

03:06.346 --> 03:07.279
All right.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.623
Look, if we go out,
we have to be discreet.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.657
No one at the office can know about us.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.936
No, I'll find a place
that's off the beaten path.

03:13.937 --> 03:15.673
There's a... there's a hoagie hut

03:15.674 --> 03:16.848
halfway between here and Salem.

03:16.849 --> 03:19.965
I was hoping we'd go
someplace that required

03:19.966 --> 03:22.473
a little forethought and planning.

03:22.474 --> 03:25.063
Tomorrow night, I will find a nice spot

03:25.064 --> 03:29.186
that requires reservations and shoes.

03:29.187 --> 03:31.553
I'll have my assistant
check my calendar.

03:31.554 --> 03:32.955
I'm your assistant.

03:32.956 --> 03:34.260
Yep.

03:34.688 --> 03:36.214
Definitely simple.

03:40.672 --> 03:43.052
Thank you for remembering
your permission slips.

03:43.053 --> 03:46.274
In return, I give you your Holy Bible

03:46.275 --> 03:48.081
for this weekend's camping trip.

03:48.082 --> 03:49.660
It says what to pack,

03:50.248 --> 03:53.417
where to be at 8 a.m.
sharp tomorrow morning,

03:53.418 --> 03:56.177
a summary of all our activities,

03:56.178 --> 03:58.238
this trip would be completely lame

03:58.239 --> 04:00.448
if it wasn't going
to be totally awesome.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.181
Mm-hmm.

04:03.266 --> 04:04.823
It's kind of ironic, right?

04:04.824 --> 04:07.435
We were latchkey,
borderline homeless kids,

04:07.436 --> 04:09.643
and now we're signing
up to sleep outside?

04:09.644 --> 04:10.666
You realize this'll be

04:10.667 --> 04:12.496
the first time we've
gone anywhere together?

04:12.497 --> 04:15.630
You mean when we weren't
running away from someplace else?

04:16.053 --> 04:16.536
Yeah.

04:17.094 --> 04:18.474
I don't know, I'm just...

04:18.971 --> 04:20.266
I'm glad you're here

04:20.267 --> 04:21.923
to do this with me.

04:21.923 --> 04:24.306
You know, with
everything that's going on

04:24.307 --> 04:26.302
with Cate and Ryan.

04:26.863 --> 04:29.320
They're chaperoning the trip, right?
Cate and Ryan?

04:29.321 --> 04:31.075
Yeah. And Baze.

04:31.076 --> 04:33.422
It's going to be like
Survivor: Three Stooges Edition.

04:33.423 --> 04:35.912
Hmm. Well, good thing
other chaperones are coming.

04:35.913 --> 04:38.314
Mr. Daniels is coming.

04:38.852 --> 04:39.533
What?

04:42.837 --> 04:43.632
Hey.

04:46.731 --> 04:48.609
You can't go camping.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.187
Not only is half my grade going,

04:50.188 --> 04:51.935
but my entire family is, too.

04:51.936 --> 04:53.630
I just want to have fun.
I don't want to deal with

04:53.631 --> 04:55.649
this whole red light, green light thing.

04:55.650 --> 04:56.962
That's not what I'm doing.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.204
Really?

04:58.761 --> 05:00.529
Right. 'Cause you kiss me, and then,

05:00.530 --> 05:01.634
and then you start dating Paige.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.541
And you break up with Paige

05:02.542 --> 05:05.035
because you say you care about
me and you want to help me.

05:05.036 --> 05:07.674
And then you pawn me off on
some special ed therapist...

05:07.675 --> 05:10.276
who, by the way, has given
me like 1,000 disability tests

05:10.277 --> 05:13.333
- to figure out why I'm such a moron.
- You're not a moron.

05:13.334 --> 05:14.634
I have a thing for a guy

05:14.635 --> 05:16.585
who pulls me in just to push me away.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.470
So, yeah, actually, I am a moron.

05:18.471 --> 05:20.513
Look, I broke up with Paige because...

05:21.281 --> 05:23.280
Okay, you know why
I broke up with Paige.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.728
It's the same reason I can't be
your tutor anymore.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.486
I thought giving us some distance

05:28.487 --> 05:30.030
would let us both move on.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.582
I'm all for distance.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.245
So get out of camping.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.740
You came because you feel like
your marriage is in trouble.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.800
What issues are you trying to resolve?

05:43.696 --> 05:45.538
My only issue is that I don't understand

05:45.539 --> 05:47.521
where the hell my husband is.

05:48.164 --> 05:50.222
I see we're dealing
with some anger issues.

05:50.223 --> 05:52.035
What we're dealing with is a guy

05:52.036 --> 05:53.860
that won't admit he is wrong.

05:54.259 --> 05:56.222
yeah, you know, apparently,
I can't cross the street

05:56.223 --> 05:58.446
without doing something
to screw up my marriage

05:58.830 --> 05:59.800
and yet...

06:00.182 --> 06:02.944
You know, he practically
impregnates his ex-girlfriend,

06:02.945 --> 06:05.378
who I never heard of before last week,

06:05.379 --> 06:07.848
and he never mentions that
he's dealing with any of this

06:07.849 --> 06:09.681
until he's caught.

06:09.682 --> 06:10.793
I mean, I was putting

06:10.794 --> 06:13.285
my flowers in her vase.
How is that not wrong?

06:14.950 --> 06:16.483
Okay, what are you writing?

06:17.355 --> 06:17.857
Cate.

06:18.855 --> 06:21.116
A relationship is a two-way street.

06:21.117 --> 06:22.507
Take a step back,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.614
think about what your
expectations were going in...

06:25.615 --> 06:28.397
My expectations were for him
to show up here, and he didn't.

06:29.475 --> 06:31.998
I expected my marriage to
last longer than 30 seconds.

06:31.999 --> 06:34.090
My expectations were not that high.

06:34.091 --> 06:36.992
Maybe we should reschedule
for when you're both available.

06:36.993 --> 06:39.555
Why do I feel like you're
already on his side?

06:39.556 --> 06:41.293
That's an interesting question.

06:41.294 --> 06:42.750
Why do you?

06:44.217 --> 06:45.929
We should reschedule.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.447
Do you have a sleeping bag?

06:51.448 --> 06:52.737
Not yet, but Cate's going to take us

06:52.738 --> 06:54.524
to get some supplies after practice.

06:54.525 --> 06:56.917
Can we get a thermos so
we can sneak in some booze?

06:56.918 --> 06:58.515
They might search our stuff.

06:58.516 --> 07:00.063
But Cate can't go anywhere without wine,

07:00.064 --> 07:02.025
so we let her sneak it in,
and then we'll steal some.

07:02.026 --> 07:05.315
I'm so glad you use your
genius for evil instead of good.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.716
So... you're a foodie, right?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.715
Can't tell if that's an insult.

07:10.716 --> 07:12.978
No. I mean, you like food, so

07:12.979 --> 07:15.741
if I really wanted to impress Emma,
where should I take her

07:15.742 --> 07:16.855
to dinner, tomorrow night?

07:16.856 --> 07:18.972
Nowhere, because you're chaperoning.

07:20.078 --> 07:21.324
The camping trip.

07:21.325 --> 07:22.810
That's tomorrow?

07:22.811 --> 07:24.620
I thought that was next weekend!

07:24.621 --> 07:26.345
Hey, math, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.453
It's about the camping trip.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.352
Don't tell me you forgot about it, too.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.198
No, no, no. Something came up,
and I just need to get out...

07:31.199 --> 07:32.997
No one is getting out of this weekend.

07:32.998 --> 07:34.113
I've been planning this for months,

07:34.114 --> 07:35.377
and we need eight chaperones.

07:35.378 --> 07:37.411
So if anyone has an issue,
I don't want to hear about it!

07:37.412 --> 07:38.701
We're going camping, damn it.

07:38.702 --> 07:40.371
And we're going to have fun!

07:55.809 --> 07:59.746

08:02.047 --> 08:03.430
Hey.

08:03.431 --> 08:04.446
Hey!

08:04.740 --> 08:07.505
So? Are you stoked
for your camping trip?

08:07.506 --> 08:08.476
Ha ha, get it?

08:08.477 --> 08:10.190
Stoked? Like you stoke a fire?

08:10.587 --> 08:12.926
Ha-ha. How long you been
waiting to say that one?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.043
About an hour.

08:14.044 --> 08:15.480
So you fired up?

08:15.481 --> 08:18.693
Okay! So we have got the,
uh, last of our stuff.

08:18.694 --> 08:20.168
We should all be set now.

08:20.169 --> 08:21.020
What is all this crap?

08:21.021 --> 08:22.825
You have a bear-proof food container,

08:22.826 --> 08:24.404
you have bear deterrent spray

08:24.405 --> 08:27.401
and bear bells with magnetic silencer?

08:27.402 --> 08:28.987
Yeah. You didn't hear
about the bear attack

08:28.988 --> 08:30.238
in Montana last summer?

08:30.239 --> 08:31.829
Yeah. I heard it was in Montana.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.571
Mm. Okay, I'm going to go change.

08:33.572 --> 08:35.357
Save some of this fun
for the camping trip.

08:37.073 --> 08:37.912
Cate, what are you doing?

08:37.913 --> 08:38.785
We're supposed to be teaching her

08:38.787 --> 08:39.986
how to hear the call of the wild,

08:39.986 --> 08:41.740
not how to blind it with pepper spray.

08:41.741 --> 08:43.350
I don't know what I'm doing, okay?

08:43.351 --> 08:45.476
I am not a camper. Ryan is.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.492
Not that he is going to be there.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.702
Wait a minute. Ryan's not going?

08:49.703 --> 08:51.551
I need to not go. How
did he get out of it?

08:51.552 --> 08:54.115
Oh, um, well, he said that
he didn't want anything to do

08:54.116 --> 08:55.302
with me, and then he didn't even

08:55.303 --> 08:57.200
show for theraphy today so...

08:58.268 --> 08:59.323
you know? Whatever.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.447
A weekend away from his stupid
face is exactly what I need.

09:03.448 --> 09:05.414
I mean, even his stubble looks

09:05.415 --> 09:07.298
smug and self-righteous, you know?

09:07.777 --> 09:08.954
This is going to be fun.

09:08.955 --> 09:11.224
Yeah? Us, doing this together?

09:14.050 --> 09:16.343
Does math know that Ryan's not going?

09:16.344 --> 09:18.312
What's it like only to
hear what applies to you?

09:18.313 --> 09:19.768
Just answer the question.

09:19.769 --> 09:20.744
Why? Do you think it's a big deal

09:20.745 --> 09:22.540
that we're down one chaperone?

09:24.984 --> 09:26.091
Hi, Emma.

09:26.530 --> 09:28.004
I, uh, I wanted to talk to you

09:28.005 --> 09:29.885
about our date

09:29.886 --> 09:32.601
oh. You're canceling.
Why am I not surprised?

09:32.602 --> 09:34.209
Whoa, whoa! No.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.955
Not at... not canceling.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.649
Not at all, actually.

09:37.650 --> 09:40.538
I'm calling to extend the date.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.314
Instead of just Saturday night,

09:42.315 --> 09:44.478
what about Saturday?

09:44.479 --> 09:45.571
like, all day?

09:45.572 --> 09:47.800
Hell, let's throw in
Sunday while we're at it.

09:47.801 --> 09:49.301
I've... I got the perfect place

09:49.302 --> 09:51.111
to get to know each
other a little better.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.574
And... it is so off the beaten path

09:53.575 --> 09:55.357
that you'll have to wear hiking boots.

09:56.892 --> 09:59.317
No, seriously, do you have
hiking boots and a sleeping bag?

10:09.577 --> 10:10.853
Ah, Jones!

10:11.563 --> 10:12.623
You gave me your check.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.816
You know that we're only
going for one night, right?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.820
You don't have to match all the time.

10:21.961 --> 10:23.472
What's your boss doing here?

10:27.885 --> 10:29.790
Tell me you didn't bring a date.

10:29.791 --> 10:31.214
No. I brought a chaperone.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.777
To take Ryan's spot.

10:32.778 --> 10:34.125
You're welcome.

10:36.118 --> 10:38.708
Uh, okay, when you said camping,

10:38.709 --> 10:40.670
I thought you meant just us.

10:40.671 --> 10:42.290
Well, it is going to be just us.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.691
And, uh, well, half
of... Half of Lux's class,

10:45.692 --> 10:48.883
math, and Cate. Uh-huh.

10:48.884 --> 10:51.397
Now, you said you wanted
simple and uncomplicated.

10:51.398 --> 10:53.930
What is more simple than
getting back to nature?

10:53.931 --> 10:55.144
Okay. Come on.

11:08.157 --> 11:09.601
Is it okay if I, uh...?

11:11.452 --> 11:12.749
Oh, yeah.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.849
Yeah, I'll just sit with, um...

11:18.473 --> 11:18.775
Hey.

11:18.776 --> 11:19.655
Sit here.

11:37.324 --> 11:38.571
Lux, uh-huh.

11:47.584 --> 11:48.675
You came.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.125
I came for Lux.

12:31.490 --> 12:32.883
Now, this is an exercise

12:32.884 --> 12:34.814
in team building.

12:35.632 --> 12:37.685
There are three treasure
chests out there.

12:37.686 --> 12:39.799
I've given each team a map which will

12:39.800 --> 12:41.399
lead you to an obstacle

12:41.758 --> 12:43.347
to your team's chest.

12:43.348 --> 12:44.647
And what's the prize?

12:44.648 --> 12:46.292
Once all the chests

12:46.293 --> 12:48.736
are back at camp, we'll share

12:48.737 --> 12:49.888
what's inside.

12:49.889 --> 12:51.222
But what do the winners get?

12:51.223 --> 12:52.382
That's not the point, Courtney...

12:52.383 --> 12:54.386
The winners get a week
off English homework.

12:57.802 --> 12:59.795
Mr. Daniels is pretty bad.

13:00.353 --> 13:02.773
He is whatever*

13:02.774 --> 13:05.236
to be on the same team, so
you might as well talk to me.

13:05.866 --> 13:07.982
Whenever you want to
apologize for skipping therapy,

13:07.983 --> 13:09.578
I am listening.

13:15.687 --> 13:16.435
Hey, Baze,

13:16.436 --> 13:18.256
can I see your bandana?

13:21.554 --> 13:22.396
Here's the map.

13:22.397 --> 13:23.595
Yeah. Let's switch our team.

13:23.596 --> 13:24.861
Everyone have their maps?

13:24.862 --> 13:27.390
Okay, stay on the trail, stay together,

13:27.391 --> 13:29.071
and stay hydrated.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.558
Campers ready?

13:30.559 --> 13:31.866
Let's do this!

13:40.493 --> 13:42.370
You do know we're going in circles.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.052
Lux, do you want me to lead?

13:44.053 --> 13:46.332
I think it's, uh,
that way. No, it's just

13:46.333 --> 13:48.055
this map sucks.

13:48.056 --> 13:50.519
These symbols, they
look like teletubbies.

13:51.818 --> 13:52.356
Okay.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.694
This thing, it's-it's broken.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.819
I think we need to turn around.

13:58.519 --> 13:59.571
Wait a minute.

14:00.034 --> 14:01.277
There's Baze.

14:02.740 --> 14:03.828
Come on, Baze!

14:04.947 --> 14:05.756
Ha-ha!

14:05.757 --> 14:07.114
Are you kidding me?
We were ahead of them.

14:07.115 --> 14:08.122
We were, until someone started

14:08.123 --> 14:09.774
navigating teletubbies.

14:11.245 --> 14:12.962
All right, Ryan, you got it, buddy.

14:12.963 --> 14:14.039
Is it wrong

14:14.040 --> 14:15.513
that I hope that he falls?

14:15.514 --> 14:16.613
Everything okay

14:16.614 --> 14:17.789
with you two?

14:17.790 --> 14:18.852
It's a long story.

14:18.853 --> 14:21.219
I'm not saying what
Cate did was worse...

14:21.220 --> 14:23.851
Yeah, it all started about two
months before we got married.

14:24.263 --> 14:27.118
Yeah, yeah, you know, I
don't want to take sides.

14:27.119 --> 14:29.201
And yet, you know what,
I probably did have

14:29.202 --> 14:30.630
cold feet before the
wedding, only because

14:30.631 --> 14:32.576
I was sensing what he was going through.

14:32.577 --> 14:33.314
Good job, buddy.

14:33.585 --> 14:34.425
I mean, if you think about it,

14:34.426 --> 14:36.571
the way he was acting because of Julia,

14:36.572 --> 14:39.250
it's probably what drove me
to Baze's in the first place.

14:40.263 --> 14:41.548
Sounds like you and Nate had a

14:41.549 --> 14:42.978
really complicated relationship.

14:42.979 --> 14:44.368
yes, it is, it's complicated,

14:44.369 --> 14:45.892
and that is what Ryan doesn't get.

14:45.893 --> 14:47.966
And I haven't even told
you about high school yet.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.093
You know what, I think I'm up.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.188
All right, Emma!

14:56.445 --> 14:57.451
Yeah!

15:00.413 --> 15:01.102
I need off

15:01.103 --> 15:03.889
your crazy ex's team...
she's like a windup toy

15:03.890 --> 15:05.452
that needs to be institutionalized.

15:05.453 --> 15:07.795
Yeah, I would trade, but
Cate and Ryan, they're like

15:07.796 --> 15:10.414
a ticking time bomb, and all
I can do is try to defuse it

15:10.415 --> 15:12.736
before they explode all over everybody.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.527
Look it, we'll get our alone time later

15:14.528 --> 15:16.354
in the tent, okay? Mm.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.374
Wait, you should go.

15:19.258 --> 15:21.618
I obviously suck at leading.

15:21.619 --> 15:22.817
Lux, what's wrong?

15:22.818 --> 15:25.156
Nothing. I just... go.

15:25.474 --> 15:26.278
Tasha.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.085
Come on, Lux.

15:34.086 --> 15:34.725
Nice.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.378
Come on, blue, come on!

15:47.597 --> 15:49.887
Cate, grab it... grab it
higher, above the knot.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.321
We're not on the same team, remember?

15:51.322 --> 15:53.101
I'm just saying, grab it higher.

16:07.153 --> 16:08.029
There it is.

16:10.162 --> 16:12.665
Oh... if at first you don't succeed...

16:12.666 --> 16:13.828
Bite me.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.447
Huh, okay, according to the map,

16:17.448 --> 16:18.912
we should be right on top of it.

16:18.913 --> 16:21.499
All right, everybody, find the treasure!

16:21.500 --> 16:24.471
Thanks. You know what?
Thanks a lot for that!

16:24.472 --> 16:25.772
You intentionally throw me off

16:25.773 --> 16:27.052
so you guys could

16:27.053 --> 16:29.052
I didn't make you slip
off the rope, Cate.

16:29.053 --> 16:30.755
Why don't you stop
blaming everyone else for

16:30.756 --> 16:31.769
your mistakes? Right. 'Cause I'm

16:31.770 --> 16:32.880
the one that can

16:32.881 --> 16:34.023
hey, you guys,

16:34.024 --> 16:35.152
will you knock it off?

16:35.153 --> 16:36.820
Here's the blue treasure chest.

16:37.479 --> 16:38.353
It's a cooler.

16:38.354 --> 16:39.768
Ha-ha! That's ours!

16:39.769 --> 16:42.235
Hey! Don't-don't help them!

16:42.236 --> 16:44.280
We found your chest...
your team has to help us

16:44.281 --> 16:45.540
find ours. No, our team's

16:45.541 --> 16:46.946
going back to camp with our chest.

16:46.947 --> 16:48.120
Why don't you just go back to leading

16:48.121 --> 16:49.607
your team astray? You will realize

16:49.608 --> 16:51.024
you don't get to decide
the rules for everything.

16:51.025 --> 16:52.355
Come on! Give me this!

16:52.998 --> 16:54.303
Give me the chest!

17:07.407 --> 17:08.814
I'm sorry, okay? I am.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.161
When you grow up, you will realize

17:11.162 --> 17:12.910
that all relationships are complicated.

17:12.911 --> 17:15.531
I mean, it is not like you
see in the movies and TV.

17:15.532 --> 17:18.368
You know? You can't
always kiss and make up.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.457
Hey! There it is!

17:19.458 --> 17:20.337
The red chest!

17:20.338 --> 17:21.137
Oh.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.358
Marshmallows?

17:28.359 --> 17:30.123
Oh. Lame.

17:30.124 --> 17:32.568
Now we have to drag this
bitch all the way back.

17:32.569 --> 17:34.217
Dude, our campground's right there.

17:34.997 --> 17:37.434
It'll take an hour to walk,
and, like, five minutes to swim.

17:37.435 --> 17:39.109
Yeah, if we swim it across,

17:39.110 --> 17:40.479
we'll get back before everybody else.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.764
We could totally win.

17:41.765 --> 17:43.644
I could get this mud off.

17:45.019 --> 17:45.785
Uh, you know what?

17:45.786 --> 17:47.232
I-I think I'm gonna walk.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.567
Why? What's wrong?

17:51.061 --> 17:53.323
Um... I'll, uh, I'll come with you.

17:53.324 --> 17:55.489
Wait a second, isn't it faster to swim?

17:57.352 --> 17:59.262
What, can you not swim?

18:00.775 --> 18:01.414
I don't...

18:01.415 --> 18:02.934
Feel like going in the lake anyway.

18:02.935 --> 18:04.394
We can just walk back.

18:05.029 --> 18:07.839
Uh, you know what, Tasha, um, you go.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.809
I will... I'll walk with Lux.

18:10.295 --> 18:12.232
Is that... is that cool?

18:12.650 --> 18:13.475
Yeah.

18:14.353 --> 18:16.364
Uh, Emma, you want to walk with us?

18:16.365 --> 18:18.206
You know, I think I'd rather swim.

18:32.536 --> 18:34.633
There she is. Finally.

18:35.184 --> 18:37.590
It was a long walk... and we got lost.

18:37.591 --> 18:39.261
Did the, uh, red team win?

18:39.262 --> 18:41.757
Uh, no. We got disqualified

18:41.758 --> 18:44.166
because we didn't cross
the finish line together.

18:44.167 --> 18:46.703
And because someone's
mom sunk the blue chest,

18:47.314 --> 18:48.430
we don't have any dinner.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.679
Baze and Ryan went to
town to get some more food.

18:51.149 --> 18:53.985
And we're playing truth or
dare, if you want to go next.

18:53.986 --> 18:56.268
I'm good, thanks. And not ten.

18:57.409 --> 18:58.524
I'll go next.

18:58.525 --> 18:59.303
Dare.

19:00.010 --> 19:01.649
Okay, um...

19:03.437 --> 19:05.752
I dare you to kiss a
girl at this campfire.

19:06.549 --> 19:07.763
Come on. Um...

19:08.450 --> 19:10.169
Unless you want to make it a boy.

19:37.071 --> 19:37.990
Let's try this again.

19:37.991 --> 19:40.171
Lux... truth or dare?

19:40.172 --> 19:42.109
If you want to sit
here, you have to play.

19:43.976 --> 19:44.874
Fine.

19:45.676 --> 19:46.608
Dare.

19:48.326 --> 19:50.680
Go tell Mr. Daniels that he's hot.

19:52.242 --> 19:53.430
Truth.

19:56.449 --> 19:59.366
Uh, okay, who was the
last guy you kissed?

19:59.979 --> 20:01.923
I don't remember.

20:01.924 --> 20:03.476
God, you're hopeless.

20:03.975 --> 20:04.427
What do you mean,

20:04.428 --> 20:05.980
you don't remember? Bug.

20:06.939 --> 20:07.697
Tasha,

20:08.062 --> 20:09.050
truth or dare?

20:09.992 --> 20:11.108
Truth.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.723
Why are you friends with such a loser?

20:18.992 --> 20:20.713
Yo, yo, dinner's here, everybody!

20:21.587 --> 20:22.856
Time to eat!

20:26.451 --> 20:28.708
Lux, I'm sorry, she's a bitch.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.057
Doesn't matter... I didn't
come here to hang out with her.

20:31.508 --> 20:34.195
Hey, why don't we go snag
some wine from Cate's tent

20:34.196 --> 20:35.716
and go down to the lake?

20:36.145 --> 20:38.927
Lux... this is what
we came here to do...

20:38.928 --> 20:40.776
be like everybody else.

20:40.777 --> 20:42.374
And I know this high school camp

20:42.375 --> 20:43.703
stuff is kind of lame.

20:44.412 --> 20:47.303
I just want to experience it for once.

20:48.545 --> 20:49.314
Tash, Lux,

20:49.315 --> 20:50.071
you coming?

20:52.088 --> 20:52.679
Come on.

20:53.635 --> 20:54.664
Hey, um...

20:55.642 --> 20:56.758
You go.

20:58.727 --> 21:00.198
Go, it's all right.

21:02.179 --> 21:02.721
Yeah.

21:04.992 --> 21:05.742
Now, this,

21:05.743 --> 21:08.546
this is camping. Hey, you want
some fries with that? Yeah.

21:08.547 --> 21:10.949
Hey, well, at least Lux's dads are cool.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.781
Yeah, let's...

21:20.716 --> 21:21.574
Cate.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.066
Cate, wait.

21:25.896 --> 21:28.094
Are we having fun yet?

21:28.742 --> 21:32.963
For the record, I've
had a lot of bad dates,

21:32.964 --> 21:34.962
but this goes down as the worst.

21:35.289 --> 21:36.021
Really?

21:36.347 --> 21:37.196
Mm-hmm. Worse than

21:37.197 --> 21:38.755
the dude who wore guyliner?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.177
It was man-scara.

21:40.178 --> 21:40.978
Mm.

21:41.779 --> 21:44.863
You know... all I wanted to do tonight

21:44.864 --> 21:46.491
was to get to know you better,

21:46.492 --> 21:49.288
but instead, I've been assigned

21:49.289 --> 21:50.900
to sleep in a
two-by-two space

21:50.901 --> 21:53.123
with your lunatic ex. What?

21:53.124 --> 21:54.921
Hmm. Wait, where am I sleeping?

21:54.922 --> 21:57.589
Mm, with Ryan, because boys and girls

21:57.590 --> 21:59.761
can't sleep in the same tent together.

21:59.762 --> 22:00.804
That's awesome.

22:00.805 --> 22:01.992
Yeah, it's school policy.

22:01.993 --> 22:05.117
My blackberry has no reception,
so I can't even text anyone

22:05.118 --> 22:06.695
to bitch about how miserable this is,

22:06.696 --> 22:10.345
or about how clearly I am the
last thing on your mind, mm.

22:10.346 --> 22:12.291
And about the fact that
I have mosquito bites

22:12.292 --> 22:14.929
in places that mosquitoes
shouldn't be able to access.

22:14.930 --> 22:16.111
Well, that's not true.

22:16.112 --> 22:17.566
Now, don't make me show you, really.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.376
No, no, no, not about the mosquitoes.

22:20.262 --> 22:22.690
About you being the
last thing on my mind.

22:24.986 --> 22:26.183
Come with me.

22:27.818 --> 22:28.372
Come on.

22:29.879 --> 22:31.584
Step, step.

22:32.849 --> 22:34.223
All right, this...

22:34.244 --> 22:36.671
Is why I went with Ryan in town.

22:36.672 --> 22:38.786
Because I wanted to do something,

22:38.787 --> 22:43.535
something that required
forethought and planning.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.515
Like a real date should.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.720
And, um...

22:54.078 --> 22:56.565
What is a real date without a dance?

23:04.429 --> 23:05.622
You wanna?

23:28.071 --> 23:29.034
Hey.

23:33.788 --> 23:34.748
Lux.

23:35.742 --> 23:36.876
What?

23:37.932 --> 23:38.915
What are you doing?

23:41.026 --> 23:43.445
Well, supposedly collecting firewood.

23:44.455 --> 23:46.065
And checking to see how you are.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.779
You all right?

23:49.232 --> 23:50.308
I'm okay.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.841
No, I just, I...

23:54.163 --> 23:55.999
I thought this trip
was gonna be different.

23:56.778 --> 23:58.437
Fun, you know?

23:59.002 --> 24:00.454
But Cate and Ryan...

24:01.627 --> 24:03.847
I-I don't know if
they're gonna fix things.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.040
And Baze is with Emma.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.385
An-and Tasha...

24:07.900 --> 24:10.328
I-I just feel like
she's leaving me behind.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.863
Like today, they all went in the water,

24:12.864 --> 24:16.025
and I just kind of stand
on the shore and watch.

24:18.583 --> 24:19.804
Yeah, I heard.

24:21.659 --> 24:23.293
So you don't know how to swim.

24:23.294 --> 24:24.549
You can learn.

24:26.023 --> 24:28.089
Look, I know that you want to fit in.

24:28.517 --> 24:30.507
As much as you pretend that you don't.

24:31.181 --> 24:33.970
But there's a reason that you don't.

24:35.157 --> 24:36.427
All those other kids, um...

24:37.320 --> 24:39.202
Kids trying to be grown-ups.

24:40.948 --> 24:42.490
You are grown-up...

24:43.577 --> 24:45.267
Trying to act like a kid.

24:46.721 --> 24:47.973
What are we doing?

24:49.020 --> 24:51.127
I keep telling myself to stay away,

24:52.559 --> 24:53.186
and I thought that

24:53.187 --> 24:56.361
not tutoring you would
create some distance.

24:58.122 --> 24:58.782
The problem is,

24:58.783 --> 25:00.749
I don't want any distance.

25:02.964 --> 25:04.368
So what do we do?

25:06.627 --> 25:08.803
They're all back up
at camp eating, right?

25:09.432 --> 25:10.703
Yeah.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.886
Well, you want to learn how to swim?

25:14.374 --> 25:15.469
Not...

25:16.328 --> 25:17.468
Not really.

25:17.703 --> 25:20.185
It's cold. Come on, eeyore.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.983
To overcome your fears,
you got to take the plunge.

25:25.802 --> 25:27.733
Don't worry, I'm right here.

25:30.255 --> 25:32.684
Cate, wait, where are you
going? Wherever you aren't.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.752
Aren't there some starving
kids you want to feed

25:34.753 --> 25:36.360
or some puppies you want to save?

25:36.361 --> 25:38.646
You know, this whole time,
you have been pretending

25:38.647 --> 25:40.615
to be this great guy,
and I have just been

25:40.616 --> 25:42.042
trying to be worthy of you.

25:42.043 --> 25:44.702
I mean, I put you up
on this giant pedestal

25:44.703 --> 25:45.978
like you're perfect.

25:47.832 --> 25:49.921
What can't you understand, huh?

25:49.922 --> 25:51.803
All I was trying to
do was the right thing.

25:51.804 --> 25:54.183
God, I love it... when you lie,

25:54.184 --> 25:55.453
it's "doing the right thing,"

25:55.454 --> 25:57.804
and when I lie, I'm
a dysfunctional shrew.

25:57.805 --> 25:59.893
It was the right thing, Cate!

25:59.929 --> 26:02.126
I mean, how many frickin'
times have you railed at Baze

26:02.127 --> 26:03.880
for not being accountable,
for not being there

26:03.881 --> 26:05.481
when you were pregnant?

26:05.482 --> 26:07.465
I did what I thought
you'd want me to do.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.688
Really! Yes, I really wanted you

26:09.689 --> 26:11.437
to sleep with yot everyone else.

26:11.438 --> 26:12.864
And then lie to me about it

26:12.865 --> 26:14.849
on our wedding day!

26:14.850 --> 26:17.732
All right, you want me to
admit that I'm as bad as you?

26:17.733 --> 26:18.802
Is that what you want?

26:18.803 --> 26:20.893
You want to blame
everyone except yourself?

26:21.591 --> 26:24.121
I mean, you spent what,
16 years blaming Baze,

26:24.122 --> 26:26.370
and now what, you're gonna
spend the next 16 blaming me?

26:26.371 --> 26:28.649
Don't worry about everyone else.

26:28.869 --> 26:30.519
Just take some responsibility for

26:30.520 --> 26:32.089
- the choices that you make.
- I am, Ryan!

26:32.090 --> 26:34.138
What do you think I'm doing here?!

26:34.139 --> 26:36.777
Okay? Every single
part of me wants to run,

26:36.778 --> 26:38.873
but I am here, I am fighting

26:38.874 --> 26:40.544
for you!

26:41.237 --> 26:45.162
I'm fighting for... don't you
touch me! Cate, Cate, Cate...

26:45.163 --> 26:47.226
Stop it. No, don't! Don't you...

28:22.302 --> 28:23.691
Did you see someone?

28:23.692 --> 28:25.594
No, I just... I heard what you heard.

28:25.595 --> 28:26.654
What if someone saw us?

28:26.655 --> 28:27.682
I don't know.

28:29.338 --> 28:29.918
Wait.

28:29.919 --> 28:30.377
Here.

28:32.205 --> 28:33.732
Wow. I know.

28:33.733 --> 28:36.161
That may have been the
best sex we've ever had.

28:36.162 --> 28:39.328
Yeah. Well, you know what
they say about breakup sex.

28:39.827 --> 28:41.491
Makeup sex.

28:47.808 --> 28:49.707
Wait, we're not making up, are we?

28:59.003 --> 29:01.427
Are you walking away from this marriage?

29:02.502 --> 29:03.959
I don't know.

29:04.828 --> 29:06.546
You know, it's, like, uh...

29:08.003 --> 29:09.763
I won't be able to look
myself in the mirror

29:09.764 --> 29:10.998
if I leave...

29:12.887 --> 29:14.526
...Or if I stay.

29:22.789 --> 29:25.389
What I did, yeah, you know, I suck.

29:26.282 --> 29:28.159
Okay, we all know I suck.

29:29.730 --> 29:32.241
But you knew exactly who I
was, Ryan... I mean, you know,

29:32.242 --> 29:33.275
and that's the difference.

29:33.276 --> 29:35.221
I mean, you knew that I sabotage things

29:35.222 --> 29:36.560
and I screw them up.

29:37.393 --> 29:39.353
You knew about my history with Baze,

29:39.354 --> 29:41.078
and you knew that it was complicated.

29:43.317 --> 29:46.332
I mean, you knew
exactly who you married.

29:48.189 --> 29:49.282
You know, and I married you

29:49.283 --> 29:51.870
because I thought I
knew exactly who you are,

29:51.871 --> 29:54.322
and now I don't even recognize you.

29:57.894 --> 29:59.330
You know, and maybe that's the reason

29:59.331 --> 30:01.684
why you can't look yourself in
the mirror, because you don't

30:01.685 --> 30:03.553
recognize yourself, either.

30:13.082 --> 30:14.272
Mind-blowing.

30:14.821 --> 30:17.046
Yeah. It was.

30:17.934 --> 30:19.222
I meant the fries.

30:20.785 --> 30:21.876
So did I.

30:28.079 --> 30:29.635
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Um...

30:31.197 --> 30:33.088
Someone said that you were
on the bus... I didn't know

30:33.089 --> 30:34.104
that you were with her.

30:34.105 --> 30:35.079
I'm-I'm sorry.

30:38.690 --> 30:39.893
Sorry about that.

30:41.451 --> 30:42.854
You should go talk to her.

30:43.069 --> 30:45.274
No, you know, I think that
I have ignored you enough

30:45.275 --> 30:47.401
on this trip already. I know I told you

30:47.402 --> 30:49.357
that I wanted something simple,

30:49.358 --> 30:52.002
but I think... Maybe I just said that

30:52.003 --> 30:54.581
because my life has been so complicated.

30:55.929 --> 30:57.088
What you have...

30:57.667 --> 30:59.449
With Lux and Cate,

31:00.011 --> 31:01.489
you can't change that,

31:01.703 --> 31:03.523
and I'm not gonna ask you to.

31:04.228 --> 31:05.785
Cate needs you now.

31:08.263 --> 31:11.590
Really, otherwise I'm gonna
have to hear about it all night.

31:11.591 --> 31:12.983
So please, go.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.366
You okay?

31:36.967 --> 31:38.116
You're the one person

31:38.117 --> 31:39.504
I thought would be here for me.

31:39.820 --> 31:41.380
Cate, I'm here.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.314
Cate, look at me.

31:45.614 --> 31:46.803
I'm here.

31:47.478 --> 31:48.675
No, you're not.

31:50.237 --> 31:51.543
You moved on.

31:52.055 --> 31:53.227
You know? You're over me.

31:53.228 --> 31:55.641
You're hanging out on a bus with Emma,

31:55.642 --> 31:58.204
you're acting all buddy-buddy
with Ryan when he won't even

31:58.205 --> 32:00.109
talk to me, you know,
when he doesn't even know

32:00.110 --> 32:01.870
if he wants to stay married to me.

32:05.115 --> 32:06.240
I married him.

32:06.241 --> 32:09.000
I mean, I married him
because he was better than me.

32:13.739 --> 32:15.806
You know, he was supposed
to be this perfect guy...

32:15.807 --> 32:17.754
that was our deal... and he's not.

32:17.755 --> 32:18.656
He's...

32:21.863 --> 32:22.642
He's me.

32:22.643 --> 32:25.215
I don't want to be
married to me... I hate me.

32:25.216 --> 32:26.971
Well, you shouldn't.

32:28.808 --> 32:30.165
I don't.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.394
Come here.

32:35.567 --> 32:36.511
Come here.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.951
Oh. Hey, Tash.

32:54.162 --> 32:55.795
What are you doing, Lux?

32:56.905 --> 32:57.958
What do you mean?

32:58.299 --> 32:59.808
Don't play dumb, okay?

32:59.809 --> 33:02.294
I saw you. Mr. Daniels.

33:02.295 --> 33:04.119
Oh, my God, that was you?

33:04.120 --> 33:06.810
God, we were freaking out.

33:07.591 --> 33:09.919
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you... I wanted to.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.458
Are you crazy?

33:11.459 --> 33:12.576
Do you know what you're doing?

33:12.577 --> 33:15.387
Do you know how much trouble
you guys could get into?

33:15.388 --> 33:18.468
Look, I'm sorry if you felt ditched.

33:18.469 --> 33:20.217
Okay? But hooking up with a teacher

33:20.218 --> 33:23.384
isn't exactly a recipe
to make you fit in more.

33:24.675 --> 33:25.743
We've been best friends

33:25.744 --> 33:28.573
since we were seven, Lux...
nothing can change that...

33:28.574 --> 33:32.222
but we don't have to be
these, like, borderline

33:32.223 --> 33:33.978
homeless kids anymore,

33:33.979 --> 33:35.364
looking in from the outside.

33:35.365 --> 33:39.933
We have a shot at being
regular teenagers, together.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.435
Okay? So don't screw that up, please.

33:46.021 --> 33:48.902
Whatever's going on between
you two, you need to stop.

34:09.391 --> 34:10.407
What the hell, man?

34:12.210 --> 34:14.129
Yeah, if I wanted to
spoon, I would've...

34:14.571 --> 34:16.014
Taken a tent with Cate.

34:19.688 --> 34:21.947
Yeah, she was pretty
upset last night, huh?

34:22.331 --> 34:23.938
Yeah. I noticed.

34:24.503 --> 34:27.206
You know... what she wants you to say.

34:27.811 --> 34:29.195
I mean, you know, maybe you could just

34:29.196 --> 34:30.598
throw her a bone and say it.

34:32.228 --> 34:35.768
You know... I'm so used
to you being the problem

34:35.768 --> 34:37.005
in our relationship.

34:37.005 --> 34:39.672
If it wasn't you, it was... it was Cate.

34:41.143 --> 34:43.732
I guess it's just hard
to admit it could be me.

34:43.922 --> 34:44.681
Well...

34:44.918 --> 34:47.754
well, trust me, blaming
yourself is easier.

34:53.071 --> 34:55.793
You know, Cate, she's always
been this broken person.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.920
Ever since I met her, I just felt
like it was my job to fix her.

35:00.921 --> 35:02.783
It was kind of our deal, you know?

35:02.784 --> 35:04.425
I mean, even on the radio,

35:04.774 --> 35:05.754
I was this...

35:05.977 --> 35:08.704
Stable, good guy, and she was the crazy,

35:08.705 --> 35:10.612
screwed-up sidekick.

35:13.866 --> 35:16.996
I felt like I had to be that guy to her.

35:18.362 --> 35:19.425
'Cause if I wasn't...

35:21.594 --> 35:23.406
She wouldn't have marry me.

35:27.666 --> 35:29.141
Now, who knows?

35:30.073 --> 35:31.622
She knew what she was getting.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.828
A guy just like everybody else.

35:36.554 --> 35:37.996
The night on your deck,

35:38.900 --> 35:40.288
the day of the wedding...

35:43.383 --> 35:44.923
She might've chosen you.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.240
No, she wouldn't have.

35:55.771 --> 35:57.483
She loves you, Ryan.

35:57.683 --> 36:00.497
Trust me, she's told me
that many, many times.

36:02.180 --> 36:04.434
You guys were both afraid
of the same thing...

36:05.828 --> 36:07.836
that whatever was going
on on your wedding day

36:07.837 --> 36:09.093
was gonna drive you apart,

36:09.094 --> 36:11.028
it was gonna make the
other one jump ship.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.493
But if you went to all of those lengths

36:16.683 --> 36:18.358
to keep Cate, then...

36:20.177 --> 36:21.556
Don't let her go.

36:23.228 --> 36:24.642
Fight for her now.

36:33.015 --> 36:33.965
Hi.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.123
Hey.

36:38.147 --> 36:39.869
They're packing up camp.

36:40.638 --> 36:43.139
I'm trying to get out of doing anything.

36:44.891 --> 36:45.908
You okay?

36:46.630 --> 36:47.797
Yeah, yeah.

36:47.996 --> 36:51.584
I was, um... just hiding out, too.

36:53.569 --> 36:56.212
So, you and Baze, that's... new.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.327
Yeah. It's, uh...

36:59.462 --> 37:00.522
weird.

37:01.463 --> 37:02.715
And wrong, but...

37:02.813 --> 37:05.872
Why? You're both consenting
adults... no big deal.

37:05.873 --> 37:08.750
Well, I'm... older than him.

37:08.751 --> 37:10.248
By what, a few years?

37:10.249 --> 37:12.088
Yeah, but mentally,
it's more like 20, so...

37:13.496 --> 37:14.754
I'm his boss.

37:15.325 --> 37:17.038
You know, I could lose my job.

37:17.786 --> 37:19.445
So why do it, then?

37:19.641 --> 37:24.015
Why date Baze if there's
all those reasons not to?

37:25.187 --> 37:26.594
Why risk it?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.281
Because...

37:28.726 --> 37:30.336
you're too young to know this...

37:30.725 --> 37:34.103
but a Baze doesn't
come around every day.

37:34.263 --> 37:36.460
Yeah, I guess most guys don't take you

37:36.461 --> 37:38.535
on their kids' camping
trips as a first date.

37:38.743 --> 37:40.472
Or decorate a bus for you.

37:40.662 --> 37:42.247
And take you to the ocean.

37:43.632 --> 37:45.147
Hypothetically.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.537
I've spent so much time
trying to convince myself

37:49.538 --> 37:51.096
that we won't work

37:51.097 --> 37:53.139
and that we're doing something
wrong, but it doesn't...

37:53.140 --> 37:54.593
Feel wrong.

37:55.159 --> 37:57.133
Maybe it means it's actually right.

38:00.618 --> 38:02.844
I didn't mean to say all
that; I don't know why I did.

38:04.971 --> 38:07.957
You seem a lot older than 16...
You know that, right?

38:08.879 --> 38:10.879
I'm glad Baze met you.

38:11.241 --> 38:12.659
After all he's been through, he...

38:13.616 --> 38:14.859
he needed you.

38:16.649 --> 38:18.629
Hey, are you guys gonna, uh...

38:19.408 --> 38:20.784
help clean up?

38:20.965 --> 38:21.693
Sure.

38:21.861 --> 38:24.738
I'll just... pee in
the woods one more time.

38:24.975 --> 38:26.986
So I'm gonna really miss that.

38:33.162 --> 38:34.461
So, it was Tasha.

38:35.605 --> 38:36.728
She's the one who saw us,

38:36.964 --> 38:39.274
and she won't say anything.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.582
Don't look at me like that.

38:44.357 --> 38:45.516
Like what?

38:46.069 --> 38:48.165
Like it hurts to look at my face.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.730
Lux, it's not you.

38:51.731 --> 38:54.654
I screwed up, and I keep screwing up.

38:55.397 --> 38:56.477
But what I'm doing...

38:57.153 --> 38:58.587
I mean, what I've done,

38:59.292 --> 39:00.863
it's wrong.

39:01.634 --> 39:03.500
How we feel isn't wrong.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.813
It's just how we feel.

39:07.372 --> 39:09.191
Look, I know that there are boundaries

39:09.192 --> 39:12.158
you don't want to cross and
rules you don't want to break,

39:12.159 --> 39:13.884
but they've already been broken.

39:13.979 --> 39:15.255
They were broken the moment that you

39:15.256 --> 39:17.915
took me to see the ocean,
and we didn't even know it.

39:18.737 --> 39:19.818
It's done.

39:20.304 --> 39:21.848
You know, we can't really change it.

39:21.849 --> 39:25.557
We can't undo feelings you
felt any more than I can.

39:26.934 --> 39:28.627
But if you don't want to do this,

39:28.982 --> 39:31.726
if you think that it's wrong,
then stop talking about it

39:31.727 --> 39:33.315
and stop torturing yourself,

39:33.316 --> 39:35.308
stop torturing me.

39:36.033 --> 39:37.429
You really want to walk away...

39:39.806 --> 39:41.529
Then go, walk away.

39:43.325 --> 39:45.036
Or at least let me.

40:07.824 --> 40:09.484
Thank you for last night.

40:09.725 --> 40:10.588
Mm.

40:11.562 --> 40:12.961
And for understanding.

40:14.414 --> 40:17.270
But... you know that Cate and Lux

40:17.271 --> 40:20.034
are the only people that
I have a relationship with.

40:21.202 --> 40:23.830
I mean, I'd like to have one with you.

40:25.681 --> 40:29.359
That is, if you can get over
the worst first date ever.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.277
Did you notice?

40:32.504 --> 40:33.575
Our seat.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.266
What time's therapy tomorrow?

40:50.552 --> 40:52.562
5:00, I think.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.328
I'll be there.

41:18.218 --> 41:19.271
I can't.

41:20.136 --> 41:21.533
I won't, actually.

41:22.427 --> 41:23.440
What?

41:24.626 --> 41:26.353
Let you go.

41:27.478 --> 41:32.478
