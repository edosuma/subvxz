03:52.058 --> 03:53.558
One way or another,

03:53.592 --> 03:54.961
and you're gonna be
wondering if it's yours.

03:54.994 --> 03:56.394

04:05.638 --> 04:08.174

- Dude, all I'm saying is that

04:08.207 --> 04:10.542
I'll get her a little puppy,

04:10.575 --> 04:12.577

- That's what you think.

04:12.611 --> 04:14.046
I already to, as soon as
she sees her friends

04:14.080 --> 04:16.916
popping out a couple,
she's gonna want one of her own.

04:16.949 --> 04:19.484
It's what always happens.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.821
It's not gonna happen.

04:21.854 --> 04:23.155
Ah, dammit.

04:23.189 --> 04:25.958
She invited him?

04:25.992 --> 04:29.061

What are you doing here?

05:09.936 --> 05:13.571
What's the matter,
you got shit in your ears?

05:13.605 --> 05:15.573
What is that?

05:15.607 --> 05:18.644
Some cliché bad-guy shit

You come back here again,

05:28.821 --> 05:30.823

Hey.

Is everything okay?

Yeah.

He's a nice guy, that's all.

05:55.848 --> 05:58.784

- No, he's not.

06:00.686 --> 06:02.288

Babe, I just got you this.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.059
What the fuck are you doing?

08:21.961 --> 08:23.229
Guess they were right about you.

08:25.131 --> 08:28.000
No!

08:30.035 --> 08:31.437
Guess the witch hunt's over now.

08:50.089 --> 08:51.957
What?

08:51.991 --> 08:53.692
What is this?

08:55.928 --> 08:57.963
grunting

10:03.829 --> 10:06.465
Serves you right
for never wanting to teach me.

10:06.498 --> 10:10.002
For fuck's sake, Henry,
you know I couldn't do that.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.939
I'll go easy on it.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.275
But, you know what happens to us
when we stop using.

10:16.308 --> 10:19.912
All right,
but it always backfires.

10:19.945 --> 10:21.247
That rarely happens.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.983
Then, why are you
here again, Xander?

10:24.016 --> 10:26.518
I missed my friend.

10:29.855 --> 10:33.425
Look, this is just who I am.

10:33.459 --> 10:36.362
It's not like
I ever made the news.

10:36.395 --> 10:38.831
Whatever, dude, goodnight.

10:38.864 --> 10:41.066
I'm not involved,
and I have to be up

10:41.100 --> 10:42.401
for work in the morning.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.171
"Oh, I have to be up
for work in the morning.

10:46.205 --> 10:48.040
I have a job, I can make money,

10:48.073 --> 10:51.076
I'm not a witch-guy, no, no."

10:51.110 --> 10:53.112
Time out.

11:02.121 --> 11:06.225
I am the Lord, when I lay
my vengeance upon you.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.894
Man or woman,

11:08.927 --> 11:10.596
oh, there's a spiritualist

11:10.630 --> 11:13.365
or medium among you.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.934
He must die.

11:15.968 --> 11:18.937
You ought to stone them.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.473
Their blood will be
upon their hands.

11:23.208 --> 11:24.510
I'm talking to you.

11:26.612 --> 11:29.014
Yes, you, Xander Perkins.

11:29.048 --> 11:31.050
You old sinner heathen.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.152
Witch.

11:33.185 --> 11:34.553
Witch.

11:34.586 --> 11:36.388
Witch!

11:40.326 --> 11:42.261
Oh, God, Henry!

11:42.294 --> 11:44.129
Henry!

11:46.298 --> 11:48.467
Thou shall not suffer
a witch to live.

11:54.373 --> 11:56.175
- Witch, witch, witch, witch...
- Witch, witch, witch, witch...

11:56.208 --> 11:58.177
Henry, no, Henry!

12:18.063 --> 12:20.366
Look, man, I don't have it.

12:20.399 --> 12:23.502
No, I can't.

12:23.535 --> 12:26.472
Well, what do you want me
to say, tell you that I...?

12:26.505 --> 12:28.273
Look, I'm gonna have to
call you back, all right?

12:28.307 --> 12:29.541
Mhm, bye.

12:32.244 --> 12:34.113
What are you doing?

12:34.146 --> 12:36.248
I need you to help me out.

12:36.281 --> 12:39.652
You're right, I think I have to
give up black magic.

12:39.686 --> 12:42.187
At least for a little while.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.590
Wow, cold turkey and all?

12:44.623 --> 12:47.159
Can you just help me out, Henry?

13:06.478 --> 13:08.580
All right, man, I'll see ya.

13:08.614 --> 13:10.015
See ya.

13:10.048 --> 13:11.383

Oh, yeah, yeah,

15:02.762 --> 15:04.162
What are you doing?

15:08.635 --> 15:10.302
You know, now that
you're not using,

15:10.335 --> 15:11.771

a new way to make money.

15:11.804 --> 15:14.206
Oh, you mean like get a job?

15:14.239 --> 15:17.175
The diner's looking for help.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.512
Yeah, right.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.649
Do you want a place
to crash or not?

15:26.485 --> 15:28.320
Are you serious?

16:05.257 --> 16:07.159
What's up, Veronica?

16:07.192 --> 16:10.262
- Long time.
- I just saw you in Biology.

16:10.295 --> 16:12.699
You know what I mean.

16:12.732 --> 16:14.499
Anyways, how's your story going?

16:14.533 --> 16:16.769
Um, pretty well actually, yeah.

16:16.803 --> 16:19.438
Yeah, you know actually Roland's
writing this really cool story.

16:19.471 --> 16:22.207
Oh, sick, that's dope.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.176
Can you fuck off?

16:29.181 --> 16:31.416
- Conrad.
- What?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.452
What, he's lurking, it's creepy.

16:34.954 --> 16:36.756
So, what are you doing for prom?

16:36.789 --> 16:38.490
I don't know yet.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.362
- I can get us a limo.
- Oh, a limo.

16:43.395 --> 16:44.897
You won't regret it.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.568
I'll think about it.

16:49.601 --> 16:51.169
Sounds good.

16:51.203 --> 16:53.205
Um, anyways, I've gotta go.

16:53.238 --> 16:55.642
Big sister duty
and everything, so.

17:02.547 --> 17:04.651
Woo.

17:04.684 --> 17:07.854
I'm totally gonna tap that ass.

17:07.887 --> 17:10.923
Because that's just
a thing that people say.

17:10.957 --> 17:13.525
Yes, they do.

17:13.558 --> 17:14.961
Waiter.

17:14.994 --> 17:17.229
Waiter, waiter!

17:17.262 --> 17:20.232
- Yeah, sorry, guys.
- Can we please get some service?

17:20.265 --> 17:21.768
Sorry about that, guys,
I'm sorry.

17:21.801 --> 17:23.502
All right, what can I get ya?

17:23.535 --> 17:25.672
Well, I was actually

17:25.705 --> 17:27.740

17:27.774 --> 17:29.809
- a blowjob.
- Yeah.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.744
From your mom.

17:31.778 --> 17:33.646
That's funny, guys.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.748
Maybe some
scrambled eggs and milk.

17:37.684 --> 17:39.384
Is that you, Xander?

17:40.953 --> 17:42.621
- I am.
- All right, cool.

17:44.389 --> 17:46.258
You got any experience?

17:46.291 --> 17:47.627
None.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.996
- You like working with people?
- Nope.

17:50.029 --> 17:52.197
Can you wash dishes?

17:53.966 --> 17:56.769
- I guess.
- Great, you start tomorrow.

18:14.754 --> 18:17.857
Come on, kid, what are you
waiting for, Halloween?

18:17.890 --> 18:21.393
Dude, I'm seriously
doing my best over here.

18:21.426 --> 18:23.996
Well, use soap and water,
it's not that hard.

18:50.957 --> 18:53.525
Careful.

18:53.558 --> 18:55.027
Sorry, but if...
if Frank catches you,

18:55.061 --> 18:56.963
- he's gonna lose his shit.
- Oh.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.067
Well, Frank can kiss my ass.

19:10.009 --> 19:12.477
I'm Roland.

19:12.511 --> 19:14.312
Xander.

19:14.346 --> 19:15.547
You work here long?

19:15.580 --> 19:16.983
About a year, it's okay.

19:17.016 --> 19:18.517
It's my first day,
and I'd rather

19:18.550 --> 19:20.552
pick pieces of corn out of shit.

19:23.055 --> 19:24.991
You get used to it.

19:25.024 --> 19:27.325
Can hardly wait.

19:29.028 --> 19:31.429
I'm... I'm gonna go back inside.

19:37.103 --> 19:38.704
Hey, Roland.

19:38.738 --> 19:40.605
Yeah?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.474
You know you ought to tell
those guys that bother you

19:42.507 --> 19:45.610
to go fuck themselves?

19:45.645 --> 19:48.446
Thanks, but I sorta
don't wanna die.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.468
Well, that looks disgusting.

20:10.502 --> 20:11.871
- Do you wanna do the cooking?
- No,

20:11.904 --> 20:13.072
that is your responsibility.

20:15.842 --> 20:17.677
Conrad, grab me one
while you're at it, huh?

20:17.710 --> 20:19.145
Yep.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.648
- Thanks.
- Mhm.

20:24.583 --> 20:25.852
So, coach thinks
I have a pretty chance

20:25.885 --> 20:27.586
impressing the scouts
next month.

20:29.454 --> 20:31.123
Well, don't screw it up, okay?

20:33.558 --> 20:34.894
Thanks, Uncle Fred.

20:34.927 --> 20:37.063
- Thank you for your support.
- Hey, listen,

20:37.096 --> 20:38.931
you wanna get out
of this shithole town?

20:38.965 --> 20:40.867
This is it, I mean it.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.935
Don't screw it up.

20:56.983 --> 20:58.985
$380!

21:01.120 --> 21:02.822
Oh, thank you!

21:02.855 --> 21:05.490
Honey, are you ready to meet
that new challenger?

21:08.694 --> 21:10.630
Hey, Dad.

21:10.663 --> 21:14.100
Let's bring in that
new mystery challenger.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.057
But, you know what happens to us
when we stop using.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.725
God.

22:15.227 --> 22:16.594
Ow.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.238
Oh, God!

22:26.272 --> 22:28.240
Fuck, God.

22:28.274 --> 22:29.942
Fuck!

22:48.627 --> 22:50.595
Let me get another.

22:50.629 --> 22:52.932
I think you've had enough, pal.

22:52.965 --> 22:55.668
Come on, lady, just one more.

22:59.105 --> 23:00.806
Whatever.

23:06.078 --> 23:07.680
Hey, beautiful.

23:09.315 --> 23:12.118
I'm Xander.

23:14.053 --> 23:16.789
Melissa.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.958
Can I get you another...?

23:18.991 --> 23:20.760
What are you drinking?

23:20.793 --> 23:23.796
Excuse me.

23:23.829 --> 23:26.232
- What?
- You're in my seat, dickhead.

23:29.601 --> 23:32.671
Oh, I'm in your seat.

23:32.705 --> 23:34.073
My bad.

23:34.106 --> 23:36.574
Yeah, so get lost.

23:36.608 --> 23:38.978
Look, man, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

23:39.011 --> 23:41.213
I was just having
a friendly conversation

23:41.247 --> 23:44.316
with Melissa over here and...

23:44.350 --> 23:46.986
you know,
next drink's on me, huh?

23:47.019 --> 23:50.089
Hey, can I get another beer
over here for my, uh...

23:50.122 --> 23:53.092
- my handsome friend.
- Fuck you.

23:53.125 --> 23:55.261
We're leaving, let's go.

23:55.294 --> 23:58.130
I'm not ready.

24:10.743 --> 24:12.645
What's wrong?

24:12.678 --> 24:14.680
Hey, um,

24:14.713 --> 24:16.782
can you turn the air on in here?

24:16.816 --> 24:18.017
It's on.

24:22.321 --> 24:24.190
Do you need to step outside?

24:24.223 --> 24:25.658
Uh.

24:25.691 --> 24:27.726
Um, shut up, I'm fine.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.628
You don't sound too fine.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.299
Babe, what is it?

24:33.332 --> 24:35.067
I don't know.

24:35.101 --> 24:36.402
- Did you do this to me?
- What the fuck

24:36.435 --> 24:38.337
are you talking about?

24:39.972 --> 24:41.874
Oh, God.

24:46.745 --> 24:48.180
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

24:48.214 --> 24:51.250
Oh, what are you doing?

24:51.283 --> 24:53.319
Stop it, ugh!

24:53.352 --> 24:55.754
No!

25:02.695 --> 25:04.864
Oh, that's disgusting!

25:04.897 --> 25:07.099
What the hell?

25:09.969 --> 25:12.738
Hey.

25:12.771 --> 25:15.908
I know a really good
dermatologist.

25:15.941 --> 25:17.843
Did you do that?

25:20.279 --> 25:22.815
Oh, my God.

25:22.848 --> 25:24.383
That's so hot.

25:29.855 --> 25:32.224
Whoa, whoa, wait.

25:32.258 --> 25:34.126
Here.

25:51.477 --> 25:53.312
Dad.

25:56.815 --> 26:00.186
You're starting to stink.

26:03.088 --> 26:06.125
I'm just saying,
it wouldn't hurt to try.

26:06.158 --> 26:07.826
I'm trying.

26:07.860 --> 26:10.963
I am.

26:10.996 --> 26:13.098
Then, when are you
gonna go back to work?

26:15.868 --> 26:18.504
I will.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.406
Just need some time.

26:20.439 --> 26:23.242
It's been almost two years, Dad.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.844
She left me, too.

26:25.878 --> 26:27.446
Yeah, I know.

26:30.783 --> 26:32.985
Like, I just need some time.

26:43.996 --> 26:46.098
Can we at least
get rid of that thing?

26:48.534 --> 26:51.103
- Why?
- It's weird.

26:51.136 --> 26:53.772
It's cute.

26:53.806 --> 26:56.175
Whatever.

26:56.208 --> 26:59.812
She got that for me
in West Virginia.

26:59.845 --> 27:01.280
It's precious.

27:32.544 --> 27:34.580
What happened?

27:34.613 --> 27:36.448
A street fight.

27:36.482 --> 27:39.585
Mysterious.

27:39.618 --> 27:42.054
Let me get your number.

27:42.087 --> 27:43.956
Why?

27:43.989 --> 27:45.591
So, we can talk later.

27:48.994 --> 27:51.864
I don't know.

27:51.897 --> 27:54.366
I'm not really
quite sure how I feel

27:54.400 --> 27:57.936
about women that are...

27:57.970 --> 28:00.139
into face melting.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.009
- Get the fuck out!
- Oh, all right!

28:04.043 --> 28:07.846
Go, stupid asshole!

28:09.882 --> 28:11.917
Yeah, that girl
never texted me back.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.285
They just don't do that anymore.

28:14.953 --> 28:16.855
Oh, shit, watch this,
watch this, watch this.

28:16.889 --> 28:18.257
- Watch.
- Ahh!

28:18.290 --> 28:20.392
Ohh!

28:20.426 --> 28:22.094
Yes.

28:22.127 --> 28:25.264
Yes, clean up on aisle douche.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.469
Hey.

28:30.502 --> 28:33.439
- You okay, bud?
- Uh, you... you okay, buddy?

28:33.472 --> 28:35.074
You okay?

28:35.107 --> 28:36.575
Ah, he's all right,
he's all right, he's good.

28:36.608 --> 28:38.177
He's good.

28:45.484 --> 28:46.952
You Conrad?

28:48.688 --> 28:51.023
Can I help you?

28:51.056 --> 28:53.225
How are those sores
on your dick?

28:53.258 --> 28:56.663
If it still hurts to pee,
I know a good urologist.

28:56.696 --> 28:58.497
Yo, who is this guy?

28:58.530 --> 29:00.899
I don't know.

29:00.933 --> 29:03.502
I mean, what were you thinking
messing around with that chick

29:03.535 --> 29:06.438
in her parents' basement
last year before Christmas?

29:06.472 --> 29:08.173
You gotta
wrap that shit up, dude.

29:25.624 --> 29:29.328
You really shouldn't
stigmatize STIs like that.

29:39.639 --> 29:42.608
Hey, Roland right?

29:44.711 --> 29:46.245
You need a ride?

29:48.681 --> 29:50.382
Come on.

29:52.418 --> 29:54.553
Hey, thanks for
helping me out today.

29:54.586 --> 29:57.022
Don't worry about it, man,
happy to help.

29:59.391 --> 30:01.960
Do you wanna come in?

30:01.994 --> 30:04.229
Nah, I got a lot of stuff
to do today.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.598
Yeah, oh yeah, totally.

30:06.633 --> 30:08.534
I just thought it might be fun
to play video games or whatever,

30:08.567 --> 30:11.336
but you know what,
never mind, doesn't matter.

30:11.370 --> 30:12.705
I will see you tomorrow.

30:15.574 --> 30:18.645
You know what, why not?

30:18.678 --> 30:20.312
Yeah?

30:20.345 --> 30:22.181
Sure thing.

30:22.214 --> 30:24.316
Okay, awesome.

30:27.085 --> 30:29.722
So, you got any booze
in here or what?

30:29.756 --> 30:31.623
Uh, my dad does.

30:31.658 --> 30:34.727
- Where's your dad?
- He's probably at a bar.

30:34.761 --> 30:36.295
Perfect.

30:38.230 --> 30:40.700
What?

30:40.733 --> 30:43.168
You're kinda being a shitty host
right now, you know?

30:43.202 --> 30:46.305
I can't give you my dad's beer.

30:46.338 --> 30:47.674
Come on.

30:47.707 --> 30:50.375
Yeah, I'll take care of it,
it'll be okay.

30:50.409 --> 30:51.778
Go.

30:51.811 --> 30:54.079
Go, go.

30:56.716 --> 30:58.617
Hey, by the way,

30:58.651 --> 31:00.753
that Veronica chick,

31:00.787 --> 31:02.588
she's pretty hot.

31:02.621 --> 31:05.324
I know.

31:05.357 --> 31:08.527
So, why aren't you... you know?

31:11.263 --> 31:13.499
Yeah, right.

31:17.569 --> 31:20.405
My man.

31:23.342 --> 31:25.410
Nice.

31:29.515 --> 31:31.283
Oh, I'm good, thank you.

31:34.453 --> 31:37.055
Uh, Roland.

31:37.089 --> 31:38.490
Take the beer.

31:41.093 --> 31:43.061
Thank you.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.165
Cheers.

31:47.199 --> 31:48.467
Yeah.

31:52.705 --> 31:56.308
Oh, that's disgusting.

31:58.878 --> 32:02.514
What the fuck is that thing?

32:12.224 --> 32:14.727
What is this, an owl?

32:14.761 --> 32:16.595
It's... it's my dad's owl.

32:16.629 --> 32:18.597
Can you just...
can you put it down please?

32:24.503 --> 32:26.171
Shit.

32:29.842 --> 32:32.611
I'm sorry, man.

32:32.645 --> 32:34.446
Oh, my dad is gonna freak.

32:36.649 --> 32:38.317
My mom got that for him
on their honeymoon

32:38.350 --> 32:40.820
- in West Virginia.
- West Virginia?

32:43.522 --> 32:46.325
Look, man, it's okay,

32:46.358 --> 32:48.160
I can fix this.

32:48.193 --> 32:49.595
I swear, uh... look, look,

32:49.629 --> 32:52.130
do you have anything
that belonged to your mom

32:52.164 --> 32:54.266
made of cloth, or...?

32:56.903 --> 32:59.371
Yeah, I got something.

32:59.404 --> 33:01.206
- Oh, yeah, this'll work.
- Yeah, it's the towel

33:01.239 --> 33:02.775
my mom used to dry herself with.

33:02.809 --> 33:05.577
My dad doesn't wanna wash it.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.512
Gross.

33:10.449 --> 33:13.318
All right.

33:13.352 --> 33:15.520
Okay.

33:32.437 --> 33:34.573
Oh, but, how'd...?

33:39.311 --> 33:41.213
Are you a magician?

33:43.215 --> 33:46.385
Roland,

33:46.418 --> 33:47.954
I'm a witch.

33:47.987 --> 33:49.956
- What, a warlock?
- No.

33:49.989 --> 33:53.392
- A witch.
- Oh, uh, a wizard.

33:53.425 --> 33:55.628
No.

33:55.662 --> 33:59.197
I said, "A witch."

33:59.231 --> 34:02.401
But, no, no way,
that's not possible.

34:02.434 --> 34:04.236
How did you do this?

34:04.269 --> 34:05.537
Can you just... can you get it?

34:05.570 --> 34:07.674
I'm a witch, okay, huh?

34:07.707 --> 34:09.408
Bullshit.

34:09.441 --> 34:11.576
No bullshit.

34:14.881 --> 34:17.315
What the hell, dude?

34:17.349 --> 34:19.551
I just wanted to see
if you'd melt.

34:21.788 --> 34:23.455
Come here.

34:23.488 --> 34:25.992
Hey, I need those, I need...

34:27.727 --> 34:30.362
- Ahh.
- I got news for ya, pal.

34:30.395 --> 34:32.264
Wait until tomorrow.

34:32.297 --> 34:33.666
You're not gonna need 'em then.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.902
What am I supposed to
read with tonight?

34:37.970 --> 34:40.940
Do yourself a favor,
watch some porn.

35:28.654 --> 35:30.890
Xander, hey, Xander.

35:30.923 --> 35:34.727
I can see... I mean, I can see
without my glasses on.

35:34.761 --> 35:36.829
Yeah.

35:36.863 --> 35:38.396
Whoa.

35:38.430 --> 35:39.866
You really are a witch.

35:39.899 --> 35:43.002
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

35:43.035 --> 35:45.004
So, I still don't get it,
why are you called a witch,

35:45.037 --> 35:47.506
or not a wizard or a warlock?

35:47.539 --> 35:50.609
Listen, man,
why is the zebra called a zebra,

35:50.643 --> 35:53.045
and not just a horse
with fucking stripes?

35:56.381 --> 35:57.750
Look, I...

35:57.784 --> 36:01.687
I'm only telling you this
because, frankly,

36:01.721 --> 36:03.588
I was like you once.

36:03.622 --> 36:06.993
- Like me?
- Yeah, a virgin.

36:07.026 --> 36:09.829
Okay, I can't really explain
the feeling that you get

36:09.862 --> 36:12.597
when you cast a spell, but...

36:12.632 --> 36:14.432
it's the best.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.035
It's better than sex.

36:16.068 --> 36:19.404
This is why I need this
to stay between you and me,

36:19.437 --> 36:21.741
because if my roommate
finds out about this,

36:21.774 --> 36:23.341
he'll kill me.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.710
But, that's why
I'm gonna help you.

36:24.744 --> 36:26.578
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:26.611 --> 36:29.347
So, next time Conrad
comes into the diner,

36:29.381 --> 36:31.050
put that shit in his food.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.585
What'll this do to him?

36:37.857 --> 36:40.492
Pretty much
make his life miserable.

36:40.525 --> 36:41.928
Oh.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.906
Does your burger taste funny?

36:53.940 --> 36:55.741
No.

36:55.775 --> 36:57.609
All right.

36:57.643 --> 37:00.512
I can't believe I got a D
on that paper.

37:00.545 --> 37:03.015
I mean, I've never gotten
anything below a B before.

37:03.049 --> 37:04.650
Maybe you're just stupid.

37:06.418 --> 37:08.054
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me.

37:08.087 --> 37:10.990
Maybe you're just...
plain, old dumb.

37:13.059 --> 37:14.492
I mean, you're hot,
but there's just, like,

37:14.526 --> 37:15.928
not that much going on
in your head.

37:15.962 --> 37:17.495
- Dude, stop.
- What?

37:17.529 --> 37:20.666
I just... I just can't wait
to get to prom,

37:20.700 --> 37:23.035
so I can bang you
and move on with my life.

37:24.737 --> 37:26.072
Conrad, stop.

37:26.105 --> 37:28.140
I mean, then again,
according to Paul Mason,

37:28.174 --> 37:30.542
you're kinda disappointing, so.

37:38.516 --> 37:41.020
What... what... what just happened?

37:41.053 --> 37:42.788
Holy shit.

37:44.657 --> 37:45.958
- What?
- I think there's a zit

37:45.992 --> 37:48.160
on your forehead.

37:50.796 --> 37:52.765
Oh, fuck.

37:59.839 --> 38:02.074
You can forget about that whole

38:02.108 --> 38:03.676
"When you're a witch,
whatever you do

38:03.709 --> 38:06.544
comes back at you
times three" thing.

38:06.578 --> 38:07.947
It... it's bullshit.

38:56.729 --> 38:57.997
Yes!

38:59.899 --> 39:01.566
Think, ooh!

39:47.612 --> 39:49.315
You've got a beautiful smile.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.549
- Thank you.
- Yeah, but thank you.

40:12.171 --> 40:13.739
All right.

40:23.182 --> 40:24.216
Ow!

40:24.250 --> 40:26.285
Fuck!

40:27.720 --> 40:30.156
Dammit.

40:35.094 --> 40:37.363
What the hell are you doing?

40:37.396 --> 40:39.131
Uh...

40:39.165 --> 40:41.700
Nothing.

40:41.734 --> 40:42.868
PE assignment.

40:44.336 --> 40:46.105
Hm.

40:53.879 --> 40:55.613
What made you think
you could fly?

40:55.648 --> 40:57.116
I don't know.

40:57.149 --> 40:58.717
Isn't that what witches do?

40:58.751 --> 41:01.153
Roland, I can't even fly.

41:01.187 --> 41:03.089
Well, I'm an idiot.

41:03.122 --> 41:04.824
What the hell
are you doing anyway?

41:04.857 --> 41:07.860
Trying to make
a healing potion.

41:07.893 --> 41:11.197
Oh, it smells really bad.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.966
It tastes even worse,

41:13.999 --> 41:15.201
like Bigfoot's jockstrap.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.638
Down the hatch.

41:21.907 --> 41:23.175
Well?

41:24.944 --> 41:27.079
Well, I don't seem to be
hatefully shitting yet,

41:27.113 --> 41:30.149
so I guess we'll find out
tomorrow.

41:30.182 --> 41:32.118
Have you turned someone
into something else,

41:32.151 --> 41:33.219
like an object?

41:33.252 --> 41:35.354
I read this fairy tale once
called The Old Witch.

41:35.387 --> 41:36.922
It's about
this spoiled little girl

41:36.956 --> 41:39.058
who gets turned into a log
by a hag witch.

41:39.091 --> 41:41.293
I'm sorry, can I just ask you
one question?

41:41.327 --> 41:42.862
Yeah, sure.

41:44.430 --> 41:46.966
What comes to your mind
when I say the word "boob"?

41:51.971 --> 41:53.205
You answered it.

42:07.753 --> 42:09.255
I don't think
this is gonna work.

42:09.288 --> 42:12.458
- Relax, it's gonna work.
- Are you sure?

42:12.491 --> 42:15.261
I mean, you've done this
kind of thing before, right?

42:15.294 --> 42:18.030
- No.
- Xander.

42:18.063 --> 42:19.198
Hey.

42:19.231 --> 42:21.400
Have I ever steered you wrong?

42:22.735 --> 42:24.069
Yes.

42:25.471 --> 42:27.273
You don't have to be
a dick about it.

42:30.276 --> 42:33.179
- Well?
- I don't recognize the number.

42:33.212 --> 42:35.181
So, answer it then.

42:38.150 --> 42:40.286
Hello?

42:43.155 --> 42:46.025
Yeah, yeah, Veronica,
I'm still here.

42:53.432 --> 42:56.802
Conrad, what the hell
are you doing in there?

42:56.835 --> 42:58.137
Give me a minute!

42:58.170 --> 42:59.471
When are you coming out?

42:59.505 --> 43:01.941
Just give me a second.

43:10.783 --> 43:13.118
Oh, God.

43:24.797 --> 43:26.999
Okay.

43:27.032 --> 43:28.934
All right.

43:32.871 --> 43:34.340
Um, hey.

43:34.373 --> 43:37.109
Can we, uh, can we talk?

43:38.344 --> 43:40.279
There you go.

43:43.482 --> 43:46.452
So, uh, you have any trouble
finding the place?

43:46.485 --> 43:48.354
Uh, no. Why would I?

43:51.357 --> 43:52.358
You hungry?

43:55.894 --> 43:57.029
You sure?

44:01.533 --> 44:03.369
How about a movie?

44:03.402 --> 44:05.471
Listen...

44:05.504 --> 44:09.975
Um, I've been thinking a lot,

44:10.009 --> 44:12.978
um, about you.

44:13.012 --> 44:14.546
About me?

44:14.580 --> 44:19.218
Well, you're like the only guy
in school who...

44:19.251 --> 44:21.587
Who what?

44:21.620 --> 44:24.023
Who isn't a complete asshole.

44:24.056 --> 44:25.391
I don't know.

44:25.424 --> 44:28.127
Well, I do.

44:28.160 --> 44:31.530
I mean, people just...

44:31.563 --> 44:33.932
They just treat me
like the pretty girl.

44:33.966 --> 44:34.867
You are pretty.

44:34.900 --> 44:37.236
I mean, not that
that's what matters.

44:37.269 --> 44:40.205
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

44:40.239 --> 44:41.340
Relax.

44:48.080 --> 44:52.251
Um, you've, uh, you've never
done that before, have you?

44:52.284 --> 44:55.321
I mean, was it that obvious?

44:57.556 --> 45:00.459
But, listen, I'm...

45:00.492 --> 45:03.195
I'm not what they say I am.

45:03.228 --> 45:05.397
I don't believe
anything they say.

45:05.431 --> 45:06.965
I mean...

45:06.999 --> 45:09.501
Like, I've never even...

45:09.535 --> 45:13.572
Look, I know what they say
about me and it's not true.

45:16.275 --> 45:18.577
But if I were

45:18.610 --> 45:23.482
to be with someone, um...

45:25.017 --> 45:26.218
...I'd want it to be you.

45:31.090 --> 45:32.891
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

45:32.925 --> 45:34.159
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry, Veronica,

45:34.193 --> 45:35.627
this is a mistake,
you need to go.

45:35.662 --> 45:38.464
- But, Roland...
- Just go.

45:41.533 --> 45:43.902
Fuck.

46:06.358 --> 46:09.094
What are you doing?

46:09.128 --> 46:10.697
Look what you left out.

46:10.730 --> 46:13.165
Mastering the Art
of Sex Spells.

46:13.198 --> 46:16.402
- Classy.
- Oh, shit, man.

46:16.435 --> 46:18.170
How's it working for ya?

46:18.203 --> 46:21.306
- I'm not using it, I swear.
- No?

46:21.340 --> 46:23.208
No, I met this kid
named Roland,

46:23.242 --> 46:25.577
and he reminded me
of how we were in high school.

46:25.611 --> 46:28.046
What? Roland? Roland Grimm?

46:28.080 --> 46:29.682
- Yeah.
- Fuck you, man.

46:29.716 --> 46:32.117
I was nothing like that kid
in high school.

46:32.151 --> 46:34.953
I was just trying
to help him out.

46:34.987 --> 46:36.955
You know, with all the bullies

46:36.989 --> 46:39.591
and the other joys
of being a teenager?

46:39.625 --> 46:41.694
What is this,
Revenge of the Witches?

46:41.728 --> 46:42.662
You made a deal with me

46:42.695 --> 46:44.496
you weren't gonna use
that shit anymore.

46:44.530 --> 46:47.132
I'm not using,
I'm just teaching him.

46:47.166 --> 46:50.002
What happened to
witchcraft can't be taught?

46:52.137 --> 46:53.706
Henry...

46:53.740 --> 46:55.708
Henry, he can handle it.

46:57.142 --> 46:58.977
You weren't ready.

46:59.011 --> 47:00.647
Who always had your back
in high school?

47:00.680 --> 47:02.181
You did, and I appreciated...

47:02.214 --> 47:03.482
And I appreciate you
telling me

47:03.515 --> 47:06.051
how to be responsible,
you fucking psycho.

47:06.084 --> 47:08.487
Henry, I need you to trust me.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.490
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up?

47:11.523 --> 47:13.726
You're full of shit, Xander.

47:21.033 --> 47:23.168
Witch.

47:23.202 --> 47:26.238
Witch, witch,
witch, witch, witch.

47:26.271 --> 47:28.440
Witch!

47:45.057 --> 47:46.458
Oh, uh, hey.

47:46.492 --> 47:48.293
Hey. You got a minute?

47:48.327 --> 47:50.697
Um, sure.

47:56.068 --> 47:58.771
So, Roland,
this is my brother, Jack.

47:58.805 --> 48:01.674
- Stepbrother.
- Oh, shut up.

48:01.708 --> 48:04.243
Nice to meet you, Jack.

48:04.276 --> 48:07.513
- So, what's up?
- Um...

48:13.085 --> 48:15.587
I just wanted to apologize
for this past weekend.

48:15.621 --> 48:17.724
What are you talking about?

48:17.757 --> 48:20.760
Um, you came to my house

48:20.793 --> 48:23.362
and we, uh, did things.

48:23.395 --> 48:25.464
Well, I mean,
we almost did things.

48:25.497 --> 48:27.299
Roland, are...

48:27.332 --> 48:29.601
Are you on drugs?

48:29.636 --> 48:31.638
No, seriously, are you?

48:34.206 --> 48:36.809
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

48:36.843 --> 48:39.545
Um, I know the answer
is probably no

48:39.578 --> 48:40.847
and you already have a date,

48:40.880 --> 48:43.016
but do you want
to go to prom with me?

48:55.728 --> 48:57.697
Dude...

48:57.730 --> 49:00.198
What happened?

49:00.232 --> 49:01.834
What am I supposed to do, man?

49:01.868 --> 49:04.737
I can't play like this
on Saturday.

49:10.242 --> 49:11.243
Shit.

49:13.846 --> 49:16.816
I used to be so hot.

49:16.849 --> 49:19.752
So, I guess right now
is not a good time

49:19.786 --> 49:21.587
to tell you about Grimm.

49:21.620 --> 49:24.156
What about that piece of shit?

49:25.892 --> 49:27.559
He's taking Veronica to prom.

49:31.296 --> 49:33.198
You okay?

49:35.534 --> 49:38.337
Do me a favor?

49:38.370 --> 49:39.739
Kick his ass.

50:06.598 --> 50:09.902
- Morning, Son.
- Dad, hey.

50:09.936 --> 50:11.403
Oh, I better get going.

50:11.436 --> 50:13.538
I don't want to be late
for my interview.

50:13.572 --> 50:16.241
You have an interview?

50:16.274 --> 50:17.442
You have a good day
at school.

50:17.476 --> 50:19.211
I'll see you when I get home.

50:19.244 --> 50:20.780
Yeah, okay.

50:27.754 --> 50:28.921
Hans? What are you...

50:35.360 --> 50:38.698
- What's this?
- Hans, give it back. Please!

50:38.731 --> 50:40.667
Conrad is gonna love this.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.635
Hans, stop!

51:08.326 --> 51:09.862
Hey, buddy. What's up?

51:09.896 --> 51:11.798
Hans found out we're witches.

51:13.598 --> 51:16.368
Hey, Conrad, call me back
as soon as you get this.

51:16.401 --> 51:17.637
It's about Grimm.

51:17.670 --> 51:20.707
He's into
some voodoo-type shit.

51:28.580 --> 51:32.652
"Give yourself a bigger penis."

51:34.619 --> 51:36.689
What the fuck?

51:47.834 --> 51:50.036
Hans, buddy.

51:50.069 --> 51:51.536
- No.
- Wait, wait, wait.

51:51.570 --> 51:52.805
Come on.

51:54.372 --> 51:55.808
What do you want?

51:55.842 --> 51:59.045
We have a little proposal
for you.

51:59.078 --> 52:00.345
Fine.

52:02.514 --> 52:04.650
You know you're not
getting the book.

52:04.684 --> 52:07.887
I'm telling the whole school
about you.

52:07.920 --> 52:11.490
Here's the thing, Hans,
you give us our book back,

52:11.523 --> 52:12.792
we'll help you out.

52:12.825 --> 52:15.795
You help me?

52:15.828 --> 52:19.331
I'm kind of like
the Al Capone of witches.

52:19.364 --> 52:21.801
- Who?
- Never mind.

52:21.834 --> 52:23.836
Look, do you really want
Conrad to know

52:23.870 --> 52:26.605
that you hooked up
with Kristy Becker last year?

52:26.639 --> 52:28.941
- What?
- Do you also want him to know

52:28.975 --> 52:31.610
that you secretly hate him

52:31.644 --> 52:35.313
'cause he gets more attention
from the girls at the parties?

52:35.347 --> 52:36.548
Don't lie to me.

52:36.581 --> 52:38.350
You daydream about his face

52:38.383 --> 52:40.653
getting run over
by a tractor-trailer.

52:42.387 --> 52:46.025
Granted, I think
you're slightly more handsome,

52:46.058 --> 52:48.728
but that's just
my humble opinion.

52:48.761 --> 52:51.998
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

52:53.365 --> 52:55.001
Oh, oh!

52:56.869 --> 52:58.771
That's cool, man.

52:58.805 --> 53:01.040
Damn, I didn't know.

53:01.073 --> 53:02.809
What?

53:04.977 --> 53:08.014
You think about Conrad
sometimes when you jerk off?

53:11.017 --> 53:13.518
All right, get the fuck
out of my house.

53:13.552 --> 53:16.088
All right, calm down.

53:16.122 --> 53:17.723
We're just here to help.

53:19.659 --> 53:23.129
This will solve
all of your insecurities.

53:23.162 --> 53:24.797
Who said I was insecure?

53:24.831 --> 53:27.099
Witchcraft, Hans. Witchcraft.

53:27.133 --> 53:29.635
And if you drink this,
then all the girls

53:29.669 --> 53:31.971
and the guys
will find you irresistible,

53:32.004 --> 53:36.075
and I mean like, "Oh my God,
there goes Hans, he's so hot.

53:36.108 --> 53:40.847
I just want to lick
the stinky, smelly sweat

53:40.880 --> 53:42.815
out of his armpits."

53:46.551 --> 53:48.154
What's the catch?

53:48.187 --> 53:50.555
You give us the book

53:50.589 --> 53:53.458
and keep your mouth shut.

53:53.491 --> 53:55.094
Deal.

54:05.137 --> 54:07.539
What's it supposed
to do to him?

54:07.572 --> 54:10.609
He's supposed
to forget everything.

54:15.648 --> 54:17.183
Is it working?

54:17.216 --> 54:19.517
'Cause I feel like shit.

54:54.020 --> 54:56.722
Are you sure
you did that right?

54:56.756 --> 54:59.491
I mean, I did snort some blow

54:59.524 --> 55:02.995
before I made the potion,
but, yeah.

55:03.029 --> 55:05.131
- Seriously?
- No.

55:05.164 --> 55:08.935
How irresponsible
do you think I am?

55:08.968 --> 55:11.603
- Just a little weed, though.
- Xander!

55:21.881 --> 55:23.249
What happened to him?

55:25.985 --> 55:28.054
Hell if I know.

55:32.858 --> 55:35.560
Nice going, fairy godmother.

55:35.593 --> 55:37.863
I'll keep him quiet at least.

55:37.897 --> 55:40.633
No, we have to turn him back.

55:40.666 --> 55:42.768
Do we really?

55:42.802 --> 55:44.637
Yes, I mean, I hate him too,

55:44.670 --> 55:46.772
but we can't
keep him like this.

55:46.806 --> 55:49.709
There is a way
to reverse this, right?

55:49.742 --> 55:51.110
Yeah, I guess.

55:51.143 --> 55:52.577
It's just a lot of work.

55:52.610 --> 55:53.713
Okay, then let's go.

56:04.991 --> 56:06.125
Oh, fuck.

56:10.162 --> 56:12.665
Oh, shit!

56:12.698 --> 56:15.234
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

56:15.267 --> 56:17.837
Yeah, no, he's dead.

56:17.870 --> 56:19.205
Oh, shit.

56:19.238 --> 56:21.007
Xander, what do we do?

56:21.040 --> 56:23.541
I don't know.

56:23.575 --> 56:25.610
We...

56:25.644 --> 56:26.812
We just killed someone!

56:26.846 --> 56:28.314
Hey, hey.

56:30.082 --> 56:32.051
Let's get it together, huh?

56:32.084 --> 56:33.753
Let's think of something here.

56:33.786 --> 56:35.620
When do his parents come home?

56:35.654 --> 56:36.521
We can clean all this shit up

56:36.554 --> 56:39.557
and nobody will know
anything happened.

56:39.591 --> 56:41.593
No, no, we have
to bring him back.

56:41.626 --> 56:42.762
We have to bring him back.

56:42.795 --> 56:44.997
Roland, we can't
bring him back.

56:45.031 --> 56:45.965
Yeah, but I mean,
we're witches.

56:45.998 --> 56:47.333
We can do anything, right?

56:47.366 --> 56:50.069
Buddy...

56:50.102 --> 56:52.872
We can't bring him back.

56:52.905 --> 56:55.775
And if we did, we wouldn't
be doing him any favors.

56:58.144 --> 56:59.912
He'd come back as a monster.

57:05.617 --> 57:06.752
Oh, shit.

57:06.786 --> 57:09.155
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

57:12.224 --> 57:15.627
- Are you good with a shovel?
- What?

57:22.068 --> 57:23.769
That's good.

57:24.937 --> 57:26.672
No way, man, I ca... I can't.

58:00.139 --> 58:02.241
You need to relax, Roland.

58:04.310 --> 58:06.178
We're so fucked.

58:10.216 --> 58:12.284
We just killed someone.

58:12.318 --> 58:13.886
I know, man.

58:15.421 --> 58:18.224
But think about it.

58:18.257 --> 58:21.093
Hans was just gonna end up
being some serial killer

58:21.127 --> 58:24.296
or a rapist anyway,
so it's fine.

58:24.330 --> 58:26.332
Xander, stop it.

58:28.033 --> 58:31.837
I don't think we should be
witches anymore.

58:31.871 --> 58:35.307
What we did to Hans
was really wrong.

58:37.076 --> 58:38.811
I know.

58:38.844 --> 58:40.312
I know, man,
but it was a mistake.

58:40.346 --> 58:42.748
Yeah, okay,
so no more witchcraft.

58:42.781 --> 58:45.251
At least not for a while.

58:45.284 --> 58:47.052
Xander?

58:51.790 --> 58:53.459
All right, man.

58:53.492 --> 58:56.662
No more witchcraft.

59:05.938 --> 59:08.807
Conrad, get it together.

59:08.841 --> 59:10.242
I'm not playing this weekend.

59:10.276 --> 59:11.744
Are you kidding?

59:11.777 --> 59:14.413
I feel like complete shit.

59:14.446 --> 59:16.815
So we'll go to the doctor.

59:16.849 --> 59:19.818
Uncle Fred, look at me.

59:21.020 --> 59:22.021
I can't play like this.

59:29.161 --> 59:31.897
Hey, Conrad, call me back
as soon as you get this.

59:31.931 --> 59:33.199
It's about Grimm.

59:33.232 --> 59:35.901
He's into
some voodoo-type shit.

59:37.069 --> 59:39.338
What's that all about?

59:39.371 --> 59:42.741
He's probably just drunk
or something.

1:00:06.098 --> 1:00:08.467
Hey.

1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:10.869
So, how's your story going?

1:00:10.903 --> 1:00:12.204
It's okay.

1:00:12.238 --> 1:00:13.839
Kind of taking a break
from it right now.

1:00:13.872 --> 1:00:15.507
Why? It sounded interesting.

1:00:15.541 --> 1:00:17.910
There's better things
to write about than witches.

1:00:17.943 --> 1:00:19.912
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1:00:19.945 --> 1:00:23.382
Vampires, werewolves,
psycho soccer moms.

1:00:23.415 --> 1:00:25.818
You know, my mom
was a psycho soccer mom?

1:00:25.851 --> 1:00:27.119
- Really.
- Mm-hm,

1:00:27.152 --> 1:00:29.321
even though I hated soccer.

1:00:29.355 --> 1:00:31.123
I'd always get hit in the face
with the ball

1:00:31.156 --> 1:00:32.424
and everyone
would laugh at me,

1:00:32.458 --> 1:00:33.392
and I was like, you know what,

1:00:33.425 --> 1:00:36.061
"This is why I'll stick
with cheerleading."

1:00:36.095 --> 1:00:38.464
- You're good at other things.
- Oh, yeah?

1:00:38.497 --> 1:00:40.032
Yeah, I remember freshman year
when Andrea Queen

1:00:40.065 --> 1:00:41.100
called you a whore
and you gave her

1:00:41.133 --> 1:00:42.968
two black eyes.

1:00:43.002 --> 1:00:46.138
So I'm good at cheerleading
and sticking up for myself.

1:00:46.171 --> 1:00:47.840
- Big deal.
- It is a big deal.

1:00:47.873 --> 1:00:50.075
Seriously. You've got a lot
going for you.

1:00:50.109 --> 1:00:51.877
Thanks, Roland.

1:00:53.479 --> 1:00:56.148
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

1:00:56.181 --> 1:00:58.117
- What?
- Remember the night

1:00:58.150 --> 1:01:00.552
you came over to my house?

1:01:00.586 --> 1:01:02.087
No, of course not,
why would you?

1:01:02.121 --> 1:01:04.089
My friend, Xander, and I,
we, um,

1:01:04.123 --> 1:01:06.358
we kind of cast a spell on you.

1:01:06.392 --> 1:01:07.326
You're losing me here, Roland.

1:01:07.359 --> 1:01:09.928
- Xander and I, we're witches.
- Witches?

1:01:09.962 --> 1:01:12.331
Look, I know that's gonna sound
really out there,

1:01:12.364 --> 1:01:14.500
but the point is,
we cast a spell on you

1:01:14.533 --> 1:01:16.468
to make you like me,
and you and I almost had sex.

1:01:16.502 --> 1:01:17.936
We didn't.

1:01:17.970 --> 1:01:19.104
- I swear.
- What?

1:01:19.138 --> 1:01:20.906
I just wanted you to like me.

1:01:20.939 --> 1:01:22.875
So you put
a fucking rape spell on me?

1:01:22.908 --> 1:01:26.211
Look, I swear, nothing happened
between us, okay?

1:01:26.245 --> 1:01:27.579
I just...

1:01:27.613 --> 1:01:29.882
You said some things,
and I don't know

1:01:29.915 --> 1:01:33.252
if it was the spell or what,
but it felt so real.

1:01:33.285 --> 1:01:35.421
So how am I supposed to know
that me liking you now

1:01:35.454 --> 1:01:37.556
- isn't bullshit?
- Because I canceled the spell,

1:01:37.589 --> 1:01:40.326
okay, I am done
with witchcraft.

1:01:40.359 --> 1:01:43.228
You know, I knew
you were weird, but wow.

1:01:43.262 --> 1:01:46.131
No, Veronica, please,
I'm sorry!

1:01:46.165 --> 1:01:48.467
I'm sorry.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:50.903
Fuck!

1:02:11.090 --> 1:02:14.326
- Can I help you?
- Are you Roland Grimm?

1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:16.128
I'm Detective Proctor,
I'd like to speak with you.

1:02:19.198 --> 1:02:20.265
Do you know this kid?

1:02:22.134 --> 1:02:25.237
Uh, he goes to my high school.

1:02:25.270 --> 1:02:28.006
His parents reported him
missing two days ago.

1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:30.142
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:02:30.175 --> 1:02:32.378
You mean you knew that already?

1:02:32.411 --> 1:02:34.279
No, I meant nothing.

1:02:34.313 --> 1:02:37.049
I'm sorry,
it's been a long week.

1:02:37.082 --> 1:02:38.917
Are you friends with Hans?

1:02:38.951 --> 1:02:41.153
- Yes.
- Really?

1:02:42.221 --> 1:02:43.690
- Kind of.
- Well, not according

1:02:43.723 --> 1:02:45.524
to Conrad Miller.

1:02:45.557 --> 1:02:48.160
I just got done
talking to him.

1:02:48.193 --> 1:02:51.196
He said that Hans left him
a voicemail about you,

1:02:51.230 --> 1:02:53.232
a very strange voicemail.

1:02:53.265 --> 1:02:54.967
- He did?
- Yeah, he said

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.335
you're into voodoo.

1:02:56.368 --> 1:02:59.538
You do voodoo, Roland?

1:02:59.571 --> 1:03:02.574
Witchcraft? Black magic?

1:03:02.608 --> 1:03:04.209
It's not that taboo these days.

1:03:04.243 --> 1:03:06.044
My niece is a Wiccan.

1:03:06.078 --> 1:03:08.447
He's probably just confused.

1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:10.282
I'm currently working
on a project

1:03:10.315 --> 1:03:13.185
on the Salem witch trials,
so...

1:03:13.218 --> 1:03:14.654
Really?

1:03:16.255 --> 1:03:18.190
I promise, sir,

1:03:18.223 --> 1:03:20.459
I am no witch.

1:03:29.368 --> 1:03:32.171
- Hey, stranger.
- We're fucked.

1:03:39.311 --> 1:03:40.446
I knew we wouldn't
get away with this.

1:03:40.479 --> 1:03:41.613
We're fucking murderers.

1:03:41.648 --> 1:03:43.248
Hey.

1:03:43.282 --> 1:03:46.618
First of all, it was
a complete accident.

1:03:46.653 --> 1:03:50.189
And second of all, how's
anybody gonna find out now?

1:03:50.222 --> 1:03:52.291
It still doesn't feel right.

1:03:52.324 --> 1:03:54.526
No, I know,
but this isn't Salem.

1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:58.363
Nobody is gonna put us on trial
for witchcraft.

1:03:58.397 --> 1:04:01.033
Can you please sit down
and have a drink?

1:04:02.234 --> 1:04:04.036
No. We're done.

1:04:05.504 --> 1:04:07.339
I don't want to be
your friend anymore.

1:04:07.372 --> 1:04:09.007
What?

1:04:09.041 --> 1:04:12.377
Hey, Hans is dead,
Veronica hates me now,

1:04:12.411 --> 1:04:15.280
and everything is going to shit
because of you.

1:04:16.315 --> 1:04:17.717
Roland...

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:20.219
Come on.

1:04:20.252 --> 1:04:23.155
Come on, Roland, I said
I wouldn't use witchcraft

1:04:23.188 --> 1:04:25.023
and I haven't.

1:04:25.057 --> 1:04:27.192
I kept my word.

1:04:27.226 --> 1:04:29.428
It has nothing to do
with black magic or witchcraft

1:04:29.461 --> 1:04:30.429
or whatever
you want to call it.

1:04:30.462 --> 1:04:33.098
It's you.

1:04:33.131 --> 1:04:35.133
- What do you mean?
- I mean you don't fucking care

1:04:35.167 --> 1:04:38.170
about anybody besides yourself.

1:04:52.284 --> 1:04:54.319
Mr. Hunter, what's going on?

1:04:54.353 --> 1:04:58.156
I know I sound delusional,
but it's true.

1:04:58.190 --> 1:05:00.693
There's no such thing
as witchcraft.

1:05:06.298 --> 1:05:07.667
Why do you think Conrad here

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:10.102
is turning into
the fucking Elephant Man, huh?

1:05:10.135 --> 1:05:13.105
- They put a spell on him.
- That's impossible.

1:05:13.138 --> 1:05:16.475
Uncle Fred, remember
the voicemail from Hans?

1:05:16.508 --> 1:05:19.444
Mm, you're not gonna hear
from Hans ever again.

1:05:19.478 --> 1:05:21.446
They did something to him too.

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:22.682
Not that I really care.

1:05:22.715 --> 1:05:24.149
The kid was a pain in the ass.

1:05:24.182 --> 1:05:25.617
- What?
- Mm.

1:05:25.652 --> 1:05:28.186
Let's say this is all true,

1:05:28.220 --> 1:05:29.588
why are you the whistleblower?

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:30.757
Well, it's simple.

1:05:30.790 --> 1:05:33.458
I need $10,000.

1:05:33.492 --> 1:05:35.627
- You're crazy.
- Okay.

1:05:35.662 --> 1:05:37.429
Have fun looking like Shrek
at prom, kid.

1:05:37.462 --> 1:05:38.731
Okay, wait, wait a minute.

1:05:40.733 --> 1:05:43.535
Uncle Fred...

1:05:43.569 --> 1:05:45.137
...you have the money.

1:05:45.170 --> 1:05:46.505
Shut up.

1:05:50.442 --> 1:05:53.178
So, how do we get rid
of this hex?

1:05:53.211 --> 1:05:54.714
You could just kill Xander
with a gun,

1:05:54.747 --> 1:05:57.516
but that won't take off
any of the spells he's cast.

1:05:57.549 --> 1:05:58.517
Damn, Mr. Hunter,

1:05:58.550 --> 1:06:00.385
you really went all out on this.

1:06:01.821 --> 1:06:03.690
Crushing. Pretty simple.

1:06:03.723 --> 1:06:04.623
Tie him to a board,

1:06:04.657 --> 1:06:06.525
put a bunch of stones
and rocks on top.

1:06:06.558 --> 1:06:07.593
He stops breathing.

1:06:07.626 --> 1:06:09.394
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I like that one.

1:06:09.428 --> 1:06:11.731
Mm.

1:06:11.764 --> 1:06:14.399
Hanging. Find a noose,
put it around his neck,

1:06:14.433 --> 1:06:15.635
tie it to a tree.

1:06:15.668 --> 1:06:17.804
Dead.

1:06:17.837 --> 1:06:19.271
Burning at the stake,

1:06:19.304 --> 1:06:20.873
the most popular way
to kill a witch.

1:06:20.907 --> 1:06:23.676
Tie him to a piece of wood,
pour gasoline all over him,

1:06:23.710 --> 1:06:25.678
and light that motherfucker.

1:06:25.712 --> 1:06:28.681
- What about drowning?
- Mm, not gonna work.

1:06:28.715 --> 1:06:32.451
If Xander really is a witch,
which he is, he'll float.

1:06:33.886 --> 1:06:37.556
Uncle Fred, what do you think?

1:06:41.593 --> 1:06:43.830
Burn, witch, burn.

1:06:48.968 --> 1:06:51.436
Where's Roland been?

1:06:51.470 --> 1:06:53.773
I don't think
I'm gonna see him anymore.

1:06:53.806 --> 1:06:56.709
But I thought you liked him?

1:06:56.743 --> 1:06:59.144
It's complicated.

1:07:00.445 --> 1:07:01.446
I thought he was a lot better

1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:02.715
than the other boys at school.

1:07:05.384 --> 1:07:07.519
You're right, he was.

1:07:14.326 --> 1:07:16.763
Hey.

1:07:16.796 --> 1:07:17.864
Ow.

1:07:17.897 --> 1:07:20.365
Now we're even.

1:07:20.399 --> 1:07:24.302
So, you promise
you reversed the spell?

1:07:24.336 --> 1:07:27.472
I promise, I would never
do that to you.

1:07:34.681 --> 1:07:37.349
You really want to go,
don't you?

1:07:37.382 --> 1:07:38.283
I don't want
to be here anymore.

1:07:38.316 --> 1:07:41.620
So, I'm guessing
you heard about Hans.

1:07:41.654 --> 1:07:44.991
- Hans?
- Yeah, he went missing.

1:07:45.024 --> 1:07:47.860
Oh, wow.

1:07:47.894 --> 1:07:49.896
Maybe he ran away.

1:07:49.929 --> 1:07:52.431
Yeah, maybe.

1:07:52.464 --> 1:07:54.232
I don't know, his parents
must be worried sick.

1:07:54.266 --> 1:07:56.401
- ...ever since your father.
- Yeah, but neither have you.

1:07:56.435 --> 1:07:57.870
Yeah, I can't imagine.

1:07:57.904 --> 1:08:00.338
You're right. Simon, I can't...

1:08:28.433 --> 1:08:30.937
Hey, man, what's going on?

1:08:30.970 --> 1:08:33.973
I totally overreacted
the other day.

1:08:35.007 --> 1:08:36.676
That's all right.

1:08:36.709 --> 1:08:37.609
You know,
I'm probably gonna give

1:08:37.643 --> 1:08:39.746
this witchcraft thing up
for good this time.

1:08:39.779 --> 1:08:41.714
Really? Well, that's great.

1:08:41.748 --> 1:08:43.482
Yeah, I mean,
I think the side effects

1:08:43.515 --> 1:08:44.684
are gonna wear off eventually.

1:09:15.614 --> 1:09:16.716
Do you guys mind?

1:09:16.749 --> 1:09:19.417
This is gonna be
kind of awkward.

1:09:28.094 --> 1:09:29.796
Henry?

1:09:29.829 --> 1:09:31.596
Dammit, how do I do this?

1:09:33.398 --> 1:09:35.868
The point is, I love you man.

1:09:35.902 --> 1:09:36.903
I do.

1:09:36.936 --> 1:09:38.570
You're my buddy.

1:09:38.603 --> 1:09:41.774
But I really,
really love my house.

1:09:41.808 --> 1:09:43.408
Plus, I can't
even begin to imagine

1:09:43.441 --> 1:09:45.878
what a foreclosure would do
to my credit.

1:09:47.379 --> 1:09:50.348
But more importantly,

1:09:50.382 --> 1:09:54.086
did you really think
that I would not care, hm?

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.588
After all I've done for you.

1:09:56.621 --> 1:09:58.858
But some pathetic,
nerdy teenager comes along

1:09:58.891 --> 1:10:02.094
and, suddenly,
witchcraft can be taught.

1:10:02.128 --> 1:10:03.628
What about me, hm?

1:10:03.663 --> 1:10:05.597
Your best fucking friend.

1:10:05.631 --> 1:10:09.802
Henry, you don't understand,
it's not that simple.

1:10:09.836 --> 1:10:13.438
I don't care anymore, Xander,
I really don't.

1:10:18.878 --> 1:10:21.848
I hope you burn nice and slow.

1:10:26.819 --> 1:10:28.453
Henry?

1:10:28.486 --> 1:10:29.856
Henry.

1:10:29.889 --> 1:10:31.523
Henry, please come back.

1:10:31.556 --> 1:10:34.093
Oh, shit.

1:11:18.137 --> 1:11:19.105
Roland.

1:11:19.138 --> 1:11:21.173
Roland.

1:11:22.942 --> 1:11:24.442
Roland, where are you?

1:11:24.476 --> 1:11:26.544
Roland, it's Xander.

1:11:26.578 --> 1:11:29.081
Roland, please,
they're gonna kill me.

1:11:29.115 --> 1:11:30.448
They're gonna kill me.

1:11:30.482 --> 1:11:31.717
They're gonna kill me.

1:11:31.751 --> 1:11:32.985
They're gonna kill me.

1:11:33.019 --> 1:11:34.921
They're gonna kill me.

1:11:44.230 --> 1:11:45.965
Veronica, we have to go.

1:11:45.998 --> 1:11:47.667
What's wrong?

1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:48.500
It's Xander.

1:11:48.533 --> 1:11:50.903
- Conrad is gonna hurt him.
- Conrad?

1:11:50.937 --> 1:11:52.171
Do you remember when I told you
about Xander and I

1:11:52.204 --> 1:11:54.472
- being witches?
- Yeah.

1:11:55.641 --> 1:11:57.043
Well, Hans found out.

1:11:57.076 --> 1:11:58.576
Wait, you know where Hans is.

1:11:58.610 --> 1:11:59.879
Sort of, yes.

1:11:59.912 --> 1:12:02.181
Roland, what did you do?

1:12:02.214 --> 1:12:04.083
He was gonna use it against us.

1:12:04.116 --> 1:12:05.184
So, Xander tried
to cast a spell

1:12:05.217 --> 1:12:07.585
to keep him quiet, but...

1:12:08.988 --> 1:12:11.023
Hans is dead.

1:12:11.057 --> 1:12:12.992
- You killed him?
- It was an accident.

1:12:13.025 --> 1:12:14.727
Oh, yeah, like the spell
you cast on me.

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.561
Veronica, please.

1:12:16.594 --> 1:12:17.964
Okay, we have to help him.

1:12:17.997 --> 1:12:20.866
He's my only friend.

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:23.468
Please, just trust me.

1:12:35.281 --> 1:12:38.184
Again, Xander, really sorry
about all this, buddy.

1:12:38.217 --> 1:12:39.952
Do me a favor, all right?

1:12:39.986 --> 1:12:42.989
Don't curse my future family
or anything like that.

1:12:43.022 --> 1:12:45.925
You guys tend to do that a lot
in the movies.

1:13:01.173 --> 1:13:02.742
All right, Frederick,
I'm heading out.

1:13:02.775 --> 1:13:04.910
I prefer cash
if you don't mind.

1:13:04.944 --> 1:13:06.245
- Cash?
- Yeah.

1:13:06.278 --> 1:13:09.015
Of course.

1:13:18.124 --> 1:13:19.792
Ten grand?

1:13:19.825 --> 1:13:21.894
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:30.803
Okay, good.

1:13:30.836 --> 1:13:33.072
Well, now my college fund
is safe.

1:13:33.105 --> 1:13:35.708
Come on, Con,
let's get this shit over with.

1:14:05.771 --> 1:14:08.874
Please, Conrad, don't.

1:14:12.011 --> 1:14:13.145
Conrad!

1:14:15.781 --> 1:14:17.650
Ha!

1:15:03.462 --> 1:15:04.697
Xander.

1:16:08.761 --> 1:16:10.763
Abracadabra, motherfucker.

1:16:42.194 --> 1:16:44.763
Wh... what are we supposed
to tell the cops?

1:16:49.068 --> 1:16:52.037
We're not telling them
anything.

1:16:52.071 --> 1:16:55.341
As far as I'm concerned,
I've never lived in this town.

1:16:57.076 --> 1:16:59.445
But... but you're a witch.

1:16:59.478 --> 1:17:03.215
Can't you... can't you
bring him back?

1:17:03.249 --> 1:17:07.119
Can't you reverse
all this shit?

1:17:11.423 --> 1:17:13.225
It would be a big mistake.

1:17:18.597 --> 1:17:21.200
I'm sorry.

1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:44.550
Rasta conspira, life conjura.

1:18:44.583 --> 1:18:47.886
Rasta conspira, life conjura.

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.123
Rasta conspira, life conjura.

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:15.514
Roland?

1:19:15.547 --> 1:19:16.548
Roland?

1:19:16.582 --> 1:19:19.418
Hey, hey, it's... it's me.

1:19:22.655 --> 1:19:24.123
Roland?
