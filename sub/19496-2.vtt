01:11.830 --> 01:12.879
<i>Bitch.</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:14.539
<i>Fucking bitch.</i>

01:14.540 --> 01:15.879
<i>I know where you live.</i>

01:15.880 --> 01:17.879
<i>I know where your family...</i>

01:17.880 --> 01:19.879
This is for Maia Rindell.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.459
I'm gonna rape you
and your dyke girl...

01:23.540 --> 01:24.999
Hi. Good morning.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.619
And fuck you.
You stole my money.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.499
I just want you
to hurt like I do.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.619
Hi, it's my first day here.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.619
And, uh, I'm not too
sure where to g...

01:57.620 --> 01:58.669
Maia Rindell?

01:58.670 --> 02:00.079
Yes!

02:00.080 --> 02:01.119
You okay?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.209
Yes!

02:02.210 --> 02:03.919
Just, um...

02:03.920 --> 02:05.579
Hi.

02:05.580 --> 02:06.879
Julius Cain.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.749
I'm the managing partner here.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.538
Let me show you to your desk.

02:10.539 --> 02:13.459
We have 55 associates
and 40 work stations,

02:13.460 --> 02:16.289
so we employ a hot desk system.

02:16.290 --> 02:19.289
Occupy any empty chair
in the communal area,

02:19.290 --> 02:21.539
but keep your laptop with you
because you might be returning

02:21.540 --> 02:23.209
to a different space
when you come back.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.379
Go ahead.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.579
Good.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.539
At 10:00, I'm gonna need you
at the SWSMU offices,

02:29.540 --> 02:31.459
so meet me at reception
in 20 minutes.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.669
The what?

02:32.670 --> 02:34.419
SWSMU.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.169
One of our union contracts.

02:36.170 --> 02:38.289
Once a month, we offer
their members pro Bono service

02:38.290 --> 02:39.290
as part of our retainer.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.750
20 minutes.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.379
Did you hear that, Diane?

02:58.380 --> 03:00.709
I... yes.
I just can't believe it.

03:00.710 --> 03:03.289
They're withholding
my capital contribution?

03:03.290 --> 03:05.289
They say they have
to review your tenure.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.459
What tenure?!
I was a name partner.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.829
I created that firm.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.079
It's my money.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.169
I'm sorry, Diane.

03:13.170 --> 03:15.419
Do I have any reserves?

03:15.420 --> 03:17.790
If you sell your apartment.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.459
I can't do that.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.749
Well, you can always
talk to your new partners,

03:23.750 --> 03:26.209
and see if they'll
offer you a loan.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.379
Ah, we tried to call you
at home.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.959
Because?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.959
We're moving you down the hall.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.579
There's a new partner.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.419
We have to make room.

03:54.420 --> 03:55.879
Diane?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.619
Yep.

03:58.620 --> 04:02.419
See, it's not so bad.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.459
Home sweet home.

04:06.290 --> 04:09.169
Oh, and I'm gonna need you
at the SWSMU this morning.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.079
Why?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.619
I did it last month.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.580
Yes, and you were
so good at it, too.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.419
Good morning.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.750
Sharise.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.579
Come on, come get this.
Come get this.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.669
Come get this!

04:30.750 --> 04:32.669
How that college search coming?

04:32.670 --> 04:34.499
Ah, all-consuming.
Twins, you know.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.539
Yeah, I hear you.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.919
Any word on the Kendall offer?

04:37.920 --> 04:39.329
They called this morning.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.459
Who? David Lee?

04:41.460 --> 04:43.749
Yes, sir.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.669
We're getting our six mill.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.329
Diane here yet?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.039
Yeah, she's in with Barbara.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.500
She is, huh?

04:54.500 --> 04:57.879
I heard you speak at an ABA
conference a few years ago.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.579
Oh, yes. On racial hiring?

04:59.580 --> 05:00.880
That's right.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.249
Oh, well, I hope I didn't
embarrass myself too much.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.999
Hmm, not too much.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.379
Diane Lockhart.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.579
I feel like we acquired

05:14.580 --> 05:16.119
our very own Jimmy Butler
right here.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.709
Adrian, how are you?

05:17.710 --> 05:18.749
Good, good.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.209
A little gift for you.

05:21.210 --> 05:22.499
Spring Arbor Lake Wine,

05:22.500 --> 05:24.959
my very own label, 2006. Mwah.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.119
You have a winery?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.579
Ah, just a row of vines,
that's all. Sit, sit.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.619
So how's everything going
with you two?

05:31.620 --> 05:32.500
Barbara give you the rundown?

05:32.501 --> 05:33.749
She did.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.750
Are you two playing nice?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.749
We are, Adrian.
Good.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.209
Oh, by the way,
just a housekeeping matter,

05:39.210 --> 05:41.419
but we'll need
your capital contribution

05:41.420 --> 05:43.459
by next week.

05:43.460 --> 05:46.329
Oh, yes, of course. Um,

05:46.330 --> 05:47.579
just so you know, my old firm

05:47.580 --> 05:49.999
is being a bit intransigent.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.829
Yeah, David Lee.
Wonderful guy.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.249
So, um, if you don't mind being

05:55.250 --> 05:56.459
a bit patient.

05:56.460 --> 05:57.460
Of course.

05:57.460 --> 05:58.420
But listen, I'll need you

05:58.421 --> 05:59.999
in the 11:00 a.m. meeting
to pitch cases

06:00.000 --> 06:01.669
to our litigation financiers.

06:01.670 --> 06:04.419
Right. Well, good.
I'll see you there.

06:04.420 --> 06:05.420
You will.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.000
Diane.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.999
Welcome.
Thank you.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Hmm.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.879
And how patient

06:18.880 --> 06:19.919
are we to be?

06:19.920 --> 06:21.420
Let's give her two weeks.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.039
Hello?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.329
Just plugging in your computer.

06:27.330 --> 06:31.289
Are you from Lockhart, Deckler?

06:31.290 --> 06:32.499
Lee, Lyman, Deckler, Gussman...

06:32.500 --> 06:34.039
Well, that didn't
take them very long.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.789
I know.
Bunch of assholes.

06:35.790 --> 06:36.829
Marissa?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.249
Yeah, hey.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.709
Want me to set up anything else?

06:39.710 --> 06:41.119
No, I can do it.
No, let me.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.619
If I get back too quick,

06:42.620 --> 06:44.119
they'll just send me out
on another errand.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.619
Here, I'll hang these.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.499
When Alicia hired me,
I was supposed to be involved

06:49.500 --> 06:50.829
in cases and everything,

06:50.830 --> 06:53.419
but it's been all moving
boxes since she left.

06:53.420 --> 06:54.459
Still want this?

06:54.460 --> 06:57.289
Definitely.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.459
And, uh,
where do you want these?

06:59.460 --> 07:02.419
What are those?
African masks.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.539
Well, I can see that.
Where are they from?

07:05.540 --> 07:06.619
Your office.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.580
No.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.619
David Lee. Very funny.

07:11.620 --> 07:12.749
By the way,

07:12.750 --> 07:14.790
I know you still need
an assistant, Diane.

07:15.790 --> 07:16.879
Hello.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.419
Uh, this is Marissa,

07:18.420 --> 07:19.619
from my old firm.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.740
Hi. Just dropping stuff off.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.119
Well, I have a few people
coming in today

07:26.120 --> 07:27.329
for possible assistants.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.119
I'll send them by.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.210
Thank you.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.119
Okay, I don't want
to sound self-serving here,

07:36.120 --> 07:37.999
but I think it's a smart move
for you to hire me.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.119
Oh, good to know.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.119
Thank you.
No, seriously.
You need an assistant.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.579
I can do whatever
you want around here,

07:43.580 --> 07:45.169
and I'm not that expensive.
What are you paying?

07:45.170 --> 07:47.749
Why don't you just leave
your résumé, Marissa?

07:47.750 --> 07:48.959
I don't have one.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.209
I'm much better
in person, anyway.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.999
Look, just hire me for one day,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.539
just until you get
someone better.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.620
And I promise you won't
get someone better.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.579
<i>You limit your
pro Bono consultations</i>

07:59.580 --> 08:00.540
to 20 minutes each.

08:00.541 --> 08:02.919
If their legal issues require
more time, go to Lucca.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.329
She will sign off on more time.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.709
Remember, you're only here

08:06.710 --> 08:09.419
to offer legal advice,
not legal work.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.539
Don't get tied down.
Move people on into other

08:12.540 --> 08:14.539
legal resources when you can:

08:14.540 --> 08:16.039
Prairie State
or Legal Assistance.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.829
You're the "door close"
button in the elevator.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.749
Comforting, but not
necessarily effective.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.539
Here we go.

08:25.540 --> 08:28.169
Okay, members,
listen up, listen up.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.959
Remember these lawyers are here

08:29.960 --> 08:32.539
as union advocates,
so please limit your questions

08:32.539 --> 08:33.708
to workplace matters.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.208
Only workplace matters.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.789
Okay, who is here on their work
break, please raise your hand.

08:39.789 --> 08:40.789
Oh, come on.

08:40.789 --> 08:41.789
Donny, I know it's your day off.

08:41.791 --> 08:43.119
Get your hand down.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.619
Only people on
their lunch break.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.119
Come on,
you're only screwing over

08:47.120 --> 08:48.959
your union brother and sister.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.209
Good. Those on lunch break,
come on up to the stage.

08:52.210 --> 08:55.169
Line up for each desk.
Let's go.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.169
You're seriously telling me
I have to go to someone else

09:00.170 --> 09:01.919
on my lunch break?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.669
The thing is, ma'am,
we're not really here

09:03.670 --> 09:07.119
to help with family law issues,
but, uh, I can refer you to...

09:07.120 --> 09:09.039
He's not paying child support!

09:09.040 --> 09:10.289
How am I supposed
to make ends meet

09:10.290 --> 09:11.290
if he won't pay child support?

09:11.291 --> 09:12.999
I know, I'm sorry.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.669
It's just...

09:14.670 --> 09:16.209
Well, I'm not really
supposed to help with...

09:16.210 --> 09:18.079
Then why are you here?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.210
If you can't help,
why are you here?

09:24.460 --> 09:26.039
I need help.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.380
Hello.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.040
Oh, come on.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.249
I'm gonna help you out here.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.789
Thank you.

09:52.790 --> 09:56.079
Sir, would you like
to come to my desk?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.999
No, I'm good here.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.169
I'm a third-year associate.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.459
She just passed the bar.

10:01.460 --> 10:02.999
That's okay.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.040
I'm sticking.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.830
Next?

10:12.040 --> 10:15.169
I, I just can't survive
on $400 a week.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.459
I can't pay for my rent.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.579
I can't pay for my ex-wife.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.289
And they're not adjusting
it for after taxes.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.209
They're just taking it
right off the top.

10:22.210 --> 10:24.039
I-I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.169
You're... you're being paid
$400 a week?

10:26.170 --> 10:29.209
Yeah. Wait, no.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.579
And my rent is twice that.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.289
Okay? Do you need to get that?

10:32.290 --> 10:33.419
No.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.379
Uh, no.
It does that.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.999
Yeah, mine, too.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.289
You know, I used to
get some good news,

10:38.290 --> 10:40.619
but now I feel like
it's all bad.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.789
I don't even like
answering it nowadays.

10:43.790 --> 10:47.789
So, um, I'm sorry,
I'm, I'm not too sure

10:47.790 --> 10:50.039
how they were able
to lower your salary.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.040
Not lower.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.459
Garnish.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.669
They're saying that I stole
400 running shoes.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.619
What? 400 running shoes?
Yeah.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.999
And they say that's $70,000,
but that's retail,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.419
and they don't pay retail.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.379
They just pay wholesale,
so it should be half that.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.379
Wait, I'm sorry.
Could-could you start again?

11:04.380 --> 11:07.879
Okay, BMI...

11:07.880 --> 11:08.959
Mm-hmm.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.249
...my store says that I stole

11:11.250 --> 11:13.169
400 running shoes.
And did you?

11:13.170 --> 11:16.919
No, I've never stolen
anything in my entire life.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.709
But they're garnishing my wages
for the retail amount,

11:19.710 --> 11:21.579
and it should be the
wholesale amount.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.249
That's double what I should pay!

11:23.250 --> 11:24.919
But if you didn't
steal anything,

11:24.920 --> 11:26.919
why are you letting them
garnish your wages at all?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.170
Because I signed a confession.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.329
I don't understand.
Why did he confess?

11:32.330 --> 11:33.330
They pressured him to.

11:33.331 --> 11:35.669
They threatened to fire him
if he didn't.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.249
He just wants them to charge him

11:37.250 --> 11:39.749
the wholesale amount
and not the retail amount.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.579
And he wants to go
to arbitration for that?

11:41.580 --> 11:44.919
Well, his contract requires
that he go to arbitration.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.329
But he wants me
to represent him.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.789
I just need you to sign me off

11:48.790 --> 11:51.379
on two more hours work.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.329
You know this is just pro Bono?

11:53.330 --> 11:54.879
Right? It's a
goodwill gesture.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.999
We're not here to right a wrong.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.169
No, I know,

11:57.170 --> 11:59.249
but it's only two hours work.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.919
I want to do it.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.579
When's the arbitration?

12:02.580 --> 12:03.749
This afternoon.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.619
Okay.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.170
Good luck.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.420
Everything good with you?

12:12.380 --> 12:13.380
Yeah.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.669
Yeah, for the first time
in a while... yes.

12:18.670 --> 12:22.170
It's good when you can focus
on someone else's problem.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.250
First place I've been
I wasn't recognized.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.209
This is
our highest priority case.

12:39.210 --> 12:42.379
It's a hanging
in a jail cell... Holly Orlin.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.959
You'll find a <i>Chicago Tribune
</i> article on top there.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.079
This is the worst
Cook County jail abuse

12:47.080 --> 12:49.249
I have seen in years.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.669
So, we're suing for $12 million,

12:50.670 --> 12:52.289
but we do expect settlement
before trial.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.539
Any videotape?
No.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.619
But we have
a very sympathetic family

12:56.620 --> 12:58.249
and a grieving widower.

12:58.250 --> 13:02.039
So, all we need of your
financing is $300 thousand.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.039
Mm-mm.
No. Thanks, though.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.169
Our algorithm is going
cool on police suits.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.289
You sure about that?

13:09.290 --> 13:11.709
Mm-hmm.
What else?

13:11.710 --> 13:13.329
Well, I think that, uh, Diane,

13:13.330 --> 13:15.169
our newest partner...
she just joined us

13:15.170 --> 13:16.209
from Lockhart,
Deckler & Gussman...

13:16.210 --> 13:17.749
can speak to a new case.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.459
Uh, we've been looking
into parole abuses.

13:20.460 --> 13:24.539
Some parolees have been rejected
for, uh, punitive reasons.

13:24.540 --> 13:28.329
Hmm. I think my partner worries
there's no money there.

13:28.330 --> 13:31.209
That depends on how
vulnerable the State feels.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.539
No. It depends
on the trend.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.619
The trend is against you.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.959
Look, now we understand you have
your little algebraic spells,

13:38.960 --> 13:40.289
but we understand the system.

13:40.290 --> 13:41.290
And you'll get ten percent

13:41.291 --> 13:43.249
of our earnings.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.289
Why don't you let us help you
make some money?

13:45.290 --> 13:47.670
What else have you got?

13:49.250 --> 13:50.419
Malpractice?
Mm-hmm.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.420
It's a malpractice suit.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.669
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.249
Second page.
What's wrong?

13:59.250 --> 14:00.250
Someone here to see you.

14:00.251 --> 14:01.579
Lenore Rindell.

14:01.580 --> 14:03.249
Where?

14:03.250 --> 14:04.379
In your office.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.960
You want me to get rid of her?

14:10.960 --> 14:13.419
What do you need, Lenore?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.539
I-I came to see Maia.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.209
She's out.

14:16.210 --> 14:18.249
She's not talking to me,
she's not answering my calls.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.169
My guess is her lawyer
told her not to.

14:20.170 --> 14:23.209
Can you talk to her, Diane?
Please.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.119
No.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.959
Why?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.749
I don't know what bubble
you're living in, Lenore,

14:29.750 --> 14:31.119
but you do see my office here?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.329
You do see
that I am not retired,

14:32.330 --> 14:33.330
that I am still working.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.959
This wasn't us.
This was Jax.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.329
This is his Ponzi scheme,
not ours...

14:36.330 --> 14:38.289
You want to have an honest
conversation here,

14:38.290 --> 14:40.169
then let's have it.
I came to you last week

14:40.170 --> 14:42.209
for my money back so that
I could buy my dream house,

14:42.210 --> 14:43.709
and what did you say?
We didn't...

14:43.710 --> 14:45.169
No, I want to hear you say it.
What did you say?

14:45.170 --> 14:46.379
This wasn't us.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.380
You said keep it
in your account,

14:47.381 --> 14:48.619
and borrow on it.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.249
I could've had my money back.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.209
I...

14:53.210 --> 14:55.380
I think it's a good
idea that you go.

14:57.420 --> 14:59.119
Diane,

14:59.120 --> 15:01.669
look at me.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.669
I'm innocent.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.709
Henry's innocent.

15:05.710 --> 15:07.419
You are a defense lawyer.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.209
Why can't you extend us
the same courtesy

15:09.210 --> 15:11.210
you do your other clients?

15:12.920 --> 15:15.169
We are wrongly accused.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.209
Just because the Feds say it

15:17.210 --> 15:19.210
doesn't make it true.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.250
I'll tell Maia
that you dropped by.

15:35.290 --> 15:40.459
I know I shouldn't ask this,
but Henry needs your help.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.790
He's in jail
and no one will visit him.

15:44.830 --> 15:47.169
His lawyer's advising him
to plead guilty,

15:47.170 --> 15:49.210
but I don't think he should.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.209
He's your oldest friend, Diane.

15:53.210 --> 15:56.290
Will you talk to him?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.999
So it's like a trial?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.249
Yes, just answer honestly.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.959
That's all you have to do.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.499
And if I lose?

16:13.500 --> 16:18.119
Well, there's no appeal,
so if you lose, you lose.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.329
Frank Gwinn.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.329
Here.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.209
Go ahead.
You're the lawyer?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.289
Uh, yes, from Reddick,
Boseman & Kolstad...

16:27.290 --> 16:28.329
Good, I'm the arbiter.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.789
Let's hear it.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.289
And this is Benji Diyardian

16:32.290 --> 16:33.290
from BMI's
loss-prevention department.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.119
He questioned me.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.329
Let's hear it.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.210
I...

16:41.210 --> 16:43.079
Good afternoon.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.539
Frank's employer, BMI,

16:45.540 --> 16:48.669
a sporting good store
with $12 billion in assets

16:48.670 --> 16:50.789
and franchises
throughout the country...

16:50.790 --> 16:52.459
Yeah, I-I don't need that.

16:52.460 --> 16:55.749
Right. Um...

16:55.750 --> 16:57.879
They have accused my client
of stealing

16:57.880 --> 17:00.379
400 running shoes
from their back-stock.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.170
417.
Objection.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.289
Okay, um,

17:06.290 --> 17:07.459
and he didn't do it, right?

17:07.460 --> 17:08.749
Uh, that is correct, sir.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.579
He did not do it.

17:10.579 --> 17:11.959
What do you need, ma'am?

17:11.960 --> 17:13.440
I'm here as an observer
for the union.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.169
Why?

17:16.170 --> 17:18.079
We just want to make sure
everything's fair.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.378
Okay, keep going, miss.

17:25.380 --> 17:28.539
My client
did not steal any shoes.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.209
He has no record
and yet the company, BMI,

17:31.210 --> 17:33.379
have chosen to garnish
his salary by almost 40%.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.329
We didn't garnish
anything, he confessed.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.829
No, excuse me, sir,
you'll have your chance.

17:37.830 --> 17:41.539
Um, this is a massive,

17:41.540 --> 17:43.169
$12 billion company

17:43.170 --> 17:45.079
stealing half my client's pay.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.379
Stealing, really? We have
his confession on the record.

17:46.380 --> 17:47.749
No, he was forced to confess.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.079
He was told
if he did not confess...

17:49.080 --> 17:50.249
He was not told anything.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.829
If he did not confess,
then he would be fired.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.209
Frank, how long

17:54.210 --> 17:55.879
did this man
question you?
Seven hours.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.999
Without break. He was told
he could not leave the room.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.169
Only because he's an employee
and he was on the clock.

18:00.170 --> 18:01.540
Let me see the confession.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.209
Would the union rep
like to see it, too?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.120
Uh, I would, thank you.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.169
Mr. Arbiter, as you read that,
please remember

18:11.170 --> 18:13.079
that he was forced
to sign that confession.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.249
I never forced anyone.
This is the Friedman method.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.499
I never diverged once
from it at all.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.290
The what?

18:18.291 --> 18:19.329
The Friedman method,

18:19.330 --> 18:20.749
it's a process of questioning

18:20.750 --> 18:22.420
I was trained and certified in.

18:24.290 --> 18:28.829
Sir, is this your signature?

18:28.830 --> 18:30.669
Yes.

18:30.670 --> 18:34.079
Then in exercise of powers
conferred under Clause 25

18:34.080 --> 18:35.499
of the agreement entered
into between the parties,

18:35.500 --> 18:37.620
judgment is made in favor
of the respondent.

18:38.670 --> 18:41.459
Wait, w-what?
What, that's it?

18:41.460 --> 18:42.749
Thank you, I'll see
the next arbitration.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.079
But he didn't do it!

18:44.080 --> 18:45.380
I'll see the next arbitration.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.459
False imprisonment.

18:51.460 --> 18:57.709
Mr. Arbiter, we ask that
the arbitration be reopened

18:57.710 --> 19:00.879
based on the matter
of false imprisonment.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.209
Oh, come on...

19:02.210 --> 19:03.170
My client was held

19:03.171 --> 19:05.209
against his will
for seven hours,

19:05.210 --> 19:08.419
in direct contravention of...
everything.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.749
The issue of false
imprisonment is irrelevant.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.619
Judgment is again made
in favor of the respondent.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.329
That's not your decision
to make, sir.

19:16.330 --> 19:17.919
Excuse me?

19:17.920 --> 19:19.539
The arbitration agreement

19:19.540 --> 19:22.209
with Ms. Rindell's client
does not cover tort claims.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.750
And false imprisonment
is a tort claim.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.419
Then we are stalemated.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.169
No, we're not.

19:29.170 --> 19:30.209
And why is that?

19:30.210 --> 19:33.620
Because we'll see you in court.

20:02.540 --> 20:04.210
Henry.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.789
How are you?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.919
Rupert tells me I should
accept a guilty plea.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.749
20 years.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.289
What do you think?

20:21.290 --> 20:24.040
I think this is bad, Hank.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.169
Yeah, you and I, Diane,

20:29.170 --> 20:31.539
we always told each
other the truth.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.209
No matter where...
in college, after,

20:34.210 --> 20:35.999
before Lenore.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.579
And I'm telling
you the truth now.

20:37.580 --> 20:40.000
I did not do this.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.919
Hank, what am I supposed
to do with that?

20:44.920 --> 20:47.380
I am bankrupted, completely.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.169
Two months ago, I hired
a forensics accountant

20:52.170 --> 20:54.379
to look into Jax's trades.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.209
There was $83 million missing.

20:56.210 --> 20:58.379
The accountant found Jax
had moved the money

20:58.380 --> 21:00.379
into his private account.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.289
I tried to confront him,
but before I could,

21:02.290 --> 21:05.580
Jax went to the Feds
to turn me in.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.829
You should be telling this
to your lawyer, not to me.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.289
I did, but Rupert said
it doesn't matter.

21:12.290 --> 21:14.170
There are too many bad facts.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.290
Okay.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.579
Let me look into another lawyer.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.289
Why not you?
No.

21:25.290 --> 21:27.580
You need someone objective.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.169
How's Maia?

21:33.170 --> 21:35.249
She's doing well.
Good.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.790
She's on a case.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.580
She's gonna blow us all away.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.579
Did she see her mom?

21:47.580 --> 21:50.209
No.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.619
I think it's best
that she stay away

21:52.620 --> 21:55.209
until all this
gets straightened out.

21:55.210 --> 21:58.249
But that could be years.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.500
I know.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.999
Lenore didn't tell you?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.379
Tell me what?

22:08.380 --> 22:09.879
She doesn't have years.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.119
Her breast cancer, it's back.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.290
Spread to her lymph nodes.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.289
Maybe I should go see her.

22:23.290 --> 22:26.959
I'd talk to your lawyer first.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.170
You don't think
I should go see her?

22:31.670 --> 22:34.669
No, it's just...

22:34.670 --> 22:36.540
I think you should be careful.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.459
She misunderstood my intent,

22:42.460 --> 22:44.579
or she ignored it, but we just
don't have time for this.

22:44.580 --> 22:48.289
and we raise expectations
for what our firm can do!

22:48.290 --> 22:49.749
Ah, Lucca.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.329
It seems we picked up
a new case this morning.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.709
I told you we didn't want
to get tangled up

22:53.710 --> 22:55.289
in small-ball litigation.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.499
This is not small-ball.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.289
BMI has $12 billion in assets...

22:59.290 --> 23:00.999
Yes, and there won't be
any punitive damages here.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.249
But we don't know that.
We do know that.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.249
This is one union member,

23:05.250 --> 23:07.079
and we're about to put in
40 billable hours,

23:07.080 --> 23:09.579
to get him what,
$20,000 in back pay?

23:09.580 --> 23:12.250
Is this about you losing
your office to a partner?

23:13.250 --> 23:14.959
No.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.289
This is about a good case.

23:18.750 --> 23:22.619
Hey, do you know what
the Friedman Method is?

23:22.620 --> 23:25.169
The Friedman Method?

23:25.170 --> 23:27.879
Yeah, it's a way
to interrogate a suspect... why?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.249
It's a case I'm on.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.169
How do I find out more about it?

23:31.170 --> 23:32.829
Easily, they have seminars.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.249
Just look them up online.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.789
You pay the money, and you, too,

23:35.790 --> 23:37.459
can learn how to be a cop.

23:37.460 --> 23:38.749
Good to know.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.619
Oh, okay.
I got to go, bye.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.329
We're being shut down.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.829
What?

23:44.830 --> 23:45.879
They're worried
the case is too small.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.419
You're kidding.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.379
I was just about to sign up
for a Friedman seminar

23:49.380 --> 23:50.540
to find out more.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.579
You know what, do it anyway.

23:57.580 --> 23:58.999
It's on our time.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.329
Why not?

24:01.330 --> 24:03.670
Okay.

24:05.330 --> 24:07.039
People lie.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.459
And when people lie,

24:08.460 --> 24:10.879
they want to confess...
it's human nature.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.289
Your job...
you and you and you...

24:14.290 --> 24:15.669
is to enable that process.

24:15.670 --> 24:19.039
You are a crucial step
to their cleansing.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.249
What you will learn
over the next four sessions

24:21.250 --> 24:23.169
is the Friedman method.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.920
A way to determine guilt...

24:26.250 --> 24:29.619
...and obtain a confession.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.879
One of these four people
is lying.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.709
They all deny taking money
from a cash register,

24:33.710 --> 24:35.709
but one of them did.

24:35.710 --> 24:38.039
The first step
in the Friedman Method is

24:38.040 --> 24:39.499
ascertain guilt.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.249
Find out who is lying.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.959
Look, I didn't do it.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.079
I wasn't even there.
That's the truth.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.499
Pretty convincing, huh?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.669
But ignore the words.
They're irrelevant.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.669
Everybody swears
they're innocent,

24:52.670 --> 24:55.249
but no one can hide their face.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.329
No one can hide
their expressions.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.829
The most important thing
is to get the suspect

24:59.830 --> 25:01.539
to look right at you
and repeat the statement

25:01.540 --> 25:04.209
over and over.

25:04.210 --> 25:05.749
Let's watch it again.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.119
I'm going to slow down
the image.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.789
Look, I didn't do it.

25:08.790 --> 25:11.249
I wasn't even there...
I wasn't even there.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.379
That's the truth...
There!

25:13.380 --> 25:15.419
Right there. See?
Under his lip?

25:15.420 --> 25:17.539
The risorius muscle.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.169
It's part of the expression
of fear.

25:19.170 --> 25:21.829
When we are
experiencing anxiety,

25:21.830 --> 25:24.119
the risorius muscle
will become tense.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.039
Look for it.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.379
I wasn't even there.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.119
That's the truth.
See?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.709
Clenched muscle.

25:30.710 --> 25:33.919
Good. Another telltale
sign of anxiety, the forehead.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.709
When there is a burst
of anxiety,

25:35.710 --> 25:37.379
these muscles will tighten up,

25:37.380 --> 25:40.709
the eyebrows will rise upward,
only for a second... see?

25:40.710 --> 25:44.039
The liar wants to force
his expressions to look relaxed,

25:44.040 --> 25:45.499
in control.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.919
Therefore, the expression
you're looking for

25:47.920 --> 25:50.750
is fleeting, momentary.

25:53.170 --> 25:57.249
Do you think that's true,
the way to discover a liar?

25:57.250 --> 25:59.419
No, it's bad psychology.

25:59.420 --> 26:00.709
How do you mean?

26:00.710 --> 26:04.039
"Ignore the words"?
Seriously?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.879
How does someone prove
their innocence

26:05.880 --> 26:08.499
without explaining
why they're innocent?

26:08.500 --> 26:11.039
And he says it's all about
detecting anxiety.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.039
Well, I don't care
how innocent you are,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.709
if a cop calls you in
for questioning,

26:15.710 --> 26:17.249
you're gonna be anxious.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.999
So what does anxiety prove?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.709
What if there is no cop?

26:21.710 --> 26:24.289
What if there is no
reason to be anxious?

26:24.290 --> 26:26.669
I don't know.
Everybody's different.

26:26.670 --> 26:29.420
Everybody's got their tell.
I don't...

26:30.620 --> 26:33.040
What?

26:41.420 --> 26:43.329
This isn't a small thing.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.289
This is a massive class action.

26:45.290 --> 26:47.419
Every multi-billion dollar
nationwide retailer

26:47.420 --> 26:49.879
is sending
middle-management

26:49.880 --> 26:51.919
to these seminars...
East Wing Running Shoes,

26:51.920 --> 26:54.249
Widespread Tech, B&X...

26:54.250 --> 26:56.789
I thought these seminars
were about training cops.

26:56.790 --> 26:58.209
That's how they were intended,

26:58.210 --> 27:00.169
but retail stores are
using the same techniques

27:00.170 --> 27:01.999
against their own employees,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.249
and it's just as likely
to result in a false positive.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.579
Barbara, what do you think?

27:06.580 --> 27:08.120
It's good.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.210
Go certify a class.

27:15.710 --> 27:17.249
We should put Bobby
on it with her.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.789
It's a big thing now.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.249
Who's on it with her right now?

27:20.250 --> 27:22.169
The new associate, Maia.
I'd keep her on it.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.329
Maia's good.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.499
And she's motivated.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.329
That Rindell kid?
Yes.

27:27.330 --> 27:28.330
Sure.

27:28.331 --> 27:30.379
Everybody hates her.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.499
Great way to mold a fighter.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.920
All right.

27:39.170 --> 27:40.170
There may not even be
a job here.

27:40.171 --> 27:42.120
I just want to warn you.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.499
Uh, you're here for the
assistant position?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.920
Come on in...
Daniela?

27:57.960 --> 27:59.080
Have a seat.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.829
This is still your case, Frank,

28:07.830 --> 28:09.999
but it's also now
a class action.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.169
So I don't pay anything?

28:11.170 --> 28:13.169
Right, and it's more likely

28:13.170 --> 28:14.379
that you'll get
a larger settlement,

28:14.380 --> 28:15.789
because these big companies

28:15.790 --> 28:17.169
will want to avoid
the embarrassment.

28:17.170 --> 28:18.419
Is this going
to move quickly now,

28:18.420 --> 28:20.539
because I'm having trouble
paying rent.

28:20.540 --> 28:23.209
We think the companies will try
to win this motion to dismiss.

28:23.210 --> 28:25.419
And if not, they'll
negotiate a settlement.

28:25.420 --> 28:28.169
All right, do I have
to sign something?
Yes.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.379
And, actually,
you can help us, Frank.

28:29.380 --> 28:31.329
We're looking for other workers

28:31.330 --> 28:33.829
who have had their wages
garnished, just like you.

28:33.830 --> 28:36.210
So, if you...
What is this case again?

28:37.420 --> 28:40.169
We're gathering a class
of retail workers

28:40.170 --> 28:43.209
who were wrongly accused
of stealing from their stores.

28:43.210 --> 28:44.960
Okay, got it.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.959
So are you coming back to work?

28:49.960 --> 28:51.379
Everybody misses you.

28:51.380 --> 28:52.539
No, I got another job.

28:52.540 --> 28:55.039
In fact, can you
help me out with it?

28:55.040 --> 28:56.419
You know everybody around here.

28:56.420 --> 28:59.039
Is there anybody in the mall
who had their wages cut?

28:59.040 --> 29:01.829
We're bringing a lawsuit against
all these big asshole companies,

29:01.830 --> 29:03.419
and I know you know
all the people here

29:03.420 --> 29:05.039
and how they complain.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.289
So is anybody bitching
about their paychecks?

29:07.290 --> 29:09.329
It's about people being
forced to confess

29:09.330 --> 29:12.249
that they stole clothing
or shoes or computers.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.289
So if you hear anything
from anybody, here's my card.

29:15.290 --> 29:17.039
Tell them to call me.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.379
What the hell are
you doing, Barbara?

29:30.380 --> 29:32.419
What am I doing?
I'm having a sandwich.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.289
You're dragging my
members into a class action.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.329
If this is about the salary
garnishing, we're not drag...

29:36.330 --> 29:38.289
You're pissing off management!

29:38.290 --> 29:40.919
We're on the eve of a
contract negotiation,

29:40.920 --> 29:42.329
and you're pissing
off management.

29:42.330 --> 29:44.169
It was a union-member
complaint.

29:44.170 --> 29:45.419
We are merely...
No, no, no, no.

29:45.420 --> 29:46.749
You convinced him

29:46.750 --> 29:48.209
to pursue a class action,

29:48.210 --> 29:49.959
because you wanted the money.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.289
You came into our offices
and asked for our help

29:52.290 --> 29:53.329
to collect a class...

29:53.330 --> 29:55.249
Those two did.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.169
Your contract
is with us.
Yes.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.039
And you employed us
to help your members and...

29:59.040 --> 30:01.249
As a gesture, merely.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.459
Uh, maybe your members
would like to know that.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.539
Seriously?

30:05.540 --> 30:07.919
That's how little
our contract means to you?

30:07.920 --> 30:09.289
You're threatening me?
God,

30:09.290 --> 30:10.879
if that's considered
a threat, friend,

30:10.880 --> 30:12.879
I would love to live
in your world.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.249
We won't pay a cent
for this class action,

30:15.250 --> 30:16.919
and we won't help in any way.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.080
So drop it.

30:23.830 --> 30:27.619
What are you gonna do?

30:27.620 --> 30:30.120
We're gonna find
another benefactor.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.619
So what do you have?

30:34.620 --> 30:37.499
A new suit.
Very last-minute.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.829
Class action against
12 nationwide retailers.

30:39.830 --> 30:42.879
I'll need financing
on, say, 140...

30:42.880 --> 30:44.119
How many in the class?

30:44.120 --> 30:45.749
We're gathering that
as we speak,

30:45.750 --> 30:47.079
but we think 20, maybe more.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.169
Sympathetic,
working-class families,

30:49.170 --> 30:50.170
all retail workers.

30:50.171 --> 30:52.169
Who's the test case?

30:52.170 --> 30:53.669
Top of page three.

30:53.670 --> 30:55.749
Frank Gwinn, 32 years old.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.209
Divorced father.

30:57.210 --> 30:59.329
Good witness.
College-educated.

30:59.330 --> 31:01.379
Worked at BMI selling shoes.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.619
No litigation in his
background, and no priors.

31:03.620 --> 31:06.789
Uh, he's delinquent on a loan.
It's a student loan.

31:06.790 --> 31:08.959
2012. He's making
payments again.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.249
Your proposal?

31:10.250 --> 31:13.039
You finance 600 billable hours

31:13.040 --> 31:14.539
for an initial
payment of $300,000.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.789
You'll have two exit ramps.
One,

31:16.790 --> 31:17.999
after the motion to dismiss.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.419
Two, six months into trial,

31:19.420 --> 31:21.379
if we even go that long.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.919
You share 40% of the award,

31:23.920 --> 31:27.330
up to $8 million.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.380
No.

31:32.170 --> 31:33.619
Why?

31:33.620 --> 31:35.379
You can't get better.

31:35.380 --> 31:38.379
Your motion to dismiss is in
front of Judge Kevin Drago?

31:38.380 --> 31:39.419
We've won in front
of him before.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.169
Our algorithm doesn't like him.

31:41.170 --> 31:42.289
Not for this case.

31:42.290 --> 31:44.119
Your algorithm's
not taking into account

31:44.120 --> 31:46.119
that I'm a fucking good lawyer.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.379
Don't swear, okay?

31:48.380 --> 31:50.040
It bugs out Jer.

31:52.330 --> 31:53.500
I'm sorry.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.579
Does your algorithm
even like this case?

31:58.580 --> 31:59.919
It does.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.749
Good optics,
good potential pay-out.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.289
It's just this judge.

32:03.290 --> 32:05.580
It's okay,
I will get you a new judge.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.669
How you gonna do that?

32:07.670 --> 32:10.000
I'm a good lawyer.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.619
We're going to court.

32:16.620 --> 32:19.379
Fuck the union, we will
finance this thing ourselves.

32:19.380 --> 32:20.579
You, I want you in court.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.209
Uh, uh, what is your name again?

32:22.210 --> 32:23.999
Maia.
Maia. Great.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.879
Second chair.
I... Well, thank you, sir.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.249
Unfortunately we've run
into a snag, Adrian.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.669
What?

32:29.670 --> 32:32.039
The class.
Without the union's help,

32:32.040 --> 32:34.079
we're having a little
trouble locating employees

32:34.080 --> 32:35.169
with garnished wages.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.379
Check crime reports.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.999
Any business missing back-stock

32:38.000 --> 32:40.379
they'd report it, right?
No. They tried that.

32:40.380 --> 32:42.169
Let's post fliers.
Let's check Reddit.

32:42.170 --> 32:45.249
Let's get creative.
I've told our financial partners

32:45.250 --> 32:47.579
that we would have 20 members in
the class, so let's get to it,

32:47.580 --> 32:50.619
all right?
Here's 23 employees
who were accused of theft

32:50.620 --> 32:52.209
by their employer and had
their wages garnished.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.289
And I have feelers out
to a dozen more.

32:54.290 --> 32:56.420
And there are two more people
here to be interviewed.

33:02.290 --> 33:04.379
Who is that?

33:04.380 --> 33:06.670
My new assistant.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.119
You want me to recuse myself?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.289
Yes, Your Honor.

33:16.290 --> 33:17.579
Regretfully.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.120
You don't like me, Counselor?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.829
No, I love you.

33:19.830 --> 33:22.039
At our firm, we speak
very highly of you

33:22.040 --> 33:24.039
all the time, Your Honor.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.079
But unfortunately,
in this instance,

33:25.080 --> 33:26.289
there is a conflict of interest.

33:26.290 --> 33:27.919
We're good here, Your Honor.

33:27.920 --> 33:28.620
No problem.

33:28.621 --> 33:30.919
Isn't this just
a motion to dismiss?

33:30.920 --> 33:32.419
I'm not sure how I can
be conflicted out.

33:32.420 --> 33:33.999
I've shopped at BMI,
but that's about it.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.079
And you, sir?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.539
Do I know you?

33:36.540 --> 33:37.709
No, Your Honor.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.419
Nice try, Mr. Boseman,

33:39.420 --> 33:42.709
but I reject your motion
to recuse me.

33:42.710 --> 33:43.919
We can start with
your first witness.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.289
Actually, Your Honor,

33:45.290 --> 33:46.210
there's one more thing.

33:46.211 --> 33:47.579
You're trying my patience, sir.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.829
Recently you lost over a million
dollars in an investment.

33:49.830 --> 33:51.419
Am I correct?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.289
That's none of your business.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.169
And that loss has nothing
to do with the matter here.

33:55.170 --> 33:56.499
Now sit down.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.669
But unfortunately,
our second chair here...

33:58.670 --> 34:01.500
Uh, Maia, would you stand up
and state your full name please?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.289
Maia Rindell.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.379
As you can see, Your Honor,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.668
since you've lost
most of your savings

34:10.670 --> 34:12.918
to the Rindell Ponzi scheme,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.580
you cannot fairly
judge this case.

34:17.380 --> 34:22.168
So here we all are on this
lovely Wednesday afternoon.

34:22.170 --> 34:24.998
And unfortunately,
I have misplaced

34:25.000 --> 34:27.119
my prescription glasses.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.119
So I will try to make do with
these prescription sunglasses,

34:30.120 --> 34:33.079
if you don't mind me looking
a little bit like a movie star.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.789
Very becoming, Your Honor.

34:35.790 --> 34:37.168
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.998
Coming from L.A.,
I'm used to it.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.458
Ah, Los Angeles.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.668
How is your drought?

34:41.670 --> 34:42.998
Uh, improving.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.079
Good. I love the way your state

34:45.080 --> 34:47.289
emphasizes green energy.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.329
Yes, I have a Tesla myself.

34:49.330 --> 34:50.789
It's such a wonderful car.

34:50.790 --> 34:52.789
Your Honor,
the motion to dismiss.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.498
Yes, thank you, Lucca.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.919
The simple fact is the
plaintiff is attempting to use

34:57.920 --> 35:01.079
the theft of 400 running shoes
from my client's...

35:01.080 --> 35:02.669
Not the theft.
There is no theft here.

35:02.670 --> 35:05.169
If I could finish?
Thank you.

35:05.170 --> 35:08.619
To sue 15 respected companies.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.209
In other words,
this is a Trojan Horse...

35:10.210 --> 35:12.419
Actually, the metaphor
I would use, Your Honor,

35:12.420 --> 35:14.209
is a reverse Robin Hood.
Seriously?

35:14.210 --> 35:16.169
Well, this is getting heated.

35:16.170 --> 35:17.789
My client makes $40,000 a year.

35:17.790 --> 35:20.079
Ms. Stevens' client
makes $13 billion.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.039
And yet every payday, they take
40% of his take home pay.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.249
Okay, well, battle lines drawn.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.749
Ms. Stevens, your,
your first witness.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.249
We had a lot of theft
from the store-room,

35:30.250 --> 35:32.879
almost $600,000 this year.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.169
So I was asked to question
the employees.

35:35.170 --> 35:37.169
And why did you zero in
on the plaintiff?

35:37.170 --> 35:39.249
He showed signs of deception
per the Friedman method.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.749
This is a
method utilized by the police

35:40.750 --> 35:42.669
to question suspects?
Yes.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.999
And the plaintiff signed
this confession?

35:45.000 --> 35:46.289
Yes.

35:46.290 --> 35:47.879
He told us exactly how

35:47.880 --> 35:49.879
he slipped the crates
into his car, took them down

35:49.880 --> 35:51.669
to Maxwell Street Market,
and sold them to a vendor

35:51.670 --> 35:53.419
- for $10,000.
- Thank you, Mr. Diyardian.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.209
He gave me that information.
Nothing more here,
Your Honor.

35:55.210 --> 35:57.249
Mike, could you angle
that screen some more?

35:57.250 --> 35:59.289
These sunglasses are polarized.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.249
Yeah, keep coming,
keep coming. Ah.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.120
Keep coming, keep coming.

36:02.121 --> 36:03.880
Oh, well...

36:06.120 --> 36:08.169
Uh, continue, please.

36:08.170 --> 36:10.249
Uh, just a few questions, Benji.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.959
Why didn't you tell
the police about the theft?

36:12.960 --> 36:15.209
Excuse me?

36:15.210 --> 36:17.039
Well, if it were me and I had

36:17.040 --> 36:20.289
$70,000 stolen, I
would go to the police.

36:20.290 --> 36:23.249
Well, the company would rather
settle these things internally.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.419
And I'd rather you call me
"Mr. Diyardian."

36:25.420 --> 36:27.499
Oh, my apologies.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.829
And Mr. Gwinn stole
this $70,000,

36:29.830 --> 36:31.669
according to your interrogation?

36:31.670 --> 36:32.540
My interview.

36:32.541 --> 36:35.119
Right, your interview.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.919
To your mind, Frank Gwinn
is a thief, right?

36:37.920 --> 36:42.169
Well, he stole, yes.
Then why didn't the
company fire him?

36:42.170 --> 36:45.459
Your Honor, I-I think
it's a little odd that BMI

36:45.460 --> 36:48.329
is being censured for doing
the humanitarian thing.

36:48.330 --> 36:50.209
Oh, I don't think plaintiff
is censuring them.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.829
I think she just finds it odd
that they kept the thief

36:52.830 --> 36:54.539
on staff, as do I.

36:54.540 --> 36:58.829
Well, the company just wanted
an opportunity to claw back

36:58.830 --> 37:01.079
its losses, didn't it?
Right, it did.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.829
So the company wanted
to keep Frank employed

37:03.830 --> 37:05.539
so they could take
from his paycheck?

37:05.540 --> 37:07.539
Is that right?
Well, that's not how I'd put it.

37:07.540 --> 37:10.000
How would you put it, Benji?
Please take your time.

37:12.170 --> 37:14.919
You're suggesting
bad motives here.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.619
But BMI thinks all its employees

37:16.620 --> 37:18.419
should be allowed
to make things right.

37:18.420 --> 37:23.539
And so, even though, Frank,
supposedly stole $70,000,

37:23.540 --> 37:25.119
he was still allowed
to work alone

37:25.120 --> 37:27.289
and unsupervised
in the backroom?

37:27.290 --> 37:29.209
Objection.
Asked and answered.

37:29.210 --> 37:32.120
Uh, actually, no, I'd like
to hear the answer.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.499
We trust our employees.
And that's why

37:35.500 --> 37:37.709
you questioned him
for seven hours?
Objection. Argumentative.

37:37.710 --> 37:40.419
I'll rephrase. How many hours
did you question my client?

37:40.420 --> 37:42.749
I don't know.
I didn't keep track.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.539
Well, uh...

37:44.540 --> 37:46.290
uh, it says seven hours here.

37:52.830 --> 37:55.119
Oh, hello, Lucca.
Good to see you're still at it.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.379
And it's um... Mai... I'm sorry,

37:59.380 --> 38:00.919
Mia.
Maia.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.959
Maia, thank you. Hi.
Hi.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.419
I'm Andrea.

38:04.420 --> 38:06.709
I'm so terribly sorry
about your family.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.459
Must be hard on you.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.039
It's manageable.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.079
Manageable.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.999
Good.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.709
Women are taking over the world,
piece by piece.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.919
Um, I'm wondering if you and
I could talk sometime, Lucca.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.459
We can talk right now.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.209
Well, I-I just

38:22.210 --> 38:24.880
hate doing it here
in a public place, but...

38:28.580 --> 38:31.879
So, what's the offer?

38:31.880 --> 38:33.579
Offer?

38:33.580 --> 38:37.249
No, I-I just wanted to know
where you got your hair cut.

38:37.250 --> 38:40.999
I just, I love
the bangs so much.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.169
A friend of mine.

38:42.170 --> 38:43.619
She cuts hair out
of her apartment.

38:43.620 --> 38:44.999
Really?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.289
Could you maybe
get me her number?

38:46.290 --> 38:47.379
Sure.

38:47.380 --> 38:48.669
Thank you.

38:48.670 --> 38:50.879
Gosh. Mm.
I love this, by the way.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.169
It would look great on you.

38:53.170 --> 38:54.459
Do you want to buy it?

38:54.460 --> 38:56.459
No.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.579
I'd sooner buy the
smile off the Mona Lisa.

39:01.170 --> 39:02.419
See you tomorrow.

39:02.420 --> 39:03.710
Bye, Mia.

39:13.460 --> 39:15.289
It was just was a scare.

39:15.290 --> 39:16.879
Dr. Trotter found another lump.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.539
But he thinks it's nothing.

39:18.540 --> 39:21.169
Good.
Is that why you called?

39:21.170 --> 39:22.459
Oh, yes, I mean,
I was told the cancer

39:22.460 --> 39:23.749
had spread to your lymph nodes.

39:23.750 --> 39:28.379
Well, that's the fear.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.879
It's good to see you, Maia.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.210
You look older.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.379
Look at me, Mom.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.749
Why?

39:42.750 --> 39:45.539
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.919
Oh, Maia, I spent the last two
weeks answering more questions

39:47.920 --> 39:49.209
than I have in my whole life.

39:49.210 --> 39:50.459
Yes. And I am your daughter.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.290
And I just want to ask you
a few more.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.170
Look at me.

39:56.790 --> 39:59.080
Okay, I'm looking at you.

40:01.670 --> 40:03.169
Was there really a cancer scare?

40:03.170 --> 40:06.539
Yes, baby,

40:06.540 --> 40:08.919
there was a cancer scare.

40:08.920 --> 40:12.209
And you're not lying to me?

40:12.210 --> 40:14.460
I'm your mother.

40:16.170 --> 40:18.079
Is Dad guilty?

40:18.080 --> 40:19.210
You know he's not.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.919
Are you guilty?

40:23.920 --> 40:27.879
No, Maia, I'm not guilty.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.709
Uncle Jax is guilty.

40:30.710 --> 40:33.879
You just need to trust me, baby.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.540
We're family.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.460
I don't know
if she's lying or not.

40:43.330 --> 40:45.669
About the cancer?

40:45.670 --> 40:48.709
No, about the fund.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.209
Do you think your dad did it?

40:53.210 --> 40:56.119
I don't know.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.879
We were always
the boring family.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.169
I mean,

41:01.170 --> 41:03.119
all my friends, their...

41:03.120 --> 41:05.959
their parents were divorcing

41:05.960 --> 41:10.039
or having affairs and...

41:10.040 --> 41:13.459
I used to lie about
Mom and Dad fighting,

41:13.460 --> 41:16.459
so that I wouldn't
seem so weird.

41:18.040 --> 41:22.539
And now...

41:22.540 --> 41:25.580
it's like we're paying for
all those years of happiness.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.619
That's your parents.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.379
Doesn't have to be you.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.460
You can be as happy as you want.

41:40.170 --> 41:41.579
And we're back.

41:41.580 --> 41:44.209
Now, here's the thing,
young man.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.210
No, you can all sit down.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.539
I have a question for you.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.539
What is supination?

41:48.540 --> 41:50.169
I was buying
running shoes yesterday

41:50.170 --> 41:52.379
and they told me
my feet supinate?

41:52.380 --> 41:53.999
Yeah, uh, supination

41:54.000 --> 41:55.999
is when your feet roll outward
when you run.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.999
Oh, and that's a bad thing?
Yes, it can be a bad thing.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.789
But that's why you need shoes
with a firmer outer sole.

41:59.790 --> 42:02.079
Ah. Shoes like these?

42:02.080 --> 42:04.329
Uh, Your Honor, um,

42:04.330 --> 42:06.119
we do have a witness,
but if you're feeling biased

42:06.120 --> 42:07.709
towards the plaintiff,
we ask that we be heard

42:07.710 --> 42:08.749
on a recusal.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.039
No, no. No, counselor.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.289
I'm just getting some advice.

42:11.290 --> 42:12.329
My apologies.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.329
I will work hard toward
neither supinating

42:14.330 --> 42:17.169
nor pronating
toward one side or the other.

42:17.170 --> 42:18.669
Your next witness.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.619
The interviewer
merely tries to ease the way

42:20.620 --> 42:23.169
for a liar to admit
the truth, that's all.

42:23.170 --> 42:26.079
So you tend
to minimize the crime?

42:26.080 --> 42:27.539
Yes.

42:27.540 --> 42:28.959
According to Mr. Diyardian's
own testimony,

42:28.960 --> 42:30.119
he made it clear to the suspect

42:30.120 --> 42:31.749
that the theft
was not a big matter.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.289
They just wanted to solve it.

42:33.290 --> 42:35.619
In fact, he could understand
why someone would be tempted.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.039
He was even tempted.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.289
And the plaintiff has suggested

42:38.290 --> 42:40.419
that Mr. Diyardian
handed all the details

42:40.420 --> 42:42.709
of the flea market sale
to Mr. Gwinn?

42:42.710 --> 42:45.669
Yes, but that's
just part of our method.

42:45.670 --> 42:48.039
Making it clear to the suspect
you know all the particulars

42:48.040 --> 42:50.289
of his crime helps him
feel there is no way

42:50.290 --> 42:51.709
to avoid detection.

42:51.710 --> 42:53.959
And this is the same method
used by police

42:53.960 --> 42:55.669
to catch criminals?

42:55.670 --> 42:58.169
Yes, definitely.
It is tried and tested.

42:58.170 --> 43:00.119
All done here, Your Honor.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.540
Do you want to do it?

43:07.380 --> 43:08.919
Well, if you don't want to.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.500
No. No, I want to.

43:28.750 --> 43:30.709
Mr. Le Frenais.

43:30.710 --> 43:32.749
<i>La </i> Frenais.

43:32.750 --> 43:35.289
La Frenais.

43:35.290 --> 43:39.379
Is it part of your method

43:39.380 --> 43:42.619
that you can lie to the suspect?

43:42.620 --> 43:45.079
Sorry, Counselor.
You, uh... Can you speak up?

43:45.080 --> 43:48.039
I think that Lisa is having
problems hearing you.

43:48.040 --> 43:50.079
Yes.
Of course.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.669
Is it part
of your Friedman method, sir,

43:53.670 --> 43:56.709
that you can lie to the suspect
being questioned?

43:56.710 --> 43:58.919
Whoa. Much better, thank you.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.879
It's not part of my method.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.789
It's part of the Supreme Court
decision, <i>Frazier vs. Cupp.</i>

44:03.790 --> 44:06.959
Police officers
can lie to suspects.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.669
And so in step number five
of your method,

44:10.670 --> 44:14.419
the interviewer is to present
evidence of culpability

44:14.420 --> 44:18.329
to the suspect,
whether it's true or not?

44:18.330 --> 44:20.410
Well, it's better if
the evidence is true, of course.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.330
But it doesn't have to be?

44:24.620 --> 44:25.789
No.

44:25.790 --> 44:28.829
So when Benji presented Frank

44:28.830 --> 44:30.619
with a DVD recording
of him stealing

44:30.620 --> 44:34.039
the $70,000 in running shoes...

44:34.040 --> 44:36.749
a DVD that was completely blank,

44:36.750 --> 44:38.789
by the way...

44:38.790 --> 44:42.669
that was A-okay with you?

44:42.670 --> 44:46.039
Yes, if it helps
find a crook, yes.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.539
But doesn't your method result

44:47.540 --> 44:48.829
in false confessions?

44:48.830 --> 44:50.039
Very few.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.119
In fact, hasn't your method

44:52.120 --> 44:54.039
been banned by police

44:54.040 --> 44:56.039
in Canada and England?

44:56.040 --> 44:59.459
I wouldn't call it banned.
They've chosen not to use it.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.919
Oh, because it resulted
in too many false confessions?

45:01.920 --> 45:02.830
I don't think that's fair.

45:02.831 --> 45:05.000
But is it true, sir?

45:06.670 --> 45:10.079
I'll leave
that analysis to others.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.329
Analysis. What...

45:11.330 --> 45:12.619
"The Friedman Method

45:12.620 --> 45:15.789
"is a banned coercive technique
of interrogation

45:15.790 --> 45:18.879
"that results
in too many false confessions.

45:18.880 --> 45:23.539
It is therefore banned
within our jurisdiction."

45:23.540 --> 45:24.709
Do you mean analysis like that?

45:24.710 --> 45:26.249
Who wrote that?

45:26.250 --> 45:28.249
Melissa Starr.

45:28.250 --> 45:30.499
London Metropolitan Police.
Scotland Yard.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.829
Okay.

45:31.830 --> 45:32.830
Uh...

45:32.831 --> 45:35.619
Anything further?

45:35.620 --> 45:37.209
Nothing here, Your Honor.

45:37.210 --> 45:38.920
Thank you.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.959
Hi. This is Diane Lockhart's
office,

46:00.960 --> 46:03.999
and I'm her assistant, Marissa.
How may I help you?

46:04.000 --> 46:07.039
It's Dr. Ainsworth
at Harbor Hospital.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.999
- Do you want to call him back?
- Please.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.919
Diane. You didn't like
any of the applicants?

46:11.920 --> 46:14.249
Oh, for the assistant's job?

46:14.250 --> 46:16.999
Uh, no, I did.
It's just that I know Marissa,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.079
and she's on the
ball. She's good.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.250
You'll see.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.619
Okay. This is our offer.

46:27.620 --> 46:28.919
$500,000 to Frank Gwinn.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.039
No class action.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.499
If the firm pursues
a class action,

46:32.500 --> 46:34.180
our offer goes away
and Frank gets nothing.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.169
Lot of money
for a guy pulling in

46:37.170 --> 46:38.669
40 grand a year.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.710
Mm-hmm.

46:41.830 --> 46:44.250
What do you think of that, Maia?

46:46.460 --> 46:51.209
I think we'll have
to get back to you.

46:51.210 --> 46:53.419
Okay.

46:53.420 --> 46:55.499
In the next, uh, two hours,

46:55.500 --> 46:57.460
or we go back to court,
and destroy you.

47:00.040 --> 47:01.419
Ms. Stevens.

47:01.420 --> 47:03.999
Yeah.
I have an answer
for you now.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.999
Oh. Great.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.880
My hair stylist's number.

47:16.290 --> 47:18.080
Well?

47:19.120 --> 47:21.669
We got a decision to make.

47:21.670 --> 47:23.709
No. It's not enough money
for us to take.

47:23.710 --> 47:26.039
It's not your decision.
It's the client's.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.579
No. It's a decision
for the whole class:

47:27.580 --> 47:29.249
all 24 clients.

47:29.250 --> 47:30.709
The algorithm says we stay in.

47:30.710 --> 47:32.039
This is crazy.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.999
You can't have them
decide what we do.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.119
They're paying the bills, Lucca.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.669
Yes, but Frank needs the money.

47:37.670 --> 47:40.539
If we pass on this,
he could get nothing.

47:40.540 --> 47:42.079
Or he could get
a whole lot more.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.330
Let's just wait and see.

47:48.500 --> 47:51.709
I just have one last
question for you, Frank.

47:51.710 --> 47:53.289
Why did you confess?

47:53.290 --> 47:57.329
If you didn't do it,
then why would you confess?

47:57.330 --> 47:59.749
He made it seem
like it was the only way out.

47:59.750 --> 48:01.289
He he had a DVD of me doing it.

48:01.290 --> 48:03.749
And if you knew there
was nothing on that DVD,

48:03.750 --> 48:05.579
then why would you confess?

48:05.580 --> 48:07.419
I felt helpless.

48:07.420 --> 48:08.959
I was exhausted.

48:08.960 --> 48:11.459
He had me convinced that
I just repressed the memory.

48:11.460 --> 48:13.249
He said he had
a witness who swore

48:13.250 --> 48:14.919
that I was down at a flea
market, selling the shoes.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.459
Were you?
No. But he said
he was gonna give

48:17.460 --> 48:19.459
all this to the cops if I didn't
come clean to the company.

48:19.460 --> 48:20.999
Come clean, meaning?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.999
Sign this statement
that he wrote up.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.419
And so you signed it?
Yes. He said
that I could keep my job,

48:25.420 --> 48:27.539
he said that the questioning
would be over.

48:27.540 --> 48:29.959
He said that I would still be
on management track.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.999
Did you know
that Benji gets a bonus

48:32.000 --> 48:34.169
for every employee
he gets to confess?

48:34.170 --> 48:36.209
Objection. No foundation.

48:36.210 --> 48:38.169
Uh, that is definitely
sustained.

48:38.170 --> 48:40.329
Okay, um, I think

48:40.330 --> 48:41.669
I'm ready to rule
on this motion.

48:41.670 --> 48:42.999
Uh, Your Honor,

48:43.000 --> 48:44.329
I'd like to cross-examine.

48:44.330 --> 48:45.669
This is not a full trial.

48:45.670 --> 48:47.249
This is merely
a motion to dismiss.

48:47.250 --> 48:48.919
Yeah, I know, but this
information just came

48:48.920 --> 48:50.999
into our hands. We were hoping
to use it at trial,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.039
but we think we can save the
court a lot of time and money

48:54.040 --> 48:56.119
if we could ask it now.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.119
I... am enticed.

48:59.120 --> 49:01.669
Thank you, Your Honor.

49:01.670 --> 49:04.539
Mr. Gwinn,
where did you work before BMI?

49:04.540 --> 49:07.079
Various places.
I worked as a temp.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.079
And was one these places
Tolleson Accounting?

49:09.080 --> 49:11.119
Yes.
You had a clerical job there?

49:11.120 --> 49:12.709
Uh-huh.

49:12.710 --> 49:16.079
Uh-huh...
I'll take that as a yes.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.419
And were you asked to leave?

49:18.420 --> 49:20.119
I didn't do it.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.919
Yeah. I think you know
what's coming, Frank.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.119
There was a petty cash
situation,

49:24.120 --> 49:26.210
several hundred dollars?

49:27.960 --> 49:29.459
And were you accused
of taking it?

49:29.460 --> 49:30.669
I told them I didn't take it.

49:30.670 --> 49:32.119
But you agreed to leave

49:32.120 --> 49:33.080
if they didn't call the cops?

49:33.081 --> 49:35.119
Objection,
there is no record of this.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.539
Our investigators
questioned this business.

49:38.540 --> 49:40.039
Yes, because the manager
at the time

49:40.040 --> 49:42.419
talked only to our investigator,

49:42.420 --> 49:44.829
and signed this affidavit.

49:44.830 --> 49:47.329
I didn't do it.
In it, he swears
that Frank took the money,

49:47.330 --> 49:48.619
then when he was caught,
promised to return it

49:48.620 --> 49:50.249
if they kept the theft secret.

49:50.250 --> 49:52.039
That's a lie!

49:52.040 --> 49:53.709
That's a complete and total lie.

49:53.710 --> 49:56.249
Okay. That is information

49:56.250 --> 49:57.829
I will take into consideration.

49:57.830 --> 49:59.209
Does the defendant have
any more questions?

49:59.210 --> 50:01.039
Nothing more, Your Honor.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.329
Unless the plaintiff
has anything more,

50:03.330 --> 50:05.120
I will rule on this motion.

50:09.830 --> 50:12.999
I hate losing.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.249
It was a good effort.

50:15.250 --> 50:17.459
Does this impact the class?

50:17.460 --> 50:20.119
Yes, unfortunately.

50:20.120 --> 50:23.709
The litigation financiers
dropped out.

50:23.710 --> 50:25.619
I thought he was telling
the truth.

50:25.620 --> 50:26.879
Well, maybe he was.

50:26.880 --> 50:28.619
About the running shoes.

50:28.620 --> 50:32.039
You know, people can lie
and still be telling the truth.

50:32.040 --> 50:35.420
Nobody's a hundred percent
of any one thing.

50:38.500 --> 50:41.120
My mom lied about her cancer.

50:43.250 --> 50:44.749
It was a scare.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.169
It wasn't real.

50:46.170 --> 50:49.040
She just wanted to see me.

50:52.750 --> 50:56.039
She's lonely.

50:56.040 --> 50:59.289
People get desperate
when they're lonely.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.580
You should go see her.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.750
Mom?

51:14.960 --> 51:17.960
Mom?

51:20.420 --> 51:22.039
Maia, what are you doing?

51:22.040 --> 51:23.829
I wanted to see how you were.

51:23.830 --> 51:25.539
Good.

51:25.540 --> 51:27.749
I was just going to bed.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.419
What's wrong?

51:30.420 --> 51:33.580
Why don't we have breakfast
tomorrow?

51:34.880 --> 51:36.539
Whose car is that outside?

51:36.540 --> 51:39.619
Just the painters were here
yesterday. They left one.

51:39.620 --> 51:41.670
Where's the tea, Lenore?

51:46.420 --> 51:48.330
It's not a good time.

51:50.120 --> 51:51.579
Hi, Uncle Jax.
