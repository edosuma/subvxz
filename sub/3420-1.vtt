04:13.988 --> 04:15.354
Where you been?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.990
Sorry, Jerry.
Is Sal still here?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.760
You were supposed to
be here an hour ago.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.862
Now he's at the produce.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.784
When Sal tells
you to be somewhere,
you fucking be there.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.402
Think you could
give me a ride?

04:30.404 --> 04:31.603
Fucking A, Nicky.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.605
Go!

04:33.574 --> 04:35.294
- Go! Go!
- All right.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.312
Man,
I need my own fucking wheels.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.648
Yeah, you do.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.983
You should have kept
that Chrysler, man.
That was a good car.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.786
Hmm.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.788
My brother needed
some money for school,
you know?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.670
Will you please
leave it on one station?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.626
Fuck you.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.999
$86.
Fuck, I told Vito I'd stop by
with some dough.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.735
Man,
we need a good fucking rip.
You got anything?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.103
Things been kind
of cold lately.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.839
I got a vic up north.
It's a home invasion.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.542
Like a drug deal or something?

05:43.544 --> 05:46.611
Nah. Straight guy. He owns
two sports bars up
in New Hampshire.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.681
Wife, two kids.
250K in his mattress.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.683
I got a tip from
his financial advisor.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.853
Financial advisor?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.356
Yeah, I sell
the guy coke and steroids
from time to time.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.358
That sounds like
a guy you can trust
with your money.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.427
No. What else?

06:02.428 --> 06:03.794
I got a...

06:03.797 --> 06:07.399
I got a number for a bookie,
big fish kind of guy.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.968
Figured I'd throw
in some high numbers,
see what happens and...

06:09.970 --> 06:11.970
With your fucking Irish luck,
no fucking way.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.839
-That has nothing
to do with luck.
-Next.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.707
- What are you talking about?
- Next!

06:15.709 --> 06:18.349
Jesus, Nicky,
let me see what else I got
on the fucking lot for you.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.115
Uh, Big Victor. I've been
waiting for that to get
ripe for a while.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.317
Probably get him for
25 grand this week.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.953
Big Victor.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.154
I don't know, man.
We'd have to
give him a beating.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.989
So what?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.624
What we need is
our own fucking crew.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.743
- Our own crew...
- Come on, man.

06:34.744 --> 06:36.861
...and we won't be up
against the ropes
all the fucking time.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.830
You know what? You watched
the first half of
<i>Goodfellas</i> too many times.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.649
Those days are dead, man.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.467
Nowadays,
a crew makes you hot.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.870
Your friends in the North End?
Just a bunch of old guys now

06:44.872 --> 06:46.671
that fucking play gangster

06:46.673 --> 06:50.008
so they can fucking sell ziti
and fucking cannolis
to tourists.

06:50.010 --> 06:50.976
What the fuck are
you talking about?

06:50.978 --> 06:52.644
Sal fucking
runs the North End.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.146
Sal ran the North End
20 years ago.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.047
Have you looked
around recently?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.549
It's like a guinea
minstrel show over there.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.584
It's like a dago Disney World.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.421
Trust me.
Those guys are geriatric rats
on a fucking sinking ship.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.488
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about,

07:03.490 --> 07:05.257
all right?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.025
Will you please hurry up?
Sal's gonna kick
my fucking ass.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.059
Fuck Sal.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.814
We load and lock.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.818
This one's filled up.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.810
Yeah, why don't you grab it?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.663
You send me that number?

07:44.665 --> 07:45.905
Yeah, we're good.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.614
Hey, Angelo.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.896
Hey, Nick, how's it going?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.723
Okay. Well, can you
let me know by next week

08:11.725 --> 08:14.092
which way you want
to go with this thing?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.974
Otherwise I just
got to proceed.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.323
Wait here for me. All right?

08:42.589 --> 08:43.138
Come here.

08:43.139 --> 08:44.819
- Sal, I...
- Get over there.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.579
I'm so sorry
that I'm late, Sal.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.068
Why?

08:57.070 --> 09:00.270
I could smell
the pussy coming off you
halfway down the hallway.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.910
I got a call last night

09:04.912 --> 09:06.144
from Tony Matazano.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.849
What happened?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.694
I get a call
yesterday afternoon
from my cousin Eric.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.757
Something about
Tony's daughter

09:18.759 --> 09:21.793
chewing him out
at the hair salon
that he works at.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.195
She was bitching about him
smoking too close to the door

09:24.197 --> 09:25.564
or something stupid like that.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.998
Anyway, he called her a name.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
She got pissed.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.104
Tony sends his
fucking goons down there
to rough up my cousin.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.575
He's a kid, Sal.
He was shitting in his pants.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.457
So I call Tony,
try to calm things down.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.616
Did you tell him
you were going
to track him down

09:44.618 --> 09:46.284
and put a bullet in his eye?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.853
He started in on me
with all this tough guy shit.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.022
Like, "I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill your family."
I mean...

09:51.024 --> 09:52.757
Eric is a kid.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.679
And he's family.
Tony is a prick.

09:57.331 --> 10:00.599
All I was trying
to do was apologize.
That's it.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.767
Well, now you have to
go down there and apologize.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.069
In person.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.911
And to his daughter.
In person.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.639
Tony's protected. Nick.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.316
He makes us a lot of money.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.814
You know that he's
holding out on you.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.282
He's running all
this shit on the side
you don't even know about.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.404
I bet he never even...

10:20.087 --> 10:22.020
Hey, Mickey Mouse.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.154
Wait outside.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.184
You really want to associate
with people like that?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.135
He came out of
his mother's ass.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.871
I never would have survived
them three years up in
Shirley without George.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.873
Get your ass
over to his place.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.698
And watch your
fucking mouth with me.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.730
If you want in,
you better listen more
than you don't listen.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.455
And don't take everything
so fucking personally.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.226
You got a lot of heart, Nick.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.928
Don't let it go to your head.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.970
Whatever I got
to do, I'm ready.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.370
You know, Ginsberg,
the lawyer that just left...

11:14.074 --> 11:15.834
- You know...
- Sure. Good guy.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.180
Listen, Nick.

11:23.383 --> 11:27.052
With the old timers dying,
one by one,

11:27.054 --> 11:30.889
and the Feds and the rats
and the chinks and the fucking
Albanians up my ass,

11:30.891 --> 11:35.260
I got no choice
but to go legit

11:35.262 --> 11:37.228
or be the last man standing.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.365
We're like an island. <i> Capisce?</i>

11:42.335 --> 11:44.469
There's not many of us left.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.338
Whatever you want
me to do, I'm ready.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.741
I never was one of those guys
who just let anybody in

11:50.911 --> 11:53.211
who'd come through the door.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.213
But I paid the price. I know.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.948
I see something in you.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.832
The day you see it yourself
is the day things will go
right with this family.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.124
You're a good boy, Nick.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.459
Your time's coming.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.835
And bring
the girl some flowers.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.443
Vito.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.879
What's up, Nicky?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.084
How are you, brother?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.988
What's up, Georgie?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.490
Vito, when are you gonna do
something about that haircut?

12:38.492 --> 12:39.924
The pompadour died with Elvis.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.326
Fuck you.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.895
What's up, Eric, you dumb ass?

12:43.897 --> 12:45.396
You know I got to go deal
with your shit right now?

12:45.398 --> 12:46.398
What shit?

12:47.534 --> 12:50.001
You're the one with
the big fucking mouth.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.936
Bitch wanted to fuck
and I just wouldn't play.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.404
This kid couldn't get pussy
from a dead whore. Shut up.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.873
Suck a dick, Vito.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.155
What trouble? What do you got?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.244
Don't worry about it.
Here you go. Take this.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.112
No. Nick, you're not
even supposed be here.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.247
Where is he?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.048
He's in the house.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.170
I can't take that.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.060
What, you don't got to eat?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.996
You don't want
to go to college?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.226
He gets a fucking job,
he can bitch about
getting free money.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.261
I'm gonna go talk to him.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.163
No, he don't want you here.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.264
You cause problems for me
every time you come.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.146
- I got to deal with him.
- Hey, hey, hey.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.536
This is my house, too.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.698
Ma would want me here.
It's 80 fucking dollars.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.007
Take.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.111
Relax, will you?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.915
It's gonna be beautiful.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.383
All right,
don't let that big fat cock

13:38.385 --> 13:39.951
- scare the neighbors,
all right?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.020
- King Kong.
- All right.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.155
Hey, Nicky,
can I have some money, too?

13:54.901 --> 13:57.135
Pearls before swine,
you fucking pig.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.369
You're fucking pitiful.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.607
It's gonna be beautiful.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.045
Let's get out of here.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.266
- Here, let me borrow that.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.028
Yeah, just give me a second.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.387
Hey, Tony,
what's with the spandex?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.923
Don't you want
the back of your
ball bag tanned?

15:49.082 --> 15:49.614
What's up?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.735
Who's there? Who's that?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.185
It's the guy Sal sent over.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.147
Oh, the big mouth.
Hey, big mouth.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.058
You better hope my
kid don't catch cancer

16:00.060 --> 16:02.140
from your dumb fuck cousin's
cigarette fumes.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.037
Come here.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.007
Come on, a little closer.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.889
- Don't be shy.
- I'm fine right here.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.981
Come back, finish me later.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.487
I'm going mobile with this.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.256
Pretty girl gives you
a tan in your home...

16:34.094 --> 16:35.259
...and sucks you off.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.331
Good idea?

16:45.038 --> 16:46.118
Sure. Whatever you say.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.705
Whatever I say?

16:49.376 --> 16:50.408
Whatever I say.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.612
I say

16:56.483 --> 16:58.723
you're a dirt bag.
That's what I say.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.287
What do you say?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.675
- I say you're right.
- You're right I'm right.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.713
Say, aren't you here
to get down on your knees

17:15.801 --> 17:17.035
and suck my dick?

17:18.304 --> 17:19.304
Is that right?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.224
I'm just kidding.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.380
Not really.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.652
I'm here because you and I,
we got mutual friends.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.357
And out of respect
for those friends,
I've come here to apologize.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.359
So there you go.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.795
There you go.
Okay, pretty boy. One...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.400
We don't have mutual friends.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.604
You,
you're just a wannabe punk
for Salvatore Vitaglia.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.407
You don't got your button,
so quit pretending.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.710
Not yet.

18:00.113 --> 18:03.081
Not... Not yet?

18:03.083 --> 18:08.453
I think I heard the sound
of a little piece
of shit talking to me

18:08.455 --> 18:11.422
without a sincere apology.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.393
Sincere... You hear
a sincere apology, Joe?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.219
This is Joe.
Joe don't talk much,

18:22.502 --> 18:23.742
except with his eyeballs.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.472
What his eyeballs say,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.842
blow your mind.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.644
You ever have your
mind blown, Nick?
Ever?

18:36.116 --> 18:40.184
Look, Tony, I come
here to apologize to you.
All right?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.634
What else do you want from me?

18:45.892 --> 18:46.892
You know,

18:48.561 --> 18:52.230
I like cocaine very much.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.867
I like ladies with big tits
rubbing them all in my face.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.889
I like Italian cars.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.705
I like Irish whiskey.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.708
I like things all men like

19:03.710 --> 19:06.511
but are afraid to admit
to their girlfriend
or their wife

19:06.513 --> 19:08.553
for fear she'll make
him sleep on the couch.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.523
I like the couch.
It's relaxing.

19:13.820 --> 19:18.189
I don't need a man cave
in the basement

19:18.191 --> 19:21.225
with flat screen TV,
video game,

19:21.227 --> 19:24.829
hiding out like
some fucking mouse.

19:24.831 --> 19:29.433
I don't need a fucking
man cave because
the whole fucking world,

19:30.603 --> 19:31.683
that's my man cave.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.188
You have a man cave, Nick?

19:37.944 --> 19:38.944
No.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.716
Nick, come here.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.187
Come on, come on.
Just come on.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.455
I want you to tell me
what you think of me.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.667
The truth. You seem like a guy
who tells the truth. Come on.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.884
Come on, Nick. Blow my mind.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.477
The truth?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.217
I think...

20:19.919 --> 20:22.119
I think today if you're
rich and you're Italian,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.137
that makes you a gangster.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.227
Like on some TV show.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.334
What?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.403
You mean, I'm a TV show?
I'm a TV show?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.340
I'm a TV show?

20:46.512 --> 20:48.913
Apologize for insulting me,

20:49.849 --> 20:52.650
you fucking asshole!

21:04.497 --> 21:07.577
Mr. Matazano,
I am sincerely sorry
for acting so out of line.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.614
I meant you no disrespect.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.671
Please accept my
sincerest apology.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.814
Get out of here. Go on.

21:27.954 --> 21:32.823
You tell that
dipshit mongoloid
cousin of yours,

21:32.825 --> 21:36.060
if he fucks with my
daughter again, I'll rip
his fucking throat out.

21:46.072 --> 21:50.041
You... Hey! I fucking
saw that, cocksucker!

21:56.716 --> 21:58.082
All right, let's go! Let's go!

21:58.084 --> 22:00.318
Start the fucking car, George!

22:00.320 --> 22:02.053
- Come on, George!
- What?

22:02.055 --> 22:04.488
We gotta fucking go!

22:04.490 --> 22:06.279
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

22:06.280 --> 22:08.069
- They're right behind me.
Can we go?

22:08.070 --> 22:09.859
-Who them? Man, I'm fucking...
-Drive the fucking car!
Do your fucking job!

22:09.862 --> 22:12.330
When you fucking bug out...
Fuck you!

22:20.573 --> 22:21.939
Why are we stopped?

22:26.646 --> 22:28.886
Swear to God, George.
Why are we fucking stopped?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.033
You know, Nicky,
you're the only guy I know

22:32.034 --> 22:34.274
who goes into a titty bar
to suck a fucking cock.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.787
What? You think that
I wanted to go do that?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.689
I had to, all right?

22:38.691 --> 22:41.692
You didn't have to.
You fucking chose to.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.661
Look, you wanna be
a part of that whole thing

22:43.662 --> 22:45.629
and eat a plate of shit
every time these guys fucking
serve it up to you?

22:45.631 --> 22:48.432
Go right ahead.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.835
Just don't expect me to be
sitting there with a fork
and knife next to you.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.887
And I'll tell
you another thing.

22:52.888 --> 22:54.938
If that fuck crosses me again,

22:54.941 --> 22:56.574
-I'll fucking bury him.
-All right,
all right, all right.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.736
- Fucking apple face.
- All right, all right.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.447
Look, I know. All right?

23:03.449 --> 23:04.615
But don't worry about it.
Sal's gonna make...

23:04.617 --> 23:06.016
Sal's gonna what?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.858
Is that your new mantra?
"Sal's gonna"?

23:10.022 --> 23:12.757
You know,
I don't gotta join a club
to know who my friends are.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.959
It's not about
fucking friends.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.459
It's about business.
All right?

23:15.461 --> 23:16.827
No, it's about
business with me.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.130
With you, who knows
what the fuck it's about?

23:19.132 --> 23:20.798
You got all these
fucking big ideas.
You know what I got?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.600
I got little ideas.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.722
And they keep me
fed and not dead.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.639
Can you please get me
the fuck out of here?

23:57.170 --> 23:58.170
Hey.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.871
Ali here?

24:02.675 --> 24:03.755
What can I get for you?

24:04.877 --> 24:06.210
Let me get a whiskey sour.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.502
$6.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.219
Keep the change.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.157
You Ali?

24:54.994 --> 24:55.994
Who's asking?

24:56.896 --> 24:57.896
I'm Nick.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.030
Okay. What's up?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.235
I heard from your father
there was some kind of
problem with my cousin

25:04.237 --> 25:06.437
at the hair salon you
were at the other day.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.287
I'm here to apologize for him.

25:15.982 --> 25:16.964
You're apologizing for him?

25:16.965 --> 25:17.947
Well, I don't have
a problem with you.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.270
It's your little shit cousin
that called me a cunt.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.819
And who cares, anyway?

25:25.191 --> 25:25.873
I care.

25:25.874 --> 25:27.754
The person I
work for, he cares.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.894
It was an insult to
you and to your father.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.736
I'd like to try
to make amends.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.100
My father's insultable.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.642
What are these?

25:45.244 --> 25:47.745
They're for you.
They're flowers.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.587
What am I
supposed to do with them?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.122
I don't know.
Put them in water.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.201
Wait. Look. Okay.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.824
I know there are
better flowers.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.706
Oh, really?
Why didn't you
bring them, then?

26:06.799 --> 26:07.799
Next time.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.235
Next time.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.477
What was your name again?

26:13.773 --> 26:14.853
Nick. Nick Tortano.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.042
Okay, Niccolo.

26:18.044 --> 26:21.145
You go back and
you tell your boss
that everything's fine.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.987
You'll live to
see another day.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.315
Whoa, whoa...

26:24.317 --> 26:26.584
Just... Hang on. Hang on.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.021
You gotta let me
do this the right way.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.202
Miss Matazano,

26:45.204 --> 26:48.364
I am sincerely sorry my cousin
was acting so disrespectful
and out of line.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.596
It was
completely inappropriate.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.276
I hope you can accept
my sincerest apology.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.192
Okay.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.163
Thank you.

27:13.766 --> 27:14.846
That was really nice.

27:22.675 --> 27:23.955
And thank you for the flowers.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.745
Hey.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.561
You wanna go out with me?

27:43.295 --> 27:44.375
Not in a million years.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.134
What's up, brother?

28:45.491 --> 28:46.731
I thought you
were coming alone.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.792
You gonna bust my balls?

28:48.794 --> 28:51.075
I'm not allowed to have
a friend in the world?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.171
It's me. Let me in, Victor.

28:55.735 --> 28:56.815
All right, come in.

28:57.737 --> 28:58.802
Fucking asshole.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.060
Victor, you know Nick? No?

29:11.117 --> 29:12.877
Yeah, yeah,
we met a couple of times.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.918
- How you been?
- Good.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.320
Yeah?

29:16.322 --> 29:17.402
You wanna line of coke?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.758
No, thanks, I'm good.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.259
Are you sure?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.061
This shit's cut
with creatine, man. It's fire.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.124
Well, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna do a line.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.902
Ooh.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.406
Hey, Victor, where's Blackie?
He don't live
with you no more?

29:36.408 --> 29:38.776
What was that? Huh?

29:38.778 --> 29:40.344
I said,
where's Blackie? He don't
live with you no more?

29:40.346 --> 29:42.466
No, no. Not since
he got sent upstate.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.815
It's all right, though.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.283
He's too into himself,
you know what I mean?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.118
A real narcissist.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.388
I can't be surrounding myself
with people like that anymore.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.550
Fuck! Where are my manners?
Do you guys want
a beverage or something?

29:55.161 --> 29:57.561
I'm good, I'm good. Thanks.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.962
But Blackie,
you should've seen him
when he got arrested.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.399
The fucking guy
started crying
like a little bitch.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.401
Fucking idiot.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.503
Now, he's in the union.
Fucking union job.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.272
Who wouldn't want a union job?

30:08.274 --> 30:10.207
Like I don't want a union job?

30:10.209 --> 30:11.875
I'd love a union job.
Making 1,800 a week.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.911
I'd never fuck that up.

30:13.913 --> 30:18.248
He's full of it.
Always talking big talk.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.917
I fucking...
I never understand
guys like that, you know?

30:19.919 --> 30:22.200
They go on and on and on
about nothing at all.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.854
It's crazy.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.275
He's in the union.

30:28.276 --> 30:29.258
Shit don't make no sense.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.994
What am I doing?
It's all good, right?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.262
Of course it's good.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.504
Of course this shit's good.
I know it's all here.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.048
I'll be right back.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.923
You know what else?

30:59.925 --> 31:02.025
Like, what's he thinking?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.928
The cops ain't
gonna fucking bust him
'cause he's banging hammers

31:04.930 --> 31:07.631
and pounding nails and fucking
running wires on the weekends?

31:07.633 --> 31:09.333
Fucking crazy.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.534
Like,
"Oh, I got a W-2, Officer.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.456
Please, leave me alone.
Don't arrest me."

31:14.974 --> 31:17.541
He got sent upstate
to Shirley for, I think,
two years or something.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.076
I haven't talked to him.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.982
It's crazy how you can be
best friends with someone

31:24.984 --> 31:27.424
and then five minutes later
you're fucking enemies. Right?

31:28.654 --> 31:29.920
It's crazy because...

31:33.125 --> 31:34.245
What the fuck, George?

31:38.464 --> 31:41.344
- Nicky, are you serious?
- Get down on the floor.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.335
Fuck, Nicky.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.603
You heard the man.
On the floor.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.765
Victor, you know I'll do it.
Get the fuck down.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.485
What are you doing?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.383
What the fuck, man?
Jesus Christ.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.084
I thought we were friends,
Georgie.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.286
I been setting this up
since I've known you.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.423
George, we met two years ago.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.692
Exactly.

32:08.694 --> 32:09.694
He's good, huh?

32:13.299 --> 32:14.932
Fuck!

32:14.934 --> 32:15.934
Fuck you!

32:21.073 --> 32:22.073
You fuckers!

32:34.019 --> 32:35.319
Cocksucker.

32:42.628 --> 32:43.748
It's fucking frozen.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.131
Guess I know
where he hides it.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.120
Hey, Nicky.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.162
When are you gonna take me out
and do something?

33:13.025 --> 33:14.358
How old are you?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.560
Hold on, Nicky.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.695
Melissa, I don't pay
you to talk. All right?

33:18.697 --> 33:20.697
Go get dressed.
We open in an hour.

33:22.735 --> 33:26.103
You hire relatives, that's
what you get. All they wanna
do is chit-chat.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.238
She's a good kid.
I'll see you.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.440
Whoa, Nicky.
Where are you going?
What's your rush?

33:30.442 --> 33:32.376
I got to go. I'm late for Sal.
I'll talk to you later.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.078
Sal and Jerry were
in here last night.
The place was packed.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.414
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed.
You're doing real
well for yourself.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.616
You're really expanding here.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.586
On that note, um, I hate
to bother you with this,

33:42.588 --> 33:44.621
but do you have
that grand you owe me?

33:44.623 --> 33:45.722
I'm sorry, Michael,
I don't have it.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.024
Things been pretty slow.
You know?

33:47.026 --> 33:48.458
Slow. Yeah, I hear you.

33:50.596 --> 33:54.364
You know, if you want,
I can get you
a job down at the deli

33:54.366 --> 33:56.133
or I can give you
a couple of hours
over here in the kitchen.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.667
You could pay me back,
work it off.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.069
Don't bust my balls,
all right?

33:59.071 --> 34:00.437
I ain't that guy.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.772
You ain't that guy?

34:01.774 --> 34:02.854
I ain't that guy.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.308
Which guy?

34:05.310 --> 34:07.344
The guy who doesn't pay?

34:07.346 --> 34:09.713
The guy who doesn't work?

34:09.715 --> 34:11.835
Or are you the guy
that wants to make trouble?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.418
Do me a favor, Nicky.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.085
Give me the money
when you have it, please?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.420
And say hi to Sal for me.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.722
You got it.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.723
- Thank you, Nick.
- Thank you.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.565
- All right.
- All right.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.500
Hey. Nicky, how are you?

34:32.838 --> 34:34.204
I'm here to see Sal.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.438
Oh, yeah.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.697
You got an address.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.554
Now, take care of it.

34:59.832 --> 35:02.799
You got to know,
there's a guy on that paper,

35:02.801 --> 35:05.235
ain't gonna show up
nowhere never again.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.738
<i>Capisce?</i>

35:17.282 --> 35:18.282
Yeah.

35:29.394 --> 35:32.514
Get this shifted.
Just move the boxes
onto the trolley there.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.798
All the boxes. Okay?

35:38.904 --> 35:40.137
Hey, Nicky.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.345
When you're young,
you got options.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.479
Later on, you don't.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.185
Enjoy the sunshine, Nicky.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.427
Be winter before you know it.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.378
What's going on
with my chatty
friend over there?

36:21.380 --> 36:22.620
I never heard you so quiet.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.476
You want some air
or something? You want me to
roll the window down?

36:53.478 --> 36:54.478
Yeah.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.754
You know,
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.405
We can go get
something to eat.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.652
The first one is hard.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.791
After that, it's...

38:00.979 --> 38:03.546
I'm just leaving
the office right now.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.468
I'll be home in
about a half an hour.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.550
I love you, too.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.815
Excuse me.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.115
Easy.

39:12.984 --> 39:13.984
Easy.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.038
Good to see you.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.461
- Sal.
- Nick.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.904
A big day for you.

40:40.906 --> 40:41.906
Yes, sir.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.246
Excuse me.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.880
In honor of the family,
the family is open.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.620
I, Niccolo Emilio Tortano...

41:34.626 --> 41:36.759
...want to enter
into this organization...

41:38.864 --> 41:40.024
...to protect
my family...

41:40.632 --> 41:41.798
...and to protect my friends.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.103
Our thing

41:47.105 --> 41:48.771
you wish to be a part of,

41:51.576 --> 41:54.696
it's a wonderful thing.
The greatest
thing in the world.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.118
Do you feel this way as well?

42:05.590 --> 42:08.258
Yes, I do.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.780
And wish to be a part of it
for the rest of your life?

42:11.930 --> 42:12.930
Yes.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.739
You agree
to be a soldier,

42:15.934 --> 42:18.034
follow the rules

42:18.036 --> 42:19.736
and obey our code of omerta

42:20.805 --> 42:22.605
until your dying breath?

42:22.607 --> 42:23.607
Yes.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.291
Jerry, will you be
Niccolo's <i> compare?</i>

42:30.949 --> 42:31.949
Proud of you.

42:49.901 --> 42:53.903
As this saint burns,
so will my soul burn.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.945
I live and die
by the gun and the knife.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.589
I swear never to betray
the secrets of this
thing that we have

43:02.314 --> 43:05.248
and to obey with
love and omerta

43:05.250 --> 43:07.183
the Sicilian code of silence.

43:11.990 --> 43:13.070
This family,

43:14.826 --> 43:16.259
we help each other

43:18.964 --> 43:22.265
because our people
became outlaws.

43:22.267 --> 43:26.603
What took place here today,
only the Ghost knows, by God.

43:32.811 --> 43:36.879
He who is blind,
deaf and mute
lives 100 years of happiness.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.953
Which finger do you use
to pull the trigger?

44:52.190 --> 44:53.723
<i>Mr. C.</i>

44:53.725 --> 44:54.725
Hey, Nicky.

44:55.460 --> 44:56.826
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

44:56.828 --> 44:57.960
Hey. My pleasure.

45:02.133 --> 45:03.433
Got those credit card numbers
we talked about?

45:03.435 --> 45:04.435
Yeah, yeah.

45:06.905 --> 45:09.405
Hey, I wanted to tell you,
it was a stroke of genius.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.240
Coming up with this idea.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.443
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.378
Mikey,
get him a drink, please.

45:19.984 --> 45:21.451
These numbers
ain't never been
run by you, right?

45:21.453 --> 45:24.454
No. That's the way
you wanted it, right?

45:24.456 --> 45:27.090
Yeah, that's the way I
wanted it, but you had these
over a month, right?

45:27.092 --> 45:29.759
Nicky,
I double-check 'em myself.

45:29.761 --> 45:32.095
If I say they're over a month,
you can go to bet on it.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.434
I'll see you next time.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.196
- Thank you, Mr. C.
- Okay.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.406
Nicky.

45:45.310 --> 45:46.375
Congratulations.

45:55.353 --> 45:56.473
Thank you.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.224
Don't forget,
you're in to Michael
for a grand, too, right?

46:01.226 --> 46:02.825
-Oh, that fucking prick.
-You owe a lot of
people money, man.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.293
-Fuck that cocksucker.
-You gotta chill
with that shit.

46:04.295 --> 46:06.175
I work in his
fucking deli, my ass.
What a bitch.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.965
So go get him.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.834
He knows everybody by name.
He knows everybody
in the neighborhood.

46:11.836 --> 46:14.504
He'll go crying to Sal
like a big fucking baby.

46:14.506 --> 46:16.506
So what? You're a made guy.
This guy's a fucking blowjob.

46:16.508 --> 46:17.628
What am I missing?

46:19.544 --> 46:20.544
Oh, yeah.

46:31.990 --> 46:35.150
Listen, no more free
ziti with meatballs
and Italian subs. All right?

46:36.795 --> 46:38.094
What's going on here?
What's the problem?

46:38.096 --> 46:39.176
What's the problem?

46:42.200 --> 46:45.401
The problem is you've opened
four of these stores
in the last three years.

46:45.403 --> 46:48.843
How much money can you really
be making selling fucking
mortadella and prosciutto?

46:52.143 --> 46:54.577
- Seriously? You're serious.
- What else are you doing?

46:54.579 --> 46:56.412
Why are you asking
all these questions?

46:56.414 --> 46:59.248
You're driving around
in a brand new Mercedes.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.890
You wouldn't fucking
lie to me, would you?

47:01.019 --> 47:03.252
I see.

47:03.254 --> 47:05.974
You got your button now.
You bring your baby gorilla
here to scare me?

47:07.826 --> 47:11.260
You know what? Why don't you
tell Jerry to give me a call.
We'll settle this, okay?

47:11.262 --> 47:14.530
Hey, wait. That's not...
That's not how it's gonna go.

47:14.532 --> 47:15.812
That's no way to talk to me.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.161
You're a gangster now?

47:25.376 --> 47:28.311
No disrespect,
Nick, but fuck you.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.946
I ain't paying you shit.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.628
Shh, shh, shh.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.353
All right?

47:39.023 --> 47:41.103
How many accounts
receivable you got?

47:42.193 --> 47:44.273
How many people
haven't paid you?

47:46.364 --> 47:48.264
- You're asking me this?
- I'm asking you.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.199
Ten, 20, too many.

47:52.871 --> 47:54.751
Stand up.
Come on, get up.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.075
Stand up.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.244
Listen to me. All right?

48:01.246 --> 48:03.512
Listen to what this is.

48:03.514 --> 48:06.616
I take care of you.
You take care of me.

48:06.618 --> 48:09.452
Anybody who don't
take care of you
is also not taking care of me.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.187
I gave
your brother Vito a job
when he was a little kid.

48:11.189 --> 48:13.189
And now it's
time to repay the favor.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.925
Yeah, let's go take
a look at your books.

48:15.927 --> 48:18.167
I'm gonna take care of
everything, all right?

48:21.599 --> 48:22.999
What are you
fucking busting my balls for?

48:23.001 --> 48:25.635
It's 32 grand in there.

48:25.637 --> 48:28.137
I got 12 coming in
from Freddy Charles
in Lynn.

48:28.139 --> 48:30.072
Also, you know, Tony's running
them Slavic girls on the side.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.508
Don't worry about Tony.

48:32.510 --> 48:35.070
Don't worry about Tony.
And don't worry about
his daughter either.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.248
Call isuckcock.com
if you get lonely.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.770
No, you can't call them.
The Feds know about that, too.

48:41.986 --> 48:43.552
What?

48:43.554 --> 48:45.688
- Suckcock.com?
- Yeah.

49:05.343 --> 49:06.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:12.684 --> 49:14.050
What the fuck do you want?

49:22.293 --> 49:23.293
We, uh...

49:24.996 --> 49:28.197
We heard you been
running Ukrainian girls
out of here.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.639
Pimping them out
to high-end clients.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.636
Yeah?

49:33.638 --> 49:37.006
You better start feeding
your rat some better
fucking cheese. All right?

49:37.008 --> 49:39.208
'Cause there ain't no
Ukrainian broads here.

49:39.677 --> 49:41.344
These are local girls.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.411
- Hmm?
- Oh, yeah.

49:42.747 --> 49:43.747
Mmm-hmm.

49:45.483 --> 49:46.763
Where're you from, sweetheart?

49:49.354 --> 49:50.486
Rhode Island.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.759
We know from
a certain hotel off Boylston

49:56.761 --> 50:00.081
these girls are making
$1,000 a night
outside the club.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.325
Can you
believe this motherfucker?

50:06.304 --> 50:07.987
Look, kid.

50:07.988 --> 50:09.671
Tony ain't
gotta give you shit.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.541
All right?
Just 'cause you're made,
that don't mean nothing to us.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.176
- Really?
- Yeah, especially me.

50:14.178 --> 50:15.211
Really.

50:16.714 --> 50:18.714
Tell Tony we
just want our cut.

50:19.550 --> 50:20.630
It's that simple.

50:38.636 --> 50:39.636
Hey.

50:43.708 --> 50:46.308
Flowers again, huh?
What do you want?

50:48.212 --> 50:50.279
It's next time.
Better flowers.

50:52.150 --> 50:53.150
Thank you.

50:55.186 --> 50:56.706
What...
What are you doing now?

50:59.290 --> 51:00.290
Going home.

51:01.459 --> 51:02.579
I could walk with you.

51:05.797 --> 51:09.331
I'm okay. I can walk myself.
It's just a few blocks away.

51:09.333 --> 51:12.773
I can walk with you.
My car's in the shop,
but I like to walk.

51:20.178 --> 51:21.178
It's a Cadillac.

51:23.147 --> 51:25.614
- What?
- My car. It's a Cadillac.

51:25.616 --> 51:27.850
Three hundred horsepower.
Leather seats.

51:27.851 --> 51:30.085
It's a real comfortable ride.
I could give you
a lift home sometime.

51:30.088 --> 51:32.221
Yeah. Sure. Leather seats.

51:34.292 --> 51:35.624
What, you don't like
leather seats?

51:35.626 --> 51:37.506
What's wrong
with leather seats?

51:42.800 --> 51:44.600
"You don't like leather seats?

51:45.369 --> 51:47.870
"Who don't like leather seats?
Leather seats."

51:47.872 --> 51:50.473
- That's how I sound?
I sound like that?

51:50.475 --> 51:52.708
That's the way I sound to you?

51:52.710 --> 51:54.343
You know what?
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

51:54.345 --> 51:55.778
I'm not gonna say nothing else
the whole walk home.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.379
Oh, yeah. I bet.

52:09.293 --> 52:10.293
Okay, then.

52:14.565 --> 52:15.685
You may speak now.

52:23.708 --> 52:24.807
Okay.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.544
Vow of silence still?

52:30.548 --> 52:31.548
Okay.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.317
Okay.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.186
Good night.

52:37.188 --> 52:39.221
You wop greaser.

52:39.223 --> 52:40.689
Good night, you stupid guinea.

52:43.294 --> 52:44.374
Open your yapper.

52:47.932 --> 52:48.932
Okay.

53:01.245 --> 53:03.485
You just gonna keep
bringing me flowers, huh?

53:04.582 --> 53:05.862
Are we gonna go to the prom?

53:08.619 --> 53:09.619
Oh.

53:11.322 --> 53:12.521
I see. Ahem!

53:14.458 --> 53:15.698
You're embarrassing yourself.

53:20.498 --> 53:21.764
Come on, say something.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.534
Tell me...

53:25.536 --> 53:28.504
Tell me some more about
your horsepower
and your gold chains

53:28.506 --> 53:30.606
and your Virgin Mary.
Tell me...

53:30.608 --> 53:32.928
Tell me how much you love
your I-talian mother.

54:19.490 --> 54:20.730
I'm a woman you can love.

54:22.793 --> 54:23.793
Be careful.

54:58.663 --> 55:00.663
<i>And you</i>
<i>couldn't see this coming</i>
<i>a mile away?</i>

55:00.665 --> 55:02.598
It's a setup.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.667
Look at the patterns
he was rifling in.

55:04.669 --> 55:08.971
Nickel A and R.
Dime, dime, dime, dime tease.

55:08.973 --> 55:12.675
Nickel A and R.
Maxes out every bet.
Bets every game.

55:12.677 --> 55:15.477
One day,
hockey and basketball,
the next day football.

55:16.414 --> 55:17.946
Come on!

55:17.948 --> 55:19.668
He takes
the favorite in every game.

55:24.922 --> 55:26.855
We pay this guy for
the past three weeks?

55:26.857 --> 55:27.956
- Yeah.
- How much?

55:27.958 --> 55:29.591
- 10,000.
- 10,000!

55:31.796 --> 55:34.830
And he's down now, what?
25,000?

55:34.832 --> 55:36.031
And you didn't cut him off?

55:36.033 --> 55:37.533
I thought he was good for it.

55:37.535 --> 55:38.535
Okay.

55:38.936 --> 55:40.069
Mmm-hmm.

55:40.071 --> 55:42.371
Who is this guy?

55:42.373 --> 55:44.506
All I have is a phone number.

55:44.508 --> 55:46.608
You're letting
people take action,

55:46.610 --> 55:48.477
and you don't even
know their faces,
you fucking moron?

55:48.479 --> 55:51.113
What the fuck are you
doing about it, Joe?

55:51.115 --> 55:52.948
What am I supposed
to do about it, huh?

55:52.950 --> 55:54.950
If I knew who the guy
was or where he was,

55:54.952 --> 55:56.385
- I'd break his fucking legs.
Mmm-hmm.

55:56.387 --> 55:58.587
I call him. He says
he ain't got the money.

55:58.589 --> 56:00.756
And he fucking hangs up, Tony.
What do you want me to do?

56:00.758 --> 56:02.358
- It's this
fucking punk's fault.
Joe...

56:02.360 --> 56:03.680
Get him
the fuck out of here!

56:03.894 --> 56:05.928
We have no idea
who this guy is.

56:07.064 --> 56:08.497
Why not?

56:08.499 --> 56:09.998
All I got is a number.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.867
What do you mean,
you just have a phone number?

56:11.869 --> 56:13.535
You're the fucking agent!

56:16.707 --> 56:19.108
This is a fucking setup
and you're all in on it.

56:20.978 --> 56:22.378
Jesus. Fuck!

56:23.948 --> 56:26.188
I'll do it myself.
What's the number?

56:29.153 --> 56:30.913
Come on,
give him the fucking number.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.069
What are you doing?

56:34.558 --> 56:37.659
I just texted it to you.

56:37.661 --> 56:41.029
Why don't you
just fucking tell me
the fucking number?

56:42.700 --> 56:44.133
Jesus! Fuck!

56:46.871 --> 56:48.791
Get out there.
Waste more of my time.

56:49.707 --> 56:51.607
Come on.

56:51.609 --> 56:54.510
Come on.
Come on, you fucking moron.
Get out of here.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.044
What are you,
a fucking dickhead?

56:56.046 --> 56:57.446
You trying to get me
in fucking trouble?

56:57.448 --> 56:58.614
Seriously?

57:01.552 --> 57:02.552
Hey.

57:03.154 --> 57:04.154
Hey.

57:07.491 --> 57:09.191
Go make a buck.

57:09.193 --> 57:12.233
What do you think,
this is a dumb slut
convention?

57:15.499 --> 57:17.019
My God!
You two are depressing.

57:27.812 --> 57:30.846
Is this F-4?

57:30.848 --> 57:32.781
Come on, man,
don't be such
a fucking jerkoff.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.717
You owe me 25,000.
It's been three weeks.

57:35.719 --> 57:38.754
I'm gonna beat you.
I'm gonna fucking
rape you in a body bag.

57:42.493 --> 57:45.894
Oh. Oh...

57:45.896 --> 57:49.865
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had no idea your life
was so fucking hard.

57:51.669 --> 57:52.669
Yeah.

57:54.572 --> 57:56.932
Yeah. I know the place.
Do you got my fucking money?

57:59.076 --> 58:01.877
Okay. I'll meet you there now.

58:01.879 --> 58:03.545
Fuck you, by the way.

58:05.749 --> 58:07.182
Hey.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.884
Hey. Hey.

58:08.886 --> 58:11.019
Joy Luck Club,

58:11.021 --> 58:13.421
go shake your rice cakes,
I got bills to fucking pay.

58:15.192 --> 58:17.226
Yeah, don't think
I didn't see that.

58:17.228 --> 58:19.661
I see everything!

58:25.669 --> 58:26.669
Hey.

58:29.039 --> 58:30.039
Nice hat.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.710
Yeah? You like it?

58:36.514 --> 58:37.779
I do, I do. I like the hat.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.248
Thanks. Just got it.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.086
So, what do you want to do?

58:44.088 --> 58:46.768
You want to go to
the movies or something?
It's freezing.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.306
How do you know my father?

58:56.233 --> 58:57.233
What?

58:58.269 --> 58:59.801
I don't talk to him.

59:02.306 --> 59:03.872
He's an asshole.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.040
Nick.

59:05.042 --> 59:10.112
I stay away from him
and the people he
hangs out with. So...

59:16.620 --> 59:17.386
Really?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.227
'Cause he seems
like such a sweetheart.

59:24.662 --> 59:25.662
Look.

59:28.866 --> 59:29.998
I like you. All right?

59:43.080 --> 59:44.360
I didn't like you at all.

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:38.795
Hey.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:50.473
Hey.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.171
- See you.
- Bye.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.404
Vito!

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:11.254
Hey.

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:27.656
You know, you don't
got to smoke out here.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.026
Mom ain't here to
tell you any different.

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:45.387
Are you gonna say hello to me?

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.999
"Hey, Nick.
How are you, Nick?"

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.574
If you're not
gonna talk to me,

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.605
give this to Vito
for me, will you?

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.201
You're a big shot now.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.453
Big tough guy, huh?

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.623
Excuse me?

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:22.865
What do you got?

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:24.993
What do you got here?

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.464
Wow, look at that.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:33.950
Throwing it around.

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.472
Hey, who wants a hundie?

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.941
There's a 50
right there for you.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.443
Take a 20, huh? Big shot.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:49.417
Smells like blood to me.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.452
It's college money.

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:51.519
It stinks.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.458
You haven't had
a job since Mom died.

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:09.437
Take the money.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.543
If she knew what
you were doing...

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:18.625
If your mother knew
what you were up to,
she'd be sick.

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:22.050
You'd kill her all over again.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:35.497
There's 2 grand right here.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.065
Get it out of my sight.

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:40.502
I think Vito could use it.
Don't you?

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:41.624
Over my dead body.

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:47.075
I'm begging you.

01:05:50.314 --> 01:05:52.234
What do I got to
say to you, huh?

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:55.617
What do I got to do?

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.674
What do I got to do
to get through to you?

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.626
My boy. Beautiful boy.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:15.971
If your mother
were alive, she'd say,
<i>"Tu aviadu morde."</i>

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.084
You say that to me?

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:33.235
I'm your son, Pa!

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:36.224
I have a son.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.569
Get that out of my house.

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.553
<i>Jesus Christ, George.
What the fuck?</i>

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.523
<i>I missed, like, nine calls
from you last night.</i>

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.760
<i>I stayed over at
Tony's daughter's house.</i>

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:14.529
<i>Sal's gonna be pissed,</i>
<i>so keep your fucking mouth</i>
<i>shut about it, all right?</i>

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.699
<i>Anyway, I got your message</i>
<i>with some fucking</i>
<i>address up in Lynn.</i>

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.821
<i>I guess I'll be there
in, like, an hour.</i>

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.100
Fuck! Tony.

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:27.669
Hey! Look who it is.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.537
Merry fucking Christmas.

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:34.742
Look at this guy, huh?

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.703
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:38.613
He got fucked up.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.417
What the fuck
did you do, George?

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:44.285
I couldn't
avoid this here.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.688
- What the fuck?
- A bit complicated.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.723
What the fuck?
- He looks fucked up,
doesn't he?

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.131
It's fucked up
how it happened.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:57.372
You want to hear the story?

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.673
I was rifling
into this big book

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.635
that a friend of mine
had put me on with
a few weeks back.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:13.765
I think I told you about it.

01:09:13.765 --> 01:09:15.249
Anyways, must have
been beginner's luck.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:18.219
Because right out
of the fucking gate,
I'm hitting everything.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.687
I won 10 grand.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.290
First couple of weeks.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:27.162
But what do I
know about football?

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.430
I don't know
shit about football.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:32.267
Eventually,
I started missing some bets.

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:34.709
Actually, the third week,
I fucking missed everything.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.372
I mean, I got fucking buried.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.576
I was losing
everything I put in.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.344
Went down 25,000.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.917
So I tried to be scarce.

01:09:48.919 --> 01:09:50.585
Fall off the radar a minute.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.220
I tried to avoid these pricks.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.756
Honest to God, I did. I did.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.230
But they kept

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:03.731
calling

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:06.568
and harassing

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:08.937
and calling

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.339
and harassing my friend,

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.842
until eventually he caved in.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:18.313
He coughs up my phone number.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:21.715
So, yesterday I'm sitting
at the house, I'm waiting
for this broad to call me up,

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.320
and I see
a number I don't know.

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:26.521
I think it must be her.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.791
And I pick up the phone.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.878
You know whose voice
I hear on the other line?

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:44.546
My handsome friend,
right here.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:47.649
I mean,
what are the fucking chances?

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.280
It was fucking unbelievable.
I couldn't believe it.
I mean...

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.282
We just saw this prick
a few weeks ago.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:57.599
Fucked me all up.

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:01.889
Of course, right away,
he starts with the tough talk.

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:04.659
The beatings and
the body bags and the...

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:09.797
Real fucking wise prick.

01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:12.967
I mean, this is one
disrespectful fuck!

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:21.476
I gave him a bullshit story.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:23.544
I told him
I have half his money.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:25.586
"I got half of
your money, Tony.

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.315
"I got half."

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.627
Comes into my neighborhood.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:36.557
And once he got
out of his car,

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.760
I fucking tased him.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.642
Threw him in
the back of my car.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.520
Well, I think you can
deduce the rest of
the story from there.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.340
You set him up?

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.609
What are you? Fucking stupid?

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:55.877
You're gonna get
us both killed.
You got to let him go.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:56.944
I don't got to do shit!

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:57.946
George.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.816
I didn't even
know it was his book

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.085
until I heard his
fucking retarded voice
on my phone.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:10.163
I do know one thing, though.
See, to me, you know
what this seems like?

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.761
It seems like fate.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.103
I mean, Nick,
I think they call it kismet.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.905
Fucking stop, George!

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.374
Oh, shit!

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.818
Hey! Hey! Hey! Jerry!

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:40.421
Jerry. What's up, huh?

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:42.583
You don't return
our fucking calls?

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:44.873
You can't leave a voicemail?

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.962
Cut the shit, man.
Tony's missing.

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:50.798
Yeah, he don't
return our calls either.
That's not like him.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.467
Something's up.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.001
You know where he is?

01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.471
What do I look like,
the fucking lost and found?

01:12:56.473 --> 01:12:58.473
Hey, you don't want me
to tell you what you
look like. All right?

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.475
You better not know
where my fucking boss is.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:03.711
I know what I'd like
to do to your boss.
But we got money on him.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.547
Whoa. Wait a minute. We?
What do you mean, "we"?

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:10.051
All I see
is one guy standing in
a fucking empty loading dock.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:12.587
There ain't no more "we."
Okay? It's us.

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:14.689
All right? From here on out.

01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:16.824
Don't think I don't know
what the fuck's
going on around here.

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:19.107
Hey. You know why they call me
"daylight," right? Hmm?

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:20.962
You wanna find out?

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:25.800
Hey, get out of here,
you fucking project trash.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:26.802
Fuck you!

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:41.149
Uh...

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:43.851
I didn't mean
for this to happen.
I'm sorry. All right?

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.453
You got to believe me.
I'm sorry.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:47.455
They're fucking
with Sal's business.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.690
You got no idea
what you're into.

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:57.665
You're in so far
over your head.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.100
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:04.539
That mark, got you made,

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.209
he was on the up.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.445
He was just in our way.

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:16.984
You clueless... Fuck!

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:22.557
You don't talk to me
like that. All right?

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:24.225
I'm a fucking made guy.

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.693
You might be protected,
but Sal made me, all right?

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:26.828
So shut your fucking mouth.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.729
Mr. Made Guy.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:35.736
You got no idea
the wrath Sal's
gonna bring down.

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:37.418
Fuck this greaseball, Nick.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:44.879
Fuck this greaseball fuck.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:46.681
Untie him, George.
We're letting him go.

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.683
What?

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:51.786
I said untie
the motherfucker, now.

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:55.971
I ain't fucking untying him.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:59.193
What's done is done.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:01.562
What do you think is going
to happen when Sal sees him
like this anyways?

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:02.697
Let him go, George.

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:10.124
Can't send him
back to Sal like that.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.006
Look at him.

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.304
- Hey, listen.
- Fuck.

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.481
You're gonna die
out here, you fuck.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.682
George.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.618
You're gonna die ugly.

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.755
You're gonna die, you fuck.
You hear me?

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:28.997
You're gonna fucking die.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
George!

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.031
George!

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.533
I said let him go now!

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:44.539
Oh, yeah?

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.141
Yeah.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:50.846
Yeah.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.779
- That's how it's gonna be?
- That's how it's gonna be.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.156
That's right, Nick. Shoot him.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.158
Shut up!

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:07.662
Kill him, Nick. Shoot him.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:10.846
Go ahead, shoot me.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:14.168
Kill him.
Go on. Shoot him, Nick.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.719
Let me tell you
something, Tony.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:23.177
Nick here, he ain't a shooter.
It ain't in his DNA.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:25.112
Don't you fucking
test me, George.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:28.749
Yeah,
Sal was gonna kill this fuck
no matter what.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:30.851
Huh?

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:32.693
Save yourself, Nick.
Shoot him.

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:35.222
Shoot him. Come on, kill him.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:36.464
Go ahead, shoot me, Nick.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:42.930
Hey, did you tell Tony
about you and his daughter?

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.033
- George. Shut your mouth.
- Oh!

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.168
- George.
- Oh, you didn't know?

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.903
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:50.145
Oh, he didn't know.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.342
- This is beautiful.
It's fucking beautiful.
Shut up.

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:56.811
- Yeah. Hey, Tony.
- Shut up.

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.613
- Guess who's
fucking your daughter?
Fuck you, George.

01:17:00.817 --> 01:17:01.817
Yeah?

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:03.851
Yeah.

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:04.853
That apology,

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.790
- it went real well.
- Kill him.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.965
She accepted it,
I think. Yeah.

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:12.694
- Shoot him.
- Shut up!

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:14.729
Do it!

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:17.365
- He's fucking piping her.
- I swear to God, George!

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:19.367
- Fucking do him.
Shoot. Dead already.
Shut up!

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:21.102
- Shut up!
- Kill him!

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:23.070
- Why don't you tell
Mr. Matazano...
Kill him.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.872
- ...how you got made?
- Nick.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.777
Why don't you tell him
how you got made?

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:32.046
You know how he got made?
Who do you think
made that hit for him?

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:33.808
- George.
- Who did it for him?

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:37.952
I fucking did
that hit for him.

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:45.271
He was too afraid
to pull the trigger.
It's not in him.

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:49.930
I fucking made you!

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:51.833
I made you!

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:54.669
Shoot him, Nick.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:58.773
Kill him, Nick. Do it.

01:17:58.775 --> 01:18:00.908
You don't have
it in your heart.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.845
Shoot him.
Kill him. Shoot him!

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.681
You know what?
Maybe we should untie him.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.449
- Nick. Nick.
- Maybe we should untie him.

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.851
'Cause I want Sal
and everybody else
to know...

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.053
- What?
- ...exactly who you are.

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:14.021
- Nicky.
- What?

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:17.958
Look, my daughter...
I could give a fuck, man.
Okay?

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.928
Your secret, don't worry.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.330
- Your secret's safe with me.
- You ain't a shooter.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.366
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Shut your mouth.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:26.901
-Shoot him.
-You don't have
the fucking heart to do it.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.463
- Shoot me! Go ahead.
- Nick, shoot him.

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.104
Come on, please.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.405
You ain't a shooter.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:33.140
- Shoot him. Nick.
- You're not a shooter.

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.942
Do it! Yeah, shoot him.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.111
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shoot him. Shoot him.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:52.026
That's the fucking spirit!

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.508
I knew you had it in you.
I knew you had it in you.

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:11.278
How's that feel?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.253
Where are you going?

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:21.615
Hey, where are you going?
This is your mess to clean up.

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:25.960
I brought
the fucking contracting bags.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.309
It was that kid
from Dorchester.
Nick's boy. Georgie Mullins.

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:14.341
You sure that's the guy
that owed Tony the 25?

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.983
Yeah. We finally found
that agent. The one that's
running the books.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.113
He said it was Mullins.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:21.115
Tony went to go talk to him,

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.477
and that's the last
time I heard from him.
I mean, add it up.

01:20:24.086 --> 01:20:25.206
Nick don't answer.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.355
Look, we've been looking
for Tony everywhere.

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:30.057
I know those two motherfuckers
know something.

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:31.179
I'll look into it.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.155
Look, Sal.
We've been good to you.
You know?

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:38.132
I'll decide whether
you've been good to me.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:39.774
I told you I'll look into it.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.875
- Tried his cell.
- Let's go find this prick.

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:50.597
Tried his cell phone,
house phone.
Even called his father.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.249
Yeah?

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:58.299
Nicky, where the fuck
have you been?

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:04.291
I've been...

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:06.413
I've been busy.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.316
Where are you right now?

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.634
What?

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:19.306
Sal's looking for you, Nicky.
We need to see you now.

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:21.442
<i>Tony's missing
and they got wind</i>

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:24.205
<i>that crazy mick of yours</i>
<i>was the last one</i>
<i>that seen him.</i>

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:29.529
They've gone over
to your folks' house,
looking for you.

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:34.021
<i>Nicky,
do the right thing here.</i>

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:26.441
Nick here?

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:31.245
No. Nick don't live here.
Who are you?

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:34.487
You his brother?
Look, Nick's in deep shit.
Where the fuck is he?

01:22:39.322 --> 01:22:41.355
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?
Come back later.

01:22:41.357 --> 01:22:44.258
What? Hey! Hey, hey.
Don't fucking
close the door on me.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.026
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:47.628
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I got this. Dad, I got this.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:49.330
- Just calm down.
- Get in the house. Please.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:50.982
-Come on,
what are you gonna do?
-Get in the house.

01:22:50.983 --> 01:22:52.633
- You got a problem here?
- Yeah. Fuck you! Look...

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.202
This is private property.

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:55.770
- Get the hell out of here.
- I don't give a fuck.

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:57.338
You tell your brother
Joe came by.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.207
Okay? And I'm gonna find him,
so you might as well
tell me where he is.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:01.575
We wouldn't tell
you where he was
even if we knew. Let's go.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:03.477
Come on. Get... Get off...

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:05.112
-Get off my...
-Don't put your
fucking hands on me.

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:06.046
This is
private property.

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:07.548
Get your fucking
hands off me.

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:09.249
Don't put your
fucking hands on me.

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.385
- Fuck you!
- This is private property.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:12.186
What are you gonna do?
You got a fucking problem?

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:13.754
Get out of here!

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:16.490
Don't put your
fucking hands on me again,
old man. You hear me?

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:19.059
Listen, your son's
a fucking punk, all right?

01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:20.761
He did the wrong thing
to the wrong fucking people.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.763
You're a punk.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.685
I'm a punk?
He's gonna pay
the fucking price.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:27.735
Vito, no!

01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:29.303
Hey, Vito!

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:30.437
Get back!

01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:33.040
Vito! Get out of here!

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:35.376
Go home, guys! Vito!

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:37.011
- Get the fuck off me!
- Just go home!

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.746
You want to fuck with me?
Here you go!

01:23:38.748 --> 01:23:40.147
- Motherfucker!
- Vito!

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:41.149
- No!
- Come on!

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.186
Dad?

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:48.422
Come on. Let's go.

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:51.225
Come on. Come on.
Come on! Get in the car!

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:52.507
Let's go! Tom, get in the car!

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.195
What the fuck?

01:24:03.072 --> 01:24:05.272
My brother's gonna
fucking kill you!

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.410
- You're okay.
Come on. You're okay.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:15.650
Please, Pop.

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:23.190
Can you hear me, Pop?
Can you hear me?

01:24:23.192 --> 01:24:25.473
Can you hear me, Pop?
Can you hear me?

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:30.664
Get him in the car.
Help me get him
in the fucking car.

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.826
-Help me get him
in the fucking car!
-Nicky, Nicky. Nick. Nick.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.399
Fuck!

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:07.168
Fuck!

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:18.265
I gotta talk to Sal.
Where is he?

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:21.696
He ain't gonna see you, Nicky.

01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:26.420
Don't fuck with me, Jerry.
Where are they?

01:25:26.422 --> 01:25:28.655
I'm gonna fucking kill him!
That Joe is
a fucking dead man.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:31.391
No, no. You're not.
We're gonna take
care of things now.

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:33.153
You need to
fucking relax, Nicky.

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:39.674
They killed my father, Jerry.

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:45.259
I'm sorry, Nicky.
Things are a mess right now.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:48.208
They found Tony up in Lynn.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.346
In a fucking bag.

01:25:58.921 --> 01:26:00.921
And that guy in
the parking garage.

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:04.725
He was straight,
though, wasn't he?

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:07.628
He got in the way.
People get in the way.

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.329
In the way.
In the way of what?

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:12.251
Doesn't matter.
You didn't kill him,
did you, Nick?

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:21.608
I told Sal to bring you in.
I put myself on
the line for you.

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.577
Your own father didn't care
if you was alive or dead.

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:25.712
- It's not fucking true.
- Here's what's true!

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.548
Get out of town.
Forget this girl.

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.883
Forget Sal. Forget this.

01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:32.405
-Forget this,
this thing we have.
-Jerry.

01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:41.396
Jerry.

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.470
Look...

01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:25.906
Hey, man, I'm so sorry.

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:28.408
Look.
This is what we gonna do.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.930
We find them all one by one
and then murder those fucks.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:35.002
No reaction to that?

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:37.618
What's the matter?

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.919
- No emotion?
- Shut up, George.

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:40.401
Nick, they killed
your fucking father.

01:27:40.723 --> 01:27:42.403
I said shut
the fuck up, all right?

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:48.734
You having second thoughts
about what needs
to be done here?

01:27:53.035 --> 01:27:54.035
Why?

01:27:56.038 --> 01:27:58.305
Is it because you're
banging that whore?

01:27:58.307 --> 01:27:59.587
That clown's fucking daughter?

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:11.785
Or is it because your boss,
Sally Jane Fungulo,
might get mad?

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:12.907
You're afraid of that?

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:16.137
Nick, we had to kill Tony.

01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:20.214
How many times
did he disrespect you?

01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:26.641
Disrespected your friend?

01:28:29.705 --> 01:28:31.471
You listen to me.

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:33.373
What happened the other night
never happened, all right?

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:35.509
I know you, George.
You got a big fucking mouth.

01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:37.377
A few weeks go by.
You get 10 deep in some bar.

01:28:37.379 --> 01:28:38.345
And suddenly
everyone in Southie

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.706
gets the idea
that what never happened,
happened.

01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:43.884
Who are you talking to?

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.006
You talking to me?

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:48.488
I run my fucking mouth?

01:28:50.893 --> 01:28:52.173
You're an ungrateful fuck.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:58.203
It wasn't enough
that I saved your fucking
pretty ass in Shirley?

01:28:58.534 --> 01:28:59.654
That's not enough?

01:29:02.404 --> 01:29:05.038
It ain't enough that I'm
fucking cutting you in
on all my action

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.400
just so you can kick it back
to these filthy
fucking guineas?

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:08.676
It ain't enough?

01:29:11.447 --> 01:29:13.647
It ain't enough that I
gotta drive you around

01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:15.569
to suck all
the dicks you gotta suck?

01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:21.794
Guys like Joe?
That's what bullets
were invented for.

01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:23.671
Kill that fucker.

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:26.574
You gotta kill him.

01:29:34.737 --> 01:29:37.404
You ain't like me.

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:39.446
You ain't nothing like me.
You're a fucking wannabe.

01:29:39.508 --> 01:29:41.742
A fucking wannabe.

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:44.184
Talking about all that
"restoring order to
the North End" shit.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.180
You never had it in you.
You're a fucking poser.

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:48.936
You never had it in you!

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:54.969
You're a fucking fraud.

01:29:56.091 --> 01:29:57.457
You shut your mouth.

01:29:57.459 --> 01:29:58.825
Everything you say is a lie.

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:00.460
Everything you think
is a fucking delusion.

01:30:00.462 --> 01:30:01.695
You shut your fucking mouth.

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:03.029
Everything you believe
is a fucking delusion.

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:05.799
I said shut
your fucking mouth!
You hear me?

01:30:05.801 --> 01:30:07.801
You know who knew
you were a fraud
more than anyone?

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:09.803
Your old man.

01:30:16.412 --> 01:30:17.677
Nice fucking friend I have.

01:30:19.982 --> 01:30:22.422
Nice fucking friend I have.
You know who your friends are?

01:30:22.484 --> 01:30:24.551
Big fucking mafioso man!

01:30:24.553 --> 01:30:26.486
Look at you.
You're a made man now.

01:30:26.488 --> 01:30:28.021
You're a made man!

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.689
Where are your friends now?

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:31.591
Where are your friends now?

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:33.593
Where are your
fucking friends now?

01:30:33.796 --> 01:30:35.636
I can count
mine on one finger!

01:31:22.878 --> 01:31:23.878
Hey.

01:31:25.247 --> 01:31:26.780
I've been calling you.

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:30.817
Can I come in?

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:33.434
I have to go to work soon.

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:49.170
You all right?

01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:53.608
Yeah.

01:31:54.142 --> 01:31:55.142
Yeah.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:00.453
Listen, some guys came around
asking where my father is.

01:32:05.153 --> 01:32:06.153
Oh, yeah?

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:12.860
Yeah.

01:32:18.567 --> 01:32:20.447
Do you know
anything about that?

01:32:33.282 --> 01:32:35.762
- I have to go
away for a while.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:39.553
What do you need?

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.960
Do you know
where my father is?

01:32:53.702 --> 01:32:55.602
Nick.

01:32:55.604 --> 01:32:56.884
Would you go away with me?

01:33:00.676 --> 01:33:01.676
Nick.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:10.784
Would you?

01:33:15.657 --> 01:33:16.777
Where's my father?

01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:42.283
Fuck you!

01:33:43.819 --> 01:33:45.699
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

01:33:52.628 --> 01:33:53.748
Why did you do that?

01:33:56.665 --> 01:33:57.945
Why did you do that?

01:33:58.734 --> 01:34:00.800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:01.802
I'm sorry.

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:04.404
I'm so sorry.

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:22.322
He's with the girl?

01:34:37.673 --> 01:34:38.705
Get rid of him.

01:38:25.533 --> 01:38:26.613
What are you doing?

01:38:33.642 --> 01:38:34.922
I'm dropping this off for you.

01:38:36.945 --> 01:38:37.945
That's for you.

01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:44.651
Where you going?

01:38:50.025 --> 01:38:51.905
I gotta take
care of some stuff.

01:39:04.506 --> 01:39:05.586
Let me go with you.

01:39:14.249 --> 01:39:15.315
That's for you.

01:39:24.492 --> 01:39:25.492
Hey!

01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:41.041
Fuck you.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.539
Don't fucking follow me.

01:41:23.545 --> 01:41:24.545
Move over.

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.360
Let's take a drive.

01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:45.778
I'm not surprised
to see you, Niccolo.

01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:07.581
It's done.

01:43:10.585 --> 01:43:11.585
This thing

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:13.687
that you have.

01:43:14.656 --> 01:43:15.656
This

01:43:17.358 --> 01:43:18.358
family.

01:43:22.497 --> 01:43:23.696
It's all I ever wanted.

01:43:26.968 --> 01:43:28.401
But it's done.

01:43:32.407 --> 01:43:33.673
Why don't you put that down?

01:43:33.675 --> 01:43:36.876
You destroyed
everything I ever cared about.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.680
And now, I'm going
to fucking kill you.

01:43:49.824 --> 01:43:51.624
What the fuck have you done?

01:43:53.394 --> 01:43:54.474
What have I done?

01:43:56.364 --> 01:43:57.644
I've done what I needed to do.

01:43:58.633 --> 01:44:01.434
Yeah?

01:44:01.436 --> 01:44:04.836
You let those guys
go over to my house.
My fucking house.

01:44:06.241 --> 01:44:08.708
Killed my father. My girl.

01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:10.710
Your father didn't care
if you was alive or dead.

01:44:10.712 --> 01:44:12.832
You might as well
have been an orphan.

01:44:14.682 --> 01:44:16.842
I gave you something
and you threw it away.

01:44:19.554 --> 01:44:21.721
You do all that,
start killing people
in cold blood

01:44:21.723 --> 01:44:23.489
so he finally approves of you?

01:44:23.491 --> 01:44:25.731
Like he's looking down
from heaven all proud?

01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:30.696
Let me tell you something. Oh.

01:44:32.667 --> 01:44:34.948
He ain't looking down
on you from nowhere.

01:44:48.549 --> 01:44:50.669
You're gonna have to
kill all of us, Nick.

01:44:53.054 --> 01:44:54.353
There ain't many left.

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:56.696
But there's enough for you.

01:45:02.964 --> 01:45:04.804
Let me ask you
a question, Sal.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.960
You ever been in love?

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:17.710
Of course.

01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:19.945
Who hasn't been in love?

01:45:49.577 --> 01:45:51.477
Sal. I need a pick-up.

01:46:25.813 --> 01:46:27.046
Need a lighter.
