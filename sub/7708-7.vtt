WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.737
Uh-huh.

00:04.739 --> 00:07.239
Well, I know that, Neal,
but it's important

00:07.241 --> 00:09.508
now that you-you move on.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.977
Get off the phone.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.445
I understand that too

00:13.447 --> 00:15.881
but y-you shouldn't just sit
around being depressed.

00:15.883 --> 00:19.084
Tell him life's a drag,
then you die.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.553
Now, get off the phone.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.757
Will you let go of my pants?

00:24.759 --> 00:29.061
Oh, I was talking to...Kate.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.197
Ah, she said hi.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.234
Of course. Any time
you wanna talk, I'm here.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.237
Ah, that's what
brothers are for.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.571
Uncle Neal again?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.708
Who else?
The guy's a royal pain in the--

00:42.710 --> 00:44.743
ALF.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.646
I'm sick of this guy
calling all the time.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.482
He's like hemorrhoids
with a dialing finger.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.752
Have a little compassion, ALF.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.889
Uncle Neal is going through
a really rough time right now.

00:56.891 --> 01:00.559
I know, I know.
His wife left him.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.663
What I can't figure out
is why it took her so long.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.833
Neal, gotta stop
doing this to yourself.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.935
It's time
you took charge of things.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.003
Don't you see?

01:11.005 --> 01:14.173
You have to grab life
by the lapels

01:14.175 --> 01:17.676
and shake your spirit free.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.812
How Zen.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.847
A lot of people
have their dogs neutered, Neal.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.449
It doesn't mean that
Margaret necessarily

01:23.451 --> 01:25.317
meant anything by it.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.053
Compared to Fido,
Neal's getting off easy.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.688
[laughs]

01:30.925 --> 01:33.525
[theme music]

02:01.155 --> 02:03.755
[music continues]

02:32.753 --> 02:34.987
[instrumental music]

02:38.159 --> 02:42.027
Come on, Eric.
Give us a smile.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.595
Give us a big smile.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.498
You could do it. Come on.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.634
'Smile.'

02:48.636 --> 02:50.836
'Now, Kate! Now!'

02:52.306 --> 02:56.875
Good boy. Good boy.
That was the last bite.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.878
They're so easy to
manipulate at this age.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.181
I'll get it.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.715
Oh, if it's Uncle Neal

03:03.717 --> 03:05.484
tell him I'm not here.

03:05.486 --> 03:09.688
Dad. You want me to lie?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.958
It's not a lie,
it's a...relative.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.361
That's how Lizzie Borden
got started.

03:16.363 --> 03:20.832
First she lied to her parents,
then she hacked them to pieces.

03:20.834 --> 03:25.070
Probably looked a lot like this.
Only not so veiny.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.041
Check, please.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.143
Just a second. You're safe, dad.
It's for me.

03:31.145 --> 03:33.478
I'm-I'm gonna take it
in the other room.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.947
You know,
now that I think about it

03:34.949 --> 03:37.482
we haven't heard from
your brother in days.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.685
I think he probably took
the advice I gave him

03:39.687 --> 03:42.487
and started taking charge
of his own life.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.922
That poor guy.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.857
To have invested ten years
with the same person

03:45.859 --> 03:48.694
and have it end so badly.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.562
Well, at least he's got
his storm-door business

03:50.564 --> 03:52.164
to keep him occupied.

03:52.166 --> 03:55.701
Talk about that Tanner zest
for life.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.941
[instrumental music]

04:06.614 --> 04:08.113
- Morning, ALF.
- Morning.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.848
Did dad give
the Ochmoneks permission

04:09.850 --> 04:12.184
to park one of their campers
in our driveway?

04:12.186 --> 04:14.186
You know, this sort of thing
wouldn't happen

04:14.188 --> 04:16.588
if we didn't live in
what Geraldo calls

04:16.590 --> 04:19.224
a marginal neighborhood.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.592
[doorbell rings]

04:20.594 --> 04:22.661
Ugh. Who could that be
at this hour?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.696
Probably someone marginal.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.702
Who could possibly be
ringing our doorbell

04:30.704 --> 04:33.138
at 7:00 in the morning?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.307
It's Neal.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.576
- Neal.
- Surprise!

04:37.578 --> 04:41.680
Oh, yeah, it sure is that.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.749
Well, come on. Come on in.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.317
I hope I'm not ringing
too early.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.618
Oh, nonsense.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.454
No, it's-it's wonderful
to see you.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.490
- Hi, Neal.
- Oh, Lynnie.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.392
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.260
Well,
because the new Neal Tanner

04:55.262 --> 04:57.729
is spontaneous, impetuous.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.334
Oh, you're looking
at my new camper, aren't you?

05:02.336 --> 05:05.671
- That's yours?
- Yeah, isn't she a beauty?

05:05.673 --> 05:08.106
Then those are your boxer shorts
on the antenna.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.976
I didn't realize
you were such a big Batman fan.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.845
I lost the clothesline
just outside of Albuquerque.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.516
I didn't know you liked camping,
Neal.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.786
Well, I don't, actually. Uh..

05:20.788 --> 05:24.956
This was all your idea, Willie.
Don't you remember?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.259
I-I told you to
take up camping?

05:27.261 --> 05:30.595
No, you told me
to grab life by the lapels

05:30.597 --> 05:33.532
and shake my spirit free,
right?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.467
A words to that effect.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.736
Well, I finally did.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.004
I mean, you made me realize

05:39.006 --> 05:42.207
I was living in this
teeny-weeny little rut.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.176
And after Margaret bolted

05:44.178 --> 05:48.213
it just kept getting
teenier and ruttier and..

05:48.215 --> 05:50.115
So I finally did
what you told me to do.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.751
I quit my job,
I gave up my apartment

05:52.753 --> 05:55.420
I traded in the Valiant
and-and I bought that camper

05:55.422 --> 05:58.123
and, well, here I am.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.725
I'm a new man.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.262
I never told you to do
any of those things, Neal.

06:04.264 --> 06:08.734
Well, no, not in so many words.
I sort of read in.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.069
[metal clanging]

06:14.375 --> 06:15.907
Excuse me.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.843
This is a special moment.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.345
Why don't I go make us
an international coffee?

06:20.347 --> 06:21.913
Irish mocha mint?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.451
- ALF.
- What?

06:26.453 --> 06:29.988
I was looking for a shrimp fork.
These are too big.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.624
Just be quiet.
Uncle Neal is here.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.658
I know.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.495
See? It was someone marginal.

06:36.497 --> 06:40.232
By the way, your father's
quite the advice giver.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.768
You know what you get
when you shake life's lapels?

06:42.770 --> 06:45.370
Life's dandruff.
That's what you get.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.675
Shh.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.278
[instrumental music]

07:08.061 --> 07:10.462
Ah, got your, uh,
utilities hooked up.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.730
Oh, thank you.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.098
But really, Neal, you know

07:13.100 --> 07:14.866
you're more than welcome
to sleep in the house.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.301
No, no, no.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.504
The new, independent Neal Tanner
takes care of himself.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.740
Thanks though.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.576
It's really good to see you,
Neal.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.045
It's been a long time.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.313
You know what they say.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.915
Families only seem to
get together

07:29.917 --> 07:32.250
at weddings and funerals.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.287
Now we can add
divorces to that.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.290
Kind of funny, isn't it?

07:38.292 --> 07:40.559
- You're gonna be okay, Neal.
- I know.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.260
You're gonna be okay.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.963
You still make the best
hospital corners in our family.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.932
Yeah. You want me to
come in and do yours?

07:46.934 --> 07:50.335
No, no. No, thanks.
Kate's asleep.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.771
Well, that's no problem.
I can work around her.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.440
I worked around Margaret
all the time.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.609
You mean you doted
on Margaret so much

07:57.611 --> 08:00.312
that she didn't have to get out
of the bed for you to make it?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.381
No sense both of us being up.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.285
But hey,
that's all behind me now.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.854
Now that I've grabbed
life by the lapels

08:08.856 --> 08:10.856
and shaken my spirit free.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.458
Thanks to you.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.861
Yeah.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.296
Yeah, about that, Neal.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.967
Ah, what I really meant was,
I think..

08:21.969 --> 08:25.203
...was sit down, relax

08:25.205 --> 08:28.006
don't make any rash decisions.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.709
Above all,
don't uproot your whole life

08:30.711 --> 08:34.179
and drive into somebody's
driveway in a Winnebago.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.249
You're afraid
I'm gonna be a burden.

08:37.251 --> 08:40.252
No, Neal. No..

08:40.254 --> 08:43.688
I'm just wondering if you really
thought this thing through.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.090
What about your job?

08:45.092 --> 08:47.425
You-you loved
selling storm doors.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.829
I did, but I don't necessarily
think that man was meant to

08:50.831 --> 08:52.631
just do one thing
with his life, Willie.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.133
And n-now is a good time
for me to take some risks.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.035
So, I was thinking about
getting into sunroofs.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.138
What do you think?
Do you know anybody in sunroofs?

09:01.174 --> 09:04.776
- No, afraid not.
- I know.

09:04.778 --> 09:08.280
It's a tough game to crack
unless you know somebody.

09:08.282 --> 09:11.483
But hey, I made it
in storm doors, didn't I?

09:11.485 --> 09:13.318
- Sure did.
- Mm.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.487
You wanna know something?
I'm gonna do it all on my own.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.722
You're looking at the new,
revamped Neal Tanner.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.959
I am strong, I am invincible.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.528
Do you know any women
that fool around?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.863
Just a little.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.000
[instrumental music]

09:36.443 --> 09:39.110
You gonna finish that?

09:39.112 --> 09:43.481
No, I was gonna store it
in my cheeks until winter.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.551
There's more food, Brian.
What would you like thirds of?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.486
Everything.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.855
Where did you learn to cook
so well, Uncle Neal?

09:50.857 --> 09:55.694
Well, breakfast was Margaret's
favorite meal of the afternoon.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.396
Except on weekends,
when she'd sleep late.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.800
You know, sometimes I wonder

10:01.802 --> 10:04.903
where she got the energy
to leave me.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.738
- Good morning, guys.
- Morning, Willie.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.306
What would you like
for breakfast?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.775
Eggs, sausage,
cinnamon rolls, waffles..

10:10.777 --> 10:14.446
Oh, uh...a couple of eggs
and toast will be fine.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.780
Okay.
How would you like those cooked?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.483
Scrambled, over easy,
boiled, fried?

10:19.353 --> 10:21.052
Coddled.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.455
One minute,
two minutes, three minutes?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.992
- Surprise me.
- Roger Wilco.

10:28.862 --> 10:33.298
You know who is not very happy
about you know what.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.102
Well, we'll just have to tell
you know who

10:37.104 --> 10:40.605
that he can go you know where.

10:40.607 --> 10:44.643
He told me to tell you he's made
a voodoo doll in your image.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.244
[chuckles]

10:48.482 --> 10:51.082
[instrumental music]

10:58.592 --> 11:00.759
Nice touch.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.194
Subtle, but it makes a point.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.765
I can understand your feelings,
ALF.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.034
I can also understand
your dilemma.

11:09.036 --> 11:13.204
What I can't understand
is this note.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.741
It's in English.
What don't you understand?

11:16.743 --> 11:19.044
"Dear Neal,
take some advice from a guy

11:19.046 --> 11:21.479
"who loves you like a brother.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.982
"There's a camper
leaving town at noon

11:23.984 --> 11:25.617
"either be in it or under it.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.386
Love, Anonymous."

11:28.388 --> 11:31.389
I love when you read to me.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.224
You left this on
the kitchen table

11:33.226 --> 11:34.459
hoping that Neal would see it

11:34.461 --> 11:36.494
and think it was from me,
didn't you?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.563
Let him draw
his own conclusions.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.533
I didn't say
it was from his brother.

11:41.535 --> 11:45.136
- Clever, yes?
- Clever? No.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.238
Insensitive? Yes.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.974
Contemptuous? Absolutely.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.277
Fortunately,
Neal didn't see it.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.748
If my brother wants to
visit here for a while

11:56.750 --> 11:58.450
he's welcome, ALF.

11:58.452 --> 11:59.718
Fine.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.219
But if you were more forceful

12:01.221 --> 12:03.822
and less sympathetic
to freeloaders

12:03.824 --> 12:06.991
perhaps he'd get the hint.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.727
I'm ending
this conversation now.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.396
But before I go, I'd like you to
imagine what my being

12:11.398 --> 12:13.431
less sympathetic
to freeloaders might mean

12:13.433 --> 12:16.468
to the fate of another member
of this household.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.239
He's right.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.775
Kate would have been history
a long time ago.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.081
[instrumental music]

12:35.122 --> 12:37.288
- How'd your talk with ALF go?
- Oh.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.625
How do my talks
with ALF usually go?

12:40.627 --> 12:43.762
- I'll get your antacid pills.
- Thanks.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.599
He's just, he's got to
accept the fact

12:47.601 --> 12:50.702
that Neal is gonna be here
for a while.

12:52.506 --> 12:57.442
Just for clarity, exactly how
would you define "a while?"

12:57.444 --> 12:59.511
Oh, Kate, don't you start too.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.212
This-this is my kid brother

13:01.214 --> 13:03.782
and he happens to
need me right now.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.184
Willie, I like Neal very much

13:06.186 --> 13:08.253
but he has always used you
to shield himself

13:08.255 --> 13:09.621
from the real world.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.589
That's not true.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.759
You proposed to his ex-wife
for him.

13:14.761 --> 13:18.096
Neal is shy
and is subject to shingles.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.598
I had no choice.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.635
You are obviously too close
to be objective about this.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.437
- I'm objective.
- No, you're not, honey.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.241
Well, why should I be, anyway?
He's my brother.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.743
Look, all I am saying is

13:31.745 --> 13:34.612
if Neal is serious about putting
his life in order

13:34.614 --> 13:37.448
and putting Margaret behind him,
we're not helping.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.784
No matter how well we're eating.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.954
What are you saying, then?

13:42.956 --> 13:44.989
Look, he needs to
learn to fend for himself.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.658
Maybe he needs a little push.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.761
Besides, this whole situation
is not exactly fair to ALF.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.696
[knocking on door]

13:51.698 --> 13:53.965
Speaking of which..

13:53.967 --> 13:56.334
What is it, ALF?

13:57.537 --> 14:00.505
- Willie?
- Neal?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.173
Sorry to bother you so late.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.709
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Neal.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.144
Who's ALF?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.481
ALF?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.383
Willie was talking to me.
He calls me ALF.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.086
Sort of a pet name.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.322
I'm his little ALF.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.691
Oh, that's darling.

14:19.693 --> 14:23.862
You know, I used to call
Margaret my little chicken taco.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.730
That was her favorite snack.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.867
That, and any kind of beef.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.671
Neal, is there
something you wanted?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.473
Oh. T.P.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.843
"T.P.?"

14:38.845 --> 14:40.378
Toilet paper.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.481
I'm plumb out, and I used up
all my napkins too.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.619
I'll get you some.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.787
Thank you, ALF.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.961
[instrumental music]

15:01.835 --> 15:03.701
[burps]
Yeah.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.304
You know, if you eat fast,
you could eat more.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.641
Yeah.
It also adds to the ambience.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.009
I know.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.877
[burps]

15:12.879 --> 15:14.012
Good morning, dad.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.282
Good morning, Lynn, Brian, ALF.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.918
ALF, what are you doing
down here?

15:19.920 --> 15:24.322
- Finishing oatmeal with clams.
- Well, go back upstairs.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.124
Neal could come in here
any minute.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.293
I don't think so.
He's gone.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.396
Gone?
What do you mean gone?

15:31.398 --> 15:34.732
Relax, I don't mean dead.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.735
I saw his boxer shorts
drive by my window.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.273
ALF.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.342
Kate, Neal drove off
in his camper

15:44.344 --> 15:45.376
early this morning.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.478
That's odd.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.781
Well, I'll just mosey on off

15:49.783 --> 15:53.217
to the television area
if no one minds.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.287
Hold it. Somebody minds.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.291
What do you know about this?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.926
About what?

16:01.928 --> 16:04.262
I want you to look me in the eye

16:04.264 --> 16:06.597
and tell me you didn't write him
another note.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.533
I didn't write him
another note.

16:12.172 --> 16:16.274
Uh...pay no attention
to my ears.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.078
Nice try.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.047
I told you this was
none of your concern, didn't I?

16:23.049 --> 16:27.318
Didn't I make it perfectly clear
you were to stay out of this?

16:27.320 --> 16:30.121
Obviously not clear enough.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.358
What exactly did this note say,
ALF?

16:33.360 --> 16:37.362
Well, I seem to recall,
and I'm paraphrasing now

16:37.364 --> 16:41.065
"Amscray,
wearing out your welcome."

16:41.067 --> 16:42.633
Oh, and "deadbeat."

16:42.635 --> 16:46.170
"Sincerely yours,
William Tanner."

16:46.172 --> 16:48.039
You signed my name?

16:48.041 --> 16:51.576
Well, you got mad when I signed
the first one Anonymous.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.644
Is there no pleasing you?

16:54.881 --> 16:57.482
[instrumental music]

17:02.722 --> 17:03.921
Alright.

17:03.923 --> 17:07.759
What do you call a mushroom that
buys all the drinks?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.629
A fungi to be with.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.432
A fungi to be with.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.034
[laughing]

17:17.370 --> 17:20.405
Ah, I kill me.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.974
Would you like any help?

17:22.976 --> 17:25.877
What did I do
that was so terrible?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.646
You hurt Uncle Neal's feelings
and made him leave.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.682
Before he could fix dinner.

17:31.684 --> 17:35.553
You made my own brother
feel unwelcome in my home.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.157
Well, you made me feel unwelcome
in my home.

17:39.159 --> 17:43.428
Neal was my brother long before
you were ever my, my..

17:44.397 --> 17:46.397
What is he, anyway?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.266
Don't get me started.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.568
[doorbell rings]

17:50.570 --> 17:53.504
ALF, hide in the kitchen.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.840
ALF, hide in the kitchen, what?

17:55.842 --> 17:59.644
ALF, hide in the kitchen now.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.680
There, was that so hard?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.954
Neal. Oh, come on in.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.989
I'm so glad you came back.

18:11.991 --> 18:16.294
Oh, we are so sorry you left,
honey.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.297
- Give me your coat.
- Are you hungry? Mom made--

18:19.299 --> 18:23.134
- What was that, anyway?
- Food.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.670
At any rate,
there's plenty left.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.772
Will you cook dinner tomorrow?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.407
[laughs]

18:29.409 --> 18:31.109
What a reception.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.077
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear you all thought

18:33.079 --> 18:35.146
I was gone for good.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.315
Well, I guess we did.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.984
Listen, about that note..

18:39.986 --> 18:42.453
Oh, come on, Willie.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.256
I saw right through
that old trick of yours.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.891
Trick?

18:46.893 --> 18:50.361
Didn't your dad ever tell you
about the Marshall Ludwig story?

18:50.363 --> 18:51.896
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- 'Oh.'

18:51.898 --> 18:54.732
Well, when your dad
and I were kids

18:54.734 --> 18:57.668
Marshall Ludwig
was the meanest bully in school.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.238
He was the only fourth grader
with "Love Hate"

19:00.240 --> 19:02.940
tattooed across his knuckles.
I'm not kidding.

19:02.942 --> 19:07.145
And for some reason, I seemed
to be his favorite target.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.114
Oh,<i> quelle</i> surprise.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.050
Marshall had followed me home
from school that day

19:13.052 --> 19:15.253
and told me that
the next day at recess

19:15.255 --> 19:17.121
he was gonna beat me up so hard

19:17.123 --> 19:20.725
I'd be carrying my head around
in my lunchbox.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.894
And this guy right here

19:22.896 --> 19:25.696
said something
that really made sense.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.233
He said, "Neal, you know why
Marshall picks on you?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.002
It's because you're a sissy."

19:31.004 --> 19:35.840
Ugh. Even as youngsters,
those two were boring.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.310
The next time I saw that bully,
I stood up to him and I said

19:39.312 --> 19:40.745
"You wanna stick my head
in my lunchbox

19:40.747 --> 19:42.146
"that's fine with me

19:42.148 --> 19:44.949
because in no way
am I gonna be a sissy."

19:44.951 --> 19:47.185
Didn't I see this
on "The Wonder Years?"

19:48.655 --> 19:51.022
I knew that Willie wrote that
note this morning

19:51.024 --> 19:54.659
so I'd get mad and I'd stop
feeling sorry for myself

19:54.661 --> 19:57.628
and, well, I'd get out there
and grab life by the lapels

19:57.630 --> 20:01.098
and shake my spirit free.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.401
- Neal?
- Yeah?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.770
Don't use that phrase.
Ever again.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.238
It's incredibly stupid

20:07.240 --> 20:09.840
and I rue the day I said it
in the first place.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.808
Roger Wilco.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.145
Neal, don't use that
phrase either.

20:14.147 --> 20:17.315
Now, where have you been
all day? We were worried.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.551
Well, I traded in the camper

20:20.553 --> 20:22.520
and I put a deposit
on an apartment

20:22.522 --> 20:24.555
not half a mile from here.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.591
I applied for a job

20:26.593 --> 20:29.327
and then I called up Margaret

20:29.329 --> 20:31.095
and when she answered the phone

20:31.097 --> 20:32.997
I hung up on her.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.932
That means
you're gonna stay here?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.267
Roger Wil..

20:37.337 --> 20:39.003
It looks like it.

20:41.241 --> 20:45.109
I hereby re-christen
you Uncle Neal.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.116
[instrumental music]

20:53.686 --> 20:55.519
[laughing]

20:55.521 --> 20:58.222
"Dear sissy,
I know where you live

20:58.224 --> 21:01.626
"and I've got a lunchbox
with your name on it.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.861
"I'm out on a technicality

21:03.863 --> 21:07.531
"and I'm heading your wa..

21:07.533 --> 21:09.734
"Way.

21:09.736 --> 21:14.405
Get out of town.
Best wishes, Marshall Ludwig."

21:14.407 --> 21:16.173
[laughing]

21:16.175 --> 21:18.009
Hiss. Hiss.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.280
- ALF.
- Willie!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.516
Hand that over.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.987
- Oh, my list of errands?
- How many times are we--

21:29.989 --> 21:32.690
(Kate)
'Neal, let me get that
door for you.'

21:32.692 --> 21:34.725
- ALF, go to your attic, quick.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.895
"Go to your attic.
Go to your attic." Boy!

21:40.500 --> 21:42.333
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.735
Neal, you are so good
with that baby.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.504
Oh. Hi, Willie.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.840
I don't know when I've ever
seen him sleep so much.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.809
Yeah, thanks, operator.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.154
Hello, Marshall Ludwig?

22:03.156 --> 22:04.855
Oh, hi, Marshall.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.457
Uh, you don't know me

22:06.459 --> 22:10.761
but, uh, I'm about to make you
a very happy man.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.267
[instrumental music]

22:41.928 --> 22:43.294
[laughs]
