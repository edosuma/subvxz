WEBVTT

00:09.760 --> 00:11.971
This was all The Crow carried?

00:11.971 --> 00:14.306
Assassins travel light.

00:19.228 --> 00:22.356
One-way to Carreras.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.817
Do you think Hitler is there?

00:24.817 --> 00:28.612
Klaus said The Crow is
the only one who sees him.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.990
So we go?

00:30.990 --> 00:32.950
Go scout.
See what you find.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.536
Take the counterfeiter
and the actor.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.246
Ima, the actor is a liability.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.414
He's right for this.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.707
And if he doesn't come back, well,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.625
that's the cost
of what we do.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.836
The cost of what we do?

00:43.836 --> 00:45.755
You'll stay here with me.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.047
Oh, Ima...

00:47.047 --> 00:48.591
You will stay here!

00:52.261 --> 00:54.346
Be discreet.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.641
Hitler is in our fucking reach.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.855
Careful out there.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.193
I'll make a mess of 'em.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.905
Not of the Jews.

01:13.032 --> 01:16.702
Of Joe.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.413
When he sees them,
you can't know for certain

01:19.413 --> 01:22.208
how he'll respond.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.126
Loyalty can be buried deep.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.590
So, too, can love.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.885
Let's go kill
some Jews, boys.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.582
<i>I want to thank one
person without whose generosity</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:09.667
<i>none of this would be possible:</i>

04:09.667 --> 04:12.002
Meyer Offerman.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.505
Meyer, come up here, please.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.882
Oh...

04:16.882 --> 04:18.384
Please.

04:18.384 --> 04:21.303
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.473
I, I always knew
I'd make it to the stage.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.892
Thank you very much.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.980
Well, I'm... I'm very pleased

04:30.980 --> 04:32.982
we could all be here together.

04:32.982 --> 04:37.486
Although I'm afraid,
uh, we may lose

04:37.486 --> 04:40.948
some of these, uh,
wonderful Jewish scholars

04:40.948 --> 04:42.866
to the Great White Way now.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.868
I don't know,
I'm a little worried.

04:44.868 --> 04:48.497
Should I be worried about this?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.582
For your generous mitzvah,
we thought it fitting

04:50.582 --> 04:54.461
to commemorate this as
the Meyer Offerman Theater

04:54.461 --> 04:58.048
of Temple Israel.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.050
Thank you

05:00.050 --> 05:01.802
<i>very much.</i>

05:01.802 --> 05:03.846
They want $30 million, huh?

05:05.264 --> 05:08.308
Well, you tell them that we'll
gladly increase production.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.685
What is that?

05:09.685 --> 05:12.104
Yeah, let me call you back.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.940
What the...?
Edward!

05:16.358 --> 05:19.236
What the...?
Where the fuck is he?

05:23.115 --> 05:25.325
Oh!

05:33.709 --> 05:34.835
It's...

05:36.378 --> 05:37.504
You.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.304
 <i>Please just
l-let me explain.</i>

05:45.304 --> 05:47.848
A couple of days ago,
I saw the name

05:47.848 --> 05:49.850
of a woman on our
telephone pad

05:49.850 --> 05:51.977
and an address in L.A.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.353
So, of course, I got a feeling,

05:53.353 --> 05:56.982
and I called Professor Morél's
office.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.026
He said there was
no trip to Israel.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.946
And then I called American
Express, and there it was.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.199
A charge for two weeks

06:05.199 --> 06:08.077
at the Palladio Hotel
in Buenos Aires.

06:09.453 --> 06:14.083
So I had a few drinks,
and, uh, next thing I knew,

06:14.083 --> 06:16.335
I was on a plane here.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.673
It really was, like,
right out of a bad movie.

06:23.509 --> 06:26.678
So, how's the room service?

06:26.678 --> 06:28.514
- Clara.
- Who's Millie, Sam?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.900
Are you in love with her?

06:43.112 --> 06:44.863
She's an FBI agent.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.198
An FBI agent?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.867
She investigated
my grandmother's murder.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.703
I flew to Los Angeles
to see her

06:51.703 --> 06:54.957
because I found something
about someone...

06:54.957 --> 06:59.628
Someone I had been looking for
for a long time.

06:59.628 --> 07:03.090
And that person is here
in Argentina.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.174
Who?

07:05.843 --> 07:08.512
My grandmother's sister Chava.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.098
My <i>safta</i> thought that she was
the only one in her family

07:11.098 --> 07:12.391
who survived the war.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.602
Well, it turns out, I was
doing my thesis research,

07:15.602 --> 07:19.189
and I came across the name
of a survivor:

07:19.189 --> 07:20.566
Chava Apfelbaum.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.693
I looked deeper
and I discovered that

07:22.693 --> 07:24.403
she had escaped the camps,

07:24.403 --> 07:27.030
and so I flew to Los Angeles
to ask Millie for help.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.075
She discovered that
she was alive, living here.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.660
So I came to find her.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.747
Why didn't you tell me?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.124
It was stupid.
I fucked up.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.251
I'm sorry, it's just I-I...

07:39.251 --> 07:40.627
I wanted to make sure
that it was real.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.590
I-I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I-I screwed up.

07:44.590 --> 07:48.177
I know I'm never going
to fill the void

07:48.177 --> 07:51.722
that your grandmother left, but...

07:51.722 --> 07:56.059
if you let me live in it
with you,

07:56.059 --> 07:58.562
it won't feel as big.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.480
I love you.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.941
I'm sorry.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.323
I'm so sorry. Okay?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.830
Well, I want to meet her.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.415
- You want to meet her?
- Yeah.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.791
- No.
- What?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.793
No, I don't think...
She's...

08:21.793 --> 08:23.003
- What?
- Weird.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.963
I mean, being weird is
sort of part

08:24.963 --> 08:26.173
of being a great-aunt, innit?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.674
Uh...

08:27.674 --> 08:29.843
- Lunch today.
- Today?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.595
- Yeah.
- I don't even think
that's possible to...

08:31.595 --> 08:34.431
- Not a question, love.
- Lunch sounds nice.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.225
Hmm.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.208
You think I don't know
the cost it takes

09:01.208 --> 09:03.752
to lie to those you've loved
for years?

09:03.752 --> 09:07.130
I was the one who lied to Ruth.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.883
Knowing what I knew,
keeping it from her.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.220
So don't you dare woe poetic
when it was me

09:13.220 --> 09:17.474
who carried the weight
for you, Ima.

09:22.646 --> 09:26.316
We all have a right
to our own pasts, Rebecca.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.154
I do to mine,
as you do to yours.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.995
I've found him.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.080
It's him.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.627
It's not.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.546
It is.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.760
- It's not.
- It is.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.930
What did I tell you
the first day we met?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.182
I promised you I would find him.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.184
It took a while.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.395
But I always deliver

10:03.395 --> 10:05.397
on my promises.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.528
Thank you, Ima.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.239
Thank you, thank you.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.326
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

10:22.497 --> 10:23.874
You should go.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.335
Georges and the others
will be gone most of the day.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.462
This might be
the only chance you ever have.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
Thank you.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.935
<i>I am not that man.
You are not a Christian.</i>

10:43.935 --> 10:45.187
<i>You are.</i>

10:45.187 --> 10:46.438
<i>- I won't.
- You will.</i>

10:46.438 --> 10:48.190
<i>You are
not a woman of God.</i>

10:49.858 --> 10:51.860
<i>I am not that man.</i>

11:02.120 --> 11:04.122
<i>Hello.</i>

11:04.122 --> 11:05.916
<i>Hello?</i>

11:05.916 --> 11:08.460
Danny?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.128
<i>Millie.</i>

11:10.128 --> 11:12.381
<i>Millie, where the fuck
have you been?</i>

11:12.381 --> 11:14.049
I had to get out of L.A.
for a couple days.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.926
<i>Millie, listen...</i>

11:15.926 --> 11:18.053
Listen, um...

11:18.053 --> 11:20.430
You write in your book...

11:20.430 --> 11:23.558
that, uh, Agent Melanie, uh...

11:23.558 --> 11:26.061
whatever the fuck...

11:26.061 --> 11:28.855
she can do no wrong,
and that if she does it,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.774
it isn't wrong.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.694
Do you believe that?

11:35.862 --> 11:40.283
<i>The Feds called me, Millie,
they're looking for you.</i>

11:40.283 --> 11:41.785
<i>What did you do?</i>

11:49.126 --> 11:51.086
You okay?

11:51.086 --> 11:53.630
Yup.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.299
- Where are you going?
- Just out of the city

11:56.299 --> 11:57.384
for a bit to retrieve

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
some of Klaus Rhinehart's
investment papers.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
- Nothing exciting.
- Okay, I'll go with you.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.183
Look, I can't stay here all day.
I'll go crazy.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.228
Come on, then.

12:09.813 --> 12:10.814
<i>There are
two Nazi sympathizers</i>

12:10.814 --> 12:12.691
living in this town.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.818
If the Crow was coming here
to see Hitler,

12:14.818 --> 12:17.404
I bet these two are
the gatekeepers.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.072
They own an antique store.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.575
The two of you will pose
as newlyweds,

12:21.575 --> 12:23.535
and I will be
your interior designer.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.537
Why couldn't you
play my husband?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.205
An audience would never believe

12:27.205 --> 12:30.459
such a beautiful woman
being married to this...

12:30.459 --> 12:33.545
gorgeous, gorgeous man.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.131
I love antiquing.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.424
You ever been to the Berkshires?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.176
There's this tiny place
in Lenox...

12:39.176 --> 12:41.428
Oh, my God,
like, the cutest lamps.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.097
You all right?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.141
Yeah, I'm golden. Peachy.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.560
Teflon. Teflon.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.395
Teflonny Flash.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.231
Baby, come on.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.361
You're fucking high?

12:58.361 --> 12:59.571
Just a little pick-me-up
for the time change.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.489
Again, Lonny?

13:00.489 --> 13:01.781
Okay, fuck you.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.116
Again?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.784
You could've
fucked all of this up.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.994
Put us all in danger.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.871
When did you even start
with this shit?

13:07.871 --> 13:10.916
Do you know what I am putting
on the line to be here?

13:10.916 --> 13:13.210
What I am risking?
Why'd you even fucking come

13:13.210 --> 13:14.836
to Argentina?!

13:14.836 --> 13:16.880
Because of you, huh.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.549
Because you were coming!

13:19.549 --> 13:22.219
And I started with this shit

13:22.219 --> 13:24.638
when you left, okay?!

13:24.638 --> 13:26.348
Okay?!

13:30.602 --> 13:31.770
Lonny!

13:32.812 --> 13:34.856
Lonny!

13:35.899 --> 13:37.984
<i>And how can you be
sure it was him that you saw?</i>

13:37.984 --> 13:40.403
That it was this Mr...

13:40.403 --> 13:41.738
Von Staub.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.782
Because,

13:43.782 --> 13:46.117
Mr. Attorney General,

13:46.117 --> 13:48.787
my eyes can't forget

13:48.787 --> 13:51.456
the face of a man
who murdered children.

13:51.456 --> 13:55.126
- Ms. Apfelbaum...
- Ms. Apfelbaum. I know.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.087
We've been to other offices

13:57.087 --> 14:00.549
just like this one,
all high-ranking officials,

14:00.549 --> 14:02.759
and they all say the same thing.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.636
Well, I don't need to hear

14:04.636 --> 14:07.013
another patronizing rejection

14:07.013 --> 14:09.015
from a man so busy,

14:09.015 --> 14:12.227
he has no time to investigate

14:12.227 --> 14:13.937
crimes against the Jews.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.990
She's a feisty one.

14:24.990 --> 14:28.451
Yes, she always has been.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.537
Look, Louie,
I'm sorry about her,

14:30.537 --> 14:33.582
but thank you for your time.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.959
I'll look into it.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.627
What?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.046
I'll investigate it.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.841
What? Oh, no,
that's all right, really.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.509
I'll put my team on it.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.138
Don't. Uh...

14:48.138 --> 14:51.349
She's an old woman.
She's got a lot of pain

14:51.349 --> 14:53.184
and confusion, and, uh,

14:53.184 --> 14:56.021
I don't believe
that there's much truth

14:56.021 --> 14:57.647
in what she says.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.150
I don't want to waste your time,

15:00.150 --> 15:01.484
but she's a friend,

15:01.484 --> 15:05.989
so I-I-I just wanted her
to feel heard.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.240
I understand.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.576
Thank you, Louis.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.705
<i>I was so sure</i>

15:13.705 --> 15:16.875
that your friends,
that your connections, that...

15:16.875 --> 15:18.418
- Uh-huh.
- ...the senators,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.630
the congressmen,
the attorney general...

15:21.630 --> 15:22.922
Nothing, we got nothing.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.883
No one believes us.

15:24.883 --> 15:29.137
Never again, we said,
never again.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.056
I am not going to stop.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.350
You're not gonna let this go,
are you?

15:33.350 --> 15:36.353
I can't. Can you?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.152
What if we did it ourselves?

15:47.906 --> 15:50.700
We get a team,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.328
and we do it ourselves.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.667
This is the girl
you're going to marry?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.293
One who travels halfway

16:00.293 --> 16:02.587
across the world
because she read a name

16:02.587 --> 16:05.757
on a fucking telephone pad?

16:05.757 --> 16:08.093
She's clearly unhinged.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.680
What?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.390
She's actually brilliant,

16:13.390 --> 16:16.351
and if I call off our plans,

16:16.351 --> 16:18.103
she's gonna grow suspicious.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.521
She's gonna find out
what we're up to.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.356
So, lunch, the three of us.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.484
What? You think
I'm happy about this?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.944
I asked Mindy
to pretend to be you,

16:25.944 --> 16:27.320
but she's recuperating in bed,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.697
watching Argentinian
soap operas.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.281
You like this girl?

16:31.950 --> 16:35.704
I love this girl.
She's gonna be my wife.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.456
Then I'm not breaking bread
with her.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.459
If you love this girl,
you will tell her that you lied

16:41.459 --> 16:43.545
about your great-aunt

16:43.545 --> 16:45.004
and that you're actually here

16:45.004 --> 16:47.090
with another girl,
having a fling,

16:47.090 --> 16:49.592
and that you're calling off
the wedding.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.761
Boom. Done. Over.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.305
She's going to be
my family, Chava.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.598
She's gonna be yours.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.685
She's coming over
for lunch, and then

16:58.685 --> 17:00.937
she's gonna fly home
and not suspect a thing,

17:00.937 --> 17:03.523
and then we'll find Hitler
and we'll kill him,

17:03.523 --> 17:05.775
and then I hang it up.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.944
I fly back to Paris,
marry Clara,

17:07.944 --> 17:10.405
grow old, boring,
and happy together.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.948
And that's what happens.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.533
That's what happens for me.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.161
No. That's what happens for Sam.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.996
It's not what happens for you.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.541
You knew about me
even after she died,

17:21.541 --> 17:24.252
and you still never reached out.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.755
This is the least
that you can do.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.258
I'll make chicken.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.760
I'll make a reservation.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.094
That's not how she meets family.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.306
I'm making chicken.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.519
Chicken it is.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.357
What are we gonna do, Biz?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.692
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.862
We're gonna feed 'em
some bullets on Mars.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.163
Cut.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.250
Very nice.
Okay, we're moving on.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.836
Great take.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.338
All right. I think we got it.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.090
I'm gonna be in my trailer.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.427
I think we got that.
That was a great take.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.263
"Bullets on Mars."

19:03.560 --> 19:06.062
Fuck off.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.146
Fuck.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.110
No, no.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.070
- The fuck?
- Get out.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.488
Come on.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.532
Get out.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.287
The fuck? Who the fuck are you?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.289
Who the fuck are you?

19:24.289 --> 19:25.456
You're a mess.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.041
You belong in an outhouse,

19:27.041 --> 19:28.668
- you schmuck.
- I'm calling security.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.253
- Get out of here.
- Aah! Fuck.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.504
What the fuck, man?!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.673
I'm security, all right?!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.758
I don't give a fuck
who you call.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.886
You drink yourself
into oblivion.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.180
Set us back a hundred years
with all these fucking stories.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.849
Look at this.
Give us a bad name.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.183
You know what they say?
They say,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.311
"Oh, there goes the Jew again."

19:46.311 --> 19:49.522
You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.901
Who the fuck are you? And how
did you fucking get in here?

19:52.901 --> 19:54.694
You know, your grandfather
was just like you.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.821
My grandfather?

19:56.821 --> 19:58.531
Son of a bitch diva.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.575
Chevy Chase
of the Yiddish Theater.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.161
But for all his ass-fuckery,

20:03.161 --> 20:04.829
he was a great actor.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.206
W-Wait-wait, you...

20:07.206 --> 20:10.418
- you knew my grandfather?
- Not personally, no, but...

20:10.418 --> 20:12.712
But you know about him?

20:14.172 --> 20:17.133
Well, my-my-my father
rarely spoke about him.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.053
Well, your grandfather was

20:20.053 --> 20:21.596
imprisoned in the camps.

20:21.596 --> 20:24.057
And every Shabbos,

20:24.057 --> 20:25.767
late at night,

20:25.767 --> 20:28.895
your grandfather would perform.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.480
All the greats.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.691
Sholem Aleichem,
Brecht, Shakespeare.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.944
"Hath not a Jew eyes?

20:35.944 --> 20:38.071
Hath not a Jew hands, organs,

20:38.071 --> 20:40.740
dimensions, senses?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.992
If you prick us,

20:42.992 --> 20:44.827
do we not bleed?"

20:44.827 --> 20:47.747
The guards discovered him,
of course.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.916
They shot him twice. Dead.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.836
But every Shabbos

20:53.836 --> 20:57.256
he freed those men
in that cell block.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.927
Transporting them
to worlds far away.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.099
<i>Bullets on Mars 2?</i>

21:06.099 --> 21:10.019
The fuck is...
What the fuck is this?

21:11.479 --> 21:13.439
You once did <i>Hamlet.</i>

21:13.439 --> 21:15.108
You played in <i>Othello.</i>

21:15.108 --> 21:17.860
"Greatest young actor
of our time."

21:17.860 --> 21:19.278
What happened?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.825
I don't know.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.787
I don't know, it just, uh...

21:27.787 --> 21:29.622
it just happened.

21:31.332 --> 21:34.669
You are Fyvel Flazenstein's
grandchild.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.257
You're made
of the same stuff as he is.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.385
Believe me, I see him in you.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.263
And I see you, Leonard.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.306
I do, I see you.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.520
I'm here with an opportunity

21:52.520 --> 21:54.230
for you,

21:54.230 --> 21:56.858
greater than any role
you could ever play.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.785
Can I sit?

22:19.797 --> 22:21.758
You do what you want
with your life, Lonny,

22:21.758 --> 22:25.094
but if you want to do this,
you need to be sober.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.264
For our lives

22:28.264 --> 22:30.266
and for hers.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.688
I was in hell.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.524
Well, we don't believe in hell,
which is awesome, but

22:38.524 --> 22:41.235
I was in our version of hell.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.446
Last time I was using,

22:43.446 --> 22:45.448
every minute of every day,

22:45.448 --> 22:47.658
high off my tuchus.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.660
Snorting, sniffing,

22:49.660 --> 22:52.163
tasting, smacking,
downing, sucking

22:52.163 --> 22:55.333
everything and everyone,
so that I wouldn't

22:55.333 --> 22:58.377
see my face,

22:58.377 --> 23:01.964
so that I couldn't
remember my name,

23:01.964 --> 23:04.467
so I didn't know I was alone.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.596
So then, one day,

23:08.596 --> 23:11.057
this old man
comes to my trailer

23:11.057 --> 23:13.976
and he starts telling me
a story about my grandfather.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.895
About what a hero he was.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.814
And how I'm made of him.

23:17.814 --> 23:21.025
And how I could be
just like him.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.614
So I took the dagger

23:26.614 --> 23:28.491
and I joined a family.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.372
And I really felt that I...

23:36.624 --> 23:38.376
...was somebody, you know?

23:38.376 --> 23:41.838
That I... existed.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.550
And the funny thing is...

23:47.510 --> 23:49.804
...it was all a lie.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.974
He didn't know my grandfather.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.810
And I realize now,

23:55.810 --> 23:58.104
he didn't know me.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.610
I watched them all.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.530
Your films.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.449
And you are a terrible actor.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.285
Not the roles

24:12.285 --> 24:14.954
in your films.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.791
But this role, Lonny Flash.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.793
Because your greatest

24:20.793 --> 24:23.004
role is the one

24:23.004 --> 24:26.174
you've been born to play.

24:26.174 --> 24:30.303
Leonard Flazenstein.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.804
You.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.057
And I think she would agree.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.186
That is the role she would love.

24:38.186 --> 24:41.272
The one role Roxy
could love you as, too.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.191
The real you.

24:44.775 --> 24:47.153
God, you are really
good-looking.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.740
I-I really...
I find it annoying.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.870
We should go
find the Stammers.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.122
- Mm, Lonny.
- What?

24:58.122 --> 25:01.125
Chava sent the three of us
for a reason.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.668
You need me.

25:08.716 --> 25:09.842
<i>When we get there,</i>

25:09.842 --> 25:11.969
<i>I'll need you
to stay in the car.</i>

25:11.969 --> 25:13.471
<i>So, where
are we going, Harriet?</i>

25:13.471 --> 25:16.265
I know it's not simply
to round up some files.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.979
I'm going to find a man.

25:21.979 --> 25:25.399
A man I've been looking for
for a very long time.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.151
<i>O come ♪</i>

25:27.151 --> 25:30.154
<i>All ye faithful ♪</i>

25:30.154 --> 25:34.158
<i>Joyful and triumphant ♪</i>

25:34.158 --> 25:38.537
<i>O come ye, O come ye ♪</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:43.417
<i>To Bethlehem ♪</i>

25:43.417 --> 25:46.128
<i>Come and behold ♪</i>

25:46.128 --> 25:47.922
<i>Him ♪</i>

25:47.922 --> 25:51.133
<i>Born the King of Angels... ♪</i>

25:51.133 --> 25:53.970
Do they know any
Kool the Gang?

25:53.970 --> 25:57.056
<i>Adore him, O come... ♪</i>

25:57.056 --> 25:58.808
Meyer Offerman.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.935
<i>Adore him... ♪</i>

26:00.935 --> 26:04.313
Mother Superior gusted my wind

26:04.313 --> 26:05.773
in your direction.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.360
She said the orphanage
needed a new roof,

26:09.360 --> 26:11.779
new boiler, 20 new beds.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.326
And I happen to be in the market

26:17.326 --> 26:19.203
for making a sizable

26:19.203 --> 26:22.039
donation.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.666
Oh.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.377
That is quite charitable

26:26.377 --> 26:28.129
of you, Mr...

26:28.129 --> 26:31.215
- Offerman. Yeah.
- Offerman. Thank you.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.426
But if I may,

26:33.426 --> 26:35.303
what interest
does a bloke like you

26:35.303 --> 26:37.305
have in donating to the Church?

26:37.305 --> 26:39.724
A bloke like me?

26:39.724 --> 26:41.851
What, you mean a Jew?

26:41.851 --> 26:44.812
Well, what business
does a woman like you have

26:44.812 --> 26:47.773
donating herself
to the Church, hmm?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.900
I'm sorry?

26:49.900 --> 26:52.278
What? Your father was Jewish.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.156
Oh, Jesus was a Jew, yes.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.615
Not Jesus, Harriet.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.702
Your father, Rebecca.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.537
Your father.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.581
Hiram Kreutzer.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.169
You can still hear it,
can't you?

27:08.169 --> 27:11.172
The screams of the steam engine

27:11.172 --> 27:15.051
as-as your father
hands you off to a woman

27:15.051 --> 27:17.178
through the train window.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.057
Perhaps he told you you were
just going on a holiday.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.976
How long until you understood

27:23.976 --> 27:25.686
why your father did this?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.444
Now listen closely,
you wrinkled old prat.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.988
If you think I would
hesitate to cut your

27:35.988 --> 27:38.491
proliferous head
off your motherfucking neck

27:38.491 --> 27:41.494
in front of these
dear, dear, little angels,

27:41.494 --> 27:43.079
you are sorely mistaken.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.790
Thank you.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.459
This is precisely why I'm here.

27:48.459 --> 27:52.171
I read your file.
Oxford. MI6.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.966
My colleagues and I
are putting together a team

27:55.966 --> 28:00.304
to bring fugitive Nazi scum

28:00.304 --> 28:02.556
to their bloody end.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.189
Never.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.566
Sorry?

28:12.566 --> 28:14.652
You asked

28:14.652 --> 28:17.738
when I finally knew
what my father had done for me,

28:17.738 --> 28:20.616
and the answer is never because
I should have died with him.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.701
I would have sooner died
with him

28:22.701 --> 28:25.079
if it meant even
one more day in his arms.

28:25.079 --> 28:29.333
So, thank you, Mr. Offerman.
I'm sorry you came all this way.

28:30.668 --> 28:34.463
If you wish to repay your fare,

28:34.463 --> 28:36.715
to avenge your father's death,

28:36.715 --> 28:38.467
you're not gonna find that

28:38.467 --> 28:41.846
with pageants and charity.

28:41.846 --> 28:44.932
You must join this cause.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.143
It's the only way.

28:47.143 --> 28:51.689
Your father only
put you on that train

28:51.689 --> 28:55.776
so that one day

28:55.776 --> 28:58.612
you could get off.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.287
Don't be nervous.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.788
I'm not nervous. I'm Jewish.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.707
This is what we look like
all the time.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.208
Hello?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.505
- Hello?
- Shalom, shalom.

29:16.505 --> 29:20.468
My darling nephew. [gasps] Oh,

29:20.468 --> 29:23.262
my goodness, you must be...

29:23.262 --> 29:24.430
Clara.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.891
It's so lovely to meet you.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.231
Hmm, hmm.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.733
Look at you.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.985
I can hardly see
your <i>shyna punim</i>

29:37.985 --> 29:39.695
behind all those flowers.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.114
So thoughtful.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.450
Come in, come in.

30:16.774 --> 30:18.442
That's their hotel.

30:24.865 --> 30:28.702
This is delicious. Thank you.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.704
It's an old recipe.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.957
I'm sure you've
never had it before.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.833
It's a Jewish staple.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.212
Sam's great-great-grandmother's
recipe.

30:38.212 --> 30:41.924
One's history is everything.

30:41.924 --> 30:46.220
So, Chava, uh,
why South America?

30:46.220 --> 30:47.930
Hmm...

30:47.930 --> 30:51.225
Well, I-I-I lived in London
for a time.

30:51.225 --> 30:54.228
And I moved down here
about ten years ago for work.

30:54.228 --> 30:55.854
There was a particular account

30:55.854 --> 30:58.482
I was pursuing many years now.

30:58.482 --> 30:59.608
How wonderful.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.901
And did you land the account?

31:00.901 --> 31:03.779
Mm. Not yet,

31:03.779 --> 31:05.531
- but I love the chase.
- You know, Clara...

31:05.531 --> 31:07.992
...is studying

31:07.992 --> 31:10.703
neuropsychiatry at the Sorbonne.

31:10.703 --> 31:11.954
She's actually up for

31:11.954 --> 31:14.081
a big position
at a top research clinic.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.958
Wow.

31:15.958 --> 31:19.628
Neuropsychiatry.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.964
- What do your parents do, dear?
- Oh,

31:21.964 --> 31:24.592
they're art collectors in
London. They-they have a gallery

31:24.592 --> 31:26.885
down on Savile Row.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.512
Art collectors.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.515
Hmm. It's a nice

31:31.515 --> 31:33.183
pastime for rich people,

31:33.183 --> 31:35.185
isn't it?

31:35.185 --> 31:36.437
Collecting.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.105
Taking something that doesn't...

31:38.105 --> 31:40.190
doesn't quite belong to you

31:40.190 --> 31:42.234
but claiming it as your own.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.821
So...

31:45.821 --> 31:48.741
when is the big day?

31:48.741 --> 31:50.993
October 10th in Paris.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.119
October?

31:52.119 --> 31:55.706
I'll be losing you
so soon... Sam.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.877
But you'll be gaining me.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.844
So, it will be a Jewish wedding?

32:10.721 --> 32:13.390
You know, I still have
your great-grandfather's tallit.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.309
Not gonna be wearing a tallit.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.477
Why not?

32:16.477 --> 32:18.520
Because

32:18.520 --> 32:20.230
you marry a shiksa,

32:20.230 --> 32:22.399
you're going to erase
who you are?

32:22.399 --> 32:24.526
What your

32:24.526 --> 32:26.570
ancestors fought for?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.113
Died for?

32:29.907 --> 32:33.619
Your <i>safta</i> must be
rolling over in her grave.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.997
If Sam wants
a Jewish wedding,

32:36.997 --> 32:38.791
I would love to honor that.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.919
The past year and a half,

32:41.919 --> 32:43.545
I've learned
how to bake challah,

32:43.545 --> 32:45.964
I've sung Dayenu,
I-I've held two seders,

32:45.964 --> 32:48.384
I've spun dreidels,
I've listened

32:48.384 --> 32:50.552
to the shofar's blow
and the minyan chants

32:50.552 --> 32:52.805
and Lenny Bruce's
"I Am Not A Nut, Elect Me."

32:52.805 --> 32:54.932
I don't ever want

32:54.932 --> 32:56.600
Sam to erase who he is.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.310
I fell in love with him
for who he is,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.479
and that includes
his Jewishness.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.440
I don't know what

33:03.440 --> 33:04.983
you thought I'd be,

33:04.983 --> 33:07.820
but I love him, Chava,

33:07.820 --> 33:09.029
with all my heart.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.031
And...

33:11.031 --> 33:14.493
he loves me with all of his.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.580
He is the kindest,

33:18.580 --> 33:20.916
gentlest,

33:20.916 --> 33:22.459
most loyal person

33:22.459 --> 33:24.878
I know.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.718
I had a love once.

33:31.885 --> 33:35.472
One that I would make
a silly speech like that for.

33:37.808 --> 33:40.144
His name was Zev.

33:40.144 --> 33:42.563
We met after the war.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.482
We're both in the same line
of-of work.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.901
We fell in love.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.614
We were together for 20 years,
but then one of us

33:52.614 --> 33:54.825
put the other before the work.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.118
And the other...

33:56.118 --> 33:58.495
Well...

33:58.495 --> 34:00.831
she believes

34:00.831 --> 34:02.624
that the work

34:02.624 --> 34:04.918
is the most important
thing of all.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.258
Zev sounds
like a lucky man...

34:11.258 --> 34:14.428
to have been able to love you

34:14.428 --> 34:15.929
for as long as he did.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.645
Perhaps we should have
some more wine.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.189
I think we've, uh,
had enough wine, right?

34:25.189 --> 34:28.400
No, I'll... I'll join you,

34:28.400 --> 34:31.403
but could this shiksa

34:31.403 --> 34:33.197
use the loo first?

34:33.197 --> 34:36.450
Of course, dear.
It's just down that long hall.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.503
She's too good for you.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.492
Good morning,
I'm here to see...

35:18.492 --> 35:19.618
...my father.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.652
It's been a long time.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.242
Are you here for my confession?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.329
No.

36:06.123 --> 36:09.668
No, I'm here for mine.
Would that be all right?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.503
I...

36:47.873 --> 36:51.752
When I was a little girl,

36:51.752 --> 36:54.922
my father...

36:54.922 --> 36:56.924
he placed me on a train,

36:56.924 --> 37:01.261
a train that was supposed
to take me to a safe haven,

37:01.261 --> 37:05.515
and he promised me, my father,

37:05.515 --> 37:07.976
that one day
he would return for me

37:07.976 --> 37:10.729
and I would be back
in his arms again.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.024
And I'm here.

37:14.024 --> 37:18.111
I've traveled all this way,
traveled all this time,

37:18.111 --> 37:20.989
because my father lied.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.620
He promised me

37:26.620 --> 37:28.956
he would see me again one day,

37:28.956 --> 37:31.083
and I'm here

37:31.083 --> 37:33.251
to ask you why.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.004
I'm here to ask you why he lied.

37:36.004 --> 37:39.383
Because only you know.

37:39.383 --> 37:41.927
Only you can know.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.680
Only you have the answer

37:44.680 --> 37:47.516
because you are the answer.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.726
Because you turned

37:49.726 --> 37:51.895
that promise into a lie

37:51.895 --> 37:55.065
when you shot my father dead
at Bergen-Belsen,

37:55.065 --> 37:58.568
July 2, 1943.
Isn't that right,

37:58.568 --> 38:00.487
Herr Müntz?

38:12.749 --> 38:15.711
I am sorry to you.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.274
I'm sorry to you.

40:32.139 --> 40:32.973
Hi.

40:33.765 --> 40:34.808
How could I help you?

40:34.808 --> 40:37.018
<i>Hola.</i>

40:37.018 --> 40:38.520
My name
is Antonio Costa.

40:38.520 --> 40:42.065
These are my clients,
Kate and Hamish Hughes.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.902
They have just purchased
a vacation home nearby...

40:45.902 --> 40:47.154
...and are looking
to furnish it.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.659
I'm afraid we are
closing early today.

40:52.659 --> 40:56.079
We'll look around quickly.

40:56.079 --> 40:59.416
May I use your washroom?
It was quite a long trip.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.336
It's in back.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.148
Careful with that.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.274
Relax.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.776
Don't.

42:09.486 --> 42:10.612
What is this?

42:10.612 --> 42:12.197
- We don't know.
- It's not Hitler

42:12.197 --> 42:13.323
that they're harboring.

42:13.323 --> 42:16.201
It's Josef fucking Mengele.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.787
The Angel of Death.

42:18.787 --> 42:21.081
Where is he? Hmm?

42:21.081 --> 42:22.415
Where is Mengele?

42:22.415 --> 42:23.959
- He's not here.
- Gitta.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.044
Speak up. Where is he now?

42:26.044 --> 42:27.379
Dead.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.380
Bullshit.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.674
Three months ago,

42:30.674 --> 42:33.593
he went on vacation and...

42:33.593 --> 42:35.428
he got a stroke
while he was swimming

42:35.428 --> 42:36.638
and he drowned.

42:36.638 --> 42:40.100
We didn't know who he was
for a long time. Honest.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.937
It wasn't until a few years ago
that we discovered his identity.

42:43.937 --> 42:47.524
When he died,
we went to the papers.

42:47.524 --> 42:49.985
We tried to sell the story.

42:49.985 --> 42:54.030
Yeah, and then we got a call
from an old lady.

42:54.030 --> 42:57.117
She promised to get on a train
and bring us $2 million

42:57.117 --> 42:59.202
to keep quiet.

43:00.203 --> 43:02.414
The Crow.

43:02.414 --> 43:05.542
And with all that money...

43:05.542 --> 43:08.211
we'd never have to work again.

43:11.047 --> 43:12.424
It's the horseradish
that makes it.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.759
If anyone ever tells you
they don't like horseradish,

43:14.759 --> 43:16.344
you run in the other direction.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.722
What are the cages for?

43:24.227 --> 43:26.354
I'm a part-time
illusionist, dear.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.023
Didn't Sam tell you?

43:28.023 --> 43:29.524
Aunt Chava's an artist.

43:29.524 --> 43:31.151
A performance artist.

43:31.151 --> 43:33.528
There are surveillance photos

43:33.528 --> 43:37.324
and maps and names
of SS officers

43:37.324 --> 43:39.576
and knives and guns.

43:39.576 --> 43:41.953
Yes.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.455
We hunt Nazis.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.461
She's joking.

43:49.461 --> 43:52.130
- She's-she's joking.
- I'm not joking.

43:52.130 --> 43:55.592
That is precisely what we do.

43:55.592 --> 43:57.218
We hunt Nazis

43:57.218 --> 44:00.638
and we rid them from this Earth.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.432
If Clara is to be family,

44:02.432 --> 44:05.477
she has a right to know what
the family business is, Jonah.

44:09.773 --> 44:13.151
His name is Jonah,
as in "and the whale."

44:13.151 --> 44:14.778
Jonah Heidelbaum.

44:14.778 --> 44:17.447
Not sure where
Sam Rabinow came from,

44:17.447 --> 44:19.199
- but it has a certain ring.
- Clara.

44:19.199 --> 44:21.159
Clara, don't...

44:21.159 --> 44:23.078
Clara!

44:23.078 --> 44:25.497
It's better this way.

44:43.223 --> 44:46.017
Hey. I got something.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.706
Ah, nothing but dreck.

45:13.002 --> 45:15.213
Murrayleh...

45:17.048 --> 45:20.176
They think I am incapable.

45:20.176 --> 45:21.678
Old.

45:24.097 --> 45:27.600
You know how I know I'm not old?

45:29.853 --> 45:32.397
Because I was
supposed to grow old

45:32.397 --> 45:34.315
with you.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.117
Hello?

45:50.165 --> 45:52.417
<i>Momentito, momentito.</i>

46:07.682 --> 46:08.975
Hola.

46:08.975 --> 46:11.394
Oh, gracias.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.480
Come on, come on.

46:46.179 --> 46:48.264
For fuck's sake.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.312
Fuck off.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.483
Jesus Christ.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.568
Let me explain.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.612
- Just give me a minute,
I'll explain everything.
- No. No, why?

47:02.612 --> 47:05.615
Why-why should I listen
to you, Jonah?

47:05.615 --> 47:07.867
Everything you've
ever said is a lie.

47:07.867 --> 47:08.868
You want to know the truth?

47:08.868 --> 47:10.954
Yeah.

47:10.954 --> 47:13.748
Three years ago, I woke up
in the middle of the night

47:13.748 --> 47:15.375
to see a man murder
my grandmother.

47:15.375 --> 47:18.419
She bled out in my arms. I found
out later that she died because

47:18.419 --> 47:21.256
she spent the last year
hunting Nazi war criminals.

47:21.256 --> 47:24.217
This five-foot-nothing,
little old lady was killed

47:24.217 --> 47:26.511
by the very Nazi
she was hunting, so I...

47:26.511 --> 47:28.888
took her place after she died.

47:28.888 --> 47:31.432
I found the man who killed her
and then I found dozens more.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.268
Why the late nights,

47:33.268 --> 47:34.769
why the screams in my sleep,

47:34.769 --> 47:36.688
the-the name change,
it's because of this.

47:36.688 --> 47:39.399
It's because it never ends, and
I'm out here trying to end it,

47:39.399 --> 47:41.943
once and for all,
so I can have a life with you,

47:41.943 --> 47:43.403
- with the woman that I love.
- No.

47:44.404 --> 47:46.322
- Down! Down!
- What the fuck?

47:46.322 --> 47:48.324
- Jonah.
- Listen, when I say
go to the bathroom, all right,

47:48.324 --> 47:49.659
- you're gonna go. Go, go, go!
- What the fuck?

47:49.659 --> 47:51.035
- Jonah!
- Hide and don't come out.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.372
Jonah.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.293
Come on out, Jonah.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.924
Jonah.

48:06.593 --> 48:08.219
Jonah.

48:10.972 --> 48:12.557
Hey, Jonah.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.603
Jonah.

48:23.526 --> 48:25.320
Jonah!

48:26.738 --> 48:28.197
Jonah.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.035
Jonah!

48:44.839 --> 48:46.090
Come and get me!

48:48.092 --> 48:50.845
Move! Move! Get out of the way.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.310
Move!

50:28.568 --> 50:31.612
Look, I'm sorry about before.

50:34.699 --> 50:39.454
I think the... I think
the problem might be that I'm...

50:39.454 --> 50:42.290
You know, I'm still
in love with you.

50:42.290 --> 50:45.418
Wait until you're sober.

50:45.418 --> 50:48.171
Look, I can clean my shit up.
You know I can do that.

50:48.171 --> 50:50.715
- We are just not a good fit.
- How can you say that?

50:50.715 --> 50:52.425
Because I can't take care
of you anymore.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.385
It is a full-time job,

50:54.385 --> 50:57.430
and I have a child
already, Lonny.

50:57.430 --> 50:59.182
And I don't have
any more to give.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.746
Joe.

51:23.956 --> 51:27.251
Joe. Joe.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.968
Joe. Joe.

51:46.854 --> 51:49.023
<i>Policía. Policía.</i>

52:08.334 --> 52:10.002
No! Let me go!

52:10.002 --> 52:12.421
- Let me go!
- Clara!

52:19.720 --> 52:22.515
Clara!

52:24.350 --> 52:25.852
Clara!

52:27.144 --> 52:28.437
Clara!

52:31.232 --> 52:33.317
Clara!

52:33.317 --> 52:35.695
Sam!
