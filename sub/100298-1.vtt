09:52.217 --> 09:54.094

dinner together on Sundays?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.428

09:59.265 --> 10:01.726
Uh, people in

coming in more often.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.980
Ah, charity.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.441

We're one of maybe 100
cases he's handling...

10:25.834 --> 10:27.293
But that means he has
a lot of experience

10:27.293 --> 10:29.504

‐Javier: Yes.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.841

‐Really? He's hopeful?
He said that?

10:32.841 --> 10:36.594

only get reversed
8% of the time.

‐I looked it up.
‐Emilio: Luce...

10:38.096 --> 10:40.390

And it works against us
that Emilio is DACA

10:40.390 --> 10:42.058
because, technically, he's
old enough to take care of us.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.435

his status will hold.
