WEBVTT

00:18.560 --> 00:20.175
General Zaragoza!

00:21.850 --> 00:23.636
The French are retreating!

00:23.730 --> 00:25.686
Send the cavalry!

00:31.650 --> 00:33.948
After them! Fire the artillery!

00:39.780 --> 00:41.281
Bring the prisoner forward.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.610
You go that way, I'll go this way.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.097
Stop right there!
Get up and start walking!

01:06.190 --> 01:08.727
-Get up and walk!
-Just a second.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.357
Enough! Walk!

01:16.700 --> 01:18.019
Downstairs!

01:26.290 --> 01:28.030
On your knees.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.622
You're a spy for the enemy.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.205
Say your line.

01:33.210 --> 01:34.586
"Long live France!"

01:37.130 --> 01:39.837
The hero killed her with one shot!

01:45.640 --> 01:49.224
Will they be angry?
It's Mama's favorite rug.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.313
If they ask questions,
I'll do the talking.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.901
The gentleman will see you now.

04:22.420 --> 04:25.583
I wanted to congratulate you
on your brother's nomination.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.927
He's going to make a fine president.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.341
We're very proud.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.345
It's time for...

04:34.480 --> 04:36.345
a younger generation in Los Pinos, right?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.680
Exactly.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.982
From what I've read,
your brother seems like a smart man.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.105
He's brilliant.

04:45.070 --> 04:47.152
Whereas I'm simply... clever.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.404
Come on... "clever" usually pays better.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.821
You're in the hotel industry, correct?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.414
Yes, but I have other businesses as well.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.292
Import, export...

05:07.090 --> 05:08.580
You've done well for yourself.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.130
Can't complain.

05:11.350 --> 05:13.420
I've worked hard.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.683
Yes. Hard work. Always the cornerstone.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.318
Bet you come across a lot of pretty girls
in the hotel business.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.851
You have tennis courts at your properties?

05:25.610 --> 05:29.614
Yeah, one or two of them.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.570
Why?

05:33.660 --> 05:37.289
I've always enjoyed the sight of a woman
in a tennis skirt,

05:37.370 --> 05:39.622
with those white shoes they wear.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.626
I'd like to invite you...

05:47.430 --> 05:49.671
to spend some time at my hotel

05:50.140 --> 05:52.347
and be my guest of honor.
What do you think?

05:53.720 --> 05:57.304
We could arrange a tennis match for you,
I'm sure.

05:57.770 --> 05:59.306
I don't care much for Guadalajara.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.469
Prefer the beach.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.607
I have properties all over.

06:06.070 --> 06:07.606
Whatever you'd like.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.986
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about...

06:13.790 --> 06:15.405
all the things I can offer you.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.861
I'd... I'd like the opportunity to help...

06:19.580 --> 06:22.037
you and... your brother, obviously.

06:22.670 --> 06:23.830
You donate to the party?

06:23.920 --> 06:26.252
Of course, every chance I get.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.336
Then you've already helped immeasurably.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.001
My brother's going to do great things
for this country.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.798
I came to propose a relationship.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.801
A more "direct" one.

06:46.190 --> 06:48.272
I can be an asset...

06:49.610 --> 06:51.191
to you and your brother.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.737
Not only professionally, but...

06:54.240 --> 06:57.494
personally, a friendship.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.821
I'm someone who believes in that.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.872
Who doesn't need a friend, right?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.336
A discreet friend.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.171
And more importantly...

07:12.470 --> 07:13.960
a generous one.

07:17.430 --> 07:20.433
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but we're not in need of all that.

07:22.440 --> 07:26.513
I can't be certain what the future holds
for the "hotel business"...

07:27.730 --> 07:30.483
but I can tell you one thing
about my brother and I.

07:30.570 --> 07:32.106
We value family...

07:32.820 --> 07:34.151
and loyalty.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.611
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra
has been a loyal friend to our family

07:37.700 --> 07:39.941
since my brother and I were boys.

07:41.750 --> 07:42.956
I'm aware of that.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.876
I've heard that story before.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.875
And I'm...

07:50.670 --> 07:51.796
I'm not going to lie.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.548
I've had disagreements with Don Juan.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.052
Well, I hope your issues
can be resolved amicably.

07:58.810 --> 08:02.439
Because if anything were to happen to
Sear
Guerra, my brother and I would be...

08:03.900 --> 08:05.344
very upset.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.312
Juan is quite a... character.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.810
What I can tell you is that...

08:14.910 --> 08:17.652
my brother's going to be
everybody's president.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.865
We look forward to your vote.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.500
What kind of fuck/77g pol/ﬁaan
doesn ’1' want money?

08:36.590 --> 08:38.751
You're sure he speaks for his brother?

08:38.850 --> 08:39.669
Always.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.671
They're a team, hammer and nail.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.262
-I've heard things. He's a player.
-A player?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.970
A player would take the money.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.062
-Why the fuck doesn't he want my money?
-No idea.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.141
Find out what's going on.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.942
I want every fucking detail.

08:57.990 --> 08:58.979
And Guerra?

09:01.620 --> 09:03.247
Can't touch him.

09:04.910 --> 09:08.914
But the old goat can take another shot
at you any time he likes.

09:10.340 --> 09:11.455
I know.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.410
I'm going to Sinaloa.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.420
Safer than Guadalajara.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.296
Motherfuckers.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.933
Got more on that "situation"
between Tijuana and Sinaloa.

09:26.690 --> 09:29.147
Now what? They're still at it?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.317
We told them no more bullshit violence.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.029
But I'm not sure the boys
were really listening.

09:44.290 --> 09:47.532
Alter Chapo ’5 thing,
’Mon went after Cochi’s favorite mariachi.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.997
Hey, asshole. Get down.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.666
Please, mister, I'm begging you.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.162
Grab his good hand.
You know "Cielito Lindo," man?

09:58.340 --> 09:59.420
And Cochiloco...

10:00.220 --> 10:01.926
he o’ia'n ’t appreciate that.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.107
Hey, hose that shit off.

10:17.860 --> 10:19.987
Call Benjamn and Palma.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.230
It stops now.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.403
Settle on a number for the taxes
they ducked, that ends it.

10:24.870 --> 10:27.407
Let me know as soon as you find out
something on the brothers.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.569
Let's go, Clavel.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.791
E| Padrino's feeling the pressure.

14:34.410 --> 14:35.695
Hey, boss.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.570
Good to be back home in Sinaloa?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.539
When are you coming home?

14:52.640 --> 14:57.339
I'm not sure. Have some business
I need to handle here.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.260
Is everything okay?

14:59.350 --> 15:02.934
Yeah. I just need to ﬁgure
some things out.

15:05.150 --> 15:07.027
Hang on, I can put the baby on the phone.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.442
No, no, no. Maybe later.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.355
I'm a little busy right now.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.945
I'll call you later.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.881
I didn't expect to see you again.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.056
But here I am.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.059
And with such lovely company.

15:42.310 --> 15:46.019
Thought it was a good idea for all of us
to meet. We need more.

15:48.940 --> 15:51.101
At least 700 kilos this time.

15:52.070 --> 15:54.152
Business must be good.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.903
We've been saving our allowances.
Right, doll?

16:00.580 --> 16:01.706
Give me two weeks.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.952
I hear things are changing in Mexico.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.836
"Changing" how?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.297
Cali's going to start moving product
through the Gulf

16:14.390 --> 16:16.130
with Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

16:16.220 --> 16:20.133
But I don't see why that should
change our arrangement.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.096
Going forward...

16:24.190 --> 16:28.968
maybe we can make this
an exclusive relationship.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.029
Knock ten percent off every load
over 400 kilos,

16:36.120 --> 16:38.520
you're the only supplier
we do business with.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.202
Flix has competition now. He's weak.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.281
We need to push harder.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.666
It's time to expand.

17:03.390 --> 17:07.599
Every time I sit down with him,
I feel like I need to wash my hands.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.957
WHO WILL YOU PICK IN THIS ELECTION?
ON JULY 6TH JUREZ NEEDS YOUR VOTE

18:07.410 --> 18:09.412
All right got it.

18:13.340 --> 18:15.331
Indian motherfucker.

18:24.140 --> 18:25.550
Listen up!

18:27.770 --> 18:29.089
I spoke to Azul.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.808
Says this shit with Tijuana has to stop.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.278
Hey... I mean it, man.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.486
Come on, Chapo.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.232
Damn it, man. Fuck those pussies.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.242
Flix says it's over. So it's over.

18:46.330 --> 18:49.572
We have to negotiate a price.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.661
Kid's hurt, man. Look at him.

18:51.750 --> 18:55.914
Put his heart and soul
in that fucking tunnel.

18:56.380 --> 19:00.123
Your shit with the steamroller
didn't help.

19:00.630 --> 19:04.259
Ramn fucked with a musician, man.
That's like picking on a child.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.170
Fucking asshole.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.977
Okay, fuck it. I'll talk to them.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.568
At the end of the day, shit's just money.

19:16.610 --> 19:18.646
Go back and forth a little first.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.816
Just not too hard.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.277
For real, Cochi, don't mess with Ramn.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.407
Fuck him, with his shirts.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.868
I'll just talk with Benjamn
or the other one...

19:31.080 --> 19:32.536
Eduardo?

19:34.380 --> 19:35.529
Javier, the kid?

19:35.630 --> 19:37.291
The other one, with the mopey face.

19:37.380 --> 19:38.540
Francisco.

19:38.630 --> 19:41.679
Him, Francisco.
He loves me, I'll talk with him.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.920
Sounds good. See ya!

22:41.810 --> 22:44.222
Keep fucking walking, man. I mean it.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.771
Relax, 'Cisco. Fuck, man.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.566
I hate fucking clowns.

23:04.090 --> 23:05.489
What did the new doctor say?

23:07.710 --> 23:09.291
Wants to do more tests on her.

23:11.180 --> 23:13.000
There's some specialist up in San Diego.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.886
Ruth might take her. We'll see.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.136
God's going to protect her, man.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.350
I've been praying every night.

23:26.650 --> 23:27.560
Thanks, 'Mon.

23:51.930 --> 23:52.794
Hey, Benjamn.

23:54.140 --> 23:57.462
You remember Ivan?
He works down at the nightclub. Security.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.010
Sure.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.478
He's got something you want to hear.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.391
Go on. Tell my brother what you told me.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.799
Hold up.

24:15.070 --> 24:16.697
Hey, man. Take a walk, okay?

24:16.780 --> 24:18.020
Benjamn. Come on.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.191
He doesn't mind, right? Or do you?

24:22.160 --> 24:23.206
Nah, man.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.166
It's cool.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.625
What the fuck, man?

24:33.130 --> 24:35.462
David's cool.
I know him, man. I trust him.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.880
Who the fuck is he?

24:42.390 --> 24:44.221
Some fucking American you met in prison?

24:44.310 --> 24:45.516
Gave you cigarettes?

24:46.310 --> 24:49.473
Doesn't mean I trust him.
Use your fucking brain, man.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.440
What is it?

24:55.700 --> 24:56.906
Sorry.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.616
My cousin's a cop, right?

25:01.660 --> 25:03.901
State police, in Guadalajara.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.949
So we get to talking, tells me about
how last week a call came in.

25:09.790 --> 25:13.544
Gunshots. In this nice neighborhood.
Fancy.

25:13.630 --> 25:16.372
When he shows up,
there's a couple of cars.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.677
One's all shot up.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.513
But whoever was inside... long gone.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.051
The other car was bodyguards.

25:26.140 --> 25:29.439
They tell my cousin it's been handled.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.733
Put some money in his hand.
"Fuck off," basically.

25:35.610 --> 25:37.350
But this car that's been all shot up?

25:39.530 --> 25:41.532
My cousin's seen it around town.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.496
He recognizes it.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.242
He knows who the target was.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.756
What did you ﬁnd out?

25:53.840 --> 25:55.410
Dio’ some digging.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.337
I know why they aren ’1‘ interested
in your money.

25:59.180 --> 26:02.968
He and his brother are about to make
a bunch of their friends rich.

26:04.180 --> 26:08.219
OIZ steel and ra/iroads rich.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.300
What the fuck are you talking about?

26:11.860 --> 26:16.399
I’m talking about his plans
for the economy.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.641
So why don ’t they want your money?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.277
’Cause they don ’t fucking need it.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.521
The brothers have cut deals
that will make them millions.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.367
Bad news for your relationship
with the party.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.609
What’s lei? of it.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.326
Fuck!

31:57.990 --> 31:59.491
Thanks, man.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.002
Yes, Benjamn. What is it?

32:09.460 --> 32:12.008
I need to talk to you about this shit
with Sinaloa.

32:13.510 --> 32:15.046
I’ve already hand/ed it.

32:15.140 --> 32:17.597
-Told them to make it right.
-Yeah, I know.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.138
Coch/ioco’s on his way up here to
offer us money, make this a// go away.

32:21.230 --> 32:24.347
Then what's the problem?
They're going to make peace.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.819
The prob/em is the Are/iano F/iX fam/iy
km ’1' interested in peace anymore.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.312
We ’re interested in sending a message.

32:30.900 --> 32:31.946
7'o eye/yone.

32:33.990 --> 32:38.575
Benjamn, you're upset.
You need to be an adult about this.

32:38.660 --> 32:39.900
They stole from us.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.497
And now they're going to pay you back.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.416
Thats not good enough.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.164
Look, I'll make that decision.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.625
I’ve already made it; for myse/ﬁ

32:53.800 --> 32:56.587
Maybe you should start thinking about what
the Guadalajara Cartel would look like

32:56.680 --> 32:58.136
if Tijuana pulled out.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.723
That will never happen.
Don't even think it.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.722
This fighting between your plazas
makes you look weak.

33:09.110 --> 33:12.432
I know someone took a run at you
last week in Guadalajara.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.640
Shot up your car.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.112
And that makes you look even weaker.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.247
I don ’t think you want to answer
the questions

33:22.330 --> 33:24.821
that losing my organization would raise.

33:28.130 --> 33:32.203
Keeping my family happy
should be very important to you right now.

33:34.670 --> 33:35.716
Yeah.

33:37.050 --> 33:39.427
What did you have in mind?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.485
What are you doing?

35:20.570 --> 35:22.117
I was going in with you.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.526
Why?

35:26.740 --> 35:27.786
Fuck, no.

35:28.450 --> 35:29.906
Stay with the car.

35:38.090 --> 35:40.297
This is what came in from Badiraguato--

35:42.220 --> 35:43.289
Boss.

35:43.800 --> 35:44.926
Get out, Miguelito.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.221
When'd you get here?

35:50.690 --> 35:51.839
How are you, Gerito?

35:52.650 --> 35:53.935
We need to talk.

35:58.110 --> 36:02.069
Afternoon, Mrs. Palma.
Boss is in there with him.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.778
I'll just drop this for him in the shop.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.651
Please give this to Mr. Palma
when you get a chance.

36:11.330 --> 36:12.365
Thanks.

36:14.830 --> 36:16.411
You can call me Guadalupe.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.199
Very well.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.508
I'm keeping an eye on things out here.
Basically in charge of security.

36:23.470 --> 36:24.755
You're not from Mexico.

36:25.340 --> 36:26.967
Venezuela.

36:31.810 --> 36:33.687
Well, I hope you enjoy Sinaloa.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.897
So far I like what I've seen of it.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.481
Well, goodbye.

36:41.900 --> 36:42.980
Goodbye.

39:10.050 --> 39:13.542
Look, I know things got carried away
with Tijuana.

39:16.390 --> 39:17.425
But...

39:17.850 --> 39:20.136
we're gonna pay Benjamn.

39:20.940 --> 39:22.180
I promise.

39:24.360 --> 39:28.979
Cochi’s on his way r/ght now
to talk to him, make it right.

39:30.530 --> 39:33.909
I know Cochi’s been sent to handle it.

39:33.990 --> 39:35.070
Yeah.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.207
But he's not coming back from Tijuana.

39:40.960 --> 39:41.779
What?

39:57.890 --> 40:01.098
Cochi's been in the game
as long as anyone.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.896
They can't just...

40:07.730 --> 40:08.970
Miguel ngel, please.

40:09.820 --> 40:12.106
This doesn't have to happen.

40:12.570 --> 40:14.697
But it is happening, Gerito.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.196
We were just fucking around.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.111
Trying to make money, you know?

40:19.200 --> 40:22.704
We got caught,
so now we'll just pay the tax.

40:24.210 --> 40:26.531
It was just fucking around.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.871
This is what we do.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.711
We're not fucking accountants, man.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.085
We're not cowboys either.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.922
Things are different now, Gero.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.055
Flix...

40:42.020 --> 40:44.261
Cochi's one of the plaza's top guys.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.266
We...

40:46.810 --> 40:49.142
do not kill each other over bullshit.

40:49.230 --> 40:50.356
Over fucking money?

40:51.150 --> 40:53.141
Cochi's one of us, Flix!

40:54.570 --> 40:55.867
Doesn't that mean something?

41:11.510 --> 41:13.831
How long have you known him?

41:15.930 --> 41:17.249
About 20 years.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.887
Since I was a cop.

41:19.970 --> 41:22.052
Twenty fucking years.

41:24.890 --> 41:25.891
And now...

41:26.350 --> 41:29.899
just because those pussies in Tijuana
get their fucking feelings hurt--

41:29.980 --> 41:31.561
No, Gero!

41:33.820 --> 41:36.106
Because you can't control your plaza.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.401
You can't control your men.

41:42.330 --> 41:43.945
You don't have the balls...

41:44.620 --> 41:45.826
to be the boss.

41:47.580 --> 41:49.741
Because you're weak, Gerito.

41:55.670 --> 41:56.796
Okay.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.340
You're right.

42:01.970 --> 42:04.382
But please don't do this, Miguel ngel.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.180
Call Benjamn...

42:08.900 --> 42:10.640
and stop it.

42:40.970 --> 42:41.959
Let's go.

42:51.650 --> 42:52.810
It's done.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.146
I came here...

42:56.940 --> 42:59.192
so you'd hear it from me.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.336
Going back to the house, boss?

43:28.480 --> 43:29.799
Give me the keys.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.685
I'm driving myself.

44:01.010 --> 44:03.296
No, no, no. No snacks before dinner.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.709
But I'm hungry.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.507
After your homework. Go on.
Tell your brother, too.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.010
They never stop eating.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.224
Papa.

44:19.820 --> 44:21.105
Want your coffee?

44:23.360 --> 44:24.361
Papa.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.325
Papa?

44:32.290 --> 44:34.781
-What is it?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

44:35.330 --> 44:37.082
What are you looking at, then?

44:49.260 --> 44:53.594
I said yes, now I'm not playing.
Come here! Come here!

44:55.060 --> 44:56.220
Give her back!

44:56.860 --> 44:58.225
Come here, boy!

45:10.080 --> 45:12.287
What the fuck do you think
you're doing out here?

45:13.660 --> 45:14.820
Hello, Mara.

45:15.370 --> 45:17.031
What are you doing, Miguel?

45:21.920 --> 45:22.966
I'm sorry...

45:24.340 --> 45:28.959
to show up like this.

45:33.100 --> 45:35.432
I've been thinking about you.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.227
I don't care what you've
been "thinking" about.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.349
Yeah.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.890
Things are fucked up right now.

45:45.530 --> 45:46.736
You don't need me.

45:49.870 --> 45:51.155
Remember?

45:52.910 --> 45:54.537
I haven't forgotten.

45:55.410 --> 45:56.957
And I don't need you.

45:57.960 --> 45:59.416
None of us do.

45:59.500 --> 46:03.413
You're like... you're like a disease,
Miguel, look at you.

46:06.300 --> 46:09.337
I don't want you near me. Or my children.
You hear me?

46:09.850 --> 46:11.169
Understand?

46:11.260 --> 46:14.844
So no more showing up here.
No more following the kids to school.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.305
You aren't wanted.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.890
You're not welcome here.

46:20.730 --> 46:23.563
So get the fuck off my property,
and don't come back.

50:42.370 --> 50:49.117
History shows us that political errors

50:49.540 --> 50:52.031
are always paid for.

50:52.130 --> 50:55.258
The people and history...

50:56.420 --> 50:59.378
are not forgiving.

51:02.680 --> 51:08.550
Those who have betrayed the people
of Mexico will soon face justice!

51:08.640 --> 51:12.428
They will be called to account
for their sins.

51:13.270 --> 51:15.431
A new day is coming.

51:16.110 --> 51:18.487
Some will be punished,

51:18.570 --> 51:21.027
and others will be rewarded!

51:38.260 --> 51:40.581
Mommy, he's doing it again.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.171
Hctor, stop bothering your sister
and eat.

51:43.260 --> 51:44.545
I'm not doing anything!

51:46.770 --> 51:48.385
Is everything okay?

51:50.230 --> 51:52.095
You haven't touched your dinner.

51:57.230 --> 51:59.107
Hctor, what's wrong?

51:59.190 --> 52:02.159
Nothing. Leave it alone, babe. Okay?
