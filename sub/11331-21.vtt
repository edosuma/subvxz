00:00.079 --> 00:02.912
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.945 --> 00:04.780
- Grandma?
- Who are you?

00:04.814 --> 00:05.848
I'm Grace's...

00:06.817 --> 00:07.750
fiancÃ©.

00:08.719 --> 00:09.818
And the thing is,

00:09.853 --> 00:11.821
I'm in the finals for the spelling bee.

00:11.855 --> 00:13.856
And I thought maybe you could tell
me what it's like to go to State.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.525
You're really going to get married?
Amy said that she'd marry you for real?

00:16.560 --> 00:17.593
- Yeah.
- Wait.

00:17.627 --> 00:19.462
Why isn't she telling me this?

00:19.496 --> 00:21.597
So I guess that if you're getting
married the day after we graduate then...

00:21.631 --> 00:24.400
You must be planning to go
to summer school in New York.

00:25.502 --> 00:27.369
You wanted to see me?

00:27.404 --> 00:29.405
Yeah, she thinks you were cheating.

00:29.439 --> 00:32.141
And it was the teacher
that ratted you out, not me.

00:32.174 --> 00:34.977
Amy's going to school in New York,
I'm going to school in New York,

00:35.011 --> 00:37.813
and we're going to end
up living together. Wow.

00:37.848 --> 00:40.049
You can stop pretending
you need a spelling partner.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.817
If you want some help, I'll help you.

00:41.852 --> 00:43.586
I'll give you a hint.

00:43.620 --> 00:44.587
She's my mother.

00:44.621 --> 00:45.688
Grandma?

00:45.722 --> 00:47.790
I am not ready to get
pregnant and start a family.

00:48.825 --> 00:50.726
All right.

00:50.761 --> 00:54.263
And Kathleen... do you take
George to be your wedded husband?

00:54.297 --> 00:55.397
I do.

00:59.469 --> 01:03.038
Well, that was depressing.

01:03.073 --> 01:04.173
It was a funeral, Tom.

01:04.206 --> 01:05.808
It's not supposed to be fun.

01:05.876 --> 01:10.946
Yeah, well, I'm glad Grandma
wasn't there to see it.

01:10.981 --> 01:12.014
No one came.

01:12.048 --> 01:14.016
She didn't live here, Tom,

01:14.050 --> 01:15.751
and I'm sure she didn't
have a lot of friends.

01:15.786 --> 01:16.719
I'm sure.

01:18.455 --> 01:20.322
Your mother just lost her mother. Be nice.

01:20.357 --> 01:21.590
Sorry, Mom.

01:21.625 --> 01:26.495
I just thought she should
have been nicer to you.

01:28.165 --> 01:29.198
Thank you, Tom.

01:33.203 --> 01:34.203
Are you okay?

01:35.105 --> 01:36.372
Yeah, I am.

01:36.406 --> 01:38.140
I'm okay.

01:38.175 --> 01:41.710
I wish she and I had
talked years ago, but...

01:41.745 --> 01:43.078
But that's not really your fault.

01:43.113 --> 01:45.815
You didn't know what was going
on with her or how she felt.

01:45.849 --> 01:47.950
At least she got a chance
to tell you before she left.

01:47.984 --> 01:49.718
Yeah, at least.

01:49.753 --> 01:50.886
I'm happy she got to come to our wedding.

01:50.921 --> 01:52.555
I know. Me, too.

01:52.589 --> 01:53.522
And my mother.

01:54.457 --> 01:55.391
Yeah.

01:58.295 --> 02:00.095
I'm going to go upstairs.

02:00.130 --> 02:01.230
Okay. Do you want me to come
up there for a while with you?

02:01.264 --> 02:03.465
Uh, no, no, no, I just
need some time alone.

02:05.068 --> 02:06.068
Uh...

02:06.102 --> 02:07.236
is your mother coming over?

02:07.270 --> 02:09.003
I told her you needed some time alone.

02:09.038 --> 02:11.173
Not that that will stop her.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.876
I'm going to ask her to
go, it's time for her to go.

02:13.910 --> 02:14.910
And she can always come back.

02:14.945 --> 02:16.111
Not like your mother.

02:17.948 --> 02:19.682
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive.

02:19.716 --> 02:20.850
It's okay.

02:20.884 --> 02:22.651
But if you could,

02:22.686 --> 02:24.720
I'd just really like to
hang out in my kitchen.

02:26.756 --> 02:28.324
Our kitchen.

02:29.459 --> 02:30.526
Have my house to myself.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.694
If she comes, I'll get rid of her.

02:31.728 --> 02:33.229
She can go over to Amy's or something.

02:33.263 --> 02:35.397
Or she could go to the restaurant with you.

02:35.432 --> 02:37.099
Or over to Amy's or something.

02:38.335 --> 02:41.437
What can I do for you, Grace?
How can I make this easier?

02:41.471 --> 02:44.240
I don't think burying a
grandparent is supposed to be easy.

02:44.274 --> 02:46.876
So I just need time to mourn.

02:47.811 --> 02:48.978
More time to mourn.

02:49.012 --> 02:50.779
Yeah. Take all the time you need.

02:52.082 --> 02:53.582
I need to do it alone.

02:53.617 --> 02:55.818
You don't have to do it alone, Grace.

02:55.886 --> 02:58.654
I'm going to be here for you,
like you've been here for me.

02:58.688 --> 03:01.290
Yeah, the thing is, I'd
like to be here by myself,

03:01.324 --> 03:02.324
if you don't mind.

03:02.359 --> 03:03.359
So you want me to go home?

03:03.393 --> 03:05.327
You can go wherever you want, Jack.

03:05.362 --> 03:07.363
I just really want to be here by myself

03:07.397 --> 03:09.365
and remember my grandmother
and all that she meant to me.

03:09.399 --> 03:11.100
I thought you didn't
like her all that much.

03:11.134 --> 03:13.369
No, I love her.

03:13.403 --> 03:15.137
I love that she came
here and apologized to us

03:15.171 --> 03:17.072
and let us have one good memory of her.

03:17.107 --> 03:19.141
It's just so much better than if
we just heard that she passed away

03:19.175 --> 03:20.175
and never saw her again.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.710
Yeah. The good die young.

03:21.745 --> 03:24.013
Well, she was hardly young, Jack.

03:24.047 --> 03:25.681
Or good. Until the end.

03:25.715 --> 03:27.549
Well, she's in a better place now.

03:27.584 --> 03:28.918
Six feet under is a better place?

03:28.952 --> 03:31.520
It was a really nice
plot, Grace, she's lucky.

03:31.554 --> 03:32.588
I really have to be alone.

03:34.691 --> 03:37.693
Okay. Then, I guess death will do us part.

03:39.329 --> 03:41.263
Can you go, please, Jack?

03:41.298 --> 03:43.332
All right, Mrs. Pappas. I'll be back later.

03:43.366 --> 03:45.467
Not tonight, okay? I just need time.

03:45.502 --> 03:47.169
- I love you, Grace.
- I love you.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.909
Okay, bye.

03:53.944 --> 03:54.944
Bye.

04:01.051 --> 04:02.584
God, what have I done?

04:19.601 --> 04:22.538
Okay, we'll set up a buffet, right?

04:22.572 --> 04:24.707
And we're gonna try one of everything.

04:24.741 --> 04:26.575
See if we like this Thai restaurant.

04:26.609 --> 04:27.609
It's got to be better than...

04:27.644 --> 04:28.811
Oh!

04:28.845 --> 04:30.713
Hi, Nora. I wondered where you were.

04:30.747 --> 04:33.615
- I didn't see your car.
- I'm parked right out there in front of the house.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.884
So, are you moving things out?

04:35.919 --> 04:38.654
Yes. I'm moving everything
I want out of the house,

04:38.688 --> 04:41.890
and I asked George and Amy and Ashley

04:41.925 --> 04:43.726
to move everything they
want out of the house.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.027
So I guess you want me out of the house.

04:45.061 --> 04:47.663
I guess I do.

04:47.697 --> 04:48.931
You couldn't have called me to tell me

04:48.965 --> 04:50.766
that George and Kathleen got married?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.534
There are so many people you know

04:52.569 --> 04:54.937
that are closer to you than I am.

04:54.971 --> 04:57.773
George, for example. Amy. Even Ricky.

04:57.807 --> 04:59.875
So did George just move in with Kathleen?

04:59.909 --> 05:00.976
Kind of, I guess.

05:01.011 --> 05:03.512
It all happened pretty quickly.

05:03.546 --> 05:04.813
I guess I have to put
the house up for sale.

05:04.848 --> 05:06.715
Or not.

05:06.750 --> 05:10.586
I guess you could keep the house if
you want. I mean, it's your house.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.588
Maybe you and your mother
and Robie could live here.

05:12.622 --> 05:13.956
No, I can't live here.

05:13.990 --> 05:17.593
I can't take care of my mother every day.

05:17.627 --> 05:20.562
Ugh! I just don't want
to let go of this place.

05:20.597 --> 05:21.964
I know it's ridiculous to hang onto it,

05:21.998 --> 05:24.733
you know, with the market coming up and...

05:24.768 --> 05:26.535
I don't know.

05:26.569 --> 05:29.838
Well, I could offer to rent it,

05:29.873 --> 05:31.640
but I'm sure it's way
out of my price range.

05:31.674 --> 05:34.643
George and I lived here
for almost 20 years.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.712
We raised a family here.

05:36.746 --> 05:38.914
And now I guess he's just going
to go back to his first wife

05:38.948 --> 05:40.883
and forget all about the
life that we had together.

05:40.917 --> 05:41.984
I guess.

05:43.987 --> 05:45.954
Have you forgotten that you're...

05:45.989 --> 05:47.623
It would have been nice if they
had invited me to the wedding.

05:47.657 --> 05:48.991
Yes, it would have been really nice.

05:52.695 --> 05:54.830
Amy!

05:54.864 --> 05:58.901
Um, I'm just going to let
you talk to your mother.

05:58.935 --> 06:00.803
Come on, Moose, we're
gonna eat in bed tonight.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.677
Mom, did you really need
me to come over right now?

06:08.711 --> 06:10.913
I'm busy, I have homework and a test and...

06:10.947 --> 06:14.683
I mean, what, do you really
want me to move all my stuff out?

06:15.552 --> 06:16.885
I don't know, Amy,

06:16.920 --> 06:19.555
I just felt like seeing you.

06:19.589 --> 06:22.658
I felt like seeing my daughter
in my house one more time.

06:22.692 --> 06:23.826
Isn't that a little dramatic?

06:23.860 --> 06:27.729
Yes. But, I don't know,

06:27.764 --> 06:29.631
I'm still kind of surprised
that your dad and Kathleen

06:29.666 --> 06:31.633
got married without telling me.

06:31.668 --> 06:34.903
I know that I'll never be with
your dad again, but still...

06:34.938 --> 06:36.638
But still what?

06:36.673 --> 06:37.773
But still you're gay?

06:37.807 --> 06:41.009
Yeah, I don't know. Yes. Yes, I am gay.

06:41.044 --> 06:43.946
And I'm happy that I finally
came to terms with that.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.849
And it's been a really great
time discovering who I am

06:46.883 --> 06:48.984
and what I want to,

06:49.018 --> 06:51.954
but still, your dad and I were married

06:51.988 --> 06:53.889
and we had a family.

06:53.923 --> 06:54.957
Now we're not and we don't.

06:54.991 --> 06:56.892
Oh, come on.

06:56.926 --> 06:59.795
Last time I checked, you were
still my mother. I'm your family.

06:59.829 --> 07:02.498
- Yeah, I know, but...
- But what?

07:02.532 --> 07:04.933
You and Ricky, you're still getting
married the day after you graduate, right?

07:04.968 --> 07:06.902
- Yeah.
- I just thought of something.

07:06.936 --> 07:09.571
No, Mom. We're doing the wedding ourselves.

07:09.606 --> 07:10.706
It won't cost anyone anything.

07:10.740 --> 07:12.641
What if after you and Ricky get married,

07:12.675 --> 07:15.677
you move out of that little
apartment into this house?

07:15.712 --> 07:17.813
The three of you, and Nora if you want.

07:17.847 --> 07:19.548
Just stay here as long
as you want the house.

07:19.582 --> 07:21.583
I don't know, Mom.

07:21.618 --> 07:23.719
I don't... I don't know if we want a house.

07:23.753 --> 07:26.889
Or if we can handle a
house. I mean, it's a house.

07:26.923 --> 07:29.958
I'm just getting out of high
school and I'm getting married

07:29.993 --> 07:31.527
and going to college.

07:31.561 --> 07:32.995
That's a lot as it is.

07:33.029 --> 07:34.830
Even maybe too much.

07:34.864 --> 07:40.669
I don't know if we, uh,
want to take over this house.

07:40.703 --> 07:41.803
Forgot something.

07:41.838 --> 07:43.739
Need a couple of plates.

07:43.773 --> 07:44.873
Think about it, Amy.

07:44.908 --> 07:47.009
You and Ricky would have
so much more room here,

07:47.043 --> 07:49.878
and Nora could be here to help babysit

07:49.913 --> 07:51.580
and John could have a yard.

07:51.614 --> 07:52.714
You wouldn't have to go to the park!

07:52.749 --> 07:54.449
You loved growing up here

07:54.517 --> 07:55.617
and John would love growing up here.

07:55.652 --> 07:57.319
He already loves it here.

07:57.353 --> 07:58.620
Nora, would you like to stay here

07:58.655 --> 08:00.289
if Amy and Ricky and John moved in here?

08:01.658 --> 08:03.325
Mom, we need to talk about this.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.160
Yeah, you two talk.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.365
Mom, I want to go to school in New York.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.901
I'm going to school in New York.

08:12.936 --> 08:14.002
I haven't quite made
that clear to Ricky yet,

08:14.037 --> 08:15.170
but I'm going to summer school.

08:15.205 --> 08:17.739
But you're getting married
the day after you graduate.

08:17.774 --> 08:20.842
Yeah, because that was the only way
that I could go to summer school.

08:20.877 --> 08:22.844
Look, I'm going to give
Ricky what he wants.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.012
We're getting married.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.914
But I also want to give me what I want.

08:25.949 --> 08:29.751
And I want to go to school in
New York, starting this summer.

08:29.786 --> 08:34.289
But, I mean, maybe Ricky
and his mom could live here

08:34.323 --> 08:37.558
while I live in New York
and go to school there.

08:37.594 --> 08:39.494
And, you know, it would
be really nice for Ricky

08:39.529 --> 08:42.297
to have her here to help him out.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.265
And then, when I come home to visit,

08:44.300 --> 08:47.135
I would be visiting our house
and that would be really nice.

08:49.205 --> 08:50.239
What do you think?

08:50.273 --> 08:53.041
I think you either get
married and stay here

08:53.076 --> 08:55.577
or you move to New York and go to school,

08:55.612 --> 08:57.713
but not both. It's one or the other.

08:57.747 --> 09:00.716
- Why?
- The two things do not go together.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.651
And it sounds to me like
you're only marrying Ricky

09:02.685 --> 09:03.652
because you don't want to tell him

09:03.686 --> 09:05.354
that you don't want to be married.

09:05.388 --> 09:07.589
You want to go to New York by
yourself and be a single mom.

09:07.624 --> 09:10.192
I don't know if I want to
take John with me to New York.

09:10.226 --> 09:15.163
I mean, it may be best for
him to be with Ricky, here.

09:15.198 --> 09:17.432
Either way, I'm still
going to have to get a job

09:17.467 --> 09:21.937
and I'm still not even going to be
able afford being a single mother

09:21.971 --> 09:23.238
and living New York and
going to school there.

09:23.273 --> 09:25.173
All right, I'll tell you what.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.908
Don't get married.

09:26.943 --> 09:28.810
I'll sell the house and
I'll give you the money

09:28.845 --> 09:30.078
so you can go to New York and
be a single mom and go to school.

09:30.113 --> 09:31.913
I already told Ricky that I'd marry him.

09:39.422 --> 09:40.489
Margaret has to have a computer.

09:40.523 --> 09:41.690
I know she does. She has a laptop.

09:41.724 --> 09:43.525
She wouldn't let me on it.

09:43.559 --> 09:44.626
And they wanted to go out and
they dumped me over here, okay?

09:44.661 --> 09:46.561
- Leave me alone.
- I have stuff to do, too!

09:48.298 --> 09:50.065
- Sit down.
- No!

09:50.099 --> 09:51.133
Then you're going to bed.

09:56.372 --> 09:59.241
- Hello?
- Amy is going to summer school in New York?

09:59.275 --> 10:01.076
- Where'd you hear that?
- From Amy.

10:01.110 --> 10:02.911
She's in the kitchen, talking to Anne.

10:02.945 --> 10:05.847
Anne offered to let you and Amy and John

10:05.882 --> 10:07.749
live in the house, and me, too!

10:07.784 --> 10:09.618
But Amy's apparently
going to summer school.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.453
No, she's not. I think I would know.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.355
- Would you?
- Mom, we're getting married.

10:13.389 --> 10:15.424
Why would she take off for New
York right after we get married?

10:15.458 --> 10:16.725
We're still trying to
figure everything out.

10:16.759 --> 10:19.261
We don't even know if she can
afford to go to that school.

10:19.295 --> 10:20.262
Never mind.

10:22.332 --> 10:24.499
Just do your homework so
I can do mine, all right?

10:24.534 --> 10:26.034
I don't think you're going to be able to

10:26.069 --> 10:27.135
get any homework done now.

10:27.170 --> 10:28.904
Shut up and focus!

10:30.873 --> 10:32.908
Okay, uh, if I can't get the
apartment and the dorm room,

10:32.942 --> 10:33.975
I'll take the apartment.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.944
I think it's best if you live in the dorm

10:35.978 --> 10:38.680
your first year of school,
get to know some new people.

10:38.715 --> 10:40.048
Some not-Amy people?

10:40.083 --> 10:41.750
You said it, not me.

10:41.784 --> 10:43.652
But yes, some not-Amy people.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.587
But I can get the apartment if I want?

10:45.621 --> 10:47.789
Yeah, you can make the decision
as to where you're gonna live

10:47.824 --> 10:51.259
from whatever choices
I've approved for you.

10:51.294 --> 10:53.228
Don't forget, I'm paying for it

10:53.262 --> 10:55.263
and you're going to be on a budget.

10:55.298 --> 10:57.399
You think you can get an
apartment cheaper than the dorms?

10:57.433 --> 11:01.069
Well, I've been looking and an
apartment might be slightly more.

11:01.104 --> 11:03.138
Couple of hundred a month
more, for something near campus.

11:03.172 --> 11:06.208
But it would be quieter
and probably safer and...

11:06.242 --> 11:08.076
Fine. Let's see what we can find.

11:08.111 --> 11:10.011
You look and I'll look.

11:10.046 --> 11:12.647
But don't come back to me with one
place that you just have to have

11:12.682 --> 11:14.549
that's twice what the dorms would be.

11:14.584 --> 11:15.650
And if Amy needs...

11:15.685 --> 11:18.687
Stop trying to find a
place that fits you and Amy!

11:18.721 --> 11:20.622
You're already giving them a
place to live on the West Coast,

11:20.656 --> 11:21.757
why not the East Coast, too?

11:21.791 --> 11:24.292
What on earth are you envisioning?

11:24.327 --> 11:27.396
That she's going to be his wife
here and your girlfriend there?

11:27.430 --> 11:29.431
I'm envisioning her not getting married,

11:29.465 --> 11:32.067
breaking things off with Ricky
and moving in with me as a friend.

11:37.373 --> 11:39.040
You're not having any pizza?

11:40.176 --> 11:41.810
Guess he's not having any pizza.

11:43.980 --> 11:46.782
I can eat my pizza somewhere
else if this is a bad time.

11:46.816 --> 11:49.518
Yeah, this is a bad time.

11:49.552 --> 11:51.720
I would do anything to get Ben to drop this

11:51.754 --> 11:53.688
stupid, stupid pursuit of Amy Juergens!

11:53.723 --> 11:56.658
- Maybe I can talk to him.
- No one can talk to him.

11:56.692 --> 11:59.261
My son is going to ruin
his life no matter what.

11:59.295 --> 12:02.130
He's already wasted his high school years

12:02.165 --> 12:03.432
and now it continues into college.

12:11.643 --> 12:14.678
- Hey.
- Hey. I said I didn't want any pizza.

12:14.712 --> 12:17.514
Okay, well, I'm going to have some pizza

12:17.549 --> 12:19.583
and I don't have anyone to
talk to while I eat the pizza,

12:19.617 --> 12:20.717
so can I hang out in here?

12:20.752 --> 12:22.352
I'm feeling kind of lonely.

12:22.387 --> 12:24.154
Chloe, you got to make
some friends, all right?

12:24.189 --> 12:26.490
I've got about a month to find
the perfect apartment in Manhattan,

12:26.524 --> 12:29.059
so I'm kind of busy here with my life.

12:29.093 --> 12:30.360
All right, well, I can help you.

12:30.395 --> 12:32.162
I know how to use a computer.

12:32.197 --> 12:33.363
Or I could bring my computer in here

12:33.398 --> 12:35.065
and we can get online at the same time.

12:35.099 --> 12:36.967
Look, it's just that...

12:37.001 --> 12:38.936
I'd like to include you
in what I'm doing here,

12:38.970 --> 12:41.705
but I talk to you and you talk to Dad,

12:41.739 --> 12:43.640
so I don't really want to
include you, not to be rude.

12:43.675 --> 12:44.741
Yeah, not to be rude.

12:44.776 --> 12:46.877
We're not friends,
we're brother and sister.

12:46.911 --> 12:49.413
Or like brother and sister.

12:49.447 --> 12:50.480
- Like?
- Come on.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.517
You're coming here at 16 and I'm 18

12:53.551 --> 12:55.619
and we're not brother and
sister and we're not friends.

12:55.653 --> 12:58.555
We're just living in the same
house with the same parents.

12:58.590 --> 13:01.291
But I'm moving out soon and you
can have them all to yourself.

13:01.326 --> 13:02.426
And good luck with that.

13:02.460 --> 13:04.027
I know it's nice living here and all,

13:04.062 --> 13:05.929
but you may find it a bit restrictive

13:05.964 --> 13:08.031
if there's ever anything you want
to do that they don't want you to do,

13:08.066 --> 13:09.166
like grow up.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.868
All right, I'll just eat this in my room.

13:11.903 --> 13:13.070
Bon appÃ©tit.

13:13.104 --> 13:14.972
Hey...

13:15.006 --> 13:16.707
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

13:16.741 --> 13:18.909
I'm just... I'm a little caught
up with this apartment thing.

13:18.943 --> 13:20.978
No, you didn't hurt my feelings.

13:21.012 --> 13:23.780
And I do have friends
and I have my own life.

13:23.815 --> 13:25.549
I just thought I would try to talk to you

13:25.583 --> 13:27.451
because your dad can't
seem to talk to you, so...

13:27.485 --> 13:29.586
So, yeah, that's what I thought
that was it. Go eat your pizza.

13:37.562 --> 13:40.130
Hi, sweetie.

13:40.164 --> 13:41.265
Are you sure you don't
want anything to eat?

13:41.299 --> 13:43.066
No, I'm not really hungry.

13:43.101 --> 13:45.269
I have to go back to school tomorrow
and I have this test tomorrow,

13:45.303 --> 13:47.170
so I just kind of want to be alone.

13:50.742 --> 13:51.942
Seriously. I need to be alone.

13:51.976 --> 13:53.977
So do I, but Eva is here

13:54.012 --> 13:56.580
- and I told her I wanted to be with you.
- What's she doing here?

13:56.614 --> 13:59.516
She thinks she's helping,
she wants to help.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.418
Help do what? She can't bring Grandma back.

14:03.354 --> 14:04.554
Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

14:04.589 --> 14:05.656
You seem kind of angry.

14:05.690 --> 14:07.491
Well, aren't you?

14:07.525 --> 14:09.526
I guess the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

14:11.296 --> 14:13.063
I mean, it just seems so unfair.

14:13.097 --> 14:15.198
Like, she finally shows
up after all these years

14:15.266 --> 14:17.968
and then we find out we've been
robbed of a relationship with her

14:18.002 --> 14:20.003
because Grandpa was in some kind of cult.

14:20.038 --> 14:22.873
I am never going to let some
guy tell me what to do or think.

14:22.907 --> 14:24.074
I hope not. I'm not.

14:24.108 --> 14:25.776
Okay.

14:25.810 --> 14:26.843
And just because Jack wants
to get married right now,

14:26.878 --> 14:28.645
I'm not going to get married right now.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.013
I'm not going to get married
before I'm ready to get married.

14:30.048 --> 14:31.682
But you're wearing an engagement ring.

14:31.716 --> 14:32.883
So what?

14:32.917 --> 14:34.618
I can wear this thing for
years before we get married.

14:34.652 --> 14:36.586
Is that what you're planning, you and Jack,

14:36.621 --> 14:37.721
to be engaged for years?

14:37.755 --> 14:39.523
I don't know!

14:39.557 --> 14:41.458
Now he wants to follow me to
whatever school I get into,

14:41.492 --> 14:43.427
but I don't want him to follow me.

14:43.461 --> 14:46.430
Like, I want him to be his own
person and go to his own school.

14:46.464 --> 14:49.366
And you would go to a school out of state?

14:49.400 --> 14:52.002
It would make things a little
bit difficult, don't you think?

14:52.036 --> 14:53.370
Not for me.

14:53.404 --> 14:56.139
I'm not going to school to see
what other guys are out there

14:56.174 --> 14:57.774
or to date or have a good time.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.843
I'm going to school to study
to get into medical school,

14:59.877 --> 15:01.712
which is why I can't go to Jack's school,

15:01.746 --> 15:03.246
which doesn't mean he
should go to my school.

15:03.281 --> 15:05.882
You can't go to Jack's school or you
don't want to go to Jack's school?

15:05.917 --> 15:07.718
You just lost your
mother. I can handle this.

15:07.752 --> 15:10.520
Well, honey, you haven't lost
your mother, I'm right here.

15:11.622 --> 15:14.524
Grace, tell me what's going on.

15:14.559 --> 15:15.659
I saw you crying at my wedding.

15:17.595 --> 15:19.296
You're not going away to school

15:19.330 --> 15:21.198
because you don't want to be here,

15:21.232 --> 15:23.133
where you'd be around George and me?

15:23.167 --> 15:24.334
That's not it, is it?

15:24.369 --> 15:27.003
I could tell you that was
it, but that's not the truth.

15:27.038 --> 15:28.972
The truth is I'm not
going to be like Grandma

15:29.006 --> 15:30.874
when she was married to Grandpa.

15:30.908 --> 15:31.975
I'm not even going to be like
you when you were married to Dad.

15:32.009 --> 15:33.944
I'm going to be like me.

15:33.978 --> 15:35.879
And I am going to do what I want
to do and be married to Jack.

15:35.913 --> 15:38.615
Well, marriage is all about compromise.

15:38.649 --> 15:40.550
At 18 you want me to compromise?

15:40.585 --> 15:43.453
No. I am sure that Jack
can do what he wants to do

15:43.488 --> 15:45.522
and I can do what I want
to do and we can be married.

15:50.361 --> 15:52.362
I guess your mom just
doesn't have an appetite.

15:52.397 --> 15:54.331
Guess not.

15:54.365 --> 15:58.101
Tom, I really feel like
I need to hit the road.

15:58.136 --> 16:01.938
You can't. The other grandma just left.

16:01.973 --> 16:03.240
You can't leave, too.

16:03.274 --> 16:05.776
It's different. I can come back.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.145
My mom lost her mother, she needs you.

16:08.179 --> 16:09.646
For what, Tom?

16:09.680 --> 16:10.847
To do what mothers do.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.016
I don't do what mothers do.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.651
I'm not that clingy.

16:15.753 --> 16:17.821
My son's grown up and he's on his own

16:17.855 --> 16:20.690
and he and your mom just got
married, and they need time to...

16:20.725 --> 16:23.493
They've been doing that
and I need a grandma.

16:23.528 --> 16:25.395
I really never had one.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.597
I can be your grandma and
send you postcards and stuff.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.366
That's not what a grandma is.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.134
You're supposed to knit me things.

16:31.169 --> 16:32.302
I don't knit, Tom.

16:32.336 --> 16:34.237
- You can learn.
- I don't want to learn.

16:34.272 --> 16:35.972
It's me, isn't it?

16:36.007 --> 16:38.942
You didn't know about me.

16:38.976 --> 16:41.678
You don't want to be my grandma, do you?

16:41.712 --> 16:43.780
Oh, Tom, of course I do.

16:46.918 --> 16:50.487
Oh, hi, Eva. Um...

16:50.521 --> 16:52.389
I'm just gonna be upstairs.

16:52.423 --> 16:55.725
- Anything I can do?
- Oh, no, no. Thank you, though. Um...

16:55.760 --> 16:57.561
maybe George could use
you at the restaurant.

16:57.595 --> 17:00.130
He always needs help down there,

17:00.164 --> 17:02.466
and I just need to spend some time alone.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.035
Goodnight.

17:07.003 --> 17:10.140
See? I'm not really needed.

17:10.174 --> 17:13.910
They've just been pretending to
need me to make me feel better.

17:13.944 --> 17:14.911
And it doesn't.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.880
- I need you.
- No, you don't.

17:30.279 --> 17:32.381
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy, you got to do me a favor.

17:32.415 --> 17:35.050
Tell my mom to go home. To go
over to my house or something.

17:35.084 --> 17:36.385
She's getting on your mother's nerves.

17:36.419 --> 17:40.822
What? You two told me to make
her feel like she's needed.

17:41.157 --> 17:42.891
Oh!

17:42.925 --> 17:45.994
That was days ago. I love her, but
your mom and I need to be alone.

17:46.028 --> 17:47.095
But I like her.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.765
I like having a Grandma.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.967
I love her, she's my mother,
but this is not a good time.

17:52.001 --> 17:53.568
Your mom and I just got married,

17:53.603 --> 17:55.404
and she just lost her mother,

17:55.438 --> 17:57.606
and we need time with each
other. Just each other.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.707
I got it.

18:00.476 --> 18:02.677
Thank God. Phew! I can go now.

18:02.712 --> 18:07.516
I want to go. I never get to go anywhere.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.251
Ever ridden on the back of a bike?

18:14.416 --> 18:16.150
What...

18:16.184 --> 18:17.518
What do you mean you found
a condo for us to buy?

18:17.552 --> 18:19.220
I saw some condos when I was there

18:19.254 --> 18:21.322
and the one I like,
there are other offers on.

18:21.356 --> 18:23.224
But they're going to take
offers through this weekend

18:23.258 --> 18:26.093
so we should either look at it
together or you should trust me.

18:26.128 --> 18:27.962
I didn't even know you
were looking at condos.

18:27.996 --> 18:29.730
You never even mentioned that to me.

18:29.765 --> 18:32.600
The company has a department
that helps people with relocation

18:32.634 --> 18:35.669
and the woman just suggested that
we look at some possibilities and...

18:35.704 --> 18:38.506
Oh! So you and some woman

18:38.540 --> 18:39.807
picked out a place for you and me?

18:41.476 --> 18:42.777
- What?
- That's her job,

18:42.811 --> 18:45.312
to help people relocate.

18:45.347 --> 18:47.281
I just wanted to see what was out there.

18:47.315 --> 18:48.549
And there's this one condo that is so...

18:48.583 --> 18:51.519
No! I told you, a year from now

18:51.553 --> 18:53.387
we'd get married and move there.

18:53.421 --> 18:56.023
I'm not going to rent for a
year and then buy something.

18:56.057 --> 18:57.391
That would be a waste of money.

18:57.425 --> 18:59.326
Well, you're not going to live in
a condo for a year before I move in

18:59.361 --> 19:01.829
because then it would be like
me moving into your condo.

19:01.863 --> 19:03.164
- You mean like I did here?
- That's different, okay?

19:03.198 --> 19:05.065
I was living here when you met me.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.034
So it's your place that we're living in,

19:07.068 --> 19:08.903
whereas it would be our place in New York

19:08.937 --> 19:10.771
that I live in until we're
ready to live there together.

19:10.806 --> 19:12.907
You know what?

19:12.941 --> 19:15.543
Your mother told me
how much she missed you.

19:15.577 --> 19:16.744
So why don't you go
spend the night over there

19:16.778 --> 19:17.812
'cause I really don't feel
like seeing you right now.

19:17.846 --> 19:18.879
I just got back.

19:18.914 --> 19:20.514
I just got used to your being gone.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.724
Okay, then, fine.

19:33.535 --> 19:35.269
Couldn't have come at a worse time.

19:35.303 --> 19:36.403
Do you have an office where we can talk?

19:36.438 --> 19:38.105
- No.
- Yes, you do.

19:39.274 --> 19:40.174
I'll meet you at the bar.

19:44.012 --> 19:45.212
Hey, you don't happen
to like women, do you?

19:45.247 --> 19:46.847
Redheads?

19:49.084 --> 19:50.784
The hostess will be right with you.

19:55.724 --> 19:56.790
So, where's Robie? In your purse?

19:56.825 --> 19:58.659
He's with his father tonight.

19:58.693 --> 20:00.427
I went to the house to pack up a few things

20:00.462 --> 20:01.729
since I heard you got married.

20:01.763 --> 20:03.464
What, you just heard?
That was almost a week ago.

20:03.498 --> 20:06.400
- I thought Amy told you.
- Yesterday, just yesterday.

20:06.434 --> 20:08.535
You couldn't let me know? I like Kathleen.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.238
I'm glad you like Kathleen, but we
don't have to tell you what we're doing.

20:11.273 --> 20:12.473
It was spur of the moment.

20:12.507 --> 20:14.174
And I don't really see how our
getting married concerns you.

20:14.209 --> 20:15.476
You're living in my house.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.278
Not anymore.

20:17.312 --> 20:19.280
You don't see how that presents a
problem, you not living in my house?

20:19.314 --> 20:21.148
It really doesn't until Nora's not there,

20:21.182 --> 20:23.050
and then it's a problem
because it's an empty house.

20:23.084 --> 20:25.152
Okay, fine, George, I'm dealing with it.

20:25.186 --> 20:26.754
So, fine.

20:28.790 --> 20:29.857
- You bought the restaurant?
- Yep.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.493
So you were hiding money.

20:32.527 --> 20:33.894
I wouldn't say hiding, exactly.

20:33.929 --> 20:35.529
What are you going to do about it, sue me?

20:35.563 --> 20:38.565
Nothing. I'm not going to sue you.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.634
I have enough money of my
own without taking yours,

20:40.669 --> 20:42.569
even though I am entitled to it, thank you.

20:42.604 --> 20:44.571
You have enough money to buy
me out of the furniture store?

20:44.606 --> 20:46.440
I asked Donovan, but he
can't, he's got five kids.

20:46.474 --> 20:48.208
I'm not here to help you out.

20:48.243 --> 20:49.376
I am not here to solve your problems.

20:49.411 --> 20:52.012
I'm here to solve mine.

20:52.047 --> 20:53.314
That being said, I might be interested

20:53.348 --> 20:55.349
in buying out your share
of the furniture store.

20:55.383 --> 20:57.851
You might as well, you're
there more than I am anyway.

20:57.886 --> 20:59.186
And I want a clean break.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.220
I don't want to be tangled
up with you anymore.

21:00.255 --> 21:02.756
Nice. Well, I'm married now.

21:02.791 --> 21:04.925
And we don't have a son and our
daughters are living their own lives

21:04.960 --> 21:06.827
and you're living your
life, so there you go.

21:06.861 --> 21:08.896
"There you go"? That's it?

21:08.930 --> 21:12.566
No notice, no discussion, no attempt
to be civil, just, "There you go"?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.768
What do you want from me,
Anne? I've been busy all week.

21:14.803 --> 21:16.570
Kathleen's mother showed
up, my mother showed up,

21:16.604 --> 21:18.305
then Kathleen and I got married

21:18.340 --> 21:19.673
and then her mother
passed away the next day.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.342
We just had the funeral today.

21:21.376 --> 21:22.543
I haven't had time for civilization.

21:22.577 --> 21:24.244
Your mother was here?

21:24.279 --> 21:26.180
- I love your mother.
- And she likes you.

21:26.214 --> 21:27.314
Maybe you can take her to Palm Springs.

21:27.349 --> 21:30.250
Wait. Kathleen's mother passed away?

21:30.285 --> 21:31.885
She passed away and there was a funeral

21:31.920 --> 21:33.020
and I didn't know about that either?

21:33.054 --> 21:34.188
You're not part of our family.

21:34.222 --> 21:36.790
This is my new family.

21:36.825 --> 21:38.158
Kathleen was the old family, but now she's
the new family and you're the old one.

21:38.193 --> 21:40.661
And that's just how it
is. She's the priority now.

21:40.695 --> 21:43.697
Okay. I got it, old husband.

21:43.732 --> 21:46.500
And just so you know, I
told our old oldest daughter

21:46.534 --> 21:47.935
that she and John and Ricky can get married

21:47.969 --> 21:49.770
and live in the house with Nora,

21:49.804 --> 21:51.839
or she can move to New
York and be a single mom

21:51.873 --> 21:53.707
and I'll sell the house
in order to sponsor that,

21:53.742 --> 21:56.677
but if, and only if, she
decides not to get married.

21:56.711 --> 21:59.279
Because you know what? I'm not so
sure that she wants to be married.

21:59.314 --> 22:00.514
That's not your family either.

22:00.548 --> 22:02.249
So why don't you leave them alone, too

22:02.283 --> 22:05.052
and not set up a reward for
Amy doing the wrong thing?

22:05.086 --> 22:07.187
She needs to get married, go to school here

22:07.222 --> 22:09.156
be a mother to John and wife to Ricky,

22:09.190 --> 22:10.357
and that's all there is to it.

22:10.392 --> 22:12.326
Well, you have your
opinion, and I have mine.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.928
I can offer my daughter anything
I want to offer my daughter.

22:14.963 --> 22:17.031
You don't see anything wrong in bribing
your daughter to do something immoral?

22:17.065 --> 22:19.767
Being a single mom is immoral?

22:19.801 --> 22:20.801
I'm a single mom.

22:20.835 --> 22:22.036
Yeah.

22:24.773 --> 22:26.874
No, I'm not telling you I'm going
to summer school, I'm asking you.

22:26.908 --> 22:29.476
You're asking me after you signed up.

22:29.511 --> 22:32.679
Did you ask me to set a date for the
wedding before or after you signed up?

22:32.714 --> 22:34.248
What difference does it make?

22:34.282 --> 22:35.449
Before or after?

22:35.483 --> 22:37.418
About the same time!

22:37.452 --> 22:40.054
No, no, no, not about the
same time! Before or after!

22:40.088 --> 22:42.089
Okay, fine. You know what?
Before. But who cares!

22:42.123 --> 22:44.158
I care! You just gave me what I wanted

22:44.192 --> 22:45.259
so you could have what you wanted and

22:45.293 --> 22:47.261
then you were dishonest about it!

22:47.295 --> 22:49.129
This is the biggest decision that
we're ever going to make together

22:49.164 --> 22:50.898
and you're being dishonest about it!

22:50.932 --> 22:52.166
You know what, if you don't like
it, why don't you just leave?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.034
Huh?

22:54.069 --> 22:55.836
Oh, what? You still
consider this your apartment?

22:55.870 --> 22:57.071
Fine. I'll leave.

22:57.105 --> 22:59.006
Really, I should be the one to leave.

23:00.942 --> 23:04.445
Margaret and Shakur are coming
to pick me up. Goodnight.

23:04.479 --> 23:05.779
- When did he get here?
- Hours ago.

23:05.814 --> 23:07.781
He needed to use the computer.

23:07.816 --> 23:10.451
Ugh. You know what? I'm gonna go
over to my dad's house for the night.

23:10.485 --> 23:12.686
I really don't feel like
being with you right now.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.654
Goodnight.

23:20.721 --> 23:22.622
Hey, there.

23:22.656 --> 23:24.891
Brought you some ice cream,
thought it might help.

23:24.925 --> 23:25.892
Help what?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.593
Ease your pain.

23:27.628 --> 23:29.428
It's Rocky Road.

23:29.463 --> 23:32.465
Because life is a rocky road and I'm
here to help you get down that road.

23:32.499 --> 23:35.401
Thank you, but I don't
really want any ice cream.

23:35.435 --> 23:37.336
Besides, I don't really want
to be bad to myself right now

23:37.371 --> 23:39.605
by eating junk when my grandmother
just died of heart disease.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.475
So I'll just put it in the
freezer. You can eat it later.

23:45.078 --> 23:47.313
Okay, well, um, thank you
for coming over to bring that.

23:47.347 --> 23:48.381
Goodnight.

23:48.415 --> 23:50.283
I thought I'd stick around.

23:50.317 --> 23:52.151
I thought you were going to
give me some time to myself.

23:52.185 --> 23:54.921
You shouldn't be alone at
a time like this, Grace.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.822
Come on, let me be
there for you. I owe you.

23:56.857 --> 23:59.692
Okay. If you really want to
do something for me, go home.

23:59.726 --> 24:00.993
I really want to do something for you,

24:01.028 --> 24:02.595
but that's not what I want to do.

24:02.629 --> 24:05.464
I want to stay here
tonight and be with you.

24:05.499 --> 24:06.666
Is that how this is gonna be?

24:06.700 --> 24:08.634
Like, I tell you what I want, what I need,

24:08.669 --> 24:10.603
and you just tell me you're
going to do something else?

24:10.637 --> 24:12.538
Like, I am my own person.
I'm going to get what I want,

24:12.573 --> 24:14.607
whatever is the right thing
for me. Not you, for me!

24:14.641 --> 24:16.509
Not you and me, but me!

24:16.543 --> 24:19.345
Grace, no offense, but
that doesn't sound very

24:19.379 --> 24:20.446
compromising.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.148
I mean, marriage is all about compromise.

24:22.182 --> 24:24.517
I'm not gonna compromise!
Not tonight, not any night!

24:24.551 --> 24:26.452
You want to stay here, you stay here!

24:26.486 --> 24:28.287
Well, that's compromising, isn't it?

24:28.322 --> 24:29.288
I'm leaving.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.874
I wish someone had let me know.

24:48.909 --> 24:53.512
I would have sent flowers
or called you or something.

24:53.547 --> 24:55.581
Aw. That's really sweet, Anne,

24:55.616 --> 24:58.651
but there was nothing
anyone could really do.

24:58.685 --> 25:01.153
It took a few days to notify my dad,

25:01.188 --> 25:03.389
and then he actually sent a telegram

25:03.423 --> 25:07.093
saying that he and his new wife
were unable to come to the funeral.

25:07.127 --> 25:09.929
- That's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

25:09.963 --> 25:12.231
But I guess in his
eyes, my mom betrayed him

25:12.265 --> 25:15.034
so he'd already said goodbye to her.

25:15.068 --> 25:16.102
Well, is there anything I can do?

25:16.136 --> 25:18.104
I don't think so.

25:18.138 --> 25:20.640
- Unless...
- Unless?

25:20.674 --> 25:22.708
How well do you know George's mom?

25:22.743 --> 25:23.943
Well, I haven't seen much of her

25:23.977 --> 25:26.512
since the girls were in elementary school.

25:26.546 --> 25:28.447
She used to spend the summer
with us here and there,

25:28.482 --> 25:29.682
but she's always been a bit of a nomad.

25:29.716 --> 25:31.651
Do you think she would
like to see Palm Springs?

25:31.685 --> 25:33.552
George already asked me to ask her.

25:33.587 --> 25:35.421
She's great, don't get me wrong,

25:35.455 --> 25:38.090
but I just... I really want to settle
in with George and she's just...

25:38.125 --> 25:39.358
- I got it.
- Thank you.

25:39.393 --> 25:42.228
And if she doesn't want to
go, it's fine, we'll be okay.

25:42.295 --> 25:44.930
No, I can talk her into it, I'm sure.

25:44.965 --> 25:48.200
And thank you for asking
me to do something.

25:48.235 --> 25:51.771
I'm feeling a bit like
a woman with no country.

25:51.805 --> 25:56.642
I don't have my old
family, as George puts it,

25:56.677 --> 25:58.944
and I don't have a new family,

25:58.979 --> 26:02.448
so I'm just feeling a little bit lost.

26:02.482 --> 26:07.286
Anyway, I guess I thought that since we've
all known each other for such a long time,

26:07.320 --> 26:09.555
and you and I get along, and
our daughters are friends,

26:09.589 --> 26:11.557
I don't know, I just...

26:11.591 --> 26:14.493
I guess I thought that I would
still be a part of the family.

26:17.364 --> 26:19.131
That sounds ridiculous now that I say it.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.233
No. No, it doesn't.

26:21.268 --> 26:23.235
- It does to George.
- I'll talk to George.

26:23.270 --> 26:25.905
You know, he's... he's
still angry about Robie.

26:25.939 --> 26:27.773
He's angry?

26:27.808 --> 26:29.842
I still can't believe that
he claimed to be his father.

26:29.876 --> 26:31.010
A noble gesture.

26:31.044 --> 26:34.714
Completely misguided
and legally-questionable,

26:36.783 --> 26:38.918
but I guess you could
also consider it noble.

26:41.488 --> 26:43.656
- Sorry.
- I thought you weren't speaking to me.

26:43.690 --> 26:45.324
You've hardly spoken to me all week.

26:45.358 --> 26:47.326
Yeah, well, I missed you.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.428
You just showed up because you missed me.

26:49.463 --> 26:52.431
All right, I was at
Ricky's using his computer

26:52.466 --> 26:56.102
and Amy came home and they
got into a big argument

26:56.136 --> 26:59.105
and I didn't want to wait for
Shakur and Margaret to pick me up

26:59.139 --> 27:01.741
so I took the bus here.

27:01.775 --> 27:03.042
I knew how to take the bus here.

27:03.076 --> 27:04.844
Oh. Okay.

27:04.878 --> 27:07.012
So it had nothing to do
with your wanting to see me,

27:07.047 --> 27:09.582
it was just convenient for you to drop by.

27:09.616 --> 27:10.716
Yeah, but I wanted to see you.

27:10.751 --> 27:12.485
Really?

27:12.519 --> 27:13.753
You've avoided me all week at school.

27:13.787 --> 27:15.688
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.

27:15.722 --> 27:19.358
Well, I've had a lot of tests and...

27:20.694 --> 27:23.162
I'm still getting the hang of algebra.

27:24.431 --> 27:25.431
Are you still coaching Brian?

27:25.465 --> 27:26.999
Are you still helping Layla?

27:27.033 --> 27:28.400
Helping her with algebra? No.

27:28.435 --> 27:31.070
Are you going out with Layla?

27:31.104 --> 27:34.807
Going out with her? I can't
drive, where are we going to go?

27:34.841 --> 27:36.142
Answering a question with a question

27:36.176 --> 27:38.077
is usually a sign that someone is lying.

27:38.111 --> 27:39.812
Really?

27:39.846 --> 27:42.615
Well, you answered my
question with a question.

27:42.649 --> 27:43.783
Are you coaching Brian?

27:43.817 --> 27:45.684
Yeah, I am.

27:45.719 --> 27:47.653
But I am not going out with Brian.

27:47.687 --> 27:48.821
I didn't ask you that.

27:49.656 --> 27:51.357
Look, Kathy,

27:52.626 --> 27:54.493
you're my girlfriend,

27:54.528 --> 27:58.264
or I want you to be my girlfriend,

27:58.298 --> 28:00.032
and I really did want to see you.

28:00.066 --> 28:02.902
I've been wanting to talk to you because...

28:05.038 --> 28:07.006
I just want to know where we stand.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.040
Because?

28:08.074 --> 28:10.676
Because I want to know.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.945
Because I care about you.

28:12.979 --> 28:15.881
And because, honestly,
Layla is offering me things

28:15.916 --> 28:21.453
that would put us on an equal status.

28:26.459 --> 28:28.594
You can wait for your
parents on my front steps.

28:30.297 --> 28:31.530
Goodnight and goodbye.

28:31.565 --> 28:33.332
I hope we can still be...

28:34.501 --> 28:37.136
Hey, kiddo, we're taking off.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.170
Just wanted to let you know.

28:38.205 --> 28:40.139
And you can let my mother know.

28:40.173 --> 28:41.941
And by taking off, you mean what?

28:41.975 --> 28:43.209
A spin around the neighborhood?

28:43.243 --> 28:46.145
Salmon fishing in Alaska. I
got some friends up there...

28:46.179 --> 28:48.881
Oh, no, no! You cannot go to Alaska.

28:48.915 --> 28:50.950
Why not? It's a beautiful ride.

28:50.984 --> 28:52.852
We're going to see the
Redwoods on the way up.

28:52.886 --> 28:54.486
Did you ask your mother about this?

28:54.521 --> 28:56.856
I'm a grown man. I left a note.

28:56.890 --> 28:58.791
Well, I doubt she's found it or
she would have called me by now.

28:58.825 --> 29:02.494
I know, that's why I
said you could tell her.

29:02.529 --> 29:03.629
I need a word with my mom, Tom.

29:03.663 --> 29:05.331
No. I know what you're going to say.

29:06.499 --> 29:07.499
Damn it.

29:10.170 --> 29:12.171
- What?
- Uh, Mom, Tom has a job.

29:12.205 --> 29:13.472
He can't just hop on a bike and take off.

29:13.506 --> 29:15.374
He called his boss, Milton.

29:15.408 --> 29:18.210
Milton said he could go. Once
in a lifetime opportunity.

29:18.245 --> 29:21.313
- He has to ask his mother.
- He asked your mother and I said yes.

29:21.348 --> 29:24.183
Come on. Tom on the back of
a bike for thousands of miles?

29:24.217 --> 29:26.118
- I've never had an accident.
- I know that, but...

29:26.152 --> 29:29.121
But what? We're not wanted
at home, we're taking off.

29:29.155 --> 29:30.122
Who said you're not wanted?

29:32.125 --> 29:34.760
It's just... I know.

29:34.794 --> 29:38.731
You just got married, her mom
died, there's stuff going on.

29:38.765 --> 29:42.601
I don't take any offense,
but I think Tom did somehow.

29:42.636 --> 29:44.436
Did you tell him you need time alonf?

29:44.471 --> 29:46.639
- Yeah, but...
- But you just meant me.

29:46.673 --> 29:48.540
- I love you, Mom.
- I know.

29:48.575 --> 29:51.243
We can go a decade
without seeing each other

29:51.278 --> 29:55.481
and when we do  it's still nice.

29:55.515 --> 29:59.084
If you want to go up to the Redwoods for
a night, I can probably make that fly.

30:03.156 --> 30:05.157
Hi, Kathleen, don't worry, they're
here, they haven't gone anywhere.

30:05.191 --> 30:07.126
But they're going to Alaska?

30:07.160 --> 30:10.062
- I don't know about that.
- Well, I think it's fantastic!

30:10.096 --> 30:11.897
Tom on a motorcycle,

30:11.932 --> 30:15.067
off with his new grandma, seeing
things he's never seen before,

30:15.101 --> 30:17.970
while we're here, just
hanging out and being a family.

30:18.004 --> 30:21.674
- Just you and me?
- Well, and Jack and Grace. And Anne.

30:21.708 --> 30:24.576
- Who's Anne?
- Oh, George, she stopped by and...

30:24.611 --> 30:26.712
Honey, Anne is part of our family, too.

30:26.746 --> 30:28.480
I mean, we're all just one big family.

30:28.515 --> 30:30.249
And she's welcome here anytime.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.451
Maybe I'll come with you.

30:32.485 --> 30:36.255
You can't. You're married
now. Your life is over!

30:39.092 --> 30:40.326
It's nice of you to be nice to my ex,

30:40.360 --> 30:42.027
but our lives are just starting

30:42.062 --> 30:43.329
and I can't wait to get home to you,

30:43.363 --> 30:46.298
so say goodnight to Anne for
me and send her on her way.

30:46.333 --> 30:49.034
- I love you, Kathleen.
- I love you, too, George.

30:54.087 --> 30:55.621
Chloe? Can I come in?

30:57.891 --> 30:59.858
Hi, brother Ben.

31:02.462 --> 31:05.297
Uh, I just want to talk to you about...

31:05.331 --> 31:09.234
Do you want to put something over that?

31:10.637 --> 31:14.406
- Why? Because that's...
- That's a little...

31:14.441 --> 31:16.175
little.

31:16.209 --> 31:19.011
I like you, Ben, you know that.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.314
And I can make you forget
all about Amy Juergens.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.017
- Goodnight.
- Wait.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.286
Chloe, you're not a hooker, all right?

31:27.320 --> 31:30.889
You're a nice girl, okay?
You don't do this anymore.

31:30.924 --> 31:32.825
I do if it will help someone.

31:32.859 --> 31:33.892
No, you don't.

31:33.927 --> 31:36.662
Look...  Chloe,

31:36.696 --> 31:39.598
even if having sex with you would make
me forget Amy for the rest of my life,

31:39.632 --> 31:41.733
I wouldn't do that to you.

31:41.768 --> 31:43.702
You went through too much
and you've worked too hard

31:43.736 --> 31:45.404
to make a new life for yourself,

31:47.507 --> 31:49.374
and we've done a lot for you here,

31:49.409 --> 31:52.277
my dad has anyway,

31:52.312 --> 31:54.513
but you've also done a lot for yourself.

31:54.547 --> 31:56.215
Don't go back there,

31:57.150 --> 31:58.450
don't be that girl again.

31:58.518 --> 32:00.085
We care about you.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.054
I care about you.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.890
As a sister and a friend.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.993
Goodnight.

32:09.796 --> 32:13.832
And I'm not going to
tell my dad about this,

32:13.867 --> 32:15.701
and I don't think that you should, either.

32:15.735 --> 32:19.738
Just talk to Dr. Fields, all right?

32:35.488 --> 32:37.156
I forgot something.

32:37.190 --> 32:39.291
Oh, yeah? What's that, Omar?

32:40.593 --> 32:43.095
I forgot to kiss you goodnight.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.963
I don't want to kiss you goodnight.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.866
- I love you, Adrian.
- No, you don't.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.868
No, I do.

32:49.903 --> 32:51.970
And I want to marry you right now,

32:52.005 --> 32:53.138
but if you want to wait
a year, we can wait a year

32:53.173 --> 32:55.674
and then we'll look for
something to buy together.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.777
Who cares if I waste a
year's rent in New York,

32:58.811 --> 33:00.946
as long as you love me
and want to marry me.

33:01.781 --> 33:03.482
What's a year?

33:04.072 --> 33:06.485
I won?

33:06.519 --> 33:10.322
- Yeah, if we don't mind wasting a year's rent in New York.
- I don't mind.

33:11.558 --> 33:14.660
Adrian, it's like $60,000.

33:14.694 --> 33:17.162
It's a lot of money, that's
why we should buy something now.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.195
But we don't mind wasting the money

33:19.229 --> 33:21.164
so we're not going to, right?

33:21.198 --> 33:23.366
Besides, you'll get to
know New York and so will I

33:23.400 --> 33:27.203
and we'll know more about where we
want to live this time next year,

33:27.237 --> 33:28.971
when I pick out the condo.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.339
- With me.
- Yes, of course with you.

33:30.374 --> 33:32.108
Why don't you go to New York alone

33:32.142 --> 33:34.777
and let this woman from
our company take you out

33:34.811 --> 33:37.747
to look at some condos and
see what you come up with?

33:37.781 --> 33:41.684
Why don't we go to bed and
see what we come up with?

33:50.827 --> 33:52.628
I see how I keep losing.

33:58.468 --> 34:00.203
I finished the ice cream.

34:00.237 --> 34:01.370
You want to come back or do
you still feel like being alone?

34:01.405 --> 34:02.438
I still feel like being alone.

34:09.346 --> 34:12.114
Why do you do that? I just said to
you that I still feel like being alone.

34:12.149 --> 34:13.916
Nobody feels like being alone.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.117
It's lonely being alone.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.918
No, sometimes it's good to be alone.

34:16.954 --> 34:20.056
Yeah, but, Grace, not
for the rest of your life.

34:20.090 --> 34:23.659
I know you're having second
thoughts about getting married,

34:23.694 --> 34:24.694
but it'soing to be fine, Grace.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.027
I'm going to be a good husband to you.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.831
I know we're young, but we've been in love

34:28.864 --> 34:30.565
since the first time we saw each other.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.833
You mean in heat. We've been in heat

34:31.868 --> 34:33.603
since the first time we saw each other.

34:33.637 --> 34:35.605
The two feelings are kind of confusing.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.574
But I love you and I want to marry you

34:38.609 --> 34:40.309
and I want to sleep with you right now

34:40.344 --> 34:41.476
and for the rest of our lives.

34:41.511 --> 34:44.213
Right now? You want to
sleep with me right now?

34:44.248 --> 34:47.250
Well, of course I do, but I'm not
gonna. We're going to wait, right?

34:47.284 --> 34:49.252
Yeah. But, I don't know, I mean, maybe...

34:49.286 --> 34:51.219
maybe that's what's wrong with me.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.989
Maybe I'm anxious about
getting married because

34:53.023 --> 34:55.858
I'm nervous about sleeping with you again.

34:55.891 --> 34:58.961
What if the first time was only
exciting because it was the first time?

34:58.996 --> 35:01.731
What if we're not compatible that
way? Maybe we should find out.

35:01.765 --> 35:03.866
Grace, come on, we're going
to be compatible that way.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.636
We don't have to sleep with each
other right now to know that.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.804
All right, well, all
I'm saying is, we could.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.444
Did you find whatever you were looking for?

35:15.479 --> 35:18.381
Yeah, I just needed my lotion.

35:18.415 --> 35:19.749
It's hypo-allergenic.

35:19.783 --> 35:22.218
I need to use it after
I shower in the morning.

35:22.252 --> 35:23.352
All right, goodnight.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.154
Goodnight.

35:25.188 --> 35:26.455
Any idea where you'll be in
case there's an emergency?

35:26.490 --> 35:27.523
I'm not sure yet.

35:27.557 --> 35:30.092
I mean, if I go to my dad's old house

35:30.127 --> 35:31.227
then your mother will know we're arguing,

35:31.261 --> 35:33.029
and if I go to his new house,

35:33.063 --> 35:36.132
then he and Kathleen and Grace
will know that we're arguing so...

35:36.166 --> 35:37.166
I really don't know.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.101
Well, text me if you figure it out.

35:39.136 --> 35:42.872
Of course, I'm sure
Ben's door is always open.

35:42.906 --> 35:44.073
Say hi to Leo for me.

35:44.107 --> 35:45.841
If I end up going over there, then I will.

35:45.876 --> 35:47.009
Goodnight.

35:47.044 --> 35:49.578
Oh, come on, you know I'm
not gonna go over there.

35:49.646 --> 35:51.047
No, I don't.

35:51.081 --> 35:53.749
In fact, for all I know, you and Ben
are living together at summer school.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.919
Um, actually, I do have a
solution to that housing situation.

35:56.953 --> 35:58.454
If you want to hear about it.

35:58.488 --> 35:59.622
I heard about it.

35:59.656 --> 36:02.558
Your mom offered to let me
and you and John live there.

36:02.592 --> 36:04.727
Which makes it a long commute to New York,

36:04.761 --> 36:07.496
so I don't really see how
that's a solution to your problem

36:07.531 --> 36:09.265
because I know you're not gonna do that.

36:09.299 --> 36:12.201
You're right. I'm not going to do that.

36:13.603 --> 36:18.107
I want to get married the day
after I graduate, like I said.

36:18.141 --> 36:21.277
I want us to be a family,
Ricky, a legal family.

36:21.311 --> 36:24.046
And we're going to have to live apart

36:24.081 --> 36:27.817
for the first few years of our
marriage, but it'll be okay.

36:27.851 --> 36:29.952
Just please, please let
me go to summer school

36:29.986 --> 36:31.887
without making it any big deal out of it.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.723
I just want to get started and get finished

36:33.757 --> 36:34.824
so that we can live together all the time.

36:37.828 --> 36:38.728
I love you.

36:40.697 --> 36:42.631
Are you sure you want to get married, Amy?

36:42.666 --> 36:45.868
Because if you don't, this
is the time to tell me.

36:47.804 --> 36:49.305
I want to get married.

36:58.413 --> 37:00.527
- I'm leaving.
- Bye, family.

37:01.617 --> 37:03.551
Bye.

37:03.585 --> 37:04.752
I love you. I love you.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.755
So I should tell the counselor...

37:07.790 --> 37:09.624
That you're going to summer school.

37:09.658 --> 37:11.592
We just don't know how we're
going to pay for the housing yet.

37:11.627 --> 37:14.529
I don't know either, but I love you, Amy.

37:14.563 --> 37:16.297
I love you, too.

37:16.331 --> 37:18.299
I'm so excited!

37:19.435 --> 37:20.601
I'm going to go by and tell my mom.

37:20.636 --> 37:22.570
She said she'd be at the
house, so if we leave now...

37:22.604 --> 37:24.305
Yes, leave now.

37:25.474 --> 37:26.441
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

37:30.412 --> 37:32.346
Come on, Mommy!

37:32.381 --> 37:34.148
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.863
Oh, George, you don't have
to do this every morning.

37:48.897 --> 37:50.064
I might want to do this every morning,

37:50.099 --> 37:52.667
especially if every
night is like last night.

37:52.701 --> 37:55.770
Oh, well, somehow my mother
dying really made me want to live.

37:58.507 --> 37:59.740
Good morning!

37:59.775 --> 38:00.708
Morning, George.

38:02.744 --> 38:04.745
She was already headed
up to bed when we talked.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.681
- You didn't know I was here?
- Didn't know you were here.

38:06.715 --> 38:08.382
Do you want some breakfast?

38:08.417 --> 38:10.585
No that's okay, I'm going
to head over to the house.

38:10.619 --> 38:11.619
Amy wanted to come over and see me.

38:11.653 --> 38:14.589
- Good luck with that bribe.
- It's not a bribe.

38:14.623 --> 38:17.125
- It's an option.
- An option?

38:17.159 --> 38:18.292
- To getting married.
- Oh.

38:18.327 --> 38:20.128
Maybe I should come up
with one of those myself.

38:20.162 --> 38:23.097
- Huh?
- For Grace.

38:23.132 --> 38:25.967
Thank you, Kathleen, for
inviting me to stay over

38:26.001 --> 38:27.268
and to be a part of your new life.

38:27.302 --> 38:29.203
- You're always welcome.
- Well, maybe not always.

38:29.238 --> 38:30.872
- Call first.
- Bye.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.840
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:39.982 --> 38:41.149
I thought I said...

38:41.183 --> 38:43.117
I know. I know what you said,

38:43.152 --> 38:45.786
but there's not the old
family and the new family.

38:45.821 --> 38:48.022
There's family and
we're all one family now.

38:48.056 --> 38:50.825
And that's what I want and I
know that's what you want, too.

38:50.859 --> 38:53.761
But you just can't let yourself
be nice for some reason.

38:53.795 --> 38:54.862
For many reasons.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.498
George, she's had a tough year.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.767
She taking care of her
mom who has Alzheimer's,

38:59.801 --> 39:03.638
she's a single mom now dealing
with the baby's father's family.

39:03.672 --> 39:04.772
She needs us.

39:06.475 --> 39:07.708
I'm fine with her being around.

39:07.743 --> 39:09.477
Because she's gay?

39:11.346 --> 39:12.313
Partly.

39:17.319 --> 39:18.586
I have to see you.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.289
All right, you can see me. What's going on?

39:21.323 --> 39:23.424
I did something really stupid.

39:23.458 --> 39:25.259
I had sex with Jack last night.

39:25.294 --> 39:26.527
How's that stupid? You're
going to be marrying the guy.

39:26.562 --> 39:28.262
I was trying to get out of the marriage.

39:28.297 --> 39:30.264
- With sex?
- I don't know how it happened.

39:30.299 --> 39:32.099
I know how it happened.

39:32.134 --> 39:36.837
Grace, I said I was going to wait
a year to get married to Omar,

39:36.872 --> 39:39.774
but I really need the year
to just think about it.

39:39.808 --> 39:41.042
I love him, but...

39:41.076 --> 39:42.810
I know! And I love Jack, too.

39:42.844 --> 39:44.011
And Omar really loves me.

39:44.046 --> 39:45.846
- And Jack loves me.
- I just...

39:47.082 --> 39:49.850
- I don't know.
- I don't know, either.

39:49.885 --> 39:51.986
Do you think we can get together
sometime in the next week?

39:52.020 --> 39:54.055
I just... I can't talk
to my mother about this.

39:54.089 --> 39:55.790
I can't tell her I slept with Jack.

39:55.824 --> 39:58.759
Yeah, definitely we'll get together.

39:58.794 --> 40:00.761
I think we should ask Amy
if she wants to join us.

40:00.796 --> 40:01.929
- Really?
- Really.

40:05.934 --> 40:06.901
Good morning!

40:08.003 --> 40:09.036
Is that for me?

40:11.974 --> 40:14.041
This is for you, Anne!

40:14.076 --> 40:17.745
This is for you! Good morning!

40:17.779 --> 40:19.747
What's all that shouting about?

40:20.082 --> 40:21.716
Oh. Hi, Anne.

40:21.750 --> 40:22.717
Hi.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.919
Oh...

40:24.987 --> 40:29.790
You remember Willowdine? My friend...
your friend, Willowdine, right?

40:29.825 --> 40:31.626
I'm sorry, Anne, we didn't realize.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.060
Well, I guess this is why
I haven't heard from you.

40:33.095 --> 40:35.563
Uh, we, um...

40:35.597 --> 40:37.598
we both switched groups and, uh,

40:39.034 --> 40:41.836
I got a different sponsor.

40:41.870 --> 40:44.972
I'm really sorry, Anne, I couldn't tell
you why I didn't want to be with you.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.874
Of course not.

40:46.908 --> 40:49.577
But good to see you're still
keeping it in the family.

40:49.611 --> 40:50.645
It's my fault.

40:50.679 --> 40:52.780
No, it's not, it's my fault. I...

40:52.814 --> 40:54.682
I don't love you, I love her.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.051
I love Nora.

40:57.085 --> 40:59.720
And I just didn't realize
that till after we got together

40:59.755 --> 41:03.591
that I want to be part of this crazy
family Nora's always talking about.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.826
This crazy family that's
so accepting and wonderful.

41:05.861 --> 41:07.762
Stop. Okay?

41:07.796 --> 41:08.996
Just stop.

41:09.031 --> 41:10.798
I'm not happy about this.

41:12.634 --> 41:14.001
I really hate surprises

41:14.036 --> 41:17.004
and this week has been full of them.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.740
But all the surprises
haven't been bad, so...

41:24.713 --> 41:25.680
Are you decent?

41:26.014 --> 41:27.048
Yes. I'm decent.

41:29.885 --> 41:32.920
So, uh, ready for school?
We need to get going.

41:32.954 --> 41:35.022
I can get Leo or Camille to take me.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.857
No. You don't have to.

41:36.892 --> 41:39.960
Let's just get things back to
normal around here, all right, sis?

41:39.995 --> 41:41.929
All right, bro. I'll be right there.

41:59.014 --> 42:01.949
Hey, it's me. Ginger.

42:01.983 --> 42:04.618
I knew you'd call me, toots.

42:04.653 --> 42:06.554
Those people aren't your family.

42:06.988 --> 42:07.988
I'm your family.
