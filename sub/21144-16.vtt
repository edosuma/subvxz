00:01.577 --> 00:02.726
Hey, guys! Bizaardvark here

00:02.728 --> 00:03.335
with our good friend, Amelia.

00:03.412 --> 00:05.671
Hey, y'all!

00:05.748 --> 00:06.338
And today we're gonna be showing
you guys how to make slime.

00:06.415 --> 00:08.156
Woo.

00:08.234 --> 00:08.990
Here's what you're gonna need:

00:09.068 --> 00:10.417
White glue, shavin' cream,

00:10.494 --> 00:14.496
your choice of food colorin'
and the magic ingredient,

00:14.573 --> 00:15.830
eye solution.

00:15.908 --> 00:17.683
First is glue, - Yes.

00:17.760 --> 00:18.742
So let's pour some glue in here.

00:18.744 --> 00:19.852
Just put in a bunch.

00:19.928 --> 00:22.170
- All: Ahhhhhhh!
- Frankie!

00:22.248 --> 00:23.408
So now we have glue as our base,

00:23.432 --> 00:24.581
let's add the color now.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.191
- I've got blue.
- What'd you get? Red?

00:26.268 --> 00:28.527
- Red.
- I'm gonna make a nice pastel.

00:28.604 --> 00:29.677
Okay, let's mix this.

00:29.755 --> 00:31.196
This is nice.

00:31.273 --> 00:32.756
This is really fun.

00:32.758 --> 00:35.534
- Now we have shaving cream.
- Wait one second.

00:35.611 --> 00:38.203
You're not... Uh! Uh! Uh!
Moving so fast!

00:38.280 --> 00:40.947
Wow, it... it looks really pretty.
It smells good, too.

00:41.024 --> 00:42.335
- I know, it smells really good.
- Oh, it does.

00:42.359 --> 00:43.709
You ready
to put in the solution?

00:43.786 --> 00:46.361
- All right, yeah.
- This is what makes it the slime.

00:46.438 --> 00:47.713
Okay.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.100
(gasp) Oh, my gosh, I can
see it already working.

00:49.124 --> 00:51.032
Aw, man!
It's getting all rubbery!

00:51.110 --> 00:52.943
(gasp)

00:52.945 --> 00:55.629
Ta-da! Here is our
finished slime!

00:55.705 --> 00:58.949
- Ahhhh!
- Ohhhh!

00:58.951 --> 01:00.019
- See if we can...?
- Here, ready?

01:00.043 --> 01:01.451
All: Slime jump rope!

01:01.453 --> 01:03.711
- (laughing)
- (buzzer)

01:03.789 --> 01:05.472
It doesn't work!

01:05.549 --> 01:06.899
- All: Slime slingshot!
- (buzzer)

01:06.975 --> 01:08.286
- It doesn't work!
- (all laughing)

01:08.310 --> 01:11.311
You look like a Santa Claus
dyed his beard purple.

01:11.388 --> 01:13.146
(bell)

01:13.223 --> 01:14.631
(gasp) We should put
all of them together.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.576
- Ahh!
- Ooh, it's a galaxy!

01:17.653 --> 01:18.653

All right, folks, looks like
it's time to play...

02:19.365 --> 02:21.756
"What's Wrong with Paige?"

02:24.052 --> 02:26.127
That was one of three sighs.

02:26.205 --> 02:28.296
Either she hated her lunch,

02:28.374 --> 02:30.207
something happened
to sea otters,

02:30.209 --> 02:31.892
or something's up with Reese.

02:31.968 --> 02:35.395
- Number three, Bob.
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

02:35.472 --> 02:37.564
Wait, what?

02:37.641 --> 02:38.715
What's going on with Reese?

02:38.717 --> 02:41.385
I thought you were
having fun with him?

02:41.387 --> 02:42.788
Every time you saw him
you showed that...

02:42.812 --> 02:44.496
weird emotion.

02:44.573 --> 02:45.739
- Joy?
- Yeah, joy.

02:47.576 --> 02:48.742
Well, not anymore.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.243
I mean, he used to be fun,

02:50.320 --> 02:53.230
but now he's so predictable
and boring.

02:53.232 --> 02:55.065
Hey, look. Here he comes.

02:55.067 --> 02:57.067
I guarantee he'll start off
with a bad joke,

02:57.069 --> 02:58.418
then he'll talk about soup,

02:58.495 --> 03:01.129
and then he'll say goodbye
with a horrible catch phrase.

03:03.258 --> 03:05.409
- Oh, hey Paige.
- Hey, Reese.

03:05.411 --> 03:06.501
What's up?

03:06.578 --> 03:07.686
The sky.

03:07.763 --> 03:10.022
Wow.

03:10.098 --> 03:11.378
Man, I wish
there was soup today.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.515
Wow!

03:14.844 --> 03:16.086
Nope. No soup.

03:16.088 --> 03:17.421
Bummer!

03:17.423 --> 03:18.647
Well, Reese ya later!

03:22.277 --> 03:23.685
- Did he just...?
- Yep.

03:23.762 --> 03:24.802
As if his name was a verb.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.616
I think it's time
to end things with Reese.

03:29.693 --> 03:31.930
Ooh, let me do it. Scale of one to
10, how much do you want him to cry?

03:31.954 --> 03:35.547
Frankie!
I have to do this myself.

03:35.624 --> 03:36.882
I'm gonna end it today.

03:36.959 --> 03:39.218
I'm proud of you, kid.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.202
Hey, Paige. Good news!
There is soup today!

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
Reese ya later!

03:43.966 --> 03:47.542
Both: Wow!

03:47.619 --> 03:49.179
By the way,
I am excited about the soup.

03:52.307 --> 03:54.399
Hey-hey! Who's excited
to meet a dinosaur?

03:54.476 --> 03:57.961
Bernie, the class is called
"Intro to Dinosaurs,"

03:57.963 --> 04:00.032
but you know you're not actually
gonna meet one, right?

04:00.056 --> 04:01.222
They're extinct.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.724
Not all of 'em.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.818
Say hello to Tyrannosaurus Flex.

04:06.805 --> 04:10.307
You signed up for this class just
to do that joke, didn't you?

04:10.309 --> 04:12.400
Yeah.
Plus I hear it's an easy "A",

04:12.478 --> 04:15.236
which we're gonna need, since
we're definitely not getting one

04:15.314 --> 04:16.474
in Coach Carlson's gym class.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.332
Too slow. You fail.

04:22.245 --> 04:23.503
Too sweaty! Fail.

04:26.325 --> 04:27.674
I hate your sneakers! You fail.

04:29.328 --> 04:32.220
Yeah. He's goin'
through some stuff.

04:34.758 --> 04:37.501
Who cares?
I'm pumped for this class.

04:37.503 --> 04:40.003
It's gonna be a wild,
dinosaur-fueled adventure.

04:40.005 --> 04:43.673
(slow and dull voice) Welcome
to "Intro to Dinosaurs."

04:43.675 --> 04:48.453
My name is Mr. Trifone, and I'd
like to start today's class

04:48.530 --> 04:51.865
by talking about
the Triassic Period.

04:51.941 --> 04:53.850
- What's going on?
- (yawns)

04:53.852 --> 04:57.945
His voice is like a lullaby.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.415
Can't... stay awake.

05:03.695 --> 05:05.095
Thought I was gonna
meet a dinosaur.

05:07.624 --> 05:10.142
The climate
during the Triassic Period

05:10.218 --> 05:14.295
was dry and warm.

05:14.373 --> 05:17.965
Except on the days
when it wasn't.

05:18.043 --> 05:21.478
Those days were less dry,
and less warm.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.720
- Where am I?
- You're in class.

05:30.722 --> 05:32.831
We slept through
the whole thing.

05:32.908 --> 05:34.741
Amelia, get in the hot tub.

05:34.818 --> 05:36.001
- (slap)
- What?

05:37.987 --> 05:44.343
Uhhh... Sorry. I was dreaming
you and I were in a...

05:44.419 --> 05:45.539
well, you heard what I said.

05:48.498 --> 05:49.848
What are we gonna do?

05:49.925 --> 05:51.219
This class was gonna be
our easy "A."

05:51.243 --> 05:54.244
How do we stay awake
with Professor Snoozeface?

05:54.246 --> 05:55.246
Is that really his name?

05:57.674 --> 05:59.354
I mean, it might be.
None of us were awake!

06:02.011 --> 06:03.451
You three are late for gym.
You fail!

06:05.607 --> 06:07.315
All: Awwww...

06:11.521 --> 06:13.187
So? Did you do it?

06:13.265 --> 06:14.539
Is it over?

06:14.616 --> 06:15.657
Did he cry?

06:18.437 --> 06:19.914
I talked to Reese
at the end of the day,

06:19.938 --> 06:21.771
and I told him what's what.

06:21.773 --> 06:23.882
So, how was your lunch today?

06:23.959 --> 06:27.001
The turkey was a little bland.
But nice.

06:28.947 --> 06:30.222
You didn't even bring it up?

06:30.298 --> 06:33.550
Nice, but bland, how much
clearer could I have been?

06:35.470 --> 06:37.545
- Sister, I hear ya.
- (sigh)

06:37.623 --> 06:39.623
You did great.
Although next time,

06:39.625 --> 06:43.560
you might wanna try using the words
"I want to break up with you."

06:45.631 --> 06:47.406
I can't.

06:47.482 --> 06:48.534
What if he thinks I'm mean?

06:48.558 --> 06:50.725
What if I scar him forever?

06:50.802 --> 06:54.413
What if I'm portrayed as the villain
in the movie of Reese's life?

06:54.489 --> 06:55.655
Good! More roles for women.

06:58.493 --> 07:00.568
(sigh) - Hey, what
can I do to help?

07:00.646 --> 07:03.905
I don't know. I just hate
that I'm not brave enough

07:03.982 --> 07:04.906
to break up with him.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.167
And that's how
you climb a skyscraper

07:07.243 --> 07:08.927
using only two plungers!

07:09.004 --> 07:10.503
Dare completed!

07:13.158 --> 07:15.008
Why didn't
I think of this before?

07:15.084 --> 07:16.993
Dirk is super brave.
Maybe he can help me.

07:16.995 --> 07:19.938
Cool. Because, it... it sounds
like this thing could've gotten

07:20.015 --> 07:22.089
real... emotional,

07:22.167 --> 07:23.683
and you know, feelings?

07:23.760 --> 07:24.760
Gross.

07:31.026 --> 07:32.842
Dirk?

07:32.844 --> 07:36.455
Could you teach me how to be brave
enough to break up with Reese?

07:36.531 --> 07:40.016
Reese? You mean that
boring guy who's so boring

07:40.018 --> 07:41.538
that he makes the word
"boring" boring?

07:43.205 --> 07:45.855
Yep, that's m'guy.

07:45.857 --> 07:49.951
Paige, it would be an honor
to help you with your problem.

07:50.028 --> 07:53.120
We'll do it the Dirk way!

07:53.198 --> 07:57.033
All right, Dare Me Bro, I'm ready for
whatever crazy physical training

07:57.035 --> 08:00.127
you've got...

08:00.205 --> 08:01.845
- Hello, Paige.
- (peaceful music playing)

08:01.890 --> 08:04.224
There will be
no physical training.

08:04.300 --> 08:08.636
To get to the root of your problem,
we must take a journey of the mind.

08:08.714 --> 08:12.139
Here we... grow.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.733
Spiritually.

08:17.723 --> 08:18.479
Hey, guys! I'm Fraige.

08:18.557 --> 08:19.906
I'm Pankie.

08:19.983 --> 08:22.058
Both: And we're... Bizaardfart!

08:22.060 --> 08:23.743
(fart noise)

08:23.820 --> 08:25.987
And that is how
not to introduce a video.

08:26.064 --> 08:29.007
Today, we're gonna teach you
how not to do a lot of things.

08:29.084 --> 08:30.008
In a segment we like to call...

08:30.085 --> 08:31.510
"How Not To."

08:31.586 --> 08:33.512
How not to make ice.

08:33.588 --> 08:36.330
- You just...
- It goes everywhere but... (gasp)

08:36.408 --> 08:38.517
- (singing) Chilling...
- Solid form...

08:38.593 --> 08:39.409
Both: Oooooh...
- (buzzer)

08:39.411 --> 08:41.520
How not to toast a bagel.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.913
Bagel? You are one heck
of a guy.

08:43.915 --> 08:44.915
Cheers.

08:46.175 --> 08:47.917
(buzzer)

08:47.919 --> 08:49.239
How not to build a house
of cards.

08:50.605 --> 08:51.605
(buzzer)

08:51.681 --> 08:52.681
Go fish.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.924
This is how not to put on
a sweater.

08:54.926 --> 08:56.701
Got some nice pantaloons.

08:56.778 --> 08:57.922
See, it's a nice
little hood here.

08:57.946 --> 08:59.353
Oh, no... Oh no!

08:59.431 --> 09:02.098
And that's how not to put on a sweater!
-(Buzzer)

09:02.100 --> 09:04.601
How not to solve a math problem.

09:04.603 --> 09:06.436
- All right, so, okay...
- Um, carry the one...

09:06.438 --> 09:08.271
- Okay, okay, subtract that.
- So here's our answer.

09:08.273 --> 09:09.047
We did it.

09:09.124 --> 09:11.716
- (bell)
- Please subscribe.

09:11.793 --> 09:12.920
It's down below.
I drew an arrow.

09:12.944 --> 09:13.793
Right there. It's not that hard.

09:13.870 --> 09:14.961
Subscribe!

09:15.038 --> 09:16.038
Ahhhh!

09:19.618 --> 09:22.710
Dirk, what is all this stuff?

09:22.788 --> 09:26.456
Please...
call me Zenmaster Brah.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.550
And welcome to my "dojah."

09:29.628 --> 09:33.405
Oh. Thank "yah." (laughs)

09:33.481 --> 09:34.481
What does that mean?

09:36.484 --> 09:38.392
Today, we will get
to the root of your fears

09:38.470 --> 09:39.819
and conquer them.

09:39.896 --> 09:43.081
It will take us many hours.
Please, stand right there.

09:44.492 --> 09:46.367
Uhh... okay.

09:48.146 --> 09:49.996
Just stand?

09:50.073 --> 09:51.405
Right here? Am I doing it right?

09:51.483 --> 09:53.443
Do you want me to sit?
I'm really good at sitting.

09:55.487 --> 09:57.320
- And, we're done.
- What?

09:57.322 --> 10:00.323
You said many hours.

10:00.325 --> 10:03.321
Your excessive questions provided me with
information I needed to give you my...

10:03.345 --> 10:06.420
Dare-ignosis.

10:06.498 --> 10:08.514
So just, "dare"
plus "diagnosis"?

10:08.591 --> 10:10.442
Pretty much.

10:10.518 --> 10:13.594
Paige, you overthink things,

10:13.672 --> 10:16.506
creating questions
that have no answers.

10:16.508 --> 10:18.691
And in the absence of answers,
you feel fear.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.027
You're right.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.846
I totally do that.

10:22.848 --> 10:26.625
I... I remember the first time my
mom took me on a roller coaster.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.943
The whole way up
I couldn't stop thinking

10:29.020 --> 10:31.020
about everything
that could go wrong.

10:31.022 --> 10:32.789
I got so scared,
I made them stop the ride.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.020
Haven't been
on a roller coaster since.

10:36.044 --> 10:37.293
Wow.

10:39.214 --> 10:42.031
That was a long story.

10:42.033 --> 10:43.290
Okay. So we got this.

10:43.368 --> 10:46.311
So how's this gonna help me
break up with Reese?

10:46.388 --> 10:50.390
Fear not. I have the answer.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.225
You must learn to do, not think.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.138
(loud gong)

10:57.215 --> 11:00.566
Aah! That was so much louder
than I thought it was gonna be!

11:00.643 --> 11:01.776
What?

11:07.075 --> 11:09.409
Listen up, men!
Our grade is on the line.

11:09.485 --> 11:13.338
Mr. Trifone has the most
relaxing voice in the world.

11:13.415 --> 11:16.007
But today we are prepared.
And we will stay awake!

11:19.829 --> 11:26.167
Hello, class. Today, we'll be covering
the long and exciting history

11:26.244 --> 11:28.335
of the triceratops.

11:28.413 --> 11:31.189
I'm sorry...
I'm not strong enough.

11:33.418 --> 11:34.418
Tell Amelia she loves me.

11:36.421 --> 11:39.180
Bernie, no! Use your weapons!

11:39.257 --> 11:42.200
Fun fact
about the triceratops...

11:42.277 --> 11:44.369
(bangs on desk)

11:45.931 --> 11:46.931
I'm up!

11:48.357 --> 11:49.949
(yawns)

11:50.026 --> 11:51.026
(horn honks)

11:52.771 --> 11:56.289
Not today, Dr. Snoozerman.

11:56.365 --> 12:00.443
There are so many kinds
of dinosaurs.

12:00.445 --> 12:04.172
The stegosaurus.
The brontosaurus.

12:06.785 --> 12:07.842
Huh!

12:10.546 --> 12:12.805
The the-saurus.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.715
(chuckles)

12:14.793 --> 12:16.642
I'm kidding, of course.

12:16.719 --> 12:18.737
A little dinosaur humor.

12:21.299 --> 12:24.650
I'm fading! Call for back up!

12:24.727 --> 12:26.636
Send in the bratty kids!

12:26.638 --> 12:32.233
(clattering noises)

12:32.310 --> 12:33.879
Guys! We did it, we're
gonna ace this cla...

12:33.903 --> 12:36.329
(Bernie snoring)

12:37.999 --> 12:40.908
No, I dreamt the whole thing!

12:40.986 --> 12:43.653
What happened to our
stay-awake plan?

12:43.655 --> 12:46.422
You fell asleep right after I
asked what was in the box?

12:48.159 --> 12:52.495
Sorry, Mr. Trifone. You're
probably really mad at us, huh?

12:52.497 --> 12:54.272
No. This isn't your fault.

12:54.349 --> 12:56.090
This has happened to me before.

12:56.167 --> 13:00.761
I've been fired from every
school I've ever taught at.

13:00.839 --> 13:02.522
If I could change one thing
about myself...

13:02.598 --> 13:05.024
Sorry, you were sad?
I mean... saying?

13:06.678 --> 13:10.455
All I've ever wanted
was to help people.

13:10.532 --> 13:12.957
Maybe with this voice,
it's just not possible.

13:18.356 --> 13:21.800
Aw... that was so
boring and sad.

13:25.030 --> 13:28.381
We need to help this sad man
keep his job.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.809
What's that, wife Amelia?

13:30.885 --> 13:32.045
You wanna get in the hot tub?

13:34.556 --> 13:37.540
What do you mean
the heater's not working?

13:37.542 --> 13:38.799
Did you call the guy?

13:38.877 --> 13:39.934
Call the guy!

13:45.717 --> 13:48.067
Welcome!
To the emotional gauntlet!

13:50.889 --> 13:52.572
Horse Face Guy, you had one job!

13:54.483 --> 13:56.501
(gong)

13:59.914 --> 14:03.324
Paige, your objective
is to take this ball

14:03.401 --> 14:05.677
with Reese's face on it,
and dump him in the trash.

14:05.753 --> 14:09.163
On the gauntlet, you will face
obstacles that represent your fears

14:09.240 --> 14:11.165
about breaking up with Reese.

14:11.242 --> 14:12.166
Dirk are you sure
I'm ready for this?

14:12.243 --> 14:13.852
I have faith in you.

14:13.928 --> 14:16.929
Don't think... just do.

14:19.767 --> 14:20.933
Let the gauntlet begin.

14:25.757 --> 14:26.917
(high-pitched voice)
I'm Reese's mom.

14:26.941 --> 14:28.591
You're all my son has.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.943
Please don't break up with him.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.331
I... I... I don't wanna hurt
your son.

14:32.355 --> 14:33.596
I guess we can stay together?

14:33.598 --> 14:36.115
(air horn, penalty beeps)

14:36.192 --> 14:38.209
Don't think!
You're in your head too much!

14:38.286 --> 14:40.453
Okay! Sorry, Reese's mom!

14:44.125 --> 14:46.551
(gruff voice) I'm Future Reese.

14:46.628 --> 14:48.127
You broke up with me
20 years ago

14:48.204 --> 14:50.129
and I still haven't recovered.

14:50.206 --> 14:51.516
No, I... I don't wanna
ruin your life.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.225
Dirk: My life wouldn't be
ruined if you were in it.

14:54.302 --> 14:56.636
Aww. You mean that?

14:56.712 --> 14:58.379
Of course, baby.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.881
You're my everything.

15:00.959 --> 15:02.959
(air horn, penalty beeps)

15:02.961 --> 15:04.977
Paige! What are you doing?

15:05.054 --> 15:06.145
I don't know!

15:09.300 --> 15:10.816
Dirk: I'm Reese's broken heart!

15:10.893 --> 15:11.893
Not fallin' for it!

15:13.154 --> 15:16.247
Dirk: I'm Reese's liver. The
heart was my best friend

15:16.324 --> 15:17.731
and now my heart is broken.

15:17.809 --> 15:19.533
That doesn't make medical sense!

15:22.830 --> 15:25.406
I deserve to be happy!

15:25.483 --> 15:27.316
I'm breaking up with you, Reese!

15:27.318 --> 15:29.594
(electronic beeping)

15:29.671 --> 15:33.156
Paige!
You completed the gauntlet!

15:33.158 --> 15:35.841
By the way, it was me
doing all the voices.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.177
I didn't think! I just acted!

15:38.254 --> 15:41.681
Now when I see Reese, I'll be able
to break up with him for real!

15:41.757 --> 15:43.924
I'm glad you feel that way.

15:44.002 --> 15:45.109
Because I invited him here.

15:45.186 --> 15:46.352
What?

15:46.429 --> 15:48.354
Hey, Paige!

15:48.431 --> 15:50.506
Reese! Hey!

15:50.508 --> 15:52.358
Uhh... We were just
talkin' about you!

15:52.435 --> 15:53.859
Yeah, we were.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.580
Well, Dirk said you have
something important to tell me.

15:55.604 --> 15:58.239
Uh... I do.

16:02.537 --> 16:03.537
Reese?

16:06.040 --> 16:09.025
I think we should take our
relationship to the next level.

16:09.027 --> 16:10.187
Wanna go to the school dance?

16:11.620 --> 16:13.029
Sounds great.

16:13.031 --> 16:14.305
I'll wear my new suit.

16:14.382 --> 16:16.140
It's very plain.

16:17.960 --> 16:22.981
- What happened?
- I don't know. What's wrong with me?

16:23.057 --> 16:24.482
Why am I such a scaredy cat?

16:26.211 --> 16:27.376
(sigh) I'm just so tired

16:27.378 --> 16:30.896
of being on this emotional
roller coaster.

16:30.973 --> 16:33.825
Emotional roller coaster,
you say?

16:33.901 --> 16:35.218
Yeah, I literally
just said that.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.235
Why'd you say it slower?

16:38.223 --> 16:40.981
Dirk? Where am I?

16:41.059 --> 16:42.491
We're at the end
of your journey.

16:44.912 --> 16:49.398
Ohhh... Ohh... Oh!
A roller coaster?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.567
And not the emotional kind!
The backwards kind!

16:51.569 --> 16:53.736
(screams)

16:53.738 --> 16:55.738
That's so much worse!

16:55.740 --> 16:58.299
(screams)

16:59.927 --> 17:01.410
Hey, guys!
Paige and Frankie here

17:01.412 --> 17:05.431
with our friends, Bernie,
Amelia, Dirk and Horse Face Guy.

17:05.508 --> 17:06.910
Today, we're gonna be playing
"Pass the Dance."

17:06.934 --> 17:10.419
We'll each take turns
doin' our favorite dance move,

17:10.421 --> 17:13.865
then the next person has to do all of the
dance moves of the people before them.

17:13.941 --> 17:15.258
And add their own.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.352
What if we can't remember
the dance moves?

17:18.429 --> 17:19.353
I'm asking for a friend.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.854
If you can't remember,
you're out.

17:20.932 --> 17:22.098
I... I mean, your friend is.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.374
Coo, coo coo, coo coo, coo.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.246
- Paige? Pass the dance.
- (dance music playing)

17:25.270 --> 17:27.361
All right.

17:27.438 --> 17:28.880
- Oh.
- Oh!

17:28.956 --> 17:30.606
(bell)

17:30.608 --> 17:32.041
- Ooh, ho!
- Ohhh!

17:34.612 --> 17:35.702
(bell)

17:35.780 --> 17:36.879
All righty.

17:40.802 --> 17:41.802
- Yeah.
- (bell)

17:43.045 --> 17:44.453
- What is...?
- What?

17:44.455 --> 17:45.455
Fancy.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.293
(bell)

17:50.295 --> 17:51.310
- Okay.
- Ohhhh!

17:53.147 --> 17:54.147
Oh, okay.

17:54.223 --> 17:56.148
All right.

17:56.225 --> 17:58.467
- Oh, wow, that was good.
- Woooo!

17:58.469 --> 18:00.244
- No!
- (buzzer)

18:00.321 --> 18:01.913
- Noooo!
- You're out!

18:01.989 --> 18:04.398
(shouting)

18:04.475 --> 18:05.475
Paige, I can't do that!

18:07.312 --> 18:08.661
(buzzer)

18:11.649 --> 18:13.089
It's getting hard.
It's getting hard.

18:15.169 --> 18:16.260
- Oh!
- (shouting)

18:16.337 --> 18:17.337
(buzzer)

18:18.823 --> 18:19.989
Whoa!

18:19.991 --> 18:21.173
Ohhh!

18:21.250 --> 18:22.250
(bell)

18:27.332 --> 18:28.589
- You're out!
- (buzzer)

18:28.666 --> 18:31.275
- I didn't know this was a dance move.
- (laughing)

18:35.764 --> 18:38.599
- Oh! Snap!
- (shouting)

18:38.676 --> 18:40.952
How's he gonna do that?

18:41.028 --> 18:42.845
- (laughing)
- (bell)

18:42.847 --> 18:44.238
- Ooh.
- Ohh!

18:46.108 --> 18:47.850
- (buzzer)
- Yeah!

18:47.852 --> 18:49.443
- (shouting)
- Dirk: That's my boy!

18:49.520 --> 18:50.628
Bernie: I am the champion!

18:50.705 --> 18:52.121
- Yeah!
- Yes!

18:56.285 --> 18:59.211
- (screams)
- Wooooo!

18:59.288 --> 19:02.298
I feel like we're screaming
for different reasons!

19:05.127 --> 19:07.478
Paige, if you could face
your biggest fear,

19:07.555 --> 19:09.129
you could do anything.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.540
Even break up with Reese.

19:11.542 --> 19:15.060
You have until we reach the top
to tell me to stop this ride.

19:15.137 --> 19:16.712
How much higher are we going?

19:16.714 --> 19:19.565
Many. Moons. Higher.

19:19.642 --> 19:22.160
This coaster is called
"The Death Maker."

19:22.236 --> 19:25.329
"The Death Maker"?
It makes death?

19:25.406 --> 19:27.156
Hey, how'd you know the slogan?

19:29.894 --> 19:30.334
Dirk, I... I... I... I don't
think I can do this.

19:30.411 --> 19:33.562
Yes, you can.

19:33.564 --> 19:36.248
You must be this tall
to ride the ride.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.158
Spiritually.

19:38.236 --> 19:40.997
You can't just keep saying "spiritually"
and think it means something!

19:42.240 --> 19:46.242
Dirk, I... I... I don't need
Zenmaster Brah right now.

19:46.244 --> 19:47.927
I need you to be my friend.

19:48.003 --> 19:50.579
I am your friend, Paige.

19:50.581 --> 19:53.416
Do you know why
I became Dare Me Bro?

19:53.418 --> 19:56.861
Because when I was younger,
I was afraid of everything.

19:56.938 --> 19:58.863
I couldn't even leave my room.

19:58.940 --> 20:03.943
And then one day I just dared
myself to face my fears.

20:04.019 --> 20:05.686
You were afraid?

20:05.763 --> 20:09.189
But... But you're so brave.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.358
It's okay to think
about how hard something is.

20:11.436 --> 20:15.120
Bravery is doing it anyway.

20:15.197 --> 20:18.624
Paige... you can do this.

20:18.701 --> 20:21.794
I dare you to face your fears.

20:27.618 --> 20:28.726
Dare accepted.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.636
Here we go!

20:30.713 --> 20:32.396
- (Paige screams)
- Whoaaaaaa!

20:37.812 --> 20:41.797
Mr. Trifone, great news. We borrowed
a speaker system from the AV Club

20:41.799 --> 20:43.574
to help amplify your voice.

20:43.651 --> 20:45.910
Now your students
will never fall asleep again!

20:45.987 --> 20:48.061
And you can give us all "A" s!

20:48.139 --> 20:51.991
For caring and whatnot!

20:52.067 --> 20:55.920
I appreciate that,
but I actually quit teaching.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.904
I got a job
at a sleep therapy company.

20:57.982 --> 21:02.927
I'll be recording my voice
to help people fall asleep.

21:03.004 --> 21:04.420
(hits floor)

21:06.415 --> 21:08.382
You're going to be
very successful.

21:15.016 --> 21:16.849
Frankie! I did it!
I faced my fears

21:16.925 --> 21:18.667
and rode the Death Maker!

21:18.669 --> 21:20.945
Great. I've been asking you
to go on the Death Maker

21:21.022 --> 21:23.430
for three months, but sure,

21:23.508 --> 21:26.933
go on with Zen Master McManbun.

21:27.011 --> 21:30.696
Hey, if you makes you feel any
better, I threw up on him a lot.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.123
Yeah, it does.

21:34.777 --> 21:38.278
But now I am finally ready
to end things with Reese.

21:38.356 --> 21:40.581
Oh, there he is. Good luck.

21:43.452 --> 21:45.597
Listen, Reese, there's something
I've been meaning to...

21:45.621 --> 21:48.288
I think we should break up.

21:48.366 --> 21:49.698
I'm sorry, what?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.884
I've been wanting to do it
for a while now,

21:51.960 --> 21:53.719
I just didn't know how.

21:53.796 --> 21:56.555
I was hoping you'd
end things with me first.

21:56.632 --> 21:57.868
That's why I've been
acting so boring lately.

21:57.892 --> 22:01.544
I'm sorry, what?

22:01.546 --> 22:04.046
Come on, I made a bad joke
every day.

22:04.048 --> 22:05.639
All I talked about was soup.

22:05.716 --> 22:08.067
I even said, "Reese you later."

22:08.143 --> 22:09.143
What more do you need?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.080
Sorry, I hope we can...
still be friends?

22:14.892 --> 22:15.892
Yeah.

22:19.397 --> 22:21.321
You okay?

22:21.399 --> 22:23.341
Was I wrong about Reese?

22:23.417 --> 22:24.617
Should I try and get him back?

22:24.660 --> 22:25.793
Should I hired a skywriter?

22:27.922 --> 22:30.589
I love you.
You're gonna be fine.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.332
I think we just need
to do something

22:32.410 --> 22:33.410
that'll clear your head.

22:35.913 --> 22:37.355
Why do I keep falling for this?

22:37.431 --> 22:42.901
- Whoaaaaa!
- (Paige screams)
