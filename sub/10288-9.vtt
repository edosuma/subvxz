04:29.236 --> 04:31.500
...kissing a nice woman

04:32.372 --> 04:35.569
You know, that woman's husband
is one of Danny's superiors.

04:35.742 --> 04:39.474
And that puts Danny
in a very compromising position.

what “compromising“ means?

- This took so long, I'm frightened.
- Oh, don't worry, Mrs. Blake.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.240
I have a feeling
we're about to see some magic.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.406
The State finds the defendant guilty
as charged.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.851
Ta-da.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.313
The fine is $200.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.619
This court will suspend that until such time
as the defendant can defray restitution.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.387
What about all our stuff?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.462
The court also holds for the plaintiff...

13:51.631 --> 13:53.395
...and forbids the defendant entry...

13:53.566 --> 13:57.127
...until the said plaintiff's eviction
proceedings are dismissed.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.368
God, I love this country.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.508
I am sorry.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.907
I did everything I could.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.707
I did my best.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.577
Are we going to jail?

14:13.753 --> 14:16.484
No, of course you're not going to jail.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.124
Then where are we going
to stay tonight?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.421
It's cold tonight.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.359
This way, please.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.471

- Hi.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.154
- Is Judge Stone in yet?
- Yeah, he's been here for almost an hour.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.698
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

15:35.301 --> 15:38.635
- Why?
- Well, he's not in the best of moods.

15:38.805 --> 15:39.966
Mac, I can imagine.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.006
That was an awful session
he had last night.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.043
I just thought I'd go in there
and cheer him up a little bit.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.883
I arranged it, I did the paperwork...

16:28.054 --> 16:30.352
...I made the phone calls,
I drove you down there.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.153
But it was my blood.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.793

Hi, sir. You look like hell.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.191
How much sleep you get last night,
five, 10 minutes?

17:08.828 --> 17:11.819
I couldn't get them
out of my mind all night.

17:11.998 --> 17:15.366
I just kept hearing that kid call me a pig.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.336
It's probably because they were out
sleeping in your alley.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.438
[LAUGHS]

17:23.309 --> 17:25.641
I'm kidding.
You realize how many alleys there are?

17:25.810 --> 17:29.304
The odds of them
of actually choosing yours.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.153
Your Honor, what happened to that woman
and her son was not your fault.

17:35.321 --> 17:38.154
You had no choice.
You had to rule that way.

17:39.225 --> 17:44.061
I actually heard him calling me “pig.“

17:44.230 --> 17:49.794

...when a tornado leveled
the diner he washed dishes at.

It also destroyed
the adjoining trailer park.

Our camper was in stall six.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.426
It wasn't much.
