out of control.

15:09.361 --> 15:11.361
I'm sorry.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.161
OK.

15:19.681 --> 15:21.681
Hmm.

15:40.201 --> 15:42.501
Your colleague found the chassis
on the roof of the bank.

15:42.601 --> 15:43.981
Right.

15:44.081 --> 15:47.181
The van was a white Mitsubishi,
1983 model. 19 years old.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.101
They chiselled off the numbers

15:49.201 --> 15:51.021
so we can't identify
its registration.

a lot of them in pieces.

it's coming in tonight.

16:12.921 --> 16:14.701
I've got parents contacting MPs

16:14.801 --> 16:16.101
complaining
they're being stopped

16:16.201 --> 16:18.661
from bringing their children
home for burial.

16:18.761 --> 16:20.901
We have a body here

16:21.001 --> 16:25.741
that has been claimed by four
separate families as their son,

16:25.841 --> 16:28.021
because it's intact,

16:28.121 --> 16:30.581
because the alternative's
too hard to bear.

it's stressful over there.

16:33.321 --> 16:36.641

a tour of the Sari Club site.

16:37.801 --> 16:40.581
Right, that's a stupid idea.
It's not safe.

We have to assume the terrorists
are gonna strike again.

16:43.521 --> 16:45.141

16:45.241 --> 16:47.021
We lock everyone
in their rooms at night.

16:47.121 --> 16:48.821
Well, that's not
your call to make.

16:48.921 --> 16:50.701

Australia and Indonesia

16:50.801 --> 16:52.461
showing unity in the sign-off.

Can you tell me

17:00.721 --> 17:02.301
why the Americans

17:02.401 --> 17:04.461
closed the doors
of their embassy

17:04.561 --> 17:06.601
three weeks before the bombings?

17:08.921 --> 17:11.141
They were concerned
about security.

17:11.241 --> 17:14.181
And do we know
who or what in particular

17:14.281 --> 17:16.281
they were concerned about?

17:16.641 --> 17:18.641
Have you got
any intelligence on that?

17:20.001 --> 17:22.301
Nothing that will help you
do your job.

he has to wait.

17:27.841 --> 17:30.981

a bomb vehicle and a head.

who the terrorists are, OK?

I can do it.

I need to walk.

she's ever had.

Mukhlas.

He's head of JI,
South-East Asia,

24:02.720 --> 24:05.020
but, uh, based in Indonesia.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.820
So Mukhlas trained with bin
Laden's fighters in Afghanistan.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.780
He's a protégé
of Abu Bakar Bashir.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.780
He's a committed terrorist

24:14.880 --> 24:18.380

of the operation.

-Thank you.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.040
I just had an idea.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.860
That we could use technology

24:45.960 --> 24:48.540
to throw a net
around the conspirators.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.620
It's the same way that they
tracked down Pablo Escobar.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.660
But to do it, we would need
to get some equipment

24:54.760 --> 24:56.060
from the Australian military.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.700
How big is
this military equipment?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.280

in the back of a ute.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.860
To achieve this,

25:03.960 --> 25:07.440
we're gonna need to get
our hands on Amrozi's phone.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.320
-MICK: Are you OK?
-Yeah.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.240
I just, uh, get flashes
sometimes, you know.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.780
I just try and block it out.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.500
Yeah, I focus on the present.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.180
Let's go. Come on.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.280
Mate, you might be overdoing it.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.220
Well, I gotta be
match-fit, Mick.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.480
You got picked?

30:12.760 --> 30:14.580
He's playing me
in the seconds, but yeah.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.660
Oh, well, new coach
gotta prove himself.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.960
-Not gonna be any favours.
-Not asking for any. Let's go.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
ASHTON: Pak.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.540
Uh, I may have been
a bit abrasive

30:29.640 --> 30:31.680
over that Amrozi business.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.540
Next time, don't let my officers
know what you're thinking.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.020
Point taken.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.860
The good thing is that
going public with the arrest

30:39.960 --> 30:41.340
seems to have had some results.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.059
So, shortly after
the interview was screened,

30:43.159 --> 30:44.819
there was a flurry of calls

30:44.919 --> 30:47.819
on monitored devices across
Java, Thailand, Malaysia.

30:47.919 --> 30:50.819
So, you know, JI seems to be
in a bit of a panic.

30:50.919 --> 30:52.819
-One of them was Mukhlas?
-Yeah.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.019
He's been on and off
his phone all morning.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.299
We've been tracking him.

30:56.399 --> 30:58.059
-Mere been informed?
-Yes.

30:58.159 --> 31:00.159
LYDIA: We've got a position
on Mukhlas.

31:02.239 --> 31:04.579
-Where is he?
-He's south of Kepanjen.

31:04.679 --> 31:06.419
I'll relay his position to Mere.

31:06.519 --> 31:08.659
Our technicians are trying to
track the person he's calling.

31:08.759 --> 31:10.059
Great.

31:25.479 --> 31:28.499
MERE: Mukhlas! Polisi! Polisi!

-(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

31:46.999 --> 31:49.059
NEWSREADER: As much as
this investigation

31:49.159 --> 31:51.899
has been frustrating for
Australian Federal Police,

31:51.999 --> 31:54.059
at least now
Indonesian authorities

31:54.159 --> 31:55.739
seem to be making real progress

31:55.839 --> 31:57.619
in the hunt
for those responsible.

31:57.719 --> 32:00.899
More arrests are expected
in the coming days.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.979
Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron,

32:03.079 --> 32:05.139
built the second part
of the massive bomb

32:05.239 --> 32:06.939
which tore apart the Sari Club.

32:07.039 --> 32:09.259
The group who masterminded
the attack

32:09.359 --> 32:13.199
would meet here
in darkness and in secrecy.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.779
It's just as they left it.

32:20.879 --> 32:22.339
We're gonna need
to take some samples

32:22.439 --> 32:24.539
before everyone comes
walking through here.

32:24.639 --> 32:26.959

32:30.999 --> 32:33.639
-ROYDS: Oh, my God.
-What?

32:35.799 --> 32:37.739
Someone's drawn the bomb design
on this paper,

32:37.839 --> 32:40.139
and they've left a bloody
boot print on the back of it.

32:40.239 --> 32:42.239
(CHUCKLES)

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Well...

33:06.239 --> 33:07.859
..that could well be true.

33:07.959 --> 33:09.959
But he knows who it was.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.959
Imron.

33:36.879 --> 33:38.939
ASHTON: Huh.

33:39.039 --> 33:40.579
Well.

33:40.679 --> 33:43.579
This is a will

33:43.679 --> 33:45.739
written by one of
the suicide bombers

33:45.839 --> 33:47.459
with a note to his mother.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.559
Undelivered.

34:19.359 --> 34:21.179
PASTIKA:
Samudra is a JI hardliner

34:21.279 --> 34:24.599
who taught at a JI school
in Malaysia run by Bashir.

34:25.879 --> 34:27.859
-We're closer to the top.
-ASHTON: Yeah.

34:27.959 --> 34:31.739
So we have Samudra, who is
the recruiter and commander.

34:31.839 --> 34:34.459
We have Mukhlas, fighter.

34:34.559 --> 34:37.419
Amrozi, Imron, foot soldiers.

34:37.519 --> 34:39.099
Suicide bombers.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.619
What are we missing?

34:40.719 --> 34:43.379
About 900 kilos
of potassium chlorate.

34:43.479 --> 34:46.579
Imron says
it all went into the van.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.899
Not possible - if that was
a 1,000-kilo bomb,

34:48.999 --> 34:51.899
the crater would be
24 metres across, not 4.

34:51.999 --> 34:56.819
Right, if Samudra has
the rest of those explosives,

34:56.919 --> 35:00.939
we have a real
and significant problem.

35:01.039 --> 35:02.739
ROYDS: But who's
he working with?

35:02.839 --> 35:05.539
I mean, whoever mixed and
designed and wired that bomb

35:05.639 --> 35:07.659
had to be some kind
of engineer or scientist.

35:07.759 --> 35:09.139
None of them
have that background.

35:09.239 --> 35:11.339
Well, al-Qaeda
have online manuals.

35:11.439 --> 35:13.559
And they also train bombmakers.

-Yep. Yep.

a tough match, mate.

to stay in the eight.

keep coming away.

never gonna happen.

how I'll go.

37:45.639 --> 37:48.179

with Gede.

37:48.279 --> 37:51.419
That is all that remains?

37:51.519 --> 37:53.539
We think Gede was at the van,

37:53.639 --> 37:57.439
asking the driver to move on
when the bomb was detonated.

38:18.239 --> 38:20.959
We searched and searched.

38:23.239 --> 38:26.679

to match with Gede's DNA.

As random as the US and its

42:33.318 --> 42:36.258
So the target was always
innocent civilians.

42:36.358 --> 42:39.338
They're not innocent.
They bring filth to our land.

42:39.438 --> 42:42.938

they indulge in sex,

exploded,

43:21.638 --> 43:23.638
and the rest just burnt off?

43:28.518 --> 43:30.258
You must have wired it wrongly.

43:33.278 --> 43:34.618

43:47.358 --> 43:49.358
You're a strategist.

43:49.998 --> 43:51.538
You're not an engineer.

43:51.638 --> 43:55.938
Did Abu Bakar Bashir
supply the bombmaker?

43:56.038 --> 43:59.538

He's not a fighter.

43:59.638 --> 44:03.038
Yeah. But he gave you
his blessing.

44:04.758 --> 44:06.758
I mean, who created that bomb?

44:13.878 --> 44:17.838
Alright. I understand.

44:18.958 --> 44:20.898
You're proud of what you did.

44:20.998 --> 44:23.138
And honour is important.
I get it.

44:23.238 --> 44:26.478
I mean, I'd feel the same,
you know.

44:27.878 --> 44:29.818
This is a picture of my boy.

44:29.918 --> 44:32.818
First moment I held
that little bugger in my arms,

44:32.918 --> 44:35.618
I knew I had to be
a good role model.

44:35.718 --> 44:39.618
I know you've got
a boy too, Imam.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.758
Who's going to look after
that boy now?

44:44.118 --> 44:48.298
And what about all those boys
at the Jemaah Islamiyah schools?

44:48.398 --> 44:50.478
What are they thinking
right now?

44:52.998 --> 44:57.378
You killed or maimed,
you know, 400 people,

44:57.478 --> 44:59.498
a lot of them on holidays.

44:59.598 --> 45:03.558
But then you got caught.
That's a failure, isn't it?

45:04.718 --> 45:06.138
I haven't failed.

45:06.238 --> 45:09.378
You. The West.
It's you who failed.

45:09.478 --> 45:11.298
Look at the hypocrisy.

45:11.398 --> 45:16.858
You spend billions on arms,
invent medicines to save lives,

45:16.958 --> 45:18.618
and then drop bombs to end them.

45:18.718 --> 45:21.138
The hypocrisy of the West

45:21.238 --> 45:23.018
is what brought chaos on Earth.

45:23.118 --> 45:26.578
And now the West has had a
taste of what chaos feels like.

45:26.678 --> 45:29.938
-That's not failure.
-Imam, you're right.

45:30.038 --> 45:32.018
The world's full of
contradictions,

45:32.118 --> 45:34.898
and hypocrisy is everywhere,
isn't it?

45:34.998 --> 45:39.718
I mean...hypocrisy's everywhere.

45:42.438 --> 45:43.778
But here's the thing.

45:43.878 --> 45:45.898
We need the name of
the bombmaker and you need...

45:45.998 --> 45:48.698
-I need nothing.
-I'm worried about your boy.

45:48.798 --> 45:51.458
Because he's gonna inherit
your reputation.

45:51.558 --> 45:54.538
I have taught him well.
He is a pure-minded boy.

45:54.638 --> 45:57.578
I'm sure he is, and I'm sure
he looks up to you.

45:57.678 --> 46:00.158
And I'm sure you want it
to stay that way.

46:01.158 --> 46:02.978
Am I right?

46:03.078 --> 46:06.978
They tell me you're a real
computer whiz. Is that right?

46:07.078 --> 46:09.598
I don't know anything
about these things.

46:11.438 --> 46:13.438
Not my territory.

I mean, I-I don't give a damn

46:42.918 --> 46:45.618
about your secret desires,
but I think you do.

46:45.718 --> 46:46.818
Turn it off.

46:46.918 --> 46:48.458
ASHTON: If this goes public,

46:48.558 --> 46:52.258
your bomb crew,
the JI boys, your son,

46:52.358 --> 46:54.458
everybody is gonna know

46:54.558 --> 46:56.858
that you're not the man
you pretend to be.

46:56.958 --> 46:58.898
PASTIKA: The bombmaker
was in Thailand,

46:58.998 --> 47:00.858
and you met him again in April.

47:00.958 --> 47:02.958
You see, we know.

47:04.598 --> 47:06.598
Just confirm his name.

47:07.078 --> 47:08.978
ASHTON: The man who recruits
suicide bombers

47:09.078 --> 47:11.698
is a porn addict

47:11.798 --> 47:14.338
who didn't even send
a kid's will to his parents.

47:14.438 --> 47:16.258
That's not gonna look good,
Imam.

47:16.358 --> 47:18.978
It's gonna look like
you got a kid to do something

47:19.078 --> 47:22.498
that you weren't prepared
to do yourself.

47:22.598 --> 47:24.918
How's your son
gonna feel about that?

47:32.678 --> 47:34.978
Right, that's it. I'm done.

47:35.078 --> 47:37.078
I'm gonna talk to the press.

(DOOR OPENS)

47:42.598 --> 47:44.598
He goes by many names.

47:45.838 --> 47:47.998
I know him as Dr Azahari.

47:49.518 --> 47:51.098
But you're not gonna get him.

47:51.198 --> 47:53.698
And next time,
he will hit closer to home.

COMMENTATOR: What a moment
this is, for not only Australia,

48:31.078 --> 48:34.338
not only for AFL football,
but for the free world as well.

48:34.438 --> 48:37.298
This shows that terrorism
will never beat courage.

48:37.398 --> 48:39.498
Welcome back indeed,
Jason McCartney.

48:39.598 --> 48:41.538
An inspiration to all.

Penetrating kick inside the 50.

48:43.518 --> 48:47.318
McCartney behind!
McCartney has taken the mark.

48:49.398 --> 48:51.378
Jason McCartney

48:51.478 --> 48:53.338
knows how to kick them.
