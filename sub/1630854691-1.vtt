WEBVTT

00:54.097 --> 00:56.708
They don't like it
when her shot is late.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.232
No, I understand.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.929
But because I'm new

00:59.929 --> 01:02.714
and taking over
for Dr. Stevens,

01:02.714 --> 01:06.022
it's just hard to believe
this is my patient.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.893
<i>I mean, the file is so thick,
I assumed she was elderly.</i>

01:07.893 --> 01:09.852
She's 47,

01:09.852 --> 01:11.201
she is your patient,

01:11.201 --> 01:14.378
and she needs
her Thorazine shot now.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.561
Before I give her
her shot,

01:23.561 --> 01:26.477
I really should
review her file.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.711
Where did he go,

02:26.711 --> 02:28.148
<i>the--the man</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:29.714
that was just talking to her?

02:30.889 --> 02:32.239
What man?

02:37.026 --> 02:39.550
I need a moment alone
with my patient...

02:39.550 --> 02:40.856
please.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.355
<i>What happened to you?</i>

03:48.315 --> 03:51.579
I can taste
those martinis from here.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.798
I'm trying a new gin
from Japan.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.235
Oh.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.370
I was telling
the Uber man about you.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.980
- Oh, yeah?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

04:01.980 --> 04:04.896
And he said,
if she's such a fancy doctor,

04:04.896 --> 04:07.464
why does she live on a boat
like a dropout?

04:07.464 --> 04:10.380
Did you tell him,
so I can travel the globe,

04:10.380 --> 04:12.164
searching for home?

04:13.122 --> 04:14.602
I'm your home.

04:14.602 --> 04:15.733
I know.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.082
Hi.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.563
Happy adoption day,
my sweet girl.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.527
So, Joey,
you're gonna go to sleep.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.616
When you wake up, you'll
already be feeling better.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.099
<i>Is it really bad,
what I have?</i>

04:34.099 --> 04:36.014
All the grown-ups
are freaking out.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.061
I'm a grown-up

04:39.061 --> 04:40.628
and a doctor and your surgeon.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.020
Am I freaking out?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.239
Is Maya freaking out?

04:43.239 --> 04:45.154
I'm definitely
not freaking out.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.677
You know why?

04:46.677 --> 04:48.157
Dr. Fielding's made me
believe in magic.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.506
She's that good.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.596
I have very good instincts.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.511
And right now,
my instincts are telling me

04:54.511 --> 04:56.121
that you're gonna be just fine.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.481
<i>I'm taking this one.</i>

05:07.481 --> 05:09.091
You'll assist.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.745
What?
He's my patient.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.660
That's why you're assisting.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.445
The board decided to sit in
on a procedure today.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.055
They're interested
in pediatrics

05:17.055 --> 05:19.667
and, of course, seeing their
chief of surgery in action.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.626
OK, except that
I'm worried that position

05:22.626 --> 05:24.367
will worsen his bleed.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.021
I suspect his AVM
is above the ventricle.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.414
You suspect?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.154
I know you don't know.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.069
His bleed was so sudden, we
didn't have time to image him.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.941
Dr. Keck,
I'm just remembering

05:32.941 --> 05:34.769
that AVM of yours last month,

05:34.769 --> 05:38.555
how you put the patient prone,
used a far lateral approach.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.817
That was smart.
- Is this really the time

05:39.817 --> 05:41.253
to be arguing, Dr. Fielding?

05:41.253 --> 05:43.386
I feel strongly
that this is the wrong way in.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.170
I'm concerned
if we don't flip him

05:45.170 --> 05:46.389
that he could have another--

05:46.389 --> 05:47.651
Oh, shit.
He's got another bleed.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.479
<i>- OK.
- Get him on his side now.</i>

05:49.479 --> 05:52.395
Towards you.
1, 2, 3.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.396
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:53.396 --> 05:54.919
I told you Keck was a menace.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.878
If you hadn't been there--
- Shh!

05:56.878 --> 05:59.533
Keep your voice down.

05:59.533 --> 06:03.275
I was there, and that boy's
gonna be OK, so...

06:03.275 --> 06:05.756
So he operates on adults
all day, not children.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.105
So he should have been
following your lead

06:07.105 --> 06:09.499
instead of making you
tiptoe around him,

06:09.499 --> 06:11.414
trying not to puncture
his precious ego.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.025
If I'd openly made him
look like an ass,

06:14.025 --> 06:15.810
it would have been much worse.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.420
And that's a win?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.727
How can you be so calm
every time he does this to you?

06:19.727 --> 06:23.383
Because getting angry
won't help my patients.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.993
Yeah, but it might help you.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.342
Yeah, or get me fired.

06:26.342 --> 06:29.040
No way.
If you go, I go.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.434
Listen.
Someday I'll have Keck's job.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.783
And when I do
and you have my job,

06:32.783 --> 06:34.742
you will never have to do
what I just did.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.397
You'll be able to say
what you need to say

06:37.397 --> 06:40.748
and be who you are,
and it'll be a new day.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.880
And remember,

06:42.880 --> 06:45.666
the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.015
Wait.
What does that even mean?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.061
I don't know.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.542
Some guy said it to me
in a bar.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.158
Mom.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.639
Hi.
What are you doing here?

07:03.814 --> 07:06.774
I was downstairs for my scan.

07:09.037 --> 07:09.994
And?

07:13.868 --> 07:15.522
It's back.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.134
No.

07:25.793 --> 07:26.837
Yes.

07:29.013 --> 07:32.190
I checked on our patient,
and, um,

07:32.190 --> 07:33.627
his vitals are steady,

07:33.627 --> 07:36.456
and he's already asking
to play "Minecraft."

07:36.456 --> 07:38.501
I hope you told him
no video games.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.634
That's a great idea.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.374
I-I--I'll--
I'll remind him of that.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.944
It occurred to me
that Daniel Lemle

07:46.944 --> 07:49.120
was in the gallery today,
observing us.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.644
Right.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.516
I've been keeping tabs
on his company Revenia

07:53.516 --> 07:56.040
and the stem cell work
that they're doing,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.390
<i>their trials
with cancer patients.</i>

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
Good for you.
Now, I really do need--

07:59.957 --> 08:02.612
Dr. Keck, I-I--um, I have--

08:02.612 --> 08:05.180
I have to ask you for a favor.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.362
My mother has relapsed,

08:13.362 --> 08:15.886
and I just saw her scan,
and it's not good.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.410
But Revenia is looking
for a research associate.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.239
It's part-time, and it wouldn't
affect my schedule here.

08:21.239 --> 08:24.068
So I'd like to apply
for the job.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.462
I-I mean, the, um--

08:26.462 --> 08:31.511
the stem cell trial
is currently full, but...

08:31.511 --> 08:33.121
maybe we could
squeeze my mother in

08:33.121 --> 08:35.253
<i>if I was already
there working.</i>

08:38.343 --> 08:40.128
<i>So you know Daniel Lemle.</i>

08:40.128 --> 08:44.219
I thought maybe you could
put in a good word for me.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.831
What word would you
have me use?

08:49.616 --> 08:53.184
"Hardworking,"

08:53.184 --> 08:55.622
"impressive," maybe,
whatever you think.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.625
I think Daniel Lemle is one
of our most important donors.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.498
And I'm not sure
I could recommend

09:02.498 --> 09:04.413
a doctor who would be
applying for his position

09:04.413 --> 09:06.284
for personal reasons.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.983
I would never let
the situation with my mom

09:08.983 --> 09:10.332
get in the way of my work.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.725
I think you know me well enough

09:11.725 --> 09:14.031
to know that I'm
a consummate professional.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.120
Oh, well, let me
ask you something.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.687
When that boy wanted
to play "Minecraft,"

09:17.687 --> 09:20.168
you told him right then,
no video games?

09:21.909 --> 09:24.302
I...may have mentioned.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.131
And yet just now, you made it
seem like you hadn't,

09:27.131 --> 09:30.178
like it was my idea.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.441
I'm gonna be honest
with you.

09:32.441 --> 09:35.879
You really can't hide your--
what would you call it--

09:35.879 --> 09:38.926
arrogance,
sense of superiority?

09:38.926 --> 09:40.492
<i>You do try.</i>

09:40.492 --> 09:43.017
<i>You make a good show
of being deferential.</i>

09:43.017 --> 09:46.063
<i>But underneath, you're always
very sure that you're right,</i>

09:46.063 --> 09:48.065
<i>like today
in the operating theater.</i>

09:48.065 --> 09:49.937
- I was right.
- You were lucky.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.548
<i>You're not ready
to take the reins.</i>

09:52.548 --> 09:53.984
I know that's hard to hear,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.812
but I say that
for a number of reasons.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.598
<i>You have to be able
to lead everybody,</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:01.644
not just your female surgeons
and mentees.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.173
Ow.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.046
What?
What's the matter?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.003
<i>Oh!</i>

10:14.265 --> 10:15.266
Dr. Keck!

10:56.351 --> 10:58.179
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

10:58.179 --> 11:01.835
Mm, I took the Lord's name
in vain four times--

11:01.835 --> 11:04.664
Well...
A lot of times.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.317
I gave Sister Sarah the finger

11:06.317 --> 11:09.103
when her back was turned--
again.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.452
<i>What about the man?</i>

11:12.323 --> 11:14.064
I hardly ever
see him anymore.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
Deirdre...

11:15.718 --> 11:17.764
lying is also a sin.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.201
I guess he has
always been around,

11:20.201 --> 11:22.072
even since before
my mother died,

11:22.072 --> 11:24.161
which makes him like family,

11:24.161 --> 11:25.685
only way better,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.338
because you know how crazy
my aunts are.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.169
So... I'm grateful to him.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.518
Even when I was little,

11:33.518 --> 11:35.346
he always knew
what I was feeling.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.523
He actually cared about me.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.396
But now that I'm older,
I don't need him anymore.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.746
I hope that's true.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.487
<i>Ten Our Fathers,
three Hail Marys,</i>

11:45.487 --> 11:47.271
<i>one Act of Contrition--</i>

11:47.271 --> 11:48.751
<i>not that you'll do
any of them.</i>

11:52.842 --> 11:53.974
Stop it.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.932
Stop it now.

11:55.932 --> 11:59.196
<i>Girls, to steal flowers
off the altar</i>

11:59.196 --> 12:00.545
<i>is a cardinal sin.</i>

12:00.545 --> 12:01.851
<i>We didn't steal them.</i>

12:01.851 --> 12:04.462
They just blew into our arms.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.160
Girls, stop it.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.472
<i>I was just talking about you
to Father Duffy.</i>

12:15.473 --> 12:17.214
<i>Don't believe a word
he says about me.</i>

12:18.738 --> 12:20.174
<i>Deirdre!</i>

12:25.309 --> 12:27.442
They're all in your hair.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.226
<i>Deirdre!</i>

12:43.937 --> 12:45.939
Oh, she doesn't listen.
She doesn't.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.636
You never listen.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.378
How many times have I told you

12:50.378 --> 12:52.815
not to encourage him?

12:52.815 --> 12:56.906
Thousands, and yet
you refuse to obey me.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.821
I didn't ask him to come.

12:58.821 --> 13:02.956
Why can't you see that I am
trying to protect you?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.916
Just go to your room

13:06.916 --> 13:09.484
and think
about what you've done.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.497
<i>We'll go there someday.</i>

13:22.497 --> 13:24.151
You've been saying that
since I was ten years old,

13:24.151 --> 13:25.456
and here I am.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
<i>Mm.</i>

13:27.850 --> 13:29.243
<i>She locked you up
because of me,</i>

13:29.243 --> 13:30.853
<i>and now you're angry.</i>

13:30.853 --> 13:32.072
She treats me like a child--

13:32.072 --> 13:34.422
that's no surprise--
but so do you.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.858
Because you are a child.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.642
No, I'm not.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.210
You're behaving like one,

13:40.210 --> 13:42.082
pouting in your room,

13:42.082 --> 13:44.214
throwing a temper tantrum.

13:44.214 --> 13:47.087
Because I don't want
to play your games anymore.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.917
You know how I feel
about you...

13:50.917 --> 13:52.788
and you know what I want
from you.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.792
We both know it's impossible.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.539
When your mother
was your age,

14:04.539 --> 14:07.281
on a night like this,

14:07.281 --> 14:08.760
she'd pull out the dress
she had hidden

14:08.760 --> 14:11.328
in the back of the closet,

14:11.328 --> 14:14.592
disappear down the trellis
to a party.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.382
<i>There's always a party
at your uncle Cortland's.</i>

14:25.125 --> 14:26.648
But that makes no sense.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.215
I know
it doesn't make sense,

14:28.215 --> 14:30.565
but suddenly...

14:30.565 --> 14:34.699
I was picturing
Keck's brain,

14:34.699 --> 14:38.921
like, I mean,
his actual artery

14:38.921 --> 14:40.531
pumping blood.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.882
And--and then he collapsed.

14:46.102 --> 14:50.280
I'm sorry that Dr. Keck
is in the hospital,

14:50.280 --> 14:52.892
but I don't see what that
has to do with you.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
Because you're not
listening to me.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.158
What, the sci-fi part
of the story?

14:58.158 --> 15:00.508
You didn't see
inside his brain

15:00.508 --> 15:03.685
or shoot rays from your head
into his head.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.034
I didn't say rays.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.515
Mom, please, listen, Mom.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.868
Remember Lucy Stone
from second grade?

15:12.868 --> 15:15.305
They said
that she'd had a seizure.

15:15.305 --> 15:19.875
But what I remember
is seeing inside her head,

15:19.875 --> 15:21.572
and then she collapsed.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.750
Are you serious?

15:25.750 --> 15:29.406
If I read his medical report
and it says that he ruptured

15:29.406 --> 15:32.018
his left internal
carotid artery,

15:32.018 --> 15:33.976
which is what I saw
when I was--

15:33.976 --> 15:36.457
I saw--but...

15:36.457 --> 15:38.241
maybe I didn't see it.

15:38.241 --> 15:42.289
Maybe it was just some
neurological event,

15:42.289 --> 15:45.422
or it's some
genetic condition.

15:46.554 --> 15:49.122
But, then, I'd need to know
my genetics to diagnose that.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.775
And I don't know my genetics.
- Please.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.951
- Do I?
- Please, not this.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.256
But if I knew
who my parents were,

15:53.256 --> 15:54.562
then I would know
what I came from,

15:54.562 --> 15:56.390
and I would know who I am.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.088
And then maybe I would
understand what happened.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.744
You know how hard
I have tried

16:02.744 --> 16:05.747
to find your birth parents.

16:05.747 --> 16:10.012
There is nothing we can do
about a closed adoption.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.537
The agency will not
open the records.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.757
I-I'm sorry.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.106
I'm here to comfort you.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.500
Huh.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.893
You're doing
a wonderful job.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.681
You know what I would like
right now?

16:26.681 --> 16:27.812
Hmm.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.858
Is a strawberry milkshake

16:29.858 --> 16:31.991
from In-N-Out out on Jefferson.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.818
And I've got some money
in my purse.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.430
I have a job, Mom.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.997
I can get you a milkshake.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.044
Can you hand me
my purse anyway?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.393
Yeah.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.485
Thanks.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.271
Thank you
for being with me today.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.404
I'll be back.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.990
<i>This is
the New Orleans office.</i>

17:16.383 --> 17:18.167
I need to speak to the person

17:18.167 --> 17:21.040
who is assigned
to my daughter's file.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.172
I'm sorry.
I don't have his name.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.608
Who's calling?

17:24.608 --> 17:25.957
<i>Elena Fielding.</i>

17:25.957 --> 17:27.437
<i>My daughter is Rowan.</i>

17:27.437 --> 17:29.744
Fielding, OK.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.007
Let me check
if there's an agent

17:32.007 --> 17:33.661
assigned to your file.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.576
Hold for a moment.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.167
There is an agent,

18:01.167 --> 18:02.298
<i>but he's not here right now.</i>

18:02.298 --> 18:04.866
<i>I can get him a message.</i>

18:04.866 --> 18:08.739
Please tell him
that my daughter--

18:08.739 --> 18:12.091
<i>that she thinks that she has
harmed someone with her mind.</i>

18:12.091 --> 18:14.136
Did she harm someone
with her mind?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.964
I think she might have.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.619
<i>So what I need
is for this agent</i>

18:18.619 --> 18:22.405
to go and see
if something is different--

18:22.405 --> 18:24.190
in New Orleans, I mean.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.845
<i>I need to know
if something has changed.</i>

18:37.159 --> 18:38.291
Hey.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.772
Sapporo? Shot of Tito's?

18:41.772 --> 18:43.383
Both.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.167
Bad day?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.864
Hard to describe.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.997
When's your shift over?

18:48.997 --> 18:50.390
Sorry, Ro, not tonight.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.174
I've got a date.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.828
Yeah, with me.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.613
No.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.615
With someone who won't
kick me out before breakfast.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.966
I'm not a breakfast person.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.325
<i>♪ Well, I am just
a monkey man ♪</i>

19:12.325 --> 19:15.850
<i>♪ I'm glad you are

19:19.027 --> 19:21.551
<i>♪ I was bitten by a boar</i>

19:21.551 --> 19:24.511
<i>♪ I was gouged

19:24.511 --> 19:27.209

19:29.603 --> 19:31.909

19:31.909 --> 19:33.041

19:33.041 --> 19:34.651
<i>The kindness of strangers.</i>

19:34.651 --> 19:36.479
Can I get you anything?

19:36.479 --> 19:38.133
Yeah, you can
get me out of here.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.180
<i>OK.</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:44.052
<i>Um, how about I get
your name first?</i>

19:48.099 --> 19:50.406

20:09.947 --> 20:12.167
that clown back there.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.300
Why, Ro?

20:15.997 --> 20:19.305
For months, I've been watching
you from behind the bar,

20:19.305 --> 20:22.090
this revolving door of guys.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.092
It's got to be so lonely.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.008
Why are you watching me?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.532
We're friends.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.928
I like you.

20:34.755 --> 20:38.106
Well, for one,
I bring guys like that home

20:38.106 --> 20:40.674
because they don't
lie next to me

20:40.674 --> 20:42.850
and hound me with questions.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.247
Is it an only-child thing?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.683
Why don't we try
head-shrinking you

20:49.683 --> 20:51.772
for a minute?

20:51.772 --> 20:54.557
What exactly is it
you're looking for,

20:54.557 --> 20:55.819
your one true love?

20:55.819 --> 20:56.907
Fuck you.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.475
No, I-I think it's sweet.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.260
I actually--when I was a kid,
I remember

21:01.260 --> 21:02.957
feeling something like that.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.264
I had this...

21:05.264 --> 21:09.877
weird idea that my shadow
was this...

21:09.877 --> 21:13.359
being that was somehow...

21:13.359 --> 21:14.969
part of me.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.800
And he--uh,
it seemed like a he.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.284
He was someone who knew
what I was thinking,

21:25.284 --> 21:28.765
and he knew
my most secret secrets.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.246
And...

21:31.246 --> 21:33.814
he loved me,
and he always had.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.647
So you do know
what I'm talking about.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.347
I'm sorry I can't
be more to you, Max.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.870
But you know what?

21:46.870 --> 21:50.265
I am here now, so...

21:52.398 --> 21:54.400
What?

21:56.489 --> 21:58.012
Hey.

21:58.012 --> 22:01.450
Hey, you canceled
your date for this.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.542
I hope you find him.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.377
Oh, my goodness.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.773
No, no, no,
not the pinkie, not yet.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.864
Oh, we don't want
to rush things along, Thomas.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.867
After all,
the evening is so young.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.174
Mm.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.350
Ooh!

22:31.350 --> 22:33.177
Don't--don't hog the beauty.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.136
Come on.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.051
Mr. Cortland.

22:37.051 --> 22:40.402
So beautiful.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.099
<i>- Mr. Cortland.</i>
- Mm.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.927
<i>Sir, the young gentlemen
have arrived.</i>

22:43.927 --> 22:46.365
Ah, good.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.113
Well done.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

23:04.905 --> 23:08.517
Well, now,
I think we have a winner.

23:08.517 --> 23:11.781
Young man...

23:11.781 --> 23:14.218
I have a job for you.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.612
Nice to see you too.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.527
Hey, there he is.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.015
Is that really you?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.320
You escaped?

23:29.320 --> 23:30.757
Yes.

23:30.757 --> 23:34.587
Deidre,
what a happy surprise.

23:34.587 --> 23:38.591
You look just like your mother.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.027
All grown up.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.943
- Thank you.
- Mm.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.684
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

23:44.684 --> 23:47.469
Oh, not for you, <i>cher.</i>

23:47.469 --> 23:49.297
Uncle Cortland.

23:50.733 --> 23:54.345
No, for you, only the best.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.825
You can't imagine
the number of times

23:55.825 --> 23:57.174
I've driven by your house
and thought

23:57.174 --> 23:59.699
I should stop and throw stones
at your window,

23:59.699 --> 24:01.048
try to get you out of there.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.050
I wish you had.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.748
Well, I'm sure it would
only make more trouble

24:05.748 --> 24:08.751
between you and my sisters.

24:10.144 --> 24:13.408
So here's to you,

24:13.408 --> 24:15.454
here at last

24:15.454 --> 24:17.586
and such a delightful surprise.

24:20.763 --> 24:25.507
Hmm, I am so glad
you're wearing this.

24:25.507 --> 24:29.032
You know, this belonged
to your mother.

24:29.032 --> 24:32.601
The aunts never talk
to me about my mother.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.605
Aw, well, now,
they are wicked.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.521
The worst kind of wicked.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.175
Well, here's what I remember.

24:41.175 --> 24:44.874
Your mother was full of life...
and mischief.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.573
When she'd laugh,
it was like

24:47.573 --> 24:50.184
fireworks lighting up the sky.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.708
And she was funny

24:52.708 --> 24:55.755
and so beautiful.

24:55.755 --> 24:59.846
Course, she paid
for her high spirits.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.633
I don't believe
she jumped from the balcony.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.072
You might be right.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.858
And I want you to promise me

25:11.858 --> 25:13.337
you'll be careful.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.993
Hi.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.734
I'm Patrick.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.388
My friend from the other room

25:20.388 --> 25:21.694
dared me
to ask you to dance, so...

25:24.261 --> 25:26.307
Sure, go ahead.
Dance. Have fun.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.656
That's what we're here for,
isn't it?

25:27.656 --> 25:29.092
Go on.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.103
Don't forget to leave
a glass slipper, <i>cher.</i>

27:33.086 --> 27:34.653
Patrick?

27:44.706 --> 27:47.361
<i>Miss Mayfair,
your aunt is here.</i>

27:47.361 --> 27:50.016
She's insisting you come
downstairs right away.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.477
Hello?

29:00.477 --> 29:02.392
This is Ciprien Grieve.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.351
I'm the agent in charge
of your daughter's file.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.136
Oh.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.835
Thank you so much
for calling me back.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.402
I--
<i>- I'm at the house now,</i>

29:12.402 --> 29:13.969
the house on First Street
in New Orleans?

29:13.969 --> 29:16.058
I see.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.756
Uh...

29:17.756 --> 29:21.281
I guess I was just
wondering if...

29:21.281 --> 29:23.587
anything has...

29:23.587 --> 29:27.504
been disturbed
or--or different.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.985
<i>Well, if you're
asking if the man is here,</i>

29:29.985 --> 29:32.509
I don't see him, but...

29:32.509 --> 29:34.642
I can feel him.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.209
He's very near.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.431
So this is--
This is good news.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.172
He's here.
Your daughter's there.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.304
2,000 miles between them.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.132
So...

29:46.132 --> 29:48.264
you can breathe
a little easier, right?

29:48.264 --> 29:50.266
For now,

29:50.266 --> 29:53.226
<i>but time
is running out for me.</i>

29:53.226 --> 29:55.010
<i>I need to know</i>

29:55.010 --> 29:58.927
what's gonna happen
the next time you call me

29:58.927 --> 30:00.973
and no one answers.

30:00.973 --> 30:05.847
<i>I need to know who is going
to keep my daughter safe,</i>

30:05.847 --> 30:07.283
<i>Mr. Grieve.</i>

30:08.894 --> 30:10.156
I will.

30:15.161 --> 30:18.555
I'm the one that will
keep your daughter safe.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.080
<i>Let's take a deep breath.</i>

30:21.080 --> 30:23.822
Feel the air in our lungs.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.302
Celebrate, for a moment,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.174
the great gift of life, huh?

30:28.174 --> 30:29.610
<i>Come on.</i>

30:31.568 --> 30:35.355
Ah, felt good, didn't it?

30:38.314 --> 30:40.882
I don't know about you, but...

30:40.882 --> 30:45.017
I'd like to keep doing that
for another, oh, I don't know,

30:45.017 --> 30:47.193
twenty, thirty...

30:47.193 --> 30:48.890
thousand years.

30:51.545 --> 30:55.462
<i>I'm Daniel Lemle,
CEO of Revenia Research.</i>

30:55.462 --> 30:57.681
And here at Revenia,

30:57.681 --> 30:59.901
we believe death is encoded.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.904
<i>If there is a code,</i>

31:02.904 --> 31:04.340
we can crack it.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.168
And if we can crack it,

31:06.168 --> 31:07.256
then we can hack it.

31:09.389 --> 31:12.696
Before I go,

31:12.696 --> 31:15.090
take a moment
and look at each other.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.746
<i>See, you...</i>

31:18.746 --> 31:22.881
are the first generation
of human beings

31:22.881 --> 31:24.970
that just might live forever.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.065
Did you like my speech?

31:33.065 --> 31:34.501
Hi.
I did.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.938
I just--I hadn't put together
that the position

31:36.938 --> 31:39.941
I applied for is part
of longevity research.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.161
Oh, you could see
the overlap, of course.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.163
I mean, cure cellular
malfunctions in humans,

31:44.163 --> 31:47.818
and you've eliminated almost
all the reasons we croak.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.951
I did wonder, though,

31:49.951 --> 31:51.561
why does a hotshot neurosurgeon

31:51.561 --> 31:53.737
who studied microscopy
and gene sequencing

31:53.737 --> 31:57.132
end up looking
for a research gig here?

31:57.132 --> 31:59.918
Then I learned
about your mother.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.877
I make calls for all
prospective hires.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.444
It's OK.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.619
Of course you want your mother
in one of our trials.

32:05.619 --> 32:06.925
I get it.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.883
When I first got to Revenia,

32:08.883 --> 32:11.886
I put my wife on the board,
and all hell broke loose,

32:11.886 --> 32:14.584
the other board members
screeching about nepotism.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.369
She wasn't qualified,
no added value--

32:16.369 --> 32:17.936
I mean, on and on.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.938
What did I say back to them?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.896
Fuck off.

32:24.725 --> 32:28.163
Well, I-I do want my mother
in the trial.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.209
I think she's
a suitable candidate,

32:30.209 --> 32:32.037
and--and I don't think
that there's anything wrong

32:32.037 --> 32:34.996
with being personally motivated
to--to want a job.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.607
And I think--I think
it'll make me work harder.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.828
My point exactly,

32:40.828 --> 32:43.352
which means
my hunch about you was right.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.615
Now, come downstairs,

32:45.615 --> 32:47.704
and I can show you
where you'll be working.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.404
Wait.
I--so I-I got the job?

32:51.404 --> 32:52.622
Come on.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.018
The hours will be long,
and I need to know now

32:57.018 --> 32:58.672
how that's gonna fly
with the husband,

32:58.672 --> 33:00.587
boyfriend, kids.

33:00.587 --> 33:01.762
None of the above.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.024
All right. Check it out.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.852
It's a Rodin.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.897
I got a great deal
at a private auction.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.684
Do you like modern art?

33:12.512 --> 33:14.818
<i>You know, Judy Chicago has
some kind of performance piece</i>

33:14.818 --> 33:16.646
at the de Young tonight.

33:16.646 --> 33:19.736
My wife's busy,
and I have an extra ticket.

33:20.824 --> 33:24.611
I can't tonight, but I, um--

33:24.611 --> 33:27.831
I'll get in touch with HR
to get my paperwork started.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.529
And I have all
my mom's records with me.

33:29.529 --> 33:32.314
The--the tough thing
with the trial is,

33:32.314 --> 33:34.795
we only have so much room,
of course.

33:34.795 --> 33:37.450
I'll have to rejigger things
to get your mom in,

33:37.450 --> 33:39.887
which I'm happy to do.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.763
I do have a reputation
for being tough.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.244
If you work here,
you got to run with the boys--

33:49.244 --> 33:51.072
and the girls.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.857
You got to think like a killer, yeah?

33:53.857 --> 33:56.860
Metaphorically, of course.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.688
I know a lot of doctors
who are killers

33:58.688 --> 34:00.821
and not just metaphorically.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.781
So...

34:04.781 --> 34:06.653
pick a name.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.524
Let's get your mom
in this thing.

34:08.524 --> 34:11.049
- Pick a name?
- There's 30 slots.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.963
We already have 30 patients.

34:12.963 --> 34:16.010
It doesn't matter to me which
patient your mom replaces.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.667
I'm sure you can just
add my mom to the list

34:20.667 --> 34:22.930
and--and make it 31.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.671
I'm sure you haven't dealt
with the FDA before.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.673
They're Nazis about this stuff.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.589
30's the number, so...

34:29.589 --> 34:31.373
go on, pick a name.

34:35.247 --> 34:37.423
Please don't do this.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.815
This is my mother's life,

34:38.815 --> 34:40.165
and she's--she's all
that I have.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.080
But I can't just pick a name.
- Dr. Fielding.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.430
Those are just names
in a trial.

34:44.430 --> 34:45.735
Cross one out.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.737
Don't get tangled
in the minutia, huh?

34:47.737 --> 34:49.304
You mean patients.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.479
Look.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.135
You got a job to do.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.746
I got a company to run.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.008
Pick a name.

35:02.448 --> 35:05.842
If my mother saw me
pick a name,

35:05.842 --> 35:07.583
she would drop dead
on the spot

35:07.583 --> 35:09.455
way before the cancer
could kill her.

35:11.892 --> 35:14.808
I can't pick a name.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.071
Don't tell me my hunch
about you was wrong.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.727
I hate being wrong.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.425
Because someone like you is
never really wrong, are they?

35:23.425 --> 35:25.166
After all, you're so powerful.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.602
You're so special.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.561
All right.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.172
Maybe, uh--

35:31.172 --> 35:33.218
yeah, maybe you don't get
what we're doing here.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.002
I know what I'm doing here.

35:35.002 --> 35:38.092
I'm pretending
that I find you interesting,

35:38.092 --> 35:40.834
pretending that I think
you're smarter than me,

35:40.834 --> 35:43.880
pretending that I admire you,
but I don't admire you.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.710
In fact, I see through you
to the small, needy man-child

35:47.710 --> 35:49.886
with the raging ego,

35:49.886 --> 35:52.324
the dupe who overpays
for a fake Rodin,

35:52.324 --> 35:54.456
the bully who can only
feel good about himself

35:54.456 --> 35:56.980
if everybody else is minutia.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.200
You think that you
should live forever. Why?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.202
So that you can piss
in front of more women

36:01.202 --> 36:03.161
or play God
with cancer patients' lives?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.771
Or maybe you think
that you should never die

36:04.771 --> 36:07.252
simply because you're such
a dazzling gift to the world,

36:07.252 --> 36:08.905
so busy changing it.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.640
What is it?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.076
What happened?

36:49.076 --> 36:52.775
Mom, it happened again,

36:52.775 --> 36:55.517
just like it did
with Keck and Lucy Stone.

36:55.517 --> 36:59.521
Ex-except this time, I lost
my temper and I made it happen.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.176
Rowan, I cannot hear this.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.222
I have to face it.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.224
I have to face
what's happening.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.226
There's something
really wrong with me.

37:09.662 --> 37:12.621
I have some--some kind of--

37:12.621 --> 37:14.797
of monstrous power.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.016
Rowan.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.801
Rowan, I am tired.

37:18.801 --> 37:23.589
I cannot hear this nonsense.

37:23.589 --> 37:27.506
You do not have a power.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.772
Listen to me.

37:35.427 --> 37:39.082
You have got to get
ahold of yourself.

37:39.082 --> 37:42.216
You cannot give in
to this twisted thinking.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.739
It is dangerous.

37:45.350 --> 37:50.006
And I will not
spend my last days worrying

37:50.006 --> 37:53.880
that you are gonna get sucked
into some sick delusion.

37:56.796 --> 38:00.452
Rowan...

38:00.452 --> 38:03.237
just be with me.

38:03.237 --> 38:06.806
That's all I'm asking.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.416
That's all I want.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.334
OK.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.176
Deirdre, it's Father Duffy.

38:31.439 --> 38:35.182
You need to open the door
right this minute.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.640
So this boy...

38:58.640 --> 39:00.207
Patrick.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.036
He hasn't called
or visited you?

39:03.036 --> 39:05.430
He can't visit
because he's dead.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.999
The body that they
carried out,

39:09.999 --> 39:11.436
it was him.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.002
You don't know that.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.613
I know what I know.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.529
<i>Aunt Carlotta, she killed him</i>

39:17.529 --> 39:20.314
because he made me happy.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.360
She was there when they
took his body away.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.883
Deirdre...

39:23.883 --> 39:27.234
how can I help you
when you tell tales like this,

39:27.234 --> 39:30.237
a crazy story about your family
killing a boy?

39:30.237 --> 39:33.066
I'm not lying,
and you know I'm not.

39:36.461 --> 39:40.247
You know the awful things
that happen in this family...

39:40.247 --> 39:41.901
in this house.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.339
Weren't you the one they called

39:45.339 --> 39:47.385
when my mother
was pushed from the balcony?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.518
She jumped...

39:50.518 --> 39:52.651
because she was
in such pain and turmoil,

39:52.651 --> 39:55.044
God rest her soul.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.873
And now I'm worried
for your soul,

39:57.873 --> 39:59.745
for the soul of your child.

40:01.486 --> 40:05.620
I can't help but think
there was no boy at that party,

40:05.620 --> 40:09.189
that this has happened
because of the man.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.542
He didn't do this.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.851
I haven't seen him
since that night.

40:23.856 --> 40:26.380
Father, please,

40:26.380 --> 40:29.644
I have to get out of here...

40:29.644 --> 40:32.778
before something
even worse happens.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.955
Please... help me.

40:37.652 --> 40:41.961
The surest and truest
help I know comes from God.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.137
Will you at least pray with me?

40:47.053 --> 40:48.663
You're scared of them...

40:51.710 --> 40:53.363
Like everyone else.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.019
Just go.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.238
<i>Go!</i>

42:18.318 --> 42:19.798
<i>Darling...</i>

42:19.798 --> 42:21.234
<i>No.</i>

42:25.630 --> 42:27.370
Lasher.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.763
<i>You know where to find me.</i>

42:36.815 --> 42:40.688
<i>Dear God,
the darkness is here.</i>

42:42.168 --> 42:44.866
The darkness is in her,

42:44.866 --> 42:47.782
that sweet, beautiful girl.

42:49.741 --> 42:51.525
It's growing in her.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.878
I fear for her
and for her unborn child.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.360
Oh, dear God,
I fear for us all.

43:03.406 --> 43:05.800
I fear what we may have to do.

43:22.077 --> 43:25.080
Give me one good reason
to live.

43:39.225 --> 43:40.835
That baby is coming.

43:42.097 --> 43:44.099
<i>She will change everything.</i>

43:44.099 --> 43:45.884
She will change
your life forever.

43:51.977 --> 43:53.326
She won't.

43:55.110 --> 43:59.288
She will be stuck with them,
just like I am.

43:59.288 --> 44:02.378
And you can't take us
away from here.

44:02.378 --> 44:04.642
Yes, I can.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.298
I'm yours already.

44:11.170 --> 44:13.825
The necklace you wear,
it binds us together,

44:18.307 --> 44:20.092
Ah,

44:20.092 --> 44:22.616
but only because your mother
made that choice for you.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.012
Now you're old enough to make
that choice for yourself...

44:28.753 --> 44:30.842
To bind with me
of your own free will.

44:33.235 --> 44:35.107
So take it off.

44:43.071 --> 44:44.682
And I will show you.

44:47.554 --> 44:49.469
I will show you
who I really am.

44:51.340 --> 44:54.866
And if you're strong enough
to face this...

44:54.866 --> 44:58.347
I will be yours entirely,

44:58.347 --> 45:00.132
<i>yours to command.</i>

45:03.831 --> 45:05.790
<i>Do you want to see
who I truly am?</i>

45:09.881 --> 45:11.447
I do.

45:15.103 --> 45:17.149
I am everyone.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.761
<i>I am no one.</i>

45:22.807 --> 45:24.634
<i>I'm a saint.</i>

45:24.634 --> 45:26.636
<i>I'm a demon.</i>

45:30.771 --> 45:33.600
<i>Will you take me, Deirdre?</i>

45:33.600 --> 45:36.342
<i>Will you take me
to be yours forever?</i>

45:55.056 --> 45:56.884
You are my witch now.

46:16.251 --> 46:18.210
May the Lord
who frees you from sin

46:18.210 --> 46:21.517
save you and raise you up.

46:26.958 --> 46:30.091
<i>♪ You only hear</i>

46:30.091 --> 46:32.833
<i>♪ What you want to hear</i>

46:34.617 --> 46:38.186
<i>♪ Take my heart
as a souvenir ♪</i>

46:38.186 --> 46:40.580
<i>I wanted so badly
to save her.</i>

46:40.580 --> 46:42.495
<i>Of course you did,</i>

46:42.495 --> 46:44.845
<i>but these things
are not in our hands.</i>

46:44.845 --> 46:46.716
They're in God's.

46:46.716 --> 46:48.718
What you did do

46:48.718 --> 46:51.591
is love your mother
with all your heart.

46:51.591 --> 46:54.507
It's a girl, isn't it?

46:54.507 --> 46:55.900
I want to see her.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.466
<i>She needs to see
the doctor first.</i>

46:57.466 --> 46:59.729
No!
Carlotta!

46:59.729 --> 47:01.644
No!
Bring her back!

47:01.644 --> 47:02.776
No!

47:02.776 --> 47:05.344
Carlotta, no!

47:05.344 --> 47:08.782
<i>♪ You're losing</i>

47:08.782 --> 47:12.133
<i>♪ Hands fall limp</i>

47:12.133 --> 47:15.615
<i>♪ And I drift off</i>

47:15.615 --> 47:18.923
<i>♪ Learning how</i>

47:18.923 --> 47:22.317
<i>♪ To speak again</i>

47:24.319 --> 47:34.721
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

47:38.290 --> 47:47.560
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

47:51.346 --> 47:52.870
Here are the rules.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.089
You will change your name.

47:55.089 --> 47:57.222
<i>You will no longer
be a Mayfair.</i>

47:57.222 --> 47:59.615
<i>You will never return here.</i>

47:59.615 --> 48:01.139
<i>You will never call.</i>

48:01.139 --> 48:03.793
<i>And most importantly,</i>

48:03.793 --> 48:07.493
<i>this baby can never,
ever know who she is.</i>

48:08.363 --> 48:11.584
It would be too dangerous
for this family and for her.

48:11.584 --> 48:14.108
Whatever you say,
Aunt Carlotta.

48:18.504 --> 48:19.984
<i>♪ When I feel small</i>

48:19.984 --> 48:21.028
What's her name?

48:21.028 --> 48:24.945
<i>♪ You hold me</i>

48:24.945 --> 48:29.210
Deirdre wanted
to name her... Rowan.

48:29.210 --> 48:32.474
<i>♪ Closely</i>

48:32.474 --> 48:34.433
<i>♪ Looking through</i>

48:36.261 --> 48:39.046
<i>♪ The stained glass window</i>

48:39.046 --> 48:40.874
Rowan.

48:40.874 --> 48:42.484
<i>♪ You might catch
something ♪</i>

48:42.484 --> 48:44.530
Hi.

48:44.530 --> 48:48.186
<i>♪ Holy too</i>

48:48.186 --> 48:57.369
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

48:57.369 --> 48:59.980
A malformed heart.

48:59.980 --> 49:02.940
The doctor said
she couldn't have survived.

49:02.940 --> 49:06.421
He's going to come and give you
a shot to help you sleep.

49:06.421 --> 49:10.295
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

49:16.344 --> 49:18.868
Ah, poor thing.

49:18.868 --> 49:20.392
Have you been trying
to get this off?

49:44.633 --> 49:46.287
There.

49:52.032 --> 49:53.686
You and I...

50:02.347 --> 50:04.349
Are gonna share
a little secret.

50:08.657 --> 50:11.747
I'm not gonna give you
the Thorazine shot today.

50:11.747 --> 50:14.794
And I'm not gonna
give it to you tomorrow.

50:14.794 --> 50:17.318
But I will come every day,

50:17.318 --> 50:19.538
because what
I really want to know

50:19.538 --> 50:23.107
is who you are
without the drugs.

50:23.107 --> 50:27.807
I want to know
who Deirdre Mayfair really is.

50:35.467 --> 50:38.600
Lasher is on the move.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.820
I need to call
Rowan Fielding's mother.
