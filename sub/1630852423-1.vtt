I am 26 years old
and I'm from the beautiful Miami, Florida.

06:54.122 --> 06:54.956
<i>Hello?</i>

06:56.374 --> 06:59.168
<i>Hi, Keauno.</i>
<i>I'm in the bathroom at Walmart.</i>

07:07.218 --> 07:09.387
-Any advice?
<i>-They're gonna love you.</i>

07:09.470 --> 07:11.806
<i>But remember to think before you speak.</i>

15:17.041 --> 15:18.375
Bruce, like the shark.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.794
Are you Australian?

23:56.685 --> 23:59.062
But why is that literally me?
I'm like that too.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.023
They're like the models
and very charismatic…

24:02.107 --> 24:03.275
And I'm awkward, like…

24:03.358 --> 24:06.069
I thought that so much.
I was literally coming in.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.655
I'm like,
"Look at them. They're fucking stunning."

24:09.698 --> 24:12.159
I'm like, "I'm the only girl here
with fucking… meat."

24:12.242 --> 24:14.286
Like, I feel you so much.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.804
You don't really know me.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.306
I know that we have
matching nose piercings.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.432
-So if you and me are on a date.
-Yeah.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.975
-And the bill comes out.
-Yeah.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.268
You're asking me what I would do?

27:25.352 --> 27:26.353
On a first date…

27:26.436 --> 27:27.854
I would think the man should cover it.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.238
-I don't care.
-He's not the guy.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.753
Don't try to come between us.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.297
-You wish you could.
-We have a special bond here.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.768
You wanna come with me?

28:07.394 --> 28:08.228
Let's go.

28:24.619 --> 28:25.995
Why does your butt look so good?

28:26.079 --> 28:27.247
Does it really?

28:27.330 --> 28:29.124
Oh, my God. I'm fucking screaming.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.506
So I eat only animal meat,

33:28.589 --> 33:30.883
but only the vegan version of it.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.196
What was his message?

38:08.327 --> 38:09.495
You are lying…

38:09.578 --> 38:11.330
-You lie like a rug.
-Look. He literally wrote it.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.040
You lie like a rug.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.265
I'll never understand how y'all can
talk right in front of me

38:29.348 --> 38:30.891
and I wouldn't know shit
y'all talking about.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.270
It's okay.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.646
-Who is she?
-It's okay.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.440
You don't look like you want a drink.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.174
Well, I'm just establishing my dominance.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.259
You're not. You're trying to.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.553
But I feel like
maybe I'm accomplishing that.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.513
You're definitely an alpha male,
but it's like…

39:09.597 --> 39:11.182
Alpha female.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.268
Thank you for the correction.
I greatly appreciate that.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.122
You're fucking scared.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.290
-Who?
-You.

40:59.373 --> 41:00.833
-Who's scared?
-You're scared.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.054
I win when I compete, all right?

41:55.596 --> 41:56.931
So do I though. That's the thing.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.225
I'm better in bed so…

41:59.308 --> 42:00.809
-You're better in what?
-In bed.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.102
In bed? You think so?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.145
Yeah, I know so.
