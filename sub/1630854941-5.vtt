WEBVTT

00:11.503 --> 00:13.589
That's enough. Let's go.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.591
I got it.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.386
Hurry up! Let's go! Vamos!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.295
How was this once our home?

00:54.213 --> 00:57.509
It's hard to look at
and not think about what happened.

01:01.012 --> 01:02.137
I know.

01:04.598 --> 01:09.645
But I like to remember
the good things, too.

01:13.566 --> 01:14.942
Come on, Rafa.

01:25.869 --> 01:30.416
Did you know that this is
where I saw you for the first time?

01:31.750 --> 01:35.713
- No. You can't possibly know that.
- How do you know?

01:38.633 --> 01:39.883
Here, than?

01:40.551 --> 01:41.928
Yes, here.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.351
We'll have good memories again.

01:50.353 --> 01:52.396
Get back everything we lost.

01:54.274 --> 01:55.650
Have our own place.

01:57.234 --> 01:58.445
A family.

02:08.245 --> 02:09.955
Will you marry me, Sofia?

02:11.749 --> 02:12.708
Yes.

02:13.668 --> 02:16.922
- Yes.
- Long live the newlyweds!

02:46.284 --> 02:47.952
I love you.

03:28.743 --> 03:29.869
Pick up.

03:33.790 --> 03:35.542
- Get that?
- No.

03:41.463 --> 03:42.756
Perry.

03:44.217 --> 03:46.595
What time are you due in court today?

03:48.847 --> 03:50.222
About an hour.

03:51.516 --> 03:53.100
- Perry.
- Yeah?

03:56.186 --> 03:57.606
What are you doing?

03:59.065 --> 04:01.151
Have you ever been to Yosemite?

04:02.986 --> 04:07.072
I haven't. Your trousers
are on your toy train.

04:08.866 --> 04:12.578
Thank you.
It's an amazing place to ride horses.

04:12.578 --> 04:15.414
I'm sure it is,
especially riding to the sunset.

04:15.414 --> 04:16.582
Best time.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.126
We should go.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.379
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.760
Right now.

04:30.138 --> 04:32.389
I think others need us today.

04:34.726 --> 04:38.062
I don't know how to fight this case.
I don't.

04:43.275 --> 04:46.696
Well, you have 58 minutes.

04:49.783 --> 04:51.241
Figure it out.

04:57.623 --> 04:59.876
Can't wait to hear all about it.

05:06.007 --> 05:08.009
Stop calling, Della.

05:25.109 --> 05:26.110
Ready?

05:26.735 --> 05:27.946
Are you?

05:27.946 --> 05:29.279
Do I have a choice?

05:30.656 --> 05:32.450
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

05:32.450 --> 05:33.702
Thanks.

05:35.579 --> 05:40.165
Join us now for another hour
of truth and justice

05:40.708 --> 05:43.086
with Fighting Frank Finnerty.

05:45.004 --> 05:50.092
As the most important trial our city
has seen in a great while commences

05:50.092 --> 05:52.219
I ask you this:

05:53.179 --> 06:00.270
<i>why is it only the witnesses must
swear to tell the whole truth?</i>

06:02.146 --> 06:06.067
<i>Why isn't the same oath
administered to the attorneys?</i>

06:07.234 --> 06:10.487
<i>For what was exhibited
in the opening statements</i>

06:10.487 --> 06:12.031
of the McCutcheon murder trial

06:12.448 --> 06:16.201
was a display of the highest
integrity on one hand

06:17.202 --> 06:20.290
and utter deceit on the other.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.834
Please be seated.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.586
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

06:25.586 --> 06:28.965
Rafael and Mateo Gallardo,
the men you see before you today,

06:28.965 --> 06:31.301
are guilty of murder
in the first degree.

06:31.301 --> 06:35.931
They killed Brooks McCutcheon,
a beacon of hope for this city.

06:35.931 --> 06:39.267
And for what?
Couple of bucks and a gold coin?

06:39.933 --> 06:44.481
And don't be fooled by their sob
story of poverty and suffering

06:44.481 --> 06:45.814
because in these times,

06:45.814 --> 06:48.984
who here hasn't seen hardship
of one sort or another?

06:48.984 --> 06:52.739
But who among you has resorted
to murder as the remedy?

06:53.113 --> 06:56.576
None of you, of course.
Except for these two men right here.

06:56.950 --> 07:01.665
Weak of character, devoid of humanity,
of innate decency, cold-blooded...

07:01.665 --> 07:03.416
Ladies and gentlemen,
this prosecution,

07:03.416 --> 07:09.172
maintains that Brooks McCutcheon
was our city's last great shining star.

07:09.922 --> 07:14.093
And therefore, you do wonder who
would want to harm such a fine man.

07:14.636 --> 07:18.098
But when we introduce you
to the real Brooks McCutcheon,

07:18.098 --> 07:20.724
you won't be asking who
in this town wanted him killed.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.228
You'll be asking
who in this town didn't?

07:23.645 --> 07:27.857
And the punishment must serve as
an example to the people of this city

07:28.441 --> 07:32.946
that barbaric behavior
of this magnitude will not be tolerated.

07:32.946 --> 07:36.992
This prosecution is intent
on manipulating,

07:38.243 --> 07:41.955
swaying, influencing opinion
in the worst possible way.

07:43.414 --> 07:44.915
These proceedings
have already become

07:44.915 --> 07:47.419
nothing less than a racist witch hunt.

07:49.879 --> 07:53.257
The jury in this case
is not limited to 12.

07:53.590 --> 07:57.470
For you, fellow citizens,
are also on the jury.

07:58.262 --> 08:00.222
And we must make sure

08:00.640 --> 08:06.145
that no one is allowed
to destroy the integrity of our laws,

08:07.062 --> 08:11.401
our liberty,
and our City of Angels!

08:13.028 --> 08:17.324
District seven is becoming
one of the finest in all of Los Angeles.

08:17.866 --> 08:21.036
So, it is my great pleasure
to dedicate this stunning gazebo

08:21.410 --> 08:25.914
as a shining example of what can be
achieved when we all work together.

08:25.914 --> 08:27.876
Smile for the cameras, ladies.

08:29.168 --> 08:33.757
There we are. Great job.
Wonderful. Pleasure.

08:35.634 --> 08:38.845
Now, where is this cake
that I've heard so much about?

08:40.138 --> 08:41.472
Thank you very much.

08:42.349 --> 08:43.850
- Councilman Taylor.
- Thank you.

08:44.350 --> 08:47.562
- May I borrow a minute of your time?
- I got my hands full at the moment.

08:47.562 --> 08:48.896
Perhaps you can try my office.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.107
I tried, but they told me your hands
were pretty full down there too.

08:52.107 --> 08:54.485
Well, my district has a lot of needs.

08:58.530 --> 09:01.534
This one's outside your district, councilman.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.458
Get to your point.

09:09.291 --> 09:12.796
I'm just trying to find out how your
sister Noreen ended up there.

09:13.212 --> 09:14.505
It was a car accident.

09:15.757 --> 09:17.508
And was Brooks McCutcheon driving?

09:18.510 --> 09:21.388
I work for the attorneys representing
the boys arrested in the case.

09:21.930 --> 09:23.389
How does what happened to Noreen

09:23.389 --> 09:25.267
have anything to do
with Brooks's death?

09:25.267 --> 09:27.602
No, I'm just trying to get
a full picture of the man.

09:28.769 --> 09:33.273
- Brooks knew Noreen in some capacity.
- She worked for his company. So what?

09:33.691 --> 09:38.112
And I'm also wondering how that
stadium project of his fits into all this

09:38.112 --> 09:40.489
since it's in your district.

09:41.199 --> 09:43.367
I don't really like investigators.

09:44.703 --> 09:48.831
Especially shadowy ones who step
in places they aren't welcome.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.340
It was a car accident.
And it's a private family matter.

09:58.508 --> 10:00.468
And it's gonna stay that way.

10:01.593 --> 10:03.346
So your investigation?

10:05.307 --> 10:06.265
It ends here.

10:09.311 --> 10:12.563
This is everything I've wished for. Beautiful.

10:13.939 --> 10:16.776
The people call Mr. Brian Walsh
to the stand.

10:27.369 --> 10:30.749
- Mr. Walsh, what is your occupation?
- I'm a bus driver for the city.

10:31.207 --> 10:32.583
And what is the route that you drive?

10:32.583 --> 10:34.753
Across town along
Santa Monica Boulevard

10:34.753 --> 10:37.296
from Vermont Avenue
to Ocean Avenue.

10:37.296 --> 10:40.424
- What time of day do you drive?
- Six PM to six AM.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.926
And how long you been driving
this route?

10:42.926 --> 10:44.178
Five years.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.390
So, you must know the route
and the stops very well then?

10:47.390 --> 10:49.351
Backwards and forwards.

10:49.351 --> 10:50.685
Do you have a lot of regular
passengers?

10:50.685 --> 10:54.189
I know a fair amount of 'em
by the way they look, sure.

10:54.189 --> 10:57.399
And would say that if someone of
another race were to get on your bus,

10:57.399 --> 10:58.651
you would notice them more?

10:58.651 --> 11:01.779
- Objection, leading.
- Sustained.

11:01.779 --> 11:03.073
I'll be more direct.

11:03.073 --> 11:05.784
Do you remember seeing
the defendants board your bus

11:05.784 --> 11:07.409
on the evening of March 18th?

11:07.785 --> 11:09.788
Yeah. At Santa Monica and Stanley.

11:10.455 --> 11:13.959
How can I miss them?
I always watch those types careful.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.629
- Had you seen them before?
- I have. Most Saturday nights.

11:17.962 --> 11:21.465
- Where'd they get off?
- All the way to the end of the line.

11:22.092 --> 11:24.052
What time did you get
to the end of your route?

11:24.052 --> 11:26.178
I make four round trips in a shift.

11:26.178 --> 11:30.975
This was the second one,
and I got there, as always, at 12:05.

11:30.975 --> 11:33.852
12:05. Now, according
to the coroner's report,

11:34.312 --> 11:38.565
the time of death, which was a short
walk from the last bus stop I should add,

11:38.565 --> 11:39.901
was 1:30 AM.

11:40.484 --> 11:41.694
Clearly enough time

11:41.694 --> 11:44.990
for Rafael and Mateo Gallardo
to make their way down to the pier,

11:44.990 --> 11:46.240
find a hiding spot,

11:46.240 --> 11:50.953
and wait for an unsuspecting casino
boat patron, like Brooks McCutcheon.

11:51.913 --> 11:53.206
And seize upon him.

11:54.666 --> 11:56.834
I'd like to thank you, Mr. Walsh,
for your appearance here today

11:57.252 --> 11:59.169
and for your work every day
on behalf of this city.

11:59.169 --> 12:00.296
You're welcome.

12:02.757 --> 12:05.635
Jury bought what he said.
Don't push too hard.

12:07.469 --> 12:10.889
Mr. Walsh, when the boys
got off the bus,

12:10.889 --> 12:13.892
did you see
which direction they walked?

12:14.728 --> 12:16.146
Towards the ocean, I guess.

12:19.649 --> 12:20.984
I'm sorry, you guess?

12:21.901 --> 12:25.447
You guess?
But you don't know?

12:27.866 --> 12:29.868
Did you have any contact with them
after they got off?

12:29.868 --> 12:31.119
No.

12:31.119 --> 12:32.494
Did you ask them where they were
headed?

12:32.494 --> 12:34.289
Did they just say,
"We're off to kill Brooks McCutcheon."

12:34.289 --> 12:38.168
- Objection, compound argumentative.
- Sustained. Mr. Mason...

12:38.626 --> 12:40.003
Apologies, rephrase.

12:40.711 --> 12:43.589
Mr. Walsh, outside of seeing the boys
get off the bus at a specific time,

12:43.589 --> 12:48.052
what else can you tell us that you know
they did or did not do that night?

12:49.053 --> 12:51.890
- I guess nothing.
- Right.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.433
They could've gone
a thousand different directions,

12:54.433 --> 12:55.685
done a thousand different things.

12:55.685 --> 12:57.228
You're currently
in a very packed courtroom.

12:57.561 --> 12:59.981
If a crime is committed a mile away
from here in a couple hours,

12:59.981 --> 13:01.815
you gonna testify one of us did it

13:01.815 --> 13:05.070
'cause you see us here now,
or are you going to guess?

13:07.071 --> 13:10.991
Sure, if they look as shifty
as you do, Mr. Maggot.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.003
Look, don't start reading
into anything.

13:24.129 --> 13:26.632
- But they laughed at you.
- No, they laughed at what he said.

13:26.632 --> 13:29.218
And that guy was a prick,
pardon my language.

13:29.218 --> 13:31.971
I saw the way some of the jury
was looking at the boys.

13:31.971 --> 13:35.599
- Why didn't you object more?
- There was nothing to object to.

13:36.851 --> 13:39.980
My job now is to show the jury
anyone else

13:39.980 --> 13:43.233
that might be responsible
for killing Brooks.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.401
Like who?

13:44.901 --> 13:48.362
I don't know.
Just another suspect to focus on.

13:49.655 --> 13:51.115
Mr. Mason.

13:54.994 --> 13:59.666
What if there was someone else
who wanted him dead?

14:05.337 --> 14:07.548
I didn't know where else to keep it.

14:10.594 --> 14:15.307
I thought if I kept it under here,
maybe God would protect it.

14:22.104 --> 14:24.941
- How much?
- 2,000 dollars.

14:32.948 --> 14:35.201
I think I should hold onto this.

14:48.798 --> 14:51.300
- Sixth and Spring.
- You got it, sir.

15:02.479 --> 15:05.982
I couldn't tell when the women
knew they were hired

15:05.982 --> 15:08.025
either obviously before the murder,

15:08.025 --> 15:10.278
or whether the boys confessed
because they got caught.

15:10.278 --> 15:14.114
Murder for hire? How are you not
more upset about this?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.367
Believe me, I am.

15:15.367 --> 15:18.827
But that whole robbery gone wrong
bullshit never sat right with me.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.412
This makes sense.

15:20.412 --> 15:23.833
Now all we have to do is find out
who wanted Brooks dead.

15:24.209 --> 15:26.251
Two Gs, that's not chicken feed.

15:26.919 --> 15:30.589
Holcomb maybe. He's never been shy
about taking payoffs.

15:31.966 --> 15:34.010
What about Councilman Taylor?

15:34.010 --> 15:37.346
A civil servant salary covering that?
I don't know.

15:37.346 --> 15:40.057
But with all the kickbacks
those boys get?

15:40.684 --> 15:43.520
And he did turn six shades of red
when I brought up Brooks.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.563
Right, so Brooks somehow
wrongs Taylor's sister.

15:46.563 --> 15:47.941
Hold on, speculative.

15:47.941 --> 15:50.901
The councilman wants payback, has
to make it look like anything but a hit

15:50.901 --> 15:52.529
so the McCutcheons
don't suspect him.

15:52.529 --> 15:54.990
So, he hires two young guys,
probably at arm's length.

15:54.990 --> 15:57.742
They knock off Brooks.
No one's the wiser.

16:03.122 --> 16:05.292
- What?
- It's conjecture, all of it.

16:05.292 --> 16:08.795
I know! Della, we need something.
We need a roadmap.

16:09.253 --> 16:11.505
But first,
we need to talk to our clients.

16:11.505 --> 16:15.426
Well, then we better start walking.
We're due in court in 25 minutes.

16:16.011 --> 16:17.554
We'll have to ask for recess.

16:17.554 --> 16:20.515
Then we'll need a damn good reason.
The judge won't just grant us one.

16:20.515 --> 16:24.101
- Make some shit up.
- Well, isn't that your department?

16:24.101 --> 16:25.311
Fair.

16:37.907 --> 16:39.366
All rise.

16:48.168 --> 16:49.418
- Be seated.
- Your Honor...

16:49.418 --> 16:52.421
Your Honor, the people would like
to request a recess

16:52.421 --> 16:55.467
so we may confer with defense counsel.

16:58.053 --> 17:01.473
Life in prison for both
with no chance for parole

17:01.473 --> 17:04.558
regardless of which one admits
to pulling the trigger.

17:04.976 --> 17:07.811
The Gallardos
will be placed in San Quentin,

17:08.355 --> 17:12.317
no petitioning to be moved
to a more lenient site

17:12.317 --> 17:15.403
at any point during the entire length
of the incarceration.

17:15.403 --> 17:17.113
You mean their lifetimes?

17:17.113 --> 17:21.701
The brothers must confess in open court
to the events of the evening,

17:21.701 --> 17:23.870
plead guilty to all charges,

17:24.745 --> 17:29.792
and allow their elocution
to be broadcast on the radio.

17:33.797 --> 17:36.549
- It's a good offer.
- Ms. Street's right.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.842
I just wanna know
why you're making it.

17:38.842 --> 17:40.094
Yeah.

17:40.094 --> 17:42.931
Cause you were right, Della,
they're just kids.

17:43.347 --> 17:44.724
We've had enough suffering.

17:44.724 --> 17:48.645
The McCutcheon family, and yes,
even the Gallardo family.

17:49.019 --> 17:52.940
This trial is already
putting the city on edge.

17:52.940 --> 17:56.403
And you were right too, Mason.
I don't want things getting ugly.

17:56.403 --> 17:58.946
Compassion is also part of my job.

17:59.281 --> 18:04.118
Then let them suffer a little less.
25, and they come up for parole in 15.

18:04.118 --> 18:08.957
Not a chance. No, no, no. Anything less,
I would get strung up along with 'em.

18:08.957 --> 18:12.751
- 30, and they're eligible in...
- Hamilton... What is all this?

18:13.920 --> 18:16.630
Because up until today,
you were the hang 'em high guy.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.800
- Suddenly you're the prince of mercy?
- You don't like the deal?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.344
You can let the train go by
and take your chances on foot.

18:22.344 --> 18:25.849
I know you want me to.
You gotta hate this deal.

18:25.849 --> 18:27.349
Doesn't matter what he thinks.

18:27.349 --> 18:31.979
What I'm offering gets the death penalty
off the table, saves your clients' lives.

18:31.979 --> 18:36.818
It's the best you're gonna do
and as much as I am ever going to offer.

18:37.152 --> 18:41.323
Take it to your clients.
Get back to me by the end of the day.

18:46.660 --> 18:49.246
Hamilton could barely look me
in the eye.

18:49.581 --> 18:51.249
- Who got to him?
- I don't know.

18:51.249 --> 18:54.126
Lydell, the councilman?
Who else could it be?

18:55.128 --> 18:59.173
- What do they know that we don't?
- And why would Ham give in to them?

19:06.848 --> 19:09.434
It wasn't just about getting some money.

19:10.059 --> 19:13.187
Then what was it? Truth this time.

19:14.439 --> 19:17.567
You know that big stadium
they built a few years ago?

19:18.568 --> 19:20.654
McCutcheon's Stadium? Sure.

19:21.278 --> 19:25.116
That used to be our neighborhood.
Our whole family lived there.

19:26.283 --> 19:29.537
The police they came in.

19:30.872 --> 19:33.749
Like stampeding bulls, not giving
a shit what they stomped on.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.876
LAPD, open up!

19:35.876 --> 19:38.380
You're all trespassing
on McCutcheon property!

19:38.754 --> 19:40.173
Police!

19:40.798 --> 19:42.925
Leave my brother alone!

19:42.925 --> 19:46.137
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Burn it to the ground!

19:53.060 --> 19:54.521
Light it up!

19:59.526 --> 20:01.402
And in all the confusion...

20:02.654 --> 20:04.279
...we lost sight of our little sister.

20:04.279 --> 20:08.660
- Where's Rossana?
- Rossana! Rossana!

20:11.287 --> 20:12.539
Rossana!

20:14.124 --> 20:15.584
Rossana!

20:18.585 --> 20:20.630
I could hear her screaming...

20:24.341 --> 20:25.760
until I couldn't.

20:32.809 --> 20:35.729
I'm sorry. I can't even imagine.

20:41.817 --> 20:43.862
The DA has offered a deal.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.285
You both plead guilty.

20:51.785 --> 20:53.078
Life, no parole.

20:55.456 --> 20:57.541
- What if we don't take it?
- Rafa.

20:57.541 --> 20:58.919
What would happen?

20:58.919 --> 21:01.004
You can't escape justice.
You killed a man.

21:01.004 --> 21:03.964
Yes, but out of desperation.
And out of hunger.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.426
- I hated him.
- We weren't the only ones.

21:10.639 --> 21:14.725
You took a life, for whatever reason.
There's no taking that back.

21:15.684 --> 21:20.273
But like you just said, your finger
wasn't the only one on that trigger.

21:21.732 --> 21:25.110
Now, whoever's pressuring the DA
has got clout.

21:25.987 --> 21:29.281
And if they're pushing Burger
with just what we know,

21:29.281 --> 21:32.993
what happens when we dig in and get
closer to who's really behind this?

21:32.993 --> 21:35.829
It'll make the DA offer something better.

21:35.829 --> 21:38.874
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I would.

21:39.376 --> 21:42.420
- Well, we don't know anything more.
- You know who hired you.

21:42.963 --> 21:45.214
That's the first rung on the ladder.

21:47.299 --> 21:48.801
All I need is a name.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.179
I'm in.

21:54.848 --> 21:57.226
- What about you, Mateo?
- I don't know.

21:59.145 --> 22:00.438
It's risky.

22:00.438 --> 22:03.066
So? What, you want to take the deal?

22:03.066 --> 22:04.859
At least Maria would still have
a father she can come and see!

22:04.859 --> 22:06.318
I won't die in here.

22:07.529 --> 22:11.573
And it's like Mr. Mason said,
we don't have to go down for this alone.

22:12.117 --> 22:14.244
But he can't guarantee anything.

22:15.452 --> 22:17.454
- Can you?
- No.

22:24.713 --> 22:27.673
If we lose, you go to the gallows.
I go home.

22:29.593 --> 22:31.552
So, you decide if you trust me.

22:41.228 --> 22:43.314
- They're not taking it.
- No?

22:45.149 --> 22:47.484
This is good news. For both of us.

22:48.945 --> 22:50.196
Tommy.

22:51.031 --> 22:54.951
Mason passed the bar
with only a few hours studying.

22:57.119 --> 22:59.163
He's a lot craftier than you think.

23:10.091 --> 23:11.384
Here he comes.

23:11.384 --> 23:15.221
I'm sorry. Took a couple hours
for the boys to give up a name.

23:16.472 --> 23:17.849
Ozzie Jackson.

23:18.223 --> 23:20.100
He has rackets up on Central.

23:20.643 --> 23:23.897
Central? I don't figure a guy like that's
got beef with somebody like Brooks.

23:23.897 --> 23:26.149
- We looking at a middleman.
- Right.

23:26.942 --> 23:29.319
Now we have a real chance
to get 'em a better deal.

23:29.319 --> 23:31.905
Yesterday we would've killed
for any deal.

23:31.905 --> 23:35.867
Della... I know
how to fight this now. I do.

23:36.660 --> 23:39.246
Did you happen to get a description
of this Ozzie Jackson fella?

23:39.246 --> 23:42.247
Yeah. Said you'll recognize him
by his feet.

23:42.874 --> 23:45.584
He's always wearing
Converse sneakers.

23:57.180 --> 23:58.265
Hey.

23:58.848 --> 24:02.185
You seen a grown man
in sneakers working Central?

24:02.185 --> 24:04.521
You figured my outta work
ass hanging on the corners

24:04.521 --> 24:07.190
with the hustlers and shit heels now?

24:12.279 --> 24:13.570
Don't you worry, Mo.

24:13.905 --> 24:16.992
Clara's been looking at apartments.
We'll be outta here real soon.

24:22.038 --> 24:23.331
Ain't no rush.

24:24.665 --> 24:25.959
Let me see.

24:33.632 --> 24:38.471
Yeah. Central and 43rd.
He's part of Perkins' crew.

24:39.681 --> 24:42.892
You sure you want to be sticking
your nose in all that?

24:45.645 --> 24:49.608
This case starting
to feel bigger than me.

24:52.818 --> 24:57.323
The guy ain't saying much, now is he?
Let me see that bicep again, Paul.

24:58.491 --> 25:00.243
Shut the fuck up.

25:04.205 --> 25:05.623
Thank you, Mo.

25:06.791 --> 25:08.126
Anytime.

25:16.009 --> 25:18.886
- A fella in Converse sneakers?
- No.

25:56.925 --> 25:58.342
Mr. Perkins.

26:21.866 --> 26:23.367
Where'd you get these?

26:23.785 --> 26:26.245
I got those from the fella
that took 'em.

26:26.245 --> 26:27.496
Those and all the other ones

26:27.496 --> 26:31.042
that's got you jammed up
with them crackers downtown.

26:31.585 --> 26:34.421
Never had one damn problem
down here. Ran clean.

26:34.837 --> 26:38.215
Now? I got eyes on me everywhere.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.468
Just waiting for Old Perkins to act

26:40.468 --> 26:43.137
like the gangster nigga
they want me to be.

26:45.390 --> 26:51.186
Mr. Perkins, word is Ozzie Jackson
the one paid them Mexican boys

26:52.689 --> 26:55.399
to push the button
on that McCutcheon kid.

26:56.150 --> 26:58.485
And Mr. Perkins,
somebody paid Ozzie.

26:58.986 --> 27:03.532
And I guess whatever he got,
he must've forgot to cut Mr. Perkins in.

27:05.201 --> 27:06.411
How much he get?

27:06.411 --> 27:08.830
I won't know that
'til you help me find him.

27:08.830 --> 27:12.167
However, if I know about Ozzie,

27:12.833 --> 27:15.545
then it's only a matter of time
'til the DA know.

27:15.545 --> 27:17.004
And if he connect that to you,

27:17.004 --> 27:23.344
then, Mr. Perkins, we ain't just talking
'bout no years at San Quentin.

27:23.344 --> 27:25.596
We talking 'bout a trip to the noose.

27:27.015 --> 27:31.478
Now, I know you out on bail until
the trial for those racketeering charges.

27:32.228 --> 27:35.522
Only person that can testify
to the authenticity of these photos

27:35.522 --> 27:37.066
is him what took 'em.

27:37.650 --> 27:42.447
And if he keep quiet, all the evidence
they got against you get thrown out.

27:42.989 --> 27:48.245
So you help me get with Ozzie, and
I'm gonna help you get with Mr. Snaps.

27:50.497 --> 27:51.997
That's a fairtrade.

28:56.854 --> 29:00.900
The center ridges come from the right
and exit the same side here.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.861
And this you would say is a
distinguishing characteristic

29:03.861 --> 29:05.572
of Rafael Gallardo's fingerprint?

29:05.572 --> 29:06.822
Yes.

29:06.822 --> 29:08.866
Now, just so we're very clear
for the jury,

29:09.242 --> 29:12.162
it's basically impossible for two people

29:12.162 --> 29:14.079
to have the exact
same fingerprint pattern?

29:14.456 --> 29:15.623
That is correct.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.335
Now, Mr. Barston, there is a photograph
just to the left of the jury

29:19.835 --> 29:21.796
of the steering wheel
of Mr. McCutcheon's car

29:21.796 --> 29:23.213
where a fingerprint was found.

29:23.213 --> 29:26.134
Now, you've compared that
with Mr. Gallardo's, correct?

29:26.134 --> 29:27.469
- Yes.
- And what did you conclude?

29:27.469 --> 29:30.847
The loop pattern
and individual characteristics,

29:30.847 --> 29:33.516
I've identified 12 of them, all match.

29:34.059 --> 29:35.225
Meaning?

29:35.225 --> 29:38.688
The print on the steering wheel
is Rafael Gallardo's.

29:39.522 --> 29:41.148
Thank you, Mr. Barston.

29:43.151 --> 29:47.280
Mr. Barston. Would you mind
if we did a little experiment?

29:47.822 --> 29:50.532
- Experiment?
- Yes. A fingerprint experiment.

29:50.532 --> 29:54.203
Your Honor, this is a courtroom,
not a grammar school science lesson.

29:54.203 --> 29:56.122
What is the purpose of this, Mr. Mason?

29:56.122 --> 29:58.916
I'm trying to establish
not just what fingerprints look like

29:58.916 --> 30:00.669
but how this whole process works.

30:00.669 --> 30:02.878
And I do think
it's necessary for the jury

30:02.878 --> 30:04.047
to fully understand the evidence.

30:04.588 --> 30:07.133
- Keep it brief.
- Thank you, Your Honor. May I?

30:07.634 --> 30:09.843
Thank you. Now, Mr. Barston.

30:10.762 --> 30:15.015
Would you please choose a thumb
and place it firmly on this ink blotter?

30:15.015 --> 30:19.269
Thank you. Now, would you place
that thumb down on this piece of paper?

30:20.020 --> 30:24.400
Perfect. Take that same thumb,
press it on the ink blotter once again.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.069
Now, instead of placing it down
on that piece of paper,

30:27.696 --> 30:33.702
this time could you please place it
on this piece of tape, sticky-side up?

30:36.121 --> 30:38.456
Thank you. Now, Mr. Barston,

30:39.499 --> 30:43.920
when you look at the two images of your
own thumb, what do you notice?

30:43.920 --> 30:46.630
One is slightly more smudged
than the other.

30:47.131 --> 30:48.341
Nothing else?

30:48.341 --> 30:50.594
Well, because you used the tape,
one is backwards.

30:50.594 --> 30:55.098
One is backwards.
Precisely. One is backwards.

30:55.098 --> 30:56.807
Now, with that in mind,

30:58.142 --> 31:00.103
would you please take a closer look

31:00.520 --> 31:03.772
at this photograph
of Rafael Gallardo's left forefinger

31:03.772 --> 31:06.734
and the other,
same finger, same fingerprint

31:06.734 --> 31:09.487
but discovered on Brooks McCutcheon's
steering wheel,

31:09.487 --> 31:11.281
and tell me the difference?

31:11.613 --> 31:13.533
I don't see any difference.

31:13.533 --> 31:17.037
And you're right because they're
a match. But there is one problem.

31:17.037 --> 31:20.998
This image was developed
with a backward negative.

31:20.998 --> 31:22.374
Now, we know this

31:22.374 --> 31:26.046
because the numbers and letters on
the side of the negative are reversed.

31:26.046 --> 31:30.842
Pretty hard to see, so I took
the liberty of blowing them up.

31:31.925 --> 31:34.930
This is the corrected image.

31:36.430 --> 31:39.516
Now, with that corrected image in mind,

31:40.309 --> 31:42.771
would you please, Mr. Barston,

31:43.772 --> 31:46.857
take another look at these two images

31:49.943 --> 31:51.947
and tell me the difference.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.657
The fingerprint is backwards.

31:55.449 --> 31:57.452
The fingerprint is backwards.

31:57.452 --> 31:59.412
Mr. Barston, is it possible

31:59.870 --> 32:02.748
that the defendant
could place his own fingerprint

32:02.748 --> 32:05.001
on the steering wheel backwards?

32:06.085 --> 32:08.253
No. It's not possible naturally.

32:08.253 --> 32:12.341
Only someone who had taken his
fingerprint and tried to transfer it could

32:12.341 --> 32:15.302
so that it would produce
a mirror image, am I correct?

32:15.302 --> 32:16.553
Yes.

32:16.553 --> 32:18.223
Someone like the police
or Mr. Milligan's investigators.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.016
Objection, complete speculation!

32:20.600 --> 32:23.102
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you.

32:24.020 --> 32:27.982
Sustained. The jury will disregard
Mr. Mason's latest comment.

32:30.485 --> 32:31.986
- Order!
- No, they won't.

32:42.163 --> 32:45.541
- I'm not sure I should be doing this.
- Just trust me.

33:18.907 --> 33:21.536
I'm going to meet some of my friends.

33:42.556 --> 33:43.891
Are you enjoying it?

33:44.642 --> 33:47.269
- Immensely.
- Good.

33:48.354 --> 33:51.440
You deserve it
after your heroics in court today.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.401
That was mostly Perry.

33:56.196 --> 33:58.989
Was he in the courtroom?
I hadn't noticed.

34:10.709 --> 34:13.128
- I almost forgot.
- What?

34:14.088 --> 34:15.590
I love you too.

34:49.081 --> 34:50.250
Hello.

34:50.250 --> 34:54.503
Hi. Now, I know the dip you brought
over didn't quite curl your toes,

34:54.503 --> 34:58.424
but these are pickles from Canter
Brothers on Brooklyn Avenue.

35:00.176 --> 35:03.221
That's much more romantic
than flowers. Thank you.

35:03.221 --> 35:04.471
You're welcome.

35:06.891 --> 35:08.809
You have a nice place.

35:09.185 --> 35:10.477
Thank you.

35:14.399 --> 35:17.693
- Is there anything you don't do?
- Small talk.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.240
Noted.

35:23.617 --> 35:27.411
I heard on the radio things went well
for you in court today.

35:28.830 --> 35:33.001
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
we might've turned a corner.

35:36.254 --> 35:40.090
I guess you might have
more of a case than you thought?

35:42.052 --> 35:43.218
I guess.

35:45.429 --> 35:49.267
- Do you want a hand?
- I do.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.144
Okay.

35:52.896 --> 35:56.315
Take off your shirt.
Might get dirty.

36:09.370 --> 36:11.372
Yeah, yeah.
I can get there.

36:12.957 --> 36:15.919
How'd you find me? Okay.

36:21.507 --> 36:22.634
I'll be back soon.

36:26.930 --> 36:28.348
Sorry.

36:57.085 --> 36:58.502
Right this way.

37:08.471 --> 37:10.181
Our inquiring man.

37:17.981 --> 37:20.025
- I don't know you.
- You do now.

37:20.525 --> 37:23.319
So, accommodate our guest.
Go ahead.

37:28.073 --> 37:31.036
You paid the Gallardo brothers
to shoot Brooks McCutcheon?

37:31.036 --> 37:33.454
What? Man, I'm not talking
to this nigga.

37:34.122 --> 37:38.293
You gonna answer every question
this man's got. One way or the other.

37:40.753 --> 37:42.630
Now, hold up, professor.

37:42.630 --> 37:45.424
Before we get to the other side
of this conversation,

37:45.424 --> 37:47.926
I think you need to pay your admission.

37:47.926 --> 37:51.096
So now, who's my Judas?

37:54.017 --> 37:55.977
I'm afraid you lookin' at him.

37:57.687 --> 38:00.106
Now, it wasn't supposed
to go the way that it did,

38:00.106 --> 38:02.608
but I ain't gonna testify against you.
You got my word.

38:02.608 --> 38:06.863
- Your word? That it?
- That's all I got. What else you need?

38:06.863 --> 38:09.740
I need you to understand
whose kingdom you in.

38:10.492 --> 38:12.577
I ain't mean no disrespect,
Mr. Perkins.

38:12.577 --> 38:16.331
- And yet disrespect lingers in the air.
- Come on, now.

38:16.331 --> 38:21.544
Now, whoa. Let's see
what Mr. Word's really made of.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.672
You want answers?

38:23.672 --> 38:26.507
You gonna have to put a beat
on the man 'til your first ache.

38:26.507 --> 38:27.675
What... wait, what?

38:28.592 --> 38:31.136
- Hey! Hey, hold on!
- What if I don't?

38:32.055 --> 38:35.725
Then I'mma cut your fist clean off
to the fucking bone.

38:43.607 --> 38:45.359
I ain't got nothing to do with this.

38:45.359 --> 38:47.319
I don't even know
what you talking about.

38:47.319 --> 38:49.698
Mr. Perkins, please.
I never disrespect you, man.

38:49.698 --> 38:52.616
You known me since a kid.
Mr. Perkins, please.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.124
Look at me.

39:00.709 --> 39:03.043
Did you pay the Gallardo brothers?

39:07.924 --> 39:11.844
- Who paid you to do a hit?
- I don't know his name.

39:17.851 --> 39:19.311
Who? Who?

39:20.061 --> 39:22.813
Some fancy cracker
I had dealings with before.

39:22.813 --> 39:26.192
- Wait, what you mean before?
- He got a hophead for a wife.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.862
Coming down for years to score.

39:29.362 --> 39:31.031
Two, three times a week.

39:31.031 --> 39:33.116
He found out and paid me
to stop selling dope to her.

39:33.491 --> 39:37.120
I ain't seen him
since he came for the snuff job.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.580
- How much you get then?
- Oh, man.

39:50.424 --> 39:51.760
10 Gs!

39:52.468 --> 39:56.096
Okay, and then you gave two grand
to the Gallardos off the top?

39:56.096 --> 39:58.975
You brought all that heat down here
and didn't kick nothing back to me?

39:58.975 --> 40:00.392
- Nigga...
- Wait, wait.

40:00.392 --> 40:04.314
Okay, what about the deal? The deal.
You stopped selling H to his wife.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.065
She ain't been around in a while.

40:06.065 --> 40:08.860
But if she ain't dead,
they always come back.

40:09.402 --> 40:12.363
Listen, look at me.
What kinda car she drive?

40:12.821 --> 40:16.116
I don't know the make.
Lincoln maybe. Blue thing.

40:16.116 --> 40:18.245
- That's all I can tell you.
- Okay, okay, okay.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.372
- Fuck!
- Okay.

40:21.039 --> 40:24.209
- I got everything I need now.
- I don't think you did.

40:24.917 --> 40:27.002
Look like this boy
still holding out on you.

40:27.796 --> 40:31.006
So, we ain't leaving
until you get a full confession.

40:32.509 --> 40:34.594
And he atone for his sin.

40:35.011 --> 40:38.305
Come on man. Motherfucker,
I told you everything I know! Please!

40:38.305 --> 40:41.351
Hey, you ain't gotta do this!
Please, man!

40:46.606 --> 40:47.898
Please stop!

40:48.566 --> 40:51.194
Stop, please! No!

41:37.781 --> 41:39.159
You okay?

41:39.908 --> 41:41.619
Yeah. Yeah.

41:45.832 --> 41:47.417
What's wrong?

41:54.883 --> 41:56.175
Clara...

42:02.682 --> 42:04.142
Am I good?

42:08.313 --> 42:09.772
You're good, baby.

42:13.610 --> 42:14.943
You're good.

42:27.373 --> 42:28.667
Rest.

42:30.084 --> 42:32.169
- Rest, baby.
- Okay.

42:49.311 --> 42:52.398
- You wanted to see me, boss?
- Give me a moment.

43:10.666 --> 43:13.335
- How well do you know Mason?
- I know him.

43:14.045 --> 43:15.754
Do you two talk shop?

43:17.757 --> 43:19.049
We used to.

43:20.009 --> 43:21.510
When we had a few.

43:25.432 --> 43:26.932
Shut the door.

43:46.912 --> 43:48.330
Hey.

43:49.497 --> 43:50.831
Where were you last night?

43:50.831 --> 43:54.628
Perry and I were at the office all night
preparing the files for today

43:55.044 --> 44:00.132
and strategizing on how to cut through
the jury's preconceived bias.

44:00.132 --> 44:03.427
I'm confident on who we settled on,
but still.

44:03.761 --> 44:05.846
You weren't at the office, Della.

44:06.806 --> 44:08.057
I called.

44:11.185 --> 44:13.021
We must not have heard
the phone ringing.

44:13.355 --> 44:15.982
If something's going on,
then just tell me.

44:18.109 --> 44:19.526
I...

44:22.571 --> 44:23.782
I was working.

44:27.118 --> 44:28.911
You fucking coward.

44:34.376 --> 44:35.751
Shit.
