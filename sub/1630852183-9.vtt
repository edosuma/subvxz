WEBVTT

00:10.594 --> 00:12.930
is holding 13 secrets,

00:12.930 --> 00:16.600
five of which they've never
admitted to a living soul.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.853
[Quinn] Tye, are sure you are
feeling up for this?

00:18.853 --> 00:20.104
[Tye] Yes, I feel good.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.314
I was cooped up in the house
for a week.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.066
So wait. Any word
from your husband?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.943
- Um...
[Quinn] That's a sentence

00:25.943 --> 00:27.361
I never thought
I would say to you.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.696
[Tye]
Listen, it's all good.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.324
He signed the divorce papers,
and he left, so...

00:32.324 --> 00:33.576
You good?

00:33.576 --> 00:35.202
Question is, are you good?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.288
I still think
you should be taking it easy.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.581
Here we are!

00:38.581 --> 00:41.083
[Camille] Oh, well, now I think
we should... get in.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.084
That's what I'm talking about.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.043
Okay, see our girl.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.046
[rhythmic percussion playing]

00:53.053 --> 00:54.346
Oh, look at Angie.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.311
[sighs] You guys, I think that
this is gonna be really good.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.772
- That was bad.
- That was really bad.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.815
[Quinn]
Like, really, really bad.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.192
Dear God.

01:06.192 --> 01:08.527
God ain't had nothing to do
with that mess.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.154
Why would they change
the ending like that?

01:10.154 --> 01:13.365
I mean, the brother dies and
the white girl gets redeemed?

01:13.365 --> 01:15.367
[Quinn] Oh, hey.
[Camille] Hey.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.286
[Quinn] You were so good.
[Camille] So good, girl.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.580
[Quinn] Great job.
[Tye] With your fine ass.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.081
What do we tell her?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.667
Not the truth.
We take this shit to the grave.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.794
Right.

01:24.794 --> 01:28.547
[all cheering]

01:28.547 --> 01:30.925
[Angie]
Thank you for coming.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.051
Yes.

01:32.051 --> 01:34.428
So...
were y'all feeling it?

01:34.428 --> 01:37.807
Girl, l-look, you--
you was up there!

01:37.807 --> 01:39.600
[Angie] Oh!
- You was up there, okay.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.726
- Up.
- Yes.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.437
- And you stuck! Okay!
- [laughter]

01:43.437 --> 01:45.898
You know,
that beginning part...

01:45.898 --> 01:47.191
was music!

01:47.191 --> 01:50.319
- For real?
- It was an experience.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.862
[Tye] Yes.
- Ooh, I like that.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.781
Y'all did
what y'all had to do!

01:53.781 --> 01:55.950
Oh, I'm so happy.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.410
Listen, I have a notes meeting
with the director.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.412
[Tye] Ooh.
- I will be right back.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.455
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.832
I have to go do
the actor things.

02:02.832 --> 02:05.334
[laughter]

02:05.334 --> 02:07.920
Maybe I should give
that director some notes.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.548
I feel so bad. I've never
lied to her like this before.

02:10.548 --> 02:13.050
- I forgot my bouquet.
- Ooh, yes, okay.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.844
Love y'all so much.
This is beautiful.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.847
[Tye] Okay.
They all need to know.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.932
Hey, get
that Tony Award, girl!

02:19.932 --> 02:21.475
[laughs]

02:21.475 --> 02:24.895
Bitch, you know
you done went too far.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.647
I just wish
this could somehow keep

02:26.647 --> 02:27.815
her career momentum going.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.233
I mean, you know
how down she gets.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.860
I know, but, you know,

02:30.860 --> 02:33.487
maybe she can go with me
to the screening tonight.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.864
I heard that the director

02:34.864 --> 02:36.782
is supposed to be
the next big deal.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.992
I mean, y'all can come, too.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.702
I wish I could,
but I promised Shawn

02:39.702 --> 02:41.328
that I was gonna babysit
J.J. tonight.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.538
[both]
Wait.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.874
You said a stripper
was a deal breaker,

02:44.874 --> 02:46.250
then you said a stripper
with a kid

02:46.250 --> 02:47.751
was the ultimate dealbreaker,

02:47.751 --> 02:50.838
and now you're babysitting
aforementioned stripper's kid?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.299
Oh, my gosh, can we just
change the subject?

02:53.299 --> 02:54.925
No, you were the one who said

02:54.925 --> 02:56.886
that you wanted us to take
your problems more seriously.

02:56.886 --> 02:59.096
Okay, fine.
[sighs]

02:59.096 --> 03:01.473
- I like him a lot...
- [Camille] Aw.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.809
...but his kid
doesn't like me a lot.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.853
- Yikes.
- Everybody likes you.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.438
Yeah, except for kids
and my mom.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.772
- [scoffs]
- Yeah.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.524
But I just got to get this kid
to really, really like me,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.484
or else sweet,
sweet Shawn will find out

03:12.484 --> 03:15.696
that I don't have
one maternal bone in my body.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.197
Then he's gonna
break up with me.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.284
So, Cam, would you like to go
to the screening with me?

03:20.284 --> 03:21.452
Uh, I can't.

03:21.452 --> 03:24.079
I, um, have a-a meet-up
with someone.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.497
Jameson?

03:25.497 --> 03:28.083
No, um, Ian.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.337
Wait, does Jameson know
that you're hanging with Ian?

03:31.337 --> 03:33.839
I am helping him find art
for his restaurant

03:33.839 --> 03:35.132
and I just don't want
to make it

03:35.132 --> 03:36.634
into something
when it's nothing.

03:36.634 --> 03:37.843
I don't think Ian texting you,

03:37.843 --> 03:39.803
"Are we making a mistake?"
is nothing.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.347
- [cell phone chimes]
- Oh, look the car is here.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.640
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, there we go.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.933
You just want to change
the subject when we trying...

03:43.933 --> 03:45.309
I am not changing
the subject.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.644
I'm just saying
it's a nothing thing.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.312
[Quinn] I mean, did you respond
to his text yet?

03:48.312 --> 03:50.940
[Camille] No, as usual,
I overanalyzed what to say

03:50.940 --> 03:52.650
to the point of where
I didn't say anything at all,

03:52.650 --> 03:53.943
and now too much time
has passed.

03:53.943 --> 03:56.278
- [driver] For James?
- [Camille] No.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.738
Wrong Uber again.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
[Tye] He knew we weren't
no goddamn James.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.950
[Quinn] Right.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.664
Hey, Cam, it's Jameson.

04:06.664 --> 04:09.166
I'm picking up some Chinese.
Your place in an hour?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.966
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.425
I wasn't doing anything.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.843
Oh, I wasn't either.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.305
So, um, look, thanks.
Thanks for doing this for me.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.848
Thanks for an extra check.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.351
You know, the student-loan debt
isn't gonna pay for itself.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.187
- Oh, Louis! Salut.
- Hello.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.355
- Hey.
- [Camille chuckles]

04:31.355 --> 04:32.940
- So good to see you again.
- Oh!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.650
Oh, someone's been pre-gaming?

04:34.650 --> 04:38.654
I am excited to see the
Afro-American art of Harlem.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.197
Uh, me too.
Shall we?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.615
Yes, we shall.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.204
Ooh, Ace of the Coma.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.580
That look like
the ace of hearts to me.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.082
[Camille]
Yep, you should buy it.

04:50.082 --> 04:53.585
You know, this is giving me,
like, two worlds colliding.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.004
- You know?
- Mm-hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.672
Like, Paris, Harlem,
that's...

04:56.672 --> 04:57.923
Harlem.

04:59.675 --> 05:03.345
Hmm.
A Tête à Tête. Hmm.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.472
So, "Here the artist
has imagined a conversation

05:05.472 --> 05:07.599
between Coretta Scott King
and Rosa Parks.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.352
The red background evokes
the backdrop of bloodshed

05:10.352 --> 05:12.187
that led both women
to take active roles

05:12.187 --> 05:13.355
in the Civil Rights Movement."

05:13.355 --> 05:16.275
Hmm. It's perfect.
You should take it.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.652
It's two teacups.
How does that feel Harlem?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.905
Well, um, because
what if the two women

05:21.905 --> 05:23.240
had been in the same room,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.117
what would they have said
to each other?

05:25.117 --> 05:26.660
I'm pretty sure
they probably ran

05:26.660 --> 05:28.370
in the same social circles.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.040
But it's important,
and it's Harlem,

05:31.040 --> 05:32.207
and you should take it.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.921
You know, I feel like you
just rushing through this.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.049
Are you uncomfortable?
Like, what's goin' on with you?

05:40.049 --> 05:42.801
Nothing is going on.
This is me in...in work.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.678
You know, I'm in...
I'm in work mode.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.515
Oh, there you are.
Oh, Ian, I was...there you are.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.352
I have just seen the most
breathtaking piece of art.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.065
It is a sculpture
that is shaped like a vulva.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.483
Guess how much I paid for it.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.485
- How much?
- $23,000.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.070
- Wait a minute
- [Camille] Oh.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.237
Hey, I mean, it sounds nice,

06:02.237 --> 06:03.989
but, you know,
I just don't know if a...

06:03.989 --> 06:05.532
if a vulva is really gonna
blend in with the other art.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.451
No, no.
I bought it for myself.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.827
- Oh.
- Did you and Josephine

06:08.827 --> 06:11.038
find any art with local charm?

06:11.038 --> 06:13.123
Yes, we did. We...we actually
found a bunch of stuff.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.666
I think we're
pretty much done.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.293
We still got the art
to see upstairs, so...

06:16.293 --> 06:17.878
- [Louis] Right.
- [both] Great.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.797
I'm gonna go grab my vulva,
and I'll meet you guys.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.090
- Yep, let's...
- All right.

06:21.090 --> 06:24.051
...check it out, okay.
[chuckles awkwardly]

06:24.051 --> 06:25.219
Fuck.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.096
How many floors
does this place have?

06:27.096 --> 06:28.305
[Ian]
About four.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.473
[Shawn]
So you good?

06:29.473 --> 06:32.309
Of course.
Look...

06:32.309 --> 06:34.895
Aren't we gonna have fun, J.J.?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.522
Yay.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.898
Look, it really means
the world to me

06:37.898 --> 06:39.066
that you're cool
with watching him.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.567
Oh, it is not even
a thing, okay?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.820
He's important to you,
so he's important to me.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.905
That's what I love about you.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.033
That's what I love
about me, too.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.077
- Yuck!
- Yuck!

06:50.077 --> 06:51.411
Bye, guys.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.289
Don't let him watch
that Kindle the whole time.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.916
Oh, don't worry.
I got it.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.001
Hey, and, J.J.,
listen to her, young man.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.129
- She's in charge, okay?
- He's fine.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.214
All right, bye, babe.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.507
Bye. See you.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.262
So, J.J.,
what do you want to do?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.057
Okay, yeah,
you keep doing that

07:12.057 --> 07:14.017
and I will...

07:14.017 --> 07:18.063
[clears throat]
I'll be here watching you.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.066
[laser gunfire on tablet]

07:25.863 --> 07:27.781
Okay, that's the end of that.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.032
I'm not finished!

07:29.032 --> 07:30.409
I know, but your dad said

07:30.409 --> 07:32.286
that you cannot watch
this the whole time.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.538
- Please.
- Oh, come on, J.J.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.498
Don't you want to hang out
with just me?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.708
No.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.171
Okay, I get it.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.089
Don't tell your dad.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.177
[sighs]

07:48.177 --> 07:50.179
[J.J. laughs]

07:53.307 --> 07:54.683
Hey, J.J.,

07:54.683 --> 07:57.352
do you maybe want to get out
of here and do something fun?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.104
- Fun?
- Yeah.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.356
- Who else is coming?
- I'm fun.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.983
Come on, I promise.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.068
- No! No!
- Yes!

08:05.068 --> 08:08.071
Excuse me,
VIP coming through.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.072
Excuse me.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.991
[indistinct chatter]

08:10.991 --> 08:13.994
Excuse me.
Thank you.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.621
Hey, excuse me.

08:15.621 --> 08:18.749
- Girl, give me my popcorn.
- Fine.

08:18.749 --> 08:22.211
"An articulate masterpiece."

08:22.211 --> 08:25.505
Um, what exactly
is this movie about?

08:25.505 --> 08:30.010
I'm not quite sure,
but the critics say it's great.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.346
I mean, people are saying
that Carter Washington,

08:32.346 --> 08:33.513
the writer-director,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.807
is basically, like,
the next Barry Jenkins.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.310
"The next"?
That didn't last long enough.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.354
Girl, you know they
always running us out.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.856
Like there can be only one
Black person at a time.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.441
I trust Jamie's judgement.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.444
I mean, she only invests
in sure things.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.404
Me, obviously, and this.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.365
I mean, the film has only been
out for two seconds.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.409
and Carter is already casting
for his next film.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.954
Ooh, getting in that
could be huge.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.081
[chuckles] Girl,
that's why I brought you...

08:59.081 --> 09:01.750
to meet him and to charm him.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.128
Redundant, darling.
To meet me is to be charmed.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.506
- I mean, that's right.
- [Angie] Well, hold on.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.341
Honey, the snack
is right here.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.009
You sitting beside me, baby?

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
[Lucinda on screen]
I baked you this Bible cake,

09:13.470 --> 09:15.722
this cake of forgiveness.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.891
[Dale on screen] Forgiveness
is a lot like cake.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.309
Depending on how you cut it,

09:19.309 --> 09:21.645
everybody don't always
want a piece.

09:21.645 --> 09:25.691
- [laughing]
- [coughing]

09:25.691 --> 09:28.068
- It's okay.
- [continues laughing]

09:28.068 --> 09:30.070
She's choking on popcorn.
Sorry.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.072
Are you crying right now?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.491
[Lucinda] You have the eyes
of who sees...

09:34.491 --> 09:36.076
This shit is trash.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.619
- Shh, girl.
- Let's dip.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.288
We are in the middle
of a row.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.789
[Dale]
Men on the force do that.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.625
So then let's dip
from the middle of the row.

09:43.625 --> 09:47.254
Jamie is right behind us.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
[chuckles awkwardly]

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
Girl, you owe me.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.135
- Smile.
- Fine.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.137
Hi, we're here.
Yes.

09:55.137 --> 09:59.308
Send.
And girlfriend of the year.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.393
All right.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.687
Aren't we having
so much fun, J.J.?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.939
- We just got here.
- Yes.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.275
- Quinn, hey.
- Oh, gosh, you're still here.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.320
I saw your story, and it
looked like a lot of fun.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.030
Yeah, I like to come here
to blow off steam.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.072
Who's this?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.491
Oh, this is
my boyfriend's son, J.J.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.119
We're just two bros
hanging out,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.454
having a good time.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.831
Right, J.J.?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.333
Okay.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.335
I'm just really trying
to get him back to his father

10:26.335 --> 10:28.170
in one whole kid piece,

10:28.170 --> 10:29.921
and him telling his dad
that he likes me

10:29.921 --> 10:31.631
would not be a bad thing,
you get me?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.300
- Why don't you join me?
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.509
We don't want to intrude.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.219
I'm bowling alone.
How could you intrude?

10:36.219 --> 10:37.512
Bowling alone?

10:37.512 --> 10:39.473
That might be
the one sadder thing

10:39.473 --> 10:41.183
than trying to buy
a kid's affection.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.934
Yeah, well, all my friends
bailed early,

10:42.934 --> 10:45.771
so I thought I'd throw
a few more, and here you are.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.813
It's fate.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.732
Sad, sad fate.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.816
We'll do it.
Piggyback.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.401
- Uh-uh.
- Okay. Well, I can just...

10:51.401 --> 10:52.736
No.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.654
Fine. I will not touch you.
Do you want to granola bar?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.323
- No.
- Okay, fine.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.367
Let's just get a couple
of these nibbles and a swag bag

10:58.367 --> 10:59.826
and be up out of here.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.244
- Hi.
- [Tye] Hi.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.747
Did you love it,
or did you love it?

11:03.747 --> 11:04.956
[both laugh]

11:04.956 --> 11:07.709
Oh, Carter is definitely
one to watch.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.835
He's a visionary.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.462
And, you know,
this is my friend Angie,

11:10.462 --> 11:12.089
she's also one to watch.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.840
She just snatched her
a plum role

11:13.840 --> 11:16.176
in Get The Musical.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
Oh, that's gonna be
a big hit.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.971
Oh, yes, yes.

11:19.971 --> 11:23.517
We just had a very successful
invited dress rehearsal.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.434
Right, Tye?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.228
Mm-hmm.
I was there.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.605
Oh, that is
absolutely wonderful.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.315
Y-you have to meet Carter.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.067
Oh, yes.
You've got...Carter.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.527
- No, it's okay.
- Carter?

11:33.527 --> 11:34.986
Come here.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.281
This is Tye
and her good friend Angie,

11:38.281 --> 11:41.159
who is in
Get The Musical.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.662
- Headed to Broadway, huh?
- Yes.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.956
And Tye's app is one
of my best investments.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.374
Mm, Jamie knows
how to pick 'em.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.292
- Oh, she sure does.
- [laughter]

11:49.292 --> 11:50.961
I'm glad you were able
to come out.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.629
You know we got to support.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.047
Got to put on for the culture.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.799
- Yes, for the culture.
- That part.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.592
For the culture, yes.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.219
Mm-hmm.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.513
- Just one question...
- [clears throat]

12:01.513 --> 12:05.016
...why did the mother make
her son's murderer a cake?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.309
Angie.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.687
Oh, I love when my work
sparks conversation.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.856
Yeah, you tell her.
Tell her.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.358
I wanted to make a movie
that didn't end in tragedy.

12:13.358 --> 12:17.571
Rather than carry the weight
of anger and resentment,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.239
she's chooses forgiveness.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.282
Get it now?

12:20.282 --> 12:22.451
I-it's one of the things
I loved

12:22.451 --> 12:25.662
when Carter first brought me
the project, the levity.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.831
- [Tye] Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:27.831 --> 12:32.627
Yes. I just don't buy that
the mother forgives the cop,

12:32.627 --> 12:35.881
bakes him a Bible cake, and,
uh, falls in love with him.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.257
[clears throat]

12:37.257 --> 12:40.510
It can be difficult
for some people to comprehend.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.678
Pardon me?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.055
I'm not like your typical
Black filmmaker.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.308
I have an eclectic sensibility,

12:46.308 --> 12:49.769
and I've study the greats,
Kubrick and Dick Wolf.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.689
You ain't special just because
you watch "Law & Order."

12:52.689 --> 12:55.442
The shit is on all damn day.
You can't miss it.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.778
And to be clear,
I understood your film.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.489
I just think it's bad.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.492
You are literally the only
person I have encountered

13:03.492 --> 13:05.535
who doesn't love this film.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.120
Oh, taking care
of your Negro, huh?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.664
Well, congratulations
on being basic.

13:09.664 --> 13:13.084
And thank you for the tickets
and the little swag bag.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.503
Barry Jenkins, my ass.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.255
[Tye stammers,
chuckles awkwardly]

13:17.255 --> 13:20.926
- Cream puff, anyone?
- Uh, yeah.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.056
All right.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.934
Shall we paint the town red
like Billie Holiday?

13:28.934 --> 13:30.602
[chuckles]
I can't.

13:30.602 --> 13:34.981
Then we shall bring...
[speaks indistinctly]

13:34.981 --> 13:38.026
It's Camille,
and I'm fine.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.819
Look, don't be stubborn.
We'll take you home.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.404
I'm not being stubborn.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.740
I'm perfectly capable of
getting my own transportation.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.158
Shit.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.160
Look, we'll have you home
in ten minutes, promise.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.912
All right?
Come on.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.706
Okay, yes, but only
'cause I'm running late.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.709
[soft hip-hop music]

13:56.836 --> 14:00.090
Uh, first stop is 121st
and Morningside.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.591
Got it.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.552
Mr. Ice Bags, go ahead
and turn the heat on, man.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.136
[driver]
No heat.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.138
Are sure you're okay?

14:07.138 --> 14:08.640
I mean,
it seemed like we're okay.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.226
Yeah, totally okay.
[chuckles]

14:11.226 --> 14:12.561
Okay.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.358
I'm just worried that my text

14:18.358 --> 14:20.151
might've made
the night a little weird.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.112
What?
What text?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.573
No, your quiet voice
is making this weird.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.324
You know, 'cause I was talking
about us working together.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.325
You know what I'm saying?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.578
Like, was working together
a mistake?

14:29.578 --> 14:32.163
Right. Yeah, of course.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.249
No, no, no mistake.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.792
You know,
t-this was easy.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.878
We did it good...
together, doing that thing.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.716
- Whatever you say.
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:42.716 --> 14:45.885
It means I'm agreeing with you.
It's a good thing.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.472
Yeah, because, you know,
I just need to get home.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.434
I have to meet up
with Jameson.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.811
Hmm, the boyfriend.
[snickers]

14:56.813 --> 14:57.939
What?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.566
I know you want to say
some slick shit.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.192
I don't want to say
no slick shit

15:01.192 --> 15:04.613
about Slim Jim, bare chest,
chicken leg-looking ass.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.156
[chuckles]

15:06.156 --> 15:08.408
I'm just kidding.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.535
Look, I'm happy for you.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.912
Honestly.
I mean, you deserve love.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.587
Um, sir, I'm sorry,
you just passed my street,

15:20.587 --> 15:25.008
but it's okay 'cause you can
just let me hop out right here.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.426
Hello?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
Yo, shut the fuck up.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.721
Bro, don't talk to her
like that.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.222
Yo, who are you?
Her attorney?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.308
You deserve love.
Shut up, Dr. Phil.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.310
Fat-ass Craig Robinson got
some jokes up there, huh?

15:35.310 --> 15:37.062
Nigga, you lucky
I'm with my girl,

15:37.062 --> 15:38.021
otherwise I'd handle...

15:38.021 --> 15:39.230
I didn't mean it
like that, boo.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.441
Fuck, I just did this
in an Uber.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.276
Are you sure we got
in the right car?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.778
[Ian]
Louis, this is your car, right?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.363
[Camille]
Something's wrong.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.614
Hey, just go ahead
and pull over,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.032
and we'll...we'll go on
about our business...

15:49.032 --> 15:50.367
- Oh!
- Hey! Whoa!

15:50.367 --> 15:52.077
Say one more thing,
I'm gonna light your ass up

15:52.077 --> 15:53.662
- like Times Square.
- I was just kidding

15:53.662 --> 15:55.163
about that
Craig Robinson thing, dog.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.581
- [driver] Oh, no, no.
- I...I didn't mean it..

15:56.581 --> 15:58.416
- [driver] That hurt.
- Get off me.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.210
[driver]
Oh, shit! You got a phone.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.254
Everybody's got a phone.
Come on, hand 'em over.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.382
- All right, man, just chill.
- Here, here, here.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.800
- His too.
- [Camille] Yeah, yeah.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.927
If you look at the photos,
don't judge.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.136
Samsung?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.554
You make more money
than that, man.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.348
And don't do nothing
stupid either,

16:13.348 --> 16:14.849
'cause y'all look stupid.

16:14.849 --> 16:17.394
Fucking stupid, stupider,
and stupidest.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.693
All right, lets bowl.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.611
Let me do this!

16:26.611 --> 16:29.739
- God, he hates me.
- [laughs]

16:29.739 --> 16:31.074
You're crazy.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.076
I grew up
with four little brothers.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.078
Boys just want to do it
all themselves.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.664
- Dumb boys.
- Who you telling?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.873
Bad luck with men, too?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.291
Huh?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.919
Oh, I assumed you knew.
I'm gay.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.089
Oh.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.508
Cool.
[chuckles awkwardly]

16:48.508 --> 16:50.093
Good job, J.J.!

16:50.093 --> 16:51.344
Can I get another chance?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.471
Yeah, of course,
you get two chances, bud.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.140
You just got to wait
for the ball to come back.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.725
- Our food is here.
- [Quinn] Okay.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.727
All right.
See you in a bit.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.937
- Okay.
- I'm watching.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.526
Oh, God,
he's so bad at bowling.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.319
[chuckles]

17:08.319 --> 17:09.821
I hope I didn't
freak you out.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.741
What?
Why would that freak me out?

17:12.741 --> 17:15.368
No, please,
one of my best friends is gay.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.578
[laughs]

17:16.578 --> 17:18.621
Oh, my God,
did I literally just say that?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.790
- You're fine.
- Sorry.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.001
You know your mom tried
to set me up with someone?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.419
What?

17:24.419 --> 17:26.171
A 56-year old art therapist

17:26.171 --> 17:28.840
and I'm guessing, like,
the only lesbian she knows.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.134
- My aunt Peg.
- [laughs]

17:31.134 --> 17:33.386
She set you up
with my aunt Peg.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.221
Oh, my God.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.976
Gay or straight, my mom is
absolutely horrible at fix-ups.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.561
The last guy that she set me up
with,

17:41.561 --> 17:44.147
she swore he was gonna be
my husband.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.774
Asked me for money
on the first date.

17:45.774 --> 17:46.733
No, he didn't.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.318
She's terrible,
I'm telling you.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.153
You think it'd be easier
for two attractive women

17:50.153 --> 17:52.071
who have their shit together
to find partners.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.158
Amen.
[sighs]

17:55.158 --> 17:56.785
But, I mean, look at you.
You must...

17:56.785 --> 17:58.369
you must get dates
all the time.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.538
Confession time?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.917
This was supposed to be a date,
but she stood me up.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.460
The only reason
I posted that story

18:05.460 --> 18:06.753
was because I think she forgot,

18:06.753 --> 18:08.963
and if she saw it,
it would remind her.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.799
Oh, no! Why didn't you
just call her?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.175
I did...

18:12.175 --> 18:14.177
- like, six times.
- [scoffs]

18:14.177 --> 18:16.387
- And I texted her.
- Oh.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.223
- Yeah. I'm a loser.
- Sorry.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.600
No.
Oh, no, you are not.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.394
That's the last thing you are.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.104
It's her loss.

18:26.481 --> 18:29.442
Can I please have
another soda?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
Yeah.
I'll get you another one.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.612
You stay there,
and I'll get it, okay?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.073
Two sodas,
he's got to love me.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.617
Of course.
You're freakin' lovable.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.620
[upbeat hip-hop music]

18:43.206 --> 18:46.125
All you had to do
was say something nice,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.086
but you just couldn't
help yourself, could you?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.754
I asked a simple question.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
You bashed
a Black filmmaker...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.341
I didn't bash him.
You overexaggerating.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.051
...in front of his
very white producer.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.886
You know how hard it is
for Black people

18:56.886 --> 18:58.096
to get something made?

18:58.096 --> 19:01.057
And then to have
an investor believe in you

19:01.057 --> 19:02.517
and want to help you,

19:02.517 --> 19:04.185
when the whole world
don't want to see you succeed.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.146
- I was just keeping it real.
- Oh-ho-ho.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.357
You're gonna be keeping it
real unemployed.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.692
That's what you gonna do.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.861
You want to curse out
every gatekeeper

19:12.861 --> 19:14.904
in the name
of "keeping it real," for what?

19:14.904 --> 19:17.323
You want to win,
you play the game.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.658
That's what I was trying to do

19:18.658 --> 19:20.410
before you came
and fucked my shit up.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.828
Okay, if playing the game
means I have

19:21.828 --> 19:24.747
to stand problematic art,
then count me out.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.207
We need to tell the truth.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.335
- Oh, the truth?
- Yes.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.839
Black art deserves criticized
just like every other art form.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.549
That's how we get better.

19:34.549 --> 19:37.719
Oh, okay,
Miss That's How We Get Better.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.805
You want criticism?
Here you go.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.683
Get The Musical was bad.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.144
It was horrific.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.478
But y'all said...

19:47.478 --> 19:50.189
Oh, we were not trying
to hurt your feelings.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.399
That's what friends do.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.569
Lying to me does not make me
look better.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.321
It makes me look stupid!

19:56.321 --> 19:58.615
I knew I shouldn't have did
this shit!

19:58.615 --> 20:02.327
See, some things are
just better left unsaid.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.121
Like you kept a whole husband
to yourself?

20:05.121 --> 20:07.290
Since we're giving out
constructive criticism,

20:07.290 --> 20:08.625
just a note...

20:08.625 --> 20:11.711
not my marriage,
but some random dude pops up,

20:11.711 --> 20:13.296
cosigns a surgery,

20:13.296 --> 20:16.090
and then just disappears like
some sort of magical Negro.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.717
What the fuck was that?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.302
Okay.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.847
Low blow,
but I get it.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.683
It was a long time ago,
I'm a different Tye now.

20:25.683 --> 20:29.270
It seems like there's a bunch
of different Tyes.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.105
We've been hanging out
with you since college,

20:31.105 --> 20:34.525
and there's still so much
about you we do not know.

20:34.525 --> 20:38.029
Look, I'm sorry.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.531
The divorce papers
are signed.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.201
Brandon is gone. I'm closing
that chapter of my life.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.745
And I promise,
from here on out,

20:45.745 --> 20:48.456
no more secrets.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.083
So how many men
have you slept with?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.334
Angie, none.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.127
Bitch, just give me a ballpark.
You lying.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.588
Should we go back
to your place, get some food?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.423
No, I'm wiped out.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.176
I'm just gonna go home
and go to bed.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.179
[bowling pins clatter]

21:03.179 --> 21:05.890
Hey! Good job!
Well done!

21:17.902 --> 21:19.320
[both] Oh!

21:26.953 --> 21:29.622
[laughs] Oh, my God.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.582
We actually got it.
[chuckles]

21:35.294 --> 21:36.546
[J.J.]
Yuck!

21:36.546 --> 21:41.384
Oh, J.J., um,
look what we got for you.

21:41.384 --> 21:44.804
[soulful hip-hop music]

21:44.804 --> 21:46.556
[driver]
Get down the stairs.

21:46.556 --> 21:49.809
- [Camille] Where are we?
- [Ian] Shit, I don't know.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.312
So you think this is
about drugs or sex trafficking?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.732
Oh, my God, sex trafficking
is my worst nightmare.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.025
Okay, something tells me

21:57.025 --> 21:58.651
you don't have to worry
about that so much.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.902
That's sexist, Camille.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.321
Man, shut the fuck up
and keep walking.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.532
And don't nobody want to
have sex with you anyway.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.119
- I think you're very sexable.
- Man, shut up!

22:08.119 --> 22:10.079
- I think you are sexable, too.
- Aw, thanks.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.581
I bought a Peloton.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.083
- [Camille] Did we time-travel?
- [driver] Get your ass...

22:14.083 --> 22:16.419
[Louis]
Ooh, I can use a nice cocktail.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.047
- [Ian] Louis, Louis.
- [Camille shouts indistinctly]

22:19.047 --> 22:21.049
Go upstairs, go upstairs.

22:21.049 --> 22:24.052
[Camille] So...so this is
a long-distance robbery.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.636
He could've just robbed us
back in Harlem.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.555
I'm guessing he wanted
to avoid the cameras.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.015
Get your ass in there.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.142
All right,
clear out the accounts.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.310
What? I-I can't.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.062
- What?
- I mean, in this day and age,

22:34.062 --> 22:36.064
it doesn't really work
like that because of situations

22:36.064 --> 22:37.482
like the one
we're literally in right now.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.233
Yeah, I mean, you can only
get out, like, $500 a time.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.693
I mean, I can't even
get that much right now

22:40.693 --> 22:42.236
'cause the way
my account is set up.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.863
You know, I got one of them...
them RushCards, so...

22:43.863 --> 22:45.031
You got RushCard?

22:45.031 --> 22:47.158
It was a free trial.
I couldn't pass it up.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.452
Okay, how much
can I get from you right now?

22:49.452 --> 22:52.330
Um, maybe, like, 350 each?

22:52.330 --> 22:54.332
350?
I got, like, 200.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.292
[sighs] Get it.
Get your 200 out.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.585
- You stand right there.
- [Camille] Yep.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.087
- There you go.
- Standing.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.505
What are doing
with this clown?

23:00.505 --> 23:01.964
- Uh...
- [ATM beeps]

23:01.964 --> 23:03.257
You look good tonight.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.593
- I mean, your skin is amazing.
- Thank you.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.136
Give me that.
All right, stand back.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.304
Stand over here.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.639
Go ahead, princess.
It's your turn, beautiful.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.099
Take your money out.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.809
Feeling like big man with
that gun in your hand, huh?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.435
Yeah, thanks for noticing.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.688
All right, get in...
No, go that way, mother...

23:17.688 --> 23:19.482
Get in there.
Get your ass in there, boy.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.400
You got your money.
Now please let us go.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.528
What, so you can call
the cops?

23:23.528 --> 23:26.906
That's not how
this night's gonna end.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.700
[Camille]
We have to get out of here.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.538
Shit, it's sealed shut.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.665
- Shit.
- Try to hop through the vent.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.042
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.919
Step up.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.338
Okay, you know what? This
isn't Mission Impossible, okay?

23:42.338 --> 23:44.757
And we both know my ass is not
gonna fit in that small hole.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.467
This is what happens
when you lie.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.677
These are the consequences...

23:47.677 --> 23:49.178
death in the middle
of nowhere

23:49.178 --> 23:51.097
in a Prohibition-era brothel.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.766
What you mean, lie?
What are you talking about?

23:53.766 --> 23:57.645
I lied to Jameson
about meeting up with you.

23:59.522 --> 24:03.151
Well, I didn't tell Mira
about us...

24:03.151 --> 24:05.695
meeting today either.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.113
Why?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.739
[sighs]
I don't know.

24:08.739 --> 24:11.075
It just seemed like it was
difficult to explain, you know.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.416
Ian, are we gonna die?

24:18.416 --> 24:20.001
[sighs]

24:20.001 --> 24:23.754
If Dateline has taught me
anything...

24:23.754 --> 24:24.964
yeah.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.760
So this is it.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.555
This is how
Miss Doctor Camille Parks

24:32.555 --> 24:34.223
leaves this earth.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.644
I always thought
that I would be surrounded

24:38.644 --> 24:42.356
by friends and family...

24:42.356 --> 24:44.192
Prince playing
in the background.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.443
[chuckles]

24:45.443 --> 24:47.486
You know,
you always liked Prince.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.197
Yeah.

24:49.197 --> 24:52.575
[chuckles]

24:52.575 --> 24:54.368
You never answered my text.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.787
How could you never
answer my text?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.623
Your work text?

24:58.623 --> 25:00.541
[clicks tongue]
You know it wasn't about work.

25:00.541 --> 25:05.379
I just want things to be
less awkward between us...

25:05.379 --> 25:07.798
you know, like we used to be.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.802
It's like a...
[sighs]

25:11.802 --> 25:14.013
...it's like a soufflé
that fell a little bit,

25:14.013 --> 25:17.600
and every time I try to fix it,
I just...

25:17.600 --> 25:18.768
fuck it up.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.064
Yeah.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.566
Camille, I still love you.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.610
I never stopped.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.452
[door bangs open]

25:36.452 --> 25:38.246
- [Camille] Oh, my God!
- Come here, come here.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.122
I got you.
I got you.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.165
Oh, there you are.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.667
- [Ian sighs]
- [Camille] Oh!

25:42.667 --> 25:44.627
I've missed you guys.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.128
What happened?

25:46.128 --> 25:48.464
Oh, he took all the money from
my cards, and then he left.

25:48.464 --> 25:52.802
But, luckily, he underestimated
the value of the vulva.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.638
Let's get the hell
out of here.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.890
Yeah, yeah.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.986
Hey.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.362
Hey.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.491
What happened?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.076
Ah...

26:17.076 --> 26:19.870
dinner with Angie
turned into drinks.

26:19.870 --> 26:23.749
Drinks turned to more drinks,
and there was a lot of drinks.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.544
I'm sorry I didn't call,
I left my phone in the Uber.

26:26.544 --> 26:29.213
Is Angie good?

26:29.213 --> 26:33.467
'Cause I know you're not good
unless your friends are good.

26:33.467 --> 26:36.637
Yeah.
I mean, you know, she's...

26:36.637 --> 26:38.514
figuring it out.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.183
You know?

26:41.183 --> 26:42.476
Sometimes it hard to tell

26:42.476 --> 26:44.228
if you're making
the right decision.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.897
Well, she should trust
her gut.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.525
It'll never steer you wrong.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.901
[Camille]
There are two ways

26:50.901 --> 26:54.113
to be unburdened
by the weight of a secret.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.704
[Camille] You can make
the choice to disclose it...

27:10.129 --> 27:13.132
[Camille] ...or you can wait
until it exposes itself.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.179
Yo, Brandon,
how you doing?

27:18.179 --> 27:19.638
I'm awesome.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.433
Great. And did you get a chance
to sign those divorce papers?

27:22.433 --> 27:26.187
- No, not yet.
- Is that my table from the...

27:26.187 --> 27:27.563
Oh yeah.
Mm-hmm.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.359
Just trying to make
your guest room feel like home.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.110
[chuckles]

27:33.110 --> 27:36.030
It has been
a really long night.

27:38.032 --> 27:41.744
Either way, the truth
will set you free...

27:41.744 --> 27:43.162
right?
