WEBVTT

00:27.295 --> 00:28.696
Has she said anything?

00:28.731 --> 00:30.797
No. Nothing since we found her.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.866
How did she get back here?

00:33.901 --> 00:36.275
Security log says she used a
code.

00:36.310 --> 00:38.805
But how she got one, I have no
clue.

00:39.643 --> 00:42.743
She must have gotten it
from one of the staff. Who?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.614
I don't know.

00:45.649 --> 00:47.319
That's your job.

00:52.590 --> 00:53.655
Do you think...

00:53.690 --> 00:56.262
He has anything to do with it?

00:56.297 --> 00:58.462
That's what I need to find out.

01:05.207 --> 01:07.207
Gonzalez, we gotta go!

01:14.414 --> 01:16.711
So what's your plan?

01:18.517 --> 01:21.155
To ask some questions.

01:21.190 --> 01:22.783
Make sure your team is recording
this.

01:22.818 --> 01:25.192
We need to review and debrief
for any other potential
incidents.

01:26.228 --> 01:27.293
Yes, ma'am.

01:42.871 --> 01:43.870
She's stirring.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.608
Well, give her another dose.

01:47.711 --> 01:48.809
Pull this up in full.

01:48.844 --> 01:50.349
I want to see this.

03:42.826 --> 03:44.529
Sophia.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.532
How did you get back here?

05:31.506 --> 05:32.505
Oh my god...

06:35.702 --> 06:37.735
You shouldn't be out of bed.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.132
Where am I?

06:39.167 --> 06:41.508
You're-

06:50.684 --> 06:52.046
Guard.

06:54.655 --> 06:56.050
Take a seat.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.596
Who is he?

07:08.768 --> 07:10.933
Gonzalez. Good.

07:14.169 --> 07:15.542
What happened?

07:15.577 --> 07:17.973
You were in surgery for 3 hours.

07:18.008 --> 07:21.944
We had to amputate portions
of your arm, otherwise, you
would have bled to death.

07:29.591 --> 07:31.255
Are you finished?

07:35.124 --> 07:37.025
I need to check your arm.

07:42.934 --> 07:44.505
Please.

07:47.807 --> 07:48.608
Mmm...

07:53.274 --> 07:56.781
Hmmm...A little rushed.
But all things considered.

07:58.246 --> 08:00.213
The damage is stable.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.721
How long have I been out?

08:02.756 --> 08:03.855
What happened?

08:03.891 --> 08:06.527
What happened?!
Someone will come by in the
morning.

08:07.057 --> 08:10.058
Wait, wait.

08:10.258 --> 08:11.763
Wait.

09:00.979 --> 09:01.578
Hello?

09:05.247 --> 09:07.687
Good morning, Miss Gonzalez.

09:08.184 --> 09:11.284
I know it's been rough.
But you're safe now.

09:12.023 --> 09:14.628
This is a secured facility.

09:14.663 --> 09:15.728
Your home.

09:22.869 --> 09:24.770
They took him last night. What
happened?

09:25.707 --> 09:27.036
Yes, Mr. Callahan.

09:27.302 --> 09:28.202
He transferred out.

09:28.710 --> 09:30.809
Full recovery, I'm told.

09:31.009 --> 09:34.175
That didn't look like recovery
to me.

09:34.210 --> 09:39.180
Well, not going to lie.
For some coming back from the
field, recovery is a relative
term.

09:40.216 --> 09:44.152
Now. Do you need help changing?

09:48.763 --> 09:51.731
No.

09:54.868 --> 09:55.801
Sorry.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.672
You remind me of my brother.

09:58.707 --> 09:59.937
Is he a soldier?

09:59.972 --> 10:02.368
Yes, he was.

10:02.403 --> 10:04.073
I'm sorry.

10:04.273 --> 10:05.910
That's why I'm here now.

10:05.945 --> 10:09.914
Doing what I do. To help where I
can.

10:09.949 --> 10:12.917
Once you get settled
in, I think you'll like this
place.

10:13.821 --> 10:17.317
You're here to relax and
recover. You all have earned it.

10:17.352 --> 10:20.452
A "thank you" for your service.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.828
I'm not exactly looking to
retire.

10:22.863 --> 10:25.699
Oh, no. We're much more than
that.

10:25.899 --> 10:28.229
The "Harmony" program
is to help you with the next
step.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.297
Whatever that is.

10:30.904 --> 10:31.837
Are you civilian?

10:35.777 --> 10:38.976
You just got to follow your care
plan.

10:40.045 --> 10:45.411
Well, this is patient avenue.
Down at the end on the left are
the labs.

10:45.446 --> 10:47.952
Through these double doors is
the common room.

10:47.987 --> 10:50.086
Three hot meals a day, all
served in there.

10:50.121 --> 10:52.385
And up a little further
on the right is the gym.

10:53.454 --> 10:55.993
Now, let's go see your room.

11:28.962 --> 11:29.994
Cozy.

11:30.997 --> 11:34.394
Only the essentials. Everything
else is clutter.

11:35.001 --> 11:37.364
Well, I'll let you get settled.
In.

11:37.399 --> 11:40.466
I believe first thing is
reporting
to the lab for some standard
tests.

11:42.470 --> 11:45.042
Oh! One last thing before I go.

11:45.847 --> 11:50.146
I need to see you take these.
There for the pain.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.117
Nothing hurts.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.350
You can thank the anesthesia for
that.

11:56.385 --> 11:59.089
Believe me, it's going to hurt.
Big time.

12:11.466 --> 12:14.907
Great. I'll see you tomorrow for
a checkup.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.402
When did you and Erik first
meet?

12:48.437 --> 12:51.075
What? You don't have that
recorded?

13:11.328 --> 13:14.065
I'm assuming breakfast hasn't
started yet.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.165
Mine has.

13:21.503 --> 13:23.635
I quit just before deployment.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.241
That's impressive.

13:25.276 --> 13:26.979
Actually, it's pretty fucking
stupid.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.015
Oh, so I'm enabling.

13:32.184 --> 13:34.019
I won't tell anyone.

13:34.318 --> 13:35.284
Where were you stationed?

13:36.353 --> 13:38.650
The Eastern section.

13:38.685 --> 13:43.457
It was supposed to be a security
detail,
but it ended up being actual
combat.

13:43.998 --> 13:44.997
How about you?

13:45.626 --> 13:47.395
Field intelligence.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.902
Where?

13:48.937 --> 13:52.972
All over. Kansas. West Virginia.

13:53.007 --> 13:55.370
Even at a few weeks in western
Nevada.

13:56.175 --> 13:58.637
Damn. And you made it out?

13:58.672 --> 14:04.643
Mostly. Got a little too close
to an IED and landed myself
here.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.953
How long have you been here?

14:06.988 --> 14:11.056
It's hard to say. You know,
everything's so sterile.
All looks the same.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.554
It's been a while though.

14:16.195 --> 14:17.491
How'd that happen?

14:18.197 --> 14:20.527
Would you believe I clapped too
hard.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.500
No. Just a casualty of war.

14:28.042 --> 14:30.207
I was one of the lucky ones.

14:30.506 --> 14:32.275
That makes two of us.

14:34.378 --> 14:37.346
Well, I guess I'm quitting too.
Last cartridge.

14:38.019 --> 14:40.448
And you let me use it all up?

14:40.483 --> 14:43.088
Sophia Gonzalez to radiology.

14:43.123 --> 14:45.354
Sophia Gonzalez to radiology
please.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.193
Are you Sophia Gonzalez?

14:49.228 --> 14:50.931
That would be me.

14:52.264 --> 14:54.693
What do they call you over the
speakers?

14:54.728 --> 14:57.729
Erik.

14:57.764 --> 15:01.238
Thanks for the smoke, Eric.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.571
I owe you one.

15:04.606 --> 15:06.210
I like menthols.

18:01.486 --> 18:03.420
So what are these ones now?

18:34.354 --> 18:35.815
The fuck is this?

18:47.829 --> 18:52.238
Okay, now that that is
concluded,
can we get some initial
reactions?

18:52.273 --> 18:53.635
Reaction?

18:54.506 --> 18:55.769
To what?

18:56.772 --> 18:59.344
It's just random color and
sounds.

18:59.940 --> 19:06.780
Interesting. Okay, anything
else?

19:09.686 --> 19:11.653
I don't get it either.

19:13.822 --> 19:15.591
Thank God.

19:16.462 --> 19:19.595
I feel like I'm going nuts, the
longer I watch this shit.

19:22.831 --> 19:23.698
How long have you been here?

19:25.504 --> 19:29.935
Three weeks. You?

19:29.970 --> 19:32.410
Just a couple of days.

19:33.347 --> 19:35.545
Do they do this kind of thing a
lot?

19:37.780 --> 19:38.548
Yeah.

19:40.084 --> 19:45.423
Seems like every day they come
up with some new mental test
or colored pill.

19:45.656 --> 19:47.656
Sometimes both at the same time.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.233
Do you know when you'll be
released?

19:54.665 --> 19:55.994
No clue.

19:57.866 --> 19:59.767
Not in any rush though.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.275
You don't want to get out of
here?

20:02.508 --> 20:04.937
It beats deployment.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.941
Beds are clean. Foods warm.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.319
Closest thing to a vacation
I've ever had.

20:16.687 --> 20:17.752
Do you trust them?

20:21.725 --> 20:24.924
You ask a lot of questions.

20:25.729 --> 20:27.564
Call it "recon".

20:29.337 --> 20:31.733
Seems like they're helping us.

20:31.768 --> 20:35.473
It's hard to trust anyone
anymore. Y'know?

20:38.445 --> 20:40.907
I'm here for a reason.

20:40.942 --> 20:44.515
When they tell me to go, I'll
go.

20:48.653 --> 20:51.522
There's a lot they're not
telling us.

20:53.559 --> 20:57.528
Well, when you figure that out,
you let me know.

20:59.730 --> 21:00.960
Charles.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.602
Sophia.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.047
Where were you deployed?

21:23.622 --> 21:25.391
I wasn't in the field.

21:25.789 --> 21:28.427
I was part of command team out
of New York.

21:28.462 --> 21:29.758
You were on the ground?

21:29.793 --> 21:30.858
Yes, sir.

21:31.058 --> 21:32.090
Just on the other side of the
river.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.091
Hey hey!

21:38.472 --> 21:40.373
Old habits? Sorry.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.003
Hey, what happened in New York?

21:48.845 --> 21:50.977
Could have gone worse.

21:51.012 --> 21:55.421
Command structure collapsed
after the bombings
and we were forced out.

21:55.852 --> 21:58.116
Me and my troops were airlifted
at the last second.

22:00.120 --> 22:04.529
Two dozen soldiers. Out of 300.

22:11.505 --> 22:12.438
You were hurt?

22:14.541 --> 22:16.772
No, I wasn't hurt.

22:17.874 --> 22:20.545
Higher ups said I was suffering
"traumatic stress".

22:21.812 --> 22:23.713
But I know my own head.

22:25.750 --> 22:29.719
It's not hallucinations or
trauma or...

22:30.920 --> 22:31.754
whatever.

22:32.823 --> 22:36.088
Nothing can have prepared
you for what happened.

22:36.695 --> 22:38.464
How'd you make it out?

22:40.534 --> 22:42.127
I knew the area.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.636
You have friends there?

22:47.607 --> 22:49.475
Family?

22:50.709 --> 22:53.611
I lived there before the war.

22:53.910 --> 22:56.207
I knew a lot of people that went

22:56.242 --> 22:57.780
both ways.

22:58.717 --> 23:02.048
Hey, they're Americans just like
us.

23:02.083 --> 23:05.084
We all have to remember that
when this is over.

23:05.119 --> 23:08.560
I hope we still have a country
to put back together.

23:12.159 --> 23:15.193
At least the first time, It was
the North verses South, y'know.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.097
Now it's...

23:18.638 --> 23:20.506
neighbor versus neighbor.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.477
No battle lines, no territory.

23:25.073 --> 23:27.612
Just one big fucking mess.

23:46.765 --> 23:49.469
These are the amazing meals?

23:51.803 --> 23:56.476
Said it was "hot". Not "good".

25:12.246 --> 25:14.048
Can you feel that?

25:15.887 --> 25:16.919
Does it hurt?

25:16.954 --> 25:17.887
No.

25:17.922 --> 25:18.822
Shit!

25:18.857 --> 25:19.790
Sorry.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.995
It does look like you have a
mild rash.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.162
Have you been taking those
pills?

25:29.197 --> 25:30.328
Everything you gave me.

25:35.775 --> 25:37.170
I thought you said it was for
the pain.

25:37.205 --> 25:39.271
Yeah. It is.

25:39.306 --> 25:41.878
But it's good with all kinds of
stuff.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.111
How long is my treatment?

25:44.146 --> 25:47.246
Ummm. Can't say for sure.

25:47.754 --> 25:51.085
Could be a couple of weeks.
Could be longer.

25:51.758 --> 25:56.728
Anyway. You need Dr. Ranson to
clear you
before you go back to fighting
bad guys.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.796
That's the woman who checked me
in?

25:58.831 --> 26:01.931
Yes. Dr. Ranson's head of the
administration here.

26:10.238 --> 26:14.680
Are there any side effects?

26:14.880 --> 26:18.079
What do you mean? Did something
happen?

26:19.819 --> 26:23.018
No. I was just not sleeping
well.

26:23.988 --> 26:26.120
Some crazy dreams.

26:26.386 --> 26:28.155
Just a moment.

26:29.455 --> 26:34.029
Sophia, I'm going to order some
tests
with a psychiatrist.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.999
Tell him everything, okay?

26:37.034 --> 26:39.397
It's very important that you do
that. Okay?

26:41.841 --> 26:43.038
Sure.

26:49.310 --> 26:50.947
Sophia.

26:59.353 --> 27:00.858
Sophia.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.480
How have you been sleeping?

27:29.515 --> 27:32.285
Compared to a war zone? Pretty
amazing. You?

27:33.486 --> 27:35.695
Barely at all.

27:36.830 --> 27:39.732
Something about this place,
like...

27:41.362 --> 27:45.331
Do you ever have, like, vivid
dreams?

27:46.004 --> 27:48.169
I guess so. Yeah.

27:48.204 --> 27:51.040
I think that's pretty normal
for a soldier, though.

27:51.075 --> 27:56.243
No I mean, like, really strong,
real dreams.

27:56.278 --> 28:02.018
I mean dreams that feel so real,
like
they actually happened. Even
when it's over.

28:05.518 --> 28:08.893
I get the feeling this isn't
hypothetical.

28:11.227 --> 28:14.063
I must be having trouble
adjusting.

28:14.428 --> 28:16.362
Sophia.

28:18.069 --> 28:19.431
You can tell me.

28:25.472 --> 28:27.505
You know that door
at the end of the main hall.

28:27.980 --> 28:30.343
That leads to the administration
area?

28:32.149 --> 28:35.920
I had a dream that something
bad happened behind it.

28:35.955 --> 28:37.955
There was a man screaming.

28:37.990 --> 28:40.991
There was blood all over his
face.

28:41.026 --> 28:42.091
Do you know who it was?

28:42.126 --> 28:44.995
He was here when I first came.

28:45.030 --> 28:49.461
He was covered in bandages
and...awful.

28:49.496 --> 28:54.433
Then the next day they said he
transferred out.
Said he had a miraculous
recovery.

28:55.106 --> 28:56.776
You think they're lying?

28:57.977 --> 29:00.175
I don't know what I think...

29:00.210 --> 29:02.947
That's pretty serious, Sophia.

29:05.116 --> 29:07.050
You're right.

29:07.448 --> 29:10.053
We shouldn't be talking about
this.

29:10.891 --> 29:11.857
Where are you going?

29:13.124 --> 29:15.256
Got a psych evaluation.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.291
Besides.

29:19.031 --> 29:20.459
Check mate.

29:30.306 --> 29:33.472
So my parents are back home.

29:35.113 --> 29:36.508
Way behind the line.

29:41.218 --> 29:43.086
Either of them serve?

29:44.925 --> 29:47.552
Yeah, my dad did.

29:49.226 --> 29:52.392
But he retired before all this.

29:53.065 --> 29:56.231
Did he pressure you into
joining?

29:58.202 --> 30:02.237
I mean, he wanted me to join...

30:03.471 --> 30:07.440
And I wouldn't have if I didn't
want to. And...

30:09.015 --> 30:11.147
I don't-I don't want to talk
about this.

30:12.513 --> 30:15.855
Okay, but I feel like we're
really
getting somewhere here.

30:16.682 --> 30:17.615
You wanted to make-

30:17.650 --> 30:18.517
You don't care.

30:18.552 --> 30:19.991
You don't care.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.554
Of course I care, that's why I'm
here.

30:22.589 --> 30:24.391
They were really proud of me.

30:25.229 --> 30:26.657
Especially my dad.

30:26.692 --> 30:29.066
Because I followed him into the
service.

30:30.432 --> 30:32.432
And I know that meant something
to him.

30:32.467 --> 30:35.974
Why do you think your dad's
opinion
is so important.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.635
As opposed to your mom?

30:37.670 --> 30:39.010
No!

30:39.045 --> 30:39.945
Always has been.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.243
No, please!
SHUT UP!

30:41.278 --> 30:43.949
There are a lot of things I did,
but...

30:44.710 --> 30:47.282
I know that I made my dad proud.

30:53.620 --> 30:56.126
I know that I made them proud.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.546
Oh...

32:05.527 --> 32:07.626
And How often do you see this
vision of the old man?

32:09.168 --> 32:11.234
Barely anymore.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.336
But it's not about seeing him.

32:16.241 --> 32:18.175
You feel him.

32:19.277 --> 32:20.705
Everywhere.

32:22.247 --> 32:23.543
Always.

32:24.051 --> 32:25.644
In these dreams...

32:25.679 --> 32:27.712
how long before Eric
started appearing to you?

32:28.781 --> 32:30.154
Not long.

32:31.652 --> 32:34.323
I think with him being here
longer,

32:34.358 --> 32:37.095
he may have known what was
happening to me
before I did.

32:37.526 --> 32:39.999
You mean being on the drug
regimen?

32:41.233 --> 32:42.265
Right.

32:43.697 --> 32:44.663
Three,

32:45.303 --> 32:46.665
two,

32:46.700 --> 32:49.239
one.

32:53.806 --> 32:56.345
Ready or not, here I come.

33:42.393 --> 33:43.458
It's you.

33:49.730 --> 33:50.498
What are you doing here?

33:50.863 --> 33:52.599
Is this place yours?

33:54.141 --> 33:55.635
Yes. It's...

33:55.670 --> 33:57.538
my mother's but...

34:03.150 --> 34:05.777
I remember being so tired in
this house.

34:07.616 --> 34:09.814
I'd just stare out for hours

34:09.849 --> 34:12.850
waiting for something to happen.

34:12.885 --> 34:16.260
That my life would just
magically change.

34:16.295 --> 34:18.328
Did it?

34:18.363 --> 34:19.626
Yes, when I left.

34:21.333 --> 34:24.763
Now all I want is to be back
here.

34:25.799 --> 34:27.403
God, why did I leave?

34:41.650 --> 34:42.814
It's not right.

34:44.422 --> 34:46.356
Wanting to be back?

34:46.820 --> 34:51.823
No. This place, it's not...

34:52.760 --> 34:54.628
It's not right.

34:56.698 --> 34:58.797
That's not supposed to be there.

34:58.832 --> 35:00.832
That's not mine.

35:01.373 --> 35:02.735
And the mountains...

35:04.376 --> 35:06.805
There weren't any mountains.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.708
Where is this place?

35:08.743 --> 35:09.709
- What's happening?
- This is home...

35:09.744 --> 35:11.546
No, no, this is not the place.

35:11.581 --> 35:12.778
I don't recognize this place.

35:12.813 --> 35:13.680
Are you okay?

35:13.715 --> 35:14.879
No! What's happening?

35:15.486 --> 35:16.650
What is this place? What's going
on?

35:16.685 --> 35:17.948
I don't understand what's going
on!

36:00.828 --> 36:01.695
Hey.

36:02.896 --> 36:03.862
You busy?

36:04.865 --> 36:05.897
Yeah.

36:06.933 --> 36:08.801
I'm just counting tiles on the
ceiling again.

36:09.441 --> 36:11.705
Oh, oh, it's riveting stuff.

36:14.941 --> 36:16.479
Charles, I, uh...

36:16.514 --> 36:18.910
I wanted to ask you a couple
questions,

36:18.945 --> 36:20.978
but I got to warn you.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.518
It may sound a little weird.

36:22.553 --> 36:24.982
Look, I've already heard about
the good word.

36:26.623 --> 36:28.458
Religions just not for me.

36:28.493 --> 36:28.953
Charles...

36:30.594 --> 36:32.297
Have you felt

36:32.332 --> 36:34.596
anything weird since being here?

36:34.631 --> 36:37.335
Like having vivid dreams and...

36:41.033 --> 36:42.538
other people's thoughts?

36:48.007 --> 36:49.347
The hell you trying to say?

36:49.382 --> 36:50.513
I know

36:50.779 --> 36:53.780
it sounds crazy, and it's scary.

36:54.849 --> 36:56.684
But if you experienced anything-

36:56.719 --> 36:59.423
Look, I don't know what you're
doing,

36:59.458 --> 37:01.656
but I have not had any of that.

37:01.691 --> 37:02.591
Charles, I think you have.-

37:02.626 --> 37:04.494
Shut up!

37:04.529 --> 37:06.826
I told you "no" Sophia.

37:09.567 --> 37:10.533
Just drop it.

37:10.568 --> 37:12.502
Why do you think we're here?

37:12.537 --> 37:13.668
Why are they keeping you for so
long?

37:13.703 --> 37:14.834
Because I fucked up!

37:16.343 --> 37:18.508
Alright? I fucked up.

37:20.380 --> 37:23.414
And 300 people are dead because
of it.

37:23.845 --> 37:26.417
You don't get a medal for that.

37:26.782 --> 37:29.321
You don't get a second chance.

37:31.556 --> 37:32.852
I know why I'm here.

37:33.525 --> 37:33.985
Charles-

37:34.020 --> 37:35.822
And you!

37:37.122 --> 37:38.693
You need to go.

37:57.142 --> 37:58.713
Sophia.

38:02.620 --> 38:05.357
We have some sort of connection

38:05.557 --> 38:06.919
to each other.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.828
It's just this feeling.

38:14.863 --> 38:16.863
It's hard to describe.

38:18.031 --> 38:21.098
It's like string pulling me to
you.

38:25.874 --> 38:26.807
No...

38:26.842 --> 38:29.612
No, it's less than that.

38:30.450 --> 38:32.978
It's like a spiderweb.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.520
Just barely there.

38:37.490 --> 38:40.557
And when I follow a strand...

38:40.592 --> 38:43.692
it leads me to you.

38:43.727 --> 38:45.595
Always to you.

38:46.598 --> 38:48.664
What is this?

38:49.799 --> 38:52.063
What's happening to us?

38:53.473 --> 38:55.704
It's this place.

38:55.739 --> 38:57.068
It's them.

38:58.577 --> 39:00.170
All these doctors,

39:00.205 --> 39:03.041
the nurses, all the testing,

39:04.044 --> 39:06.550
all the pills.

39:06.783 --> 39:08.915
It's the real reason we're all
here.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.116
All of us.

39:15.660 --> 39:18.430
Do you think others have this?

39:18.795 --> 39:19.893
Like Charles?

39:20.764 --> 39:22.500
Maybe...

39:22.535 --> 39:24.799
I've heard voices...

39:25.670 --> 39:27.901
And there's this old man.

39:29.102 --> 39:30.937
An old man?

39:31.709 --> 39:33.808
He's been watching me since I
got here.

39:34.140 --> 39:36.041
He scares me.

39:36.780 --> 39:39.715
I won't let anything happen to
you, Sophia.

39:40.718 --> 39:43.015
But something already has
happened.

39:43.556 --> 39:46.557
They want this gift.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.152
For what though?

39:50.794 --> 39:52.860
To watch us all.

39:58.538 --> 40:00.505
And after that night,

40:00.540 --> 40:02.034
we were always

40:02.674 --> 40:04.036
connected.

40:04.071 --> 40:06.104
When did you know something was
wrong with Charles?

40:12.816 --> 40:13.650
He came to me.

40:13.685 --> 40:15.685
He came to you?

40:16.688 --> 40:17.489
In a dream?

40:17.524 --> 40:18.721
No.

40:19.592 --> 40:22.692
No, this wasn't what Eric and I
had.

40:41.779 --> 40:43.273
So-Sophia...

40:43.308 --> 40:46.045
Jesus Christ, Charles.

40:47.752 --> 40:51.182
S-s-s-Sophia...

40:53.087 --> 40:55.758
Please...

40:59.027 --> 41:01.258
I should have listened to you...

41:04.032 --> 41:05.735
I was...

41:08.201 --> 41:10.135
There was a man, he-

41:12.909 --> 41:14.271
A shadow.

41:14.746 --> 41:15.976
The old man?

41:17.716 --> 41:19.947
You've seen him too?

41:21.951 --> 41:23.280
Who is he?

41:24.657 --> 41:25.953
I don't know...

41:27.253 --> 41:29.990
But this place...

41:31.224 --> 41:32.256
It-it's-

41:33.094 --> 41:33.961
It's his-

41:36.130 --> 41:37.162
What's happening?

41:42.136 --> 41:43.674
He-help...

41:57.052 --> 42:00.757
If Charles didn't tell you to
come back here,
then why did you do it?

42:01.958 --> 42:04.761
Eric thought we'd find answers.

42:04.961 --> 42:07.291
Something's happened to Charles.

42:07.326 --> 42:09.359
They've taken him. Back there.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.196
How do you know that?

42:11.836 --> 42:13.638
He reached out to me.

42:14.003 --> 42:17.169
He reached out? Like us?

42:17.204 --> 42:19.710
Yeah, but it was different.

42:19.943 --> 42:22.273
I don't think Charles is like
us.

42:23.782 --> 42:25.716
This was desperate.

42:26.114 --> 42:28.114
And I think they killed him,
Erik.

42:28.149 --> 42:29.148
When was this.

42:30.184 --> 42:31.282
Earlier today.

42:31.317 --> 42:32.987
What did he tell you?

42:33.022 --> 42:35.660
That this place is not safe.

42:35.695 --> 42:37.761
- And it probably never was.
- Okay.

42:37.796 --> 42:39.092
Calm down.

42:39.127 --> 42:41.259
I won't let anything happen to
you, Sophia.

42:41.701 --> 42:43.360
How can you say that?

42:43.395 --> 42:45.131
We have no power in here.

42:45.166 --> 42:46.737
Yes, we do.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.101
And I think it's time to use it.

42:48.136 --> 42:49.872
What are you talking about?

42:49.907 --> 42:52.006
We need to find out
what happened to Charles.

42:52.041 --> 42:54.712
And we need to find out the
answers
for ourselves.

42:54.978 --> 42:58.980
The truth about what's going on
here.

42:59.015 --> 43:00.784
Everything they're hiding is
back there.

43:00.819 --> 43:02.049
That's where we need to go.

43:02.887 --> 43:04.249
But how?

43:05.021 --> 43:06.856
The doors have codes.

43:06.891 --> 43:08.825
But who has them?

43:08.860 --> 43:11.729
I've seen Robinson go back
there.

43:12.457 --> 43:14.864
I'm sorry I missed last night.

43:15.328 --> 43:19.132
Things have been really busy
downstairs.

43:19.167 --> 43:20.232
But it's good.

43:20.267 --> 43:21.772
It's all good.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.774
We're really pushing the program
forward.

43:24.205 --> 43:26.205
Just like you wanted.

43:26.878 --> 43:28.713
I wish you could be there with-

43:30.376 --> 43:32.717
But this is for the best.

43:32.752 --> 43:34.851
You needed your rest.

43:35.788 --> 43:38.382
You can't have another
breakdown.

43:39.253 --> 43:41.924
There's still so many ideas
inside
that mind.

43:43.059 --> 43:46.093
We need to think about the
future.

43:50.132 --> 43:52.132
I do you wish you would speak to
me...

43:52.937 --> 43:54.266
like before.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.040
I'm all alone down there.

43:59.911 --> 44:04.144
And you were always so
reassuring about...

44:04.179 --> 44:05.750
the work.

44:12.286 --> 44:14.792
What happened was necessary.

44:14.827 --> 44:16.926
We both know that.

44:17.126 --> 44:20.259
I just wish I'd hear you say it.

44:32.141 --> 44:35.241
Tell me about these dreams.

44:37.344 --> 44:39.146
I don't know what's real and
what's not.

44:40.149 --> 44:42.380
How have you been sleeping?

44:42.415 --> 44:43.414
Not good.

44:44.021 --> 44:45.317
Okay.

44:45.352 --> 44:47.418
We'll add some sleeping pills
to the regimen.

44:47.453 --> 44:48.089
Tell me-

45:17.021 --> 45:18.317
What did you do to me?

45:18.352 --> 45:19.483
I'm sorry.

45:23.390 --> 45:24.994
They-

45:25.029 --> 45:26.897
They never told me what it was
for.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.998
Just calm down.

45:29.033 --> 45:31.429
Listen, Julie, we need some
help.

45:32.839 --> 45:34.872
You need to leave.

45:46.083 --> 45:49.051
Momma, where are you?

45:58.590 --> 46:00.931
Momma had to go sweetie...

46:01.263 --> 46:04.099
You shouldn't have to go.

46:04.134 --> 46:06.563
I know, baby.

46:06.598 --> 46:09.203
And I'm sorry about that, okay?

46:09.601 --> 46:11.436
Do you remember Mommy?

46:11.471 --> 46:15.242
I never-I never forget you.

46:16.443 --> 46:18.949
Good, sweetie.

46:19.611 --> 46:21.545
Momma's coming for you, okay?

46:22.955 --> 46:24.119
He's yours.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.488
Yes.

46:30.523 --> 46:33.590
What's his name?

46:33.625 --> 46:34.965
Noah.

46:35.528 --> 46:38.529
He was young here when I left.

46:38.564 --> 46:41.070
He should be reading by now.

46:41.105 --> 46:42.973
He looks like you.

46:45.241 --> 46:47.846
I'd give anything to be with him
now.

46:48.145 --> 46:49.375
Where is he now?

46:49.410 --> 46:51.278
My mother took him

46:51.313 --> 46:53.247
behind the Eastern line.

46:53.282 --> 46:54.182
I'm sure he's safe.

46:57.319 --> 47:00.353
I didn't appreciate the time we
had together.

47:02.962 --> 47:05.589
I didn't want to be a mom. I
wasn't ready.

47:06.262 --> 47:09.362
I was too scared to have a kid
that when I got drafted...

47:11.003 --> 47:13.036
I was excited.

47:15.304 --> 47:17.436
I couldn't wait to go.

47:18.505 --> 47:19.339
Sophia-

47:19.374 --> 47:21.176
Don't, it's...

47:22.608 --> 47:24.080
It's fine.

47:24.313 --> 47:26.544
It's my shit to deal with.

47:28.284 --> 47:31.582
But I guarantee that once I'm
out of here,

47:32.189 --> 47:35.388
no excuses, no running

47:36.193 --> 47:38.897
He's all that matters now.

47:41.165 --> 47:43.000
Let's get you back to him.

52:07.695 --> 52:09.332
Charles...

52:21.610 --> 52:22.246
Pl-please...

52:52.410 --> 52:54.839
You can go fuck yourself,
Ranson.

53:04.851 --> 53:06.587
Fuck...

53:07.359 --> 53:08.523
Fuck you!

53:08.558 --> 53:10.525
I know who you are!

53:10.560 --> 53:13.297
I know what you do back here!
I saw what you did to Charles!

53:13.332 --> 53:14.925
I know everything!

53:14.960 --> 53:16.630
- ugh!
- You think

53:16.665 --> 53:19.270
because you've had a glimpse
behind the curtain

53:19.305 --> 53:22.735
you know all the secrets of this
place.

53:23.408 --> 53:24.869
You know nothing.

53:24.904 --> 53:27.839
You have nothing.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.381
- You murdered Charles.
- Yes!

53:31.416 --> 53:34.351
Charles and many others.

53:34.551 --> 53:36.518
As you saw.

53:38.819 --> 53:41.688
You think you have some secret

53:41.723 --> 53:44.889
that'll keep you alive in here.

53:45.595 --> 53:47.023
You don't.

53:47.058 --> 53:49.267
We know it all.

53:49.599 --> 53:51.698
Or will know it all.

53:51.733 --> 53:53.931
It just takes time.

53:54.670 --> 53:56.373
Every movement

53:56.408 --> 54:00.036
and every moment of every
patient
is recorded here.

54:00.742 --> 54:03.677
Since the day they arrive...

54:03.712 --> 54:07.417
until the day we decide to end
them.

54:07.452 --> 54:08.847
All those people.

54:08.882 --> 54:13.720
This is not a place people
survive, Sophia.

54:13.755 --> 54:16.393
Not even you.

55:10.713 --> 55:13.142
Ranson. Where is Eric?

55:13.177 --> 55:15.144
Did you kill him?

55:15.179 --> 55:16.882
Like Charles?

55:17.720 --> 55:20.149
Oh you've been deceived,
Sophia...

55:20.184 --> 55:21.425
Horribly.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.855
Stop fucking with me!

55:22.890 --> 55:23.988
Where is he?

55:24.023 --> 55:27.860
There is no Eric, Sophia.

55:28.665 --> 55:30.401
What?

55:32.801 --> 55:34.570
The old man...

55:36.101 --> 55:39.476
- Charles said this place was
his-
- Was...

55:39.511 --> 55:39.938
His.

55:39.973 --> 55:42.941
Who is he?

55:42.976 --> 55:45.977
A much bigger problem than I
thought.

55:47.519 --> 55:48.815
But why Erik?

55:48.850 --> 55:49.948
To use you.

55:49.983 --> 55:51.653
And your power.

55:51.688 --> 55:53.754
To regain control of this place.

55:56.121 --> 55:58.088
But that's not going to happen.

56:00.763 --> 56:02.092
What's going to happen?

56:02.127 --> 56:03.566
Guards.

56:03.601 --> 56:05.568
- Ranson.
- Get her to surgery.

56:05.603 --> 56:07.130
Wait...

56:07.165 --> 56:10.166
No! No no no no no!
Ranson! Ranson!

56:10.201 --> 56:11.805
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

56:11.840 --> 56:12.707
Get off of me!

56:12.742 --> 56:15.171
Get-get-Ranson! Ranson!

56:15.206 --> 56:17.745
Get off of me! No!

56:17.780 --> 56:20.451
No! Let me go!

56:20.486 --> 56:24.521
No! No! Ranson!
Let me go!

56:46.072 --> 56:47.610
Eh, let's get her vitals.

56:50.010 --> 56:53.583
Come on people, we're not paid
by the hour, let's get it done.

57:06.092 --> 57:07.190
Sophia...

57:37.156 --> 57:39.530
Hello, Sophia.

57:43.162 --> 57:45.602
Nurse.

57:45.637 --> 57:46.834
Please release the patient.

57:46.869 --> 57:48.000
Excuse me.

57:48.035 --> 57:51.003
Unbind her straps.

57:51.038 --> 57:54.105
I won't ask again.

57:54.140 --> 57:55.172
Of course.

58:07.054 --> 58:08.724
What are you doing?

58:09.320 --> 58:10.825
No!

58:23.004 --> 58:26.742
Why didn't you tell me about
her, Julie?

58:27.338 --> 58:32.583
Luckily we caught her before she
caused too much trouble.

58:33.751 --> 58:35.047
Still...

58:35.082 --> 58:37.049
Dr. Ranson, I don't know how
she-

58:37.084 --> 58:40.151
Did you give her that code,
or did she take it from you?

58:40.186 --> 58:43.154
- I-I-I don't know. I don't know
how she-
- So she took it from you.

58:43.189 --> 58:46.729
- I don't know how she-
- And yet you did nothing...

58:46.764 --> 58:48.830
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

58:52.066 --> 58:55.199
You should've told me.

59:51.323 --> 59:53.125
Where the fuck is Gonzalez,
people?

59:53.831 --> 59:55.897
- Stop what you're doing!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:58.462 --> 59:59.934
I'm getting out.

59:59.969 --> 1:00:01.067
Show me the exit.

1:00:01.102 --> 1:00:02.805
They're not showing you shit.

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:05.808
You got 3 minutes before SEC
team 2 is down here.

1:00:05.843 --> 1:00:08.239
Show me the goddamn exit!
I swear to God I'll kill him!

1:00:08.274 --> 1:00:10.340
Fuck you, Gonzalez!
You're not getting out of here.

1:00:10.375 --> 1:00:11.715
Do not believe her.

1:00:11.750 --> 1:00:13.145
She's bluffing.

1:00:20.352 --> 1:00:21.758
I'm not.

1:00:21.793 --> 1:00:23.287
Open the fucking door.

1:00:52.252 --> 1:00:53.691
It's done.

1:00:54.023 --> 1:00:55.319
Pick up the tablet.

1:00:55.354 --> 1:00:56.386
Show me where.

1:01:01.261 --> 1:01:02.227
You're going there.

1:04:27.302 --> 1:04:29.434
Why hasn't she killed you?

1:04:29.667 --> 1:04:32.239
She needs me. I'm her proof.

1:04:32.538 --> 1:04:35.374
The only success we've had
here...

1:04:35.409 --> 1:04:36.276
till you.

1:04:37.576 --> 1:04:39.180
Why me?

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:43.118
You have my gift. You're the
only one who can help me.

1:04:45.683 --> 1:04:47.584
Do you understand now?

1:04:47.619 --> 1:04:50.290
Why I came to you like this?

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:54.525
Yes. You needed to use me.

1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:58.496
I had to. I couldn't risk losing
you.

1:04:59.598 --> 1:05:01.433
I'm not here for you anymore.

1:05:01.468 --> 1:05:05.008
- What about Noah?
- Don't say his name.

1:05:05.439 --> 1:05:08.374
I can get you back to him.

1:05:08.409 --> 1:05:10.211
How?

1:05:11.709 --> 1:05:15.018
My body is as good as dead...

1:05:17.286 --> 1:05:19.451
Take my consciousness.

1:05:22.423 --> 1:05:23.620
No.

1:05:25.591 --> 1:05:27.162
You don't have a choice.

1:06:04.366 --> 1:06:07.400
Let go, Sophia! She's coming up!

1:06:08.073 --> 1:06:12.042
Let me in our we'll both die!
She won't keep me here any
longer!

1:06:16.675 --> 1:06:18.642
No! No!

1:06:26.553 --> 1:06:29.554
Let go!

1:08:20.601 --> 1:08:21.600
