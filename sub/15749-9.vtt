00:00.100 --> 00:02.200
You're quite beautiful,
you know that?

00:04.240 --> 00:06.640
Who's the artist?
He's called Roderick Temple.

00:06.680 --> 00:10.960
You have a very lovely daughter.
Don't use her to get close to me.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.720
I've got a chance of my own restaurant.
This person might back me. Wonderful! Who is it?

00:15.760 --> 00:17.840
There's a place come up
in Windmill Street.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.760
Don't rush me, dear heart.
Hettie's hardly in her grave,

00:20.800 --> 00:22.640
and here i am with you.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.320
Perhaps we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.680
Miss Love is taking a
principal role in my new play.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.080
Miss Hawkins is to become
Senior Assistant to Miss Mardle.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.400
You don't steal
from your work family!

00:34.440 --> 00:36.360
If you could just give her
a reference.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.440
I don't write references
for people who are dishonest.

00:40.000 --> 01:10.000

01:12.240 --> 01:14.240
It's early. Come back to bed.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Stop! I was nearly late for work
twice last week.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.360
Hmm. Let's make it really late then.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.160
It's all right...
It's all right for you, Mr Leclair.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.880
It doesn't matter what time
you turn up.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.080
You'd just be off, being artistic.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.440
I don't want to lose my job.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.680
But you might want to...
What?

01:36.720 --> 01:39.040
Make yourself...

01:39.080 --> 01:41.080
presentable.
Oh.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.800
Agnes!
I've been meaning to thank you.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.600
What for?
Inspiring me.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.360
I went straight to Mr Selfridge.
My heart was pounding.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.040
But i gave him the ice cream idea,
and he said yes.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.600
Aw! Victor, good for you!

02:04.640 --> 02:07.040
Now i've got to do the same thing
with my backer.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.960
Make sure she gives me a straight
answer. How could she say no?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.800
You're Victor Colleano!
Get out of it.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.720
Here. Watch out.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.080
There you go, Miss Towler.
Ready for work.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.560 --> 02:44.480
You'd prefer to go riding
than come in to the store today?

02:45.680 --> 02:47.680
Well, Pa... if you wouldn't mind.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.080
Maybe i could come some other week?
I suppose not.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.600
It's just one problem with that.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.560
What's the problem?
This week, next week?

02:55.600 --> 02:58.320
Well...

02:58.360 --> 03:04.320
next week, we do not have
Sir Ernest Shackleton coming in.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.240
But still, maybe you can meet him
another time.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.520
You mean it, Pa? 
Shackleton!

03:10.240 --> 03:13.760
Coming to our store?
Our store. OUR store, is it?

03:13.800 --> 03:18.360
Oh, Lois, look, flowers from Harry.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.960
That's so sweet. The bouquet is
for Miss Rosalie, Ma'am.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
- Flowers!
- For me?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.640
They're for me
to practise my drawing.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
Look, it's Mr Temple's card!

03:34.760 --> 03:37.320
Give them to me.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.080
Give them to me!

03:39.120 --> 03:41.120
And the card.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.640
Fraser, could you return these
to Mr Temple,

03:45.680 --> 03:47.680
and if any more are sent
from that address,

03:47.720 --> 03:50.840
could you just refuse them at the
door? Certainly, Mrs Selfridge.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.680
Thank you.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.600
He only wanted
to do something encouraging,

04:02.640 --> 04:05.200
seeing as he seems to be banned
from this house.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.760
You are a 17-year-old girl.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.840
A grown man has no business
sending you flowers.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.920
Your mother's quite right, Rosalie.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.959
You want to treat me like a baby,
then i'll act like a baby.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.680
I'm staying in my room.
I'm not coming to the store later!

04:22.720 --> 04:25.960
You will do as i say, young lady.
What's wrong with Rosalie?

04:28.040 --> 04:31.400
That man has been in our house
and used Rosalie to get to you,

04:31.440 --> 04:34.200
and you didn't think fit to tell me?
I'm sorry, Harry.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.080
I thought i'd handled the situation.
You handled it poorly by the looks of things.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.040
I made a mistake.
So, can we just think of Rosalie,

04:41.080 --> 04:46.040
how best to handle this for her?
I will wring his neck if he comes near her again.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.000
And what about you, Rose?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.200
He seems to be pretty persistent
for a man

04:50.240 --> 04:52.120
who simply painted your portrait.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.480
What's that supposed to mean?
You tell me.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.120
I told you...

04:57.160 --> 04:59.160
nothing happened between us.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
Can i get some service, please?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.960
Is there ANYONE here
to help me?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.680
Excuse me?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.320
Where is everybody?

05:25.880 --> 05:29.360
What's going on, Grove? There are
staff missing from every department.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.240
And we opened our doors
a full five minutes late.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.840
I have to confess,
I have no idea, Mr Selfridge.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.880
An outbreak of dysentery, perhaps.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.040
You hear of these things. Then
surely we would have received word.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.480
Any notes been delivered?
Any telephone calls?

05:44.520 --> 05:48.000
Nothing. Not a word.
Only two serving on Accessories.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.320
You're our Chief of Staff,
aren't you?

05:50.360 --> 05:52.360
But where's our staff?

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
Excuse me.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.320
- Mr Selfridge, Miss Mardle.
- Oh.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.720
Miss Mardle, where's your staff?
It's just myself and Miss Miller. I'm completely mystified by it.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.960
If your department has taken time off
for some London Spectacle,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.080
I'll be really annoyed, Miss Mardle.
Of course, Mr Selfridge.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.240
I-i hardly imagine they would be.
Wouldn't you say so, Mr Grove?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
I really don't know what to think.

06:18.160 --> 06:22.120
Miss Hawkins, where have you been?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Miss Mardle.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.200
Bond Street underground station.
We got stuck.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.680
I managed to get free because
my carriage wasn't in the tunnel.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.320
I expect the rest will be
along shortly, Mr Selfridge.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.560
Excuse me. Service!
Oh, excuse me.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.600
Right, well, Mr Grove...

06:37.640 --> 06:39.400
you know what we have to do.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.560
I'll be wearing grey.
The gloves have to be complimentary.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.040
I feel these may not be
conservative enough.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.080
Too conservative by far,
in my opinion.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
Try these on.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.960
Imagine the red against the grey.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.240
Conservative coat, and then
that little twist of excitement

07:02.280 --> 07:04.200
that the French
have mastered so well.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.200
You think so?
Well, what do you think?

07:07.240 --> 07:09.360
That's what's my Pa always says.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.520
Why, i love them, young man.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.840
You've got ecru, orchid, flax,
various off-whites and ivories.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.240
I want as many textures
as possible.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.120
Have we got silk and gauze?
Oh, i'll get them to you.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.680
Right now, i need to focus on
manning the department.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.000
I'm down three staff with Miss Towler
on the Antarctica window.

07:32.040 --> 07:37.160
I don't mean to leave you in the lurch.
Oh, i'll be fine. The window's of vital importance.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.200
London will want to see
how we pay tribute

07:39.240 --> 07:41.600
to Sir Ernest Shackleton
and his doughty men.

07:41.640 --> 07:45.480
My being short of help is hardly up there
with glaciers and crevasses now, is it?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.480
In another life, you would have
made a formidable explorer yourself.

07:49.520 --> 07:54.520
In another life, i'd be chess champion of Great Britain.
Who knows - perhaps i still might.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.440
Mr Crabb, how can i help you?

07:58.480 --> 08:01.080
How can i help YOU, Miss Ravillious?

08:03.880 --> 08:08.640
I'm sorry, Madam,
I couldn't quite hear.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.320
Oh, yes. Of course.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.360
Mr Crabb, would you mind
asking Miss Mardle

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
to assist in this department?

08:21.440 --> 08:24.400
You could take her place
in Accessories.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.039
What item of undergarment was Madam
wishing to see?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.039
This is very nice.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.400
I have the perfect, little beret
to go with this intricate plaid. But too fussy, i fear.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.760
Oh, but tartan is perfect
for a jacket.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.799
See the pattern against your skin.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.640
Now, jaunty little beret atop,

08:46.680 --> 08:49.920
matching drawstring purse,
burnished dark leather gloves.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.160
Just perfect! I have
the ideal worsted wool for you.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.600
Hmm. Maybe this is a little
too plain.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.560
I'll take some coffee
and i'll come back.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.960
Miss Mardle, it may be different
in Accessories,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.240
but the cardinal rule
in the Fashion Department

09:09.280 --> 09:12.680
is to listen - listen properly,
to the customer's requirements.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.360
We believe in the power
of suggestion in Accessories.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.720
You might want to take that
on board.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.920
I know how to run my own department.
While you are here, you will do things my way.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.280
Last time i checked, this was a
department store not a dictatorship.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.000
Ladies! Ladies! Please.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.360
Thank goodness. Staff.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.880
I realise as Heads
of your respective departments,

09:34.920 --> 09:38.000
this has been a difficult morning
for both of you.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.560
You may return to your own position,
Miss Mardle. Thank you, Mr Grove.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.120
Sorry, Mr Selfridge.
Don't worry.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.840
Transport problems happen.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.880
No, couldn't be helped.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.960
You see, Gordon, it's important
to support the people who work here.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.920
Mr Grove.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.160
The Station Master has sent word
to you personally, Mr Selfridge.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.680
I hardly expect an apology
for delays on the train.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.560
It was a body on the tracks that
caused the delays, Mr Selfridge.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.480
They have identified the body
through her personal belongings.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
I'm very sorry, sir.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.160
It was Miss Bunting.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.800
She erm... she fell on the line
earlier this morning.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.920
Miss Bunting.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.040
They found this in her purse.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.280
It's addressed to you personally,
Mr Selfridge.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.680
Who's Miss Bunting, Pa?

10:50.560 --> 10:56.520
Why did she fall
in front of a train? Pa?

11:03.240 --> 11:07.320
Pa... if she stole from you...

11:07.360 --> 11:09.360
didn't you HAVE to sack her?

11:11.200 --> 11:16.920
Well, the straight answer is yes,
but life runs crookedly sometimes.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.600
She stole to buy medicine
for someone she loved.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.560
And i never let her explain
that to me.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.960
Mr Edwards to see you, Mr Selfridge.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.600
Oh. Miss Blenkinsop,
why don't you take Master Gordon

11:33.640 --> 11:36.280
to the Soda Fountain?
Certainly, Mr Selfridge.

11:40.760 --> 11:44.200
Hello, Master Gordon. Here to see
Shacks, the hero of all heroes?

11:44.240 --> 11:47.280
Yep. 97 miles from the
South Pole and he turns back.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.880
Turns back!
To save the lives of his men.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
That's a mark of a true leader, eh?

11:53.480 --> 11:57.000
Harry, old boy, i'm here to tell you
that today is your lucky day.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.800
Ah, it doesn't feel like it, Frank.
It will be when you hear what i've got to say.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.920
I'm all yours!

12:02.960 --> 12:05.320
What? Uh... change of ownership
at the paper.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.280
My face and my politics
no longer fit.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.080
So, in a nutshell, i need a job.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.880
Today may not be the best day, Frank.
I was thinking Press Officer, or...

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
Let me-let me think about it.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.320
Sorry, old boy, but if the loan sharks find out i'm unemployed,
I might be in a spot of bother.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
Harry?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Are you listening?

12:31.880 --> 12:36.480
I'm sorry, Frank. Today's not a great day for me
to think about taking on anyone new.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.680
Good to know where a fellow stands.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.960
Miss Miller... I was looking for you.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.040
Oh, sorry i wasn't at my station,
i was...

13:04.560 --> 13:06.560
I was just...

13:08.160 --> 13:11.160
You did everything you could
for Miss Bunting, Doris.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.360
You mustn't think there was
anything else you could have done.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.280
She must've lost all hope
to do a thing like that.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.840
We all feel guilty when
something awful like this happens.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.200
I can't help thinking...

13:30.240 --> 13:33.440
I should just have simply
written her a reference myself.

13:34.280 --> 13:38.760
I can understand how desperate she must have been,
tending for an invalid at home.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
It isn't easy.

13:41.240 --> 13:46.080
Your late wife, of course. It must
be bringing it all back for you.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.120
And here i am, crying in a corner.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.280
Oh, i'm so sorry.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.320
You're a kind and caring person,
Doris.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.400
I tell you what...

14:03.440 --> 14:06.960
Miss Bunting always enjoyed
your time in the tea room together.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.440
What say we share a cup of tea
in her honour there, this evening?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
Would that help?

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
Yes, i think it would.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.960
Thank you, Mr Grove.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.320
You think i'm being unfair.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.920
Making decisions over your head.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.720
Yes, actually.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.000
And... you're not even explaining why

14:42.040 --> 14:46.840
Mr Temple is fine
for painting your portrait,
but not fine for tutoring me.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.600
Tutoring you, when it's quite clear

14:48.640 --> 14:51.720
that you've developed
an infatuation for him? Who says...?

14:57.320 --> 14:59.840
Here's what i want
to explain to you, darling.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.640
You're a young girl.
Oh, not that again.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.240
Hear me out.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.920
Allowances can be made
for young girls

15:09.960 --> 15:12.080
behaving in an inappropriate manner.

15:13.040 --> 15:17.360
But when a man turns up at a house
without prior invitation

15:17.400 --> 15:22.960
from a girl's parents'
and then remains in a room...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.520
un-chaperoned with that young girl,

15:25.560 --> 15:28.760
and then sends her flowers
though he's been told to stay away,

15:28.800 --> 15:31.960
well, it'd be
a very poor mother indeed

15:32.000 --> 15:35.160
who wouldn't worry about...
such a man.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.440
Maybe you'll be a mother
yourself one day.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.400
I'd like to think that i showed you
the right example.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.880
I'm not saying your feelings
aren't real, sweetheart.

15:58.440 --> 16:03.960
I have this sort of... pain
in my stomach when i think of him.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.520
And the right man at the right time
will take that pain away.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.360
To your stations, ladies, please.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.000
Back to work now.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.840
We've all had a nasty shock,
but we do have a store to run.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.160
Doris! That's the second
glove stretcher you've dropped today.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.160
Sorry, Kitty.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.920
I can't get Miss Bunting
out of my head.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.120
You'll just have to pull
yourself together.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.040
Same as the rest of us.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.880
I need to know i can rely
on junior staff.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.760
Well, of course you can rely on me,
Kitty.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.400
And i think - i think that now
that i'm Senior Assistant -

16:52.440 --> 16:55.320
it would be better if we used
our formal titles.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.680
Well, how-how do you mean, Kitty?
How do you mean... Miss Hawkins.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.960
Very well...

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Miss Hawkins.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
Thank you, Miss Mardle.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.720
I think Mr Leclair will find
these accessories most helpful.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.839
My condolences on your former
colleague, Miss Mardle.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.160
Friend, Miss Ravillious.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.360
And indeed, i wish i had been a far
better friend to poor Miss Bunting.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.800
Mr Selfridge.
Can you see to arrangements for...

17:59.840 --> 18:03.120
Miss Bunting's funeral?
Certainly, Mr Selfridge.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.720
Make sure we cover all costs.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.520
Would you like me to attend
the funeral on your behalf, Mr Selfridge?

18:09.560 --> 18:12.280
Thank you, but i'll be attending
on my own behalf.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.240
Sir Ernest will be arriving
in five minutes, Mr Selfridge.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.000
Do you still intend
to greet him personally?

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
Of-of course i do.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
He'll be very upset.

18:33.880 --> 18:38.720
If only... if only Miss Bunting
hadn't given up all hope.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.200
Life is full of 'if onlys'.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.960
I should be here, i could be there.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.080
This path or that path?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.800
Do we know what we really want?

19:03.720 --> 19:07.160
Us being...

19:07.200 --> 19:11.280
well... complicates things,
doesn't it?

19:24.600 --> 19:27.160
I need a few moments of your time,
Miss Towler.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.240
Back in our department.
Certainly, Miss Ravillious.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.880
You wanted me for something,
Miss Ravillious?

19:45.920 --> 19:48.440
I'm not a fool, Miss Towler.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.720
Let's begin there and move on
from that point.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.680
Yes, Miss Ravillious.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.560
I specifically asked for you
to join my department.

19:56.840 --> 20:00.200
If you are indulging
in an inappropriate relationship,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.840
then i need to consider
how that will affect my department.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.400
However, allowances
might be taken into account

20:06.440 --> 20:09.520
in the case of true
and unavoidable feelings.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.720
But you'll need to tell me...

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
are you in love with Mr Leclair?

20:18.240 --> 20:20.240
No.

20:21.480 --> 20:26.440
I erm... I like him very much,
but no, i'm not in love with him.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.640
Then think of your career, Agnes.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.040
Harry Selfridge! Good to see you
beyond the poker tables.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.720
I won't be quick to put myself up
for a trouncing again.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.860
Great to see you again, Sir Ernest.
Oh, Ernest, please, Harry.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.560
I keep having to look over my
shoulder whenever someone says sir.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.880
Last photographs, gentlemen,
if you don't mind.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.560
Sir Ernest -
When will you return to Antarctica?

21:05.600 --> 21:09.120
Do you think the South Pole
can still be bagged for His Majesty?

21:09.160 --> 21:13.560
Oh, uh... what about you, young man?
What's your name?

21:13.600 --> 21:17.200
Uh, erm... erm... Gordon, sir.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.840
Gordon Selfridge.
Ah, a chip off the old block eh?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.080
Well, i'm sure you've a question.
Most young fellas have.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.200
I-i'd like to know what you
think would make a good leader.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.240
That's a good question.
I'll have to think about that.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.880
The thing is, when you're
up to your unmentionables

21:34.920 --> 21:39.160
in trying to be a good leader,
you don't have time to think about what that is.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.000
Wouldn't you say so, Harry? I would
certainly agree with you there.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.920
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.880
Would you care to see our
new outdoor equipment, Sir Ernest?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.840
I'm not an easy man to impress,
Harry.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.680
Well, exploring Selfridge's
is no ordinary experience.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.120
Besides, we have
a little surprise for you.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.720
Frank. What a nice surprise.

22:02.760 --> 22:06.840
Ellen, a party. That's two rejections today.
I'm liable to break out in a rash.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.680
Sounds lively. Come in.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.960
We are rehearsing Tony's new play.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.680
Or, at least, we were until things
took a frivolous side.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.520
Travers.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.720
Frank.
So, who's been rejecting you, Frank?

22:28.160 --> 22:31.280
Shall i go and beast them for you?
Oh, would that you could.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.400
But i'm afraid
it's our mutual friend.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.520
Mr Selfridge. I see.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.360
Oh, cheers. Right, let's try
something slightly...

22:45.400 --> 22:48.200
Come and lend us your expertise
with words, Frank.

22:53.120 --> 22:57.400
Tony thinks we're nearly there,
but i'd like your opinion.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.680
Editorial is more my thing,
to tell the truth.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.840
Don't sell yourself short, Frank.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.920
I'm sure you could help us with a
few little snippets of information.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
I say, this is hot stuff.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.320
We like to think so.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.880
I'm hoping it's going to turn
my career around, Frank.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.960
Yes.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
Shall i top you up?

23:35.560 --> 23:39.480
Well, well, well.
It's the very model we took South.

23:39.520 --> 23:43.120
Right down to the specially designed,
air-cooled, four litre engine.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.280
Harry, i am confounded.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.240
The darn thing worked
for all of two minutes,

23:49.280 --> 23:52.920
but, still, it paid its way in
photographs. We know how that works.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.160
What have you found, Master Gordon?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.360
Ah. Finnesko, we call those.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.480
Lapp boots
made from reindeer leg fur.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.240
Is that what you use to line
the sleeping bags?

24:04.280 --> 24:09.800
You know your stuff and no mistake. It's horrid though 
when it starts shedding and ends up in your mouth.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.680
This is a fine display.
You must've gone to endless trouble.

24:12.720 --> 24:18.560
You're not the only one i was trying to impress. 
A certain young man's clued up on his exploring equipment.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.360
Grove...

24:22.400 --> 24:25.240
how are the staff doing?
Are they bearing up?

24:25.280 --> 24:30.080
Of course, chief.
I think everyone just wishes
Miss Bunting had come to one of us.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.480
And these gloves?
Can you hazard a guess?

24:32.520 --> 24:35.320
Erm... wolf skin?

24:35.360 --> 24:38.000
Indeed. From Mollers of Drammen,
I'm assuming?

24:38.840 --> 24:41.520
Of course. The finest
fur specialists in all the world.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.080
If you ever go exploring, young man,
be sure to put in your order with Mollers.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.000
Pa wants me to run the store someday. 
It's just..

24:49.040 --> 24:52.360
I don't think i'll fit in
exploring, as well.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.880
Where do you think all this
wonderful stuff comes from, Gordon?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.280
There's a lot of exploring
to be done right here.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.640
How many staff, Harry?
Over 3,000.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.000
That's a heck of a lot
of people to lead, young man.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.360
Give me a raggle taggle handful,
out on a block of ice any day.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.760
George Towler! What are you doing
on the shop floor?

25:24.800 --> 25:28.720
You're not supposed to be up here. 
It's all right. I've a good mind to report you.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.760
Get back down to the loading bay.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.200
My foreman made me
store porter for the day,

25:35.240 --> 25:37.280
with a view to
a full-time promotion.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.600
It's my big chance.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.360
I thought you might be pleased
for me, Miss Kitty.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
Yes, but...

25:49.480 --> 25:51.480
Maybe i was a bit...

25:53.120 --> 25:55.120
Good luck to you, George.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.120
Go on. Say it then.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.280
Say what, Miss Hawkins? Say i've
let a bit of power go to my head,

26:07.320 --> 26:09.320
and i've been behaving like a...

26:10.920 --> 26:12.960
..like a complete idiot.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.360
Oh, Doris.
Oh, Kitty. Oh, Doris!

26:19.360 --> 26:24.360
'Make friends make friends, never ever break friends. 
If you do -''You'll catch the flu'.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.360
Do you want a cuppa
and a curranty bun after work then?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.320
Oh, oh, i've already got plans
this evening, Kitty.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.200
Tomorrow instead?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.880
Mm-hm.
Tomorrow it is then.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.000
Mr Perez?

26:46.040 --> 26:50.440
I have heard Fortnum and Mason are
promoting a special afternoon tea.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.720
I wondered if you'd like me
to check out what they are offering.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.240
A little jaunt you mean,
Mr Colleano?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
No, i don't think so.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.760
I just thought Mr Selfridge
loved the ice cream idea.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.200
Remember?
I thought he might be pleased...

27:06.240 --> 27:08.360
if you could get any information.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.560
Hmm. Yes, maybe you're right.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.720
Be quick as you can,
we've got to set up for the lecture.

27:16.760 --> 27:21.400
And of course, you'll bring the information to me
and not to Mr Selfridge direct.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.440
Of course, Mr Perez.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.360
What do you think?
I love it.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.840
But we need something
to bring it back to...

27:38.880 --> 27:42.960
Humanity? Hmm.
Yes, i like the sentiment.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So do i.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.840
Forgive me, i should introduce...

27:56.880 --> 27:59.360
Agnes Towler. Pleased to meet you.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.400
Valerie Maurel. Enchantee.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.880
The erm... the 'look' in New York,
may i ask?

28:08.560 --> 28:11.920
No. Paris, from top to toe.
Of course.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.040
Of course.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.560
Well, i could get on
with the window,

28:19.600 --> 28:22.200
if you want to spend some time
with Miss Maurel?

28:23.200 --> 28:25.600
Uh... the window is all yours,
Miss Towler.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.040
Yes?
Mr Colleano's here, Lady Loxley.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.240
To discuss some menus.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
Show him in, Fludd.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.840
Victor.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.800
I don't remember any discussion
about menus.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.080
I'm here about the restaurant.
The one i told you about?

29:04.440 --> 29:07.240
Now, look, just hear me out.
It's the perfect location.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.320
Near all the shops. Great for trade.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.080
Now, i told you Victor,
I won't be rushed on this.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.960
You barge in here without invitation.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.160
If i decide to help,
it will be on my terms.

29:16.200 --> 29:20.080
It could be ages before we find
a spot like this again.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.400
'We'? If you were to back me,
we'd be in it together.

29:23.440 --> 29:27.680
You'd get an excellent return. You're mistaken 
if you think my allowance from Lord Loxley

29:27.720 --> 29:29.680
would run to that level of financing.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.120
But you know people, don't you?

29:32.160 --> 29:35.040
You're always on the look out
to back the next sure thing?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.200
Victor, Victor, dear heart.

29:39.840 --> 29:44.840
It isn't like finding a backer
for a... well, a Mr Selfridge, say.

29:45.640 --> 29:49.520
You're young,
you're unknown and you're unproven.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
Ah. I get it.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.680
We have fun, don't we?

30:00.080 --> 30:03.160
I enjoy your company.
Don't you enjoy mine?

30:04.440 --> 30:10.160
Course i do. But you shouldn't have said 
you'll help me if you had no intention of doing so.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.000
Ooh! That's me told off.

30:15.960 --> 30:19.560
Look, Victor,
I might be able to help.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.600
But it could take some time.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.200
And why such a rush?

30:28.240 --> 30:32.360
There will be other restaurants,
and you'll be that much more mature.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.280
So...

30:36.320 --> 30:39.240
why fall out
over such a trifling matter.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
Trifling to you.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.400
But i suppose, so am i.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.520
No.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.800
Oh, no.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.080
You're very special to me, Victor.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.400
Not special enough
for you to believe in me, though.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.680
And that's what counts
the most with me.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.240
So, i reckon it's goodbye,
Lady Loxley.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.040
No hard feelings, eh?

31:11.840 --> 31:13.800
Victor!

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
Don't be so...

31:18.880 --> 31:20.880
You'll regret this.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.760
Victor?

31:26.040 --> 31:29.280
Are you happy with this light?
Yes, we'll start with this one.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.160
Well?

31:35.240 --> 31:37.880
Fortnum and Mason -
you haven't reported to me.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.400
Oh, sorry, Mr Perez.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.160
It's just we've been off our feet
since i got back.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.160
Apparently, they haven't
got around to it yet.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.720
Mate of mine is a waiter there.
He's promised to keep me updated.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
Thank you.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.080
Rose. Ma.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.120
Welcome!

32:00.360 --> 32:04.120
Rosalie couldn't come?
Oh... she's here somewhere. Hmm.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
There she is.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.280
Who's that young man
she's talking to?

32:12.440 --> 32:14.440
It's uh..

32:14.480 --> 32:16.480
Roddy Temple.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.560
Here, at my store? I'll speak to him.
I'll handle Mr Temple, Rose.

32:25.920 --> 32:30.720
You will leave and not return. You will not speak 
to any member of my family ever again.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.840
Shackleton's lecture is open
to the public, is it not?

32:34.040 --> 32:36.880
I make polite conversation
with a charming young lady.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.640
That charming young lady
happens to be my daughter.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.840
Well, your wife had plenty
to say to me.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.880
I'd stop now.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.920
I don't know
why she stays with you.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.760
I mean, she's sweet and she's funny.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.640
Don't presume
to talk about my wife.

32:51.680 --> 32:55.320
Yet, you publicly humiliate her
with the likes of Ellen Love.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.480
You don't deserve a woman like Rose.
I will throw you out.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.360
See, this is the problem, you
think you can control everything,

33:02.400 --> 33:05.160
don't you, Selfridge?
Well, you can't.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.920
Even though she may not be able
to admit to it just now,

33:08.960 --> 33:11.520
your wife is in love with me.
Don't talk about my wife.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
Don't take me on.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.920
What can you do to me?
I can destroy you.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.880
Can you? One word from me
and there isn't a gallery on Earth

33:19.920 --> 33:22.200
that will exhibit so much
as one of your doodles.

33:22.240 --> 33:26.480
I can see to it that your work is
publicly mocked by the art critics.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.480
Do you want to take that chance?

33:34.760 --> 33:37.240
You are a silly boy. Now get out.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
Before i throw you out.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.680
Mr Temple has a prior engagement.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.760
Accompany him to the street.
The back exit.

34:03.160 --> 34:06.400
Victor...

34:06.440 --> 34:09.159
did you speak with your backer?
Yes, i did.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.840
And...? You weren't going to take
no for an answer. What did she say?

34:13.880 --> 34:15.880
She said no.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.320
Oh. Well, you've got to laugh.

34:19.360 --> 34:23.719
I hope it doesn't put you off.
You've got great... spirit.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.960
You'll find another backer. I have every belief in you.
That's what keeps me going.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.080
Peas in a pod, the two of us.
We can do things for ourselves.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.080
We don't need anyone else to...

34:33.120 --> 34:36.440
Perhaps you allow Mr Colleano
to attend his business.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.120
I have yet to be offered any form
of refreshment.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.040
Champagne, Lady Loxley?
Yes.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.760
That would be appropriate to
celebrate our new business venture.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.760
How do you mean?
I'll see Lord Loxley tomorrow

34:54.800 --> 34:57.720
about acquiring the finance
for your restaurant.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.200
Even if it means i have to endure
a visit to the ghastly country.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.080
What made you change your mind?

35:04.120 --> 35:06.920
All that need concern you

35:06.960 --> 35:09.720
is that you remember
that you will be in my debt.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.920
I hope i make my self clear.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.080
So, you see, dear heart...

35:18.120 --> 35:20.760
I do believe in you after all.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.640
You don't believe in me.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.760
You believe in getting your own way.

35:31.640 --> 35:35.040
So, i reckon, that'll be a thanks,
Lady Loxely...

35:35.080 --> 35:37.080
but no, thanks.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.080
I'll get your champagne.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.720
The sense of loneliness
in a place like that...

35:55.760 --> 35:57.760
it must be extreme, don't you think?

35:59.240 --> 36:05.440
You don't need to go to Antarctica to experience loneliness,
Miss Ravillious. How right you are.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.520
It can be a difficult lot
for us women.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.320
If you don't find the right man,
you work forever.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.840
If you do find the right man,
you can't work.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.160
So unfair when you consider
how capable we are, Miss Mardle.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.080
Don't you think?

36:19.120 --> 36:21.240
You're quite right, Miss Ravillious.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.280
It's why i joined the Suffragettes.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.920
Seems to me,
it's really about justice,

36:29.960 --> 36:32.920
but it's also about women
being there for one another.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.040
That way, one don't have to face
whatever the future holds,

36:36.080 --> 36:38.080
entirely on one's own.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.360
Do you know,
I'd never thought of it like that.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.120
You're welcome to attend a weekly meeting with me,
if you'd like, Miss Mardle.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.480
I think i'd like that very much,
Miss Ravillious. Thank you.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Ernest Shackleton.

37:12.160 --> 37:16.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me tell you about 'cold'.

37:17.160 --> 37:21.960
A cold so cold, it's hot.

37:23.400 --> 37:28.000
There we stood,
the furthest South ever.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.000
A mere 97 miles
from the South Pole.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.560
But we were nearly out of food.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.200
And i had to make a choice...

37:37.240 --> 37:40.760
between epic success -
the conquering of the South Pole -

37:40.800 --> 37:45.000
but with undoubted loss of life
amongst my men.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.440
Or epic failure.

37:49.480 --> 37:53.120
Well, as you know, i chose epic
failure and received a knighthood.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.920
Because that's the kind
of country we are.

37:59.520 --> 38:03.640
We don't always measure
in terms of success,

38:03.680 --> 38:05.920
but in how hard a man has tried.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.760
And so we turned for home,

38:12.800 --> 38:15.520
and the bitter struggle
to retrace our steps.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.240
Only the thoughts of our loved ones
to keep us going.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.400
Home - so, so far away.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.680
Bravo!
Bravo. Bravo!

38:52.960 --> 38:54.960
Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.400
Thank you, Ernest. I think we all learned something
from your fine lecture.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.160
Well, it was a pleasure, Harry.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.600
I've been thinking
about your question, young man.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.840
I think my real purpose as leader
was quite simple...

39:07.880 --> 39:11.880
to bring my men in from the cold,
each and every day.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.360
If you remember that, Master Gordon,
I think you'll fit nicely

39:15.400 --> 39:18.160
into your father's
rather large footsteps.

39:18.200 --> 39:23.280
Thank you. Crabb, get me all the Heads of Departments
in my office in five minutes.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.320
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.040
Mr Shackleton, sir?

40:23.040 --> 40:25.000
"I take with me the happiest memories

40:25.040 --> 40:28.480
of my time
in the Selfridge work family.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.960
Please tell everybody
not to be sad for me.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.440
I've simply moved on to the place
that seems right -

40:34.480 --> 40:37.840
to be with the person i loved
most in the world.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.040
My dear mother.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.760
Yours sincerely, Miss Flora Bunting."

40:47.240 --> 40:49.800
I let one of our own
out into the cold.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.080
This can never happen again.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.440
Thank you, all. Safe journey home.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.040
Good night, Mr Selfridge.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
Well said, Mr Selfridge.
Thank you.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
Thank you, Mr Grove.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.040
To Miss Bunting.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.040
To Miss Bunting.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.320
That's what i thought, Mr Grove.
You are absolutely right, Doris.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.360
A lovely way of looking at it.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.800
Thank you, Fraser.
Thank you, Fraser.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.160
Didn't it just make you want
to visit Antarctica?

42:20.640 --> 42:24.600
Rose, i'm going to commission
another portrait of you.

42:24.640 --> 42:27.480
I don't think Mr Temple
captured you properly.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.640
I don't think i care
for another portrait.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.920
Thank you anyway.
Rose?

42:38.120 --> 42:40.120
He says you're in love with him.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.360
Believe what you want to believe,
Harry.

42:55.520 --> 42:58.760
Tell Mrs Selfridge i've gone out.
Thank you and good night.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.840
Somone special
wants to visit Selfridge's.

43:46.880 --> 43:49.440
You know i'm not keen
on granting special favours.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.560
You might change your mind
when you find out who my friend is.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.920
Kitty Hawkins?
You think i might have a chance?

43:54.960 --> 43:57.680
If you don't ask, you'll never know.
May i have this dance?

43:57.720 --> 44:01.520
You borrow Miss Towler so often, i'm
afraid you think she's your property.

44:01.560 --> 44:04.520
She's engaged, Miss Mardle!
You're not going to like the play.

44:04.560 --> 44:09.200
Oh, come on, of course i will! You're really asking me 
to go and see your mistress in a play?

44:09.360 --> 44:44.000
