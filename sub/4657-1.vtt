02:21.624 --> 02:23.922
Best ketchup we ever made, Katie.

02:26.362 --> 02:28.626
- Too sweet.
- Mr. Smith likes it sweet.

02:28.798 --> 02:32.325
All men like it on the sweet side.
Too sweet, Mrs. Smith.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.803
Hello.

02:43.479 --> 02:45.640
- Too flat.
- You can always put spice in...

02:45.815 --> 02:48.613
...but you can't take it out.
That just came for you.

02:48.785 --> 02:50.685
- Did you get everything?
- Everything.

02:50.854 --> 02:54.255
It's my Princeton catalog.
I've been waiting for this.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.824
Boy, Mama, you should've
taken a swim with me.

02:56.993 --> 02:58.927
That's all I have to do.

03:00.697 --> 03:03.029
- Don't track up the floor, now.
- I won't.

03:30.827 --> 03:34.058
- I'll be out in a minute, Agnes.
- All right, Grandpa.

04:27.216 --> 04:28.911
That was a good ride.

04:30.153 --> 04:33.520
So long, Esther.
We'll see you later. Bye.

04:36.926 --> 04:39.224
Certainly was hot on the tennis court.

04:39.395 --> 04:42.262
Too hot, if you ask me.
Don't forget to wash your hair.

04:42.432 --> 04:45.492
I won't. Rose is bringing
shampoo from downtown.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.401
- Too sour?
- Just what I told Katie.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.871
Is it all right?

05:04.620 --> 05:09.023
Would it start a minor revolution in this
house if dinner was an hour early tonight?

05:09.192 --> 05:11.353
Mr. Smith hates
to eat early on a hot day.

05:11.561 --> 05:15.258
It gives you more time to digest
your food before retiring.

05:15.431 --> 05:19.197
Besides, I'm due at my sister's
house 7:00 on a family matter.

05:19.369 --> 05:21.963
- Something wrong?
- Trouble with her husband...

05:22.138 --> 05:23.469
...him being a man.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.369
It's all right with me.
You explain it to Mr. Smith.

05:26.542 --> 05:30.638
Oh, he won't mind, seeing
as how tonight's corned-beef night.

05:33.316 --> 05:36.945
- Is it all right, Katie?
- Yes, but I had to tell your mother lies.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.179
- They're white lies.
- A lie is a lie.

05:39.355 --> 05:43.724
Dressing it in white don't help it.
Now, if it's not asking too...

05:44.027 --> 05:48.293
Just why was I lying this time?
Why must we have dinner an hour early?

05:48.464 --> 05:51.126
- Rose is expecting...
- Don't blame your sister.

05:51.300 --> 05:55.327
Blaming her? We're doing this for her.
You know Rose's problem.

05:55.805 --> 05:58.205
Warren's been writing
to her for six months...

05:58.374 --> 06:00.865
...without one word
that smells like a proposal.

06:01.044 --> 06:04.070
What's that got to do
with having dinner an hour early?

06:04.247 --> 06:07.978
Warren Sheffield is telephoning
Rose long-distance at half past 6.

06:08.151 --> 06:10.016
- Long-distance?
- From New York City.

06:10.186 --> 06:13.053
If the family's sitting here,
she'll be loath to say...

06:13.222 --> 06:16.282
...what she's compelled to,
to get a proposal out of a man.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.654
If he, unfortunately,
is Warren Sheffield.

06:18.828 --> 06:22.525
Personally, I wouldn't marry a man
who proposed to me over an invention.

06:22.698 --> 06:25.724
Well, we can't be too particular.
Although we love Rose...

06:25.902 --> 06:27.893
...the brutal fact is that...

06:28.071 --> 06:31.370
...well, she isn't getting any younger.
- Hello, Rose.

06:31.541 --> 06:33.668
There's the poor old maid now.

06:56.399 --> 06:59.300
Esther. Esther! He's out there.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.437
- John Truett?
- On the porch.

07:02.738 --> 07:07.368
Now, be perfectly calm. We have the
perfect right to sit on our own front porch.

07:10.680 --> 07:16.585
- Isn't it a lovely day, Esther, dear?
- Heavenly, Rose. Simply heavenly.

07:32.668 --> 07:36.866
Well! He's not very neighborly,
I must say.

07:39.308 --> 07:43.802
He's only lived here three weeks. You
can't expect him to fling himself at you.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.280
Well, that's true. Besides, meeting across
the lawn for the first time would be...

07:48.451 --> 07:51.818
...so ordinary. I don't want
to be just introduced to him.

07:51.988 --> 07:56.982
I want it to be something strange and
wonderful, something I'll always remember.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.095
I'll get George to bring him
to Lon's going-away party.

08:00.263 --> 08:01.560
Could you?

08:01.864 --> 08:03.798
Rose. Esther.
The water's hot.

08:03.966 --> 08:06.491
You should wash your hair.
We're eating early.

08:06.769 --> 08:09.397
All right, Mother.
Why are we eating early?

08:09.572 --> 08:14.509
You certainly don't want the family in there
while a man proposes long-distance.

08:14.677 --> 08:19.205
Proposes? I don't see why you assume
Warren's gonna propose to me.

08:19.382 --> 08:22.579
Well, why else do you think
he's calling you long-distance?

08:22.752 --> 08:26.279
- Do you know what it costs?
- I'm not even sure I'll be in.

08:26.989 --> 08:28.616
When you get to be my age...

08:28.791 --> 08:32.625
...you'll find out there are more
important things in life than boys.

12:11.847 --> 12:13.712
Too sweet?

12:14.350 --> 12:16.079
Too sour?

12:20.055 --> 12:23.354
- Too thick.
- Oh, Grandpa!

12:24.360 --> 12:27.261
Katie, where's my cat?
Where is she?

12:27.430 --> 12:31.025
I don't know. She got in the way,
I kicked her down the cellar steps.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.260
I could hear her spine hit
on every step.

12:34.437 --> 12:36.462
If you've killed her, I'll kill you.

12:36.639 --> 12:40.131
I'll stab you to death in your sleep,
and tie you to wild horses...

12:40.309 --> 12:44.143
...until you're pulled apart.
- Won't that be terrible? There's your cat.

12:44.313 --> 12:49.012
- Oh, poor Lady Babbie.
- Don't go away. We're eating early.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.244
I can't get hungry till it gets dark.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.888
Dinner's at 5:30.
You can eat blindfolded.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.752
We have to be out
of the dining room by 6:30.

12:56.926 --> 13:00.657
Warren Sheffield is telephoning
Rose long-distance from New York.

13:02.264 --> 13:04.858
Rose, I wouldn't commit
myself one way or another.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.862
- After all...
- For goodness' sake.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.472
We know very little about him.
We haven't even met his folks.

13:10.639 --> 13:12.163
It seems to me...

13:12.341 --> 13:16.607
It seems to me that one little phone call
is causing an awful lot of excitement.

13:16.779 --> 13:20.806
Besides, you're entirely too young.
I don't think your father would allow it.

13:21.484 --> 13:24.453
If I keep lying for your daughters,
I'll need more money.

13:24.620 --> 13:28.386
Not a word of this to Papa.
He plagues the girls about their beaus.

13:28.557 --> 13:32.323
- Everybody knows but Papa?
- Your papa's not supposed to know.

13:32.495 --> 13:36.864
It's enough that we're letting him
work hard to support the flock of us.

13:37.032 --> 13:38.761
He can't have everything.

13:42.938 --> 13:45.236
Where's Tootie?
I haven't seen her all day.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.342
- Did Tootie come home with you?
- No, Mama.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.206
Oh, I suppose she's working
on the ice wagon.

14:04.293 --> 14:07.228
Who gets ice now, Mr. Neely?

14:07.396 --> 14:10.126
Oh, Mr. Neely!

14:10.599 --> 14:13.363
- Who gets ice now, Mr. Neely?
- No one, Tootie.

14:13.536 --> 14:18.473
Robin just can't seem to remember Mrs.
Wilkins moved. Now, you get out of there.

14:19.241 --> 14:22.677
Poor Margaretha.
Never seen her look so pale.

14:22.845 --> 14:25.211
Well, sun ought to do her some good.

14:25.381 --> 14:30.717
I expect she won't live through
the night. She has four fatal diseases.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.178
And it only takes one.

14:33.756 --> 14:38.693
But she's gonna have a beautiful funeral
in a cigar box my papa gave me...

14:38.861 --> 14:41.489
...all wrapped in silver paper.

14:42.197 --> 14:44.722
That's the way to go if you have to go.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.261
Oh, she has to go.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.696
Mr. Neely, is Robin a girl horse
or a boy horse?

14:50.873 --> 14:53.171
- Girl.
- How old is she?

14:53.342 --> 14:58.405
- Four.
- She's awful big for 4. I'm 5.

14:58.581 --> 15:02.517
- Is she strong?
- Strongest ice horse in St. Louis.

15:03.018 --> 15:06.476
Excuse me, Mr. Neely,
but it's pronounced St. "Louis."

15:06.655 --> 15:12.491
Is it, now? I've got a cousin spells
it the same way, and we call him Louie.

15:12.661 --> 15:16.062
- He's not a city, though, is he?
- No.

15:16.231 --> 15:19.291
- Is he a saint?
- No.

15:19.702 --> 15:24.662
- Then there's no comparison.
- Well, anyway, she's a grand old town.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.470
It isn't a town, Mr. Neely. It's a city.
It's the only city that has a world's fair.

15:29.645 --> 15:34.548
My favorite. Wasn't I lucky
to be born in my favorite city?

16:40.783 --> 16:43.013
For heaven's sake,
stop that screeching.

16:43.786 --> 16:46.220
We're sorry, Papa.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.293
That song. The fair
won't open for seven months.

16:53.462 --> 16:55.953
That's all everybody sings
about or talks about.

16:56.131 --> 16:59.692
I wish everybody would meet
at the fair and leave me alone.

16:59.868 --> 17:03.770
Hello, dearest.
Did you have a nice day?

17:03.939 --> 17:07.807
- I lost the case.
- I'm sorry. You were so sure you'd win it.

17:07.976 --> 17:10.637
I overlooked one thing.
That judge is an old thief.

17:10.813 --> 17:13.873
If losing a case depresses you,
quit practicing law...

17:14.049 --> 17:16.313
...and go into another line of business.

17:17.519 --> 17:18.952
That's a good idea.

17:19.121 --> 17:23.182
Beginning tomorrow, I intend to play
at first base for the Baltimore Orioles.

17:24.259 --> 17:26.989
- Sorry if I was bombastic.
- That's all right.

17:27.162 --> 17:31.064
- You'll feel better when you have dinner.
- I suppose so.

17:31.233 --> 17:35.761
But right now I'm going to soak
in that cool bathtub for one solid hour.

17:35.938 --> 17:39.237
But that's impossible.
Dinner's being served in five minutes.

17:39.541 --> 17:40.974
Five minutes?

17:42.945 --> 17:47.473
- It's only 5:25, not 6:25.
- We're eating an hour earlier tonight.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.517
- The plans have changed. I'm taking a bath.
- We're eating early for Katie.

17:51.687 --> 17:54.485
Family trouble.
She wants to go there when we finish.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.147
- Her sister's fighting with her husband.
- I see.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.762
- And they'll stop if I don't bathe.
- Katie's been here 10 years.

18:00.929 --> 18:03.363
She never asks favors.
We don't wanna lose her.

18:03.532 --> 18:06.228
You can't get a maid
for less than $ 12 a month.

18:06.401 --> 18:09.029
Lon, count three.

18:09.938 --> 18:12.099
One, two, three.

18:12.274 --> 18:16.643
I don't care if we have to pay a maid
$ 15 a month. Dinner will be at 6:30.

18:16.812 --> 18:20.771
If Katie wants to hand in her notice,
she can reach me in the bathtub!

18:29.958 --> 18:32.825
It's way after 6:30,
and Warren hasn't called yet.

18:32.995 --> 18:36.328
- Maybe he got himself another girl.
- Quiet, you two.

18:37.166 --> 18:40.602
I'm not the slightest bit sensitive
about Warren Sheffield.

18:40.769 --> 18:43.829
- The queen has spoken.
- I suppose Warren's too young too.

18:44.006 --> 18:47.373
- Everyone I introduce her to is too young.
- Now, listen.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.639
Your father will be down in a minute. If we
eat quickly, we may get him out...

18:51.814 --> 18:55.910
...before the call comes through.
- Warren's 21. I think that's a perfect age.

18:56.084 --> 18:59.110
- Practically a child.
- Your father was 20 when we married.

18:59.288 --> 19:04.351
We gave him a bachelor dinner the night
before. He almost missed the wedding.

19:05.861 --> 19:07.795
The lord and master.

19:14.136 --> 19:17.230
Now I remember where I left
my other skate.

19:25.714 --> 19:27.773
I hope I haven't held you up.

19:28.150 --> 19:31.347
- I was just taking a little ride before dinner.
- Hello, Papa.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.489
I buried Maude Rockefeller today.
You missed all the fun.

19:34.656 --> 19:38.217
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I've had a pretty full day.

19:38.393 --> 19:41.021
Tootie, remind me
to spank you right after dinner.

19:41.196 --> 19:43.187
Okay, Papa.

19:43.665 --> 19:47.726
Lord, we thank you for the bountiful
blessings we are about to receive. Amen.

19:59.481 --> 20:02.678
- Lf I forget to remind Papa, you remind me.
- All right.

20:02.851 --> 20:05.012
Katie, this is delicious.

20:08.357 --> 20:13.420
Well, I guess this hasn't been exactly
a red-letter day for any of us.

20:13.595 --> 20:18.532
Now, suppose we all relax
and enjoy a nice, leisurely meal.

20:21.236 --> 20:23.727
Katie, I'm sorry
I couldn't eat an hour early.

20:23.906 --> 20:26.773
Don't blame me if the
corned beef's an hour tougher.

20:26.942 --> 20:30.434
You finished already, Tootie?
That's the way I like to see you eat.

20:30.612 --> 20:33.410
You'll be a big girl if...

20:34.683 --> 20:37.277
Either I've lost some soup,
or I've found a spoon.

20:37.452 --> 20:40.182
- Oh, Katie.
- Lonnie, did you have a nice day...

20:40.355 --> 20:42.323
Oh, no, you didn't, did you, dear?

20:42.891 --> 20:46.486
There's a fashion pavilion
at the world's fair. Isn't that exciting?

20:46.662 --> 20:50.393
We have to wait six months for it to open.
I'll die. I'll simply die!

20:51.733 --> 20:53.166
Anybody want dessert?

20:53.335 --> 20:56.327
- What happened to dinner?
- I didn't think anyone could eat meat...

20:56.505 --> 20:58.632
...on a hot day like this.
- I'm not hot.

20:58.807 --> 21:01.640
I had a cool bath,
which nobody can take away from me.

21:01.810 --> 21:04.836
I have every intention
of eating an enormous dinner!

21:06.348 --> 21:09.215
Anna, I think Katie's getting a little old.

21:09.384 --> 21:11.716
Her mental processes baffle me.

21:14.589 --> 21:17.057
Ah, corned beef and cabbage.

21:17.225 --> 21:20.092
I could smell that cabbage
when I got off the trolley.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.696
Cabbage has a cabbage smell.

21:27.169 --> 21:31.333
In this house, we cut the corned beef.
We don't shave it. Where's the knife?

21:31.506 --> 21:34.805
Mrs. Smith, you said you wanted
to make this go for two meals.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.511
I'll take it.

21:49.157 --> 21:50.522
Hello.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.657
What?

21:53.695 --> 21:58.132
You'll have to speak louder, please.
New York?

21:58.300 --> 22:02.236
No, I'm not calling New York.
Hello.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.497
Hello.

22:07.209 --> 22:09.200
- I'm taking that phone out.
- Alono.

22:09.378 --> 22:12.745
- Yes, Anna?
- Every telephone call isn't for you.

22:14.149 --> 22:15.776
That one wasn't.

22:16.051 --> 22:17.882
Those operators!

22:18.754 --> 22:21.621
Katie, take this out in the kitchen
and slice it.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.522
Rose is crying.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.196
What's the matter with you?

22:28.997 --> 22:33.934
Oh, nothing, Papa. You've just ruined
Rose's chance to get married, that's all.

22:34.903 --> 22:36.165
What?

22:36.338 --> 22:39.364
That was Warren Sheffield
calling long-distance to propose.

22:41.309 --> 22:43.174
Oh, I see.

22:53.121 --> 22:57.751
Tootie, did you know a long-distance
phone call was coming to this house?

22:57.926 --> 23:01.692
The ice man saw a drunkard get shot.
The blood spurted out 3 feet.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.660
Answer yes or no.

23:06.401 --> 23:09.302
- Yes, sir.
- Agnes?

23:10.172 --> 23:11.833
Yes, sir.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.373
- Lon?
- Yes, sir.

23:17.746 --> 23:20.374
Well, that's just fine.

23:22.884 --> 23:25.284
Anna, I'm curious.

23:25.454 --> 23:27.718
Just when was I voted out of this family?

23:28.090 --> 23:31.218
- Oh, Lon, really, now.
- What else am I to think?

23:31.393 --> 23:34.191
My eldest daughter is practically
on her honeymoon...

23:34.362 --> 23:36.489
...and everybody knows about it but me.

23:39.267 --> 23:44.603
In view of the fact that this family refuses
to let me in on their little intrigues...

23:44.773 --> 23:47.264
...I'll handle the telephone
in my own way.

23:47.442 --> 23:50.434
From now on,
I'll take all incoming calls.

23:54.249 --> 23:57.616
- Rose, you answer that.
- Thank you, Papa.

23:59.588 --> 24:00.714
Hello.

24:01.756 --> 24:06.420
Yes, this is Miss Rose Smith.
Yes, you may put that New York call on.

24:10.031 --> 24:14.468
Hello, Warren.
Yes, I'm fine. How are you?

24:14.636 --> 24:17.366
Oh, I'm fine, Rose.
How's St. Louis?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.565
- What did you say?
- I said, how's St. Louis?

24:20.742 --> 24:24.109
- Oh, St. Louis is fine.
- Is it hot there?

24:24.279 --> 24:27.214
Yes, it's very hot.
It's as hot as July.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.783
- Is it hot there?
- Yes, it's hot here too.

24:30.952 --> 24:33.853
I'm calling from a booth
in the Hotel Delmonico.

24:34.022 --> 24:38.288
- Can you hear me all right?
- Yes, I can hear you fine.

24:42.864 --> 24:45.526
- What did you say, Warren?
- Nothing.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.191
I was waiting for you to talk.

24:50.205 --> 24:54.733
Well, did you want to discuss
anything in particular?

24:54.910 --> 24:56.537
What?

24:56.711 --> 25:01.444
I said, was there anything special
you wanted to ask me?

25:01.616 --> 25:06.849
- I can't hear you, Rose.
- That's funny. I can hear you plainly.

25:07.522 --> 25:11.754
Isn't this great? Here I am in New York,
and there you are in St. Louis...

25:11.927 --> 25:14.191
...and it's like you're in the next room.

25:14.362 --> 25:18.230
- What was that?
- I said it's just like you're in the next room!

25:19.034 --> 25:23.494
Say, Rose, I hope you won't
misunderstand what I'm going to say.

25:23.672 --> 25:25.196
Yes?

25:26.341 --> 25:29.572
I don't think you better
mention this call to anyone.

25:29.744 --> 25:31.234
Why not?

25:31.413 --> 25:35.543
Because there'd be "h" to pay if my
family knew I called long-distance.

25:35.717 --> 25:38.515
- What did you say?
- He said there'd be...

25:38.687 --> 25:41.747
- "h" to pay if my family
found out I called long-distance!

25:41.923 --> 25:46.326
That's strange. My family's home,
and they don't think anything of it.

25:46.494 --> 25:49.429
Well, I better not waste any more
of your time and money.

25:49.598 --> 25:55.127
- Wait, Rose. We've still got... 36 seconds.
- I have an engagement.

25:55.303 --> 25:58.067
I think I can hear Joe's voice now.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.764
Good evening, Joe.

26:00.508 --> 26:04.706
- I was gonna write you tonight.
- You can write to me tonight if you want.

26:04.879 --> 26:07.074
I'll write you right after I hang up.

26:07.249 --> 26:09.581
Yes, do that little thing.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.731
- Lon...
- I beg your pardon...

26:33.441 --> 26:39.038
I'll bet there isn't another girl in St. Louis
who's had a Yale man call long-distance...

26:39.214 --> 26:42.149
...just to inquire about her health.
- I should say not.

26:42.317 --> 26:45.218
I've figured out a new move in chess.

26:47.355 --> 26:50.984
I'd like a slice of corned beef.
I thought you were mad at me.

26:51.159 --> 26:53.423
I couldn't be mad at you, Mr. Smith.

27:07.575 --> 27:10.840
- Es, he's here.
- What did he say?

27:11.012 --> 27:14.448
Nothing concrete,
but his voice is wonderful.

27:16.751 --> 27:20.243
- It would've been nice to be a brunette.
- You should've been.

27:20.422 --> 27:23.983
Nothing could've stopped us.
Think how we'd look going out together.

27:24.192 --> 27:28.094
You with your raven black hair
and me with my auburn.

27:28.263 --> 27:31.699
Rose, I've decided something.

27:31.866 --> 27:34.994
- I'm going to let John kiss me tonight.
- Esther Smith!

27:35.170 --> 27:37.468
If we're getting married,
I should start it.

27:37.639 --> 27:41.370
Nice girls don't let men kiss them
until after they're engaged.

27:41.543 --> 27:44.535
Men don't want the bloom rubbed off.

27:44.946 --> 27:47.744
Personally, I think I have
too much bloom.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.044
Maybe that's the trouble with me.

28:27.689 --> 28:31.989
Eve, it's been ages! And you
brought your violin. How nice.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.823
Harry, how are you?
How nice of you to come.

28:35.997 --> 28:38.090
Really, I'm so glad.

28:41.569 --> 28:44.936
Yes, sir, Princeton's a peach
of a school. A peach of a school.

28:45.106 --> 28:46.903
- Oh, Es.
- Yes, Alono?

28:47.075 --> 28:52.274
- May I present our neighbor, John Truett?
- I didn't quite catch the name.

28:52.447 --> 28:55.814
- John Truett.
- Welcome to our home, Mr. Truett.

28:55.984 --> 29:01.081
Well, thank you. This is the first party
I've been to since we moved to St. Louis.

29:01.256 --> 29:04.714
- Oh, do you live here?
- He lives next door.

29:04.893 --> 29:07.919
Oh, well, that's where I've seen you.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.533
Corner boy, buck and wing
corner girl!

31:05.747 --> 31:08.341
Ida Boothby to the center and whirl!

31:10.785 --> 31:12.810
Everybody dance!

32:14.749 --> 32:20.551
Miss Esther. Miss Esther.
There are mice in the house. Two of them.

32:22.323 --> 32:24.314
Tootie and Agnes!

32:26.661 --> 32:30.188
- Oh, aren't they cute?
- Oh, how cute.

32:32.333 --> 32:35.791
- Why aren't you two asleep?
- There was too much noise down here.

32:35.970 --> 32:40.304
- I want to sing too.
- One song, all right, Rose?

32:40.475 --> 32:45.071
- Well, if they promise to go right up.
- Come on. You're so bad.

32:47.515 --> 32:50.382
- Come on, Lon.
- Oh, there we go.

32:50.551 --> 32:54.078
- Agnes, that's enough fudge.
- Tootie sings quite well for a child.

32:54.255 --> 32:57.315
What would you like to sing?
"Baby's Boats," "A Silver Moon"...

32:57.492 --> 32:59.926
...or "Did You Ever See
a Rabbit Climb a Tree?"

33:00.094 --> 33:03.154
No. I hate those songs. I want
to sing a new one.

33:03.331 --> 33:08.291
It goes:
I was "hmm" last night, dear Mother

33:09.037 --> 33:12.529
- You can't sing that.
- Do let her. She's such a sweet little thing.

33:12.707 --> 33:14.140
Sweet? She's a hoodlum.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.640
- Oh, come on. Let her sing.
- Let her sing.

33:16.811 --> 33:18.244
Well, all right.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.677
Go on.
Go on, Tootie.

33:20.848 --> 33:24.944
I was drunk last night, dear Mother

33:25.119 --> 33:28.520
I was drunk the night before

33:28.690 --> 33:31.557
But if you'll forgive me, Mother

33:31.726 --> 33:34.889
I'll never get drunk anymore

33:36.130 --> 33:40.328
You're a very bad girl. It's really Lon's fault.
He teaches her those things.

33:40.635 --> 33:43.001
I can do the cakewalk
if Esther does it too.

33:43.171 --> 33:45.105
- No!
- Oh, come on, Esther, do it!

33:45.273 --> 33:47.707
Oh, all right. Anything.

33:48.810 --> 33:52.371
Now that you've insisted on doing this,
you better be good.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.111
- Too big.
- Yes, I know. Well, here, try this one.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.310
Now, put them on the chair.

34:01.556 --> 34:04.889
- A verse and two choruses.
- Oh, Es. Want an introduction?

34:05.059 --> 34:06.993
Yes, the long one.

34:11.733 --> 34:13.530
You're supposed to be over there.

34:13.701 --> 34:17.068
- Oh, I want this side.
- Oh, all right. Stay over there.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.630
Now.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.352
Vamp.

36:14.121 --> 36:16.316
- I'm gonna walk Eve home.
- Thank you.

36:16.490 --> 36:20.551
- Good night, Eve. You played beautifully.
- Thank you.

36:20.728 --> 36:23.595
I can't find my hat anywhere, darn it.

36:23.764 --> 36:27.222
- Oh, pardon the expression.
- Your hat? Why...

36:27.401 --> 36:30.666
I put it here with the others
when you came in.

36:30.838 --> 36:35.207
Oh, Es, have you seen
Mr. Truett's chapeau?

36:36.477 --> 36:40.709
It seems I saw it somewhere.
I...

36:42.550 --> 36:44.950
Excuse me just a minute.

36:55.696 --> 36:58.358
Sorry to detain you.
It was right where I left it.

36:58.532 --> 36:59.829
Thank you.

37:00.001 --> 37:02.902
- Good night, Miss Rose.
- Good night, Mr. Truett.

37:03.070 --> 37:05.300
- Good night, Miss Esther.
- Good night.

37:05.473 --> 37:09.170
And thank you
for your neighborly hospitality.

37:10.544 --> 37:12.034
Raisins.

37:12.213 --> 37:16.149
- I wonder how those got there.
- That's funny, isn't it?

37:16.317 --> 37:19.912
- Bon soir, Mr. Truett. Coming up, Es?
- Presently.

37:20.087 --> 37:22.851
After all, someone has to show
our guest to the door.

37:23.024 --> 37:27.859
Remember, Es, dear,
you have to get your beauty sleep.

37:30.965 --> 37:35.163
- Well, I guess I better get going.
- You haven't very far to go.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.930
No, I haven't at that, have I?

37:38.105 --> 37:39.470
Well, good night.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.870
We'll be seeing some more of you,
won't we?

37:42.043 --> 37:43.567
You bet.

37:43.744 --> 37:46.975
You'll join the crowd Friday
to go to the fairgrounds, won't you?

37:47.148 --> 37:51.244
- Lf basketball practice doesn't run too late.
- Yes.

37:51.619 --> 37:54.213
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

37:56.257 --> 37:59.749
That Welsh rabbit was ginger peachy.

38:00.661 --> 38:03.027
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.258
- Mr. Truett?
- Yes, Miss Esther?

38:08.602 --> 38:11.366
This is an untoward request, but...

38:11.539 --> 38:15.737
...will you mind accompanying me through
the house while I turn out the lights?

38:16.577 --> 38:19.444
- Well, l...
- It's just that I...

38:19.613 --> 38:21.638
I'm afraid of mice.

38:21.816 --> 38:24.080
Well, sure, sure.

38:25.453 --> 38:29.947
That's the least a man can do
for his charming hostess.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.651
I have to turn them out everywhere.

38:32.827 --> 38:36.923
In the dining room,
and in the living room, and everywhere.

38:52.046 --> 38:54.412
- Would you?
- Sure.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.785
No, it's here.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.564
Well, it certainly is dark in here
with the lights off.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.965
It certainly is.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.006
- Shall we do the dining room next?
- Yes.

40:05.019 --> 40:07.351
Say, that is nice perfume.

40:07.521 --> 40:09.284
Do you like it?

40:10.424 --> 40:15.828
It's essence of violet.
I save it for special occasions.

40:15.996 --> 40:19.727
Exactly the kind my grandmother uses.

40:43.090 --> 40:46.457
No, this one is different,
you have to...

40:51.465 --> 40:54.798
- There.
- I'll turn these last two out.

40:54.969 --> 40:58.837
Hadn't you better leave those lights on
for your folks?

40:59.006 --> 41:01.497
I'll just turn them down dim.

41:21.929 --> 41:24.261
Gosh, Miss Esther.

41:24.532 --> 41:27.899
I hope I'm not too presumptuous.

41:28.836 --> 41:31.270
You don't need any beauty sleep.

41:32.039 --> 41:34.200
What a nice compliment.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.900
- How does it go?
- How does what go?

41:38.379 --> 41:42.315
"Over the banister leans a face...

41:42.483 --> 41:45.748
...tenderly sweet...

41:46.253 --> 41:48.517
...and, and..."

43:03.631 --> 43:06.896
Gosh, that's beautiful, Miss Esther.

43:07.067 --> 43:09.661
You can drop the "Miss."

43:10.671 --> 43:14.198
This has been a great evening.
Really, it has.

43:14.375 --> 43:17.538
- I'll never forget it, Esther.
- Do you mean that?

43:17.711 --> 43:20.578
Yes, yes, I do.
And you know something else?

43:20.748 --> 43:22.238
What?

43:22.683 --> 43:25.846
You've got a mighty strong grip
for a girl.

43:29.456 --> 43:31.014
Good night...

43:31.325 --> 43:32.587
...Esther.

43:34.094 --> 43:35.823
Good night...

43:36.297 --> 43:37.787
...neighbor.

43:53.813 --> 43:56.213
Hey! You boys, stop that!

43:56.382 --> 43:58.873
Leave that trolley alone!

44:03.089 --> 44:06.286
It's gonna be the biggest fair ever.
My father was talking...

44:06.459 --> 44:10.395
...to the world's-fair commission, and
they estimate it'll cost 50 million.

44:10.563 --> 44:14.260
- That's a lot of kale.
- I can hardly wait to see Skinker's Swamp.

44:14.434 --> 44:18.928
- Yes, it must look like a fairyland!
- Oh, now, wait. It's still a little rough.

44:19.105 --> 44:22.006
After all, the exposition doesn't open
for six months.

44:22.175 --> 44:25.235
Here we go.
All aboard, everybody!

44:28.481 --> 44:30.472
Hurry it along.
We haven't got all day.

44:30.650 --> 44:34.177
Up in front, please.
Move up, there's plenty of room.

44:34.353 --> 44:36.412
Quentin, are we...?

44:36.589 --> 44:39.422
- Are we all here?
- Just too bad for those that aren't.

44:39.592 --> 44:43.392
Time, tide and trolley wait for no man.
Let her go, motorman.

45:55.802 --> 45:58.566
Hey! Look who's coming!

47:22.221 --> 47:23.518
Hiya, Johnny!

49:17.303 --> 49:21.330
You be careful and don't run over
Mrs. Truett's lawn. It's just been planted.

49:21.507 --> 49:23.532
We won't.
She's nice.

49:23.709 --> 49:26.405
But wait'll you see what we do
to Mr. Braukoff.

49:26.579 --> 49:30.140
- That'll be a caution, won't it, Tootie?
- We'll fix him fine.

49:30.316 --> 49:32.944
It'll serve him right for poisoning cats.

49:33.119 --> 49:34.677
Does he poison cats?

49:35.287 --> 49:39.986
He buys meat, and then he buys poison,
and then he puts them all together.

49:40.159 --> 49:44.220
Then he burns the cats at midnight
in his furnace. You can smell the smoke.

49:44.864 --> 49:47.662
That's horrible.
Are you sure?

49:47.833 --> 49:50.631
Johnny Tevis smelled smoke
and peeked in the window...

49:50.803 --> 49:53.601
...and there was a box of dead cats.

49:53.773 --> 49:58.039
And Mr. Braukoff was beating his wife
with a red-hot poker.

49:58.210 --> 50:02.647
I never would have believed it.
He looks like such a quiet man.

50:03.749 --> 50:05.979
- And you know something else?
- Don't tell!

50:06.152 --> 50:10.282
- You crossed your heart you wouldn't tell.
- I crossed it with my left hand.

50:10.456 --> 50:16.588
Mr. Braukoff has empty whiskey bottles
in his cellar.

50:23.602 --> 50:25.092
- Boo!
- Boo!

50:25.271 --> 50:28.206
Mrs. Smith, who are these boys?

50:28.374 --> 50:30.274
It's me, Katie. It's Agnes.

50:30.443 --> 50:34.539
The saints preserve us, it is!
You had me fooled.

50:35.147 --> 50:36.842
Mama, we fooled her!

50:37.016 --> 50:40.213
Well, if you can fool Katie,
you can fool anyone.

50:40.653 --> 50:44.350
- I'll answer it, Mama.
- I thought you were a drunken ghost.

50:44.523 --> 50:48.789
Well, I am. She's a horrible ghost,
and I'm a terrible drunken ghost.

50:48.961 --> 50:53.159
She was murdered in a den of thieves,
and I died of a broken heart.

50:53.332 --> 50:57.860
I've never even been buried because
everyone's scared to come near me.

50:58.337 --> 51:00.100
What's that?

51:01.841 --> 51:03.672
Here's the flour.

51:04.443 --> 51:07.276
- Did anyone hear a moan just then?
- I did.

51:07.446 --> 51:09.004
Did it go like this:

51:11.817 --> 51:13.114
I didn't hear it.

51:13.285 --> 51:17.278
Now, children, when people answer
the doorbells, don't throw too much flour.

51:17.456 --> 51:19.788
Just a small handful right in their face.

51:19.959 --> 51:21.586
Mama, that was Mrs. Wilkins.

51:21.760 --> 51:25.890
Said she'll leave the hammock on the porch,
and will the children return it...

51:26.065 --> 51:30.195
...when they're through stealing it?
- Yes, and get back early or no ice cream.

51:30.369 --> 51:31.927
- All right.
- All right, Mommy.

51:32.104 --> 51:36.768
You couldn't catch me out
on a night like this for a million dollars.

51:38.711 --> 51:39.973
We'll show them.

51:40.146 --> 51:46.085
If you wet the flour before you throw it, it
makes it harder for the victim to get it off.

52:12.311 --> 52:15.337
You, you, you, you, come here!

52:15.514 --> 52:19.143
- Take the Braukoffs!
- Oh, no. We ain't gonna take the Braukoffs.

52:19.318 --> 52:20.615
What's the matter? Scared?

52:20.786 --> 52:23.914
No. We'll take the Mitchells.
They're just as bad.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.007
Who's that?

52:50.182 --> 52:52.412
It's me, Agnes.

52:52.585 --> 52:55.782
- And who's that?
- That's Tootie.

52:57.856 --> 52:59.687
Look at Tootie!

52:59.858 --> 53:02.656
All right, go with them.
They're taking the Braukoffs.

53:02.828 --> 53:06.161
- No, we're taking the Mitchells!
- All right, take the Mitchells!

53:06.332 --> 53:09.392
- But pull down their fence and kill them all!
- All right!

53:09.568 --> 53:12.002
No, not you!
You're too little.

53:12.605 --> 53:16.405
You stay here, Tootie.
And don't go too near the fire.

53:19.511 --> 53:23.675
Let me help! Let me help!
Let me help!

53:25.084 --> 53:28.247
- Oh, let me help! Please let me help!
- Get out of the way.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.682
Let me help!

53:29.888 --> 53:34.188
Johnny! Hey, Johnny! We just killed
eight more people. Big ones too!

53:34.360 --> 53:36.920
We tortured them!
Burnt the soles of their feet.

53:37.096 --> 53:40.827
- Fine! Now go get the Braukoffs.
- No, we're gonna get the Ferrises.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.902
All right then, the Ferrises.
But blow down their house, roof and all!

53:45.070 --> 53:46.901
- Come on!
- Can I go too?

53:47.072 --> 53:50.439
No, no, Tootie, you stay here.
You're too little.

53:50.609 --> 53:52.839
Why don't you go home?

53:54.713 --> 53:57.910
- Somebody's gotta take the Braukoffs!
- I'll take them!

53:58.083 --> 54:00.415
I'll take the Braukoffs.

54:00.586 --> 54:05.387
- Yeah, let Tootie take them!
- No! The Braukoffs have a fierce bulldog!

54:05.557 --> 54:06.990
She'll be torn to pieces!

54:07.159 --> 54:09.684
Yeah, you better go home.
You're too small.

54:09.862 --> 54:13.127
I am not. I won't go home.
I'll take the Braukoffs.

54:15.801 --> 54:18.099
All right.
Tootie takes the Braukoffs.

54:18.270 --> 54:22.832
Remember, if you don't hit Mr. Braukoff in
the face with flour and say, "I hate you"...

54:23.008 --> 54:26.136
...the banshees will haunt you forever!
Give her some flour.

54:26.312 --> 54:28.280
No, I got my own flour.

56:44.249 --> 56:45.739
Well?

56:46.018 --> 56:49.249
L... I hate you, Mr. Braukoff.

57:19.885 --> 57:21.512
Tootie!

57:22.187 --> 57:24.849
- What have you been doing?
- She took the Braukoffs.

57:25.023 --> 57:27.048
- All alone?
- What's the matter, Tootie?

57:27.226 --> 57:30.457
- Did the bulldog try to bite you?
- Did Mr. Braukoff chase you?

57:30.629 --> 57:33.757
- Tootie, can't you talk?
- I killed him!

57:33.932 --> 57:36.162
She killed him all alone.

57:36.335 --> 57:39.099
Hey, wait a minute! Listen!

57:39.271 --> 57:42.502
Listen! Quiet! Quiet!

57:42.674 --> 57:46.770
Tootie killed the Braukoffs single-handed.
She's the bravest of them all!

57:46.945 --> 57:49.140
Yeah! Tootie's the most horrible!

57:49.314 --> 57:51.441
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

57:51.617 --> 57:54.882
Tootie Smith, you're free.
Your banshee is dead.

57:55.053 --> 57:58.181
- Here, throw that on the fire.
- I'm the most horrible!

57:58.357 --> 58:00.917
I'm the most horrible!

58:20.913 --> 58:23.313
Thank you for dropping me off,
Colonel Darly.

58:23.482 --> 58:25.848
It was my pleasure, Miss Smith.

58:31.256 --> 58:35.022
The ice cream would have melted
if it weren't for your thoughtfulness.

58:35.193 --> 58:38.560
Glad to be of service.
Good night.

58:39.631 --> 58:41.030
Would you like to come in?

58:41.199 --> 58:44.726
There's plenty of ice cream,
and my folks would love to meet you.

58:44.903 --> 58:46.928
Thank you,
but some other time perhaps.

58:47.105 --> 58:48.902
Oh, give my regards to Tootie.

58:49.074 --> 58:51.838
Thank you.
She's such a chere enfant.

58:52.010 --> 58:55.844
Yes. Yes, she certainly is.
Good evening.

59:07.359 --> 59:10.453
- Rose! Him!
- Oh, Es, he's simply enchanting.

59:10.629 --> 59:13.393
- And so mature.
- How'd it happen? Where did you meet?

59:13.565 --> 59:16.261
I was coming out of Huntsinger's,
he was coming in.

59:16.435 --> 59:18.869
- I bumped into him.
- Accidentally?

59:19.037 --> 59:22.200
- Almost.
- Oh, Rose, I think that's the most exciting...

59:23.208 --> 59:24.732
- Tootie.
- Where is she?

59:24.910 --> 59:27.344
I thought I heard the trolley when...

59:30.849 --> 59:32.714
Tootie!

59:33.552 --> 59:36.578
- Rose, did you hear a scream?
- Yes, it's Tootie!

59:36.755 --> 59:39.553
- I heard Tootie. Where is she?
- Down by the trolley.

59:39.725 --> 59:41.488
Something's happened!

59:45.831 --> 59:47.958
Oh, my Tootie!

59:48.133 --> 59:51.193
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, here!

59:51.370 --> 59:54.669
- My, darling. Don't cry, honey.
- Somebody telephone the doctor.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.468
If you can't get Dr. Girard,
get Dr. Brown.

59:57.976 --> 01:00:01.207
- Katie, get some hot water.
- Yes, yes, right away.

01:00:02.214 --> 01:00:06.150
- It's all right now.
- All right, honey. You'll be all right.

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:09.312
- He tried to kill me.
- Mama, I think it's her lip.

01:00:09.488 --> 01:00:14.653
Let me see, honey. Now, Mother won't
hurt her baby. Let me see, dear.

01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:17.386
- She lost a tooth.
- The doctor must be walking.

01:00:17.562 --> 01:00:21.658
- Shall I call Papa at the office?
- Good heavens, no. What could he do?

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:25.325
- There, there, darling.
- He tried to kill me.

01:00:25.504 --> 01:00:27.563
Now, tell Mama, what happened?

01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:31.572
- I think a streetcar hit her.
- It must have tossed her onto the cinders.

01:00:31.743 --> 01:00:36.112
No, it wasn't the streetcar.
It was John Truett.

01:00:36.882 --> 01:00:39.612
He tried to kill me.

01:00:39.785 --> 01:00:43.551
- John Truett?
- John Truett hit you?

01:00:43.722 --> 01:00:49.160
He tried to kill me, and when I screamed,
he ran away.

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:52.158
Tootie Smith,
that's a monstrous falsehood.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:56.232
John Truett wouldn't hit a girl,
least of all my sister.

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:01.062
Let me have your coat, doctor.

01:01:01.239 --> 01:01:03.730
Well, Tootie, what is it this time?

01:01:03.909 --> 01:01:08.869
- John Truett hit her, Dr. Girard.
- Well, let's have a look here, huh?

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.614
He hit her, all right.
Someone did.

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:21.925
I'm afraid I'll have to take
a couple of stitches.

01:01:24.062 --> 01:01:26.496
Well, no bones broken, though.

01:01:30.302 --> 01:01:32.236
What's that in your hand?

01:01:32.437 --> 01:01:36.669
- Come on, Tootie, let the doctor see it.
- Let's see. What is it? Come on, what...?

01:01:36.842 --> 01:01:41.074
It... It's hair,
and I don't think it's Tootie's.

01:01:41.246 --> 01:01:45.273
I had to do it.
He tried to kill me.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:48.214
She must have had quite a struggle
fighting him off.

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:51.082
Most of it still has the roots on them.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:54.425
Let's see, now.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:59.320
We'd better take her upstairs to bed.
Can you help me? There we are.

01:02:10.776 --> 01:02:12.368
- Hello, Esther.
- John Truett?

01:02:12.544 --> 01:02:16.105
- Yes?
- I've come here to ask you something.

01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:19.307
What do you mean hitting
a 5-year-old child?

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:22.643
Esther.

01:02:23.755 --> 01:02:28.590
The next time you want to hit somebody,
pick on somebody your own sie.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.819
Hey, Esther...!

01:02:36.168 --> 01:02:41.367
If there's anything I hate, loathe,
despise and abominate, it's a bully!

01:02:47.345 --> 01:02:50.314
- I want to sleep right here.
- Of course you may, dear.

01:02:50.482 --> 01:02:55.181
- I want to wear Esther's nightgown.
- I'll get it for you right now.

01:02:56.054 --> 01:02:59.217
I hate to think what your father
will say about this.

01:02:59.391 --> 01:03:01.882
He may strike that Truett boy.

01:03:02.861 --> 01:03:05.989
- I'll do that, Mama.
- I'll get you some ice cream and cake.

01:03:06.164 --> 01:03:09.133
Feed a cold, starve a fever.

01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:13.428
I was drunk last night, dear Mother

01:03:13.638 --> 01:03:16.698
I was drunk the night before

01:03:16.975 --> 01:03:19.671
But if you'll forgive me, Mother

01:03:19.845 --> 01:03:22.712
I'll never get drunk anymore

01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:26.180
I got him. He didn't even have a chance
to scratch me.

01:03:26.351 --> 01:03:27.750
Your dress is torn.

01:03:27.919 --> 01:03:30.911
Must have happened while he was
trying to hold me off.

01:03:31.356 --> 01:03:33.881
- I bit him.
- I bit him too.

01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:36.118
Tootie, I saw the whole thing!

01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:39.229
- You should've run when I did.
- What happened?

01:03:39.397 --> 01:03:41.797
When I got loose from John, I ran back.

01:03:41.967 --> 01:03:45.733
There was a policeman and a big crowd,
and he was mad.

01:03:45.904 --> 01:03:48.600
- Everyone in the trolley was mad.
- Mad about what?

01:03:48.773 --> 01:03:50.365
- Did it go off the track?
- No.

01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:53.636
But the cable came off when the
motorman put on the brakes.

01:03:54.145 --> 01:03:58.411
- What have you two been up to?
- Nothing. It was that dress we found.

01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:03.077
- We stuffed it.
- It looked just like a body. A live body too.

01:04:03.255 --> 01:04:06.918
We put it on the track.
We thought the streetcar would go off.

01:04:07.092 --> 01:04:11.392
You're nothing less than a murderer.
You might have killed doens of people.

01:04:11.563 --> 01:04:14.293
Rose, you're so stuck-up.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.302
Tootie, how did you get that lip?

01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:21.637
Agnes and I put the lady on the track.

01:04:21.806 --> 01:04:24.434
And when John Truett saw the streetcar...

01:04:24.609 --> 01:04:30.445
...he tried to make us stay in the woodshed
so the policemen wouldn't get us.

01:04:30.615 --> 01:04:34.107
As though policemen
ever pay attention to girls.

01:04:34.886 --> 01:04:37.548
Get out of that bed
and take my nightgown off.

01:04:37.722 --> 01:04:41.522
Let her alone. After all, she was good
about her lip and didn't cry.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.052
You're not my sister.

01:04:44.229 --> 01:04:47.960
You're the most deceitful, horrible,
sinful little creature I ever saw.

01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:51.625
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Were those people very mad?

01:04:51.803 --> 01:04:55.295
- They were furious!
- The motorman nearly had a fit!

01:04:55.473 --> 01:04:59.068
You shouldn't laugh.
There's nothing to laugh at.

01:05:05.383 --> 01:05:07.715
That's terrible!

01:05:08.954 --> 01:05:12.117
Merciful heavens! John...

01:05:26.104 --> 01:05:27.696
John.

01:05:30.442 --> 01:05:33.070
John, I've come to ask you something.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.046
I just found out that...

01:05:39.451 --> 01:05:41.919
Did I do that?

01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:46.090
And this. And this.

01:05:46.992 --> 01:05:48.789
And this.

01:05:49.894 --> 01:05:51.225
John, I...

01:05:51.396 --> 01:05:56.834
- I'm terribly sorry if I hurt you.
- It's no worse than football practice...

01:05:57.002 --> 01:05:59.493
...except it's better with a girl.

01:06:01.172 --> 01:06:02.571
How's Tootie?

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:04.436
Oh, Tootie...

01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:07.373
- She'll live.
- I heard her crying.

01:06:07.545 --> 01:06:11.003
I guess.
So did everybody in St. Louis.

01:06:15.653 --> 01:06:19.316
John, it's awfully nice of you
to accept my apology.

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:23.724
If you're not busy tomorrow night,
could you beat me up again?

01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:31.032
Well...

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:34.000
...I guess I'd better be getting home.

01:06:34.172 --> 01:06:39.109
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, yeah, right. I guess so.

01:06:40.245 --> 01:06:42.509
Well...

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.841
...good night.
- Good night.

01:06:45.016 --> 01:06:46.677
Esther?

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.047
Would you mind helping
me turn off the lights?

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:57.193
I'm afraid of mice.

01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:02.492
All the lights are out.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:05.363
Wouldn't take a minute
to turn them on.

01:07:05.537 --> 01:07:09.598
Well, wouldn't that be
kind of wasting a minute?

01:07:09.774 --> 01:07:13.005
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it would.

01:07:24.022 --> 01:07:25.489
You know...

01:07:26.658 --> 01:07:29.627
...you've got a mighty strong grip...

01:07:29.794 --> 01:07:32.058
...for a boy.

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:47.771
Here comes the invalid.

01:07:49.247 --> 01:07:53.809
I have to have two kinds of ice cream.
I'm recuperating.

01:07:54.219 --> 01:07:57.086
If I ever catch you
fibbing again like you did...

01:07:57.255 --> 01:08:00.088
...I'll give you something
to recuperate about.

01:08:18.276 --> 01:08:20.801
Esther, your ice cream is melting.

01:08:21.179 --> 01:08:22.805
Isn't it?

01:08:27.452 --> 01:08:30.148
Esther, is there anything
wrong with you?

01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:32.220
Yes, Mama.

01:08:39.163 --> 01:08:43.225
Roses are red, John's name is Truett
Esther's in love and we always knew it

01:08:43.768 --> 01:08:47.828
I refuse to stay while my sister's humiliated
by these ghastly children.

01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:49.667
They're your sisters too.

01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:52.104
Stop it, you two, or up you go.

01:08:52.477 --> 01:08:56.140
"Truett." "Knew it."
That's pretty good.

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:59.147
I can't think of any word
that rhymes with "colonel."

01:08:59.317 --> 01:09:00.578
Unless it's "infernal."

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:06.220
It's very difficult for a person to have
any private life in this family.

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:10.886
Well, another Halloween.
We're all a year older.

01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:13.656
- This where the Smith family lives?
- Hello, Papa.

01:09:13.831 --> 01:09:19.029
We stopped a trolley, I lost my tooth.
I got two stitches, and I didn't cry once.

01:09:19.203 --> 01:09:23.072
- What's this, Anna?
- She fell and cut her lip. She's fine.

01:09:23.341 --> 01:09:25.138
That's a brave little girl.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.800
Anna?

01:09:27.545 --> 01:09:29.479
- Sweets to the sweet.
- Louis Sherry!

01:09:29.647 --> 01:09:32.207
Why, Lonnie, what a lovely box...

01:09:32.716 --> 01:09:34.116
Is anything wrong?

01:09:34.285 --> 01:09:38.813
Just because I bring you a present,
you think I've been up to something.

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:43.450
Well, I have. I have good news.
Don't fly up in the air.

01:09:43.627 --> 01:09:47.859
I'm as cool as a cucumber.
You're shaking like I don't know what.

01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:52.867
I was going to tell you before,
but I wanted to wait until it was definite.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.898
The firm is sending me to New York.

01:09:56.074 --> 01:09:59.271
Is that all?
Well, we can live without you for a while.

01:09:59.444 --> 01:10:02.277
They'll be safe with me.
I've got 12 guns in my room.

01:10:02.447 --> 01:10:07.248
- You'll be back by Thanksgiving.
- You don't understand.

01:10:07.418 --> 01:10:11.718
They're sending me to New York for good.
To be head of the New York office.

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:14.923
- New York!
- What?

01:10:16.494 --> 01:10:18.485
I don't believe it.

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:20.830
I simply don't believe it.

01:10:21.032 --> 01:10:22.829
It's true.

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:26.095
I start the first of the year.
We'll leave after Christmas.

01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:29.172
I thought we'd like to have
Christmas in St. Louis.

01:10:29.374 --> 01:10:30.932
I think I'll go pack.

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:34.601
It will take a week to dig up
all my dolls from the cemetery.

01:10:34.779 --> 01:10:37.714
Come back.
There'll be no packing as yet.

01:10:38.449 --> 01:10:43.079
There are many things to talk over and
you two are being very cool about it.

01:10:43.254 --> 01:10:44.744
Why, Anna.

01:10:44.922 --> 01:10:46.719
I thought you'd be overjoyed.

01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:52.830
New York is a big city.

01:10:52.997 --> 01:10:55.158
Not that St. Louis isn't big...

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.530
...but it just doesn't seem very big
out here where we live.

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:02.103
And what will the children do?

01:11:02.774 --> 01:11:04.401
The same as they do here...

01:11:04.575 --> 01:11:07.567
...go to school, play,
have their friends over.

01:11:08.513 --> 01:11:09.912
What friends?

01:11:10.081 --> 01:11:13.414
- Yes. What friends?
- The friends they'll meet in school.

01:11:13.718 --> 01:11:15.345
I don't go to school.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.852
You will someday,
if they'll take you in.

01:11:18.022 --> 01:11:21.253
Agnes just ready to be promoted
and Esther going to be a senior.

01:11:21.426 --> 01:11:25.192
- I've worked all my life to be a senior.
- And Rose is to be graduated.

01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:29.129
Graduation is the least.
All the people I care about are in St. Louis.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.201
And what about me and my life?

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.736
You can take that with you.

01:11:34.906 --> 01:11:37.136
It's settled.
We're moving to New York.

01:11:37.308 --> 01:11:41.768
You're being very calm
about the way you pack us off.

01:11:41.946 --> 01:11:45.177
I've got the future to think about.
The future for us all.

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:49.480
I've got to worry about money, with
Lon in Princeton and Rose going to college.

01:11:49.654 --> 01:11:52.714
Maybe Rose won't have to go.
Things are happening.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.485
Tonight she met Colonel Darly,
and he was very smitten with her.

01:11:56.661 --> 01:12:00.290
I'm sure he was, but next year
she'll still want to go to college.

01:12:00.465 --> 01:12:03.093
I hate, loathe, despise
and abominate money.

01:12:03.267 --> 01:12:06.259
- You also spend it.
- And what about Katie...

01:12:06.437 --> 01:12:08.803
...and Grandpa and the chickens?

01:12:08.973 --> 01:12:12.966
- That's a minor detail we can discuss later.
- I'm a minor detail, am I?

01:12:13.144 --> 01:12:15.772
You all know I was talking
about the chickens.

01:12:15.947 --> 01:12:19.007
Of course.
Never mind what happens to your family.

01:12:19.183 --> 01:12:22.311
At a time like this,
talk about the chickens.

01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:32.294
Now, I guess you're all a little excited.

01:12:32.463 --> 01:12:35.432
We'll talk this over calmly tomorrow.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.626
Well, hickory nut cake
as only Katie can make it.

01:12:38.803 --> 01:12:41.328
I can't move to New York.
I just can't.

01:12:41.506 --> 01:12:44.566
I'm taking my cat.
Lady Babbie goes wherever I go.

01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:47.540
Where you gonna keep her?
Cooped up in a tenement?

01:12:47.712 --> 01:12:49.976
Don't they have houses in New York?

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:54.608
Rich people have houses.
People like us live in flats.

01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:57.550
I'd rather be poor
if we could stay here.

01:12:57.722 --> 01:13:01.681
I'd rather go with the "orphalins"
at the orphalins home.

01:13:01.893 --> 01:13:03.724
And what about the world's fair?

01:13:03.895 --> 01:13:08.195
Just when St. Louis was going to be
the center of attraction of the universe.

01:13:08.666 --> 01:13:11.999
We'll come back here to see the fair.
Maybe.

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:16.698
- Katie, it's as light as a feather.
- You can bake anything in that stove.

01:13:17.408 --> 01:13:20.866
They have little box stoves in tenements.

01:13:22.547 --> 01:13:26.449
- Anna, how's this?
- Oh, it's too much, Lonnie.

01:13:30.721 --> 01:13:32.712
This is your favorite too, Rose.

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.724
No, thank you, Papa.
I'll have some later before bed.

01:13:36.894 --> 01:13:40.489
- Esther?
- No, Papa. I had too much ice cream.

01:13:41.399 --> 01:13:45.301
- Grandpa, I guess you can handle this, huh?
- Thanks.

01:13:51.242 --> 01:13:54.439
I suppose you two are going to fight
over the candy flower.

01:13:54.612 --> 01:13:58.571
- You can have the candy flower, Tootie.
- No, thank you just the same.

01:13:58.749 --> 01:14:02.981
I'm starting a tunnel tomorrow
from our garden under the streetcar tracks...

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:05.122
...and into Mrs. Middleton's terrace.

01:14:05.289 --> 01:14:09.248
Then while she's walking around
her lawn someday, I'll grab her by the leg.

01:14:09.427 --> 01:14:12.419
- It'll take months.
- And I'm not going till I'm finished.

01:14:12.597 --> 01:14:17.398
- Don't use that impudent tone to your father.
- She's just stating a fact.

01:14:20.204 --> 01:14:22.035
Excuse me.

01:14:30.648 --> 01:14:33.913
- How about a game of cribbage?
- Not tonight, Lonnie.

01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:36.553
I've got some things to do.

01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:38.348
Excuse me.

01:14:48.966 --> 01:14:52.026
Aren't you afraid to stay here
alone with a criminal?

01:14:52.803 --> 01:14:55.397
Well, that's what I'm being treated like.

01:14:55.573 --> 01:15:00.909
I'm trying to earn more money to give
my grateful family everything they deserve.

01:15:01.078 --> 01:15:02.670
That's worse than murder.

01:15:02.847 --> 01:15:05.645
I'm wrecking everybody's life.

01:15:10.721 --> 01:15:13.383
Now, Lonnie, it's not as bad as that.

01:15:13.558 --> 01:15:18.154
If you think it's best for us to go away,
why, that's what we'll do.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.023
Now, eat your cake, dear.

01:15:57.368 --> 01:16:01.737
It's good to hear you play, Anna.
It's been a long time.

01:16:10.514 --> 01:16:12.914
Whatever made you think of that?

01:16:35.539 --> 01:16:37.871
I'll put it down in your key.

01:19:51.435 --> 01:19:53.369
Well, what's so funny?

01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:57.298
This one's named Lucille Ballard.

01:19:58.042 --> 01:20:00.067
Oh, it is, is it?

01:20:04.114 --> 01:20:07.948
- I suppose that was your idea.
- Lon, don't get so touchy just because...

01:20:08.118 --> 01:20:11.747
...Lucille doesn't think you're
good enough to take her to the dance.

01:20:11.922 --> 01:20:14.948
A girl has got a right
to go with anyone she wants.

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:19.027
- I just didn't ask her soon enough.
- Everyone knows she's an Eastern snob.

01:20:19.196 --> 01:20:21.426
Keep Miss Ballard's name out of this.

01:20:21.599 --> 01:20:24.329
Just because you had
a few dates with her...

01:20:24.501 --> 01:20:27.766
...don't lose your sense of proportion.
- Look who's talking.

01:20:27.938 --> 01:20:30.805
You're sulking because
Warren Sheffield didn't ask you.

01:20:30.975 --> 01:20:34.376
That's not true.
Rose turned down scads of dates.

01:20:34.545 --> 01:20:37.981
- She could have had any man she wanted.
- Except Warren Sheffield.

01:20:38.148 --> 01:20:43.677
Lucille Ballard's just throwing herself
at Warren because of his father's money.

01:20:43.854 --> 01:20:47.187
This is what I call real Christmas spirit.

01:20:47.358 --> 01:20:51.954
You two have spent this entire vacation
at each other's throats.

01:20:52.129 --> 01:20:56.122
Alono Smith, did it occur to you
you might take your sister to the dance?

01:20:57.034 --> 01:20:59.798
Is there anything wrong
with going with your brother?

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.962
- And be the laughingstock of St. Louis?
- Oh, thank you.

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.836
Katie's right.
That solves all of our problems.

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:11.380
- And it's so full of the spirit of Christmas.
- Leave Christmas out of this.

01:21:11.582 --> 01:21:14.312
It's our last Christmas dance in St. Louis.

01:21:14.485 --> 01:21:18.785
- It'd be tragic if either of you missed it.
- You can talk. You have a date.

01:21:18.956 --> 01:21:21.925
- A real one.
- Lf I didn't have a date with John Truett...

01:21:22.092 --> 01:21:23.354
...which I have...

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.687
...I'd be thrilled to go with my brother.

01:21:25.863 --> 01:21:29.890
- Then that settles it.
- Wait! What's she got to do with this?

01:21:30.367 --> 01:21:31.834
Well...

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:35.301
...if you two won't go with each other,
I won't go either.

01:21:35.472 --> 01:21:39.238
You ought to be ashamed,
wrecking your poor sister's evening.

01:21:40.277 --> 01:21:42.643
Rose? I'd be willing...

01:21:42.813 --> 01:21:44.576
...I mean, glad to...

01:21:45.883 --> 01:21:49.375
- You would, Lon?
- I was going to ask you anyhow, but l...

01:21:49.553 --> 01:21:52.818
You two will have
the best time of anybody.

01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:56.187
You won't have to be
polite to each other.

01:21:57.261 --> 01:21:58.660
It'll be all right.

01:21:58.829 --> 01:22:00.888
Now, take a deep breath.

01:22:01.065 --> 01:22:02.930
Oh, come on.

01:22:07.004 --> 01:22:09.996
That was all right, wasn't it?
It didn't hurt.

01:22:15.579 --> 01:22:18.480
Es, it does wonders for your figure.

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:24.754
- I'm like the ossified woman in a sideshow.
- You look grand, simply elegant.

01:22:25.923 --> 01:22:29.154
I feel elegant, but I can't breathe.

01:22:29.326 --> 01:22:31.294
No, please...

01:22:33.731 --> 01:22:38.031
I think if I just can sit down for a minute.

01:22:47.478 --> 01:22:50.811
- I can't go through with it.
- You've got to start sometime.

01:22:50.981 --> 01:22:57.011
I went through this last year. And if we ever
needed every ounce of allure, it's tonight.

01:22:57.187 --> 01:23:02.352
If we're going to wreck Lucille Ballard's
evening, we've got to be a sensation.

01:23:02.526 --> 01:23:05.654
Don't you think I could be a sensation
without the corset?

01:23:05.829 --> 01:23:11.461
You're competing with an Eastern girl. I'll
wager she doesn't move without a corset.

01:23:12.369 --> 01:23:15.167
Well, I certainly don't
relish wearing this thing...

01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:20.003
...but pride has come to the rescue.
For tonight, I'll do anything.

01:23:20.177 --> 01:23:23.271
It'll be worth it.
If we create a breathtaking effect...

01:23:23.447 --> 01:23:26.575
...it'll be simple to monopolie
all the worthwhile men.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:28.547
Exactly.

01:23:29.119 --> 01:23:32.384
There are only going to be about
20 boys worth looking at.

01:23:32.556 --> 01:23:35.047
We can certainly handle 20 men.

01:23:35.259 --> 01:23:36.954
I should hope.

01:23:37.127 --> 01:23:40.563
- Can you handle 10?
- Well, seven or eight.

01:23:40.731 --> 01:23:43.598
If you guarantee eight,
I can ha...

01:23:45.803 --> 01:23:48.465
I can handle the rest of them.

01:23:48.639 --> 01:23:52.803
- What about John Truett?
- I'll devote myself to John...

01:23:52.976 --> 01:23:56.707
...but in between, I'll make
my presence felt amongst the others.

01:23:56.947 --> 01:23:59.507
- Es? Someone to see you at the back door.
- Who?

01:23:59.683 --> 01:24:02.174
Someone that looks like John Truett.

01:24:07.758 --> 01:24:11.159
- What did you get me for Christmas?
- You'll find out tomorrow.

01:24:11.328 --> 01:24:13.228
I hope it's a hunting knife.

01:24:16.733 --> 01:24:19.293
- Hello, John. Come in.
- Hello.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:23.167
Es, I've got some bad news.

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:28.175
- Your aunt in the hospital?
- No, no. My tuxedo in the tailor's.

01:24:28.345 --> 01:24:30.973
- Well, what about it?
- I was playing basketball...

01:24:31.148 --> 01:24:34.311
...and when I got there, it was closed.
The tuxedo.

01:24:34.485 --> 01:24:36.885
I mean the tailor's.

01:24:37.054 --> 01:24:41.150
- Well, can't you borrow one?
- Everybody who has one is going to the ball.

01:24:42.092 --> 01:24:44.151
Well, what about your father's?

01:24:44.328 --> 01:24:45.852
That was my father's.

01:24:46.864 --> 01:24:50.129
Well, find the tailor
and make him open the shop.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:54.134
I know his name is Jones,
but I don't know where he lives.

01:24:55.906 --> 01:25:00.036
- Oh, this is ghastly.
- I'm sorry, Es.

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:03.143
I wouldn't blame you if you never
spoke to me again.

01:25:03.747 --> 01:25:06.181
Oh, well, you didn't do it on purpose.

01:25:06.783 --> 01:25:09.946
Well, I guess there's nothing else to say.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.816
Unless you want
to do something else tonight.

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:17.889
No, thank you. I think I'll stay home
and do some packing.

01:25:18.061 --> 01:25:22.998
You know, we're leaving St. Louis
in a few days.

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:25.101
I know.

01:25:25.269 --> 01:25:29.330
And this is a fine going-away present
I'm giving you for Christmas.

01:25:29.506 --> 01:25:34.637
- I'll bet you really hate me.
- Oh, no, John, I don't hate you.

01:25:35.579 --> 01:25:38.707
I just hate basketball.

01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:50.592
Es, darling, what is it?
What's the matter?

01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:54.255
Nothing.
I just wish I were dead, that's all.

01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:56.899
Did something happen with John?

01:25:57.067 --> 01:26:01.197
- He can't take me to the dance.
- Why not?

01:26:01.371 --> 01:26:04.204
His father's suit's locked up in the tailor's.

01:26:04.374 --> 01:26:08.174
Oh, that's awful, you poor dear,
but don't worry.

01:26:08.345 --> 01:26:11.109
Lon will take the both of us.

01:26:11.281 --> 01:26:15.741
You don't think I'm going to the smartest
ball of the season with my brother, do you?

01:26:15.919 --> 01:26:18.581
Well, I like that.
You wanted me to go with him.

01:26:18.755 --> 01:26:20.689
Well, that was different.

01:26:20.857 --> 01:26:23.519
- You didn't have a date.
- Neither have you.

01:26:23.694 --> 01:26:24.991
Well, I had one.

01:26:25.162 --> 01:26:28.529
If Lon's good enough to take me
he's good enough for you.

01:26:28.699 --> 01:26:30.599
Besides, you have to go.

01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:34.430
I can't handle 20 men alone.
I admit it.

01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:37.199
One sister going with her brother
has been done...

01:26:37.374 --> 01:26:42.175
...but two sisters makes the whole family
look ridiculous. I won't do it!

01:26:42.346 --> 01:26:45.804
We'll see what Mama has to say about that.

01:26:52.522 --> 01:26:53.887
Come in.

01:26:54.057 --> 01:26:57.618
You know, the man that built this house
cheated your father.

01:26:57.794 --> 01:27:00.786
The walls are as thin as paper.

01:27:01.898 --> 01:27:04.298
- Oh, Grandpa.
- Now, now, now, now.

01:27:05.836 --> 01:27:07.827
You know, with your hair like this...

01:27:08.005 --> 01:27:10.838
...you're the very image of your grandma.

01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:13.408
I remember the first dance I took her to.

01:27:13.577 --> 01:27:16.637
Her father told her she'd
have to be home at 10:00.

01:27:16.813 --> 01:27:20.374
And she was crying, just like you are now.

01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:22.617
I'm sorry. L...

01:27:23.487 --> 01:27:25.580
Oh, you must think I'm an awful baby.

01:27:25.756 --> 01:27:27.690
Now, now, now.
You go right ahead.

01:27:27.858 --> 01:27:32.295
It isn't often a pretty girl
has a real legitimate reason to cry.

01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:34.992
A funny thing.

01:27:35.165 --> 01:27:37.895
I took my tuxedo
out of mothballs yesterday.

01:27:38.068 --> 01:27:40.195
Looks pretty good too.

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:42.395
You know, suits are like men.

01:27:42.572 --> 01:27:45.336
They like to step out once in a while...

01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:47.875
...with a pretty dress.

01:27:48.478 --> 01:27:52.938
That suit of mine does
the greatest one-step you ever saw.

01:27:57.187 --> 01:27:59.985
Grandpa, are you actually...

01:28:03.126 --> 01:28:05.788
What's this about
your not going to the dance?

01:28:05.962 --> 01:28:07.862
Who says I'm not going?

01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:10.158
Of course I'm going...

01:28:10.467 --> 01:28:13.527
...with the handsomest man in town.

01:28:14.438 --> 01:28:16.906
I'll pick you up at 8.

01:29:00.984 --> 01:29:05.011
- Have you got her dance card filled out?
- Practically.

01:29:05.255 --> 01:29:08.850
"Clinton Badger, Hugo Boorvis,
Sidney Gorcey..."

01:29:09.025 --> 01:29:10.686
Oh, Es, you fiend.

01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:13.091
Everyone's a perfect horror!

01:29:13.263 --> 01:29:14.992
She'll remember St. Louis.

01:29:15.165 --> 01:29:16.792
Oh, look. There's Warren.

01:29:20.704 --> 01:29:22.194
- That must be her.
- Come on.

01:29:22.372 --> 01:29:25.967
No. You go on.
I have one more name to put in. Go on.

01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:29.172
- Did he go to Chicago and see the man?
- He started.

01:29:29.346 --> 01:29:31.473
He was going to see him.
What happened...

01:29:31.648 --> 01:29:33.878
- Hello, Lon.
- Good evening, Lucille.

01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:37.042
- How are you, Warren?
- Hello, old man. Good evening, sir.

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.451
- May I present my grandfather?
- Grandpa Prophater.

01:29:40.857 --> 01:29:43.257
- You're one of my favorite people.
- Thank you.

01:29:43.427 --> 01:29:45.418
Lon has spent hours talking about you.

01:29:45.595 --> 01:29:49.292
I can understand any young man
wanting to spend hours talking to you.

01:29:49.466 --> 01:29:51.093
On any subject.

01:29:51.268 --> 01:29:53.600
- Good evening.
- Hello.

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:58.104
- Miss Ballard, may I present Miss Smith?
- Oh, I'm so glad to know you.

01:29:58.275 --> 01:30:01.608
- Is this Esther or Rose?
- Esther will be along in a few minutes.

01:30:01.778 --> 01:30:04.303
Then this must be Rose.

01:30:04.815 --> 01:30:08.808
Now, look. I'm gonna take my life
into my hands and say something.

01:30:08.985 --> 01:30:12.853
That is if I can say it
before Warren tries to strangle me.

01:30:13.023 --> 01:30:17.483
We're all grown up, and if we'd only act
that way, Warren would be here with Rose...

01:30:17.661 --> 01:30:20.596
...instead of spending the evening
talking about you...

01:30:20.764 --> 01:30:25.224
- Lucille!
- Well, you're not going to deny it?

01:30:26.336 --> 01:30:28.827
No. No, I'm not.

01:30:29.039 --> 01:30:32.338
Of course, that leaves Lon and me
without partners.

01:30:32.509 --> 01:30:36.104
But otherwise it's a lovely arrangement.

01:30:36.279 --> 01:30:40.648
I think we can work out that problem
if we give it a little thought.

01:30:40.817 --> 01:30:43.843
Well, we've got the whole evening
to think about it.

01:30:44.988 --> 01:30:47.957
- Hello. How are you, Warren?
- Just fine, Esther.

01:30:48.124 --> 01:30:51.457
Miss Ballard, this is Esther Smith.
Esther, Lucille Ballard.

01:30:51.628 --> 01:30:55.496
- I've been anxious to meet you.
- Esther, we've been talking.

01:30:55.665 --> 01:30:57.189
Yes. I wish I'd been here.

01:30:57.367 --> 01:30:58.629
I hope you don't mind...

01:30:58.902 --> 01:31:02.133
...but we've taken the liberty
of filling out your dance card.

01:31:02.305 --> 01:31:03.704
Thank you.
How considerate.

01:31:03.874 --> 01:31:06.342
I'm so thrilled about you coming
to New York.

01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:10.412
Promise to let me give you your first party.
You will, won't you?

01:31:10.747 --> 01:31:13.181
Esther, the plans have been changed.

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:16.046
Lucille suggested Lon and she
pair off tonight...

01:31:16.219 --> 01:31:18.449
...and Warren and me.

01:31:18.622 --> 01:31:22.217
The plans have been changed.

01:31:28.498 --> 01:31:32.298
What's this about
Miss Ballard's dance card?

01:31:32.469 --> 01:31:35.802
I must have mislaid it.
I better go and find it, though.

01:31:35.972 --> 01:31:38.805
Try looking in your hand.

01:31:42.112 --> 01:31:43.579
"Clinton Badger"?

01:31:43.747 --> 01:31:45.840
"Hugo Boorvis"?

01:31:46.016 --> 01:31:48.382
"Sidney Gorcey"?

01:31:54.457 --> 01:31:58.484
- How about a dance?
- Well, if you're on my card.

01:31:58.662 --> 01:32:00.994
May I have my card, please?

01:32:01.164 --> 01:32:04.031
Is this Miss Ballard's card?

01:32:05.068 --> 01:32:06.899
Well, let me see.

01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:10.665
Oh, no. I made a mistake and put
your name on my card. That's yours.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.467
- Thank you.
- This is mine.

01:32:12.642 --> 01:32:15.839
Why, Lon, you're down for the first dance.

01:32:21.885 --> 01:32:23.876
- Hello.
- Hey, Miss Esther!

01:32:24.054 --> 01:32:27.649
Where's this Lulu Ballard you put me
down for? I'm ready and willing.

01:32:27.824 --> 01:32:30.588
Oh, well, Clinton, there's been a mistake.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.422
- I'm taking her dances, if you don't mind.
- Mind?

01:32:33.597 --> 01:32:35.656
I should say not!

01:33:20.877 --> 01:33:24.335
Pardon me, young man,
but in the great country of China...

01:33:24.514 --> 01:33:27.278
...when a stranger admires
one of your possessions...

01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:30.112
...it's courtesy to offer it to him.
- Interesting.

01:33:30.286 --> 01:33:32.550
Yes. Well, I spent many years in China.

01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:36.988
If you want to make me feel at home,
you might offer me your partner.

01:33:37.761 --> 01:33:40.161
Spoken like a gentleman.

01:33:50.306 --> 01:33:52.774
Oh, Grandpa,
you're the first human being...

01:33:52.942 --> 01:33:55.103
...I've danced with all evening.

01:33:55.278 --> 01:33:57.644
Esther, I wouldn't want this
rumored about...

01:33:57.814 --> 01:34:01.045
...but I'm pretty proud of you.

01:34:01.418 --> 01:34:04.285
It's our last dance in St. Louis.

01:34:04.454 --> 01:34:07.321
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

01:35:04.614 --> 01:35:08.914
I wouldn't have said it, Esther,
if I thought it would make you cry.

01:35:09.285 --> 01:35:13.016
I've imagined you saying it
thousands of times.

01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:16.681
And I always planned
exactly how I'd act.

01:35:18.528 --> 01:35:21.361
I never planned to cry.

01:35:21.998 --> 01:35:25.161
- Well, at least you didn't laugh.
- Laugh?

01:35:25.335 --> 01:35:28.429
I never asked a girl to marry me before.

01:35:28.605 --> 01:35:31.438
- I guess maybe I was kind of...
- Oh, John.

01:35:31.608 --> 01:35:35.009
No one could have done it
more beautifully.

01:35:35.478 --> 01:35:38.174
I'm very proud.

01:35:38.915 --> 01:35:40.712
Esther, will you?

01:35:40.884 --> 01:35:43.944
- Will you, Esther?
- Of course I will, John.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.747
Well...

01:35:54.264 --> 01:35:57.131
Gosh, the time we've wasted.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.894
Say, do you realie
I might have lost you?

01:36:00.069 --> 01:36:02.401
Three more days, you'd have been gone.

01:36:02.572 --> 01:36:04.631
Let's not even think about it.

01:36:04.808 --> 01:36:07.868
We might never have seen
each other again.

01:36:08.111 --> 01:36:11.046
I kept telling myself
even if I did go away...

01:36:11.214 --> 01:36:13.546
...we'd find some way to be together.

01:36:13.716 --> 01:36:15.809
But I never really believed it.

01:36:15.985 --> 01:36:18.783
When you go to New York,
it'll be with your husband.

01:36:18.955 --> 01:36:22.618
Your folks can show us the town.
Meet us at the station.

01:36:22.826 --> 01:36:26.193
- Let's go and tell them now.
- Oh, no. Not tonight.

01:36:26.362 --> 01:36:27.795
I mean...

01:36:27.964 --> 01:36:31.695
...I'd rather just the two of us
knew about it tonight.

01:36:34.137 --> 01:36:36.833
Esther, you're not changing your...

01:36:37.207 --> 01:36:40.665
- You do feel it's the right thing, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

01:36:40.844 --> 01:36:42.675
Yes.

01:36:44.047 --> 01:36:48.143
I don't have to be an engineer.
College takes too long anyway.

01:36:48.318 --> 01:36:51.583
I can get a job right away
and support you in style.

01:36:51.754 --> 01:36:54.188
Of course you can, darling.

01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:56.924
We're not gonna let them
talk us out of it.

01:36:57.093 --> 01:37:00.028
After all, we are of age.

01:37:01.865 --> 01:37:03.856
Practically.

01:37:06.436 --> 01:37:08.529
John.

01:37:09.072 --> 01:37:11.199
Even if I did go to New York...

01:37:11.374 --> 01:37:15.333
...we could still work something out
somehow.

01:37:15.511 --> 01:37:17.479
Couldn't we?

01:37:19.215 --> 01:37:21.581
Do you think so?

01:37:32.829 --> 01:37:35.263
Merry Christmas, John.

01:37:36.399 --> 01:37:39.129
Merry Christmas, Esther.

01:38:11.701 --> 01:38:14.465
Tootie, you bad girl.
You should be asleep.

01:38:14.637 --> 01:38:15.968
Did he come yet?

01:38:16.139 --> 01:38:20.735
I've been waiting such a long time,
and I haven't seen a thing.

01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:23.936
- Did who come?
- Santa Claus.

01:38:24.447 --> 01:38:26.813
He's not going to come
until you're asleep.

01:38:26.983 --> 01:38:29.645
How will he know
how to find us next year?

01:38:29.819 --> 01:38:32.617
He's so used to coming here.

01:38:33.256 --> 01:38:36.714
Oh, you can't fool him.

01:38:36.893 --> 01:38:40.454
He can find anybody he wants to find.

01:38:54.911 --> 01:38:58.142
If Santa Claus brings me any toys,
I'm taking them with me.

01:38:58.314 --> 01:39:01.579
I'm taking all my dolls.
The dead ones too.

01:39:01.751 --> 01:39:05.710
- I'm taking everything.
- Of course you are.

01:39:05.888 --> 01:39:07.856
I'll help you pack them myself.

01:39:08.024 --> 01:39:10.822
You don't have to leave anything behind...

01:39:10.994 --> 01:39:13.724
...except your snow people, of course.

01:39:22.105 --> 01:39:26.098
We'd look pretty silly trying to get them
on the train, wouldn't we?

01:42:06.135 --> 01:42:08.035
Tootie?

01:42:08.804 --> 01:42:10.203
Tootie.

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.369
Tootie.

01:42:12.842 --> 01:42:15.936
- What's wrong with Tootie?
- I don't know, Papa.

01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:28.181
Tootie!

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.960
Tootie, where are you?

01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:36.721
Tootie!

01:42:48.311 --> 01:42:51.940
What are you doing? Come in the house.
You'll catch pneumonia.

01:42:52.114 --> 01:42:54.912
Nobody's gonna have them
if we're going to New York.

01:42:55.084 --> 01:42:57.780
I'd rather kill them
if we can't take them with us.

01:42:57.954 --> 01:43:00.149
Tootie, darling, don't cry.

01:43:00.323 --> 01:43:02.450
It's all right. Don't cry.

01:43:02.625 --> 01:43:05.822
- You can build snow people in New York.
- No, you can't.

01:43:05.995 --> 01:43:09.431
You can't do anything
like you do in St. Louis.

01:43:09.599 --> 01:43:11.726
Oh, no, darling, you're wrong.

01:43:11.901 --> 01:43:15.496
No, no, New York is a wonderful town.

01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:18.799
Look, everybody dreams about going there.

01:43:18.975 --> 01:43:23.412
But we're luckier than lots of families
because we're really going.

01:43:24.647 --> 01:43:27.309
Wait'll you see the fine home
we're gonna have...

01:43:27.483 --> 01:43:30.350
...and the loads and loads
of friends we'll make.

01:43:30.519 --> 01:43:32.953
Wonderful friends.

01:43:33.256 --> 01:43:36.589
But the main thing, Tootie, is,
we're all going to be together...

01:43:36.759 --> 01:43:38.954
...just like we've always been.

01:43:39.128 --> 01:43:41.392
That's what really counts.

01:43:41.564 --> 01:43:46.092
We could be happy anywhere
as long as we're together.

01:44:13.262 --> 01:44:15.856
What's the matter, Papa?

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.634
Nothing, dear.

01:44:20.303 --> 01:44:21.998
Nothing.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:27.465
Everything's fine.

01:45:06.349 --> 01:45:10.046
Come on, darling.
That's a girl.

01:45:10.219 --> 01:45:14.781
Come on, darling.
That's a girl.

01:45:14.957 --> 01:45:18.154
Santa Claus is gonna be here any minute.

01:45:18.327 --> 01:45:20.659
Don't cry.

01:46:01.537 --> 01:46:03.334
Anna! Anna!

01:46:09.278 --> 01:46:12.338
Anna! Anna!
Rose!

01:46:12.515 --> 01:46:14.506
Grandpa! Esther!

01:46:14.683 --> 01:46:17.914
- Lonnie, what is it?
- What is it, Anna? I'm coming.

01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:20.180
- What's the matter?
- What is it, Lon?

01:46:20.356 --> 01:46:22.586
- Go on and sit down.
- What's happened?

01:46:22.758 --> 01:46:25.056
Sit down, everybody.
Over there.

01:46:25.227 --> 01:46:27.627
- Papa, what is it?
- All of you.

01:46:36.138 --> 01:46:38.402
I've got a few words to say.

01:46:38.574 --> 01:46:42.066
We're not moving to New York.
I don't want to hear a word about it.

01:46:42.578 --> 01:46:44.375
We're going to stay right here.

01:46:44.547 --> 01:46:47.778
- We're going to stay here till we rot.
- We haven't rotted yet.

01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:50.919
But what will you say to Mr. Fenton?

01:46:51.187 --> 01:46:52.620
That I've changed my mind.

01:46:52.788 --> 01:46:56.315
I'm a junior partner of Fenton, Rayburn
and Company, not a puppet.

01:46:56.492 --> 01:46:59.586
And if they don't like it,
well, that's just too bad.

01:46:59.762 --> 01:47:01.525
They'll have to like it.

01:47:01.697 --> 01:47:05.394
But Lonnie, you did think it
was a fine opportunity, didn't you?

01:47:05.568 --> 01:47:08.332
New York hasn't got a copyright
on opportunity.

01:47:08.504 --> 01:47:11.803
St. Louis is headed for a boom
that'll make your head swim.

01:47:11.974 --> 01:47:13.532
This is a great town.

01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:17.201
You don't appreciate it because
it's right here under your noses.

01:47:17.379 --> 01:47:21.975
The grass is always greener
in somebody else's yard.

01:47:24.954 --> 01:47:27.479
Rose Smith, we can't go on like this
any longer!

01:47:27.656 --> 01:47:30.648
We're going to get married
at the earliest opportunity.

01:47:30.826 --> 01:47:33.386
And I don't want to hear any arguments!

01:47:33.562 --> 01:47:35.359
That's final.

01:47:35.931 --> 01:47:38.525
I love you!
Merry Christmas.

01:47:39.869 --> 01:47:41.131
Merry Christmas.

01:47:44.206 --> 01:47:48.438
- Anna, who is that boy?
- Now, Lonnie. He's a very fine young man.

01:47:48.611 --> 01:47:51.045
- We'll discuss it later.
- He's so excited...

01:47:51.213 --> 01:47:54.671
...he's liable to leave on his honeymoon
without Rose.

01:47:55.084 --> 01:47:58.679
You handled the whole thing magnificently.
He's putty in your hands.

01:47:58.854 --> 01:48:00.651
Rose, I hope you'll be very happy.

01:48:00.823 --> 01:48:04.418
- I'd like to meet that boy sometime.
- Oh, Papa.

01:48:04.593 --> 01:48:09.826
Mama, Rose is gonna get married.
Maybe she ought to open her presents now.

01:48:09.999 --> 01:48:12.695
You little faker,
it's your presents you're after.

01:48:12.868 --> 01:48:15.837
Good heavens. We've completely forgotten.
It's Christmas.

01:48:16.505 --> 01:48:18.063
Merry Christmas.

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.403
- Merry Christmas, Mama.
- Merry Christmas.

01:48:21.577 --> 01:48:23.602
Merry Christmas, Rose.

01:48:23.779 --> 01:48:28.341
Oh, Papa, you've given us the nicest
Christmas present anybody could ask for.

01:48:28.651 --> 01:48:30.619
Merry Christmas.

01:48:30.786 --> 01:48:33.118
- Merry Christmas, Papa.
- Don't crowd, now.

01:48:33.289 --> 01:48:35.587
I hope you like that,
it's the same as mine.

01:48:35.758 --> 01:48:39.785
- Gee, thanks.
- This is for you, Rose.

01:48:39.962 --> 01:48:41.896
Oh, thank you.

01:48:42.164 --> 01:48:44.564
- This couldn't be a tie.
- It is. I wrapped it.

01:48:44.733 --> 01:48:47.361
- Really?
- This is for Agnes.

01:48:47.536 --> 01:48:49.595
- Thank you.
- This tie is so light...

01:48:49.772 --> 01:48:54.732
...I'll have to wear a muffler.
- A hatpin! Just what I needed!

01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:57.674
Oh, Lonnie.

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.704
- Oh, look at Tootie.
- Oh, here's Warren!

01:49:27.876 --> 01:49:30.606
- Oh, Warren.
- How are you?

01:49:39.221 --> 01:49:41.621
We're gonna beat you.

01:49:46.528 --> 01:49:49.326
- Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

01:49:49.898 --> 01:49:52.298
Perfectly beautiful day.

01:49:52.468 --> 01:49:55.665
- Grandpa, it'll be perfect.
- Come on. Here's the cab.

01:49:55.904 --> 01:49:57.997
Mommy's here.

01:49:58.173 --> 01:50:01.006
Oh, Mommy, you're beautiful!

01:50:11.687 --> 01:50:14.212
- Get in.
- I want to sit with the driver.

01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:16.017
All right, Tootie.
Up we go.

01:50:16.191 --> 01:50:17.818
- There we are.
- All right.

01:50:17.993 --> 01:50:21.588
- Sit over there. Make room for Grandpa.
- There's room enough here.

01:50:21.764 --> 01:50:23.629
- All ready.
- Where to, Mr. Smith?

01:50:23.799 --> 01:50:28.930
- You tell him, Tootie.
- To the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

01:50:29.104 --> 01:50:30.935
Right you are.

01:50:52.294 --> 01:50:54.387
Mama, you should have seen
what we saw.

01:50:54.563 --> 01:50:58.192
- Daddy, you never saw anything like it.
- Stop eating that spun sugar.

01:50:58.367 --> 01:51:01.825
- You'll spoil your dinner.
- Papa, we saw the Galveston Flood.

01:51:02.004 --> 01:51:04.404
Big waves came up and flooded
the whole city.

01:51:04.573 --> 01:51:07.371
When the water went back,
it was muddy and horrible.

01:51:07.543 --> 01:51:09.841
- Full of dead bodies.
- Oh, Tootie.

01:51:16.852 --> 01:51:19.753
Oh, isn't it breathtaking, John!

01:51:19.922 --> 01:51:22.891
I never dreamed anything
could be so beautiful.

01:51:23.058 --> 01:51:27.859
I liked it better when it was a swamp
and there was just the two of us.

01:51:30.065 --> 01:51:32.295
Esther! John!

01:51:34.036 --> 01:51:36.300
I forgot about it too.

01:51:36.872 --> 01:51:41.969
- Hurry up, you two. We're starving.
- I'm so sorry. We didn't mean to keep you.

01:51:42.144 --> 01:51:44.806
- We're all here.
- Where is the French restaurant?

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:48.848
- It's over there.
- No, it's across from Machinery Hall.

01:51:49.952 --> 01:51:53.786
Now, now, let's not lose our heads!
I know exactly where it is.

01:51:53.956 --> 01:51:56.015
Just follow me.

01:51:56.658 --> 01:52:00.594
- Oh, look. The lights!
- Oh, how beautiful!

01:52:12.341 --> 01:52:15.401
There's never been anything like it
in the whole world.

01:52:15.577 --> 01:52:19.274
We don't have to come here on a train
or stay in a hotel.

01:52:20.215 --> 01:52:22.775
It's right in our own hometown.

01:52:23.018 --> 01:52:25.987
Grandpa, they'll never tear it down,
will they?

01:52:26.155 --> 01:52:27.986
Well, they'd better not.

01:52:28.357 --> 01:52:31.121
I can't believe it.

01:52:32.094 --> 01:52:34.460
Right here where we live.

01:52:37.733 --> 01:52:41.294
Right here in St. Louis.
