WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.490
WOMAN:
This is a fiasco.

00:02.530 --> 00:03.861
MAN: I think that we
should cut a deal.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.197
MAN #2:
It is not that simple.

00:05.230 --> 00:06.561
MAN #3:
I deserve to get hurt.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.534
ANNOUNCER:
The People v. 0.]. Simpson.

00:08.570 --> 00:10.800
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.800
FX presents The Americans.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.011
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:21.050 --> 00:23.712
They're not who they say
they are. They're Russians.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.014
What did you tell him?
Everything.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.812
ELIZABETH: If we move fast,
maybe we're okay.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.328
You wanna kill him?
We don't have a choice.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.725
We could try to work him.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.092
GABRIEL:
One of us has been getting

00:34.130 --> 00:36.724
American samples of pathogens.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.864
This is to meningitis
what bubonic plague

00:39.900 --> 00:41.060
is to a runny nose.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.501
STAN: Our office is a target
of the illegals.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.098
Now they got to somebody inside.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.406
Who are you?
I'm your husband,

00:50.450 --> 00:54.716
and I would do
anything to protect you.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.660
What?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.732
Still not used to it.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.948
Yes, you can go into any
department store

01:30.990 --> 01:33.652
and the girl behind the counter
will make you look great.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.887
But if you can't do it yourself
when you get home,

01:36.930 --> 01:37.988
what's the point?
(women chuckle)

01:38.030 --> 01:40.749
We are not here just
to sell a product.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.497
We want to help people.

01:44.530 --> 01:48.933
Young-Hee, can you talk about
how Mary Kay has helped you?

01:48.970 --> 01:53.475
Yes, every time I got a makeover
in a department store,

01:53.510 --> 01:54.772
I come out looking green.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.904
But nobody sells
a green foundation,

01:57.950 --> 01:59.770
so I'm very confused.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.118
And then I see my Asian friends

02:02.150 --> 02:04.289
after their department store
makeover,

02:04.320 --> 02:06.788
I never knew there were
so many shades of green.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.288
(laughter)

02:09.330 --> 02:12.493
No, it's okay.
Mary Kay really helped me.

02:12.530 --> 02:15.795
Now I can help anyone
find makeup for their skin tone.

02:15.830 --> 02:19.789
I tell all my friends they don't
have to look like Martians.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.967
We are all Americans now.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.766
(laughter)

02:25.810 --> 02:28.699
**

03:03.850 --> 03:05.806
In the clergy,
we have very strict rules

03:05.850 --> 03:07.579
about keeping secrets.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.848
People tell us
very personal things,

03:08.880 --> 03:11.087
and they wouldn't do that
if they couldn't trust us.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.551
But I have to be honest,

03:15.590 --> 03:18.024
I've never heard
anything like this.

03:18.060 --> 03:21.257
(exhales sharply)

03:21.300 --> 03:23.825
You know, what we do

03:23.870 --> 03:26.634
isn't so different
from what you do.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.406
I know what spies do.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.169
(scoffs)

03:33.210 --> 03:36.600
Is that the word
that Paige used?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.517
One of the things that we do,
like you,

03:39.550 --> 03:41.711
is work to end
the nuclear threat

03:41.750 --> 03:42.910
that hangs over
all of us.

03:42.950 --> 03:47.683
When we were hired,
we were called peace workers.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.451
We develop relationships
with people from both sides

03:51.490 --> 03:56.894
who wish to defuse the tension
between our two countries.

03:56.930 --> 04:00.093
We fight for justice,

04:00.140 --> 04:02.438
for equal rights
for everyone,

04:02.470 --> 04:06.133
no matter who they are
or what they believe.
Unless they're religious.

04:08.110 --> 04:11.898
Jewish dissidents trapped
in the Soviet Union,

04:11.950 --> 04:12.939
Catholics in Poland.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.916
Our country isn't perfect.
Neither is this one.

04:18.950 --> 04:23.228
(inhales deeply,
clears throat)

04:23.260 --> 04:25.649
I understand the need
for secrecy,

04:25.690 --> 04:27.499
but let's be clear.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.929
A pastor's obligation to keep
parishioners' secrets ends

04:28.960 --> 04:32.669
where his duty
to the greater good begins.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.836
I cannot be a party
to destruction.

04:35.870 --> 04:38.759
What about the destruction
of a family?

04:38.810 --> 04:43.076
If you were to report us,
we would go to prison.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.476
Paige and Henry would go
to foster care,

04:45.510 --> 04:48.149
and there's a good chance
they'd never see us again.

04:48.180 --> 04:54.949
Look, it's clear that
you're a good, decent man,

04:54.990 --> 05:00.792
and...you understand what's
at stake here for Paige.

05:00.830 --> 05:04.960
I do. I understand.
I'm listening to you.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.993
And I'm listening
to my conscience.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.934
(clears throat) Let's all think
about this for a few days

05:15.980 --> 05:18.574
and talk again.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.744
Thank you for coming in.

05:24.850 --> 05:28.616
Have you shared this
with anyone else?

05:28.660 --> 05:30.924
No.
Your wife?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.955
Alice and I minister
to each other.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.059
She understands completely
the sanctity

05:38.100 --> 05:39.738
of the congregation's
confidence.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.169
Pastor Tim told Alice.

06:03.060 --> 06:06.928
Can't seem to get rid of this,
can I?

06:11.270 --> 06:13.761
He could tell anyone,
or she could.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.995
Yes.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.268
We never should've
told Paige.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.039
Well, that's done.
We have to do something now.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.378
And what do you propose?

06:20.410 --> 06:23.948
We should leave...
right now.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.949
There are other ways.

06:26.980 --> 06:32.589
No.
Paige told us she told him.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.417
If we kill him now,
she'll figure it out.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.109
No matter how clean we make it,
she will blame us.

06:36.160 --> 06:36.922
She will hate us.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.178
I will talk to the Centre.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.891
Well, the Centre
trying to recruit her

06:40.930 --> 06:43.091
is what got us into this
in the first place.

06:43.130 --> 06:43.619
We need a plan, Gabriel.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.127
Just keep calm.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.195
The Centre will give us
something to work with.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.801
In the meantime,
you need to help Paige

06:51.840 --> 06:54.900
work on keeping
Pastor Tim quiet.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.943
Just for a little longer.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.948
(indistinct conversations)

07:07.290 --> 07:10.259
Can I have everyone's attention?

07:10.290 --> 07:12.224
In case it's escaped
anyone's notice,

07:12.260 --> 07:13.659
we've been under a bit
of pressure here these days.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.464
And it doesn't help
when we get sloppy.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.229
The counters _
on our Xerox machine

07:18.270 --> 07:23.230
indicate six extra copies
unaccounted for today alone.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.669
I know it's not everybody's
favorite thing to do,

07:24.710 --> 07:28.237
but when people don't log
their copies,

07:28.280 --> 07:29.941
they put the division at risk.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.679
Are we clear?

07:38.790 --> 07:41.088
MAN: I don't think we're
isolating the right information.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.826
MAN: Yeah.
(speaks indistinctly)

07:42.860 --> 07:47.320
(indistinct conversations)

07:47.360 --> 07:49.248
(Muzak playing)

07:49.300 --> 07:50.119
WOMAN OVER P.A.: Produce.
Someone from Produce,

07:50.170 --> 07:52.491
please call Customer Service.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.962
Someone from Produce,
please call Customer Service.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.365
Thank you.

07:58.740 --> 08:01.504
Hey, Patty. Right?

08:01.540 --> 08:03.178
Um, Young-Hee from Mary Kay.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.770
(exhales) Of course,
of course.
(laughs) Hi.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.175
How are you?
What are you doing here?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.711
Tap dance lessons.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.218
(laughter)

08:12.250 --> 08:13.478
Me too.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.657
(laughs)

08:14.690 --> 08:17.454
How many are you feeding?

08:17.490 --> 08:19.458
Oh, uh, three kids,

08:19.490 --> 08:21.993
husband, husband's parents,
oh, and me.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.224
Wow.
(chuckles)

08:23.270 --> 08:25.226
It's amazing
what you get used to.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.225
Yeah.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.737
Have you, uh,
sold anything yet?

08:27.770 --> 08:30.568
H was going to.
I don't know.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.238
I'm...not so good at, uh,
approaching people.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.975
Oh, you just have to get
used to it.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.329
I am sure you could do it.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.871
You know, I really like
the makeup.
Mm. (chuckles)

08:38.910 --> 08:41.970
Um, but that part of it
isn't so easy.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.012
What if I went out
with you?

08:45.050 --> 08:47.518
Hmm? Got you started?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.585
I guess, yeah.
Yeah?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.554
I'd like that.
That would be nice.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.329
Thank you.
Okay, we'll do it.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.567
Uh, let me get your number.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, that'd be great.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.524
(knock on door)
Come in.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.765
Hey.
What's up?

09:03.810 --> 09:06.574
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.708
It's, uh --
It's about Pastor Tim.

09:19.760 --> 09:24.049
I'm so sorry, Dad. I --
I'm not mad.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.255
He told Alice.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.567
W--

09:33.600 --> 09:36.637
How could he do that?
Why would he do that?

09:36.670 --> 09:39.434
People talk,
even the people we trust.

09:39.470 --> 09:41.028
Alice --
when she gets around women,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.048
she always says,
"I shouldn't be saying this."

09:43.080 --> 09:45.139
And then, she says something,
and you're thinking,

09:45.180 --> 09:48.411
"Wow, she's right. She really
shouldn't be saying this."

09:48.450 --> 09:52.238
How could I be so stupid?

09:52.290 --> 09:54.986
I just...I've been so messed up
for so long. I --

09:55.020 --> 09:56.351
It's gonna be okay.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.553
You need to talk
to Pastor Tim.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.397
I can't.

10:02.430 --> 10:06.093
Tim and Alice are a part
of our lives now, a big part,

10:06.130 --> 10:07.836
and will be for a long time.

10:07.870 --> 10:13.399
You have to keep up
the relationship.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.807
Go to him.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.806
Don't make him angry.

10:18.850 --> 10:24.789
So I'm just supposed to pretend
that I don't...

10:24.820 --> 10:27.084
I'm not...
No, it's just...

10:27.120 --> 10:32.353
(sighs) Look, we can't have him
turn against us.

10:32.390 --> 10:36.258
So we have to think about him
in this situation.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.689
He cares about you, Paige.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.960
He -- He doesn't want to
see you hurt.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.947
(air brakes hiss)

10:49.980 --> 10:52.141
(man speaks indistinctly)

10:52.180 --> 10:53.670
Watch your step, ma'am.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.216
(air brakes hiss)

11:05.330 --> 11:08.993
**

11:13.700 --> 11:15.691
(horn honks in distance)

11:23.550 --> 11:25.370
Nothing wrong with the dog
at all.

11:25.410 --> 11:28.140
But that damn vet kept ordering
test after test after test.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.647
I'm telling you,
when I saw the bill --

11:29.680 --> 11:31.341
Really? Nothing wrong
with the dog?

11:31.390 --> 11:32.857
Not a damn thing.
Oh.

11:32.890 --> 11:34.357
And when I saw the bill --
Do you wanna see It?

11:34.390 --> 11:35.652
Do you have
just another minute?

11:35.690 --> 11:37.487
You know, I had
the same thing happen

11:37.530 --> 11:38.224
with my cocker spaniel,
Muffin.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.421
Oh, cute name.
Thanks.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.668
And, you know, I just said,
I decided, no more stupid tests.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.668
Mm-hmm.
And she lived to be 14.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.691
Oh! That's great.
So. ..

11:47.740 --> 11:50.732
Well, anyway, we've taken up
so much of your time.

11:50.770 --> 11:53.330
Oh, oh, wait. I wanted to buy
that TimeWise Miracle set.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.338
Also_ add on _
the Day Radiance foundation

11:56.380 --> 11:57.745
in Suntan Beige.
That was great.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.340
I almost forgot about that.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.745
We get so busy
telling the stories.
(laughs)

12:01.780 --> 12:04.544
It's so great talking to you.
Yeah.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.512
Bye-bye.
You're gonna love that set.

12:06.550 --> 12:09.348
Bye.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.028
You're right. That was
easier than I thought.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.925
Are you sure you're not really
a used car salesman?

12:12.960 --> 12:14.723
(laughter)

12:14.760 --> 12:16.967
Oh, my feet.
Mm.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.039
My feet think we just
climbed Mount Rogers.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.731
I thought you said
those shoes were comfortable.

12:22.770 --> 12:25.603
Yeah, comfortable...
three hours ago.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.130
(laughs) Yeah.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.398
I sound like
my daughter, Sue.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.702
She complain if we have to
walk to the corner.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.742
"Oh, Mom, will you carry me?
My shoes don't fit."

12:33.780 --> 12:37.216
(chuckles)
She's usually right.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.787
Mm.
She's growing so fast.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.550
(sighs)

12:42.590 --> 12:43.750
You okay?

12:43.790 --> 12:47.248
Yes. You know,
just family stuff.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.790
Bonng.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.798
Hmm.
You wanna talk about it?

12:50.830 --> 12:54.766
No. Not really.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.803
Mm. Okay.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.470
You had a really good
first day.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.569
Maybe best I ever saw.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.249
Thank you.
No, really. I mean it.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.747
I mean,
sometimes I don't mean it,

13:08.780 --> 13:11.749
but this time I do.
(laughs)

13:11.790 --> 13:15.089
Oh, you know, it took me

13:15.120 --> 13:16.758
three months to make
my first sale.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.485
Really?

13:18.530 --> 13:22.523
Yeah, I was so pushy.
Hard to believe, right?

13:22.560 --> 13:24.994
But you? You're a natural.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.622
Yeah.

13:26.670 --> 13:29.639
And it is fun, right?

13:29.670 --> 13:31.308
Yeah, it is fun.

13:31.340 --> 13:34.002
(chuckles)

13:34.040 --> 13:36.600
Hey, you wanna come to my house
for dinner tomorrow night?

13:36.640 --> 13:39.541
What's tomorrow?
It's Wednesday.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.615
Yeah, we have family dinner
Wednesdays.

13:40.650 --> 13:44.518
Uh, little bit Korean,
little bit not.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.656
Nothing fancy.
Just lot of fun.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.619
Sure. Yes, I'd love to.

13:52.660 --> 13:56.357
(dog barking in distance)

13:57.430 --> 13:59.193
We are done, Claudia.

13:59.230 --> 14:03.838
Gabriel.
We have to get them out.
We have no other choice.

14:03.870 --> 14:07.408
There's always
another choice.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.829
No one knows that
better than you.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.077
It's not just one thing.
It's too much.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.419
They trust you, Gabriel.
They believe in you.

14:16.450 --> 14:18.509
I hope so.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.657
Do you hear yourself?

14:21.690 --> 14:25.854
The pastor already told
his wife.

14:25.890 --> 14:28.051
There _are
no good ch0|ces here.

14:28.100 --> 14:32.525
First, there are no choices.
Now there are no good choices.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.765
I'd say
we're making progress.

14:38.570 --> 14:42.677
I'll talk to the Centre.
We'll figure something out.

14:42.710 --> 14:45.178
Trying to bring their daughter
in was a mistake.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.678
It's time
to take them home.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.542
(siren wailing in distance)

14:52.990 --> 14:54.514
(zipper whirs)

14:54.560 --> 14:56.255
(sighs)

14:56.290 --> 14:57.689
(takes off boot)

14:57.730 --> 14:59.288
(door opens)

15:03.800 --> 15:05.961
How'd it go?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.139
Good.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.728
It was different.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.102
It was fun.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.598
(zipper whirs)

15:15.640 --> 15:17.369
(sighs)
My feet are killing me.

15:17.410 --> 15:18.547
We must've walked 10 miles.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.277
Are you getting in there?

15:22.320 --> 15:23.742
Yeah.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.784
I, uh...I told Paige.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.718
What did she say?

15:32.760 --> 15:38.721
That she'd talk
to Pastor Tim,

15:38.770 --> 15:40.533
tell him how she feels.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.768
And how does she feel?

15:46.270 --> 15:49.501
Betrayed. (sighs)
Hurt, angry.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.746
No anger.

15:50.780 --> 15:54.170
I know. She knows.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.745
(clothing drops)

15:56.780 --> 16:00.011
Have you patched things up
with Stan yet?

16:02.660 --> 16:06.027
We could use a friendly face
at the FBI.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.756
Yeah.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.859
(exhales deeply)

17:16.060 --> 17:18.620
(sighs, clears throat)

17:38.320 --> 17:40.550
So here you are,
top travel agents,

17:40.590 --> 17:43.252
and you've never been
to Epcot Center.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.019
It's been open for months.

17:45.060 --> 17:49.429
Over 300 acres, lots to see.
You should go. Take the kids.

17:49.460 --> 17:53.362
You could leave on Friday,
come back Sunday night.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.130
While you're away,

17:56.170 --> 17:59.367
the pastor and his wife
will have an accident.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.878
(sighs) What...

18:01.910 --> 18:03.446
What are you -- What -- What do
you -- What do you think?

18:03.480 --> 18:06.699
Paige is an idiot?
She tells us she told him.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.911
We go away, we come back,

18:08.950 --> 18:10.281
and their obituary's
in the paper?

18:10.320 --> 18:11.912
There's a big service
in the church?

18:11.950 --> 18:14.054
She's not stupid, Gabriel.

18:14.090 --> 18:17.924
She'll never be sure.
Will she wonder? Maybe.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.155
But you'll minimize that
this week

18:20.200 --> 18:21.292
while you're in Florida.

18:21.330 --> 18:23.161
You'll_ be with her
every Single moment.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.394
No phone calls.

18:24.430 --> 18:27.467
No private discussions
out of her hearing.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.933
Be in bed asleep before she is.

18:28.970 --> 18:30.961
Have fun.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.932
(sips)

18:32.970 --> 18:37.669
People believe what they need
to believe.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.847
We do this, we come home,

18:42.880 --> 18:45.815
and she finds out
something's happened to them,

18:45.850 --> 18:49.718
the Centre can't think_ we can
ever bring her Into this work.

18:51.990 --> 18:56.927
That's not what's pressing
right now, Philip.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.723
We don't have a choice here.

19:21.990 --> 19:25.153
You honestly think
it'd be better if we leave?

19:25.190 --> 19:27.226
What are you
gonna tell Henry?

19:27.260 --> 19:29.728
That we live in Russia now
because...

19:29.760 --> 19:33.969
We've been wrong about Paige
so many times,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.969
and we're doing it again
right now.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.039
I mean, have --
haven't we learned?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.832
She'll think about this,
and she'll figure it out.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.668
Not right away, but...

19:46.710 --> 19:49.019
she will know.

19:49.050 --> 19:51.143
They've given us a way
out of this

19:51.190 --> 19:54.580
that lets us keep our lives.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.021
(engine starts)

20:07.100 --> 20:09.568
I trusted you.
The confidences I keep
are sacred, Paige.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.760
Alice understands that.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.437
If she didn't,
I couldn't do my job.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.844
You know Alice.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.177
She loves you.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.576
She wouldn't --
Alice likes to talk.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.384
Paige, that's not fair.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.854
When I tell you something,
a secret,

20:27.890 --> 20:30.381
you can't just decide,
"Oh, I think I'll tell my wife."

20:30.430 --> 20:32.250
I am trying to help here.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.791
Help who? Me?

20:33.830 --> 20:34.854
Of course you.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.926
You know how much
I care about you.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.939
And I know how much
you care about others.

20:45.840 --> 20:51.904
And, Paige, until we know
exactly what your parents do

20:51.950 --> 20:55.249
and whether or not people
get hurt as a result --

20:55.280 --> 20:58.147
This is my mom and dad
that you're talking about.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.424
(sighs) I can't do this.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.257
Paige...

21:09.260 --> 21:12.366
Paige.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

21:18.710 --> 21:21.338
Oh, hey,
what is all this stuff?

21:21.380 --> 21:25.146
Big fall-off on spring break
bookings for Miami.

21:25.180 --> 21:28.308
So...you doing tours to Epcot?
Looking into it.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.580
Looking into what?
Epcot.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.350
We should go.
Mm-hmm.

21:33.390 --> 21:36.109
No, it would be a lot of fun.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.981
And maybe we could
go on spring break.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.498
Oh, spring break would be
such a zoo.

21:41.530 --> 21:44.693
We could learn stuff at Epcot.
I could learn a lot.

21:44.730 --> 21:48.268
And can't you get one of
your professional discounts?

21:48.300 --> 21:52.532
They do have off-season
family getaway vouchers.

21:52.570 --> 21:55.539
Good for now?
Until March 3lst.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.468
I mean, they might have
something last minute.

21:57.510 --> 22:00.513
So if there is an opening
this weekend, you wanna go?
Yeah.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.040
(door closes)
Let's see what we can do.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.387
I gotta get going.
Mm. Hey, Paige. Guess what?

22:07.420 --> 22:10.287
We're going to Epcot.
What?

22:10.320 --> 22:13.699
This weekend.
I got them to take us.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.324
You all right?

22:16.360 --> 22:19.227
I need to talk to you.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.048
I talked to Pastor Tim.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.707
Good.
How'd it go?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.968
Notgood.
VVhathappened?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.545
I got upset, and he got upset.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.388
Angry?
Not...angry.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.980
Annoyed.
Like, who am I to tell him

22:43.020 --> 22:45.523
that his wife can't keep
a secret?

22:45.560 --> 22:49.223
Okay, when, uh --
when we get back from Orlando,

22:49.260 --> 22:51.990
let's the three of us go in
and talk to him.

22:52.030 --> 22:52.621
That's a good idea.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.931
(sighs) I still don't know
really what you guys do.

22:59.970 --> 23:03.849
(inhales deeply)
I know you're spies
and everything, but...

23:03.880 --> 23:06.178
(exhales deeply)
do people get hurt

23:06.210 --> 23:08.041
because of things
you're involved with?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.570
No.
Of course not.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.781
Paige, you know us
better than that.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.210
I don't know what I know.

23:17.120 --> 23:17.779
Where do you go
two nights a week?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.048
You know what?

23:20.090 --> 23:21.557
Let's talk about everything
on our trip.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.068
Yeah. While Henry's
on one of those rides

23:24.100 --> 23:27.024
he wants to do 17 times
In a row.

23:27.070 --> 23:27.798
Okay?

23:38.910 --> 23:42.175
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

23:42.920 --> 23:44.888
(both laughing)

23:44.920 --> 23:48.219
(speaking Korean)

23:48.260 --> 23:51.081
Don used to drink soju.
It's a Korean liquor.

23:51.130 --> 23:55.658
(speaking Korean)
(laughter)

23:55.700 --> 23:59.067
(speaking Korean)

23:59.100 --> 24:01.068
They're making fun of Don
because he drink wine

24:01.100 --> 24:03.091
with Korean food.
Oh.

24:03.140 --> 24:04.607
My brother drinks it
with everything --

24:04.640 --> 24:07.268
scrambled eggs.
Oh. Ugh.

24:07.310 --> 24:09.073
A nice Riesling pairs well
with egg,

24:09.110 --> 24:11.601
and it's great with Korean food.
Lots of wine are.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.313
Hey, Pinot Noir,
a chilled Barbera...

24:15.350 --> 24:19.741
(speaks Korean)

24:19.790 --> 24:22.156
She's saying he doesn't even
hold his liquor anyway.

24:22.190 --> 24:23.623
It's true, Don. Admit it.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.322
Not liquor. Sauvignon Blanc.
13% alcohol.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.089
East meets West.
It works for me.

24:28.130 --> 24:30.121
Thank you.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.627
Mm.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.194
(laughter)

24:33.230 --> 24:36.336
Speaking of which, thank you.
I appreciate the fork.

24:36.370 --> 24:38.201
(laughter,
Korean conversation continues)

24:38.240 --> 24:39.502
Hmm.

24:39.540 --> 24:43.271
(chopsticks clinking)

24:43.310 --> 24:45.278
(exhales)
Uh-oh.

24:45.310 --> 24:45.708
Ooh! What did I eat?

24:45.750 --> 24:48.674
One of these?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.109
(murmurs and laughter)

24:51.150 --> 24:53.118
Water won't help.
No.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.708
Do the pepper dance.
Yeah, the pepper dance!

24:54.760 --> 24:57.354
(girls shouting playfully)
Do it, Patty.

24:57.390 --> 25:00.120
The pepper dance.
(laughter)

25:00.160 --> 25:02.151
The pepper dance.
Aah!

25:02.200 --> 25:05.692
It's so hot! Aah!
(laughing)

25:05.730 --> 25:06.719
Just breathe.
(laughter)

25:10.040 --> 25:13.203
Did you see those ugly dolls
in the family room?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.731
Yes, are those the, um...
Cabbage Patch Kids.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.998
Yeah.
Most ugly thing I ever seen.

25:18.050 --> 25:21.508
Why would you want a doll that
look like it hit by a truck?

25:21.550 --> 25:24.747
(laughs)
But TV commercial make my kids
think they need them...

25:24.790 --> 25:28.385
I know.
...so I buy them.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.820
Oh.
And they like them
for five minute.

25:30.860 --> 25:33.158
Yeah.
And then they forget
all about them.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.351
And then they see the doll
on television again.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.356
And they acting like
if I don't buy more,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.322
they're gonna die.

25:39.370 --> 25:41.759
Hmm, that's America for you.
So expensive.

25:41.800 --> 25:46.362
I should buy
Cabbage Patch Doll stock.

25:46.410 --> 25:49.106
(laughs)
Do you have kids?

25:49.140 --> 25:51.279
No.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.777
Do you want my kids?
You can take one.

25:52.810 --> 25:56.018
I'm not kidding.
(laughs)

25:56.050 --> 25:57.369
Which one?

25:59.290 --> 26:01.850
Uh...how is your mouth?

26:01.890 --> 26:04.757
It's better. I'm still
kind of embarrassed, though.

26:04.790 --> 26:08.226
Me too. You should_ never
come here again.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.251
(laughs) Stop it.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.291
(doorbell rings)

26:20.010 --> 26:21.375
gig/é:

26:21.410 --> 26:22.570
I was just dropping
Matthew off.

26:22.610 --> 26:24.441
I thought I'd come
say hi to you guys.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.449
Yeah, Elizabeth isn't home,
but come in.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.785
(door closes)
Uh...

26:31.820 --> 26:34.414
Do you want something
to eat? Some coffee?

26:34.460 --> 26:36.052
Uh, maybe a cup of tea?

26:36.090 --> 26:37.284
Sure, great.

26:37.320 --> 26:40.426
That's about the limit
of my kitchen skills.

26:40.460 --> 26:44.396
How is everyone?
Elizabeth?

26:44.430 --> 26:46.967
Uh...good.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.969
I, um...

26:50.000 --> 26:53.265
I told her that, uh,
I've been going to est.

26:53.310 --> 26:56.768
Wow. Wow.
Um, how'd that go?

26:56.810 --> 26:59.176
She didn't kill me.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.643
(chuckles)

27:00.680 --> 27:02.443
But...

27:02.480 --> 27:05.187
(drawer opens)
No, no "but."

27:05.220 --> 27:07.415
She's okay.
(drawer closes)

27:07.450 --> 27:08.451
She even said
she might go herself,

27:08.490 --> 27:12.119
but I wouldn't lay money
on that.
Mm.

27:13.730 --> 27:17.257
In other news, um...

27:17.300 --> 27:17.868
Stan almost
took a swmg at me

27:17.900 --> 27:20.266
a couple days ago.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.494
What?

27:21.540 --> 27:24.259
Yeah, apparently,
his. . .girlfriend

27:24.310 --> 27:28.030
saw us together after est.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.479
A-At the restaurant?

27:29.510 --> 27:30.602
Mm-hmm. I thought
he was gonna deck me.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.006
(scoffs)

27:33.050 --> 27:35.610
Stan is so into always
being the tough guy.

27:35.650 --> 27:39.643
Oh, I don't know. If it...

27:39.690 --> 27:41.715
suddenly seems like your friend
from across the street

27:41.760 --> 27:45.480
is seeing your wife --
ex-wife...

27:45.530 --> 27:46.883
That's...ridiculous.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.295
How does he know that?

27:48.330 --> 27:50.218
I wouldn't know that
ifI was in his shoes.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.296
His life's a wreck right now.
Not that mine's so great.

27:52.330 --> 27:57.290
Why? What's going on?
Oh, I...It's no-- I'm...
(sighs)

27:57.340 --> 27:58.739
I'm blowing things
out of proportion.

27:58.770 --> 28:02.069
We had a lying incident
with Paige recently.
Mm.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.372
It's just been a mess.

28:03.410 --> 28:07.506
Mm. Well, I mean,
raising teenagers is...ugh.

28:07.550 --> 28:11.042
Oh, I know. Elizabeth and I --
we don't always...

28:11.090 --> 28:13.308
You know.
Yeah.

28:13.350 --> 28:16.478
But we do agree on a lot.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.488
And if my house
burned down tonight

28:18.530 --> 28:21.226
and I had to go someplace else,
they would come with me.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.896
Sta_n -- I could see him
movmg out of that house

28:27.770 --> 28:30.864
because who wants to visit
their dad in a motel?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.764
I've been through it,
Sandra.

28:32.810 --> 28:37.702
(whispers) Yeah.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.206
(normal voice) Yeah, um,

28:39.250 --> 28:42.811
maybe I've been a little
too hard on him.

28:45.050 --> 28:49.350
Mm. Matthew doesn't see _him
enough, and he misses him.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.780
I mean, he would never
say anything, but I can tell.

28:52.830 --> 28:54.821
(sighs)

28:57.930 --> 28:59.693
(copier whirring)

28:59.730 --> 29:02.631
(beeping)

29:08.510 --> 29:09.772
"by the language
and some communications

29:09.810 --> 29:13.041
"that have reached my desk.
"In particular,

29:13.080 --> 29:15.548
"comments expressing
that the FBI 'feels.‘

29:15.580 --> 29:17.445
"The FBI may assess,

29:17.480 --> 29:20.586
"determine, consider
or claim, et cetera,

29:20.620 --> 29:25.489
but it is not appropriate to say
that the FBI 'feels'."

29:25.530 --> 29:26.781
Urgent memo
from the director?

29:26.830 --> 29:29.719
The bureau does not feel,
Stan.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.228
Yeah, I figured that out
a long time ago.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.931
(both chuckle)

29:33.970 --> 29:35.597
(paper rustles)

29:35.640 --> 29:40.259
You had
some feelings about me.

29:40.310 --> 29:43.336
Suspicions.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.506
This thing with Gene Craft
change all that?

29:44.550 --> 29:47.599
Why? Did you put the bug
in the pen, after all?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.587
(lowered voice) You know,
I think we should keep an eye

29:56.620 --> 29:58.281
on Martha.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.025
Martha Hanson?
Mm-hmm.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.255
Oh, come on, Stan.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.619
Gene was found
hanging in his home

30:03.660 --> 30:05.298
with a suicide note.

30:05.330 --> 30:08.037
No sign of struggle,
no sign of forced entry.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.037
The apartment was clean.
He's exactly the kind

30:09.070 --> 30:11.436
of tech guy
the KGB likes to use.

30:11.470 --> 30:12.607
Well, I've been watching Martha
for a few weeks now...

30:12.640 --> 30:15.803
Oh, Jesus.
...and there were two nights

30:15.840 --> 30:16.807
she didn't come home.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.207
I was out there
till 3:00 am.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.468
She could be seeing her folks
or her sister.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.479
Her parents live in Colorado,
and she has no sister.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.216
Maybe she's got a guy?

30:29.260 --> 30:31.626
Look, I think you know
this whole thing with Gene

30:31.660 --> 30:34.049
doesn't sit right.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.524
You wanna find out who
really planted that bug?

30:37.560 --> 30:38.868
Help me track Martha.

30:38.900 --> 30:39.719
I won't do it, Stan.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.409
Fine.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.238
But I'll _take her
to dinner.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.542
**

31:34.160 --> 31:36.549
I'm sorry.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.777
(door opens in distance)

31:58.250 --> 32:00.969
(footsteps approach)

32:14.460 --> 32:15.495
WOMAN: I appreciate it.
Ah, Mr. Philip.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.727
Hi.
I have
your travel documents.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.762
Airplane reservations, uh,
four seats,

32:21.800 --> 32:23.131
aisle 17 to Orlando.

32:23.170 --> 32:26.662
But on the return, I could
only get three together.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.599
Not a problem.
Mm. Entrance pass
to Epcot Center.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.108
Uh, hotel reservations,
two rooms.

32:32.150 --> 32:35.449
Uh, adjacent, non-smoking,
with views.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.608
Views of what?
PGA Championship
Golf Course.

32:38.650 --> 32:41.756
Great, thank you.
I appreciate it.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.610
I...I think
what you are doing

32:43.660 --> 32:46.151
is a-a very important thing
to do --

32:46.190 --> 32:49.353
making time for your family.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.265
We get so busy sometimes,

32:51.300 --> 32:54.838
we forget what is
most important.

32:54.870 --> 32:55.632
Thank you.

32:55.670 --> 32:59.606
(telephone rings)

32:59.640 --> 33:00.766
(Stavos speaking indistinctly)

33:00.810 --> 33:03.836
(sighs)

33:22.700 --> 33:25.726
You still think it'd be
better to leave?

33:25.770 --> 33:28.762
(telephone ringing
in distance)

33:31.670 --> 33:33.262
I do.

33:35.680 --> 33:41.209
But, Philip, you don't even
want that. I know you don't.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.239
Hmm.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.681
Maybe they could send us
down South.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.689
You always dreamed
of Odessa.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.585
By the water.
Yeah.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.435
And then what?

34:08.480 --> 34:11.244
With two kids
who don't know anyone,

34:11.280 --> 34:13.771
don't know the language.

34:13.810 --> 34:17.849
You don't think
they'd hate us then?

34:17.880 --> 34:20.383
And what about us?

34:22.260 --> 34:25.718
I mean, everything that
we've built here.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.719
Our work...

34:29.760 --> 34:32.888
Those things matter.
It's. ..

34:32.930 --> 34:35.933
Don't they matter to you?
It all matters.

34:38.310 --> 34:42.633
Elizabeth, it all matters.
But for the last two days,

34:42.680 --> 34:46.776
I've had an alarm going off
inside me -- "Run, run, run."

34:46.810 --> 34:53.716
And it's not going off
inside of you, so we stay.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.753
It seems Paige loses
whatever we do.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.991
(sighs)

35:15.180 --> 35:17.102
(lowered voice) We have
to meet with Gabriel.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.973
(sighs)

35:26.320 --> 35:30.518
(coughing)
Gabriel?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.982
Gabriel? Gabriel?

35:32.030 --> 35:33.019
(moaning)

35:33.060 --> 35:34.823
Talk to me. Talk to me.
(choking)

35:34.860 --> 35:36.794
Is he choking?

35:36.830 --> 35:41.164
Aah! (gasps) Aah!
(coughing)

35:41.200 --> 35:42.861
He must've fallen.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.629
(weakly)
Get out, get out.

35:44.670 --> 35:45.762
What?
Get out.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.630
What happened?
What happened?!

35:47.670 --> 35:49.331
What if he caught it?
What?

35:49.380 --> 35:52.804
What if he has glanders?
(coughs)

35:52.850 --> 35:53.839
How?

35:53.880 --> 35:55.814
I don't know.
We just touched everything --

35:55.850 --> 35:59.013
blood, uh,
his mouth when he coughed.

35:59.050 --> 36:01.314
We need to leave.
What -- What if
we're contagious?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.316
Maybe we can't leave.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.328
(continues coughing)
We need help.
We need to signal William.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.725
Maybe one of us should
stay with him.
What good would that do?

36:06.760 --> 36:08.955
Just to help him if --
How are you gonna help him?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.127
What are you gonna do?
I don't know. Just...

36:11.160 --> 36:13.822
I feel like one of us should --
I'll stay.

36:13.870 --> 36:16.634
I don't want you in here.
I don't wanna stay here either,
but one of us should be here.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.729
Whoever stays in here
is gonna get sick.

36:18.770 --> 36:20.169
We don't know that.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.409
(coughing and wheezing)

36:33.390 --> 36:35.255
You're sure?

36:35.290 --> 36:36.917
There's no one on you
till Monday.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.188
If you're here

36:38.230 --> 36:39.686
with an access code for me,
I don't wanna know.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.893
It's not that.
We found Gabriel on the floor
of his safe house,

36:42.930 --> 36:44.192
feverish,
having trouble breathing.

36:44.230 --> 36:46.425
But he was conscious?
He was in and out.

36:47.700 --> 36:51.830
How close did you get to him?
We touched him.
He was coughing.

36:51.870 --> 36:56.239
There was blood.
He must've fallen.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.870
**

37:08.890 --> 37:11.882
(grunting)

37:11.930 --> 37:13.727
Get off of me.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.899
Get -- You -- Get off!

37:15.930 --> 37:17.852
Shit!

37:17.900 --> 37:21.097
(grunting)

37:21.130 --> 37:21.733
(spits)

37:21.770 --> 37:26.901
(groans and gasps)

37:26.940 --> 37:28.908
Get off me!

37:28.940 --> 37:30.100
(grunts)

37:30.140 --> 37:33.940
(groaning)

37:33.980 --> 37:39.543
(breathing heavily)

37:39.590 --> 37:40.989
Ugh. (sputters)

37:42.960 --> 37:44.928
Asshole.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.054
(panﬁng)

37:48.090 --> 37:51.924
You should've wrapped Gabriel
in plastic and burned his body.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.897
Come on.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.966
Where?
My apartment.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.979
I might have something.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.976
(switch clicks)

38:11.890 --> 38:14.779
Shoes off, please.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.788
(groans)

38:41.150 --> 38:43.516
I'm not crazy.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.686
I've gotten so many vaccines
because of what I have to do.

38:48.720 --> 38:52.952
It's given me
all these allergies.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.526
(latches click)

38:54.560 --> 38:57.393
What are you allergic to?

38:57.430 --> 39:00.160
Dust, butter,

39:00.200 --> 39:02.794
sausage, candy,
you name it.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.707
I've got
no sense of smell.

39:05.740 --> 39:09.039
My skin has
no natural lubricants.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.947
(vial clatters)

39:19.850 --> 39:23.183
Who's next?

39:23.220 --> 39:26.519
(sighs)

39:26.560 --> 39:28.721
(zipper whirs,
plastic rustles)

39:28.760 --> 39:34.198
I always thought I'd get
infected in the lab,

39:34.230 --> 39:36.767
not in a park in the middle
of the night by two people

39:36.800 --> 39:40.201
who are supposed to be
on my side.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.528
What is it?

39:43.580 --> 39:48.540
Chloramphenicol sodium
succinate.

39:48.580 --> 39:51.378
It's a broad spectrum
antibiotic.

39:58.390 --> 40:01.757
Will it definitely work?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.428
This strain is resistant
to most antibiotics.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.426
Nobody knows if anything
will work,

40:06.470 --> 40:08.290
but it's probably
our best shot.

40:14.070 --> 40:17.904
(plastic rustling)

40:17.940 --> 40:21.171
(grunting softly)
(door opens)

40:24.920 --> 40:27.081
(coughs)

40:27.120 --> 40:28.451
(door closes)

40:34.930 --> 40:35.919
(coughs)

40:52.680 --> 40:55.114
He puts the vials in these
for transport.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.118
Probably got exposed then.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.617
How?

40:58.650 --> 41:00.481
Who knows?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.681
I told them over and over,

41:02.720 --> 41:04.927
the caps they're sending
don't look good to me.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.952
Threads could slip.

41:07.990 --> 41:10.151
(oven door closes)

41:10.200 --> 41:11.929
What are you doing?
Killing it.

41:11.970 --> 41:15.895
131 should do it,
but I'm not taking any chances.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.205
(coughs and wheezes)

41:43.830 --> 41:48.324
(blooping
and blasting sounds)
