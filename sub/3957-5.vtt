00:01.200 --> 00:03.433
Don't mention
Friday to anyone.

00:03.433 --> 00:06.466
- Why are you looking at me?
- I'm looking at everyone.

00:06.466 --> 00:09.566
Don't tell your brothers,
don't tell your sisters,

00:09.566 --> 00:11.933
don't even tell
knobheads from school.

00:11.933 --> 00:13.633
At the end of the day,
it's between us.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.800
<i>[Rae]</i>
<i>Whatever, Chop! Dear Diary,</i>

00:15.800 --> 00:19.333
<i>The fight for Finn's</i>
<i>delicious heart has begun.</i>

00:19.333 --> 00:21.866
<i>In the red corner, Chloe.</i>

00:21.866 --> 00:24.833
<i>Seen here, looking at Finn</i>
<i>like a black widow</i>

00:24.833 --> 00:29.866
<i>sizing up how much Gaviscon</i>
<i>she's gonna need</i>
<i>after eating him whole.</i>

00:29.866 --> 00:32.933
<i>In the blue corner, see me.</i>

00:32.933 --> 00:39.633
<i>Finn, so out of my league</i>
<i>that no one would ever</i>
<i>even suspect I liked him.</i>

00:39.633 --> 00:42.033
<i>Nay, loved him.</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:44.200
<i>But since we had had that</i>

00:44.200 --> 00:46.000
<i>amazing heart-to-heart</i>
<i>at the party,</i>

00:46.000 --> 00:49.533
<i>my odds have</i>
<i>shortened massively.</i>

00:49.533 --> 00:51.966
This Friday is
between the six of us.

00:51.966 --> 00:56.633
Put it in the vault people,
lock it in the fucking vault.

00:56.633 --> 01:01.400
<i>[Rae] We've even developed</i>
<i>a secret mode of communication.</i>

01:07.200 --> 01:10.066
<i>I had to use every ounce</i>
<i>of my will power</i>

01:10.066 --> 01:12.100
<i>not to move his hand</i>
<i>over just a few inches</i>

01:12.100 --> 01:15.200
<i>and ask him to write out</i>
<i>all of</i> War and Peace.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.433
[Chop]
Yeah, check out this bad ass.

01:17.433 --> 01:19.200
[door opens]

01:19.200 --> 01:23.566
Oh, my God. Hi, Rae.
Hi, Chloe. Hi, everyone.

01:23.566 --> 01:24.500
[all] Hi.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.500
Mum, what are you doing here?

01:27.500 --> 01:31.100
I'm booking the function room
for Saturday.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.500
Oh, Rae's friends,
this is my new husband, Karim.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.933
- Oh, hi.
- Congratulations.

01:36.933 --> 01:38.333
Pleased for meet you.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.033
We're getting
the marriage blessed

01:40.033 --> 01:42.033
and then we're gonna come here
and have the reception
afterwards.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.766
So, you're all invited,
of course.

01:43.766 --> 01:46.066
- [chuckles]
They're can't. They're busy...
- We're not busy at all!

01:46.066 --> 01:49.366
That is wonderful,
Mrs. Earl, congratulations.

01:49.366 --> 01:53.433
Thank you, Chloe. But, actually,
my name is Mrs. Bouchtat now.

01:53.433 --> 01:54.600
Oh, Bouchtat.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.600
Does that mean
your name is Rae Bouchtat?

01:57.600 --> 01:58.666
No, it doesn't.

01:58.666 --> 02:00.433
This is so exciting!

02:00.433 --> 02:04.000
We can use it as a wind down
session after the rave.

02:06.566 --> 02:08.166
What did you say?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.166
Nothing.

02:11.066 --> 02:13.500
Did she say rave?

02:14.533 --> 02:16.766
[theme song plays]

02:52.600 --> 02:55.533
How many calories a minute
does high intensity sex burn?

02:55.533 --> 02:58.066
- Eighteen.
- So how long would
I have to have sex

02:58.066 --> 03:00.000
to burn off
a six pack of Wagon Wheels?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.533
- Jammie or normal?
- Jammie.

03:01.533 --> 03:06.000
Jammie Wagon Wheels are 167 cal.
Six is 1,002.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.100
At 18 cals a minute,
just under an hour.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.433
Oooh. Maybe I should get
Dr. Nick to cancel his 1:00.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.300
Hand jobs are supposed to be
exhausting, too.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.666
I heard that you sometimes have
to change arms half way through.

03:17.666 --> 03:22.333
So what you're saying is I could
essentially sex myself thin?

03:22.333 --> 03:25.833
Well, you could eat
two roast dinners,
have sex for an hour,

03:25.833 --> 03:29.300
throw in a couple of hand jobs
and you'd actually be
in minus calories.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.933
Well, what is not to like?
Where do I sign?

03:31.933 --> 03:33.566
What date is it?

03:33.566 --> 03:35.766
It's Wednesday,
21st August 1996.

03:35.766 --> 03:38.133
<i>[Tix]</i>
<i>21st August 1996.</i>

03:39.700 --> 03:42.733
<i>Dear Diary,</i>
<i>I want to be more like Rae.</i>

03:42.733 --> 03:46.266
<i>Then my life would be</i>
<i>full of things like boys...</i>

03:48.400 --> 03:52.100
<i>...things like, how many</i>
<i>calories things contain</i>

03:52.100 --> 03:54.333
<i>and how to lose those calories.</i>

03:59.900 --> 04:02.666
[Dr. Nick] I want you to start
trying to drink at least
two of these a day.

04:02.666 --> 04:04.300
They taste like tar.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.766
Tix, your BMI has dropped again.
It's dropped significantly.

04:07.766 --> 04:11.766
You've become in danger
of falling very ill. OK?

04:11.766 --> 04:13.766
There's a risk of organ failure,
of heart problems,

04:13.766 --> 04:16.400
hormone problems,
problems with your brain...

04:17.833 --> 04:19.966
Angie says you've refused solids
for the last few days.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.800
I don't like people
watching me eat.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.333
You're on supervised eating,
Tix. It's her job
to watch you eat.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.400
If you don't start eating
in the next few days,

04:29.400 --> 04:30.766
if your weight
doesn't stabilize,

04:30.766 --> 04:33.300
I'm going to have to
put you on a tube feed, Tix.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.933
<i>I really, really don't</i>
<i>want to have to do that.</i>

04:38.933 --> 04:42.100
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

04:47.433 --> 04:50.366
So how have you been
since our last session?

04:52.766 --> 04:54.266
You scared?

04:57.700 --> 05:00.300
You have to let go, Tix.

05:01.433 --> 05:05.266
It's OK
to lose control... sometimes.

05:05.266 --> 05:06.566
You don't have to worry
all the time.

05:06.566 --> 05:09.066
You don't have to
count calories.

05:11.066 --> 05:14.600
Tell me something
that makes you feel good?

05:16.033 --> 05:18.000
Anything?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
Rae.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.166
[Kester]
Rae. Great.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.800
So supposing I set up a date.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.766
Between you and Rae for dinner.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.133
She'd like that. I'd like that.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.700
It'd have to be Rae though.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.000
Mm.

05:36.566 --> 05:38.966
[Mum] 'Cause I said no,
and that means no.

05:38.966 --> 05:43.400
[Rae] Everyone's going. It's not
like an illegal rave anyway.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.300
It's more like
a big dance event.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.000
You're not going.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.266
I know sometimes
I tell you to do things

05:49.266 --> 05:51.166
and you ignore me... right?

05:51.166 --> 05:53.766
Well, this isn't gonna be
one of those times.

05:53.766 --> 05:58.000
Anyway, what do you think
Kester would say if you told him
you were going to a rave?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.833
[Rae] He'd say, "Go for it."

05:59.833 --> 06:04.866
I know Kester,
and he would love the idea
of me enjoying myself

06:04.866 --> 06:06.433
because he's not
a complete ball-breaker.

06:06.433 --> 06:10.366
Thank you! I'm not deaf.
Right, how does it look?

06:18.100 --> 06:25.300
Oh, great. I look like a cross
between a profiterole
and a prolapsed colon.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.733
I love it.
I absolutely love it.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.133
Mm.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.633
[gasps]
What about this one?

06:37.633 --> 06:40.733
- It's too expensive.
- But, I love it.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.800
If everyone's going to be there
I have to look nice.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.700
Rae, when I say no to
something it doesn't
mean keep arguing.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.600
It means end of discussion.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.500
[sighs]

06:52.500 --> 06:55.733
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh, don't be so dramatic.

06:56.533 --> 07:00.400
[love song plays]

07:00.400 --> 07:03.766
<i>[Rae] You always wonder</i>
<i>what it would be like</i>
<i>to sit in front of</i>

07:03.766 --> 07:06.500
<i>a doctor and hear</i>
<i>the worst possible news.</i>

07:06.500 --> 07:09.800
<i>How you'd cope,</i>
<i>how you'd feel...</i>

07:09.800 --> 07:13.066
Rae... I'm afraid you're going
to have to stop
drinking alcohol.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.300
Why?!

07:14.300 --> 07:15.766
The meds
we switched you over to,

07:15.766 --> 07:17.533
some people feel very
nauseous if they drink on them.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.000
- Especially at first.
- So it's nothing serious?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.533
What?! I want to go back
to the old ones.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.666
No, I wasn't happy
with the SSRIs.

07:24.666 --> 07:26.033
You said yourself
that they made you feel drowsy.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.200
I'd rather feel drowsy
than feel sick.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.766
It's fine. She can just
give up the booze.

07:30.766 --> 07:33.033
- This is bullshit!
- Rae!

07:33.033 --> 07:35.400
[Dr. Nick] We can review your
meds in the next few weeks,

07:35.400 --> 07:38.166
but changing them
or stopping them now is
really not a good idea.

07:41.533 --> 07:45.200
Dr. Nick, I meant to say,
I got married last week.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.066
Oh, wow. Great. Congratulations.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.300
Are we alright?

07:50.466 --> 07:51.600
Yeah.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.600
[groans]

08:01.000 --> 08:04.833
<i>[Rae] When you're sick,</i>
<i>you don't belong</i>
<i>to yourself any more.</i>

08:04.833 --> 08:06.466
<i>You don't get a say.</i>

08:06.466 --> 08:10.733
<i>Every doctor is another parent,</i>
<i>every ward another classroom,</i>

<i>every pill another piece</i>
<i>of their bollocks</i>

08:28.633 --> 08:31.666
<i>So that was it,</i>
<i>no booze because of my pills</i>

08:31.666 --> 08:35.033
<i>and no rave because</i>
<i>of my cow bag of a mum.</i>

08:47.466 --> 08:51.366
<i>You never know,</i>
<i>maybe the rave would be shit.</i>

<i>The perfect opportunity</i>
<i>to lick the fillings</i>

Rae? What you thinking about?

09:11.366 --> 09:16.433
I was thinking... How I'm gonna
tell you that you smell of BO.

09:16.433 --> 09:19.000
I'm sure you will
find something to say.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.233

Oh, shit, there's Kendo.

- Who's Kendo?
- Some twat dealer
from Dalehead.

09:27.866 --> 09:30.066
- Do I look alright?
- What do you mean,
do you look alright?

09:30.066 --> 09:31.366
He's a scumbag.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.800
Alright, ladies?
Alright, Chopper?

09:37.800 --> 09:40.000
- Alright, Kendo?
- Tell your fucking brother

09:40.000 --> 09:42.500
I'm gonna smash his face
in when I see him, yeah!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.933
I'm only joking.
How is the cunt?

09:46.933 --> 09:51.133
- He's alright.
- You want some pills
for Friday?

09:51.133 --> 09:52.766
Yeah, yeah. Sounds good.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.433
Drop around tomorrow then
and I'll see what I can
do for you. Yeah?

09:57.166 --> 10:00.433
In a bit. See you later, girls.

10:04.866 --> 10:07.566
What are you getting drugs for?

10:07.566 --> 10:08.766
It's a rave, isn't it?

10:08.766 --> 10:10.866
Finn, can I get a ride
on the back of your scooter?

10:10.866 --> 10:12.533
Yeah, of course, no problem.

10:12.533 --> 10:15.500
There's room
for you all to go in one car.

- What are you talking about?
- I'm not going.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.633
- What?
- [Izzy] Why?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.400
Is it because of your mum?

10:23.766 --> 10:25.300
I'm not going
if Rae's not going.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.933
I'm not going

Rae... listen to everyone,
you've got to go.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.633
Rae, you're always being
reminded about how
sick you were.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.333
It's just making you worse.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.800
You even said yourself,
you're getting better.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.866
You and Finn are getting close.

10:59.866 --> 11:03.233
Yeah, he's a good laugh.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.200
Does he ever mention me?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.466
Dunno, really.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.766
What do you reckon he'd do
if I tried to kiss him?

11:10.766 --> 11:11.833
How should I know what he'd do?

11:11.833 --> 11:15.066
Can you imagine
sleeping with him?

11:15.066 --> 11:18.800
- I'd need a fucking bib.
- That's disgusting.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.233
That's what you said about
Jarvis Cocker last week so...

11:21.233 --> 11:23.266
- It's still disgusting.
- Well, you're disgusting.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.466
Right, I'm off. Rae, come over
to mine tomorrow if you want.

11:26.466 --> 11:27.466
Why?

11:27.466 --> 11:28.833
Uh, because I've got some really

11:28.833 --> 11:30.666
- crap reggae
I want to show you.
- [giggles]

11:30.666 --> 11:33.266
And you can give me
some personal hygiene tips.

11:33.266 --> 11:35.133
- Alright.
- Whoo!

11:40.766 --> 11:44.066
- [bell dings]
- <i>[Rae] Round one. To me...</i>

11:44.066 --> 11:48.600
Rachel. Come name.
Special bird for you.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.533
No, thanks.

11:49.533 --> 11:53.333
Oh, Rae, come
and name the bird.

11:54.466 --> 11:55.833
[groans]

11:55.833 --> 11:58.700
Ah...
What's the matter with you?

11:58.700 --> 12:01.133
You're not still in a mood,
are you, about the rave?

12:01.133 --> 12:05.033
I'd like to see Kester's face
if he thought I was letting you
go to a rave.

12:05.033 --> 12:07.700
Stop pretending
like you know him.

12:07.700 --> 12:11.000
I already told you,
he wants me to have a life.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.600
Are you gonna name
this bird or not?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
They might not even
like each other

12:15.600 --> 12:17.700
and you've got
them all cooped up together.

[Kester clears throat]
It's me.

29:45.666 --> 29:49.200
- What are you doing in here?
- Hiding.

29:49.200 --> 29:54.366
- Why? What you doing in here?
- Hiding.

29:54.366 --> 29:58.400
I thought you'd be getting ready
for your big date with Rae.

29:59.533 --> 30:04.100
I'm not going. Please don't try
and convince me to go.

30:05.700 --> 30:11.000
I once treated a young boy
of about seven-years-old,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.866
he used to pull down on his
testicles whenever he was upset.

30:13.866 --> 30:19.433
I mean really yank down.
It was truly eye-watering
to behold.

30:19.433 --> 30:23.933
Then one day I asked him
a difficult question...

30:23.933 --> 30:26.233
...and he pulled down
so hard upon them

30:26.233 --> 30:28.133
that he had to go to hospital.

30:28.833 --> 30:31.500
That's crazy.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.266
You'd be surprised
what lengths people will go

30:33.266 --> 30:38.533
to not to face what's real
and painful inside them.

30:38.533 --> 30:45.100
But that's what my job is,
I'm essentially a torturer.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.933
This is were you say
I'm not a torturer,

30:46.933 --> 30:48.866
that I'm actually quite lovely.

30:48.866 --> 30:52.866
My methods of torture
are asking you to trust people,

30:52.866 --> 30:55.000
asking you to lose control.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.266
But if I'd been treated the way
you'd been treated by people,

31:00.366 --> 31:02.000
I'd want to sit in a toilet

31:02.000 --> 31:04.300
and hide from the rest
of the world as well.

31:04.300 --> 31:07.266
You are sitting in a toilet.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.233
It's really quite nice,
actually.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.633

31:13.666 --> 31:18.133

I trust, Rae.
