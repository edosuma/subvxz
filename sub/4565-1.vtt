WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:11.343
If we're not doing
anything wrong until we
sneak onto the subway?

00:11.345 --> 00:14.346
- You think you're ready
to just walk by your parents?
- I think I'm ready.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.315
Let me see your face
as you walk by your parents.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.885
"why are you making
that face at us, riley?"

00:19.887 --> 00:22.354
Because I'm sneaking
onto the subway.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.822
- Out the window.
- Let's go.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.461
Daddy, what are you
doing here?

00:29.463 --> 00:32.598
Being smarter than me.
How come you're always
smarter than me?

00:33.833 --> 00:35.401
Here's what
I'm thinking.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.939
It's not your world yet.
It's still my world.

00:40.941 --> 00:44.510
Because if it was your world,
maya would have you on
the subway already,

00:44.512 --> 00:46.845
Thinking you put
something over on me.
But you didn't.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.348
Know how I know?
Look at ya.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.417
You're right here.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.220
How long do I have to live
in my father's world?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.289
Until you make it
yours.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.292
Riley, do you know what
I want more than anything?

01:00.294 --> 01:02.561
Go ahead,

01:02.563 --> 01:04.296
Make it yours.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.298
I will.
And when I do

01:06.300 --> 01:07.966
Will you still
be there for me?

01:07.968 --> 01:09.334
Topanga:
<i>Right here.</i>

01:11.304 --> 01:13.672
We'll be right here.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.343
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:25.584
<i>( busker drumming )</i>

01:29.289 --> 01:31.323
- Weasel!
- Maya!

01:31.325 --> 01:33.959
- Who's the new chick?
- "chick"!

01:33.961 --> 01:36.361
Down here I'm a chick.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.564
No wonder my parents don't
want me on the subway.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.368
- You're slouching, maya.
- Thanks, gretchen.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.605
<i>( drumming continues )</i>

01:51.644 --> 01:54.012
Whoa, riley.
You don't do lip gloss.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.281
Oh, what I forgot
to mention

01:56.283 --> 01:58.484
Is that I'm completely
reinventing myself.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.019
I ride the subway now,
I have kiwi lips now

02:01.021 --> 02:02.788
And I'm just as cool
as you now.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.657
Yeah?  Let's see
how cool you can be

02:05.659 --> 02:07.426
When you look at him.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.365
( giggles )

02:14.367 --> 02:16.368
Yeah, you're gonna need
some lessons.

02:16.370 --> 02:20.439
Okay, let me show you
everything you need to know
about boys and girls.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.877
Hi, I'm maya.
You're really cute.

02:24.879 --> 02:27.446
We should hang out sometime.
You make me happy.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.748
You don't pay
enough attention to me.
This isn't working out.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.351
It's you, not me.
We can still be friends.
Not really.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.657
He's available.
We just broke up.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.361
Are you okay?
Do we need to talk
about it?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.629
You still want
to be like me?

02:43.631 --> 02:46.732
I want to be
exactly like you.

02:46.734 --> 02:50.435
I think too much
and you don't
think at all.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.872
See, you get me.
So let's not think.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.641
( screams )

02:58.678 --> 03:00.512
Hi.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.048
We were just
talking about you.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.519
You used to go out
with my friend maya.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
I'm lucas.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.557
I love it.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.460
Perhaps someone would like
to give their seat

03:15.462 --> 03:17.729
To someone older?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.432
Oh, not you,
sweet potato pie.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.069
Please don't
make me move.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.438
I just want to see
where this goes.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.073
I've just worked
a 12-hour shift

03:28.075 --> 03:30.375
And I just want to see
where this goes.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.978
- Mmm-kay?
- Mmm-kay.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.616
- That was great.
- You're welcome.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.453
What if that was
the best moment
of my life?

03:41.455 --> 03:44.456
What if nothing ever
happens for me again?

03:45.592 --> 03:46.758
( screams )

03:50.597 --> 03:52.531
It's for you.

with the homework?
- Piece of cake.

- You didn't do it, did you?
- I don't even know where
my books are.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.597
They're here
and they're heavy.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.532
( bell rings )

05:01.701 --> 05:04.603
You have to do
the homework, maya.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.838
This teacher's insane,
a total nutjob.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.708
I think there's something
seriously wrong with him.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.811
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, daddy.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.613
You're late
to your father's class.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.781
Oh, don't worry,
mr. Matthews.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.215
- You wrote her a note.
- I did?

05:17.217 --> 05:18.583
- He did.
- You did.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.887
"riley is late.
Deal with it."

05:23.790 --> 05:25.791
Well, you got my signature down
pretty good this time.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.526
Oh, it was easy.
You write like a girl.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.797
Okay, let me get back
to jamming

05:31.799 --> 05:33.765
Some learning
into your heads.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.168
- The civil war.
- The civil bore.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.171
Thank you, future minimart
employee of the month.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.239
Would I be making
more money than you?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.710
The civil war!

05:44.712 --> 05:46.511
Anybody?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.780
A war we fought
against ourselves.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.683
- What, you actually studied it?
- No, I'm actually living it.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.521
People, people,
are we here to learn or not?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.989
What do you mean, farkle?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.758
I've been in love with riley
since the first grade.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.228
But I'm also equally
in love with maya.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.664
Some might say the great
mystery of the universe

06:05.666 --> 06:08.066
Is who's gonna be
the first mrs. Farkle.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.136
- You don't want this.
- Bring it on.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.307
I always thought
he'd wind up with
back-of-the-class brenda.

06:19.579 --> 06:21.546
Ew, yuck!

06:23.216 --> 06:24.816
Actually, the great mystery
of the universe

06:24.818 --> 06:26.184
Is how you could love
two women the same

06:26.186 --> 06:28.620
Who couldn't possibly
be more different.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.055
We're not so different.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.057
May I overstep
my bounds, sir?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.558
You always do.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.867
Riley is the sun,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.636
Warm and bright
and lights up my whole day.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.838
Maya is the night,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.807
Dark and mysterious.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.176
And the night has always been
a mystery to me.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.845
Because I go to bed
at 7:30.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.982
How could I love these
two different women?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.718
How could I not?
Thank you!  I am farkle!

07:02.321 --> 07:06.892
So we were indeed
trying to find out

07:06.894 --> 07:08.860
Who we were as a people.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.696
Who am I?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.031
What should I be?

07:13.033 --> 07:16.001
History shows that
bad things happen

07:16.003 --> 07:18.236
When you don't know
who you are.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.639
Who are you?
I don't know who you are.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.808
Subway boy.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.377
I'm lucas friar
from austin, texas.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.212
Oh, new student,
mr. Friar?

07:27.214 --> 07:30.315
- Yes sir.
- Great, you're just in time
for today's assignment.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.383
Have a seat.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.686
Okay, so we--

07:39.325 --> 07:42.127
So I'd like you guys
to open your books

07:42.129 --> 07:43.862
To page 48.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.265
Now I'd like you
to turn to page one.

07:48.334 --> 07:51.236
Now I'd like you to read
from page one to 48.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.706
- ( kids groan )
- oh, too bad on you.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.409
Okay, so for tonight's
assignment,

07:57.411 --> 08:01.480
I'd like you to write me
a three-page essay on anything--

08:01.482 --> 08:05.083
Anything at all that you guys
believe in so strongly

08:05.085 --> 08:08.253
- You'd fight for it.
- That!

08:08.255 --> 08:11.423
I come here every day.
Why can't you teach me

08:11.425 --> 08:13.225
Everything I need to know
while I'm here?

08:13.227 --> 08:14.726
Whoo!

08:15.661 --> 08:17.696
Not whoo.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.931
He gets our days.
Let's take back our nights.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.234
No homework, more freedom.
Who's with me?

08:22.236 --> 08:25.670
( chanting )
no homework, more freedom.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.940
No homework, more freedom.
No homework, more freedom...

08:28.942 --> 08:31.443
This is it, kid.
You want to be like me,

08:33.880 --> 08:35.747
No homework,
more freedom.

08:35.749 --> 08:41.319
- Whatcha doing?
- I'm making a choice
about who I want to be,

08:41.321 --> 08:43.288
About whose world
I want it to be.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.392
Riley, I know you.
You know exactly
who you are.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.462
- Who am I, dad?
- You're just like me.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.430
Yeah?
Would you do this?

08:52.432 --> 08:54.699
No homework, more freedom.

08:54.701 --> 08:59.271
Farkle, are you with us or not?
No homework, more freedom.

08:59.273 --> 09:03.341
- No homework, more freedom...
- My education or my women?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.744
My education
or my women?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.412
My education or my women?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.948
Oh, it's happening again, sir.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.957
<i>♪ I'm singing "go-o-o."</i>

09:18.959 --> 09:21.927
- Ma!
- Ma!

09:23.362 --> 09:25.430
Whatever this is,
do not put me in the middle

09:25.432 --> 09:28.333
Of the two people
that I love equally.
Just kidding, c'mere, honey.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.468
My teacher
followed me home.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.470
Can we keep him,
can we keep him?

09:32.472 --> 09:35.440
- Please say no!
- She walked out of my class.

09:35.442 --> 09:39.010
- She's trying to be maya.
- Why would you want to be maya?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.813
She's cool.
She has a wild side.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.949
She does
what she wants.

09:43.951 --> 09:47.285
- But you're such a good person.
- Who cares about that?

09:48.821 --> 09:50.855
Do you really think
I'm one of those girls

09:50.857 --> 09:53.858
Who follows
all of the rules and never
gets into trouble?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.460
I was hoping.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.495
You think
I'm well-raised.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.932
Half.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.974
How important is it that
you don't know me at all?

10:13.779 --> 10:15.547
"let's get married!"
"let's have a kid!"

10:15.549 --> 10:17.215
"let's have
another kid!"

10:17.217 --> 10:19.884
Well, you listened
to me, you big stupid!

10:21.954 --> 10:25.256
Am I the type of person
who always plays it safe?

10:25.258 --> 10:28.159
Is this who I'm going to be
for the rest of my life?

10:28.161 --> 10:31.296
Am I ever going to take a risk
that changes my destiny?

10:32.231 --> 10:34.332
Do birds know
how to smile?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.903
Why is cake always
so delicious?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.841
Will my drawings
ever get any better?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.477
Are you
making fun of me?

10:45.479 --> 10:49.147
No, I think just like you
because we're twins.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.520
- We're not twins.
- Ma-aaaa!

11:02.428 --> 11:05.063
Aww, look at him
looking for a place to fit in.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.465
Do you think
he'll sit with us?

11:11.237 --> 11:12.604
Ladies.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.973
Both:
Farkle!

11:14.975 --> 11:17.909
Interesting lunch-line dilemma:
Sloppy joe

11:17.911 --> 11:20.912
Or chicken pot pie?
Or sloppy joe?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.381
Or chicken pot pie?

11:23.383 --> 11:26.184
- Is that all you got?
- That's it.  Same time
tomorrow.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.921
There he is.
Invite him to sit down.

11:29.923 --> 11:34.426
- What do I say?
- "hey, lucas, looking
for somebody special?"

11:34.428 --> 11:37.395
- I can't say that.
- "hey, lucas, looking
for somebody?"

11:37.397 --> 11:39.364
- Too forward.
- "hey, lucas."

11:39.366 --> 11:41.199
- Like we're on
a first-name basis?
- "hey."

11:41.201 --> 11:42.934
- Hey.
- Hey back.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.639
Hi.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.641
You're sitting here.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.975
Is that okay?

11:53.646 --> 11:55.480
Can you excuse me
for just one sec?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.117
( squeals )

11:59.119 --> 12:00.652
How ya doing?

12:02.688 --> 12:05.924
Dad, you have a choice here.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.625
You can either understand
that this is just a boy

12:07.627 --> 12:09.494
Talking to me
in the cafeteria--

12:09.496 --> 12:11.629
I'm gonna do
whatever you say next.

12:11.631 --> 12:16.067
- But this is so innocent.
- Honey, fathers don't see
anything as innocent.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.903
We see it as...
What's the opposite
of innocent?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.305
Right here.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.007
Please don't
embarrass me.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.477
I'm just going to talk
to mr. Friar about
geography.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.612
You know, I've been
to a lot of places,

12:27.614 --> 12:32.517
- What part of texas
is closest to mexico?
- That'd be el paso, sir.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.953
Great.
Let's go right now.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.465
So... Did you do
the homework?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.601
No, I didn't do
the homework.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.437
The question on
everybody's kiwi lips is
did you do the homework?

12:52.439 --> 12:56.307
No.  I'm one
of the founding members
of the homework rebellion.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.043
You think
<i>I </i> did  <i>my </i> homework?

12:59.045 --> 13:02.013
- I think you did mine too.
- I did, I did and I really
liked it.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.716
Riley, don't save me.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.185
- What?
- Let me be me.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.289
Oh, you got
two desserts?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.691
- Angel's food cake.
- And devil's food cake.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.528
- Let me guess who's who.
- Hey, farkle's just hungry.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.163
Not everything is about you.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.605
- Hi, I'm glad you're back.
- Hi, me too.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.308
Hi.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.477
Apparently you have
a better sense of direction

13:32.479 --> 13:34.579
Than I anticipated.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.351
You are a really
good-looking guy.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.323
Okay, so...

13:45.325 --> 13:50.662
If anybody here believes
in something so strongly

13:50.664 --> 13:53.298
They'd fight for it.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.599
- Maya.
- Yes sir.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.201
- Present your homework.
- Can't do that, sir.

13:56.203 --> 14:00.038
-  <i>Why not?</i>
<i>- That's what</i>
<i>I'm fighting against, sir.</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:02.140
Oh, this could go on
for a while.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.276
Farkle farkle farkle farkle.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.411
( snores )

14:06.413 --> 14:08.146
Farkle
farkle farkle.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.051
- I didn't do
my homework either.
- Oh really?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.486
Yeah.
We're the same now.
I don't believe in homework.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.456
Guess what, riley?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.425
That doesn't make you
the same as maya at all.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.594
I have something to say.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.296
Wow, I don't know
what to do.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.397
I've never seen
this before.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.466
The floor is yours,
ms. Hart.

14:30.302 --> 14:33.037
Get up, farkle.
You're gonna want
to be awake for this.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.073
Is it our honeymoon?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.475
No, you missed that.
Now it's time to hand in
our essays.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.811
Oh, farkle goes first.
Farkle always goes first!

14:41.113 --> 14:42.480
All right, everybody
who did their homework,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.416
- Put it on your desks.
- Careful there, ms. Hart.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.652
- Are you sure about this?
- I got this.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.820
Okay.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.827
The burning of atlanta led
to the end of the civil war

14:55.829 --> 14:58.630
And to peace.
I believe that peace
is worth fighting for.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.166
Hey, that's a pivotal
part of my diorama!

15:03.135 --> 15:04.602
And there goes virginia.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.804
The burning
of the homework

15:06.806 --> 15:08.706
Led to the end
of the homework rebellion--

15:08.708 --> 15:11.709
Because there was
no more homework.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.711
All right, all right,
that's far enough, maya.
I get it.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.413
- No homework, more freedom!
- ( spurts )

15:15.415 --> 15:17.682
- ( screams )
-  <i>( alarm ringing )</i>

15:20.452 --> 15:23.354
Okay, so those work.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.357
Is this still part
of your presentation

15:26.359 --> 15:27.625
Or is this
actually going on?

15:31.630 --> 15:34.365
- Why didn't you
stop your friend?
- It's not what I do anymore.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.168
- You're better than that.
- I'm just letting her be her.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.480
Ms. Hart,
you have detention.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.483
The principal will determine
if it goes further than that.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.218
Ms. Matthews,
please leave.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.155
- I deserve detention too.
- No, you don't.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.258
You didn't do anything.
And because you didn't
do anything,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.560
Your best friend
is in very deep trouble.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.731
All right, farkle,

16:06.733 --> 16:08.533
You can get down now.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.501
Well, you're actually
quite comfortable, sir.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.303
Thank you, farkle.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.438
Get off!

16:13.440 --> 16:15.506
Farkle isn't
going anywhere!

16:26.552 --> 16:28.653
Down, farkle.

16:31.623 --> 16:34.759
You're looking at us
pretty hard there,
mr. Matthews.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.561
I just want
to stand by my girl.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.564
You missed the moment
to stand by your girl.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.667
You were so busy trying
to be her, riley,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.636
You forgot
the best thing you can
do for her is be you.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.773
Riley, take farkle
for a walk.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.682
Listen, for as long
as I can remember,

16:57.684 --> 17:00.918
It's always been
riley and maya.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.822
Now I always believed
a friend helps another
friend out of trouble,

17:04.824 --> 17:05.890
Not into it.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.828
- I'm sorry.
- I am too.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.697
Because you go too far.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.866
Do you understand me?

17:16.902 --> 17:18.836
I have nobody at home

17:18.838 --> 17:20.972
Who helps me
with my homework.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.622
- Riles?
- Yeah?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.425
If we can't hang out
with each other as much
anymore,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.660
- Don't worry about it.
- Wait.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.929
- Why wouldn't we--
- he's going to make you
end the friendship.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.798
He said that?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.933
He's really upset
with me.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.003
He loves you.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.238
I don't think so
anymore.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.908
I just want you to know
that I get it wouldn't
be your fault.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.678
( laughs )
beyootiful!

18:00.680 --> 18:03.881
You two little bumblebees
got a sweet thing going.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.917
But where's your hunk?

18:07.019 --> 18:10.788
You ain't got no hunk,
you ain't got no story!

18:10.790 --> 18:13.724
- I haven't been
your good friend.
- You're my best friend.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.495
She's your best friend!
Best friends are important.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.765
I got a best friend.
I'm not talking to her
right now.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.736
I go too far.
And I don't think
that's gonna stop.

18:25.738 --> 18:29.507
- I'm bad for you.
- Did he say that?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.576
He will.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.311
This is your stop.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.648
Don't be me.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.654
- You don't go as far as me.
- No.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.626
- No.
- No!

18:48.628 --> 18:51.329
Do not push her
off this train!

18:51.331 --> 18:54.899
<i>You do not push</i>
<i>your best friend</i>
<i>off the train.</i>

18:57.636 --> 18:59.070
I'm not you.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.945
That little girl
pushed those doors open

19:07.947 --> 19:09.814
With the power of love.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.417
You are not allowed
to abandon our friendship!

19:13.419 --> 19:15.386
I would never do that.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.989
Riley, I'm pushing you away
because I'm not good
for you anymore.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.458
Only I decide that!

19:20.460 --> 19:22.693
- You know why?
- Why?

19:22.695 --> 19:25.530
Because if this is
my world now,

19:25.532 --> 19:28.399
The first person
I want in it is you.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.102
You're gonna save me,
aren't you?

19:32.604 --> 19:34.505
I am.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.680
Where is he?

19:44.850 --> 19:48.352
There is no way
I'm gonna let you break-up
my friendship with maya!

19:49.488 --> 19:51.355
Is that what you think
I want, riley?

19:52.491 --> 19:55.426
No.  What you said
you really want

19:55.428 --> 19:57.628
Is for me to make
the world my own.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.665
And you want me
to do my homework.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.700
Well, I'm doing it
right now.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.871
Here's what I think
is worth fighting for:

20:06.873 --> 20:09.807
This is my best friend.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.043
She's gonna get me
into trouble

20:12.045 --> 20:13.811
And I'm gonna
get us out of it.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.616
And I did.
Because here we are.

20:18.618 --> 20:22.553
Look at us, dad.
We're right here.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.958
My civil war
is over, dad.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.125
I won.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.095
What happens now?

20:39.871 --> 20:41.939
Friends, family--

20:41.941 --> 20:45.409
And all you other
subterranean mole people--

20:45.411 --> 20:47.612
We're here today
to celebrate

20:47.614 --> 20:49.747
Riley being riley.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.818
Now some may call this
a new york city subway pass.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.488
But you, riley,
can consider this
a ticket to the world.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.491
- You think I'm ready?
- You showed us you are.

21:00.493 --> 21:04.895
Riley, I've already
met the world.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.564
It's your turn.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.702
Hey, this isn't
so different from texas.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.772
- Look, there's a pony.
- That's a rat.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.809
- Ladies.
- Farkle.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.150
So where do
you wanna go?

21:26.152 --> 21:28.519
Don't know.
Big world.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.622
- Ours now?
- Yeah, but my dad did say

21:31.624 --> 21:32.690
I have to be home
by 5:00.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.760
Don't worry,
he wrote you a note.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.500
Conductor:
<i>Next stop, astor place,</i>

21:42.502 --> 21:44.068
<i>14th street...</i>

21:44.070 --> 21:45.770
<i>And the world.</i>

21:50.776 --> 21:52.710
You guys came back
and waited for us?

21:52.712 --> 21:55.479
Hey, we told you we were
always gonna be here for you.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.847
Yeah, riley.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.616
It's not so easy
handing over the world

21:58.618 --> 22:01.118
Without making sure
everything's going
to be okay.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.825
Well done,
mr. Matthews.
