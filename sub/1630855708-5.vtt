- Hmm.

00:14.833 --> 00:15.875
(GRUNTS)

00:17.833 --> 00:19.625
I am the Watcher,

00:19.708 --> 00:22.416
your guide
through the vast realities of time.

00:23.708 --> 00:27.666
And today,
we bear witness to a monumental prophecy,

00:27.750 --> 00:29.083
about to be fulfilled.

00:29.750 --> 00:34.166
<i>Enshrined in this ancient temple,</i>
<i>is the last seed of Drez-Lar.</i>

00:34.541 --> 00:37.458
<i>Legend says the seed will emerge</i>
<i>from this hallowed ground</i>

00:37.541 --> 00:41.000
<i>and usher the universe</i>
<i>into a glorious new age.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:44.083
<i>But not without the help</i>
<i>of one of our bravest heroes.</i>

00:44.166 --> 00:45.833
- (RUMBLING)
<i>- An awe-inspiring champion</i>

00:45.916 --> 00:47.833
<i>known all throughout all the cosmos.</i>

00:48.125 --> 00:49.625
<i>He's the chosen one.</i>

00:49.708 --> 00:51.000
<i>He calls himself...</i>

00:51.666 --> 00:52.666
<i>Groot.</i>

00:52.750 --> 00:54.250
(BALL SQUEAKING)

00:54.416 --> 00:57.291
THE WATCHER: There's no telling
what perils the temple holds for Groot.

00:57.375 --> 00:58.416
He must tread lightly

00:58.500 --> 01:00.125
- for any wrong step can prove--
- Huh!

01:00.208 --> 01:02.291
- (RUMBLING)
- THE WATCHER: Oh! No, no, watch out!

01:02.375 --> 01:03.458
(ARROWS WHOOSHING)

01:04.291 --> 01:06.875
THE WATCHER: Wait.
Wait, are you doing that on purpose?

01:07.375 --> 01:09.416
I've never seen someone set off

01:09.500 --> 01:11.708
- literally every single trap.
- Ha-ha!

01:12.125 --> 01:15.166
THE WATCHER: How... I... I mean,
it's actually quite impressive.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.875
He's lived
through every obstacle, untouched.

01:17.958 --> 01:19.083
- (RUMBLING)
- Uh...

01:19.583 --> 01:20.666
That's not good.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.458
(RUMBLING)

01:23.750 --> 01:27.250
Oh, boy! Okay, that's, um... lava.

01:27.666 --> 01:30.333
Time is of the essence.
The seed is now in grave danger!

01:30.416 --> 01:32.000
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Groot must-- Groot! No, no, no.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.458
The seed is that way!

01:34.041 --> 01:35.041
That way!

01:35.416 --> 01:37.916
- I guess he's found the ancient mural.
- (EXCLAIMS)

01:38.000 --> 01:40.500
Groot must know innately
that there are secrets

01:40.583 --> 01:43.458
hidden in this mural
that will lead him to the safest path...

01:43.583 --> 01:44.958
- I am Groot.
- Don't draw on it!

01:45.041 --> 01:46.458
Where's the-- Where's he going?

01:46.833 --> 01:49.500
Okay, well, at least
he stopped defacing precious artif--

01:49.583 --> 01:51.041
(URINATING)

01:51.666 --> 01:53.291
- Never mind, this is worse.
- (GROOT HUMMING)

01:53.375 --> 01:55.291
THE WATCHER:
And now that he's relieved himself,

01:55.375 --> 01:57.291
he must be ready to resume his mission.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.583
The galaxy's greatest hope
has only minutes

01:59.666 --> 02:01.791
until it literally
goes up in flames and...

02:01.875 --> 02:03.416
- Can he see me?
- (GROOT BABBLING)

02:04.125 --> 02:06.125
THE WATCHER:
No, I'm a 5th-dimensional being.

02:06.583 --> 02:07.625
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

02:07.708 --> 02:10.125
Sorry, he's just putting on a little show.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.333
But the time has come.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.500
The fate of the universe--

02:12.583 --> 02:14.208
- What are you doing? Napping?
- (YAWNING)

02:14.291 --> 02:15.291
THE WATCHER: You can't nap.

02:15.375 --> 02:17.875
You are about to fulfill a prophecy
eons in the making

02:17.958 --> 02:21.166
and you're going to let it melt away
because you're tuckered out?

02:22.666 --> 02:24.916
No way. Godly rays of light?

02:25.583 --> 02:26.750
This is classic.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.708
Okay. Contain your excitement.

02:29.791 --> 02:31.916
The prophecy's coming true. There he goes.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.791
Facing the danger without fear,
he's going for the seed,

02:34.875 --> 02:37.875
about to deliver peace and happiness
to the entire universe--

02:37.958 --> 02:39.750
- (EXCLAIMS)
- THE WATCHER: The ball?

02:40.375 --> 02:43.666
You just wanted the ball?
What's that thing cost, a quarter unit?

02:43.750 --> 02:45.750
Groot, you have to focus-- No!

02:45.833 --> 02:49.208
No, there it goes!
This universe-- This universe is doomed!

02:49.333 --> 02:50.541
Oh, I am Groot.

02:50.708 --> 02:52.375
Sorry kid. You're on your own.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.875
I am the Watcher,
but I can't watch this.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.583
(RUMBLING)

03:00.958 --> 03:02.583
No. No, no, no.

03:02.958 --> 03:05.291
This can't be right.
The prophecy was so clear.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.500
It said the seed,

03:06.583 --> 03:10.500
this small vessel of great potential
would sprout from this very place.

03:10.708 --> 03:12.541
Spreading peace and joy throughout--

03:12.958 --> 03:15.458
- And the seed...
- (YAWNS)

03:15.708 --> 03:17.916
THE WATCHER:
...is a metaphor, isn't it? (CHUCKLES)

03:18.000 --> 03:20.666
Okay. This is what I get
for skimming the prophecy.

03:20.750 --> 03:21.750
(BALL SQUEAKING)

03:21.833 --> 03:23.583
THE WATCHER:
Go forth, you little seedling.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.000
I know you'll make us proud.

03:29.791 --> 03:31.000
How does he keep doing that?
