WEBVTT

00:00.147 --> 00:01.694
We're gonna have to figure out
a way to get up there,

00:02.044 --> 00:03.417
blow that
son of a bitch up.

00:03.441 --> 00:04.488
We do have a Beamer.

00:04.512 --> 00:05.949
A buried Beamer.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.064
So, let's unbury it.

00:09.653 --> 00:11.174
We were wrong
about everything.

00:12.328 --> 00:13.392
She's on their side.

00:13.416 --> 00:15.609
***

00:16.667 --> 00:17.667
Those spikes of yours --

00:17.691 --> 00:18.932
they help you heal quickly,
right?

00:18.956 --> 00:20.146
Yeah.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.287
Ugh! Oh, oh!

00:21.311 --> 00:22.632
This is not evolution.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.031
This is genocide!

00:24.055 --> 00:25.512
Soon I'll be leaving
for my training,

00:25.536 --> 00:26.839
but I want you
to come with me.

00:27.267 --> 00:28.746
The Lexi we know
is gone.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.013 --> 00:39.914
You're back.

00:40.803 --> 00:42.625
Wanted to show you
what you've done...

00:43.675 --> 00:45.676
...and to thank you
in person.

00:47.479 --> 00:48.780
You did this!

00:48.814 --> 00:50.314
Look at me!

00:50.382 --> 00:52.283
Lexi,
look what you've done!

01:19.311 --> 01:20.812
What's he doing --
delivering a baby?

01:20.846 --> 01:22.613
Well, we learned
how to start the car.

01:22.648 --> 01:24.849
Now we got to figure out
how to drive the damn thing.

01:24.883 --> 01:26.651
Ah, forget it.

01:26.685 --> 01:29.453
Been looking all over this damn
ship for the steering mechanism.

01:29.521 --> 01:30.822
Can't even find
the damn yoke.

01:30.856 --> 01:32.323
Perhaps there
isn't one.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.394
We know that Beamers are remote
controlled by radio waves.

01:36.461 --> 01:37.728
They're drones.

01:37.763 --> 01:39.730
We must somehow override
the remote control

01:39.765 --> 01:41.933
and take local dominion
of the navigation system.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.702
How do we do that if there's
no yoke, no steering wheel?

01:44.736 --> 01:47.371
Come.
Allow me to show you something.

01:49.675 --> 01:52.743
Hey, don't touch anything.
It's dangerous.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.245
You guys
are touching stuff.

01:54.279 --> 01:56.247
Well, we're trying to
figure out how to fly it.

01:56.281 --> 01:58.249
So am I.

02:00.319 --> 02:02.486
When did you enter
your teenage rebellion phase?

02:02.521 --> 02:04.655
When I became a teenager.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.691
This ship stung the crap
out of my arm, and it hurt.

02:06.725 --> 02:08.658
I'm just trying to give you
a little bit of advice.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.394
I don't need advice.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.663
Okay.
Good talk.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.608
What am I looking at?
Find the Moon.

02:23.642 --> 02:26.377
Look 5 degrees below it.

02:28.914 --> 02:30.681
A whole line of Beamers.

02:30.749 --> 02:33.417
They are following the homing
beacon to the Espheni base.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.388
Perhaps I can use
the sub communicator

02:37.422 --> 02:39.557
to mimic the Espheni
homing beacon

02:39.591 --> 02:41.711
and trick the ship into flying
to the Moon on its own.

02:41.727 --> 02:44.462
You think you can hack into the drone
and just go along for the ride?

02:44.496 --> 02:46.297
We don't even need to find
the steering wheel.

02:46.310 --> 02:47.064
Precisely.

02:47.065 --> 02:49.867
You think you can hack into it?
The Volm have infiltrated

02:49.935 --> 02:53.037
and taken control of automated
Espheni ships before.

02:53.071 --> 02:55.439
I will give it
one chance in three.

02:55.474 --> 02:56.874
All right.

03:45.624 --> 03:48.492
Where's Matt?
He must've gone back in.

03:48.527 --> 03:49.880
If he's still alive,
I'm gonna kill him.

03:49.904 --> 03:51.595
Hey, he's 13 years old.

03:51.596 --> 03:54.665
Remember, we would've done
the same thing. Go easy on him.

03:56.401 --> 03:59.337
Hey! I thought I told you
not to touch anything!

03:59.404 --> 04:00.738
Why do you have
to always be so mad?

04:00.772 --> 04:02.373
Look.
I figured something out.

04:02.407 --> 04:04.075
What is this, Matt?
What'd you do?

04:04.142 --> 04:06.711
Pushed one of the lights under
the stairs and the hatch popped open.

04:06.745 --> 04:09.347
Which tendrils did you touch
to make the ship move?

04:09.381 --> 04:10.481
Look.

04:10.549 --> 04:12.416
This one and that one.

04:12.451 --> 04:14.685
You pull this, and the wings move?
Yeah.

04:14.753 --> 04:16.853
Pitch.

04:16.887 --> 04:19.055
Yaw must be nearby.
The two controls are integrated.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.992
See how the tendrils
come together at the trunk here.

04:21.026 --> 04:23.427
See, dad? Now we know
how to control pitch.

04:23.462 --> 04:25.830
Sometimes the Espheni

04:25.897 --> 04:28.132
try to hide
their communication channels

04:28.166 --> 04:30.001
- in the terrestrial spectrum.
- Right.

04:31.837 --> 04:33.471
Wait. What was that?

04:33.505 --> 04:35.473
Everybody hear that?

04:39.978 --> 04:42.079
Did you guys hear that?
Go back.

04:42.114 --> 04:44.648
Is that Spanish?

04:44.716 --> 04:47.184
<i>Hablo español.</i>
Anthony, what's he saying?

04:55.727 --> 04:59.663
<i>What is the most pervasive</i>
<i>force in the universe?</i>

04:59.731 --> 05:03.868
Gravity -- the attraction
of a body to another body.

05:03.935 --> 05:07.805
It's what makes the planets
go around the suns.

05:10.742 --> 05:13.010
It's what makes the stars.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.880
<i>And you have been born</i>
<i>with the unique ability</i>

05:15.914 --> 05:17.815
<i>to use gravity</i>
<i>and other natural forces,</i>

05:17.849 --> 05:19.550
<i>to control them.</i>

05:19.584 --> 05:23.187
<i>As you develop your power,</i>
<i>you will do amazing things.</i>

05:23.221 --> 05:25.489
<i>Do you see those trees</i>
<i>in the distance?</i>

05:25.524 --> 05:28.225
<i>The tall one.</i>
The big, live oak.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.194
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to break the chains of gravity</i>

05:30.262 --> 05:31.962
<i>that hold it together.</i>

05:31.997 --> 05:34.632
I don't want to destroy it.
<i>You aren't destroying it.</i>

05:34.666 --> 05:38.169
<i>You are setting it free,</i>
<i>sending it back to the stars.</i>

05:38.203 --> 05:41.138
<i>You are</i>
<i>the bringer of peace.</i>

05:41.206 --> 05:43.607
<i>Can you feel</i>
<i>every atom of the tree</i>

05:43.642 --> 05:45.476
<i>pulling on</i>
<i>every other atom,</i>

05:45.510 --> 05:47.912
<i>and all the other atoms</i>
<i>in the world</i>

05:47.979 --> 05:49.647
<i>pulling on those atoms?</i>

05:49.681 --> 05:52.983
<i>That is the eternal tug-of-war</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

05:53.018 --> 05:54.618
<i>I want you to take</i>

05:54.653 --> 05:57.588
<i>all that relentless static</i>
<i>background power</i>

05:57.656 --> 05:59.924
<i>and reverse it.</i>

05:59.958 --> 06:03.094
<i>Turn the pull</i>
<i>into a push.</i>

06:06.565 --> 06:10.835
<i>Use the light</i>
<i>in your mind.</i>

06:37.929 --> 06:39.563
<i>Singularly gifted.</i>

06:39.598 --> 06:41.065
I can't breathe.

06:41.099 --> 06:42.800
<i>Rest.</i>

06:42.834 --> 06:46.537
<i>Your strength will come back,</i>
<i>stronger next time.</i>

06:55.981 --> 06:57.715
How strong can I get?

06:57.749 --> 07:00.050
<i>It depends on how disciplined</i>
<i>you are in your training.</i>

07:00.085 --> 07:03.020
<i>Your potential</i>
<i>is unlimited.</i>

07:03.054 --> 07:05.189
Could I make a star?

07:05.223 --> 07:09.560
<i>Your perfected power</i>
<i>will be...Divine.</i>

07:16.701 --> 07:19.236
We received a radio transmission
from inside the Beamer.

07:19.271 --> 07:23.274
Yeah, it was a loop --
the same message over and over.

07:23.308 --> 07:26.744
"The ghettos
are being emptied.

07:26.778 --> 07:29.613
"Almost no one is left
in Andalusia.

07:29.648 --> 07:32.049
"It is the same
in Italy and Morocco.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.553
"Virtually everyone
has been taken for processing.

07:35.587 --> 07:39.557
"The enemy has a new weapon
to capture human fugitives.

07:39.591 --> 07:42.693
"I've seen it.
It's horrific,

07:42.761 --> 07:45.162
"beyond anything
we have encountered before.

07:45.197 --> 07:48.699
"Believe me when I say
there is no defense.

07:48.733 --> 07:51.635
"Anyone hearing this
should realize

07:51.670 --> 07:55.639
"you are one of the last
remaining pockets of humanity.

07:55.674 --> 07:57.274
"Do not attempt to fight back.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.643
"Go to ground...

07:59.678 --> 08:01.278
"Retreat...

08:01.313 --> 08:02.913
"Hide...

08:02.948 --> 08:04.915
"Survive...

08:04.950 --> 08:06.917
Or this is the end."

08:09.957 --> 08:13.698
How do we know this is real,
not just another Espheni trick?

08:13.699 --> 08:15.700
We don't. But it was broadcast
on a frequency

08:15.734 --> 08:17.068
that we think was ours.

08:17.102 --> 08:18.603
What frequency is that?

08:18.637 --> 08:22.073
1776 megahertz,
as in American independence.

08:22.107 --> 08:24.809
Somebody's looking out for us,
hoping we'd get the code.

08:24.843 --> 08:26.578
So, what are we gonna do?

08:26.612 --> 08:28.947
Those voices said we need
to retreat, hide, survive.

08:28.981 --> 08:30.281
We're kind of running out
of places to do that.

08:30.316 --> 08:31.916
We just gonna leave here?

08:31.951 --> 08:33.751
Yeah, we're gonna go liberate
another ghetto,

08:33.785 --> 08:36.020
get some people out of there before --
Before what?

08:36.087 --> 08:38.155
The Espheni solution
is happening.

08:38.190 --> 08:39.691
I've seen it for myself.

08:39.758 --> 08:41.759
Well, it sounds like
yet another

08:41.794 --> 08:43.861
"hold down the fort" detail
to me,

08:43.929 --> 08:45.997
and I, for one,
have no intention

08:46.031 --> 08:49.601
of playing
the sitting-duck card again.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.135
Maggie's right,
all right?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.338
What's wrong with rounding up
some new recruits, huh?

08:53.372 --> 08:55.206
We replenish the army,
we get out there,

08:55.274 --> 08:57.642
and we frag those cockroaches, huh?

08:57.676 --> 08:59.577
'Cause if that broadcast
is telling the truth

08:59.645 --> 09:01.379
and this mutation process
is that far along,

09:01.413 --> 09:03.848
we need to do something
even more aggressive than that.

09:03.882 --> 09:05.316
Sorry, I forgot
your master plan --

09:05.351 --> 09:07.085
hijack the, uh,
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> out thee

09:07.152 --> 09:08.319
and fly it to the Moon.

09:08.354 --> 09:10.655
Pope, shut up.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.024
Haven't heard a better plan yet.
Not out of you, anyway.

09:14.126 --> 09:16.828
We can't win a war of attrition.
We don't have the numbers.

09:16.862 --> 09:19.297
What we are about to embark on

09:19.331 --> 09:21.399
may not be the most rational
plan, but I do believe

09:21.433 --> 09:24.035
that it is the plan
with the best chance of success.

09:24.069 --> 09:27.071
If we've run out of time,
maybe this is too desperate.

09:27.106 --> 09:29.273
Maybe we <i>should</i>
just hide.

09:32.011 --> 09:34.078
Okay, I'm just gonna speak
for myself. I'm not gonna hide.

09:34.113 --> 09:37.048
I'm sick of scrounging around
and just surviving.

09:39.418 --> 09:41.219
I'm sure we could find a cave,
and we could eke out

09:41.253 --> 09:42.820
another week or another month,
another year,

09:42.855 --> 09:45.056
but that --
I want to win the war.

09:45.090 --> 09:48.026
And if there's a way --
if there is any way

09:48.093 --> 09:51.029
that we can cripple
the Espheni power core,

09:51.063 --> 09:53.665
we can bring down
their war defenses,

09:53.699 --> 09:55.433
then that's
what I'm gonna do.

10:00.806 --> 10:03.307
Tom's right.
This is no way to live.

10:06.278 --> 10:09.914
And exactly who do you propose
would be foolish enough

10:09.948 --> 10:13.951
to pilot that flying saucer
to the Moon?

10:13.986 --> 10:16.821
Me.

10:21.226 --> 10:23.795
I just think you're being rash.
You're treating this situation

10:23.829 --> 10:25.663
by rote,
if it's just another --

10:25.698 --> 10:27.265
There's nothing rote
about it.

10:27.299 --> 10:29.233
I'm the one driving the plan.
I have to walk the walk.

10:29.268 --> 10:30.401
And I'm glad you are.

10:30.436 --> 10:32.236
Everyone is.
But?

10:32.271 --> 10:33.971
But you can't make
another unilateral decision

10:34.006 --> 10:35.873
just because it's the shortest
distance between two points.

10:35.908 --> 10:37.809
There are no good options
here.

10:37.843 --> 10:39.711
I mean, I see that,
and I know that you're worried.

10:39.745 --> 10:41.345
It's more than
that I'm just worried.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.115
I mean, you are flying on an alien
spaceship to the Moon, Tom.

10:44.149 --> 10:45.783
A-and just think about it.

10:45.851 --> 10:47.919
Once you destroy
the power core,

10:47.953 --> 10:50.121
doesn't that kill
everything Espheni-powered?

10:50.155 --> 10:52.990
How the hell are you planning
on getting back, exactly?

10:53.025 --> 10:54.759
Cochise
has done his homework.

10:54.827 --> 10:57.462
He says there should be enough
stored power in the Beamer

10:57.496 --> 11:00.231
to fly it home, in a --
like, a battery or something.

11:00.299 --> 11:02.300
Oh. Well, that's --
that's reassuring.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.402
Okay, well, once
the Espheni here on earth

11:04.436 --> 11:06.370
realize
that they've been hit hard,

11:06.405 --> 11:08.473
you think
they're not gonna retaliate?

11:08.540 --> 11:09.995
And don't you think we need you
here alive when they do?

11:09.996 --> 11:11.743
It's a two-man job.

11:11.744 --> 11:14.078
Cochise pilots,
and I have to deploy the bombs.

11:14.113 --> 11:16.214
Hey, but I can't ask
somebody else to do this.

11:16.248 --> 11:18.082
And I need to lead
by example.

11:18.117 --> 11:20.718
I want you to lead, but with
the consent of those you're leading.

11:20.786 --> 11:22.720
Tom, you've got
to think it through

11:22.788 --> 11:25.923
and allow the people around you
to think it through <i>with</i> you.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.126
That is the only way
we pull this off --

11:28.160 --> 11:30.461
if we decide things
together.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.301
I hear what you're saying,
I really do,

11:37.336 --> 11:40.004
and I know you're not just
talking about the group.

11:41.807 --> 11:45.109
We are --
We are partners now.

11:45.144 --> 11:47.011
Yeah.
You got me?

11:47.045 --> 11:50.081
Yeah, I got you.
I do.

11:50.115 --> 11:51.315
Okay.

11:53.418 --> 11:55.019
Uh, excuse me.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.955
It's okay. What's up?
We need you at the Beamer.

12:00.826 --> 12:01.993
Thank you.

12:05.063 --> 12:07.131
We were working,
and all of a sudden,

12:07.199 --> 12:08.933
these tendrils lurched
out of the Beamer console

12:08.967 --> 12:11.102
and seized
the Volm communicator.

12:11.136 --> 12:12.049
And fried it.

12:12.073 --> 12:14.038
It is because we integrated
the Volm technology

12:14.039 --> 12:16.474
in order to access
the ship's navigation system.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.944
Apparently, this Beamer is armed
with a defense mechanism

12:20.012 --> 12:22.113
which recognized
the Volm override.

12:22.181 --> 12:24.248
Once this ship
is fully activated,

12:24.283 --> 12:27.018
I worry it will recognize
<i>any</i> Volm presence

12:27.052 --> 12:28.452
and will reject me.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.855
You're saying
you can't go on the mission?

12:30.889 --> 12:32.089
I could, but...

12:32.124 --> 12:34.358
It would jeopardize
our objective.

12:34.426 --> 12:37.128
So, the only one of us
who has any understanding

12:37.196 --> 12:39.363
of how this thing works
is grounded.

12:39.398 --> 12:42.867
So much for hitching a ride.

12:45.304 --> 12:49.273
There is...one possibility.

12:49.308 --> 12:52.410
If we can manage
to fly this Beamer manually

12:52.444 --> 12:54.545
above the interference
of earth's atmosphere,

12:54.580 --> 12:56.981
there is a chance
it will automatically lock onto

12:57.015 --> 12:59.350
the homing beacon
to the Espheni power core.

12:59.384 --> 13:02.420
And then fly itself to the Moon?
Yes.

13:02.454 --> 13:05.022
So it's not a magic carpet,
it's an airplane?

13:05.057 --> 13:06.858
Mm.

13:06.892 --> 13:08.125
Airplanes have
four basic controls --

13:08.160 --> 13:09.827
thrust, pitch, yaw, roll.

13:09.895 --> 13:13.064
And we already know pitch
and yaw, thanks to your son.

13:14.466 --> 13:17.134
And we know where the main
control panel is, thanks to your son.

13:18.403 --> 13:22.039
So, then, all we need to isolate
is thrust and roll...

13:22.074 --> 13:23.341
The old-fashioned way.

13:26.278 --> 13:28.546
Pull!

13:28.580 --> 13:30.381
Nothing.

13:33.018 --> 13:34.085
Pull!

13:34.119 --> 13:35.219
Nothing.

13:36.889 --> 13:38.089
Pull!

13:40.125 --> 13:41.592
Stop! Stop! Stop!

13:41.627 --> 13:44.562
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:44.630 --> 13:47.298
Cochise nearly
got sucked through the intake.

13:47.366 --> 13:49.400
Thrust.

13:50.502 --> 13:51.969
Pull.

13:58.043 --> 14:00.278
How's the bomb coming?

14:04.316 --> 14:06.951
I said, um,
how's the bomb coming?

14:06.985 --> 14:10.087
Well, if we can't figure out a
way to control this accelerant,

14:10.122 --> 14:12.356
it's gonna be hard
to time the explosion.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.261
Look, um...

14:17.296 --> 14:20.331
I know
I crossed the line.

14:20.365 --> 14:21.666
And what line is that --

14:21.733 --> 14:23.434
the line you don't cross

14:23.468 --> 14:27.038
when you're hitting on
your brother's girlfriend?

14:27.072 --> 14:29.640
You have to understand, it --
we couldn't help it.

14:29.675 --> 14:32.043
S-something's going on
with the spikes.

14:32.077 --> 14:35.513
Spikes. Right.

14:35.547 --> 14:37.381
How do you know
you don't just like her?

14:37.449 --> 14:40.384
I wouldn't have done anything
with Maggie if it wasn't...

14:40.419 --> 14:41.552
You're my brother, Hal.

14:41.586 --> 14:43.220
I'd n-never do anything
to hurt you.

14:46.058 --> 14:48.492
That's easy to say,
isn't it?

14:58.337 --> 15:03.107
We haven't isolated the roll
mechanism just yet, but we will.

15:03.141 --> 15:04.408
There are so many options.

15:04.443 --> 15:06.210
When can we take it
for a test drive?

15:06.244 --> 15:08.446
I doubt we'll be able to take it
for a test drive before --

15:08.480 --> 15:10.982
Well, remember, we don't have
to land on a Navy carrier.

15:11.016 --> 15:13.217
I mean, all we have to do
is fly up.

15:13.285 --> 15:14.618
The sky
is literally the target.

15:14.653 --> 15:16.620
According to
Cochise's diagnostics,

15:16.655 --> 15:18.222
once in space,

15:18.256 --> 15:20.658
the Beamer will lock onto
the Espheni homing beacon

15:20.692 --> 15:22.593
and fly to the Moon base
on its own.

15:22.627 --> 15:24.261
We still need
to train with it.

15:24.296 --> 15:25.612
I mean, it's gonna take
two people to drop the bomb.

15:25.613 --> 15:26.145
I can pilot it --

15:26.169 --> 15:28.169
Whoa. Uh, has that been
decided yet, partner?

15:28.734 --> 15:31.035
Of course it has.
He's a glory hog.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.637
Hold on.
I realize it's not about that.

15:33.672 --> 15:35.272
But, Tom...

15:35.307 --> 15:38.042
This task is unique,
to say the least.

15:38.076 --> 15:41.545
It's not just another
rescue mission or weapons grab.

15:41.613 --> 15:43.514
This is for all the marbles.

15:43.548 --> 15:45.016
Shouldn't there be...

15:45.083 --> 15:47.518
A fair process
to determine how it works?

15:47.552 --> 15:49.286
Sounds good.

15:49.321 --> 15:51.322
I agree.

15:51.356 --> 15:53.691
We should draw straws
to be fair.

15:53.725 --> 15:55.159
- Good idea.
- Out of the mouths of babes.

15:55.193 --> 15:58.129
Sounds like
a good idea to me.

15:58.163 --> 16:01.098
Draw straws?
Are you joking?

16:01.166 --> 16:02.500
This isn't a game.

16:02.534 --> 16:04.254
We should pick
the right person for the job.

16:04.269 --> 16:07.338
Exactly who said that you were
the best person for the job?

16:08.573 --> 16:12.143
I have 13 registered hours
as a pilot. Do you?

16:12.177 --> 16:13.644
- I like it.
- Sounds pretty good.

16:13.678 --> 16:15.012
I want to take a shot.
You got something --

16:15.080 --> 16:16.781
Hey...
I want to do it.

16:16.815 --> 16:18.482
...I don't think any of this
should be left to chance.

16:18.550 --> 16:20.484
Then you can vote
against the draw.

16:20.552 --> 16:22.753
Who's for it?

16:33.532 --> 16:35.266
Okay, we'll draw straws.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.234
It's a very dangerous
mission.

16:37.269 --> 16:39.804
Nobody should be forced to go.
Draw should be voluntary.

16:39.838 --> 16:42.473
I tell you what --
think very carefully

16:42.507 --> 16:44.442
whether or not
you want to volunteer.

16:44.509 --> 16:49.180
If you do
come back later.

16:49.247 --> 16:51.515
We'll get pen, paper.

16:51.550 --> 16:54.085
Write your names out. Put them
in here. Come back tonight.

16:54.119 --> 16:57.521
We'll pull out the names,
find out who got lucky.

17:11.881 --> 17:13.882
I'm proud of you.
For what?

17:13.915 --> 17:16.984
For going with the draw.
It was very democratic of you.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.621
I also think
it got everyone more invested.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.189
I already
put my name in.

17:25.161 --> 17:27.128
I think
it's a horrible idea.

17:27.163 --> 17:28.930
I think we should go
with the person

17:28.965 --> 17:31.066
who's got the most chance of success...
Meaning you.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.201
...not just pick people
at random.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.170
By the way, what happens
if Hal or Ben gets picked?

17:35.204 --> 17:37.839
I would hate that,
but we can't make exceptions

17:37.874 --> 17:39.774
just because --
Because they're my children?

17:39.842 --> 17:41.710
Aren't we all
a family now?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.649
Yeah.
I'm sorry I said that.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.784
Look, you're gonna
accept the results, right?

17:49.819 --> 17:52.120
You're not gonna pull rank if
you don't like who gets decided?

17:52.155 --> 17:54.289
I honestly don't know
how I would react

17:54.323 --> 17:57.192
if one of the boys gets picked.
I'm on your side.

17:57.226 --> 17:59.161
You're not the only one
who can save the world, Tom.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.062
I want to put my name
in the draw.

18:01.097 --> 18:04.266
No. You're 13.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.368
You said Joan of Arc was a teenager when
she wanted to fight for her country.

18:06.402 --> 18:09.004
Don't get smart with me right now, please.
The draw was my idea!

18:09.038 --> 18:10.238
Yeah, I know,
but you have to be 15

18:10.273 --> 18:11.873
to pilot an alien spaceship,

18:11.908 --> 18:13.041
and you don't have
your learner's permit yet.

18:13.109 --> 18:15.343
God!
End of discussion.

18:19.982 --> 18:23.752
Worried about that kid.

18:38.434 --> 18:41.169
<i>You wanted to discuss</i>
<i>the hybrid, brother.</i>

18:41.204 --> 18:44.306
<i>I'm worried you won't be able</i>
<i>to control her for much longer.</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:47.175
<i>Don't be. She's completely</i>
<i>committed to our cause.</i>

18:47.210 --> 18:50.045
<i> She's completely</i>
<i>committed to our cause.</i>

19:05.027 --> 19:07.128
<i>She's more human</i>
<i>than Espheni.</i>

19:07.163 --> 19:10.732
<i>She sees humanity as inferior,</i>
<i>as she has been taught.</i>

19:10.766 --> 19:13.101
<i>You saw what she dd</i>
<i>to the forest.</i>

19:13.135 --> 19:15.470
<i>That's the reason</i>
<i>I summoned you.</i>

19:15.504 --> 19:17.472
<i>She's progressing</i>
<i>much more quickly</i>

19:17.506 --> 19:19.140
<i>than I could've imagine.</i>

19:19.175 --> 19:21.710
<i>She could single-handedy</i>
<i>win us the war.</i>

19:21.744 --> 19:23.712
<i>Or lose it</i>
<i>if she rebels.</i>

19:23.746 --> 19:25.847
<i>She's not going to rebel.</i>

19:25.881 --> 19:27.449
<i>And even if she did,</i>

19:27.516 --> 19:29.951
<i>I have a special means</i>
<i>to control her.</i>

19:29.986 --> 19:33.755
<i>Trust me -- she has no Ida</i>
<i>of our purpose for her.</i>

19:33.789 --> 19:36.725
<i>She thinks her power</i>
<i>is being developed for peace.</i>

19:36.759 --> 19:38.927
<i>I don't care.</i>
<i>End it.</i>

19:38.961 --> 19:41.997
<i>I want you to eliminate</i>
<i>the risk she represents.</i>

19:42.031 --> 19:43.798
<i>You want me to kill he?</i>

19:46.502 --> 19:48.770
<i>That's the safest</i>
<i>course of action.</i>

19:48.804 --> 19:51.139
<i>Now do as I say.</i>
<i>End her.</i>

19:52.575 --> 19:54.576
<i>Yes, brother.</i>

20:22.438 --> 20:26.074
I saw you put your name
in the draw when I put mine in.

20:26.108 --> 20:28.410
It's the right thing
to do.

20:28.444 --> 20:29.844
What do you mean?

20:31.047 --> 20:32.881
Just that.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.417
I try to do
the right thing...

20:35.451 --> 20:38.186
For my family...

20:38.254 --> 20:39.554
The people I care about.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.190
So do I.

20:43.626 --> 20:45.226
I saw you with Ben.

20:46.529 --> 20:49.297
I'm so sorry, Hal.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.932
It's --

20:50.966 --> 20:55.303
Ben and I have this connection
because of the spikes.

20:55.338 --> 20:59.107
It's more physical
than anything else. I --

20:59.141 --> 21:01.076
I don't know
how to explain it.

21:01.110 --> 21:04.112
You know, I've already heard
this story, and, um...

21:04.146 --> 21:05.914
You know what?
I get it.

21:05.948 --> 21:08.149
You know, maybe the two of you
are meant for each other.

21:08.217 --> 21:10.418
No.
That's not what I'm saying.

21:10.453 --> 21:12.854
When Ben and I
are near each other,

21:12.888 --> 21:15.957
it's like the <i>spikes</i>
are attracted to each other.

21:15.991 --> 21:18.093
It's totally
out of our control.

21:18.127 --> 21:19.561
You know,
it's just so convenient

21:19.595 --> 21:21.129
that you both
have these spikes

21:21.197 --> 21:23.298
that you can blame
for your lack of self-control.

21:23.332 --> 21:25.500
I got news for you.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.570
Everybody's got
their version of spikes.

21:28.604 --> 21:30.071
"Heart wants
what it wants."

21:30.106 --> 21:32.607
I don't <i>want</i>
to be with Ben.

21:32.641 --> 21:34.008
That's what I'm saying.

21:38.147 --> 21:42.083
You know,
the truth is...

21:42.118 --> 21:45.086
You just really hurt me.

22:07.176 --> 22:09.944
What are you doing?

22:10.012 --> 22:12.247
I should've known you --

22:12.281 --> 22:13.681
you'd try
to get out of it.

22:13.716 --> 22:18.353
Put your name in and sneak back
and take it out, see?

22:18.421 --> 22:21.589
There's a word
for people like you.

22:21.624 --> 22:23.658
Yeah, what's that?
Coward?

22:23.726 --> 22:27.495
Please. I'm the one saying
we should get off our ass,

22:27.563 --> 22:28.924
round up some men
and some weapons,

22:28.931 --> 22:30.465
and frag these cockroaches.

22:30.499 --> 22:33.067
Yeah, why don't you quit
complaining and go do that?

22:33.102 --> 22:35.537
I would.
But I can't -- not alone.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.339
Mason's got everybody
so brainwashed --

22:38.374 --> 22:40.041
Is that what it is?

22:40.075 --> 22:42.076
You never run out of excuses,
do you, Pope?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.711
Why, because
I don't see the point

22:43.746 --> 22:47.549
in wasting nothing but time
on a wing and a prayer?

22:47.583 --> 22:50.051
You know, even if they
get that Beamer running,

22:50.085 --> 22:53.021
it's gonna crash.

22:53.055 --> 22:55.457
Meanwhile, the rest of us --
see, we're all sitting

22:55.524 --> 22:59.394
in one place with a giant target
on our heads!

23:00.996 --> 23:02.163
You watch.

23:03.265 --> 23:05.133
This little "adventure,"

23:05.201 --> 23:07.068
it's gonna end
like they all end --

23:07.102 --> 23:10.205
with a smudge
on a windshield.

23:10.239 --> 23:14.008
We're all just a bunch of
lab rats, cap, just waiting...

23:14.043 --> 23:16.478
For whatever delightful
little skitter experiment

23:16.545 --> 23:20.648
they're brewing up next.

23:20.683 --> 23:22.617
Then again, you'd probably
know all about that,

23:22.651 --> 23:24.986
now, wouldn't you?

23:27.623 --> 23:29.023
Aah!

23:46.442 --> 23:49.110
I didn't take my name
out of the skull!

23:50.212 --> 23:53.047
I didn't take my name
out of the skull.

23:53.115 --> 23:55.550
I just saw you do it!

23:55.584 --> 23:58.253
It wasn't my name.
It was yours...

23:58.287 --> 23:59.587
Yours and Mason's.

23:59.622 --> 24:02.123
What?

24:02.157 --> 24:04.192
What are you
talking about?

24:04.260 --> 24:06.327
Give me that.

24:06.362 --> 24:10.298
I need to be
on that ship.

24:10.332 --> 24:12.333
All right?
I need to be chosen.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.070
Look --

24:16.138 --> 24:19.274
these people, they...

24:19.308 --> 24:21.543
they need you...

24:21.610 --> 24:25.113
You and Mason.
Nobody needs me.

24:25.147 --> 24:26.648
I could disappear tomorrow,

24:26.682 --> 24:28.750
I really doubt that anybody's
gonna notice, all right?

24:28.784 --> 24:30.285
I got to be on that ship.

24:30.319 --> 24:33.354
That Beamer's
on a one-way ticket, all right?

24:33.389 --> 24:36.324
It ain't coming back,
and we both know that.

24:36.358 --> 24:38.660
Let me be...

24:38.694 --> 24:41.229
Let me be the hero, Dan.

24:41.263 --> 24:44.165
Huh?
Let me be the martyr.

24:44.199 --> 24:46.100
Right?

24:46.135 --> 24:49.070
The mission's just -- just
a hail-Mary for the planet, man.

24:49.104 --> 24:50.538
Let me do...

24:50.573 --> 24:53.474
Something --
something --

24:53.509 --> 24:55.610
something
worth remembering.

24:55.644 --> 24:57.545
So you're saying that,
for you,

24:57.613 --> 25:00.682
this is
just another way out.

25:03.352 --> 25:05.386
So what if it is?

25:05.421 --> 25:07.388
Are you serious, Pope?

25:07.423 --> 25:09.791
I'm done. I'm done fighting.
I'm done running.

25:09.858 --> 25:12.627
I'm done
with the whole program.

25:12.661 --> 25:16.331
Mason's right...
about one thing.

25:16.365 --> 25:18.099
This is...

25:18.133 --> 25:20.568
This is no way to live.
This life is not worth living.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.771
And what do I got?

25:23.806 --> 25:25.139
I got no family.

25:25.174 --> 25:26.674
I got --

25:26.709 --> 25:29.243
I got no kids, no wife.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.878
I got nothing, man.

25:32.581 --> 25:34.582
She might come back.

25:43.158 --> 25:44.525
Come on.

25:44.593 --> 25:46.728
I'm sorry.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.730
I-I stand corrected.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.198
I thought...

25:50.265 --> 25:52.400
I know what you thought.

26:07.342 --> 26:09.543
Well, here we are.
Mind if I do the honors?

26:09.577 --> 26:10.811
Go ahead.

26:13.448 --> 26:14.881
Lot of names in here.

26:14.916 --> 26:17.317
Boy, did anybody
<i>not</i> put their name I?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.921
That says a lot.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.923
Thank you.

26:25.994 --> 26:28.695
Okay.

26:28.730 --> 26:30.030
The winner is...

26:41.809 --> 26:43.343
...Ben.

26:43.378 --> 26:44.678
Way to go, kid.

26:44.712 --> 26:46.880
I got your back, kid.
Way to go, Ben.

27:02.430 --> 27:04.598
Well, that's one.

27:04.632 --> 27:05.866
Who's the other?

27:24.118 --> 27:25.452
It's me.

27:29.657 --> 27:31.458
May I?

27:34.896 --> 27:36.797
Looks like it's you and me.
We got this.

27:36.831 --> 27:38.932
Yeah, we got this.

27:43.905 --> 27:48.075
Well, after all of that...
He gets picked anyway.

27:48.109 --> 27:49.943
Now, that is classic.

27:49.977 --> 27:53.413
Two from one family.

27:53.448 --> 27:55.849
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

28:12.066 --> 28:15.168
I got a lot to do
before I go, so...

28:15.203 --> 28:16.937
Tom...

28:16.971 --> 28:18.939
Will you sit down?

28:18.973 --> 28:20.440
Please?

28:25.680 --> 28:27.914
Did you or didn't you?

28:27.949 --> 28:29.950
Did I or didn't I what?

28:29.984 --> 28:31.618
Fix the draw?

28:35.623 --> 28:37.491
This might be the last time
we're together.

28:37.525 --> 28:39.226
Is this really
how you want to leave us?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.863
Did you palm it?

28:42.897 --> 28:43.897
Yeah.

28:43.965 --> 28:45.866
I fixed it.

28:49.504 --> 28:51.471
You know history.

28:51.506 --> 28:53.140
This is exactly
the kind of hubris

28:53.174 --> 28:54.708
that comes
before the fall.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.143
If people found out,

28:56.210 --> 28:59.746
it would destroy their trust
in your leadership.

28:59.781 --> 29:04.117
It would jeopardize everything
we've been fighting for.

29:04.152 --> 29:06.853
Are you really willing
to risk all of that?

29:06.888 --> 29:09.089
I'm not willing
to let Ben go without me.

29:11.993 --> 29:14.494
But even more than that,
I just have this feeling

29:14.529 --> 29:16.596
like I'm supposed to go
on this mission.

29:20.268 --> 29:22.469
I can't even think of
any other way to describe it

29:22.537 --> 29:25.839
except I just have
this sense.

29:25.873 --> 29:27.774
This is
what I'm supposed to do.

29:31.546 --> 29:33.246
It's like
your belief in Lexi.

29:47.962 --> 29:50.764
<i>Are you ready to train?</i>

29:50.798 --> 29:53.200
Yes, father.

29:53.267 --> 29:55.135
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

29:55.169 --> 29:56.603
<i>Relax.</i>

29:56.637 --> 29:58.805
<i>Use the --</i>
The light in my mind.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.775
<i>Yes. That's right.</i>

30:21.128 --> 30:22.696
I've been practicing.

30:22.730 --> 30:25.298
Don't be afraid.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.100
I'm the bringer of peace,
remember?

30:27.134 --> 30:30.036
I heard your conversation
with your brother

30:30.071 --> 30:31.872
in the shadow plane.

30:31.906 --> 30:34.074
I'm not the bringer of peace
at all.

30:34.108 --> 30:35.675
I'm the bringer of death.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.211
<i>Aah!</i>

30:38.246 --> 30:40.046
You were right
about one thing.

30:40.081 --> 30:43.550
Power perfected <i>is</i> divine.

31:00.154 --> 31:01.362
Got to be honest --

31:01.363 --> 31:03.697
I wish I was the one
going up there with you.

31:07.202 --> 31:11.205
They say you can hit a golf ball
about two miles up there.

31:11.239 --> 31:15.042
Bet the putting's tough.

31:16.812 --> 31:19.713
How do you feel
about flying the Beamer?

31:19.748 --> 31:21.749
Mm, I got
the basic controls down,

31:21.783 --> 31:24.518
but until we go live,
until we do it for real...

31:24.553 --> 31:26.086
Well, I don't know.

31:26.121 --> 31:28.055
Nothing to it but to do it.
That's right.

31:30.725 --> 31:32.593
So, I heard about
you and Ben.

31:34.229 --> 31:36.397
Yeah? Who told you?

31:36.431 --> 31:38.399
Ben.

31:38.433 --> 31:40.201
He said
none of this would've happened

31:40.235 --> 31:42.036
if it hadn't been
for the spikes.

31:42.070 --> 31:44.138
You know, that's like saying
the war wouldn't have happened

31:44.206 --> 31:45.706
if it wasn't for
the Espheni.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.075
I don't know if it had anything
to do with the spikes or not.

31:48.109 --> 31:50.444
I do know Ben.
I do know his character.

31:52.180 --> 31:54.648
Maggie told me they both
got feelings for each other.

31:56.551 --> 31:58.118
I'm sorry.

32:01.656 --> 32:03.757
You're not the first brothers
in history

32:03.792 --> 32:05.793
to fall for the same girl.

32:05.827 --> 32:08.529
And ultimately, it won't be
up to you <i>or</i> Ben.

32:08.563 --> 32:11.565
It'll be up to Maggie.

32:11.633 --> 32:13.834
I'm the one who pushed
to give her those spikes

32:13.869 --> 32:16.604
in the first place.

32:16.638 --> 32:18.439
He wants to see you.

32:18.473 --> 32:21.208
You should
go see your brother.

32:22.477 --> 32:25.379
You might not get another chance.
Don't talk like that.

32:25.413 --> 32:28.249
Well, hey, don't make me
feel like I have to.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.803
This one has me scared.

32:52.641 --> 32:56.443
I should've told you everything
from the beginning.

32:56.478 --> 33:01.382
I'm sorry that I didn't.
It won't happen again.

33:01.416 --> 33:05.786
But you're not sorry
you fixed the draw, right?

33:05.820 --> 33:07.488
No.

33:09.424 --> 33:11.825
I won't tell.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.128
I should've known...

33:14.162 --> 33:17.131
When they announced the draw,
you'd find a way to go.

33:20.702 --> 33:22.569
You're a good father.

33:29.911 --> 33:34.715
I'm gonna do everything
that I can to come back to you.

33:34.783 --> 33:36.650
I promise.

33:40.855 --> 33:44.591
I have a gift for you.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.327
A going-away present?

33:46.361 --> 33:50.197
Nope. A second-day anniversary
present.

33:50.231 --> 33:51.465
What is it?

33:58.673 --> 34:01.475
Epictetus. The stoic.

34:03.411 --> 34:07.581
"A man should be prepared
to be sufficient unto himself."

34:07.615 --> 34:09.616
It's one of my favorites.
I know.

34:09.684 --> 34:10.815
Where'd you find it?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.920
I found it in some rubble
when we were digging for you.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.922
Caught my eye.
I've been saving it.

34:14.989 --> 34:16.924
Thank you.

34:16.958 --> 34:19.626
It's pocket-sized. It's perfect
for the man on the go.

34:22.429 --> 34:26.367
You sure a man should be
sufficient unto himself?

34:31.373 --> 34:33.474
What does Epictetus know?

34:52.860 --> 34:56.362
How's it going?

34:56.398 --> 34:57.831
Um, bomb's packed,

34:57.866 --> 35:00.501
set the Tovex for the charge,
double-checked the wiring.

35:00.535 --> 35:02.603
Just got
to connect the timer.

35:02.637 --> 35:05.506
I meant with you.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.641
I mean, you must be scared,
right?

35:10.278 --> 35:13.580
I probably shouldn't be here.
Probably.

35:16.284 --> 35:18.519
I just had to say goodbye.

35:24.692 --> 35:25.859
I'm gonna miss you.

35:25.927 --> 35:28.395
I'm, um --
I won't be gone too long.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.564
I'll be back
before you know it.

35:30.598 --> 35:32.599
I'm serious.

35:50.685 --> 35:52.653
I'm gonna miss you, too.

36:11.339 --> 36:14.575
We shouldn't.

36:14.609 --> 36:15.876
Hal.

36:15.910 --> 36:18.045
Hal...

36:26.688 --> 36:28.555
I came to accept your apology.

36:31.092 --> 36:33.594
Hal...
Just --

36:33.628 --> 36:36.330
just stop.

36:37.765 --> 36:39.333
Sorry.

36:44.472 --> 36:45.906
Hal!

36:49.911 --> 36:51.411
Hal!

37:01.656 --> 37:04.658
Worst goodbye ever.

37:09.103 --> 37:11.737
Okay, Dingaan.
Looks like we're all set.

37:11.772 --> 37:14.307
Any last thoughts
on our flight plan?

37:14.341 --> 37:16.109
Remember, once you reach
the upper atmosphere...

37:16.143 --> 37:18.144
...you'll know it because you'll
be able to see the corona.

37:18.178 --> 37:19.445
Above the surface
to the north.

37:19.513 --> 37:20.713
That's when I turn
the beacon on.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.148
You have it.
Of course you do.

37:22.182 --> 37:23.416
Thanks for everything,
my friend.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.218
Good luck, Tom.
Thank you.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.721
Hey.

37:28.755 --> 37:31.424
Keep my family safe, huh?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.693
You got it.
Godspeed.

37:37.364 --> 37:39.699
Keep an eye on Colonel Weaver
for me, would you?

37:39.733 --> 37:41.734
Where are you, Hal?

37:43.504 --> 37:46.272
Matt, I'm counting on you
to be strong.

37:46.306 --> 37:49.242
Don't be afraid
to let yourself feel things.

37:49.276 --> 37:52.478
I feel things.
Just got to be tough about them.

37:52.513 --> 37:54.686
Well, you don't have to
be so tough all the time.

37:54.710 --> 37:56.275
Yes, you do.

38:01.088 --> 38:02.722
Dad, I love you.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.060
I love you.

38:21.608 --> 38:24.243
Thank you...

38:24.278 --> 38:28.114
For protecting me
and for...

38:28.148 --> 38:29.815
Loving me and...

38:29.883 --> 38:34.353
Understanding me.

38:34.388 --> 38:35.721
I shall return.

38:35.756 --> 38:38.357
Oh, you better.
You owe me a honeymoon.

38:56.476 --> 38:58.778
You know, I was thinking about
everything that happened last night,

38:58.812 --> 39:03.749
and, um...I just want to let
you know I forgive you.

39:09.756 --> 39:12.892
I do have feelings for Maggie.
I'm sorry, but I do.

39:15.329 --> 39:17.663
Well,
thanks for coming clean.

39:17.698 --> 39:20.233
Don't worry. For her, it's about the spikes.
You know, let's --

39:20.267 --> 39:21.834
let's just not even
talk about it, you know?

39:21.868 --> 39:24.937
I-I don't think this is the time
or the place, and, uh...

39:27.741 --> 39:30.443
Thanks for forgiving me...

39:30.477 --> 39:32.211
And for not punching me.

39:32.246 --> 39:34.647
Okay.

39:34.681 --> 39:36.482
You know,
the truth of the matter is,

39:36.516 --> 39:38.684
I'm not the one
that gets to tell Maggie

39:38.719 --> 39:40.886
what she can and can't do,
anyway, so...

39:40.921 --> 39:42.755
It's up to her.

39:42.823 --> 39:46.492
You're right.
It's up to her.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.161
Who knows, man?
Next couple of years,

39:49.229 --> 39:51.070
Matt will probably end up
marrying her, anyway.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.267
Come here.

40:00.841 --> 40:02.775
Hey, keep an eye on dad
up there, all right?

40:02.809 --> 40:05.711
Yeah.
Oh, good.

40:05.746 --> 40:08.247
I'm glad to see
you two made up.

40:21.762 --> 40:23.262
Go get 'em.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.298
Wait! Wait!
Stop the launch! Stop!

40:25.332 --> 40:27.233
What's the matter?
I hear something!

40:27.267 --> 40:29.869
The hell is it?
Something's coming.

40:31.438 --> 40:34.006
Come on! Move! Move!
