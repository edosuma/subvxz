00:20.849 --> 00:23.488
This place couldn't be more dead
if I was embalmed.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.799
Yeah, I think that we're gonna
have to take that offer.

00:27.409 --> 00:29.445
- What's this guy's name again?
- Chris Barker.

00:29.609 --> 00:31.361
And he's not a loan shark
or anything, is he?

00:31.529 --> 00:33.247
No. He's a collector, an investor.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.718
And it's a no-interest loan that
we can pay back any time.

00:35.889 --> 00:37.959
And trust me,
he's not gonna miss the money.

00:38.169 --> 00:42.765
- Must be nice. When do we tell Piper?
- Not until the club is in the black.

00:45.049 --> 00:47.927
So you guys do like the name
of the club right? P3?

00:48.169 --> 00:50.478
Little nod to the power of three,
to us, partners?

00:50.649 --> 00:54.437
Yeah, it's very clever.
Piper, it's a little...

00:56.169 --> 00:58.399
...quiet in here, don't you think?

00:58.569 --> 01:00.878
Lt'll pick up
once word of mouth kicks in.

01:01.049 --> 01:03.279
And when will that be, exactly?

01:03.449 --> 01:05.325
Well, you can't predict
these things exactly.

01:05.489 --> 01:06.922
It's not like starting a restaurant.

01:07.089 --> 01:08.920
Besides, the bank's
not gonna call the loan.

01:09.089 --> 01:10.727
It's not like we're gonna
lose the house.

01:10.969 --> 01:12.800
Who said anything
about losing the house?

01:12.969 --> 01:14.448
We're not gonna lose
the house, are we?

01:14.609 --> 01:16.964
No, because we're gonna take
that offer and trust Piper

01:17.169 --> 01:19.637
- to pack this place with people.
- What people?

01:22.489 --> 01:24.559
Where is everybody?

02:14.849 --> 02:17.488
So you, like,
produce the records, or what?

02:17.689 --> 02:21.204
No, no, nothing that creative.
I'm their new manager.

02:21.649 --> 02:24.925
I take care of things.
Whatever needs to be done, I do.

02:25.769 --> 02:27.600
Man, I can't believe this.
This is, like,

02:27.769 --> 02:30.124
the most unbelievable thing
that has ever happened to me.

02:30.289 --> 02:31.642
Well, the night's young.

02:31.849 --> 02:36.047
- I can't believe you picked me.
- Well, you seemed like a good soul.

02:36.569 --> 02:40.005
Plus, you said the magic words. You
said you'd do anything, remember?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.202
Yes, yes, I do.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.122
All right. So wait inside,
the band should be down any minute.

02:45.289 --> 02:46.961
Thank you, thank you so much.

02:47.489 --> 02:48.558
Don't thank me yet.

03:03.969 --> 03:07.723
Hello?
Is somebody there? Hello?

03:10.209 --> 03:11.642
Hurry up, damn it!

03:38.169 --> 03:40.808
Okay, that's it. No more.

03:42.849 --> 03:46.080
I can't keep doing this.
It's gotta stop.

03:46.409 --> 03:48.206
We have a pact.

03:48.369 --> 03:54.160
You get what you want,
and I get what I want.

03:54.569 --> 03:56.924
I want.

05:21.809 --> 05:24.039
Good morning, San Francisco.
This is Ralph Garman,

05:24.329 --> 05:26.604
and that was Dishwalla's hit,
"Counting Blue Cars."

05:26.769 --> 05:28.361
Dishwalla and their manager,
Jeff Carlton,

05:28.529 --> 05:30.042
are my in-studio guests this morning,

05:30.249 --> 05:32.922
talking about club dates here and
around the country. So stay tuned,

05:33.089 --> 05:34.841
and we'll let you know
where you can see them.

05:36.529 --> 05:38.440
- Excuse me.
- They want him to go in 30 seconds.

05:38.609 --> 05:40.201
Jerk. You know where
the bathroom is?

05:40.369 --> 05:42.599
Yeah, it's right over...

05:43.209 --> 05:45.564
- Hey, what is this?
- An intervention.

06:07.009 --> 06:08.727
This is bad.

06:13.769 --> 06:15.839
You should keep
that door locked, you know?

06:16.529 --> 06:18.520
Anyone could just walk in.

06:19.289 --> 06:20.847
Jenny, what are you doing here?

06:21.049 --> 06:24.121
Am I breaking the law right now?
Being underage and all?

06:24.289 --> 06:27.247
No, we're not open.
Actually, I don't know.

06:27.489 --> 06:29.081
What's your point, Jenny?

06:29.249 --> 06:30.807
Well, if you were open for business,

06:30.969 --> 06:33.119
and I was in here,
would you have me arrested?

06:33.289 --> 06:35.519
Because I think friendship counts
for something,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.560
and even though
we're not really friends yet...

06:37.769 --> 06:39.168
But at least we're neighbours,

06:39.329 --> 06:41.445
and neighbours do favours
for each other, right?

06:41.609 --> 06:44.646
- What kind of favours?
- I need a ticket to the show.

06:44.809 --> 06:47.607
- What show?
- It's all over the radio.

06:47.769 --> 06:51.205
I have to see them. If I don't, I'll die.

06:51.409 --> 06:54.799
- Not a clue what you're talking about.
- She's talking about passion.

06:56.289 --> 06:57.438
Piper Halliwell?

06:57.609 --> 07:00.965
- Yeah, can I help you with something?
- Jeff Carlton.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.049
I have to tell you,
when I heard about "P-Cubed,"

07:04.209 --> 07:06.200
it was as if the fates
had smiled upon me.

07:06.409 --> 07:09.242
- P3.
- Whatever.

07:09.609 --> 07:11.406
I manage Dishwalla.

07:12.289 --> 07:14.644
Dishwalla? The Dishwalla?

07:14.849 --> 07:16.680
I've been looking for the right
kind of place,

07:16.849 --> 07:19.921
something small, new, intimate.

07:20.209 --> 07:21.642
The boys wanna reacquaint
themselves

07:21.809 --> 07:23.242
with the personal side of performing.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.842
They wanna connect again.

07:25.329 --> 07:28.321
I think your little hole in the wall
here is just what the doctor ordered.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.209
Dishwalla wants to play
my "little hole in the wall"?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.637
I want them to. Don't you?

07:34.089 --> 07:36.603
- Yeah.
- Then let's cross some T's

07:36.769 --> 07:38.407
and dot some I's.

07:39.329 --> 07:41.638
Mr Carlton, sir,

07:41.809 --> 07:45.040
do you think it'll be possible
for me to meet the band?

07:45.369 --> 07:46.688
I'd do almost anything.

07:49.729 --> 07:51.685
Careful what you wish for,
sweetheart.

07:57.169 --> 08:00.286
- Prue, don't feel awkward.
- Well, it's a big deal.

08:00.449 --> 08:02.519
I know, starting a business
with that bank loan

08:02.689 --> 08:04.884
breathing down your neck
can make things kind of scary.

08:05.049 --> 08:08.280
- Yeah, on top of your loan.
- Hey, listen, I have no doubt

08:08.449 --> 08:09.564
I'll be seeing my money again

08:09.729 --> 08:11.606
after your sister gets her club
off the ground.

08:11.769 --> 08:15.239
- And the terms are still the same?
- Absolutely. No interest.

08:15.409 --> 08:19.038
- No, we'll pay you interest.
- Okay, fine.

08:19.209 --> 08:20.608
A quarter percent, whatever.

08:21.089 --> 08:23.239
Now, speaking of getting off
the ground,

08:23.409 --> 08:28.085
that plane trip to Paris
is still open for discussion, isn't it?

08:28.649 --> 08:29.923
Mr Barker...

08:30.089 --> 08:31.966
I mean, come on,
hasn't that rain check

08:32.129 --> 08:33.847
burned a hole in your pocket
by now?

08:34.009 --> 08:36.000
Look, I really appreciate your offer...

08:36.169 --> 08:40.207
It's not an offer, Prue.
It's a dinner request.

08:40.369 --> 08:41.847
In Paris.

08:42.849 --> 08:45.238
You know what
they call French bread in France?

08:45.409 --> 08:47.604
- Bread.
- Exactly.

08:48.009 --> 08:51.240
Dinner in Paris is where it all begins.

08:52.569 --> 08:55.800
You know, why don't we just start
with your loan,

08:55.969 --> 08:58.278
followed with us paying
you back as soon as possible.

08:58.449 --> 09:02.044
- You're a hard bargainer.
- So are you.

09:02.249 --> 09:04.809
Oh, I haven't even begun to fight.

09:06.689 --> 09:08.088
Paris?

09:08.369 --> 09:10.200
- Stop it.
- Never.

09:11.129 --> 09:13.768
I'll see you at the club
with the money.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.362
Okay, bye-bye.

09:17.889 --> 09:19.720
Well, it's all set.

09:19.889 --> 09:21.527
Mr Barker's gonna meet us
at the club,

09:21.689 --> 09:23.361
hand over the check,
and that'll be that.

09:24.249 --> 09:26.126
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we?

09:26.609 --> 09:31.205
Well, we're helping out our sister.
That's always the right thing, right?

09:31.889 --> 09:33.641
Guess what I did!
Guess what I did!

09:33.809 --> 09:35.083
- All by myself!
- What?

09:35.249 --> 09:36.284
- You ready?
- What?

09:36.449 --> 09:40.203
Get this: Dishwalla, my club,
playing there tonight.

09:40.689 --> 09:42.042
- What?
- I networked,

09:42.249 --> 09:44.126
sent out feelers,
sent off press releases,

09:44.289 --> 09:47.486
and wouldn't you know it, Dishwalla
decided to put P3 on their schedule.

09:47.649 --> 09:51.119
How's about that? P3 has officially
been validated as the place to be.

09:51.289 --> 09:52.483
We are on the map.

09:52.689 --> 09:55.840
And I couldn't have done it
without you, you patient,

09:56.329 --> 09:59.719
most generous sisters
in the whole wide world.

10:00.129 --> 10:01.403
I'll get it.

10:06.889 --> 10:10.086
Leo. This day just keeps
getting better. Hi.

10:10.289 --> 10:12.644
- Hi. Piper, we have to talk.
- Yeah, okay.

10:12.889 --> 10:15.449
Are you free tonight?
Better be, because you're my date.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.526
We have backstage passes,
all-access, baby,

10:17.689 --> 10:19.202
to see Dishwalla at P3.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.123
- I made it happen.
- No, actually, I made it happen.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.200
- What?
- Look, I wanted to tell you sooner,

10:25.369 --> 10:26.848
but I didn't have the time.

10:27.009 --> 10:29.239
I had to move fast.
There's a demon involved.

10:29.769 --> 10:33.318
- A demon?
- Yeah, he'll be in your club tonight.

10:33.489 --> 10:37.198
But, no, their manager, Jeff Carlton,
came to me and booked them himself.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.599
- I know, I cast a spell on him.
- You what?

10:39.769 --> 10:42.237
I sort of cribbed it from one
of the other witches I look after.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.321
I suggested to Carlton
that he get Dishwalla into your club.

10:45.489 --> 10:46.842
Why didn't you just come to us?

10:47.009 --> 10:48.806
Because he knows
I would have been pissed off.

10:48.969 --> 10:50.641
- What are you doing?
- My job.

10:50.809 --> 10:52.606
Your job? What are we,
like, Leo's witches now?

10:52.769 --> 10:54.999
We're supposed to kill a demon
during a sold-out concert?

10:55.169 --> 10:56.284
- Are you nuts?
- Piper.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.486
No. Leo, anywhere else,
but not there, not my place.

11:02.249 --> 11:05.400
Look, the band's manager
made a bargain with Masselin.

11:05.569 --> 11:07.127
- That's the demon?
- Yeah. In exchange

11:07.289 --> 11:10.599
for human sacrifice,
Masselin will make Carlton rich

11:10.769 --> 11:12.999
and powerful by attracting
successful bands to him.

11:13.169 --> 11:15.478
Are you telling me Dishwalla
is hooked up with a demon?

11:15.649 --> 11:17.401
They don't know anything
about the demon.

11:17.569 --> 11:20.208
So these innocents,
what happens to them?

11:20.369 --> 11:23.088
They're devoured by Masselin,
consumed for their souls.

11:24.369 --> 11:27.327
The more souls Masselin collects,
the more successful Carlton becomes.

11:27.489 --> 11:28.763
Now, you can't destroy the demon

11:28.929 --> 11:30.885
without first freeing
those trapped within him.

11:31.049 --> 11:35.679
All this freeing and destroying, is this
in between sets or during the encore?

11:38.049 --> 11:41.644
Look, I know you're upset.

11:41.809 --> 11:45.961
No, no, I skated past upset
just after you came in the door.

11:46.129 --> 11:48.768
- Right now I'm at furious.
- We have to talk.

11:48.929 --> 11:52.239
- You bet your whitelighter ass we do.
- All right, but later. I have to go.

11:58.329 --> 12:01.162
See, now, this is exactly why
you should never date a coworker.

12:02.009 --> 12:03.601
It was a joke.

12:04.329 --> 12:07.287
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
- How could he do this?

12:07.449 --> 12:09.599
Well, it sounds like
he didn't have a choice.

12:09.769 --> 12:12.442
And quite frankly,
I don't think we do either.

12:13.409 --> 12:17.925
Well, I have to get to the office
and call this investor.

12:18.089 --> 12:19.727
Barker. I gotta talk to Barker.

12:27.489 --> 12:30.481
- Stick it up there with the bass.
- Okay.

12:30.689 --> 12:31.963
This is Tina Hitchens.

12:32.129 --> 12:34.689
She's been missing since last night,
when she came to this club.

12:34.889 --> 12:38.040
Yo, the address is
on the front seat, P3.

12:38.249 --> 12:39.807
- You got it.
- You're playing P3?

12:39.969 --> 12:41.084
Piper Halliwell's place?

12:41.689 --> 12:44.522
- Yeah, so I don't have a lot of time.
- Well, you've got time for this.

12:46.529 --> 12:48.599
- I answered your question.
- I didn't ask one.

12:49.649 --> 12:53.039
- You asked me if I saw Tina whoever.
- I don't believe I did. Did you?

12:53.209 --> 12:54.801
- What?
- See her.

12:55.569 --> 12:58.037
I didn't see anybody, inspector.

12:58.689 --> 13:00.042
Look again.

13:00.209 --> 13:02.359
Listen, you have any idea
how many girls like that

13:02.529 --> 13:03.723
show up to something like this?

13:03.889 --> 13:06.767
Hundreds of them, thousands,
and they all look the same.

13:06.969 --> 13:11.042
Short skirts, tight tops,
like sexy little peas in a pod.

13:11.209 --> 13:13.165
So, what difference does
it make if one disappears?

13:13.329 --> 13:15.047
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

13:15.209 --> 13:16.927
Why aren't you out hassling
her boyfriend?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.881
Did that already.
Now I'm hassling you.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.847
I haven't seen her.
What's with the Gestapo routine!

13:22.009 --> 13:24.318
It tends to follow
the acting-like-a-suspect routine.

13:24.649 --> 13:26.162
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

13:29.249 --> 13:31.558
- Melody Jenkins?
- No.

13:32.249 --> 13:35.002
- Brittany Tyler?
- None of them. Never saw them.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.123
They all disappeared from clubs
all around the country,

13:38.329 --> 13:41.207
clubs that your band played in.
That doesn't concern you?

13:41.489 --> 13:44.845
Not in the slightest.
If we're done here, see you around.

13:46.809 --> 13:48.162
Count on it.

13:53.209 --> 13:55.928
- There's Leo's problem.
- It's our problem.

13:56.089 --> 13:57.681
You wanna know what
the real problem is?

13:57.849 --> 13:58.838
Oh, do tell.

13:59.009 --> 14:00.328
- Never mind.
- Thank you.

14:00.489 --> 14:03.401
- So how do we vanquish this creep?
- Oh, let's find out, shall we?

14:03.569 --> 14:05.446
And what was with that attitude?

14:05.769 --> 14:07.248
What attitude?

14:07.449 --> 14:09.246
Leo, it was like he was angry
that I was angry.

14:09.409 --> 14:11.684
I have a right to be angry.
I don't wanna talk about it.

14:11.889 --> 14:13.083
Then don't.

14:14.169 --> 14:16.125
- What?
- Look, Masselin's victims.

14:16.729 --> 14:20.847
Yeah. "Trapped within the demon,
the unfortunates are kept alive,

14:21.089 --> 14:24.161
their souls tortured for the pleasure
he gets from their suffering."

14:25.849 --> 14:29.046
- We gotta get them out of there.
- With what? Demonic ipecac?

14:29.209 --> 14:32.042
Actually, yeah,
that seems to be the idea.

14:32.209 --> 14:34.086
"The demon seeks willing,
trusting souls

14:34.289 --> 14:36.962
delivered by the one
who sealed the pact."

14:37.729 --> 14:39.799
- The manager.
- So we have to get close to Carlton.

14:39.969 --> 14:42.005
Well, I'm already close,
and as far as we know,

14:42.169 --> 14:44.683
I'm a willing, trusting soul,
a sucker.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.965
Someone who falls
for a quick line from a pretty face.

14:47.129 --> 14:50.041
- Will you please stop that?
- You're right. Fine.

14:50.209 --> 14:51.722
Leo is the least of my worries.

14:51.889 --> 14:53.959
Right. We'll worry
about that tomorrow.

14:54.129 --> 14:56.518
- I don't think I can wait that long.
- You're gonna have to,

14:56.689 --> 14:59.965
because tonight we have
some major demon ass-kicking to do.

15:11.889 --> 15:14.483
The cops are asking questions.
And you know what?

15:14.649 --> 15:17.038
They're not gonna catch you. No, sir.
They're gonna catch me.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.006
All right, okay, I'm out.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.922
I'm done with it. No more souls.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.445
The pact, the agreement
is now officially null and void.

15:32.929 --> 15:36.001
You will honour your agreement,
Mr Carlton.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.208
- You will bring me more souls.
- Okay.

15:39.649 --> 15:42.243
More souls.

15:49.209 --> 15:52.758
So, what you're telling me
is that you no longer need

15:53.489 --> 15:56.367
a white knight to rescue you
and your sisters from debt.

15:56.969 --> 15:58.800
- No.
- But we have a deal.

15:58.969 --> 16:02.564
Well, what we had was
an agreement to make a deal,

16:03.089 --> 16:06.286
- and I no longer agree.
- I see.

16:07.729 --> 16:09.924
This wouldn't have anything to do
with a certain

16:10.089 --> 16:13.240
band choosing to play P3 tonight,
would it?

16:13.449 --> 16:14.723
- Word travels fast.
- Yeah, well,

16:14.889 --> 16:16.322
Piper pulled us out of the fire.

16:16.489 --> 16:20.004
Yes, and in doing so, revealed to me
quite a diamond in the rough.

16:20.609 --> 16:22.167
- Meaning what?
- Well, meaning

16:22.449 --> 16:25.680
I understand you're showing me the
door, but I think I rather like this party.

16:25.849 --> 16:28.841
I think your sister's little venture
is on its way to great success,

16:29.129 --> 16:30.403
which is why

16:30.569 --> 16:33.288
I've already gone to your bank and
made an offer to pick up your loan.

16:33.449 --> 16:36.486
- You didn't.
- Did.

16:37.489 --> 16:40.561
Okay, Mr Barker,

16:41.409 --> 16:43.400
- we have a relationship.
- Yes, and you've brought

16:43.569 --> 16:46.129
so many valuable items
into my field of view,

16:46.289 --> 16:49.725
I just have this feeling that your sister's
club is gonna be the best one yet.

16:49.889 --> 16:52.119
Could you put me
on the guest list for tonight?

16:52.289 --> 16:55.326
Me plus one.
I'd like to see what I'm buying.

16:56.129 --> 16:58.723
Okay, I am asking nicely,

16:58.969 --> 17:01.119
for your own sake,
not to go through with this.

17:01.329 --> 17:03.365
Is that a threat, Miss Halliwell?

17:04.929 --> 17:08.604
Be careful, you could be jeopardizing
a very profitable relationship.

17:09.969 --> 17:11.448
Two passes.

17:11.608 --> 17:13.964
I'd like a booth too,
close to the stage.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.762
How is this gonna work?

17:23.929 --> 17:26.682
We are just gonna slip Masselin
a little extra-strength antacid.

17:26.888 --> 17:29.642
And if the Book of Shadows is right,
he should disappear

17:29.809 --> 17:32.084
like some demonic gas bubble,
freeing his victims,

17:32.249 --> 17:33.318
leaving them safe and sound.

17:33.489 --> 17:35.684
Phoebe, we can't even give
our cat a vitamin.

17:35.849 --> 17:37.840
How are we gonna
get this down a demon's throat?

17:38.849 --> 17:40.760
- In this.
- What is that?

17:40.969 --> 17:43.324
- It's a balloon.
- Okay, where is it?

17:43.809 --> 17:44.878
Where is what?

17:45.049 --> 17:47.483
The spoonful of sugar
big enough to hide that thing.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.368
- You're looking at her.
- Excuse me?

17:50.529 --> 17:53.043
Well, the only way to get
to Masselin is through Carlton, right?

17:53.569 --> 17:55.719
So all I have to do
is get close to Carlton,

17:55.969 --> 18:01.248
pretend I'm some choice titbit,
then we get Masselin to swallow this...

18:01.449 --> 18:05.044
Right before he swallows you,
Phoebe. No, it's too dangerous.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.519
Well, unless you have a better idea,
it's our only choice.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.805
You and Prue will back me up.
I'll be fine.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.082
I hate him.

18:18.449 --> 18:20.644
Of course you hate him.
He's a demon.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.606
Wait, we are talking
about the demon, right?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.522
He didn't even have
the decency to ask me first.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.526
He at least could've
discussed it with me.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.408
- Leo.
- I mean, can you believe him?

18:30.569 --> 18:33.037
He acted as if we've never even
had a relationship before,

18:33.209 --> 18:34.688
like it was just business.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.678
Got to put the lid on, honey.

18:43.249 --> 18:46.321
And I saw the future too.
You know, Leo and I get married.

18:46.609 --> 18:49.919
A marriage in the future implies some
sort of relationship in the present.

18:50.089 --> 18:52.080
The question is,
where's the relationship?

18:52.369 --> 18:55.600
Somewhere between confusing
and complicated.

18:55.849 --> 18:57.680
Just talk to him, honey. It'll be okay.

18:57.889 --> 19:00.687
I'd rather just freeze him
and kick him in the...

19:02.049 --> 19:03.448
That better not be him.

19:06.249 --> 19:08.809
- In the shins?
- Not exactly.

19:13.169 --> 19:15.125
- Piper.
- Dan. Hi.

19:15.289 --> 19:18.042
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, what's up?

19:18.849 --> 19:22.444
Jenny, did you tell her she
could go see Dishwalla tonight?

19:22.649 --> 19:25.607
- No, no, she can't go.
- She said you said it was all right.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.319
Well, I didn't exactly
tell her it wasn't,

19:28.489 --> 19:30.241
but things were happening
kind of fast.

19:30.409 --> 19:32.684
Well, she's in her room right now
picking out clothes.

19:32.849 --> 19:35.158
Oh, God. Okay, I'll go talk to her.

19:36.569 --> 19:38.685
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:38.849 --> 19:42.364
Listen, I was hoping
that we could talk.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.919
- Sure. Leo, this is...
- Dan Gordon.

19:46.649 --> 19:48.048
Wait, you know him?

19:48.209 --> 19:50.769
Are you kidding? He used to play
second base for the Mariners.

19:50.929 --> 19:53.489
He had an all-star season
till he blew his knee sliding into home.

19:53.649 --> 19:55.685
- I still think you were safe.
- So do I.

19:55.849 --> 19:57.248
- I'm Leo.
- Nice meeting you.

19:57.409 --> 20:00.321
No, it's not. You follow baseball?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.365
- Yeah.
- You have time for baseball, but you

20:03.529 --> 20:06.089
don't have time to tell me about
you-know-what before you-know-who

20:06.249 --> 20:08.604
shows up you-know-where?

20:08.809 --> 20:11.767
Listen, if you two need
to talk or something, I can...

20:11.929 --> 20:15.365
No, no, no, we don't need to talk.
Leo stops by occasionally to fix things.

20:15.529 --> 20:18.965
Phoebe can show him around.
Let's go talk to Jenny.

20:19.329 --> 20:21.718
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

20:25.009 --> 20:28.604
- She's just a little upset.
- Yeah, I don't blame her.

20:36.529 --> 20:39.965
Right. And this is where you say,
"Darryl?" and I say, "Prue?"

20:40.129 --> 20:42.404
And then you say something like,
"What are you doing here?"

20:42.569 --> 20:44.321
What are you talking about?

20:44.489 --> 20:47.049
Andy didn't have time to teach me
all the steps in this dance,

20:47.209 --> 20:48.688
but I'm a quick study.

20:49.049 --> 20:51.040
- I have to go.
- To P3?

20:51.729 --> 20:56.405
As usual, I barely know
what's going on. And I don't like it.

20:56.769 --> 20:58.725
Look, I will explain everything
to you later.

20:58.929 --> 21:01.762
But you never do.
I know it's all about keeping me safe,

21:01.929 --> 21:04.159
and I respect that.

21:04.369 --> 21:06.280
What do you know
about Jeff Carlton?

21:06.449 --> 21:09.043
- I can't.
- This is about my job.

21:09.849 --> 21:12.727
Andy is gone, but I'm not Andy.

21:12.889 --> 21:15.278
And I'm not saying that you have
to tell me about everything.

21:15.449 --> 21:17.405
But whenever you and your sisters
get involved,

21:17.569 --> 21:19.241
the whole playing field
gets a little crazy.

21:19.409 --> 21:21.798
- Yeah, and a lot more dangerous.
- I'm a cop!

21:21.969 --> 21:26.042
- Stop protecting me, Prue.
- Look, you have absolutely no idea...

21:26.209 --> 21:28.882
I'm an imaginative guy.
I have plenty of ideas.

21:29.089 --> 21:31.887
I even had you three working
for the CIA for a while.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.277
But none of that matters.

21:33.449 --> 21:36.759
What matters is that you and I
work out some kind of relationship.

21:36.929 --> 21:41.002
We're gonna need to communicate,
or I'm gonna become very unsociable.

21:44.249 --> 21:45.398
Okay.

21:47.449 --> 21:52.443
- The missing girls and Jeff Carlton.
- We're working on it.

21:54.489 --> 21:57.242
- I figured.
- Look...

21:58.529 --> 22:01.089
...Darryl, just trust us, okay?

22:02.209 --> 22:03.961
We've got this one for right now.

22:05.289 --> 22:08.247
- Sure.
- I have to go.

22:14.809 --> 22:16.367
Be careful.

22:20.849 --> 22:22.328
Jenny, the state
could shut me down.

22:22.489 --> 22:24.684
How are they gonna find out?
Are you gonna tell them?

22:24.849 --> 22:27.283
Because I'm not gonna tell them.
You like the red or the denim?

22:27.449 --> 22:30.043
- Jenny.
- Yeah, let's hear from Uncle Dan,

22:30.249 --> 22:32.888
who never in his life
faked an ID or snuck into a bar,

22:33.089 --> 22:34.488
who never did anything wrong, ever.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.688
- We're talking about you.
- No, we're talking about Piper.

22:37.849 --> 22:40.443
- She said I could go see the show.
- I never said that.

22:41.409 --> 22:44.128
Jenny, I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in the club.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.326
Your mom and dad,
they put me in charge.

22:46.529 --> 22:50.442
Right, everybody's in charge,
but not me, not ever. Why is that?

22:58.009 --> 23:00.842
I'm sorry, she's just feeling,
you know, a little...

23:01.049 --> 23:05.088
Betrayed. It's okay.
I know the feeling.

23:10.609 --> 23:13.248
You didn't leave any passes
for that investment guy, did you?

23:13.449 --> 23:14.768
No way.

23:14.929 --> 23:17.727
The bouncer has his orders.
Chris Barker is not allowed.

23:17.889 --> 23:20.847
The last thing we need is for Piper
to find out she's gonna lose her club.

23:21.009 --> 23:22.647
If the bank accepts his offer...

23:22.809 --> 23:24.527
One hellish complication at a time.

23:24.689 --> 23:27.157
- Okay, do you have the poison pill?
- Armed and dangerous.

23:27.329 --> 23:29.604
Good, because
here comes demon boy.

23:29.769 --> 23:31.680
Positions.

23:35.169 --> 23:38.718
- Mr Carlton.
- Nice crowd. Is the band here?

23:38.889 --> 23:40.288
Yep, they came in the back way.

23:40.449 --> 23:42.201
They're right over there.
Everything's ready.

23:42.369 --> 23:44.564
Better be. I don't want any problems.

23:46.409 --> 23:49.207
- That's too bad.
- Talking to yourself again, I see.

23:49.409 --> 23:50.683
What are you doing here?

23:50.849 --> 23:52.646
Watching over things.
It's what I do, remember?

23:52.809 --> 23:54.845
I remember when it didn't used
to be a job.

23:55.009 --> 23:57.284
Look, this isn't easy
for me either, Piper, you know?

23:57.449 --> 23:59.679
Leo, I really can't talk
about this right now. Excuse me.

24:04.689 --> 24:07.442
- Okay, Pheebs, go get him.
- Keep an eye on me.

24:07.609 --> 24:09.361
You're kind of hard
to miss in that outfit.

24:12.249 --> 24:15.480
When you're done with the lights,
let's do the sound check, okay?

24:15.649 --> 24:17.048
Excuse me.

24:17.409 --> 24:21.084
- Aren't you Jeff Carlton?
- Yes.

24:21.249 --> 24:25.765
Yeah, I recognized you from that MTV
top-ten-videos thing last month.

24:25.929 --> 24:27.521
Somebody actually saw that?

24:27.849 --> 24:30.409
- Well, I'm flattered.
- Hey, it was riveting.

24:30.609 --> 24:32.440
I taped that almost two months ago.

24:32.649 --> 24:34.526
I didn't even know
there was such a thing

24:34.689 --> 24:38.841
as a music manager, let alone what
they did, until you came on the scene.

24:39.009 --> 24:40.362
I mean, who knew?

24:40.929 --> 24:45.400
I'm now taking a class in music
management at the Learning Annex.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.203
- You're my inspiration.
- Really?

24:48.449 --> 24:52.488
Cross my heart.
Hey, do you have any pointers?

24:52.729 --> 24:57.519
I would do just about anything
to get the inside scoop.

24:58.929 --> 25:00.408
Anything, huh?

25:02.569 --> 25:05.083
- Wanna meet the band?
- Yeah!

25:05.649 --> 25:06.923
This way.

25:08.889 --> 25:10.607
Where is he taking her?

25:12.729 --> 25:14.082
In the back.

25:16.569 --> 25:18.082
All right, let's go.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.723
- Hey, what's the rush?
- No time to waste.

26:01.329 --> 26:02.842
- Are you all right?
- Did you get him?

26:03.009 --> 26:05.045
- No. I think we need a bigger balloon.
- What?

26:05.209 --> 26:08.042
Okay, we're gonna have
to regroup. Let's go.

26:23.889 --> 26:27.484
He's huge and ugly, and I really think
we need a bigger balloon.

26:27.649 --> 26:30.038
- Maybe we just came in too soon.
- Maybe he saw the potion.

26:30.209 --> 26:31.688
Well, in any case,
the spook spooked.

26:31.849 --> 26:34.921
And took the trapped souls with him,
the ones that we have to save.

26:35.089 --> 26:36.841
We don't know for sure
if the demon is gone.

26:37.009 --> 26:39.000
But if he is still here,
then he's gonna feed again,

26:39.169 --> 26:41.524
and Carlton feeds him.
Do you still have the poison pill?

26:41.689 --> 26:43.361
Yes, but I don't think
it's gonna be enough.

26:43.529 --> 26:47.522
Phoebe, stop. All right, we need
to cover the exits, look for Carlton.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.004
If we see him grab anybody,

26:49.169 --> 26:51.239
Piper, freeze the room,
and we'll get into positions.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.320
I wish we could just stuff his head
in a toilet

26:53.489 --> 26:56.799
- and make him cough up the demon.
- Oh, honey, you still upset with Leo?

26:57.209 --> 27:00.963
- I'm talking about Carlton.
- I can't keep up.

27:03.329 --> 27:06.401
You brought witches to destroy me.

27:06.569 --> 27:09.288
What? What are you talking about?
No, I didn't. I swear!

27:09.449 --> 27:11.326
To whom do you swear?

27:14.049 --> 27:16.847
To you, just you.
I didn't know about the witches.

27:17.009 --> 27:19.807
Your most recent selection,
she holds the key

27:19.969 --> 27:22.608
to my destruction. Take it from her.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.682
But why? They know about you.
They know about me!

27:25.889 --> 27:29.802
Take it from her,
and bring the witches to me.

27:29.969 --> 27:31.925
All right, but how am
I gonna get them back here?

27:32.129 --> 27:33.881
I mean, they're gonna be
a little suspicious.

27:34.049 --> 27:37.246
Tempt them with an innocent soul.

27:41.849 --> 27:44.238
Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry.

27:45.329 --> 27:46.648
Pardon me.

27:50.449 --> 27:51.848
Excuse me.

27:53.369 --> 27:54.688
Sorry.

27:56.489 --> 27:58.798
Look, I'm sorry,
but if you don't have a ticket,

27:58.969 --> 28:01.358
and your name isn't on the guest list,
I can't let you in.

28:02.689 --> 28:06.602
Try looking under G for Grant.

28:09.089 --> 28:11.523
Oh, here you are, Mr Grant.

28:13.009 --> 28:14.362
Thank you so much.

28:19.009 --> 28:23.161
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for Dishwalla!

28:58.009 --> 29:00.648
- I wish you'd quit doing that.
- What's happening?

29:00.809 --> 29:03.403
We're on it, Leo. We're just waiting
for Carlton to do his thing.

29:03.569 --> 29:05.400
- What, you think I like this?
- Leo.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.161
You think I like not being with you?

29:07.329 --> 29:09.843
Can we cut the crap? I know
what you have to do. I always have.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.239
The question is, what do you want?
What do you wanna do?

29:12.409 --> 29:14.684
With me, with us?
Do you ever think about that?

29:14.849 --> 29:17.124
- All the time.
- You ever wanna discuss it with me?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.757
Yes, it's just the timing
always seems...

29:22.609 --> 29:26.488
Seems to suck. Okay, hold that
thought. Don't let go, just hold it.

29:31.849 --> 29:33.441
Morris is here.

29:35.889 --> 29:37.561
Oh, boy.

29:37.849 --> 29:40.488
What are you looking at?
He's over there.

29:40.649 --> 29:42.526
Yeah, okay, come, come.

29:49.969 --> 29:51.846
See that honey by the stage
in the silver thing?

29:52.369 --> 29:54.087
- Yeah.
- She's got something in her purse.

29:54.289 --> 29:56.405
- Something illegal?
- Extremely. Get it out of here.

29:56.609 --> 29:58.327
You got it. Let's go.

30:03.249 --> 30:05.001
Hey, what are you doing?

30:05.169 --> 30:07.524
- Weapons check.
- There is nothing in there.

30:11.449 --> 30:15.920
- What the hell is that?
- That is a $75 dry cleaning bill.

30:23.209 --> 30:26.758
Hey, there, Jenny?
Hello. I remember you.

30:26.929 --> 30:28.760
You're a friend of Piper Halliwell's,
right?

30:28.969 --> 30:32.086
And Phoebe and Prue.
We're like sisters.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.001
Listen, would you like
to meet the band?

30:34.649 --> 30:38.164
Are you serious?
Man, I'd do anything to meet them!

30:38.809 --> 30:39.924
Follow me.

30:54.409 --> 30:55.637
Hello, Prue.

30:57.369 --> 30:59.007
- Mr Barker.
- Where's Phoebe?

30:59.209 --> 31:02.201
- Let me guess. Piper Halliwell, right?
- Yeah. Who are you? Who's he?

31:02.369 --> 31:03.563
The name's Chris Barker.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.879
I'm gonna be taking over everything
from here on out.

31:06.049 --> 31:07.926
- Wait, what?
- Piper, we gotta talk.

31:08.249 --> 31:09.284
Not now.

31:09.449 --> 31:11.679
I'd be willing to discuss
you staying on, however,

31:11.849 --> 31:13.965
in a diminished capacity, of course.

31:14.129 --> 31:15.608
- Jenny's here with Carlton.
- What?

31:15.769 --> 31:17.600
- Jenny's here?
- And I've lost the potion.

31:17.769 --> 31:19.839
- Piper, it's important.
- Yeah, wait in line, pal.

31:20.009 --> 31:21.488
Hey, why don't you step to the back.

31:21.649 --> 31:23.799
Okay, everybody hold it.

31:29.369 --> 31:30.688
Look.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.607
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.879
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

31:43.009 --> 31:44.761
Freeze them again,
they're through the door!

31:45.409 --> 31:46.683
Hey!

31:49.489 --> 31:50.888
Hello?

32:03.609 --> 32:05.406
- Hold it. Stop.
- Jenny's in there.

32:05.569 --> 32:07.799
Yeah, but we can't kill Masselin
without the potion.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.721
But we can't just stand here.
She's gonna die.

32:21.609 --> 32:22.883
- Help us.
- He'll kill me.

32:23.049 --> 32:25.165
He'll burn the flesh
off my bones for eternity.

32:25.809 --> 32:28.403
Listen up, skid mark,
you tell us how to save Jenny

32:28.569 --> 32:29.888
and get Elvis out of the building,

32:30.049 --> 32:32.483
or spending eternity in hell
will be the least of your worries.

32:32.649 --> 32:34.879
- There's nothing you can do.
- We can break the pact

32:35.049 --> 32:37.358
and free you from Masselin.

32:38.929 --> 32:40.840
Believe me, if I could help you,
I would.

32:41.089 --> 32:44.764
If you go in there, he's gonna swallow
you whole. And you'll still be alive.

32:45.209 --> 32:46.608
That's not a bad idea.

32:46.969 --> 32:48.607
- What?
- Where's the demon?

32:52.209 --> 32:54.040
Through that door.

32:54.209 --> 32:56.439
I got a plan. We get eaten.

32:56.929 --> 32:58.282
I'm sorry, we get what?

32:58.449 --> 33:01.407
And once we're inside, Prue, you
use your power to blow him up.

33:01.569 --> 33:02.968
From the inside?

33:03.289 --> 33:05.883
Who's to say that we don't lose
our powers once we get in there?

33:06.049 --> 33:07.801
Maybe that's exactly what he wants.

33:08.009 --> 33:11.718
Well, we don't really have a choice,
Phoebe. The poison pill is gone.

33:13.169 --> 33:14.443
Is it?

33:18.289 --> 33:19.563
Phoebe, what are you...?

33:26.409 --> 33:29.924
It's time to join your friend, witches.

33:30.849 --> 33:31.918
Your friend.

33:42.009 --> 33:44.045
What is going on back here?

33:54.369 --> 33:55.688
Jenny.

33:58.649 --> 34:01.243
Come on, we gotta get her home.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.083
Little dizzy.

34:05.329 --> 34:07.320
Prue, what's going on here?

34:08.649 --> 34:11.482
- Someone wanna clue me in?
- You're arresting a kidnapper.

34:12.208 --> 34:14.848
And rescuing his victims.
Good job.

34:16.849 --> 34:19.204
Trust me, that's all you wanna know.

34:20.649 --> 34:22.719
I guess that's all I need to know.

34:28.768 --> 34:30.121
Mr Barker,

34:30.609 --> 34:31.962
here's what you need to know.

34:32.329 --> 34:35.764
This place is ours, the ups, the downs,
the good, and especially the bad.

34:36.049 --> 34:39.280
It's all ours.
Now, if you ever bother us again,

34:39.529 --> 34:42.804
you won't have to ask
if I'm threatening you. Are we clear?

34:43.049 --> 34:45.119
- Yeah.
- Good.

36:00.889 --> 36:02.288
Paying bills?

36:02.529 --> 36:05.123
Every last one,
for this month at least.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.642
Thanks to Leo.

36:07.209 --> 36:09.006
Well, technically, if it wasn't for him,

36:09.169 --> 36:10.921
you would have never landed
Dishwalla.

36:11.129 --> 36:15.600
I suppose. And technically,
if we hadn't vanquished a demon,

36:15.929 --> 36:19.365
your client Chris Barker wouldn't have
abandoned his hostile takeover.

36:19.529 --> 36:22.089
The bank called
and told me Mr Barker

36:22.289 --> 36:25.565
didn't have the stomach
for gruesome stage theatrics.

36:25.729 --> 36:28.289
- He's withdrawing his offer.
- I'm sorry.

36:28.449 --> 36:31.600
He was just supposed to help.
We didn't expect a double-cross.

36:32.329 --> 36:33.603
It's okay.

36:33.929 --> 36:36.602
I mean, I understand why you
didn't wanna hurt my feelings,

36:36.769 --> 36:38.487
but you could've told me the truth.

36:38.649 --> 36:41.083
- I said I was sorry.
- We're sorry.

36:42.009 --> 36:44.842
It's just dawning on me
that personal relationships

36:45.009 --> 36:47.523
and business
just don't mix well at all.

36:48.609 --> 36:49.962
I got it.

36:53.009 --> 36:55.364
Why were you trying
to blame it all on me?

36:59.809 --> 37:01.640
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:02.889 --> 37:06.165
Thanks for everything.

37:07.329 --> 37:10.765
Just doing my job.
Do you wanna come in, sit down?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.362
I'd love to.

37:13.329 --> 37:14.808
But you can't.

37:15.729 --> 37:19.483
We got Jenny home safe.
Dan doesn't know she was at the club.

37:19.769 --> 37:21.839
But are you sure
she won't remember anything?

37:22.209 --> 37:24.643
I took care of it
with a little hocus-pocus.

37:25.889 --> 37:27.607
So you erase memories now?

37:28.009 --> 37:29.283
No, I make pain go away...

37:30.529 --> 37:34.044
...when I can.
Sometimes I can't,

37:34.769 --> 37:36.202
no matter how hard I try.

37:36.369 --> 37:39.327
- And Masselin's other victims?
- They'll be fine.

37:39.529 --> 37:42.680
- No memory of Masselin or Carlton.
- Good.

37:44.369 --> 37:46.280
Piper, did you mean what you said?

37:48.329 --> 37:50.604
- When?
- A couple of months ago,

37:50.769 --> 37:53.602
when I almost died and you
saved my life, I left, and you said

37:54.009 --> 37:55.761
that you love me.

37:56.849 --> 37:58.328
I thought you were gone.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.406
Well, sometimes I linger.

38:02.289 --> 38:04.200
Did you mean it?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.882
Yeah, I meant it.

38:08.009 --> 38:10.842
- You linger?
- What about now?

38:13.969 --> 38:15.402
I still mean it.

38:16.049 --> 38:18.483
- But...?
- But we can't keep doing this.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.603
I can't keep doing this.
I feel like all I do

38:21.809 --> 38:24.846
is wait around for you to show up.
And then when you do, it's just not

38:25.009 --> 38:26.328
quite right.

38:26.489 --> 38:30.243
Well, I'm just... I'm doing what
I thought you wanted me to do, Piper.

38:30.849 --> 38:33.283
You're the one who didn't want me
to clip my wings.

38:34.009 --> 38:38.161
And you shouldn't, not for me, but
that doesn't make it any easier for us.

38:41.529 --> 38:43.884
What are we gonna do?

38:45.849 --> 38:47.282
I don't know, Leo.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.883
Go. It's okay. I understand.

39:00.689 --> 39:02.281
I'll see you.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
