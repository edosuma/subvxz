00:21.889 --> 00:23.022
- This land used to be some of

00:23.024 --> 00:25.424
the most fertile
farmland in the country,

00:25.426 --> 00:27.793
though it's hard to
believe that now.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.496
It's been years since
it last rained here.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.766
The news called it
an isolated cataclysm

00:33.768 --> 00:35.934
or some shit like that.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.636
Means the rest of the
world went on living

00:37.638 --> 00:40.305
while we were left here
to fend for ourselves.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.174
Suck the one necessary
ingredient for life

00:42.176 --> 00:45.544
out of a place and life
seems to leave with it.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.313
When the fields dried
up and the cattle died,

00:48.315 --> 00:49.681
people tried to
sell and the ones

00:49.683 --> 00:51.216
who couldn't were left behind.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.219
It only took months for
us to turn on each other,

00:54.221 --> 00:56.622
and, oh, how we did.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.190
You can know someone
your whole life,

00:58.192 --> 01:02.561
but the second it's you, or
them, watch how you change.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.198
There's always been
talk of who's to blame.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.400
Some people blame
the government.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.003
Others think God did this to us.

01:11.005 --> 01:13.939
But truth be told, we
did it to ourselves.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.308
We left this land desolate.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.788
- Did you find out anything?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.064
- Nope.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.537
They done yet?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.274
- Not quite.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.287
- Hide in the back,
Ned, and make it look nice.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.721
- Oh, 'cause he cares.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.959
You think I wanna
still be doing this?

03:14.762 --> 03:15.827
- Just do it.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.633
- I don't even know
how to do this.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.373
Billy, get over here, help.

03:29.944 --> 03:30.842
Come here!

03:34.715 --> 03:36.381
Why don't you take your time?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.616
Come on, lift his head.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.785
Lift his head.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.590
What's the matter,
you can't look at him?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.292
This is your brother.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.494
Show him some respect.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.616
- They shot him with a
12-gauge from behind.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.252
- And Shelly was with him.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.922
- Where is she now?

04:18.058 --> 04:18.957
- Gone.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.764
- Alright, from now on,
everyone stands watch.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.569
- That means you too, Billy.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.476
- You finish his coffin and
we bury him in the morning.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.649
Alright, go on and
relieve your brother.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.509
- May you go in peace, boy.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.179
And may you rest
eternally as God

05:14.181 --> 05:18.483
has willed you from
our pasture to his.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.958
Would you like to
say a few words?

05:32.399 --> 05:36.635
- There was a time
when I might have

05:36.637 --> 05:41.473
cried out and said, "Lord, why?"

05:43.711 --> 05:44.643
Why me?

05:47.414 --> 05:48.447
Why us?

05:51.318 --> 05:56.388
If this is what the
Lord wants, so be it.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.345
- Duke!

07:00.187 --> 07:01.086
- What is it?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.289
- I found out who
killed your boy.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.391
- Who?

07:08.796 --> 07:09.761
- It's Jeb Turner.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.397
He's the one who
pulled the trigger.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.403
Duke, Duke!

07:23.277 --> 07:25.477
- I've never trusted
those bastards.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.881
You ride out tomorrow
and you don't

07:29.883 --> 07:34.486
come back here till
every Turner is dead.

07:34.488 --> 07:35.654
You understand me?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.324
Do you understand me?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.292
- Yes, sir.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.900
- Make sure Jeb Turner's
bullet comes from my gun.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.337
- Yes, sir.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.910
What about the kid?

08:01.748 --> 08:02.747
- Leave him.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.417
I'll need him to stand watch.

08:14.228 --> 08:17.562
- You must be sad and
lonely more than ever.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.437
At least you're here this time.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.576
- What, is that supposed
to make it better?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.176
- Kyle?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.144
- Get down!

09:57.798 --> 09:59.264
- Did you get it?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.170
- Hard to tell.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.372
Get in the truck.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.651
- When I
was a little girl

10:19.653 --> 10:22.487
I used to lay in
the grass for hours

10:22.489 --> 10:25.757
and just watch the
rain clouds roll by.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.494
They always looked so busy.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.798
Like they had somewhere to go.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.104
- My brothers are out.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.874
I only have a few hours
till I have to be back.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.349
Shelly and Johnny,
they were here

10:52.619 --> 10:56.655
two days ago and now
they're just erased.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.457
Disappeared.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.495
Around here people either
get erased or forgotten.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.634
They think it was the Turners.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.319
- Get to the house.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.187
Now!

11:30.424 --> 11:31.322
Run!

11:32.693 --> 11:34.859
- What are we supposed
to do, just sit around

11:34.861 --> 11:38.363
and wait for everyone
to die around here?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.736
I can't live like
this anymore, Kayla.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.611
- How long our families
known each other?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.947
- We just wanted the girl.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.248
- Where is she?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.116
- I don't know.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.252
We just grab the girls
and they pick 'em up.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.456
We're all just trying to get by.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.925
- You shot him in the back, Jeb.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.127
- Enough blood's been spilled.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.528
- You shot him in the back!

12:12.299 --> 12:13.164
For what?

12:23.977 --> 12:26.211
No!

12:26.213 --> 12:27.112
No!

12:39.459 --> 12:40.959
And though I walk in the valley

12:40.961 --> 12:43.161
of the shadow of death
I shall fear no evil.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.729
For thou art with me.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.032
They rod and thy
staff they comfort me.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.736
- Those things
don't work anymore, Jeb.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.973
- Go on.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.307
Get it over with.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.628
- Go check the property.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.207
- Look at this.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.145
- That could buy us a year,
maybe get an acre in the ground.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.680
- Bullshit, that right
there is the last

14:42.682 --> 14:45.416
green thing we're ever
gonna see in this field.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.018
That gets us out of here.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.786
- Yeah, well, you're gonna need

14:48.788 --> 14:50.288
a lot more than that
to get us outta here.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.124
- Look at this, I
think there is more.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.726
Every one of these spots on here

14:54.728 --> 14:58.229
is a stash house including
the Turner ranch.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.800
And these are all on farms
where the drought affected them.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.937
Except for this one,
this one's different.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.644
I think they're funneling
stuff through here.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.512
I think this is
where we have to go.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.284
- Go get your brother
and let's go inside.

15:21.655 --> 15:22.553
- Where is he?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.622
- He's on watch.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.759
- Not when we came in.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.510
- I heard something
out back in the field

15:45.512 --> 15:46.878
so I went to check it out.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.521
- Don't lie to me, boy.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.430
Where have you been?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.436
- I went to see, Kayla, sir.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.608
- You leave your watch
and waste what little gas

16:17.610 --> 16:21.980
we have left to go
see that little bitch?

16:38.098 --> 16:38.997
- Bitch.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.511
- Get hold of him.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.595
I don't think you understand
what it means to be a Stone.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.365
It's not just a name.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.467
You need to learn that.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.270
- Kyle!

17:19.271 --> 17:20.171
Kyle!

17:21.708 --> 17:23.508
- Pull up his shirt.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.642
- Kyle, Kyle!

18:05.518 --> 18:08.019
- Hey, relax, it's just me.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.425
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.829
What?

18:17.831 --> 18:18.963
- Didn't
you hold me down?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.465
- What was I supposed
to do, Billy?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.699
- Didn't you hold me down?
- What was I supposed to do?

18:21.701 --> 18:23.301
Look, man, I wanna
watch your back.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.636
But when you pull shit
like you did last night

18:25.638 --> 18:27.238
I can't fucking help you!

18:28.575 --> 18:29.841
- I don't need your help.

18:29.843 --> 18:32.176
- Shut your mouth
and listen to me!

18:32.178 --> 18:34.378
Duke asked me to come get you.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.813
Do you know what that means?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.585
Look, you want out.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.453
I get it.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.657
Stop acting like a fucking kid.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.494
And start being a man.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.133
Don't put me in that
situation again.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.438
Let's go.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.010
- Everything out
here, it's abandoned.

19:06.012 --> 19:09.280
But this right here,
that's the wild card.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.515
- Kent County.
- Yeah.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.416
- How far is that?

19:12.418 --> 19:13.885
- Three, 350.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.620
- Well, how
much gas we got left?

19:15.622 --> 19:17.588
- We got
enough for one bike.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.690
- What's that gonna do us?

19:19.692 --> 19:20.591
- Look, I'll go.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.194
- You're not going alone.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.428
- Nobody's gotta go alone.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.730
We got enough gas
to get us there.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.565
We'll just refuel
on the way back.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.534
- Yeah, what if
the station's dry?

19:29.536 --> 19:32.670
- Someone finds out that
we got this map, it's over.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.174
- Who keeps that
much gas around here?

19:37.177 --> 19:38.242
- A meth cook would.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.578
- I think you need
to learn to speak

19:40.580 --> 19:42.346
when spoken to, Billy.
- Shut up.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.053
- A meth cook would
keep that much, sir.

19:49.055 --> 19:49.954
- He's right.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.657
They use it to
cook their product.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.592
- Raymond.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.894
Raymond would have it.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.831
I don't like it, but,
it's where we're at.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.206
- Okay then, get going.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.275
- Let's do it.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.411
- Take Billy with you.

20:16.015 --> 20:16.981
- Let's go.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.994
- You ride with your
brothers from now on.

20:32.065 --> 20:32.964
- Yes, sir.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.574
It's some kind of
job outside of town.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.143
- Where to?

20:46.145 --> 20:47.378

21:12.772 --> 21:14.038
They're making me do this.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.471
We just, we need
something quick.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.275
Maybe you can help
an old friend out?

23:03.349 --> 23:05.683
We're just trying to
get by, you know, Ray?

23:05.685 --> 23:06.550
That's all.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.419
Look at you, man.

23:09.689 --> 23:10.788
You're the king here.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.159
- Long time, Ky.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.363
- Long time.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.201
- A fucking long time!

23:25.605 --> 23:28.672
And now you little fuckers
wanna get in the game, huh?

23:31.010 --> 23:31.909
Okay.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.979
How you wanna get started?

23:34.981 --> 23:36.414
Eight string,
oxtail, Lucy glass?

23:36.416 --> 23:37.615
I got it all, man.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.816
Oh, we even got these
sweet fucking guns

23:38.818 --> 23:40.317
these chinks just gave
us for some smack.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.353
- No, man, just the glass.

23:42.355 --> 23:43.487
Just the glass.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.724
- Alright, we got glass.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.925
We got good fucking glass.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.959
Why don't you give it a shot?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.132
- I trust you.

23:55.133 --> 23:55.865
- I don't give a
fuck if you trust me.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.067
How the fuck you
gonna sell my shit,

23:57.069 --> 23:58.269
you don't know what
it tastes like?

24:09.415 --> 24:10.281
Good boy.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.832
Okay, just the crystal.

24:29.001 --> 24:29.900
- That's it, man.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.503
- They're really nice
fucking guns, man.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.071
You sure you don't
want any fucking guns?

24:34.073 --> 24:34.905
- Ray.
- Baby, baby, baby, baby.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.073
- We're good, man.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.575
We're good, we're good.
- We're good, man.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.410
- Oh man, no, you
gotta check this shit out.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.048
- We're good, man,
just the glass.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.517
- Okay.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.323
How much you wanna start with?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.098
Alright.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.568
You motherfuckers think
you're big time, huh?

25:04.570 --> 25:06.804
Baby, why don't you
hit that stove up?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.772
We got some cookin' to do.
- Alright!

25:10.376 --> 25:13.344
- You motherfuckers
think you're big time!

25:13.346 --> 25:15.312
You motherfuckers think
you're fucking big time!

25:15.314 --> 25:17.114
You motherfuckers
think you're big time?

25:17.116 --> 25:17.948
Huh, huh?
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

25:19.051 --> 25:20.050
- Ray, hey!

25:20.052 --> 25:22.319
- Huh, huh?
- Ray, Ray!

25:22.321 --> 25:26.957
- You gonna fucking
die, big time!

25:26.959 --> 25:30.261
- Put the guns down,
put the guns down.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.466
- Fuck, man, I'm
fucking with you, relax!

25:35.468 --> 25:37.801
It's from Carlito's Way.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.503
You know Carlito's Way.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.272
You mean you never
seen that movie?

25:41.274 --> 25:42.473
You're missing out, man.

25:42.475 --> 25:43.774
That fucking movie
changed my life, man.

25:43.776 --> 25:44.708
- Ray.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.743
- I base my life on that movie.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.447
Shit made me the man I am today.

25:58.424 --> 25:59.590
Fuck, Deer Hunter!

25:59.592 --> 26:00.724
You know you've fucking
seen Deer Hunter!

26:00.726 --> 26:02.026
Have you seen Deer Hunter?

26:02.028 --> 26:02.993
Come on, even the little fucking

26:02.995 --> 26:04.895
shit's seen Deer Hunter, huh?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.363
Deer fucking Hunter,
let's play, huh?

26:06.365 --> 26:07.631
There's like, two or three
bullets in here, tops.

26:07.633 --> 26:08.766
- Ray, we're good, man.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.900
We're good, Ray.
- Come on, let's do it.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.235
- Ray, we're not gonna play.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.469
We're not gonna play any--

26:12.471 --> 26:13.737
- Oh, don't be such
a fucking faggot!

26:13.739 --> 26:14.905
- Ray, put it down.
- We're having some

26:14.907 --> 26:16.140
fucking fun here!
- Ray, put the gun down.

26:16.142 --> 26:16.941
- Come on!
- We gotta get out of here.

26:16.943 --> 26:17.741
- Ray, put the gun down.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.542
Put the gun down.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.144
- Fine, fine, fine.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.445
I'll go first, ready?

26:21.447 --> 26:24.081
Here we go.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.818
- Fuck!

26:27.820 --> 26:29.186
Alright, listen,
everybody breathe.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.421
You stay here.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.622
I'm going around to
grab it, alright?

26:31.624 --> 26:33.023
Everybody stay calm!
- Did you see that shit?

26:33.025 --> 26:33.958
- Did you see it?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.626
Get the gas, get the gas!

26:35.628 --> 26:37.595
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

26:37.597 --> 26:39.229
- Don't tell
me to shut up, Kyle!

26:39.231 --> 26:40.798
Get the gas and let's
get the fuck outta here!

27:01.621 --> 27:04.521
- Billy,
Billy, let's go!

27:27.713 --> 27:29.480
- Remember that time
he took us hunting?

27:30.583 --> 27:32.349
That thing swooped
down and knocked

27:32.351 --> 27:33.917
him clean out of the tree.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.586
He was so embarrassed
all he could

27:35.588 --> 27:37.421
do was just lay there going,

27:37.423 --> 27:39.990
don't just stand there,
shoot the bastard!

27:46.098 --> 27:48.766
- You know what I miss?

27:48.768 --> 27:50.100
Haunted Gulch Lake.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.504
- Gulch Lake's all dried up.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.007
- Yeah, I know.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.642
It wasn't always like that.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.384
Duke had this old Winchester
that he let us shoot on.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.189
It was how I learned
to shoot a gun.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.994
You only had to set
the trigger once.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.199
I miss that rifle.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.374
- That must have been nice.

28:31.911 --> 28:32.810
- Hey.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.114
I know you got the
short end of it.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.651
But he wasn't always like that.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.023
And when the rain
stopped falling

28:47.093 --> 28:48.726
and all the other farmers left,

28:50.429 --> 28:53.030
and the ones that didn't
abandoned their children

28:53.032 --> 28:54.331
and their wives
when they saw that

28:54.333 --> 28:57.034
they weren't gonna be
able to sell, he stayed,

28:58.170 --> 29:01.905
and he sweat and he
bled for his family.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.308
There's something
to be said for that.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.275
- Alright!

29:06.946 --> 29:09.379
You get your fill of
the good old days, hmm?

29:10.783 --> 29:13.383
I don't know about you, but
I'm thinking about tomorrow.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.284
Okay?

29:15.354 --> 29:16.754
I've had enough of
this story time shit.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.792
Parker, keep an eye open.

30:18.551 --> 30:21.018
- Alright,
this is the place.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.553
Billy, lose your helmet.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.790
You post up right there
and keep watch for us.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.259
No matter what happens
you stay by that door.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.570
Where's the fucking money?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.106
Where's the fucking money?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.674
- Kyle, what the
fuck is this shit, man?

31:17.676 --> 31:18.942
- Where's the money?
- There's no one here.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.245
- Where's the
money, man, you hear me?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.748
- Hey, look at me!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.116
Where's the fucking money?

31:28.187 --> 31:29.987
- Where's the money, man?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.388
You hear me, where's
the fucking money?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.023
You speak English,
where's the fucking money?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.291
- Come on, man!

31:34.293 --> 31:35.225
- Come on,
where's the money?

31:35.227 --> 31:36.426
Where's the fucking money?

31:37.529 --> 31:41.098
- Let's go, let's
go, let's go, come on!

31:56.148 --> 31:57.948
What is this shit?

31:57.950 --> 31:58.916
- What is this shit?

31:58.918 --> 32:00.350
Where's the fucking money?

32:00.352 --> 32:04.321
- Put guns down and
leave store now.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.026
- Fuck this.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.160
- Put your
fucking helmet on!

32:12.064 --> 32:13.196
Fuck!

32:13.198 --> 32:14.464
Way to go, Ned!

32:14.466 --> 32:15.666
Now he's gonna tell us!

32:16.802 --> 32:18.268
- It's gotta be here.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.102
It's gotta be here!

32:19.104 --> 32:20.037
Where is it?

32:20.039 --> 32:20.771
- What are you doing?

32:20.773 --> 32:22.339
Get back here!

32:22.341 --> 32:23.807
- I got something in here!

32:23.809 --> 32:25.275
- What, what is it?

32:25.277 --> 32:26.777
- I don't know, I don't
know what I'm looking at.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.179
- Gun!

32:30.916 --> 32:32.482
Fuck!

32:32.484 --> 32:33.550
- What do we do now?

32:35.054 --> 32:36.253
- You guys, we
gotta get out of here.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.721
Someone for sure heard that!

32:38.791 --> 32:40.724
Holy shit.

32:40.726 --> 32:41.625
This is here.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.527
There's gotta be another room.

32:43.529 --> 32:44.628
Look for a door.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.998
Look for another door!

32:57.309 --> 32:59.276
- I found a door!

33:00.879 --> 33:02.646
I need a key!

33:02.648 --> 33:04.514
- We need a key!

33:07.019 --> 33:07.884
- Hold on!

33:11.757 --> 33:12.556
Fuck!

33:16.161 --> 33:17.227
I got a key!

33:21.033 --> 33:23.667
Out of the way, out of the way!

33:47.426 --> 33:49.359
- Are they in there?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.428
I don't like this, Kyle.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.782
- Jesus Christ!

34:14.652 --> 34:17.286
- This
is some shit, man.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.090
- Get 'em out of here.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.795
- Money!

34:25.797 --> 34:28.098
Look at all the money, man.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.400
Look at that!

34:31.402 --> 34:34.071
- Easy, I'm getting
you out of here, okay?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.505
Was there a girl here?

34:35.507 --> 34:38.041
She has blonde hair, she's
about your age, did you see her?

34:38.043 --> 34:40.377
- Come on, let's go!

34:43.581 --> 34:45.581
- Take a bag,
fill it, let's go!

34:56.762 --> 34:58.795
- Guys, come on, we
gotta go right now!

34:58.797 --> 35:00.430
Someone's here,
let's go, let's go!

35:00.432 --> 35:02.199
- One bag each,
let's go, let's go!

35:02.201 --> 35:03.467
- Take the shit, man!

35:03.469 --> 35:05.802
- Let's go, let's go!

35:07.306 --> 35:10.140
Come on, come on,
go, go, go, go!

35:21.553 --> 35:22.452
Fuck!

35:23.555 --> 35:25.422
- Billy, Billy's hit!

35:25.424 --> 35:26.456
- Shit!

35:26.458 --> 35:28.525
Go, go, I got him!

35:28.527 --> 35:30.293
Take the money!

35:30.295 --> 35:31.895
I got him, go!

35:38.103 --> 35:39.402
- Ned, help me!

35:40.405 --> 35:41.972
Ned, help, please!

35:43.275 --> 35:44.875
Ned, wait, Ned!

35:44.877 --> 35:45.775
Ned!

36:12.437 --> 36:14.337
- Where
the fuck is Billy?

36:14.339 --> 36:15.839
- He didn't make it!

36:15.841 --> 36:19.976
- What do you
mean he didn't make it?

37:23.475 --> 37:25.342
- What do we do, man?

37:25.344 --> 37:27.177
- We can't leave
him, we gotta do something!

37:28.113 --> 37:29.579
- Please, please.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.082
No!

37:32.084 --> 37:32.882
- Fuck!

37:32.884 --> 37:33.717
- Oh, God!

37:33.719 --> 37:35.518
- Let's go, go!

40:05.203 --> 40:06.703
- What are you doing, man?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.571
Hey, we gotta keep going.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.542
- Where, huh?

40:13.545 --> 40:14.644
We got no way out.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.083
This is the only
road out of here.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.285
And they own it, Ned.

40:23.889 --> 40:24.788
Look at me.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.023
We gotta lay low.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.059
We gotta ditch these bikes.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.262
We gotta get some ammo.

40:35.667 --> 40:36.566
- Okay.

41:19.811 --> 41:20.710
- Parker.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.054
- Mmm!

43:12.457 --> 43:14.457
Now, that's a burger!

43:14.459 --> 43:18.861
When's the last time
you had a burger, man?

43:24.603 --> 43:26.369
You ain't gonna touch your food?

43:32.577 --> 43:34.577
Come on, man, we did it.

43:34.579 --> 43:36.479
We pulled it off.

43:36.481 --> 43:37.780
Right?

43:37.782 --> 43:39.415
- Are you outta your mind?

43:39.417 --> 43:41.551
This is not a fucking
time to celebrate.

43:41.553 --> 43:42.719
- Are you kidding me?

43:43.722 --> 43:45.021
Are you kidding me?

43:45.023 --> 43:46.589
- You think this is over, huh?

43:47.692 --> 43:49.058
You think you're just
gonna eat this meal

43:49.060 --> 43:50.960
and waltz right outta here?

43:50.962 --> 43:52.595
These people are comin' for us.

43:53.732 --> 43:56.065
And Parker is dead
and Billy is dead.

43:56.067 --> 43:56.966
Okay?

44:01.406 --> 44:03.873
- Well, that's not on me.

44:06.211 --> 44:06.910
That's on you.

44:06.911 --> 44:07.610
You're the one who
said let's go to Kent.

44:07.612 --> 44:08.611
Well, we went Kent.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.016
What'd you think was
gonna happen, man?

44:14.319 --> 44:16.519
You think we were just
gonna walk in and walk out?

44:19.691 --> 44:20.657
What's the matter?

44:20.659 --> 44:22.425
You got a little guilt on you?

44:22.427 --> 44:23.326
Hmm, hmm?

45:36.668 --> 45:38.167
- Where are they?

46:25.250 --> 46:28.050
- Couldn't take you to a
hospital for obvious reasons.

46:28.052 --> 46:30.353
You're lucky, though, it
was clean, in and out.

46:38.229 --> 46:39.128
I'm Van.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.269
I'm not here to kill you, kid.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.070
If I wanted you
dead I would have

46:48.072 --> 46:50.106
let your two buddies
finish you off.

46:50.108 --> 46:51.607
- I need to go.

46:51.609 --> 46:52.909
- Slow down, you're not
going anywhere like this.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.977
- I need a phone.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.380
- Okay, there's a
phone just over there.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.584
But you go slow or you're
gonna split yourself open.

47:29.647 --> 47:31.214
- Please, pick up.

47:48.566 --> 47:51.601
- Head out to the
desert, mile marker 201.

47:51.603 --> 47:54.136
There's three bodies
there, grave's already dug.

47:54.138 --> 47:57.306
Now, there's a truck there and
the keys are in the ignition.

47:57.308 --> 47:58.341
Clean it up.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.242
- You got it.

48:05.617 --> 48:06.515
- Yeah?

48:09.320 --> 48:11.120
I'll need the security tapes.

48:11.122 --> 48:12.054
What's the number?

48:17.262 --> 48:19.595
Alright, I'll pick it
up in a little bit.

48:22.867 --> 48:24.500
Okay, got it.

48:24.502 --> 48:25.401
I gotta go.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.773
- I appreciate all you've done,

48:30.775 --> 48:32.775
but I have to get out of here.

48:38.483 --> 48:40.950
- I don't know what kind of
trouble you think you're in.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.318
This isn't over for you.

48:43.755 --> 48:46.422
They're gonna come after
everyone you know to find you.

48:50.161 --> 48:51.961
The only way for me to help you

48:51.963 --> 48:53.729
is if you tell me
what's going on.

49:04.042 --> 49:05.641
Okay, suit yourself.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.578
- Wait.

49:11.683 --> 49:12.515
Hold on.

49:22.493 --> 49:23.492
- I know a kid like
you doesn't get

49:23.494 --> 49:25.394
into shit this deep on your own.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.901
- We don't get to choose
our family, do we?

49:35.406 --> 49:36.305
- Brothers?

49:37.976 --> 49:38.841
- Three.

49:47.085 --> 49:47.984
Two.

50:07.772 --> 50:09.905
- And the other
two, they just left you?

50:13.478 --> 50:14.377
- Yeah.

50:20.852 --> 50:22.218
- Can't get ahold of Duke.

50:26.124 --> 50:27.790
- You any idea where they are?

50:32.263 --> 50:33.162
- No.

50:36.634 --> 50:37.833
- Oh, yeah.

50:42.106 --> 50:43.089
- Ned?

50:43.090 --> 50:44.073
- I always wanted
to do that.

50:45.176 --> 50:48.210
- If you act like a fool
and you call attention

50:48.212 --> 50:51.180
to yourself you're gonna
get yourself killed.

50:54.986 --> 50:57.620
- You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore, Kyle.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.690
We're not on the farm anymore.

51:03.828 --> 51:04.693
Understand?

51:15.606 --> 51:19.041
- I'm gonna ditch my bike and
then I'm gonna bury my money

51:20.144 --> 51:22.078
so I have something
to trade my life for.

51:24.482 --> 51:26.048
I suggest you do the same.

51:36.661 --> 51:37.860
- Oh, I almost forgot.

51:40.098 --> 51:41.263
I think this is yours.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.973
So, how much did you have?

51:57.849 --> 52:01.484
- Uh, I don't know, I
was just the lookout.

52:06.991 --> 52:08.657
- Let's get
you out of here.

52:08.659 --> 52:10.226
I'm gonna take you to my place.

52:21.105 --> 52:22.004
You hungry?

52:25.109 --> 52:26.342
I have to make a stop real quick

52:26.344 --> 52:27.877
and then we can grab something.

52:29.247 --> 52:31.780
You make sure you stay out
of sight or we're both dead.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.600
- No, please, please.

53:26.137 --> 53:27.169
Please.

53:38.316 --> 53:39.882
- Give them to me.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.054
- I don't know.

53:45.890 --> 53:48.257
I don't know where they are.

53:48.259 --> 53:49.992
I don't know.

53:49.994 --> 53:51.126
I don't know!

53:54.065 --> 53:56.465
- If you lie I will kill you.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.236
If you resist I will kill you.

54:01.505 --> 54:05.040
If you try to leave
I will kill you.

54:10.281 --> 54:11.647
- I'm not lying.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.116
I'm not lying.

54:15.286 --> 54:17.319
He was supposed to come back.

54:18.623 --> 54:20.322
And he didn't.

54:20.324 --> 54:22.391
He never came back, I promise.

54:23.995 --> 54:24.893
I promise.

54:34.171 --> 54:35.070
No!

55:01.132 --> 55:03.032
- I don't mess with bikes.

55:03.834 --> 55:04.733
What do you want?

55:14.679 --> 55:15.978
Sexy, isn't it?

55:15.980 --> 55:17.846
- Is she as
fast as she looks?

55:18.716 --> 55:20.249
- Can't tell you how

55:20.251 --> 55:22.084
many times this
sucker's gotten me laid.

55:23.621 --> 55:26.588
- Where do you get a piece of
ass in this town, anyway, huh?

55:30.294 --> 55:33.195
- I would recommend the
truck stop out on the 9.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.266
- Where's that?

55:37.268 --> 55:39.268
- It's about 20
minutes from here.

55:39.270 --> 55:40.869
Second exit on the right.

55:40.871 --> 55:42.805
Come back on the access road.

55:43.774 --> 55:45.607
Well, what do you think?

55:45.609 --> 55:46.508
Do you want it?

55:50.214 --> 55:51.113
- I'll take it.

56:03.127 --> 56:05.894
- You always eat up
here with the crows?

56:05.896 --> 56:06.795
- No, first time.

56:08.099 --> 56:09.498
I don't know how much
heat's on you so I'm waiting

56:09.500 --> 56:11.700
to see if anyone shows
up before we go in.

56:13.037 --> 56:13.936
- Makes sense.

56:19.276 --> 56:20.576
So what do you do?

56:21.812 --> 56:22.911
- I'm between jobs.

56:26.317 --> 56:27.282
- You got family?

56:29.019 --> 56:30.386
- No wife, no kids.

56:32.022 --> 56:32.588
What about you?

56:35.926 --> 56:36.825
You got a girl?

56:39.930 --> 56:41.497
That is who you called, right?

56:46.103 --> 56:47.202
Never mind, I get it.

56:51.842 --> 56:52.741
- Kayla.

56:54.078 --> 56:54.977
Name's Kayla.

56:57.481 --> 56:59.948
- It's a pretty name.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.183
Is she pretty?

57:03.888 --> 57:05.454
- She's beautiful.

57:06.590 --> 57:07.790
- What, are you in
love or something?

57:08.726 --> 57:10.459
Come on, you're just a kid.

57:11.562 --> 57:12.795
- Does that make a difference?

57:15.833 --> 57:17.065
- Would you die for her?

57:20.571 --> 57:21.437
- Yeah.

57:22.940 --> 57:23.839
She's everything.

57:32.883 --> 57:36.552
You think you can help
me find my brothers?

57:37.721 --> 57:39.455
- That would depend.

57:41.725 --> 57:43.358
- They left me for dead.

57:44.728 --> 57:47.429
The way I see it they may as
well have pulled the trigger.

57:47.431 --> 57:50.666
If it weren't for them I would
have made it back to her.

57:55.506 --> 57:57.473
Look, I don't know
how much they took,

57:57.475 --> 58:00.509
but I know it's gotta be a lot.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.481
You help me find
them, it's yours.

58:08.552 --> 58:10.118
- You got it, kid.

58:42.186 --> 58:45.420
- Come on, get
out, get out, go!

59:09.046 --> 59:09.945
- Kayla?

59:12.416 --> 59:13.315
Kayla!

59:29.767 --> 59:31.400
- Hey, hey, hey!

59:31.402 --> 59:32.301
Kyle!

59:35.839 --> 59:37.272
Check it out, man!

59:37.274 --> 59:39.074
- What the hell, Ned!
- Look at the panty dropper!

59:39.076 --> 59:40.275
- What is this, man?

59:40.277 --> 59:42.210
- You said ditch my
bike, I ditched my bike.

59:42.212 --> 59:43.979
Hell's comin' for us,
might as well take

59:43.981 --> 59:46.048
a little slice of heaven
before we go, right?

59:46.050 --> 59:48.250
- Ned, get out of
here with this thing.

59:48.252 --> 59:50.118
You just wanna die, is that it?

59:50.120 --> 59:52.854
You're drivin' around
in a blue camaro?

59:52.856 --> 59:54.089
You're my brother
but I'm not gonna

59:54.091 --> 59:56.291
let you get me fucking killed.

59:56.293 --> 59:59.428
Is this what you do, you turn
your back on your family?

59:59.430 --> 01:00:00.329
- Family?

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.366
Look around, man.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:06.101
I'm the only family
you got left.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.073
Get in.

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:16.511
- Just get outta here
with this thing, Ned.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.419
- We'll see you around, brother.

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.102
- Come on in.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:57.986
- You mind if I take a shower?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.489
- Yeah, of course,
it's right there.

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:02.424
Oh, let me get you some clothes.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.967
Yeah, that should
do it, here you go.

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:12.768
- Thanks.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:28.744
- Yeah, I just watched it.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.490
Okay, got it, Route 9.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.562
Hey, I gotta take care of some
stuff, I'll be out for a bit.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.431
Just make yourself
at home, okay?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.766
- Okay, thanks.

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:06.368
- Here.

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.939
- Father didn't know anything.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:12.007
We killed him.

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:16.912
- And the girl?

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.950
- We grabbed her when we
went looking for them.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.120
He'll come looking for her.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:27.022
- Is she here?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.991
- Yeah, at the restaurant.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:01.556
- Okay, I'll find them for you,

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.526
but I want half up
front, like the last job.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:08.063
- No, you do the
work, I got you paid.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:10.465
- No deal.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.773
You think you're safe 'cause
you took my fucking gun?

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.508
I'll kill you with
my bare hands!

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:23.778
- Here.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:10.625
- Can I help you?

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.497
- That's a Winchester, isn't it?

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:19.968
- Yeah, what about it?

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:00.508
- What are you doing?
- Get out of the car now!

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.210
- What, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get out!

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.278
- Easy, easy!
- Go!

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.512
Put the gun down, man.
- Go, go!

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.082
- Just take
it, take it, go, geez!

01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:28.296
- Come on.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:31.966
Shelly?

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.636
Shelly?
- Ned.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:37.438
Ned, please!

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.774
Please, you need to
help me get out of here!

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:42.443
Kayla's here, I saw
her here last night.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.312
They have her here,
too, the two of us!

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.356
They killed Johnny
in front of me--

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.391
- Shut up.

01:09:56.393 --> 01:09:57.458
- And they took me here!
- Shut up!

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.960
- Come sit down,

01:09:58.962 --> 01:09:59.928
you have to talk to me!
- What are you doing here?

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:01.162
Get off me!
- Talk to me!

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:03.264
- Shh, shh, shh!

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:04.299
Shut up!

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:05.166
Shut up!

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:12.574
Shut up!

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:13.808
Shut up, shut up!

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:14.842
Shut up!

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:16.344
Shut up!

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:17.245
Shut up!

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.915
Shut up or you're gonna
get us both killed!

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:21.816
Shut up!

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:27.155
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:18.239
- This way, this way!

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.184
- Shut that bitch up

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:37.552
or I'll shut her
up for you, okay?

01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:16.090
- Hey, how you doing?

01:13:17.961 --> 01:13:18.860
- Help you?

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:38.880
- Billy?

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:41.048
Whoa, whoa, Billy!
- Gimme the gun!

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:41.949
- What are you doing?
- Gimme the gun!

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:43.551
- Hey!

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:44.919
- Where is he?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.087
Where's Ned?

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.688
- What?

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:48.856
- Where is he?

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:51.025
- I don't know where he is.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:51.893
He's gone.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:55.530
- You left me!

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:58.533
You left me, Kyle!

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.507
- Billy, you listen
to me right now.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.845
Ned told me you were dead.
- Bullshit!

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.547
Don't fucking play
innocent with me.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:14.048
Where is he?

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:18.453
- Billy, I promise you, he
told me that you were dead.

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:22.156
He said you got shot
and you were killed.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:26.761
I swear to God I didn't know.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:34.068
I'm sorry.

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:37.438
Hey, hey, listen.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.906
It's okay, we're here.

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:40.641
We're here now, alright?

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.577
The two of us are here.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:44.178
They shot Parker, he's dead.

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:50.184
- I can't get ahold
of Kayla, Kyle.

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.960
- I can't get in touch
with Duke either.

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:04.765
- We have to give the
money back, right?

01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:06.701
We have to give it back, right?

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:08.870
- Listen to me, I
buried the money.

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:12.440
I buried it down
at mile marker 216.

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:16.744
We can use it if
we can trade it.

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.015
We can get out of here.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.789
I'm gonna get you out of here
and I'm gonna get you home.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.258
I promise you that, okay?

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.061
I promise.

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:39.367
- Brother, we gotta go.

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.608
Billy, you made it back.

01:15:50.113 --> 01:15:51.178
You look great.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.480
- You fucking piece of shit!

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:53.447
You left me!

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:54.382
You left me!

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:56.250
- Enough, get off of him!

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:57.218
Knock it off, both of you!

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.719
- Oh, yeah, you gonna beat me?

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.221
- Stop it!

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.256
We're taking the
money back, Ned.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:03.524
We're taking the money back.

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.059
Me and Billy, we're
getting out of here.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.995
You do what you want, but
we're gettin' out of here.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:08.896
- Mm-mm.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.833
You're just gonna leave me?

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:14.602
- You do what you want, Ned.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.470
- No, I'm doing what I want now.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.606
Now I'm doing what I want!
- Alright.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:20.107
- Here's what's gonna happen.

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.577
We're gonna take the money and
we're gonna get out of here.

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.345
Okay, just us three.

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:25.580
Just one big family.
- I'm taking it back.

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.281
I'm taking Billy.
- Don't move, don't.

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:28.549
Don't move.

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:29.917
- I'm taking Billy.
- Stop moving, man.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.719
Stop moving right now.

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:34.288
- I'm taking Billy
and we're going home.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:38.225
Okay, I'm taking Billy
and we're going home.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:41.128
It's okay, don't do this.
- No, it's not okay.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.463
- I'm taking Billy--
- Get away from

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:43.331
that rifle, Kyle.
- We're going home, that's it.

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:44.599
- Watch your hands.

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:46.834
- I'm taking Billy.
- No!

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:48.636
- No, no, no!

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:08.089
- We're gonna go, now.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:08.990
Hit the door.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.510
- Here to pick up the girl.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.085
- Please, don't hurt me.

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:39.487
Please, don't hurt me!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:42.623
Take it easy, I'm
not gonna hurt you.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:55.836
- Pretty sweet ride, huh?

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:09.984
Listen, what happened with
Kyle was an accident, Billy.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:11.719
Okay?

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.322
- You shot him in
the heart, Ned.

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.167
- They have Kayla, Billy.

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:36.010
Just take me to the money and
I'll take you to her, okay?

01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:39.480
Alright?

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:18.552
- There's a car out back,
I want you to take it.

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:20.488
You're gonna head out
on the old highway.

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:22.623
When you pass the
power lines you're

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.058
gonna make a right
on a dirt road.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.760
You're gonna follow
that dirt road

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.561
all the way till it dead ends.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:28.796
There's a farm house there.

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:30.965
I want you to pull the
car inside and wait.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.867
And you don't stop
for anybody, okay?

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:34.702
You go.

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:48.849
Not a minute to spare.

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:51.352
Okay, let's go get our money.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:52.286
- I'm sorry, Van.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:54.855
I should have said--

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:55.756
No!

01:20:08.538 --> 01:20:09.570
- Where is it, hmm?

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:12.640
- I'm
almost there, okay?

01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:15.142
He told me it was here, alright?

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.320
- Come on, come on.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.455
We're gonna get this money.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:31.559
We're gonna find a
new life, me and you.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.930
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:39.033
Everything's gonna
be okay, Billy.

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.335
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:44.805
You got it?

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:46.540
- Yeah, yeah,
it's right here!

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.108
- Show me.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:49.076
- Yeah.

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:50.311
- Show me!

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.312
Show me now.

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:20.241
- Bye, Ned.

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:32.753
- Win.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.641
I found the brothers.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.415
- When someone I regard
as not friend or family

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:06.453
has seen my face it means one
of us is coming to our end.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:13.627
Where is my money?

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:22.369
- The kid isn't here.

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:23.704
Where's the money?

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:27.641
- It was right there.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:30.344
I think the kid
must have taken it.

01:22:33.716 --> 01:22:35.249
Wait, just hang
on a second, okay?

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.051
He's gonna be back soon.

01:22:37.053 --> 01:22:38.285
Probably just
didn't want to stay

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.887
in here with the
money by himself.

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:45.726
You wanna make
sure I'm not lying?

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:48.162
- I believe you are
telling the truth.

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:50.130
I just don't care anymore.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.093
- I got Kayla.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.362
- What?

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.598
- I got her, she's
somewhere safe.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:27.968
You wanted your brothers?

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.336
I did you one better.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:34.975
- Alright, come on,
let's go, come on.

01:23:34.977 --> 01:23:39.646
- Okay, easy kid.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:40.714
Easy, kid.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.060
- You work for them?

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:56.130
- Does it look like
I work for them?

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:01.118
I work for myself.

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:02.402
- Okay, so what, you just
wanted to help me, then?

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:04.838
- Help each other.

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:11.845
- How do I believe that?

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.182
- Do you have a choice?

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:43.077
In there.

01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:04.131
- Honk the horn.

01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:13.107
Honk it again.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:18.812
Kayla!
