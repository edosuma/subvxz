[tense music]

00:11.098 --> 00:18.148
â™ª

00:27.549 --> 00:29.464
- Allie, please, I'm not
saying you're a bad person.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.901
- Oh, but I'm a racist?
How can you say that?

00:31.944 --> 00:33.076
- Because you're white.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.730
- So you're a racist too?

00:34.773 --> 00:35.731
- Of course.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.124
So is every otherwell-intentioned

00:37.167 --> 00:38.473
"woke" millennial in Brooklyn.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.562
- Okay, I know I'm new and all,
Spencer, but I--

00:40.605 --> 00:42.694
- No, it's not an accusationor an insult.

00:42.738 --> 00:43.913
It's just a fact.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.785
- Okay, so, let's pretend
for the moment

00:46.829 --> 00:49.571
anyway that I agree
with your premise.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.312
Hey, Vicky.
- Hey.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.270
- That all white people
are racist.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.143
Now what?
What's the next step?

00:56.186 --> 01:00.103
What do we, the decent, kind,
unintentional racists,

01:00.147 --> 01:01.626
actually do about it?

01:01.670 --> 01:04.803
- We should discussthis more in depth tonight.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.067
Over dinner.
- Are you asking me on a date?

01:07.110 --> 01:08.285
- Yeah, if that's okay.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.504
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.984
- No, dinner sounds fun.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.986
Still think your theory
is ridiculous.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.858
- [chuckles]
Okay.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.033
- Oh, my God.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.252
[dramatic music]

01:18.295 --> 01:19.688
What the hell's--
oh, my God!

01:19.731 --> 01:20.863
- Run!

01:20.906 --> 01:23.822
[overlapping screams]

01:27.478 --> 01:30.438
- [whimpering]

01:30.481 --> 01:34.181
[tense music]

01:34.572 --> 01:36.008
- Well, we're glad
you're here, Tiffany.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.532
- I'm glad to be here.

01:37.575 --> 01:38.837
White Collar was fun and all,

01:38.881 --> 01:41.101
but I didn't join the FBIto arrest accountants.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.537
- [chuckling]
Right.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.713
- By the way, what kind of nameis "Jubal"?

01:44.756 --> 01:47.455
- "Jubal," it is--
well, it's, I guess a tribute

01:47.498 --> 01:50.458
to my grandfather, theHonorable Jubal N. Valentine.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.156
- Oh, it's like that.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.462
- [chuckles]
Yeah, I guess.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.551
Ah, so here, Stuart Scola.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.335
This is your new partner,Tiffany Wallace.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.858
- Oh.Nice to meet you.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.338
I thought you were startingnext week.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.992
- I got settled in a little
earlier than I thought.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.560
- Great, well, looking forward
to working with you.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.083
- Yeah, Tiffany spenttwo years in Atlanta

02:07.127 --> 02:09.781
working white-collar, but she
grew up here in Brooklyn.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.914
- Bed Stuy.
Thrilled to be back.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.090
- Oh, Tiffany, this is--
- Hey, I'm Omar.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.310
These guys call me "OA."

02:16.353 --> 02:18.399
- Okay, listen up.
I just got a call.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.096
There's been a mass shooting
in Greenpoint.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.489
I want all hands on deck.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.665
- Just like that.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.928
[soft dramatic music]

02:25.971 --> 02:31.977
â™ª

02:32.021 --> 02:34.154
- Maggie Bell.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.198
- [chuckles]
Hey.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.766
- You're back?
- Yeah, I am.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.421
We bump elbows or something?What are we doing?

02:40.464 --> 02:43.119
- No, I think we can hug.
- Right.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.947
- [chuckling]

02:44.990 --> 02:47.210
[soft music]

02:47.254 --> 02:49.386
Come on!

02:50.822 --> 02:52.650
- So how did the undercover
gig go?

02:52.694 --> 02:54.348
- Fine.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.133
- Did you close the case?
- I made 16 arrests.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.439
- Sounds like a home run.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.268
- Look, I'm just happy
to be back here with you.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.965
Playing "Maggie Bell" again.

03:03.008 --> 03:06.621
I mean, it's not as glamorous
pretending to be somebody 24/7.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.100
- But everything went well?

03:08.144 --> 03:10.407
- Got the job done.
- What does that mean?

03:10.451 --> 03:12.540
- It means that I'm ready
to move forward

03:12.583 --> 03:14.324
and start a new chapter.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.328
- Still need to be in control.
Copy that.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.510
- So, how'd you like
"Hotlanta"?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.470
- It was okay.

03:29.513 --> 03:33.952
A little too Southern for me,but I had fun.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.391
And just so you know, nobodycalls it "Hotlanta" anymore.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.044
- Oh.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.524
Got it.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.483
It's the first time
I ever said it, too.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.661
So why'd you leave NYPD?

03:46.704 --> 03:49.098
- Man, I feel like I'm
on a bad first date!

03:49.141 --> 03:51.753
- Oh.
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.322
Didn't mean to...

03:55.365 --> 03:57.411
I thought "Hotlanta" would be
the most awkward moment

03:57.454 --> 03:58.586
of the morning.

03:58.629 --> 04:01.502
- Sorry, I'm just...

04:01.545 --> 04:04.809
sometimes I'm justa little bit too blunt.

04:04.853 --> 04:09.292
I left the NYPD
because I needed a change.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.339
I got tired of talkingabout the Yankees,

04:12.382 --> 04:15.298
the blue wall and hanging outat dive bars

04:15.342 --> 04:17.648
called O'Sullivan'sand Murphy's.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.913
- For the record,

04:21.957 --> 04:24.916
I'm half Irish.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.664
- Get a uniform to escort you.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.579
- Right over here.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.843
[indistinct chatter]

04:41.759 --> 04:43.761
- Maggie Bell.
- Tiffany Wallace.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.720
- Good to meet you.
- So what do we know?

04:45.763 --> 04:47.548
- We've got four dead,
all in their 20s.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.419
We've got two men, both white.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.334
Two women.
One white, one Asian.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.379
- Any witnesses?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.337
- A few, but theydidn't see much.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.338
The shooters
were wearing masks.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.731
- We recover the casings?

04:56.774 --> 04:58.385
- Yeah, we know the shooters
were using Krinkovs.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.603
- Have you found
the shooters yet?

04:59.647 --> 05:00.996
- Excuse me, sir,
can you back up?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.302
- This is my company.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.912
Those four people in body bagsare my employees.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.261
I have a right to knowwhat's going on.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.742
- You're absolutely right.
Let's take a walk.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.266
We'll find a quiet place
we can talk.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.007
â™ª

05:12.050 --> 05:13.748
- All right, come on in!
Just talked to Maggie.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.010
Here's what we know so far.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.273
We got two shooters,
both firing Krinkovs.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.668
Four victims, all journalists
at Echt Media.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.148
- Known for its progressive
political commentary

05:23.192 --> 05:25.107
and disruptive social ideas.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.717
- Right.
They're liberal--most likely

05:26.761 --> 05:28.589
extremely liberal, which means
we need to start digging

05:28.632 --> 05:30.025
into right-wing hate groups.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.332
Pull security cam footage
within a two-block radius.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.812
Get to work, let's talk
to each other, people!

05:34.856 --> 05:35.813
- Hey.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.119
So Maggie and OAare on the scene.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.860
Scola and Tiffanyare canvassing for witnesses,

05:38.903 --> 05:41.297
but so far no actionable leads.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.603
But dock is hot, so...

05:42.646 --> 05:45.170
- Great, thanks.
- Yeah.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.955
Oh, hey, uh...

05:48.609 --> 05:50.915
Got a text from Kristen.She's moving to Dallas, huh?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.003
- Yeah.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.354
Yeah, she wanted
a change of scenery.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.007
It's her decision.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.879
- Right.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.621
Okay, well... as long
as she's happy, I guess.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.275
- She is.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.018
- I wasn't awareof any specific threats,

06:07.062 --> 06:09.412
but we do get hundreds ofnon-specific threats every day.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.761
- Well, what do you mean
by that?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.633
- Well, there's so much hatein the air.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.069
No matter what you say,the other side is constantly

06:14.112 --> 06:16.158
on the attack,
and it's personal.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.639
You know, it used to be all
this political and social

06:18.682 --> 06:20.336
vitriol was just rhetoric.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.730
Now it's like we are actually
on the verge of a civil war.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.253
- Well, have you posted
anything controversial

06:24.296 --> 06:25.646
the past few days?

06:25.689 --> 06:27.822
Anything that would agitate
a certain political

06:27.865 --> 06:29.693
or ethnic group?
- It's our goal to publish

06:29.737 --> 06:31.391
something controversial
every day.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.914
It's our business model.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.177
I'm happy to answerany other questions you have,

06:35.220 --> 06:36.526
but I should go.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.832
I need to talk
to the employees.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.487
- Okay, sir, that's not how--
- Hey.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.488
Just got a textfrom my informant.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.706
He may have a lead.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.974
- You guys out here
when the shooting went down?

06:50.018 --> 06:51.411
[whistles]
Excuse me.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.891
I asked you a question.
- Yeah, I ain't answering.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.198
- Did you hear
any gunshots, sir?

06:56.241 --> 06:58.896
- Man, you deaf?
I just said I ain't talking!

06:58.940 --> 07:01.551
- You ain't talking, why?
'Cause you're a tough guy?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.118
- 'Cause you're the police.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.294
- No, we're the FBI.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.687
So let me ask you again.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.862
Were you out here
when the shooting went down?

07:07.905 --> 07:10.299
Yes or no?
- No.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.040
- Aw, look at you.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.824
Trying to be all hard
and make a statement.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.783
- You don't know a damn
thing about me, lady.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.307
- One, don't call me "lady."

07:18.350 --> 07:20.918
Two, I know a lot about you.

07:20.962 --> 07:24.226
Like that tattoo on your arm?
"BMW"?

07:24.269 --> 07:26.446
Means you roll
with Brooklyn's Most Wanted,

07:26.489 --> 07:28.317
which means you're connected
to the Trey-Nine Crips,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.798
which means you probably
grew up in Brownsville.

07:30.841 --> 07:34.192
I'm guessing the Tilden Street
Housing Projects.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.933
â™ª

07:35.977 --> 07:39.415
Another thing you should know,
Jalen,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.244
is that lying to me ain't like
lying to some fat dude

07:42.287 --> 07:44.289
in a blue uniform.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.900
It's a felony.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.293
You do time behind that crap.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.862
So the second
I walk away from here,

07:51.906 --> 07:53.255
I'ma pull every piece
of surveillance footage

07:53.298 --> 07:54.691
I can find.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.477
And if I see your sorry butt
out here at 8:27 a.m.,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.130
I'ma charge you with perjury.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.785
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.570
Look, I was here.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.224
I--I heard the gunshots.
- Then what?

08:06.268 --> 08:10.098
- I saw two dudes wearing masks
jump into a blue car.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.317
- What kind of car?
- I'm not sure.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.799
A sedan?
Kia, maybe?

08:17.148 --> 08:20.151
- It was nice doing business
with you, Jalen.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.154
[dramatic music]

08:23.198 --> 08:26.854
â™ª

08:26.897 --> 08:28.420
- Nice work back there.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.118
But you didn't need
to jump in like that.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.512
I had everything under control.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.209
- Oh, my bad.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.037
I just reacted.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.780
I knew who that dude was, what
buttons to press, so I did it.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.259
But I'm sorry
if I offended you.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.478
- No big deal.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.959
Just thought I'd, you know...say something.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.613
- I'm glad you did.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.745
But for the record, Scola...

08:48.789 --> 08:50.747
if you got a problem
with people speaking up,

08:50.791 --> 08:52.575
if you got a lot of rules
about when and how

08:52.619 --> 08:55.926
I'm supposed to talk to people,
you should let me know.

08:55.970 --> 08:59.843
Now.
'Cause I don't roll like that.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.758
- Well, neither do I.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.369
So you got nothing
to worry about.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.157
And I'd preferif you call me "Stuart."

09:10.506 --> 09:12.987
- I'll let Jubal know
about the blue Kia.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.774
- Hey.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.384
- I'm sorry to bother you, man.

09:19.428 --> 09:23.911
But I'm just--
I'm sorta freaking.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.913
I was working last nightat that biker bar.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.305
I was talking to these twodudes I know.

09:27.349 --> 09:30.308
I've been working real hardthe past few weeks!

09:30.352 --> 09:33.660
Anyway, they start talkingabout doing some crazy stuff.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.009
Okay?Um...

09:35.052 --> 09:36.271
"Making noise."They kept saying that.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.316
"We're gonna makesome noise, bro."

09:38.360 --> 09:39.796
I tried to find out what theywere talking about, but--

09:39.840 --> 09:41.842
- You know these guys' names?

09:41.885 --> 09:43.278
- Tyler and Eddie.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.714
I don't know their last names.Didn't ask.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.673
You told me, "Never askfor last names.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.371
They'll think you're a cop."

09:49.414 --> 09:51.199
[coughing]

09:51.242 --> 09:52.809
I think it's possible thoseguys might have been involved

09:52.853 --> 09:54.245
in that shooting this morning.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.856
- What do you mean, "involved"?

09:55.899 --> 09:58.641
- The guy who drove the car...

09:58.685 --> 10:00.904
he was at the bar this morning.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.734
- What the hell
are you talking about?

10:04.778 --> 10:06.344
- He came by the bar
an hour ago.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.955
He was real nervous.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.783
He said he was driving a stolen
car with these two idiots,

10:09.826 --> 10:11.132
Tyler and Eddie,

10:11.175 --> 10:12.916
and then they jumped out
and started shooting.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.222
- Who's this guy?

10:14.265 --> 10:17.268
- He goes by Big Mike.
That's all I know.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.879
- Big Mike, okay.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.576
So I'm a little confused.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.708
Bike Mike, he just came in

10:21.751 --> 10:23.318
and volunteered
this info to you?

10:23.361 --> 10:26.538
- I'm just telling youwhat happened, Omar.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.801
But Big Mike's a good dude;

10:27.844 --> 10:30.325
he didn't know they were
gonna start shooting.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.851
- He didn't know?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.592
Those guys
were carrying Krinkovs.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.985
- He was scared.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.377
- I would be, too,
but it doesn't matter

10:39.421 --> 10:41.466
that he was scared.
He was involved.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.555
So you need to go
find this guy now.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.427
- Okay, I'll try, but--

10:45.470 --> 10:47.951
he said he was going to Floridaor maybe Georgia?

10:47.995 --> 10:50.432
â™ª

10:50.475 --> 10:51.825
[screams]

10:51.868 --> 10:53.609
Ugh!
- If you're really this upset,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.394
why don't you go track down Big
Mike and get me a last name?

10:56.438 --> 10:59.746
â™ª

10:59.789 --> 11:02.270
- You got it, Omar.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.925
â™ª

11:04.968 --> 11:06.883
- Okay.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.146
â™ª

11:09.190 --> 11:12.106
By the way,
talked to my buddy in D.C.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.282
He might be able
to find you a job.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.066
A real one.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.460
- Appreciate you
looking out.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.288
â™ª

11:20.331 --> 11:23.030
- Okay, Zayne.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.946
- Where are we on the names?
Tyler? Eddie? Big Mike?

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
Ring any bells with you guys?Narcotics, prison gangs?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.297
- Still running screens,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.951
but there are lots
of Eddies and Tylers out there.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.169
Only a few "Big Mikes."

11:32.213 --> 11:33.780
but nine match
the physical description.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.129
- All right.What about the shooters' car,

11:35.172 --> 11:36.783
the blue Kia?We have any video yet?

11:36.826 --> 11:38.741
- Just pulled some footage
from a camera two blocks away.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.656
- Okay, throw it up.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.397
â™ª

11:42.440 --> 11:44.704
Hey.
- Yeah, running the plate now.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.097
â™ª

11:47.141 --> 11:50.622
Okay, car is registered
to Nancy Moore, 53.

11:50.666 --> 11:55.453
Address is 234 87th Street
in Williamsburg.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.152
Car was reported stolen
at 7:47 this morning.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.283
- There you go.
Reach out to Nancy,

11:59.327 --> 12:00.415
find out where the car
was stolen,

12:00.458 --> 12:01.808
pull any security footage
in the area,

12:01.851 --> 12:02.809
you know the drill.
- Yeah, on it.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.724
- All right, roll it.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.944
[tense music]

12:07.988 --> 12:09.685
- The crime scene is two
blocks east of this.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.688
- Yeah, can you push in
on the driver's face?

12:12.732 --> 12:19.869
â™ª

12:38.845 --> 12:39.759
- The driver
is your informant?

12:39.802 --> 12:40.934
- Yes, I just met with him.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.326
He thought he might know
who was involved.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.719
- But he never mentioned
that he was at the scene.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.721
Or the fact that he
was driving the getaway car.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.853
- [sighs]
Correct.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.289
- All right,so what was he doing?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.857
He was playing.
Fishing for information, right?

12:50.900 --> 12:53.120
- No, maybe fishing
for absolution?

12:53.163 --> 12:54.382
- How do you mean?

12:54.425 --> 12:56.036
- He was nervous,
talking in circles.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.212
He made up a story
about a guy named "Big Mike"

12:58.255 --> 13:00.040
that was stealing a car
and driving around

13:00.083 --> 13:01.389
with two other guys.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.043
He didn't know
they were gonna start shooting.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.001
He was probably just trying to
get close to the two shooters,

13:05.045 --> 13:06.046
prove that he wasn't a cop.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.047
- It doesn't matter.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.527
Just get him in here.
Now.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.051
- All right.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.101
- Zayne, it's me, Omar.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.624
Again, listen, man.
You gotta give me a call back.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.757
I just got a call
from my buddy in D.C.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.020
He said that there may be
an opening here in New York

13:24.064 --> 13:25.674
for a surveillance specialist.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.241
He wants to know if he
can meet with you today,

13:27.284 --> 13:28.895
so just get back to me,
let me know.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.505
All right.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.723
His phone's off.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.508
The calls keep going
straight to voicemail.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.337
- Well, of course his
phone's off; he's on the run.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.644
- Yeah, maybe.
But he's not a killer, Maggie.

13:41.516 --> 13:45.215
I know what it looks like,
but he's a decent human being.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.261
I mean, I met himat an anti-Muslim rally,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.045
but he was just theremarching with a bunch of Arabs.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.655
He wants to help.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.614
He doesn't even care about,
getting paid, like, for real.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.572
There is no way that he
would willingly participate

13:54.616 --> 13:57.140
in a mass shooting.
- Okay.

13:59.229 --> 14:02.363
- Maggie.
- Hey.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.800
I thought you were
taking the week off.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.628
- I thought you were too.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.282
- This is Omar Zidan.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.414
This is Nestor, who I workedthe undercover case with.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.852
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.375
Congratulations, I heard you
guys had some good results.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.290
- We did well.
I had a lot of fun, too.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.900
- I don't know if "fun"is the word I would use.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.336
- She tends
to overthink things.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.903
- Do I?

14:20.947 --> 14:23.601
- Good to meet you, Omar.
Talk soon.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.169
[elevator dings]

14:27.388 --> 14:30.260
- Is he a good guy?
- He's a good agent.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.741
Lead hostage negotiator.Runs Gang Unit.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.744
- I asked if he was a good guy.
- He's all right.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.702
A little too cocky for me.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.618
- Zayne, it's me, Omar.
Open up!

14:42.316 --> 14:43.404
Zayne!
Anybody home?

14:43.447 --> 14:44.971
- Okay, we needto get a warrant.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.798
- No, we don't

14:46.842 --> 14:50.324
because there is
a spare key.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.761
Right here, see?
Told you he was a good kid.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.371
He trusts me.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
Zayne, you home?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
[suspenseful music]

15:01.988 --> 15:03.990
- Clear.

15:04.033 --> 15:10.648
â™ª

15:14.914 --> 15:15.958
- OA?

15:16.002 --> 15:18.700
â™ª

15:18.743 --> 15:20.571
- Oh, my God.

15:20.615 --> 15:27.578
â™ª

15:29.276 --> 15:31.974
- Either Zayne's a really
diligent informant,

15:32.018 --> 15:33.715
or he's involved.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.239
[telephone dialing]

15:36.283 --> 15:37.893
Hey, Jubal?
I just sent you some photos.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.417
Can you put them through
facial rec right away?

15:40.461 --> 15:43.551
- I got two names:
Tyler Haddock and Eddie White.

15:43.594 --> 15:44.813
- Somebody tell me about 'em.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.206
- Haddock has three priors

15:46.249 --> 15:47.642
originating from Plainfield,
New Jersey.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.687
And the other guy, White,
has five priors

15:49.731 --> 15:50.993
born and raised
in Staten Island.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.038
- Gang affiliations?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.300
- Looks like they're affiliated

15:53.343 --> 15:54.518
with a group called
"Freedom Fighters."

15:54.562 --> 15:55.824
- Okay, let's get
an address for these two.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.086
Kelly, can you run
the surveillance video

15:57.130 --> 15:58.783
from the warehouse back again?

15:58.827 --> 16:00.263
Let's confirm
that Tyler and Haddock

16:00.307 --> 16:03.092
are the two guys
leaving the scene.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.442
- Okay, Haddock is 6'2",
White is 5'9".

16:05.486 --> 16:08.228
Ford Fusion is...
- Is 57.7 inches.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.795
That's four feet 10 inches?

16:10.839 --> 16:13.276
- Okay, so, using the car
as a reference point,

16:13.320 --> 16:15.713
that means the scale
is 11.9 inches.

16:15.757 --> 16:19.587
Which means, Man 1,
White, is about 5'9".

16:19.630 --> 16:23.591
And Man 2,
Haddock, is about 6'1".

16:23.634 --> 16:25.506
- All right, that's close
enough, but we need more.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.248
Can we zoom in?
See if we can find something.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.119
[sighs]
What do we got?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.339
What is that?
I think we got a tattoo.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.080
Yeah, let's see
if he's got this tattoo.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.125
"488."
Does that mean anything?

16:36.169 --> 16:37.953
- No, but "1488" does.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.955
Maybe there's a "1" under
the sleeve we can't see?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.913
- Okay, let's assume there is.
What's it mean?

16:41.957 --> 16:45.482
- The "14" stands for a 14-word
white supremacy slogan.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.441
"We must secure
the existence of our people

16:47.484 --> 16:49.443
and a future
for white children."

16:49.486 --> 16:51.097
The "88" is code
for "Heil Hitler."

16:51.140 --> 16:54.143
Eight equals "H," eighth letter
of the alphabet, so...

16:54.187 --> 16:56.363
- Yeah, it's a match.
"1488."

16:56.406 --> 16:57.625
It's among the listed tattoos

16:57.668 --> 16:59.148
documented in Haddock's
last arrest.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.193
- Get SWAT over there
right away.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.978
I'll call Maggie and OA.
Good work.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.981
[men whispering]

17:06.025 --> 17:08.984
[suspenseful music]

17:09.028 --> 17:11.073
- On you. Ready?

17:11.117 --> 17:13.206
[grunts] FBI!

17:15.860 --> 17:17.645
- High-tech, 12:00!

17:18.689 --> 17:19.908
- [shouts]

17:19.951 --> 17:21.605
- Come on, Scotty!

17:21.649 --> 17:23.303
- Let's go!

17:23.346 --> 17:24.826
- Zayne's going out the back!

17:24.869 --> 17:26.567
- [indistinct]
We got two on the run!

17:26.610 --> 17:28.221
- Zayne!
- Don't move!

17:28.264 --> 17:31.572
â™ª

17:31.615 --> 17:34.879
- FBI!
Stop, stop!

17:34.923 --> 17:36.142
Stop!

17:36.185 --> 17:41.495
â™ª

17:41.538 --> 17:44.324
- OA, over there.
- Go, go, go!

17:44.367 --> 17:45.803
I got him!

17:47.196 --> 17:48.763
Scola, he's gone.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.852
â™ª

17:50.895 --> 17:52.114
- Zayne!

17:52.158 --> 17:53.637
Zayne, ugh!

17:57.641 --> 18:00.427
Zayne!
What are you doing?

18:00.470 --> 18:03.299
â™ª

18:03.343 --> 18:05.736
Who the hell are you?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.782
- Connor Lang.

18:07.825 --> 18:14.571
â™ª

18:15.006 --> 18:17.835
- I told you, I had nothing
to do with that shooting.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.533
- So why were youwith the two idiots who did?

18:19.576 --> 18:21.100
- I stopped over
to have a beer.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.623
- Why, to celebrate?

18:22.666 --> 18:23.885
- It says here
that you're an associate

18:23.928 --> 18:25.626
of the "Freedom Fighters,"
is that true?

18:25.669 --> 18:28.150
- Yeah, but that don't mean
I shoot people.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.413
I was at home in bed
when that shooting happened.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.111
I didn't leave my apartment
till noon.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.548
I drove over to Gino's Pizza.
Go check for yourself.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.027
There's a lot of cameras
in my building.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.420
- Okay, we will.So...

18:37.464 --> 18:39.335
You want us to believethat you just so happened

18:39.379 --> 18:40.597
to go over to those guys' house

18:40.641 --> 18:42.425
the same day they killedfour innocent people?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.166
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I do.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.734
- I stopped over to see if
Eddie could fix my oil pump.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.518
He's real good with engines.
- I feel like you

18:48.562 --> 18:50.564
can do better than that, man.
- It's the truth!

18:50.607 --> 18:52.174
- Look, I had no idea they went
over to Echt's

18:52.218 --> 18:54.568
and started shooting people.
None.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.137
Did what they had to do,
I guess.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.573
- Sir, what did you just say?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.272
"They did what they had to do"?

19:05.318 --> 19:07.102
They killed fourinnocent people.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.409
- If you work at Echt Media,
you ain't innocent.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.888
They're the cause
for all this nonsense.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.239
All they do is celebrate
the gays and the Blacks.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.718
Talking about
how great they are

19:14.762 --> 19:17.068
and how evil and stupid we are.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.464
- You know who this guy is?
- Yeah, it's Zayne.

19:21.508 --> 19:22.857
- He in your little club too?

19:22.900 --> 19:23.988
"Freedom Fighters"?

19:24.032 --> 19:27.253
- Yeah, I don't know.
I never asked.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.558
But that dude's crazy.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.125
Works over at this biker bar.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.694
He's always talking trash
about Blacks, Puerto Ricans...

19:33.737 --> 19:35.696
Arabs.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.786
- Is that it?
- Mm.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.533
So, what, can I go now?

19:48.012 --> 19:51.015
[scoffs]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.933
- OA?

19:55.977 --> 19:58.327
- He still won't return
my calls or my texts.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.937
- He's not going to respond.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.636
Why are you asking
so surprised?

20:02.679 --> 20:05.029
- Because I've known this kid
for two years.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.683
He's a great informant.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.598
And yeah, he's a little crazy
and he takes risks

20:08.642 --> 20:10.209
but he gets results
and until this morning,

20:10.252 --> 20:13.429
he has never lied to me.
Ever.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.083
So forgive me
for being surprised

20:15.126 --> 20:16.650
that he keeps blowing me off.

20:16.693 --> 20:21.350
- Look, OA, I knowthat this has been hard, but...

20:21.394 --> 20:22.830
obviously Zaynehas been hanging out

20:22.873 --> 20:24.658
with these white supremacists,listening to their gripes,

20:24.701 --> 20:26.616
their speeches.
- Yeah, so?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.052
- Yeah, well,maybe their way of thinking

20:28.096 --> 20:29.663
is starting to rub off.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.927
Look, it is not easy lyingall day every day

20:32.970 --> 20:35.277
pretending to be somebodythat you're not.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.018
- I don't know who you think
you're talking to, Maggie.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.803
I've been undercover.
Zayne did not flip.

20:39.847 --> 20:40.978
No way.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.938
- Okay, let me try thisanother way then.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.420
I think you needto sit this one out.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.943
- What the hell
are you talking about?

20:48.986 --> 20:51.467
- You're too investedin Zayne's innocence.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.729
It's blocking your judgement.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.776
- Mm, no.
I'm good.

20:56.733 --> 20:57.995
- Hey.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.519
Did you guys getany useful information

20:59.562 --> 21:00.694
about this Connor guy?

21:00.737 --> 21:03.000
- Yeah.
We know he's a lunatic racist

21:03.044 --> 21:05.525
who needs a new oil pump.
That's about it.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.048
- And your informant?
Did you locate him?

21:07.091 --> 21:08.876
- No.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.878
- Wrong answer.
I just talked to DHS.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.575
There's a lot of chatter
about a second attack

21:12.619 --> 21:15.404
and it is coming
from the Freedom Fighters.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.581
We need to find
your informant fast.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.584
[dramatic music]

21:21.628 --> 21:25.196
â™ª

21:30.637 --> 21:31.942
- Mr. Wells, we're looking
for your son, Zayne.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.248
It's important.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.902
- What's going on?
Did he do something wrong?

21:34.945 --> 21:36.860
- We think he may have
inadvertently gotten himself

21:36.904 --> 21:39.863
mixed up with some
dangerous people.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.170
- Well, Zayne was here
about an hour ago.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.389
He was all over the place.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.564
Pacing, talkinga mile a minute.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.826
He wanted money.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.958
Said he needed to move,buy a new phone.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.090
- A new phone?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.352
Has he called you
from that phone yet?

21:50.396 --> 21:51.614
Yeah, like five minutes ago.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.877
- Okay, could you give him
a call back?

21:53.921 --> 21:55.792
Actually, could you
video chat him?

21:58.534 --> 22:00.275
I just need you to say hello.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.146
[phone ringing]

22:02.190 --> 22:03.757
- Zayne?
- Hey, Dad.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.672
- Hey, Zayne.
- Omar?

22:05.715 --> 22:07.238
- What is going on?
- Hey, man.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.675
- We know that you
were driving the car.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.067
- I had no idea
those two dudes

22:10.111 --> 22:11.242
were gonna
start shooting, man.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.157
I swear to God!
- Okay, I believe you,

22:13.201 --> 22:14.985
but you need to tell me
what is happening.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.337
- I stole the car to try to
get in tight with those guys.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.599
You know, I was trying
to sell my cover.

22:19.642 --> 22:20.948
They were getting suspicious!

22:20.991 --> 22:23.385
So I did what you told me
to do, you know?

22:23.429 --> 22:25.692
Prove them wrong.
Act like a criminal, so I did.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.433
And then...

22:27.476 --> 22:30.349
and then they had me drive
to that warehouse in Brooklyn.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.482
- Okay, I get it.
You were just doing your job.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.528
But, look, stuff like this
is gonna happen.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.443
- Are you gonna arrest me?

22:37.486 --> 22:38.966
- Zayne, I didn't say that.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.229
- A few hours ago, you said
the driver was involved.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.970
And that he might as well
have pulled the trigger!

22:43.013 --> 22:44.624
- Zayne, I am going
to help you,

22:44.667 --> 22:47.061
but we need to meet up now.

22:47.104 --> 22:51.239
- Meet me at the corner of,
uh... of Noble and West.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.067
I'll be there in, like,
10 minutes, okay?

22:53.110 --> 22:54.024
- Okay.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.678
Thank you so much.
- Look!

22:55.722 --> 22:57.288
I don't know what the hell
he got himself into,

22:57.332 --> 22:58.725
but he's a good kid.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.596
He was so excited when he knew

23:00.640 --> 23:03.033
you were trying to get him
a legitimate job.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.341
Please?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.561
Don't hurt my son.

23:08.604 --> 23:11.564
[somber music]

23:11.607 --> 23:15.524
â™ª

23:15.568 --> 23:17.308
- Oh, I got him.

23:17.352 --> 23:20.094
He's two blocks east of here
heading east on Milton.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.141
Zayne!

23:24.185 --> 23:27.144

- [screams]

23:39.418 --> 23:46.425
â™ª

23:46.468 --> 23:47.948
- FBI, do not move!

23:47.991 --> 23:49.732
- Why are you running, Zayne?
Huh?

23:49.776 --> 23:52.387
- Hey, hey, let her go!
- Hey!

23:52.431 --> 23:53.910
- Nobody come inside.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.912
- Don't do this, Zayne!
Do not do this!

23:55.956 --> 23:58.480
- I'll shoot everyone in here!
I swear to God!

23:58.524 --> 24:02.397
â™ª

24:02.441 --> 24:03.833
- What do we got?

24:03.877 --> 24:06.401
- Seven hostages in total.
All appear to be adults.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.663
Four women, three men.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.535
- Is Vertiz on site yet?

24:09.578 --> 24:10.971
- Yeah, he just landed.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.539
I'll call Maggie and OA,
tell them he's in charge.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.844
- Set up across the street.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.412
Give me a clear shot, Kyle.
Now, go!

24:17.456 --> 24:18.935
Open a line of communication.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.807
See if we can hijack
the video feed.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.722
- Agent Vertiz,I know the hostage taker.

24:22.765 --> 24:23.897
He's my informant.
- Okay.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.159
Anything I need to know?

24:25.202 --> 24:26.552
- Despite what just happened,
yeah.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.423
He's just scared, okay?

24:28.467 --> 24:29.424
He got caught upin the shooting

24:29.468 --> 24:30.599
this morning by accident.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.992
- Okay, but that
doesn't really matter.

24:32.035 --> 24:35.082
Not now--he's taken seven
innocent people hostage.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.649
- I am aware of what it lookslike, but--

24:36.692 --> 24:38.738
- I'll take it from here.

24:38.781 --> 24:39.869
- Okay, but let me help.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.871
- I said I'll take it
from here.

24:43.612 --> 24:44.744
Good, good.
You're good--okay.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.310
Open an angle
[indistinct].

24:46.354 --> 24:47.834
We'll start on the left side,
and we'll move to the right.

[dramatic music]

24:50.880 --> 24:54.231
â™ª

24:54.275 --> 24:56.059
- Find anything interesting?
- Not yet.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.626
Tyler and Eddiehad lots of devices,

24:57.670 --> 24:59.062
so we still havelots of scrolling to do.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.587
- Hey, I got something.
- Tell me.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.154
- Incoming textto Tyler Haddock.

25:04.198 --> 25:09.116
"Nice work on Echt.More fun coming soon."

25:11.814 --> 25:13.381
- Run the phone.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.559
- Can't locate it.
Must be a burner.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
- OA.

25:19.605 --> 25:23.739
The chatter is real.
A second attack is imminent.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.177
- Please confirm,
do you have eyes on the target?

25:27.221 --> 25:28.962
- Yes, sir, I have a clear shot
through the window

25:29.005 --> 25:30.790
on the southwest corner.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.792
- Okay, on my command.

25:34.663 --> 25:35.664
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

25:35.708 --> 25:36.796
- What the hell are you doing?

25:36.839 --> 25:37.927
We have intel
on a second attack.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.059
- So?
- So Zayne is our best lead.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.843
He might be able to help.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.630
- Sir, I still have
a clean shot.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.241
Please confirm, green light.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.764
- Nestor, just let me
talk to him.

25:48.808 --> 25:51.201
See what he knows, please.
- Sir, do I have the green?

25:51.245 --> 25:52.725
- Stand down.Repeat, stand down.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.204
- Thank you.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.824
[phone ringing]

26:04.867 --> 26:06.695
- Zayne?
It's me, Omar.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.829
Listen, I am gonna help you
and everything is gonna be okay

26:09.872 --> 26:11.526
but you need to let
those people go now.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.703
- You think I'm stupid?
Four people are dead.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.053
- Okay, listen to me, Zayne.
Let me rephrase myself.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.315
I am only here to help you,

26:18.359 --> 26:19.708
but the longer
you stay in there,

26:19.752 --> 26:21.014
the worse this is gonna get,
so you need to come

26:21.057 --> 26:22.537
to your senses now.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.365
- I gotta get
out of the country.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.628
Go someplace safe where
there's no extradition.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.587
- Okay, okay.
We can do that.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.153
We can look into someplace
with no extradition,

26:30.197 --> 26:33.026
but you are gonna need to give
us something in exchange.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.636
- Like what?
- Like the hostages.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.769
- I already said no to that!

26:36.812 --> 26:38.597
- Fine.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.555
Then tell us what you know
about the second attack.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.165
- Second attack?
Man.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.602
How many times
do I have to tell you?

26:43.645 --> 26:45.995
I didn't know anything
about the first attack!

26:46.039 --> 26:48.128
- Did Tyler and Eddie
mention any other names?

26:48.171 --> 26:49.869
Did they mention anything
about a second attack?

26:49.912 --> 26:52.088
Did you meet any other
Freedom Fighters?

26:54.003 --> 26:56.397
- I met a guy named William
at the bar, like...

26:56.440 --> 26:58.399
three or four days ago.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.445
- Okay, that's good.
Did you get a last name?

27:01.489 --> 27:02.708
What's he look like?

27:02.751 --> 27:06.233
- About--he's, like, mid-30s?
Had a beard.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.452
The number 13 was tattooed
on his arm.

27:08.496 --> 27:12.239
Tyler and Eddie, they were
in awe of this guy, okay?

27:12.282 --> 27:16.591
They said he was...
a "true believer."

27:16.635 --> 27:17.984
- Okay, okay, amazing.

27:18.027 --> 27:21.727
You're helping us.
Now we can help you.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.554
- All right, listen up--I need
the full name and address

27:23.598 --> 27:24.773
of a man named William.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.557
Male, white,
approximately 30 years old.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.385
Has the number 13 tattooed
on his arm,

27:28.429 --> 27:30.170
so he's either
a huge James Harden fan

27:30.213 --> 27:32.085
or a member
of the Aryan Circle.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.695
My money's on the latter,
so let's find this guy,

27:33.739 --> 27:35.088
shall we?
- I have seven Williams

27:35.131 --> 27:36.742
with ties
to white nationalist groups.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.658
Four are under the age of 40
and only one lives in New York.

27:39.701 --> 27:40.920
William Ellis, long rap sheet.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.922
- William Ellis, check him out.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.227
- Yep, looks like
he's a suspect

27:44.271 --> 27:46.708
in a recent arson case as well.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.189
- That's enough for now.
Find me the last known address.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
- [grunts]

27:51.060 --> 27:53.193
Federal agents.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.022
- Clear immediate.

27:56.065 --> 27:59.025
[ominous music]

27:59.068 --> 28:03.769
â™ª

28:03.812 --> 28:05.292
- Front's clear!

28:05.335 --> 28:07.860
- Clear.
- Check the basement!

28:07.903 --> 28:12.778
â™ª

28:12.821 --> 28:15.955
[agent shouts indistinctly]

28:20.002 --> 28:21.308
- Jubal, it's me.

28:21.351 --> 28:25.791
Looks like Ellis is on the move
with a bomb.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.488
- That's Ellis's car,
right there.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.665
The black SUV, heading east on
123rd Street and Brooklyn.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.972
- All right, all right.
Put out a BOLO right away

28:33.015 --> 28:34.321
and let's get up on his phone

28:34.364 --> 28:36.279
and into that vehicle's
LoJack system.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.759
We need to find out
where he's going

28:37.803 --> 28:39.500
and get there before he does.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.545
Let's go, let's go!

28:45.071 --> 28:47.638
- Hey!
You did really good, Zayne.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.336
Okay, remembering the name
William was huge.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.730
Everyone at the FBI
is very grateful.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.993
But more importantly, they
believe you now, all right?

28:54.036 --> 28:56.125
They know that you were just
trying to be a good informant.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.518
But you're gonna need
to keep helping us,

28:57.561 --> 28:59.085
so I need you
to let those hostages go

28:59.128 --> 29:00.477
before anyone gets hurt.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.262
And if you do that,
I can get you a good deal.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.698
- Don't play me, Omar!

29:03.742 --> 29:07.006
I want a--a car.
No, an SUV!

29:07.049 --> 29:08.268
And I want a jet.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.965
- No, no.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.967
That is a bad idea, Zayne.
Okay? Enough.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.186
- I don't care!

29:13.229 --> 29:15.536
Do it, or I'll shoot
everyone in here.

29:15.579 --> 29:18.582
I swear to God!
- Zayne, Zayne, don't--

29:18.626 --> 29:20.802
[suspenseful music]

29:20.846 --> 29:23.152
- Jubal?
We're tracking Ellis's SUV.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.981
- All right, eyes up.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.375
- He's crossed the Triborough.

29:28.418 --> 29:31.030
- Where's he going?
Where's he going?

29:31.073 --> 29:34.685
- Heading west.
To Washington Heights!

29:34.729 --> 29:36.122
We just got up on his phone.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.645
His internet, there are
lots of searches

29:37.688 --> 29:40.387
relating to Trans For Life,
a nonprofit.

29:40.430 --> 29:43.085
Address is... 14 165th Street.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.652
- That's the target.
Throw it up!

29:44.695 --> 29:46.349
Get a team of agents
over there right away

29:46.393 --> 29:48.569
and pull up any
and all live video feeds

29:48.612 --> 29:51.354
in and around the target.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.488
Scola, head over
to 14 165th Street now.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.970
Ellis is gonna attack
Trans For Life.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.015
- Trans For Life office
is over there.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.800
SWAT's clearing the building
as we speak.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.802
- Are we sure Ellis is actuallyhere in the vicinity?

30:03.845 --> 30:05.673
- According to Jubal,
the last visual contact

30:05.716 --> 30:08.067
was at 163rd and Riverside.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.459
- Probably found
a place to park,

30:09.503 --> 30:10.939
which means he's on foot
walking north

30:10.983 --> 30:12.201
towards the office building.

30:12.245 --> 30:15.291
I'll go east, you go west.

30:15.335 --> 30:18.468
[suspenseful music]

30:18.512 --> 30:25.432
â™ª

30:31.133 --> 30:32.918
- I got eyes
on Ellis's vehicle.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.659
It's parked on the south side
of 162nd.

30:35.703 --> 30:41.056
Exact address is 122 162nd.

30:41.100 --> 30:45.931
â™ª

30:45.974 --> 30:48.411
Car's empty, and I want a bomb
team out here right away.

30:48.455 --> 30:51.023
This thing could be rigged.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.894
[phone ringing]

30:52.938 --> 30:55.288
- Hey, what's going on?
- Any sign of William?

30:55.331 --> 30:57.812
- No, I haven't seen him.
But what's up with that SUV?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.770
- It's clean, but the dogs
detected chemicals,

30:59.814 --> 31:01.337
so it's likely a bomb
was in the vehicle

31:01.381 --> 31:04.079
within the past hour or so,
meaning...

31:04.123 --> 31:05.472
- Ellis is carrying it.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.648
- We also found a pamphlet
for another charity.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.651
It's "Black and Proud NYC"
on Broadway.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.479
Could be we're chasing
the wrong target.

31:12.522 --> 31:15.003
- Okay, I'm heading west now.
- Okay, good.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.831
I'm sending the SWAT team
there now to evacuate.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.354
- Hold up.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.531
I see him.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.229
He's wearing blue jeans,
a tan jacket,

31:23.272 --> 31:24.883
and he's carrying
a blue backpack.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.362
- Okay, wait for backup.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.147
- He's headed towards
the building, the target.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.627
- Okay, okay.
I'm sending a team to you now.

31:30.671 --> 31:33.761
â™ª

31:33.804 --> 31:35.502
- William Ellis!
FBI.

31:35.545 --> 31:38.374
Stop walking.
I said stop walking!

31:38.418 --> 31:39.898
Are you sure there's a bomb
in that backpack?

31:39.941 --> 31:41.247
'Cause this dude
is not complying.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.510
- Yes, I told you,
the dog got a chemical hit.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.642
- I've had dogs alert
to bubble gum, bruh.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.122
What I'm asking is,
is the dog good?

31:47.166 --> 31:48.515
Can I trust him?
- Yes.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.212
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.648
[disconnect tone]

31:52.998 --> 31:54.173
- William Ellis!

31:54.216 --> 31:55.914
Put your hands up
and stop walking!

31:55.957 --> 31:58.090
I will not ask again!

31:58.133 --> 32:05.227
â™ª

32:14.410 --> 32:16.891
- [heavy breathing]

32:16.935 --> 32:19.981
[tense music]

32:20.025 --> 32:27.119
â™ª

32:30.383 --> 32:31.862
- Backpack is hot.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.212
Going to try and defuse it.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.954
- I told you that dog was good.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.869
- I know.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.741
Thanks.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.092
- Good news--
we just took Ellis down.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.485
He was pronounced dead
at the scene.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.443
He had a pipe bomb
in his backpack.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.836
- Okay.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.273
It means our friend Zayne
is no longer an asset.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.449
Keep talking to him.
Make him comfortable.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.755
And then lure him to the window

32:54.798 --> 32:57.105
on the southwest side
of the cafÃ©.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.802
Tell him there's an SUVthere waiting for him.

32:58.846 --> 33:01.153
- No, I can't do that.
- I'm not asking.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.981
- He's my informant,
my friend.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.635
- Yeah, but how he's taken
seven people hostage.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.602
- I'll go inside.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.691
If I talk to him in person,
I can get him to surrender.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.258
- That's a really dumb idea.
- Yeah, well,

33:19.301 --> 33:20.520
it's a hell of a lot better
than trying to take him out

33:20.563 --> 33:22.348
with a sniper rifle
from 50 yards.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.958
What if you miss, huh?

33:24.002 --> 33:27.179
He'll snap and light up every
single person in that cafÃ©.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.443
- Stand down, Zidan.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.488
Hey, you going in there
elevates the risk!

33:32.532 --> 33:35.100
- Yeah, for me.
Not the hostages.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.971
- You're too close
to this guy.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.277
- No.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.889
I can do this,
and I know what's at stake.

33:41.932 --> 33:45.893
[somber music]

33:45.936 --> 33:48.765
And, if necessary, I will take
him out in a heartbeat.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.813
- Nestor?

33:52.856 --> 33:55.207
â™ª

33:55.250 --> 33:58.079
Give him a shot.Let him do his thing.

33:58.123 --> 34:01.082
If OA says he can do it,he can do it.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.258
You can trust me.

34:03.302 --> 34:06.870
â™ª

34:06.914 --> 34:09.482
- You have five minutes,
then I'm doing it my way.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.746
Anyone dies, anyone gets hurt,
it's on you.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.925
[suspenseful music]

34:17.968 --> 34:23.148
â™ª

34:23.191 --> 34:24.975
- Zayne,
I'm coming in!

34:25.019 --> 34:26.803
- That's not a good idea.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.153
- Yeah, I know.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.546
A lot people seem to feel
that way, too.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.983
But I'm gonna go ahead
and come in anyway, all right?

34:33.027 --> 34:35.769
- No, Omar.
Don't!

34:35.812 --> 34:38.250
- It's just me.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.599
- Okay?
It's just me.

34:39.642 --> 34:43.559
- So calm down.
We're gonna figure this out.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.822
- Put your gun down.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.389
- Okay, okay.

34:47.433 --> 34:54.570
â™ª

34:55.789 --> 34:59.009
Now you put yours down--
it's only fair.

34:59.053 --> 35:02.187
- No.
It doesn't work that way.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.710
- Okay, fine.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.712
I know you're not
gonna hurt me.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.279
And I know you're not gonna
hurt those people,

35:07.322 --> 35:08.802
because you are a good kid,
Zayne.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.543
- Quit playing me, Omar!

35:10.586 --> 35:11.892
- Why do you keep saying that?

35:11.935 --> 35:14.721
Zayne, I have never
lied to you ever.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.157
- Really?

35:16.201 --> 35:18.028
You lied to me earlier today.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.336
- What are you talking about?

35:21.380 --> 35:23.338
- You never texted your friend
at the FBI.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.166
That was just a bunch of crap

35:25.210 --> 35:27.168
to get me investedin the mission!

35:27.212 --> 35:29.736
You're just using me!

35:31.129 --> 35:33.305
Yeah.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.524
Show me your phone.

35:35.568 --> 35:38.310
Yeah, I want to see the text.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.877
Come on.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.314
Or, you know what?

35:42.357 --> 35:44.403
You, big guy.
Get up.

35:44.446 --> 35:47.145
Come right over here.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.060
And get on your knees.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.106
Omar, I swear to God,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.630
show me your phone
or I'm gonna shoot this guy.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.806
- Prepare to engage.
- Yes. sir.

He's on me.

Okay.
It's there, take it.

- I, uh...

â™ª

36:38.283 --> 36:40.415
You really texted him?

36:40.459 --> 36:46.291
â™ª

36:46.334 --> 36:49.511
- Yeah, man.
Come on.

- I'm sorry.
Uh...

36:54.690 --> 36:56.997
I'm not--I'm not thinking
so good.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.259
- I know.

36:58.303 --> 37:01.828
So put the gun down
and let these people go,

37:01.871 --> 37:03.525
and you and me
are gonna figure this out.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.528
You have my word, Zayne.

37:06.572 --> 37:10.140
Come on, Zayne.
Put it down.

Please, put it down.

But you put mein a bad position.

at that particularmoment in time.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.544
- I know, it was a very
stressful situation.

38:05.587 --> 38:08.198
But you know that I'm only ever
trying to get the best result.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.853
- I know.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.899
I know, okay.I'll see you in a few?

38:12.942 --> 38:16.424
- Yeah, right.
The medal ceremony.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.426
- It's gonna be great,
come on.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.863
- It's not funny!
- Don't beat yourself up.

38:20.907 --> 38:23.605
Things happen.
Things out of our control.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.215
It's part of the job.
- Yeah, I know that.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.217
- Okay, so when
the ADIC calls your name,

38:27.261 --> 38:30.569
walk up there
with a proud smile on your face

38:30.612 --> 38:33.485
and grab that damn medal.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.530
Okay?

38:35.574 --> 38:37.793
'Cause you deserve it.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.930
Without you, we never would
have made that case.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.196
- Thank you.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.155
[soft dramatic music]

38:52.199 --> 38:59.162
â™ª

39:03.166 --> 39:06.039
Okay.

39:06.082 --> 39:09.912
â™ª

39:09.956 --> 39:12.959
See you later.
- Bye.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.700
- Do you need any help
with the paperwork?

39:14.743 --> 39:16.310
- [sighs]
No, I got it.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.964
New guy does the paperwork.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.227
Don't worry, I know the rules.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.710
I punched my lieutenant
in the face.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.674
That's the reason
I left the NYPD.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.419
- Oh.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.161
- He was drunk and he said
something pretty disgusting,

39:41.204 --> 39:43.424
so I hit him.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.861
I got him good, too.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.429
A couple months later,
an ASAC I know

39:48.473 --> 39:49.648
asked me
if I would be interested

39:49.691 --> 39:52.564
in working with the FBI,
so I jumped.

39:52.607 --> 39:59.745
â™ª

40:02.530 --> 40:04.271
See you tomorrow.

40:04.314 --> 40:10.277
â™ª

40:10.320 --> 40:11.844
- Well, look at you.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.107
- Hey. [chuckles]
Uh, yeah.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.239
I'm, uh, gussied up.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.068
- I don't know what that means.
- It just means I'm dressed up.

40:19.112 --> 40:22.202
I'm, um, getting
a gold medal tonight

40:22.245 --> 40:25.553
for my extraordinary
and courageous efforts

40:25.597 --> 40:28.948
in connection
with Operation Powder, so...

40:28.991 --> 40:31.124
- Well, congratulations.That's amazing.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.517
- Thanks, yeah.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.432
- Before you go, though, um...

40:34.475 --> 40:38.261
I wanted to thank you forstanding up for me with Nestor.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.569
It really meant a lot.
- Of course.

40:41.613 --> 40:44.006
I'm just really glad
that it worked out.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.835
You know, I could see that
it was hard for you.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.229
You clearly care about Zayne.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.101
Probably tough to watch him
blow up his life like that.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.801
- It is what it is.

40:58.673 --> 41:02.242
- I don't want to be late.
- Go, go, I'll see you there!

41:05.811 --> 41:07.247
- You're coming?
- Oh, yeah.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.771
It's not every day that my
partner gets a gold medal.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.036
- Okay.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.082
- Okay, what's going on
with you?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.737
- What?
- Why are you so unexcited?

41:18.780 --> 41:19.825
The operation
was a huge success.

41:19.868 --> 41:22.436
You arrested 16 people.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.526
- Yeah, that's true.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.615
We also killed someone.

41:28.616 --> 41:31.445
Her name was Anna.Um...

41:32.185 --> 41:34.448
She was married
to one of the targets.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.059
She had just turned 22.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.713
You know, I'd spent a lot
of time with her

41:38.757 --> 41:40.628
and I considered her a friend.

41:42.412 --> 41:47.287
The day of the arrest,
she panicked.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.506
And she grabbed a knife

41:48.549 --> 41:51.683
and she ran
towards one of the officers.

41:51.726 --> 41:54.207
[melancholy music]

41:54.250 --> 41:57.340
I shot her.

41:57.384 --> 42:00.213
I didn't have a choice.

42:00.256 --> 42:02.215
[sighs]

42:02.258 --> 42:07.176
But we made 16 arrests, right?
So that's what matters.

42:09.004 --> 42:13.095
I really should go.
I don't want to be late.

42:13.139 --> 42:16.316
Like you said, not every day
you get a gold medal, right?

42:16.359 --> 42:23.323
