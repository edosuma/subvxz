00:31.920 --> 00:33.800
<i>This is an unusual case, My Lord.</i>

00:33.920 --> 00:38.960
<i>The accused was at an unmanned station under
the influence of a strong fortified wine.</i>

00:40.320 --> 00:44.600
<i>Railway personnel from some 20 miles away
manning security cameras</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:48.560
<i>saw him staggering
towards the station's edge.</i>

00:55.000 --> 00:56.280
Lovely jubbly

00:58.960 --> 01:02.760
<i>Would all passengers
stand back from the edge of the platform?</i>

01:05.519 --> 01:08.840
<i>You with the trainers on.
You with the blue tracksuit.</i>

01:09.080 --> 01:12.080
<i>Get back. There's a train coming
through here any minute.</i>

01:14.080 --> 01:15.960
<i>Stand back.</i>

01:16.160 --> 01:18.320
Is somebody taking the piss here?

01:18.560 --> 01:20.680
<i>When will you do what you're told
and stand back?</i>

01:20.840 --> 01:23.960
<i>- Stand back?
- That's right, you heard me. Stand back.</i>

01:24.240 --> 01:26.160
If you say so, pal.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.240
Oh, shit!

01:29.120 --> 01:32.000
<i>See! Look what you've done now,
you fucking imbecile!</i>

01:32.240 --> 01:35.000
<i>Get off that track. There's a train
coming through here in seconds.</i>

01:35.240 --> 01:38.840
What the fuck was that, you arsehole?
I fucking nearly broke my bottle.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.760
<i>Fuck the bottle. Get off the track!
Hurry up! Get a fucking move on!</i>

01:43.200 --> 01:45.120
I cannot find my glasses!

01:45.880 --> 01:48.080
<i>This is God calling.</i>

01:48.240 --> 01:50.600
<i>Get off the fucking track, will you?!</i>

01:50.800 --> 01:53.440
<i>- Get a fucking move on or you're gonna die!
- Fuck me!</i>

01:53.640 --> 01:55.440
<i>Move it, you fucking arsehole!</i>

01:55.560 --> 02:00.400
Oh, thank fuck. Oh! Shit.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.760
It seems to me, young man,
that your profound stupidity

02:19.920 --> 02:22.280
is matched only by your good fortune.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.520
I sentence you to 180 hours
of Community Payback.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.440
<i>If you don't carry out the required work,
you will come back here before me</i>

02:31.680 --> 02:35.640
<i>and receive a custodial sentence.
Is that clear?</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:38.360
<i>No, not really.</i>

02:39.240 --> 02:43.200
The accused stole a yellow and blue
macaw from a pet shop

02:43.560 --> 02:45.880
in the Gallowgate area of the city.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.400
The bird was stuffed inside
a Marks & Spencer's carrier bag

02:49.720 --> 02:51.520
with tail protruding.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.680
On being asked for an explanation
by a police constable, the accused replied,

02:57.760 --> 03:02.560
"Why don't you piss off and start hunting
rapists, mass murderers and perverts,

03:02.840 --> 03:04.840
"YOU grumpy twat?"

03:06.080 --> 03:08.480
The damage to the vending machine

03:08.600 --> 03:10.520
was not as great as first feared, My Lord,

03:10.720 --> 03:13.320
and it has been repaired
at very little cost.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.520
It seems clear this of fence was committed,
unfortunately, through depression

03:17.720 --> 03:22.760
and this recent violent outburst
is a desperate attempt

03:23.200 --> 03:25.360
to get back inside the prison system.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.880
This is a public order of fence, My Lord.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.280
Climbing the statue of the Duke of
Wellington in the city centre.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.280
The accused was under
the influence of drink and drugs.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.080
He seems to bear a grudge
against public monuments.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.240
On previous occasions he has put
a Scottish flag around Queen Victoria

03:45.560 --> 03:48.360
and urinated on Donald Dewar.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.600
The accused had a part-time cleaning job
three days a week.

03:55.880 --> 04:00.360
But during this time she continued
to claim Social Security benefits.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.840
Your Lordship will note there is
a considerable history

04:04.040 --> 04:06.280
of fraudulent claims from the accused.

04:06.440 --> 04:12.000
She seems unable to change her behaviour
of claiming benefits she's not entitled to.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.760
As you will recall, My Lord,
this young man has pleaded guilty

04:15.920 --> 04:18.399
to a violent and prolonged assault.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.640
Now, it is accepted that the accused's
rivals in this case provoked the incident

04:23.120 --> 04:27.400
but, at the same time, the severity
and viciousness of the accused's reaction

04:27.640 --> 04:29.720
went far beyond self-defence.

04:31.240 --> 04:37.240
Both the accused's rivals were assaulted
to their severe and permanent disfigurement.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.080
Given his chaotic childhood, My Lord,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.600
both Mr. Emmerson's parents

04:42.840 --> 04:46.960
were frequently in and out of custody
during his formative years.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.840
Um... he perhaps didn't have
the best start in life.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.080
Your Lordship will note that,
following Mr. Emmerson's release

04:55.280 --> 04:57.040
from Polmont Young Offenders Institution,

04:57.200 --> 05:00.480
the last 10 months have been trouble-free,
My Lord,

05:00.680 --> 05:03.560
albeit apart from this one
very serious incident.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.160
He has formed
a stable relationship with his girlfriend.

05:08.640 --> 05:14.640
She continues to be a positive and
stabilizing influence in his life.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.600
The reason for that is clear.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.200
Within 10 days, my client
will become a father for the first time.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.960
My Lord, the prospects of fatherhood
have changed this young man,

05:28.320 --> 05:31.720
and he would grasp one last opportunity
with both hands.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.080
He has clashed with his girlfriend's father
on several occasions,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.960
which gives rise to serious concern.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.280
Stand up.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.640
Your record is appalling.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.640
For much of your short life
you have behaved like a thug

05:50.840 --> 05:54.400
and the violent incidents in this case
have proven to me

05:54.640 --> 05:57.440
that you are still a dangerous individual.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.920
But you are obviously
a young man with energy and talent.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.720
You have escaped a significant custodial
sentence by the skin of your teeth.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.440
I sentence you to 300 hours
of Community Payback.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.320
Silence there!

06:17.720 --> 06:19.040
Silence.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.120
- Silence there!
- Silence in court!

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Silence!

06:25.400 --> 06:28.000
Quiet!

06:46.120 --> 06:47.440
Oh, fuck.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.520
I cannot believe that, man.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.680
It's okay, Leonie.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.720
God, I thought they were gonna
put you away for years.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.800
I'm telling you, I am never
coming back here. I'm telling you now.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.640
One more time, Robbie,
and you're on your own.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.320
You'd have been safer inside, you were prick.
Watch your fucking back.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.000
- See you soon, you were dick.
- Catch you after, hairy hole.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.320
I cannot live with this. I'm not going to.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.280
Good morning, sir.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.720
I'm here to report for Community Payback.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.720
- And your name is?
- It's Albert Ridley.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.040
- You're not on here, son. - You sure?
Should be definitely on the list.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.880
- Are you sure it's today?
- Aye, Wednesday.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.560
- You're two days out, son.
- What?

07:57.720 --> 08:00.440
- You're two days out.
- Two days out?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.160
There must be... Should be definitely on it.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.720
I'll tell you what. If you can tell me
what year it is, I'll let you come with us.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.960
- What year it is?
- Yeah.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.960
<i>Feels as if I'm fuckin' on
Who Wants to be a Millionaire here.</i>

08:15.160 --> 08:16.240
Can I phone a friend?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.960
It's your lucky day. We're two short.
We're painting the community centre.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.600
- Are you any good with a brush?
- I'll give it a bash, aye.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.400
- Right, get on the bus, then.
- Cheers.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.760
- You all right?
- Aye, I'm fine. How?

08:30.920 --> 08:34.159
- What's your second name again? I forgot it.
- It's a secret. Ha-ha!

08:34.400 --> 08:35.840
- It's a secret?
- I'm no telling you.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.080
- Willy, you been drinking, pal?
- I haven't touched a drink.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.799
- Oh, Willy.
- I haven't touched a drink. Promise.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.760
Look, smell my breath.
No touched a drink!

08:47.960 --> 08:50.080
- Robert Emmerson.
- What name is it?

08:50.200 --> 08:53.280
- Robert Emmerson. - Rob, it's 8:00 sharp.
It's not a taxi service.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.360
- The bus sailed right past me.
- There's a 15 minute cut-off. You're too late.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.680
I've gotta get my hours done, man.
Please. Please.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.080
- Albert, have you painted before?
- Just with a can.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.520
I'll tell you what then. Get a scraper,
you and Davey get some sandpaper.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.320
Get out in the hallway and give it
a bit of a scraping off, will you?

09:14.480 --> 09:16.960
Get it prepared for painting afterwards,
all right?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.760
Scrape the wall?
What do you mean?

09:20.200 --> 09:24.160
Don't take the piss. Get the scrapers,
get the sandpaper, get out there.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.680
Davey, you go with him.
Show him what to do, will you, son?

09:26.880 --> 09:29.680
In the corridor.
Get started as soon as you can.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.320
There you go, Davey.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.320
There you go, the dream team.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.920
Right, you and PC can start on this wall.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.840
Rhino, get the orange paint. You do
the windows, and I don't mean the glass.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.120
Oh, fuck, Harry. No, I hate this color.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.560
- You don't like it?
- No, it's not me.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.600
- All right, boys?
- All right.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.920
- How's it going, Davey, okay?
- Brilliant. Albert here's a dab hand.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.160
What are you doing there?
You're not digging a trench. Nice and easy.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.800
- Nice and easy?
- Just take the...

10:01.880 --> 10:04.160
Like you're taking
the skin off a rice pudding.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.360
- A nice big sweep.
- Big sweep?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.480
- Nice and easy.
- What do you mean? Like that?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.160
How's that?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.160
I'll have you off that ladder in a minute.
Behave yourself.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.960
- That was a nice big sweep there.
- Born to scrape, that's you, Arnold.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.840
Yeah, we do. First time on today.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.440
Well, I can't leave Jean on her own, can I?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.520
Okay, if the office has cleared it.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.480
Which hospital?

10:42.320 --> 10:44.480
Okay. Thanks, Sheila.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.440
- Robbie.
- Aye?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.240
- Your partner's gone into labor.
- What?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.480
Your partner's gone into labor.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.600
I've got to buy some flowers.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.360
That will be nice.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.760
Can I ask you a big favour, Harry?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.360
Here we go. Go on.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.400
Could you come in with me?

11:13.360 --> 11:14.360
What?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.040
I'm scared they won't let me in.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.240
They just take one look at my scar.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.040
Fucking happens every time
I go for a job as well.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.560
All right.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.320
That's her uncles, man.
It's Leonie's uncles.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.680
All right? Leonie in there, aye?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.600
Been expecting you to turn up here.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.000
What are youse doing? Leonie wants me here!

11:58.680 --> 12:01.600
- Fucking leave me.
- What's going on here?

12:03.480 --> 12:06.440
- Fucking leave me! Fucking leave me!
- Shut it!

12:08.840 --> 12:12.360
- Fucking Leonie wants me here!
- Just shut your mouth, eh!

12:12.600 --> 12:15.480
Fucking listen to me, for Christ's sake
She just sent me a text.

12:17.840 --> 12:22.000
Fucking hell, man.
Look, I've got a right to be here.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.480
- I've got a right to be here.
- You've got fuck all, rights.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.800
Get fucking up.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.400
Now you listen here, you were fucking maggot.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.200
Your old man was an old prick.
Your brother's a prick. And you're a prick.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.600
You come from a long line of fucking losers,
and it stops here.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.520
Do you understand? Now, you go anywhere
near Leonie, or the baby,

12:42.720 --> 12:47.040
and I'll rip your fucking balls off you,
and I'll ram them down your fucking throat!

12:47.320 --> 12:49.200
Do you understand?

12:52.240 --> 12:54.640
It's fuckin' my baby, too.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.400
You keep your big fucking nose out of this!
You understand?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.960
You all right, Robbie? Eh?

13:10.880 --> 13:15.400
Bastards. Are you all right, son? Eh?
Oh, fucking hell.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.640
Come back upstairs.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.680
Can you get UP?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.240
Come on.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.960
Come on, come on. You all right? Eh?

13:28.080 --> 13:31.960
Fucking do him. I'm gonna fucking do him!
Get to fuck!

13:32.240 --> 13:34.840
Fuck off, I'm gonna do them! Fuck off!

13:35.040 --> 13:37.000
That's what they want, Robbie! No!

13:37.240 --> 13:39.800
Don't be a mug. No! That's what they want!

13:39.960 --> 13:43.040
They wanna see you behind bars!
Ten years, eh?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.640
Come on, don't be a mug.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.720
You can't let them win like that!

13:49.200 --> 13:52.160
You better fuck off, Harry! Fucking move!

13:52.360 --> 13:54.360
- Come on!
- I'll fucking kill them.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.120
Robbie. Look. Think of the baby! Right?

13:58.400 --> 14:01.840
Think of Leonie! Think! Eh?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.160
Do you want to see your boy grow up? Eh?

14:07.480 --> 14:11.880
Come on, Robbie. Come on, son.
Eh? Come on.

14:16.280 --> 14:20.040
- Do you need any help? - No, we're
fine thanks. It's just a nosebleed.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.280
Here.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.080
You all right, son?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.760
They're thugs.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.720
- Do you want to phone the police?
- No.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.880
I'll help you out.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.640
- No way, Harry.
- I'll tell them what happened.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.000
Harry, look, we never do that, ever.
It's no happening.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.240
Where are you living now?

15:08.680 --> 15:12.320
Just sofa hopping
from mates to mates, Harry. It's...

15:13.280 --> 15:15.640
Trying to get a place of my own, but...

15:16.680 --> 15:19.400
I tell you what. Come back to mine, eh?

15:20.440 --> 15:23.360
We'll get you cleaned up properly
and you can calm down.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.600
Fucking smashed my phone, man.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.040
There you go.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.280
Text Leonie.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.600
Thanks a lot, Harry.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.040
What does Leonie's dad do?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.400
Can you no guess?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.480
Librarian?

16:10.080 --> 16:13.080
No, him and his brothers run
a couple of clubs up the East End.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.000
Cunt makes a fortune.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.200
Fucking hated me from the very first day,

16:18.440 --> 16:21.320
then he found out...
I gave him a nickname that stuck.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.080
Didn't help when somebody fucking
sprayed it over his nice lovely new car.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.000
And what would that be?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.960
"Psycho-balls".

16:31.000 --> 16:35.280
- Have you got kids, Harry?
- I've got two girls. They're down south.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.640
Are youse close?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.160
Is that anybody you know?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.680
- It's Leonie.
- Well, answer it, then.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.800
Take it in there.
Go on, get in the sitting room.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.480
Hello?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.280
Hello?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.520
Leonie.

16:59.640 --> 17:04.079
<i>I did it, Robbie. He's here.
Seven pounds, six ounces.</i>

17:05.119 --> 17:09.640
<i>- A son? - He's so beautiful.
Honestly, he's just perfect</i>

17:09.960 --> 17:12.079
He's got these big blue eyes.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.119
<i>They're just like yours, Robbie,
they're lovely. He's so beautiful.</i>

17:15.359 --> 17:17.440
<i>I'll give you a phone back later,
is that all right?</i>

17:17.599 --> 17:20.880
<i>- I'll speak to you soon. I love you.
- Love you. I'm so proud of you.</i>

17:21.119 --> 17:22.640
<i>- B ye. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

17:26.640 --> 17:28.840
I cannot believe it. A wee boy.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.000
- What?
- I'm a daddy.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.360
Oh, congratulations, Robbie.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.720
Cheers, mate.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.200
- Ow! My ribs, you cunt.
- This calls for something special.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.960
Fucking hell, man.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.200
This was a present off a grateful client.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.560
I've had it for years and I've been waiting
for a special occasion, and this is it.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.840
Come on, park your arse. Eh?

17:57.040 --> 18:00.520
Springbank. Thirty-two years old. Eh?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.160
Whisky? I've never even tasted whisky.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.720
We're gonna toast your first-born.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.360
Fucking hell.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.680
Eh?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.880
- What's his name?
- Luke. His name's Luke.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.960
Eh?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.720
I'm made up for you, son.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.880
This is for... This is for Luke.
And his old man.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.920
Happy birthday, wee man.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.720
Cheers, Robbie.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.640
Fucking hell, Harry, man. Tastes like shit.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.640
You Philippine.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.200
- Can I add some Coke to that?
- No.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.880
I'll give you a drop of water.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.640
- Luke, eh?
- Aye.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.040
That's a good name.
Is it after your old man?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.560
No way.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.720
No chance.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.840
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.040
Sure?

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
Thanks.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.120
I'm so proud of you.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.160
- Are you gonna pick up your son?
- Can I?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.520
I'm shaking.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.200
- So, what do you think?
- He's beautiful.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.960
So perfect.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.360
He's so perfect.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.960
Luke. I love the sound of his name, Luke.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.680
I know. Me, too.

20:44.800 --> 20:49.160
So the midwife said to me
that only half his brain's developed,

20:49.400 --> 20:51.920
and that the next half depends on us.

20:54.680 --> 20:58.080
You only get one shot
at being a wee baby, Robbie. Just one.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.000
You know what that means, don't you?

21:20.400 --> 21:22.160
All right, wee man?

21:56.640 --> 21:59.520
What does "TASC" mean?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.280
Talk After Serious Crime.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.040
Is that the one you went to prison for,
when you really hurt the boy?

22:09.160 --> 22:12.080
Fuck! What do they want to see me for?

22:12.640 --> 22:15.880
Look, maybe it'll just help the boy
and his family to deal with it.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.960
Like cope with the past or something?
That's the idea, isn't it?

22:20.160 --> 22:23.240
- I served my fucking time.
- What about them, Robbie?

22:24.080 --> 22:25.720
Do they count?

22:28.440 --> 22:30.760
Look, I think you should go.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.760
It might help you, too.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.680
Have a seat.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.320
This is Anthony. Anthony's father Andrew.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.200
Anthony's mother Alison,
and Anthony's sister Shona.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.400
This is Robbie. And Robbie's partner Leonie.

23:07.840 --> 23:12.680
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for
coming along to the meeting this morning.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.080
Okay.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.920
<i>It was a Friday night.</i>

23:23.520 --> 23:26.320
<i>I was going out with my girlfriend.</i>

23:26.560 --> 23:28.280
<i>I hadn't seen her for.</i>

23:28.440 --> 23:33.000
<i>all week so I was quite excited
to go and see her. Erm...</i>

23:37.360 --> 23:41.040
We were just parking.
Guess I swerved in quite quickly.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.400
<i>Erm</i>

23:45.320 --> 23:49.760
<i>All of a sudden this guy is kicking the car,
hitting the bonnet,</i>

23:50.040 --> 23:52.480
<i>shouting and swearing at us, saying,</i>

23:53.360 --> 23:57.040
<i>"Get the fuck out.
Who the fuck do you think you are?â€œ</i>

24:00.040 --> 24:05.520
Next thing, he's grabbed me by the hair, he's
pulling me out the car. I can't get him off.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.520
<i>He punches me in the face.</i>

24:10.880 --> 24:14.120
<i>He hits my head off the car bonnet.</i>

24:15.960 --> 24:20.080
Starts kicking into me, I'm on the ground.
Erm...

24:22.320 --> 24:25.920
<i>I just remember hearing Lindsay</i>

24:27.160 --> 24:29.360
<i>begging for him to stop.</i>

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
<i>I just remember thinking,</i>

24:34.200 --> 24:36.400
"This guy is gonna kill me. "

24:38.320 --> 24:39.360
And...

24:40.560 --> 24:41.640
Erm...

24:42.200 --> 24:47.640
The police said that the guy was choked up
to the eyeballs. Erm...

24:50.680 --> 24:54.680
I had 12 stitches in the back of my head.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.360
Broken ribs, cracked wrist.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.520
And, er, my eye was all messed up.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.640
<i>The surgeon said that</i>

25:08.040 --> 25:10.320
<i>I was very lucky,</i>

25:11.400 --> 25:12.440
<i>but...</i>

25:13.920 --> 25:16.880
<i>I had a detached retina,</i>

25:17.120 --> 25:21.280
<i>and I'd lost the sight in my right eye.</i>

25:23.880 --> 25:28.080
He had a fractured eye socket,
which has left him with a squint.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.280
He can't even see out that eye now.
Proud of yourself?

25:33.760 --> 25:36.080
I thought my son was gonna die.

25:36.680 --> 25:38.600
I thought I'd lost him

25:39.520 --> 25:42.480
because of you,
because of what you've done to him.

25:44.200 --> 25:48.000
When he came back out the hospital,
he didn't even want to speak to anybody.

25:48.200 --> 25:52.880
He just wanted to go into his room,
on his own. Do nothing.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.880
He packed in his college.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.520
He split up with his girlfriend.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.200
You're nothing.

26:07.080 --> 26:11.560
You're just a wee thug that doesn't
know any better. That's all you are.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.760
Look at me. I don't even think
you're sorry for what you've done.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.320
Do you realise the pain
and the damage that you have caused?

26:21.520 --> 26:23.640
What you've put our family through?

26:26.920 --> 26:29.600
Is there anything
you would like to say to them?

26:56.400 --> 26:57.600
Thank you.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.520
I felt ashamed.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.200
I did.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.800
I wanted to tell her that if someone
had done that to my son,

27:22.240 --> 27:25.600
to Luke, I'd want the bastard hung.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
Luke...

27:35.800 --> 27:39.560
I swear on your life, and on mine,

27:39.800 --> 27:43.320
that I will never hurt another person
as long as I live.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.360
That's a promise, wee man.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.160
What if Clancy turns up?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.200
What about your promise then?

27:55.120 --> 27:56.760
Will you walk away?

27:58.360 --> 28:01.800
Leonie, if I turn and walk away,

28:02.080 --> 28:05.040
or run away,
not gonna make a difference to me.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.880
- He's gonna stab me in the back.
- What is it between you two?

28:11.240 --> 28:13.520
His dad fought my dad at school.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.560
It's been like this for years,
it's just the way it is.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.240
Just the way it is?

28:19.400 --> 28:22.440
And will Luke fight his son, too, Robbie?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.240
Look at me, Robbie. Will Luke fight his son?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.400
Just stuck in the same shit.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.360
- Scared to lose face.
- In front of who?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.400
Look...

28:38.520 --> 28:41.400
I want you to be a real father to my child.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.800
And if no,

28:44.360 --> 28:48.640
I will take care of Luke myself
and I will make sure he is different.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.320
- Harry, where are you taking us?
- Wait and see.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.200
Now listen, you lot. This is my day off.

29:21.280 --> 29:26.000
And if I get caught out in the van with you lot,
I'm gonna be up shit creek without a canoe.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.800
So I want you to all repeat after me,

29:29.440 --> 29:31.800
I hereby do solemnly swear...

29:32.520 --> 29:34.480
I hereby do solemnly swear...

29:34.640 --> 29:36.440
All of you. Nice and loud.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.760
Anybody don't say it, I'm gonna drop you off
and you can walk back.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.440
- I hereby do solemnly swear...
- I hereby do solemnly swear...

29:45.680 --> 29:50.080
- ... not to fight, drink or rob.
- ... not to fight, drink or rob.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.200
- And I also do...
- And I also do...

29:53.440 --> 29:55.000
- ... swear...
- ... swear...

29:55.200 --> 29:57.520
...to worship the ground
on which big Harry walks.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.800
Get to fuck, man! I'm not saying that!

30:01.040 --> 30:03.440
Too far, Harry. Come on.
Just tell us where we're going.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.000
It's a sacred place.
We're going to a distillery.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.280
Drink? Yes!

30:30.440 --> 30:33.680
So, the first room we're coming into
is the mash house.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.880
This is the mash tun here and it's massive.
Come on, have a look at it.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.080
It's really big. It takes 10 and a half tons
of malted barley,

30:46.360 --> 30:50.320
and to that we add 40,000 liters
of hot water.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.200
What we're doing at this stage
is mixing the barley and the hot water

30:55.440 --> 30:57.320
for the conversion of starch to sugar.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.200
Here we are in the fermentation room.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.920
This is where we ferment the wort
we've just extracted from the mash tun.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.480
It's also where we take
the third ingredient,

31:10.680 --> 31:15.080
the third of the three simple ingredients,
which is yeast, and we add it to the mix.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.760
And as soon as we add the yeast,
because it's been dehydrated,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.640
as soon as we add it to the wort,
it starts to ferment.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.000
I'll show you it.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.240
Fuck me, that's strong, ain't it, man.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.560
Actually, I need a volunteer.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.120
- Who's got a sensitive nose?
- Aye, I'll do it.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.160
I'll do it... I'll do it.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.840
I'll take you.

31:38.840 --> 31:42.720
What I want you to do is just get your head
in there and have a good sniff.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.400
You're at it!

31:53.080 --> 31:57.280
This is called the still house.
It really is such a beautiful room.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.840
Be careful you don't touch anything though.
It's really hot and you could burn yourself.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.560
Come on up.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.600
So this is the still house, and it's such
an important room in the house.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.640
It's kinda like the heart of the distillery.

32:16.800 --> 32:21.520
It's where all the magic really does happen,
and it happens in these four stills here.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.240
If I was to change one of these stills,

32:24.400 --> 32:28.400
I'd have to make sure every single dent,
every nook and cranny was the exact same,

32:28.600 --> 32:31.000
otherwise it could alter the flavour
of the whisky.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.480
Come on, follow me.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.520
She's got the body of a goddess.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.800
Come on round this one here.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.240
Now, there's a subtle reaction
between the wood and the spirit,

33:15.480 --> 33:18.760
because the wood actually flavours
and colours the spirit.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.480
It's amazing. And they were crafted
so beautifully that they actually breathe.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.160
- I'm sorry, you can't actually
smoke in here. - Sorry, man.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.080
- Fuck's sake, you. Give us it.
- I'm sorry.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.960
- You stupid? You no go to school, no?
- No. It's my last fag, man.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.160
- Don't give a fuck, you'll
blow us all up, man. - 'Sake, man.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.480
Stupid cunt.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.840
- Sorry about that, Mairi.
- Thank you.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.880
How long do you keep
the whisky in the casks for?

33:42.560 --> 33:45.480
Ten, twenty, thirty years. It just depends.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.760
- What's the most expensive one?
- The most expensive?

33:48.920 --> 33:52.120
Well, we actually found a cast about...
a cask about a year ago.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.800
And we sold one bottle
from the cask for Â£100,000.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.600
Â£100,000?

33:57.760 --> 34:01.280
You know I could buy 30,000 bottles
of Buckie for that!

34:01.560 --> 34:02.960
That's 30 years of bevvy.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.560
- Unbelievable.
- It's a lot of money.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.280
Andrew,
can you show us how to flog the bung?

34:10.199 --> 34:12.840
Flogging the bung's not something you do
up the dancing on a Saturday night.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.320
It's actually how we
traditionally open a cask.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.440
Thank you.

34:24.719 --> 34:28.360
Now every year about 2 % of the spirit
is actually lost.

34:28.639 --> 34:32.679
It just disappears and evaporates
into thin air. Gone forever.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.199
It's what we call the "angels' share".

34:36.880 --> 34:39.199
- Now who fancies a wee dram?
- Aye, me, me.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.880
I bet you would. Come on,
we'll go back to the visitor centre.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.880
The angels' share. I like that.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.880
That's good. Aye, that is good.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.320
There we are.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.200
Now, our noses are so sensitive
we can actually detect

35:06.440 --> 35:09.800
scents that have been diluted
to one-millionth of a part.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.760
It's our most primitive sense.

35:11.920 --> 35:15.720
Right here goes back to when we used
to crawl about as reptiles on our bellies.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.680
Well, some people will never change, eh?

35:20.040 --> 35:22.480
Did youse know, and this is fact by the way,

35:22.680 --> 35:25.880
the sexual behaviour of mice
is driven by what they sniff?

35:28.200 --> 35:29.680
What are youse laughing at?

35:30.640 --> 35:32.560
- Is that serious?
- Yeah, serious.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.880
So when they smell cheese,
they get a hard-on, is that it?

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
Fuck off.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.880
What I want you to do is have
a little nose of the whisky.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.200
That's basically a wee smell.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.920
And tell me what you think
it reminds you of.

35:46.240 --> 35:49.480
My Da's breath when I was wee,
that's what it reminds me of.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.600
Reminds me of an old pub what used to be
at the bottom of my street.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.440
Anything else?

35:55.600 --> 35:58.400
It's like Christmas cake I had once
at my nana's house.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.640
Well done.

36:00.520 --> 36:05.320
That's really good. The Christmas cake
that you're smelling is the fruity flavours.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.240
Very impressed.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.040
Right as rain. Tough 'un, me.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.440
- How much did you have anyway?
- I had one double and that was it.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.000
- We were watching you.
- I had one.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.680
Put your fags out, boys. It's no smoking
in the van, you know the score.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.960
All aboard!

36:26.160 --> 36:27.880
Did you steal something, Mo?

36:28.040 --> 36:30.520
- Nothing.
- Doesn't sound like nothing, Mo.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.760
I couldn't resist it.
It was far too easy in there.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.200
- Jesus Christ, Mo. You're a
fucking disgrace. - Put them back.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.600
Harry could lose his job.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.560
Do you want them?
I don't like whisky anyway.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.480
No, I don't fucking want them, Mo.
We made Harry a promise.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.240
So you read all these, then?

37:31.840 --> 37:34.800
Cannae get the fucker
out the library these days.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.280
- You bastard.
- Nose it.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.720
Fucking watch that aerial,
it's holding the telly together.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.680
Look at the state of the fucking thing.
What are you talking about?

37:42.840 --> 37:45.560
Fucking Â£6 I paid for that bad boy!

37:49.600 --> 37:52.080
Heavy, sweet and peaty.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.200
- It's like a whiff of sea breeze off it.
- There's something coming off it.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.840
It's... It's a...

37:58.640 --> 38:00.640
Highland malt for cert.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.960
Sea breeze?
All we need now is a fucking rainbow.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.320
I know what you mean. I can...
The saltiness off it.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.600
- Aye. Get that?
- It's sweet, too.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.640
Bullshit. It's all the same to me.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.680
What are you doing...

38:19.880 --> 38:21.200
Albert.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.080
Oh!

38:24.120 --> 38:27.280
- Albert... Fuck's sake, man.
- Fucking hell, man.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.640
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' boggin'.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.600
Jesus Christ.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.280
Here, smell the peat.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.840
Pete? Who the fuck is Pete?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.160
They get it from the ground
then they dig it up.

38:39.320 --> 38:42.600
What? You dig it up
and you throw it in a drink,

38:42.880 --> 38:45.960
and youse are wondering
why it's barking of shite?

38:46.640 --> 38:49.040
Look, give yourselves
a bit of time, guys, right?

38:49.160 --> 38:52.680
I was like that at first, and then
big Harry started to show me how to do it,

38:52.880 --> 38:54.720
showed me the tricks of the trade.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.080
Right, give us it over. Let's try this one.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.840
Fucking volume. Work, work!

39:01.200 --> 39:04.640
Volume, you bastard. Work. Fucking work.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.120
A bit... a bit spicy.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.600
- Where does that smell come from?
- The casks.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.640
It's like, maybe like a short fermentation.

39:13.840 --> 39:19.560
American oak gives off like coconut, vanilla.
Maybe sometimes even like a chocolate.

39:19.880 --> 39:23.560
- That's it. That's it. - Albert,
I'm telling you, mate. It's the truth.

39:23.840 --> 39:27.680
Sea breeze, nutty and now fucking coconut.

39:28.360 --> 39:32.280
Are youse three fucking trying to set me
up here? Do you think I'm fucking daft?

39:32.520 --> 39:36.800
Aye. You're dumb as fuck.
Just listen to him. He'll tell you.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.760
I cannot believe we're having all
this drink and we're no even getting pissed.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.760
Me either, man. I need a fucking drink.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.200
You're not getting a drink,
look at the state of you.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.120
Listen to what this book's saying, right.

39:48.240 --> 39:52.400
"Sense explodes
from the murky undergrowth of times past.

39:52.680 --> 39:56.600
"The dank, dark aromas
of yesteryear waft around us. "

39:56.920 --> 39:58.600
What the fuck is that?

40:00.880 --> 40:02.720
- Good arse.
- Dougie!

40:02.840 --> 40:05.920
- Dirty, skunky, smelly bastard.
- I've got company.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.280
Sorry, troops, but I need
a fucking drink, man.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.360
You're disgusting, you, man.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.600
- Don't you bother!
- Dougie! What you doing?

40:14.720 --> 40:15.760
- Oh my God!
- Oh, don't!

40:15.840 --> 40:17.960
Fuck's sake, man.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.000
Minging, mate.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.920
- Oh, you are smelling!
- Check it out.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.040
You're a dirty, clatty bastard.
Has he finished doing that yet, Mo?

40:31.000 --> 40:35.440
That's actually tasty, by the way.
Peaty and a wee bit lumpy.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.560
Oh, God.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.080
- Sweet.
- Yes.

40:56.920 --> 40:57.960
Look at that.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.360
A wee shot to nothing there.
Just left that long red on.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.800
Is it on?

41:05.240 --> 41:06.640
Four nil.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.600
Points. Four points to nil.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.360
Lucky Alberto.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.320
Albert's played a bit of snooker in his day,
I tell you that.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.040
What the hell was that?

41:18.960 --> 41:21.280
- How did that go in there?
- That's crap.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.880
Oh, man.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.400
Put my balls in that pocket.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.280
Evening, all.

41:31.560 --> 41:35.200
Youse three get to fuck.
I want a word with Robbie.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.840
Fuck off.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.040
You want a word with me?
What, does it fucking take three of youse?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.720
Fuck you, you fucking cunt!

41:46.240 --> 41:47.840
Robbie, run!

41:48.960 --> 41:52.720
Robbie, get outta here! Robbie, run! Run!

42:05.280 --> 42:07.400
You were fuck!

42:17.560 --> 42:19.000
Oh, fuck.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.520
Fucking caught you, daftie.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.080
Right, no cunt touches him but me.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.840
What are you gonna do with that?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.200
Fucking skelped you before,
I'll skelp you again.

42:32.360 --> 42:36.520
Aye, because you had a fuckin' lucky shot.
Put it down, we'll have a square go right now.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.960
Get out of the way!

42:45.280 --> 42:48.280
Clancy! Get a leash on those bastards!

42:55.560 --> 42:57.000
Thanks, Matt.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.680
Shut up!

43:26.480 --> 43:28.480
Look at the state of these scumbags.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.640
Some place to bring up a fucking wean.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.240
Why can't you just give me a chance?

43:35.320 --> 43:37.680
Just one more chance, Matt,
that's all I'm asking.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.840
I'll look after Leonie.
I'm gonna be a good dad.

43:41.080 --> 43:44.600
You don't get it, do you?
It's too late for you.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.160
Even if you wanted to change,
they're not gonna let you.

43:48.440 --> 43:51.840
You think you can reason with the likes
of Clancy and that? I don't think so.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.920
Your only chance, son,
is getting out of Glasgow.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.880
And I'm gonna help you.

43:58.320 --> 44:00.080
I'll give you five grand

44:00.280 --> 44:04.000
to head to London on your own, new start.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.840
For fuck's sake, Robbie, look at yourself.
What can you offer my daughter, eh?

44:11.600 --> 44:14.040
I mean, look at the state of this place.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.360
Look at the state of your face,
all fucking chib-marked.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.760
No job. Never have a job.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.920
Even the Army wouldn't touch you
with a barge pole.

44:24.840 --> 44:29.000
Can you not see Leonie and Vincent
would be far better off without you?

44:29.760 --> 44:30.800
Vincent?

44:31.280 --> 44:35.520
Aye, Vincent. Leonie's baby. My grandchild.

44:36.480 --> 44:40.200
My son's name's Luke. I named him Luke.
It will always be Luke.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.920
Have you listened to
a fucking word I've said?

44:45.520 --> 44:48.400
You're as thick as shite. Go on, beat it!

44:50.520 --> 44:52.920
Fucking waste of space.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.320
You stupid prick, you!

45:34.560 --> 45:38.680
- Consecrated ground. Show some respect.
- I'm soaking. I swear I'm wringing.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.400
You'll live.
What are you doing that for?

45:40.480 --> 45:41.800
Don't listen to him. He's full of it!

45:41.960 --> 45:43.000
He's soaking.

45:43.920 --> 45:46.800
- You all right there, Mo?
- All right, Harry?

45:48.080 --> 45:50.480
- You all right, Robbie?
- I'm fine.

45:51.240 --> 45:55.200
- Everything all right with Luke and Leonie?
- Great, just fucking perfect.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.400
Fucking perfect, Harry.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.480
Listen, I'm going to Edinburgh
at the weekend.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.440
You fancy coming? A whisky meeting.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.560
I'm skint.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.840
I'll get you the ticket.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.840
- Can I come?
- It's a whisky meeting.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.680
- It's all right, I'm into that.
- Are you?

46:17.800 --> 46:18.800
Aye.

46:20.400 --> 46:21.840
Yeah, all right.

46:22.480 --> 46:26.320
Albert! Rhino!
Going to Edinburgh at the weekend.

46:26.960 --> 46:30.320
- What's that?
- We're going to Edinburgh at the weekend.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.560
- Who is?
- Us. Harry's taking us.

46:33.720 --> 46:34.800
Where we going?

46:34.880 --> 46:38.280
Me and Robbie are going to Edinburgh
for a whisky meeting.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.040
- What, are we coming then?
- Obviously it's all right.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.880
Is that a definite? We can come?

46:46.320 --> 46:48.560
- Obviously it is.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.120
Couple of wee glasses of whisky,
that'll be nice.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.080
Willy, you up for it?

46:53.320 --> 46:56.360
- Edinburgh? Aye, I'll go. When is it?
- Weekend, mate.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.640
Oh no, I cannot,
I've got a christening at the weekend.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.920
Bastard.
She'll kill me if I go to Edinburgh, man.

47:01.480 --> 47:03.680
Sorry, Harry, you need to send my apologies,
big man.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.920
Never mind. Maybe next time, eh?

47:15.120 --> 47:16.560
What is that?

47:16.720 --> 47:18.920
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.360
That there. What is that?

47:22.640 --> 47:24.880
What, that big thing on top of the hill?

47:25.400 --> 47:27.240
You cannot miss that. What is that?

47:27.360 --> 47:29.240
- That's Edinburgh Castle, Albert.
- Is it?

47:29.400 --> 47:31.480
- Aye.
- What did they put it up there for?

47:34.280 --> 47:35.800
- Are you taking the piss?
- No.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.040
What did they put it up there for?
Look at it.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.120
What did they put it up...
How the fuck do I know?

47:42.040 --> 47:45.320
- You don't recognise Edinburgh Castle?
- No. I wouldn't have been asking you.

47:45.520 --> 47:49.240
- You been living in a cupboard all your life?
- And what's the matter with that?

47:49.520 --> 47:52.400
- Is there no shortbread in your house?
- You're a fool!

47:52.680 --> 47:54.920
Next time you go home, check all the tins.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.640
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:07.840 --> 48:12.320
the final whisky in our initial tasting,
number five,

48:13.000 --> 48:16.680
is, as you'll see on your chart,
a Lagavulin.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.880
Lagavulin, 16 years old
from the Isle of Islay.

48:21.560 --> 48:26.040
If you have a look at it,
it has a fine deep color,

48:27.000 --> 48:31.840
and a beautiful, rich,
somewhat maritime nose.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.640
Have a little... have a little sip.

48:40.240 --> 48:44.560
Beautiful. It's a lovely sweet start
and then this blast of smoke

48:45.400 --> 48:47.000
just as you swallow.

48:48.280 --> 48:52.560
Very, very elegant.
The Prince of Islay’s it was once called.

48:52.800 --> 48:55.600
- Gorgeous whisky. Like that whisky?
- Yes.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.640
Now then, the final game.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.520
Erm... A surprise blind tasting,

49:04.440 --> 49:07.080
for which I need four volunteers.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.600
Four volunteers.

49:09.720 --> 49:12.000
- Yes, sir. Great.
- I'll do it.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.520
First volunteer.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.360
- What's your name?
- I'm Garrett from Oakland, California.

49:18.560 --> 49:21.720
- California? Welcome to Edinburgh.
- The West Coast. Thank you.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.840
- Yes, sir, well done.
- Ian McDonald, Inverness.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.000
Inverness. Welcome to Edinburgh.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.640
Now come on, we need another two.

49:29.840 --> 49:33.160
I was just thinking.
One of you young guys at the back.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
Let's get a younger nose.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.360
I'll go with you, I'll go with you.

49:44.840 --> 49:48.120
- Well done. What's your name, son?
- I'm Robbie from Carntyne.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.640
Hi. Welcome.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.920
- Hi. Harry from Manchester.
- From Manchester?

49:52.120 --> 49:55.240
Oh, we've got a range...
a range of locations.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.200
Okay. One whisky.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.360
I'll come round in front of you.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.400
Thank you.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.720
And I want you to try and describe it.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.560
And possibly to guess which one it is.

50:10.840 --> 50:14.360
Um... The color tells you
that it's probably got a bit of...

50:14.600 --> 50:18.760
It's probably a mix of casks,
both of American oak and European oak.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.600
A sweet nose.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.400
Come on, describe it to me. Fruity?

50:26.560 --> 50:29.320
- Polish I'm smelling...
- Polish? Yes.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.680
- Wax polish.
- What, like furniture polish?

50:32.920 --> 50:35.160
Yes. Leather and polish and...

50:35.520 --> 50:36.720
I'd certainly agree with that.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.280
So, in the mouth.

50:43.720 --> 50:48.000
Big sweetness to start with.
And then tannic, drying.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.320
Again, it's certainly got
some European oak...

50:53.320 --> 50:55.920
Robbie? Come on, have a wee guess.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.760
I was thinking maybe, er...

50:59.520 --> 51:02.760
A Glenfarclas or maybe a Cragganmore.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.560
Well, you know,
that's very interesting because

51:05.760 --> 51:09.160
I was really swithering
between those two myself. Erm...

51:10.040 --> 51:12.800
- Choose one.
- Glenfarclas.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.440
Okay. Well, I'll say Cragganmore.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.080
Cragganmore.

51:24.320 --> 51:27.040
I don't usually get it right, actually.

51:27.240 --> 51:30.520
Well done, boys. That was very good.
You were very close, all of you.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.120
Well done. That's great.

51:40.560 --> 51:43.840
In your personal opinion,
not from a book or anything,

51:44.080 --> 51:48.840
what is the finest tasting whisky
in the world that you've ever tasted?

51:49.760 --> 51:52.040
Last night, coincidentally,

51:52.560 --> 51:57.520
I was asked to look at a sample
of a whisky which...

51:58.240 --> 52:01.480
I really do think would be a 10,
a 10 out of 10.

52:01.720 --> 52:04.720
It was the most incredible whisky.

52:04.920 --> 52:09.120
- Can you tell us what it was?
- Come on, please.

52:10.720 --> 52:14.920
But it will come to auction
within the next couple of weeks,

52:15.160 --> 52:18.520
and my goodness, it'll be all over the...
all over the press.

52:18.760 --> 52:22.680
Erm... It was a strange story
associated with it because

52:22.920 --> 52:27.280
the distillery itself closed
in the early 1960s

52:27.600 --> 52:30.200
and the cask was discovered in a warehouse

52:30.360 --> 52:35.520
a long, long way from where
the original making distillery was located.

52:36.480 --> 52:41.480
And it's supposed that it might have been
an exchange on marriage

52:41.800 --> 52:45.840
between the manager of the distillery
which made this whisky

52:46.080 --> 52:49.760
and the manager of the distillery
where it was found.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.800
You said it's going
to public auction.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.440
Can you give me an idea... a rough idea
of how much a bottle would be worth?

52:56.720 --> 53:00.320
This whisky is so rare... that, erm...

53:01.160 --> 53:06.000
it's unknown.
And a cask of it is simply beyond price.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.120
Never judge a book by its cover, eh?

53:23.760 --> 53:25.600
Can I ask you something?

53:26.520 --> 53:27.960
Try this.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.560
What do you think?

53:34.680 --> 53:36.000
That's easy.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.400
Where did you pick that up?

53:38.560 --> 53:40.840
You've got a very good nose.

53:41.040 --> 53:44.720
Here. Take my card. You never know.

53:47.040 --> 53:50.360
- Thaddeus Maloney?
- Whisky collector.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.240
Know how that whisky guy?

54:00.440 --> 54:03.960
He was standing talking to somebody
and left his papers on the table.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.200
I nicked this from the pile.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.200
I know where the distillery is and the cask.
It's a Malt Mill.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.200
Are you fucking mad, Mo?

54:12.400 --> 54:15.200
What? This could be our big chance
to make money, Robbie.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.720
Make money? If I get caught doing anything
like that, I'll get five years at least.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.480
Do you think they're gonna suspect
scruffs like us?

54:23.720 --> 54:26.640
Look, Mo, I've told Leonie,
I'm done with all of that.

54:26.880 --> 54:30.640
Just hurry up, man. Look, you get caught
every time anyway. Come on.

54:42.080 --> 54:45.280
- Are you sure you have the right address?
- I'm positive.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.720
Maybe I should just wait.
Don't want to fuck up, Leonie.

54:48.920 --> 54:53.720
It's all right, she knows all about you.
Look, it's my auntie's best pal. Come on.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.280
It's on a timer so just change it
to suit yourselves, yeah?

55:03.520 --> 55:05.400
Show you the bathroom? Okay.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.160
Oh, and fridge and freezer's just there.

55:10.720 --> 55:15.120
Basic bathroom. Toilet down the back.
Sink's just there and you've got a bath.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.520
And there's actually a shower over the bath.

55:17.680 --> 55:20.160
And I'll show you, the bedroom's just here.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.360
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.040
What I'll do is,
I'll clear out some space in the wardrobe

55:29.200 --> 55:31.840
so you can hang up your belongings.
Give you plenty of room.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.120
All right, well, I'll show you
the living room.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.840
It's so beautiful.

55:50.360 --> 55:52.040
Robbie, what do you think?

55:56.080 --> 55:58.000
Why are you doing this for us?

55:58.920 --> 56:01.840
Someone gave me a chance once
and it changed my life.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.160
And it sure sounds like
you two could do with some luck.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.280
Anyway, I'm only in London for six months.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.840
Thanks, Grace.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.240
Thank you.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.880
Now, I can drop you off in the city centre.
Is that okay?

56:19.120 --> 56:20.760
That'd be great.
Thanks very much, that's perfect.

56:20.880 --> 56:22.840
- Thanks, Grace.
- No problem. It's just over here.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.840
Hey, wee man, don't start crying now.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.960
I'll take him.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.440
There you go. That's a good boy.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.560
Leonie, do you want to just go
and I'll catch up with you later?

56:57.760 --> 57:00.920
- How? What's up? - Nothing.
I just want to get a feel for the area.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.600
- It's still a bit of a shock.
- That's fine.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.480
Aye, okay. Just give me a call, then.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.160
- See you later.
- See you later, right.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.720
You fucking prick! Fucking following me!

57:16.920 --> 57:19.760
- No, I was seeing my pal.
- Seeing a pal?

57:20.280 --> 57:21.880
Fucking dick.

57:29.800 --> 57:32.120
Do you no fucking understand, you prick?
Eh?

57:33.960 --> 57:37.080
I just want to have my life!
With my fucking family.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.120
You better tell me the truth
or you're getting it. Did you follow me?

57:41.480 --> 57:42.480
HOW?

57:42.640 --> 57:46.120
On my motorbike across the road.
Clancy told me to.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.800
- Have you told him yet?
- No! And I will not.

57:48.960 --> 57:52.200
- Who were you fucking texting then?
- I was texting my fucking mate!

57:52.840 --> 57:54.280
Give me the phone.

57:54.480 --> 57:57.480
- Show me the fucking phone!
- Right. Here you are.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.440
Don't fucking move.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.040
Fuck!

58:04.640 --> 58:08.240
- Fucking knows the address! - I'm sorry,
mate. He's lost the fuckin' plot!

58:08.520 --> 58:11.680
You better fucking tell me.
It's so fucking perfect here.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.320
You've fucking ruined everything for me now.

58:14.760 --> 58:18.920
You're fucking lucky, Sniper. You're lucky
I'm not taking your fucking eye out right now.

58:19.360 --> 58:22.640
Stay there. Don't fucking follow me. Prick!

58:25.200 --> 58:27.520
- Give me my fucking phone back.
- Fuck off!

58:27.960 --> 58:29.600
Fuck you.

58:47.040 --> 58:49.600
Wrong bike, you prick!

58:49.840 --> 58:52.120
Shit! Fuck.

59:00.800 --> 59:04.680
I'm fucking gonna explode, Harry.
I can feel it in my bones.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.280
I'm scared. Scared the next time
I won't be able to stop.

59:10.120 --> 59:14.200
I was this close. This fucking close
to taking someone's eye out.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.560
I scared myself, Harry.

59:19.480 --> 59:23.640
Leonie's dad's right. Once you're involved
in this shit you cannot get out.

59:23.880 --> 59:25.440
Leonie's dad?

59:26.760 --> 59:30.000
All you've gotta do is keep your head down.
Keep out of sight for awhile.

59:30.960 --> 59:33.680
- Gonna fuck off to London, Harry.
- What?

59:34.640 --> 59:36.440
Gonna fuck off to London.

59:40.120 --> 59:42.680
Psycho-balls offered me five grand.

59:44.040 --> 59:47.480
You what? Leonie's dad's gonna help you?

59:50.200 --> 59:52.120
He's bought you off?

59:52.320 --> 59:55.400
I don't believe this. You're gonna piss off
and leave Leonie and Luke?

59:55.640 --> 59:57.480
Harry, what am I meant to do?

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.840
I cannot get a job.
I cannot even get an interview for a job.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.520
I cannot drag my family
through a homeless unit.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.280
They're better off where they are.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.800
Listen, you can't do this.
Now, take it from me.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.920
Time passes and things change.
You might never see them again.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.120
You can't do this.
There's gotta be something else.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.280
Have you ever tried a Malt Mill?

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480
What?

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.440
A Malt Mill, have you ever tried it?

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.920
No, I haven't, no.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.280
It's... It's the Holy Grail.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.880
This is, without doubt, a genuine
Malt Mill, the only cask left in existence,

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.160
and since there are only three known bottles,
and two of these are suspected fakes,

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.240
every serious collector
in the world would pay a fortune.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.720
In my view, it is likely that the sale could
raise in excess of a million pounds.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040
What?

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.520
- No way.
- Fuck me.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.840
A million smackeroonies.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.040
My body is pure shaking, honestly.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.480
If you were a man you'd have a hard-on.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.880
Have a wee seat, guys. Please. Just till
we have a serious think about this.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.160
I mean, what is that? Like a quarter
of a million each or something?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.760
Right, this is what's happening.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.760
They're gonna have the auction
where the cask is,

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.960
away up North in Dornoch Firth.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.280
Then what they'll do is invite
the richest collectors, dealers,

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.280
to come for a tasting session
with the Grand Master.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.760
- That's followed by a cellik in
a local hotel. - A ceilidh you mean?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.960
Well, a ceilidh, smartarse. In a
local hotel, and that's the 16th of June.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.640
What the fuck is a "Firth"? Dornoch Firth?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.400
We'll probably need huskies,
maybe even a boat, depending where it is.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.960
Even if we find this place,
how are we gonna get away with it?

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.040
It'll be like fucking Alcatraz or something.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.160
And then when we get it,
who's gonna take it off of scum like us?

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.600
Speak for yourself.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.320
It's equivalent to having
the Mona Lisa in your bedroom.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.360
Mona who?

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.120
Mona Lisa.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.640
You know, the Mona Lisa.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.960
All right, I'm just asking, fuck's sake.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.440
You know, when I was in prison,
I met this old guy.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.080
Smart old cunt. Used to read books and that.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.880
And he used to tell a tale about
an Arab smuggler

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.760
who used to go across the border
every day with bags of straw and his donkey.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.760
He admitted to the guards he was a smuggler,
so every day they used to search him.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.480
They couldn't find a thing.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.600
Once he retired, one of the guards found him
one day and says to him,

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.360
"Right, come on, tell us. You've gotta
tell us now. What have you been smuggling?"

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.680
The old guy smiles and turns round
and says, "Donkeys.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.120
"I was smuggling donkeys. "

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.800
How in the name of fuck
can we get a donkey away up there?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.840
- You're a donkey.
- I was just about to say that.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.640
We're taking a donkey.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.440
Thing is, look at us. Eh? We'll stick out
like a couple of sore thumbs up there.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.400
May as well have "Criminals on community
service" tattooed on our forehead.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.720
We're all wearing trackies.
We look like neds, right?

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.680
You put on a suit then
it just looks like we're going to court.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.640
Especially you, Robbie.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.520
I know what you're saying, guys.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.240
Kilts!

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.840
We could wear kilts.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.200
Nobody ever bothers anybody wearing a kilt.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.640
We'd just look like friendly wee cunts
up the Highlands.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.120
Whisky train spotters, know what I mean?

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.920
Albert Einstein.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.800
Albert Einstein?
Who the fuck's that?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.000
He was a friend of Mona's.
Remember Mona?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.920
For fuck's sake. We're back to Mona now.
What's next, "donkey"? Come on.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.040
Arse!

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.880
Arse!

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.000
- Come on. Please!
- Now they've gotta let us on.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.840
Stop the bus!

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.600
They're stopping. They're stopping.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.480
What did I tell you?

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.880
<i>Fuck me. Sound Of Music.</i>

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.120
Hey, Albert!

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.160
Sorry, Sisters, you cannot control
these Protestants, you know.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.080
<i>â™ª I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.720
<i>â™ª Just to be the man who walked
a thousand miles</i>

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.480
<i>â™ª To fall down at your door</i>

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.080
<i>â™ª When I'm working
Yes I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.880
<i>â™ª I'm gonna be the man
who's working hard for you</i>

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.600
<i>â™ª And when the money
comes in for the work I do</i>

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.120
<i>â™ª I'll pass almost every penny on to you</i>

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.200
<i>â™ª When I come home
â™ª When I come home</i>

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.880
<i>â™ª Oh, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.160
<i>â™ª I'm gonna be the man
who comes back home to you</i>

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.000
<i>â™ª And if I grow old
Well, I know I'm gonna be</i>

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.600
<i>â™ª I'm gonna be the man
who's growing old with you</i>

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.760
<i>â™ª But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more... â™ª</i>

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.480
Cheese!

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.160
Lovely. Thank you.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.720
Are you from Highlands?

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.920
Actually, my great, great grandfather,
he was a Highland chief.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.400
This kilt is the tartan and I wear it
with pride every time I put it on.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.880
That's why you wear it back to front?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.960
Oh, right.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:07.000
<i>â™ª But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.400
<i>â™ª Just to be the man who walks
a thousand miles... â™ª</i>

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.800
Albert. Come on, mate. Nearly there.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.080
Come on to fuck, mate.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.560
It's this sporran, man,
it keeps banging off my tadger.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:26.360
My fucking balls are killing. Fucking no
wonder the Highlands are deserted, man.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.880
Fucking, my meat and two veg
are taking a hammering here.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.320
God.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.840
Clatty tadger.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.880
It's no your sporran
that's hurtin' your baws.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.760
Guys! What the fuck youse playing at?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.480
It's Alberto!

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.280
Fucking in agony here. Fuck's sake,
and you're leaving me away behind?

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.600
And I'm starving.
Fucking palpi-fucking-tations in my heart.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.880
Fucking chaffed bollocks.
I'm fucking raging.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.920
Shocking by the way. Youse are shocking.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.520
All right.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.840
- Fuck's sake, man.
- Fuck's sake, Albert. What you doing?

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.680
Fucking howling hoofs!

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.480
Give us one of those pieces over, eh?

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.280
Fuck off! Go and wash your hands,
you clatty bastard. Disgustin'!

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.440
- Look, mate, that'll cheer you up
- For God's sake!

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.520
Balblair Distillery.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.320
The promised land. Treasures in there, mate.
Fucking treasures.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.000
Ah, but one wee problem.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.200
It's in there, we're out here.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.760
No fucking plan,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.080
and I'm risking my foreskin for fuck all.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.520
Before we left I made a phone call.
We're gonna go and meet somebody.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.840
What the fuck have you been up to?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.760
Just fucking trust me and you'll find out.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:18.960
- How you doin?
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.600
All the way from Glasgow, eh?
That's an impressive trip.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.240
So this is the Carntyne Malt Whisky Club?

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:29.920
Well, thanks for seeing us, Mr. Dobie.
We're just newly set up.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.680
My name's Robbie. I'm the President.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.520
This here's Albert, Financial Secretary.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.800
Rhino looks after new membership.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.920
And Mo, Social Secretary and general
procurement of whatever we need.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:46.120
Oh, very impressive. Good.
And what can we do for you?

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.800
Well, we've read the reports and, for us,

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.600
the auction of a Malt Mill is
more important than landing on the moon.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.040
We've come to ask for your autograph
and, if possible, for the newsletter,

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.200
could we get a photograph of you
with the cask?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.560
And only if it's no bother, also,

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.399
if you could let us witness the tasting with
the Master of Quaich, Mr. Rory McAllister.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.000
It's just so we could tell the grandchildren
that we were there.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.880
Isn't that sweet?

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.840
It's more than sweet.
This is just so impressive.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.000
- That ain't very good, is it?
- It's up, isn't it?

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.960
Do you know something?

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.840
I can't believe you dragged us all the way
up here to risk us to get the jail for fuck all.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.600
Shut it. Give us your Irn-Bru bottles.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.040
They've even got our photos as well now.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.720
With my record,
when they know it's gone I'm fucked.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.800
I thought you were smart.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:44.080
Once they know? But they're not gonna know.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:45.960
Nothing's gonna go missing.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.760
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's all good.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.560
Are you off your head?

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.080
And did you no see how fucking big
the lock were on the door?

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.600
And the camera and the alarms?

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.720
The camera and the alarms? There's one
camera. One alarm. There's none inside.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.480
How do you know that?

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.160
I asked the fucking secretary.
The last reported theft was with the Vikings.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.040
Listen, during the tasting,

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.360
everybody's eyes are gonna be glued
to the Master. Right?

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.160
So when we go in,
youse will cover me. No one will see us.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.720
I'll simply drift in
behind the barrels. Right?

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.720
During the night, be all locked up,
I'll give youse a text.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.640
Youse will come over with the gear,
the bottles and stuff.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.120
Hello.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.280
I hope you're not gonna outbid me.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.360
You never know, Mr. Maloney.
You never know.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.080
Right, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Balblair Distillery

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.080
on what is a unique day
in the history of the distillery.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.000
We are privileged to have with us
Master of the Quaich,

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.880
who will evaluate what's in here.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.480
So, without further ado I shall turn you
over to Rory McAllister.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.280
Thank you, Angus.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.320
And may I add my welcome to his.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.280
This is, without doubt,
a most unusual occasion.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.120
The discovery of this
small cask of Malt Mill

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.080
is unprecedented.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.320
Now then, the moment of truth.
Would you like to draw the bung?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.040
Right. Gentlemen...

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.720
Choose your weapons.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.080
Oh, that was well done.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.240
Thank you very much.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.320
You'll see by the color that it's got
a gorgeous deep amber color,

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.560
but not the sort of color
you'd expect from European oak.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.320
This is... I think it's probably been
matured in an American oak butt.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.880
Lovely bright color.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.000
It really, I can...
I wish I could share it with you.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.360
It is one of the most extraordinary whiskies

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.000
I've ever had the pleasure to taste.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.160
It's got these lovely maritime notes.
The faded smokiness that you'd expect

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.280
from a whisky of this age.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.600
Superb.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.120
Absolutely sublime.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.200
Mmm!

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.080
Can I have another one, please?

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.520
Robbie. That's us.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.920
- Happy days, Albert.
- Here, here.

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.840
Right, here, Albert, take that.
Grab that through.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160
Now listen, Albert. Keep it as low
as you possibly can and start sucking.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.520
- Get the bottles ready.
- They're ready.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.760
Don't spill a drop.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.960
Right, go.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.280
Here it comes, boys, here it comes.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.120
- Look at that, man, that's fucking magic.
- That's it, we've got it.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.400
- And don't spill any of that, remember.
- Don't worry.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.480
Listen, I'll be two minutes.
I've gotta check this end, okay?

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.160
Albert? There's nothing spilling, mate.
We're all good here.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.880
- Brilliant. That's us on the fourth bottle.
- What, already? Fucking superb.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.840
Shit! Robbie,
there's a motor pulling into the car park.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.640
Fuck! Give me it in, quick.
Give me it in. Shit.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.760
- Give me this through. Grab the bottles.
- Hurry up!

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.040
I've got the bottles. Just go, all right?

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.240
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.840
Here we are.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.240
I can't believe I left the gauze off.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.880
That'll be the excitement of the occasion.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.360
Glass?

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.760
Thank you, Angus. Thank you.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.280
Right.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.120
I'll die a happy man.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.160
That's plenty.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.440
Beautiful.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.040
Breaks my heart to see it go.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.240
And my little suggestion, Angus,

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.560
who would ever know?

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.000
It's a win-win situation. Nobody loses.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.000
My client only wants three bottles,

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.720
one to keep, one to swap,
one to drink with his friends.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.560
But I don't think he'll match the American.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.200
And what about provenance?
I mean, he'll want proof.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.720
- Not a stickler for detail.
- At that price?

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.640
Drop in the ocean.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.760
He knows. That's enough.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.000
Between me and you and these four walls.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.720
Be quite a nest egg.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.840
I don't have the nerve.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
Pity.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.320

Nation?

Yes, he is.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.400
- Try not to spill any of this.
- Far too precious.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.240

Thank you, thank you very, very much.
Thank you.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.280
Commiserations.

My client gets what he wants. Always.

It's actually congratulations

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.320
on not throwing a million pounds

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.920
Oh, my God.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.800
My God!

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.720
I don't believe it.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.520
How much have you got?

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.360
One to keep, one to swap
and one to drink with my mates.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.720
You didn't do a deal with Dobie?

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.840
Hasn't got the nerve.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.880
You little bastard. I'll be damned.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.760
- How much do you want?
- 200,000.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.600
With no provenance? Not a chance.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.080
"Not a stickler for detail",
that's what I heard.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.240
And that's not all. I want a job.
I want a real job.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.200
- Can you get it to Glasgow?
- Not a problem.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.640
- You've still got my card?
- I have.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.640
Text me your number,
I'll be there Wednesday.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.920
Don't fuck up.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.080
Shit, it's PC Plod.
I fucking know that guy. He hates me.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.240
- Fuck. Come on, we'll make a run for it.
- Nobody move.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.440
- They're not gonna catch us all.
- Nobody move.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.240
Can I have
a quick word, please?

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.120
Good afternoon, Constable.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.520
Hello, ladies.
A little bit of country dancing, eh?

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.280
And what the hell
have you been robbing, Miss?

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.440
Nothing, Officer.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.560
Back up against the wall, please.
Put the bags down by your side.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.640
- Is there any need for this?
- Come on, it's not a talking competition.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.080
You got anything on you
I need to know about?

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.680
No, not at all, mate.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.120
Okay, just turn around.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.480
Okay, just empty your bag out, please.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:25.440
Arms out, sir.
Anything on you I should know about?

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.840
Just my sleeping bag.
Do you want me to open it?

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.520
You not wash your socks, son?

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.960
There was no
washing machine where I was.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.040
Oh, excuse me.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.280
Okay, girls, we'll catch you later,
so to speak.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.240
See you.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.680
Wait.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.920
You think I forgot, eh?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.720
Let's have you.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.560
- Come on. Just come over, guys.
- What?

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.640
Over here now. Not you, Miss.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.360
- Up with the kilts.
- Are you having a laugh?

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.640
- You'll never sleep again, Officer.
- Shut up.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.280
Up, I said.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.680
- Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
- It's a long story, pal.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.880
Go easy.
You better get some cream on that, man.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.840
- Have you got any on you?
- Turn round, for goodness sake.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.960
It's like a fire hydrant.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.760
You want a wee sample there?

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.240
Should have brought my welding mask.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.560
- Is that us done?
- On you go, and behave yourselves.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.360
- See you later, eh?
- No, hopefully not.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.600
Albert, calm down.
Just ignore them. Calm it.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.760
Fucking molesting
some fucking innocent civilians.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.680
- It's cos I pissed him off last time.
- Fucking shocking.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.600
Fucking police, man.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.240
We shall not be moved!

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:06.640
Billy Connolly. Robert the Bruce.
Braveheart, ya bastards!

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.360
Alex Ferguson!
We are the fucking champions!

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.680
Cheers!

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.400
You're kidding me on. Give me that.
Don't spill any more of that.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.960
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.000
Jesus Christ.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.760
Did that really just happen?
You are a fucking idiot!

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.280
You see that whisky pouring away?
That's your share. Gone!

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.440
Story of my life.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.440
- Can I just say...
- Say fuck all!

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.800
Youse are getting nothing! Not a penny.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.920
- Just a little point. - Just a wee
fucking point? You're damn right!

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.800
Fuck up, Albert.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.520
- It's the last thing I'll say to youse.
- You're damn right it is.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.520
See that big fat balls,
I'll nail them to that fucking sporran!

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:08.800
- Listen. - Albert, I think
it's best if you just shut up.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.840
Listen. If there was only
four bottles left in the entire world

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.280
then that makes them very,
very precious. Right?

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.680
Right, but you're just a fucking idiot!

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.760
But if there was only two bottles
left in the entire world,

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.800
then that makes them
even more fucking precious.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.760
Common sense. Supply and demand.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.560
Market fucking forces.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.520
Thaddeus is gonna go mental.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:48.320
I don't want youse winding him up, so
I think it's best if youse just wait here.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.240
Wait here? We'll just come in with you,
it'll be cool.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.320
No, no, no. You are staying with me.

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.200
- You're going nowhere.
- Aye, just wait here.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.960
And, Albert, don't fuck it up.
Don't attract attention to yourself.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840
Right?

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.480
We could have gone in with him.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.080
Stay here.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.560
There's nothing to see.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.680
I can't see nothing here.
The tension's killing me.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.640
- Bend down, let us on your shoulders.
- Oh, fuck off. No.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.480
- Aye, go. He's right.
- Come on.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.720
I cannot stand this tension.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.440
Oof! Albert!

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.240
- What's happening?
- They're just sitting down.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.040
They're just having a wee chat.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.280
Wait for it. Two secs.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.960
What's going on?

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.040
He doesn't look a happy chappie.
Definitely not amused.

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.640
- Who, for fuck's sake?
- Thaddeus.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.200
By the looks of it,
he's just about to have a heart attack.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.840
No wonder. What about Robbie?

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.280
Wait. There's been a development.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.680
- What the fuck does that mean?
- A Checkpoint Charlie moment.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.920
What?

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.840
An exchange of packages.
What else could it mean?

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.640
Here, it's looking good.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.840
Wait, he's handing him
something else and all.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.960
For God's sake.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.960
Don't know what it is. I cannot really see.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.840
- Albert!
- Wait there! Hold it the noo.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.200
Jesus Christ.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.040
Fuck me, man,
chaffed balls part two.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.160
Fuck!

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.040
I think you were easy on him.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.520
Well?

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.480
Relax. A hundred grand.

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.760
Twenty-five grand each.
We'll divide it up later.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.800
- You're lucky.
- Give us a kiss.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.480
- This is brilliant.
- Was he raging?

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.040
Take it or leave it. A Malt Mill.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.000
- This is brilliant. What's that?
- Have a look.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.760
So who's the old geezer?

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.280
It's a friend of Thaddeus.
He runs a distillery.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:39.400
- He's gonna give us a job. Teach us.
- Superb.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.920
You'll probably be up a lonely mountain.
Probably turn into a wee sheep-shagger.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.760
It's not far from Stirling.
We'll get a wee house there, in the city.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:53.640
I can't believe he paid all that money
for just two bottles.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.920
Two bottles? Try one bottle.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.080
- What?
- What happened to the other one?

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.500
"Thanks for giving me a chance. Robbie. "

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.840
You buggers.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360
Classic.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.400
- Do you like it, mate?
- It's crackin', man.

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.160
Grab a bag.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.440
Cheers, Mo.

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.560
What do you think?

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.600
Where did you get it?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.520
- Goes with the job.
- A VW campervan?

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.040
It's because he has to visit
all these distilleries,

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.080
and it's cheaper than staying in a hotel.

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:20.680
- Fucking cutbacks. It's a fucking disgrace.
- Aye.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.520
- Where will I put the baby?
- In the back, come on.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.440
Right, gulls-

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.000
We'll get youse over
once we're settled in, eh?

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.760
Give us a cuddle, big man.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.160
- Thanks, mate, I owe you.
- I owe you, mate.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.400
Alberto.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.320
- Don't let that fresh air wear you down.
- Miss you, mate.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.920
- You take care, right.
- I will, man.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.560
- Mo, thanks for everything, pal.
- Gonna miss you, Robbie.

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.840
I'll check my pockets, you wee cunt.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.000
Mind, guys. Don't spend it
on the slot machines. Do something.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.520
- Be good, mate, eh?
- Take care.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.880
Won't forget youse.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.520
He's turned out all right, eh?

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.280
- A wean, a bird, a motor.
- And a job.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.440
- He's done well.
- He has.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.760
So what now?

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.800
Lots of dosh.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.320
Fuck it. Let's get wasted.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.120
- Hey! All right, good call, mate.
- Sounds good.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.080
You're a scamp, Robbie Emmerson.

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.160
From the first day I saw you.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.740
<i>â™ª But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.880
<i>â™ª Just to be the man who walks
a thousand miles</i>

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.080
<i>â™ª To fall down at your door</i>

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:38.780
<i>â™ª And I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more</i>

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.080
<i>â™ª Just to be the man who'd walk
a thousand miles</i>

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.520
<i>â™ª To fall down at your doorâ™ª</i>
