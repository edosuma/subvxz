Are you okay?
You're not eating anything.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.714
I told you
I wasn't feeling well.

03:45.821 --> 03:48.121
Tell her how great she was.

03:48.123 --> 03:49.890
It's kind of hard
to compliment someone

03:49.892 --> 03:51.725
who's always in a foul mood.

03:51.727 --> 03:52.993
It's a phase.

03:52.995 --> 03:54.630
Keep telling yourself that.

03:56.865 --> 03:58.867
You were really good.

04:03.739 --> 04:05.739
- Mm.
- Tell her.

04:06.976 --> 04:09.643
Your mother wants me
to tell you

04:09.645 --> 04:11.680
how great you are.

04:13.749 --> 04:15.484
Eat shit.

05:57.119 --> 05:59.986
Can I have one?

06:01.723 --> 06:03.023
What do you want today?

06:03.025 --> 06:05.725
- Braid.
- Braid?

06:05.727 --> 06:07.130
You got it.

06:17.173 --> 06:19.173
Let's get your shirt on.

06:19.175 --> 06:20.174
Up, up.

06:24.147 --> 06:26.014
Are you feeling any better?

06:27.883 --> 06:29.852
Not really.

06:31.187 --> 06:33.820
Do you want me to call Dr. Pat?

06:33.822 --> 06:35.755
No.

06:35.757 --> 06:37.158
It's in her head.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.095
She needs to get
her head checked.

06:43.932 --> 06:45.932
All right, come on.

06:45.934 --> 06:47.836
Jacket on.

06:49.272 --> 06:52.038
- Let's go, let's go.
- Where's my arm?

07:35.218 --> 07:37.218
Well, good morning.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.253
- Morning.
- How can I help you?

07:39.255 --> 07:42.789
Um, I wanted to know if I could
possibly take a test.

07:42.791 --> 07:44.057
That's what we do.

07:44.059 --> 07:45.959
That's what we're here for.

07:45.961 --> 07:47.794
Uh, why don't you sign in,

07:47.796 --> 07:50.063
take off your coat,
and have a seat.

07:50.065 --> 07:51.833
Okay.

07:59.142 --> 08:00.842
Yep.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.917
- Hello?
- Hi.

08:10.919 --> 08:14.355
Uh, we've got a girl
out here for a test.

08:14.357 --> 08:16.923
Okay.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.873
Autumn?

08:33.875 --> 08:36.044
You ready?

08:42.017 --> 08:45.018
Come on in
and make yourself at home.

08:45.020 --> 08:49.057
You can just sit here, and...
and, uh, we'll talk for a bit.

08:57.032 --> 08:59.400
What brings you here today?

08:59.402 --> 09:02.836
I just haven't been feeling
that well lately.

09:02.838 --> 09:04.904
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:04.906 --> 09:07.141
How long has that
been going on?

09:07.143 --> 09:08.609
A while.

09:08.611 --> 09:11.945
And when was your last period?

09:11.947 --> 09:14.080
I don't know exactly.

09:14.082 --> 09:15.851
I'm kind of irregular.

09:16.885 --> 09:18.852
How old are you?

09:18.854 --> 09:21.089
Um, 17.

09:22.458 --> 09:25.159
Does mom know you're here?

09:25.161 --> 09:27.829
Uh, no. She's working.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.897
Oh, I understand.

09:30.899 --> 09:33.334
Uh, well, today,
we're going to be doing

09:33.336 --> 09:35.636
a self-administered test.

09:35.638 --> 09:37.338
But I want to let you
know something.

09:37.340 --> 09:42.044
Even if it's negative,
it could still be positive.

09:43.078 --> 09:45.446
What does that mean exactly?

09:45.448 --> 09:49.216
Well, I mean, if it's negative,
you might want to redo the test

09:49.218 --> 09:52.453
in a few weeks
if you're still concerned.

09:52.455 --> 09:54.324
Okay.

10:33.496 --> 10:36.062
So, just dip it in here.

10:36.064 --> 10:38.932
Is that a test
from the supermarket?

10:38.934 --> 10:40.267
Yes.

10:40.269 --> 10:43.272
I told you it was
a self-administered test.

11:11.534 --> 11:14.035
That looks like a positive.

11:18.174 --> 11:20.374
Um, if it's positive,

11:20.376 --> 11:23.144
is there any way
it could be negative?

11:23.146 --> 11:24.478
No.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.916
A positive is always
a positive.

14:45.748 --> 14:47.948
Have a great day.

14:47.950 --> 14:49.583
Hi. How are you?

14:59.228 --> 15:00.661
- Just these? Card?
- Yeah.

15:00.663 --> 15:02.663
- Hello.
- Hey.

15:02.665 --> 15:05.401
- How are you doing today?
- Okay.

15:09.305 --> 15:12.208
It looks suspiciously like
you are throwing a party.

15:13.275 --> 15:15.676
Um, hey, you inviting yourself?

15:17.213 --> 15:19.413
No, no, no,
just an observation.

15:19.415 --> 15:21.749
- What, don't you like to party?
- Uh, no.

15:21.751 --> 15:24.284
Sorry. That's not what I meant.

15:24.286 --> 15:26.553
Well, what time
do you get off work?

15:26.555 --> 15:27.821
Late.

15:27.823 --> 15:29.723
How about if
I give you the address

15:29.725 --> 15:31.727
if you change your mind?

15:35.698 --> 15:38.298
Ten, 20, 30...

15:38.300 --> 15:40.567
- 40, 50, 60...
- Wait, not at the same time.

15:40.569 --> 15:42.571
- You'll mess me up.
- Sorry.

16:40.296 --> 16:42.631
I saw you weren't
at school today.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.334
I went to the doctor.

16:46.368 --> 16:47.737
Are you okay?

16:48.771 --> 16:50.070
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:50.072 --> 16:51.574
What's wrong?

16:52.575 --> 16:54.808
Girl problems.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.543
Bad cramps?

16:56.545 --> 16:57.780
Yeah.

16:59.381 --> 17:00.814
I get those, too.

17:00.816 --> 17:02.716
Pretty much burn through

17:02.718 --> 17:04.818
a bottle of painkillers,
like, every month.

17:04.819 --> 17:06.887
Yeah, same.

17:06.888 --> 17:10.390
Don't you ever just wish
you were a dude?

17:10.392 --> 17:12.394
All the time.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.734
I like that thing.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.771
Oh, thanks.

17:31.347 --> 17:32.513
Hey.

17:32.515 --> 17:33.814
Hey.

17:33.816 --> 17:35.818
Sweetie.

17:48.497 --> 17:51.465
Hey. Hi.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.700
At least someone
in this house loves me.

17:53.702 --> 17:54.768
Hey.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.904
Hey, hey, hey.

17:56.906 --> 17:58.507
Hey.

18:02.478 --> 18:04.346
That's a girl.

18:06.882 --> 18:08.918
Who's a good girl, hmm?

18:12.488 --> 18:14.788
Yeah, you like that.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.524
You little slut.

18:17.526 --> 18:19.793
- Who's a little slut?
- Stop.

18:19.795 --> 18:21.831
What? She likes it.

18:23.465 --> 18:25.532
That's a girl.

18:26.936 --> 18:28.938
Look how easy she is.

19:16.518 --> 19:18.454
Okay.

19:33.602 --> 19:36.538
This is your beautiful baby.

19:38.941 --> 19:42.478
You are about ten weeks along.

19:43.779 --> 19:46.880
Hard to say precisely, but...

19:46.882 --> 19:49.652
everything looks pretty normal.

19:51.954 --> 19:54.554
And this...

19:54.556 --> 19:57.658
is the most magical sound
you will ever hear.

20:32.995 --> 20:34.997
Are you okay?

20:36.065 --> 20:37.766
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:38.934 --> 20:41.768
I know this is a lot
to take in,

20:41.770 --> 20:45.872
but I'm sure once you have that
beautiful baby in your arms,

20:45.874 --> 20:48.775
you'll forget
you ever had any doubts.

20:48.777 --> 20:50.043
I know these things.

20:50.045 --> 20:51.678
I'm a mother.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.981
I just can't imagine that
for myself.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.782
Well...

20:55.784 --> 20:57.884
there are many wonderful people

20:57.886 --> 21:00.887
who want children
and can't have them.

21:00.889 --> 21:04.158
We can connect you
to an adoption agency.

21:05.894 --> 21:08.564
I just don't know
what I want to do right now.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.967
Are you abortion-minded?

21:13.969 --> 21:16.705
Is that a possibility?

21:19.342 --> 21:21.142
Do you have a minute?

21:21.144 --> 21:23.512
Could I show you something?

21:43.732 --> 21:46.967
The video you are about to see
unmasks the terrible truth

21:46.969 --> 21:49.102
that abortion
is an act of violence

21:49.104 --> 21:50.670
which kills a baby.

21:50.672 --> 21:52.672
Some of the children
we'll show you

21:52.674 --> 21:55.742
represent typical
nine- and ten-week abortions.

21:55.744 --> 21:57.744
Because abortions
are never committed

21:57.746 --> 22:00.080
prior to the sixth week
of pregnancy,

22:00.082 --> 22:01.782
every child abortion kills

22:01.784 --> 22:04.951
is already so fully formed
that her heart's beating

22:04.953 --> 22:07.954
and her brain's producing
brain wave activity.

22:07.956 --> 22:10.824
Many of the babies you'll see,
however, range in age

22:10.826 --> 22:13.028
through the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy...

25:04.200 --> 25:05.865
Here.

25:05.867 --> 25:08.271
I'll put this in the bag
for you, if that's okay.

25:56.319 --> 25:57.953
Hey. Are you okay?

26:04.860 --> 26:06.396
Should I call your mom?

26:10.300 --> 26:12.300
No, I'm okay now.

26:12.302 --> 26:14.268
Are you sure?

26:14.270 --> 26:16.038
Yeah.

26:17.906 --> 26:20.408
What did the doctor say?

26:20.410 --> 26:23.078
They couldn't really help me.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.981
Why not?

26:28.351 --> 26:30.353
I took a test.

26:32.954 --> 26:34.390
Wh-What test?

26:54.310 --> 26:56.143
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

26:56.145 --> 26:58.978
Uh, my cousin isn't
feeling well.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.381
What's wrong with her?

27:00.383 --> 27:02.115
She has a stomach bug.

27:02.117 --> 27:03.384
Okay.

27:03.386 --> 27:05.686
I think I need
to take her home.

27:05.688 --> 27:08.922
Well, she's on the schedule
for two more hours.

27:08.924 --> 27:10.124
Can't she wait?

27:10.126 --> 27:11.392
She can't.

27:11.394 --> 27:14.961
It's really just
a few more hours.

27:14.963 --> 27:17.166
I'd get lonely if you left.

27:18.301 --> 27:20.066
I'll be fine.

27:20.068 --> 27:22.003
There you go.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.546
Hello?

32:32.548 --> 32:34.381
Hi. It's Beth calling

32:34.383 --> 32:36.417
from Ellensboro Women's Clinic.

32:36.419 --> 32:38.385
Uh, hi.

32:38.387 --> 32:41.455
Uh, I'd love to sit
with you more and talk.

32:41.457 --> 32:43.257
Okay.

32:43.259 --> 32:46.627
I'm wondering if you can
come back in later today.

32:46.629 --> 32:48.595
Um, no, I'm really busy.

32:48.597 --> 32:50.464
Of course.

32:50.466 --> 32:52.700
Well, how about tomorrow?

32:52.702 --> 32:54.468
Can I call you back?

32:54.470 --> 32:56.670
- Now's not a really good time.
- Uh, no problem.

32:56.672 --> 32:59.373
Or I-I could try you again
in a little while.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.344
- Either way.
- Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye.

33:29.705 --> 33:31.872
I think we have to switch here.

33:31.874 --> 33:33.407
Why?

33:33.409 --> 33:35.277
I don't know why. We just do.

34:44.914 --> 34:46.482
Hey.

34:47.516 --> 34:49.585
Hey, excuse me.

34:54.623 --> 34:57.459
Do you know what time
this bus gets in?

34:59.929 --> 35:01.795
I don't know, like 2:00 p.m.

35:01.797 --> 35:03.664
That's what I thought,
actually.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.634
Cool.

35:07.837 --> 35:09.837
You going to New York?

35:09.839 --> 35:11.972
Yeah.

35:11.974 --> 35:14.376
Freaking love New York.

35:15.978 --> 35:18.745
It's kind of my favorite city.

35:18.747 --> 35:20.781
Yeah, us, too.

35:20.783 --> 35:22.549
Philly's cool and all...

35:22.551 --> 35:23.917
you know, it's definitely
got history...

35:23.919 --> 35:26.854
but New York, like,
I think because of the way

35:26.856 --> 35:28.655
the city's s-set up
and everything,

35:28.657 --> 35:30.424
you're forced to interact
with people

35:30.426 --> 35:33.194
who are just nothing like you.

35:33.196 --> 35:35.497
Kind of like this bus.

35:36.799 --> 35:38.868
That's funny.

35:41.637 --> 35:43.737
What are you doing there?

35:43.739 --> 35:46.707
Seeing family and stuff.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.576
Well, I mean, I know
you'll be pretty busy and all,

35:49.578 --> 35:51.645
but, um...

35:51.647 --> 35:54.648
by any chance,
do you girls like live music?

35:54.650 --> 35:57.751
Uh, we're probably
gonna be, um, pretty busy.

35:57.753 --> 35:58.919
Yeah.

35:58.921 --> 36:00.787
Yeah, I get it.

36:00.789 --> 36:02.791
Sorry.

36:04.793 --> 36:08.595
Well, if you give me your
number, I'll text you the info.

36:08.597 --> 36:10.532
Maybe you'll change your mind.

36:19.575 --> 36:21.644
Here you go.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.616
Just texted you.

36:29.618 --> 36:30.920
Oh, got it.

37:25.141 --> 37:27.574
You girls know
where you're going?

37:27.576 --> 37:28.976
- What?
- Do you know where you're going?

37:28.978 --> 37:30.577
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:30.579 --> 37:31.945
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.680
Okay.

37:33.682 --> 37:35.651
I'll text you.

37:47.629 --> 37:48.996
Uh, hi. Excuse me.

37:48.998 --> 37:50.697
Hey, how you doing?

37:50.699 --> 37:54.901
Can you tell me how to get
to 44 Court Street?

37:54.903 --> 37:57.771
Yeah, take the A or C downtown.

37:57.773 --> 37:59.840
Get off at Jay.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.908
Uh, how do you get...

38:01.910 --> 38:03.877
how do you get
to the subway from here?

38:03.879 --> 38:05.879
Subway?
Just go directly that way.

38:05.881 --> 38:07.881
Go downstairs.
Have a nice day.

38:07.883 --> 38:09.818
Thanks.

40:31.927 --> 40:33.927
I.D.s, please, ladies.

41:11.099 --> 41:13.099
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:13.101 --> 41:15.136
So, we're gonna get you
all signed in.

41:15.138 --> 41:17.971
Um, you're gonna
sign your name over here.

41:17.973 --> 41:20.909
All right,
and then your date of birth.

41:21.944 --> 41:23.244
And then today's date.

41:23.246 --> 41:25.011
- And then your signature.
- Okay.

41:25.013 --> 41:26.813
Let me know if you have
any questions,

41:26.815 --> 41:29.051
- and we'll call you when we're ready.
- Yeah.

41:43.132 --> 41:45.932
Okay.

41:45.934 --> 41:49.803
I just want to review
some information,

41:49.805 --> 41:51.871
and then we'll get you
all set up.

41:51.873 --> 41:54.007
Okay?
Uh, can you start by verifying

41:54.009 --> 41:56.042
your name
and date of birth, please?

41:56.044 --> 41:58.312
Um, Autumn Callahan.

41:58.314 --> 42:00.880
August 19, 2002.

42:00.882 --> 42:02.115
Okay.

42:02.117 --> 42:04.252
And in addition to
the pregnancy test

42:04.254 --> 42:07.588
and the sonogram, we also like
to have you tested for STDs.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.823
Is that okay?

42:09.825 --> 42:12.159
Yeah, that's fine, um,
but I did already take

42:12.161 --> 42:14.428
a pregnancy test,
and I did a sonogram.

42:14.430 --> 42:16.364
Okay. All right, I understand.

42:16.366 --> 42:20.900
Um, but we always have to go
by the one that we get today

42:20.902 --> 42:22.203
here in our office,

42:22.205 --> 42:24.372
with our technician
and on our equipment.

42:24.374 --> 42:26.340
Is that still okay?

42:26.342 --> 42:28.844
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:23.333 --> 43:25.335
Are you okay?

43:27.102 --> 43:30.404
Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired.

43:30.406 --> 43:32.273
Mm.

43:32.275 --> 43:38.011
Well, the sonogram is showing
that you are about 18 weeks.

43:38.013 --> 43:40.113
Does that sound about
as far along as you thought?

43:40.115 --> 43:42.283
Uh, no, um...

43:42.285 --> 43:46.119
the place I went to before
said that I was ten weeks.

43:46.121 --> 43:48.155
Well, there can be
some margin of error,

43:48.157 --> 43:50.291
but it's usually in
the three-to four-day range.

43:50.293 --> 43:52.159
Which is why it's always
important for us

43:52.161 --> 43:53.427
to do them again.

43:53.429 --> 43:56.397
Um, no, the-the sonogram
I did before,

43:56.399 --> 43:58.965
they definitely said
I was ten weeks.

43:58.967 --> 44:01.268
Where was that?

44:01.270 --> 44:04.138
Back in my town.

44:04.140 --> 44:06.342
I have a feeling
that that was inaccurate.

44:08.244 --> 44:10.244
At this specific facility,

44:10.246 --> 44:13.447
in-clinic abortions are offered
up to 12 weeks

44:13.449 --> 44:16.152
after the start date
of your last menstrual period.

44:18.086 --> 44:20.120
Then what am I supposed to do?

44:20.122 --> 44:22.423
I'm going to send you
to our Manhattan facility,

44:22.425 --> 44:25.461
and they should be able to
take you first thing tomorrow.

44:27.230 --> 44:30.264
Uh, can't you call and see
if they'll take me now?

44:30.266 --> 44:33.066
By the time you get
there, they're gonna be closed.

44:33.068 --> 44:35.336
I really can't wait until then.

44:35.338 --> 44:38.139
I just don't think
it's gonna be possible.

44:38.141 --> 44:40.174
But they are going to be able
to give you

44:40.176 --> 44:41.975
the care that you need
tomorrow.

44:41.977 --> 44:43.979
It's gonna be okay.

46:00.223 --> 46:02.123
Look at this.

46:05.828 --> 46:07.628
Who's that?

46:07.630 --> 46:10.096
You know.

46:10.098 --> 46:12.266
It's that guy.

46:12.268 --> 46:14.268
Don't encourage him.

46:14.270 --> 46:16.170
I'm not.

46:16.172 --> 46:18.272
He seriously texted me
three times.

46:18.274 --> 46:20.407
- Look.
- Did you write back?

46:20.409 --> 46:22.243
No.

46:22.245 --> 46:25.212
Well, then delete,
delete, delete.

46:25.214 --> 46:27.015
Yep.

46:28.351 --> 46:30.219
This area's closed.

46:31.454 --> 46:33.287
You cannot sleep here.

46:33.289 --> 46:34.688
This area's closed
between the hours

46:34.690 --> 46:37.157
of 1:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.

Autumn?

54:00.002 --> 54:02.004
Hi. Come on in.

54:04.006 --> 54:06.106
Okay.

54:06.108 --> 54:08.608
So, I'm your
financial counselor.

54:08.610 --> 54:11.611
I'll be helping you sort out
the payment for today.

54:11.613 --> 54:13.647
Are you currently insured?

54:13.649 --> 54:15.015
- Yes.
- Great.

54:15.017 --> 54:16.719
Can I see your insurance card?

54:29.765 --> 54:31.665
Great.

54:31.667 --> 54:34.001
Oh, wait.
Um, if I do this,

54:34.003 --> 54:36.870
would my parents get
some kind of bill?

54:36.872 --> 54:38.739
They'd get a statement.

54:38.741 --> 54:40.574
That's correct.

54:40.576 --> 54:43.912
Um, is there anything else
I can do?

54:45.781 --> 54:48.715
Um, well, why don't we just
figure out what you can pay,

54:48.717 --> 54:50.884
and then the rest, we can...

54:50.886 --> 54:53.354
figure out a way to supplement
with private funds.

54:53.356 --> 54:54.757
- All right?
- Okay.

54:59.661 --> 55:01.661
Oh. Go ahead,
and just hold on to that.

55:01.663 --> 55:04.198
That'll be for downstairs
for payment.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.201
All I need you to do
is fill out this form,

55:07.203 --> 55:09.203
right here,
and we'll get you started.

55:09.205 --> 55:11.540
- Okay?
- Okay.

55:25.687 --> 55:28.688
Hi, Autumn. I'm Kelly.
I'm your counselor.

55:28.690 --> 55:30.893
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

55:36.932 --> 55:40.967
So, you had a sonogram at the
Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn,

55:40.969 --> 55:44.138
and the sonogram is showing
that you're 18 weeks pregnant.

55:44.140 --> 55:46.174
Is that about what you thought?

55:46.176 --> 55:47.841
Um, no.

55:47.843 --> 55:50.110
Okay, how many weeks
did you think you were?

55:50.112 --> 55:52.146
I thought I was ten weeks.

55:52.148 --> 55:55.015
Ten weeks?
Okay, that happens sometimes.

55:55.017 --> 55:58.219
Because you're 18 weeks,
you're in the second trimester,

55:58.221 --> 56:01.222
this is gonna be
a two-day procedure, okay?

56:01.224 --> 56:04.024
Is there any way
you can do it all in one day?

56:04.026 --> 56:05.826
Unfortunately,
it has to be done

56:05.828 --> 56:07.661
over the course of two days.

56:07.663 --> 56:09.863
We have to put dilators
in the cervix

56:09.865 --> 56:12.032
so that the cervix
can open up slowly overnight.

56:12.034 --> 56:16.270
That way, the procedure
can be done safely tomorrow.

56:16.272 --> 56:18.905
Will you be able
to come back tomorrow?

56:18.907 --> 56:20.241
Yeah.

56:20.243 --> 56:21.975
Okay.

56:21.977 --> 56:24.911
I also need to know
that you're absolutely sure

56:24.913 --> 56:28.449
of your decision
to terminate this pregnancy.

56:28.451 --> 56:30.784
Are you sure of your decision?

56:30.786 --> 56:32.153
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56:32.155 --> 56:34.921
'Cause if you, for any reason,
change your mind,

56:34.923 --> 56:36.857
there could be serious
medical considerations

56:36.859 --> 56:39.460
if you don't complete the
second part of the procedure.

56:39.462 --> 56:41.795
- Okay.
- Okay?

56:41.797 --> 56:43.797
Do you have a place
to stay tonight?

56:43.799 --> 56:45.899
I know you came from far away.

56:45.901 --> 56:47.100
Yeah. Yeah.

56:47.102 --> 56:49.137
Where are you gonna stay?

56:49.139 --> 56:52.173
I don't know. I was just gonna
go to a hotel or something.

56:52.175 --> 56:55.309
Okay.
Hotels are pretty expensive.

56:55.311 --> 56:57.711
Do you have the money for that?

56:57.713 --> 56:59.112
I'll figure it out.

56:59.114 --> 57:01.482
We work with volunteers
that can help you

57:01.484 --> 57:02.949
with a place to stay.

57:02.951 --> 57:05.785
I can reach out to them
if you want me to.

57:05.787 --> 57:07.854
Yeah, I... I got it.

57:07.856 --> 57:09.923
- It's fine.
- Okay.

57:09.925 --> 57:11.791
Who came with you today?

57:11.793 --> 57:13.261
My cousin.

57:13.263 --> 57:15.061
Have they been supportive?

57:15.063 --> 57:16.963
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:16.965 --> 57:19.099
Can you tell me
what led to your decision

57:19.101 --> 57:20.936
to terminate the pregnancy?

57:22.138 --> 57:24.938
I... I'm just not ready
to be a mom.

57:24.940 --> 57:26.207
That's totally fine.

57:26.209 --> 57:27.974
Whatever your decision is

57:27.976 --> 57:30.246
is totally fine
as long as it's yours.

57:32.248 --> 57:34.114
Is there anyone
who's pressuring you

57:34.116 --> 57:36.350
to be here today
to terminate this pregnancy?

57:36.352 --> 57:37.851
No.

57:37.853 --> 57:39.119
Okay.

57:39.121 --> 57:41.087
I'm gonna ask you
some questions

57:41.089 --> 57:42.956
about your medical history.

57:42.958 --> 57:44.325
Okay?
There's lots of questions.

57:44.327 --> 57:46.229
Just answer as best you can.

57:47.263 --> 57:49.163
Do you take any medication

57:49.165 --> 57:51.932
or use any drugs
on a regular basis?

57:51.934 --> 57:54.034
- No.
- Have you taken any medication

57:54.036 --> 57:56.137
or used any drugs
of any kind today?

57:56.139 --> 57:57.837
No.

57:57.839 --> 58:00.073
Have you ever had
any medical problems before,

58:00.075 --> 58:02.976
like anemia, asthma,
high blood pressure,

58:02.978 --> 58:04.978
anything like that?

58:04.980 --> 58:06.980
I don't know. Don't think so.

58:06.982 --> 58:08.114
Okay.

58:08.116 --> 58:10.184
Are you allergic
to any medication?

58:10.186 --> 58:11.918
- No.
- No?

58:11.920 --> 58:14.854
You have any allergies
to latex or shellfish?

58:14.856 --> 58:16.056
No.

58:16.058 --> 58:17.857
Have you ever
had surgery before?

58:17.859 --> 58:19.160
- No.
- No?

58:19.162 --> 58:20.894
Ever been in the hospital
for anything?

58:20.896 --> 58:22.129
No.

58:22.131 --> 58:23.997
Have you ever
had anesthesia before?

58:23.999 --> 58:26.099
- No.
- No? Okay.

58:26.101 --> 58:28.935
Anyone in your family
have any major illness,

58:28.937 --> 58:31.905
like cancer, diabetes,
high blood pressure?

58:31.907 --> 58:34.074
- Parents, grandparents?
- Uh...

58:34.076 --> 58:36.876
- No, not that I know of.
- Okay.

58:36.878 --> 58:39.380
And do you have a healthy diet?

58:39.382 --> 58:41.047
I think so.

58:41.049 --> 58:42.216
Kind of?

58:42.218 --> 58:44.285
Do you exercise regularly?

58:44.287 --> 58:46.019
- Not really.
- Okay.

58:46.021 --> 58:48.021
- Do you use seat belts?
- Yeah.

58:48.023 --> 58:49.390
Okay, good.

58:49.392 --> 58:52.593
Any recent life changes
or stresses?

58:52.595 --> 58:54.060
Um, no.

58:54.062 --> 58:55.229
Okay.

58:55.231 --> 58:57.398
Any health hazards at home?

58:57.400 --> 58:59.133
Not really.

58:59.135 --> 59:01.435
When was the last time
you went to the doctor?

59:01.437 --> 59:04.205
Uh, like a year ago.

59:04.207 --> 59:06.039
Okay.

59:06.041 --> 59:08.177
And at what age
did you first have sex?

59:10.179 --> 59:12.313
- Uh, 14.
- Okay.

59:12.315 --> 59:14.914
And what types of
sexual activity have you had?

59:14.916 --> 59:16.952
Vaginal, anal, oral?

59:18.221 --> 59:20.221
- All of them.
- Okay.

59:20.223 --> 59:23.257
And how many sexual partners
do you currently have?

59:23.259 --> 59:25.359
- Uh, one.
- Okay.

59:25.361 --> 59:27.628
And could your partner have
any other partners

59:27.630 --> 59:29.297
that you're aware of?

59:29.299 --> 59:31.332
- Probably.
- Okay.

59:31.334 --> 59:33.134
And how many sexual partners

59:33.136 --> 59:35.236
have you had
in the last 12 months?

59:35.238 --> 59:36.437
Uh, two.

59:36.439 --> 59:38.205
How about in your lifetime?

59:38.207 --> 59:40.073
- Six.
- Okay.

59:40.075 --> 59:43.076
Do you use any condoms
or any other barriers

59:43.078 --> 59:46.180
to protect yourself against HIV
or other infections?

59:46.182 --> 59:47.914
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

59:47.916 --> 59:49.082
Okay, good.

59:51.287 --> 59:53.987
I want to spend a few minutes
talking with you

59:53.989 --> 59:55.989
about your relationships, okay?

59:55.991 --> 59:57.458
Because they can affect
your health.

59:57.460 --> 59:59.092
Did you know that?

59:59.094 --> 01:00:00.428
No? All right.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.463
So I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.432
They can be really personal.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.100
And all you have to do
is answer either

01:00:07.102 --> 01:00:09.969
"never," "rarely,"
"sometimes" or "always."

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:11.439
It's kind of like
multiple choice,

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.240
but it's not a test.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.276
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:20.247
In the past year, your partner
has refused to wear a condom.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.116
Never, rarely,

01:00:23.118 --> 01:00:25.921
sometimes, always.

01:00:27.122 --> 01:00:29.390
Um, sometimes.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.990
Okay.

01:00:30.992 --> 01:00:33.194
And your partner messes
with your birth control

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:36.096
or tries to get you pregnant
when you don't want to be.

01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:39.400
- Uh...
- Never, rarely,

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:43.002
sometimes, always.

01:00:43.004 --> 01:00:44.372
Uh, never.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.072
Okay.

01:00:46.074 --> 01:00:48.376
Your partner has threatened
or frightened you.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:52.112
Never, rarely,

01:00:52.114 --> 01:00:55.349
sometimes, always.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:58.152
Why are you asking me this?

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.989
I want to make sure
that you're safe.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:06.494
Your partner's threatened
or frightened you.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:10.131
Never, rarely,

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:14.168
sometimes, always.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.404
Um, rarely.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.139
Okay.

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.307
Your partner has hit you,
slapped you

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.443
or physically hurt you.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:26.313
Never, rarely,

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:29.918
sometimes, always.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.125
Has your partner ever hit you,
slapped you

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:40.129
or physically hurt you?

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:46.467
Is someone hurting you?

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.204
Some...

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.341
It's okay.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.978
It's just a couple more
questions, all right?

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.414
Your partner
has made you have sex

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.416
when you didn't want to.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:06.052
Never, rarely,

01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:09.559
sometimes, always.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.031
It's okay.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.505
I want to make sure
you're safe,

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:27.210
and I want to help you
if I can.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:37.251
I have just one more question
for you, okay, Autumn?

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.520
Has anyone forced you
into a sexual act

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.288
ever in your lifetime?

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.024
Yes or no?

01:02:45.093 --> 01:02:47.261
Uh, yeah.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.829
Okay.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.664
Do you want to tell me
about it?

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:54.134
- No, not...
- It's okay.

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:58.205
I'm gonna give you my number,
and you can call me.

01:02:58.207 --> 01:02:59.673
We don't have to talk
about it today,

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:02.142
but you can call me
if you need to talk

01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:04.079
or if you need some help, okay?

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.154
Do you have
any questions for me?

01:03:14.156 --> 01:03:16.557
Um, is it...

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:19.493
the procedure...
is it gonna be painful?

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.629
It's gonna be
a little uncomfortable.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.298
Have you ever had
a GYN exam before?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.433
- No.
- Okay.

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:28.669
It's gonna be
in an operating room.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:31.438
There's gonna be a doctor.
There's gonna be a nurse.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.707
There's gonna be
a medical assistant.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:36.577
I can be there with you
if you want me to be.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.546
Would you like me
to go with you?

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.581
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:44.318
Okay, so it's kind of like
having a GYN exam today.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.321
They're gonna put
a speculum in the vagina.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.557
They're gonna put laminaria
into the cervix,

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:53.160
and that's what's gonna help
the cervix open overnight.

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.728
All right, so it's gonna
feel uncomfortable...

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:57.498
kind of like pressure,
kind of like you have to pee...

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.732
but it shouldn't hurt.

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.601
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:04.505
If you have any really bad pain
tonight, you have to call us.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.707
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.609
Then, when you come back
tomorrow

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.444
for the second part
of the procedure,

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.746
for that part,
you're gonna be asleep.

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.916
Okay, and I can be
with you then, too.

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.551
I'm gonna, like, go under?

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.553
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:21.488
Just for about ten minutes.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.357
It's pretty quick, all right?

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.758
- Okay.
- And then,

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.927
when you wake up,
you'll be in the recovery room.

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.295
You're gonna be all done.

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.497
- Then you can go home.
- Okay.

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:31.632
All right.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.367
Are you ready?

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.504
- Think so.
- Okay.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.934
Where's the rest of the money?

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:23.670
I had to use it all
for the appointment.

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:57.807
Why couldn't they
do it all today?

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:02.709
You can go home if you want.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:23.564
Hi.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:24.865
How can I help you?

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.600
Um, I'm sorry.

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.468
We lost our tickets,
and we were wondering...

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.871
is there any way that you
could reprint them for us?

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:32.606
Do you have a receipt?

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.809
No, we lost that,
too, unfortunately.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:39.446
I can't reissue the tickets
without proof of purchase.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.613
Okay.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:43.617
Um, how much
for two tickets, then,

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:45.484
to Ellensboro, Pennsylvania?

01:08:45.487 --> 01:08:47.554
$66.50 each.

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.457
$66.50.

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:52.493
Thank you.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.542
Do you want me to call my mom?

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:09.944
No.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.881
Do you want me
to call your mom?

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.785
No.

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:22.923
Then what do you want me to do?

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.926
Fuck off.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.671
Your attention, please.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:42.097
Look at me.

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:19.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:24.738
How was, uh, your family thing?

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.008
It was okay.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:30.977
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna hear from you.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.715
We were pretty busy.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.117
Want to come with me
to this thing downtown?

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.986
Um, we actually kind of need
to hang around here,

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.755
if that's okay.

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.191
Okay.

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:45.959
Uh, well, let's get a drink.

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.262
Oh, I'm-I'm not 21 yet.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:50.697
How old are you?

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.666
20.

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:55.869
Okay, well, no one really cards
in New York, so...

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.737
Um... if we can just

01:12:57.739 --> 01:13:00.776
grab a bite to eat in here,
if that's okay.

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.679
492!

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.217
Sure you don't want anything?

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:12.453
- We're good.
- Okay.

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:14.020
It's always so embarrassing

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.224
to eat in front of people
you don't really know.

01:13:16.226 --> 01:13:19.025
It's even worse when you're
the only one eating.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.763
We just ate, but thanks.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.968
So, the show was,
like, super fun.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:30.971
It was more like an event
than a show.

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:34.941
It was in, um,
an abandoned subway station.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.147
Sure you don't want
to come check it out?

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.848
Another time.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:44.252
I mean, this city has
a lot of secrets.

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:46.655
Subterranean levels.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.191
Go ahead, just take some.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:51.660
As many as you want.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.131
Where you from exactly?

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.133
Pennsylvania.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:00.969
Northumberland County.

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:04.205
Sounds exciting.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:06.806
What do you like to do there?

01:14:06.808 --> 01:14:08.309
Normal things.

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:10.076
Like?

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.846
School, work.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:15.684
Sounds like
a fascinating place.

01:14:16.818 --> 01:14:18.954
Yeah, it's-it's nice.

01:14:22.824 --> 01:14:25.727
Sure you don't want to come
with me downtown?

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.964
W-We really can't.

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:32.868
Okay.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.131
Are there any lanes open?

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.167
- We can squeeze you in. Yeah.
- Perfect.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:08.169
- Uh, how many players today?
- Three.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:10.338
It's $90.47,
including tax and shoes.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.774
- I got it.
- Thanks.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.294
Oh! Jesus Christ.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.877
Wow.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.879
You're starting out killing it.

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.183
You hustling me?

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:08.028
Hey.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.299
You good?

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:15.136
Should I order
a pitcher of beer?

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:17.340
Just water will be fine.

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:20.343
Will you drink with me?

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:31.077
Hello?

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:33.414
Autumn?

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.282
Mom?

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.551
Are you okay?

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:41.056
Where are you?

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.930

What time is your bus?

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.143
I'm sorry, this is
really awkward, but, um,

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.178
can we ask you something?

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.747
Yeah, sure.

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:58.619
We lost our bus tickets,
and it got super late,

01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.188
and we don't have
anyone to call.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.623
Could we...

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:05.159
borrow a few bucks?

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.260
- Sorry.
- Sure.

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:07.394
No, no problem.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:08.762
I mean, yeah. Sure.

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:10.397
Thank you.

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:11.932
Just, uh...

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:13.634
just come with me downtown,

01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:16.672
and we can stop
at an ATM on the way.

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.640
I w-wish we could.

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:21.575
Sounds great, but...

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:24.580
we're really just cutting it
too close with our bus.

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.385
Okay.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.321
Um...

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:37.391
I mean,
everything's closed, so...

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.259
Yeah.

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.662
I guess
we can find one outside.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.664
Okay. Yeah.

01:21:43.666 --> 01:21:45.733
And you're probably tired
of lugging that thing around.

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:47.267
- It's fine.
- We'll just... we'll run out

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.569
and be right back.
We'll be quick.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.673
- It's-it's...
- Um...

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.443
Okay.

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:57.244
- Okay.
- Come.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.681
Okay.

01:25:36.899 --> 01:25:38.901
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:47.040
Um, we'll get you back.

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.710
No worries.

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.712
I'll, uh...

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:53.782
- I'll text you.
- Yeah.

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:03.626
Bye.

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.552
Want to see a trick?

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.688
Sure.

01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:09.692
Look at this, okay?

01:27:43.692 --> 01:27:45.159
How are you doing?

01:27:45.161 --> 01:27:46.927
I'm okay.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:50.065
Any pain, cramping,
bleeding overnight?

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.167
Nothing too bad.

01:27:53.169 --> 01:27:54.868
Okay, good.

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:56.903
And anything to eat or drink
since midnight?

01:27:56.905 --> 01:27:58.105
No.

01:27:58.107 --> 01:27:59.973
Okay.
You must be hungry, right?

01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:01.342
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:03.744
You can eat
as soon as you're done.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:05.779
- Great.
- Okay.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.648
I also want to make a
follow-up appointment for you.

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.684
Oh, um, do I have to come back?

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:12.652
No, you don't have to
come back here.

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.054
I know you live far away.

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:16.357
But I would like to help you
make an appointment

01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:18.658
somewhere closer to home.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.826
Okay?

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.728
Yeah, sure.

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:23.897
Okay.

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:25.634
You ready?

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:29.803
I think so. Yeah.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.738
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

01:28:59.235 --> 01:29:01.701
Can you tell me
your name, birth date

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:03.639
and what procedure
you're having?

01:29:06.242 --> 01:29:09.843
Um, my name is Autumn Callahan.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.946
August 19, 2002.

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:15.617
And what did you just ask me?

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.720
What procedure are you having?

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:23.157
Uh, I'm having an abortion.

01:29:23.159 --> 01:29:25.859
Do you have any questions
before we start?

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:27.928
No.

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:30.200
Are you ready to go to sleep?

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:29.658
Thanks.

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:47.075
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:51.214 --> 01:30:53.216
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.220
So, should we go?

01:30:58.221 --> 01:31:00.022
Mm-hmm.

01:31:42.198 --> 01:31:43.966
So, how was it?

01:31:46.269 --> 01:31:48.003
What do you mean?

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.106
Like, what was it like?

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:55.110
It was kind of whatever.

01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:59.182
Were they nice?

01:32:02.151 --> 01:32:04.019
Nice enough.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:10.159
Did it hurt?

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.762
Just uncomfortable.

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.068
How do you feel now?

01:32:22.438 --> 01:32:24.307
Tired.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:36.352
Want to try this?

01:32:37.853 --> 01:32:39.353
It's like a bug.

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:43.126
- Yeah, roly-poly.
- Yeah.

01:32:46.296 --> 01:32:48.997
A delicious one.

01:32:51.334 --> 01:32:53.367
And probably bad
for your health.

01:32:53.369 --> 01:32:55.935
Oh, yeah,
so it's good for the soul.

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:58.639
It's kind of all that grease,
you know.

01:32:58.641 --> 01:33:00.907
