Yeah! The jungle here
is full of awesome stuff.

01:46.207 --> 01:50.008
Like this green vine
would make a great swing.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.043
Wait! Marshall,

01:51.045 --> 01:54.246

I can't believe she took off

with my Pup Pad.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.901
This is a job
for the PAW Patrol!

No job is too big,
no pup is too small!

02:52.206 --> 02:54.673

03:44.425 --> 03:46.491
You all know Mandy
took my Pup Pad.

03:46.493 --> 03:49.094
The tracking device
shows where Mandy is.

03:49.096 --> 03:52.130
Right now, it looks like she's
heading out of the jungle

03:52.132 --> 03:53.165
and up into the hills.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.935
Uh-oh! That's where
the ancient ruins are.

03:56.937 --> 03:57.869
They're cursed!

03:57.871 --> 04:01.139
Cool! Wait, are there
spiders in there?

Mandy from the air.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.063
<i> Mandy, bring my Pup Pad</i>

04:25.065 --> 04:26.398

Nice talking to you too.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.403

04:33.040 --> 04:35.173
and your Super Spy
Infrared Goggles

04:35.175 --> 04:37.476
to track Mandy
around the ruins.

Cool! Super Spy
Chase is on the case.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.916
Carlos, what to come?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.018
Uh, I guess so,

04:46.020 --> 04:49.021
but I hope Mandy
doesn't go inside the ruins.

04:49.023 --> 04:53.492

go in, you'll never get out.

No! Mandy!

But a big boulder fell
and is blocking the door!

08:49.429 --> 08:50.562
I'm going to need help.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.598

blocking the door.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.449
Ryder, Carlos and Chase
are trapped inside!

09:11.451 --> 09:14.352
I'll have to use my
jackhammer to break it up,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.454
then maybe they
can get through.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.290
(Crashing)
BOTH: Uh-oh...

09:18.292 --> 09:21.092
How are we going to get
the necklace back up there?

09:21.094 --> 09:23.628
It's time for
Super Spy Chase.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.147
Missed her.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.584
(Barking)
Light!

09:48.989 --> 09:52.490
She dropped the necklace.
Now's our chance.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.072
There!

10:07.074 --> 10:09.441
I think it worked!

10:09.443 --> 10:11.509
We did it!
(Howling)

10:11.511 --> 10:14.312
Now, let's get out of here.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.119
(Barking)
Jackhammer.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.588
(Barking)
Shovel.

10:26.593 --> 10:31.129
Ryder, Rubble cleared the
boulders away from the door.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.165
<i> See if it can</i>
<i> slide open now.</i>

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
(Straining)

10:36.169 --> 10:36.768
It's too heavy.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.505
There must be some
other way to open the door.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.774
(Chattering)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.077
(Chattering)

10:46.713 --> 10:48.146
(Barking happily)

10:48.148 --> 10:49.280
BOTH:
You did it!

10:49.282 --> 10:54.486
RYDER:
Yup, with a little help from
our mischievous little monkey.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.687
ALL:
Bye, Mandy!

10:55.689 --> 10:56.721
See ya!
See ya!

10:56.723 --> 10:58.156
Thanks for
getting us out, Pups.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.226
I knew all I'd have
to do is yelp for help.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.595
(All laughing)

11:06.733 --> 11:09.134
(Gasping)

11:09.136 --> 11:11.403
(Giggling)

11:13.807 --> 11:15.573
(Chattering)

11:15.575 --> 11:18.677
Hey, my cell phone!

11:19.513 --> 11:22.647
Not again! Mandy!

11:22.649 --> 11:24.749
(Phone ringing)

11:24.751 --> 11:26.785
Hello. Ryder here.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.886
<i> (Chattering)</i>

11:27.888 --> 11:30.288
ALL:

11:30.290 --> 11:32.624
(Chattering)

11:33.460 --> 11:35.326
(Chattering)

11:35.328 --> 11:36.428
I got it!

11:36.430 --> 11:38.730
(Grunting)

11:42.102 --> 11:44.202
Told you I got it.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.504
(Laughing)

11:51.411 --> 11:55.447
ANNOUNCER:
<i> Don't miss the annual Sheep</i>
<i>Herder of the Year Competition!</i>

11:55.449 --> 11:58.316
<i> Last year's winner,</i>
<i> Silvia the Super Shepherd</i>

11:58.318 --> 12:01.853
<i> is the favorite to win the</i>
<i> blue ribbon again this year.</i>

12:01.855 --> 12:04.556
Oh, I'm so excited
you're competing

12:04.558 --> 12:06.691
for sheep header
of the year, Chase!

12:06.693 --> 12:07.492
(Gulping)

12:07.494 --> 12:09.060
Silvia's herding
looks pretty good.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.829
You're going to win for sure.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.565
You put the "herd"
in "Shepherd.

12:13.567 --> 12:17.202
Oh! Get it?
"Herd" in "Shepherd?"

12:17.204 --> 12:17.869
(Chuckling)

12:17.871 --> 12:20.972
If I'm going to win,
I need to practice.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.875
You see, "Herd"
is in the word "Shepherd."

12:23.877 --> 12:28.413
There must be something or
someone who needs herding.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.750
See you at the competition!

12:32.486 --> 12:35.920
Whoa!
Almost lost them there.

12:36.490 --> 12:39.891
(Gasping)
They need some herding help!

12:39.893 --> 12:41.292
(Barking)

12:41.294 --> 12:42.293
Huh?
Go left!

12:42.295 --> 12:43.094
No, go right!

12:43.096 --> 12:45.730
(Crashing)
(Gasping)

12:46.466 --> 12:47.699
(Splatting)

12:47.701 --> 12:48.867
Sorry, Mr. Porter.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.702
(Chuckling)
That's okay, Chase.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.704
You were trying to help.

12:52.706 --> 12:53.838
You did help!

12:53.840 --> 12:57.275
You herded the cake
into my mouth!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.511
Mmm...

13:02.415 --> 13:03.748
Six laughing gulls...

13:03.750 --> 13:04.716
(Squawking)

13:04.718 --> 13:05.750
(Gulls cawing)

13:05.752 --> 13:08.153
Captain Turbot
is counting seagulls.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.688
I'll help him by
herding them closer.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.524
(Barking, birds cawing)

13:12.526 --> 13:17.328
Oh! Eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve-- whoa!

13:17.330 --> 13:19.831
Sorry, Captain Turbot.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.634
I was just trying to herd
the seagulls for you.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.701
(Chuckling, cawing)

13:23.703 --> 13:26.704
You got this gull
to gather on my gourd.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.574
Oh, thirteen laughing gulls.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.475
(Cawing)

13:30.477 --> 13:33.511
(Whimpering)

13:34.514 --> 13:36.748
(Squeaking)

13:36.750 --> 13:38.550
Whoops!
(Barking)

13:38.552 --> 13:39.584
Whoa!

13:39.586 --> 13:40.852
(Gasping)

13:40.854 --> 13:42.587
No!

13:42.589 --> 13:43.655
(Barking)

13:43.657 --> 13:45.657
Whoa!

13:45.659 --> 13:46.758
(Sighing)

13:46.760 --> 13:47.692
Sorry, Rocky.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.127
It's not your
fault, Marshall.

13:49.129 --> 13:53.131
It's mine. I can't
even herd tennis balls.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.100
Nobody can herd
tennis balls, Chase.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.136
They're just tennis balls.

13:58.138 --> 13:58.870
(Sighing)

13:58.872 --> 14:01.673
I'll never win Shepherd
of the Year Award.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.007
BOTH:
Uh-oh...

14:03.009 --> 14:04.309
Ryder, Ryder!

14:04.311 --> 14:05.510
Chase needs help!

14:05.512 --> 14:06.878
He can't even
herd tennis balls.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.447
It sounds like Chase
has lost his confidence.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.115
(Phone ringing)

14:11.117 --> 14:12.417
(Beeping)

14:12.419 --> 14:13.151
Hi, Farmer Al.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.855
Howdy, Ryder. Afraid
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.689
What's wrong?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.824
<i> My fence broke and</i>
<i> the sheep I was taking</i>

14:19.826 --> 14:22.493
<i> to the herding</i>
<i> competition ran away.</i>

14:22.495 --> 14:23.695
Don't worry, Farmer Al.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.464
No job is too big,
no pup is too small!

14:26.466 --> 14:27.532
(Beeping)

14:27.534 --> 14:28.533
This is perfect!

14:28.535 --> 14:31.402
Farmer Al needs help
fixing his fence

14:31.404 --> 14:32.837
and herding his sheep,

14:32.839 --> 14:36.741
which is exactly what
Chase needs to practice!

14:36.743 --> 14:37.742
(Beeping)

14:37.744 --> 14:38.543
PAW Patrol...

14:38.545 --> 14:40.445
(Beeping)
... to the Lookout!

14:40.447 --> 14:42.146
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

14:42.148 --> 14:43.648
(Barking)

14:43.650 --> 14:45.850
(All barking)

14:45.852 --> 14:47.518
I got this!

14:47.520 --> 14:50.121
In line, single file.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.691
Hey, Chase,
good pup herding.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.126
Yeah, totally!

14:55.128 --> 14:56.661
Whoa!

14:56.663 --> 14:59.063
Whoa-oh-whoa!

14:59.065 --> 15:02.634
I can't even
herd the PAW Patrol.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.770
It's okay, Chase.
You've got most of us.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.439
MARSHALL:
Whoa!

15:10.810 --> 15:14.712
You must have "heard"
I like skateboarding.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.714
(All laughing)

15:25.525 --> 15:28.493
(Bell ringing)

15:30.830 --> 15:34.666
PAW Patrol ready for
action, Ryder, sir!

15:34.668 --> 15:35.199
(Beeping)

15:35.201 --> 15:37.802
Thanks for coming
so quickly, pups.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.170
Farmer Al needs our help.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.640
His fence is busted and
all the sheep ran away.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.209
He's going to need
some expert herding help.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.813
Herding?
Pick me! Pick me!

15:48.815 --> 15:50.081
(Beeping)

15:50.083 --> 15:51.049
Rocky--
What?!

15:51.051 --> 15:54.686
I'll need your tool arc
to help repair the fence.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.587
Green means go!

15:56.589 --> 15:59.824
Hmm... let's see, who else?

15:59.826 --> 16:01.993
Pick me! Pick me!

16:01.995 --> 16:03.561
(Beeping)

16:03.563 --> 16:04.662
Chase--

16:04.664 --> 16:05.129
Yes!

16:05.131 --> 16:06.531
I'll need your megaphone,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.199
net and excellent herding skills

16:08.201 --> 16:10.034
to help round up all the sheep.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.036
Chase is on the case!

16:12.038 --> 16:15.573
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

16:15.575 --> 16:17.241

17:23.977 --> 17:25.676
Ryder, thanks for hustling over.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.012
My sheep have
scattered everywhere.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.047
See?
Whoa!

17:29.049 --> 17:30.748
Whoops.
(Chuckling)

17:30.750 --> 17:32.116
Better put this down.

17:32.118 --> 17:32.850
(Bleating)

17:32.852 --> 17:35.286
No "Baaa-ck talk" Marley.
(Sighing)

17:35.288 --> 17:37.321
Okay, Chase,
you get to Herding.

17:37.323 --> 17:40.691
Rocky and I will help
Farmer Al with the fence.

17:40.693 --> 17:44.629
Chase is on the case!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.898
(Barking)

17:48.101 --> 17:50.301
(Barking)
Perfect!

17:50.303 --> 17:54.272

17:54.274 --> 17:56.107
(Barking, bleating)

17:56.109 --> 17:58.943
This will be easy.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.879
We'll have this fence
fixed in no time.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.147
Thanks, Ryder.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.382
Rocky...

18:04.384 --> 18:07.118
(Barking)
Screwdriver.

Nice work, Rocky.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.352
Thanks.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.386
It's getting late.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.387
We've got to finish this up

18:43.389 --> 18:45.156
and get to
the herding competition.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.692
(Panting)
I got four in the trailer.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.660
How many more
sheep are out there?

18:49.662 --> 18:52.230
Five more to go,
including Marley.

18:53.166 --> 18:57.034
Chase, there's one over by
the barn. Can you go get it?

18:57.036 --> 19:00.838
Chase is on that
sheep's case.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.240
(Phone ringing)

19:02.242 --> 19:02.974
(Beeping)

19:02.976 --> 19:04.442
Hi, Mayor Goodway.
<i> Hi, Ryder.</i>

19:04.444 --> 19:07.011
Are you and chase
on your way to the competition?

19:07.013 --> 19:08.980
Not yet.
Farmer Al's sheep escaped

19:08.982 --> 19:10.181
and we're trying
to herd them all.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.150
Farmer Al lost the
sheep for the competition

19:12.152 --> 19:13.451
and doesn't know
where to find them?

19:13.453 --> 19:18.222
(Gasping)
Oh, that's bad, really "baaad!"

19:18.224 --> 19:21.292
(Bleating, barking)

19:21.294 --> 19:23.261
(Barking)

19:23.263 --> 19:25.897
(Bleating)

19:27.367 --> 19:30.168
That is one dizzy sheep.
(Barking)

19:30.170 --> 19:31.869
(Barking)
(Bleating)

19:31.871 --> 19:35.106
There are two more
around here somewhere.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.207
A-ha!

19:36.209 --> 19:37.408
(Beeping)

19:37.410 --> 19:38.442
(Beeping)

19:38.444 --> 19:41.078
RYDER:
<i> There's two near</i>
<i> the silo, Chase.</i>

19:41.080 --> 19:43.347
(Barking)

19:44.951 --> 19:47.185

19:47.187 --> 19:49.353

19:53.993 --> 19:56.160
Uh-oh!
(Barking)

19:56.162 --> 19:58.930
Net!

20:02.468 --> 20:03.367
Phew!

20:03.369 --> 20:06.070
Three down, two to go.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.344
(Barking)

20:14.447 --> 20:15.379
Now, Ryder!

20:15.381 --> 20:17.848
Great herding, Chase.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.251
Guess that just leaves Marley.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.453
Marley?
(Bleating)

20:22.455 --> 20:24.989
(Bleating)

20:24.991 --> 20:26.224
(Barking)

20:26.226 --> 20:28.392
(Barking)

20:28.394 --> 20:33.831
(Barking)

20:37.136 --> 20:39.937
(Panting)
Now, where'd he go?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.205
(Bleating)
Whoa!

20:41.207 --> 20:43.107
(Growling)

20:43.109 --> 20:45.042
(Barking)

20:45.044 --> 20:49.880
(Clattering,
animal noises sounding)

20:50.383 --> 20:52.116
(Clucking)

20:52.118 --> 20:53.117
How's it going, Chase?

20:53.119 --> 20:56.287
Having some
trouble with Marley?

20:56.289 --> 20:57.054
Kind of.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.090
(Chuckling)
Oh, he's a feisty one.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.560
I'm the only one who can
herd him and it's tough at that.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.228
I'll get him, Chase.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.529
If I can't herd Marley,

21:05.531 --> 21:09.433
how am I ever going
to win the competition?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.801
(Bleating)

21:10.803 --> 21:13.104
(Bleating)

21:15.475 --> 21:16.307
(Nickering)

21:16.309 --> 21:19.310
Let's get going to
the herding competition.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.280
My old truck is so slow,
we'll never make it on time.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.383
I know someone who has
a really fast police truck.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.517
Huh?

21:26.519 --> 21:28.552
You can get us
there fast, Chase.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.789
You got it, Ryder!
(Barking)

21:32.759 --> 21:34.492
(Siren sounding)

21:34.494 --> 21:36.027
Yee-haw!

21:36.029 --> 21:39.830
ANNOUNCER:
<i> And Chase really has</i>
<i> these sheep on the run.</i>

21:39.832 --> 21:40.865
<i> (Barking)</i>

21:40.867 --> 21:41.932
The trick is herding Marley.

21:41.934 --> 21:45.169
If he can herd him,
I know Chase can win.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.971
<i> And a fine job</i>
<i> herding by Chase.</i>

21:46.973 --> 21:47.972
<i> Just one sheep left</i>

21:47.974 --> 21:50.474
<i> and only a few seconds</i>
<i> till his time is up.</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:52.977
(Gulping)

21:52.979 --> 21:55.379
(Bleating)

21:55.381 --> 21:57.615
You can do it, Chase!

21:57.617 --> 22:00.484
(Barking)

22:00.486 --> 22:05.022
(Barking)

22:09.662 --> 22:12.363
(Cheering)
(Barking)

22:13.399 --> 22:14.498
<i> Chase wins!</i>

22:14.500 --> 22:15.433
(Nickering)

22:15.435 --> 22:17.468
Yes, he did it!
Yay!

22:17.470 --> 22:19.270
(Cheering)
Woo-hoo, go, Chase!

22:19.272 --> 22:22.373
ROCKY:
Way to go, Chase!

22:22.375 --> 22:24.542
(Barking)

22:24.544 --> 22:26.043
(All bleating)

22:26.045 --> 22:29.513
(Barking, bleating)

22:29.515 --> 22:31.849
Can I herd this time?

22:31.851 --> 22:32.850
Sure.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.952
(Bleating)

22:34.954 --> 22:36.487
(Barking)

22:36.489 --> 22:37.955
Whoa!

22:37.957 --> 22:39.890
¶ You're all good pups ¶

22:39.892 --> 22:41.258
¶ And you saved the day ¶

22:41.260 --> 22:44.061
You're all such "goood" pups.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.364
(Laughing)

22:50.336 --> 23:05.182
¶
