WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.837
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.214
<i>What is that?
A fire crackling?</i>

00:06.214 --> 00:08.633
Yeah. Lobby bar. It's homey.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.927
- All of you are gonna get one.
- This'll track your sleep,

00:10.927 --> 00:12.929
your resting heart rate,
and other vitals

00:12.929 --> 00:15.390
in the name of well-being
and productivity.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.641
You wear it 24/7.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.976
FBI!

00:17.976 --> 00:18.893
Spread out!

00:18.893 --> 00:21.438
Dr. Gilbert,
my name is Chuck Rhoades.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.732
- You know I'm innocent.
- Innocent?

00:23.732 --> 00:26.109
No, I cannot credit
that assertion.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.737
We'll make a dang fortune.
And this is the kind of idea

00:28.737 --> 00:31.406
custom-made to campaign on.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.074
He's one of the heads
of the firm.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.493
Young guy named
Philip Charyn finds himself

00:35.493 --> 00:37.162
on the opposite side of Prince.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.496
Sounds Byzantine.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.665
<i>It seemed to me
that he was asking me</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:42.042
<i>to bring you
in on the situation.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.711
- Do I need to call a lawyer?
- You sent for me.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.546
You didn't tape an "X"
to a telephone pole,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.673
but you asked for a meet
just the same.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.799
<i>I love
that you're ditching</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:51.134
<i>your race for Congress.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:53.595
You should go long, Purell.
I'm not ditching a thing.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.888
But you're still here?

00:54.888 --> 00:58.224
Most important actions
a president can take

00:58.224 --> 00:59.434
are those that assure

00:59.434 --> 01:01.561
that no nuclear weapon
is ever fired.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.646
If a hostile nation state
were going to initiate,

01:03.646 --> 01:05.315
I would be open
to launching first

01:05.315 --> 01:06.566
in order to shut them down.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.943
Even if it may mean the end
of the world as we know it.

01:08.943 --> 01:12.655
People without self-doubt
should never put themselves

01:12.655 --> 01:14.449
in a position of complete power.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.867
They're the only ones
who should rule,

01:15.867 --> 01:18.286
because the other people
let self-doubt rule them.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.954
That would never be me.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.729
<i>Now we take our time</i>

01:44.729 --> 01:47.899
<i>So nonchalant</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:50.860
<i>And spend our nights</i>

01:50.860 --> 01:53.947
<i>So bon vivant</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:57.742
<i>We dress our days</i>

01:57.742 --> 01:59.828
<i>In silken robes</i>

02:00.745 --> 02:03.248
<i>The money comes</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:06.876
<i>The money goes</i>

02:06.876 --> 02:09.754
<i>We know it's all</i>

02:09.754 --> 02:14.467
<i>A passing phase</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:21.933
<i>We light our lamps</i>

02:21.933 --> 02:25.311
<i>For atmosphere</i>

02:25.311 --> 02:28.231
<i>And hang our hopes</i>

02:28.231 --> 02:31.609
<i>On chandeliers</i>

02:31.609 --> 02:34.737
<i>We're going long</i>

02:34.737 --> 02:37.365
<i>We're gaining weight</i>

02:37.365 --> 02:40.034
<i>We're sleeping long</i>

02:40.034 --> 02:42.787
Hope you enjoy.
Take your time.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.831
Thank you, Sal.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.921
Counselor, you've been
eyeing me all night.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.549
You're the only other person
in the establishment.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.967
Not sure where else
I might look.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.719
I didn't say
you were looking at me.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.971
I said you were eyeing me.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.681
Of course you're looking.
We're talking.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.809
But, uh, your eyes
keep searching my face,

03:04.809 --> 03:06.102
trying to find an answer.

03:06.102 --> 03:09.272
Only thing is, you're
dancing around the question.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.481
Oh!

03:10.481 --> 03:11.900
Once a cop, huh?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.276
Even in retirement.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.863
Not observant 'cause I was
an officer of the law.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.157
Reason I was an effective
officer of the law,

03:19.157 --> 03:21.075
reason I rose
in the ranks as I did,

03:21.075 --> 03:24.746
that's because, to start,
I had the power of observation,

03:24.746 --> 03:27.707
which, you want to know
what that really is?

03:27.707 --> 03:30.335
I suspect I'm gonna hear
your perspective on it.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.503
So, yeah, sure.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.631
It's the refusal
to look away.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.633
We all want to,

03:36.633 --> 03:37.967
especially when
we glimpse something

03:37.967 --> 03:39.594
we'd prefer not to see,

03:39.594 --> 03:41.638
or we notice something
we'd rather not deal with.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.807
You know, guys know their wife
is stepping out on them

03:44.807 --> 03:47.894
months, years before
they bring themselves

03:47.894 --> 03:49.437
to accept that knowledge.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.899
Same way an investor has that
sneaky feeling in his stomach

03:52.899 --> 03:54.734
that his money guy
is lying to him.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.653
But he writes it off to the last
veal parm he had for lunch...

03:56.653 --> 03:58.738
And you think
you've noticed something

03:58.738 --> 04:02.242
in how my eyes
are alighting on your face?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.618
If you stall much longer,

04:03.618 --> 04:05.870
we're gonna have to ask them
to open for breakfast.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.580
And they didn't even
do that for Sinatra

04:07.580 --> 04:09.415
when he was sitting back
over there

04:09.415 --> 04:10.875
in the sanctified seats.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.294
Well, I'm sure they would have,
if he'd asked.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.840
Chuck, we've supped.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.842
We've libated.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.928
Now's the time.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.391
Now is the time, huh?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.476
Okay, okay.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.688
Now is the time.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.440
Just out with it, Rhoades.

04:36.901 --> 04:41.447
The practice of making sure
a guilty man goes down,

04:41.447 --> 04:45.159
whether the evidence exists
or needs to be helped along,

04:45.159 --> 04:47.662
when no doubt exists
in the minds

04:47.662 --> 04:52.083
of the arresting officers,
their peers, et cetera.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.004
It used to happen sometimes.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.423
Still does, I'm sure.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.634
Guy would stick a bag of dope
in a wife-beater's car.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.052
That kind of thing.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.763
Because you knew the world
would be better with him gone.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.016
Yeah, but...

05:08.016 --> 05:10.893
it never works the way
the cop thinks it will,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.395
flaking a guy.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.813
Not really.

05:13.813 --> 05:18.443
Somewhere between the idea and
the execution, things go wrong.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.030
You gotta have the evidence
of guilt of the actual crime,

05:22.030 --> 05:24.824
not the crime
you think he might commit

05:24.824 --> 05:26.159
or also committed.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.494
The one
you're arresting him for.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.704
Or else?

05:29.704 --> 05:31.497
<i>Anima in periculo.</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:32.874
Oh!

05:32.874 --> 05:35.126
You remember some of the Latin
the nuns gave you.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.962
That brings a smile.
But if I wanted to ensure

05:37.962 --> 05:39.339
my soul would never be in peril,

05:39.339 --> 05:42.467
I'd have become, I don't know,
a veterinarian.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.094
Yeah.

05:45.094 --> 05:48.222
But still, this is different.

05:48.222 --> 05:52.143
What it does to a person's
insides to frame someone.

05:52.143 --> 05:57.190
And that's still not why it's
on my "do not recommend" list.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.859
The problem is,

05:59.859 --> 06:02.945
the system collapses
under its own weight.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.406
Not right away. Soon enough.

06:05.406 --> 06:09.911
Those lines on the road to
justice exist to serve everyone.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.788
They should not
be traipsed over.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.416
But what if the guy
isn't only guilty,

06:15.416 --> 06:20.671
but a continuing
and enormous danger to society?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.217
To the world?

06:24.217 --> 06:29.097
So it is some kind of permission
you're after, not guidance.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.725
I can't grant it.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.976
I won't.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.814
Bad for you.
Bad for the whole deal.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.399
You want absolution in advance,

06:39.399 --> 06:42.610
take it up with a commissioner
of a different department.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.956
Why can't you
get this guy

06:54.956 --> 06:57.250
under the legitimate weight
of your own office?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.336
Because this guy can't be got
with normal methods.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.088
He's a king.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.632
But a mad king.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.427
Now you said something.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.763
Old days, when a king
was confirmed mad,

07:10.763 --> 07:14.892
that's when his own court
was ready to depose him.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.436
Help depose him.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.396
They usually ended up
without heads for their trouble.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.150
Well, if they were in the court,
they probably had it coming.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.153
Find them.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.281
Use their own outrage
against him.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.869
I happen to care
about at least one

07:32.869 --> 07:35.830
of these particular courtiers.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.299
Then there's only
one thing to do.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.843
Drink, my friend.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.918
I was sitting there at my desk,

08:21.918 --> 08:24.295
waiting for everyone else
but you to leave.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.673
And I sat there
for another hour...

08:27.673 --> 08:29.383
deciding.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.556
I think there's a mutiny
in the works.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.891
Evidence?

08:36.891 --> 08:39.810
Circumstantial
but strongly suggestive.

08:42.980 --> 08:46.567
I was doing my usual
post-decision review process--

08:46.567 --> 08:47.777
You do that? How often?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.237
Once a week,
so I don't get sloppy.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.948
And whilst reviewing,
something came clear.

08:51.948 --> 08:56.327
The moment I went to tell Prince
I was leaving the firm.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.829
The idea to do that,
to leave,

08:58.829 --> 09:00.581
wasn't really mine.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.959
Who whispered it, then?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.377
Wags put it in my head,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.796
and I don't think it was out
of the goodness of his heart.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.339
You think he wanted
to get rid of you?

09:08.339 --> 09:11.676
He came on like he was
looking out for me.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.927
He doesn't do that.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.221
And that insight made me
rethink something else.

09:15.221 --> 09:19.016
A few times, when I've
approached small groups,

09:19.016 --> 09:23.896
they changed the conversation
or stopped talking entirely.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.358
Should we wake Prince?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.402
Not yet. No.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.154
When did this happen?
Who are the groups?

09:32.154 --> 09:35.449
I took contemporaneous notes. Here.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.454
Let's pull it up.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.623
- Pull it up?
- Yeah.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.668
As old Warner Wolf used to say,
"Let's go to the videotape."

09:45.668 --> 09:49.505
We record everything
except privileged conversations.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.592
You record those too,
don't you?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.720
Don't we? Come on.

10:11.027 --> 10:16.240
I have been walking and thinking
about this all night.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.826
After the eating and drinking,
I mean.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.494
Hmm. I inferred that part.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.372
The kids are sleeping,
so let's keep it quiet-ish.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.626
Easy. Not that kind of drunk.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.085
Ah.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.630
The inquisitive kind.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Okay.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.842
Come on.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.020
Fire away.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.776
How do you convince somebody
you won't hurt them

10:51.776 --> 10:54.362
if you really mean it?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.072
Do you need me to play along

10:56.072 --> 10:58.157
like I think you're asking theoretically,

10:58.157 --> 11:00.910
or about some random person
I don't know?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.703
I do not, no.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.501
I have been ruminating
about what caused you

11:08.501 --> 11:12.380
to send your charge
Philip to me.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.549
Sent him because he asked.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.885
Do you need me to play along

11:17.885 --> 11:19.512
like that's true?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.222
I do not.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.474
No.

11:23.474 --> 11:28.479
But I do need a reason
to keep this going.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.609
The Philip thing
made me fairly certain

11:33.609 --> 11:37.405
that you see Prince
the way I do.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.825
Before I respond to that...

11:41.742 --> 11:44.078
I need to know.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.914
What do you see in him
that's different

11:46.914 --> 11:50.000
than what you see
in any other target?

11:51.168 --> 11:54.547
Well, the self-interest
is the same.

11:54.547 --> 12:00.136
The scope and scale
of the ambition is not.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.722
Nor the grandiosity of vision.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.935
Sure, others of his general
stature bilk society

12:07.935 --> 12:09.687
while padding
their own pockets,

12:09.687 --> 12:13.441
but not a one of them
that I have personally chased

12:13.441 --> 12:16.777
had the desire or capability
to get to where his hand

12:16.777 --> 12:22.450
was on the nuclear button
so he could press it first.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.246
Yeah, well...

12:27.246 --> 12:30.374
Yes, this guy would,
or could, at least.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.460
"Could" is unacceptable.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.755
What if I agreed with that?

12:36.338 --> 12:37.923
What then?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.803
I am back at my reason
for the visit.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.934
How do I convince you it would
be safe for you to work with me?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.688
In what way?

12:52.688 --> 12:56.984
I can't find a path
to get him within what I do.

12:56.984 --> 13:01.238
But with someone on the inside,
the path would reveal itself.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.574
If not to bring him to justice,

13:03.574 --> 13:06.452
at least to stop his ascent.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.459
As you know, somewhere deep...

13:14.293 --> 13:20.049
that I would stop short of
causing you irreparable harm...

13:20.049 --> 13:25.763
at this point, I, too, am close
to feeling that in the reverse.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.806
Jesus, it's late.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.016
I sound like
I'm in a Tennessee Williams.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.270
But it doesn't matter
what I feel

13:33.270 --> 13:35.105
about how you'd treat me.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.398
Not really.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.776
What matters is,
for what you want to try,

13:38.776 --> 13:41.487
for it to have
any chance of succeeding,

13:41.487 --> 13:43.989
I'd have to enlist
other people.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.283
I have enlisted other people.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.453
But I can't vouch for you
to them,

13:49.453 --> 13:52.373
because you would hurt them
if you had to

13:52.373 --> 13:55.000
without more
than a moment's thought.

13:58.712 --> 14:02.174
Well, at least you grant me
that I would take that moment.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.594
I can see that you've grown.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.848
But it doesn't change
the finality of my position.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.308
I can't vouch.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.811
And even if I did,
they wouldn't believe me.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.229
Not after...

14:17.064 --> 14:19.525
everything they've seen you do.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.698
Thanks for answering the door.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.172
I've also felt the kind
of misalignment you describe,

14:42.172 --> 14:43.549
but not from Wags.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.760
Let's just see
what was going on.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.809
<i>...zooming up
the fucking polls...</i>

14:55.769 --> 14:59.023
<i>...there is a potential
equal time issue.</i>

15:00.357 --> 15:02.443
<i>We definitely
need her out of here.</i>

15:02.443 --> 15:05.070
<i>...running for Congress.</i>

15:05.070 --> 15:07.114
<i>And duty for Prince?</i>

15:07.114 --> 15:08.365
<i>The hazards of staying.</i>

15:08.365 --> 15:10.534
So the cameras
are pointed away

15:10.534 --> 15:12.036
from the PMs
at their desk,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.245
away from the Bloombergs.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.914
There are zones of safety,
and with that,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.206
this is mostly legal.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.541
You take over
your enemy's company,

15:17.541 --> 15:19.668
you put in
appropriate measures

15:19.668 --> 15:21.670
without exposing Prince unnecessarily.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.089
I heard some talk about you
giving out tracker rings

15:24.089 --> 15:25.341
before I got here.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.508
Decoys?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.302
We assumed people
would figure it out.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.013
And stop looking
for anything else.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.681
Devious. In a good way.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.309
If you had all this stuff
recorded, why didn't you know?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.186
It's like the NSA
under the Patriot Act,

15:37.186 --> 15:38.604
pulling down
all communications.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.481
When you record everything,
you can't review.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.317
So you wait until
circumstance dictates.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.527
Then look for keywords
and trust it's all there.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.197
I'll have this sent out
and have the sound cleaned up.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.532
But I can tell
by body language

15:50.532 --> 15:52.451
they weren't talking
about the Knicks.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.829
It was after that conversation
in the elevator

15:55.829 --> 15:58.499
that he broached the idea
of me leaving.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.292
You know,
for my benefit.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.794
I don't want to dignify
the colloquial,

16:01.794 --> 16:04.380
but "suss"
does feel appropriate.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.174
We should fire them all,
for starters.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.342
Maybe.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.969
Look at this.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.514
I had hoped the sixth sense
was wrong.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.641
This was taken when they were
in England together,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.851
reportedly in the hotel.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.894
Shit.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.522
I hired an expert
on English architecture

16:21.522 --> 16:22.982
and antiquities weeks ago.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
Still waiting
for some kind of verification.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.736
We will move quickly and
decisively when we know more,

16:27.736 --> 16:29.488
but we need
the rest of it first.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.657
So, we're not waking him.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.785
Not tonight. But soon.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
You're thinking
about all the things

16:40.541 --> 16:42.251
we can see
with these cameras.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.752
Don't do that.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.295
Pretend you don't know.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.589
The other way
is a path to despair.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.174
Just tell me
the bathrooms aren't--

16:49.174 --> 16:50.676
It was a discussion,
but no.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.344
That was a bridge too far.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.304
Yeah.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.144
I want out.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.687
Out?

17:02.813 --> 17:05.274
I wish I could just bail
on all of it.

17:05.274 --> 17:08.360
I wish I could, I guess,
go backwards

17:08.360 --> 17:09.653
to before I knew so much,

17:09.653 --> 17:13.657
before there was
so much reason to be alarmed.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.452
The burden of what you know

17:16.452 --> 17:19.371
and what you believe
will happen...

17:19.371 --> 17:23.917
I can see why you'd
just want to erase it.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.919
Or, if not erase,
I could just leave.

17:25.919 --> 17:29.214
Absent myself
from the situation.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.382
From Prince Capital.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.760
Let it all fall
where it will,

17:32.760 --> 17:35.095
you know,
despite what I believe.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.056
What's prompting this?

17:37.681 --> 17:40.267
Today. Now.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.438
Chuck came to see me.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.857
Proposed joining sides.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.778
You and he?
Working together?

17:51.653 --> 17:52.696
On this?

17:52.696 --> 17:54.406
And he's right, tactically,

17:54.406 --> 17:57.076
if I could trust him
not to harm my people,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.952
and I... I almost do.

17:58.952 --> 18:03.457
I can see why this...
this interaction, this question,

18:03.457 --> 18:05.709
pushes you to make
your own plans

18:05.709 --> 18:07.628
to scale the wall
to freedom.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.130
But picture yourself,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.508
in whatever setting,

18:12.508 --> 18:15.094
seeing Prince ascend...

18:16.095 --> 18:18.138
whenever you turned on
the television

18:18.138 --> 18:20.349
or opened your browser.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.729
Seeing Chuck with that kind of
hopeless conviction on his face

18:25.729 --> 18:29.775
kind of convinced me that I
probably can't stop it anyway.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.611
So if I was some other place,
some other job,

18:32.611 --> 18:34.822
maybe helping people,
maybe lifting people up,

18:34.822 --> 18:37.533
perhaps I'd feel I was doing
some fucking thing.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.701
Then explore that path.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.953
Put the word out.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.706
Which probably means
just checking that folder

18:44.706 --> 18:46.708
you have in your inbox.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.711
The one that has all
the incoming from headhunters,

18:49.711 --> 18:51.922
hiring executives, CEOs.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.216
I have.
As soon as Chuck left,

18:54.216 --> 18:57.136
I opened that very folder...

18:58.637 --> 19:01.348
and saw a few things
worth considering.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.143
Then consider them.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.523
But also consider...

19:10.566 --> 19:12.985
that as you get closer

19:12.985 --> 19:17.698
to any moment
of huge import,

19:17.698 --> 19:21.201
huge impact,
huge challenge,

19:21.201 --> 19:26.498
the desire to flee
becomes almost overwhelming.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.585
Sometimes that instinct
serves us.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.547
And sometimes
it's trying to protect

19:33.547 --> 19:35.757
what doesn't need protecting

19:35.757 --> 19:39.845
and is, instead,
stopping us

19:39.845 --> 19:44.266
from taking
that very risk

19:44.266 --> 19:49.021
we absolutely need to take.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.822
You've been out
all morning.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.616
You rescheduled
a court appearance.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.825
You skipped the Chiefs' meeting.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.577
You have Allerd running
back and forth

20:03.577 --> 20:06.205
to the records room
for old case files all day.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.414
What are you doing?

20:07.414 --> 20:08.832
I had to reschedule
that hearing

20:08.832 --> 20:10.792
because I needed to be
at a different hearing.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.960
What hearing?

20:11.960 --> 20:15.964
A sentence-reduction hearing.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.758
I've had a hell of a morning.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.635
We are here
on the Government's Rule 35,

20:19.635 --> 20:21.261
motion to reduce
defendant's sentence

20:21.261 --> 20:23.639
for substantial assistance
to the government.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.599
How is the government
represented?

20:25.599 --> 20:26.808
Your Honor.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.936
No.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.856
Wait-- uh, no.
No. Absolutely not.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.275
This man is conflicted.
He-he's gonna try and screw me.

20:35.275 --> 20:39.488
Sir, the nature of this hearing
is to reduce your sentence.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.657
Due respect, Judge,
not with him.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.824
It is a trick.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.786
He visited me in prison
to harass me.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.371
- He's gonna try attack--
- Sir.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.622
Counselor,
calm your client.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.040
Trying, Your Honor.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.917
The defendant is highly
agitated. I-I'm inclined to--

20:51.917 --> 20:53.752
Your Honor, please.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.129
Not what I'm here for.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.217
I see there are visits by you.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.219
Does the defendant
have grounds for his claims?

21:02.219 --> 21:06.181
Your Honor, the defendant has
provided substantial assistance,

21:06.181 --> 21:08.308
as described
in the government's papers.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.102
He's here to mess
with me, I'm telling you.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.812
He's-- he's getting
my sentence reduced

21:11.812 --> 21:13.855
so that he-he can lock me up
for something else.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.190
You will sit quietly

21:15.190 --> 21:17.025
until the government states
its case, sir,

21:17.025 --> 21:20.112
or you will be sent
out of the room.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.824
Mr. Rhoades, I will give you
about two short sentences

21:23.824 --> 21:26.743
to establish the capacity
in which you're here.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.829
If I don't like it, you're out.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.581
And we will figure out who else
will represent the government.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.960
Despite Dr. Gilbert's
reasonable concerns

21:34.960 --> 21:36.795
about my intentions,

21:36.795 --> 21:41.883
I am here to argue
that his sentence be ended now.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.012
All final years lopped off.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.974
Dr. Gilbert has tended
to fellow inmates.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.601
He's helped guards
with their health care.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.480
Taught CPR and other first aid
in the facility.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.025
Saved lives.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.736
That is impressive.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.822
But that is really
what he's supposed to be doing.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.990
Rehabilitating.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.867
I don't see it
as grounds for reducing.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.869
Your Honor,
in the current climate,

22:08.869 --> 22:10.996
anyone who improves
the prison system,

22:10.996 --> 22:13.415
makes it more humane,
more functional,

22:13.415 --> 22:17.336
they are providing substantial
help to law enforcement.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.339
Now Dr. Gilbert has provided
useful information

22:20.339 --> 22:23.925
and proven himself
a valuable member of society,

22:23.925 --> 22:27.304
both inside the prison and out.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.902
Motion granted.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.780
And sentence is hereby reduced
to 26 months,

22:44.780 --> 22:46.281
which have been served.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.033
Defendant should be
processed out

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
by the Bureau of Prisons immediately.

22:50.202 --> 22:54.081
Would you like to return to your
cell to collect your belongings?

22:54.998 --> 22:59.252
I'm, uh, happy to never go back
if I don't have to.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.297
Clerk, see about getting
this man some street clothes.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.761
Enjoy dinner tonight
at home with your family.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.731
Dr. Gilbert, before you go,

23:19.731 --> 23:21.650
there's one thing I would
like do in return.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.111
You have no right
to ask anything of me.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.072
Not a goddamn thing.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.789
What the hell do you want?

23:37.290 --> 23:42.087
To give you the opportunity to
state exactly what I did to you.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.005
Give the full brace.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.799
Leave nothing out.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.388
I let the attorney general
convince me

23:51.388 --> 23:54.808
that breaking the law
was necessary

23:54.808 --> 23:56.601
to upholding the law.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.437
Rhoades hoped-- No.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.942
He knew that I would
receive the maximum sentence,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.652
and he got just that.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.070
<i>Planted evidence,</i>

24:07.070 --> 24:10.532
<i>and left me to rot behind bars
for his sins.</i>

24:10.532 --> 24:12.576
<i>Not my own.</i>

24:12.576 --> 24:15.370
<i>He betrayed me...</i>

24:15.370 --> 24:17.205
Okay, erase this insanity
right now.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.874
- No, sir.
- You got the man early release.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.375
How about having him
say that, at least?

24:20.375 --> 24:24.004
Not the drill on this one.
Needed the damning stuff.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.964
- It's insanity.
- Saying it twice

24:25.964 --> 24:27.507
doesn't make it so.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.717
It was so before I said...

24:28.717 --> 24:30.927
Chuck, man,

24:30.927 --> 24:33.180
this is not the time
to blow yourself up

24:33.180 --> 24:34.347
while making amends.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.224
Oh, it's always
the time for that.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.226
And it's a nice
side benefit of this,

24:38.226 --> 24:39.978
but that's not
what I'm doing here.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.022
I'll wait you out,
'cause the longer I do,

24:42.022 --> 24:44.774
the longer this all stays
right here in the room with us.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.776
If you stay, you're
kind of co-signing,

24:46.776 --> 24:48.320
uh, whatever he does.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.279
I'm not.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.865
Mr. Schirmer, did you try
to stop the defendant

24:51.865 --> 24:54.784
from committing
career hara-kiri?

24:54.784 --> 24:56.828
I'm not leaving.
I'm not letting it happen.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.164
Whatever the fuck it is.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.250
Little favor,
if you don't mind.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.545
A company asked me
to give a talk.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.964
Mental. Huh.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.090
Telehealth start-up.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.635
Even better,
tele-mental health.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.136
Online therapy.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.930
With the current microscope
on Prince,

25:14.930 --> 25:17.724
I want to make sure it's a place
I can be associated with.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.184
Non-toxic.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.436
Paid speaking gig. Nice.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.687
Cha-ching.

25:22.687 --> 25:23.897
It can be.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.982
If you could just
skim their financials,

25:25.982 --> 25:28.944
let me know they're solvent,
there are no red flags.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.153
That'd be good.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.822
<i>Eu entend.</i>

25:32.822 --> 25:34.533
That's Portuguese.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.039
You know,
instead of sitting there

25:41.039 --> 25:44.501
with that Amerigo Bonasera
undertaker look on your face,

25:44.501 --> 25:45.293
check the frame.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.795
Or, no, give me your phone.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.380
Maybe that's better.
Yours is newer.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.883
My phone is kind of permanently
in non-record mode these days.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.928
Probably best.
Okay, I'll use mine.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.227
I'm center frame?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.854
Can you just nod?
That doesn't make you complicit.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.857
Maybe fill me in
on the exact plan.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.985
See these files?

26:09.985 --> 26:14.990
These represent every case
wherein I cut a corner.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.284
The blind trust violation
of Ice Juice.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.495
Arranging voter suppression
to win my AG election.

26:20.495 --> 26:24.082
Remember Hap Halloran,
the municipal administrator?

26:24.082 --> 26:27.544
Bribed him by providing a second
honeymoon for his wife and him

26:27.544 --> 26:28.628
in Puerto Rico.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.507
Organized a heist,
pulled by Jackie Connerty.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.466
My God!

26:33.466 --> 26:36.595
Just hearing myself
say it out loud.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.887
Organized a heist.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.431
- A heist?
- Yes, sir.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.933
No, that was a fun one, actually.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.184
A real peach, it was.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.186
And it did someone a service.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.396
Leah Calder.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.064
We stole back the ring
her spoiled son gave

26:48.064 --> 26:49.649
- her almost daughter-in-law.
- You know, I-I-I--

26:49.649 --> 26:51.860
I don't really need to--
Actually, yeah, don't tell me.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.487
But it was wrong
and a dereliction of duty,

26:54.487 --> 26:56.448
and as such,
I have to catalog it

26:56.448 --> 26:58.867
and speak it into that
recorder right there.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.452
You don't.
You really don't.

27:00.452 --> 27:05.498
Assuming now these files are,
uh, your notes on all of your...

27:05.498 --> 27:07.709
I hesitate to call them
your illegal actions--

27:07.709 --> 27:09.002
Stop hesitating.

27:09.002 --> 27:13.006
These files represent
the wins only.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.634
The video will be
the full truth.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.760
The breadth of the thing.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.888
I intend to lay it out,
as with the Dr. Gilbert video,

27:19.888 --> 27:21.264
case by case.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.350
What do you keep
checking for?

27:24.184 --> 27:26.770
Well, when someone
does something batshit,

27:26.770 --> 27:28.355
you call in reinforcements.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.648
I had hoped they would show up

27:29.648 --> 27:32.359
before you rode the lightning--

27:35.403 --> 27:38.531
I hear you're going
full Section 8.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.827
Talk to me, son.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.251
Got your due diligence
on Mental.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.212
That was fast.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.964
That's why they call me
the cheetah.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.385
They do not really
call me that.

27:58.385 --> 28:01.596
Anyhoo, their business model
is strong like bull.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.516
They hire the doctors full time,
so no per diem work.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.018
Nobody has to deal
with the insurance company.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.228
They do it for you.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.064
Major employee
and patient retention.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.399
They seem to be insulated

28:12.399 --> 28:14.609
from the current
healthcare crapshack.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.237
And they have
a strong market share.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.280
So they're a winner.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.658
Not full-on Simone Biles,
but close.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.077
The bridge between
the therapeutic piece

28:24.077 --> 28:26.663
and the business piece
is not as strong as it could be.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.998
But you're just giving them
a pep talk, right?

28:28.998 --> 28:32.377
I believe so.
Do-- Do you think I should pass?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.754
No. I think it's got potential.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.089
It's a cool comp.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.508
In fact, I might want
to make an investment,

28:38.508 --> 28:41.094
buy some shares
on the private market.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.054
Go ahead.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.682
Thanks for the info.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.866
"Batshit."

29:02.866 --> 29:04.242
Ira texted that word to me.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.745
I figured he was just
allowing his anxiety

29:06.745 --> 29:08.121
to get the better of him,

29:08.121 --> 29:11.499
as his people
have a wont to do.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.001
We come by it honestly.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.294
The ones that didn't
have anxiety

29:14.294 --> 29:16.045
got run through
by Cossacks.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.297
No doubt.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.840
And in this case,
as back then,

29:18.840 --> 29:20.800
you were exactly right.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.969
It's the only word.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.304
Batshit.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.264
Destroying yourself
when you have enough people

29:26.264 --> 29:28.349
wanting to destroy you already?

29:28.349 --> 29:33.271
Confessing when no salvation
is actually available.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.816
At least his people put their
sins on the head of a goat

29:36.816 --> 29:38.401
and killed the damn goat.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.069
Actually, we'd just leave it
in the woods.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.947
And, uh, easy on the "my people"
stuff, how about?

29:42.947 --> 29:44.491
Yeah, you're right.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.786
I'm tense because I'm watching
our boy fall apart.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.371
So I'm-I'm letting fly
like I'm at the club,

29:50.371 --> 29:51.581
not out in world.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.542
You're right that I am not
after salvation.

29:54.542 --> 29:59.881
Oh, this is worse
than even I feared, then.

29:59.881 --> 30:03.343
You are wallowing in your guilt.

30:03.343 --> 30:07.305
Do you think I've never
felt guilt, Junior?

30:07.305 --> 30:10.350
I've felt it rise up
to the bottom of my throat,

30:10.350 --> 30:13.144
do a reach-around
and tickle my epiglottis.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.521
But did I self-immolate?

30:14.521 --> 30:17.106
- Guessing you did not?
- No.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.985
I discharged it with a weekend
on Isla Santana,

30:20.985 --> 30:22.362
in the West Indies.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.947
That's real? Isla Santana?

30:23.947 --> 30:27.534
One huge fee covers open bar
and unlimited assignations

30:27.534 --> 30:30.245
with an international staff
of professionals, right?

30:30.245 --> 30:32.789
I've-I've heard legend,
but you've been?

30:32.789 --> 30:33.665
You can confirm.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.042
Oh, I-I have
emptied my pockets

30:36.042 --> 30:40.421
and my glans
in that blessed place.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.258
It is real.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.635
So real that I had to play
some golf

30:45.635 --> 30:51.516
to get a break from all
the discharging of guilt.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.519
Came back a new man.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.897
I don't think a trip
to Debauchery Island

30:57.897 --> 30:59.691
is gonna do it for me.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.778
You should get tested
for low T.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.238
Chuck,
you're obviously right

31:05.238 --> 31:06.573
that true guilt
can't be assuaged

31:06.573 --> 31:08.199
by a romp in the sun
with nubiles.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.701
But that doesn't mean
that this is the time,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.453
is the place, is the venue,
is the forum--

31:15.832 --> 31:20.712
You know, much as I have enjoyed
watching you flail about,

31:20.712 --> 31:23.339
assuming that I am determined
to bayonet myself,

31:23.339 --> 31:26.926
I just-- I can't let it go on
any longer.

31:29.846 --> 31:34.142
You two are my most
loyal compadres, and as such,

31:34.142 --> 31:37.770
I will invite you
inside the lean-to.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.592
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.304
Uh, just an afternoon
green juice for me.

32:11.304 --> 32:12.472
No, no, I found one.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.432
A winner, that is,
I'm pretty sure.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.808
I want to put it
in front of Prince.

32:15.808 --> 32:18.478
A private company
I think will be good for him.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.730
For all of us. MPC.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.398
Have you run it
by Philip and Taylor?

32:22.398 --> 32:23.900
They're <i>occupado.</i>

32:23.900 --> 32:26.319
How would you like
to present with me?

32:26.319 --> 32:28.780
Well, I wouldn't.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.949
You haven't even heard the idea.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.200
I'm sure it's good.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.785
I'm just not sure you're sure.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.204
What about Tuk,
or someone else?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.706
Look, I know how you feel.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.917
It's not easy
going in and pitching.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.919
But if it's strong enough
to do with me,

32:42.919 --> 32:45.463
it's strong enough
to do on your own.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.633
You just have to be
strong enough.

32:57.934 --> 32:58.977
Hey there, boss.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.687
I got a seat reserved for you
on a bullet train

33:00.687 --> 33:03.982
about to leave
the fucking station.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.275
Um, that is the way

33:06.275 --> 33:09.028
the opening of a pitch sounds
around here, no?

33:09.028 --> 33:10.488
I mean, some people's.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.949
Why don't you just tell me
what it is while I take a look.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.201
Can do, can do.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.494
Company is called Mental.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.829
In the telehealth space.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.664
- You can see all the--
- Yeah, we've been wanting

33:19.664 --> 33:22.250
to get into health care since
we quietly slid out of Korlera.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.585
Cool model
with video therapy sessions

33:24.585 --> 33:26.337
and AI support.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.798
Direct insurance billing,
juicy receivables.

33:28.798 --> 33:33.011
They're poised to be both
very profitable and very good.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.346
For, you know, da people.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.015
Which is our brand.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.516
Bingo.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.309
I'm doing it again.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.228
Where'd you come up with this?

33:42.228 --> 33:43.354
Wendy.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.734
Yes?

33:49.944 --> 33:51.362
Thank you.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.240
I like it. I'll consider it.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.368
Can I have my tablet back?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.885
Does not augur well,
all of us here.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.971
We are not filled
with lightness and joy, no.

34:16.971 --> 34:20.433
Take a look at this.
It's a screenshot I grabbed.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.351
I see Taylor.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.020
That's the foreground
element, yes.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.190
They are at the hotel where they
stayed when they went to London.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.567
You say "hotel" like it has
quotation marks around it.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.527
Indeed. Sacker and I
had suspicions

34:31.527 --> 34:33.821
that there are mutineers
in the company.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.074
And then I remembered
this image.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.119
I'm guessing it is not a hotel.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.663
No. Not. Expert confirmed.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.208
I have a printout of the report,
but you don't need it.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.001
What you need to know is this:

34:47.001 --> 34:50.546
This molding is a unique design.
One of a kind.

34:50.546 --> 34:52.965
Decorating the walls
of Haddon Hall,

34:52.965 --> 34:55.468
a castle owned and,
when this picture was taken,

34:55.468 --> 34:58.429
occupied by Bobby Axelrod.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.021
It is high risk.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.356
High danger.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.191
Asymmetrical return
if you're right.

35:10.191 --> 35:14.362
It is everything I have told you
to have the acorns to try.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.738
Thank you.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.657
Ain't saying
it's gonna work.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.409
Just saying I understand.

35:20.409 --> 35:24.038
And like Watson's 17th hole
at the '82 Open,

35:24.038 --> 35:27.125
ballsy to claim when
you're staring down Nicklaus.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.836
- And had he failed--
- But he didn't.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.504
Called the birdie,
hit the birdie.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.132
May Chuck be so lucky.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.717
I guess I'm not
your attorney anymore,

35:36.717 --> 35:39.595
so I have no real standing
to advise you against this.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.763
And I won't,

35:40.763 --> 35:43.015
because as your friend,
I get it too.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.031
The first time
I bent the rules.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.493
Actually, let me be more clear.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.538
The first time I abused
my position of office

36:05.538 --> 36:07.707
and broke the law--

36:07.707 --> 36:09.625
the first I remember, anyway--

36:09.625 --> 36:11.919
was back when I was
a line prosecutor.

36:11.919 --> 36:16.215
I had this witness
who wanted to recant.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.427
So, I made it clear to him

36:19.427 --> 36:22.013
that that was not
gonna work.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.519
So, yeah, thanks for coming.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.980
Really great
to meet in person.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.191
Okay, are we gonna talk
about the supposed topic

36:33.191 --> 36:34.775
of my pretend speech?

36:34.775 --> 36:37.862
Or do you want to tell me
what I'm really doing here?

36:38.571 --> 36:40.156
- Of course.
- Damn, she's good.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.950
The speech was a smoke screen
so you could get me in

36:42.950 --> 36:44.160
and hire me as a consultant?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.995
Since I have
a combination of skills

36:45.995 --> 36:49.582
in therapy and performance,
and a grounding in business.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.917
Am I close?

36:50.917 --> 36:52.251
You're not far off.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.795
The speech was a smoke screen
for consulting,

36:54.795 --> 36:57.423
which was a smoke screen
for the real position.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.466
Oh.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.052
Our CEO is stepping down,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.471
and like you said, you have
the unique qualification

37:03.471 --> 37:04.722
to take the seat.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.224
You give us the best chance
to do good work,

37:06.224 --> 37:08.559
and you can help people
do and be their best

37:08.559 --> 37:11.062
and build a profitable company
along with it.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.522
You'd own a nice piece
of the company.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.982
You'd be responsible
for the day-to-day

37:14.982 --> 37:17.193
- as much as you want to be.
- A lot, we hope.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.195
Plus how and where we expand,

37:19.195 --> 37:21.489
how to keep our therapists
doing optimal work.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.907
The vision of the company.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.784
- Our former--
- Soon-to-be-former--

37:24.784 --> 37:28.955
Right, soon-to-be-former CEO
has a very limited vision

37:28.955 --> 37:30.915
of what this company
really can be.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.459
As founders, we spend most
of the time pushing him.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.669
Leading from behind.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.255
We want someone
who's eyes-forward,

37:37.255 --> 37:39.090
and we think that's you.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.134
The compensation package.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.821
- We have to assume.
- Come on, we know.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.990
Yes, we know
that Wags and Wendy

38:03.990 --> 38:05.283
were also with Taylor,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.743
and went to Axelrod
when they were in London,

38:07.743 --> 38:09.120
supposedly on company business.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.623
My allies, lined up against me
with my enemy.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.625
Fire them all. For cause.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.044
That's the feeling, yes, but...

38:17.044 --> 38:19.046
Yes, but if you fire them now,

38:19.046 --> 38:21.173
the bulk of the C-suite
of your eponymous firm,

38:21.173 --> 38:24.677
you'll look like a bad hirer
and a worse manager.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.846
Things will feel unstable.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.889
Plus, they will have
a story to tell.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.141
And they will find a way
to tell it.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.767
Out in the world,
free radicals.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.686
It is far too dangerous
to keep them here.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.895
I can create a pathway,

38:34.895 --> 38:37.064
work it so that when
they are fired,

38:37.064 --> 38:38.566
they will be forced to sign NDAs

38:38.566 --> 38:40.067
in exchange for our promise
not to sue

38:40.067 --> 38:43.321
and seek prosecution of each one
for corporate espionage.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.323
Not now, Kate, but...

38:56.751 --> 38:58.544
Wendy. Come see me.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.213
Meet in my office in 15.

39:01.213 --> 39:02.673
Stay here.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.425
Consider scenarios.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.344
But do nothing.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.349
<i>The first time
I abused my position of office</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:13.684
<i>and broke the law--</i>

39:16.854 --> 39:18.189
Despite what's said on here,

39:18.189 --> 39:20.691
it's a lot of wins
represented on this video.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.859
Big ones.

39:21.859 --> 39:24.070
Cases and ops I was proud
to be a part of.

39:24.070 --> 39:27.031
- And bad people went to prison.
- I know, Karl.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.909
And nothing that happens
will change my scorecard.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.328
Our scorecard.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.081
This isn't my swan song.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.875
You don't want me
to talk you out of it,

39:37.875 --> 39:39.293
- I'm not going to.
- Good.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.754
Now I'm gonna want
all that on a drive

39:41.754 --> 39:43.714
that can't be copied.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.383
All right.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.142
What's the thing?

39:55.142 --> 39:59.105
I've become aware of Mental,
and your involvement.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.858
I don't think it's a conflict.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.527
I'll be speaking and advising,

40:04.527 --> 40:07.905
helping get their therapists
rowing in the right direction.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.949
They're giving me stock
as comp.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.617
All okay.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.743
I agree.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.787
But I have info
about the company

40:14.787 --> 40:16.956
that might help shape
your next steps with them.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.999
The CEO is stepping down.

40:18.999 --> 40:22.545
The board will want someone with
your credentials to take over.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.047
That tracks.
They hinted around it,

40:25.047 --> 40:27.049
but I'm here.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.176
I didn't take the gig.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.761
You know, one thing I've learned

40:30.761 --> 40:32.638
about how to make my people
more effective

40:32.638 --> 40:34.306
is to let them stretch.

40:34.306 --> 40:37.184
I won't lose you if I
encourage you to take leaps.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.770
I-I'll still need you
to work with me

40:39.770 --> 40:41.272
and my top performers.

40:41.272 --> 40:45.192
But also, you could help train
some of the Mental therapists

40:45.192 --> 40:47.111
to work with our younger people.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.612
Synergies are there.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.657
Don't mistake this as being
entirely selfless on my part.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.492
I make a score
on the company.

40:53.492 --> 40:56.203
And I know that when I get
to the White House,

40:56.203 --> 41:00.040
you won't just stay here
with the folks that are left.

41:00.040 --> 41:04.837
But now, maybe I lock in
half of you.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.344
Thank you, Mike.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.641
So I wanted to sit
with you privately

41:58.641 --> 42:01.894
and ask you some important
questions, because, in a way,

42:01.894 --> 42:05.105
I feel like you speak
for the whole trading floor.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.691
Have any of you
considered leaving?

42:08.234 --> 42:10.277
Hey, I just got back.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.238
I signed a two-year contract.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.406
I have two years left as well.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.200
Okay.

42:17.117 --> 42:18.202
Do you feel you're growing?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.579
You mean our books?

42:20.579 --> 42:21.914
Our returns?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.208
It's been hard.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.418
Yeah, it has been hard.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.796
Hard to make progress
building good momentum

42:28.796 --> 42:30.673
when we're getting
whipsawed around.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.966
Yeah.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.592
Drop hot foreign money.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.553
No more ESG. Go domestic.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.137
"Do good"?

42:37.137 --> 42:38.847
Fuck's sake,
that's not a strategy.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.558
It's been a real pain
in the boccis

42:40.558 --> 42:42.434
trying to find the alpha
through this noise.

42:42.434 --> 42:47.731
Wait, are you asking us about
leaving because you're leaving?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.609
Well, you all did kind of say
that all I was good for lately

42:50.609 --> 42:51.902
was performance coaching.

42:51.902 --> 42:54.280
- But that's a real need.
- Duh.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.575
Will there be a new resource
put in place for us?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.201
Hey!

42:59.201 --> 43:01.453
They're not gonna be
half as good as Wendy.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.914
But...

43:03.914 --> 43:05.249
if you train them,

43:05.249 --> 43:07.167
and they can get us back
to where you get us,

43:07.167 --> 43:11.714
then, hey, get your ya-ya's.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.597
This isn't a session.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.433
Or it's a different kind
of session.

43:23.642 --> 43:24.810
I've made a decision,

43:24.810 --> 43:26.937
and I want to do this
in front of you.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.945
Robin? It's Wendy Rhoades.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.531
I'm accepting your offer.

43:37.531 --> 43:40.326
I've got the DocuSign
on my iPad,

43:40.326 --> 43:42.328
and I've had my lawyer
review it,

43:42.328 --> 43:44.455
so we should be good
to start Monday.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.293
Me too.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.920
And I will see you then.

43:56.675 --> 43:58.302
Well...

43:58.302 --> 43:59.970
You know, it's true,

43:59.970 --> 44:03.140
I... I can't abandon
those people at the firm,

44:03.140 --> 44:07.311
despite the state
of my relationships right now.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.313
But I also can't abandon
the prospect

44:09.313 --> 44:11.148
of helping all those
other people out there,

44:11.148 --> 44:13.025
Mental users who I might
be able to touch

44:13.025 --> 44:14.818
through this new company.

44:25.371 --> 44:28.749
And I can't run from what Chuck
has put in front of me.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.837
I need to do it all.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.047
Somehow.

44:35.047 --> 44:38.175
And just think how good
you have made me feel.

44:38.175 --> 44:42.096
I will go home tonight
knowing that I, too,

44:42.096 --> 44:44.848
have made a small difference.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.687
That's exactly
where I am going right now.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.066
Home.

44:54.066 --> 44:56.360
To try to do the same thing.

45:19.883 --> 45:22.344
I'm bringing you something
I didn't plan on bringing you.

45:22.344 --> 45:25.556
I get what you mean faster
than most anyone you know,

45:25.556 --> 45:28.308
but even I need, like,
one or two more words.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.854
Prince is so smart.
So careful.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.398
So intentional right now.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.108
He just did something for me
that I know

45:36.108 --> 45:37.860
he couldn't have wanted to do,
but he did it

45:37.860 --> 45:42.156
to make me even more beholden
to him, even more in his debt.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.159
And I don't matter at all
compared to most of the folks

45:45.159 --> 45:46.535
he's gonna really be working.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.579
Yeah. He got himself
to where he got himself

45:48.579 --> 45:50.122
because he's very fucking good.

45:50.122 --> 45:51.457
So, the problem is,

45:51.457 --> 45:54.376
if he is the existential threat
we know him to be,

45:54.376 --> 45:56.044
and he's that good,

45:56.044 --> 45:58.714
well, it brought me
to a certain conclusion.

45:58.714 --> 46:01.175
The one that got you
to decide to bring us

46:01.175 --> 46:02.468
whatever it is
you weren't going to.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.762
The conclusion
that we can't do it.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.346
Can't stop him.

46:06.346 --> 46:07.598
Not alone.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.933
That we're depriving
ourselves of a weapon.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.143
But that weapon...

46:11.143 --> 46:12.603
Okay, now I am there.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.563
You're about to say
your ex-husband's name,

46:14.563 --> 46:17.149
because while we have
certain information,

46:17.149 --> 46:18.525
he has tools
that we don't have.

46:18.525 --> 46:20.944
Chuck? She's about
to say Chuck?

46:20.944 --> 46:22.196
Shit.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.322
He came to me.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.157
But not in his old way.

46:25.157 --> 46:29.119
He approached
with an earnestness.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.370
I was moved, actually.

46:30.370 --> 46:32.915
You're saying he got you
to trust him?

46:32.915 --> 46:35.626
He's been working
on himself.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.794
Hold on.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.504
Let me look at you.

46:42.090 --> 46:43.300
This is bad.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.677
You kind of look like
maybe he got to you.

46:45.677 --> 46:48.096
As if you opened
your heart to him.

46:48.096 --> 46:50.015
No. No way.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.310
Maybe I wanted to hear
what he had to say.

46:55.395 --> 46:56.605
Maybe I wanted to offload

46:56.605 --> 46:58.148
some of the responsibility.

46:58.148 --> 47:01.401
But, yes, I find myself
trusting him again.

47:01.401 --> 47:03.946
Adding law enforcement?
The top fucking prosecutor?

47:03.946 --> 47:06.949
Making him privy to shit
we've done and will have to do,

47:06.949 --> 47:08.242
that's bad for all of us.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.118
I don't care what it means
for all of us.

47:10.118 --> 47:12.663
I do, however,
care what it means for her.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.708
Shit.

47:24.007 --> 47:25.175
There's something
I have to do

47:25.175 --> 47:27.719
before we go any further
with this.

47:31.098 --> 47:33.517
Are we supposed
to just wait here?

48:04.715 --> 48:08.010
Mr. Wagner.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.803
You don't know me.

48:09.803 --> 48:10.804
Not really.

48:10.804 --> 48:13.557
You may think of me
as a right-hand man,

48:13.557 --> 48:15.475
a second-in-command,

48:15.475 --> 48:17.561
a facilitator, a fixer.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.522
You may not take me very
seriously because of that.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.024
But know this:

48:22.024 --> 48:23.275
when I set my sights

48:23.275 --> 48:25.193
on accomplishing
something important,

48:25.193 --> 48:26.570
I take dead aim,

48:26.570 --> 48:29.364
and I systematically go over
or through everything in my path

48:29.364 --> 48:32.242
until I have reached
that objective.

48:33.243 --> 48:38.165
So consider this your warning.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.459
I know you've been
sweet-talking Wendy,

48:40.459 --> 48:41.835
making assurances to her,

48:41.835 --> 48:44.588
saying a lot of shit
I've heard from you in the past.

48:44.588 --> 48:48.091
But that woman is made
of the finest stuff

48:48.091 --> 48:49.468
on this earthly plane.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.261
Stuff that wretches like us

48:51.261 --> 48:53.138
can only appreciate,

48:53.138 --> 48:55.390
not truly apprehend.

48:55.390 --> 48:56.767
She's ripped herself open

48:56.767 --> 48:58.685
to help the people
at our company survive

48:58.685 --> 49:00.687
the roughest of transitions.

49:00.687 --> 49:03.357
And she deserves
the opposite of betrayal.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.650
On this we agree.

49:04.650 --> 49:08.070
Which is why I will not
allow you to hurt her.

49:08.070 --> 49:13.575
And if somehow you find your way
around me and do hurt her,

49:13.575 --> 49:15.369
if you cross her

49:15.369 --> 49:16.620
or fuck her over,

49:16.620 --> 49:19.581
then fucking you back
will become my mission--

49:19.581 --> 49:24.878
my sole motherfucking reason
for being.

49:24.878 --> 49:29.257
And then there'll be nothing
for you to hide behind,

49:29.257 --> 49:32.260
because I will come for you.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.388
I don't know how,

49:34.388 --> 49:36.974
but I will figure it
the fuck out,

49:36.974 --> 49:40.727
and I will get you.

49:40.727 --> 49:44.106
It is not my intention
or my plan.

49:44.106 --> 49:45.357
You have my word.

49:45.357 --> 49:48.610
Your word means rat shit.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.487
Bubonic plague rat shit.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.614
Rat shit even the other rats
won't touch.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.199
- You're right.
- I am right.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.660
I mean, I know I'm right.

49:57.452 --> 49:59.204
I'm right? You just said that?

49:59.204 --> 50:02.332
Yeah. So, let's go.

50:08.922 --> 50:12.426
I think we're just about
squared away on Wendy for now.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.845
One issue left.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.681
Who do we actually trust
to oversee the place

50:17.681 --> 50:20.726
once I put the others in a box?

50:25.188 --> 50:27.691
Great. Done.

50:29.609 --> 50:31.153
Call 'em in.

50:31.153 --> 50:32.863
All of 'em.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.416
Thank you all for coming
to this meeting,

50:44.416 --> 50:46.251
this uneasy alliance.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.253
That's a fucking understatement.

50:49.796 --> 50:51.548
I have come to understand
what it will take

50:51.548 --> 50:54.426
to make it possible for us to
work together in this endeavor.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.429
And I have gone
to those lengths.

50:58.638 --> 51:00.932
This is a drive
that cannot be copied.

51:00.932 --> 51:05.479
It contains a cataloguing
of moves I have made,

51:05.479 --> 51:08.440
extralegal and plain illegal,

51:08.440 --> 51:10.317
that would flush me
from office

51:10.317 --> 51:12.903
and public life irrevocably,

51:12.903 --> 51:15.113
would get me disbarred
and jailed

51:15.113 --> 51:16.656
if it were to come out.

51:16.656 --> 51:18.992
Okay, and that proves what?

51:18.992 --> 51:21.453
I have always
been highly skilled

51:21.453 --> 51:25.499
at earning people's trust
through means legit and illegit.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.626
- And at betraying it, Chuck.
- Yes.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.044
That too.

51:29.044 --> 51:34.257
And so I realize that
now I need to give trust.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.344
Wendy, I know if I hand you
this material,

51:37.344 --> 51:39.429
you will never
use it against me,

51:39.429 --> 51:40.680
even if I deserve it,

51:40.680 --> 51:42.557
for the sake of our children.

51:42.557 --> 51:44.309
Sadly true.

51:44.309 --> 51:48.647
But Wags will not hesitate

51:48.647 --> 51:49.940
to ruin me,

51:49.940 --> 51:53.777
as he just made painfully clear
in my office.

51:54.611 --> 51:57.823
So my only question is,
do you trust him

51:57.823 --> 52:00.492
not to burn me with this

52:00.492 --> 52:03.954
if I do right by all of you?

52:08.291 --> 52:09.584
With my life.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.461
Then I do, too.

52:18.593 --> 52:19.719
Do you have a plan,

52:19.719 --> 52:21.138
now that we can all
trust each other?

52:21.138 --> 52:24.099
I have a goal.
Take Mike Prince's billions.

52:24.099 --> 52:26.768
Separate him from the thing
that makes him so powerful

52:26.768 --> 52:28.687
and attractive to the voters.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.856
Without his money
he is Superman,

52:30.856 --> 52:33.316
and the entire planet
is Kryptonite.

52:33.316 --> 52:35.694
And we're all suddenly supposed
to figure out how to do this

52:35.694 --> 52:37.737
after we've been trying
and failing to do it,

52:37.737 --> 52:40.073
jointly and separately,
for months?

52:40.073 --> 52:42.742
There is a way to us
finding a way.

52:42.742 --> 52:44.911
Another player,
similarly motivated,

52:44.911 --> 52:46.872
who would be a great weapon,

52:46.872 --> 52:50.375
and one who is near and dear
to your hearts.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.673
Prince calling me in for a meet.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.884
Me too. Right now.
At his house.

52:58.884 --> 53:02.012
Same. That ain't good.

53:04.639 --> 53:06.224
We have to go.

53:12.522 --> 53:15.609
<i>We light our lamps</i>

53:15.609 --> 53:18.695
<i>For atmosphere</i>

53:18.695 --> 53:21.740
<i>And hang our hopes</i>

53:21.740 --> 53:24.826
<i>On chandeliers</i>

53:24.826 --> 53:27.996
<i>We're going long</i>

53:27.996 --> 53:30.498
<i>We're gaining weight</i>

53:30.498 --> 53:33.627
<i>We're sleeping long</i>

53:33.627 --> 53:36.796
<i>And far too late</i>

53:36.796 --> 53:40.383
<i>And so it's time</i>

53:40.383 --> 53:45.597
<i>To change our ways</i>

53:45.597 --> 53:51.269
<i>But I've loved these days</i>

53:55.649 --> 53:57.275
Are we...?

54:11.248 --> 54:13.750
This doesn't even look
fun adjacent.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.044
No. Not fun at all.

54:16.044 --> 54:19.881
Wendy, Wags and Taylor have been
plotting an assassination.

54:19.881 --> 54:22.133
My assassination.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.016
Staying silent
is the first wise thing

54:30.016 --> 54:31.851
any of you have done
in a long while.

54:31.851 --> 54:35.730
Do you need me to get security
to escort them out?

54:35.730 --> 54:37.482
I won't be firing
the three of them

54:37.482 --> 54:39.276
and making this public.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.318
Not yet.

54:40.318 --> 54:43.321
No, they're gonna be punished
in a different way.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.991
First, they're gonna lose
every cent of bonus money

54:45.991 --> 54:47.325
they have coming to them,

54:47.325 --> 54:50.704
and their other money
is gonna remain in the fund,

54:50.704 --> 54:53.999
gated, to insure
no further disloyalty.

54:53.999 --> 54:55.750
They'll also lose
their reputations

54:55.750 --> 54:59.504
when they lose the corporate
espionage suit we've filed.

54:59.504 --> 55:01.965
Oh, that's right.
We haven't filed it yet.

55:01.965 --> 55:04.676
But that's, uh...
that's good to go, right, Kate?

55:04.676 --> 55:06.720
Yeah. Hey, it's all ready.

55:06.720 --> 55:10.098
Signed and sealed,
waiting to be delivered.

55:10.098 --> 55:14.644
You're all frozen in place.

55:16.688 --> 55:19.149
Wendy, you're lame-ducked here.

55:19.899 --> 55:22.152
You'll execute
your new CEO duties,

55:22.152 --> 55:24.946
and if nothing else goes wrong,

55:24.946 --> 55:27.949
you'll fully onboard there
after the election.

55:27.949 --> 55:29.993
At which time you'll be fired.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.412
If you haven't
figured it out yet,

55:32.412 --> 55:35.999
I'm a majority owner
of Mental through a shell corp.

55:38.710 --> 55:41.463
Taylor, you're done.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.048
No authority.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.925
No log-in privileges.

55:45.925 --> 55:47.802
A figurehead.

55:47.802 --> 55:52.557
Call it garden leave,
but inside a glass box.

55:56.978 --> 56:00.398
One notable exception to
the outward-facing status quo.

56:00.398 --> 56:04.986
Wagner, you'll lose your ability
to authorize large trades.

56:04.986 --> 56:06.946
And small trades.

56:06.946 --> 56:07.989
And paystubs.

56:07.989 --> 56:09.282
You can just kind of walk around

56:09.282 --> 56:12.369
shouting nonsense mantras
to the traders.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.580
So for you,
nothing really changes.

56:18.541 --> 56:19.959
And Philip.

56:19.959 --> 56:22.420
Philip, my boy.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.838
My boy.

56:23.838 --> 56:25.715
Take a look at this.

56:27.967 --> 56:29.552
<i>Whatever plan you're considering,</i>

56:29.552 --> 56:30.929
<i>leave me out.</i>

56:30.929 --> 56:33.014
<i>Whatever you and Taylor
and I don't know who else</i>

56:33.014 --> 56:35.016
<i>are thinking about doing,
I can't.</i>

56:35.016 --> 56:37.143
<i>Won't. I don't even want to.</i>

56:37.143 --> 56:40.063
<i>I need, and I will have,
complete deniability.</i>

56:40.063 --> 56:43.525
<i>As-is, right now, there is
nothing I could tell anyone,</i>

56:43.525 --> 56:44.692
<i>nothing I should tell anyone.</i>

56:44.692 --> 56:46.027
<i>I aim to keep it that way.</i>

56:46.027 --> 56:48.571
<i>Then you do that.</i>

56:51.616 --> 56:53.326
My office?
You fucking can't--

56:53.326 --> 56:55.870
Before you complain
about the violation

56:55.870 --> 56:57.455
of your doctor-patient
privilege, Wendy,

56:57.455 --> 56:59.207
you should know
that Philip signed a waiver

56:59.207 --> 57:01.793
before that session,
didn't you, Philip?

57:04.337 --> 57:06.548
Of course.

57:06.548 --> 57:08.299
Yes, I did.

57:12.178 --> 57:14.806
Philip will now be vested
with the sign-off power

57:14.806 --> 57:16.558
Wags has been stripped of.

57:18.101 --> 57:19.519
We're done with you.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.771
So you can go.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.413
You have the conn.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.748
Make us some money
heading into the election.

57:40.748 --> 57:43.168
Help me win.

57:47.714 --> 57:48.965
Notify the on-call pilot.

57:48.965 --> 57:51.676
Get the Global Express
gassed and fired up.

57:51.676 --> 57:53.595
- Destination?
- London.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.680
I'm going to Haddon Hall.

57:57.682 --> 58:01.603
<i>So before we end</i>

58:01.603 --> 58:04.230
<i>And then begin</i>

58:04.230 --> 58:07.567
<i>We'll drink a toast</i>

58:07.567 --> 58:10.904
<i>To how it's been</i>

58:10.904 --> 58:13.781
<i>A few more hours</i>

58:13.781 --> 58:16.784
<i>To be complete</i>

58:16.784 --> 58:19.245
<i>A few more nights</i>

58:19.245 --> 58:22.916
<i>On satin sheets</i>

58:22.916 --> 58:25.919
<i>A few more times</i>

58:25.919 --> 58:30.840
<i>That I can say</i>

58:31.424 --> 58:36.387
<i>I've loved these days</i>
