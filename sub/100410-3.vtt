00:34.894 --> 00:36.894
Boss wants to see you.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.894
Get in.

00:48.694 --> 00:50.413
There you go, Nadya.

00:50.414 --> 00:51.734
Oh, hi!

00:56.979 --> 00:58.893
Nadya, hurry up, love!

00:58.894 --> 00:59.894
Yeah.

01:19.894 --> 01:22.200
What's up, freak?

01:23.768 --> 01:25.181
- Freak!
- Freak!

01:25.182 --> 01:26.353
Oi!

01:26.354 --> 01:27.720
Leave him alone!

01:27.721 --> 01:29.820
Unless you lads want to get off and walk?

02:59.894 --> 03:01.894
Come on, mate, wake up!

03:04.894 --> 03:06.894
Hey, get over here, have you seen this?

03:23.894 --> 03:25.893
Boss is here.

03:28.894 --> 03:30.698
Luke Sumner. 27 years old.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.217
Had his wallet
and keys on him.

03:32.218 --> 03:34.057
Yeah, and good
morning to you, too.

03:34.058 --> 03:36.180
Sorry.
Morning, Ma'am.

03:36.698 --> 03:39.537
So, money and
card in his wallet?

03:39.538 --> 03:41.897
Yeah, had a debit card and 25 quid.

03:41.898 --> 03:44.100
So, likely
not a mugging.

03:44.738 --> 03:46.697
- Phone?
- Not on him.

03:46.698 --> 03:48.397
{\an3}He was found by the binmen.

03:48.421 --> 03:50.620
{\an3}He'd been punched in the face.
And I've secured the flat,

03:50.698 --> 03:52.697
{\an3}it's over at Stannersby House...

03:52.698 --> 03:54.697
{\an3}- which is just...
- Ah, I know it.

03:54.698 --> 03:56.698
Yeah,
that's not far.

03:57.698 --> 04:00.058
Well, let's have
a look at him.

04:03.698 --> 04:05.697
So, what can you
tell us, Malcolm?

04:05.698 --> 04:08.497
Well, he's been
dead 6 or 7 hours.

04:08.698 --> 04:12.058
Sometime between midnight and 1:00AM.

04:13.206 --> 04:14.697
I couldn't swear
on a cause yet...

04:14.698 --> 04:16.173
But what...?

04:16.175 --> 04:18.697
Well, he's received multiple blows,

04:18.697 --> 04:22.697
including one to the face
with an associated head injury.

04:22.698 --> 04:24.408
Oh, something interesting,

04:24.409 --> 04:27.697
there are no defensive wounds
on his hands.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.897
So someone attacks him and he just
stands there and lets them?

04:30.898 --> 04:32.377
Possibly.

04:32.378 --> 04:37.057
I'd say it's highly likely that
he died as a result of an assault.

04:37.058 --> 04:38.416
Did he die here?

04:38.417 --> 04:39.697
I don't know that yet.

04:39.698 --> 04:42.537
Well, if they were trying
to hide the body,

04:42.538 --> 04:43.697
they did a terrible job.

04:46.698 --> 04:47.738
Malcolm.

04:49.378 --> 04:50.698
Unzip his jacket.

04:53.698 --> 04:56.152
"ECS"?

04:56.253 --> 04:57.478
What's that?

04:57.479 --> 04:58.698
I have no idea.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.267
Mark, can you find out
what ECS stands for?

05:02.268 --> 05:03.697
It's a company logo on his T-shirt.

05:03.698 --> 05:05.697
Look, I'm afraid that's your lot
for the time being.

05:05.698 --> 05:07.737
Yeah, OK, Malcolm.
I know the drill.

05:07.738 --> 05:09.377
Glad to hear it.

05:09.378 --> 05:12.580
I look forward to sharing
my findings with you ASAP.

05:14.698 --> 05:16.697
Right. Anything?

05:16.698 --> 05:19.697
Er, ECS. Eldon Cleaning Services.

05:19.698 --> 05:22.697
They're a corporate cleaning company
based down by the quayside.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.697
That's the old
oil distribution place, hmm?

05:25.698 --> 05:26.737
Er, yeah, looks like it.

05:26.738 --> 05:28.697
Right, so, get hold of them, Mark.

05:28.698 --> 05:31.697
And see if they can tell us
the lad's whereabouts last night.

05:31.698 --> 05:35.697
And collect any CCTV
between here and Stannersby House.

05:35.698 --> 05:38.463
- Ma'am.
- Jac, we're going over to Stannersby.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.697
Grab some uniforms, and talk to
everyone who lives there.

05:41.698 --> 05:42.698
Yes, Ma'am.

05:42.699 --> 05:44.384
You got the key?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.698
Uniform will have it.

05:47.268 --> 05:49.377
Lift's out of order.

05:49.378 --> 05:50.697
What floor's it on?

05:50.698 --> 05:51.698
Seven.

05:53.698 --> 05:55.697
You're not even breaking a sweat!

05:55.698 --> 05:57.737
I'm in training for the Great North Run.

05:57.738 --> 05:59.377
Training?

05:59.378 --> 06:00.697
What, on top of your hours?

06:00.698 --> 06:02.478
I bet the missus is pleased with that.

06:02.479 --> 06:04.697
I don't know. She likes me fit.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.538
Oh, that's too much information.

06:13.528 --> 06:15.168
Bleach.

06:17.292 --> 06:20.580
Either our lad's been cleaning,
or someone else has.

06:28.643 --> 06:30.843
Well, he could've been working
till past midnight,

06:30.868 --> 06:32.708
if these are his shifts.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.698
Hello. There's a phone here.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.697
- "Nadya", three missed calls.
- Yeah, well, who's Nadya?

06:41.699 --> 06:42.897
Phone's locked.

06:42.898 --> 06:45.698
I'll get onto the mobile provider.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.698
Well, kept himself tidy.

06:52.058 --> 06:53.698
Very tidy.

06:56.448 --> 06:59.448
And it looks like someone's
kicked the door in here.

07:00.698 --> 07:02.698
Looks recent.

07:03.698 --> 07:06.697
Now, was that Luke, or somebody else?

07:06.698 --> 07:08.291
You were right about the bleach.

07:08.292 --> 07:10.498
There's gallons of the stuff in here.

07:15.221 --> 07:16.897
Get forensics up here.

07:16.898 --> 07:19.698
See if they can pull up
anything interesting.

07:23.221 --> 07:24.697
Had he just moved in?

07:24.698 --> 07:27.392
Neighbours told uniform he'd been
living here for over four years.

07:27.393 --> 07:29.697
You'd never know it, would you?

07:29.698 --> 07:32.697
No telly, no radio, no laptop,

07:32.698 --> 07:34.220
nothing.

07:36.058 --> 07:37.698
Living like a monk.

07:53.698 --> 07:55.697
Ah, thanks, Kenny.

07:55.698 --> 07:59.697
Ma'am, ECS have confirmed
that Luke worked for them.

07:59.698 --> 08:00.698
Right.

08:02.898 --> 08:05.150
- There's sugar in that!
- Yeah.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.338
Now, have we found next of kin?

08:07.339 --> 08:10.377
Er, Carmel Sumner.
Lives in Lingford, near Rothbury.

08:10.378 --> 08:11.697
She doesn't know yet.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.424
How do I know that name?

08:13.425 --> 08:15.017
Seth Sumner, Ma'am.

08:15.018 --> 08:16.392
The boy's dad.

08:16.393 --> 08:18.306
Seth Sumner!

08:18.307 --> 08:21.697
Of course, killed in his home
by a burglar, right?

08:21.698 --> 08:24.267
Yeah, must be 12, 13 year ago?

08:24.268 --> 08:26.384
- The burglar got life.
- Kayle?!

08:26.385 --> 08:27.697
Terence Kayle.

08:27.698 --> 08:29.897
Had a failed parole hearing
three weeks ago.

08:29.898 --> 08:33.537
And didn't Kayle's brother
have some history with us?

08:33.538 --> 08:34.697
Rings a bell.

08:34.698 --> 08:37.197
Get your shovel out, Kenny,
do some digging.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.697
Yes, Ma'am.

08:38.698 --> 08:40.697
Mark, find me anything you can,

08:40.698 --> 08:43.049
and piece together his last 24 hours.

08:43.075 --> 08:44.143
Ma'am.

08:46.140 --> 08:49.660
Now, how on Earth are we going
to tell that lad's mam?

09:29.409 --> 09:30.609
Mrs Sumner?

09:30.980 --> 09:32.378
Aye.

09:34.245 --> 09:35.697
How did he die?

09:35.698 --> 09:39.057
Oh, well, we're not sure yet, love.

09:39.058 --> 09:41.509
But we'll know very soon.

09:41.510 --> 09:43.697
But you think someone else was involved?

09:43.698 --> 09:47.150
I mean, you must do, a DCI coming round.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.860
Well, we're keeping all lines
of enquiry open, pet.

09:52.698 --> 09:55.698
This is like some sort of a sick joke.

09:56.698 --> 10:01.299
His dad, he was murdered here,
protecting us.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.998
Aye. I know he was.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.726
Now I've lost them both.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.620
Oh, God.

10:12.698 --> 10:15.698
- I'll get you a drink of water.
- I'll get it.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.698
Here you go.

10:26.362 --> 10:28.820
Aye, than... thank you.

10:32.944 --> 10:36.424
Mrs Sumner, when did you last
have contact with your son?

10:38.491 --> 10:40.331
Um, he came to see me

10:41.503 --> 10:43.503
about a month ago.

10:43.698 --> 10:45.697
You hadn't spoken since?

10:45.698 --> 10:47.378
No.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.940
He was always busy working.

10:51.268 --> 10:52.268
Cleaning.

10:54.378 --> 10:57.058
Can you think of anyone
who would have wanted to harm him?

10:58.077 --> 10:59.557
No.

11:02.534 --> 11:04.534
Did he have a partner?

11:06.093 --> 11:07.573
I don't know.

11:08.698 --> 11:10.698
I don't know.

11:12.698 --> 11:14.697
This can wait, love.

11:14.698 --> 11:16.098
We'll go.

11:21.698 --> 11:24.980
Is there someone we can call for you?

11:26.014 --> 11:28.220
I just want to see me son.

11:28.698 --> 11:30.698
We'll let you know as soon as you can.

11:58.698 --> 12:01.494
Luke Sumner, aged 27,

12:01.495 --> 12:03.158
his body was found this morning

12:03.159 --> 12:06.697
by binmen in the underpass,
off Ayrton Road.

12:06.698 --> 12:09.697
He's thought to have been
the victim of an assault.

12:09.698 --> 12:13.697
Now, he was wearing a T-shirt
with an ECS logo on it.

12:13.698 --> 12:15.697
And that's a cleaning firm in Newcastle.

12:15.698 --> 12:19.697
And DC Edwards is interviewing staff
as we speak.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.291
Now, er, is he on the system?

12:22.292 --> 12:25.697
He got a caution for possession
of half a gram of cannabis in 2008.

12:25.698 --> 12:27.697
2008, nothing more recent?

12:27.698 --> 12:28.897
OK.

12:28.898 --> 12:32.697
Run a check on his medical history
as a matter of priority.

12:32.698 --> 12:34.697
- Yep.
- Now, Kenny, phone records?

12:34.698 --> 12:37.697
Oh, I've put a request into
his mobile service provider.

12:37.698 --> 12:38.698
No response yet.

12:38.699 --> 12:40.970
Yeah, well, put a rocket under them,
Kenny!

12:40.971 --> 12:43.158
We need to know who this Nadya is.

12:43.159 --> 12:45.166
- Ma'am.
- Bank records?

12:45.167 --> 12:48.869
Well, apart from rent and bills,
he withdrew money every Friday.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.447
For the last two weeks, it's been £150.

12:51.448 --> 12:55.205
But for the seven months
before that, it was £250.

12:55.206 --> 12:57.697
- Yeah, how much in the account?
- Um...

12:57.698 --> 12:59.698
nearly £5,000.

12:59.723 --> 13:02.100
So he was a saver.

13:03.698 --> 13:07.322
I want to know what that extra
hundred quid a week was for.

13:07.323 --> 13:08.897
And why it stopped.

13:08.898 --> 13:12.377
I mean, his flat was hardly flash,
was it?

13:12.378 --> 13:14.697
More the opposite.
He had a credit card as well,

13:14.698 --> 13:18.283
which wasn't in his wallet,
and forensics haven't found it yet.

13:18.284 --> 13:21.698
Oh, right, well,
let's keep an eye out for that, hmm?

13:22.432 --> 13:24.478
Er, what about his neighbours, Jac?

13:24.479 --> 13:25.837
Oh, they last saw him
yesterday morning.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.697
They only know if he's in
if his light's on,

13:27.698 --> 13:28.698
and it wasn't last night.

13:28.699 --> 13:30.698
Oh, well, that's helpful

13:31.698 --> 13:34.306
Kenny, what about the burglar's brother?

13:34.307 --> 13:36.057
Name's Raymond Kayle, Ma'am.

13:36.058 --> 13:38.697
Er, he's been inside for GBH
a couple of years ago.

13:38.698 --> 13:39.698
Has he?

13:39.699 --> 13:43.306
He now runs the Wayside Gym.
It's a not-for-profit gym.

13:43.307 --> 13:46.314
Oh, and the lad's mother, Carmel Sumner,

13:46.315 --> 13:47.853
sent a letter that was read

13:47.854 --> 13:50.697
at Terence's most recent parole hearing.

13:50.698 --> 13:51.897
Did she?

13:51.898 --> 13:55.697
It was pretty damning, it's one
of the reasons he wasn't released.

13:55.698 --> 14:00.392
Well, there could be a grudge there,
it's a possible link.

14:00.393 --> 14:02.697
Good work, Kenny!

14:02.698 --> 14:03.698
Mark?

14:03.699 --> 14:05.737
Er, Luke walked off his shift yesterday.

14:05.738 --> 14:07.597
Any idea why?

14:07.698 --> 14:10.698
Had an argument with one
of their minibus drivers.

14:11.503 --> 14:13.023
Did he indeed?!

14:34.417 --> 14:35.417
Poor lad.

14:35.418 --> 14:37.236
He'd worked with us two-and-a-half years.

14:37.237 --> 14:38.416
Longer than anyone.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.416
Two-and-a-half years?
Well, that's not very long.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.056
Oh, that's a lifetime here.

14:43.057 --> 14:44.416
We have a high staff turnover.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.616
It's hard work, night shifts.
It's not for everyone.

14:46.617 --> 14:49.416
Oh, this is Clive, my husband.

14:49.417 --> 14:51.416
This is DCI Stanhope and DS Healy.

14:51.417 --> 14:53.456
I couldn't believe it when I heard.

14:53.457 --> 14:56.416
It's such a shame.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.752
We only saw him yesterday.

14:57.753 --> 14:59.416
Oh, what time was that?

14:59.417 --> 15:02.256
About half 12,
when he went off to a shift.

15:02.257 --> 15:04.416
One of our drivers was bringing him
back here for his next one,

15:04.417 --> 15:06.416
when he got really upset on the minibus.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.416
Yeah, we heard they'd argued?

15:08.417 --> 15:10.416
Wait, Luke argued.

15:10.417 --> 15:13.257
Jojo just wanted him to stay calm.
He was scaring folk.

15:14.198 --> 15:16.198
Had Luke kicked off like that before?

15:16.223 --> 15:18.223
Oh, never.
He was our most reliable cleaner.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.248
- He was a team leader.
- Aye, but...

15:20.273 --> 15:21.833
Oh, come on...

15:23.307 --> 15:24.707
But what?

15:25.476 --> 15:27.476
He hadn't been
quite as reliable recently.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.301
He was turning up late.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.416
Had an attitude.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.456
Jojo told him I wanted a word with him,

15:33.457 --> 15:36.256
and that's when he kicked off.

15:36.257 --> 15:38.456
So what was going on with him last week?

15:38.457 --> 15:40.416
Why the attitude?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.416
That's what I wanted to ask him about.

15:45.937 --> 15:48.416
Hey, it's a big set-up you've got here.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.416
Aye, one of the biggest in the region.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.416
250 cleaners.

15:52.417 --> 15:55.416
Ooh, that must take some organising.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.416
Staff clock in here every shift,
collect their equipment.

15:58.417 --> 16:01.166
Then our minibuses take them
to work and bring them back.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.456
We give them a structure.

16:02.457 --> 16:05.456
Strict timekeeping, you know,
the discipline of clocking in.

16:05.457 --> 16:08.416
We also give them housing and transport.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.417
You provide
accommodation?

16:11.261 --> 16:12.801
Oh...

16:13.026 --> 16:15.386
But Luke wasn't in
one of your places, was he?

16:15.417 --> 16:17.416
No, no, he already had his
own place when he came to us.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.776
But we do provide
accommodation for the others.

16:19.777 --> 16:22.822
Make sure they've got somewhere safe
and decent to put their heads down.

16:22.823 --> 16:24.189
Well...

16:24.190 --> 16:25.417
Impressive.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.776
Right, I'm going to need
everything you've got on Luke

16:29.777 --> 16:31.127
for the last 3 months.

16:31.128 --> 16:33.416
Time sheets,
who he was working with, where.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.416
I'll get straight on it.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.150
Thanks, love.

16:37.151 --> 16:38.416
Oh. And, er...

16:38.417 --> 16:40.936
do you have a Nadya working here?

16:40.937 --> 16:43.417
Um... got a Nadya Dinev?

16:44.417 --> 16:47.416
She and Luke worked together a lot.
Made a good team.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.936
Oh, well, where will I find Nadya?
And Jojo?

16:49.937 --> 16:51.517
I'll just check.

16:54.417 --> 16:57.416
Yeah, they are both
at Towfield Shopping Centre.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.937
Ah, thanks, love.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.415
He totally overreacted.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.415
All I said was
Mr Brock wanted to see him.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.415
- Did it get physical?
- Only on his side.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.415
He kept booting the door.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.415
I just told him to stop damaging the bus.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.415
Hey! Moz!

17:21.416 --> 17:23.257
Not on my time!

17:25.204 --> 17:27.204
Surprised me, going off like that.

17:27.416 --> 17:28.776
Usually good as gold.

17:28.777 --> 17:30.416
It's always the quiet ones,
though, in't it?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.776
Oh, is that what he was, quiet?

17:32.777 --> 17:35.416
Yeah. Bit of a pushover.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.416
Why was he worried about seeing Mr Brock?

17:37.417 --> 17:38.417
I don't know.

17:38.418 --> 17:40.776
- I just let him out, and he ran off.
- Right.

17:40.777 --> 17:43.236
- Well, can you tell us where, love?
- Yeah.

17:43.237 --> 17:45.417
- Have you got an address?
- Er, yeah...

17:48.417 --> 17:49.417
Nadya Dinev?

17:49.418 --> 17:51.416
Um. Unit number five.

17:51.417 --> 17:52.937
Thanks, love.

17:59.417 --> 18:01.417
I'm sorry, pet.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.257
Nadya Dinev?

18:09.617 --> 18:12.936
DCI Vera Stanhope.

18:12.937 --> 18:16.417
Er, I need to talk to you
about Luke Sumner.

18:19.417 --> 18:22.417
Well, I'm guessing you've heard
what's happened to him.

18:23.784 --> 18:25.824
Why'd you call him last night?

18:27.260 --> 18:28.456
I mean, what was that?

18:28.457 --> 18:30.416
Work, or...?

18:30.417 --> 18:32.416
It wasn't like him to miss a shift.

18:32.417 --> 18:36.244
So it was nothing to do with
the argument he had with Jojo?

18:36.245 --> 18:37.416
What argument?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.417
Well, on the minibus between shifts.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.417
You don't know what that was about?

18:45.417 --> 18:47.416
But you called him three times, love,

18:47.417 --> 18:50.150
so it must have been something important.

18:50.151 --> 18:52.416
Please, we're not supposed to
make phone calls at work.

18:52.417 --> 18:54.306
We get into trouble.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.588
Well, what sort of trouble?

18:55.589 --> 18:57.096
Nadya.

18:57.097 --> 18:59.417
You finished in here? We need to go.

19:00.417 --> 19:01.417
If that's all right?

19:02.417 --> 19:04.417
Yep. I'm done.

19:05.807 --> 19:06.807
For now.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.256
Do you think she's involved?

19:20.257 --> 19:21.940
She's something.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.417
Definitely scared.

19:25.143 --> 19:27.143
We need to keep our eye on her.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.416
He died from an extradural haematoma.

19:42.417 --> 19:46.417
Now, as I suspected,
he didn't die immediately.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.307
The impact damaged a blood vessel.

19:49.332 --> 19:51.385
The bleed got trapped
inside his skull cavity,

19:51.417 --> 19:54.616
started coning, compressed the brain.

19:54.617 --> 19:58.095
Specifically, the area
controlling his respiratory system.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.978
He would've become increasingly confused.

19:59.979 --> 20:02.416
And then stopped breathing.

20:02.417 --> 20:03.936
So, when did the trauma happen?

20:03.937 --> 20:05.776
Up to five hours before he died.

20:05.777 --> 20:08.416
He was a dead man walking, as soon
as he received the head injury.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.416
- So between 7:00PM and 1:00AM?
- Yeah.

20:11.417 --> 20:14.416
Well, I presume he wasn't
standing there for five hours

20:14.417 --> 20:16.174
where we found him, waiting to die.

20:16.175 --> 20:19.220
So the crime scene was somewhere else.

20:19.221 --> 20:21.456
Agreed. Now, we did find some alcohol

20:21.457 --> 20:23.416
in his system, not a significant amount.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.236
About three units.

20:25.237 --> 20:29.416
But whatever caused the impact
was completely smooth.

20:29.417 --> 20:31.416
Because his skin remained unbroken.

20:31.417 --> 20:35.416
Or maybe someone punched him,
and he fell and hit his head?

20:35.417 --> 20:37.417
Or they hit Luke with something.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.205
Well, look at that. That's some punch!

20:41.206 --> 20:43.416
- Yes. I want to show you that.
- Are these linked?

20:43.417 --> 20:45.096
Er, possibly.

20:45.097 --> 20:48.196
Now, there's something interesting
going on in the centre of that abrasion.

20:48.263 --> 20:49.416
- Can you see?
- Mm-hm.

20:49.417 --> 20:52.119
I'd like to get in a
specialist infrared photographer

20:52.120 --> 20:53.416
to take a closer look at that.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.416
Is that your way of asking
if I'll pay for it?

20:56.417 --> 20:57.417
Yes.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.017
Oh, go on, then.

21:00.018 --> 21:01.416
Will you pay for it?

21:01.417 --> 21:03.417
- Yes.
- Good.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.416
Now...

21:06.417 --> 21:11.416
there are multiple bruises
on Luke's shins.

21:11.417 --> 21:14.416
And then, further up, we have these.

21:14.417 --> 21:17.776
They are small areas of burn scarring

21:17.777 --> 21:19.936
and patches of linear abrasion.

21:19.937 --> 21:21.416
You said he was a cleaner?

21:21.417 --> 21:22.697
Commercial cleaner.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.416
Right, well,
looking at the shape of these,

21:24.417 --> 21:26.416
they could well be chemical.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.417
- Could it be bleach?
- Quite possibly.

21:29.237 --> 21:31.892
And has he done this himself,
or has someone done it to him?

21:31.925 --> 21:34.776
Either. They're all in places
which are easy to hide.

21:34.777 --> 21:37.456
But they're definitely deliberate,
not accidental.

21:37.457 --> 21:41.936
So, just to recap,
it was a blow to Luke's temple

21:41.937 --> 21:44.416
which led directly to his death.

21:44.417 --> 21:45.417
Right.

21:45.418 --> 21:48.416
Now, was there anything else
in his system

21:48.417 --> 21:49.612
other than the alcohol?

21:49.637 --> 21:52.416
No traces of drugs,
prescribed or otherwise.

21:52.417 --> 21:54.417
- Right, thanks, Malcolm.
- Thank you.

22:18.417 --> 22:21.416
Jojo Walters, minibus driver
for ECS, thank you,

22:21.417 --> 22:23.416
he confirmed that he dropped Luke off

22:23.417 --> 22:27.416
at 6:15PM on the corner
of Romer Street and Hargreaves Road.

22:27.417 --> 22:30.416
Now, that was about an hour before

22:30.417 --> 22:33.416
Malcolm estimates
Luke got this head injury.

22:33.417 --> 22:37.078
So what happened to him
after he got off that minibus?

22:37.079 --> 22:39.416
We need to find the crime scene.

22:39.417 --> 22:43.039
Jac, check CCTV, see if you can
trace his journey.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.416
- Ma'am.
- His co-worker didn't say much.

22:45.417 --> 22:46.417
Hmm.

22:46.418 --> 22:49.416
The bosses seemed nice enough,
didn't they? Caring.

22:49.417 --> 22:51.416
I wasn't keen on Jojo Walters.

22:51.417 --> 22:52.417
No.

22:52.418 --> 22:55.416
You can check him out, Kenny,
see if he's on the system.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.094
- Ma'am.
- And, Mark...

22:57.095 --> 22:59.258
run a background check on the company.

22:59.259 --> 23:01.616
- Might as well touch all bases.
- Ma'am.

23:01.617 --> 23:04.416
Now, where are we
with the lad's phone records?

23:04.417 --> 23:06.250
Er, they're just in, Ma'am.

23:06.251 --> 23:07.750
Er, used it mainly for work,

23:07.751 --> 23:10.172
apart from four calls over four weeks.

23:10.173 --> 23:13.416
The number's registered
to Jasmine Ashers.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.617
Er, the last call he made
to her was for over an hour.

23:15.618 --> 23:17.648
- Hour?!
- Aye, that was seven days ago.

23:17.649 --> 23:19.456
Well, our lad wasn't that quiet,

23:19.457 --> 23:21.456
- then, was he?
- No.

23:21.457 --> 23:24.416
- You got an address?
- Er, they're sending it over.

23:24.417 --> 23:27.936
Right, Jasmine Ashers.

23:27.937 --> 23:29.416
See if she's at ECS.

23:29.417 --> 23:30.570
Will do, Ma'am.

23:30.571 --> 23:33.816
Oh, I checked Luke's medical records.
There's nothing recent.

23:33.897 --> 23:36.316
I mean, he didn't register
with a GP once he left Lingford,

23:36.317 --> 23:37.595
and that was 9 years ago.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.516
Yeah, well,
what about hospital records?

23:39.517 --> 23:41.034
Nothing. There weren't any.

23:41.060 --> 23:44.716
Ma'am, Luke's mother
is on her way to ID his body.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.593
Shall I go?

23:46.617 --> 23:48.017
Mm.

23:53.928 --> 23:55.088
No...

23:55.417 --> 23:56.740
No, I'll do it.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.256
Oh, I know this isn't
the right time to tell you,

24:16.257 --> 24:19.416
Mrs Sumner,
but we now know Luke was assaulted.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.417
There was someone else involved
in your son's death.

24:24.457 --> 24:26.936
Do you know who it was?

24:26.937 --> 24:28.417
Not yet.

24:29.417 --> 24:32.416
So I am gonna have to ask you
some tricky questions.

24:32.417 --> 24:34.789
But that's only because I need to...

24:34.790 --> 24:37.417
Look, I know how this works.
I've done it before.

24:38.417 --> 24:40.417
Aye, I know you have, love.

24:42.276 --> 24:43.740
And I'm sorry.

24:45.417 --> 24:49.416
But are there any issues
I should be made aware of?

24:49.417 --> 24:51.416
What kind of issues?

24:51.417 --> 24:53.116
Well...

24:53.417 --> 24:55.257
Luke's mental health?

24:57.269 --> 24:58.900
No, I don't know.

24:59.923 --> 25:02.416
I mean, he always kept his business
very private.

25:02.417 --> 25:03.711
Deep waters,
that was Luke.

25:03.712 --> 25:07.416
Ah, well, it must've been hard on him...

25:07.417 --> 25:09.936
when his dad died the way he did.

25:09.937 --> 25:11.777
Yeah, course. He was heartbroken.

25:14.417 --> 25:16.547
It was a very difficult time for us...

25:16.548 --> 25:20.416
Yeah, I can imagine,
and I'm sorry to have to ask,

25:20.417 --> 25:24.417
but did Luke ever harm himself
deliberately, hmm?

25:26.937 --> 25:29.117
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

25:29.118 --> 25:34.109
Well, we found some unexplained
scarring on his body.

25:34.110 --> 25:36.280
Did he ever talk to you about that?

25:38.069 --> 25:39.229
No.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.637
No, I never knew anything.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.617
Luke hardly talked to me.

25:46.260 --> 25:49.060
He always had some excuse
not to come home.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.717
Why was that, do you think?

25:53.417 --> 25:56.616
I wasn't in a good place after Seth died,

25:56.617 --> 25:59.417
and I took it out on Luke.

26:01.417 --> 26:03.160
I drove him away.

26:04.417 --> 26:07.417
I thought he'd be better off
away from me.

26:09.245 --> 26:11.245
I got that wrong.

26:19.217 --> 26:22.817
Well, here's another one you probably
won't be able to answer, love.

26:23.777 --> 26:26.416
Er, Jasmine Ashers...

26:26.417 --> 26:28.080
mean anything?

26:28.417 --> 26:30.717
She lives in Lingford with her mam.

26:32.937 --> 26:36.616
- So, was she and Luke mates?
- No, I don't think so.

26:36.617 --> 26:40.356
I mean, they saw each other for a
couple of months when they were kids.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.297
She was getting married soon.

26:42.298 --> 26:44.417
He... he wasn't invited.

26:48.284 --> 26:52.124
So you heard Terence Kayle
applied for parole?

26:52.149 --> 26:54.502
Day for celebration, that was,
when he didn't get it.

26:54.527 --> 26:55.514
Aye.

26:55.539 --> 26:58.416
Do you know that his brother
came round to see me?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.617
He wanted me to help him!

27:01.323 --> 27:03.140
That was a mistake.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.431
Raymond Kayle
came to your house?

27:06.517 --> 27:09.416
Aye, I slammed the door in his face.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.416
The police came round later,

27:11.417 --> 27:13.417
I think one of my neighbours must
have called them.

27:23.354 --> 27:25.354
Listen to this.

27:25.696 --> 27:30.203
Raymond Kayle paid a visit
to Luke's mam four weeks ago.

27:30.204 --> 27:34.257
Someone called the police,
and I wanna know who that was.

27:36.284 --> 27:38.940
Er, Ma'am, I checked out Jojo Walters.

27:38.965 --> 27:41.485
Clean as a whistle.
Not even a parking ticket.

27:41.510 --> 27:43.990
Well, tell Mark to carry on
sniffing about.

27:44.015 --> 27:46.560
- He's talking to someone now.
- Yeah, good.

27:46.585 --> 27:48.645
Boss, about Jasmine Ashers...

27:48.670 --> 27:51.770
Yeah, well, if you're gonna tell me
she lives in Lingford, I already know.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.820
She's a geography teacher
at The Woodrow Academy.

27:54.845 --> 27:56.845
Yeah, right. Well, that's local.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.390
- Go fetch her in.
- A bit tricky.

27:59.415 --> 28:02.735
She went on a school trip yesterday
at 5:00AM with 30 year 12s.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.120
But she's back tomorrow.

28:04.145 --> 28:07.145
Right, the second she's back,
I want to see her.

28:15.447 --> 28:18.447
Kenny. Which neighbour called uniform?

28:21.927 --> 28:23.688
So, what's the name again?

28:23.689 --> 28:26.926
Jason Hay,
he called the evening of the 17th.

28:26.927 --> 28:27.927
Right.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.447
Come on in.

28:41.927 --> 28:44.926
I'll have to sit. It's my back.

28:44.927 --> 28:46.516
I can't stand too long,

28:46.517 --> 28:48.926
I can't sit too long. Nightmare.

28:48.927 --> 28:50.926
So, is this about Raymond Kayle?

28:50.927 --> 28:52.602
Er, partly.

28:52.603 --> 28:56.126
Yes, we wondered why you called
the police four weeks ago.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.617
Haven't you read the report?

28:57.618 --> 28:59.926
Oh, aye, but it's always good
to hear it direct.

28:59.927 --> 29:01.926
- Can I?
- Yeah, er, right.

29:01.927 --> 29:04.446
OK, well, er,
Kayle had no right coming round.

29:04.447 --> 29:05.926
I'm protective of Carmel.

29:05.927 --> 29:08.926
She's been through enough,
and I told him so, too!

29:08.927 --> 29:10.926
- Told him to leave her alone!
- How did that go?

29:10.927 --> 29:12.926
- He started on me.
- He threatened you?

29:12.927 --> 29:15.148
He didn't actually threaten me.

29:15.149 --> 29:17.141
But I know his type.

29:17.142 --> 29:19.602
It would've escalated if I hadn't
said I'd call the police.

29:19.603 --> 29:21.926
Why are you asking about him?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.160
Hiya, Dad.

29:24.665 --> 29:28.226
Georgia, love, it's the police, they've
come round about Raymond Kayle.

29:28.287 --> 29:30.927
That was weeks ago...
did he come back?

29:31.247 --> 29:33.547
Dad was dead shaken up after.

29:33.927 --> 29:36.167
What's Raymond done now?

29:36.860 --> 29:41.926
Well, we're also here...
about Carmel's son, Luke.

29:41.927 --> 29:43.826
What about him?

29:43.927 --> 29:46.926
He's dead, love.
His body was found in Newcastle.

29:46.927 --> 29:48.360
Yesterday.

29:50.927 --> 29:52.520
I'm sorry.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.547
Sit down, love.

30:00.020 --> 30:01.647
How did it happen?

30:01.700 --> 30:04.336
Well, he'd been assaulted. Head injury.

30:04.337 --> 30:06.966
Where was it? Where did it happen?

30:06.967 --> 30:08.286
We don't know.

30:08.287 --> 30:12.446
Well, his body was found
near to his flat. But...

30:12.447 --> 30:13.926
Oh, that's awful.

30:13.927 --> 30:16.286
He was like a brother to Georgia
when she was younger.

30:16.287 --> 30:17.926
He was a lovely young man.

30:17.927 --> 30:19.926
- So you were in touch?
- Not really.

30:19.927 --> 30:22.926
Saw him when he came back
a few weeks ago to see Carmel,

30:22.927 --> 30:25.926
but only through the window.
Haven't talked to him in years.

30:27.689 --> 30:29.927
I'm sorry. I've got to take this.

30:31.927 --> 30:34.927
Now, do you know Jasmine Ashers?

30:35.340 --> 30:37.926
She lives round the corner.
We're both going to her wedding.

30:37.927 --> 30:40.926
I'm told she used to go out
with Luke, is that right?

30:40.927 --> 30:42.370
Yeah.

30:42.571 --> 30:45.446
For about two minutes
when they were younger.

30:45.447 --> 30:47.719
- She looked down her nose at him.
- You don't know that.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.100
Oh, come on, of course she did.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.126
Ma'am...

30:52.127 --> 30:55.926
Right. Now, if you do think
of anything else,

30:55.927 --> 30:58.327
could you just give us a ring, love?

31:02.927 --> 31:05.926
Mark's sent a copy of Luke's shifts
and a client list.

31:05.927 --> 31:08.227
There's one client
you need to look at.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.186
He was a cleaner
at Raymond Kayle's gym!

31:14.287 --> 31:16.927
Try telling me that's a coincidence!

31:26.927 --> 31:28.927
Decent gym, this.

31:29.927 --> 31:31.327
Is it?

31:32.187 --> 31:34.446
It's full of posers and sweat!

31:34.447 --> 31:35.926
Well, I'll give you the sweat.

31:35.927 --> 31:37.688
But the mirrors, that's not for posing.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.926
That's about good form, technique...

31:39.927 --> 31:41.127
There's Kayle.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.926
What Terry did was wrong,
I'm not excusing it.

31:46.927 --> 31:48.126
But Seth used undue force.

31:48.127 --> 31:50.606
And not for the first time.

31:50.607 --> 31:54.126
I wanted Carmel to go on the record,
say he could be aggressive.

31:54.127 --> 31:57.927
So who said he'd used force before?

31:58.418 --> 32:00.818
I thought it was common knowledge.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.767
When did you last see Luke Sumner?

32:04.395 --> 32:06.102
Why are you
asking about him?

32:06.103 --> 32:09.927
Oh, because he's dead, love.
Victim of an assault.

32:10.420 --> 32:13.461
Now, we know he worked here
six weeks ago.

32:13.462 --> 32:14.926
He requested it.

32:14.927 --> 32:17.926
And then a week later,
you ring his bosses

32:17.927 --> 32:20.539
and say you don't want him here.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.760
I haven't seen him since he left.

32:22.927 --> 32:26.027
He wanted to talk about Terry.
I said I wouldn't.

32:26.927 --> 32:28.926
Where were you 2 nights ago?

32:28.927 --> 32:30.926
- Why?
- Where were you?

32:30.927 --> 32:31.927
Here.

32:31.928 --> 32:34.926
Painting a changing room
till midnight. Then I went home.

32:34.927 --> 32:35.927
Anyone confirm that?

32:35.928 --> 32:37.286
It was midnight.

32:37.287 --> 32:39.867
The gym was closed. What do you think?

32:52.564 --> 32:55.966
Do you believe what he said
about Seth Sumner having a temper?

32:55.967 --> 32:58.539
There was nothing in the police report.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.126
He seemed shocked about Luke.

33:00.127 --> 33:01.926
Well, he would be, wouldn't he?

33:01.927 --> 33:05.927
If it was him who assaulted him
5 hours before he died.

33:15.607 --> 33:16.607
Jac.

33:17.509 --> 33:20.926
I need you to check out
Raymond Kayle's alibi.

33:20.927 --> 33:24.526
Reckons he was sprucing up his changing
rooms in the middle of the night.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.664
Will do.

33:25.665 --> 33:28.526
Oh, Ma'am, I tried to get hold of
Nadya Dinev to take a statement,

33:28.527 --> 33:30.527
but she didn't show up for work.

33:31.723 --> 33:34.523
- Did you try calling her?
- She didn't answer.

33:35.489 --> 33:36.489
Hmm...

33:36.927 --> 33:39.126
That doesn't sound right.

33:39.127 --> 33:40.926
Have you got an address for her?

33:40.927 --> 33:41.927
Oh, yeah.

33:41.928 --> 33:44.926
She's in one of the properties
owned by ECS.

33:44.927 --> 33:47.286
Apparently, they've got loads.
They house most of their staff.

33:47.287 --> 33:50.780
Aye, the Brocks mentioned that.
Thanks, Jac.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.794
Right, Aiden.

33:54.927 --> 33:56.927
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you in a bit.

34:19.447 --> 34:22.927
They've got two people sharing in here.

34:24.286 --> 34:25.927
Size of it!

34:26.927 --> 34:29.656
I thought that Sonia said
she looked after her staff...

34:29.657 --> 34:30.926
What you doing?

34:30.927 --> 34:32.926
Northumberland and City Police.

34:32.927 --> 34:35.453
I'm DS Healy, this is DCI Stanhope.

34:35.454 --> 34:37.656
- Is this your room, love?
- Yeah.

34:37.751 --> 34:39.380
I'm gonna go and get a residents list.

34:41.927 --> 34:43.926
We're looking for Nadya.

34:43.927 --> 34:45.927
Why, what's she done?

34:53.967 --> 34:55.926
Where's all her stuff?

34:55.927 --> 34:58.926
Well, we were hoping
you could tell us that.

34:58.927 --> 35:00.727
I've only just finished work.

35:00.728 --> 35:02.781
I've been on since yesterday afternoon.

35:02.782 --> 35:04.926
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

35:11.927 --> 35:13.927
Can I help you?

35:18.827 --> 35:22.026
- Look, we need to have a chat, love.
- I've got nothing to say.

35:22.028 --> 35:23.560
What's your name?

35:23.927 --> 35:24.927
Daisy.

35:24.928 --> 35:27.926
Daisy, I'm going to be
in the Wexford Cafe

35:27.927 --> 35:29.926
that's just around the corner,

35:29.927 --> 35:33.026
and I'd very much like it
if you'd come and have a chat,

35:33.027 --> 35:36.127
if you change your mind. Hm?

35:37.927 --> 35:39.927
Please. For Nadya.

35:40.927 --> 35:43.127
'Cause I'm worried about her.

35:57.927 --> 36:01.260
Have you got any idea at all
where she might have gone?

36:02.801 --> 36:04.881
You sure about that, love?

36:06.594 --> 36:09.220
Or what do you think happened to her?

36:09.927 --> 36:12.227
We won't say that you talked to us.

36:14.824 --> 36:18.824
Look, if nobody says anything,
nothing's gonna change, is it, pet?

36:18.849 --> 36:20.049
Hm?

36:24.485 --> 36:26.926
Stuff happens to people
the bosses don't like.

36:26.927 --> 36:29.767
Rooms get cleared out,
people disappear.

36:30.298 --> 36:32.926
So what sort of people
do the bosses not like?

36:32.927 --> 36:34.926
Anyone that doesn't do what they say,

36:34.927 --> 36:36.926
complains, talks back.

36:36.927 --> 36:38.926
Oh, was that what she did? Talk back?

36:38.927 --> 36:40.966
I don't know. We're never
really on the same shifts.

36:40.967 --> 36:43.606
And when you talk about "the bosses",

36:43.607 --> 36:45.926
does that include Jojo, the driver?

36:45.927 --> 36:47.926
Jojo just does what he's told.

36:47.927 --> 36:49.926
I'm on about Mr and Mrs Brock.

36:49.927 --> 36:52.866
The Brocks punish us.
Dock our wages, cut our shifts.

36:52.927 --> 36:56.926
They charge for everything.
Rent, electricity, transport.

36:56.927 --> 36:58.606
How much is your rent?

36:58.607 --> 36:59.926
£200 a week.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.446
It's a zero-hour contract.

37:02.447 --> 37:04.926
You've got to get there
an hour before, get your equipment,

37:04.927 --> 37:06.117
get on the minibus...

37:06.118 --> 37:08.926
They don't pay you for travelling,
only when you're cleaning.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.926
They call travel time break time.

37:10.927 --> 37:12.966
I did 60 hours straight once.

37:12.967 --> 37:15.926
Minibus to shift to minibus to shift.

37:15.927 --> 37:17.927
I only got paid for 40 hours.

37:18.927 --> 37:21.127
What about Luke Sumner?

37:21.927 --> 37:23.926
Their golden boy?

37:23.927 --> 37:25.126
Didn't trust him.

37:25.127 --> 37:27.807
Must be a reason
he'd been there so long, right?

37:29.669 --> 37:31.860
Well, thanks for coming over, love.

37:33.598 --> 37:35.920
Did the Brocks do something to him?

37:36.879 --> 37:39.620
Well, we'll be exploring every avenue.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.380
But if I were you, pet...

37:42.447 --> 37:44.487
I'd start looking for another job.

37:48.927 --> 37:52.926
Nadya Dinev's missing.
She's a person of interest.

37:52.927 --> 37:55.926
So get in touch with airport,
train stations,

37:55.927 --> 37:57.766
and the port authority.

37:57.767 --> 37:59.633
Get her ID out there.

37:59.634 --> 38:02.336
She might be trying
to get back home to Bulgaria.

38:02.337 --> 38:03.830
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Er, has anyone tried

38:03.855 --> 38:04.961
contacting the family?

38:04.962 --> 38:07.926
- Oh, I've been trying, but no answer.
- Yeah, well, keep trying, Jac.

38:07.927 --> 38:10.926
Er, I did some more
background work on ECS.

38:10.927 --> 38:12.926
Me and Kenny spoke with
some of the ex-staff.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.286
The Brocks are bad news.

38:14.287 --> 38:16.926
Intimidation, threats, you name it.

38:16.927 --> 38:19.926
Hmm, right, did any of the staff
mention Luke?

38:19.927 --> 38:22.894
Weren't sure about him.
Thought he was too quiet.

38:22.927 --> 38:24.926
Never knew if he was
reporting back on them.

38:24.927 --> 38:27.826
Yeah, they didn't trust him.
They thought he was stand-offish.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.626
Yeah, but that could be because
he was quiet and had his own place.

38:30.627 --> 38:33.426
Well, I also spoke with all the
companies that Luke cleaned for,

38:33.447 --> 38:35.766
and there was something
Clive and Sonia held back.

38:35.767 --> 38:36.926
What?

38:36.927 --> 38:39.926
Well, last month at Hazelwoods,
it's an office in town,

38:39.927 --> 38:41.386
they caught Luke stealing.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.260
They reported it to Sonia Brock.

38:46.927 --> 38:48.927
Well, well, well...

38:53.927 --> 38:57.926
Well, yes, I've been so worried.
Haven't seen her since yesterday.

38:57.927 --> 39:00.926
Do you think she might have
something to do with Luke's death?

39:00.927 --> 39:02.286
You were worried?

39:02.287 --> 39:03.641
Of course.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.327
But not enough to report it?

39:05.328 --> 39:06.926
Well, I didn't know until first thing,

39:06.927 --> 39:08.926
when she missed her shift.
She's not a child.

39:08.927 --> 39:11.926
Yeah, but you knew
we'd been asking after her.

39:11.927 --> 39:13.926
Her co-worker had been murdered.

39:13.927 --> 39:15.926
When you put it like that...

39:15.927 --> 39:19.441
And why didn't you tell us he'd been
caught stealing from Hazelwoods?

39:19.447 --> 39:21.536
You told them you were gonna
deal with it in-house.

39:21.537 --> 39:23.227
Why didn't you tell us that?

39:23.927 --> 39:25.926
He never did anything like it before.

39:25.927 --> 39:27.766
I didn't think it was important.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.926
I decide what's important, love.

39:29.927 --> 39:31.225
So what did he steal?

39:31.226 --> 39:33.826
£60 of petty cash.

39:33.927 --> 39:35.742
Someone left it open on a desk.

39:35.743 --> 39:38.926
And this theft wasn't reported
to the police, at your request.

39:38.927 --> 39:40.926
He didn't lose any shifts.

39:40.927 --> 39:44.927
And it's not on record.
So how did you deal with it?

39:46.470 --> 39:48.966
I'm admin, Clive's more HR.

39:48.967 --> 39:51.641
You'll have to talk to him.
I'll call him.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.480
Don't bother, pet!

39:59.618 --> 40:02.026
I gave him a verbal warning
and the benefit of the doubt.

40:02.027 --> 40:03.926
It was a one-off.

40:03.927 --> 40:05.926
Well, isn't that generous of you?

40:05.927 --> 40:06.927
Come on.

40:06.928 --> 40:09.926
He'd been with us for years,
he was a hard worker.

40:09.927 --> 40:12.026
I kept a closer eye on him,
of course.

40:12.027 --> 40:13.680
Oh, I bet you did.

40:14.127 --> 40:16.446
So why did he get so worked up

40:16.447 --> 40:18.926
when Jojo said
you wanted to see him?

40:18.927 --> 40:19.927
I don't know.

40:19.928 --> 40:21.926
All I was gonna do was
give him a written warning.

40:21.927 --> 40:23.926
I'd given him a verbal one
over the thefts.

40:23.927 --> 40:27.220
Whatever was going on with Luke
was nothing to do with me.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.840
I don't believe a word that they said.

40:53.865 --> 40:56.225
Acting like they care
about their staff...

40:56.287 --> 40:57.926
Nonsense.

40:57.927 --> 40:59.926
60 quid out of petty cash?

40:59.927 --> 41:01.926
I mean, why would he do that?

41:01.927 --> 41:04.926
Temptation? Saw the money and grabbed it?

41:04.927 --> 41:06.926
But the fella lived like a monk!

41:06.927 --> 41:09.140
Plus he'd got five grand in his bank.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.762
No, there's something else going on here.

41:14.754 --> 41:17.794
I reckon those two
are as dirty as they come.

41:33.927 --> 41:34.927
Night.

41:38.447 --> 41:42.926
Will someone please give me
some news on Nadya's whereabouts?

41:42.927 --> 41:44.559
Sorry, Ma'am.
We've got nothing yet.

41:45.607 --> 41:47.758
- Well, any luck with her family?
- Er, yeah.

41:47.759 --> 41:48.926
Yes?

41:48.927 --> 41:51.826
Yeah. I've just heard
from her grandma in Bulgaria.

41:51.827 --> 41:54.026
- But she hasn't heard anything.
- Do you believe her?

41:54.027 --> 41:55.926
Well, yeah.
She sounded worried.

41:55.927 --> 41:57.926
And she looks after
Nadya's two daughters.

41:57.927 --> 41:58.927
Oh...

41:58.928 --> 42:01.446
Also, Nadya sends
money home each week.

42:01.447 --> 42:02.926
Only up until recently,

42:02.927 --> 42:04.695
she was sending more
than she was earning.

42:04.696 --> 42:07.502
- How much more?
- A hundred quid a week.

42:07.571 --> 42:09.926
That'll be that extra
hundred quid a week

42:09.927 --> 42:11.926
Luke was drawing out!
He was giving it to her.

42:11.927 --> 42:13.508
Why?

42:13.509 --> 42:15.926
Ma'am, that was Luke's
neighbour on the phone,

42:15.927 --> 42:18.926
they said they heard an argument
on the first and again on the 10th.

42:18.927 --> 42:21.026
- Both times with a woman.
- The same woman?

42:21.027 --> 42:22.587
They didn't know.

42:23.020 --> 42:25.446
Ma'am, Jasmine Ashers is downstairs.

42:25.447 --> 42:28.426
- Just back, came straight here.
- At last!

42:28.447 --> 42:31.027
Kenny, have someone bring her up!

42:34.927 --> 42:37.727
- Thanks for coming in, love.
- It's all right, yeah.

42:38.447 --> 42:39.926
I couldn't believe it when I heard.

42:39.927 --> 42:41.664
His mam'll be devastated.

42:41.665 --> 42:43.146
Aye.

42:43.447 --> 42:45.926
- Um...
- Why did you want to see me?

42:45.927 --> 42:48.398
Er, because...

42:48.399 --> 42:53.826
you had a phone call with Luke
a week before he died.

42:53.927 --> 42:57.286
Um, what did you talk about?

42:57.287 --> 42:58.926
Why is that relevant?

42:58.927 --> 43:03.026
Because this is a murder enquiry, love.
Everything's relevant.

43:03.056 --> 43:05.446
In fact, you had four calls,

43:05.447 --> 43:08.586
and this last one was for over an hour.

43:08.587 --> 43:09.926
So...

43:09.927 --> 43:12.826
what did you talk about?

43:12.827 --> 43:14.286
Just... stuff.

43:14.287 --> 43:15.927
Catching up.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.140
- My wedding.
- Your wedding.

43:19.927 --> 43:22.742
Which Luke wasn't invited to,
is that right?

43:22.743 --> 43:24.927
Well, I hadn't seen him for ages.

43:25.739 --> 43:28.260
Was he upset he wasn't invited?

43:30.287 --> 43:31.926
Yeah...

43:31.927 --> 43:34.586
Yeah, but you didn't talk for an hour

43:34.587 --> 43:36.609
about a wedding he wasn't invited to.

43:36.610 --> 43:39.927
So what did you talk about?

43:41.927 --> 43:44.926
You asked if he was upset
he wasn't invited to my wedding.

43:44.927 --> 43:47.327
He was upset, full stop.

43:47.927 --> 43:50.926
We went out when we were 16.
He said he was still in love with me.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.767
He said I couldn't get married
because I was meant to marry him.

43:54.564 --> 43:57.626
- He was in love with you?
- That's what he said.

43:57.727 --> 44:01.226
He started turning up near work,
trying to talk to me, and watching me.

44:01.228 --> 44:03.926
Well, why didn't you report that?

44:03.927 --> 44:05.926
Because what good would that do?

44:05.927 --> 44:07.127
Oh...

44:07.927 --> 44:09.927
you want to know the truth?

44:10.560 --> 44:13.760
I was terrified
of what Luke might do to me.

44:26.494 --> 44:28.813
If Luke was obsessed with Jasmine,

44:28.814 --> 44:30.813
maybe he was obsessed with Nadya too.

44:30.814 --> 44:33.813
I mean, they've got to be connected,

44:33.814 --> 44:35.813
his murder and her leaving.

44:35.814 --> 44:38.333
Well, maybe he got too full-on
and Nadya attacked him?

44:38.334 --> 44:41.813
Yeah, but then we've checked, haven't we?

44:41.814 --> 44:44.814
She was working a shift for ECS
at the hospital.

44:49.814 --> 44:52.443
I couldn't believe it when I heard
Luke was dead.

44:52.444 --> 44:53.813
Same age as my Jas.

44:53.814 --> 44:55.412
Did you know him?

44:55.413 --> 44:57.521
A bit. He was a quiet boy...

44:57.522 --> 44:58.813
deep.

44:58.814 --> 45:01.333
Obviously hard for him
after his father was killed.

45:01.334 --> 45:03.813
We heard that he
used to see Jasmine.

45:03.814 --> 45:04.814
Hm.

45:06.304 --> 45:09.814
Well, she told us
that she was scared of him.

45:11.174 --> 45:13.813
To be honest, I had issues.

45:13.814 --> 45:15.713
What sort of issues?

45:15.714 --> 45:17.381
I didn't trust him.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.813
He took advantage of her
when she was vulnerable.

45:19.814 --> 45:21.813
Found his way in.

45:21.814 --> 45:23.459
What do you mean, "took advantage"?

45:23.460 --> 45:25.853
Well... after Thea died.

45:25.854 --> 45:27.813
Thea? Who's Thea?

45:27.814 --> 45:29.813
Jason Hay's daughter.

45:29.814 --> 45:32.813
Jas and Thea had been best mates
since they were little.

45:32.814 --> 45:35.813
So, were they all friends together, then,

45:35.814 --> 45:38.813
this Thea, Luke and Jasmine?

45:38.814 --> 45:39.814
Oh, no.

45:39.815 --> 45:42.713
Thea and Jas were at the girls'
school, Luke at the boys',

45:42.714 --> 45:43.951
they were very different.

45:43.952 --> 45:45.814
So, what happened with Thea?

45:46.586 --> 45:48.586
She killed herself.

45:49.814 --> 45:51.814
She was just 16.

45:52.814 --> 45:55.084
She'd told Jas she was depressed.

45:55.085 --> 45:57.529
Jas didn't realise how serious
it was, well...

45:57.530 --> 45:59.813
you don't at that age, do you?

45:59.814 --> 46:01.813
One night...

46:01.814 --> 46:04.033
Thea jumped off Jackson's Crag.

46:04.814 --> 46:06.814
Jason never recovered.

46:07.561 --> 46:09.813
How was Jasmine afterwards?

46:09.814 --> 46:10.853
Devastated.

46:10.854 --> 46:14.494
Felt guilty that she hadn't helped
Thea, hadn't stopped her.

46:15.642 --> 46:17.742
Then, Luke started coming round.

46:17.814 --> 46:20.814
Said he knew what she was going
through, 'cause of his dad.

46:21.420 --> 46:24.389
At first, I thought
he was just being kind.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.396
He was using her grief
to get to her.

46:26.397 --> 46:28.813
And once they were together,
he wouldn't leave her alone.

46:28.814 --> 46:30.813
He was here day and night.

46:30.814 --> 46:32.854
In the end, Jas had to tell him
to back off.

46:33.220 --> 46:35.813
He left Lingford a year or so later.

46:35.814 --> 46:37.813
So, when did you last hear from him?

46:37.814 --> 46:40.813
He called Jas a week or so ago.

46:40.814 --> 46:44.653
On the phone for an hour,
she said he'd called before.

46:44.654 --> 46:48.914
Jas was terrified he was
getting all intense again.

46:52.814 --> 46:58.506
So, where were you and your daughter
on the night of the 15th?

46:58.507 --> 47:01.113
- The night before Jas' school trip?
- Hm.

47:01.174 --> 47:02.813
I was here with her.

47:02.814 --> 47:04.678
She had to nip back to school,

47:04.679 --> 47:06.813
forgotten something or other.

47:06.814 --> 47:09.813
She'd been on her phone
half the night, stressing.

47:09.814 --> 47:10.814
Why?

47:10.815 --> 47:13.813
Er, just routine, love.

47:13.814 --> 47:16.639
Er, thanks very much for your time.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.214
We'll leave you to it.

47:26.234 --> 47:28.813
So, what are they saying,
that he's some kind of a stalker?

47:28.814 --> 47:30.813
No, they didn't actually
use that word.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.333
No, that's what
they meant, though!

47:32.334 --> 47:34.813
Did Luke spend time at Jasmine's
when they were younger?

47:34.814 --> 47:35.814
No!

47:35.815 --> 47:37.813
Look, I don't know.

47:37.814 --> 47:39.813
I-I can't remember.

47:39.814 --> 47:42.713
Luke, he told me that he was there

47:42.714 --> 47:45.013
because Jasmine said
she was having panic attacks.

47:45.014 --> 47:47.468
So, you remember that?

47:47.569 --> 47:50.013
Luke was not a bad lad.

47:50.014 --> 47:52.813
He was just troubled.
He broke up with her,

47:52.814 --> 47:53.814
he knew I needed him.

47:53.815 --> 47:55.693
It wasn't all about Jasmine!

47:55.694 --> 47:58.333
Hang on, he broke it off with her?

47:58.334 --> 48:00.813
That is what he said, yes.

48:00.814 --> 48:04.303
She's a pretty girl,
but not on the inside.

48:04.304 --> 48:06.813
- Were Luke, Jasmine and Thea close?
- No!

48:06.815 --> 48:09.013
They hardly gave him the time of day.

48:09.014 --> 48:12.340
Thea, she just did
whatever Jasmine told her.

48:13.814 --> 48:16.813
Look, Jasmine was popular...

48:16.814 --> 48:19.813
she didn't want to be seen with
someone like Luke.

48:19.814 --> 48:22.014
You know what
teenage girls are like.

48:23.814 --> 48:25.493
My Luke...

48:25.494 --> 48:27.498
he was a good boy.

48:27.499 --> 48:28.813
Protective.

48:28.814 --> 48:31.154
He would never have hurt Jasmine.

48:37.814 --> 48:40.813
'Ma'am, we've got
Nadya. Port authority just rang.'

48:40.814 --> 48:43.813
Thanks, Jac, we're on our way,
and can you pull up

48:43.814 --> 48:47.180
- the police report on a Thea Hay?
- 'Yes, Ma'am.'

49:02.854 --> 49:05.451
'Please ensure that
all unchecked baggage...'

49:05.452 --> 49:06.814
Nadya...

49:08.431 --> 49:09.951
Well...

49:10.334 --> 49:12.414
we've been worried about you.

49:12.814 --> 49:15.380
Why did you up and leave, Nadya?

49:17.814 --> 49:19.454
I was scared.

49:20.174 --> 49:22.414
Right, sit yourself down.

49:26.719 --> 49:28.119
Go on.

49:32.814 --> 49:35.814
OK, so let's talk about Luke.

49:36.814 --> 49:40.813
Now, I believe he'd been giving you
money to send home.

49:40.814 --> 49:43.814
So, were you together, you and Luke?

49:48.272 --> 49:50.614
We saw each other for a few months.

49:51.311 --> 49:53.371
We split up two weeks ago.

49:53.372 --> 49:55.814
So, why'd you split up?

49:56.814 --> 49:59.814
We were arguing about work,
at his flat, and

50:00.650 --> 50:04.490
he started shouting
and kicked a hole in the wardrobe.

50:04.515 --> 50:06.675
I ended it the next day.

50:06.711 --> 50:08.458
So, did he get heavy with you?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.653
No, said he didn't blame me.

50:10.654 --> 50:12.813
Not after how he behaved.

50:12.814 --> 50:14.814
So, why did you leave?

50:33.554 --> 50:35.653
Mr Brock forced me to go.

50:35.654 --> 50:38.813
He said I was bringing too much
unwanted attention to the company.

50:38.814 --> 50:40.700
Mr Brock did that?

50:45.696 --> 50:49.696
It was you who stole that cash,
wasn't it?

50:56.614 --> 50:58.813
When Luke found out
I was stealing, he...

50:58.814 --> 51:02.814
he tried to put it back, and then
they thought he'd done it.

51:03.814 --> 51:06.813
He took the blame,
but Mr Brock knew it wasn't him,

51:06.814 --> 51:08.514
knew it was me.

51:08.540 --> 51:11.813
Well, that didn't give him any right
to assault you, love.

51:11.814 --> 51:12.814
Hm?

51:18.494 --> 51:20.114
Mind your head.

51:46.334 --> 51:48.653
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding,

51:48.654 --> 51:50.310
we had nothing to do
with Luke's death.

51:50.311 --> 51:52.813
Oh, we'll get to Luke in a minute, love.

51:52.814 --> 51:56.813
Look, I've been doing some research
into your company.

51:56.814 --> 51:58.913
All the paperwork's
present and correct.

51:58.914 --> 52:01.813
Oh, you're right there,
you've been very careful.

52:01.814 --> 52:03.813
You've got certificates
for everything.

52:03.814 --> 52:07.814
But I'm willing to bet
some of them are bought.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.920
Of course they're not!

52:10.727 --> 52:13.727
'Ey, that was a good act
you put on there, love...

52:13.814 --> 52:15.813
the caring boss.

52:15.814 --> 52:19.445
Hey, you had me fooled the first time
we met, but not any more, love,

52:19.522 --> 52:22.013
not now I've seen
how you run your business.

52:22.014 --> 52:26.599
Threats, intimidation, blackmail...

52:26.600 --> 52:28.568
- We look after our staff!
- No, you don't.

52:28.569 --> 52:30.326
You do the bare minimum.

52:30.327 --> 52:33.813
Apart from your houses,
when you do even less.

52:33.814 --> 52:36.574
I doubt they meet occupancy standard.

52:37.974 --> 52:40.068
There's a couple
that are a little busy,

52:40.069 --> 52:41.493
but we're buying more houses.

52:41.494 --> 52:43.584
I can't put staff out on the street!

52:43.585 --> 52:46.173
Er, none of your rooms are
registered for multi-occupancy.

52:46.174 --> 52:49.813
Yet, all 12 of your houses
are crammed to the gills.

52:49.814 --> 52:52.813
We had a cash flow problem,
but we were working on it,

52:52.814 --> 52:54.413
I've had electricians in.

52:54.437 --> 52:57.736
Yeah, 'cause you knew you were on
our radar, you knew we'd be checking.

52:57.814 --> 52:59.813
Now, then

52:59.814 --> 53:02.813
your husband did this 2 days ago,

53:02.814 --> 53:05.814
removing someone from your property.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.788
He did this?

53:14.814 --> 53:17.256
Oh, I didn't know...

53:17.257 --> 53:19.813
This has got nothing to do with me.

53:19.814 --> 53:21.814
Are you sure about that, love?

53:27.654 --> 53:31.814
Now, there is one way you could
help yourself here, pet.

53:33.014 --> 53:35.814
And that's if you help us with Luke.

53:36.814 --> 53:40.173
So, what else is it
you're not telling us, hmm?

53:41.640 --> 53:44.220
Something did happen with Luke,
but he wouldn't tell me what.

53:44.814 --> 53:47.333
You'll have to talk to Clive.

53:47.334 --> 53:50.076
I brought Luke in for the stealing,
I-I knew it wasn't him,

53:50.077 --> 53:51.813
he was covering
for his girlfriend.

53:51.814 --> 53:54.076
But when I got him in,
he insisted it was him.

53:54.077 --> 53:55.813
Got arsey, threatened us.

53:55.814 --> 53:57.180
Threatened you with what?

53:58.814 --> 54:01.813
Nah, Luke had worked for you
long enough to know

54:01.814 --> 54:04.813
all the ins and outs, all the shortcuts.

54:04.814 --> 54:07.333
That's why he had his own flat,
for a start.

54:07.334 --> 54:09.813
You were scared how much he knew.

54:09.814 --> 54:10.814
Ridiculous.

54:10.815 --> 54:13.178
These are completely unsubstantiated
claims.

54:13.179 --> 54:15.813
So, what happened, did he offer
to turn a blind eye

54:15.814 --> 54:17.568
if you did the same?

54:17.569 --> 54:19.076
We agreed not to pursue the matter,

54:19.077 --> 54:22.493
because the cash had been returned
and no-one was hurt.

54:22.494 --> 54:24.285
But recently, he'd got cocky.

54:24.286 --> 54:26.813
Turning up late, talking back.

54:26.814 --> 54:29.493
- Sets the wrong example.
- The wrong example?!

54:29.494 --> 54:31.813
I wasn't having him make a mug out of me.

54:31.814 --> 54:34.813
Oh, is that what he did,
made a mug out of you?

54:34.814 --> 54:36.813
Well, you wouldn't have liked that.

54:36.814 --> 54:38.813
So, what did he do,
push you too far,

54:38.814 --> 54:42.813
you had to shut him up? Because
I believe you are capable of it!

54:42.814 --> 54:45.170
I had nothing to do with Luke's murder.

54:45.171 --> 54:46.493
So YOU say.

54:46.494 --> 54:48.813
Do you have any evidence
my client was involved?

54:48.814 --> 54:50.178
Not yet.

54:50.179 --> 54:53.813
In that case, as Mr Brock has
assisted fully in your enquiries,

54:53.814 --> 54:55.013
he now has work to do.

54:55.014 --> 54:57.813
Ah, no, your client's going nowhere,
love.

54:57.814 --> 54:59.568
Sit down, pet.

54:59.569 --> 55:02.813
Because I have a witness
making a formal complaint

55:02.814 --> 55:05.814
- at this very moment.
- What about?

55:06.103 --> 55:07.303
Assault.

55:14.814 --> 55:16.713
This is totally ridiculous.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.260
Just keep calm,
we'll sort it out.

55:21.119 --> 55:22.482
I hate to say it,

55:22.483 --> 55:25.813
but I don't think either of 'em had
anything to do with Luke's death.

55:25.814 --> 55:29.393
And they wouldn't do anything
to bring us to their doorstep.

55:29.394 --> 55:30.707
But we can't rule them out!

55:30.708 --> 55:33.113
I'm not ruling anybody out!

55:33.815 --> 55:36.813
Now, Luke suddenly started fighting back,

55:36.814 --> 55:38.813
after two years of towing the line.

55:38.814 --> 55:41.813
So, something happened recently
to make him start.

55:41.814 --> 55:45.260
Hm? That's what we need to find out.

55:51.814 --> 55:53.654
Good lass.

55:55.814 --> 55:57.014
Please!

55:58.814 --> 56:01.214
It wasn't fair,
what I said about Luke.

56:01.420 --> 56:04.014
He was ashamed for losing his temper.

56:04.814 --> 56:08.053
Well, you thought if he'd done it
the once...

56:08.054 --> 56:10.813
No, he-he wasn't like that.

56:10.814 --> 56:12.154
He was...

56:12.173 --> 56:13.833
kind and gentle.

56:14.814 --> 56:17.214
I don't think he'd had a happy life.

56:18.727 --> 56:20.927
A couple of weeks before we split up,

56:21.016 --> 56:23.216
he had a day off and

56:23.814 --> 56:26.254
the next day, he was different.

56:26.358 --> 56:28.254
In what way different?

56:28.660 --> 56:30.701
He'd changed, he...

56:30.702 --> 56:33.014
avoided me, made excuses.

56:34.814 --> 56:38.300
Went to the pub and got drunk
after every shift.

56:38.325 --> 56:40.420
I just gave him some space.

56:41.556 --> 56:44.556
Now, during our examinations,

56:44.735 --> 56:47.095
we found scars on Luke's legs,

56:47.120 --> 56:48.800
old scars,

56:49.060 --> 56:51.607
did you ever notice them?

56:51.632 --> 56:53.813
Yeah. I saw him in the shower once,

56:53.814 --> 56:56.814
scrubbing himself with a brush
until it bled.

56:57.814 --> 56:59.713
It hurt him.

56:59.814 --> 57:01.814
The bathroom smelled of bleach
after that.

57:03.382 --> 57:04.813
Did he do that often?

57:04.814 --> 57:07.014
I only saw him do it once.

57:08.814 --> 57:11.114
I really liked him, you know?

57:14.814 --> 57:18.333
I looked into Jasmine Ashers'
fiance, a Richard Sarenden,

57:18.334 --> 57:22.813
he was the keynote speaker
in Belfast on the 15th.

57:22.814 --> 57:24.913
So, with a room full of witnesses?

57:24.914 --> 57:26.600
Yeah, 300 of them.

57:29.507 --> 57:33.814
You know, Nadya's Luke couldn't be
more different from Jasmine's.

57:34.380 --> 57:36.913
Doesn't sound like
he preyed on the vulnerable.

57:36.914 --> 57:38.120
Hm...

57:38.626 --> 57:41.920
See if you can find out
when his day off was.

57:44.673 --> 57:46.873
That part of your training, is it?

57:52.814 --> 57:53.814
Ma'am...

57:53.815 --> 57:57.173
Luke's bank card was handed in by
a Phil Annerly yesterday lunchtime,

57:57.174 --> 57:59.813
but he found it on the evening
of the 15th.

57:59.814 --> 58:02.240
That's the night Luke died.
Where did they find it?

58:02.241 --> 58:05.514
At his pub, The Brickmakers Arms,
he's the landlord.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.814
Luke went there
after walking off his shift.

58:20.814 --> 58:24.333
I found his card in the toilet,
the other night.

58:24.334 --> 58:28.396
I thought I'd hold onto it in case
he came back, but he never showed.

58:28.397 --> 58:29.913
And you're sure
it was the 15th?

58:29.914 --> 58:32.653
Oh, aye, we had the football on.

58:32.654 --> 58:34.514
Place was busy.

58:34.515 --> 58:37.720
He came in about, what,
20 minutes beforehand.

58:38.665 --> 58:41.665
It'll be on CCTV,
if you want to come through.

58:41.690 --> 58:43.530
He should be on it.

58:49.614 --> 58:50.814
There we go.

58:50.815 --> 58:53.114
There he is, there's our lad.

58:56.814 --> 58:58.634
That's Raymond Kayle!

58:59.334 --> 59:01.814
You've gotta be kidding me!

59:04.014 --> 59:05.813
Is Raymond a regular?

59:05.814 --> 59:08.460
This is his local,
he's in here most nights.

59:09.696 --> 59:11.720
I've not seen him this week,
though.

59:14.688 --> 59:16.740
- That through to the gents'?
- Aye.

59:17.814 --> 59:20.354
Is there an exit
through the back there?

59:20.596 --> 59:22.076
Aye.

59:36.743 --> 59:39.043
Er, you need to come out, love.

59:48.614 --> 59:50.006
He could've
got out this way.

59:50.007 --> 59:52.360
Aye, or been taken out.

59:52.914 --> 59:54.813
Er, can I get you a coffee?

59:54.814 --> 59:56.813
Hey, don't come in here, pet,

59:56.814 --> 59:58.813
it's a possible crime scene.

59:58.814 --> 01:00:00.333
Well, shall I close the pub up?

01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:01.814
Aye, you better had, love.

01:00:03.494 --> 01:00:04.654
Right.

01:00:19.174 --> 01:00:20.914
This lock's broken.

01:00:21.814 --> 01:00:24.214
Anybody could've
come in and gone out.

01:00:27.814 --> 01:00:30.334
Ma'am, look, fibres.

01:00:31.384 --> 01:00:33.704
- That could be from Luke's T-shirt.
- Hm.

01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:37.177
Maybe Raymond assaulted him here,
then dragged him out?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.380
Or Luke could've just left by himself.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.201
And if so, where'd he go?

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.610
Right, get it sealed off
and get forensics in.

01:00:51.174 --> 01:00:53.513
Jac, now, listen...

01:00:53.814 --> 01:00:57.521
Luke left the pub after 7:45PM,

01:00:57.522 --> 01:00:58.813
but we don't know where he went.

01:00:58.814 --> 01:01:02.813
So, I'm gonna need uniform
to canvas the area.

01:01:02.814 --> 01:01:04.853
<i>He could have gone anywhere.</i>

01:01:04.854 --> 01:01:06.813
<i>Have you got that?</i>

01:01:06.814 --> 01:01:08.220
I'm on it, Ma'am.

01:01:28.654 --> 01:01:29.813
Raymond...

01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:34.014
you should've told us you saw Luke
on the night he died.

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:42.373
You knew Luke would be in your local,

01:01:42.374 --> 01:01:44.893
you knew everyone'd be
watching the football,

01:01:44.894 --> 01:01:47.273
- and you went there to hurt him.
- No...

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:49.373
Take it out on him for your
brother not being released!

01:01:49.374 --> 01:01:51.982
- No! No, I didn't.
- You've told us a pack of lies!

01:01:51.983 --> 01:01:54.224
You told us you
hadn't spoken to Luke.

01:01:54.225 --> 01:01:56.373
I avoided him at work,
I got him moved.

01:01:56.374 --> 01:01:58.053
But he door-stepped me.

01:01:58.054 --> 01:01:59.373
He wanted to talk.

01:01:59.374 --> 01:02:01.373
He knew Terry's parole was coming up.

01:02:01.374 --> 01:02:04.373
Luke actually believed
it WAS self-defence.

01:02:04.374 --> 01:02:05.374
Are you buying this?

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:08.373
Are you expecting us to believe
he wanted to help your brother,

01:02:08.374 --> 01:02:10.373
who'd killed his dad?

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:12.574
Luke was terrified of his dad.

01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:14.373
Seth made his life a misery.

01:02:14.374 --> 01:02:16.733
He-he used to knocked him about,
and his mam.

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:19.373
That's why Luke wanted to help me.

01:02:19.374 --> 01:02:21.733
It was his idea that I talk to Carmel.

01:02:21.734 --> 01:02:23.733
He made me think
that she might actually listen.

01:02:23.734 --> 01:02:26.373
Yeah, yeah, we know all about that.
I wanna know what happened

01:02:26.374 --> 01:02:28.068
on the night he died!

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:31.373
CCTV from The Brickmakers Arms shows
you arguing with him that night.

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:35.014
You went to that pub to find Luke
and to attack him!

01:02:35.015 --> 01:02:37.170
No, he was waiting for me.

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:39.373
He knew it was me regular,
he wanted to talk.

01:02:39.374 --> 01:02:41.673
Yeah, well, that doesn't look
much like talking to me, pet.

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:44.006
He said he was
sorry about Terry.

01:02:44.007 --> 01:02:46.053
Me talking to his mam
had only made it worse.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.373
I told him to go away,
just leave us alone.

01:02:47.374 --> 01:02:50.373
No, you went to the gents',
where it's a bit more private,

01:02:50.374 --> 01:02:53.170
- 'cause you knew he'd follow you.
- I didn't know he'd come after me!

01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:55.733
And once you'd got him in there,
you attacked him.

01:02:55.734 --> 01:02:58.373
No, I didn't!
That's not how it happened.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:02.273
Look, he said he blamed me
for Terry not getting his parole,

01:03:02.274 --> 01:03:04.373
that it was my fault,
that I hadn't tried hard enough.

01:03:04.374 --> 01:03:07.374
He was goading me, so I hit him!

01:03:11.303 --> 01:03:13.523
I lost control!

01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:16.473
I never should have, but at least
I only hit him the once.

01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:18.740
- And the rest!
- Once.

01:03:20.374 --> 01:03:22.034
I didn't kill him.

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:27.257
I know how it looks, but, I mean,
why do you think I lied?

01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:31.896
Right, so, just let me
get this straight.

01:03:31.897 --> 01:03:34.373
You're telling us, for the tape,

01:03:34.374 --> 01:03:36.840
that you only threw one punch?

01:03:37.649 --> 01:03:38.809
Yeah.

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:41.991
OK.

01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:45.639
Where'd you hit him?

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.274
Ribs.

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:51.374
I lost control, but only for a second.

01:03:53.374 --> 01:03:57.020
I was so disappointed in myself,
I left him and went back to the gym.

01:03:57.514 --> 01:03:59.740
It was weird...

01:04:01.374 --> 01:04:03.373
after I hit him...

01:04:03.374 --> 01:04:05.373
he seemed pleased.

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:07.006
Said he deserved it.

01:04:07.007 --> 01:04:09.220
Were you wearing those that night?

01:04:11.374 --> 01:04:12.820
Your rings?

01:04:14.155 --> 01:04:15.373
Yeah...

01:04:15.374 --> 01:04:17.413
I always wear 'em
when I'm not working out,

01:04:17.414 --> 01:04:19.373
- they were me dad's.
- Mm.

01:04:19.374 --> 01:04:20.880
Right, well, take 'em off.

01:04:21.374 --> 01:04:22.374
What?

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:24.114
Take 'em off.

01:04:29.274 --> 01:04:30.374
That's it.

01:04:30.374 --> 01:04:31.374
Hm.

01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:37.076
God help you if you're lying to me, love.

01:04:37.077 --> 01:04:38.674
Take him back down.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.280
Raymond has admitted to the assault,
but not the head injury.

01:04:46.305 --> 01:04:50.305
Aye, but he claims he only punched
the lad once, so we need evidence.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.970
Now the rings have
gone over to Malcolm

01:04:52.994 --> 01:04:56.853
to see if they match this blow
to Luke's torso.

01:04:57.374 --> 01:05:01.060
Right, now, has anybody
got anything else?

01:05:01.061 --> 01:05:03.474
Uh, the forensic report
is just in, Ma'am.

01:05:05.374 --> 01:05:07.373
Uh, Luke's fingerprints were found

01:05:07.374 --> 01:05:10.893
on the emergency exit door
and on the back gate.

01:05:10.894 --> 01:05:13.373
The rest of it's just a mess
of DNA and prints.

01:05:13.374 --> 01:05:16.273
Which means he got himself
out of that pub?

01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:17.498
Looks like it.

01:05:17.499 --> 01:05:21.373
Which means, the crime scene
is somewhere else.

01:05:21.574 --> 01:05:25.373
Any ideas, anyone,
where he might've gone?

01:05:25.374 --> 01:05:28.132
I haven't seen him on CCTV.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.014
But then again,
there's not much out there.

01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:32.373
Oh, there are some bus stops
nearby though.

01:05:32.374 --> 01:05:35.373
He could've had his pick of
15 buses after leaving the pub.

01:05:35.374 --> 01:05:37.573
Aye, well that makes sense.

01:05:37.574 --> 01:05:40.374
He would've wanted
to get away from there.

01:05:41.734 --> 01:05:45.373
And if he's on a bus, that would
explain why he's not on any CCTV.

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.131
Good thinking, Jac.

01:05:47.132 --> 01:05:48.209
Right.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:53.893
Go talk to the drivers, get their
CCTV and take uniform with you.

01:05:53.894 --> 01:05:56.374
I'm gonna go and chivvy Malcolm on.

01:05:58.374 --> 01:06:02.374
Right, come on, everyone,
I want some news when I get back!

01:06:04.374 --> 01:06:09.951
I would say that these abrasions on
Luke's torso are related to ring A.

01:06:09.952 --> 01:06:12.131
- That's the right hand.
- That's correct.

01:06:12.132 --> 01:06:15.373
But there is no evidence that
he caused any of the other injuries,

01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:18.213
including the one to the head.

01:06:18.214 --> 01:06:20.373
There's no sign of any more
ring abrasions at all.

01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:21.717
What, none?!

01:06:21.718 --> 01:06:24.374
None. I had expected to see some,
but there's nothing.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:29.139
So you're saying,
Luke was assaulted twice?

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.373
First by Raymond,
and then by somebody else.

01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:34.374
Looking at the evidence,
I can't link him to the fatal blow.

01:06:34.749 --> 01:06:37.749
The head injury
was within the next five hours.

01:06:41.374 --> 01:06:43.273
Thanks, Malcolm.

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:46.373
Oh, there was one more thing.

01:06:46.374 --> 01:06:50.373
I did re-examine
the historical scars on Luke's body,

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:52.373
and they do match
what you were told.

01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:54.373
It's very likely that he was alternating

01:06:54.374 --> 01:06:57.473
between using a nail brush
and bleach on himself.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:02.574
He'd done it twice in the last year,
the others were older.

01:07:03.898 --> 01:07:05.058
Hm.

01:07:08.374 --> 01:07:12.373
- Yes, I know Raymond has, previous.
- And he lied to us...

01:07:12.374 --> 01:07:15.373
True, but I can't link him
to that fatal blow to the head.

01:07:15.374 --> 01:07:17.068
You can't believe him?

01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:21.373
Look, Luke was deep waters
like his mam said.

01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:23.373
Hmm? He was troubled, intense,

01:07:23.374 --> 01:07:25.373
and if what Raymond said is true,

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:29.374
his dad was a brute
and that messes with your head.

01:07:33.374 --> 01:07:37.374
Luke wanted to be punished, felt guilty.

01:07:38.374 --> 01:07:39.974
For what? Hm?

01:07:46.174 --> 01:07:48.573
Right, now, how we doing
with these bus drivers?

01:07:48.574 --> 01:07:50.373
Anyone see him?

01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:52.074
I'll go check.

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:58.241
- And you're sure this is the fella?
- Yeah.

01:07:58.266 --> 01:07:59.886
How did he seem?

01:07:59.894 --> 01:08:03.373
Some lads were hassling him
and I warned them off.

01:08:03.374 --> 01:08:06.373
He looked in a state.
Got off at the Walton Crossroads.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:08.373
It's a stop in the middle of nowhere,

01:08:08.374 --> 01:08:10.374
about 18 miles from here.

01:08:10.945 --> 01:08:13.645
That's 2 miles from Lingford!

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.076
We suspect that Luke
was in Lingford the night he died.

01:08:23.077 --> 01:08:25.234
He got a bus to Walton Crossroads.

01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:28.361
Well, he didn't want to see me.

01:08:29.264 --> 01:08:33.163
Last time that I saw Luke we argued.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.173
I argued.

01:08:35.374 --> 01:08:39.840
I was angry that he'd brought
Raymond to my door, to my home.

01:08:41.233 --> 01:08:45.233
Well, we do know there was
something going on with Luke.

01:08:45.258 --> 01:08:49.258
Something he blamed himself for,
felt guilty about.

01:08:49.283 --> 01:08:51.962
Have you got any idea
what that could've been?

01:08:53.374 --> 01:08:55.273
Terence Kayle.

01:08:55.374 --> 01:08:59.803
Luke wanted me to say
that his dad was violent.

01:08:59.804 --> 01:09:02.997
That Terence
could've been defending himself.

01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:08.094
Well, we had heard that your husband
was violent towards Luke

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:11.033
and to yourself.

01:09:13.037 --> 01:09:15.877
Seth never meant to hurt us.

01:09:15.903 --> 01:09:19.063
I tried to stop him,
but it just made it worse.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:21.087
So it was better to say nothing.

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:23.920
Luke and me would both learn that.

01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:29.162
I know I should've protected Luke.

01:09:31.185 --> 01:09:33.819
His dad was not all bad.

01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:37.540
He was always sorry afterwards.

01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:41.580
And you loved him, hm?

01:09:44.374 --> 01:09:46.473
But you've got to be honest, pet.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.514
Especially to yourself.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.314
Luke said that.

01:09:52.894 --> 01:09:55.454
Said that we had to tell the truth.

01:09:56.265 --> 01:09:59.465
If we didn't, neither of us
would be able to move on.

01:10:00.374 --> 01:10:02.574
Wise words, pet.

01:10:07.952 --> 01:10:10.460
Er, hold on.

01:10:12.738 --> 01:10:15.218
When Luke last came to see you,

01:10:15.243 --> 01:10:18.243
is that when he found out
about Jasmine's wedding?

01:10:18.374 --> 01:10:21.373
Yeah. I asked him to come with me.
I thought he'd like it.

01:10:21.374 --> 01:10:23.420
And what did he say?

01:10:23.445 --> 01:10:26.700
No. He was really upset.

01:10:26.894 --> 01:10:29.373
He left soon afterwards.

01:10:29.374 --> 01:10:32.374
Told me to think about what he said.

01:10:35.374 --> 01:10:37.374
Well, thank you for your help.

01:10:43.174 --> 01:10:45.373
Do you reckon that Luke
was attacked in Lingford?

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.990
Aye, it'd mean he would've had
4 hours to get back home.

01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:49.123
Wouldn't he?

01:10:49.124 --> 01:10:52.373
And you heard what Malcolm said,
he was a dead man walking.

01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:53.374
Hm.

01:10:54.858 --> 01:10:56.440
And another thing...

01:10:57.952 --> 01:11:01.060
Didn't Nadya say
Luke changed 4 weeks ago,

01:11:01.095 --> 01:11:02.555
completely changed?

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.340
Yeah, I checked on that. That was
the day after he came to see his mum.

01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:09.110
Aye, but the big thing that happened
that day wasn't about Raymond,

01:11:09.135 --> 01:11:12.195
it was finding out
Jasmine was getting married.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.680
Well, maybe he
came to see Jasmine.

01:11:13.705 --> 01:11:15.445
Could still have been
obsessed with her?

01:11:15.474 --> 01:11:17.373
- Aye. What you doing?
- What?

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.993
Come on,
I thought you was in training.

01:11:18.994 --> 01:11:20.573
It's only around the corner.

01:11:28.374 --> 01:11:29.733
Mrs Ashers.

01:11:29.734 --> 01:11:33.373
Let's talk again
about the night of the 15th.

01:11:33.374 --> 01:11:36.373
Did you see Luke?

01:11:36.374 --> 01:11:37.974
Of course not. Why would I?

01:11:37.975 --> 01:11:41.373
'Cause he got off a bus,
not 2 miles from here,

01:11:41.374 --> 01:11:43.373
and that's the night he died.

01:11:43.374 --> 01:11:46.373
Now, you said Jasmine went to work.

01:11:46.374 --> 01:11:48.373
Well, it's a bit of a coincidence,

01:11:48.374 --> 01:11:52.373
she went out round about the
same time as he arrived in the area.

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:55.060
Hmm? I think she went to meet him...

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.631
Why would she do that?
She was scared of him!

01:11:57.632 --> 01:12:00.373
- She, she wouldn't.
- What time did she get back?

01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:03.373
- I don't know, I went to bed.
- Well, what time did you go to bed?

01:12:03.374 --> 01:12:04.374
Ten?

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:07.053
Jas couldn't have been much later.
She had an early start.

01:12:07.054 --> 01:12:09.170
She can't have seen him,
she'd have said.

01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:11.673
Ah, and kids tell their parents
everything, do they?

01:12:11.674 --> 01:12:14.733
I don't know about other parents,
but we do!

01:12:14.734 --> 01:12:17.373
I didn't want Luke
anywhere near Jas.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:18.374
He was dangerous.

01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:20.373
We couldn't have
a repeat of last time.

01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:24.373
And that gives her, and you,
a motive to hurt him.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:25.934
Doesn't it?

01:12:28.374 --> 01:12:30.373
Yeah, Jac, listen.

01:12:30.374 --> 01:12:34.029
I want you to run an ANPR
on Jasmine Ashers' car,

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.373
and her mam's, too.

01:12:35.374 --> 01:12:36.654
On it.

01:12:36.655 --> 01:12:40.053
Oh, Ma'am, I've just heard back
from Woodrow Academy.

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:42.473
Er, Jasmine's pass card wasn't used
on the night of the 15th.

01:12:42.474 --> 01:12:44.953
And no printers were used.

01:12:45.054 --> 01:12:48.373
And CCTV shows
nobody entering or leaving.

01:12:48.374 --> 01:12:50.374
So she lied.

01:12:51.132 --> 01:12:52.440
Thanks, Jac!

01:12:53.241 --> 01:12:56.241
Right, this is starting to make sense.

01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:15.373
Jasmine Ashers, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

01:13:15.374 --> 01:13:16.413
of Luke Sumner.

01:13:16.414 --> 01:13:19.373
- You do not have to say anything...
- What? But I haven't done anything.

01:13:19.374 --> 01:13:22.373
if you do not mention something
you later rely on in court.

01:13:22.374 --> 01:13:23.513
- What?
- Anything you do say

01:13:23.538 --> 01:13:26.054
may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?

01:13:30.634 --> 01:13:33.892
- Now why'd you lie about seeing Luke?
- I didn't.

01:13:33.897 --> 01:13:38.254
Oh, stop playing the innocent, love,
it won't wash. We know you saw him.

01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:41.373
And when we run your fingerprints
through our system,

01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:44.240
I'm pretty sure they're gonna
match those we found at his flat.

01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:46.990
ANPR shows 5 days before Luke died,

01:13:46.991 --> 01:13:50.053
your car passed 200 metres from his home.

01:13:50.054 --> 01:13:54.357
And then, 30 minutes later,
it passed in the opposite direction.

01:13:54.358 --> 01:13:57.068
Plus, we have a statement
from a neighbour,

01:13:57.069 --> 01:13:59.373
saying she heard an argument
in Luke's flat

01:13:59.374 --> 01:14:02.748
at the time between these 2 readings.

01:14:02.749 --> 01:14:06.170
Now, you say
he was obsessed with you,

01:14:06.171 --> 01:14:10.100
well, we never found any photos
or anything in his flat.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:15.373
And 4 phone calls in 4 weeks,
that's hardly evidence of stalking.

01:14:15.374 --> 01:14:19.373
And the last time you saw him,
you went to his!

01:14:19.374 --> 01:14:24.173
So will you stop lying
and start telling us the truth!

01:14:24.374 --> 01:14:26.413
You didn't know him like I did.

01:14:26.414 --> 01:14:28.373
He was intense and scary.

01:14:28.374 --> 01:14:31.373
Well, from what we can gather

01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:33.373
he was a hard-working,
troubled young man

01:14:33.374 --> 01:14:35.724
who helped those
who were vulnerable! So...

01:14:35.725 --> 01:14:37.084
It wasn't like that.

01:14:37.085 --> 01:14:38.894
So what was it like?

01:14:39.663 --> 01:14:42.373
After Thea, he said he understood
how I felt 'cause of his dad.

01:14:42.374 --> 01:14:44.373
Said the grief bonded us.

01:14:44.374 --> 01:14:47.213
I was upset, all over the place.

01:14:47.214 --> 01:14:49.053
Next thing I know, we're going out,

01:14:49.054 --> 01:14:50.893
but he wanted to be with me
all the time.

01:14:50.894 --> 01:14:53.373
I could hardly breathe.
I had panic attacks.

01:14:53.374 --> 01:14:55.574
Well, that could be guilt about Thea.

01:14:56.174 --> 01:14:57.733
What, what do you mean?

01:14:57.734 --> 01:15:01.373
Well, weren't you the only one
she told she was depressed?

01:15:01.374 --> 01:15:05.213
Well, yeah, and I did try to help her.

01:15:05.214 --> 01:15:08.373
But she'd started smoking weed
heavily, only it made her worse.

01:15:08.374 --> 01:15:10.373
I told her to stop,
but she wouldn't listen.

01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:13.574
So why is there no mention
of that in the report?

01:15:14.374 --> 01:15:16.373
I didn't want to upset
her dad and sister.

01:15:16.374 --> 01:15:19.374
Well, that wasn't your decision
to make, love.

01:15:19.944 --> 01:15:24.373
Now, I think Luke got back in touch
with you, came to Lingford...

01:15:24.374 --> 01:15:27.373
Well, maybe he was jealous you were
getting married, I don't know.

01:15:27.374 --> 01:15:31.374
and you arranged to meet him,
to warn him off.

01:15:33.007 --> 01:15:35.373
So what happened, love, eh?

01:15:35.374 --> 01:15:40.053
Did he say something wrong?
Things escalate and you lashed out.

01:15:40.054 --> 01:15:41.573
I didn't. I didn't!

01:15:41.574 --> 01:15:44.733
So where were you then,
on the night he died?

01:15:44.734 --> 01:15:48.513
And don't tell us you went into school,
love, because we know you didn't.

01:15:49.374 --> 01:15:51.373
Where were you, Jasmine?

01:15:51.374 --> 01:15:52.374
Hmm?

01:15:54.265 --> 01:15:55.865
I was with someone.

01:15:56.414 --> 01:15:58.274
He's married.

01:15:58.937 --> 01:16:00.937
Luke was blackmailing me.

01:16:01.374 --> 01:16:04.374
That's why I went to see him.
He'd followed me, and saw us together.

01:16:04.374 --> 01:16:08.006
Oh, first obsession, now blackmail?

01:16:08.007 --> 01:16:11.374
He said if I didn't meet him,
he'd tell my fiance.

01:16:12.937 --> 01:16:14.937
Right, a married man.

01:16:15.374 --> 01:16:18.374
Come on, details,
name and address, please?

01:16:20.974 --> 01:16:23.373
I can see why she wanted
to keep it quiet.

01:16:23.374 --> 01:16:25.373
He's Chair of the Governors
at her Academy.

01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:27.373
They've been together
for 6 months.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:29.373
He's married with 3 kids,
all under 5.

01:16:29.374 --> 01:16:36.073
Now, the CCTV on his road shows
Jasmine arriving at 9:10PM

01:16:36.374 --> 01:16:39.373
and leaving at 10:36PM.

01:16:39.374 --> 01:16:41.373
His wife and kids were away.

01:16:41.374 --> 01:16:44.374
He's paranoid his missus
is gonna find out.

01:16:45.374 --> 01:16:49.374
Well, if she's got an alibi,
we're gonna have to let her go.

01:16:50.053 --> 01:16:52.053
But the girl is a liar.

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:55.373
Luke was way too busy
to go stalking her.

01:16:55.374 --> 01:16:58.576
But it was her wedding
that unsettled him.

01:16:58.577 --> 01:17:00.474
Hmm? We know that much.

01:17:01.374 --> 01:17:05.060
And then he goes back to work,
shuts himself off,

01:17:05.061 --> 01:17:07.374
and starts to unravel.

01:17:12.014 --> 01:17:15.014
Where's Thea Hay's
toxicology report?

01:17:22.108 --> 01:17:24.108
We need to see Malcolm.

01:17:30.374 --> 01:17:32.174
Er, Malcolm!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.373
I'm in the middle of a supervision.

01:17:38.374 --> 01:17:40.733
Yeah, and I'm in the middle
of a murder enquiry.

01:17:40.734 --> 01:17:42.373
Take a look at that.

01:17:42.374 --> 01:17:43.413
It's about Luke Sumner.

01:17:43.414 --> 01:17:45.896
Well, why have you given me this?
It says Thea Hay on it.

01:17:45.897 --> 01:17:47.732
Yes, I know it does.

01:17:47.733 --> 01:17:50.327
Now, she grew up in
the same village as Luke,

01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:51.795
- killed herself.
- Right.

01:17:51.796 --> 01:17:55.074
Take a look at the toxicology report.

01:17:57.738 --> 01:18:00.218
Now her best friend has just told us,

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:04.923
that Thea was a heavy cannabis user
before she died, hmm?

01:18:04.948 --> 01:18:07.268
There's no mention of that in there.

01:18:07.293 --> 01:18:09.020
Well, why would there be,
if that wasn't the case?

01:18:09.045 --> 01:18:12.045
Well, is it possible
she just didn't use on day she died?

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:14.890
Traces of THC
stay in the body for 30 days.

01:18:14.894 --> 01:18:18.373
I would say, that this girl had,
at most, one joint in her system.

01:18:18.374 --> 01:18:20.373
And they only found
the one butt at the scene.

01:18:20.374 --> 01:18:22.834
Her father said that she
never smoked, rarely drank.

01:18:22.921 --> 01:18:24.959
There was no alcohol
found in her body either.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.214
And no suicide note.

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.199
- Anytime
- Thank you, Malcolm.

01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:31.920
Sorry about that.

01:18:31.945 --> 01:18:35.785
Now, when was Luke cautioned
for cannabis possession?

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:37.200
6 weeks before Thea died.

01:18:37.225 --> 01:18:38.660
Right, now listen...

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.349
See, I think all of Luke's self-harming

01:18:42.374 --> 01:18:46.574
and all the rest of it,
was because of Thea's death

01:18:47.574 --> 01:18:51.574
and I don't think that lass
was alone when she died!

01:18:59.937 --> 01:19:02.936
It was Thea's death
that bonded Luke and Jasmine.

01:19:02.937 --> 01:19:05.936
Because they were both with her
when she died!

01:19:05.937 --> 01:19:09.456
And whilst Luke spent his life
tormented by the memory,

01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:13.936
there's Jasmine gaily making wedding
plans as if nothing had happened.

01:19:13.937 --> 01:19:15.467
ANPR have confirmed

01:19:15.468 --> 01:19:18.396
Jason Hay's vehicle
was sighted at Ayrton Road,

01:19:18.397 --> 01:19:20.456
at 23:45 on the 15th.

01:19:20.457 --> 01:19:23.936
Right... see, Luke needed
the truth to come out

01:19:23.937 --> 01:19:26.638
and I think he gave Jasmine an ultimatum.

01:19:26.639 --> 01:19:28.412
Tell the truth with me or I do it alone?

01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:32.937
Aye. He went to Lingford
to confess to Thea's dad!

01:19:41.937 --> 01:19:45.474
- Police are here for you, Dad.
- Oh, what now?

01:19:45.475 --> 01:19:48.936
Er, look can we have a word with
your dad, in private, love?

01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:51.326
I told you about Kayle.
Should've arrested him by now!

01:19:51.327 --> 01:19:53.936
We're not here to talk about
Raymond Kayle, pet.

01:19:53.937 --> 01:19:56.137
We want to talk about Thea.

01:19:56.837 --> 01:19:58.936
- Thea?
- Aye.

01:19:58.937 --> 01:20:00.506
Well, what do you
want to know?

01:20:00.507 --> 01:20:04.936
Well, can you tell us a bit more
about the night your daughter died.

01:20:04.937 --> 01:20:06.416
Hmm?

01:20:06.617 --> 01:20:08.800
Just so as we're clear.

01:20:12.617 --> 01:20:14.937
She seemed really happy the day she died.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.977
I thought we'd had a nice day.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.560
We watched a film...

01:20:21.397 --> 01:20:23.397
we went to bed

01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.460
then, in the middle of the night,
she just crept out

01:20:28.155 --> 01:20:30.355
walked to Jackson's Crag.

01:20:32.233 --> 01:20:34.233
It was depression.

01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:37.069
I had no idea.

01:20:38.937 --> 01:20:43.780
I play it over and over,
about how I could've stopped her.

01:20:44.937 --> 01:20:47.521
About why I didn't spot it.

01:20:47.522 --> 01:20:49.837
Working out why she didn't tell me.

01:20:49.937 --> 01:20:51.936
Was it because she was too proud?

01:20:51.937 --> 01:20:54.036
Was it because
she was too ashamed?

01:20:54.037 --> 01:20:56.437
Was it because her mam left
when she was little?

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.400
I'll never forgive myself for missing it.

01:21:03.187 --> 01:21:04.647
Mr Hay...

01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:10.937
we know Luke Sumner came
to Lingford on the night he died.

01:21:11.359 --> 01:21:12.819
Did he?

01:21:13.812 --> 01:21:16.812
- Why?  - Well, we're hoping
you could tell us that

01:21:16.837 --> 01:21:19.837
'cause we believe
he came to see you.

01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:22.776
Well, I... I wouldn't know if he did.

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.817
I'd been in the pub.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.936
Doesn't mix with my meds.

01:21:26.937 --> 01:21:31.349
The landlord sent me home,
I was in bed asleep by half 7.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:32.678
Can anyone verify that?

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.936
- What?
- Could Georgia?

01:21:34.937 --> 01:21:39.300
She was doing a double shift
at her care home. She slept over.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:42.136
How does she get
to and from work?

01:21:42.137 --> 01:21:45.137
She uses my car.
I can't drive it. I...

01:21:46.146 --> 01:21:47.646
lost my license.

01:21:47.671 --> 01:21:49.171
Why?

01:21:49.937 --> 01:21:52.137
Will you excuse us, love?

01:21:53.937 --> 01:21:55.220
Georgia!

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:57.940
Georgia!

01:22:11.457 --> 01:22:14.131
I know what you did.
Luke told me everything.

01:22:14.132 --> 01:22:15.662
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.663 --> 01:22:16.921
- You need to admit it.
- Call for back up.

01:22:16.946 --> 01:22:19.031
- Let's talk about this later.
- Oh yeah, that would suit you, right.

01:22:19.056 --> 01:22:20.084
Away from your mam?

01:22:20.085 --> 01:22:21.456
Why won't you let me speak?

01:22:21.457 --> 01:22:24.241
- Because it's private. Please?
- Jas, love?

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:27.357
Please? You don't deserve pity.

01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:29.959
How could you do it? How?

01:22:29.984 --> 01:22:33.243
Georgia, you need to calm down.
She had nothing to do with Luke.

01:22:33.244 --> 01:22:36.043
Well she's not talking
about Luke, pet.

01:22:36.144 --> 01:22:37.244
Please don't say anything.

01:22:37.245 --> 01:22:39.420
You are nothing but a coward!

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.521
You ruined my life,
my dad's life!

01:22:42.522 --> 01:22:45.143
- Georgia, let's take this outside.
- No!

01:22:45.144 --> 01:22:47.143
No. You're not letting her
get away with it. Not any more.

01:22:47.144 --> 01:22:49.143
Tell the truth. Admit it!

01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:51.143
Look, I know the truth,
Georgia.

01:22:51.144 --> 01:22:54.412
I know. So come with me,
and we can talk this through.

01:22:54.413 --> 01:22:55.678
Come on, pet.

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:58.685
- Jas, what's this all about?
- Look at you.

01:22:58.686 --> 01:23:01.709
This is your last chance
to do it yourself.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.701
Look, she doesn't have to.

01:23:03.702 --> 01:23:06.924
We'll re-open the inquest
into your sister's death.

01:23:07.742 --> 01:23:09.362
You will?

01:23:13.344 --> 01:23:14.824
Come on.

01:23:15.944 --> 01:23:18.443
- What's this got to do with Thea?
- Nothing, Mum, nothing.

01:23:18.444 --> 01:23:20.544
- Jasmine?
- I'll tell you.

01:23:25.144 --> 01:23:27.344
She was with Thea that night.

01:23:28.057 --> 01:23:30.057
Her and Luke.

01:23:30.144 --> 01:23:33.243
She dared Thea to stand
on the edge of the crag.

01:23:33.244 --> 01:23:35.080
And when Thea fell

01:23:35.752 --> 01:23:38.540
she let us think it was all our fault!

01:23:39.387 --> 01:23:41.480
They both did.

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.143
It's not true, Mam.

01:23:47.144 --> 01:23:50.024
I'd never. I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't!

01:23:57.542 --> 01:23:59.542
Come on, pet.

01:24:19.392 --> 01:24:21.432
You look hollowed out.

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:24.417
I haven't slept in days.

01:24:26.339 --> 01:24:29.739
Look, I know the truth
was important to Luke.

01:24:31.917 --> 01:24:34.017
Did he come to see your dad?

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.143
I was so happy to see him.

01:24:37.144 --> 01:24:39.143
But he was upset,
he wouldn't look at us.

01:24:39.144 --> 01:24:41.243
Kept saying he wanted
to speak to me dad,

01:24:41.244 --> 01:24:43.444
but I told Luke I wouldn't wake him.

01:24:44.144 --> 01:24:47.840
Luke looks in a bad way.
Whatever it was, was hurting him.

01:24:49.144 --> 01:24:51.704
I begged him to tell us
what it was and

01:24:53.144 --> 01:24:54.984
eventually, he did.

01:24:59.026 --> 01:25:03.026
Luke could see Thea was wasted
when Jasmine dared her.

01:25:03.051 --> 01:25:05.051
He tried to stop her.

01:25:05.076 --> 01:25:09.076
But Jasmine just kept pushing her
on and on, and so...

01:25:12.144 --> 01:25:15.143
Afterwards,
Luke wanted to go to the police,

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:17.820
but Jasmine said
that they'd end up in prison,

01:25:17.945 --> 01:25:20.745
that she'd kill herself,
that it'd destroy his mam.

01:25:21.839 --> 01:25:23.519
She's just a kid, love.

01:25:23.544 --> 01:25:26.093
Just a stupid scared kid.

01:25:26.144 --> 01:25:30.344
Yeah, well, that KID made up
that Thea had depression.

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.143
Said people'd believe it was suicide
and Luke just went along with it.

01:25:34.144 --> 01:25:36.865
I wanted to hurt him,
like he'd hurt us.

01:25:36.866 --> 01:25:40.763
I kicked him, hit him, punched him.
He just let me.

01:25:40.764 --> 01:25:43.444
Until he fell,
and he banged his head, hard.

01:25:44.144 --> 01:25:46.143
Straight away,
I came to my senses.

01:25:46.144 --> 01:25:48.143
I was sorry.
I wanted to help him,

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:50.143
but it...
it wasn't bleeding, he was OK.

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.344
He just wanted to go home.

01:25:51.345 --> 01:25:54.243
And you drove him back,
did you?

01:25:54.344 --> 01:25:56.143
Yeah.

01:25:56.144 --> 01:25:58.344
And how did he seem?

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.300
Bit drunk. Slurring.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.695
Was that because of his head?

01:26:17.144 --> 01:26:18.644
Ma'am.

01:26:22.144 --> 01:26:24.144
I'm sorry.

01:26:26.144 --> 01:26:27.843
Come on.

01:26:28.144 --> 01:26:30.143
What'll happen to Jasmine?

01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:32.143
She's got to admit the truth.

01:26:32.144 --> 01:26:33.503
Oh, she will.

01:26:33.504 --> 01:26:35.543
She's got no choice, love.

01:26:35.644 --> 01:26:37.084
Come on.

01:27:58.964 --> 01:28:01.324
Um... I...

01:28:07.378 --> 01:28:08.898
Come on.
