WEBVTT

00:21.282 --> 00:23.240
Good morning, everyone.

00:23.284 --> 00:28.550
So I just saw from
my feed yesterday,

00:28.593 --> 00:32.249
I was at the apartment,

00:32.293 --> 00:37.254
of Ed Buck, in West Hollywood.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.301
There is something a lot bigger

00:40.344 --> 00:42.781
than what we're focusing
on that's going on.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.828
Not to take away from the
death of the two individuals,

00:45.871 --> 00:48.613
but there's...

00:48.657 --> 00:50.746
There's something
that's going on.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.836
And there's a whole
language about crystal meth

00:53.879 --> 00:56.143
and what they're doing
when it comes to sex,

00:56.186 --> 00:58.232
and it can go --
it goes into HIV,

00:58.275 --> 01:02.062
it goes into self-love,
it goes to the love

01:02.105 --> 01:04.107
that we're not
getting as children

01:04.151 --> 01:08.764
and us trying to figure
out what is going on as adults.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.985
It's so layered, it's -- I'm,
like, getting emotional now.

01:14.030 --> 01:17.251
But we have to, like,
really open up our eyes,

01:17.294 --> 01:19.035
and figure out what is going on

01:19.079 --> 01:22.647
to our brothers and sisters
out there, 'cause it's bad.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.520
And me personally,
Jayce Baron Sadler,

01:25.563 --> 01:29.132
will do all that I can to
make sure that this is like,

01:29.176 --> 01:30.960
not something that
goes on forever.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.528
All right, be blessed, bye.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.856
All right.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.653
How much longer are you
guys gonna turn your head,

02:11.696 --> 02:13.959
and act like you
don't see anything?

02:16.310 --> 02:20.052
Till another dead Black
man is in here.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.448
This is ridic--
This has to stop.

02:24.492 --> 02:28.452
No more to Gemmel Moores.
No more Timothy Deans.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.543
I don't care what they did,
what their past was,

02:32.587 --> 02:34.241
what they agreed to.

02:34.284 --> 02:37.418
They didn't agree to get killed.
They didn't agree to that!

02:37.461 --> 02:41.596
He's a predator!
He is preying on Black men.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.207
These too young men
belonged to somebody.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.949
They're somebody's children,
they're somebody's brother,

02:46.992 --> 02:48.603
they're somebody's uncle.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.432
And the comments of, "Oh,
they should've just said no."

02:51.475 --> 02:54.348
Any one of us could have had
this card in life.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.089
Arrest Ed Buck!
Arrest Ed Buck!

02:57.133 --> 03:00.528
Arrest Ed Buck!
Arrest Ed Buck!

03:00.571 --> 03:03.879
Arrest Ed Buck!
Arrest Ed Buck!

03:03.922 --> 03:05.968
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

03:06.011 --> 03:09.493
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

03:09.537 --> 03:11.974
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

03:12.017 --> 03:14.803
Mysterious deaths sparking
protests in Los Angeles.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.979
Two gay Black men
died at his home.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.633
Two men have died
in that apartment

03:18.676 --> 03:20.330
in such a short amount of time.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.114
on methamphetamine.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.594
Found dead in the apartment

03:23.638 --> 03:26.118
of the political activist
and Democratic donor.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.730
tens of thousands of dollars

03:28.773 --> 03:30.862
to high-profile
Democratic candidates.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.734
Former governor Jerry Brown

03:32.777 --> 03:34.301
and Hillary Clinton.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.824
Whose name now is more
synonymous with the deaths

03:35.867 --> 03:38.566
of two men in his
West Hollywood apartment.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.307
A violent, dangerous
sexual predator.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.396
The Democratic Party donor
Ed Buck.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.701
Democratic donor Ed Buck.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.268
-Ed Buck.
-Ed Buck.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.227
-Ed Buck.
-Edward Buck.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.286
Who is Ed Buck?

04:09.597 --> 04:12.469
I will not claim to
know Ed Buck personally,

04:12.513 --> 04:14.645
because I don't
know him personally.

04:16.865 --> 04:20.738
But what he represents
and who he is,

04:20.782 --> 04:25.308
I don't want to
give him any power.

04:26.570 --> 04:30.270
What we need is...

04:32.707 --> 04:39.453
...for us to be able to identify
how we end up on doorsteps

04:39.496 --> 04:42.543
like men like Ed Buck.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.945
the excitations

05:43.473 --> 05:46.041
When I first met Ed,
he was very talkative.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.565
He had intelligence.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.350
I knew, or learned
shortly thereafter,

05:50.393 --> 05:53.831
he had run for governor
in the state of Arizona.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.660
I knew that he was a Republican,
and I'm not.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.401
I'm a Democrat.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
But the fact that
he'd run for office

06:00.403 --> 06:03.406
and almost took
Governor Mecham of Arizona out

06:03.450 --> 06:04.538
made him interesting to me.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.808
But he was out as a gay man,

06:13.851 --> 06:15.940
and if you move
into West Hollywood,

06:15.984 --> 06:19.596
you're either gay or presumed
to be possibly gay.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.772
And so I think by
the time Ed got here,

06:21.816 --> 06:26.473
he intended this destination
to explore his sexuality.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.620
He was very involved with
the Democratic Party,

06:43.664 --> 06:48.146
the Democratic clubs,
the Stonewall Democratic Club.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.192
But his role
in West Hollywood government

06:50.235 --> 06:53.064
has been primarily
as a agitator.

06:56.546 --> 06:59.506
You know, he'd come to
council meetings on occasion

06:59.549 --> 07:01.943
and scream and yell
about development issues.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.466
That's what I recall.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.686
Now I'm wondering whether
some of those appearances

07:05.729 --> 07:10.038
before council were under
the influence of meth,

07:10.081 --> 07:13.171
because that sort of
anger and agitation

07:13.215 --> 07:17.480
and the sweaty brow,
the clenched fist,

07:17.524 --> 07:19.743
the teeth being gritted.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.311
I mean, now I recognize all
of that to be the symptoms

07:22.354 --> 07:25.009
of somebody under the
influence of amphetamine.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.148
Folks, a disturbing
story out of California,

07:33.191 --> 07:37.065
where pressure is now growing
on some Democratic politicians

07:37.108 --> 07:39.937
to return money from a
wealthy white party donor,

07:39.981 --> 07:43.114
following the death of a young
Black gay man at his home.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.856
26 year old Gemmel Moore
died on July 27th,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.597
at the West Hollywood apartment

07:47.641 --> 07:49.556
of prominent California donor
Ed Buck.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.122
Authorities rule that Moore died

07:51.166 --> 07:54.256
of an accidental
crystal meth overdose.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.040
But police are now
taking a closer look

07:56.084 --> 07:59.522
at what happened at Buck's
residence the night Moore died.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.525
And Moore's mother is openly
questioning whether Buck

08:02.569 --> 08:05.136
may have had something to
do with her son's death.

08:07.269 --> 08:10.315
Gemmel was scared.
He was scared of this man.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.840
He came and he laid
in my arms and he cried,

08:12.883 --> 08:14.494
and he was scared.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.671
He was scared that this man was
going to hurt him.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.977
And he went
to the police station,

08:20.021 --> 08:22.327
and they told him to go away.

08:22.371 --> 08:25.243
You know? They told --
They did not believe him.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.289
He called me in tears,

08:27.332 --> 08:29.596
crying that he didn't
want to be this person.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.902
He wrote a diary
saying that he did not,

08:31.946 --> 08:33.861
and he was scared
he was going to die.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.434
This man, he went
out there searching

08:42.478 --> 08:45.568
for other men that
were struggling

08:45.612 --> 08:49.050
and on the streets
and had no money, you know?

08:49.093 --> 08:52.227
And I mean, men who had never
experienced drugs before.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.233
There's a lot of things that
I would go out there and do

08:58.276 --> 09:02.759
for $600 and then another $600.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.587
Oh, you know, "I'll do it again.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.284
I'll give you $1,200
if you do it again."

09:06.328 --> 09:09.070
This is what Ed Buck
said to him,

09:09.113 --> 09:11.681
It's easy money.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.117
But it's not.

09:13.988 --> 09:17.252
It's not, and we are
allowing people in power

09:17.295 --> 09:20.647
to pay for our lives

09:20.690 --> 09:23.563
and to take them away
with their money.

09:31.005 --> 09:34.791
Ed Buck is a predator,

09:34.835 --> 09:37.925
that masqueraded around

09:37.968 --> 09:41.319
just to hunt down the bodies
of Black men.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.974
Someone that was
hiding in plain sight,

09:44.018 --> 09:46.934
masquerading under
the Democratic Party,

09:46.977 --> 09:49.806
masquerading around,
wanting to help people.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.940
Ed Buck was someone,

09:52.983 --> 09:54.811
and still in many ways
is likely someone,

09:54.855 --> 09:58.641
who still has money, access,
resources, and power.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.643
And even if he doesn't
necessarily have it,

10:00.687 --> 10:04.168
there's a transference of
his power to someone else.

10:04.212 --> 10:07.041
And so there wasn't
a doubt in my mind

10:07.084 --> 10:08.912
that America wasn't going
to hold him accountable

10:08.956 --> 10:10.784
because we have watched
America time and time again

10:10.827 --> 10:12.655
never hold their
own accountable

10:12.699 --> 10:17.312
for the things that they have
done to other groups of people

10:17.355 --> 10:19.531
who come from
communities that deal with

10:19.575 --> 10:21.533
the additional
marginalizations of race

10:21.577 --> 10:24.449
and queerness and any
other intersections,

10:24.493 --> 10:26.190
such as being poor.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.369
The indictment alleges
Buck solicited men

10:31.413 --> 10:32.675
through a recruiter

10:32.719 --> 10:35.025
or gay dating sites
like Adam4Adam

10:35.069 --> 10:37.985
to his apartment to
"party and play" --

10:38.028 --> 10:42.380
aka get high and have sex
and sometimes get paid.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.861
Seeking out men
in that category

10:44.905 --> 10:49.126
and providing them
food, shelter, and drugs

10:49.170 --> 10:53.174
are the signs of somebody
with a scheme in mind.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.959
It was only when
Timothy Dean happened,

10:56.003 --> 10:59.659
when there was a second death
in Ed Buck's apartment,

10:59.702 --> 11:02.400
where all of a sudden
everybody went, "Whoa, wait!"

11:10.844 --> 11:12.715
The news came on,

11:12.759 --> 11:16.153
and I seen it on the Internet.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.722
And so I text Tim,
and I was like, "Tim..."

11:19.766 --> 11:23.421
And his message went green.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.080
Investigators in California

11:30.124 --> 11:33.127
looking into the second death
of an African-American man

11:33.170 --> 11:36.217
in the home of Democratic
megadonor Ed Buck.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.873
The man now being identified
as 55-year-old Timothy Dean.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.440
He died of an apparent overdose.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.059
I miss that laugh.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.843
When he would come
up to you, you know,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.933
he'd tickle your sides or, you
know, give you this big hug,

11:56.977 --> 11:58.282
he'd smile at you.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.284
We used to call him
Too Much Drama.

12:00.328 --> 12:04.419
And he was, you know -- Tim Dean
was just larger than life.

12:04.462 --> 12:09.641
He had this personality that
you knew when he entered a room.

12:09.685 --> 12:14.864
You knew how he loved you
by the way that he treated you.

12:19.826 --> 12:23.612
I never knew that Tim was using

12:23.655 --> 12:27.616
until I started having
my battles with it.

12:27.659 --> 12:31.838
And you know, I talked to
Tim about that situation.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.318
And Tim in turn started
to talk to me about

12:34.362 --> 12:36.277
things to look for, you know,

12:36.320 --> 12:39.802
his situations and things
that have gone on with him.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.719
That was Tim's way.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.505
He was always serving,
always honest, always open.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.604
About a month or so before,
we were at Gym Bar

12:59.648 --> 13:01.432
out here on Santa Monica.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.697
And, you know,
we had a conversation.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.004
We were just like,
"Can you believe

13:08.048 --> 13:10.354
that this
happened to Gemmel Moore,

13:10.398 --> 13:13.793
and you know, there were
no repercussions from it?"

13:15.969 --> 13:17.231
And...

13:19.929 --> 13:22.236
He looked at me, and he said,

13:22.279 --> 13:26.109
"Promise me, don't you ever
take your ass over there."

13:27.632 --> 13:29.025
He's like, "I'm not
trying to go over there

13:29.069 --> 13:30.505
and end up dead."

13:36.032 --> 13:38.034
All these people
calling for his arrest,

13:38.078 --> 13:40.950
a second man dies in the
course of all of this.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.343
Was there ever a point --

13:42.386 --> 13:44.258
I mean,
if I found that you have this

13:44.301 --> 13:46.913
what could be used as
evidence, but now you can't,

13:46.956 --> 13:48.653
how does that make you feel?

13:48.697 --> 13:51.613
It's extremely frustrating,
because we as prosecutors,

13:51.656 --> 13:53.397
if we think someone is guilty,

13:53.441 --> 13:55.399
we want to do our
best to make sure

13:55.443 --> 13:57.227
that they're brought to justice.

13:57.271 --> 14:01.014
But our justice system is
based on testable evidence.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.319
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

14:02.363 --> 14:05.061
You can't bring
in a mob, a crowd,

14:05.105 --> 14:07.498
and say to the jury, "Well,
the mob says they're guilty,

14:07.542 --> 14:09.326
so you better convict."

14:18.161 --> 14:19.902
But the sad reality is that

14:19.946 --> 14:21.991
overdosing in West Hollywood,
tragically,

14:22.035 --> 14:24.428
I hate to tell people,
happens every month.

14:25.603 --> 14:28.432
I mean, every month
somebody O.D.s in an apartment

14:28.476 --> 14:29.520
in West Hollywood.

14:30.957 --> 14:34.786
So the fact that
somebody overdosed,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.701
I hate to say it,
is pretty common.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.926
There's just this
underlying messaging,

14:43.970 --> 14:45.145
like, "Overdosing happens.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.408
People use a lot
of drugs out here,

14:47.451 --> 14:50.890
people overdose,
it's just a thing that happens."

14:50.933 --> 14:52.630
I think, though,
that's very dismissive

14:52.674 --> 14:56.069
of what this
particular case was,

14:56.112 --> 14:58.941
especially because of
the power dynamics at play.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.161
You're talking about,
again, a rich white man,

15:01.204 --> 15:03.337
and a young, poor
Black queer man.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.819
I think that just speaks
volumes about where we are.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.734
And as long as we are Black,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.780
we are always going to
be harmed by a system.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.609
It is that additional
layer, though,

15:14.652 --> 15:18.569
of queerness that then puts
us in even more harm's way.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.579
It is not the person
who does not have.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.017
It is the person
who has everything

15:31.060 --> 15:37.110
and offers you everything with
this particular type of risk,

15:37.153 --> 15:39.590
i.e., the meth.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.724
And the sex.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.421
Those types of offers,

15:44.465 --> 15:46.989
a young, poor Black queer
person has to balance out,

15:47.033 --> 15:50.601
"Do I eat today?
Do I have shelter today?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.953
And do I engage in this
activity that may be dangerous,

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
but at least I ate, at least
I had money in my pocket.

15:56.042 --> 15:59.871
At least I'm going to
be okay for a few days?"

15:59.915 --> 16:01.743
And that is why we
have to make sure

16:01.786 --> 16:05.094
that we are supportive
of the victim here.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.835
And even
at the community level,

16:06.878 --> 16:09.098
when we have community
interventions,

16:09.142 --> 16:11.013
it's about kind of
individuals coming together,

16:11.057 --> 16:14.974
to kind of try and change
bigger structures and systems.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.977
But that doesn't feel equitable,

16:18.020 --> 16:20.066
that doesn't speak
to the reasons

16:20.109 --> 16:24.026
why we see
disproportionate impacts,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.290
and it doesn't change
how all of these things

16:27.334 --> 16:28.552
are interconnected.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.511
So, we have to go
to the root of it.

16:50.487 --> 16:53.403
West Hollywood has
been a city since 1984.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.449
However, the place
known as West Hollywood,

16:55.492 --> 16:57.190
has been here for
a hundred years.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.670
And it's always been
a place for outliers,

16:59.714 --> 17:01.324
non-conforming people.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.250
All the speakeasies
and bathtub gin,

17:14.294 --> 17:16.644
and all the underground
nightclubs got formed up here

17:16.687 --> 17:18.341
on the Sunset Strip.

17:20.474 --> 17:23.085
And then during the 1940s,
the Rat Pack took over,

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
Frank Sinatra
and Sammy Davis Jr.,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.523
and Don Rickles.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.920
In the 1950s,
communists and socialists

17:31.963 --> 17:35.097
and other social undesirables
began to flock here

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
to be away from the patrol

17:37.143 --> 17:38.796
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.494
In the '60s,
it was the hippies

17:40.537 --> 17:43.105
and the Mamas and the Papas
and the flower children,

17:43.149 --> 17:45.281
and the anti-Vietnam War
protestors.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.634
And in the '70s, the gays
finally arrived in the '70s.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.116
This is the
face of Santa Monica Boulevard,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
that is familiar
to most outsiders.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.642
But the street also
has a private side,

17:58.686 --> 18:01.863
perceived by outsiders
only if it dawns on them

18:01.906 --> 18:05.084
that almost all of the
people they see here are men.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.310
For this area of West Hollywood
has become a gay ghetto,

18:14.354 --> 18:17.487
a sociological phenomenon
of these times.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.621
And the main street of the
homosexual community here

18:20.664 --> 18:22.057
is Santa Monica Boulevard.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.628
And it's always been a place
where you could be anything,

18:27.671 --> 18:29.108
do anything, Bohemia.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.467
But the reality is that
the city of West Hollywood

18:40.510 --> 18:44.166
is not as diverse as other
parts of Los Angeles County.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.519
Looking at West Hollywood's
racial makeup today,

18:49.563 --> 18:53.958
it's about 4% Black,
about 4% Asian,

18:54.002 --> 18:56.265
about 12% Latino,

18:56.309 --> 18:58.963
and everything else, 80%,
is white.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.926
It's funny that you
asked me this

19:04.969 --> 19:08.973
because the most overt racism
that I have ever experienced

19:09.017 --> 19:10.932
has been at the hands
of West Hollywood.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.368
The most.

19:12.412 --> 19:16.938
I'm talking about
in-your-face, N-word-type racism

19:16.981 --> 19:18.896
has been in West Hollywood.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.637
People who have run their
fingers through my hair

19:20.681 --> 19:22.335
without my consent.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.119
There's been finger waving,

19:24.163 --> 19:27.601
"I got an inner Black woman
in me," without my consent.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.037
And at nighttime,

19:29.080 --> 19:30.517
I'm not going to
even discredit it

19:30.560 --> 19:32.519
because West Hollywood
gets really fun at night,

19:32.562 --> 19:34.085
but I also know what
comes with that.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.958
Like, I've seen white
drag queens in blackface.

19:37.001 --> 19:41.049
So West Hollywood,
it doesn't feel safe to me.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.399
It feels safe in the daytime,
so to speak.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.321
Santa Monica Boulevard
grew into its own identity,

19:52.365 --> 19:54.671
mostly around LGBT culture.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.543
You know, the
"Historic Boys Town" District.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.153
And the reason it's
called Boys Town --

19:58.197 --> 20:00.068
I know that's offensive
to some people today --

20:00.111 --> 20:05.204
is that West Hollywood is
40% LGBT, but of that 40%,

20:05.247 --> 20:08.511
90% identify as gay
or bisexual men.

20:08.555 --> 20:12.428
So it is a city of, you know,
LGBT,

20:12.472 --> 20:15.692
but predominantly
white gay and bisexual men.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.314
I have a lot of friends
that are gay Black men.

20:28.357 --> 20:34.842
So I've also witnessed extreme
fetishism, like, extreme.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.148
Might as well place them
on a proverbial auction box,

20:37.192 --> 20:38.672
if you know what I mean.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.196
You go into a bar and a
lot of people ignore you,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.242
you know,
until they start drinking.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.157
And then after they done had
about three or four drinks,

20:46.201 --> 20:47.811
they approach you and go,

20:47.855 --> 20:51.554
"Oh, you're pretty
cute for a Black guy."

20:51.598 --> 20:56.037
Bitch! Is that supposed to
make me feel attractive?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.257
I knew I was a fine piece
of chocolate ass

20:58.300 --> 21:00.084
before I left out the house!

21:01.434 --> 21:04.001
Tell me something original,
you know?

21:04.045 --> 21:07.831
And it's, "Oh, I want
some of that Black cock."

21:07.875 --> 21:10.051
Ugh! Cock?

21:10.094 --> 21:12.358
Ain't no chickens running
around nowhere on me.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.057
And it's just like this
is supposed to turn me on

21:16.100 --> 21:20.757
and make me feel special,
you know, being fetishized.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.637
White men just grab.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.769
Just grab.

21:41.561 --> 21:45.521
I have been, like, walked up on
and kissed

21:45.565 --> 21:48.655
in the mouth before
by a white gay man.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.352
I mean, it's happened
once in front of friends

21:50.396 --> 21:51.788
who actually had to --

21:51.832 --> 21:55.270
like, two friends who
were cishet Black women,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.620
who literally had to,
like, tell the guy, like,

21:57.664 --> 21:58.926
"You don't do that."

21:58.969 --> 22:01.189
And literally his response was,

22:01.232 --> 22:02.712
"Oh, y'all aren't
in our community.

22:02.756 --> 22:05.324
This is what we do."

22:06.542 --> 22:09.502
And I just remember
in that moment,

22:09.545 --> 22:12.548
like, "That is really sad,

22:12.592 --> 22:14.637
because that is what
most people think."

22:20.382 --> 22:22.384
"This is what we do
in our community,

22:22.428 --> 22:25.431
and, like, we have the
license to touch other people

22:25.474 --> 22:28.869
in a way and to grab people
in their private areas."

22:28.912 --> 22:30.523
I think it happens
a lot of times

22:30.566 --> 22:34.004
in primarily
white-queer-dominated spaces,

22:34.048 --> 22:37.791
where they really, really think
they have ownership over us.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.185
And that's like
Fetishization 101 almost.

22:56.026 --> 23:00.814
But it is a historical element
to where this is coming from.

23:00.857 --> 23:04.600
Mandingo!
Purebred Mandingo.

23:04.644 --> 23:05.645
4,000!

23:05.688 --> 23:07.429
I'll pay more!
500 more!

23:07.473 --> 23:10.432
It might be linked
to the fetishism

23:10.476 --> 23:13.217
around Black and brown bodies.

23:13.261 --> 23:16.438
And this is historical.
It goes back to slavery.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.619
It's about the control and
manipulation of Black people.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.795
People could be sold
from their families.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.798
Men, women, and children
could be sexualized,

23:28.842 --> 23:30.278
sexually abused.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.541
You attacked me.

23:32.585 --> 23:36.197
So now, lessen you do
what I want...

23:38.591 --> 23:40.984
...I'm gonna tell him
everything.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.335
It links to issues
around segregation

23:44.379 --> 23:47.643
and the control of Black people
moving in spaces

23:47.687 --> 23:50.429
and white-only spaces
and Black-only spaces.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.344
I have watched
people in this country,

23:53.388 --> 23:55.651
generation after generation,
have this ownership

23:55.695 --> 23:58.828
and have this power over
this particular race.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.527
A white woman lies about a young
Black boy whistling at her,

24:01.570 --> 24:03.137
and he gets murdered.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.182
Like, we have seen time
and time and time again,

24:05.226 --> 24:07.489
what the reverse of that
fetishization looks like,

24:07.533 --> 24:09.448
what a rejection of the
fetishization looks like,

24:09.491 --> 24:12.320
what a lie around
fetishization looks like.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.543
And it looks like our death.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.940
And so Black trauma in America

24:23.984 --> 24:25.855
I think is very much linked to

24:25.899 --> 24:28.031
Black people's history
in this country.

24:28.075 --> 24:31.165
And people don't really have
conversations around that.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.688
Most people think that,

24:32.732 --> 24:35.474
"Well, slavery was like
several hundred years ago

24:35.517 --> 24:37.867
and people aren't still
affected by that."

24:37.911 --> 24:39.521
But there are
generational things

24:39.565 --> 24:41.958
I think have been
passed on to people,

24:42.002 --> 24:45.092
that have never been
addressed around that trauma.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.791
Whatever you kind of look at,

24:48.835 --> 24:51.751
you see how these kinds
of systems of racism,

24:51.794 --> 24:54.405
show up today in
our everyday life.

24:54.449 --> 24:59.802
And there's no stronger example
of racial inequity,

24:59.846 --> 25:02.544
racism, anti-Blackness
than health outcomes.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.290
And if we're talking
about West Hollywood,

25:09.333 --> 25:13.990
then HIV in particular really
shows the intersectionality

25:14.034 --> 25:15.252
of oppression.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.749
In Los Angeles,

25:33.793 --> 25:37.231
we have higher cases in
some pretty specific areas.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.974
You see it more
in West Hollywood.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.501
A lot of that is 'cause we see
a lot of same-gender loving

25:46.545 --> 25:49.460
and queer people living
in West Hollywood,

25:49.504 --> 25:55.554
and we have higher numbers
of HIV and STDs

25:55.597 --> 25:57.164
in that community,

25:57.207 --> 26:00.080
not because people
are having more sex,

26:00.123 --> 26:02.256
but because this is what
oppression looks like, right?

26:02.299 --> 26:03.953
You kind of group people up,

26:03.997 --> 26:07.478
and push them in the margins
further, further, further,

26:07.522 --> 26:09.568
you have a smaller
group of people

26:09.611 --> 26:11.395
where infection kind of happens.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.052
10,000 people in West Hollywood

26:16.096 --> 26:17.663
and the surrounding
neighborhoods

26:17.706 --> 26:19.621
were lost in a 15-year period.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.800
That's unbelievable,

26:24.844 --> 26:27.411
if you think about
losing 10,000 people

26:27.455 --> 26:30.327
in a place
that's 1.9 square miles.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.982
I mean, it's like
a bomb got dropped

26:33.026 --> 26:35.115
in the middle of a community.

26:42.557 --> 26:45.516
And so West Hollywood
has been at the forefront

26:45.560 --> 26:48.084
in doing a lot of the pioneering
work around HIV and AIDS

26:48.128 --> 26:49.564
since it's inception.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.262
City was created in 1984, right?

26:52.306 --> 26:55.483
And so even though HIV
had been around since '81,

26:55.526 --> 26:58.225
all the development of
the response to HIV,

26:58.268 --> 27:01.620
a lot of it was based and
centered around West Hollywood.

27:07.756 --> 27:11.586
When you look at
the city of West Hollywood,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.675
or, you know,
more affluent areas,

27:13.719 --> 27:16.722
more areas that are,
let's just say, white,

27:16.765 --> 27:19.028
you see that the money
is going there,

27:19.072 --> 27:21.117
and you see that
the resources are there.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.602
But when you go to
South Los Angeles,

27:27.646 --> 27:30.692
and you can have those
same kinds of hot zones,

27:30.736 --> 27:32.215
for lack of a better word,

27:32.259 --> 27:33.956
there is not the dollar there,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.959
there is not the enthusiasm
to really combat it

27:37.003 --> 27:38.657
like you see in West Hollywood.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.269
And so even though
West Hollywood's a red spot

27:42.312 --> 27:45.359
and South L.A. is a red spot,

27:45.402 --> 27:47.666
the experience is
very different.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.676
When you have more HIV or
any type of infectious disease

27:57.719 --> 27:59.852
in a community,
it's more likely to spread.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.378
And then when you think about
kind of Black communities,

28:04.421 --> 28:06.946
you think about
communities of color,

28:06.989 --> 28:08.904
we are smaller in proportion,

28:08.948 --> 28:13.692
and we tend to associate
ourselves in smaller circles.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.129
So, most of my friends
are Black, right?

28:16.172 --> 28:17.783
That's a smaller
number of people.

28:17.826 --> 28:20.350
And so when you take an
infectious disease like HIV

28:20.394 --> 28:24.006
and put it in a smaller circle,
it's going to move faster.

28:24.050 --> 28:28.228
And this is the bigger
kind of 50,000-foot picture

28:28.271 --> 28:32.928
of what centuries and centuries
of oppression

28:32.972 --> 28:34.364
have looked like
for Black people.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.761
When you look at
the history of health care,

28:39.805 --> 28:43.765
especially Black folks
in the United States,

28:43.809 --> 28:47.464
there has been no reason
to ever trust

28:47.508 --> 28:48.988
the health-care system here.

28:50.163 --> 28:52.556
Experiments were done to slaves.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.952
Experiments to
test out surgeries,

28:56.996 --> 29:00.434
to test out the
removal of body parts

29:00.477 --> 29:01.783
and attaching them
in other places,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.263
and how the body would respond.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.874
Like, there've been a lot
of heinous things done

29:05.918 --> 29:08.790
to Black folks in
the health-care arena

29:08.834 --> 29:12.489
to "create breakthroughs."

29:12.533 --> 29:15.188
But we were the people
who were used

29:15.231 --> 29:17.233
for those breakthroughs.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.021
In 1932, America's
Public Health Service

29:22.064 --> 29:24.458
set out to study syphilis,

29:24.501 --> 29:27.026
but it pursued this
worthy goal in a manner

29:27.069 --> 29:29.463
that was irredeemably cruel --

29:29.506 --> 29:32.205
the infamous project called
"The Tuskegee Study

29:32.248 --> 29:35.295
of Untreated Syphilis
in the Negro Male."

29:35.338 --> 29:38.124
Several hundred
African-American men,

29:38.167 --> 29:40.517
men the Public Health Service
recruited

29:40.561 --> 29:44.478
at churches and clinics and
farms, were used in the study.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.175
Most of these men had syphilis.

29:46.219 --> 29:49.700
None of them knew their
bodies harbored this disease.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.267
And then
the Public Health Service

29:51.311 --> 29:53.530
followed the men's lives,

29:53.574 --> 29:55.576
watched how the
disease developed,

29:55.619 --> 29:59.014
all the while
withholding medicine,

29:59.058 --> 30:01.669
withholding treatment
of any kind

30:01.712 --> 30:04.106
for these innocent
American citizens.

30:04.150 --> 30:08.937
Medical professionals willingly,
intentionally,

30:08.981 --> 30:12.245
let human beings suffer
from a treatable,

30:12.288 --> 30:15.291
and then later
a curable illness.

30:16.727 --> 30:20.122
The major cases, of something
like the Tuskegee,

30:20.166 --> 30:22.864
that is the one case
where everybody is like,

30:22.908 --> 30:24.431
"This is why we don't
necessarily trust

30:24.474 --> 30:25.736
when the vaccine comes out.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.129
This is why we don't
necessarily trust

30:27.173 --> 30:30.567
when anything new comes out,

30:30.611 --> 30:32.221
any new medication,
any new drug,

30:32.265 --> 30:34.484
any new procedure,
any new treatment comes out."

30:34.528 --> 30:39.054
And it is truly because
we remember that,

30:39.098 --> 30:41.578
and we remember
what was done to us.

30:42.579 --> 30:45.060
We were treated unfairly,

30:45.104 --> 30:47.889
to some extent
like Guinea pigs.

30:49.456 --> 30:55.592
We were all hardworking men
and not boys

30:55.636 --> 30:58.508
and citizens of
the United States.

30:58.552 --> 31:05.254
The wounds that were inflicted
upon us cannot be undone.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.735
Even if you wanted to
invest in your health care,

31:07.778 --> 31:11.652
there's a fear there,
a very real fear,

31:11.695 --> 31:13.610
because it is based
on truthful events

31:13.654 --> 31:15.221
and things that have happened.

31:15.264 --> 31:18.877
Men who were poor
and African-American,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.923
without resources
and with few alternatives,

31:21.967 --> 31:23.490
they believed
they had found hope

31:23.533 --> 31:26.014
when they were offered
free medical care

31:26.058 --> 31:29.713
by the United States
Public Health Service.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.238
They were betrayed.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.332
It's just embedded
into our culture

31:39.375 --> 31:42.813
to not seek medical attention
until the necessary moment

31:42.857 --> 31:44.685
to have to seek
medical attention.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.688
And so you have
that playing a role,

31:47.731 --> 31:50.256
but then you also have the fact
that if you just look

31:50.299 --> 31:53.999
at our socioeconomic status
in this country,

31:54.042 --> 31:57.219
we don't have the resources
to have annual checkups

31:57.263 --> 31:58.568
and annual physicals.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.222
Some of us don't have
health insurance.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.964
Some of us don't have
primary care doctors.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.532
So it's not even just
as simple as saying,

32:05.575 --> 32:08.622
"Oh, we don't trust
the health-care system."

32:09.884 --> 32:12.756
Many of us don't even
have the finances

32:12.800 --> 32:14.758
to even invest in
our own health.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.546
So, we're asking people to try

32:19.589 --> 32:22.418
and go through this
piecemeal system,

32:22.462 --> 32:24.943
on top of potentially
having genetics

32:24.986 --> 32:27.771
that kind of make you
predisposed to addiction,

32:27.815 --> 32:30.339
without social services
and other support systems

32:30.383 --> 32:33.864
that really respond to
these outcomes that,

32:33.908 --> 32:36.519
you know, are traumatizing.

32:38.217 --> 32:42.264
And this is why we see
people who abuse substances,

32:42.308 --> 32:45.180
or people who use
substances as well.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.660
You know, because,
"The shit is hard,

32:46.703 --> 32:48.227
so why wouldn't I
try and get something

32:48.270 --> 32:49.445
to make me feel better?"

32:58.715 --> 33:00.587
Methamphetamine, methedrine,

33:00.630 --> 33:03.720
which is known among
drug users as speed.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.594
The person who is using
this drug as a drug user

33:07.637 --> 33:12.164
will smack or mainline --
that is, take intravenously --

33:12.207 --> 33:14.427
a thousand milligrams,

33:14.470 --> 33:19.388
100 times the dose that
any person would give

33:19.432 --> 33:22.522
in the medical use
of this kind of drug.

33:22.565 --> 33:27.135
Causes a fantastic
speeding up of the mind.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.442
At the same time,

33:29.485 --> 33:31.226
his heart is beating
at a fantastic rate,

33:31.270 --> 33:34.055
maybe in excess of
150 beats a minute,

33:34.099 --> 33:35.970
normal being 72.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.493
As this drug begins to wear off,

33:37.537 --> 33:39.756
there's a tremendous
psychic reaction,

33:39.800 --> 33:42.455
so the person becomes
markedly depressed,

33:42.498 --> 33:43.891
severely depressed,

33:43.934 --> 33:46.285
which in itself is
enough reason for him

33:46.328 --> 33:48.374
to want to take more drugs.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.552
Back then it was
called crank.

33:52.595 --> 33:56.643
It's associated in the gay
community as a sex drug.

33:56.686 --> 34:00.908
So if somebody is wanting to
party and play for days on end,

34:00.951 --> 34:03.345
notwithstanding the
fact nobody can maintain

34:03.389 --> 34:05.130
any sort of erection for days,

34:05.173 --> 34:08.176
but still the party and play
atmosphere of using that drug

34:08.220 --> 34:12.137
in those sexual scenarios
just feeds the beast.

34:15.923 --> 34:18.621
McInjecting drugs for
the purpose of having sex.

34:25.541 --> 34:29.458
You party, and you all
do different types of drugs

34:29.502 --> 34:30.677
like crystal meth.

34:31.852 --> 34:34.855
When you see the large "T"
for Tina.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.292
Sometimes you'll see, like
I said, like blue elephants,

34:37.336 --> 34:40.426
and you'll see things
that indicate Ecstasy,

34:40.469 --> 34:43.994
or things that indicate
Molly usage or pill usage.

34:44.038 --> 34:48.651
Getting high on any various
amounts of these drugs

34:48.695 --> 34:52.264
and having sex for hours.

35:13.981 --> 35:17.245
There's a high, there's
a moment that one chases.

35:19.204 --> 35:23.033
There's a moment when
I'm either high or drunk

35:23.077 --> 35:25.210
where the world seems
to suddenly make sense

35:25.253 --> 35:27.429
and everything falls into place.

35:27.473 --> 35:28.648
It's that one moment.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.953
It can be on a dance floor,

35:29.997 --> 35:31.651
it can be in the
middle of an orgy,

35:31.694 --> 35:33.957
it can be in the middle
of a sexual scenario.

35:35.698 --> 35:38.310
For me, when I used to get
drunk or high, was at Gay Pride.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.400
When I was out on the dance
floor with 2,000 people,

35:41.443 --> 35:44.359
LGBT of every stripe
in the community,

35:44.403 --> 35:45.795
and the bass was pounding

35:45.839 --> 35:48.668
and everybody was moving
like a tribe, right?

35:48.711 --> 35:51.366
Like a tribe of people,
and there was no difference.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.325
That's the moment for me,

35:53.368 --> 35:56.632
that connection
to a tribe of community.

35:59.548 --> 36:02.551
And, you know, you think
you're having fun with it,

36:02.595 --> 36:04.858
but you also didn't
want people to know

36:04.901 --> 36:08.383
that you're doing this
and that you're partying,

36:08.427 --> 36:11.560
you're having sex,
and you're into this world,

36:11.604 --> 36:14.215
because of everything
else going on around you.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.790
Crystal meth, to me,
was Middle America,

36:23.833 --> 36:25.270
"We ain't got nothing to do.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.880
And we're gonna hit this pipe,

36:26.923 --> 36:29.143
and carrying on with our lives."

36:29.187 --> 36:33.321
When I heard that it was
affecting my community,

36:33.365 --> 36:35.236
and even in the way it was,

36:35.280 --> 36:39.545
with sex work, even intimacy,

36:39.588 --> 36:44.071
it broke my heart
because I knew,

36:44.114 --> 36:47.248
coming from a place
who has had issues

36:47.292 --> 36:50.512
with dealing with family
and friends, with sexuality,

36:50.556 --> 36:53.123
that it was coming
from a place of hurt.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.430
And the fact that
sex was involved,

36:55.474 --> 36:57.780
some people are seeking
some type of intimacy

36:57.824 --> 37:00.261
they didn't get from
mommy and daddy.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.482
It's a myriad of factors just
relating back to surviving

37:03.525 --> 37:07.486
and relating to just trying to
get through their day-to-day

37:07.529 --> 37:10.924
and deal with the social factors
that come with being gay,

37:10.967 --> 37:12.447
with being Black in America.

37:17.017 --> 37:19.367
There are issues that
are not being processed

37:19.411 --> 37:21.326
around sexual orientation.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.415
And the Black
community historically

37:23.458 --> 37:25.678
has had problems with that.

37:25.721 --> 37:30.291
But before we get so
aggressive in our chastisements

37:30.335 --> 37:32.815
or, you know, put them in some
kind of program or whatever,

37:32.859 --> 37:36.819
we need to understand
the why, the root cause.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.835
Many people grow up
in the Black church.

37:52.879 --> 37:56.622
In the Black church, people
don't necessarily believe

37:56.665 --> 37:57.927
that that's condoned.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.538
They see that as two
different issues.

37:59.581 --> 38:02.280
They don't see
the LGBT community

38:02.323 --> 38:03.759
or people that are part of it

38:03.803 --> 38:06.196
as part of the Black community,
necessarily.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.155
That perverted
homosexual spirit

38:08.198 --> 38:10.766
is a spirit of delusion
and confusion

38:10.810 --> 38:13.291
and it has deceived
many men and women!

38:13.334 --> 38:15.945
And it's caused a stain
on the body of Christ.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.208
And those homosexual spirits
have been angry,

38:18.252 --> 38:19.558
and they come up
against you, saying,

38:19.601 --> 38:20.776
"You got to love everybody."

38:20.820 --> 38:22.430
Sit down, you serpent!

38:22.474 --> 38:24.867
Come on! Talk!

38:24.911 --> 38:27.696
And there's a lot of shame
and guilt around being gay,

38:27.740 --> 38:30.569
for many people who've
not processed that,

38:30.612 --> 38:32.179
because of family rejection,

38:32.222 --> 38:35.095
community rejection,
religious issues.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.882
And so they come into
these relationships,

38:39.926 --> 38:42.537
and in order to function,

38:42.581 --> 38:45.323
whether it's like a hookup
or a relationship,

38:45.366 --> 38:47.063
they have to be intoxicated

38:47.107 --> 38:48.587
in order to connect
to that person.

38:53.679 --> 38:54.897
When they use drugs,

38:54.941 --> 38:57.073
it helps them to
overcome that hump,

38:57.117 --> 38:59.206
overcome the shame
they may feel.

38:59.249 --> 39:01.513
So, I have seen
a huge correlation

39:01.556 --> 39:04.516
between drug use and sex work.

39:16.179 --> 39:19.313
I had an individual that
I mentored for years,

39:19.357 --> 39:22.229
and this person disappeared.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.405
And when the person resurfaced,
you know,

39:24.449 --> 39:25.928
they shared that they had been

39:25.972 --> 39:27.626
working the block
or working the street.

39:27.669 --> 39:30.106
And when I inquired,
"Well, what happened?"

39:30.150 --> 39:33.501
it was no judgment, they shared
that they engage in sex work

39:33.545 --> 39:35.373
because it makes
them feel loved.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.552
This person said that,
"When I'm on the street

39:40.595 --> 39:43.772
and when someone picks me up
and pays me and holds me

39:43.816 --> 39:45.644
and we have sex, I feel loved.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.646
I feel like I matter."

39:47.689 --> 39:51.519
And knowing that this
person grew up in a home

39:51.563 --> 39:54.827
that kicked them out because
of their sexual identity,

39:54.870 --> 39:56.350
that kind of shunned them,
you know,

39:56.394 --> 39:59.135
it was a religious background --
shocking --

39:59.179 --> 40:01.355
I thought that was
a huge statement,

40:01.399 --> 40:03.966
to know that someone
is engaging in sex work

40:04.010 --> 40:05.707
not because they
don't have money,

40:05.751 --> 40:08.057
not because they're
trying to survive,

40:08.101 --> 40:11.147
but because they want to
have some level of intimacy

40:11.191 --> 40:13.454
with an individual
that needs them.

40:26.772 --> 40:32.038
I was not aware of what
went on in West Hollywood.

40:34.867 --> 40:38.784
I was not aware of white gay men
using crystal meth

40:38.827 --> 40:41.177
to bait young Black gay men

40:41.221 --> 40:43.963
and use them as their
little toys or whatever.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.052
I was not aware of all of that.

40:49.098 --> 40:51.013
And it's just proof that,

40:51.057 --> 40:53.842
just because we say
we're in the fight

40:53.886 --> 40:56.584
or say that we're out there
being advocates,

40:56.628 --> 40:58.499
our eyes are not everywhere.

40:59.718 --> 41:04.505
And unfortunately with Gemmel,
he lost his life as a result.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.812
This is something that
shouldn't have happened.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.687
It just shouldn't have happened.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.081
My son filed police reports.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.606
He cried out to so many people,

41:18.650 --> 41:21.304
and we all failed him.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.750
There is no such thing
as a Black victim.

41:31.793 --> 41:35.057
So, you know, you kind of
got to start from there.

41:35.101 --> 41:37.712
Like, what is a Black
victim in this country?

41:39.888 --> 41:41.542
-- What do you want?
-- Justice!

41:41.586 --> 41:43.413
-- When do you want it?
-- Now!

41:43.457 --> 41:44.806
-- What do you want?
-- Justice!

41:44.850 --> 41:48.723
-- When do you want it?
-- Now!

41:48.767 --> 41:52.684
No justice, no peace!

41:52.727 --> 41:55.295
No racist police!

41:55.338 --> 41:57.819
Gemmel Moore! Gemmel Moore!

41:57.863 --> 42:00.648
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

42:00.692 --> 42:03.521
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

42:03.564 --> 42:06.349
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

42:06.393 --> 42:09.135
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

42:09.178 --> 42:13.139
Gemmel Moore!
Gemmel Moore!

42:13.182 --> 42:18.274
Society has never stood up for,
again, a Black victim.

42:18.318 --> 42:21.626
And so I think you
can just easily shift

42:21.669 --> 42:24.846
that whole framing to
this same situation.

42:24.890 --> 42:29.808
Had Ed Buck's victim had
been a white gay man,

42:29.851 --> 42:32.375
not only would you have had

42:32.419 --> 42:34.726
just people up in arms about it,

42:34.769 --> 42:36.728
but you probably would
have seen a lot of those

42:36.771 --> 42:42.168
white-centered LGBT orgs
have more statements about it.

42:42.211 --> 42:43.909
When it comes to the death
of Gemmel Moore,

42:43.952 --> 42:45.606
and the media coverage,

42:45.650 --> 42:47.913
I think a lot of it had to
do with just his connections

42:47.956 --> 42:50.785
in the community
that Ed Buck was not aware of.

42:50.829 --> 42:52.874
Gemmel was known,
Gemmel was loved,

42:52.918 --> 42:56.704
and Gemmel had some very
influential people in his life

42:56.748 --> 42:58.227
that were going to do
what they had to do

42:58.271 --> 43:00.969
to make sure that his
death was not in vain.

43:01.013 --> 43:03.885
Had it not been for Gemmel
and his connections

43:03.929 --> 43:05.626
and who he knew,

43:05.670 --> 43:08.629
this whole situation would
have been swept under the rug,

43:08.673 --> 43:12.764
and it would have happened
again and again and again.

43:12.807 --> 43:15.636
Arrest Ed Buck!
Arrest Ed Buck!

43:15.680 --> 43:19.814
Arrest Ed Buck!
Arrest Ed Buck!

43:19.858 --> 43:21.642
Ed Buck is behind bars

43:21.686 --> 43:23.470
after his arrest overnight.

43:23.513 --> 43:26.168
Buck taken away in handcuffs,

43:26.212 --> 43:28.344
charged with
operating a drug den

43:28.388 --> 43:30.259
out of his West Hollywood home

43:30.303 --> 43:32.044
and providing methamphetamine.

43:32.087 --> 43:35.656
First off, I would like to thank
U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna

43:35.700 --> 43:38.354
and Sheriff Alex Villanueva

43:38.398 --> 43:40.661
for their interagency effort,

43:40.705 --> 43:43.272
which has now culminated
with the arrest

43:43.316 --> 43:47.276
and subsequent filing charges
against defendant Buck.

44:06.426 --> 44:09.385
Unfortunately we can't
bring those Black men back,

44:09.429 --> 44:12.562
but the reality of it is
they're getting the justice

44:12.606 --> 44:13.694
that they deserve.

44:15.130 --> 44:18.090
They are getting the justice
that needs to be served.

44:23.748 --> 44:26.664
The problem with
that is, though, is that

44:26.707 --> 44:28.927
we shouldn't only show up
in their death,

44:28.970 --> 44:31.538
and we shouldn't only
show up in their violence.

44:31.581 --> 44:33.496
We should be showing up
in their life.

44:36.761 --> 44:40.547
People were so fixated on
getting this man in jail,

44:40.590 --> 44:43.942
without addressing
the heap of issues

44:43.985 --> 44:45.813
that are also
involved in this case.

44:47.467 --> 44:50.557
The more further down on
the totem pole you are

44:50.600 --> 44:54.126
when it comes to
being marginalized,

44:54.169 --> 44:56.519
the less your body is valued.

44:56.563 --> 45:01.350
And this had so many components
when it came to sex work,

45:01.394 --> 45:04.658
when it came to drug addiction,
when it came to race,

45:04.702 --> 45:07.617
when it came to gender identity,
when it came to sexuality.

45:09.054 --> 45:11.186
This wasn't just a death.

45:12.231 --> 45:14.450
All of these issues
played a role,

45:14.494 --> 45:16.757
in Timothy and Gemmel's fate.

45:16.801 --> 45:19.238
And they're plaguing
our community,

45:19.281 --> 45:22.850
not just for gay men,
not just for Black gay men,

45:22.894 --> 45:26.506
but our transgender
brothers and sisters

45:26.549 --> 45:29.161
who are right in front of
our faces in our communities

45:29.204 --> 45:31.554
and in your community
all over the world.

45:32.468 --> 45:36.908
Transgender people are being
murdered, and nobody cares.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.571
Everybody needs someone
to make them feel superior.

45:48.615 --> 45:50.486
That line ends with us, though.

45:50.530 --> 45:53.098
The shit runs downhill,
past the women,

45:53.141 --> 45:55.317
the Blacks, Latins, gays,

45:55.361 --> 45:58.146
until it reaches the bottom
and lands on our kind.

45:59.974 --> 46:02.150
I have been to jail!

46:02.194 --> 46:06.807
I been raped and beaten
many times

46:06.851 --> 46:10.768
by men, heterosexual men!

46:10.811 --> 46:15.337
I have lost my job,
I have lost my apartment

46:15.381 --> 46:16.643
for gay liberation!

46:16.686 --> 46:19.167
And you all treat me this way?!

46:19.211 --> 46:21.779
What the fuck's wrong
with you all?

46:21.822 --> 46:23.998
Think about that!

46:24.042 --> 46:25.957
And investigators
are looking into a hate crime

46:26.000 --> 46:28.220
after three transgender women
were attacked,

46:28.263 --> 46:29.830
and one allegedly robbed.

46:29.874 --> 46:32.006
The victims say,
instead of helping them,

46:32.050 --> 46:33.529
witnesses mocked them.

46:33.573 --> 46:35.183
Hate crimes directed

46:35.227 --> 46:39.274
at transgender individuals
increased 42% in one year.

46:39.318 --> 46:41.581
Two men have been
arrested in the murders

46:41.624 --> 46:43.844
of two transgender women
this month.

46:43.888 --> 46:46.368
We're getting a first look
at one of the suspects.

46:46.412 --> 46:48.849
This is Dontarius Long.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.546
Jaida Peterson
was shot and killed

46:50.590 --> 46:53.114
outside this Quality Inn
on Queen City Drive.

46:53.158 --> 46:55.464
With the support of
the LBGT community,

46:55.508 --> 46:57.031
support of the
Richmond Police Department,

46:57.075 --> 46:58.685
as you can see out here
with the community,

46:58.728 --> 47:00.556
we're going to continue
to keep looking.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.863
And all those who love the Lord
would say amen!

47:02.907 --> 47:04.473
Amen!

47:25.973 --> 47:27.670
There was nothing
for me coming up.

47:28.802 --> 47:31.892
There was no sisterhood
of trans organizations.

47:31.936 --> 47:35.156
There were no clubs that
really catered to people

47:35.200 --> 47:37.898
that I identify with.

47:37.942 --> 47:40.727
And that in itself
speaks volumes.

47:40.770 --> 47:44.122
So it takes entertainment for
someone to take us seriously,

47:44.165 --> 47:46.124
but this subject matter
has been going on

47:46.167 --> 47:47.560
since the beginning of time.

47:47.603 --> 47:50.563
And to be honest with you,
it is, as we say,

47:50.606 --> 47:52.391
at the bottom of the totem pole.

47:52.434 --> 47:56.264
It is the community that needs
the most help, the most help.

47:56.308 --> 47:59.050
Any one of us could've
had this card in life.

47:59.093 --> 48:00.921
Any one of our family members
could have had

48:00.965 --> 48:02.531
this card in life.

48:02.575 --> 48:06.231
Any one of us can still
have this card in life.

48:06.274 --> 48:10.670
There should be just as
much energy from Black people

48:10.713 --> 48:12.541
from the LGBT community

48:12.585 --> 48:14.717
that are out there
protesting for Gemmel Moore,

48:14.761 --> 48:17.459
Timothy Dean,
all those people.

48:17.503 --> 48:21.550
And it seems to fall short
when it comes to

48:21.594 --> 48:23.030
the lower you are

48:23.074 --> 48:26.425
in the marginalized identities
that you hold.

48:28.427 --> 48:33.040
When it comes to
the Black community

48:33.084 --> 48:38.219
showing up for
the Black trans community...

48:40.787 --> 48:42.876
...do I believe that
they're showing up?

48:48.012 --> 48:51.058
No. No.

48:51.102 --> 48:52.364
I have a friend
who identifies,

48:52.407 --> 48:53.887
he's Puerto Rican and Black,

48:53.931 --> 48:57.325
a gay male, engaged to a man.

48:57.369 --> 48:59.414
And we've had conversations
around his support

48:59.458 --> 49:02.678
of the current
presidential administration

49:02.722 --> 49:05.464
and their war on LGBT people

49:05.507 --> 49:09.250
and their beginnings
with the trans community.

49:09.294 --> 49:10.860
And his response was,

49:10.904 --> 49:13.863
"Well, they're not part
of the LGBT community."

49:13.907 --> 49:15.517
Like, "What are you talking
about? They're the 'T.'"

49:15.561 --> 49:17.955
Like, that doesn't make
any kind of sense to me.

49:21.567 --> 49:24.178
Does the LGB community
support the "T"?

49:24.222 --> 49:25.353
No.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.139
That was the answer.

49:30.315 --> 49:32.186
As a Black gay man,

49:32.230 --> 49:36.538
I find it funny
that so many of us

49:36.582 --> 49:40.499
do not really get involved
in transgender issues.

49:40.542 --> 49:44.242
We don't really take the time
to understand the challenges,

49:44.285 --> 49:45.983
the struggles, the obstacles.

49:47.897 --> 49:50.857
I oftentimes think about
my challenges, you know,

49:50.900 --> 49:53.338
with with cisgender
heterosexual men

49:53.381 --> 49:55.340
and them understanding
my gayness.

49:55.383 --> 49:59.387
The same grace should be
extended to transgender persons,

49:59.431 --> 50:01.476
especially transgender
persons of color.

50:03.478 --> 50:07.091
I was on set, and there
was a group of male dancers

50:07.134 --> 50:09.049
that didn't know my truth.

50:09.093 --> 50:11.965
They didn't know that I was
a woman of trans experience.

50:13.314 --> 50:15.403
And some of the other dancers
that were there

50:15.447 --> 50:17.840
that did identify as gay

50:17.884 --> 50:21.888
had basically disclosed
my truth to these people,

50:21.931 --> 50:23.411
which could have put me
in harm's way,

50:23.455 --> 50:25.457
which could have caused
me to be hurt,

50:25.500 --> 50:27.111
you know,
in the parking lot.

50:27.154 --> 50:31.158
At the end of lunch,
that entire room had shifted.

50:31.202 --> 50:32.768
No one was talking to me.

50:32.812 --> 50:34.814
People were saying
little remarks to me,

50:34.857 --> 50:37.425
and I saw those
gay men snickering.

50:41.429 --> 50:44.084
And I think that a lot
of cisgender people

50:44.128 --> 50:47.131
think there we're
all this happy family

50:47.174 --> 50:48.958
under this beautiful rainbow.

50:50.656 --> 50:53.050
And it's not -- it's not true.

51:01.841 --> 51:05.540
We weren't necessarily
raised to feel

51:05.584 --> 51:07.151
that we belonged
in this community.

51:07.194 --> 51:11.677
So a lot of times you learn
these tactics of survival

51:11.720 --> 51:14.549
that aren't necessarily healthy,

51:14.593 --> 51:18.075
for, you know,
the simple fact of surviving,

51:18.118 --> 51:20.425
for the simple fact of not being
able to be hired somewhere.

51:28.172 --> 51:30.304
So what are you going to do?

51:30.348 --> 51:33.655
If you're being discriminated
against because of who you are

51:33.699 --> 51:36.963
and no one will hire you,
but you still need to eat,

51:37.006 --> 51:39.792
your natural instinct
to survive will kick in.

51:39.835 --> 51:41.924
And what do you have?
You have your body.

51:43.187 --> 51:44.753
I'm a prostitute.

51:46.929 --> 51:50.150
And, but I'm taking
care of myself.

51:50.194 --> 51:52.500
We're all prostitutes.

51:52.544 --> 51:54.067
It's a fact.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.852
That's what mainly most
of these transsexuals --

51:56.896 --> 52:01.335
not most, all -- start off
prostituting, you know,

52:01.379 --> 52:05.078
making money out here
to support themselves.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.558
It's the truth.

52:06.601 --> 52:08.168
You know, you can joke
off of it here and there,

52:08.212 --> 52:09.648
and stuff like that,
but it's the truth,

52:09.691 --> 52:11.171
and you go through
a lot of danger,

52:11.215 --> 52:13.695
but it's just a fact of life

52:13.739 --> 52:18.091
being for the discrimination
out in the world.

52:18.135 --> 52:21.181
No matter how lovely you can
be, you know what I mean,

52:21.225 --> 52:24.141
how real, how beautiful
you can be,

52:24.184 --> 52:26.360
you will always be discriminated
for the simple fact

52:26.404 --> 52:28.145
that you're a transsexual.

52:29.798 --> 52:32.105
I felt like
I could not get a job

52:32.149 --> 52:33.715
because I was transgender,

52:33.759 --> 52:36.240
because there's a phobia
when it comes to transgenders.

52:37.328 --> 52:39.895
And it held me back
for a long time.

52:39.939 --> 52:42.768
I had surrendered to the
fact that, "You know what?

52:42.811 --> 52:47.773
I'm just going to
be a sex worker and just...

52:47.816 --> 52:49.209
Like, this is it."

52:49.253 --> 52:54.171
I really came to that
point of just surrender.

52:54.214 --> 52:56.303
"I'm going to do drugs,

52:56.347 --> 52:57.826
and I'm gonna prostitute.

52:57.870 --> 52:59.176
That's it."

53:03.267 --> 53:06.574
I filled out numerous
applications for places.

53:07.662 --> 53:10.448
And I had an interview
at Victoria's Secret.

53:12.101 --> 53:15.061
But Victoria's Secret
told me that

53:15.104 --> 53:17.019
they would not call
me by my girl name.

53:17.063 --> 53:19.500
They're going to call
me by the I.D. I had

53:19.544 --> 53:22.851
prior to the application.

53:24.288 --> 53:27.378
And I told them, "No,
you will not call me that."

53:27.421 --> 53:30.163
And I done did
this over and over,

53:30.207 --> 53:32.687
and ended up, like,
finding sex work.

53:32.731 --> 53:36.604
A friend told me about it,
and the money was great,

53:36.648 --> 53:37.953
and that's what I did.

53:45.004 --> 53:47.136
Being a Black trans woman
in the music industry,

53:47.180 --> 53:51.140
I've faced countless
examples of discrimination.

53:51.184 --> 53:53.099
One particular
was that I was invited

53:53.142 --> 53:55.406
into a producing-writing room,

53:55.449 --> 54:00.019
and it was just me and
this well-known producer

54:00.062 --> 54:01.281
at the time.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.196
I was just happy
to be in the space,

54:03.240 --> 54:06.460
to be presented
that opportunity.

54:06.504 --> 54:08.984
But then I realized
that that said producer

54:09.028 --> 54:12.727
did not know the fullness
of my existence,

54:12.771 --> 54:14.163
which means he did not know

54:14.207 --> 54:16.514
that I was a powerful
Black trans woman.

54:16.557 --> 54:19.865
And I saw the switch

54:19.908 --> 54:22.476
soon as I divulged
more of my truth.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.999
My talent went out the door,

54:24.043 --> 54:26.175
singing ability
went out the door.

54:26.219 --> 54:28.352
My production ability
went out the door,

54:28.395 --> 54:32.443
all on the notion
of understanding

54:32.486 --> 54:34.271
because I was
a Black trans woman.

54:41.147 --> 54:44.455
I had really hit a bottom
in downtown L.A.

54:47.240 --> 54:49.982
And I remember
sliding down the wall,

54:50.025 --> 54:52.245
and I was like, "Is this
where my life is going to go?"

54:54.465 --> 54:55.553
And...

54:58.207 --> 55:01.036
I was just like, "No, I just
can't be on the streets

55:01.080 --> 55:02.777
of downtown L.A."

55:02.821 --> 55:04.649
I wasn't gonna allow
that to happen.

55:05.780 --> 55:10.132
So I started going to
the streets of Hollywood.

55:11.656 --> 55:14.267
The girls, they were sassy
and they were funky,

55:14.311 --> 55:17.009
and I was attracted to that.

55:17.052 --> 55:21.100
And I started doing drugs,

55:21.143 --> 55:26.366
and I started getting into
this lifestyle of prostitution

55:26.410 --> 55:29.369
because it was only something
I can do with drugs.

55:29.413 --> 55:34.592
I remember I did
weed, I did shrooms,

55:34.635 --> 55:38.900
I did acid, I did PCP.

55:38.944 --> 55:40.293
I've done it all.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.991
But once I got to
crystal meth, it was...

55:44.210 --> 55:45.472
That was all it took.

55:52.392 --> 55:55.395
It made my transition
just a little bit easier.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.571
I didn't care so much
about being liked

55:57.615 --> 56:01.358
or whether it was okay to
walk down the street anymore,

56:01.401 --> 56:03.360
because it made it okay.

56:03.403 --> 56:07.929
I could hop into cars, I can
get paid for sex, you know?

56:07.973 --> 56:09.409
And after a while,

56:09.453 --> 56:13.239
I started to connect
prostitution with love.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.284
I felt like I can get
love through this.

56:15.328 --> 56:17.939
I felt like if a guy
was giving me money,

56:17.983 --> 56:20.551
he was showing me some
type of attention or love,

56:20.594 --> 56:23.641
which was something I was
lacking for many years.

56:25.077 --> 56:28.776
And that's kind of
how it started.

56:36.175 --> 56:37.350
Cindy-rella.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.395
Looks like someone
has a crush.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.832
Cindy's back on the block?

56:40.875 --> 56:42.094
Oh, yeah, she's back.

56:48.666 --> 56:50.015
How much?
Honey, thousands.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.059
Sorry?

56:56.195 --> 56:58.066
Do you want to say that
in a complete sentence?

56:58.110 --> 56:59.764
Yeah, the money was like

56:59.807 --> 57:03.028
over thousands and thousands
of dollars.

57:03.071 --> 57:04.812
Nonstop.

57:04.856 --> 57:06.248
Day and night.

57:08.207 --> 57:11.515
I used the money for my mother
and my sister.

57:11.558 --> 57:14.822
For drugs, hotel room,

57:14.866 --> 57:19.174
the money was reused
for food and drugs.

57:23.875 --> 57:28.183
The girls would just be
wearing their Daisy Dukes.

57:28.227 --> 57:31.143
You could just be out there
at00 in the morning.

57:33.232 --> 57:38.063
I mean, it was just a setup
for prostitution.

57:38.106 --> 57:39.847
There was the adult bookstore,

57:39.891 --> 57:43.982
there was a Donut Time where
all the girls would hang out.

57:44.025 --> 57:46.985
There's Benito's.

57:47.028 --> 57:48.595
And when I was out there,

57:48.639 --> 57:52.251
there was Del Taco across
the street, there was Arena.

57:52.294 --> 57:57.474
Like, it was just
the hub of everything.

57:59.432 --> 58:04.481
Prostitution, drugs,
the party life, the fast life.

58:06.831 --> 58:09.137
It took me places I never
thought I would go.

58:13.315 --> 58:15.622
And then it just
stopped working for me.

58:22.455 --> 58:23.891
Hello?

58:25.284 --> 58:28.069
You want to see me?
I'm available now.

58:28.113 --> 58:31.159
Darling, my minimum is $150.

58:31.203 --> 58:32.857
Is that a problem?

58:32.900 --> 58:36.077
Well, how generous can
you be on negotiable?

58:36.121 --> 58:38.123
You're really horny?

58:38.166 --> 58:39.777
So am I.

58:40.821 --> 58:45.696
You want to be raped? I don't
have a problem with doing that.

58:48.133 --> 58:50.744
You've been with hundreds of
women and seven transsexuals,

58:50.788 --> 58:53.747
and the transsexuals turn
you on more than women?

58:53.791 --> 58:55.967
Okay, are you ready
to come see me now?

58:56.010 --> 58:57.925
Okay, great.

58:57.969 --> 58:59.274
So I'm gonna run in the house

58:59.318 --> 59:00.841
and put on something
real sexy, honey.

59:00.885 --> 59:03.191
Yes, I got whips,

59:03.235 --> 59:06.064
paddles, dildos, handcuffs,
all of that.

59:07.413 --> 59:09.284
All right, baby, well,
come and get it.

59:09.328 --> 59:10.372
Bye-bye.

59:12.157 --> 59:14.115
Oh, duty calls.

59:14.942 --> 59:16.683
It's a job.
It's a living, honey.

59:16.727 --> 59:18.032
Pays the bills.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.040
You're literally
in the world alone.

59:27.999 --> 59:31.655
And so if you're
constantly getting fed that

59:31.698 --> 59:34.962
by the notions of
what society gives you,

59:35.006 --> 59:37.095
you then sometimes believe that,

59:37.138 --> 59:41.316
and then you go into a certain
space of the negative,

59:41.360 --> 59:44.406
and that can lead you
into so many things

59:44.450 --> 59:46.234
that are detrimental
to your life.

59:47.801 --> 59:52.458
When you have to wake up
every single day, okay,

59:52.501 --> 59:55.809
and take about
20 to 30 clients a day --

59:55.853 --> 59:58.507
sex work, not something
you wanted to do --

59:58.551 --> 59:59.900
when you have to
do that every day

59:59.944 --> 1:00:02.294
just to keep a dirty motel
over your head

1:00:02.337 --> 1:00:05.166
and you have to succumb
to sex work to survive...

1:00:05.819 --> 1:00:08.996
...your only coping is drugs.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:12.826
I know that some gay-identified
individuals do drugs

1:00:12.870 --> 1:00:15.089
to cope with depression,

1:00:15.133 --> 1:00:16.874
so I don't want to exclude that,

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:20.051
but I do want to emphasize
that there's a great difference

1:00:20.094 --> 1:00:23.968
in the usage of drugs when it
comes to the trans community

1:00:24.011 --> 1:00:25.186
and the gay community.

1:00:25.230 --> 1:00:27.275
And I think that
that says a lot,

1:00:27.319 --> 1:00:29.495
that here we have a lot of
gay individuals

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:31.540
who do drugs for
the thrill of it,

1:00:31.584 --> 1:00:33.717
so that they feel
a little bit more sexual,

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.109
so they enjoy their sex.

1:00:37.721 --> 1:00:41.202
But the girls, every single day,

1:00:41.246 --> 1:00:42.900
they are giving their
body to someone,

1:00:42.943 --> 1:00:44.684
they're giving a piece
of their soul to someone,

1:00:44.728 --> 1:00:46.512
just to live.

1:00:46.555 --> 1:00:53.127
And so you're setting
human beings up for failure.

1:00:58.002 --> 1:01:00.439
It was Monday morning, and I...

1:01:02.615 --> 1:01:04.443
I didn't have anything to eat.

1:01:06.184 --> 1:01:09.230
And I would have done anything
just to get something to eat.

1:01:11.102 --> 1:01:13.408
And it was just a really
dark moment in my life,

1:01:13.452 --> 1:01:14.975
and I got into this car...

1:01:16.498 --> 1:01:21.416
And I, like any good prostitute,

1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:23.157
you always get your money first.

1:01:24.289 --> 1:01:26.291
And this was one of those times

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:28.162
where I thought I was
gonna get my money first,

1:01:28.206 --> 1:01:29.642
and this guy told me,

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:32.558
"You get out of my car
before I beat you down."

1:01:32.601 --> 1:01:34.821
And as I tried to
get out of the car,

1:01:34.865 --> 1:01:39.608
he proceeded to
sexually assault me

1:01:39.652 --> 1:01:41.654
and beat me up.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:45.484
And it was a very
traumatic situation.

1:01:45.527 --> 1:01:46.833
And then after he was done,

1:01:46.877 --> 1:01:48.792
he tried to run me over
with his car.

1:01:50.576 --> 1:01:53.057
And I called the police.

1:01:54.319 --> 1:01:56.364
And when it comes to safety...

1:01:58.149 --> 1:02:00.064
...it seemed like they
were just kind of just,

1:02:00.107 --> 1:02:02.109
"This is just what happens."

1:02:02.153 --> 1:02:04.242
They didn't do a rape kit.

1:02:04.285 --> 1:02:05.896
They didn't do anything.

1:02:05.939 --> 1:02:09.595
They were just, "Well,
we'll stay here by your side."

1:02:09.638 --> 1:02:12.946
But I think that they had
kind of, you know --

1:02:12.990 --> 1:02:16.297
'cause after that was done, I
had to get back on the streets

1:02:16.341 --> 1:02:17.603
'cause that's all I knew.

1:02:19.474 --> 1:02:21.085
A lot of people
who I grew up with

1:02:21.128 --> 1:02:23.304
are not alive today.

1:02:23.348 --> 1:02:26.133
They have either died from
alcoholism and drug addiction,

1:02:26.177 --> 1:02:29.746
overdoses, or died,
or killed by...

1:02:31.182 --> 1:02:32.574
In the streets.

1:02:34.402 --> 1:02:38.015
Violently sometimes.
Or you know, died of AIDS.

1:02:38.058 --> 1:02:40.104
Tell them,
because I don't want to die.

1:02:40.147 --> 1:02:41.540
You know?

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:43.629
Look, you seen
"Paris Is Burning"? Venus?

1:02:43.672 --> 1:02:45.370
She got killed.

1:02:45.413 --> 1:02:47.415
I don't want to be that way,
you know?

1:02:47.459 --> 1:02:48.721
That's my fear.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.418
It's absolutely crazy.

1:02:50.462 --> 1:02:51.811
You won't hire the girls,

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.900
but they're not supposed
to escort either.

1:02:53.944 --> 1:02:55.728
So what are they
supposed to do, die?

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:57.991
Because that's what
the message gives to me.

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.605
We've seen that as a fact,

1:03:03.649 --> 1:03:06.826
in the hate crimes
and discrimination,

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.088
in the murders.

1:03:08.132 --> 1:03:09.655
And that saddens me.

1:03:09.698 --> 1:03:12.701
It saddens me that,
as a community,

1:03:12.745 --> 1:03:15.487
we still in 2021, don't know how
to come together.

1:03:24.626 --> 1:03:27.542
I needed to talk about
Iyanna Dior.

1:03:33.635 --> 1:03:37.857
Black transgender
that was assaulted

1:03:37.901 --> 1:03:40.860
by over 30 men
in a convenience store

1:03:40.904 --> 1:03:44.516
where we're protesting
for "Black Lives Matter"

1:03:44.559 --> 1:03:46.997
because a Black man
was shot by the police.

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.000
But meanwhile,
we're in a convenience store

1:03:50.043 --> 1:03:53.351
beating down
a Black transgender female.

1:03:53.394 --> 1:03:55.788
They tried to justify it,

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:58.791
that is justified that
a Black transgender

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:03.230
gets beat down by men that
are three times her size?

1:04:04.101 --> 1:04:06.277
Black people.
This is Black people.

1:04:08.670 --> 1:04:11.195
And when I saw that, I was...

1:04:12.674 --> 1:04:14.328
I was like, "That could be me."

1:04:19.159 --> 1:04:20.944
The thing that
hurts me the most

1:04:20.987 --> 1:04:27.341
is that I got to face white
supremacy from the white men.

1:04:27.385 --> 1:04:30.736
Then I got to turn
around and face...

1:04:32.694 --> 1:04:35.001
...hatred from my own Black,
you know?

1:04:35.045 --> 1:04:38.178
So, I think what people don't
understand with trans women

1:04:38.222 --> 1:04:41.225
is that it's hard.

1:04:41.268 --> 1:04:43.923
With me, not even
feeling included,

1:04:43.967 --> 1:04:47.318
I know that it is my duty
to still stand up

1:04:47.361 --> 1:04:52.279
for Black lives, Black lives
protests and movements

1:04:52.323 --> 1:04:54.847
because I'm Black first.

1:04:58.503 --> 1:05:00.940
But the ways that
Black cis women

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:03.247
have showed up for trans women,

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:06.032
doesn't align with
the spirit of womanhood

1:05:06.076 --> 1:05:07.947
that I think we have
as Black women,

1:05:07.991 --> 1:05:12.038
the experience of
oppression that we have.

1:05:13.431 --> 1:05:16.738
It's been adversarial,

1:05:16.782 --> 1:05:21.918
that Black trans women somehow
take away our womanhood.

1:05:40.371 --> 1:05:42.808
It's a reciprocation thing

1:05:42.851 --> 1:05:44.766
that I specifically don't get

1:05:44.810 --> 1:05:47.508
from certain members
within my own community.

1:05:51.164 --> 1:05:54.820
It feels sometimes as if,
"Oh, Black liberation,"

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:58.258
but you're still other,
like I'm still othered.

1:05:58.302 --> 1:06:02.480
And so it gets very
challenging to, you know,

1:06:02.523 --> 1:06:04.743
to get out there and march
and things

1:06:04.786 --> 1:06:06.527
when you know,

1:06:06.571 --> 1:06:09.487
I know inherently that if the
shoe were on the other foot,

1:06:09.530 --> 1:06:11.402
no one would bat an eyelash.

1:06:17.451 --> 1:06:20.019
I'm so sorry, I don't want to
take this away from you,

1:06:20.063 --> 1:06:21.716
but let me tell you something,

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:23.675
Black trans women are being
killed in this country.

1:06:23.718 --> 1:06:26.765
And CNN, you have erased
Black trans women,

1:06:26.808 --> 1:06:27.984
for the last time!

1:06:28.027 --> 1:06:29.420
Let me tell you something.

1:06:29.463 --> 1:06:33.076
Black trans women are dying!
Our lives matter!

1:06:33.119 --> 1:06:35.904
I'm an extraordinary
Black trans woman,

1:06:35.948 --> 1:06:37.689
and I deserve to be here!

1:06:37.732 --> 1:06:39.908
My Black trans sisters
that are here,

1:06:39.952 --> 1:06:41.040
I am tired!

1:06:41.084 --> 1:06:42.433
I am so tired!

1:06:42.476 --> 1:06:43.738
-I was just sitting there.
-Ma'am.

1:06:43.782 --> 1:06:45.827
It's not just my Black trans
women.

1:06:45.871 --> 1:06:47.916
With my Black trans brothers
too!

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.180
And I'm gonna say
what I'm gonna say!

1:07:32.309 --> 1:07:34.311
LT.The early morning
hours of June 13th,

1:07:34.354 --> 1:07:38.184
essentially our officers, right
before00 a.m. on June 13th,

1:07:38.228 --> 1:07:39.881
they get a call for a man down.

1:07:39.925 --> 1:07:42.101
Officer responds to that area,

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:44.582
which is essentially in
this east Akron area

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:46.540
near the University of Akron.

1:07:46.584 --> 1:07:48.020
And the officer got there,

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:50.979
and they found Mr. Powers
down on the ground,

1:07:51.023 --> 1:07:53.330
unresponsive,
with apparent gunshot wounds,

1:07:53.373 --> 1:07:54.722
and he was deceased.

1:08:21.619 --> 1:08:23.621
I told you I did a deep dive
last night

1:08:23.664 --> 1:08:25.013
trying to figure out --

1:08:25.057 --> 1:08:26.580
"Now, of course
this has been solved."

1:08:26.624 --> 1:08:28.452
You know, it's a big city.

1:08:31.063 --> 1:08:33.718
I'm just amazed, and I'm just...

1:08:33.761 --> 1:08:36.677
There's no suspect,
there's no arrest.

1:08:40.159 --> 1:08:44.511
Maybe I shouldn't be, like,
shocked, but...

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:08.056
He would light up a room
when he came in.

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:12.322
He was very loud, very
boisterous, very colorful.

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:15.281
And you couldn't be sad
around him, you know?

1:09:15.325 --> 1:09:17.065
Even if he was sad and
going through something,

1:09:17.109 --> 1:09:19.416
he wanted to make sure you
were feeling good and happy.

1:09:19.459 --> 1:09:21.766
You know, he was very strong.

1:09:23.246 --> 1:09:25.639
And I told him I was
proud of him for that,

1:09:25.683 --> 1:09:27.250
because I know it
had to be hard,

1:09:27.293 --> 1:09:31.993
to be who he was in
the '80s and the '90s

1:09:32.037 --> 1:09:33.473
and even the 2000s.

1:09:33.517 --> 1:09:37.085
He was, you know --
he was a gay Black man,

1:09:37.129 --> 1:09:39.087
gay Black transgender man,

1:09:39.131 --> 1:09:42.090
that was 6'2" from South Akron.

1:09:42.134 --> 1:09:44.745
And you know,
that's a rougher side of town.

1:09:44.789 --> 1:09:47.400
You know, you tough when
you come from South Akron,

1:09:47.444 --> 1:09:49.707
so he thought
he had to be tough,

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.013
but he was the sweetest person.

1:09:59.804 --> 1:10:02.154
The first big thing
I remember is Brian --

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:03.851
my dad was like, "Come on, guys.
We only got 20 minutes.

1:10:03.895 --> 1:10:06.071
Pick your toy.
We got to get to this movie."

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:07.768
And Brian was standing
in front of these trucks,

1:10:07.812 --> 1:10:10.554
and he was like, "I don't
want a truck, Vivian."

1:10:10.597 --> 1:10:13.774
I said, "Okay, what do you want?

1:10:13.818 --> 1:10:15.254
We've got 20 minutes,
you got to come on."

1:10:15.298 --> 1:10:17.430
"I don't want a truck.
I want a My Little Pony.

1:10:17.474 --> 1:10:21.260
So why don't you tell dad
that you want My Little Pony?"

1:10:21.304 --> 1:10:23.001
He got the toy,
he put it on the counter,

1:10:23.044 --> 1:10:24.959
he said, "Dad,
I don't want a truck."

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.787
He said, "Okay," while he's
going through his wallet.

1:10:26.831 --> 1:10:28.267
He said, "I want
My Little Pony."

1:10:28.311 --> 1:10:29.573
He said, "Well, Brian,
pick the one you want.

1:10:29.616 --> 1:10:31.052
Come on, we got to go!"

1:10:32.228 --> 1:10:34.665
At first he was Brian,
and he was Pocahontas.

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:36.275
He wanted Pocahontas hair.

1:10:36.319 --> 1:10:38.756
Then he was Brian,
the boy Beyoncé.

1:10:38.799 --> 1:10:40.410
Then he was Egypt.

1:10:40.453 --> 1:10:42.890
You know, it just depended
on how he felt as he grew.

1:10:42.934 --> 1:10:44.283
And then later in years
he would say,

1:10:44.327 --> 1:10:45.545
"Okay, I'm gay.
I'm transgender, honey.

1:10:45.589 --> 1:10:47.286
I'm everything. I'm everything.

1:10:47.330 --> 1:10:48.896
I'm mother, honey.
I'm just everything."

1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:51.072
That's how
he would talk.

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:53.553
I didn't know he was Egypt

1:10:53.597 --> 1:10:55.120
until I was passing
flyers around

1:10:55.163 --> 1:10:56.991
and someone said,
"Is that Egypt?"

1:10:57.035 --> 1:10:59.298
I'm like, "Egypt?"
Said, "Yeah, that's Egypt."

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:00.995
So, that's how I knew.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.266
He had all of our staff
and half of the security guards

1:11:10.309 --> 1:11:11.702
in laughter and tears

1:11:11.745 --> 1:11:14.357
because he was like
creating his comedy show.

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:17.621
I would bring him on
just so we could laugh.

1:11:17.664 --> 1:11:19.927
You know, he was just fun.
He was a fun guy.

1:11:21.799 --> 1:11:27.370
Someone that anyone
would want on their team.

1:11:27.413 --> 1:11:30.286
He was a great
productive member of society.

1:11:31.243 --> 1:11:35.073
His personal choices
should not have interfered

1:11:35.116 --> 1:11:36.466
with his living his life.

1:11:38.032 --> 1:11:40.296
And it caused...

1:11:42.123 --> 1:11:44.300
...our world to be empty.

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:00.577
I kissed it. I did.

1:12:02.187 --> 1:12:04.581
You just playing?

1:12:04.624 --> 1:12:07.845
I did.
Okay.

1:12:07.888 --> 1:12:09.455
Okay.

1:12:09.499 --> 1:12:12.023
He was self-medicating,
you know,

1:12:12.066 --> 1:12:13.329
for lack of a better word.

1:12:13.372 --> 1:12:15.635
He had a lot of hurt

1:12:15.679 --> 1:12:17.071
and a lot of things that he
wouldn't let me in on

1:12:17.115 --> 1:12:18.769
until later in years,

1:12:18.812 --> 1:12:21.772
'cause I don't know if he
didn't want to hurt my feelings

1:12:21.815 --> 1:12:23.034
or didn't want me to worry,

1:12:23.077 --> 1:12:25.166
or if it was
embarrassing to him.

1:12:25.210 --> 1:12:27.255
Even though he was comfortable
with who he was,

1:12:27.299 --> 1:12:30.911
I know he still
had, you know, pain,

1:12:30.955 --> 1:12:32.348
and, you know, heartache.

1:12:34.262 --> 1:12:35.699
He was always
looking for a job,

1:12:35.742 --> 1:12:38.745
and he always seemed to
run into an obstacle

1:12:38.789 --> 1:12:40.356
because he was who he was.

1:12:40.399 --> 1:12:45.578
You know, he couldn't turn
off being Egypt or Brian.

1:12:45.622 --> 1:12:48.581
He's not going to show
up to a job in full Egypt gear,

1:12:48.625 --> 1:12:50.278
but he's still very feminine.

1:12:50.322 --> 1:12:52.716
So it pushed him into
doing other things.

1:12:56.807 --> 1:12:59.679
He solicited, he boosted.

1:12:59.723 --> 1:13:01.594
The boy could lift
your watch off you

1:13:01.638 --> 1:13:03.248
with you looking at him.

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:05.032
He would go to Walmart
and steal everything.

1:13:05.076 --> 1:13:07.426
I'm like, "Brian,
stop doing that!"

1:13:07.470 --> 1:13:09.428
"I got to make my money.
I'm going to go sell this."

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:10.603
He was good.

1:13:10.647 --> 1:13:12.823
That's not a proud thing to say,

1:13:12.866 --> 1:13:14.912
but he did what he
had to do to survive.

1:13:17.523 --> 1:13:19.612
And he would say,
"Honey, I get out there

1:13:19.656 --> 1:13:21.788
and I get dressed up
and I'm gonna do me."

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:24.443
If you seen him when
he was in his heyday,

1:13:24.487 --> 1:13:28.752
that boy looked like
a 6'2" gorgeous female.

1:13:28.795 --> 1:13:30.318
That's what scared me.

1:13:30.362 --> 1:13:32.146
I'm like, "You're going
to run into these men,

1:13:32.190 --> 1:13:35.149
and they gonna find out, Brian,
and they're gonna kill you."

1:13:35.193 --> 1:13:36.890
He was like,
"Vivian, they know."

1:13:37.804 --> 1:13:40.633
And the way he would look at me,
you know, I'm big sister,

1:13:40.677 --> 1:13:42.766
I'm like, "No, they don't.
Look at you. You're gorgeous.

1:13:42.809 --> 1:13:45.986
They don't know, Brian!
You're not in a gay club.

1:13:46.030 --> 1:13:47.423
You're in a regular, you know,

1:13:47.466 --> 1:13:48.511
what they call
a regular heterosexual --"

1:13:48.554 --> 1:13:50.991
He said, "Vivian, they know."

1:13:51.688 --> 1:13:55.561
A few years went by, and I'm
like, "Oh, shit, they do know."

1:13:58.390 --> 1:14:00.871
But they might not have
wanted the world to know.

1:14:01.915 --> 1:14:04.396
They had their own little
secret world behind doors.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:05.702
But that's what scared me.

1:14:13.536 --> 1:14:15.973
I heard he was at a party
that night.

1:14:19.846 --> 1:14:21.718
As Egypt.

1:14:22.719 --> 1:14:23.850
Yeah.

1:14:27.854 --> 1:14:32.685
If he was younger
and heterosexual,

1:14:32.729 --> 1:14:35.688
I believe it would've
been solved by now.

1:14:35.732 --> 1:14:38.735
Like we said earlier,
if he was an Akron U. student,

1:14:38.778 --> 1:14:39.953
they would have moved
heaven and earth

1:14:39.997 --> 1:14:41.694
to find out who killed him.

1:14:41.738 --> 1:14:44.958
But Akron U's comment was,
"He wasn't a student of ours."

1:14:45.002 --> 1:14:46.699
He was a human being.
So what?

1:14:49.136 --> 1:14:50.529
So he wasn't a student of yours,

1:14:50.573 --> 1:14:51.878
so you're not going
to investigate

1:14:51.922 --> 1:14:53.489
what happened on your campus?

1:14:59.973 --> 1:15:03.150
Because he was a Black man,
and was gay, transgender.

1:15:05.109 --> 1:15:07.503
Outside what society
deems as normal.

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:13.813
It's like, "Oh, he must've
did something to deserve it."

1:15:15.859 --> 1:15:20.167
So, it was hard when it came
out that he did do things,

1:15:20.211 --> 1:15:24.563
sex work and, you know,
or had an issue with drugs,

1:15:24.607 --> 1:15:27.348
because I kept thinking,
"Don't put him in this light."

1:15:30.438 --> 1:15:32.876
And they just gonna
throw him away.

1:16:02.514 --> 1:16:04.603
As of right now,

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:08.172
Black trans people are
living in a state of urgency

1:16:08.215 --> 1:16:12.611
because they don't feel safe.

1:16:12.655 --> 1:16:16.136
They don't feel safe
to be able to live

1:16:16.180 --> 1:16:19.662
and imagine what 65
and 75 will look like.

1:16:22.099 --> 1:16:24.449
We need a talking-to
in our own community

1:16:24.492 --> 1:16:26.190
because we do not show up.

1:16:26.233 --> 1:16:28.627
There has been countless deaths

1:16:28.671 --> 1:16:30.368
when it comes to
trans individuals.

1:16:30.411 --> 1:16:34.894
And it is so crazy to me,

1:16:34.938 --> 1:16:38.028
so crazy that we can
applaud the entertainment

1:16:38.071 --> 1:16:39.638
because it makes us feel good.

1:16:39.682 --> 1:16:41.466
But what are we doing
outside of that?

1:16:41.509 --> 1:16:42.989
What are we doing
outside of that?

1:16:43.033 --> 1:16:45.949
What organizations and
laws are put into place

1:16:45.992 --> 1:16:48.125
for these trans murders to stop?

1:16:48.168 --> 1:16:49.300
I haven't seen any.

1:16:50.301 --> 1:16:51.824
That saddens me.

1:16:51.868 --> 1:16:53.434
This is 2021.

1:16:54.479 --> 1:16:57.830
It's no longer something
that could just be taboo

1:16:57.874 --> 1:17:01.834
and just thrown in the back
of a closet and be like,

1:17:01.878 --> 1:17:04.837
"Oh, Black lives matter,
but trans lives don't."

1:17:04.881 --> 1:17:07.231
It doesn't work like that.

1:17:07.274 --> 1:17:10.277
Black people are being murdered,

1:17:10.321 --> 1:17:13.846
and the reality of it is
all of us should come together.

1:17:13.890 --> 1:17:16.675
There is racism
within the LGBT community.

1:17:16.719 --> 1:17:19.547
There is misogyny within
the LGBT community.

1:17:19.591 --> 1:17:22.681
There is transphobia
within the LGBT community.

1:17:22.725 --> 1:17:25.118
There's homophobia within
the Black community.

1:17:25.162 --> 1:17:27.425
Are you not paying attention
or are you not seeing

1:17:27.468 --> 1:17:29.557
how you are mirroring
the exact same thing

1:17:29.601 --> 1:17:31.603
that you claim to
be fighting against?

1:17:31.647 --> 1:17:34.780
Like you're literally
parroting what you are

1:17:34.824 --> 1:17:36.782
bitching about white people
doing to you.

1:17:36.826 --> 1:17:42.092
You're parroting that onto
other marginalized communities,

1:17:42.135 --> 1:17:43.833
and you don't even see it.

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:45.399
You don't even see it,

1:17:45.443 --> 1:17:47.271
because you're willfully
choosing not to see it.

1:17:47.314 --> 1:17:51.144
We cannot be empowered to
dismantle white supremacy

1:17:51.188 --> 1:17:53.712
but be disempowered to
acknowledge the existence

1:17:53.756 --> 1:17:54.974
of Black trans people.

1:17:55.018 --> 1:17:58.021
Black or brown
trans women of color

1:17:58.064 --> 1:18:01.154
are being murdered
by people like me.

1:18:01.459 --> 1:18:03.113
Cisgender men.

1:18:07.770 --> 1:18:11.512
Often,
here in the United States,

1:18:11.556 --> 1:18:13.863
people know that trans women,

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:16.648
particularly the Black trans
women who've been murdered,

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:21.131
often have some type of
relationship with the murderer.

1:18:22.219 --> 1:18:24.090
It may be a sexual relationship.

1:18:24.134 --> 1:18:26.440
It may just be
a friendly relationship.

1:18:26.484 --> 1:18:29.313
It might just be
you Snapchatting each other.

1:18:29.356 --> 1:18:33.186
But they knew each other
somehow before this happened.

1:18:35.319 --> 1:18:38.322
And I'm saying it more
and more every day,

1:18:38.365 --> 1:18:39.671
that as trans women,

1:18:39.715 --> 1:18:41.107
particularly as
Black trans women,

1:18:41.151 --> 1:18:43.806
if we can't trust
people that we know,

1:18:43.849 --> 1:18:46.199
then who are
we supposed to trust?

1:18:47.505 --> 1:18:49.159
We already have
no respect, in many ways,

1:18:49.202 --> 1:18:50.682
for Black queer people.

1:18:50.726 --> 1:18:54.164
And then there's an
even harsher disrespect

1:18:54.207 --> 1:18:56.644
for people who
identify as trans.

1:18:56.688 --> 1:18:59.517
And the fact that people
feel like they can act out

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:02.650
and murder somebody
is a problem.

1:19:02.694 --> 1:19:04.478
Because we're not holding
those people accountable

1:19:04.522 --> 1:19:05.871
for what they're doing.

1:19:05.915 --> 1:19:07.830
If they're under attack,
we're under attack.

1:19:07.873 --> 1:19:10.789
And you know, that bar,

1:19:10.833 --> 1:19:15.794
it just continues
to harm whomever,

1:19:15.838 --> 1:19:18.710
or who society deems
is the most disposable.

1:19:18.754 --> 1:19:21.147
And that bar can
move at any time.

1:19:21.191 --> 1:19:23.976
That bar in many ways
has affected us.

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:25.717
That is why Ed Buck
was able to do

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:27.327
what Ed Buck was able to do,

1:19:27.371 --> 1:19:30.678
because our disposability
came into question,

1:19:30.722 --> 1:19:36.684
and many people saw us as
a disposable part of humanity.

1:19:39.644 --> 1:19:44.867
I represent a population
that gets killed every day.

1:19:44.910 --> 1:19:46.999
Think about your
privilege in the space

1:19:47.043 --> 1:19:50.786
that you can access to speak
my name and my people's name

1:19:50.829 --> 1:19:52.352
that are not here today.

1:19:52.396 --> 1:19:56.530
and who have paved the way
for all of us to be here.

1:19:57.705 --> 1:20:01.187
I think we have to do
a much better job of, one,

1:20:01.231 --> 1:20:05.626
realizing that intracommunity,
as Black LGBTQ people,

1:20:05.670 --> 1:20:07.367
we have to do a better job,

1:20:07.411 --> 1:20:12.459
if we don't identify as trans,
as supporting, protecting,

1:20:12.503 --> 1:20:17.725
and creating resources
and creating spaces for them

1:20:17.769 --> 1:20:21.904
so that they are
safely among us.

1:20:21.947 --> 1:20:25.211
You have to be grounded
and be humble

1:20:25.255 --> 1:20:28.867
and willing to check in
with yourself every month,

1:20:28.911 --> 1:20:32.566
every week, every year --
how can I better --

1:20:32.610 --> 1:20:34.699
How can I be a better human?

1:20:34.742 --> 1:20:37.136
How can I show up in spaces?

1:20:37.180 --> 1:20:42.228
And if it challenges
your perception, so be it.

1:20:43.403 --> 1:20:46.537
Read, ask questions, talk.

1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:48.408
Don't live in your bubble.

1:20:48.452 --> 1:20:51.194
Don't be confined
to your four walls.

1:20:51.237 --> 1:20:52.978
Learn about things
outside of yourself,

1:20:53.022 --> 1:20:55.763
because once you do that,
that's all you can do.

1:20:55.807 --> 1:20:58.201
Like, I don't know a lot of
stuff till I asked questions,

1:20:58.244 --> 1:20:59.463
till I did the research.

1:20:59.506 --> 1:21:01.769
Do the research.

1:21:03.206 --> 1:21:06.774
And a lot of these
things, you can't go back.

1:21:06.818 --> 1:21:08.211
Once you read certain articles,

1:21:08.254 --> 1:21:10.039
once you have certain
conversations,

1:21:10.082 --> 1:21:12.171
once you see certain
documentaries,

1:21:12.215 --> 1:21:15.261
read certain books,
there is no going back.

1:21:15.305 --> 1:21:16.872
You can't go back to
your comfort of ignorance

1:21:16.915 --> 1:21:18.699
once you're exposed
to certain things.

1:21:18.743 --> 1:21:22.225
Care.
These are people's kids.

1:21:22.268 --> 1:21:24.444
That is the battle that we face,

1:21:24.488 --> 1:21:30.450
because we can't just stay
bubbled into our own space.

1:21:30.494 --> 1:21:33.932
We have to navigate the world
in order to change it.

1:21:42.767 --> 1:21:51.036
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

1:21:52.908 --> 1:21:55.084
-Black lives!
-Louder!

1:21:55.127 --> 1:21:57.086
-Black lives!
-Louder!

1:21:57.129 --> 1:21:58.565
-Black lives!
-Louder!

1:21:58.609 --> 1:22:02.221
-Black queer! Black queer!
-Louder!

1:22:02.265 --> 1:22:05.268
-Black trans! Black trans!
-Louder!

1:22:05.311 --> 1:22:08.488
-Black women! Black women!
-Louder!

1:22:08.532 --> 1:22:11.752
-Black men! Black men!
-Louder!

1:22:11.796 --> 1:22:15.626
-Black children! Black children!
-Louder!

1:22:15.669 --> 1:22:18.194
-Black trans children!
-Louder!

1:22:18.237 --> 1:22:20.848
-Black trans children!
-Louder!

1:22:20.892 --> 1:22:24.156
-Black trans children!
-Louder!

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:28.421
-Trans youth! Trans youth!
-Louder!

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:54.491
This is our time.

1:22:56.623 --> 1:23:01.933
I want trans women, trans men,

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:06.894
gender nonconforming individuals
to feel heard.

1:23:08.113 --> 1:23:09.854
I love you.

1:23:09.897 --> 1:23:13.553
I don't have to know you
personally. I love you.

1:23:13.597 --> 1:23:15.599
Just because you are yourself.

1:23:16.730 --> 1:23:19.385
So keep thriving,
keep believing.

1:23:19.429 --> 1:23:22.867
It's probably always going
to be some level of a fight,

1:23:22.910 --> 1:23:24.869
but you're not alone.

1:23:24.912 --> 1:23:28.525
I see you. I love you.

1:23:28.568 --> 1:23:30.744
That's what I want them to know.

1:23:34.792 --> 1:23:38.404
Can you say, "No more"?

1:23:38.448 --> 1:23:39.884
No more!

1:23:39.927 --> 1:23:41.581
One more time together.

1:23:41.625 --> 1:23:43.583
No more!

1:23:43.627 --> 1:23:44.889
And one more time.

1:23:44.932 --> 1:23:47.413
No more!

1:23:47.457 --> 1:23:50.982
I want him to know
I'm not gonna stop.

1:23:56.292 --> 1:23:58.772
I'm not gonna give up on him,

1:23:58.816 --> 1:24:00.774
'cause he wouldn't
give up on me.

1:24:12.221 --> 1:24:15.920
Tell your Brian,
"God don't make mistakes."

1:24:15.963 --> 1:24:17.487
Hold on to 'em.

1:24:17.530 --> 1:24:19.184
Let them know you love them.

1:24:19.228 --> 1:24:21.534
Let them know that
you're there for them.

1:24:21.578 --> 1:24:24.668
And let them know
that they matter.

1:24:28.715 --> 1:24:34.156
I'm going to do everything I
can do to get him justice.

1:24:34.199 --> 1:24:36.984
'Cause his life was worth it.
He mattered.

1:25:22.029 --> 1:25:24.684
I am sober, two years sober.

1:25:24.728 --> 1:25:26.773
I am working now.

1:25:26.817 --> 1:25:29.994
I'm not a sex worker.
I'm a worker amongst workers.

1:25:30.037 --> 1:25:32.692
I'm a manager at
a grooming salon.

1:25:32.736 --> 1:25:34.955
I go to meetings
every single day

1:25:34.999 --> 1:25:37.436
to help me with my addiction.

1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:42.180
I have a strong support group
that really cares about me.

1:25:42.224 --> 1:25:45.270
And I'm just as free
as the life could be.

1:25:47.229 --> 1:25:50.971
Today I am working.

1:25:51.276 --> 1:25:54.279
I work full-time.

1:25:54.323 --> 1:25:56.325
I'm a manager
at a call center.

1:25:56.368 --> 1:25:58.457
I'm currently going
back to school.

1:25:58.501 --> 1:26:02.113
I'm working on my business
administration degree,

1:26:02.157 --> 1:26:04.376
my associate's in science.

1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:06.161
In the fall I'm
gonna be taking Spanish,

1:26:06.204 --> 1:26:09.642
geography, and psychology.

1:26:12.210 --> 1:26:15.257
I'm sober.
I'm coming up on 10 years.

1:26:16.432 --> 1:26:17.998
I have an amazing life today.

1:26:18.042 --> 1:26:22.742
Recently, in 2018, I was
able to have my sex change.

1:26:22.786 --> 1:26:24.135
And I'm...

1:26:25.615 --> 1:26:28.270
If I could tell you
the feeling that I have

1:26:28.313 --> 1:26:30.141
just being in my own skin,

1:26:30.185 --> 1:26:32.665
like, this is what life's about.

1:26:32.709 --> 1:26:34.711
This is, right here,

1:26:34.754 --> 1:26:39.498
to be able to feel comfortable
in your own skin is just --

1:26:39.542 --> 1:26:41.761
you know, be able to look at
yourself in the mirror

1:26:41.805 --> 1:26:43.459
and just love what you see,

1:26:43.502 --> 1:26:46.592
you just can't
put a price on that.

1:27:21.018 --> 1:27:22.628
"
plays ]

1:30:11.493 --> 1:30:14.452
You tears are beautiful.

1:30:14.496 --> 1:30:18.456
Your scars, they tell a story.

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:21.590
No pain lasts forever.

1:30:21.633 --> 1:30:23.896
You are divinely you,

1:30:23.940 --> 1:30:26.638
and there is no one,
absolutely no one

1:30:26.682 --> 1:30:29.467
that can take your power.

1:30:29.511 --> 1:30:31.208
You are my sister.

1:30:31.251 --> 1:30:32.644
You are my brother.

1:30:32.688 --> 1:30:34.341
You are my friend.

1:30:34.385 --> 1:30:38.128
And I will speak your name
because your life --

1:30:38.171 --> 1:30:41.479
your life has not
been lived in vain.

1:30:41.523 --> 1:30:46.571
Love -- Love is the key that
unlocks a hateful heart.

1:30:47.703 --> 1:30:52.229
So trust -- trust in the deepest
part of your soul

1:30:52.272 --> 1:30:57.843
that all things work together
for those who choose love

1:30:57.887 --> 1:31:02.631
as the key in the solution
to heal mankind.

1:31:04.110 --> 1:31:06.243
You are me.

1:31:06.286 --> 1:31:08.985
And I am you.

1:31:09.028 --> 1:31:12.684
I love you.
I will fight for you.

1:31:12.728 --> 1:31:15.600
I will speak your name.

1:31:15.644 --> 1:31:18.734
My fallen brothers and sisters,
you are not lost.

1:31:18.777 --> 1:31:21.780
We will speak your name.
We love you.
