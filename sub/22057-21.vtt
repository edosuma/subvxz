00:00.750 --> 00:03.870
Previously onHawaii Five-O:
STEVE: Harry Langford.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.490
Does MI6 got some business
in Hawaii we should know about?

00:06.490 --> 00:10.120
Iâ€™ve taken an early pension,
and, um, Iâ€™m traveling the world

00:10.120 --> 00:11.370
enjoying my golden years.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.330
Iâ€™m beginning to suspect
that my retirement

00:14.330 --> 00:15.700
may have been
a little premature.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.490
GROVER:Paris, Munich, London.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.200
This is going to be Chernobyl
times a hundred.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.490
DANNY:Still happy you decided
to spend the day with us?

00:21.490 --> 00:24.120
HARRY:Letâ€™s say I have
a newfound appreciation

00:24.120 --> 00:25.500
for what you boys do.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.080
Uh-oh.
DANNY: What is that?

00:27.080 --> 00:28.950
Is that British for
"everythingâ€™s okay" or what?

00:28.950 --> 00:30.490
Watch your eyes.
DANNY: Oh!

00:30.490 --> 00:33.250
What the hell is
the matter with you?
I fixed it.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.490
Reactorâ€™s stable.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.490
MAN:The George Cross.

00:37.490 --> 00:41.700
Gentlemen, on behalf
of a grateful nation,

00:41.700 --> 00:44.080
we thank you.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.490
â™ª â™ª

00:49.790 --> 00:53.120
â™ª Mailman â™ª

00:53.120 --> 00:59.450
â™ª Bring me no more blues â™ª

00:59.450 --> 01:01.910
â™ª Mailman â™ª

01:01.910 --> 01:06.370
â™ª Bring me no more blues... â™ª

01:06.370 --> 01:09.120
You may want to take
a look at the top one.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.160
It looks a little sketchy.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.490
Iâ€™ll send it up to the lab

01:13.490 --> 01:15.490
for a threat assessment.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.200
Anonymous package,
no return address.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.540
What do you think
the chances are we watch this

01:25.540 --> 01:27.490
and it isnâ€™t deeply disturbing?

01:28.790 --> 01:31.120
Betamax. Got it.

01:31.120 --> 01:31.950
Okay.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.370
All right.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.370
Hey, can you believe
that watching a movie at home

01:37.370 --> 01:40.700
used to mean jumping in the car,
driving to a video store

01:40.700 --> 01:43.620
and hoping that the movie
you wanted to watch

01:43.620 --> 01:44.750
was available to rent?

01:44.750 --> 01:46.490
Yeah, those poor souls.
Seriously.

01:46.490 --> 01:49.200
Nowadays you can just,
you know, fire up your phone

01:49.200 --> 01:51.410
and watch theFast and Furiousfranchise

01:51.410 --> 01:53.870
from the comfort
of your own toilet seat.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.490
Yeah, itâ€™s a great time
to be alive.

01:56.490 --> 01:59.490
And thank you so much
for that mental image.

02:00.490 --> 02:02.290
JUNIOR: Well, you know,
I was hypothetically speaking.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.410
You know, uh,
I obviously donâ€™t do that.

02:04.410 --> 02:05.450
No, of course not.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.580
Should we watch the tape?

02:06.580 --> 02:08.000
Mm-hmm.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.200
TANI:
All right, here we go.

02:15.790 --> 02:16.330
Okay.

02:16.330 --> 02:20.080
Looks like it was taken
from some sort of hidden camera.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.370
(labored breathing,
distorted conversation)

02:24.120 --> 02:26.120
Can you make out
what theyâ€™re saying?

02:28.540 --> 02:31.290
TANI:
No, but can you hear that?

02:31.290 --> 02:32.870
Sounds like breathing.

02:32.870 --> 02:36.200
Itâ€™s coming from
whoever shot this video.

02:39.620 --> 02:43.490
Great. So some perv
just sent us an old sex tape.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.370
No, this isnâ€™t a sex tape.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.250
I think we just
watched a murder.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.330
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song plays)

03:30.620 --> 03:33.660
â™ª â™ª

03:38.370 --> 03:39.910
So?

03:41.290 --> 03:41.580
So?

03:42.580 --> 03:47.080
Do you want to discuss the, uh,
uh, pink donkey in the room?

03:47.080 --> 03:48.580
Thereâ€™s a pink
donkey in the room?

03:48.580 --> 03:50.200
The pink elephant.
You know what I mean?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.490
Whatâ€™s that?
The elephant. The elephant.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.250
What are you talking about?
Noriko.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.500
What about her?

03:54.500 --> 03:55.370
"What about her?"

03:55.370 --> 03:59.490
Well, uh, after everything
she put Adam through, uh,

03:59.490 --> 04:01.490
you think itâ€™s just
a coincidence

04:01.490 --> 04:03.120
that the same day she dies

04:03.120 --> 04:04.410
is the same day
that Adam skips town?

04:04.410 --> 04:07.490
You donâ€™t find that to be
a little cause

04:07.490 --> 04:10.000
Until I have some clear evidence
in front of me

04:10.000 --> 04:11.620
that implicates Adam
in any of this,

04:11.620 --> 04:13.660
thereâ€™s nothing
to discuss, Danny.

04:13.660 --> 04:14.330
Oh.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.620
Well, what about
when you do have

04:15.620 --> 04:17.490
some clear evidence?
Then what?

04:17.490 --> 04:22.000
Then Iâ€™m gonna have a very
difficult decision to make.

04:33.750 --> 04:34.200
Boys.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.090
Hey!
Thanks for coming by.

04:36.090 --> 04:38.640
Great to see you.
Good to see you, man.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.090
Come on.

04:40.090 --> 04:42.140
DANNY:
Nice, uh, spread.
STEVE: Whoa.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.350
STEVE:
Look at this place.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.090
Oh, hello.

04:45.090 --> 04:47.180
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce

04:47.180 --> 04:48.050
Lady Helen Mortimer.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.090
Oh, hi. Hi.
Itâ€™s lovely to
meet you both.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.640
You, too.
Harryâ€™s told me
so much about you.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.930
HARRY:
Back in my MI5 days,

04:53.930 --> 04:56.090
I used to run security
for the Mortimers.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.640
When I found out theyâ€™d be
vacationing in Hawaii,

04:58.640 --> 05:01.260
I, um, thought Iâ€™d pop in
and pay a visit.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.300
And we are thrilled to have him.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.800
Harryâ€™s like family to us.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.260
Well, you guys certainly
draw quite a crowd.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.300
The lobbyâ€™s full
of photographers.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.260
We had to, uh, knock a couple
guys out to get to the elevator.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.850
Mmm. I thought my
days of being chased

05:12.850 --> 05:14.640
by the paparazzi
were long gone.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.090
But then my daughter
hit puberty,

05:16.090 --> 05:17.050
developed a rebellious streak

05:17.050 --> 05:20.760
and suddenly became the favorite
of every tabloid editor.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.850
Mm-hmm.

05:21.850 --> 05:22.930
Oh, and here she is.

05:22.930 --> 05:26.010
Lady Sophieâ€™s just woken up,
so I do apologize

05:26.010 --> 05:27.100
if sheâ€™s a little
bit grumpy.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.430
Just getting ready for
my wild night out on the town.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.470
HARRY:
Lady Sophie, these are

05:31.470 --> 05:34.550
my friends, Steven and Daniel.
Howâ€™s it going?

05:34.550 --> 05:35.890
DANNY: Very good.
Hi.

05:35.890 --> 05:37.220
How are you?
HARRY: You know, um...

05:37.220 --> 05:40.090
Commander McGarrett
and Detective Williams

05:40.090 --> 05:42.510
have both had the honor
of meeting Her Majesty.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.100
STEVE:
Yes, itâ€™s true, we have.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.220
It was, uh... it was
a career highlight for me.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.720
DANNY: Yeah, it
was pretty cool.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.680
We got, uh...
we got medals.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.090
They gave us, uh...
we had fish and chips for lunch.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.430
I liked it a lot.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.300
She had a big sword.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.300
So, let me get
this straight.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.970
Youâ€™re, like, a, um...
like, a royal, um...

05:59.300 --> 06:00.720
I am.
How many people

06:00.720 --> 06:02.470
have to die before you
become the queen?

06:02.470 --> 06:04.100
Hey, hey.
Legitimate question.
Is that a faux pas?

06:04.100 --> 06:06.220
You donâ€™t ask
something like that?

06:06.220 --> 06:07.600
Uh, well...

06:07.600 --> 06:08.260
Itâ€™s fine.

06:08.260 --> 06:11.180
No, the truth is
Iâ€™ve never actually counted.

06:11.180 --> 06:12.430
Ah.
Oh, she has.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.720
Itâ€™s 34.
Mmm, long shot.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.140
SOPHIE:
So, boys...

06:16.140 --> 06:17.720
shall we?

06:17.720 --> 06:18.510
Hmm

06:18.510 --> 06:21.090
Oh, um, about our lunch.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.760
Just a slight change of plan.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.390
â™ª One, respect â™ª

06:24.390 --> 06:26.550
â™ª Better watch every word
on your lips â™ª

06:26.550 --> 06:29.970
â™ª And two, donâ€™t get too ahead
of yourself, not yet â™ª

06:29.970 --> 06:33.510
â™ª Three, I bet you ainâ€™t never
had a touch like this â™ª

06:33.510 --> 06:36.300
â™ª And number four,
stop asking for it... â™ª

06:36.300 --> 06:38.090
Sorry about this, chaps.

06:38.090 --> 06:40.430
This is Lady Sophieâ€™s
standard holiday move.

06:40.430 --> 06:42.510
She underpacks,
and then insists on turning

06:42.510 --> 06:44.600
her first day
into a shopping spree.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.430
Itâ€™s okay.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.350
Are you serious right now?

06:49.350 --> 06:50.850
Iâ€™m hungry.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.090
Oh, yeah, I know.
Weâ€™re all hungry.

06:52.090 --> 06:54.470
Whereâ€™d you get
the animal crackers?

06:54.470 --> 06:55.510
I was with
Charlie today.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.350
And heâ€™s five.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.800
So you have to have snacks
for five-year-old kids,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.850
â€™cause if their blood sugar
drops too low,

07:01.850 --> 07:03.850
they act like, um, psychopaths.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.180
Give me a cracker.
Give me a cracker.
No.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
This is my food.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.350
You know what?
HARRY: Might I suggest...

07:09.350 --> 07:11.180
that when Lady Sophie reappears,

07:11.180 --> 07:14.090
we all agree
that whatever sheâ€™s wearing,

07:14.090 --> 07:16.220
we say it looks fantastic.
Yep.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.090
Then we can all go and eat.

07:18.090 --> 07:20.090
Good idea.

07:20.430 --> 07:23.220
Hey, put â€™em away.

07:23.220 --> 07:24.430
Hey.

07:24.430 --> 07:26.010
Stunning.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.550
That is amazing.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.260
You should get
that outfit.

07:30.510 --> 07:31.390
I donâ€™t know.

07:31.390 --> 07:33.090
Iâ€™m not convinced
by the trousers.

07:33.090 --> 07:34.180
Iâ€™m just not loving the cut.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.680
STEVE:
I like â€™em a lot.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.720
No, youâ€™re right.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.180
I think the
high-waisted jeans

07:40.180 --> 07:40.890
from before.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.220
The pink suede mules are...
are good. Keep those.

07:43.220 --> 07:46.090
And the silk bomber jacket
from three outfits ago.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.930
I think thatâ€™s the jam.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.350
Take note, gents.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.680
This one actually knows
what heâ€™s talking about.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.430
Let me get
everything together,

07:54.430 --> 07:56.090
and weâ€™ll grab that lunch, yeah?

07:56.090 --> 07:57.720
Okay.

08:00.090 --> 08:01.720
How?

08:01.720 --> 08:04.180
Well, um...

08:04.180 --> 08:05.260
I have a 16-year-old daughter,

08:05.260 --> 08:07.890
and I have a really good
sense of style.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.350
I appreciate
your patience, gents.

08:11.350 --> 08:13.010
Lunch is
definitely on me.

08:13.010 --> 08:15.090
Well, given how empty
my stomach is,

08:15.090 --> 08:16.090
itâ€™s probably gonna cost you.

08:16.090 --> 08:18.090
Itâ€™s amazing
where the time goes.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.430
I was there when Sophie
was born, you know.

08:20.430 --> 08:21.430
Watched her grow up.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.850
She was such
a sweet child.

08:23.850 --> 08:26.220
Itâ€™s been a few years
since I last saw her, and, um,

08:26.220 --> 08:28.510
well, letâ€™s just say
sheâ€™s changed quite a bit.

08:28.510 --> 08:29.510
Itâ€™s called
puberty, buddy.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.140
Yeah, my daughterâ€™s a different
person every single day.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.090
Itâ€™s a nightmare.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.090
Hey, I just feel
like itâ€™s my duty

08:35.090 --> 08:36.550
to warn you guys
that my personality

08:36.550 --> 08:39.510
is about to take a...
a serious left-hand turn

08:39.510 --> 08:42.090
if I donâ€™t get some food
into my system.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.600
Agreed.
Thank you.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.220
What was that?
Donâ€™t talk to me

08:48.220 --> 08:51.090
unless you have more
animal crackers.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.090
Sophie?

08:52.090 --> 08:54.890
How we doing in there?

08:57.930 --> 08:59.430
Sophie?

09:03.470 --> 09:05.220
Sophie?

09:11.720 --> 09:14.260
Sheâ€™s gone.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.550
TANI:Based on the video format

09:16.550 --> 09:17.760
and the quality
of the recording,

09:17.760 --> 09:19.970
it looks to be
about 20 to 30 years old.

09:19.970 --> 09:22.090
Yeah, and unfortunately,
we were unable to I.D.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.600
any of the people
in the footage.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.090
GROVER: All right,
first things first.

09:26.090 --> 09:28.010
Are we sure this is even real?

09:28.010 --> 09:29.470
I mean, it certainly
looks that way,

09:29.470 --> 09:31.050
but the only way
to know for sure

09:31.050 --> 09:32.890
is if we talk
to whoever sent it.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.600
And whoever that person is
went through

09:34.600 --> 09:36.050
a lot of trouble
to cover their tracks.

09:36.050 --> 09:38.680
Thereâ€™s no return address,
and according to the lab,

09:38.680 --> 09:40.090
there was no prints
found on the package.

09:40.090 --> 09:42.430
We sent the envelope to CSU
for handwriting analysis,

09:42.430 --> 09:46.090
but the chances that that gets
us an I.D. are slim to none.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.640
All right, for now, letâ€™s say

09:47.640 --> 09:49.720
we treat this
as a genuine murder.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.760
First thing weâ€™re
gonna need to do

09:51.760 --> 09:54.390
is establish
our crime scene.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.640
In order to get a video

09:55.640 --> 09:57.550
from this point of view,
it means that either

09:57.550 --> 09:59.600
the owner of the motel
or an employee

09:59.600 --> 10:00.350
that worked at the motel

10:00.350 --> 10:03.010
found a way to get a camera
and mount it up there

10:03.010 --> 10:05.680
so that anybody staying
in the room wouldnâ€™t notice it.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.970
Well, check this out.

10:06.970 --> 10:10.930
You hear that
heavy breathing?

10:10.930 --> 10:12.090
At first,
we thought this was

10:12.090 --> 10:13.890
just the creeper
exerting himself.

10:13.890 --> 10:14.430
Yeah.

10:14.430 --> 10:17.090
But according to Noelani,
that kind of breathing

10:17.090 --> 10:19.890
is indicative of
a chronic respiratory condition,

10:19.890 --> 10:21.550
most likely COPD.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.300
It would be nice
if we knew

10:23.300 --> 10:24.090
which motel this was.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.220
That way, we could
cross-reference past employees

10:26.220 --> 10:29.090
and maybe find one of them
who had COPD.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.260
Yeah, see,
thatâ€™s what we were thinking,

10:30.260 --> 10:34.510
but unfortunately, we donâ€™t have
a lot of information to go off.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.260
I mean, based off the
tropical-themed decor

10:36.260 --> 10:38.970
and the complimentary
lei, it looks like

10:38.970 --> 10:39.640
a local motel.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.090
But beyond that,
it just seems impossible

10:42.090 --> 10:44.090
to pinpoint
a specific location.

10:44.090 --> 10:46.090
Impossible?
Yeah.

10:46.930 --> 10:48.470
Young people.
Nothingâ€™s impossible.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.800
Just means you two youngâ€™uns
gonna have to get down

10:50.800 --> 10:54.090
and do some good,
old-fashioned police work.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.180
Now, this video is our best
and our only lead,

10:56.180 --> 10:59.680
so hereâ€™s what we have to do--
we have to dive deep.

10:59.680 --> 11:00.220
We have to analyze

11:00.220 --> 11:03.970
every single clue that we can
grab off here, and then we can

11:03.970 --> 11:05.640
cross-reference that
against motels

11:05.640 --> 11:06.970
that were operating
at that time.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.390
TANI:
On an island this size,
that could mean

11:09.390 --> 11:11.180
hundreds of
possible locations, easy.

11:11.180 --> 11:13.090
Then we better get started.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.510
â™ª â™ª

11:39.470 --> 11:41.720
Hey. Whereâ€™s the girl?

11:41.720 --> 11:44.720
Blonde, British,
barely legal.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.930
HARRY: Listen, mate,
we traced a request

11:46.930 --> 11:49.090
for a car from her phone
to this vehicle,

11:49.090 --> 11:50.680
so we know you picked her up.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.510
Look, I donâ€™t want any trouble.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.510
She just told me to keep driving
until I got pulled over.

11:54.510 --> 11:56.010
DANNY: Huh.
Thatâ€™s very smart.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.350
Which one of you is Harry?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.090
I am.

12:07.090 --> 12:09.220
TANI:So, the lab had a go
at cleaning up

12:09.220 --> 12:10.090
the sound on the recording.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.090
Unfortunately,
the camera was too far away.

12:12.090 --> 12:12.970
It didnâ€™t pick up much.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.220
And what it did get
was mostly inaudible,

12:15.220 --> 12:15.890
except for this.

12:15.890 --> 12:18.970
MAN :
I never promised you anything.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.970
Did he say,
"I never promised you anything"?

12:20.970 --> 12:22.010
TANI:
Yeah. Itâ€™s creepy.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.090
But it doesnâ€™t get us
any closer to getting an I.D.

12:25.090 --> 12:26.090
Okay, what else?

12:26.090 --> 12:27.680
Thereâ€™s this.

12:28.930 --> 12:30.510
You see how it gets
brighter there?

12:30.510 --> 12:32.890
Those are car headlights
sweeping across the window.

12:32.890 --> 12:35.850
Which means that the room
was on the first floor.

12:35.850 --> 12:36.430
Very good.
Yeah.

12:36.430 --> 12:39.470
Must be one of those drive-
up-to-your-door type motels.

12:39.470 --> 12:41.260
Right.
And check this out.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.680
GROVER: Oh, yeah,
those were the good old days.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.010
Back then, people used cell
phones for making calls

12:47.010 --> 12:49.680
instead of standing around
looking at damn cat videos.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.090
Yep. And we identified it
as a Motorola

12:53.090 --> 12:53.970
MicroTAC Elite.

12:53.970 --> 12:57.600
They were manufactured between
the years of â€™94 and â€™97.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.470
I was thinking we should look at

12:58.470 --> 13:00.220
missing persons cases
during that time frame.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.010
I mean, who knows?

13:01.010 --> 13:03.140
It could get us an
I.D. on the victim.

13:03.140 --> 13:04.470
What about the room key?

13:04.470 --> 13:06.140
JUNIOR:
Yeah, we looked into that, too.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.010
Looks pretty generic.

13:07.010 --> 13:09.090
It doesnâ€™t have the name
of the motel on it

13:09.090 --> 13:11.090
or any distinguishing
characteristics.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.800
Yeah, except
the room number-- 13.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.090
Well, it could explain
the victimâ€™s luck,

13:16.090 --> 13:17.550
but other than that,
itâ€™s not very helpful.

13:17.550 --> 13:20.090
GROVER:
When people build
hotels, they do so

13:20.090 --> 13:22.100
under the assumption that
most people are superstitious.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.350
Thatâ€™s why, when you go up
in a tall building,

13:24.350 --> 13:26.970
you never the see the number 13
on the elevator bank.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.090
I would assume that,
uh, itâ€™s probably rare

13:29.090 --> 13:32.350
that a motel would have
a room number 13.

13:32.350 --> 13:33.100
So we find one that does,

13:33.100 --> 13:35.760
and it could very well
be our crime scene.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.510
Boom.

13:39.090 --> 13:41.800
Well, I just broke the
news to Lady Helen.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.090
Howâ€™d she take it?
Not well.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.890
I had to promise
Iâ€™d find Sophie

13:44.890 --> 13:46.090
and get her back safely.

13:46.090 --> 13:46.640
The girl has no idea

13:46.640 --> 13:48.140
of the risk
sheâ€™s put herself in.

13:48.140 --> 13:51.680
Look, Harry, I mean, uh,
weâ€™re not going anywhere.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.090
Weâ€™re gonna make sure you get
this kid back safe, all right?

13:54.090 --> 13:56.010
HPDâ€™s got a description.
Every cop on the island

13:56.010 --> 13:58.220
is looking for her.
Weâ€™re gonna find her. Promise.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.180
I wish I found that
more comforting,

14:00.180 --> 14:01.640
but as youâ€™ve
already seen,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.260
Lady Sophie is
extremely resourceful.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.390
I spoke to some friends
back in London.

14:05.390 --> 14:06.760
Had them run a deep
surveillance dive

14:06.760 --> 14:09.050
on all of Sophieâ€™s devices
and social media accounts,

14:09.050 --> 14:10.550
and, uh, it appears
sheâ€™s wiped her phone clean

14:10.550 --> 14:13.090
and was clever enough not to
leave any clues behind as to how

14:13.090 --> 14:14.760
sheâ€™s intending on spending
her time on the island.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.760
All right, well,
this shouldnâ€™t be too difficult.

14:16.760 --> 14:17.470
Sheâ€™s 16 years old, right?

14:17.470 --> 14:19.760
So we just gotta go to
the source that knows her best.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.600
You, uh... you know
Sophieâ€™s best friend?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.260
Mmm, Harry Langford.

14:26.260 --> 14:29.800
Calling me at home
in bed after midnight.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.890
What would my father say?

14:30.890 --> 14:33.090
Heâ€™d tell you to be quiet
and listen,

14:33.090 --> 14:34.550
because this is serious,
Carlotta.

14:34.550 --> 14:37.050
Sophieâ€™s gone off
on a little adventure.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.090
Well, how did that happen,
Harry?

14:38.090 --> 14:41.090
Arenâ€™t you supposed to be
looking out for her?

14:42.090 --> 14:43.390
Where is she?

14:43.390 --> 14:44.600
How the hell should I know?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.090
DANNY: Listen,
youâ€™re supposed to be

14:46.090 --> 14:47.430
her best friend.
She probably texts you

14:47.430 --> 14:49.090
every time you go
to the bathroom.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.470
This is Detective
Danny Williams

14:50.470 --> 14:52.510
and his partner,
Steve McGarrett.

14:52.510 --> 14:53.720
Hello.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.720
Hello, Steve McGarrett.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.680
Hi.
Carlotta, please.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.090
Assuming youâ€™re right

15:00.090 --> 15:01.300
and Soph did say
something to me,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.510
why would I betray
her confidence

15:03.510 --> 15:06.090
and share that information
with you?

15:06.680 --> 15:07.300
Now, listen here,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.090
you puffed up
little trollop.

15:09.090 --> 15:09.970
Youâ€™re going
to tell us

15:09.970 --> 15:12.090
what you know, and youâ€™re
going to tell us right now.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.100
â€™Cause if you donâ€™t,
Iâ€™ll be having to have

15:14.100 --> 15:16.300
a word or two
with your father.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.800
Itâ€™s frozen. I think she got
disconnected or something.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.850
CARLOTTA:
No.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.640
Iâ€™m just trying to process

15:24.640 --> 15:26.350
that whole "trollop" bit.

15:26.350 --> 15:28.090
I think Iâ€™m done with this call.

15:28.090 --> 15:29.510
STEVE:
Oh, Carlotta.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.760
Hi. Itâ€™s me.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.140
Steve.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.760
I know this seems
like a fun joke.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.550
She slipped her bodyguard.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.090
Sheâ€™s out there
exploring the island,

15:36.090 --> 15:38.140
having a fun time,
but the bottom line is--

15:38.140 --> 15:41.930
if word gets out that
a British royal is on the loose,

15:41.930 --> 15:44.390
Sophie could find herself
in a bunch of trouble.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.090
You guys are such killjoys.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.890
Sheâ€™s met a boy there.

15:48.890 --> 15:51.090
When

15:51.090 --> 15:52.090
On a dating app.

15:52.090 --> 15:53.090
STEVE:
Okay. All right.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.090
You got a name for this kid?

15:54.090 --> 15:58.010
No, but Soph texted me
a photo of him the other day.

15:58.010 --> 15:59.680
Heâ€™s actually quite cute.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.430
Oh. Well, thatâ€™s good.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.430
Uh, could you send us
the photo, please?

16:02.430 --> 16:04.090
Uh, for investigative
purposes,

16:04.090 --> 16:07.090
not because heâ€™s cute...
allegedly.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.180
Yeah. All right, fine.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.930
Hi. Iâ€™m calling
because I think my parents

16:11.930 --> 16:13.640
may have honeymooned
at your motel.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.930
It was back in the â€™90s.
â€™95 if I have my dates right.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.050
Yeah, anyway,
itâ€™s their anniversary,

16:18.050 --> 16:19.800
and Iâ€™d love to book them
in the same room

16:19.800 --> 16:20.680
that they stayed
in back then.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.260
I do know that they stayed
in room number 13.

16:22.260 --> 16:26.390
Could that have been your motel?
So you donâ€™t have a room 13?

16:26.390 --> 16:27.680
No room 13, huh?

16:27.680 --> 16:30.090
You did

16:31.720 --> 16:35.470
Okay, so the managerâ€™s saying
that this place-- the Avalon--

16:35.470 --> 16:37.800
they renumbered their rooms
a while ago,

16:37.800 --> 16:40.430
but they did at one point
have a room 13.

16:40.430 --> 16:41.800
It also looks like
they remodeled

16:41.800 --> 16:43.930
at some point
in the last ten years.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.090
Let me have a look at that.

16:49.090 --> 16:51.220
JUNIOR:
Check it out.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.760
TANI:
Holy crap.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.430
Thatâ€™s our motel.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.720
You sure this is it?

17:02.720 --> 17:06.100
Room 13.
At least it used to be.

17:06.100 --> 17:06.760
Okay, so...

17:06.760 --> 17:09.760
Decorâ€™s a little bit different,
but the basic layoutâ€™s the same.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.890
I think this could be it.

17:13.390 --> 17:15.220
Say, was there ever an opening
in this ceiling?

17:15.220 --> 17:16.510
Like, for an AC vent
or something?

17:16.510 --> 17:18.890
The rooms were remodeled
before I started working here,

17:18.890 --> 17:20.930
but as far as I know,
theyâ€™ve always

17:20.930 --> 17:23.140
used wall units
for the air-conditioning.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.010
Huh.

17:25.010 --> 17:25.760
Okay.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.930
We need to get up
into this attic.

17:27.930 --> 17:31.090
And by "we," I mean you two.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.640
â™ª â™ª

17:41.890 --> 17:44.050
JUNIOR:
Watch your step.

17:45.180 --> 17:46.890
Hey. Check this out.

17:46.890 --> 17:50.760
Looks like someone spent
quite a bit of time up here.

17:57.550 --> 17:59.720
TANI:
Look at this.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.090
Looks like
an old AC vent.

18:05.090 --> 18:07.180
Yeah, but itâ€™s
not connected.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.930
Give me your knife.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.090
Hi there.

18:36.090 --> 18:36.600
Hi.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.390
Looks like we found
our crime scene.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.890
You know what the weird thing
about all this is?

18:48.890 --> 18:51.890
I think I have a good idea,
but, uh, go ahead.

18:51.890 --> 18:54.270
Well, if it wasnâ€™t
for creepy, heavy-breathing guy

18:54.270 --> 18:55.480
and his weird,
perverted obsession,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.770
we wouldnâ€™t know anything
about this murder.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.890
Iâ€™m not
defending him.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.600
I knew you were gonna...
Well, it kind of
sounds like you are.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.890
No, Iâ€™m not defending him.
Yeah.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.690
Iâ€™m just saying
it was useful to us.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.020
Okay.
From our point of view.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.980
Obviously,
Iâ€™m appalled by somebody

19:07.980 --> 19:09.520
videotaping people
having sex.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.100
Uh-huh.
I mean, without
their consent, obviously.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.770
So, I just spoke
with the owner.

19:13.770 --> 19:16.020
He bought the place
ten years ago.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.440
Okay, so heâ€™s not our guy.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.900
Right, but the man
he bought it from

19:18.900 --> 19:21.060
had owned this place
since the â€™70s.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.230
So, then, thatâ€™s the guy
we need to talk to.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.980
GROVER:
Thatâ€™s gonna be
a little problem.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.890
He died three years ago.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.020
Come on.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.890
HARRY:
I canâ€™t believe Sophie

19:33.890 --> 19:35.350
ran off with this pond weed.

19:35.350 --> 19:37.190
What could she
possibly see in him?

19:37.190 --> 19:37.890
Oh, come on, man.

19:37.890 --> 19:39.810
Her fatherâ€™s an
actual lord, right?

19:39.810 --> 19:41.890
This guyâ€™s a...
pond weed.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.730
Sheâ€™s rebelling.
Makes total sense.

19:43.730 --> 19:47.890
All right, good news is he
does not have a criminal record.

19:47.890 --> 19:48.230
Oh.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.020
Doesnâ€™t have a driverâ€™s
license, either.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.350
So thereâ€™s no way
we can identify him.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.480
You guys, get
out... move away.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.100
I gotta do everything?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.890
Look. He may not have a license
or a record, but...

19:57.890 --> 20:00.650
if he is under the age of 30,
he definitely has

20:00.650 --> 20:01.350
a social media footprint.

20:01.350 --> 20:03.270
HARRY:
Well, if he isnâ€™t
behaving himself,

20:03.270 --> 20:06.980
Iâ€™m going to leave a pretty
heavy footprint on his face.

20:06.980 --> 20:09.440
Look at you,
all tech savvy.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.890
DANNY: I got
a 16-year-old daughter.

20:10.890 --> 20:13.600
Nothing I wouldnâ€™t do
to spy on her.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.060
STEVE:
Travis Lynch.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.890
Complete and utter Muppet.

20:19.890 --> 20:21.150
Thatâ€™s a new one.

20:21.150 --> 20:22.310
Hey, uh, Danny,

20:22.310 --> 20:24.890
bring up his
timeline thing.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.190
STEVE:
There we go.

20:27.190 --> 20:30.230
Oh, look at that.

20:30.810 --> 20:32.650
These photographs
were uploaded

20:32.650 --> 20:36.890
less than an hour ago
from the Muse Beach Club.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.810
HARRY:
There.

20:39.810 --> 20:41.440
Thatâ€™s Sophie.

20:42.890 --> 20:44.690
Says, uh...

20:44.690 --> 20:47.350
"Scored a real-life princess.

20:47.350 --> 20:48.890
Hashtag, life goals."

20:48.890 --> 20:51.350
Firstly, sheâ€™s a lady,
not a princess.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.730
And secondly...

20:53.890 --> 20:56.230
Actually, I donâ€™t have
anything to add to that.

20:56.230 --> 20:57.810
I just want to kill him.

20:57.810 --> 20:59.310
Hey, Harry.

20:59.310 --> 21:02.150
This picture
has over 300 likes.

21:02.150 --> 21:04.890
Which means weâ€™re not
the only ones who know

21:04.890 --> 21:06.100
Lady Sophieâ€™s at this party.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.890
We better pick
her up quickly

21:07.890 --> 21:10.940
before the wrong kind of people
realize she doesnâ€™t have

21:10.940 --> 21:12.440
any security with her.

21:14.020 --> 21:17.890
â™ª Go out of your mind,
get crazy like psycho â™ª

21:17.890 --> 21:20.100
â™ª â™ª

21:25.400 --> 21:29.060
â™ª Crazy like, crazy like,
crazy like psycho â™ª

21:34.440 --> 21:37.350
â™ª Somebody say hey â™ª

21:37.350 --> 21:39.400
â™ª We wanna party â™ª

21:39.400 --> 21:41.890
â™ª Hey, we wanna party... â™ª

21:41.890 --> 21:42.560
I know this song.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.890
Itâ€™s the one that gives me
a bad headache.

21:44.890 --> 21:48.270
Hey, uh, Harry, I think
we should split up,

21:48.270 --> 21:49.890
cover more ground, huh?

21:49.890 --> 21:51.060
Uh-huh.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.890
â™ª Go out of your mind,
get crazy like psycho â™ª

21:58.890 --> 22:01.890
â™ª â™ª

22:03.600 --> 22:06.850
Yo, pops,
this is a private party.

22:10.230 --> 22:14.060
â™ª Crazy like, crazy like,
crazy like psycho â™ª

22:14.060 --> 22:16.440
â™ª â™ª

22:22.890 --> 22:24.900
Youâ€™re not Lady Sophie.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.150
Dude, are you serious
right now?

22:27.150 --> 22:29.690
Where is she?
Whereâ€™s who?

22:29.690 --> 22:30.690
STEVE:
Hi, Harry.

22:30.690 --> 22:31.770
Hi.
I guess, uh...

22:31.770 --> 22:32.690
I guess you found Travis.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.940
Yo, I bought a bottle
to reserve this cabana.

22:34.940 --> 22:36.730
You canâ€™t be here right now.
Why donâ€™t you

22:36.730 --> 22:38.980
get on your feet
and kick me out of here?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.230
DANNY:
Everybody calm down.

22:40.230 --> 22:41.940
Letâ€™s, uh... letâ€™s move
back from the party.

22:41.940 --> 22:44.890
You... you can stay there.
Everybody, letâ€™s-letâ€™s, uh...

22:44.890 --> 22:45.980
letâ€™s clear this area.

22:45.980 --> 22:48.650
This is crazy.
I didnâ€™t do anything.

22:48.650 --> 22:49.310
You want to talk?

22:49.310 --> 22:51.020
You can call my dadâ€™s lawyer.

22:51.020 --> 22:51.730
He can...

22:51.730 --> 22:54.150
Ow!
Kind of had that coming.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.890
That, like, really hurt.

22:56.890 --> 22:57.520
Good.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.270
Now that I have
your attention,

22:59.270 --> 23:02.600
letâ€™s start with where
Lady Sophie Mortimer is.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.850
Looks a little
like the girl

23:03.850 --> 23:06.230
that you were playing
tonsil tennis with.

23:06.230 --> 23:07.690
Yea-high, blonde,
very smart.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.810
English,
way out of your league.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.230
I donâ€™t have any idea, dude.

23:11.230 --> 23:13.310
Well, thatâ€™s not
the right answer, is it, matey?

23:13.310 --> 23:16.850
Which means Iâ€™m gonna have
to break one of your arms now.

23:16.850 --> 23:18.350
But Iâ€™ll be a
gentleman about it

23:18.350 --> 23:19.310
and let you
choose which one.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.850
You-you guys canâ€™t do this.
You guys are cops.

23:21.850 --> 23:22.890
No, actually,
weâ€™re cops.

23:22.890 --> 23:25.060
Heâ€™s, uh...
he does his own thing.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.230
STEVE:
Yeah, and while you do

23:26.230 --> 23:28.890
your own thing,
weâ€™re gonna look this way, okay?

23:28.890 --> 23:30.890
O-O-Okay, okay!

23:30.890 --> 23:31.890
Iâ€™ll talk.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.400
Excellent decision.

23:36.770 --> 23:37.890
I met her on a dating app.

23:37.890 --> 23:39.350
I was just minding
my own business,

23:39.350 --> 23:41.350
swiping left,
and then boom, we match.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.890
I mean, sheâ€™s hot,
sheâ€™s got good chat.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.900
She has an amazing body.

23:47.650 --> 23:48.940
Did I say body?

23:48.940 --> 23:50.230
I meant personality.

23:50.230 --> 23:51.230
DANNY:
That was good.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.690
Good save.
TRAVIS: Anyway,

23:52.690 --> 23:54.060
we message back and forth,
and she tells me

23:54.060 --> 23:56.100
sheâ€™s gonna be on the island
for a couple days.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.480
She wants someone
to show her a good time.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.150
So I tell her

23:59.150 --> 24:00.980
I can get her into
this sick party,

24:00.980 --> 24:02.520
and she said she was down.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.600
So you arranged
to meet, huh?

24:04.600 --> 24:04.900
Right.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.480
She has me pick her up
outside this store on Kalakaua.

24:08.480 --> 24:13.400
I had no idea this chick
was, like, royalty or whatever.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.890
As far as I know
from her profile,

24:14.890 --> 24:16.150
sheâ€™s Katie from London.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.600
And then I find out
sheâ€™s some kind of princess

24:18.600 --> 24:20.270
when people
start recognizing her.

24:20.270 --> 24:22.940
But she didnâ€™t exactly
play it on the down-low.

24:22.940 --> 24:23.890
What does that mean?

24:23.890 --> 24:27.690
I mean that chick
really knows how to party.

24:27.690 --> 24:29.560
â™ª Ah, Iâ€™m walkinâ€™ in the club â™ª

24:29.560 --> 24:31.850
â™ª All eyes on me,
shake it, shake it up â™ª

24:31.850 --> 24:33.480
â™ª Itâ€™s a celebration
every time we link up â™ª

24:33.480 --> 24:35.770
â™ª Yeah, move on the dance floor,
on the dance floor â™ª

24:35.770 --> 24:38.980
â™ª Move on the dance floor,
on the dance floor â™ª

24:38.980 --> 24:40.560
â™ª Move on the dance floor â™ª

24:40.560 --> 24:41.980
â™ª On the dance floor â™ª

24:41.980 --> 24:43.890
â™ª â™ª

24:45.890 --> 24:48.770
â™ª On the dance floor,
on the dance floor â™ª

24:49.980 --> 24:51.810
â™ª Boom, boom, boom,
boom, b-boom... â™ª

24:51.810 --> 24:52.890
A little while later, I decided

24:52.890 --> 24:53.890
I should go get her a drink.

24:53.890 --> 24:55.890
It was a Shirley Temple,
before you ask.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.100
But when I get back,
sheâ€™s sitting

24:57.100 --> 24:58.100
on some other dudeâ€™s lap.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.020
I felt kind of used.

25:03.020 --> 25:06.440
But I was, like, whatever.
This chick is bananas.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.600
Iâ€™m sorry, but she is.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.940
STEVE:
Okay. So, was that

25:10.940 --> 25:13.060
the last time
you saw her?

25:13.060 --> 25:14.600
No. Um...

25:14.600 --> 25:16.730
a little while later,
I saw her split

25:16.730 --> 25:17.310
with these two chicks.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.310
And no, I donâ€™t know
who they are.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.890
Well, whatâ€™d they look like?

25:22.600 --> 25:23.890
They were blonde.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.430
DANNY:So weâ€™re looking
for three blonde girls.

25:26.530 --> 25:27.490
This is a good lead.

25:27.490 --> 25:31.860
Yeah, with this head start,
she could be anywhere by now.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.690
Hold on a minute.

25:33.690 --> 25:34.900
Excuse me, old chap.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.690
Couldnâ€™t help noticing you
all alone here.

25:37.690 --> 25:39.150
Yeah, Iâ€™m married.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.450
To a woman.

25:40.450 --> 25:41.110
Lovely as you are,

25:41.110 --> 25:42.400
Iâ€™m more interested
in your camera here.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.400
Youâ€™re a photographer, right?
Freelance, Iâ€™m guessing.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.690
Yeah, uh, what tipped you off?

25:47.690 --> 25:48.240
Youâ€™ve got that

25:48.240 --> 25:50.150
"buzzard hanging around
a water hole" look about you.

25:50.150 --> 25:52.690
Plus, I recognize you
from the crowd of paparazzi

25:52.690 --> 25:53.900
outside the Hilton
this morning.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.240
Is that a celebratory whiskey?

25:55.240 --> 25:56.690
Did you get your shot?

25:56.690 --> 25:57.070
I did.

25:57.070 --> 25:59.820
Not that itâ€™s any
of your business.

25:59.820 --> 26:00.490
Actually, it is.

26:00.490 --> 26:03.950
Weâ€™re gonna need to take
a look at that camera, okay?

26:06.320 --> 26:07.690
HARRY:
Ah.

26:07.690 --> 26:08.320
Here we are.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.530
PHOTOGRAPHER: As soon as
the bureau desk opens,

26:11.530 --> 26:12.320
those pictures go in.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.990
Spoiled little princess
partying with men twice her age.

26:15.990 --> 26:19.950
The tabloids
go crazy for this stuff.

26:21.690 --> 26:23.690
Your family must be
very proud of you.

26:23.690 --> 26:26.610
Look, you might not
like what I do,

26:26.610 --> 26:27.400
but I gotta make a living.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.490
Those pictures are worth
a lot of money to me.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.070
What pictures?

26:33.070 --> 26:35.110
Whatâ€™d you do?

26:35.110 --> 26:37.110
You deleted them.

26:37.110 --> 26:39.450
Iâ€™m gonna sue you!

26:39.450 --> 26:41.690
You hear me?

26:44.450 --> 26:46.690
Hey, listen, I just
heard back from Noelani.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.950
She pulled the medical records
of the man who owned the motel

26:49.950 --> 26:51.240
back when the tape was made.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.530
No evidence
of a pulmonary condition.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.610
All right,
so we rule him out, then.

26:55.610 --> 26:57.570
Juniorâ€™s trying to dig up
some employee records.

26:57.570 --> 27:00.650
Maybe one of them
might be our Peeping Tom.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.400
Okay. Um, in other news,

27:02.400 --> 27:04.490
I may have just
I.D.â€™d our victim.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.610
Oh. All right, Iâ€™m listening.

27:05.610 --> 27:07.690
So, I was looking at open
missing persons cases

27:07.690 --> 27:10.950
from â€™94 to â€™97,
and I cross-referenced them

27:10.950 --> 27:13.570
with images that I took
from the video.

27:13.570 --> 27:14.900
Look what I found.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.610
Hmm?

27:19.690 --> 27:21.280
GROVER:
Lara Levy.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.650
Mm-hmm.

27:22.650 --> 27:24.860
I looked at her HPD file.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.690
Her roommate at the time
told the police

27:27.690 --> 27:29.740
that she was in
this secretive relationship

27:29.740 --> 27:30.950
with this guy from out of town.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.690
So, then, he becomes
the main avenue of inquiry.

27:33.690 --> 27:35.690
But HPD never finds him,

27:35.690 --> 27:36.530
so her...

27:36.530 --> 27:40.690
her missing persons case
goes unsolved.

27:42.030 --> 27:44.570
You got something on your mind?

27:44.860 --> 27:48.690
Yeah. Just...
I just think itâ€™s sad.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.280
Iâ€™m sitting here
20 years later,

27:50.280 --> 27:53.070
Iâ€™m going through
her case file...

27:53.280 --> 27:54.700
Iâ€™m trying to find
something about this girl

27:54.700 --> 27:57.200
thatâ€™s gonna tell us something
about who her killer is.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.690
And Iâ€™m doing that
because there was

27:58.690 --> 28:01.690
no one at the time
that cared enough about her

28:01.690 --> 28:02.740
to find out.

28:02.740 --> 28:03.610
There was nobody

28:03.610 --> 28:06.650
fighting for justice
on her behalf.

28:06.690 --> 28:11.070
You know, she wasnâ€™t married,
she was an orphan.

28:11.070 --> 28:13.400
She had nobody.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.200
So she was just forgotten.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.820
Tani...

28:26.240 --> 28:28.320
This is the tough
part of the job--

28:28.320 --> 28:29.700
these type cases.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.490
They donâ€™t always end

28:31.490 --> 28:32.860
with us knocking
on somebodyâ€™s door

28:32.860 --> 28:34.860
and giving them the news
that theyâ€™ve been

28:34.860 --> 28:37.860
waiting years to hear
and give them closure.

28:39.320 --> 28:42.070
Sometimes there is no closure.

28:42.070 --> 28:43.650
No closure, no healing.

28:43.650 --> 28:46.070
Not in the here
and now, at least.

28:46.070 --> 28:51.610
Sometimes itâ€™s just about us
getting justice for the victim,

28:51.610 --> 28:53.950
and thatâ€™s all.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.690
And thatâ€™s enough.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.650
Hey, I got something
yâ€™all are gonna want to see.

29:02.650 --> 29:04.690
So I just heard back
from the lab.

29:04.690 --> 29:06.690
They got some DNA
off an old soda can

29:06.690 --> 29:08.240
that we found in the attic.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.490
They ran it and got a hit.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.780
JUNIOR:
Arthur Dubbins.

29:12.780 --> 29:13.740
Heâ€™s in our system
for theft

29:13.740 --> 29:15.690
and aggravated assault,
and guess where he used to work.

29:15.690 --> 29:18.990
The Avalon.
Mm-hmm. He was the handyman
there for about 15 years.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.690
GROVER: Okay. We got
a current address on him?

29:21.690 --> 29:23.150
JUNIOR:
I do, but weâ€™re not

29:23.150 --> 29:24.030
gonna find him there.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.690
Why not?
Arthur Dubbins collapsed

29:25.690 --> 29:28.400
about three weeks ago
from a stroke.

29:28.690 --> 29:29.690
He was admitted to the hospital

29:29.690 --> 29:32.240
and has been
in a coma ever since.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.090
GROVER: Mrs. Dubbins, I have
here the admitting forms

29:41.090 --> 29:43.090
from when your husband
checked into the hospital.

29:43.090 --> 29:47.000
Can you please verify for us
that this is your signature?

29:48.660 --> 29:50.490
It is.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.490
The handwriting analysis
determined

29:52.490 --> 29:53.790
that these two samples

29:53.790 --> 29:55.410
were a 98% match.

29:55.410 --> 29:57.490
You sent that to us.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.200
You wanted us
to find out who did this.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.120
GROVER:
I canâ€™t imagine
how difficult

30:01.120 --> 30:02.490
this must have
been for you

30:02.490 --> 30:04.950
to keep that secret
all these years.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.490
Iâ€™m sure you wanted
to go to the police

30:07.490 --> 30:09.490
and tell them what you
knew the whole time.

30:09.490 --> 30:13.330
Only your husband
wouldnâ€™t hear of it, am I right?

30:13.490 --> 30:15.290
TANI:
Then he had a stroke.

30:15.290 --> 30:17.490
He went into a coma,
and you thought,

30:17.490 --> 30:20.200
"This is my chance to finally
do the right thing."

30:20.200 --> 30:23.450
But what if somehow he woke up?

30:23.450 --> 30:25.660
Found out what you did?

30:25.660 --> 30:27.290
What then?

30:27.290 --> 30:30.580
Mrs. Dubbins...

30:30.580 --> 30:33.290
I can promise
you one thing.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.000
Regardless of what
happens to your husband,

30:36.000 --> 30:37.160
we can protect you.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.330
We will protect you.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.290
You have my word on that.

30:40.490 --> 30:46.580
But, maâ€™am, weâ€™re going to
need your help on this case.

30:49.750 --> 30:53.040
It was so long ago now.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.330
Arthur...

30:58.330 --> 31:01.250
hadnâ€™t been sleeping.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.620
He was drinking more.

31:04.790 --> 31:09.200
I could tell there was
something eating at him.

31:09.580 --> 31:12.700
When I confronted him...

31:13.250 --> 31:17.250
...he finally told me
what heâ€™d seen.

31:17.490 --> 31:19.000
Did your husband
know the identity

31:19.000 --> 31:21.490
of the man who
committed the murder?

31:22.200 --> 31:24.450
I think he did.

31:24.830 --> 31:25.910
Why do you say that?

31:25.910 --> 31:29.660
Because he had access
to the guest logs.

31:29.660 --> 31:34.450
And the one time
I asked him about it...

31:35.660 --> 31:37.410
...he hit me.

31:37.410 --> 31:42.490
Said, if I were ever
to tell anyone what heâ€™d seen

31:42.490 --> 31:46.490
or if I went to the police,
he...

31:46.490 --> 31:48.950
heâ€™d kill me.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.250
Thereâ€™s something else.

32:00.490 --> 32:05.330
Something I think
you should see.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.580
â™ª You gonna know my name â™ª

32:24.950 --> 32:27.660
â™ª I ainâ€™t playing no games â™ª

32:27.660 --> 32:31.040
â™ª Donâ€™t try to tell me
what to do... â™ª

32:31.040 --> 32:32.000
Whereâ€™s this party, then?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.200
Over there, on our
friend Oliverâ€™s boat.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.410
Weâ€™re super early,
but donâ€™t worry--

32:36.410 --> 32:37.540
itâ€™ll pick up soon.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.490
â™ª Watch me, watch me â™ª

32:39.490 --> 32:43.290
â™ª One, two,
one, two, three, four... â™ª

32:43.950 --> 32:46.490
â™ª â™ª

32:46.490 --> 32:47.490
Come on.

32:47.490 --> 32:49.540
Itâ€™ll be totally lit.

32:49.540 --> 32:51.620
I promise.

32:52.490 --> 32:54.490
All right, so the plate
on the BMW

32:54.490 --> 32:55.660
came back as a rental.

32:55.660 --> 32:56.500
Itâ€™s currently on loan

32:56.500 --> 32:58.950
to a James Hollis
of Detroit, Michigan.

32:58.950 --> 33:00.040
Did we run background
on this guy?

33:00.040 --> 33:02.870
Yeah, I did, and I got
absolutely nothing.

33:02.870 --> 33:03.490
You know why?

33:03.490 --> 33:05.080
There is no James Hollis.
Itâ€™s a fake name.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.500
Whoever rented this car didnâ€™t
want it traced back to them.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.580
Iâ€™m getting a very bad feeling
about this.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.950
Well, there is some good news.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.370
Well, letâ€™s have that, then.

33:13.370 --> 33:14.330
Apparently, the Beemer

33:14.330 --> 33:15.910
has a vehicle recovery system.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.750
Rental companyâ€™s
checking into that right now.

33:17.750 --> 33:20.080
Soon as I hear from them,
youâ€™re my first call.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.830
STEVE: All right, thanks, Lou.
All right.

33:28.870 --> 33:31.450
Howâ€™s it going, kids?

33:31.450 --> 33:33.000
You know when
youâ€™re watching a video

33:33.000 --> 33:36.450
with your family
and a sex scene comes on?

33:36.450 --> 33:37.290
No.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.290
Okay, well,
this whole thingâ€™s

33:38.290 --> 33:39.500
kind of been like that,
hasnâ€™t it, Junes?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.200
JUNIOR:
Yeah, Iâ€™ve seen a lot

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
of stuff I wish I could unsee.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.490
TANI:
But, um,

33:44.490 --> 33:45.490
within all the kink,

33:45.490 --> 33:47.490
we did find
nine recordings

33:47.490 --> 33:48.250
of Lara with the same guy.

33:48.250 --> 33:51.490
JUNIOR: And the dates match
with those her roommate provided

33:51.490 --> 33:53.290
in an old HPD
missing person report.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.160
So this has to be the guy
that Lara was seeing.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.200
GROVER: All right,
how you doing on I.D.â€™ing him?

33:57.200 --> 33:59.490
These are the best screen grabs
that we could get.

33:59.490 --> 34:02.620
As you can see, the camera angle
is really working against us.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.490
Itâ€™s basically impossible
to get a visual

34:04.490 --> 34:06.580
thatâ€™s gonna help us
identify him.

34:06.580 --> 34:07.750
Okay, what about audio?

34:07.750 --> 34:08.490
I mean, the two of these

34:08.490 --> 34:10.580
must have had some conversations
that ended up getting recorded.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.490
Iâ€™m sure they did,
but Dubbins only recorded

34:12.490 --> 34:15.250
the bits when they were
getting down to, you know...

34:15.250 --> 34:16.490
Yeah, yeah.
TANI: Yeah, we did find

34:16.490 --> 34:20.490
two times, though, where Lara
refers to him as Paul.

34:20.490 --> 34:22.580
Okay, so hereâ€™s
what we know.

34:22.580 --> 34:23.790
The killerâ€™s
name is Paul.

34:23.790 --> 34:25.490
He was between the
ages of 30 and 40.

34:25.490 --> 34:28.620
And according to Laraâ€™s
old roommateâ€™s statement

34:28.620 --> 34:31.450
when Lara first
went missing,

34:31.450 --> 34:33.910
she would see this
man at this motel

34:33.910 --> 34:37.490
every Thursday
for a few months.

34:37.490 --> 34:41.490
Thatâ€™s not a lot to
go on. We know...

34:42.120 --> 34:43.750
GROVER:
Hang on.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.660
Thereâ€™s a pin
on that jacket.

34:45.660 --> 34:47.700
Zoom in on that pin.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.200
GROVER:
There it is.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.830
He was here
every Thursday

34:51.830 --> 34:53.540
because he was
on a layover,

34:53.540 --> 34:55.830
because heâ€™s an
airline pilot.

34:55.830 --> 34:57.580
Okay, so if we can
figure out which airline

34:57.580 --> 35:00.580
that pin is associated
with, we can I.D. him.

35:00.580 --> 35:01.580
Well done.

35:01.580 --> 35:03.950
TANI:
Later, Uncle Lou.

35:05.410 --> 35:06.700
Oh, not for me,
but thank you.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.120
Suit yourself.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.490
So much for that party,
I guess.

35:10.910 --> 35:12.580
Well, itâ€™s been lovely,

35:12.580 --> 35:15.410
but I think this is
where I bow out.

35:15.410 --> 35:16.620
Go sit down.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.490
Iâ€™d really much rather not.

35:19.490 --> 35:20.080
If I was you,

35:20.080 --> 35:22.490
Iâ€™d keep my mouth shut
and do as I was told.

35:22.490 --> 35:25.490
â€™Cause if you want any chance
of getting off this boat al...

35:28.410 --> 35:30.250
Perhaps I can save you all
a lot of bother.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.040
Youâ€™re clearly massively
out of your depth.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.250
I mean, what was the plan?

35:34.250 --> 35:35.490
To kidnap me?

35:35.490 --> 35:36.330
Demand a ransom?

35:36.330 --> 35:38.200
Look, I hate to disappoint,
but there are people

35:38.200 --> 35:39.120
who already know Iâ€™m missing,

35:39.120 --> 35:40.450
and they are not
the sort of people

35:40.450 --> 35:41.620
you want coming after you.
Trust me.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.950
Best option all around
would be to...

35:42.950 --> 35:46.330
to let me off this boat, and
weâ€™ll let bygones be bygones.

35:46.330 --> 35:48.490
I have a terrible memory
for faces anyway.

35:48.490 --> 35:51.910
Iâ€™m just gonna put this all down
to a silly misunderstanding.

35:51.910 --> 35:54.330
No hard feelings, okay?

35:54.330 --> 35:56.250
Great speech.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.700
But weâ€™re not gonna ransom you.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.660
Weâ€™re gonna sell you
to the highest bidder.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.580
A bona fide princess
like yourself

36:04.580 --> 36:07.540
should fetch top dollar.

36:16.490 --> 36:18.870
â™ª â™ª

36:29.490 --> 36:30.790
Itâ€™s locked.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.450
Allow me.

36:34.450 --> 36:36.490
I couldâ€™ve done that.

36:41.790 --> 36:43.490
SSMartha.

36:43.490 --> 36:45.950
Clever girl.

36:50.490 --> 36:53.330
Got a nice, rich
prince for you.

36:53.330 --> 36:55.120
Youâ€™ll make a
lovely couple.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.410
Well, you wonâ€™t
technically be a couple.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.500
More like youâ€™ll be joining
his roster of girlfriends.

37:00.490 --> 37:02.370
Some might call it a harem.

37:04.660 --> 37:05.490
Come on, now.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.660
Stop crying.
Youâ€™ll ruin the photo.

37:07.660 --> 37:10.620
We want the prince
to like what he sees.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.290
Donâ€™t we?

37:18.910 --> 37:23.250
The prince might notice
a black eye, but...

37:23.540 --> 37:28.080
...maybe he wonâ€™t care about
a few bruises on your body.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.500
HARRY:
Good afternoon, everyone.

37:34.660 --> 37:35.870
Who are you?

37:35.870 --> 37:38.490
Where the hell
did you come from?

37:40.370 --> 37:41.160
HARRY:To be honest,

37:41.160 --> 37:42.830
itâ€™s a long story,
and itâ€™s probably

37:42.830 --> 37:44.490
not worth getting into
right now.

37:44.490 --> 37:45.540
Sophie, you all right?

37:45.540 --> 37:46.790
OLIVER:
What...

37:46.790 --> 37:48.790
youâ€™re her dad?

37:48.790 --> 37:49.660
Come to pick her up?

37:49.660 --> 37:53.870
Iâ€™m just here to make sure
she, uh, gets home safely.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.200
What about you?

37:56.200 --> 37:58.330
Whoâ€™s here to make sure
you get home safe?

37:58.330 --> 38:00.370
Oh, he should be along
any minute.

38:00.370 --> 38:02.790
To help me beat
you imbeciles to death.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.490
STEVE:
Whatâ€™d I miss?

38:08.490 --> 38:09.750
Hey, Soph.

38:09.750 --> 38:10.490
How about I just shoot you two

38:10.490 --> 38:12.200
in the head and dump
your bodies overboard?
Whoa, whoa.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.490
Okay, all right. Take it easy.
Hold on for a second.

38:14.490 --> 38:15.830
Heâ€™s got a point. I mean...

38:15.830 --> 38:18.490
Strange choice
of hand cannon.

38:18.490 --> 38:20.080
Beretta M9,

38:20.080 --> 38:20.580
double action.

38:20.580 --> 38:21.830
Itâ€™s got a 13-pound
trigger pull.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.200
Heâ€™s right. By the time you
actually squeeze a round off,

38:24.200 --> 38:25.490
Iâ€™m gonna have that thing
in your mouth.

38:25.490 --> 38:28.910
Why donâ€™t you two
just shut up and die?

38:44.410 --> 38:45.790
SOPHIE:
Well, um...

38:45.790 --> 38:47.660
I had a good run, but...

38:47.660 --> 38:50.620
I think itâ€™s time
I go home now.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.490
Mm-hmm.

39:01.490 --> 39:02.000
Mrs. Hoff?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.490
Iâ€™m Captain Lou Grover with
the Hawaii Five-O Task Force.

39:05.490 --> 39:08.490
Whatâ€™s this all about?

39:08.490 --> 39:11.200
Lara Levy.

39:15.490 --> 39:17.750
â™ª â™ª

39:44.160 --> 39:45.870
Sarge.

39:45.870 --> 39:47.700
I got something.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.080
Oh, youâ€™re safe.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.290
Thank God.

40:13.290 --> 40:14.450
Well, technically thank Harry.

40:14.450 --> 40:16.410
And Steve and Danny as well.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.200
Hello, darling.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.120
I came as soon as I heard.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.870
Daddy.

40:33.490 --> 40:34.000
Hey.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.080
You, uh, want to grab
a beer or something?

40:46.750 --> 40:49.580
So, uh, is, uh, she hip?
Does she know?

40:49.580 --> 40:51.490
Does who know what?

40:51.490 --> 40:52.910
Does she know

40:52.910 --> 40:56.490
that you are her real father?

40:57.370 --> 41:01.330
I mean, the way she had us
running around the island.

41:01.330 --> 41:02.370
Sheâ€™s very elusive,
you know.

41:02.370 --> 41:04.870
Itâ€™s, uh... itâ€™s like you
guys are very similar.

41:04.870 --> 41:07.040
And that look you
had on your face,

41:07.040 --> 41:09.040
uh, when you thought
she was in danger.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.580
That is... that is the
look of a scared father.

41:11.580 --> 41:12.450
I know that look.

41:12.450 --> 41:14.950
And not to mention when,
uh, Lord Whatâ€™s-His-Name,

41:14.950 --> 41:16.790
he showed up and she
ran into his arms,

41:16.790 --> 41:18.490
gave him a big hug,
you looked like

41:18.490 --> 41:20.790
you were about to
throw up, so...

41:25.490 --> 41:28.040
Lady Helen was
separated at the time.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.370
And, um, when she told me
she was pregnant,

41:31.370 --> 41:34.120
I very much wanted
to do the right thing.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.910
Which, in the end,
meant accepting

41:36.910 --> 41:41.080
her decision to go back
to her husband.

41:41.490 --> 41:43.330
STEVE:
Harry, can I ask you

41:43.330 --> 41:44.490
a question?

41:44.490 --> 41:44.830
Hmm?

41:44.830 --> 41:47.490
You think the kid
has a right to know

41:47.490 --> 41:50.000
who her real father is?

41:50.490 --> 41:53.950
If she ever asks,
I wonâ€™t lie.

41:54.450 --> 41:58.200
In the meantime,
Iâ€™ll always be there for her.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.490
Fair enough.
