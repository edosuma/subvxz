Darrowby 2297. Hello, Mrs
Pumphrey's butler here.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.560
Yes, Francois, Flop Bot again?

01:04.560 --> 01:07.280
Non, Tricki's struggling to breathe.
That does sound bad.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.480
Mrs Pumphrey would like you to come.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.960
All right, I'll be there as soon as
I can. Merci. Thank you.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.320
Maggie! Maggie, come on wake up.
Come on. It's seven o'clock.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.600
Oh, bugger!

01:22.720 --> 01:25.160
Come on. I'll see you later.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.120
If you're in the pub. See you later.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.320
DOOR BELL RINGS, DOG BARKS

01:28.320 --> 01:30.600
Quiet down Jess!

01:30.600 --> 01:33.120
In here. Wait, Tristan!
BARKING CONTINUES

01:40.200 --> 01:43.040
Morning. Oh. Thank you, John.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.160
THUDDING FOOTSTEPS

02:02.160 --> 02:03.960
Good morning, Mrs Hall.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.520
You were wearing that yesterday.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.920
Just...trying to ease the laundry

02:10.920 --> 02:13.120
burden before I leave
for college next week.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.040
Morning. Just the man.
For what exactly?

02:16.040 --> 02:17.800
It's only a week before I go

02:17.800 --> 02:20.360
and there's that small
matter of my cheque.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.160
Cheque. What cheque? For food.
Lodgings.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.840
Oh, don't worry about that.
You're family. Happy to help. No.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.160
So I can go back to college?
Oh, I see.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.520
You're not leaving today, are you?
No, but...

02:31.520 --> 02:35.160
Cos there's a list of medicines to
make up, as long as your arm.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.920
Be glad to. Oh, and would you mind
answering the phone,

02:37.920 --> 02:39.560
morning and night.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.400
James and Mrs Hall are far too busy.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.800
HE SIGHS

02:42.800 --> 02:44.680
Stay calm. Don't enrage him.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.720
Siegfried? Don't!

02:48.720 --> 02:50.880
Don't what?

02:50.880 --> 02:53.840
Don't you think we do as well to
just get it over with?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.600
Once you've convinced me
you deserve it.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.960
I thought you wanted me
to go to college. No.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.600
I want you to pass your exams.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.920
I know from bitter experience,

03:04.920 --> 03:07.360
that one is not necessarily
followed by the other.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.560
It'll be different this time.
I'll apply myself.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.560
Hudson's instrument please.
If you want that cheque Tristan,

03:13.560 --> 03:16.040
you'll need to earn it.
What are you doing?

03:16.040 --> 03:18.440
SHE MOUTHS SILENTLY

03:22.920 --> 03:27.200
Thank you. It's a lot of money,
you can't just expect him

03:27.200 --> 03:29.960
to hand it over just like that.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.840
Especially if he thinks you're
gonna waste it. Stop that. Agh!

03:32.840 --> 03:34.560
You'll make the wall grubby.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.760
Keep your nose clean,
stay out of his whisky,

03:36.760 --> 03:38.080
and don't give him any excuse.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.720
Oh, you know me, good as gold.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.440
That your shade?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.960
Ah, we fell asleep on the sofa.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.880
Hop it, you.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.320
Thank you.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.200
Only one more week.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.640
Good morning, Mrs Pumphrey.
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.280
Let's take a look at you, Tricki.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.640
TRICKI GRUNTS, WHEEZES

04:41.160 --> 04:45.160
Can you hear all that rasping
and wheezing?

04:45.160 --> 04:49.400
It's like he's got a little steam
train inside him?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.240
I asked Francois to build the fires

04:51.240 --> 04:55.640
up, but it hasn't made much
difference. It's not the cold.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.560
Don't tell me it's the Spanish Flu.
I couldn't bare it.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.640
I've never heard of that crossing
over into the canine species before.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.560
It's not, a weak heart?

05:05.560 --> 05:09.000
You've been sticking to the diet
I prescribed?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.040
To the letter, Mr Herriot.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.840
One cup of biscuits, twice daily?

05:13.840 --> 05:16.200
Perhaps not every letter.

05:16.200 --> 05:22.480
We all need the odd treat or life
becomes a little dull.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.240
Don't you think?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.960
Tricki-woo is becoming
dangerously overweight.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.920
He's struggling to breathe.
He's going to die.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.840
He's not going to die.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.360
But he's been so listless,
Mr Herriot.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.880
I thought he must be suffering
from malnutrition, so I've been

05:39.880 --> 05:43.760
giving him a little extra between
meals, just to build him up.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.320
Dare I ask?

05:45.320 --> 05:48.000
A little calf's foot jelly,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.240
uh, cod liver oil, beef Wellington.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.320
And a bowl of Horlicks
at night to help him sleep.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.200
Oh, dear, he's never been
away from home before.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.160
Are you sure this is quite
necessary? Absolutely.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.360
We'll keep him at Skeldale House
under observation.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.120
That way, we can rule out
anything more serious.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.440
What's all this? Oh, just a few
essentials for Tricki.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.480
Can't have him going without.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.800
Oh, goodbye, my precious!

06:33.080 --> 06:35.760
Oh, this is too tragic.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.160
I'll take good care of him.
You have my word.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.160
DOG GROWLS, BARKS

06:50.360 --> 06:53.000
Vomiting again, he is.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.200
What did he have for breakfast?
DOG GROWLS

06:58.800 --> 07:00.560
HIGH`PITCHED RINGING

07:00.560 --> 07:02.320
HIS VOICE IS MUFFLED BY RINGING

07:02.320 --> 07:04.640
Oh, right. Any odds and sods.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.080
Leftovers from my dinner,
bones from the butcher.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.640
I catch him eating newspaper.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.680
Well, I think probably his diet

07:10.680 --> 07:13.040
might have something to do
with his upset stomach.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.360
Oh, I can't afford to be giving him
the tip-top stuff.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.040
DOG GROWLS
All right.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
Would you have a closer
look at him, then?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.280
DOG BARKS
Easy now.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.880
Err, he seems lively enough.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.080
Let's, erm, try some different
medication.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.280
See if that settles things down.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.880
What are you up to in here?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.040
Preparing the medicines, as ordered.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.920
Five drops in his water, every day.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.880
How much will that be then?
Oh, don't worry about that.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.800
We'll save that for you and Clancy.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.320
What's all this?

08:06.320 --> 08:10.280
Tricki's essentials. He's here for a
period of convalescence.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.120
Err, he won't be needing
his hamper of goodies.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.760
Oh, don't be too hasty, James,
we need to ease the poor boy in.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.800
Just pop it on the table over there.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.200
Thank you, Charlie.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.960
That dog is an absolute disgrace.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.160
It's not his fault. Mrs Pumphrey
overindulges him.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.680
All the fine foods, the pampering.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.960
It's done him no good whatsoever.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.560
He's been spoilt.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.600
I know it comes from a place of
love. Well, of sorts.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.040
He's learnt so many bad habits,
the eating, the lack of exercise.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.800
PHONE RINGS

08:46.800 --> 08:49.040
The inability to carry out the most
basic of instructions!

08:49.040 --> 08:50.680
I don't know.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.880
He gives paw pretty well. Paw.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.400
RINGING CONTINUES

08:54.400 --> 08:56.600
He can't even answer the bloody
phone!

08:56.600 --> 08:59.720
The phone? I mean,
I don't know how he ever would,

08:59.720 --> 09:01.960
that would be fairly extraordinary.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.560
Siegfried?

09:03.560 --> 09:07.040
Can you in fact hear that? What?
Don't worry. I'll get it.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.240
No, you won't! Don't you dare!
It's his job.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.000
I told him to do it,
and he'll damn well do it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.760
Don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.240
Well, I thought you wanted me
to answer the phone.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.160
Can no-one hear that? Don't answer
it! He has to do it.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.400
Genuinely no idea what you want me
to do.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.800
I'm fed up to the back
teeth with you!

09:21.800 --> 09:24.720
All you do is laze around, fattening
yourself, while I foot the bill!

09:24.720 --> 09:28.000
Ow! Well, you can
wave goodbye to your cheque,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.880
until you buck your bloody ideas up!

09:29.880 --> 09:31.800
RINGING CONTINUES

09:36.240 --> 09:38.200
Darrowby 2297.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.680
SHE CLEARS THROAT

09:49.680 --> 09:53.080
Oh, don't worry. I'll give these a
good scrub afterwards.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.400
Mm...

09:56.280 --> 09:58.480
I'm going to get you fighting
fit, Tricki.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.640
Shouldn't you be making
yourself useful?

10:03.640 --> 10:06.880
Hm? Oh, my brother's little
tantrum yesterday?

10:06.880 --> 10:08.840
No, I wouldn't worry about that,

10:08.840 --> 10:11.120
Mrs H, he'll want me gone soon
enough.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.720
Well, that may be so, but it
mightn't be to where you want to be.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.240
DOOR CLOSES

10:17.240 --> 10:19.040
Let me help you with that, Jim.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.040
Good morning, Siegfried.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.240
How much did you say it was Jim?
An ounce of biscuits?

10:24.240 --> 10:25.520
An ounce and a half.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.480
Jim has left me
in charge of Tricki today.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.960
More fool him. Actually, Tris...

10:29.960 --> 10:31.960
James is needed up at Dobson's.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.480
Helen called last night,

10:33.480 --> 10:35.880
her bull's having trouble
performing.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.040
She asked for him specifically.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.000
Oh, that'll be awkward! Why's that?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It won't be. It's not.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.640
Go on, then, James, you've a few to
get through this morning.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.880
I promised Mrs Pumphrey I'd take
good care of him...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.480
Which is why you entrusted me
with Tricki, hey?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.000
TRICKI YAPS
Ooh!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.800
Oh, you're not afraid of that little
thing?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.800
Being fearful is the sign of a
higher intellect.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.480
He needs regular exercise
and lots of water.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.720
Yes, yes. I think I can just about
manage.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.320
Will you come to church with me
this morning? Yes.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.760
Lord knows I have enough
to pray for.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.200
I'm doing your favourite,
roast beef. Ooh!

11:19.200 --> 11:21.640
Make sure you earn it.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.240
Understood. Shall we?

11:33.560 --> 11:36.000
Sorry, Tricki, doctor's orders!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.800
TRICKI GRUNTS

11:52.840 --> 11:54.880
Morning.. Thanks for coming.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.160
I thought you were gonna put
lead in his pencil,

11:57.160 --> 11:59.800
not a bullet in the back
of his head. No offence, lad.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.360
Now, Mr Dobson. You know James
was in the right on that one.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.960
Mm, aye. I understand Clive's having
some difficulty serving the cows.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.920
Aye, he's not showing much interest.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.160
Much? He's not been up on any of
'em.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.320
You said your bull will perform.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.040
And if he don't get 'em knocked up,
then I shan't be paying.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.520
How long's Clive been in with them?
A week now.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.720
Mr Dobson's been giving his cows
plenty of water,

12:25.720 --> 12:27.240
so he should smell 'em well enough.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.480
Has this happened before?

12:28.480 --> 12:32.280
Never. Most of the time it's getting
him to stop that's the trouble.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.160
From my experience that's
often the way. Really?

12:36.480 --> 12:38.320
With bulls.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.480
Shall we take a look at him?

12:40.480 --> 12:42.960
Hello, old friend. Remember me?

12:42.960 --> 12:44.600
BULL MOOS

13:00.480 --> 13:01.680
Tricki.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
Oi, Tricki.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.480
You left Tricki in the care
of Tristan? He'll be fine.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.240
He will, won't he?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.240
Is it all right down there?

13:20.240 --> 13:22.640
Impressive...and healthy.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.280
We'll give him a shot of
testosterone,

13:26.280 --> 13:28.200
see if that gets him going.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.040
Any idea how long that'll
take before it as an effect?

13:31.040 --> 13:33.360
Should be fairly immediate. Good.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.400
I don't know how you Dales
farmers do it,

13:40.400 --> 13:43.040
your livelihood's constantly at the
mercy of nature.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.720
We do our best to keep up with
the rent, Hugh's good to us,

13:45.720 --> 13:47.600
not that I like to ask it of him.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.280
He's your landlord?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.800
Since he inherited the estate.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.400
He lost his father around the same
time I did my mam.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.920
That's really what got us together.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.920
I got the impression it had been
going on longer.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.920
We've knocked about together
since we were kids,

14:00.920 --> 14:03.120
well, when he wasn't away at his
school, at any rate.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.240
That should perk him up a bit.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.240
Right. Don't you be shy, this time.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.720
We should probably make
a quick exit,

14:11.720 --> 14:14.040
the testosterone might make him
a tad aggressive.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.440
WHISTLING
Hello, Mr Herriot.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.240
Afternoon, Mrs Dobson!

14:19.240 --> 14:21.120
I'll see you at the house.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.360
Hope you didn't have a big
breakfast. Why's that? You'll see.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.400
Go on, lad. Don't be shy.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.720
Go on!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.680
BULL MOOS

14:51.360 --> 14:52.640
Tricki.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.240
DOOR OPENS
Come in, Mr Mulligan.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.960
I'm sorry to put you
out like this, Mr Farnon.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.480
Clancy was sick again this morning.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.680
No trouble at all, we would never
leave an animal in distress.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.200
We have not stopped all morning.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.480
Just point me in the right
direction, Siegfried,

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
no task is too great. Then you'll

15:09.960 --> 15:11.800
have no qualms about examining
Clancy?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.520
CLANCY BARKS
Oh, good God!

15:17.160 --> 15:19.720
What a delightful animal.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.800
If you'd just like to come through
here. Yes. Come on Clancy. Come on.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.480
Sieg...

15:31.040 --> 15:33.000
CLANCY BARKS

15:33.000 --> 15:34.240
All right. There you go.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.040
CLANCY BARKS

15:39.040 --> 15:41.560
What seems to be the problem, Joe?

15:43.160 --> 15:45.200
Well, he's still vomiting bad, he
is.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.920
MR Farnon gave him some medication

15:46.920 --> 15:49.360
but it don't seem to have done the
trick. I see.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.960
You'll be wanting to have a good
look over him, then? Hmm? Oh, yes.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.000
Yes. Naturally. Yes.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.960
CLANCY BARKS

16:01.800 --> 16:04.440
DISTANT BARKING

16:04.440 --> 16:06.880
TRICKI GROANS
Not on your nelly.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.000
DISTANT BARKING

16:11.000 --> 16:13.320
HE CHUCKLES

16:13.320 --> 16:15.520
DOOR OPENS

16:15.520 --> 16:18.080
Joe. Joe.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.480
This should be enough to last
you a week or so.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.720
Well, thank you kindly, sir.
Real gentleman, isn't he, Clancy?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.880
Come on Clans.
DOOR OPENS, CLOSES

16:30.480 --> 16:33.000
How can he love something
so ferocious?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.720
No doubt he faced worse
terrors on the front.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.040
Many men like him
lost their hearing as a result.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.120
Was the hound much trouble?
Oh, not really.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.160
He seemed lively enough.
Just needs to improve his diet.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.040
So now we're responsible for feeding

16:48.040 --> 16:50.240
every poorly nourished
dog in Darrowby?

16:50.240 --> 16:53.600
Siegfried, it's one packet of food.
Oh, I know. That's kind of you.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.120
We can't make a habit of it.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.720
Even though his bad diet is probably
the root cause of the vomiting?

16:58.720 --> 17:01.840
What do you mean by probably?
Possibly. Apparently. Presumably.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.680
I know what it means.
Why say it? You should know!

17:04.680 --> 17:07.280
Well, can anyone ever be certain?

17:07.280 --> 17:10.440
I take it you did a full examination
to rule out, anything else?

17:10.440 --> 17:12.360
Mm-hm. Yes.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.160
As I'm sure you did,
when you last saw him?

17:15.160 --> 17:18.120
Naturally.
Well, there we are then.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.720
Come on, Tricki,
time for another walk.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.840
Thank you for the feast, Mrs Dobson.

17:26.840 --> 17:31.680
Here, take these sausages,
Mr Herriot. Bye, love.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.560
God, you could roll me home.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.760
Dales hospitality.
One of the perks of the job.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.120
I haven't given you so much as a
glass of water.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.560
I'm feeling guilty now.
Oh, don't be.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.000
I could give you a lift home
if you like. It's really no bother.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.720
Oh, thanks.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.800
Is that Hugh?

18:15.320 --> 18:18.560
Problem? Nothing for you to worry
yourself about, Herriot.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.120
Helen. Hello, Hugh.
What a lovely surprise?

18:25.120 --> 18:29.000
James gave me a lift back from
Mr Dobson's.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.160
Very gallant of you.

18:31.160 --> 18:37.120
See you've thrown a shoe. Hm?
Flat tyre. Right, yes. Funny.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.600
I've already sent for a mechanic.
He should be along in a moment.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.080
I don't mind giving it a go.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.280
Is there a tool kit in the back?

18:44.280 --> 18:47.120
Um... You know, I've no idea.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.840
Really, Herriot, it's actually quite
a valuable car.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.160
Well, James sounds like he knows
what he's doing.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.240
Come on, please, Tricki, the pub's
just there, it's no distance at all.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.240
Hey. There might be a lady dog in
there.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.880
TRICKI GRUNTS

19:10.960 --> 19:13.120
I won't crack.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.360
I'm not carrying you. Genuinely.
I'm not.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.000
Siegfried will let me jump through
one hoop after another.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.320
TRICKI BARKS
Aww! Isn't he just gorgeous.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.360
Eventually the hoops will get
so high, that I'll get caught

19:32.360 --> 19:35.360
halfway and be left dangling
with my backside in the wind.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.880
Now that's a lovely image.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.960
HE CLEARS THROAT
Can I hold him?

19:40.960 --> 19:42.200
Be my guest.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.080
Hello! Come here.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.840
I need to get Tricki walking

19:47.840 --> 19:50.440
and lose weight to get my cheque
from Siegfried.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.880
You know, Maggie, I'm beginning to
wonder

19:54.880 --> 19:56.920
if you're really engaging with
this problem of mine.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.320
You want him to give you money and
he wants you to earn it, doesn't he?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.560
Yes. Which I do?

20:03.400 --> 20:07.280
Not long ago I was on this very spot
collecting debts for the business.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.360
And spending it as quickly as it
came in.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.160
He got what he was due. You'd think

20:12.160 --> 20:14.720
he might start showing some faith in
me. What?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.720
You mean when he asks you to do
something,

20:16.720 --> 20:18.680
he expects you'll shirk off instead
of getting on with it?

20:18.680 --> 20:22.480
Outrageous! Hm. It's not my fault.
The dog won't walk.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.200
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know, Tristan.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.800
It would take a mind greater
than mine to work that one out.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.600
TRICKI GRUNTS SOFTLY

20:36.160 --> 20:39.080
Maggie, do you have any string?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.920
# Such horrible dreams which you
very much better be awake

20:51.920 --> 20:54.320
# For you dream you are crossing
The Channel

20:54.320 --> 20:56.280
# And tossing About in a steamer
from Harwich

20:56.280 --> 20:58.680
# Which is something between
a large bathing machine

20:58.680 --> 21:00.960
# And a very small
second-class carriage

21:00.960 --> 21:02.640
# And you're giving a treat
Penny ice and cold meat

21:02.640 --> 21:04.840
# To a party of friends
and relations

21:04.840 --> 21:06.520
# They're a ravenous horde
and they all came on board

21:06.520 --> 21:08.280
# At Sloane Square
and South Kensington stations

21:08.280 --> 21:10.120
# And bound on that journey
you find your attorney

21:10.120 --> 21:11.840
# Who started that morning
from Devon

21:11.840 --> 21:13.680
# He's a bit undersized

21:13.680 --> 21:15.120
# And you don't feel surprised

21:15.120 --> 21:16.840
# When he tells you
he's only eleven... #

21:16.840 --> 21:19.080
You better not be spoiling your
appetite.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.800
No. I was, just, um, taking stock.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.000
Why? What've you got planned for us?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.160
Roast Beef with all the trimmings.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.440
Would you like to be the man
that's more hands on?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.240
Stop it! Stop it.
James is right there...

21:49.240 --> 21:51.680
Why should he care? All done.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.000
Stop it, Hugh. Be kind.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.800
Good man, much appreciated.
My pleasure.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.320
And sincerely, I would never have
managed.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.320
I'm not really that mechanically
minded.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.600
My school didn't really
go in for that sort of thing.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.800
He did study Ancient Greek though.
Oh, yes.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.760
Incredibly useful round these parts.
I bet.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.320
Well, thanks again for this.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.400
And for what you did for...for
Andante.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.440
I think James was almost as upset
about it, as you were. Hm.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.520
Father made me shoot a stag once.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.560
Beautiful thing.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.080
Felt rotten about it after.
Never again.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.240
You giving me a lift back? I think
we've put James out enough already.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.240
Love to. Bye, James. Bye.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.160
Well, Mrs Hall, this is certainly a
lot of food.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.880
Well, you've all been hard at it all

22:57.880 --> 23:00.080
day, I expect you've worked up an
appetite.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.440
DOOR OPENS, CLOSES

23:15.440 --> 23:17.400
Something smells delicious.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.040
Oh, God, my feet are killing me.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.320
You don't mean you've been
walking him all this time?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.920
Must've done three or four miles,
at least.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.080
I'll have Tricki-woo in tip-top
shape in no time.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.600
What's wrong wi' you?
Seen a sparrow eat more.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.600
And you. Normally it's like feeding
gannets.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.400
I don't suppose there's any more
gravy?

24:01.560 --> 24:05.800
Dobson's? Ate my own weight
in Yorkshire puddings.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.840
You? Mrs Pumphrey's pork
pies are certainly quite moreish.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.080
And then there was the pate.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.000
Gentlemen, never fear.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.320
METAL JANGLES
Ah!

24:16.320 --> 24:18.840
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.240
Anything to help you, Siegfried.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.880
Hm.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.920
Good boy. Mm.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.640
Ah.

25:04.717 --> 25:06.197
PHONE RINGS

25:11.077 --> 25:13.797

25:18.397 --> 25:20.317
RINGING CONTINUES

25:20.317 --> 25:21.637
Uh!

25:23.957 --> 25:25.837
Oh, God! Ugh!

25:27.837 --> 25:28.917
Oh, no. I'm coming...

PHONE RINGS

25:37.877 --> 25:39.677
Coming!
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH RAPIDLY

Darrowby 2297.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.917
Mrs Pumphrey.

25:45.917 --> 25:48.717
Oh, I, I feel simply ghastly.

25:48.717 --> 25:51.637
I haven't slept a wink.
Mrs Pumphrey, I assure you,

25:51.637 --> 25:53.277
Tricki's absolutely fine.

25:53.277 --> 25:56.157
Can I have a little word? Go ahead.

25:58.797 --> 26:01.997
Oh, you mean with Tricki?

26:01.997 --> 26:03.917
Of course.

26:03.917 --> 26:05.957
Here, Tricki.

26:12.717 --> 26:15.797
There we go. Here we go.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.277
Speak to Mummy.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.957
Speak.
TRICKI GRUNTS

26:27.197 --> 26:28.757
HE BARKS

26:31.357 --> 26:35.957
Oh, he sounds so hoarse.

26:35.957 --> 26:38.957
Give him a little kiss from Mummy.

26:38.957 --> 26:40.997
A kiss? Of course.

26:42.597 --> 26:44.437
Mwah.

26:53.477 --> 26:55.717
SHE CHUCKLES

26:55.717 --> 26:57.197
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!

27:02.757 --> 27:06.117
Oh, that phone has not stopped
all morning.

27:06.117 --> 27:08.317
Set yourself down, Triss.
I'll get you some breakfast.

27:08.317 --> 27:09.997
Mrs Pumphrey happy?

27:09.997 --> 27:12.477
Utterly bonkers, but seems pleased
enough.

27:12.477 --> 27:14.437
Now, could've been the gin talking,

27:14.437 --> 27:17.157
but I think Tricki might have
gained a new uncle.

27:17.157 --> 27:20.717
Oh, and Dobson called for you, Jim.
Said not to bother going up to

27:20.717 --> 27:22.117
check on Clive again, apparently

27:22.117 --> 27:25.277
he's sewing his oats all over the
place. That's fantastic news!

27:25.277 --> 27:28.197
Fort Clive, I mean. And the cows,
obviously.

27:28.197 --> 27:31.397
The Aldersons, that beast brings
in a tidy sum.

27:31.397 --> 27:33.117
Helen will be pleased.

27:35.917 --> 27:38.077
I'd best be going.

27:38.077 --> 27:39.917
It's all right to leave Tricki
with you again? Mm-hm.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.957
I've a full day's
activities planned for us.

27:42.957 --> 27:44.717
So, Siegfried, I hate to nag,

27:44.717 --> 27:48.757
but have you given any more
consideration towards that cheque?

27:48.757 --> 27:50.597
I have.

27:51.757 --> 27:55.317
Only it'll take some time to
clear before I can spend any of it.

27:55.317 --> 27:59.557
There are lots of books I need,
you know. For studying.

27:59.557 --> 28:02.317
PHONE RINGS
Oh. No-one move.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.557
You see. Properly motivated,
he pulls his finger out.

28:17.357 --> 28:19.237
Dobson called.

28:19.237 --> 28:22.997
Oh, right. Here, make yourself
useful.

28:25.877 --> 28:28.037
I am pleased to report that Clive

28:28.037 --> 28:31.477
is having a rare old time with
Dobson's cows.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.197
Oh, James, that's fantastic news!

28:33.197 --> 28:36.717
Here. Wait there.
I'm baking something.

28:36.717 --> 28:39.157
You don't have to do that.
No, back in a minute. Wait there.

28:43.797 --> 28:45.517
Oh, sugar.

28:49.837 --> 28:51.157
What are you doing with our eggs?

28:51.157 --> 28:54.197
Oh, I was just helping... Yeah,
helping yourself? No, no, no.

28:54.197 --> 28:57.037
Listen, I work damn hard keeping
this place going.

28:57.037 --> 28:59.717
Do you think I'm gonna stand here,
and watch a bloody thief?

28:59.717 --> 29:02.237
I'm the vet, Siegfried's assistant.

29:02.237 --> 29:03.557
I'm James Herriot.

29:05.197 --> 29:07.517
Right. What're you doing up here,
then?

29:07.517 --> 29:11.757
I was...I was telling Helen
about Clive.

29:11.757 --> 29:14.237
He's doing well now at Dobsons farm.

29:14.237 --> 29:17.517
Afternoon. James. Our Helen's just
burning something for you.

29:17.517 --> 29:19.677
Hello, Jenny.

29:19.677 --> 29:23.077
She wants to thank me
for getting Clive going.

29:23.077 --> 29:25.917
Right. Are we not paying you for
that, then?

29:25.917 --> 29:28.877
Leave him be, Dad, it's just
something to say,

29:28.877 --> 29:31.397
thank you for everything James has
done. They look great.

29:32.557 --> 29:35.117
You might want to scrape
the top off. Yeah.

29:35.117 --> 29:37.717
You might want to bring him
my chisel, Jenny.

29:37.717 --> 29:39.757
SHE CHUCKLES

29:39.757 --> 29:42.157
Hmm...
CHUCKLING

29:42.157 --> 29:45.477
Delicious. They're not too terrible?

29:46.477 --> 29:48.517
Quite a unique flavour.

29:48.517 --> 29:50.437
They're awful, aren't they?

29:50.437 --> 29:54.797
Honestly...some of the worst I've
ever had.

29:54.797 --> 29:56.757
OTHERS LAUGH

30:31.077 --> 30:32.997
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

31:05.077 --> 31:07.757
Afternoon. Afternoon, Mr Farnon.

31:09.317 --> 31:11.517
When did that come back?

31:11.517 --> 31:15.197
What did you call me?
Patron Saint of Lost Causes?

31:15.197 --> 31:18.357
Among many other much more
flattering things.

31:20.557 --> 31:24.117
I'll drive you to Scarborough,
we won't stop until we find him.

31:24.117 --> 31:26.317
I've chased Edward long enough.

31:28.277 --> 31:29.597
He knows where I am.

31:33.997 --> 31:35.277
Tris?

31:36.437 --> 31:38.357
Oh, set yourself down, I'll make you
some tea.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.757
No, I'm not ready to rest yet.

31:39.757 --> 31:42.837
I want to weigh Tricki,
to chart his progress.

31:45.317 --> 31:48.357
Go on, stop punishing him.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.837
He's done everything you asked
and more.

32:09.117 --> 32:10.597
HE SIGHS

32:13.837 --> 32:15.997
How's he getting on? Yes, well...

32:15.997 --> 32:19.397
Well? Very well, actually. Good.

32:19.397 --> 32:20.837
All that hard graft paying off.

32:20.837 --> 32:23.277
Feel like I've shed a few
pounds too. Let's see, then.

32:23.277 --> 32:25.997
Oh, I don't think I'll quite fit on
there. Not you, man. The dog.

32:25.997 --> 32:29.517
It's only been two days, it'd be
unusual to see too much change.

32:29.517 --> 32:32.237
You just said he was doing
very well?

32:32.237 --> 32:33.757
I think I said he was well.

32:33.757 --> 32:38.077
And I asked, "Well?" And you said,
"Very well, actually."

32:38.077 --> 32:39.837
Did I? You did.

32:41.557 --> 32:43.397
Put him on the scales.

32:43.397 --> 32:45.717
Look, I've been measuring out
his food, walking him constantly.

32:45.717 --> 32:47.197
I swear... On the scales.

32:57.477 --> 33:02.277
He's heavier. I don't know why,
I expected anything different.

33:03.437 --> 33:04.877
What's that supposed to mean?

33:04.877 --> 33:08.397
Four-mile walks?
Meticulous monitoring of his diet?

33:08.397 --> 33:10.597
Why do you never fail to
live down to my expectations.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.117
Now hang on a minute, that's not
fair. Just when I thought

33:13.117 --> 33:15.117
you might've changed. I should've
known better.

33:15.117 --> 33:17.437
I'm telling you the truth.
I have been walking him.

33:17.437 --> 33:19.917
I'm sorry, I don't believe you.

33:19.917 --> 33:22.437
And if you think I'm gonna throw
good money after bad,

33:22.437 --> 33:23.637
you've got another thing coming.

33:23.637 --> 33:25.517
Mr Farnon, wait a minute.

33:25.517 --> 33:27.157
DOOR SLAMS

33:27.157 --> 33:28.237
Tris...?

33:34.317 --> 33:36.677
TRICKI GRUNTS

33:38.197 --> 33:40.037
Hold on a minute. Tristan.

33:40.037 --> 33:42.037
DOOR CLOSES
Oh!

33:43.117 --> 33:45.517
DOOR BELL DINGS

33:45.517 --> 33:47.757
SHE SIGHS

33:58.037 --> 34:00.317
Mrs Pumphrey. I'm so sorry, I...

34:02.637 --> 34:05.597
I couldn't stay away a minute
longer.

34:05.597 --> 34:07.317
Oh, it's hard, isn't it?

34:07.317 --> 34:10.077
Come on in. They're all out at the

34:10.077 --> 34:13.677
moment, but I'm sure they'll be back
soon.

34:13.677 --> 34:17.157
Oh, and Tricki?

34:18.517 --> 34:20.037
He's around here somewhere.

34:20.037 --> 34:22.877
Set yourself down,
I'll make you some tea.

34:22.877 --> 34:24.157
Charming little house.

34:24.157 --> 34:28.477
So, so compact and functional.

34:28.477 --> 34:30.197
Like a Swiss army knife.

34:31.637 --> 34:32.757
Hm.

34:34.317 --> 34:36.357
SHE SIGHS

34:42.397 --> 34:44.117
Oh, those boys.

34:48.037 --> 34:49.797
Oh.

34:53.077 --> 34:54.957
DOOR CLOSES

34:54.957 --> 34:57.117
Tea. Good idea, Mrs Hall.

34:57.117 --> 34:58.557
Well, It's not for you.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.517
Mrs Pumphrey's here.

35:00.517 --> 35:02.237
I can't find Tricki.

35:10.677 --> 35:13.237
Mrs Pumphrey. I do apologise.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.797
I'm afraid you've just
missed Tricki.

35:15.797 --> 35:20.037
James or, uh, Tristan,
or possibly even both of them,

35:20.037 --> 35:21.957
have taken him for a walk.

35:21.957 --> 35:23.917
Uh, they may be some time.

35:23.917 --> 35:28.517
I'll wait, if that's not too much
trouble. No, of course not.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.517
HE MOUTHS SILENTLY

35:36.517 --> 35:39.477
You quite all right? What? Yes, um,

35:39.477 --> 35:41.677
gin, wasn't it, your tipple of
choice?

35:41.677 --> 35:43.637
It's twelve o'clock.

35:43.637 --> 35:45.997
Your housekeeper offered me
a cup of tea.

35:45.997 --> 35:47.477
Coming, Mrs Pumphrey.

35:51.677 --> 35:53.117
Oh, Tricki!

35:53.117 --> 35:55.277
Is that Tricki? Tricki!

35:55.277 --> 35:57.477
Well, where is he? I'm sorry, who?

35:57.477 --> 35:59.237
We were just telling Mrs Pumphrey

35:59.237 --> 36:01.677
about all the exercise Tricki's been
getting.

36:01.677 --> 36:03.677
Oh. He doesn't leave Tristan's side.

36:03.677 --> 36:07.357
That is patently a lie.
Would you excuse us a minute?

36:07.357 --> 36:08.917
We can't find Tricki-woo.

36:08.917 --> 36:12.397
Is it possible he left with you?
Me? No, what about you?

36:12.397 --> 36:15.397
MUFFLED: Why would he leave with me?
Maybe you left the door open.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.597
I am far to careful. It must have
been you.

36:17.597 --> 36:20.357
Both of you quiet down!
Check upstairs. Quickly. Go on.

36:27.637 --> 36:29.557
Oh, thank you.

36:33.437 --> 36:34.837
Tricki-woo!

36:44.117 --> 36:45.797
What would I do without him?

36:45.797 --> 36:47.397
WHISTLING

36:47.397 --> 36:49.597
And you're sure you've looked
absolutely everywhere? Yes.

36:49.597 --> 36:51.997
Upstairs. Every bedroom.
Even under Tristan's bed.

36:51.997 --> 36:54.597
You know there are actual toadstools
growing there. He must've got out.

36:54.597 --> 36:56.157
Let's organise a search party.

36:56.157 --> 36:58.477
Oh, God, I can't believe
we've lost him. Poor little man.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.637
Who've you lost?

37:00.637 --> 37:02.677
Tricki!? Oh, my God!

37:02.677 --> 37:05.997
James, well done! Oh, thank the
Lord. Oh, no see this.

37:05.997 --> 37:08.837
He's been at the liquors.

37:08.837 --> 37:11.597
And God knows what else!
We'll have to tell Mrs Pumphrey.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.957
No. It would only upset her and slow
us down. We need to sedate him

37:14.957 --> 37:16.677
and give him a stomach pump now!

37:22.600 --> 37:24.560
Try not to worry.

37:24.560 --> 37:28.600
I'll have James call you as soon
as he's back from his walk.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.800
That would be kind.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.680
She gone, let's get to it. Mask.
Uh... I think it's in my jacket.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.560
Here.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.720
There we are.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.360
There we are.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.360
That's it.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.800
That's it.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.760
How on Earth did he get into the
hamper?

38:16.760 --> 38:19.040
Why are you looking at me?

38:19.040 --> 38:22.160
I should never have left him
with you. Chocolate, alcohol.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.360
There's no telling what it could
do to his insides.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.520
And why's that my fault?

38:25.520 --> 38:27.720
I haven't seen or touched that
hamper since it arrived.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.320
I don't know how he got into it,
but it has nothing to do me.

38:32.280 --> 38:36.520
Jim. I promise you,
this is nothing to do with me.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.960
Why is everything around here always
my fault? Because it usually is!

38:40.960 --> 38:44.880
Who else would be stupid enough to
leave a hamper someplace

38:44.880 --> 38:47.520
Tricki could get at it!
Perhaps the recriminations can wait

38:47.520 --> 38:50.840
until Tricki's finished his
treatment. And perhaps they can't!

38:53.720 --> 38:55.400
Yes, well, um...

38:57.520 --> 39:02.800
I don't think, in this case,
Tristan is entirely to blame.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.520
If at all, really.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.960
You see, if he weren't so addicted
to a rich diet,

39:14.960 --> 39:17.480
he wouldn't have sought it out in
the first place.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.000
Siegfried?

39:24.160 --> 39:27.160
The hamper was left on the floor
of the study...

39:28.280 --> 39:30.240
..by me.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.520
Tristan is not to blame, James.
I am.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.640
He did nothing wrong.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.400
It was me.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.640
Jim. Yes? Are we hallucinating?

39:45.640 --> 39:48.760
Yes, all right, it was my bloody
fault. There's no need to rub it in!

39:50.000 --> 39:52.720
Sorry. Oh, don't worry about it.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.080
It was worth it to hear him
say that.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.880
Will Tricki be all right?

39:58.880 --> 40:01.800
Once we get some fluids into him,
he should start to recover. Hm.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.000
Fluids!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.960
TRICKI BARKS

40:33.960 --> 40:35.080
Oh, my boofoms!

40:37.600 --> 40:41.600
Oh, my boofoms is home.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.840
My goodness, he feels like a sack
of spanners.

40:47.840 --> 40:51.200
He must be starving. Tricki's been
on a carefully regulated diet

40:51.200 --> 40:52.680
and his condition's much improved.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.680
And we've taken a lot of walks
this last week. Haven't we, Tricki?

40:55.680 --> 40:58.440
Oh, doesn't he just
love his Uncle Triss?

41:00.040 --> 41:01.960
Remember his diet, Mrs Pumphrey.

41:01.960 --> 41:07.880
Yes, yes. Two cups of dried biscuits
and ONLY brown meat.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.880
Bye, Tricki. Mrs Pumphrey.

41:10.880 --> 41:15.760
Darling. Oh, Mummy loves you!

41:17.920 --> 41:20.400
James will take you on to the
station,

41:20.400 --> 41:24.080
there's no sense in all of us
being there. No. I suppose not.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.520
I'll see you at Christmas, then.
Yep.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.600
What? You're not waiting for a hug?
We're not huggers now, are we?

41:37.600 --> 41:40.840
God, no. There's still the small
matter of the... Oh, of course.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.000
TRICKI BARKS

41:44.240 --> 41:46.240
Isn't that lovely?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.760
If not, I'm going to eat some of
this.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.040
Yes.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.240
Oh, yummy. Unbelievable.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.360
I can't begin to tell you what this
means, I won't let you down.

42:00.040 --> 42:03.000
It is the definition of insanity,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.720
doing the same thing over and over

42:04.720 --> 42:06.920
again and expecting a different
result.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.480
Siegfried, what's happening?
It's not you Tris.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.280
I've seen with my own eyes
what you can achieve

42:11.280 --> 42:12.920
when you put your mind to it.

42:12.920 --> 42:15.400
It's these damn tutors letting you
down. No. No. They really haven't,

42:15.400 --> 42:17.440
they're all first-rate.
I'll teach you!

42:17.440 --> 42:19.480
Come Winter you can sit your exams
again.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.720
Under my guidance, I have no doubt
you'll sail through!

42:29.760 --> 42:31.360
HE SIGHS

42:33.960 --> 42:35.880
You're back?
What have you forgotten?

42:35.880 --> 42:37.240
That my brother's a lunatic.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.680
Siegfried's decided to tutor
Tristan himself.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.400
You're staying! Oh, dear.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.800
You know, that must be hard.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.400
It's going to be torture.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.880
I'm sure he means well.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.280
I for one am glad you're staying.

42:48.280 --> 42:51.800
The only reason he's doing it is to
punish me. For what? I have no idea.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.000
Maybe it's because you lied about
passing your exams.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.960
I didn't lie, technically.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.320
You do drink his best whisky.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.040
I honestly can't tell
the difference.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.960
Well, that makes it worse.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.960
What about the time you spent
all his money in the Drovers?

43:03.960 --> 43:07.400
What's that? Nothing Mrs H,
just Jim being funny. Trying to be.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.600
DOOR OPENS
Tristan!

43:09.600 --> 43:10.920
Oh, here we go.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.680
Ah, there you are.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.560
I've brought back someone very

43:15.560 --> 43:17.800
special for your first
practical experience.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.600
I'm giddy with anticipation.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.160
CLANCY GROWLS
Mr Farnon.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.200
CLANCY BARKS, GROWLS

43:28.080 --> 43:30.280
Clancy means the world to
Mr Mulligan.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
I think we owe it to both of them

43:33.840 --> 43:38.320
to carry out a full physical
examination. Don't you?

43:40.840 --> 43:42.080
Right, Clancy.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.280
CLANCY BARKS

43:44.280 --> 43:49.040
Ah, look at him smiling. I reckon
he's a fan of yours, Mr Farnon.

43:51.080 --> 43:54.280
Mr Mulligan, does it not scare you
when you hear him growl like...?

43:56.520 --> 43:58.560
Mr Mulligan? Ah, good boy.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.600
Mr Mulligan? That's my boy.
There now.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.720
No, of course it doesn't.

44:15.480 --> 44:19.360
Siegfried, I think the bark may be
far worse than the bite.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.440
Good boy!

44:23.440 --> 44:26.880
You're not so fierce, are you?
Aww, good boy!

44:29.040 --> 44:30.560
Aww!

44:42.920 --> 44:45.960
