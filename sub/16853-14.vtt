mattered most -- the
healing power of laughter.

08:29.373 --> 08:34.410
Because whenever medicine let
him down, laughter lifted him

08:34.477 --> 08:39.683
up, soaring as if he were some
kind of animal that could fly.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.785
Crazy, right -- an airborne animal?

08:42.854 --> 08:43.787
Glenn: An airbornimal.

08:43.855 --> 08:45.756
Lola: Let's call it an airbornimal.

08:45.790 --> 08:50.761
And if you can believe in an
animal that could fly, then also

08:50.795 --> 08:52.763
imagine that it laughs.

08:52.831 --> 08:56.066
So until the day comes that a
new doctor made up like a clown

08:56.101 --> 09:02.206
appears in our lives...
Blake, you will be missed.

09:05.309 --> 09:06.543
David: And cut.

09:06.577 --> 09:07.811
Lynn: Euehhhhh.

09:07.846 --> 09:09.479
Oh, it was a mouthful.

09:09.513 --> 09:10.647
What about birds, right?

09:10.681 --> 09:12.582
Birds are animals that can fly, right?

09:12.650 --> 09:13.851
Lady Jane: Oh, God.

09:13.885 --> 09:14.852
Are you serious?

09:14.886 --> 09:16.553
Oh, my God. That was endless.

09:16.587 --> 09:19.656
Louis: Cutter Spindell's
family generously donated his

09:19.724 --> 09:23.393
real corpse to be used in his
character's funeral scene.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.203
But the question remains, can
"Childrens Hospital" go on

09:33.238 --> 09:34.671
without one of its stars?

09:34.739 --> 09:36.573
Short answer -- yes.

09:36.641 --> 09:38.876
Long answer -- yes, it can.

09:38.943 --> 09:45.649
Next week, the goliath grouper, or jewfish--
do they control the riverbanks?

09:45.683 --> 09:48.385
And more of my conversation
with Kate Walsh.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.387
Kate: [ Laughs ] Ohhhh!

09:54.558 --> 09:57.694
Louis: Next week on "Newsreaders."

09:57.762 --> 10:00.697
[ Theme music plays ]

10:03.501 --> 10:05.402
So, you're thinking of having children?

10:05.436 --> 10:07.871
Cutter: Well, you know,
when I meet the right girl.

10:07.939 --> 10:10.774
Louis: Well, could you
pick a better girl?

10:10.809 --> 10:14.878
Cutter: No, I think -- I think
this is a guest, your next guest.

10:14.946 --> 10:18.481
Louis: Oh, you're my -- oh,
yes, the artist, of course.

10:18.516 --> 10:19.783
Well, let's get drunk.

10:19.851 --> 10:21.051
Cutter: All right.

10:21.085 --> 10:24.321
This will be my first
drink in 25 years.

10:26.624 --> 10:28.058
Ohh!

10:31.095 --> 10:33.430
Oh! Daddy's back!

10:33.497 --> 10:35.265
Daddy's back!

10:35.333 --> 10:36.700
[ Laughs ]

10:36.767 --> 10:38.609
Oh, let's get another one, huh?

10:38.729 --> 10:40.091
Don't touch me, man.

10:40.211 --> 10:47.040
