00:01.627 --> 00:03.796
Hey, buddy!

00:03.879 --> 00:05.339
You missed it, didn't you?

00:05.423 --> 00:06.924
Last week.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.926
Want to know what happened?

00:09.010 --> 00:10.886
Huh?

00:11.804 --> 00:13.389
Give me a buck.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.474
Ooh!
<i>Met a woman.</i>

00:15.558 --> 00:17.393
<i>Crazy as a loon.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:19.854
<i>Made my heart stir
and my loins moist.</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:22.064
Dr. Jones?
Dr. Ingrid Jones?

00:22.148 --> 00:24.650
My medications were off.
Wasn't the real me.

00:24.734 --> 00:27.737
I think it was the real you,
and I loved it.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.780
<i>Probably the worst lay
I've ever had.</i>

00:29.864 --> 00:31.699
<i>You fuck for shit.</i>

00:31.782 --> 00:33.075
Fuck you, I fuck for shit.

00:33.159 --> 00:34.577
See you later, Jabby!

00:34.660 --> 00:35.953
<i>You sure Fiona said
she was gonna drive you?</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:36.954
<i>Yep.</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.205
I'm gonna miss you.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.540
I love you guys.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.545
If I don't come up
with 25 grand,

00:44.628 --> 00:47.131
I'm gonna be in default
on my partnership agreement

00:47.214 --> 00:51.177
and lose
my $100,000 investment.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.056
Then I'll have to foreclose
on my apartment building.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.807
- Is Ford here?
- I got this, Patty.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.476
You said Patty
was your mother.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.393
I'm his wife.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.020
I'm such a fucking idiot!

01:01.103 --> 01:02.104
- Take your fucking hands...
- No!

01:02.188 --> 01:04.398
- ...off my car!
- Fiona!

01:09.111 --> 01:10.196
Fuck.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.489
Fiona!

- Smoke?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.239
Does anyone smell smoke?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.824
It's not the smoke alarm.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.868
Where is that sound
coming from?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.286
You know, it could be a bomb.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.871
It's not a bomb.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.002
Watch out, bud.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.934
Oh, fucker.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.312
Ian.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.730
Shithead.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.231
Genius.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.108
Oh, that's so sweet.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.985
He doesn't want us
to forget him.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.404
Yeah, it's real sweet.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.740
All right,
go to bed, guys.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.095
Three, two,

03:40.179 --> 03:42.139
one, go!

03:44.934 --> 03:47.228
Whoo!

03:48.354 --> 03:49.980
Wha-ho!
Well?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.191
- Five and a half seconds.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

03:52.274 --> 03:54.318
I knew it!
I knew that Vaseline

03:54.401 --> 03:56.278
would make better lube
than lube.

03:56.362 --> 03:57.988
We're smoking now.
I got

03:58.072 --> 03:59.949
some velocity down there.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.617
<i>Ingrid?
You okay in there?</i>

04:01.700 --> 04:03.577
Your neighbors
are a pain in the ass.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.287
No, it's my ex-husband.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.830
He thinks he can look after me

04:06.914 --> 04:08.791
just because we share
a duplex wall.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.875
Oh.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.961
I'm fine, Randy!
Go back to bed!

04:12.044 --> 04:13.379
<i>You sure, hon?
Maybe I should come in.</i>

04:13.462 --> 04:15.130
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm on a date.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.383
Never been better.
Bye!

04:17.466 --> 04:18.676
Man.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.469
I never realized
how much fun

04:20.552 --> 04:22.471
indoor tobogganing
could be.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.139
It should be a thing.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.809
You know, you shouldn't
have to be off your meds

04:26.892 --> 04:29.144
to have this much fun.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.188
It is fun.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.066
- Fuck, you have strong weed.
- Uh-huh.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.360
It's supposed to make you
really sleepy,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.445
but I don't know.
It just makes me all--

04:38.529 --> 04:40.614
vroom--alive.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.241
Well, when you wave
that flag in front of me,

04:42.324 --> 04:43.867
I feel like a bull
standing before

04:43.951 --> 04:46.412
a matador in "Barthelona."

04:47.705 --> 04:50.416
My little
Spanish-English muffin.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.959
All right, my turn.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.502
- All right, suit up.
- Okay, lube me up.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.712
Let's go.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.046
- To the top! Here we go!
- Okay.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.299
Whee!

05:02.720 --> 05:04.972
All right, guys,
cereal or toast?

05:05.055 --> 05:06.515
Do you have the stuff
to make pancakes?

05:06.598 --> 05:07.975
Pancakes?
Let's make pancakes.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.226
All right, let me rephrase.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.436
Cereal, toast, or nothing?

05:10.519 --> 05:11.520
Toast.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.105
Cereal.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.442
Oh, what's with the suit?
Somebody die?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.610
No, Brad's baby's
getting christened today.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.487
Christening?
Is that where you get the wine

05:20.571 --> 05:21.613
and shitty little cracker?

05:21.697 --> 05:22.990
No, that's confirmation.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.074
Christening's when you...

05:24.158 --> 05:25.492
waterboard the baby.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.702
All right,
we gotta divide and conquer

05:26.785 --> 05:28.912
now that school's out.
Who's gonna watch Liam today?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.372
- Nope.
- Not me.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.041
I'm in sixth grade.
I don't need a babysitter.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.542
Yeah, scholastically,
you're in sixth grade.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.044
In real life, you're nine.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.754
By the time I was nine,

05:36.837 --> 05:39.423
I had three years' experience
being a full-time nanny.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.383
In fact,
how would you like to make

05:41.467 --> 05:43.344
five bucks an hour
this summer, Liam?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.637
Ten bucks
and one-hour lunch.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.764
Deal.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.390
No, Liam's a minor,
all right?

05:48.474 --> 05:50.309
He's got to have another adult
around to watch Franny.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.895
Better Liam
than some shitty day care

05:52.978 --> 05:54.188
that'll cram her
into a Pack 'n Play

05:54.271 --> 05:55.481
with eight other toddlers.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.108
You love your Uncle Liam,

05:58.192 --> 05:59.526
don't you, girlfriend?

05:59.610 --> 06:01.278
Hey, Carl,
what you got today?

06:01.362 --> 06:03.322
Kelly's coming over later
to help me move.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.406
They can hang out with us,

06:04.490 --> 06:06.325
as long as you guys disappear
when we bone.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.160
- Move? Where you going?
- Leveling up, son.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.162
Liam's got Fiona's room.
Debbie's got Debbie's.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.246
Figure since Ian's
out of the house,

06:11.330 --> 06:12.581
I'll take Frank's room,
let you rock

06:12.664 --> 06:14.333
with the boys' room solo,
if that's cool with you.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.293
Yeah, sure,
sounds good to me.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.419
We can't
not have a bed

06:17.503 --> 06:18.921
for Frank anymore, can we?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.214
- Of course we can.
- Fuck Frank.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.757
Shouldn't we get
Fiona's opinion first?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.093
- No.
- I'm kind of worried about her.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.928
She hasn't responded to any
of my texts or calls.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.554
- Have you guys heard from her?
- Mm-mm.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.182
To stand Ian up
on his last day before prison

06:30.265 --> 06:31.809
and not drive him
when she said she would--

06:31.892 --> 06:32.893
it's not like her.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.020
Uh, it's called
passive-aggression, Debs.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.688
She's still mad at Ian.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.320
Hey, girls are in school.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.780
Coffee's hot.
We're out of milk.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.282
Laundry is clean.
I'm late to open.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.742
How was closing?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.536
Oh, it was fine.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.330
Oh, but I think I forgot
to turn on the dishwasher.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.706
What's all this stuff?

06:54.790 --> 06:56.208
Oh,
that's our old baby stuff.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.418
Purging all those sex toys

06:57.501 --> 06:59.002
made me realize
how much old shit

06:59.086 --> 07:00.504
we still had lying around.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.840
My girl Shawntelle's
coming for it.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.466
Who the hell's Shawntelle?

07:04.550 --> 07:06.510
Shawntelle, the one
who does my locks.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.928
I told you about her.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.888
Six kids,
one has Down syndrome,

07:09.972 --> 07:12.975
no baby daddy,
set of twins on the way?

07:13.058 --> 07:15.144
You're giving away
all our baby stuff?

07:15.227 --> 07:16.645
What, you think
I can get money for it?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.188
No, I don't think
you should be giving away

07:18.272 --> 07:20.858
Gemma's froggy bib
or Amy's Little LambLamb.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.444
Well, I saved
all of their favorite stuff.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.988
Plus, we need to make room
upstairs for the twin beds.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.990
Twin beds?
V, they're not ready for that.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.908
They're tiny little
squishy babies.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.578
They're not, Kev.
They're four years old.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.997
Amy can pick up
her toddler bed and bench it.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.333
Plus, we don't need to be
holding on to old baby shit

07:38.417 --> 07:40.085
when we're done
having babies.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.922
Done having babies?

07:44.715 --> 07:45.966
You said we were gonna

07:46.049 --> 07:47.801
talk about that
down the line.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.929
Sure, we're gonna talk
about it down the line.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.806
Of course we will,
but not

07:52.890 --> 07:54.349
when I'm late to open,
okay?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.809
Okay, let's just say,

07:55.893 --> 07:58.812
upon talking about it
down the line,

07:58.896 --> 08:01.523
we decide to have
loads more babies.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.066
Kev, we don't have room
for all this shit

08:03.150 --> 08:04.651
in this small-ass house.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.528
If you want
to pick out five items

08:06.612 --> 08:08.238
for sentimental reasons, fine,

08:08.322 --> 08:09.865
but the rest
is going to Shawntelle.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.451
Five total or-or-or
five per daughter?

08:12.534 --> 08:13.744
I don't care!

08:25.088 --> 08:27.090
<i>Fiona?</i>

08:27.174 --> 08:28.800
<i>Fiona, are you
in there?</i>

08:28.884 --> 08:31.803
<i>Open up!</i>

08:31.887 --> 08:33.972
Come on.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.849
I'll take your door off!

08:35.933 --> 08:38.560
No, hang on.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.021
I'm coming.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.699
Holy shit.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.993
- It's fine.
- Your face!

08:55.077 --> 08:57.746
- This is not fine, Fiona!
- I'm fine.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.705
I'm fine.

08:58.789 --> 08:59.957
You need stitches.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.124
What happened to you?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.084
It's nothing.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.086
It was a...car accident.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.713
You got into
a car accident?

09:06.797 --> 09:08.465
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

09:08.549 --> 09:09.800
Fiona!

09:11.093 --> 09:13.136
Why didn't you call us?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.764
We had no idea that you were
in a car accident.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.891
We just thought you stood Ian up
because you were pissed.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.936
Oh, my God, Ian.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.396
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, my God.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.022
No, no, no.
Fiona, hey.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.566
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh, shh, shh.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.067
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.153
You can't sleep.
You may have a concussion, okay?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.030
We're gonna get you
to a doctor.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.574
Do you know
where your car is now?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.328
<i>Come in!</i>

09:42.207 --> 09:43.584
Hey, what's up?
Come help me move.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.668
Where?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.336
My new bachelor pad,
where no one'll be.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.005
I'll help you move later.
We're supposed to do

09:48.088 --> 09:50.257
West Point application prep
today, remember?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.467
W-wait, can't we at least
move some furniture?

09:52.551 --> 09:53.885
We'll start
with an ACT practice test,

09:53.969 --> 09:55.762
since you need a minimum score
of 28 on that.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.931
West Point requires you
to have a 3.75 GPA,

09:58.015 --> 09:59.808
and that's including
four years of English,

09:59.891 --> 10:01.518
four years of
college-preparatory mathematics,

10:01.602 --> 10:03.437
including algebra,
geometry, trigonometry--

10:03.520 --> 10:06.106
Uh, yeah, I've waited 17 years
for my own bedroom

10:06.189 --> 10:07.899
that has a door
that locks.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.193
Liam, you'll proctor
for us, won't you?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.113
Franny's napping.
I'm on my union break.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.823
You just have
to hold the stopwatch.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.116
45 minutes for part one,

10:16.199 --> 10:17.242
45 minutes for part two,

10:17.326 --> 10:20.037
and 90 minutes
for part three.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.622
Can we at least move
some furniture first?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.790
We all gotta do things
we don't want to do sometimes,

10:23.874 --> 10:25.208
like the 10K I have to run
right now

10:25.292 --> 10:27.502
to stay Annapolis-strong.

10:27.586 --> 10:28.795
Part one.
Go!

10:32.883 --> 10:35.177
Psst, nerd.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.970
What does this word mean?

10:37.054 --> 10:39.056
"Assessment."
It's a noun.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.434
An evaluation or estimation
of someone's ability.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.728
Oh, fuck me.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.106
So what's the plan here?
You're shaving me?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.650
Just from the chin down.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.109
I am gonna make you

10:51.193 --> 10:54.488
my adorable
little hairless mouse boy.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.491
Unless you'd prefer
rat boy.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.700
I'm gonna go mouse.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.953
- Mm.
- Yeah.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.540
Aw, thanks for riding
this wave with me, Frank.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.293
It is so nice
to have company.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.171
- Freak flags must fly high.
- Mm-hmm.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.049
Besides, there's nothing
you could do to scare me.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.176
I've seen it all,
smoked it all,

11:16.259 --> 11:17.928
and handled it all.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.514
Well, you are a mouse boy
among men.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.850
What would you be doing
right now

11:23.934 --> 11:25.894
if you weren't hanging out
with me?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.813
Um...

11:27.896 --> 11:31.692
I like to keep
my options open, live life.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.568
Oh, that is so healthy.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.613
Twenty-two years of being
a psychotherapist,

11:36.697 --> 11:38.990
I don't think I've ever heard
anything so healthy.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.285
You're a psychotherapist.
Uh...

11:42.369 --> 11:43.912
No disrespect,
but aren't you a little--

11:43.995 --> 11:45.914
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The best of us

11:45.997 --> 11:48.625
have personal experience
with mental illnesses.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.460
That's why we're good
at our jobs.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.504
I mean, even Randy.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.631
He's a psychotherapist,

11:54.715 --> 11:56.633
and he has boundary issues.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.301
That's why he's
in my bathroom right now.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.469
Ingrid...

11:59.553 --> 12:01.304
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

12:01.388 --> 12:03.432
I told you that that key
was for emergencies.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.850
You are now violating
our agreement!

12:04.933 --> 12:06.226
- I-I--
- Violator.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.145
I think this is
an emergency, Ingrid.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.688
I heard tobogganing

12:09.771 --> 12:10.772
at four in the morning.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.232
Now you're blowing off work,

12:12.315 --> 12:13.984
and you're clearly
not taking your meds.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.236
My first patient
isn't until 1 p.m.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.988
Do you not think
that's a little irresponsible

12:18.071 --> 12:20.073
to counsel others when you
have not taken your meds?

12:20.157 --> 12:21.658
Oh, you don't think
it's irresponsible

12:21.742 --> 12:23.577
for you to neglect
your patients

12:23.660 --> 12:26.830
so that you can micromanage
my mental illness?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.165
I'm Frank, by the way.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.541
Stay out of this, Frank.
You have no idea

12:29.624 --> 12:30.667
what you're
getting yourself into.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.378
Hey, this has a cycle,
see?

12:33.462 --> 12:34.755
Super fun at the beginning.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.965
Stay up all night.
It's great.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.842
But by tonight,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.510
things will be very rough.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.307
Ingy, Ingy, honey,

12:45.390 --> 12:46.600
you just got out
of the psych ward, sweetie.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.809
You need your medications.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.853
I am missing my life, Randy.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.480
I am missing it!

12:51.563 --> 12:52.856
And besides,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.191
Frank loves me

12:54.274 --> 12:55.776
just as I am.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.152
- I do.
- He does.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.864
You can find your way out...
R-Randall?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.033
It's Randy.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.326
Randy.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.248
Give it up.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.257
Here you go.
RAV4, right?

13:19.341 --> 13:20.759
Oh, my God.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.469
This car is totaled!

13:22.552 --> 13:23.929
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.848
Insurance will cover
a hit-and-run.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.308
Y-you have insurance, right?

13:29.893 --> 13:31.686
Did you call
the police?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.855
Did you file
an accident report?

13:33.939 --> 13:35.941
You gotta find
whoever did this, Fiona.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.487
I did it.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.030
You did what?

13:43.949 --> 13:46.451
I did this.
I was...

13:47.786 --> 13:49.246
drunk, and I didn't call
the police

13:49.329 --> 13:51.248
'cause I was drunk.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.542
You were driving drunk?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.836
The hell is going on with you?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.713
It's adult shit, okay?

13:58.797 --> 13:59.798
Fuck that.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.675
I'm not a kid.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.844
I have a kid.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.389
All right, fine.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.850
Uh...

14:09.933 --> 14:11.852
the zoning fell through

14:11.935 --> 14:13.311
on my old-age home yesterday,

14:13.395 --> 14:16.398
which means I got Max Whitford
stalking me

14:16.481 --> 14:18.483
for $25K,

14:18.567 --> 14:22.571
or else I lose my entire
$100K investment,

14:22.654 --> 14:24.614
which fucks me, 'cause...

14:24.698 --> 14:27.117
without an immediate profit
off that,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.744
I actually cannot afford

14:29.828 --> 14:33.707
my first and second mortgages
on my apartment building,

14:34.708 --> 14:36.585
and that means
I'm gonna have to sell

14:36.668 --> 14:38.295
my building.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.592
Also, it turns out
that Ford's married.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.886
Yeah.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.013
I found that out right before
I totaled this car,

14:48.096 --> 14:51.224
which is gonna cost
thousands to fix.

14:51.308 --> 14:56.021
So that on top
of the $1,800 that...

14:56.646 --> 14:59.691
I just spent at the ER
and the $500

14:59.774 --> 15:02.360
that this tow place
just charged me

15:02.444 --> 15:04.154
means I'm so far up
shit's creek,

15:04.237 --> 15:05.822
I don't even have lunch money.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.038
And I'm such a fucking
piece of shit

15:13.121 --> 15:16.166
that I forgot my own brother
was going to prison.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.128
So what you're saying is,

15:20.211 --> 15:21.838
you've had
a shitty couple days.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.844
Yeah, I know, right?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.721
It's gonna be okay, Fiona.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.141
It's gonna be okay.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.353
Yeah?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.313
You got a spare...

15:38.396 --> 15:41.274
$25K lying around?

15:41.358 --> 15:42.817
No.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.028
But I got a friend
who might be able

15:45.111 --> 15:46.738
to help us out
with the car, at least.

Aw!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.762
Talk-a-bear?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.307
That monster threw out
Talk-a-bear.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.769
<i>Hi, Amy and Gemma.</i>

16:17.852 --> 16:19.270
<i>This is Daddy,
and we're talking</i>

16:19.354 --> 16:20.355
<i>into our Talk-a-bear.</i>

16:22.315 --> 16:24.067
<i>Can you say "Daddy"?</i>

16:24.150 --> 16:25.652
<i>- "Daddy."
- Doggy.</i>

16:25.735 --> 16:27.654
<i>That's "doggy."
Woof, woof.</i>

16:27.737 --> 16:29.364
<i>Dada.</i>

16:35.704 --> 16:37.122
Yeah, who is it?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.290
<i>V's friend Shawntelle.</i>

16:39.374 --> 16:41.042
<i>You must be Kevin.</i>

16:41.126 --> 16:43.211
Nope, wrong house.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.339
<i>Well, is 2113 North Wallace,
ain't it?</i>

16:46.423 --> 16:48.675
<i>No parlez anglais!</i>

16:48.758 --> 16:51.594
- Go away!
<i>- V told me she had some cribs</i>

16:51.678 --> 16:53.888
<i>and six bags
of baby stuff for me.</i>

16:53.972 --> 16:55.807
<i>I borrowed a truck.</i>

17:02.022 --> 17:03.940
V and Kevin are dead!

17:04.024 --> 17:05.442
<i>What?</i>

17:05.525 --> 17:06.860
That's right!

17:06.943 --> 17:08.987
I murdered them!

17:10.238 --> 17:12.282
Yeah, there's blood everywhere.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.826
And you're next, Shawntelle.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.995
Ruh-rar-ar-ar-ar-ar!

17:17.078 --> 17:19.205
Yeah, that's a chain saw!

17:27.464 --> 17:29.340
Whoa.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.301
Look at this!

17:33.094 --> 17:36.514
This is...impressive.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.559
Oh, look at you.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.020
You sexy librarian, you.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.646
You think these are hot,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.024
wait till I put on
my sexy

17:46.107 --> 17:47.817
therapist blazer

17:47.901 --> 17:51.279
and use Randy's
prescription pad

17:51.362 --> 17:55.200
to write you 200 milligrams
of Wellbutrin.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.118
Excellent.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.412
Excellent.
How long's this gonna take?

17:59.496 --> 18:01.623
Uh, I got three patients.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.125
- Fifty minutes a session.
- Jesus.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.461
People have 50 minutes
of shit to whine about?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.171
You know, there's a Starbucks
right on the corner.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.006
Why don't you just go ahead
and hang out there

18:10.090 --> 18:11.591
- for three hours or something?
- No, I don't want to be

18:11.674 --> 18:13.968
away from you that long.
Can't I hide here and watch?

18:14.052 --> 18:15.220
Oh, no.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.597
No, no, you-you won't even
know I'm here.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.974
I will be quiet

18:20.058 --> 18:21.976
as a hairless mouse.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.272
Oof.
Yikes.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.900
So what do you think?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.568
Can you hook us up, Farhad?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.039
What'd he say?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.041
He's gonna strip it,
give you 600 bucks for parts,

18:45.125 --> 18:46.543
and then we'll dump it
in the weeds

18:46.626 --> 18:49.003
behind that empty lot
off 16 and Michigan.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.339
Take the cops, like, a week
to find it back there.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.007
And then you just contact
your insurance company,

18:53.091 --> 18:55.510
tell them it was stolen,
and they'll pay off your lease.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.511
Really?

18:56.594 --> 18:57.887
Yeah, we do it all the time.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.765
Issa! Abdul!

19:05.770 --> 19:07.272
All right, go.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.774
Go do whatever
you're gonna do today.

19:09.858 --> 19:10.859
You sure?

19:10.942 --> 19:12.485
Yeah, I'm just gonna

19:12.569 --> 19:14.154
be here...

19:14.237 --> 19:16.573
...being a felon.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.372
- Maybe I should hang out.
- Nah, go.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.542
I'm gonna get
my 600 bucks,

19:27.625 --> 19:30.128
head over to Patsy's,
list my building online.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.797
Go. You got
better shit to do today.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.300
Okay.
I'll see you later.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.386
Hey, Farhad,
what are you doing today?

19:38.469 --> 19:39.888
- Pretty busy, actually, with--
- No, you're not.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.764
I'll be back for you
in three hours.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.607
Why are you
at your desk this week,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.609
Dr. Jones?
You're always in your chair.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.068
Yeah.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.237
It seems to bother you
that I'm not in my chair.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.618
Let's, um...
let's talk about that. Why?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.329
It's just, I don't like
when things change suddenly.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.247
Ah,
because of your mother.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.958
Yes.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.753
Yeah.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.588
Yeah, she's
the reason that I have

20:13.671 --> 20:15.882
body dysmorphia
and can't get out of bed.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.967
Oh.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.427
Do you know she even
lords it over me

20:19.510 --> 20:21.179
that she pays
for this therapy...

20:21.262 --> 20:22.931
...at $275 an hour?

20:23.014 --> 20:25.433
Mm.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.352
Um,

20:27.435 --> 20:30.188
let's just talk some more
about that body dysmorphia.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.607
Tell me about that.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.443
Well, it's my head.
It is...

20:35.526 --> 20:37.445
disproportionately large.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.322
Yes!

20:39.405 --> 20:41.074
Um...

20:41.157 --> 20:43.243
Jesus Christ,
did I get any right?

20:43.326 --> 20:44.410
You know what?

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Who cares about scores?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.871
This is just a tool to see

20:46.955 --> 20:49.123
where your strengths
and your weaknesses lie.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.167
But what was
my score, though?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.670
Think you got a couple
of them right--maybe.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.921
You know,
it doesn't matter.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.214
Now we know
that we need to brush up

20:56.297 --> 20:58.216
on comp lit,
algebra, geometry,

20:58.299 --> 20:59.759
trigonometry, U.S. history,
government,

20:59.842 --> 21:01.052
and reading comprehension.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.387
Well, that's, like,
all the subjects.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.597
Liam will help us.
Won't you, Liam?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.015
Let's start with
the <i>Bob</i> books.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.685
"Bob has a dog.
Pat likes cats."

21:08.768 --> 21:10.186
I love those books.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.105
He's not kidding.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.733
So Fiona didn't blow Ian off
because she was pissed at him.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.193
She got into
a fucking car accident.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.611
That's why she didn't show!

21:18.695 --> 21:21.322
- Wait, is she okay?
- No, it's really bad.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.824
She totaled her car,

21:22.907 --> 21:23.908
and she broke her wrist,

21:23.992 --> 21:25.159
she's nonstop ugly-crying,

21:25.243 --> 21:27.287
and I've never
seen her this bad before.

21:27.370 --> 21:30.164
And wait, Ford is married
and has a whole other family

21:30.248 --> 21:31.374
and life and a bunch
of kids in Chicago.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.001
- Wait, wait, wait, what?
- Motherfucker!

21:33.084 --> 21:34.502
And now Fiona has to sell
her building today

21:34.585 --> 21:35.753
because she doesn't have money
for lunch.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.422
Okay, Debs,
where is she now?

21:37.505 --> 21:38.715
I don't know.
We were dealing with the car.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.133
She said she could handle it.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.342
What, and you left her?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.719
What was I supposed to do?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.053
She said she's fine.
She's going to Patsy's.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.263
All right, fine.
You tag out.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.472
I'm gonna go find Fiona,
all right?

21:46.556 --> 21:48.474
And I'll handle Ford.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.396
Oh, God.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.398
That was so hot.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.151
Okay, now it's your turn.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.320
- I'm gonna get under the desk.
- What?

22:00.403 --> 22:03.281
Yeah, yeah, just tell
my next patient I'm out sick.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.907
It's not hard.
It's not hard.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.660
All you're gonna do
is listen and nod.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.953
Now, if you get in a jam,

22:09.037 --> 22:10.413
you just repeat back
what they said

22:10.496 --> 22:11.873
in an empathetic tone.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.839
Shit.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.674
Debbie told you?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.301
Yeah, course she told me.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.345
- Fuck, you okay?
- I'm fine.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.763
Debbie thinks
you're gonna kill yourself.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.931
I'm fine.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.600
You know, nine stitches,

22:30.683 --> 22:32.268
no concussion,

22:33.061 --> 22:34.896
wrist'll take eight weeks,

22:34.979 --> 22:37.023
but I'll be fine.

22:38.983 --> 22:39.984
Why are you in a suit?

22:40.068 --> 22:42.862
Oh, Brad's baby's
getting christened.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.990
But, you know,
I can skip it.

22:46.074 --> 22:46.991
You know,
let's figure this out.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.034
I mean, how deep
are you in the hole?

22:48.117 --> 22:50.578
No need.
I listed my building.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.289
There's gonna be
an open house at 1 p.m.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.916
You don't have to do that,
though.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.167
I want to sell it.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.130
Give me that.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.057
So how was Ian

23:11.140 --> 23:12.934
when you dropped him off
at prison?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.060
Was he upset?

23:14.143 --> 23:16.604
No.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.731
No, he was okay.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.692
You know, he stayed strong.
Yeah.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.987
I'm gonna get up there
first visiting hours I can.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.948
You got a hell
of a good excuse.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.282
All right?
He'll be cool.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.300
Debbie.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.885
Who's he?

23:47.969 --> 23:48.970
Farhad.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.597
What's going on?

23:51.681 --> 23:53.516
Nothing.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.102
I just have this giant prick
of an asshole

23:56.185 --> 23:57.437
who I'm gonna torture today.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.813
Committed a crime
against womanhood

23:58.896 --> 24:01.107
way worse than any
of those misogynistic assholes

24:01.190 --> 24:02.942
we hit with welded dicks.

24:03.025 --> 24:06.028
I mean, this guy deserves
the fucking works.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.613
Was wondering if you wanted
to join us,

24:07.697 --> 24:08.948
for old times' sake?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.243
What kind of torture
we talking?

24:12.326 --> 24:14.829
True, brutal,
and unrelenting.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.914
- Can we use power tools?
- Hmm!

24:25.006 --> 24:26.632
What do you think?
Should we start?

24:26.716 --> 24:28.009
Y-yes.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.344
So sorry, Father.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.429
Brad, Camille...

24:31.512 --> 24:33.097
Thanks
for inviting me today.

24:33.181 --> 24:35.308
Yeah. Yeah, man.
Worst thing you can do

24:35.391 --> 24:37.185
when you're having
a tough time is be alone.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.978
...responsibility
for his training--

24:40.813 --> 24:42.982
Fuck me, that door is heavy.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.401
Shit.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.486
Hey!

24:46.569 --> 24:47.945
'Sup, Denis?

24:48.029 --> 24:49.113
Oh, yas, queen.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.782
Aunt Gayle,
looking good, sister!

24:51.866 --> 24:53.075
You know her?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.619
No, we, um,

24:54.702 --> 24:57.580
hung out at Brad's wedding
and we...fucked

24:57.663 --> 24:59.749
- badly.
- Oh, shit.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.959
Really, Tami?
Twenty minutes late.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.503
Slow your roll, okay?

25:03.586 --> 25:05.880
- There was no parking.
- You're the godmother.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.965
We were about to get
my cousin Jennifer to fill in.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.050
Well, I'm here now.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.468
Let's do this.
Hi.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.387
Okay, sorry, Father.
Please continue.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.265
Uh, Brad, Camille,

25:16.349 --> 25:18.851
you have asked to have
your child baptized.

25:18.935 --> 25:21.145
It will be
your responsibility--

25:21.229 --> 25:22.480
Oh, shit.
Wait.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.565
You guys invited Jabby?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.778
<i>♪♪ You got that pressure... ♪♪</i>

26:10.861 --> 26:12.697
And if we put
a six-foot platform here,

26:12.780 --> 26:14.073
so many people would see it--

26:14.156 --> 26:15.324
the foot traffic alone.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.743
A six-foot platform?

26:17.827 --> 26:18.869
That's too much effort.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.705
Can't we just castrate him
with Farhad's goat knife?

26:20.788 --> 26:22.540
Or stone him.
In Islam, we bury

26:22.623 --> 26:24.083
adulterers in the earth
with their heads sticking out,

26:24.166 --> 26:26.335
- and then we stone them.
- No.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.462
We really gotta
make this one hurt.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.381
Gotta humiliate
this motherfucker.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.632
We can do this.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.468
We are three skilled laborers!

26:34.552 --> 26:36.053
Hands in!

26:36.137 --> 26:37.013
- Go, team!
- Go, team.

26:37.096 --> 26:37.847
Okay.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.806
Go, team.

26:38.889 --> 26:39.890
Yes.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.729
Name the three branches
of government.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.064
Pentagon, DMV, cops.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.316
Who was the first
American president?

26:48.399 --> 26:50.026
Easy.
Lincoln.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.485
Who coined the term
"domino effect"

26:51.569 --> 26:53.487
to describe the spread
of communism?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.824
Oh, Rovey Wade?

26:56.907 --> 26:58.701
Hey, yo, Gallaghers,

26:58.784 --> 27:00.494
how you doing?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.580
And person
I've never seen before.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.833
I'm gonna stash some shit
in your basement for a while.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.126
It's a secret

27:07.209 --> 27:08.919
from V, so...

27:09.003 --> 27:10.713
- don't tell V, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

27:10.796 --> 27:11.922
Why are you saving
baby stuff, though?

27:12.006 --> 27:13.215
Aren't the girls,
like, four now?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.968
You shut your mouth, Carl.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.511
Next question.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.055
Who was the first
American president

27:19.138 --> 27:20.806
to serve
two nonconsecutive terms?

27:20.890 --> 27:22.350
Oh, fuck if I know.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.601
Grover Cleveland.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.478
Oh, from <i>Sesame Street?</i>

27:26.646 --> 27:27.647
Oh, my God.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.398
I don't understand.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.526
Dr. Jones is just out sick?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.862
Therapists can't do that.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.573
Why not?
They get sick, just like us.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.033
Okay, go ahead.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.993
Uh, what's your problem?
Tell me quickly.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.579
Sor--s-somewhat quickly.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.291
Not a great week
this week.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.251
I couldn't get out of bed
yesterday

27:49.335 --> 27:50.544
- because I kept thinking--
- Jesus, you too?

27:50.628 --> 27:52.213
What is it with you people?

27:52.296 --> 27:55.174
Get the fuck out of bed.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.262
Well, my ex,
Jeremy,

28:00.346 --> 28:03.140
keeps calling me
and calling me and calling me,

28:03.224 --> 28:04.725
and I'm trying
to have boundaries,

28:04.809 --> 28:07.645
but I also want him to call,
which I recognize is crazy.

28:07.728 --> 28:08.938
I just don't know
what to do.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.065
Okay, slow down.
That's--that's too fast.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.983
Uh, um,

28:13.067 --> 28:16.612
okay, first of all...
Jazmin, you're not crazy.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.406
There are crazy people
out there.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.490
Um...

28:19.573 --> 28:21.867
I have bipolar depression.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.078
Ah, that's good.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.162
That's good.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.372
Bipolar, yes.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.290
?
Uh..."bi,

28:28.374 --> 28:31.001
from the Latin
meaning "two,"

28:31.085 --> 28:33.963
meaning half the time,
you're kind of interesting,

28:34.046 --> 28:36.006
and the other half, you're not
very interesting at all.

28:36.090 --> 28:38.050
Right now, talking
about your ex-boyfriend,

28:38.134 --> 28:40.052
you-you're not
very interesting.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.181
Give me your phone.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.981
God.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.108
- Does that feel good or what?
- No!

28:54.191 --> 28:55.234
That was the new iPhone--

28:55.317 --> 28:56.652
NYP.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.404
That's it.
Not your problem.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.073
Get a new phone number
so he can't call you anymore.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.825
Get a more flattering haircut.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.869
Stop walking around
like a sorry sack of shit.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.370
End this now.

29:06.454 --> 29:07.621
You gotta finish it.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.583
- NYP.
- Finish it now.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.960
Not my problem.

29:13.753 --> 29:14.754
Wow.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.548
Thank you, Doctor.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.388
What the hell,

29:24.472 --> 29:26.140
Gallagher?
Is your phone broken?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.976
Holy shit.
What happened to your face?

29:29.059 --> 29:31.479
I'm fine.
Just a little hit-and-run.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.564
God, that looks...

29:33.647 --> 29:34.940
terrible.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.442
Like, my brain
is rejecting

29:36.525 --> 29:38.903
that an otherwise very hot girl
can look this bad.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.571
Anyway, I'm late
for my spin class,

29:40.654 --> 29:43.491
and your PayPal
didn't come through, girl.

29:43.574 --> 29:44.575
Yeah, I--

29:44.658 --> 29:46.994
Tacky to make me
come find you.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.412
Selling this place?

29:48.496 --> 29:50.206
Yeah, sorry.
I've just been swamped,

29:50.289 --> 29:52.082
and I was in the hospital
most of the day yesterday--

29:52.166 --> 29:53.250
Totally get it.
No bigs.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.461
Just PayPal me right now.

29:55.544 --> 29:59.507
I'm @maxwhitfordsaysyas.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.509
Y-A-S.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.969
Do you not have the app?

30:05.638 --> 30:07.723
I don't have the $25K.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.185
You don't have $25K?

30:11.268 --> 30:14.522
Who doesn't have $25K?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.440
- Me?
- All right,

30:16.524 --> 30:18.067
so borrow it
against your portfolio.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.485
Call your guy.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.655
I don't have a guy,
Max,

30:22.738 --> 30:23.989
and I got rejected
for a loan.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.366
I got nothing.

30:25.449 --> 30:28.035
What about your other properties
and investments?

30:28.118 --> 30:29.912
Anything liquid
you can unload?

30:32.373 --> 30:33.457
Oh.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.708
Oh, you overleveraged?

30:38.796 --> 30:39.964
You told everybody
you could swim,

30:40.047 --> 30:41.423
and now you're drowning?

30:43.050 --> 30:46.554
Yeah, going down
like the fucking <i>Titanic.</i>

30:46.637 --> 30:48.264
Oh.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.934
You got anybody
you can call?

30:52.017 --> 30:54.061
Uncle, mom, something?

30:54.812 --> 30:57.648
Nobody in my life
has that kind of money.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.567
That's why I'm selling
this place.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.238
Even if I could,

31:04.321 --> 31:06.115
you just--you're not
gonna clear 25 large

31:06.198 --> 31:07.616
in a couple days.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.243
Come on,

31:09.326 --> 31:12.621
buyer will need to do
due diligence and inspections

31:12.705 --> 31:14.748
and probably try to back out
at the end of escrow,

31:14.832 --> 31:17.084
try to fuck you with
a lowball offer last-minute.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.627
I mean, you're not
gonna have cash in hand

31:18.711 --> 31:20.838
for at least 90 days.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.216
Who's your listing agent?

31:25.718 --> 31:27.386
I can't afford you, Max.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.221
Maybe I waive
my commission for you.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.892
You'd do that?

31:32.975 --> 31:34.852
Yeah.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.980
I am not as big an asshole
as you think I am.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.815
Come on.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.234
Pour me some warm chard

31:42.318 --> 31:43.986
and roll out the tour.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.446
I might have a couple
possible buyers

31:45.529 --> 31:47.072
interested in a quick sale.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.659
Okay.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.537
My new chosen career.
You never can tell.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.164
I know. I think you might
be really good at it.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.415
You headed over
to First Monday?

31:56.498 --> 31:58.375
Jesus Christ, Randy!

31:58.459 --> 32:00.544
We're gonna have
to put a cowbell on you.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.963
Ingy, First Monday.
You haven't forgotten, have you?

32:03.047 --> 32:04.924
No, no, we have not
forgotten First Monday.

32:05.007 --> 32:07.760
We're gonna definitely
be there--Frank and I.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.554
Bet your ass we're gonna
be at...First Monday.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.972
Good.
We'll see you there.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.974
First what?

32:14.058 --> 32:15.726
Oh, all the therapists
in this building

32:15.809 --> 32:17.853
get together on the first
Monday of every month.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.271
- Mm.
- It's usually, uh,

32:19.355 --> 32:21.315
somebody's birthday or...

32:21.398 --> 32:23.025
You know, it'll be quick.
We'll just make an appearance.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.986
Motherfucker!

32:26.070 --> 32:27.404
What? What happ--what?

32:27.488 --> 32:29.406
Are you all right?

32:29.490 --> 32:30.950
Yeah, lock got stuck.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.077
I just got frustrated.
You ready?

32:35.996 --> 32:38.123
Jabby!

32:38.207 --> 32:39.208
Hey!

32:39.291 --> 32:40.334
I was hoping you'd be here.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.585
I've been having a lot

32:41.669 --> 32:43.045
of really great sex recently.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.421
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go bang one out,

32:44.505 --> 32:46.382
get my average back in
the shitter, where it belongs.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.008
Yeah, you know, I could use
some fresh puke on my shoes,

32:48.092 --> 32:49.718
so that'll be good.

32:49.802 --> 32:50.886
Who's this guy?

32:51.345 --> 32:52.471
Jason, this is Tami.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.598
Tami, this is
my friend Jason.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.016
Lip's my sponsor.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.685
Sponsor?

32:57.768 --> 32:59.311
At, uh, AA.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.063
Alcoholics Anonymous.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.815
So you're at this sober?

33:02.898 --> 33:05.401
Yeah.
It's nice, right?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.485
It's good juice.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.070
I mixed apple and cran.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.989
What, do you
collect weird sidekicks?

33:10.072 --> 33:12.574
What happened to the last one,
that little girl with the Afro?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.368
- Her mother took her back.
- Hmm.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.161
Yeah, running theme today.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.621
Lost my baby too.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.125
All right.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.544
Okay.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.587
Any of you kids
wanna do something fun

33:25.671 --> 33:27.006
with your Auntie Tami?

33:27.089 --> 33:28.716
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.427
Okay, well, who's never
smoked a cigarette before?

33:31.510 --> 33:33.178
- Me!
- Oh, you haven't?

33:33.262 --> 33:34.430
Okay, well,
the first one's the hardest,

33:34.513 --> 33:35.973
but you guys are gonna
be great. Come on.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.809
Follow me.
Follow your Auntie Tami.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.980
Well, if you had the time,

33:43.063 --> 33:45.190
you could probably
get $425K for it.

33:45.274 --> 33:46.608
That's what I was thinking.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.862
But it would cost you
$40K in closing costs,

33:49.945 --> 33:51.905
plus 120-day escrow,

33:51.989 --> 33:54.324
and you don't have
that kind of time.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.453
How much is your mortgage?

33:57.536 --> 33:58.537
I've got two.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.830
One is--

33:59.913 --> 34:02.124
What's the total?

34:02.207 --> 34:04.293
$292,000.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.296
All right.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.590
I'll give you $292,000 for it.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.677
- Wait, you want to buy it?
- Yeah.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.597
I'll take it off your hands
today, in cash, as is,

34:16.680 --> 34:19.016
no inspections,
close in 30 days.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.268
Could pay off your mortgages
and walk away.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.354
And I'll take care
of the $25K

34:24.438 --> 34:27.941
you owe the partnership
so you don't default, but...

34:28.025 --> 34:29.860
I'm gonna charge you interest
on that.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.529
But that-that'll leave me
with nothing, Max.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.784
It'll leave you
with your credit intact,

34:36.867 --> 34:39.536
and you didn't
get foreclosed on.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.999
You're pretty,
but I'm not a charity.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.221
<i>♪♪ Baby, I just flew in ♪♪</i>

34:57.304 --> 34:59.306
<i>♪♪ Tell me what
you're doing... ♪♪</i>

35:01.433 --> 35:03.852
Wow.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.271
What's all this?

35:06.980 --> 35:09.525
I just love and appreciate
my beautiful wife,

35:09.608 --> 35:11.819
the mother
to my wonderful children,

35:11.902 --> 35:13.612
and I thought
you might like some food

35:13.695 --> 35:15.614
that's slightly...

35:15.697 --> 35:17.324
aphrodisiac-y.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.744
Did you cheat on me?

35:20.828 --> 35:21.829
No.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.872
But I did get you a gift.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.046
I like the shape of the box.
Jewelry?

35:31.588 --> 35:32.756
Better.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.885
For our future baby.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.387
Our what now?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.264
We should have
another baby, V.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.640
We always talk,
we're gonna have

35:41.723 --> 35:43.308
this conversation
down the line,

35:43.392 --> 35:45.227
and down the line
is today.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.479
I want another baby.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.823
Yay.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.702
Hooray?
Say something.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.704
So much to say.

36:06.039 --> 36:09.084
No. Hell no.
Over my dead damn body.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.544
You think I'm fucking
getting pregnant again?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.045
You said that we
were gonna have

36:12.129 --> 36:13.964
this conversation
down the line.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.841
That's what women say
when they mean no.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.176
Down the line, no.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.012
But babies, V.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.348
Baby tushies
and-and-and-and baby toesies,

36:23.432 --> 36:27.019
baby mullets
and baby fat rolls.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.146
You honestly
don't feel anything

36:29.229 --> 36:30.772
when you look at this?

36:30.856 --> 36:33.108
I feel grateful
for our two beautiful girls

36:33.192 --> 36:34.276
that we can't put in day care

36:34.359 --> 36:36.028
without committing
identity fraud

36:36.111 --> 36:37.821
and making them be
the same damn person.

36:37.905 --> 36:41.033
We're too broke
to have more kids.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.367
Yes, yes, okay,

36:42.451 --> 36:43.952
but look.

36:44.036 --> 36:47.664
I will do everything.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.752
You just have to be
inconvenienced for nine months.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.337
Inconvenienced?

36:53.420 --> 36:56.632
No, Kev.
N to the fucking O.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.979
So how long has she
been awake, Frank?

37:11.063 --> 37:13.565
Thirty-six, 38 hours.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.276
There's a woman
wearing plastic bags,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.612
and no one's talking
about it.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.864
It's gonna get really bad
really soon--

37:20.948 --> 37:22.115
you know, her symptoms.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.409
I can handle
the symptoms, Randy.

37:24.493 --> 37:27.079
Listen, no.
Not like this, Frank.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.331
Manic adulations,

37:29.414 --> 37:31.792
violent delusions, insomnia.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.629
Self-harm.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.214
You won't understand
her diagnosis,

37:37.297 --> 37:38.632
but in layman's terms,

37:38.715 --> 37:41.260
she's batshit crazy.
Look at this.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.304
She's stabbed me 14 times
over the years.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.474
Every time,
she was off her meds.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.519
The switch will go off soon,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.437
and when it does,
you won't know what hit you.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.731
Thank you for the FYI,

37:54.815 --> 37:56.400
but I'm a pro.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.404
Well, I wouldn't let myself
fall asleep if I were you.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.499
Be safe, all right?

38:17.671 --> 38:20.340
Your super-sad friend
had to go, Jabby?

38:20.424 --> 38:23.010
Yeah, he's, uh,
headed off to a meeting.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.636
Come smoke with me.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.475
There you go.

38:30.559 --> 38:31.768
Thanks.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.240
My family is a lot.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.743
I can't believe
you're here voluntarily.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.036
Ah, you want to see a lot?

38:49.119 --> 38:51.079
Swing by the Gallagher
house sometime.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.668
So last time I saw you,

38:56.752 --> 38:58.962
you asked me to dinner.
That offer still good?

39:00.714 --> 39:02.132
What, you want
to go on a date now?

39:02.883 --> 39:03.884
Guess so.

39:03.967 --> 39:06.136
Fuck me. I mean,
I must be really hard up.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.806
Come on.
I know a great place, loser.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.725
You're driving.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.303
Come on, Rusty.
Let's roll.

39:53.517 --> 39:54.601
Come on.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.279
Come on, Rusty.
Let's go.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.117
What's the matter?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.333
You don't wanna leave?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.862
Ingy?

40:46.945 --> 40:48.405
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

40:48.488 --> 40:50.657
I fell asleep.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.330
Hey.

40:57.414 --> 40:58.915
- What's up?
- Hey.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.877
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.712
I'm just, um,
reorganizing my books

41:03.795 --> 41:05.255
by years of publication

41:05.338 --> 41:07.466
whi-whi-while learning
Italian.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.055
Neat.
I-I heard a, uh--

41:14.139 --> 41:15.849
a big crash in here.
Did something break?

41:15.932 --> 41:17.434
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No?

41:17.517 --> 41:19.769
No, I, uh--
I made a snack over there,

41:19.853 --> 41:22.355
if-if that's to which
you are referring.

41:23.690 --> 41:24.733
Uh...

41:25.192 --> 41:27.402
maybe it's time for us
to get some shuteye.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.487
Oh, no, no, no, no.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.280
I c--I can't abandon
my project.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.698
That is a fool's game.

41:31.781 --> 41:34.075
Winners finish projects.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.660
Honey, do you feel all right?

41:35.744 --> 41:38.163
You know, I made
a savory snack.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.208
A nice big piece of Brie
with some crackers.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.751
You want some?

41:43.335 --> 41:46.213
Uh, I'm okay,
but thanks.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.343
<i>continues
speaking Italian</i>

41:51.426 --> 41:52.928
Eat the Brie.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.516
So one older,
two younger.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.142
I'm the almost-middle.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.228
Someone's got to be
the problem child, right?

42:01.311 --> 42:02.979
Are you that one
in your family?

42:03.063 --> 42:05.732
All Gallaghers
are problem children.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.527
This is spicy as hell.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.654
I told you.
Arturo knows what's up.

42:10.737 --> 42:11.738
Yeah.

42:13.365 --> 42:15.283
Anyway,

42:15.367 --> 42:16.910
that's what I like
about doing hair.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.120
You can change it.
Grows back.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.914
Hair is never
the problem child.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.251
You got a job?

42:24.334 --> 42:26.044
Yeah, I, uh, fix bikes.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.254
You know, over at Born Free.

42:27.337 --> 42:29.631
- Mm, that's right, with Brad.
- Yeah.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.841
You know I totally thought
he was gay when I first met him?

42:31.925 --> 42:33.760
Actually, I did too.

42:33.843 --> 42:34.844
Mm.

42:36.555 --> 42:39.516
B-T-dubs,
all the women in my family

42:39.599 --> 42:41.893
die of ovarian cancer
by the time they're 50,

42:41.977 --> 42:44.104
so I'm only on this Earth
for another 25 years or so.

42:44.187 --> 42:45.355
Oh.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.899
That's a pretty intense
first date factoid.

42:47.983 --> 42:50.402
Well, gotta take life
by the balls.

42:50.485 --> 42:51.570
I agree.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.450
Want to try
and fuck me properly this time?

42:57.534 --> 42:59.494
- What, like now?
- Yeah.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.373
Yeah.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.346
Ugh.

43:26.187 --> 43:27.564
Mm.

43:27.647 --> 43:28.648
Cheers.

43:56.968 --> 43:57.969
We did it.

43:58.053 --> 43:59.054
Crushed it.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.555
Such craftsmanship.

44:00.639 --> 44:02.182
Shall we add
the cherry on top?

44:02.265 --> 44:04.017
- Oh, yeah.
- Got the Taser right here.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.685
I got the pulley.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.737
Fucking A.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.073
Let's roll.

44:18.156 --> 44:19.991
So there's a loophole
for West Point.

44:20.075 --> 44:21.451
It's there
in the fine print.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.036
If your academics
are not up to snuff,

44:23.119 --> 44:24.287
you can submit
a personal statement

44:24.371 --> 44:25.455
explaining that
you've had hardships

44:25.538 --> 44:27.290
in the classroom
or at home.

44:27.374 --> 44:28.375
Kelly, I'm tired.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.001
Okay, what's been difficult
about your life?

44:30.085 --> 44:32.045
Just ballpark.

44:32.128 --> 44:34.756
Was growing up
on the South Side rough?

44:34.839 --> 44:35.882
No, it's awesome here.

44:35.965 --> 44:38.593
Come on, Carl, try.
I want you to get in.

44:38.677 --> 44:39.678
- Why?
- Because I want my boyfriend

44:39.761 --> 44:41.262
to be West Point, Cadet.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.681
Wait, I'm your boyfriend?

44:43.973 --> 44:45.475
Gross.

44:45.558 --> 44:47.185
Yes.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.480
So this is called the Adverse
Childhood Experience Study.

44:50.563 --> 44:51.940
All you have to do
is answer yes or no,

44:52.023 --> 44:53.400
and you get a point
for every fucked-up thing

44:53.483 --> 44:55.026
that you've lived through.

44:55.110 --> 44:56.695
Okay.

44:56.778 --> 44:58.113
Before your 18th birthday,

44:58.196 --> 44:59.781
did a parent or other adult
in the household

44:59.864 --> 45:03.201
often or very often
swear at you, insult you,

45:03.284 --> 45:06.079
put you down,
or humiliate you?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.163
Yes.

45:07.247 --> 45:08.331
Oh, which one?

45:08.415 --> 45:09.416
All four.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.501
That's four points, Carl.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.628
Finally, a test
he does well on.

45:14.587 --> 45:15.880
Uh, before
your 18th birthday,

45:15.964 --> 45:17.841
did you live with anyone
who was a problem drinker,

45:17.924 --> 45:20.093
alcoholic,
or used street drugs?

45:20.176 --> 45:22.387
Yes.
Also, I abused

45:22.470 --> 45:24.472
and sold street drugs myself.

45:25.265 --> 45:26.391
Wow.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.560
Okay, great.
That's two points.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.103
Uh, before your 18th birthday,

45:30.186 --> 45:32.605
was a biological parent
ever lost to you

45:32.689 --> 45:35.442
through divorce,
abandonment, or death?

45:35.525 --> 45:36.860
Yeah, all three.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.780
Carl, you've had
tremendous hardships!

45:40.864 --> 45:43.408
We-we can write the shit
out of this personal essay!

45:43.491 --> 45:45.493
They're gonna beg you
to go to West Point.

45:45.577 --> 45:48.163
Oh, and I also microwaved
a bunny once too.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.165
Excellent.

45:57.797 --> 45:59.340
Almo--

45:59.424 --> 46:02.844
V...ah!

46:17.192 --> 46:18.610
So?

46:23.406 --> 46:24.407
Eh.

46:25.867 --> 46:28.119
"Eh"?

46:28.203 --> 46:29.788
Like, a...

46:29.871 --> 46:31.998
- six out of ten.
- What?

46:32.832 --> 46:34.834
I-I need a breakdown
of that scorecard.

46:34.918 --> 46:37.170
I mean, where-where
did I lose points on this?

46:37.253 --> 46:39.923
Well, it wasn't jabby,

46:40.006 --> 46:43.259
per se, but it was
fairly thrust-y.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.845
- What?
- Thrust,

46:45.929 --> 46:48.223
thrust, thrust.
You have to rotate.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.933
Yeah, well, I'd do
a hell of a lot better

46:50.016 --> 46:51.810
if we were in an actual bed.

46:51.893 --> 46:54.270
I mean, this is, what,
the smallest car in America?

46:54.354 --> 46:56.523
I mean, I'm cramping up.

46:56.606 --> 46:59.234
Did the cavemen
have beds? No.

46:59.692 --> 47:00.902
Did Tarzan?

47:00.985 --> 47:02.612
Did that pro surfer I dated?

47:02.695 --> 47:03.905
All right, that's it.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.281
That's it.
We're going again,

47:05.365 --> 47:06.991
all right,
and I'm not letting you

47:07.075 --> 47:08.952
out of this car
until I get a ten.

47:09.035 --> 47:10.453
This is my car, punk.

47:10.537 --> 47:12.121
Hey, I don't care
how long this takes.

47:12.205 --> 47:13.957
Okay, well,
wake me when it's over.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.458
All right.

47:15.542 --> 47:19.003
Oh, God. Oh!

47:20.964 --> 47:24.133
Evening, my
nightcap-swigging brethren.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.010
I'll take a Jamie,
double-double.

47:26.094 --> 47:28.096
Heavy, heavy pour.

47:30.932 --> 47:32.600
Rocks or neat?

47:32.684 --> 47:34.936
Well, Jesus, when you
say it like that, neither.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.145
What's wrong with you?

47:36.229 --> 47:37.772
Troubles
with the lady.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.108
Oh, yeah?
Me too, Kev.

47:41.025 --> 47:42.694
Since when do you
have a lady, Frank?

47:42.777 --> 47:45.864
Well, it's fairly recent,
but we're going strong.

47:45.947 --> 47:49.075
She does run a bit hot
in terms of mental illness,

47:49.158 --> 47:50.910
so I had to step out,
take some me time

47:50.994 --> 47:53.621
while she gets
her fire danger level

47:53.705 --> 47:56.583
from "catastrophic"
to "low-moderate,"

47:56.666 --> 47:58.334
but damn...

47:58.418 --> 47:59.836
her blaze

47:59.919 --> 48:02.755
is a glorious thing to behold.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.091
You didn't
answer me, so...

48:05.925 --> 48:07.302
I made it neat.

48:09.846 --> 48:12.640
Haven't seen him like this
since that...

48:12.724 --> 48:15.101
sports team lost the thing
I don't care about.

48:15.184 --> 48:17.896
Yeah, he wants
another baby.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.355
But V said no,
shut him down.

48:19.439 --> 48:20.899
Hey, Kev, I can get you
another baby.

48:20.982 --> 48:22.191
What are you willing
to spend?

48:22.984 --> 48:23.985
What?

48:24.068 --> 48:26.029
There's always
an extra Gallagher at my house.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.655
Give you two for one.

48:29.324 --> 48:30.491
You know what, Frank?

48:35.496 --> 48:38.082
God, I'm so sad,
I can't even tell off Frank.

48:49.135 --> 48:51.763
Wow, you actually
came back.

48:51.846 --> 48:53.598
What do you mean?
Of course I came back.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.350
What the hell happened to her?

48:55.433 --> 48:56.893
Thorazine.
Had to be done.

48:56.976 --> 49:00.063
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.189
Ingrid!

49:01.272 --> 49:03.274
Ingrid, are you there?

49:03.358 --> 49:05.068
- Hello.
- I had to dose her,

49:05.151 --> 49:06.819
Frank. She was
a danger to herself.

49:06.903 --> 49:08.446
Come on.
No, babe, come on.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.365
Let's go take
a cold shower.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.075
Come on.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.535
Frank, Frank.
You came back.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.579
You're better than most,
I'll give you that,

49:16.663 --> 49:18.373
but you can clock out now.

49:18.456 --> 49:20.416
Thorazine's gonna
level her out.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.834
She's not gonna remember
most of this,

49:21.918 --> 49:23.002
which is for the best.

49:23.086 --> 49:25.922
How is it for the best, Randy?

49:26.005 --> 49:27.173
She's drooling.

49:27.256 --> 49:30.259
Frank, 19 years,
I've been with this woman.

49:30.343 --> 49:33.179
The only thing more constant
than this happening

49:33.262 --> 49:36.182
is me being there at the end
of it to pick her up.

49:37.350 --> 49:39.310
So you can clock out now.

50:20.268 --> 50:23.938
I'm throwing myself

No, put my song on!

50:52.175 --> 50:54.093
Come follow me.
Farhad's waiting outside.

50:54.177 --> 50:56.888
I have a surprise
for you, Fiona.

50:56.971 --> 50:58.723
Kelly, you watch Franny.

50:58.806 --> 50:59.974
Come on, guys!

51:14.530 --> 51:16.491
I looked at the damn sock.

And?

51:21.162 --> 51:22.538
And...

51:22.622 --> 51:24.582
I don't want
to have another baby.

51:24.665 --> 51:25.917
I just don't.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.461
Physically,
I don't want to do it, Kev.

51:29.670 --> 51:32.548
But I love you.

51:34.801 --> 51:38.763
And if you want to talk
about adopting a newborn,

51:38.846 --> 51:40.056
we can discuss it.

51:42.058 --> 51:44.268
Yeah, down the line.

51:44.352 --> 51:46.312
No, now.

51:46.395 --> 51:49.273
I'm a yes.
If you want to look into it,

51:49.941 --> 51:51.400
I'm a yes.

51:53.945 --> 51:55.780

52:22.223 --> 52:23.975
I'm driving your ass
to the South Side?

52:24.058 --> 52:25.476
Fair enough.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.644
You know, I haven't
fucked that much

52:26.727 --> 52:28.146
since seventh grade
summer camp.

52:28.229 --> 52:30.148
I'm definitely gonna have
a yeast infection tomorrow.

52:30.231 --> 52:32.567
Well, when that clears up,
you wanna do this again?

52:32.650 --> 52:34.110
Yeah.

52:34.193 --> 52:36.445
I'll bring you the Monistat
receipts for reimbursement.

52:36.529 --> 52:37.989
And maybe get
some cranberry juice too.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.533
That's for UTIs, dumbass.

52:45.121 --> 52:46.330
Don't call me.

52:46.414 --> 52:47.790
Yeah, already forgot
your name.

53:03.556 --> 53:05.474
Sleep well, my love.

53:06.309 --> 53:07.727
Sleep better than well,

53:07.810 --> 53:09.562
my peach.

53:14.275 --> 53:15.484
Do you drink, Randy?

53:15.943 --> 53:17.612
From time to time, sure.

53:19.822 --> 53:20.990
Must be tough

53:21.073 --> 53:22.867
being her
self-appointed caretaker

53:22.950 --> 53:24.452
all the time, huh?

53:24.535 --> 53:26.162
Sometimes,

53:26.245 --> 53:28.247
but it defines my life.

53:28.915 --> 53:31.209
- "Defines my life"?
- Yeah.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.586
Say some more about that.

53:34.837 --> 53:36.339
I live next to her,

53:36.422 --> 53:38.507
work next to her,
protect her.

53:38.591 --> 53:41.969
I mean...that's a lot.
Thank you.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.473
But love is love.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.975
Love is love, yes.

53:48.059 --> 53:50.019
You think Ingrid wants you

53:50.102 --> 53:51.687
to live your life
the way you are,

53:51.771 --> 53:53.022
entirely about her?

53:53.105 --> 53:54.440
- Probably not.
- Mm.

53:54.523 --> 53:55.858
But what can I do?

53:55.942 --> 53:58.653
What can you do?

53:59.737 --> 54:02.573
And yet you know what I see
when I look at you, Ran?

54:03.032 --> 54:05.117
I see a strong,

54:05.201 --> 54:08.579
bold, beautiful man
who needs a break.

54:11.624 --> 54:13.000
- Really?
- You're not meant

54:13.084 --> 54:15.044
to be cooped up,
dispensing drugs all day.

54:15.127 --> 54:16.796
You need some you time.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.090
Ingrid needs me.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.841
Don't worry about her
for a second.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.843
What do you want, Randy?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.974
Wow.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.476
What does
Randy want?

54:35.731 --> 54:38.609
I want to see
Mount Fuji, Frank.

54:38.693 --> 54:39.694
I do.

54:40.861 --> 54:43.572
Then you get
your goddamn phone

54:43.656 --> 54:45.449
right now
and book a flight.

54:45.533 --> 54:46.993
You earned it.

54:49.370 --> 54:50.955
- I have?
- Don't you think Ingrid

54:51.038 --> 54:53.124
wants you
to live your life?

54:55.835 --> 54:57.086
Yeah.

54:58.587 --> 54:59.839
Yeah.

54:59.922 --> 55:01.507
Yeah.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.884
Okay.
You're right.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.679
God, you're right.

55:06.762 --> 55:08.931
I'm gonna see
Mount Fuji.

55:09.015 --> 55:10.850
I know.

55:12.601 --> 55:13.602
Thank you.

55:13.686 --> 55:15.229
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't thank me.

55:15.313 --> 55:17.064
Thank yourself.
We did some good work

55:17.148 --> 55:20.609
here today--
some real breakthroughs.

55:20.693 --> 55:21.819
We're almost there.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.573
- What the fuck?
- Oh, man!

55:25.656 --> 55:26.991
Right here.

55:27.074 --> 55:27.950
Wait.

55:28.034 --> 55:29.035
Are you ready?

55:29.118 --> 55:30.995
- Uh-huh.
- Open up.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.956
That's awesome!

55:34.040 --> 55:35.791
Holy fuck, is...

55:35.875 --> 55:37.376
- is that Ford?
- Yeah.

55:39.879 --> 55:41.297
Hey, nicely done, Debs.

55:41.380 --> 55:42.548
Great job.

55:42.631 --> 55:44.759
Fucking great work.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.303
Someone help, please.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.638
Anyone.

55:49.722 --> 55:50.723
Instead of taking videos,

55:50.806 --> 55:51.849
could someone help me
get down, please,

55:51.932 --> 55:53.225
for fuck's sake?

55:53.309 --> 55:54.310
Thinking we got
a couple minutes

55:54.393 --> 55:55.853
before the cops come,
so choose quick.

55:55.936 --> 55:57.605
- Paddle, sock full of rocks...
- Oh-ho!

55:57.688 --> 55:59.398
- Oh.
- ...paintball gun,

55:59.482 --> 56:01.984
or crossbow, if you want
to Katniss Everdeen this shit.

56:02.068 --> 56:03.152
Oh, asshole!

56:03.235 --> 56:04.528
Pissed somebody off, man!

56:04.612 --> 56:06.197
Does a paintball gun hurt?

56:06.280 --> 56:08.240
- Oh, fuck yeah.
- Not if you deserve it.

56:12.495 --> 56:13.954
How much ammo
I got in this thing?

56:14.038 --> 56:15.706
Uh, probably more
than you'll ever need.

56:15.790 --> 56:18.334
All right, everybody take cover.
Come on!

56:24.924 --> 56:26.300
Oh, fuck!

56:27.635 --> 56:29.261
Get him again!

56:29.345 --> 56:31.722
Ah, fuck! Oh!

56:31.806 --> 56:33.849
Fuck you, Ford!

56:35.935 --> 56:37.645
Fucking awesome.

56:37.728 --> 56:38.896
Ha, ha!

56:43.984 --> 56:46.904
Touch the sun,

56:46.987 --> 56:49.740
you're gonna get burned.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.119
Burnt.

56:53.202 --> 56:54.412
Ya burnt!

56:56.330 --> 56:58.416
Ah, shut the hell up!

56:58.499 --> 57:00.501
You shut up!

57:00.584 --> 57:03.212
I'm a goddamn mermaid!

57:05.798 --> 57:07.591
