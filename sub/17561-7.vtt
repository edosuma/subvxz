Here's your crap.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.799
Get out.

00:07.882 --> 00:10.051
Honey, your dad is coming
all the way from Japan.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.553
Why can't I meet
my father-in-law?

00:11.636 --> 00:13.054
Because your father-in-law
doesn't know

00:13.138 --> 00:15.014
he's a father-in-law
and he ain't gonna find out

00:15.098 --> 00:17.892
'cause you're not coming back
till he's gone.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.812
Okay, so what you're saying is,
you want me back.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.898
No, what I'm saying is
my father cannot know anything

00:23.982 --> 00:25.734
about what happened
in Atlantic City

00:25.817 --> 00:27.902

Baby, you were blitzed.
He'll understand.

Okay. So, bye, Vic.
Go ahead.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.035
No! Why does Vic
have to leave?

00:36.119 --> 00:37.787
So you had a drunken marriage.

Big deal.
You're an adult.

gonna need daddy's approval?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.209
I don't know.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.378
You know what?
What is wrong with me?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.629
Why am I always so worried

00:46.713 --> 00:48.256
that my Dad's
not gonna approve of me?

00:48.339 --> 00:49.466
You're right.
I am an adult.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.801
I am gonna be
totally honest with dad.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.053
Aw!
There you go, little one.

you quit college.

in my pillowcase.

and you make out
with another guy once

09:38.786 --> 09:40.579
does that mean you're gay?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.331
- Yes.
- No.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.545
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.548
I wanted to make my grand
entrance for the silver fox.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.508
- Knock yourself out.
- Good luck with that.

09:52.591 --> 09:53.926
Gay.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.847
Hey, guys!
Well, this place is awesome.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.974
Your dad and Toshi
did a great job decorating.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.058
- Yeah.
- So?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.852
- Surprise, surprise.
- Gay.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.273
Oh, God, he's coming over!
He's coming over!

10:07.356 --> 10:09.608
- Oh, what do we do?
- Okay, act natural, okay?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.362
- Hello, father.
- Lovely weather.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.116
Ah, girls, you look so

10:17.199 --> 10:18.868
so amazing tonight!

10:18.951 --> 10:20.870
Toshi wanted me
to bring this over just for you.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.915
Oh, well, everything
looks so great, daddy.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.876
Anything else...coming out?

10:29.879 --> 10:32.590
Because whatever does come out

10:32.673 --> 10:35.009
we will love.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.470
No, I think, I think
everything's out.

Oh, wait. Toshi just gave me
a special hand roll.

It's a very special night
for Toshi and me and..

11:00.159 --> 11:01.577
I want to say a few words.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.913
Toshi! Would you, would you
come in here, please?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.581
He's coming out! He's
coming out! He's coming out!

11:05.664 --> 11:07.458
A little louder
and he won't have to.

I...after spending a long time
thinking about this

11:11.253 --> 11:14.757
I am 100% sure that this is
the right thing to do.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.886
Toshi is incredible.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.471
So, tonight

11:20.554 --> 11:24.183
I'm proud to announce
he's not only my chef.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.851
He's my partner.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.985
Say something!

11:37.238 --> 11:41.867
Uh, uh, daddy,
I'd just like to say

11:41.951 --> 11:44.954
Toshi seems
like a wonderful man.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.623
Yeah, you guys
are so cute together

11:47.706 --> 11:49.333
all tall and short.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.587
And, um, well,
we're just so glad

11:53.671 --> 11:56.715
that you chose tonight
to share with us something

11:56.799 --> 11:58.968
that I'm sure was very difficult
for you because, you know

11:59.051 --> 12:01.554
y-y-you've never
been gay before.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.809
What?

12:06.892 --> 12:07.810
You know.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.812
You and Toshi, partners.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.525
No, I meant business partners.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.693
[laughs nervously]

12:15.776 --> 12:17.820
'We're now business partners.'

12:17.903 --> 12:20.239
Ha...ha.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.575
Tell him about
what we saw in the kitchen.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.620
We-we-we-we-we

12:26.704 --> 12:28.831

in the kitchen

12:28.914 --> 12:30.791
not being business partners..

12:33.252 --> 12:36.255
Well, um...this isn't

12:36.338 --> 12:38.007
the time or place
to discuss this.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.514
Excuse us.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.896
You know...I think
that's why I'm the favorite.

our whole life

13:03.115 --> 13:04.867
has changed, y'know?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.203
I mean, everything we knew
about dad is different.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.247
He's the same but he has this
whole other life.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.000
Do you think dad ever calls
Toshi "Tushy?"

13:18.797 --> 13:22.510
You know, uh...in Japan

13:22.593 --> 13:23.886
families often
drink tea together

13:23.969 --> 13:26.430
to celebrate
a successful harvest.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.266
Or when the Dad
tells his kids he's gay.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.649
So, what should we toast to?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.818
The blue states.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.948
How about...to my girls

13:44.031 --> 13:46.700
who I love more than
anything in this whole world?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.087
So, how about that?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.466
Your dad's gay.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.844
I think it's great.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.265
It's a little shocking.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.809
All these years, I really
thought mom was a woman.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.644
Holly!

14:13.727 --> 14:16.814
Your mother,
she was an incredible woman.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.275
She was my soul mate.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
Okay, so, how did it happen?
What happened?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.611
You just said that mom
was your soul mate.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.779
Did she know?

14:23.862 --> 14:26.073
When did you make
the old...switcharooney?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.078
No, she didn't know.
I didn't know.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.456
Well, at least not for sure
until about three years ago.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.335
Okay, so, he turned gay
three years ago.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.005
The wife, may she rest in peace,
had no clue.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.466
But he loved her.
They were soul mates.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.343
Lauren, do you really think
you should be listening?

14:47.469 --> 14:48.512
No.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.306
No, I should be watching, too.

When I met your m..

14:59.732 --> 15:01.191
when I first met your mother

15:01.275 --> 15:04.945
we were both 18
and I didn't know who I was.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.157

in love with this girl.'

that I was

the greatest gift of my life.

The greatest two gifts
of my life.

And you know what, this is why

15:25.174 --> 15:29.053
I-I haven't come home
the last couple of years.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.721
I was afraid that you'd hate me.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.765
Hate you?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.099
How could we hate you?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.934
You're everything to us.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.688
Daddy, we don't care
who you're in love with.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.483
Just as long as you're happy.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.111
You have no idea
how much that means to me.

And I promise I will never
keep anything from you again.

no matter what.

drunk and stupid.

disappointed in me.
