The, uh,
theater down the street's

40:05.367 --> 40:07.634
showing <i>The Wild Bunch.</i>

40:07.634 --> 40:09.534
I was thinking of going.

40:10.934 --> 40:12.100
You like Westerns?

40:12.100 --> 40:15.100
Oh, sure.
Good versus evil and all that.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.634
Wow, I gotta say, that's--

40:16.634 --> 40:19.033
That's not what
I woulda guessed.

40:19.033 --> 40:21.334
You, uh...

40:21.334 --> 40:22.734
wanna go?

40:22.734 --> 40:25.067
To the movie with you?

40:25.067 --> 40:26.901
Yeah, to the movie with me.

40:27.834 --> 40:30.334
Um...yeah.

40:30.334 --> 40:32.367
Sure, why not?

40:34.100 --> 40:36.501
Definitely the weirdest version
of dinner and a movie

40:36.501 --> 40:37.701
I've ever experienced.

40:38.767 --> 40:40.701
[BOTH LAUGH]

40:43.100 --> 40:46.467
 <i>* And I know</i>
 <i>That things can change *</i>

40:49.133 --> 40:50.267
[CHUCKLES]

40:51.801 --> 40:53.801
What did you do?

40:53.801 --> 40:55.534
Steal my job?

40:55.534 --> 40:56.801
Yup.

40:56.801 --> 40:59.267
We got some on the walls too.
Ha-ha-ha!

41:00.267 --> 41:01.734
So, um...

41:03.100 --> 41:04.701
that was good today.

41:05.868 --> 41:08.601
Didn't feel good.
I don't...

41:10.701 --> 41:12.367
I'm not good
at that sort of thing.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.367
You were good today.

41:17.801 --> 41:20.767
Yeah, I got this, um,

41:20.767 --> 41:23.968
sick-feeling thing going on,
you know?

41:23.968 --> 41:26.567
That's just 'cause you love him.

41:26.567 --> 41:30.300
It's okay to struggle
with it, you know.

41:30.300 --> 41:33.167
Remind me to tell you
about my brother Charlie,

41:33.167 --> 41:36.167
'cause you
kind of remind me of him.

41:36.167 --> 41:37.834
Is that a good thing?

41:37.834 --> 41:39.234
[CHUCKLES LIGHTLY]

41:39.234 --> 41:41.534
Yeah, that's a good thing.

41:41.534 --> 41:42.868
'Cause I gotta tell you,

41:42.868 --> 41:44.767
in the two years that
I've been doing this job,

41:44.767 --> 41:46.367
I've had my
fair share of complaints.

41:46.367 --> 41:48.734
Um, delays, noise,

41:48.734 --> 41:51.167
but never the kind
of violent, negative response

41:51.167 --> 41:52.868
that I've gotten
on this job.

41:52.868 --> 41:55.667
What, most people don't tell
their roofers they hate them?

41:55.667 --> 41:56.968
[LAUGHS]

41:56.968 --> 41:58.300
[CHUCKLES]

42:00.234 --> 42:03.667
Then again, I haven't had
many heart-to-hearts either.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.434
This is a weird job.

42:11.167 --> 42:13.901
 <i>* Wading in the depths... *</i>

42:13.901 --> 42:16.767
I'm not a...princess,

42:16.767 --> 42:19.033
you know?

42:19.033 --> 42:20.934
If you knew
anything about me,

42:20.934 --> 42:23.868
you w-would know
I'm not a princess.

42:23.868 --> 42:27.434
 <i>* When it all gives way *</i>

42:27.434 --> 42:30.400
 <i>* I know there is more *</i>

42:30.400 --> 42:34.634
 <i>* More I wanna say... *</i>

42:34.634 --> 42:37.968
So can you see Marin
from my roof?

42:39.300 --> 42:41.734
On a clear night, yeah.

42:41.734 --> 42:44.467
 <i>* I will stand up... *</i>
Can you take me up there?

42:44.467 --> 42:47.968
 <i>* I will not fear... *</i>
Take you up on the roof?

42:47.968 --> 42:50.334
Yeah. Come on,
I wanna see what you see.

42:50.334 --> 42:52.400
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

42:52.400 --> 42:54.868
I don't know. It's, um...

42:56.801 --> 42:58.133
dangerous.

42:58.133 --> 42:59.801
It's awful high.

42:59.801 --> 43:01.534
What if you fall?

43:01.534 --> 43:03.701
Well, um,

43:03.701 --> 43:05.567
then you'll catch me.

43:09.667 --> 43:12.868
 <i>* When it comes around *</i>

43:14.767 --> 43:18.100
 <i>* Here it comes</i>
 <i>There it goes *</i>

43:18.100 --> 43:21.033
 <i>* Only life,I suppose *</i>

43:21.033 --> 43:24.334
 <i>* Hearts get torn</i>
 <i>Love is born *</i>

43:24.334 --> 43:28.334
 <i>* Gatherin' storms</i>
 <i>We're rollin' home... *</i>

43:28.334 --> 43:30.267
