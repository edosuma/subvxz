00:02.302 --> 00:06.205
It's an honor to announce
this year's Blossom Queen winner.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.573
The most important crown
that any girl can ever wear.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.082
Dylan Schoenfield.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.264
<i>Dylan.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

00:32.399 --> 00:34.095
<i>Dylan.</i>

00:34.234 --> 00:36.726
- Dylan!
- Yes, Principal Guthrie?

00:37.504 --> 00:39.302
The Blossom Queen
campaign application.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.370
- Oh.
- I need your signature.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.004
Oh, thanks.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.353
Ahem. Next.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.161
This year's going to
be <i>très fantastiquè.</i>

01:04.298 --> 01:06.199
- Know why?
- Why?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.666
Because once
I'm crowned Blossom Queen,

01:08.802 --> 01:12.170
I will be the most popular girl
at Woodlands Academy ever.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.474
Class is downstairs.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.977
Drama Club.
Easy votes, they like my dramatic flair.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.581
Oh, the very shirt
I introduced last semester.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.241
Followers. Easy votes.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.985
Film Club nerds.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.452
- You're like a movie star to them.
- Totes.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.220
Indie rock wannabes.

01:31.158 --> 01:34.151
What's with the guitars, people?
This isn't a campfire.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.695
I can't believe you used
to be friends with Amy Loubalu.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.025
Alas, it's true.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.066
Until I traded up to you two.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.059
Dylan.

01:42.302 --> 01:45.898
I took your suggestion
and got my hair cut into a bob.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.665
Definitely cuted up.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.641
See? People know I care.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.836
Easy vote.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.470
But what about Nicole Paterson?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.550
She's major competition.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.015
Lola and Hannah see me
as their leader

02:01.154 --> 02:03.123
and a leader
should never show weakness.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.020
That would be <i>très mauvais.</i>

02:05.158 --> 02:06.751
That's French for "ew."

02:09.496 --> 02:10.555
What and ever.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.666
A good candidate likes competish.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.964
If I ran for Blossom Queen unopposed
and won, boring.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.968
And who has the number one seat
on The Ramp?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.240
Dude, hey.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.437
Oh, look, Asher's holding it for me.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.242
Oh. So sweet.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.657
Oh, my.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.420
Oh!

02:39.559 --> 02:41.152
You... You geek!

02:41.294 --> 02:42.785
This is designer!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.325
No, it's tuna noodle casserole.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.525
You are so gross.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.702
Gross is just one syllable.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.601
I can't believe that popular people like me
are forced

02:52.739 --> 02:55.971
to share the same air
as nerd herders like you.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.341
What?
Forced to share the same air as me?

02:59.479 --> 03:03.678
Okay, you wear so much perfume,
you need a gas mask just to survive.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.479
Watch.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.487
Is this yesterday's fettuccine Alfredo

03:19.032 --> 03:21.558
- recycled?
- No paparazzi.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.873
Oh.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.773
So sweet.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.753
Oh, my. Oh!

03:42.923 --> 03:44.482
You... You geek!

03:44.624 --> 03:46.092
This is designer!

03:46.526 --> 03:48.722
No, it's tuna noodle casserole.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.922
You are so gross.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.099
Gross is just one syllable.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.462
Oh!

03:56.303 --> 03:57.362
That's classic.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.501
- Look what you did to my friends.
- But I didn't...

04:00.640 --> 04:02.939
I can't believe that popular people like me
are forced

04:03.076 --> 04:05.841
to share the same air
as nerd herders like you.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.081
- Ugh!
- I prefer the term "film geek."

04:10.250 --> 04:11.912
Ugh!

04:14.154 --> 04:15.452
They must practice that.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.320
<i>Casablanca.</i> Curtiz is the director.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.017
It also stars Ingrid Bergman, Peter Lorre
and Claude Rains.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.392
As Bogart's best film? I fully disagree.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.125
<i>The African Queen</i> with Katharine
Hepburn, directed by John Huston.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.894
I mean, it's miraculous.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.525
I mean, it's unbelievable. Hi.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.899
Oh, look. Film Club president
finally decided to show up.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.907
Sorry, guys.
I got stuck in traffic on the diva freeway.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.710
- Where's your lunch?
- Dylan Schoenfield's wearing it.

04:39.379 --> 04:43.407
Yeah, my food went where no mere mortal
has ever gone before.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.110
The Ramp.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.688
You need a passport to go in there.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.990
Passport? You need a robot army.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.258
With level 83 "Dragon Slayer" skills.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.631
Okay, guys, seriously,
it's a whole other alien world.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.067
A mystery species.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.902
We'll never fully understand the Populars
and the way their strange vortex works.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.644
Okay, what are you inventing now?

05:13.079 --> 05:15.173
Artificial Intelligence chess.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.319
Hey, Amy.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.323
That's a cool guitar case.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.162
Never gonna happen, friend.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.528
Thanks for the support, pal.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.895
Calculate this, Josh.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.233
You've been crushing on Amy Loubalu
since third grade.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.000
We're juniors.

05:41.141 --> 05:44.475
That's approximately 2,268 school days,
minus summer breaks,

05:44.611 --> 05:47.012
that you could have asked her out
and haven't.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.945
I'd go out with you.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.551
Guys, I don't have time for dating,
okay?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.813
The Puget Sound Film Festival
is only six weeks away.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.789
And he's our school's best shot at total
domination of the city's student film scene.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.189
- You better win.
- No. I gotta win.

06:00.327 --> 06:04.856
Okay, first prize is a summer
at a Hollywood film camp in Los Angeles.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.194
All right, I wanna make
this groundbreaking documentary

06:07.334 --> 06:09.098
that truly changes the bar.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.671
- You know, a film that establishes me
<i>I love you.</i>

06:11.805 --> 06:15.298
As the next cinematic genius.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.669
So, what's the documentary about?

06:19.813 --> 06:20.906
No idea.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.046
You have no idea.

06:25.785 --> 06:29.153
So wanna go out with me?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.827
- What...?
- No.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.329
Come in.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.628
Mr. F.?

06:43.770 --> 06:46.467
Oh, Josh.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.341
Brought my application.

06:48.475 --> 06:52.435
My favorite student and great, great.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.571
I like this.

06:54.714 --> 06:59.345
I can't wait to see what my star student
has come up with, huh?

07:00.387 --> 07:05.121
It's a documentary about the evolution
of robot voices

07:05.258 --> 07:06.851
in the science-fiction genre?

07:06.993 --> 07:11.931
Yeah. You know how no two robots
ever sound the same in any sci-fi movie?

07:12.465 --> 07:15.264
You know, you have your,
"I am a robot."

07:15.402 --> 07:17.394
Then you have these futuristic, like:

07:18.838 --> 07:23.776
Josh, your artistic vision
is robot voices?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.546
Yeah. Mr. F., I'm struggling here.

07:27.113 --> 07:31.107
I... I've got all these great ideas,
but none of them are good enough.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.553
You really would like to win that trip
to Hollywood film camp, huh?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.415
More than anything.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.461
Then challenge yourself, Josh.

07:43.363 --> 07:47.130
Choose a documentary subject matter
where you stretch your limits.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.301
Explore new territory, discover the truth.

07:51.438 --> 07:55.671
How about, instead of robots,
a human subject?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.141
A human.

07:58.611 --> 08:04.312
Okay, so challenging, truthful,
but human.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.487
- Got it.
- Right.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.885
Now, I will need a real proposal
by tomorrow.

08:10.023 --> 08:14.358
Otherwise, I will have to give
our school's slot to another student.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.258
Okay.

08:21.534 --> 08:25.266
No, I am not taking a dollar less
than listing price.

08:25.405 --> 08:29.103
Well, that's great.
I can have the paperwork sent right over.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.510
Great. Talk to you soon.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.280
Well, sweetie, what do you think?

08:35.414 --> 08:38.044
Do we turn this place
into a Sparkles Cupcakes

08:38.183 --> 08:39.618
or Accessories Barn?

08:39.753 --> 08:43.485
Dad, anyone who buys their accessories
in a barn is totes <i>tragique.</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:47.058
I vote for cupcakes,
gives it more of a glam factor.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.353
And that is why you're my top advisor.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.298
You know what? I am gonna have to head
back to the office for a late meeting.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.701
Whatevs.
Oh, I need to borrow your marketing team.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.231
Marketing team? Why?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.239
Blossom Queen. It's essential.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.207
I need signs, brochures, headshots.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.245
Oh, well, absolutely not.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.211
But Nicole Paterson
has the whole varsity

09:08.348 --> 09:11.011
and JV football team
making posters for her campaign.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.746
Yes, and you have ingenuity.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.586
If you wanna win,
you need to do this on your own.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.055
You're a smart girl.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.422
Gotta pull yourself up
by your bootstraps.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.490
Yes, this is Alan.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.391
Bootstraps?
What does that even mean?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.526
Um, hello, boots have zippers.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.935
I should know, I tried on 17 pairs
at Shoes Unlimited last week

09:33.073 --> 09:36.237
and none of the 16 pairs I bought
had straps.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.611
Bad reception?

09:38.745 --> 09:40.236
Yeah, I, well...

09:41.247 --> 09:43.773
Dude, seriously, this is not refundable.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.756
Tell you what, here's 20 percent off
on your next phone.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.120
Thanks.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.138
It's imported leather.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.475
Imported from where?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.777
Somewhere foreign
with lots of shipping costs, duh?

10:17.917 --> 10:19.749
Yeah, probably Italy, duh?

10:21.087 --> 10:22.282
Bee?

10:22.422 --> 10:25.153
Bee. Oh, my gosh, a bee.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.654
Bee. Bee. Oh!

10:30.530 --> 10:32.294
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.298
Stop. Oh, my gosh.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.925
Oh, my.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.539
Oh! Oh, no. Oh, my gosh.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.732
My purse.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.605
Help. Somebody help.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.816
Someone turn the fountain off.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.884
Chop-chop.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.825
Help. Help me, my purse. Ah!

11:03.129 --> 11:04.427
It's a Serge Sanchez.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.227
Will somebody help me?
Someone turn the fountain off.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.496
Mr. Farley said that my movie subject
should be human.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.538
Dylan Schoenfield's human.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.935
Sort of.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.440
She's definitely a challenge.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.044
Big challenge.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.205
Someone turn off the fountain, now.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.211
Why aren't they listening to me?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.181
Give me your phone.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.317
- Who are you calling?
- 911.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.622
It's that geek from lunch today.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.589
He's saving your purse.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.318
What?

11:37.430 --> 11:41.128
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.539
Really?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.517
Oh.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.376
Ugh!

12:41.828 --> 12:43.319
Ew!

12:48.534 --> 12:51.527
What?
- Go, Woodlands.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.700
Vote Paterson.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.608
Imported leather
needs specialty cleaning.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.977
When my cell phone got wet, I...

13:02.215 --> 13:03.376
My Serge Sanchez.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.146
You named your purse?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.617
Not so fast.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.914
I have a proposal for you.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.718
Whatever it is, the answer is NO,
spells no way.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.290
Can I at least propose
the proposal first?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.257
I want you to star in my movie
for the film festival.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.233
Oh, what? Star?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.930
Uh, what's it...? What's it about?

13:25.071 --> 13:27.131
You. Your life.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.833
You know, what it's like to be popular
and run for Blossom Queen?

13:32.445 --> 13:35.609
Nicole Paterson might have buttons
and posters,

13:35.748 --> 13:37.580
but what's that compared to a movie?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.743
Especially if it's about me.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.214
Deal.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.825
Once you lose this.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.584
Deal.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.898
The competition just got serious.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.864
It's always been serious for me.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.837
Thad?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.539
Tomorrow. Lunch. The dining hall.
We can start filming my movie then.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.112
Actually, it's my movie.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.042
Where are my shoes?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.496
You need some major CPR, Serge.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.978
Marta.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.473
I need help carrying.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.184
Marta?

14:59.999 --> 15:03.458
"Dylan, went to dentist,
dinner's in the fridge.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.697
Love, Marta."

15:15.014 --> 15:17.711
You'll be as good as new, Serge.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.081
"Amy posted a picture of Dylan."

15:56.189 --> 15:57.817
What?

16:00.159 --> 16:02.287
Why'd she do that?

16:09.735 --> 16:14.605
My mom took that photo when Amy and I
won the second grade science fair,

16:14.740 --> 16:17.175
back when we were besties.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.122
Mom died later that same year.

17:05.491 --> 17:09.484
Sometimes I like
to look through her old stuff.

17:09.628 --> 17:12.497
Makes me feel like I'm still with her.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.046
Josh, is that you?

18:09.188 --> 18:14.650
No, Mom, it's a burglar who just happens
to have keys to the front door.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.067
Hey, Mouse.
Who'd you bark at today, buddy?

18:25.204 --> 18:26.399
Who'd you bark at today?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.132
Who'd you bark at today?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.436
Oh, yes, you're a good boy.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.374
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.275
Come on. Look at me. Come on.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.006
Come on.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.666
Same to you, I think.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.172
Hey, guess what?
I found my new documentary subject.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.433
Dylan Schoenfield.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.805
- Oh, that is wonderful, hon.
- Yeah.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.002
- Who is he?
- She, Mom.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.472
- Oh.
- One of the most popular girls at school.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.243
I was gonna follow her around,
shoot her Blossom Queen campaign.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.482
I'm thinking a hard-hitting exposè
on popularity.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.116
Huh. Well, that sounds like
an ambitious project.

19:17.256 --> 19:20.920
Yeah. Speaking of projects, Mom,
what is that?

19:21.427 --> 19:26.024
Sushi-making class.
I am making a spicy dragon roll.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.667
Great.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.501
There we go. That's that.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.006
Oh, no, my miso.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.206
Hey, Mom, you just wanna phone in
for pizza instead?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.337
Oh, yes.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.673
So much better.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.486
No. No, no, no. Give me...

19:53.626 --> 19:55.390
Go and get him.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.255
Hey. Paul, it's Sandy.

20:10.242 --> 20:13.076
Oh, I like this, huh?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.545
An exposé on popularity.

20:15.681 --> 20:18.116
Yeah. You told me to challenge myself

20:18.250 --> 20:22.187
and Dylan Schoenfield's proving
to be a big challenge.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.085
Don't forget what else I said.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.692
- Seek out the truth, huh?
- Right.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.194
The best documentarians leave
their preconceived notions at the door.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.122
Uh...

20:32.264 --> 20:34.256
Totally, Mr. F., yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.662
Dylan Schoenfield, huh?

20:38.304 --> 20:43.140
Popularity could turn out
to be more complicated than you think.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.178
Welcome to the competition, Josh.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.076
Hollywood, huh?

20:48.214 --> 20:50.183
- Yeah.
- Little bit of the action.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.952
I'll see you there.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.489
Hey. You ready to start?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.717
- Almost. Hold this.
- Mm.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.455
First, some ground rules.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.087
One, we need
to set a strict filming schedule.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.029
No hanging around me before or after.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.964
Sure. Like I'd want to.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.797
Two, I need a beauty budget.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.405
So $50 a week should suffice.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.734
Beauty budget?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.706
I only get $5 a day for lunch.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.835
Three, no filming from my left side.
Ever.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.709
It's my bad side, see?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.150
They're exactly the sa...
Are you always this high-maintenance?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.880
It is not high-maintenance
to want to look nice.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.115
<i>Voila</i>, now I'm done.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.822
Hey, don't you want this?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.828
Oh, you can just set it down at my seat.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.630
- The Ramp?
- Duh, where else would we eat lunch?

22:05.691 --> 22:07.421
Dylan?

22:12.698 --> 22:14.997
We're shooting a movie.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.069
Excuse me.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.734
One small step for geeks.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.003
One giant leap for geek-kind.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.203
Not now.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.780
Why so determined
to be Blossom Queen?

22:28.914 --> 22:31.941
Because it's the best way
to ensure lifelong popularity.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.450
Aren't you already popular?

22:33.786 --> 22:36.119
Let me ask you this,
does Sunshine Lemonade advertise?

22:36.255 --> 22:38.781
Yeah, they have the commercials
with the waterskiing penguins.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.789
Oh, I like the penguins.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.064
Sunshine is already number one.
They don't need to advertise.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.065
But they do it to stay number one.
Get it?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.260
- Got it.
- Good.

22:50.402 --> 22:53.270
Everyone thinks
it's so easy being the popular girl.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.534
- It's so not easy.
- Girls, this is <i>moi's</i> movie.

22:56.675 --> 23:00.544
- If they wanna add something, that's fin...
- But being popular is so not easy.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.012
It's like royalty.
Or being the first lady.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.777
You have to live up
to impossible standards of beauty

23:05.918 --> 23:07.853
and you're expected
to be a good influence.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.922
Like I help out the less fortunate.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.751
Oh, you have a charity.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.757
<i>Absolument,</i> fashion victims.

23:19.999 --> 23:24.403
Hannah, the yellow scarf you're wearing
is washing you out.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.863
Here.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.942
Wear mine instead.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.842
See?
I just sacrificed my own outfit for hers.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.073
But it was worth it.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.013
Oh!

23:39.418 --> 23:41.284
Josh.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.850
Sorry.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.390
Oh!

23:46.892 --> 23:47.951
Hey.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.791
If you're a ten, you can only date a ten,
like Asher.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.866
- Coming to watch me play volleyball?
- Mm-hm.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.797
Dylan, he's blocking your light.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.904
Why is there a talking nerd here?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.670
Asher, we downloaded this.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.539
Josh is making a movie
about me winning Blossom Queen.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.941
Play nice?

24:09.481 --> 24:11.279
Does it mess with my volleyball sched?

24:11.417 --> 24:14.046
Oh, never. We'll work around it.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.757
Got it. Thank you.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.624
So this is what you do after school?

24:23.762 --> 24:25.253
Shopping improves the economy.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.559
Oh, how thoughtful.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.134
I know, right? I care.

24:29.268 --> 24:33.865
Right. So in a scientific sense,
how does popularity work?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.634
Are the other Blossom Queen
candidates...?

24:35.774 --> 24:37.174
There are levels of popularity.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.369
Anywhere from
student-council-president popular

24:39.511 --> 24:41.309
to only popular with your parents.

24:41.447 --> 24:45.441
Sure, Nicole's cheerleader popular,
but is she Blossom Queen popular?

24:45.584 --> 24:47.712
Doubtful.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.256
So how does one move up
this social scale of popularity?

24:51.757 --> 24:53.555
Well, one way
is hoping it'll rub off on you.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.217
Popularity's contagious.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.454
What? Like a cold?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.457
Duh.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.122
It's why Hannah and Lola battle
to be my better friend.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.928
Their popularity comes from mine.

25:04.269 --> 25:08.172
- Six-point-five percent sales tax on 395...
- Um...

25:08.307 --> 25:10.333
Twenty-five sixty-seven.

25:11.744 --> 25:17.479
Hate it, have it, have it, have it, have it,
hate it, I'll try some on just for fun.

25:17.616 --> 25:18.914
How many shoes do you need?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.646
One pair for each day of the year.
Why, how many do you own?

25:21.787 --> 25:23.119
You're looking at them.

25:23.689 --> 25:27.524
Clearly. Totes <i>tragique.</i>

25:28.560 --> 25:30.495
So how long's this gonna take?

25:30.629 --> 25:32.825
No filming in here.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.972
Hey, here's your chance
to tell me something about Dylan.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.267
Oh. Like what?

25:43.409 --> 25:45.708
Like does your popularity really come
from hers?

25:46.612 --> 25:49.844
We may not be as popular as Dylan,
but we do know some stuff.

25:49.982 --> 25:54.352
Like, when Dylan doesn't get her way,
she goes full-on DQM.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.749
Drama queen mode.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.517
And Asher only dates Dylan
because she worships him.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.489
And Asher loves being worshipped.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.023
Ta-da!

26:03.162 --> 26:05.563
So, what do we think?

26:09.635 --> 26:11.866
Guys, French is my trademark, duh?

26:13.372 --> 26:16.274
So Populars only hang with Populars?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.070
Cats don't hang with dogs, right?

26:18.210 --> 26:19.473
Really?

26:19.611 --> 26:20.874
That's your argument?

26:21.013 --> 26:22.311
It's better this way.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.680
If everyone stays with their own group,
there's no chance for misunderstandings.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.515
Like, what kind of misunderstandings?

26:28.654 --> 26:30.020
Take you and me, for instance.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.249
If we mingled outside
of doing my movie together,

26:32.391 --> 26:34.553
you might get the wrong idea
and ask me out.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.127
Imagine the horror.

26:36.261 --> 26:40.255
- You'd be so embarrassed.
- Ahem.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.560
- Did we get it?
- Yep.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.400
We got it.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.699
Ow!

26:49.842 --> 26:52.243
- What are your plans after school?
- Uh, Pilates.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.039
But not on Tuesdays, that's yoga.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.880
After you graduate.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.010
Hopes? Dreams?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.210
What's your life goal?

27:00.352 --> 27:01.581
Blossom Queen.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.122
- After that.
- After?

27:04.256 --> 27:08.523
If I don't win Blossom Queen, my
life is officially O-V-E-R, over.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.686
Oh, you missed a spot.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.523
I have no words. Nothing.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.093
<i>Josh?</i>

27:20.072 --> 27:22.064
Snack break? It's satay.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.903
It's from my Thai cooking class.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.469
Uh...

27:26.645 --> 27:28.136
It's not good.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.740
How's the big movie coming?

27:32.417 --> 27:33.578
<i>Josh.</i>

27:33.719 --> 27:34.880
<i>Josh.</i>

27:35.020 --> 27:38.184
<i>Get my shoes. My feet are cold.</i>

27:41.994 --> 27:43.895
Well, she's...

27:44.096 --> 27:45.428
- Well, I don't...
<i>- Josh.</i>

27:45.564 --> 27:46.862
- Diva?
- Yeah.

27:46.999 --> 27:51.664
Yeah. You know, I wanna make this true
documentary about high school popularity,

27:51.803 --> 27:53.499
but, Mom, this is a joke.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.473
Well, I mean, sometimes people behave
a certain way

27:56.608 --> 27:59.203
because they have something else
going on.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.676
What's the real Dylan like?

28:00.812 --> 28:02.337
Real, Mom?

28:02.481 --> 28:05.041
Okay, the only real thing
about Dylan Schoenfield

28:05.184 --> 28:06.812
is that she's really annoying.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.417
You have to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.048
- Mom.
- You have to be an archeologist.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.184
Dig deeper.

28:26.738 --> 28:28.730
Oh!

28:29.341 --> 28:31.901
This is going to look fantastic.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.707
I can't believe we were invited
to a beach party with the Populars.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.873
It's strictly work, okay?

28:38.116 --> 28:39.243
Heh. Nice bonnet.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.750
Sun is evil.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.981
Well, I, for one, plan to have fun.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.418
Hey.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.857
Oh, finally.
I see you brought your non-tourage.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.060
This is Ari, my second AD.

28:51.196 --> 28:53.392
He's in charge of all the B-roll.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.530
Whatever all that means.

28:56.001 --> 29:01.338
Okay, well, you know, I'm going
to take some, uh, additional shots.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.612
Sorry we were late,
I had to get directions.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.114
Directions? You've never been
to the beach? Everybody likes the beach.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.548
Not me.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.210
Shocker, not everyone's
into the same things you are.

29:16.154 --> 29:17.679
I find that hard to believe.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.150
Heh.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.025
Come on.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.792
Okay.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.933
Come on, Eagles. Let's go.

29:37.075 --> 29:38.805
Next time, baby. It's okay.

29:39.911 --> 29:42.471
We're still two points behind.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.975
Go, guys, come on.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.145
- Water, babe?
- Yeah.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.017
Excuse me.

29:55.661 --> 30:00.326
Hi. Despite our northern latitude,
the sun still emits dangerous UV rays.

30:02.501 --> 30:06.563
It's like sitting in a fryer at Burger
World without the side of onion rings.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.006
SPF 80?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.341
Oh, yeah.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.076
Oh, yeah.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.386
Come here.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.988
Hey, Amy.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.856
Nice, uh, stick thing.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.695
Thanks. It's called a Gator Grabber.

31:07.265 --> 31:10.497
Gator? Like alligator. Whoa.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.127
- Ha, ha.
- That's weird.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.001
- Saving the environment?
- Yeah.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.205
Yeah. Go green.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.543
Hey, doing okay.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.585
Amy and I
had our first real conversation.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.153
Should be called a Croc Catcher

31:38.296 --> 31:40.197
because crocodiles
actually do eat garbage.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.991
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.731
Josh.

31:44.870 --> 31:47.203
Josh? Josh?

31:47.572 --> 31:49.370
Josh,
enough with the unscheduled break.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.443
It's time to get back to work.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.509
Hi to you too, Dylan.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.136
How are you these days?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.840
I'd be better if strangers didn't tag me
in ancient pics online.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.542
- Come on, Josh.
- Strangers?

31:59.684 --> 32:02.415
Gee, as I recall it,
we used to be friends.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.353
Josh, come on, let's go.
Chop-chop, time is money.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.957
Bye, Amy.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.722
Bye, Josh.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.029
Oh, I so saved you back there.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.140
You should have been focused
on filming me, instead of flirting.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.400
Flirting?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.567
I wasn't... I wa... No, no, no.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.139
I don't flirt.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.975
Oh, clearly. It was totes <i>tragique.</i>

32:29.114 --> 32:31.083
It's more obvious
that you like Amy Loubalu

32:31.216 --> 32:33.014
than Nicole Paterson's hair extensions.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.450
Yeah. I mean, no.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.655
Wait.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.380
You two used to be friends?

32:39.524 --> 32:43.154
Ugh. I know, hard to believe.
Back in elementary school.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.787
Are you getting my good side, right?
Over here.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.661
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.126
So, what happened?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.793
Look at her and look at me.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.406
Life happened, I.e. I'm popular.

32:54.539 --> 32:55.632
Amy's popular.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.174
We've gone over this, Josh.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.279
She's "I'm in a girl band" popular.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.280
Not Blossom Queen popular.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.419
Oh, no, the volleyball game's over.
Asher.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.750
Ash.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.282
- Hey, where are you guys going?
- The movies. It's dark.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.055
And no one steals our snacks.

33:20.365 --> 33:24.132
Victory means Pizza Land.

33:24.269 --> 33:27.637
Two large Meat Volcanoes,
triple cheese. You ready, Dyl?

33:27.772 --> 33:29.468
Oh, well, Marta made me a pizza
last night,

33:29.608 --> 33:32.442
so I called ahead
and got us all reservations

33:32.577 --> 33:34.170
to the new sushi place downtown.

33:34.946 --> 33:37.142
Raw fish?

33:37.282 --> 33:39.012
Ralph.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.510
Have fun with that.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.780
- I'm outtie with my boys.
- Yeah.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.890
Yeah.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.754
I don't like fish either.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.931
I could eat pizza every day. Heh.

33:56.768 --> 33:57.827
Wait.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.267
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

33:59.404 --> 34:02.806
Call 911. Call 911.
Someone's stealing my car.

34:02.941 --> 34:04.637
What are you doing? Stop, what is this?

34:04.776 --> 34:08.338
Six unpaid parking tickets.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.539
Oops.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.946
- Seven.
- Ugh.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.882
When? You mean those little flyer thingies
on my windshield?

34:15.020 --> 34:17.683
- They ain't greeting cards, lady.
- Oh, no.

34:18.255 --> 34:19.690
Please?

34:19.925 --> 34:21.757
Please?

34:24.462 --> 34:26.954
Oh...

34:32.837 --> 34:34.498
You surely have a car, right?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.130
Yeah.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.634
This is yours?

34:37.775 --> 34:39.745
And it runs? On real gas?

34:39.878 --> 34:41.402
So she's a little old.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.813
Old? This thing is, like, prehistoric.

34:46.650 --> 34:50.782
You know, somewhere a caveman
is missing his car.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.420
Hello?

34:55.226 --> 34:57.195
Thank you.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.568
Why are you hiding?

35:06.004 --> 35:07.404
It's called shame.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.075
Well, they're gone now.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.814
Okay, turning on the radio
isn't gonna help our battery situation.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.944
News? Gross.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.317
What, the news bores you?

35:25.056 --> 35:27.321
Ever heard of pop music?
We're young, live a little.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.962
- Uh-oh.
- What "oh"?

35:37.602 --> 35:39.127
What's that?

35:39.270 --> 35:40.795
Josh, that never happens to my car.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.238
What is that? That's smoke.

35:44.109 --> 35:46.340
How are you gonna fix it?

35:51.549 --> 35:53.177
We're gonna need to find a gas station.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.514
- We?
- Fine.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.781
Stay here.

35:58.590 --> 36:03.858
There is no way I am risking
being seen hanging out in this thing.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.096
Josh.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.130
Ugh. Stupid phone.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.327
Who are you so busy texting?

36:11.469 --> 36:12.528
The girls.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.164
Telling them that this is the W-O-R-S-T,
worst day of my life.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.969
Yeah? Ditto.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.237
Ow! Oh! Ow, ow, ow.

36:20.645 --> 36:22.546
My ankle. I think it's broken.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.842
You probably just twisted it.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.315
Well, I can't walk, it could swell up.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.578
You know, this is all your fault.

36:30.722 --> 36:33.157
If you didn't have a junker car,
this never would've happened.

36:33.291 --> 36:36.022
Sorry we don't all have nice BMW's.

36:36.161 --> 36:39.222
Which you'd be driving right now
if you weren't such a diva.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.855
- What did you call me?
- Nothing.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.331
You said something. I heard.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.095
- Fine.
- Ow.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.494
Diva. I called you a diva.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.472
Precious cargo here, buddy. And don't
ever call me that word ever again.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.805
What? Diva? D-I-V-A, what's that spell?

36:52.944 --> 36:54.572
Oh, that's right, diva.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.478
Diva? I'm a movie star.
You said so yourself.

36:57.615 --> 37:00.084
No, what you are is a selfish whiner.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.153
I'm talented. Take that back or I'll...

37:02.287 --> 37:04.756
- Or what?
- I'll fire you from my movie.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.915
It's my movie. I'm the director.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.653
If anyone's fired, it's you, you diva.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.394
- Ew. You're fired.
- No, you're fired.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.828
Wait. Where are you going?

37:13.965 --> 37:15.331
I always get the last word.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.197
Nope, not today.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.668
But how am I gonna get home?

37:19.904 --> 37:22.305
Uh, there's this thing called the bus.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.772
Enjoy the ride.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.308
Bus?

37:27.645 --> 37:29.910
I got rid of the drama queen.

37:30.048 --> 37:34.110
I'm sure it's not too late
to change documentary subjects.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.479
Right?

37:36.621 --> 37:39.887
I'm afraid it's too late for you
to change your documentary subject.

37:41.025 --> 37:44.052
- You'll never get a new film done in time.
- Yeah.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.463
You're not a quitter, Josh.
What happened?

37:46.931 --> 37:48.957
It's Dylan Schoenfield, all right?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.126
She's too much of a challenge.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.231
Sometimes the truth isn't easy.

37:57.175 --> 37:59.974
It's a shame to think Woodlands
won't even have an official entry

38:00.111 --> 38:01.739
in the film festival this year.

38:03.481 --> 38:04.779
Now, will it?

38:06.384 --> 38:07.818
Okay, you can do this.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.215
- Knock them dead.
- Thanks.

38:13.958 --> 38:18.089
Thank you. Thank you, everybody,
and hello, fellow Woodlanders.

38:18.229 --> 38:21.131
Dylan Schoenfield here,
like you don't know.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.861
Anyway,
vote for me for Blossom Queen

38:24.002 --> 38:29.134
because this school deserves to be ruled
by something sweet.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.776
Whoo! Who wants candy?

38:32.076 --> 38:34.238
Everybody loves chocolate, right?

38:34.379 --> 38:37.315
It's sweet and it's me.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.974
Everyone gets their turn.

38:40.552 --> 38:44.990
Hi, everyone, it's me, Nicole Paterson,
your next Blossom Queen.

38:49.394 --> 38:50.692
Ready, okay.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.463
N stands for nice.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.198
I stands for integrity.

38:54.432 --> 38:55.957
C stands for cool.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.659
O stands for original.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.528
L stands for loyal.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.470
And E stands
for extremely delicious cupcakes.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.607
Go, Woodlands.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.882
Vote Paterson. Ha-ha-ha.

39:19.757 --> 39:22.056
Whoo! Cupcakes for everyone.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.288
Come get your cupcakes.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.261
Oh, no, she did not.

39:26.397 --> 39:28.093
Oh, yes, she did.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.259
- Can we get a cupcake too?
- Oh, vote for Paterson.

39:30.401 --> 39:31.733
Vote for Paterson.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.395
Dylan.

39:33.538 --> 39:37.976
Ian Green complimented my new haircut
and then he asked me to spring formal.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.168
Awesome, right?

39:39.310 --> 39:40.608
Oh, Olivia, that's great.

39:40.745 --> 39:41.974
So I can count on your vote?

39:43.581 --> 39:44.913
Uh...

39:49.554 --> 39:50.817
What and ever, Dyl.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.150
Cupcakes are lame.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.849
You have a movie
being made about you.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.893
Yeah, you're gonna be a star.

39:56.027 --> 39:59.520
Yeah, like Nicole Paterson
can compete with that?

40:03.334 --> 40:10.332
The soldiers of ancient Greece
fought in a phalanx.

40:10.475 --> 40:11.738
Latin for finger.

40:12.210 --> 40:17.114
A phalanx
is a rectangular mass military formation,

40:17.248 --> 40:22.380
usually composed entirely
of heavy infantry.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.045
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.783
The Spartan hoplites combined
with the narrow space of Thermopylae

40:26.925 --> 40:28.985
made for
a seriously not-glamorous battle.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.561
But I've got my own battles.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.290
I'll never win Blossom Queen
without my movie.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.300
The persuasive qualities of the phalanx

40:37.435 --> 40:40.997
were its relative simplicity and low cost,

40:41.139 --> 40:44.109
as well as being a source
of political influence.

40:45.443 --> 40:49.539
As well, sometimes when the phalanxes
were pushed at top speed,

40:49.681 --> 40:50.808
they would ram.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.477
Thus we learn
the term Greece Lightning.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.049
Heh.

41:11.602 --> 41:15.300
Bela Lugosi, Frank Langella,
Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken...

41:15.440 --> 41:18.342
Christopher Walken. He played the
Headless Horseman in <i>Sleepy Hollow.</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:20.570
- He would never be Dracula.
- Christopher Walken.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.180
You know, I'm gonna suck your blood.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.215
Gonna do it. Gonna bite your neck,
it's gonna hurt. Put a Band-Aid on.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.945
Just don't stab me in the heart,
it's rude. Blah. Blah, blah...

41:28.319 --> 41:29.480
Steven.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.321
I'm with them.

41:36.761 --> 41:38.787
Hey, can I cutsies in line with you?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.057
What are you doing here?

41:40.198 --> 41:43.691
I'm here to see <i>Flight
of the Navigator.</i>

41:44.102 --> 41:45.161
Duh.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.334
Wait, you're into sci-fi?

41:47.839 --> 41:49.171
Who doesn't like science?

41:49.307 --> 41:51.139
And fiction? Together?

41:51.275 --> 41:54.507
Wow, it's like skinny jeans
and ballet flats. Heh.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.851
Speaking of, I'm liking the new look.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.046
Oh, move up.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.533
Thanks.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.025
Um, what's Dylan doing here?

42:18.169 --> 42:19.933
I'm supposed to be the only girl.

42:20.071 --> 42:23.303
The Film Society has an open policy.
Right?

42:23.441 --> 42:25.774
Right. It's in our bylaws.

42:25.910 --> 42:29.870
You know, we don't wanna
be exclusionary, like the Populars.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.845
So, what are we talking about?

42:31.983 --> 42:34.179
Not you. I mean...

42:34.619 --> 42:36.451
The movie. What else?

42:36.587 --> 42:39.318
I question the notion
that the protagonist didn't age.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.359
There is no plot if he did grow older.
It's called a movie.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.621
They didn't explain
that in the exposition, did they?

42:44.762 --> 42:46.788
- Where's your suspension of disbelief?
- You know...

42:46.931 --> 42:48.763
You wanna halfsies, Caitlin?

42:49.133 --> 42:50.931
Anything to add, Dylan?

42:53.204 --> 42:55.230
It's called time dilation, people.

42:55.373 --> 42:57.239
As Einstein theorized
in the twin paradox,

42:57.375 --> 42:59.708
the passage of time
is linked to the speed of the observer,

42:59.844 --> 43:03.110
that traveling to and from the planet
Phaelon 250 times the speed of light

43:03.247 --> 43:06.046
would virtually suspend aging, duh?

43:09.720 --> 43:12.815
So I've discovered
that there is such a thing as a bus.

43:12.957 --> 43:16.325
I've been taking it everywhere lately,
it's green.

43:17.028 --> 43:20.226
Okay, so my dad grounded
the Dylish-mobile

43:20.364 --> 43:22.663
until I can pay off my parking tickets.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.429
It's all good, I'm parked down here.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.896
So, what's with the secret smarts?

43:28.039 --> 43:29.473
Exactly. They're secret.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.473
Now, let's keep it that way.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.704
Yeah, heaven forbid anyone thought
you had a brain

43:34.846 --> 43:36.314
in that pretty little head of yours.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.678
Only nerds get A's.

43:38.816 --> 43:39.909
You think I'm pretty?

43:40.051 --> 43:41.883
Sure. Doesn't everyone?

43:43.221 --> 43:48.558
Okay, so look, I was thinking
I could nicely un-fire you from my movie.

43:48.693 --> 43:54.325
Really? You mean,
I could nicely re-hire you for my movie?

43:55.233 --> 43:57.896
Word on the street is that you had
to drop out of the film festival

43:58.035 --> 43:59.970
because you don't have a film anymore.

44:00.104 --> 44:03.131
I'm guessing you wanna win that just
as bad as I wanna win Blossom Queen?

44:03.608 --> 44:06.737
Fair enough. But under one condition.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.146
No more diva.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.680
What? I was never a diva.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.482
Bus stop is that way.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.590
Fine. Deal,

44:19.957 --> 44:21.016
part two.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.461
Deal, part two.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.263
So is your car gonna start
this time or...?

44:27.632 --> 44:29.498
The fun is in the mystery.

44:30.635 --> 44:31.694
Come on.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.532
Okay.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.374
Home sweet...

44:46.250 --> 44:47.309
Wow.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.820
It's big.

44:50.721 --> 44:53.020
Real inviting, right?

44:53.291 --> 44:54.623
Is your dad at work?

44:54.759 --> 44:55.954
Yeah.

44:56.093 --> 44:57.561
Where's your mom?

44:58.563 --> 45:00.691
She passed away.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.262
I was 8.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.501
I had no...

45:06.804 --> 45:09.865
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

45:12.176 --> 45:14.338
So you wanna come in? Hang for a bit?

45:14.478 --> 45:16.071
Sure.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.519
Okay, so, what does your dad do?

45:21.652 --> 45:24.019
Oh, he owns a bunch of real estate
around town.

45:24.155 --> 45:27.523
So he's either always working
or hanging with his girlfriend.

45:27.658 --> 45:30.651
Yeah. My dad lives in San Diego.

45:30.795 --> 45:33.162
Guess we both only have one parent.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.596
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

45:36.300 --> 45:40.670
What I'm about to share with you
is a highly top-secret recipe.

45:40.805 --> 45:43.741
The everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
sundae.

45:43.874 --> 45:45.399
Yeah, I've never heard of that before.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.671
Duh, what do you think "top secret"
means?

45:47.812 --> 45:53.046
And that secret is you find every sugary,
gooey substance

45:53.184 --> 45:56.882
you could possibly find in the kitchen
and mix it all together.

45:57.021 --> 45:58.751
What are we waiting for?

45:58.889 --> 46:03.520
Welcome to the
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae.

46:03.661 --> 46:07.063
You wanna get your ice cream in there.
You want a variety of ice cream.

46:07.198 --> 46:08.632
You think that's enough ice cream?

46:08.766 --> 46:09.859
Gummy bears.

46:10.001 --> 46:11.765
I love gummy bears.
You want a gummy bear?

46:11.902 --> 46:12.961
Sprinkles.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.629
Ooh.

46:14.839 --> 46:17.001
Worms.

46:17.141 --> 46:18.734
Gross.

46:19.210 --> 46:21.338
Ooh.

46:21.679 --> 46:23.807
Gummy bears
and chocolate chips together?

46:27.652 --> 46:29.314
What you gonna do?

46:29.453 --> 46:30.944
What you gonna do about it?

46:31.088 --> 46:32.249
What you gonna do about that?

46:32.390 --> 46:33.449
Oh-ho-ho.

46:33.591 --> 46:35.253
Dylish.

46:35.893 --> 46:38.453
So, what's the 411 on your Amy crush?

46:39.063 --> 46:40.998
Although I don't know
why you're crushing on her.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.562
Where's the peanut butter?

46:42.700 --> 46:44.669
You know,
I didn't even think that nerds dated.

46:45.303 --> 46:48.171
Geeks.
Okay, and we are people too, Dylan.

46:48.939 --> 46:52.103
Since we're talking
about personal 411s,

46:52.243 --> 46:53.472
what's with you and Asher?

46:53.611 --> 46:57.048
- What about us?
- Well, he's kind of an idiot.

46:57.181 --> 46:59.741
Gee, I don't remember asking you
your opinion.

46:59.884 --> 47:01.216
Hey, you started it.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.321
Talking about me and my "love life."

47:03.788 --> 47:07.919
Exactly. "Love life" implies you're dating,
which you are not.

47:09.093 --> 47:10.652
I know what my movie needs.
A makeover.

47:10.795 --> 47:12.696
No, please, no more shopping footage.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.488
Not for me, for you.

47:14.632 --> 47:16.692
Here, I can get some before footage
of my work.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.167
I'm not one
of your fashion victim charities.

47:19.303 --> 47:22.205
Okay, Dyl? I like the way I am.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.138
You would.

47:25.743 --> 47:27.473
More whipped cream?

47:46.630 --> 47:48.599
Snoop much?

47:51.102 --> 47:53.071
Is this your mom?

47:55.439 --> 47:58.841
Yeah. She met my dad
at the Woodlands Spring Formal.

47:58.976 --> 48:01.002
Crazy, huh?

48:02.480 --> 48:05.746
Wait. Was your mom Blossom Queen?

48:06.150 --> 48:07.709
Back in the olden days.

48:07.852 --> 48:09.650
1985.

48:10.054 --> 48:11.522
Wow.

48:11.756 --> 48:12.849
I bet you miss her.

48:14.692 --> 48:16.422
Lots.

48:16.894 --> 48:20.023
This house gets kind of lonely
with just me and my dad.

48:21.766 --> 48:27.069
So when you said there's nothing more
to life than winning Blossom Queen...

48:29.373 --> 48:32.775
Yeah, because of my mom.

48:33.544 --> 48:37.345
If I win, it's like we're still connected.

48:38.282 --> 48:40.478
Like she's still with me.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.920
You know what, I'll do it.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.583
I'll do the makeover.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.956
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:52.029 --> 48:55.261
Let's start with this.
I'm getting so excited.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.268
Knees higher. Chin up.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.806
Make sure your elbows move
with the rope.

49:36.941 --> 49:38.773
That's pretty good.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.344
Okay, let's go, let's go, come on.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.738
I'm not used to sweating.

49:43.881 --> 49:46.248
Yeah, it shows,
but girls like a sporty guy.

49:47.151 --> 49:50.883
I don't think jump roping
is my thing. Ugh.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.954
Up. Up.

49:54.391 --> 49:57.486
Oh, Serge Sanchez's new cologne,
Man Power.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.756
Man Power?

50:14.144 --> 50:15.806
Turn him around, I wanna see the front.

50:19.316 --> 50:22.548
Hey, turn it off,
I'm the only documentarian here.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.948
Now show him.

50:26.390 --> 50:27.585
Ridiculous.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.023
Wait, is that a compliment?

50:29.159 --> 50:31.219
Josh, upload on the lingo already?

50:31.695 --> 50:34.392
- Thank you, it looks fantastic.
- Mm-hm.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.626
Now, go see the finished look.

50:36.767 --> 50:38.531
Oh, wait.

50:48.846 --> 50:53.250
See? It's not so high-maintenance
to wanna look nice.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.044
And now, for the finishing touch.

50:56.186 --> 50:57.745
What?

50:57.888 --> 51:01.325
A second pair of shoes,
since I ruined the first. Heh.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.222
Really?

51:04.161 --> 51:07.097
Awesome. Thank you, Dylan.

51:08.999 --> 51:12.231
We'll tell my dad it's beauty budget
for the movie.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.564
My mom.

51:17.708 --> 51:20.041
She wants me to pick up naan bread
on my way home.

51:20.177 --> 51:22.169
I love Indian food.

51:22.313 --> 51:25.078
I have to go to dinner with my dad
and his stupid girlfriend.

51:25.215 --> 51:26.274
Thanks.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.886
Well, you can come over if you want.

51:29.253 --> 51:30.744
Oh, no, you don't have to.

51:30.888 --> 51:33.414
I know, but you're welcome to.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.085
Okay, what's the hold up?

51:39.630 --> 51:40.791
Thank you.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.333
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

51:46.070 --> 51:48.904
So, this is it, home, sweet home.

51:49.039 --> 51:50.371
Hey, you get to meet Mouse today.

51:50.507 --> 51:52.066
Who's Mouse?

51:53.911 --> 51:54.970
Oh, hey, buddy.

52:04.254 --> 52:06.587
Oh, Josh, new hair...
Oh, my gosh, a girl.

52:07.725 --> 52:10.058
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.590
- The first Josh has brought home.
- Mom.

52:13.731 --> 52:15.825
- Oh, I need to get my camera.
- No, you don't.

52:16.233 --> 52:19.260
I bring girls home. Tons.

52:19.436 --> 52:21.268
Oh.

52:21.505 --> 52:23.474
- Oh, wait, you're...
- Dylan Schoenfield.

52:23.607 --> 52:25.098
Oh.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.044
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

52:30.514 --> 52:31.573
Oh, my samosas.

52:31.715 --> 52:33.650
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna go give Dylan
the tour.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.309
Okay.

52:35.452 --> 52:37.045
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

52:37.187 --> 52:38.519
Okay.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.284
Mom.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.693
Delish.
This is the best Indian food ever.

52:46.230 --> 52:47.459
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

52:47.598 --> 52:49.032
Thank you.

52:49.166 --> 52:50.498
Way to play my mom, Dyl.

52:50.901 --> 52:53.962
Oh. No, not at all. These samosas
are <i>très bons</i>, Mrs. Rosen.

52:54.104 --> 52:56.005
Oh, please, it's Sandy.

52:56.140 --> 52:58.132
I stopped being Mrs. Rosen
two years ago.

53:00.144 --> 53:03.512
- So are you two dating now?
- Ahem.

53:03.647 --> 53:05.946
- Uh, no. I didn't te...
- I'll help.

53:07.317 --> 53:09.218
Josh, will you take out the garbage?

53:09.353 --> 53:10.719
Yeah.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.860
- Josh and I are just friends, Sandy.
- Oh.

53:18.996 --> 53:21.158
I thought maybe
because he brought you here to meet me,

53:21.298 --> 53:23.995
I thought maybe something else
was going on.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.035
No, I already have a boyfriend.

53:26.470 --> 53:29.065
And Josh likes someone else,
so I don't know.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.232
Don't get me wrong, though,
Josh is totes awesome.

53:32.009 --> 53:33.068
Well, I think so too.

53:33.777 --> 53:35.643
Mouse. Chow time.

53:41.251 --> 53:43.379
Were you spying on us?

53:43.754 --> 53:45.017
What? No.

53:45.155 --> 53:47.852
Girl talk? Gross.
Give me the towel, I'll dry.

53:50.194 --> 53:52.095
What do you think about that?
Is that gross?

53:52.896 --> 53:55.161
Oh, my gosh. Don't do that.

53:55.299 --> 53:57.234
No.

53:58.902 --> 54:00.234
Don't do that.

54:01.505 --> 54:04.737
Don't do that.
These are designer! Stop it.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.674
No.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.313
Of course boring old walking
would turn out to be your thing.

54:17.454 --> 54:20.447
What? It's green to walk to school.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.096
You sure this isn't too much?

54:27.431 --> 54:28.490
Huh?

54:28.632 --> 54:30.066
- It means good.
- Okay.

54:30.734 --> 54:32.669
Oh, wait.

54:37.808 --> 54:40.300
- Now, go.
- Okay.

54:44.248 --> 54:46.410
You know what? I took that last semester.

55:00.330 --> 55:02.356
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.

55:02.499 --> 55:05.663
New clothes?
- Yeah, I, uh, did my laundry.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.298
Doing laundry's a good look for you.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.613
Josh, right?

55:16.747 --> 55:18.716
Digging the vibe.

55:20.284 --> 55:21.809
Hey, Josh.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.183
See you in AP English.

55:24.421 --> 55:25.889
What?

55:43.674 --> 55:45.506
So...

55:47.644 --> 55:49.977
It's kind of nice having girls talk
to me for something

55:50.113 --> 55:52.639
other than help on their homework.

55:52.783 --> 55:53.910
Yeah.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.383
Wonton Wednesdays.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.215
The mathlete scavenger hunt
is on Saturday.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.220
Outstanding, I'm in. Josh?

55:59.356 --> 56:02.724
Um, Josh, nice haircut.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.989
That's it. Josh, you've been more MIA
than the final digit of pi.

56:06.129 --> 56:08.155
Then you show up with a fake-over.
What's going on?

56:08.398 --> 56:11.835
Relax, guys. It's just a new haircut
and some new shoes.

56:11.969 --> 56:13.562
Dylan thought it would be fun
for the documentary.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.203
When did the documentary get fun?

56:15.339 --> 56:18.207
Isn't it supposed to be
a hard-hitting exposé on the Populars?

56:18.342 --> 56:21.676
It will be. It's just Dylan turned out
to be more interesting than I thought.

56:21.812 --> 56:23.110
Losing focus, my friend.

56:23.247 --> 56:25.409
- First Amy Loubalu and now Dylan.
- What do you mean?

56:25.549 --> 56:28.883
Girls you have crushes on,
who are never, ever gonna date you.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.045
Okay, I don't have a crush on Dylan.

56:31.455 --> 56:33.424
Please. What and ever.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.253
Josh, what are you doing?

56:35.392 --> 56:36.951
Come on.

56:38.595 --> 56:41.690
We're on for Saturday, okay?
It's gonna be ridiculous.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.232
Lates.

56:44.601 --> 56:45.899
Ridiculous?

56:46.036 --> 56:47.368
Lates?

56:47.504 --> 56:49.132
It's like
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

56:49.273 --> 56:50.764
Directed by Philip Kaufman.

56:50.908 --> 56:55.039
Looks like Josh, but it acts like
it's morphed into a Popular.

56:57.814 --> 57:00.943
- Wow, Josh. You look...
- Adorkable.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.950
My handiwork, <i>naturellement.</i>

57:03.921 --> 57:05.048
Amy's sitting over there.

57:05.289 --> 57:08.054
And if you're so determined
to ask her out, you better do it now.

57:09.226 --> 57:10.888
- I'll save you a seat.
- Yeah?

57:11.695 --> 57:13.129
- Okay.
- Go.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.731
Here.

57:16.133 --> 57:18.693
So this is what you did all weekend
without us?

57:18.835 --> 57:20.133
Josh's makeover?

57:20.270 --> 57:22.603
No, we were filming too, but whatevs.

57:22.739 --> 57:24.537
You can make him over all you want.

57:24.675 --> 57:26.143
But he's still Count Dorkula.

57:27.077 --> 57:29.205
We're just saying.
You better watch it or...

57:29.346 --> 57:32.145
- Or what?
- Just or.

57:34.518 --> 57:37.317
Okay, look. Josh is strictly a brofriend.

57:37.587 --> 57:40.648
I figured if he's gonna hang around us,
then he might as well look the part.

57:41.558 --> 57:42.992
Thanks.

57:44.161 --> 57:46.323
When's this stupid dorkumentary over
anyway?

57:47.698 --> 57:49.030
You missed my game.

57:49.166 --> 57:50.429
I had to get my own water.

57:51.435 --> 57:53.267
Spring Formal is two weeks away.

57:53.537 --> 57:56.632
And once I'm Blossom Queen,
everything will go back to the way it was.

57:56.773 --> 57:58.503
Swears.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.832
My band, Blue Tangerine,
is playing a free show.

58:29.039 --> 58:30.598
Bring a friend?

58:30.741 --> 58:32.869
Actually, I was gonna ask you.

58:33.276 --> 58:35.040
Ask me to go to my own show?

58:35.178 --> 58:37.841
No, I was gonna ask you on a date.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.374
Really?

58:47.190 --> 58:49.284
How's Saturday? It's my day off.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.725
- Sounds great.
- Great.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.125
Cool.

59:05.409 --> 59:07.241
Josh Rosen.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.277
I'm Alan Schoenfield.
I just wanted to meet the young man

59:12.416 --> 59:14.749
my daughter's been spending
all of her time with.

59:14.885 --> 59:20.381
Oh, and I've never really approved
of that Asher kid, I mean, "Asher"?

59:20.524 --> 59:21.924
What kind of a name is Asher?

59:22.659 --> 59:26.323
- Actually, sir, Dylan and Asher are still...
- I like that you have a job.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.091
In my mall.

59:28.231 --> 59:30.097
What time do you get off work?

59:30.233 --> 59:33.670
Considering it is your mall, sir,
whenever you say.

59:33.804 --> 59:35.272
- You have dinner plans?
- No, sir.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.370
You do now.

59:42.345 --> 59:44.109
Okay.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.810
- Thanks for the ride.
- No prob.

59:49.953 --> 59:53.720
That outfit is gonna look so cute,
I'm so totally jealous.

59:53.857 --> 59:54.950
Oh, thanks.

59:56.293 --> 59:57.625
Bye.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:08.905
What?

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.809
But I can't believe
I've never seen this before.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.936
No? It's a classic.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:19.538
Now, what's with the rings of fire?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.712
They were created
by using two circular neon tubes.

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:26.824
And they were moved up and down
using elevator mechanics.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:30.121
Fritz Lang was most interested
in exploring the intersection

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.491
between magic and technology.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.064
- Should I be taking notes?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.962
It's like I entered an alternate universe.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.327
Oh, no, wait, worse,
an alternative alternate universe.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.462
Hey there, pumpkin.

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.872
Since you missed dinner with Amber
and me the other night,

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.501
I figured it was time
to meet this new boyfriend of yours.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.171
- Oh, and we got you turkey chowder.
- Dad.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.284
- What? It's your favorite.
- Josh is not my boyfriend, <i>d'accord?</i>

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.851
I tried to tell him that, Dyl.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.750
What is it with parents?

01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:59.914
We're just friends,
he's making my movie.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.752
My movie.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:05.056
And actually, sir, your daughter
helped me land a date for this Saturday.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:06.254
Oh, really?

01:01:09.566 --> 01:01:12.035
- Gross, Dad.
- What, that was barely a burp.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.536
Oh, yeah? Was that a challenge?

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.333
All right.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:28.018
- Men, so juvenile.
- Oh, you're just jealous.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.881
- Of what?
- Because you can't let loose.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.012
Oh, I've actually heard Dylan burp a lot.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.817
Dad. Mute button, please.

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:36.222
In fact, she used to like
to try to out-burp me

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.157
- so we'd have these contests. Uh-huh.
- No way.

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:39.354
That's classic.

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:40.828
I cannot believe you, Dad.

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:43.058
Yeah, I can barely believe it myself.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.862
Really? Okay, fine.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.027
You both wanna hear
what a burp really sounds like?

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.230
- Please.
- Okay.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.468
Here we go.

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:08.889
- Ah, bravo.
- Oh, the master has spoken.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:11.517
Thank you, thank you,
I'll be here all week.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.657
So your dad was really cool.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:19.429
I knew you two would get along.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.505
You both like
those old black-and-white movies.

01:02:22.639 --> 01:02:23.868
Classics.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:27.375
I can't believe he gave me the keys back
to my Dylish-mobile.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.672
Maybe he should think
you're my boyfriend more often.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.372
Ha, ha. Maybe he should.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:40.215
So you're, like, totally erasing
that footage of me burping tonight.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:42.358
Why? It's the real you.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:43.854
Real is overrated.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.863
I think I like the real Dylan
more than the cover story.

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:50.533
What and ever. Heh.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:53.227
So Amy.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.895
Where are you taking her
this weekend?

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:58.101
Uh, I haven't really thought about it yet.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.669
Do I have to do everything myself?

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.712
Okay, so Asher's having a party
this weekend.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.941
I can get you on the invite list. Done.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.379
I'm not sure that's my thing.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:12.580
- I know what girls like, remember?
- Yeah.

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:16.021
- Bye.
- Later.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.427
Some great stuff here, Josh.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.865
How's editing?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.969
Uh, I've just been crammed lately.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:28.128
Between shopping with Dylan
on Saturday

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:31.173
and she came over to my place
for dinner the other night.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.834
It's... Yeah, I'll get to it, okay?
I swear.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:38.415
Right, well, the film festival board needs
to approve the rough cut

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.244
two days before the festival.

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:43.353
I'm on top of it, Mr. F.
All right, I know what movie I wanna make.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.212
Good.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.181
Yeah.

01:03:57.734 --> 01:03:59.168
Hi.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:02.472
- Oh, here, listen to this.
- Okay.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:05.336
- It's Blue Tangerine's new demo.
- Okay.

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.843
- It's not for everyone.
- No.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.347
I could get used to it.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.123
So...

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:26.360
- Shall we go?
- Oh.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:28.692
Of course, yes. Right, sorry.

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:30.391
After you.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:36.567
So, what's the plan for today?

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.575
I was thinking if it's not too much
to ask on the first date,

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.077
- take you home, meet my mom?
- Oh.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.341
She's taking Greek cooking classes.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.280
She's making lamb kabobs for lunch.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:50.444
And I'm sure they're delish.
It's just that I'm a vegetarian.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:51.919
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.751
No, it's okay.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.325
Except when you're craving a burger.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:58.921
- How about a movie?
- Two hours in the dark?

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.621
On a day like this?

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:03.757
Okay, how about a party?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.232
At Asher Dumetz's place?

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:09.966
- You're friends with the volleyball dudes?
- No. Not at all.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.938
I'm glad we cleared that up because...

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.169
I don't know, I don't usually roll
with that crowd.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.505
Perfect.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:16.908
But should be fun for a laugh.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.412
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:19.777
All right.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.313
One second.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.717
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:31.056
Really?

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:47.236
Oh, wow.

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.141
Whoo!

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.786
Here we go.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.999
I'm coming.

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:23.211
Wanna dance? Wanna dance?

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.338
- What?
- Wanna dance?

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.179
I'm busy. Maybe later.

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:35.617
You're late.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.418
Wait, you invited us?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.587
Ugh. Oh, I knew Josh would have
nowhere hip to take you, so, yes.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:41.993
You can hang with Asher and me.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.863
I think I'd rather dance.

01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.782
Dancing isn't really my thing.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.445
Just go.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:26.739
Show-off.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.367
I'm happy to see Josh,

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:33.176
but I kind of wish he was on his own
so we could hang out more.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:34.879
Weird, right?

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.157
Okay, I'll stop torturing you.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.595
We got dates to the Spring Formal.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.857
With the twins.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.796
They're matching. I'm with Jay.

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:52.562
And I'm with Danny.

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.334
<i>Excellent</i>, ladies.
We can triple date, with Asher and me.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.465
Anyone thirsty?

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.944
What are you looking for?

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.451
- Lemonade.
- Oops.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.558
Took the last one.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.919
Get used to that loser feeling.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:24.928
So I was doing my guitar solo

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.469
and then an elephant joined in
on the drums.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.464
Wow, that's awesome.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.102
Go check on her.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.337
Wait, what?

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.447
Sorry, it's just...

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.979
It's fine.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.484
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.647
I'm gonna go see if the DJ
will let me spin a few.

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.388
Okay.

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:52.920
Hey.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.591
Why are you by yourself?

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh, I was just taking a breather.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.227
Where's Amy?

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.434
Okay, what's your deal
with her anyway?

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.541
Kind of ditched her in the sixth grade.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.471
Why? Amy's great.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.270
Amy is great.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.948
I was afraid of always living
in her shadow.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.442
You?

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.917
So I guess no threat of that
with Hannah and Lola.

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:25.622
Anyway, Amy's downstairs
checking out music.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.821
Uh-oh.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:29.862
- What "oh"?
- That means she's B-O-R-E-D, bored.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.796
Seriously? What should I do?

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.868
Be romantic, dork. Hold her hand.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.063
What, do I just grab it or...?

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.696
Like this.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:39.767
Then what?

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:42.469
Well, when she talks to you,
you wanna lean in.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:44.513
Like this.

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.911
- Hello?
- Uh...

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.550
- Uh...
- Uh...

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.923
Dylan had something in her contact.

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:56.185
You wear contacts?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.893
No, don't be silly. Contacts?

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.997
I have totes perfect vision.
Josh was just...

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.496
Yeah, just leaving.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.359
All right, who invited him anyway?

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.206
Asher, wait, nothing was happening.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.140
Asher.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.279
Asher.

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:23.818
Asher.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.285
Excuse me, sorry. Asher.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.356
Asher, wait.

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:29.354
Call you later, Ash.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:30.851
What's going on?

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.588
Oh, nothing, I'm just <i>très fatiguèe.</i>

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.325
- But you never leave parties early.
- Well, I am now, okay?

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:54.784
Look, there's nothing going on
with Dylan, okay?

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:57.619
I believe you.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.513
Um...

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.061
Would you wanna go
to the Spring Formal with me?

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.131
Thanks, Josh.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.858
But, no.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.298
Why not?

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.965
Look, I don't think
you're secretly dating Dylan.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.131
But I think you want to.

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:20.841
What?

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:23.037
Okay, N-O spells no.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.807
Never.

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.311
You even sound like her.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.444
I'm sorry.

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:34.590
Yeah.

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.927
<i>Now back away, go away.</i>

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.432
<i>And look.</i>

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:52.132
<i>And I'm free.</i>

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:56.375
<i>At the beach. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.435
No, no, no.

01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:38.311
No, no, no.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.786
No.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.060
No, no, no.

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.789
Here you go. Vote for Paterson.

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:52.401
Hi, guys, don't forget to vote.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.401
For Paterson.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.466
There you go.

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:58.632
Hello. Vote for Paterson.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.277
Okay, here you go,
you have to vote, okay?

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.813
Dylan, what are you doing?

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:13.683
Hannah and Lola.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:16.019
Duh, I'm standing right here.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.319
What's with the fire hydrant?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:23.856
Oh, I was just checking it.
You know, safety first.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:26.727
We don't have French class
until after lunch.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:32.739
Yeah. I was just gonna study
for the pop quiz.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.434
We have a pop quiz in French?

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:37.914
You never know, right?

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.175
Hi, Principal Guthrie.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.750
The pressures of Blossom Queen.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.946
It's made her totally snap.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:49.655
Look, I know the rough cut deadline
is tomorrow,

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.693
but is there any chance
I can get an extension?

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.230
I'd like to, but you know I can't, Josh.

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:58.494
As chair of the film committee,
it would look like I'm playing favorites.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.063
What's really going on?

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:04.037
Honestly? I need help finishing the film.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.801
Josh,

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.039
just tell the truth.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.373
Then your artistic vision
will shine through.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.444
Artistic vision. Got it.

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:22.321
Listen, I'll talk to the
film festival board.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:26.885
If you can edit something by tomorrow
morning, I'll get them to save your slot.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.892
But I'm afraid
you haven't given yourself enough time

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.730
to make something worthy of first place.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:36.800
He's right.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:41.775
The post-republican period
of the ancient Roman civilization

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:46.705
was characterized
by an autocratic government.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.978
An autocratic form of government.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:53.521
In the late third century AD,

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:57.252
Diocletian established the practice
of dividing an order between four...

01:14:57.393 --> 01:15:00.022
Here, a note from Asher.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.790
What does it say?

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:03.263
Oh, you know, the usual.

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.301
He adores me, et cetera, et cetera.

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:09.303
Actually, it says he's breaking up
with you. Like, now.

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.997
What?

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:14.777
You wear glasses?

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.475
This will all be on the midterm.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.446
Submit, submit.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.853
Asher.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.050
You look, Asher.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.490
- Asher, s...
- Dude.

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.520
- Asher.
- What?

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.689
You're breaking up with me in a note?

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.130
What about Spring Formal?

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.997
Maybe Josh can take you. Whoa!

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.502
What's that supposed to mean?

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.072
You've changed.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.299
You hang with nerds now.

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.704
You're even dressing like one.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:50.244
Oh, no. Look, look, see?
I'm the same old Dylan.

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.081
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:57.113
Lates.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:13.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:16.704
- I need to talk to you.
- Great. I need to talk to you too.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:17.898
Let's eat outside.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.100
No, that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:24.942
Okay, I can't have lunch with you today
or any day until after the film festival.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.239
What?

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:29.511
I haven't finished the movie yet.

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:31.746
Okay. And I gotta stay focused.

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:34.513
And I really, really wanna win
that film prize.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:36.888
And I really wanna win Blossom Queen.

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:38.995
So you better not mess this up,
geek, or I'll...

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:41.427
Or what?
You gonna ban me from The Ramp?

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.294
Your seat's already been taken.

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:21.931
<i>The Mummy</i>. Original or remake?

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:25.166
Original, directed by Karl Freund,
remake directed by Stephen Sommers.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.401
- I would say original.
- Remake.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:30.904
Well, look who deigned to join us.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.072
Well, as president of the film club,
I think that...

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.478
Not anymore.

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:36.245
What?

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:44.515
It's just you've been so busy going
to parties with the Populars lately...

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.425
Instead of coming
to the mathlete scavenger hunt.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:49.691
Guys, I am so sorry, okay?

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:50.959
I completely forgot.

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.803
Okay.

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:06.313
We decided to re-elect a new film club
society president in your absence.

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.610
- What? Who?
- Me.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.077
Really?

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:12.654
Why don't you go cry
on your new BFF's shoulder?

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:15.485
I heard Dylan and Asher
are D-O-N-E, done.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.058
He dumped her.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.160
Dare I ask?

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.703
How's it going?

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:34.338
My friends expect one thing
and Dylan expects another.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.707
Mr. Farley wants me to tell the truth.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:38.575
That's good advice.

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:44.552
Hey, Mom, do you think it's okay
if my artistic vision has changed?

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:50.190
Well, I mean, yeah, I think it's okay
if your feelings have changed.

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:54.894
I mean, your film should be about
the Dylan that you've come to know.

01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:00.326
Good night.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.402
Night.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:05.164
- Hey, don't stay up too late, okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:11.713
<i>Stop it.</i>

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:27.094
Testing, one, two, three.

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.932
I love it.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.273
It feels like a cupcake.

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:46.179
- What do you think about this one?
- It's so cute. I love the sparkles.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:48.614
- Do you like my glove?
- Oh, I love those.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.415
Dylan.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.613
What are you doing here?

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.891
This is my favorite boutique,
I'm always here.

01:19:57.026 --> 01:19:58.995
You're shopping
for Spring Formal without me?

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:02.425
Well, you're forever off shopping
with Josh these days.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:06.934
Besides, we have dates to the dance
and you don't anymore.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:25.917
Lola,

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:29.025
defs get that dress. You look gorgeous.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.138
Marta, I'm home.

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:44.331
Hey, sweetie.

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:45.907
No plans with Josh tonight?

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.943
- I think Josh and me are in a fight.
- Over the movie?

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:52.442
I'm starting to wonder
if it was such a stellar idea after all.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.608
Tell you what.

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:58.949
Why don't we have dinner,
just the two of us?

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:04.322
I was supposed to see Amber, but I can
quickly give her a call and cancel.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.224
We'll order in.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:09.491
I suppose your girlfriend can join us.

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:12.495
Just once.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.227
Really?

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:19.007
You are the best.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.738
I know.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:27.414
So I noticed that you have
some Serge Sanchez heels on.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.608
Oh, you noticed.

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:31.016
I love Serge so much.

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:33.452
Maybe you can borrow them.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.486
That would be awesome.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:39.153
So maybe Amber's not my mom,

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.323
but she's not so bad either.

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:45.467
And they convinced me
to have a little bit more faith in Josh.

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.763
The movie will be fine.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.629
Right?

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:04.950
As they say in show business,
break a leg.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.555
Wait, you guys still mad?

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.782
No. Geeks stick together.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.085
Hi.

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.934
Right.
Well, thank you, Josie Bel Bruno,

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.540
for that fascinating film
about your pet hamster.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:33.610
I certainly didn't know
that they were that vicious.

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:38.180
Right, well, I would like
to take this opportunity

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.655
to thank all the participants
in the festival, thank you.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.125
Well, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:51.129
to introduce Woodlands Academy's
official submission, Josh Rosen

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:54.794
and his documentary
called <i>The Popularity Project.</i>

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:04.871
<i>Popularity.</i>

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.572
<i>What is it?</i>

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.382
<i>According to Dylan Schoenfield,</i>

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:11.487
<i>one of the most popular girls</i>
<i>at Woodlands Academy,</i>

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.918
<i>it's a lot of things.</i>

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.354
<i>Being popular is so not easy.</i>

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:18.051
- We're in the movie.
<i>- It's like royalty or the first lady.</i>

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.662
<i>You have to live up</i>
<i>to impossible standards of beauty</i>

01:23:20.796 --> 01:23:22.788
<i>and you're expected</i>
<i>to be a good influence.</i>

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.991
<i>Like I help out the less fortunate.</i>

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.294
<i>Fashion victims.</i>

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:30.333
<i>Popularity's contagious.</i>

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.408
<i>What, like a cold?</i>
<i>- Duh.</i>

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.178
<i>It's why Hannah and Lola battle</i>
<i>to be my better friend.</i>

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:38.212
<i>Their popularity comes from mine.</i>

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.815
<i>What are your plans after school?</i>

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.818
<i>Uh, Pilates. But not on Tuesdays.</i>
<i>That's yoga.</i>

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.850
<i>I mean, when you graduate.</i>
<i>You know, hopes, dreams?</i>

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:52.962
<i>- What's your life goal?</i>
<i>- Blossom Queen.</i>

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:57.498
<i>After that.</i>
<i>- After?</i>

01:23:57.633 --> 01:24:02.128
<i>If I don't win Blossom Queen,</i>
<i>my life is officially O-V-E-R, over.</i>

01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:07.167
<i>So Populars only hang with Populars?</i>

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:09.335
<i>Cats don't hang with dogs, right?</i>

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.071
<i>Really? That's your argument?</i>

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:13.676
<i>It's better this way.</i>

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:17.149
<i>If everyone stays in their own group,
there's no chance of misunderstandings.</i>

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:20.348
<i>Like, what kind
of misunderstandings?</i>

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:23.152
<i>Well, take you and me, for instance.</i>

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.659
<i>If we mingled outside</i>
<i>of doing my movie together,</i>

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:28.787
<i>you might get the wrong idea</i>
<i>and ask me out.</i>

01:24:30.132 --> 01:24:33.000
<i>- Imagine the horror.</i>
<i>- You'd be so embarrassed.</i>

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.875
<i>Did we get it? Was that good?</i>

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:48.273
So is Dylan the cat or the dog?

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:56.650
<i>Are you getting my good side?</i>
<i>This one right here?</i>

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.556
<i>Could one person be this shallow?</i>

01:25:00.329 --> 01:25:04.289
<i>I chose Dylan as my documentary
subject because I wanted a challenge.</i>

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:07.028
<i>To uncover the truth
about popularity.</i>

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.002
<i>But I also wanted</i>
<i>to make something real.</i>

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:13.575
<i>I was determined to discover</i>
<i>the real Dylan Schoenfield.</i>

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:15.871
<i>Oh, no. The volleyball game's over.</i>
<i>Asher.</i>

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:23.814
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:36.665
Dylan, stop.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.426
Stop.

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:40.468
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:43.071
The entire movie is what's wrong.

01:25:43.205 --> 01:25:45.902
And it wasn't enough for you
to embarrass me in front of my friends.

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:48.101
You embarrassed me
in front of the entire city.

01:25:48.677 --> 01:25:49.736
Embarrass you?

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.403
But I was trying to show the real you.

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:54.141
And the real me is humiliating.

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.842
I've spent all of middle school
and high school

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.581
trying to get rid of the real me
and perfect the new Dylan.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.682
- Dylan, I...
- You don't get it and you never did.

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:07.654
I trusted you,
but you never cared about me.

01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:10.664
All you cared about
was that stupid movie.

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.631
- That's not true.
- It's not?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.073
Just leave me alone, Josh.

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:22.439
And by that, I mean for and ever.

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:40.758
<i>So the more I got to know Dylan, I
found out there's lots of sides to her.</i>

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:46.358
<i>She can be funny and normal</i>
<i>and full of life.</i>

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:48.265
<i>Josh, Josh, look at this.</i>

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:51.066
<i>Zoom in and look at it.
Josh, zoom in right here, right here. Look?</i>

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.142
<i>Zoom in. Do you see that?</i>
<i>What's that say?</i>

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:56.745
<i>What's that say?</i>

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:58.141
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.373
<i>A plus.</i>

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.983
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:05.978
<i>Yes. Stop it.</i>

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:17.664
<i>She can also be sensitive</i>
<i>and vulnerable and compassionate.</i>

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.861
<i>Is that your mom?</i>

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:24.029
<i>Yeah, she met my dad</i>
<i>at the Woodlands Spring Formal.</i>

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.231
<i>Crazy, huh?</i>

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.704
<i>Wait.</i>

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:30.403
<i>Was your mom Blossom Queen?</i>

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:34.912
<i>Back in the olden days, 1985. Heh.</i>

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.680
<i>Wow.</i>

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.878
<i>I bet you miss her.</i>

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.086
<i>Lots.</i>

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:47.592
<i>It gets kind of lonely here</i>
<i>with just me and my dad.</i>

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:53.498
<i>So when you said there's nothing more
to life than winning Blossom Queen...</i>

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.329
<i>Yeah,</i>

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.739
<i>because of my mom.</i>

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:02.377
<i>If I win,</i>

01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:05.140
<i>it's like we're still connected.</i>

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.547
<i>Like she's still with me.</i>

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.328
<i>And as I discovered</i>
<i>the real Dylan Schoenfield,</i>

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.198
<i>I figured, yeah, she
might be popular,</i>

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:32.239
<i>she might really like shoes,</i>
<i>but she's more than that.</i>

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:37.438
<i>She's smart and cool and real.</i>

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:39.946
<i>And that's the Dylan</i>
<i>I wanted to show the world.</i>

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:46.419
<i>Yeah, so maybe the truth didn't turn out
to be a hard-hitting exposé on popularity,</i>

01:28:46.555 --> 01:28:48.114
<i>but I don't care.</i>

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.688
<i>I have a new friend.</i>

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:52.154
<i>That's what really matters.</i>

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:12.208
<i>Are you ready?</i>

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:15.215
<i>Whoa. Here we go.</i>

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.042
<i>Whoa.</i>

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:22.819
Hey.

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:26.228
Still hidden under the frog planter,
like in middle school.

01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:28.355
What are you doing here?

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:33.191
Look, Dylan, just because you stopped
being my friend in sixth grade

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:35.304
doesn't mean I stopped being yours.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.399
I know you went through a lot
when your mom died.

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:43.535
I get it.

01:29:45.013 --> 01:29:46.504
I still get it.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:50.241
I don't know what to say.

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.483
Which, you know, for me,
never happens.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:05.056
Josh is worried about you.

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:07.896
Yeah, right.

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:10.767
Josh's terrible movie ruined me.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:13.933
My life is O-V-E-R, over.

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:17.344
Josh's terrible movie won
the film festival.

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:20.443
You're more popular than ever.

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:26.612
Josh gave me the DVD for his movie.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:30.283
Watch all of it
and then tell me if you're ruined.

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:17.830
Dylan.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:22.440
Dylan, you're the most popular girl
at Woodlands ever.

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:25.240
There you are. You don't have to hang
with the riff-raff anymore.

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.939
Look, I got the dress.

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.914
You're right, your charity is fashion.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:31.349
What and ever, it's nothing compared
to your dress, Dyl.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:34.285
Oh, vintage is so in. Like you.

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.856
Hey, Dylan.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:38.119
Looking, uh, smoking.

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:41.958
Dylan.

01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:44.464
If I could have your attention.

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:45.862
Oh, it's starting.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:47.993
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.532
It's time, people.

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:54.166
The moment I have...
The moment you have been all waiting for.

01:31:54.309 --> 01:31:58.770
It's time to announce
your Spring Formal Blossom Queen.

01:31:59.481 --> 01:32:01.279
And let's just see.

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:11.119
And the winner is:

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:14.489
Dylan Schoenfield.

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.432
Go. Go.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:31.508
Well played, Schoenfield. Well played.

01:32:32.814 --> 01:32:33.873
Whoo!

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.242
Woohoo!

01:32:51.466 --> 01:32:53.731
Recently, a documentary
was made about me

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.462
and I know some of you
may have seen it. Heh.

01:32:57.272 --> 01:32:58.365
Um...

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:01.340
I would like to give you all an update.

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:07.577
I was wrong about
that cats and dogs stuff.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:12.180
Popularity isn't about having everyone
know who you are or what you're wearing

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.519
or even winning Blossom Queen.

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:21.223
Popularity is about having real friends
who like you for you.

01:33:21.663 --> 01:33:24.895
Not faux ones who ditch you
because a better offer came along

01:33:25.033 --> 01:33:28.526
or bailed on you
because you became single

01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:31.731
and didn't have a date
to Spring Formal anymore.

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.408
It's about real friends.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.435
Who you can count on.

01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:40.879
Even if it's been, like, forever
and they have pink hair and stuff.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:50.080
Friends who might not always be
into the same things as you,

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:51.420
but who will always be there

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:54.996
to share an
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae.

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:00.891
It's not about being popular or a geek.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.933
It's about being around people
who make you happy,

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.311
Like how I feel about Josh Rosen.

01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:42.838
Oh.

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.309
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:46.514
You won the film festival.

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:48.315
And you won Blossom Queen.

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.308
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:34:50.485 --> 01:34:51.544
Same here.

01:34:52.587 --> 01:34:53.987
Amy showed me the whole movie.

01:34:54.122 --> 01:34:57.024
Oh, you finally called it "the movie."

01:34:57.759 --> 01:34:58.988
Our movie.

01:34:59.394 --> 01:35:02.523
So does it have a happy ending?

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.627
You tell me.

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.448
True love prevails.

01:35:23.585 --> 01:35:24.678
Gross.

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:27.550
I think it's kind of romantic.

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.687
You wanna dance, Steven?

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:35.923
- Does E equal MC...
- Squared?

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.838
- Hi.
- Hi. Heh.

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:47.772
- Wanna dance?
- Huh?

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:51.170
What? Are you scared or something?

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:53.438
Me? Scared?

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:23.906
So that's our story.

01:36:24.045 --> 01:36:25.809
The princess and the geek.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.939
Film geek.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.775
I'm sorry I called you a nerd.

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:33.319
Sorry I called you a diva.

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:47.096
So I'm thinking, sequel?

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:49.033
Sequels are never
as good as the original.

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.298
Everyone knows that.
