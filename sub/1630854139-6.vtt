WEBVTT

00:03.160 --> 00:04.960
Ah!

00:06.360 --> 00:09.280
Well, that's the end of that, then.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.240
Old place had a good innings,
I suppose. Hmm.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.440
The question is, what now?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.520
Mike!

00:48.520 --> 00:50.920
Mike, we did it.
We did it. We're five stars.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.400
What? You're joking. Look!

00:53.400 --> 00:55.200
Oh, you're joking. What?

00:55.200 --> 00:57.600
Well, that's still four stars.
No, no, look, look.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.920
There's one yellow pixel inside
the fifth star.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.280
"Which means with an average review
score of 4.13,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.480
"you have officially attained
mega-host status."

01:05.480 --> 01:08.520
We're mega-hosts. We actually
did it! We're 5-star hoteliers.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.480
Yeah. Well, we're actually 4.1 star
bed-and-breakfastiers.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.880
Same thing. Yeah. Same thing.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.680
I was thinking to celebrate,
we could go out and get...

01:16.680 --> 01:17.960
Wasted!

01:17.960 --> 01:22.880
OK. I was going to say new chairs
for in here.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.320
OK, well, no offence to you,
my wife,

01:25.320 --> 01:29.400
but my idea is brilliant
and your idea is terrible.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.000
I know, I know.
I know, but look at these.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.680
They don't exactly scream
country house.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.160
There's more chairs in the shed.
Yes, OK.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.520
And of course nothing says
five stars like shed chairs.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.760
But I've been browsing and these
are at an auction in Halliton.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.560
Oh, no, they are gorgeous.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.520
I love all that delicate
scroll work on the...

01:49.520 --> 01:51.000
You wanna go to the auction?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.120
Yeah, so bad.
I'm going to give it all this.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.320
All right. The estimate's 20 each,

01:56.320 --> 01:59.080
so no more than 100
for all four, OK?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.320
Is this our marriage now?

02:10.960 --> 02:13.360
Ooh, new game.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.040
Ooh.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.400
Not again!

02:32.800 --> 02:35.360
Ah! Were I alive... No.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.520
I was going to say I'd help you
make the bed.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.720
Ooh.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.960
More bookings.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.160
That extra star makes all
the difference.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.880
Yes!

02:47.880 --> 02:49.160
I don't know what you mean.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.920
Oh, come on. There's a woman here
who said, under requests,

02:51.920 --> 02:53.400
"Looking forward to our stay.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.160
"Please arrange kennels
for four Afghan hounds."

02:56.160 --> 02:58.880
I am outraged on your behalf.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.120
Crumbs, they're all at it.
"What speed is the Wi-Fi?"

03:02.120 --> 03:04.360
"Hypoallergenic pillows, please."

03:04.360 --> 03:06.320
"We would like vegan breakfast"?!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.600
Oh, no actually,
OK, that is actually fair enough.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.840
Where is "Vega"?
What do they eat?

03:10.840 --> 03:13.800
No meat, no fish,
no dairy, no eggs.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.760
Those poor souls.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.440
You're back.
Did you get the chairs?

03:21.440 --> 03:23.920
No, sorry. They went up to 130.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.800
So I did one of those.
Which they also thought was a bid,

03:26.800 --> 03:30.600
But then someone went to 140
and I stayed really still.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.160
Oh, that's a shame. Well, I'll try
the ones in the shed.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.520
Yeah, yeah. But, but...

03:34.520 --> 03:36.360
I didn't come home empty handed. Oh.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.920
Bear with me.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.480
No, so, I was saying "bear with me"

03:57.480 --> 04:00.040
because there's literally...

04:00.040 --> 04:01.520
A bear with me.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.080
I bought a bear.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.960
You really did.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.520
Fine, fine.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.240
Well, let's just call Birthmark Club
a partial success.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.440
Is bear in Breakfast Room!

04:13.440 --> 04:17.160
And I shall follow up on that rumour
on Lady B later.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.000
Left buttock.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.120
There's a bear in
the Breakfast Room.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.160
What?!

04:22.160 --> 04:25.920
Oh, interesting. A bear?
Very exciting... A real life bear?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.520
...for people with legs.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.400
It was a bargain. Guess how much.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.760
200 quid?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.680
Oh, could you...
Could you guess a bit more?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.800
Mike. It's terrifying.
It's a talking point.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.880
Oh, yeah. "Have you seen the giant
bear, darling?"

04:37.880 --> 04:39.320
"Yeah, it put me off my breakfast."

04:39.320 --> 04:41.480
Rubbish. It just needs,
like, sprucing up, you know?

04:41.480 --> 04:44.120
I'm telling you,
this thing is sick. What?

04:44.120 --> 04:47.920
Sick? I think it might be dead.
Should someone tell him?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.800
Er, no, he doesn't literally
mean sick, Kitty.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.000
It's a sort of American
street slang.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.840
You know, you say
something negative,

04:55.840 --> 04:58.160
when you mean
something positive.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.000
So one might say "Oh, man,
this modular hi-fi system is bad!"

05:02.000 --> 05:04.520
When really you mean it's
terribly good.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.080
So the opposite.
Er, sort of, yeah.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.720
Like when the Captain say
that you're morally bankrupt?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.640
Er... ye-eees.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.360
Ha. Wow. Haa.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.600
Do you like it?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.400
Oh, I think it's... bad.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.840
Yeah, OK. Good, me too.
Very, very bad.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.240
Well, try telling Mike that.
Oh, I would if I could.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.720
Morally bankrupt, eh?
I'm sorry?

05:29.720 --> 05:35.200
A little dicky bird tells me
you think I'm morally bankrupt.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.360
That's right.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.520
What?
We all do. What's that?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.680
Julian. Morally bankrupt.
Oh, Good Lord, yes.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.720
You can be a little, uh...

05:45.720 --> 05:49.240
Oh, right.
Thought you might try and deny it.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.000
Oh, I assumed you knew. You know,
because of everything you do.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.920
And say. Well, quite.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.560
Well. I'm no bleeding heart liberal.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.080
But I do care about things.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.560
People.
You know, I like to, erm...

06:03.560 --> 06:05.880
...help.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.920
He almost done me there.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.840
Oh, very good. Carry On.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.640
Oh, dear. So was it in a cage?
No, it was on the stage. What?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.480
Hey. I'm calling him Bear Grills.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.360
But Grills spelt like how you cook
a breakfast.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.240
Mike, the bear has to go.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.000
It's ugly and it's scary and it's
going to freak out the guests.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.040
Well, I disagree, so...

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
We've just clawed our way
to five stars,

06:33.040 --> 06:35.920
I'm not risking that
for some filthy animal.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.360
Me or the bear? Mike!

06:38.360 --> 06:40.840
Why is it that when it comes to
the running our business,

06:40.840 --> 06:43.720
my opinion seems to mean nothing?
That's not true.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.400
It's just you have a history of
buying mad stuff. Like what?

06:47.400 --> 06:49.880
Like the "Butt Ho" hoodie,
like the inflatable suits,

06:49.880 --> 06:51.440
like the giant bear.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.280
Well, at least I do stuff. Yeah?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.480
I don't just sit around all day
talking to my dead mates.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.160
Oh, sit around? Mike,
I do the books,

06:58.160 --> 07:00.600
I do the check-ins,
the adverts, the running repairs.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.560
And now I have to sort out all of
the chairs,

07:02.560 --> 07:04.880
and devise a five-star
vegan breakfast.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.360
Fine. I'll do the breakfast.
But the bear stays.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.920
Er, are you joking?
It stays.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.520
Not in here it doesn't. Ugh!

07:12.520 --> 07:14.080
Fine.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.280
"Ooh, look at me, I'm Alison.
I do everything."

07:32.280 --> 07:34.280
Well we'll see about that.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.240
Ah. Veg-ann? Vegan.
What?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.720
No meat, no fish, no dairy.
Oh, right.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.200
Good luck to them, I say.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.720
Can't be easy going cold turkey on
luncheon meat and Billy Bear ham.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.360
And eggs. You what?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.480
Alison said they don't eat eggs.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.480
What's wrong with 'em?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.080
I mean, what they having
with their chips?

08:03.080 --> 08:05.080
What are they dipping their
soldiers in?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.960
What they putting on top
of their gammon?

08:06.960 --> 08:09.000
They wouldn't have gammon.
Don't change the subject!

08:09.000 --> 08:10.840
What's wrong with eggs?
Nothing's wrong with eggs.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.240
Then why won't you let me have 'em?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.960
I am not saying that,
I'm just telling you.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.840
A man needs eggs to sustain himself!

08:15.840 --> 08:18.160
Well, fascinating.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.560
Vegan. Vegans.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.000
Veg-an? Veg, Ve-gans.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.240
Hey! Hey. Robin.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.880
What on earth are you doing
in there?

08:28.880 --> 08:31.280
Has it gone? Bear?

08:32.320 --> 08:36.000
Well, of course it's not gone. Ohh.
It can't go anywhere.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.720
It's just a big lump of sawdust
and fur.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.680
Honestly, what's the matter
with you?

08:42.680 --> 08:45.120
It just remind me of...

08:45.120 --> 08:47.760
...very bad day.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.960
Oh. Uh.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.000
Uhh?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.720
Uh!

09:11.720 --> 09:13.240
Uh-yuh?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.400
Nuh-muh. Huh?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.280
Lah, "Wahhh!"

09:20.240 --> 09:21.640
Yuh!

09:44.800 --> 09:46.120
Wuh?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.480
Um-deh...

10:07.560 --> 10:09.480
Huh?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.720
Yaaaa!

10:21.960 --> 10:23.960
Oh! I know.

10:23.960 --> 10:29.880
Oh, I have never seen such
a tasteless, mangy looking...

10:29.880 --> 10:32.240
Oh, it's a Gerrard.
A what?

10:32.240 --> 10:37.080
Gerrard & Sons. The undisputed
masters of taxidermy.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.520
They're the chaps who did Dante
for me. Oh.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.320
Oh, yes, yes. Now look at
the detail, Alison.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.760
Do you see how they've gathered the
hide into the pinch of the anus?

10:48.760 --> 10:50.400
Oh, OK. OK.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.080
I'm going to just go and think about
that sentence, forever. Tremendous.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.040
It just, uh, sawdust and fur.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.440
That's the spirit.
That's the spirit.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.600
Nothing but sawdust and fu...

11:07.600 --> 11:09.360
Huh?

11:13.720 --> 11:16.480
Oh, dear. No, no, no,
that won't do.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.000
That won't do at all.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.880
Are you OK, Fanny?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.480
Anything I can HELP you with?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.720
Ah, well, it's the eye, you see.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.240
The left one.
His gaze is all askew.

11:28.240 --> 11:33.960
So it is. Well, let's see what we
can do with the old magic finger.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.680
Very well.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.920
Where bear?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.520
Oh...

11:46.360 --> 11:50.400
Oh, yes, pin's just
a little jammed in here.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.160
Oh, yes, yes, that's much better.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.480
Thank you, Julian.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.760
Not at all, happy to HELLLP.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.680
But what sort of craft?
Upcycling.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.120
Sounds exhausting. Yeah, well,
Mike blew all of our chair money,

12:34.120 --> 12:38.680
so we just have to make do
and mend. Ah, yes, there they are.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.320
Ah, OK.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.080
Well, not exactly five-star.

12:44.080 --> 12:49.160
What do you think?
Hmmm. They do look pretty...

12:49.160 --> 12:51.360
..."good"? Yeah?

12:51.360 --> 12:55.200
Well, the condition's
just "wonderful".

12:55.200 --> 12:59.280
And the legs are
all "sturdy".

13:00.400 --> 13:02.920
Hmmm. Maybe they're not so bad.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.600
Yes. Not BAD at all.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.840
OK, well, let's give it a go.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.400
You're shooting the messenger.
And I hate being shot.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.360
Well, then answer the question -
why can't I have my egg?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.280
I don't know.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.880
I suppose it's more about
the chicken than the egg.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.520
You what?

13:25.520 --> 13:28.880
Well, if only lady chickens
lay eggs,

13:28.880 --> 13:33.480
then what do you suppose happens
to all the boy chickens?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.520
Well, I suppose they all just go off

13:36.520 --> 13:39.240
into a field together.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.480
Or a nice barn until they get old.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.360
Do you think that's
what happens?

13:46.360 --> 13:48.160
No.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.800
Hang on. What the heck is aquafaba?

13:50.800 --> 13:53.520
Oh, I'm going to have to go to
the shops.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.360
All those little chicks.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.040
Makes you think, doesn't it?
Really does.

14:07.440 --> 14:11.400
Ehh. And crisis averted.

14:11.400 --> 14:15.640
No, no, don't mention it.
I'm happy to help...

14:17.080 --> 14:18.880
Well, what's the point in being virtuous

14:18.880 --> 14:20.720
if there's no-one to witness it?

14:22.240 --> 14:24.400
Well, you're no good.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.920
Oh, come on!

14:38.200 --> 14:43.880
Erm... Fire? Someone? Anyone?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.480
Well, you're no good.
Keys, keys, keys. Ah.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.800
Who put...?

14:51.800 --> 14:55.120
So, that's how we're playing,
is it? Fine.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.320
Oh.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.920
All right. Come on, mate.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.160
Yeah. Rub it in.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.520
Ooh. That would work. Yeah?

15:10.520 --> 15:11.920
Honestly, Alison.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.760
I thought these were GOOD
when we found them,

15:14.760 --> 15:17.920
but that looks so, SO BAD.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.640
Well, thank you for your honesty.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.120
There. Pride of place.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.320
Whoa.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.600
There.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.000
Come on. Pull self together.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.720
You just tired.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.360
And dead.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.880
Dead tired.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.680
There nothing to be scared of.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.680
Hey.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Hmm. Right, shop.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.840
Like I'm not already doing
everything round here.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.240
Oh.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.960
No. No. No. No. No. Mike?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.720
Come on.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.400
There's a bear.
There's a big bear. Huge bear.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.600
What's he say?
Said he saw a bear... bear...

17:40.440 --> 17:42.840
What did it look like, then? Eh?

17:42.840 --> 17:44.800
This bear you saw. Up there.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.200
It look like bear.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.000
Well, yeah, but what, brown bear,
grizzly bear, Kodiak bear?

17:49.000 --> 17:53.120
I don't know. If you see bear in
house, probably right bear.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.480
No offence, but what are you scared
of? You're already dead.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.560
So is bear.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.640
He's got a point. Oh, look, if I
could just be the voice of reason

18:02.640 --> 18:04.440
for a moment. Here she goes.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.920
As there hasn't been any dead bear
attacks in this house

18:06.920 --> 18:09.920
in the last 600 years,
I'm going to go out on a limb

18:09.920 --> 18:13.200
and say one is probably not about
to come crashing down the stairs.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No. No.
It's Alison. It's Alison.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.120
It's not even a bear. Not a bear.
It's not a bear.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.720
It's not a bear - it's Alison.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.480
What's she bringing
that down here for?

18:32.480 --> 18:34.160
I know, I know, it's awful.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.600
But can...

18:35.600 --> 18:38.000
It's just until Mike
forgets about it.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.920
Fine. Put it with the rest.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.360
Thanks, guys.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.920
Thanks.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.640
There you are.
Are we still doing our craft?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.520
Yeah, yeah,
I just got a bit waylaid.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.480
I'll tell you what, it's pretty big,
isn't it? It's massive.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.760
I think it's SICK.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.400
Let's hope it's not contagious.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.800
Still too soon?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.920
All right. Back to craft club.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.720
Spending all this time together.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.320
It's awful and I HATE it.

19:24.320 --> 19:29.040
What? Ah, now, I might be able to
explain what's going on there.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.720
See, I may have mentioned,
in passing,

19:31.720 --> 19:34.360
that American youths now use
the word "bad"

19:34.360 --> 19:36.160
to describe something "good."

19:36.160 --> 19:39.480
Don't know if you've seen the LP
by the popular recording artist

19:39.480 --> 19:41.160
Michael Jackson?

19:41.160 --> 19:44.440
Erm... Anyway, seems Kitty has
rather taken the idea

19:44.440 --> 19:45.680
and run with it.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.760
Oh, right. Yeah, OK.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.960
Oh, that explains a lot.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Julian.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.800
Oh, no, no, HAPPY TO HELP.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.640
SPREAD THE WORD! Mm?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.400
Ha.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
We're going to find her... Outside.
...and I tell you what...

20:02.400 --> 20:06.560
Ah, Alison. Glad we caught you.
Do you have any eggs in the house?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.960
I'm busy, Pat, and I don't like you
watching me eat.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.720
No, no, we want you to get rid of them.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.960
And any meat. Why?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.600
Because it's murder, Alison.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.120
Yeah. So we're giving it up,
aren't we? Mm-hm.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.280
You already gave it up.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.680
I mean, you've given up eating
everything. Oh!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.720
What you really want is for me
to give it up.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.160
No, this is not about you, Alison.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.960
This is about all those little animals.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.320
Innocent creatures.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.760
Chickpea water. Vegan breakfast.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.680
Right on, brother!

20:36.680 --> 20:38.080
What the...?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.800
Right, this isn't a game.
Where's my bear?

20:39.800 --> 20:42.760
Firstly, "where's my bear?" sounds
like a game. KITTY: Alison, come on!

20:42.760 --> 20:45.000
And secondly, I've put it somewhere
more appropriate.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.480
And don't bother trying to find it,

20:46.480 --> 20:48.280
cos you're never going to guess
where it is...

20:48.280 --> 20:50.400
In the cellar with my other stuff. No.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.960
No. Mike, wait. Just leave it.
Just leave it.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.400
It's tacky and ugly and it'll upset
my guests. Our guests.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.360
I bust a gut for this place just as
much as you do,

20:58.360 --> 21:00.440
I ask for one little thing
and you're acting like...

21:00.440 --> 21:01.760
It's a huge thing!

21:01.760 --> 21:04.520
It's a huge, ugly, snarling thing

21:04.520 --> 21:07.760
and I don't want it anywhere
in this house.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.920
Fine. Fine? Fine.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.080
Fine!

21:18.440 --> 21:20.640
Where is it? Where's Gerrard?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.280
Oh, he lives in the cellar now.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.880
What?! No! No, no, no.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.320
He should be out on display.
He's magnificent.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.320
Yes, he's totally ghastly.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.840
How dare you?! He's a masterpiece.

21:30.840 --> 21:35.680
I agree. He makes me want to do
a sick in my mouth.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.720
Kitty, you appear to be talking at

21:37.720 --> 21:40.040
slightly cross purposes
with... yourself.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.040
No, no. Julian explained that
young people today say

21:43.040 --> 21:44.760
the opposite of what they mean.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.680
Kitty, listening
to Julian is seldom a wise idea.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.960
You have a wonderful grasp
of the King's English

21:51.960 --> 21:54.840
and it would avoid a great deal
of confusion if you would revert

21:54.840 --> 21:57.760
to using it in
the traditional manner.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.040
Yes. Perhaps that's a... good idea.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.920
Yes, much better.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.520
Come on, then, Kitty.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.640
Coming!

22:09.320 --> 22:11.000
There we go.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.800
What do you think?

22:13.800 --> 22:17.520
I think it's garish and vulgar.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.320
Thank you, Kitty.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.120
"I don't want it anywhere
in this house!"

22:26.120 --> 22:30.760
I'll get it out of the house,
all right.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.880
It's all in your head. It's all in
your head. It's in your head.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.040
Argh! Argh!

22:38.040 --> 22:40.400
Oh! Oh!

22:40.400 --> 22:42.040
Why he get so close?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.040
Hang on.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.560
How dead bear attack live man?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.960
Oh, that's right, buddy.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.000
We're putting the B in B&B.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.440
To the gatehouse.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.320
You so silly sometimes.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.120
Oh...

24:17.000 --> 24:19.480
Oh, no, no, no, don't get it wet.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.680
Don't get it wet.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.440
You have got to be kidding me.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.520
What the hell is he...?

24:48.280 --> 24:49.680
Mike!

24:52.680 --> 24:54.240
Mike!

24:54.240 --> 24:56.800
Get away from the tree!

25:17.080 --> 25:19.240
Come on, then!

25:33.480 --> 25:35.520
Ah...

25:35.520 --> 25:37.560
Whoa.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.160
Mike!

25:45.640 --> 25:47.280
Alison...

25:52.320 --> 25:53.760
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry... I...

25:55.760 --> 25:58.440
Let's get back to the house.
Wait, the bear.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.360
Good.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.000
I thought lightning never strikes...

26:06.000 --> 26:07.240
Oh!

26:08.800 --> 26:09.840
Oh...

26:22.000 --> 26:23.880
That's the end of that, then.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.480
Old place had a good innings,
I suppose.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.960
The question is, what now?

26:31.960 --> 26:36.000
Yeah. What now?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.920
I guess we put in a claim,
get some quotes.

26:39.920 --> 26:43.920
Rebuild, reopen.
Or we could, you know...

26:43.920 --> 26:45.440
...not.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.960
Not what?

26:46.960 --> 26:49.720
We worked so hard
to make this five stars,

26:49.720 --> 26:53.400
and for what? Even more work,
even more stress,

26:53.400 --> 26:55.240
and us at each other's throats.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.840
Yeah, that was about the bear.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.520
The bear was about the gatehouse.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.320
Yeah.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.720
This was supposed to be
the easy bit.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.520
Imagine the hotel. Yeah.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.280
What will we do for money?

27:10.280 --> 27:12.680
Honestly, I have no idea.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.160
Hmm...

27:26.360 --> 27:28.360
Well, it's not exactly a bear, but...

27:28.360 --> 27:30.360
No, no, it's wonderful.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.760
Yeah, I prefer the duck.

27:32.760 --> 27:36.200
Do you see how the down tucks into
the posterior crevice?

27:36.200 --> 27:40.160
Now that is the hallmark of
a true Gerrard. Wonderful.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.400
Yeah, can't believe you found
another Gerrard.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.440
I didn't. It's just the duck from
the library,

27:45.440 --> 27:47.920
I just took the name plate
from the bear and stuck it on.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.200
Very resourceful. Yeah.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.360
Fraudulent, but resourceful.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.160
Well, it was Julian's idea.

27:53.160 --> 27:58.160
Well, if it puts a smile on their
faces, I'm happy to help.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.800
There's a heart in there somewhere.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.480
Reminds me of the time I sent
an actual pig's heart,

28:02.480 --> 28:05.400
in a box,
as a threat to a journalist.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.560
And there he is.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.440
Right. Boiled eggs for you. Yes!

28:09.440 --> 28:11.960
The murderer.
Beautiful murderer.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.240
And for me, Mike's vegan scramble.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.720
For which no chickens died, and it's
absolutely delic...

28:18.720 --> 28:20.720
Urgh.

28:20.720 --> 28:25.600
Oh, I think my aquafaba was
a bit heavy on the aqua.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.200
Well, five stars for effort.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.720
Mike... Mike.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.200
Yeah? Yeah.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.360
Mm!

28:37.400 --> 28:39.080
Ooh...

28:39.080 --> 28:41.520
I suppose, when you think about it,

28:41.520 --> 28:45.640
most people in this house haven't
eaten an egg in decades.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.080
Centuries. Yeah.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.920
And you could argue that, well,
we've done our bit

28:50.920 --> 28:54.160
as a household, and that perhaps

28:54.160 --> 28:58.160
the occasional egg could be
forgiven?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.480
To whatever comes next.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.800
To whatever's next.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.760
Huh-huh-huh...
I'm not dipping it again. Ooh!
