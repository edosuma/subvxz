WEBVTT

00:10.458 --> 00:12.500
(male #1 on TV)
'4-13 is in.'

00:14.917 --> 00:17.083
(male #2 on TV)
'We copy you down, Eagle.'

00:17.166 --> 00:20.750
(male #1 on TV)
'Houston, uh,
Tranquility Base here.'

00:20.834 --> 00:21.917
'The Eagle has landed.'

00:37.250 --> 00:39.458
You just missed the moon
landing you little
troglodyte.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.250
Get out of here, Laura.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.667
Don't have a spaz.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.875
I don't care about your
stupid toy, Danny boy.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.917
It's not a toy.
Get out.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.500
Why don't
you get
out?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.291
You haven't left the
house in three days.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.625
- Mom! Laura's bothering me.
- Mom sent me.

00:53.709 --> 00:55.125
Personally I could care less

00:55.208 --> 00:57.834
'if you stay a friendless
goober your whole life.'

00:57.917 --> 01:00.959
'Hello?
Earth to Danny..'

01:06.041 --> 01:09.208
Wow, he's leaving the house!
Hold on. Let me get a
picture.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.291
Detective McAvoy, Lilly Rush.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.583
A retired detective.
Just Mack, now.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.375
Well, you said you got
something for me to look at?

02:11.458 --> 02:14.375
Yeah, couple days ago guy comes
into the Fairmount Station.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.583
- Drops this off.
- 'Some kind of model rocket?'

02:16.667 --> 02:18.959
Yeah, he found it up near
the bluffs over the
Wissahickon.

02:19.041 --> 02:22.000
Some, uh, civilian desk
jockey processed it

02:22.083 --> 02:24.125
and didn't even bother ID'ing
the guy who brought it in.

02:24.208 --> 02:26.458
Yeah, civilian humps
doing cops' work.

02:26.542 --> 02:28.208
Yeah, take a look here.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.709
'"The Chestnut Hill Rocket
Boys
launched this vehicle'

02:32.792 --> 02:37.667
"July 20, 1969 AD in
peace for all mankind."

02:37.750 --> 02:39.333
Signed "Danny Finch."

02:39.417 --> 02:42.000
Day after we landed on the moon

02:42.083 --> 02:45.709
Danny Finch's body turns
up in the Schuylkill.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.250
'He was 12-years-old.'

02:47.333 --> 02:49.834
That was my first
year in Homicide.

02:49.917 --> 02:51.417
Tough way to start out.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.041
Yeah, tough on the family.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.083
Any suspects?

02:54.166 --> 02:55.834
Scumbag Reggie Blunt.

02:55.917 --> 02:57.667
He got popped for
a laundry list of murders

02:57.750 --> 02:59.041
around the
city
that year.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.083
And the DA lumped my
kid's case in with
them.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.583
Never got a conviction

03:02.667 --> 03:05.250
but everybody was sure
he did it, except me.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.917
Talk to Danny's friends
back in the day?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.417
'No, he didn't have any.'

03:08.500 --> 03:10.917
Boy was a loner, you
know,
science nerd type.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.583
Blunt went down
for the other
murders

03:12.667 --> 03:15.750
and Brass said there was
no more meat on the
bones.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.000
He pushed me
to move on.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.291
This gives you
something to chew on.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.917
Yeah, this
rocket
was in the park

03:21.000 --> 03:24.083
'two miles upstream from
where the body was found.'

03:24.166 --> 03:26.417
I interviewed all the
kids
in the neighborhood.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.083
I got nothing.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.667
But this makes me think that..

03:30.750 --> 03:33.333
...maybe he did have
some friends after
all.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.667
- These Rocket Boys.
- I don't know, Mack.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.917
A toy rocket's a tough
sell with the bosses.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.792
I've been 39 years
turning over in my
sleep

03:40.875 --> 03:42.709
what could have
happened to this
kid.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.750
You have any idea what
that
does to you, detective?

03:47.834 --> 03:50.333
No one else around here
will give me the time of
day.

03:50.417 --> 03:53.625
And I hear you take
cases nobody else
will.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.834
You find this
kid's
murderer..

03:57.125 --> 03:59.583
...maybe I can
get
to sleep again.

04:02.834 --> 04:05.166
Rocket Boys, huh?

04:05.250 --> 04:07.375
Yeah, you think
I'm crazy, huh?

04:08.542 --> 04:10.500
I don't think
you're crazy, Mack.

04:47.125 --> 04:50.542
This baby is a freaking
marvel. Check it out.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.041
Custom-machined, high-grade
chrome nickel washer.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.542
(Lilly)
'A 12-year-old kid built
this?'

04:55.625 --> 04:57.041
Get it to Evidence,
see if they can lift

04:57.125 --> 04:58.542
any prints inside the cylinder.

04:58.625 --> 04:59.959
Pretty skimpy box on this kid.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.625
You sure your boyfriend
did all his homework?

05:01.709 --> 05:03.041
Blunt gets credit
for the murder

05:03.125 --> 05:05.417
suddenly Mack's
strong-armed to move on.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.375
Blunt gets shanked
in Graterford in '78.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.709
He knew anything about it,
he took it to his grave.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.709
Old crackpot Mack.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.458
Oh, you knew him, boss?

05:14.542 --> 05:15.834
He was in homicide when
I was still walking

05:15.917 --> 05:17.959
a beat in Fishtown.
He's a good cop.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.875
Bosses thought he cared
a little too much.

05:19.959 --> 05:23.709
Autopsy report's got Danny with
abrasions on the face and body

05:23.792 --> 05:25.542
'a cracked skull,
blunt-force trauma.'

05:25.625 --> 05:27.834
Kid got banged up pretty bad.

05:27.917 --> 05:31.709
Aw, Chestnut Hill
Chemistry Award, 1968.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.500
I didn't even know they
had chemistry in 6th grade.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.375
Danny's sister Laura
is in with Jeffries now.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.542
See if she knows anything
about this rocket.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.917
Or the Chestnut Hill
Rocket Boys.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.542
Can I smoke in here?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.542
[chuckles
]
Uh, no.

05:50.709 --> 05:53.917
Sorry. I thought police
station, you know, maybe.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.333
Not unless you're
planning on confessing.

05:57.417 --> 06:01.667
[sighs]
I lost my baby brother the day
they put a man on the moon.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.333
I still can't look at it
without thinking about him.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.625
You two were close?

06:05.709 --> 06:07.917
I was pretty awful
to him, actually.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.917
It breaks my heart now.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.667
At that age,
you just don't think.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.417
Danny say where
he was going that
day?

06:13.500 --> 06:14.834
He never told
me anything.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.583
He sort of holed up
in the science.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.041
'Skipped a grade
when he was eight'

06:19.125 --> 06:22.125
ended up in my class.
Drove me crazy.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.834
We found this up in the park.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.375
Danny's name on it.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.667
Know anything about it?

06:26.750 --> 06:28.083
Math, science, chemistry.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.709
He was more about equations
than this sort of thing.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.625
What about a Chestnut
Hill Rocket Boys club?

06:33.709 --> 06:36.125
Danny in a club? No way.

06:36.208 --> 06:40.458
But...the week
before he died..

06:40.542 --> 06:44.125
...I saw him with some boys
from the neighborhood.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.375
Right, right here.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.458
- Alright, perfect.
- Okay.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.667
'Perfect.'

06:51.750 --> 06:55.250
Neil Armstrong readies the
launch vehicle for ignition.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.667
How come you always
get to be Neil?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.458
- 'Huh, Chuck?'
- Cause I'm the commander.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.750
You can be Buzz Aldrin,
the mission specialist.

07:01.917 --> 07:06.458
Okay, she's set to fly, captain.

07:06.542 --> 07:09.750
Saved every cherry bomb
I could find from 4th of
July.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.750
Rocket's loaded and
ready for liftoff.

07:12.834 --> 07:16.250
Loaded and ready.
This baby's going to the moon.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.542
I hope you know it's
not going to work.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.417
Go play with your Bunsen
burner,
Poindexter. Busy here.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.333
Look, you can't just pack
it full of explosives.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.166
You have to cut the powder
with sulfur, otherwise--

07:25.250 --> 07:29.792
Kid, we need your help,
we'll ask for it. Got it?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.834
Alright, men.
Let's light this candle.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.625
Let me do it, Chuck.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.375
[sighs]
Here we go!

07:39.458 --> 07:40.875
(together)
Ten, nine

07:40.959 --> 07:43.041
eight, seven

07:43.125 --> 07:44.834
six, five

07:44.917 --> 07:46.083
four, three..

07:52.166 --> 07:53.875
(Danny)
'Told you so.'

08:00.917 --> 08:03.875
That stunt caused
a lot of trouble.

08:03.959 --> 08:07.125
Chuck's dad about
skinned him alive.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.792
Remember their names?

08:08.875 --> 08:12.041
Just Chuck Pierce,
the cute one.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.875
But those three, they were
always together, though.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.500
Ever see them with
your brother again?

08:15.583 --> 08:18.667
Chuck came by the next day.
Asked to see Danny.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.166
'I remember being disappointed.'

08:20.250 --> 08:22.250
I thought he
was there to see me.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.041
Civvie who took in the
rocket's a real paperweight.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.917
Oh, let me guess,
less than helpful.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.458
Like pulling teeth.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.583
I finally got him to remember
what time the guy brought it
in.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.208
I went back and dug through
the catch desk sign-in sheets.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.917
Came up with a name,
Mike Collins.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.625
Great, got to be what, 800 of
them in the Philly phone book?

08:38.709 --> 08:40.458
Yeah. Go, Irish.

08:40.542 --> 08:41.875
Your boyfriend
called again.

08:41.959 --> 08:44.625
Mack asked if we want
him in on interviews.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.750
Told him, thanks. We're good.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.041
You going to share your
desk with this guy, Lill?

08:49.125 --> 08:50.583
(Lilly)
'Aw, he was a good cop.'

08:50.667 --> 08:52.291
Tough to walk away when
you got business to settle.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.750
I'm still sweating cases
after I get my gold watch

08:54.834 --> 08:57.291
do me a favor,
put me out of my misery.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.750
Count on it.

08:58.834 --> 09:01.625
Crackpot Mack said Chuck Pierce
used to run with some boys

09:01.709 --> 09:04.083
Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.041
All three of them
interviewed in '69.

09:06.125 --> 09:07.792
Said they were watching
the moon landing together.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.417
Doesn't look like Chuck
let go of the rocket thing.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.792
Naval aviator, applied
for NASA in the '90s.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.375
Private air captain now.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.375
Lear jets of the
rich and famous.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.625
Poor man's Neil Armstrong,
this guy.

09:18.709 --> 09:19.709
Let's see what Neil Armstrong

09:19.792 --> 09:21.750
has to say about
the Rocket Boys.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.750
Yeah, it was a real shock
when Danny turned up dead.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.375
Block was never
the same again.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.041
Yeah, how so?

09:34.125 --> 09:35.625
Predator on the streets.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.333
Parents wouldn't let kids
play
outside after dark anymore.

09:38.417 --> 09:39.917
Only now, thinking Danny might

09:40.000 --> 09:41.291
have been with
friends
the night he died.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.959
You friends with
Danny
back then, Chuck?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.750
Friends?
Not really.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.417
No, Danny was kind of a..
Kind of an odd duck.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.959
On the night of the moon
landing did you see him around?

09:50.041 --> 09:52.208
No, I was at home
watching it on TV.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.959
- Pinnacle of human
achievement.
- You with anyone?

09:55.041 --> 09:59.583
Yeah, I was, I was with, uh,
Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.583
Haven't seen those guys in
years. They lived on my block.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.834
The Chestnut Hill
Rocket Boys,
right?

10:04.917 --> 10:07.375
Yeah, well,
rockets were a phase

10:07.458 --> 10:10.208
I mean probably because
of the moon landing and all.

10:10.291 --> 10:12.166
I think we were into
sharks the next week.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.250
Then, uh, why'd
you stop by Danny's

10:18.333 --> 10:21.834
the day after you and your
posse
blew the neighborhood to China

10:21.917 --> 10:23.291
trying to launch a rocket?

10:23.375 --> 10:25.917
Ah, well, we wanted
to see what he knew.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.208
I mean, a rocket
without a brain to guide it

10:28.291 --> 10:30.041
is pretty much
just a pipe bomb.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.875
- Hmm.
- He help you out?

10:31.959 --> 10:33.333
Oh, yeah, sure, he'd do anything

10:33.417 --> 10:35.166
anything to be our friend.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.750
We, we were just out to have
a good time but this kid..

10:37.834 --> 10:39.792
[chuckles]
This kid was obsessed.

10:40.917 --> 10:43.041
Once we're in,
we got to move fast.

10:43.125 --> 10:46.208
The foreman, Mr. Wallace,
hates kids.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.250
Heard he killed a
guy
on his site once.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.750
They say he buried
the body in the yard.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.375
Never found it.

10:52.458 --> 10:53.875
We have to make the
nozzle out of something

10:53.959 --> 10:55.417
that'll hold up to
the heat from takeoff

10:55.500 --> 10:57.125
launch the vehicle all
the way into the mesosphere.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.875
Geek, you don't shut it

10:58.959 --> 11:00.291
I'm gonna launch
you
in the mesosphere.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.041
We're supposed to be
sneaking in, nimrods.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.792
Wallace is going to
hear us a mile away.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.083
Shh.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.959
This is it.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.500
Up and over, men.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.458
Uh, guys?

11:16.667 --> 11:18.917
I'm really not so great
at climbing fences.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.417
Ah, gee, there's a surprise.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.792
There, we need that piece.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.500
The one that's shaped like a
cone right on top, it's
perfect.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.291
Hey, hey!

11:36.375 --> 11:37.959
Hey!

11:38.041 --> 11:39.750
'Come here!'

11:39.834 --> 11:41.917
- Hey, you little bastards!
- Come on. Go, go, go!

11:42.000 --> 11:44.125
Get the hell off
this property.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.250
You think you're
going to steal from me?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.291
Aw...bite it, dirtbag.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.333
You runt, show
your face in here again

11:52.417 --> 11:54.333
you'll see what happens, man.

11:54.417 --> 11:56.375
Come on! Come on!

11:57.709 --> 11:59.458
That guy was a damn menace.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.959
'Everybody knew it,
but like I said'

12:01.041 --> 12:02.959
that kid Danny,
he was obsessed.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.500
You saying he went back?

12:04.583 --> 12:07.458
He told us that everything
we
needed to launch a rocket

12:07.542 --> 12:09.667
was inside that fence.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.166
When was this?

12:11.250 --> 12:13.875
Oh, I don't know maybe
a week before the moon landing.

12:23.291 --> 12:26.792
(Neil Armstrong)
That's one small step for man

12:26.875 --> 12:29.375
one...giant leap for mankind.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.417
Night, Lill.

12:35.041 --> 12:38.000
You find anything on
the rest of Chuck's crew?

12:38.083 --> 12:40.500
Well, Seth Rundgren
has a colorful
history.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.000
A court-ordered
lockup
'86 to '90.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.125
Schizo-affective disorder.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.583
Bobby Kent's a floor manager

12:46.667 --> 12:49.000
at Zane's Sporting Goods
in Germantown.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.542
What about this
Wallace character?

12:50.625 --> 12:52.291
Picked up an
assault
and battery in '68

12:52.375 --> 12:53.583
for slapping around a junkie

12:53.667 --> 12:55.500
trying to steal
copper from his
site.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.000
Put the guy in
ICU
for three weeks.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.875
You get something
off that rocket, Nick?

12:58.959 --> 13:00.583
Rocket science, people.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.125
Well, the factory
that machine-tooled

13:02.208 --> 13:03.917
the metal cone
Danny used as a nozzle

13:04.000 --> 13:06.542
'was located
right here in Philly.'

13:08.250 --> 13:10.750
"DWC Custom Manufacturing."

13:10.834 --> 13:13.083
Place was knocked down, the
summer of '68 and guess who's

13:13.166 --> 13:17.083
on the books as site foreman
for the demolition company.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.834
Dick Wallace.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.917
Meaner than a junkyard dog.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.083
Best demo company
on the Eastern seaboard.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.500
Ain't a building they put up
I can't pull down on a dime.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.041
'69, though

13:41.125 --> 13:43.959
you were just starting
to make a name for
yourself.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.375
I paid my dues.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.792
Took any job
that'd have me.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.041
Demo, drywall,
construction.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.792
Site watchdog.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.417
Yeah, I was the ogre.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.542
Somebody had to be.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.000
Rob you blind, otherwise.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.375
Like that junkie you
busted open back in '68.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.875
Freak pulled
a knife on
me.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.792
What am I supposed
to do? Bleed on
him?

14:02.875 --> 14:04.250
Sure, I get it.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.625
Sometimes you got to crack
a few skulls, get things done.

14:07.709 --> 14:09.125
Yeah, you said it.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.625
What about Danny Finch?

14:11.709 --> 14:14.500
(Scotty)
'Kids tried to sneak on your
lot, you make a few threats.'

14:14.583 --> 14:18.208
Week later, this boy
turns up beaten to death.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.083
(Will)
'Danny thought he could
outsmart you, sneak back in.'

14:21.166 --> 14:22.917
It's not like
you didn't warn him.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.709
Yeah, I warned him
alright,
not that it did any
good.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.000
You got to be some
kind
of special nitwit,
right?

14:35.083 --> 14:38.875
It's almost $14.
It's all I got.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.875
W-we just need maybe 200
grams of potassium nitrate.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.333
Forget it.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.041
Seriously, kid, amscray.

14:47.125 --> 14:50.375
Look, I'm sorry we broke in

14:50.458 --> 14:53.583
but my friends,
they're counting on me.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.792
I'm like Wernher von Braun
to them.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.208
Wernher von Braun.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.792
The scientist who
created the space program.

15:00.875 --> 15:05.291
Without him...without me
that rocket will never fly.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.125
I've been up all night
working out the mix

15:09.208 --> 15:10.709
trying to get it right.

15:10.792 --> 15:13.041
If I do, maybe
they'll see that I'm..

15:15.208 --> 15:17.000
That you're what?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.542
Nothing.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.834
Probably hopeless anyway.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.500
The calculations
never come out right.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.083
It's going to explode
or fly off course.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.750
I'm gonna regret this.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.458
Should be about
the right mix.

15:37.542 --> 15:39.500
Need an emulsifier
to bind the powder.

15:39.583 --> 15:43.083
'The right nozzle, it should
burn clean instead of a..'

15:43.166 --> 15:45.625
...fast explosion,
know what I mean?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.583
Hey, kid.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.583
Calculations will only
get you so far in life,
right?

15:53.667 --> 15:57.250
At some point,
you got to get
outside

15:57.333 --> 15:59.458
you got to make it work.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.000
[whispering]
Wow.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.542
Wow, this is perfect.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.041
- Yeah, the scrap metal's--
- Yeah, I know.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.834
Saw the perfect part for the
nozzle when we were here
before.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.375
Well, take what
you
need, alright?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.583
Just don't be bringing
your little hood pals
back.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.166
Hey, kid.

16:17.250 --> 16:22.542
You blow yourself up, you
leave
my name the hell out of it.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.166
You dig?

16:26.458 --> 16:28.375
Alright, now beat it.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.583
You gave a 12-year-old
kid dynamite?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.542
It was a different time.

16:34.625 --> 16:38.375
No lawsuits, no
helmets,
no safety seats.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.458
We let kids be kids.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.583
So, Danny..

16:46.166 --> 16:48.542
...he managed to
launch that rocket, huh?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.417
Looks like it.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.667
[chuckles]
That's
good.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.583
Good for him.

17:03.166 --> 17:04.625
Seth Rundgren?

17:04.709 --> 17:06.875
(Lilly)
'Detectives Rush, Vera.'

17:06.959 --> 17:09.625
- Need a hand?
- No, thanks.

17:09.709 --> 17:12.250
Few questions
about Danny Finch.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.417
Danny Finch.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.875
Mind if we come inside,
talk about it?

17:23.291 --> 17:24.959
The last time I saw Danny

17:25.041 --> 17:27.792
'he wanted us to break
into a construction site.'

17:27.875 --> 17:29.458
(Lilly)
'We heard.'

17:31.250 --> 17:33.959
We climbed a fence
and-and a man came out

17:34.041 --> 17:36.208
with a baseball bat
and chased us away.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.000
Right. What about after that?
The day of the moon landing.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.667
You see Danny that day?

17:42.041 --> 17:43.750
Please don't touch that.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.083
Oops.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.333
'Seth.'

17:47.417 --> 17:49.750
The day of the moon landing.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.375
T-t-there was no moon landing.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.083
Come again?

17:54.166 --> 17:58.917
It's the pinnacle of human
achievement and it was a hoax.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.500
T-t-they shot the whole thing
on a, on a soundstage.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.625
Who's they?

18:03.709 --> 18:07.291
NASA, the CIA, LBJ.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.417
Lyndon Johnson
faked the moon landing?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.667
'I've talked to agents
who were there.'

18:11.750 --> 18:13.000
They tell me things

18:13.083 --> 18:16.834
t-t-the, t-the truth
about what happened that day.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.333
Danny think the same way?

18:18.417 --> 18:21.458
He said it was the scientists
who made it happen.

18:21.542 --> 18:24.417
Without them, the Eagle
never would have landed.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.917
Seth the broadcast about
the Eagle landing happened

18:28.000 --> 18:29.500
the day Danny died.

18:29.583 --> 18:32.083
If he said that, it means
you saw him that day.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.458
Three of you were with him
when he launched the rocket.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.542
The Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys.

18:38.834 --> 18:42.166
I know what
you're trying to do.

18:42.250 --> 18:46.667
Y-you're trying to get me
to say that I, I see Danny.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.750
'But he's gone.'

18:50.834 --> 18:52.375
I-I know that.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.333
But you still see him sometimes?

18:55.625 --> 18:57.500
They say it's the disease.

18:57.583 --> 19:02.208
It, it, it makes me believe
things that aren't true.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.583
Who's they?
Chuck and Bobby?

19:05.667 --> 19:08.500
Seth, you talk to them lately?

19:09.625 --> 19:13.208
Your friends
when you were 12.

19:14.959 --> 19:18.125
How many of them
do you still talk to?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.750
Guy gives new meaning to
the word certifiable.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.208
Keep pushing, we'll never get
a straight story out of him.

19:24.291 --> 19:25.750
Just lock up
under pressure.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.417
Stick a tail on him, see
what he does, where he
goes.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.917
Believe his rap about not
talking to Bobby and Chuck?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.625
Not for a second.

19:32.709 --> 19:35.417
I did steal his
phone
bill off his desk.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.750
Lot of calls
to one number.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.750
Bet it ain't the CIA.

19:45.542 --> 19:48.417
I got a few minutes before
I'm back on the floor.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.208
Say you're looking for some
contact info for Seth
Rundgren?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.083
Yeah, know any way we
can get a hold of him?

19:53.166 --> 19:54.417
I wish I could help, but..

19:54.500 --> 19:56.417
I haven't talked to
him in, gosh, ages.

19:57.709 --> 20:01.875
Go ahead. Pick it
up.
We'll wait.

20:01.959 --> 20:03.792
Hello.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.667
What up, liar?

20:06.834 --> 20:08.542
Got your number off
of Seth's phone
records.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.417
He's been calling you 20
times
a week for the past month.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
You sure you haven't
talked to him in
ages?

20:13.583 --> 20:15.583
You can hang
up now, Bobby.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.500
The three of you were
with
Danny the night he died.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.959
Seth already told us.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.542
Question is why is
he calling you so
much?

20:23.542 --> 20:25.542
And why are you
both lying about
it?

20:25.625 --> 20:29.041
Look, Seth has a
pretty weird imagination.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.959
That's one way of puttin' it.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.375
Something go down with Seth
and Danny that night?

20:33.458 --> 20:34.709
No.

20:34.792 --> 20:37.375
Oh, come on, Bobby.
Unstable guy..

20:37.458 --> 20:39.125
Maybe not even
his fault, right?

20:39.208 --> 20:42.375
Out in the woods,
a dare gone bad.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.583
Guess we got to take you
downtown, sort this all out.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.458
Okay, okay, alright.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.208
It isn't about Seth.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.834
Seth and Chuck
are lying to protect
me.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.583
This is outstanding.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.166
Nice job, Danny.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.667
Yeah.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.083
Nice job.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.291
Bobby, why do you say
everything Chuck says

21:03.375 --> 21:04.834
right after
he says it?

21:05.667 --> 21:07.166
I don't.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.875
Actually, you kind of do.

21:08.959 --> 21:10.500
Shut up, dork.
What do you know?

21:10.583 --> 21:12.041
Hey, ease off.

21:12.125 --> 21:15.000
He's the reason
we're out here.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.000
Ought to be at home
watching this on TV.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.667
You kidding?
This is way better.

21:19.750 --> 21:20.959
We're living it, man.

21:21.041 --> 21:22.667
Right, Danny?

21:22.750 --> 21:24.834
Yeah, this is the best.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.583
Never really been
in the woods before.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.333
We're explorers.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.792
Conquerors.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.208
I'm Neil Armstrong,
commander of the--

21:35.291 --> 21:36.709
Ow!

21:36.792 --> 21:38.542
What was that?

21:38.625 --> 21:40.166
There's something
in the woods.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.709
Die, wusses!

21:52.792 --> 21:53.750
Chuck!

21:56.625 --> 22:00.000
My half-brother, Malcolm,
and his dirtbag buddy,
Griff

22:00.083 --> 22:01.792
they used to beat our
ass every chance they
got.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.375
You left Danny
behind with them?

22:03.458 --> 22:04.667
Nothing we could have done--

22:04.750 --> 22:06.083
And when Danny
turns up dead?

22:06.166 --> 22:07.208
They killed Danny,
what do you think

22:07.291 --> 22:08.291
they would have done to me?

22:08.375 --> 22:10.125
Where are your
parents in all this?

22:10.208 --> 22:13.500
Dad split, and mom
was working all the
time.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.917
She left Malcolm
in charge of me.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.625
Best thing that ever
happened was the two of them

22:17.709 --> 22:20.458
shipping off to Vietnam,
the second they turned
18.

22:20.542 --> 22:22.166
Griff died over there.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.000
Malcolm came back even worse.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.583
And where is he now?

22:25.667 --> 22:29.083
Up at Graterford, doing ten
to twenty for armed robbery.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.667
So, now Brother Bobby's
trying to pin a murder on me

22:46.750 --> 22:47.792
that's swell.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.750
It sounds like
you got it
comin'.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.208
Made his life hell.

22:51.291 --> 22:52.917
Life is hell.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.417
Better he
learned
that early on.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.750
Nice record
you got, Malcolm

22:55.834 --> 22:58.542
armed robbery, assault

22:58.625 --> 22:59.917
killing animals.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.458
Not a big leap
to doing in a kid.

23:01.542 --> 23:03.792
You made your minds up.
Pull the trigger
already.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.291
Says here you got a shot
at parole in seven
months.

23:06.375 --> 23:08.458
Number might come
down or go up

23:08.542 --> 23:10.583
depending how
interesting
you make our time here.

23:10.667 --> 23:14.208
This is a simple question.
See Danny that day or not?

23:16.583 --> 23:18.959
Yeah, we saw him.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.709
Kid was about
to wet his
shorts.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.750
- You like that sound, maggot?
- Let me go.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.792
Should have learned
to run faster, professor.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.375
Might have lived
a little longer.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.625
Hey, what have
we got here?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.542
Man, that is
one big-ass firecracker.

23:34.625 --> 23:37.875
Fuse and everything. What are
you gonna do with this, dork?

23:37.959 --> 23:39.667
Let's light it
under his twerp ass

23:39.750 --> 23:41.500
see how many pieces
it makes of him.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.000
Leave it alone. It's ours!

23:43.083 --> 23:46.166
Leave it alone!
Or what, wuss?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.667
Light it up, Griff.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.542
Oh!

23:54.583 --> 23:55.583
Broke my nose!

23:55.667 --> 23:57.542
Kill him!

24:02.166 --> 24:03.208
Ah!

24:05.417 --> 24:08.417
What? The rocket's
mine, numb-nuts.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.750
Wait up.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.125
Deviated my septum,
little bastard.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.542
[whistling]
You hear that?

24:15.625 --> 24:17.166
Still whistles when I breathe.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.291
Got your asses kicked
by a couple 12-year-olds?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.083
Seth wanted that
rocket real bad.

24:21.166 --> 24:24.000
He was crazy enough
to take us on for
it.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.458
Hey, I was honest with you.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.166
That's got to be
worth something,
right?

24:29.250 --> 24:31.500
Right. We'll get
back to you, Malcolm.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.041
No, you won't.

24:33.125 --> 24:37.291
'I been in here long enough.
I ain't stupid, but hey..'

24:37.375 --> 24:41.834
Tell Bobby his big brother
says hello, would you?

24:51.291 --> 24:53.375
(Mack)
Uh, took you long enough.

24:55.458 --> 24:56.667
Thank you.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.750
Never much into housekeeping.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.291
[chuckles]
Nice.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.834
Those
interviews
that you took

25:07.917 --> 25:10.166
from the boys
in the neighborhood..

25:11.041 --> 25:12.583
...still got them?

25:13.375 --> 25:15.083
I got everything.

25:17.959 --> 25:19.166
So, where do you want to start?

25:19.250 --> 25:22.917
Seth Rundgren, Bobby Kent
and Chuck Pierce.

25:24.041 --> 25:25.417
Here you go.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.792
You ever have a case like this?

25:29.875 --> 25:33.125
You know, one
that sticks with you

25:33.208 --> 25:35.500
doesn't let you rest?

25:35.583 --> 25:37.417
Yeah, I, I do.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.583
Name's Cooper.

25:40.667 --> 25:43.417
And the kicker is
he's still out there.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.875
Unsolicited advice?

25:49.375 --> 25:51.417
Don't let it sit for 30 years.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.834
Starts eating away at you.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.500
Trust me on that.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.875
Their stories are exactly
the same across the board

26:00.959 --> 26:02.834
pinnacle of human achievement.

26:02.917 --> 26:04.959
Still doing it today.
Chuck says it.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.917
Seth's got the same
lines, word for word.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.375
Like "The Manchurian Candidate."

26:09.458 --> 26:11.750
Danny gets killed
here in the park

26:11.834 --> 26:13.125
'and dumped in the Wissahickon.'

26:13.208 --> 26:15.417
Then floats all the way
down to the river.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.041
Some of the injuries could
have
come from the beating he took

26:18.125 --> 26:20.583
but the marks
on his legs and arms..

26:20.667 --> 26:23.375
maybe postmortem, bumping off
the rocks as he drifted?

26:23.458 --> 26:25.000
Well, it was a rainy summer.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.333
Creek was swollen.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.625
Would have only
taken a few hours.

26:28.709 --> 26:30.083
Now, that spot
could be right where

26:30.166 --> 26:31.875
our Michael Collins
found the rocket.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.125
Michael Collins?

26:33.208 --> 26:34.542
'The guy who brought
in the rocket.'

26:34.625 --> 26:36.417
Probably a fake name.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.834
Michael Collins
was the third astronaut

26:38.917 --> 26:40.333
on the Apollo 11 mission.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.792
Third astronaut?

26:41.875 --> 26:43.500
Armstrong and Aldrin
landed on the moon

26:43.583 --> 26:45.834
put their footsteps
down, became heroes

26:45.917 --> 26:48.208
and Michael Collins..

26:48.291 --> 26:50.166
He stayed in orbit around
the moon and never landed.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.625
The boys were
playing astronauts.

26:51.709 --> 26:54.500
If Chuck was Armstrong,
and Bobby was Aldrin--

26:54.583 --> 26:57.083
Seth was Michael Collins.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.500
Michael Collins.

27:04.417 --> 27:07.375
Y-you-you followed me.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.917
You found the rocket here?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.083
No, not, not, not here.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.375
Up the path by the ravine.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.750
You brought it in
'cause you wanted
us

27:15.834 --> 27:17.792
to reopen Danny's case. Why?

27:17.875 --> 27:21.291
I don't want to-to
see it anymore.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.542
I-I want it to stop.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.208
What do you want
to stop, Seth?

27:25.291 --> 27:26.750
What I remember.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.166
It can't be real.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.375
What wasn't real?

27:29.458 --> 27:31.166
The moon landing, the launch?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.458
No, our..

27:33.542 --> 27:36.000
...our launch was-was real.

27:38.458 --> 27:39.959
You chickens
through running away?

27:40.041 --> 27:41.458
Oh, you made it back.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.083
You got away.

27:43.166 --> 27:45.041
- Holy crap.
- How did you do it?

27:45.125 --> 27:47.667
Danny punched Malcolm
right in the honker. Paw!

27:47.750 --> 27:49.250
Nah, it was all Seth.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.542
I'd be dead if he
didn't come back.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.000
(Bobby)
'We're all dead anyways.'

27:52.083 --> 27:55.208
Malcolm will never let this go.

27:55.291 --> 27:58.458
Forget it.
He can kill us tomorrow.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.917
Right now...we got
a rocket to launch.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.959
(in unison)
Yeah.

28:05.041 --> 28:06.333
Let's do it.

28:12.166 --> 28:14.000
- This is right here.
- Yeah.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.583
- Great.
- This is it.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.083
Engraved it

28:19.166 --> 28:21.709
so whoever finds it
knows who we are.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.959
The Rocket Boys.

28:26.125 --> 28:28.291
- It's great.
- Hey, guys, listen.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.625
(Neil Armstrong on radio)
'One small step..'

28:29.709 --> 28:31.625
They're walking
on the moon.

28:31.709 --> 28:35.333
(Neil Armstrong on radio)
'...one giant leap for
mankind.'

28:39.917 --> 28:41.250
Wow.

28:41.333 --> 28:42.709
They did it.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.458
You light it, Seth.

28:57.542 --> 28:58.959
Whoa!

28:59.041 --> 29:00.875
(in unison)
Ten, nine

29:00.959 --> 29:02.875
eight, seven

29:02.959 --> 29:04.625
six, five

29:04.709 --> 29:07.041
four, three, two

29:07.125 --> 29:08.375
one!

29:18.583 --> 29:20.875
What happened then,
after the launch?

29:20.959 --> 29:22.542
What happened out here?

29:22.625 --> 29:24.875
We had to jump.

29:24.959 --> 29:27.250
It was only way
to get home

29:27.333 --> 29:29.625
before our parents caught us.

29:29.709 --> 29:32.333
Chuck and Bobby told me
he-he didn't make it

29:32.417 --> 29:35.375
but I-I know
that's not true.

29:35.458 --> 29:37.166
Because I saw him.

29:39.750 --> 29:43.208
I think you're gonna
have to come with me.

29:47.583 --> 29:48.834
How long you been at him?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.959
Hour or so.
Guy's
all over the
place.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.417
Still think he
knows who did it?

29:52.500 --> 29:53.583
I don't know.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.709
A whole lot
more than
just

29:54.792 --> 29:56.291
phone calls
between these
three.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.333
Chuck and Bobby have been
paying
Seth's way the last 20 years.

29:58.417 --> 29:59.834
A lot of money.

29:59.917 --> 30:02.375
Got Chuck's name on receipts
for clozapine, loxitane.

30:02.458 --> 30:04.041
Heavy meds.

30:04.125 --> 30:07.041
They're doing everything
they can to keep him
quiet.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.291
Boss!

30:17.709 --> 30:19.083
Get the medics!

30:21.291 --> 30:23.041
This is Rush in Homicide.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.792
Get a medic unit
in here now.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.250
Pronounced him at
the ER at Roxborough.

30:38.250 --> 30:41.000
Guy was a mess. I
shouldn't
have left him alone.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.792
(John)
'Yeah, well, nothing
you could have done, Nick.'

30:43.875 --> 30:45.750
Something happened
at that creek.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.291
And Seth would rather die
than tell us what it is.

30:50.709 --> 30:53.041
Your friend's
on the slab, Bobby.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.375
Seth?

30:54.458 --> 30:57.750
Killed himself right over
the table you're leaning
on.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.709
Died keeping your secret.

31:01.792 --> 31:04.667
Almost like you
killed him yourself.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.750
Poor guy.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.291
Never really had a chance.

31:10.375 --> 31:13.250
Friends like you...I guess not.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.583
Don't seem very
surprised, Chuck.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.458
We did everything
we could to help him.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.083
Why is that?
Goodness of your heart?

31:20.166 --> 31:23.500
We were practically brothers,
the three of us.

31:24.625 --> 31:25.959
We couldn't let him down.

31:26.041 --> 31:27.875
That's what
everybody
did his whole life.

31:27.959 --> 31:30.208
- You tried to help him.
- That's right.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.834
Just little things.

31:31.917 --> 31:33.792
- Making sure he was okay.
- 'Little things?'

31:33.875 --> 31:36.834
Like the 14,000 bucks
for his mental hospital?

31:36.917 --> 31:38.959
Ten years' worth
of antipsychotic meds?

31:39.041 --> 31:40.125
That wasn't me.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.291
What happened
at the creek,
Bobby?

31:42.375 --> 31:45.000
Seth said Danny made the
jump,
Chuck said he didn't.

31:45.083 --> 31:47.250
What's Chuck paying
all that money to hide?

31:50.458 --> 31:53.250
Alright, so I...I paid
a few of Seth's bills.

31:53.333 --> 31:55.000
It's only because he
couldn't afford to do it.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.041
- Bobby, either.
- You were keeping him quiet.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.750
- No, I was helping him cope.
- 'With your secret.'

31:59.834 --> 32:03.417
Tearing him up inside
for the past 39 years.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.667
(Scotty)
'The jump, Chuck.'

32:04.750 --> 32:07.333
Tell us what
happened at the
jump.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.166
Chuck bent over
backwards to help
Seth.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.083
That's the kind of guy he is.

32:13.166 --> 32:15.333
End of story.

32:15.417 --> 32:18.000
I got nothing else to say.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.667
Little memento for you.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.000
Sit here with
your dead friends

32:30.083 --> 32:32.083
and think about
how they got that way.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.917
(Scotty)
'Now, Chuck's not gonna break
unless we got him cold.'

32:39.000 --> 32:40.583
Bobby's so deep
in his thrall

32:40.667 --> 32:42.917
it's like getting him
to rat out Jesus.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.417
Hero worship.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.250
(John)
'Chuck's throwing
money at the problem'

32:46.333 --> 32:47.875
but Bobby's doing all the work.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.750
'Cause Bobby
actually
cares.

32:51.542 --> 32:53.166
I got this.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.083
Get up.

32:58.166 --> 33:00.333
I gotta cuff you before
I take you to your cell.

33:00.417 --> 33:02.583
Wait...what?

33:02.667 --> 33:04.750
(Nick)
'Chuck tossed you
under the bus.'

33:04.834 --> 33:06.959
You're locked up for murder.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.208
Chuck wouldn't..

33:08.291 --> 33:10.208
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, he did.

33:10.291 --> 33:12.000
And he's gonna get away with
it
because you're too spineless

33:12.083 --> 33:13.709
to do the right thing.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.917
Get up!

33:15.000 --> 33:16.917
(Bobby)
'I didn't do anything.'

33:17.000 --> 33:18.083
I didn't do anything!

33:18.166 --> 33:20.375
Save it! Bedtime story
for your cellmate.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.542
Wait, Chuck said
I did something?

33:22.625 --> 33:24.583
- Why would he do that?
- I don't get it.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.291
You follow the guy
around like a sheep.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.417
- I'm not a sheep.
- Ba, ba, ba.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.041
That's all I hear when
you open your mouth.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.250
Guy thinks he's the king
of the world, jetting around

33:32.333 --> 33:33.917
and you're stuck here
cleaning up the mess.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.500
With Seth? I
was
glad to do it.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.125
Chuck said we were a team.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.083
He's my best friend.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.333
Sit down.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.041
Last chance.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.458
Or you're gonna spend
the rest of your life

33:48.542 --> 33:50.667
in a cell half the
size of this room.

33:53.959 --> 33:57.500
We tried to get back home
after we launched the
rocket.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.667
Chuck said he knew
the way, but he was
wrong.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.125
Not this place again.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.458
We've been out
here all night.

34:07.542 --> 34:08.959
We gotta get home.

34:09.041 --> 34:10.583
Too far to jump.

34:11.709 --> 34:12.959
We gotta go around.

34:13.041 --> 34:14.250
That's what you said last time.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.291
How we got lost
in the first place?

34:17.375 --> 34:19.750
We're never gonna make it back
before our parents wake up.

34:19.834 --> 34:23.083
- What about your dad?
- I said it's too far.

34:23.166 --> 34:26.458
Standing around talking about
it is just gonna take longer.

34:29.542 --> 34:31.917
We can do it. You?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.291
Not a chance.
Forget it.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.458
We can do anything.
We're the Rocket Boys.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.917
Will you shut up
about that? It's
stupid.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.542
It's not stupid.
It's the best thing ever.

34:41.625 --> 34:44.542
You don't get it. I'm not
even supposed to be out
here.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.125
My dad finds
out,
I'm dead, okay?

34:50.375 --> 34:52.208
We go around.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.291
What's this?
Let's go.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.291
I'm with Danny.

35:05.375 --> 35:07.834
[chuckles]
You'll never make it, Seth.

35:07.917 --> 35:10.500
Yeah? Watch me.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.500
[laughing]
He's right.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.792
See you at home, suckers.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.875
[chuckles]
Almost didn't
make
it over, fat-ass.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.208
Lay an egg, psycho.

35:37.291 --> 35:39.500
I cleared it by a mile.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.834
Yeah.

35:55.834 --> 35:57.667
Race you to the bend.

35:58.750 --> 36:02.041
I never saw a kid
so proud of
himself.

36:02.125 --> 36:05.709
Chuck said he was too
weak,
he didn't make it.

36:05.792 --> 36:06.959
But he did.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.166
So how'd he end
up in the water?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.542
I don't know.
We ran ahead.

36:10.625 --> 36:13.083
Look, Chuck was the leader.

36:13.166 --> 36:16.125
If he said it,
it had to be
true.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.959
After a while, I
started
believing it myself.

36:22.166 --> 36:24.208
But Seth never did.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.208
It just chewed him
up on the inside.

36:30.417 --> 36:32.333
I've been checking
into your family, Chuck.

36:32.417 --> 36:35.750
Who knew the Pierces were
such an American dynasty?

36:35.834 --> 36:38.417
Yeah, dad's a war hero.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.417
Built a textile
company from scratch

36:41.500 --> 36:43.000
turned it into an empire.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.208
You got a point?

36:44.291 --> 36:47.583
It's hard to live
up to. Only son.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.458
A lot of pressure on a kid.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.959
I thrived on it.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.500
- Some people do.
- Right.

36:53.583 --> 36:56.709
Right, 'cause you were
following in his footsteps.

36:56.792 --> 37:00.041
And 12-years-old or not,
you were a leader.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.500
That's why, when Danny
fell in the crick

37:02.583 --> 37:04.291
you tried to save him.

37:07.375 --> 37:10.500
Kid was so out of shape..

37:10.583 --> 37:12.959
...he couldn't hold
himself above the
water.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.917
He must've panicked.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.250
That's what happens,
situations like that.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.083
[whispers
]
Yeah.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.750
Maybe he was gonna
pull me down with
him.

37:24.834 --> 37:27.583
I...I had to save myself.

37:27.667 --> 37:29.834
I..

37:29.917 --> 37:33.667
I mean...so help me, God.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.166
I let him drown.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.166
Then covered it up.

37:39.250 --> 37:42.458
Papa Pierce found out,
worse than being
punished

37:42.542 --> 37:45.375
he'd have been
disappointed in you.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.625
It was an accident.

37:48.709 --> 37:52.750
And I spent the rest of my
life
trying to make up for it.

38:02.834 --> 38:06.333
You know, there's just
this one little detail

38:06.417 --> 38:08.041
that doesn't fit.

38:09.917 --> 38:12.542
Danny didn't drown, Chuck.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.709
There's no
water
in his lungs.

38:16.792 --> 38:19.375
- That's got to be a mistake.
- 'No mistake.'

38:19.458 --> 38:21.917
Someone cracked him in
the skull with a blunt object.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.834
(Scotty)
Whack.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.875
(Lilly)
'We didn't just check
into your family, Chuck.'

38:25.959 --> 38:27.542
We checked into you.

38:27.625 --> 38:28.959
(Scotty)
'Being an astronaut,
now that would've gotten'

38:29.041 --> 38:30.333
your old man off
your back for once.

38:30.417 --> 38:33.709
No, but NASA rejected you.
Three times.

38:33.792 --> 38:37.583
It's a good thing he's not
around anymore to see you.

38:38.959 --> 38:41.417
Bus driver in the sky
for rich people.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.875
Now Danny, he was
a real leader.

38:43.959 --> 38:45.208
Danny was weak.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.250
He was no leader.

38:46.333 --> 38:47.458
Buddies thought he was.

38:47.542 --> 38:48.667
Launched the rocket,
made the leap.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.250
Danny said jump and they jumped.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.834
But you...you were scared.

38:51.917 --> 38:53.458
And Papa Pierce finds
out about that

38:53.542 --> 38:54.709
might as well not
go home at all.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.250
You go to hell,
alright.
I was no coward.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.834
And Danny's death
was no accident.

38:58.917 --> 38:59.959
You know what, I want a,
I want a lawyer.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.250
You're dying to shut us up.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.625
Can see it on your face.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.583
Know what we did to piss you
off, what did Danny do?

39:04.667 --> 39:06.166
Danny shouldn't
even
have been there.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.625
Danny was no Rocket Boy.

39:07.709 --> 39:09.834
Maybe not at the
beginning,
but he made the jump.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.792
'He made it across.'

39:13.375 --> 39:16.542
He wasn't the
hero.
I was.

39:22.834 --> 39:24.875
It's okay,
Chuck.
You can do it.

39:24.959 --> 39:26.417
You're Neil Armstrong, remember?

39:26.500 --> 39:27.583
Just shut up!

39:27.667 --> 39:29.375
I'm not scared, alright!

39:29.458 --> 39:33.208
Then jump. Come on.
It's no big deal.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.208
Help me!

39:47.291 --> 39:48.875
Chuck!

39:50.834 --> 39:53.333
Chuck!

39:55.875 --> 39:59.250
Chuck, Chuck, I lost my glasses!

40:00.500 --> 40:02.083
I can't see!
Chuck!

40:03.417 --> 40:04.834
Help me!

40:05.709 --> 40:07.667
Chuck! Chuck, help!

40:18.583 --> 40:19.750
Chuck!

40:21.917 --> 40:24.458
Chuck, help me!
Chuck!

40:24.542 --> 40:25.959
(Bobby)
'Hey, what's going on?'

40:26.041 --> 40:27.500
I won't tell them
you were scared,
Chuck.

40:27.583 --> 40:28.834
(Seth)
'Hey, where are you, guys?'

40:28.917 --> 40:30.625
You think I was scared?

40:31.834 --> 40:33.208
(Seth)
'What's going on?'
