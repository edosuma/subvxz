WEBVTT

00:15.848 --> 00:17.150
Shun: Someone
got out of this cell.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.619
We can't know that
for certain.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.555
You said it yourself.
Ten passengers, nine bodies.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.656
We need to find them.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.759
Wait.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.128
Wait! ( exhales )

00:31.163 --> 00:33.666
We should
head back first.
Tell the others.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.934
We don't have time.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.236
If someone's out here
and they're infected
with this thing,

00:37.269 --> 00:39.004
they're a danger to everyone.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.074
How are we supposed
to find them?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.575
We don't know
our way around.

00:58.557 --> 01:01.261
This is stuff from Cell 50.
They left a trail.

01:07.666 --> 01:08.835
Lana: I can't see anymore.

01:12.638 --> 01:14.607
Lana, there.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.114
( water splashing )

01:33.693 --> 01:34.561
( loud bang )

01:35.895 --> 01:38.098
( Lana panting )

01:38.597 --> 01:40.433
Shun, look.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.236
They went up.

01:49.075 --> 01:50.777
We have to search
every level.

02:05.691 --> 02:06.793
automated voice:<i> Ring 4.</i>

02:11.531 --> 02:12.565
( Lana gasps )

02:12.598 --> 02:13.466
Lana: Here.

02:15.501 --> 02:17.270
Shun: Lana.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.172
This is the level
we woke up on.

02:22.274 --> 02:24.277
So they were near us,

02:25.978 --> 02:27.413
and we didn't even know?

02:31.050 --> 02:32.385
Shun: Maybe we did.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.422
They could look
like any one of us.

02:38.223 --> 02:39.826
You were
outside the cell.

02:42.895 --> 02:45.331
We were both outside.

02:46.999 --> 02:50.436
-I was looking for help.
-Convenient.

02:54.139 --> 02:57.443
-Get that gun
out of my face.
-No.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.917
I am not a liar.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.119
Then prove it.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.354
I woke up in
the same place as you.

03:08.387 --> 03:09.789
How am I supposed to know that?

03:12.224 --> 03:14.560
We're all strangers here.

03:14.593 --> 03:17.230
How are any one of us supposed
to prove that we're not
infected?

03:20.366 --> 03:21.567
Rey.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.303
She knows who came
out of that cell.

03:24.337 --> 03:28.308
If the person who escaped
really is among us,
she can identify them.

03:31.977 --> 03:32.845
She'll know.

03:35.214 --> 03:38.418
If you're right,
that puts her in
a lot of danger.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.497
Is she gonna make it?

03:52.998 --> 03:54.334
I don't know.

03:55.534 --> 03:58.004
Come on, Rey.
We need you.

04:20.893 --> 04:21.928
Papa.

04:24.463 --> 04:25.497
( both speaking in French )

04:25.530 --> 04:26.766
-Papa!
-( both chuckling )

04:40.479 --> 04:41.881
( jazz music playing )

04:46.152 --> 04:47.654
( clicks )

07:07.926 --> 07:08.894
( intercom beeps )

07:08.928 --> 07:10.930
Young: ( over intercom )
<i> Good morning, crew.</i>

07:11.931 --> 07:13.132
<i> It's 8:00 a.m. UTC,</i>

07:13.166 --> 07:16.635
<i> and today's wake-up call is
Beethoven's 7th.</i>

07:16.668 --> 07:17.669
( classical music playing )

07:17.702 --> 07:19.806
<i>Now, get your asses out of bed.</i>

07:43.329 --> 07:44.597
Jennifer: I can't help it.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.332
I think it every morning.
It's been...

07:46.365 --> 07:47.933
What are you talking about?

07:47.966 --> 07:50.403
There's a storm on its surface
that could fit three Earths
inside,

07:50.436 --> 07:52.071
and you wanna compare it
to a marble?

07:52.104 --> 07:53.673
I said "big-ass marble."

07:54.440 --> 07:55.641
See?

07:56.475 --> 07:58.010
Big-ass marble.

07:59.811 --> 08:00.813
( sighs )

08:02.247 --> 08:03.983
Find me after
cell checks, yeah?

08:16.362 --> 08:17.663
Fly, my pretty.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.135
( device beeping )

08:36.048 --> 08:37.516
( alarm blaring )

08:37.549 --> 08:39.185
automated voice:<i> Alert.
Passenger Code Blue.</i>

08:39.218 --> 08:40.520
( swearing in French )

08:42.488 --> 08:45.124
-( pod rattling )
-( alarm continues )

08:45.157 --> 08:46.859
I have a Code Blue on Cell 19.

08:46.892 --> 08:49.361
Passenger seems to be suffering
minor muscle spasms.

08:49.395 --> 08:52.030
Male crew:
<i> There's a doctor on Ring 4.
We'll send him across.</i>

08:52.064 --> 08:52.932
Thank you.

08:58.103 --> 08:59.305
Officer Rey.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.907
I'm Dr. Taylor.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.610
-What happened?
-I don't know.
He just started twitching.

09:04.643 --> 09:05.878
( Taylor grunts )

09:07.212 --> 09:08.981
( rattles )

09:09.014 --> 09:11.150
There's too much oxygen
in his bloodstream.

09:11.983 --> 09:14.220
-Too much?
-It's called "hyperoxia."

09:14.253 --> 09:17.557
If there's an excess for too
long, it can become poisonous.

09:18.957 --> 09:20.293
( moaning )

09:23.061 --> 09:25.598
Taylor: It's all right.
It's all right.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.099
You're okay.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.635
It's okay.

09:30.435 --> 09:31.737
You're all right.

09:33.439 --> 09:37.576
Okay, he's stable, but it'd
be worth checking on him
every few hours.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.011
At least for the next
couple of days.

09:39.044 --> 09:42.181
Every few hours?
Even through the night?

09:42.214 --> 09:43.215
( exhales )

09:43.248 --> 09:45.384
-Why, is that a problem?
-No.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.253
I just thought that
if a passenger needed
that level of care,

09:48.287 --> 09:50.422
it'd be your responsibility.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.924
You're the Rep
for this cell.

09:51.957 --> 09:54.559
I'd have thought
you want to stay close
to a sick passenger.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.028
Is it too big an ask?
( chuckles )

10:03.736 --> 10:04.836
Sanchez: Young?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.973
Young: Solar winds
are almost at zero.

10:07.006 --> 10:10.175
Captain, we're reaching
the edge of the heliosphere.

10:10.208 --> 10:15.247
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've made it to the edge
of interstellar space.

10:15.280 --> 10:19.384
We move into activation soon.
Now remember, people.

10:19.417 --> 10:23.088
The human body is not designed
to travel faster than light.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.590
This ship is.

10:24.623 --> 10:25.925
Follow the rules.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.729
Cell Reps, please,
prepare your passengers now,

10:30.363 --> 10:31.797
then yourself.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.800
( indistinct chattering )

10:48.280 --> 10:49.415
( beeps )

10:57.456 --> 10:58.658
( beeps )

11:07.532 --> 11:08.867
( hisses )

11:08.900 --> 11:11.137
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.075
( latch clicks )

11:18.077 --> 11:20.079
( beeping )

11:30.489 --> 11:33.893
automated voice:
<i> The Fu Drive will be
activated shortly.</i>

11:34.393 --> 11:36.061
( exhales )

11:36.094 --> 11:39.031
automated voice:<i> All of us
at SIREN wish you a safe
journey into light speed.</i>

11:39.565 --> 11:41.801
( powering up )

11:50.208 --> 11:52.244
( alarm blaring )

11:57.249 --> 11:58.984
( pod rattling )

11:59.017 --> 11:59.952
Help me!

12:04.990 --> 12:05.858
<i> Help me!</i>

12:07.492 --> 12:09.228
Help!

12:12.464 --> 12:13.432
-( gasps )
-( glass breaks )

12:13.465 --> 12:15.835
-( gasping )
-( rattling )

12:17.736 --> 12:19.905
( screaming )

12:25.411 --> 12:27.513
( laughter echoing )

13:04.316 --> 13:05.351
Hello?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.475
Anyone here?

13:34.413 --> 13:35.815
Hello?

13:51.964 --> 13:53.565
( indistinct whispering )

13:53.599 --> 13:54.834
( gasps )

14:31.703 --> 14:32.804
( growls )

14:32.838 --> 14:33.906
( gasps )

14:34.339 --> 14:35.474
( screams )

14:37.743 --> 14:40.111
( door opening )

14:40.145 --> 14:42.013
-Taylor: Hey.
-Huh? ( mumbles )

14:42.046 --> 14:43.315
Taylor: Hey, calm down.

14:43.348 --> 14:44.850
-It's okay.
-What's going on?

14:44.883 --> 14:48.186
( stammers ) Why can't I
open my eyes?

14:48.219 --> 14:52.024
When you hit your head,
you dented the seal
around your pod.

14:52.057 --> 14:56.395
The crack was minuscule,
but I'm afraid your eyes
were exposed for a few seconds.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.563
What does that mean?

14:59.064 --> 15:02.234
FTL travel is still
in its infancy.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.271
We don't fully understand
how it impacts the body.

15:06.638 --> 15:08.040
Am I blind?

15:10.308 --> 15:12.010
I treated you
as quickly as I could.

15:12.043 --> 15:14.079
Am I fucking blind?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.148
I don't know.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.586
-Your eyes need time
to heal. And then...
-And then?

15:21.853 --> 15:23.289
Then we'll find out.

15:26.691 --> 15:27.693
( sobs )

15:35.233 --> 15:38.237
Lana: ( on radio )
<i> Hello. Can anyone hear me?</i>

15:41.006 --> 15:43.141
Lana. Henri.

15:43.175 --> 15:46.578
Henri, you have to make sure
no one finds out about Rey.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.180
<i> We think
she might be in danger.
We're on our way.</i>

15:49.214 --> 15:51.816
Just keep her secret, okay?

15:51.850 --> 15:53.419
It might be a little
late for that.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.127
Thought we'd be good citizens.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.829
Ah-ah-ah.
What do you say?

16:04.863 --> 16:06.432
Give me the water,
fuckface.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.400
Here.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.737
I already drank some.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.173
Drink some more.

16:18.343 --> 16:19.578
Did you find any of the crew?

16:21.146 --> 16:24.583
Sure did.
Some engineer
in Cell 50

16:25.417 --> 16:27.086
turned up with
a hole in her gut.

16:29.354 --> 16:30.422
Lee: What?

16:30.455 --> 16:31.957
Where is she?

16:31.990 --> 16:33.958
In the medical center.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.561
They're trying
to save her life.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.069
Taylor: Okay. And big step.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.373
Rey: Okay, where are we?

16:48.340 --> 16:51.376
Taylor: Cell 19.
Your old haunt.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.178
Can't we go to the canteen
or something?

16:53.212 --> 16:56.081
I'm breaking the rules
by taking you out at all.

16:57.949 --> 16:59.118
Okay.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.653
First pod.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.056
Five points
if you can remember
who's inside.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.026
Rey: A woman, Asian?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.862
Taylor: That's the one.
Five points to you.

17:10.895 --> 17:12.897
So, did you
give her a name?

17:12.931 --> 17:14.466
( speaking in French )

17:14.500 --> 17:15.733
( stammering )

17:15.767 --> 17:17.902
I named all my passengers.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.572
I see them every day.
I want to feel like
I know them a little.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.175
It's amazing, really.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.180
Everyone in here willing
to leave everything behind
and start a new life.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.117
And how about this guy? Pod 6.

17:33.084 --> 17:34.753
Pod 6...

17:36.988 --> 17:39.391
-Brown hair?
-That's the one.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.995
I reckon he's
runaway royalty.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.531
Bottomless pockets,
but an empty heart.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.401
And pod number 7.

17:49.434 --> 17:53.004
Hmm. Caucasian guy.
He looks like a drug dealer.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.573
( Taylor chuckles )

17:56.241 --> 17:58.811
Taylor: I reckon
he looks spiritual.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.513
-Priest.
-Gay priest.

18:01.546 --> 18:04.349
Ravaged by doubt and guilt
about his own sexuality.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.151
Fled the church in search
of a new beginning.

18:06.184 --> 18:09.587
Yeah, but little did
poor Donald know that Thea
was full of comely men.

18:09.621 --> 18:10.922
( laughs )

18:10.956 --> 18:12.558
She can laugh. ( laughs )

18:14.993 --> 18:16.594
Uh...

18:16.628 --> 18:17.563
Look, um...

18:18.863 --> 18:21.666
I'm sorry I came down
so hard on you
when we first met.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.603
It's okay. You weren't
completely off target.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.805
My dad, he's, uh...

18:29.941 --> 18:30.876
He's sick.

18:32.811 --> 18:36.582
Or he was when I left.
I mean, now, I don't even
know if he's still alive.

18:37.682 --> 18:38.650
I'm sorry.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.620
I knew when I...

18:41.653 --> 18:46.158
When I said goodbye
to him, that he was
gonna suffer, but...

18:49.026 --> 18:50.596
( sighs )

18:51.029 --> 18:52.397
But I went.

18:53.598 --> 18:57.402
When I saw the passenger
in the pod failing, I...

18:57.435 --> 18:59.705
I don't know, it just reminded
me where I should be.

19:04.609 --> 19:08.714
Doing what we're doing, we all
had to leave something behind.

19:14.886 --> 19:17.723
Taylor: You're going to
get me fired with all these
long visits, okay?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.258
All right. All right,
let's go. Come on.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.994
♪<i> 'Tis the season to be jolly♪</i>

19:23.028 --> 19:25.397
Good night, guys.
Have fun.

19:30.668 --> 19:31.603
Um...

19:33.138 --> 19:35.440
-I brought you a gift.
-Really?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.376
For Christmas.

19:38.777 --> 19:39.845
It's nothing special.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.882
Thought it might
pass some time.

19:47.118 --> 19:48.654
( beeps )

19:48.687 --> 19:50.222
( jazz music playing )

20:05.670 --> 20:07.472
-Sorry, I shouldn't have...
-It's okay.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.475
Thank you.

20:11.776 --> 20:12.911
Merry Christmas, Rey.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.886
( jazz music continues )

20:37.235 --> 20:38.937
( breathes deeply )

20:45.710 --> 20:46.745
Okay.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.315
Open your eyes.

20:50.348 --> 20:52.150
What if I can't
see anything?

20:52.184 --> 20:54.586
We'll deal with it,
but we need to know.

21:13.538 --> 21:14.406
Rey...

21:15.907 --> 21:16.842
Well?

21:21.813 --> 21:22.681
I can see you.

21:23.982 --> 21:25.817
-You can?
-Yes.

21:25.850 --> 21:26.618
Uh...

21:26.651 --> 21:28.419
-How many fingers?
-Two.

21:28.452 --> 21:29.721
-How about now?
-Four.

21:30.488 --> 21:31.790
-Both eyes?
-Yeah.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.626
I mean, this one's blurrier,
but I can see out of both.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.462
-( Rey gasps )
-( laughing )

21:39.097 --> 21:41.400
Uh, pretty sure
I'm not supposed
to hug my patients.

22:02.387 --> 22:06.525
Do you know that only 8,000
people have seen this part
of the universe?

22:08.225 --> 22:10.194
Now it's 8,002.
( chuckles )

22:10.228 --> 22:11.430
Yes.

22:13.564 --> 22:16.568
-You see that?
-What?

22:17.402 --> 22:19.371
That's Alpha Centauri.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.341
So we must
be reaching the other
end of interstellar space.

22:23.374 --> 22:24.943
Not far from Thea.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.886
I wouldn't be able
to see this without you.

22:46.297 --> 22:47.632
( kisses )

23:00.978 --> 23:01.947
( sighs )

23:05.016 --> 23:06.084
Yeah, thanks.

23:15.192 --> 23:16.561
Did you...

23:16.594 --> 23:18.429
Did you see anything?

23:18.463 --> 23:21.099
When we went in to light speed?

23:21.132 --> 23:22.401
Taylor: What do you mean?

23:23.769 --> 23:24.870
I saw images.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.072
Memories.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.107
I don't know.

23:31.509 --> 23:34.512
I read about
some of SIREN's
FTL experiments.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.515
There are these things called
"Closed Timelike Curves."

23:36.548 --> 23:40.185
They're vortices of space-time
that appear at the edge of the
FTL bubble.

23:40.218 --> 23:43.755
I literally didn't understand
a word you just said.

23:43.789 --> 23:47.091
Apparently, they're like
tiny time travel machines.

23:47.124 --> 23:49.861
So in theory, you could
relive moments from your past

23:50.862 --> 23:52.197
or your future.

23:59.871 --> 24:02.606
Okay, people,
remember that deactivation

24:02.640 --> 24:05.710
is still a massive
disorientation for the body.

24:07.245 --> 24:08.146
You okay, Rey?

24:10.248 --> 24:11.949
I triple-checked.
Everything's fine.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.751
-We're slowing down,
not speeding up.
-Okay.

24:13.784 --> 24:15.454
It's not going
to be like before.

24:23.294 --> 24:24.629
Okay. (speaking in French )

24:31.836 --> 24:35.407
automated voice:
<i> The Fu Drive will be
deactivated shortly.</i>

24:35.440 --> 24:39.110
<i> All of us at SIREN wish you
a safe exit from light speed.</i>

24:47.552 --> 24:48.653
( Rey gasps )

24:51.889 --> 24:52.891
( gasps )

24:56.027 --> 24:57.361
( alarm blaring )

24:57.395 --> 24:59.097
automated voice:
<i> All Navigation Officers

24:59.130 --> 25:01.633
<i> Attention!
All Navigation Officers
to the Control Room.</i>

25:01.666 --> 25:03.300
Something's wrong.
We need to go.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.469
-What?
-Rey, we need to go now.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.239
-What's going on?
-Come on.

25:11.609 --> 25:14.179
( indistinct chattering )

25:15.980 --> 25:18.582
Sanchez: Officer Young,
what's going on?

25:18.616 --> 25:20.986
Debris tail,
it's battering us.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.299
They're penetrating
the force field!

25:34.332 --> 25:38.136
Sanchez: There must have been
a destructive event somewhere
in the solar system.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.605
There's no way we could've
predicted this.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.077
female officer:
Shit. Solar sail's been torn.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.745
They've taken out
the comms network.

25:47.778 --> 25:49.114
We've lost contact with Thea.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.188
( all groaning )

26:01.559 --> 26:03.361
-Officer.
-male officer:
Impact to Ring 10.

26:03.394 --> 26:04.462
There's a breach.

26:04.495 --> 26:05.963
-Sealant?
-female officer: Active.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.465
Closing the gap.

26:07.498 --> 26:08.766
male officer: Rupture's closed.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.468
Pressure's restoring
and stable.

26:10.501 --> 26:11.703
Backup generator's kicked in.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.237
female officer:
Damage to Cell 50.

26:13.270 --> 26:14.572
We can restore it,

26:14.605 --> 26:17.208
provided we can get
the systems back online.

26:17.241 --> 26:20.345
male officer: Captain,
we have a Code Blue in Cell 50.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.115
That's my cell.

26:25.549 --> 26:27.485
Jesus,
they've stopped breathing.

26:27.519 --> 26:28.787
Sanchez: Oh, my God!

26:29.420 --> 26:31.222
What the hell just happened?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.292
It's affecting all of them.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.063
Sanchez:
This is now a Code Red!

26:38.096 --> 26:40.364
-We have to get
down there.
-No.

26:40.397 --> 26:41.899
We follow the protocol.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.601
Frost, make an assessment.

26:43.634 --> 26:44.836
Yes, ma'am.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.872
Those are my
passengers,
Captain.

26:51.409 --> 26:52.277
Sanchez: Taylor.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.317
-Since when do we carry guns?
-Just take it.

27:01.419 --> 27:02.988
Taylor, be careful.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.756
Taylor!

27:16.300 --> 27:17.202
( glass breaks )

27:18.136 --> 27:19.170
( alarm blares )

27:20.205 --> 27:21.206
Shit!

27:27.812 --> 27:29.280
Venisha: What are we
supposed to do?

27:31.583 --> 27:32.650
You watch Rey.

27:32.683 --> 27:34.585
Wait. Is there
really a fire?

27:34.619 --> 27:36.287
Watch Rey!

27:36.320 --> 27:37.355
We'll come
back for you.

27:39.790 --> 27:41.993
( alarm continues blaring )

27:50.834 --> 27:53.505
automated voice:
<i>Attention. State of emergency.</i>

27:53.538 --> 27:55.340
<i> Please check on
your passengers.</i>

27:55.373 --> 27:57.075
-( passengers screaming )
-( banging on pods )

27:59.277 --> 28:00.811
Shit.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.281
-What do we do?
-We have to save them.

28:06.383 --> 28:08.453
( man screaming )

28:14.425 --> 28:16.027

28:20.364 --> 28:23.767
<i> All Cell Reps, please check

28:23.801 --> 28:26.271
<i> Return to the bridge
as soon as possible.</i>

28:27.972 --> 28:29.874
-( beeping )
-( indistinct shouting )

28:29.907 --> 28:31.676
Taylor:<i> Is anybody there?</i>

28:31.709 --> 28:32.877
Taylor.

28:33.877 --> 28:35.480
Taylor, can you hear me?

28:38.482 --> 28:39.784
Hello?

28:39.817 --> 28:42.487
Taylor:<i> Rey. Rey, Rey,
there's something in here.</i>

28:42.520 --> 28:43.788
-What?
<i>-There's something in Cell 50.</i>

28:43.821 --> 28:45.256
What are you talking about?

28:46.724 --> 28:48.359
Taylor, talk to me.

28:48.392 --> 28:49.928
Taylor:<i> Please, no!</i>

29:02.039 --> 29:04.208
Okay, uh, I need
your help. Captain.

29:04.241 --> 29:06.877
There's something wrong.
I think Taylor's been
attacked in Cell 50.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.247
-We've gotta help him.
-No one goes to Cell 50.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.082
Lock it down.

29:11.115 --> 29:12.917
-What?
-This is a state of emergency.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.852
We need to evacuate the<i> Origin.</i>

29:14.886 --> 29:16.721
Something has come
on board this ship.

29:16.754 --> 29:18.255
The passengers
in that cell are dead.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.358
Young, please move the ship
into evacuation.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.627
-No, no, you can't do that.
-Young, now.

29:22.660 --> 29:24.161
You can't do this!

29:24.195 --> 29:26.530
Cell Reps,
evacuate your
passengers.

29:26.564 --> 29:28.365
If you want to live,
get to a raft.

29:28.399 --> 29:30.134
Captain, he, he needs help.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.570
That cell stays
sealed, Officer.

29:32.603 --> 29:34.239
( alarm blaring )

29:34.272 --> 29:35.840
It's your duty.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.542
I'm not leaving.

29:37.575 --> 29:38.710
You have to.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.044
That's an order, Rey!

29:40.077 --> 29:42.613
male officer: Officer,
activate evacuation protocol.

29:42.646 --> 29:44.249
Sanchez:
Young, let's go.

29:48.686 --> 29:50.221

33:29.607 --> 33:30.675
Rey: Taylor?

33:36.747 --> 33:37.715
Taylor?

33:38.616 --> 33:39.584
Rey?

33:41.886 --> 33:43.221
Get out of here.

33:44.054 --> 33:45.556
Get away from me.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.060
It's inside.

33:50.093 --> 33:51.396
What do you mean?

33:52.897 --> 33:55.599
What am I supposed to do?
Tell me.

33:55.632 --> 33:56.534
Taylor: Go.

I can't control it.

We thought there was a fire.

There's no fire.

go with you.
