WEBVTT

00:03.313 --> 00:05.148
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.315 --> 00:07.525
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.692 --> 00:10.570
<i>or breathed real air,
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.237 --> 00:12.322
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.905 --> 00:15.366
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept what's left</i>

00:15.533 --> 00:19.203
<i>of the human race alive,
but now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.370 --> 00:21.873
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.457 --> 00:25.793
<i>One hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.294 --> 00:28.212
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.379 --> 00:30.632
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:32.467
<i>All we have to do is survive.</i>

00:32.634 --> 00:35.261
<i>But we will be tested,
by the Earth,</i>

00:35.428 --> 00:39.265
<i>by the secrets it hides,
and most of all, by each other.</i>

00:41.392 --> 00:42.810
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:43.144 --> 00:44.896
Prisoner 319,
take off the watch.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.397
No. It was my father's.

00:46.564 --> 00:48.483
- Mom?
- You're being sent to the ground.

00:49.567 --> 00:51.486
Clarke, I'm sorry I got
your father arrested.

00:51.653 --> 00:54.364
They didn't arrest my father, Wells.
They executed him.

00:55.114 --> 00:57.033
Atom, my sister doesn't leave
this camp.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.535
Anyone who touches her,
they answer to me.

00:59.702 --> 01:01.204
Atom.

01:03.414 --> 01:05.917
<i>Jasper was hit. They took him.</i>

01:08.169 --> 01:09.712
<i>He's alive.</i>

01:17.428 --> 01:18.971
There we go.

01:20.598 --> 01:22.725
Feel that? Feel that?

01:22.892 --> 01:24.769
- Here comes the momentum change.
- Defense.

01:25.728 --> 01:26.729
The defense is there.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.731
- Serve it up.
- Yeah!

01:29.941 --> 01:31.484
Right here, kid.

01:32.402 --> 01:34.421
- They're unbeatable.
- Prepare for crushing defeat.

01:34.445 --> 01:35.446
It's not over yet.

01:35.613 --> 01:37.615
Actually, it was over 147 years ago.

01:37.824 --> 01:38.950
A technicality.

01:39.117 --> 01:40.410
Give it up. You're going down.

01:41.577 --> 01:42.578
What'd I miss?

01:42.745 --> 01:44.956
Your husband and daughter
being obnoxious.

01:45.123 --> 01:46.124
Better play nice.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.410
Come on, get down the field.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.419
Waste of time.
Waste... hey, baby.

01:49.585 --> 01:51.045
Hi.

01:51.337 --> 01:53.297
I ran into Bennett when
I was leaving the clinic

01:53.464 --> 01:56.759
and he has that systems
analysis that you asked for.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.848
- This isn't gonna last.
- What was that about momentum?

02:02.432 --> 02:04.600
Oh, I feel the momentum.

02:05.810 --> 02:08.354
- What? You're going now?
- Just for a few minutes.

02:09.439 --> 02:12.316
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. You know this old boat.

02:12.692 --> 02:14.485
It's always something.

02:17.822 --> 02:19.449
His pulse is thready.

02:22.994 --> 02:24.620
<i>Shut that kid up!</i>

02:24.787 --> 02:26.122
<i>Quiet!</i>

02:27.498 --> 02:28.666
Don't listen to them.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.668
You're gonna
make it through this, okay?

02:30.877 --> 02:32.170
Promise.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.130
<i>Can he just die already?</i>

02:35.631 --> 02:37.717
I'm gonna get clean water.
Keep an eye on him.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.024
No!

02:54.859 --> 02:56.068
No!

02:56.944 --> 02:58.529
No! No!

03:05.620 --> 03:08.706
Hey, wake up.
It's okay. It's okay.

03:09.707 --> 03:11.000
It's just a dream.

03:11.918 --> 03:13.336
You're Charlotte, right?

03:14.212 --> 03:15.463
I'm Clarke.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.091
It's okay to be scared.

03:20.259 --> 03:21.719
Do you want to talk about it?

03:24.972 --> 03:29.143
It's... my parents.

03:32.188 --> 03:33.898
They were floated and they...

03:34.065 --> 03:36.400
I see it in my dreams
and I just...

03:36.567 --> 03:38.152
I understand.

03:39.695 --> 03:41.322
My dad was floated, too.

03:46.619 --> 03:48.329
So, how did you end up here?

03:51.624 --> 03:55.586
Well... they were taking
my parents' things

03:55.753 --> 04:00.049
to the redistribution center
and I kind of lost it.

04:02.802 --> 04:04.595
They said I assaulted a guard.

04:05.596 --> 04:07.223
I can't say I blame you.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.401
See that bright star up there?

04:20.069 --> 04:22.196
That's the Ark orbiting above us.

04:22.655 --> 04:27.535
I think whatever happened up there,
you know, the pain...

04:29.287 --> 04:31.747
...maybe we can move past that now.

04:32.999 --> 04:36.794
Maybe being on the ground
is our second chance.

04:39.297 --> 04:41.048
Do you really believe that?

04:43.593 --> 04:45.136
I'm trying to.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.165
I think this is north. Come on.

05:14.332 --> 05:16.012
Really? Because we just came
from that way,

05:16.167 --> 05:17.835
Miss I-Can-Navigate-With-The-Stars.

05:18.002 --> 05:20.046
It's your fault we've
been lost for two days.

05:20.212 --> 05:22.048
Never should've gone off
by ourselves.

05:22.214 --> 05:25.009
Come on.
We'll find the dropship tomorrow.

05:25.509 --> 05:28.054
That's what you said last night.
And I'm hungry.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.681
Trina, relax. We're fine.

05:33.851 --> 05:35.353
Did you feel that?

05:37.772 --> 05:39.148
What is that?

05:40.107 --> 05:41.484
I don't know.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.152
I don't know.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.575
I can't see!

05:50.117 --> 05:52.662
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, my God, it burns!

06:05.967 --> 06:08.010
That damn kid,
always messing with my head.

06:08.177 --> 06:11.472
He's not gonna last much longer.
Better think of a new excuse.

06:11.931 --> 06:12.932
That's how it's done.

06:13.099 --> 06:14.619
We searched a half-mile
all directions.

06:14.725 --> 06:16.978
No sign of Trina or Pascal.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.063
Visit your special tree
when you were out there?

06:19.772 --> 06:21.857
Atom took his punishment.
Let it go.

06:22.191 --> 06:23.609
Could be Grounders.

06:23.776 --> 06:26.654
Yeah, or they could be in pound town.

06:27.071 --> 06:28.656
A lot of that going around recently.

06:35.413 --> 06:39.041
Look, Bellamy, people are scared,
and that dying kid,

06:39.208 --> 06:40.727
he's not helping the morale
around here.

06:40.751 --> 06:42.479
Morale will go up when
I find them more food.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.398
And what do we say when they
ask about Trina and Pascal?

06:44.422 --> 06:47.675
Now? Nothing.
It's possible they're just lost.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.945
We'll keep an eye out for them
when we go hunting later.

06:49.969 --> 06:51.846
Let's go kill something.

06:52.013 --> 06:53.264
You're not going.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.849
I need you to stay here.

06:55.141 --> 06:56.341
If the Grounders are circling,

06:56.475 --> 06:58.185
we can't leave this place
unprotected.

06:58.769 --> 07:02.106
Fine. Somebody better tell
goggle boy to keep it shut.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.873
The Grounders cauterized the wound.
Saved his life.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.459
Saved his life so they could
string him up for live bait.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.462
Garden of Eden this ain't.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.964
This is infected.
He could be septic.

07:28.174 --> 07:30.634
Any progress on using the wristbands
to contact the Ark?

07:31.802 --> 07:33.137
Monty?

07:33.888 --> 07:35.473
That would be a firm no.

07:37.058 --> 07:38.338
My mother would know what to do.

07:38.476 --> 07:39.477
How's he doing?

07:39.643 --> 07:41.121
How does it look like he's
doing, Wells?

07:41.145 --> 07:42.772
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

07:47.485 --> 07:48.861
Right. You want to help?

07:50.112 --> 07:51.614
Hold him down.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.581
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

08:07.171 --> 08:08.506
Hey.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.258
I could really use a break
from this place.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.032
What do you say you and me take
a trip to the butterfly field?

08:14.678 --> 08:15.930
Huh?

08:17.056 --> 08:18.641
Am I being too subtle?

08:20.351 --> 08:21.644
Atom.

08:28.901 --> 08:31.779
- With weapons...
- What did you do to Atom?

08:37.243 --> 08:38.327
Atom's fine.

08:38.494 --> 08:39.614
Then why did he blow me off?

08:39.703 --> 08:40.931
Maybe he's just not interested.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.623
You can't keep everyone away from me.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.251
Atom had to learn.
You disobey me, you pay the price.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.877
He paid the price.
Now we're good.

08:47.044 --> 08:48.379
Now I'm paying the price.

08:48.838 --> 08:50.923
So, next time you decide
to go on a power trip,

08:51.090 --> 08:52.383
leave me out of it.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.222
Hold him still.

08:58.556 --> 09:00.599
I need to cut away
the infected flesh.

09:04.562 --> 09:06.313
Stop it! You're killing him.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.680
She's trying to save his life.

09:07.731 --> 09:09.108
She can't.

09:11.277 --> 09:12.278
Back off.

09:12.444 --> 09:14.673
We didn't drag him through miles
of woods just to let him die.

09:14.697 --> 09:16.907
Kid's a goner. If you can't
see that, you're deluded.

09:17.241 --> 09:18.325
He's making people crazy.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.995
Sorry if Jasper's
an inconvenience to you,

09:21.162 --> 09:24.123
but this isn't the Ark.
Down here, every life matters.

09:24.290 --> 09:28.210
Take a look at him.
He's a lost cause.

09:35.217 --> 09:38.637
Octavia, I've spent my whole life
watching my mother heal people.

09:38.804 --> 09:40.244
If I say there's hope, there's hope.

09:40.306 --> 09:42.766
This isn't about hope,
it's about guts.

09:42.933 --> 09:45.603
You don't have the guts
to make the hard choices. I do.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.479
He's been like this for three days.

09:47.646 --> 09:50.774
If he's not better by tomorrow,
I'll kill him myself.

09:52.902 --> 09:54.778
Octavia, let's go.

09:56.989 --> 09:58.449
I'm staying here.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.788
Power-hungry, self-serving jackass.

10:05.331 --> 10:07.124
He doesn't care about
anyone but himself.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.127
No offense.

10:11.629 --> 10:14.381
Yeah. Bellamy is all that.

10:15.841 --> 10:17.509
But he also happens to be right.

10:35.110 --> 10:36.528
How'd it go?

10:37.821 --> 10:38.822
Hey.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.993
Well, I told Jaha it's definitive.

10:43.953 --> 10:46.747
The Ark's got a year of
oxygen left, maybe two.

10:46.997 --> 10:48.499
You'll fix it.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.584
Not this time.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.337
I've tried, Abby.
This isn't a glitch.

10:54.672 --> 10:56.465
It's a system failure.

10:59.176 --> 11:00.594
People need to know.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.846
No. They'll panic.

11:03.681 --> 11:05.975
- You sound like Kane.
- Because he's right.

11:06.141 --> 11:09.895
No. No, we can't avoid the truth.

11:10.062 --> 11:12.622
We have to let everyone on the Ark
put their minds to a solution.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.859
What, and risk anarchy?
No. It's too dangerous.

11:18.195 --> 11:20.531
Promise me that you'll
obey the council's orders,

11:20.739 --> 11:22.157
that you'll keep it quiet.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.035
Promise me.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.043
I can't.

11:36.297 --> 11:39.049
For Clarke. Do it for Clarke.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.472
I am doing this for Clarke.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.064
They'll float you, Jake.

11:54.773 --> 11:58.152
If you do this,
I won't be able to stop it.

12:07.369 --> 12:08.746
You're mad.

12:10.039 --> 12:11.415
I'm not mad.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.084
You want to think Jasper's
a lost cause, go ahead.

12:14.251 --> 12:16.337
- You're wrong.
- I hope I am.

12:16.503 --> 12:20.883
Whatever this stuff is, it has
to have had antibiotic properties.

12:22.926 --> 12:24.428
Let me take a look.

12:26.221 --> 12:29.725
Before you refuse my help, remember
who aced botany in Earth skills.

12:31.435 --> 12:34.104
The Grounders used it as a poultice.

12:34.772 --> 12:36.612
I'm thinking a tea might
be even more effective

12:36.648 --> 12:38.108
if we can figure out what it is.

12:38.275 --> 12:40.194
I know what it is. Seaweed.

12:40.861 --> 12:41.987
Look, no root structure.

12:42.154 --> 12:44.239
Well, then there must
be a water source nearby.

12:44.406 --> 12:46.426
Yeah, it would have to have
a slow current, lots of rocks.

12:46.450 --> 12:48.577
The water would probably be
more red than green.

12:48.744 --> 12:49.912
I know just the place.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.122
All right. Let's go.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.419
Hey. I know what this
stuff looks like. Do you?

13:02.132 --> 13:03.842
You know, you should, uh,

13:04.009 --> 13:06.428
really rethink this
whole hating me thing.

13:06.595 --> 13:08.389
It's not just the Grounders.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.141
We're surrounded by criminals.
We need each other.

13:11.308 --> 13:12.601
We're gonna be friends again.

13:12.935 --> 13:16.063
You got my dad killed.
Not possible.

13:17.606 --> 13:20.734
This is Earth, Clarke.
Anything's possible.

13:25.948 --> 13:27.366
I'd let it go.

13:27.866 --> 13:29.243
Yeah.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.180
Well, I've known Clarke her
whole life better than you ever will,

13:32.204 --> 13:33.431
so, I'll decide when to let it go.

13:33.455 --> 13:34.895
Yeah, I can tell you guys are close.

13:39.837 --> 13:41.296
What is it?

13:49.680 --> 13:51.265
- It's an automobile.
- Come on, guys.

13:51.432 --> 13:53.892
This thing's been here 100 years.
All right? It can wait.

13:54.059 --> 13:55.352
Jasper can't.

14:12.244 --> 14:13.954
She's mine.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.335
Get her.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.339
Who the hell are you?

14:24.506 --> 14:25.507
Charlotte.

14:25.674 --> 14:27.009
I almost killed you.

14:28.469 --> 14:29.636
Why aren't you back at camp?

14:30.387 --> 14:32.389
What with that guy who was dying,

14:32.556 --> 14:34.516
I just...
I couldn't listen anymore.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.243
There's Grounders out here.
It's too dangerous for a little girl.

14:37.394 --> 14:38.729
I'm not little.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.234
Okay, then...

14:44.943 --> 14:47.571
But you can't hunt without a weapon.

14:52.242 --> 14:53.660
Ever killed something before?

14:56.205 --> 14:58.373
Who knows?
Maybe you're good at it.

15:05.881 --> 15:07.716
So, what does this seaweed
look like?

15:12.095 --> 15:13.096
Like that.

15:13.263 --> 15:15.183
Hey, that thing that
bit Octavia, how big was it?

15:15.307 --> 15:18.560
Big. We could rig this
into some kind of a net.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.813
Find something to lower it
into the water.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.235
Or we could just do that.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.377
Let's get out of here.

15:49.258 --> 15:50.968
- Grounders?
- It could be a war cry.

15:51.260 --> 15:52.678
...or a warning.

15:59.351 --> 16:00.978
What the hell is that?

16:02.854 --> 16:04.481
Run. Run!

16:15.826 --> 16:16.952
Clarke.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.830
You're up.

16:20.998 --> 16:22.332
Clarke.

16:22.624 --> 16:23.959
Sorry.

16:28.171 --> 16:31.174
Well, if your strategy
is to lose really fast,

16:31.341 --> 16:33.093
that was a great move.

16:34.678 --> 16:36.054
What's going on?

16:36.805 --> 16:38.015
Nothing.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.101
You can talk to me.

16:49.026 --> 16:51.278
My dad found a problem
with the oxygen system.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.656
- I'm not supposed to know.
- They've had other malfunctions.

16:54.823 --> 16:56.175
They always figure out a way
to deal with it.

16:56.199 --> 16:58.327
No. This one might not be fixable.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.040
The council doesn't want
anyone to know.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.751
The council meaning my dad?

17:05.916 --> 17:08.712
Yeah. And my mom and the others.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.714
I think he's gonna go public anyway.

17:11.882 --> 17:13.467
Clarke, he can't.
He'll get floated.

17:13.634 --> 17:14.968
I know.

17:17.387 --> 17:18.722
But what if he's right?

17:20.766 --> 17:22.726
Don't people deserve
to know the truth?

17:24.185 --> 17:27.564
You can't tell your dad I told you.
You can't tell anyone.

17:27.731 --> 17:29.399
Your secret's safe with me.

17:30.442 --> 17:31.485
I promise.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.198
Clarke, run!

17:46.416 --> 17:48.043
It's getting inside.

17:48.210 --> 17:49.419
Seal up any openings.

17:55.592 --> 17:57.594
Come on!
There are caves this way.

18:13.235 --> 18:14.736
Bellamy!

18:16.905 --> 18:18.115
Bellamy!

18:22.869 --> 18:24.287
- What's going on?
- Air got thick,

18:24.454 --> 18:26.039
everybody's skin started burning.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.958
Monty, my brother's out there.

18:28.792 --> 18:31.628
He'll be fine.
We'll all be fine.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.303
It's still out there.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.906
Look, We should
just make a run for it.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.682
Jasper can't wait much longer.

18:43.849 --> 18:46.518
Us dying in a cloud of acid fog
isn't gonna help Jasper.

18:51.606 --> 18:53.191
- Is that...
- Booze.

18:53.734 --> 18:56.319
Hooch. Rotgut.

19:04.703 --> 19:07.539
Well, careful.
Finn, it could be...

19:07.706 --> 19:09.207
Whiskey, I think.

19:09.374 --> 19:11.126
Better than the moonshine
on Agro Station.

19:12.753 --> 19:13.837
Alcohol's toxic.

19:14.004 --> 19:15.672
This is Earth.
Everything's toxic.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.438
Plus, it's a time-honored
rite of passage.

19:18.508 --> 19:19.926
We'll pass.

19:22.304 --> 19:24.556
Far be it from me to stand
in the way of tradition.

19:35.484 --> 19:36.860
No!

19:38.737 --> 19:40.197
Charlotte, wake up.

19:40.864 --> 19:42.282
I'm sorry.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.202
Does it happen often?

19:47.078 --> 19:48.538
What are you scared of?

19:50.749 --> 19:53.251
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.214
The only thing that matters
is what you do about it.

19:58.256 --> 20:00.717
But, I'm asleep.

20:01.384 --> 20:02.928
Fears are fears.

20:03.845 --> 20:06.056
Slay your demons when you're awake,

20:06.223 --> 20:08.266
they won't be there
to get you when you sleep.

20:09.017 --> 20:11.895
Yeah, but, how?

20:12.062 --> 20:13.605
You can't afford to be weak.

20:13.772 --> 20:17.734
Down here, weakness is death,
fear is death.

20:23.824 --> 20:25.784
Let me see that knife I gave you.

20:30.038 --> 20:33.208
Now, when you feel afraid,
you hold tight to that knife

20:33.375 --> 20:37.420
and you say, "screw you. I'm not afraid."

20:43.134 --> 20:46.471
Screw you. I'm not afraid.

20:53.603 --> 20:56.648
Screw you. I'm not afraid.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.402
Slay your demons, kid.

21:01.319 --> 21:02.821
Then you'll be able to sleep.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.661
It's been hours. Jasper...

21:09.828 --> 21:13.039
Is in good hands.
Octavia will take care of him.

21:13.915 --> 21:17.669
While we're on the subject,
why is it that everyone

21:17.836 --> 21:22.173
thinks me wanting Jasper
to not die is a bad thing?

21:22.340 --> 21:25.468
Like I'm such a downer.
I can be fun.

21:26.761 --> 21:29.472
Yeah. You think I'm fun. Right?

21:29.806 --> 21:31.308
Oh, yeah. Among other things.

21:31.474 --> 21:33.143
You're fun.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.730
You remember that time...

21:36.897 --> 21:39.649
Remember that time you betrayed me
and got my father executed?

21:43.069 --> 21:44.487
Yeah, I remember.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.991
Where were we? Fun.

21:48.283 --> 21:49.534
Yeah.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.871
Well, since you brought it up,
and I didn't,

21:53.038 --> 21:57.792
because I don't want to talk
about it, what were you thinking?

22:01.963 --> 22:03.506
I made a mistake, Clarke.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.511
"I made a mistake, Clarke."

22:11.222 --> 22:12.933
Not good enough.

22:16.353 --> 22:20.941
You know, I bet you couldn't wait
to run to daddy.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.401
Tell him everything
so that he'd finally believe

22:23.568 --> 22:25.171
you were the perfect son
he always wanted.

22:25.195 --> 22:26.821
What do you want me to say?

22:26.988 --> 22:28.698
I want an explanation.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.667
I can't give you one.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.128
I thought I could trust him.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.843
Well, I thought I could
trust my best friend.

22:49.594 --> 22:51.054
Guess we were both wrong.

22:51.221 --> 22:52.222
I'm still your friend.

22:52.389 --> 22:55.558
No, you're not.
If you were my friend,

22:55.725 --> 22:58.103
you would walk out into that fog
and never come back.

23:01.564 --> 23:05.610
Okay, how about we just...
take it easy.

23:07.779 --> 23:09.781
I have no idea how to do that.

23:25.463 --> 23:27.132
So, we having fun yet?

23:31.928 --> 23:33.972
That kid's driving me nuts.

23:35.932 --> 23:37.726
Can't take this much longer.

23:44.441 --> 23:46.276
That's it. I'm ending this.

23:47.318 --> 23:48.945
I heard Bellamy gave him
till tomorrow.

23:49.112 --> 23:51.573
Yeah, well, Bellamy isn't here,
is he?

23:51.740 --> 23:53.992
The kid's dying anyway.
I'm just getting it over with.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.456
Murphy's going to kill Jasper!

24:04.294 --> 24:05.670
The lock's on the other side.

24:06.629 --> 24:07.630
Don't let him in!

24:07.797 --> 24:09.257
I'm gonna kill him, okay?
Let me in!

24:09.466 --> 24:11.009
Let me in, Monty!

24:13.136 --> 24:14.846
No rush. I'm fine here.

24:15.597 --> 24:16.931
I got it!

24:18.099 --> 24:19.392
Do it!

24:19.642 --> 24:21.728
Monty, you better
open up this hatch right now!

24:27.233 --> 24:32.447
<i>In this time of uncertainty,
we will come together as a people.</i>

24:33.114 --> 24:36.659
<i>I'm telling you this because
you must know the truth</i>

24:36.826 --> 24:40.789
and because I want a future
for my child and yours.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.501
Be strong.

24:45.001 --> 24:46.753
You're gonna
disobey the council?

24:52.133 --> 24:54.677
Dad, I know.
I heard you and Mom.

24:55.386 --> 24:56.846
Okay, you know.

24:57.722 --> 24:59.432
I've been thinking about this
a long time.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.560
The people have a right to know.
Your mother doesn't understand.

25:02.727 --> 25:04.020
What's the plan?

25:05.355 --> 25:06.773
You don't need to know the plan.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.275
You're making a video, so, what?

25:09.442 --> 25:12.487
You're gonna break into
the communications mainframe?

25:14.823 --> 25:17.534
Making you either suicidal
or incredibly dumb.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.870
Wow. You are picking a fine moment

25:21.037 --> 25:22.872
to start behaving
like a typical teenager.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.375
- I'm gonna help you.
- No. No, Clarke, you're not.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.502
- But I can...
- Absolutely not.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.757
No. No, baby.

25:36.386 --> 25:38.847
You get that stubborn streak
from your mother, you know.

25:39.222 --> 25:41.850
One of many things
I love about both of you.

25:42.851 --> 25:44.651
Jake Griffin,
you're under arrest for treason.

25:44.936 --> 25:46.146
Dad? Dad?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.356
No, no, no.

25:48.523 --> 25:49.649
Get your hands off of her.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.234
Let me go!

25:52.610 --> 25:54.237
I'll warn them. I'll find a way.

25:54.404 --> 25:57.240
No, Clarke, no, listen to me.
Do not. Do not do that.

25:57.407 --> 25:59.826
Get off of me! Let me go!

26:00.410 --> 26:03.246
Let me go! Dad! Dad!

26:06.958 --> 26:09.085
The fog's cleared. Come on.

26:15.592 --> 26:17.260
Let's go. Jasper's waiting.

26:29.606 --> 26:31.065
Last night was pretty intense.

26:32.192 --> 26:33.276
You and Clarke ever...

26:33.443 --> 26:35.612
No. Not like that.

26:38.198 --> 26:39.866
So, help me out.

26:41.618 --> 26:44.245
Your best friend tells you
something fairly explosive.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.515
You seem like the type of guy
that'd keep it to yourself.

26:46.539 --> 26:47.749
You don't know me.

26:47.916 --> 26:49.292
Why'd you do it?

26:51.544 --> 26:53.171
I don't know.
Why do you care?

26:55.048 --> 26:57.133
You knew what the rules were
on the Ark.

26:57.967 --> 26:59.969
You had to know her dad
would get floated.

27:01.971 --> 27:03.348
I made a choice.

27:03.932 --> 27:05.367
If she hates me for the
rest of my life,

27:05.391 --> 27:07.631
I made the right choice,
and that's all you have to know.

27:15.443 --> 27:16.819
It's all clear.

27:20.031 --> 27:21.658
Anybody out here?

27:22.742 --> 27:23.785
Jones?

27:23.952 --> 27:25.328
<i>We're here!</i>

27:29.082 --> 27:31.376
Lost you in the stew.
Where'd you go?

27:31.542 --> 27:33.002
Made it to a cave down there.

27:33.169 --> 27:34.170
The hell was that?

27:34.337 --> 27:36.089
- I don't know.
- Where is Atom?

27:42.220 --> 27:45.056
Trapped in a 100-year-old car
by toxic fog.

27:47.183 --> 27:49.018
Last night was pretty...

27:49.185 --> 27:52.146
What's the word? Fun.

27:53.398 --> 27:56.359
It wasn't fun.
It was irresponsible.

27:56.526 --> 27:58.286
We should've left
the second the fog cleared.

27:58.528 --> 27:59.529
Even if the fog cleared,

27:59.696 --> 28:02.115
we'd never make it back
through these woods at night.

28:03.866 --> 28:05.743
You were kind of rough on Wells.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.370
Hardly.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.248
He's a pretty straight-up guy.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.668
And he loves you.
You know that, right?

28:15.712 --> 28:20.341
But every time your dad comes up,
he won't give you a straight answer.

28:21.592 --> 28:23.344
Makes me think he's hiding something.

28:24.846 --> 28:26.764
So, I gotta ask you.

28:26.931 --> 28:29.642
How sure are you that Wells
is the one who turned in your dad?

28:30.560 --> 28:33.896
100 percent. All right?
He's the only one I told.

28:36.858 --> 28:37.984
Is he the only one who knew?

28:46.409 --> 28:47.910
Who was that?

28:59.172 --> 29:01.507
Son of a bitch. Atom.

29:14.645 --> 29:18.441
Kill me. Kill me.

29:47.637 --> 29:50.306
I... can't... breathe.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.815
Don't be afraid.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.444
Go back to camp.

30:06.155 --> 30:08.157
Charlotte, you too.

30:16.666 --> 30:18.167
Kill me.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.389
Please, please.

30:47.196 --> 30:48.239
I heard screams.

30:48.406 --> 30:50.032
Charlotte found him.

30:51.033 --> 30:52.577
I sent her back to camp.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.637
Okay.

31:13.347 --> 31:15.516
I'm gonna help you, all right?

32:13.282 --> 32:14.367
<i>Hey, everyone they're back.</i>

32:15.785 --> 32:17.620
We've gotta get to Jasper.

32:17.787 --> 32:19.789
I'll need boiled water
to make the medicine.

32:25.294 --> 32:26.963
Get Clarke whatever she needs.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.633
I better go get this grave dug.

32:31.634 --> 32:34.637
It's about time.
They're gonna kill Jasper.

32:34.804 --> 32:36.564
- Did you get the medicine?
- Yeah. I got it.

32:36.597 --> 32:38.140
Come on. Let's go talk.

32:39.934 --> 32:43.271
Octavia, just stay there.
Please, stay back.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.439
Stop.

32:52.113 --> 32:53.489
Atom.

32:55.366 --> 32:57.285
- There's nothing I could do.
- Don't.

33:09.505 --> 33:11.465
- Oh, please.
- Don't.

33:17.471 --> 33:18.931
Lose anyone here?

33:19.557 --> 33:20.766
No.

33:21.392 --> 33:22.643
Jasper?

33:22.810 --> 33:23.853
Still breathing. Barely.

33:24.020 --> 33:26.439
I tried to take him out,
but your psycho little sister...

33:27.356 --> 33:29.525
- Bellamy.
- My what? My what?

33:30.776 --> 33:32.194
Your little sister.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.240
Yeah, that's right.
My little sister.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.328
Got anything else you
want to say about her?

33:42.747 --> 33:44.165
Nothing.

33:45.082 --> 33:46.584
Sorry.

33:51.672 --> 33:53.299
Get him out of here.

34:22.495 --> 34:23.788
Hey, baby.

34:30.628 --> 34:32.213
You have to warn them, Abby.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.090
Jake, stop.

34:34.590 --> 34:36.926
The Ark's dying.
There's no choice.

34:37.092 --> 34:38.427
Yes, there is.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.222
There's Earth.

34:43.933 --> 34:45.601
We'll at least have a chance.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.902
Here. Hang on to that.

34:57.530 --> 35:01.659
And give this to Clarke
and tell her that I...

35:01.826 --> 35:02.910
Dad!

35:03.160 --> 35:06.455
Clarke, you shouldn't be here,
honey. You don't want to see this.

35:07.456 --> 35:08.916
It's okay.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.637
It's okay. It's okay.

35:22.805 --> 35:25.474
Here. Keep that for me.

35:28.185 --> 35:29.812
Jake, it's time.

35:37.862 --> 35:39.405
I love you, kid.

35:39.655 --> 35:40.906
I love you.

35:59.008 --> 36:00.342
Okay.

36:03.679 --> 36:05.264
Oh, my God.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.770
I'm so sorry.

36:12.229 --> 36:14.857
Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.464
I'm really sorry about Atom.

36:43.135 --> 36:44.654
I guess we're gonna have to
get used to

36:44.678 --> 36:46.472
people dying down here, aren't we?

36:48.724 --> 36:51.310
But not you.
You hear me?

36:51.727 --> 36:53.312
You're not allowed to die.

37:05.157 --> 37:06.534
Wells?

37:12.206 --> 37:16.085
I know I probably don't deserve it,
but I need to know the truth.

37:19.255 --> 37:22.216
It was my mom.
Wasn't it?

37:24.677 --> 37:26.428
She's the one who told your dad.

37:30.099 --> 37:32.017
I didn't want to believe it.
I...

37:33.018 --> 37:34.478
I couldn't.

37:35.479 --> 37:37.356
I blamed you because
my father's dead

37:37.523 --> 37:39.483
and it's my mother's fault.

37:41.277 --> 37:42.653
Isn't it?

37:44.864 --> 37:47.825
Wells, please.

37:53.873 --> 37:55.541
I knew how you would feel.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.921
- I wanted to...
- To protect me.

38:08.971 --> 38:10.598
So, you let me hate you.

38:12.266 --> 38:13.809
What are friends for?

38:15.352 --> 38:17.146
How can you forgive me?

38:20.065 --> 38:21.734
That is already done.

38:39.001 --> 38:40.461
Smooth.

38:51.388 --> 38:53.557
Disgusting. Love it.

38:56.185 --> 38:59.480
Can I get a hit of that?

38:59.605 --> 39:00.648
Jasper!

39:00.814 --> 39:03.442
Let's start with the soft stuff.

39:09.990 --> 39:11.533
Welcome back, buddy.

39:16.956 --> 39:19.541
Was that a dream
or did I get speared?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.462
You'll have a very
impressive scar to prove it.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.089
My savior.

39:26.215 --> 39:28.550
Thank you for not dying.

39:30.010 --> 39:32.012
I don't think I could've
taken that today.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.975
I'll try not to die tomorrow,
too, if that's cool.

39:39.728 --> 39:41.313
Oh, hello.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.544
Hi.

40:04.253 --> 40:05.587
Couldn't sleep?

40:06.505 --> 40:07.923
I never can.

40:09.258 --> 40:10.592
You on watch?

40:11.260 --> 40:12.720
Join me.

40:19.393 --> 40:20.853
I had a nightmare.

40:24.773 --> 40:26.483
I have them every night.

40:28.986 --> 40:34.450
But... I think I found
a way to make them stop.

40:37.786 --> 40:39.246
I'm sorry.

40:40.748 --> 40:42.124
No!

41:00.642 --> 41:02.686
Every night, I see him.

41:04.313 --> 41:05.773
Your father.

41:06.899 --> 41:10.861
He kills my parents and...
And I see his face

41:11.028 --> 41:13.906
and I wake up and I see yours.

41:16.075 --> 41:18.077
And the nightmare never ends.

41:19.161 --> 41:23.499
The only way to make it end
was to slay my demons.

41:25.793 --> 41:27.336
I had to.
