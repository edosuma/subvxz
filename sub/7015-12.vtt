00:06.156 --> 00:06.723
Hey,

00:07.611 --> 00:09.271
Still mad at me about
the Christmas party?

00:09.299 --> 00:12.613
No. I'm just starting to realize you might
never be the man I dreamed you'd be.

00:12.784 --> 00:14.809
That's the spirit.
Lower your expectations.

00:17.423 --> 00:17.934
Well,

00:18.606 --> 00:20.689
I have one last
wedding thing to return,

00:20.821 --> 00:25.470
And once this is done, the only thing I'll have left
to remind me we almost got married will be you.

00:25.498 --> 00:26.398
Oh...

00:28.243 --> 00:30.942
Well, I wish Eric had
shown up for your wedding.

00:31.017 --> 00:35.322
The sales lady said my mother-Of-The-Groom
dress took 5 pounds off me.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.631
5 pounds!

00:39.134 --> 00:41.755
Okay, what happened
to my nice breakfast?

00:41.784 --> 00:43.820
I thought we were done with
this whole wedding deal.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.572
Women are never
done with it, son.

00:45.985 --> 00:47.548
Anything wrong you do,

00:47.571 --> 00:50.578
They sit on it for
25 years like an egg,

00:51.916 --> 00:54.674
And then it hatches
on super bowl sunday.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.635
Oh, man, I can't believe I have to take
these shoes back to Wanamaker bridal.

01:01.943 --> 01:05.447
Now I have to tell that snot Stacy
Wanamaker that I didn't get married.

01:05.683 --> 01:08.213
Oh, Donna, I'll take
them back for you.

01:08.248 --> 01:10.580
I've always wanted
to meet Stacy Wanamaker.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.699
I mean, she's everything
I've ever wanted to be...

01:12.723 --> 01:16.095
Gorgeous, popular, which,
of course, I already am,

01:16.131 --> 01:18.770
But she's also married

01:18.995 --> 01:22.960
And to a guy who owns a real estate
company that puts her face on his signs.

01:24.511 --> 01:26.654
Oh, she's like
a Kennedy.

01:28.619 --> 01:31.066
Yeah, Stacy Wanamaker
was a high school legend.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.386
All the guys would say,
"I do...

01:33.422 --> 01:34.676
Wanna make her."

01:35.481 --> 01:38.050
I always wish I had a name
that could be done to.

01:38.831 --> 01:40.798
Jackie has
a nice rackie?

01:43.745 --> 01:46.113
I like Jackie
on her backie?

01:52.123 --> 01:53.496
Oh... thanks,
you guys.

02:02.194 --> 02:04.017
Well, thanks for dinner.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.196
Thanks for dessert.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.895
Thanks for breakfast.

02:09.084 --> 02:10.812
Thanks for dessert.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.595
Congratulations, Angie.

02:16.797 --> 02:19.081
You just got four different
kinds of herpes.

02:21.046 --> 02:23.234
Hey, Hyde, I just learned
something very important.

02:23.258 --> 02:25.803
You know that saying,
it's like kissing your sister?

02:25.839 --> 02:29.556
Well, it's totally wrong 'cause
kissing your sister is great.

02:35.058 --> 02:37.414
Oh, oh, there's
Stacy Wanamaker.

02:37.627 --> 02:38.728
Hi.

02:38.763 --> 02:40.816
I'm here to
return these shoes.

02:40.886 --> 02:43.308
- Name?
- Donna Pinciotti.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.247
Good heavens,
these are for a giant.

02:47.749 --> 02:49.205
Were they too big?

02:49.240 --> 02:51.665
Oh, no, no.
The wedding was canceled.

02:51.831 --> 02:54.127
Yeah, the groom said,
"I don't."

02:55.974 --> 02:58.436
Oh, Donna, how awful.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.678
What? Oh, no, no. I--

02:59.714 --> 03:02.590
I just know how complete
being married has made me,

03:02.602 --> 03:07.621
And I always feel so sad when I see girls your age
whose window to find that kind of happiness

03:07.667 --> 03:10.094
Is so, so small.

03:11.384 --> 03:13.430
It is not that small.

03:14.661 --> 03:20.722
Honey, I've seen a lot of girls like you who
wasted years on a guy who never came through,

03:20.758 --> 03:24.698
And before you know it, you're
past your expiration date.

03:25.847 --> 03:29.351
Well, that is not gonna
happen to me because...

03:30.369 --> 03:32.296
I'm still getting married.

03:32.414 --> 03:36.309
Yeah, see, I canceled the other
wedding 'cause I traded in... Up.

03:36.451 --> 03:37.469
- Him.
- Who?

03:37.503 --> 03:38.343
- You.
- What?

03:38.379 --> 03:39.208
Yes.

03:41.066 --> 03:43.564
This is Eduardo
and he's, um...

03:44.712 --> 03:46.309
A prince.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.695
He's the prince of Mexico.

03:53.944 --> 03:58.799
Well, then we are going to make your
wedding the best wedding ever, right, Donna?

03:59.616 --> 04:00.480
Donna?

04:02.244 --> 04:04.943
- Apparently, that's you.
- Oh, yes. What? Yes.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.895
You just have to come to the big
wedding expo this weekend.

04:10.930 --> 04:15.168
Oh, well, that sounds great.
Eduardo and I would love to be there.

04:16.849 --> 04:18.185
Right, Eduardo?

04:18.576 --> 04:21.796
Just a few weeks left to
stretch those wings, huh, toots?

04:23.536 --> 04:24.708
Eduardo!

04:25.016 --> 04:27.465
What? Oh, yes,
my bride. Yes.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.712
Hey.

05:09.111 --> 05:13.101
Oh, Hyde, Angie can't make it
to the movie with you because, uh...

05:13.547 --> 05:15.978
Well, I plumb
wore her out.

05:18.126 --> 05:18.938
Kelso,

05:20.113 --> 05:21.839
Jackie and i are
fighting right now

05:21.897 --> 05:23.447
And I'm in a
really bad mood,

05:23.576 --> 05:27.451
So if you don't stop nailing my sister, I'm gonna
have to smack you in the head with my car.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.196
Actually, you can't do
anything to me because

05:31.269 --> 05:36.466
Because after you stole Jackie from me, we made a
pact not to interfere with each other's pursuit of a chick.

05:40.477 --> 05:42.015
I negotiated the pact,

05:42.414 --> 05:46.489
Which mainly consisted of Kelso
telling me to tell Hyde to sit on it.

05:48.327 --> 05:51.427
How come you guys always have pacts?
You never give me a pact.

05:52.566 --> 05:53.822
I want a pact.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.213
Well, I would love
to stick around and chat,

05:59.248 --> 06:03.111
But I gotta go home and take a shower
'cause Hyde's sister wears a lot of perfume,

06:03.134 --> 06:04.990
And she was
all over me.

06:09.008 --> 06:10.546
Friggin' pact.

06:12.108 --> 06:13.270
You know, Hyde,

06:14.010 --> 06:15.771
This doesn't have to
be a problem.

06:16.487 --> 06:19.604
I happen to know a lot of
ways out of a pact, my friend.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.032
That's true.

06:23.443 --> 06:26.907
We once had a pact to get married,
but then he just didn't show up.

06:33.469 --> 06:35.348
So you think you can get her
to break up with him?

06:35.442 --> 06:36.182
Maybe,

06:36.346 --> 06:40.371
But that would require you and I going
into business together, I.E. Forming a pact,

06:41.592 --> 06:43.494
Which would mean

06:43.706 --> 06:45.103
You gotta do
something for me.

06:45.631 --> 06:46.873
I don't think so, man.

06:48.423 --> 06:49.938
This is a starter pact.

06:52.709 --> 06:53.989
You handle this,

06:54.987 --> 06:56.471
You get a
big-Boy pact.

06:58.526 --> 07:00.511
I don't know, Eric.
A starter pact?

07:00.546 --> 07:04.561
I mean, that sounds a lot like training wheels,
and you were on those for a really long time.

07:07.703 --> 07:09.069
Stacy, hi.

07:09.123 --> 07:11.093
Donna, welcome.

07:11.445 --> 07:14.686
Here is your
bride-To-Be sash

07:15.531 --> 07:17.710
And a tiara.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.575
Can I get a sash?

07:22.207 --> 07:23.511
What do you do
with a sash?

07:24.321 --> 07:25.694
I don't care.
I want a sash.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.889
Welcome to the beginning
of a whole new life.

07:32.687 --> 07:33.427
Wow.

07:33.932 --> 07:36.572
This really is
a whole new life.

07:37.570 --> 07:39.519
Oh, did you get
some champagne, too?

07:39.542 --> 07:42.196
Oh, I can't.
I'm six months pregnant.

07:42.243 --> 07:44.659
Can't you tell?
I'm huge.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.297
She's perfect.

07:50.002 --> 07:54.592
Now, Eduardo, you'll have no say in any
of the decisions about your wedding,

07:54.627 --> 07:56.881
So go sit in
the groom's lounge.

07:58.161 --> 07:59.981
Oh, goody, new friends.

08:01.918 --> 08:02.658
- Hey!

08:03.328 --> 08:04.373
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:06.651 --> 08:07.813
"Hey"...

08:11.441 --> 08:12.968
Oh, perfect,

08:13.003 --> 08:14.468
Everyone's here.

08:16.347 --> 08:18.378
Well, look at
all of us just

08:18.531 --> 08:20.515
Packed right
in here, huh?

08:21.513 --> 08:23.680
Mom, dad,
you remember Angie.

08:24.114 --> 08:25.594
Of course
they remember me.

08:25.629 --> 08:27.789
I'm the only black girl
in town. Hello.

08:29.445 --> 08:31.054
Funny thing about Angie...

08:31.100 --> 08:32.486
She dates Kelso.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.256
- Ohh, honey.
- Tough break.

08:36.711 --> 08:40.679
So anyone have any stories
about Angie's new boyfriend

08:40.750 --> 08:42.441
And some of
his crazy antics?

08:42.583 --> 08:44.815
What do you want?
I got one with water,

08:44.851 --> 08:46.189
One with fire,

08:46.412 --> 08:48.808
One where he burned
himself underwater.

08:50.616 --> 08:51.461
Oh,

08:52.318 --> 08:54.466
Okay, I got a good one.

08:59.504 --> 09:01.641
Michael, what are you doing
with my blender?

09:02.399 --> 09:04.325
Don't worry.
It's not what you think.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.098
I'm making a
blender rocket.

09:10.536 --> 09:12.966
I couldn't have
daiquiris for a week.

09:15.134 --> 09:16.872
I've got a better one.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.332
Kelso, it's 6 in the morning.
Did someone glue you to the fridge?

09:23.248 --> 09:23.999
No.

09:25.572 --> 09:26.546
Kelso,

09:26.757 --> 09:28.894
Did you glue yourself
to the fridge?

09:31.419 --> 09:32.276
Yes.

09:42.933 --> 09:43.780
Thanks, man.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.510
Why does he glue
himself to stuff?

09:49.639 --> 09:51.812
Because he's
a big dum-Dum.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.186
Next?

09:54.503 --> 09:56.041
Okay, I got one.

10:00.773 --> 10:04.012
Donna, check it out.
I invented car skiing.

10:10.634 --> 10:12.171
Hit it, toots!

10:13.206 --> 10:15.027
You know, if there's anything
he should have glued himself to,

10:15.088 --> 10:17.546
It was probably
the top of that car.

10:18.347 --> 10:19.298
Steven

10:20.012 --> 10:21.456
Why are you
doing this?

10:22.349 --> 10:23.323
Doing what?

10:23.605 --> 10:24.744
Forman's doing it.

10:27.045 --> 10:28.853
Clearly you're in charge.

10:28.898 --> 10:32.960
Whoa. It's my pact. Why wouldn't
you think I'm in charge?

10:34.675 --> 10:38.445
Oh, it's probably because of
your narrow shoulders, honey.

10:39.865 --> 10:40.934
They just

10:41.228 --> 10:43.787
Don't shout "leader,"
you know?

10:48.675 --> 10:52.996
Oh, and Jim raises a lipstick.
Pretty confident, huh, Jim?

11:00.813 --> 11:02.809
That's right,
I am all in.

11:09.444 --> 11:11.346
Okay, read 'em
and weep.

11:11.557 --> 11:14.915
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

11:20.176 --> 11:21.941
All evens.

11:23.843 --> 11:26.097
Stacy, this is
so much fun.

11:26.097 --> 11:29.995
You know, I never thought I'd end up here.
Steven never wants to discuss marriage.

11:30.031 --> 11:30.991
Steven?

11:32.624 --> 11:35.148
My butler.
He is so uppity.

11:37.649 --> 11:39.246
Eduardo, where's my purse?

11:39.633 --> 11:40.741
I was mugged.

11:44.299 --> 11:47.775
Donna, come to my cousin's wedding
this weekend and check out her band.

11:47.798 --> 11:49.193
All right,
we'll be there.

11:49.216 --> 11:52.598
No, we won't, Donna.
It's insane.

11:55.451 --> 11:59.281
Excuse me. My fiancée told me
I have to give this back.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.706
Angie just broke
up with me.

12:14.847 --> 12:15.692
No.

12:17.266 --> 12:19.119
I don't know what happened.
She just dumped me,

12:19.154 --> 12:21.714
Like, out of nowhere, and I
was gonna take her car skiing.

12:24.943 --> 12:26.739
I need a hug
from your mother.

12:28.996 --> 12:34.326
Take off the training wheels, buddy, 'cause it
looks like somebody's ready for his big-Boy pact.

12:35.806 --> 12:37.565
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:37.588 --> 12:40.031
I have to go pull Kelso
off my mother.

12:47.869 --> 12:49.853
Jackie, we're not really going
to this wedding, are we?

12:49.877 --> 12:53.282
I have to, Fez. It feels
so good to be a fiancée.

12:55.348 --> 12:57.039
But you're
not a fiancée.

12:57.917 --> 13:01.839
You're a super cute high school girl that I've been
spying on through a window for three and a half years.

13:03.776 --> 13:05.127
Isn't that enough?

13:06.075 --> 13:06.768
Hey,

13:07.613 --> 13:08.459
What's up?

13:08.623 --> 13:09.433
Nothing.

13:14.658 --> 13:18.354
Usually when I ask that question, you don't
stop talking till I pretend to fall asleep.

13:19.645 --> 13:21.994
Ah, well, not today.

13:22.616 --> 13:23.743
You look guilty.

13:26.009 --> 13:27.975
What did you do?
Fez, what did she do?

13:29.185 --> 13:30.594
Oh, I wasn't listening.

13:31.474 --> 13:35.079
I was thinking about this prince
named Eduardo and his lunatic queen.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.390
Seriously, Steven,
everything's fine.

13:40.330 --> 13:41.093
All right,

13:41.398 --> 13:42.514
But I'm telling you,

13:42.713 --> 13:46.377
There's gonna be hell to pay if you've
donated all my clothes to the goodwill again.

13:51.765 --> 13:55.252
Now we're lying to Hyde?
This must stop, woman.

13:57.694 --> 14:01.290
Fez, I know it's a little crazy,
but what if this is all I get?

14:01.384 --> 14:03.873
I mean, what if Steven
never wants to settle down?

14:03.909 --> 14:07.807
What if I never get a real wedding
or real happiness or real anything?

14:08.077 --> 14:11.744
Or real happiness or real anything? What if
I'm just living in my pink bedroom alone forever?

14:17.709 --> 14:19.153
Fine, I'll go.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.895
But please remember,
you're never alone in there.

14:31.903 --> 14:35.461
I called Angie, like, 20 times,
and she won't even answer the phone.

14:35.989 --> 14:38.420
Wow. I guess something
really turned her off,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.420
Something incredibly

14:44.077 --> 14:45.134
Powerful.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.399
All right,

14:51.974 --> 14:55.591
So I've narrowed it down to two reasons
why Angie might have broken up with me.

14:55.814 --> 14:58.221
She's either a
lesbian or a robot.

15:00.910 --> 15:03.301
Come on, man, it's just a girl.
You'll get over it.

15:03.524 --> 15:05.144
Hey, do something for you.

15:06.025 --> 15:07.316
Take up smoking.

15:08.970 --> 15:12.034
I don't wanna get over it. I just want
Angie back. I'm going home.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.809
Wow. He really liked her.

15:19.115 --> 15:21.067
I feel like
I kicked a puppy.

15:22.488 --> 15:26.492
Well, this is what happens when you
get into a pact with Eric Forman.

15:27.543 --> 15:30.171
Complete and
utter devastation.

15:36.253 --> 15:36.758
What?

15:41.970 --> 15:44.447
So, Fez, what do you
think? You like my dress?

15:44.471 --> 15:47.077
Yeah, it's okay, but you know
what would be more appropriate?

15:47.252 --> 15:48.802
A straight
jacket...

15:50.611 --> 15:52.595
Because you're
a looney tune.

15:53.898 --> 15:55.680
- But, Fez...
- I said cuckoo!

15:59.414 --> 16:02.455
Donna, Eduardo, I want you
to meet my cousin Janie.

16:02.488 --> 16:03.674
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:03.721 --> 16:08.206
It is so nice to see two people declare
their love in such an expensive way.

16:09.604 --> 16:12.140
So, Janie, you
are looking good.

16:13.653 --> 16:15.203
What are you doing later?

16:15.238 --> 16:17.434
Um, going on
my honeymoon.

16:18.115 --> 16:19.559
You play hard-To-Get.

16:20.968 --> 16:22.518
I play hard-To-Get-Rid-Of.

16:26.486 --> 16:32.345
F.Y.I. for your wedding, Donna, tables one and
two, where we're sitting, are the popular tables.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.266
Tables five and up are your
friends you have to invite

16:35.301 --> 16:37.708
And relatives
who drive trucks.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.043
We are gonna get caught.

16:41.078 --> 16:44.744
No, we're not, Fez, okay? No one
knows us here. We'll be fine. Come on.

16:47.599 --> 16:51.497
I can't believe they
put us at table seven.

16:52.272 --> 16:55.113
I went to high school
with the bride's mother.

16:55.755 --> 16:56.765
That's it.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.371
I'm milking the
open bar as punishment.

17:00.745 --> 17:03.141
Well, hell, we could
have stayed home for that.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.583
Hey, Donna,

17:07.309 --> 17:09.246
I'm not wearing any
underwear under this.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.321
Does that, uh,

17:12.980 --> 17:14.282
Does that turn you on?

17:15.739 --> 17:16.585
No.

17:18.248 --> 17:20.808
- That only works when I do it.
- Ooh.

17:21.489 --> 17:23.873
Well, sucks to be the next
guy to rent this tux, huh?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.812
All right, Angie,
here's the deal.

17:35.540 --> 17:37.971
I did want everybody to tell
you those stories about Kelso,

17:38.018 --> 17:38.969
And that was wrong

17:39.458 --> 17:40.925
Because he
really likes you,

17:41.125 --> 17:42.781
So you have
to take him back.

17:43.379 --> 17:45.575
Steven this is
so unlike you.

17:47.818 --> 17:48.628
Well,

17:48.804 --> 17:51.528
A friend of mine sent me
a really big baggie from Hawaii...

17:55.532 --> 17:58.773
So I'm gonna be saying all sorts of
crazy stuff over the next couple weeks.

18:00.581 --> 18:04.021
Well, I didn't break up with
Michael because of the stories.

18:04.057 --> 18:07.180
I broke up with him because
I saw it was bothering you,

18:07.743 --> 18:09.317
And we have a
business to run.

18:10.738 --> 18:11.653
Look, just

18:12.087 --> 18:14.647
Do me a favor and
take him back.

18:15.997 --> 18:17.065
I'll think about it.

18:17.101 --> 18:18.768
Oh, man, Hyde,

18:19.284 --> 18:22.111
It is not easy doing
it on your desk.

18:25.963 --> 18:28.299
Okay, so I may have
already thought about it.

18:30.126 --> 18:31.758
He's so good-Looking.

18:35.343 --> 18:36.964
It's Stacy Wanamaker.

18:37.629 --> 18:39.989
Damn.
I do wanna make her...

18:41.419 --> 18:45.223
Uh, go to beauty
school 'cause she's ugly.

18:48.205 --> 18:50.915
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

18:51.983 --> 18:55.506
Um, yeah, hi.
I'm Donna Pinciotti.

18:55.553 --> 18:56.563
Donna.

18:57.338 --> 18:59.525
Donna, she says
she's Donna.

18:59.619 --> 19:00.969
Donna?
Donna?

19:00.993 --> 19:02.472
Donna?
Donna!

19:05.067 --> 19:06.077
Eduardo.

19:08.217 --> 19:10.025
No, she's Donna.

19:11.904 --> 19:13.548
Why would you lie?

19:14.064 --> 19:16.143
Are you even engaged?

19:21.864 --> 19:24.576
Can't believe a prince was
taken in by a common liar.

19:29.832 --> 19:30.560
Hey.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.568
Hey, how was the wedding?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.118
Well,

19:34.200 --> 19:37.594
The service was beautiful,
the flowers were gorgeous,

19:37.617 --> 19:40.165
And your girlfriend
was a humiliating wackadoo.

19:42.955 --> 19:44.129
Jackie was there?

19:45.890 --> 19:48.861
Are we still walking
from the car?

19:51.378 --> 19:54.090
This is taking forever.

20:00.032 --> 20:00.783
Hey.

20:01.098 --> 20:01.768
Hey,

20:02.461 --> 20:05.866
Thought you'd be on a plane back
to prince Eduardoland by now.

20:08.601 --> 20:11.185
Donna's mouth is
as big as her feet.

20:12.399 --> 20:14.618
Jackie, what the hell
were you thinking?

20:14.947 --> 20:18.164
Look, Steven, I know it's a
crazy thing to do. It's just

20:18.974 --> 20:22.790
I wanted to know what it was like to be
planning a life and a wedding and everything.

20:22.837 --> 20:24.732
I mean, that's all
I've ever wanted,

20:24.850 --> 20:27.269
And I was starting to think it
was never gonna happen with you.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.194
Are we back
on this again?

20:29.899 --> 20:32.306
Why can't you just be happy
with what we've got?

20:32.329 --> 20:34.370
Because I'm not, Steven!

20:35.004 --> 20:37.834
Look, I need to know that
we have a future together.

20:38.136 --> 20:43.261
Can't you just give me some kind of sign or just a tiny
glimmer of hope that maybe someday we'll get married?

20:43.315 --> 20:45.217
Jackie, I don't know.

20:46.292 --> 20:50.907
That's all you ever say! Please, Steven,
please, just say anything besides "I don't know,"

20:50.942 --> 20:52.339
Anything else!

20:54.822 --> 20:55.679
I don't know.

20:57.449 --> 20:59.504
Okay. Well, then I can't
be with you anymore.

20:59.656 --> 21:00.561
Jackie,

21:00.713 --> 21:02.956
Don't threaten me, okay?
It's not gonna work.

21:03.402 --> 21:04.846
I'm not threatening
you, Steven.

21:04.882 --> 21:08.414
I can't waste any more of my time
on you if it's not gonna happen for us.

21:12.794 --> 21:14.731
Okay, well, at
least now I know.

21:24.468 --> 21:25.560
Janie?

21:26.453 --> 21:27.627
Janie?

21:28.484 --> 21:30.210
Has anyone seen the bride?

21:30.233 --> 21:33.768
The limo's waiting and the
groom's gonna pass out any second

21:36.124 --> 21:37.287
Janie?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.353
Janie, what are you doing?

21:45.647 --> 21:48.378
What are you doing?
Have a little respect for the bride.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.157
Unless you wanna
join us, Yes? No?
