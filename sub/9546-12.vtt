00:09.658 --> 00:11.486
While looking
at the design right here.

00:11.486 --> 00:14.083
You said it would sleep six.

00:14.083 --> 00:15.646
A bunk bed?

00:15.646 --> 00:17.025
Are you mental?

00:17.671 --> 00:18.968
I'm not gonna sleep on a bunk bed.

00:18.968 --> 00:21.250
What is this? A luxury yacht
or a summer camp.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.329
It's 4:00, sir.
I have your Manhattan.

00:25.739 --> 00:27.088
Formica?

00:27.088 --> 00:32.512
I want mahogany from the stern
to the... to the other end.

00:32.829 --> 00:38.108
Well, I hope so. Because I swear to God,
if you don't, I will cancel this contract.

00:39.180 --> 00:41.324
He thinks I'm bluffing.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.361
Do you think bluffing?

00:44.857 --> 00:46.716
I wouldn't know, sir.

00:49.013 --> 00:51.166
You miss them, don't you?

00:51.166 --> 00:53.593
It was the worst day of my life, sir.

00:53.593 --> 00:56.066
I'm sure you feel the same way.

00:57.285 --> 00:58.880
Will that be all, sir?

01:00.630 --> 01:02.624
As a matter of fact, there's

01:02.624 --> 01:05.129
something I wanna talk to you about.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.030
I received another
one of your letters.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.850
Don't try to deny that it was you.

01:15.850 --> 01:17.921
Before I made the last drop,

01:17.921 --> 01:20.369
I marked the bills.

01:20.369 --> 01:23.911
Then I found them in your room.

01:23.911 --> 01:26.665
Since when is blackmail
on your list of duties?

01:26.665 --> 01:29.511
Master Paul, I don't know
what to say.

01:29.511 --> 01:31.297
I wasn't thinking straight.

01:31.297 --> 01:32.863
You weren't thinking straight?

01:32.863 --> 01:37.256
No, sir. The grief. Your father's death
and your step-mother.

01:37.256 --> 01:39.414
It won't happen again.

01:39.414 --> 01:41.297
Well, you got that right.

That'll be all.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2007/01/26

02:58.873 --> 03:02.279
All right. What...
what's this all about, Adrian?

03:02.279 --> 03:05.011
Come on.
Let's have it.

03:10.627 --> 03:13.664
Ah, police announce hiring freeze.

03:13.664 --> 03:17.950
A hiring freeze for the
next four years.

03:17.950 --> 03:21.961
By then I'll be too old to
be reinstated.So that's it.

03:21.961 --> 03:24.320
I'll never be a cop again.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.358
All right, Adrian, I am truly sorry.
I know how much reinstatement means to you.

03:28.358 --> 03:29.822
Only everything.

03:29.822 --> 03:33.433
It's my reason for living,
that's all.

03:34.529 --> 03:36.583
What do I do now?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.183
I think you go back to what
you've been doing. Consulting.

03:39.183 --> 03:40.245
For how long?

03:40.245 --> 03:45.058
I haven't had a new client in weeks.
The department hasn't renewed my contract.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.620
You know, Adrian, I think this is an
opportunity for you to make a decision,

03:49.620 --> 03:51.461
a very important decision.

03:51.461 --> 03:55.434
Now, you can let this news
completely depress you...

03:55.434 --> 03:57.787
Okay.
Thank you.

03:57.787 --> 04:03.045
Or... you can look at this
like an opportunity.

04:03.045 --> 04:06.006
A chance for you to reassess
your life, start over,

04:06.006 --> 04:09.695
do something completely different.

04:10.088 --> 04:11.498
Different.

04:11.498 --> 04:13.099
Yeah.

04:13.099 --> 04:15.696
Different can be good.

04:15.696 --> 04:18.334
Different... good?

04:20.397 --> 04:21.940
Different... good.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.883
Adrian, it's not too late.

04:23.883 --> 04:28.375
You know, Winston Churchill did not
become Prime Minister until he was 60.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.211
What are you talking about?

04:30.211 --> 04:33.139
- I'll never become Prime Minister.
- No, no, I'm not saying that...

04:33.139 --> 04:36.193
I don't even live in England.
Even if I did, I...

04:36.193 --> 04:39.086
- I'd be such a long shot.
- Adrian.

04:39.086 --> 04:40.700
It's just an example.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.487
What do I do now?

04:47.108 --> 04:52.066
And right then, I promised myself
I would never fly commercial again.

04:52.066 --> 04:54.961
- Thank you.
- Mom, it's not even 12:00.

04:59.146 --> 05:00.205
It's 12:05.

05:00.205 --> 05:02.539
Bobby, can i ask you something?

05:02.539 --> 05:04.158
Do you love your job?

05:04.158 --> 05:05.443
Yes, I do.

05:05.443 --> 05:08.752
- What do you do exactly?
- He inherits money.

05:08.752 --> 05:11.537
I could do that.
I bet I'd be good at that.

05:11.537 --> 05:14.774
There's a hiring freeze at the department,
but we're working through it, right?

05:14.774 --> 05:16.311
We'll figure something out.
There's always hope.

05:16.311 --> 05:18.008
- There's never hope.
- Sue, there is.

05:18.008 --> 05:20.925
There's never hope.
I wish I drank.

05:20.925 --> 05:22.371
Is it wonderful?

05:22.371 --> 05:24.875
Yeah, it's pretty great.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.323
Oh, you know who asked about you?

05:27.323 --> 05:28.610
Paul Buchanan.

05:29.315 --> 05:30.152
No, thank you.

05:30.152 --> 05:32.454
Sweetheart, I really don't think
you can be so picky.

05:32.454 --> 05:34.603
You aren't getting any younger, you know.

05:34.603 --> 05:35.598
Who's Paul Buchanan?

05:35.598 --> 05:37.852
He lives in the big house up the road.

05:37.852 --> 05:40.054
The big house?
This isn't the big house?

05:40.054 --> 05:43.026
He's always had a think for Natalie.

05:43.026 --> 05:44.911
He's proposed to her twice.

05:44.911 --> 05:49.026
He's a creep. He's a spoiled, arrogant,
creepy creep who's just... He's very creepy.

05:49.026 --> 05:51.212
Now, now.
He's a good man.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.585
You know, that poor boy.

05:53.585 --> 05:57.158
He's been through so much.
You heard what happened with his parents.

05:57.158 --> 06:00.851
It's the most incredible story.
They died within ten minutes of each other.

06:00.851 --> 06:04.858
- Within ten minutes?
- Yeah, it was about a year ago.

06:04.858 --> 06:07.136
Ralph and Camilla, that's
Paul's stepmother,

06:07.136 --> 06:10.067
were driving home,
and they were in his little sports car.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.827
That one he brought over from England.

06:11.827 --> 06:15.361
It was a Morgan, a beautiful machine.
Ralph collected antique cars.

06:15.361 --> 06:17.693
Yeah, well, anyway,
they never made it home.

06:17.693 --> 06:22.837
It was about 8:30 at night. And they were
coming around that dangerous curve

06:22.837 --> 06:25.832
at the end of Sweeney Road.
The one with the big rock.

06:25.832 --> 06:28.809
I... I think we passed it when
we were coming up.

06:28.809 --> 06:32.210
Isn't there a sign that says slow down?

06:32.210 --> 06:36.252
Obviously Ralph ignored that because the
police said he had to be doing at least 80.

06:36.252 --> 06:40.645
Let's say that this is the car.
All right?

06:40.645 --> 06:43.263
Now, this is a Ralph, and
this is Camilla.

06:43.263 --> 06:48.328
Now, they come speeding
around that curve.

06:48.328 --> 06:49.460
They hit the guard rail.

06:49.460 --> 06:54.415
And Camilla wasn't wearing
a seat belt, goes flying and boom.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.056
Hits her head on the big rock.

06:56.056 --> 06:58.722
Honey, don't use the pate.

06:58.722 --> 07:02.240
That is not pate, darling.
That is the big rock.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.744
And then Ralph calls 911 on his cell.

07:04.744 --> 07:08.510
Oh, it gets worse. He had
a heart attack right there on the phone.

07:08.510 --> 07:10.998
While he's calling for help.

07:11.634 --> 07:15.678
So the road curves to the right.
And she was thrown from the car?

07:15.678 --> 07:18.080
Yeah, right this.

07:21.298 --> 07:28.643
But if it was a Morgan,
a British car, then...

07:31.048 --> 07:34.569
then she would have been sitting
on the left.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.345
How did she hit the rock?

07:50.490 --> 07:53.704
You know what else?
I remember driving with Mr. Buchanan.

07:53.704 --> 07:57.233
He was the pokiest driver in the world.
We used to tease him about it.

07:57.233 --> 08:00.289
He would not start the car
unless you fastened your seatbelts.

08:00.289 --> 08:02.353
- You wanna check it out?
- Ah, it's probably nothing.

08:02.353 --> 08:06.765
No, let's check it out. / Natalie, it
doesn't matter. I'm not a detective anymore.

08:06.765 --> 08:09.567
Daddy, give me your wallet./ Uh-oh.

08:09.567 --> 08:12.063
- Brings back memories, doesn't it?
- Yes.

08:12.063 --> 08:13.946
Okay.
Here you go.

08:13.946 --> 08:17.071
I am hiring you.
We are checking it out.

08:27.114 --> 08:31.209
Well, this section of the guard rail is new.

08:31.209 --> 08:33.063
It must have happened right here.

08:33.063 --> 08:36.730
Car was heading west.
It went off the road here.

08:36.730 --> 08:38.820
So you were right.
She couldn't have hit that rock.

08:38.820 --> 08:41.166
It's hard to tell without seeing
the police report.

08:41.166 --> 08:45.883
Maybe the car flipped over.
Maybe it spun around.

08:45.883 --> 08:48.394
No, I think he did it.
I think he killed his parents.

08:48.394 --> 08:51.755
You really don't like this guy, do you?
What did he ever do to you?

08:51.755 --> 08:53.779
You really wanna know? / No.

08:55.813 --> 08:57.540
What is that noise?

08:58.169 --> 08:59.479
Oh, frogs.

08:59.479 --> 09:03.834
They live in that pond over there.
It's mating season. They go crazy every year.

09:04.855 --> 09:09.356
Frogs... Frog, frog, frog, frog,
frog, frog, frog, frog, frog.

09:09.356 --> 09:13.240
Are you afraid of frogs? / I don't know.
I've never been this close to one.

09:14.981 --> 09:17.907
Yes.
The answer is yes.

09:17.907 --> 09:19.895
Put the frogs on the list.
Where's the list?

09:19.895 --> 09:21.556
Okay, kay, kay, kay.

09:21.556 --> 09:22.844
I got it. I got it. I got it.

09:22.844 --> 09:26.035
- Where does it go?
- Put them between...

09:26.035 --> 09:30.165
possums and, uh... soccer riots.

09:30.165 --> 09:31.512
No, no, no.

09:31.512 --> 09:37.587
Uh, after... after soccer riots.
And before, uh, before...

09:37.587 --> 09:39.380
before hailstones.
Yeah, so it goes...

09:39.380 --> 09:43.165
I got it, I got it...
Soccer riots, frogs, hailstones.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.681
At least now we know.

09:45.681 --> 09:47.192
Information really is power.

09:47.192 --> 09:50.251
I'm gonna call my parents and
tell them we're gonna be late.

09:52.886 --> 09:55.265
Wait, there's no signal.
There's no service at all.

09:55.265 --> 09:56.446
Are you sure?

09:56.446 --> 09:59.905
How could Ralph Buchanan have
called for help?

09:59.905 --> 10:01.359
He couldn't.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.939
He didn't.

10:18.895 --> 10:20.479
Wow.

10:20.479 --> 10:24.764
I know.I know.
Wow, 14 bedrooms.

10:25.371 --> 10:27.337
And he wanted to marry you.

10:27.337 --> 10:29.257
Hey, let me just tell you about
Paul Buchanan.

10:29.257 --> 10:31.398
He basically stalked me
for three years.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.623
All during high school he just
kept on asking me out.

10:34.623 --> 10:36.452
He wouldn't take "drop dead"
for an answer.

10:36.452 --> 10:40.241
The week before my senior prom,
somebody mugged my boyfriend.

10:40.241 --> 10:43.490
They broke his jaw and
both his legs.

10:44.996 --> 10:46.755
14 bedrooms.

10:46.755 --> 10:50.660
Mr. Monk. He beat up my boyfriend
or hired some thug to do it.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.577
He thinks he can get away
with anything.

10:52.577 --> 10:55.948
- Like killing his father?
- I wouldn't put it past him.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.876
All right, so the garage is back there.
The Morgan is inside.

10:58.876 --> 11:01.077
He hasn't even bothered to fix it.

11:01.077 --> 11:06.629
- How do you know?
- My father saw it the last time he was here.

11:06.629 --> 11:11.416
Okay. Okay.
Let's take a look.

11:11.416 --> 11:13.784
I can't go in.
I'll meet you back here in ten minutes.

11:13.784 --> 11:16.639
What are you talking about?
I'm not going in there alone.

11:16.639 --> 11:21.809
That would be like me...
going in some place alone.

11:21.809 --> 11:24.762
Mr. Monk, if he sees you,
you can talk your way out of it.

11:24.762 --> 11:28.008
If he sees me, it'd be horrible.
It'd be like high school all over again.

11:28.008 --> 11:31.145
I can't.
Here, in case you need it.

11:32.998 --> 11:36.526
Natalie, I really think
you're overreacting here.

11:36.526 --> 11:42.014
this was 20 years ago.
People get older. They mature...

12:21.261 --> 12:23.918
Can I help you?
What the hell are you doing?

12:23.918 --> 12:25.270
Sorry.
I, uh...

12:25.270 --> 12:28.296
Are you here for the job interview?

12:28.296 --> 12:31.473
Yes, the interview.
Exactly.

12:31.473 --> 12:34.962
Follow me.
He's been waiting for you.

13:01.685 --> 13:03.698
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:03.698 --> 13:06.437
This is in case the interview
doesn't go well.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.196
Just joking.

13:08.196 --> 13:10.786
I was doing a little hunting.

13:10.786 --> 13:12.852
All right, so you're here
from the agency.

13:12.852 --> 13:16.656
- Where's your resume?
- I lost it.

13:16.656 --> 13:19.249
You lost your resume.
Well.

13:19.249 --> 13:21.440
- It doesn't bode well, does it?
- No.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.889
- What's your name?
- Adrian.

13:25.225 --> 13:26.937
Adrian?

13:30.397 --> 13:32.879
Melville.
Adrian Melville.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.953
Huh.

13:34.953 --> 13:35.968
What's with this place?

13:35.968 --> 13:39.191
I had friends over last night.
The room was a mess.

13:39.191 --> 13:42.417
While I was waiting, I sort of
tidied up.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.979
Well, I'm impressed.
Very well done, Adrian Melville.

13:44.979 --> 13:46.204
Thank you.

13:46.204 --> 13:48.357
- Did you do this?
- Yeah, sorry.

13:48.357 --> 13:50.275
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

13:50.275 --> 13:52.934
In 20 minutes. I've been working
on this puzzle for a month.

13:52.934 --> 13:56.075
Sorry, I'll mess it up again.
I think I remember exactly how to...

13:56.075 --> 14:01.217
No, no, no, no. I got a couple of step sisters
who think I never finish anything.

14:01.217 --> 14:02.289
Huh.

14:02.289 --> 14:03.586
Well, come on.
Sit down.

14:03.586 --> 14:06.226
Tell me, Melville, who have
you worked for? Anybody I know?

14:06.226 --> 14:08.270
I don't think so...

14:08.270 --> 14:13.786
Leland Stottlemeyer, of the
San Francisco Stottlemeyers.

14:13.786 --> 14:17.556
Randy Disher.
Dr. Charles Cook.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.243
No, I don't know them.

14:19.243 --> 14:21.136
And Natalie Teeger.

14:21.136 --> 14:22.862
Natalie?
Really?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.055
She grew up right down the street.

14:25.055 --> 14:27.745
I went to school with her
when she was still Natalie Davenport.

14:27.745 --> 14:30.313
She had a big crush on me,
wouldn't leave me alone.

14:30.313 --> 14:31.537
Is that right?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.649
How does she look?

14:32.649 --> 14:36.076
- Does she still have that tattoo?
- She has a tattoo?

14:36.076 --> 14:39.202
I guess you wouldn't have seen it.
Not where she put it.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.761
Look, I'm having a big
luncheon on Sunday.

14:43.761 --> 14:46.279
A bunch of the old fossils
from the family foundation.

14:46.279 --> 14:48.838
You think Natalie'd show up?
Make the afternoon a lot better.

14:48.838 --> 14:52.405
I don't think...

14:52.405 --> 14:53.498
Maybe.

14:53.498 --> 14:57.452
Well, Adrian Melville, I go with my gut.
My gut likes what it sees.

14:57.452 --> 14:59.383
If Natalie Teeger recommends you,
that's good enough for me.

14:59.383 --> 15:01.783
Congratulations, you're my new butler.

15:01.783 --> 15:04.165
- I'm your butler?
- Yeah, come on.

15:04.165 --> 15:07.056
I'll show you around.
Your room's upstairs. Grab that drink.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.956
Natalie, it's for you.

15:20.956 --> 15:23.127
Oh, thank you.

15:23.127 --> 15:24.615
Hello?

15:24.615 --> 15:26.366
Oh, Mr. Monk, thank God.

15:26.366 --> 15:28.413
I'm gonna need you to come
and get me now.

15:28.413 --> 15:30.647
Well, what happened?
Where are you?

15:30.647 --> 15:32.017
I'm in my bedroom.

15:32.017 --> 15:34.539
I work here now.
I'm the butler.

15:34.539 --> 15:38.603
- You're the butler?
- Yes, your old boyfriend just hired me.

15:38.603 --> 15:41.670
- I'm the new manservant.
- I think that's great.

15:41.670 --> 15:42.955
Do you?

15:42.955 --> 15:45.698
Do you really?
Do you think it's great?

15:45.698 --> 15:46.904
Yeah, you'll be able to look around.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.539
You're right there.
You're in the belly of the beast.

15:49.539 --> 15:51.746
Natalie, it's not a good thing.
It's a bad thing.

15:51.746 --> 15:54.552
Okay, it's a belly, and it's a beast.

15:54.552 --> 15:55.703
Now come and get me.

15:55.703 --> 15:57.686
How about this?
I pick you up tomorrow morning.

15:57.686 --> 15:58.846
Tomorrow morning?

15:58.846 --> 16:01.590
Yes, maybe by then we'll have
something to show the captain.

16:01.590 --> 16:08.687
Okay, yeah, that's one scenario.
May I suggest an alternate scenario?

16:08.687 --> 16:11.644
Pick me up!

16:11.644 --> 16:14.343
There's somebody he... somebody here.
I'll call you later.

16:14.343 --> 16:16.741
Wait, wait... wa... wa... wait.

16:17.525 --> 16:19.771
Come in.

16:20.890 --> 16:23.503
- Mr. Melville?
- Yeah, Melville.

16:23.503 --> 16:28.046
Hi. I'm Suzy, the housekeeper.
Assistant housekeeper, actually.

16:28.046 --> 16:31.603
And Mrs. Murphy wanted me to
see if you needed anything.

16:31.603 --> 16:32.985
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:32.985 --> 16:36.669
I'm supposed to pick up your uniform,
and I need to know your size.

16:36.669 --> 16:41.487
Oh, thank you, Suzy,
but that won't be, uh...

16:41.487 --> 16:43.857
I'm a 42 regular.

16:43.857 --> 16:46.729
I'm sorry about all the mess.
This was Stilson's room.

16:46.729 --> 16:49.767
And he subscribed to, like,
50 magazines.

16:49.767 --> 16:55.027
- Who's Stilson?
- Your predecessor. Edward Stilson.

16:55.027 --> 16:58.296
He was with the family forever.
I just can't believe he left like that.

16:58.296 --> 16:59.861
What do you mean?

16:59.861 --> 17:05.686
Well, Mr. Buchanan said that they had
a really big fight about back pay or something.

17:05.686 --> 17:07.617
Stilson just stormed out of the house.

17:07.617 --> 17:10.236
- When was this?
- Last week.

17:10.236 --> 17:15.165
And he left his suitcase
and all of his pictures.

17:15.165 --> 17:18.500
Well, he'll probably send for them
when he cools off.

17:18.500 --> 17:23.444
Um, I know you haven't even unpacked yet,
but we need you to approve this.

17:23.444 --> 17:26.251
It's the seating chart
for the luncheon on Sunday.

17:26.251 --> 17:29.473
I'm sure it's fine.
Just do whatever you want.

17:29.473 --> 17:33.132
Very well, sir.
I'm right down the hall if you need me.

17:33.738 --> 17:37.778
Excuse me, could I... uh,
could I see that again?

17:41.155 --> 17:43.760
- There'll be 11 at the table?
- Yes, sir.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.797
So do you just wanna put five
on one side and then six on the other?

17:47.797 --> 17:52.896
No, no, no. That wouldn't be even.
It has to be even.

17:52.896 --> 17:57.162
How long is the table?

17:57.162 --> 17:58.107
Um, I'm not sure.

17:58.107 --> 18:00.436
Suzy. Suzy.

18:00.436 --> 18:04.179
I don't know what I'm going to
do with you.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.852
This fork is a centimeter too close.

18:48.852 --> 18:51.458
It's only a centimeter.

18:52.058 --> 18:57.169
For the want of a nail, Mrs. Murphy,
the kingdom was lost.

19:00.551 --> 19:05.162
One centimeter off on this side.
One centimeter off on that side.

19:05.162 --> 19:07.331
Before you know it what have you got?

19:08.326 --> 19:10.257
Two centimeters.

19:12.706 --> 19:18.127
- Uh-oh, who folded this napkin?
- I did, sir.

19:19.379 --> 19:22.915
And you call this a beveled half-Bedford?

19:22.915 --> 19:29.954
Mr. Melville, it's 2:30 in the morning.
We've been here all night.

19:29.954 --> 19:33.083
Luncheon isn't until
Sunday afternoon, sir.

19:33.083 --> 19:36.785
Almost done, Mrs. Murphy.

19:36.785 --> 19:39.334
Almost finished.

19:46.634 --> 19:52.389
- How tall is Mr. Fairchild?
- About my height, sir.

19:52.389 --> 19:56.666
Then he belongs over here
across from Miss Monica.

19:56.666 --> 19:59.436
Symmetry.
Sweet symmetry.

19:59.436 --> 20:01.077
That's fine, sir.
Except...

20:01.077 --> 20:02.427
Except?

20:02.427 --> 20:05.931
You can't put Mr. B
next to his stepsisters.

20:05.931 --> 20:07.511
They hate each other.

20:07.511 --> 20:10.789
There was an accident
about a year ago. A car crash.

20:10.789 --> 20:14.453
Their mother died a few moments
before Mr. Buchanan's father.

20:14.453 --> 20:17.667
Mmm, yes, I heard that story.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.828
Apparently when it came time
to divide the estate,

20:20.828 --> 20:26.620
Monica and Clara didn't feel they were
treated as fairly as they might have been.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.395
I see.
How much did they get?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.279
Nothing.

20:32.279 --> 20:34.997
- And they wanted more?
- Yes, sir.

20:34.997 --> 20:37.262
Apparently they did.

20:42.451 --> 20:44.621
911, what is your emergency?

20:44.621 --> 20:47.175
- My wife. She's dead.
- Where are you?

20:47.175 --> 20:50.892
On Sweeney Road.
Right near Spider Lake.

20:50.892 --> 20:53.768
I'm feeling her pulse.
She's definitely dead.

20:53.768 --> 20:55.765
She's not breathing.
Her neck is broken.

20:55.765 --> 21:00.784
I don't think I... uh... Oh, God!
I can't breathe. Uh...

21:00.784 --> 21:04.635
- Sir?
- Uh... my heart!

21:04.635 --> 21:06.293
- What does that prove?
- Are you kidding?

21:06.293 --> 21:07.900
It proves everything.
There's nothing to discuss.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.622
Captain, we were there yesterday.

21:09.622 --> 21:12.082
There's no reception.
He couldn't have made that call.

21:12.082 --> 21:14.805
That happens all the time, Natalie,
for a million different reasons...

21:14.805 --> 21:18.535
different cell phones, terrain.
Read the coroner's report.

21:18.535 --> 21:23.622
April 9th, one year ago, Camilla Buchanan
died in the accident upon impact.

21:23.622 --> 21:26.203
Ralph Buchanan died of a heart attack.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.123
He did it.
I know he did it.

21:28.123 --> 21:31.608
Why? Because he made you
cry in homeroom?

21:31.608 --> 21:33.816
Because I know him
and guys like him.

21:33.816 --> 21:36.417
They think they own the world,
and you know what? Because they do.

21:36.417 --> 21:38.157
Monk, what do you think?

21:38.157 --> 21:40.896
Look, Natalie, you heard the tape.
It was an accident.

21:40.896 --> 21:43.180
She hit her head.
He had a heart attack.

21:43.180 --> 21:46.120
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.812
Wa... wait.
Why are you going back to work?

21:47.812 --> 21:49.244
- What work?
- He's a butler.

21:49.244 --> 21:50.845
We prefer to be called house managers.

21:50.845 --> 21:52.794
He's working for Paul Buchanan undercover.

21:52.794 --> 21:56.825
I was undercover. Now I'm thinking
about making it official.

21:56.825 --> 21:58.691
- As a butler?
- A house manager.

21:58.691 --> 22:01.093
They prefer house manager.

22:01.093 --> 22:03.029
- Why?
- I'm good at it.

22:03.029 --> 22:06.046
No, you're good at this.
You're good at being a cop.

22:06.046 --> 22:08.083
Really? The department
doesn't seem to think so.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.815
Oh, I get it. Those sons of bitches
and the hiring freeze.

22:10.815 --> 22:15.518
Look, Monk, I told you I am working on that,
okay? Just give me a little more time.

22:15.518 --> 22:19.918
It's too late, Captain. I've moved on.
It's a new dawn.

22:19.918 --> 22:23.512
What about Natalie? / I'm hoping that
Natalie will remain in my employ.

22:23.512 --> 22:25.585
There is a position opening up
in the kitchen.

22:25.585 --> 22:28.613
Speaking of kitchens,
I really must get back.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.412
I have a duck in the oven
that's not going to braise itself.

22:31.412 --> 22:34.612
And the master is very particular
about that sort of thing.

22:40.262 --> 22:41.901
The master?

22:55.443 --> 22:56.643
Wow.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.119
Very good.

23:01.775 --> 23:03.033
Excellent.

23:03.474 --> 23:05.312
Thank you, Mr. Melville.

23:05.312 --> 23:08.809
Well, I don't have to remind you people
how important these stupid luncheons are.

23:08.809 --> 23:11.607
The old bats are gunning for me.
They want me to screw up.

23:11.607 --> 23:16.075
They expect me to screw up.
I intend to disappoint them.

23:16.075 --> 23:18.271
- Mr. Melville.
- Thank you, sir.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.508
Mr. Puckldge.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.862
I've divided the house into four zones.

23:24.862 --> 23:29.875
Mr. Stilson usually just has us
start in the kitchen.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.612
Mr. Stilson is no longer with us.

23:32.612 --> 23:37.094
So from now on, we're going
to be cleaning the house my way.

23:37.094 --> 23:38.965
The Monk way.

23:38.965 --> 23:40.529
Who's Monk?

23:48.618 --> 23:50.484
You see...

23:51.003 --> 23:53.047
I grew up in a monastery.

23:53.047 --> 23:56.015
And the monks were very demanding.

23:56.015 --> 24:01.720
We were cleaning constantly.
18 hours a day.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.692
Mostly dusting.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.647
It was very dusty.

24:05.647 --> 24:09.036
Crypts, catacombs.

24:09.036 --> 24:11.968
It was holy dust.

24:11.968 --> 24:14.769
But still...

24:14.769 --> 24:17.252
You know, dust.

24:19.497 --> 24:22.623
That is the Monk way.

24:22.623 --> 24:27.215
Well, you heard the man.
We'll be doing it the Monk way.

24:30.839 --> 24:32.615
Zone one...

24:38.118 --> 24:39.788
The Swiffer please.

25:10.512 --> 25:13.764
A flaw in the crystal.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.212
- I don't see it.
- I do.

25:37.038 --> 25:38.651
No.

26:18.403 --> 26:21.979
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes. I'm fine.

26:21.979 --> 26:24.694
There's just so much to do.

26:24.694 --> 26:27.320
He does one of these every month?

26:27.320 --> 26:28.845
Yes, sir.

26:31.788 --> 26:33.362
Is that blood?

26:35.282 --> 26:37.565
I'll take care of it, sir.

26:37.565 --> 26:39.933
See that you do.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.259
Almost done.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.534
There you go.

26:55.534 --> 26:57.017
Thank you, Melville.

26:57.017 --> 27:00.035
Your attention to detail is
almost pathological.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.853
Thank you, sir.
It's almost noon.

27:02.853 --> 27:04.540
I think we should be getting downstairs.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.299
I'm sorry.
Still not quite...

27:08.299 --> 27:11.480
- Thank you, Melville.
- My pleasure, sir.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.103
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

27:14.103 --> 27:15.085
There you go.

27:15.085 --> 27:16.944
Now, your guests should be
arriving any second...

27:16.944 --> 27:18.835
I'm sorry.
It's still slightly...

27:18.835 --> 27:20.786
You know what?
It's fine. It's close enough.

27:20.786 --> 27:22.513
One second.
Almost have it.

27:22.513 --> 27:24.596
- I said it's fine.
- I just have to center it.

27:24.596 --> 27:26.579
You know what?
I'm just gonna lose the tie.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.770
And go with something
a little more casual.

27:28.770 --> 27:31.372
Yes, sir.
Good choice.

27:31.372 --> 27:34.804
- Speaking of Natalie.
- Were we speaking of Natalie?

27:34.804 --> 27:37.205
Well, we are now. / Ah.

27:37.205 --> 27:42.143
- She didn't RSVP, did she?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

27:43.694 --> 27:48.446
It is better to have loved and lost,
then never to have loved at all.

27:48.446 --> 27:50.312
Do you believe that, Melville?

27:51.272 --> 27:55.473
I don't know, sir.
It's a tough call.

28:27.654 --> 28:30.724
Paul, this mushroom bisque is
just heavenly.

28:30.724 --> 28:34.152
Well, it's Camilla's recipe.
I thought it was appropriate since...

28:34.152 --> 28:36.003
the foundation was her idea.

28:36.003 --> 28:38.185
Mr. Melville, I'll have some more soup.
My diet be damned.

28:38.185 --> 28:39.379
Very good, sir.

28:39.379 --> 28:44.148
Paulie, I have to say, when you're
sitting in that chair in that suit,

28:44.148 --> 28:46.705
you look just like your father.

28:46.705 --> 28:48.762
You sound like him too.

28:48.762 --> 28:50.985
He's a crook.

28:50.985 --> 28:52.341
Monica, did you say something?

28:52.341 --> 28:56.291
I said you can't judge a crook
by his cover.

28:57.348 --> 29:00.934
Sir, there's a phone call for you.
A Miss Teeger.

29:00.934 --> 29:03.409
- Who?
- Natalie Teeger.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.194
I'll call her back.

29:06.194 --> 29:08.251
She said that it's very important.

29:08.251 --> 29:12.307
It can't be more important
than this, can it?

29:16.364 --> 29:18.250
He said what?

29:19.762 --> 29:21.188
Oh!

29:34.600 --> 29:36.988
It's only the second course,
and I can barely move.

29:36.988 --> 29:40.722
As long as you can still sign those checks,
Alfred, that's all that matters.

29:40.722 --> 29:43.216
Paul, I'm so glad you decide to
keep the house.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.371
We were afraid you might sell it.

29:44.371 --> 29:47.196
Oh, absolutely not.
I will never sell this place.

29:47.196 --> 29:50.469
This is the homestead, Roger.
This is where Clara, Monica, and I grew up.

29:50.469 --> 29:51.868
Until you kicked us out.

29:51.868 --> 29:53.579
Monica.
Not now.

29:53.579 --> 29:57.005
Why not now?
We may never be invited back.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.938
You know what I can't get past?

29:58.938 --> 30:02.173
Our mother died ten minutes
before his father.

30:02.173 --> 30:05.198
If Ralph had died first, we would
have inherited everything.

30:05.198 --> 30:06.402
Ten minutes.

30:06.402 --> 30:08.722
600 seconds.

30:08.722 --> 30:10.479
Are you accusing me of
something, Monica?

30:10.479 --> 30:16.072
All I'm saying is, you're either
very lucky... or very smart.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.825
And I'm very drunk.

30:19.868 --> 30:23.669
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have another guest.

30:24.384 --> 30:25.700
Natalie!

30:25.700 --> 30:28.631
Is there room for one more?
I changed my mind and decided to come.

30:28.631 --> 30:31.140
Well, of course there is.
Mr. Melville!

30:32.054 --> 30:33.238
You remember Mr. Melville,
don't you?

30:33.238 --> 30:34.756
Yes, of course.

30:34.756 --> 30:37.995
Miss Teeger. / I should never
have let Mr. Melville go.

30:37.995 --> 30:40.243
Miss Teeger will be joining us.
We'll need another place setting.

30:40.243 --> 30:43.947
I don't think there's room, sir.
It's all been planned out to the centimeter.

30:43.947 --> 30:45.494
It took me all night.

30:45.494 --> 30:47.256
Melville, I'm not gonna ask you again.

30:47.256 --> 30:49.027
Thank you, sir.

30:49.027 --> 30:53.815
Put Miss Teeger at the table.
Put her next to me. And do it now.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.602
As you wish.

30:59.788 --> 31:04.520
Everyone, this is Natalie Davenport,
an old friend of mine from high school.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.502
At least I hope she still consider
me a friend.

31:07.502 --> 31:10.387
You look fantastic.

31:10.387 --> 31:12.904
Really. I mean, you haven't
changed a bit since high school.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.092
Oh, wow.

31:15.092 --> 31:18.644
I wouldn't say that.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.527
Look at that.

31:20.527 --> 31:22.705
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

31:22.705 --> 31:25.056
My boyfriend couldn't make it.

31:25.056 --> 31:28.005
He had to go to anger
management class.

31:29.192 --> 31:30.676
Again.

31:32.105 --> 31:34.097
Well, I better get back to the...

31:34.097 --> 31:38.109
I'm glad you could come.

31:38.109 --> 31:41.241
Mr. Melville.
Will you help me with my coat?

31:47.460 --> 31:48.949
How did you do that?

31:48.949 --> 31:52.515
See, Mr. Monk, when two people love
each other, they wanna express that love.

31:52.515 --> 31:54.385
- What?
- It's a pillow!

31:54.385 --> 31:57.112
Ah, well, that explains almost nothing.

31:57.112 --> 31:59.802
I had to come. I realized something
about the frogs. / What frogs?

31:59.802 --> 32:02.825
Okay, on that 911 call there were
no frogs in the background.

32:02.825 --> 32:04.988
You were there.
Remember how loud they were?

32:04.988 --> 32:07.067
That call was definitely made
from someplace else.

32:07.067 --> 32:09.478
Not necessarily.
Maybe they just weren't croaking.

32:09.478 --> 32:11.425
- Maybe they were tired.
- Frogs don't get tired.

32:11.425 --> 32:13.197
- You don't think frogs get tired?
- No, I don't.

32:13.197 --> 32:14.696
Believe me.
Frogs get tired.

32:14.696 --> 32:16.844
The hopping and the thing with the tongue.

32:16.844 --> 32:19.431
You try hopping around and catching flies.
You wouldn't last ten minutes.

32:19.431 --> 32:21.522
This man is a creep.
Why are you protecting him?

32:21.522 --> 32:24.471
I'm not protecting anyone.
There is no evidence here.

32:24.471 --> 32:26.648
Then find some.
You're a detective.

32:26.648 --> 32:28.303
You were supposed to go check
out the car in the garage.

32:28.303 --> 32:29.295
Have you been to the garage?

32:29.295 --> 32:30.614
No, something came up.

32:30.614 --> 32:32.028
- What?
- This.

32:32.028 --> 32:34.884
My life. My new career.
I love it here.

32:34.884 --> 32:36.449
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

32:36.449 --> 32:38.573
No, you don't.
I can tell. You look terrible.

32:38.573 --> 32:40.544
Well, fortunately, this job is
not about my looks.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.558
Have you been sleeping at all?

32:42.558 --> 32:46.948
Mr. Melville!
Shall we begin the main course, sir?

32:46.948 --> 32:50.400
Yes, thank you, Mrs. Murphy.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.217
Should you be drinking that?

33:08.410 --> 33:10.957
I'll have some quail, please.

33:10.957 --> 33:13.990
He took the quail.
We're alternating.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.424
I'd prefer the quail.

33:16.424 --> 33:20.990
It's just we've been going
quail, duck, quail, duck, quail, duck...

33:20.990 --> 33:23.273
I don't like duck.

33:23.273 --> 33:25.095
Then you'll have to sit over there.

33:25.095 --> 33:28.786
I have to change seats? / Fine.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.987
Here.

33:32.987 --> 33:39.172
Two quails... right next to each other.

33:39.172 --> 33:41.132
Enjoy.

33:41.132 --> 33:43.353
By the way... you're all invited to stay.

33:43.353 --> 33:48.327
Alfred and I are gonna do some
quail hunting later with a few of the neighbors.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.787
Where's Natalie?

33:49.787 --> 33:52.438
She said she had to freshen up, sir.

33:52.438 --> 33:53.939
Really?

34:16.722 --> 34:21.326
April 9th.
The night they died.

34:21.326 --> 34:26.670
8:30.
God, so he was here.

34:26.670 --> 34:29.838
There you are.
I was getting worried.

34:29.838 --> 34:32.556
Oh, I was just feeling nauseous.

34:32.556 --> 34:34.152
So you came to the garage?

34:34.152 --> 34:37.181
Yeah, I didn't wanna bother anybody.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.286
I'm glad you did.

34:41.286 --> 34:44.106
I wanted to talk to you.

34:44.106 --> 34:46.389
Sometimes I think about adopting a kid.

34:46.389 --> 34:50.255
Someone to share all this with.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.734
So if things don't work out
with you and your boyfriend...

34:53.734 --> 34:55.929
Oh, yeah..

34:55.929 --> 34:59.623
Yeah, that's something to think about.

34:59.623 --> 35:02.279
- Well, I'd better get back in there.
- Okay.

35:39.942 --> 35:42.199
You're leaving?

35:42.199 --> 35:46.091
We're going hunting.
I wanted to invite you.

35:46.091 --> 35:48.444
No, thank you.

35:48.444 --> 35:50.166
Your parents will be joining us.

35:50.166 --> 35:51.555
I can't. I have to take care of something.

35:51.555 --> 35:54.742
Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine.

35:54.742 --> 35:58.050
What do you mean?

35:58.050 --> 35:59.515
You know what it's like hunting.

35:59.515 --> 36:02.948
Accidents happen all the time.

36:02.948 --> 36:06.796
Don't worry.
I'll look after them.

37:04.328 --> 37:06.687
Police?

37:21.980 --> 37:24.645
What have I done?

37:38.552 --> 37:41.032
Hey. We're over here.

37:41.032 --> 37:43.885
It's okay. Go ahead.
We'll catch up.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.577
- Hey! Where's Natalie?
- The pregnant lady?

38:05.577 --> 38:09.003
She's with the boss.
They went hunting.

38:14.608 --> 38:16.463
All right, give me the page.

38:16.991 --> 38:18.396
- What?
- My father's journal.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.641
You stole a page.
Give it to me.

38:27.345 --> 38:29.965
Put it on.

38:29.965 --> 38:31.077
Why?

38:31.077 --> 38:35.362
There's gonna be an accident.
I told you, it happens all the time.

38:37.354 --> 38:41.120
- Hey! Have you seen Natalie?
- She's with Paul.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.941
- Back that way.
- I'm gonna have to borrow this.

38:47.172 --> 38:49.477
What... you just... you can't do this.

38:49.477 --> 38:51.858
Oh, I can't? Look up there.
See that well?

38:51.858 --> 38:55.908
Two weeks ago I shot my butler
and dropped his body in it.

38:58.201 --> 39:00.011
You should gone with me
to the prom, Natalie.

39:00.011 --> 39:02.610
Buchanan!
Lower the weapon.

39:02.610 --> 39:04.644
- Melville?
- Just lower it!

39:12.054 --> 39:15.682
Well, you're fired.
That goes without saying.

39:15.682 --> 39:18.160
Mr. Monk, look, his father
kept a journal.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.471
He came back before he died.

39:21.471 --> 39:23.708
Makes sense.

39:23.708 --> 39:25.616
It all makes sense now.

39:25.616 --> 39:28.784
His father died of a heart attack,
like the coroner said.

39:29.907 --> 39:32.304
Paul must have found him.

39:32.304 --> 39:34.335
But he had a problem.

39:34.335 --> 39:41.060
His stepmother would inherit everything,
and he would be completely cut out.

39:41.060 --> 39:43.660
- Unless...
- She died too.

39:43.660 --> 39:48.210
She not only had to die,
she had to die first.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.188
Or at least it had to look like it.

39:50.188 --> 39:54.519
Because if she died second,
even by a few minutes,

39:54.519 --> 39:57.044
her children would inherit everything.

39:57.044 --> 40:03.730
He got her to leave the house.
"Come quickly. There's been an accident."

40:05.669 --> 40:07.915
He brought her up to Sweeney Road.

40:07.915 --> 40:09.777
And that's where he killed her.

40:11.893 --> 40:14.031
Then he set the stage.

40:14.031 --> 40:16.267
You were right about the phone call.

40:16.267 --> 40:19.055
There was no signal.

40:19.055 --> 40:22.223
He had to walk a few miles to call 911.

40:22.223 --> 40:23.849
My wife!
She's dead!

40:23.849 --> 40:27.148
- Where are you?
- On Sweeney Road.

40:27.148 --> 40:29.956
Right near Spider Lake.
I'm feeling her pulse.

40:29.956 --> 40:32.256
She's definitely dead.
She's not breathing.

40:32.256 --> 40:35.513
Her neck is broken.
I don't think I... uh!

40:35.513 --> 40:37.965
Oh, God.
I can't breathe.

40:37.965 --> 40:39.392
- Sir?
- My heart!

40:39.392 --> 40:40.944
Are you all right?

40:40.944 --> 40:45.794
Imitating his father was easy. As Clara
had mentioned, you sounded just like him.

40:45.794 --> 40:47.770
So it was perfect.

40:47.770 --> 40:49.445
They were both dead.

40:49.445 --> 40:51.787
Your stepmother had obviously died first.

40:51.787 --> 40:55.075
- Who are you?
- This is my boss, Adrian Monk.

40:55.075 --> 40:58.548
Hello!
Sorry we're late.

40:58.893 --> 41:01.008
Hello, darling.

41:03.887 --> 41:08.058
Natalie?
When did this happen?

41:18.803 --> 41:21.883
- I told you I'd take care of it.
- What is it?

41:21.883 --> 41:24.356
It's from the deputy commissioner.
That's his signature.

41:24.356 --> 41:27.828
It says that you, Adrian Monk, are
exempt from the current hiring freeze,

41:27.828 --> 41:30.369
and when you are ready
to come back to work,

41:30.369 --> 41:32.687
your badge will be waiting for you.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.591
- How did you do that?
- I talked to the man. I laid it all out.

41:37.591 --> 41:39.878
- He threatened to quit.
- You did?

41:39.878 --> 41:44.389
Yeah, I was there. It was pretty intense.
And I seriously considered quitting.

41:44.389 --> 41:46.745
I wasn't bluffing.
I meant it.

41:46.745 --> 41:49.887
Me too.
You could tell I was about to consider it.

41:49.887 --> 41:53.711
- Leland, I don't know how to...
- Buy me lunch, we'll call it even.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.530
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

41:55.530 --> 41:58.410
- I was just...
- You're not my butler.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.284
- Oh, right.
- You're a cop.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.085
- I'm a cop.
- You're a cop.

42:02.085 --> 42:03.764
- You're a cop.
- I'm a cop.

42:03.764 --> 42:09.138
I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
