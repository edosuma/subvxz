00:00.968 --> 00:02.403
male announcer: IN THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.436 --> 00:04.038
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:04.072 --> 00:06.774
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.110
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.143 --> 00:11.145
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:11.179 --> 00:13.114
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:13.147 --> 00:14.582
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.051
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.423
- I'M STARTING A PETITION
TO FORCE THIS PLACE TO GO GREEN.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.691
- DON'T ROCK THE BOAT,
FRANKIE.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.159
- BUT I READ ONLINE THAT

00:25.193 --> 00:27.061
THE CHEMICALS THEY USE HERE
CAUSE THE BIG C.

00:27.095 --> 00:30.198
- AND THE THREE PACKS A DAY YOU
SMOKE AIN'T DOING YOU NO HARM.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.834
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
- STOP THE LINE, YOU IDIOT.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.137
[click, alarm blares]

00:36.170 --> 00:39.840
- FEMALE, EARLY 20s.
SERIOUS VAGINAL TRAUMA.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.542
UP TOP'S JUST AS BAD.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.810
- PRACTICALLY
CUT HER HEAD OFF.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.113
- JUGULAR AND CAROTID
WERE SEVERED.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.214
C.O.D.'S EXSANGUINATION.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.683
- WHERE ARE THE FIVE PINTS OF
BLOOD SHE'S MISSING?

00:49.717 --> 00:50.884
- NO ONE FOUND IT ON SITE.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.287
OF COURSE, IF SOMEBODY HERE
HAD DIRTY LAUNDRY TO CLEAN,

00:53.321 --> 00:55.089
THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.125
- SHE'S GOT SMALL CUTS
AND PUNCTURE WOUNDS

00:57.158 --> 00:59.493
ALL OVER HER BREASTS,
STOMACH, AND PELVIC AREA.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.229
THIS GUY'S A REAL SADIST.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.097
- WHAT'S WITH THE BINDINGS?
WHAT ARE THOSE?

01:03.131 --> 01:05.233
- LOOKS LIKE SILK-WRAPPED
ELECTRICAL CORD...

01:05.266 --> 01:06.800
FANCY DECORATORS USE.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.104
- TIME OF DEATH?
- RIGOR'S ALMOST DISSIPATED.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.205
I'D SAY TWO DAYS AGO.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.406
I'LL KNOW MORE
AFTER THE AUTOPSY.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.208
- ANYONE HERE
RECOGNIZE HER?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.244
- SUPERVISOR SAYS
SHE'S NOT AN EMPLOYEE.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.513
AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHEN SHE
CAN START THE MACHINES AGAIN.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.215
- DO WE KNOW
WHERE THE LOAD CAME FROM?

01:21.249 --> 01:23.351
- MERCY HOSPITAL.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.254
- THIS WAS NO MERCY KILLING.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.608
- THOSE OFFICERS SAID
I HAD TO TALK TO SVU.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.643
SO WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?
- RAPED AND MURDERED THE GIRL

02:22.676 --> 02:24.312
THAT YOU DROPPED OFF
AT THE LAUNDRY THIS MORNING.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.646
- YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

02:25.679 --> 02:29.783
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
AT THE PRECINCT.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.786
- WAIT. W-WAS SHE
IN THE LOAD FROM MERCY?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.623
- OH, FUNNY THAT YOU
WOULD KNOW THAT.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.259
- LISTEN, ALL I DID THERE
WAS SIGN OFF ON THREE CARTS.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.728
THE GUY ROLLED THEM OUT FOR ME
WHILE I HIT THE HEAD.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.530
- WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.632
- AROUND 4:30 THIS MORNING.
- THEN HOW COME YOU DIDN'T

02:44.665 --> 02:48.236
MAKE YOUR NEXT PICKUP ONLY
FIVE BLOCKS AWAY UNTIL 5:22?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.703
GOT BLADDER PROBLEMS?

02:49.737 --> 02:51.705
- IF YOU THINK I KILLED HER,
YOU'RE CRAZY.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.541
- SAYS THE GUY
WHO WANTS US TO BELIEVE

02:53.574 --> 02:54.875
HE TOOK A 50-MINUTE LEAK.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.878
- OKAY, MY GIRLFRIEND JANICE
IS A NURSE AT MERCY.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.980
I POPPED IN TO SAY HI.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.415
IT WAS A LITTLE SLOW.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.317
WE DUCKED INTO AN EMPTY ROOM,
TO, UH...

03:03.351 --> 03:04.885
- PLAY DOCTOR?

03:04.918 --> 03:07.421
- I SWEAR,
I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.890
I JUST WANTED TO GET LAID.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.859
- I WAS ON BREAK AT 4:30.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.395
- GETTING PORKED
BY YOUR BOYFRIEND.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.929
- ANOTHER NURSE
WAS COVERING FOR ME.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.266
I DIDN'T ENDANGER
ANY OF MY PATIENTS.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.601
- LIKE THIS ONE?
- SHE WASN'T MINE.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.236
- WOULD YOUR BOYFRIEND HAVE

03:22.270 --> 03:23.637
HAULED OUT A CORPSE
FOR ANYONE ELSE?

03:23.671 --> 03:24.938
- NOT KNOWINGLY.

03:24.972 --> 03:28.409
BUT JOE IN HOUSEKEEPING
HANDLES OVERNIGHT LAUNDRY.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.778
KIND OF A CREEP.
MAYBE HE DUMPED THE BODY.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.713
- LOVEBIRDS WEREN'T LYING.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.814
JOE WAS ALL ALONE
WITH THE CART.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.584
- SCHEDULE SAYS THAT LOAD OF
LAUNDRY CAME FROM PEDES.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.752
NO WAY OUR JANE DOE
WAS A PATIENT THERE.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.988
- MORGUE MISSING ANY BODIES?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.923
- ALL DBs
PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.592
- HOLD ON,
WHAT'S THIS GUY DOING?

03:44.625 --> 03:45.859
- HOW THE HELL'D I MISS THAT?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.395
- MAYBE YOU WERE
ON A DOUGHNUT RUN.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.263
[cell phone rings]
- KILLER WAS DRIVING AROUND

03:49.297 --> 03:50.431
LOOKING FOR
THE PERFECT DUMP SITE.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.801
THEN HE HITS THE JACKPOT:
AN UNATTENDED LAUNDRY TRUCK.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.903
- CAN YOU SEE THE PLATES?
- STABLER.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.538
- ANGLE'S ALL WRONG.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.673
- OKAY, A CAR THAT BOXY
HAS TO BE AN OLD VOLVO,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.875
AND ONLY HALF OF NEW YORK
ARE DRIVING THEM.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.844
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO I.D. THE OWNER.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.046
- WELL, WE JUST GOT BETTER LUCK
WITH OUR VICTIM.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.382
- SAMANTHA MILLERTON, 23.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.850
- WHY IS SHE IN THE SYSTEM?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.620
- LOITERING, RESISTING ARREST.
MAINLY POLITICAL RALLIES.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.987
- LATEST COLLAR
WAS FOR TRESPASSING

04:14.021 --> 04:15.389
AT THE GLOBE OIL HEADQUARTERS.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.958
PROBABLY PROTESTING
THEIR LATEST OIL SPILL.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.060
- SHE WORKED FOR
AN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.962
- YEAH, IT'S AN OUTFIT CALLED
C.L.E.A.N.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.298
COLLECTIVE LIVING ENVIRONMENT
OF ARTISTS FOR NATURE.

04:24.332 --> 04:27.535
WORKS OUT OF AN OLD FACTORY
ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.

04:30.070 --> 04:33.641
ANY CORPORATE TARGETS ESPECIALLY
UNHAPPY WITH YOUR ARTWORK?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.042
- ALL OF THEM.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.977
BUT GLOBE OIL WENT BALLISTIC.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.712
- HOW SO?

04:38.746 --> 04:41.949
- I FILMED THIS DURING
OUR LAST PROTEST THERE.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.986
THAT'S GLOBE OIL'S SLIMY CEO,
NICHOLAS TURNER.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.089
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
STOP FILMING, NOW!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.959
- NOT UNTIL YOU PAY TO CLEAN UP
THE HUNDREDS OF MILES

04:51.992 --> 04:54.895
OF VIRGIN WILDERNESS
POLLUTED BY YOUR OIL SPILL.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.065
- I PREFER TO GET THE TRASH
OFF MY OWN PROPERTY FIRST.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.568
COLLECT THE GARBAGE.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.572
[scuffling, protesters shouting]

05:04.605 --> 05:08.041
- I'M GONNA SHOW THE WORLD WHAT
YOU'RE REALLY MADE OF, TURNER!

05:08.075 --> 05:09.743
- WHAT WAS SAMANTHA
GOING TO SHOW THE WORLD?

05:09.777 --> 05:10.778
- AN EFFIGY OF TURNER,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.881
MADE OUT OF CRAP SHE FOUND
FROM HIS OWN TRASH.

05:13.914 --> 05:18.419
NICHOLAS TURNER EMBODIES
THE EXCESSES OF THE SUPER-RICH.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.053
THE FRAME
IS MADE FROM HIS EMPTY

05:20.087 --> 05:22.089
CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD
WINE CRATES.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.893
- SILK PAJAMA BOTTOMS STUFFED
WITH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.362
NOW, WHY THROW OUT
THE ITALIAN LOAFERS?

05:28.396 --> 05:31.064
THEY LOOK BRAND-NEW.
- THEY'RE SLIGHTLY SCUFFED.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.067
- OH, A VIAGRA BOTTLE
IN TURNER'S NAME.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.903
OH, FOR HIS NOSE.
I GET THAT.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.571
IT'S NICE.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.940
- SAM WAS GOING TO DOUSE THIS
IN GLOBE OIL GASOLINE

05:39.973 --> 05:42.710
AND LIGHT IT ON FIRE
AT OUR NEXT RALLY.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.044
- AND, UH, NO MOUTH,

05:44.077 --> 05:45.779
BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRED
OF HEARING TURNER'S LIES?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.815
- SHE HADN'T FOUND THE PERFECT
PIECE OF GARBAGE YET.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.717
- MAYBE SHE DID.
AT TURNER'S HOUSE.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.952
SILK-WRAPPED
PINK ELECTRICAL CORDS

05:51.985 --> 05:54.722
WOULD MAKE
A PERFECT PAIR OF LIPS.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.657
- WHAT, DO YOU THINK
HE CAUGHT HER IN THE ACT

05:56.690 --> 05:58.025
AND WANTED TO
TEACH HER A LESSON?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.060
- THAT'S WIRING
FROM TWO LAMPS

06:00.093 --> 06:02.129
MY WIFE HAS
IN HER DRESSING ROOM.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.732
ONE BROKE,
SO I TOSSED THEM.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.167
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK
I MURDERED THAT GIRL.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.769
- WELL, WE HAVE IT
ON GOOD AUTHORITY

06:08.802 --> 06:10.938
THAT SHE WAS AT YOUR PLACE
THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.641
- I GOT HOME AROUND 2:00 A.M.
AFTER A FUNDRAISER

06:13.674 --> 06:16.944
AND FOUND THAT TERRORIST
PICKING THROUGH MY REFUSE.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.080
THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME
I'D CAUGHT HER ON MY PROPERTY.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.016
- AND THIS TIME YOU MADE YOUR
PROBLEM GO AWAY PERMANENTLY?

06:23.050 --> 06:26.520
- THAT WAS THE PLAN.
I CALLED THE POLICE.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.622
- THERE'S NO RECORD OF HER
BEING ARRESTED THAT NIGHT.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.158
- SHE TOOK OFF RUNNING
BEFORE THEY GOT THERE,

06:31.191 --> 06:34.662
SCREECHING ABOUT HOW
MY CARBON FOOTPRINT WAS SO BIG

06:34.695 --> 06:36.964
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PLACES
TO FIND DIRT ON ME.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.032
- COULD SHE HAVE GONE DIGGING
IN YOUR DUMPSTER

06:39.066 --> 06:40.634
HERE AT GLOBE OIL?

06:40.668 --> 06:44.104
- CHECK WITH SECURITY.
AND BUGGER OFF.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.006
- GLOBE OIL DOESN'T HAVE
A SECURITY CAMERA

06:46.039 --> 06:47.475
IN THE GARBAGE AREA.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.610
BUT A TIMES SQUARE CAM'S
AT 49TH AND BROADWAY.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.112
- RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM
GLOBE OIL'S CORPORATE OFFICES.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.982
- AND THERE SHE IS.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.018
ONE HOUR AFTER LEAVING
NICHOLAS TURNER'S HOME.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.588
- AND THAT'S WHEN OUR PERP
ARRIVED IN HIS VOLVO.

07:00.621 --> 07:04.057
- UNFORTUNATELY, HIS CAR BLOCKS
OUR VIEW OF THE ATTACK.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.192
FAST FORWARD.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.560
[click]

07:08.496 --> 07:09.797
Benson: HE BLITZED HER.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.098
HE THREW HER IN THE BACK

07:11.131 --> 07:12.933
AND TOOK OFF
WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING IT.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.068
- PERP HAD BALLS
DOING IT IN THE OPEN.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.103
HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.739
- OH, SAME GUY, SAME CAR,
SAME HAT AND HOODIE

07:18.772 --> 07:20.240
SHOWS UP TWO DAYS LATER
AT MERCY HOSPITAL,

07:20.273 --> 07:22.175
AND HE DUMPS SAM'S BODY
IN THAT LAUNDRY CART.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.044
- WE GET A PLATE THIS TIME?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.079
- YEAH, FIN'S RUNNING IT.
- WE HIT A DEAD END.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.916
CAR'S REGISTERED
TO A THOMAS GAMBEL, 64.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.085
HE LIVED IN BROOKLYN UNTIL
HE DIED NINE MONTHS AGO.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.756
- HEY, NEED A HAND?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.891
- I GOT IT, THANKS.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.761
- THOMAS GAMBEL?
HE LIVED HERE?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.597
- YEAH, I'M HIS SON, JASON.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.198
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.535
- THE VOLVO WAGON
STILL REGISTERED TO HIM.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.936
- I ONLY INHERITED THE HOUSE.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.772
MY...BROTHER, HENRY,
GOT THE CAR.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.206
- HENRY.
WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.042
- HE WAS THE BLACK SHEEP
OF THE FAMILY.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.844
WE HAVEN'T STAYED IN TOUCH.

07:56.877 --> 08:00.013
I HAVE HIS ADDRESS INSIDE.
LET ME GET IT FOR YOU.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.784
[lock clicks]

08:03.817 --> 08:06.119
- DID HE JUST LOCK US OUT?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.088
[jiggling doorknob]

08:08.121 --> 08:10.223
- OKAY.
MR. GAMBEL?

08:10.257 --> 08:11.792
OPEN THE DOOR.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.027
[gunshots]

08:14.061 --> 08:16.997
- SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL.
10-13.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.265
SHOTS FIRED.

08:18.298 --> 08:22.736
REQUEST BACKUP
AT 435 CARLTON AVENUE.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.509
- GAMBEL, FREEZE!

08:41.989 --> 08:43.857
- YOU CRACKED MY HEAD OPEN!

08:43.891 --> 08:45.158
- 'CAUSE YOU
TRIED TO BLOW OURS OFF!

08:45.192 --> 08:46.760
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

08:46.794 --> 08:48.161
FOR THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF A POLICE OFFICER.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.698
- LET'S SEE
WHAT'S IN YOUR LITTLE BOX.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.967
A BRACELET
MADE OUT OF BOTTLE CAPS.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.836
THIS LOOKS LIKE
SAMANTHA'S WORK.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.672
- YEAH, COULDN'T LEAVE YOUR
RAPE TROPHIES BEHIND?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.240
- SAM WAS A TREE HUGGER.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.777
I DON'T THINK SHE'D BE WEARING
ANYTHING MADE OUT OF IVORY.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.614
SHE WAS SINGLE, SO THIS
ISN'T HER ENGAGEMENT RING.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.049
I BET IT'S NOT HER BROOCH,
EITHER...

09:09.082 --> 09:10.818
OR HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.287
- ALL THESE FROM
YOUR DIFFERENT VICTIMS?

09:16.924 --> 09:20.093
- SON OF A BITCH
IS A SERIAL KILLER.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.366
- WE GOT YOU ON
SAMANTHA MILLERTON'S MURDER.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.935
SEE, OUR LAB FOUND
HER FINGERPRINT

09:27.968 --> 09:30.170
ON ONE OF
THESE BOTTLE CAPS.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.339
- WHO DID YOU KILL
FOR THAT ONE?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.875
- THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT BELONGS
TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.112
IS THAT HER LACE HANKY, TOO?

09:39.146 --> 09:41.014
DO YOU LIKE DIDDLING GRANDMAS?

09:41.048 --> 09:43.316
- "ALAN AND JOAN FOREVER."

09:43.350 --> 09:45.318
YOU MADE SURE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.920
- I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.121
- WELL, YOU DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB

09:48.155 --> 09:49.790
TRYING TO TAKE US OUT
WITH YOUR .357.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.025
- YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER
JOB STASHING SAM'S BODY.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.961
YOU SEE, THAT, WITH YOUR
LITTLE TROPHY COLLECTION,

09:53.994 --> 09:56.063
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE DEATH PENALTY.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.998
- NEW YORK STATE DOESN'T
EXECUTE PEOPLE ANYMORE.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.033
- HEY, KNOW-IT-ALL,
YOU COULD STILL BE CHARGED

10:00.067 --> 10:01.101
WITH A CAPITAL CRIME,

10:01.134 --> 10:03.270
EVEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE
MORATORIUM IN EFFECT.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.072
- YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE GONNA LIFT IT.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.841
ONE DAY YOU'RE GROWING OLD
ON DEATH ROW...

10:07.875 --> 10:10.844
AND THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE SIZZLING
LIKE A PIECE OF BACON.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.112
- OKAY.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.081
GAMBEL, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.017
TELL US EVERYTHING, AND
THE D.A. WILL CUT YOU A DEAL.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.124
YOU WANT TO ROT IN PRISON
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.358
YOU GOT IT!

10:25.392 --> 10:27.928
- YOU CAN'T PUT ME
BACK IN PRISON!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.030
NO, THESE THINGS AREN'T MINE!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.132
- SO YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO FIND A BRACELET

10:32.165 --> 10:33.867
BELONGING TO A MURDER VICTIM

10:33.901 --> 10:35.803
WHOSE BODY WAS THROWN
FROM YOUR CAR?

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.072
- I'VE GOT FIVE TROPHIES
RIGHT HERE,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.975
AND WE'RE GONNA
FIND THESE WOMEN.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.746
MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF.
JUST GIVE US THE NAMES.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.249
[knock at door]

10:49.282 --> 10:52.820
- YOU GOT A MINUTE,
DETECTIVES?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.932
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.767
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
INTERVIEW A PERP

11:06.800 --> 11:08.468
WHO JUST TRIED TO KILL YOU.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.071
- BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NOT A THREAT NOW.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.372
- YOU PUNISH HIM
BY CRACKING HIS SKULL?

11:12.405 --> 11:13.741
- HE GOT THAT
DURING THE CHASE.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.375
SERIOUSLY, CAPTAIN,
WE'RE GOOD.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.945
- YOU ARE NOT
CLEARED FOR DUTY

11:17.978 --> 11:20.981
UNTIL YOU SEE DR. WONG
FOR YOUR MANDATORY PSYCH EVALS.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.051
- CAPTAIN, THAT PISSANT
IS ABOUT TO POP.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.919
- WELL, FIN
IS GOING TO DO THE POPPING.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.421
- SORRY, GUYS.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.927
WANNABE COP KILLER, HUH?

11:33.961 --> 11:36.263
CAME A LONG WAY
FROM EMBEZZLEMENT.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.068
SAYS HERE YOU DID
SEVEN YEARS AT COXSACKIE.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.936
- I WAS GREEDY.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.738
TRUST ME,
I MORE THAN PAID MY DEBT.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.439
- POOR LITTLE JASON.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.176
STILL ANGRY ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT
BY YOUR FEMALE BOSS.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.845
- SHE WAS JUST DOING HER JOB.
I WAS STUPID.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.946
- NO, YOU WERE FURIOUS.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.848
AND YOU SPENT
SEVEN YEARS IN THAT CELL

11:54.882 --> 11:56.917
THINKING ABOUT
HOW THAT BITCH SCREWED YOU.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE I GOT OUT.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.954
- SO YOU TOOK OUT
FIVE OTHER GIRLS INSTEAD.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.189
THEN YOU CAUGHT

12:02.222 --> 12:04.925
SAMANTHA MILLERTON
OUTSIDE OF GLOBE OIL.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.160
TORTURED HER FOR TWO DAYS
BEFORE YOU KILLED HER.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.328
- I'M NOT A KILLER.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.263
- MAYBE NOT BEFORE
YOU WENT INTO PRISON.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.133
BUT IT HAS A WAY OF MAKING
MILD-MANNERED PUNKS LIKE YOU

12:13.166 --> 12:14.301
INTO ANIMALS EVERY DAY.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.169
- DON'T SEND ME BACK.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.338
I SWEAR, I DIDN'T DO IT.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.308
- YOU ALSO SWORE YOU HAD
A BROTHER NAMED HENRY.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.843
NO SUCH PERSON.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.212
SO HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
DRIVING YOUR VOLVO.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.014
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THE CAR IS.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.281
THE ONLY TIME
I LEAVE THE HOUSE

12:28.315 --> 12:30.017
IS TO WALK
TO THE CORNER BODEGA.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.485
THE ONLY PERSON I SEE
IS MY PAROLE OFFICER.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.321
- WE GOTTA
TALK TO HIS P.O.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.089
- MAYBE THE GUNSHOTS
AFFECTED YOUR HEARING.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.391
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO ANYBODY
UNTIL WONG CLEARS YOU.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.393
- WE'RE ON OUR WAY NOW,
CAPTAIN.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.068
- JASON GAMBEL
IS A MODEL PAROLEE.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.070
- HE KILLED FIVE WOMEN.
ON YOUR WATCH.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.504
- HOW?
THIS SCHLUB WAS A MESS.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.040
HE COULDN'T EVEN
LEAVE HIS HOUSE.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.975
- HOW OFTEN DID YOU
REALLY CHECK IN ON HIM?

12:55.008 --> 12:57.010
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU GOT,
50, 60 PAROLEES?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.545
- 106.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.948
ALL OF THEM MORE HARDENED
THAN THAT LOSER.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.182
- SO YOU NEVER
PICKED UP ON ANYTHING.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.252
- MAYBE HE WAS ACTING A LITTLE
MORE SQUIRRELLY THAN USUAL.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.455
A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE GUY STARTS
CANCELING HOME VISITS.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.923
SAYS HE WAS SICK.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.092
WHEN I DID SEE HIM,
HE WAS A NERVOUS WRECK.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.194
- WELL, MAYBE HE HAD ONE OF
THE VICTIMS IN HIS HOUSE.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.096
- I JUST FIGURED HE WAS USING.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.065
BUT HIS PISS TEST
CAME BACK CLEAN.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.199
- AND SO THAT'S IT?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.533
DID YOU EVER
INSPECT HIS PLACE?

13:20.567 --> 13:21.969
- NO.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.403
BUT LAST TIME
I WAS THERE,

13:23.436 --> 13:27.374
I NOTICED
A DOOR WAS PADLOCKED.

13:27.407 --> 13:31.178
WELL,
I CAN'T CHECK EVERYTHING.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.454
- GAMBEL'S TORTURE CHAMBER.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.291
THE WALLS ARE SO THICK,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.126
YOU'D NEVER HEAR THE SCREAMS
FROM THE STREET.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.327
- HE RAPES THEM
ON THE MATTRESS

13:47.360 --> 13:50.530
THEN LAYS OUT THE PLASTIC
SHEETING WHERE HE TORTURES THEM.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.506
GAMBEL'S TORTURE EQUIPMENT.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.374
- IT'S THE PERFECT SETUP.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.877
GRABS THE GIRL.
HE PARKS IN THE GARAGE.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.313
HE DRAGS HER DOWN HERE WITHOUT
ANYONE EVER SEEING A THING.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.115
- THERE'S BLOOD BY THE DRAIN.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.450
- FROM THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
TO THE SEWER.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.119
- SMELLS LIKE HE TRIED TO CLEAN
UP WITH BLEACH.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.120
- HE RAPES THEM,
HE KILLS THEM,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.122
HE SLITS THEIR THROAT
TO DRAIN THEIR BLOOD.

14:15.155 --> 14:19.492
- LET'S SEE IF GAMBEL CAN
EXPLAIN HIS WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.528
[door bangs open]

14:21.561 --> 14:23.196
- WE FOUND YOUR
RAPE AND TORTURE CHAMBER.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.597
- I NEVER USED THAT ROOM.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.666
- YOU'RE LUCKY THAT
WE CAN'T INTERROGATE YOU

14:26.699 --> 14:28.668
USING SOME OF
YOUR OWN METHODS.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.038
- SO YOUR BAG OF GOODIES
AND ALL THE BLOOD DOWN THE DRAIN

14:31.071 --> 14:33.606
JUST MAGICALLY APPEARED?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.909
- YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME!

14:35.943 --> 14:37.911
- OUR TECHS DETERMINED
THAT SOME OF THE CONCRETE

14:37.945 --> 14:40.213
ON YOUR BASEMENT FLOOR
HAS BEEN RECENTLY REPLACED.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.983
SO WE'RE USING SONAR
TO LOOK FOR BODIES.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.585
- WE HAVE CADAVER DOGS
SEARCHING YOUR WHOLE YARD.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.387
WE'RE GOING TO FIND
EVERY ONE OF YOUR VICTIMS.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.456
- I NEVER KILLED ANYONE.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.291
- AND WHEN WE RECOVER YOUR CAR,

14:51.324 --> 14:55.028
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR PRINTS
AND SAM'S BLOOD ALL OVER IT.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.964
- I NEED A WORD.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.099
- CAN IT WAIT?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.467
- NO.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.676
- GOT A HIT ON
ONE OF GAMBEL'S TROPHIES.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.111
- WHICH ONE?

15:11.144 --> 15:13.981
- THE ENGAGEMENT RING.
"ALAN AND JOAN FOREVER."

15:14.014 --> 15:15.215
- SO YOU GOT JOAN'S
LAST NAME?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.984
- A JOAN ARLISS
WAS WALKING DOWN 116TH STREET

15:17.017 --> 15:18.218
WHEN A MAN GRABBED HER,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.053
PULLED HER INTO THE ALLEY,
AND RAPED HER.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.555
THE ONLY THING HE TOOK WAS
A RING THAT MATCHES THIS ONE.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.457
IT WAS NEVER RECOVERED.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.426
- WE GOT GAMBEL
ON ANOTHER VICTIM.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.128
- ONLY PROBLEM IS,
HE'S GOT A SOLID ALIBI.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.064
- WHICH IS WHAT?
- HE WASN'T EVEN BORN YET.

15:31.098 --> 15:35.635
- JOAN ARLISS WAS RAPED
FEBRUARY 19, 1970.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.413
- WE MATCHED EACH TROPHY
WITH A VICTIM.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.349
ONLY SAMANTHA MILLERTON'S
IS A CURRENT CASE.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.585
ALL THE OTHER CASES
ARE AROUND 40 YEARS OLD.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.355
- HOW DID YOU I.D.
THE OLDER VICTIMS?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.290
- WE DUG AROUND
FILES IN STORAGE,

15:57.324 --> 16:00.227
COMBED THROUGH DEATH
AND DMV RECORDS,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.262
SEARCHED OLD
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.231
- WHAT ABOUT DNA LEFT ON THEM?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.598
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
SEX PERVS

16:05.632 --> 16:07.700
LIKE TO RELIVE THEIR CONQUESTS
OVER AND OVER.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.768
- THE LAB IS STILL CHECKING,

16:08.801 --> 16:11.204
BUT ANYTHING THEY DO FIND
WILL LIKELY BE DEGRADED.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.273
- GAMBEL'S IN HIS 30s,
SO HE COULD ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE

16:13.306 --> 16:15.408
FOR SAMANTHA'S MURDER.
WHO'S THE OTHER KILLER?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.544
- WELL, IF GAMBEL KNOWS,
HE'S NOT TALKING.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.811
HE INVOKED THIS MORNING.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.381
- WHY CLAM UP WHEN HE COULDN'T
HAVE COMMITTED THE OTHER CRIMES?

16:21.414 --> 16:24.084
- MY GUESS--HE REALIZED
HE HAS A BARGAINING CHIP.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.118
- INDEED HE DOES.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.220
- MIRANDA POND.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.122
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WORKED
FOR BOTTOM-FEEDERS.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.691
- MY CLIENT WILL ONLY TALK
IN EXCHANGE FOR IMMUNITY

16:31.724 --> 16:33.260
ON SAMANTHA MILLERTON.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.562
- A FREE PASS ON A VICIOUS RAPE
AND MURDER? FORGET IT.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.630
- THEN FORGET
KNOWING THE WHOLE STORY.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.299
IT'S A PITY, REALLY.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.170
THOSE POOR VICTIMS,
THEIR STORIES NEVER BEING TOLD.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.172
- GAMBEL TELLS US EVERYTHING
ABOUT THOSE TROPHIES

16:45.205 --> 16:47.207
AND WHO COLLECTED THEM...

16:47.240 --> 16:50.077
ONLY THEN WILL WE
DISCUSS A PLEA.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.679
- I'LL PASS THAT ALONG
TO MY BOTTOM-FEEDER.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.281
- ARRAIGNMENT'S
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.749
SO HE'D BETTER DECIDE IF
THE PERSON HE'S COVERING FOR

16:56.783 --> 16:59.386
IS MORE VALUABLE
THAN HIS OWN ASS.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.324
- WHO DOES GAMBEL KNOW WHO COULD
HAVE BEEN RAPING 40 YEARS AGO?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.825
HIS OLD MAN?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.128
- HIS FATHER
WAS 64 WHEN HE DIED.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.763
HE HAS NO OTHER
LIVING MALE RELATIVES.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.666
IF GAMBEL SENIOR DID IT,
WHY DIDN'T JUNIOR SPILL IT?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.302
- FAMILY HONOR'S
A FUNNY THING.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.270
- NOTHING'S FUNNY
AT THE GAMBEL FAMILY.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.239
TECHS SEARCHED THE HOUSE,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.708
FOUND THIS PHOTO OF GAMBEL'S
FATHER FROM THE '60s.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.710
- ALL WE NEED NOW
IS ONE OF OUR OLD VICTIMS

17:23.743 --> 17:26.213
TO I.D. HIM AS THEIR RAPIST.
- WE'RE IN LUCK.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.781
I TRACKED DOWN
JOAN ARLISS'S ADDRESS.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.151
- I JUST WISH THERE WAS
SOME OTHER WAY TO DO THIS

17:31.184 --> 17:32.685
WITHOUT DRAGGING HER DOWN
MEMORY LANE.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.687
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO BE DRAGGING YOU

17:34.721 --> 17:36.123
DOWN TO WONG'S OFFICE.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.191
THIS IS SERIOUS.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.459
ONE P.P. GOT WIND
OF THE SHOOTING.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.194
THEY'RE CRAWLING UP MY ASS

17:41.228 --> 17:43.396
WANTING TO KNOW WHY YOU HAVEN'T
HAD YOUR PSYCH EVALS YET.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.532
YOU. GO.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.866
- MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT OVER WITH.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.635
- I'LL TALK TO JOAN.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.505
- MY MOM'S HAD ADVANCED
ALZHEIMER'S

17:52.539 --> 17:55.242
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.245
EVEN IF SHE WAS AWAKE,

17:58.278 --> 18:00.147
THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.748
- ARE YOU HER SOLE CAREGIVER?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.384
- UH, YEAH.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.852
OH, YOU THINK BECAUSE
OF ALL THE INK

18:05.885 --> 18:07.387
I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HER?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.189
YOU SHOULD SEE ME
BEFORE I SOBERED UP.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.291
I WAS A WRECK.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.292
- NO, I'M SORRY, I MEANT

18:12.325 --> 18:15.228
TAKING CARE OF AN INVALID
IS A LOT OF WORK.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.130
- YEAH.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.765
BEFORE MY DAD DIED,

18:18.798 --> 18:21.201
I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD
KEEP HER AT HOME

18:21.234 --> 18:23.303
AS LONG AS I COULD,
SO I DO IT FOR HIM.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT?

18:28.375 --> 18:31.378
[plastic rustles]

18:31.411 --> 18:34.614
WE RECOVERED
HER ENGAGEMENT RING.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.482
- OH, I'M SORRY.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.484
YOU MUST HAVE
THE WRONG JOAN ARLISS.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
SHE HAS HERS ON.
- UM...

18:39.219 --> 18:41.921
SHE PROBABLY REPLACED IT.
THIS WAS STOLEN 40 YEARS AGO.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.392
- REALLY? SHE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.927
BOY, YOU ROBBERY COPS
NEVER GIVE UP, DO YA?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.629
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.331
WHY DID YOU GO THROUGH
ALL THE TROUBLE

18:51.364 --> 18:54.234
TO TRACK HER DOWN?

18:55.302 --> 18:57.437
- UM...

18:57.470 --> 18:59.439
I THINK I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.974
I'VE TAKEN UP
ENOUGH OF YOUR TIME.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.314
- HEY.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.618
HEY, DETECTIVE.
WAIT!

19:11.651 --> 19:13.320
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.921
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO MY MOTHER?

19:14.954 --> 19:17.357
- I WAS JUST TRACING BACK
THE RING.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.625
- TO WHAT?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.494
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.
DETECTIVE, TELL ME.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.933
- VIVIAN,
I'M NOT A ROBBERY DETECTIVE.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.835
I'M WITH SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.803
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
ENGAGEMENT RING

19:30.837 --> 19:35.475
WAS RECOVERED DURING A RECENT
RAPE AND MURDER INVESTIGATION.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.877
- SO THE VICTIM
HAD MY MOM'S RING?

19:37.910 --> 19:40.447
- HER ATTACKER DID.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.216
SOMETIMES MEN TAKE A SOUVENIR
FROM THE ASSAULT.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.452
- WAIT, WAIT, WA--
W-WHOSE ATTACKER?

19:45.485 --> 19:48.221
MY MOM'S--
MY MOM'S ATTACKER?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.793
MY MOM WAS RAPED.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.462
WHEN?

19:56.896 --> 19:59.266
- IN FEBRUARY OF 1970.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.501
- 1970.

20:05.004 --> 20:09.976
I WAS BORN NOVEMBER 1970.
NOVEMBER 1970.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.878
SO THAT'S LIKE NINE MONTHS.
- CATCH IT, MOM!

20:11.911 --> 20:13.713
- ALMOST EXACTLY--STOP!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.984
- VIVIAN, I--
I'M SORRY.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.327
- WHAT'D YOU DO TO MY MOM?

20:29.496 --> 20:30.463
- SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.665
SHE JUST...

20:32.699 --> 20:34.967
SHE JUST GOT SOME BAD NEWS,
AND SHE'S A LITTLE UPSET.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.671
- SHE'S GONNA HAVE ANOTHER
ONE OF HER HEADACHES.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.440
SHE NEVER WANTS ME AROUND.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.875
NOT UNTIL HER PILLS
MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.554
- VIVIAN. VIVIAN.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.590
DON'T BREAK
YOUR SOBRIETY, PLEASE.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.034
VIVIAN, MIXING YOUR MOTHER'S
PRESCRIPTION PILLS WITH ALCOHOL

21:08.067 --> 21:10.537
CAN BE REALLY DANGEROUS.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.539
- [laughs]

21:12.572 --> 21:14.441
MY MOTHER BEING RAPED
IS BAD ENOUGH.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.543
BUT TO FIND OUT
THE RAPIST IS MY FATHER...

21:16.576 --> 21:18.411
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.947
- YES, I DO!
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.683
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:23.716 --> 21:26.553
- I MEAN MY MOTHER HATED ME
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.522
SHE COULDN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT ME.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.058
'CAUSE I WAS
THAT BASTARD'S DAUGHTER.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.063
- I KNOW HOW HARD
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR YOU.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.600
- YOU KNOW HOW HARD THAT
MUST HAVE BEEN FOR ME?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.570
WONDERING ALL THE TIME WHY
YOUR MOTHER NEVER HUGGED YOU

21:43.603 --> 21:47.340
OR HELD YOUR HAND
OR SANG TO YOU AT NIGHT.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.844
EVERY DAY, I-I--

21:51.878 --> 21:54.080
I REMINDED HER OF THE WORST
EXPERIENCE OF HER LIFE.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.615
WHY DIDN'T SHE

21:55.648 --> 21:58.985
PUT ME UP FOR ADOPTION
OR ABORT ME OR--OR--

21:59.018 --> 22:04.391
WHY...WHY DID SHE HAVE
TO RUIN BOTH OF OUR LIVES?

22:04.424 --> 22:07.994
- I'VE ASKED MYSELF THAT EXACT
QUESTION OVER AND OVER.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.962
I'M LIKE YOU, VIVIAN.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.865
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:12.899 --> 22:16.403
- MY MOTHER WAS RAPED TOO.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.375
- [sniffles]

22:24.644 --> 22:25.945
DID SHE TELL YOU?

22:25.978 --> 22:28.981
- WHEN I WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.117
BUT...

22:31.150 --> 22:33.152
THAT DIDN'T STOP HER FOR...

22:33.185 --> 22:36.723
FOR BLAMING ME FOR ALL
THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE HAD.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.026
- YOU MUST HAVE
HATED HER TOO, RIGHT?

22:40.059 --> 22:42.128
- AT TIMES.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.898
BUT I UNDERSTAND HER
A LOT BETTER NOW.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.001
AND SHE WAS SMART
AND TALENTED

22:49.035 --> 22:52.004
AND BEAUTIFUL.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.975
AND BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET
THE SUPPORT THAT SHE WANTED...

22:56.008 --> 22:59.712
SHE DRANK HERSELF TO DEATH.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.023
- HEY, AT LEAST I HAD
A DAD THAT LOVED ME, RIGHT?

23:11.057 --> 23:13.426
I MEAN, HE WASN'T REALLY
MY DAD, BUT--[laughs]

23:13.460 --> 23:17.063
I DON'T--I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF HE KNEW.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.998
IF HE DID,
HE NEVER SHOWED IT

23:19.031 --> 23:21.000
BECAUSE, UM...

23:21.033 --> 23:24.036
HE ALWAYS SAID
HE WOULD LOVE ME, YOU KNOW.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.507
OH, GOD,
HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.975
I MEAN, HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN MY REAL FATHER.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.578
- HE WAS.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.447
AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.549
NOTHING.

23:36.583 --> 23:40.787
THAT OTHER MAN...

23:40.820 --> 23:43.556
THAT OTHER MAN WAS NOTHING.

23:45.124 --> 23:49.128
- AND YOU SAID YOU...
YOU CAPTURED HIM.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.564
- WE HAVE A SUSPECT IN MIND

23:51.598 --> 23:52.965
WHO'S DEAD.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.135
I WANTED TO SHOW
HIS PICTURE TO YOUR MOTHER,

23:56.168 --> 23:57.804
AND HOPEFULLY,
SHE COULD I.D. HIM

23:57.837 --> 24:00.573
AND WE CAN CLOSE THE CASE.

24:00.607 --> 24:04.176
- SO TELL ME--
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

24:04.210 --> 24:09.081
- YOUR MOTHER WAS WALKING
DOWN 116TH STREET

24:09.115 --> 24:12.118
VERY LATE AT NIGHT,
AND SHE WAS BLITZ-ATTACKED.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.186
DRAGGED HER INTO AN ALLEY.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.591
- NEAR BARNARD IN THE 1970s.
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?

24:18.625 --> 24:21.127
- IT WASN'T HER FAULT.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.266
WAIT. WAS YOUR MOTHER
A STUDENT THERE?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.803
- SHE NEVER GRADUATED.
SHE HAD ME INSTEAD.

24:30.837 --> 24:34.140
[sniffles]
ANOTHER REASON TO HATE ME.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.013
- YOU THINK THAT VIVIAN ARLISS
IS YOUR HALF-SISTER?

24:41.047 --> 24:43.516
- EVERYTHING MATCHES.

24:43.550 --> 24:47.186
BOTH OF OUR MOTHERS
WENT TO THE SAME COLLEGE.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.856
THEY WERE ATTACKED
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.858
VIVIAN'S MOTHER
EVEN LOOKS LIKE MINE.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.926
SHE HAS DARK HAIR,
SHE'S TALL, SHE'S THIN.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.229
I MEAN...LOTS OF RAPISTS
HAVE A TYPE.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.999
- THE POSSIBILITY
THAT JOE HOLLISTER

25:00.032 --> 25:03.002
IS BOTH YOUR FATHER
AND VIVIAN'S IS SO REMOTE.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.538
- WE COULDN'T IDENTIFY
ONE OF THE TROPHIES.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.873
IT WAS A HANDKERCHIEF.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.609
MY MOTHER
ALWAYS CARRIED ONE.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.045
[whispers]
WHAT IF IT'S HERS?

25:13.079 --> 25:15.014
- I WISH THAT YOU'D COME
AND TALKED TO ME

25:15.047 --> 25:16.148
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.551
- I'M NOT IMAGINING
THESE DETAILS.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.319
- MAYBE SO, BUT YOU'RE
ASSOCIATING THEM IN WAYS

25:20.352 --> 25:22.555
THAT AREN'T RATIONAL.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.194
WHY DID YOU TELL VIVIAN
ABOUT HER MOTHER?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.630
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.099
SHE DEMANDED TO KNOW
WHY I WAS THERE.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.234
- NOBODY FORCED YOU TO TELL HER.
- SHE HAD TO KNOW.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.871
- OR DID YOU DO IT
FOR YOURSELF?

25:56.989 --> 25:59.792
- LIV, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.761
- YES, IT IS.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.630
LOOK AT VIVIAN

26:03.663 --> 26:06.265
AND THEN AT MY FATHER.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.900
THERE'S A PHYSICAL
RESEMBLANCE.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.102
MY FATHER WAS A JUNKIE...

26:10.136 --> 26:13.606
AND VIVIAN
GREW UP TO BE ONE TOO.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.174
- YOU GREW UP TO BE A COP.
SO?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.677
- I COULD GET OUR DNA
TESTED.

26:20.046 --> 26:20.913
I WENT BACK TO VIVIAN'S

26:20.947 --> 26:25.017
AND I GRABBED THIS
OUT OF HER GARBAGE.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.053
- LIV, THERE'S NO WAY
JASON GAMBEL

26:27.086 --> 26:29.255
CROSSED PATHS
WITH YOUR OLD MAN.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.358
HE DIED 15 YEARS AGO.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.966
- OKAY.
SO MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:39.999 --> 26:44.003
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY
ELSE GAVE GAMBEL THOSE TROPHIES.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.172
BUT WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?

26:54.080 --> 26:58.117
- GAMBEL IS SCARED TO DEATH
OF GOING BACK TO PRISON.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.119
WHY?

27:01.754 --> 27:05.792
- HIS LAST CELLMATE.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.326
- WALTER BURLOCK
WAS GAMBEL'S CELLIE

27:07.359 --> 27:09.061
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS
OF HIS BID.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.363
- HE'S GOT MULTIPLE RAPES AND
ASSAULT CHARGES ON HIS SHEET.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.965
HE GOT OUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.867
- WHERE IS HE NOW?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.203
HE NEVER CHECKED IN WITH
HIS P.O. AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.105
HE NEVER REGISTERED
AS A SEX OFFENDER.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.707
- LAST KNOWN ADDRESS?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.441
- BUILDING TORN DOWN
IN THE SEVENTIES.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.343
- ANY LIVING RELATIVES?
- NONE I COULD FIND.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.679
NO CREDIT CARDS.
NO SIGN OF HIM.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.715
- THEN WHERE'S HE BEEN LIVING,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.717
AND HOW'S HE BEEN
SUPPORTING HIMSELF?

27:30.750 --> 27:33.886
- GAMBEL. BEING BURLOCK'S
BITCH DIDN'T END IN PRISON.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.822
- MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY GAMBEL
FREAKED OUT ON HIS P.O.

27:35.855 --> 27:36.989
TWO WEEKS AGO.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.058
BURLOCK PAID HIM A VISIT,
STOLE HIS CAR.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.061
FIN, PULL GAMBEL'S FINANCIALS.

27:44.396 --> 27:48.167
- WALTER BURLOCK?
YEAH, HE'S RUNNIN' A TAB.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.904
- HE'S USING GAMBEL'S
CREDIT CARD.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.105
- WHERE IS HE?
- HE'S OVER THERE.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.842
GETTIN' A LAP DANCE
FROM TANYA.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.217
- [snaps]

28:05.251 --> 28:07.053
HEY.

28:07.086 --> 28:11.090
- HEY, I ALREADY PAID YOU.
GET BACK HERE, BITCH.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.359
OH!

28:13.392 --> 28:15.127
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

28:15.161 --> 28:17.129
GET OFF MY BACK!

28:17.163 --> 28:18.798
- YOU LIKE BRACELETS
AS TROPHIES?

28:18.831 --> 28:20.366
[clicking]

28:20.399 --> 28:22.068
TRY THESE.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.010
[door opens]

28:31.043 --> 28:32.511
- I THINK YOU SET
A RECORD, BURLOCK.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.747
WE'RE GOOD.

28:34.781 --> 28:37.750
HMM?
TWO WEEKS OUT OF PRISON,

28:37.784 --> 28:40.286
AND YOU'RE GOING RIGHT BACK?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.822
FOR KIDNAPPING,
RAPE, AND MURDER.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.926
- [chuckles]

28:46.959 --> 28:48.494
YOU GOT A...

28:48.527 --> 28:51.430
REALLY NICE TIGHT
WHITE ASS, HONEY.

28:51.463 --> 28:55.001
EITHER COME OVER HERE
AND FINISH MY LAP DANCE

28:55.034 --> 28:56.903
OR GET ME A LAWYER.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.105
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED ONE.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.841
GAMBEL GAVE US
YOUR BOX OF TROPHIES.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.844
AND YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE
ALL OVER HIS BLOODY BASEMENT.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.914
- I BEEN LOCKED IN A CAGE
FOR 30 YEARS, HON.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.316
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT!

29:10.349 --> 29:12.318
- WELL, YOUR LITTLE BUDDY IS
RIGHT NEXT DOOR

29:12.351 --> 29:14.320
TELLING US EVERYTHING
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.189
NOW, A CAREER CRIMINAL
LIKE YOU KNOWS

29:17.223 --> 29:20.426
THAT WHOEVER TALKS FIRST
GETS THE DEAL.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.828
- LAWYER.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.830
NOW, BITCH!

29:25.231 --> 29:28.334
- MY CLIENT'S READY
TO TALK FOR A DEAL.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.837
- MAYBE I DON'T NEED HIM NOW.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.304
- THEN WHY CALL THIS MEETING?

29:32.338 --> 29:33.806
- SORRY TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.843
SEE YOU AT TRIAL.
- YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.344
YOU DON'T HAVE THE MAN

29:38.377 --> 29:41.347
WHO ACTUALLY RAPED
AND MURDERED SAMANTHA MILLERTON.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.949
- THE TIME TO COOPERATE

29:42.982 --> 29:46.819
WAS BEFORE WE GOT GAMBEL'S
COCONSPIRATOR.

29:46.853 --> 29:47.820
- COME ON.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.355
GET UP.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.422
COME HERE.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.895
HAVE A LOOK.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.032
- DON'T TELL BURLOCK I'M HERE!

30:00.066 --> 30:02.234
PLEASE! HE CAN'T KNOW!
- OKAY.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.036
AGREE TO A DEAL AND PROTECTION

30:04.070 --> 30:06.973
IN EXCHANGE FOR JASON GAMBEL'S
ADMISSION AND TESTIMONY

30:07.006 --> 30:08.440
AGAINST WALTER BURLOCK.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.310
- I DON'T NEED MR. GAMBEL'S
TESTIMONY, DO I, DETECTIVE?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.045
- NO. BECAUSE WE KNOW
YOU DUMPED HER BODY,

30:13.079 --> 30:14.513
AND I KNOW YOU TOOK
A SHOT AT ME!

30:14.546 --> 30:15.948
NOW I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

30:15.982 --> 30:17.616
THAT YOU AND BURLOCK SHARE
A NICE, TIGHT CELL

30:17.649 --> 30:19.385
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.520
- I DIDN'T SHOOT AT YOU.
BURLOCK DID.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.355
HE RAPED THAT GIRL, NOT ME.
I WAS THERE.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.324
SHE WAS SCREAMING.
AND THEN HE CUT HER AND I--

30:25.357 --> 30:27.526
- QUIET.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.229
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
- ACTING IN CONCERT

30:30.262 --> 30:31.430
STILL PUTS YOUR CLIENT
ON THE HOOK

30:31.463 --> 30:33.866
FOR ANYTHING HE CLAIMS
WALTER BURLOCK DID ON HIS OWN.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.935
- UNDER EXTREME DURESS.
JASON GAMBEL WAS TERRIFIED

30:35.968 --> 30:37.336
THAT HE'D BE KILLED
BY THAT MONSTER

30:37.369 --> 30:39.972
IF HE DIDN'T FOLLOW ORDERS.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.341
PRISON INFIRMARY RECORDS
DETAILING HIS INJURIES.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.211
ANAL TEARING, INTERNAL BLEEDING,
FRACTURED BONES.

30:45.244 --> 30:49.048
BURLOCK CONDITIONED GAMBEL
TO OBEY HIM

30:49.081 --> 30:52.018
BY SODOMIZING
AND BEATING HIM REPEATEDLY

30:52.051 --> 30:53.385
FOR FIVE LONG YEARS.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.587
ONCE HE GOT OUT,
BURLOCK TRACKED GAMBEL DOWN...

30:55.621 --> 30:59.391
TOOK OVER HIS LIFE,
HIS BANK ACCOUNTS,

30:59.425 --> 31:03.229
MOVED INTO HIS BASEMENT.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.264
- INTERVIEW'S OVER.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.401
- JASON GAMBEL'S A VICTIM,
COUNSELOR.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.437
- NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAW.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.607
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

31:15.641 --> 31:18.277
- A LOOPHOLE BIG ENOUGH FOR
WALTER BURLOCK TO SKIP THROUGH.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.111
- WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

31:19.145 --> 31:21.380
TO PUT HIM AWAY
FOR THREE LIFETIMES.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.514
- TOO BAD WE CAN'T USE IT.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.417
I HAVE TO VOID BURLOCK'S ARREST
AND DEFER PROSECUTION.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.919
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOU UNKNOWINGLY

31:26.953 --> 31:28.387
CONDUCTED AN ILLEGAL SEARCH.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.222
- NO, WE DIDN'T.
WE WERE SHOT AT.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.391
WE HAD CAUSE TO ENTER
AND SEARCH THAT PREMISES.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.692
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.494
ONCE BURLOCK MOVED INTO
GAMBEL'S RESIDENCE,

31:35.527 --> 31:38.130
HE HAD A REASONABLE
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.966
WE HAD TO SERVE THEM BOTH
WITH A WARRANT.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.369
- GILLIAN,
IF WE LET BURLOCK GO,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.938
HE'S GONNA RAPE AND KILL
AGAIN.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.174
- UNTIL YOU BRING ME
NEW EVIDENCE, HE WALKS.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.442
- OKAY, LOOK, WE CAN LOCK HIM UP
FOR VIOLATING HIS PAROLE.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.978
HE'S A LEVEL ONE
SEX OFFENDER.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.612
- HE'S GOTTA DO IT
WITHIN TWO MONTHS.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.214
HE'S ONLY BEEN OUT TWO WEEKS.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.083
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO?

31:57.116 --> 32:00.052
- MAKE HIM CONFESS
OR CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.920
- OH, DETECTIVE BENSON--

32:03.389 --> 32:04.556
- I'LL TAKE THE KID
TO THE BREAK ROOM.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.359
- HIS NAME'S CALVIN.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.095
- HEY, VIV?
- HMM?

32:09.128 --> 32:10.429
- VIV.
- HOW YOU DOING?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.664
WANNA GRAB A SNACK WITH ME?
- SURE.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.601
- OKAY. NOTHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOUR MOM.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.237
- VIVIAN,
HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.274
VIVIAN, YOUR SON
IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

32:22.308 --> 32:24.143
AND I CAN'T SAY
THAT I BLAME HIM.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.712
- I'M FINE.
- HEY. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

32:28.680 --> 32:33.085
- I, UH, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE MY BLOOD FOR DNA,

32:33.119 --> 32:35.154
'CAUSE I NEED TO FIND
MY REAL FATHER.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.363
- VIVIAN...

32:44.396 --> 32:48.367
KNOWING WHO RAPED YOUR MOTHER
ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.003
- KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.638
- REALLY?

32:52.671 --> 32:55.341
YOU FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE A CHILD OF RAPE,

32:55.374 --> 32:57.409
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE HIGH

32:57.443 --> 32:59.511
AND IN A PRECINCT FULL OF COPS.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.247
- ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.316
- THE BEST THING
THAT I CAN DO TO HELP YOU

33:04.350 --> 33:07.253
IS TO FIND YOU A REHAB
AND A SHRINK.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.421
- DON'T JUDGE ME.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.423
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
KNOW WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.093
- THAT'S WHY I GOT HELP
BEFORE IT DESTROYED ME.

33:15.394 --> 33:19.031
- DOES IT EVER GET BETTER?
- WITH TIME.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.367
AND LOTS OF COUNSELING.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.269
- MAYBE THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANT.

33:23.302 --> 33:27.306
I-I NEED THIS RAGE.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.043
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT CONNECTS ME TO MY PAST.

33:33.279 --> 33:34.246
- YOUR MOTHER?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.715
- SHE DIED LAST NIGHT.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.451
- I'M SORRY.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.454
- I THOUGHT I--
THOUGHT I WOULD BE OKAY.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.424
SHE DIDN'T REALLY
LOVE ME ANYWAY.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.227
- SHE KEPT YOU.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

33:48.260 --> 33:51.263
VIVIAN, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT

33:51.297 --> 33:54.266
TO BE ANGRY AND BE RESENTFUL.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.436
BUT IF YOU LET THIS
CONSUME YOU--

33:57.469 --> 33:59.371
HOW IS THAT GONNA
AFFECT YOUR SON?

33:59.405 --> 34:01.307
- CALVIN DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.841
- CAN HE STAY WITH HIS FATHER

34:02.874 --> 34:05.411
UNTIL YOU...
GET BACK ON YOUR FEET?

34:05.444 --> 34:07.579
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

34:07.613 --> 34:11.383
THE CREEP HASN'T SHOWN HIS FACE
SINCE CALVIN WAS BORN.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.489
I DON'T WANT HIM HURT.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.760
I LOVE MY BOY.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.729
- YOU LOVE YOUR BOY?

34:25.631 --> 34:28.100
THEN GET...HELP.

34:32.404 --> 34:36.408
THERE'S SOME EXCELLENT
COUNSELORS ON THIS LIST.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.376
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY

34:37.409 --> 34:39.411
EXCEPT I'M SORRY
I SHOWED UP HERE LIKE THIS.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.381
- MOM. CAN WE GO?
- I GUESS THAT'S MY CUE.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.750
- HEY, CALL ONE OF THEM, VIVIAN.
I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU, OKAY?

34:44.783 --> 34:47.286
- I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
- THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK FOR.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.288
- MOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.522
THANKS A LOT.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.325
[cell phone rings]
HELLO.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.861
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

34:55.894 --> 34:58.164
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.699
- KID LEFT HIS BACKPACK.
- OH.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.136
THANKS.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.537
- NEVER TRUST A COP.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.673
THEY'LL BLAME STUFF ON YA
JUST FOR FUN.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.209
- CALVIN.
GO BACK TO YOUR MOTHER.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.710
- JUST EXPLAINING
THE FACTS OF LIFE.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.479
- GET ON THAT ELEVATOR,
AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.147
- I CAN CATCH THE NEXT ONE.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.783
DETECTIVE BENSON
THOUGHT SHE HAD ME,

35:17.816 --> 35:20.352
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
SHE FELL WAY SHORT.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.221
- IT'S THE FUNERAL PARLOR.

35:22.254 --> 35:23.222
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.624
THEY HAVE ME ON HOLD.
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.793
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE THINKS THAT I RAPED

35:27.826 --> 35:29.428
AND MURDERED A WOMAN--
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.163
- I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER

35:31.197 --> 35:33.732
THAT OLD RINGS AND BRACELETS
DOESN'T PROVE GUILT.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.302
- BURLOCK. LEAVE NOW.
- I GUESS SHE

35:36.335 --> 35:37.636
JUST DIDN'T DO HER JOB
THAT DAY.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.805
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.340
- VIVIAN, GO BACK
TO THE SQUAD ROOM NOW.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.774
- WALTER BURLOCK.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.410
MALIGNED, MISUNDERSTOOD,

35:44.443 --> 35:47.213
AND MISTAKEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.414
- YOU'RE THE RAPIST.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.915
- NOT SO.

35:49.948 --> 35:53.452
LOOK, NOW SHE'S AFRAID OF ME,
AREN'T YOU, SWEETMEAT?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.587
- DO I LOOK SCARED OF YOU,
PRICK?

35:55.621 --> 35:57.289
- VIVIAN, CALM DOWN!
- DO I?

35:57.323 --> 36:00.659
- DO I LOOK SCARED?
- VIVIAN, STOP IT.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.628
- OOH, I LIKE FEISTY.
ALWAYS HAVE.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.363
- GO GRAB YOUR SON AND LEAVE!

36:04.396 --> 36:07.333
- DID--DID YOU RAPE JOAN ARLISS?
- WHO?

36:07.366 --> 36:08.667
- LEAVE!
- JOAN ARLISS!

36:08.700 --> 36:09.835
- IT'S BEEN PLEASANT.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.338
I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
REAL SOON.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.872
BYE, SONNY.
- CALM DOWN. OKAY?

36:13.905 --> 36:18.477
- THAT'S THE MAN THAT RAPED
MY MOM, ISN'T IT?

36:18.510 --> 36:19.978
ISN'T IT?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.781
- YES.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.353
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.688
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT...

36:29.721 --> 36:34.226
THAT BOTH OF OUR MOTHERS
WERE RAPED BY THE SAME MAN.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.894
- ARE YOU MY SISTER?

36:35.927 --> 36:38.864
- NO.
I RAN YOUR DNA AGAINST MINE.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.400
BUT, VIVIAN,
I'M STILL HERE FOR YOU.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.235
- COME ON.
GO TO HELL!

36:43.269 --> 36:45.404
GO TO HELL.
COME ON.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.572
- CALVIN.

37:00.286 --> 37:02.921
- UNI SAID BURLOCK WENT IN
AT 5:00 P.M. YESTERDAY.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.424
HASN'T LEFT SINCE.

37:05.457 --> 37:08.260
- FIN'S GOT EYES ON GAMBEL
AT A LOCAL HOTEL.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.963
- KICKING A GUY
OUT OF HIS OWN HOUSE?

37:11.997 --> 37:15.667
SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE HOLD
BURLOCK HAS OVER HIM.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.836
Fin: GAMBEL'S ON HIS WAY
BACK HOME.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.372
COMING AROUND THE CORNER.
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.773
EITHER BURLOCK
ORDERED HIM HERE

37:21.807 --> 37:23.309
OR GAMBEL SUDDENLY
GREW A PAIR.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.777
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.456
- YOU THINK BURLOCK
CALLED GAMBEL

37:37.489 --> 37:39.291
TO GO ON THE PROWL AGAIN?

37:39.325 --> 37:41.660
- WELL, WHEN YOU GET THE ITCH,
YOU CALL YOUR BITCH.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.598
- WELL, I HOPE
THEY LEAVE SOON.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.635
I CAN'T WAIT
TO PUT BURLOCK AWAY.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.979
- GAMBEL, DON'T MOVE.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.381
DON'T MOVE.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.754
- HE'S DEAD.
THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.022
- WELL, THANKS
FOR HELPING US OUT.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.327
- ARREST HIM FOR THE MURDER
OF WALTER BURLOCK.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.862
- LOOKS LIKE
YOU WHACKED HIM GOOD.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.734
- BLOOD SPATTER LOOKS LIKE
GAMBEL BLITZED HIM.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.905
- DEFINITELY HIT HIM WITH
THE CAST IRON MORE THAN ONCE.

38:26.938 --> 38:30.909
LOT OF RAGE.
- GAMBEL FITS THAT DESCRIPTION.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.581
- WHO YOU TRYING TO KID, LIV?
LOOK AT THE BLOOD.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.683
IT'S CONGEALED,
BEGINNING TO CRUST.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.485
THAT BODY HAS BEEN THERE
FOR HOURS.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.554
- NO. VIVIAN
COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.089
HER FIRST PRIORITY IS CALVIN.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.925
- DOESN'T MEAN SHE COULDN'T
HAVE COME OVER HERE LAST NIGHT.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.561
- GAMBEL COULD HAVE
LEFT HIS HOTEL UNNOTICED,

38:49.595 --> 38:50.696
COME BACK HERE, KILLED HIM,

38:50.729 --> 38:52.898
AND THEN COME BACK HERE TODAY
TO DISCOVER THE BODY.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.066
- OR VIVIAN FOLLOWED
BURLOCK HOME,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.201
BATTED HER EYELASHES,

38:56.234 --> 38:59.471
AND THEN BATTED HIM WITH
THE FIRST THING THAT SHE SAW...

38:59.505 --> 39:01.373
A PAN ON THE STOVE.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.447
[doorbell chiming]

39:10.916 --> 39:12.150
- I'M LOOKING FOR
VIVIAN ARLISS.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.086
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- UH, TO TALK TO HER.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.154
IS SHE HOME?
- NO.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.556
- AND YOU ARE...

39:17.589 --> 39:18.890
- I'M SARAH HOYT,
FRIEND OF VIV'S.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.058
I'VE BEEN HELPING HER OUT.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.661
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT
OR WHEN SHE'S COMING BACK.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.497
- PLEASE HAVE HER CALL
DETECTIVE BENSON IMMEDIATELY.

39:25.531 --> 39:26.765
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.406
- LET ME GUESS.
VIVIAN WASN'T HOME.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.041
- WHY, DID SHE CALL?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.944
- NO. AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

39:41.713 --> 39:44.182
- GOT HERE ABOUT
AN HOUR AGO.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.786
THE ONLY THING HE'LL SAY IS
HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO GIVE YOU.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.792
- WHAT'S GOING ON, CALVIN?

39:55.461 --> 39:59.164
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:59.197 --> 40:01.767
- MY MOM'S GONE.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.171
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WENT?

40:06.204 --> 40:08.607
- NO.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.176
- SO HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

40:11.209 --> 40:13.445
- MY MOM DROVE ME.

40:14.980 --> 40:18.216
SHE TOLD ME TO RUN IN
AND GIVE THIS TO YOU.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.952
AND WHEN YOU WEREN'T HERE,
I WENT OUT TO TELL HER,

40:20.986 --> 40:23.054
AND SHE WAS GONE.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.860
HOW COULD SHE LEAVE ME HERE?

40:28.894 --> 40:31.797
