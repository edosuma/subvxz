WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.801
Previously on "Black Lightning"...

00:01.802 --> 00:04.422
The Markovians are on
the outskirts of Freeland,

00:04.425 --> 00:06.803
and they're marshaling their forces.

00:06.806 --> 00:10.959
The Markovians want to capture
or kill as many metas as possible.

00:10.962 --> 00:12.086
What do you want me to do?

00:12.088 --> 00:14.463
Your target is the data farm up ahead.

00:14.465 --> 00:16.081
- I found it.
- Now take it out.

00:19.846 --> 00:21.189
The One Hundred,

00:21.192 --> 00:23.097
the warrior class of Freeland,

00:23.099 --> 00:25.049
and y'all out here fighting over crumbs?

00:25.051 --> 00:26.980
Patient 49 is here for his blood test.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.345
Thank you, Nurse Allen.

00:28.348 --> 00:31.106
You need my antibodies to
stabilize the metas, don't you?

00:31.109 --> 00:34.484
If the metas aren't stabilized, then
the ASA can't weaponize them.

00:34.487 --> 00:35.651
I'm your golden goose.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.942
Come on, quickly. Get in.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.533
- No! My bag!
- Leave it, leave it.

00:45.536 --> 00:47.277
- Gambi, I need my bag!
- There's no time.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.742
It's time to figure out
who hired Gambi's killer.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.668
While you can die,

01:02.671 --> 01:05.922
you can always be brought
back to life again.

01:05.925 --> 01:07.340
I'm not working with you anymore.

01:07.343 --> 01:08.509
You don't have a choice.

01:08.512 --> 01:09.659
Wrong answer.

01:10.855 --> 01:11.988
That's a hologram.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.686
This isn't over, young lady.

01:26.537 --> 01:31.240
First Sergeant Gardner Grayle,
currently attached to the ASA.

01:31.242 --> 01:35.378
From a small town in Kentucky,
just outside Louisville.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.665
I was so excited when the
ASA first recruited me

01:37.668 --> 01:39.790
from the 75th Ranger Regiment.

01:39.792 --> 01:43.719
This was my chance to serve my
country at the highest level.

01:43.721 --> 01:45.313
At least, that's what they told me.

01:53.303 --> 01:55.564
And hell, I don't know
what to believe anymore,

01:55.566 --> 01:57.400
but one thing's for certain.

01:57.402 --> 02:00.903
Killing innocent kids is
not what I signed up for.

02:00.905 --> 02:03.373
I took an oath to
defend our Constitution.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.983
If anything happens to me,

02:06.986 --> 02:09.078
here's what you need to know.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.590
Under direct orders from Agent Odell...

02:28.358 --> 02:29.432
Dad.

02:29.434 --> 02:31.100
I came as fast as I could. You okay?

02:31.102 --> 02:32.542
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

02:33.803 --> 02:35.529
Oh, that's Brandon.

02:35.532 --> 02:37.752
- The ASA tried to kidnap us.
- Hey.

02:38.351 --> 02:39.650
What?

02:39.652 --> 02:41.066
Look, I know Odell was behind it,

02:41.069 --> 02:43.429
so I called him and when he
showed up, I tried to blast him.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.780
But it was just a hologram.

02:44.782 --> 02:46.237
You called him how?

02:48.527 --> 02:49.629
One second.

02:56.368 --> 02:57.735
All right. So...

02:57.738 --> 02:59.387
You already know Odell gave me a suit,

02:59.389 --> 03:00.930
but there's way more to it than that.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.430
Okay.

03:05.428 --> 03:07.303
All right, don't be mad...

03:07.305 --> 03:09.213
but Odell gave me a
cell phone to call him

03:09.215 --> 03:10.535
when you and Mom were in the Pit.

03:11.572 --> 03:12.995
Yeah, okay.

03:12.998 --> 03:14.438
I know I should've told you,

03:14.439 --> 03:16.178
but he was showing me
all sorts of bad stuff

03:16.180 --> 03:17.613
about Markovia.

03:17.616 --> 03:19.456
And he was also telling
me that you were wrong,

03:19.457 --> 03:21.171
and you'd never agree to it. So...

03:22.610 --> 03:25.192
So, I've been helping
him fight the Markovians.

03:25.861 --> 03:27.564
Wait. What do you mean, "helping him"?

03:27.566 --> 03:28.824
Helping him how?

03:28.826 --> 03:30.626
I mean, I've been going
on missions for Odell.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.386
What kind of missions?

03:33.389 --> 03:35.498
Well, I lit up the dudes
that beat you down.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.554
You gotta admit they had that coming.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.845
And?

03:42.839 --> 03:44.413
Um...

03:44.416 --> 03:47.459
I kind of located a
Markovian data center,

03:47.461 --> 03:48.978
where they were doing cyber warfare.

03:49.722 --> 03:50.893
I blew it up.

03:52.016 --> 03:53.522
You did what?

03:54.852 --> 03:56.819
Jen, you could have killed somebody.

03:58.022 --> 03:59.377
I think I did.

04:00.266 --> 04:01.857
Oh, no, baby girl.

04:01.859 --> 04:03.826
Look, I saw in that other reality,

04:03.828 --> 04:05.107
how the road I was on

04:05.110 --> 04:07.250
was just leading me to a
person that I never wanna be.

04:07.253 --> 04:08.803
I know that, Dad. I got played.

04:09.942 --> 04:12.985
But you and Mom never
let me use my powers.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.165
So, you feel like this is our fault?

04:15.168 --> 04:16.668
No.

04:16.672 --> 04:17.930
I don't.

04:17.933 --> 04:21.130
But they're growing every
day, and it's painful.

04:22.639 --> 04:23.855
I love you and Mom,

04:23.858 --> 04:25.578
but you made me feel
like some sort of freak

04:25.580 --> 04:27.100
that had to be locked up all the time.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.457
And Odell,

04:28.460 --> 04:30.163
he made me feel special.

04:30.166 --> 04:32.128
I know this sounds crazy,

04:32.131 --> 04:34.673
but he set me free in ways I
never could've imagined, Dad.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.724
He took me to space.

04:35.726 --> 04:36.751
I've been to...

04:36.753 --> 04:38.299
I've been to space.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.045
Jen...

04:43.048 --> 04:44.200
I love you.

04:45.444 --> 04:47.662
Everything your mother and I do for you

04:47.664 --> 04:49.550
is because we love you.

04:49.553 --> 04:50.665
I know.

04:51.909 --> 04:53.603
I'm really sorry.

04:53.606 --> 04:55.531
Trust me, I learned my lesson.

04:56.913 --> 04:59.030
But despite how you may feel about it,

04:59.033 --> 05:00.216
Odell needs to die.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.398
He needs to be dealt with.

05:04.514 --> 05:07.256
That doesn't mean killing him.

05:07.258 --> 05:10.509
I'll come back and get you when
I figure out how to get to him.

05:11.552 --> 05:12.989
All right.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.715
So, Brendan...

05:16.717 --> 05:18.150
Uh, actually, it's Brandon.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.435
Yeah, whatever.

05:19.437 --> 05:21.270
Stay away from my daughter. Understand?

05:21.272 --> 05:23.680
Dad, I told you, we're just friends.

05:23.682 --> 05:25.766
Your mother and I
were just friends, too.

05:28.985 --> 05:30.220
Brandon.

05:31.282 --> 05:32.832
You know what a eunuch is?

05:32.834 --> 05:34.332
Yes, sir.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.664
Keep that in mind.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.348
Now, that's a scary dude.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.300
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

05:51.302 --> 05:52.531
Mmm...

05:53.304 --> 05:55.137
Oh, my God, I've missed you so much.

05:55.139 --> 05:57.576
Then take me back with you.

05:58.476 --> 05:59.808
What about your shifting?

05:59.810 --> 06:01.678
It's under control now.

06:01.681 --> 06:04.232
The party healers are fantastic.

06:04.235 --> 06:06.452
Plus, seeing you with
your dad made me realize...

06:07.318 --> 06:10.202
my problem is with abandonment.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.488
And that's why my
emotions would flare up

06:12.490 --> 06:14.290
and I couldn't control my shifting.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.656
But now...

06:17.495 --> 06:19.503
I know I'm not alone anymore.

06:20.739 --> 06:22.864
You found my cure.

06:22.867 --> 06:25.700
It's my connection to you.

06:29.978 --> 06:31.236
I'm sorry.

06:31.239 --> 06:33.709
My dad has been blowing
me up. I gotta go.

06:33.712 --> 06:35.457
We gotta go.

06:41.844 --> 06:43.611
Are you okay? You look terrible.

06:44.614 --> 06:46.471
Thank you, Peter.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.856
No, I didn't mean it like that.

06:47.858 --> 06:50.250
I mean, you look a little sick.

06:50.253 --> 06:52.119
It's just, uh, a flu.

06:53.698 --> 06:54.928
Why are you here?

06:57.484 --> 07:00.861
I need a dose of the
metastablization cure.

07:00.863 --> 07:03.155
You know I only have a
limited number of vials left...

07:03.157 --> 07:06.542
And you can't make more
without Tobias. Yes, I know.

07:06.544 --> 07:09.970
I also know that you do what you
do because those kids in the Pit...

07:09.972 --> 07:12.002
are counting on you to keep them alive.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.579
I have someone counting
on me to do the same now.

07:17.296 --> 07:18.565
What do you mean?

07:19.798 --> 07:22.180
One of the original meta-kids,

07:22.183 --> 07:23.800
he's in the Sanctum.

07:23.802 --> 07:25.152
A 30-year pod kid?

07:26.230 --> 07:28.153
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.953
Because I'm the one who put him there.

07:32.737 --> 07:34.596
I thought I was doing the right thing.

07:35.444 --> 07:37.239
Keeping the world safe for liberty,

07:37.241 --> 07:39.575
you know, the whole
thing, but the reality was,

07:39.577 --> 07:42.360
I was pointing out
children for abduction.

07:42.362 --> 07:45.221
And when the meta-human
experiment started killing them...

07:45.224 --> 07:46.882
It was why I quit.

07:48.327 --> 07:51.607
I did everything I could
to protect Jefferson.

07:51.610 --> 07:53.689
Raised him as if he was my own son.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.613
But I know it doesn't make
up for all the lives I took,

07:57.616 --> 07:58.894
from so many kids.

08:00.255 --> 08:02.055
And I'm asking you, Lynn, just please...

08:03.217 --> 08:04.914
help me give one back.

08:08.037 --> 08:10.213
How could I refuse?

08:14.412 --> 08:16.353
I need something from you first.

08:16.355 --> 08:17.477
Name it.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.835
You have remote access to
the AC system in the Sanctum.

08:20.838 --> 08:23.359
I need it to check on
the kids in the Pit.

08:23.362 --> 08:24.953
You don't wanna get caught with...

08:24.955 --> 08:27.488
I'm not asking this
lightly. I know the risks.

08:29.627 --> 08:30.871
All right.

08:35.029 --> 08:36.442
Thank you.

08:37.876 --> 08:39.707
Do you love travel, Major?

08:40.471 --> 08:42.480
Is that why you joined the ASA?

08:43.775 --> 08:45.549
Because I don't.

08:45.551 --> 08:47.092
I'd rather be home.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.186
A place specifically designed by me...

08:50.189 --> 08:51.489
for me.

08:52.492 --> 08:53.932
But I can't be home,

08:53.934 --> 08:57.319
because if I dare go back to Gotham,

08:57.321 --> 09:01.263
everything goes to hell.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.900
We've had a few setbacks, sir.

09:03.902 --> 09:06.306
- It's nothing that we can't...
- "Setbacks"?

09:08.407 --> 09:12.668
You lost a quarter of the
city to the Resistance.

09:12.670 --> 09:16.454
The Resistance took down
our detainment facility.

09:16.456 --> 09:20.668
And you failed with
Jennifer Pierce so badly

09:20.671 --> 09:23.512
that she likely turned against us.

09:23.514 --> 09:26.106
"Setbacks".

09:26.115 --> 09:28.866
These are not setbacks.
They're disasters.

09:30.521 --> 09:33.272
Might I suggest a new
plan of action, sir?

09:33.274 --> 09:34.551
By all means.

09:34.554 --> 09:38.097
Chip and stabilize the metas
we have here in the Pit.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.605
Do we still have supplies
of the stabilization cure?

09:41.607 --> 09:43.106
Negative.

09:43.108 --> 09:46.126
But Dr. Blair's standing
by to make more.

09:46.128 --> 09:49.113
All we need is more bone
marrow from Tobias Whale.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.949
Request permission to move
him to the medical ward.

09:53.952 --> 09:57.662
Chip and stabilize the
metas, rinse and repeat.

09:58.624 --> 10:00.516
Your plan...

10:02.836 --> 10:04.231
is approved.

10:06.671 --> 10:08.292
Sergeant Grayle.

10:08.295 --> 10:09.674
Thanks for coming.

10:10.302 --> 10:11.708
Come in.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.987
No problem.

10:20.371 --> 10:21.744
Are you okay?

10:23.332 --> 10:25.023
I'm fine.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.525
I don't know how you messaged
me through the ASA system

10:27.527 --> 10:28.616
and I don't wanna know.

10:28.619 --> 10:31.197
I saw you in the security
footage picking up the bag.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.995
You didn't log it in.

10:32.998 --> 10:35.491
Because I needed to decide
whether to find you and return it.

10:35.494 --> 10:38.161
Or you knew you were being watched
and you were trying to play me.

10:38.163 --> 10:39.405
With all due respect,

10:39.407 --> 10:42.707
I don't play when it
comes to innocent lives.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.730
Now, you have every
right not to trust me...

10:44.732 --> 10:45.804
Exactly.

10:59.828 --> 11:01.146
Thank you.

11:02.780 --> 11:03.940
Everything is there.

11:05.115 --> 11:06.856
But I was tempted to go through and see

11:06.858 --> 11:08.983
if there were any
stabilization cures in there.

11:09.987 --> 11:11.787
Dr. Blair attempted to re-create it

11:11.789 --> 11:13.905
and killed three kids in the process.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.007
Oh, my God.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.292
I have to stop them.

11:18.295 --> 11:20.704
Security in the Pit is
beyond cutting-edge.

11:20.706 --> 11:23.390
There is no way in hell
to extract those kids.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.764
Yeah, but they need Tobias for the cure.

11:25.767 --> 11:26.876
I'll get him out.

11:26.878 --> 11:28.187
Dr. Stewart, Tobias Whale...

11:28.189 --> 11:30.426
Is extremely dangerous. Yes, I know.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.425
Listen, you could be
prosecuted for treason.

11:33.427 --> 11:36.146
I'll conceal your involvement.

11:36.149 --> 11:37.237
Don't worry about me.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.295
Sounds like you have a plan.

11:40.852 --> 11:42.201
I do.

11:43.124 --> 11:44.425
I'm with you.

11:46.509 --> 11:47.922
Excellent.

11:49.715 --> 11:51.519
Would you excuse me for a moment?

12:06.326 --> 12:11.354
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

12:16.273 --> 12:17.766
That's a lot of boxes.

12:19.443 --> 12:21.327
You ain't had no trouble with the ASA?

12:21.329 --> 12:24.237
Yo, man, after everything they
did to me while I was in there...

12:24.239 --> 12:26.632
Every chance I get to pop
an ASA joke, I'm taking it.

12:27.501 --> 12:29.242
That's what's up.

12:29.244 --> 12:32.954
But be careful mixing personal
with business, Devonte.

12:32.956 --> 12:35.371
That's the fastest way you
end up getting caught slipping.

12:36.752 --> 12:39.169
I'm born and bred in Freeland.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.005
And these streets...

12:41.008 --> 12:43.316
These streets are my heart,
and so are the people.

12:44.518 --> 12:46.635
That's personal.

12:46.637 --> 12:49.655
But you wanna know why I sell guns
to the Resistance double the price?

12:49.657 --> 12:51.932
- Business.
- That's right.

12:51.934 --> 12:54.785
You've been moving up since
you got out of the ASA jail.

12:54.787 --> 12:56.103
I need you to stay focused.

12:56.105 --> 12:57.200
I'm focused.

12:57.203 --> 12:59.603
I even found a hacker for that
briefcase just like you asked.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.447
Yeah, I need you to hit pause on that,

13:01.450 --> 13:04.569
until we know for sure that
Tobias is still in Freeland.

13:04.571 --> 13:07.287
'Cause ain't nobody seen his albino ass.

13:07.290 --> 13:08.924
We got other business to handle.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.380
Streets have been talking.

13:11.383 --> 13:13.712
Somebody else set up
shop on the East Side.

13:13.714 --> 13:15.122
Making bank...

13:15.124 --> 13:17.613
and they ain't offered me
a penny for protection.

13:17.616 --> 13:19.977
They ain't paid their tithes.

13:19.979 --> 13:21.937
I need you to find out what's what.

13:21.939 --> 13:23.606
I got you.

13:24.508 --> 13:25.799
That's what's up.

13:25.801 --> 13:27.983
My entire body hurts.

13:29.063 --> 13:30.529
I've got just what you need.

13:35.349 --> 13:36.702
It's not gonna hurt.

13:41.409 --> 13:42.855
That feels weird.

13:48.449 --> 13:49.830
Better?

13:49.833 --> 13:51.056
Better.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.688
Why are you doing all of this for me?

14:00.761 --> 14:02.669
Most white people
would've seen me and...

14:02.671 --> 14:04.772
had a problem, and called the ASA.

14:06.350 --> 14:08.717
We all need someone sometime.

14:08.719 --> 14:10.602
Nobody gets through this life alone.

14:10.604 --> 14:12.405
Right now, I'm just a
guy who could help you.

14:13.607 --> 14:14.607
Besides...

14:15.517 --> 14:17.443
you remind me of someone.

14:17.445 --> 14:19.517
Now, why don't you lay
back and get some rest?

14:21.088 --> 14:22.652
Gambi?

14:25.786 --> 14:27.614
Jeff, what is it?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.404
Odell...

14:29.406 --> 14:33.167
manipulated my baby
girl to commit murder.

14:33.169 --> 14:36.583
Now, you know once you kill
someone you're never the same again.

14:37.372 --> 14:39.465
That's exactly what he wanted.

14:39.467 --> 14:41.739
Come on, Jeff, take a breath.

14:50.572 --> 14:52.000
Who's that?

14:53.814 --> 14:55.945
Well, this very special young man is TC.

15:00.085 --> 15:01.466
Jefferson.

15:02.290 --> 15:03.436
TC.

15:04.492 --> 15:06.793
Excuse me. Can I talk to you?

15:14.117 --> 15:15.909
If this meta-booster works,

15:15.911 --> 15:17.669
I can temporarily augment normal cells

15:17.671 --> 15:20.172
to transfer to a particular
meta-human profile.

15:20.175 --> 15:22.082
That's unbelievable.

15:22.084 --> 15:24.461
- Everybody can have powers.
- Temporarily.

15:25.513 --> 15:27.846
If it works, I can use
it to sneak Tobias out.

15:27.848 --> 15:30.040
But I have to test it on
myself first to be certain.

15:30.043 --> 15:31.298
No.

15:31.301 --> 15:32.985
You're too important.

15:32.987 --> 15:34.711
What if something goes wrong?

15:35.873 --> 15:38.123
I'll do it.

15:38.126 --> 15:41.475
Sergeant, we're talking about
cell disruption, it could be fatal.

15:41.478 --> 15:43.454
I'm in the ASA.

15:43.456 --> 15:45.437
We take fatal risks every day.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.829
Let's do it.

15:51.881 --> 15:54.131
How can you not like puzzles?

15:54.133 --> 15:55.448
I'm just saying.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.784
Even as a kid, puzzles
completely puzzled me.

15:57.786 --> 15:59.828
Ha-ha. Funny pun.

15:59.830 --> 16:03.715
You don't know what you're
missing. They are very relaxing.

16:03.717 --> 16:07.127
Anissa, my queen. Your father is here.

16:07.129 --> 16:09.296
- "My queen"?
- Yeah. Well,

16:09.298 --> 16:13.234
at least Shonda is intelligent
and she laughs at my jokes.

16:13.237 --> 16:15.809
You see your dad. I'll
give you some space.

16:15.812 --> 16:18.093
All right, cool. Dinner will be
ready in about 15 minutes.

16:18.094 --> 16:19.472
Okay.

16:19.474 --> 16:20.807
- Shonda...
- Yes, Anissa?

16:20.809 --> 16:22.317
Let him in.

16:26.422 --> 16:28.597
- What's wrong?
- The ASA.

16:29.443 --> 16:30.881
We're going after Odell.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.294
Okay.

17:31.972 --> 17:33.551
I'm not dead yet.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.305
I'm starting to feel something.

18:03.261 --> 18:04.552
Good news.

18:04.555 --> 18:06.389
Your vitals never wavered from normal,

18:06.391 --> 18:08.494
and your genetic profile
is back to normal.

18:09.652 --> 18:12.453
The meta-booster effect
lasted roughly one hour.

18:12.456 --> 18:14.181
It should be enough.

18:14.184 --> 18:17.042
Tobias is being moved to the med ward
tomorrow to collect bone marrow.

18:17.044 --> 18:20.069
It should be much less guarded
than the detention wing.

18:20.071 --> 18:22.214
But I'm afraid we'll
still be skating uphill.

18:22.216 --> 18:23.865
I don't need you to go in.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.218
I have a cloaking device.
But since it's key to my DNA,

18:26.220 --> 18:27.671
I'm gonna have to boost Tobias with

18:27.674 --> 18:29.203
the chameleon ability to get him out.

18:29.205 --> 18:30.992
I'll be there for exfil.

18:30.995 --> 18:32.224
Let's go.

18:43.145 --> 18:45.386
You know what, I'm not
waiting around anymore.

18:45.388 --> 18:46.646
Then I'm coming with you.

18:46.648 --> 18:48.982
No, Brandon. Look, this
is not your fight, okay?

18:48.984 --> 18:50.187
I'm not trying to involve you.

18:50.190 --> 18:52.393
It's a little too late for
that, don't you think?

18:52.395 --> 18:54.978
Besides, we're both freaks, remember?

18:54.981 --> 18:56.647
So we're in this together.

18:56.650 --> 18:59.100
You helped me find Jace,
now let me help you.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.936
Fine.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.737
But there's some stuff you might
find out about me on the way

19:03.740 --> 19:05.465
that you're gonna have
to keep on the hush.

19:08.119 --> 19:10.912
You're in play, the package
just left the warehouse.

19:10.914 --> 19:13.081
Sending you an intercept...

19:13.083 --> 19:14.824
...now.

19:17.253 --> 19:19.438
You're up.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.842
You're still a little shaky,
son. Maybe, go back to bed.

19:22.874 --> 19:24.100
I have to show you...

19:26.146 --> 19:28.124
I unraveled that that Bitcoin chain.

19:39.984 --> 19:41.614
This is who had you killed.

19:42.371 --> 19:43.869
You know her?

19:43.872 --> 19:45.872
Did.

19:45.874 --> 19:49.376
She's a former ASA agent who
went into business for herself.

19:49.378 --> 19:52.356
Drug trafficking, money laundering...

19:52.359 --> 19:53.663
murder.

19:53.665 --> 19:55.081
She funded an offshore account

19:55.083 --> 19:56.997
and paid for the hit
through the dark web.

19:58.316 --> 19:59.919
See?

20:03.725 --> 20:06.332
Took her shooters a year to
find me and make their move.

20:08.847 --> 20:10.864
Well, she's not one to worry about now.

20:10.866 --> 20:12.306
What do you mean?

20:12.308 --> 20:14.547
What's to say she
doesn't hire someone else?

20:15.485 --> 20:16.795
She's dead.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.196
Excuse me.

20:25.747 --> 20:27.255
Okay.

20:28.491 --> 20:29.755
Coordinates as follows.

20:32.354 --> 20:33.995
It's them. Get ready.

20:58.313 --> 21:00.794
Don't stop. Keep going. Go, go, go!

21:07.921 --> 21:09.089
Don't move!

21:30.386 --> 21:31.749
Got your ass.

21:37.059 --> 21:38.262
He's awake.

21:48.715 --> 21:50.874
You're making a mistake...

21:50.877 --> 21:52.551
of immense proportions.

21:52.553 --> 21:53.913
Yeah, well, you already made one.

21:53.916 --> 21:56.388
You reneged on our deal,
went behind my back

21:56.390 --> 21:58.849
and made my baby girl a killer.
You think I'll let that stand?

21:58.852 --> 22:00.550
What you're doing right now is gonna get

22:00.553 --> 22:04.474
you locked up for the
rest of your lives.

22:04.477 --> 22:06.290
Agent Esposito.

22:08.026 --> 22:11.012
- You're not dead.
- No. And I have questions.

22:11.672 --> 22:13.112
I have nothing to say.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.821
Everybody talks, eventually.

22:21.248 --> 22:23.105
Since you taught me everything I know...

22:24.393 --> 22:26.036
you know this is gonna hurt.

22:28.469 --> 22:29.898
You're bluffing.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.093
You don't kill, you
won't torture either.

22:35.113 --> 22:36.428
No, he won't.

22:37.097 --> 22:38.555
But I will.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.515
I'm gonna take off your shoes and socks.

22:40.517 --> 22:42.601
And I'm gonna hammer
a nail into your foot.

22:42.603 --> 22:45.836
And I'm gonna keep going until you
tell me everything I need to know.

22:46.857 --> 22:48.413
I play golf.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.842
With the President.

22:49.845 --> 22:52.771
Yeah, well, the next time you do
it, you'll be doing it with a limp.

22:54.114 --> 22:56.114
I warned you not to make an enemy of me.

22:56.116 --> 22:58.625
You have to kill me after this
is over. You know that, right?

22:58.628 --> 23:01.578
- Okay.
- You're not okay with this.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.414
- You're a hero.
- I've never claimed to be.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.872
But you try to do the right thing.

23:08.128 --> 23:10.587
There's good in the worst of us,

23:10.589 --> 23:12.272
and evil...

23:12.275 --> 23:13.798
in the best of us.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.112
When we know this,

23:16.112 --> 23:18.093
we're less able to hate...

23:18.096 --> 23:20.055
our enemies.

23:20.057 --> 23:23.701
Did this coward just quote
Dr. King to get off the hook?

23:23.704 --> 23:25.440
I'm not a coward.

23:25.443 --> 23:27.288
I knew the man.

23:27.290 --> 23:30.982
At least, I think you'd
appreciate what I'm saying.

23:30.984 --> 23:33.306
Mmm-hmm. Here's what I'm saying.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.952
I told you not to mess
with my family. You did.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.177
So your ass is mine. Hit him.

23:44.180 --> 23:45.914
The Lord is my shepherd.

23:45.916 --> 23:47.916
Yea, though I walk through the valley

23:47.925 --> 23:49.283
of the shadow of death...

23:49.286 --> 23:50.646
Really, now you're full of prayer?

23:50.647 --> 23:52.852
The 23rd Psalm, after
all the evil you've done.

23:52.855 --> 23:55.206
"Evil"? I'm a patriot.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.396
A patriot.

23:58.399 --> 23:59.923
Do your worst.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.406
That should do it.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.990
You got it?

24:04.993 --> 24:06.357
Mmm-hmm.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.037
You tricked me.

24:15.529 --> 24:16.909
Yeah, how about that?

24:24.347 --> 24:26.513
He's out. Jeff?

24:26.515 --> 24:28.739
Don't lose yourself just to get him.

24:48.035 --> 24:49.535
Heads up.

24:49.538 --> 24:52.230
Black Lightning and Thunder
have kidnapped the director.

24:52.232 --> 24:54.137
Could you track Black Lightning again?

24:55.935 --> 24:59.070
Affirmative.

24:59.072 --> 25:02.999
I've got his energy
signature in my goggles now.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.507
I just need to go to where he
acquired the boss, and play bloodhound.

25:09.374 --> 25:12.751
I'm rescinding the immunity
for the Pierce family.

25:12.753 --> 25:15.802
We're going to find Agent
Odell and kill the Pierces.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.141
Each and every one.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.844
Hey, what is this place?

25:28.847 --> 25:30.327
It's where my uncle works.

25:31.021 --> 25:32.413
Who's your uncle?

25:32.415 --> 25:33.742
James Bond?

25:36.055 --> 25:37.341
Man!

25:38.612 --> 25:40.403
Don't touch anything.

25:40.405 --> 25:42.205
Yeah... of course.

25:45.298 --> 25:46.719
Damn.

25:46.722 --> 25:48.298
This place is dope.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.173
Hey.

25:57.176 --> 25:58.866
That's Black Lightning.

26:00.609 --> 26:01.971
And that's Thunder.

26:04.221 --> 26:05.459
You're Lightning?

26:08.642 --> 26:10.025
Wait. And he's...

26:10.027 --> 26:12.310
- Wait, he's...
- He's my father, yes.

26:12.312 --> 26:14.270
And Thunder's my sister. Now, come on.

26:14.272 --> 26:16.147
Whoa! Hey. Wait, wait. Hold on.

26:16.149 --> 26:17.394
Brandon.

26:17.397 --> 26:20.356
Hey, isn't that the guy who
was the hologram you blasted?

26:21.994 --> 26:23.172
Odell.

26:25.562 --> 26:26.975
Damn it, Dad.

26:33.834 --> 26:35.985
Hey, so, do I get a suit?

26:35.988 --> 26:37.943
No. Look, the only reason
why I brought you here

26:37.946 --> 26:39.220
and I'm showing you any of this

26:39.223 --> 26:42.340
is because those stupid ASA
commandos are after the both of us.

26:42.342 --> 26:44.175
So we need to stick together.

26:44.177 --> 26:46.454
Besides, you don't
have a name yet, so...

26:46.457 --> 26:48.456
Damn. Right...

26:49.233 --> 26:50.601
What would my name be?

26:51.568 --> 26:52.891
"Quakeboy"?

26:53.662 --> 26:55.105
"Earth Force"?

26:55.996 --> 26:56.996
"Geo".

26:56.997 --> 26:59.259
Look, I don't know.
Just stay here, okay?

26:59.261 --> 27:01.576
There's a fridge in the
back with snacks and drinks.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.640
Nobody should bother you.
Just don't touch anything.

27:17.076 --> 27:18.268
I'm Destiny.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.871
Welcome to the Ultimate O.

27:20.874 --> 27:22.309
Right this way.

27:25.601 --> 27:28.027
We believe in equal opportunity,

27:28.030 --> 27:29.321
here at the Ultimate O.

27:30.557 --> 27:32.574
You have your choice of male...

27:34.284 --> 27:35.934
female...

27:35.937 --> 27:37.413
or both.

27:38.666 --> 27:39.781
So what will it be?

27:41.285 --> 27:42.617
What you think?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.458
Now...

27:49.460 --> 27:51.802
So, as far as price...

27:54.706 --> 27:56.107
You.

27:58.585 --> 28:00.100
You.

28:30.778 --> 28:33.413
Y'all go ahead, get started
without me. I'll be right back.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.320
Damn!

29:19.791 --> 29:22.516
Yeah. There you go.

29:32.149 --> 29:35.062
If they like their feet tickled,

29:35.065 --> 29:39.115
then make sure someone
tickles their feet.

29:41.855 --> 29:47.409
...feet tickled, then make sure
someone tickles their feet.

29:53.199 --> 29:55.950
You ought to get some serious
paper up in there, boss.

29:55.952 --> 29:58.308
I'm talking about the
whole place was packed.

29:58.311 --> 29:59.723
Yeah.

30:00.809 --> 30:02.200
There was a lady in there.

30:02.203 --> 30:04.545
I don't know who she is,
but she seemed important.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.265
Yeah, that's her right there.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.885
...tickled, then make
sure someone tickles...

30:13.887 --> 30:15.279
That's Lady Eve.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.150
The last time I saw her ass,
she was floating in a vat.

30:22.329 --> 30:24.074
She's been brought back from the dead.

30:26.566 --> 30:28.125
Let's pack these guns up.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.004
For sure.

30:34.576 --> 30:36.118
Okay.

30:39.944 --> 30:42.765
The entrance you need to
use will have guards here,

30:42.767 --> 30:44.859
and here.

30:44.861 --> 30:46.568
Once inside, you'll be 20 meters from

30:46.571 --> 30:48.577
the medical wing where they have Tobias.

30:51.875 --> 30:53.034
Okay.

31:02.244 --> 31:03.453
So how much longer?

31:03.455 --> 31:05.788
Here we go. It's rendering.

31:05.790 --> 31:07.294
By the time it's finished,

31:07.297 --> 31:11.242
we use the biometrics and keywords
we've collected to simulate Odell.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.037
Then we go into the ASA system

31:13.039 --> 31:15.974
to take down the perimeter
and withdraw from Freeland.

31:15.976 --> 31:17.833
By the time they realize it's not him,

31:17.835 --> 31:19.895
we'll have taken back the city.

31:19.898 --> 31:22.455
All right.

31:22.457 --> 31:24.185
This is Agent Odell.

31:24.186 --> 31:27.849
I am ordering all officers to
withdraw from Freeland.

31:30.073 --> 31:31.741
Damn, that's freaky.

31:31.744 --> 31:34.184
If you don't like this one,
you can kiss my ass.

31:36.518 --> 31:38.788
I guess I missed my call
that you found him, huh?

31:38.790 --> 31:40.704
- Jen, slow down.
- You lied to me.

31:40.707 --> 31:42.668
This is better for everybody. Trust me.

31:42.671 --> 31:44.431
I'm done trusting you.

31:46.244 --> 31:48.113
We're under attack.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.070
Look, take care of
the data. We got this.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.971
Get down, get down!

32:04.546 --> 32:05.815
Khalil?

32:14.809 --> 32:17.281
And here I thought it was
gonna be another boring day.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.206
We're leaving.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.177
I'm afraid you didn't think
this through, Dr. Stewart.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.380
How am I supposed to just
walk right out the front door?

32:31.381 --> 32:33.200
You'll have Maryam's chameleon powers.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.544
So, yes, to answer your question,

32:34.546 --> 32:36.466
we're gonna walk right
through the side entrance.

32:36.467 --> 32:37.704
Hmm.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.552
Looks like Christmas
came early this year.

32:42.387 --> 32:44.003
I'll admit,

32:44.005 --> 32:46.226
you're a lot smarter than
I gave you credit for.

32:49.894 --> 32:51.027
You can't run.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.021
We have to stick together.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.324
Run?

32:57.310 --> 32:59.018
Now, why would I do that?

32:59.020 --> 33:01.246
I have Black Lightning's wife.

33:01.248 --> 33:03.072
I'm not running anywhere.

33:03.074 --> 33:06.336
You thought I was your golden
goose, Dr. Stewart, but in reality...

33:09.339 --> 33:10.714
you're mine.

33:33.313 --> 33:35.220
Dad, don't let him touch you.

33:52.039 --> 33:53.325
No!

33:56.303 --> 33:58.553
- Jen, stop.
- Khalil.

33:58.555 --> 34:00.830
- Khalil, are you okay?
- Jen, let us go.

34:00.832 --> 34:03.312
Guys, what's going on? Why
y'all trying to hurt him?

34:03.313 --> 34:05.310
- Because he's not Khalil!
- No, he's a murderer.

34:05.312 --> 34:07.103
Khalil, talk to me, please.

34:08.565 --> 34:10.514
Get Agent Odell out of here.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.840
Yeah.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.643
I'll deal with the Pierces.

34:13.645 --> 34:15.146
You need to stop them!

34:15.572 --> 34:17.262
Sir.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.007
Watch it.

34:19.011 --> 34:20.317
This way.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.540
Jennifer Pierce,

34:25.543 --> 34:27.431
you are a pain in the ass.

34:27.434 --> 34:29.248
You need to let us go.

34:29.251 --> 34:30.460
Khalil, stop.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.735
Just stop.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.766
It's okay. I got you.

34:45.893 --> 34:47.018
I got you.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.543
He's still alive.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.338
Damn.

35:12.798 --> 35:14.369
Not bad.

35:14.372 --> 35:16.280
Welcome to the Ultimate O.

35:16.934 --> 35:19.009
Men, women or both?

35:19.011 --> 35:20.143
Lady Eve.

35:21.546 --> 35:23.296
We don't have anyone here by that name.

35:23.298 --> 35:24.862
Yes, you do.

35:24.865 --> 35:26.261
Now, take me to her.

35:28.136 --> 35:30.289
I think it's best you leave.

35:30.292 --> 35:32.648
Ain't nobody ask you what you think.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.258
Do y'all know who this is?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.569
Big man...

35:42.609 --> 35:44.225
take the night off.

35:44.228 --> 35:45.519
Let's go.

35:45.522 --> 35:46.782
All right.

35:51.392 --> 35:52.800
In the next two seconds,

35:54.179 --> 35:57.618
you're gonna have Lady
Eve's location on your lips,

35:57.621 --> 35:59.414
or a bullet in your head.

36:02.443 --> 36:04.146
Follow me, please.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.073
Excuse me.

36:21.864 --> 36:23.497
Well, well, well.

36:24.776 --> 36:27.711
Thought I saw you when
I was in resurrection...

36:28.822 --> 36:30.714
but I assumed I was dreaming.

36:32.033 --> 36:34.387
Now you're back on top in Freeland.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.901
I like this little hustle
that you got going on here.

36:40.434 --> 36:42.945
Let me guess, you want a piece?

36:42.948 --> 36:44.183
Nah.

36:45.565 --> 36:47.356
I'm taking the whole thing.

36:48.517 --> 36:50.468
As of right now, you work for me.

36:51.553 --> 36:53.028
Ain't gonna happen.

36:53.030 --> 36:55.346
I know where Lazarus'
creepy ass is staying.

36:55.348 --> 36:58.033
If I smoke both of y'all, there
ain't no coming back for you.

36:58.035 --> 37:01.656
Be careful writing checks with your
mouth that your ass can't cash.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.650
Honey...

37:03.653 --> 37:07.255
you'd be surprised of
what this ass can do.

37:08.212 --> 37:11.621
Now, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave,

37:11.623 --> 37:15.801
and take the 40 hitters you
got waiting outside with you.

37:20.582 --> 37:22.282
In consideration

37:22.284 --> 37:26.419
of what you have done in this
community for the past 20 years,

37:26.421 --> 37:29.518
I'm gonna give you 48 hours to
get some sense into your head.

37:43.245 --> 37:44.887
That was disrespectful.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.808
How do you wanna handle it?

37:47.811 --> 37:49.251
We deal or we die.

37:50.663 --> 37:52.210
For now.

38:30.035 --> 38:32.109
Odell just left the perimeter.

38:32.111 --> 38:34.037
He's probably heading back to Gotham.

38:34.039 --> 38:35.415
Oh, my God.

38:37.345 --> 38:38.842
Hey, is that your ex in there?

38:39.594 --> 38:40.844
Yeah.

38:42.047 --> 38:43.880
He was actually gonna kill me.

38:43.882 --> 38:45.748
That's because he's not your ex.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.532
The ASA rebuilt him.

38:47.535 --> 38:50.553
They put a chip in his head
so they could control his mind.

38:50.555 --> 38:51.700
They can do that?

38:51.703 --> 38:54.056
You knew Khalil was alive
and you didn't tell me.

38:54.059 --> 38:56.059
How could you keep
something like that from me?

38:56.061 --> 38:57.766
Jen, so you can go after somebody who

38:57.769 --> 38:59.470
looks like they're your ex-boyfriend,

38:59.472 --> 39:01.064
get heartbroken, maybe even killed?

39:01.066 --> 39:02.510
I'll never forgive you for this.

39:02.513 --> 39:03.861
Whoa, wait a minute,

39:03.862 --> 39:06.494
let's calm down before we
say something we don't mean.

39:06.496 --> 39:08.246
Your sister was only
trying to protect you.

39:09.405 --> 39:11.315
Why does everyone think
I need their protection?

39:11.317 --> 39:13.168
I don't, I'm not helpless.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.542
If I had known, maybe I
could've gotten through to him.

39:15.545 --> 39:16.945
Jen.

39:16.948 --> 39:18.451
It's not that simple.

39:19.492 --> 39:20.750
So we're not even gonna try?

39:20.752 --> 39:22.036
Hey.

39:22.039 --> 39:23.377
Who's Jen?

39:25.017 --> 39:26.306
That's me.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.167
He loves you.

39:30.169 --> 39:31.591
How do you know that?

39:33.953 --> 39:35.273
He told me.

39:48.538 --> 39:50.372
This way, follow me.

39:50.374 --> 39:53.115
You said it was gonna
last more than an hour.

39:53.118 --> 39:54.910
I don't know.

39:54.913 --> 39:57.570
You have a uniquely
altered genotype, remember?

39:57.572 --> 39:59.572
Are you trying to set me up?

39:59.574 --> 40:01.383
I'm not.

40:01.386 --> 40:03.985
The surveillance cameras in
this section are disabled.

40:03.988 --> 40:05.553
For now. Now, come on!

40:07.372 --> 40:10.391
You know, I had you
all wrong, Dr. Stewart.

40:10.394 --> 40:13.803
I thought you was one of them
saditty, bougie, squeaky-clean sisters,

40:13.805 --> 40:15.722
afraid to get her hands dirty.

40:15.724 --> 40:17.005
But, you know,

40:17.008 --> 40:18.549
it's refreshing to know

40:18.552 --> 40:21.052
that Black Lightning's
wife is a bit more flexible.

40:21.054 --> 40:22.661
Shut up and keep moving!

40:26.365 --> 40:28.962
Where the hell is he? He
should be here by now.

40:28.965 --> 40:31.160
Whoever you're waiting for,
probably got canceled.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.963
The ASA is good at stuff like that.

40:34.434 --> 40:35.875
You know what, Dr. Stewart?

40:36.638 --> 40:38.712
You're not that smart after all.

40:41.949 --> 40:43.407
Did you really think

40:43.409 --> 40:46.336
I would give you powers
and not give myself any?

40:46.338 --> 40:48.003
You black women.

40:48.006 --> 40:50.357
Always so damn tricky.

40:52.052 --> 40:53.940
You thick-lipped bastard!

40:55.847 --> 40:57.088
Thanks, Erica.

40:58.016 --> 40:59.131
I owe you one.

41:13.272 --> 41:14.748
What happened?

41:14.751 --> 41:16.399
I had to go to plan B.

41:17.819 --> 41:19.151
Outstanding.

41:19.153 --> 41:20.723
Help me load him into the back.

41:39.224 --> 41:40.953
