00:33.767 --> 00:36.167
-Guys? Guys?

00:36.200 --> 00:38.367
-Josh is inviting a boy over
for casual sex.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.800
-Really?
Well, that is interesting.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.667
But also, who wants
to smash a piñata?

00:43.700 --> 00:45.033
-You made a piñata?

00:45.067 --> 00:47.233
-Yeah, I made
a beautiful piñata.

00:47.267 --> 00:49.133
-Why'd you make a piñata?

00:49.167 --> 00:50.200
-What?

00:50.233 --> 00:51.200
What do you mean "why"?

00:51.233 --> 00:53.100
-I mean, why did
you make a piñata?

00:53.133 --> 00:55.533
-Would you ask
a bird why it sings?
-(phone beeps)

00:55.567 --> 00:57.567
-Would you ask a divorced man
why he joined a pottery class?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.033
Some things don't
need to be questioned.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.733
-Okay, what's in it?
-It doesn't matter!

01:00.767 --> 01:02.300
Free your mind
of all that nonsense

01:02.333 --> 01:03.800
and just focus
on what's real,

01:03.833 --> 01:05.467
which is that
we have a piñata.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.733
-All right, all right.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.733
-Okay, no. Actually, no.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.433
I thought you'd be excited.
You're not excited.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.333
I don't want to smash it
with people who aren't excited.

01:12.367 --> 01:13.667
-No, I think I'm excited.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.767
-You're not excited!
-I just need a moment

01:15.800 --> 01:17.333
to get my head around it, okay?

01:17.367 --> 01:18.633
It's a bit of a shock.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.167
-Okay.
-Josh: Okay!

01:22.467 --> 01:23.633
Yeah, I'm excited!

01:23.667 --> 01:25.433
-Claire, are you excited
about the piñata?

01:25.467 --> 01:26.400
-Sure.
-Yeah?

01:26.433 --> 01:28.433
-Ole!
-Arriba!

01:28.467 --> 01:33.800
It is full of secrets.

01:33.833 --> 01:36.233
You and Claire have been
keeping secrets,

01:36.267 --> 01:37.333
and I don't like it.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.800
I think we shouldn't
keep secrets.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.467
So, I've taken all
of our secrets,

01:40.500 --> 01:41.333
and I've put it in here.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.700
Mine, Josh's,
Claire's, and John's.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.367
-What secrets does John have?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.433
-(whispers)
John hates foreigners.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.800
-(gasps)
John! That does not suit you!

01:49.833 --> 01:51.333
-Tom:
I hope that by airing all

01:51.367 --> 01:52.567
of these secrets,
I will become the most

01:52.600 --> 01:55.433
honest member of the group,
and therefore, a better person

01:55.467 --> 01:56.700
than both of you.

01:56.733 --> 01:57.833
-All right. Fine. Stand back.
-* One, two

01:57.867 --> 01:59.467
-Go, go.
-* One, two, three, four

01:59.500 --> 02:01.133
* Ooh-ooh-ooh
-(grunts)

02:01.167 --> 02:02.833
-* Yeah, I'll be fine

02:02.867 --> 02:04.533
* Yeah, yeah

02:04.567 --> 02:06.700
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

02:06.733 --> 02:08.433
* Oh, yeah, here

02:08.467 --> 02:10.200
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

02:10.233 --> 02:11.200
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

02:11.233 --> 02:12.700
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

02:12.733 --> 02:13.800
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

02:13.833 --> 02:17.233
* I left better behind
to be fine *

02:17.267 --> 02:19.133
* Yeah, yeah, fine

02:19.167 --> 02:21.800
* Make my mama
turn another blind eye *

02:21.833 --> 02:24.067
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:24.100 --> 02:26.533
* I left better behind
to be fine *

02:26.567 --> 02:27.633
-(laughter)
-(phone rings)

02:27.667 --> 02:28.800
-(grunts)

02:31.067 --> 02:32.067
-Arnie?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.267
-Joshy!

02:33.300 --> 02:35.667
-We're trying to smash Tom's
piñata, but it won't break.

02:35.700 --> 02:36.633
It's a shit piñata.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.800
-He finished the piñata?
Oh, thank goodness.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.667
I've been the only one
he can talk to about the piñata.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.033
Do you know what
that's been like?

02:42.067 --> 02:43.533
Bad! That's what
it's been like.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.433
-It's not shit. You guys are
hitting it weak on purpose

02:45.467 --> 02:46.400
to protect your secrets.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.800
-I just cannot talk
to you at the moment.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.533
-Okay. I love you. Have fun.
-Josh: Okay. Love you.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.633
Have fun at Maths Camp.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.100
(laughs obnoxiously)

02:55.133 --> 02:56.533
Fun... fun at Maths Camp!

02:56.567 --> 02:58.433
Tom, Claire, laugh
at Arnold with me.

02:58.467 --> 02:59.567
-(all laugh)

03:00.800 --> 03:02.733
-Maths Camp!
(laughs)

03:02.767 --> 03:04.600
-Ha ha!
-Bye.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.200
-Tom:
Ooh! I got one.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.600
One of mine.
That's annoying.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.567
Annoying that it's one of mine,
but that's okay because

03:09.600 --> 03:10.733
I'm open with my friends.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.200
Trusting.
-Just read it!

03:12.233 --> 03:13.367
-(paper unfolding)

03:13.400 --> 03:16.733
-"I knew Josh was gay
when he was 18

03:16.767 --> 03:19.400
"because I found gay porn
on his laptop,

03:19.433 --> 03:22.433
"but I did not say anything
because I didn't have

03:22.467 --> 03:23.733
"the courage to bring it up."
-Josh: No!

03:23.767 --> 03:25.433
-Josh, you stole my youth.
-(Josh's phone beeps)

03:25.467 --> 03:27.133
-I thought it was
a phase, okay?

03:27.167 --> 03:28.167
Like Gangnam Style.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.567
-Can you not be
texting sex friends

03:29.600 --> 03:31.467
when my feelings are
being crushed, please?

03:31.500 --> 03:33.667
-I've invited him over,
and I instantly regret it.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.900
-What's his name?

03:34.933 --> 03:37.600
-I don't know.
Yeah, what's in a name?
-(Tom hits the piñata)

03:37.633 --> 03:39.633
-It's... not... fair.

03:39.667 --> 03:42.700
Gay... guys...
get... everything!

03:42.733 --> 03:44.400
-Oh, you get plenty!
-Ooh!

03:44.433 --> 03:45.467
What's this?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.833
-Oh, yes.

03:47.867 --> 03:52.067
So, um, Josh, you remember
when you lost your passport
in Thailand?

03:52.100 --> 03:54.233
-(laughs)
-Yes!

03:54.267 --> 03:56.200
-And, uh, we looked
all through your room

03:56.233 --> 03:57.567
and you asked me
if I had it,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.833
and I said I definitely
did not have your passport?

03:59.867 --> 04:03.267
-Yes?
-And then you had to go
to an embassy in Bangkok

04:03.300 --> 04:05.367
and wait for three hours--
-Yes, I remember!

04:05.400 --> 04:08.167
-Let me finish.
Let me finish.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.667
While you also had diarrhea.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.500
Yeah. Yeah, I found it.

04:13.533 --> 04:16.133
It was in my pa--
-(screams)

04:16.167 --> 04:17.667
-In my passport wallet.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.400
-Fine! Give me one.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.233
-(laughs)

04:22.267 --> 04:24.600
-Claire.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.400
"Claire once told Tom that
no one in the world

04:26.433 --> 04:28.367
"makes her laugh
as much as Josh."
Oh, that's nice.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.367
-Tom, what the fuck?!

04:29.400 --> 04:31.100
He was never supposed
to fucking hear that!

04:31.133 --> 04:33.400
-I mean, what a fun game!

04:33.433 --> 04:35.300
It's a nice time we're having.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.633
-Hey. Okay.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.600
All right, Josh...

04:40.833 --> 04:43.667
"Josh thinks Claire's mum is
a bad cook."

04:43.700 --> 04:45.100
-Oh.
-She's a great cook.

04:45.133 --> 04:48.467
-"Claire thinks
she is good, but she is not."
-(Josh's phone beeps)

04:48.500 --> 04:50.400
-Oh, yeah.
-I hate you.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.600
-Oh, my God.
He's coming over.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.267
He said yes.
I did-- I did not
think he was gonna say--

04:53.300 --> 04:54.533
-He's coming over?

04:54.567 --> 04:57.567
-I need you guys
to come and tell me
if my room smells weird.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
-(sniffs)

05:01.633 --> 05:04.067
-(sniffs)

05:04.100 --> 05:05.067
-(sniffs)

05:05.100 --> 05:06.467
-(sniffs)

05:06.500 --> 05:07.533
Hm...

05:07.567 --> 05:08.800
-The air smells fine!

05:08.833 --> 05:10.067
-Fine?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.633
-Yeah, it just smells like you.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.200
-Like me? I have a smell?

05:13.233 --> 05:15.400
-Not a bad smell.
-(Claire laughs)

05:15.433 --> 05:17.500
-Maybe I should light
a scented candle.

05:17.533 --> 05:18.500
No? No.

05:18.533 --> 05:19.667
Too creepy.
Too romantic.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.167
-Claire: What does he look like?
-Nice enough.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.367
-Show us.
-Claire: Show.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.400
-Show us.
-Claire: Come on!

05:28.867 --> 05:31.233
-Oh. Oh.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.067
-Aww.
-Oh, yeah.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.633
Yeah, he looks like
a serial killer.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.700
-What if he's dangerous?

05:35.733 --> 05:37.300
-If he's dangerous,
I'll scream.

05:37.333 --> 05:38.600
-Well, how will we know

05:38.633 --> 05:40.500
if it's a good scream
or a bad scream?

05:40.533 --> 05:41.433
-You'll know.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.267
I don't make any noises
during sex, okay?

05:43.300 --> 05:45.033
If you hear any noise,
any at all that isn't

05:45.067 --> 05:47.167
muttering apologies,
then you should interject.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.633
-You don't dirty talk?
-No.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.567
-You can't dirty talk
with a voice like that.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.333
-Yes, I can. I could. Yes.

05:52.367 --> 05:53.400
Yeah. Uh...

05:53.433 --> 05:54.533
Suck it!

05:54.567 --> 05:55.833
Yeah, suck it!

05:55.867 --> 05:58.233
-(imitates Josh)
Suck it. Suck it.
-Oh...

05:58.267 --> 05:59.100
-No.
-Suck it.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.567
-No, it's really weird.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.167
-Suck it.
Suck it, fag.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400
Suck it, fag boy.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.767
You suck it, fag boy-- boy.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.467
-Will he be okay
with you calling him that?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.400
-Yeah, I'm...

06:08.433 --> 06:11.200
I'm appropriating.
I'm mi-- I'm misapprop--

06:11.233 --> 06:12.467
What am I doing?
-Reappropriating.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.267
-I'm reappropriating.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.667
-"Suck it, fag boy"
is empowering?
-No, Thomas!

06:16.700 --> 06:18.300
You're not allowed to say it.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.533
-Gah! I don't get to
say anything.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.067
-TV: Next...
-This is stupid, yeah?

06:24.100 --> 06:25.500
-No, I think it's brilliant.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.667
-I just wish we could
stay on this couch,

06:27.700 --> 06:30.033
I could wear a big jumper,
and we could make fun of people.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.567
-I just don't understand
what your problem is.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.667
-You're very frustrated today.
-Well, you're not communicating.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.667
-He's nervous.
-About what?

06:35.700 --> 06:39.500
-Well, I just sort of wish
he was a glazed ham

06:39.533 --> 06:43.833
and instead of hooking up,
I could just eat glazed ham.

06:43.867 --> 06:46.167
-Should we guess why
you're being weird?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.600
-Mm... do you feel weird

06:47.633 --> 06:49.567
kissing someone when
you have a boyfriend?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.300
-Yes.
-Tom: But...

06:51.333 --> 06:52.500
you are allowed.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.633
He wants you to.
It's brilliant.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.367
-Are you worried that
the stranger will be ugly

06:56.400 --> 06:57.533
and/or a creep
and/or a catfish?

06:57.567 --> 06:58.733
-Yes.
-Claire: Are you worried

06:58.767 --> 07:00.600
the stranger will think that
you are ugly and/or a creep?

07:00.633 --> 07:03.500
-Yes.
-Tom: Are you nervous
about having bad breath?

07:03.533 --> 07:04.233
-Well, I am now.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.067
-Well, you don't.
-Not yet.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.467
-What?
-Gross.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.400
-Not from sex. Just...

07:08.433 --> 07:10.767
if he, like, maybe eats
cured meats or...

07:10.800 --> 07:11.833
-(knocking)

07:11.867 --> 07:14.200
-(barks)
-Go. Get.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.133
-(TV chatter)

07:21.200 --> 07:22.467
-Hi.
-Hello.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.133
-Hello. Um...

07:24.167 --> 07:25.600
so I realize that I, um...

07:25.633 --> 07:27.500
yeah, I don't know your name.

07:27.533 --> 07:28.500
-It's Ben.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.300
Let me guess. You're a...

07:30.333 --> 07:32.233
Quentin or a Sebastian?

07:32.267 --> 07:34.233
-No, I'm Josh. Yeah.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.667
Um, this is John.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.067
-Hello, dog.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.667
-Yeah I have a...
Do you want a drink?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.833
I have wine. Just spare.
Just spare in the cupboard

07:42.867 --> 07:44.500
because I am an adult.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.500
-No, I don't drink.
-(TV chatter)

07:46.533 --> 07:48.200
-Josh:
There was a plane crash.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.700
270 dead.

07:49.733 --> 07:51.800
-That's irresponsible.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.067
-Yeah.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.233
-Could we turn off the news?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.133
-Yeah. shit, sorry.
Yeah, right, yeah.

07:57.167 --> 07:59.267
It is, um...
it is not hot.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.433
No. Okay.

08:00.467 --> 08:01.667
Um... shit. Fuck.

08:01.700 --> 08:02.833
Tom, where's the remote?

08:02.867 --> 08:04.300
-TV:
Terrorism is a factor...

08:04.333 --> 08:06.233
-1,000 apologies.

08:06.267 --> 08:10.133
-Who's that?
-That's Tom, my housemate.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.433
-Is he hiding from me?

08:11.467 --> 08:13.033
-Yeah. Yeah, I made him hide.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.400
Um, you said
you had pizza.

08:15.433 --> 08:17.267
How was...
how was your pizza?

08:17.300 --> 08:19.067
-Mm, I never ordered it.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.400
-Well, what did you eat?
You need to eat.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.300
-I didn't eat dinner.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.100
-Okay, well, I can
make you a snack.

08:24.133 --> 08:26.033
That's a thing.
That's a thing I can do.

08:26.067 --> 08:26.733
-Okay.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.133
Wonderful.

08:32.533 --> 08:35.400
-Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.433
-Sorry.

08:36.467 --> 08:38.367
-It's okay.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.800
-Mm...

08:39.833 --> 08:41.167
I-- Oh, I have puff pastry.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.067
I can make a puff pastry pizza.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.033
-I don't think I've had
anyone offer to cook for me
before a hook-up.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.367
-Uh, yeah, okay, so what it is
is it's, um, puff pastry,

08:48.400 --> 08:49.667
but I'm going to turn it
into a pizza.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.100
It's, um...

08:51.133 --> 08:52.233
it's a child's afternoon tea.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.800
It's not, like,
a grand romantic gesture.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.733
-I mean, maybe light a candle,
but an oven?

08:56.767 --> 08:58.500
You know, I feel
like Ted Hughes.

08:58.533 --> 09:01.233
-Yeah, no one knows
who that is.

09:01.267 --> 09:02.633
-(scoffs)
Ted Hughes.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.133
He was married to Sylvia Plath.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.100
-No.
-She wrote "Daddy."

09:09.133 --> 09:10.033
Um...
-Mm-mm.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.467
-She gassed herself
in the family oven.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.033
It was a joke.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.400
-That is a horrible joke,
isn't it? Oh.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.433
Oh.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.167
-Where's your bedroom?

09:21.200 --> 09:22.533
-Uh-- oh-- um...

09:23.700 --> 09:25.333
Yeah.

09:28.733 --> 09:29.800
-(sighs)

09:42.567 --> 09:44.100
-(clatters)

09:46.100 --> 09:48.633
-Hmm, hey, what's this?

09:50.133 --> 09:51.400
-Ants kept coming in.

09:51.433 --> 09:52.667
-Are you gonna fix it?

09:52.700 --> 09:53.767
-I did.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.367
-(scoffs)

09:56.767 --> 10:00.533
Oh, Tom, why is everything
in your room so sticky?

10:00.567 --> 10:02.267
-So many questions.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.400
-(groans)
How long do I have to
be in here?

10:04.433 --> 10:05.600
I feel itchy!

10:05.633 --> 10:08.433
-Okay, so if you're going to
be in here the whole night,

10:08.467 --> 10:10.600
you need to respect
that this is my space

10:10.633 --> 10:11.667
and that you chose to enter it.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.500
-What are we gonna
do all night?

10:13.533 --> 10:14.733
-I'm not going out.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.367
-I know, Tom. Relax.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.033
-We could... make out.

10:23.067 --> 10:25.433
-No!
-Kidding, obviously.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.700
-No!

10:51.733 --> 10:55.333
Jesus, Tom.
You're just the worst person!

10:55.367 --> 10:56.667
You have a girlfriend!

10:58.200 --> 11:00.167
This didn't happen, okay?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.367
Here.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.367
What the hell
is wrong with me?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.700
-Yep, you are really
off the rails.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.500
-Um... I'm gonna need
some help. Yeah.

11:29.533 --> 11:30.767
-What-- what can I do?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.700
-I just -- I need you to un--
undo do my little cuff buttons.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.367
Thank you.

11:37.367 --> 11:40.433
-So, uh, what--
what do you do?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.233
-Really? You want to know
what I do?

11:42.267 --> 11:44.767
-I mean, I thought it might
just be better than silence

11:44.800 --> 11:46.600
whilst you undo
my little cuff buttons.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.633
-I'm a journalist.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.700
-God, I...

11:49.733 --> 11:51.567
I thought we stopped
doing that, no?

11:51.600 --> 11:52.633
-Journalism?
-Yeah.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.200
-You thought we stopped
doing journalism?
-Yeah.

11:54.233 --> 11:57.700
-I mostly write for people
who can take off their shirts
all on their own.

11:57.733 --> 11:59.233
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

11:59.267 --> 12:01.767
-Do you know what I love?
BuzzFeed.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.233
-(chuckles)
Fuck you.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.400
-Where do you live?

12:12.433 --> 12:15.400
-Northside.
Not far from here.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.500
-Ah, do you have any siblings?

12:17.533 --> 12:21.400
-I have two siblings--
a brother and a sister.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.067
My sister just had a baby.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.167
We don't know
who the father is.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.267
She's forgetful.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
-I'm an only child.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.167
Do you have any pets?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.167
-All the questions
you're asking sound like

12:30.200 --> 12:31.833
we're in English
language classes.

12:31.867 --> 12:34.433
-Yeah, yeah. I just don't know
you well enough to know

12:34.467 --> 12:36.467
what questions lead
somewhere interesting.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.167
-I have a cat.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.533
-Ah, that's a shame.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.267
-(cuckoo clock chirps)

12:44.867 --> 12:48.333
-So, I invented this game
called Penis Or Not Penis.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.767
-No thank you.
That sounds like a stupid game.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.267
-Okay, one of us thinks
about a penis

12:55.300 --> 12:57.067
or something other
than a penis,

12:57.100 --> 12:58.633
and then the other person
has to guess

12:58.667 --> 13:03.267
whether they're thinking
about a penis or not penis.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.267
-Oh, my God.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.200
How long does gay sex take?

13:10.233 --> 13:12.700
-I heard the shower,
which from what I understand,

13:12.733 --> 13:15.233
means they've had
full intercourse
at least once.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.233
-Tom, what are we even doing?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.233
I just don't know.
-I don't know.

13:19.267 --> 13:21.433
Hanging out.
Being awesome.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.167
-I feel like I just spent
a month locked in a room

13:25.200 --> 13:27.200
to come back here
to get locked in another room.

13:27.233 --> 13:28.467
-Ugh, you're being boring.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.133
-What? I'm being boring?

13:30.167 --> 13:31.567
You don't even want
to leave the house.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.500
-Whinge, whinge, whinge.
-Oh, whatever.

13:33.533 --> 13:35.667
-Whinge, whinge, whinge.
-Fuck off!

13:35.700 --> 13:38.800
-Josh is having fun.
-Josh is having sex.

13:38.833 --> 13:39.767
-I'm having fun.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.533
-Yeah, well, you are
very easily entertained.

13:42.567 --> 13:43.633
You're like a puppy.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.167
-You could be
more easily entertained.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.467
You could create entertainment.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.733
You could very easily find sex
on the Internet

13:51.767 --> 13:53.500
if you really wanted,
but you just keep

13:53.533 --> 13:55.167
waiting for more,
and I just don't think

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
there's any more, babe.

13:56.233 --> 13:59.100
First you're like,
"Oh, my life's in Germany,"

13:59.133 --> 14:00.367
so you go to Germany.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.133
Then once you're
in Germany, you're like,
"Oh, I'm so lonely."

14:03.167 --> 14:04.733
Meanwhile, I'm here...

14:04.767 --> 14:06.367
I'm trying to create
a lovely game

14:06.400 --> 14:09.400
of Penis Or Not Penis for us,
and you're just sitting there,

14:09.433 --> 14:11.567
complaining again that
you're not somewhere else.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.200
-Penis.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.200
-Yes.
-Yes!

14:26.233 --> 14:27.333
Okay, fine.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.300
If we're gonna this,
I want stakes.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.733
First one to ten wins,

14:31.767 --> 14:33.333
and then the other person
has to do a dare.

14:33.367 --> 14:34.533
-Great.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.367
Penis.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
-Ugh! Penis!
-(chuckles)

14:44.333 --> 14:47.367
-My housemates thought
you looked like a serial killer.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.100
-It's a big leap, isn't it?
-(chuckles)

14:51.133 --> 14:53.167
-To decide that I don't just
look like a murderer,

14:53.200 --> 14:55.333
but that I've murdered
multiple times.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.767
-Yeah.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.700
-Uh, when you saw me,
did you think that

14:58.733 --> 15:01.433
I looked, uh, cuter or less cute
than in my pictures?

15:01.467 --> 15:03.267
-I thought you were
out of focus in your picture,

15:03.300 --> 15:05.100
but that's just your face.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.767
You've got
an out-of-focus face.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.567
-Really?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.567
-What did you think of me?

15:10.600 --> 15:13.233
-Uh... equi-cute.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.067
-I like your face though,
to be clear.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.533
I am enjoying it.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.600
-Yeah, I'd-- I'd just prefer
not to bring it up,

15:18.633 --> 15:20.033
if that's okay.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.133
-People often ask
if I'm an only child,

15:31.167 --> 15:33.567
but mostly what
they're really asking is,

15:33.600 --> 15:34.833
"Do you realize
you're being a jerk?"

15:34.867 --> 15:37.500
-No, you know that's not
an only-child thing, okay?

15:37.533 --> 15:38.700
I'm lovely.

15:38.733 --> 15:39.500
Lots of people say that.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.367
They say,
"Josh is just lovely."

15:41.400 --> 15:43.800
-When I was little, my parents
had me tested for Asperger's.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.333
-Oh yeah, I can see that.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.800
-Not penis.
-Dammit!

16:07.833 --> 16:10.333
-Yes!
-(grunts)

16:10.367 --> 16:12.233
Okay.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.200
Mm...

16:17.300 --> 16:19.033
Not penis?

16:19.067 --> 16:20.500
-Penis.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.367
-Tom, you can lie!

16:22.400 --> 16:24.033
-It's an honesty system.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.533
-I wanna write it down.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.000
-No, no.
It's full trust.

16:27.033 --> 16:29.833
-There's too much
at stake for trust.
-It doesn't make a difference.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.267
I can just write down "penis"

16:31.300 --> 16:33.100
and then not think
about penis to trick you.

16:33.133 --> 16:34.800
-Tom, there is
no way you can tell

16:34.833 --> 16:36.600
if someone is thinking
about penis or not.

16:36.633 --> 16:39.067
-You can't, I can.
That's why I'm winning.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.033
-Okay.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.200
-Not penis.
-Boom! Penis.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.633
-(knocking)
-Shoot.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.100
Y-- yeah?

16:55.567 --> 16:58.067
-Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.667
Can I please have permission
to go to the toilet?

17:00.700 --> 17:02.333
-Yes.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.367
-Thank you, kind sir.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.100
-(Claire cackles)

17:07.133 --> 17:09.467
-Yeah, Tom lost a dare.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.167
-Yeah, Tom's a babe.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.500
-No.

17:16.700 --> 17:20.167
-(phone vibrates)
-(water sloshing)

17:21.867 --> 17:24.300
-(phone vibrates)

17:24.333 --> 17:25.467
-Who's that?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.567
-Boyfriend. It's my boyfriend.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.033
-Okay. Right.
-We're open.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.700
-How long have
you been together?

17:33.733 --> 17:35.300
-Um, a few months.

17:36.467 --> 17:37.833
-How long do you think
you'll be together?

17:37.867 --> 17:40.700
-Um... I don't know.

17:40.733 --> 17:43.067
Yeah, but he-- I think he wants
to be together forever,

17:43.100 --> 17:44.233
which scares me a lot.

17:44.267 --> 17:45.633
I don't, um...

17:45.667 --> 17:47.600
I don't want to be together
with anyone forever.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.667
-Is he more in love with you
than you are with him?

17:49.700 --> 17:51.033
-No no, not at all.

17:51.067 --> 17:53.733
Uh, I'm less capable
of love, maybe,

17:53.767 --> 17:55.667
but I am definitely
very into him.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.667
Do you-- do you
have a boyfriend?

17:57.700 --> 17:58.833
-No.

17:58.867 --> 18:01.600
-Have you ever been in love?

18:01.633 --> 18:04.400
-In high school, I was actually
in love with my best friend,

18:04.433 --> 18:07.167
Eddie, even though I was
convinced he was straight.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.300
One day he kissed me
and we started having sex.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.667
-Yes, hot!

18:10.700 --> 18:14.167
I've always regretted
not having gay sex
when I was a teenager.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.233
-Eddie would always say
that he wasn't gay.

18:16.267 --> 18:17.767
That he just
wanted to practice.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.467
-Mm.
-He wouldn't touch me

18:19.500 --> 18:21.633
outside of sex
for the first few weeks.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.267
-I mean, that is
the dream, isn't it?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.833
To have sex with Eddie
and then get all tortured

18:26.867 --> 18:28.300
that he doesn't love you back?

18:28.333 --> 18:31.067
-Mm, kind of.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.033
Gradually we got
closer and closer,

18:33.067 --> 18:36.700
and one night, at a party,
I was sucking his dick in a bed,

18:36.733 --> 18:37.700
then this--
-Whoo-whoo!

18:37.733 --> 18:39.500
-Yeah.
-Yeah, boy!

18:39.533 --> 18:41.400
-This dickhead--
-Whoo!

18:41.433 --> 18:43.033
-This dickhead guy--
-Yeah!

18:43.067 --> 18:45.233
-Okay. Walked in
and started shouting

18:45.267 --> 18:47.267
and telling everyone
to come and see.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.633
Eddie told everyone...

18:50.767 --> 18:53.767
that he was passed out
and that I raped him...

18:53.800 --> 18:56.267
which was unhelpful.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.667
We never spoke again.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.767
He committed suicide
when he was 19,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.400
and I didn't find that out
till three years later.

19:04.433 --> 19:07.667
But since your question was
"Have you ever been in love?"

19:07.700 --> 19:10.467
and not "Will you please tell me
a deeply horrific story?"

19:10.500 --> 19:12.300
I'll just answer
yes, I think so,

19:12.333 --> 19:14.000
to a boy in high school.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.600
-I don't know
what to say to that.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.233
-I've never told anyone that.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.267
-Why me?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.167
-I assume I'll never
see you again.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.433
-(phone vibrates)

19:30.667 --> 19:33.167
-Tell me something
you've never told anyone else.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.133
-In Year 5, I stole
my teacher's brooch.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.067
-Why?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.333
-For the rush of the crime.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.533
-What happened?

19:41.567 --> 19:43.767
-She told the whole class
that it was her dead mother's,

19:43.800 --> 19:46.467
and if the thief gave it back,
she would not be angry.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.633
-Did you give it back?

19:47.667 --> 19:49.400
-I buried it in the dirt.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.133
-You're a monster.
-Yes.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.367
-Wow.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.633
Now answer the question
like an adult.

19:54.667 --> 19:55.633
-Nope.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.267
-No, just run through
some things in your mind

19:57.300 --> 19:58.833
and when you get to a bit
that makes you go,

19:58.867 --> 20:01.767
"Oh, fuck," or makes you feel
weird in your-- in your tummy,

20:01.800 --> 20:03.100
tell me that.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.200
-Okay.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.733
I'm an only child, right?

20:12.767 --> 20:14.333
-Only child issues.
Of course.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.333
-No, listen. Thank you.

20:16.367 --> 20:18.333
So my-- my dad--
-Father issues? Is that it?

20:18.367 --> 20:20.033
-Will you stop
categorizing me, okay?

20:20.067 --> 20:21.133
I will not be categorized.

20:21.167 --> 20:24.767
-I'm sorry, you're an untamed
bouquet of emotion.

20:24.800 --> 20:29.400
-Well, so my dad is not very
good at communicating with me,

20:29.433 --> 20:32.133
so instead, he just
talks about chores...

20:32.167 --> 20:35.033
No, that's not a thing. No.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.500
-Well, is he a bad dad?

20:36.533 --> 20:39.200
-He-- he's a good dad.
-Did he ever hit you?

20:39.233 --> 20:41.700
-I mean, he is actually
just so lovely.

20:41.733 --> 20:44.633
-You are bad at this.
-Yeah.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.367
It's just it's complicated.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.667
I mean, like, I... I don't know
how to articulate it

20:48.700 --> 20:50.100
because anything
I would say about it,

20:50.133 --> 20:51.200
I would then disagree with.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.733
Okay, so... all right.

20:52.767 --> 20:54.567
So my dad broke up with my mum.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.667
Whatever.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.433
Uh, and then she became bipolar.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.600
Well, maybe she was
always bipolar.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.067
I don't really
understand that bit.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.433
And I definitely think
he made the right decision,

21:04.467 --> 21:11.167
but sometimes I accidentally
think my mum's mental illness

21:11.200 --> 21:13.267
is my Dad's fault.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.167
Ah, but I don't
actually think that.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.567
-I have a cerebral aneurysm.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.700
-Oh, fuck off.

21:19.733 --> 21:21.200
You really kept that
in your back pocket.

21:21.233 --> 21:22.267
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.067
But you should know that
I don't know what that is.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.600
Is it a bad thing?
Yeah. I'm guessing here.

21:25.633 --> 21:26.767
It's-- it's bad, yeah?

21:26.800 --> 21:27.900
-It's a bad thing, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:27.933 --> 21:30.433
-It's basically a weak spot
in an artery in my brain

21:30.467 --> 21:33.367
and I don't know,
it's not... precise science,

21:33.400 --> 21:35.233
but perhaps one day I could
be doing something

21:35.267 --> 21:38.200
and the aneurysm will
rupture and I'll die.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.667
-Yeah, that is a bad thing.
-Mm-hmm.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.667
-That is the worst thing.
-Yes.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.567
-Good evening.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.200
-Oh my God, Claire,.
You have to leave.

21:44.233 --> 21:49.567
-(laughs)
-Um, actually I can't,
for 15, 14, 13,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.767
12, 11...
-Josh: Claire, get out!

21:51.800 --> 21:58.733
ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four--

21:58.767 --> 22:00.300
-Three, two, one!

22:00.333 --> 22:03.433
-Two, one.
Fare thee well.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.567
-Fare thee well.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.333
Feel free to serial kill them,
by the way,

22:08.367 --> 22:09.967
if that is actually something
you actually enjoy doing.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.500
-No, I wouldn't want to take
an only child's friend so close
to Christmas, would I?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.333
-Okay, so...

22:15.367 --> 22:17.133
I-- I just really need
you to explain to me

22:17.167 --> 22:19.467
what you mean
by a weak spot in your artery.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.100
-I think "weak spot"
is quite clear.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.067
-Are you just so terrified?

22:25.100 --> 22:28.533
-When I turned up here
and saw you, I thought,

22:28.567 --> 22:31.167
"What if I die in his bed?
He'd have to meet my mum,"

22:31.200 --> 22:33.500
and I wondered
if my mum would
approve of you.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.467
-Yeah, I don't think
she would, to be honest.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.800
One time I put
peanut butter on my face
and let John lick it off, yeah.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.700
Not as a sex thing, thank you.

22:41.733 --> 22:44.500
It just made me giggle.

22:44.533 --> 22:47.233
Man, I would not have
been able to do that if I had
a "cerebal" aneurysm.

22:47.267 --> 22:49.333
-Cerebral.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.233
"Cerebal" is incorrect.

22:51.267 --> 22:53.167
See? My mum would
be so disappointed.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.233
-Yeah.

22:54.267 --> 22:56.833
Do you really want to be
wasting time on semantics?

22:56.867 --> 22:59.200
-No.

22:59.233 --> 23:00.300
-No.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.033
I'm not getting dressed

23:03.067 --> 23:04.267
as a hint for you
to leave, okay?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.733
I just have to sleep
with clothes on.

23:06.767 --> 23:08.833
That's why I'm getting dressed.

23:08.867 --> 23:10.233
-You started looking
at me weirdly ever since

23:10.267 --> 23:13.600
I told you my brain could
explode at any moment
and I might die.

23:13.633 --> 23:14.400
-Yeah.

23:14.433 --> 23:16.500
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I think that's fair.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.067
Good night.
-Yeah, so I'll leave
early in the morning.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.033
It was nice to meet you.
-It was nice to meet you.

23:36.067 --> 23:39.133
-Should I go to the mall?
-What do you want to do
at the mall?

23:39.167 --> 23:41.500
-I don't know. Just look around.

23:41.533 --> 23:44.500
Maybe buy something.
I could just not go, though.

23:44.533 --> 23:46.533
-Well, what would you do
if you don't go?

23:49.467 --> 23:51.367
-Probably get something to eat.

23:52.467 --> 23:53.533
-I don't know.
I could have a nap.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.567
I'm also quite tired.
What time do you come home?

23:56.600 --> 24:01.833
-3:00-ish.
-3:00-ish? I don't know.

24:01.867 --> 24:05.833
-Okay, well, what are the pros
and cons on going to the mall?

24:05.867 --> 24:09.400
-Okay. Pro...
it'd be fun to buy something.

24:09.433 --> 24:12.767
-Mm-hmm.
-Con, I just don't know
if I can be bothered.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.533
-Yeah, no, don't go to the mall.
-No, I won't go.

24:16.567 --> 24:19.167
-No.
-But, I'll go home, but not yet.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.533
I'll stay here for a bit.
-Okay, yeah.

24:21.567 --> 24:23.633
Good. Glad we had this chat.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.200
-Good meeting.
-Good meeting.

24:25.233 --> 24:29.200
-(music playing)
