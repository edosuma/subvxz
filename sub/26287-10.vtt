00:16.583 --> 00:20.087
PRIEST: Dear friends and family,
we've gathered here

00:20.087 --> 00:22.389
to witness and celebrate
the union

00:22.389 --> 00:25.092
of Andrew Simon
and Natalie Flynn

00:25.092 --> 00:27.327
in marriage.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.736
Stop the wedding.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.740
Cole

00:39.740 --> 00:41.208
I'm sorry, Natalie.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.342
I can't let you go
through with this.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.145
I told you, we should have
gotten married in Hawaii.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.246
Get out of here.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.348
Just hear me out.

00:50.117 --> 00:53.453
I know I'm not perfect,
but I love you.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.123
And I'm pretty sure
that you love me.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.491
Now, you have
two choices:

00:57.491 --> 01:00.260
you can play it safe
and marry Andrew,

01:00.260 --> 01:03.130
or you can listen
to your heart

01:03.130 --> 01:04.765
and drive off with me right now.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.166
In my car,

01:06.166 --> 01:08.368
because yours is pretty damaged.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.907
Did you really think
this would work?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.410
That you would
just barge in,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.179
profess your love,

01:19.179 --> 01:21.248
and we would kiss
and run off together?

01:22.316 --> 01:25.719
♪ Sometimes we brace ♪

01:25.719 --> 01:28.288
♪ And then fall ♪

01:28.288 --> 01:29.389
Well, this sucks.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.526
♪ Sometimes
we don't feel right ♪

01:32.526 --> 01:35.595
♪ Sometimes
we don't fall at all ♪

01:35.595 --> 01:37.197
Wake up, sleepyhead.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.465
:
♪ Thank you, my love... ♪

01:38.465 --> 01:40.400
Huh?

01:43.503 --> 01:45.439
Oh.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.375
:
Okay.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.313
I thought we'd have some more
fun before you left for work.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.282
Yeah. Let's have some more fun.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.185
Absolutely. Um...

01:58.185 --> 02:00.253
can I ask you a question?

02:00.253 --> 02:03.423
I'm Julie. We met
at a bar last night.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.526
That's not what
I was gonna ask you.
Oh.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.295
Are you a fan of pancakes,

02:08.295 --> 02:10.797
and if so,
do you have any pancake mix?

02:10.797 --> 02:14.301
Yes. To both.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.903
Good. Now back to your idea.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.844
Okay, I got this. I got...

02:23.844 --> 02:26.246
Oh.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.414
I don't have this.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.283
I'm gonna have to get
your Velcros.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.719
No, I understand. Thank you
so much. I appreciate the call.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.388
All right. Bye-bye.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.357
Oh. Harper's day care closed
for 24 hours.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.659
Measle outbreak.
Couldn't happen at a worse time.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.696
It's okay. We got this.
Right? We got this.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.731
We just call her
sitter, that's all.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.334
Honey, she's away.
Semester at Sea.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.602
So Roger,
I hate to say it,

02:48.602 --> 02:51.538
but one of us has to stay home
from work.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.940
Yeah, well, I just got
called to a crime scene.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.710
I can't. I...
Well, I have court in an hour.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.578
Uh...

02:58.578 --> 03:01.348
Oh, really

03:01.348 --> 03:03.316
What is that?
No, I-I'm just saying,

03:03.316 --> 03:07.354
is-is this courtroom drama
really life and death?

03:07.354 --> 03:10.390
Or is it someone trying to
weasel out of a speeding ticket?
You know,

03:10.390 --> 03:13.360
moving violation defense may not
be world-changing or lucrative,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.728
but it is how
a solo practitioner

03:14.728 --> 03:16.697
builds her practice.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.566
And your homicide victim

03:19.566 --> 03:21.902
isn't getting any deader.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.271
Wow.
I just...
You know I...

03:24.271 --> 03:26.373
I feel what you're
doing, and you know

03:26.373 --> 03:29.409
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay, I will call Cole

03:29.409 --> 03:31.978
and see if he can
stand in for me.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.713
I appreciate it.
It went to voice mail.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.716
He's been tough to reach
ever since Natalie got engaged.

03:36.716 --> 03:41.321
He's probably somewhere
balled up in a fetal position.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.996
Do you remember what I asked
you before we fell asleep?

03:51.631 --> 03:52.933
About the wedding?

03:53.867 --> 03:54.935
Yeah.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.003
Yeah. Right, of course.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.473
You don't have to
come. It's tonight,

03:59.473 --> 04:01.608
and it could be awful
'cause my ex will be there.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.076
Plus, I know we just met.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.511
Are we talking open bar?

04:04.511 --> 04:08.014
Open bar. Black tie,
the whole deal.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.749
So if it's not
your thing...

04:09.749 --> 04:12.018
I'm in. I love weddings.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.588
Oh! You're incredible.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.424
You're incredible.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.361
Oh.
Oh, my gosh.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.497
Are you okay?
Oh, my God.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.931
Here.
Oh, my God.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.868
She's gonna kill me.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.469
Who?
I don't live here.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.038
I'm house-sitting
for my college roommate.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.373
Erica's coming back today.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.375
She's super uptight.
She's a D.A.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.776
Did you say Erica?

04:36.776 --> 04:39.846
A D.A. named...
She really loved that table.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.381
Okay, it's a big
city. Common name.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.817
There's probably a long list
of D.A.s named Erica.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.752
Is her mom...
A senator.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.388
Her mom's a senator.
And that's a shorter list.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.458
She's early.
What?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.727
Wait, what are you doing?
It was really great

04:53.727 --> 04:56.663
to meet you, Julie. I'm gonna
go out your bathroom window now.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.731
Okay.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.068
Uh...
Hey, Jules.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.837
Caught an early flight.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.740
Yum, it smells like pancakes.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.847
Did someone just go out
the bathroom window?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.482
No.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.484
Uh... before you get upset,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.986
I really like this guy.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.388
Hmm.

05:26.860 --> 05:31.064
You have got to be kidding me.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.575
So, you dreamt
you broke up Natalie's wedding

05:41.575 --> 05:44.911
when in reality
you had just slept with Erica?

05:44.911 --> 05:46.513
No, I slept with
Erica's friend Julie

05:46.513 --> 05:49.549
in Erica's super nice house,
which Erica doesn't know about.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.185
Okay, and now you're going
to Natalie's wedding tonight?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.454
No, I'm going to
Julie's wedding.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.556
Sorry, Julie's
friend's wedding.

05:56.556 --> 05:59.459
One more time from the top?
No. I know enough

05:59.459 --> 06:01.461
about your soap opera life
already.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.064
Look, what is the
world coming to?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.599
Look at this.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.902
A weed truck
crashes into a carousel

06:08.902 --> 06:10.203
where children play.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.772
This stuff gets delivered
like pizza now.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.207
Weed and pizza.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.010
Now, that's a good business
idea. One-stop shop.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.045
Uh, Scorsese,

06:19.045 --> 06:20.080
what do we have here?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.882
Our victim's a 35-year-old
male. Kendal Green.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.884
Senior manager of
HerbLeaf, Incorporated.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.689
He operates this truck.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.626
So grisly.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.828
SCORSESE: And his carotid
artery was cut on both sides

06:34.828 --> 06:36.663
with a non-serrated blade,
like a...

06:36.663 --> 06:39.466
Garden shears.
Oh, a horticulturalist.

06:39.466 --> 06:42.102
Murtaugh, up top.
No.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.171
Uh, deep down,
I think you want to.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.606
That is his business
partner, Raymond.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.908
Just arrived.
And he's super stoned,

06:48.908 --> 06:50.644
so have fun with that.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.245
Raymond.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.847
Raymond.
We'd like to ask you

06:53.847 --> 06:56.549
a few questions.
Mm, get in line, Detective.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.585
Oh, crap.
The D.A.'s office

06:58.585 --> 07:00.654
has been fielding
a number of complaints

07:00.654 --> 07:02.255
against this company,
so we're gonna go first.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.257
I'd like to see
all your transactions

07:04.257 --> 07:05.659
for the past six months.
Don't say anything.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.593
RAYMOND:
No problem.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.962
They're, um, back in the office.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.598
We'll give you a ride.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.267
Oh, uh, Detective Cole,
I believe this belongs to you.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.537
Oh. Cool. Thank you.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.639
I took the $43 in cash
as a down payment

07:19.639 --> 07:21.207
towards my new kitchen table.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.576
Do you have anything to say?

07:25.845 --> 07:28.581
I hear you have a
very lovely kitchen.

on the battlefields of justice?
Nothing.

07:49.235 --> 07:53.173
Just appearance in front of...
Judge Leon.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.941
Ugh. Traffic court.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.743
Yeah.
Hey, it's a good place

07:56.743 --> 07:59.212
and smart move
bringing the bambino.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.213
Anyway,

08:00.213 --> 08:03.983
I've got to go.
I've got my class action lawsuit

08:03.983 --> 08:05.251
against Gehrman-Driscoll.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.854
Gehrman
Yeah.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.756
The Fortune 500
Gehrman
It turns out

08:09.756 --> 08:11.991
they have been putting
a very toxic chemical

08:11.991 --> 08:14.728
into some of their cleaning
supplies, as evidenced

08:14.728 --> 08:16.096
by my very sickly client
Preston here.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.997
Preston, put on the mask.
What are you doing?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.833
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.
What are...
You're killing me here.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.268
Anyway, good luck
with the double parkers.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.504
Bye, Harper.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.607
Like Abraham Lincoln,

08:27.607 --> 08:30.877
I have less than one year
of formal schooling.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.614
But I shall prove
that Gehrman-Driscoll

08:34.614 --> 08:36.983
acted with malice

08:36.983 --> 08:41.121
and reckless disregard
for human life.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.356
And furthermore...
Your Honor, I move

08:43.356 --> 08:44.691
you put an end
to this farce right now

08:44.691 --> 08:47.861
by failing to certify
Mr. Getz's class

08:47.861 --> 08:49.195
of barely
half a dozen plaintiffs.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.697
I object.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.232
On what grounds, Mr. Getz?

08:55.301 --> 08:58.071
On many fertile,
hallowed grounds.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.372
The halls...

08:59.372 --> 09:00.907
of justice.

I don't know what this is.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.922
The public policy clause

09:15.922 --> 09:18.191
in the California Code
of Civil Procedure,

09:18.191 --> 09:20.160
statute 382.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.095
What she said. That.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.230
Objection sustained.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.805
My, uh, my co-counsel.

like cheap cologne,

09:43.817 --> 09:45.752
along with everything
that your drunk hands

09:45.752 --> 09:47.120
and God knows what else
touched last night.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.254
COLE:
Well, I definitely didn't go

09:48.254 --> 09:49.255
anywhere near your clothes.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.723
You wore my robe.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.760
Okay, God. Please,
stop. Both of you.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.727
I don't want to know
what happened last night.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.897
Just answer me this:
do I need to call HR?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.199
No.
We're good.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.667
Okay. Good. So, tell me

10:00.667 --> 10:02.035
about the murder
at the cannabis truck.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.403
The owners have been
on the D.A.'s radar

10:03.403 --> 10:04.671
for the past few weeks.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.706
Their products have been sending
their customers to the hospital.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.274
COLE:
Someone sent Kendal Green

10:08.274 --> 10:10.844
right to the morgue. My money's
on his previous employer.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.779
Green Harvest?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.247
We all have areas of expertise.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.082
Mine happens to be weed dealers.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.985

10:20.787 --> 10:22.388
tried to sue him
for unshared revenue.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.790
There were threatening texts.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.726
Hey, look. It's a motive.
Go talk to them.

Cole.

20:25.791 --> 20:26.926
No.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.962
Hey.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.964
I was just
gonna call you.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.365
Good news. Flight got cancelled.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.267
I can make the wedding.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.604
I'd like you to tell my husband
to stop deposing me

20:38.604 --> 20:40.873
as a witness.
And I'd like you
to tell my wife

20:40.873 --> 20:44.543
not to walk into situations
that could get her killed.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.578
Okay, time-out.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.980
Catching up here.
So, Tom Kessler is no longer

20:47.980 --> 20:49.215
a suspect
in the Kendal Green murder?

20:49.215 --> 20:54.487
Correct. We think whoever killed
Kendal just tried to kill Tom.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.955
Tom is a whistleblower
in a lawsuit...

20:55.955 --> 20:57.790
BOTH:
Against Gehrman-Driscoll.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.593
You're just gonna talk about
my lawsuit like I'm not here.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.362
It is my whistleblower,
it's my case.
AVERY: Hold on.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.563
How are your case
and our murder connected?

21:04.563 --> 21:06.432
BOTH: That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.834
Will you please tell him...?
Will you tell my wife to listen?

21:08.834 --> 21:09.835
No, you listen.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.103
I have an idea.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.371
Why don't you two get
through this,

21:12.371 --> 21:13.572
and I'll be where you are not.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.779
I don't get it.
You don't want me to do my job?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.580
Finding people

21:21.580 --> 21:24.550
who are trying to kill other
people is not your job.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.986
Except now, it is. This is
an important case, Roger.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.356
A big case.
I get it.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.390
What do you get?

21:31.390 --> 21:33.726
Traffic court, misdemeanors.

21:33.726 --> 21:37.663
Things aren't happening as
fast as you would like them to,

21:37.663 --> 21:40.533
and you think this is
gonna help launch your career.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.468
Hmm.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.604
What if you get
killed pursuing that?

21:45.604 --> 21:49.542
You think you know
what's inside my head, Roger?

21:49.542 --> 21:52.378
Almost never.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.555
WOMAN:
Hi.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.722
Hi.
May I help you?

22:03.722 --> 22:06.959
Yeah, I'm actually here to pick
up a dress for my friend.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.761
She's a bridesmaid
at a wedding tonight.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.095
Name of the wedding?

22:10.095 --> 22:12.164
I'm not sure.
Her name's Julie.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.934
Last name?
Not sure.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.069
She's, like, five-six,

22:17.069 --> 22:18.837
reddish hair.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.172
Five-six.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.408
I'll see what I can find.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.043
Thank you.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.946
NATALIE:
These things are not easy

22:26.946 --> 22:28.514
to get into.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.416
Okay, here I come.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.419

WOMAN:
You are stunning.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.126
Is it a "yes"?
Is this the dress?
Yes!

22:41.126 --> 22:42.995
Are we saying "yes"
to the dress?

22:42.995 --> 22:45.598
I personally love it.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.800
It's very sparkly.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.071
Cole... what are
you doing here?

22:52.071 --> 22:54.673
I'm here to pick up
my date's dress

22:54.673 --> 22:56.675
for this wedding
that we're going to tonight.

22:56.675 --> 22:59.011
Oh. Really?
Yeah.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.012
Whose wedding?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.481
Just some friends of Julie's.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.583
That's my date. Julie.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.718
She's amazing.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.621
Hmm.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.522
Sir, I'm not finding anything.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.458
Do you happen to have
her phone number?

23:12.458 --> 23:13.759
We don't typically
save information

23:13.759 --> 23:15.027
under height
or hair color.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.496
I wish I did.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.466
Julie's kind of a new friend.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.004
Going to a wedding of
someone you don't know

23:25.004 --> 23:27.906
with a girl
you just met.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.509
Same old Cole.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.912
Yeah. Who doesn't love that guy?

AVERY:
Any sign of Kessler?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.763
Two hours in,

23:50.763 --> 23:51.897
and still no.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.666
And what course are you up to?

23:53.666 --> 23:54.933
Appetizers.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.903
I'm doing a crudités plate.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.171
Following it with a...

23:59.171 --> 24:01.540
pasta and spicy a-meatballs.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.609
Oh, God, I miss your stakeouts.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.784
You got to be kidding me.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.786
Oh, no. Bad crudités?

24:13.786 --> 24:15.220
It's Trish.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.657
On her own stakeout.
Oh, my goodness.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.659
She doesn't know
what she's even doing.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.262
She has no provisions,
no neck pillow.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.264
It's pure amateur hour.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.965
I'll call you back.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.038
Hey, sweetie. What's up?

24:33.038 --> 24:34.106
I see you.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.140
What?

24:35.140 --> 24:36.175
Putting aside

24:36.175 --> 24:38.977
the fact that you're back
in the line of fire

24:38.977 --> 24:40.713
against my advice,

24:40.713 --> 24:42.614
what you see is

24:42.614 --> 24:44.683
a professional stakeout...

24:44.683 --> 24:45.617
Mm.

24:45.617 --> 24:48.253
...with all
the necessary accoutrements.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.623
Neck support, I got food.

24:51.623 --> 24:52.624
Meatballs.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.694
They looked very spicy, Roger.
Oh, they are.

24:55.694 --> 24:59.832
But not to worry, because I will
be washing them down with...

24:59.832 --> 25:02.267
Wait a minute.

25:03.702 --> 25:04.803
Where is...?

25:04.803 --> 25:06.572
Where is my...?

25:07.973 --> 25:11.677
My stakeout thermos.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.513
And I've got three more
just like 'em.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.852
But I'm willing to negotiate.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.959
You could have got
yourself hurt today.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.061
I know.

25:29.061 --> 25:33.632
And I'm sorry that I thought
this was all about your career.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.001
Thank you.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.237
You weren't wrong.
I know.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.872
Okay.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.776
What are you doing?

25:43.776 --> 25:45.711
I'm adding a whole
new accoutrement.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.614
There is no way, baby.
No. Listen.

25:48.614 --> 25:52.851
We can't make up and
then skip the best part.
Honey.

25:52.851 --> 25:55.053
You know garlic and
meat make me horny.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.759
I-I think I see someone.
It's me.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.061
It's me.
No. Honey, no.
I think it's Tom.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.931
I think it's Tom.

26:05.931 --> 26:08.834
MURTAUGH:
Tom Kessler.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.837
The whistleblower
with terrible timing.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.751
You're an hour late.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.787
I told Julie
to leave without you.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.256
Hey. You look great.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.027
Your place looks great.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.696
Didn't there used
to be a table there?

26:37.696 --> 26:39.231
And you're drunk.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.666
Yeah, I am.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.767
I didn't get Julie's dress,

26:41.767 --> 26:45.838
but I did see
what Natalie was wearing

26:45.838 --> 26:48.040
for her wedding day,
and she looked

26:48.040 --> 26:50.442
a lot like Meghan
Merkel. Or Markle.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.711
Mackerel. Something
with an "E-L."

26:52.711 --> 26:54.146
I don't know.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.948
Crap.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.783
Are you okay?

26:57.783 --> 26:59.885
Yeah, I'm... I'm
always okay.

27:01.753 --> 27:06.325
All the tortures I endured,
the waterboarding,

27:06.325 --> 27:09.862
the fingernails, the
sleep deprivation...

27:09.862 --> 27:11.797
This one.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.271
When they rip your heart out,

27:19.271 --> 27:22.941
it's like a whole new world
of pain.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.412
Yeah, I've heard.

27:27.412 --> 27:30.415
That's why I avoided
it my entire life.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.284
But you know what?

27:32.284 --> 27:34.319
It's a bad idea.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.321
Because now...

27:36.321 --> 27:40.425
there's no scar tissue there,

27:40.425 --> 27:44.730
and it just... hurts.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.774
How long does it take
to go away?

28:00.779 --> 28:02.814
I don't know, Cole.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.818
But I'm sorry.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.794
Did you and Julie have sex
on this couch?

28:17.095 --> 28:18.931
No.
Oh.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.066
Maybe.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.001
:
All right.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.888
This blanket is almost
as comfy as your robe.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.623
I will dump this on you.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.926
How weird did things get
last night? Be honest.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.895
Let's see.
You came in drunk.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.631
You threatened to puke in my
bathroom, talked about torture,

28:52.631 --> 28:54.866
your ex, and then
you followed through

28:54.866 --> 28:56.468
on your original threat.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.136
It is a great bathroom.
And...

28:58.136 --> 28:59.638
you tried to call your ex

28:59.638 --> 29:01.106
a few times last night,
so I took your phone.

29:01.106 --> 29:04.176
I would have wanted someone
to do the same for me.
Sorry.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.479
I guess I owe you one.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.914
It's fine.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.916
It was... humanizing.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.119
If the whole thing wasn't so
graphic, it might have been...

29:14.119 --> 29:16.021
COLE:
Six missed calls from Roger.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.656
They have Tom Kessler.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.424
We got to go.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.527
You don't have that sweatshirt

29:22.527 --> 29:23.895
that I left here
the other night, do you?

29:23.895 --> 29:24.997
I used it to clean the bathroom.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.164
That's fair.
Mm-hmm.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.070
I told them they were using
dangerous levels of triclosan.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.606
I sent memos.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.608
But they didn't
want to hear it.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.210
That's when
the threats started.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.046
What? We've been here
the whole time.

29:41.046 --> 29:43.615
In that outfit,
I would've noticed.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.284
So Gehrman-Driscoll's trying
to kill you to shut you up?

29:46.284 --> 29:48.687
And not just me. There's a guy
who works at a cannabis farm,

29:48.687 --> 29:52.024
found out Gehrman-Driscoll's
fertilizer made him sick.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.092
A cannabis farm.
Kendal Green?

29:54.092 --> 29:55.794
Yeah, that's him.
We were in touch

29:55.794 --> 29:57.295
for a while 'cause
he wanted to go public.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.197
And then,
I stopped hearing from him.

29:59.197 --> 30:00.966
He got killed two days ago.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.101
Oh, God.

30:03.101 --> 30:04.569
That's what they do.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.271
Well, I see 'em in
court in an hour.

30:06.271 --> 30:07.272
Do you have any
hard evidence?

30:07.272 --> 30:10.709
I made copies of everything.
I have a whole file.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.244
But I couldn't get it
out of Gehrman-Driscoll.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.545
They were watching.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.782
It's behind a vent in my office.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.650
That shouldn't be a problem.
Right, Roger?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.118
Piece of cake. We'll just
go by there and get it.

30:20.118 --> 30:21.853
Not without a warrant, you
won't, unless you want

30:21.853 --> 30:23.655
to kill our case and your
wife's, in one fell swoop.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.258
Warrant, Roger.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.793
How quickly
can you get us one?

30:27.793 --> 30:31.129
Well, if I can get
an emergency hearing,

30:31.129 --> 30:32.264
put Tom in front
of a judge,

30:32.264 --> 30:34.032
maybe an hour, but...
Great.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.200
I left my case files
on this at home,

30:35.200 --> 30:36.668
so we'll have to
make a quick stop.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.670
Take a uni with you to be safe.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.239
Oh, that's sweet.
You're worried about me.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.608
Well, Tom.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.611
And you. It's a 50/50 thing.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.747
Mostly Tom, though.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.248
Tom.

30:50.248 --> 30:51.750
:
What's happening?

30:51.750 --> 30:53.685
HR nightmare.

30:57.089 --> 31:00.659
Hey, could you call Erica and
ask her what's taking so long

31:00.659 --> 31:02.627
with this warrant?
I just called her. You call her.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.796
Trish is waiting for these
documents in court.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.631
Her whole case
is riding on this.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.667
And I imposed on Erica
way too much this week.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.305
Kessler sent two cops
to search this office.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.740
Find the files.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.111
Sorry, this'll just be
a few minutes.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.013
There's some coffee
in the kitchen if you want it.

31:22.013 --> 31:23.315
No. No. I'm okay.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.784
Thanks.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.120
So what happens in
the judge's chambers?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.655
I don't have to see anyone from
Gehrman

31:30.655 --> 31:32.724
Oh, don't worry.
We go in ex parte.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.326
It'll all be in the affidavit.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.660
How they threatened your life.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.763
Tried to gun you down in public.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.097
Murdered Kendal Green.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.866
With a pair of gardening shears.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.768
Brutal.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.937
How did you know about
the gardening shears?

31:45.937 --> 31:47.739
I heard it on the news.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.676
Huh. I didn't know we released
those details.

31:53.745 --> 31:58.016
Oh. I overheard someone
at the police station.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.721
I think I will have that coffee.

32:09.694 --> 32:10.862
Hey.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.698
COLE: How we looking
on that warrant?

32:13.698 --> 32:15.100
It's coming along.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.434
Any minute.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.236
Any minute, is that one minute,
ten minutes?

32:18.236 --> 32:20.839
What are we looking at?
Cole...

32:20.839 --> 32:23.842
There's something off about Tom.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.779
Erica, you there?

32:27.779 --> 32:28.914
Hang up the phone.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.090
My wife worked in the
Gehrman-Driscoll labs

32:39.090 --> 32:40.926
for 20 years and got sick
because of it.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.461
Their reaction?

32:43.461 --> 32:45.530
Deny responsibility.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.065
And refuse to pay
her medical bill.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.067
These people are monsters!

32:51.703 --> 32:53.605
I need your bike.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.073
LAPD.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.441
Thank you.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.013
Screw that damn warrant.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.402
Hey!

33:24.402 --> 33:25.704
LAPD! Drop the file.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.772
Now.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.857
Where is Rog
with the files?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.058
Your Honor,

33:47.058 --> 33:50.662
the prosecution has yet to
produce any evidence supporting

33:50.662 --> 33:53.465
their reckless accusations,
despite their promises to do so.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.466
I agree.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.802
Counselor, if you have
something else to add,

33:57.802 --> 33:59.604
now is the time.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.941
Just one moment,
Your Honor.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.944
: I need you to stall
until Roger gets here.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.780
This is what I do.
Watch.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.582
Your Honor!

34:12.951 --> 34:17.689
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother, Ice Queen.

34:17.689 --> 34:21.826
Until I was 28 years old,
I could not read.

34:21.826 --> 34:25.063
So I would look at that seal
of the City of Los Angeles

34:25.063 --> 34:28.166
and have to go off of the bear.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.135
And the oil rig.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.708
Counselor?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.578
:
Sorry. It's my asthma.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.615
I'll be fine.

35:06.071 --> 35:08.940
Thank you, Preston.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.076
Your Honor, this charade
has gone on long enough.
LEO: I...

35:11.076 --> 35:12.677
was nowhere near done.
JUDGE: I agree.

35:12.677 --> 35:13.712
Counselor, your time is up.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.680
Just one minute, Your Honor,
we're not finished.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.551
Counselor, present something
in two minutes

35:19.551 --> 35:22.220
or I will hold you both
in contempt

35:22.220 --> 35:23.922
and recommend disbarment,
is that clear?

35:23.922 --> 35:26.191
Understood,
Your Honor.

35:26.191 --> 35:29.794
I cannot lose my license
for a third time.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.765
I sabotaged their product

35:33.765 --> 35:37.068
to take away the only thing
that matters to them, money.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.803
When they found out-- ha--

35:38.803 --> 35:42.941
there was no warning made
to the public.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.576
They tried to cover it up
by killing me.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.544
Did you kill Kendal Green?

35:46.544 --> 35:49.881
After he got sick, he started
snooping around Gehrman-Driscoll

35:49.881 --> 35:52.150
and found me.

35:52.150 --> 35:56.187
Like you, he left me no choice.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.962
We will be proving,

36:03.962 --> 36:06.798
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

36:06.798 --> 36:09.267
the Gehrman-Driscoll...

36:34.726 --> 36:37.696
Remember when you were so upset
about that table?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.802
PRESTON:
I'm thankful for justice.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.671
Plus, I pledge to donate
the $20 million

36:46.671 --> 36:50.308
from Gehrman-Driscoll to the
American Cancer Society.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.277
And my legal team
has generously agreed

36:52.277 --> 36:54.379
to forfeit their salaries
as well.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.447
LEO :
No!

36:55.447 --> 36:56.448
That was me.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.449
Yeah. We figured.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.516
Cheer up, Leo, we won.

36:58.516 --> 36:59.684
Oh, yeah?

36:59.684 --> 37:02.554
'Cause it feels a lot like the
American Cancer Society won.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.657
Did you know that there are many
semi-reputable charities

37:05.657 --> 37:07.759
that will give you an
under

37:07.759 --> 37:08.993
All you had to do
was check with me.

37:08.993 --> 37:11.763
Listen, Tom Kessler and three
Gehrman-Driscoll executives

37:11.763 --> 37:14.332
are going to jail because of
you, Leo. Justice was served.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.000
Justice doesn't pay
for this fancy suit.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.869
Oh, that's...
Okay, I'll see you later.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.338
Or my other fancy suit.
L.A.'s expensive, Cappy.
Oh, yeah.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.340
Well,
I don't know about you,

37:22.340 --> 37:25.009
but I've gotten several calls
from potential clients

37:25.009 --> 37:26.778
since news of
this trial broke.

37:26.778 --> 37:27.912
Really?
Mm-hmm.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.013
I haven't gotten any.

37:29.013 --> 37:31.783
Well, is it possible you
didn't pay your phone bill?

37:31.783 --> 37:34.385
Well, no. I bought 15 minutes
last week, I should be--

37:34.385 --> 37:37.088
Oh. No. I'm out.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.357
You know what? We would not have
these kind of problems

37:39.357 --> 37:41.793
if you and me
were partners.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.362
Not a chance.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.797
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding?

37:45.797 --> 37:47.365
My asthma attack saved us.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.534
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
Plus, I got

37:49.534 --> 37:51.369
a lot of ailments
you haven't even seen yet.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.705
I have a really interesting
rash that's real.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.640
You should see
my eye patch.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.343
I do a pretty good
limp. I do...

38:07.385 --> 38:08.820

Here.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.456
You left that
in my apartment.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.590
What is it?

38:12.590 --> 38:15.426
A piece of your motorcycle that
I found under my couch.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.530
So I hear that
you're moving.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.999
Yeah. After being held
at knifepoint,

38:20.999 --> 38:22.600
witnessing a murder,
and the fact

38:22.600 --> 38:25.537
that you had sex in it
kind of killed the vibe.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.473
