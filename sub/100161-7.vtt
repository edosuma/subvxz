00:07.560 --> 00:09.259
Previously, on Ray Donovan...

Look familiar?

00:19.850 --> 00:22.179
There, yeah. You had enough?

00:23.232 --> 00:25.279
- Who the fuck was it?

O'Malley. O'Malley.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.994
I taped every fuckin' thing
Jimmy ever said to me.

00:35.995 --> 00:38.371
_

01:07.234 --> 01:09.319
The shit on this tape is unbelievable.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.363
Jimmy Sullivan'll give
us anything we want.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.377
Here to pick up a credit card.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.172
Sandy... Patrick?

01:29.173 --> 01:32.959
Me, O'Malley, and Doyle,
we did this job, uh,

01:32.960 --> 01:34.385
back in '77.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.719
You know who else was on that job?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.079
Your father.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.719
- Mickey?
- Hey, baby.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.879
Oh, my God!

01:40.880 --> 01:42.079
- It's so good to see you!
- How are you?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.645
Good to see you too.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.980
- Muah! Take care of yourself!

Ray.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.170
Ray.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.090

05:09.810 --> 05:11.599

05:11.600 --> 05:14.480
Well, uh... I'll come up.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.276
No, you won't. Why are
you taking her money?

05:18.620 --> 05:20.695
It's an investment opportunity, Ray-Ray.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.198
Don't worry about it.

05:30.780 --> 05:33.719
Oh, come on.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.794
Looking so serious, huh?

05:37.140 --> 05:38.800
Go back to bed.

05:45.630 --> 05:48.170
It's gonna be fine, Ray-Ray.

05:57.850 --> 06:00.399
... booted off the fucking
rail in the fifth round,

06:00.400 --> 06:02.059
was what happened, and he came back...

06:02.060 --> 06:04.879
- Mick.
- That's what he's supposed to do.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.759
Hey, Jimmy.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.121

06:11.122 --> 06:13.539

06:20.800 --> 06:23.169

06:28.760 --> 06:30.719

06:30.720 --> 06:33.559
Ted, you callin' me a liar?

06:33.560 --> 06:36.059
Thank you. Put it on my tab, huh?

06:36.060 --> 06:37.849

06:50.740 --> 06:52.449
Ohh...

06:52.450 --> 06:53.799
Count it.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.623
Jesus, fuck. Just tell me.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.001
A grand.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.504
You owe me five.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.216
I know.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.769
One out of five. Those are, um...

07:07.770 --> 07:09.429
those are Denny Doyle numbers.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.319
- What?
- See, Denny Doyle,

07:11.320 --> 07:12.659
he's battin' 200.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.640
Now, you think he's gonna
start again next year

07:14.650 --> 07:17.469
- for the Sox?
- I don't fuckin' know.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.855
Well, I got a fuckin' crystal ball.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.059
You see, Denny Doyle's not
only not suitin' up next year

07:23.060 --> 07:25.079
for the Sox, he's not suitin' up

07:25.080 --> 07:27.779
for any fuckin' MLB team next year.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.679
Do you know why?

07:29.680 --> 07:32.989
- No.
- Well, because, like you,

07:32.990 --> 07:34.412
he's a one out of five guy.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.789
Been a one out of five guy
for nearly ten years.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.249
After a while, you know, people...

07:40.250 --> 07:42.586
they start losin' hope, you know?

07:42.587 --> 07:46.289
Denny Doyle's always gonna hit 200.

07:46.290 --> 07:49.169
And the management, well...

07:49.170 --> 07:51.388
We don't like those kinda numbers.

07:51.389 --> 07:54.766
Why don't you, uh,
gimme your coke money.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.639
Uh... what are you talkin' about?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.769
Jesus Christ, you fuckin' cunt.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.199
Gimme that money you took in today

08:03.200 --> 08:05.942
from that bullshit fuckin' coke
you sell those poor girls.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.739
I swear to God,

08:07.740 --> 08:09.609
you're better off deliverin'
it to the Laundromat

08:09.610 --> 08:12.159
and washin' your...
your delicates with it.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.699
Ah...

08:15.700 --> 08:17.869
All right.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.959
Here.

08:24.620 --> 08:25.959
Gimme your gun.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.382
- What?
- Your gun.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.419
Otherwise, look... I don't wanna do it,

08:31.420 --> 08:33.549
but you see Mark and Arty over there?

08:33.549 --> 08:36.039
Well, they're probably gonna come
to your house later tonight.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.849
They might break a few ribs.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.311
Maybe your fingers too.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.729
Oh.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.239
Mark my words, Mick,

08:52.240 --> 08:57.219
Denny Doyle will be sellin'
used cars by Christmas.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.319
Boys, let's go.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.079
- Jimmy, listen...
- Fuck off.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.780
Sorry.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.769
Mister?

09:53.770 --> 09:55.799
Maybe just check.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.350
Hey. Hey, you okay?

10:11.180 --> 10:14.156
Let me help you, sweetheart.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.070
You sure?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.454
Easy.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.289
Yeah.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.699
Jimmy fuckin' Sullivan.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.539
Who's this?

10:28.540 --> 10:31.640
Just an old friend from
the neighborhood, Jimmy.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.549
An old friend who's thinkin'

10:33.550 --> 10:37.344
maybe you wanna... buy some tapes.

10:40.650 --> 10:43.139
Fine, motherfucker. Tell
me where to meet you.

11:20.090 --> 11:23.057
- Ray?
- I need to find your father.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.475
He's not pickin' up his phone.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.779
- What's going on?
- It's important, Molly.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.020
Please.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.599
Well, his driver always
knows where he is.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.150
Hold on.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.379
You can go home now, Roberto.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.679
You sure, Mr. Sullivan?

11:45.680 --> 11:47.039
Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.380
Yeah, I'm sure.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.080
A couple weeks ago,

12:33.090 --> 12:36.139
Doyle here comes whinin' to me

12:36.140 --> 12:39.549
that he's got a job all the
way down to the Philly mint.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.379
But I think...

12:41.380 --> 12:43.299
"A fuckin' mint!"

12:43.300 --> 12:45.279
So pay a few jokers off.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.079
Turns out, they got these, uh,

12:48.080 --> 12:51.104
fuckin' gold coins they
minted for the Bicentennial.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.859
Each worth near a thousand dollars

12:53.860 --> 12:56.199
they're just gonna... melt down.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.729
So I tell Doyle here

12:58.730 --> 13:01.069
he's about to have the biggest
fuckin' score of his life

13:01.070 --> 13:02.309
three feet from his asshole!

13:03.630 --> 13:05.819
And me and my partner,
we drive 'em down next week.

13:05.820 --> 13:08.529
Now, if a couple of guys
were to blow out our tires,

13:08.530 --> 13:10.029
take us unawares...

13:10.030 --> 13:12.149
- Who's in the truck with you?
- Colin Rooney.

13:12.150 --> 13:14.119
Colin Rooney. He ain't in on it.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.640
We gotta take care of him quick,

13:15.650 --> 13:17.499
maybe, uh, what, shoot him in the leg?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.579
- I don't know, somethin' like that.
- No, no,

13:18.580 --> 13:20.841
he's one of these, you
know, hemo-philiactics.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.299
- The fuck is that?
- Well, he'll bleed to death.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.279
You know, just give him a
good beatin', and me too.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.388
Oh, it'd be my pleasure.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.799
Hey, hey, hey.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.809
It's gotta be the real
shit, though. All right?

13:29.810 --> 13:32.340
Broken bones.

13:32.350 --> 13:35.419
And then, before the cops
and the ambulances arrive,

13:35.420 --> 13:37.619
me and the truck, well...

13:37.620 --> 13:40.620
we're in the fuckin' wind.

13:42.340 --> 13:43.840
Oh, sure.

13:51.620 --> 13:55.040
Hey. I got some good news.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.961

13:58.000 --> 13:59.930

14:20.150 --> 14:22.099
I mean, is it okay with you?

14:22.100 --> 14:24.149
What... what about you, little man?

14:24.150 --> 14:26.160

Go fuck yourself, Mickey!

17:44.890 --> 17:47.065
Last time... drop the gun!

17:47.066 --> 17:49.235
- Don't be stupid. Get on the ground!
- Drop it!

17:49.236 --> 17:50.519
- Now!
- Drop the gun!

17:50.520 --> 17:51.859
Drop it!

17:54.110 --> 17:55.283
Move in!

17:56.900 --> 17:58.368
I got you covered, O'Malley.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.829
Fuck you, O'Malley.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.250
You look pretty good for a
man who burned to death.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.539
You look like shit for a rich fuck.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.409
Well, that's 'cause I
didn't have the benefit

18:13.410 --> 18:14.879
of havin' my face moisturized

18:14.880 --> 18:17.889
by convicts comin' on it day and night.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.139
Sandy.

18:22.140 --> 18:25.019
Yeah.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.390
You're the spittin' image
of your grandfather.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.520
Fuck you, Jim.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.110
Who do we have over here?

18:35.360 --> 18:37.400
Aw, jeez.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.169
It's your half-breed, right?

18:40.170 --> 18:41.953
It's Claudette's kid.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.957
Wow. All grown up.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.669
Stupid fuck.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.921
Always told you to keep
your pecker in your pants,

18:50.922 --> 18:52.260
and you never listen.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.839
And now, look what you got over there.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.919
What's that supposed to mean?

18:56.920 --> 18:58.419
Means I want you to come over here

18:58.420 --> 19:00.960
and shine my fuckin' shoes.

19:01.960 --> 19:05.150
This guy.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.689
You always had the knack of saying

19:07.690 --> 19:09.239
the nastiest fuckin' things.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.439
Mick, I'm not... I'm not as patient

19:11.440 --> 19:12.679
as I was when we were kids,

19:12.680 --> 19:15.445
so spare me all the
fuckin' Donovan gobshite.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.529
What you're doin' now, Jimmy,

19:17.530 --> 19:19.825
is laborin' under a misapprehension.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.411
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

19:21.412 --> 19:24.020
You think you're talkin'
to the person I was.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.417
But that man is dead.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.079
He didn't die easy, Jim.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.699
Came in parts.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.789
But it all started with the heist,

19:34.790 --> 19:37.509
when the heist went bad and
you set me up for prison.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.669
You were a pain in the ass, all right?

19:39.670 --> 19:41.719
You were always fuckin' up jobs.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.059
I did everybody a favor

19:43.060 --> 19:45.459
gettin' your, uh, loser
ass off the street.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.849
When I come back home,

19:47.850 --> 19:51.679
my poor wife is dead, my boy hates me.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.740
My sweet little girl
jumped to her death.

19:56.110 --> 19:58.479
All my dreams fucked.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.799
But that pain did to me

20:01.800 --> 20:03.620
what flame does to wood...

20:03.630 --> 20:06.539
everything unnecessary burned away.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.829
And what's left, Jimmy,

20:10.830 --> 20:13.546
is hardened.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.150
What are you doin' here?

20:42.530 --> 20:44.243
Did he tell you who he's meetin' with?

20:44.244 --> 20:45.249
No.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.704
- Did he take anybody in with him?
- No.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.920
Shit.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.139

20:53.140 --> 20:54.670

I think so.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.959
- I'm calling the police.
- You can't do that, Molly.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.899
Three people have been murdered.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.359
I know.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.359
Why did you say your father was dead?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.609
- Molly...
- You fucking lied.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.787
Molly, please. Wait.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.909
- It's not what you think.
- I'm calling the police.

24:17.910 --> 24:20.779
If you do that, your father
will be dead by the morning.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.539
I'm sorry I lied to you.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.099
But if you wanna get your father back,

24:24.100 --> 24:25.755
you gotta trust me.

24:51.610 --> 24:54.239
You... you were in there a long time.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.259
Yeah.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.831
What did she ask you?

24:59.830 --> 25:02.619
About those cops. Ha.

25:02.620 --> 25:05.463
She was all about those cops.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.009
What... what'd you tell her?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.879
Just told her the same fuckin' thing,

25:12.880 --> 25:15.359
that we were at the Jonathan
Walker Hanson concert

25:15.360 --> 25:18.719
and, you know, the next day
we went and got married.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.239
Did... did you tell her
that I was with you

25:20.240 --> 25:21.312
at the marriage bureau?

25:21.313 --> 25:23.019
Yeah.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.100
Good.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.739
I hope she contacts me.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.734
Tell you how this is gonna work.

25:30.735 --> 25:32.659
Sandy's gonna sit with the tapes,

25:32.660 --> 25:34.992
and you're gonna get 'em back
soon as we come to terms.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.319
Terms? Fuck you, Mick.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.869
You're gonna make it right, Jimmy.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.239
I-I don't know about you, you know,

25:40.240 --> 25:42.819
but I-I only travel forward in time.

25:42.820 --> 25:44.459
If I'd gotten my fair share,

25:44.460 --> 25:46.377
I'd be the billionaire now.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.499
I didn't take that gold,
plant it in the ground,

25:48.500 --> 25:52.139
grow a goddamn tree that
grew apples made of money.

25:52.140 --> 25:55.039
I worked. I worked my ass off every day

25:55.040 --> 25:56.179
to build what I built.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.359
You don't know the man I'd be
if you hadn't fucked me over.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.759
Sandy, take off.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.429
You don't hear from me in two hours,

26:02.430 --> 26:03.938
call the Globe and send 'em the tapes.

26:03.939 --> 26:06.460
Actually, I hope I don't hear from you.

26:06.470 --> 26:08.859
Go fuck yourselves.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.229
Why'd you do it, Jimmy? For what?

26:11.230 --> 26:13.229
Was it jealousy?

26:13.230 --> 26:14.859
Jealousy. That sounds right.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.620
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

26:16.630 --> 26:18.661
You tried to steal from me, Mick.

26:18.662 --> 26:20.679
Do a job with my men.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.331
Rip off, uh, trucks
that I had a deal with?

26:23.332 --> 26:27.119
Huh? And then not cut me
in on fuckin' anything?

26:27.120 --> 26:30.389
You got exactly what
you had comin' to you,

26:30.390 --> 26:33.220
you fuckin' deluded fuck.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.879
But I'll...

26:38.880 --> 26:40.839
I'll give you a million.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.559
I'll give you a million
bucks in cash tonight.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.560
- A million?
- What'd you say... a million?

26:46.564 --> 26:48.639
- Yeah, that's right.
- Fuck you.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.819
No, no, no, wait a minute, Pop.

26:49.820 --> 26:52.360
Stay out of this, son.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.279
One out of what, a billion?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.760
The gold itself is worth...

26:57.770 --> 26:59.019
near 20.

26:59.020 --> 27:01.449
And that was 40 fuckin' years ago.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.199
And what with compounded interest on...

27:03.200 --> 27:04.498
on that a-fuckin'-lone...

27:04.499 --> 27:06.179
Compounded interest.

27:06.180 --> 27:09.459
Compounded interest on stolen gold?

27:09.460 --> 27:13.099
Mick, have you ever even
read a Wall Street Journal?

27:13.100 --> 27:15.639
Look it up. Look it up on the internets.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.209
How much would $20 million compounded

27:17.210 --> 27:18.629
be worth in 40 years?

27:18.630 --> 27:20.430
For like a home loan?

27:20.431 --> 27:21.549
Whatever.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.599
Jeez. Fuckin' idiots.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.478
Okay, four percent over 40 years...

27:27.720 --> 27:31.269
$20 million... would
be $100 million, Pop.

27:31.270 --> 27:32.692
You owe me $100 million.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.028
Fuck you!

27:34.987 --> 27:36.822
Ohh!

27:38.520 --> 27:40.239
I could kill you and walk away.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.210
I'm a ghost.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.159
He survived the explosion.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.501
Yeah.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.239
And then what, just...

27:53.240 --> 27:55.700
put his thumb up and hitchhiked away?

27:56.820 --> 27:58.679
Way he tells it, he ran into the woods,

27:58.680 --> 28:01.889
stole some clothes and a car,
and drove back to the city.

28:02.860 --> 28:04.560
Can I get you anything else?

28:04.570 --> 28:06.060
The check.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.319
So what does he want with my dad?

28:10.320 --> 28:11.482
Money.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.400
With Mick, it's usually about money.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.199
How much?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.910
How much has he got?

28:20.560 --> 28:23.939
Well, if he wants more than $50,000,

28:23.940 --> 28:26.079
he's gonna have to go through Gerald.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.331
Who's that?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.459
He's my dad's transfer agent.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.259
Yeah, this is Sandy Patrick.

28:55.260 --> 28:58.730
Card number 5477, 2781,

28:58.737 --> 29:02.359
5200, 6529.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.479
Yeah.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.529
Can you text me purchase alerts, please?

29:07.530 --> 29:10.919
No, the number you have on file is fine.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.239
We good?

29:14.240 --> 29:15.460
Do me a favor.

29:15.470 --> 29:17.039
Buy a round for everyone in the place

29:17.040 --> 29:18.620
and add a hundred bucks for yourself.

29:19.710 --> 29:21.510
Thanks, pal.

29:35.850 --> 29:38.193
_

29:39.560 --> 29:41.649
You fucking kidding me?

29:41.650 --> 29:43.899
Just tell me a fuckin' number

29:43.900 --> 29:45.819
so I can figure out

29:45.820 --> 29:48.871
whether I'd rather die or pay it.

29:49.950 --> 29:51.290
My number...

29:54.920 --> 29:58.399
My number's half of
everything you fuckin' got.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.790
That's my number.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.719
We were playin' poker
this time at O'Neil's.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.879
You'll remember this.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.009
Mick had a good run,
then the heat left him.

30:09.010 --> 30:13.219
He got himself dealt out
and he walked away.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.099
That was before he
lost it all, you know?

30:16.100 --> 30:20.902
He had promised his wife
money to pay the bills.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.269
I don't remember that.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.322
You don't remember
payin' the bills, Mick,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.609
'cause, um, before you left,

30:26.610 --> 30:29.953
you hired two black hookers
who fed you some sob story

30:29.954 --> 30:33.590
and you gave them the money
you'd promised your wife.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.819
Well, that was stupid.

30:36.820 --> 30:40.460
And maybe I... I always
was a little too soft at it.

30:40.470 --> 30:41.620
There it is... you're the guy

30:41.630 --> 30:43.629
who would fuck over the
people he loves the most

30:43.630 --> 30:45.840
and call it soft-hearted.

30:45.850 --> 30:48.299
At least someone cruel lets
you know where you stand.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.219
But a piece of shit...

30:51.220 --> 30:55.639
who's righteous, thinks he's good?

30:55.640 --> 30:58.179
Fuck me.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.519
Daryll...

31:03.520 --> 31:06.030
maybe you should wait out in the car.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.495
Five percent.

31:13.620 --> 31:14.739
Fifty.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.369
Ten. Tops.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.049
Twenty.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.170
You even know how much that is?

31:28.178 --> 31:31.180
Twenty fuckin' percent.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.219
Hello?

31:43.220 --> 31:45.560
Yes, Mr. Sullivan.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.859
- Yes...
- I'm dead.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.661
So I gotta put it in
my son Terry's name.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.159
Terence Donovan.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.289
You say Terry?

31:57.290 --> 31:59.159
He's the eldest.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.709
- Terry, Pop?
- Trust me, Daryll.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.619
I'm gonna take care of all my boys.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.089
You'll each get your share.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.879
Are you done?

32:07.880 --> 32:11.138
Yeah. Terence Donovan.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.140
Terence Donovan.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.070
Terence.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.239
Hi.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.699
I need you to go stake
out Sandy's house.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.739
Aunt Sandy?

32:36.740 --> 32:38.079
Now?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.539
Yeah, now.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.640
McSorley's.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.869
What for?

32:42.870 --> 32:45.079
Mick kidnapped Jim Sullivan.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.789
Oh, Jesus Christ.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.299
Slow down, lady.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.510
I gotta go, Bunch.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.430
Gimme the phone.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.240
Gimme the phone.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.849
What are you doing, Sandy?

33:04.850 --> 33:07.139
- Ray?
- Where's Mick?

33:07.140 --> 33:08.569
Fuck you!

33:08.570 --> 33:11.656
You know how this ends.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.282
Do I?

33:13.283 --> 33:14.909
Just tell me where he is.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.910
I'm not gonna ask you again, Sandy.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.579
You don't scare me, Ray.

33:24.620 --> 33:26.672
Fuck yourself!

33:33.900 --> 33:36.930
Where can I find your
father's transfer agent?

33:38.850 --> 33:44.399
_

34:11.560 --> 34:13.418
Should I go inside?

34:13.420 --> 34:15.219
Not yet.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.099
Hey, Ter.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.719
Hey, uh...

34:22.719 --> 34:26.199
S-Smitty got picked up
by the black lady cop.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.340
When?

34:27.350 --> 34:29.228
A f-few hours ago.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.560
- He still there?
- No, no, I...

34:31.570 --> 34:33.399
I picked him up, took him home.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.899
How's he doin'?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.319
Uh, he seems fine.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.109
All right.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.869
Oh, I-I got your car.

34:39.870 --> 34:43.369
Can you bring it to me?
I'll text you an address.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.417
All right.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.239
Hey, that's him. That's him.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.539
- What are you doing?
- I've known him my whole life.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.060
I can talk to him.

35:11.650 --> 35:12.939
Shit.

35:17.060 --> 35:19.440
Hey, Mr. Moskovitz.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.069
Miss Sullivan.

35:21.070 --> 35:22.909
Has my father called you?

35:22.910 --> 35:25.665
You know I can't disclose that.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.832
Is that his ransom in that briefcase?

35:27.833 --> 35:30.379
- I can't disclose that.
- Please listen to me.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.259
These people are murderers, okay?

35:32.260 --> 35:34.319
It doesn't matter if you
give them what they want.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.801
They'll still kill him.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.512
- Let's take you home now.
- No, please!

35:39.170 --> 35:40.589
Stop it!

35:40.590 --> 35:42.470
Hey, stop it!

35:44.220 --> 35:46.399
Get your fucking hands off me.

35:47.890 --> 35:50.064
Get in the car.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.359
- Ahh!
- Oh, God.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.669
Fuck.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.799
No, no, no, no, no!

36:22.800 --> 36:24.859
No, no!

36:24.860 --> 36:27.120
What the fuck, Ray?

36:35.580 --> 36:37.840
Where are you going?

36:50.580 --> 36:53.119
Terry'll drive you home.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.490
She's not here.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.180
What the fuck happened to you?

37:23.860 --> 37:25.569
Long story.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.619
What's that for?

37:27.620 --> 37:29.670
Call the fire department.

38:33.420 --> 38:36.809
- What?
- Is this Sandra Patrick?

38:36.810 --> 38:38.519
Who the fuck is this?

38:38.520 --> 38:40.899
Ms. Patrick, this is the
Medford Fire Department

38:40.900 --> 38:44.279
calling to report an
incident at your house.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.480
What did you say?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.479
Hey.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.969
Um... are you the, uh...

39:15.970 --> 39:17.731
I'm the transfer agent.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.790
Oh.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.210
Your boy's got the papers.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.060
Oh...

40:38.980 --> 40:43.019
Oh, no.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.860
Jesus.

40:47.420 --> 40:49.400
Where is he, Sandy?

40:51.740 --> 40:53.659
You torched my fuckin' house?

40:53.660 --> 40:55.100
Where is he?

40:55.110 --> 40:57.360
You son of a bitch!

40:59.499 --> 41:01.539
What'd he promise you?

41:01.540 --> 41:04.879
Half the take? Fuckin' condo in Boca?

41:04.880 --> 41:06.499
Fuck you, Raymond.

41:06.500 --> 41:09.219
How do you think that's
gonna work out for ya, huh?

41:09.220 --> 41:11.209
Have any of Mick's fuckin'
harebrained schemes

41:11.210 --> 41:14.014
ever paid out the way
he promised they would?

41:16.140 --> 41:18.599
He was doin' this for you.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.160
He was...

41:20.170 --> 41:23.647
leaving you and your brothers a legacy.

41:23.648 --> 41:26.399
Legacy.

41:28.730 --> 41:32.479
Mick's already left us
his fuckin' legacy.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.340
Remember?

41:35.350 --> 41:37.909
You were there.

41:37.910 --> 41:40.119
My mother's funeral. My sister Bridget.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.449
Father O'Connor, Cormac.

41:41.450 --> 41:44.085
That's Mick's fuckin' legacy.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.090
Trail of bodies and
broken fuckin' lives.

41:49.980 --> 41:52.590
You wanna be a part a that?

42:02.220 --> 42:04.320
Smitty?

42:06.020 --> 42:07.499
Y-you okay?

42:07.500 --> 42:09.809
That cop questioned me.

42:09.810 --> 42:11.195
What?

42:11.196 --> 42:13.319
She questioned me for hours.
She showed me photos.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.319
She knows a lot.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.540
Well, what did you tell her?

42:16.550 --> 42:18.279
I told her the fucking story

42:18.280 --> 42:20.369
that we were at your
boyfriend's fucking concert

42:20.370 --> 42:22.740
with his fucking boy band.

42:22.750 --> 42:25.130
Why did you do it?

42:27.840 --> 42:29.210
I don't know.

42:29.214 --> 42:32.169
That's bullshit.

42:32.170 --> 42:33.467
I don't.

42:33.468 --> 42:36.054
- That's bullshit.
- I don't, I...

42:37.460 --> 42:40.549
I'm so afraid I'm like my father.

42:40.550 --> 42:42.359
Oh, so you act like him?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.309
You don't get to use that as an excuse.

42:44.310 --> 42:45.579
No, it's not an excuse.

42:45.580 --> 42:47.979
I promise you, I had it worse than you,

42:47.980 --> 42:50.259
but I would never use
my fuckin' childhood

42:50.260 --> 42:51.902
as an excuse to hurt you.

43:52.540 --> 43:55.419
Fuck this.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.139
Daryll, answer the fuckin' phone.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.490
It's your father.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.460
Leave a message.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.370
Sandy.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.219
What the fuck did you do?

44:41.220 --> 44:43.348
What?

44:44.900 --> 44:46.970
What the fuck did you do?

44:48.470 --> 44:51.147
I-I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, Mick.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.719
You fucked me all over again?

44:57.720 --> 44:59.229
Hey, hey, I'm just sittin' here.

44:59.230 --> 45:00.615
I'm not a fuckin' magician.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.910
I'll kill him, Ray.

45:12.919 --> 45:16.249
I'll fuckin' kill him. You know I will.

45:16.250 --> 45:19.620
Get away from the door.

45:28.380 --> 45:30.220
Now, move over there.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.905
I'm gonna make it right before I go.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.866
You're gonna believe in me again, son.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.599
It's me!

46:18.560 --> 46:20.729
Oh, I'm back!

46:20.730 --> 46:23.830
Out early for good behavior.

46:29.740 --> 46:32.289
You should have killed him.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.369
He would have shot you.

46:34.370 --> 46:36.399
I'm not talkin' about tonight.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.579
I'm talkin' about when
you came in that bar

46:39.580 --> 46:40.839
carrying a kitchen knife

46:40.840 --> 46:42.925
longer than your skinny little arm.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.120
Remember?

47:08.826 --> 47:11.259
I could see it then.

47:11.260 --> 47:13.700
You actually had it in ya.

47:14.790 --> 47:18.090
And with a knife, no less.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.800
So fuckin' personal.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.460
Thanks.

47:37.860 --> 47:41.770
I wonder, Ray, if you
still got it in you now.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.199
Aren't you gonna say hello
to your father, Ray-Ray?

47:51.940 --> 47:53.919
Aren't ya?
