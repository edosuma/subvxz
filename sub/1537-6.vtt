00:03.997 --> 00:06.999
Amy Santiago is officially
late for the first time ever.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.034
All right, let's do this.
Who's got theories?

00:09.035 --> 00:11.069
Uh...
Alarm didn't go off.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.704
All three alarms?
All with battery back-up?

00:12.705 --> 00:14.971
Come on, who wants
to take this seriously?

00:14.972 --> 00:16.708
Ooh!
She was taken in her sleep!

00:16.709 --> 00:18.143
That's what I'm talking about!

00:18.144 --> 00:19.811
Super dark, Boyle,
but way more plausible

00:19.812 --> 00:22.395
than the sarge's idiotic
alarm clock theory.

00:22.396 --> 00:24.082
I bet she tucked herself
into bed too tight

00:24.083 --> 00:25.250
and got stuck.

00:25.251 --> 00:26.985
Mm, maybe she Fell
into another dimension

00:26.986 --> 00:28.693
where she's interesting.

00:28.694 --> 00:31.390
It's 9:00 A.M.
why is no one working?

00:31.391 --> 00:33.025
Amy Santiago is
a few minutes late,

00:33.026 --> 00:34.660
and we're all trying
to guess why.

00:34.661 --> 00:36.728
I'd like to play.

00:36.729 --> 00:41.400
I'd say she's in line
at the bank.

00:41.401 --> 00:43.101
This is fun.
<i>(Jake) It is fun,</i>

00:43.102 --> 00:45.127
<i>but you're
all wrong.</i>

00:45.128 --> 00:47.272
She clearly slipped through
a subway grate

00:47.273 --> 00:50.006
and is having terrible sex
with a mole man.

00:52.946 --> 00:54.379
Where have you been?

00:54.380 --> 00:56.648
We've been worried sick.
Do you care to explain yourself?

00:56.649 --> 00:58.383
I'm just 70 seconds late.
It's not a big deal.

00:58.384 --> 01:00.182
Don't worry about it.

01:00.188 --> 01:03.722
Santiago, you will tell us,
and you will tell us now.

01:03.723 --> 01:05.397
There was a problem
at the bank.

about going

02:12.992 --> 02:14.426
On my first date
with my wife,

02:14.427 --> 02:17.629
all we did was talk about
our mutual love of meat loaf.

02:17.630 --> 02:18.964
The singer
not the food.

02:18.965 --> 02:22.367
Oh, so the weirder
of the two choices.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.002
All right, fine.
I get what you're saying.

02:24.003 --> 02:25.537
Your wife's awesome

Hi!

02:49.229 --> 02:50.662
(Rosa)
Captain...

02:50.663 --> 02:52.231
We need to talk
about the union rep elections.

02:52.232 --> 02:54.566
Scully is running again,
unopposed.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.668
He is incompetent.

02:56.669 --> 02:57.936
If there's one thing
to take away

02:57.937 --> 03:00.038
from the new contract,
it's that holiday pay

03:00.039 --> 03:01.551
is "now capped."

03:01.552 --> 03:02.975
Or "not capped."

03:02.976 --> 03:06.643
In conclusion,
the word "capped" was said.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.480
Whoo!
Nailed it.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.314
The only reason Scully
does the job

03:12.320 --> 03:14.820
is because the annual
union meeting has a party sub.

03:14.821 --> 03:16.822
He's been a rep for 12 years,
and he still pronounces

03:16.823 --> 03:18.905
"union" as "onion."

03:18.906 --> 03:22.534
As management, I'm not allowed
to talk about union matters.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.663
Scully doesn't know
anything about our pensions

03:24.664 --> 03:25.864
and he has no idea
about the new

03:25.865 --> 03:27.866
disciplinary guidelines.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.332
What do you think, captain?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.802
What I think is,
I will continue

03:30.803 --> 03:33.586
to not talk
about this issue.

03:33.587 --> 03:34.940
Hey, you should run.

03:34.941 --> 03:36.608
Going to meetings,
writing stuff down.

03:36.609 --> 03:38.049
You love that nerd stuff.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.645
"Writing things down"
is nerdy?

03:39.646 --> 03:40.646
What do you do?

03:40.647 --> 03:42.181
I just forget stuff
like a cool person.

03:42.182 --> 03:44.716

you care about this crap.

03:44.717 --> 03:45.784
Maybe.

03:45.785 --> 03:47.052
But I want to be
captain one day,

03:47.053 --> 03:48.921
and union reps are always
fighting with the brass.

03:48.922 --> 03:50.979
It's career suicide,
right, sir?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.559
Stop trying
to get me involved, Santiago.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.295
No! I'm already fighting
with the brass.

03:56.296 --> 03:57.484
Look at what you've done!

03:59.200 --> 04:01.667
Oh man, these look spicy!

04:01.668 --> 04:02.668
We may die tonight.

04:02.669 --> 04:03.902
You know, I actually
heard about a guy

04:03.903 --> 04:05.971
who died while eating hot wings.
Really?

04:05.972 --> 04:07.506
Yeah, he was terminally ill
beforehand though.

04:07.507 --> 04:08.621
Unrelated.

04:08.622 --> 04:10.876
I always thought I'd die
at the hands of my own clone.

04:10.877 --> 04:12.244
Well, that's why you have
to brand the number two

04:12.245 --> 04:13.846
into your clone's cheek.

04:13.847 --> 04:15.446
You shouldn't have a clone
if you don't know that.

04:15.447 --> 04:16.281
Yes.

04:16.281 --> 04:17.281
All right,
you ready?

04:17.283 --> 04:18.255
I'm ready.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.051
Here we go.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.288
That's nothing.
Amateur night.

04:23.289 --> 04:25.124
I can't believe this had three
peppers next to it on the menu...

04:25.125 --> 04:26.725
Oh, my God!
Ah!

04:26.726 --> 04:28.594
- Hot!
- Oh, so spicy!

04:28.595 --> 04:30.028
Drink the ranch!
Drink the ranch!

04:30.029 --> 04:32.811
Ah! Ah!

04:34.067 --> 04:35.434
Here's the stuff you left
at my place.

04:35.435 --> 04:38.276
Your <i> sounds of Ibiza</i>
sleep cd,

04:38.277 --> 04:40.405
seven phone chargers,
and an empty jar

04:40.406 --> 04:41.940
labeled "fire spirit."

04:41.941 --> 04:44.074
No, it's not empty.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.044
Well, here's your stuff.

04:46.045 --> 04:48.787
So I guess
it's officially over.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.049
It was slightly less gross
than I expected.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.050
Mm.

04:52.051 --> 04:54.553
Way to be.

04:54.554 --> 04:56.155
Uh, there is one
last thing.

04:56.156 --> 04:58.957
The luxury sex romp
we had planned this weekend.

04:58.958 --> 05:01.360
The hotel says the
"bubbles and bathrobes" package

05:01.361 --> 05:02.675
is non-refundable.

05:02.676 --> 05:04.897
See, that's why I didn't want
to pre-pay, Charles.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.765
Yeah, but that's why
we got such a good deal.

05:06.766 --> 05:09.015
One hour of free Wi-Fi!

05:09.016 --> 05:10.702
Don't worry,
you can have your half

05:10.703 --> 05:12.337
of the money back,
and I'll take the room.

05:12.338 --> 05:13.645
Pause.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.741
Okay, if one of us
is getting pampered all night,

05:15.742 --> 05:17.190
it's gonna be me.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.911
I want that room, Gina.

05:18.912 --> 05:20.479
You can't push me around.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.181
We're not poke pals
anymore!

05:22.182 --> 05:24.738
Ew!

05:26.085 --> 05:27.152
Amy Santiago,

05:27.153 --> 05:28.487
surprised
to see you walking around.

05:28.488 --> 05:30.489
Shouldn't you be
on your belly, you snake?

05:30.490 --> 05:33.826
Yeah, you snake!
[Hisses]

05:33.827 --> 05:35.394
What is happening?

05:35.395 --> 05:36.695
You're running against me.

05:36.696 --> 05:38.664
What?
Rosa must've done this.

05:38.665 --> 05:40.004
I'll get her to stop.

05:40.005 --> 05:42.167
You know what really
burns my pants?

05:42.168 --> 05:44.303
I considered you
my best friend.

05:44.304 --> 05:46.926
What?
What?

05:48.392 --> 05:50.609
Hi.
Hey now.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.144
You are looking
very happy.

05:52.145 --> 05:53.145
I am.

05:53.146 --> 05:54.213
Guess what happened
last night.

05:54.214 --> 05:55.748
Spoiler alert:
Sexy-times.

05:55.749 --> 05:56.815
Okay, now guess.

05:56.816 --> 05:57.816
Sexy-times!

05:57.817 --> 05:59.451
Yes! The whole night
was amazing.

05:59.452 --> 06:00.817
We totally hit it off.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.221
I found our meat loaf.
Wings.

06:02.222 --> 06:03.222
The band or the show?

06:03.223 --> 06:04.223
The food!

06:04.224 --> 06:05.624
We went back
to her place,

06:05.625 --> 06:07.459
watched <i> die hards</i> one
through <i> with a vengeance,</i>

06:07.460 --> 06:09.495
did some adult stuff,
and spent the rest of the night

06:09.496 --> 06:10.963
debating who's the better
ping-pong player.

06:10.964 --> 06:12.798
She was adorably wrong.

06:12.799 --> 06:14.266
How do you know
if you didn't play?

06:14.267 --> 06:15.734
Oh, we played,
which was difficult

06:15.735 --> 06:17.336
since she didn't have
a table or paddles.

06:17.337 --> 06:18.737
We had to use
an avocado pit as the ball.

06:18.738 --> 06:20.105
It was very messy.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.106
<i>(Carl)
Hey guys.</i>

06:21.107 --> 06:23.242
Ah, hello,
district attorney kurm.

06:23.243 --> 06:24.343
I got lucky last night.

06:24.344 --> 06:25.344
That's great.

06:25.345 --> 06:26.345
Yeah.

06:26.346 --> 06:27.546
So we have
a little delay.

06:27.547 --> 06:28.881
Gary, the defense attorney,
isn't gonna be here.

06:28.882 --> 06:30.649
Oh, is he sore
from high-fiving criminals

06:30.650 --> 06:31.850
he's gotten out of jail?

06:31.851 --> 06:32.918
<i>Did he get
a murderer off</i>

06:32.919 --> 06:34.453
who then murdered him
to celebrate?

06:34.454 --> 06:35.721
Yup.

06:35.722 --> 06:37.956
Anyway, Gary broke his leg,
so he's being replaced.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.958
Replaced?
He should be put down.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.593
Like a horse.

06:41.594 --> 06:44.530
So who's the new sub-human
piece of human garbage?

06:44.531 --> 06:46.732
Sophia Perez.

06:49.495 --> 06:52.204
Oh, God.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.507
Jake, this is bad!

06:57.508 --> 06:59.743
You slept with
a defense attorney.

06:59.744 --> 07:01.878
You literally slept
with the enemy.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.213
I know.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.782
Ah, it's like if John McClane
slept with Hans Gruber.

07:05.783 --> 07:08.451
Or even worse, Jeremy irons
from the third one.

07:08.452 --> 07:09.452
We didn't talk
about our jobs.

07:09.453 --> 07:10.635
How was I supposed
to know?

07:12.089 --> 07:14.324
Wait, are you sure
you want to do this?

07:14.325 --> 07:16.259
Let's go over
the events of tonight.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.660
We got drunk together,
I invited you

07:17.661 --> 07:19.763
up to my apartment,
and I kissed you first.

07:19.764 --> 07:21.064
No further questions.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.899
Okay.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.268
Uh-oh.
She's waving at you.

07:25.269 --> 07:28.171
Hey. All right,
I'm gonna go talk to her.

07:28.172 --> 07:29.439
Be strong.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.608
Okay.

07:31.609 --> 07:32.676
Hey.

07:32.677 --> 07:34.077
Hey, so this is weird,
huh?

07:34.078 --> 07:36.146
Yeah. You never told me
you were a cop.

07:36.147 --> 07:37.847
Yeah, and you never told me
you were a lawyer.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.849
Well, I didn't wanna
intimidate you.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.284
Intimidate? Wow.

07:41.285 --> 07:42.485
Okay, well, not to burst
your bubble,

07:42.486 --> 07:44.287
but I'm only intimidated
by professions

07:44.288 --> 07:46.523
that have a moral compass,
like police officer.

07:46.524 --> 07:48.758
So you're intimidated
by your own job?

07:48.759 --> 07:50.960
"Oh, look at me.
I'm a lawyer.

07:50.961 --> 07:53.463
I'm so good
at word-using-itude."

07:53.464 --> 07:55.699
And yes, I know that
that wasn't a word, right.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.000
Okay, you know what?

07:57.001 --> 07:58.668
I can't even believe I have
to deal with you all week.

07:58.669 --> 07:59.803
Not a problem.

07:59.804 --> 08:01.338
This is clearly a conflict
of interest.

08:01.339 --> 08:02.672
So I'm just gonna talk
to the judge

08:02.673 --> 08:04.040
and have you kicked off
the case.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.942
Ha ha! No, there's no
conflict of interest.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.177
Because I'm not
interested in you.

08:07.178 --> 08:08.278
Ah.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.813
God, I can't believe
I slept with a cop.

08:09.814 --> 08:11.548
It's like a had sex
with Hans Gruber.

08:11.549 --> 08:12.916
What...
I'm not the Gruber!

08:12.917 --> 08:14.784
You're the Gruber!

08:14.785 --> 08:16.586
<i>Die Hard.</i>

08:16.587 --> 08:19.789
Captain, Rosa's trying
to make me run for union rep.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.091
You have to stop her.

08:21.092 --> 08:22.359
I cannot do that.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.094
As I told you, I'm not allowed
to get involved.

08:24.095 --> 08:25.095
It's too late anyway.

08:25.096 --> 08:26.162
You already have
a campaign slogan.

08:26.163 --> 08:27.964
"Pick Amy, dummies."
I wrote that.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.099
Tell her how good it is,
captain.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.433
Again, I cannot.

08:30.434 --> 08:32.769
Look, I love campaigning
and making signs.

08:32.770 --> 08:35.221
Lord knows I have enough
poster board at home.

08:35.222 --> 08:38.308
But captain, please tell her
I shouldn't run for union rep.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.943
I'm just gonna turn around
in my chair.

08:39.943 --> 08:43.746
So, Amy, you're saying
I should just return this...

08:43.748 --> 08:46.316
Button maker?

08:46.317 --> 08:49.619
You think you can tempt me
with a t150 button maker?

08:49.620 --> 08:51.254
Sir, you've gotta
see this.

08:51.255 --> 08:53.790
It doesn't even make
mirror-backs.

08:53.791 --> 08:54.791
This is a joke.

08:54.792 --> 08:55.792
<i>Still not participating.</i>

08:55.793 --> 08:57.627
I'm enjoying a magazine.

08:57.628 --> 08:59.095
Joke's on you, Amy.
You and Scully

08:59.096 --> 09:00.230
are giving campaign speeches

09:00.231 --> 09:01.914
in the briefing room
tomorrow.

09:01.915 --> 09:02.766
What?

09:02.767 --> 09:05.001
Sir, permission
to arrest Diaz

09:05.002 --> 09:06.136
for being a jerk.

09:06.137 --> 09:08.204
Permission to shoot Santiago
for being a coward.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.473
Stop it, both of you.

09:10.474 --> 09:11.675
Now you've done it.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.810
You've made me turn my chair.

09:13.811 --> 09:16.880
I will not get involved,
and I will not have this office

09:16.881 --> 09:21.768
transformed into a house
of snipes and jabs.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.887
Dismissed.

09:23.888 --> 09:25.455
Full disclosure, your honor.

09:25.456 --> 09:27.324
Last night, miss Perez and I
got inebriated,

09:27.325 --> 09:29.826
and we had colitis.

09:29.827 --> 09:30.827
<i>Colitis?</i>

09:30.828 --> 09:32.111
Coitus.

09:32.112 --> 09:33.112
Yeah, that.

09:33.113 --> 09:35.065
A cop and a defense attorney
sleeping together.

09:35.066 --> 09:36.466
That's highly unusual.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.568
At the time, I did not know
she was a defense attorney.

09:38.569 --> 09:39.970
I should have been able
to guess, however,

09:40.457 --> 09:43.506
based on her ability
to <i> lie</i> all over me.

09:43.507 --> 09:45.108
Ha ha... a cop's attempt
to be clever.

09:45.109 --> 09:47.444
It's like watching a horse
try to eat with a fork.

09:47.445 --> 09:48.745
Majestic and hilarious?

09:48.746 --> 09:50.835
Take a cold shower, horn-dog,
we're at work.

09:50.836 --> 09:52.716
But in all seriousness,
your honor,

09:52.717 --> 09:54.618
I do think she should
recuse herself from the trial.

09:54.619 --> 09:56.753
Why? You think I might tell
everybody in the courtroom

09:56.754 --> 09:58.288
that you like
to be the little spoon?

09:58.289 --> 09:59.656
Everyone likes
to be the little spoon.

09:59.657 --> 10:01.358
It makes you feel safe!

10:01.359 --> 10:02.733
Carl, back me up
on this.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.661
- Yes, little spoon all the way.
- See?

10:04.662 --> 10:06.129
Look, I'm not
recusing myself.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.397
I talked to my client,
and he is fine

10:07.398 --> 10:08.498
with me staying on.

10:08.499 --> 10:10.100
If the defendant
is okay with it,

10:10.101 --> 10:12.110
and you two can be mature
in the courtroom,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.404
then I see no reason
why we can't proceed.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.739
Great.
I can be mature.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.241
Says the guy who uses
a sunglasses case as a wallet.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.743
Stuff can be two things.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.344
Open up your refrigerator,
boom!

10:21.345 --> 10:22.746
Air conditioner.
Life hacked.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.947
Carl, back me up.

10:23.948 --> 10:25.282
I mean, it's not
very green.

10:25.283 --> 10:27.542
Oh, Carl.

10:27.543 --> 10:28.585
Guys!

10:28.586 --> 10:29.653
Guys, guys,
guys, guys!

10:29.654 --> 10:31.888
My pizza reviews
caught the eye

10:31.889 --> 10:35.392
of a Mr. Matt Pittle
of Pittle's vittles,

10:35.393 --> 10:36.927
my favorite food blog!

10:36.928 --> 10:38.662
<i>Wow, a local food blog.</i>

10:38.663 --> 10:40.063
It's all happening.

10:40.064 --> 10:42.332
Pittle wants to have a five- hour
dinner with me tonight.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.936
Attention, skeezy nobodies!

10:45.937 --> 10:47.737
Tina Knowles,
Beyonce's mom-ager,

10:47.738 --> 10:50.974
has contacted me and wants
to audition me tonight.

10:50.975 --> 10:53.067
I've transcended
you now.

10:53.068 --> 10:56.738
Sounds like both of you
have pretty great plans tonight.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.682
No! You wrote the email
from Pittle

10:58.683 --> 11:00.483
so I'd drop my claim
to the room.

11:00.484 --> 11:01.993
That blog is sacred.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.454
You defiled
the most sacred

11:04.455 --> 11:09.292
and most high
miss... Tina kno-w-les!

11:09.293 --> 11:10.660
How dare you, Charles?

11:10.661 --> 11:12.495
How'd you get your voice
so high?

11:12.496 --> 11:14.097
[Shrilly]
I can take it higher.

11:14.098 --> 11:15.866
I wish you wouldn't.

11:15.867 --> 11:18.869
The room is mine,
you scab.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.887
No, it's mine, Gina.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.073
I'm not backing down
this time.

11:23.074 --> 11:24.875
I'm backing up.

11:24.876 --> 11:27.077
Beep, beep, beep.

11:27.078 --> 11:28.278
[Coughs]

11:30.381 --> 11:31.381
You nervous?

11:31.382 --> 11:32.616
Nope.

11:32.617 --> 11:34.885
I have an unimpeachable
eyewitness who saw everything.

11:34.886 --> 11:36.052
Plus, I've got
a little something planned

11:36.053 --> 11:37.053
for our lawyer friend.

11:37.054 --> 11:38.488
Every time she
looks over,

11:38.489 --> 11:40.457
I'm gonna hit her
with one of these.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.292
It'll remind her
that we kissed,

11:42.293 --> 11:44.076
and that's how
I get in her head.

11:44.077 --> 11:45.428
I like it.

11:45.429 --> 11:46.897
You want me to flex
and make all the buttons

11:46.898 --> 11:47.898
pop off of my shirt?

11:47.899 --> 11:50.233
Yes!
You can do that?

11:50.234 --> 11:52.869
The challenge is keeping
the buttons on.

11:52.870 --> 11:55.305
Oh, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

11:55.306 --> 11:57.174
And you're sure
this is the man

11:57.175 --> 11:59.910
you saw leaving the store at
the time of the diamond heist?

11:59.911 --> 12:01.878
Nice. "Diamond heist,"
catching on.

12:01.879 --> 12:03.013
Uh, yeah.
That's the guy.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.414
Now, Mr. Wells,
it says here

12:04.415 --> 12:08.485
you have a 2006 conviction
for perjury, is that correct?

12:08.486 --> 12:10.153
Uh... yeah.

12:10.154 --> 12:11.588
It's okay.
I knew about that.

12:11.589 --> 12:13.323
And is Sidney Wells
actually your name,

12:13.324 --> 12:15.125
or is it Brian Davidson?

12:15.126 --> 12:16.526
Uh-oh.
Did not know about that one.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.962
As in the Brian Davidson
who is facing fraud charges

12:18.963 --> 12:20.564
in New Jersey?
Yeah.

12:20.565 --> 12:24.323
Or that. Oh, God... okay,
time to bust out the big guns.

12:25.336 --> 12:26.736
<i>(Jake)
This is bad.</i>

12:26.737 --> 12:28.271
Only the judge saw me.

12:28.272 --> 12:30.498
(Sophia) No further questions,
your honor.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.509
Ugh, winking?
Real mature.

12:33.811 --> 12:35.111
(Carl)
Judge gave us a recess,

12:35.112 --> 12:36.179
but if we don't get
new evidence by tomorrow,

12:36.180 --> 12:37.547
we have no chance.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.840
Great pep talk, Carl.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.132
Don't worry,
we'll get some evidence.

12:41.138 --> 12:43.386
Excuse me one second.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.922
Hey, that wasn't cool.

12:45.923 --> 12:47.924
No. What wasn't cool was you
trying to air make-out

12:47.925 --> 12:48.925
with the judge.

12:48.926 --> 12:50.627
Those kisses
were meant for you!

12:50.628 --> 12:52.829
Not in a romantic way,
they were psych-out kisses.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.297
Look, you know
your client did it.

12:54.298 --> 12:56.066
It doesn't matter
if my client did it or not.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.602
That's what I've been saying.
[Whispers] It doesn't matter.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.137
All right,
Scott, beat it.

13:00.138 --> 13:01.638
Scott.

13:01.639 --> 13:04.207
Look, my job is to make you
prove he did it.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.076
It's the basis
of our entire justice system.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.878
What, you think John Adams
was just some idiot?

13:07.879 --> 13:09.846
No, I think <i> John Adams</i>
was a mini-series

13:09.847 --> 13:12.121
I didn't watch because
it looked like a book.

13:12.127 --> 13:14.684
Look, without a credible
witness, your case is a mess.

13:14.685 --> 13:16.669
Kinda like your ping-pong
serve.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.855
Oh, my God.
She smells so good.

13:18.856 --> 13:22.225
That avocado pit
was not regulation.

13:22.226 --> 13:23.759
Wish that had sounded cooler.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.128
Come on, Terry,
let's go save the day.

13:25.129 --> 13:26.129
Carl, you wanna come?

13:26.130 --> 13:27.764
No, thank you.
All right.

13:29.681 --> 13:31.518
All right, listen up.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.625
We need more evidences
on this guy and we need it quick,

13:33.626 --> 13:35.093
so no time for chit-chat.

13:35.094 --> 13:37.295
What's going on?
You love chit-chat.

13:37.296 --> 13:39.397
Yeah, also, your posture
seems off,

13:39.398 --> 13:40.932
like, it's good.

13:40.933 --> 13:42.367
Because I'm being serious

13:42.368 --> 13:44.503
because I don't want
this perp to walk.

13:44.504 --> 13:46.705
This isn't about the perp.

13:46.706 --> 13:48.340
It's about this woman.

13:48.341 --> 13:50.242
Jake slept with her.

13:50.243 --> 13:51.476
Oh, she's so pretty.

13:51.477 --> 13:53.845
She looks like the woman
on an olive oil bottle.

13:53.846 --> 13:54.846
Way to go, Jake.

13:54.847 --> 13:55.847
She's a defense attorney.

13:55.848 --> 13:58.150
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Boo!

13:58.151 --> 14:00.452
Hey, guys,
let's take it easy on him.

14:00.453 --> 14:01.853
Thank you, Terry.

14:01.854 --> 14:04.222
But seriously, I think you need
to get checked for rabies.

14:04.223 --> 14:05.957
Hey, I have a good rabies guy,
if you need one.

14:05.958 --> 14:07.425
Uh-huh. All right, listen.

14:07.426 --> 14:08.554
Can we focus up?

14:08.555 --> 14:11.129
Our witness is useless,
so we either need to recover

14:11.130 --> 14:13.765
the stolen gems or find
the break-in tool.

14:13.766 --> 14:15.100
What year was
the perp's house built in?

14:15.101 --> 14:17.302
Some of those old brownstones
had dumbwaiters.

14:17.303 --> 14:18.904
A perfect hiding spot.

14:18.905 --> 14:20.005
Good thinking, Amy.

14:20.006 --> 14:21.673
All right,
I'm gonna win this case

14:21.674 --> 14:23.642
and then we can put
my horrible sexual experience

14:23.643 --> 14:25.610
behind us forever.
<i>(Charles) I don't know Jake.</i>

14:25.611 --> 14:27.012
I'm afraid I'm gonna think
about it every time

14:27.013 --> 14:28.246
I look at your crotch.

14:28.247 --> 14:31.082
Then stop looking
at my crotch!

14:33.186 --> 14:34.553
What are you doing?

14:34.554 --> 14:36.221
Just pointing people
to the one Detective

14:36.222 --> 14:38.223
who actually wants to run
for union rep.

14:38.224 --> 14:40.292
Welcome to my nightmares,
Amy-Scully minotaur.

14:40.293 --> 14:42.661
Pretty clever signing me up
for the speech this afternoon.

14:42.662 --> 14:43.695
But guess what?

14:43.696 --> 14:46.801
Mine is epically bad
and way too long.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.100
There's a section where
I just pick people out

14:49.101 --> 14:50.368
of the crowd
and insult them.

14:50.369 --> 14:52.571
It gets really personal.

14:52.572 --> 14:55.273
Did you know that Hitchcock
is technically "a bastard"?

14:55.274 --> 14:57.520
Santiago, can I talk
to you in my office?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.769
Mm-hmm.

15:01.904 --> 15:03.148
Blinds closed?

15:03.149 --> 15:06.551
Are we having a pow-wow?

15:06.552 --> 15:08.753
As you know, I shouldn't
be talking about this election

15:08.754 --> 15:13.525
with any of my detectives,
but I will with you.

15:13.526 --> 15:14.659
Of course.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.794
Because you trust me.

15:15.795 --> 15:18.374
Because you're royally
screwing up.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.931
Oh, no, this isn't
a pow-wow.

15:19.932 --> 15:20.932
It's a haranguing.

15:20.933 --> 15:21.967
You bet it is.

15:21.968 --> 15:23.769
Stop trying to tank
this election.

15:23.770 --> 15:26.371
You know damned well
you'd make a great union rep.

15:26.372 --> 15:28.473
But, sir, I want to be
captain one day,

15:28.474 --> 15:30.909
and clashing with the brass
is career suicide.

15:30.910 --> 15:32.677
Not for me.

15:32.678 --> 15:34.813
By my very nature,
I was constantly

15:34.814 --> 15:36.715
in conflict
with my superiors.

15:36.716 --> 15:38.853
Listen, you're black
and gay,

15:38.854 --> 15:41.553
so I think you should just take
all the black, gay cases.

15:41.554 --> 15:43.437
You know, the weird stuff.

15:43.438 --> 15:46.402
I strongly disagree.

15:46.403 --> 15:51.630
But I still managed
to rise through the ranks.

15:51.631 --> 15:54.566
Run for union rep, Amy.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.437
Okay. I'll do it.

15:58.438 --> 16:02.174
But never tell anyone
about this...

16:02.175 --> 16:03.043
Pow-wow.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.843
You called it a pow-wow!

16:04.844 --> 16:07.112
<i>So, Detective Peralta,</i>

16:07.636 --> 16:09.759
you found some "new"
evidence last night.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.008
Correction: I found some damning
new evidence last night.

16:13.009 --> 16:14.519
It was hidden in an old
dumbwaiter

16:14.520 --> 16:15.821
in the defendant's house.

16:15.822 --> 16:18.309
<i>All his burglary tools,
including a glass cutter</i>

16:18.310 --> 16:19.991
he used to break
into the store.

16:19.992 --> 16:22.327
<i>(Sophia) Yes, but isn't it possible
my client could've used</i>

16:22.328 --> 16:25.430
the glass cutter for something
other than a robbery?

16:25.431 --> 16:29.367
I mean, after all,
stuff can do two things, right?

16:29.368 --> 16:30.736
Hey! I say that!

16:30.737 --> 16:31.737
That's my saying!

16:31.738 --> 16:33.105
Your honor,
she stole my saying.

16:33.106 --> 16:34.606
People don't own sayings.

16:34.607 --> 16:36.641
Please answer the question,
Detective.

16:36.642 --> 16:39.077
Fine. In the same bag
as the burglary tools,

16:39.078 --> 16:40.579
we also found shards
of glass.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.114
And you expect us
to believe

16:42.115 --> 16:43.749
that you found
this new evidence yesterday

16:43.750 --> 16:46.295
just as your case was
collapsing around you?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.714
<i>(Jake) I certainly hope so,
because it's the truth.</i>

16:48.715 --> 16:50.922
In fact, I believe it was
the great John Adams

16:50.923 --> 16:54.960
who once said, "to believe
all men honest is folly.

16:54.961 --> 16:58.230
To believe none...
Is something worse."

16:58.231 --> 16:59.765
Let the record show
miss Perez looks stunned

16:59.766 --> 17:02.067
and defeated.
No further questions.

17:02.068 --> 17:04.301
You're not allowed to say that.
Yup.

17:04.303 --> 17:06.729
Hey, captain, I have a juicy
little Boyle nugget

17:06.730 --> 17:08.073
I'd like to drop on you.

17:08.074 --> 17:10.442
Okay,
please drop a nugget.

17:10.443 --> 17:13.979
I think that the squad could
really increase its efficiency

17:13.980 --> 17:17.715
if Gina spent the night
re-logging all our files

17:17.717 --> 17:18.786
with keywords.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.219
The lady doth have the skills.

17:21.220 --> 17:24.415
Funny, she was just telling me
how you should work all night.

17:24.416 --> 17:25.501
Say what?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.625
Gina.

17:26.626 --> 17:28.026
Yes?

17:28.027 --> 17:29.461
<i>You've both made
compelling points</i>

17:29.462 --> 17:30.862
about the amount of work
that needs to be done

17:30.863 --> 17:33.532
around here, so you'll both
be pulling overnight shifts.

17:33.533 --> 17:39.014
Before you complain, I am
once again turning in my chair.

17:39.015 --> 17:43.775
Oh, sweet chair turn.
That's a real power move.

17:43.776 --> 17:45.010
So good.

17:45.011 --> 17:47.346
We, the jury,
find the defendant...

17:47.347 --> 17:50.482
Not guilty.
Oh, come on!

17:50.483 --> 17:51.610
Ow!

17:51.611 --> 17:53.652
Oh, I'm in too much pain
to care how cool and strong

17:53.653 --> 17:54.720
that made me look.

17:54.721 --> 17:55.954
It was already
splintering.

17:55.955 --> 17:57.522
Don't take this away
from me.

18:00.727 --> 18:03.595
Wow, well done.
Another criminal walks free.

18:03.596 --> 18:05.030
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

18:05.031 --> 18:06.598
Maybe stop calling
my client a criminal,

18:06.599 --> 18:08.534
since he was found
not guilty.

18:08.535 --> 18:12.471
Well, I find myself not guilty
of never seeing you again.

18:12.472 --> 18:14.256
So you will
see me again?

18:14.774 --> 18:16.175
No!

18:16.176 --> 18:17.176
Why, what did I say?
You know what?

18:17.177 --> 18:19.978
You're the worst!

18:19.979 --> 18:21.413
(Terry) Jake, what are you doing,
man?

18:21.414 --> 18:22.848
Walking angrily away
towards a door

18:22.849 --> 18:24.983
that I now see says
"emergency exit only" on it,

18:24.984 --> 18:27.186
so I'm turning around,
but I'm still ticked!

18:27.187 --> 18:29.144
Look, man.
Don't screw this up.

18:29.145 --> 18:32.458
I hate defense attorneys
as much as any rational adult,

18:32.459 --> 18:34.793
but you obviously have
feelings for Sophia.

18:34.794 --> 18:36.061
Yeah, anger.

18:36.062 --> 18:37.496
I don't know.

18:37.497 --> 18:39.398
It just seems to me
like you met your match.

18:39.399 --> 18:41.800
You said yourself how boring
your dates have been.

18:41.801 --> 18:44.503
But you have to admit,
Sophia wouldn't be boring.

18:44.504 --> 18:46.040
I will admit she's not boring.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.541
And we do have fun together.

18:47.542 --> 18:51.310
I guess you could say
she's passably attractive.

18:51.311 --> 18:52.945
All right, fine.
She's super hot.

18:52.946 --> 18:55.781
God, I can't believe I'm about
to ask out a defense attorney.

18:55.782 --> 18:58.083
And we all know
that Amy Santiago

18:58.084 --> 18:59.685
wants to be
captain one day,

18:59.686 --> 19:02.321
which means she will never
stand up to management.

19:02.322 --> 19:05.290
I don't want to be captain.
I just want my sub.

19:05.291 --> 19:08.761
Please just give me
back my sub.

19:08.762 --> 19:10.147
Vote Scully.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.313
[Applause]

19:13.166 --> 19:14.600
<i>(Amy)
I'm gonna make this quick.</i>

19:15.073 --> 19:17.403
Scully said that I want
to be captain, and I do.

19:17.404 --> 19:19.705
But that won't stop me
from standing up for you.

19:19.706 --> 19:23.742
He also said if you voted for
him, you'd get a golden boat.

19:23.743 --> 19:25.144
That's not real.

19:25.145 --> 19:26.872
If I get elected,
I'll go to all

19:26.873 --> 19:28.814
the union meetings,
actually pay attention,

19:28.815 --> 19:30.349
and most importantly,
I'll bring back

19:30.350 --> 19:33.629
party sub leftovers.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.554
Thank you, Scully.

19:35.555 --> 19:36.822
"Pick Amy, dummies."

19:36.823 --> 19:38.716
[Applause]

19:40.026 --> 19:41.393
<i>Hello.</i>

19:42.562 --> 19:45.330
Hey.
How'd you find me?

19:45.331 --> 19:46.809
I'm a Detective, remember?

19:46.810 --> 19:49.535
I also went into a bunch
of wrong offices first.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.170
Stole hella peppermints.

19:51.171 --> 19:52.738
So what's up?
You here to yell at me again

19:52.739 --> 19:53.739
for doing my job?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.507
No, I'm here
to ask you out.

19:55.508 --> 19:56.842
Oh.
Yeah.

19:56.843 --> 19:57.843
There's a bar
in the west village

19:57.844 --> 19:59.011
that has a bunch
of ping-pong tables,

19:59.012 --> 20:00.446
so I thought we could
head over there

20:00.447 --> 20:03.284
and have a drink, talk,
and then, with any luck,

20:03.285 --> 20:05.384
things will get uncomfortably
competitive.

20:05.385 --> 20:06.418
That sounds fun.

20:06.419 --> 20:07.553
Look, if we're going
to do this,

20:07.554 --> 20:09.388
we're gonna have
to have a couple of rules.

20:09.389 --> 20:11.190
Rule number one,
starting right now:

20:11.191 --> 20:12.491
No work talk.

20:12.492 --> 20:14.393
Perfect, we can just skip
straight to making out

20:14.394 --> 20:18.340
on your desk.

20:18.341 --> 20:22.000
Yeah, that's not my desk.
This is.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.268
Copy that.

20:23.269 --> 20:25.104
Blame it on the janitor
and make a break for it?

20:25.105 --> 20:27.681
Absolutely.
After you.

20:29.075 --> 20:32.771
Charles, I'm sorry that neither
of us have the room.

20:32.772 --> 20:36.815
Yes. I, too, am disappointed
by this unfortunate stalemate.

20:36.816 --> 20:39.084
Why are you talking
all victorian?

20:39.085 --> 20:41.053
You're lying about something.
That's what that means.

20:41.054 --> 20:43.112
Nonsense, m'lady.

20:43.113 --> 20:46.659
Okay, fine... I might not be
in that hotel room right now,

20:46.660 --> 20:48.412
but my Gene pool is.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.261
Ew.

20:49.262 --> 20:50.664
What'd you do
in there?

20:50.665 --> 20:52.333
I gave the hotel room
to my father

20:52.334 --> 20:54.792
and told him to check in
under my name.

20:54.798 --> 20:58.337
What? No!
I gave my key to my mom!

20:59.386 --> 21:00.706
Hey.

21:00.707 --> 21:02.641
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong room.

21:02.642 --> 21:04.043
That's okay.

21:04.044 --> 21:06.478
Hey, wait a second,
do we know each other?

21:06.479 --> 21:07.846
Is your daughter Gina?

21:07.847 --> 21:11.483
Yes! And you're that
little man's father, Boyle.

21:11.484 --> 21:12.484
Yeah.

21:12.485 --> 21:14.186
We met at the family
food drive.

21:14.187 --> 21:15.587
I'm Darlene Linetti.

21:15.588 --> 21:19.525
Lynn Boyle,
pleased to re-meet you.

21:19.526 --> 21:21.226
So what do you think's
going on here?

21:21.227 --> 21:22.294
Mix up or something?

21:22.295 --> 21:23.862
I don't know.

21:23.863 --> 21:25.064
Regina's been
encouraging me

21:25.065 --> 21:29.568
to have some...
Romantic adventures.

21:29.569 --> 21:30.703
Holy cow.
