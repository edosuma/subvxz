WEBVTT

00:11.928 --> 00:14.723
-Mm. Good smoothies, Claire.
-Thanks.

00:14.806 --> 00:18.184
I dropped some gummy worms
in there and just went with it.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.937
We might need a new blender.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.443
Hey, Jayden. How are you doing?

00:26.526 --> 00:30.572
How would you be if the Internet troll
who preyed upon your ankle insecurity

00:30.655 --> 00:33.616
and baited you into posting
a humiliating clapback video

00:33.700 --> 00:37.537
turned out to be your estranged mother
with whom you'd not spoken in years?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.207
Yes, I hate when that happens.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.254
I had no idea things were so bad
between you and your mom.

00:46.337 --> 00:50.050
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened between you two?

00:53.386 --> 00:55.346
-Give him space!
-What's going on?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.268
It's too difficult for Jayden
to tell the story with words,

01:00.351 --> 01:02.937
-so he tells it with dance.
-Okay.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.108
Jayden came out of his
mother's womb with a pointed toe.

01:07.984 --> 01:11.196
It was a medical emergency,
but a performance marvel.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.365
That's when his mother knew
he was talented.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.743
She became his manager,
and he started modeling.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.912
And their careers took off.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.956
He walked the runway
at every Kohl's in the United States.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.252
They were booking gigs,
making money, living the fast life

01:26.336 --> 01:29.047
all the way into Jayden's teens.

01:29.547 --> 01:33.468
Jayden grew to resent his mom's
domineering, momagerial style.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.055
She made him practice
his runway walks over and over,

01:37.138 --> 01:39.307
constantly nit-picking every move.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.143
The pressure was so high
that he used to pull at his earlobe,

01:42.227 --> 01:46.231
which stretched it enough to mess up
his perfectly symmetrical face.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.527
With all that pressure from his mom,
Jayden reached a breaking point.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.487
He felt like a wilting flower.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.241
Wow. That was-- Oh, it's not over.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.659
This part's new.

01:57.742 --> 02:02.163
Uh, they haven't spoken since
he fired her, and now she's...

02:02.247 --> 02:03.748
blackmailing him?

02:03.832 --> 02:08.128
She's demanding he meet her in person
if he wants the trolling to stop.

02:15.718 --> 02:16.553
Holy sh--

02:26.479 --> 02:28.690
Hey, where's pottery Dave?

02:28.773 --> 02:30.608
I noticed he slept over again last night

02:30.692 --> 02:33.695
because your stuffed animal friends
were crammed under the sink.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.779
He's getting ready.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.867
He's very passionate about brushing
each sector of his mouth for 30 seconds.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.119
You have been seeing
a lot of each other, huh?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.203
Yeah.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.454
Hey, everyone.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.290
-Dave.
-Hey, Dave.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.458
Dude, I finally saw that movie
you recommended.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.793
-Titanic?
-Yeah.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.296
It's crazy what people come up with.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.966
Oh! I almost forgot.
Claire, I have a gift for you.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.301
Aw, you shouldn't have.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.928
Ta-da! A vase.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.265
-Oh, I love that you stuck with pottery.
-Oh, thanks.

03:02.348 --> 03:06.519
The teacher said, while I'm not improving,
I am wasting a lot of clay.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.229
I think it's perfect.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.025
Ha. I think you two are the cutest.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.652
And I find straight kissing inappropriate.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.364
Hey, what is that, Grant? Smells great.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.741
Mm.

03:19.824 --> 03:20.992
My mom's casserole.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.454
Every year, she sends a bunch of pans
from Nebraska for me to freeze.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.498
Jayden's mom dance
made me think about my mom,

03:27.582 --> 03:28.917
so I had to eat some.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.045
You want a slice, Jay?
Might make you feel better.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.922
It has 47 ingredients.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.257
The second most important one is love.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.509
The most important one... is Velveeta.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.180
No, thanks. I'm fine.
You don't have to worry about me.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.058
I just have to have a sit-down
with the woman who gave me life

03:45.141 --> 03:47.101
and then systematically
tried to destroy it.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.688
You're not thinking
of meeting up with her, are you?

03:50.772 --> 03:53.316
I don't have a choice.
It's classic Jasmine.

03:53.399 --> 03:57.779
The exact tactic she used to ensure
I was named Homecoming King every year,

03:57.862 --> 04:00.698
including the year
the quarterback got paralyzed

04:00.782 --> 04:03.368
and everyone wanted to "rally around him."

04:04.827 --> 04:08.206
Be careful. It sounds like
you guys have a toxic dynamic.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.208
Don't worry, I'm fully prepared.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.419
I will not let her suck me
into any of her mind games.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.881
I'm taking a scooter so I can approach
the restaurant through the alley.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.634
Or I could give you a ride.
I'm headed out now.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.762
Dave, you continue to be the best.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.348
-See you later.
-Bye.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.851
I love him.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.647
Oh, I'm so happy Jayden likes Dave.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.816
Why wouldn't he? Dave is awesome.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.568
He explained to me what a 401is.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.070
Still have no idea.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.698
You like him too.
Chelsea, what do you think?

04:41.781 --> 04:42.949
Yeah, Dave's great.

04:43.032 --> 04:47.537
He's got the sweetness of a Mister Rogers
but the sex appeal of a...

04:48.496 --> 04:49.872
well, a Mister Rogers.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.874
That's so good to hear.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.334
-Solana?
-Yes?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.753
-Do you like Dave too?
-I'm not sure.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.005
Good.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.882
Wait, what? Not really sure?

05:10.977 --> 05:11.853
Hello, Mother.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.480
Jayden, sweetie.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.690
Come, sit.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.569
I ordered you a Pellegrino. With lemon.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.780
That's how I like it.
What's the point of bubbles

05:22.864 --> 05:25.700
-without a little zing?
-Without a little zing?

05:25.783 --> 05:27.535
Look at us two.

05:27.618 --> 05:28.911
Don't I know my son?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.164
Let's get you your favorite cruditÃ©.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.708
Okay. I could go for a gherkin.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.335
What-- Oh, God, no.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.130
I will not let you lure me
into some false sense of security.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.923
You are blackmailing me.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.051
Why am I here?

05:43.676 --> 05:45.011
I just wanted to talk.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.929
I've been watching your career,

05:47.013 --> 05:50.391
and I am concerned
with the direction it's taken.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.770
Look how poorly you handled
this ankle-gate thing.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.189
You're the one who created ankle-gate!

05:56.272 --> 05:58.149
And I'm the one who can fix it.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.903
Jayden, sweetie...

06:02.403 --> 06:04.447
I want to manage you again.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.406
Hmm?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.825
I'm-- I'm sorry?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.495
And this is how you tell me?

06:11.412 --> 06:13.581
I didn't know how else
to get in touch with you.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.583
You ignore my calls and e-mails,

06:15.666 --> 06:17.794
and the one time I saw you at the airport,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.254
you jumped into an x-ray machine
so we couldn't talk.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.714
And I'm glad I did.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.425
That's how I found out
"hands up, feet apart"

06:24.509 --> 06:26.469
is one of my most flattering poses.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.431
I'm sorry I had to go to such
extreme lengths to get you here,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.308
but you left me no choice.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.061
What do you say?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.187
What do I say?

06:36.813 --> 06:37.855
I say, no.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.024
Absolutely not.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.361
I will not fall for your charms,
and I don't need you anymore.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.905
I live in a house that has a snack drawer.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.907
Oh! Without a lock!

06:49.700 --> 06:51.244
Goodbye, Jasmine.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.163
That's too bad, Jayden,
because I have Nike.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.666
Did you say Nike?

07:04.173 --> 07:07.510
-Wow. You know, you're inspiring me.
-To work out?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.178
No, to have ice cream.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.434
Oh. Freezer drawer was left open.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.352
Oh, God, not for long, I hope.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.646
All my mom's casseroles are in there.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.941
Mama's casserole!

07:24.819 --> 07:26.446
Can't you just refreeze it?

07:26.529 --> 07:31.284
No. It's made with unpasteurized dairy
from my family cow, Doris.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.995
You can't refreeze those. It'll go bad.

07:34.078 --> 07:37.707
Six trays of my mother's love
and hard work will go to waste.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.376
I have to eat it.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.383
You're going to eat a year's-worth
of dairy-heavy casserole in a day?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.260
I can't live with myself if I don't.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.054
I'm not sure I'll be able
to live with you if you do.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.477
Hey. Is now a good time to talk?

07:57.560 --> 08:01.689
Sure, but be careful what you say,
desert plants are always listening.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.566
Okay.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.863
Um, so I probably misread this,
but when everyone said they liked Dave

08:08.946 --> 08:11.908
and you said you weren't sure,
you meant you liked him too, right?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.160
Like, sometimes
how people say, "I'm not sure,"

08:14.243 --> 08:16.162
but they mean, "I like him too"?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.123
I don't mess with affairs of the heart.

08:19.207 --> 08:23.878
I'm not asking you as a guru,
I'm asking you as one of my best friends.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.713
Your opinion is important.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.590
Don't you trust your feelings?

08:27.673 --> 08:28.758
Well, I mean...

08:29.509 --> 08:33.262
I do have a history of not making
the best relationship choices.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.515
But, yeah, I trust my feelings.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.058
But I also trust yours.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.853
Well, to be honest,
I don't really know Dave.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.898
You know him. Dave!

08:43.981 --> 08:46.150
Loves a chicken parm,
always keeps floss on him,

08:46.234 --> 08:48.819
has season tickets to a trampoline
slam-dunk league. Dave.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.406
I know who you're talking about,
I just don't "know him" know him.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.536
If you want, we could hang out.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.330
Just the three of us.
That way, I can tell you what I think.

08:59.413 --> 09:03.042
Oh, that would be so great. Thank you.
Okay, bye, Solana.

09:03.918 --> 09:04.961
Bye, cactus.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.095
One down, five to go.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.139
Feeling great, Chels. Do you want some?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.726
Oh. No, thanks.
I try to stay away from foods

09:20.810 --> 09:22.520
that are on the verge of curdling.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.815
Hey, how did it go?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.483
Great.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.653
Oh, I'm so glad. You should be proud
of yourself for standing up to--

09:30.736 --> 09:32.405
I re-signed with her.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.031
Jayden?

09:34.115 --> 09:37.368
I don't know how,
but she got me this campaign for--

09:37.451 --> 09:39.161
Pausing for dramatic effect.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.496
--Nike!

09:41.455 --> 09:42.873
Nice, Jay.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.294
I stood up too fast.
That's a casserole no-no.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.256
This campaign is perfect for me.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.425
They're debuting
a gender-neutral sports purse,

09:52.508 --> 09:55.678
and everyone knows
I look amazing with carrying wear.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.222
My mom is coming over
to help me try on different looks

09:58.306 --> 10:00.433
before the reps from Nike get here.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.601
That sounds great.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.895
But aren't you worried about falling back
into those unhealthy patterns

10:04.979 --> 10:07.523
you so eloquently
danced about this morning?

10:08.357 --> 10:11.319
Did you not hear me
when I said that it's Nike?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.446
Yeah, Nike!

10:17.575 --> 10:18.826
It kind of tickles.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.536
Tickles? Interesting.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.290
Dave, what is your birthday,
time of birth,

10:24.373 --> 10:28.002
and which direction was your mother's
canal facing when you entered this world?

10:28.085 --> 10:32.006
Uh... February 15, around 3 p.m.,

10:32.089 --> 10:34.717
and I try not to ask
my mom about her vagina.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.803
Solana, can I talk to you for a sec?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.181
Over there, where Dave can't hear us?

10:43.517 --> 10:46.103
Make sure to keep your thoughts
entirely about the eagles,

10:46.187 --> 10:48.981
-or we'll start all over.
-The football team or the band?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.691
The bird, Dave!

10:52.735 --> 10:55.321
What's going on?
I thought you wanted to get to know Dave,

10:55.404 --> 10:57.823
not freak him out
so he'll never want to see me again.

10:57.907 --> 11:02.411
I can stop if you want, but I wouldn't
be able to tell you if I like him.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.581
No, no, keep going, I guess.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.210
Okay, then. I'm going to need
some one-on-one time,

11:09.293 --> 11:12.672
-so I'll be taking Dave to a sweat lodge.
-What?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.092
A man can only truly be honest
when his pores are open

11:16.175 --> 11:19.220
and his back is tired from sitting
crisscross applesauce.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.181
I guess that's fine, but please be nice.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.432
-Of course.
-Okay.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.852
All right, Dave, the weird stuff is over.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.398
Now put on this blindfold
and walk backwards into my car.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.411
I've never seen you labor this hard,
not even during deadlifts.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.205
Not that I'm watching you
while you exercise.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.959
I'm in a tremendous amount of pain.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.752
But I've got to push through for Mom.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.964
You know, she'd really like you.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.590
Yeah? Why?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.426
Because she likes everyone.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.137
Uh-oh.

12:01.220 --> 12:06.142
My belly button just went outie.
That can't be good.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.061
Okay. I think it's time to stop, really.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
No. I've got this.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.490
Okay, all right, that's it.
Hand me a fork, I'm jumping in.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.450
Are you sure?

12:22.533 --> 12:25.703
Just consider it
my calcium intake for the year.

12:25.786 --> 12:29.331
-I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.086
-Hello.
-Hi, Mom.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.797
Oh, your place is cute.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.424
Teal with yellow accents.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.593
Reminds me of your signature look.

12:40.676 --> 12:44.805
Teal polo layered under a yellow polo,
both collars popped, and...

12:44.889 --> 12:46.474
Puka shells!

12:46.557 --> 12:48.642
That was a great look, Mommy.

12:49.685 --> 12:54.565
Grant, Chelsea, I'd like to introduce you
to a very special lady in my life.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.900
My manager.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.612
Jasmine Jay J. Meixiu Jiang. Pleasure.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.988
Hi. Grant.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.574
Hello, Chelsea, nice to meet you.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.367
This isn't our typical snack.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.579
Normally, we have... gummy worm smoothies.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.582
Wonderful to meet you both.

13:11.665 --> 13:15.711
Jayden, let's see what flatters
before the Nike people arrive.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.799
Are you asking for a Jayden J. Jay
Michael Jiang fashion show?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.926
Indeed, I am.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.641
I don't think this is going to end well.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.519
You'll probably have a tummy ache,
but it'll be worth it.

13:35.731 --> 13:40.361
Yes, hello, Solana.
It's me, Claire, your roommate.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.278
You know who I am.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.697
Uh, this is my fourth voicemail.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.784
I just wanted to see when you
might be done getting to know Dave,

13:46.867 --> 13:49.954
and to make sure you weren't
totally freaking him out

13:50.037 --> 13:52.832
or making him drink some weird elixir,

13:52.915 --> 13:55.960
or using those leeches
you always talk about.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.673
You know what?
I'll come. I will be there soon.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.050
Okay, I love you, bye. This is Claire.

14:07.471 --> 14:11.058
To your mother's
endless devotion to milk fat.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.729
May it not kill us mid-tray,
like my Uncle Larry.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.568
I'm sorry, what?

14:22.027 --> 14:25.364
Grant, sweetie, have you ever
thought about modeling?

14:25.447 --> 14:27.157
Thought about it? No.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.660
But I have been on the cover
of a few magazines.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.289
Mommy? You ready?

14:33.914 --> 14:35.082
Bring it, baby.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.588
Oh! That's it.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.214
That's my Jay-Jay.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.258
And chin! There it is.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.973
Calvin Klein, not Kevin Kline.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.433
Right. Sorry.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.151
Wear the purse.
Don't let the purse wear you.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.694
Okay. I'm sorry.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.658
Honey, you have the body of a dancer
and the face of a baby doll.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.162
We don't want to throw all that away
by walking like a goblin, do we?

15:13.245 --> 15:17.041
No. "Walking like a goblin,"
that's a great note, thank you.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.459
Use it.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.881
-Stop, stop, stop.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.133
We're selling Nike, not ChapStick.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.677
Oh, I just thought I'd have fun with it.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.305
And what do we say about fun?

15:32.848 --> 15:36.852
Fun is a concept that ugly people made up
to feel better about eating nachos.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.979
That's right.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.608
-Let's try it again, shall we?
-Right. I'm sorry.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.069
Oh, my God.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.906
My lopsided earlobe. It's happening again.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.702
The wilting flower!

15:55.371 --> 15:57.122
It blooms!

15:59.875 --> 16:00.709
Mommy...

16:02.336 --> 16:03.379
I can't do this.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.721
That's what Uncle Larry said
before we lost him.

16:17.017 --> 16:17.851
Solana.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.606
I'm trying to knock
but this material is too soft! Solana!

16:23.899 --> 16:25.025
Is something wrong?

16:26.443 --> 16:28.737
Yes, something is wrong.
You won't answer my calls.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.197
-Is Dave conscious?
-He's fine.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.491
Well, get him out of there.
He dehydrates easily!

16:32.574 --> 16:34.118
You wanted to know if I like Dave.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.078
I don't care if you like Dave,

16:36.161 --> 16:39.164
because I like Dave,
and that's all that matters!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.251
Why are you clapping?

16:43.794 --> 16:47.256
Did I perform a monologue
from Dawson's Creek again?

16:48.132 --> 16:51.176
No, I'm clapping
because you figured it out.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.136
I'm proud of you.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.805
Wait a second. So--

16:54.888 --> 16:57.975
So you tortured him all day
with total nonsense

16:58.058 --> 17:01.979
just to help me realize that
I don't need anyone else's approval?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.606
That is so nice.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.360
I wasn't torturing him.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.278
Dave!

17:10.195 --> 17:12.406
She didn't even turn on the heat.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.034
I did get sweaty in my pits,
but that's me anywhere.

17:15.117 --> 17:15.951
Oh, honey.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.703
We played backgammon the whole time.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.039
-You mean you cheated the whole time.
-I did not.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.332
Wait, are you guys friends now?

17:22.416 --> 17:24.710
Yes, Claire, because I like Dave.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.003
Well, I don't care.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.380
But also, yay!

17:28.464 --> 17:29.381
Oh...

17:36.430 --> 17:38.348
-Jayden...
-Let me guess,

17:38.432 --> 17:40.851
you came out here to give me more notes.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.854
Did I not storm out of the room properly?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.315
Do I have broccoli in my teeth?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.609
Wait. Do I have broccoli in my teeth?

17:50.736 --> 17:51.695
No, Jayden.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.698
Listen.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.328
The day that you were born was...

17:59.995 --> 18:01.789
the scariest day of my life.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.584
Not how I was hoping
that sentence would end.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.171
No, not because you weren't amazing,

18:09.254 --> 18:12.883
and not because I didn't
instantly fall in love with you.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.343
I did.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.344
But...

18:17.930 --> 18:21.308
I was scared because
I didn't know how to be a mother.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.561
It didn't come naturally to me.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.899
Yeah. My teacher always
thought it was weird

18:28.982 --> 18:32.319
you'd pack a wedge salad
and a tonic water for my lunch.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.989
Being your manager,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.576
that, I could do.
I had something to offer.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.538
Why are you telling me this?

18:42.621 --> 18:43.622
Jayden...

18:45.499 --> 18:47.292
Nike doesn't exist.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.628
What?

18:50.295 --> 18:53.715
Then who made the shorts
I've been wearing this whole time?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.260
No, no, I mean...

18:58.512 --> 18:59.972
I made up the campaign.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.810
Why?

19:06.687 --> 19:10.482
I was just so happy to see you
earlier in the restaurant.

19:10.983 --> 19:15.445
And when you started walking out,
I made it up so I wouldn't lose you again.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.701
So the trolling and the blackmail...?

19:20.784 --> 19:23.745
It was all about seeing you.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.294
I miss you, Jayden.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.213
I miss you so much.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.259
I miss you too, Mom.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.472
And I was kind of excited
to spend time with you again.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.350
I guess that's why
I said yes to this thing,

19:46.310 --> 19:47.978
but it can't be like this...

19:48.937 --> 19:53.025
judging and nit-picking
and calling me Kevin Kline.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.779
It's not what a mother does with a son.

19:59.907 --> 20:00.741
So...

20:02.492 --> 20:03.535
What if we--

20:04.161 --> 20:05.120
And hear me out.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.625
--had a relationship
without you being my manager?

20:10.792 --> 20:13.795
Oh. Like I'm your accountant?

20:15.797 --> 20:16.632
No.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.968
No, you're just like...

20:22.262 --> 20:23.263
my mom.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.435
What do you say?

20:31.021 --> 20:34.107
Yes. I like the sound of that.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.280
I love you, Jayden.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.950
I love you too, Mom.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.123
I'm never eating dairy again.

20:50.207 --> 20:54.002
In fact, I don't think I'm ever
eating anything ever again.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.004
I should be good in a few hours.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.509
You know what's weird?
I think I'm starting to see

21:00.592 --> 21:02.636
-some of Doris the cow's memories.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.472
-Ow! Don't make me laugh.
-Sorry.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.308
Hey, guys. Hungry?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.810
Oh, starved.

21:09.893 --> 21:13.063
You really work up a sweat
banging on a yurt.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.819
Oh, our wilted flower. How are you?

21:19.444 --> 21:20.821
I'm being really brave.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.617
It's gonna be a long journey,
but my mom and I will take things slow.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.829
Like, the Catholic Church and progress.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.667
You must be hungry after all that
emotional and physical strutting.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.876
I am.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.877
You're in luck.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.256
-Mom's casserole for the whole family.
-Okay. Thank you.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.426
Oh, my God.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.263
Is this what a well-adjusted
childhood tastes like?

21:48.307 --> 21:51.268
It can only be described through...

21:52.102 --> 21:55.272
Oh, interpretative dance.
It's happening again.
