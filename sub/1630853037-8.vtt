WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:06.047
(chuckles)
Swan.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.258
I don't need anything
from New York.

00:08.299 --> 00:10.969
No, just-just have fun
with your brother.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.432
Yeah.
(chuckles)

00:15.473 --> 00:17.434
I miss you, too.

00:17.475 --> 00:20.186
Okay. Bye.

00:25.316 --> 00:30.030
Which veggie can either break
a hex or make you fall in love,

00:30.071 --> 00:32.240
but it'll always
spice up your life?

00:32.282 --> 00:34.492
Uh... Oh, uh, chili peppers?

00:34.534 --> 00:35.660
(laughs)

00:35.702 --> 00:37.579
Damn. I thought I had you.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.122
(laughs softly)

00:43.501 --> 00:45.503
RUBY:
How did he find us?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.672
Don't know. Just run.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.009
Hello, Sunshine.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.302
(gasps)

00:56.514 --> 00:59.142
Stay the hell away
from us, Earl.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.562
I'm sorry, Patty-Cakes,
but I can't do that.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.481
You see, we're a family.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.485
And family
always sticks together.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.779
You were never part
of this family.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.238
Oh!
Now, Sunshine,

01:12.280 --> 01:14.074
that's no way to talk
to your father.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.242
You could never fill
my dad's shoes,

01:16.284 --> 01:17.660
even with a clone,

01:17.702 --> 01:20.121
you abusive piece...
Ruby, storm spell.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.457
BOTH:
Dearest Indra, god of storms,

01:22.499 --> 01:24.834
help us conjure
weathering storms.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.669
Winds that sweep,
make them swarm!

01:26.711 --> 01:28.505
(wind blowing)

01:35.303 --> 01:37.555
Mom! What are you doing?

01:37.597 --> 01:39.766
I'm sorry, baby, but we can't
keep living like this.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.186
Witchness Protection
is our only chance.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.479
But...

01:44.521 --> 01:46.397
a life without magic?

01:46.439 --> 01:49.025
Is better than a life
looking over our shoulders.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.735
Go!

02:09.129 --> 02:11.214
(piano playing softly)

02:16.511 --> 02:19.180
This is why I do
all my shopping online.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.557
Well, good luck
finding a sacred,

02:20.598 --> 02:23.059
magical bowl on the Internet.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.811
Fair point.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.230
Clearly, your father
didn't realize

02:27.272 --> 02:29.482
what he had on his hands
with this Unity Bowl.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.776
Can we not talk about
Ray right now?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.528
Well, Maggie, I'm sure he didn't
tell you about his heart

02:33.570 --> 02:34.988
because he didn't
want to worry you.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.657
Well, mission
un-accomplished.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.826
I'd strangle him if I wasn't
so worried about the curse

02:39.868 --> 02:42.620
killing him first.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.664
I know.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.084
But right now, we need to stay
focused on the Unity Bowl.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.920
If we could assemble it,
we might find the instructions

02:50.962 --> 02:53.089
for how to break his curse.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.092
And from what I can tell,

02:56.134 --> 02:59.470
the other half of it
was sold here a decade ago.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.140
Right. You take that row,
I'll take this one.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.027
Nothing ominous about that.

turns out getting
your thumb cut off

03:55.276 --> 03:58.863
and then magically reattached
kind of hurts like a bitch.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.615
Hmm. Sorry.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.075
Jordan's still off
keeping Ray alive,

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
so you're just gonna
have to stick

04:03.534 --> 04:04.827
with good old-fashioned ice
for now.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.621
How are you otherwise?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.665
Oh, you know... (chuckles)

04:08.706 --> 04:11.167
just obsessively watching
the magical life

04:11.209 --> 04:14.587
I almost had on repeat.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.672
How many times have you
done the provenance spell

04:15.713 --> 04:18.716
on your baby blanket?

04:18.758 --> 04:19.884
Thirty-seven.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.760
Damn.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.928
I know.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.932
(sighs) At least I got
their license plate out of it.

04:25.974 --> 04:30.311
It's 26 years out of date,
but it's a clue.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.355
My dad's got this buddy--
ChooChi.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.565
An ex-cop who's helped us
with this sort of thing before.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.109
Yeah, thank you, but...

04:36.150 --> 04:37.527
(sighs)

04:39.445 --> 04:42.448
What if they don't
want to meet me?

04:43.491 --> 04:46.369
Kaela.
I mean, they did give me up.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.246
But it may not be
for the reason that you think.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.998
For all we know,
they could have stashed you away

04:50.039 --> 04:52.125
because some
dark wizard was after you.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.835
I'm pretty sure
that's Harry Potter.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.671
Fine. But you get the point.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.298
We are going to find them,

04:58.339 --> 05:00.300
and when we do,
this is all gonna make sense.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.635
Us, our connection,
why you're a Charmed One--

05:02.677 --> 05:04.721
they'll have the answers.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.473
I'm gonna head back
to the command center,

05:07.515 --> 05:08.808
see if Maggie's back yet.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.310
Hey, you want some company?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.854
You just focus on you,
all right?

05:12.895 --> 05:14.772
Okay.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.914
May I help you with something?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.252
Yes.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.920
I'm looking for any information
you might have

05:37.962 --> 05:41.049
about an old artifact
called the Unity Bowl.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.720
I managed to acquire
one half of it.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.349
I was told the other half
was sold here some time ago.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.517
I'm not in the habit

05:51.559 --> 05:54.520
of divulging
my clients' information.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.439
But for the right price...

05:56.481 --> 06:00.068
Mm. I could make an exception.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.944
Good.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.156
Any luck?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.116
You.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.826
What?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.454
You're not welcome here,
Charmed One.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.705
Seriously?

06:12.747 --> 06:15.166
Both of you need
to leave my shop now.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.835
We're trying to save
my dad's life.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.295
Of course you are.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.838
Selfish spa queen.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.757
Excuse me?
Maggie,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.467
let's just get out of here.
MAGGIE: No, no, no.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.512
Not till Krazy Kermit shows me
what's on that scroll.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.519
That's mine, you fascist.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.105
What the hell are you doing?

06:40.858 --> 06:42.777
(sniffles)

06:45.696 --> 06:48.825
Hey. You okay?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.870
Oh, what is it?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.497
He... I don't...

06:54.539 --> 06:57.500
I don't know how, but, um...

06:57.542 --> 06:58.876
he found me.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.461
Who?

07:00.503 --> 07:02.588
My demon stepdad.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.800
He's back.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.347
Why won't it come off?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.015
Bloody hell.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.393
I could've gotten
super-speed or,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.311
I don't know,
invisibility, but...

07:17.353 --> 07:19.480
(strains)
...I had to mimic

07:19.522 --> 07:22.358
literally the worst power
on Earth.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.026
You need to relax.
I am relaxed!

07:26.988 --> 07:28.614
(panting)

07:31.117 --> 07:33.578
Sorry.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.080
(exhales)
I'm just so tired

07:36.122 --> 07:38.708
of people who don't even know me
gossiping about me.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.001
Spreading lies.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.087
You can't let them
get to you like that.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.255
Whoever's behind all this,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.591
it's what they want.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.427
I know that, but
I can't help it.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
Just like I can't make
these stupid powers go away

07:51.512 --> 07:53.306
for some reason.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.851
Maybe if I can figure out what
that sticky-fingered psycho was,

07:56.893 --> 08:00.396
I could control them somehow?

08:00.438 --> 08:02.607
Let me help you.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.819
And, no. No.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.156
Let me see.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.870
Ah.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.540
The Loveland frog.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.209
"Foul-tempered amphibian

08:21.250 --> 08:23.878
"indigenous to Ohio.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.464
Secretes a sticky..."

08:26.506 --> 08:28.466
Oh, I don't even know
how to pronounce that.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.009
Batrachotoxin. A lethal poison,

08:30.051 --> 08:31.969
Like his much smaller cousin
the dart frog.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.304
This just keeps getting better.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.516
Well, it says here
it's only fatal to humans.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.683
Magical creatures are immune.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.310
Oh, good.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.146
So I'm persona non grata
in the magical world,

08:42.188 --> 08:45.024
and Miss Murder Fingers
in the human world.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.943
It's not all bad.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.654
If those powers hadn't made your
hand stick to the sales ledger,

08:49.695 --> 08:51.447
we never would have
gotten away with it.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.658
So, there's that.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.789
You were saying?

09:01.249 --> 09:02.875
Ah.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.919
Just when I think
it is finally safe

09:04.961 --> 09:06.921
to live my life like
a normal person,

09:06.963 --> 09:10.967
wham-- I get a bouquet
of damn sunflowers.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.219
Are you sure
they're not from Swan?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.762
(exhales)

09:14.804 --> 09:16.764
He left a note.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.269
"I've missed you, Sunshine."

09:21.310 --> 09:23.145
Well, that's not creepy.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.565
Do you think this is
'cause of my campaign?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.775
Demons don't usually pay
attention to human politics,

09:27.817 --> 09:30.152
but what if, uh...

09:31.404 --> 09:32.738
What if he saw my photo

09:32.780 --> 09:34.615
on-on the Internet
or something?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.742
Oh, my God.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.787
I know how he found you.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.247
Wh... How?

09:41.289 --> 09:44.500
It wasn't because
of your campaign.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.836
It was because of me.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.130
MAGGIE:
This is so weird.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.757
How did he sell the same bowl

09:51.799 --> 09:53.676
four times in less
than 20 years?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.886
If Ray's curse
is any indication,

09:55.928 --> 09:58.723
each buyer likely died
after purchasing the bowl.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.225
Then our amphibious friend would
simply retrieve and resell it.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.643
Sociopath.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.896
Last purchased April 20, 2015.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.357
Any info on the buyer?

10:08.399 --> 10:11.402
Uh, just the initials D.B.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.946
Oh, there's a third letter here,
too, but it's been smudged.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.740
Whoa.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.003
Whoa.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
Uh, this isn't ink.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.132
This is blood.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.259
And if my new powers
are activating...

10:36.969 --> 10:38.304
It's the blood
of a dead person.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.890
(door opens)
MEL: Guys.

10:40.931 --> 10:44.226
We have a serious problem.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.522
The hit list is out.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.193
We found them. All the known
associates of the Charmed Ones.

10:52.234 --> 10:55.446
And we, the Unseen,
will bring these tyrants

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
and their sympathizers down

10:57.531 --> 11:00.660
by any means necessary!

11:00.701 --> 11:04.580
And we can start right here.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.258
I don't know how,
but they have the names

11:16.300 --> 11:17.468
of everyone we care about.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.178
They know where we live.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.721
They even know Kaela
was adopted and they're looking

11:20.763 --> 11:22.139
for her bio-parents.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.808
We have to warn Kaela.
ChooChi's got a lead

11:23.849 --> 11:25.518
on her parents,
but you should get home

11:25.559 --> 11:26.811
and put a seal on the house.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.062
What about you?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.939
Do you remember blindaje dolls?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.900
Yeah, they're, like,
a one-time use,

11:32.942 --> 11:34.360
get-out-of-death
free card, right?

11:34.402 --> 11:36.070
MEL:
Yep. And it's
the perfect way to protect

11:36.112 --> 11:37.947
a lot of people at once.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.408
Only problem, the spell was
in the O.G. Book of Shadows,

11:40.449 --> 11:41.951
which went up in flames

11:41.992 --> 11:43.619
in Hilltowne.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.788
Well, good thing I can move
objects through time.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.416
You go handle Kaela.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.583
I got this.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.293
And I'll do what I can

11:51.335 --> 11:53.379
about finding the other half
of the bowl.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.466
Hey, Rubes.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.553
Do you want to see me defy
the laws of time and space?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.684
(laughs): Hey!

12:06.726 --> 12:07.852
No.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.020
I'm Kaela. Michaela. Yo.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.522
(British accent):
Hello love. Isn't this crazy?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.941
That was weird,
I'm not even British.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.609
(regular accent): I'm your
daughter. I'm your daughter.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.486
I'm your daughter.
My thumb got cut off.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.988
(laughs)
Because I'm a witch.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.282
A Charmed One.
What kind of witch are you?

12:21.323 --> 12:23.117
(door opens)

12:25.911 --> 12:27.663
I don't think we were followed.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.915
Let's just find Kaela,
make sure she's okay.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.127
Why wouldn't I be okay?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.973
Okay, sprinkle some sage
on the candle.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.768
I'd do it myself, but...

12:48.809 --> 12:50.227
Ugh!

12:50.269 --> 12:51.812
Should I even ask?

12:51.854 --> 12:54.899
Nope.
We've got bigger frogs to fry.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.109
(groans) Welcome
to the busted hands club.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.828
That should keep

13:07.870 --> 13:10.039
the house protected
while we go find your parents.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.249
Sounds great.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.462
Hey. It's okay

13:16.504 --> 13:19.298
to not be okay
with all this bio-parents stuff.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.674
What? It's fine.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.301
I'm fine.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.386
Kaela.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.973
You're this close
to figuring out who you are.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.517
Why you're a Charmed One.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.935
And now your parents
might be in danger.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.561
I mean, that's a lot to take in.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.648
Okay. Okay.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.734
Suppose that we do find them.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.904
What am I supposed to say?

13:41.946 --> 13:45.449
How about "hi"?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.369
Right. Um, okay. Hi.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.996
Right.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.998
And then do I hug them?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.917
I...
What if they're not huggers?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.419
They've got to be some
magical species. I mean, maybe

13:57.461 --> 14:00.172
if I manifest them something
and gave it to them...
Kaela.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.507
You're overanalyzing.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.092
Yeah, of course
I'm overanalyzing.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.305
Okay, well,
think of it this way.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.349
Even if it's not
under the best circumstances,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.518
at least you still get

14:12.560 --> 14:14.270
to meet your parents.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.859
My bio-dad, Dexter, died
before I even knew he existed.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.615
Life is too short
to let fear rule our lives.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.617
Sometimes we just have to

14:28.659 --> 14:30.661
jump and see where we land.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.247
Yeah, you're right.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.707
Hmm.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.917
(phone buzzes, chimes)

14:39.545 --> 14:41.255
Good.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.425
'Cause your parents' names
are Zephyr and Carolyn Vales.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.510
And they live in Georgia.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.513
Let's do this.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.644
♪ ♪

15:18.584 --> 15:20.085
(laughs)

15:20.127 --> 15:21.503
So, so...

15:21.545 --> 15:23.172
so that's really the...

15:23.213 --> 15:26.425
Original Book
of Shadows.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
Eventually,
I'll have to return it

15:28.385 --> 15:30.095
to the exact time and place.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.681
Can't go unraveling the
space-time continuum, right?

15:32.723 --> 15:34.892
Right. But for now,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.186
watch this.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.522
Show me how to make
blindaje dolls.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.616
Who are you?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.000
Full disclosure.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.585
Drop the shield.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.672
All the secrets be revealed.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.176
"DBV."

16:11.387 --> 16:14.098
Time to see who you really are.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.311
(gasps)

16:21.397 --> 16:23.482
(overlapping whispers)

16:49.675 --> 16:51.760
MAN:
You shouldn't be here, Harry.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.727
Dexter?

17:08.944 --> 17:10.571
(both exhale)

17:10.612 --> 17:12.114
Okay.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.866
Mel needs names,

17:13.907 --> 17:16.577
birthdays, and species
for the blindaje dolls.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.245
We've got the first two
thanks to ChooChi.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.372
That just leaves...

17:20.414 --> 17:22.499
Species.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.585
(exhales)

17:24.626 --> 17:26.336
(sighs)

17:26.378 --> 17:28.464
This is really happening.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.216
If you're too nervous,
I can go in first

17:31.258 --> 17:32.676
to get the info Mel needs.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.470
to protect them from
whatever unseen evil

17:34.511 --> 17:36.388
are trying to kill them.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.557
Then, when you feel ready,

17:38.599 --> 17:40.350
you can come inside.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.478
No.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.856
I want to do this.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.777
I need to do this.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.697
(knocking)

18:00.788 --> 18:02.539
Afternoon.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.291
Hi.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.335
Can I help y'all
with something?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.670
Um...

18:08.712 --> 18:11.048
Yeah, actually, um,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.675
our car broke down
and our phones are dead.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.427
And...

18:15.469 --> 18:18.013
so we-we were just...

18:18.055 --> 18:19.681
wondering if we could
maybe use yours?

18:19.723 --> 18:21.225
(chuckles)

18:24.603 --> 18:27.022
Uh, sure. Uh, come on in.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.026
You go.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.367
(rasping, wheezing)

18:38.408 --> 18:40.202
HARRY:
It was you.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.287
In the ledger.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.706
Dexter B. Vaughn.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.959
You need to go.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.797
Before she realizes you still

18:51.839 --> 18:53.632
have a life force
and tries to take it.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.096
I can handle myself in the Veil.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.267
But what are you doing here?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.186
You should know
better than anyone.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.356
When you devote your life
to powerful, magical women...

19:10.566 --> 19:12.901
that business is
never quite finished.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.903
Thank you, by the way.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.157
For loving my daughter.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.825
Both of them, really.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.162
It was the honor of my life.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.164
(screeches)

19:31.461 --> 19:35.007
Which brings me to why I'm here.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.467
I need to know why you bought
the Unity Bowl.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.470
'Cause it was my last shot
at happiness.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.933
When both halves are assembled,

19:44.975 --> 19:47.728
the Bowl can undo any curse.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.356
Oh, you were trying to break
the Necromancer's curse

19:51.398 --> 19:53.108
so you could be with Marisol.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.235
And both of my daughters.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.321
Yeah.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.448
But fate had other plans.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.202
Harry.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.245
(screeches)

20:07.331 --> 20:08.832
(short chuckle)

20:08.874 --> 20:11.627
You don't remember my birthday?

20:11.668 --> 20:13.545
I remember.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.049
Okay, uh, what is it?

20:17.090 --> 20:18.759
November 3rd.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.304
November 4th?
Mm-mmm.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.431
17th?
16th.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.975
Damn it.
It's cool, I'm just...

20:27.017 --> 20:29.061
surprised.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.146
You made such
a big to-do about it,

20:31.188 --> 20:33.774
with dinner and presents.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.693
You meant a lot.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.570
Even when I was too distracted

20:38.612 --> 20:39.988
or busy to show it.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.615
Well...

20:41.657 --> 20:43.533
it meant a lot to me, too.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.954
Even if I was
too proud to say it.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.248
Rubes, I'm...
It's fine.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.083
It's...

20:51.124 --> 20:53.460
fine, uh...

20:53.502 --> 20:56.797
birthday, November 16th...

20:56.838 --> 20:58.715
1995.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.177
(sighs)

21:02.219 --> 21:04.805
Let's just hope
I live to see another one.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.848
We're gonna get
through this.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.976
I promise.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.563
Okay. Uh...

21:13.605 --> 21:15.941
that's a doll for everyone
the Unseen are hunting.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.068
Except Kaela's
birth parents.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.154
But it looks like
we're almost out of lavender.

21:21.196 --> 21:23.573
Oh, I think
there's some upstairs.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.701
(door creaks)

21:28.287 --> 21:30.205
Okay, now I need you to tell me

21:30.247 --> 21:32.165
where Ruby is.
MAN:
I really don't know.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.084
I know...
What is it?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.585
He's here.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.212
EARL:
I'm not messing around here.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.672
Just tell me.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.299
Tell me.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.009
Tell me...

21:42.050 --> 21:44.011
where Ruby is.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.804
I don't think he saw you.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.764
Let's just go back
to the command center.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.726
Tell me!
I'm sorry...

21:53.854 --> 21:55.772
Hiya, sunshine.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.608
Grab my arm.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.660
(indistinct chatter)

22:08.702 --> 22:09.953
Where are we?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.288
The Blue Camellia.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.081
It's kind of like
a magical...

22:14.082 --> 22:16.126
What the hell is she doing here?

22:17.085 --> 22:18.628
...safe haven.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.965
How dare she come in here
as if nothing happened?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.967
RUBY:
You sure? 'Cause, uh, there's

22:24.009 --> 22:25.927
a lot of angry faces
looking this way.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.764
I may or may not have
had a hot girl summer

22:28.805 --> 22:30.766
and ghosted a few
magical ladies.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.642
Ignore them.
WOMAN: Want a beer? (grunts)

22:32.684 --> 22:34.561
Damn, girl.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.105
How many magical ladies
did you ghost?

22:39.274 --> 22:41.276
We're running out
of time, Harry.
I'll go

22:41.318 --> 22:43.737
after you tell me what you know
about the Unity Bowl.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.740
Anything that could help save

22:46.782 --> 22:49.326
Ray.
Ray Vera?

22:50.702 --> 22:53.288
I know you two probably didn't
have the best relationship.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.539
That's putting it mildly.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.792
Well, he's dying.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.462
And that Bowl might be
able to save his life.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.970
Maggie already
lost her sister.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.016
Don't let her lose
her father, too.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.978
Please.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.778
When I was looking for the Bowl,
I heard a story.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.906
That thousands of years ago,
the original nine clans

23:27.948 --> 23:30.575
of magic came together
to fight an ancient enemy.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.286
Each creature poured
its powers into

23:33.328 --> 23:35.163
the Unity Bowl
to forge some kind

23:35.205 --> 23:38.208
of ultimate power that
the world had never seen before.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.044
How have I never
heard about this?

23:43.755 --> 23:45.215
Look out!

23:53.557 --> 23:56.893
Get down!
WOMAN: The Charmed Ones
can't be trusted!

23:56.935 --> 23:58.812
WOMAN 2: You're wrong!
They're peacekeepers!

23:58.854 --> 24:01.273
Something tells me this isn't
about you ghosting ladies.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.317
It's the Unseen
and their propaganda.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.695
People are starting
to lose it.
Enough!

24:06.736 --> 24:09.573
Time to smoke y'all out!

24:15.370 --> 24:17.080
Roxy, I am so...
No.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.166
Nope, no.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.293
You don't get
to apologize for this.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.420
You know, I never even
needed a failsafe button

24:23.462 --> 24:25.005
under the bar
till you started coming here,

24:25.046 --> 24:28.300
riling people up, drawing
in terrorist hobgoblins.

24:28.341 --> 24:31.219
It is not my fault that the
magical world is falling apart.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.305
Well, it's not not your fault.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.432
And you, Curly Sue--

24:35.474 --> 24:37.726
find yourself
a new girlfriend.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.769
Kiss-N-Tell-Mel is
nothing but trouble.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.481
Okay, the name's Ruby.
And we're not...

24:43.857 --> 24:45.984
I mean-I mean,
we're just...

24:47.903 --> 24:50.280
Not anymore.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.408
The Unseen doxxed
everyone that I care about.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.285
Now a demon from her past
is after her.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.287
(laughs)

24:57.329 --> 24:58.705
Like I said.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.832
Trouble.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.792
Fine.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.086
But I am just trying
to protect Ruby.

25:05.128 --> 25:08.131
So can we please stay here
while I figure out what to do?

25:12.552 --> 25:13.887
Grab a mop.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.722
What?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.517
This place won't clean itself.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.105
I'm sorry
I dragged you into this.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.565
It's not your fault.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.817
It is.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.861
The only reason you have
a target on your back

25:29.903 --> 25:31.488
is because you and I
were together.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.532
Mel, I've running for six years

25:33.573 --> 25:35.825
because my stepdad is a psycho.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.452
Not because of you.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.038
I'm just happy that Swan's

25:40.080 --> 25:41.706
out of town for all this.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.589
Roxie's right.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.050
The whole magical world's
a mess,

25:52.092 --> 25:53.969
and so am I.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.637
What's worse is that I have

25:55.679 --> 25:58.473
no idea how to fix any of it.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.185
Mel, look at me.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.564
Nothing's broken
that can't be fixed.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.399
Not this bar.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.695
Not the magical world.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.155
Not Ray.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.657
Hell, even the Iron Maiden

26:15.699 --> 26:17.409
will come around eventually.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.160
Roxie?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.372
I mean, she cute
when she mad, but damn

26:22.414 --> 26:25.166
if she ain't scary.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.668
You know, she can
hear everything

26:26.710 --> 26:28.295
that happens down here.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.879
Good.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.007
Then let her hear this.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.219
Even if we're not
a thing anymore,

26:36.261 --> 26:39.306
I will always have your back.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.726
And I'll always have yours.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.811
What do you say we take

26:44.853 --> 26:46.605
the fight
to this demon together?

26:46.646 --> 26:49.107
I thought you wanted
to wait for Mags and Kaela.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.443
We are two badass women.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.695
We can handle this ourselves.

26:56.197 --> 26:59.159
ROXIE:
Make that three badass women.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.495
What?

27:02.537 --> 27:04.831
The Iron Maiden wants
in on this action.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.967
(muffled):
You all right, sweetie?

27:16.926 --> 27:18.678
Huh?

27:18.720 --> 27:20.805
I said are
you all right?

27:20.847 --> 27:22.807
You seem
a bit out of it.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.893
Oh, um...

27:24.934 --> 27:27.103
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm...

27:27.145 --> 27:28.647
I'm fine.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.231
Sorry.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.524
Want some sweet tea
while you wait

27:31.566 --> 27:33.568
for your friend
to call a mechanic?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.153
Oh, sure.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.488
That'd be great.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.615
Thanks.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.287
Are you an artist?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.456
Uh, that would be me.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.583
Um, sculptures, mostly.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.794
But, um...

27:50.835 --> 27:52.879
I do a bit of everything.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.465
(chuckles softly)

27:55.507 --> 27:57.050
What about you?

27:57.092 --> 27:59.469
Wildlife ecologist.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.596
That's so cool.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.103
Um...

28:08.144 --> 28:10.188
Right. Well...

28:10.230 --> 28:12.941
it was so lovely
to meet you both.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.443
We better be going.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.821
MAGGIE:
Isn't there something you
want to ask them first?

28:18.988 --> 28:20.699
KAELA:
Uh, I can't.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.332
Thank you for the tea.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.959
Okay.
Yeah.

28:32.335 --> 28:34.379
(Zephyr grunting)

28:37.674 --> 28:39.843
(chuckles)

28:39.884 --> 28:41.094
Sorry.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.097
I had some gum earlier.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.225
She's always chewing gum.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.601
Thank you.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.480
Well, uh, good luck
with that car.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.900
(thump)
(glass breaks)

28:55.942 --> 28:58.027
(Kaela gasps)

28:58.069 --> 29:00.196
What the hell just happened?

29:00.238 --> 29:02.449
Oh, God.
What?

29:03.658 --> 29:05.660
Kaela, your bio-parents
aren't magical at all.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.872
If my frog toxin
did that to them,

29:08.913 --> 29:11.082
they're human.

29:18.214 --> 29:20.592
ROXIE:
So, he's what?

29:20.633 --> 29:23.470
Run-of-the-mill demon-- big,
beefy, dumb as a box of rocks?

29:23.511 --> 29:25.680
Pretty much.
Only this one can duplicate.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.599
MEL:
Then we'll just have
to vanquish his ass

29:27.640 --> 29:30.018
the second he smokes in, before
he gets the chance to double.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.770
But if he does manage
to make a clone,

29:31.811 --> 29:33.229
I'll be ready.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.481
Duncan's probably
found him at SafeSpace

29:34.522 --> 29:36.274
by now
and given him a matchbook.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.651
We need to hurry.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.740
I owe you one, Rox.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.242
You owe me a lot more than that.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.662
Well, I'm sorry

29:49.704 --> 29:52.040
for any chaos I've caused,

29:52.081 --> 29:54.083
intentional or not.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.085
Mel...

29:56.127 --> 29:58.213
I'm a Circadian.

29:58.254 --> 30:01.466
This isn't my first
magical propaganda war.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.679
(soft whooshing)

30:06.721 --> 30:08.223
RUBY:
You guys?

30:08.264 --> 30:10.350
Showtime.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.105
There's my sunshine.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.899
MEL:
Ugh. Just die already.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.151
(grunts)

30:22.403 --> 30:24.030
Another clone?

30:24.072 --> 30:26.366
(shouts)

30:27.659 --> 30:29.619
That wasn't so bad.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.912
(laughs)

30:34.332 --> 30:36.209
You only said he could double.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.627
He upgraded?

30:37.669 --> 30:38.962
MEL:
We need to regroup.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.338
Just run.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.386
This doesn't make any sense.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.971
I'm a Charmed One.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.597
How are my parents just basic,

30:49.639 --> 30:51.599
sweet-tea-drinking humans?
I don't know.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.101
But if it weren't
for my toxic

30:53.142 --> 30:54.477
hand, at least they'd
still be breathing.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.855
Maggie, this-this isn't
your fault.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.481
It is my fault.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.441
This power should have
gone away hours ago.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.360
Kind of seems like
you're holding onto something

31:02.402 --> 31:04.654
instead of
getting it off your chest.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.825
How are you the one
therapizing me right now?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.452
Because it's okay
not to be okay, remember?

31:12.620 --> 31:14.581
Listen, no matter what

31:14.622 --> 31:17.000
any of this means,
you and I are still sisters,

31:17.041 --> 31:19.294
even if we're technically not.

31:19.335 --> 31:20.753
(chuckles)

31:22.171 --> 31:24.507
Now let's finish up
that antidote and save them.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.261
EARL:
Oh, come on, sunshine.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.723
This is no way to treat
someone who loves you.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.474
Okay.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.476
There are only
three out there, but

31:35.518 --> 31:37.937
how do we tell the clone
from the real one?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.856
Earl's demon eyes don't lie.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.066
Only the real Earl's flash red.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.944
But the last time I saw him,
he could barely keep

31:44.986 --> 31:46.696
one clone going, and he

31:46.738 --> 31:48.656
couldn't clone a matchbook.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.325
I don't know how he did that.

31:50.366 --> 31:52.577
Obsession is a hell
of a motivator to level up.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.913
Then let's use
that obsession against him.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.500
Is that...

31:59.542 --> 32:01.502
Nightingale potion.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.087
It allows us borrow your voice

32:03.129 --> 32:04.714
to divide and conquer.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.383
You gonna tell her or should I?

32:10.970 --> 32:14.015
To activate the potion
we need to...

32:15.224 --> 32:16.476
...kiss you.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.983
Oh.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.526
Oh, okay.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.278
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I can handle that

32:27.320 --> 32:28.905
if-if y'all can.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.618
(soft chuckle)

32:33.660 --> 32:35.703
Not bad, Curly Sue.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.832
Okay.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.094
Well?

32:52.261 --> 32:54.514
(Ruby's voice):
Please don't tell Swan
that I did that.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.059
Just a few drops should do it.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.439
Are they gonna remember this?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.817
No.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.653
The nader flowers I added
will wipe their memories.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.655
Okay.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.992
I'm gonna wait outside.
Okay.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.497
(both groan)

33:24.002 --> 33:25.962
Hey, you okay?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.588
What happened?

33:27.630 --> 33:30.049
There was a gas leak

33:30.091 --> 33:32.010
and you passed out.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.554
And who are you?

33:34.595 --> 33:37.890
