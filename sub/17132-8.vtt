WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:05.106
MAHALO, GEORGE.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.108
I WENT SHOPPING FOR OUR TRIP
TO HAWAII TODAY,

00:07.108 --> 00:08.976
AND I GOT
SOME GREAT STUFF.

00:08.976 --> 00:13.781
CHECK OUT
MY NEW BATHING SUIT.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.284
MA-HELLO.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.389
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT YOU GUYS
ARE GOING TO HAWAII WITHOUT ME.

00:21.389 --> 00:24.058
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAX--
IF YOU CAN SPELL "MAUI,"

00:24.058 --> 00:27.328
YOU CAN COME WITH US.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.534
M-O-W-I-E.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.136
ANGIE?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.338
NO.
SORRY, DUDE, WAY OFF.

00:41.275 --> 00:45.646
MAX, THIS TRIP
ISN'T A FAMILY VACATION.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.915
YOUR FATHER AND I NEED
SOME ALONE TIME

00:47.915 --> 00:51.919
TO RENEW OUR RELATIONSHIP
AND RECONNECT EMOTIONALLY.

00:51.919 --> 00:55.256
LOOK WHAT YOU DID
TO OUR MARRIAGE.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.858
YOUR MOM AND I HAVE TO FLY
THOUSANDS OF MILES

00:57.858 --> 01:01.562
TO SOME ISLAND JUST TO REMEMBER
WHAT WE SAW IN EACH OTHER.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.799
YEAH, THANKS A LOT,
HOME WRECKER.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.670
NOW I HAVE TO RESERVE
THE RENTAL CAR.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.773
WHAT CREDIT CARD DID YOU USE
TO BOOK THE HOTEL?

01:12.773 --> 01:16.009
I DIDN'T USE A CREDIT CARD.
I JUST MADE THE RESERVATION.

01:16.009 --> 01:19.180
WHAT?! I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN,

01:19.180 --> 01:21.949
OR THEY DON'T HOLD THE ROOM.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.884
WHA... AH-HAH!

01:23.884 --> 01:25.853
I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.757
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR FACE--
YOU WERE LIKE THAT...

01:29.757 --> 01:31.992
I USED THE GOLD CARD.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.728
DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.
YOU SCARED ME.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.064
ANGIE, THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST VACATION EVER.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.934
GET READY, 'CAUSE EVERY NIGHT--
WATCH OUT. (whistles)

01:40.934 --> 01:42.703
ALOHA,MY LOVE.
GO GET READY,

01:42.703 --> 01:45.606
'CAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
I CAN FEEL IT RIGHT NOW.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.576
OH, PLEASE,
OH, PLEASE, OH, PLEASE.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.712
ONE TIME, ONE TIME,
ONE TIME, ONE TIME.

01:51.712 --> 01:55.015
YEAH, YEAH,
ALOHATO YOU, TOO.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.817
HEY, THIS IS GEORGE LOPEZ.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.819
I, UH, BOOKED A ROOM
FOR SATURDAY,

01:58.819 --> 02:02.690
BUT I FORGOT TO CALL IN
AND HOLD IT WITH MY CREDIT CARD.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.559
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU GAVE IT AWAY?!

02:05.559 --> 02:08.862
IS THAT BECAUSE
I'MCHICANO,OR WHAT?

02:08.862 --> 02:12.433
I'M NOT CALLING YOU A RACIST,
MR. GONZALEZ.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.701
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU BACK,
BROTHER.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.370
VIVA LA RAZA.
SÃ­, SE PUEDE.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.675
WHO WAS THAT?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.511
OH, JUST DOUBLE-CHECKING
WITH THE HOTEL.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.513
OOH, WHAT'S
THE CONFIRMATION NUMBER?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.948
I WANNA WRITE IT DOWN,
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS FORGET IT.

02:27.948 --> 02:32.786
OKAY, UH, GET READY.
"C" AS IN CHARLES, 3-P-O,

02:32.786 --> 02:37.425
DASH "R"... UH, 2-D-2.

02:41.028 --> 02:44.031
HONEY... COME SIT DOWN.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.467
WHAT IS IT?

02:46.467 --> 02:48.236
I HAVE SOME HORRIBLE NEWS.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.671
DADDY, WHAT'S WRONG?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.341
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM YOUR SISTER.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.876
UH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS,

02:55.876 --> 02:59.347
BUT YOUR MOTHER
PASSED AWAY THIS AFTERNOON.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.818
WHAT?NO!

03:04.818 --> 03:06.887
SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.925
OH, ANGIE, I'M SO SORRY.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.428
I HAVE TO CALL MY SISTER.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.597
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
YOU KNOW, THIS IS CRAP!

03:18.599 --> 03:20.668
WHY CAN'T I GO TO HAWAII
WITH YOU?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.570
I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.572
MAX, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HAWAII ANYMORE.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.975
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED.
OH, I GET IT. YOU DON'T
WANNA HEAR ME COMPLAIN,

03:27.975 --> 03:30.978
SO YOU SAY THE TRIP'S OFF,
AND THEN YOU JUST SNEAK OUT.

03:30.978 --> 03:35.983
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT YOUR
GRANDMA EMELINA, UH, DIED TODAY.

03:35.983 --> 03:39.152
NICE TRY. DOES MOM KNOW
THAT'S THE ONE YOU'RE USING?

03:39.152 --> 03:40.754
BECAUSE THAT'S SICK!

03:40.754 --> 03:42.790
NO, MAN, IT'S TRUE.
SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.158
REALLY?
WHAT IF I CALL HER?

03:45.158 --> 03:46.660
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:46.660 --> 03:51.031
CALL HER, AND IF SHE PICKS UP,
I WANNA TALK TO HER.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.967
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

03:57.204 --> 04:00.341
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:00.341 --> 04:03.644
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:03.644 --> 04:06.614
**

04:13.186 --> 04:15.188
I GOT YOU SOME TEA, ANGIE.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.990
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?

04:16.990 --> 04:21.228
NO. I KEPT WAKING UP
AND THINKING IT WAS A DREAM.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.731
IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.133
I JUST TALKED TO MY MOM
LAST WEEK.

04:26.133 --> 04:30.438
YEAH, I'LL NEVER FORGET ALL
THE STUFF GRANDMA DID FOR ME.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.773
SHE HELPED ME
THROUGH REHAB...

04:32.773 --> 04:36.009
SHE BAILED ME OUT WHEN
I GOT CAUGHT SHOPLIFTING...

04:36.009 --> 04:38.546
SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES

04:38.546 --> 04:42.350
WHEN I STOLE HER CAR
AND CRASHED IT.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.387
YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF YOU.

04:46.387 --> 04:51.058
SHE KEPT YOUR MUG SHOT
IN HER WALLET.

04:51.058 --> 04:56.730
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M NEVER
GONNA TALK TO HER AGAIN.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.899
UH... I MEAN,
CAN I DO ANYTHING, ANGIE?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.402
CAN I GET YOU SOME HONEY
FOR YOUR TEA?

05:01.402 --> 05:05.873
MY MOM USED TO PUT HONEY
IN MY TEA.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.375
OKAY, NO HONEY.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.377
UH... CAN I TURN ON THE TV?

05:09.377 --> 05:12.346
MAYBE IT'LL TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF THINGS, HUH?

05:14.114 --> 05:17.851
DAMN, HOW CAN THESE BATTERIES
BE DEAD? THEY WENT SO QUICK!

05:23.223 --> 05:28.028
BUT... YOU KNOW, THEY HAD
A LONG AND FRUITFUL LIFE...

05:28.028 --> 05:29.329
JUST GO.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.499
OKAY, THANK YOU.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.069
ARE VERONICA AND MOM
CRYING AGAIN?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.871
YEAH. HEY, UH...

05:37.871 --> 05:41.842
DON'T MENTION
BATTERIES OR HONEY.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.446
I KINDA FEEL BAD
THAT I HAVEN'T CRIED.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.280
I MEAN, THAT'S OKAY,
YOU KNOW?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.718
MEN AREN'T SUPPOSED TO CRY, MAX.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE STRONG.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.053
YOU CRIED
DURING THAT PENGUIN MOVIE.

05:53.053 --> 05:58.459
THE EGG SLIPPED
ONTO THE ICE AND FROZE.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.596
I JUST FEEL BAD
THAT I DON'T FEEL BAD.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.132
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
MAX. I MEAN, LOOK,

06:05.132 --> 06:07.701
YOU REALLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR GRANDMA THAT WELL.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.604
YOU ONLY SAW HER AT HOLIDAYS.
YOU NEVER LIKED HER, DID YOU?

06:10.604 --> 06:13.106
MAX, DON'T SAY THAT.
LOOK, WHEN SOMEONE PASSES AWAY,

06:13.106 --> 06:15.509
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO SAY
GOOD THINGS ABOUT THEM.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.278
WHAT GOOD STUFF
CAN YOU SAY ABOUT GRANDMA?

06:18.278 --> 06:22.315
OKAY, UM...

06:22.315 --> 06:24.485
WHEN I MARRIED YOUR MOM...

06:24.485 --> 06:27.655
EMELINA WAS SO MAD AT ME THAT
SHE THREW A GLASS OF WINE AT ME,

06:27.655 --> 06:29.657
AND SHE HIT ME IN THE HEAD.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.859
SO AT THE SERVICE,
I'M GONNA TELL PEOPLE THAT,

06:31.859 --> 06:36.129
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
SHE HAD A HELL OF AN ARM.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.804
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP, VIC?
OH, NOT SO GOOD.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.807
EMELINA AND I WERE JUST ABOUT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

06:46.807 --> 06:50.410
AND THEN... SHE'S GONE.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.979
HERE IT COMES.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.881
NO, NO, DON'T YOU DO IT, VIC,
DON'T YOU DO IT.

06:53.881 --> 06:59.386
MAN UP. AHEM, AHEM, AHEM.

06:59.386 --> 07:04.091
OH... MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.394
HI, DADDY.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.829
ANGIE, DARLING.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.132
I JUST READ THROUGH
YOUR MOTHER'S WILL,

07:12.132 --> 07:15.368
AND SHE WANTS YOU TO TAKE CARE
OF HER BURIAL ARRANGEMENTS.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.237
WHY ME?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.372
WELL, YOU ARE
THE MOST RESPONSIBLE CHILD.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.610
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
ASKED ME TO HANDLE THINGS

07:22.610 --> 07:24.612
IF WE'D HAD
A CHANCE TO RECONCILE,

07:24.612 --> 07:28.081
BUT FATE DECIDED
IT WAS NOT TO BE.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.917
HERE IT COMES.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.487
DON'T DO IT, VIC.
AHEM, AHEM...

07:33.487 --> 07:37.190
HI, ANGIE.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.425
SORRY ABOUT EMELINA.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.427
I BROUGHT OVER SOME FOOD.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.229
THANK YOU, BENNY.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.236
(mouths words)

07:51.471 --> 07:53.240
(mouths words)

08:10.290 --> 08:11.825
OH!

08:15.563 --> 08:17.364
GEORGE...

08:17.364 --> 08:18.932
I'VE DECIDED,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.602
IF I'M IN CHARGE OF
MY MOM'S BURIAL ARRANGEMENTS,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.904
I WANT HER OUT HERE.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.972
OF COURSE.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.407
WE HAVE THREE SPACES
IN OUR FAMILY PLOT.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.677
I WANT HER NEXT TO ME.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.613
OH, UM... YOU KNOW, I...
WE CAN'T DO THAT, ANGIE.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.315
YOU KNOW, THOSE SPOTS
ARE FOR, UH, YOU KNOW,

08:35.315 --> 08:37.384
ME, YOU AND MY MOTHER.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.687
BENNY...

08:39.687 --> 08:41.321
I FEEL WEIRD ASKING THIS--

08:41.321 --> 08:45.025
NO, ANGIE.
WE MADE A PROMISE TO MY MOM.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.795
THAT'S HER SPOT. SHE WANTS TO BE
RIGHT NEXT TO ME, RIGHT, MOM?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.963
YOU CAN HAVE IT
FOR 50 BUCKS.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.367
THANK YOU, BENNY.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.571
I PROMISE WE WILL FIND
A GREAT SPOT FOR YOU,

08:57.571 --> 08:59.940
AND--AND YOU, TOO, DADDY.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.942
OH,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.944
WHEN I GO,
MY DEATH WILL GIVE LIFE.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.180
I'M DONATING MY BODY
TO SCIENCE.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.019
WELL, I FEEL SORRY
FOR WHOEVER GETS YOUR TONGUE.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.257
(imitating Vic)
"IF THE SURGERY WAS A SUCCESS,

09:17.257 --> 09:20.928
WHY AM I TALKING
WITH THIS RIDICULOUS ACCENT?"

09:22.930 --> 09:25.733
WE'LL HAVE TO FLY MAMI
OUT HERE.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.602
I HAVE THE NUMBER
FOR THE FUNERAL HOME.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.305
I HAVE
TO GET TO THE CEMETERY.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.808
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN BURY
EMELINA NEXT TO US.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.477
WHY? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
MOM, I ONLY GOT TWO SPOTS.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.312
I GOTTA GET
THE SPOT NEXT TO US,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.314
OR I'M GONNA
BREAK ANGIE'S HEART.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

09:41.314 --> 09:45.152
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO
WITH ME WHEN I DIE?
PET CEMETERY.

09:47.254 --> 09:51.024
I ALREADY GOT
YOUR LITTLE CASKET.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.661
YOUR PAWS ARE GONNA BE
LIKE THIS.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.296
I TOLD 'EM YOU WERE
A MEXI-DOODLE. (squeals)

10:02.069 --> 10:04.237
HELLO.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.439
I'M MARY BASS,
THE SALES MANAGER.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.408
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.244
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I BOUGHT TWO GRAVE SITES,

10:11.244 --> 10:13.546
AND NOW I NEED ONE MORE
RIGHT BESIDE THEM.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.548
THE NAME IS GEORGE LOPEZ.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.918
WELL, LET'S SEE.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.955
HMM. I'M SORRY. EVERYTHING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU IS TAKEN.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.557
THE BEST I CAN DO IS, UH...
TWO PLOTS AWAY.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.960
MAYBE YOU CAN CALL THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN BETWEEN US,

10:26.960 --> 10:30.698
AND SEE IF THEY'D BE WILLING
TO, YOU KNOW, LIKE, SCOOT DOWN?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.165
I'M SORRY.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.567
MR. AND MRS. TARKESIAN
HAVE ALREADY BEEN BURIED.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.970
THEIR SCOOTING DAYS
ARE OVER.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.840
OKAY, I KNOW YOU CAN'T BE
INVOLVED IN THIS

10:39.840 --> 10:41.241
BECAUSE OF RAMIFICATIONS,

10:41.241 --> 10:43.744
BUT WHAT IF MY BUDDY AND I
CAME BACK TONIGHT

10:43.744 --> 10:47.981
WITH A BACKHOE
AND REPLANTED THEM?

10:47.981 --> 10:52.485
WE'RE LATINOS. IT'LL LOOK LIKE
WE'RE WORKING OVERTIME.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.855
MR. LOPEZ, THAT'S ILLEGAL.

10:54.855 --> 10:58.091
THE ONLY TIME WE DISINTER
IS UNDER A COURT ORDER.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.993
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO DO THIS,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.796
BUT I'M AN UNDERCOVER CORONER,
AND I SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.531
DIG 'EM UP, LADY!

11:04.531 --> 11:09.803
DIG 'EM UP!
DIG 'EM... UP.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.973
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MORE CONVINCING

11:12.973 --> 11:15.675
IF YOUR FRIEND
WASN'T SMILING.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.045
HEY, I'M ONLY SMILING

11:18.045 --> 11:23.350
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE MY JOB
AS ASSISTANT UNDERCOVER CORONER.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.256
OKAY, LOOK,
MY WIFE'S MOM JUST DIED,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.258
AND SHE WANTS HER BURIED
NEXT TO US.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.827
AND I SCREWED UP
AND ONLY GOT TWO PLOTS,

11:33.827 --> 11:35.796
BUT NOW I NEED THREE TOGETHER,
ALL RIGHT?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.697
I'LL PAY WHATEVER IT COSTS.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.267
OH. AHEM. JUST A MOMENT.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.703
YOU'RE IN LUCK.

11:43.703 --> 11:48.008
I HAVE THREE SPACES
RIGHT HERE,

11:48.008 --> 11:50.343
AND IT'LL JUST COST YOU
FOR THE ONE ADDITIONAL SPOT.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.312
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.947
$15,000.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.682
15 GRAND? NO WAY!

11:55.682 --> 11:58.018
WELL, I'M SORRY. IT'S
THE ONLY THREE I HAVE TOGETHER.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.020
IF IT WERE MY FAMILY,

12:00.020 --> 12:03.256
I WOULDN'T HESITATE
TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.259
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO GO
TO MY WIFE AND TELL HER

12:06.259 --> 12:11.164
SHE CAN'T SPEND THE REST
OF ETERNITY NEXT TO HER MOM.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.334
YOU'RE TRYING TO GUILT ME.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.236
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.872
I'M A LOPEZ.
WE'RE BORN EMOTIONALLY DETACHED.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.874
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE LIVING.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.044
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA
SPEND MONEY ON THE DEAD?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.046
WE LET THE CITY
TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.581
"CAN YOU IDENTIFY THIS BODY,
SIR?"

12:28.581 --> 12:30.083
"NO, I CAN'T."

12:30.083 --> 12:33.086
"BYE, UNCLE BOBBY."

12:33.086 --> 12:36.023
Ã³RALE, QUINCY, LET'S GO.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.696
HEY.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.032
HEY.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.667
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOM, ANGIE.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.670
THANK YOU, ERNIE.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.105
YOU DOING OKAY, BABY?

12:52.105 --> 12:55.175
WELL, I WAS TRYING TO
PUT TOGETHER PHOTOS OF MY MOM

12:55.175 --> 12:58.178
FOR THE VIEWING, BUT I JUST
CAN'T LOOK AT THEM RIGHT NOW.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.213
I THINK I'LL, UH,
DROP BY THE CEMETERY

13:00.213 --> 13:02.715
TO SEE WHICH PLOT
I WANT TO GIVE HER.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.186
UH, OH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA WATCH SOME TV.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.188
YEAH, THERE'S A SPECIAL ON

13:08.188 --> 13:10.390
ABOUT THE WORLD'S
MOST HORRIBLE HUSBANDS.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.292
YEAH.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.261
THEY CHEAT,
AND THEY'RE ABUSIVE.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.831
IT KINDA MAKES A LITTLE LIE
SEEM LIKE NOTHING, HUH?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.874
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

13:26.874 --> 13:29.709
UH... OKAY, ANGIE,
YOU'RE HURTING,

13:29.709 --> 13:31.578
SO I'M JUST
GONNA TELL THE TRUTH.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.547
THE OWNERS OF THE CEMETERY
WERE IN DEBT,

13:34.547 --> 13:38.251
AND THEY HAD TO SELL SOME LAND
BACK TO THE CITY.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.087
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, UM...

13:40.087 --> 13:42.089
THAT OUR PLOTS
ARE NOW GONNA BE

13:42.089 --> 13:45.325
UNDER A SWIMMING POOL
FOR DEAF KIDS.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.896
WHAT? THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.330
ANGIE, THEY NEED
THEIR OWN POOLS

13:50.330 --> 13:53.033
BECAUSE THEIR MARCO POLO GAMES
TAKE FOREVER.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.403
THEY'RE LIKE THIS--
"MARCO"...

14:02.109 --> 14:07.114
YOU NEVER BOUGHT
THREE PLOTS, DID YOU?

14:07.114 --> 14:09.016
ANGIE, LET ME EXPLAIN--
DID YOU?

14:09.016 --> 14:11.318
NO. I FORGOT TO BUY
THE THIRD PLOT.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.987
WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PUT MY MOTHER?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.788
ANGIE, LISTEN,
I WENT TO THE CEMETERY,

14:15.788 --> 14:18.491
AND THE CLOSEST SPOT THEY HAD
WAS TWO PEOPLE DOWN.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.193
THAT'S NOT NEXT TO ME.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.230
BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAR.
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE

14:23.230 --> 14:25.232
FROM THE OVEN TO THE TABLE.

14:25.232 --> 14:29.302
JUST IMAGINE A NICE,
DEAD ARMENIAN COUPLE, ANGIE,

14:29.302 --> 14:31.738
RIGHT THERE
WHERE THE SINK IS.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.841
NO. YOU RUINED THIS.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.911
I SAID I WANTED HER
NEXT TO ME.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.153
WOW, SHE SEEMED REALLY MAD.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.720
OH, I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
THIS UPSET.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.358
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
BOTHERING HER ABOUT HER MOM.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.227
NO, LOOK, I KNOW ANGIE, MAN.
I REALLY SCREWED UP THIS TIME.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.229
THIS ONE'S ABOUT ME.
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.531
A LOT OF TIMES
WHEN SOMEONE DIES SUDDENLY,

14:58.531 --> 15:01.234
ALL THE PEOPLE
CLOSE TO THEM ARE LEFT

15:01.234 --> 15:04.304
HOLDING A BAG
OF UNEXPRESSED EMOTIONS.

15:07.174 --> 15:10.777
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:10.777 --> 15:12.312
ALL RIGHT, CHECK IT OUT.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.281
WHEN MY AUNTCUCADIED,
MY MOM SEEMED OKAY

15:14.281 --> 15:16.283
UNTIL I ASKED HER
FOR SOME LEMONADE.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.952
THEN SHE STARTED BEATING ME
WITH A WOODEN SPOON.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.921
PALO,PALO,
BUT IT TURNS OUT,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.356
THAT WHEN
THEY WERE LITTLE GIRLS,

15:23.356 --> 15:26.326
THEY HAD A LEMONADE STAND,
AND MY MOM STOLE THE MONEY,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.828
SO WHEN MY AUNT DIED,
MY MOM FELT GUILTY

15:28.828 --> 15:31.331
BECAUSE
SHE NEVER TOLD HER.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.333
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK ANGIE

15:33.333 --> 15:36.803
IF SHE AND HER MOM
EVER HAD A LEMONADE STAND,

15:36.803 --> 15:40.273
OR A PAPER ROUTE OR...

15:40.273 --> 15:42.809
TÃºSABES, ANY OTHER KIND
OF SMALL BUSINESS ENDEAVOR

15:42.809 --> 15:46.246
THAT COULD'VE LED
TO AN UNRESOLVED GRIEVANCE.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.417
WHAT HAPPENED, MAN,
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:50.417 --> 15:53.820
YOU STARTED TALKING,
AND THEN I BLACKED OUT.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.288
"UNEXPRESSED EMOTION"?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.390
ESTÃ¡ LOCO,
"UNEXPRESSED EMOTION"!

16:03.296 --> 16:05.598
ANGIE...
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.634
LOOK, I'LL GO
TO A DIFFERENT CEMETERY

16:07.634 --> 16:09.269
WHERE WE CAN GET
THREE SPOTS TOGETHER.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.138
IT'S TOO LATE.
NO, IT'S NOT.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.140
LOOK, ANGIE, I'LL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.308
I MEAN,
I'LL BORROW THE MONEY,

16:15.308 --> 16:18.511
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET THIS FIXED.
NO. DROP IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.115
IT CAN'T BE FIXED.
IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.618
LOOK, I--

16:25.618 --> 16:27.620
I'M JUST GONNA
GO AHEAD AND ASK.

16:27.620 --> 16:33.093
ANGIE, DID YOU AND YOUR MOM
EVER HAVE A... LEMONADE STAND?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.796
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

16:36.796 --> 16:39.499
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.869
MAYBE YOU GOT A BAG
OF UNEXPRESSED EMOTIONS.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.838
I WISH
THEY WERE UNEXPRESSED.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.940
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.510
WHEN WE WERE
ON THE PHONE LAST WEEK,

16:50.510 --> 16:54.381
I TOLD HER I NEVER FORGAVE HER
FOR CHEATING ON MY DAD.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.884
I CALLED HER A SELFISH TRAMP.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.687
THAT...

17:00.687 --> 17:04.091
IS THE LAST THING
I SAID TO MY MOTHER.

17:04.091 --> 17:07.294
OH, BABY,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
(sobs)

17:07.294 --> 17:10.029
COME ON. LOOK, SHE KNEW
YOU LOVED HER, ANGIE.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
ONE FIGHT
WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
I CAN NEVER SAY I'M SORRY.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.937
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE THIS BETTER

17:17.937 --> 17:19.439
NOW THAT SHE'S GONE.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.278
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT TOUGHER NOW.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.247
GEORGE.
OKAY, LOOK, ANGIE,

17:27.247 --> 17:30.750
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES
CARMEN SAID "I HATE YOU" TO US?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.120
47 TIMES.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.121
YOU COUNTED?

17:34.121 --> 17:36.156
YEAH, IT HURT.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.158
OKAY, OKAY, IT HURT.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.460
BUT DID YOU EVER BELIEVE
FOR ONE MINUTE

17:40.460 --> 17:42.662
THAT--THAT CARMEN
DIDN'T LOVE YOU?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.597
NO.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.733
IT'S THE SAME THING
WITH YOUR MOM.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.137
IT'S ALL IN THAT BOOK SHE SENT
YOU AFTER SHE LEFT YOUR DAD.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.005
I WAS SO MAD AT HER,
I NEVER EVEN OPENED IT.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.174
I DID.

17:57.710 --> 18:02.315
WHY WOULD YOU READ A BOOK CALLED
"SINS OF THE MOTHER"?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.217
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

18:04.217 --> 18:08.821
IT FELL OPEN AFTER I THREW IT
AT THAT SPIDER IN THE BATHROOM.

18:08.821 --> 18:12.091
YOU USED A BOOK MY MOM GAVE ME
TO KILL A SPIDER?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.760
KILL? I WISH.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.263
I JUST GOT TWO OF ITS LEGS,
ANGIE.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.265
IT'S STILL AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE,

18:18.265 --> 18:20.567
TRAINING, GETTING STRONGER.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.704
SHE WROTE SOMETHING
IN THE FRONT FOR YOU.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.943
"I READ THIS AND I CRIED,

18:30.943 --> 18:35.782
"AND THEN I SMILED,
BECAUSE IT MADE ME THINK OF US.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.051
"I KNOW YOU MUST BE
ANGRY WITH ME,

18:39.051 --> 18:43.089
"BUT NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

18:43.089 --> 18:46.159
"I'M YOUR MOTHER,

18:46.159 --> 18:50.797
AND I WILL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU."

18:52.799 --> 18:57.136
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SHOWING ME THIS.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.973
YOU FEEL BETTER?

19:00.973 --> 19:04.010
YEAH.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.345
I JUST...

19:05.345 --> 19:07.814
I JUST WISH
THERE WAS SOME WAY

19:07.814 --> 19:11.518
I COULD SHOW HER
HOW MUCH SHE MEANT TO ME.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.687
YOU COULD KEEP
HER MEMORY ALIVE.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.757
YOU KNOW, MAX WAS ASKING ME
ABOUT HER YESTERDAY.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.027
I COULD TELL HIM
ALL ABOUT HER LIFE.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.095
THERE YOU GO.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.665
SO...

19:25.665 --> 19:29.001
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT MY MOM?

19:29.001 --> 19:32.205
WELL, WHY DON'T WE GIVE
OUR SPOTS TO YOUR PARENTS,

19:32.205 --> 19:34.207
AND WHICHEVER
ONE OF US DIES FIRST

19:34.207 --> 19:36.609
GETS TAKEN CARE OF
BY THE OTHER?

19:36.609 --> 19:40.413
YOU'RE GONNA DUMP ME OFF
ON THE CITY, AREN'T YOU?

19:45.552 --> 19:49.289
ANGIE,
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.659
"CAN YOU IDENTIFY THIS BODY,
SIR?"

19:52.659 --> 19:56.829
"I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW HER,
BUT SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.931
BYE, ANGIE."

20:07.374 --> 20:09.342
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

20:09.342 --> 20:11.811
IT'S A SCRAPBOOK
OF OLD PHOTOS OF MY MOM.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.648
I'M LEARNING
ABOUT GRANDMA'S LIFE.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.122
THIS IS GRANDMA EMELINA
IN THE FOURTH GRADE.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.825
HERE SHE IS UNDER A TREE...

20:25.825 --> 20:30.897
THIS IS GREAT. I FEEL LIKE
I REALLY KNOW HER.

20:34.233 --> 20:39.906
ANGIE, DIDN'T YOUR MOM
KEEP A DIARY?

20:39.906 --> 20:45.445
THAT'S RIGHT. SHE WROTE A PAGE
FOR EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE,

20:45.445 --> 20:48.881
STARTING
FROM WHEN SHE WAS 13.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.751
I HAVE IT UPSTAIRS.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.596
THANKS A LOT!
I SAID I FELT BAD.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.766
I DIDN'T SAY I WANTED
TO TAKE "GRANDMA 101."

21:08.100 --> 21:09.902
HEY, IT MAKES
YOUR MOM HAPPY,

21:09.902 --> 21:13.506
AND IT'S A NICE WAY
TO HONOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.709
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M-A GO PLAY GOLF.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.347
I'LL BE BACK IN FIVE HOURS.
YOU SHOULD BE DONE BY THEN.

21:20.347 --> 21:31.624
SEE YA LATER, SUCKER!
GOT YOU!
