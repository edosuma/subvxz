00:01.929 --> 00:03.120
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:07.059
Kate? Pick up.
Find your father, he's in danger.

00:07.929 --> 00:10.070
Oh! Dad, no. Daddy!

00:13.929 --> 00:15.119
Nice plan, Custer.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.010
You can't go in uninvited.
You need us.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.469
It's not what I expected.
Doesn't fit anymore?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.109
- You went too far.
- We're all...

00:31.329 --> 00:34.450
- ...that's between you and darkness.
- You're all fired.

00:34.929 --> 00:38.299
- For God's sake, help us.
- People are going to die.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.850
I just can't seem to care.

01:23.530 --> 01:27.500
What I wouldn't give for
a roving band of Prechian demons now.

01:29.530 --> 01:32.129
Without the ritualistic
slayings, of course.

01:32.530 --> 01:33.969
Of course.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.030
Something to fight. Good to be done.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.469
A little action.

01:46.329 --> 01:48.010
We could buy a star map...

01:48.730 --> 01:51.400
...find out where Steven Seagal lives.

01:52.329 --> 01:55.170
Think he got to be a star
without demonic help?

01:56.530 --> 01:58.459
I say let things be quiet.

01:58.930 --> 02:02.480
Quiet may be good for mankind,
but bad for business.

02:03.129 --> 02:06.540
- We need to make a name for ourselves.
- We can't agree on one.

02:07.329 --> 02:09.008
Unless you came around to--

02:09.128 --> 02:11.159
- Nope.
- Give it up already.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.830
New name or not, we need
to be out plying our trade.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.659
Generating word of mouth.

02:18.129 --> 02:21.009
We can't expect evil
to walk through the door.

02:24.729 --> 02:28.210
- Can we help you?
- I'm looking for Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

02:28.930 --> 02:32.259
- I'm Wesley.
- I'm Francine. My daughter, Stephanie.

02:32.530 --> 02:35.789
- I'm Virginia's friend from the club.
- The country club.

02:36.729 --> 02:39.219
One of Virginia's rich friends?

02:40.330 --> 02:43.099
You certainly came to the right place.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.599
She says you specialize
in the strange.

02:47.530 --> 02:51.009
The stranger the better,
as far as we're concerned.

02:51.729 --> 02:55.310
Tell us the problem. Trust me,
we specialize in strange.

02:55.930 --> 02:58.879
There's nothing we haven't see--

03:01.930 --> 03:04.349
There's an eye in the back
of her head.

03:09.129 --> 03:11.969
Something bit her after swim practice.

03:12.129 --> 03:14.449
When she woke up, that was there.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.030
Did you see who or what
did this to you?

03:19.330 --> 03:23.300
It was dark. She doesn't remember.
She's been in shock since then.

03:24.729 --> 03:27.330
I'll pay whatever it takes.
Can you fix it?

03:27.729 --> 03:31.310
- Consider us already on it.
- You came to the right place.

03:31.930 --> 03:35.789
- Who would do this?
- We'll find out, but it'll take time.

03:36.729 --> 03:40.379
You'd be surprised how many
nasty things are out these days.

03:47.569 --> 03:48.900
He's right behind us.

03:49.370 --> 03:51.439
- Oh, God.
- We gotta move now.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.460
Pass these out,
then get Eva to go into storage.

04:07.969 --> 04:11.270
I bought a lot of sleeping bags
in case we got crowded.

04:20.569 --> 04:23.310
Open up. Please? Open up.

04:24.769 --> 04:28.490
- I know it's past curfew. Let us in.
- 10:00. You know the rules.

04:29.569 --> 04:33.430
I know, but you can't leave us
out here. There's something--

04:33.769 --> 04:35.870
- We gotta come in.
- We're full.

04:36.769 --> 04:40.319
- There's no more beds.
- Please, we'll sleep on the floor.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.389
Anne, don't make us go back out there.

06:18.569 --> 06:22.399
- Hey, Merl.
- Jesus. Can't you, you know, knock?

06:22.769 --> 06:26.139
You don't make that
funny expression when I knock.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.420
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

06:31.170 --> 06:35.029
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yes, I am. As in far, as in now.

06:35.970 --> 06:39.230
Who's gonna tell me all
the fun facts about my friends?

06:39.569 --> 06:42.620
Big meeting tomorrow,
top-level Wolfram & Hart brass.

06:43.769 --> 06:46.680
I think it's a new demon account.
9:30, Diaghilev.

06:46.769 --> 06:51.050
That concludes my career as
an informant. Consider it a freebie.

06:52.170 --> 06:55.120
- Just like everything I've given you.
- 9:30?

06:55.769 --> 06:59.769
Tomorrow. Good luck. Hope you
bust that evil law firm wide open.

07:01.769 --> 07:06.089
- Why the rush to relocate?
- Well, let's see, there's...you.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.959
And every crook and monstro
who thinks they can waltz in...

07:11.370 --> 07:14.209
...and pound me for information.
Without paying.

07:14.970 --> 07:19.180
At least that British guy understood
what a working relationship was.

07:19.769 --> 07:22.680
Had some respect.
You only care about yourself.

07:23.370 --> 07:27.019
- You're in no position to judge--
- How is old Wesley, huh?

07:28.769 --> 07:32.490
Or the other two you fired?
They doing all right?

07:34.170 --> 07:37.500
Gee, let me guess.
You never even bothered to check.

07:39.569 --> 07:42.199
- This had better pan out.
- 9:30, at Diaghilev.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.310
Pleasure doing business with you.

07:52.449 --> 07:55.360
Make sure to get full names.
No tags or nicknames.

07:55.449 --> 07:58.360
I don't want new kids
to slip through the cracks.

07:59.050 --> 08:00.839
- I was getting a vibe.
- Yeah?

08:01.449 --> 08:03.699
- See if she's interested.
- Okay.

08:04.449 --> 08:05.889
- Let me know.
- Kenny.

08:08.649 --> 08:10.790
Can we talk for a sec?

08:15.850 --> 08:17.810
How are you? It's been a while.

08:18.250 --> 08:22.319
Fine. Crashing different places.
You know me and shelters.

08:23.050 --> 08:25.220
Too many rules. I need my freedom.

08:26.649 --> 08:29.839
- So why'd you come in last night?
- It was cold out.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.529
- It was 65 degrees.
- I'm from Florida.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.639
65 degrees is like the Arctic Circle.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.529
Kenny.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.789
Why'd you come in?

08:42.850 --> 08:44.500
- Cops.
- What?

08:45.250 --> 08:49.250
Cops. They've been hassling everybody.
What else is new, right?

08:50.649 --> 08:52.330
But these guys....

08:54.250 --> 08:57.059
- We were hanging down on 39th--
- Panhandling?

08:57.850 --> 08:59.950
No, washing my Mercedes.

09:00.250 --> 09:04.820
This cop comes and hits me so hard,
I thought my teeth were coming out.

09:05.649 --> 09:07.330
He hit you?

09:08.049 --> 09:10.610
- What were you doing?
- Nothing, I swear.

09:11.049 --> 09:13.960
After he punched me,
he threw Les into a wall.

09:14.649 --> 09:17.490
Then he reached
for his nightstick, so we ran.

09:18.250 --> 09:22.250
- He wasn't arresting you or--
- He just said, "No loitering"...

09:22.450 --> 09:26.350
...slugged me in the mouth
and chased us for a couple of blocks.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.620
- We got a big problem.
- Good luck solving it.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.730
I mean, who you gonna call, the cops?

09:38.649 --> 09:40.299
I know someone who can help.

09:44.649 --> 09:45.809
Annie!

09:45.850 --> 09:47.529
What's up, girl?

09:49.450 --> 09:51.840
I ain't seen you in a minute.
Come here.

09:52.450 --> 09:54.029
What brings you here?

09:54.850 --> 09:59.129
I wanted to see how the other half
lives. Oddly, it's not that different.

09:59.649 --> 10:00.980
Come on.

10:02.049 --> 10:05.419
We like to think of it
as Early-American Dilapidation.

10:05.649 --> 10:07.190
- Hi, I'm Cordelia.
- Anne.

10:08.049 --> 10:10.440
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Nice to meet you.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.799
Anne runs a teen shelter on Crenshaw.

10:13.450 --> 10:16.570
- All this time and you still remember.
- I get it.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.610
- I've been busy.
- If you're not too busy...

10:20.649 --> 10:22.679
...can I run something by you?

10:23.049 --> 10:27.159
Kenny's not the only one.
The others all say the same thing.

10:28.450 --> 10:32.070
No provocation. No reason.
The cops are terrorizing them.

10:32.649 --> 10:35.809
Renegade cops. Not exactly my usual.

10:36.850 --> 10:39.519
Oh, that's right. You used to hunt--

10:40.450 --> 10:42.799
- It's cool. They know what's what.
- What?

10:43.450 --> 10:47.240
I still hunt vampires, but I've
learned there are worse things.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.159
Like overzealous cops
beating on my kids.

10:53.049 --> 10:55.789
Speaking of which,
I should really get back.

10:56.649 --> 10:59.070
The shelter gets jammed after sunset.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.750
I'll go with you.
It's not safe to be alone.

11:02.649 --> 11:04.899
I'm going to the center
to see what's up.

11:05.649 --> 11:08.740
And miss out on this exciting case?

11:09.250 --> 11:13.250
- Wesley's friend got bit by a demon.
- Are they okay?

11:14.049 --> 11:17.840
- For the most part.
- But she grew another eye in her head.

11:18.850 --> 11:22.429
That sounds...handy.
What kind of demon does that?

11:23.049 --> 11:27.049
We're trying to figure that out.
Then we'll de-oculate her.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.340
- Just the one in the back.
- Ah, yes.

11:31.450 --> 11:35.029
Angel Investigations, home
of the wicked, high-creep factor.

11:35.649 --> 11:39.230
- Angel?
- Our company, after our former boss.

11:39.850 --> 11:43.259
- We're changing it to the Gunn Agency.
- No, we're not.

11:44.049 --> 11:47.490
- Once these narcissists get some sense.
- But, Angel, that--

11:48.250 --> 11:50.600
Not the guy in the black trench coat?

11:53.049 --> 11:56.629
- You know him?
- He tried to help me out a while ago.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.080
- He did?
- Really?

12:03.850 --> 12:06.759
But it was just a scam
to screw this law firm.

12:08.649 --> 12:11.039
Well, he hasn't changed a bit.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.639
Come on.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.409
- Thanks.
- I got your back.

12:49.090 --> 12:52.000
- I ain't been here in forever.
- It's been a while.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.289
- The cops are tripping, G.
- Define "tripping."

12:58.690 --> 13:00.789
Out for blood. Les got busted up.

13:01.690 --> 13:06.009
The cops stopped me. He got his gun,
looking to put a cap in my ass.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.509
It's outrageous.
They're gonna kill someone.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.259
Could you give us a minute?

13:15.490 --> 13:18.330
I have some paperwork I could do.

13:22.690 --> 13:24.830
- You guys playing her?
- No way.

13:25.690 --> 13:29.379
She's no fool but she has a
blind spot. She wants to trust you.

13:29.889 --> 13:32.350
This ain't no scam. We're the victims.

13:32.889 --> 13:36.889
Right. So, what was you doing
when the cop pulled his piece on you?

13:37.690 --> 13:40.710
- Nothing.
- So I haven't seen you dealing on 5th?

13:41.289 --> 13:44.870
- You telling me it wasn't you?
- It's history. I gave that up.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.279
Do the cops know that?

13:47.889 --> 13:52.460
It's not a street sweep the P.D. does
every six months to shut up the moms.

13:53.289 --> 13:56.309
Okay? This is war.
And everyone's a target.

13:56.889 --> 13:59.419
She speaks true, G. 100% true.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.929
Keep your hands where I can see them.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.850
Sorry, officer.
Have I done something wrong?

14:16.850 --> 14:20.360
Turn around. Face the fence.
Put your hands on your head.

14:21.049 --> 14:22.240
This is a mistake.

14:23.450 --> 14:26.330
- You're under arrest.
- You don't want to do this.

14:27.049 --> 14:29.220
You have the right to remain silent.

14:31.850 --> 14:36.350
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.019
You have the right to an attorney.

14:48.649 --> 14:53.220
Should you be unable to afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.659
Do you understand your rights as I...

15:02.450 --> 15:04.240
...have....

15:22.929 --> 15:26.580
Well, if it isn't Charles Gunn,
brother-at-large.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.549
- Meet Rondell and George.
- Hi.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.200
Greetings. I got the camcorder.
What's up?

15:33.129 --> 15:35.379
A problem I promised we'd check.

15:35.529 --> 15:39.039
- This about cops cracking skulls?
- You know about it?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.870
- Who doesn't?
- I didn't.

15:42.129 --> 15:45.009
- Someone could've told me.
- You weren't around.

15:45.730 --> 15:49.730
You been moving on up, playing
demon detective with the new family.

15:50.529 --> 15:54.669
- "Deluxe apartment in the sky."
- It's Christmas when you call.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.169
Maybe I shouldn't have called.
You're free to go.

15:58.929 --> 16:01.700
- We made the trip.
- Don't do me no favors.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.509
I'm not. The favor's for these kids.

16:07.929 --> 16:10.389
Now, you got a plan or don't you?

16:13.330 --> 16:17.580
It's simple. You roll the camera
and wait for them to hassle us.

16:19.929 --> 16:23.230
- How do you know they will?
- We'll be "walking while black."

16:24.129 --> 16:25.389
Come on.

16:37.769 --> 16:40.860
- Haven't seen you in a while.
- Been busy.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.009
Yeah, me too.

16:52.769 --> 16:57.090
Couple of open cases I'm working.
Two women killed in a clothing store.

16:58.169 --> 17:01.789
Lawyers from Wolfram & Hart
slaughtered in a wine cellar.

17:02.970 --> 17:05.990
- A real tragedy.
- You seem pretty broken up by it.

17:06.569 --> 17:10.190
- We're still looking into this one.
- Good luck with that.

17:12.569 --> 17:16.640
- Didn't find your vampire pals in time.
- I did set them on fire later.

17:17.368 --> 17:21.549
Sounds like you enjoyed it. But
murder's always been up your alley.

17:22.170 --> 17:26.559
I guess this isn't the best time
to tell you I just killed a cop.

17:28.170 --> 17:31.400
I wouldn't joke about that,
even if you are immortal.

17:32.369 --> 17:36.829
Of course, this is a cop that keeps
talking, even after decapitation.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.589
They don't teach that at the academy.

17:40.170 --> 17:42.420
Wanna tell me who it belonged to?

17:52.769 --> 17:54.029
That's him.

17:54.569 --> 17:56.460
- Officer Peter Harkes.
- Know him?

17:56.970 --> 17:59.990
Well enough to be at his funeral
six months ago.

18:01.769 --> 18:03.279
You wanna take a ride?

18:03.569 --> 18:07.710
Yes, we can handle the eye thing
without you. That's not the point.

18:08.970 --> 18:11.849
Just that maybe we should
back you up on this.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.819
Because I don't want you to get hurt.

18:15.569 --> 18:17.640
Of course I do, but--

18:17.970 --> 18:19.160
Hello?

18:22.170 --> 18:25.930
- Gunn's about to do a stupid thing.
- What did he say?

18:26.970 --> 18:31.150
To find out if cops have been
brutalizing and killing people...

18:31.769 --> 18:35.029
...he's gonna tape cops trying
to brutalize and kill him.

18:35.970 --> 18:38.640
- You're joking.
- Nothing says "I'm onto you"...

18:38.970 --> 18:42.900
- ...like getting a police beating.
- You couldn't stop him?

18:43.769 --> 18:46.440
Hello! Gunn, stubborn: synonyms.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.380
That can't be his plan, can it?

18:52.170 --> 18:55.289
I mean, it's really a dumb plan.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.779
Gunn majored in Dumb Planning
from Angel University.

18:59.970 --> 19:04.109
He sat at the feet of the master
and learned well how to plan dumbly.

19:05.369 --> 19:09.440
- We're gonna have to let him do this.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

19:10.170 --> 19:14.670
- He wants help, he knows where we are.
- We'll work our gig, Gunn has his.

19:17.970 --> 19:21.869
- Let's save him from himself.
- The third eye's not going anywhere.

19:34.769 --> 19:36.029
That one.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.980
- He never saw who shot him.
- Catch the killer?

19:40.769 --> 19:43.539
He's no genius.
He's up for the death penalty.

19:44.369 --> 19:45.809
He died six months ago?

19:46.170 --> 19:48.700
- Around then.
- The ground's been disturbed.

19:49.170 --> 19:52.359
- Someone's done some digging.
- How do you know?

19:54.569 --> 19:56.460
A lot of cops buried here?

19:57.569 --> 19:58.410
Yeah.

20:06.569 --> 20:09.380
- How about him?
- Kevin worked Vice.

20:12.569 --> 20:15.690
- What's going on?
- Dead cops are back on the street.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.309
- What? How is that?
- Zombies.

20:19.769 --> 20:24.049
Reanimated corpses that walk and talk.
Somebody else pulls their strings.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.289
Is it--? My dad, is he...?

20:35.970 --> 20:37.549
No.

20:38.369 --> 20:40.230
- Ground's undisturbed.
- You sure?

20:40.769 --> 20:42.589
I'm sure.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.920
You okay?

21:01.170 --> 21:02.849
Who's doing this?

21:08.450 --> 21:10.660
Give Emma a hand in the kitchen.

21:16.849 --> 21:19.269
- Sorry, no more-- What--?
- Is Gunn here?

21:19.849 --> 21:21.740
No. He left a while ago. Why?

21:22.250 --> 21:24.500
- Where was he going?
- 45th Street.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.769
- I'll start there. I have my phone.
- Check in with me!

21:28.849 --> 21:32.430
- Right.
- Looks like you could use some help.

21:33.049 --> 21:35.329
My staff's too scared to come in.

21:36.049 --> 21:39.839
- Where shall I start?
- How are your laundry-folding skills?

21:40.849 --> 21:43.200
I'm an actress. I can fake it.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.220
Hey! That's my--

21:49.849 --> 21:52.759
Sorry. I have a shirt just like that.

21:53.450 --> 21:57.420
The girl at the store said it was
a one of a kind. Big fibber.

22:01.849 --> 22:03.289
I'm all out of beds.

22:03.650 --> 22:06.740
Come on, it's not safe
for man or beast out here.

22:07.250 --> 22:11.150
I'm very sorry. But I really
don't have any free beds.

22:12.049 --> 22:14.190
You don't have to worry about me.

22:14.450 --> 22:16.940
I can find someone willing to share.

22:18.049 --> 22:19.589
Oh, yes.

22:20.450 --> 22:22.769
Plenty of candidates.

22:24.650 --> 22:28.650
- I think it'd be best if you left.
- You should probably go.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.470
This is a shelter, right?

22:33.049 --> 22:36.490
It just so happens,
I'm in need of shelter tonight.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.319
Hey! Hey!

22:40.250 --> 22:43.200
Let him go. I don't want any trouble.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.609
See y'all later.

22:46.849 --> 22:48.670
Whoa! Watch out, man.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.319
- Jackson.
- Lookie here.

22:53.450 --> 22:55.519
You been ducking me lately, Ray?

22:56.450 --> 22:59.680
- No? You think I'm pissed at you?
- I don't know.

23:00.049 --> 23:03.460
You're shaking, Ray.
What you got to be nervous about?

23:06.650 --> 23:09.279
You don't think
I'm gonna kill you, do you?

23:09.650 --> 23:11.509
- Huh?
- No.

23:13.849 --> 23:17.849
I'd never kill you here.
Not in front of all the pretty ladies.

23:18.049 --> 23:21.170
You know I'd never kill you here.

23:25.849 --> 23:28.269
I'll set up so they don't see it...

23:28.849 --> 23:32.359
- ...or we can't Rodney King the cops.
- That's if we find any.

23:33.049 --> 23:36.630
- Never had to look so hard for trouble.
- Look, 45th Street.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.710
- So?
- This is gang ground.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.640
They catch us, they'll take us out.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.579
- Even cops don't come here.
- I said you're free to go.

23:47.450 --> 23:50.430
I say I'm gonna do something,
I'm gonna do it.

23:51.650 --> 23:55.269
Damn. Somebody have an apocalypse
and forget to invite us?

24:02.450 --> 24:05.890
- What are you doing?
- Doing? Nothing. Taking a walk.

24:06.650 --> 24:09.180
Hands on the wall, spread your feet.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.440
You're arresting us?

24:14.450 --> 24:18.240
- Do as you're instructed.
- I wanna know if we're being arrested.

24:18.650 --> 24:22.720
- Turn around, face the wall. Now.
- I ain't arguing with you...

24:23.450 --> 24:26.539
...but I'd like to know
what law we broke.

24:27.650 --> 24:30.670
We should know if we broke one
so we don't repeat it.

24:31.250 --> 24:32.930
I won't say it again.

24:33.049 --> 24:35.579
Officer, wait! He's a friend of mine.

24:36.650 --> 24:39.809
A very good friend.
I'm sure he hasn't committed any--

24:52.369 --> 24:53.700
Wesley!

25:01.369 --> 25:02.950
He's got another gun!

25:09.769 --> 25:12.049
Oh, man! Oh, man!

25:12.970 --> 25:15.140
- Let's get out of here.
- Get Wesley.

25:17.769 --> 25:20.890
- Is anyone else cold?
- We'll take you someplace warm.

25:21.970 --> 25:23.859
Help me pick him up! Come on!

25:24.970 --> 25:26.299
Come on!

25:27.369 --> 25:29.470
I shot him. I shot a cop.

25:29.769 --> 25:31.589
- Not much choice.
- We gotta move!

25:32.170 --> 25:34.839
I killed a policeman.
Look, he's dead!

25:35.569 --> 25:37.569
- Don't look that dead.
- Let's go!

25:40.369 --> 25:42.930
- We have a situation.
- Any loose ends?

25:43.369 --> 25:45.369
We have witnesses. I need backup.

25:51.170 --> 25:54.859
Hold up. I gotta try to
stop his bleeding. Go!

26:04.970 --> 26:06.200
Around here.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.640
Let him down. Easy! Take it easy!

26:12.170 --> 26:14.910
911, you've got to call 911.

26:15.769 --> 26:19.390
- Screw the cops. They did this to you.
- An ambulance.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.579
Oh.

26:22.369 --> 26:25.210
- All right, go down and keep watch.
- Okay.

26:28.369 --> 26:31.490
- Tell them no sirens.
- 911,what is your emergency?

26:37.609 --> 26:39.329
It's pretty quiet in here.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.220
Can I help you?

26:57.410 --> 27:01.059
I'm investigating complaints about
how officers handle things here.

27:01.609 --> 27:03.400
Isn't that for Internal Affairs?

27:04.009 --> 27:05.940
I'm taking a personal interest.

27:07.609 --> 27:10.700
- Where is everyone?
- Only a few of us at the desk tonight.

27:11.210 --> 27:12.470
Not a lot going on?

27:13.009 --> 27:15.680
Crime's down in this precinct.
We do things right.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.400
- Who takes credit for that?
- It's a team effort.

27:19.009 --> 27:21.779
But the captain got the ball rolling.

27:22.609 --> 27:24.750
- Can we talk to him?
- He's not here.

27:25.009 --> 27:26.549
You can try again later.

27:27.410 --> 27:30.640
This captain, is he
running things by the book?

27:35.210 --> 27:38.230
I don't have to tell you
who used to rule the streets.

27:38.809 --> 27:42.000
The scumbags did. Hell, I was
afraid to drive to work myself.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.059
Oh, really?

27:44.210 --> 27:45.680
We got a tougher policy.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.509
- Ambulance ain't coming.
- Shut up before they hear you.

27:59.809 --> 28:02.440
- I'm not doing very well.
- You'll be fine.

28:03.410 --> 28:05.619
Getting shot like this?

28:05.809 --> 28:09.710
I seen people shot worse than this,
never even slowed them down.

28:16.609 --> 28:17.769
It's here!

28:18.410 --> 28:19.920
Come on, hurry. Move!

28:21.410 --> 28:23.970
Okay, one, two, three.

28:28.609 --> 28:31.349
- Meet me at the shelter.
- All right.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.380
Hey, I'm with him.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.599
It's all right. We're almost there.

28:52.609 --> 28:55.559
Something's going on here.
I'll go see what it is.

28:58.609 --> 28:59.980
Hey, let us through.

29:00.410 --> 29:01.529
No! Don't!

29:02.210 --> 29:03.470
Hey!

29:07.009 --> 29:08.130
Hang on!

29:41.849 --> 29:43.640
Stopping? What are you doing?

29:44.250 --> 29:47.509
Trying to survive. Help me get
him inside. Come on, Wes.

29:49.049 --> 29:51.789
- Here, take this.
- Come on, man, I got you.

29:52.650 --> 29:56.720
Annie, open up! It's G!
Open up! Hurry!

29:59.210 --> 30:01.670
- My God, what happened?
- They shot him.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.309
- Who?
- The cops. They're not human.

30:20.769 --> 30:22.420
All passengers are onboard.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.910
- We have full containment,
- Wait for backup.

30:26.170 --> 30:29.750
Secure the entire section.
Clean house.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.079
He had no right.

30:39.369 --> 30:40.559
I know, man.

30:42.369 --> 30:43.880
Wesley.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.670
- What can I do?
- Apply pressure to the wound.

30:50.769 --> 30:51.680
Okay.

30:53.170 --> 30:55.980
Good. Hang in there. It's okay.

30:59.170 --> 31:01.490
- Are we safe?
- Lock all the doors.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.890
Keep away from the windows!

31:04.569 --> 31:06.670
You heard him. Let's go, come on!

31:11.170 --> 31:12.539
Damn, that looks nasty.

31:12.970 --> 31:14.339
Jackson?

31:14.769 --> 31:15.750
What are you doing?

31:16.569 --> 31:18.640
How do we keep the cops out?

31:18.970 --> 31:20.549
I say let them come, bro.

31:21.970 --> 31:23.509
I know how to handle cops.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.930
That lifestyle working for you?

31:27.369 --> 31:31.940
- Don't get all high and mighty.
- You don't bring down the community.

31:32.769 --> 31:34.869
I'm just doing my thing.

31:35.769 --> 31:39.279
Why does nobody care they're
clamping down on this neighborhood?

31:39.970 --> 31:43.450
- Because they're racist pigs.
- That and people like you.

31:44.170 --> 31:47.079
A thug with a gun,
keeping the cycle going.

31:48.369 --> 31:51.990
- Not my problem.
- It's my problem! They shot my friend!

31:53.170 --> 31:57.839
Yeah, a white man dying.
Not exactly losing sleep on him.

31:59.769 --> 32:02.369
Hey, we can't afford this. Not now!

32:02.769 --> 32:04.869
- All units in place,
- Go.

32:05.769 --> 32:08.329
And keep it quiet, No gunfire,

32:09.369 --> 32:11.440
- He's going south.
- No, come on.

32:12.970 --> 32:13.980
What?

32:14.170 --> 32:18.589
There's internal bleeding.
We gotta get him to St. John's, fast.

32:20.170 --> 32:23.359
- We can't go back out there.
- He's going to die.

32:23.769 --> 32:27.950
We're taking him to a hospital now!
I don't care who's out there!

32:30.369 --> 32:31.700
Get the door.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.750
- Where are we going?
- Hospital.

32:36.970 --> 32:38.509
That sounds sensible.

32:52.569 --> 32:53.650
They're here.

33:02.930 --> 33:04.049
Use this bat.

33:04.130 --> 33:06.730
Everything against the windows.
Move! Quick!

33:16.130 --> 33:17.740
Okay, nail this shut.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.670
Check the kitchen door.

33:35.930 --> 33:36.869
Can I help you?

33:40.730 --> 33:43.569
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.

33:45.529 --> 33:47.250
- Who are you?
- Angel.

33:47.930 --> 33:52.500
Well, Angel, if you need something,
someone downstairs will help you.

33:53.930 --> 33:55.789
I need to talk to you.

33:56.329 --> 33:59.029
- About what?
- About some of your more...

33:59.930 --> 34:01.859
...dead cops.

34:08.329 --> 34:11.099
Maybe we should talk
about you instead.

34:14.329 --> 34:15.800
How do I stop them?

34:23.570 --> 34:24.900
I'll repeat the question.

34:29.809 --> 34:30.889
Move, people!

34:35.210 --> 34:37.530
All circuits are busy,
Please try again,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.809
This is no time for circuits busy!

34:41.210 --> 34:44.230
If the circuits are busy,
get new ones now!

34:49.010 --> 34:50.760
Push them up.

34:56.809 --> 34:59.090
- How do I stop them?
- They're good cops.

34:59.809 --> 35:02.440
They died on the streets!

35:03.409 --> 35:06.110
- You should've left them.
- I won't betray them!

35:12.010 --> 35:13.519
Okay, let's go!

35:18.010 --> 35:20.329
Get the kids in the back, upstairs!

36:08.409 --> 36:10.230
Gunn!

36:10.809 --> 36:12.320
Gunn!

36:12.610 --> 36:13.480
Help!

36:28.610 --> 36:31.070
- Get out.
- How are you controlling them?

36:34.010 --> 36:35.340
The entrails?

36:40.010 --> 36:41.519
The door, it's giving!

36:43.010 --> 36:43.920
Run!

36:58.610 --> 37:01.699
It's the idol of Granath,
the zombie god.

37:02.210 --> 37:03.539
No!

37:20.369 --> 37:21.599
The kids.

37:22.170 --> 37:23.469
Wesley!

37:27.570 --> 37:29.110
Get the ambulance ready.

37:30.570 --> 37:31.969
Help me pick him up.

37:32.650 --> 37:35.769
Sorry. Looks like the streets
just got safer for me.

37:37.449 --> 37:39.170
Time to go to work.

37:40.449 --> 37:42.130
Let's go.

37:44.650 --> 37:45.730
Come on, sweetie.

37:46.449 --> 37:48.199
- Here we go.
- Okay.

37:59.650 --> 38:02.000
I took care of our little cop problem.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.710
Crime reports from that precinct.

38:08.650 --> 38:11.070
There used to be
a murder every two weeks...

38:11.050 --> 38:14.380
...a rape every two days,
a robbery every hour.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.500
That's what we gave back
to the community.

38:18.250 --> 38:19.690
I can live with that.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.579
You learn to live with a lot.

38:27.849 --> 38:29.880
This job is making me crazy.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.690
I know the feeling.

38:35.050 --> 38:37.050
For you, detective.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.530
Thanks.

38:42.849 --> 38:45.309
Wyndam-Pryce. Doesn't he work for you?

39:06.610 --> 39:08.260
Hey.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.809
- Hey.
- How you doing?

39:18.610 --> 39:20.400
I feel I should be in pain.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.940
A gunshot will do that to you.

39:24.010 --> 39:25.130
And yet....

39:28.809 --> 39:30.880
Is this morphine?

39:33.010 --> 39:34.659
Well, it's bloody lovely.

39:58.210 --> 39:59.539
What are you doing here?

40:00.610 --> 40:01.980
I heard about Wesley.

40:02.409 --> 40:06.760
Great. Too bad it takes a gunshot
wound to make you give a crap.

40:08.409 --> 40:10.369
Wesley doesn't need you right now.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.230
We don't need you.

40:14.409 --> 40:17.960
You walked away. Do us
a favor and just stay away.

41:24.610 --> 41:25.869
Thank you,

41:26.305 --> 41:32.592
