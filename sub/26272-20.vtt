WEBVTT

00:02.896 --> 00:05.246
I wish I had better news
for you, Donovan.

00:05.289 --> 00:07.683
That dockworker's testimony...

00:07.726 --> 00:10.381
I'm not sure we can get past it.

00:12.514 --> 00:13.950
How long's it been, Keith?

00:13.994 --> 00:16.518
30 years?

00:16.561 --> 00:19.260
And Donovan's never been
convicted with you at his side.

00:19.303 --> 00:21.479
We thank you for that.

00:21.523 --> 00:22.872
But...

00:22.916 --> 00:24.918
now you got to be
honest with us.

00:24.961 --> 00:27.659
What should we be preparing for?

00:27.703 --> 00:29.661
Barring a miracle,

00:29.705 --> 00:31.707
a "guilty" sentence.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.536
And with Judge Stanley,

00:34.579 --> 00:37.844
a former D.A.,
his history on sentencing

00:37.887 --> 00:40.977
for this type of thing and...
Donovan's record...

00:42.587 --> 00:45.025
we are almost certainly
looking at the maximum.

00:45.068 --> 00:47.201
The full 25 years.

00:47.244 --> 00:50.030
My God...

00:50.073 --> 00:52.684
That's the rest of your life.

00:52.728 --> 00:56.210
He did say "barring a miracle."

00:56.253 --> 00:59.778
I guess I'll just
have to pray for that, huh?

00:59.822 --> 01:02.390
You'll pray, too.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.305
Won't you, son?

01:13.444 --> 01:15.794
Evening, Judge.
How you doing tonight?

01:15.838 --> 01:18.928
Uh, I'll tell you
in a couple of hours.

01:38.992 --> 01:41.298
Hey. Hey, Brendan.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.215
Get in the car. I've got something
I got to do.

01:45.259 --> 01:47.087
No, I know what you think
you got to do,

01:47.130 --> 01:48.934
but just get in the car,
Brendan; you're only gonna

01:48.958 --> 01:51.308
make things worse. Says you. Go
home and study.

01:51.352 --> 01:52.614
Hey, wait.

02:10.632 --> 02:12.088
Drive, Dolittle, drive.
Brendan, what did you do?

02:12.112 --> 02:13.374
Punch it, Doc.

02:20.163 --> 02:22.165
[playing "How Much
Is That Doggie In the Window?"]

02:24.167 --> 02:25.777
Hmm.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.866
Go away. I'm trying
to find a reason to live.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.652
Am I not reason enough?

02:30.695 --> 02:32.151
First thing they teach you
at law school,

02:32.175 --> 02:34.135
don't ask a question
if you don't know the answer.

02:34.177 --> 02:36.571
Good morning to you, too.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.660
They just phoned
from downstairs.

02:38.703 --> 02:42.446
A woman who claims to be
Colleen McCandless

02:42.490 --> 02:44.274
was inquiring whether or not

02:44.318 --> 02:45.841
she could get
an appointment with you.

02:45.884 --> 02:47.147
Right now.

02:47.190 --> 02:48.713
Colleen McCandless...

02:48.757 --> 02:50.150
is married to...

02:50.193 --> 02:51.586
Donovan McCandless.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.110
He's on trial for extortion
and racketeering.

02:54.154 --> 02:55.870
He was supposed
to be sentenced two days ago,

02:55.894 --> 02:58.723
when the judge in the case
inconveniently

02:58.767 --> 03:02.031
got his throat slit
on Montague Street in Brooklyn.

03:02.075 --> 03:04.338
Okay.
Is the conference room free?

03:04.381 --> 03:06.035
Do we have a metal detector?

03:06.079 --> 03:07.994
Answer the second question
first.

03:25.359 --> 03:27.361
Mrs. McCandless? Ten letter word

03:27.404 --> 03:31.017
for the guardianship
and control exercised

03:31.060 --> 03:33.236
by the Lord our God?

03:35.325 --> 03:37.066
Providence.

03:38.198 --> 03:40.200
Thank you.

03:42.724 --> 03:45.379
Sorry to have dropped in
unannounced, Dr. Bull.

03:45.422 --> 03:46.945
Ah, well, how can I be of help?

03:46.989 --> 03:49.513
Or was it just the one word
you came up for?

03:49.557 --> 03:52.081
Do you do crossword puzzles? Once in a
great while.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.605
I can't stand having
nothing to do.

03:54.649 --> 03:56.607
Feeling powerless.

03:56.651 --> 03:59.132
Now that there are
crosswords on my phone...

04:02.091 --> 04:04.528
My two sons...

04:04.572 --> 04:07.575
Brendan, my oldest,
and Connor, who just turned 22...

04:07.618 --> 04:09.446
Were arrested last night.

04:09.490 --> 04:11.840
Charged with the murder
of a judge.

04:11.883 --> 04:14.625
Judge Weston Stanley.

04:14.669 --> 04:16.627
I'm familiar.

04:16.671 --> 04:19.238
It's a federal crime
to kill a federal judge.

04:19.281 --> 04:21.676
Death penalty crime.

04:21.719 --> 04:25.114
And apparently this happened
in the middle of the street

04:25.158 --> 04:27.377
with... a whole lot
of witnesses around

04:27.421 --> 04:29.640
and I'm... sorry,
but I'm actually not sure

04:29.684 --> 04:31.425
how I can be of help to you.

04:31.468 --> 04:33.688
Let's begin at the beginning.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.257
Do you even want to be of help
to me and my family?

04:44.351 --> 04:46.440
You understand
how it looks, right?

04:46.483 --> 04:48.964
Your husband's trial
isn't going well,

04:49.007 --> 04:51.053
so his sons murder the judge

04:51.097 --> 04:53.447
in hopes of getting a mistrial.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.841
See if maybe they can do better
the next time around.

04:58.321 --> 05:00.236
You didn't answer my question.

05:02.325 --> 05:05.676
I'm not in the habit of
assisting career criminals, no.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.158
My sons were apprehended
in a car

05:09.202 --> 05:11.291
identified at the scene
of the crime.

05:11.334 --> 05:13.989
And the knife that was used
to slit the judge's throat

05:14.032 --> 05:16.644
was found in
my oldest's possession.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.080
Okay.

05:18.124 --> 05:19.995
Are you trying to convince me?

05:20.038 --> 05:22.171
I think you should also know
that my firstborn

05:22.215 --> 05:24.086
has a very lengthy
criminal record.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.827
Duly noted.

05:25.870 --> 05:28.482
I'm not unaware that juries
go in with opinions

05:28.525 --> 05:31.789
already formed about what
it must be to be a McCandless.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.835
My attorney indicated

05:33.878 --> 05:36.229
that this sort of challenge
was your specialty.

05:36.272 --> 05:40.189
As I mentioned previously...
I'm not asking you to help

05:40.233 --> 05:41.538
a career criminal.

05:41.582 --> 05:44.498
I'm not asking you
to help my older son.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.674
Just my youngest.

05:46.717 --> 05:48.241
Just Connor. He's innocent.

05:49.503 --> 05:51.244
He's why I'm here.

05:53.246 --> 05:56.771
So you just want me
to help the one,

05:56.814 --> 05:58.947
not the other son? Brendan's lost to me.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.775
Has been for a long time.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.385
He's...

06:02.429 --> 06:05.910
Runs call girls and numbers,
he's his father's boy.

06:05.954 --> 06:08.304
But Connor, my youngest...

06:08.348 --> 06:09.890
he's never been involved
in the business.

06:09.914 --> 06:12.178
He's a year into med school.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.226
No one in our family has ever
even gotten a college degree,

06:17.270 --> 06:19.272
let alone thought about
becoming a doctor.

06:19.315 --> 06:22.231
Mrs. McCandless... Connor didn't
choose his father.

06:22.275 --> 06:24.190
I did.

06:27.367 --> 06:28.933
He shouldn't have
even been there.

06:30.587 --> 06:32.110
It was my fault.

06:32.154 --> 06:33.547
I asked him to go.

06:33.590 --> 06:35.549
I don't understand.

06:35.592 --> 06:38.160
How is it your fault?
Connor was the one driving

06:38.204 --> 06:39.920
the getaway car.
I knew my husband and Brendan

06:39.944 --> 06:41.400
were up to something
and I called Connor

06:41.424 --> 06:43.252
and I told him he needed
to get into the car

06:43.296 --> 06:46.473
and get his brother, make sure
he didn't do anything stupid.

06:49.954 --> 06:51.304
It's my fault.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.482
You at all interested
in my opinion?

06:55.525 --> 06:56.918
I'm pretty sure I can guess.

06:56.961 --> 06:58.528
You know, these guys...

06:58.572 --> 07:01.227
they're accused of
killing a judge.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.316
Before we even walk
through the door,

07:03.359 --> 07:05.100
everyone in that courthouse

07:05.143 --> 07:06.512
is going to be against us.
Two things:

07:06.536 --> 07:07.929
I haven't agreed
to take the case.

07:07.972 --> 07:09.322
Only to meet the younger son.

07:09.365 --> 07:10.777
And what's the
second thing? The younger son

07:10.801 --> 07:12.803
is the only one
we would represent.

07:12.847 --> 07:15.328
And he didn't pick his father.

07:15.371 --> 07:17.286
I'd also point out

07:17.330 --> 07:18.809
that we have represented clients

07:18.853 --> 07:21.159
accused of every kind
of crime there is

07:21.203 --> 07:22.789
and the courtroom is always
biased against the accused.

07:22.813 --> 07:25.425
Yes, but in this case,
the accused

07:25.468 --> 07:27.296
is a member of a crime family.

07:27.340 --> 07:30.256
Whether he chose to
be a member or not.

07:30.299 --> 07:32.214
And as a former prosecutor,

07:32.258 --> 07:34.782
I have a difficult time
turning a blind eye to that.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.566
And-and look, I
get it. I get it.

07:36.610 --> 07:38.220
Everybody deserves a defense.

07:38.264 --> 07:40.962
But Donovan McCandless
and his clan?

07:41.005 --> 07:44.226
Benny, the only promise I made
was to meet the boy.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.708
All right.
You're the boss.

07:51.538 --> 07:54.628
I wasn't there to help him,
I was there to stop him.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.717
After I talked to my mom,

07:56.760 --> 07:58.588
I-I called Brendan.
But his phone was off.

07:58.632 --> 08:00.808
So I started
asking around to see

08:00.851 --> 08:02.592
if anybody knew where he was.

08:02.636 --> 08:05.073
This guy my father works with
told me that Brendan had been

08:05.116 --> 08:07.510
trying to get the home address
of Judge Stanley.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.860
I put two and two together.

08:09.904 --> 08:12.428
Got on the Internet,
it took about five minutes.

08:12.472 --> 08:13.864
I mean...

08:13.908 --> 08:15.692
my brother's done
some bad things before,

08:15.736 --> 08:17.564
but I thought...

08:17.607 --> 08:19.522
i-if I could just talk to him.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.351
So when I got there, it seemed
like I had made it in time.

08:22.395 --> 08:24.527
But I couldn't get him
to get in the car with me.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.964
A-And the next thing I know,
the judge is leaving his house

08:27.008 --> 08:30.185
and Brendan sneaks up
behind him...

08:30.228 --> 08:33.231
slits his throat,
then jumps in the car with me

08:33.275 --> 08:35.885
and orders me to drive away. Orders you?

08:35.929 --> 08:38.280
H-He put a pistol to my head.

08:40.674 --> 08:43.633
Anyway, like five minutes later,
the cops pulled us over.

08:43.677 --> 08:47.289
What'd you tell them? Uh, nothing.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.944
Some things you just learn
sitting at the kitchen table.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.381
I learned young not to talk.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.252
So you didn't tell them

08:54.296 --> 08:55.602
that story you just told us?

08:55.645 --> 08:57.255
Okay.

08:57.299 --> 08:59.736
Well, if we got involved,

08:59.780 --> 09:02.826
I'd want to file
a motion to sever

09:02.870 --> 09:04.611
your trial from your brother's.

09:04.654 --> 09:07.788
Right now, you're being
charged together with murder.

09:07.831 --> 09:10.921
Meaning, you'll both be tried
at the same time

09:10.965 --> 09:12.270
with the same jury.

09:12.314 --> 09:14.229
We'd be requesting
for your trials to be

09:14.272 --> 09:15.883
completely separated.

09:15.926 --> 09:17.319
The more we can distance you

09:17.363 --> 09:19.103
from your family's reputation,
the better.

09:19.147 --> 09:21.584
Benny's right;
your best chance

09:21.628 --> 09:23.673
is for you to just
tell the truth.

09:23.717 --> 09:25.564
Explain that you were trying
to stop your brother

09:25.588 --> 09:27.416
and the only reason
you drove away

09:27.460 --> 09:29.113
is that you were afraid
for your life.

09:29.157 --> 09:30.854
I don't think you understand.

09:30.898 --> 09:32.943
I can't say that.

09:32.987 --> 09:36.599
I'd effectively be testifying
against my own brother.Connor.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.993
If you won't
speak up for yourself

09:39.036 --> 09:41.387
against Brendan,
we don't have a case.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.214
You don't have a case.

09:43.258 --> 09:45.042
Look...

09:45.086 --> 09:48.089
I never wanted anything to do
with my family's business.

09:48.132 --> 09:51.179
But that doesn't mean
that I don't love my family.

09:51.222 --> 09:53.877
My brother and I
have always been different.

09:53.921 --> 09:57.141
But there were times when we
were all each other had.

09:57.185 --> 10:00.057
We made a pact a long time ago.

10:00.101 --> 10:02.799
We do not turn on each other,
we protect each other.

10:02.843 --> 10:04.627
No matter what.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.412
No offense, but...
it doesn't sound like

10:06.455 --> 10:09.023
he was honoring that pact
when he put a gun to your head.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.938
He was scared.

10:10.981 --> 10:13.810
Brendan's always been scared.

10:13.854 --> 10:17.466
Of Dad, of being a screwup.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.163
Being a disappointment.

10:21.296 --> 10:23.080
Brendan would never hurt me.

10:23.124 --> 10:26.170
You could spend the rest
of your life in prison.

10:26.214 --> 10:28.869
And if I testify against him,

10:28.912 --> 10:30.827
he could get the death penalty.

10:30.871 --> 10:34.091
I'm not gonna be responsible
for killing my brother.

10:37.138 --> 10:39.445
Well, notwithstanding
the investment in time,

10:39.488 --> 10:41.185
I think that worked out
for the best.

10:41.229 --> 10:44.145
I'm telling you,
no good could come

10:44.188 --> 10:46.123
from representing people
who have spent their lives

10:46.147 --> 10:47.583
engaging in criminal activity.

10:47.627 --> 10:50.847
As far as I can tell,
that boy's never spent a minute

10:50.891 --> 10:53.676
doing anything outside the law.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.026
I'm telling his mother
we're taking the case.

10:56.070 --> 10:58.681
Excuse me?

10:58.725 --> 11:02.380
Wa... was I not
in the same room as you?

11:02.424 --> 11:05.862
The boy does not want to be
pitted against his brother.

11:05.906 --> 11:07.473
He made that point
crystal clear.

11:07.516 --> 11:10.171
And the only way in hell
to get him off

11:10.214 --> 11:12.434
is to sever his trial
from the man

11:12.478 --> 11:15.959
who did the actual killing;
and he won't do it.

11:16.003 --> 11:17.221
What am I missing?

11:17.265 --> 11:20.398
You haven't met the mother.

11:20.442 --> 11:21.791
He'll do it.

11:21.835 --> 11:26.100
He'll do whatever
Mommy tells him to do.

11:38.102 --> 11:39.538
You gotta know
this wasn't my idea.

11:39.581 --> 11:42.845
I wasn't born yesterday.

11:42.889 --> 11:44.021
All rise.

11:44.064 --> 11:47.502
The Honorable Judge Hamilton
presiding.

11:50.114 --> 11:53.291
I understand you'd like to be
heard on a motion, Mr. Colรณn?

11:53.334 --> 11:55.728
Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.

11:55.771 --> 11:59.079
My client, defendant
Connor McCandless,

11:59.123 --> 12:01.603
is asking for the court's
permission to sever his trial

12:01.647 --> 12:04.084
from that of codefendant,
Brendan McCandless.

12:04.128 --> 12:05.192
Your Honor, for the record,

12:05.216 --> 12:06.739
the prosecution
vehemently objects

12:06.782 --> 12:08.306
on the grounds...

12:08.349 --> 12:10.743
Motion denied.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.791
Forgive me, Your Honor,
I was not

12:15.835 --> 12:18.751
given the opportunity
to argue the motion.

12:18.794 --> 12:21.362
The law's the law, Counselor.

12:21.406 --> 12:24.278
Any argument you choose to make
would be beside the point.

12:24.322 --> 12:28.065
I... I beg to differ,
Your Honor.

12:28.108 --> 12:31.764
I think it's only reasonable
that you hear out

12:31.807 --> 12:34.419
the particular circumstances
surrounding...

12:34.462 --> 12:36.638
Are you calling me
unreasonable, Counselor?

12:38.640 --> 12:41.600
This court finds you
in contempt, Mr. Colรณn.

12:41.643 --> 12:45.125
Really? You can't be serious.

12:45.169 --> 12:49.260
This court hereby fines you
$1,000. Serious enough?

12:49.303 --> 12:50.348
But, Your Honor...

12:50.391 --> 12:51.740
Let's make it 2,000.

12:51.784 --> 12:55.266
And lest you mistake
my intentions here,

12:55.309 --> 12:57.616
if I hear one more word
from you, Mr. Colรณn,

12:57.659 --> 12:59.052
you will be taken into custody.

13:00.923 --> 13:03.012
Now...

13:03.056 --> 13:04.884
is there anything else?

13:04.927 --> 13:07.800
That's everything, Your Honor.

13:07.843 --> 13:10.194
Very well, then.

13:10.237 --> 13:13.240
The trial begins this afternoon,
1:00 p.m.

13:13.284 --> 13:16.765
Court's adjourned.

13:24.643 --> 13:26.558
Please tell me you got it.

13:26.601 --> 13:29.126
Okay. But I'd be lying.

13:29.169 --> 13:30.257
I'm not doing any better.

13:30.301 --> 13:31.911
My number one source over there

13:31.954 --> 13:34.653
put me on hold 17 minutes ago.

13:34.696 --> 13:36.394
I've called in
every favor I can,

13:36.437 --> 13:38.918
but no one is willing
to slip us the jury list.

13:38.961 --> 13:41.268
Who knew?
Nobody at the courthouse

13:41.312 --> 13:44.141
is willing to help the folks who
are defending the judge killer.

13:44.184 --> 13:45.490
Everybody over there
looked at me

13:45.533 --> 13:47.666
like I had stole their dog.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.146
Ah...

13:49.189 --> 13:50.843
So, what did Marissa
have to say?

13:50.886 --> 13:53.498
Well, looks like we're
gonna do voir dire old-school.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.196
No earwig, no jury list,
no research in advance.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.330
Just you, me and
a yellow legal pad

13:59.373 --> 14:00.853
flying by the seat of our pants.

14:00.896 --> 14:03.160
Oh, so it's not just
the judge who hates us.

14:03.203 --> 14:05.901
No, I'd say the entire
courthouse is united

14:05.945 --> 14:07.773
in their contempt for TAC.

14:07.816 --> 14:09.209
I hate to say I told you so.

14:09.253 --> 14:10.993
No, you don't.

14:11.037 --> 14:13.474
So, what's the game plan,
General Custer?

14:12.587 --> 14:14.371
We'll be battling
something called

14:14.415 --> 14:16.895
an "anchoring bias,"
which is when a person

14:16.939 --> 14:18.810
possesses a trait so dominant

14:18.854 --> 14:20.310
that it colors everything else
about them.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.137
It could be age, it could
be race, it could be income.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.643
Or even a family's reputation. Precisely.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.080
And, lucky us, we won't
just have one McCandless

14:28.124 --> 14:29.797
sitting at the defense table,
we'll have two.

14:29.821 --> 14:31.519
That's quite an anchor.

14:32.576 --> 14:35.100
What we really need
are people with

14:35.144 --> 14:37.189
a kind of tunnel vision.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.061
People who are prone
to making decisions

14:39.104 --> 14:41.193
based solely on what they have

14:41.237 --> 14:43.171
directly in front of them,
as opposed to all the baggage

14:43.195 --> 14:45.372
a person might bring into
the courtroom with them.

14:45.415 --> 14:48.549
So, who do you like?

14:48.592 --> 14:50.551
See juror number nine? Mm.

14:50.594 --> 14:52.030
Holding a newspaper.

14:52.074 --> 14:53.554
It's open to
the movie timetable.

14:53.597 --> 14:55.251
Let's start with him.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.470
Good afternoon.

14:56.513 --> 14:58.341
All right.

14:58.385 --> 15:01.910
Sir, I couldn't help
but notice your newspaper.

15:01.953 --> 15:03.955
You had it open to the
movie page. You a fan?

15:03.999 --> 15:05.435
All my life.
Okay.

15:05.479 --> 15:09.874
So, let's say you head
over to the movies.

15:09.918 --> 15:12.486
You've got it in your head
to see that big blockbuster

15:12.529 --> 15:14.183
everybody's been talking about.

15:14.226 --> 15:16.925
But when you get over there,
it's all sold out.

15:16.968 --> 15:19.928
The only movie you can
still get tickets to

15:19.971 --> 15:22.757
is one that does not
have good word of mouth.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.149
You still buying a ticket?

15:24.193 --> 15:25.760
Probably.

15:25.803 --> 15:28.284
Frankly, I don't much care
what anyone else thinks.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.870
And when I'm in the mood
to see a movie,

15:29.894 --> 15:31.983
I'm in the mood to see a movie.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.033
We could also use
some black sheep.

15:38.076 --> 15:40.470
Jurors who know what it's like
to be stuck in a group,

15:40.514 --> 15:43.604
and branded with a label
they did nothing to earn.

15:43.647 --> 15:45.301
Show of hands.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.825
How many of you are
under the age of 30?

15:50.001 --> 15:53.962
Okay, now, how many of you
own three devices or more?

15:54.005 --> 15:58.227
Phone, laptop, desktop, tablet.

15:58.270 --> 16:01.361
Okay. Two devices or more?

16:03.580 --> 16:06.496
Just one device?

16:06.540 --> 16:10.326
You, sir, do you not
own a cell phone?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.850
I did, but I don't.

16:12.894 --> 16:15.375
No laptop, tablet?

16:15.418 --> 16:18.029
I know, it's like I'm
a traitor to my generation.

16:18.073 --> 16:20.815
But I really prefer
reading books and newspapers,

16:20.858 --> 16:22.401
and choosing when
I want to talk to someone,

16:22.425 --> 16:24.732
and when I want to be
available to be talked to.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.342
I like my music on vinyl,

16:26.386 --> 16:28.562
and I do most
of my shopping in person.

16:31.260 --> 16:34.611
Your Honor, this juror is
acceptable to the defense.

16:37.135 --> 16:38.702
Didn't see the mother
in court today.

16:38.746 --> 16:41.662
Yeah, well, I figured
the potential jurors

16:41.705 --> 16:44.360
had enough McCandless
family members to look at.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.928
Did you convince Connor
to take the stand,

16:46.971 --> 16:48.669
talk about his brother?

16:49.931 --> 16:51.759
Not yet.
Not that I've heard.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.804
Not that I'm... aware of.

16:53.848 --> 16:55.458
How long have we
known each other?

16:55.502 --> 16:57.068
Long time.

16:57.112 --> 17:00.463
We both know these people do not
testify against each other.

17:00.507 --> 17:02.422
Do not rat on each other.

17:02.465 --> 17:03.727
Just doesn't happen.

17:03.771 --> 17:05.859
And then I heard

17:05.903 --> 17:08.036
a scream...

17:08.079 --> 17:10.430
and I knew something terrible
had happened.

17:10.473 --> 17:13.040
And when I turned around,

17:13.084 --> 17:17.088
he was on the ground,
and blood was just...

17:17.132 --> 17:19.047
pouring out of him.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.049
And did you see the attacker?

17:21.092 --> 17:22.703
Yes.

17:22.746 --> 17:24.835
He's that man.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.664
For the record,
the witness has identified

17:27.708 --> 17:30.101
the defendant,
Mr. Brendan McCandless.

17:31.538 --> 17:32.756
And then what happened?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.717
That man, who slit
the judge's throat,

17:36.760 --> 17:40.938
he ran back to his getaway car
and pulled off his mask.

17:40.982 --> 17:45.203
That's when I saw him,
as he was getting into his car.

17:45.247 --> 17:47.945
A-a silver sedan.

17:47.989 --> 17:51.122
Was this the car? Yes.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.950
And did you see the driver?

17:52.994 --> 17:55.126
Yes.

17:55.170 --> 17:57.477
For the record,
the witness has identified

17:57.520 --> 18:01.350
the defendant,
Mr. Connor McCandless.

18:01.393 --> 18:04.135
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.356
Ms. Hartley, I believe
you used the expression

18:07.399 --> 18:09.010
"getaway car," am I correct?

18:09.053 --> 18:10.620
I think so, yes.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.753
And when you were interviewed
by the police,

18:12.796 --> 18:14.276
you told them you were standing

18:14.319 --> 18:16.408
about 50 feet away
from the vehicle.

18:16.452 --> 18:17.801
That's correct.

18:17.845 --> 18:19.977
And could you see anything
inside the vehicle?

18:20.021 --> 18:22.502
No, it-it was too dark.

18:22.545 --> 18:26.941
But you just identified
the driver as my client.

18:26.984 --> 18:28.246
Can you explain that?

18:28.290 --> 18:33.077
When the car took off,
it drove right by me,

18:33.121 --> 18:34.426
and I could actually see

18:34.470 --> 18:37.125
right into
the driver's side window.

18:37.168 --> 18:39.519
That's when I saw your client.

18:39.562 --> 18:41.521
I see, but...

18:41.564 --> 18:46.830
at the moment the judge's killer
actually entered the car,

18:46.874 --> 18:50.312
you couldn't see if he
punched the driver

18:50.355 --> 18:52.009
or held a gun
to the driver's head,

18:52.053 --> 18:54.490
or forced him in some way
to drive?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.448
Well, no, but... Thank you.

18:56.492 --> 18:58.581
No further questions,
Your Honor.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.279
So much for the eyewitness.

19:01.323 --> 19:02.585
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

19:02.629 --> 19:04.544
It didn't move the needle
over here.

19:06.807 --> 19:08.504
I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

19:08.548 --> 19:09.908
but have you heard
from the mother?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.246
No.

19:11.289 --> 19:12.987
Connor said anything to you?

19:13.030 --> 19:14.834
'Cause he certainly hasn't
said anything to me.

19:14.858 --> 19:15.946
No.

19:17.644 --> 19:19.254
Well, not to belabor
the obvious,

19:19.297 --> 19:21.473
but in the very near future,
the prosecution

19:21.517 --> 19:23.084
is gonna rest their case.

19:23.127 --> 19:25.086
And all we really have
is Connor.

19:25.129 --> 19:27.194
And if he's unwilling to talk
about what his brother did...

19:27.218 --> 19:28.263
I know.

19:28.306 --> 19:30.613
Tomorrow at lunch,
we'll sit him down,

19:30.657 --> 19:32.093
we'll have the talk.

19:32.136 --> 19:34.486
In fact, I'll call his mom
tonight, make sure she's there.

19:34.530 --> 19:38.142
Get this done, once and for all.

19:38.186 --> 19:41.058
Thank you.

19:48.109 --> 19:49.850
Counselors, if you're ready
to begin...

19:49.893 --> 19:52.896
Actually, Your Honor,
Mr. O'Leary and I

19:52.940 --> 19:55.682
have a bit of business
before you bring in the jury.

19:55.725 --> 19:57.727
Yes, Mr. O'Leary?

19:57.771 --> 20:00.948
Your Honor, the defendant,
Brendan McCandless,

20:00.991 --> 20:02.950
would like to change
his plea to guilty.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.431
And he also agreed to testify
on behalf of the prosecution

20:06.475 --> 20:08.651
against Connor McCandless.

20:08.695 --> 20:10.435
Order!

20:10.479 --> 20:11.959
Order in the court!

20:12.002 --> 20:13.351
Brendan?

20:14.831 --> 20:16.703
So, what exactly does this mean?

20:16.746 --> 20:18.879
It means your older son
is gonna lie

20:18.922 --> 20:21.621
and sacrifice Connor
to save himself.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.120
"Connor McCandless was the
architect of the judge's murder.

20:27.164 --> 20:29.470
"Connor McCandless drove
the getaway car.

20:29.514 --> 20:31.274
Connor McCandless provided
the murder weapon."

20:31.298 --> 20:34.649
Now, this... is a copy
of your brother's statement,

20:34.693 --> 20:36.956
and this is what he's gonna
say about you in court.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.654
He testifies against you,
and in exchange,

20:39.698 --> 20:42.048
the death penalty is
off the table.

20:43.876 --> 20:48.228
I have spent my whole life
being loyal to my brother.

20:48.272 --> 20:51.188
I know.
We all know.

20:51.231 --> 20:53.756
But there are times you just
have to look out for yourself.

20:53.799 --> 20:55.496
This is one of those times.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.543
Maybe he just doesn't
really understand.

20:58.586 --> 20:59.762
Could you talk to him?

20:59.805 --> 21:01.502
Make sure he knows
what he's doing.

21:01.546 --> 21:03.983
Connor, I promise you,
he knows what he's doing.

21:04.027 --> 21:05.700
I know this isn't gonna
make you feel any better,

21:05.724 --> 21:07.813
but a man will make a lot
of selfish decisions

21:07.857 --> 21:11.774
when facing the prospect of
death by lethal injection.

21:11.817 --> 21:14.864
And now, what happens
to his deal

21:14.907 --> 21:16.996
if I go up there
and I tell the truth?

21:17.040 --> 21:18.258
Well, if the court finds that

21:18.302 --> 21:21.131
Brendan's statement
was not truthful,

21:21.174 --> 21:22.915
then he will have
perjured himself.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.351
And that will negate
the plea deal.

21:24.395 --> 21:26.701
That would mean

21:26.745 --> 21:30.270
that the death penalty would
be back on the table for him.

21:30.314 --> 21:33.099
Look at me.

21:33.143 --> 21:34.797
There's nothing to think about.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.929
Your brother murdered a man.

21:36.973 --> 21:39.932
You did nothing
but try and stop him.

21:39.976 --> 21:42.500
Your whole life's been
about trying to help people.

21:42.543 --> 21:44.545
His life has been
about preying on them.

21:44.589 --> 21:46.112
Whose soul is it

21:46.156 --> 21:49.072
you think the Lord wants
to survive?

21:51.248 --> 21:53.598
Okay.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.124
You were right about her.

21:58.168 --> 21:59.647
She's a force, all right. Yeah,

21:59.691 --> 22:01.649
I still think we have
a problem, though.

22:01.693 --> 22:04.087
I mean, if I'm a juror,
and I'm looking at two kids

22:04.130 --> 22:07.264
named McCandless pointing
the finger at each other, I...

22:07.307 --> 22:09.266
I don't know if I believe either
one of them.

22:09.309 --> 22:11.398
Benny. Brendan McCandless
has a rap sheet

22:11.442 --> 22:13.618
longer than the New York State
Thruway, and Connor?

22:13.661 --> 22:15.228
He's clean as a whistle.

22:15.272 --> 22:19.711
Still. Wish we had someone
whose name wasn't McCandless

22:19.754 --> 22:22.975
to back up Connor's version
of what happened that night.

22:23.019 --> 22:24.759
Hmm.

22:24.803 --> 22:25.935
I just had a thought.

22:26.489 --> 22:29.013
Okay.
- So...

22:29.057 --> 22:30.948
I've been knocking on every door
of every apartment,

22:30.972 --> 22:33.366
brownstone, storefront
in the area,

22:33.409 --> 22:35.518
and I haven't found a single
witness who can corroborate

22:35.542 --> 22:37.520
Connor's story about his brother
forcing him to drive.

22:37.544 --> 22:39.459
Then I realized,

22:39.502 --> 22:43.114
all of this happened
at 7:00 at night. Dinnertime.

22:43.158 --> 22:45.682
There's lots of food
being delivered.

22:46.770 --> 22:49.556
Any way I can get you
to tap into

22:49.599 --> 22:51.775
the different
food delivery apps,

22:51.819 --> 22:53.908
and get me some names
of the delivery people

22:53.951 --> 22:56.084
that I can interview
who might be in the area?

22:56.127 --> 22:57.477
Legally?

23:05.354 --> 23:06.877
Sorry, we're not open.

23:06.921 --> 23:09.619
Ah, my name's Dr. Jason Bull.
I'm supposed to meet a friend?

23:09.663 --> 23:12.187
She's by the patio.

23:13.710 --> 23:15.320
Hey.

23:15.364 --> 23:16.974
Hi.

23:17.018 --> 23:19.150
Thanks for meeting me
before court. Well,

23:19.194 --> 23:21.326
I hope I didn't keep you
waiting too long.

23:21.370 --> 23:22.893
Never heard of this place.

23:22.937 --> 23:24.460
It's mine.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.462
Uh, my grandmother's, actually,

23:26.506 --> 23:29.291
but then it became mine.

23:29.334 --> 23:32.337
Only thing that I have
that's truly my own.

23:32.381 --> 23:33.948
Hmm.

23:33.991 --> 23:36.646
Only thing that has absolutely
nothing to do with Donovan.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.779
The only place I can come

23:38.822 --> 23:40.781
where nobody cares
who my husband is.

23:42.696 --> 23:44.698
Best Irish stew in the city,
if you're a fan.

23:44.741 --> 23:47.614
Well, I'll have
to keep that in mind.

23:53.837 --> 23:55.796
So tell me it's gonna
be all right.

23:55.839 --> 23:58.494
I can't.

23:58.538 --> 24:02.019
Connor will be a far more
credible witness than Brendan.

24:02.063 --> 24:03.519
But no matter what they say
about each other,

24:03.543 --> 24:05.632
Brendan pled guilty.

24:05.675 --> 24:08.635
And so, if we can't present
enough evidence

24:08.678 --> 24:11.812
to show that Connor wasn't
a willing participant,

24:11.855 --> 24:14.162
they will both go to prison.

24:14.205 --> 24:16.120
You think I'm a monster?

24:17.992 --> 24:19.733
Praying for one of my boys
to lose his life

24:19.776 --> 24:21.909
so the other can have one?

24:23.476 --> 24:26.827
I think you've seen enough to
know how Brendan's story ends.

24:26.870 --> 24:31.309
And Connor, well,

24:31.353 --> 24:34.443
his story hasn't
been written yet.

24:36.793 --> 24:39.492
And for what it's worth, I think
it takes a lot of courage

24:39.535 --> 24:42.495
to fight for the son
you cansave.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.761
You know, I tried
to save Brendan, too.

24:49.806 --> 24:51.460
He's so good with his hands.

24:53.331 --> 24:55.595
Always fixing things.

24:55.638 --> 24:59.381
I reached out to a cousin
in Ohio, a plane mechanic?

24:59.424 --> 25:01.731
I thought maybe, you know...

25:03.690 --> 25:07.563
Brendan couldn't bring himself
to walk away.

25:07.607 --> 25:12.307
Maybe he was afraid of what
his father would think or do.

25:12.350 --> 25:15.092
Or maybe it's just
who Brendan is.

25:17.530 --> 25:20.924
Who he's always been.

25:26.408 --> 25:29.542
So what if I took the stand?

25:29.585 --> 25:33.197
Put my hand on the Bible
and swore to God

25:33.241 --> 25:37.767
I was afraid of what Brendan
might do that night?

25:37.811 --> 25:42.772
Tell-tell the court how I made
Connor go stop Brendan?

25:42.816 --> 25:45.645
I'm sorry, Mrs. McCandless.

25:45.688 --> 25:48.169
I don't think
it'll make a difference.

25:48.212 --> 25:50.040
You weren't there
when the judge was killed.

25:50.084 --> 25:52.042
And you may have told Connor
to stop Brendan,

25:52.086 --> 25:55.437
but we can't prove
that Connor listened.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.792
So what do we do?

26:02.836 --> 26:05.969
We go to court. We fight.

26:06.013 --> 26:10.365
And in about an hour,
your son Brendan takes the stand

26:10.408 --> 26:12.367
and says whatever he's been
prompted to say,

26:12.410 --> 26:14.064
a pack of lies, I'm sure.

26:15.544 --> 26:17.328
And we put on
the best defense possible,

26:17.372 --> 26:20.375
ask the toughest questions.

26:20.418 --> 26:24.509
And put our faith
in the wisdom of juries.

26:33.910 --> 26:35.346
Ms. Vasquez, Mr. O'Leary,

26:35.390 --> 26:37.000
this court is not

26:37.044 --> 26:38.499
in the habit of waiting
for a witness,

26:38.523 --> 26:40.656
particularly when that witness
is the accused.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.050
Can either one of you
provide any clarity?

26:48.838 --> 26:50.231
I...

26:50.274 --> 26:52.494
To the best of my knowledge,
he's in the prison van

26:52.537 --> 26:53.800
on his way here, Your Honor.

26:58.761 --> 27:01.590
Think he got cold
feet about testifying?

27:01.634 --> 27:03.723
From your lips.

27:03.766 --> 27:05.289
Your Honor.

27:15.691 --> 27:17.331
Marshal, can you please clear
the gallery?

27:36.669 --> 27:39.280
I was just informed that
the government's next witness,

27:39.323 --> 27:41.717
Brendan McCandless, was murdered

27:41.761 --> 27:43.763
in the prison yard this morning.

27:49.263 --> 27:52.701
I know this is sort of
a tactless question,

27:52.745 --> 27:55.965
but is this good for our
side or bad for our side?

27:58.011 --> 28:01.014
In my opinion, it would've
been almost impossible

28:01.058 --> 28:03.756
to overcome Brendan's testimony.

28:03.799 --> 28:07.107
His death may have
actually saved our case.

28:07.151 --> 28:09.153
What do you say?

28:09.196 --> 28:10.545
The fact remains,

28:10.589 --> 28:12.219
a federal judge
was murdered in cold blood

28:12.243 --> 28:15.811
and that jury is gonna
want someone to pay.

28:15.855 --> 28:18.162
And now our client's
the only one left to do it.

28:20.555 --> 28:22.818
Bad time? Good time?

28:22.862 --> 28:23.819
What do you got?

28:23.863 --> 28:26.083
Well, I just back from Rikers.

28:26.126 --> 28:28.128
Turns out, the inmate

28:28.172 --> 28:32.219
who stabbed Brendan has a
reputation as a killer for hire.

28:33.525 --> 28:35.483
I think we all assumed as much.

28:35.527 --> 28:38.530
A McCandless is killed
in prison, it's probably a hit.

28:38.573 --> 28:42.708
But that's not all.
The killer grew up with Connor.

28:42.751 --> 28:45.189
Wait. Are you saying
that Connor...

28:45.232 --> 28:48.409
I'm not saying anything.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.373
Connor.

28:56.461 --> 28:58.854
It's me and Benny.

28:58.898 --> 29:00.682
We just wanted to let you know

29:00.726 --> 29:03.816
how badly we feel
about your brother.

29:03.859 --> 29:06.079
And you don't need
to get dressed.

29:06.123 --> 29:07.559
We've asked for a continuance.

29:07.602 --> 29:09.735
Oh, no. Can you undo it?

29:11.128 --> 29:13.008
I don't think I'm gonna
feel any better tomorrow

29:13.042 --> 29:14.609
than I'm gonna feel today.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.308
I don't think I'm ever
gonna feel any better.

29:17.351 --> 29:20.485
I really just want to get

29:20.528 --> 29:23.357
this over with, uh,
however it turns out.

29:23.401 --> 29:24.532
This continuance

29:24.576 --> 29:28.493
isn't really about how you feel.

29:28.536 --> 29:32.061
Your brother's killer.
We know you knew him.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.412
We know you know him.

29:34.455 --> 29:37.589
We went to Catholic school
together.

29:37.632 --> 29:40.809
I haven't seen him in, like,
I don't know, five years?

29:40.853 --> 29:42.681
And before that,
we weren't close.

29:42.724 --> 29:45.249
Maybe not since s-sixth grade.

29:45.292 --> 29:46.772
What are you implying?

29:46.815 --> 29:48.774
I'm not implying anything.

29:48.817 --> 29:50.360
I'm asking you the question
that's gonna be

29:50.384 --> 29:52.865
on everyone's mind when we walk
back into that courtroom.

29:52.908 --> 29:54.867
Did you have
your brother killed?

29:56.347 --> 29:58.958
Seriously? - Connor,

29:59.001 --> 30:00.960
it's our job to protect you.

30:01.003 --> 30:03.005
And to do that, we have to ask.

30:03.049 --> 30:06.835
No. God, no.

30:06.879 --> 30:08.533
He was my brother.

30:08.576 --> 30:10.230
I believe you.

30:10.274 --> 30:13.320
But we need to be mindful
of appearances.

30:13.364 --> 30:16.062
Less than 24 hours ago,
Brendan was killed,

30:16.105 --> 30:18.195
and we are about to walk
back into that courtroom

30:18.238 --> 30:20.893
with the one person
who could contradict

30:20.936 --> 30:24.984
your version of events
no longer able to do so.

30:25.027 --> 30:26.638
How do you think that looks?

30:26.681 --> 30:28.988
Yeah, but the jurors won't know.

30:30.903 --> 30:33.993
Jurors always promise not to
watch the news, read the paper

30:34.036 --> 30:35.864
or go on the Internet.

30:35.908 --> 30:37.344
But somehow, miraculously,

30:37.388 --> 30:39.999
they always know
what's going on in the world.

30:40.042 --> 30:43.263
And I can guarantee you they
will know about Brendan's death.

30:43.307 --> 30:46.048
In fact, I'm sure
they already do.

30:46.092 --> 30:47.963
And like it or not,
they're all gonna

30:48.007 --> 30:49.356
come to their own conclusions

30:49.400 --> 30:52.272
about who had the most to gain
by killing him.

30:54.927 --> 30:57.146
Let's let a couple days go by.

30:57.190 --> 31:00.019
I know you want this over with,
but who knows,

31:00.062 --> 31:02.587
maybe by the time
we're back in court,

31:02.630 --> 31:05.372
we'll find out who ordered
the hit on your brother,

31:05.416 --> 31:07.853
and none of this
will be an issue.

31:07.896 --> 31:10.856
Your Honor, the defense would like to call

31:10.899 --> 31:12.988
Yuri Pasternak to the stand.

31:14.033 --> 31:15.817
You found a witness?

31:15.861 --> 31:18.385
I didn't. My staff did.

31:18.429 --> 31:20.082
So Mr. Pasternak,

31:20.126 --> 31:23.129
will you please tell the court
what it is you do for a living?

31:23.172 --> 31:25.566
I deliver food.
Food from restaurants.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.786
People order it on an app
on their phones,

31:27.829 --> 31:29.396
and I bring it to them.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.138
And on the night that
Judge Stanley's throat was slit,

31:32.181 --> 31:33.574
you were there.

31:33.618 --> 31:35.359
You were making a delivery?

31:35.402 --> 31:38.275
Yeah. I just finished
dropping off some vegan food

31:38.318 --> 31:40.407
to an apartment down the street.

31:40.451 --> 31:42.844
Vegan? You remember that.

31:42.888 --> 31:45.673
Uh, you always remember
the bad tippers.

31:45.717 --> 31:46.892
Ah.
- Plus,

31:46.935 --> 31:48.850
all the stuff
that happened after.

31:48.894 --> 31:51.288
And can you tell us
what happened after?

31:51.331 --> 31:55.596
After I dropped off the food,
I was walking back to my bike,

31:55.640 --> 31:59.600
and I could see this guy running
with a mask on his face.

31:59.644 --> 32:01.123
Uh, he was running

32:01.167 --> 32:03.125
towards the silver car.

32:03.169 --> 32:05.519
And at the same time,
I could hear some guy scream,

32:05.563 --> 32:06.868
like he'd been hurt.

32:06.912 --> 32:08.435
But you couldn't see him.

32:08.479 --> 32:11.003
Not from where I was,
but I could see the guy

32:11.046 --> 32:14.223
that was running towards
the silver car take his mask off

32:14.267 --> 32:16.791
and open the door and jump in,
and in a second,

32:16.835 --> 32:19.185
they sped past me
and down the street.

32:19.228 --> 32:22.319
And how close were you
to the car when it passed you?

32:24.364 --> 32:26.148
Probably as close
as I am to you.

32:26.192 --> 32:28.629
About 12 feet away?
Yeah, that sounds right.

32:28.673 --> 32:30.762
And could you see anything

32:30.805 --> 32:32.459
inside the vehicle
when it passed you?

32:32.503 --> 32:35.201
Yeah. I could see
the running guy

32:35.244 --> 32:37.682
holding a gun
to the driver's head.

32:37.725 --> 32:39.336
To that guy's head.

32:43.078 --> 32:44.404
Tell me what you're
seeing, Marissa.

32:44.428 --> 32:46.647
Well, I'm not seeing much, Bull.

32:46.691 --> 32:50.651
What're you talking about?
How many did we win?

32:50.695 --> 32:52.174
We didn't win any.

32:52.218 --> 32:53.828
And the few that we had,

32:53.872 --> 32:55.700
they just went away.

32:55.743 --> 32:59.007
We lost them.
We've lost them all.

32:59.051 --> 33:01.314
We even found an eyewitness.

33:01.358 --> 33:04.796
A man who actually saw Brendan
put a gun to Connor's head,

33:04.839 --> 33:06.667
but it doesn't matter.

33:06.711 --> 33:08.887
The damage is done.

33:08.930 --> 33:11.019
The jury is convinced that,

33:11.063 --> 33:12.804
not only did he
help kill the judge,

33:12.847 --> 33:15.067
but he had a hand
in killing his own brother.

33:15.110 --> 33:18.723
It's because they
don't know Connor.

33:18.766 --> 33:21.334
It's just not in him.

33:21.378 --> 33:24.685
If you're gonna drive
a killer's getaway car,

33:24.729 --> 33:27.427
if you're gonna
order a hit on someone,

33:27.471 --> 33:30.212
you got to be wired
in a certain way.

33:30.256 --> 33:32.301
It's not about your last name.

33:32.345 --> 33:36.044
Are you wired to do it?

33:36.088 --> 33:38.960
And very few people
have that kind of wiring.

33:39.004 --> 33:42.573
I know. Very few.

33:42.616 --> 33:44.009
Precious few.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.404
Anyone spring to mind?

33:50.450 --> 33:53.322
You think it was me?

33:53.366 --> 33:55.499
That I killed my own child?

33:59.503 --> 34:01.200
Why would I do that?

34:01.243 --> 34:04.072
He betrayed your family.

34:04.116 --> 34:07.249
Turned state's evidence
on his own brother.

34:07.293 --> 34:10.905
I've always heard that people
in your line of work

34:10.949 --> 34:13.081
take enormous exception
to things like that.

34:18.870 --> 34:22.090
It made me sad,

34:22.134 --> 34:24.092
not vengeful.

34:24.136 --> 34:27.400
And his death...

34:27.444 --> 34:30.447
his death means that
everything I've built,

34:30.489 --> 34:33.362
everything I've fought for,

34:33.406 --> 34:35.408
I did for nothing.

34:37.802 --> 34:40.282
Who's gonna run it?

34:40.326 --> 34:43.242
Who's gonna watch over it?
My wife?

34:43.284 --> 34:45.549
Connor?

34:47.594 --> 34:49.900
Why would I kill

34:49.944 --> 34:51.946
the only person...

34:54.340 --> 34:55.907
with any interest

34:55.949 --> 34:58.518
in keeping my name alive?

35:00.825 --> 35:02.957
You're right.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.394
It makes no sense.

35:07.832 --> 35:10.138
It's okay.

35:10.182 --> 35:12.489
I'm making my peace with it,

35:12.532 --> 35:15.100
all of it.

35:15.143 --> 35:17.972
I'll probably spend the rest of
my life behind bars,

35:18.016 --> 35:19.800
and my name,

35:19.844 --> 35:22.411
the McCandless name,

35:22.455 --> 35:24.457
and everything it meant...

35:27.852 --> 35:30.376
will soon be forgotten.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.990
You know, that doesn't
have to be the case.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.383
You still have a son.

35:39.603 --> 35:41.953
And believe it or not,
I think there is something

35:41.996 --> 35:45.391
you can do to save
your legacy, your name.

35:47.306 --> 35:49.221
Save your blood.

35:56.271 --> 35:58.230
I loved my sons,

35:58.273 --> 35:59.666
both my sons,

35:59.710 --> 36:02.539
but Brendan...
I'd look in his eyes,

36:02.582 --> 36:05.193
I'd see myself.

36:05.237 --> 36:09.371
I'd hear his thoughts,
I'd hear myself.

36:09.415 --> 36:11.896
I loved that boy
more than anything,

36:11.939 --> 36:14.202
and he loved me.

36:14.246 --> 36:15.856
He'd do anything for me.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.817
The death of Judge Stanley
caused a mistrial

36:19.860 --> 36:21.645
in your own criminal case,
didn't it?

36:21.688 --> 36:24.517
Yes, it did.

36:24.561 --> 36:28.956
Would it be fair to say that
no one has benefited more

36:29.000 --> 36:30.479
from the judge's death than you?

36:30.523 --> 36:33.961
It was certainly fortuitous.

36:34.005 --> 36:36.660
Mr. McCandless,

36:36.703 --> 36:40.577
did you order the murder
of Judge Weston Stanley?

36:44.842 --> 36:46.713
I never said the words,

36:46.757 --> 36:49.716
but as I mentioned before,
we understood each other.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.066
The two of us knew
what the other wanted.

36:52.110 --> 36:54.721
Needed.

36:54.765 --> 36:58.072
He did what I needed him to do.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.295
Now I realize

37:01.879 --> 37:04.491
you didn't directly
tell him to do this,

37:04.534 --> 37:06.928
but at some point, did he

37:06.971 --> 37:08.669
communicate
his intentions to you?

37:08.712 --> 37:10.801
Did he share his plans with you?

37:10.845 --> 37:13.413
He would speak, I would listen,

37:13.456 --> 37:16.155
but I never told him what to do.

37:16.198 --> 37:18.809
It wasn't a conversation.

37:18.853 --> 37:22.204
He would talk,

37:22.248 --> 37:24.511
I would listen
to what he had to say.

37:24.554 --> 37:26.991
And when you were listening,

37:27.035 --> 37:28.732
did he ever mention Connor?

37:28.776 --> 37:30.473
Was he ever in the plans?

37:32.519 --> 37:34.477
Your children,

37:34.521 --> 37:36.740
they each get different parts.

37:36.784 --> 37:40.048
Different parts of you,
different parts of their mother.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.704
Connor...

37:43.747 --> 37:46.097
And I say this with love...

37:46.141 --> 37:48.839
Got all the best parts
of his mother,

37:48.883 --> 37:52.016
Objection.

37:52.060 --> 37:54.845
Can the witness please
just answer the question?

37:54.889 --> 37:57.761
Sustained. Witness
will answer the question.

37:57.805 --> 37:59.894
No.

37:59.937 --> 38:02.853
Connor was never
part of Brendan's plan.

38:02.897 --> 38:04.681
He never would be.

38:04.725 --> 38:07.162
Boy doesn't have a violent bone
in his body.

38:07.206 --> 38:09.773
He has no appetite for it,

38:09.817 --> 38:12.472
no appetite for mayhem

38:12.515 --> 38:15.083
of any kind.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.954
Bothered me for a long time.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.393
Now...

38:22.438 --> 38:26.268
He's studying to be a doctor.

38:26.312 --> 38:28.575
Makes me very proud.

38:28.618 --> 38:32.535
Baffles me,
but makes me very proud.

38:32.579 --> 38:35.843
And what about the
death of your son Brendan?

38:35.886 --> 38:39.368
The son you said you
understood the best.

38:39.412 --> 38:42.328
Any chance Connor might've
been involved in that?

38:42.371 --> 38:45.548
Objection!
Calls for speculation.

38:45.592 --> 38:48.116
My apologies, Your Honor.
I withdraw the question.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.553
Connor loved his brother.

38:50.597 --> 38:52.512
The witness
will refrain from answering.

38:52.555 --> 38:54.905
The prosecution's objection
has been sustained.

38:54.949 --> 38:58.126
That boy wouldn't kill a roach.
That boy couldn't kill a roach.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.084
This is my
final warning, Mr. McCandless.

39:00.128 --> 39:01.975
If you utter another word,
I will have you removed

39:01.999 --> 39:05.046
from this courtroom. The kid loved
his brother almost as much as I did.

39:05.089 --> 39:07.353
Marshal, I want this witness
removed from the courtroom

39:07.396 --> 39:08.789
and taken back to his cell.

39:12.749 --> 39:14.751
I don't know who killed Brendan,

39:14.795 --> 39:16.362
but it sure as hell
wasn't Connor.

39:16.405 --> 39:17.624
The jury will disregard

39:17.667 --> 39:19.103
this witness's testimony.

39:19.147 --> 39:21.367
And all of the witness's
testimony is hereby

39:21.410 --> 39:22.716
stricken from the record.

39:28.112 --> 39:30.289
In the matter of
The United States

39:30.332 --> 39:32.987
v. Connor McCandless,
we, the jury,

39:33.030 --> 39:34.815
find the defendant

39:34.858 --> 39:36.120
not guilty.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.003
I can't believe this.

39:49.046 --> 39:50.396
Believe it.

39:52.398 --> 39:55.009
Now go live your life.

40:13.723 --> 40:15.682
Dr. Bull?

40:15.725 --> 40:17.684
To what do I owe the pleasure?

40:19.163 --> 40:21.688
Your husband got it wrong on the
stand the other day, didn't he?

40:23.385 --> 40:25.561
Connor didn't get
the best parts of you,

40:25.605 --> 40:28.608
he didn't get
the best parts of him.

40:28.651 --> 40:30.523
He's very much his own man.

40:30.566 --> 40:33.787
I'm not sure I'm following you.

40:33.830 --> 40:37.007
From the beginning,
I told anyone who would listen,

40:37.051 --> 40:38.835
you're a force.

40:38.879 --> 40:41.055
And I was right.

40:41.098 --> 40:44.363
It was you that had Brendan
killed, wasn't it?

40:44.406 --> 40:47.366
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:47.409 --> 40:49.672
Ah.

40:49.716 --> 40:51.935
What I do know...

40:51.979 --> 40:54.851
is that Connor's
a very special boy.

40:54.895 --> 40:56.418
He's not like his father,

40:56.462 --> 40:59.160
not like his brother.

40:59.203 --> 41:00.683
You know, when I first sent him

41:00.727 --> 41:03.207
to stop Brendan
from killing that judge,

41:03.251 --> 41:05.862
it was because
I was sure my husband

41:05.906 --> 41:08.430
was about to go
to prison for life,

41:08.474 --> 41:12.347
and that would've been the
answer to so many of my prayers.

41:12.391 --> 41:14.523
But sometimes

41:14.567 --> 41:18.048
things don't work out
the way you plan.

41:18.092 --> 41:19.833
They just don't.

41:19.876 --> 41:22.226
The key is to have faith,

41:22.270 --> 41:26.056
to persevere.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.841
What was the crossword clue

41:27.884 --> 41:29.451
I couldn't get
the day we first met?

41:29.495 --> 41:30.800
The one you helped me with?

41:30.844 --> 41:34.064
It was a-a ten letter word

41:34.108 --> 41:36.458
for the guardianship and control

41:36.502 --> 41:39.766
exercised by the Lord our God.

41:39.809 --> 41:41.463
Providence.

41:41.507 --> 41:45.032
Providence.

41:45.075 --> 41:49.253
We have to have faith
in providence,

41:49.297 --> 41:52.387
even if it costs us our husband,

41:52.431 --> 41:54.824
even if it costs us
our firstborn.

41:54.868 --> 41:57.087
By the way,

41:57.131 --> 41:58.959
I signed your check yesterday.

41:59.002 --> 42:01.570
I'm sure you'll see it
in the next day or two.

42:01.614 --> 42:03.746
Who knows,

42:03.790 --> 42:06.445
perhaps we'll have
the opportunity

42:06.488 --> 42:08.925
to work together again
at some point.

42:08.969 --> 42:11.754
I strongly doubt that.

42:11.798 --> 42:13.713
Oh, you just don't know.

42:15.715 --> 42:18.674
Providence, Dr. Bull.

42:18.718 --> 42:20.720
Providence.
