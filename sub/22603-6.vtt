WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:03.750
Where on earth have you been?!

00:03.800 --> 00:05.030
Am I your wife?

00:05.080 --> 00:06.870
~ Of course you're my wife.
~ 'Your husband,'

00:06.920 --> 00:11.350
he has sold you to me in exchange
for a piece of wood.

00:13.000 --> 00:13.990
She's dead.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.990
The corpse lying upstairs
is no longer your wife.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.030
The bargain... is done.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.390
They are very beautiful.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.310
I aim for the whole book
to be a work of beauty.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.670
What do you consider so dangerous
about this book, sir?

00:25.720 --> 00:26.750
Everything.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.790
Mr Strange's book is the
most dangerous of all.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.440
Goddamn him!

00:31.960 --> 00:33.830
No! Mr Norrell!

00:33.880 --> 00:36.150
I pleaded, sir, on any condition,

00:36.200 --> 00:38.190
that he help me bring my wife back.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.190
What was the magic?.. not tell me.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.710
Why will you not tell me?!

00:41.760 --> 00:42.830
I know!

00:42.880 --> 00:44.670
What is the matter?

00:44.720 --> 00:46.830
I have a message for you...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.520
nameless slave.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.630
I should take something of the
lady's to signify my claim.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.510
Will you pass me my little box?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.790
Excellent.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.550
I shall summon a fairy.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.030
I've tried every spell I know.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.030
That is the difficulty
- to see and hear them.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.510
Yet there was one present who
perceived him very clearly.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.150
Why could he, when I could not?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.870
~ Was this fellow a magician?
~ No, no. This man was just... mad.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.190
You cannot propose that you
purposely become a... a lunatic.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.790
Sir, open this door.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.440
'But how does one work up a
little madness in oneself?'

01:20.760 --> 01:21.960
Sir?

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.560 --> 03:02.510
Ah, good morning, good morning.
How many have we sold today?

03:02.560 --> 03:05.470
~ Ah, 60 or 70.
~ Very good.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.470
The only problem with
having a fugitive author

03:07.520 --> 03:08.990
is knowing where to send the money.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.950
A great many people have come twice
and bought a copy both times.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.430
Excellent.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.840
Some of them were not happy.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.070
Be advised by me, sirs! Do
not buy your books from here.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.950
~ They are liars and thieves.
~ I am John Murray, sir.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.630
We rob no people here.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.390
Mr Tantony and I have come all
the way from Nottinghamshire

03:29.440 --> 03:31.550
especially to buy Mr Strange's book!

03:31.600 --> 03:33.390
Then be my guest and buy one.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.150
We bought one not ten minutes ago.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.710
To replace the one we bought
not ten minutes before that!

03:38.760 --> 03:40.830
Mr Tantony put the first
one in his pocket,

03:40.880 --> 03:43.710
and before we had reached Great
Pulteney Street, it had gone!

03:45.200 --> 03:47.240
This is what I mean! Did
you see it just go pop?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.720
Oh!

03:57.640 --> 03:59.040
Ah!

04:02.040 --> 04:05.670
~ What on earth is this, sir?
~ Theft.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.470
Norrell. Norrell!

04:09.520 --> 04:11.990
He will pay for this act.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.830
He shall pay for the new edition.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.510
He shall pay for the advertisements.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.350
And that will give him greater
pain than anything else!

04:18.399 --> 04:20.510
Wait til Strange hears about this!

05:06.120 --> 05:07.480
Agh!

05:55.520 --> 06:00.350
La prego, non la disturbi.
Ella e pazza.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.350
No, signor... Signor, I must insist.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.230
We've come a long way to visit...

06:12.400 --> 06:13.600
Ah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.400
What an airy situation
you have here, ma'am.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.470
You must be able to
see all of Venice.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.990
I am Dr Greysteel.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.830
Ooh.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.430
This is my, er, daughter, Flora.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.030
Perhaps, ma'am, you remember
Mr John McKean of Aberdeenshire?

06:42.080 --> 06:45.430
He sends us to say
he hopes you are well

06:45.480 --> 06:48.760
and to pass on every good
wish for your future health.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.950
May we take back some report
to Mr McKean, ma'am?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.070
We have disturbed her.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.150
Beg your pardon, madam, for
having come unannounced.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.800
My daughter and I will
return at a later...

07:11.440 --> 07:13.070
.. at a later...

07:19.400 --> 07:20.680
.. date.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.000
Prego, signore.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.430
~ No! Impossibile, signore.
~ Mandragora. Henbane.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.230
No, no, I need more.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.150
What you gave me before was not
strong enough. Not strong...

07:34.200 --> 07:35.550
.. pazzo inglese.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.870
I am a Magician-In-Ordinary
to the British Army, sir.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.830
I'm engaged upon important research!

07:39.880 --> 07:41.760
~ Might I help?
~ I, I need...
~ No!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.640
Tell him I have money.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.070
He says these things
bring death, madness.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.360
Yes, madness is what I want.
Madness is what I want!

08:05.040 --> 08:06.910
I do not think he
wishes to serve you.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.630
My name is Flora Greysteel. This
is my father, Dr James Greysteel.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.360
Er... my name is Jonathan Strange.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.070
What is it that brings you to Venice,
Mr Strange? Army business?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.440
My wife died.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.790
Venice was always a city she
particularly longed to visit.

08:24.840 --> 08:29.390
~ Oh, Mr Strange.
~ And I am studying. Experimenting. New magic.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.950
With what object?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.630
I wish to secure myself
a fairy servant.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.390
We should be going.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.030
Conto, per favore.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.990
And working to uncover
the magic which might

08:39.039 --> 08:40.470
bring such a spirit forth.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.990
I have tried everything. None of
it with the slightest success.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.750
But are they not wicked creatures?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.670
Is it not very dangerous
to entrust yourself

08:47.720 --> 08:49.870
~ with such a disreputable companion?
~ Oh, to be sure.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.750
Fairies are naturally
full of mischief

08:51.800 --> 08:53.750
and exceedingly difficult to control.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.710
Were I to succeed, I should have to
proceed with the greatest caution.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.430
Besides, their knowledge and
power are such that a magician

08:59.480 --> 09:01.230
cannot lightly dispense
with their help.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.550
Not unless that magician
is Gilbert Norrell.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.160
What a very interesting topic.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.710
What brings you to Venice?

09:08.760 --> 09:11.670
We came to pass on greetings
to an old lady related

09:11.720 --> 09:17.030
to one of my colleagues, but sadly
we have found her indisposed.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.670
~ She is mad, poor woman.
~ Flora!

09:19.720 --> 09:24.150
~ Cats. I am sure, Mr Strange,
I saw her eat a bird.
~ Please!

09:24.200 --> 09:26.990
Perhaps you could use
your magic upon her?

09:27.040 --> 09:28.990
I do not think so.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.870
My tutor says that magic
cannot cure madness.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.550
Apparently, the Aureates found
it a magically useful condition.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.390
Well, who are we to say
that madness is a curse?

09:38.440 --> 09:41.750
For many people - poets,
for instance - it's a gift.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.190
Perhaps that's how those wild
magicians thought of it.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.600
Yes.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.590
A gift.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.040
Yes, perhaps that is
the way to think of it.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.000
Well, this has been most pleasant.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
Flora?

10:09.400 --> 10:15.110
♪ Nameless slave, you shall
be a king in a strange land

10:15.160 --> 10:17.240
♪ The rain shall make a door for me

10:18.520 --> 10:22.910
♪ Then I shall go through
it balanced on my hand

10:22.960 --> 10:25.390
♪ Nameless slave... ♪

10:26.840 --> 10:28.120
(Come here.)

10:29.640 --> 10:31.710
"The nameless slave shall
wear a silver crown."

10:31.760 --> 10:34.110
Huh? What about that?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.870
Does that make any sense to you?

10:35.920 --> 10:37.510
No man in England could be a slave.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.110
You keep telling yourself
that... Your Majesty.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.150
Where did you come by this talk?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.510
Open this door and I'll tell you.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.790
I have an important
assignation with a tree.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.830
(I am to meet someone there.)

10:50.880 --> 10:53.870
I cannot set you free. You're
imprisoned here with good reason.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.070
I have the keys to your
freedom, nameless slave.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.510
If you have the keys to mine.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.590
Come on.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.350
And what freedom can
you grant me, sir?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.750
Freedom from the fairy!

11:08.840 --> 11:12.310
He is coming! He is coming for you!

11:12.360 --> 11:14.990
Free me and I will free you.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.430
Have you heard nothing of Mr Strange?

11:19.480 --> 11:21.110
~ Nameless slave!
~ My lady...

11:21.160 --> 11:22.750
<You shall be a king
in a strange land!

11:22.800 --> 11:25.150
Mr Strange has disappeared.
He's escaped from gaol.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.990
No-one has any clue
where he may be found.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.790
Perhaps we should
write to Mr Norrell.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.150
Perhaps you might cut my throat.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.000
~ My lady...
~ I wish to go to sleep.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.520
And all you men leave me in peace.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.800
Leave!

11:57.960 --> 12:01.430
Now we hear the Johannites
have seized yet another mill

12:01.480 --> 12:03.030
in the name of their ancient king!

12:03.080 --> 12:05.030
The Raven will return, they say.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.630
No!

12:06.680 --> 12:08.430
The north will rise against us -

12:08.480 --> 12:11.310
what does the honourable member
have to say about this?

12:11.360 --> 12:16.630
After all, it was HE who ushered
magic back into our country!

12:18.280 --> 12:21.110
And he who planted these seeds
in the minds of common men!

12:21.160 --> 12:23.510
He who unleashed these...

12:23.560 --> 12:25.790
these magicians upon us.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.430
Order!

12:28.480 --> 12:31.390
One a seditionist who incites riots,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.910
implicated in the mysterious
death of his wife...

12:33.960 --> 12:35.360
No, sir!

12:36.760 --> 12:38.390
Order!

12:38.440 --> 12:42.990
And, the... And the other a thief.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.230
Order!

12:50.280 --> 12:51.990
Mr Norrell, it is beyond
the pale, sir.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.430
You have used your magic to
gain access to people's homes,

12:54.480 --> 12:56.030
to rifle through their property

12:56.080 --> 12:58.310
and to destroy every copy
of Mr Strange's book!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.070
What on earth possessed
you to do it, sir?

13:00.120 --> 13:02.790
~ Do you think I had any choice?
~ I do not know.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.470
The general opinion
is that it was done

13:04.520 --> 13:06.510
because of the squabble
with your former pupil.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.030
It was done for the country's good.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.070
Well, it has done you
very little good.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.390
And it has done me no good at all.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.760
Good morning.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.030
Where is Strange?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.550
I cannot discover it. He's not here.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.030
You are the only magician
in England now.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.800
Do you think Mr Strange would
let such an act go unanswered?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.990
~ I need to know where he is.
~ Can you not find him by magic?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.750
He does not wish to be found.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.670
Is there no gossip on the streets?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.760
Where... is Christopher Drawlight?

13:49.280 --> 13:52.440
Oh, how pleasant it is to
be here amongst old friends.

13:53.920 --> 13:59.430
And to be chatting in this way as
if no time had passed at all, and...

13:59.480 --> 14:01.230
nothing whatever had happened!

14:01.280 --> 14:03.390
We would like to know
where Strange is.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.390
If you've heard summat - spit it out.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.750
Oh, well... somebody said
he had been in Geneva.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.760
Or Italy, I do not recall exactly.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.950
Erm, the...

14:16.000 --> 14:19.150
The brother of the hat
maker in the next...

14:19.200 --> 14:21.510
.. cell...

14:21.560 --> 14:24.150
heard that Mr Strange
is acting very oddly.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.150
He takes certain powders
and preparations.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.710
Of what kind?

14:30.760 --> 14:35.350
Oh, they are all the fashion, sir,
you know, amongst the poets.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.750
The kind of thing to provoke
visions of palaces in Xanadu,

14:39.800 --> 14:43.110
or Christ stuck up
a tree, and suchlike.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.310
We want you to go after him.
Your debts will be paid.

14:46.360 --> 14:50.910
~ Find him.
~ I wish to know to whom he
speaks and of what he speaks.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.990
I wish to know what his plans are.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.070
I wish to know what magic he does.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.360
There is talk that he is
attempting to make himself mad.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.440
I do not wish to be in the
company of such a person.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.710
Mr Drawlight... I can
conjure terrors, sir,

15:09.760 --> 15:11.840
of which your mind cannot conceive.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.910
Find Mr Strange, and
stay with Mr Strange,

15:16.960 --> 15:18.910
or you will live a
very long time, sir,

15:18.960 --> 15:20.230
and every moment of your life,

15:20.280 --> 15:22.790
you will regret that you
did not do as I asked.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.520
Find him and discover
what he is doing.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.510
She seemed brighter this evening,
father. Do you not agree?

15:35.640 --> 15:37.550
I think our visits are
helping her very much.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.750
Can we not move on to Genoa?

15:38.800 --> 15:42.030
At least it will be drier and there
won't be so many art galleries.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.710
Oh...

15:43.760 --> 15:46.670
I would quite like to stay in
Venice a little longer, Papa.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.760
If I may?

15:49.320 --> 15:52.070
I see Mr Strange is a widower.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.710
~ I do not want a repeat of...
~ No, Papa.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.430
I have certainly learnt my lesson
about running off with poets.

16:08.120 --> 16:12.150
Unfortunately, my friends did not
stay to perform introductions.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.310
My name is Strange.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.150
Yours, madam, though you
do not know it, is Delgado.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.840
And I am delighted to meet you.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.120
I have a proposal for you, madam.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.310
I am able to give you
your heart's desire,

16:26.360 --> 16:29.190
and in return you shall give me mine.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.710
I must insist that you put
off your dinner for a moment

16:31.760 --> 16:34.390
and attend to what I am saying.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.360
I want you to teach me how to be mad.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.750
You question my wisdom?

16:45.800 --> 16:48.150
Now, madam, I will give
you what you wish.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.390
But, in return, you must give me
something to serve as a symbol

16:51.440 --> 16:53.470
and vessel of your
madness. Do you agree?

16:55.040 --> 16:57.760
Capital. Are you ready?

17:47.840 --> 17:51.200
(Thank you, madam. I hope
you will be very happy.)

18:01.760 --> 18:03.480
And I hope I will be, too.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.560
Well, that worked.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.990
~ Any luck?
~ I cannot find him.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.350
~ You taught him too well.
~ I did not.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.630
I failed to teach him the
most important lesson.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.080
I failed to make him see.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.760
He is too much of a
magician to stop now.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.390
~ And the magic he will do...
~ Do you recall, Mr Norrell...

18:58.440 --> 19:01.630
when you first came to London,

19:01.680 --> 19:03.630
a street magician accosted you?

19:03.680 --> 19:07.630
Yes. With tales of a... book
belonging to the Raven King.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.390
Mm-hm. And do you remember
what he said?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.070
It was nonsense.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.070
Some irrelevancies about
rain making a door,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.230
and the nameless slave shall be king,

19:17.280 --> 19:18.910
and other such Raven King gibberish.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.870
When you sent me to
get rid of him, sir,

19:21.920 --> 19:25.230
I saw the Raven's mark on my cards.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.590
They were full of them.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.670
I do wish you would throw
away those cards.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.200
They are full of ravens again.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.600
The Black Tower.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.310
Well, one thing is certain, madam.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.280
You were very mad indeed.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.360
Just a drop or two, I think.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.790
Agh!

21:28.960 --> 21:30.390
I say, do you...?

21:30.440 --> 21:32.430
You don't happen to have
a pinch of snuff on you?

21:32.480 --> 21:34.190
I seem to have mislaid my snuff box.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.830
Kendal Brown is what I generally
take, if you have it.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.550
I...

21:38.600 --> 21:41.310
Ow!

21:41.360 --> 21:42.960
I beg your pardon.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.960
Good evening.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.510
Good evening.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.590
I know this is a...

21:54.640 --> 22:01.150
an odd question, but have I...
asked you for anything yet?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.030
Snuff.

22:03.080 --> 22:07.510
~ Snuff?
~ You asked me for a pinch... of snuff.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.590
~ When?
~ What?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.670
When did I ask you
for a pinch of snuff?

22:11.720 --> 22:14.950
~ A moment ago.
~ Ah, good. Good.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.390
Well, do not trouble yourself.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.040
I do not need it now.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.470
My name is Jonathan Strange.
Perhaps you have heard of me?

22:23.520 --> 22:25.790
It was your - or one of your kind's -

22:25.840 --> 22:27.710
attentions to the King of England

22:27.760 --> 22:29.990
that first brought you to my notice.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.190
Such power, sir.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.360
English magic today lacks spirit.
It lacks fire and energy.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.270
The glimpse I had of your
magic persuaded me that

22:40.320 --> 22:42.640
it was something
altogether different.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.990
I feel we could work together.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.510
I am sure that can be arranged.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.630
I... I dare say your magical
sensibilities are...

22:53.680 --> 22:55.390
much finer than my own.

22:55.440 --> 23:02.670
My magical sensibilities are, as
you suppose, quite tremendous.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.430
And just now... they inform me

23:06.480 --> 23:11.190
that you have acquired
an object of great power.

23:11.240 --> 23:16.150
A ring of disenchantment?
An urn of visibility?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.750
Show me the object.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.520
I... I have nothing of that sort.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.070
I bought that in Turin.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.600
No, indeed.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.070
And really there does not
seem to be anything here -

23:31.120 --> 23:33.390
apart from the usual objects -

23:33.440 --> 23:36.990
that I would expect
to find in the rooms

23:37.040 --> 23:39.120
of a magician of your genius.

23:41.320 --> 23:45.190
~ You make no reply to my suggestion.
~ Suggestion?

23:45.240 --> 23:49.310
Of an alliance. You are undecided
until you know more about me.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.680
That is as it should be.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.270
In a day or two, I will do myself
the honour of soliciting

23:55.320 --> 23:57.160
your company once again...

23:58.240 --> 24:01.350
.. and discuss terms.

24:01.400 --> 24:06.510
It has been a most
interesting conversation.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.800
The first of many, I hope.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.070
Yes!

24:22.640 --> 24:23.680
Good morning!

24:24.960 --> 24:27.270
Nameless slave?

24:27.320 --> 24:31.030
♪ For always and forever,
I pray remember me

24:31.080 --> 24:36.320
♪ Whatever troubles you might have,
it's me who can set you free. ♪

24:38.360 --> 24:42.950
The magician has found some way
to perceive me. An alliance!

24:43.000 --> 24:48.910
The arrogance of it! To summon
me back and discuss terms.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.910
This stew is excellent.

24:51.960 --> 24:56.110
These English magicians
are always very stupid.

24:56.160 --> 25:02.350
The poor ones desire an unending
supply of turnips or porridge.

25:02.400 --> 25:08.590
The rich ones want more riches,
or power over the world.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.990
Have some bread.

25:10.040 --> 25:14.750
When he asks for one of those
things, I will grant it.

25:14.800 --> 25:19.470
It will bring a world
of trouble on his head.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.320
It is sure to kill him.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.110
Oh. Dropped your spoon.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.630
I, er... I must return to London.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.840
May I take a cart and...

25:35.320 --> 25:36.830
.. and some food?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.830
~ Of course.
~ Of course.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.000
Thank you.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.950
You may put your head
out. We are gone.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.840
Here... did you bring
them pies, did ya?

26:02.720 --> 26:06.710
"The nameless slave shall wear
a silver crown." His words, sir.

26:06.760 --> 26:07.800
Not mine.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.670
I do not understand how
you know such things.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.350
~ My book.
~ What is this book?

26:15.400 --> 26:19.310
The book of the Raven King,
sir. It tells me your destiny.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.310
And the destiny of the two magicians.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.830
I've told it to them, and
now I've told it to you.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.760
My task is done - almost.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.750
Now, I do hope you'll help me

26:31.800 --> 26:33.990
keep my appointment with this tree.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.670
The order of it all is about
to change, nameless slave.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.080
Oh, yes.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.990
Miss Greysteel. Sir.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.990
Er, may I borrow your daughter
for a couple of hours?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.150
Oh, well, er...

26:46.200 --> 26:49.560
Forgive me, but she is... exactly
the right size and shape.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.030
That one is very pretty.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.280
It is too billowy.
It is not the fashion.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.350
Italian fashion is
sleek and passionate.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.710
I will be guided.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.800
I'm going to see if I can
find any English newspapers.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.710
You're so bright this
morning, Mr Strange.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.040
~ I cannot but think that you have succeeded.
~ Yes.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.990
~ You have summoned a fairy?
~ I have.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.310
What was the creature like?

27:30.360 --> 27:32.510
A very odd fellow, with silvery hair.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.190
Much like ourselves, but, yes,
a very odd fellow indeed.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.710
Imagine what can be done!
You will transform England.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.350
Well, I suppose so. I had
not thought much beyond...

27:42.400 --> 27:44.200
I have not yet made the bargain.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.000
Ah - that one. That one.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.310
Will you teach me to
do magic, Mr Strange?

27:51.360 --> 27:52.950
Once it is restored?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.910
Gladly.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.150
I shall teach all the women
and all the poor men magic!

27:58.200 --> 28:01.030
I will give England
back its heritage.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.030
I shall be quite in
the mood to do it.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.990
Will you put the Raven
King back on his throne?

28:05.040 --> 28:09.710
There are some who say that the Raven
King is not a man, but an idea.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.080
That he is not one
magician, but several.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.360
You must take me dancing.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.230
I'll take this one.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.080
This concerns you, Mr Strange.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.110
He has destroyed my book.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.950
A fugitive, sir? From what?

28:30.000 --> 28:33.070
A misunderstanding. It is nothing.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.990
I shall settle it.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.160
~ Grazie. Arrivederci.
~ Arrivederci.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.160
(I hope you will like
this, Arabella.)

29:46.880 --> 29:49.190
I have been thinking
about your proposal.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.270
and I perceive it to
be an excellent plan.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.830
And to show you how sensible
I am of the honour,

29:55.880 --> 29:59.230
I will bring you anything you desire.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.790
Anything?

30:00.840 --> 30:01.880
Anything.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.350
And this would be in the manner
of a binding agreement?

30:06.400 --> 30:10.230
As I understand, you could not deny
me something once I had named it?

30:10.280 --> 30:11.990
Nor would I wish to.

30:12.040 --> 30:16.590
~ Riches, dominion over all
the world? That sort of thing?
~ Exactly.

30:16.640 --> 30:22.040
And you would only have to give
me a little token in return.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.630
Well, I do not want
any of those things.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.200
I want you to bring my
wife back from the dead.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.200
Please.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.190
That cannot be done.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.670
Yes, it can. I know that it can.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.550
There is magic in Faerie that
can bring humans back to life.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.190
~ Indeed.
~ So?

30:44.240 --> 30:47.830
But it requires...
certain circumstances.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.670
Then let us fulfil them.

30:49.720 --> 30:52.280
You do not have her corpse to hand?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.030
It is in England, but...

30:55.080 --> 30:58.070
And the lady has been dead some time?

30:58.120 --> 31:00.470
Two-and-a-half months.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.590
~ Sir...
~ I regret to tell you

31:03.640 --> 31:07.110
that it would be quite,
quite impossible for me

31:07.160 --> 31:10.190
to bring your wife
back from the dead.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.760
I am sorry.

31:14.520 --> 31:18.470
But I have... I've been working
for it all this time.

31:18.520 --> 31:22.560
I have sacrificed
a great many things.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.750
I had done it all in the
fervent hope that you...

31:27.800 --> 31:30.550
would bring my wife back to me.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.600
Oh. Well... that is a shame.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.630
I've pictured it.

31:42.680 --> 31:46.670
What it would be like
to see her again, sir.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.310
The smell of her.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.070
The image of her face in my mind -

31:51.120 --> 31:55.600
all these things that I'm beginning
to not quite remember.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.830
And every day that she
went further from me,

32:00.880 --> 32:03.110
I consoled myself with the thought

32:03.160 --> 32:05.560
that she will be close to me again.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.720
(Please...)

32:15.400 --> 32:19.550
Come. There must be something
else you desire.

32:19.600 --> 32:24.070
A kingdom of your own?
A beautiful new companion?

32:24.120 --> 32:26.030
I do not understand.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.830
There was a woman in
England - Lady Pole.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.120
Lady Pole was a different
matter entirely.

32:33.240 --> 32:39.470
Princess Pauline Borghese
is a most delightful woman.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.600
I can have her here in
the twinkling of an eye.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.480
~ Who was the last English
magician you dealt with?
~ Mmm?

32:50.680 --> 32:52.550
What did you do for him?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.670
You do not wish to know.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.040
Norrell.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.320
These matters are not important.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.150
Who was the last English
magician you dealt with?

33:03.200 --> 33:05.710
~ I do not have to tell you that.
~ What token did he give you?

33:05.760 --> 33:07.230
~ I do not...
~ Bring it to me!

33:07.280 --> 33:10.390
Bring me what you gained
from your last dealings

33:10.440 --> 33:12.350
with an English magician.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.550
No. It is worthless, utterly.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.600
A binding agreement,
I think you said?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.240
Bring it to me.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.760
Where did you come from? Show me.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.400
Good God, sir. What
are you doing here?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.470
Do you not know he hates you?

35:38.520 --> 35:40.160
Stephen?

35:44.360 --> 35:45.560
Excuse me.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.240
Beg your pardon.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.320
~ Mr Strange? You have come here to help us.
~ What?

35:56.600 --> 35:59.440
~ I am Lady Pole. You have
come here to save us.
~ Us?

36:03.160 --> 36:04.480
'Bell?

36:07.800 --> 36:09.710
This cannot be.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.030
You did not know?

36:12.080 --> 36:13.920
Am I dreaming?

36:18.480 --> 36:19.720
'Bell!

36:22.600 --> 36:23.990
'Bell, are you alive?

36:24.040 --> 36:25.910
My love.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.040
Do you wish to dance with me, sir?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.320
That would be my pleasure.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.920
~ 'Bell!
~ Hm?

36:36.880 --> 36:39.120
STOP!

36:42.960 --> 36:44.000
Leave us.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.200
Arabella!

36:50.720 --> 36:52.590
Give me back my wife.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.110
She is gone.

36:54.160 --> 36:59.120
Disenchant her! I demand that
you give me back my wife!

37:00.320 --> 37:03.910
I have already given
you what you asked for.

37:03.960 --> 37:07.400
Now I will claim what is mine.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.710
Stop!

37:22.760 --> 37:25.070
~ Yargh!
~ No! Stop!

37:37.640 --> 37:41.430
It has taken... all my strength.

37:41.480 --> 37:45.280
I have dealt him such a blow!

37:48.600 --> 37:50.230
Thank you, Stephen.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.920
What have you done?!

38:12.840 --> 38:14.750
Have you been to other lands?

38:14.800 --> 38:17.480
~ Have fun, did you?
~ Everything is lost.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.950
~ You must tell me what I should do.
~ Just accept your destiny.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.870
That is what I have been
doing. You are mad.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.990
You tricked me into giving
you your freedom

38:29.040 --> 38:31.870
by telling me you offer me
mine. You offer me nothing!

38:31.920 --> 38:34.190
Show me this book.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.160
Show me this book if there is one!

38:40.560 --> 38:44.440
My rotten, no good, bastard father...

38:46.960 --> 38:51.110
.. was stupidly entrusted to deliver
the Book of the Raven King

38:51.160 --> 38:54.230
to a man in the Derbyshire Hills,

38:54.280 --> 38:58.240
the last man in England who
could read the King's letters.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.590
Unfortunately, en-route...
he got himself embroiled

39:04.640 --> 39:08.590
in a drinking competition with
a blacksmith in Sheffield,

39:08.640 --> 39:12.830
and when challenged proceeded
to eat the book.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.280
Four years later, I was born...

39:18.480 --> 39:22.110
.. with it written all
over my infant body.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.750
You... are the Book
of the Raven King!

39:30.640 --> 39:33.640
I was born with this, just
like you was born with that.

39:36.160 --> 39:39.910
Now, meaning is written on
our skin, nameless slave.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.270
Indeed.

39:41.320 --> 39:44.270
My skin means that any man may
strike me in a public place

39:44.320 --> 39:46.470
and never fear the consequence.

39:46.520 --> 39:50.150
It means no matter
how many books I read,

39:50.200 --> 39:53.310
how many languages I master,

39:53.360 --> 39:56.590
no matter how diligently I work,

39:56.640 --> 40:00.350
I will never be anything
but a curiosity.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.600
It means... that I am nothing.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.230
Nothing.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.360
And my skin means the
opposite of yours.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.030
My skin means that you shall be
raised up on high, nameless slave.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.510
It means that your kingdom
is waiting for you

40:19.560 --> 40:22.110
and that your enemy
shall be destroyed.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.160
It means...

40:25.640 --> 40:27.590
.. that the time has almost come.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.830
Let's go for a stroll...

40:34.880 --> 40:37.080
and find my tree.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.230
'Mr Strange is in Venice.'

40:42.280 --> 40:44.590
Drawlight met a party on
their way back to England

40:44.640 --> 40:46.150
who said they'd seen him there.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.030
Well, do we know what
he's doing there?

40:48.080 --> 40:51.190
Er... he's spending a great deal
of time in the company of a family

40:51.240 --> 40:54.430
by the name of
Greyfield... Greystone.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.110
He's fallen in love
with the daughter.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.550
She is a disgraced young person
who followed Lord Byron to Italy

41:00.600 --> 41:03.990
~ and had to be rescued by her father.
~ What does it say of his magic?

41:04.040 --> 41:07.710
He's been heard saying he plans
to trap himself a fairy,

41:07.760 --> 41:11.710
and to return to England with
it to confound Mr Norrell

41:11.760 --> 41:14.230
and restore magic to
its rightful place.

41:14.280 --> 41:18.120
~ Well, can he do it? Can he do that magic?
~ I do not know.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.910
I do not know what Mr
Strange is capable of.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.640
I hope he's had the sense to
listen to what I told him.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.160
We must... leave London.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.920
It is necessary for
me to be at Hurtfew.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.000
I need my books.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.480
I need all my books.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.790
Is that...? Is that Venice?

41:52.840 --> 41:55.550
What does this mean?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.520
This is all my doing.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.110
It's all my doing.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.950
We must pack our bags at once.
Mr Strange has gone mad.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.230
They say... he's cursed the city.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.080
Flora!

43:44.360 --> 43:46.000
Mr Strange?

43:49.840 --> 43:51.480
Jonathan?

43:52.720 --> 43:54.680
Jonathan?

44:09.280 --> 44:11.000
My wife is alive...

44:12.440 --> 44:14.320
.. yet not alive.

44:15.880 --> 44:19.150
Not dead... enchanted.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.070
This is what they do.

44:21.120 --> 44:24.720
They steal those we love
and trap them away forever.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.910
I've betrayed her.

44:28.960 --> 44:32.030
I should have seen it. I should
have known what Norrell had done.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.430
What are you doing here?
Get away from here.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.430
You are in danger!

44:36.480 --> 44:39.590
~ From whom? You?
~ Norrell was right.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.670
He lied and yet he told the truth.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.600
These things are dangerous
and beyond our control.

44:45.720 --> 44:48.710
You understand? You must go.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.390
They spy on me, the
fairy and the butler.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.750
They will see you and take
you. You must go! Get out!

44:53.800 --> 44:56.510
Get out of here! Get out!

44:56.560 --> 44:58.990
I have work to do. I'm cursed!

44:59.040 --> 45:01.390
What is this that surrounds you?

45:01.440 --> 45:02.910
It is the fairy's curse.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.350
He has imprisoned me in
a tower of Eternal Night.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.470
Where I go, it goes. It is
drawing the life from me.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.590
I cannot by any means escape.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.320
Can I not help you?

45:13.960 --> 45:15.510
Perhaps.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.390
But not now.

45:17.440 --> 45:20.470
When the time is right,
you will know.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.070
Now you must leave.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.910
Be safe.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.230
Mr Strange, this is killing you!

45:28.280 --> 45:30.750
Go. Get out of here! Go!

45:30.800 --> 45:33.670
Flora. Stand back, sir.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.640
We are leaving.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.990
~ I must save my wife.
~ (Come, Flora.)

45:39.040 --> 45:41.320
Why was I made a magician
if not for this?

45:52.080 --> 45:54.430
Sir! Miss! What have you learnt?

45:54.480 --> 45:57.110
Is it true that he has
turned people into glass

45:57.160 --> 45:58.710
and thrown stones at them?

45:58.760 --> 46:01.790
Young lady, you are
his... special friend.

46:01.840 --> 46:05.630
~ What is he about in there?
~ Do you wish to be shot?

46:05.680 --> 46:08.680
~ No.
~ Then behave differently.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.510
This may be to our benefit.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.270
If this creature has imprisoned him,

46:26.320 --> 46:28.030
then he will be unable
to do his magic.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.470
~ And our next concern is to get to Hurtfew...
~ Creature?

46:30.520 --> 46:32.670
The fairy spirit.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.510
~ You believe it?
~ Of course I believe it.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.390
It is ridiculous.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.030
Fairies?!

46:41.680 --> 46:44.110
What are you doing
here, Mr Lascelles?

46:44.160 --> 46:46.440
Have you listened to nothing
I've ever told you?

46:48.560 --> 46:50.880
Sorry.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.950
~ Have you heard it?
~ What?
~ The mirrors.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
If one requires the presence
of a servant, sir, one rings!

47:36.080 --> 47:38.990
There. Listen.

47:39.040 --> 47:42.950
I know it is often thought sense to give the
servants a degree of latitude, sir, but...

47:43.000 --> 47:45.320
All the mirrors in the
house are the same.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.550
Then they must be smashed.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.110
No, no, no, no! On no account
must you do that!

47:56.520 --> 47:59.520
Forgive me, sir, Lord Liverpool
and Sir Walter Pole are here.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.560
Are you leaving us, Mr Norrell?

48:09.760 --> 48:12.800
Do not tell me you are
not leaving Venice, Flora.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.990
You will tear my heart in pieces

48:17.040 --> 48:21.630
going after these
dangerous... dangerous men!

48:21.680 --> 48:24.590
You do not know what
they are capable of.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.480
I beg you, pack your...

48:28.080 --> 48:29.640
What is that?

48:31.360 --> 48:33.560
It is from Mr Strange.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.590
'Drawlight

48:46.640 --> 48:48.390
'Drawlight.'

48:54.880 --> 48:57.600
'I see you.'

48:58.640 --> 49:00.790
'Come here.'

49:00.840 --> 49:02.630
'Now!'

49:17.640 --> 49:19.680
There it is, nameless slave.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.320
There.

49:24.960 --> 49:28.030
This is where we shall meet
our destinies, nameless slave.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.590
It does not look a place
of pleasant destinies.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.150
Nevertheless, I have
it on good authority

49:36.200 --> 49:38.760
~ there shall be a meeting here.
~ Who are we to meet?

49:39.880 --> 49:42.150
Is it he who intends I to be king?

49:42.200 --> 49:44.240
We shall know soon enough.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.990
(He's coming.)

49:50.040 --> 49:51.910
He's coming!

49:54.520 --> 49:56.110
'One thing is clear, Mr Norrell,'

49:56.160 --> 49:59.110
Great Britain already has a mad king,

49:59.160 --> 50:02.630
a mad magician is the
outside of enough.

50:02.680 --> 50:07.110
You have repeatedly asked for
commissions, sir. Well, here is one.

50:07.160 --> 50:12.070
Stop your pupil in any
way you find appropriate.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.070
~ Do not you dictate terms to me.
~ I beg your pardon?

50:15.120 --> 50:18.910
I've warned you of the dangers
disrespectable magic can pose.

50:18.960 --> 50:22.110
I told you Strange should be tamed.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.390
But you encouraged him
and you ignored me.

50:25.680 --> 50:28.670
What is that sound?
What does it mean?

50:28.720 --> 50:32.550
It means he has trafficked with creatures
that are the enemies of Great Britain,

50:32.600 --> 50:35.510
of Christianity, of mankind itself.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.480
It means wicked... mad magic.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.750
It means...

50:44.800 --> 50:46.950
catastrophe!

50:47.000 --> 50:51.470
You are the only magician in
England. You are OUR magician.

50:51.520 --> 50:54.990
We will not disregard
your advice again.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.390
You must do something to stop him!

50:58.960 --> 51:01.560
I'm not entirely sure I can.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.960
Hello?

51:30.800 --> 51:32.670
Excuse... me.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.870
Perdone.

51:39.320 --> 51:42.270
Abracadabra!

51:47.280 --> 51:50.590
Why do you spy upon me?

51:50.640 --> 51:52.880
What have I ever done that is secret?

51:54.280 --> 51:55.760
Mr Strange...

51:56.960 --> 52:01.230
Jonathan, I have always
been your friend.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.710
They made me do it.

52:03.760 --> 52:08.430
Lascelles and Norrell are...
are afraid of you, sir.

52:08.480 --> 52:10.430
They would do well to be afraid.

52:10.480 --> 52:13.710
I have been mad. Did they
tell you that? It is true.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.750
But I have learnt many
things in the darkness,

52:15.800 --> 52:18.760
and one of them is this
- I cannot do this alone.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.630
I've brought you here to help me.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.280
Oh, good.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.830
♪ The Raven King knows all too well

52:30.880 --> 52:33.550
♪ Which are the fairest flowers. ♪

52:33.600 --> 52:35.710
~ Did you feel it?
~ Feel what, sir?

52:35.760 --> 52:37.630
All the doors shook.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.870
Someone is trying to open them.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.040
~ Come, Stephen.
~ The magic of Englishmen, fairy.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
The magic of Englishmen
is coming back.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.680
~ Who is this?
~ What did I tell you, nameless slave?

52:55.240 --> 52:58.310
Destiny. Didn't I tell you
the hour had almost come?

52:58.360 --> 53:01.150
What in the world do you
think you are talking about,

53:01.200 --> 53:02.630
you ridiculous creature?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.950
~ What on earth do you do with him?
~ I tell him his fortune.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.950
I tell him that he will be king.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.870
That he will be free from you.

53:09.920 --> 53:14.830
And how did you come by this
fortune, little pig-person?

53:17.720 --> 53:19.510
My book!

53:19.560 --> 53:23.270
Englishmen and their books.

53:23.320 --> 53:27.550
Perhaps you had been better
advised to sell your book

53:27.600 --> 53:30.030
and buy a nicer coat.

53:33.080 --> 53:34.990
This is John Uskglass's book, fairy,

53:35.040 --> 53:37.160
and it tells the fortunes of us all.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.190
And what is your fortune?

53:40.240 --> 53:42.750
I dunno, but it's better than yours.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.720
I doubt the truth of that.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.190
He has been most
impertinent, Stephen.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.670
And he is very ugly indeed.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.150
Let us kill him.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.870
Oh, no! Sir, please!

53:55.920 --> 53:58.280
No!

54:03.280 --> 54:05.510
Try what you like, fairy.

54:05.560 --> 54:08.510
You will discover I
am very hard to kill.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.950
~ Are you indeed?
~ Hmm.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.630
For I must confess
that it looks to me

54:13.680 --> 54:16.910
as if nothing would be easier.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.840
Do you dance, rogue?

54:25.640 --> 54:28.350
Lady Pole is not mad.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.750
She appears mad but that
is Norrell's fault.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.990
He summoned a fairy spirit
to raise her from the dead

54:33.040 --> 54:35.390
and in exchange he gave it
all sorts of rights over her.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.870
This same creature has threatened
the liberty of the King of England

54:38.920 --> 54:42.070
and has enchanted at least two
more of His Majesty's subjects,

54:42.120 --> 54:44.000
one of them my wife.

54:45.760 --> 54:49.720
Your first job is to tell John
Childermass what I have just
told you and to give him this.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.150
It contains a gift for Lady
Pole and my instructions.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.310
He must not give it to her
before I send the word.

54:56.360 --> 54:59.350
~ Not before then, do you understand?
~ Perfectly.

54:59.400 --> 55:01.710
I'm opening the doors.

55:01.760 --> 55:04.280
I'm returning magic to England.

55:06.040 --> 55:09.550
Your second task is to get this
letter directly to Lady Pole.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.240
Of course.

55:16.880 --> 55:21.950
~ When you say you are returning magic to...
~ It's easier than I thought.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.990
All of the Raven King's old
alliances are still in place.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.190
These birds are my messengers...

55:29.240 --> 55:31.750
.. sent to remind the stones
and the sky and the rain

55:31.800 --> 55:33.550
of their ancient promises.

55:33.600 --> 55:37.720
I am flinging open the doors
and allowing magic back in.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.240
The world will be changed,
Mr Drawlight.

55:42.360 --> 55:44.630
And if you do not do as I say,

55:44.680 --> 55:47.670
all the magicians in England
will rise up and destroy you.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.750
Do you understand me?

55:49.800 --> 55:52.470
I... I thought there was only one.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.990
N-N-Now that you are here,

55:55.040 --> 55:57.710
I thought there was only
one magician in England.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.350
Perhaps I... I was mistaken.

56:00.400 --> 56:04.040
All the men and women who ever wanted
to be Norrell's pupils are magicians.

56:05.160 --> 56:08.910
John Childermass is another.
Segundus another.

56:08.960 --> 56:11.880
Honeyfoot. The members
of the old societies.

56:12.840 --> 56:14.950
England is full of magicians.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.910
Norrell silenced them, but they
are magicians nonetheless.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.470
Deliver these three messages and
I shall take no revenge upon you.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.150
I shall not harm you.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.950
Oh, thank you!

56:27.000 --> 56:29.040
Thank you!

56:32.280 --> 56:34.150
Er...

56:34.200 --> 56:36.990
Three? Erm... Mr Strange, I...

56:37.040 --> 56:39.550
You have only... only given me two.

56:39.600 --> 56:42.630
Three messages. You must
deliver three messages.

56:42.680 --> 56:47.630
Yes, but... but what
is the third? I...

56:47.680 --> 56:49.720
Tell Norrell...

56:51.680 --> 56:53.550
.. I am coming.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.190
He told me I would be free.

57:54.240 --> 57:57.790
~ He told me I would be king.
~ Of course you will, dear Stephen.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.430
He has it written all over him.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.310
What more does it say?

58:02.360 --> 58:05.960
It says... the magicians will fail.

58:06.880 --> 58:09.350
It's a very old prophecy.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.440
Come, Stephen, it is no matter.

58:13.640 --> 58:16.470
Let us return... to the dance.
