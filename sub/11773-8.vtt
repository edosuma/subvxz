AUNTIE RAE, AUNTIE RAE?

00:17.200 --> 00:20.633

I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.133
OH, ALL RIGHT THEN.
WHAT IS IT?

00:22.167 --> 00:24.267
EH, DON'T WORRY.

YOU LOVE GARDENING,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.733
AND HOW YOU WISH YOU
COULD GARDEN HERE,

00:29.767 --> 00:33.133
SO I CLEARED THIS
LITTLE AREA FOR YOU.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.533

00:34.567 --> 00:36.300
YOU DID THIS FOR ME?

00:36.333 --> 00:38.633

- OH, LARRY!

00:38.667 --> 00:40.567

00:43.167 --> 00:46.067
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE THIS.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.633

I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT, LARRY!

00:53.500 --> 00:55.833
THANK YOU, LARRY.
I--

00:58.567 --> 01:02.133
LARRY,
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

01:02.167 --> 01:03.733
AH!

01:09.500 --> 01:12.467
Larry:
SHE CALLED ME DISGUSTING.
( laughs )

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
OH MY GOD.

01:15.933 --> 01:19.100
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
- AND SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE.

01:19.133 --> 01:21.067
- OH MY GOD.
- HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU?

01:21.067 --> 01:24.067
YOU KNOW, SHE WENT
OVER THE APPROPRIATE
AMOUNT OF TIME

01:24.067 --> 01:27.067
THAT I CAN HAVE
HUMAN CONTACT
WITHOUT GETTING AROUSED.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.100
I ONLY HAVE FIVE SECONDS.

01:29.133 --> 01:31.167
AFTER THAT, IT'S OUT
OF MY CONTROL.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.433
NOT ME. I'VE GOT
DISCIPLINE DOWN THERE.
I HAVE A VERY DISCERNING PENIS.

01:34.467 --> 01:35.800
- NO...
- VERY DISCERNING.

01:35.833 --> 01:38.067
- MY PENIS IS AN ANIMAL.
- REALLY, JUST OUT OF CONTROL?

01:38.067 --> 01:40.367
- IT'S A FERAL TIGER, YEAH.
- IT'S WILD.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.933
OH, SO HOW'D YOUR--
HOW'D THE APPOINTMENT GO?
WITH THE DOCTOR?

01:42.967 --> 01:44.633

01:44.667 --> 01:47.400
HE'S GONNA SNIP-SNIP,
AND...

01:47.433 --> 01:49.700
I WILL NO LONGER
BE SNORING.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.800
- REALLY?
- GOING IN ON
THURSDAY MORNING.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.633
- FANTASTIC.
- UNBELIEVABLE!

01:53.667 --> 01:56.233
- FANTASTIC.
- MY DOG HOWLS

01:56.267 --> 01:58.400
FROM MY SNORING.
I WAKE UP MY DOG.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.900
MY DOG STARTS HOWLING.
I'M OUT OF CONTROL.

02:00.933 --> 02:02.700
- THIS'LL BE GOOD.
- THIS'LL BE GREAT.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.233
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.
- IT IS ABOUT TIME.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.933
- YEAH.

02:05.967 --> 02:09.533
HEY, GUESS WHAT ELSE?
I THINK BEN STILLER'S GONNA
COME WITH ME AS A CLIENT.

02:09.567 --> 02:11.367
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NO!

02:11.400 --> 02:14.400
- HAVE YOU MET WITH HIM?
- NO, I'M MEETING WITH HIM
THIS WEEK.

02:14.433 --> 02:17.967
- IF YOU COULD SIGN HIM...
- I THINK IT'S A SLAM-DUNK.
DONE DEAL.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.800
IT'S GONNA BRING YOU IN
SO MUCH INCOME.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.133
- HUGE INCOME, I KNOW.
- MY GOD.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.933

02:31.933 --> 02:33.833
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LOVE?
I'D LOVE AN ARNOLD PALMER.

02:33.867 --> 02:36.167
- OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.067
EXCUSE ME?

02:39.067 --> 02:41.567

02:47.667 --> 02:50.467
YEAH. NICE TO PEOPLE

02:50.500 --> 02:53.533
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

02:53.567 --> 02:56.467
- YEAH.
- BALD PEOPLE GET DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST CONSTANTLY.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.433
AND YOU JUST SAW
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IT.

02:58.467 --> 03:00.333
OH, IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE BALD.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.567
YEAH, ASK ANY BALD PERSON.
ASK, GO AHEAD.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.433
YOU STILL HAVE ISSUES
WITH BEING BALD.

03:04.467 --> 03:07.767
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE BALD--
IF I WOKE UP TOMORROW
AND I FOUND MYSELF BALD,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.733
I'D BE SO COOL WITH IT.
IT'D BE NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S ALL NATURAL.

03:10.767 --> 03:13.067
- YEAH, RIGHT,
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.
- WHATEVER.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.167
HEY, THEY HAVE
A PHARMACY HERE, RIGHT?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.367

THEN I'LL PICK IT UP

03:49.133 --> 03:51.400
I COULD HAVE SWORN

03:51.433 --> 03:54.267
I HAD ABOUT TWICE
AS MANY FRENCH FRIES

03:54.300 --> 03:56.767

03:56.800 --> 03:59.700

03:59.733 --> 04:01.067
- HUH?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.900

04:08.400 --> 04:11.267
- NO IDEA?
- I TOLD YOU I HAD NO IDEA!
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

04:11.300 --> 04:14.467

- MAYBE SOMEBODY COULD SHED
SOME LIGHT ON THIS FOR US.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.367
EXCUSE ME. HI,
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.067
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I'M WONDERING IF YOU
NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL

04:21.067 --> 04:23.400
GOING ON AT THIS TABLE
AFTER I LEFT?

04:23.433 --> 04:26.633
WELL, I--
I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.
I DON'T WANT

04:26.667 --> 04:28.467
TO IMPINGE
ON A FRIENDSHIP.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.067
IMPINGE AWAY.
GO AHEAD AND IMPINGE.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.400
I TOOK ONE.
SHOOT ME.

04:33.433 --> 04:36.067

TWO OF THEM MIGHT HAVE
BEEN STUCK TOGETHER.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.933
MM-MM-MM.
THANK YOU.

04:37.967 --> 04:40.433

04:56.500 --> 04:58.367
- OH WELL...

04:58.400 --> 05:01.067
SHE HUGGED ME
AND SHE HELD THAT HUG
FOR OVER FIVE SECONDS.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.300
- WHAT THE FUCK?
- I HAVE NO CONTROL
AFTER FIVE SECONDS.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.233
- SO YOU GOT
A FIVE-SECOND RULE?
- NOT A RULE,

05:05.267 --> 05:08.600
IT'S AN APPROXIMATE AMOUNT
OF TIME THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.800
WHAT THE FUCK,
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK?
LORETTA.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.167

DAMN MIND.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.733
- NO, I...

05:15.767 --> 05:18.333
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.
I HAVE NO CONTROL.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

05:18.367 --> 05:20.133
JUST LIKE THAT,
YOU GOT TURNED ON?

05:20.167 --> 05:22.333
NOT JUST LIKE THAT.
THAT'S A LONG TIME,

HE GOT A FIVE-SECOND RULE.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE--
BOING, IT COME OUT.

05:25.267 --> 05:28.333
- WHERE'S YOUR "MISSISSIPPI"?
YOU GOTTA PUT MISSISSIPPI IN.
- Both: MISSISSIPPI?

05:28.367 --> 05:30.833
THAT'S HOW YOU COUNT--
"ONE-MISSISSIPPI,
TWO-MISSISSIPPI,

05:30.867 --> 05:33.467
THREE-MISSISSIPPI,
FOUR-MISSISSIPPI,
FIVE-MISSISSIPPI."

05:33.500 --> 05:35.100
- THAT'S WAY TOO LONG.
- WAY TOO LONG.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.200
- YOU'RE STRETCHING IT OUT FOR--
- I'M NOT STRETCHING IT OUT.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.333
- I SHORTENED IT.
- I'M JUST SAYIN',
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

05:39.367 --> 05:41.367
- SINCE MY UNCLE
PASSED AWAY, MAN.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.567
YOU ALL OVER HER.
YOU STAB HER IN THE FUCKIN'
STOMACH, MAN.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.367
BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.667
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
IT DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
BECAUSE WE CAN GO.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.267
- WE CAN GO, MAN.
- WE CAN GO. WE CAN
GO ANYWHERE.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.100
- WHERE YOU GONNA GO?
- ANYWHERE. GET OUT
OF HERE, I KNOW THAT.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.067

05:54.100 --> 05:56.067
I'M SO STARVED FOR AFFECTION,
I GUESS THAT

05:56.067 --> 05:58.867
- ANY KIND OF CONTACT...

05:58.900 --> 06:02.367

- LATERAL, OKAY.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.300
FOR INSTANCE,
THIS IS YOUR GROIN.
JUST-- YOU JUST MASSAGE ACROSS.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.100
WATCH OUT FOR MY TESTICLES
RIGHT OVER THERE.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.233
( Dr. Flomm laughing )

09:00.600 --> 09:02.767
LARRY?

09:04.533 --> 09:07.433
WHY DON'T WE MOVE THIS
TO MY BEDROOM?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.167
SURE.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.667
GO UPSTAIRS,
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES,

09:12.700 --> 09:15.133
AND I'LL BE IN TO SEE
YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.367
OKAY.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.767
( exhales )

09:27.800 --> 09:31.067
( light jazz playing )

09:43.400 --> 09:45.567
LARRY?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.100
- HEY.
- HI.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.100
UH, LISTEN, I--
I AM SO SORRY.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.900
I-- I HATE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

09:50.933 --> 09:52.933
BUT MY BROTHER
AND SISTER JUST
CAME BACK.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.933
- THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.
- OH.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.700
AND MY BROTHER GOT
FOOD POISONING, SO THEY
CAME BACK EARLY,

09:57.733 --> 10:00.100
AND I--
I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.233
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- SO...

10:02.267 --> 10:04.467
- IT HAPPENS.
- ...WE NEED TO RESCHEDULE.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.267
WHY DON'T YOU GET DRESSED
AND I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE FOYER?

10:16.667 --> 10:18.367
I'M TELLING YOU, JEFFREY,

10:18.400 --> 10:20.500
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE DATING A DOCTOR.

10:20.533 --> 10:24.033
WE TALKED FOR 45 MINUTES
ABOUT MY GROIN INJURY.

10:24.067 --> 10:27.133
NO NO, SHE JUST
WANTS ME TO MASSAGE IT.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.300
IT'S KILLING ME TOO.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.700
UM, SO LISTEN--

10:31.733 --> 10:34.800
I'M GONNA SEE YOU LATER.
I'M GONNA STOP BY BEFORE
YOUR OPERATION.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.600
OKAY, MAN.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.667
OKAY, TAKE CARE.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.467
( groans )

10:46.500 --> 10:48.367
( gasps )

10:49.400 --> 10:51.233
( screams )

10:53.267 --> 10:55.833
OH!
AUNTIE RAE!

10:58.200 --> 10:59.867
- Larry: YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

10:59.900 --> 11:02.500
- LAST NIGHT, I KNOW
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
- YEAH?

11:02.533 --> 11:04.700
- THIS THING, YOU KNOW.
- OH, THAT THING.

11:04.733 --> 11:07.633
- AND BELIEVE ME, I RESPECT
YOUR MEDICAL JUDGMENT.
- MM-HM?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.700
- I THINK IT'S CANCER.
- ( laughs ) IT'S NOT CANCER.

11:10.733 --> 11:13.100
HUH? I'VE NEVER
HAD CANCER BEFORE
BUT I'M IMAGINING

11:13.133 --> 11:14.967
- THIS IS HOW IT FEELS LIKE.
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

11:15.067 --> 11:16.733
NO NO, IT'S NOT.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.800
( clears throat )
I'M GONNA...

11:18.833 --> 11:20.633
HEAD TO THE MEN'S ROOM.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.533
I-- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.967
I JUST... I'M A LITTLE
SHY ABOUT THIS,

11:25.067 --> 11:27.800
AND I JUST HAVE--
I JUST WROTE YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.100
- I THINK IT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
- MOI?

11:30.133 --> 11:33.200
- YEAH.
- AH. A NOTE.

11:33.233 --> 11:35.133
- OH MY GOD.
- YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.133
JUST-- JUST GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.067
- OH, EXCUSE ME?
- YEAH?

11:52.067 --> 11:53.600
- CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
- SURE.

11:53.633 --> 11:56.333
A DOCTOR WROTE ME THIS NOTE.
I CAN'T MAKE OUT
A WORD OF IT.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.900
YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY WRITE.
THEY HAVE TERRIBLE PENMANSHIP.

11:58.933 --> 12:00.633
- LOOK AT THIS.
- "LIBBY..."

12:00.667 --> 12:02.167
NO NO, LARRY.
THAT'S ME.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.867
SOMETHING...

12:04.900 --> 12:07.967
- SOMETHING "SOCKS."
- "SOCKS"?

12:08.067 --> 12:09.967
THAT'S AN "S"?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A "T".

12:10.067 --> 12:12.167
- TOX?
- TRUCK?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.700
TRUCK.
DO YOU HAVE A TRUCK?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.433
- NO, I DON'T HAVE A TRUCK.
- IT'S GOTTA BE TRUCK-- OH.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.533
- ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER, OKAY.
- I'M SORRY.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.067

12:21.067 --> 12:23.167
THANK YOU.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.300

- Man: YEAH, I'M AT
THE HOSPITAL.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.200
YEAH, I FUCKED
MY WRIST OR SOMETHING.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.067
YEAH, I WAS MOVINGA FUTON.

12:33.067 --> 12:37.067
AND I HAD TO TAKE
THE TOP BECAUSE OF
THIS 300-LB NIGGER.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.900
YEAH, EXACTLY.
I'M AT THE FUCKIN' TOP,
AND HALFWAY THROUGH,

12:40.933 --> 12:42.767
THIS NIGGER
DROPS HIS SIDE.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.100
SO NOWMY WRIST IS FUCKED.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.833
OH MY GOD.

12:52.433 --> 12:55.600
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST OVERHEARD
IN THE BATHROOM.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.933
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE JERK.

12:57.967 --> 13:01.900
THIS GUY IS
ON HIS CELL PHONE,
HE'S TALKING TO HIS FRIEND.

13:01.933 --> 13:04.367
AND HE'S UPSET
AND HE'S COMPLAINING,

13:04.400 --> 13:07.500
YOU KNOW, HE HAD
TO MOVE SOME FURNITURE.
AND HE SAYS TO HIS FRIEND,

13:07.533 --> 13:10.267
"I HURT MY HAND BECAUSE
I HAD TO TAKE THE TOP

13:10.300 --> 13:13.067
BECAUSE OF THIS
300-LB NIGGER WHO WAS--"

13:13.067 --> 13:15.467
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.800
- OH...
- WHAT DID YOU JUST FIX
YOUR MOUTH TO SAY?

13:17.833 --> 13:19.700
- NO NO--
- YOU JUST USED
THE MOST VILE WORD

13:19.733 --> 13:21.567
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
HOW DARE YOU?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.367
- NO, I WAS--
- HOW DARE-- IN FRONT OF ME?

13:23.400 --> 13:26.200
YOU ARE DESPICABLE.
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE
LIKE YOU.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.233
- I DIDN'T--
- YOU BALD SON OF A BITCH.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.800
I HAVE TO FACE THIS KIND
OF WRETCHED FOOLISHNESS.

13:30.833 --> 13:33.600
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I JUST WANT TO-- GOD!
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE LIKE--

13:33.633 --> 13:36.233
BALD?

13:36.267 --> 13:38.400
( machine beeping )

13:40.500 --> 13:44.700
I WONDER WHAT'S
KEEPING DR. PAGE?

13:44.733 --> 13:46.833
WHY HASN'T THIS PATIENT
BEEN PREPPED?

13:46.867 --> 13:48.300
HE IS PREPPED, SIR.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.167
EXCUSE ME, NURSE.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.333
- CLIPPERS!
- SIR, CLIPPERS
ARE NOT REQ--

13:53.367 --> 13:55.500
DO I HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING MYSELF?

13:55.533 --> 13:57.800
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
CLIPPERS, PLEASE.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.667
THANK YOU.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.100
( buzzing )

14:04.800 --> 14:08.200
Jeff:
OH MY GOD!
NO NO!

14:08.233 --> 14:09.967
- WHAT?

14:10.067 --> 14:11.800
LOOK AT ME!

14:11.833 --> 14:14.067

14:14.100 --> 14:17.167

- WHAT HAPPENED, NURSE?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.300
DR. PAGE ACCIDENTALLY SHAVED
MR. GREENE'S HEAD--

14:19.333 --> 14:20.900
- SHAVED MY HEAD?
- WAIT A MINUTE.

14:20.933 --> 14:22.667
- ACCIDENTALLY?
- DID HE OPERATE ON MY HEAD?

14:22.700 --> 14:24.267
NO, THE PROCEDURE
WAS CANCELED.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.900
THE OPERATION IS GOING
TO BE RESCHEDULED.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.067
- SO HE DIDN'T
HAVE THE SURGERY?
- NO.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.067
OH, YOU LOOK HORRIBLE.
JEFF!

14:31.067 --> 14:33.533
- NURSE, WOULD YOU
PLEASE EXCUSE US?
- DOCTOR, WHAT HAPPENED?

14:33.567 --> 14:36.067
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
LOOK AT HIM!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.700
MR. AND MRS. GREENE,
I AM SO SORRY.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.067
I WAS COMING TO SEE YOU
IN THE OPERATING ROOM

14:40.100 --> 14:43.633
AND I HAD JUST BEEN
VICTIMIZED BY A TERRIBLE
INCIDENT IN THE CAFETERIA.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.400
AND SO I CAME
TO THE OPERATING ROOM

14:45.433 --> 14:47.833
AND I WAS SO ANGERED
AND I WAS UPSET
AND I WAS CONFUSED,

14:47.867 --> 14:49.500
AND I MISTAKENLY
SHAVED YOUR HEAD,

14:49.533 --> 14:51.833
- FOR WHICH I'M SO SORRY.
- "MISTAKE" IS CORRECT.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.367
- YOU TOOK IT
OUT ON HIS HEAD?
- IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.533
I CAN EXPLAIN--
I'M LEAVING THE CAFETERIA,
AND I'M WALKING PAST A TABLE,

14:57.567 --> 15:00.267
AND THIS HORRIBLE MAN
USES THE MOST VILE WORD

15:00.300 --> 15:02.933
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
TO REFER TO A BLACK PERSON.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.667
AND I WENT
INTO A BLIND RAGE.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.200
AND I LEFT THERE AND I WENT
TO THE OPERATING ROOM,

15:07.233 --> 15:10.333
AND I MADE
THIS TERRIBLE MISTAKE,
FOR WHICH I'M SO SORRY.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.733
DO YOU KNOW WHO
THIS MAN WAS?

15:11.767 --> 15:13.400
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO HE WAS.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.067
HE WAS JUST
A DESPICABLE BALD MAN.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.767
- BALD?
- YE

15:17.800 --> 15:20.467
DID HE, BY ANY CHANCE,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.067
WEAR GLASSES?

15:22.067 --> 15:24.233
YES.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.500
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE WAS WEARING GLASSES.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.233
AND IT WAS AWFUL.
IT WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY
AWFUL.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.667
"S..."

15:35.700 --> 15:38.300
"SITTER"?
"SITTING"?

15:40.067 --> 15:42.067
( rapping on door )

15:43.067 --> 15:44.667
( sighs )

15:47.333 --> 15:49.067
LOOK AT HIM!

15:49.067 --> 15:50.867
- LOOK AT HIM!
- WHAT THE FUCK?

15:50.900 --> 15:52.767
- I'M BALD!
- YOU LIKE THIS LOOK?

15:52.800 --> 15:55.067
- HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL
FULL HEAD OF HAIR...
- I'M BALD!

15:55.067 --> 15:57.300
...A MANE THAT I LOVED
AND NOW HE LOOKS LIKE YOU!

15:57.333 --> 15:59.167
- LOOK AT ME!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.367
- HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
- YOU DID IT!

16:01.400 --> 16:02.900
- I DID IT?
- YOU DID IT! YES!

16:02.933 --> 16:05.700
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU TRAUMATIZED THE DOCTOR!

16:05.733 --> 16:09.967
HE DESCRIBED YOU.
HE SAID, "BALD, GLASSES."
YOU SAID SOME RACIAL SLUR

16:10.067 --> 16:11.933
AND YOU TRAUMATIZEDTHE DOCTOR.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.767
- AND HE CAME IN
ALL FLUMMOXED...
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.967
...AND SHAVED
HIS FUCKING HEAD!

16:16.067 --> 16:17.600
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING BALD!

16:17.633 --> 16:19.667
- SURE THERE IS!
- YES, THERE IS, LARRY!

16:19.700 --> 16:22.067
- LOOK AT YOU!
- YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T
CARE IF YOU WERE BALD!

16:22.067 --> 16:23.700
YEAH, IN 40 YEARS!
NOT FUCKING TODAY!

16:23.733 --> 16:25.733
BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WAS
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!

16:25.767 --> 16:27.933
- NOT OVERNIGHT!
- YOURS IS GONNA GROW BACK.
MINE ISN'T!

16:27.967 --> 16:29.667
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CURSE ON YOU!

16:29.700 --> 16:32.067
MINE'S GONNA
GROW BACK. YOURS ISN'T!
YOU DESERVE IT!

16:32.067 --> 16:33.900
Susie:
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO THAT DOCTOR?

16:33.933 --> 16:36.167
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.367
I WAS IN THE CAFETERIA.
I WAS HAVING LUNCH
WITH DR. FLOMM.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.633
OKAY? WHAT--
YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY...

16:41.667 --> 16:44.433
BY THE WAY, CAN YOU
INTERPRET THIS-- THIS NOTE?

16:44.467 --> 16:46.500
OH, NOBODY GIVES A SHIT
ABOUT YOUR NOTE!

16:46.533 --> 16:47.900
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:47.933 --> 16:50.233

18:20.100 --> 18:22.333
WELL, LOOK, I--
I THINK THAT

18:22.367 --> 18:25.633
YOU'RE LIMITING YOURSELF
BY JUST DOING COMEDIES.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.533
- RIGHT.

IN YOUR SLEEP.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.067
LET'S SHOW PEOPLE MORE.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.233
WHY CAN'T YOU WIN
AN ACADEMY AWARD?

18:31.267 --> 18:33.800

ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.433

18:43.900 --> 18:45.933
TO DEVELOP THOSE
PROJECTS WITH YOU.

18:45.967 --> 18:48.767

18:48.800 --> 18:52.100
( voice fades )
THAT ARE MORE INDEPENDENT,
SMALLER IN SCALE...

18:52.133 --> 18:55.433
AS WELL AS THE BIG-SCALE STUFF.
THAT'S GONNA FALL IN YOUR LAP.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.567
I'LL DO THE WORK.
YOU WON'T NOTICE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT

18:57.600 --> 18:59.533
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE COLLECTING AWARDS.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.400
( normal voice )OKAY?

19:01.433 --> 19:03.167

FEEL RIGHT."

19:19.533 --> 19:21.700
- "DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT"?
- DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

19:21.733 --> 19:24.067
- YEAH?

19:24.100 --> 19:26.867
YOU KNOW WHAT DOESN'T

19:26.900 --> 19:29.300
- YOU'RE BALD.
- YOU THINK THAT'S
THE REASON WHY?

19:29.333 --> 19:30.867
- YEAH.
- I'M NOT SURE.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.133
DOESN'T WANT A BALD MAN
TO BE REPRESENTING HIM!

19:33.167 --> 19:35.533
HEY! YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.567
- I'M GONNA GET--
- I'M A LITTLE BUSY TODAY.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.533

19:43.233 --> 19:44.833
- WEIRD?

19:44.867 --> 19:46.833
THAT'S THE WAY
IT WORKS, MY FRIEND.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.267
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.900

OF DOLLARS TODAY.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.300
- WHAT HAPPENED.
- MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.967
- MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
- THE HOSPITAL WANTS
TO MEET WITH ME.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.667
THEY WANT TO TALK AND--
AND GO OVER MY BILL.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.500
"GO OVER MY BILL."
I'M GONNA SUE THESE
MOTHERFUCKERS.

20:02.533 --> 20:04.800
- THAT'S IT!
THAT'S FUCKING IT!
- RIGHT, GOOD FOR YOU.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.933
THIS BLOWS.
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT?

20:06.967 --> 20:10.633
YOU JUST GET USED TO IT.
AND I GET SUPPORT
FROM MY BALD BROTHERS.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.833
- THERE'S, LIKE, MEETINGS?
- THERE'S NO MEETINGS,

20:12.867 --> 20:15.067

- WE'LL GIVE A THUMBS UP.
- YEAH.

20:17.933 --> 20:20.967
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE LOVE EACH OTHER,
ME AND MY BALD BROTHERS.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.933
STILL OBSESSED
WITH THAT NOTE, HUH?

20:22.967 --> 20:25.700
I-- I'VE ASKED
10 PEOPLE.

20:25.733 --> 20:28.100
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

20:28.133 --> 20:31.100
I CAN'T READ THIS.
COULD YOU MAKE OUT
ANY OF THAT HANDWRITING?

20:31.133 --> 20:32.400
- THIS FROM A DOCTOR?
- YEAH.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.367
TAKE IT
TO A PHARMACIST.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.833
- WHAT A GREAT IDEA.
- YEAH.

20:38.867 --> 20:41.067
THEY'RE THE ONLY
ONES WHO CAN MAKE OUT
A DOCTOR'S HANDWRITING.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.567
YEAH, GO!

20:45.133 --> 20:47.033
- OH, HI.
- HI.

20:47.067 --> 20:49.767
RRY DAVID.
I DROPPED OFF A PRESCRIPTION
THE OTHER DAY.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.467
- AH YES YES, HERE WE GO.
- YEAH.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.333
ACTUALLY, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.467
I'M GOING OUT
WITH A DOCTOR,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
AND SHE WROTE ME
THIS NOTE,

20:58.533 --> 21:00.767
- AND I CANNOT...
- AND YOU CAN'T READ IT.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.800
I CAN'T READ IT!
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.800
- NOBODY CAN!
- YES.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.600
SO SOMEBODY SUGGESTED
A PHARMACIST,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.533
'CAUSE NOBODY CAN
DECIPHER THIS THING.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.333
LET ME--
LET ME TAKE A SHOT.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.367
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.067
"LARRY, HAD A GREAT TIME
LAST NIGHT.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.800

21:22.367 --> 21:24.567
"...JUST THE TWO OF US."

21:24.600 --> 21:27.533
- ( sighs )
- "SO TIRED OF ALL THESE

21:27.567 --> 21:29.833
BROTHERS AND SISTERS
AROUND.

21:29.867 --> 21:33.067
I KNOW YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.633
TELL ME YOUR LIFE
WOULDN'T BE BETTER

21:35.667 --> 21:38.467
WITHOUT THE BLACKS."

21:38.500 --> 21:40.067
HUH?

21:41.500 --> 21:44.067
OH, OKAY, UH...
NO NO NO NO NO.

21:44.067 --> 21:46.333
Pharmacist: IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.500
- YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING IT.
- HERE'S YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

21:48.533 --> 21:50.767
- NO, SEE I'VE GOT--
- TAKE YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.133
- THANK YOU.

21:55.533 --> 21:58.200
THEY'RE BLACK BUT
THEIR NAME IS BLACK!

21:58.233 --> 22:00.833
SHE'S GOT...

22:00.867 --> 22:03.433
HER BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.600
( soft piano playing )

22:25.800 --> 22:28.067
Dr. Flomm:
IT'S OPEN.
COME ON IN.

22:29.467 --> 22:33.067
HI. YOU HAVE GOT
THE WORST HANDWRITING...

22:33.100 --> 22:34.800
- ( laughs )
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

22:34.833 --> 22:37.067
- NO? YOU COULDN'T READ IT?
- YOU EXPECT ANYBODY TO--

22:37.067 --> 22:39.167
- COULDN'T READ IT?
I GAVE IT TO 10,000--
- OH!

22:39.200 --> 22:41.633
- A PHARMACIST,
A PHARMACIST WOUND UP...
- I'M SO SORRY.

22:41.667 --> 22:44.367
- ...TRANSLATING THAT FOR ME.
- OH, I'M SORRY.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.633
MM.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.967
Larry:
THANKS FOR DRIVING ME HOME.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.467
REALLY, I--
I COULDN'T DRIVE.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.200
I JUST DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL LIKE--

23:17.233 --> 23:19.767
I FEEL NAUSEOUS
AND LIKE I'M DRUGGED
OR SOMETHING.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.267
AND AS FAR AS
WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER,

23:22.300 --> 23:25.267
I'M MEAN,
YOU KNOW, USUALLY LIKE,
FIVE-MISSISSIPPI.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.733
HONEST TO GOD,
FIVE-MISSISSIPPI--
( claps )

23:28.767 --> 23:30.633
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.967
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO?

23:38.867 --> 23:41.133
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT.

24:04.133 --> 24:06.467
UGH!

24:29.400 --> 24:31.800
( orchestra playing )

25:06.067 --> 25:07.867
( sighs )

25:09.367 --> 25:11.967
( Jeff snoring )

25:15.100 --> 25:17.133
Leon:
AHHH!

25:17.167 --> 25:20.167
SOMEBODY GO IN THERE
AND PUT A SOCK IN THAT
MOTHERFUCKER'S MOUTH!

25:20.200 --> 25:21.967
( knocks at door )

25:22.067 --> 25:23.867
( moaning )

25:23.900 --> 25:25.800
( knocks )

25:25.833 --> 25:27.800
ONE SECOND!

25:29.533 --> 25:31.500
( door-knocker rapping )

25:34.800 --> 25:37.133
HEY, L.D.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.200
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- COME ON IN, IT'S COLD.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.533
- YOU'RE BACK?
- YEAH. COULDN'T SLEEP.

25:41.567 --> 25:43.733
JEFF'S SNORE?
MAN, I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT WAS AWFUL.

25:43.767 --> 25:45.867
WORSE THAN
THE DAMN HURRICANE.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.900
- I KNOW, IT'S TERRIBLE.
- KIDS NEED TO SLEEP HERE.
Y'ALL GO ON UP TO BED.

25:48.933 --> 25:50.433
- GOOD NIGHT, LARRY.
- GOOD NIGHT.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.267
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM.
- GOOD NIGHT, Y'ALL.

25:52.300 --> 25:56.067
TALK TO YOUR BOY, MAN.
SHIT, THAT MOTHERFUCKER
SWALLOWED A KAZOO.

25:56.067 --> 25:59.233
- RIDICULOUS.
ALL FUCKING NIGHT!
- YEAH.

26:00.967 --> 26:03.067
COME ON!

26:03.067 --> 26:05.067
IT'S SAFE.
IT'S SAFE.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.433
ONE-MISSISSIPPI,
TWO-MISSISSIPPI,

26:07.467 --> 26:10.067
THREE-MISSISSIPPI...

26:10.100 --> 26:12.367
Jeff:
MY OWN DAUGHTER LOCKS
HERSELF IN HER ROOM,

26:12.400 --> 26:14.833
WON'T COME OUT
WHENEVER I'M HOME.

26:14.867 --> 26:17.900
MY WIFE--
ONE OF THE MOST WARM,
LOVING PEOPLE

26:17.933 --> 26:19.067
YOU COULD EVER MEET--

26:19.067 --> 26:21.500
HAS TURNED INTO A WITCH.

26:21.533 --> 26:24.467
A WITCH!
'CAUSE I'M BALD.
IT'S CHANGED EVERYTHING.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.100
BEN STILLER
WON'T WORK WITH ME

26:27.133 --> 26:30.467
BECAUSE I'M BALD!
I MEAN, COME ON.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.200
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS
I'M LOSING BECAUSE OF THAT?

26:33.233 --> 26:34.900
MILLIONS I'M LOSING!

26:34.933 --> 26:37.467
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY. THANK YOU.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.067
ALL RIGHT, MR. GREENE.
I UNDERSTAND NOW WE'RE
GOING TO HEAR

26:40.100 --> 26:42.367
FROM MR. LARRY DAVID,

26:42.400 --> 26:45.867
WHO WILL TESTIFY
ON MR. GREENE'S BEHALF.
MR. DAVID?

26:45.900 --> 26:48.133
- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.467
MR. DAVID, AS YOU KNOW,
WE ARE LOOKING INTO

26:50.500 --> 26:52.867
ALLEGATIONS
OF PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT

26:52.900 --> 26:55.100
STEMMING
FROM THE INCIDENT

26:55.133 --> 26:56.967
ON THE 17th
OF THIS MONTH.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.500
WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL
THE BOARD WHAT HAPPENED?

26:59.533 --> 27:02.367
I WAS HAVING LUNCH
IN THE CAFETERIA,

27:02.400 --> 27:05.567
AND I EXCUSED MYSELF
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.333
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S A THING WE ALL DO.

27:09.367 --> 27:11.333
IT'S NOT A CRIME, RIGHT?

27:11.367 --> 27:14.167
- DON'T HAVE
TO BE EMBARRASSED.
- NO NEED FOR EMBARRASSMENT.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.533
GO AHEAD.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.233
ANYWAY, I WENT
INTO THE STALL.

27:17.267 --> 27:20.400
GENERALLY, WHEN I--
WHEN I USE A PUBLIC TOILET,

27:20.433 --> 27:23.067
I'LL-- I'LL GO INTO THE STALL
AS OPPOSED TO THE URINALS.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.667
I FIND THERE'S, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO PRIVACY.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.533
AND IF THERE'S NO DIVIDERS,
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING
IN A TROUGH.

27:28.567 --> 27:30.467
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.667
ANYWAY, SO I WENT
INTO THE STALL--

27:32.700 --> 27:35.367
I GUESS IT'S KIND
OF A HABIT NOW

27:35.400 --> 27:37.500
FOR ME TO GO
INTO THE STALL, IN A WAY.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.767
UM, IF IT'S OPEN,
IF IT'S AVAILABLE,

27:39.800 --> 27:41.600
I'LL-- I'LL GENERALLY
TAKE THE STALL.

27:41.633 --> 27:44.833
OF COURSE, WHAT YOU
FIND IN THERE IS-- YOU KNOW,
IS ANYBODY'S GUESS.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.233
ANYWAY,
SO I'M IN THE STALL,

27:47.267 --> 27:51.733
AND I OVERHEAR THIS GUY
TALKING ON HIS CELL PHONE.

27:51.767 --> 27:55.067
AND HE'S TALKING
TO A FRIEND OF HIS, AND
HE'S GETTING VERY UPSET

27:55.067 --> 27:57.067
'CAUSE HE HAD TO MOVE
SOME FURNITURE

27:57.067 --> 27:59.367
AND HE HURT HIS HAND.
AND HE-- AND HE'S SAYING,

27:59.400 --> 28:02.167

'CAUSE THIS 300-LB--"
