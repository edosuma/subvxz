WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:06.340
Y'all gonna just stand around,

00:06.374 --> 00:08.609
or you wanna ask me
some questions?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.311
<i>Dad got fired from his
job at the White House.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:11.579
We can move anywhere.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.247
<i>Daddy did not get fired.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:14.648
Mitchell will be the
one holding the bag, trust me.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.050
<i>Probably be happy
to go to prison</i>

00:16.083 --> 00:17.451
<i>to get away from Martha.</i>

00:17.485 --> 00:19.520
<i>Conspiracy to commit burglary</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:20.755
<i>and wiretapping.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:22.757
I sentence you
to the maximum penalty

00:22.790 --> 00:24.525
allowable under federal law.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.127
<i>We'll reconvene
in two months' time</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:27.528
<i>to formalizing sentencing.</i>

00:27.561 --> 00:29.397
<i>You ever threaten
to squeal again,</i>

00:29.430 --> 00:31.532
it'll be the last time
you ever squeal.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.367
Pat Gray is feeding me
their reports, okay?

00:33.401 --> 00:34.735
You satisfied?

00:34.769 --> 00:36.237
<i>Oh, director
of the FBI. Very impressive.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.438
It's only a matter of time

00:37.471 --> 00:38.572
<i>before they figure out
what's going on.</i>

00:38.606 --> 00:40.107
Maybe it's the routine
that scares me.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.509
<i>I just want you to know</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.077
<i>I can't imagine the rest
of my life without it.</i>

00:43.110 --> 00:44.812
My own boy, Jay, is over there

00:45.045 --> 00:46.614
<i>fighting for his life
as we speak.</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:48.816
- Who is it for you?
- My little brother.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.218
I'm a doer. I don't just
sit around and do nothing.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.720
<i>And if you don't do
your own talking,</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:55.256
<i>someone is gonna do it for you
in this town.</i>

00:55.289 --> 00:56.290
<i>Should the Nixon administration</i>

00:56.323 --> 00:57.725
be afraid of you,
Mrs. Mitchell?

00:57.758 --> 00:59.293
Well, I think you know
the answer to that.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.594
Attagirl, Martha.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.642
Good afternoon.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.510
Uh, the president would like
to assure the public

01:16.544 --> 01:18.446
that when it comes
to illicit profit

01:18.479 --> 01:22.450
from land deals in California,
uh, he has nothing to hide,

01:22.483 --> 01:25.286
uh, despite what leftist
Democrats might allege.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
<i>On the contrary,
the president</i>

01:27.688 --> 01:29.690
<i>has paid his full
and normal tax load,</i>

01:29.723 --> 01:31.859
<i>just like any citizen.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:34.128
Therefore, an examination
of his personal taxes

01:34.161 --> 01:36.163
at this point
feels like a political ploy

01:36.197 --> 01:38.365
and is simply not necessary.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.167
Any further update
on the subject

01:40.201 --> 01:42.203
will come through
official channels, uh,

01:42.236 --> 01:45.172
before you hear it in the
secretarial pool at <i>The Post.</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:47.441
<i>And with that,
I'd like to open it up</i>

01:47.475 --> 01:48.742
to any questions.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.311
- Mr. Ziegler.
- <i>Over here.</i>

01:50.344 --> 01:51.445
Helen.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.714
Yes, I was wondering
if the White House

01:53.747 --> 01:56.584
has any comments
on the accusations

01:56.617 --> 01:58.886
currently being levied
against the president--

01:59.119 --> 02:01.222
Yeah, now uh, before you go
any further, Helen.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.556
Uh, I have been made aware

02:02.590 --> 02:04.658
that there is a certain
citizen individual

02:04.692 --> 02:06.260
who has gotten herself
some attention,

02:06.293 --> 02:07.561
uh, in the press as of late--

02:07.595 --> 02:08.696
Martha Mitchell.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.665
Well, I'm not naming
any names, Helen.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.534
<i>Um, but I would
just like to say</i>

02:13.567 --> 02:15.569
<i>that we all have
a certain nature,</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:18.138
something to which
we must adhere.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.508
And the nature of this
particular individual

02:20.541 --> 02:23.410
has been rather bellicose
and unreliable.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.549
Please welcome a woman
who's fast becoming

02:28.582 --> 02:30.551
the biggest thorn
in Richard Nixon's side

02:30.584 --> 02:32.553
since Pat shoved him
into the rose garden...

02:33.654 --> 02:35.489
...the captivating, controversial,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.358
undeniable Martha Mitchell.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.561
Mike, you make me sound
like a best seller.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.630
Now, Martha,
you are the first person

02:42.663 --> 02:44.431
that I'm aware of
to publicly accuse

02:44.465 --> 02:47.268
the president of responsibility
for the Watergate break-in.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.236
Pretty sure
I won't be the last.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.540
But Mrs. Mitchell's making
some very grave accusations

02:52.573 --> 02:53.908
against the president.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.376
I would be remiss to point out

02:55.409 --> 02:57.511
that they are accusations
that no one else has made.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.580
<i>President Nixon
has been re-elected</i>

02:59.613 --> 03:00.581
<i>by a landslide.</i>

03:03.617 --> 03:05.719
<i>♪ Sitting
Cross-legged on the floor ♪</i>

03:05.753 --> 03:07.187

03:09.924 --> 03:12.326
<i>♪ Twenty-five
Or six to four... ♪</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:14.361
<i>I, Richard Nixon,

03:14.395 --> 03:17.398
<i>I will faithfully
execute the office</i>

03:17.431 --> 03:19.600
<i>of president
of the United States.</i>

03:19.633 --> 03:20.868
You also accused the president

03:20.901 --> 03:23.470
of ordering your alleged
imprisonment in California.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.739
Yes, I do, and I-I also believe

03:25.773 --> 03:27.341
that the president
is attempting

03:27.374 --> 03:30.311
to leave my husband holding
the bag for his dirty tricks,

03:30.344 --> 03:31.679
and I won't let that happen.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.314
You always speak
your mind on our show, Martha.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.782
- We really appreciate that.
- I do. I speak my mind.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.550
I am a Southern woman.
We speak our minds.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.485
We talk. I never stop talking.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.820
I bet your husband
just loves that.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.555
He takes it in stride.

03:43.257 --> 03:47.761
<i>♪ Wanting just
To stay awake... ♪</i>

03:47.795 --> 03:49.697
What?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.231
They're admirers.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.602
Jimmy, it's been so long,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.503
I was beginning to think
we weren't friends anymore.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.272
<i>♪ Should I try
To do some more... ♪</i>

03:58.305 --> 04:00.407
What you hearing at <i>The Tribune</i>
these days, anyway?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.309
I don't think the woman's
in her right mind.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.411
She might
call herself a Republican,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.246
but she's not one of us.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.281
She's a truth teller.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.282
Well, look at what they did

04:08.315 --> 04:09.516
to poor Dorothy Hunt?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.318
She was on that horrible plane
that crashed,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.587
and then they found
$10,000 cash on her.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.623
Seeing as how this person
cannot be stopped

04:15.656 --> 04:17.591
or reasoned with in any way,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.326
uh, the White House
harbors the fervent hope

04:19.360 --> 04:21.895
that she can avail herself
of familial comfort

04:21.929 --> 04:22.997
and professional help.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.019
Oh!

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
<i>What do you say
about the rumors</i>

04:46.854 --> 04:48.789
out of the White House that
you've struggled with alcohol?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.392
I say a rumor is just
a lie without a home.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.061
She's a lush
and a pill popper too.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.296
She's got problems
emotionally and whatnot,

04:56.330 --> 04:57.564
but, um, who doesn't?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
<i>They were the ones
that stonewalled</i>

05:01.935 --> 05:04.638
Wright Patman's committee
in the House last October.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.739
Well, then I can be
your source,

05:05.773 --> 05:06.974
'cause I'm telling you
it's factual.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.375
Oh, you know
what I forgot to ask you?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.077
Did you get those Hummels
I sent after the wedding?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.679
And you stated elsewhere
that your goal

05:11.712 --> 05:13.047
is to take down Nixon.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.416
But the president's approval
numbers just keep climbing.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.650
If the American people

05:16.684 --> 05:18.652
knew half of what I do
about their government,

05:18.686 --> 05:20.521
they wouldn't have much
to approve of.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.989
So Mrs. Mitchell's behavior

05:22.022 --> 05:24.725
isn't getting to the first lady
or the president,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.326
as has been reported?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.695
Do you hear yourself
when you ask these questions?

05:27.728 --> 05:28.962
I mean, for criminy's sake,
come on.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.464
Let me ask
the obvious question.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.999
What is obvious?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.333
Are you crazy?

05:33.367 --> 05:34.501
Yeah.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.639
Frickin' loudmouth.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.673
Freedom-loving.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.974
Limousine liberal.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.009
Groovy liberated.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.577
Commie bitch.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.388
<i>All rise.</i>

05:55.756 --> 05:57.491
<i>This court is now in session</i>

05:57.524 --> 06:00.594
<i>with the Honorable
Judge John Sirica presiding.</i>

06:01.762 --> 06:02.963
You may be seated.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.137
Gentlemen, I called you in
today for a formal sentencing.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.841
But first,
I'd like to say a few words.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.110
<i>When I was a younger man,</i>

06:16.143 --> 06:19.446
<i>Jack Dempsey
was my sparring partner.</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:22.049
<i>I don't say that to boast,</i>

06:22.082 --> 06:24.718
<i>and I certainly
don't say it to imply</i>

06:24.752 --> 06:27.154
that I wasn't getting pummeled
every Tuesday at the Y.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.426
But I know what it means
to have heart.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.595
And frankly, the group of you
have shown a lot of heart,

06:34.628 --> 06:37.664
<i>taking all the licks you have
in this courtroom.</i>

06:37.698 --> 06:41.068
<i>And I believe
it's to be commended.</i>

06:41.101 --> 06:43.137
<i>But a fighter also has to know</i>

06:43.170 --> 06:45.405
<i>when it's time
to throw in the towel.</i>

06:46.607 --> 06:49.877
Which brings me
to a very interesting letter

06:49.910 --> 06:51.145
I received this morning...

06:54.148 --> 06:55.883
...from Mr. McCord.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.452
<i>"Certain questions
have been posed to me</i>

06:58.485 --> 07:00.888
<i>from Your Honor through
the probation officer"--</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:02.122
You rat fuck!

07:02.156 --> 07:04.958
I'll fucking--
I'll fucking kill you!

07:04.992 --> 07:05.959
<i>Order!</i>

07:05.993 --> 07:07.528
I will fucking kill you!

07:07.561 --> 07:09.029
- <i>Remove him!</i>
- You fuck!

07:09.062 --> 07:10.964
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

07:10.998 --> 07:13.100
You fuck!
I should've fucking killed you

07:13.133 --> 07:14.601
when I had the chance!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.770
- <i>Get him out of here!</i>
- You fuck!

07:53.607 --> 07:54.608
Come in.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.148
The partners brought these over
for you to sign.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.550
How are you settling in?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.952
Oh, you know.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.186
I know.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.724
Looking like
you got a little sun.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.125
Oh, stop.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.828
Any calls from the White House?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.167
They're probably just...

08:20.200 --> 08:22.135
busy.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.973
I ran two of Dick's campaigns,
the ones he won.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.543
<i>The least you'd think
I could expect is to get</i>

08:29.576 --> 08:32.880
a goddamn fucking call back.

08:34.648 --> 08:38.652
Oh, I never saw that one.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.787
<i>Look at those two young men.</i>

08:40.821 --> 08:42.289
Not my best angle.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.791
Oh, stop. You look handsome.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.862
You know, I always wondered.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.566
Do he and Pat ever...

08:53.800 --> 08:56.169
Oh.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.071
Not since Trish was born.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.245
Too bad.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.783
And, uh, Mr. Mitchell,
if you ever need anything,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.285
uh, I'm right outside
your door.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.719
You know that, right?

09:12.753 --> 09:15.022
Of course. Thank you, Diana.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.284
God damn it.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.686
<i>I'm sorry</i>

09:45.719 --> 09:46.954
<i>to bother you again,
Mr. Mitchell,</i>

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
<i>but I-I think you should
turn on the news.</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:54.194
In what reads like a wish list

09:54.227 --> 09:56.997
for the prosecution,
James McCord's letter alleges

09:57.030 --> 10:00.100
a massive campaign
of sabotage and obstruction

10:00.133 --> 10:02.069
on the part
of the Nixon administration.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.805
Reports from Capitol Hill
cite Mr. McCord's letter

10:04.838 --> 10:07.074
as a reason to open
a Senate committee

10:07.107 --> 10:09.009
dedicated
to the Watergate matter.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.644
If that happens, both present

10:10.677 --> 10:12.879
and former members
of the administration

10:12.913 --> 10:15.015
may become targets
of the investigation.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.650
<i>The news will come as a shock</i>

10:16.683 --> 10:18.352
<i>to the newly
re-elected president,</i>

10:18.385 --> 10:20.620
<i>who might have considered
the burgeoning scandal</i>

10:20.654 --> 10:22.189
<i>safely behind him.</i>

10:26.159 --> 10:28.195
<i>"Mr. McCord
has joined lone voices</i>

10:28.228 --> 10:30.764
"in the wilderness
such as Martha Mitchell

10:30.797 --> 10:33.300
"in publicly implicating
the president's closest aides

10:33.333 --> 10:34.801
in the Watergate break-in."

10:34.835 --> 10:36.203
Well, at least now
they will see

10:36.236 --> 10:38.405
I was right about
the whole rotten lot of 'em.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.806
Are you sure
you don't want any?

10:39.840 --> 10:40.974
Yes, thank you.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.776
Mm.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.679
Boy, they've really
got 'em lined up now.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.381
Bunch of bowling pins.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.151
Martha, can we focus
on the book?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.253
I-I really wanna get
some work done today.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.822
Oh. Of course.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.891
You have my undivided attention.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.028
So the Pine Bluffs
records office

11:01.061 --> 11:03.330
didn't have a death certificate
on file for your father--

11:03.363 --> 11:05.298
Oh, Maria! Ooh!

11:06.233 --> 11:09.302
This is my good friend Maria
from back in the New York days.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.738
Maria, this is
Winzola McLendon.

11:11.772 --> 11:15.175
She is my biographer
and a first-rate journalist.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.777
Right up there
with Helen Thomas.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.846
A biography?

11:19.880 --> 11:23.784
Martha, you are too much
for this town, I swear.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.786
Oh, guess who I ran into
at the A&P.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.020
- Who?
- <i>Jay.</i>

11:28.755 --> 11:30.257
Jay, your son?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.225
You said he was
still in Vietnam.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.795
Oh, no, he's been
stateside for a while now.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.763
Living with all those Jews
down in Baltimore.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.733
<i>He's such a kind boy.
Won the Silver Star, you know.</i>

11:39.766 --> 11:41.368
Purple Heart.
Now, did he mention to you

11:41.401 --> 11:43.336
that he has moved in with
that little girlfriend of his?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.072
I darn near hit the roof.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.208
Can I interview him?
For the book.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.811
But you have me,
the greatest source of all.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.183
Yes, it just might be
interesting is all.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.052
Well, of course,
if that's what you want to do,

11:59.086 --> 12:00.887
but I will give you
a piece of advice.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.122
<i>If that little girlfriend
of his</i>

12:02.155 --> 12:04.758
invites you over for dinner,
take an entrée.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.259
She's a vegetarian.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.764
Although there are reports
that the convicted

12:10.797 --> 12:12.933
Watergate conspirators
might be first

12:12.966 --> 12:15.235
to testify
at the formal hearings,

12:15.268 --> 12:17.337
which begin a week
from Thursday,

12:17.370 --> 12:20.140
Ervin and Baker would only say
that the witness list

12:20.173 --> 12:21.942
will be out later this week.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.844
<i>And the first set
of hearings will last...</i>

12:23.877 --> 12:24.978
<i>Hey there!</i>

12:25.011 --> 12:27.214
How's married life
treating you, champ?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.849
Uh, it's only been
a week,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.118
but so far, so good.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.486
Yeah, Mo is a-a little peeved

12:32.519 --> 12:34.454
we had to stick around D.C.,
and, uh--

12:34.488 --> 12:37.491
Oh, I'm so sorry you had
to cancel your honeymoon.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.827
Now this damn McCord letter's
gotten everybody in a fright.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.095
Yeah, no, it's, uh--
it's all right.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.797
You know, we hadn't
actually left yet,

12:43.830 --> 12:46.433
so it was just a matter
of unpacking.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.068
<i>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:51.171
Well, still, the president,
he feels awful about it.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.440
He and the first lady
would like to gift you

12:53.473 --> 12:55.008
a little getaway weekend.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.977
<i>Something to tide you over
until you and the missus</i>

12:57.010 --> 12:59.079
can spring
for the real honeymoon.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.884
- You gotta be shitting me.
- No.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.785
<i>President never shits anyone
about Camp David.</i>

13:05.819 --> 13:08.121
<i>Here are the keys.</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:10.857
Directions, list of amenities
should be included.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.892
This is unbelievable.

13:11.925 --> 13:15.896
I-I--thank you so, so much. I--

13:15.929 --> 13:16.997
Oh, my God, Mo's gonna flip.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.132
I--this--
I don't know what to say.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.467
- You earned it. No.
- Oh.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.169
And look, it'll be good
to have a little time away

13:22.202 --> 13:24.404
from the city to write that
investigative report, right?

13:26.006 --> 13:27.874
I'm sor--um...

13:27.908 --> 13:31.111
sorry, i-investigative report?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.246
Oh, yeah. Did nobody tell you?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.349
Oh, huh. Oh, okay.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.585
No, it's just something, uh,
Dick wants typed up.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.121
You know, some legalese
that separates the White House

13:41.154 --> 13:42.322
from any involvement.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.257
You know, boilerplate stuff,
something to help

13:44.291 --> 13:46.293
put an end to all this
Watergate fuss, but...

13:46.326 --> 13:48.495
Well, right, right.
It-it-it's just, um--

13:48.528 --> 13:49.829
<i>Sir.</i>

13:49.863 --> 13:51.932
It's Mitchell calling
for you again.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.133
Oh.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.035
Can you, uh, tell him
I'm in a meeting, Kay?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.469
- Yes, sir.
- Please. Thank you.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.838
<i>Goddamn.</i>

13:58.872 --> 14:02.075
<i>That pathetic bastard.
He just--he won't take a hint.</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:03.310
You know?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.045
Don't tell me
he's been calling you too.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.148
Well, once or twice.
I-I haven't actually answered.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.017
Yeah, I tell you,
he should do something useful

14:11.051 --> 14:13.320
and put a shovel to that
embarrassment of a wife.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.427
You-you go enjoy Camp David.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.596
Uh, well, uh,
as I was saying, sir,

14:22.629 --> 14:24.998
um, you, uh--
about that report--

14:25.031 --> 14:27.100
Yes.

14:27.133 --> 14:30.537
Do--you know, with all
the r-renewed media scrutiny,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.138
do you really think it's wise

14:32.172 --> 14:36.209
that I put my name
on an investigative report

14:36.243 --> 14:40.013
without doing
an actual investigation?

14:42.115 --> 14:43.984
Hmm.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.187
Yeah, could seem
a little fishy, huh?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.323
I mean, I-I-I could be indicted
for obstruction of justice.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.424
Technically.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.959
Right. Yeah.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.661
No, you know what? Forget it.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.296
Really?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.931
The president would never wanna
put you in a tough position.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.165
- Right. Of course, yeah.
- Not at all.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.167
No, we got it covered,
lover boy, all right?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.637
You go enjoy Camp David,
all right?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.406
I will. Thank you, sir.
My goodness.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.642
This is--this is incredible.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.210
You're so welcome.
No, you've earned it.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.378
I'll send you a postcard.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.146
Okay, please do.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.214
- <i>Thank you, sir.</i>
- All right. Have fun.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.348
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:35.235 --> 15:36.403
Kay, could you be a doll, please,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.371
and get me John Mitchell now?

15:38.405 --> 15:39.439
Thank you.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.455
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.690
Good day.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.125
Um...

15:59.159 --> 16:01.127
firstly, I want to commend you
on your excellent work

16:01.161 --> 16:03.129
as part
of the Watergate task force.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.199
There's a lot of armchair
quarterbacks in this town,

16:06.232 --> 16:07.567
but I think
we could all benefit

16:07.600 --> 16:10.036
from a lot more
positive reinforcement.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.239
Am I right?
This guy knows I'm right.

16:13.273 --> 16:18.078
Secondly,
you may hear some news

16:18.111 --> 16:20.680
over the next few days

16:20.714 --> 16:24.217
about my leadership, uh,
of the bureau.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.254
The last year or so,
it seems I have been

16:28.288 --> 16:33.026
in communication, um, with...

16:33.059 --> 16:35.628
certain folks
at the White House...

16:35.662 --> 16:39.165
regarding the state
of the investigation,

16:39.199 --> 16:41.234
giving them...

16:41.267 --> 16:44.003
copies of the 302s
and so forth.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.739
Copies of the 302s?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.607
- And--
- Excuse me, sir.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.109
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16:50.110 --> 16:54.681
You're not saying that you've
been leaking our investigation

16:54.714 --> 16:58.051
to the people
we've been investigating.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.189
I mean, I wouldn't exactly,

17:03.223 --> 17:06.626
but, uh, yeah, that's, uh,

17:06.659 --> 17:07.794
about right, yeah.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.330
That sounds, uh, accurate.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.101
And all that's gonna come out.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.271
<i>Uh, at this point,
I think it might be in keeping</i>

17:18.304 --> 17:20.240
with my desire to create

17:20.273 --> 17:24.043
a more open and, uh, inclusive
working environment

17:24.077 --> 17:28.214
that I would open up, uh,
the forum to some questions.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.620
Which you-you can...

17:33.653 --> 17:35.622
submit in writing
to my secretary

17:35.655 --> 17:37.424
to be answered
at a future date.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.161
Un-fucking-believable.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.062
Ah.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.731
Look at the time.
I've gotta run to a meeting.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.468
Uh, great work. Thank you.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.637
Let's keep this going.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.410
I can't believe it.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.445
I can.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.680
Fuck it.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.849
If Gray's gonna be stuck
doing damage control,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.284
forget the protocol.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.152
Why don't we just start doing
real police work?

18:14.794 --> 18:17.130

John, welcome back.
You've been missed.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.261
He's just been so busy lately.
You know how he gets.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.495
Well, I ought to.

- How are ya, chief?

Chuck,
what are you all doing here?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.647

19:40.680 --> 19:42.382

Yeah, have a seat.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.387
Uh, scotch? You prefer gin?

John Dean's the only faggot

19:49.656 --> 19:51.224
who drinks gin around here.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.362
Maybe I should schedule

19:56.396 --> 19:58.531
when it's a better time
for the president.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.900
That won't be necessary.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.703
We could use your input
on a couple of details

20:03.736 --> 20:04.771
he's been asking us about.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.972
Yeah, couple sticky wickets.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.574
A few things you can
clear up for us, sir.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.342
Mm-hmm, what-what-what do you--
what do you got?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.611
<i>Well, for instance...</i>

20:11.644 --> 20:13.813
this Gordon Liddy character.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.783
Now, he was part of your outfit
at CREEP, correct?

20:16.816 --> 20:19.319
<i>Him, Hunt, and McCord?</i>

20:19.352 --> 20:20.653
You've met Liddy.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.757
You've all met Liddy.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.529
Hmm. I don't recall that.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.897
<i>No. Me neither.</i>

20:30.930 --> 20:33.366
<i>Drawing a complete blank.</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:37.403
Maybe you could just
refresh us on exactly

20:37.437 --> 20:39.272
- how you recruited him.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:39.305 --> 20:41.307
<i>You know, in fact,</i>

20:41.341 --> 20:43.843
<i>might be best if you
just took us</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:46.245
<i>through the whole
planning and operation</i>

20:46.279 --> 20:48.014
<i>- of the thing from your end.</i>
- <i>Just for clarity.</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:50.416
Just we can see
how it all came together.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.553
You put the ball in motion
on this thing, correct?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.787
The break-in was
your brainchild, right?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.389
<i>That's right.</i>

21:07.700 --> 21:11.404
You know, John...

21:11.437 --> 21:13.873
...I'm-I'm a little fuzzy
on it.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.944
In fact, the only break-in
I can remember is, uh...

21:17.977 --> 21:18.978
the Ellsberg.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.813
That was your job, right?

21:20.847 --> 21:24.350
And, Bob, weren't you point
on that plan

21:24.384 --> 21:26.686
to firebomb
the Brookings Institute?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.888
Or-or was that you, Chuck?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.556
It was a shame
that one didn't happen.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.825
I-I thought there'd be
a great weenie roast.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.996
All right.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.599
And then there's
those nights where--

21:39.632 --> 21:40.800
where we all sat up,

21:40.833 --> 21:43.603
trying to figure out
how to secretly bomb

21:43.636 --> 21:44.971
the fuck out of Cambodia.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.774
I think we get the point.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.841
Have you got the point,

21:48.875 --> 21:50.576
or you need it
fucked up your ass

21:50.610 --> 21:52.945
and broken off
on the other end?

22:06.059 --> 22:07.393
I was fucking with you.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.494
Yup. You're so tense.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.762
You fucker.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.065
<i>He's fucking with us!</i>

22:12.098 --> 22:14.834
All right, well, uh,
I think that's about it.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.437
Thanks for coming in,
you friendless sack of shit.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.772
I have enjoyed every minute
of it, you fuck-for-brains.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.873
<i>Can't wait for this one</i>

22:20.907 --> 22:22.442
to be frog-marched
to prison, huh?

22:22.475 --> 22:23.976
You talentless bunch
of shit-gibbons

22:24.010 --> 22:25.845
are more likely
to be the first there.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.046
What do you think?
What do you think?

22:27.080 --> 22:28.081
Get ass cancer and die.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.515
Bye-bye, now.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.054
Wait.
Are there microphones in here?

22:35.088 --> 22:36.989
- <i>Jesus, Chuck.</i>
- Wh-which--

22:37.023 --> 22:38.591
They're in here, right?
They're in there.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.726
That's where they are.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.794
<i>Oval Office.</i>

22:56.809 --> 22:58.945
Oh, no.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.580
No, no, no.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.682
- No, no.
- Mr. Magruder!

23:02.715 --> 23:04.383
How you doing today?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.651
I don't know
if we've formally met.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.787
I'm Special Agent Angelo Lano.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.655
This is my partner,
Paul Magallanes.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.858
- No way. No way. Thank you.
- What's going on?

23:11.891 --> 23:12.959
I-I know who you are.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.694
I've seen you around.
I gotta go.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.395
I gotta pick up my kid
for the dentist.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.134
Well, we were wondering

23:21.167 --> 23:22.468
if you could help us clear up

23:22.502 --> 23:23.836
some of the illicit communications

23:23.870 --> 23:26.572
between CREEP
and FBI Director Gray.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.908
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, uh, Pancho Villa,

23:28.941 --> 23:30.443
because I-I don't know anything

23:30.476 --> 23:33.112
about any secret, uh,
communications--

23:33.146 --> 23:35.615
illicit communications
with the FBI.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.450
So why don't you two,
you know, buzz off?

23:37.483 --> 23:38.718
Mr. Magruder,
I know you don't wanna

23:38.751 --> 23:40.720
find yourself
on the business end

23:40.753 --> 23:43.456
of a 14-year sentence
for obstruction of justice.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.824
- <i>Hey, okay.</i>
- Or do you?

23:44.857 --> 23:46.993
Okay, I know what you're trying
to do here, all right?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.929
You think that you can, uh,
you know, just intimidate me

23:49.962 --> 23:52.064
because I'm just
gonna roll over

23:52.098 --> 23:53.833
and let you fuck me up the ass.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.036
Yeah.
That's right. That's right.

23:57.069 --> 24:01.107
You wanna come here
to my place of business,

24:01.140 --> 24:02.642
and you wanna fuck me.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.677
You wanna fuck me up the ass.
Both of you.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.748
Please get yourselves
off of my Oldsmobile.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.016
All right.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.617
Maybe it's time we give
the poor guy a break.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.519
- He's not talking.
- No? You don't think so?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.754
I don't think so.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.888
That's too bad,
because the first one

24:15.922 --> 24:18.224
who talks gets
sweetheart deal, right?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.126
That's right.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.795
I don't want
the sweetheart deal.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.897
Man of steel,
gotta give him that.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.799
Fort fucking Knox.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.034
We'll see you soon.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.169
Why? Why would you see me?

24:30.203 --> 24:32.471
I don't--I don't know anything.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.807
Did you not hear me tell you?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.977
I am ignorant of what
you are talking about.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.246
You fuck me, I fuck you.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.247
- All right.
- Yup.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.648
I fuck you.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.753
See you soon, Jeb.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.872
I wouldn't be the first, right?

26:25.318 --> 26:28.220
They're-they're beaming
these in from a-a satellite?

26:29.889 --> 26:31.724
- This one's from Japan.
- Mm.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.992
Isn't that far out?

26:40.066 --> 26:41.200
<i>Hey, what's wrong?</i>

26:44.003 --> 26:48.074
My mother is such
a complicated woman,

26:48.107 --> 26:51.277
but she would always tell me
that she knew

26:51.310 --> 26:53.145
that she was going to spend
the rest of her life

26:53.179 --> 26:55.247
with my father from the moment
that she met him,

26:55.281 --> 26:58.084
and I was always looking
for that exact same feeling

26:58.117 --> 27:00.319
and so worried
that I didn't feel it

27:00.353 --> 27:02.388
or couldn't feel it
at all and--

27:02.621 --> 27:04.223
And you felt it
when you met me.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.324
No, that's what I'm saying.

27:05.358 --> 27:09.695
I, at first, hated you
so much, so much.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.365
Oh, it was overwhelming.
You must've felt that, John.

27:13.766 --> 27:18.137
But then I got to know you,
and all of a sudden, I...

27:23.809 --> 27:25.644
...I just--I don't know.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.847
It's not anything like my mom
said it would be.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.649
I feel like I'm only capable

27:30.683 --> 27:32.685
of loving you desperately

27:32.718 --> 27:33.886
or hating your guts,

27:33.919 --> 27:37.156
which I still do
some afternoons.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.891
That's not very romantic,
is it?

27:38.924 --> 27:41.861
I--you know what it is?
I'm drunk.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.095
- No.
- That's all it is.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.698
You're-you're scared.

27:45.731 --> 27:47.066
I don't know. Maybe.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.368
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm scared too.

27:49.402 --> 27:52.438
I've never been here before.
I don't know how all this ends.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.442
But I know that we're here.
We made it this far.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.678
We're at Camp David.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.083
I don't know,
I thought getting married

28:04.116 --> 28:06.986
was supposed to take away
the fear.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.955
We have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.191
Oh.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.461
Is that Mama Cass?

28:16.295 --> 28:18.030
Refill on your drink,
Mrs. Kennedy?

28:18.064 --> 28:19.965
That sounds--yeah.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.901
Why don't you make it a double?

28:21.934 --> 28:24.270
Oh, I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.092
The investigation
should be thorough

28:46.125 --> 28:47.893
and aboveboard.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.795
<i>- And second...</i>
- Your boyfriend's on.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.831
<i>...that if there were
any higher involvement,</i>

28:51.864 --> 28:54.233
<i>we should get
the facts out first.</i>

28:55.334 --> 28:57.937
<i>White House counsel
John Dean has been assigned</i>

28:57.970 --> 29:00.372
to monitor
these investigations.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.408
I entrusted the task
of getting me

29:02.441 --> 29:04.743
<i>the written report
to Mr. Dean.</i>

29:04.777 --> 29:06.412
Whatever the facts might be,

29:06.445 --> 29:10.249
I wanted the White House to be
the first to make them public.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.051
- Shall we march?
- Yeah.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.819
In the streets! In the streets!

29:13.853 --> 29:16.188
- <i>All right.</i>
- Free Martha Mitchell!

29:16.222 --> 29:17.957
Free Martha Mitchell!

29:17.990 --> 29:19.825
<i>I have put down
the only earrings</i>

29:19.859 --> 29:22.361
that go with this necklace,
and I just cannot--

29:22.394 --> 29:23.963
Now I'm late.

29:23.996 --> 29:24.964
<i>...here
on the par-three golf course</i>

29:24.997 --> 29:27.032
<i>on Monday night...</i>

29:27.066 --> 29:28.300
You have been moping for weeks

29:28.334 --> 29:32.071
while I have been out
defending our reputation.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.072
Oh.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.373
From where I sit,

29:34.406 --> 29:37.209
looks a bit more self-serving
than that.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.145
Self-serving?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.280
Look at these freaks.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.849
Free Martha Mitchell!

29:43.883 --> 29:47.887
You're practically a teen idol,
just what you always wanted.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.223
<i>That'll goose book sales.</i>

29:51.257 --> 29:52.491
We're looking
at boarding schools.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.293
Be sure to clear your schedule.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.862
Diana'll take care of that.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.297
She's very attentive.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.539
Don't, uh, let Marty
stay up too late.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.442
And there's pot roast in
the kitchen if you get hungry.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.579
I won't.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.219
What the hell, Bob?

30:20.252 --> 30:21.487
Come on, you--

30:21.520 --> 30:24.423
No, you said I didn't have
to write that report.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.591
Well, the president's
plastering it

30:25.824 --> 30:26.859
all over the news.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.294
That's-that's my name
out there.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.929
I could go to jail for this.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.531
Listen. I am on your side.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.467
But Dick just isn't
gonna budge on this.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.870
If you nut up
and do the right thing,

30:37.903 --> 30:40.406
then it'll just be
a lot easier for everyone.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.074
Is-is that a threat?

30:42.107 --> 30:43.409
Of course not, buddy.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.911
I just want to help you
get out of your own way.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.479
I hope you're having fun
up there.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.116
No, Bob. Bob? Bob?

30:52.551 --> 30:55.054
What song is sung at a
dress-up party on Fire Island?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.559
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

31:07.266 --> 31:11.370
I feel like
something's going on.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.113
Whoo-ooh.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.895
Somebody was hungry.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.523
<i>I just--I feel strong
when I'm with you.</i>

32:04.556 --> 32:06.358
<i>Like I can do anything.</i>

32:06.392 --> 32:08.127
<i>Oh, John.</i>

32:08.160 --> 32:09.361
<i>When we're in the office together,</i>

32:09.395 --> 32:11.263
<i>I can barely stand it.</i>

32:11.297 --> 32:14.233
<i>I want you inside me so badly.</i>

32:14.266 --> 32:17.303
<i>Mm. Soon.</i>

32:17.336 --> 32:19.204
<i>We'll book a room
at the Roosevelt</i>

32:19.238 --> 32:20.706
<i>and sneak off.</i>

32:40.693 --> 32:42.628
You really think
this is gonna work,

32:42.661 --> 32:44.697
just sitting here like this?

32:44.730 --> 32:46.732
Oh, yeah.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.233
Big-time.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.569
Once we had
this potential witness

32:50.602 --> 32:51.970
in a white-collar case.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.972
Criminal mastermind
like this guy here.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.741
<i>We did everything
to get him to talk,</i>

32:55.974 --> 32:57.009
<i>but nothing worked.</i>

32:57.042 --> 32:58.510
<i>Then my partner
gets this idea,</i>

32:58.544 --> 32:59.611
stake out his house
for the weekend

32:59.645 --> 33:01.647
just for the fuck of it.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.550
I'm telling you,
within seven hours,

33:04.583 --> 33:08.187
this asshole comes out
to the car and says he'll talk.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.389
- Wow.
- Yeah.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.324
It's one thing to feel like
a criminal when you're alone.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.525
It's another thing to feel it

33:13.559 --> 33:15.427
when you're with your wife,
your children.

33:15.461 --> 33:19.765
It feels invasive somehow, unbearable.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.334
He'll be singing
to the special prosecutor

33:22.368 --> 33:24.236
by tomorrow morning.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.438
<i>Deputy campaign director.</i>

33:26.472 --> 33:27.773
Guy shouldn't be
deputy director

33:28.006 --> 33:30.642
of a fuckin' White Castle.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.078
It--this is some charmed
gringo shit right here.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.348
- That's what that is.
- What do you mean, gringo shit?

33:36.382 --> 33:38.384
You saw when new assignments
went up last week, right?

33:38.417 --> 33:39.585
Yeah.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.719
All the Hispanic guys
got shit jobs, right?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.087
Well...

33:42.121 --> 33:43.288
- Well?
- Yeah.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.425
- Translation. Transcription.
- Okay.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.060
You know what they used
to call guys like me

33:48.093 --> 33:49.428
- when I was at the Academy?
- What?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.462
The Taco Squad.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.730
Don't laugh.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.732
That's cafeteria shit-talk.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.067
It's not a big thing.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.370
So you're telling me

33:58.404 --> 34:01.573
it wouldn't get under your skin
if you were part of the--

34:01.607 --> 34:04.243
I don't know,
the-the-the Dago Division?

34:07.279 --> 34:09.348
Look, I'm just sayin',

34:09.381 --> 34:13.352
we're all jockeying for a spot
at the trough, right?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.687
Even Sergeant Dickhead
over here.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.190
You have to drink something.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.626
- It's a hot one.
- Yeah.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.396
Okay.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.676
<i>Why didn't you tell me
about this, John?</i>

34:37.709 --> 34:39.111
I don't know.

34:40.846 --> 34:41.847
I'm such an idiot.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.650
I just--I thought if I--

34:44.683 --> 34:46.084
if I kept it all a secret,

34:46.118 --> 34:49.087
then eventually,
it would just...

34:49.121 --> 34:50.155
go away.

34:50.189 --> 34:51.790
That's the logic
of a five-year-old.

34:51.824 --> 34:53.492
I'm-I'm-I'm your wife.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.827
<i>That's not really
how this works.</i>

34:54.860 --> 34:57.229
I know. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.498
Okay, so this
investigative report

34:59.531 --> 35:00.799
that Haldeman
wants you to write--

35:00.833 --> 35:04.203
<i>I told you
the report is a sham.</i>

35:05.304 --> 35:08.841
If I write it,
I am the first official

35:08.874 --> 35:11.276
with knowledge of the cover-up
to lie about it publicly.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.344
That is what they want.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.745
They wanna pin it on me

35:13.779 --> 35:16.748
so that they can squash
any more investigations.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.650
What happens
if you refuse to do that?

35:20.352 --> 35:23.288
Th-they'll draw and quarter me
in the press.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.456
They'll destroy me.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.525
You don't know
what kind of tools

35:26.558 --> 35:28.393
they have
at their disposal, Mo.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.795
I should know, I've used them.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.865
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.233
I know I let you down. I-I'm--

35:34.266 --> 35:35.434
I-I didn't mean
to keep things from you.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.469
I just--it all got out of hand.

35:37.503 --> 35:38.537
Okay.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.808
I'm only gonna say this
one time, okay?

35:42.841 --> 35:46.378
You cannot ever do this
to me again, ever.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.647
I know.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.383
Okay.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.419
Now, you obviously
can't write that report,

35:54.453 --> 35:56.421
and we cannot let them
drag you through the press.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.823
So what's the third option?

35:57.856 --> 36:00.492
I-I can't just walk

36:00.526 --> 36:02.427
into the special prosecutor's
office.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.629
Why not?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.898
Because I'm-I'm at the center
of this thing.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.366
I'm the bad guy.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.601
Well, what if you're the guy
who saw an injustice

36:09.635 --> 36:11.370
and decided to do something
about it?

36:12.404 --> 36:14.273
Wh-what do you mean?

36:14.306 --> 36:17.376
I'm saying--okay, if you
come out against these people,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.411
these criminals,

36:19.444 --> 36:21.580
you no longer have
a legal problem, right?

36:21.613 --> 36:24.583
You have, what,
a-a-a PR problem.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.584
And you know what?

36:25.617 --> 36:26.818
I-I've spent my entire life

36:26.852 --> 36:29.588
creating versions of myself
to please people

36:29.621 --> 36:30.789
to get what I want,

36:30.822 --> 36:33.258
and what I want is for you
not to go to jail.

36:33.292 --> 36:36.228
So we just...

36:36.261 --> 36:38.397
teach you how to do that.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.898
We're gonna have you
tell the truth

36:39.932 --> 36:42.634
in a way
that America likes you.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.636
Create a version of you that
people can see themselves in.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.672
I think that's
how we win this, John.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.340
That's how we get free.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.643
You just have to trust me.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.978
Oh.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.550
I mean, do you trust me?

36:58.584 --> 36:59.585
Yes.

37:03.622 --> 37:07.225
I love you... so much.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.298
Thank you both so much
for meeting me.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.567
Oh, thank you.

37:15.601 --> 37:16.969
Um, I would offer you some,

37:17.002 --> 37:19.605
but I-I hear
that you're a vegetarian.

37:19.638 --> 37:22.240
Martha told you that?

37:22.274 --> 37:23.575
Fantastic.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.946
So, um, listen, Jay,

37:27.980 --> 37:29.648
I was surprised
when your mom mentioned

37:29.681 --> 37:31.617
that you were back
from overseas.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.754
Well, actually, I've been back
a few years now.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.389
My mother sometimes
likes to tell people

37:37.422 --> 37:38.957
from the press
I'm still fighting.

37:38.991 --> 37:41.426
You know,
exaggerate for effect.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.828
Drunks tend to do that.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.966
Um, and I have here
that your father, Clyde,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.302
divorced your mother in 1957.

37:50.335 --> 37:51.503
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

37:51.536 --> 37:54.306
I-I guess she met Mr. Mitchell
the year before,

37:54.339 --> 37:56.675
and, um, I was nine,

37:56.708 --> 37:58.510
so I-I don't really know
much about that.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.978
Okay.

38:00.012 --> 38:03.715
And, um, what can you tell me
about growing up with your mom?

38:03.749 --> 38:06.685
Um, anything will help,
um, you know,

38:06.718 --> 38:08.520
memories, anecdotes,
that sort of thing.

38:08.553 --> 38:12.791
Yeah, yeah. Uh, oof. Well...

38:12.824 --> 38:15.994
Look, there is a reason why
Martha never talks about Jay.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.362
- Well--
- It's because

38:17.396 --> 38:18.697
she left him behind
with everything else

38:18.730 --> 38:21.033
from her past
that she'd prefer to forget.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.735
- I-I'm sorry?
- Sharon--

38:23.769 --> 38:25.871
She is a selfish,
troubled woman

38:25.904 --> 38:28.740
who happened to raise
a sensitive and loving son.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.308
But I don't credit that
to her mothering

38:30.342 --> 38:31.777
any more than I credit
a hurricane

38:31.810 --> 38:33.812
for the next sunny day.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.480
Understand?

38:36.648 --> 38:38.717
Yeah.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.352
Right.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.488
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have to use the ladies' room.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.366
Sorry about that.

38:54.399 --> 38:56.668
She's just
a little protective of me.

38:56.702 --> 38:57.836
That's okay.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.738
Strong women
tend to be that way.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.643
I brought something
that I wanted to give you.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.781
It's just some things
of my mother's

39:09.815 --> 39:12.084
that I've collected
over the years.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.519
Old photos.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.088
Stuff she left behind.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.657
Uh, maybe it might help
with your book.

39:19.658 --> 39:20.625
Of course.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.627
Thank-thank you so much.
That's--

39:22.661 --> 39:24.096
So how's she doing, anyway?

39:25.464 --> 39:26.898
She's fine.

39:26.932 --> 39:30.068
Yeah, she's playing
a pretty dangerous game

39:30.102 --> 39:31.570
with the press right now,

39:31.603 --> 39:36.007
antagonizing the White House
like that, but, uh...

39:36.041 --> 39:38.777
she's tough, your mom.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.613
You know, she has a way of, um,

39:41.646 --> 39:43.014
working against herself.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.816
Yeah, that sounds like her.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.384
There are days when I think

39:46.418 --> 39:49.154
I should just move on
and cover something else,

39:49.387 --> 39:53.425
but she calls me up
and wins me over, so...

39:53.458 --> 39:57.395
Look, I know my mom
is a lot to handle...

39:59.030 --> 40:02.467
...but don't give up on her.

40:06.671 --> 40:07.973
Thank you.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.815
Martha, if we don't leave now,
we're gonna be late.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.819
Great,
it's a boarding school tour,

40:20.852 --> 40:22.454
not La Scala. Come on.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.822
Well, I have to wear it somewhere.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.824
Otherwise, it's a waste,
and you never take me anywhere.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.125
Zolton's been
waiting an hour down there.

40:27.159 --> 40:29.060
You're awfully grumpy. Up late?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.729
Not now.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.164
I'll take a number
like everybody else.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.532
What are we up to now?

40:33.565 --> 40:34.733
Don't listen
to your mother.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.568
She's full of stories.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.103
And gin.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.506
I'd have to be drunk
to put up with you.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.016
These are our social grounds,

40:51.049 --> 40:53.685
a place to relax
with new friends.

40:55.487 --> 40:58.089
- Eyes forward.
- Stop it.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.825
I'd say
they're all too young for you,

40:59.858 --> 41:01.526
but you never listen
to your wife.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.228
We are not gonna do this here.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.564
Oh, I think that one

41:05.597 --> 41:07.065
might have
her learner's permit.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.504
<i>Over this way,
you'll see the sports courts.</i>

41:12.537 --> 41:15.507
We believe a healthy body
promotes a healthy mind.

41:15.540 --> 41:18.109
Mm, maybe I should
take a lover too,

41:18.143 --> 41:19.711
take the pressure off.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.479
You're the one that
keeps creating the pressure,

41:21.513 --> 41:23.849
the one on television
every second of the day.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.016
Shh.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.084
<i>Well, I wouldn't
have to go on TV</i>

41:26.117 --> 41:27.719
if you had the guts
to speak out.

41:27.752 --> 41:30.722
Oh, God. Not this again.
I can't take it anymore.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.924
Hey.
Could you guys keep it down?

41:32.958 --> 41:34.626
Keep yourself down, buddy.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.228
- Excuse me?
- Come on, Martha.

41:36.261 --> 41:37.529
There are children here.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.064
Tell them to mind
their own damn business.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.733
Hey, pal,
might wanna handle your wife.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.602
- The hell you say to me?
- Dad.

41:43.635 --> 41:44.803
Maybe this is the reason

41:44.836 --> 41:46.605
the president canned you, asshole.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.873
How dare you speak
to my husband like that?

41:47.906 --> 41:48.874
If I can direct your attention

41:48.907 --> 41:49.941
to the field hockey area?

41:49.975 --> 41:51.009
What are you gonna do, lady?

41:51.042 --> 41:52.244
You gonna go on TV
and make a sucker

41:52.277 --> 41:53.612
out of me
like you did to your husband?

41:53.645 --> 41:56.081
Stop it. Stop it.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.084
You smug little prick.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.652
<i>Dad.</i>

42:00.685 --> 42:01.887
Oh!

42:08.059 --> 42:09.227
- Jackass.
- Jerk.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.834
You all right, darling?

42:15.867 --> 42:17.869
Mitchell. Oh!

42:17.903 --> 42:19.004
Dad?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.005
<i>Somebody get a doctor, please.</i>

42:20.038 --> 42:21.873
Somebody get a doctor.

42:21.907 --> 42:24.309
<i>What's wrong?
What's happening?</i>

42:24.542 --> 42:27.045
Just catch your breath.
Just catch your breath.

42:27.078 --> 42:29.047
<i>Daddy, what's wrong?</i>

42:29.080 --> 42:31.116
Daddy, are you okay?

42:47.666 --> 42:48.733
Fuck.

42:48.767 --> 42:49.968
They not teach you
to use a waste bin

42:50.001 --> 42:51.069
at the Academy? My word.

42:51.102 --> 42:54.205
Uh, Mrs.-Mrs. Magruder.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.641
Hello. May, uh--

42:56.675 --> 42:58.810
can we--can we help you?

42:58.843 --> 43:01.746
My husband,
he suffers from the nocturia.

43:02.314 --> 43:03.748
Um...

43:03.782 --> 43:05.083
- what?
- The what?

43:05.116 --> 43:06.284
Nocturia.

43:06.318 --> 43:08.320
It's a medical term
for an overactive bladder

43:08.353 --> 43:09.854
brought on by anxiety.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.991
So when he's nervous,
he has to pee, and so he pees.

43:13.024 --> 43:15.160
<i>But right away, he immediately
gets this burning sensation</i>

43:15.193 --> 43:16.895
like he has to go again.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.731
It's just a trick
his mind is playing on him.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.633
Uh...

43:21.666 --> 43:23.802
I'm-I'm sorry, Mrs. Magruder--

43:23.835 --> 43:25.203
Call me Gail.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.773
Uh, sure, Gail.

43:28.807 --> 43:31.042
<i>Why are you telling us this?</i>

43:31.076 --> 43:32.210
Mmm.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.915
Because ever since
the two of you amateurs

43:36.948 --> 43:39.217
have been sitting
outside of my house,

43:39.250 --> 43:42.754
Jeb has been inside going
back and forth to the restroom

43:42.787 --> 43:44.689
as if it's an Olympic sport.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.258
The poor dummy is convinced
you boys are gonna haul him off

43:47.292 --> 43:49.861
to some secret prison
in Bolivia or something.

43:49.894 --> 43:52.197
He can't stop peeing.
It's driving me crazy.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.833
Well, we sympathize
with you, Gail.

43:54.866 --> 43:58.203
But if Jeb didn't want anyone
looking over his shoulder,

43:58.236 --> 44:00.038
maybe he shouldn't have
gotten himself involved

44:00.071 --> 44:02.974
in a criminal conspiracy.

44:03.008 --> 44:04.843
You're not listening to me.

44:04.876 --> 44:08.179
My husband is not
an intelligent man.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.681
Yeah.

44:09.714 --> 44:10.982
<i>But he knows
how to do the right thing.</i>

44:11.016 --> 44:14.386
A few days ago, I was
this close to convincing him

44:14.419 --> 44:16.788
to go to talk
to the special prosecutor.

44:16.821 --> 44:19.190
And then you two boneheads
showed up.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.394
Wait a minute. You're saying--

44:22.427 --> 44:23.795
Get the fuck out of here,

44:23.828 --> 44:25.263
unless your goal
is to send my husband

44:25.296 --> 44:27.032
into a piss-induced coma!

44:33.705 --> 44:34.706
Give me a day.

44:34.739 --> 44:36.174
And if Jeb doesn't
turn himself in,

44:36.207 --> 44:38.209
you boys can camp here
all fucking month.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.182
She just took our pizza.

44:53.258 --> 44:54.692
Hello.

45:04.436 --> 45:05.937
Martha?

45:11.176 --> 45:12.744
Martha?

45:20.819 --> 45:22.821
Marty?

45:22.854 --> 45:23.988
Hey, honey.

45:25.490 --> 45:26.925
Where's your mom?

45:44.109 --> 45:45.143
Hello.

45:47.812 --> 45:48.947
Martha?

45:54.285 --> 45:55.286
Hey.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.794
<i>I, um...</i>

46:02.827 --> 46:04.295
<i>I heard that John
had an incident.</i>

46:04.329 --> 46:05.396
<i>Is he, uh...</i>

46:05.430 --> 46:08.133
Just his blood pressure.

46:08.166 --> 46:10.135
He's gonna be fine.

46:10.168 --> 46:11.436
Oh, okay.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.472
Uh...

46:14.506 --> 46:16.941
well, I spoke with Jay.

46:16.975 --> 46:18.843
He-he's doing well,

46:18.877 --> 46:20.278
and you were right
about his girlfriend.

46:20.311 --> 46:22.547
- She's--
- Why are you here?

46:22.780 --> 46:23.781
What?

46:25.350 --> 46:27.919
Why are you here in my room?

46:29.821 --> 46:31.089
Oh, well, we're-we're sup--

46:31.122 --> 46:33.424
we're supposed to work
on the book today, remember?

46:34.826 --> 46:37.228
I don't want to work
on the book today.

46:37.262 --> 46:38.363
Go away.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.267
Martha,
you can't keep doing this.

46:44.335 --> 46:47.438
The publishers are expecting
a draft by the end of the year.

46:52.110 --> 46:53.545
Okay.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.520
<i>...serious allegations
being made</i>

47:02.520 --> 47:04.122
<i>against the sitting president.</i>

47:04.122 --> 47:07.825
<i>As for a response, President
Nixon refused to comment.</i>

47:19.170 --> 47:21.372
Oh, Raymond just got

47:21.406 --> 47:24.909
his yellow belt in karate.

47:24.943 --> 47:27.478
And Tommy,
if you can believe it or not,

47:27.512 --> 47:30.415
has got another wiggly tooth.

47:31.583 --> 47:34.352
And all the nuns say that James

47:34.385 --> 47:37.222
is one of the most diligent
hall monitors

47:37.255 --> 47:39.457
they have ever seen.

47:39.490 --> 47:42.393
And Raymond's become

47:42.427 --> 47:44.429
much more direct
with the girls.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.066
Very good.
Young cadets in training.

47:48.099 --> 47:49.934
Isn't that right, Raymond?

47:54.305 --> 47:56.140
Raymond?

47:56.174 --> 47:57.242
Sorry, Gordon.

47:58.209 --> 48:01.145
He heard some news
on the radio yesterday.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.655
What news did you hear
on the radio, Raymond?

48:12.390 --> 48:14.192
<i>Go on, don't be afraid.</i>

48:16.027 --> 48:17.128
They...

48:18.396 --> 48:19.464
...they said the judge

48:19.497 --> 48:21.132
was sending you
to a bad prison...

48:22.967 --> 48:24.369
...for a long time.

48:25.970 --> 48:27.205
That's correct.

48:30.441 --> 48:33.111
I want you to come home.

48:33.144 --> 48:34.178
I know.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.015
And I want nothing more
than to be

48:37.048 --> 48:38.316
with you and your brothers.

48:38.349 --> 48:42.186
But some things are more
important than what we want.

48:43.221 --> 48:46.924
Now, place the phone down
so you can hear my voice.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.030
Back straight.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.601
When I was a boy,

48:56.634 --> 48:57.969
I was very ill.

48:59.370 --> 49:03.107
My only friend was my nanny,
Frau Teresa.

49:04.075 --> 49:08.212
One night, as I lie awake,
dying of pneumonia,

49:08.246 --> 49:11.382
she told me the story
of another sickly little boy,

49:11.416 --> 49:15.486
a boy who, from the power
of his own will,

49:15.520 --> 49:17.155
overcame death

49:17.188 --> 49:20.258
and became the leader
of her fatherland,

49:20.291 --> 49:22.193
a mighty and terrible Fuehrer

49:22.226 --> 49:24.662
whose name would echo
through time.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.332
Frau Teresa made me realize

49:27.365 --> 49:29.967
that I, too, could overcome
my own frailty,

49:30.001 --> 49:32.637
that I, too,
could choose to be strong.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.674
So hear me now.

49:36.708 --> 49:41.245
The three of you individually
are very small...

49:41.279 --> 49:44.582
but combined,
you're equal to one adult man.

49:44.615 --> 49:45.683
And with me gone,

49:45.717 --> 49:47.185
you're gonna need
to start acting like it.

49:48.586 --> 49:52.090
James, no more fear
of the dark or monkeys.

49:53.491 --> 49:57.328
Tommy, no more crying
when the phone rings.

49:59.130 --> 50:01.366
Is...

50:01.399 --> 50:04.268
prison scary, Father?

50:04.302 --> 50:06.204
Terrifying.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.375
Grown men are either compressed
into puddles of blood

50:10.408 --> 50:12.443
or molded into mountains.

50:14.078 --> 50:17.782
This will be
Father's trial by fire,

50:18.015 --> 50:21.419
a true test of my will like
nothing I've ever experienced.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.656
Is that what you want, Father?

50:30.528 --> 50:31.696
Yes, James.

50:34.198 --> 50:38.236
It is what Father has wanted
for a long, long time.

50:47.044 --> 50:49.414
Uh-

50:49.447 --> 50:50.748
You caught me.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.351
Should have got here earlier.

50:53.384 --> 50:56.154
You could've taken
the catheter out.

50:56.187 --> 50:58.523
Never understood those things. Uh...

50:58.556 --> 51:01.058
got you a little, uh--
little something.

51:01.092 --> 51:03.761
Glad to see you're, uh,
back on your feet.

51:03.795 --> 51:06.531
I came, uh, pretty much
straight here from Camp David,

51:06.564 --> 51:09.400
<i>so that's the, uh--the finest
in the gas station.</i>

51:09.434 --> 51:11.269
<i>Mo picked it out.</i>

51:15.206 --> 51:16.774
That's sweet.

51:19.410 --> 51:20.645
Um...

51:22.346 --> 51:23.781
...I heard the president
on the news

51:23.815 --> 51:26.617
saying you were gonna be
giving a report

51:26.651 --> 51:28.686
on this Watergate sideshow.

51:30.354 --> 51:32.423
Yes. About that.

51:32.457 --> 51:34.425
Uh...

51:34.459 --> 51:37.161
that is sort of why I'm here.

51:37.195 --> 51:38.296
Um...

51:40.131 --> 51:42.867
...you know, with-with
everything that's been

51:43.100 --> 51:44.335
happening, um,

51:44.368 --> 51:46.270
we thought--that is, Mo and I

51:46.304 --> 51:49.140
<i>thought that--</i>

51:49.173 --> 51:51.342
<i>that it might be best if--</i>

51:51.375 --> 51:53.578
if I explore other options.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.154
Hmm.

52:13.598 --> 52:14.899
You talked to Cox or anybody

52:15.132 --> 52:17.168
at the special prosecutor's
office?

52:18.436 --> 52:21.138
Uh, no, sir. Um, not yet.

52:21.172 --> 52:22.373
I wanted to, uh--

52:23.708 --> 52:26.377
I wanted to talk to you
before we did, out of respect.

52:26.410 --> 52:27.778
<i>You wanted to shake my hand</i>

52:27.812 --> 52:29.814
before you stab me in the back,
is that it?

52:29.847 --> 52:31.449
The ship's going down, John.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.751
And we can either
get sucked down with it

52:33.784 --> 52:35.920
or be the first ones
onto the dinghy.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.657
Hmm.

52:50.735 --> 52:52.169
You know...

52:53.738 --> 52:56.274
...I'm sorry I didn't go
to your wedding.

52:58.242 --> 53:01.345
I-I lost my appetite
for pomp and circumstance

53:01.379 --> 53:03.281
after my first marriage.

53:07.218 --> 53:08.920
They say a good marriage...

53:10.321 --> 53:11.956
...is like a garden.

53:15.393 --> 53:19.664
<i>You have to give it
attention and...</i>

53:19.697 --> 53:21.732
<i>time,</i>

53:21.766 --> 53:23.834
<i>commitment.</i>

53:26.837 --> 53:30.374
But a good marriage
will bore you to death.

53:32.677 --> 53:34.712
<i>The kind of marriage
you want...</i>

53:36.814 --> 53:38.449
<i>...you're lucky...</i>

53:39.650 --> 53:41.285
...and you're cursed...

53:42.553 --> 53:43.788
...there's nothing like it.

53:51.295 --> 53:52.797
<i>It's love.</i>

53:57.401 --> 53:58.636
<i>It's hate.</i>

53:58.669 --> 53:59.971
Mm.

54:00.004 --> 54:02.373
I wasn't expecting you home
so early.

54:03.507 --> 54:05.743
Roosevelt booked up
for the night?

54:08.779 --> 54:10.014
<i>It's fire.</i>

54:16.454 --> 54:17.555
It's fear.

54:18.756 --> 54:21.859
It's every feeling
all at the same time.

54:23.694 --> 54:27.431
Sometimes it'll feel
like an open wound.

54:27.465 --> 54:28.833
And other times...

54:31.869 --> 54:34.271
...you don't know
if it's worth it at all.

54:41.612 --> 54:42.747
I love you so much,

54:42.780 --> 54:44.715
I could claw my eyes
out of my own head.

54:47.752 --> 54:50.488
<i>Good luck, son.</i>

54:50.521 --> 54:52.423
Let's hope
you don't fuck it up.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.660
Thank you, sir.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.872
