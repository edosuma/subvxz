Hey, I just got a text from Anya

00:08.875 --> 00:12.291
saying that she is going to be coming
to our school to be an exchange student.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.625
You know, Anya, the president
of our Scandinavian fan club, Anya?

00:16.709 --> 00:18.041
The strong, blonde one?

00:18.125 --> 00:22.250

that I can't stop thinking about.

-Oh, that Anya.
-Yeah.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.625
You two were really crushing
on each other when we toured Scandinavia.

00:33.709 --> 00:37.625
Well, you know, all the long walks,
the dancing, the romantic dinners,

00:37.709 --> 00:39.125
the regular dinners...

00:39.417 --> 00:42.208
it really was the best
two-and-a-half days of my young life.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.000
Remember how bummed you were
when the tour ended,

00:44.083 --> 00:47.834
and you thought your heart
would never be... mended?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.417
That rhymed!
Wait a second,

00:50.500 --> 00:51.834
do you really care
or are you just writing a new song?

00:51.917 --> 00:53.625
-I care.
-Then what are you writing?

00:53.709 --> 00:55.709
Do you want to go on tour again or not?

00:56.375 --> 00:59.542
So she's coming all the way
to America to go to this school?

00:59.625 --> 01:00.834
And to see me.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.083
-Kevin!
-Anya!

01:36.959 --> 01:39.291
Kevin had, like,
three milkshakes for lunch,

01:39.375 --> 01:42.208

get out of here before he blows.

14:15.166 --> 14:18.041
So, unless you fellas
are going to charge me,

14:18.500 --> 14:21.417
I do have an appointment back
in the world of the normal.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.417
-[chuckles]
-Hey, Dad?

14:23.500 --> 14:25.166
-Yeah?
-Don't leave town.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.375
OK.

14:30.959 --> 14:33.083
-What are you doing?
-[sunglasses crunch]

14:33.166 --> 14:35.208
[trash can rattles]

14:40.709 --> 14:42.959
-How's it going, man?
-Not good.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.250
I can't figure out
what went wrong with me and Anya.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.333
Well, you guys were going out,
and then she broke up with you.

14:49.041 --> 14:52.625
But why? Why? Why?

14:53.458 --> 14:55.166
Everything was going so good
back in Scandinavia.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.208
Maybe you should go back
to Anya's country.

14:57.291 --> 14:59.500
No, I'd miss you guys too much.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.000
We'd miss you too.

15:02.542 --> 15:06.583
Wait a minute! If I could make it
so being here reminds her of home,

15:06.667 --> 15:08.500
maybe she'll remember
how happy we were there.

15:08.583 --> 15:12.083
You should study up on Scandinavia and do
whatever you can to make her feel at home.

15:12.166 --> 15:16.125
If I bring Norway her way,
maybe she won't go away.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.208
Thanks.

15:21.291 --> 15:22.667
[rock music playing]

15:32.250 --> 15:36.250
I'll find you,
you evil undercover paparazzi.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.625
[beeping]

15:39.709 --> 15:40.875
[rapid beeping]

15:40.959 --> 15:44.000
Oh, no, my new phone is taking pictures

15:44.083 --> 15:46.208
and uploading them
to my website by itself.

15:46.291 --> 15:51.250
[gasps]
The evil undercover paparazzi... is me!

15:51.834 --> 15:53.834
OK, when I am done with you,

15:53.917 --> 15:56.792
you are going to feel like
the perfect girlfriend for Kevin.

15:56.875 --> 16:01.625
First lesson, I am going to teach you
how to walk gracefully.

16:01.709 --> 16:03.333
Watch me.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.333
-Wow, that's beautiful.
-I know.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.625
How did you get your bones
to move like that?

16:16.709 --> 16:20.375
-Oh, you just pretend you don't have any.
-Oh!

16:26.834 --> 16:29.166
And canceling my afternoon plans.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.166
[whirring]

16:37.083 --> 16:40.291
The world's largest population of reindeer
can be found in... ?

16:40.375 --> 16:41.792
-Scandinavia!
-Bingo.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.125
-Yes!
-OK.

16:43.208 --> 16:46.709
The reindeer crossing sign
is the most popular souvenir in...?

16:46.792 --> 16:47.750
-[bell dings]
-Scandinavia.

16:47.834 --> 16:52.000
What region starts with "Sc"
and ends with "andinavia"?

16:52.083 --> 16:54.542
-Is this a trick question?
-Surprisingly...

16:54.625 --> 16:56.583
-No.
-Come on, Kevin, come on.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.917
-Scandinavia?
-Yes, yes!

17:00.000 --> 17:02.166
-[Joe] How can Anya not be impressed?
-[Nick] I don't know.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.458
-[Kevin] Hey, Joe, come here, try this.
-OK, fine.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.250
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thanks, man.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.083
This girl is his.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.041
Is this what I think it is?

17:13.125 --> 17:15.375
Yeah, lutefisk pudding.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.917
Eww!

17:18.000 --> 17:20.458
I didn't really know how to make it
so I just put some fish in a blender

17:20.542 --> 17:25.709
-and chopped, serrated, diced.
-Why would you do that?

17:27.417 --> 17:29.208
Too many scales?

17:30.208 --> 17:33.417
When you're on a date, it's always nice
to start with a compliment.

17:33.500 --> 17:38.875
For example, I might say to you,
"You have a wonderful smile."

17:38.959 --> 17:43.000
-Thank you! I have six teeth too many.
-What?

17:43.083 --> 17:45.208
-Uh, uh...
-Oh.

17:45.291 --> 17:47.959
Good, thanks.
Now you go.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.000
Go ahead, compliment me.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.750
Uh... mm-mmm.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.709
[exclaims]

17:57.750 --> 18:01.500
You have very big hands
for such a small girl.

18:02.917 --> 18:06.166
Oh, yeah? They found sharks
with less teeth than you.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.542
I mean...
I think you're really starting to get it.

18:13.417 --> 18:14.291
Let's move on.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.375
[rock music plays]

18:24.166 --> 18:25.375
Kevin?

18:25.458 --> 18:27.208
Ah-ha...

18:28.250 --> 18:29.417
Um, whoa, hey.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.458
I was gonna say
I had a surprise for you,

18:31.542 --> 18:33.500
but I think you beat me to it.

18:33.583 --> 18:37.875
-Have you seen Anya?
-As a matter of fact... I have.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.792
I turned her
into an American girl for you.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.709
Hey, Kev.
What's up, bro-ham?

18:46.792 --> 18:50.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Um, we didn't rehearse that greeting.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.417
Uh, what's with the fake dog?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.583
I'm totally allergic to real dogs,

18:53.667 --> 18:55.792
but I totally wasn't
going to let that stop me

18:55.875 --> 18:59.291
from having the totally perfect
American girl accessory.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.750
What about all the stuff we worked on?

19:01.834 --> 19:05.166
Oh, I found much better stuff
in this magazine.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.375
Anya, what happened to you?

19:09.458 --> 19:11.834
Oh, my name's not Anya anymore.
It's Kimmy.

19:12.709 --> 19:15.667
I changed it. With a little,
you know, heart over the "I."

19:15.750 --> 19:18.125
[clears throat]
Why are you dressed like that?

19:18.208 --> 19:23.208
-I wanted to make you feel at home.
-[laughs] Like my grandpa's home.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.959
-[giggles]
-Anya?

19:25.041 --> 19:27.834
Kimmy. Kimmy.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.667
Right, Kimmy. Um...

19:32.041 --> 19:34.083
I think I liked the old you better.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.542
Oh, well, I'm still the old me.

19:36.625 --> 19:41.000
But the new me
just looks fantastic in this outfit.

19:41.083 --> 19:45.208
Right, Bootsy? Yes! [giggles]
Bye.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.166
You broke Anya.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.792
[Nick]
Poor Kev. Losing Anya must really hurt.

19:59.875 --> 20:03.041
I feel terrible.
Even this ice cream tastes lousy.

20:04.041 --> 20:07.458
That's because it's the leftover
lutefisk I put in the freezer.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.625
[groans]

20:13.458 --> 20:15.208
[car zooms]

20:17.083 --> 20:18.917
Kev, Stella feels really bad.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.250
She was just trying to help
Anya become a good girlfriend.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.625
The whole fake-dog-diva thing
is Anya's deal.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.417
Guys, relax, trust me.
I am so happy

20:27.500 --> 20:30.500
I found out who the true Anya was
sooner rather than later.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.750
Can you see me with Kimmy
with a heart over the "I"?

20:33.834 --> 20:36.750
Great attitude, bro-ham.
[chuckles]

20:37.667 --> 20:41.458
Hey, guys, look who's staying
with me for the week.

20:41.542 --> 20:45.750
This is Samantha Saint Jean,
the president of your French fan club.

20:45.834 --> 20:50.208
[French accent]
Bonjour, Samantha. I love your fries.

20:50.291 --> 20:54.125
Samantha is here
for the International Mime Festival.

20:54.208 --> 20:55.792
No way!
I love to mime!

20:55.875 --> 20:58.458
Especially over here in my invisible box.

21:02.709 --> 21:05.000
[sound of door opens, closes]

21:07.834 --> 21:09.667
I am not staying here for this.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.458
Yeah, let's go get some very visible food.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.792
Really? So, we're just gonna
leave him in there?

21:17.875 --> 21:19.291
Guys!

21:23.041 --> 21:24.083
[thuds]

21:28.041 --> 21:30.667
[whistles nonchalantly]

21:31.125 --> 21:34.875
Hey, Macy, how's it going
with the paparazzi case?

21:34.959 --> 21:37.458
Oh, I found the undercover paparazzi,

21:37.542 --> 21:40.166
so you guys don't need
to think about it anymore.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.000
-All done.
-Good work, Macy.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.834
-Case closed.
-Just one more thing, Macy.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.125
OK.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.333
You know, we took one of those
unauthorized pictures

21:48.417 --> 21:49.583
from your website and blew it up.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.834
It turns out our little
undercover paparazzo

21:51.917 --> 21:54.000
accidentally took a picture of his...

21:55.166 --> 21:57.041
or her hand.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.250
Does that nail polish look familiar?

22:00.792 --> 22:02.291
Thinky Pinky Pink.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.625
A lot of girls wear Thinky Pinky Pink.

22:04.709 --> 22:06.834
-I think.
-Hmm.

22:08.500 --> 22:12.083
Well, then we took one of the pictures
and blew it up even larger.

22:12.834 --> 22:16.083
On the hand we noticed
a limited-edition Jonas fan-club ring.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.166
Know anyone who wears that ring?

22:18.458 --> 22:19.750
[Macy sighs]

22:19.834 --> 22:21.041
[high-pitched] No.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.291
Interesting.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.208
Well, then we blew up the picture
a little larger.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.041
-[sighs]
-[Joe] And we noticed

22:30.125 --> 22:35.000
-a reflection in the ring. [exclaims]
-OK, it was me.

22:35.083 --> 22:38.333
But this thing is brand new,

22:38.417 --> 22:42.166
and I didn't know how to use it.
Please don't hate me.

22:42.250 --> 22:45.417
Don't worry. We know you would never
do anything like this on purpose.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.750
And I guess this is what happens when...

22:49.959 --> 22:52.166
you don't read your instruction manual.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.208
What are you doing?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.333
-[clattering]
-[grunts]

22:56.417 --> 22:57.542
-[crunching]
-[grunts]

22:59.917 --> 23:00.875
Ahh...

23:02.917 --> 23:04.834
-[sighs]
-I guess you could call

23:04.917 --> 23:10.709
what I just did to your glasses a real...
eye opener.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.500
You're right.
This is fun.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.041
You're not as cool as me.

23:20.917 --> 23:23.000
But... yeah.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.083
Totally.

23:25.542 --> 23:26.625
Do you have any glasses?
