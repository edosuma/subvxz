00:01.078 --> 00:03.679
Previously on <i>Human Target...</i>

00:11.238 --> 00:12.655
Good afternoon.

00:12.722 --> 00:15.164
<i>I think, with your friends'</i>
<i>welfare on the line,</i>

00:15.264 --> 00:17.282
you give me
exactly what I want.

00:24.273 --> 00:26.141
Winston?

00:26.225 --> 00:27.392
You know what to do,
right?

00:27.443 --> 00:28.927
Gonna get him back.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.435
Well, Mr. Winston...

00:39.405 --> 00:41.990
You look very presentable.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.494
I am sorry...
That it had to come to this.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.829
What you had to go through
these last 48 hours

00:47.914 --> 00:49.948
in order to tell me
the truth...

00:52.969 --> 00:54.903
I just can't help
but think

00:54.971 --> 00:56.922
how much better your life
would have turned out

00:56.973 --> 01:00.475
if you'd never met
Christopher Chance.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.230
Enough chitchat.

01:05.297 --> 01:08.316
Let's go get my book.

01:13.806 --> 01:14.823
Next.

01:17.193 --> 01:18.360
<i>How can I help you,</i>
<i>sir?</i>

01:18.444 --> 01:20.529
Morning...Denise.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.497
I'd like to make
a withdrawal.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.650
Certainly.
I can help you with that.

01:25.702 --> 01:27.035
<i>How much?</i>
Uh...Everything.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.121
I'd like to close
my account.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.039
Sorry to hear that.
May I ask why?

01:31.124 --> 01:32.624
Well, I'm gonna be
leaving town

01:32.675 --> 01:35.177
for a little while.

01:37.513 --> 01:41.016
Relax. I'm one of
the good guys.

01:44.137 --> 01:45.670
<i>Chance, they're comin' out.</i>

01:48.524 --> 01:50.726
Denise, would you be a doll

01:50.793 --> 01:52.844
and reach under the counter
and trip the alarm, please?

01:52.895 --> 01:53.845
<i>What's up, bro?</i>

01:53.896 --> 01:54.980
Can't let him get to the door.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.565
<i>This could get messy.</i>

01:59.368 --> 02:01.820
Denise, I'm not
gonna shoot you.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.107
Just reach under the counter
and trip the alarm, please.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.195
What happened?
Where's the sound?

02:10.246 --> 02:12.347
It's a silent alarm.
You're kidding me.

02:12.415 --> 02:14.299
Well, now that you got
what you came for,

02:14.366 --> 02:17.002
answer me one question.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.536
What the hell
is in that book?

02:18.588 --> 02:19.888
Secrets, Mr. Winston,

02:19.972 --> 02:22.507
things the world
does not need to know.

02:22.558 --> 02:26.228
Come on, dude.
It's now or never.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.183
Stay down!

02:31.234 --> 02:33.218
What the hell's going on?

02:33.269 --> 02:35.437
These guys are trying
to rob the place.

02:35.521 --> 02:37.939
<i>Keep them covered.</i>

02:38.024 --> 02:39.891
Mr. Chance!

02:39.942 --> 02:41.392
I was expecting you.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.394
Don't do anything stupid.

02:43.446 --> 02:46.198
Just wanna show you something.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.740
<i>So...</i>

02:55.792 --> 02:57.676
You're gonna put
your guns down.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.129
And we're gonna walk
outta here with my book.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.800
Or you'll be picking up
pieces of him for weeks to come.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.552
Winston...

03:07.603 --> 03:09.471
I'm sorry for getting you
into this mess.

03:09.555 --> 03:11.556
<i>Sorry for whatever torture</i>

03:11.607 --> 03:15.560
you had to endure
because of me.

03:15.611 --> 03:18.830
<i>Most of all...</i>

03:18.898 --> 03:21.817
I'm sorry about
Aunt Suzy.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.401
Aunt Suzy?

03:24.904 --> 03:27.939
Oh, man...
Not aunt Suzy.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.558
You got him?
Yep.

03:32.461 --> 03:34.396
Aah!

03:36.632 --> 03:38.083
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:40.168
<i>Put 'em on the floor!</i>

03:40.253 --> 03:41.920
<i>Down. Put 'em down!</i>

03:43.339 --> 03:45.590
Ehh!

03:45.641 --> 03:46.808
Stop, dude!

03:50.096 --> 03:51.646
Drop 'em!

03:52.815 --> 03:55.466
Smart.

03:55.518 --> 03:57.235
You gotta get this thing
off me, man.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.436
I don't wanna die.

04:00.189 --> 04:01.806
You know how
to diffuse it?

04:01.858 --> 04:05.193
No.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.978
Either way,
this is good-bye.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.697
What?

04:10.032 --> 04:12.083
You ready?

04:12.151 --> 04:13.651
I'm ready.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:36.008 --> 04:37.976
Chance.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.144
Chance!

04:39.195 --> 04:40.345
We gotta get out of here.

04:40.396 --> 04:42.013
Wait! Where's Chance?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.281
That's it for Chance,
bro.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.515
What are you talking about?

04:44.567 --> 04:45.850
What do you mean?
He's gone.

04:45.902 --> 04:47.518
Dude got too attached.

04:47.570 --> 04:49.354
That's the last you're
ever gonna see of Chance.

04:49.405 --> 04:52.157
Come on.
Come on.

04:58.414 --> 05:01.216
Come on, Winston.
Let's get outta here.

05:12.428 --> 05:15.313
<i>Left you too, huh?</i>

05:22.071 --> 05:24.906
You boys looking for
protection?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.158
We're looking for
Christopher Chance.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.444
Gone.

05:29.528 --> 05:33.031
When will he be back?

05:33.082 --> 05:34.916
Well, that's a good question.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.672
I work for a single employer,
a person of great means,

05:40.739 --> 05:43.174
who is in need
of Mr. Chance's rather...

05:43.242 --> 05:45.460
Specific services.

05:45.544 --> 05:47.212
Any idea
where I might find him?

05:47.279 --> 05:50.749
I don't think
you're gettin' it.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.817
You see,
when I say he's gone,

05:52.885 --> 05:54.752
I don't mean he's down
in Florida taking some R&R

05:54.804 --> 05:57.055
shacked up with a lady
friend somewhere.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.556
I mean gone.
Forever.

05:58.607 --> 06:00.959
Might as well be dead.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.527
You could search
the end of the earth,

06:02.594 --> 06:04.279
and you wouldn't
find him.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.596
Got that?

06:05.648 --> 06:07.232
My employer's
very persistent.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.901
Thank you.

06:09.952 --> 06:13.071
We'll be sure to check
the end of the earth.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.276
Wiseass.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.462
Wow.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.864
I'll give it to you,
Mr. Chance.

07:46.916 --> 07:48.466
When you say
you want to disappear,

07:48.534 --> 07:50.201
you really commit.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.303
<i>It's taken me six months,</i>

07:52.371 --> 07:53.638
an embarrassing
amount of money,

07:53.705 --> 07:55.039
and more time
in a helicopter

07:55.091 --> 07:58.259
than I ever dreamed
my ass would spend.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.762
So I have one thing
to say to you.

08:00.846 --> 08:03.064
You'd better be worth it.

08:51.533 --> 08:53.600
a very bumpy
helicopter ride,

08:53.809 --> 08:56.310
I have to tell you that
I'm out of the protection game.

08:56.395 --> 08:58.813
- I'm retired.
- Yes, so I've been told.

08:58.897 --> 09:01.699
It's a 30-hour flight home.

09:03.452 --> 09:04.652
<i>All I'm asking</i>

09:04.736 --> 09:05.936
is a few minutes.

09:09.172 --> 09:11.039
You get two minutes.

09:11.090 --> 09:12.307
Eight months ago,

09:12.374 --> 09:13.842
my husband was killed
in a plane crash,

09:13.893 --> 09:15.927
and I believe
he was murdered.

09:16.012 --> 09:18.046
My husband's name
was Marshall Pucci.

09:19.682 --> 09:20.715
You've heard of him.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.651
Software billionaire.
Philanthropist.

09:22.718 --> 09:24.936
Runs the world's
largest charity.

09:25.021 --> 09:27.656
I haven't always lived
in an ashram.

09:27.723 --> 09:29.107
Well, along with
his fortune,

09:29.192 --> 09:31.059
I've also inherited
his enemies.

09:32.578 --> 09:34.863
<i>Mrs. Pucci, I'm sure</i>
<i>your husband was a good man,</i>

09:34.914 --> 09:36.665
but if you'd done
your research,

09:36.732 --> 09:37.949
you'd know that I'm...Not.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.418
Well, I know that
Christopher Chance

09:39.502 --> 09:41.402
isn't your real name.

09:41.454 --> 09:42.821
I know that you used
to be an assassin,

09:42.889 --> 09:44.405
and I also know
that you're the person

09:44.457 --> 09:45.907
people come to
as a last resort.

09:45.958 --> 09:47.209
Charming as Nepal is,

09:47.260 --> 09:48.927
I wouldn't be here
if I had any other choice.

09:49.011 --> 09:50.295
You have other choices.

09:50.379 --> 09:52.464
There's a variety of other
people you could have hired.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.082
Yes, I have.
All of them.

09:54.133 --> 09:56.852
Now I can't leave the house
without 20 bodyguards.

09:56.919 --> 09:58.470
<i>The windows in my home</i>
<i>are sealed shut</i>

09:58.554 --> 10:00.856
<i>with bulletproof glass--</i>
<i>I don't want to live like that.</i>

10:00.923 --> 10:04.592
I want someone who's going
to put me in the line of fire...

10:04.644 --> 10:07.595
Risk my life so that
I can have it back.

10:07.647 --> 10:09.164
Right. I don't know
how you found me here

10:09.232 --> 10:10.398
or who you spoke to--

10:10.450 --> 10:11.983
I'm actually kind of
curious about that--

10:12.051 --> 10:14.102
but you should know the people
who go into business with me

10:14.153 --> 10:16.538
have a tendency
to get shot at, tortured,

10:16.605 --> 10:17.823
or...worse.

10:17.907 --> 10:19.040
I'm not afraid.

10:19.108 --> 10:20.659
That's what they all say.

10:20.743 --> 10:22.110
I'm not like
your other clients.

10:22.161 --> 10:24.445
Your two minutes are up.

10:24.497 --> 10:26.998
I can't imagine what brings
a man like you to an ashram.

10:27.083 --> 10:31.619
But I hope you find whatever
it is you're looking for.

10:31.671 --> 10:34.339
Thank you for your time.

10:34.423 --> 10:36.842
You know,
I thought you'd be different.

10:36.926 --> 10:37.859
- Taller?
- No.

10:37.927 --> 10:40.795
- Younger?
- No. Braver.

10:49.438 --> 10:51.523
Mrs. Pucci.

10:54.310 --> 10:56.945
Did you say private plane?

11:20.970 --> 11:22.521
Mrs. Pucci,

11:22.605 --> 11:24.272
this is
Laverne Winston.

11:24.340 --> 11:27.609
His former partner
before he went on vacation.

11:27.676 --> 11:29.394
Pleasure.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.701
<i>I apologize for the condition</i>
<i>of our office, Mrs. Pucci.</i>

11:36.786 --> 11:38.820
We recently had a break-in--
it's been six months.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.455
You haven't replaced
the windows yet?

11:41.958 --> 11:44.376
You have to excuse
my partner.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.111
He doesn't really comprehend

11:46.179 --> 11:47.879
the basic principles
of business.

11:47.947 --> 11:51.750
<i>You see, when the asset</i>
<i>just runs off to an ashram,</i>

11:51.834 --> 11:54.085
<i>well, then</i>
<i>there are no clients</i>

11:54.170 --> 11:55.420
<i>and therefore no revenue,</i>

11:55.504 --> 11:56.721
and thus, no windows.

11:56.806 --> 11:58.974
Except now you do
have a client.

12:00.059 --> 12:02.344
Yes, of course.
So Mrs. Pucci,

12:02.395 --> 12:04.563
tell us, why do you think
someone's trying to kill you?

12:04.647 --> 12:07.148
I was in Geneva
on my way to Africa

12:07.216 --> 12:09.067
when my husband called
at the last moment

12:09.135 --> 12:10.936
and told me not to come.

12:11.003 --> 12:13.688
He...hired Peter here
to watch over me.

12:13.739 --> 12:15.023
<i>I thought he was</i>
<i>being paranoid.</i>

12:15.074 --> 12:17.943
The last conversation
we had was an argument

12:18.027 --> 12:19.511
over my security.

12:19.579 --> 12:20.762
Anything since?

12:20.830 --> 12:23.248
Several weeks back,
she had a tail.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.467
When we tried to approach
the target, he fled the scene.

12:25.534 --> 12:27.118
Killed one of my men.
Professional hit.

12:27.203 --> 12:28.837
Okay. This doesn't make
any sense.

12:28.904 --> 12:30.538
What part?
Well, all of it.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.123
This guy couldn't have
been a pro if you spotted him,

12:32.191 --> 12:34.709
but now we're saying your man
was killed by a rank amateur.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.512
I assure you, if anyone
can take out one of my men,

12:37.579 --> 12:38.713
he's a professional.

12:38.781 --> 12:40.515
Maybe he wanted us
to find him.

12:40.582 --> 12:41.716
Exactly.
Why?

12:41.767 --> 12:43.602
Isn't that your job now?
Fair enough.

12:43.686 --> 12:46.104
So why would an assassin
want to be discovered?

12:46.188 --> 12:48.056
Your thoughts.

12:49.191 --> 12:51.943
Let us meditate on that.

12:52.028 --> 12:53.645
<i>In the meantime,</i>

12:53.729 --> 12:55.981
we're going to have to
get you exposed to the public,

12:56.065 --> 12:57.832
Mrs. Pucci,
get you out from behind

12:57.900 --> 12:59.284
that bulletproof glass
and security

12:59.352 --> 13:00.702
and see if the threat
re-emerges.

13:00.769 --> 13:03.038
Well, my husband and I
usually throw a...

13:03.105 --> 13:05.323
An annual charity event
at this time of year,

13:05.408 --> 13:07.242
and it's been vital
to the organization.

13:07.293 --> 13:08.910
Great.
We'll throw a party

13:08.961 --> 13:10.495
and pray somebody
tries to kill you.

13:10.579 --> 13:12.797
<i>Mrs. Pucci, this is</i>
<i>a terrible idea.</i>

13:12.865 --> 13:14.332
You'll be exposed
to countless threats,

13:14.417 --> 13:15.550
and that's just the guests.

13:15.617 --> 13:16.885
Exactly.
We'll just open the door

13:16.952 --> 13:18.219
and let the rats
come running right in.

13:18.287 --> 13:20.171
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but there's no way</i>

13:20.239 --> 13:21.723
that just the two of you
can guarantee her safety

13:21.790 --> 13:23.558
from hundreds
of possible assailants.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.510
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>That's...ridiculous.</i>

13:25.594 --> 13:28.313
It won't just be
the two of us.

13:28.397 --> 13:30.899
We got another guy.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.440
Talk.

13:40.242 --> 13:42.110
For you, bro,
always available.

13:42.161 --> 13:44.996
Just...gotta move
some things around.

13:45.081 --> 13:46.981
Hey, dude, welcome back.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.917
Good to have you home.

13:51.871 --> 13:53.755
♪ ♪

13:53.822 --> 13:55.590
♪ I don't need to exist ♪

13:58.627 --> 14:01.129
♪ dripping blue blood
from my wrist ♪

14:01.180 --> 14:02.797
♪ I don't need to resist ♪

14:05.267 --> 14:07.402
Well, today's your
lucky day, dude.

14:20.516 --> 14:26.287
♪ ♪

14:27.540 --> 14:29.207
It's like a damn
security convention

14:29.291 --> 14:30.909
in this hotel.
It's fine.

14:30.993 --> 14:32.043
Any hitter worth his salt

14:32.128 --> 14:33.361
will have no problem
getting in here.

14:33.412 --> 14:35.997
Hey, you got that little, um...
Oh, yeah.

14:37.466 --> 14:40.034
There's the guest
of honor.

14:43.639 --> 14:46.007
<i>Mrs. Pucci.</i>

14:46.058 --> 14:47.509
Nice dress.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.894
It's gonna make
targeting you a breeze.

14:49.979 --> 14:51.813
I'm just trying
to make your job easier.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.482
So...How does this work?

14:54.550 --> 14:55.900
Well, I'm not a big fan
of game plans.

14:55.985 --> 14:57.068
I kinda like to wing it.

14:57.153 --> 14:58.686
But if you just remember
one simple rule,

14:58.754 --> 14:59.854
everything's gonna be okay.

14:59.905 --> 15:01.322
And what rule is that?

15:01.390 --> 15:02.323
Do exactly what I tell you.

15:02.391 --> 15:04.609
Not exactly
my strong suit.

15:04.693 --> 15:06.861
And it's okay
to be afraid.

15:06.912 --> 15:08.062
Of course I'm afraid.

15:08.114 --> 15:10.331
What sane person
wouldn't be slightly worried

15:10.399 --> 15:12.283
about being killed?

15:12.368 --> 15:14.119
Oh, I see.
You're not scared at all.

15:14.203 --> 15:16.004
Do you want me to think
you're that brave?

15:16.071 --> 15:17.205
No.

15:17.273 --> 15:20.008
Everyone's afraid to die,
Mr. Chance.

15:21.761 --> 15:23.261
Unless, of course,
for some reason

15:23.345 --> 15:26.631
they think
they deserve it.

15:26.715 --> 15:29.267
Ilsa. My lord,
this is ridiculous.

15:29.351 --> 15:30.802
The party's gonna be
hell on my nerves.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.520
Listen, we need to go over
some ground rules right now.

15:32.588 --> 15:33.921
Shelly, this is...

15:33.973 --> 15:36.391
Her new man.
You're the bodyguard.

15:36.442 --> 15:37.809
Yeah, Pete told me.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.260
I'm in the loop
on everything.

15:39.311 --> 15:41.029
Shelly's
my husband's lawyer.

15:41.096 --> 15:42.614
Um...And your lawyer.
As well.

15:42.698 --> 15:44.115
So listen,
there's gonna be

15:44.200 --> 15:45.900
major players
here tonight, okay?

15:45.951 --> 15:48.486
I need you to be accessible.
I need you to be charming.

15:48.571 --> 15:49.904
I need you to be...You.

15:49.955 --> 15:51.289
I think I can manage that.

15:51.373 --> 15:52.740
<i>Shelly...</i>

15:52.792 --> 15:54.042
You can relax.

15:54.109 --> 15:55.293
Uh, not gonna happen.

15:55.377 --> 15:57.629
You pay me a fortune
to be a nervous wreck, so...

16:00.466 --> 16:02.300
Oh, it's okay.
He's with me.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.087
'Sup, bro?

16:06.138 --> 16:07.222
Hey. M14?

16:07.289 --> 16:08.923
.308.
Nice choice.

16:08.974 --> 16:10.258
So what's the plan?

16:10.309 --> 16:11.559
Gonna parade her
around the party,

16:11.627 --> 16:13.428
see if anybody
tries to kill her.

16:13.479 --> 16:14.479
Beautiful. Perimeter?

16:14.563 --> 16:15.730
Basic in and out.

16:15.797 --> 16:17.182
Sweet ice.

16:17.266 --> 16:21.186
Hot. See why
someone wants her dead.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.904
That's Guerrero.

16:22.971 --> 16:24.105
He's got a dark
sense of humor.

16:24.156 --> 16:25.490
Shall we, Mrs. Pucci?

16:34.667 --> 16:37.418
Lovely to see you.
Thank you for coming.

16:37.486 --> 16:39.838
Excuse me!

16:39.922 --> 16:43.007
What the hell's going on here?
Why are you letting

16:43.092 --> 16:45.126
these guests in
without checking their I.D.?

16:45.177 --> 16:47.345
What, they tell you their name,
and that's good enough?

16:47.429 --> 16:48.796
I wasn't told
to check for I.D.

16:48.848 --> 16:52.016
Some things are implied
in the job description.

16:52.101 --> 16:54.018
Wait a second.
This list is just names.

16:54.103 --> 16:55.270
No photos?

16:55.337 --> 16:57.021
This is the list
I was given.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.140
It's not your fault,
but it is someone's fault.

16:59.191 --> 17:01.392
I'm gonna go upstairs and find
out what the hell is going on.

17:01.477 --> 17:03.645
I.D. Everyone.
Got it?

17:05.681 --> 17:07.482
Eyes open, everybody.

17:07.532 --> 17:11.152
<i>The rat might have</i>
<i>just taken the cheese.</i>

17:22.164 --> 17:23.882
<i>The perp is female.</i>

17:23.965 --> 17:28.670
<i>Early 20s, blond hair,</i>
<i>5'3" in a security uniform.</i>

17:28.721 --> 17:31.756
<i>Keep your eyes open.</i>

17:31.840 --> 17:32.873
Got it.

17:32.925 --> 17:34.875
What's wrong?
Good news.

17:34.927 --> 17:36.644
Somebody here
wants to kill you.

17:46.155 --> 17:48.189
Okay, so now what?

17:48.240 --> 17:49.482
Have you spotted
the person in the room?

17:49.622 --> 17:51.072
Are they here?

17:51.123 --> 17:52.740
Remember the first thing
we talked about,

17:52.792 --> 17:53.758
the one rule?

17:53.843 --> 17:55.293
Doing everything
you tell me.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.712
So tell me,
what do I do?

17:57.763 --> 17:59.013
We mingle.

18:07.690 --> 18:09.858
Mrs. Pucci.

18:13.445 --> 18:15.530
<i>I just want to say</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

18:15.597 --> 18:17.565
<i>The hospital your husband</i>
<i>built in Karachi</i>

18:17.616 --> 18:20.068
saved thousands of lives,
including my own child.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.569
I am forever in your debit.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.154
<i>That means</i>
<i>so much to me.</i>

18:23.239 --> 18:24.205
Thank you so much.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.992
Ah.
You speak punjabi?

18:28.077 --> 18:29.911
Yeah. Just enough
to order a samosa.

18:29.962 --> 18:32.080
Winston, check him out.

18:32.131 --> 18:35.116
That man's a poor villager.
Your hospital's in Pakistan.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.501
His dialect was
from Afghanistan.

18:36.585 --> 18:37.669
You see the shoes?

18:37.753 --> 18:38.920
A little excessive
for a poor villager.

18:38.971 --> 18:40.088
You think
he wants to kill me

18:40.139 --> 18:41.222
because of his shoes?

18:41.290 --> 18:42.473
It's just my process.

18:42.558 --> 18:44.092
It's nice of you to open
up a hospital, though.

18:44.143 --> 18:45.643
That's a pretty dicey
area.

18:45.728 --> 18:47.478
First we overthrew
the local mullah,

18:47.563 --> 18:49.514
instituted a new regime,
then we built the hospital.

18:49.598 --> 18:53.101
How'd you do that?
We all have a process.

18:53.152 --> 18:54.986
<i>Ilsa.</i>

18:55.070 --> 18:57.021
I need to introduce you
to someone.

18:57.106 --> 18:58.523
Filthy rich.

18:58.607 --> 18:59.908
Ilsa, this is Lars Nielsen.

18:59.975 --> 19:01.159
Very pleased to meet you.
And this is...

19:01.243 --> 19:02.994
Melinda Wilson.
Pleasure.

19:03.078 --> 19:04.746
I can't tell you
what an honor it is

19:04.813 --> 19:07.248
to meet you--everything
about you I love.

19:07.316 --> 19:09.033
No, seriously,
your fashion sense,

19:09.118 --> 19:10.335
your generosity.

19:13.655 --> 19:15.006
<i>Pakistani guy's clean.</i>

19:15.090 --> 19:17.258
He was born in Afghanistan.
Shoes are his brother's.

19:17.326 --> 19:19.794
Meeting you is
a really big deal for me.

19:19.845 --> 19:21.596
<i>Oh, it's lovely</i>
<i>to meet you too.</i>

19:21.663 --> 19:22.881
Let's go.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.132
Brunette.

19:24.183 --> 19:26.067
<i>Gray dress.</i>
<i>That's your security girl.</i>

19:26.135 --> 19:27.936
<i>Grab her.</i>
<i>Be careful.</i>

19:30.172 --> 19:31.806
Look at me. Focus.

19:31.857 --> 19:33.107
You all right?

19:33.175 --> 19:34.943
Apart from you
squeezing my arm?

19:35.010 --> 19:37.528
Let's dance.

19:37.613 --> 19:39.981
Listen, something has happened,
but I'm not sure what.

19:40.032 --> 19:41.816
Feel a pinprick?
No.

19:43.619 --> 19:45.787
Look, there's nothing
wrong with my arm.

19:47.623 --> 19:48.907
What about this ring?

19:48.991 --> 19:50.909
My husband gave it to me
two days before he was killed.

19:50.993 --> 19:52.744
Is there something wrong?

19:52.828 --> 19:54.379
Yes. No.

19:54.463 --> 19:55.964
Maybe.

19:56.031 --> 19:58.549
I don't know
what it is yet.

20:06.225 --> 20:08.009
Don't run.

20:08.060 --> 20:09.978
I hate it
when they make me run.

20:10.045 --> 20:12.146
Hey!

20:15.384 --> 20:16.935
East staircase.

20:17.019 --> 20:18.436
Moving fast.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.189
You sayin' you need
a little help there, Winston?

20:21.256 --> 20:24.025
<i>I'm simply describing</i>
<i>the perpetrator</i>

20:24.076 --> 20:26.861
and approximate speed
of travel, wiseass.

20:26.912 --> 20:28.579
<i>I'll get her.</i>
<i>Yeah, no doubt.</i>

20:28.664 --> 20:30.531
If she stops for a bite to eat,
you'll catch her.

20:30.582 --> 20:32.083
Hey--freeze!

20:35.004 --> 20:36.287
That was a warning shot.

20:36.355 --> 20:38.623
You take another step,
it'll be your last.

20:38.707 --> 20:41.709
Help! I think that guy's
trying to kill me!

20:43.762 --> 20:45.763
Get out of the way!

20:51.270 --> 20:53.054
Are you security?

20:53.105 --> 20:55.223
Oh, my God, there's a guy coming
down the stairs right now.

20:55.274 --> 20:56.941
He's got a gun.
I think he's trying to kill me.

20:57.026 --> 20:58.393
Oh, my God, w-where?
Back there?

20:58.444 --> 20:59.894
Uh-huh.

21:06.452 --> 21:10.204
Hey, you didn't...

21:10.272 --> 21:13.124
I didn't...
Need your help.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.375
Course not.

21:14.443 --> 21:16.160
<i>We got her.</i>

21:16.245 --> 21:18.446
We may have the suspect.

21:22.468 --> 21:24.585
<i>Found a pink diamond</i>
<i>on the girl.</i>

21:28.290 --> 21:29.590
<i>It's Ilsa's ring.</i>

21:29.641 --> 21:31.259
<i>The girl must have</i>
<i>switched them out.</i>

21:31.310 --> 21:32.477
<i>Question is why.</i>

21:45.657 --> 21:46.607
Get down.

21:53.832 --> 21:55.616
They're not hitting
anything.

21:55.667 --> 21:56.918
Isn't that a good thing?

21:56.985 --> 21:58.953
Get down!
Are you mad?

22:00.456 --> 22:01.873
Either the sniper is blind

22:01.940 --> 22:03.324
or he's not trying
to kill you.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.658
You all right?

22:04.710 --> 22:06.627
Chance, we gotta
get her out of here!

22:06.678 --> 22:09.263
That's exactly what they want.
This is some kind of diversion.

22:09.331 --> 22:12.166
We can't risk your life
on his guess.

22:12.217 --> 22:14.435
<i>Ilsa, the safest place</i>
<i>for you to be right now</i>

22:14.503 --> 22:17.171
is right here.

22:17.222 --> 22:18.556
Let's go.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.177
Hold it right there!
Whoa, whoa.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.484
<i>I've lost Ilsa.</i>
<i>She's in the elevator.</i>

22:29.535 --> 22:30.735
On it.

22:39.128 --> 22:40.411
Guerrero, talk to me.

22:40.496 --> 22:42.663
<i>What happened?</i>

22:48.220 --> 22:50.171
They got her, dude.

22:50.222 --> 22:52.090
<i>Chance, they got her.</i>

23:21.625 --> 23:23.659
Nice digs.

23:25.295 --> 23:27.413
So what's the deal here?

23:28.828 --> 23:31.196
You guys aren't cops.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.915
You're above the law?

23:35.551 --> 23:38.319
Seriously, I'm really digging
the whole tough guy bit.

23:38.371 --> 23:41.456
It's hot.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.375
You stole this ring
off a woman

23:43.459 --> 23:45.710
<i>who's been kidnapped.</i>

23:45.795 --> 23:48.763
How painful
do you want this to get?

23:48.831 --> 23:52.267
Okay. Look...

23:52.334 --> 23:53.835
I think you and I--

23:53.903 --> 23:56.137
we got off
on the wrong foot.

24:01.394 --> 24:03.979
What are you gonna
do with that?

24:05.848 --> 24:08.349
You gonna hit
a defenseless girl again?

24:08.401 --> 24:10.151
Huh, tough guy?

24:10.203 --> 24:14.239
You're going through what
I call the five phases of fear.

24:14.323 --> 24:16.892
Denial...Anger...

24:16.959 --> 24:21.246
Frustration, acceptance,
and eventually fear.

24:21.330 --> 24:23.048
Now, who hired you?

24:24.884 --> 24:26.218
Her name's Ames.

24:26.285 --> 24:28.753
<i>Lifted her print</i>
<i>off the ring.</i>

24:28.838 --> 24:31.089
That's some rap sheet.

24:31.173 --> 24:34.309
Almost didn't recognize you.

24:34.376 --> 24:37.378
You were arrested five times
as a juvie.

24:38.881 --> 24:40.181
Remember me?

24:40.233 --> 24:43.217
Of course.
Slowest cop on the street.

24:45.220 --> 24:48.056
Yeah, I gave you a shot
once to go clean.

24:48.107 --> 24:50.659
Let you go for a b&e.

24:50.726 --> 24:53.495
I see you've
turned out well.

24:53.562 --> 24:55.363
Yeah.

24:55.414 --> 24:56.865
You too, cop.

24:59.869 --> 25:01.202
Lose the cuffs.

25:01.254 --> 25:03.672
She'll only pick 'em.

25:03.739 --> 25:05.790
Come on.

25:05.858 --> 25:06.925
Open!

25:11.413 --> 25:13.181
Better use duct tape.

25:13.249 --> 25:15.433
We need it fast, Guerrero.

25:19.221 --> 25:21.756
Hold on.

25:21.807 --> 25:23.224
You're Guerrero?

25:23.276 --> 25:24.893
Sorry.

25:24.944 --> 25:26.761
Listen, I'm gonna have
to speed this up.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.698
Need to get to phase five
a little quicker.

25:32.485 --> 25:34.202
All right, thanks.

25:34.269 --> 25:36.071
P.D. doesn't know
anything.

25:36.122 --> 25:37.822
Car was dumped
a few blocks away.

25:37.907 --> 25:39.574
No prints.
Nothing traceable.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.376
At least we know
that they're pros.

25:41.443 --> 25:42.827
Too bad the same
can't be said about me.

25:42.912 --> 25:45.246
Hey...This wasn't
your fault.

25:45.298 --> 25:47.916
Look, I know you're trying
to be my friend right now,

25:47.967 --> 25:49.117
but it is my fault.

25:49.168 --> 25:50.835
I'm supposed to be one
step ahead of everybody,

25:50.920 --> 25:52.453
and I'm the one
who lost her.

25:52.505 --> 25:53.621
<i>We</i> lost her.

25:53.673 --> 25:55.590
We are partners,
and we will get her back.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.792
Now, what do we know?

25:57.843 --> 25:59.678
We know they don't
want her dead.

25:59.762 --> 26:01.763
They probably had the girl
switch the ring

26:01.814 --> 26:02.931
to put a tracking device
on her

26:02.982 --> 26:04.298
so they knew exactly
where she was

26:04.350 --> 26:06.267
so she wouldn't be killed
during the shooting by accident.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.269
So she has value alive.

26:08.321 --> 26:10.304
Now, what if it was
politically motivated?

26:10.356 --> 26:12.474
Her husband
does a lot of charity work

26:12.541 --> 26:14.392
in some very shady
east Africa areas.

26:14.460 --> 26:16.328
No, it's not political.
There's too many pieces.

26:16.412 --> 26:17.612
Plus, these guys
are highly funded.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.414
So it's about money.

26:19.481 --> 26:21.116
Okay, let's play it out.

26:21.167 --> 26:22.951
Can't be ransom.
Nobody to pay that.

26:23.002 --> 26:24.486
Okay. Most billionaires
don't do their banking

26:24.553 --> 26:26.771
at the local branch.
What accounts did he have?

26:26.839 --> 26:28.990
I will see what
I can find out.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.425
Also check with your guy
at SFO.

26:30.492 --> 26:31.793
See if there's
any private planes

26:31.844 --> 26:33.161
that left
in the last five hours.

26:33.212 --> 26:34.996
<i>These guys</i>
<i>aren't afraid to kill.</i>

26:35.047 --> 26:36.514
Once they get what
they need from her,

26:36.599 --> 26:38.499
she's dead.

26:38.551 --> 26:40.101
<i>Look...I want you to know</i>

26:40.169 --> 26:42.771
<i>that I'm not scared.</i>

26:42.838 --> 26:45.890
But I do have a lot
of respect for you, so...

26:45.958 --> 26:47.108
I'll talk.

26:47.176 --> 26:48.626
I know.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.795
I'm a thief, okay?

26:50.863 --> 26:53.314
I-I can steal anything.

26:53.366 --> 26:56.851
No safe I can't crack,
no wallet I can't lift.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.720
Ever since I was a kid,
my dad--

26:58.788 --> 27:00.255
I'm not interested

27:00.322 --> 27:02.690
in your pathetic,
predictable life story.

27:04.543 --> 27:07.462
Last night.

27:07.529 --> 27:09.697
I was hired
to meet that woman

27:09.749 --> 27:12.100
and switch her rings.

27:12.168 --> 27:15.153
It paid good,
and I didn't ask questions.

27:16.522 --> 27:18.173
I didn't know anything
about a kidnapping.

27:18.224 --> 27:21.542
No gunshots, no murder--

27:24.046 --> 27:25.530
I'm gonna give you
a choice...

27:25.598 --> 27:27.599
'Cause I believe in
every human being's right

27:27.683 --> 27:29.617
to being tortured
democratically.

27:29.685 --> 27:31.686
Peel your fingernails off
with this...

27:31.737 --> 27:34.539
Or shoot you
in the kneecaps.

27:34.607 --> 27:36.574
I have a preference, but
I'm gonna leave it up to you.

27:36.659 --> 27:38.610
It's your body.
I'm telling the truth.

27:38.694 --> 27:40.278
It was a clean switch.

27:40.362 --> 27:42.897
Easy gig.

27:42.948 --> 27:44.499
Okay, you know what?
You win.

27:44.566 --> 27:46.451
I'm actually scared now.

27:46.519 --> 27:48.536
All right. Hey.

27:50.423 --> 27:52.507
I won't do the fingernails.

27:54.076 --> 27:56.628
It's too gruesome.

27:56.695 --> 27:57.979
Let's just do the kneecaps.

27:58.047 --> 28:00.248
Okay?

28:00.299 --> 28:02.300
Cool with you?

28:03.636 --> 28:05.419
No, please!

28:05.471 --> 28:06.805
It--it was fat Tony!

28:06.889 --> 28:08.773
He contacted me
two days ago.

28:08.858 --> 28:10.424
Please...Don't do it.
Please.

28:10.476 --> 28:11.810
Okay.

28:11.894 --> 28:14.412
All right.
You can relax.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.448
Unless you're lying.

28:16.532 --> 28:18.650
Then you should be
sufficiently nervous.

28:24.156 --> 28:26.908
Pucci has accounts
in London, Tokyo,

28:26.959 --> 28:28.543
and Singapore.

28:28.610 --> 28:29.828
No, it's too obvious.

28:29.912 --> 28:31.579
Interpol would be
all over those banks.

28:31.630 --> 28:33.164
Yeah. What would you
need Ilsa for?

28:33.249 --> 28:35.583
<i>Hey, we got a problem.</i>

28:35.634 --> 28:38.169
Girl says fat Tony
hired her to switch the rings.

28:38.254 --> 28:39.671
I'm inclined
to believe her.

28:39.738 --> 28:40.855
Why?
He corroborate it?

28:40.923 --> 28:43.007
More or less.
Fat Tony's dead.

28:43.075 --> 28:45.193
Yeah.

28:46.595 --> 28:48.313
Okay. Thanks.

28:48.397 --> 28:51.316
Four private flights
left SFO last night.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.800
One to Aspen, two to Vegas,

28:52.852 --> 28:54.969
and one with a flight plan
to Geneva.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.321
Switzerland.

28:56.405 --> 28:59.107
Isn't that where her
husband's plane went down?

29:06.448 --> 29:08.132
Champagne?

29:13.506 --> 29:14.706
Can't tell you
how many times

29:14.790 --> 29:16.541
I've been on a private
plane with your husband,

29:16.625 --> 29:18.760
and not once did he ever
offer me a cocktail.

29:18.827 --> 29:19.928
<i>Just work, work, work.</i>

29:19.995 --> 29:21.429
Where are you taking me?

29:21.497 --> 29:23.464
Well, if I tell you,
I'd have to kill you.

29:25.334 --> 29:26.935
Sorry. Bad joke.
We're going to your bank.

29:27.002 --> 29:28.269
Need to make
a small withdrawal.

29:28.337 --> 29:29.554
London.

29:29.638 --> 29:30.972
<i>Not that bank</i>
<i>come on.</i>

29:31.023 --> 29:32.774
Think I've been
planning this all these years

29:32.841 --> 29:34.943
just to make
a few lousy million?

29:35.010 --> 29:36.945
Hardly worth my salary.

29:37.012 --> 29:38.263
I'm a Harvard graduate.

29:38.330 --> 29:40.064
Give me a little more
credit than that.

29:40.132 --> 29:42.567
<i>We're going to your other bank.
</i> What, Geneva?

29:42.651 --> 29:44.652
That's our private vault,
our personal items.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.937
<i>There's not a lot</i>
<i>of money there.</i>

29:46.005 --> 29:47.539
<i>Less than in London.</i>

29:47.623 --> 29:50.408
Besides, you'll never get in.
It's been secured with--

29:50.492 --> 29:52.343
iris scans.
I know.

29:52.411 --> 29:55.330
I haven't switched
the biometric identification.

29:55.381 --> 29:57.582
You still need both of us
to access the vault.

29:57.666 --> 29:58.833
Oh, my God.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.302
I know you haven't
updated security.

30:01.370 --> 30:03.087
<i>I hate to ruin the surprise,</i>

30:03.155 --> 30:05.857
<i>but you just...</i>
<i>Keep on prying.</i>

30:08.143 --> 30:10.711
Your husband will be
meeting us there.

30:10.763 --> 30:11.930
What?

30:12.014 --> 30:15.016
Care to reconsider
that drink?

30:20.496 --> 30:22.113
What do you wanna do
about the girl?

30:22.197 --> 30:23.442
Think she's telling
the truth?

30:23.764 --> 30:25.365
- Professional opinion?
- Yep.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.033
Cut her loose.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.234
I wouldn't do that.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.953
Need to turn her over
to the cops.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.538
Girl is unsavable.
Believe me, I tried.

30:32.606 --> 30:34.657
No cops.
Not my style.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.860
Easy, boys.

30:37.928 --> 30:39.746
<i>Word of advice.</i>

30:39.813 --> 30:42.382
Use both duct tape
and cuffs.

30:42.449 --> 30:46.919
Look, I heard you say
they killed fat Tony.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.355
That means they're
coming after me next...

30:49.423 --> 30:50.990
Clean up all loose ends.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.926
She's right.
Might wanna lay low.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.561
If I leave here, I'm dead.

30:55.629 --> 30:57.847
<i>Can I stay here?</i>

30:57.931 --> 30:59.565
Borrow a gun or something?

31:02.770 --> 31:04.737
Hell, no!

31:04.805 --> 31:05.855
Can't trust her.

31:05.939 --> 31:07.190
Oh, really?

31:07.274 --> 31:09.075
'Cause I could be
halfway home by now, cop.

31:09.142 --> 31:11.995
<i>Besides, I heard you</i>
<i>say something about a bank.</i>

31:12.079 --> 31:13.196
I'm pretty good in banks.

31:13.263 --> 31:14.664
Guys, we know
we can't trust her,

31:14.748 --> 31:16.165
<i>but she's got chops.</i>

31:16.250 --> 31:17.917
She switched out a ring right
out from underneath my nose.

31:17.985 --> 31:19.702
If we're gonna pull off
an Uncle Andy,

31:19.787 --> 31:20.920
<i>she could be useful.</i>
Uncle Andy?

31:20.987 --> 31:22.288
Cool. We're gonna need
more firepower.

31:22.339 --> 31:23.823
You do realize
this gentleman is more dangerous

31:23.874 --> 31:24.957
than the people
that hired you?

31:25.009 --> 31:26.209
I'm aware.
Good.

31:26.276 --> 31:28.461
We got an understanding.
You got a passport?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.797
How many do you need?

31:33.634 --> 31:35.518
Seriously.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.303
Uncle Andy?
I don't get it.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.372
How are you guys
related?

31:51.985 --> 31:53.453
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

31:58.992 --> 32:01.411
<i>Bienvenue,</i>
<i>mademoiselle Pucci.</i>

32:01.495 --> 32:04.530
This is so lovely,
don't you think?

32:06.667 --> 32:07.667
Ah.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.071
I've done my part.
Now it's your turn.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.522
Where's my husband?

32:29.573 --> 32:30.757
Deal's a deal.

32:36.062 --> 32:37.413
My God!

32:37.498 --> 32:39.332
Told you
he was coming.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.104
Got it.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.638
We can go now.

33:02.723 --> 33:05.358
My husband's briefcase.
That's what you were after.

33:05.425 --> 33:07.560
Like I said, Ilsa,

33:07.628 --> 33:10.062
anyone can steal
a few million,

33:10.114 --> 33:12.698
but billions...

33:12.766 --> 33:14.066
That's where it gets tricky.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.068
Inside here
is everything I need

33:16.120 --> 33:17.587
to become Marshall Pucci.

33:17.654 --> 33:20.239
Or at least
have his stuff.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.041
Deeds, titles,
account numbers,

33:22.108 --> 33:23.543
pass codes to his banks.

33:23.610 --> 33:26.278
<i>Guy never trusted anyone</i>
<i>except you.</i>

33:26.330 --> 33:28.998
Maybe he was right to be...

33:29.082 --> 33:30.616
A little suspicious.

33:43.514 --> 33:44.797
No.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.233
No what?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.569
When I walk out that door,
you have no use for me.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.687
Okay, can we just
hold off on the drama,

33:51.772 --> 33:52.855
maybe discuss this
outside?

33:52.940 --> 33:56.359
If I'm gonna die,
I want you to do it now.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.361
Kill me.

34:00.197 --> 34:01.814
What's the matter, Sheldon?

34:04.334 --> 34:05.785
You can have the title,
the deeds,

34:05.836 --> 34:07.620
all the money in the world,

34:07.671 --> 34:10.822
but you'll never be
my husband.

34:10.873 --> 34:12.675
You don't have the spine.

34:17.998 --> 34:19.498
What the hell
is she doing?

34:19.550 --> 34:20.933
She's making her stand.

34:21.001 --> 34:22.467
How do you wanna
play it?

34:22.518 --> 34:25.337
Woman refuses to do anything
the way I want her to.

34:25.389 --> 34:26.938
Switch to an Uncle Billy.

34:27.007 --> 34:28.774
Sweet.
Diggin' Uncle Billy.

34:30.176 --> 34:31.726
I hate an Uncle Billy.

34:34.014 --> 34:35.815
So if I'm just lookin'
for some club music,

34:35.866 --> 34:37.817
you know,
like, nothing too sceney,

34:37.868 --> 34:40.286
just, like, a place to chill...
<i>Just give me a couple minutes</i>

34:40.353 --> 34:43.022
<i>to get into position.</i>
Excuse me for a second?

34:43.072 --> 34:44.739
Sorry, guys.

34:44.824 --> 34:47.493
<i>Still here.</i>
<i>Not in your family.</i>

34:47.543 --> 34:49.078
What in the hell
is an Uncle Billy?

34:49.161 --> 34:51.196
Guard has an access key
to the stairwell.

34:51.248 --> 34:53.081
<i>Try and keep up.</i>

34:57.004 --> 34:59.422
<i>Bonjour, tout le monde.</i>
<i>Je vole cette banque.</i>

34:59.506 --> 35:04.043
<i>Voudrais, s'il vous plait,</i>
<i>sur la terre.</i>

35:04.094 --> 35:06.211
How hard can this be?

35:11.518 --> 35:13.719
There are four of you.
One of you shoot him.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.774
The man's got a gun.

35:33.123 --> 35:35.007
Yeah.
Slight change of plans.

35:35.075 --> 35:37.877
Need the helicopter
on the roof--now.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.912
Block him!

35:39.963 --> 35:40.963
Stay right there.

35:41.048 --> 35:42.682
Take one step, she's dead.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.967
Okay.

35:45.052 --> 35:47.737
Let's just calm down here.
We can work this out.

35:47.804 --> 35:49.221
Yes, we can.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.090
Provided you put
the gun down.

35:54.594 --> 35:56.445
Promise you won't kill her.
Sure. Absolutely.

36:05.572 --> 36:07.873
Can I just ask you
one question?

36:07.941 --> 36:09.342
What was your game plan?

36:09.409 --> 36:11.661
Or did you even...
Have one?

36:11.745 --> 36:13.579
Not crazy about
game plans.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.214
Seriously?

36:15.281 --> 36:16.615
I'm genuinely curious.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.885
You thought to come up here
by yourself and shoot us?

36:19.953 --> 36:22.221
Oh, I didn't come here by myself.
What?

36:22.288 --> 36:24.223
I brought another guy.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.225
<i>Got him?</i>

36:28.795 --> 36:30.129
Course, dude.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.347
Aah!

36:40.073 --> 36:41.157
You trust me?

36:43.110 --> 36:44.827
Yes.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.200
Sorry, Mrs. Pucci.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.785
<i>You know, normally</i>

37:25.852 --> 37:27.453
we're a lot more

After all,
you saved my life.

38:26.350 --> 38:28.369
Naw. It's all part
of the game plan.

38:28.453 --> 38:30.154
Jumping out of
a 12-story building?

38:30.205 --> 38:33.207
Game plan's
not for everybody.

38:33.291 --> 38:35.042
I'll give you some...
Space.

38:35.126 --> 38:36.827
Mr. Chance.

38:38.463 --> 38:41.165
Why do you do it?

38:41.216 --> 38:43.200
Dive out of buildings
in front of bullets,

38:43.251 --> 38:44.718
put your life on the line?

38:44.786 --> 38:47.337
It's part of the job.
It's what I'm paid to do.

38:47.389 --> 38:50.007
I don't think you do it
for the money.

38:50.058 --> 38:52.593
There's a lot smarter ways
to earn a dollar.

38:52.677 --> 38:54.194
I'm not very bright.

38:56.765 --> 38:59.416
But you are brave.

39:00.902 --> 39:03.721
You must have a lot
to be redeemed for.

39:06.741 --> 39:08.092

that can get us home.

39:19.838 --> 39:20.954
There's two connections.

39:21.039 --> 39:22.289
No connections.

39:22.373 --> 39:24.675
Okay. Oh!
Here's a 9:00 but...

39:24.742 --> 39:26.126
Oh, nothing
but middle seats.

39:26.211 --> 39:27.461
I don't do middle.

39:27.545 --> 39:28.762
Think I'm gonna
stick around,

39:28.847 --> 39:30.013
look up a few friends.

39:30.081 --> 39:31.048
Really?
Yeah.

39:31.099 --> 39:32.716
Who do you know in Geneva?

39:32.767 --> 39:34.268
Got people
everywhere, dude.

39:35.687 --> 39:37.221
Mr. Chance.

39:37.272 --> 39:38.939
Great. Here we go.

39:39.023 --> 39:41.275
You know,
I've been thinking.

39:41.359 --> 39:44.394
I could either return you
back to the ashram

39:44.446 --> 39:46.313
or to any other place
you desire.

39:46.397 --> 39:48.031
Or...

39:48.099 --> 39:49.817
Why did I think
there was another option?

39:49.901 --> 39:51.235
Or you could work for me.

39:51.286 --> 39:53.153
Not for my protection.

39:53.238 --> 39:55.739
<i>I imagine there are a lot</i>
<i>of people all over the world</i>

39:55.790 --> 39:57.074
who could use your...

39:57.142 --> 40:00.494
Specific non-game-plan
services.

40:00.578 --> 40:01.778
But I could do that
on my own.

40:01.830 --> 40:04.164
Why would I want a boss?

40:04.232 --> 40:07.317
Don't think of me as a boss.
Think of me as a benefactor.

40:07.385 --> 40:09.452
Someone to bankroll
your redemption.

40:10.755 --> 40:12.389
Besides, I've seen
your office.

40:12.456 --> 40:14.475
With me, you could do it
with a little bit more style.

40:14.559 --> 40:17.928
And your team would have access
to my planes, my cars, my purse.

40:17.979 --> 40:21.899
I-I'm sorry.
Did you say planes?

40:21.966 --> 40:24.735
<i>Man of my length can</i>
<i>appreciate private air travel.</i>

40:24.803 --> 40:26.019
Yes, I could even throw in

40:26.104 --> 40:28.489
some new windows for the office.

40:28.573 --> 40:30.357
Look, I don't know.

40:30.441 --> 40:31.942
You have my word.

40:31.993 --> 40:34.528
I would be
an absentee owner.

40:34.612 --> 40:36.530
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

40:40.952 --> 40:44.955
I was just returning
Mrs. Pucci her bracelet!

40:45.006 --> 40:46.590
I'm with these guys!

40:46.657 --> 40:48.258
<i>Part of the team!</i>

40:48.326 --> 40:50.544
Right?
Tell them!

40:58.870 --> 41:01.271
I'm sorry I left.

41:03.808 --> 41:06.693
You know,
the ashram and all that...

41:06.778 --> 41:08.929
Are you looking for
more than this?

41:08.997 --> 41:10.998
Yes.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.451
I was wrong.
That'll do.

41:17.372 --> 41:19.373
I don't know if we should
have given her carte blanche

41:19.457 --> 41:20.690
on changing the windows.

41:20.742 --> 41:24.611
I think I might have...
Wanted to have some say in that.

41:33.972 --> 41:35.639
Whoa.

41:38.910 --> 41:40.561
She went
a little overboard.

41:40.645 --> 41:43.146
Oh, I can get used to this.

41:45.733 --> 41:49.603
Only problem is all these
extra windows she put in.

41:49.687 --> 41:51.855
You've still got a lot
of enemies out there.

41:51.906 --> 41:54.408
<i>You need to stay hidden.</i>

41:54.492 --> 41:55.776
Nah.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.611
No more hiding.

41:57.695 --> 42:00.197
They can come and get me.

42:03.034 --> 42:04.668
I'm not going anywhere.
