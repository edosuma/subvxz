Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!

00:29.920 --> 00:31.797
Hey, guys!

00:49.160 --> 00:52.550
- Ho! Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
- Hey!

00:52.640 --> 00:55.598
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>can I have your attention?</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:59.116
<i>This has been our best year ever</i>
<i>thanks to Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.</i>

01:00.800 --> 01:03.872
<i>A- And I think we should give</i>
<i>a special thanks to the people...</i>

01:03.960 --> 01:06.520
<i>responsible for our</i>
<i>record-breaking sales,</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:10.229
<i>our Midwest marketing</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:12.754
- <i>Scott Calvin and Susan Perry!</i>
- Yeah!

01:12.840 --> 01:16.958
<i>Let's hear it for 'em!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

01:17.040 --> 01:20.555
<i>Susan, darling, come on up here.</i>
<i>Aren't they adorable?</i>

01:20.600 --> 01:22.989
<i>Say a few words.</i>

01:23.080 --> 01:25.674
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>This was really a team effort,</i>

01:25.720 --> 01:28.314
<i>and I would just want to thank</i>
<i>every one of you individually...</i>

01:28.400 --> 01:31.039
<i>But we don't have time</i>
<i>for that, do we?</i>

01:31.120 --> 01:33.236
<i>In all seriousness,</i>
<i>um, here at B&R Toys,</i>

01:33.280 --> 01:36.397
<i>we're not just about makin'</i>
<i>a profit in quality toys.</i>

01:36.440 --> 01:38.954
<i>We're also about families.</i>

01:39.000 --> 01:41.355
<i>But our families aren't</i>
<i>here with us right now.</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:44.995
<i>Which is probably why Johnson's</i>
<i>secretary is sittin' in his lap.</i>

01:45.080 --> 01:47.548
<i>You guys have a great party,</i>
<i>have a great year.</i>

01:47.640 --> 01:50.359
<i>Drive safe.</i>
<i>Thanks very much.</i>

01:52.680 --> 01:54.910
<i>Aren't they wonderful?</i>

01:58.000 --> 02:00.195
Laura, I was hopin' to catch you
before you'd left your house.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.070
I ran real late today. You wouldn't
believe the traffic out here.

02:05.120 --> 02:09.875
Yeah, same to you!
And that's not very ladylike!

02:09.919 --> 02:12.115
Anyway, I'll try to get
to my house as soon as I can.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.754
Oh, there's the problem right there.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.155
Three car pile-up.
I'm really gonna be late.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.910
All right. Let's go.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.673
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Neal.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.112
- Oh, sorry I'm late. Hi.
- Hi.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.993
- Did you want to come in for a minute?
- Neal's waiting in the car, so...

03:47.080 --> 03:50.914
- Why doesn't he come in?
- 'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll
just end up saying something snotty.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.754
Not necessarily. Could be rude
or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.751
- See? I gotta go. Here.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.473
Christmas Eve.
Just for a minute.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.354
Watch those steps.
They're real slippery.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.874
- Ooh!
- Told ya.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.998
- So...
- Well...

04:16.079 --> 04:18.958
- You goin' to your mom's for dinner?
- Actually, we're gonna be
with Neal's family.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.911
Ah, Christmas at the pound.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.956
There aren't that many
presents over there.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.076
Well, that's because
Santa isn't here yet.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.315
Neal doesn't believe
in Santa.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.555
Well, Neal's head
comes to a point.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.513
- He's smart. He's a doctor.
- He's not a doctor. He's a psychiatrist.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.511
Take your coat off.
You're stickin' around, aren't ya?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.630
I'll be right there.
Just a sec.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.076
- I just want to...
- Did that jerk tell Charlie
there was no Santa Claus?

04:48.120 --> 04:52.750
What? No. Oh, Charlie came home
from school the other day in tears,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.156
because some big kid told him
there was no such thing as Santa.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.356
And, you know Neal.
Well, he sat him down and...

04:58.440 --> 05:00.271
He told him that
there was a Santa Claus.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.318
Well, all he said was that
Santa was more like a feeling.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.834
You know, more like
a state of mind than a person.

05:05.880 --> 05:10.954
Kind of like Neal.
And who gave you permission
to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.436
I think if we're gonna destroy our son's
illusions, I should be a part of it.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.829
- Yeah, but you're never around,
are you, Scott?
- Oh, oh, please.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.959
Listen, all we are trying to do is
give Charlie a firm grasp on reality.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.430
That's a good idea. You don't want kids
runnin' around usin' their imaginations.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.353
Oh, yeah. This from the guy responsible
for the Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.795
- Leave her out of this.
- <i>Don't you burp me, don't you change me</i>

05:29.880 --> 05:33.111
- <i>I'm the dolly...</i>
- Why do you guys always have to fight?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.270
I, uh, swear we're not fighting.
It's your mom's singing.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.710
It sounds a lot like fighting,
doesn't it? Cats even.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.998
The trouble is, Neal and your mom,
they don't believe in Santa
because they were real naughty.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.554
Which is why they'll probably get
lumps of coal in their stockings.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.395
I don't know. It seems kind of babyish
to believe in that kind of stuff.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.631
What are you talkin' about? I believe
in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.676
- Well...
- Maybe it's time you left.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.230
We don't want to keep
Dr Pinhead waiting.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.828
Come here.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.272
Do I gotta stay?

06:08.360 --> 06:13.878
Listen, you and your daddy are
gonna have a great Christmas, okay?

06:13.920 --> 06:16.514
- Will you pick me up tomorrow?
- Of course.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.431
- Early?
- Yes.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.670
We're talking sunup?
You're here?

06:22.200 --> 06:26.352
You'll be fine. Ah, merry
Christmas, Charlie. I love you.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.510
I love you too, Mom.

06:30.040 --> 06:34.318
- You be a good boy, okay?
- Bye, Mom.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.996
Four hours?

06:44.040 --> 06:50.991
<i>I'm dreamin'</i>
<i>of a white Christmas</i>

06:51.080 --> 06:55.312
- <i>Your Christmas will be perfect...</i>
- <i>Just like the ones I used to know</i>

06:55.400 --> 06:57.834
<i>... with its own</i>
<i>built-in turkey timer.</i>

06:57.880 --> 07:01.555
<i>Where those treetops</i>
<i>glisten</i>

07:01.640 --> 07:05.155
<i>- And now, we return to the most</i>
<i>cherished of Christmas stories,</i>
<i>- And children listen</i>

07:05.200 --> 07:09.716
- Miracle On 34th Street,
<i>starring Natalie Wood and...</i>
<i>- To hear sleigh bells in the snow...</i>

07:24.120 --> 07:28.716
That is exactly why you want
a high-quality fire extinguisher
right in the kitchen.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.155
Those flames
were really big, Dad.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.198
- Yeah, turkey's funny that way.
- Dad!

07:35.040 --> 07:37.270
'Ey!

07:45.640 --> 07:47.232
It's done.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.877
You like osso buco, Charlie?
They're closed.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.918
You know, Neal's
a real good cook.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.117
Yeah, and you should see him
walk on water.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.839
- You don't like him
very much, do ya, Dad?
- Charlie, yeah...

08:02.880 --> 08:04.996
I was joking, okay? I'm sorry.
I was just kiddin' around.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.436
I like him a lo... Yeah, sure,
I like him. You know, there...

08:08.480 --> 08:11.472
There's just something
about him that makes me wanna...

08:11.560 --> 08:13.676
Lash out irrationally?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.951
- Where did you hear that?
- From Neal.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.395
I learn a lot from him.
He listens to me.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.914
Yeah. Then he
charges ya for it.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.676
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

08:32.760 --> 08:37.231
- <i>Of a white Christmas</i>
- All right. Denny's.

08:37.320 --> 08:42.188
<i>- Just like the ones I used to know</i>
- It's always open.
- I don't wanna eat here.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.430
- What are you talkin' about?
Everybody likes Denny's.
- <i>Where those treetops</i>

08:44.480 --> 08:46.357
- It's an American institution.
- <i>Glisten</i>

08:55.000 --> 08:57.230
- Are you with Hatsutashi?
- No!

08:57.280 --> 09:00.511
- Dad burnt the turkey.
- Oh, yeah. This way. Come on.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.150
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.559
- Here we go.
- Burn the turkey?

09:22.440 --> 09:27.389
- Coffee?
- No, thank you, Judy.

09:27.480 --> 09:31.712
What do you say we start out
with cold glasses...

09:31.800 --> 09:35.634
of delicious seasonal
favourite eggnog?

09:35.720 --> 09:38.359
- I don't like eggnog.
- We're out.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.749
- Coffee. Decaf.
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.349
- I'll have chocolate milk, please.
- We're out.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.637
- Plain milk's fine.
- Okay.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.678
- At least we know
they got hot apple pie.
- We did.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.990
Mm-hmm!

10:01.000 --> 10:03.389
This is nice.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.832
"And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

10:09.880 --> 10:12.474
- <i>I'm dreaming</i>
- "had just settled down
for a long winter's nap.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.994
- <i>Of a white</i>
- "When out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.548
- <i>Christmas</i>
- "I sprang from my bed
to see what was the matter.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.070
"Away to the window
I flew like a flash.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.513
"With a miniature sleigh and St.
Nich... and Prancer and Dancer...

10:26.600 --> 10:28.955
...and to all a good night."

10:36.280 --> 10:39.670
- What's that?
- What's what?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.751
"A Rose Suchak ladder"?

10:41.840 --> 10:45.435
It's not a ladder.
I said, "arose such a clatter."

10:45.520 --> 10:47.636
It means, eh,
"came a big noise."

10:47.680 --> 10:49.557
What?

10:50.840 --> 10:54.958
Charlie, "arose" is a word
that means "it came,"

10:55.000 --> 10:56.911
and "clatter"
is a big noise.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.837
Now, please, go to sleep.
Shut your eyes.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.638
How do reindeer fly?
They don't have any wings.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.076
- Fairy dust?
- That's from <i>Peter Pan,</i> Dad.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.720
- Horns.
- Antlers.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.429
Whatever.
Their, uh, antlers give them...

11:13.520 --> 11:16.478
You know, ther... ther... there's
a slipstream effect... The air go...

11:16.560 --> 11:18.391
T-They move fa...
They're weightless.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.996
- But if Santa's so fat, how
did he get down the chimneys?
- He sucks it in like Grandpa.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.271
But what about people
who don't have fireplaces?
How does he get into their house?

11:26.360 --> 11:30.797
Charlie, sometimes believing
in something means you...

11:32.960 --> 11:34.871
means you just
believe in it.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.714
Santa uses reindeer to fly because
that's how he has to get around.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.712
But you do believe
in Santa, right, Dad?

11:43.280 --> 11:47.159
Of course I believe in Santa.
Now, please, go to sleep.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.392
- Dad?
- What is it, Charlie?

11:57.440 --> 12:01.718
Maybe you better leave some cookies
and milk out, just in case, okay?

12:01.760 --> 12:05.673
Great. I'll just go
preheat the oven.

12:05.720 --> 12:09.235
And don't forget
the fire extinguisher.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.675
Good night, Charlie.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.274
Ho!

12:30.120 --> 12:32.350
Now, settle down there.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.190
Dad! Dad!

12:46.240 --> 12:49.869
- W-What?
- I heard a clatter.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.434
- What, Charlie?
- There! A clatter!

12:52.520 --> 12:56.274
- Charlie, what are you talkin' about?
- You know, "it came a big noise."

12:56.360 --> 12:58.237
It's coming from outside.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.436
Charlie, it's just
the wind or somethin'.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.080
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.508
- Somebody's on the roof.
- Maybe it's Santa.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.434
Not now, Charlie.
I want you to sit here,
and I want you to stay right there.

13:14.240 --> 13:18.756
- Charlie, do you know how to call 911?
- Sure. 911.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.229
Yeah. Great. Stay there.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.719
- Hey, you!
- What's that...

13:37.760 --> 13:41.150
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

13:57.560 --> 14:01.758
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, buddy.

14:01.840 --> 14:07.312
All right, you should
just stay still. Perfect.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.996
- You got him!
- Charlie, stay where you are.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.992
Charlie, would you listen to me?
Stay up there!

14:15.080 --> 14:18.629
It is Santa!
You killed him.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.274
Did not.
And he's not Santa.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.794
Well, he was.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.157
He's got some I.D.
On him, I bet.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.351
Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just
lookin' for your identification.

14:30.440 --> 14:35.673
Once I figure out who ya are, I'll...
I'll give you a lift back to the mall.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.150
"If something should
happen to me, put on my suit.
The reindeer will know what to do."

14:39.240 --> 14:42.471
Yeah, right.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.270
Whoa.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.512
- Dad!
- Hey.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.511
He disappeared.

15:28.600 --> 15:33.549
- Whoa!
- He's naked somewhere.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.353
- You gonna put on the suit
like the card said? Are you?
- No. No.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.716
- Come on, Dad. I wanna go too.
- Stop it, Charlie.
We're not goin' anywhere.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.112
- You never do what I wanna do!
- Would you please be quiet for a minute
so I can figure this out?

15:46.360 --> 15:50.353
Reindeer up on the roof.
Santa suit layin' on the ground.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.228
Guy fell. Not my fault.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.995
Reindeer on the roof.
That is hard to explain.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.749
It's the ladder.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.597
Where the hell'd
this come from?

16:06.680 --> 16:10.116
Look here, Dad.
"The Rose Suchak Ladder Company."

16:10.200 --> 16:14.716
- Huh?
- "Out by the roof
there's a Rose Suchak ladder."

16:14.800 --> 16:18.839
- Just like the poem.
- Just like the poem?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.673
Charlie, come on down from there.
Charlie, get down from there!

16:21.720 --> 16:25.349
Dad! You gotta see this!

16:25.400 --> 16:27.516
- Don't touch anything!
- It's great!

16:27.600 --> 16:31.309
I'm just gonna call the police.
I'll carry this stuff up there.
Let them deal with it, okay?

16:34.040 --> 16:38.033
Whoa! This guy was huge.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.111
Dad, isn't this neat?

16:40.160 --> 16:43.869
Charlie. Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.190
They're reindeer.
You don't know where they've been.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.955
They all look like
they've got key lime disease.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.796
Easy, Rudolph.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.156
Excuse me, Comet.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.993
Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.594
There's no such thing
as Santa's sleigh.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.753
- Sure there is. You said
you believed in Santa, right?
- I did? I do.

17:10.839 --> 17:15.310
What about the reindeer?
These are Santa's reindeer, aren't they?

17:15.359 --> 17:18.511
I hope not.
These are, uh,

17:21.280 --> 17:23.635
a gift.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.830
Probably from
the cable company.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.872
We're getting the Disney Channel now.
Merry Christmas.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.077
- Now, hop out of there, please.
- I don't wanna go.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.590
Listen, Charlie.
I'm not kidding. Let's go!

17:37.840 --> 17:41.389
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah! Let's go! Whoa!

17:47.520 --> 17:51.877
Charlie! Hold on, Charlie!

17:55.800 --> 17:57.392
Whoa!

18:00.200 --> 18:03.749
Giddyap, Comet!
Whoa, let's go!

18:06.960 --> 18:09.394
Dad! Climb up here!

18:10.440 --> 18:11.839
There we go!

18:11.920 --> 18:15.629
So, uh, if we go straight
on this road, and we hit I-94...

18:34.280 --> 18:37.795
Well, we made good time.
Now what do we do?

18:37.880 --> 18:40.348
- Get the bag of toys.
- And do what?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.477
- Go down the chimney.
- Down the chimney?

18:43.560 --> 18:46.199
You want me to take
the toys down the chimney...

18:46.280 --> 18:49.238
into a strange house
in my underwear?

18:49.320 --> 18:52.278
No. You gotta
put the suit on first.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.636
You know what we're gonna do
is we're gonna get outta here,

18:55.720 --> 18:59.235
because this whole thing
is stupid.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.357
How come everything
I wanna do is stupid?

19:06.280 --> 19:08.271
I didn't say that.

19:23.320 --> 19:28.030
Freezing my nubs off out here, and you
want me to get into a Santa costume.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.350
This is great.
A Santa costume.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.518
Oh, this thing.
You never know where it's been.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.636
A thousand malls.

19:36.720 --> 19:41.157
Well, I hope you're happy, Comet.
Hope you're happy. But most of all,

19:41.240 --> 19:44.516
I hope the guy that
lives here is a tailor!

19:44.600 --> 19:46.989
Nice coat.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.549
Well, how do I look? Nice?

19:51.640 --> 19:54.200
- You forgot the sash.
- You're right.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.271
This completes the ensemble.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.914
All right. Got my boots.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.952
Now I've got the suit on. How
am I supposed to know what to leave?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.833
- Maybe there's a list.
- A list. How silly of me.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.599
Of course there's a list.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.159
Careful, Dad!

20:15.240 --> 20:18.915
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay!
- Look! You're flying!

20:19.000 --> 20:21.560
It's okay. I'm used to it.
I lived through the '60s.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.874
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:08.040 --> 21:09.917
Nice teeth.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.830
Who's down there?

21:17.280 --> 21:18.918
It's the holidays.
Come on. Come on.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.269
Charlie, I need
a little help down here!

21:29.280 --> 21:33.478
Whoa! How'd you do that?
What'd it feel like, Dad?

21:33.560 --> 21:36.597
It felt like
<i>America's Most Wanted.</i>

21:36.680 --> 21:40.798
Now, pull me in, quick.
We gotta get outta here.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.792
Thanks. We gotta go home.
How do you start this thing?

21:43.840 --> 21:46.832
Just like that!

21:51.680 --> 21:54.478
Whoa!

21:54.520 --> 21:57.830
This could be
a really long night.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.873
Do it again, Dad. Please.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.077
I can't. That thing's empty.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.228
There's nothin' in the bag.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.953
Even if there was, d-didn't
you notice there's no chimney?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.355
Where there's no chimney,
there's no fireplace.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.397
Are you growling at me?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.315
Look, Comet, like I said,

22:21.400 --> 22:24.358
there is nothing left...

22:24.440 --> 22:27.637
That's so weird, 'cause
I know when I did... that...

22:27.680 --> 22:30.353
No, no, no, no, no!
Hold it!

22:30.440 --> 22:34.035
There's no chimney here. Can you
hear me? No chimney, all right?

22:34.080 --> 22:36.640
Lookin' good, Dad.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.518
You have got to be kidding!
Come on!

22:39.600 --> 22:42.114
Look at the size
of this thing.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.916
Weird! Ow!

23:00.640 --> 23:02.039
Ouch! Oh!

23:08.000 --> 23:10.833
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.559
How come your clothes
are so baggy?

23:13.640 --> 23:18.191
Because Santa is watchin'
his saturated fats.

23:18.280 --> 23:22.671
- How come you don't have a beard?
- Because I shaved!

23:22.720 --> 23:26.998
Do you want this doll or not?
Go back to sleep.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.430
You're supposed
to drink the milk.

23:34.520 --> 23:37.080
Look, I am
lactose intolerant.

23:37.160 --> 23:41.870
And I am just about this close
to taking all those presents
back up the chimney with me.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.234
"Supposed to drink the milk."

23:47.880 --> 23:49.313
Shut your eyes.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.915
Yo!

23:56.240 --> 23:58.151
How do you get in
without a fireplace?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.589
I don't know.
One just kind of appeared.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.473
Awesome!

24:10.600 --> 24:12.830
Oh, boy!

24:50.240 --> 24:53.789
Charlie, look at the clouds over here.
Aren't they pret...

24:53.880 --> 24:55.836
Charlie!

25:20.720 --> 25:23.553
All right.
Mornin', fellas.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.155
Mornin', sport.
We're done, Comet. Ho-ho-ho.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.270
Back to the house.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.670
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.558
When I wake up,
I'm gettin' a CAT scan!

25:55.440 --> 25:59.911
- Is this okay, Dad?
- No, it's not okay!

25:59.960 --> 26:04.112
Hey, does this look like home
to you guys?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.960
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

26:08.040 --> 26:11.350
Where you goin'?
Come back here! Aww!

26:18.520 --> 26:23.150
<i>In the silence of the night</i>

26:23.240 --> 26:25.708
- <i>When the snow</i>
- Hey, hey!

26:25.760 --> 26:28.399
- <i>Lies soft and still</i>
- Hey, buddy!

26:28.440 --> 26:32.991
- You, sir! Hey!
- <i>You can see a magic light</i>

26:33.080 --> 26:37.232
<i>And hear the ring</i>
<i>of Christmas bells</i>

26:37.320 --> 26:42.917
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Though the night seems long and dark</i>

26:43.000 --> 26:45.753
- <i>It is the earth</i>
- What's that?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.876
- <i>Just gone to sleep</i>
- I don't know.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.394
- I think it's the North Pole.
- <i>The stars that dot</i>

26:50.480 --> 26:52.596
- That's the North Pole?
- <i>The sky above</i>

26:52.640 --> 26:55.074
- Hey, buddy, we need some help.
- <i>Hold you in</i>

26:55.160 --> 26:57.469
- Hello!
- <i>Their precious keep</i>

26:57.560 --> 27:02.873
- What are you doing?
- <i>So close your eyes and come with me</i>

27:04.160 --> 27:10.190
<i>The Christmas bells</i>
<i>will bring you home</i>

27:29.280 --> 27:31.794
Hey, look!
Here comes the new Santa!

27:31.840 --> 27:35.071
<i>And now with song</i>
<i>we fill the night</i>

27:35.160 --> 27:38.232
<i>While magic dances</i>
<i>in the light</i>

27:38.320 --> 27:41.392
<i>To wish you now</i>
<i>and all the year</i>

27:41.480 --> 27:43.710
<i>Thejoy that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas cheer</i>

27:43.800 --> 27:47.509
- Sit back.
- <i>Hear our voices fill the air</i>

27:47.600 --> 27:50.717
<i>To drive the</i>
<i>winter's cold away</i>

27:50.800 --> 27:53.917
<i>And so our hearts</i>
<i>with all will share</i>

27:54.000 --> 27:57.072
<i>The love that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas day</i>

27:57.120 --> 28:00.317
<i>The love that comes</i>
<i>with Christmas day</i>

28:00.400 --> 28:05.758
<i>The Christmas bells</i>
<i>will bring you home</i>

28:12.960 --> 28:16.589
- Where are all the grown-ups?
- This is so cool.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.517
Stay here.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.916
Hey, kid, kid.
Kid, who's in charge here?

28:22.000 --> 28:26.357
You are. And I'm not a kid. I've
pointy shoes that are older than you.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.271
I'm an elf.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.796
Uh, you guys, or you girls...
Who gives the orders? Who's your boss?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.711
- You are.
- No, no, no. Uh...

28:33.800 --> 28:35.950
- W-Who's the head elf?
- You are.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.355
Hey! Who's causin' all
the trouble around here?

28:38.440 --> 28:39.793
- He is.
- She is.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.070
Excuse me. Are we
on a coffee break?

28:42.160 --> 28:45.550
- We don't drink coffee.
- Then I guess the break is over!

28:45.600 --> 28:47.909
Back to work. Thanks.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.679
Take it easy on her, will ya?
Who are you?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.712
I'm Bernard.
Nice to meet ya, Santa.

28:53.760 --> 28:58.151
I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night.
There's been dogs barkin',
guns goin' off.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.397
Look, my back's killin' me.
Have you ever tried to shove
a sea kayak down a chimney?

29:01.480 --> 29:03.789
- I'm tired of this small talk.
- Hmm.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.833
The other Santa
disappeared, right?

29:07.920 --> 29:11.469
Wait a minute.
Hey, I know where this is goin'.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.432
It wasn't my fault.
The other guy fell. It was an accident.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.512
I've got homeowner's insurance
and a good attorney.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.518
Not as good as my wife's,
but let's not open up that wound.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.478
Hold it a minute.
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.556
How did you know
the other guy was gone?

29:25.640 --> 29:28.108
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't want a drink.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.555
I'm thirsty and hungry too.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.074
Charlie, I thought I told you
to stay in the sleigh.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.398
- Who's this?
- This... This is my son, Charlie.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.556
I'm sorry. Charlie,
this is Buh, Beh, Beh...

29:39.640 --> 29:41.153
- Bernard.
- Bernard.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.073
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hiya, sport.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.078
- Hey, Dad, he called me "sport"
just like you.
- Wonderful.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.720
Hey, you know what.
I got somethin' for you.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.758
Okay, now hold out
your hand, all right?

29:52.800 --> 29:56.918
Now, be very careful.
This is very old, just like me.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.428
Shake it up, Charlie.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.113
Wow.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.668
Why don't you, uh, hold onto it
for me for a while.

30:16.760 --> 30:22.392
- It might come in handy.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.914
I promise I'll take
real good care of it.

30:24.960 --> 30:29.988
- Make sure you do.
- I will.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.838
Hey, Dad, look!

30:32.920 --> 30:35.309
Huh. Fabulous ball.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.709
- Hey, Barabbas.
- Bernard!

30:37.800 --> 30:42.112
Bernard. Can we take a direct
flight back to reality, or do we
have to change planes in Denver?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.111
Uh, Larry, take Charlie here
and get him some chow.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.435
- No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie!
- He'll be okay.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.351
Follow me. You'll want to
get out of those clothes.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.432
I... Uh... No, look, Barnaby,
I just wanna go home.

31:14.760 --> 31:19.515
Look, I am not Santa Claus!
Ahh!

31:19.600 --> 31:21.591
Did you or did you not
read the card?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.955
- Yeah, I read the card.
- Then you're the new Santa.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.355
In putting on the hat and jacket
you accepted the contract.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.513
- What contract?
- The card in the Santa suit.
You said you read it, right?

31:30.600 --> 31:33.398
So when you put on the suit,
you fell subject to the Santa Clause.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.993
- Here.
- The Santa Claus?

31:35.080 --> 31:37.071
Oh, you mean the guy
that fell off my roof?

31:37.120 --> 31:40.430
No, no, no, not Santa Claus, the person.
Santa Clause, the clause.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.550
What?

31:42.640 --> 31:44.358
- Look, you're...
you're a businessman, right?
- Yeah.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.955
Okay. A clause,
as in the last line of a contract.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.155
- You got the card?
- Oh!

31:52.240 --> 31:54.390
Okay, look.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.392
The Santa Clause:
"In putting on this suit
and entering the sleigh...

31:57.480 --> 32:00.995
"the wearer waives any and all rights to
any previous identity, real or implied,

32:01.080 --> 32:04.277
"and fully accepts the duties
and responsibilities of Santa Claus...

32:04.360 --> 32:08.114
"in perpetuity until such time
that wearer becomes unable to do so...

32:08.200 --> 32:10.589
by either accident or design."

32:10.680 --> 32:13.752
- What does that mean?
- It means you put on the suit,
you're the big guy.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.071
- That's ridiculous.
I didn't put on the suit just to...
- Try to understand this!

32:17.160 --> 32:19.993
Oo-oo-ooh!

32:20.080 --> 32:22.196
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

32:22.240 --> 32:26.199
Toys have to be delivered. I'm not gonna
do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.391
It's Santa's job, but Santa
fell off a roof, your roof.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.796
You read the card, you put on the suit.
That clearly falls under
the Santa Clause.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.030
- So now you're Santa, okay?
- A question.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.758
- What?
- When can I get outta here?

32:36.840 --> 32:40.150
- Dad, you gotta see this place.
- You leave tomorrow morning.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.676
You have 11 months
to get your affairs in order,
and you're due back here Thanksgiving.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.309
- I'm not comin' back here
on Thanksgiving.
- I'll ship the list to your house.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.352
- What list?
- Come on, now. The list.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.591
<i>- He's makin'a list</i>
<i>- Checkin'it twice</i>

32:57.680 --> 33:01.673
<i>Gonna find out</i>
<i>who's naughty or nice</i>

33:01.720 --> 33:05.076
Look, you put a "P"
next to the kids who are nice
and a "C" next to the naughty ones.

33:05.160 --> 33:09.312
- "P" and "C"?
- Yeah. "P" for present,
"C" for coal, right, Bernard?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.960
- Right.
- Wait a minute.
How do I know who's good and bad?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.675
- You'll know.
- What if I don't want to do this?

33:15.760 --> 33:18.274
- Don't even kid about a thing like that.
- Why not?

33:18.360 --> 33:23.229
What if I don't
buy into this Santa Clause thing?
What if I choose not to believe it?

33:34.360 --> 33:38.911
Then there would be millions of
disappointed children around the world.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.152
You see, children hold the spirit
of Christmas within their hearts.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.837
You wouldn't want to be responsible
for killing the spirit of Christmas,

33:47.920 --> 33:50.878
now, would you, Santa?

33:53.200 --> 33:56.749
Judy will take you to your room. Get out
of the suit. It needs to be cleaned.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.189
- And taken in.
- Then get some sleep.

33:59.280 --> 34:02.477
We've got a lot of work to do
and only a year in which to do it.

34:10.239 --> 34:13.072
- Judy.
- Santa.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.875
- Scott Calvin.
- Follow me.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.911
- I'll just take the next train.
- Dad, come on!

34:20.960 --> 34:23.871
Charlie!

34:23.960 --> 34:26.871
- Come on, Dad!
- Charlie, wait up!

34:29.719 --> 34:32.917
- That's funny. I like that.
- I like that too. But I don't like...

34:46.600 --> 34:49.114
Wow!

34:54.600 --> 34:58.195
Can I get you anything?
The kitchen's always open.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.117
How about a stiff drink?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.876
You should get some sleep.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.672
Here are your pyjamas.
I'll be right back.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.391
Oh, oh, look, Judy.
Look. Look over there.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.238
There's a...

35:20.280 --> 35:23.113
Look. Look over there.
I know.

35:23.160 --> 35:27.915
Look. Look over there.
There's a canoe. Aha, it's true.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.911
Oh, look, there's an emu.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.190
- Look at him.
- Shoo.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.994
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.835
- I brought you some cocoa.
- No, thanks.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.993
My own recipe. Took me
1200 years to get it right.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.117
- 1200 years?
- That's right.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.718
You know, I must say, you look
pretty good for your age.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.712
Thanks, but I'm seeing
someone in wrapping.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.594
This is good.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.511
This is really good.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.515
Not too hot, extra chocolate,
shaken, not stirred.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.510
You look distressed.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.068
Distressed?
I'm way past distressed.

36:39.160 --> 36:43.312
- Why's that?
- I'm talking to an elf.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.749
And I stopped believing
in Santa Claus a long time ago.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.628
That's not surprising.
Most grown-ups can't believe in magic.

36:49.720 --> 36:53.713
It just... sort of
grows out of them.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.678
Look, you're
a nice little elf.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.069
- Thanks.
- But this is a dream.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.071
I mean, this is fabulous.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.596
Is that a polar bear
directin' traffic down there?

37:04.640 --> 37:09.236
I... I see it,
but I don't believe it.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.113
- You're missing the point.
- What is the point?

37:12.200 --> 37:14.839
Seeing isn't believing;
believing is seeing.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.668
Kids don't have to see this place
to know that it's here.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.598
They just... know.

37:23.640 --> 37:27.599
Well, you should get some rest.
Good night, sir.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.959
Dad!

38:04.040 --> 38:05.678
Dad!

38:07.880 --> 38:09.950
Wake up, sleepy!

38:10.040 --> 38:11.871
Come on, get up!

38:13.560 --> 38:15.630
Dad!

38:15.680 --> 38:17.557
Dad!

38:17.600 --> 38:20.239
Dad!

38:20.280 --> 38:23.477
Come on, Dad! Come on!

38:23.560 --> 38:25.437
You should see
all the neat toys.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.636
- Stop shakin' me, Charlie.
- Come on. Get up. Get up!

38:27.720 --> 38:30.029
- Okay!
- Come on. It's Christmas morning.

38:30.120 --> 38:33.192
- Great! G-Go and make some coffee.
- Come on, Dad. Let's go!

38:33.240 --> 38:35.310
Okay. Okay.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.197
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Just fine. Just fine.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.078
Are you having a heart attack?
I know CPR.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.991
No, I was just...

40:02.360 --> 40:05.511
- S. C?
- Yeah, Santa Claus.

40:05.560 --> 40:09.394
Hey. Same initials
as your name, Dad.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.954
Scott Calvin.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.349
What?

40:17.800 --> 40:21.076
Oh, Charlie! Oh,
merry Christmas, honey!

40:21.120 --> 40:23.918
- Did you have a good time?
- Great time! The best!

40:23.960 --> 40:28.636
Great... Oh, ho, Scott.
Nice P.J.s. Very festive.

40:28.720 --> 40:32.030
- Where'd you get them?
- I don't know.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.590
- Judy gave them to you.
- Judy. Really.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.551
- Who?
- Up in the North Pole.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.790
Ah, one of Santa's
little helpers.

40:39.840 --> 40:43.753
Last night, Dad and me
went with the flying reindeer.

40:43.800 --> 40:48.749
It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.473
- You know, where they make all the toys?
- Gee, thanks for...

40:51.520 --> 40:54.353
- keeping his feet on the ground.
- You bet.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.871
Honey, you go wait in the car
for a minute, okay? I'll be right there.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.191
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, Dad. Thanks for a great night
at the North Pole.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.795
So, uh, what have you
been telling him?

41:08.880 --> 41:13.715
Nothing. It's just...
I had this really strange dream.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.275
And I... I must have
told him all about it.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.476
Wait!

41:21.240 --> 41:23.151
- Charlie.
- Scott.
- Hi, Dad.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.431
- Nice jammies.
- Thanks. About what you said
in the house.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.351
- Who showed you the workshop?
- The elf.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.512
- How'd I get the pyjamas?
- I told you. Judy.

41:31.600 --> 41:36.594
Oh, wait. Wait. Judy was the name of the
waitress at the restaurant last night.

41:36.640 --> 41:40.189
- Some waitress gave you pyjamas?
- What's this all about?

41:40.280 --> 41:43.317
Dad took me to the North Pole,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.188
- The North Pole.
- Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.113
The regular Santa fell off the roof,
and Dad put on the suit.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.158
Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.

41:59.640 --> 42:03.792
The clause.
The Santa Clause.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.991
It's just a dream.
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

42:07.080 --> 42:10.834
It was a dream. Come on!

42:10.880 --> 42:14.998
I don't even wear pyjamas!
Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.196
Ha! Morning, Mrs McGloin.
Mary Catherine.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.117
Eyes front,
Mary Catherine.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.469
Sometimes boxer shorts.
You know.

42:21.640 --> 42:27.033
So, remember, kids, there is nothing
more painful than third degree burns.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.071
Well, thank you,
Fireman O'Hara.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.197
And I think the whole class
will join me in saying...

42:36.280 --> 42:38.111
sorry about your partner.

42:41.240 --> 42:44.949
Well, perhaps this is a good time
to bring up the psychiatrist.

42:45.040 --> 42:49.238
Charlie, would you like
to introduce your, um...

42:50.400 --> 42:52.595
Dr Miller?

42:52.680 --> 42:55.274
Can I ask Dad to go first?

42:55.320 --> 42:58.039
Well, if that's how
you feel, Charlie.

42:58.120 --> 43:02.272
That's how he feels, Neal.
Come on. Nice sweater, buddy.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.794
This is my dad, Scott Calvin.
He's got a really neat job.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.270
- Thank you, Charlie.
- My dad is Santa Claus.

43:13.880 --> 43:18.908
Oh, boy! I think what he means is,
I'm like Santa Claus.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.197
We're both giving.
We're both jolly.

43:22.240 --> 43:26.028
And we both work very hard
one day a year.

43:26.120 --> 43:29.351
- Oh, boy.
- That's not what I mean, Dad.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.597
Look, on Christmas Eve,
my dad pushed Santa off the roof.

43:32.680 --> 43:35.433
- No, Charlie... Ch... Charlie.
- Santa disappeared
and my dad took his place.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.677
- Charlie!
- Then I went with him
to deliver all the presents.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.439
Then the reindeer flew us to the
North Pole where the head elf,

43:41.520 --> 43:44.751
- Charlie.
- Bernard, gave me this.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.952
Look, I work for a toy company.
I deliver toys all over the country.

43:49.040 --> 43:53.158
So, in a way,
I'm like Santa Claus.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.834
- Yes, sweetheart?
- Do you make the toys?

43:55.920 --> 43:58.195
No, stupid, the elves do!

43:58.280 --> 44:03.798
Bobby, we don't say "stupid,"
and we don't say "elves."
They're little people.

44:03.840 --> 44:07.674
- No, but they really are elves.
- Whatever, honey.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.036
- Which one's your favourite reindeer?
- Comet.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.839
Uh, I, I, I don't have a favourite.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.599
So, let me get this
straight, Santa.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.592
You mean, when I grow up,
if I wanna be Santa Claus,

44:19.640 --> 44:21.756
all I gotta do is
push you off a roof?

44:21.840 --> 44:24.274
All right, he said that. He said that
it was the best Christmas he ever had.

44:24.320 --> 44:27.073
- Oh, big surprise. What do you think?
- It's just nice to hear it from him.

44:27.160 --> 44:30.914
- Is that a problem with you?
- That's my responsibility, isn't it?
- All right. So?

44:31.000 --> 44:34.037
May I speak, please?
I am a doctor.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.680
No, he's not.
He's a psychiatrist.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.399
Please. Go ahead, Dr Miller.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.914
I guess we know
who's the teacher's pet.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.355
Scott! Oh, grow up.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.716
The reason we're here is that
this is far more serious...

44:47.800 --> 44:50.837
than a boy believing
or not believing in Santa Claus.

44:50.880 --> 44:54.475
That's right, because Charlie thinks
that this whole thing actually happened.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.354
Scott, what was the last thing
you and Charlie did...

44:58.400 --> 45:00.550
before you went to bed
Christmas Eve?

45:00.600 --> 45:04.275
We shared a bowl of sugar;
did some shots of brown liquor;

45:04.360 --> 45:06.999
played with my shotguns;
field dressed a cat;

45:08.040 --> 45:10.554
looked for women.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.473
- I read him a book.
- What book?

45:13.560 --> 45:15.516
Uh, <i>Hollywood Wives.</i>

45:15.600 --> 45:17.795
<i>The Night Before Christmas,</i> folks.
Come on!

45:17.840 --> 45:20.115
And did you
go to the North Pole?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.031
T-This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.352
Ridiculous or not, Scott,
for Charlie, this isn't some dream.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.032
It is real.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.509
You need to sit down
with Charlie. Explain to him...

45:30.560 --> 45:33.597
you are not Santa Claus.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.592
They're like the bears
at the North Pole, Dad.

45:36.680 --> 45:40.275
Charlie, I already told ya.
We did not go to the North Pole.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.669
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.597
Denial. You don't
even know what that means.

45:44.680 --> 45:47.797
Well, you are.
I know what happened.

45:47.840 --> 45:52.118
How do you know that?
How? You don't have any proof.

45:52.200 --> 45:56.113
- Proof?
- Why can't we both think of it as just
a great dream and forget about it?

45:56.200 --> 45:59.829
What about this? Remember
all the neat stuff inside?

45:59.920 --> 46:03.833
Charlie, this is a toy.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.549
We used to make things like this
at work, but no one bought 'em.

46:07.640 --> 46:11.315
Here. I don't wanna
talk about this any more.

46:11.400 --> 46:15.359
I know who you are, Dad.
You'll figure it out soon enough.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.991
There are a lot of kids that believe
in you. You can't let them down.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.355
Charlie, you're wrong.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.838
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.988
<i>He sees you</i>
<i>when you're sleeping</i>

46:41.080 --> 46:43.640
<i>He knows when you're awake</i>

46:43.720 --> 46:46.314
<i>He knows if you've</i>
<i>been bad or good</i>

46:46.360 --> 46:48.316
<i>Rollin'</i>
<i>Keep those reindeer rollin'</i>

46:48.400 --> 46:51.870
<i>Okay, you better watch out</i>
<i>You better not cry</i>

46:51.960 --> 46:54.520
<i>- You better not pout I'm tellin' you why</i>
- Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.949
- <i>Santa Claus is coming</i>
- Whoa! We can't stop.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.793
- <i>To town</i>
- But I have to go to the bathroom.

46:59.880 --> 47:03.316
I told you, you should've gone
before we left the North Pole.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.033
<i>And rummy tum-tums</i>

47:06.120 --> 47:10.398
Whoa! Right here.
Turn over here.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.835
<i>Curly-haired dolls</i>
<i>that toddle and coo</i>

47:12.920 --> 47:15.480
<i>Elephant spokes</i>
<i>and kiddie cars too</i>

47:22.600 --> 47:25.398
- Where is he?
- Well, he could be in his room,

47:25.480 --> 47:28.517
jumping up and down on his bed
wearing a red hat and galoshes.

47:28.600 --> 47:31.034
I don't care what Neal's doing.
Where's Charlie?

47:31.120 --> 47:33.554
Oh, ho, ho.
Oh, I see, I see.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.478
Well, if you can't be father of the
year, why not be Father Christmas, huh?

47:36.640 --> 47:39.313
Charlie,
it's just not logical.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.638
How can one man
in one night...

47:43.680 --> 47:45.557
visit all the children
of the world?

47:45.640 --> 47:47.551
Not everyone
celebrates Christmas.

47:47.640 --> 47:52.760
And I think there's some sort
of time continuum that breaks down
once Santa's in his sleigh.

47:52.800 --> 47:58.352
What about fireplaces?
A lot of people don't have them.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.749
How does Santa
visit those people?

48:00.840 --> 48:03.479
He turns into Jell-O and...

48:03.520 --> 48:07.069
The fireplace kind of appears,
and he goes through it like this.

48:07.160 --> 48:11.278
What about the reindeer?

48:11.320 --> 48:15.791
- Have you ever seen a reindeer fly?
- Yes.

48:15.840 --> 48:19.628
- Well, I haven't.
- Have you ever seen a million dollars?

48:19.680 --> 48:21.591
No!

48:21.680 --> 48:25.719
Just because you haven't seen it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.069
Hey, Neal.
Howdy, sport.

48:28.120 --> 48:30.509
- Hi, Dad.
- You wanna take a walk?
I wanna talk to you.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.791
- Sure. I'll get my coat.
- Okay. Hustle up.

48:33.880 --> 48:36.792
Scott? Can I have a minute?

48:36.880 --> 48:39.519
Sure.

48:39.600 --> 48:43.115
I think Charlie is conflicted
at the moment.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.628
Wow. Really?

48:45.720 --> 48:49.679
Boy. Hmm. Appreciate
your analysis. I really do.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.429
But, boy, you got more important things
to worry about, you know.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.877
Like, where are you gonna
get more sweaters after
the circus pulls outta town?

48:57.920 --> 49:01.435
Scott! I mean,
you're not listening.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.829
We are very concerned about this.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.115
Concerned about what?

49:06.200 --> 49:07.792
This...

49:07.880 --> 49:10.838
If Charlie spending time with you
is the best thing for him.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.638
You were right
about the sweater, okay?

49:25.080 --> 49:28.152
Do you think by next year
I'll be big enough to drive
the sleigh all by myself?

49:28.240 --> 49:31.198
- No!
- But I've been practising.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.555
No, that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Charlie, hold on a second.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.672
We've got to talk about
this Santa Claus thing.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.710
Charlie, there...
there is no...

49:44.880 --> 49:47.235
No what, Dad?

49:49.960 --> 49:54.909
There's no reason why we have to
tell anybody about the North Pole.

49:54.960 --> 49:59.988
- Why not?
- Well, sometimes some things,
big things,

50:00.040 --> 50:04.670
should remain un... unsaid,
like between two people...

50:04.720 --> 50:09.510
- Oh, you mean like a secret.
- Yes. Like a secret.
Let's keep it a secret.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.273
How come?

50:12.360 --> 50:15.352
Because of Mom and Neal.

50:15.400 --> 50:18.039
Not just because of them.
There's school.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.839
Everybody thinks... Well,
it's not important what they think.

50:20.920 --> 50:23.992
It...

50:24.040 --> 50:27.396
How does five bucks sound to ya?

50:27.480 --> 50:31.473
This is something I really
want you to do for me, sport.

50:31.560 --> 50:36.350
I want to keep this secret.
Will ya do that, please?

50:36.440 --> 50:39.557
- Okay, Dad.
- All right.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.068
Great.

50:42.120 --> 50:46.636
You don't have to worry about
the Santa Claus thing any more.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.109
So when do I get the five bucks?

50:49.160 --> 50:52.516
<i>... 15 in the morning.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a beautiful day.</i>

50:55.680 --> 50:58.877
<i>Spend the day with me,</i>
<i>Larry B.</i>

51:12.480 --> 51:14.357
Huh?

51:21.120 --> 51:24.112
Something's wrong with the mirror.

51:26.960 --> 51:30.270
What? Something's wrong
with the scale.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.911
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...

51:37.000 --> 51:41.391
Hmm. I'll have a field green
salad and... Oh, my God.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.069
- What the...
- What? Scott?

51:46.600 --> 51:48.989
Calvin?

51:51.560 --> 51:55.951
Sorry, um, the dry cleaner
in my neighbourhood went up in smoke.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.476
Some big chemical fire.
All my clothes, poof, gone.

51:59.560 --> 52:02.836
God. Your... Your weight.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.832
What happened?

52:05.920 --> 52:09.674
Bee sting.
Evidently I'm allergic.

52:09.760 --> 52:13.799
Almost killed me. But the guy
at the emergency room says...

52:13.880 --> 52:16.155
the swelling will go down.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.715
I hope. So,
did I miss anything?

52:19.800 --> 52:21.916
No, we were, uh,
just about to order lunch.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.916
Great! I'm starving.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.675
I'll have a salad and iced tea
and dressing on the side.

52:27.720 --> 52:31.793
Uh, pasta and tomatoes, uh, and
very light on the oil. Can you do that?

52:31.880 --> 52:34.792
And I'll have a Caesar.
No dressing.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.314
And one of those home-made cookies,
the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.039
And, uh, a little slice of cheesecake.
Uh, creme brulee...

52:40.080 --> 52:44.437
and, um, hot fudge sundae,
extra hot fudge.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.356
On the side.

52:48.400 --> 52:52.712
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.

52:52.800 --> 52:57.237
- Stung by a bee, Scott?
- A big bee.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.153
Finished?

53:20.760 --> 53:25.197
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.

53:25.280 --> 53:28.317
But here is
our preliminary...

53:28.360 --> 53:31.113
Total Tank TV spot.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.714
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.

53:33.800 --> 53:37.634
He's gettin' ready
for... Christmas!

53:37.720 --> 53:41.076
- Oh, no.
- Problem?

53:41.160 --> 53:44.596
It's just a little thing.
The elves.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.990
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.

53:48.040 --> 53:51.350
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.756
Just my opinion.
Can't they look a little younger...

53:54.840 --> 53:57.354
with silver specks
on their cheeks?

53:57.440 --> 54:00.512
- Can we continue here?
- Okay.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.632
Now, this year Santa's
not goin' out in a sleigh.

54:03.720 --> 54:07.759
This time he's goin'
Total Tank.

54:07.840 --> 54:11.549
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's
goin' anywhere without his sleigh.

54:11.640 --> 54:14.029
He would if he's tryin'
to sell the Total Tank.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.315
Well, isn't that a pretty picture.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.874
Santa's rollin' down the block
in a panzer.

54:18.920 --> 54:22.071
Well, kids, I... I certainly hope
you've been good this year.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.680
'Cause it looks like Santa
just took out the Pearson home.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.352
- Incoming!
- Oh, please.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.874
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?

54:28.960 --> 54:32.509
Reindeer and Santa. Santa and reindeer.
I-It's kind of a package deal.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.512
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do ya?

54:35.560 --> 54:38.358
Calvin, can we get
back to the presentation?

54:38.440 --> 54:40.476
I'm not done yet.
Since we've opened this box,

54:40.520 --> 54:42.909
have any of you tried
to build the Total Tank?

54:42.960 --> 54:46.919
It's got 10,000 parts,
and even if you do get it together,
it breaks ten minutes later.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.758
- Then you gotta spend more
money just to buy new parts.
- I thought that was the whole point.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.711
No, no, no, no.

54:51.760 --> 54:56.197
What we gotta do is develop
a, a basic, simple, inexpensive toy...

54:56.240 --> 54:58.595
that will nurture
a child's creative thinking.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.916
- Calvin...
- Here, try the brown ones.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.871
Can I see you outside a minute?

55:10.120 --> 55:12.350
I don't know
what's happening to you.

55:12.400 --> 55:15.278
You're starting to look like
the Pillsbury dough boy.

55:15.360 --> 55:19.478
- Y-You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.

55:19.560 --> 55:22.120
- I don't know what came over me.
- W-Well, just get some help.

55:22.160 --> 55:26.278
You know, y-you should s-see a doctor,
a shrink, a dietician, anything.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.909
Just get some help.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.037
Okay, Scott. Time is up.

55:52.080 --> 55:55.709
- Let's get over here
and check your pulse.
- All right.

55:57.440 --> 56:00.193
Okay, hmm?

56:04.080 --> 56:07.470
Huh? Well, nuts. I...

56:07.560 --> 56:10.120
Oh, no, uh,
your pulse is great. I...

56:10.200 --> 56:12.668
Well, I-I don't know, Scott.
Y-You're as healthy as a horse.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.274
Yeah, Clydesdale.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.591
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.915
A little weight? Does this
look like a little weight to you?

56:21.000 --> 56:24.117
Well, weight can fluctuate
from year to year.

56:24.200 --> 56:27.317
Fluctuate? You make it
sound like I'm retainin' water.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.359
I've gained 45 pounds in a week.
Pete, what's happenin' to me?

56:31.400 --> 56:34.198
- Well, what's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.236
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.

56:36.320 --> 56:41.713
Well, then, there is your problem. Just
try to cut back on the sweets, okay?

56:41.800 --> 56:44.519
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.074
How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?

56:47.160 --> 56:52.712
- What?
- I shave in the morning
and in the afternoon I look like this.

56:52.800 --> 56:57.157
Well, it could be
a hormonal imbalance.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.033
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?

57:00.080 --> 57:02.514
- Yeah, well, look at my hair.
It's turnin' grey.
- Oh, it's middle age, buddy.

57:02.600 --> 57:07.071
It happens. And with that body,
you should be thankful you have hair.

57:07.120 --> 57:10.430
Look, i-if it bothers you,
you can dye it, and you should diet!

57:12.040 --> 57:15.077
Ah, just kidding.
Okay, up with the shirt.

57:15.120 --> 57:19.079
Let's take a listen
to the old ticker. Whoa. Okay.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.991
Ooh, it's cold.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.517
Over here, Steve!
I'm open!

58:08.360 --> 58:10.271
What?

58:11.880 --> 58:14.997
I want some ballet slippers.

58:32.080 --> 58:35.709
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.030
- Hold on now.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.

58:38.120 --> 58:41.954
Fax me. Hi. Hey, this probably
looks pretty odd, doesn't it?

58:42.040 --> 58:45.350
- These kids lined up all by themselves.
- Scott,

58:45.440 --> 58:50.434
I think it's safe to say you're taking
this Santa thing to an unhealthy level.

58:50.480 --> 58:54.029
Here's my card.
Call me.

58:54.120 --> 58:57.874
Scott, I... I really have to tell you
that this is beginning to scare me.

58:57.960 --> 59:01.475
I never in my wildest...
Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest...

59:01.520 --> 59:04.239
But certainly never in
my normal dreams would I...

59:04.320 --> 59:07.039
- But then this is Scott
we're talking about and I...
- Laura, the point.

59:07.080 --> 59:10.197
It's just I never thought
you would stoop to changing
your physical appearance...

59:10.280 --> 59:12.840
in order to make
Charlie like you.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.515
- Do you have any concept of how
dangerous this is to a little boy?
- Whoa.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.120
- Whoa, whoa. "How dangerous"?
- Mom, what's the matter?

59:19.200 --> 59:22.237
- Come on, Charlie, we're going home.
- But we just started.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.157
Well, a...
You let him stay. I'll go.

59:24.200 --> 59:27.237
If you don't get your act together,
Scott, so help me...

59:27.320 --> 59:31.552
- Watch it, folks.
- I will just... Oh!
- Mom!
- Come on. Move it, lady!

59:32.600 --> 59:34.909
Kick it!

59:39.440 --> 59:42.557
- Hi there.
- Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.

59:42.600 --> 59:44.511
- You S. C?
- Scott Calvin, that's me.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.034
Sign here, please.

59:49.320 --> 59:51.788
- All right.
- Thanks. I'll get your packages.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.836
- Packages?
- Yeah, there's quite a few of them.

59:53.920 --> 59:57.151
Great. I'll leave the door open.
Just leave them inside here.

59:57.200 --> 59:59.953
Will do.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.830
It's the list.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.839
"Armand Assante"?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.474
Yo!

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.438
Hold it! Hold... Oh!
Hold it!

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.229
- You! You! Take that! Come on! Come on!
- Stay away from the truck.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.159
What am I supposed to do with
all these packages, guys? Come on.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.271
Aah.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.154
You know, I knew it. I knew that... that
something was going on. I just... I...

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.875
What I can't believe is that he would
go behind our backs all this time,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.999
confusing Charlie again just...

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.431
I... I... What are we...
What are we supposed to do?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.478
Well, there's one
obvious alternative.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.637
Okay.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.551
Aah.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.998
- Annie, nice.
- Beep!

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.838
- Johnny, naughty.
- Johnny, wait up.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.474
Gary, nice.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.835
Veronica, very nice.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.075
In your dreams, sleigh boy.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.879
Huh?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.429
I'm in big trouble.
Mm-hmm.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.318
Thank you.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.798
Judge Wayland's office.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.997
Charlie, do you mind
if I talk to you for a minute?

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.674
It's okay, honey. Come on.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.840
We won't be long.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.111
Are we doing
the right thing, Neal?

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.430
- Something needs to shake Scott.
- Yeah, but...

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.313
But to... to take away
his visitation rights.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.198
Honey, the man is delusional.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.358
Okay, okay, so maybe I'm having
second thoughts, kind of. I just...

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.671
I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.711
Well, he's a little old.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.034
Oh, come on, Laura.
Don't you remember when you
stopped believing in Santa Claus?

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.193
I was Charlie's age,
I guess, I...

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.630
I wrote Santa a letter
every week that year.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.111
Well, you know, okay,
you know, maybe...

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.720
Maybe not every week, but...

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.273
Boy, I really wanted
a "Mystery Date" game.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.073
Do you remember those?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.152
No. Of course you don't.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.629
You know, no one does.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.678
I... I don't even think
they make them any more, but...

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.035
Well, anyway...

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.351
Christmas morning came and...

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.039
Oh, I got dozens of presents.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.038
Oh, I got everything.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.636
Except "Mystery Date."

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.554
I was three, and it was
an Oscar Meyer wienie whistle.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.156
Christmas came.
No wienie whistle.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.477
And that's when
I stopped believing.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.636
You were three?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.228
Yeah.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.794
Oh, Neal.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.398
- Where's Charlie? I want to talk to him.
- He's with the judge.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.556
Dad!

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.278
It's all okay.
I told the judge everything...

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.880
about you and the North Pole.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.394
After reviewing all
of your testimonies,

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.352
I've come to a very
difficult decision.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.876
I'm sorry to do this in light
of the holiday season,

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.999
but in the best interest
of the child,

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.789
I'm granting the petition
of Dr and Mrs Miller.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.269
Mr Calvin, as of today,

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.238
all of your visitation rights
are suspended...

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.029
pending a hearing
after the first of the year.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.991
- Hey, Neal.
- Scott.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.755
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Don't make me beat you up, Neal.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.473
Oh, would Santa
really beat someone up?

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.990
- I'm this close.
- So you still believe you're Santa?

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.713
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.236
Of course you are, Dad.
How can you say that?

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.068
- Think of all those kids.
- The only kid I'm thinkin' about is you.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.755
Dad, I'm fine.
You can't let them down.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.758
- They all believe in you!
- Charlie, listen.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.833
You listen!
You think you know who he is. You don't!

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.031
Charlie. Honey, listen.
You're confused.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.957
I know exactly who he is.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.355
Charlie, he's not Santa!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.473
He is too, Santa!
We went to the North Pole together.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.638
I saw it. The elves are real old
even though they look like me.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.355
Bernard called me sport,
'cause he knew everything.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.630
Right, Dad?

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.234
Remember!

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.355
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.555
I love you, Dad.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.033
Could you guys leave us
alone for a minute?

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.993
I mean, so I can
say goodbye to him properly?

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.392
You saw!
You saw the ball come to life.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.795
You bet I did.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.196
- Well, Charlie, I guess I... I better go.
- I'll get my stuff.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.397
Well, wait, sport. Sport. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.558
I think it's a much better idea
if you just stayed here with your mom.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.319
I wanna be with you, Dad.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.595
Boy, I love hearing you say that.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.989
You mean I can go?

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.836
Boy, this bird is dry. Haven't
you people heard about basting?

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.718
Bernard!

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.634
- Hiya, sport.
- Bernard, can I go?
Please, can I go, Bernard?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.029
It's okay with me.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.351
Charlie, if, uh...

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.197
Charlie?

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.716
Scott!

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.116
Charlie!

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.995
This is our perpetrator.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.917
Scott Calvin, 38 years old.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.474
Believes himself
to be Santa Claus.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
this one's not gonna be easy to find.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.474
Uh, won't the bright red suit
and beard give him away?

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.595
Charlie's got some great ideas
on how to keep you safe.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.035
Santa, this is Quintin,
head of research and development.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.469
- Quintin, good to meet ya.
- Hello, Santa.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.399
Charlie and I have put our heads
together, and I think we've got
a few surprises for you.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:01.950
This is some of the best stuff that's
come out of the workshop since the ball.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.194
Fabulous.
What happens if I fall off the roof?

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.198
Is this the most
current photo you have?

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.117
Hold on.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.832
- Hello?
- <i>Mom.</i>
- Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.515
Honey, how are you? Are you...
Are... Where are you? Are you okay?

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.591
<i>I'm fine.</i>
<i>We're up at the North Pole.</i>

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.148
Charlie, are you sure you're okay?

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.437
<i>I'm terrific! I'm helping</i>
<i>the elves build a new sleigh.</i>

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.995
<i>We're trying for a vertical takeoff.</i>
<i>Well, gotta go. The elves need me.</i>

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.469
- No, Charlie, wait. No, don't
hang up the phone, honey.
- <i>Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine.</i>

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.716
- <i>See you at Christmas.</i>
- Charlie, don't... Ah.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.752
Fireplaces will no longer be a problem.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.389
It's a new fabric.
Completely flame retardant.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:57.116
- It's light, yet durable.
- And you can wear the jumpsuit
under your coat and pants.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.715
But what do I do
if I fall off a roof?

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.629
We'll cordon off a three-block radius
around Dr Miller's house.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.353
Now, Calvin is to be
apprehended unharmed.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.393
And remember, he'll probably
be dressed like Santa Claus.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.749
<i>Give it your best shot</i>

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.519
<i>'Cause what you got is</i>
<i>oh, so sweet</i>

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.590
- Freeze!
- What the...

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.832
<i>I need a routine</i>
<i>So gimme all your lovin'</i>

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.668
- It's not even my suit. It's a rental.
- <i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.756
<i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>
<i>Don't let up until we're through</i>

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.509
"From Comet, To Santa."
Did you make the card?

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.835
It's a nice rope.
Just in case I fall off the roof?

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.557
Comet, this means a lot to me.
Thanks, buddy.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.676
<i>And if I blow my top</i>

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.914
<i>Will you let it</i>
<i>go to your head</i>

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.596
<i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>
<i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.911
All right, let's go!

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.434
- You ready to go, sport?
- You betcha, Dad.
- <i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.318
- Now Dasher, now Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!
- <i>All your hugs and kisses too</i>

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.676
On Comet, on Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.193
Bye-bye. Bye, Quintin.
Bye, Peewee.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.071
Merry Christmas.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.871
Take your time.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.832
Turn to your right.
Hello!

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.398
No.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.759
- Charlie, stay in your seat.
- I gotta show you this.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.554
Radar-jamming jingle bells,
snow screen,

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.114
DC-10 alert
and air freshener.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.312
- Wow.
- And most important of all, your hat.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.591
- My hat?
- It's lined with a two-way radio.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.389
Microphone's in here.
It connects you directly to Judy.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.358
- Wait a minute. What's this?
- Oh, that's a C.D.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.552
- Compact disc.
- No. Cookie/ cocoa dispenser.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.795
The cocoa comes out nice and hot.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.799
- And... out pops the cookie.
- <i>Gimme all your lovin'</i>

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.112
- How could I have done this
without you, Charlie?
- You couldn't.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.080
- You're fatter this year.
- Thank you very much. You've grown too.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.472
And you were a very good girl
this year, but I want you
to go back to sleep, okay?

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.556
- I think the milk's a little sour.
- It's soy milk.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.031
- Huh?
- You said you were lactose intolerant.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.719
I did say that, didn't I?
Thanks for remembering.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.990
Go to sleep.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.152
- Merry Christmas, Sara.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.110
Look, there's Mom and Neal's street!
Can we go there next?

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.311
- Sure.
- I made something for them
at the workshop.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.071
Freeze!

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.310
Ah, ho, ho.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.079
You officers really gave me a start.
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.874
- Not for you, fat boy.
- "Fat boy"? Guys.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.595
- Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now.
- Oh!

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.319
Guys, guys, I got a lot of work to do.
This is a big mistake, really.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.437
You gotta watch the suit too. This
is so old. It's an antique, you know.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.476
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the sleigh.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.710
We got Calvin.
We're bringing him out.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.031
<i>Santa, are you okay?</i>
<i>Over. Over.</i>

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.752
- Watch your head.
- Santa, are you all right?
- Santa?

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.237
- It'll be okay, kids.
- Let him go! Let Santa go!

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.313
Honey, I'm sure
Charlie's fine.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.468
We've got a problem. Santa was at
the Miller's, but he's not responding.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.235
Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.915
- Let's go!
- Go!

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.029
Go, go, go, go!
Move it!

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.718
Look, I know
you're Scott Calvin.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.952
You know you're Scott Calvin.
So let's make this simple.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.635
I say, name.
You say, Scott Calvin.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.075
Name?

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.350
Kriss Kringle.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.358
- Name?
- <i>Sinter Klas.</i>

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.868
- Name?
- <i>Pere Noel.</i>

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.191
<i>Buono Natale.</i>
<i>Pelz-Nicole.</i>

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.714
Topo Gigio.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.954
Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours
in the tank will change your mind.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.751
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.400
Don't worry.
We're the good guys.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.869
Come on.
Let's go save Santa.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.793
We can't. The police
are watching this place.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.078
Yeah, they probably are.
But you see, we weren't figuring
on walking out the front door.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.352
We find that we can get around
a lot faster if we fly.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.233
Now... grab hold of my hand.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.158
And hang on tight.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.310
- And Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.828
Don't ever try this
without elf supervision.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.157
Hmm? Ah!

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.277
We're looking for Santa Claus.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.079
Go home, kids.
Visiting hours are over.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.709
We're not kids,
and we're not visiting.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.072
- We're here to bust out my dad.
- You're the Calvin boy.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.032
Who... Who are these
other kids?

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.594
We're your worst nightmare.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.234
Elves with attitude.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.675
Shouldn't have had that doughnut.
Oh!

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.836
Untie me! I mean it!

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.229
Untie...

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.915
- Charlie!
- Are you okay, Dad?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.230
I am now.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.154
- How'd you do that?
- Tinsel. Not just for decoration.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.758
Hmm.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.594
Hey, excuse me. Can I get
some of that tinsel?

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.274
Mom?

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.436
Mom!

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.876
Neal. I'm home!

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.117
Charlie?

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.953
- Charlie?
- Charlie.
- Oh, my God, Charlie.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.231
Sweetheart. Oh, God.
Come here. Come here.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.709
Oh, my boy.
Oh, my sweetheart.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.196
Oh! My boy, you're home!

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.232
Oh, I missed you so much.
How are you?

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.875
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Are you okay? Look at me.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.997
- Oh, Charlie. I missed you, honey.
- Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.033
- We were so worried
about you. Look at you.
- Mom, put me down. Stop kissing me!

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.475
I don't have a lot of time.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.553
Did you leave the gifts
I made under the tree?

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.676
- You bet I did.
- We better go.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.990
- No, Charlie. No, no, no.
- No! No, wait, Charlie.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.071
It's okay, Laura.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.957
Actually, I...

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.873
I think it's
a much better idea...

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.595
- that you stay here
with your Mom and Neal.
- Really?

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.791
- But, Dad...
- No buts, Charlie.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.429
I can't be selfish.
I can't be with you all the time.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.596
We're a family.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.875
You, me, your mom...

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.598
and Neal.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.552
And they need to be with you too.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.074
I miss you too much.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.714
Come here a minute.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.670
Ah, listen to me.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.876
Come on, listen. There's...
There's a lot of kids out there.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.957
Okay? Millions of kids.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.795
And they're...
They all... They all believe in me.
They're countin' on me, Charlie. And I...

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.919
I'm not gonna let them down.
I got a lot of work to do.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.596
So I can't be selfish either.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.832
You gave me a wonderful gift, Charlie.
Listen, a wonderful gift.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.354
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.755
You helped make me Santa.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.673
Selfish? Come on.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:54.230
You're the least...
the least selfish person I know.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.353
I love you, Santa Claus.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.554
I love you, son.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.834
Shh.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.110
It's okay.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.116
Okay. It's okay. Shh.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.357
Laura, what do you think? Christmas Eve
you guys spend with Charlie?

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.916
Oh, my God.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.755
It's you.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.436
It really is you.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.353
You really are...

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.159
Santa Claus.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.071
Pretty cool, huh?

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.230
Oh, my God.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.630
And your parents thought
I'd never amount to anything.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.679
Oh, wait. Don't go yet.
I have something for you. I...

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.471
It's Santa!

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.717
- Scott.
- Neal.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.235
- Santa?
- It's okay, Neal.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.115
Here.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.515
It's, um...
Well, it's...

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.354
It's my Christmas present for you.
It's the, um... It's the custody papers.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:35.237
And I want you to come and see
Charlie as often as you can.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.909
You can count on it.
Thanks, Laura.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.990
Merry Christmas.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.356
What's all this boo-hooing goin'
on here? Hey, how ya doin'?

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.675
It's nothin', Bernard.
I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.309
What goodbye? Charlie,
you still got the glass ball, right?

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.755
- Yeah.
- Well, all you gotta do...

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.229
is shake it whenever
you want to see your dad.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.153
- Really?
- He can come back to see you...

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.231
anytime day or night.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.630
Hey, have I ever
steered ya wrong?

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.911
Nice sweater.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.878
Hey, did we make this?

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.315
Laura.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.828
He's sucking us
into his delusions.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.595
Look at the elaborate
measures he's taken.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.229
Neal, relax.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.271
I'll explain it to you later.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.477
Where'd he go?

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.353
Go, go, go, go!
Team one, heads up!

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.108
- Okay, stand back, folks.
Give us some room.
- I'm scared, Dad.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.152
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks. Return to your homes!

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.949
- Stay off the street. Come on, folks.
Let us do our job here.
- Oh, my gosh. Um...

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.673
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.076
Um, you know, you don't have to
send anybody... Oh, my gosh, wait!

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.271
- Hey!
- He's my ex-husband,
and he's already up the chimney.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.669
Chief, look up there.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.230
Oh, Santa!

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.198
Santa Claus.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.033
Look!

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.231
What is it?

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.118
Oh, wow!

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.760
Up there! Do you see it?
Hey, do you see it?

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.994
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Bye, Dad.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.834
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.437
- I'm sorry, Charlie.
- That's okay, Neal.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.195
You were just denying
your inner child.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.239
You're gonna make a great
psychiatrist one day, kid.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.757
No, I think I'm going to go
into the family business.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.832
Look out below!

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.073
My wienie whistle.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.074
Bye, Santa Claus. Bye.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.072
- Merry Christmas.
- See you next year.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.794
Charlie?
Time to come inside.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.274
Mom, this stupid ball's
not working.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.591
Shoot.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.636
- Hey, sport.
- Dad!

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.235
You miss me already?
I've been gone, what? Ten minutes.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.874
Gimme a break.
I was on my way to Cleveland.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.428
Come here and give me a hug.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.077
Oh!

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.150
- Do you wanna go for a quick ride?
- Yeah!

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.078
- Uh...
- Of course, it's up to your mom.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.315
Please, Mom.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:19.431
Go on. Get outta here.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.080
All right. Hold on.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.358
- On our way.
- Bye, Mom.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.309
Just... Just a quick one.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.439
And, uh, not over any oceans, Scott.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.476
- Bye, Mom!
- Scott.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.433
- Bye.
- Scott!

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.951
Santa!

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.836
<i>All the brightly colored</i>
<i>paper</i>

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.037
<i>Lies around</i>

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.350

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.031
