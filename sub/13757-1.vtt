00:54.429 --> 00:56.973
AND SHE SAID,
"NO, IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

00:57.056 --> 01:00.101
IT'S MY TOASTER,
I'M NOT SELLING IT TO ANYBODY."

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603

[applause]

18:31.652 --> 18:33.737
- MOM, DAD,

18:33.821 --> 18:35.823
I FOUND THIS IN YOUR ROOM,
AND I HAVE A QUESTION.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.908
- [chuckles] HONEY,
I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAVE

18:37.991 --> 18:40.536
THAT BIRDS AND BEES TALK.
- OH, DEAR LORD.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.578
[laugh track]
- BUT DAD, I LEARNED

18:41.662 --> 18:44.373
ALL ABOUT THE BIRDS AND BEES
AND OTHER WILDLIFE

18:44.456 --> 18:45.457
WHILE IN THE SCOUTS.
[laugh track]

18:45.541 --> 18:47.543
- NO, SWEETIE,
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.461
- YES, SON.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.756
WHEN A MOMMY BIRD
AND A DADDY BEE LOVE EACH OTHER,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.591
THEY WILL COME TOGETHER
AND MAKE A BABY.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.051
- HOWEVER, SOMETIMES,

18:56.134 --> 18:58.387
THE BIRDS LIKE TO STUNG
BY THE BEES FOR FUN.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.555
[laugh track]
- OTHER TIMES,

18:59.638 --> 19:02.057
THE BEES LIKE TO BE CHOKED
BY THE BIRDS.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.893
- SOMETIMES, THE BIRD AND BEE
WILL SWITCH ROLES...

19:04.977 --> 19:06.144
[laugh track]
WHERE THE BEE GETS STUNG

19:06.228 --> 19:08.063
BY A FAKE STINGER
THAT THE BIRD WEARS.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.524
[laugh track]
- THEN THERE ARE TIMES

19:10.607 --> 19:13.652
WHEN THE BIRD WEARS A MASK,
WHERE SHE HAS TO TRUST THE BEE

19:13.735 --> 19:15.654
TO DO THINGS
THAT HURT IN THE BEGINNING,

19:15.737 --> 19:18.323
BUT IN THE END, FEEL AMAZING.
[laugh track]

19:18.407 --> 19:20.784
- OTHER TIMES, A BEE
WILL HOOK UP WITH ANOTHER BEE,

19:20.868 --> 19:23.078
BUT IT'S COOL,
BECAUSE IT WAS IN A HOT TUB.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.998
- SOMETIMES, A BIRD
LIKES TO GET STUNG

19:26.081 --> 19:30.419
BY MANY DIFFERENT BEES IN A ROW,
WHILE SHE WAS IN COLLEGE.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.169
- SOMETIMES,
THE BEE GOES TO VEGAS

19:31.253 --> 19:33.964
AND SLEEPS WITH A STRANGE BIRD.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.967
THEN HE FINDS OUT
THAT THE BIRD HAS A STINGER.

19:37.050 --> 19:37.968
[laugh track]
THAT BEE HAD TO KILL THAT BIRD

19:38.051 --> 19:39.761
AND LEAVE THE BODY
OUTSIDE THE CITY.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.555
- UH-OH.
- SOMETIMES, THE--

19:41.638 --> 19:44.308
- MOM? DAD?

19:44.391 --> 19:48.395
ARE WE STILL TALKING
ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.439
[both chuckle]
[laugh track]

19:50.522 --> 19:55.152
[cheers and applause]

19:55.235 --> 19:56.069
- OKAY, FINE,
GO AHEAD, TELL ME.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.740
- OKAY, HERE WE GO, MAN.
SO PICTURE THIS.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.283
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
A CUTE, LITTLE UNICORN

20:01.366 --> 20:03.660
DROPS IN OUT OF THE SKY
ONTO THIS LITTLE CLIFF,

20:03.744 --> 20:05.787
AND HE'S STANDING ON THE EDGE,
TERRIFIED.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.248
THE ONLY WAY OUT
IS THROUGH THIS CHAINSAW PIT

20:08.332 --> 20:10.292
WITH SWORDS AND KNIVES
AND BLADES SWINGING ALL AROUND,

20:10.375 --> 20:14.004
SO HE SUCKS IT UP
LIKE A TRUE UNICORN MAN WOULD,

20:14.087 --> 20:15.005
HE JUMPS OVER THE CHAINSAWS,

20:15.088 --> 20:17.758
FINALLY MAKES IT
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.010
CLEAR OUT OF NOWHERE COMES
THIS VIKING SON OF A BITCH,

20:20.093 --> 20:22.512
AND KICKS HIM OFF THE CLIFF, AND
HE FALLS DOWN INTO THE SPIKES,

20:22.596 --> 20:24.139
DEAD MEAT, GUTS ALL OVER.
POOR UNICORN.

20:24.222 --> 20:27.351
- THAT IS
THE ABSOLUTE WORST IDEA EVER.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.771
IT WOULD NEVER GET MADE.
THAT SHOW WOULD NEVER GET MADE.
