01:59.294 --> 02:01.635
Friday, 30 November, 1962

03:11.792 --> 03:15.342
Waking up begins with saying
''am'' and ''now''.

03:15.432 --> 03:17.741
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

03:36.351 --> 03:40.471
For the past eight months waking
up has actually hurt.

03:44.430 --> 03:48.629
The cold realization that
I'm still here slowly sets in.

03:49.990 --> 03:52.740
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

03:52.830 --> 03:56.139
I was never one to jump out of bed and
greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

03:57.309 --> 04:01.510
I used to want to punch him sometimes
in the morning he was so happy.

04:01.590 --> 04:05.190
I always used to tell him that only fools
greet the day with a smile...

04:05.269 --> 04:08.070
...that only fools possibly
escape the simple truth.

04:08.149 --> 04:10.900
That now isn't simply now.

04:12.149 --> 04:15.029
It's a cold reminder.
One day later than yesterday.

04:15.829 --> 04:18.548
One year later than last year.

04:18.629 --> 04:22.779
And that sooner or later it will come.

04:23.469 --> 04:26.109
He used to laugh at me and then
give me kiss on the cheek.

04:27.589 --> 04:30.739
It takes time in the morning
for me to become George.

04:30.829 --> 04:35.058
The time to adjust to what is expected
of George and how he is to behave.

04:36.588 --> 04:39.547
By the time I have dressed and
put the final layer of polish...

04:39.628 --> 04:43.828
...on the now slightly stiff
but quite perfect George...

04:45.228 --> 04:47.187
...I know fully what part
I'm supposed to play

04:59.307 --> 05:02.537
Looking in the mirror staring back at me
isn't so much as a face...

05:02.627 --> 05:05.747
...as the expression of a predicament.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.897
Just get through the goddamn day.

05:11.627 --> 05:13.537
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

05:13.627 --> 05:14.947
But then again...

05:16.667 --> 05:18.947
...my heart has been broken.

05:19.026 --> 05:22.256
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

05:23.026 --> 05:24.587
...can't breathe.

06:15.824 --> 06:19.704
Aren't you going to say something?
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

06:19.784 --> 06:21.063
What are you doing?

06:21.143 --> 06:23.533
Just stop it.
Stop it.

06:23.623 --> 06:25.743
I don't think that you're quite
ready for life in a glass house.

06:26.623 --> 06:28.503
Drapes, old man.

06:30.584 --> 06:33.703
You're the one who is always saying
that we are invisible.

06:34.903 --> 06:37.133
That's not exactly what I meant.

06:58.982 --> 07:02.022
For the first time in my life
I can't see my future.

07:03.462 --> 07:05.823
Every day goes by in a haze.

07:06.942 --> 07:09.772
But today I have decided
will be different.

07:20.061 --> 07:23.050
Finally. You know it's been
raining here all day.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.701
I've been trapped in this house
waiting for you to call.

07:25.781 --> 07:29.250
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

07:30.781 --> 07:34.220
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

07:34.301 --> 07:37.210
...correct number. How may I help you?
- This is Harold Ackerley.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.891
I'm Jim's cousin.

07:38.981 --> 07:42.180
Of course.
Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

07:42.261 --> 07:45.540
I'm afraid I'm calling with
some bad news.

07:46.941 --> 07:48.980
There has been a car accident.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.229
An accident?

07:51.264 --> 07:54.199
There has been a lot of snow here
lately and the roads have been icy.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.820
On his way into town,
Jim lost control of his car.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.940
It was instantaneous apparently.

08:06.579 --> 08:10.569
It happened late yesterday, but his
parents didnt want to call you.

08:13.178 --> 08:14.608
I see.

08:14.698 --> 08:16.848
In fact, they don't that
I'm calling you now.

08:16.939 --> 08:19.328
But I thought that you should know.

08:24.819 --> 08:26.968
Thank you.

08:27.058 --> 08:31.259
I know this must be quite a shock.
It was for all of us.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.727
Yes, indeed.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.168
- Will there be a service?
- The day after tomorrow.

08:45.378 --> 08:48.178
Well, I suppose I should
get off the phone...

08:49.138 --> 08:51.177
...and book a plane flight.

08:51.258 --> 08:54.138
The service is just for family.

08:56.817 --> 08:58.537
For family, of course.

09:01.496 --> 09:03.457
Well, thank you for calling.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.617
- Mr. Ackerley?
- Yes?

09:07.496 --> 09:10.457
- May I ask what happened to the dogs?
- Dogs?

09:10.536 --> 09:14.737
There was a dog with him but he died.
Was there another one?

09:14.816 --> 09:17.696
Yes, there was a small female.

09:17.776 --> 09:19.607
I don't know, I'm sorry.

09:19.696 --> 09:22.296
I haven't heard anyone
mentioning another dog.

09:29.576 --> 09:32.536
- Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.
- Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

13:13.447 --> 13:14.517
Hello, Charley.

13:14.607 --> 13:16.356
How did you know it was me?

13:16.447 --> 13:19.165
Charlotte, nobody else calls me
before eight in the morning.

13:19.246 --> 13:23.005
I didn't call too early, did I?
You sound grumpy.

13:23.086 --> 13:24.595
No, I have a headache.

13:24.686 --> 13:28.805
Listen, I was going to call you actually.
Is too late to change my mind about tonight.

13:28.925 --> 13:32.476
No, of course not.
I haven't seen you all week.

13:32.566 --> 13:36.275
- I'm dying for a dose of you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

13:36.365 --> 13:38.965
So great, I'll see you tonight.

13:39.045 --> 13:40.795
I have to run.
I'm late for the work.

13:40.926 --> 13:43.075
I'll call you later from school.

13:43.165 --> 13:45.075
Alright, I see you then.

13:45.165 --> 13:47.555
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye, old man.

14:30.363 --> 14:32.163
Good morning, Mr. George.

14:33.803 --> 14:36.123
Sir, you don't look so good today.

14:36.158 --> 14:38.303
Good morning, Alva.
No, I didn't sleep very well.

14:38.923 --> 14:41.122
You forgot to take the bread
out of the freezer this morning.

14:41.157 --> 14:42.515
It stays fresh that way.

14:42.723 --> 14:44.923
It was a little too fresh this morning.

14:45.002 --> 14:46.591
There are some papers
laid out on my desk...

14:46.627 --> 14:48.693
...which need to stay there.
Please don't move them.

14:49.002 --> 14:52.363
- I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.
- It's okay, sir.

14:52.442 --> 14:54.193
- Alva?
- Yes, sir?

14:54.283 --> 14:56.883
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

16:03.538 --> 16:07.657
<i>This government, as promised,
has maintained the closest surveillance...</i>

16:07.692 --> 16:11.745
<i>...of the Soviet military buildup
on the Island of Cuba.</i>

16:12.587 --> 16:15.586
<i>Within the past week unmistakable evidence...</i>

16:15.854 --> 16:17.918
<i>...has established the fact...</i>

17:24.796 --> 17:26.204
- Professor Falconer?
- Yes?

17:26.239 --> 17:28.540
There was a student here this
morning asking for your address.

17:28.575 --> 17:29.706
My address?

17:31.396 --> 17:33.916
- Did you give it to him?
- Yes, sir.

17:33.996 --> 17:35.195
I did.

17:35.276 --> 17:36.866
I hope that's okay.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.635
I realize that I probably shouldn't
have but he was very nice.

17:40.715 --> 17:43.075
Before I knew it he...

17:44.075 --> 17:46.904
Your hair looks great up like that.
I really fits suits you.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.025
You always look so beautiful...

17:50.115 --> 17:52.264
...really fresh...

17:52.354 --> 17:54.794
You have such a lovely smile.

18:01.954 --> 18:03.944
- Arpège?
- Sir?

18:05.914 --> 18:07.424
Really beautiful.

18:17.017 --> 18:19.666
<i>...that a series of offensive missile sites...</i>

18:20.234 --> 18:22.353
- Good morning, Don.
- Good morning, George.

18:37.113 --> 18:38.782
Good morning, George.

18:39.632 --> 18:41.302
Good morning, Grant.

18:42.112 --> 18:44.553
You look awful.
What have you been doing?

18:48.152 --> 18:49.222
Look around you, Grant.

18:49.312 --> 18:52.302
Most of these students aspire to
nothing more than corporate job...

18:52.392 --> 18:55.782
...and a desire to raise coke-drinking,
TV-watching children...

18:55.872 --> 18:58.102
...who as soon as they can
speak start chanting TV jingles...

18:58.192 --> 19:01.182
...and smashing things with hammers.
- You're really scaring me today, George.

19:01.272 --> 19:03.193
Don't tell me. You have
easy time with these students.

19:03.228 --> 19:05.912
I found them staring at me
in a kind of bovine stupor...

19:05.991 --> 19:07.502
...as if I were lecturing in
a foreign language.

19:07.592 --> 19:09.951
Remind me why we shouldn't
all just be annihilated.

19:10.032 --> 19:11.470
You seem to think this is all a joke.

19:11.614 --> 19:14.179
We're living in a world where
nuclear war is a real threat.

19:14.213 --> 19:16.152
I don't understand how
that doesn't concern you.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.861
You're serious, aren't you?

19:17.951 --> 19:18.782
Yes, I'm serious.

19:18.871 --> 19:22.021
George did you even read the article
I gave you on bomb shelters?

19:22.112 --> 19:23.852
Our is almost done. We had 3
contractors work on it...

19:23.888 --> 19:25.446
...so none of them know what we've got.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.390
I'm having the outside of it landscaped
so no one will that it's there.

19:28.470 --> 19:29.300
Really?

19:32.598 --> 19:34.396
If word gets out that
you've got a better shelter...

19:34.431 --> 19:36.540
...then everyone will try to get in
when something happens.

19:36.630 --> 19:37.910
So?

19:37.990 --> 19:40.980
There will be no time for sentiment
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

19:41.339 --> 19:44.081
If it's going to be a world with
no time for sentiment Grant...

19:44.116 --> 19:45.699
...the it's not a world
that I want to live in.

20:29.468 --> 20:32.268
After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.550
I think you've all...

20:39.960 --> 20:42.828
...read the Huxley novel I assigned
more than three weeks ago?

20:47.028 --> 20:49.097
How does the title relate to our story?

20:49.987 --> 20:52.057
- Yes, Mr. Mong.
- It doesn't.

20:52.147 --> 20:56.857
It's about a rich guy who's too
afraid that he's too old for this girl...

20:56.947 --> 20:59.747
...and thinks that a young guy...

21:26.425 --> 21:27.416
Russ.

21:39.146 --> 21:41.785
Russ?

21:58.185 --> 21:59.694
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.174
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

22:03.264 --> 22:06.863
...the stupidest text in the Bible is
they hated me without a cause.

22:06.944 --> 22:09.604
Does that mean the Nazis were
right to hate the Jews?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.783
- Is Huxley an anti-Semite?
- No.

22:19.903 --> 22:22.463
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.427
Of course, the Nazis were
wrong to hate the Jews.

22:25.462 --> 22:27.465
But their hating the Jews
was not without a cause.

22:30.263 --> 22:31.933
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

22:33.263 --> 22:34.853
The cause was imagined.

22:34.943 --> 22:37.543
The cause was fear.

22:39.303 --> 22:41.663
Let's leave the Jews out o
this just for a moment.

22:43.303 --> 22:46.052
Let's think of another minority.
One that...

22:46.143 --> 22:48.263
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

22:50.782 --> 22:54.093
There are all sorts of minorities,
blondes for example...

22:54.181 --> 22:56.301
...or people with freckles.

22:57.661 --> 23:00.411
But a minority is only
thought of as one...

23:00.501 --> 23:03.701
...when it constitutes some kind of
threat to the majority.

23:03.781 --> 23:06.141
A real threat or an imagined one.

23:06.222 --> 23:08.451
And therein lies the fear.

23:10.621 --> 23:14.381
If the minority is somehow invisible...

23:15.621 --> 23:18.091
...and the fear is much greater.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.997
That fear is why the
minority is persecuted.

23:22.033 --> 23:23.490
So, you see there always is a cause.

23:23.525 --> 23:24.629
The cause is fear.

23:25.141 --> 23:26.781
Minorities are just people.

23:28.421 --> 23:29.541
People like us.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.610
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.690
So tell you what? We're gonna
forget about Mr. Huxley today...

23:43.700 --> 23:46.340
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

23:46.419 --> 23:48.460
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

23:49.099 --> 23:51.539
Fear is taking over our world.

23:51.620 --> 23:55.329
Fear is being used as a tool of
manipulation in our society.

23:55.419 --> 23:58.859
It's how politicians peddle policy.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.609
It's how Madison Avenue sells us
things that we don't need.

24:01.699 --> 24:03.209
Think about it.

24:04.499 --> 24:05.979
Fear of being attacked.

24:07.499 --> 24:10.539
Fear of that there are communists
lurking around every corner.

24:10.619 --> 24:12.685
Fear of that some little
Caribbean country...

24:12.721 --> 24:15.131
...that doesn't believe in our way
of life poses a threat to us.

24:15.179 --> 24:17.314
Fear that black culture
may take over the world.

24:17.348 --> 24:20.338
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

24:21.499 --> 24:23.568
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

24:26.378 --> 24:29.739
Fear that our bad breath
might ruin our friendships.

24:32.339 --> 24:34.778
Fear of growing old and being alone.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.936
The of that we're useless and that
no one cares what we have to say.

24:50.336 --> 24:51.926
Have a good weekend.

24:57.937 --> 25:00.767
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

25:00.857 --> 25:03.496
Why don't you always
talk to us like that?

25:03.577 --> 25:05.327
I don't think it went over very well.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.566
Man, fear of things gets
to me all the time.

25:07.656 --> 25:10.486
But you can't talk about it with
anyone or you just sound like a fool.

25:10.576 --> 25:14.256
- You can't even talk about it with Lois?
- I don't think she's afraid of anything.

25:14.336 --> 25:16.246
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

25:16.336 --> 25:18.056
What are you afraid of, sir?

25:18.136 --> 25:19.776
Cars.

25:19.856 --> 25:22.238
How can you live in Los Angeles
and be afraid of cars?

25:22.273 --> 25:23.403
Maybe you can't.

25:23.989 --> 25:27.926
Sometimes my fear of things
can almost paralyze me.

25:28.016 --> 25:32.084
It's like I get really panic stricken and
I feel like I might explode or something.

25:33.055 --> 25:35.524
- May I ask you a personal question, sir?
- If you like.

25:36.775 --> 25:38.415
Do you ever get high?

25:39.095 --> 25:43.005
- How old do I look to you?
- Have you ever taken any drugs?

25:43.574 --> 25:44.724
Of course, Kenny.

25:45.334 --> 25:46.404
Like what?

25:47.335 --> 25:50.484
I don't feel I should be discussing this
with you on campus Mr. Potter.

25:50.574 --> 25:53.694
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

25:53.774 --> 25:57.084
- Have you ever tried mescaline?
- Not my drug of choice.

25:57.174 --> 26:00.964
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once
on mescaline. Not a good look for me.

26:01.054 --> 26:03.694
- Sir?
- I looked in the mirror.

26:03.774 --> 26:05.444
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

26:05.534 --> 26:08.094
I decided that my eyebrows
were taking over my face.

26:08.174 --> 26:09.421
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

26:09.456 --> 26:12.105
I wore a band-aid over my eye for about
six weeks while my brow grew back.

26:12.140 --> 26:12.963
Very embarrassing.

26:13.454 --> 26:16.094
- You didn't take it again after that?
- Kenny, have you been listening to me?

26:16.173 --> 26:18.404
I shaved off my eyebrow.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.404
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,
not a career on stage.

26:24.613 --> 26:28.082
If you ever want to get high sir,
I usually have some dope.

26:28.173 --> 26:30.162
You're really mad aren't you?

26:36.972 --> 26:40.316
I'm sorry, sir. I guess you don't feel
very comfortable talking like this.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.763
What makes you say that?

26:41.852 --> 26:45.162
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey.
Like this morning...

26:45.252 --> 26:48.082
...when you were listening to all that
crap we were talking about Huxley.

26:48.172 --> 26:49.212
Well, not all of you.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.252
I didn't notice you open
your mouth once.

26:51.332 --> 26:52.972
I was watching you.

26:53.052 --> 26:57.572
You let us ramble on and on
and then you straighten us out.

26:57.652 --> 27:00.852
But you never really tell us
everything you know about something.

27:01.772 --> 27:05.002
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

27:06.332 --> 27:08.051
It's not that I want to be cagey.

27:09.011 --> 27:13.081
It's just that I can't really discuss
things completely openly...

27:13.172 --> 27:14.401
...at school.

27:14.491 --> 27:16.530
Someone would misunderstand.

27:18.210 --> 27:21.200
I tried that today.
It didn't really work out.

27:27.290 --> 27:29.680
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

27:29.770 --> 27:32.000
Nothing. I was on my way
to the dean's office.

27:32.090 --> 27:34.650
You mean you walked all the way
down here just to talk to me?

27:34.730 --> 27:36.560
- Why not?
- Well...

27:36.650 --> 27:39.640
I think you deserve
something for that, sir.

27:39.730 --> 27:40.719
Here sir, take your pick.

27:42.569 --> 27:44.610
- It's on me.
- Thank you.

27:48.130 --> 27:49.690
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

27:50.650 --> 27:53.610
- Why blue?
- Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

27:53.689 --> 27:55.329
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

27:58.730 --> 28:00.079
And you? Red?

28:02.049 --> 28:04.519
- What is red stand for?
- A lot of things.

28:04.609 --> 28:06.519
Rage, lust.

28:08.048 --> 28:09.088
No kidding?

28:14.648 --> 28:15.968
Well sir, I...

28:16.048 --> 28:17.478
I guess I see you around.

29:36.605 --> 29:37.595
Hello?

29:37.685 --> 29:39.355
What are you up to, kiddo?

29:39.445 --> 29:43.045
Just trying to finish up a book.
How's your day going?

29:43.125 --> 29:44.245
Fine.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.885
I was just leaving school and wanted to
know if you needed anything for tonight.

29:47.965 --> 29:50.085
Thanks, you're sweet.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.285
But I think I'm all set.

29:53.283 --> 29:54.713
Be a darling and...

29:54.803 --> 29:59.754
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.
I love the color of the bottle.

30:00.604 --> 30:03.274
You love what's in it.
What time do you want me?

30:04.444 --> 30:06.754
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

30:06.843 --> 30:09.514
Perfect. I'll see you then.

30:09.603 --> 30:11.513
I'll see you then.
Bye, Geo.

30:11.604 --> 30:12.724
Bye, kiddo.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.313
Beautiful.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.480
- Yes, Mr. Potter?
- Are you going somewhere, sir?

31:31.561 --> 31:34.391
That is usually why people
get into their cars.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.596
No, I mean are you going on
vacation or something?

31:36.630 --> 31:38.829
- What?
- I saw you cleaning out your office.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.629
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

31:48.359 --> 31:51.749
I was just hoping that perhaps we could get
together for a drink or something sometime.

31:52.639 --> 31:54.149
Why is that?

31:55.519 --> 31:56.799
I don't know, sir.

31:57.599 --> 31:59.479
Because I think you might like it.
And...

32:01.199 --> 32:02.789
...because you seem as though
you could use a friend.

32:02.878 --> 32:05.319
- Oh really?
- Yes, sir. You do.

32:09.878 --> 32:11.678
They may be right.

32:13.158 --> 32:15.678
It will have to be another time.
I'm late.

32:17.119 --> 32:18.438
But thank you for the invitation.

32:19.598 --> 32:21.798
And thank you for the talk earlier.

32:23.198 --> 32:25.188
And stay away from the mescaline.

32:56.356 --> 32:57.756
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

32:57.837 --> 33:00.116
- Hello. How are you today?
- I'm fine, sir.

33:00.196 --> 33:02.637
- Do you need to get into your box?
- Yes, I do.

33:02.716 --> 33:03.997
Follow me.

33:12.196 --> 33:13.477
Here you are, sir.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.556
If you could please sign here...

33:25.955 --> 33:27.235
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:32.193 --> 34:34.583
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

34:35.871 --> 34:37.752
What would you like to know?

34:37.831 --> 34:40.272
I don't know.
You seem very intimate I guess.

34:41.552 --> 34:44.351
Like you were once
together or something.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.552
- You haven't slept with her, have you?
- Yes.

34:50.232 --> 34:51.302
And?

34:52.632 --> 34:54.702
A few times when we were young.

34:54.746 --> 34:56.643
I wouldn't say that it
meant nothing to me...

34:56.677 --> 34:59.233
...but it certainly meant
a great deal more to Charley.

34:59.312 --> 35:01.381
It was a long time ago in London.

35:03.111 --> 35:05.101
I love Charley.

35:05.192 --> 35:08.071
- And We were very close friends
but that's all. - Well, I'm confused.

35:09.351 --> 35:11.310
If you sleep with women
then why are you with me?

35:11.391 --> 35:13.381
Because I fall in love with men.

35:13.471 --> 35:15.461
Because I fell in love with you.

35:17.670 --> 35:19.870
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with
women when they're young?

35:19.950 --> 35:22.391
- I haven't.
- You're joking.

35:22.470 --> 35:24.620
No, I'm not.

35:24.710 --> 35:26.493
It was just never anything
that interested me.

35:26.528 --> 35:29.341
Well, you're awfully
modern aren't you?

35:29.350 --> 35:32.310
You know, I think that was the first
thing that I noticed about you...

35:33.470 --> 35:35.590
...was how sure of yourself you were.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.900
How can you be so sure about
everything at your age?

35:41.990 --> 35:43.790
You think I'm sure of myself?

35:44.349 --> 35:45.830
Of course, you are.

36:07.068 --> 36:08.658
I'm finished now.
Thank you.

36:14.268 --> 36:15.938
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

36:17.108 --> 36:18.748
Is there something else we
can help you with today?

36:18.828 --> 36:22.137
I can't find my check book
and I need some cash.

36:22.228 --> 36:24.458
Not my day I'm afraid.
Excuse me a minute.

37:16.026 --> 37:20.385
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,
but I think yours are pretty.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.586
I think yours are pretty too.

37:23.665 --> 37:27.575
Why do you look so sad?
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

37:29.185 --> 37:30.505
Ben Hur.

37:33.105 --> 37:35.095
He's our scorpion.

37:35.185 --> 37:39.175
Every night we throw in something
new to him and watch him kill it.

37:39.265 --> 37:43.414
Daddy says it's like the colosseum. So my
brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

37:43.504 --> 37:45.144
He wants to be a set designer.

37:46.104 --> 37:47.800
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

37:47.835 --> 37:50.559
...cause he's still full from
the moth we gave him last night.

37:51.464 --> 37:54.293
Daddy says he wants to throw
you in to the colosseum.

37:54.383 --> 37:56.504
No kidding?
Why?

37:56.583 --> 37:59.413
He says you're light in your loafers...

37:59.504 --> 38:01.464
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

38:01.543 --> 38:03.583
I think my brother Tom is
light in his loafers too...

38:03.664 --> 38:05.973
...but he wears Keds.

38:07.663 --> 38:11.863
He made me do a hair conditioning
treatment on my hair with eggs.

38:12.543 --> 38:14.343
Does it look shiny?

38:14.423 --> 38:16.704
Sweetheart, what are you doing
bothering Mr. Falconer?

38:16.783 --> 38:19.343
She's not bothering me at all Susan.
How are you?

38:19.423 --> 38:21.784
I'm glad to see you George.

38:23.183 --> 38:25.438
George, we're having a few people
over tonight for drinks...

38:25.473 --> 38:27.224
...and would love to have you
join us if you could.

38:27.303 --> 38:31.983
- Thank you. That's very kind of you but I
have plans. - Another time then.

38:32.063 --> 38:34.533
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get
back to his banking.

38:34.623 --> 38:35.851
Goodbye, George.

38:35.942 --> 38:37.742
Bye, Susan.
Bye, Jennifer.

38:46.941 --> 38:50.621
- May I help you, sir? - I'd like to buy
some bullets for this gun, please.

38:50.702 --> 38:54.382
Yes, sir.
This is a really old gun, sir.

38:54.461 --> 38:56.691
We have a two for one sale on
handguns at the moment.

38:56.781 --> 39:00.851
- Perhaps one for the little lady?
- No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

39:02.741 --> 39:05.461
- Here you go. Anything else?
- No, thank you.

39:05.541 --> 39:07.501
That would be $2.29, sir.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.661
Thank you.

39:47.939 --> 39:50.819
I'm sorry. I hope she
didn't growl at you.

39:50.899 --> 39:53.019
She goes a little crazy sometimes when
I have to leave her in the car.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.849
She's perfect.
What's her name?

39:54.939 --> 39:56.689
India.

39:56.779 --> 39:58.289
Let's go there.

40:02.779 --> 40:05.089
You little baby.

40:07.698 --> 40:11.739
I used to have smooth fox terriers.
You don't see them very often.

40:31.537 --> 40:33.447
The very smell of buttered toast.

40:34.697 --> 40:36.047
She's still a puppy isn't she?

40:42.257 --> 40:43.487
Well.

40:43.577 --> 40:45.697
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.097
Good night, India.

40:59.696 --> 41:02.086
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, It's ok.

41:02.176 --> 41:06.376
- It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.
- It's ok. Don't worry.

41:06.457 --> 41:08.336
No, no I insist.

41:13.015 --> 41:14.495
Thank you.

41:14.576 --> 41:16.245
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.695
- Here you go.
- Thanks man.

41:20.335 --> 41:21.815
You want one?

41:22.575 --> 41:24.485
No, thanks.

41:25.535 --> 41:27.255
Actually, yes.
Why not?

41:27.894 --> 41:29.045
Thank you.

41:59.414 --> 42:01.134
- Carlos.
- What did you say?

42:01.214 --> 42:03.604
Carlos. You asked me my name.

42:03.694 --> 42:05.573
Are you okay?

42:05.653 --> 42:07.323
Yeah.

42:08.253 --> 42:09.653
Yeah, I'm sorry.

42:13.859 --> 42:15.306
You're really something.

42:15.732 --> 42:17.892
You have an incredible face.

42:18.190 --> 42:20.703
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

42:20.750 --> 42:22.132
Your Spanish is perfect.

42:22.252 --> 42:23.533
Thank you.

42:26.942 --> 42:29.083
I should have used it more.

42:29.562 --> 42:30.566
Well...

42:30.806 --> 42:32.593
It's not too late.

42:58.611 --> 42:59.840
What are you doing?

43:00.770 --> 43:03.081
Aren't we going somewhere?

43:03.171 --> 43:05.891
No. But, thanks.

43:11.252 --> 43:14.336
You know, it's the smog that
makes it that color.

43:14.370 --> 43:16.450
I've never seen a sky like this before.

43:17.842 --> 43:21.432
Sometimes awful things have
their own kind of beauty.

43:26.210 --> 43:27.640
Could I have another cigarette?

43:27.730 --> 43:29.240
Sure.

43:56.328 --> 43:59.048
- Are sure that you don't want to go
for a drive? - I'm sure.

44:02.488 --> 44:04.238
- Where are you from?
- Madrid.

44:04.328 --> 44:06.928
Madrid?
How did you get here?

44:07.008 --> 44:08.758
It's a long story.

44:08.848 --> 44:11.808
I met a guy from LA at the
hotel where I worked...

44:11.888 --> 44:15.248
...who told me I could live with him
and that he could get me an agent.

44:15.328 --> 44:17.888
But he never realized that
I have a Spanish accent.

44:19.408 --> 44:22.638
I like your accent.
You speak very well.

44:23.847 --> 44:28.688
- How did you learn English? - My mom had
an American boyfriend when I was little.

44:28.768 --> 44:30.838
Is your mother in Madrid?

44:31.567 --> 44:33.288
Yes, she is.
She cuts hair.

44:33.368 --> 44:36.568
She cut my hair before I left.
Do you like it?

44:38.328 --> 44:41.526
- I thought it made me look like James Dean.
- You are better than James Dean.

44:41.606 --> 44:43.007
Really?

44:43.086 --> 44:44.597
Thanks.

44:48.606 --> 44:51.356
No one has ever picked me up
and not wanted something.

44:51.446 --> 44:53.036
I think you picked me up.

44:55.006 --> 44:56.726
This is kind of a serious day for me.

44:57.726 --> 45:01.005
Come on. What could be
so serious for a guy like you?

45:02.326 --> 45:06.236
I'm just trying to get over
an old love I guess.

45:07.846 --> 45:11.126
My mother says that
lovers are like buses.

45:11.206 --> 45:13.846
You just have to wait a little while
and another one comes along.

45:20.245 --> 45:21.915
I have to go.

45:23.236 --> 45:24.410
You're a nice guy.

45:24.730 --> 45:26.314
I hope you find...

45:26.507 --> 45:28.184
...someone like you.

45:28.205 --> 45:29.955
Thanks.

45:30.045 --> 45:32.355
I'm going away.

46:27.121 --> 46:29.482
It's your turn to change it.

46:29.562 --> 46:32.081
Yeah, I'm not changing it.
It's your turn.

46:32.162 --> 46:34.471
Besides, you never like
what I put on anyway.

46:34.561 --> 46:37.362
I'll give you five dollars if you
change it. I'm too old to get up.

46:37.441 --> 46:39.352
You're only old when it's
convenient for you to be old.

46:39.442 --> 46:42.081
What are you reading anyway?

46:42.162 --> 46:44.471
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

46:44.561 --> 46:46.121
It's for my class.

46:47.601 --> 46:49.641
What highbrow work of fiction
might you be reading?

46:52.281 --> 46:54.321
Don't be so smug.

46:57.801 --> 46:59.361
Man, what a life he has.

47:00.442 --> 47:02.401
- Don't you just envy him?
- Why?

47:02.481 --> 47:04.441
Because he can sniff
anyone's arse he wants?

47:05.841 --> 47:07.591
Nice.

47:07.681 --> 47:11.471
No, because he just does what he wants.
Like yesterday...

47:11.560 --> 47:14.440
...I was standing in the front yard
and Susan came over to talk.

47:14.521 --> 47:16.881
And that little brat of hers
Christopher came...

47:16.916 --> 47:18.991
...running over waving that
damned gun of his around.

47:19.080 --> 47:23.040
And our little dog walked
right up, hiked his leg...

47:23.119 --> 47:25.559
...and peed all over Christopher's
new tennis shoes.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.159
All over Christopher actually.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.630
And of course, I had
to act like I was upset

47:30.720 --> 47:33.629
It was so perfectly executed
you should have seen it.

47:33.719 --> 47:36.389
After all the times those kids
have tortured that poor dog.

47:37.679 --> 47:39.800
I mean, you should take a
lesson from him. They don't...

47:39.879 --> 47:42.439
They don't stay up all night worrying.

47:42.519 --> 47:46.069
They figured out how to get the two
of us to do exactly what they want.

47:46.159 --> 47:50.716
They are basically very sophisticated
little parasites when you think about it.

47:50.751 --> 47:54.399
Well, the dumbest creatures are the
happiest. Just look at your mother.

47:57.359 --> 47:59.319
He's really just living the moment.

48:01.319 --> 48:02.959
It's like now.

48:03.039 --> 48:05.559
What could be better than
being tucked up here with you?

48:09.279 --> 48:12.637
If I died right now it would be OK.

48:14.638 --> 48:19.558
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me so why don't
you shut up and go change the record.

48:21.358 --> 48:23.477
Good answer.

48:24.301 --> 48:25.644
You know what? I was thinking
about taking them up...

48:25.678 --> 48:28.518
...to Denver with me next week
if it's okay with you.

48:28.717 --> 48:30.068
It's my mom.
She loves them.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.437
Probably that recognition
of a similar mind.

48:36.797 --> 48:38.677
You stay there, old man.

52:14.588 --> 52:18.818
No, I did not forget the gin.
I'll see you in ten minutes.

53:01.346 --> 53:04.025
Christopher, would you
like it if I killed you?

53:04.061 --> 53:05.156
I don't know.

53:05.191 --> 53:07.666
If you keep this up
we're going to find out.

53:07.745 --> 53:10.706
So, why don't you go home
and stop shooting people?

53:40.384 --> 53:42.104
I'm so happy to see you.

53:47.184 --> 53:48.694
Come on in.

53:51.343 --> 53:54.064
It smells wonderful.
I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

53:54.144 --> 53:56.703
I gave her the night off.
I'm cooking myself.

53:56.784 --> 53:58.853
- You are?
- Yes, I'm trying something new.

53:58.944 --> 54:01.663
- Charley darling, ''you cooking' is new.
- Don't be smart.

54:01.744 --> 54:04.464
I'm in a good mood tonight.
I'm going to be fun.

54:04.543 --> 54:07.103
I've already made two
New Year's resolutions.

54:07.183 --> 54:10.402
Resolution one: No more talk
that of awful ex-husbands...

54:10.437 --> 54:12.264
..and children who don't give a damn.

54:12.343 --> 54:13.573
- And the other one?
- One what?

54:13.664 --> 54:15.303
Resolution.

54:15.383 --> 54:20.062
Resolution two: More smoking and more
drinking and screw it all! So come on...

54:20.142 --> 54:21.542
...mix me up a drink.

54:21.622 --> 54:23.532
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

54:23.622 --> 54:25.662
- And watch out baby!
- Coming up.

54:30.302 --> 54:34.342
- It was sweet of you to come tonight.
- Sweet had nothing to do with it.

54:35.262 --> 54:39.221
- I needed to see you.
- Come off it.

54:39.302 --> 54:42.451
Whenever you do something sweet
you're too ashamed to admit it.

54:43.861 --> 54:46.501
Here is to our early
New Year's resolutions.

54:48.622 --> 54:50.371
Cheers.

54:51.741 --> 54:53.652
What are your resolutions by the way?

54:55.222 --> 54:59.931
To let go of the past completely,
entirely, and forever.

55:02.061 --> 55:03.621
Light me up, will you?

55:11.460 --> 55:14.130
Darling, you dont look well.

55:14.220 --> 55:16.885
Do you remember that little
heart attack you had last year?

55:16.919 --> 55:19.140
- It wasnt a heart attack.
- Well whatever it was darling...

55:19.220 --> 55:20.969
...you dont look so hot.

55:21.059 --> 55:24.210
Im fine.
I never felt better.

55:24.300 --> 55:28.089
- I'm a little tired. I haven't
been sleeping... - Geo, it's normal.

55:28.179 --> 55:30.009
You were with Jim for 16 years.

55:30.099 --> 55:32.699
I think about Richard every day.

55:32.780 --> 55:34.449
Its hard being alone.

55:35.859 --> 55:38.820
At least you have a job and a life.

55:40.060 --> 55:42.369
Lets have a bit of dinner shall we?

55:42.459 --> 55:46.689
Because Ive worked so very hard.

55:48.099 --> 55:51.059
- What are you talking about? - Seriously,
there no such thing as old anymore.

55:51.139 --> 55:54.979
The other day one of my students
has called me a senior citizen.

55:55.059 --> 55:56.888
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

55:56.924 --> 55:59.850
...but I'm not sure senior is
what I'm aiming for either.

55:59.939 --> 56:02.378
It's all becoming so bland.
It's not why I came to America.

56:02.457 --> 56:04.657
It's like a complete breakdown
of culture and manners.

56:04.738 --> 56:07.338
The young ones have no manners.

56:07.417 --> 56:11.327
The other day at the car wash
a young man looked me up and down...

56:11.417 --> 56:13.697
...and actually asked me if I
was a natural blonde.

56:13.778 --> 56:15.687
- What did you say?
- I looked him straight in the eye...

56:15.777 --> 56:19.327
...and said: ''Let's just say
if I stood on my head...

56:19.418 --> 56:21.058
...I would be a natural
brunette with lovely breath.

56:21.137 --> 56:23.097
- You didn't!
- I did!

56:24.977 --> 56:29.607
And the amusing thing was
that it went right over his head!

56:29.697 --> 56:32.087
You know, you had a mouth on you
even back in London.

56:32.177 --> 56:34.697
Do you remember that old lesbian
who threw her drink over your head...

56:34.777 --> 56:37.377
...because you asked her if
she was hung like a donut.

56:47.296 --> 56:48.857
Geo.

56:48.936 --> 56:51.326
We could always go back to London.
The two of us.

56:51.416 --> 56:54.855
- No, thanks.
- You know you miss it.

56:54.936 --> 56:55.845
I miss it sometimes.

56:57.175 --> 56:59.165
Maybe if Jim had lived.

56:59.255 --> 57:02.056
He loved being in England. He asked us
to stay the last time we were there.

57:02.135 --> 57:04.525
Do you really think you
would have moved?

57:06.375 --> 57:09.175
I don't know. It's silly to even talk
about it. It was only a fantasy.

57:17.174 --> 57:18.845
What's this?

57:18.935 --> 57:20.975
It's my mother's wedding ring.

57:21.815 --> 57:24.045
I found it a drawer
when I was cleaning out.

57:30.735 --> 57:33.374
Charley my dear, you and I are
both in need of another drink.

59:01.450 --> 59:03.330
Wait!
Wait, wait!

59:12.491 --> 59:14.400
I love this!

59:14.490 --> 59:16.770
- You're insane!
- Come on, old man!

01:00:33.247 --> 01:00:34.756
Don't move.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.516
Thank you.

01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:57.845
- Very smooth cigarette move.
- I've always wanted to do that.

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:00.676
You don't even smoke.

01:01:00.766 --> 01:01:03.205
Well, not for the last
sixteen years. Jim hated it.

01:01:04.165 --> 01:01:06.916
What's to stop me now?
It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:16.484
This is so nice, lying here with you.

01:01:18.484 --> 01:01:20.101
Don't you ever miss this?

01:01:21.062 --> 01:01:23.211
What we could have been to each other?

01:01:23.764 --> 01:01:26.485
Having a real relationship and kids?

01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:33.844
- I had Jim.
- I know, but I mean a real relationship.

01:01:34.742 --> 01:01:38.684
Geo, let's be honest, what you and Jim
had together was wonderful but...

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:42.644
...wasn't it really just a
substitute for something else?

01:01:45.764 --> 01:01:48.484
Is that really what you think
after all of these years?

01:01:50.564 --> 01:01:54.794
You think Jim was just some
kind of substitute for real love?

01:01:58.444 --> 01:02:01.833
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

01:02:02.923 --> 01:02:04.324
Do you understand?

01:02:04.403 --> 01:02:06.411
There is no substitute for Jim...

01:02:06.446 --> 01:02:08.233
...anywhere!

01:02:08.322 --> 01:02:11.008
And by the way, what is so real
about your relationship with Richard?

01:02:11.043 --> 01:02:13.873
He left you after nine years!

01:02:14.842 --> 01:02:16.938
Jim and I were together
for sixteen years!

01:02:16.973 --> 01:02:19.192
And if he hadn't died we
would still be together!

01:02:19.282 --> 01:02:20.762
What the hell is not real about that?

01:02:20.842 --> 01:02:23.282
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:02:23.362 --> 01:02:25.881
I know how much the two
of you loved each other.

01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:30.351
I suppose I'm just jealous that
you and I never had that kind of love.

01:02:33.441 --> 01:02:36.402
Actually, I've never had that
kind of love with anybody.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.402
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:41.904
...except for the way I looked.

01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:43.781
And Clay...

01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:45.945
I don't know. You raise
a child and love it...

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.949
...and then when they are
old enough they just leave.

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:50.615
Charley, there is nothing
wrong with your life.

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:53.529
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.
It's one of your great pleasures.

01:02:53.564 --> 01:02:55.551
And it's not one of yours?

01:02:55.669 --> 01:02:57.536
You're as pathetic as I am.

01:02:57.571 --> 01:03:00.408
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely
not one of my great pleasures.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.524
Well, it's not one of mine either. I don't
like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:05.270
I tried to hold onto
Richard for so long...

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.400
...even when it was obvious to
everyone but me that it was over.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.878
And now Clay is grown up.

01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:11.320
I mean, what am I doing here Geo?
Tell me, what?

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.630
You have plenty of friends.
You'll be fine.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.278
Yes, I have friends.
But none of them need me.

01:03:16.312 --> 01:03:19.770
And yes I have you and if you weren't such a
goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.470
I only have you now
because you lost Jim.

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:31.599
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.
It's not as easy for a woman.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.436
I've done everything the way
I was supposed to and...

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:35.599
...all I have to keep me
company is a bottle of gin.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.712
Maybe you should try
donuts with your gin.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:40.839
Screw you.

01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:46.069
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.449
I swear you really almost had me.

01:03:47.484 --> 01:03:51.279
A tiny tear was beginning to
form in the corner of my eye.

01:03:51.358 --> 01:03:52.918
Now stop it.

01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:55.878
You are still
breathtakingly beautiful.

01:03:57.118 --> 01:03:59.019
When you can be bothered
to get up and out of bed...

01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:01.999
...and you stop whimpering about
everything for five minutes.

01:04:02.678 --> 01:04:05.507
Go to London.
Change your life.

01:04:05.597 --> 01:04:07.957
If you're not happy being a woman
then stop acting like one.

01:04:08.038 --> 01:04:09.437
You have all the answers.

01:04:10.837 --> 01:04:13.037
No, I don't have any to mention.

01:04:13.118 --> 01:04:15.867
If you're so smart why don't you
have something new in your life?

01:04:15.957 --> 01:04:17.137
Take that position at Stanford.

01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:20.037
You complain about that little school
but you could go anywhere you want.

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:22.427
I think what I've done
has been worthwhile.

01:04:22.517 --> 01:04:24.667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:26.827
I shouldn't have said that.

01:04:27.757 --> 01:04:30.227
As much as I dread it, I think
I will go back to London.

01:04:30.317 --> 01:04:32.147
Why do you dread it?

01:04:32.237 --> 01:04:35.627
When I lived in London last I was
young. I was fresh, I was everything.

01:04:36.797 --> 01:04:40.427
Coming to America was such a dream,
it was the icing on the cake.

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:42.797
Going home is defeat.

01:04:42.877 --> 01:04:45.395
None of it really worked
out the way I'd planned.

01:04:45.476 --> 01:04:48.356
Most things don't work out
the way people plan.

01:04:50.276 --> 01:04:53.235
You're just living in the past. You need
to start thinking about your future.

01:04:53.315 --> 01:04:56.276
Living in the past is my future.

01:04:57.075 --> 01:04:59.876
It doesn't have to be yours.
You're a man.

01:05:01.155 --> 01:05:03.305
And you're a bore tonight.

01:05:04.355 --> 01:05:07.505
Can't we just feel sorry for
ourselves a little bit longer?

01:05:07.595 --> 01:05:09.294
Let's have another drink.

01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:12.276
- I don't think so. I have to go. Come on.
Walk me out. - Please, please!

01:05:12.355 --> 01:05:14.752
- Come on, I have to!
- No, this was such fun! No.

01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:25.185
When will I see you again?

01:05:27.395 --> 01:05:30.465
- Aren't you going to England?
- I'll never do that!

01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:32.434
It's far too much effort.

01:05:33.234 --> 01:05:38.103
Besides, I don't think Jim would want me
to leave you here in LA all alone.

01:05:38.729 --> 01:05:42.088
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I've got all the answers. Remember?

01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:44.714
What are you doing this weekend?

01:05:45.954 --> 01:05:48.473
I think I might just be very quiet.

01:05:50.233 --> 01:05:53.593
You never really did take me
seriously, did you George?

01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:56.663
I tried to Charley. Remember?
A long time ago.

01:05:58.353 --> 01:06:00.232
It didn't really work out, did it?

01:06:02.432 --> 01:06:03.783
No, Charley.

01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:12.032
Sleep tight.

01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:57.391
Patrick, a beer and a
packet of Lucky Strike, please.

01:07:40.218 --> 01:07:41.590
Excuse me.

01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:58.308
It's too hot in there.

01:07:58.388 --> 01:07:59.788
Yes, it is.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.428
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No thanks, I don't smoke.

01:08:03.988 --> 01:08:07.748
- This place is really crowded.
- Well, it is Saturday night.

01:08:08.908 --> 01:08:10.322
It's usually as bad as this.

01:08:10.357 --> 01:08:14.267
People normally just stop by and pick
someone up and then head on down the beach.

01:08:14.347 --> 01:08:16.256
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

01:08:16.346 --> 01:08:19.017
I'm surprised the cops
don't break it up.

01:08:19.107 --> 01:08:21.546
- Is it always like that?
- Since the war ended.

01:08:22.586 --> 01:08:24.984
It's pretty great actually.
It's kind of pagan.

01:08:26.426 --> 01:08:28.466
- I'm Jim.
- I'm George.

01:08:28.546 --> 01:08:29.578
Pleased to meet you Jim.

01:08:29.615 --> 01:08:32.697
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some
friends but I can't find them.

01:08:32.786 --> 01:08:37.227
I just needed to get out of the house
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

01:08:37.872 --> 01:08:39.049
Do you live hereby?

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:40.616
Canyon.

01:08:40.706 --> 01:08:42.776
- For how long?
- Since 38.

01:08:42.867 --> 01:08:44.935
- Where are you from?
- Colorado.

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:49.488
I really like it here.
It's close to beach.

01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:53.456
I think I might stay after
I'm discharged.

01:08:54.225 --> 01:08:57.055
I don't know, maybe
I'm a bit of a pagan.

01:09:01.394 --> 01:09:03.122
- After you.
- No.

01:09:09.305 --> 01:09:10.814
Sorry.

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:20.305
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

01:09:21.863 --> 01:09:23.935
Do you buy me a drink?

01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:27.453
I think I'm taken.

01:09:28.783 --> 01:09:31.694
Too bad, too bad.

01:09:34.144 --> 01:09:36.502
Do you want another beer?

01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:34.661
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and
a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

01:10:44.102 --> 01:10:45.691
Patrick, cancel that.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.690
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.740
Hello, sir.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.570
- What are we drinking?
- Scotch.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.529
Okay.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.170
I come here all the time. I live just
around the corner, but then you knew that.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.979
On Camphor Tree Lane.

01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:26.779
You're still carrying that around.

01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:31.179
One must always appreciate
life's little gifts.

01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:37.180
So, what are you doing here?

01:11:37.939 --> 01:11:39.873
- Just out for a ride on my bike.
- Is that all?

01:11:41.059 --> 01:11:42.048
I don't know.

01:11:42.138 --> 01:11:43.728
Were you looking for me?

01:11:44.578 --> 01:11:46.488
Maybe. I don't know.

01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:48.928
I feel like my head's
stopped up with stuff.

01:11:49.018 --> 01:11:50.157
What kind of stuff?

01:11:50.192 --> 01:11:52.544
Like, the stuff you were talking
about today in class.

01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:54.288
That is definitely not important.

01:11:54.378 --> 01:11:56.768
No, it is important.
Your class is great.

01:11:56.858 --> 01:12:01.217
But somehow we always seem
to get stuck talking about the past.

01:12:01.298 --> 01:12:02.857
The past just doesn't matter to me.

01:12:02.938 --> 01:12:06.618
- The present?
- I can't wait for the present to be over.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.608
It's a total drag.

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:11.537
Well, tonight is the exception.

01:12:12.938 --> 01:12:14.767
What?

01:12:14.857 --> 01:12:17.737
Tonight, yes!
The present, no!

01:12:18.497 --> 01:12:19.777
Let's drink to tonight.

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:21.977
Tonight.

01:12:23.777 --> 01:12:25.824
So if the past doesn't matter and
the present is a total drag.

01:12:25.859 --> 01:12:27.688
What about the future?

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:31.297
What future?
Cuba might just blow us up.

01:12:31.377 --> 01:12:32.941
Death is the future.

01:12:32.976 --> 01:12:34.790
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be depressing.

01:12:34.856 --> 01:12:37.001
It's not depressing.
It's not depressing, it's true.

01:12:37.036 --> 01:12:40.002
It may not be your immediate future
but it's what we all share.

01:12:40.736 --> 01:12:42.086
Death is the future.

01:12:42.176 --> 01:12:44.166
You're right, I guess.

01:12:44.255 --> 01:12:47.151
If one is not enjoying one's present
there isn't a great deal to...

01:12:47.187 --> 01:12:49.134
...suggest that the future
should be any better.

01:12:49.805 --> 01:12:51.551
Yeah, I've thought that before.

01:12:52.255 --> 01:12:55.406
But the thing is you just never know.

01:12:56.255 --> 01:12:57.485
Look at tonight.

01:13:01.455 --> 01:13:03.095
Actually...

01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:05.566
...I feel really alone most of the time.

01:13:06.112 --> 01:13:07.725
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:13:08.695 --> 01:13:10.271
I've always felt this way.

01:13:10.306 --> 01:13:13.605
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

01:13:13.695 --> 01:13:18.055
And while we're here we are absolutely,
completely sealed in our own bodies.

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.684
Really weird.

01:13:21.735 --> 01:13:24.294
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:29.084
We can only experience the outside world
through our own slanted perception of it.

01:13:30.733 --> 01:13:32.804
Who knows what you're really like?

01:13:32.894 --> 01:13:37.093
- I just see what I think you're like.
- I'm exactly what I appear to be.

01:13:39.733 --> 01:13:42.013
If you look closely.

01:13:47.454 --> 01:13:50.923
You know the only thing that has made
the whole thing worthwhile...

01:13:51.933 --> 01:13:53.413
...has been those...

01:13:54.093 --> 01:13:58.242
...few times that I've been able to really,
truly connect with another human being.

01:14:01.453 --> 01:14:03.283
I had a hunch about you, sir.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.203
- You did?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:06.012 --> 01:14:08.653
I had a hunch you might
be a real romantic.

01:14:13.852 --> 01:14:16.603
You know, everyone
keeps telling you that...

01:14:16.692 --> 01:14:19.371
...when you're older, that you'll
have all this experience.

01:14:19.405 --> 01:14:21.076
Like it's some great thing.

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.526
That's a load of shit.

01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:25.233
I think I've actually just
gotten sillier and sillier.

01:14:25.269 --> 01:14:27.411
- Really?
- Absolutely.

01:14:27.492 --> 01:14:30.161
So, all your experience is useless.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.361
No, I wouldn't say that.

01:14:34.171 --> 01:14:37.174
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:
Experience is not what happens to a man.

01:14:37.209 --> 01:14:39.938
It is what a man does
with what happens to him.

01:14:41.691 --> 01:14:43.491
- Let's go swimming.
- Okay.

01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:47.571
- What?
- It was a test.

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:50.290
I thought you were
bluffing about being silly so...

01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:55.081
...I said to myself I'll suggest doing
something completely outrageous.

01:14:55.171 --> 01:14:59.370
And if he resists, if he even hesitates
then I know he's full of shit.

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:03.160
Well, I wasn't.
Were you?

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:05.771
Hell, no!

01:15:22.889 --> 01:15:25.009
Come on sir.
I'll help you down.

01:15:26.809 --> 01:15:28.289
Let's go.

01:16:12.487 --> 01:16:14.287
Come on, sir.

01:16:46.366 --> 01:16:48.276
Sir?

01:16:48.806 --> 01:16:50.446
Sir?

01:16:59.925 --> 01:17:02.395
That's enough for now, sir.

01:17:03.044 --> 01:17:05.605
- I'm fine.
- I'm cold. Come on.

01:17:18.525 --> 01:17:20.194
Can we go back to your place, sir?

01:17:20.285 --> 01:17:22.724
Of course.
Where else?

01:17:23.884 --> 01:17:25.925
- Where else.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:17:26.004 --> 01:17:29.794
- What's the matter?
- You can't get home like that!

01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:31.684
We're invisible, don't you know that?

01:17:33.644 --> 01:17:36.122
You know sir, they ought not
to let you out on your own.

01:17:36.362 --> 01:17:38.194
You're liable to get into real trouble.

01:17:38.484 --> 01:17:40.634
I excel at it.

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:42.683
Your forehead is bleeding.

01:18:05.602 --> 01:18:09.123
The bathroom is just down the hall
if you would like to take a shower.

01:18:09.202 --> 01:18:11.482
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.792
I'm fine. I'm English.
We like to be cold and wet.

01:18:14.882 --> 01:18:17.252
First, I think that we need
to take care of that cut, sir.

01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:18.739
Do you have any band-aids?

01:18:22.562 --> 01:18:25.660
- Going camping, sir?
- I'm fine, really.

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:28.761
Stay there.
I'll be right back.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.670
Sit up.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.919
Tilt your head back.

01:19:39.758 --> 01:19:42.210
Well sir, I'm afraid this
time you don't have...

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.935
...the excuse of mescaline
to explain your band-aid.

01:19:46.637 --> 01:19:49.198
I think we should get you
out of those wet clothes.

01:19:51.638 --> 01:19:53.068
Yes, sir.

01:21:22.354 --> 01:21:25.343
- You're not too cold?
- I'm great.

01:21:25.434 --> 01:21:28.184
- Would you like a drink?
- A beer, sir. If you have one.

01:21:28.273 --> 01:21:31.024
I'm afraid that's all we have.

01:21:31.114 --> 01:21:32.704
Two beers coming up.

01:21:46.433 --> 01:21:49.073
- You live here all by yourself, sir?
- I do now.

01:21:49.153 --> 01:21:51.983
I used to share this place with
a friend. He was an architect.

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:55.805
Man, guys my age dream about the
kind of setup you've got here.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.513
I mean, what more can you want?

01:21:58.593 --> 01:22:01.983
You get to be left alone and
come and go as you please.

01:22:03.633 --> 01:22:05.344
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:07.345
What's the matter, sir?
Don't you believe me?

01:22:07.873 --> 01:22:09.896
If you're so keen on the
idea living by yourself...

01:22:09.931 --> 01:22:11.718
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

01:22:11.839 --> 01:22:14.887
Lois? What's she got to
do with anything?

01:22:15.471 --> 01:22:17.465
I got the impression that you
and she were together.

01:22:20.591 --> 01:22:23.792
Not really.
She is kind of cool and...

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.311
...we're good friends but...

01:22:28.271 --> 01:22:31.101
I think what you really want to
ask me is if we sleep together.

01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:34.741
- And do you?
- We did. Once.

01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:38.951
- Why only once?
- I didn't say only once, I said once.

01:22:40.151 --> 01:22:42.821
Come on, the last thing I want to
talk about right now is Lois.

01:22:42.911 --> 01:22:44.341
What time is it?

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.871
My watch seems to have stopped.

01:22:55.551 --> 01:22:57.060
Do you want me to go?

01:22:57.990 --> 01:23:00.461
You must be kidding.
Go, get us another beer.

01:23:01.989 --> 01:23:03.789
Is that an order, sir?

01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:06.650
You're damn right it is.

01:23:17.989 --> 01:23:19.629
Pathetic.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.789
Did you say something, sir?

01:23:27.028 --> 01:23:28.459
Why are you here?

01:23:30.549 --> 01:23:35.859
Why did you get to the office and
ask secretary for my address?

01:23:37.309 --> 01:23:41.525
I just wanted to see you
someplace other than school.

01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:44.298
Why?

01:23:47.309 --> 01:23:51.096
Sometimes I think I'm crazy cause I see
things so differently than everyone else.

01:23:52.338 --> 01:23:54.017
I feel like I can talk to you.

01:23:55.386 --> 01:23:58.307
To be honest sir, I was also
worried about you today.

01:24:03.067 --> 01:24:04.497
Me?

01:24:04.587 --> 01:24:07.257
What's to be worried about?

01:24:07.987 --> 01:24:09.467
I'm fine.

01:24:18.147 --> 01:24:19.656
I'm...

01:24:20.826 --> 01:24:22.306
I'm fine.

01:26:59.444 --> 01:27:03.797
<i>A few times in my life I've had
moments of absolute clarity.</i>

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.548
<i>When for a few brief seconds...</i>

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:11.556
<i>...the silence drowns out the noise...</i>

01:27:11.591 --> 01:27:14.835
<i>...and I can feel rather than think.</i>

01:27:15.659 --> 01:27:17.730
<i>And things seem so sharp...</i>

01:27:18.659 --> 01:27:20.649
<i>And the world seems so fresh...</i>

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.339
<i>...as though it had all
just come into existence.</i>

01:27:44.577 --> 01:27:46.646
<i>I can never make these moments last.</i>

01:27:47.684 --> 01:27:48.998
<i>I cling to them...</i>

01:27:49.033 --> 01:27:51.118
<i>...but like everything they fade.</i>

01:27:53.097 --> 01:27:55.247
<i>I've lived my live on these moments.</i>

01:27:56.657 --> 01:27:58.378
<i>They pull me back to the present...</i>

01:28:00.497 --> 01:28:05.141
<i>...and I realize that everything is
exactly the way it was meant to be.</i>

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:22.607
<i>And just like that it came.</i>

01:30:29.355 --> 01:30:32.951
