00:02.376 --> 00:05.126
(train rumbling)

00:07.822 --> 00:10.572
(peaceful music)

00:21.517 --> 00:22.940
- [Announcer] Please stand clear.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.773
The doors are closing.

01:12.358 --> 01:15.108
(birds chirping)

01:59.847 --> 02:02.144
- Hi.
- Good morning.

02:02.144 --> 02:03.700
- [Lila] Lila, nice to meet you.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.767
- Nice to see you.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.070
- Well, it's a beautiful day out.

02:08.070 --> 02:09.350
I hope that's a good omen.

02:09.350 --> 02:10.183
(laughing)

02:10.183 --> 02:11.520
- Did you have any trouble
finding a parking space?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.470
- Oh, no not at all.

02:13.470 --> 02:14.560
These facilities are great.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.140
I can't wait to settle in.

02:16.140 --> 02:17.690
- Well we're very happy to have you.

02:17.690 --> 02:18.690
I mean, your previous school

02:18.690 --> 02:21.160
just speaks glowingly of
your teaching methods.

02:21.160 --> 02:21.993
- Yeah.

02:21.993 --> 02:25.110
I'll miss them but it was
definitely time to move on.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.060
- Shannen, I want you to meet Miss Kendy.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.230
She'll be taking over Pauline's classroom.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.280
Miss James is right across
the hall if you need anything.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.113
- Oh great.

02:32.113 --> 02:33.200
Lila, nice to meet you.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.033
- Well, if you'll excuse me,

02:34.033 --> 02:35.500
I have a parent meeting to get to.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.520
So enjoy your first day.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.270
- Okay, thank you Principal Gibney.

02:39.108 --> 02:41.530
- Well, don't you just
have the sweetest manners.

02:41.530 --> 02:42.363
If you need me.

02:43.942 --> 02:44.775
- Okay.

02:45.902 --> 02:48.652
(sirens wailing)

02:51.157 --> 02:53.990
(dissonant music)

03:06.487 --> 03:07.346
- You wanna stay in that school,

03:07.346 --> 03:08.487
you gotta get your grades up

03:08.487 --> 03:09.620
and you gotta cut out all

03:09.620 --> 03:11.440
that other shit you're getting into.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.920
You think we're stupid?

03:12.920 --> 03:13.753
We know.

03:13.753 --> 03:16.460
- What makes you think I
wanna stay in that school?

03:16.460 --> 03:18.360
- [Shelly] Why should we waste
good money on that school

03:18.360 --> 03:20.150
if you're just gonna
piss away your chance?

03:20.150 --> 03:21.810
- And stop acting like
you're paying for it.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.020
We all know the church is.

03:23.020 --> 03:23.939
- [John] Hey, watch your mouth.

03:23.939 --> 03:24.772
- What, it's true.

03:24.772 --> 03:25.940
- Okay, that makes it even worse.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.580
You're wasting God's money, Jason.

03:27.580 --> 03:29.290
- Oh my god.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.710
- Do you wanna end up like your brother?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.033
- I'm not Michael!

03:36.710 --> 03:38.223
I actually had friends there.

03:39.098 --> 03:40.640
I kinda liked that school.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.720
- Please Jason, can't you
see they're not good for you?

03:42.720 --> 03:45.481
You need to stay away from them.

03:45.481 --> 03:46.951
- You're so fucking clueless.

03:46.951 --> 03:48.284
- That's enough!

03:57.870 --> 04:00.160
- Jason, we just love you

04:00.160 --> 04:01.913
and want what's best for you.

04:04.470 --> 04:07.013
Please, just try and do better at school.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.120
- [Student] Hey.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.660
Yeah, you always find the spots

04:29.660 --> 04:30.923
with no security cameras.

04:32.452 --> 04:33.285
- No, it's 50.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.380
- Are you serious?

04:36.380 --> 04:38.268
- That's the price.

04:38.268 --> 04:39.496
- What?

04:39.496 --> 04:43.350
- Dude, don't act like
you don't have the money.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.450
Do you want it or not?

04:47.650 --> 04:49.970
- What's with the raise in price?

04:49.970 --> 04:50.803
- Inflation.

05:03.693 --> 05:06.276
It's a pleasure doing business.

05:10.474 --> 05:12.891
(bell rings)

05:18.560 --> 05:19.570
- Good morning, everybody.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.783
My name is Ms Kendy.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.896
And I am your new English teacher.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.620
(students whistling)

05:30.620 --> 05:31.840
All right, settle down.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.893
Let's get started.

05:38.310 --> 05:40.280
- [Andrew] Hope they didn't
give you too much trouble.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.270
- Are you kidding?

05:41.270 --> 05:43.565
Compared to my last
school, they're a dream.

05:43.565 --> 05:44.398
- Oh.

05:44.398 --> 05:45.231
Mr. Matthews.

05:45.231 --> 05:46.573
Just call me Andrew.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.473
- Lila.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.773
You can call me Ms Kendy.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.430
- Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.830
I'm off to coach a basketball practice.

05:55.830 --> 05:56.890
I'll see you in the halls.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.723
- You will.

06:01.388 --> 06:02.707
(laughing)

06:02.707 --> 06:03.540
- With this brown bag.

06:06.490 --> 06:07.323
- Put it over her fucking head.

06:08.793 --> 06:11.270
- Jason, man, hurry the fuck up.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.800
- Fuck you.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.244
Ah, fuck.

06:14.244 --> 06:16.242
I'm trying to imbibe the vibe, man.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.178
- What the fuck?

06:17.178 --> 06:18.028
What the fuck?

06:18.028 --> 06:18.861
- What?

06:18.861 --> 06:19.694
- Yo, yo, yo.

06:19.694 --> 06:21.040
That new school of his is
turning him into a pussy, man.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.743
- Oh, fuck you.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.603
No, no, dude, dude, dude.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.770
You should see this new
teacher that we got.

06:28.770 --> 06:30.239
- What the fuck?

06:30.239 --> 06:31.994
(laughing)

06:31.994 --> 06:32.827
- Like, no dude.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.230
Like she's all proper and shy and shit

06:35.230 --> 06:39.040
but those are the ones always
freak in the sheets, man.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.937
- Dog, you know shit
about freaks in the sheet.

06:41.937 --> 06:42.770
- What?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.160
I know a lot more than you, fag.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.557
- Fuck no.
- Like Sarah Kadinkski, huh?

06:45.557 --> 06:47.317
- The fuck, bitch ass hoe.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.653
- Fuck you.

06:49.653 --> 06:50.703
I never--

06:50.703 --> 06:51.536
- Yeah you did!

06:51.536 --> 06:52.369
- Yeah you did!

06:52.369 --> 06:53.202
(laughing)

06:56.840 --> 06:59.180
- Yeah they seem like good
kids for the most part

06:59.180 --> 07:00.800
and the school's really nice.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.090
I certainly won't miss
Braybrook, that's for sure.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.840
- Well you never complained
about Braybrook before.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.060
Look, I know you're getting a fresh start

07:08.060 --> 07:10.100
but don't forget where you came from.

07:10.100 --> 07:10.933
- No, I know.

07:10.933 --> 07:13.580
And it's not Braybrook that
I needed to get away from

07:13.580 --> 07:16.951
but Westbury's a definite improvement.

07:16.951 --> 07:20.260
You know, I wish Dale could've
gone to a school like this.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.120
- Don't worry about your brother.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.118
He can take care of himself.

07:24.118 --> 07:24.951
- Hi sis.

07:24.951 --> 07:26.940
- Tell him hi back.

07:26.940 --> 07:27.940
Oh, I miss you guys.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.417
(dissonant music)

07:42.180 --> 07:43.200
- [Shelly] Nothing's gonna change

07:43.200 --> 07:45.710
if you keep hanging
around those same people.

07:45.710 --> 07:47.023
- They're my friends, Mom.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.047
- Can't you make friends
at your new school?

07:49.047 --> 07:51.719
- Can you just relax?

07:51.719 --> 07:53.660
Look, I wasn't even doing anything wrong.

07:53.660 --> 07:54.690
- Relax?

07:54.690 --> 07:56.900
I've already lost one son.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.330
- What are you two
screeching about this time?

07:59.330 --> 08:00.163
- Nothing, Dad.

08:00.163 --> 08:01.193
Just go back to sleep.

08:02.870 --> 08:04.600
I'm not Michael.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.800
Stop putting that on me.

08:13.100 --> 08:13.933
(bell ringing)

08:13.933 --> 08:18.933
- I still need that
note from your parents.

08:27.620 --> 08:28.453
Okay.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.290
Well if they've signed off on it.

08:31.290 --> 08:33.470
All right, thank you for that, Cindy.

08:35.350 --> 08:36.933
Jason, what can I do for you?

08:38.582 --> 08:39.416
- I think I need some help

08:39.416 --> 08:41.082
with my personal essay assignment.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.832
- Okay.

08:42.832 --> 08:44.310
Well have you picked a topic yet?

08:45.802 --> 08:48.033
- Well, I mean, it's a personal essay.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.492
So the obvious thing to write about

08:49.492 --> 08:52.470
is my family or myself, right?

08:52.470 --> 08:53.303
- Right.

08:53.303 --> 08:55.300
Yeah, I expect that's what
most people will write about

08:55.300 --> 08:57.080
or an experience that they've had.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.370
A lot of people use them as practice

08:58.370 --> 09:00.270
for their college application letters.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.760
Look, the purpose of the essay

09:04.760 --> 09:07.170
is just to practice structured writing.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.960
But it also helps me to learn more

09:08.960 --> 09:09.860
about each of you.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.300
If you're worried about
who's gonna see them,

09:13.300 --> 09:14.853
I guarantee that it's just me.

09:16.910 --> 09:18.790
- Well, what about you?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.934
- What do you mean? What about me?

09:20.934 --> 09:22.270
- I mean, you wanna know all about me?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.547
I don't even know who you are.

09:23.547 --> 09:25.543
I mean, what do I know about you?

09:26.768 --> 09:28.904
- Well, what do you wanna know?

09:28.904 --> 09:31.444
(gentle music)

09:31.444 --> 09:32.444
- Forget it.

09:37.130 --> 09:38.073
- Slow down.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.140
Little shit.

09:40.140 --> 09:40.973
- Sorry about that.

09:40.973 --> 09:42.930
- It's not your fault.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.450
But hey, don't waste
your time with that one.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.130
He's a bad seed.

09:47.130 --> 09:48.430
- How do you mean?

09:48.430 --> 09:50.000
- I mean he doesn't give a shit.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.810
Couldn't care less about school.

09:51.810 --> 09:53.417
He'll be dead by the time he's 20.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.640
- Oh, that's a bit
extreme, don't you think?

09:55.640 --> 09:56.473
- Trust me.

09:56.473 --> 09:58.170
The kids from Malburg never last.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.313
They don't have it in them.

09:59.313 --> 10:00.643
They don't wanna learn.

10:01.740 --> 10:02.730
- No, you're wrong.

10:02.730 --> 10:05.500
He was just here asking
for help with homework.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.446
He does care.

10:06.446 --> 10:09.393
- (laughs) Fine, waste your time.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.050
- I don't think of it as wasting my time.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.010
I'm a teacher.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.290
I think of it as doing my job.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.353
- Good luck with that.

10:54.490 --> 10:57.760
- This toxicity I must destroy.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.470
The flames lick away the pain.

11:00.470 --> 11:03.550
Self-preservation is my ploy

11:03.550 --> 11:05.633
and my freedom I'll regain.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.093
- Thank you Nina.

11:08.093 --> 11:09.090
I enjoyed the imagery.

11:09.090 --> 11:09.923
- Thank you.

11:17.090 --> 11:17.923
- Jason.

11:17.923 --> 11:18.980
You're up.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.420
- Still don't see how writing poetry's

11:20.420 --> 11:22.520
ever gonna help me in the real world.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.353
- Yeah, come on.

11:24.390 --> 11:25.223
- Read.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.700
- What happens happens for a reason.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.773
Though those reasons remain unknown.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.330
It won't be this bad forever

11:53.330 --> 11:55.700
though you feel like you walk alone.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.530
I can hear somebody screaming.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.323
I can hear fear and agony.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.283
Frantic I open my eyes.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.343
I realize that somebody's me.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.080
You cannot change what happened

12:09.080 --> 12:11.270
no matter how hard you try.

12:11.270 --> 12:13.660
You cannot turn back the hands of time

12:13.660 --> 12:15.293
no matter how much you cry.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.530
The past is the past for a reason.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.570
That's where we should let it stay.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.550
Sometimes it's hard to let it go.

12:22.550 --> 12:24.263
Try not to let it eat you away.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.760
Dark times make you stronger

12:27.760 --> 12:29.673
though sometimes cold and withdrawn.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.913
When it feels too much,

12:33.960 --> 12:38.003
remember it's always
darkest before the dawn.

12:45.770 --> 12:46.603
That's it.

12:47.713 --> 12:49.296
- Thank you, Jason.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.065
- I can hear myself scream.

12:58.065 --> 12:58.983
(screams)

12:58.983 --> 12:59.816
(laughing)

12:59.816 --> 13:00.649
- That's enough, David.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.353
Come on, let's see what you've got.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.250
(students groaning)

13:10.150 --> 13:11.710
(bell rings)

13:11.710 --> 13:12.840
Oh, Jason.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.790
Can I see you before you leave, please?

13:15.980 --> 13:17.763
- What's up?

13:17.763 --> 13:19.583
- I was just looking over your file.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.593
Oh, it's okay.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.370
I'm just looking over everybody's files.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.110
I notice that you're new here too.

13:25.110 --> 13:26.753
Transferred last semester.

13:30.370 --> 13:31.773
What made you wanna transfer?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.300
- Do you know Malburg?

13:35.680 --> 13:39.120
- Not personally but I have heard of it.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.820
Were you having trouble
with the other kids there?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.210
- No, it was nothing like that.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.110
I was happy there.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.680
My parents just don't want
me to get into trouble.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.100
My mom's pretty religious
so she asked a priest

13:50.100 --> 13:51.000
to get me in here.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.504
- You said you were happy there.

13:56.504 --> 13:57.454
Are you happy here?

14:01.182 --> 14:02.682
- I don't like taking charity.

14:03.690 --> 14:04.640
- What do you mean?

14:06.750 --> 14:07.583
- Forget it.

14:07.583 --> 14:08.416
Can I just go?

14:08.416 --> 14:09.249
- Just a second.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.060
I wanted you to know how impressed I was

14:12.060 --> 14:13.800
with your poem today.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.050
I have to say, I was surprised
looking over your grades.

14:16.050 --> 14:16.990
I think you're more capable

14:16.990 --> 14:18.940
than you're giving yourself credit for.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.460
- Well you don't know me.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.170
- I know talent.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.010
I'm not letting you get away

14:25.010 --> 14:26.150
with the bare minimum anymore.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.270
Not now that I know what you can do.

14:28.270 --> 14:29.470
- Well it's just a poem.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.130
- Regardless, you set the standard.

14:33.130 --> 14:34.990
Now I expect you to live up to it.

14:34.990 --> 14:35.823
Okay?

14:37.490 --> 14:38.323
- Okay.

14:39.442 --> 14:40.780
Can I go?

14:40.780 --> 14:41.980
- Yeah, get out of here.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.733
(gentle music)

15:00.153 --> 15:02.153
(sighs)

15:29.340 --> 15:31.150
- [Jason] All right, gotta go.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.590
- Where are you going?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.018
- Study group at the library.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.883
- [Shelly] Oh.

15:35.883 --> 15:37.127
- What, that's it?

15:37.127 --> 15:38.546
Oh?

15:38.546 --> 15:40.320
I thought you'd be a little happier.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.660
- I am.

15:41.660 --> 15:43.860
I knew you'd do the right thing.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.853
Don't be too late.

15:46.910 --> 15:48.870
- Bitch, she's got me like
working for it out here.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.281
I mean, she's hot but she's--

15:50.281 --> 15:51.700
- She has everybody working for it.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.510
- She thinks that she's the
shit and everything but it's--

15:53.510 --> 15:55.381
- Hey, look who it is.

15:55.381 --> 15:57.030
- Oh shit.

15:57.030 --> 15:58.970
How kind of you to grace
us with your presence.

15:58.970 --> 16:00.780
- Oh yeah, shut the fuck up.

16:00.780 --> 16:01.613
- Yeah, we're not keeping you

16:01.613 --> 16:03.070
from all your preppy new friends, are we?

16:03.070 --> 16:04.106
- I'm here aren't I?

16:04.106 --> 16:05.660
- Yeah, I guess.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.833
- Thank you, asshole.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.360
- So where you been?

16:12.360 --> 16:15.057
- I'm just fucking trying to
lay low right now with my mom.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.820
Like she's been riding me with this shit

16:16.820 --> 16:17.980
that happened to Michael.
- Shit.

16:17.980 --> 16:19.720
- Dude, that shit happens like everyday.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.140
I don't get why she's so upset.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.251
- You know how she is.

16:22.251 --> 16:23.257
- Dude, we're lucky she hasn't sent you

16:23.257 --> 16:25.174
off to military school.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.555
- Oh shit, I got a pic.

16:27.555 --> 16:28.388
- Oh shit, man.
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.408
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:29.408 --> 16:30.967
Hold on, let me look
first, let me look first.

16:30.967 --> 16:31.800
Damn, she's fine.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.939
- What, that bitch is ugly, bro.

16:32.939 --> 16:35.243
I'm telling you, no dude, she's fine.

16:35.243 --> 16:36.076
- Ugh.

16:36.076 --> 16:36.909
- I'm 'bout it.

16:36.909 --> 16:37.742
- You have really low standards.

16:37.742 --> 16:38.575
- Oh my God.
(Jason laughing)

16:38.575 --> 16:40.263
This is my life, this is my life.

16:40.263 --> 16:41.440
This is my life right now.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.506
- You nasty asshole.

16:42.506 --> 16:43.823
- You gonna break me down like that?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.705
- Here you go sweetie.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.538
- [John] Good morning.

16:50.450 --> 16:52.250
- Jason, you're gonna be late again.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.099
- No, I'm not.

16:54.099 --> 16:56.682
(gentle music)

17:07.180 --> 17:08.109
- Hey.
- Oh hey.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.050
- We still on for tonight?

17:09.050 --> 17:09.950
- Tonight?

17:09.950 --> 17:12.180
Oh, the hot spots, right.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.190
- Come on, it'll be fun.

17:14.190 --> 17:15.022
- Yeah.

17:15.022 --> 17:15.856
Sure, why not?

17:15.856 --> 17:16.689
- Perfect.
- Okay.

17:20.441 --> 17:23.550
(bell rings)

17:23.550 --> 17:25.800
I noticed you were
distracted today in class.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.655
- Just under a lot of pressure right now.

17:29.655 --> 17:32.460
My stupid parents are on
my back about my grades.

17:32.460 --> 17:33.910
- Well you know the personal essay

17:33.910 --> 17:36.238
doesn't go towards your overall grade.

17:36.238 --> 17:38.413
- That's not my issue
with the essay though.

17:39.820 --> 17:40.653
- Well what is?

17:44.190 --> 17:45.343
- I'm not from here.

17:47.390 --> 17:48.493
- So, neither am I.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.543
- But you don't get it.

17:53.990 --> 17:54.850
We don't have any money.

17:54.850 --> 17:57.590
So my essay, it's not gonna be all rosy

17:57.590 --> 17:58.853
like everyone else's.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.163
- Jason, you don't have to
worry about that with me.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.450
I'm from Braybrook.

18:08.385 --> 18:09.285
- Wait, for real?

18:10.520 --> 18:11.784
- For real.

18:11.784 --> 18:12.980
(Jason laughs)

18:12.980 --> 18:14.760
- Well, how'd you end up here?

18:14.760 --> 18:15.593
You religious?

18:19.520 --> 18:20.490
- No.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.267
(laughs)

18:22.267 --> 18:23.367
I'm not even Catholic.

18:24.365 --> 18:25.198
Shh.

18:25.198 --> 18:27.448
(laughing)

18:28.970 --> 18:32.380
Look, how about I spend
30 minutes with you

18:32.380 --> 18:33.380
after class each day

18:33.380 --> 18:36.870
and we just work on whatever
it is you need help with.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.500
- You don't have to.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.600
- I know I don't have to.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.433
I want to.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.730
I told you I'm not letting you get by

18:42.730 --> 18:44.230
with the bare minimum anymore.

18:45.543 --> 18:46.640
Your parents want you out of Malburg.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.390
Well, getting your grades up

18:48.390 --> 18:51.356
and going to college is
gonna be your ticket.

18:51.356 --> 18:54.260
- Well we both know I'm never
gonna make it to college.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.413
So you can just stop playing that line.

18:55.413 --> 18:57.540
- It's not a line.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.617
There's no reason you can't
do whatever you want to.

18:59.617 --> 19:03.163
You just need pointing
in the right direction.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.030
So what do you say?

19:09.629 --> 19:10.462
- Okay.

19:12.812 --> 19:14.213
Thanks Mrs Kendy.

19:14.213 --> 19:15.046
- Ms.

19:19.170 --> 19:23.120
- I did the personal essay
if you still want that.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.063
- Yeah, of course.

19:27.421 --> 19:28.254
You know Jason, I want you to know

19:28.254 --> 19:30.323
that you can talk to me if you need to.

19:31.410 --> 19:32.243
Okay?

19:41.582 --> 19:43.832
(laughing)

19:45.366 --> 19:46.541

- So what is your situation?

20:07.220 --> 20:08.560
- My situation?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.607
- Well yeah, I don't,

20:10.607 --> 20:12.240
yep, I don't see a ring on your finger.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.583

I would give you my coat but--

21:37.320 --> 21:38.153
- Oh.

21:38.153 --> 21:38.986
- I am not wearing one.

21:38.986 --> 21:39.819
- It's fine, I'll live.

21:39.819 --> 21:40.652
- Okay.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.650
Well, there you go.

21:46.580 --> 21:48.093
Your chariot awaits.

21:50.420 --> 21:51.253
- Thank you.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.863
- Oh, hugs.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.080
- [Lila] Goodnight.

21:59.080 --> 21:59.913
- Night.

22:02.430 --> 22:03.263
Had fun.

22:03.263 --> 22:04.270
We should do it again sometime.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.450
Okay.

22:13.450 --> 22:14.283
Maybe next time.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.433
Yeah.

22:16.433 --> 22:17.266
That'd be fun.

22:17.266 --> 22:18.099
Just give me a call.

22:18.099 --> 22:19.180
Yeah, I'll see you at school.

22:20.358 --> 22:21.191
Bye.

22:24.116 --> 22:26.533
(Lila sighs)

22:41.982 --> 22:44.482
(Lila scoffs)

22:50.756 --> 22:52.006
Hey.

22:52.006 --> 22:53.750
- [Lila] Oh, hey.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.956
- I wasn't sure you'd make it in today.

22:54.956 --> 22:57.090
- Oh God, I'm so embarrassed.

22:57.090 --> 22:59.620
I hope I wasn't too much of
an annoying drunk last night.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.740
- No, no, you looked like
you were having a good time.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.570
- Yeah, I was.

23:03.570 --> 23:04.980
- [Andrew] Glad to hear it.

23:04.980 --> 23:05.813
- I guess I just haven't

23:05.813 --> 23:07.250
drunk alcohol in such a long time

23:07.250 --> 23:09.190
that I've lost my tolerance for it.

23:09.190 --> 23:10.400
- I guess we will just have to work on

23:10.400 --> 23:11.580
building it back up again.

23:11.580 --> 23:12.413
- Oh god.

23:12.413 --> 23:14.950
Drinking again is the last
thing I can think about.

23:14.950 --> 23:16.490
- [Andrew] How are you feeling?

23:16.490 --> 23:17.880
- Probably better than I deserve.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.560
- Oh, come on.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.560
Don't be so hard on yourself.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.393
You're gonna make me feel bad.

23:22.393 --> 23:24.030
I feel like I'm responsible.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.060
- Don't be silly.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.120
I'm a big girl.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.710
- Yeah, you keep telling me
you're tougher than you look.

23:28.710 --> 23:30.110
We will see.

23:30.110 --> 23:30.943
- Mm-hmm.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.776
(bell rings)

23:31.776 --> 23:32.609
Oh.

23:33.570 --> 23:36.340
- I'm not sure who dreads that bell more,

23:36.340 --> 23:37.426
them or us.

23:37.426 --> 23:39.926
(Lila laughs)

24:00.514 --> 24:02.931
(bell rings)

24:18.560 --> 24:19.580
- Did you think I wouldn't notice

24:19.580 --> 24:21.180
that you weren't in class today?

24:22.308 --> 24:23.458
- Why, did you miss me?

24:25.720 --> 24:28.020
- Look Jason, if you aren't
gonna show up to my class,

24:28.020 --> 24:30.240
then you clearly don't really wanna learn.

24:30.240 --> 24:33.391
So why should I waste my
private time tutoring you?

24:33.391 --> 24:35.160
- No, you're right.

24:35.160 --> 24:35.993
I can see how it looked that way

24:35.993 --> 24:38.480
but I just didn't wanna be distracted

24:38.480 --> 24:39.810
by the other students in class

24:39.810 --> 24:42.243
so I was working in the library.

24:44.740 --> 24:47.113
- Jason, I saw you sneaking out at lunch.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.273
And lying to me really doesn't
make me wanna help you.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.810
- You're right.

24:54.810 --> 24:55.643
I'm sorry.

24:58.420 --> 24:59.253
I'll go.

25:00.470 --> 25:02.870
I guess I'm just destined to fail,

25:02.870 --> 25:04.890
end up a gang banger in the streets

25:04.890 --> 25:07.040
running guns, girls, and crack.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.120
- Oh, sit down.

25:09.513 --> 25:12.096
(Jason laughs)

25:15.483 --> 25:16.950
- So I was thinking we could start off

25:16.950 --> 25:18.390
with my history homework.

25:18.390 --> 25:20.090
- All right, show me what you got.

25:28.257 --> 25:29.870
(Lila sighs)

25:29.870 --> 25:30.703
- Hangover?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.633
- Excuse me?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.400
- I saw you last night at the bar.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.960
- Well what were you doing there

25:38.960 --> 25:40.113
if you're underage?

25:41.840 --> 25:43.340
- The guy who runs it owes me.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.170
- Okay, let's do some work.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.010
That's what we're here for.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.300
- No.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.933
Aren't you gonna give
me some dancing lessons?

25:51.933 --> 25:53.430
- Okay, I think we're done here.

25:53.430 --> 25:54.940
- Oh, come on, no, relax.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.173
I'm just teasing.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.070
How often do you think I get to see

25:58.070 --> 25:59.720
a teacher in her natural habitat?

26:02.980 --> 26:03.813
Okay, I'm sorry.

26:03.813 --> 26:04.863
I couldn't resist.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.823
- [Lila] Come on, let's do some work.

26:12.383 --> 26:15.183
- Wait, so you're not gonna
report me for ditching?

26:16.670 --> 26:17.503
- Well how would that benefit anyone?

26:18.500 --> 26:20.860
Plus I trust that you're not
gonna do it again, right?

26:20.860 --> 26:22.150
- Right.

26:22.150 --> 26:23.060
- Okay.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.173
Women in history.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.613
It was good though.

26:30.613 --> 26:33.130
I mean, I had a little
bit too much to drink

26:33.130 --> 26:34.760
but I did have fun.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.660
- Did you kiss?

26:35.660 --> 26:38.540
- No, I just told you we're colleagues.

26:38.540 --> 26:39.900
- Will you see him again?

26:39.900 --> 26:41.540
- I see him everyday at school.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.287
You're making this into
something that it isn't.

26:43.287 --> 26:45.770
- I'm just excited for you!

26:45.770 --> 26:48.596
I wanna see you happy and settled.

26:48.596 --> 26:49.429
You know, I'd eventually like

26:49.429 --> 26:50.960
to get some grandkids, you know.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.220
- Oh, here we go.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.200
Look, I think I deserve

26:53.200 --> 26:54.300
a little bit of time to myself

26:54.300 --> 26:56.760
before I jump back into baby mode, okay?

26:56.760 --> 26:57.940
- [Mary] All right.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.922
All right.

26:58.922 --> 26:59.755
(knocking on door)

26:59.755 --> 27:00.833
- Mom, hold on a sec.

27:06.010 --> 27:06.940
Mom, I'm gonna go.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.090
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:09.100 --> 27:09.933
Jason.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.150
What happened?

27:12.150 --> 27:12.983
What are you doing here?

27:12.983 --> 27:14.113
- I'm sorry.

27:14.972 --> 27:16.130
I wouldn't have come here.

27:16.130 --> 27:16.963
I just don't have anywhere else to go.

27:16.963 --> 27:18.630
- No, it's okay.

27:18.630 --> 27:19.463
Does it hurt?

27:20.451 --> 27:21.451
- What do you think?

27:22.343 --> 27:24.593
- Do you think it's broken?

27:25.653 --> 27:27.053
- I don't think so.

27:28.224 --> 27:30.621
Look, I just wanted to get cleaned up

27:30.621 --> 27:32.329
before I go home.

27:32.329 --> 27:33.844
I can't let my parents see me like this.

27:33.844 --> 27:35.147
- Of course.

27:35.147 --> 27:37.023
Just let me get a towel.

27:46.757 --> 27:48.470
(Lila sighs)

27:48.470 --> 27:50.320
Well, do you want me to
take you to the station

27:50.320 --> 27:52.070
to make a report?

27:52.070 --> 27:53.263
- Absolutely not.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.800
- Can you tell me what happened?

28:03.350 --> 28:04.183
- It's nothing.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.443
Just an occupational hazard.

28:09.580 --> 28:10.953
- What occupation is that?

28:12.840 --> 28:14.290
- You ask a lot of questions.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.400
- You don't answer many.

28:22.020 --> 28:22.950
Okay Jason, look,

28:22.950 --> 28:24.260
if you're gonna show up to my place

28:24.260 --> 28:25.093
in the middle of the night,

28:25.093 --> 28:26.550
I think that means that you trust me,

28:26.550 --> 28:27.460
and you can,

28:27.460 --> 28:28.870
but you can't expect
that I'm not gonna want

28:28.870 --> 28:30.800
some kind of explanation in return.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.323
- I wasn't asking for help.

28:32.323 --> 28:34.190
I just wanted to wash up.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.043
I've done that, thank you.

28:35.043 --> 28:36.533
I won't come here again.

28:38.910 --> 28:39.743
- Stop.

28:43.070 --> 28:44.560
Where are you going?

28:44.560 --> 28:45.940
- Home.

28:45.940 --> 28:47.890
Before my mom sends out a search party.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.653
- Let me drive you.

28:54.693 --> 28:55.526
- Fine.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.743
- Do you have any siblings?

29:16.380 --> 29:17.213
- Yeah.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.293
- How many?

29:23.685 --> 29:24.852
- [Jason] Two.

29:27.220 --> 29:29.183
- [Lila] Don't drown me in details.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.113
- [Jason] Hmm?

29:33.690 --> 29:35.090
- I'm trying to talk to you.

29:37.810 --> 29:38.643
- Sorry.

29:41.491 --> 29:43.658
Just got a lot on my mind.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.233
Hey, turn down there.

30:06.818 --> 30:07.651
- Why?

30:07.651 --> 30:08.799
- [Jason] Just trust me, turn, turn.

30:08.799 --> 30:09.632
- Okay.

30:21.957 --> 30:23.880
What are we doing here?

30:23.880 --> 30:24.713
- Come on.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.848

30:28.681 --> 30:29.514

I think you're a great kid

32:18.180 --> 32:19.523
but I'm your teacher.

32:21.510 --> 32:23.390

- Your grades.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.679
I am so proud of you.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.100
Huge improvement.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.639
- Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.760
- Are you joking?

34:16.760 --> 34:18.592
This is the best you've ever done.

34:19.570 --> 34:21.563
Guess the school's finally paying off.

34:22.853 --> 34:23.880
- Yeah.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.400
I can't really take all the credit.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.083
Ms. Kendy, she's really
been helping me out.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.280

34:32.112 --> 34:35.217
She offered to tutor me
after every class a bit.

34:35.217 --> 34:36.210
- That's really nice of her.

34:36.210 --> 34:37.850
She must like you to do that.

34:38.895 --> 34:39.860

35:24.082 --> 35:27.170

before when we were here,

35:27.170 --> 35:28.470
that you pawned your ring.

35:51.470 --> 35:56.470

37:47.390 --> 37:48.330
Go ahead.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.163
I got this.

37:49.163 --> 37:51.120
- Thank you so much.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.870
- Let me know if you need anything.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.033
Or not.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.483
- Andrew, hi.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.782
Can I join you?

38:01.782 --> 38:02.615
- Hi Shannen.

38:03.590 --> 38:04.853
Yeah, sure.

38:06.194 --> 38:09.140
- I swear that kid follows
her around like a puppy dog.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.597
- [Andrew] Yeah.

38:14.597 --> 38:15.514
I guess so.

38:25.228 --> 38:28.145
(knocking on door)

38:29.037 --> 38:30.037
- Who is it?

38:30.920 --> 38:31.753
- It's Jason.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.410
Are you gonna open the door?

38:40.320 --> 38:42.070
- I don't think that's a good idea.

38:45.130 --> 38:47.238
- [Jason] I just wanna talk.

38:47.238 --> 38:49.155
I'm sorry about before.

39:00.273 --> 39:01.860
- Look, I accept your apology

39:01.860 --> 39:03.193
but this has got to stop.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.500
- Can I just come in for a minute?

39:06.500 --> 39:07.333
- What for?

39:08.461 --> 39:09.608
- You really think this is a conversation

39:09.608 --> 39:11.308
we should be having in the street?

39:18.850 --> 39:20.050
- Look Jason, I should've been

39:20.050 --> 39:21.430
clear about this the first time.

39:21.430 --> 39:22.590
You can't be here.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.350
It's inappropriate for
a teacher and a student

39:24.350 --> 39:25.939
to be alone together outside of school.

39:25.939 --> 39:27.784
- I know, I know.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.240
I just wanted to see you.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.073
- No.

39:31.215 --> 39:33.519
- Do you think I'm gonna hurt you?

39:33.519 --> 39:34.352
- No.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.120
I just think

39:37.120 --> 39:39.327
we need to keep our distance, okay?

39:42.951 --> 39:44.701
- You kissed me back.

39:46.163 --> 39:50.230
Why?

39:50.230 --> 39:51.070
- Why what?

39:52.870 --> 39:54.163
- Why'd you kiss me back?

39:56.750 --> 39:58.110
- I shouldn't have.

39:58.110 --> 39:58.943
I'm sorry.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.233
- That's not an answer.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.833
- I don't know.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.490
I don't have an answer.

40:06.490 --> 40:07.413
I wasn't thinking.

40:09.100 --> 40:09.933
- Bullshit.

40:09.933 --> 40:11.170
- [Lila] It's not bullshit.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.740
- We have chemistry and you know it.

40:18.187 --> 40:20.090
Can I kiss you again?

40:20.090 --> 40:20.923
- No.

40:21.840 --> 40:22.673
- Please?

40:25.472 --> 40:26.894
- This isn't right.

40:26.894 --> 40:27.894
- Who cares?

40:28.857 --> 40:29.690
- I care.

40:36.982 --> 40:37.815
- Do you?

40:42.586 --> 40:43.419
- I can't.

40:45.212 --> 40:48.295
(instrumental music)

41:34.135 --> 41:35.468
- Stop thinking.

41:54.817 --> 41:57.484
(Lila laughing)

42:37.080 --> 42:38.263
- Fuck, this is bad.

42:40.660 --> 42:41.493
- Okay.

42:42.690 --> 42:43.523
- Not you.

42:43.523 --> 42:45.803
Just this should never have happened.

42:47.624 --> 42:48.590
- Well it did.

42:48.590 --> 42:50.363
So just relax and enjoy it for now.

43:01.890 --> 43:03.810
- Nobody can know about this, okay?

43:04.996 --> 43:06.283
Promise me.

43:06.283 --> 43:07.116
- I promise.

43:12.550 --> 43:14.123
- And it can't happen again.

43:19.490 --> 43:21.643
It's not gonna happen again, all right?

43:22.483 --> 43:25.066
(Jason laughs)

43:26.700 --> 43:29.040
- Hypothetically speaking,

43:29.040 --> 43:30.050
if I agree to that,

43:30.050 --> 43:32.040
will you agree to just relax

43:32.040 --> 43:34.140
and enjoy the rest of the morning with me?

43:38.303 --> 43:41.077
I promise no one's gonna find out.

43:41.077 --> 43:41.910
Trust me.

43:43.111 --> 43:43.944
Trust me.

43:48.920 --> 43:49.753
- Okay.

44:02.905 --> 44:04.067
- Oh god.

44:04.067 --> 44:06.837
- But aren't your parents
gonna wonder where you are?

44:06.837 --> 44:08.563
- No, I texted my mom last night.

44:10.212 --> 44:11.463
- What did you tell her?

44:12.621 --> 44:15.494
- I told her I was
inside of you all night.

44:15.494 --> 44:16.613
- Ow, I'm kidding.

44:16.613 --> 44:17.640
(laughing)

44:17.640 --> 44:19.057
- It's not funny.

44:20.730 --> 44:22.140
- I just texted her saying

44:22.140 --> 44:23.573
I was playing video games at Nick's

44:23.573 --> 44:25.406
and was staying there.

44:29.277 --> 44:30.110
(Lila yelps)

44:30.110 --> 44:30.943
- Oh god

44:32.029 --> 44:34.279
(laughing)

44:43.111 --> 44:45.278
What are you staring at?

44:46.390 --> 44:47.223
- You.

44:48.084 --> 44:50.584
(Lila laughs)

44:57.510 --> 44:58.910
- Tell me about your family.

45:00.710 --> 45:03.082
- What do you wanna know?

45:04.140 --> 45:06.763
- Well you never told
me about your siblings.

45:08.454 --> 45:11.023
- I have an older brother
and a younger sister.

45:12.230 --> 45:13.733
Classic middle child syndrome.

45:16.180 --> 45:17.463
- Are you close with them?

45:19.330 --> 45:21.680
- I was close with my older brother.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.090
I'm very close with my sister.

45:23.090 --> 45:24.073
She's my baby.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.850
- You said was.

45:29.023 --> 45:30.763
Did your brother pass away?

45:32.140 --> 45:32.973
- No.

45:37.090 --> 45:37.923
He's in jail.

45:40.780 --> 45:41.613
- Oh, I'm sorry.

45:44.160 --> 45:44.993
What did he do?

45:46.811 --> 45:48.311
- A lot of things.

45:50.017 --> 45:50.850
But he's not a bad guy.

45:50.850 --> 45:53.247
He was just trying to take care of us.

45:54.470 --> 45:56.470
- I'm sure that's rough on your parents.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.059
- Yeah, it nearly killed my mother.

46:00.059 --> 46:01.659
Now they just take it out on me.

46:03.186 --> 46:04.019
- How?

46:06.258 --> 46:07.091
- They're just so paranoid

46:07.091 --> 46:08.460
I'm gonna make the same mistakes.

46:08.460 --> 46:10.410
Like that's why they're so worried

46:10.410 --> 46:11.560
about me getting good grades.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.393
They're desperate for me

46:12.393 --> 46:14.030
to get out of the shitty neighborhood

46:14.030 --> 46:15.590
and just go to college and--

46:15.590 --> 46:17.570
- Well you can't hold that against them.

46:17.570 --> 46:18.810
They just want what's best for you.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.750
- I know, but it's just exhausting.

46:21.750 --> 46:23.520
I constantly have to make up excuses

46:23.520 --> 46:26.350
for where I am every second of the day.

46:26.350 --> 46:28.950
- Well where are you going
that you can't tell them?

46:30.130 --> 46:31.452
- Don't you start.

46:31.452 --> 46:33.952
(Lila laughs)

46:43.760 --> 46:45.350
- We have to get up.

46:45.350 --> 46:46.470
- No.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.710
- Mm-hmm.

46:47.710 --> 46:50.377
(both groaning)

46:57.280 --> 46:59.163
- Hey, listen.

47:00.640 --> 47:02.490
I'm not gonna make it to class today.

47:05.911 --> 47:07.440
Is that okay, Ms Kendy?

47:07.440 --> 47:08.673
- How come?

47:08.673 --> 47:11.440
- I have to take my dad to
his doctor's appointment.

47:11.440 --> 47:12.693
- Uh-huh.
- I'm serious.

47:12.693 --> 47:14.026
- [Lila] Mm-hmm.

47:15.070 --> 47:16.100
- I'll definitely make it back

47:16.100 --> 47:18.391
for our tutoring session though.

47:18.391 --> 47:19.630
Okay?

47:19.630 --> 47:20.948
- Okay.

47:20.948 --> 47:21.781
Okay.

47:42.390 --> 47:43.440
- Saw you last night.

47:45.330 --> 47:46.193
With Andrew.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.053
- Oh.

47:52.410 --> 47:54.593
- We had a great time after you left.

47:55.850 --> 47:56.683
- That's nice.

47:57.580 --> 47:58.950
- Oh, well you probably didn't know

47:58.950 --> 48:00.500
that Andrew and I used to date.

48:02.250 --> 48:03.470
- No, I didn't.

48:03.470 --> 48:04.303
What about it?

48:05.550 --> 48:07.570
- I just hope it doesn't
make you feel insecure

48:07.570 --> 48:08.433
working with me.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.520
- Shannen, Andrew and I are just friends

48:11.520 --> 48:13.183
if that's what you're worried about.

48:14.700 --> 48:16.010
- I'm not worried.

48:16.010 --> 48:17.460
Just thought you should know.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.723

- I wanted to check if your mom was okay.

49:15.450 --> 49:16.340
- My mom?

49:16.340 --> 49:17.350
Oh, right.

49:17.350 --> 49:20.023
Sorry, I'm just a little
bit out of it today.

49:22.270 --> 49:23.150
- So?

49:23.150 --> 49:24.770
- Oh!

49:24.770 --> 49:27.030
No, yes, she's fine.

49:27.030 --> 49:29.470
Turns out she was just making
a big deal out of nothing.

49:29.470 --> 49:30.689
- Oh.

49:30.689 --> 49:32.200
Well, it was too bad
our date got cut short.

49:32.200 --> 49:35.113
We should pick it up again
sometime this weekend.

49:36.230 --> 49:37.063
Oh.

49:38.830 --> 49:39.880
- I'm ready Ms Kendy.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.403
- Andrew, I will talk to you tomorrow.

49:45.360 --> 49:46.193
Okay?
- Okay.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.710
Bye.

49:48.710 --> 49:49.543
Walker.

49:54.470 --> 49:55.960
- Well you look very happy.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.110
I take it your dad's
appointment went well.

49:59.241 --> 50:00.310
- I'm just happy to see you.

50:00.310 --> 50:01.870
- Jason.

50:01.870 --> 50:04.100
We need to pretend like
last night didn't happen.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.053
You agreed to that.

50:06.026 --> 50:08.680
- Can I at least give you your gift first?

50:08.680 --> 50:09.980
- Look, this needs to be

50:09.980 --> 50:11.730
purely a student teacher relationship.

50:11.730 --> 50:13.580
Otherwise, I can't tutor you anymore.

50:15.110 --> 50:15.943
- Okay, fine.

50:18.040 --> 50:18.873
- Okay, good.

50:20.490 --> 50:21.730
What are we working on today?

50:21.730 --> 50:22.847
- I just need to give
you your present first

50:22.847 --> 50:25.363
and then we can go back to normal.

50:27.710 --> 50:28.543
Close your eyes.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.313
- Jason.

50:30.313 --> 50:31.146
- Just close them.

50:31.146 --> 50:31.979
Nobody's watching.

50:36.039 --> 50:38.706
(Jason giggles)

50:46.368 --> 50:48.951
(gentle music)

51:01.831 --> 51:02.845
All right.

51:02.845 --> 51:03.678
Open.

51:07.952 --> 51:09.223
(Lila giggles)

51:09.223 --> 51:10.818
- Thank you.

51:10.818 --> 51:12.068
It's beautiful.

51:19.943 --> 51:23.653
Look Jason, I like you more than I should,

51:25.580 --> 51:28.028
but I could lose my job over this.

51:28.028 --> 51:28.907
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

51:28.907 --> 51:30.080
- That's not the point.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.080
You're my student and you're underage.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.441
It's wrong.

51:33.441 --> 51:35.520
- [Jason] You didn't think
it was wrong last night.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.770
- Yes I did, I told you that.

51:36.770 --> 51:38.037
- But you did it anyway.

51:41.830 --> 51:43.880
Let's just spend one more night together.

51:46.330 --> 51:47.163
- No.

51:48.710 --> 51:49.810
- Just to say goodbye.

51:51.110 --> 51:52.973
- I don't think that's a good idea.

51:55.497 --> 51:56.330
- All right.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.160
Let's just focus on homework now

52:00.180 --> 52:01.930
and then we'll discuss it Saturday.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.820
- There's nothing to discuss.

52:04.820 --> 52:05.820
- I'm not giving up.

52:13.589 --> 52:14.839
- Fine.
- Fine.

52:20.390 --> 52:21.223
Geography.

52:22.844 --> 52:23.930
- Give me that.

52:29.100 --> 52:30.630
Hi Mom, how's Dad?

52:30.630 --> 52:32.280
- Oh, still a miserable prick

52:32.280 --> 52:33.280
but he loves you.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.340
(giggles)

52:35.340 --> 52:37.780
So, tell me about Mr Lover Boy.

52:37.780 --> 52:39.110
- Oh god, you're ridiculous.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.850
We're just friends.

52:40.850 --> 52:42.700
We agreed to keep it professional.

52:42.700 --> 52:43.603
- [Mary] What, why?

52:44.710 --> 52:49.000
- Well, actually I kinda met someone else.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.343
- What, who?

52:53.470 --> 52:54.350
- Look, never mind.

52:54.350 --> 52:56.230
I don't even know why I brought it up.

52:56.230 --> 52:57.193
He's younger.

52:58.250 --> 52:59.603
It's not going anywhere.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.580
Just, it felt nice.

53:03.580 --> 53:04.783
Forget I said anything.

53:05.770 --> 53:07.233
- Well, do you like him?

53:09.780 --> 53:11.490
- Yeah, I do.

53:11.490 --> 53:12.710
- That's all that matters then.

53:12.710 --> 53:15.620
I wouldn't write it off just yet.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.060
- Maybe.

53:17.060 --> 53:19.130
- But I wouldn't be doing
my job as your mother

53:19.130 --> 53:22.700
if I didn't say I still think
you should consider Andrew.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.460
He's got a reliable job.

53:24.460 --> 53:27.010
P.E. teacher so he's probably
in pretty good shape.

53:27.900 --> 53:30.963
Oh, you need to be with someone reliable.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.550
Don't make the same mistake I did

53:33.550 --> 53:36.560
and get stuck with
someone like your father.

53:36.560 --> 53:39.100
You already have one
mistake under your belt.

53:39.100 --> 53:40.950
- Okay, thanks for the pep talk, Mom.

53:43.093 --> 53:44.600
I don't know how I let
you talk me into this.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.530
This was not the deal.

53:45.530 --> 53:47.450
- [Jason] It'll be fun, trust me.

53:47.450 --> 53:48.310
- [Lila] Would you stay down?

53:48.310 --> 53:49.983
- [Jason] Well, you could've just asked.

53:49.983 --> 53:50.816
- Stop!

53:50.816 --> 53:52.583
(laughing)

53:52.583 --> 53:54.943
All right, now where am I going?

53:56.740 --> 53:57.910
- Just get across the town border

53:57.910 --> 53:59.413
and then I'll direct.

53:59.413 --> 54:02.581
- All right.

54:45.530 --> 54:46.690
But I'm sure that we didn't have to come

54:46.690 --> 54:48.480
all the way out here to
have this conversation.

54:48.480 --> 54:51.110
- Would it kill you just
to live in the moment,

54:51.110 --> 54:52.860
not worry about every little thing?

54:56.617 --> 54:58.234
Come on.

55:05.452 --> 55:06.676
No, come on.

55:06.676 --> 55:09.176
(Lila laughs)

55:15.220 --> 55:16.850
See?

55:16.850 --> 55:18.193
Isn't it nice?

55:20.410 --> 55:21.850
- Yeah, I suppose so.

55:28.988 --> 55:30.630
- What?
- Hey.

55:30.630 --> 55:32.547
- What, you camera shy?

55:33.415 --> 55:34.498
Come on, one.

55:35.814 --> 55:37.251
- All right, one.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.084
One.

55:41.297 --> 55:44.130
(camera snapping)

55:47.468 --> 55:50.084
- I'll send these to you.

55:50.084 --> 55:50.917
Wait.

55:53.532 --> 55:56.910
Is this why you got kicked
out of your last school?

55:56.910 --> 55:59.200
- No, I didn't get kicked out.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.583
- Why then?

56:00.583 --> 56:04.323
- I just needed a clean slate.

56:06.870 --> 56:08.020
- Well usually people say that

56:08.020 --> 56:09.820
when they've made some huge mistake.

56:14.080 --> 56:17.777
- I mean I guess you could look
at it like that but I don't.

56:17.777 --> 56:18.955
If I could take it back I would

56:18.955 --> 56:23.162
but I don't think it was my fault.

56:23.162 --> 56:24.995
- That's very cryptic.

56:25.901 --> 56:29.450
Can I get a little more information?

56:29.450 --> 56:31.580
- Look, I know you're just
trying to get to know me

56:31.580 --> 56:35.757
but it's really not my
favorite topic of conversation.

56:36.890 --> 56:39.000
- Well generally the things
people hate talking about

56:39.000 --> 56:40.320
are the things they need to talk about.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.633
- Oh, thank you Yoda.

56:47.860 --> 56:48.693
I was married.

56:50.020 --> 56:50.853
Didn't end well.

56:53.490 --> 56:54.660
- Cheat?

56:54.660 --> 56:55.493
- No.

56:55.493 --> 56:56.617
Not that I know of.

56:59.510 --> 57:00.633
He was aggressive.

57:03.380 --> 57:04.213
- Like violent?

57:05.620 --> 57:06.453
- [Lila] Mm-hmm.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.010
- He still giving you any problems?

57:10.010 --> 57:10.843
- No.

57:11.770 --> 57:15.090
I got a restraining order and left town.

57:21.830 --> 57:23.913
- I would never hurt you.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.280
- I know.

57:32.748 --> 57:35.165
(soft music)

58:31.318 --> 58:32.151
Thank you.

58:37.420 --> 58:38.253
Hey.

58:40.430 --> 58:42.770
That night that you showed up

58:42.770 --> 58:44.883
at my house with the bloody nose.

58:47.540 --> 58:48.583
What happened?

58:50.702 --> 58:54.570
- I told you it was just
a occupational hazard.

58:54.570 --> 58:55.573
- Yeah, I remember.

58:56.860 --> 58:58.860
You didn't say what occupation that was.

59:05.090 --> 59:07.653
Okay, let me ask this.

59:09.170 --> 59:10.310
Is it the same occupation

59:10.310 --> 59:11.960
that got your brother in trouble?

59:13.940 --> 59:16.390
- Look, just don't talk about my brother.

59:16.390 --> 59:17.640
You don't know anything about him.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.030
- Well, that's why I'm asking.

59:19.030 --> 59:20.100
You wanna know about me,

59:20.100 --> 59:21.450
I wanna know about you too.

59:23.680 --> 59:24.513
- All right, yeah.

59:24.513 --> 59:26.300
I run with the same crew my brother does

59:26.300 --> 59:27.700
but it's not what you think.

59:30.074 --> 59:31.620
- I don't even know what I think.

59:31.620 --> 59:35.070
- Look, I just wanna make enough money

59:35.070 --> 59:37.253
to get my family out of the neighborhood.

59:38.160 --> 59:40.760
I mean, you think I want
my sister growing up there?

59:42.750 --> 59:43.874
- Do your parents know that?

59:43.874 --> 59:44.801
(Jason scoffs)

59:44.801 --> 59:45.634
- Are you out of your mind?

59:45.634 --> 59:46.467
They would flip.

59:48.690 --> 59:50.238
- So what does this work involve?

59:50.238 --> 59:52.033
- Oh my god, Lila.

59:52.033 --> 59:53.160
Give me a break.

59:53.160 --> 59:53.993
Come on.

59:53.993 --> 59:55.337
We had a good day today, didn't we?

59:58.150 --> 59:59.300
I don't wanna rock the boat

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.830
but I think you did a complete 180 today.

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:02.810
- No I haven't.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.700
I know this is still incredibly stupid

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.723
and reckless.

01:00:10.282 --> 01:00:11.880
But you're right.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.073
We had a good day and

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.380
I feel good when I'm with you.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.183
- Ditto.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.920
- You do know how serious

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.660
this could be for me,
right, if this got out?

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.803
Like I could end up in with your brother.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:28.523
- That's not funny.

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:29.356
- I'm not trying to be funny.

01:00:29.356 --> 01:00:30.420
I'm just trying to get you to understand

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.610
how serious this is.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:32.970
- I get it.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.143
Just give me a break.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.410
Look, no one's gonna find out.

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.683
I can promise you that.

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:41.543
- Okay.

01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:42.399
All I'm trying to say is--

01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:44.170
- [Jason] Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.730
- All right.

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:46.770
Just let me ask one more question.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.203
- Oh my god, Lila.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.872
- How did you know where I lived?

01:00:53.872 --> 01:00:56.122
(laughing)

01:00:58.073 --> 01:00:59.716
- I did my homework.

01:00:59.716 --> 01:01:01.966
(laughing)

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.333
- Touche.

01:01:09.612 --> 01:01:11.200
(tense music)

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.033
- [Thug] What's up, little man?

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:12.866
- What are you doing here?

01:01:12.866 --> 01:01:13.699
This is my house.

01:01:13.699 --> 01:01:14.977
- The fuck you just say?

01:01:14.977 --> 01:01:17.010
- You in my good graces, kid.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.360
You might wanna stay there.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.340
- You don't want us to have to teach you

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.253
another lesson again, do you?

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.470
- No.

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:26.303
- Good.

01:01:26.303 --> 01:01:27.840
We got work for you.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.760
- Yeah.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.070
We need a little debt collecting done.

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.420
- What?

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.600
No, I sell.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600
I'm good at selling.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.433
That's my job.

01:01:35.433 --> 01:01:36.840
- Think of it as a promotion.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.120
- Yeah.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.730
You wanted to take over
your brother's role, right?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.333
You gotta take on all
his responsibilities.

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:48.220
- [Thug] Here are the details.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.073
See it done.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:57.910
- [Thug] Tonight.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.830
- Mom?

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.663
- Oh.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.340
Just getting laundry.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.173
- Oh.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.163
Thanks.

01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:08.050
(tense music)

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.930
Yo Franklin, you're overdue!

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.191
- I can get it by next week!

01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.953
(fists thudding)
(Franklin grunting)

01:03:12.953 --> 01:03:14.225
I don't have it, I'm sorry!

01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.142
- Bullshit!

01:03:16.372 --> 01:03:17.205
Stay down!

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.477
Don't make me visit you again.

01:03:34.007 --> 01:03:35.541
(Jason panting)

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:38.124
(Jason coughs)

01:03:54.854 --> 01:03:55.700
(knocking on door)

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.370
- Knock, knock.

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.780
- Who's there?

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.590
- Sorry for interrupting.

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:01.470
- It's fine.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:02.783
You are always welcome.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.010
- I was just hoping to get

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.563
the student transfer
file for the Polish girl.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:13.510
- Oh, right.

01:04:14.436 --> 01:04:15.269
Here you go.

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:20.410
- Great.

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.130
Okay, well I better get going.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:25.070
Parents are gonna start
showing up anytime now.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:25.903
- Hey, Lila.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.613
I just wanted you to know
I'm okay with being friends.

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:32.980
I'm here if you need anything

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.150
and hopefully when you're
ready for something more,

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.123
you'll think of me.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:40.940
- That's sweet of you to say.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.192
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

01:04:54.192 --> 01:04:55.039
- Thank you.

01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.016
- [Lila] It was lovely to meet you.

01:04:56.016 --> 01:04:56.849
- Nice to meet you.

01:04:56.849 --> 01:04:57.682
- I'll see you next time.

01:04:57.682 --> 01:04:58.515
- See ya.

01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:03.799
- Mr and Mrs Galea.

01:05:04.773 --> 01:05:06.169
Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:07.991
- Come on in.

01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:10.824
(dissonant music)

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:22.890
Yeah, Daniel's a great kid.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.549
Anyway, thank you for coming in.

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:25.382
- [Mrs.Galea] Thank you so much.

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:26.215
- Great to meet you.

01:05:26.215 --> 01:05:27.048
- [Mrs.Galea] Nice to meet you too.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:28.102
- Same here, thank you.
- I'll see you next time.

01:05:28.102 --> 01:05:28.935
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

01:05:28.935 --> 01:05:29.935
- Take care.

01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:36.241
Mrs. Walker.

01:05:37.646 --> 01:05:38.479
Hi.

01:05:40.817 --> 01:05:41.734
Come on in.

01:05:47.753 --> 01:05:48.586
Please.

01:05:51.818 --> 01:05:53.477
Thank you so much for coming in.

01:05:53.477 --> 01:05:55.180
You know, it's important to us

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.420
that we establish an open
line of communication

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.810
with all of our parents so
that they have a feeling

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.560
for how their kids are progressing.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.990
So, I was pleased to learn
that Jason's a talented writer.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.923
- Yes, he tells me you've taken
quite the interest in him.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.810
- Yeah, I like to get to
know all of my students

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:19.900
so that they feel comfortable with me.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.060
- Well, you certainly have a unique way

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.410
of getting to know your students then.

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.623
Do you tutor them all?

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.520
- Um, no.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.410
Actually Jason came to me and then we--

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:32.023
- Don't you dare blame my son.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.103
- Excuse me?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.090
- Don't play dumb with me, girly.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.263
I am onto you.

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:41.360
What kind of sick methods are you using

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360
to get his grades up?

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.220
- It's not what you think.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.610
- Don't tell me what I think.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.930
This school is my kid's chance to get out,

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.103
to have a better life.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:54.090
Don't mess that up for him.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:56.133
- I'm trying to help him.

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.730
- You better end this.

01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:04.713
I am warning you!

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.890
- That was Mrs. Walker, right?

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.160
- Uh-huh.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.410
- Well, she didn't look very happy.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.163
- Um, I think she was just in a rush.

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:23.183
She's definitely happy with
Jason's improvement in grades.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.600
- Okay, well that's good.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.340
Listen, is everything all right, Lila?

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.230
You seem like you're a little--

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:32.763
- Sorry, I just, I have
just a bit of a headache.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.733
I'll be fine.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.840
- Well all right then.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.800
I'll leave you to it.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.633
- Thanks.

01:07:45.889 --> 01:07:48.340
- You'd better do something
about that headache

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.190
before it turns into something worse.

That's it, I'm out.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:13.821
- [Thug] (scoffs) Out.

01:08:13.821 --> 01:08:15.247
- Man, there is no out.

01:08:15.247 --> 01:08:17.660
- Yeah, even your brother knew that.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.979
Nah, homie.

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:20.020
You just gettin' started.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.120
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.520
We got a real big job this weekend

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.990
and we a man short.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.890
- [Thug] You're it.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:29.870
- What's the job?

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:30.703
- You know what?

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:33.660
I don't think you appreciate

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.220
the opportunities I'm giving you.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.060
- You got a big payday
coming your way, kid.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.390
- Yeah, it's time to
make big brother proud.

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:41.600
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.220
So I don't wanna hear
anymore of this out bullshit.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.073
Do you understand me?

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:49.810
- I'll be there.

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:51.613
- Ay, that's the spirit.

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:55.661
- [Thug] Fuck out of here.

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:58.408
- [Thug] (scoffs) Out.

01:08:58.408 --> 01:08:59.861
(laughs)

01:08:59.861 --> 01:09:01.296
I'm out.

01:09:01.296 --> 01:09:02.319
(imitates barking)

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.622
Little boy.

01:09:03.622 --> 01:09:04.893
Yo boy, he crazy.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.109
- [Shelly] Jason, can
you come here please?

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:20.689
- What's up, Mom?

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.710
- I wanted to ask how your study sessions

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:23.910
are going with Ms Kendy.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.633
- Good.

01:09:25.633 --> 01:09:27.189
I mean, you've seen my grades.

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:28.180
- It really seems like

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.270
the extra attention she's
giving you is paying off.

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.883
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.350
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:39.122
- What are you talking about?

01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:41.450
- I saw the photos on your phone, okay.

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.200
How can you be so stupid?
- Why are you going through

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.033
my stuff?

01:09:44.033 --> 01:09:45.870
- You think the church
will keep supporting you

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.819
being at that school when
this gets out, Jason?

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:48.710
And it will.

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:49.962
These things always do.

01:09:49.962 --> 01:09:51.620
- Mom, you're overreacting.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.660
- What's going on?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.729
- Your son.

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:55.100
He's diddling his teacher.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.060
- What?
- No, I'm not!

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.340
- [Shelly] He has
pictures of them together.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.713
- Mom, would you stop
and listen for a second?

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:01.730
- Oh, okay.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.850
I'll listen.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:05.083
You explain it to me so I can understand.

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:09.913
- Look, forget everything for one second.

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:11.970
We have a connection.

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.030
- A connection?

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.163
- Christ Shell, let the boy finish.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.445
- Look, the age thing,
her being my teacher,

01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:23.690
it's not important.

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.200
I love her.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.800
- Oh my god.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.700
Do you think this family
needs another scandal?

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.360
Okay, I can't take this.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.990
You're gonna cut it off, you hear me?

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.823
Get back here!

01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:34.843
I'm not finished!

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.700
- And then Aunt Katherine says to Grandma

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.710
that she can't have the cream.

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:46.773
Oh my god, then all hell broke loose.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:48.980
- Yeah, that's good.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.813
- Good?

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.400
What's good about it?

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.850
Are you even listening to me?

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.320
- I'm sorry Mom.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.890
I've just got a lot on my mind.

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:57.840
- Well like what?

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.290
Is everything okay at school?

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:01.850
- I don't know.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.154
I just, it's complicated.

01:11:04.154 --> 01:11:05.709
(sighs)

01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:07.970
I think I might be in trouble.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:11.550
- Asshole hasn't breached his
restraining order, has he?

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:12.736
- No.

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:14.043
- Well, what is it then?

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:16.370
Have things gone sour with Andrew?

01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:18.070
- No, it's nothing to do with him.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.420
- Well, spit it out, Lila.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.800
- Remember I told you I met someone?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.080
- Oh, the younger guy.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.660
But I thought that wasn't going anywhere.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.520
- Yeah well...

01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:35.050
I don't even know what to say

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.160
'cause I don't want you to flip out.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.660
- [Mary] Why would I flip out?

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:44.223
- I met him at school too.

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:48.650
- Lila, you can't go dating
men that work together.

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:50.243
It's like dating brothers.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.203
- He's not a teacher.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.153
Mom?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.660
- What do you expect me to say?

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:08.493
Honestly?

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.201
- I don't know.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.460
I just needed to tell someone.

01:12:14.487 --> 01:12:16.460
- Here I was thinking

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.510
that I didn't have to
worry about you anymore

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.480
because you were getting a fresh start.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.900
Do you realize you're throwing
all of that away right now?

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.130
Have you even thought about
the consequences of this?

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:28.560
- I didn't do it on purpose.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.530
It just happened.

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:31.360
- Oh for Christ's sake, Lila!

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.193
Grow up!

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:35.113
Take some responsibility.

01:12:37.678 --> 01:12:39.590
Do you realize that getting involved

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:42.233
with a student is criminal?

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.333
Do you even know that?

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.580
I can't even talk to you right now.

01:12:49.102 --> 01:12:49.935
- Hey sis.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.653
- Hi Dale.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.040
- What is Mom talking about?

01:12:56.144 --> 01:12:56.977
- Nothing.

01:12:57.962 --> 01:12:59.050
It's nothing.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:02.143
- Look, you got something
good going right now.

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:04.820
All right, don't screw it up.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.090
- [John] It's not like he's 12.

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.410
He's practically an adult.

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:14.010
- You cannot be serious.

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.260
- We were already together at his age.

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.950
- That's completely different.

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:19.390
You were only a few years older

01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:21.670
and you weren't my freakin' teacher.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.450
- All I'm saying is that he's past the age

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:25.090
of being taken advantage of.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.840
- Are you joking?

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.190
You would not be this
calm if it was Penny.

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.023
- Hey, that's ridiculous.

01:13:30.023 --> 01:13:31.330
Penny is only 13.

01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:33.830
- I am saying in a few years.

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:35.690
If Penny got involved with a male teacher

01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:37.183
you would blow a gasket.

01:13:37.183 --> 01:13:38.550
- That's different.

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:40.393
- [Shelly] Why, why is that different?

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.070
- 'Cause I know what men are like.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:44.910
- Well, I know how some women are

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:45.743
and I'm telling you,

01:13:45.743 --> 01:13:47.093
she is taking advantage.

01:13:48.945 --> 01:13:51.862
(knocking on door)

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:54.423
- Look Lila--
- You can't be here.

01:13:54.423 --> 01:13:55.880
- Why?
- We can't do this anymore.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.870
- Why?
- Why didn't you tell me

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:57.874
that your mother knows about us?

01:13:57.874 --> 01:13:58.707
- [Jason] Shit, what happened?

01:13:58.707 --> 01:14:00.350
- She came to the school.

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:01.183
- Fuck!
- Why didn't you warn me?

01:14:01.183 --> 01:14:02.820
You know how much trouble
that I could get in.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.730
- Look, I didn't know.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:04.563
I'm sorry, I just found out.

01:14:04.563 --> 01:14:06.057
- [Lila] She was this close to
Principal Gibney overhearing.

01:14:06.057 --> 01:14:06.890
- Okay, no.

01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:08.040
You're just, calm down.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.885
- Calm down?

01:14:08.885 --> 01:14:10.427
I could go to jail, I
could lose my fucking job.

01:14:10.427 --> 01:14:11.260
- Shh.
- Don't shush me!

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.093
Don't you get it?

01:14:12.093 --> 01:14:12.926
Shannen was there as well.

01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:13.759
She knows.

01:14:13.759 --> 01:14:15.100
Now it's just a matter of
time before this gets out.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.240
- You're just being paranoid.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.390
- No, you're being naive.

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:18.380
I should've known that you wouldn't have

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.228
the maturity to deal with this.

01:14:19.228 --> 01:14:20.115
- Lila, Lila.

01:14:20.115 --> 01:14:21.332
- Just go.
- No, Lila.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:24.582
- Just go.
- I just wanna talk about it!

01:14:26.919 --> 01:14:27.752
Oh shit.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.721
Lila, I'm sorry.

01:14:29.721 --> 01:14:30.554
- Get out.

01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.134
(gentle music)

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:33.986
(paper rustling)

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:55.765
(knocking on door)

01:16:40.087 --> 01:16:42.587
(Lila laughs)

01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:46.548
- What do you wanna do?

01:16:47.992 --> 01:16:48.825
- I don't know.

01:16:48.825 --> 01:16:50.710
I just definitely got the impression

01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.263
Gibney suspected something.

01:16:53.316 --> 01:16:55.840
I don't have a good feeling about this.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.290
- You're just being paranoid.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.870
If she overheard, she
would've said something.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.640
- Well I'm not being
paranoid about Miss James.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.370
She definitely knows something.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.440
Somehow I don't get the impression

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.230
that she can be trusted.

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.713
This is a fucking nightmare.

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:12.760
- Thanks.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.470
- You know what I mean.

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:15.760
This is dangerous for me.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.620
It's just a matter of time

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.130
before Shannen says something to someone

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:20.643
or your mom goes to the
school or the police.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.293
- What if we left?

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.410
What if we left town?

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.110
I mean, if you resign

01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:41.400
and then you don't have to worry

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.270
about losing your job

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:44.330
and so if you're not my teacher,

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:45.820
there's no issues.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.070
- No.

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:48.223
- I have money.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.933
- Absolutely not.

01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:51.270
I'm not using your family's money.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.353
- It's my money.

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:55.440
I choose what I wanna do with it.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.170
Right now this is what's important.

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.673
Lila, I need this too.

01:18:06.893 --> 01:18:10.180
Can you just promise me

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.773
that you'll at least think
about what I've said?

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.637
I want you to consider
it as a legit option.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.173
- Okay.

01:18:24.138 --> 01:18:25.293
I'll think about it.

01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:30.027
- Don't wanna be late for school.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:36.584
(gentle music)

01:19:03.052 --> 01:19:05.802
(car horn honks)

01:19:19.197 --> 01:19:21.947
- Probably about 15 more minutes.

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.409
- Sorry Miss.

01:19:27.178 --> 01:19:28.011
So have you given any thought

01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:28.937
to what we discussed in the morning?

01:19:28.937 --> 01:19:31.668
- Jason, we shouldn't be
discussing this in public.

01:19:31.668 --> 01:19:32.543
- Well, have you?

01:19:34.424 --> 01:19:37.174
(dramatic music)

01:19:59.082 --> 01:19:59.915
- Hey.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:02.270
You want a cup of coffee?

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:03.103
- No.

01:20:05.362 --> 01:20:07.162
What do you know about Jason Walker?

01:20:08.344 --> 01:20:09.947
- Kendy would know more
about him than I would.

01:20:09.947 --> 01:20:11.203
- What does that mean?

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.570
- Why are you wasting your time with her?

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:15.600
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.660
- Oh fuck off, Shannen.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.660
Why are you always such a fucking bitch?

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:22.410
- I'm just saying.

01:20:35.486 --> 01:20:36.319
- 'Sup bro?

01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:37.152
- [Jason] Hey.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.820
How's it going?
- Chillin', bro.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.653
How you doin'?

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.150
- So it's your lucky day today.

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.480
I'm running a midweek special.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.090
It's 20% off when you
buy two or more bags.

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:48.930
- Shit.

01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:50.090
Well, if that's the case,

01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:51.273
let us get two then, bro.

01:20:51.273 --> 01:20:52.523
- [Jason] All right,
that's what I like to hear.

01:20:52.523 --> 01:20:53.356
- Yeah.

01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:04.167
- [Jason] There you go man.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.810
- What are you in such a good mood for?

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.370
- Love.

01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:13.420
All you need is love.

01:21:20.294 --> 01:21:21.350
(knocking on door)

01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:23.470
- Mom wants you to come down for dinner.

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:24.750
What's that?

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.583
- It's nothing.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.114
Hey Penny, can you wait a sec?

01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:29.211
- Come on, I'm hungry.

01:21:29.211 --> 01:21:31.081
- Come on, I just wanna
give you something.

01:21:31.081 --> 01:21:32.164
Come on, sit.

01:21:44.194 --> 01:21:46.710
(laughs)

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.690
- Your bunny?

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:49.590
I didn't even know you still had that.

01:21:51.038 --> 01:21:52.238
- Well you can have him.

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:55.183
- Really?

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:57.340
Why?

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.173
- Well you always wanted him

01:21:58.173 --> 01:21:59.627
more than I ever did, so.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.203
- I'm a bit old for it now, but thanks.

01:22:05.079 --> 01:22:08.000
- And you know I love you.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.833
- Yeah.

01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:12.293
- Okay, good.

01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:16.560
- Why are you being so weird?

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.080
- Weird?

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.830
You're the one playing with a bunny.

01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:20.800
Freak.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.450
Come on, let's get you some food.

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:37.894
- Hey.
- Oh shit!

01:22:37.894 --> 01:22:38.727
(laughs)

01:22:38.727 --> 01:22:40.021
Andrew, you scared the shit out of me.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:40.854
What are you, what are you doing?

01:22:40.854 --> 01:22:41.971
- You need a man, Lila.

01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:43.147
- Stop!

01:22:43.147 --> 01:22:44.880
Stop!
- I know your ex hurt you.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.480
That's not how real men act.
- What are you?

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.360
Stop it, Andrew.
- And now you're stuck

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.467
with a boy.

01:22:48.467 --> 01:22:50.135
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:22:50.135 --> 01:22:50.968
- Stop!

01:22:50.968 --> 01:22:52.254
- You need a man for that.

01:22:52.254 --> 01:22:53.715
(Lila sobbing)

01:22:53.715 --> 01:22:54.548
Stop!

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.803
Andrew, stop!

01:23:42.025 --> 01:23:44.942
(knocking on door)

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:52.223
Who is it?

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:54.333
- [Jason] Me.

01:23:57.605 --> 01:23:59.522
- It's not a good time.

01:24:01.283 --> 01:24:02.746
- What?

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:03.596
What do you mean?

01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:12.543
What's wrong?

01:24:14.479 --> 01:24:15.312
- Nothing.

01:24:27.226 --> 01:24:28.059
- What is it?

01:24:28.059 --> 01:24:29.226
What happened?

01:24:31.101 --> 01:24:33.829
(Lila crying)

01:24:33.829 --> 01:24:34.662
- I can't tell you.

01:24:34.662 --> 01:24:37.280
- No, you can tell me anything.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.113
Come on, please.

01:24:38.113 --> 01:24:38.946
You're scaring me.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.233
- Andrew.

01:24:48.572 --> 01:24:49.989
- What about him?

01:24:52.582 --> 01:24:54.497
What the fuck did he do to you?

01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:11.311
That motherfucker.

01:25:11.311 --> 01:25:12.320
I'm gonna fucking kill--

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.293
- Stop, please.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.310
- Well let's call the police.

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:24.490
We gotta call the police

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.323
or do something.

01:25:25.323 --> 01:25:27.010
Let's call the police.
- No, we can't.

01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:27.910
- [Jason] Why not?

01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:31.043
- He knows.

01:25:33.647 --> 01:25:35.250
- About what?

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.083
- About us.

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.823
- Oh.

01:25:41.706 --> 01:25:42.840
What, how?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.143
How's he know?
- I don't.

01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:50.370
- [Jason] What'd he say?

01:25:57.809 --> 01:25:59.392
- That you're a boy

01:26:00.838 --> 01:26:02.038
and that I needed a man.

01:26:04.882 --> 01:26:05.715
- Oh.

01:26:06.766 --> 01:26:09.266
(Lila crying)

01:26:14.143 --> 01:26:16.363
- [Lila] I can't wait to get out of here.

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.673
- Let's leave now.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.840
Let's leave tonight.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.205
We'd have to just--

01:26:26.205 --> 01:26:27.205
- [Lila] No.

01:26:28.062 --> 01:26:28.895
- What?

01:26:28.895 --> 01:26:29.728
- Tomorrow.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.380
I have to go to school

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.870
and put in my resignation
and get my things.

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:36.340
- [Jason] You wanna go back there?

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.820
Come on.
- I have to.

01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.890
- No, what if he tries something again?

01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:40.723
You can't--
- He won't.

01:26:40.723 --> 01:26:42.100
Not in front of other people.

01:26:43.153 --> 01:26:44.210
I'll be fine.

01:26:46.292 --> 01:26:47.785
- Lila.

01:26:47.785 --> 01:26:49.868
- It's just one more day.

01:27:01.944 --> 01:27:02.861
I love you.

01:27:04.505 --> 01:27:06.588
- [Jason] I love you too.

01:27:23.621 --> 01:27:25.624
(Andrew chuckles)

01:27:25.624 --> 01:27:28.374
(dramatic music)

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.207
(students chattering)

01:27:50.795 --> 01:27:52.284
- We don't think that you
should deduct points from us

01:27:52.284 --> 01:27:53.534
because we're--

01:27:55.952 --> 01:27:58.119
- Discuss more about that.

01:27:58.962 --> 01:28:00.830
(Jason claps)

01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:01.940
- Hey, Matthews.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.390
So you're a man now, huh?

01:28:04.268 --> 01:28:06.851
(men grunting)

01:28:09.759 --> 01:28:10.798
- Stop it!

01:28:10.798 --> 01:28:11.631
Jason!

01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:12.464
Stop!

01:28:14.130 --> 01:28:14.963
Stop it!

01:28:14.963 --> 01:28:15.796
- Fuck you!

01:28:15.796 --> 01:28:17.129
- [Teacher] Stop it.

01:28:17.966 --> 01:28:18.799
Stop it.

01:28:18.799 --> 01:28:19.632
Stop.

01:28:19.632 --> 01:28:20.465
- Get off!

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:29.993
- You're done.

01:28:47.314 --> 01:28:49.814
- [Policeman] Watch your step.

01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:16.464
- [Shelly] Come on.

01:29:16.464 --> 01:29:17.297
I swear to God, Jason.

01:29:17.297 --> 01:29:18.130
- [Lila] Jason.

01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:18.963
Are you okay?

01:29:18.963 --> 01:29:19.796
What happened?

01:29:19.796 --> 01:29:20.940
- You stay away from my son

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:21.773
or so help me God,

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:22.690
I will walk back in there

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.583
and have you thrown in jail.

01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:24.900
- Mom, mom!

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:27.366
- [Shelly] Get in the car, Jason.

01:29:27.366 --> 01:29:28.936
Now.

01:29:28.936 --> 01:29:29.769
- Jason.

01:29:29.769 --> 01:29:31.317
- Get in the car.

01:29:31.317 --> 01:29:32.150
Now.

01:29:39.257 --> 01:29:41.690
I told you to stay away from him.

01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:42.523
He is a child.

01:29:42.523 --> 01:29:43.356
What is wrong with you?

01:29:43.356 --> 01:29:44.780
- I just want to know if he's okay.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:46.710
What happened with the police?

01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:47.543
- Go back to where you came from

01:29:47.543 --> 01:29:49.403
and leave my boy alone.

01:29:55.381 --> 01:29:56.339
Don't look.

01:29:56.339 --> 01:29:57.569
Come on.

01:29:57.569 --> 01:30:00.402
(dissonant music)

01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.487
(bell rings)

01:31:02.043 --> 01:31:04.710
(phone ringing)

01:31:14.609 --> 01:31:17.109
(tense music)

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.450
- I knew you'd come around.

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:48.623
- You raped me, Andrew.

01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:51.613
- Come on.

01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:56.260
- I'm filing a report tomorrow.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.960
So you can expect a visit from the police.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.040
- You're out of your mind.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.873
- [Lila] Am I?

01:32:00.873 --> 01:32:01.706
- Yes.

01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:04.990
- You know the security cameras

01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:06.390
that monitor the schoolyard?

01:32:08.987 --> 01:32:09.820
Well there's one that points

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.293
directly at my classroom window.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.910
- So why tell me now?

01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.020
Why not just go straight to the police?

01:32:25.853 --> 01:32:27.940
- Because I'm giving you the opportunity

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.173
to make something right.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.233
- What?

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.393
- Jason.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.890
Tell the police whatever you have to

01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:41.510
to make sure he gets in as
little trouble as possible.

01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:44.120
- Why would I do anything to help him?

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.640
- Because I am not fucking around

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.290
when I tell you that I
will go down with you

01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:48.663
if I have to to save him.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.990
- What am I supposed to say?

01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.890
- I don't care.

01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:00.940
Whatever you have to.

01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:03.493
If you do that,

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.660
I won't press charges

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:09.303
and you're gonna resign.

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:13.923
- This is a fucking joke.

01:33:27.897 --> 01:33:30.814
(knocking on door)

01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:42.533
- Oh fuck, I missed you.

01:33:48.767 --> 01:33:50.710
I have good news.

01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:51.849
- Well that would make a nice change.

01:33:51.849 --> 01:33:52.682
- Yeah.

01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:56.650
The police are just gonna
let me off with a warning.

01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:59.250
Apparently Matthews didn't
even wanna press charges.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.263
Aren't you happy?

01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:11.116
You're almost all packed up.

01:34:11.116 --> 01:34:12.449
- [Lila] Uh-huh.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.763
- Well is everything okay?

01:34:23.005 --> 01:34:23.838
- Jason.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.563
- Shit.

01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:30.050
All right, what now?

01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:31.420
Just, come on.

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.600
Just, what?

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.433
Say it.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.200
- You're not coming with me.

01:34:48.205 --> 01:34:49.038
- What?

01:34:49.038 --> 01:34:50.720
- We need to start being
realistic about this.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.627
- What are you talking about?

01:34:51.627 --> 01:34:53.850
We had it all planned out.

01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:56.140
- You need to stay here with your parents

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.020
and be in school and start
thinking about college

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.630
and girls your own age.

01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:02.839
- I don't want girls my own age.

01:35:02.839 --> 01:35:03.756
I want you.

01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:07.353
- I let this go on for
longer than I should have

01:35:07.353 --> 01:35:09.393
and I'm sorry about that.

01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:14.804
But you just still have so
much more growing up to do.

01:35:14.804 --> 01:35:15.637
- Don't.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.473
Don't do that.

01:35:17.473 --> 01:35:18.306
Don't just treat me like

01:35:18.306 --> 01:35:19.403
I'm some sort of child or something.

01:35:19.403 --> 01:35:20.740
- I don't mean it like that.

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.630
I just...

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.410
Jason, I have told you you're so smart

01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:29.627
and you can do whatever you want in life.

01:35:31.473 --> 01:35:34.090
But you still have so
much more to experience

01:35:34.090 --> 01:35:35.590
before you get to where I am

01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:38.817
and it would be unfair of me
to take that away from you.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.130
- Well what about me, hmm?

01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:42.963
What about what I want?

01:35:42.963 --> 01:35:44.260
I mean, don't I get a say?

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:49.050
- Take this as your get
out of jail free card.

01:35:50.530 --> 01:35:51.363
Literally.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.059
- So I just never meant anything to you,

01:35:54.059 --> 01:35:55.943
is that what it is?
- You know that's not true.

01:35:57.907 --> 01:36:00.490
(Jason crying)

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.745
Fuck.

01:36:03.745 --> 01:36:04.578
Lila.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.970

Without me.

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.300

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.400
but you have your whole life ahead of you.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.010
It's exactly what you wanted.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.070

to see my son in pain?

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.773
Trust me, I know you
don't wanna hear this,

01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:17.840
but there will be more girls

01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:20.493
and more heartbreaks.

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:26.489
It hurts now but eventually
it'll just be a memory.

01:38:26.489 --> 01:38:28.453

01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:26.638
Hello?

01:40:26.638 --> 01:40:28.053
- [Thug] Hey little man, it's go time.

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:33.320
Hey, you hear me?

01:40:34.818 --> 01:40:36.090
- Yeah.

01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:36.923
- [Thug] Get over here now

01:40:36.923 --> 01:40:38.030
so we can go over the plan then.

01:40:41.718 --> 01:40:42.718
- All right.

01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:19.853
[Jason] What happens happens for a reason.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.190
Though those reasons remain unknown.

01:41:24.973 --> 01:41:26.653
It won't be this bad forever.

01:41:28.407 --> 01:41:30.473
Though you feel like you walk alone.

01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:36.203
I can hear somebody screaming.

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:40.003
I hear fear and agony.

01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:45.483
Frantic I open my eyes.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.023
I realize that somebody is me.

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.540
- [Lila] You cannot change what happened

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:08.233
no matter how hard you try.

01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:13.300
You cannot turn back the hands of time

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.763
no matter how much you cry.

01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:19.093
Dark times make you stronger.

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:22.473
Though sometimes cold and withdrawn.

01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:27.323
When it feels too much remember,

01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:31.923
it's always darkest before the dawn.
