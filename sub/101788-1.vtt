00:56.246 --> 00:58.850
Hi, sorry,
would you like to sit down?

00:58.982 --> 01:00.617
Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:02.319 --> 01:04.489
You'll feel the pole
right beside you.

01:04.822 --> 01:05.924
Oh, yes, cheers.

02:44.822 --> 02:46.623
Sorry.

02:47.457 --> 02:48.659
That dream again.

02:51.427 --> 02:53.298
- Did I yell out?
- Yeah.

02:54.431 --> 02:55.767
- Sorry.
- No,

02:55.900 --> 02:57.635
I'm just glad
you got some sleep.

02:58.534 --> 02:59.436
Yeah.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.908
Shall I open the curtains?

03:07.811 --> 03:09.881
- What time is it?
- 8:15.

03:10.014 --> 03:13.484
Is it?
Such a deep sleep.

03:14.518 --> 03:16.054
Dream is so real.

03:17.487 --> 03:18.588
I'll run you a bath.

03:18.722 --> 03:19.757
Thanks.

03:53.824 --> 03:55.093
He's gone.

03:58.461 --> 03:59.930
That fucking cello.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.469
Doesn't that drive you mad?

04:08.739 --> 04:12.075
I love the rhythm.
So does Hunter.

04:13.911 --> 04:16.947
- What time are you back?
- About six?

04:17.581 --> 04:20.151
You're alright with it?
The play?

04:20.283 --> 04:23.788
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

04:24.788 --> 04:25.590
See you.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.802
Hunter.

04:38.334 --> 04:40.437
Come here.

04:41.737 --> 04:43.040
Hunter.

04:44.708 --> 04:45.843
Stupid cat.

05:08.365 --> 05:12.103
Allain...
Cordelia.

05:18.509 --> 05:19.911
Okay. Well, um,
I'm just going to keep

05:20.043 --> 05:22.180
talking on the off chance
that you pick up.

05:23.913 --> 05:26.950
Um, I'm on my way
to rehearsal and, um,

05:27.550 --> 05:31.122
well, I thought maybe we could
talk on the break at lunch time.

05:32.689 --> 05:34.759
It'd be nice to catch up, maybe.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.898
Um, did Caroline tell you
that I'm in theater?

05:41.899 --> 05:43.067
Anyway, um.

05:47.870 --> 05:49.173
Okay, bye.

05:53.911 --> 05:55.612
Oh, fuck, fuck.

05:58.882 --> 06:01.151
"Which of you shall
we say doth love us most.

06:01.285 --> 06:03.788
That we,
our largest bounty may extend

06:03.920 --> 06:08.024
where nature doth with merit challenge?
Goneril, our eldest born speaks first."

06:08.158 --> 06:10.694
"Sir, I love you more than words
can wield the matter,

06:10.795 --> 06:12.963
dearer than eyesight
space and liberty,

06:13.096 --> 06:16.500
beyond what can be valued rich or
rare, no less than life..."

06:18.235 --> 06:20.204
Yeah, that's not his real hair,
you know?

06:20.637 --> 06:23.841
- Maybe it's a weave.
- You can't weave into that.

06:25.242 --> 06:26.611
What do you think?

06:27.944 --> 06:30.615
- About what?
- Roger's rug!

06:30.947 --> 06:32.716
- Oh...
- And another thing...

06:33.184 --> 06:35.653
...where's that fucking
publicity woman with my...

06:42.291 --> 06:46.897
Cordelia. Cordelia.
I thought it was you.

06:47.598 --> 06:51.269
- It's me. Ignore the beard.
- Stephen.

06:51.601 --> 06:53.137
I thought you'd gone to America.

06:53.269 --> 06:55.305
Yeah, I did.
I've been back about a month.

06:56.273 --> 06:58.809
- How are you?
- Yeah, good.

06:58.942 --> 07:01.778
I'm pretty...
quite busy and in a rush.

07:01.911 --> 07:03.548
- Going...
- I'll walk with you.

07:03.947 --> 07:05.248
- Okay.
- If that's okay.

07:05.382 --> 07:06.716
Sure.

07:11.754 --> 07:15.192
You look good, different,
but good.

07:15.324 --> 07:17.728
So do you, different.

07:18.762 --> 07:20.598
Are you working? Acting?

07:21.031 --> 07:23.600
Yeah, I'm, I'm in the theater
at the moment,

07:23.733 --> 07:26.236
Donmar just as an understudy.

07:26.836 --> 07:28.338
Do you want to grab a coffee?

07:28.471 --> 07:30.240
Oh, I can't, Stephen. I'm sorry.

07:31.274 --> 07:32.843
Well, maybe another time.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.878
- Yeah.
- I should grab your number.

07:35.379 --> 07:36.881
Yeah, um.

07:38.781 --> 07:39.817
Your number?

07:40.250 --> 07:43.019
It was, it was just
by chance that we met.

07:44.187 --> 07:45.790
Yeah, you're probably right.

07:48.057 --> 07:49.259
I'm going to walk away.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.829
Cordelia, I can't imagine
what it must have been

07:52.963 --> 07:54.799
like for you
these last few years.

07:56.833 --> 07:59.670
You were the last person I saw
before I got on that tube.

08:00.836 --> 08:01.838
Yeah, I know.

08:03.673 --> 08:06.743
- It was nice to see you.
- It was nice to see you too.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.383
Hey.

08:46.982 --> 08:48.118
You must live here.

08:54.857 --> 08:56.059
It's quite unnerving.

08:57.293 --> 09:00.398
- Sorry, I'm being so rude. Um...
- Oh, you're back.

09:00.530 --> 09:03.299
Matt, this is my sister,
Cordelia.

09:03.432 --> 09:05.970
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Have you?

09:06.503 --> 09:08.038
Stop staring at her.

09:08.505 --> 09:11.741
- Get a cold one from the fridge.
- Right. Yes.

09:17.514 --> 09:18.448
You alright?

09:22.184 --> 09:24.721
- What did you tell him?
- Not a lot.

09:25.254 --> 09:26.389
Just what happened to you.

09:26.523 --> 09:29.026
- Shouldn't have.
- It's not a secret.

09:29.558 --> 09:32.028
You need to stop
shutting people out.

09:44.941 --> 09:47.077
- I bumped into Stephen.
- Stephen!

09:47.211 --> 09:48.846
Jesus Christ.

09:48.979 --> 09:53.017
- A blast from the past.
- It was weird, seeing him.

09:55.217 --> 09:59.355
I just want to feel
normal, no reminders.

10:01.158 --> 10:03.494
I was beginning to,
you know, but...

10:03.793 --> 10:05.730
Now it's... I don't know.

10:05.863 --> 10:08.733
Stop it. It's all fine.

10:18.274 --> 10:20.244
So, what do you think?

10:20.376 --> 10:22.812
- What about?
- Matt!

10:23.913 --> 10:25.783
- Nice
- Nice?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.251
- What's nice mean?
- Nice?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.090
- I'm going away for the weekend.
- What?

10:34.356 --> 10:36.392
- When?
- In the morning.

10:36.525 --> 10:39.429
Bruges. He just showed up
with the tickets.

10:40.096 --> 10:43.167
- Don't go, please.
- I'm back on Monday.

10:43.634 --> 10:45.135
Look, you've been doing
so well lately.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.403
You'll be fine.

10:48.572 --> 10:50.541
Only because you've been here.

10:57.947 --> 11:00.150
Hunter.

11:01.384 --> 11:02.552
Cordelia.

11:03.186 --> 11:06.322
- Do you want a glass of wine?
- Just a sec.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.364
Bruges.

11:19.068 --> 11:20.904
Oh, there you are, drink?

11:22.239 --> 11:23.941
No, I've got work to do.

11:25.575 --> 11:28.479
- Do you mind Matt having a smoke?
- No.

11:33.149 --> 11:34.585
- We should make a move.
- Yeah.

11:35.585 --> 11:36.487
Do you want to come with us?

11:36.620 --> 11:37.988
I mean, it's just drinks.

11:38.355 --> 11:41.125
- I'm sure they won't mind.
- No, I've got work to do.

11:42.958 --> 11:45.495
- At what time are you going tomorrow?
- Crack of dawn.

11:45.629 --> 11:48.065
We've got to get
the train at 6:30.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.038
- You alright?
- Yeah.

11:55.706 --> 11:57.374
I promise we won't be late.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.453
Have fun!

13:06.710 --> 13:09.613
- Hello.
- <i>I think I left my keys on the floor on the flat.</i>

13:10.145 --> 13:13.082
<i>You're alright to wait up for us?
Do you have rehearsals tomorrow?</i>

13:13.216 --> 13:15.919
No, I can let you in.
I don't have to be there until 11:00.

13:16.052 --> 13:18.087
<i>I'll be back before midnight.
Promise.</i>

13:19.221 --> 13:21.357
- I'll see you later.
- <i>Oh, thank you.</i>

13:21.490 --> 13:22.525
Bye.

13:43.413 --> 13:45.416
You scared the shit out of me.

13:50.653 --> 13:51.555
There you go.

13:53.188 --> 13:54.991
There you go.

13:55.557 --> 13:56.626
Oh, God.

14:08.370 --> 14:09.605
Thank you so much.

14:09.739 --> 14:11.475
The door shut behind me.

14:11.607 --> 14:14.243
I found a mouse in my flat,
so I was putting it outside.

14:14.376 --> 14:16.079
You didn't catch it, did you?

14:16.513 --> 14:20.050
They're vermin. You'll catch
something from that.

14:21.451 --> 14:22.720
At least then
we don't have rats.

14:22.852 --> 14:25.021
Hey, you know what they say.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.591
If you got mice,
you got no rats.

14:27.691 --> 14:32.028
Oh, I see your sister is back, isn't she?

14:32.495 --> 14:34.564
- Yeah...
- Tell me, how's your father?

14:34.932 --> 14:37.467
- Oh, um, he died, Mr. Moses.
- Oh...

14:37.600 --> 14:39.202
No, no, no, some time ago.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.472
- Um, anyway, thank you for letting me in.
- Yeah.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.341
Oh, uh, have they started
the sewers?

14:45.808 --> 14:48.745
- I hate fucking rats.
- I tell you, I do.

14:48.879 --> 14:52.750
I'm glad you found the mouse,
no rats here then.

14:52.883 --> 14:54.785
That's alright. Thank you.

15:16.538 --> 15:17.540
Hello?

15:36.426 --> 15:37.561
Is anyone there?

15:39.662 --> 15:41.398
Stop calling this number.

16:19.836 --> 16:23.706
<i>You were
called today at 9:35 p.m.,</i>

16:24.173 --> 16:26.175
<i>the caller withheld their
number.</i>

17:08.317 --> 17:10.287
<i>Hello.</i>

17:21.564 --> 17:24.634
Sorry, sorry,
I got her home too late.

17:25.035 --> 17:27.871
We rang the landline.
You were asleep?

17:28.003 --> 17:30.540
- No.
- Why didn't you answer then?

17:31.907 --> 17:33.276
I'm going to bed.

17:33.410 --> 17:34.945
Yeah, I think,
I think we are too.

17:37.614 --> 17:39.482
- Is she alright?
- Yeah, no, she'll be fine.

17:39.615 --> 17:42.185
Just come on, come on,
go on. I'll talk to her.

17:49.558 --> 17:52.762
- I'll be right back.
- I'll put my pajamas on.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.602
Is there something
wrong with you?

17:59.970 --> 18:02.206
The phone rang
at least three times tonight.

18:02.338 --> 18:05.208
For fuck's sake, Cordelia,
it was probably a sales call.

18:05.342 --> 18:06.777
They didn't say anything
three times.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.312
You've got to stop this.

18:09.078 --> 18:12.215
You need to start living in a real
world with other people in it.

18:12.348 --> 18:16.220
- Not this half existing.
- Maybe I wasn't meant to exist.

18:16.353 --> 18:18.288
Maybe I was meant
to fucking die.

18:18.954 --> 18:22.425
No, I'm not doing
this. I'm not doing this.

18:22.558 --> 18:25.596
I'm going to go next door...

18:46.148 --> 18:48.317
Stop!

20:33.623 --> 20:34.758
What is this?

20:35.290 --> 20:37.461
"Look,
I'm sorry about last night.

20:38.728 --> 20:41.698
We're off to Bruges
with big hangovers.

20:43.732 --> 20:46.102
I hope you still aren't upset.

20:48.471 --> 20:52.108
Have a nice weekend without us,
and we'll see you bright

20:52.241 --> 20:53.909
and early Monday morning.

20:55.912 --> 20:58.749
Remember how strong you are.

20:59.648 --> 21:02.752
Try not to dwell on things,
my sweetheart.

21:02.885 --> 21:05.422
All my love, C and Matt."

21:31.547 --> 21:32.883
Is this chair free?

21:33.682 --> 21:37.421
Oh, yes, it is, please.

21:37.554 --> 21:39.723
Oh, did I make you jump?

21:40.457 --> 21:43.527
No, I was just reading,
I was miles away.

21:45.994 --> 21:47.129
You live below me.

21:47.797 --> 21:51.735
- Yes, I hear you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.736
There's nothing worse
than hearing someone practice.

21:53.869 --> 21:55.938
No, I love it.

21:56.873 --> 21:58.074
It never bothers me.

22:00.809 --> 22:02.211
Well, if it does, just, uh,

22:02.679 --> 22:04.480
you know, get a broom,

22:05.114 --> 22:06.817
bang on the ceiling
and I'll stop.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.019
Frank. My name is Frank Ryan.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.154
Cordelia Russell.

22:13.189 --> 22:14.658
It's funny because I hear you,

22:14.790 --> 22:16.525
but I've never
actually seen you.

22:17.058 --> 22:20.129
My sister has.
We are identical twins.

22:20.497 --> 22:22.932
- Only to look at.
- Oh.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.869
That would account for it.

22:26.568 --> 22:27.570
Account for what?

22:27.836 --> 22:29.172
Well, I practice
in the window and I,

22:29.305 --> 22:31.608
I've seen you lots of times,
but obviously...

22:31.740 --> 22:33.477
it wasn't always you.

22:33.609 --> 22:34.577
No.

22:36.979 --> 22:39.149
Promise you'll bang on the
ceiling if it drives you mad.

22:39.281 --> 22:41.116
I think it's really beautiful.

22:42.785 --> 22:43.987
Oh, sorry,
do you mind if I get this?

22:44.119 --> 22:45.054
No.

22:46.588 --> 22:47.490
Hello.

22:48.023 --> 22:50.226
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah.

22:50.727 --> 22:54.064
Yeah. No, I'm just having
a coffee with my neighbor.

22:54.364 --> 22:57.534
No. No, she seems very nice,

22:57.666 --> 22:59.602
and she isn't complaining
about my playing.

23:00.636 --> 23:03.874
Yeah, I miss you. No,
I think you'd really like it,

23:04.307 --> 23:07.176
and the area...
I found this lovely little pub

23:07.309 --> 23:09.712
in a couple of mews
about five minutes away.

23:10.012 --> 23:13.849
Yeah. Yeah, well, go to bed.
I'll ring you when you wake up.

23:13.982 --> 23:14.951
All right.

23:17.319 --> 23:18.821
All right. All right. Bye.

23:19.154 --> 23:20.956
- Sorry, have you paid?
- No.

23:21.089 --> 23:23.158
- This is su...
- It's on me. It's on me.

23:24.192 --> 23:27.163
Watch Valerie for me, will you?
I don't want her running off.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.543
- Where are you off to?
- Um,

23:40.676 --> 23:42.278
we have a run-through
at the theater.

23:42.412 --> 23:43.680
Oh, whereabouts?

23:44.180 --> 23:46.716
- Covent Garden.
- Oh, it's the same as me.

23:47.215 --> 23:48.617
Oh.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.555
Tube? Tube.

23:51.922 --> 23:54.758
I'm not really so good on tubes.

23:54.891 --> 23:55.959
I'll look after you.

23:56.992 --> 23:59.895
- Why do you call her Valerie?
- After my first love.

24:00.028 --> 24:02.065
- That's very romantic.
- I wish it was,

24:02.198 --> 24:05.602
she drove me mad.
I was besotted by her.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.337
She played the violin beautifully,
my mom used to make me

24:08.471 --> 24:11.875
practice with her,
but she was cruel and spiteful.

24:11.974 --> 24:14.711
You know, she came around
our house, to tell me and my mom

24:14.844 --> 24:18.114
she had gotten into St. Mark's
and I had failed.

24:18.681 --> 24:20.317
- So she didn't have your back?
- No.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.686
No, she didn't.

24:25.287 --> 24:26.590
What happened to her?

24:26.923 --> 24:28.924
She married an accountant
called Francis,

24:29.057 --> 24:32.596
she got three children and she
regrets being horrible to me.

24:33.296 --> 24:35.030
- How do you know?
- She told me.

24:35.163 --> 24:36.799
She came to a concert
I was playing

24:36.932 --> 24:38.367
in Dublin.
She came around afterwards

24:38.500 --> 24:41.070
to tell me how fantastic
I was and how sorry she was

24:41.203 --> 24:42.806
for being such a shit at 11.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.141
I pretended I couldn't
remember who she was.

24:45.273 --> 24:47.076
That's a bit cruel, Frank.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.944
Yeah, well, it was, but,
you know...

24:49.778 --> 24:51.213
...I thought I was a god.

24:51.314 --> 24:52.682
I was traveling
all over the world

24:52.815 --> 24:54.618
doing concerts
from New York to Moscow.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.852
I was a star.

24:56.419 --> 24:58.622
- What are you now?
- I'm a humble musician

24:58.755 --> 25:00.256
earning a crust.

25:01.390 --> 25:02.325
It's our stop.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.827
Sort of lost, you know.

25:05.361 --> 25:07.230
You know, playing
in an orchestra is one thing,

25:07.363 --> 25:09.732
but being a soloist is another.

25:09.865 --> 25:12.335
I would arrive
in some beautiful city

25:12.468 --> 25:15.038
dribble into the hotel,
practice,

25:15.171 --> 25:17.740
go to the concert hall,
play with an orchestra

25:17.874 --> 25:19.142
I didn't know,
be conducted by someone

25:19.275 --> 25:21.378
I didn't know, do the concert

25:21.510 --> 25:22.979
and I would go back to the hotel

25:23.112 --> 25:26.416
eat something, drink one wine,
go to bed,

25:26.548 --> 25:30.319
wake up, go to the airport
and head off to another city.

25:46.268 --> 25:47.170
You alright?

25:48.503 --> 25:50.205
Jeez, are you okay?

25:50.338 --> 25:52.708
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, shh, shh,

25:52.842 --> 25:54.678
breathe, breathe, it's alright.

25:54.943 --> 25:56.779
It's okay. Oh, shit.

25:56.913 --> 25:58.714
Oh, fuck.

25:58.847 --> 26:00.182
Come here, you, bitch.

26:00.615 --> 26:03.185
Stop!

26:10.459 --> 26:13.730
Hi, you okay? You okay?

26:13.863 --> 26:15.365
- Yeah, is your...
- cello okay?

26:15.464 --> 26:16.799
Oh, yeah, it is a flight case,

26:16.932 --> 26:18.734
it's meant to be
chucked down the stairs.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.903
- Do you want to check it maybe?
- Uh, I'll check it later.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.338
Let's, let's get out of here.
Come on, okay? All right.

26:24.874 --> 26:27.210
I'm sorry.

26:29.511 --> 26:32.281
I'm feeling much better now.
It's alright.

26:34.517 --> 26:37.921
It must have been the stairs.
I just, um, it took my breath away.

26:39.121 --> 26:41.324
Sort of hyperventilating,
I'm sorry.

26:42.290 --> 26:43.960
I thought I was quite fit.

26:44.492 --> 26:46.730
Oh, I almost killed
your first love.

26:46.863 --> 26:48.798
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it should be fine.

26:49.064 --> 26:51.000
Yeah, she did good
to fall down some stairs.

26:51.133 --> 26:52.469
She rules my life.

26:52.602 --> 26:55.772
Listen, I've to get
a move on, but, um,

26:56.506 --> 26:58.307
- are you sure you're going to be okay?
- Yeah.

26:58.441 --> 26:59.509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:59.642 --> 27:00.844
What time
do you finish practicing?

27:00.977 --> 27:02.946
Uh, it's rehearsals. Uh.

27:03.846 --> 27:05.914
Five. It's Saturday. Five.

27:06.048 --> 27:07.884
Do you want to meet
somewhere at six?

27:08.017 --> 27:10.120
I've only got to do the matinee,
so we could, um,

27:10.452 --> 27:12.221
we could have
a drink or something.

27:12.555 --> 27:15.291
Shall we do that? There's a bar
on Frith Street called Vladimir's.

27:15.423 --> 27:16.859
Do you want to meet there?

27:18.124 --> 27:19.162
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

27:21.297 --> 27:22.999
Have a good rehearsal. Yeah?

27:28.837 --> 27:31.307
So it looks
like I'm playing Cordelia.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.410
I know, it's funny.
And the actress who was playing

27:34.542 --> 27:36.779
Cordelia is now playing Regan,
and the other actress

27:36.913 --> 27:39.048
who was playing Regan
is now playing Goneril.

27:40.348 --> 27:41.317
Yeah, no, I am.

27:41.983 --> 27:45.087
And Christ, it's been ages
since I've been in theater.

27:45.221 --> 27:47.856
And the Donmar...
it's a really small space,

27:47.990 --> 27:50.527
but, you know,
and the audience is quite close, I mean.

27:51.894 --> 27:53.797
I know that. Yes.

27:54.329 --> 27:56.865
I'm actually just about to go
for a drink with Frank.

27:57.932 --> 27:59.269
The man from upstairs.

28:00.369 --> 28:03.272
Yeah, I met him today
at the café, the Brunswick.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.376
Yeah, he's really nice and
he's somewhere doing a matinee

28:07.509 --> 28:10.547
at the moment.
He's good-looking.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.548
Caroline, you said you saw him.

28:14.115 --> 28:16.419
Well, you know what?
He had to ask me on the Tube.

28:16.551 --> 28:18.221
Yes, I went on the Tube.

28:20.321 --> 28:21.957
Stop that.

29:16.979 --> 29:18.213
You found me, then.

29:21.383 --> 29:22.285
Yeah.

29:26.087 --> 29:27.257
What would you like?

29:28.691 --> 29:31.361
Um, tea, please.

29:31.493 --> 29:34.029
Have a glass of something,
I can come and join you.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.498
The house white is not bad.

29:35.631 --> 29:37.166
Okay. Thank you.

29:52.580 --> 29:54.082
Everything all right?

29:54.215 --> 29:58.053
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
It's fine now, childcare.

30:04.993 --> 30:06.495
You must be Frank's neighbor.

30:06.863 --> 30:09.265
I'm Natasha,
he said you were coming in.

30:09.397 --> 30:11.667
I told her that you don't
complain about the music.

30:12.468 --> 30:14.470
- Cordelia.
- What would you like?

30:15.037 --> 30:17.240
- A glass of red?
- That would be lovely.

30:19.074 --> 30:20.009
Thank you.

30:28.683 --> 30:31.253
- So, how was your rehearsals?
- Hmm.

30:33.087 --> 30:34.289
It was okay.

30:34.722 --> 30:36.992
The American
kicked off about the rest

30:38.124 --> 30:39.561
of the cast not giving
Lear enough respect.

30:40.061 --> 30:42.431
Bet he just wants people to stand
there and look at him while he talks.

30:42.565 --> 30:45.401
He sounds like a real pain.

30:45.534 --> 30:48.137
He is. He is quite old school.

30:48.269 --> 30:51.173
And the director is about 12,
so he's scared shitless of me.

30:54.742 --> 30:56.678
What...
What are you doing?

30:56.811 --> 30:59.081
- You look fantastic when you're angry.
- Stop.

30:59.214 --> 31:00.582
Wait, let's do a selfie.

31:06.587 --> 31:08.691
- We look good together.
- Frank!

31:08.824 --> 31:10.625
There's a call for you
on the landline.

31:10.759 --> 31:13.096
Shit, uh, might be a minute.

31:31.547 --> 31:33.316
Hello, how are you?

31:33.449 --> 31:35.284
Hi, nice to see you again.

31:47.395 --> 31:48.463
Gin tonic?

31:55.737 --> 31:56.639
Hello?

31:56.771 --> 31:58.307
<i>Cordelia, it's Frank.</i>

31:58.440 --> 32:00.276
- <i>It's so bad. You alright?</i>
- Yeah?

32:00.976 --> 32:04.047
- Um, Frank, are you okay?
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine, yes, yes.</i>

32:04.180 --> 32:07.316
- <i>Can you meet me outside?</i>
- Yes. Sure, I can do that.

32:07.449 --> 32:09.619
<i>At the back entrance...</i>

32:09.951 --> 32:12.087
- <i>And don't forget Valerie.</i>
- What's going... Okay.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.455
<i>Don't forget Valerie, right?</i>

32:13.588 --> 32:14.589
Okay.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.543
I'm so sorry about that.

32:34.676 --> 32:36.311
There is someone I didn't want
to see, and see a friend

32:36.444 --> 32:38.447
gave me a warning call.
Come on. Let's get a cab.

32:38.580 --> 32:40.549
- I'll give you a lift home.
- It's okay, I can cope with the bus...

32:40.682 --> 32:42.218
No, you wouldn't, it's hell,

32:42.351 --> 32:43.686
honestly, and with this,
it's even worse.

32:43.818 --> 32:45.354
Plus, I owe you an explanation.

32:45.487 --> 32:47.256
Come on, you'll be quite safe.
Come on.

32:50.459 --> 32:51.494
Get in.

32:55.631 --> 32:57.233
Hunter Street, please.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.436
- Does that happen often?
- What?

33:00.568 --> 33:04.639
You having to leave buildings
through fire exits.

33:08.844 --> 33:11.814
So what did he want? The person
you were trying to avoid.

33:14.482 --> 33:15.350
Money.

33:16.585 --> 33:18.321
That's why
you're travelling in a taxi.

33:22.290 --> 33:23.625
Oh, have you got my phone?

33:28.529 --> 33:30.465
- Thanks.
- Nice photos.

33:40.442 --> 33:41.344
What do you mean?

33:42.477 --> 33:43.913
You seem to have
a lot of pictures of

33:44.313 --> 33:46.149
my sister and I on your phone.

33:54.957 --> 33:57.627
- Is that you?
- That's my sister.

33:59.228 --> 34:01.430
- Christ.
- Is that all you have say?

34:04.833 --> 34:08.237
Well, it's a new phone,
isn't it?

34:10.438 --> 34:11.473
What does that mean?

34:13.275 --> 34:14.343
Well, I'm just...

34:15.677 --> 34:16.846
I don't know,
I'm trying out the camera

34:16.978 --> 34:18.380
taking pictures out
of the window.

34:26.989 --> 34:27.956
And this?

34:30.891 --> 34:32.327
It's my letterbox.

34:35.831 --> 34:36.798
Why?

34:39.835 --> 34:42.871
- Because I fancy you.
- That's a bit weird.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.807
And who do you fancy,
me or my sister?

34:46.742 --> 34:48.644
You, I fancy you.

34:50.445 --> 34:52.215
I didn't know
there were two of you.

35:07.528 --> 35:08.731
I'll get this.

35:23.445 --> 35:24.947
Suppose me asking
if you'd like a drink

35:25.079 --> 35:26.848
in my place is out
of the question?

35:32.621 --> 35:33.489
Well?

35:34.456 --> 35:36.525
No, I need a little headspace.

35:37.759 --> 35:39.594
Can I give you
some money for the taxi?

35:46.034 --> 35:47.737
I'll play something for you.

36:44.525 --> 36:46.928
- Hello?
- <i>Why did you close the curtains?</i>

36:50.699 --> 36:52.967
Who is this?

36:53.467 --> 36:55.637
<i>I can still just see you
again now.</i>

36:58.739 --> 37:00.575
<i>Is he your new boyfriend?</i>

37:02.110 --> 37:03.679
<i>Is he playing for you?</i>

37:31.940 --> 37:32.942
Are you okay?

37:33.541 --> 37:36.846
He keeps ringing me.
I keep getting these calls.

37:37.846 --> 37:39.414
He keeps ringing. He just rang.

37:39.681 --> 37:42.083
He just rang
and he's watching from outside.

37:42.717 --> 37:45.621
He just rang and, and, and said
that you were my boyfriend

37:45.753 --> 37:48.990
and... that you were playing
for me upstairs.

37:49.123 --> 37:50.792
How would he know
I was playing for you?

37:50.925 --> 37:52.460
Because he must have
seen us just come in.

37:52.594 --> 37:54.096
He's watching from outside.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.398
- I can go and have a look.
- No, no, don't, don't,

37:56.532 --> 37:58.067
don't, don't, don't, please.

37:58.434 --> 38:00.136
I know, look, come with me.

38:00.268 --> 38:02.070
Yeah, you can stand
in my front room.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.806
Listen, you can
stand in my front room.

38:03.938 --> 38:05.875
You can see the street
and I can see you.

38:06.007 --> 38:08.176
Okay? Alright? Come on.

38:10.711 --> 38:11.646
Go, go, go.

38:32.099 --> 38:33.802
I'm going to have a look.
You stay there.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.829
Oh, Mrs. Grotowski.

39:33.961 --> 39:37.233
Where is he? Oh, please,
stop that.

39:37.365 --> 39:39.934
This noise goes on morning,
noon and night.

39:40.068 --> 39:42.505
My husband, he's had a stroke,
he can't sleep.

39:42.637 --> 39:45.507
There is now noise
from dawn to dusk!

39:45.641 --> 39:48.277
Do we have to put up
with this dreadful noise?

39:48.409 --> 39:51.614
It is making him depressed.

39:51.746 --> 39:53.648
How dare you!

40:00.655 --> 40:02.825
Mr. Ryan, how dare you...

40:02.958 --> 40:05.226
What did I do?
It just started playing.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.230
Oh, it's so easy with the practice,
it's a tool for musicians.

40:08.329 --> 40:09.998
It's like a mini
recording device.

40:10.132 --> 40:13.568
Look, the only way
of looking down into your flat

40:13.702 --> 40:17.740
is by stopping and peering
down from the pavement.

40:17.873 --> 40:20.576
I think if that had happened,
I'd have seen him because I was here,

40:20.708 --> 40:22.777
playing. So,

40:22.911 --> 40:25.847
whoever rang just guessed
you were at the window.

40:26.514 --> 40:29.083
He knew I had closed
the curtains.

40:29.483 --> 40:31.186
He said, "Why did you
close the curtains?"

40:31.318 --> 40:32.788
I'll show you.

40:40.061 --> 40:41.130
I came in.

40:42.262 --> 40:43.998
And then I went
into the front room.

40:44.798 --> 40:47.335
- I could hear you, up above.
- What's out there?

40:47.969 --> 40:48.871
Nothing is.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.706
A few yards of wall that goes up
to the pavement.

40:54.909 --> 40:57.746
- And around the back?
- You're scaring me even more now.

40:57.878 --> 41:00.782
Nothing. Uh,
just a yard and two bedrooms

41:00.916 --> 41:03.352
overlooking the yard.
Why are you asking this?

41:04.219 --> 41:06.288
I'm just trying to see
if there's a way to get out.

41:07.755 --> 41:08.757
What do you mean, "out"?

41:22.936 --> 41:24.672
Someone has been in my room.

41:25.306 --> 41:26.909
The doors have all been opened.

41:30.045 --> 41:31.614
Oh, what the fuck is going on?

41:39.086 --> 41:39.989
I'll get it.

42:10.418 --> 42:11.320
What did he say?

42:12.753 --> 42:13.355
Nothing.

42:15.289 --> 42:16.391
I could just hear breathing.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.436
It's okay. Whoa, Okay.

42:28.335 --> 42:33.107
Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Okay, breathe.

42:34.842 --> 42:35.877
Breathe.

42:38.445 --> 42:39.414
Okay.

42:39.815 --> 42:41.817
Look, look! Watch me.

42:42.150 --> 42:43.452
Yeah? Watch me.

42:50.425 --> 42:53.128
Problem solved!
Now it can't ring anymore.

42:53.228 --> 42:55.264
- Shouldn't we call the police?
- And say what?

42:56.264 --> 42:57.900
Y... you had a prank call?

42:58.266 --> 42:59.168
Look.

42:59.934 --> 43:03.105
Someone is trying
to frighten you.

43:04.338 --> 43:05.206
Yeah?

43:05.907 --> 43:06.942
I'm here now.

43:07.942 --> 43:08.976
I'm right above you.

43:09.844 --> 43:10.878
I could help.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.315
I got a spare room.

43:14.481 --> 43:15.884
I need to sort it out a bit.

43:19.521 --> 43:21.990
- Are you in tonight?
- Yes.

43:25.126 --> 43:28.297
I'll stay here. And i...
if I need you, I'll shout.

43:30.164 --> 43:32.835
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, a hundred percent.

43:34.501 --> 43:35.471
Alright.

45:02.123 --> 45:03.157
Hunter!

45:07.195 --> 45:08.197
Hunter?

45:13.233 --> 45:14.235
Hunter!

45:17.005 --> 45:18.039
Hunter.

45:22.510 --> 45:23.412
Hunter?

47:32.806 --> 47:36.377
<i>You were
called today at 9:15 p.m.</i>

47:36.978 --> 47:38.246
<i>The telephone number is</i>

47:38.378 --> 47:44.685
<i>0-7-7-7-6-1-3...</i>

47:53.561 --> 47:57.566
<i>You were
called today at 9:15 p.m.</i>

47:57.898 --> 47:59.233
<i>The telephone number is</i>

47:59.367 --> 48:03.705
<i>0-7-7-7-8-2</i>

48:03.838 --> 48:07.676
<i>1-3-6-0-4.</i>

49:00.527 --> 49:01.429
You're back.

49:04.599 --> 49:06.168
I haven't seen you in ages.

49:09.871 --> 49:11.506
I wish you would talk to me.

49:13.373 --> 49:14.576
You've never talked to me.

49:24.284 --> 49:25.252
Hunter is dead.

49:27.355 --> 49:28.490
He was scared of you.

49:29.289 --> 49:30.257
I'm not.

49:35.730 --> 49:36.731
I'm glad you're back.

49:40.201 --> 49:41.735
I might be able to sleep now.

49:53.648 --> 49:55.517
I'm going to take
a photograph of you.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.188
You never ring back.

50:34.255 --> 50:35.390
I guess you're asleep.

50:37.525 --> 50:39.494
I'm bringing Hunter home
to bury him.

50:40.927 --> 50:44.833
I got the first train
and then a cab from Littleport.

50:46.934 --> 50:47.903
I'll see you soon.

51:48.362 --> 51:49.264
Allain!

52:47.887 --> 52:48.789
Allain.

55:37.724 --> 55:39.626
- Hello?
- <i>I heard you come in.</i>

55:41.027 --> 55:44.465
Yeah, just got in,
I got absolutely soaked.

55:44.798 --> 55:45.867
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

55:47.268 --> 55:49.103
No, I was going to get
my wet things off

55:49.235 --> 55:50.237
to try and get warm.

55:50.570 --> 55:52.706
<i>I got a picnic I can bring down.</i>

55:54.842 --> 55:57.878
Okay, just give me
ten minutes to dry my hair.

55:58.012 --> 55:59.948
<i>I'll come now. You dry your hair</i>

56:00.081 --> 56:02.217
<i>and I'll set out
the picnic in the kitchen.</i>

56:02.617 --> 56:04.018
- Okay.
- <i>Alright.</i>

57:03.309 --> 57:04.278
Had a good day?

57:05.813 --> 57:06.681
Yeah.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.149
I went to visit my stepmother.

57:10.050 --> 57:11.019
What did you do?

57:11.885 --> 57:12.854
This and that.

57:22.963 --> 57:23.865
Oh.

57:25.365 --> 57:26.601
Got any lemons?

57:27.101 --> 57:28.001
No.

57:28.302 --> 57:29.938
I'll grab one from upstairs.

57:30.070 --> 57:32.139
Don't worry. I... I'll leave
the door on the latch.

57:53.860 --> 57:55.295
Stupid fucking light.

57:56.396 --> 57:58.065
I told you to fix that.

57:59.733 --> 58:00.735
Stop!

58:26.226 --> 58:27.327
Weird color.

58:29.829 --> 58:33.735
No, it's nice. You look nice,
you look nice.

58:34.835 --> 58:35.869
Nice.

58:38.706 --> 58:39.407
Hmm.

58:41.875 --> 58:43.010
Everything is fine.

58:48.282 --> 58:49.417
Where the fuck are you?

58:54.487 --> 58:55.756
Still raining.

58:57.023 --> 58:59.027
I nipped to the shops. You okay?

59:00.027 --> 59:01.095
You took forever.

59:01.228 --> 59:02.363
I was getting impatient.

59:03.297 --> 59:04.298
Well, I'm here now.

59:06.032 --> 59:07.168
I'll fix us a drink.

59:29.757 --> 59:30.825
Whiskey or wine?

59:32.092 --> 59:33.461
Trying to get me drunk?

59:36.028 --> 59:37.197
Are you safe, Frank?

59:38.831 --> 59:40.000
Am I safe with you?

1:00:08.494 --> 1:00:09.996
Am I safe with you?

1:00:15.369 --> 1:00:16.504
Your clothes are damp.

1:00:18.972 --> 1:00:19.907
I'm running a bath.

1:00:29.115 --> 1:00:31.152
So where did you study music,
Frank?

1:00:31.284 --> 1:00:33.320
A long time ago,
at the Royal College.

1:00:33.853 --> 1:00:36.490
I went to the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

1:00:38.257 --> 1:00:41.762
I was a good actress,
fucking good actress.

1:00:42.597 --> 1:00:45.800
I won the gold medal,
so it's official.

1:00:47.333 --> 1:00:48.402
I was good.

1:00:50.436 --> 1:00:52.272
Then I got involved
in real life drama

1:00:52.405 --> 1:00:55.208
and RADA seemed useless.

1:00:58.478 --> 1:01:00.081
I couldn't go underground.

1:01:02.615 --> 1:01:03.818
Into the Tube.

1:01:04.918 --> 1:01:08.222
I haven't in over 12 years.

1:01:09.590 --> 1:01:12.425
Until yesterday with you, Frank.

1:01:15.295 --> 1:01:16.998
And what's so strange,

1:01:17.597 --> 1:01:19.567
is that it all happened
below here.

1:01:20.567 --> 1:01:22.135
Below this flat.

1:01:23.103 --> 1:01:24.405
Right below us, Frank.

1:01:28.641 --> 1:01:31.978
It was a Thursday morning,
8:49, Piccadilly Line,

1:01:32.112 --> 1:01:34.282
between Kings Cross
and Russell Square.

1:01:36.550 --> 1:01:37.885
And I survived.

1:01:41.355 --> 1:01:43.891
Rats survive anything,
isn't that what they say, Frank?

1:01:44.423 --> 1:01:46.360
Well,
I survived the bomb on the Tube.

1:01:49.496 --> 1:01:51.164
So, what does that make me?

1:02:00.606 --> 1:02:01.842
How do I look?

1:02:05.579 --> 1:02:07.148
Do you like me
dressed like this?

1:02:11.217 --> 1:02:13.486
The way you dress tells
people something about you.

1:02:17.291 --> 1:02:18.392
I've forgotten that.

1:02:21.929 --> 1:02:23.130
I don't know who I am.

1:02:31.570 --> 1:02:33.440
I know that I want
to fuck you, Frank.

1:02:36.610 --> 1:02:37.912
Just tell you that.

1:02:47.521 --> 1:02:48.522
You look good.

1:02:53.427 --> 1:02:54.996
Do you want to fuck me, Frank?

1:02:56.663 --> 1:02:58.164
It's our first date.

1:02:58.931 --> 1:03:00.901
Do you think we should fuck
on the first date?

1:03:04.036 --> 1:03:05.372
We could fuck on the floor.

1:03:07.306 --> 1:03:08.241
Or in the bath.

1:03:10.577 --> 1:03:12.046
Or in Caroline's bed.

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.347
I don't care.

1:03:15.148 --> 1:03:16.350
I just want you.

1:03:19.353 --> 1:03:20.488
You want me, Frank?

1:03:26.259 --> 1:03:28.094
What the fuck
do you want from me, Frank?

1:03:33.632 --> 1:03:35.201
I want to feel you.

1:03:49.081 --> 1:03:51.085
I see you.

1:03:52.652 --> 1:03:55.722
I know you hide alone
in that flat upstairs.

1:04:00.327 --> 1:04:01.295
Do you think of me?

1:04:03.563 --> 1:04:04.465
Yeah.

1:04:05.664 --> 1:04:06.701
Yeah, I do.

1:04:10.603 --> 1:04:12.339
You're just the same as me.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.442
Half-living.

1:04:19.612 --> 1:04:21.181
I like living alone.

1:04:24.351 --> 1:04:25.987
I need to trust you, Frank.

1:04:28.454 --> 1:04:29.422
What do you mean?

1:04:31.490 --> 1:04:32.726
I want you to play for me.

1:04:41.101 --> 1:04:42.236
Go and get your cello.

1:04:43.335 --> 1:04:44.237
Play for me.

1:04:45.704 --> 1:04:46.606
Do it.

1:10:15.135 --> 1:10:16.403
You didn't believe me.

1:10:20.439 --> 1:10:21.942
I can't play in front of people.

1:10:24.176 --> 1:10:25.845
It's hard for me, you're right.

1:10:45.164 --> 1:10:48.101
You don't just peep through
windows do you, Frank?

1:10:48.234 --> 1:10:52.105
- Cordelia, you don't know wh...
- You are really fucked up, Frank.

1:10:55.475 --> 1:10:56.643
You're the caller, aren't you?

1:10:59.612 --> 1:11:00.748
You're not just some...

1:11:01.614 --> 1:11:04.952
...tragic musical talent
with performance anxiety.

1:11:06.719 --> 1:11:07.788
It's not just that.

1:11:10.789 --> 1:11:13.961
You hide up there
in your flat...

1:11:14.993 --> 1:11:16.095
...watching us.

1:11:18.198 --> 1:11:21.835
I know what it is to be afraid.

1:11:23.770 --> 1:11:25.806
And to feel
that nothing is safe.

1:11:28.541 --> 1:11:30.411
I gave my seat to someone else.

1:11:30.543 --> 1:11:32.779
I'm not meant to be
in the world.

1:11:37.984 --> 1:11:40.921
The floorboards are up, Frank.

1:11:42.689 --> 1:11:46.593
You have been peering at us
through the floorboards.

1:11:48.161 --> 1:11:50.063
What are you on about?

1:11:50.195 --> 1:11:52.432
You've been spying on us.

1:12:02.274 --> 1:12:06.212
I tore up the floor
to catch the rat.

1:12:07.012 --> 1:12:07.914
What?

1:12:08.547 --> 1:12:10.451
They're everywhere, Cordelia.

1:12:10.583 --> 1:12:13.220
You brought the rats up
from the underground with you.

1:12:13.353 --> 1:12:14.587
Just get out.

1:12:15.822 --> 1:12:17.123
I can see right through you.

1:12:19.091 --> 1:12:20.594
We're the same, you and me.

1:12:22.628 --> 1:12:23.697
Just like you said.

1:12:26.265 --> 1:12:27.667
Fuck you, Frank.

1:12:35.574 --> 1:12:38.144
You judge me.
You're just as messed up, huh?

1:12:40.747 --> 1:12:43.517
You don't know
anything about me.

1:12:43.649 --> 1:12:44.585
I played for you.

1:12:45.318 --> 1:12:47.119
I let you see me, really see me,

1:12:47.252 --> 1:12:49.989
and now I should get
something in return, hmm?

1:12:51.791 --> 1:12:54.127
Or is it all games with you,
Cordelia?

1:12:54.260 --> 1:12:56.864
You make me trust you
and then you kick.

1:12:58.698 --> 1:13:00.934
I want you to leave.

1:13:03.936 --> 1:13:05.538
I preferred watching you,
anyway.

1:13:06.605 --> 1:13:08.908
Just... please, leave.

1:13:11.010 --> 1:13:12.512
I wasn't buying
this act for a second.

1:13:12.645 --> 1:13:14.081
You're tortured by guilt.

1:13:32.931 --> 1:13:33.833
Oh, my God!

1:13:34.801 --> 1:13:36.036
What have you done?

1:13:38.203 --> 1:13:39.872
Shouldn't have said that, Frank.

1:13:41.873 --> 1:13:43.644
Because I'm not guilty.

1:13:45.310 --> 1:13:48.581
It's not my fault that I'm here.

1:13:48.715 --> 1:13:50.050
Jesus! Fu...

1:13:51.016 --> 1:13:51.885
Fuck!

1:13:52.618 --> 1:13:53.853
Y... you stabbed me!

1:13:56.956 --> 1:13:57.858
I need...

1:13:58.291 --> 1:13:59.726
Cordelia, I need...

1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.695
I need... I need an ambulance.

1:14:03.261 --> 1:14:05.264
She... I... Fuck!

1:14:07.067 --> 1:14:09.101
I need... I need help, Cordelia.

1:14:09.234 --> 1:14:11.170
You do... you,
you've stabbed me in the chest.

1:14:11.304 --> 1:14:12.806
I need to go to a hospital.

1:14:12.939 --> 1:14:14.041
Fuck, m... my cello.

1:14:15.975 --> 1:14:18.579
Cordelia, please, call 999!

1:14:27.686 --> 1:14:29.756
It's not working, Frank.

1:14:29.889 --> 1:14:31.224
Use your mobile!

1:14:53.712 --> 1:14:54.614
Hello!

1:14:55.247 --> 1:14:56.248
Cordelia Russell.

1:14:57.449 --> 1:15:00.319
2 Asheville House,
Hunter Street.

1:15:02.188 --> 1:15:04.992
I'm with someone who's been
stabbed in the chest.

1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:09.662
Uh, on the right side.

1:15:10.596 --> 1:15:13.332
With a knife, I think.
Yes, he's conscious.

1:15:16.435 --> 1:15:17.336
Um...

1:15:18.237 --> 1:15:19.139
...not a lot.

1:15:20.172 --> 1:15:21.041
No.

1:15:23.510 --> 1:15:25.278
Yes, I can do that.

1:15:27.313 --> 1:15:29.048
Okay, and y...
and you'll stay on the line?

1:15:31.149 --> 1:15:32.051
Okay.

1:15:32.484 --> 1:15:33.386
Thank you.

1:15:34.753 --> 1:15:35.788
They're on the way.

1:15:36.322 --> 1:15:38.091
I'm just going to get
something to keep you warm.

1:15:38.591 --> 1:15:40.927
Stay there and keep going.

1:15:46.998 --> 1:15:47.900
Fuck!

1:15:55.173 --> 1:15:56.443
It's going to be okay.

1:15:57.510 --> 1:15:59.012
I'm going outside
to wait for them.

1:16:00.747 --> 1:16:01.448
Thank you.

1:16:42.154 --> 1:16:43.189
You okay?

1:16:52.297 --> 1:16:55.835
I was born
with my heart on the right.

1:16:59.137 --> 1:17:01.875
I stabbed you
on your right side.

1:17:03.208 --> 1:17:04.243
We aren't the same.

1:17:07.445 --> 1:17:09.448
So, if we were
really the same...

1:17:12.118 --> 1:17:13.019
...you would die.

1:17:19.024 --> 1:17:20.159
That'll be them.

1:17:28.533 --> 1:17:29.435
It's not for us.

1:17:33.104 --> 1:17:34.173
I'll chase it up.

1:18:00.365 --> 1:18:02.068
I think this is yours.

1:18:03.769 --> 1:18:05.539
They said not to pull it out.

1:18:05.671 --> 1:18:08.841
You didn't call
the emergency people, did you?

1:18:08.975 --> 1:18:10.977
They said not to pull it out.

1:18:11.109 --> 1:18:13.579
You didn't bring them!

1:18:15.948 --> 1:18:18.485
Look, I need your help.
I need to get upstairs.

1:18:18.618 --> 1:18:20.587
Please, help.

1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:22.355
I'm losing a lot of blood.

1:18:22.854 --> 1:18:25.024
I'll say this happened
on the street.

1:18:25.158 --> 1:18:26.493
Please, help me.

1:18:29.930 --> 1:18:32.599
Jesus fucking Christ,
I need you to help me!

1:18:32.731 --> 1:18:35.601
I can't breathe properly
and I'm bleeding to death.

1:18:39.238 --> 1:18:40.273
Where are you going?

1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:42.942
What are you doing?

1:18:44.042 --> 1:18:44.944
Help!

1:19:17.944 --> 1:19:19.179
I need to clean you up, Frank.

1:19:20.279 --> 1:19:21.248
You've been stabbed.

1:19:33.158 --> 1:19:34.159
I'll leave you here.

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:36.462
I'll call Caroline.

1:19:36.563 --> 1:19:37.497
She'll know what to do.

1:19:38.130 --> 1:19:40.199
Why don't you call an ambulance?

1:19:40.699 --> 1:19:42.534
How can Caroline help?

1:19:42.868 --> 1:19:44.404
She's my sister, Frank.

1:19:45.203 --> 1:19:47.340
I need to talk
this through with her.

1:20:11.529 --> 1:20:12.431
Hi.

1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:15.702
Sorry to bother you. Um...

1:20:16.502 --> 1:20:17.604
...I know it's late.

1:20:20.739 --> 1:20:23.275
Maybe if you get this message,
you could call me back.

1:20:26.212 --> 1:20:27.514
Apparently we have rats.

1:20:29.748 --> 1:20:31.451
Maybe I told you that already,
though.

1:20:35.354 --> 1:20:36.489
I need to get rid of it.

1:20:41.193 --> 1:20:42.095
Anyway...

1:20:44.195 --> 1:20:45.364
...I love you, sister.

1:21:42.154 --> 1:21:44.457
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1:21:46.125 --> 1:21:49.796
Just... being paranoid as usual.

1:21:51.363 --> 1:21:52.265
Edgy.

1:21:53.431 --> 1:21:54.434
Seeing things.

1:21:58.703 --> 1:22:00.139
No, it's in control now.

1:22:01.774 --> 1:22:02.675
Yeah.

1:22:04.243 --> 1:22:05.145
Frank.

1:22:06.212 --> 1:22:07.147
From upstairs.

1:22:09.414 --> 1:22:10.315
Yeah.

1:22:11.884 --> 1:22:13.252
I really liked him.

1:22:15.287 --> 1:22:16.423
It's funny, I...

1:22:17.689 --> 1:22:19.591
I feel sort of connected to him.

1:22:23.261 --> 1:22:24.264
It's weird.

1:22:26.231 --> 1:22:27.533
I feel quite calm.

1:22:33.238 --> 1:22:34.373
Caroline, don't do that.

1:22:36.442 --> 1:22:37.342
No.

1:22:38.444 --> 1:22:39.712
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:22:45.618 --> 1:22:48.254
I'm fine, I swear I'm fine.

1:22:51.689 --> 1:22:52.625
Have a nice day.

1:22:53.391 --> 1:22:55.260
And I'll see you
when you get back.

1:22:55.860 --> 1:22:56.796
Okay.

1:23:00.733 --> 1:23:01.634
I love you.

1:23:04.936 --> 1:23:05.838
Bye.

1:23:48.413 --> 1:23:49.349
Frank.

1:23:51.951 --> 1:23:52.851
Frank.

1:24:00.326 --> 1:24:01.226
Frank.

1:24:25.684 --> 1:24:26.653
Frank?

1:24:51.510 --> 1:24:52.412
Frank.

1:24:56.515 --> 1:24:57.417
Frank?

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:15.935
Frank?
