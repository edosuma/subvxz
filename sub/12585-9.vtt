WEBVTT

00:33.491 --> 00:34.325
Gentlemen,

00:34.409 --> 00:37.203
do not be alarmed if you
hear any loud noises

00:37.287 --> 00:39.956
coming from my property
over the next few days.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
I'm just blowing stuff up.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.918
Look what I found at the library!

00:44.002 --> 00:46.004
"How to Blow Stuff Up."

00:46.087 --> 00:47.589
You're making a bomb?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.883
Several. I'm engaged in an arms race

00:49.966 --> 00:52.260
with an exterminator in McMaynerberry.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.013
You could get in a lot of
trouble for this, Dale.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.932
I'm pretty sure the government
keeps track of books like that.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.684
At least I hope they do.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.688
You mean Rusty Shackleford
could get in a lot of trouble.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.357
I have a library card
in his name. Shi-shaw!

01:06.649 --> 01:09.527

Are you still pretending to be that guy?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.071
-
It's a victimless crime,

01:11.154 --> 01:12.906
like eating grapes at the supermarket.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.534
Or stealing coupons from
Hank's Sunday newspaper...

01:16.618 --> 01:18.286
Boomhauer.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.999
I want you to all look at the plate

01:23.083 --> 01:24.751
in front of you. What do you see?

01:24.834 --> 01:25.835
Steak!

01:25.919 --> 01:27.670
That's right. Steak.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.049
That's what you eat when you're
a member of Team Sizemore,

01:31.132 --> 01:34.385
the number one Realtor in Heimlich County.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.263
But this month's top sellers
get something more.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.808
They get to eat steak... with me.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.435
Oh, the view must be great from up there.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.395
And this month's lucky diner is...

01:44.479 --> 01:45.480
Peggy Hill!

01:45.563 --> 01:46.856
Candi and Roger!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.817
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.443
Darn it!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.112
Come on, you two!

01:52.195 --> 01:54.239
Bring your steaks on up here.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.950
Ta-ta!

01:59.702 --> 02:01.746
It's easy to be the top salesperson

02:01.830 --> 02:03.248
when you sell Arlen Heights.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.041
Peggy is the real hero

02:05.125 --> 02:07.794
trying to move those houses
in Belcher's Grove.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.420
Don't worry,

02:09.504 --> 02:10.839
you'll get here one day.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.632
One shack at a time.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.300
Oh! Ooh, ouch.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.470
Why do we have to watch

02:17.595 --> 02:18.847
a foreign movie?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.306
If it was any good,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.183
they would've made an American version.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.769
Do you think I am enjoying this? No.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.439
But I need upscale clients
in places like Arlen Heights.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
Wealthy people like culture.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.653
Cultured people watch foreign movies.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.238
Oh, something's happening!

02:38.616 --> 02:39.826
This is ridiculous.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.619
Ridiculous?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.454
Are you kidding, Dad?

02:43.538 --> 02:46.124
Colette is gonna leave Etienne for Claude

02:46.207 --> 02:48.710
because Etienne has malaise.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.336
Malaise!

02:51.171 --> 02:53.548
That guy just sprouted wings.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.759
All right, that's it, Peggy,
I'm gonna have to ask you

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
to relinquish the remote control.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.847
Fine! I'll watch the rest at Minh's.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.641
I bet she likes foreign movies.
She's a foreigner.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.560
To her, it's just a movie.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.896
Dinner was splendid.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.648
I suppose it would be appropriate for
us to reciprocate.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.483
We're having a party this weekend.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.611
We'd love it if you could make it.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.613
Oh, we'll be there!

03:16.905 --> 03:18.823
And then maybe this summer, we come visit

03:18.907 --> 03:20.241
at your beach house on the Gulf.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.826
Of course.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.369
Well, let's set a date!

03:23.453 --> 03:24.996
I get calendar.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.248
Please, do not make this awkward.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.084
I'll get it.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.546
Oh, it's the Wassonasongs.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.423
Of Arlen Heights!

03:35.506 --> 03:37.258
Well, how is life in The Heights?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.802
You know, I'm a Realtor,
are you looking to sell?

03:39.886 --> 03:43.181
Because I just watched
this wonderful French movie.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.557
Actually, Ted and I

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
are thinking about selling our house.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.603
We're having a little party this weekend.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.939
You should come-- we could talk more.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.524
Make sure new guesthouse has big room,

03:53.608 --> 03:56.861
so I can drop off present... Me!

04:01.282 --> 04:04.911
"Set the timer and retreat
to a safe distance."

04:04.994 --> 04:06.204
Okay.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.337
Whew!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.174
Oh, my lucky hat!

04:24.931 --> 04:26.766
My smokes!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.854
Thanks for the ride, Hank.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.690
If I pass out before
we get to the hospital,

04:33.773 --> 04:36.359
tell them my name is Rusty Shackleford.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.361
He's got great insurance, Medicaid.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.781
This is the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.616
You could have lost a finger.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.328
Correction. Rusty Shackleford
could have lost a finger.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.253
Hello. I'm Peggy Hill.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.380
I'm a guest of the Wassonasongs.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.215
You're on the list.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.175
Welcome to Arlen Heights.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.145
Peggy, come on in.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.731
Oh, I'm not trying to pressure you, but

05:14.981 --> 05:17.483
I thought I'd bring
this sign in just in case.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.618
Jackpot!

05:29.203 --> 05:31.998
Hi. Peggy Hill, Sizemore Realty.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.709
Hello. Peggy Hill, Sizemore Realty.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.836
Take your seats, everybody.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.421
The presentation is about to begin.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.797
Presentation?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.716
That's right. All the products you see

05:41.799 --> 05:44.385
in this kitchen are made
by the Cozy Kitchen Company,

05:44.469 --> 05:47.388
and I am your Cozy Kitchen saleslady.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.265
Hey, this is not a party.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.352
-It's an ambush.
-You think if we buy fancy corkscrew,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.437
we'll get invited to beach house?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.023
I know what I'm buying.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.942
A giant spatula to flip this house.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.366
Dale Gribble?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.368
Maybe. Who's asking?

06:08.451 --> 06:10.411
Rusty Shackleford.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.622
-Du... Wha...?
-It's me, Dale.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.499
But... but that's impossible.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.334
Rusty died in third grade.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.086
I didn't die. I moved.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.129
You need to stop using my name, Dale.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
I am not using your name.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.007
And I am not Dale!

06:23.091 --> 06:24.884
Come on, Dale,
you're smoking the same brand

06:24.967 --> 06:26.552
of cigarettes you did in the third grade.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.556
Get off my property, whoever I am!

06:35.812 --> 06:37.688
Ta-da!

06:37.772 --> 06:40.108
Cozy Kitchen makes spaghetti so authentic

06:40.191 --> 06:41.943
you'll say, "Mama mia!"

06:47.281 --> 06:51.077
Now, let's mingle and place orders.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.789
One five-bedroom colonial
with a side of multiple offers?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.293
-Oh...
-Peggy, you're a delight.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.671
But I'm having second
thoughts about moving.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.423
What? You can't.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.925
This is my way into Arlen Heights.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.386
Is it the commission? I'll cut it in half.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.804
Oh, it's not the commission.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.597
These people aren't just my customers,

07:11.681 --> 07:13.057
they've become my friends.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.226
Who will take care of them?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.103
I will. I will take over

07:17.186 --> 07:19.564
as Cozy Kitchen representative for you.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.567
I will sell your house;
I'll even help you pack.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.694
I am a full-service Realtor.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.572
Wow, Peggy, you sure are
making this easy for me.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.199
But I need to talk to Ted first.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.083
It's done. We're free.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.543
Super.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.968
So wait, how is selling kitchen appliances

07:49.051 --> 07:50.928
gonna help you sell houses?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.264
Cozy Kitchen gets me in the door,

07:53.347 --> 07:56.017
then Peggy the Realtor sells the house.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.435
Look at all these free samples.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.853
You see this can opener, Hank?

07:58.936 --> 08:02.607
This is also a door opener.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.736
Wow! A toaster that only cooks hot dogs?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.071
That's not a toaster, Bobby. What is it?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.532
A door opener!

08:11.616 --> 08:12.658
Exactly!

08:12.742 --> 08:14.202
And once I open enough doors,

08:14.285 --> 08:15.828
I will be the top seller

08:15.912 --> 08:18.039
eating steak at Chris's table.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.044
What are you doing here?

08:23.127 --> 08:24.795
You're a long way from Belcher's Grove.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.506
Peggy, I've been wondering, in Belcher's,

08:26.839 --> 08:29.425
do you count a couch on
the roof as a family room?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.428
Sometimes.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.472
But right now, I'm visiting clients.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.812
Ta-ta!

08:43.856 --> 08:44.982
Hi.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.442
I am Peggy Hill,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.986
member of Sizemore Realty, and your new

08:49.070 --> 08:50.488
Cozy Kitchen...

08:50.571 --> 08:52.198
representative.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.409
I'm leaving a free sample and my card.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.591
I... I really need to talk to Dale.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.593
I'm trying to get a small business loan,

09:12.677 --> 09:14.679
but the bank thinks I'm the same guy

09:14.762 --> 09:17.807
who skipped town on a string
of failing alpaca farms.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.059
Well, if we see him,
we'll give him the message.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.811
I want to handle this
like gentlemen, but...

09:21.894 --> 09:23.312
Well, I'm not leaving town

09:23.396 --> 09:24.522
until it's sorted out.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.065
Nice meeting you!

09:28.359 --> 09:30.361
Did you hear that?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.445
He's not leaving.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.657
He's gonna hunt me like an animal

09:34.740 --> 09:36.701
and kill me... like an animal!

09:36.784 --> 09:37.868
I was never here!

09:40.913 --> 09:42.290
Could someone toss me a beer.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.503
Can I help you?

09:47.670 --> 09:50.423
Hey there. I'm Judy Barnes,
Cozy Kitchen Corporate.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.884
I just wanted to stop by
to welcome you in person.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.678
It's fun, isn't it?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.930
Well, I'm not getting
the warmest reaction,

09:58.014 --> 10:00.641
and the free samples didn't
help out as much I expected.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.769
That wasn't a sample kit, silly.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.731
That was your first inventory shipment.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.733
AH, well, potato, po-tah-to.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.234
No. Potato.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.446
You owe us money, lots of money.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.866
You probably don't realize how
threatening you're coming off,

10:16.949 --> 10:18.451
even with the smile.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.202
Peggy, bless your heart.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.414
I don't think you understand
how deep you're in.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.292
I suggest you read your contract.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.129
"No right to arbitration.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.965
Serious financial ramifications."

10:33.049 --> 10:34.925
And it's not just the starter kit!

10:35.009 --> 10:36.927
I also have monthly quotas!

10:37.011 --> 10:38.471
They've got me over a barrel.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.389
This is just like that time I had

10:40.473 --> 10:42.850
to sell all those candy bars for school.

10:42.933 --> 10:46.896
Is there any way you can eat
your way out of this?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.481
I'm afraid not, Bobby.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.316
I need to get those samples back.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.869
Excuse me, the gate isn't working.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.788
We had to change all the codes.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.790
Some saleslady was harassing people.

11:05.873 --> 11:06.791
I see.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.211
You know what that guard shack needs?

11:10.294 --> 11:11.754
A panini maker.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.090
Please exit the Heights.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.979
What's all this?

11:29.063 --> 11:30.314
Next month's product.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.732
Your garage was locked.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.859
I hope you don't mind, we used a crowbar.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.986
But I haven't sold
this month's product yet.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.363
If I were you,

11:37.446 --> 11:39.198
I'd quit arguing and start selling...

11:41.117 --> 11:42.993
because Cozy Kitchen is going
to get their money

11:43.077 --> 11:44.286
one way or the other.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.873
Love your roses!

11:53.462 --> 11:55.131
Oh, hey, shug. What's up?

11:55.214 --> 11:57.383
I came over to apologize.

11:57.466 --> 12:01.053
I have been so busy selling Cozy
Kitchen to Arlen Heights,

12:01.137 --> 12:02.763
I've completely ignored my friends.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.056
Here.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.016
Just circle what you want.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.979
Okay, um...

12:11.605 --> 12:12.690
Oh!

12:12.773 --> 12:14.316
I'll take one of these.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.068
A vegetable peeler?

12:16.152 --> 12:19.697
A $12 vegetable peeler?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.532
Well, I don't need anything else.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.200
Who cares? How about a juicer?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.535
A crepe pan?

12:24.618 --> 12:25.953
Help me out. I'm dying here!

12:26.036 --> 12:27.288
You're hurtin' me, shug.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.442
Oh!

12:56.525 --> 12:57.735
Peggy?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.028
What are you doing?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
I tried calling, but you didn't answer.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.033
Cozy Kitchen is not going so well.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.368
But it's okay,
I have the perfect solution.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.537
Let's get this house on the market, huh?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.706
About the house, Peggy.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.249
It's just, a...

13:12.333 --> 13:13.667
a bad time of year for us...

13:13.751 --> 13:15.002
and, uh...

13:15.085 --> 13:17.671
Oh, for goodness sake, Cindy,
look at her. Just tell her.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.966
You're not planning
to sell the house, are you?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.551
No.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.178
I'm sorry.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.680
I had to get out of my contract
and the only way

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
was to find a replacement.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.975
We did what we had to do.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
We tried to disappear
from the face of the Earth

13:32.186 --> 13:33.729
by holing up at our beach house.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.939
It's on an island!

13:35.022 --> 13:36.565
They still found us.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.942
They have motorboats, Peggy!

13:38.025 --> 13:39.276
Motorboats.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.820
You have no idea

13:40.903 --> 13:42.571
what Cozy Kitchen is capable of.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.697
If you want out,

13:43.781 --> 13:45.115
you have to find a better way

13:45.199 --> 13:46.283
to disappear than we did.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.910
Or find your own patsy.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.082
I'm gonna be
a Cozy Kitchen representative.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.668
Oh, thank you, Aunt Peggy.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.503
I'm gonna wear pink,

13:57.586 --> 13:59.046
and learn to cook and...

13:59.129 --> 14:01.924
and, oh, God! oh, God! I can't believe

14:02.007 --> 14:03.592
I have this great job!

14:03.676 --> 14:04.885
You hear that, baby?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.011
We're gonna be okay!

14:06.095 --> 14:07.304
Stop!

14:07.388 --> 14:08.889
I cannot let you do this.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.600
But you promised.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.143
I... I'm sorry, Luanne.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.395
It's a scam.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.107
I want to sell Cozy Kitchen!

14:21.902 --> 14:23.070
Come on.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.905
One more leprechaun.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.240
Darn it.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
Ow!

14:51.724 --> 14:52.975
Shh!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.188
What are you doing?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.315
Hiding.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.649
And you're blowing my cover!

15:00.816 --> 15:02.443
This is my hedge.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.485
Go find your own.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.653
I was here first.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.488
And Hank deeded this hedge to me.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.407
He didn't want you to
get it in the divorce.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.909
Shh!

15:21.795 --> 15:22.755
Dale?

15:22.838 --> 15:23.672
Who are you...

15:23.797 --> 15:25.132
Stifle, woman.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.842
I think I hear Shackleford's car.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.640
Who's Shackleford?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.475
The man whose identity I stole.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.601
Who are you hiding from?

15:35.684 --> 15:36.727
Cozy Kitchen.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.437
The people who made our vegetable peeler?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.521
That thing's great!

15:45.778 --> 15:49.156
All I wanted was to sell a big house,

15:49.239 --> 15:51.075
get to sit at Chris's little table

15:51.158 --> 15:52.826
and get some respect.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.912
All I wanted was a fall guy,

15:54.995 --> 15:56.664
so I'd never have to take responsibility

15:56.747 --> 15:57.957
for my actions.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.042
They're destroying my realty career.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.835
They're threatening to take everything,

16:01.919 --> 16:03.504
and I can't tell Hank about it.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.964
I don't know where to turn.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.048
Me neither.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.508
There's no escape!

16:07.591 --> 16:09.718
Maybe if I killed myself
he'd leave me alone.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.929
While you're at it, take me out, too.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.431
Peggy, it would be my pleasure.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.476
A murder/suicide pact.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.144
That might work.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.147
If Shackleford and Cozy Kitchen
think we're dead,

16:22.231 --> 16:23.941
they'll stop looking for us.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.734
Let's do it.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.194
I'll pretend to kill you

16:27.277 --> 16:29.029
and then pretend to take my own life.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.447
Pretend?

16:30.531 --> 16:32.533
Ah, well, I guess I'm still in.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.578
Okay, here's the story.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.372
We stole Bill's car.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.581
That part's true.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.458
Then we drove it into the ravine.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.918
And you think that's really going

16:43.002 --> 16:44.378
to convince people we're dead?

16:44.461 --> 16:45.671
How hard can it be?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.297
Shackleford convinced me he was dead

16:47.381 --> 16:48.507
in the third grade.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.765
It appears Bill

16:56.849 --> 16:58.600
needs to have his tires aligned.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.103
Run!

17:05.357 --> 17:06.400
Hmm.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.530
Well, Bill's gonna need a new seat.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.285
After we throw the dummies into the water,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.454
we leave a suicide note on the railing.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.622
The swift current will tear
the dummies apart,

17:20.706 --> 17:22.583
and the cops won't find a thing.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.835
Well, then why throw the dummies
in the first place?

17:24.918 --> 17:25.919
Who would even know?

17:26.003 --> 17:26.837
We'd know.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.173
Show a little pride, Peggy.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.219
Oh, Hank. You're home early.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.846
Huh? No, I'm not.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.765
What's going on with those dummies?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.224
Maybe this is good.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.101
We could use a witness to our fake deaths.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.352
To your what?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.229
Did I not mention this to you?

17:45.481 --> 17:48.150
What the hell were you thinking?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.027
I was out of options, Hank.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.863
I couldn't sell a house to cover
the cost of the pots and pans.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.782
If you have any better ideas

17:54.865 --> 17:57.409
than murder-suicide
I would love to hear them.

17:57.493 --> 18:01.163
Well, why don't you throw one
of those parties like Cindy did?

18:01.246 --> 18:02.790
Yes! That's good!

18:02.873 --> 18:05.209
Then I could find a patsy
that I'm not related to!

18:05.292 --> 18:07.294
No! Then you could at least prove

18:07.377 --> 18:09.922
to this Judy woman
that you're trying your best.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.632
And then Judy could tell corporate

18:11.715 --> 18:13.342
what she sees at the party.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.760
This could work, Hank.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.640
Judy,

18:19.723 --> 18:21.892
I'm so glad you could make it.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.144
I presume you have a check for me.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.396
We'll talk after my presentation.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.775
Coming.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.154
Ha-ha!

18:34.238 --> 18:36.406
You'll never catch me, Shackleford!

18:38.909 --> 18:42.538
And thanks to my Cozy Kitchen
non-stick frying pan,

18:42.663 --> 18:43.997
$49.99,

18:44.081 --> 18:45.791
my eggs slide onto the plate.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.086
Help!

18:49.169 --> 18:50.546
You gotta hide me!

18:50.629 --> 18:52.798
Shackleford is on his way.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.424
Dale, if you are not here

18:54.508 --> 18:56.927
to make a purchase,
I must ask you to leave.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.055
Ah, then I am taking you as my hostage.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.140
-Ha!
-No!

19:02.432 --> 19:03.642
Oh, Lord.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.018
-Aah!
-Oh!

19:05.102 --> 19:06.186
-Aah!
-Stop it!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.229
Let go!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.564
-No!
-Dale!

19:13.610 --> 19:16.697
That does it, Dale, I will kill you!

19:16.780 --> 19:19.867
If you kill me, I'm taking you with me!

19:19.950 --> 19:20.951
Oh, no you won't!

19:21.034 --> 19:21.994
Yeah!

19:23.871 --> 19:26.206
-No, stop!
-Shi-shaw!

19:36.550 --> 19:39.178
What the heck is going on?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.471
We still have a chance.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.599
Act like a ghost.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.980
Huh! Wow!

19:50.063 --> 19:51.732
This pan's amazing.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.692
I'm riddled with tiny shrapnel,

19:53.775 --> 19:55.527
but it doesn't have a scratch on it.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.737
Ooh. Hmm.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.322
I could make one hell of a flapjack

19:58.405 --> 19:59.781
with that, honey.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.910
Yep, Cozy Kitchen makes a quality product,

20:02.993 --> 20:04.119
I tell you what.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.496
If it can survive an explosion

20:06.580 --> 20:08.040
imagine how it will stand up

20:08.123 --> 20:10.042
to the demands of the modern kitchen.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.210
I'll take one.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.836
Yeah, lemme have one of those bad boys.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.797
Yeah, me, too.
Do they come in other sizes? Yeah!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.591
If I sell my entire inventory today

20:17.674 --> 20:20.177
will you please let me out of my contract?

20:20.260 --> 20:21.553
No.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.722
I'm never getting out, am I?

20:23.805 --> 20:25.849
There might be one way.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.519
If corporate thinks I died
in the explosion, too.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.396
Consider it done.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.067
We need to settle this

20:35.150 --> 20:37.194
whole identity theft issue
once and for all.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.071
Oh, God! A gun!

20:39.154 --> 20:40.614
Die like a man, Gribble.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.282
Die like a man.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.450
Just sign these forms

20:43.533 --> 20:44.701
so I can get on with my life.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.292
Okay.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.877
You know, Judy,

20:53.961 --> 20:56.255
you're going to need
to disappear for a while.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.173
I know the perfect hideaway,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.592
a sunny two-bedroom in Arlen Heights.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.635
Really?

21:01.718 --> 21:03.095
Mm-hmm. Call me.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.388
We'll set up a tour.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.730
The view really is beautiful from up here.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.521
<i>They have motorboats, Peggy.</i>

21:54.604 --> 21:55.939
<i>Motorboats.</i>
