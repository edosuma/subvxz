Nick, I'm trying to tell you
we have a ghost.

According to this,
our firehouse is haunted

01:58.917 --> 02:02.041

a volunteer fireman...

02:18.125 --> 02:21.458
Actually, at the Ghost Outlet.
Check out the ghost cam.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.458
If there's a ghost in this room,
this camera will detect it.

Dude, that's just a regular video camera.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.375

that this firehouse isn't haunted?

03:01.583 --> 03:03.709
What? What happened?
Did you see the ghost?

03:04.583 --> 03:06.125
What do you mean, the ghost?

03:06.792 --> 03:10.667
Uh, Frankie, why don't you go online
and get us our movie tickets?

03:10.750 --> 03:13.000
Sure, Dad.
Boo!

03:15.709 --> 03:17.583
OK, look, when we bought this firehouse,

03:17.667 --> 03:21.458
there was this legend
of some ghost that haunted the place.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.583
[Kevin]
I knew it!

03:23.667 --> 03:25.834
Dad, why didn't you ever tell us?

Well, there's...
there's no such thing as ghosts.

condemn our souls for eternity

03:33.291 --> 03:34.166
if I told on him.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.750
[Kevin] Dad, it's OK to be frightened.
Look at me.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.166
I'm scared speechless.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.083
But I'm still going to prove
that this place is haunted

03:40.166 --> 03:42.458
with the help of the mighty ghost cam.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.417
Isn't that just a regular video camera?

Apparently, it's got some type
of ghost sticker on it.

Let's keep looking.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.542
We'll do a detailed analysis
of Nick's desk

04:27.625 --> 04:29.792
and check for ghost droppings.

-Get out of my face, please.
-[Kevin] All clear.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.542
There must be a ghost here.

There's no way Joe could lift
all that weight by himself.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.959

04:48.041 --> 04:51.208
What kind of lame ghost would knock?

04:51.291 --> 04:55.417
Maybe he was raised right...
when he was alive.

Hey, guys. Hey, have you heard
of this awesome new thing

05:08.750 --> 05:11.125
that when someone, like,
knocks on the door, you answer it?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.083
Sorry. We're hunting for ghosts.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.875
Oh, I know. Kevin called me
and told me all about

05:15.959 --> 05:18.375
the ghost of Volunteer Fireman
William Smith.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.333
So, I decided to do a little research,

05:20.417 --> 05:22.750

There's no such thing as ghosts.

Au contraire.

that the ghost of Fireman Smith
will return to this firehouse

05:38.083 --> 05:41.750

which is tonight.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.667
I can hardly watch.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.834
Ghost-tracker v-log.
Nick's been ghost-napped.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.083
I don't know if the others
made it back to the safe zone.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.667
I haven't heard anything,
so I must assume that they're dead.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.917
Our of respect for Joe,
I won't start selling his stuff

11:01.000 --> 11:03.667
-until tomorrow.
-[Joe] I can hear you.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.917
Joe's alive!
Out of respect for Stella,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.291
I won't start
selling her stuff until tom--

11:07.375 --> 11:09.000
[Stella]
I'm here...

11:09.750 --> 11:12.083
And so is your leftover pizza.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.291
-[growls]
-[Stella screams]

11:14.375 --> 11:16.000
[yells]

11:16.083 --> 11:19.750
Oh, sorry, guys.
I just found this awesome werewolf mask

11:19.834 --> 11:21.125
and I had to put it on.

11:21.208 --> 11:24.000
And you felt compelled to put it on now?

11:24.083 --> 11:26.125
I wanted to cut the tension.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.250
Plus, my face was kind of cold.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.917
I told you, didn't I?
I told you this firehouse was haunted.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.917
Now Nick's gone and I'm scared.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.917
[whimpering]
Terribly, horribly scared.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.917
Dude, you're freaking us out.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.041
[Kevin]
I'm freaking you out?

11:43.125 --> 11:45.917
Ha! Which one of us
just put a werewolf mask on?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.917
Tension cutter.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
You guys, you guys, the book says
if we don't find Nick by midnight,

11:51.083 --> 11:53.041
-he's gonna be gone forever.
-What?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.166
OK, I distinctly remember
mentioning that part,

11:55.250 --> 11:57.667
so don't get all,
"Oh, why didn't you tell us?" On me.

11:57.750 --> 12:01.750
OK, so what can we do to lure the ghost
of Fireman Smith

12:01.875 --> 12:04.834
out into the open?
Any ideas?

12:04.917 --> 12:08.834
-I mean, what do you lure a ghost with?
-Breadcrumbs.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.208
[Kevin] Those are for pigeons!

12:10.291 --> 12:12.375
-Ooh, milk and cookies?
-[Kevin] Those are for Santa.

12:13.083 --> 12:17.208
Oh, the book said
he loved chili and plaid socks!

12:17.917 --> 12:20.166
Where does your mom keep all the chili?
What's this?

12:20.250 --> 12:22.959
I don't know.
What time is it?

12:23.041 --> 12:29.000
-[Kevin] It's two minutes past 12.
-Two minutes past 12? Nick!

12:29.083 --> 12:31.166
[Kevin]
Oh, wait, I set my watch 11 minutes fast

12:31.250 --> 12:34.500
-so I wouldn't be late for school.
-Kevin!

12:34.583 --> 12:37.375
OK, so it's 11:51.
We're running out of time.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.333
Where's all the chili?

12:39.417 --> 12:41.458
[device beeps]
<i>The chili is in the closet behind you.</i>

12:41.542 --> 12:43.083
-[Kevin] Joe, come here, take the camera.
-OK.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.458
-You go check the closet.
-[Kevin] OK.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.542
Ha, thank you.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.750
Oh, that... that... that was...

12:54.834 --> 12:57.041
[panting]

12:59.458 --> 13:01.166
[screams]

13:01.959 --> 13:03.625
That's what I was trying to say.

13:03.709 --> 13:06.667
-[Joe] What is it?
-We have a skeleton in our closet!

13:06.750 --> 13:08.917
[Joe] Well, all families have things
they'd rather keep private.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.125
No.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.792
[Joe] It's the volunteer skeleton
of Fireman Smith!

13:15.875 --> 13:18.458
[both scream]

13:22.166 --> 13:25.125
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

13:25.208 --> 13:26.083
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What? What?

13:26.166 --> 13:28.083
Mom said no running on the stairs.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.291
[Joe]
You're worried about that now?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.709
Who are you more afraid of?
The ghost or Mom?

13:31.792 --> 13:34.041
-It's a good point.
-Yeah.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.542
Run!

13:38.959 --> 13:41.125
Shut the door behind you!

13:41.208 --> 13:43.166
-[yells]
-[Joe] Open it!

13:43.250 --> 13:44.834
-We can't get out!
-Oh, no!

13:44.917 --> 13:46.250
We can't get out.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.959
Oh, oh!

13:49.000 --> 13:50.667
[Joe]
What do you think that giant shadow was?

13:50.750 --> 13:52.208
It was a ghost monster.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.041
That wasn't from research.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.333
I just think that was from
my gut instinct.

13:56.417 --> 13:58.834
Well, do you think he
can get us in here?

13:58.917 --> 14:00.834
I don't know. I think we
might have to live here forever.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.792
I choose that corner.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.083
Whoa, I'm not living in here.
Joe's deodorant is already wearing off.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.083
[Joe] It was designed to keep me
as fresh as a tropical lagoon

14:09.166 --> 14:10.959
while being chased by girls,
not by ghosts.

14:12.542 --> 14:17.166
OK. Well, one of us has to go out there
and see if the coast is clear.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.250
-Not it!
-[Joe] Not it!

14:18.333 --> 14:20.959
Not it.
I guess I'm going.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.917
OK. Well, wait.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
First, I don't want the ghost
to get your mortal body,

14:27.083 --> 14:31.041
so tie this around your waist
and if you need help, just pull on it.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.500
We'll reel you back in.
Good? Good?

14:33.583 --> 14:34.917
Are you sure we can't play
another game of "Not It"?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.250
-Not it.
-[Joe] Not it!

14:36.333 --> 14:38.166
There's got to be a trick to that game.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.333
-Here we go.
-Good luck.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.333
[door creaks]

14:43.417 --> 14:44.959
I need slack.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.542
Stella.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.000
-Everything seems to be--
-[growling]

14:51.083 --> 14:54.542
[yells]
Oh! Reel me in! Reel me in!

14:54.625 --> 14:56.959
-That's not the signal we agreed on.
-Reel me in, Stella!

14:58.125 --> 14:59.709
What are you watching me for?

14:59.792 --> 15:01.583
The scary stuff's over there.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.291
Oh, my gosh.
That was so scary.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.875
I didn't think I was going to make it.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.333
[yells]

15:08.417 --> 15:10.500
I was having a flashback.
I'm sorry.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.750
-[growling]
-[yells]

15:12.834 --> 15:14.083
[screams]

15:14.166 --> 15:15.667
[rock music playing]

15:23.959 --> 15:25.792
Run!

15:25.875 --> 15:27.917
Whoa!

15:28.000 --> 15:30.041
[both screaming]

15:33.875 --> 15:35.125
[both scream]

15:39.792 --> 15:41.000
[both scream]

15:41.083 --> 15:42.792
Run, run, run, run!

15:45.792 --> 15:47.542
[both scream]

15:48.250 --> 15:52.041
OK, that is the fastest-moving skeleton
I have ever seen in my life.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.792
Let's go to the safe zone.
Safe zone!

15:56.375 --> 15:58.250
OK, I made it back.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.291
Because it's too dangerous
to go downstairs,

16:00.375 --> 16:02.041
I'm going to assume I'm the only survivor.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.750
-[Kevin] I made it!
-Good, you're alive.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.583
-Yeah.
-OK, did the girl make it?

16:05.667 --> 16:08.500
Yes.
And I'm alive.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.500
-Did you bring the chili?
-Check.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.792
-What time is it?
-We're too late.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.750
For school or Nick's soul?

16:15.917 --> 16:17.709
Oh, it's five to 12.
We still have some time.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.333
-Good, good.
-Yeah.

16:19.417 --> 16:23.166
OK, so one of us has to
lure the ghost out with the chili.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.417
-Not it.
-Not it.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.166
Oh, man.
I guess I'm it.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.792
[rock music playing]

16:40.375 --> 16:44.041
Volunteer Fireman William Smith,
if you're here, give us a sign.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.542
-[blenders whirring]
-[yells]

16:45.625 --> 16:47.500
[Kevin]
He's making spooky smoothies!

16:48.250 --> 16:51.667
It's two minutes until midnight.
Somebody has to ask him where Nick is.

16:51.750 --> 16:52.750
-Not it.
-[Joe] Not it.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.917
Oh, come on.
[sighs]

16:55.000 --> 16:58.208
-[low voice] Stop.
-[screams]

16:58.291 --> 17:00.625
[voice] Stop screaming!

17:00.709 --> 17:02.625
Now put your guitar down.

17:02.709 --> 17:04.458
[whispering]
I don't have a guitar.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.208
[voice] Kevin, put your guitar down.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.625
What do you want from me?

17:08.709 --> 17:11.417
Hurry up. I have a body to inhabit.

17:12.417 --> 17:16.500
I, uh...
I want my brother back!

17:16.583 --> 17:18.667
[voice] You dare make demands
of a spirit without assuming

17:18.750 --> 17:20.709
the proper position of respect?

17:20.792 --> 17:23.709
-What position?
-[voice] Raise your right arm.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.542
Now extend your left hand.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.291
Lift your right foot behind you.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.083
Now this part is crucial:

17:30.166 --> 17:33.542
spin your mortal body
seven times while hopping.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.750
You know,
that voice kind of sounds like...

17:37.667 --> 17:39.291
Nick.
[yells]

17:39.375 --> 17:41.208
[low voice]
There is no more Nick.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.458
There is only Volunteer Fireman Smith.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.208
[Stella]
We're too late!

17:45.291 --> 17:46.792
The ghost took over Nick's body!

17:46.875 --> 17:51.000
And now Nick is gone forever!

17:51.750 --> 17:54.750
That's right, Nick is mine now.

17:54.834 --> 17:57.208
And I will...
[snorts]

17:57.291 --> 17:59.375
I'm sorry, I can't help but laugh.

17:59.458 --> 18:02.792
Nick, is that you?
And will somebody please give me a bucket?

18:02.875 --> 18:04.333
[laughing]

18:04.417 --> 18:06.208
Heh... Hmm.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.709
Of course, it's me.
And would you please stop that?

18:08.792 --> 18:11.250
-[groans]
-I'm over here.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.625
Oh.
[groans]

18:12.709 --> 18:15.875
We got so tired of hearing about
the firehouse being haunted,

18:15.959 --> 18:18.291
we decided to teach you a lesson.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.875
There's no such thing as ghosts.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.917
That's exactly what a ghost would say.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.667
I know. If I can put my hand
through you, you're a ghost.

18:26.458 --> 18:27.375
Ow.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.583
I can't believe you would do this to me.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.709
Yeah. Are you kidding?
This was all some big joke?

18:32.792 --> 18:34.375
I can't believe you guys
would put us through that.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.625
-Nice try, Stella.
-She was in on it too, Kevin.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.750
I was the screamer.
I was pretty good, huh?

18:42.959 --> 18:47.291
I don't know what to say, except...

18:47.959 --> 18:49.166
That was awesome!

18:49.417 --> 18:53.375
I can't believe it!
You did all that just to scare me?

18:53.458 --> 18:56.250
Aw, guys, thank you.
That means you really care.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.458
-OK.
-All right, we'll take it.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.000
[low maniacal laughter]

19:01.083 --> 19:04.083
Ha! That's OK, guys.
You can cut it out now.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.875
-That wasn't me.
-Wasn't me.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.333
Well, I'm the terrified screamer,
not the menacing laugher.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.917
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you
and it wasn't you,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.667
and it wasn't me, then who?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.667
[loud maniacal laughter]

19:18.750 --> 19:20.667
[all scream]

19:26.792 --> 19:29.333
[distorted laughter]

19:29.417 --> 19:30.959
[all screaming]

19:31.083 --> 19:34.917
You're right, Franks, this was
a lot more fun than going to the movies.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Thanks for the props, Pops.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.083
[rock music plays]

19:48.792 --> 19:50.875
Welcome back, boils and ghouls.

19:50.959 --> 19:55.208
We hope our little story
didn't put you into intensive "scare"!

19:55.291 --> 19:58.166
[laughing maniacally]

19:58.250 --> 20:00.375
-Dude, that's my thing.
-Says who?

20:00.458 --> 20:02.125
You don't even do
the scary laugh right.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.959
Yeah, I do.
[laughing maniacally]

20:06.041 --> 20:08.875
No, it's like this...
[laughing maniacally]

20:08.959 --> 20:12.792
No, Kevin, it's not.
It's... [laughing maniacally]

20:12.875 --> 20:15.667
No.
[laughing maniacally]

20:15.750 --> 20:18.333
[both continue laughing]

20:20.083 --> 20:21.709
[loud maniacal laughter]

20:21.792 --> 20:23.959
[both scream]

20:27.959 --> 20:30.041
[exhales]
Those guys are so easy.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.792
We know there's no such thing as ghosts.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.875
Good night and be safe.

20:37.375 --> 20:40.250
[loud maniacal laughter]

<i>Ooh, chili.</i>

20:42.041 --> 20:44.041
[slurping]

20:46.583 --> 20:50.083
No, this book has all the...
Oh, sorry.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.875
[buzzing]

20:54.458 --> 20:56.375
All the...
If anything ever...

20:56.625 --> 21:01.291
-I can't even concentrate. Oh, my gosh.
-[crew laughing]

21:01.875 --> 21:03.166

Action.

21:03.208 --> 21:06.166
Oh, no!
I think I wet myself.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.458
[crew laughing]

21:09.959 --> 21:13.291
[laughs]
I just did that... [mumbles]

21:15.125 --> 21:18.458
Here's one:
"What's a mummy's favorite type of music?"

21:18.542 --> 21:21.709
"Wrap!"
[laughs]

21:21.792 --> 21:24.083
[sighs]
I know.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.709
Oh, thank you for my tea...

21:28.500 --> 21:31.417
Frankie-stein!
[laughs]

21:32.125 --> 21:36.542
