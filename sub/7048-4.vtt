WEBVTT

00:32.837 --> 00:34.248
Looks like we got company.

00:39.802 --> 00:41.961
Loretta McCready.
What brings you up this way?

00:42.472 --> 00:44.180
Might ask you the same question.

00:44.349 --> 00:47.468
Raylan, what's this all about?
Come up for a little Sunday dinner?

00:47.769 --> 00:50.057
- Well, you know how the job is, Doyle.
- Yeah.

00:50.188 --> 00:52.726
Nights and weekends is when
all the good stuff happens.

00:52.857 --> 00:54.268
Task force never rests.

00:54.484 --> 00:55.480
Task force?

00:56.069 --> 00:57.314
What, they didn't...

00:59.155 --> 01:01.361
Well, I'm sure
they'll be contacting you directly.

01:01.741 --> 01:03.983
Well, task force or no,
you're stepping outside yourself,

01:04.117 --> 01:05.661
showing up at my family home,
aren't you?

01:05.787 --> 01:09.737
Raylan Givens. Uninvited
don't mean unwelcome, Doyle.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.041
You missed lunch. Can I fix you a plate?

01:12.168 --> 01:15.039
Oh, no, I'm fine.
But I did bring you something.

01:17.173 --> 01:18.169
Apple pie.

01:18.299 --> 01:20.256
Of course, it don't compare
to your home brew.

01:20.385 --> 01:23.919
Be a new batch soon. I'll set you
back a jar with your name on it.

01:24.055 --> 01:25.051
I appreciate that.

01:25.181 --> 01:28.135
I also got some things here
for the kids, if it's all right.

01:29.435 --> 01:32.685
Come here, guys.
Marshals Service is big on trinkets.

01:33.273 --> 01:35.514
Go ahead and take one. There you go.

01:37.819 --> 01:41.519
And that there is eastern Kentucky's
official Marshal's coin.

01:42.782 --> 01:43.861
How much is it worth?

01:43.992 --> 01:45.865
It's not for spending, just collecting.

01:46.744 --> 01:48.239
"Justice is coming."

01:49.580 --> 01:52.866
Doyle, you take Loretta on,
and you entertain the kids.

01:53.167 --> 01:54.827
Grown-ups need to chew the fat here.

01:55.211 --> 01:56.207
Go on now.

01:56.337 --> 01:57.713
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go on, all of you.

01:58.423 --> 01:59.751
You, too, Doyle.

02:01.592 --> 02:03.384
Way she tells it, you saved her life.

02:03.803 --> 02:06.887
Well, looks like there's a lot of us
looking after her these days.

02:07.140 --> 02:09.382
What's that they say? Takes a village?

02:09.517 --> 02:12.553
Something like that.
Might we have a word, Mags?

02:24.782 --> 02:27.700
- Of course, you're all welcome to listen.
- Don't mind them.

02:29.495 --> 02:30.491
What's on your mind?

02:30.955 --> 02:33.826
Wondering if you know of a man
name of Bobby Lawton.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.990
Bobby Lawton.
Name doesn't ring a bell.

02:37.211 --> 02:40.248
Fella got killed on that Oxy bus
a few days back.

02:40.715 --> 02:43.835
Turns out he was a foot soldier
for the Dixie Mafia out of Frankfort.

02:44.052 --> 02:48.714
Dixie Mafia? Lord! That sounds
like a mighty dangerous outfit.

02:48.973 --> 02:51.096
They've been known to be, yeah.

02:51.351 --> 02:55.182
Such that hitting their drug pipeline
ain't something we imagine

02:55.313 --> 02:59.013
that these hijackers would have
undertaken on their own initiative.

02:59.484 --> 03:03.731
I believe your boy Doyle
inquired as to who they worked for.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.188
Yeah, I asked them.
They drew down on me.

03:06.449 --> 03:08.857
Right.
Had no choice but to put them down.

03:09.035 --> 03:10.031
That's about right.

03:10.328 --> 03:12.653
Well, one of the hijackers,

03:12.872 --> 03:15.790
name Elrod Platt,
we got his cell phone records.

03:16.250 --> 03:20.544
Week before the hijacking show he had
numerous conversations with Dickie.

03:25.343 --> 03:27.335
Yes, he did speak to Dickie.

03:27.470 --> 03:31.088
I spoke to Elrod about
buying an ATV for the business.

03:32.308 --> 03:34.633
We may never be able
to prove otherwise.

03:34.977 --> 03:38.429
But I want you to know that I know
what's going on, out of respect.

03:42.693 --> 03:43.689
Mama,

03:44.278 --> 03:45.689
- I swear...
- Shut it!

03:52.662 --> 03:53.658
Marshal,

03:55.373 --> 03:56.832
you know I deal a little weed.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.868
And man of your age, you can't tell me
you hadn't smoked a little reefer.

04:02.630 --> 04:03.626
I can't.

04:04.006 --> 04:07.375
And you know my position
on Oxy and meth and the rest.

04:07.510 --> 04:08.885
As you've stated it, yes, ma'am.

04:09.011 --> 04:13.673
And yet you find it acceptable to come in
here and bust in on my family dinner,

04:13.808 --> 04:17.507
asking if I've had a hand in
robbing a bus full of shit

04:17.644 --> 04:19.471
from a bunch of Frankfort peckerwoods.

04:19.605 --> 04:22.310
Mags, I never asked if
you robbed that bus.

04:22.650 --> 04:27.312
No, no, no. You're just being all
clever, insinuating without asking.

04:28.281 --> 04:30.357
Trying to stir things up. That it?

04:31.033 --> 04:33.904
You tell me, Mags. Is it working?

04:34.662 --> 04:36.904
- Let me ask you something, Raylan.
- Fire away.

04:37.290 --> 04:39.532
- Why do you care so much?
- I'm sorry?

04:39.751 --> 04:40.865
Come on, now, child.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.119
Gonna sit there on my
lumber and tell me

04:43.254 --> 04:46.006
this has got nothing to do with
the history between our families?

04:46.299 --> 04:49.833
With why my boy there hasn't
walked right for the past 21 years?

04:51.888 --> 04:55.932
Frankfort mob gonna come over that hill
bringing hell with them because of that bus.

04:56.768 --> 04:59.685
They'll stay till they've
bled this county white.

05:00.771 --> 05:05.149
Whatever our family history, Mags...
That's why I care.

05:09.530 --> 05:10.941
Sure I can't fix you a plate?

05:11.115 --> 05:13.191
- No, thank you.
- How about some dessert?

05:13.701 --> 05:14.732
Nice of you to offer.

05:16.913 --> 05:18.905
You all enjoy the rest of your supper.

05:25.796 --> 05:27.754
Why didn't you tell me?

05:29.467 --> 05:30.498
I had nothing to do with it.

05:31.511 --> 05:35.259
Other than shooting a couple of
assholes to keep them from talking!

05:35.765 --> 05:37.176
Yeah, well, that.

05:37.767 --> 05:40.472
Look, I thought this was a good deal.
I did.

05:40.603 --> 05:43.390
And I know how you feel about Oxy,
but the thing is...

05:43.523 --> 05:44.803
I don't give a shit what you think!

05:46.567 --> 05:49.901
What I do give a shit about
are our bigger plans,

05:51.155 --> 05:55.069
which do not need a federal
marshal snooping around!

05:58.788 --> 05:59.784
So...

06:01.707 --> 06:04.542
What are we gonna do
about Raylan Givens?

06:07.755 --> 06:08.751
What do you mean?

06:10.132 --> 06:12.802
What... What do I mean?

06:13.886 --> 06:15.546
I think she wants us to kill him.

06:16.556 --> 06:18.844
- Have you not been listening?
- Yeah.

06:20.601 --> 06:22.309
She said she didn't want him
snooping around.

06:23.104 --> 06:24.135
That's right.

06:25.314 --> 06:27.556
You have any idea the
federal shit storm

06:27.859 --> 06:30.610
we'd bring down if we killed a marshal?

06:30.987 --> 06:33.312
We're talking Black
Hawk-helicopter time.

06:34.865 --> 06:35.945
Jesus.

06:38.202 --> 06:40.444
I don't want either
of you two doing shit

06:41.330 --> 06:43.702
or even contemplating doing shit

06:44.375 --> 06:47.993
until you run it by
someone who can think.

07:48.356 --> 07:49.351
It's open.

07:53.861 --> 07:55.024
Is the music too loud?

07:55.154 --> 07:56.233
Little bit.

08:01.202 --> 08:02.233
What are you reading?

08:04.538 --> 08:05.949
<i>Of Human Bondage.</i>

08:08.084 --> 08:11.120
- I don't know that.
- Yeah, I just started.

08:15.925 --> 08:17.170
Little stuffy in here.

08:18.427 --> 08:19.590
I don't mind.

08:21.389 --> 08:23.097
It's nicer out on the porch.

08:29.563 --> 08:30.974
Wigs are popular again.

08:31.774 --> 08:33.316
Starting to cut into business,

08:34.568 --> 08:36.691
although there was
this one woman yesterday.

08:36.861 --> 08:38.736
She wanted me to add curls to hers.

08:39.155 --> 08:43.106
She brought it in on a foam head, put it up
in my chair, like it was a real person.

08:43.494 --> 08:44.525
You believe that?

08:45.287 --> 08:46.568
That's something.

08:47.748 --> 08:51.497
She didn't tip for shit, either.
I hate doing wigs.

08:53.713 --> 08:56.583
You know, I always wondered what I'd
look like with long hair.

08:57.758 --> 09:00.166
- That is a funny image, Boyd.
- I'm serious.

09:01.011 --> 09:05.555
I thought if I had long hair, I might
be the lead singer in a rock band.

09:06.976 --> 09:08.007
I love music.

09:08.602 --> 09:10.761
- Well, can you sing?
- No.

09:11.313 --> 09:13.057
No, I can't sing, not a lick.

09:13.357 --> 09:14.851
But my grandmother, she could sing.

09:17.027 --> 09:18.854
She would sing out in the backyard,

09:19.947 --> 09:21.322
and I'd sit and listen to her.

09:22.366 --> 09:23.362
It calmed me.

09:25.035 --> 09:27.324
- Well, life is long.
- Yeah.

09:30.791 --> 09:32.120
You expecting company?

09:33.461 --> 09:34.955
Ava, you best go inside.

09:38.424 --> 09:41.045
- Friends of yours?
- Go on in and lock the door.

09:47.308 --> 09:48.422
Stop right there.

09:50.394 --> 09:52.102
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.020
What I did to you was uncalled for.

09:56.442 --> 09:59.277
It's just that I get confused in my head

09:59.987 --> 10:02.063
whenever I think about
such painful things.

10:07.036 --> 10:09.408
It's all right, Boyd.
It ain't what we're here for.

10:13.876 --> 10:15.536
What are you here for?

10:17.463 --> 10:20.832
You know my buddy Pruitt. Feels real bad
about how he talked to you at the mine.

10:21.634 --> 10:22.748
This is Marcus.

11:03.092 --> 11:04.467
- Here you go.
- Hey, thanks.

11:04.718 --> 11:06.094
Olander's got a hard-on for you.

11:08.848 --> 11:10.390
Oh, shit!

11:16.313 --> 11:17.309
Hey.

11:19.066 --> 11:20.774
You know what this chart is, dawg?

11:22.111 --> 11:23.107
The service log.

11:23.654 --> 11:25.777
You were scheduled to service
the main bathroom last night.

11:26.657 --> 11:27.688
Bathroom?

11:27.992 --> 11:31.195
Nobody likes to mop up
piss and shit, homes.

11:31.537 --> 11:33.161
Think I don't know that?

11:33.455 --> 11:36.291
I must have misread it.
I did kitchen duty instead.

11:37.334 --> 11:39.078
Well, that's one hell of a screw-up.

11:39.628 --> 11:42.298
Okay. I'll get on it right now.

11:42.506 --> 11:43.502
No, sit down.

11:45.009 --> 11:48.294
- Well, you want me to...
- We're not done until I say we're done.

11:50.848 --> 11:51.844
Sit.

11:56.353 --> 11:59.354
You're a good homeboy,
so I'm gonna walk it out.

12:01.275 --> 12:06.020
I snorted, shot, drank, grundled,
and douched more junk before I was 30

12:06.155 --> 12:08.361
than Rick James did in his lifetime.

12:08.741 --> 12:11.445
And I'm still kicking.
You want to know why?

12:11.994 --> 12:13.737
Because I am the stair master.

12:14.288 --> 12:19.448
Yeah, I climb all twelve steps
dozens of times, every day.

12:20.628 --> 12:21.742
And that's admirable.

12:21.879 --> 12:23.871
You skipped out on
your responsibilities.

12:24.715 --> 12:26.375
And now there's a price to pay.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.627
You need to make an inventory,

12:29.094 --> 12:30.505
and I want you to make amends.

12:30.638 --> 12:33.674
Okay, all right.
There are no excuses, all right?

12:33.849 --> 12:36.885
I know. And that's why I
cancelled your day pass.

12:37.019 --> 12:40.269
Now, I want you to go upstairs,
work on your self-appraisal,

12:40.439 --> 12:41.850
and be at the 3:00 meeting.

12:41.982 --> 12:45.434
- Don't do that. I got some real big...
- I know about your plans.

12:45.903 --> 12:47.314
You'll have to reschedule for next week.

12:49.448 --> 12:51.322
It won't be his birthday next week.

12:53.953 --> 12:56.870
This is a baby bitch slap.

12:57.247 --> 13:01.245
If I was really upset, I'd yank your
chain all the way back to Correction.

13:01.627 --> 13:02.706
Bullshit!

13:03.420 --> 13:07.370
Ding-dong! You just earned yourself
a 30-day pass suspension.

13:07.508 --> 13:09.915
You can use the month to work on
your lack of respect!

13:10.594 --> 13:13.595
Now get out of my office. Now!

13:28.278 --> 13:31.149
Mr. Arnett, this is
Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens.

13:32.032 --> 13:33.313
Not our first tango.

13:34.118 --> 13:35.612
Raylan, please have a seat.

13:36.245 --> 13:37.573
How do you take your coffee?

13:37.871 --> 13:39.745
No, nothing for me, thank you.

13:39.873 --> 13:43.741
The usual for me, Yvette. Make two
in case the deputy changes his mind.

13:44.336 --> 13:46.044
You want a little kick?
Mr. Arnett likes a little kick.

13:46.171 --> 13:47.167
- He'll have a nudge.
- Okay.

13:49.425 --> 13:52.509
- That Piper Van Winkle?
- Yeah, Frankfort's own.

13:53.012 --> 13:56.297
This particular concoction is a private
single-barrel made especially for me.

13:56.974 --> 13:59.216
Takes the edge off those bitter beans.

13:59.351 --> 14:01.474
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:01.979 --> 14:03.354
Just give me a buzz
if you need anything.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.603
- You know I will.
- Okay.

14:09.361 --> 14:10.986
Are you wearing pants?

14:12.573 --> 14:15.064
I like to maintain my creases.
Stay sharp.

14:17.494 --> 14:19.368
I suppose there's no reason to get up.

14:19.747 --> 14:23.661
Hoping to have a civil discussion, avoid the
gunplay that erupted last time I saw you.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.121
Yes, that was unfortunate.

14:25.252 --> 14:28.123
But, you know, it's because of that
wild day that I agreed to this meeting.

14:28.505 --> 14:30.712
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Quite frankly, I owe you one.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.541
You advised Gary to sign over
that mall property to me.

14:33.677 --> 14:36.049
- That's not why I'm here.
- I sold that property, and I took the money,

14:36.180 --> 14:37.508
and I invested in foreclosures.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.514
So when the market bounces back,

14:39.850 --> 14:43.717
I'm gonna be managing a multimillion-dollar
fortune in Kentucky bluegrass.

14:44.271 --> 14:46.098
So you are legitimate now.

14:47.149 --> 14:51.194
The Frankfort branch of the Dixie Mafia
has lost its best wheeler-dealer.

14:51.945 --> 14:53.488
You believe in the Dixie Mafia,

14:54.073 --> 14:57.691
I got me a toy factory in the North Pole
you should invest in.

14:57.868 --> 15:01.700
Does Yvette know about any of the
shit you did before real estate?

15:02.331 --> 15:05.415
Yvette has no interest in my past.
Makes her so special.

15:06.794 --> 15:09.913
And what about the new associates?
Do they know your résumé?

15:12.466 --> 15:13.581
Are you blackmailing me?

15:13.759 --> 15:17.804
No, this is just, you know,
good, old-fashioned leverage.

15:18.138 --> 15:19.680
Well, putting aside
that you've jumped to

15:19.807 --> 15:22.380
some rather scandalous
conclusions about me,

15:22.559 --> 15:25.560
I can absolutely assure you
you're talking to the wrong guy here.

15:25.687 --> 15:26.767
Who should I be talking to?

15:27.147 --> 15:29.685
You might try the guy who tried
to kill me on that wild day.

15:31.026 --> 15:33.564
- Wynn Duffy?
- I hear he's taken over some

15:33.946 --> 15:36.519
management responsibilities
with a certain organisation

15:36.657 --> 15:38.566
I have no interest in
being affiliated with.

15:39.076 --> 15:40.190
That doesn't even exist, anyway.

15:43.122 --> 15:44.117
Well,

15:45.749 --> 15:47.825
if you talk to him,
and I'm gonna assume you will,

15:48.043 --> 15:51.127
will you tell him that Oxy bus
he lost down in Harlan,

15:51.338 --> 15:52.963
he should just write that off.

15:53.090 --> 15:57.835
If he goes down there, chopping off limbs,
I'm gonna personally turn him inside out.

15:59.221 --> 16:00.217
Would you tell him that for me?

16:01.390 --> 16:03.632
- Well, as I said...
- Would you tell him that for me?

16:06.395 --> 16:07.593
If I talk to him.

16:13.819 --> 16:15.313
Dear Lord!

16:23.036 --> 16:24.365
Was it Vinnie?

16:25.831 --> 16:27.408
- Clinton?
- Clinton.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.827
Do I call the police or the Marshals?

16:30.461 --> 16:32.619
- No, we're not calling anybody.
- What?

16:32.754 --> 16:33.834
I'm gonna bring him back.

16:36.216 --> 16:37.331
I know where he's going.

16:45.517 --> 16:46.548
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:47.519 --> 16:49.227
You still do that before
you show a house?

16:50.272 --> 16:52.181
What, vanilla on foil? Of course.

16:52.316 --> 16:55.981
Ten minutes at 350, smells like fresh
cookies baking.

16:57.070 --> 16:58.399
You know, every room
in the Biltmore mansion

16:58.530 --> 17:01.152
was connected to the kitchen,
so anyone staying there

17:01.325 --> 17:04.279
- would wake to the smell of...
- Fresh bread, yeah. I know.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.867
- Told you that before, huh?
- Once or twice.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.079
- Well, thanks for coming by.
- Listen, Gary.

17:12.211 --> 17:16.374
Raylan told me that you talked
and what you said.

17:17.549 --> 17:18.794
I didn't think he'd do that.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.425
I just want you to know that anything
that happened with us

17:21.553 --> 17:23.760
happened after you moved out, okay?

17:25.598 --> 17:26.797
Thank you for that.

17:27.517 --> 17:31.266
But the truth is, you wouldn't have
gone back to Raylan if I hadn't screwed up.

17:32.856 --> 17:34.398
Yeah, why did you do that, Gary?

17:34.524 --> 17:37.395
Why did you tell him that
you were gonna try and get me back?

17:37.528 --> 17:38.808
I wanted him to know.

17:40.322 --> 17:41.781
It wasn't because you
wanted me to know?

17:43.242 --> 17:44.949
Well, I was hoping you already knew.

17:47.079 --> 17:48.110
Winona...

17:49.998 --> 17:52.869
I love you. I have never stopped.

17:54.253 --> 17:56.625
And I do want you back. Simple as that.

17:57.005 --> 17:58.832
How do you plan on doing that, Gary?

17:59.716 --> 18:02.920
You know, fixing everything that
happened, restoring that trust?

18:03.053 --> 18:07.133
'Cause I tell you what, it's gonna
take more than foil on vanilla.

18:07.307 --> 18:09.347
Yeah, well, that's why
I asked you to come over.

18:13.021 --> 18:18.857
Now, I know the only way to restore trust
is to be dead, straight honest, you know?

18:18.986 --> 18:20.812
Not hide anything I might want to hide.

18:22.614 --> 18:23.777
All right. So what is it?

18:24.199 --> 18:25.658
We need to get a divorce.

18:30.789 --> 18:32.164
Hey. What's going on?

18:32.291 --> 18:34.864
A call came in from a receptionist
at the halfway house

18:35.002 --> 18:37.409
where my brother-in-law, Clinton,
was assigned for parole.

18:38.130 --> 18:41.296
Apparently, Clinton beat the shit out of
his programme manager and took off.

18:41.925 --> 18:44.463
- Your brother-in-law is on parole?
- Long story.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.756
The receptionist sat on her ass for over
an hour before she called it in.

18:47.889 --> 18:49.300
The programme
manager told her not to.

18:49.433 --> 18:52.434
He said he knew where Clinton was headed,
and he wanted to bring him in himself.

18:52.561 --> 18:53.972
Does the receptionist know
where he's headed?

18:54.146 --> 18:55.770
- Nope.
- It's my nephew, Nick,

18:55.897 --> 18:57.060
Clinton's son. It's his birthday.

18:57.190 --> 18:59.266
I'm guessing he'll make a beeline
toward Nick's school.

18:59.818 --> 19:01.229
You already put a BOLO out on him?

19:01.361 --> 19:04.066
Nah, I figured since he's your
brother-in-law, I'd just let it slide.

19:04.197 --> 19:06.071
We'll need a team
to lock down Nick's campus.

19:06.325 --> 19:08.483
Absolutely, but you
won't be taking lead.

19:08.785 --> 19:09.983
- Chief...
- No.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.991
You just get Nick, and you bring him
back here. Raylan, you set up and wait.

19:14.374 --> 19:16.616
Hey, how much of a bad guy
is her brother-in-law?

19:16.793 --> 19:18.952
"Heads in a duffel bag"
or just an asshole?

19:19.087 --> 19:20.416
He killed her sister.

19:32.809 --> 19:33.841
Flex.

19:35.437 --> 19:37.560
- You look good.
- Been a long while, bro.

19:37.773 --> 19:39.433
Better than last time I saw you.

19:40.442 --> 19:41.438
Can we spit?

19:42.069 --> 19:43.064
Get in.

19:44.237 --> 19:45.613
Cool.

19:47.741 --> 19:50.944
You better not be looking to score.
I'm out of the trade.

19:51.078 --> 19:52.109
Okay.

19:52.621 --> 19:57.081
I'm becoming a magician,
like that <i>Mindfreak</i> guy.

19:57.292 --> 20:00.910
I'm gonna be the first big,
badass black magician.

20:01.046 --> 20:03.038
Learning all the basics on YouTube.

20:03.632 --> 20:07.712
I can do shit with a coin would
make your eyes pop out.

20:09.721 --> 20:11.465
You got a name for your act?

20:12.474 --> 20:17.017
Just Flex. Not "The Amazing Flex"
or none of that shit. Just Flex.

20:17.145 --> 20:18.260
Flex.

20:18.730 --> 20:19.761
Got muscle

20:20.190 --> 20:21.221
and attitude.

20:22.526 --> 20:23.521
How you been?

20:24.736 --> 20:25.934
You look clean.

20:26.905 --> 20:29.028
I quit after I copped to the truth.

20:29.783 --> 20:31.692
You ain't looking to score,
what you out here for?

20:35.080 --> 20:37.867
I got this here for my little man.
It's his birthday.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.287
What is that?

20:40.961 --> 20:43.582
Before I went in, this here
is all he ever wanted.

20:43.713 --> 20:45.291
That and go to Billy the Kidzone.

20:47.050 --> 20:48.509
It's like Chuck E. Cheese.

20:49.052 --> 20:50.048
Pizza, games,

20:50.429 --> 20:51.839
only with cowboys.

20:53.098 --> 20:54.378
How old's your boy?

20:54.724 --> 20:55.923
12 today.

20:57.394 --> 21:01.226
Anyhow, I got to go pick him up
from school today.

21:02.732 --> 21:03.728
Catch a ride?

21:04.234 --> 21:05.397
No can do. I got errands.

21:05.861 --> 21:07.900
Okay. You know, spot me $100.

21:08.947 --> 21:10.940
I got to be at Man O'War before 3:00.

21:11.074 --> 21:13.197
Won't make it fooling around
on that bus, you know.

21:13.577 --> 21:16.328
Strict policy, chief.
I don't loan out money.

21:16.621 --> 21:17.997
$75. I'll get you right back.

21:18.415 --> 21:20.123
This conversation's done.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.413
Get out.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.667
Do me a solid, man.
I'm trying to go get my boy.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.418
This is bullshit, man. It's real bullshit!

21:28.550 --> 21:30.210
Since when did you
become such a pussy?

21:32.012 --> 21:33.340
Since you became a bitch.

21:33.472 --> 21:34.966
- Get out!
- Get your hands off me!

21:35.098 --> 21:36.296
Get your hands off me!

21:36.892 --> 21:38.386
Hey, hey!

21:39.519 --> 21:41.179
God! Shit!

21:44.024 --> 21:47.108
Come back here! Hey!
You hurt my hand!

21:55.035 --> 21:56.197
Can I leave the door open?

21:56.328 --> 21:57.442
Open's good.

21:59.664 --> 22:01.075
What are you gonna tell them?

22:01.458 --> 22:03.497
I heard the whole thing.
Don't even bother lying about it.

22:04.878 --> 22:08.211
Well, I wasn't gonna lie to you about it.

22:11.968 --> 22:13.925
And...

22:16.515 --> 22:18.388
I'm gonna tell them no.

22:19.518 --> 22:20.716
That's not what you said last night.

22:21.228 --> 22:24.015
Well, I said I'd think about it.

22:24.523 --> 22:26.183
You know I won't tolerate
criminal activity.

22:26.316 --> 22:27.775
Well, I have no interest in that.

22:28.818 --> 22:30.313
Then why didn't you just
say no when they asked?

22:32.614 --> 22:33.894
I was being polite.

22:34.616 --> 22:35.612
Polite?

22:36.493 --> 22:37.489
Polite.

22:38.954 --> 22:40.412
Ava, you have my word.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.958
You have a good day.

23:06.356 --> 23:08.265
Suspect approaching, black Chevy
Chevelle with racing stripes.

23:12.487 --> 23:13.518
US Marshals!

23:14.906 --> 23:17.148
I work with your sister-in-law,
Rachel Brooks.

23:17.617 --> 23:19.824
Your son is in a safe place.

23:20.287 --> 23:21.947
Just came to give my boy a gift.

23:22.289 --> 23:25.954
Give it to me. I'll see he gets it.
Now I need you to shut off your car.

23:34.009 --> 23:35.040
Nice car.

23:37.804 --> 23:38.800
Here's one for you.

23:40.390 --> 23:41.801
I found you a husband.

23:41.933 --> 23:43.641
Are you on a dating site?

23:43.768 --> 23:46.176
You were supposed to
be playing solitaire.

23:50.317 --> 23:52.724
- It's funny.
- I know. He's old,

23:52.861 --> 23:53.940
and he's white.

23:54.070 --> 23:55.399
But he gets out in three years.

24:01.369 --> 24:03.278
- Hey, Winona.
- Raylan.

24:05.206 --> 24:06.749
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why, do I not look okay?

24:07.626 --> 24:09.120
Well, you look...

24:10.462 --> 24:11.742
- It's just, I got to...
- Because I'm not okay.

24:14.049 --> 24:15.507
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

24:15.967 --> 24:17.296
Whatever I did or didn't do.

24:18.094 --> 24:20.217
Why do you assume that when
I'm upset, I'm upset with you?

24:21.264 --> 24:22.593
You're usually upset with me.

24:22.724 --> 24:23.720
That's true.

24:24.768 --> 24:27.555
Gary asked me to his office.
He said we need to get a divorce.

24:28.730 --> 24:29.726
Wonderful.

24:31.066 --> 24:32.441
I mean, I'm so sorry.

24:33.902 --> 24:36.819
He only said it because
our mortgage is upside down.

24:37.906 --> 24:39.566
We owe more on the house
than what it's worth.

24:39.699 --> 24:41.324
I know what "upside down" means.

24:41.451 --> 24:43.278
Okay. I guess he figures
that if we get a divorce,

24:43.411 --> 24:45.285
then I can give him the house
in the agreement,

24:45.413 --> 24:47.406
and then he's the only one who's
gonna be dragged under in all this,

24:47.540 --> 24:48.572
and that would make me
feel guiltier than shit,

24:48.708 --> 24:51.828
because the only reason we have this great
big house is because I wanted one.

24:52.504 --> 24:53.666
He's a damn genius.

24:54.381 --> 24:57.381
He suggests divorce, knowing you'd
feel too guilty to follow through.

24:57.842 --> 24:59.253
Well-played, Gary.

24:59.761 --> 25:00.757
What are you talking about?

25:01.346 --> 25:03.089
He's just trying to show
you he's a good guy.

25:03.848 --> 25:05.841
And somehow being a good guy
is underhanded?

25:05.975 --> 25:07.386
He's just trying to win you back.

25:07.519 --> 25:09.476
I still don't see why that's
such a big problem.

25:09.604 --> 25:11.312
How much you need to keep the house?

25:11.606 --> 25:13.848
Why? Is that gonna be
your big play to win me?

25:14.109 --> 25:15.104
I have savings.

25:15.235 --> 25:17.108
How much?

25:18.071 --> 25:20.110
$800, $900 easy.

25:22.492 --> 25:23.903
- I really should go.
- Okay.

25:30.417 --> 25:31.875
What's up, Nick?

25:32.168 --> 25:33.497
I have a bunch of these already.

25:33.628 --> 25:34.707
Well, now you got one more.

25:34.838 --> 25:35.917
What are you doing?

25:36.047 --> 25:37.126
Finding Rachel a husband.

25:37.298 --> 25:38.709
Nick, go get a soda.

25:39.884 --> 25:42.007
You're gonna end up bitter and alone.

25:42.762 --> 25:43.877
You let Clinton get away.

25:44.264 --> 25:45.675
- You take this call?
- Five minutes ago.

25:45.807 --> 25:46.803
What's he want?

25:46.933 --> 25:48.807
I don't know. I took down the number.
Be grateful for that.

25:49.686 --> 25:50.765
Anything on the partial?

25:50.895 --> 25:53.730
The only Chevelle with those letters
belongs to a drug dealer...

25:53.857 --> 25:55.232
Look no further.

25:55.358 --> 25:58.193
By the name of Ralph Beeman.
Goes by the name of Flex.

25:58.319 --> 25:59.564
I put out a BOLO on him.

26:00.238 --> 26:01.234
Anything from your mother?

26:01.364 --> 26:04.318
No. I tried calling. There's no response.
I'm heading there now.

26:05.118 --> 26:07.988
Do you want to go there,
or do you need to go there?

26:08.413 --> 26:10.951
You honestly think I want to
cap my brother-in-law?

26:14.043 --> 26:15.206
Raylan, go with her.

26:18.089 --> 26:19.252
You want me to shoot him?

26:27.515 --> 26:29.472
Just reading his file here. How did he...

26:29.601 --> 26:30.799
Kill my sister?

26:31.686 --> 26:32.967
Driving while high.

26:33.271 --> 26:35.844
Wrapped their Miata
around a telephone pole.

26:36.191 --> 26:37.566
Shawnee went through the windshield.

26:45.658 --> 26:47.734
Ma, open up!

26:52.582 --> 26:53.745
Ma!

27:18.525 --> 27:19.520
Ma!

27:35.792 --> 27:40.003
He kept saying he wanted my car.
I said I flushed the key.

27:41.381 --> 27:42.377
Did you?

27:42.507 --> 27:44.998
No, but it sounded good.

27:45.927 --> 27:47.172
And then you started shooting.

27:47.345 --> 27:48.887
You should spend some
time at the range.

27:49.013 --> 27:50.472
She has.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.808
Almost clipped his arm a couple of times,
just trying to keep him from leaving.

27:53.935 --> 27:54.931
He took your gun?

27:55.270 --> 27:56.550
And my extra clip.

27:57.522 --> 28:01.057
Rachel, honey, I want you to promise me,
you catch him, you won't shoot him.

28:01.192 --> 28:03.019
You just tried to shoot him yourself.

28:03.153 --> 28:05.940
I was just trying to keep him still.
You're the one who wants to kill him.

28:06.865 --> 28:09.153
Why does everyone think I'm
so hell-bent on killing him?

28:09.284 --> 28:10.694
I know you blame him, but he...

28:10.827 --> 28:12.238
Of course I blame him.

28:12.370 --> 28:13.615
He wanted to help her.

28:14.247 --> 28:15.362
Help her?

28:15.498 --> 28:16.957
Clinton tried to save Shawnee's life.

28:17.292 --> 28:19.368
- Okay.
- She overdosed.

28:19.711 --> 28:22.830
This man tied you down in your own
home, and now you're defending him.

28:22.964 --> 28:26.333
I am not defending him!
I'm trying to explain him!

28:28.428 --> 28:31.678
He was taking Shawnee to the
emergency room when they crashed.

28:31.890 --> 28:32.885
Okay. Givens.

28:33.850 --> 28:35.593
Clinton's got problems,
but he loved your sister.

28:35.727 --> 28:36.722
Where?

28:36.853 --> 28:39.059
- Loved her enough to pump her with poison.
- On our way.

28:39.188 --> 28:42.522
She was addicted before she met him.
You know that.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.860
Clinton called the office looking
for you. Wants to make a deal.

28:50.366 --> 28:51.825
Another Coke?

28:52.410 --> 28:53.573
Why stop at four?

28:53.703 --> 28:55.909
Want me to bring this back in the
kitchen, warm it up?

28:56.122 --> 28:58.530
Sure. I should have
waited to order, anyhow.

28:58.666 --> 29:00.326
Someone's running late, huh?

29:00.460 --> 29:03.793
Yeah. He and his aunt better hurry up,
or he ain't getting his birthday present.

29:06.090 --> 29:07.205
Ain't that right, Furbot?

29:09.677 --> 29:10.792
I don't know why this
thing speaks Chinese.

29:12.388 --> 29:14.428
Okay, that's enough out of you.

29:15.975 --> 29:17.968
Clinton! What are you doing?

29:19.938 --> 29:20.933
Come on. We're going.

29:21.731 --> 29:22.846
I don't think so.

29:23.483 --> 29:25.025
I told you it's my boy's birthday.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.640
Well, he ain't here.

29:26.778 --> 29:28.438
Sophie? Can I see you for a moment?

29:28.571 --> 29:29.734
Just a second. Can I get you anything?

29:29.864 --> 29:31.193
- Right now or you're fired!
- Okay!

29:31.324 --> 29:33.400
Mr. Cranky Pants needs a
chocolate bar. I'll be right back.

29:35.078 --> 29:36.073
Let's go.

29:36.496 --> 29:39.532
You didn't get the impression
I was serious this morning?

29:39.916 --> 29:42.870
I'd kindly give you another go-round,
if that's what you want.

29:43.419 --> 29:46.254
You want to threaten me, smart guy?
Beat me down again?

29:48.716 --> 29:51.551
I'm here to help, asshole.
I'm giving you another chance.

29:52.387 --> 29:53.549
Why?

29:54.097 --> 29:56.469
I don't run the house
for the fun of it, Clinton.

29:56.599 --> 29:58.924
It's what I believe in. It's what I do.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.056
It's why I didn't call the police.

30:00.603 --> 30:02.643
That's all right, 'cause I just did.

30:03.648 --> 30:04.763
What?

30:06.734 --> 30:07.897
Oh, shit.

30:13.074 --> 30:14.070
Who is he?

30:15.159 --> 30:16.155
Who am I?

30:17.370 --> 30:18.366
Who are you?

30:18.496 --> 30:20.619
I'm an associate of
none of your goddamn business.

30:21.833 --> 30:23.078
You got to be kidding me.

30:23.209 --> 30:26.245
Yeah, that's right.
We got some shit to talk about.

30:27.046 --> 30:29.751
And that piece you got underneath,
just put it up on the table slow.

30:30.842 --> 30:33.214
I conversate best when
I'm nice and relaxed.

30:42.353 --> 30:43.349
Let me tell you something, slick,

30:43.980 --> 30:47.265
whatever this is about, we can do it the
easy way. Isn't that right, Clinton?

30:47.400 --> 30:48.728
Shut up, Olander.

30:48.860 --> 30:50.983
Yeah, man, shut up.
Go play <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

30:51.821 --> 30:54.312
I'm an officer of the law.
Put the gun down.

30:54.907 --> 30:57.066
You're moving to the top
of my list real fast.

30:57.201 --> 30:58.861
We're adults.
We're gonna talk this through.

30:58.995 --> 31:00.240
We don't need guns.

31:02.832 --> 31:06.035
You have any idea the
ramifications of what you did?

31:06.794 --> 31:10.128
I was gonna be a magician, you dick.

31:10.673 --> 31:13.460
How the hell am I supposed to
do magic with this hand now?

31:13.926 --> 31:15.006
I'm not!

31:15.845 --> 31:17.220
That's the answer!

31:18.723 --> 31:20.003
I'm not.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.018
Your punk ass could
have gave me a ride.

31:24.270 --> 31:25.812
This is my fault now?

31:26.439 --> 31:28.478
He's right, Clinton.
We don't blame other peo...

31:29.025 --> 31:30.353
Where's my car?

31:30.985 --> 31:32.016
I ain't got it, bro.

31:32.528 --> 31:34.153
See, Clinton, that's the wrong answer.

31:35.156 --> 31:36.354
What you're supposed to say is,

31:36.491 --> 31:40.405
"Of course you don't see it out front,
Flex, since I parked it in the back."

31:41.287 --> 31:43.908
But you didn't say that.

31:44.207 --> 31:45.202
I ditched it.

31:46.042 --> 31:47.121
Where?

31:48.169 --> 31:51.538
'Cause I had a whole shitload of dope
tucked into the panels of that car.

31:53.549 --> 31:54.629
Which hand you jack off with?

31:55.968 --> 31:57.131
US Marshals! No one move!

32:02.183 --> 32:03.179
Don't shoot!

32:03.309 --> 32:04.590
Get back! Get back!

32:04.727 --> 32:06.056
Clinton.

32:06.187 --> 32:07.218
Where's my son?

32:07.355 --> 32:09.098
You honestly thought
I'd bring him here?

32:12.401 --> 32:13.860
I need to see my son!

32:19.158 --> 32:20.950
I just wanted to give him his gift.

32:23.621 --> 32:25.163
Shit.

32:29.377 --> 32:31.251
- Get back!
- Don't shoot.

32:31.379 --> 32:32.873
You don't come any closer.

32:33.005 --> 32:34.168
Don't shoot.

32:34.674 --> 32:36.797
Is this how you want Nick to
remember his 12th birthday?

32:37.552 --> 32:39.295
His father shooting an innocent man?

32:52.775 --> 32:54.056
Get up!

33:00.116 --> 33:01.610
I loved your sister.

33:03.703 --> 33:04.948
So did I.

33:11.711 --> 33:14.416
Why do I have the office where
the deputies shoot people?

33:14.839 --> 33:16.463
Nothing wrong with this one.

33:16.632 --> 33:19.302
Meaning that there are things wrong
with the other ones you've done?

33:19.427 --> 33:22.878
Tell you the only thing wrong with this
shooting. She reacted faster than I did.

33:23.014 --> 33:24.009
You're getting old.

33:24.599 --> 33:25.594
Not as old as you.

33:26.475 --> 33:27.590
And you're a dick.

33:27.894 --> 33:31.726
I'll talk to her tomorrow, but you're gonna
have to walk her through the process.

33:31.856 --> 33:33.231
Okay. I will.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.025
I hope this doesn't
affect her ambitions.

33:36.694 --> 33:38.521
I do, too.
She's the best marshal I've got.

33:38.988 --> 33:40.233
You realise I'm sitting right here?

33:41.032 --> 33:42.027
I do.

33:42.742 --> 33:44.022
How'd it go in Frankfort?

33:44.660 --> 33:46.653
Arnett swears he's out of the game.

33:46.954 --> 33:49.659
Pointed me to the man who used to
be his gun thug, Wynn Duffy.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.617
I also got a call from
Dewey Crowe's lawyer.

33:51.751 --> 33:52.747
Concerning?

33:53.586 --> 33:55.662
Says Dewey knows about some
shit going down in Harlan

33:55.796 --> 33:57.291
that might be worth our while.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.836
And what do you think?

33:59.175 --> 34:00.799
Knowing Dewey? Bullshit.

34:21.614 --> 34:23.156
Look at you, boy.

34:23.616 --> 34:26.900
Growing all tall and getting muscles.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.527
You shaving yet?

34:31.748 --> 34:33.029
I'm 12.

34:37.797 --> 34:38.793
I got this for you.

34:42.092 --> 34:43.088
Thanks.

34:51.351 --> 34:52.632
You know what that is?

34:53.312 --> 34:54.475
A Furby?

34:54.647 --> 34:55.762
Furbot.

34:56.399 --> 34:57.597
It's a cheap knockoff.

34:58.276 --> 34:59.770
It only spoke Chinese.

35:00.820 --> 35:02.729
Chinese? How's it work?

35:03.406 --> 35:04.520
It doesn't.

35:05.157 --> 35:06.189
Somebody shot it.

35:11.330 --> 35:13.702
Who would shoot Furby?
What did he ever do to anybody?

35:16.210 --> 35:17.206
Can I keep it?

35:19.880 --> 35:20.876
If you want.

35:22.425 --> 35:24.713
What's this stain here?
Is that chocolate?

35:25.052 --> 35:26.333
No. That's...

35:31.517 --> 35:32.798
That's blood.

35:35.521 --> 35:39.388
When I was Nick's age,
before my father's cancer,

35:40.067 --> 35:42.024
I thought we were the Cosbys.

35:44.113 --> 35:45.773
My parents had good jobs.

35:47.241 --> 35:50.277
There was a feast on the table
after church on Sundays.

35:51.787 --> 35:54.741
Shawnee and I would ride our
Huffys around the neighbourhood.

35:56.167 --> 35:59.168
We had good hair and
made straight A's.

35:59.795 --> 36:02.630
Except, as my mother reminds me,

36:02.923 --> 36:04.501
that wasn't reality.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.918
The jobs weren't all that good, and

36:08.596 --> 36:12.131
my father was never a happy man,
even before he got sick.

36:12.975 --> 36:16.095
And Shawnee was
smoking pot at nine and

36:16.604 --> 36:19.355
running away to smoke
heroin at fifteen.

36:21.692 --> 36:25.026
I never bore any illusions that my
family was the Cosbys.

36:26.030 --> 36:28.022
Your family wasn't funny.

36:28.282 --> 36:30.358
At least you got to shoot your father.

36:31.243 --> 36:35.241
Mine had the nerve to die before I got back
from basic with skills and a loaded weapon.

36:35.706 --> 36:36.869
You didn't miss much.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.909
I thought it was gonna be
way more fun than it was.

36:48.052 --> 36:50.044
- You heading out?
- In a minute.

36:51.931 --> 36:53.129
I'll wait.

36:55.184 --> 36:56.180
Don't.

37:01.941 --> 37:04.229
You having any second
thoughts about the shooting?

37:05.361 --> 37:06.357
Not really.

37:06.612 --> 37:07.608
You will.

37:08.906 --> 37:11.575
But if you ever have any
serious doubts, ask me.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.238
I'll tell you.
You did what had to be done.

37:42.606 --> 37:43.602
Hey, Ezekiel.

37:45.609 --> 37:46.605
Kyle.

37:46.735 --> 37:48.360
You didn't think you'd get to leave
without seeing me, did you?

37:48.487 --> 37:50.978
I thought about your request
and must politely decline.

37:51.115 --> 37:52.111
What are you talking about?

37:52.241 --> 37:53.901
Well, as I've made
myself abundantly clear,

37:55.286 --> 37:57.029
I'm no longer in that line of work.

37:57.580 --> 37:58.694
You ain't even heard the scheme yet.

37:58.831 --> 38:01.951
Right now I know nothing about it.
If anyone asks, I'll stick to that.

38:03.502 --> 38:05.958
Your share alone is $40,000.

38:07.173 --> 38:08.168
You're wasting your time.

38:08.299 --> 38:09.757
That doghole pays people in cash
at the end of every shift.

38:09.884 --> 38:12.754
No more than $20,000 at any
one time precisely for this reason.

38:13.053 --> 38:15.093
You notice, huh?

38:18.893 --> 38:20.387
Well, what would you say
if somebody had a friend

38:20.519 --> 38:21.930
who worked for the
armoured-car company

38:22.188 --> 38:24.476
who could provide engine trouble
four days running,

38:24.940 --> 38:28.190
stalling deliveries so there would be
$80,000 cash at one time?

38:28.360 --> 38:31.564
Then I'd say there's still no way to get down
off this mountain without getting caught.

38:31.697 --> 38:34.153
What if there's a way not
only you not get caught,

38:34.992 --> 38:35.988
but get treated like a hero?

38:38.370 --> 38:40.944
Like one of those
miners down in Chile?
