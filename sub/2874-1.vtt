That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.850
Osiris knew that his time
had come on Earth...

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.280
so he had
this pyramid built

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.720
for his journey
into the afterlife.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.166

You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.608
Anubis turned his wrath
on the people.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.007
He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.049
so he could join his father
in the afterlife.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.011
Since his soul
was corrupted,

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.730
he was looking
for a pure one...

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.928
a pure heart, if you will.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.082
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.084
My father was right.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.328
This pyramid
became a prison.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.440
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own god.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.285
Nora, does this thing
give us any clues

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.850
on how to get out of here?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.485

about a star map.

gonna be back any minute now!

points to where the dead

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.210
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.603
<i>Prepare my grave</i>

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.690
<i>For what I know,
it's waiting</i>

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.081
<i>I welcome in</i>

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.724
<i>All that I am fearing</i>

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.770
<i>There's no way out</i>

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.684
<i>Now I must shed my skin</i>

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:42.086
<i>The only way through
the flame of fire within</i>

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.641
<i>I will sacrifice</i>

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.200
<i>More than a thousand lives</i>

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.130
<i>My soul won't be crucified</i>

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.080
<i>Get back what
you took from me</i>

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.970
Me...

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.445
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.565
<i>In the day there is night</i>

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.604
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.570
<i>I started a war</i>

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.763
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.611
<i>In the day there is night</i>

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.690
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.650
<i>I started a war</i>

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.684
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.565
<i>In the day there is night</i>

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.605
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.491
<i>I started a war</i>

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.486
<i>In the dark there is light</i>

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.770
<i>In the day there is night</i>

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.725
<i>In the peace there is fight</i>

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.440
<i>I started a war</i>
