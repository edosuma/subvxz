00:02.966 --> 00:04.200
Previously,
on "The Originals"...

00:04.201 --> 00:06.684
This town
was my home once,

00:06.685 --> 00:09.074
and in my absence,
Marcel has got

00:09.075 --> 00:10.656
everything
I ever wanted.

00:10.657 --> 00:12.285
I want it back.

00:12.286 --> 00:14.126
I hereby pledge
my allegiance to you.

00:14.127 --> 00:16.729
Celeste.
Celeste?

00:16.730 --> 00:19.063
Whoever she was,
she was smoking hot.

00:19.064 --> 00:20.431
I believe that when
you love someone,

00:20.432 --> 00:21.867
you're uniquely
vulnerable.

00:21.868 --> 00:23.169
She died because of me.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.870
Davina,
she's a powerful weapon.

00:24.871 --> 00:26.238
Yaah!

00:26.239 --> 00:27.540
I knew that I was supposed
to be killed

00:27.541 --> 00:30.509
so the harvest
could be completed.

00:30.510 --> 00:33.344
She is dead!
Do you hear me?

00:33.345 --> 00:35.936
4 were supposed
to rise, and none did.

00:35.937 --> 00:38.063
Where did
all that power go?

00:38.064 --> 00:41.186
Someone
called us forth. Who?

00:41.187 --> 00:42.721
I did.

00:42.722 --> 00:45.153
I'd appreciate if you
call me by my real name...

00:45.154 --> 00:47.225
Celeste.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.899
Oh...

00:53.900 --> 00:56.768
I remember
this cemetery.

00:56.769 --> 00:59.404
Hmm. Hasn't
changed a bit.

00:59.405 --> 01:01.545
I've been coming here
over a century

01:01.546 --> 01:03.879
wearing one face
or another.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.064 --> 01:30.101
Clara Summerlin,
will you come on?

01:30.102 --> 01:32.637
We're gonna miss
everything.

01:47.819 --> 01:49.634
Told you.

01:49.635 --> 01:51.720
Every witch in
the quarter is here,

01:51.721 --> 01:54.304
come to see the
great Papa Tunde.

02:15.513 --> 02:18.549
Witches of the french quarter,

02:18.550 --> 02:20.457
thank you for your welcome.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.584
It is good to be
among people of the faith.

02:22.585 --> 02:25.023
I, too, practice
ancestral magic,

02:25.024 --> 02:28.059
honoring those who walked
the path before us.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.674
From them we draw strength...

02:32.230 --> 02:34.221
And you will need strength,

02:34.222 --> 02:36.348
for a great darkness is coming.

02:36.349 --> 02:38.870
The city your forefathers
left you is now overrun

02:38.871 --> 02:41.977
by pirates, beasts,
and vampires.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.560
I practice
other magic, as well...

03:02.561 --> 03:04.000
Sacrificial magic.

03:04.001 --> 03:06.330
Channeling power
from the lives of my offerings,

03:06.331 --> 03:08.566
I use this strength
to vanquish my enemies,

03:08.567 --> 03:12.174
and I will punish your enemies
for their greed.

03:14.305 --> 03:18.841
In return, you will accept
my family into your coven...

03:21.779 --> 03:24.686
And me as your leader.

03:29.987 --> 03:33.190
Gentlemen,
make yourselves at home.

03:33.191 --> 03:35.333
Mayor O'Connell appears
to be running late,

03:35.334 --> 03:37.361
but there's much to discuss,
so I shall begin.

03:37.362 --> 03:39.896
One moment,
please, brother.

03:40.371 --> 03:41.999
You know
how much I enjoy

03:42.000 --> 03:44.267
these illicit,
little gatherings.

03:44.268 --> 03:45.836
Do not be troubled.

03:45.837 --> 03:47.738
Despite my brother's
reputation, I can assure you,

03:47.739 --> 03:49.421
we've invited you here
to broker in peace.

03:49.422 --> 03:50.974
You have my word.

03:50.975 --> 03:52.109
And, lucky for you,

03:52.110 --> 03:54.466
my brother always
keeps his word.

03:56.613 --> 04:00.583
You two are from
the guerrera crime family,

04:00.584 --> 04:03.654
a brutish pack
of thieves and killers,

04:03.655 --> 04:05.622
and that's nothing compared
to what you become

04:05.623 --> 04:07.124
on a full moon,
is it?

04:07.125 --> 04:08.258
Yes, yes, yes.

04:08.259 --> 04:09.860
Of course,
a bite from your kind

04:09.861 --> 04:11.461
is not lethal
to an original.

04:11.462 --> 04:13.630
Conflict between us
would not

04:13.631 --> 04:15.832
end well
for you at all.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.233
Let's state
our proposal here.

04:17.235 --> 04:19.451
My brother and I control
the ports of the city,

04:19.452 --> 04:21.471
but with prohibition
soon to be the law

04:21.471 --> 04:23.707
of the land, there'll be
a certain uptick

04:23.708 --> 04:27.310
in the kind of federal
presence we prefer to avoid.

04:27.311 --> 04:29.646
Therefore, I'd like
to suggest a system

04:29.647 --> 04:32.648
whereby... under our
supervision, of course...

04:32.649 --> 04:34.784
The guerrera family
can traffic alcohol

04:34.785 --> 04:36.920
into the city of
New Orleans for a profit.

04:36.921 --> 04:38.555
We would still be
in charge,

04:38.556 --> 04:42.125
but our rule would
remain a secret.

04:44.261 --> 04:46.162
This all
sounds very good,

04:46.163 --> 04:47.897
but, tell me,

04:47.898 --> 04:49.522
how will it benefit
the witches?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.633
I am sorry.
This is a private meeting.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.611
Yes, for kings
of the city,

04:54.612 --> 04:56.639
but I, too,
am a King,

04:56.640 --> 04:58.240
and I
have rules.

04:58.241 --> 05:01.143
I'm impressed.

05:01.577 --> 05:04.329
You're either quite ambitious
or quite mad.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.206
What's your name, mate?

05:06.207 --> 05:09.151
I am Alphonz
Bellatunde Delgallo,

05:09.585 --> 05:11.487
Papa Tunde
to my followers,

05:11.488 --> 05:12.922
and I come to ask
that the witches

05:12.923 --> 05:14.290
be granted
fair tribute

05:14.291 --> 05:16.339
for allowing your
existence in our city.

05:16.827 --> 05:18.628
Are you suggesting
that you speak

05:18.629 --> 05:20.595
for the french
quarter witches?

05:20.596 --> 05:22.764
I do now, and I expect

05:23.265 --> 05:25.868
our future negotiations
to go very smoothly.

05:25.869 --> 05:29.871
As a guarantee,
I brought a gift.

05:34.277 --> 05:37.485
I await our
next gathering.

05:52.061 --> 05:55.128
Well, I suppose
we'll need a new mayor.

05:57.415 --> 06:01.987
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

06:02.574 --> 06:05.641
Hey, Marcel, maybe you
know what's going on.

06:05.642 --> 06:07.610
Klaus ordered us
to meet here,

06:07.611 --> 06:08.911
and now he's
a no-show.

06:08.912 --> 06:10.479
What do you
want from me?

06:10.480 --> 06:13.730
It's a new regime.
Get used to it.

06:16.068 --> 06:19.621
Dearest brethren,
your attention, please.

06:19.622 --> 06:23.524
No doubt, you're all surprised
to see Thierry Vanchure,

06:23.525 --> 06:25.326
who's supposed to be rotting
in the garden

06:25.327 --> 06:27.363
for the crime of killing
one of our own,

06:27.364 --> 06:31.400
and I personally decided
to issue him with a pardon.

06:31.401 --> 06:35.571
I hope you'll all
welcome home Thierry.

06:35.572 --> 06:37.439
Welcome home, mate.

06:42.428 --> 06:44.946
You're in a good mood.

06:45.347 --> 06:47.182
You should visit
Mystic Falls more often.

06:47.183 --> 06:48.617
Well, as much
as I might like to,

06:48.618 --> 06:50.850
I have pressing
responsibilities here.

06:52.354 --> 06:56.524
Now, as you all know,

06:56.525 --> 06:59.293
the witch Davina
is no longer with us.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.528
Without Davina, we can
no longer monitor

07:02.065 --> 07:04.491
the activity
of our witch neighbors.

07:04.492 --> 07:08.070
However, since
their harvest failed,

07:08.071 --> 07:11.164
their magic will soon
be gone forever.

07:11.165 --> 07:14.376
Until then, I say we
keep them on their toes.

07:14.377 --> 07:18.545
Diego, I wonder
if you might lead

07:18.546 --> 07:20.338
a rousting
in the cauldron.

07:25.587 --> 07:28.932
Marcel, I'd hoped
you would join Diego.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.091
Nah.

07:32.527 --> 07:34.561
I'm gonna take
a personal day.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.025
Now,
you may doubt him.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.002
Today I saw Niklaus
demonstrate mercy

07:41.003 --> 07:42.537
towards an enemy.

07:42.538 --> 07:44.105
Tell me
that's not progress.

07:44.106 --> 07:45.573
Please, Elijah.

07:45.574 --> 07:47.342
Who do you think convinced
Klaus to let Thierry out?

07:47.343 --> 07:50.178
Why would you do
such a thing?

07:50.179 --> 07:51.880
Because, despite
Klaus' reprieve,

07:51.881 --> 07:54.315
Thierry despises him.

07:54.316 --> 07:55.583
I like that
about Thierry.

07:55.584 --> 07:56.951
I also like that he
used to date a witch,

07:56.952 --> 07:59.120
so he knows about
french quarter covens.

07:59.121 --> 08:00.455
Maybe he can lead me
to whoever

08:00.456 --> 08:01.990
stole off with
the harvest magic.

08:01.991 --> 08:03.258
Rebekah, we are
all devastated

08:03.259 --> 08:04.792
by the outcome
of this ritual.

08:04.793 --> 08:06.594
That's just it.
There was no outcome.

08:06.595 --> 08:09.864
We both know that power
like that doesn't just vanish.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.333
I say someone
stole it.

08:12.334 --> 08:13.735
I'd like to know who,

08:13.736 --> 08:15.770
and then I'd like to make
an ally out of them.

08:15.771 --> 08:19.040
To what end,
exactly?

08:19.041 --> 08:20.942
I'm tired of
being threatened

08:20.943 --> 08:22.986
and controlled by
our tyrant brother.

08:22.987 --> 08:25.346
If you want
to stop a bully,

08:25.347 --> 08:26.948
you need the power
to stand up to them.

08:26.949 --> 08:28.583
I expect such behavior
from Niklaus.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.017
It's so very disappointing
when it comes

08:30.018 --> 08:31.743
from you, Rebekah.

08:32.154 --> 08:34.020
Do you not see
that, in his way,

08:34.020 --> 08:36.123
he's making
an effort here?

08:36.124 --> 08:38.359
He's invited us back
into our family home.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.727
He yearns for our family
to be reunited.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.163
Yes. He's in a
brilliant mood now,

08:42.164 --> 08:43.254
but for how long?

08:43.765 --> 08:45.466
It's his trick, Elijah.

08:45.467 --> 08:48.002
He lulls you
into a false sense

08:48.003 --> 08:49.503
of camaraderie
and kinship,

08:49.504 --> 08:51.972
and then he turns
on you like a snake.

08:51.973 --> 08:53.240
I fall for it
every time

08:53.241 --> 08:54.575
and wind up with
a dagger in my chest

08:54.576 --> 08:55.910
for my trouble.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.344
No more.

08:57.345 --> 08:58.679
I believe that he
is approaching

08:58.680 --> 09:00.314
some semblance
of peace here.

09:00.315 --> 09:02.400
Leadership may, in fact,
be a good thing for him.

09:02.401 --> 09:04.859
Now, sister, please,
I ask you,

09:04.860 --> 09:06.520
if you cannot
support him,

09:06.521 --> 09:10.573
then at least do nothing
to provoke him.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.765
Ugh, is this
what's it's come to?

09:17.766 --> 09:19.199
I bear the full weight
of our kingdom

09:19.200 --> 09:21.000
while you pout
like a child.

09:21.001 --> 09:22.503
You wanted to be King.

09:22.504 --> 09:24.505
Besides, you look
like you guy it covered.

09:24.506 --> 09:26.507
If the men see you
shirk your duties,

09:26.508 --> 09:28.075
they're likely
to do the same.

09:28.076 --> 09:31.477
I told you, I am not in
the mood for vampire Hijinx.

09:31.478 --> 09:33.547
No. You'd rather sit
wallowing in sorrow

09:33.548 --> 09:35.115
for your lost
little friend.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.717
Don't push me
right now.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.886
I am sorry Davina
is gone, ok?

09:38.887 --> 09:40.854
I'm sorry, but this
mournful attitude

09:40.855 --> 09:44.458
is unworthy of you,
and it's boring to me.

09:44.459 --> 09:48.444
Hey, guys,
we got a problem.

09:51.732 --> 09:53.066
We came to mess
with the witches,

09:53.067 --> 09:54.968
just like you said,

09:54.969 --> 09:57.037
and these two,
they went missing,

09:57.038 --> 09:58.623
found them
like this...

09:58.624 --> 10:01.332
Not even staked,
just dead.

10:07.132 --> 10:09.648
Where are you going?

10:10.052 --> 10:11.968
Someone has to account
for this.

10:14.554 --> 10:17.473
You want revenge,
get it yourself.

10:19.059 --> 10:21.728
That Mark is tied
to some bad mojo.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.462
Any of y'all got any brains,
you'll head back

10:23.463 --> 10:25.857
to the compound and stay
the hell out of this.

10:35.008 --> 10:37.777
We're gonna find
whoever did this,

10:37.778 --> 10:41.081
and I will show them
what suffering is.

10:41.082 --> 10:43.949
Used to run things
down here for Marcel.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.318
Thought you'd like
to see what I found

10:45.319 --> 10:46.337
before Klaus did.

10:46.338 --> 10:47.987
Not a day
out of the garden,

10:47.988 --> 10:49.389
and you're already
proving yourself useful.

10:49.390 --> 10:50.508
We made a deal,

10:50.509 --> 10:52.392
and if it screws things
or your brother,

10:52.393 --> 10:54.794
I'm all for it,
though, to be honest,

10:54.795 --> 10:57.329
this stuff
makes my skin crawl.

10:57.330 --> 11:00.500
I've never seen
anything like this.

11:00.501 --> 11:02.935
I have,
a long time ago.

11:05.605 --> 11:08.359
Somebody is copycatting
a very dangerous witch.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.676
They draw their power
from sacrifice.

11:10.677 --> 11:12.445
I just don't understand
why someone

11:12.446 --> 11:15.365
would leave it here
for us to find...

11:18.317 --> 11:20.520
Unless they wanted it
to be found.

11:20.521 --> 11:22.832
Mademoiselle Mikaelson.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.690
That's not possible.

11:24.691 --> 11:28.393
Sure, it is, chere.
It's magic.

11:28.394 --> 11:31.257
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrace-toi.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.331
Embrace-toi.

11:33.844 --> 11:36.268
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrace-toi.

11:36.805 --> 11:38.179
Embrace-toi.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.206
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrace-toi.

11:40.207 --> 11:41.774
Embrace-toi.

11:41.775 --> 11:45.011
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrace-toi.

11:45.012 --> 11:46.845
Ah!

11:52.421 --> 11:53.589
Someone will die
for this.

11:53.590 --> 11:55.090
Remarkably,
I don't disagree.

11:55.091 --> 11:56.258
However, I would
like to know

11:56.259 --> 11:57.726
where they learned
such dark magic.

11:57.727 --> 12:00.429
I had hoped never to see
that symbol again.

12:00.430 --> 12:02.264
I recall it is
the signature of a fool

12:02.265 --> 12:03.898
who once stood
against us.

12:03.899 --> 12:06.902
Clearly, some upstart witch
is salvaging old tricks.

12:06.903 --> 12:09.771
I'll do for him
as I did the other.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.087
Diego.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.376
When night falls,
I want you to gather

12:14.377 --> 12:16.644
every vampire
in the quarter.

12:16.645 --> 12:19.648
Get me the head
of whoever did this

12:19.649 --> 12:21.391
and put it
on a stick.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.285
Yeah. That's gonna
be a problem.

12:23.286 --> 12:25.353
Everyone is
freaked out, man.

12:25.354 --> 12:27.089
We haven't had witches
killing vampires

12:27.090 --> 12:28.623
in a long time.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.459
Marcel made sure
of that.

12:30.460 --> 12:33.192
Marcel has run off
like a scared child.

12:35.239 --> 12:36.946
You lot are left
with me.

12:38.800 --> 12:43.438
Now, who of you

12:43.439 --> 12:46.038
will fight
to defend our home?

12:51.255 --> 12:53.480
Not a single one of you
will stand with me,

12:53.481 --> 12:56.350
so afraid are you
of this new threat?

12:58.762 --> 13:00.386
You should know better.

13:02.357 --> 13:05.433
I'll handle this myself.

13:09.898 --> 13:13.301
Sophie, the restaurant
is an epic disaster... again.

13:13.302 --> 13:15.169
Do you think maybe
you could come in today and...

13:15.170 --> 13:17.338
User's mailbox is full.
Good-bye.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.573
Looks like
I should've been

13:18.574 --> 13:19.908
here last night.

13:19.909 --> 13:21.508
Before you try anything,
I'm on vervain.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.977
Yeah. Klaus mentioned
you broke free

13:22.978 --> 13:24.076
of his compulsion.

13:24.546 --> 13:27.248
Good for you.
Sophie around?

13:27.249 --> 13:28.664
No. Why?

13:29.118 --> 13:31.334
Got a witch problem.
Thought she might have answers.

13:33.921 --> 13:36.823
Mind if I wait?

13:38.926 --> 13:41.628
It's a little early
for day drinking.

13:41.629 --> 13:44.432
Let me guess,
Klaus problems.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.533
I thought you'd be
on top of the world

13:46.977 --> 13:48.728
now that you have
Davina back.

13:48.729 --> 13:50.937
Davina is gone.

13:54.610 --> 13:55.710
Was it Klaus?

13:55.711 --> 13:57.320
I told him,
if he hurt her...

13:57.321 --> 13:59.313
It wasn't like that.

13:59.314 --> 14:01.482
The power that she
had was too much.

14:01.483 --> 14:03.184
We tried to fix her with
this crazy-ass ritual,

14:03.185 --> 14:04.552
and something
went wrong.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.220
Now she's...
I don't know...

14:06.221 --> 14:07.521
Floating in limbo

14:07.522 --> 14:09.724
or waiting
on her ancestors.

14:15.696 --> 14:19.599
Marcel...

14:19.600 --> 14:21.300
I'm sorry.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.640
Yeah. Me, too.

14:32.856 --> 14:35.715
There you are.

14:35.716 --> 14:38.150
Here I am.

14:40.554 --> 14:43.241
Davina's drawings.

14:43.242 --> 14:46.093
Yeah. Morbid, I know.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.061
I was just thinking,
we never figured out

14:48.062 --> 14:51.165
why she drew those
pictures of Celeste.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.599
Anyway, I'm just
killing time

14:52.600 --> 14:54.635
now that I'm on
vampire lockdown.

14:54.636 --> 14:56.270
Whoever did this,
we will deal with them.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.671
It won't be long.

14:57.672 --> 15:00.007
I'm not worried.

15:00.008 --> 15:01.241
Just think
it's kind of funny

15:01.242 --> 15:03.277
that it took some big,
supernatural threat

15:03.278 --> 15:06.279
for you to even come
into the same room as me.

15:09.017 --> 15:11.559
I do apologize
if you feel neglected.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.819
I have been occupied.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.489
My siblings
are in some quarrel.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.089
Niklaus remains
agitated.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.609
You'll recall that even
our slightest interactions

15:20.061 --> 15:24.430
seem to...
Infuriate him.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.934
So Klaus is a dick,

15:27.935 --> 15:30.537
and you want to be
a good big brother.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.974
So we can't
hang out.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.475
That sum it up?

15:40.380 --> 15:42.148
I get it, Elijah.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.009
It just seems like a
really crappy deal.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.728
El presidente?

15:56.097 --> 15:58.606
He likes to keep track
of his people.

15:58.607 --> 16:01.300
Why are you loyal
to him, exactly?

16:01.301 --> 16:03.169
For someone who says
she can't stand the guy,

16:03.170 --> 16:05.471
you sure ask a lot
of questions about him.

16:05.472 --> 16:08.974
My interest
is purely academic.

16:08.975 --> 16:11.110
I know what
you're doing.

16:11.111 --> 16:12.679
You're mad he used you,

16:12.680 --> 16:14.581
and you want
to get back at him.

16:14.582 --> 16:15.682
Maybe you're hoping
I'll let slip

16:15.683 --> 16:16.918
some chink
in his armor.

16:16.919 --> 16:18.751
Friendly advice...
Don't do that.

16:19.286 --> 16:21.320
It won't end well.

16:25.302 --> 16:27.894
Let me tell you
a story about someone

16:27.895 --> 16:29.529
who went up
against Klaus.

16:31.899 --> 16:33.599
This was right after I returned

16:33.600 --> 16:35.735
from world war I.

16:35.736 --> 16:39.571
I'd been trying to get away
from New Orleans for a while.

16:46.045 --> 16:47.780
Something kept drawing me back.

16:52.351 --> 16:53.586
Why don't you get me
some Martinis?

16:53.587 --> 16:55.621
Thank you.

16:59.959 --> 17:02.127
Aren't you gonna
welcome me home?

17:02.128 --> 17:03.329
I wouldn't
want you to think

17:03.330 --> 17:04.924
that I was happy
to see you.

17:04.925 --> 17:07.050
How long
you gonna hate me?

17:07.051 --> 17:09.401
You left me in a box
for 52 years.

17:09.402 --> 17:12.807
Twice that seems
like a good start.

17:12.808 --> 17:15.974
Come on, boys.

17:19.744 --> 17:22.146
There he is...

17:22.147 --> 17:25.584
Our war hero
triumphantly returned.

17:25.585 --> 17:27.886
Oh, good to have you
back, Marcellus.

17:27.887 --> 17:29.280
Welcome home.

17:33.537 --> 17:36.295
Mm. Ha ha!

17:36.296 --> 17:39.063
The prodigal son has finally
learned to hold his liquor.

17:39.064 --> 17:40.799
The army'll
do that to you.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.100
Well, it's good
to have you back.

17:42.101 --> 17:44.503
Niklaus was beside himself
in your absence.

17:44.504 --> 17:46.438
Now that you are here,

17:46.439 --> 17:48.551
perhaps you could help
settle an argument.

17:48.552 --> 17:50.509
You see, you've traded
a war abroad

17:50.977 --> 17:53.244
for one here
in the quarter.

17:53.245 --> 17:57.115
Some rogue witch wants a piece
of the city we built,

17:57.116 --> 18:01.086
and Elijah, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

18:01.087 --> 18:04.656
insists that negotiation
is our best recourse.

18:04.657 --> 18:06.792
Yes. On the topic of
your failed comprehension,

18:06.793 --> 18:08.794
you neglect,
as a soldier,

18:08.795 --> 18:10.228
Marcel has seen
not only

18:10.229 --> 18:11.864
how small
the world has become

18:11.865 --> 18:13.298
and how fast
news can travel,

18:13.299 --> 18:15.953
but also the very
horrors of war itself.

18:15.954 --> 18:18.002
Surely, Marcel
would agree with me.

18:18.003 --> 18:20.138
The best way for us
to defend our home

18:20.139 --> 18:23.240
is by exercising
discretion.

18:23.241 --> 18:25.342
So who's the witch
you want to kill?

18:25.343 --> 18:28.013
His name is Papa Tunde.

18:28.014 --> 18:31.509
I think
he's a charlatan.

18:33.018 --> 18:35.120
Well, Marcel
shall be able

18:35.121 --> 18:37.855
to decide that
for himself.

18:40.437 --> 18:42.060
You invited him
here.

18:42.061 --> 18:45.314
Of course.
We're not savages, are we?

18:49.196 --> 18:54.038
Thank you for accepting
our invitation, and welcome.

18:54.039 --> 18:56.492
I hope you'll allow me
to play the role of host.

18:56.493 --> 18:58.160
If there's
anything you need...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.041
Anything at all...

19:07.505 --> 19:09.654
Pleasure before
business, then.

19:09.655 --> 19:10.840
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

19:13.358 --> 19:15.221
I didn't get it at first.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.462
Klaus was the one
who wanted to go to war.

19:18.463 --> 19:21.798
So why was he inviting
his enemy into his home?

19:21.799 --> 19:25.303
Why be so generous to someone
who he's gonna have to kill?

19:25.304 --> 19:28.232
But, you see, that's the thing.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.008
It was all part of Klaus' plan.

19:31.009 --> 19:32.810
He was sussing
the guy out,

19:32.811 --> 19:34.879
learning his weaknesses,
his strengths,

19:34.880 --> 19:36.991
getting him to let
his guard down.

19:37.416 --> 19:39.350
That's how Klaus
does it.

19:39.351 --> 19:41.886
Then he goes in
for the kill.

19:41.887 --> 19:45.089
Because he's
a two-faced sociopath.

19:45.090 --> 19:47.558
There's nothing enviable
about what Klaus does.

19:47.559 --> 19:49.627
He's a monster.

19:49.628 --> 19:51.629
We're all
monsters, Cami.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.064
If you're powerful
like Klaus is,

19:53.065 --> 19:55.266
you just don't have
to bother hiding it.

19:55.267 --> 19:58.769
Davina was powerful.

19:58.770 --> 20:01.471
She wasn't a monster.

20:37.841 --> 20:41.096
It is done.

20:41.097 --> 20:43.814
The power of the original
sister flows through me.

20:43.815 --> 20:46.395
And will that be enough
to make Klaus suffer?

20:46.396 --> 20:49.286
I will hurt Klaus Mikaelson
as he hurt me.

20:49.287 --> 20:51.255
When I am done,

20:51.256 --> 20:54.857
he will wish
that he could die.

21:04.094 --> 21:06.163
You gonna open
this place today?

21:06.564 --> 21:08.751
And risk you eating
the clientele?

21:08.752 --> 21:10.233
Oh, and here
I thought

21:10.234 --> 21:12.435
you were starting
to like me again.

21:20.555 --> 21:22.612
Ah, you've deigned
to break your despair

21:22.613 --> 21:23.947
long enough to
pick up the phone.

21:23.948 --> 21:25.315
I figured you'd
just keep calling.

21:25.316 --> 21:26.582
I'm in
the cauldron now.

21:26.583 --> 21:27.918
You could meet me here.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.187
We could start burning
passersby at the stake.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.942
Sorry. I'm gonna
chase down my own lead.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.325
And where
might that be,

21:35.326 --> 21:37.026
the bottom of
a bottle of scotch?

21:37.027 --> 21:39.094
I'm at
Sophie Deveraux's place.

21:39.095 --> 21:42.032
I figured I'll sit here
and drink till she shows.

21:42.033 --> 21:44.067
Or you could snap
out of this funk

21:44.068 --> 21:46.502
and come and
help me end this.

21:53.588 --> 21:57.346
Big, bad
Klaus Mikaelson.

21:59.636 --> 22:02.012
Sophie.

22:02.013 --> 22:05.287
Just the witch I was
looking to brutalize.

22:05.809 --> 22:08.223
Perhaps you could explain
the attacks on my men.

22:13.997 --> 22:16.299
Rebekah is not
answering her calls.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.234
You worried about whoever
killed those daywalkers

22:18.235 --> 22:19.769
still being out there?

22:19.770 --> 22:20.870
Frankly, I'm
worried that she

22:20.871 --> 22:22.972
had something
to do with this.

22:22.973 --> 22:25.369
She's very displeased
with Niklaus,

22:25.370 --> 22:29.790
perhaps even
conspiring

22:29.791 --> 22:31.848
with others.

22:31.849 --> 22:34.983
Thierry, is it?

22:36.185 --> 22:38.019
That's right.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.050
My sister
is rather fond of you.

22:40.051 --> 22:43.558
Strange, she's not typically
drawn to unremarkable men.

22:43.559 --> 22:48.017
Would you care to explain
your sudden magnetism?

22:48.018 --> 22:50.894
I don't know
what you're...

22:50.895 --> 22:53.687
You can either
tell me what you know

22:53.688 --> 22:56.732
or I can distribute tiny pieces
of you throughout the quarter.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.903
She asked me to keep an
eye out on witch stuff.

22:59.904 --> 23:02.044
I found something,
and when I showed her,

23:02.045 --> 23:04.046
we were jumped
by some guy.

23:04.047 --> 23:06.815
He desiccated her
with his touch.

23:06.816 --> 23:09.985
Like a coward,
you left her.

23:09.986 --> 23:11.353
What was I
supposed to do,

23:11.354 --> 23:13.500
fight some warlock that
took out an original?

23:13.501 --> 23:15.825
Where was this,
exactly?

23:15.826 --> 23:18.761
The docks,
warehouse 57.

23:18.762 --> 23:20.674
I was just doing
what she asked.

23:20.675 --> 23:22.964
You cannot tell
Klaus about this.

23:27.348 --> 23:30.390
I shall take that
into consideration.

23:30.391 --> 23:31.518
I'm coming with you.

23:31.519 --> 23:34.276
No. Stay here.
Compound is safe.

23:34.277 --> 23:36.210
Rebekah is in trouble.
I'm going.

23:39.319 --> 23:42.483
Do not leave my sight.
Understand?

23:44.115 --> 23:47.055
Me calling things
off with you

23:47.056 --> 23:49.370
wasn't lack
of interest.

23:49.371 --> 23:53.461
I was hoping to save you
from all this.

23:55.264 --> 23:59.463
Well, thanks, Romeo,
but I'm in it.

23:59.464 --> 24:01.970
So when are you gonna
get to the good part

24:01.971 --> 24:04.259
with Klaus
and that Papa guy?

24:04.260 --> 24:07.209
Papa Tunde said he wanted
to empower the witches.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.878
Mostly, he wanted
money and territory.

24:09.879 --> 24:11.980
Klaus and Elijah weren't
about to give him either.

24:11.981 --> 24:14.983
He didn't like that,
so he went on a rampage.

24:14.984 --> 24:17.152
No one was safe...

24:19.655 --> 24:21.695
Not the humans in the faction...

24:25.698 --> 24:27.428
Not the guerrero werewolves.

24:30.995 --> 24:35.497
He even went after the witches
who opposed him.

24:36.371 --> 24:38.840
Elijah offered a truce...

24:38.841 --> 24:40.675
He gave his word, in fact...

24:40.676 --> 24:45.046
But Klaus, being Klaus,
he had another idea.

24:45.047 --> 24:46.548
You're late, Elijah.

24:46.549 --> 24:47.816
It's not like
the noble brother

24:47.817 --> 24:49.050
to keep me waiting.

24:49.051 --> 24:50.819
I'm sorry, mate.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.253
Elijah is
the brother you meet

24:52.254 --> 24:54.622
when negotiations
are to be had.

24:54.623 --> 24:58.230
I'm the one you get when
negotiations are closed.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.761
You do not scare me.

24:59.762 --> 25:01.596
You have no idea
the power I possess.

25:01.597 --> 25:03.264
Oh, in fact, I made
it a point to learn

25:03.265 --> 25:05.499
all about
your power.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.968
I noticed how you're
almost always near

25:06.969 --> 25:08.635
those twin sons
of yours,

25:08.636 --> 25:11.005
how they bear your
distinctive Mark.

25:11.006 --> 25:13.707
Got me to thinking.

25:13.708 --> 25:16.711
You channel their
power, don't you,

25:16.712 --> 25:19.180
which, of course,
begs the question,

25:19.181 --> 25:20.548
what would happen
were that power

25:20.549 --> 25:23.384
to be taken away,
if those sons

25:23.385 --> 25:25.853
whose lives
you depend on

25:25.854 --> 25:30.924
were suddenly
struck down?

25:37.604 --> 25:41.188
What of that power
then?

25:47.780 --> 25:50.578
I will kill you
for this.

25:50.579 --> 25:53.869
I cannot be killed.

25:53.870 --> 25:55.120
You, however...

25:55.121 --> 25:57.664
Aagh!

25:57.665 --> 26:00.087
That's horrible.

26:00.088 --> 26:02.122
Oh, to Klaus,
it's just business.

26:03.657 --> 26:05.226
And don't you think
there's something

26:05.227 --> 26:06.965
fundamentally wrong
with that?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.590
Don't you worry
you'll end up

26:09.064 --> 26:11.698
one of his victims or,
worse, just like him?

26:13.300 --> 26:16.469
Poor Marcellus.

26:18.005 --> 26:22.375
You remains always in
the shadow of your father.

26:22.857 --> 26:25.111
Climb out from
beneath it, will you,

26:25.112 --> 26:27.480
so you can die
like a man?

26:34.512 --> 26:36.410
Cami, you need
to run now.

26:36.883 --> 26:38.183
Don't look back.
Just go.

26:38.184 --> 26:39.484
I think
she should stay.

26:39.485 --> 26:41.119
I prefer an audience,
and I'm about

26:41.120 --> 26:43.088
to put on
quite the show.

26:48.828 --> 26:49.861
Marcel?

26:49.862 --> 26:52.597
I said,
get out of here.

26:52.598 --> 26:55.387
You cannot defeat me.

26:55.388 --> 26:57.569
I channel the power
of an original vampire.

26:57.570 --> 27:01.727
Soon, I will have all 3,
but first, I will take you.

27:19.924 --> 27:22.165
It's a complex spell,

27:22.166 --> 27:25.168
old-school stuff rooted
in sacrificial magic.

27:25.169 --> 27:28.754
Whoever did this
to your guys, my guess is,

27:28.755 --> 27:31.133
they were an offering
to gain more power.

27:31.134 --> 27:34.177
More guys they kill,
more power they get.

27:38.944 --> 27:42.267
I didn't expect
a call from you so soon.

27:42.268 --> 27:43.915
You need to get to
Rousseau's now.

27:43.916 --> 27:46.783
Some lunatic witch doctor
is killing Marcel.

27:46.784 --> 27:48.985
Get as far away
from there as you can.

27:53.557 --> 27:55.192
Rebekah.

27:55.193 --> 27:57.594
Oh...

27:57.595 --> 27:59.629
What's happening?

28:00.531 --> 28:04.623
Some kind
of boundary spell.

28:04.624 --> 28:06.470
Someone is
channeling her.

28:06.471 --> 28:08.105
Typically, it's
a lethal process,

28:08.106 --> 28:10.170
but, because she's
an original, she cannot die.

28:12.109 --> 28:13.877
Instead, she's an endless
source of power.

28:13.878 --> 28:16.146
So what are we
supposed to do?

28:17.381 --> 28:19.513
You have to get her
out of there.

28:20.985 --> 28:23.654
As I recall, you're
one of the few people

28:23.655 --> 28:27.020
Niklaus Mikaelson
ever gave a damn about.

28:28.158 --> 28:30.607
You know what he did
to my family.

28:31.861 --> 28:33.568
Aah!

28:35.833 --> 28:39.737
The sins of the father
are paid for by the son.

28:39.738 --> 28:44.441
I will take pleasure
in telling Klaus how you died.

28:44.442 --> 28:47.791
I remember killing you.
I rather relished it.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.293
What a joy it is to
relive fond memories.

28:53.283 --> 28:56.253
You're here. Good.

28:56.254 --> 28:59.289
I can crush you before
the eyes of your son,

28:59.290 --> 29:02.180
then I will
consume you both.

29:06.630 --> 29:10.199
This time,
I'm stronger.

29:13.336 --> 29:15.972
You're not listening.
We cannot enter the circle.

29:15.973 --> 29:18.407
There's some kind
of confinement spell or...

29:18.408 --> 29:20.544
If I can't remove her,
we can't break the link.

29:20.545 --> 29:22.179
It's a convoluted spell.

29:22.180 --> 29:23.814
It's like
a witch's recipe.

29:23.815 --> 29:25.215
You can spoil
the balance by adding

29:25.216 --> 29:26.583
a more potent
ingredient,

29:26.584 --> 29:28.251
a mystical binding
agent... I don't know...

29:28.252 --> 29:30.386
Volcanic ash, rock salt,

29:30.795 --> 29:32.796
anything up to and
including eye of newt.

29:32.797 --> 29:34.791
What about the blood
of a witch?

29:34.792 --> 29:36.591
Do you have the
blood of a witch?

29:42.599 --> 29:45.168
I need a favor.

29:45.169 --> 29:47.937
The baby.

29:47.938 --> 29:50.562
She's a quarter
witch.

30:05.788 --> 30:07.162
Uh!

30:56.806 --> 30:59.341
Is he dead?
Get out of here.

30:59.342 --> 31:01.426
Is Marcel dead?
Did that guy kill him?

31:01.427 --> 31:04.280
He didn't finish him off.
Marcel needs blood to heal.

31:04.281 --> 31:06.415
Go. Find me someone
off the street.

31:06.416 --> 31:09.017
I'll do it.
No.

31:09.018 --> 31:10.853
Not you.

31:10.854 --> 31:13.122
I don't want you
involved in this.

31:13.123 --> 31:17.482
You don't control me
anymore, remember?

31:22.698 --> 31:24.632
It's ok, Marcel.

31:26.068 --> 31:29.838
It's ok.
It's ok, Marcel.

31:56.649 --> 31:57.940
Ah!

31:57.941 --> 31:59.975
I should rip out
your coward heart.

31:59.976 --> 32:01.377
What, Rebekah?

32:01.378 --> 32:03.012
We made a deal
to take out your brother,

32:03.013 --> 32:05.247
but at he end of the day,
it's every man for himself.

32:05.248 --> 32:09.285
I am so sick
of self-serving narcissists.

32:09.286 --> 32:12.621
Are men simply incapable
of committing to an alliance?

32:12.622 --> 32:14.489
Oh...

32:17.294 --> 32:19.762
I asked you to cease
these petty moves

32:19.763 --> 32:22.097
against our family,
and yet you conspire

32:22.098 --> 32:24.099
with this fool.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.601
Is this
what its come to,

32:25.602 --> 32:27.345
making moves against
your own blood?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.438
Don't you try
and shame me.

32:29.439 --> 32:31.006
Nik grows more powerful
by the day,

32:31.007 --> 32:32.574
and you do nothing
but encourage him.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.243
I offer him my counsel
because it's clear to me

32:34.244 --> 32:36.644
that he needs to make
the city our home.

32:36.645 --> 32:40.849
Now, perhaps leading
these... derelicts

32:40.850 --> 32:42.918
will curb some
of these impulses,

32:42.919 --> 32:44.613
Grant him some
degree of happiness.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.621
You always talk
of Nik's happiness.

32:46.622 --> 32:48.256
Over 1,000 years,
he has robbed me

32:48.257 --> 32:50.410
of any chance
at my own.

32:50.411 --> 32:53.161
What about me, Elijah?

32:53.162 --> 32:54.762
Am I not a concern
for you?

32:54.763 --> 32:56.431
We all make sacrifices
in the name

32:56.432 --> 32:58.033
of this family, Rebekah,
but know this.

32:58.034 --> 33:01.503
I will never stand
against you or Niklaus.

33:01.504 --> 33:04.005
What about Hayley?

33:04.006 --> 33:06.808
Nothing I conspire to do,
none of my treachery

33:06.809 --> 33:10.044
will harm this family as much
as your feelings for her.

33:11.849 --> 33:15.383
You're a hypocrite,
Elijah.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.352
You would choose love
over family

33:17.353 --> 33:20.154
and then condemn me
for doing the same.

33:34.402 --> 33:36.873
Fancy meeting
you here.

33:36.874 --> 33:40.541
That symbol is already
up and down the cauldron,

33:41.003 --> 33:42.712
more of them
popping up everywhere.

33:42.713 --> 33:46.673
I suppose Papa Tunde
is marking his territory.

33:46.674 --> 33:48.515
I'm told you
saw him, as well.

33:48.516 --> 33:50.251
Yeah.

33:50.252 --> 33:53.254
Brought up a lot
of memories.

33:53.255 --> 33:55.390
Memories that are
best left buried.

34:17.512 --> 34:19.446
You're sauced.

34:24.045 --> 34:27.221
Celebrating Klaus' defeat
of the mad Papa Tunde?

34:27.222 --> 34:30.123
Not celebrating,
drowning sorrows.

34:34.762 --> 34:39.399
I'm the one who
brought Tunde to town.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.527
What?

34:47.527 --> 34:49.737
I made some inquiries
while I was abroad,

34:49.739 --> 34:52.612
wanted the most dangerous
witch anyone could find.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.581
Why on earth
would you do that?

34:54.583 --> 34:56.650
For you.

34:56.650 --> 34:59.453
I figured if someone
as bad as Tunde comes in,

34:59.454 --> 35:02.656
maybe Klaus
gets chased off.

35:02.657 --> 35:05.259
Very least, he's occupied
enough that he can't stop me

35:05.260 --> 35:07.327
fr trying
to get you back.

35:09.296 --> 35:11.632
You mean to tell me
that you would tear down

35:11.633 --> 35:13.386
everything
my family built,

35:13.387 --> 35:15.601
everything
you helped us build,

35:15.602 --> 35:18.439
risk your own life

35:18.440 --> 35:20.808
on the off chance
that I would show you

35:20.809 --> 35:23.342
the slightest bit
of affection?

35:24.845 --> 35:26.379
I would.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.282
I did.

35:31.752 --> 35:34.554
I'd do it again.

35:37.858 --> 35:40.960
Klaus has killed
a thousand tundes.

35:40.961 --> 35:42.496
All his life,
there's only ever been

35:42.497 --> 35:44.630
one man he has
truly feared...

35:44.631 --> 35:47.545
My father Mikael.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.839
The vampire
who hunts vampires.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.371
If he came here,

35:51.372 --> 35:53.572
Klaus would flee
and never turn back.

35:55.930 --> 35:57.810
All we need
is a witch

35:57.811 --> 36:00.412
who can help us
find him.

37:03.510 --> 37:08.314
Not long ago,
you all united against me.

37:09.878 --> 37:11.421
You failed.

37:11.422 --> 37:16.456
Since then, in my benevolence,
I have wiped the Slate clean,

37:16.457 --> 37:20.060
yet it seems clear you think
that I am the one

37:20.061 --> 37:24.184
who needs to earn your respect,
your loyalty.

37:24.185 --> 37:25.560
You're mistaken.

37:25.561 --> 37:29.856
It is you who must
prove yourselves to me.

37:29.857 --> 37:35.908
Our community is under attack.
I require soldiers.

37:35.909 --> 37:40.679
I need warriors, not cowards.

37:43.704 --> 37:46.153
Each of you has
a decision to make.

37:46.154 --> 37:49.522
You either fight alongside me

37:49.523 --> 37:53.920
or you leave... now.

38:05.071 --> 38:09.312
We don't owe you anything.

38:09.313 --> 38:12.857
If staying in the quarter means
living under your rule,

38:12.858 --> 38:15.858
I'd just as soon
get the hell out.

38:51.184 --> 38:52.689
I got to admit,

38:52.690 --> 38:54.987
I thought you'd lose
a lot more guys than that.

38:54.988 --> 38:56.989
Well, good riddance
to them, I say.

38:56.990 --> 38:58.858
We've no room for
slackers of cowards

38:58.859 --> 39:01.226
in our kingdom.

39:04.077 --> 39:06.578
Now that you've
regained your composure,

39:06.579 --> 39:08.281
let's move on
to the next item

39:08.282 --> 39:10.082
of business,
shall we,

39:10.083 --> 39:15.087
with a little help from
our dear friend Sophie.

39:15.088 --> 39:17.323
I got no reason
to help you,

39:17.324 --> 39:19.091
and I sure as hell don't have
a reason to help him.

39:19.092 --> 39:21.467
Now, now,
don't be difficult, luv.

39:21.468 --> 39:23.729
You'll only live as long
as you're of use to me,

39:23.730 --> 39:25.665
and right now,
your best use is to explain

39:25.666 --> 39:28.067
why a witch I killed
100 years ago

39:28.068 --> 39:30.503
has come back
for revenge.

39:30.504 --> 39:31.837
Come on.

39:31.838 --> 39:35.732
Resurrected witches
with vast power?

39:35.733 --> 39:37.276
It's the harvest.

39:37.277 --> 39:40.345
4 girls were meant
to die and be reborn.

39:40.346 --> 39:41.747
I don't know how,

39:41.748 --> 39:43.649
but someone
jacked that power,

39:43.650 --> 39:47.153
and they used it
to bring back 4 witches,

39:47.154 --> 39:49.245
just not
the right ones.

39:49.246 --> 39:51.622
So there's still
a chance.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.360
If we can get that power back,
we can save Davina.

39:54.361 --> 39:55.527
Let's concentrate

39:55.528 --> 39:56.862
on the immediate
problem, shall we?

39:56.863 --> 39:59.754
Papa Tunde
wants revenge.

39:59.755 --> 40:01.333
He'll continue
to attack us,

40:01.334 --> 40:03.769
channeling power from
the vampires he sacrifices.

40:03.770 --> 40:06.372
He kills, he grows
more dangerous.

40:06.373 --> 40:09.599
So how do I end him?

40:09.600 --> 40:12.518
He needs sacrifices
to gain power.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.378
Hmm.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.515
You keep him from killing
any more nightwalkers,

40:16.516 --> 40:17.899
that's a start.

40:17.900 --> 40:22.287
Unless... he finds
the one place

40:22.288 --> 40:26.692
with a load of vampires
ready to be sacrificed.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.754
Is it done?

41:00.592 --> 41:03.195
This blade now contains
all the power

41:03.196 --> 41:04.902
I harvested
from the vampires.

41:05.398 --> 41:07.532
It will do things
worse than death,

41:07.533 --> 41:09.949
even to an original.

41:13.371 --> 41:16.174
And are you ready
for the final offering?

41:16.175 --> 41:19.502
In the name of the witches
of the french quarter,

41:19.503 --> 41:22.503
it is my honor.

41:35.269 --> 41:38.262
Thank you, Papa Tunde.

41:58.535 --> 42:03.229
