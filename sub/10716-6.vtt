WEBVTT

00:25.560 --> 00:27.061
Morning.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.263
Did you sleep?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.132
A little.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.266
I made some eggs.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.505
I spoke to
my lieutenant.

00:37.572 --> 00:39.107
You can come to work
with me today.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.942
Help out.

00:41.009 --> 00:42.944
And do what?

00:43.011 --> 00:47.515
Kick down doors,
join SWAT, grab up
some bad guys.

00:47.582 --> 00:49.017
Seriously.

00:49.083 --> 00:53.722
Answer phones,
get coffee, make copies.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.590
Lieutenant Billets'
daughter's doing it, too.

00:55.657 --> 00:58.760
And you'll get to
keep an eye on me
all day at the station.

00:58.827 --> 01:01.229
I'm not even gonna be there
most of the day.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.931
If you don't want to,

01:02.997 --> 01:05.934
your mom can keep an eye
on you here all day.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.870
- Is it okay with Mom?
- I ran it by her last night.

01:08.937 --> 01:10.004
Okay.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.309
Mom says
I should have counseling.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.079
Yeah-huh.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.313
Well, we'll see
how you're feelin'

01:19.380 --> 01:20.649
in a couple of days,
right?

01:23.151 --> 01:25.186
But you gotta eat.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.789
No cop goes to work
on an empty stomach.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.661
You should make yourself
some toast, too.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.445
Ugh, what is it
about L.A.?

01:51.512 --> 01:55.116
Is it the air
or the light?

01:55.183 --> 01:58.086
The way the city
goes on and on.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.354
It can
make you feel so lost.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.398
I didn't know what was gonna
happen to Maddie.

02:13.367 --> 02:17.105
If they were gonna hurt her,
how they were gonna hurt her.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.607
- I felt so helpless.
- Me, too.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.843
- I was terrified.
- So was I.

02:24.112 --> 02:25.714
I keep kickin' myself
in the ass

02:25.714 --> 02:27.782
for not anticipating
Marks' move.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.820
I should have
protected you.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.587
You can't protect us
all the time.

02:33.722 --> 02:36.190
Oh, yeah?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.225
Why not?

02:39.060 --> 02:42.096
Something needs to change,
Harry.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.734
This life,
the way we're living.

02:45.734 --> 02:48.136
I can't help
but think that...

02:48.202 --> 02:49.838
something like this
was bound to happen.

02:49.904 --> 02:50.972
Well, that's not on you,
Eleanor,

02:51.039 --> 02:52.640
that's on Joey Marks.

02:52.741 --> 02:54.008
What we do,
Reggie and I,

02:54.075 --> 02:56.644
it puts us in contact
with people like Marks.

02:56.745 --> 02:57.979
It's his neighborhood
that we live in,

02:58.046 --> 02:59.781
and that puts
Maddie at risk.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.352
Have you spoken to Reggie?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.386
Not yet.

03:07.822 --> 03:09.958
I don't know if I...

03:10.024 --> 03:12.894
will-- what--
what would I say,
I mean--

03:12.961 --> 03:15.396
He needs to know,
Eleanor.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.431
Yeah, I guess so.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.436
Okay. Gotta go.

03:25.974 --> 03:27.776
Remember where
the weapons are, right?

03:27.809 --> 03:31.045
Record cabinet,
bedroom closet.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.797
**

04:07.048 --> 04:09.550

that I can't let go *

04:09.617 --> 04:12.286

04:45.319 --> 04:47.856
Bosch. Shouldn't a
dangerous suspect like that

04:47.856 --> 04:49.423
- be in cuffs?
- Hey, guys.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.458
Meet my daughter
Maddie.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.860
Oh, that was my
first guess,

04:51.893 --> 04:53.694
then I thought, no,
way too good looking.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.597
Detectives Johnson
and Moore,

04:56.664 --> 04:58.132
AKA Crate and Barrel.

04:58.199 --> 05:00.334
- Crate and Barrel?
- Guess which is which.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.203
Maddie's here helping out
a couple of days.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.504
Oh, really?
Finally, a Bosch

05:03.571 --> 05:04.738
who knows something
about police work.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.608
There's people you can
learn from here.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.010
These two, not so much.

05:09.077 --> 05:10.778
Good to have you here,
Maddie.

05:10.879 --> 05:12.713
- Yeah, second that.
- Thanks.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.082
Hey, Maddie.
Welcome.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.717
- Hi, Jerry.
- Don't talk to that guy.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.319
Hey, Lis, this is
my daughter Maddie.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.553
Oh, my mom said
you were coming in.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.889
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:20.922 --> 05:22.790
So, I have some,
like, shredding to do.

05:22.891 --> 05:25.159
Sure, let's do it.

05:25.226 --> 05:26.895
Hey.

05:26.895 --> 05:28.496
Hey.
How's she doin'?

05:28.562 --> 05:29.964
According to her, okay.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.299
All right,
how about Eleanor?

05:31.365 --> 05:33.634
Eleanor is taking a long,
hard look at her life.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.304
Well, being a kidnap
will do that to a gal.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.771
Anything else I can do,
let me know.

05:37.906 --> 05:39.473
Thank you.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.774
Jerry, what's new?

05:40.909 --> 05:42.210
Layla's visa app.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.678
Lilliet Saroyan
entered the country

05:44.745 --> 05:46.314
four years ago at 22.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.150
Single, no relatives
in the U.S.

05:49.217 --> 05:51.119
tourism.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.586
You need a sponsor
to get a visa.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.455
Check out the person/entity
paying for her trip.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.025
Marina Oresh,
North Kingsley Avenue,
East Hollywood.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.359
- That'd be
Little Armenia.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.761
Listed Oresh has
a U.S. contact, too.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.030
Maybe they've
kept in touch.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.032
Maybe.
Bosch.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.435
When and where?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.736
On our way.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.772
Ho-ho. D.A.'s office.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.441
Rykoff's lawyer
wants to deal.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.109
One night in county,
he's ready to flip.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.378
- Wouldn't you?
- Hell, yeah.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.712
What took him so long?

06:18.779 --> 06:19.948
Maddie.

06:23.985 --> 06:25.954
Main 9-3-2-4,
report to infirmary.

06:25.954 --> 06:27.588
The clinic?

06:27.655 --> 06:30.524
So the rest of the jail
doesn't know Rykoff's talking.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.335
- He's at room B.
- Thanks.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.586
What the hell's this?
Where's his lawyer?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.621
- He doesn't need a lawyer.
- Since when?

07:00.688 --> 07:03.257
Since he's a federal agent
and he's committed no crime.

07:03.324 --> 07:04.892
- You're shittin' me.
- Told you, Bosch.

07:04.993 --> 07:06.460
You had the wrong guy.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.462
You planted a gun
on the wrong man,
detective.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.732
- Fuck you!
- You planted a gun
on the wrong man.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.002
- He's our
undercover agent.
- Task force.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.470
You compromised him
and our whole operation.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.805
I did not plant the gun.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.007
If you didn't,
who did?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.441
I don't fuckin' know
who did.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.044
And I don't give a shit
if he's a federal agent.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.313
We found the murder weapon
in his house.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.415
We have his prints
on our victim.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.217
And you gave us
his travel records,

07:29.283 --> 07:31.352
which put him in L.A.
the night of.

07:37.158 --> 07:41.029
Oh. Beautiful.
Fuckin' records are phony.

07:41.029 --> 07:42.896
We needed to get him
back here in one piece

07:43.031 --> 07:44.665
after you fucked up
our operation.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.435
- Let's everybody
just calm down.
- Who the hell are you?

07:47.501 --> 07:49.470
I'm the guy
who's gonna tell you
how this thing plays out.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.039
Let's hear it.

07:51.039 --> 07:54.108
Mr. Rykoff's been undercover
with the Marks organization,

07:54.175 --> 07:56.210
a trusted asset
and a vital liaison

07:56.277 --> 07:58.179
between Marks and
his Russian associates.

07:58.246 --> 08:01.049
The Russians bring dope
and women into the U.S.

08:01.049 --> 08:02.850
through cartel
border tunnels,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.085
send cash and guns south.

08:04.152 --> 08:05.786
They do business
with the cartels,

08:05.853 --> 08:07.755
and the cartels do business
with the terrorists.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.390
And any day now,
these tunnels will be used

08:09.457 --> 08:10.824
to move explosives
and terrorists

08:10.891 --> 08:12.160
into this country.

08:12.226 --> 08:15.129
ISIS and Al Qaeda
here on American soil.

08:15.196 --> 08:17.431
- You get the picture?
- Yeah, yeah,
I get the picture.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.932
Why didn't you tell me
who you were,

08:19.067 --> 08:19.967
what the deal was?

08:20.068 --> 08:21.569
I was undercover.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.305
You found a gun in my house
that I didn't put there.

08:24.372 --> 08:25.706
I don't break cover
for dirty cops.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.575
- You callin' me dirty?
- Prove you're not.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.078
Fuck you, Rykoff.
And what is your
real name, anyway?

08:30.111 --> 08:31.379
Man, I ain't
tellin' you shit.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.646
We're not gonna
tell you that.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.083
It is crucial that
Marks continues to believe

08:35.116 --> 08:37.785
that Rykoff is
who he thinks he is.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.087
You're keeping him under?

08:39.153 --> 08:40.688
Yeah.
I like being lucky.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.523
Suits me.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.858
Marks gets a hint
that we've infiltrated
his organization,

08:44.925 --> 08:46.327
he will
shut everything down,

08:46.394 --> 08:47.628
and cauterize the problem.
He's done it before.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.597
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.099
At the arraignment,

08:51.099 --> 08:52.233
Rykoff's attorney will
alert the judge to

08:52.300 --> 08:53.801
a fault in the
search warrant.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.237
The judge'll toss the gun,
he'll dismiss the charges,

08:56.304 --> 08:57.638
Rykoff will be released.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.607
What about us? We have a
homicide investigation here.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.109
Right. You go about
your business.

09:01.175 --> 09:02.610
Just make sure you
stay away from ours.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.012
And provide us with
a play-by-play.

09:05.113 --> 09:07.415
So we know what the fuck
you clowns are up to.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.750
Harry.
Come on, let's go.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.455
Daily reports,
gentlemen.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.930
Hey. You want to go to
Pechanga this weekend,

09:22.996 --> 09:25.166
play some blackjack?
You know, celebrate.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.934
Oh, that was some ride.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.936
Celebrate what?
What was some ride?

09:29.002 --> 09:32.140
Oh, uh, this--
this, uh, chick

09:32.173 --> 09:33.607
that he picked up
after work last night.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.143
No, I'm tellin' you, man.

09:35.143 --> 09:36.777
Junior here,
he's hell on the ladies.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.779
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, right.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.452
He didn't believe you.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.287
I wonder why.

09:46.354 --> 09:48.922
You want to go up to Pechanga?
Let's do it.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.625
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.493
I got money to burn.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.762
Oh, yeah.
No, I know you do.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.465
All right. Let's hit
the bricks, all right?

09:57.531 --> 10:01.435
Ah. Another day,
another dollar.

10:01.502 --> 10:02.470
Let's go.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.243
So, who the hell
planted the gun?

10:09.310 --> 10:10.978
Why frame Rykoff?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.146
Somebody in
the organization

10:12.213 --> 10:13.714
wanted to get rid of
Allen and Rykoff.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.049
Or maybe an outsider
wants to make Allen's murder

10:16.116 --> 10:18.719
look like a mob hit.
Rykoff was just a way
to do that.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.654
- What about the wife?
- We haven't ruled her out
at all.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.390
I'm thinkin' there's money
we haven't found yet.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.024
Have you heard anything
from the probate court?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.593
Not yet,
but I've got it wired.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.994
Judge makes a move,
we'll know.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.163
Maybe it's love.

10:29.230 --> 10:30.464
What,
so she's in love,

10:30.531 --> 10:31.599
and she wants Allen
out of the way.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.601
Not her, him.
His girlfriend Layla.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.170
What?
I thought she didn't care
about the girlfriends.

10:36.237 --> 10:37.605
Maybe she cares
about this one.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.208
We have a possible lead to
the girlfriend here in L.A.

10:40.274 --> 10:42.710
Well, don't let me
keep you, gentlemen.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.296
What?

11:02.363 --> 11:04.398
Police.
Open up.

11:12.373 --> 11:15.276
LAPD. We're looking for
Marina Oresh.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.758
You have warrant?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.593
Just a few questions.

11:32.660 --> 11:33.661
I call lawyer.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.529
He gets here,
you can ask questions.

11:35.596 --> 11:37.465
You're familiar with
our legal system.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.602
American cops
can't do shit.

11:41.669 --> 11:44.004
Your criminals don't know
how easy they got it.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.681
You wait outside
'til lawyer gets here.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.916
Hey, you know our system,
you know it can take forever

11:55.983 --> 11:57.651
to resolve
legal problems.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.787
Oh, I have no
legal problems.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.456
- You will.
- Inspections,
code violations.

12:02.523 --> 12:04.124
Running an illegal business
out of your home.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.660
What illegal business?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.296
Those girls.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.964
Friends.
They stay with me.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.132
This ain't Russia.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.302
You can't bribe
your way out of it.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.571
Ask questions.

12:17.638 --> 12:20.341
You vouched for
Lilliet Saroyan

12:20.408 --> 12:22.310
- on her visa application.
- Mm-hmm.

12:22.310 --> 12:23.444
Have any idea
where she might be?

12:23.511 --> 12:25.078
Oh, she left.
Years ago.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.381
Visa up.
Back to Armenia.

12:27.448 --> 12:29.016
What was your
relationship?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.384
Family friend.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.953
Like these
young women?

12:35.923 --> 12:36.890
Like them.

12:39.727 --> 12:41.362
Why you looking
for Layla?

12:41.429 --> 12:42.763
We're investigating
a murder,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.898
a man named Tony Allen.
He was a friend of Layla's.

12:46.634 --> 12:48.001
She never mentioned him.

12:49.570 --> 12:50.871
What about Joey Marks?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.406
You know him?

12:54.408 --> 12:55.943
Enough questions.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.511
Goodbye.

13:07.355 --> 13:09.357
She knows Marks.
Must be his place.

13:09.423 --> 13:12.793
Part of his
prostitution pipeline.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.728
Layla started here.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.865
Those girls are headed for
the same North Vegas shit hole.

13:19.232 --> 13:24.372
Um, get me some
kettle chips and, uh--

13:24.405 --> 13:27.040
Ooh. St. Pauli.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.442
And I'm driving.

13:28.509 --> 13:29.843
- What?
- Mm-hm.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.379
Dude, it's one beer.

13:31.379 --> 13:33.647
No, you had three
at dinner, bro.

13:33.714 --> 13:35.215
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.451
What are you, my wife?
Come on, man.

13:37.518 --> 13:39.052
Uh-huh.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.087
Come on,
you should get one, too.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.389
Yeah, okay.

13:41.422 --> 13:43.056
- Come on, let's party.
- Jesus Christ.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.395
Oh, ooh, get me the, uh--
the 24 ounce.

13:47.428 --> 13:49.997
The tall boy.
Thirsty.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.667
Ahh.

14:10.718 --> 14:12.753
Hey-oh, Kaman.
What up, man?

14:15.423 --> 14:17.525
Oh, let's see.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.434
St. Pauli.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.836
Of course,
no St. Pauli.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.039
All right. Kammy,
no St. Pauli tonight?

14:32.105 --> 14:36.109
Hm, well, you're just
gonna have to settle for
a Corona tonight, amigo.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.239
George?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.975
George!

15:08.041 --> 15:09.109
Talk to me, man.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.879
George, where are you,
buddy, talk to me.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.481
Talk to me,
where are you?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.484
Oh, shit.

15:16.484 --> 15:19.086
Oh, shit!
Shit!

15:19.152 --> 15:20.788
Motherfucker!

15:24.625 --> 15:26.527
Victor 14,
I have an officer down,

15:26.594 --> 15:28.629
I repeat, my partner
has been shot,

15:28.696 --> 15:29.830
there is an officer down.

15:29.897 --> 15:31.198
Send an RA now!

15:31.264 --> 15:32.866
All units, standby,
shots have been fired.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.301
Officer needs help.
Victor one--

15:34.367 --> 15:36.203
No, no, no, no.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.404
Fuckin' dammit!

15:37.505 --> 15:38.706
Fuck!

15:55.222 --> 15:58.291
You know, we should replace
these vanity lights with LEDs.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.528
- Go green.
- Irv.

16:00.561 --> 16:01.729
We're at an age,

16:01.795 --> 16:05.198
we want less light when we
look in the mirror,

16:05.265 --> 16:06.600
not more.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.551
At this hour?

16:35.996 --> 16:36.964
I'll get it.

16:46.406 --> 16:50.578
Wash. I didn't
call for the car.

16:50.644 --> 16:52.746
There's been an
officer involved shooting.

16:52.813 --> 16:56.149
I got a call to pick you up
and bring you to the scene.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.785
Your son's the officer.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.121
Is he hurt?

17:01.188 --> 17:03.591
I don't know, sir,
they didn't say.

17:07.728 --> 17:08.896
I'll be right out.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.180
Irv.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.085
There's an officer
involved shooting.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.655
They, uh-- they want me
at the scene.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.534
Hopefully,
this won't take long.

17:47.635 --> 17:50.370
And I'll be asleep
when you get back.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.772
I'll try not to wake you.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.333
Chief Silva.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.569
Chief.

18:22.670 --> 18:25.572
What happened here?

18:25.673 --> 18:28.041
Where's my son?
Who did he shoot?

18:30.844 --> 18:32.813
Your son was the victim.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.316
The victim?

18:38.385 --> 18:40.688
I'm so sorry.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.331
Where is he?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.902
I want to see him.

19:44.017 --> 19:44.785
Irv.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.775
Detectives Espinosa
and Coniff,

20:07.841 --> 20:09.576
they're--
they're lead on this.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.745
Sir.

20:11.812 --> 20:13.847
Our deepest
condolences, sir.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.568
George.

21:45.973 --> 21:47.307
Oh, my boy.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.960
Tell the coroner's people
that, uh--

22:11.164 --> 22:13.934
when they're done
documenting,

22:14.001 --> 22:16.803
I'd like my son's badge.

22:16.904 --> 22:18.071
Of course.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.081
Security footage.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.251
Irv, I--

22:31.318 --> 22:32.986
I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.192
I want to see it.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.388
**

24:08.481 --> 24:10.550
District Attorney
O'Shea is outside,

24:10.617 --> 24:12.419
wants to know if
he can come in.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.656
No.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.121
All right,
as we all know,

24:48.188 --> 24:51.491
Detectives Espinosa and
Coniff will be leading
this investigation.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.060
Everybody
coordinate with them.

24:53.060 --> 24:55.062
Any questions?
Good.

24:55.128 --> 24:57.664
I'll be turning this briefing
over to Lieutenant Lao

24:57.730 --> 25:01.401
of the special operations
division of IA.

25:01.468 --> 25:07.240
What we discuss here
must remain absolutely
confidential.

25:07.307 --> 25:10.077
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, chief.

25:10.077 --> 25:12.945
Officer Irving was
part of an ongoing
internal investigation

25:13.080 --> 25:16.249
of plain clothes personnel in
the narcotics and vice units

25:16.316 --> 25:17.750
in the Valley
and West bureaus.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.153
This investigation
include his partner?

25:20.220 --> 25:22.555
Yes.
Edward Arceneaux.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.757
Over the last few months,
Officer Irving had gathered

25:24.824 --> 25:27.694
substantial evidence on
Arceneaux's criminal activities,

25:27.760 --> 25:29.862
and he had just met
a group of his accomplices,

25:29.929 --> 25:32.165
and participated in an
armed robbery of a drop house

25:32.232 --> 25:33.433
in Highland Park.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.768
How many cops
we talkin' about?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.504
So far,
a handful.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.971
Investigation's still in
its early stages.

25:39.106 --> 25:40.273
Names?

25:40.340 --> 25:42.275
He'd identified
a female officer,

25:42.342 --> 25:44.111
Maureen O'Grady.

25:44.177 --> 25:47.547
We have descriptions,
nicknames, and audio tapes
on the others.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.116
All males.

25:49.116 --> 25:51.484
When we know
who they are,
you'll know.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.154
With George Irving gone,
I'm not gonna lie,
we're hurting.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.789
We were a long way from
going to the D.A.
before this happened,

25:56.856 --> 25:58.125
I'm not sure where we are.

25:58.191 --> 26:00.560
All right.
So the situation here,

26:00.627 --> 26:02.962
we don't know if
it's armed robbery,
some gang banger,

26:03.029 --> 26:05.565
Officer Irving in
the wrong place
at the wrong time,

26:05.632 --> 26:09.136
or an assassination by
one of these dirty cops.

26:09.169 --> 26:10.337
What are the chances
they found out

26:10.403 --> 26:11.904
Officer Irving was
working for IA?

26:11.971 --> 26:15.142
Officer Irving
did not believe that
he was under suspicion.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.477
How involved does IA
expect to be?

26:17.544 --> 26:19.512
It's RHD's investigation,

26:19.579 --> 26:20.780
but George Irving
was our guy.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.215
We will assist you
in any way we can.

26:22.282 --> 26:23.750
All right,
so what do we do?

26:23.816 --> 26:25.452
What's our first move,
do we bring 'em in?

26:25.518 --> 26:27.320
I say we
wait and watch.

26:27.387 --> 26:29.656
If they didn't know that
Officer Irving was undercover,

26:29.722 --> 26:32.024
I absolutely want to
keep it that way.

26:32.159 --> 26:34.861
Okay then.
RHD will put O'Grady

26:34.927 --> 26:36.596
and Arceneaux
under surveillance.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.766
I want to talk to him.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.268
To Arceneaux.

26:43.170 --> 26:45.605
Officer Irving...

26:45.672 --> 26:47.340
was my son.

26:51.544 --> 26:53.380
Uh, Chief.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.217
Maybe you and I
should step outside.

27:12.399 --> 27:14.201
I think he knows
who killed George.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.203
You know the rules,

27:16.236 --> 27:17.870
you can't be involved.

27:17.937 --> 27:21.073
Espinosa and Coniff are
running this investigation.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.242
Let them do their job.

27:22.309 --> 27:23.876
Don't try to
marginalize me, Frank.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.112
I've been on
the other side of this
and I know how it works.

27:26.213 --> 27:29.081
You'll shut me out.

27:29.216 --> 27:31.384
Go home.
Be with your wife.

27:31.451 --> 27:34.020
You don't want her
to get the news
from some reporter.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.324
You need to be there,
not here.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.426
I'll keep you informed,
I promise.

27:59.712 --> 28:00.747
Can't sleep either?

28:04.351 --> 28:07.254
Deputy Chief Irving's
son was killed tonight.

28:07.287 --> 28:09.088
Walked into the middle
of a robbery.

28:09.155 --> 28:12.024
Convenience store
in the Valley.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.260
That's awful.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.532
You knew him?

28:21.934 --> 28:24.871
Just to say hi to.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.673
He worked patrol,
Hollywood.

28:26.739 --> 28:30.977
Last winter he transferred
downtown to a desk.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.279
Command track.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.316
He was off the streets.

28:40.287 --> 28:41.821
Then this.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.293
All units,

28:46.326 --> 28:47.694
this is an
end of watch broadcast

28:47.760 --> 28:50.830
for police officer two,
George Irving.

28:50.897 --> 28:54.100
Serial number 37346.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.703
On July 24, 2015,

28:56.769 --> 29:00.473
Officer Irving was killed
in the line of duty.

29:02.642 --> 29:05.845
Officer Irving
graduated from the
Los Angeles Police Academy

29:05.912 --> 29:08.681
on November 3, 2012.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.618
His first assignment
was Newton Division.

29:11.684 --> 29:13.052
After finishing probation,

29:13.119 --> 29:15.021
he transferred to
Hollywood Division,

29:15.087 --> 29:18.325
then to Valley Narcotics.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.228
Officer Irving served with
courage and distinction,

29:22.329 --> 29:26.198
risking his own life
to safeguard the citizens
of Los Angeles.

29:26.333 --> 29:30.337
He is survived by his father,
Deputy Chief Irvin Irving,

29:30.337 --> 29:33.440
and his mother
Constance Irving.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.750
Officer George Irving,
the city of Los Angeles,

29:43.816 --> 29:45.485
and the Los Angeles
Police Department

29:45.552 --> 29:48.087
are forever grateful
for your service.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.723
They will never forget
your ultimate sacrifice.

29:58.465 --> 30:00.367
Officer Irving,

30:00.433 --> 30:05.204
end of watch
July 24, 2015.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.305
Good night.

30:16.349 --> 30:19.118
A police officer
was killed last night.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.219
Yeah, we heard.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.088
Did you know him?

30:22.154 --> 30:24.524
Not really.
A little.

30:24.591 --> 30:25.858
You got your stuff ready
to go to Lisa's?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.860
I'm gonna drop you off
on my way to work.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.061
It's Saturday.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.431
I'm workin' a case.
Gotta go in.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.566
I'll get my stuff.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.937
Grace'll watch 'em
like a hawk.

30:38.004 --> 30:40.172
Yeah, I'm okay with it.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.474
Makes me feel like
the danger's over,

30:41.541 --> 30:42.575
and we should
just go home.

30:42.642 --> 30:44.110
I'm not really
sure about that,

30:44.176 --> 30:45.512
so just humor me, okay?

30:45.578 --> 30:47.880
Stick around
a couple more days.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.716
I think you just like
having us here.

30:49.782 --> 30:52.519
Yeah, I do.

30:52.585 --> 30:53.786
Give me a hug?

30:56.823 --> 30:58.725
- Have fun.
- Bye.

31:25.452 --> 31:26.953
Thanks.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.903
I'm being tailed.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.639
Course you are.

31:46.706 --> 31:49.476
What the fuck happened
last night?

31:49.509 --> 31:52.078
Your buddy
was a snitch.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.480
George?
There's no way.

31:53.513 --> 31:54.881
How the fuck would you
know that, anyway?

31:54.947 --> 31:59.719
He worked for IA,
and he wore a wire,

31:59.786 --> 32:01.588
and you brought him
into our group,

32:01.654 --> 32:03.189
you dumb cocksucker.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.191
Fuck.

32:08.795 --> 32:12.298
Okay. So what
are we gonna do?

32:12.364 --> 32:13.966
You repped up, right?

32:14.033 --> 32:15.067
Yeah. Of course.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.737
I have to make a formal
statement on Monday.

32:19.872 --> 32:22.742
Tell your rep
you want to go IOD.

32:22.809 --> 32:24.711
But I wasn't
injured on duty.

32:24.777 --> 32:28.114
Emotional stress.
Death of a partner.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.383
That'll delay
the hearing.

32:31.518 --> 32:32.619
Okay.

32:34.921 --> 32:36.222
They'll tell you
you'll walk

32:36.288 --> 32:38.925
if you
give up your crew.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.728
Don't buy what
they're selling.

32:41.794 --> 32:45.732
Yeah. I know
how it works. Thanks.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.568
Yeah, well,
just in case
you're tempted,

32:48.635 --> 32:50.570
last night's gun's
got your prints on it.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.038
The fuck it d--

32:52.104 --> 32:54.941
- The fuck it does.
- Keep your voice down.

32:57.944 --> 33:00.379
When you took down
the drop house,

33:00.446 --> 33:01.981
same gun.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.019
Oh, you motherfucker.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.655
That's right.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.422
So you start
cuttin' deals,

33:10.557 --> 33:13.325
that weapon's
gonna turn up.

33:13.392 --> 33:14.661
Cops are gonna know...

33:14.727 --> 33:17.764
that you set up
your partner.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.590
Ms. Wish.

33:43.623 --> 33:46.593
Special Agent
Jay Griffin.

33:46.659 --> 33:48.628
Need to see some ID?

33:48.695 --> 33:50.229
No, that won't be
necessary.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.031
You've got bureau
written all over you.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.635
What do you want?

33:55.702 --> 33:57.637
Your ex husband
is involved in a case

33:57.704 --> 34:00.472
that's become entangled
in one of our operations.

34:00.607 --> 34:03.075
What kind of operation?

34:03.142 --> 34:05.011
Counter terrorism.

34:05.077 --> 34:07.614
We need him to share
his findings with us.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.682
Have you asked him
to do that?

34:09.749 --> 34:11.984
Assurances that people
give aren't always honored.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.521
So, what, you want me
to spy on him?

34:15.622 --> 34:17.023
We're only asking
for information

34:17.089 --> 34:19.325
he should be
giving us anyway.

34:21.628 --> 34:22.762
No.

34:25.932 --> 34:28.635
You resigned from the bureau
10 years ago under a cloud.

34:28.701 --> 34:30.169
It was a poker debt.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.438
I wasn't a participant
in the fraud,

34:32.504 --> 34:34.707
it was completely
unconnected.

34:34.774 --> 34:38.077
I admitted my mistake
and I resigned.

34:38.144 --> 34:43.883
Well, if you ask me,
it was a bullshit charge.

34:43.950 --> 34:45.652
And the waste of
a good agent.

34:45.685 --> 34:47.286
That's water
under the bridge.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.821
What does this
have to do with Harry?

34:48.888 --> 34:51.023
How'd you like to
get back in?

34:52.892 --> 34:55.962
Back in? You mean
like the bureau?

34:56.028 --> 34:57.830
I assume you started
playing poker for a living

34:57.897 --> 34:59.799
'cause nobody else
would hire you.

34:59.866 --> 35:02.368
And your bureau record's
been red flagged.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.903
I can change that.

35:03.970 --> 35:05.571
You help us,
we'll help you.

35:05.672 --> 35:09.508
You're gonna expunge my record
if I spy on my ex husband?

35:09.575 --> 35:11.678
The bureau
can't take you back.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.379
But there are
a lot of agencies out there

35:13.445 --> 35:15.848
that are looking for
profilers these days,
Ms. Wish.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.291
Here.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.220
Police state that
shell casings and evidence

35:54.286 --> 35:57.724
only begins to indicate
the chaos that was
last night in Van Nuys.

35:57.724 --> 35:59.258
Tough break.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.760
- Anything new?
- Yeah.

36:00.827 --> 36:04.363
I heard they collected
three different kinds
of casings

36:04.430 --> 36:06.165
from one gun.

36:06.232 --> 36:08.735
Nothin' says gang banger
like mixed brass.

36:08.735 --> 36:10.737
Fuckin' irony, right?
I mean, the--

36:10.803 --> 36:12.271
the kid transfers
to a desk,

36:12.338 --> 36:15.775
and gets popped by
some gang banger
in a random robbery.

36:15.842 --> 36:17.543
It's like those vets
coming home from Iraq.

36:17.609 --> 36:18.978
They survive
that shit storm,

36:19.045 --> 36:20.913
then they get
killed at the movies
by some lunatic

36:20.980 --> 36:24.250
who thinks that
sprayin' the audience
with an automatic rifle

36:24.316 --> 36:27.419
is a fuckin' video game.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.522
I hear an IA captain
was at the scene last night.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.358
Yeah, what's up
with that?

36:32.424 --> 36:33.392
They lookin' at George?

36:33.459 --> 36:35.361
Your guess is
as good as mine.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.097
Later.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.773
Hey,
Detective Bosch.

36:46.806 --> 36:47.907
Pierce.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.976
I keep thinking
it's my fault.

36:50.042 --> 36:50.910
How so?

36:50.977 --> 36:53.780
Last year when we
pulled Waits over,

36:53.846 --> 36:55.381
George keyed in
the wrong plate

36:55.447 --> 36:56.783
so we could make
the stop.

36:56.816 --> 36:59.051
I remember.

36:59.118 --> 37:01.020
I should have
let it go.

37:01.087 --> 37:03.022
I mean,
we'd still be partners.

37:03.089 --> 37:05.792
George would still be here
in patrol.

37:05.825 --> 37:06.859
He'd be alive.

37:06.926 --> 37:08.360
Get that
out of your head.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.262
He was ambitious,
wanted out of patrol.

37:10.329 --> 37:13.099
It was just
a matter of time,
not your fault.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.402
Be safe.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.213
Sad day.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.115
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.

37:29.181 --> 37:30.216
Yeah.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.118
These are the books
I told you about.

37:32.184 --> 37:34.620
Yeah,
I got this one at home.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.022
Same edition.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.725
It's a new testament
in Armenian.

37:39.826 --> 37:43.695
Uh, Book of Prayers
of St. Gregory.

37:43.830 --> 37:45.865
Hm.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.266
Your girl's religious.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.970
Let me show you
something else.

37:51.037 --> 37:53.005
You recognize
this church?

37:53.072 --> 37:57.376
Yeah. That's, uh,
Tsiranavor in Yerevan.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.079
It's one of the
oldest churches in Armenia.

38:00.146 --> 38:02.181
What about this?
What's this say?

38:02.248 --> 38:03.582
Well, that tells you
who the book belongs to.

38:03.649 --> 38:04.884
Let's see.

38:04.951 --> 38:07.519
Our Lady
Queen of Martyrs

38:07.586 --> 38:09.922
Armenian Catholic Church.

38:09.989 --> 38:11.858
That in Yerevan, too?

38:11.858 --> 38:13.025
Boyle Heights.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.652
Yes. These are ours.

38:40.719 --> 38:41.888
How did you
come by them?

38:41.921 --> 38:43.722
They were in possession
of a young woman

38:43.789 --> 38:46.292
we're looking for.
Lilliet Saroyan.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.394
We found them
in her apartment.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.261
Hm.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.198
She also goes by
the name Layla.

38:52.932 --> 38:54.766
Is she in trouble?

38:54.901 --> 38:57.036
Not with us.
But she might be in danger

38:57.103 --> 38:59.939
with a group of
Armenian gangsters
in Las Vegas.

39:00.006 --> 39:02.274
That's very
distressing news.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.710
You know her.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.778
Any idea where
she might be?

39:06.913 --> 39:09.781
She said she was
moving to Las Vegas.

39:09.916 --> 39:10.983
I gave her the books.

39:11.050 --> 39:13.419
I thought they might
be of some solace,

39:13.485 --> 39:14.921
remind her of home.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.925
That was, I don't know,
two years ago.

39:18.958 --> 39:22.094
Haven't heard
from her since?

39:22.161 --> 39:25.464
She called me
a few months ago,
in fact.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.533
Said that she was
engaged to be married.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.435
She say to who?

39:29.501 --> 39:31.237
She did not.

39:31.303 --> 39:35.474
She wanted to know if
she could get married
in this church,

39:35.541 --> 39:37.409
and if I
would officiate.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.646
I said yes,
of course.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.382
But then she
never called again.

39:43.449 --> 39:46.452
You know if she had
any friends here in L.A.,
family?

39:48.120 --> 39:49.956
Not that I know of, no.

39:49.989 --> 39:52.091
If you think of
anything else,

39:52.158 --> 39:53.960
or if she gets in touch,

39:54.026 --> 39:57.496
would you please
give us a call.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.365
Of course.

40:02.001 --> 40:03.435
How about that?

40:03.502 --> 40:04.937
You think Mrs. Allen
knew her husband was

40:05.004 --> 40:06.005
planning on marrying
his lollipop?

40:06.072 --> 40:07.373
And take all his money
with him?

40:07.439 --> 40:09.008
She didn't care about
the other women

40:09.075 --> 40:10.542
'cause he wasn't
serious about them.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.743
Marriage is serious?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.145
As a heart attack,
brother.

40:13.212 --> 40:15.681
That's just what it is.
A heart attack.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.390
Come in.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.193
They're gone.

40:28.995 --> 40:32.398
You think
they'll be back?

40:32.464 --> 40:35.667
You sure you don't
want to talk to them, huh?

40:35.734 --> 40:38.304
I just want to go away.

40:38.370 --> 40:39.972
I spoke with the man
this morning.

40:40.039 --> 40:43.542
Should be here soon.
A few more days.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.011
What's taking so long?

40:45.077 --> 40:47.413
It's a popular passport.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.581
Takes time.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.616
Okay.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.421
I want to thank you for
your kindness, Father.

40:55.487 --> 40:56.788
I don't know what
I would have done

40:56.855 --> 40:58.257
if you hadn't
taken me in.

40:58.324 --> 41:02.094
I should be thanking you,
Lilliet, for your generosity.

41:02.161 --> 41:04.463
A token.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.765
I could never repay you
or the church.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.268
When you get to
where you're going,
let me know.

41:09.335 --> 41:12.571
I'll put you in contact
with someone.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.040
You don't know
where I'm going.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.907
I don't have to.

41:16.042 --> 41:18.410
We're like the Chinese.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.113
We're everywhere.

41:21.180 --> 41:22.581
I'll drop you a card.

41:35.794 --> 41:39.098
You lied.
To me.

41:42.201 --> 41:43.769
The whole time.

41:46.505 --> 41:50.076
George didn't want you
to know, either.

41:50.076 --> 41:51.577
He didn't want you to worry.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.118
Don't blame our son.

42:00.352 --> 42:03.889
It was his decision,
it was what he wanted.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.158
None of this
would have happened

42:06.225 --> 42:08.294
without your blessing.

42:12.664 --> 42:15.101
It was a fast path
to command track,

42:15.167 --> 42:17.103
which is what you wanted
for him, too.

42:20.706 --> 42:23.109
I wanted him safe.

42:26.345 --> 42:28.247
This was a way to
make that happen.

42:35.821 --> 42:37.423
You killed our son.

42:40.226 --> 42:42.728
That's not fair, Connie.

42:42.794 --> 42:47.599
You... killed him.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.204
Oh, I can't stand
to look at you.

43:30.476 --> 43:32.811
- Ice?
- No ice.

43:35.581 --> 43:36.648
Grace call?

43:36.715 --> 43:37.583
Yeah.

43:37.649 --> 43:38.884
Maddie and Lisa
are getting along

43:38.950 --> 43:40.552
like two peas in a pod.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.421
Nice.

43:42.488 --> 43:45.090
I'll pick her up
in the morning.

43:45.191 --> 43:46.392
How was your day?

43:46.458 --> 43:48.194
Not bad.

43:48.227 --> 43:50.429
Made some headway.

43:50.496 --> 43:52.798
Girlfriend
of our victim.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.200
Is she the killer?

43:54.233 --> 43:56.635
Might be the motive.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.205
How was your day?

43:59.205 --> 44:01.573
A little stir crazy
sitting around here all day?

44:01.640 --> 44:05.211
Matter of fact,
I was, so I, uh,
borrowed the car.

44:05.244 --> 44:06.678
Don't look at me
like that.

44:06.745 --> 44:09.815
The closest I got
to being snatched
was by the FBI.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.355
I was just
enjoying myself
at Echo Park,

44:16.422 --> 44:18.056
looking at the lake,

44:18.123 --> 44:19.325
who should sidle up
next to me

44:19.391 --> 44:21.993
but special agent
Jay Griffin.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.663
That asshole?
Are you shittin' me?

44:24.730 --> 44:26.865
What did he want?

44:26.932 --> 44:28.567
He wants me to
spy on you.

44:28.634 --> 44:29.735
What?

44:29.801 --> 44:32.338
Feed him whatever I can
about your investigation.

44:34.406 --> 44:38.310
And he said he would take
the flag off my record

44:38.377 --> 44:40.879
so that I could
start again somewhere else

44:40.946 --> 44:42.147
in law enforcement.

44:42.248 --> 44:45.684
Unbelievable.
What did you tell him?

44:45.751 --> 44:47.018
Told him to fuck off.

44:47.085 --> 44:48.420
I appreciate that.

44:48.487 --> 44:50.422
Yeah, well,
whatever I think
about my ex husband,

44:50.489 --> 44:53.692
I'm not gonna spy on
the father of my child.

44:55.261 --> 44:56.962
Call him Monday morning.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.129
Tell him what?

44:58.264 --> 44:59.531
Tell him you
changed your mind,

44:59.598 --> 45:02.868
but you want it in writing
about your record.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.403
Tell him I'm working on
something good,

45:04.470 --> 45:06.104
something he'll want.

45:06.171 --> 45:08.274
And you'll
give it to him,

45:08.274 --> 45:09.841
but only if he
puts the deal in writing.

45:29.495 --> 45:32.197
Good evening, ma'am.

45:32.298 --> 45:33.832
Sorry to bother you
this late.

45:33.899 --> 45:35.701
Coyote's been spotted
in the highlands,

45:35.767 --> 45:37.636
and we're asking
all the residents

45:37.703 --> 45:40.706
to keep
their pets indoors.

45:40.772 --> 45:45.577
Have you seen
any coyote scat
in your backyard?

45:45.644 --> 45:47.045
Coyote scat.

45:47.112 --> 45:49.581
Um, I don't think
I would know

45:49.648 --> 45:52.484
what coyote scat looks like
if I saw it.

45:52.551 --> 45:54.853
Maybe you should go back
and check for yourself.

46:07.433 --> 46:11.337
Well, this is a
nice surprise, officer.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.972
What does
your lawyer say?

46:14.039 --> 46:15.607
When are we getting in?

46:15.674 --> 46:17.008
Soon.

46:17.075 --> 46:19.044
I told you
it'll take some time.

46:21.079 --> 46:22.648
What is wrong?

46:24.983 --> 46:26.352
Nothing.

46:26.352 --> 46:29.020
Just tired of waiting,
that's all.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.156
We're almost there,
sweetheart.

46:31.222 --> 46:33.359
We're almost there.

46:36.862 --> 46:38.930
Okay.

46:41.266 --> 46:44.102
Are you sure you
don't want to stay?

46:44.169 --> 46:45.771
Can't.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.273
There really is a
fucking coyote out there.

46:48.374 --> 46:50.041
Oh. Well--

46:52.944 --> 46:55.046
A coyote can wait.

47:31.550 --> 47:34.686
