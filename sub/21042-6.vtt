WEBVTT

00:08.209 --> 00:09.843
NARRATOR: So, here we are.

00:09.877 --> 00:13.547
Humanity has merged with
artificial intelligence.

00:13.581 --> 00:17.218
We've created
a solar system-wide Dyson sphere

00:17.251 --> 00:21.155
that will power our
technologically-heavy lives.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.891
And now Oscar and Eva
are getting ready

00:23.924 --> 00:26.394
to see their friend
who left Earth behind

00:26.427 --> 00:30.431
to colonize planets
in far-flung galaxies.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.499
OSCAR: When will she be here?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.701
EVA: Any minute.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.505
OSCAR: How long has it been
since we've seen her?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.039
EVA: Years.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.909
OSCAR: That's crazy.

00:41.942 --> 00:44.745
NARRATOR: In the deep future,
revolutionizing space travel

00:44.778 --> 00:49.283
also means we'll have to
rethink the human form.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.088
EVA: Sajani.

00:54.122 --> 00:58.126
SAJANI: Eva, you haven't
aged a day.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.793
EVA: Oh.

00:59.827 --> 01:03.431
Wow, you look...

01:03.464 --> 01:06.033
SAJANI: A little different?
Yeah.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.035
NARRATOR: Yes, those are gills.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.205
They'll come in handy if
we need to breathe underwater

01:11.239 --> 01:13.941
on some kind of
ocean-covered planet.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.410
They also might be
the beginning of the end

01:16.444 --> 01:19.147
of the human race as we know it.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.724
It's the deep future.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.893
Your body, gone.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.830
You're all computer,
all the time.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.966
Your brain is way more powerful

01:38.999 --> 01:42.736
than even a billion
supercomputers.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.941
Jobs, food, language, water,
even traditional thought,

01:47.975 --> 01:50.511
all of humanity's
building blocks,

01:50.544 --> 01:52.346
all that's done.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.183
And you are immortal.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.017
Squirming in your chair yet?

01:57.050 --> 01:58.486
You should be.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.288
This isn't science fiction.

02:00.321 --> 02:03.991
Today's visionary thinkers say
it's a strong probability

02:04.024 --> 02:07.328
that this is what your world
is going to look like.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.798
Tonight, they'll guide you
toward that spectacular future,

02:10.831 --> 02:13.467
and we'll see how
one family navigates it,

02:13.501 --> 02:15.636
one invention at a time.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.772
This is the story
of your future.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.142
This is the road
to Year Million.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.453
I've shown you a version
of the future

02:32.486 --> 02:34.788
when in the Year Million era

02:34.822 --> 02:36.324
humanity as we know it

02:36.357 --> 02:39.193
will have undergone such
a radical transformation,

02:39.227 --> 02:43.397
we can hardly imagine what
it will mean to be human.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.533
MICHIO KAKU: By the time
we're at the Year Million,

02:45.566 --> 02:49.136
we will be
a galactic civilization.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.474
We'll be able to roam
the galactic space lanes,

02:53.507 --> 02:57.878
to play with black holes,
and leap through a wormhole.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.648
And you may say, well, why?

03:00.681 --> 03:01.682
NARRATOR: Why?

03:01.715 --> 03:05.653
Well, because A) it's cool,

03:05.686 --> 03:09.189
and B) because we need to find
a few spare planets

03:09.223 --> 03:10.924
where we can chill for a second

03:10.958 --> 03:16.029
in order to survive any sort of
extinction event here on Earth.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.399
RANGA-RAM CHARY: All species
that have undergone a major boom

03:18.432 --> 03:21.001
have also undergone
a major bust.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.102
GEORGE DVORSKY:
An asteroid hits the planet

03:22.135 --> 03:24.438
once every 200,000 years.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.906
So if we're talking about

03:25.939 --> 03:28.175
half a million to a million year
timescales,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.677
we should at least
anticipate one,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.245
if not several of those events,

03:31.279 --> 03:34.482
on the scale that drove
the dinosaurs to extinction.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.888
CHUCK NICE:
The Earth will continue.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.625
We just won't.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.427
NARRATOR: I understand.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.097
The end of the human race on
Earth is tough to think about.

03:50.130 --> 03:54.268
But the good news is that we are
a pretty resilient species,

03:54.302 --> 03:57.571
and more importantly, we've got
a nearly unquenchable lust

03:57.605 --> 04:01.775
for exploration baked deep
into our collective bones.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.445
KAKU: I think we have
a curiosity gene,

04:04.478 --> 04:06.079
a gene within us that says,

04:06.113 --> 04:08.816
what's on the other side
of that hill?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.218
So there will always be
restless people

04:11.251 --> 04:14.087
who will want to go to Mars
just for the hell of it.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.790
NARRATOR: So when we find
ourselves looking

04:16.824 --> 04:18.726
for another rock to park on,

04:18.759 --> 04:20.294
that wanderlust,

04:20.328 --> 04:23.063
that craving for thrills,
chills, and adventure,

04:23.096 --> 04:27.568
will ultimately be
the saving grace of our species.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.739
Right now, all of our eggs
are here in the Earth basket.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
If we plan on surviving,

04:33.641 --> 04:37.645
we need to scatter those eggs
around the galaxy.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.912
ANDERS SANDBERG:
If an intelligent species

04:38.946 --> 04:41.114
starts spreading
between the stars,

04:41.148 --> 04:44.284
it's pretty unlikely
to go extinct.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.986
NARRATOR: So if we are going
to launch ourselves

04:46.019 --> 04:48.021
into galaxies far, far away,

04:48.055 --> 04:50.190
we've got a little work
to do first.

04:50.223 --> 04:55.663
Here's how we human beings will
achieve intergalactic travel.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.498
First we'll need to understand
the effects

04:57.531 --> 05:00.200
of extreme space travel
on our bodies.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.169
Because it'll be
even harder on us

05:02.202 --> 05:05.973
than that little chip shot
of a trip to Mars.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.542
That's when our future tech
will serve us well,

05:08.576 --> 05:12.613
since we will send out
artificially intelligent robots.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.615
They will be our advance team,

05:14.648 --> 05:17.117
helping us travel
deeper into space.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.353
They'll terraform planets
for us,

05:19.387 --> 05:24.157
and have them all set up before
we even leave our atmosphere.

05:24.191 --> 05:27.327
And when we do decide
to depart from Earth,

05:27.361 --> 05:31.532
we'll need to rethink whatever
space bus we'll be driving.

05:31.565 --> 05:35.068
And humanity,
through gene manipulation,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.971
changes into another species.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.541
One that could withstand
the toxic environment

05:40.574 --> 05:45.145
of whatever exoplanet
we've decided to make our home.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.749
And while we're out rocketing
between far-flung stars,

05:48.782 --> 05:51.585
we'll probably come
face to face with ideas

05:51.619 --> 05:54.254
that are now only theoretical.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.725
We may discover
parallel universes,

05:57.758 --> 06:02.763
where every choice, every
possibility, exists in tandem.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.899
And hopefully, we will finally
be able to understand

06:05.933 --> 06:09.703
the greatest mystery of all--
dark matter.

06:09.737 --> 06:14.007
The elusive, invisible material
that the universe is made of...

06:14.041 --> 06:15.909
theoretically.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.946
I know, that's millions
of light-years of information.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.348
So let's look at how
we are going to get ourselves

06:21.381 --> 06:24.685
not just to Mars and other
planets in our solar system,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.755
but farther out,
to other galaxies.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.693
PETER DIAMANDIS:
Thousands of years from now,

06:32.726 --> 06:36.630
whatever we've evolved into,
whatever we've become,

06:36.664 --> 06:39.567
we're going to look back in time
at these next few decades

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
as the moment in time
when the human race

06:41.602 --> 06:44.337
irreversibly has moved
off the planet.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
CHARLES SOULE: I'd like to think
I'd go up in a rocket

06:49.577 --> 06:51.579
and fly into space.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.213
But as far as
high-risk occupations,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.816
astronaut is pretty,
pretty up there.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.751
MAN: The men rose early,
ate breakfast,

06:57.785 --> 06:59.887
and dressed
in their space suits.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.254
NARRATOR: Being an astronaut's
pretty much

07:01.288 --> 07:04.758
every kid's dream job.

07:04.792 --> 07:09.897
But most kids only think
of going to the moon or Mars.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.599
We're talking about traveling

07:11.632 --> 07:16.570
for hundreds of thousands,
or even millions of years.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.839
DVORSKY: The human body was
definitely not meant to work

07:18.872 --> 07:23.644
and function in space, and
it does a very poor job of it.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.946
SYD MEAD:
These guys up in orbit,

07:25.979 --> 07:28.582
they come down after up there
about eight months to a year,

07:28.616 --> 07:31.985
they can't walk,
they're helpless.

07:32.019 --> 07:36.524
They're like little,
little babies.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.259
NARRATOR: When we start talking
about intergalactic travel,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.962
that's when we need to
figure out how to stay strong

07:41.995 --> 07:44.832
for a lot more than just a year.

07:44.865 --> 07:55.709
*

08:02.816 --> 08:04.518
NARRATOR: Here at the NASA

08:04.552 --> 08:08.889
Extreme Environment Mission
Operations, or NEEMO for short,

08:08.922 --> 08:12.459
scientists are figuring out
how to keep astronauts in space

08:12.492 --> 08:15.829
for extended periods of time.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.364
You heard me right--

08:17.397 --> 08:22.502
NASA's got a space station
60 feet below sea level.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.805
It's one of the closest things
we have on Earth

08:24.838 --> 08:28.308
to the no-gravity, or more
accurately, microgravity

08:28.341 --> 08:31.344
environment of space.

08:31.378 --> 08:37.084
And like space,
it is stressful and isolated.

08:37.117 --> 08:42.389
A perfect real-life simulation
for deep space astronauts.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.091
DAWN KERNAGIS: It's like
a very long scuba dive.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.860
So essentially
we are diving for days.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.097
We were actually weighted out to
simulate partial microgravity.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.999
The setup was that
we were rigged

08:52.032 --> 08:55.769
to be like we were walking
on the surface of Mars.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.772
NARRATOR: Astronauts live
in small, pressurized pods,

08:58.806 --> 09:01.742
just like the space station,

09:01.775 --> 09:06.880
with daily excursions
that mimic space walks.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.717
Here, scientists hope
to unlock the secrets

09:09.750 --> 09:11.451
of staying healthy in space,

09:11.484 --> 09:13.787
no matter how long
we need to be out there.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.598
NARRATOR: And they've already
got some answers.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.434
KERNAGIS: I study how
to help humans work

09:27.467 --> 09:31.304
to the best of their abilities
in extreme environments.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.874
We were looking
at molecular-level changes

09:33.907 --> 09:37.410
in response to living
with a crew of people

09:37.444 --> 09:38.979
in a small environment,

09:39.012 --> 09:42.582
and there's changes
at the epigenetic level.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.487
NARRATOR: It turns out that
the hardships of space travel

09:47.520 --> 09:50.958
aren't just limited to
the effects of microgravity.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.327
It can affect the very
building blocks of who we are.

09:54.361 --> 09:59.767
Space travel can change our
genes, maybe even permanently,

09:59.800 --> 10:03.070
in what are called
epigenetic changes.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.905
KERNAGIS: Things like
psychological remoteness,

10:04.938 --> 10:07.808
stress, or diet, or exercise,

10:07.841 --> 10:10.110
can change how our genes
are read.

10:10.143 --> 10:15.015
And we actually can pass those
on to our offspring.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
What we want to
attain eventually

10:16.884 --> 10:19.653
is when you see Spock
going with the device

10:19.687 --> 10:22.122
where it scans you
and diagnoses you.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.691
SPOCK: Severe heart damage.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.126
KERNAGIS: That's what
we're aiming for.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.961
NARRATOR: So, no problem.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.364
Once genetic engineering becomes
an everyday doctor's tool,

10:31.398 --> 10:33.667
we can just fix any broken genes

10:33.701 --> 10:37.604
before the problem expresses
itself in the body.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.873
And that'll be important
not only for us,

10:39.907 --> 10:41.541
but for future generations

10:41.574 --> 10:45.946
that may have to be born
out in space.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.381
NICE: To go to Proxima Centauri,

10:48.415 --> 10:49.883
which is, you know,
our closest neighbor,

10:49.917 --> 10:52.686
you would have to send
generations into space.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.022
It would have to be, wow, these
people are going to be born,

10:55.055 --> 10:56.790
the next people are
going to be born,

10:56.824 --> 10:59.392
the next people are going to be
born, those people will die.

10:59.426 --> 11:03.196
And now, I'm out.
Thank you, goodnight.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.665
NARRATOR: If we could travel
at the speed of light,

11:05.699 --> 11:09.737
that would cut down on
our travel time immensely.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.539
But no one is sure that
we can ever get around

11:12.572 --> 11:16.409
the laws of physics
to make that possible.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.845
Luckily, in the future,

11:17.878 --> 11:19.980
we'll have designed
artificial intelligence

11:20.013 --> 11:22.682
who can do our dirty work
for us.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.018
While we humans wait in comfort
here on Earth,

11:25.052 --> 11:27.921
our robot explorers
will voyage into space

11:27.955 --> 11:30.991
to find a nice parking spot
for us,

11:31.024 --> 11:34.527
and even set up colonies
for us to live on.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.003
NARRATOR: At some point,
traveling to planets like Mars

11:43.036 --> 11:46.239
in our solar system will be
like a trip to the park.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.575
Totally last week's news.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.010
Going to deep space will be

11:50.043 --> 11:52.345
what all the cool kids
are talking about.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.115
But we can't do it alone.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.184
MICHAEL GRAZIANO: Space travel
is really hard for humans.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.586
We don't live long enough
to go anywhere interesting.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.722
But artificial intelligence is
just fundamentally different.

12:02.756 --> 12:08.695
It can live indefinitely, it can
be engineered to live in space.

12:08.728 --> 12:13.466
It can swim through space,
like fish in water.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.068
NARRATOR:
Artificial intelligence

12:15.102 --> 12:18.271
is our secret weapon for
traveling to other galaxies.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.040
DVORSKY: We will have
generation ships,

12:20.073 --> 12:21.608
where you create
these massive ships,

12:21.641 --> 12:23.811
fill them with individuals
and robots or whatnot,

12:23.844 --> 12:26.679
and send it off into
the depths of space.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.956
NARRATOR: Take a look at
our future AI daughter, Jess,

12:35.989 --> 12:39.592
who clearly took her father's
advice to go change the world.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.663
Jess has volunteered to lead
a ship of AI and human explorers

12:43.696 --> 12:45.966
who will voyage out
far into the universe

12:45.999 --> 12:48.735
to find humanity a new home.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.071
JESS: Welcome to the ark.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.672
Now, no matter what
your backgrounds,

12:52.705 --> 12:55.976
no matter what your beliefs,
you are welcome here.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.410
These are tight quarters,

12:57.444 --> 12:58.846
and they are probably
not as comfortable

12:58.879 --> 13:00.480
as what some of you are used to,

13:00.513 --> 13:02.415
but we hope that you can make
yourselves feel at home

13:02.449 --> 13:04.351
here in this safe haven.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.754
Now, if you'll all follow me.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.089
NARRATOR: The human passengers
will have

13:09.122 --> 13:10.958
the adventure of a lifetime.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.994
But the AI on board could last
for millions of years,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.429
and they won't need
food or doctors.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.831
They could even
simply power down

13:17.865 --> 13:20.100
until they got to
their destination.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.601
And once they got there,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.871
they could set up
some living pods for us,

13:23.904 --> 13:26.606
or just report back
on what they found.

13:26.639 --> 13:31.111
If only everything
were this easy.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.447
But it's not just about
sending up robots in spaceships.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.483
AI will help us
travel through space

13:36.516 --> 13:38.785
in far more innovative ways.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.187
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
That's where space travel

13:40.220 --> 13:42.022
gets really interesting.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.556
DIAMANDIS: We're going to be
sending avatars,

13:43.590 --> 13:45.692
and we're going to transmit
our consciousness

13:45.725 --> 13:48.695
and not necessarily
our meat bodies to go there.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.364
NARRATOR: Meat bodies? Really?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.200
That's just creepy.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.002
KAKU: What will space travel
look like

13:55.035 --> 13:56.836
hundreds of years from now?

13:56.870 --> 14:00.573
One possibility is something
that I call laserporting.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.876
We're going to be able
to beam our consciousness

14:02.910 --> 14:06.246
into outer space
at the speed of light.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.748
You don't have to worry about
accidents with a booster rocket,

14:08.781 --> 14:11.818
radiation, weightlessness,
none of that,

14:11.851 --> 14:14.021
'cause you're literally
riding on a light beam,

14:14.054 --> 14:18.325
pure consciousness,
going through the heavens.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.227
We put our consciousness
on a laser beam,

14:20.260 --> 14:22.395
shoot that information
to the moon.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.597
On the moon, there's a receiver.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.901
This machine relays that
information to a robot,

14:27.935 --> 14:30.437
a superhuman robot.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.407
So your consciousness now sees
through the eyes of a robot

14:34.441 --> 14:37.911
with superhuman capability.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.413
NEGIN FARSAD:
I would love to check out

14:40.447 --> 14:44.851
the rings on Saturn or Neptune.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.288
Um, I'm just fascinated
by the ring.

14:48.321 --> 14:52.892
So, because the universe liked
it, so they put a ring on it.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.694
What? Why did I say that?

14:54.727 --> 14:59.532
I'm so embarrassed, but that,
it's also a valid joke.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.534
NARRATOR: There's another
factor to consider

15:01.568 --> 15:04.871
once we are spending all of our
time flying around the universe.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.373
Spaceships are going to become,

15:06.406 --> 15:10.410
for all intents and purposes,
our new homes.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.112
According to science fiction,

15:12.145 --> 15:15.582
those ships will either be
functional, industrial vessels,

15:15.615 --> 15:20.287
or flying luxury palaces.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.123
MEAD: 'Alien,' the first one,
in that film,

15:23.156 --> 15:26.326
the spaceship was sort of
a floating refinery,

15:26.359 --> 15:27.627
very mechanical,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.763
industrial-looking
piece of stuff.

15:30.797 --> 15:36.736
NICE: Me being a huge
Star Trek dweeb,

15:36.769 --> 15:41.274
what I really would like to see
is space travel reach a point

15:41.308 --> 15:45.912
where we leave this solar system
in comfort.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.250
I would love to see that like
where a city is built in space

15:50.283 --> 15:54.754
and then that city travels
to another solar system

15:54.787 --> 15:58.825
or that city moves out
to explore the universe

15:58.858 --> 16:00.493
with a bunch of Earthlings.

16:00.527 --> 16:06.499
So just imagine all of Manhattan
as a floating spaceship.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.769
NARRATOR: But comfort aside, the
real issue we've got to take on

16:09.802 --> 16:11.304
is how to get those ships

16:11.338 --> 16:14.174
to go into what Star Trek
called 'warp drive,'

16:14.207 --> 16:16.809
traveling at the speed of light.

16:16.843 --> 16:20.447
Without that, space travel is
definitely a lot trickier

16:20.480 --> 16:22.382
and infinitely slower.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.218
JON SPAIHTS:
To get the kind of travel

16:25.252 --> 16:28.555
that you see in the movies,
interstellar travel,

16:28.588 --> 16:30.157
is simply not possible

16:30.190 --> 16:33.993
by extrapolating from
the technologies we have.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.529
Getting any massive spacecraft

16:36.563 --> 16:39.899
to something approaching
the speed of light

16:39.932 --> 16:42.502
is a very tricky proposition.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.571
Your gas tank grows
bigger and bigger,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.139
and your spaceship balloons
ludicrously

16:46.173 --> 16:48.041
as you try to get close
to those speeds.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.044
And of course, it's complicated
by the fact that,

16:51.078 --> 16:53.846
as you start getting closer
to light speed,

16:53.880 --> 16:57.250
relativity rears its head.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.752
NEWITZ: I think space travel
is still going to be

16:59.786 --> 17:03.990
kind of grindy for a while,
take a long time,

17:04.023 --> 17:06.226
and, you know, you might take
a vacation on another world

17:06.259 --> 17:07.660
once in a while,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.830
but it would be kind of like,
you know,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.233
ship travel was 500 years ago,

17:13.266 --> 17:15.102
where you really
got to be committed

17:15.135 --> 17:17.737
if you want to go
across the Atlantic.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.539
FARSAD: I have such
motion sickness,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.741
like I really just don't think
I could make it in a spacecraft,

17:21.774 --> 17:23.510
like I would be a nightmare,

17:23.543 --> 17:27.847
and like no amount of Dramamine
would like help that situation.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.117
NARRATOR: Dramamine probably
won't help on a little jaunt

17:30.150 --> 17:32.785
to, say, the Andromeda I galaxy,

17:32.819 --> 17:35.588
which you could fly to
in 2.5 million years,

17:35.622 --> 17:37.357
if you could fly
at the speed of light.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.858
Which, right now, you can't,

17:38.891 --> 17:41.761
because of that pesky
theory of relativity.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.563
So, yes, you get it.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.099
Until we figure out
some big physics problems,

17:46.133 --> 17:48.735
intergalactic travel could
take a very long time.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.637
Which means we might
want to consider

17:50.670 --> 17:53.473
looking for a shortcut
through space.

17:53.506 --> 17:57.944
And that means wormholes.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.147
KAKU: If you could bend
the fabric of space and time,

18:00.180 --> 18:04.317
and rip it, you might be able
to take a shortcut, a wormhole,

18:04.351 --> 18:07.120
through the fabric
of space and time.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.922
Take a sheet of paper,
and then fold it

18:09.956 --> 18:12.592
so that two ends
meet in the middle,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.794
and you punch a hole
straight through.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
That is a wormhole.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.566
Like the looking glass of Alice.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.269
When Alice stuck her hand
in the looking glass,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.804
her hand went from
the countryside of Oxford

18:24.837 --> 18:27.740
to Wonderland.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.142
MATT MIRA: The Lincoln Tunnel
is a great example

18:29.176 --> 18:30.943
of what a wormhole
could be like,

18:30.977 --> 18:33.780
but you'd have to think of it
as the entrance and the exit

18:33.813 --> 18:38.017
of the Lincoln Tunnel being
the same point in space.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.752
If we can't figure out
warp speed,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.921
we'll have to figure out
how to create wormholes,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.591
because there's going to be
no way to travel

18:44.624 --> 18:48.961
such a great distance unless
we go through the wormhole.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.434
NARRATOR: That means you could
get from one point to another,

18:54.467 --> 18:55.935
thousands of light-years away

18:55.968 --> 18:58.871
as easily as walking
through a door.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.007
It's a little
too good to be true.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.276
Instead of sitting
in Los Angeles traffic,

19:03.310 --> 19:04.777
just walk through a wormhole

19:04.811 --> 19:07.013
and get to work
in about three seconds.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.982
That'd be a huge hit amongst
pretty much everyone

19:10.016 --> 19:13.286
who has ever taken
the 405 freeway.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.821
Maybe that's why
Hollywood has had

19:14.854 --> 19:17.790
such a long-standing love affair
with the wormhole.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.492
ROSE EVELETH: Hollywood loves to
use wormholes as kind of like

19:19.526 --> 19:22.229
a, oh, we need to get them
from one place to another,

19:22.262 --> 19:24.197
so we're going to do some,
like, cool visual effects,

19:24.231 --> 19:25.832
and we're going to send them
through the wormhole,

19:25.865 --> 19:27.534
and they're going to be
wherever they need to be.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.336
MIRA: I do like a wormhole.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.737
They're all over Star Trek.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.972
Deep Space Nine was the guardian
of that wormhole

19:33.005 --> 19:35.375
and sort of let ships
pass through

19:35.408 --> 19:39.412
and didn't let
ships pass through.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.348
NICE: I got a wormhole,
and I can go there.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.816
Hmm. I'm going to say Detroit.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
It's making a comeback!

19:45.385 --> 19:47.854
I'm telling you,
Detroit's making a comeback.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.889
I would love a wormhole that
could get me there and back

19:49.922 --> 19:51.057
with no problem.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.992
Mostly back.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.061
NARRATOR: If we could find
and use a wormhole,

19:55.094 --> 19:57.730
it could be the key to
opening up immediate travel

19:57.764 --> 20:00.600
to anywhere in the universe
we wanted to check out.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.769
NEWITZ: Like, we invent
something like jump gates

20:02.802 --> 20:06.273
or, you know, portable wormholes
or whatever,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.608
obviously all bets are off.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.410
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
It's a pretty cool idea.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.079
Like, I want a wormhole instead
of the New York City subway.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.525
NARRATOR: Oscar even installed
a wormhole in his living room

20:25.558 --> 20:28.060
to meet Eva at their
remote mountain getaway

20:28.094 --> 20:31.097
seven galaxies away.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.612
OSCAR: Eva?

20:45.645 --> 20:55.688
*

20:55.688 --> 21:04.130
*

21:04.163 --> 21:05.598
NARRATOR: We know Oscar
is a late adopter

21:05.632 --> 21:07.400
to all things future tech,

21:07.434 --> 21:09.068
but it looks like his wormhole
is something

21:09.101 --> 21:11.237
he'll be using
more often than not.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.306
EVA: Took you long enough.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.684
NARRATOR: There is, as always,
just one issue--

21:24.717 --> 21:27.787
traveling through a wormhole
could destabilize the tunnel,

21:27.820 --> 21:30.623
leaving any travelers
stranded or dead.

21:30.657 --> 21:34.594
Not exactly how you want an
intergalactic trip to turn out.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.995
EVELETH: And we certainly
wouldn't send

21:36.028 --> 21:38.264
something we cared about
into one.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.667
NARRATOR: Right, so let's add
'shoring up wormholes'

21:40.700 --> 21:42.835
to our to-do list.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.004
Interstellar and
intergalactic travel,

21:45.037 --> 21:48.975
where we travel in our,
uh, sorry, meat bodies,

21:49.008 --> 21:51.378
is going to take
a lot of scientific progress

21:51.411 --> 21:53.312
before it's a reality.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.349
As we develop technologies
to take us around the universe,

21:56.383 --> 21:58.317
we'll simultaneously
have to figure out

21:58.351 --> 22:00.520
how we will exist
on other planets.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.390
And that means
we'll change our DNA

22:03.423 --> 22:05.658
to suit the environment
around us,

22:05.692 --> 22:10.129
triggering something
called speciation.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.333
We'll be able to exist on a
planet that has, say, toxic air.

22:14.367 --> 22:18.405
The bad news is that
we won't be human anymore,

22:18.438 --> 22:20.907
but we'll get to that
in a minute.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.851
NARRATOR: Humanity is going
to try to explore

22:31.884 --> 22:33.520
intergalactic space,

22:33.553 --> 22:35.254
whether we do it on board
a spaceship,

22:35.287 --> 22:39.025
via artificial intelligence,
or through a wormhole.

22:39.058 --> 22:43.830
But getting out there beyond our
galaxy is only half the battle.

22:43.863 --> 22:47.600
The bigger question is how
humans are planning to survive

22:47.634 --> 22:51.704
wherever we decide
to hang our hats.

22:51.738 --> 22:55.508
KAKU: We will be able to tinker
with our genetic heritage.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.277
It's only a matter of time.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.713
NARRATOR: And that's when
humanity is going to start

23:00.747 --> 23:05.718
looking very different
than we do today.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.620
PHIL ROSEDALE: Space travel is
going to separate us

23:07.654 --> 23:09.288
into separate colonies,

23:09.321 --> 23:12.224
you know, that'll never
talk to each other again.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.526
DIAMANDIS: We're going to become

23:13.560 --> 23:15.428
a multitude of different
human species.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.798
We are going to speciate.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.133
NARRATOR: Meaning,
we'll deliberately mutate

23:21.167 --> 23:22.769
our genetic code

23:22.802 --> 23:26.305
to ensure an upgraded version
of our species survives

23:26.338 --> 23:29.609
what would be the toxic,
uninhabitable environment

23:29.642 --> 23:32.779
of an exoplanet.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.582
DIAMANDIS: We're going from
what has been Darwinism,

23:35.615 --> 23:39.986
evolution by natural selection,
to something different.

23:40.019 --> 23:44.824
Evolution by intelligent
direction, by our own desires.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.726
NEWITZ: People will have
modified their DNA

23:46.759 --> 23:50.162
to be more resistant
to cosmic radiation,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.431
or building bodies
that are better able

23:52.465 --> 23:54.000
to deal with low gravity.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.902
Or even more radically,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.070
modifying their
respiratory systems

23:58.104 --> 24:02.074
to actually be able to process
the Martian atmosphere.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.311
SANDBERG: If we go to space,
over time, of course,

24:05.344 --> 24:08.781
parts of humanity are going
to be very separated.

24:08.815 --> 24:13.486
And some people might indeed
go for very radical changes.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.689
FARSAD: It just sounds
entirely unpleasant

24:16.723 --> 24:18.658
to make a genetic modification
to myself,

24:18.691 --> 24:22.094
to be able to like breathe
Mars' air or whatever it is.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.765
I imagine it would involve
some sort of a hole

24:25.798 --> 24:29.301
in, like, placed in my person,
you know what I mean?

24:29.335 --> 24:34.173
I imagine some sort of a third
arm would need to be attached.

24:34.206 --> 24:38.845
Uh, what kind of clothes
would I wear with a third arm?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.647
NARRATOR: Totally hear you.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.784
But the need for a third arm may
not only be entirely necessary

24:44.817 --> 24:48.955
for survival,
it may even be fashionable.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.823
But let's not get sidetracked.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.225
The point is, right now, some
of the world's brightest minds

24:53.259 --> 24:55.227
are examining how extremophiles

24:55.261 --> 24:57.964
can survive even
the harshest conditions,

24:57.997 --> 25:02.068
conditions where life
shouldn't survive.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.502
When you think about it,

25:03.536 --> 25:05.204
we have already gotten
pretty comfortable

25:05.237 --> 25:07.907
with drastically modifying
our bodies--

25:07.940 --> 25:11.143
think cochlear implants,
heart transplants,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.979
and hip replacements.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.515
It's even tough to find someone
without a tattoo these days.

25:16.549 --> 25:20.252
But once we start changing our
bodies on a much larger level,

25:20.286 --> 25:22.421
like our half-fish friend,

25:22.454 --> 25:23.823
that's when you start
talking about

25:23.856 --> 25:28.060
the birth of a new species
beyond humanity.

25:28.094 --> 25:32.999
That group will become
post-humans.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.433
DVORSKY: A post-human could be

25:34.466 --> 25:38.037
a very radically redesigned
genetic human.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.072
CHURCH: We could
intentionally speciate,

25:40.106 --> 25:41.874
we could make ourselves
radiation resistant

25:41.908 --> 25:44.410
by just changing
a handful of genes,

25:44.443 --> 25:47.013
maybe as few as four genes.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.115
NARRATOR: That means the next
incarnation of humanity

25:49.148 --> 25:51.550
will be a little like
a pre-fab home--

25:51.584 --> 25:53.185
we'll design it ourselves

25:53.219 --> 25:55.421
and have it built
to our specifications

25:55.454 --> 25:58.357
to optimize our comfort in life.

25:58.390 --> 26:06.933
*

26:06.966 --> 26:09.736
But in order to survive on Mars
we have to learn

26:09.769 --> 26:12.972
how we could survive in
a Mars-like environment.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.070
NARRATOR: It was widely believed

26:44.103 --> 26:47.473
that the Red Planet look-alike
landscape of the Atacama Desert

26:47.506 --> 26:49.075
was sterile.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.879
And then Armando Bustos
discovered something remarkable.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.006
NARRATOR: That's what we call
in the business

27:20.039 --> 27:24.010
a scientific jackpot.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.477
Life was discovered in a place

27:25.511 --> 27:29.982
that, like Mars,
no one believed was possible.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.839
NARRATOR:
So if there is life here,

27:52.872 --> 27:55.207
could there be life up there?

27:55.241 --> 27:58.377
And more importantly, could
these tiny desert microorganisms

27:58.410 --> 28:00.646
show us how our bodies
can be adapted

28:00.679 --> 28:02.949
to live in the Mars environment?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.872
NARRATOR: Even if these little
organisms don't crack the code

28:25.905 --> 28:27.573
for making us Martians,

28:27.606 --> 28:29.175
studying them might help us

28:29.208 --> 28:33.880
live on the Red Planet
more comfortably.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.949
Okay, so once we're tearing
around in space,

28:36.983 --> 28:40.219
driving through wormholes
from one galaxy to another,

28:40.252 --> 28:43.122
that's when we may start
to bump into a few things

28:43.155 --> 28:46.926
that are truly mind-bending.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.729
For instance, what if every time
you made a decision,

28:50.763 --> 28:53.532
you didn't just leave behind
a road untraveled?

28:53.565 --> 28:59.238
What if that road spun off
and became a parallel universe?

28:59.271 --> 29:01.073
Makes that agonizing decision

29:01.107 --> 29:05.244
over what wireless plan to
choose kind of moot, doesn't it?

29:08.014 --> 29:09.448
NARRATOR:
As we travel ever closer

29:09.481 --> 29:11.784
to that Year Million scenario,

29:11.818 --> 29:16.755
let's take a quick look and
see just how far we've come.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.226
Space is now our playground.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.662
We've sent robots to every nook
and cranny of the universe,

29:23.695 --> 29:27.466
and we've even mastered
wormholes.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.001
We've developed new technologies

29:29.035 --> 29:31.938
to transcend huge distances
in space,

29:31.971 --> 29:34.773
and we've evolved our bodies.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.143
But the real mind-bender?

29:37.176 --> 29:41.447
We might find that we don't have
to travel beyond our doorstep

29:41.480 --> 29:44.283
to find alternative universes.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.187
EVELETH: The way that I imagine

29:48.220 --> 29:49.989
like the parallel universe
thing,

29:50.022 --> 29:53.592
is it's like, you know when you
wake up and you're in a dream?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.361
You're in your house, but
it's not actually your house,

29:55.394 --> 29:56.929
but it feels like your house.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.431
OSCAR: Hey, Oscar. You made it.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.000
EVELETH: You are in
this weird state,

30:01.033 --> 30:03.202
where you sort of are aware
that something is wrong,

30:03.235 --> 30:04.270
but everything feels right.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.038
[record scratches]

30:06.072 --> 30:09.141
Um, you know what? I don't,
I have no idea how this works.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.543
NICE: Hmm, let's see.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.980
There are some that see
a parallel universe

30:14.013 --> 30:17.884
as an infinite number
of universes

30:17.917 --> 30:21.153
that exist alongside of the one
that we live in,

30:21.187 --> 30:24.056
where things are
pretty much the same,

30:24.090 --> 30:26.525
but certain things
are different.

30:26.558 --> 30:30.229
OSCAR: I don't know what's real.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.865
OSCAR: It's all real.

30:32.899 --> 30:36.568
NICE: And I don't want to get
too much further into that,

30:36.602 --> 30:38.837
because I'll start
sounding stupid,

30:38.871 --> 30:42.174
'cause I don't know
what I'm talking about.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.911
NARRATOR: Looks like we're going
to have to turn to the big guns,

30:44.944 --> 30:48.047
or at least
to someone with a PhD.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.848
BRIAN GREENE:
So, in string theory,

30:49.882 --> 30:53.019
which is an attempt to realize
Einstein's dream

30:53.052 --> 30:56.188
of a unified theory
of all of nature's forces,

30:56.222 --> 31:00.759
we find the mathematics suggests
that our universe might be one

31:00.792 --> 31:03.195
of a grand collection of realms,

31:03.229 --> 31:08.200
each of which would rightly be
called a universe of its own.

31:08.234 --> 31:11.403
Perhaps the Big Bang,
which gave rise to our universe,

31:11.437 --> 31:13.439
was not a unique event.

31:13.472 --> 31:17.176
Maybe there are many big bangs,

31:17.209 --> 31:19.678
each giving rise
to its own universe.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.414
EVELETH: What, what, what?
I have some questions!

31:22.448 --> 31:24.616
NARRATOR: I think we all do.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.686
Is there a simpler way
to explain it?

31:27.719 --> 31:31.590
GREENE: I like to think of it
as though we are one bubble

31:31.623 --> 31:34.060
in a big cosmic bubble bath,

31:34.093 --> 31:37.729
where the other bubbles
are other universes.

31:37.763 --> 31:41.800
SPAIHTS: The exciting idea
about parallel universes

31:41.833 --> 31:46.472
is that in almost exactly the
same way, when a human is born,

31:46.505 --> 31:51.910
it's possible for an ovum
to split and form twins.

31:51.944 --> 31:56.115
It is possible to imagine, in
the birth agony of a universe,

31:56.148 --> 32:00.552
in that big bang, for that
explosion also to split.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.622
That means that there is another
universe just like ours,

32:03.655 --> 32:06.058
separated from us
by the thinnest of walls,

32:06.092 --> 32:11.563
if we only can learn how
to pierce it and cross over.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.266
THURSTON: Yeah, that's really,
that's just...

32:14.300 --> 32:17.069
My head's kind of spinning.
It's a funky idea.

32:17.103 --> 32:20.339
We could have a world
dominated by chimpanzees.

32:20.372 --> 32:24.776
We could have a world where
the Hindenburg didn't crash.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.013
NARRATOR: Multiple big bangs
isn't the only way

32:27.046 --> 32:29.815
to get to parallel universes.

32:29.848 --> 32:32.318
GREENE: The many worlds approach
to quantum physics

32:32.351 --> 32:38.590
says that the act of observation
winds up yielding two universes,

32:38.624 --> 32:41.293
one with one outcome
where you see one result,

32:41.327 --> 32:44.997
and another universe where
you see a different result.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.932
So this morning, when
you're trying to decide

32:46.965 --> 32:51.303
between pancakes and eggs,
and you chose eggs.

32:51.337 --> 32:55.441
In another universe,
you chose pancakes.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.009
MARTIN REES: Both options
are fulfilled,

32:57.043 --> 32:59.178
and the universe splits
into one way it did happen,

32:59.211 --> 33:01.147
one way it didn't.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.848
SPAIHTS: The most extreme notion

33:02.881 --> 33:07.553
is that we are forming universes
around us at every moment.

33:07.586 --> 33:11.157
That every atomic interaction,
every choice we make,

33:11.190 --> 33:12.791
every little thing that happens,

33:12.824 --> 33:17.196
creates an explosion
of universes from that moment.

33:17.229 --> 33:21.867
THURSTON: Maybe it's just
this infinite hall of mirrors.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.170
EVELETH: There's this idea
that these parallel universes

33:24.203 --> 33:25.704
sort of touch us every so often,

33:25.737 --> 33:27.906
and they slightly
tweak our reality.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.076
One example of this is that
there is a large group of people

33:30.109 --> 33:32.144
on the Internet who believe
that there was a movie

33:32.178 --> 33:35.314
at some point made
called Shazaam,

33:35.347 --> 33:37.683
which starred Sinbad as a genie.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.984
This movie does not exist.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.552
Sinbad has repeatedly been like,

33:40.586 --> 33:42.088
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.056
But there are all of these
people who remember

33:44.090 --> 33:47.926
and can describe the plot
from a movie called Shazaam.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.395
There is a movie called Kazaam,

33:49.428 --> 33:51.397
in which Shaquille O'Neal
is a genie.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.332
But that's not the movie
they're talking about.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.701
People really, truly believe
this thing exists.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.336
And some small subset
of those people

33:57.369 --> 33:59.838
believe that they actually
have crossed over

33:59.871 --> 34:03.008
from a parallel universe,
in which Shazaam existed.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.110
That's literally,
I swear to God,

34:04.143 --> 34:07.246
that's literally the theory.

34:07.279 --> 34:11.917
I'm not making this up.
I did not make this up.

34:11.950 --> 34:15.754
NARRATOR: So is this just
an Internet conspiracy,

34:15.787 --> 34:20.859
or our best documented evidence
of a parallel universe?

34:20.892 --> 34:24.130
Could there really be
multiple universes

34:24.163 --> 34:27.933
bumping into one another
and shapeshifting around us?

34:27.966 --> 34:30.102
N.K. JEMISIN: I can't see
why it wouldn't exist.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.070
The more that we come
to understand our universe,

34:32.104 --> 34:34.273
the more we realize
it's much more complex.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.608
Things like time
are much more complex

34:36.642 --> 34:38.310
than we thought that they were.

34:38.344 --> 34:41.547
So why wouldn't the universe
be more complex, too?

34:41.580 --> 34:44.049
THURSTON: I think the value
of many universes theory

34:44.082 --> 34:45.551
is that it's a reminder

34:45.584 --> 34:48.154
that we can choose to live
in different ways,

34:48.187 --> 34:52.624
and that the way we exist
isn't the way we have to.

34:52.658 --> 34:56.262
NARRATOR: In fact, if there
really are parallel universes,

34:56.295 --> 34:57.996
then we are all living
all possibilities

34:58.029 --> 35:00.899
in another universe
somewhere else.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.769
KAKU: Many people come up to me
and say, 'Professor,

35:03.802 --> 35:05.737
if there are parallel universes,

35:05.771 --> 35:08.474
then is Elvis Presley
still alive

35:08.507 --> 35:11.510
in one of these
parallel universes?'

35:11.543 --> 35:13.979
And the answer is,
you can't rule it out.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.781
There could be
a certain probability,

35:15.814 --> 35:21.920
calculable probability that,
yes, the king is still alive.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.789
GREENE: Because all
of the possible outcomes

35:23.822 --> 35:27.092
of every experiment, every
observation, every happening,

35:27.125 --> 35:31.930
they all take place, just
in their own distinct universe.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.365
SPAIHTS: There may be

35:33.399 --> 35:37.203
a literally infinite number
of universes.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.872
That is to say that everything
that could be possible

35:40.906 --> 35:43.309
somewhere is real.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.876
Right next door,
through the membrane

35:44.910 --> 35:48.847
separating this bubble
from that bubble.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.718
NARRATOR: So the big question
is, how do we get there?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.621
Can we reach other universes?

35:55.654 --> 35:58.324
SPAIHTS: How to leap from
this bubble to that bubble,

35:58.357 --> 36:03.895
is a mystery for future science
or for the black arts,

36:03.929 --> 36:05.497
or for a science fiction writer

36:05.531 --> 36:09.635
to speculate
irresponsibly about.

36:09.668 --> 36:14.506
NARRATOR: So, maybe not now,
or in the near future,

36:14.540 --> 36:19.311
but in Year Million,
maybe, just maybe,

36:19.345 --> 36:24.416
humanity will discover a way
to travel between universes.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.518
Even now, scientists speculate

36:26.552 --> 36:31.089
that those massive gravitational
fields where light goes to die,

36:31.122 --> 36:36.328
may be portals through which
we can reach other universes.

36:36.362 --> 36:38.063
DVORSKY: We might be able
to exploit black holes,

36:38.096 --> 36:41.099
and how that could be a gateway
to, you know, another realm

36:41.132 --> 36:43.835
that's separate from
this current universe.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.871
That holds some promise.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.774
KAKU: The mathematics says
that a spinning black hole

36:48.807 --> 36:52.611
collapses to a ring,
a ring of neutrons.

36:52.644 --> 36:56.047
If you stick your hand through
the ring of spinning neutrons,

36:56.081 --> 36:59.117
you wind up on another universe.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.019
It's bizarre.

37:01.052 --> 37:04.456
It's mind-shattering,
if you think about it.

37:04.490 --> 37:10.028
But it's something that we
physicists take very seriously.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.431
NARRATOR: Once we are able
to pierce the veil

37:12.464 --> 37:14.866
and travel from one universe
to the other,

37:14.900 --> 37:19.538
then there are literally
no limits for us.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.140
Even if black holes
are our pathway

37:22.173 --> 37:25.043
to this final frontier
of exploration,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.446
there is plenty more
to figure out.

37:27.479 --> 37:31.750
Like getting a grip on the most
mysterious and pervasive

37:31.783 --> 37:34.152
concept of them all,

37:34.185 --> 37:36.455
one that has baffled scientists

37:36.488 --> 37:40.326
since they first realized
it may exist.

37:40.359 --> 37:44.330
Because dark matter is
just plain bizarre,

37:44.363 --> 37:47.232
and it might be the answer

37:47.265 --> 37:51.202
to absolutely everything
in the universe.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.108
NARRATOR: We've traveled into
outer space, through wormholes,

37:57.142 --> 37:59.411
and into parallel universes.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.613
But the biggest, most important
discovery of all

38:01.647 --> 38:04.450
may actually be all around you.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.452
But you can't see it.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.920
KAKU: Every high school textbook
in science

38:08.954 --> 38:11.957
says that the universe is
mainly made out of atoms.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.191
Wrong.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.826
We now know that
most of the universe

38:14.860 --> 38:18.497
is not mainly made out of atoms.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.532
NARRATOR: Instead,
the universe is made up

38:20.566 --> 38:23.869
of something called dark matter.

38:23.902 --> 38:28.139
And it is the holy grail
of science.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.141
KAKU: Dark matter is
invisible matter

38:30.175 --> 38:32.310
that holds the galaxy together.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.613
If I have dark matter
in my hand right now,

38:34.646 --> 38:37.449
first of all, it would be
invisible, but it has gravity.

38:37.483 --> 38:40.185
But it would literally sift
right through my fingers,

38:40.218 --> 38:42.354
'cause it has no interactions
with atoms,

38:42.388 --> 38:44.356
go all the way down to
the center of the Earth,

38:44.390 --> 38:46.625
all the way down to China.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.126
NARRATOR: We don't know
too many concrete facts

38:48.159 --> 38:49.995
about dark matter.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.297
We don't even know what it
looks like or how it is made.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.200
We just have an idea
of what it does.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.136
And this incognito stuff
is definitely doing

38:58.169 --> 39:01.306
some heavy lifting,
universe-wise.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.308
MIRA: No one's ever observed it.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.544
It's not been seen by anybody.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.178
But we just know,

39:07.212 --> 39:13.151
based on, you know,
the movement of regular matter

39:13.184 --> 39:14.986
that it should be there.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.689
You can't scan it,
you can't see it,

39:17.723 --> 39:19.825
we just have to assume
that it's there

39:19.858 --> 39:22.828
based on the movements
of everything else.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.996
NARRATOR: Okay, but what is it?

39:25.030 --> 39:27.065
Is it bigger than
a bread basket?

39:27.098 --> 39:32.704
Is it hard or soft,
black or white or blue?

39:32.738 --> 39:34.406
KAKU: I personally think
that dark matter

39:34.440 --> 39:39.545
is a higher vibration
of tiny little strings.

39:39.578 --> 39:43.048
There's another theory, however,
and that is dark matter

39:43.081 --> 39:47.719
is perhaps ordinary matter
hovering in a parallel universe.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.856
DVORSKY: So, dark matter...
oh, boy.

39:50.889 --> 39:56.762
NICE: So, dark matter is when
Lord Voldemort invokes...

39:56.795 --> 39:59.698
No.
[laughs]

39:59.731 --> 40:01.232
What is that force?

40:01.266 --> 40:03.368
We can't see clearly what it is.

40:03.401 --> 40:07.372
We see darkly what it is.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.642
KAKU: If one of you ever figure
this out, what is dark matter,

40:10.676 --> 40:12.410
be sure to tell me first,

40:12.444 --> 40:15.380
and we can share
the Nobel Prize together.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.117
NARRATOR: So we can see how hard
dark matter is on the brain.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.753
Here's the thumbnail sketch
on dark matter--

40:21.787 --> 40:24.756
something is holding the
universe together with gravity.

40:24.790 --> 40:28.994
And that something,
the theory goes, is dark matter.

40:29.027 --> 40:33.499
We know it is there only because
we can see what it does.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.133
GREENE: Stars should be
flying off,

40:35.166 --> 40:37.669
sort of like water droplets
on a bicycle rim.

40:37.703 --> 40:41.406
You spin the rim, the water
flies off, but they're not.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.243
We believe that dark matter is
what's holding it all together.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.480
Dark matter, we believe,
are likely to be particles

40:48.514 --> 40:50.682
that are wafting through space,

40:50.716 --> 40:54.586
that we believe provide the
additional gravitational pull

40:54.620 --> 40:56.688
in a spinning galaxy.

40:56.722 --> 41:00.458
NICE: I mean, dark matter,
that sounds like my entire life.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.428
I know about 4% of my life.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.132
The other 96%, I am just
trying to figure out.

41:07.165 --> 41:11.970
And that's maybe why I like
dark matter so much.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.773
NARRATOR: So we can't
visualize it or define it,

41:14.806 --> 41:17.042
which makes answering
any questions about it

41:17.075 --> 41:18.644
almost impossible.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.879
But scientists are doing
everything they can

41:20.912 --> 41:24.415
to make a little bit
of this stuff themselves.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.220
Deep underground,

41:29.254 --> 41:31.990
at the European Council
for Nuclear Research,

41:32.023 --> 41:35.894
sits the largest machine
on the planet.

41:35.927 --> 41:41.867
This, my friends, is the famed
Large Hadron Collider.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.902
This giant tube could reveal

41:43.935 --> 41:47.973
all the secrets
to the known universe.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.175
GREENE: The Large Hadron
Collider has the capacity,

41:50.208 --> 41:53.679
at least in principle,
to be a dark matter factory.

41:53.712 --> 41:58.016
Because what it does is
it slams protons together.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.552
After they cycle around
an 18-mile-long tunnel,

42:00.586 --> 42:03.589
they slam together
near the speed of light.

42:03.622 --> 42:06.558
And we believe that some of
the energy from those collisions

42:06.592 --> 42:10.562
can go into producing
particles of dark matter.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.197
JILL HEINERTH:
Smashing particles

42:12.230 --> 42:15.366
in the Large Hadron Collider
might be the next step

42:15.400 --> 42:18.069
to discovering, you know,
what's happening

42:18.103 --> 42:21.907
in the rest of dark matter,
in quantum physics.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.174
NICE: There are
certain particles

42:23.208 --> 42:25.010
that we are looking for,

42:25.043 --> 42:29.581
and the Large Hadron Collider
helps us find these particles.

42:29.615 --> 42:34.385
One was the Higgs boson,
which we found,

42:34.419 --> 42:36.187
and when I say we, I mean me,

42:36.221 --> 42:39.357
because I was heading up
that project.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.060
Thank you, you're welcome.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.595
[laughs]

42:45.764 --> 42:47.565
NARRATOR:
Thank you for that, Chuck.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.801
Scientists have used
the Hadron Collider

42:49.835 --> 42:53.304
to essentially recreate
the conditions of the Big Bang.

42:53.338 --> 42:57.208
That's when dark matter
was theoretically born.

42:57.242 --> 43:00.245
The Hadron Collider could
potentially generate dark matter

43:00.278 --> 43:05.150
so we could poke it and prod it
and just maybe understand it.

43:05.183 --> 43:07.285
Because if we comprehend
dark matter,

43:07.318 --> 43:08.887
we could figure out things

43:08.920 --> 43:11.657
about how the universe works
that have eluded us.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.793
Dark matter could show us how
to bend the laws of physics,

43:14.826 --> 43:18.329
and let us travel
at the speed of light.

43:18.363 --> 43:23.334
And it could be the answer to,
well, everything.

43:23.368 --> 43:26.838
MIRA: Eventually, it could
affect all of humanity.

43:26.872 --> 43:29.274
SPAIHTS: If we are trying
to reach other stars,

43:29.307 --> 43:30.976
then we're going
to need something

43:31.009 --> 43:33.779
down at the root level of
reality to sink our hooks into,

43:33.812 --> 43:35.947
to invent that new technology.

43:35.981 --> 43:37.816
And what dark matter tells us is

43:37.849 --> 43:40.652
there's something about
the makeup of the cosmos

43:40.686 --> 43:43.421
that will,
when we understand it,

43:43.454 --> 43:47.258
tell us something fundamentally
new about the world.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.694
GREENE: We're getting close,
we think,

43:48.727 --> 43:51.129
to understanding the basic laws.

43:51.162 --> 43:54.666
But as I say that, I know that
nature loves to just grab us

43:54.700 --> 43:57.769
and slap us in the face and say,
'Get rid of that hubris,

43:57.803 --> 44:00.271
you don't actually
understand anything.'

44:00.305 --> 44:02.841
NARRATOR: To that point, there
are a few out there who believe

44:02.874 --> 44:06.611
that the Hadron Collider could
inadvertently cause a black hole

44:06.644 --> 44:10.982
that would swallow up the
universe and everything in it.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.884
THURSTON: Yeah, that would suck.

44:12.918 --> 44:16.121
It's like, oops,
I destroyed the universe.

44:16.154 --> 44:19.825
We're monkeying around
with some powerful forces,

44:19.858 --> 44:22.660
and you know, so we're like
kids playing with matches.

44:22.694 --> 44:25.496
You know, maybe we'll
burn our house down.

44:25.530 --> 44:28.033
NARRATOR: Well, the Swiss are
known for their precision,

44:28.066 --> 44:29.567
so here's hoping that they keep

44:29.600 --> 44:33.371
their Hadron Collider
well in line.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.073
Also, you'll be happy to hear

44:35.106 --> 44:37.375
that it's
an unsubstantiated theory

44:37.408 --> 44:39.711
that the Earth will get
swallowed by a black hole.

44:39.745 --> 44:45.383
If not, well, you'll be
amongst the first to know.

44:45.416 --> 44:48.653
This invisible, mysterious stuff
could crack every code

44:48.686 --> 44:50.655
that's stumped scientists.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.691
It could show us how to build
an intergalactic spaceship

44:53.725 --> 44:56.862
or even how to travel
through space and time.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.596
And if we figure out
how to access

44:58.629 --> 45:00.531
and manipulate it earlier,

45:00.565 --> 45:03.101
that Year Million era
could be happening

45:03.134 --> 45:05.370
a hell of a lot sooner.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.338
But once we've mastered
dark matter,

45:07.372 --> 45:10.842
it's not like our journey
will end there.

45:10.876 --> 45:15.380
In our quest for knowledge, we
will change humanity's destiny.

45:15.413 --> 45:19.017
Every new discovery leads
to another mystery.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.020
Every question inspires
some brave soul

45:22.053 --> 45:25.891
to set off on a journey
to explore the unknown.

45:25.924 --> 45:28.593
It is what has led us
every step of the way

45:28.626 --> 45:33.765
on our incredible journey
to the Year Million.

45:33.799 --> 45:36.467
When we arrive
at that future point,

45:36.501 --> 45:38.904
we will have built
artificial intelligence.

45:38.937 --> 45:40.371
JESS: Hi, Dad.

45:40.405 --> 45:43.441
NARRATOR: We'll communicate
telepathically.

45:43.474 --> 45:45.476
[muffled conservation]

45:45.510 --> 45:47.745
We'll not only
reengineer our DNA

45:47.779 --> 45:50.949
to resist all life-threatening
diseases and viruses,

45:50.982 --> 45:52.217
we'll be able to create

45:52.250 --> 45:54.986
the ultimate sustainable
biological body,

45:55.020 --> 45:59.124
designed to our exact
specifications.

45:59.157 --> 46:02.961
Then there may be a time when
our descendants will choose

46:02.994 --> 46:06.131
to discard their physical bodies

46:06.164 --> 46:09.835
and live as a giant
digital collective

46:09.868 --> 46:13.038
inside the metaverse.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.310
We may look totally different,

46:19.344 --> 46:24.615
since we've altered ourselves to
be able to colonize new planets.

46:24.649 --> 46:27.118
And even beyond mere cosmetics,

46:27.152 --> 46:29.620
we could be uploaded
into the digital realm,

46:29.654 --> 46:34.592
living immortal lives inside
the massive Dyson sphere.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.362
And parallel universes
and dark matter

46:37.395 --> 46:39.931
all became a reality.

46:39.965 --> 46:42.667
Every step
in humanity's maturation

46:42.700 --> 46:45.436
has led to a more fantastical
leap forward

46:45.470 --> 46:47.438
in our technological development

46:47.472 --> 46:50.541
and our understanding
of the universe.

46:50.575 --> 46:54.379
What will the next million years
after that be?

46:54.412 --> 46:57.015
Only our imaginations can tell.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.850
And if there's one thing I know,

46:58.884 --> 47:03.654
it's that the human imagination
is thrillingly limitless.
