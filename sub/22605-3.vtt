WOMAN: I've already been down this street.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.966
DISTORTED MALE VOICE (over
earpiece): Keep walking.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.535
(dog barking in distance)

00:19.536 --> 00:22.238
Hello?

00:22.239 --> 00:23.939
Remove the battery from your phone

00:23.940 --> 00:26.341
and put it in the dumpster.

00:29.411 --> 00:31.013
No.

00:31.014 --> 00:31.855
It's a burner.

00:31.856 --> 00:34.617
No one's tracking it.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.984
Not negotiable.

00:40.990 --> 00:42.491
How do I know you're really Viper?

00:42.492 --> 00:45.194
How do I know it's not a trap?

00:45.195 --> 00:47.595
Do it.

01:03.145 --> 01:06.347
(creaking)

01:08.117 --> 01:10.585
♪

01:21.163 --> 01:25.066
Hello?

01:28.237 --> 01:29.971
(clattering)

01:31.907 --> 01:33.943
Where are you? Damn it.

01:33.944 --> 01:35.678
Gina Fisher.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.246
You made it.

01:39.582 --> 01:41.549
You're Viper?

01:42.585 --> 01:46.120
What I got is going to bring
the United States to its knees.

01:48.657 --> 01:53.229
They say Thomas Jefferson,
your first Secretary of State, _

01:53.230 --> 01:59.150
shared a bottle of this 1788
Clos DE Griffier cognac

01:59.151 --> 02:02.566
with my predecessor
Jean Baptiste Ternant

02:02.567 --> 02:04.582
who, um, didn't realize

02:04.583 --> 02:08.335
that Jefferson was, uh,
really a wine aficionado.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.645
(scattered chuckles)

02:09.645 --> 02:12.114
However, our research

02:12.115 --> 02:14.550
of you, Madam Secretary,

02:14.551 --> 02:19.622
uh, suggests that you will find
this cognac more pleasing.

02:19.623 --> 02:22.958
Merci, Minister Dubois.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.593
Your research is correct.

02:24.594 --> 02:26.495
(scattered chuckles)

02:26.496 --> 02:30.599
And although Jefferson may
not have loved cognac,

02:30.600 --> 02:32.534
he loved France.

02:32.535 --> 02:35.763
And our enduring alliance is a
testament to our shared values

02:35.764 --> 02:38.140
and profound friendship.

02:38.141 --> 02:38.913
Thank you.

02:38.914 --> 02:41.043
DAISY: The Secretary and
French Foreign Minister

02:41.044 --> 02:43.479
will now take ten minutes of questions.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.355
(reporters shouting)

02:44.356 --> 02:46.563
Gina Fisher, from the
<i>Washington Chronicle.</i>

02:46.564 --> 02:49.505
Madam Secretary, you say that
the U.S. and France are friends,

02:49.506 --> 02:52.682
yet your senior policy advisor,
Jay Whitman, has referred

02:52.683 --> 02:54.990
to Minister Dubois here as, quote,

02:54.991 --> 02:57.593
"An empty crepe with a Napoleon complex."

02:57.594 --> 02:59.228
(reporters murmuring)

02:59.229 --> 03:01.329
What do you have to say about that?

03:04.233 --> 03:05.317
I don't know anything about it.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.856
- Next question.
<i>- It's from a confidential</i>

03:06.857 --> 03:11.865
state department cable. I've gotten
access to a cache of such communiqués,

03:11.866 --> 03:14.518
including evidence of
U.S. spying on France

03:14.519 --> 03:15.969
and other so-called allies,

03:15.970 --> 03:19.631
exposing vast institutionalized hypocrisy.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.895
All of which will be going up
on the <i>Chronicle's</i> Web site

03:21.896 --> 03:23.788
as we speak.

03:23.789 --> 03:26.420
(reporters shouting)

03:33.429 --> 03:34.997
JAY: <i>It was a private e-mail!</i>

03:34.998 --> 03:37.328
You really believe there's
such a thing anymore?

03:37.329 --> 03:38.162
There's thousands.

03:38.163 --> 03:40.135
Twitter-sphere is calling
them the Viper cables.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.170
Viper?

03:41.171 --> 03:42.538
Fisher's source.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.606
She's claiming he's a state
department employee.

03:44.607 --> 03:46.219
Oh, great, our very own Snowden.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.968
What happened to at least
giving us a heads up?

03:47.969 --> 03:49.385
Hey, Jay.

03:49.386 --> 03:50.770
Daisy's about to tell us

03:50.771 --> 03:53.349
that that gotcha video is
blowing up on social media.

03:53.350 --> 03:55.074
Which was clearly the point.

03:55.075 --> 03:57.958
Right now, I need you
to focus on fixing it.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.170
The White House agrees.

03:59.171 --> 04:00.324
They want this contained.

04:00.535 --> 04:02.758
DAISY: Dubois officially
cut short his visit

04:02.759 --> 04:03.836
and is on his way to Andrews.

04:03.837 --> 04:05.402
Dubois's the tip of the iceberg.

04:05.403 --> 04:07.466
In another cable, an
INR analyst referred

04:07.467 --> 04:10.229
to the Austrian ambassador as <i>Das Boob.</i>

04:10.230 --> 04:12.514
Several deputy assistant
secretaries agreed

04:12.515 --> 04:13.556
in an e-mail chain

04:13.557 --> 04:16.434
that a member of the Peruvian
Constitutional Tribunal

04:16.435 --> 04:18.958
is a coked-up, narcissist blowhard.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.620
Oh, and our ambassador to Kenya called

04:20.620 --> 04:24.250
their defense minister a
sweaty, brain-damaged hippo.

04:24.251 --> 04:26.567
Are we sure those cables
aren't from a frat?

04:26.568 --> 04:28.430
Already crafting your apologies, ma'am.

04:28.431 --> 04:30.537
On a scale of non-apology-apology

04:30.538 --> 04:31.687
to full Swaggart-Kanye,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.288
how far do you want to take it?

04:33.289 --> 04:35.023
Feel your way through,

04:35.024 --> 04:37.025
based on diplomatic importance.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.578
Aside from the petty name-calling,

04:38.579 --> 04:41.296
is there anything policy-related
we need to worry about?

04:41.297 --> 04:42.464
I'll get into that.

04:42.465 --> 04:45.084
While you're at it, get
with FBI, DOJ and DNI,

04:45.085 --> 04:47.006
and see if they can
figure out who Viper is.

04:47.007 --> 04:49.505
And short of ID'ing him among
our thousands of colleagues,

04:49.506 --> 04:51.906
I want an estimate of
his security clearance.

04:55.244 --> 04:57.240
I'll write up your apology
to Foreign Minister Dubois,

04:57.241 --> 04:59.347
but he may require more than contrition.

04:59.349 --> 05:01.250
Understood.

05:01.251 --> 05:04.272
For now, Madam Secretary,
I hope you like crow.

05:04.273 --> 05:07.589
'Cause that's the only
dish on the menu today.

05:07.590 --> 05:10.205
It is upsetting and deeply concerning

05:10.206 --> 05:12.942
when so-called friends are uncivil,

05:12.943 --> 05:16.529
condescending and downright mean-spirited.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.112
I-I understand.

05:18.113 --> 05:22.738
Please accept my heartfelt
apologies, Ambassador Reinhart.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.375
Petty name-calling has no
place in our discourse.

05:26.376 --> 05:27.609
I have such great respect

05:27.610 --> 05:29.411
for all the work that you've done

05:29.412 --> 05:31.480
on behalf of women and the elderly.

05:31.481 --> 05:33.048
I'm very sorry.

05:33.049 --> 05:36.117
Very well, Madam Secretary.

05:41.857 --> 05:43.525
That's all we have for now.

05:43.526 --> 05:45.861
Only 47 apologies?

05:45.862 --> 05:48.597
I was just getting warmed up.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.698
(chuckles)

05:49.699 --> 05:50.833
How'd I do?

05:50.834 --> 05:53.535
No one's launched any
missiles at us, yet.

05:53.536 --> 05:54.332
(chuckles)

05:54.333 --> 05:56.476
But Ms. Fisher's announced
that she's posting

05:56.477 --> 05:59.150
another set of Viper's
cables tomorrow afternoon,

05:59.151 --> 06:01.710
and she's claiming they're
much worse than the first.

06:01.711 --> 06:02.945
Any headway on Viper?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.346
No I.D.

06:04.347 --> 06:08.150
But INR estimates he's no more
than Secret level clearance.

06:08.151 --> 06:11.846
They doubt he even had access
privileges to the seventh floor.

06:11.847 --> 06:14.803
Then why is the <i>Washington
Chronicle</i> making

06:14.804 --> 06:16.692
such a big splash?

06:17.993 --> 06:20.207
Reach out to Fisher.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.640
I want her in my office
first thing in the morning.

06:23.641 --> 06:27.202
Tell her I'll give her an
interview if you have to.

06:27.203 --> 06:30.619
Isn't that beneath your
dignity, Madam Secretary?

06:30.620 --> 06:33.186
The dignity train has
already left the station.

06:33.187 --> 06:36.523
Have Daisy put together
background on her for me.

06:36.524 --> 06:37.946
How deep?

06:37.947 --> 06:41.483
The Constitution shouldn't be violated.

06:41.484 --> 06:45.586
Let's make that an
assumption from now on.

06:49.191 --> 06:51.927
Hey! I can't believe you're still up.

06:51.928 --> 06:53.681
I heard all about <i>your</i> day.

06:53.682 --> 06:55.375
It was all over the news.

06:55.376 --> 06:56.765
Tell me about the kids.

06:56.766 --> 06:58.399
(falsetto): They're great.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.535
Seriously? The high voice?

07:01.536 --> 07:02.905
What's wrong?

07:02.906 --> 07:04.606
I didn't want to pile on your problems.

07:04.607 --> 07:06.608
Josh broke up with Alison.

07:06.609 --> 07:07.776
Oh, no.

07:07.777 --> 07:09.044
Is she a puddle?

07:09.045 --> 07:12.379
She hasn't really mentioned
anything about it yet.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.484
You didn't.

07:15.485 --> 07:16.465
I did.

07:16.466 --> 07:18.736
I thought we said we weren't
going to do that anymore.

07:18.737 --> 07:19.920
I know.

07:19.921 --> 07:21.993
So the little dweeb broke
up with her in a text?

07:21.994 --> 07:24.159
Yeah, with all kinds of
weird auto-correct things,

07:24.160 --> 07:25.826
but, yeah, his intent was clear.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.734
Honey, Alison's 15.

07:27.735 --> 07:30.065
W-We can't be spying
on her texts anymore.

07:30.066 --> 07:31.433
Can we?

07:31.434 --> 07:32.556
Hey, was it really our fault

07:32.557 --> 07:34.563
that my iPad somehow
tied in with her phone?

07:34.564 --> 07:37.132
And it's not like these
were icky diary entries.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.741
They're stuff that she's
sharing with her friends.

07:38.742 --> 07:40.008
- That's true.
- We're great parents.

07:40.009 --> 07:40.759
We are.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.239
It's our responsibility to balance
her privacy with her safety.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.780
She's at a precarious age.

07:44.781 --> 07:47.115
- Fifteen.
- We spy because we love.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.682
Like the U.S. on France.

07:50.385 --> 07:52.287
Much, much too soon, right?

07:52.288 --> 07:57.459
Ugh. At least we'll know what
to expect from Hurricane Alison.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.760
Yeah. Oh, and don't be surprised

07:58.761 --> 08:00.996
by the giant "V" that
Jason painted on his door.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.531
Viper's his new hero.

08:02.532 --> 08:04.266
Not surprised.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.267
And Stevie?

08:05.268 --> 08:06.702
Quietly reveling in your problems.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.503
Remind me again why we had kids?

08:11.239 --> 08:13.008
They were supposed to be cute.

08:13.009 --> 08:15.911
Come on, Mom, you got to admit
that government transparency

08:15.912 --> 08:18.246
is worth you getting
a little beat up over.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.349
No, I don't.

08:19.350 --> 08:22.743
You wrote scholarly papers
slamming the CIA for torture.

08:22.744 --> 08:24.252
That was different... it was torture.

08:24.253 --> 08:27.965
So, you think spying on our
allies is a good thing?

08:27.966 --> 08:30.096
No, I think it isn't torture.

08:30.097 --> 08:31.727
Feta and spinach omelet up.

08:31.728 --> 08:32.443
Thanks, Dad.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.918
You got it. Hey!

08:33.919 --> 08:34.956
How's school, Noodle?

08:34.957 --> 08:36.465
It's fine.

08:36.466 --> 08:38.700
Why don't you ask me about school?

08:38.701 --> 08:40.524
Because you would just rail

08:40.525 --> 08:42.136
against the oppression of learning.

08:42.138 --> 08:43.105
Yeah, your words.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.573
So, I got a job yesterday.

08:45.774 --> 08:47.577
Hey, that's fantastic.

08:47.578 --> 08:49.011
The copywriting job?

08:49.012 --> 08:50.811
No, the hostessing job.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.415
Hostessing? As in?

08:53.416 --> 08:56.151
As in, "Party of four? Right this way."

08:56.152 --> 08:57.386
Frank's Steak House.

08:57.387 --> 08:58.787
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.572
Frank's...

08:59.573 --> 09:01.083
Yeah, a lot of important people go there.

09:01.084 --> 09:03.325
Yep, and I will be showing
them to their tables.

09:03.326 --> 09:04.459
Cool. Do we get free steak?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.660
No. Just like no free rides.

09:07.963 --> 09:10.232
I'm the one who decided
to drop out of school.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.700
I can't blame you guys for
making me pull my weight.

09:14.169 --> 09:18.072
(phone rings)

09:19.208 --> 09:20.233
Hello.

09:21.544 --> 09:23.645
It's the Russian Foreign
Minister's office.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.680
(sighs) Great.

09:24.681 --> 09:26.415
How did they get our home number?

09:26.416 --> 09:28.450
Russia.

09:28.451 --> 09:29.584
Uh, really?

09:29.585 --> 09:30.281
Okay, yeah.

09:30.282 --> 09:31.687
Hold on one second.

09:31.688 --> 09:32.654
Not for you.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.690
- He wants to meet me.
- Gorev?

09:34.691 --> 09:37.359
He wants to talk about my
Orthodox Church schisms article.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.660
Cool.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.796
Come on, it's obviously
a ploy to get to you.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.043
Go. Guy's a powerhouse in Russia,

09:43.044 --> 09:45.400
second in line for the president.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.769
It'll be a kinky story that you met him.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.603
Just don't give away Latvia.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.311
You have another 23 apology
calls to make this morning.

09:56.312 --> 09:57.813
Good morning, Nadine.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.649
Oh. You really want to start
with that every morning?

10:00.650 --> 10:03.285
I guess I'm old-fashioned that way.

10:03.286 --> 10:04.953
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

10:04.954 --> 10:07.489
Ms. Fisher from the <i>Washington</i>
<i>Chronicle</i> is waiting for you.

10:07.490 --> 10:08.724
Thank you.

10:08.725 --> 10:09.648
Do I need to remind you

10:09.649 --> 10:13.328
that anything you say to her
could wind up all over the news?

10:13.329 --> 10:14.663
Don't worry.

10:14.664 --> 10:16.997
I'm pretty good at talking to people.

10:20.569 --> 10:22.270
Have a seat.

10:22.271 --> 10:25.207
I get why you brought me in here.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.939
So I'll feel intimidated.

10:26.940 --> 10:28.507
To soften me up.

10:29.203 --> 10:30.912
That thought might've crossed my mind.

10:30.913 --> 10:32.848
You think I'm a traitor.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.717
I don't know what to
make of you, Ms. Fisher.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.642
The latest Gallup poll has 52
percent of Americans thinking

10:39.643 --> 10:42.230
that Viper is providing an
important perspective

10:42.231 --> 10:44.726
on what's really happening
behind American power.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.862
They think he's a patriot.

10:46.863 --> 10:50.069
I'm all for transparency, but not this.

10:50.070 --> 10:53.268
Not giving away state
secrets haphazardly.

10:53.269 --> 10:54.369
And isn't it beneath you

10:54.370 --> 10:56.338
to print the petty, trite garbage

10:56.339 --> 10:58.106
of a Secret-level analyst?

10:58.107 --> 10:59.641
Who says he's only Secret level?

10:59.642 --> 11:03.011
INR analyzed the cables.

11:03.012 --> 11:06.647
They're nothing more than the
<i>TMZ</i> of political reporting.

11:07.983 --> 11:09.508
INR has it wrong.

11:09.509 --> 11:11.486
You won't be saying that
after the next release.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.588
Oh, come on, Gina.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.190
Your source wouldn't be invited

11:15.191 --> 11:17.392
to sit in the Situation
Room on a Saturday morning

11:17.393 --> 11:18.460
to watch cartoons.

11:18.461 --> 11:20.428
He's Top Secret SCI.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.107
Cleared for compartmentalized access
to more programs than I can count,

11:23.108 --> 11:24.729
and you're going to have
to do a hell of lot more

11:24.730 --> 11:27.167
than apologize when the next cables hit.

11:31.139 --> 11:35.142
I am so sorry, Madam Secretary.

11:36.044 --> 11:38.547
So long I have you on the defensive,

11:38.548 --> 11:39.848
will you give us a week

11:39.849 --> 11:41.349
to review the cables

11:41.350 --> 11:42.884
before you release the next batch?

11:42.885 --> 11:44.586
I knew you had an agenda.

11:44.587 --> 11:46.621
No. Not a chance.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.889
Well, then, I think you need to leave.

11:57.699 --> 11:58.601
Okay.

11:58.602 --> 12:01.269
Viper is more of a
threat than we realized.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.493
He's Top Secret

12:02.494 --> 12:03.499
SCI.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.642
She gave you that?

12:04.643 --> 12:06.374
You Jedi mind-tricked
her, didn't you, ma'am?

12:06.375 --> 12:08.109
There's no time for a victory lap.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.078
This next batch of cables

12:10.079 --> 12:13.547
could blow covert operatives
all over the world.

12:14.734 --> 12:22.853
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

12:28.250 --> 12:29.818
ELIZABETH: <i>Counsel's informed me</i>

12:29.819 --> 12:31.720
that there's no legal recourse

12:31.721 --> 12:33.922
to slow down the impending
document release.

12:33.923 --> 12:35.457
Damn First Amendment.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.791
ELIZABETH: I think we need to get

12:36.792 --> 12:38.460
ahead of this one, Mr. President.

12:38.461 --> 12:39.594
What do you have in mind?

12:39.595 --> 12:41.688
Call in all covert operatives

12:41.689 --> 12:43.064
until we know what we're dealing with.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.032
All?

12:44.033 --> 12:45.800
That's thousands of human assets.

12:45.801 --> 12:47.168
It'd be an unprecedented move.

12:47.169 --> 12:49.070
One that I believe is warranted,

12:49.071 --> 12:50.514
given the downside if I'm right.

12:50.515 --> 12:52.774
All on the word of this reporter?

12:52.775 --> 12:55.992
I mean, ODNI said it's all froth.

12:55.993 --> 12:57.412
You sure she's not playing you?

12:57.413 --> 12:58.713
90% sure.

12:58.714 --> 13:01.149
Based on my profiling of her.

13:01.150 --> 13:05.153
I-I think Fisher purposely
released milder cables first,

13:05.154 --> 13:07.689
in order to create an even bigger story

13:07.690 --> 13:09.257
with the second release.

13:09.258 --> 13:10.458
Journalistic showmanship.

13:10.459 --> 13:11.459
I got a good read

13:11.460 --> 13:12.994
on her, sir.

13:12.995 --> 13:13.995
She's a reporter.

13:13.996 --> 13:15.063
She deals in facts.

13:15.064 --> 13:16.597
I don't believe she'd lie.

13:20.935 --> 13:22.703
I'm going with Elizabeth on this one.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.275
Foreign Minister Dubois is back in Paris

13:27.276 --> 13:29.010
and calling for my dismissal.

13:29.011 --> 13:30.311
I'm not surprised.

13:30.312 --> 13:32.180
You had to pick on a NATO ally,

13:32.181 --> 13:34.382
nuclear power, Security Council member?

13:34.383 --> 13:36.050
Madam Secretary, part of my job

13:36.051 --> 13:38.286
is advising you that you should fire me.

13:38.287 --> 13:40.088
I'm a little busy right now,

13:40.089 --> 13:42.791
and I don't know anyone
else who can do your job.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.192
Don't be too flattered.

13:44.193 --> 13:45.860
I was a CIA analyst for 20 years

13:45.861 --> 13:47.362
and then a college professor,

13:47.363 --> 13:49.731
so I literally don't know anyone else

13:49.732 --> 13:51.065
who can do what you do.

13:51.066 --> 13:53.133
- Oh.
- Look...

13:54.602 --> 13:57.672
I need you to be okay with being
dead-man-walking for a while

13:57.673 --> 13:59.007
until I can find someone else.

13:59.008 --> 14:00.842
I'll draft my resignation letter

14:00.843 --> 14:02.444
and dust off my résumé.

14:02.445 --> 14:04.879
And keep doing my job.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.147
Thank you.

14:10.185 --> 14:11.553
We just ID'd Viper.

14:11.554 --> 14:13.388
He's Jed Heller, former INR analyst.

14:13.389 --> 14:14.589
Left five months ago.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.590
What was his clearance?

14:15.591 --> 14:16.658
Top Secret SCI,

14:16.659 --> 14:18.126
just like Fisher said.

14:18.127 --> 14:19.194
Where is he now?

14:19.195 --> 14:21.095
SIGINT from NSA has him in Guinea.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.565
With whom we don't have
an extradition treaty.

14:23.566 --> 14:25.133
You want me to hold his identity?

14:25.134 --> 14:26.634
No.

14:26.635 --> 14:28.069
You can't give away American secrets

14:28.070 --> 14:29.637
and then sip piña coladas on the beach

14:29.638 --> 14:31.072
while you negotiate your book deal.

14:31.073 --> 14:32.073
Put it out there.

14:32.074 --> 14:33.842
Uh, Madam Secretary...

14:33.843 --> 14:36.611
this Viper guy Heller bolted
on Secretary Marsh's watch,

14:36.612 --> 14:37.946
before you took office.

14:37.947 --> 14:39.147
You want me to play that up?

14:39.148 --> 14:40.248
No.

14:40.249 --> 14:42.550
This is a matter of national security.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.452
I want you to play <i>that</i> up.

14:44.453 --> 14:45.653
(phones ringing)

14:45.654 --> 14:47.587
Oh, let me guess...

14:50.124 --> 14:51.960
Oh, the next document dump just hit.

14:51.961 --> 14:54.329
(phones ringing)

14:54.330 --> 14:57.332
It is as your article suggests:

14:57.333 --> 15:00.602
Religious traditions
breed cultural divisions,

15:00.603 --> 15:03.638
but they can also
dissolve national borders.

15:03.639 --> 15:05.807
Look at the Middle East of today.

15:05.808 --> 15:08.009
I'm impressed, Minister Gorev.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.177
You've obviously read my article

15:09.178 --> 15:10.944
and thought deeply on this subject.

15:11.646 --> 15:13.781
Not as deeply as you, Professor McCord.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.250
Clearly, my daughter

15:15.251 --> 15:16.985
is in good hands.

15:16.986 --> 15:17.986
Excuse me?

15:17.987 --> 15:19.254
Olga.

15:19.255 --> 15:20.488
My youngest.

15:20.489 --> 15:21.656
She is in your Ethics

15:21.657 --> 15:23.691
and Eastern Religions
class at Georgetown.

15:23.692 --> 15:24.859
Oh, I had no idea.

15:24.860 --> 15:26.027
It's a lecture,

15:26.028 --> 15:27.529
so there are a few hundred students.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.130
There is a Saudi prince in there,

15:29.131 --> 15:31.099
but the keffiyeh is a dead giveaway.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.302
Olga is very private girl.

15:34.303 --> 15:36.671
Wants real university experience

15:36.672 --> 15:38.840
without attention because of me.

15:38.841 --> 15:40.575
I get it.

15:40.576 --> 15:41.943
I have a daughter around that age

15:41.944 --> 15:43.111
in a similar circumstance.

15:43.112 --> 15:45.179
So you know what it's like.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.713
Having daughter.

15:47.582 --> 15:49.784
I will look for her. Olga.

15:49.785 --> 15:52.687
That would be nice.

15:52.688 --> 15:55.023
She is having a hard time in this class.

15:55.024 --> 15:56.491
Getting "C"s on her papers.

15:56.492 --> 16:00.995
Well, ethics is a sneakily
deceptive subject.

16:00.996 --> 16:03.064
Especially seen through
the lens of religion.

16:03.065 --> 16:05.066
She wants Harvard for graduate school.

16:05.067 --> 16:08.403
A "C" would kill her GPA.

16:08.404 --> 16:09.771
She needs an "A."

16:09.772 --> 16:13.808
You are aware that it's an ethics class?

16:13.809 --> 16:16.611
And you are aware that I can make life

16:16.612 --> 16:18.112
very difficult for your wife?

16:18.113 --> 16:20.748
It would be shame, given
all her current problems,

16:20.749 --> 16:23.917
if she were to have troubles
in Eastern Europe as well.

16:27.622 --> 16:29.357
MATT: Who knew we spied
on Liechtenstein?

16:29.358 --> 16:31.526
We spy on everybody, dummy,
we just don't advertise it.

16:31.527 --> 16:32.694
They have no standing army,

16:32.695 --> 16:34.729
and their biggest export is false teeth.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.831
They literally have no bite.

16:36.832 --> 16:38.660
Where are we on the
security assessment?

16:38.661 --> 16:40.902
Munsey is on his way to brief you.

16:40.903 --> 16:42.537
Jay is compiling reports from INR

16:42.538 --> 16:44.511
and all the other intelligence services.

16:44.512 --> 16:46.107
I guess that means he still works here.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.442
MATT: Well, we heard about Dubois's

16:47.443 --> 16:49.477
<i>crise DE colère.</i>

16:49.478 --> 16:50.578
That's hissy fit, in French.

16:50.579 --> 16:52.914
I am aware. Just...

16:52.915 --> 16:54.148
let's worry about our own jobs.

16:54.149 --> 16:55.850
Madam Secretary? Director Munsey.

16:55.851 --> 16:56.918
How bad is it?

16:56.919 --> 16:58.453
37 agents blown.

16:58.454 --> 16:59.854
Tell me we got 'em all.

16:59.855 --> 17:01.623
All but one. Roy Schaeffer.

17:01.624 --> 17:02.590
That's his file.

17:02.591 --> 17:04.203
Our top asset in Balochistan.

17:04.204 --> 17:06.327
His cell service was patchy,
so he got word late.

17:06.328 --> 17:07.494
Where is he now?

17:07.496 --> 17:10.163
In a van on his way to
the embassy in Islamabad.

17:10.452 --> 17:12.567
ELIZABETH: His cover is
State Department. USAID.

17:12.568 --> 17:14.636
His real job is keeping
tabs on their nukes.

17:14.637 --> 17:17.069
He'll be executed if he's caught.

17:25.146 --> 17:25.977
Where is he?

17:25.978 --> 17:27.315
GENERAL: Nine blocks from the embassy,

17:27.316 --> 17:28.449
Madam Secretary.

17:28.450 --> 17:30.985
About three quarters of a mile out.

17:30.986 --> 17:32.253
He's going to make it.

17:32.254 --> 17:33.998
MAN: I got eyes on you, Schaeffer.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.813
<i>- Turn left at the next corner.</i>
- That's Colonel Delaney.

17:35.814 --> 17:37.357
He's watching from the embassy roof.

17:37.359 --> 17:39.127
Damn it, I just picked up a Pakistani

17:39.128 --> 17:40.495
military jeep on my tail.

17:40.496 --> 17:41.529
(tires squealing)

17:41.530 --> 17:43.464
DELANY: Open the gate!

17:43.465 --> 17:44.766
We got you, Schaeffer.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.200
Eye on the prize.

17:46.201 --> 17:46.985
SCHAEFFER: Closing on me.

17:46.986 --> 17:48.452
DELANEY: Don't let them in front of you.

17:48.453 --> 17:50.338
<i>- Don't let them cut you off.</i>
- He's got to be

17:50.339 --> 17:52.059
- getting close, right?
- Quarter mile.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.542
DELANY: Schaeffer, you've
got a military vehicle

17:54.543 --> 17:57.177
at nine o'clock, going to cut you off.

17:57.812 --> 17:59.547
He's not gonna make it.

17:59.548 --> 18:01.816
Request permission to leave
the embassy to grab him up.

18:01.817 --> 18:03.484
Denied.

18:03.485 --> 18:05.353
We can't get into a firefight
with the Pakistanis.

18:05.354 --> 18:06.454
Hold your ground.

18:06.455 --> 18:07.822
DELANEY: Schaeffer, you've got

18:07.823 --> 18:10.457
another vehicle at three
o'clock, approaching.

18:12.994 --> 18:14.862
(tires squealing)

18:14.863 --> 18:16.863
There he is.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.439
DELANEY: They got him.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.440
They got him.

18:25.441 --> 18:27.141
We can still engage.

18:27.142 --> 18:28.309
(men speaking Urdu)

18:28.310 --> 18:30.377
No.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.847
No engagement.

18:36.718 --> 18:38.820
Tell my parents and sisters I love 'em.

18:38.821 --> 18:41.221
(men shouting in Urdu)

18:44.892 --> 18:46.594
(truck door shuts)

18:46.595 --> 18:48.563
(engine starts)

18:48.564 --> 18:50.964
(tires squealing)

18:58.852 --> 19:02.062
- Where is he?
- We believe Sahiwal Jail in Lahore.

19:02.063 --> 19:03.363
We're working on confirmation.

19:03.364 --> 19:05.899
Assuming he's there, do we
have any access points?

19:05.900 --> 19:07.300
No one inside.

19:07.301 --> 19:08.604
I have a couple field agents

19:08.605 --> 19:10.286
who've infiltrated the sanitation company

19:10.287 --> 19:11.424
that services the prison.

19:11.425 --> 19:13.239
ELIZABETH: Sahiwal has hundreds of cells

19:13.240 --> 19:14.574
on five floors.

19:14.575 --> 19:17.811
We'd need intel on exactly where he is.

19:17.812 --> 19:20.380
I think we need to take an
exfiltration op off the table.

19:20.381 --> 19:23.316
Can't afford it getting messy.

19:23.317 --> 19:25.418
We could threaten to cut their aid.

19:25.419 --> 19:27.320
Then we might have to cut their aid.

19:27.321 --> 19:28.922
Which would be just as bad.

19:28.923 --> 19:31.491
I can reach out to Ambassador Hesbani,

19:31.492 --> 19:32.959
- offer a public apology.
- For what?

19:32.960 --> 19:34.651
We're not admitting
our guy's in The Company.

19:34.652 --> 19:35.995
For the misunderstanding.

19:35.996 --> 19:37.230
It's a Hail Mary, at best.

19:37.231 --> 19:38.905
The Pakistanis' hands are tied.

19:38.906 --> 19:40.378
They have to manage
unrest in the streets.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.302
We're not exactly winning
any popularity contests

19:42.303 --> 19:43.369
over there.

19:43.370 --> 19:44.870
You have any better ideas?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.174
Give it a shot.

19:50.877 --> 19:52.679
Thanks, everyone.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.148
JACKSON: Elizabeth!

19:55.149 --> 19:56.950
What, I shoot you down
too hard in there?

19:56.951 --> 19:58.518
I can take it.

19:58.519 --> 20:01.454
No, I just wanted to say
sorry about your policy guy.

20:01.455 --> 20:03.156
Yeah, I'm going to hold onto him

20:03.157 --> 20:04.491
until I can find somebody else.

20:04.492 --> 20:05.758
I know a guy.

20:05.759 --> 20:06.759
Really?

20:06.760 --> 20:08.628
Worked for me on House Armed Services.

20:08.629 --> 20:09.963
Just finished a fancy PhD,

20:09.964 --> 20:11.664
he's looking to get back in the game.

20:11.665 --> 20:13.666
I'll send you his résumé.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.568
Thanks.

20:15.569 --> 20:17.437
HENRY: <i>So there I am,</i>

20:17.438 --> 20:19.339
Mano a Mano

20:19.340 --> 20:20.896
with one of the most
powerful men on Earth

20:20.897 --> 20:23.710
and he wants me to
compromise my integrity or else.

20:23.711 --> 20:25.512
Not exactly <i>High Noon,</i> Dad.

20:25.513 --> 20:27.747
Yeah, okay, wise guy. It felt like it.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.015
So what'd you do?

20:29.016 --> 20:30.149
Well, uh...

20:30.150 --> 20:32.085
I have to admit,
I was a little thrown.

20:32.086 --> 20:33.119
But then...

20:33.120 --> 20:34.721
there's no other way to describe it...

20:34.722 --> 20:36.856
this rage built up inside me.

20:36.857 --> 20:38.024
Like the Hulk.

20:38.025 --> 20:39.425
Yeah, kind of.

20:39.426 --> 20:41.094
And then, the next thing I know,

20:41.095 --> 20:42.355
I'm pushing my chair back,

20:42.356 --> 20:44.335
- I stand up and...
- Don't tell me you flipped the table.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.266
No, but I needed to face him down.

20:46.267 --> 20:47.567
And then everything just fell away,

20:47.568 --> 20:49.035
the other people, the food,

20:49.036 --> 20:50.870
the sounds...

20:50.871 --> 20:52.038
I just laser-focused on Gorev,

20:52.039 --> 20:53.640
and I ripped him a new one.

20:53.641 --> 20:55.508
- Go, Dad!
- So gangster!

20:55.509 --> 20:56.776
How big of a new one?

20:56.777 --> 20:58.678
(laughing) Uh... pretty big new one.

20:58.679 --> 21:00.780
- (all laughing)
- I told him

21:00.781 --> 21:03.006
that I would not compromise my ethics

21:03.007 --> 21:04.250
and that his daughter had to live

21:04.251 --> 21:05.518
with whatever grade she earned.

21:05.519 --> 21:06.753
Oh, and then I told him,

21:06.754 --> 21:09.455
that "My wife can handle herself, pal.

21:09.456 --> 21:10.890
And you better not underestimate her."

21:10.891 --> 21:11.958
- Ooh...
- STEVIE: All right.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.759
- That's sweet.
- Go, Mom.

21:14.827 --> 21:17.664
Well, Ali's still suffering in silence.

21:17.665 --> 21:19.499
Ah, the poor thing.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.134
I could barely get a smile out of her.

21:21.135 --> 21:23.770
If we didn't know, I'd
ask her, "What's wrong?

21:23.771 --> 21:25.305
Why you being so quiet?"

21:25.306 --> 21:26.439
So ask.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.641
I'm afraid she'll make me.

21:28.642 --> 21:29.976
You're ex-CIA.

21:29.977 --> 21:31.244
She won't.

21:31.245 --> 21:32.912
Well, I'd feel even more guilty

21:32.913 --> 21:34.280
using those skills on her.

21:34.281 --> 21:37.350
Whatever happened to
"We spy because we love?"

21:37.351 --> 21:39.818
I don't... I don't know.

21:40.420 --> 21:41.988
You okay?

21:41.989 --> 21:44.290
Yeah.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.326
No.

21:46.327 --> 21:48.328
Work is tough.

21:48.329 --> 21:50.697
And I have to be able to turn it off

21:50.698 --> 21:52.165
before I come back here.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.833
You were very present
with the kids before.

21:53.834 --> 21:57.837
And now I want to be present with you.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.239
Hey.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.941
I hope I didn't really make things

22:01.942 --> 22:03.776
difficult for you with Gorev.

22:03.777 --> 22:07.046
No, I like that you stood up to him.

22:07.047 --> 22:08.414
It's sexy.

22:08.415 --> 22:09.716
Is it?

22:09.717 --> 22:11.150
Yeah.

22:11.151 --> 22:14.487
Your ethics are... even sexier.

22:14.488 --> 22:15.688
Really?

22:15.689 --> 22:17.357
Mmm.

22:17.358 --> 22:21.327
Man with a solid moral compass?

22:21.328 --> 22:22.762
Big turn on.

22:22.763 --> 22:26.498
Who says you have to be
a bad boy to get the hot girl?

22:31.471 --> 22:33.939
(men talking indistinctly in distance)

22:42.281 --> 22:45.250
All right, there's obviously
been some kind of mistake.

22:49.589 --> 22:51.656
What is your job for the CIA?

22:52.859 --> 22:55.361
I'm not CIA, dude.

22:55.362 --> 22:58.364
I'm with the USAID Safe
Drinking Water Project.

22:58.365 --> 23:00.099
I'm doing you guys a solid.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.069
The cable says you are
a CIA operative in Balochistan.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.971
Cable got it wrong.

23:04.972 --> 23:07.440
Ask me about the effectiveness
of decontaminating crystals

23:07.441 --> 23:09.542
in preventing the spread of cholera.

23:09.543 --> 23:11.711
Then why were you in such
a hurry to get to your embassy?

23:11.712 --> 23:13.146
I was just running late on a buddy, man.

23:13.147 --> 23:15.947
Come on, I'm an American aide worker.

23:17.150 --> 23:20.019
I'm an American aide work...

23:20.020 --> 23:21.988
Hey. Hey! Hey! Wait!

23:21.989 --> 23:23.189
Wait, wait! No, n-n-no!

23:23.190 --> 23:26.691
(screaming)

23:27.560 --> 23:31.130
This balushahi is not quite
as good as my mother's.

23:31.131 --> 23:33.533
(laughs) But close.

23:33.534 --> 23:35.601
Well, you'll have to give our pastry chef

23:35.602 --> 23:36.969
your mother's recipe.

23:36.970 --> 23:38.805
Family secret.

23:38.806 --> 23:40.972
You'll have to beat it out of her.

23:43.409 --> 23:46.679
I appreciate you making time
for me, Ambassador Hesbani.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.148
My pleasure, Madam Secretary.

23:49.149 --> 23:51.184
I speak for the president when I say

23:51.185 --> 23:53.653
we'd like to find a solution
to our current situation

23:53.654 --> 23:56.756
as quickly and as amicably as possible.

23:56.757 --> 23:58.324
Of course.

23:58.325 --> 23:59.425
But what can be done?

23:59.426 --> 24:02.061
An apology.

24:02.062 --> 24:03.262
From me.

24:03.263 --> 24:04.330
In public.

24:04.331 --> 24:06.699
As you're of course aware,

24:06.700 --> 24:09.936
public prostration by
any American official

24:09.937 --> 24:13.005
at my level is... it's almost unheard of.

24:13.006 --> 24:17.110
But this is how much we value
our relationship with Pakistan.

24:17.111 --> 24:18.945
Generous offer.

24:18.946 --> 24:22.081
But I-I'm afraid my
government's hands are tied.

24:22.082 --> 24:24.383
After Bin Laden, all the drone strikes.

24:24.384 --> 24:27.253
We can't appear to be appeasing America.

24:27.254 --> 24:28.755
Our people simply won't accept it.

24:28.756 --> 24:30.790
I understand.

24:30.791 --> 24:33.525
But can I ask that you bring
this to President Masood?

24:34.093 --> 24:35.827
Thank you.

24:36.929 --> 24:40.399
I'm also asking for humane
treatment and time.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.602
If you could hold off on a trial.

24:42.603 --> 24:45.738
We treat all our prisoners humanely.

24:45.739 --> 24:47.840
But I will make a special inquiry.

24:47.841 --> 24:51.376
As for a trial, it has already
been scheduled for next week.

24:53.179 --> 24:56.015
I see your intelligence services

24:56.016 --> 24:58.650
haven't penetrated our legal system.

24:59.919 --> 25:01.953
Can you postpone the trial?

25:03.489 --> 25:06.058
Madam Secretary,

25:06.059 --> 25:09.295
your country has shown it can
disrespect our sovereignty

25:09.296 --> 25:10.963
with impunity.

25:10.964 --> 25:12.865
The prerogative of the greater power.

25:12.866 --> 25:18.503
But when you are caught, you
must accept the consequences.

25:20.940 --> 25:22.341
Madam Secretary, Schaeffer's capture

25:22.342 --> 25:23.509
by the Pakistanis hit the wires.

25:23.510 --> 25:25.148
It's wall-to-wall on the cable outlets.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.781
Everyone needs to stop
ambushing me on my way in.

25:28.782 --> 25:30.550
We thought you'd want
to know right away.

25:30.551 --> 25:33.219
Well, might need to
redefine "right away."

25:33.220 --> 25:34.854
So, how do you want to spin it?

25:34.855 --> 25:36.088
Schaeffer? I don't.

25:36.089 --> 25:37.423
So, we're going with,

25:37.424 --> 25:40.526
"Yeah, he was spying on
their nukes, our bad"?

25:40.527 --> 25:43.696
We expect Pakistan
to treat all prisoners,

25:43.697 --> 25:45.198
including U.S. citizens,

25:45.199 --> 25:46.599
humanely and in accordance

25:46.600 --> 25:48.301
with the third and fourth
Geneva Convention.

25:48.302 --> 25:51.036
- Got it.
- Copy that.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.706
You have a visitor, Madam Secretary.

25:53.707 --> 25:55.074
God, where did you come from?

25:55.075 --> 25:56.608
I'm always with you.

25:57.243 --> 25:58.845
All right, who's visiting?

25:58.846 --> 26:00.012
And why are we allowing it?

26:00.013 --> 26:01.547
Our favorite reporter, Gina Fisher.

26:01.548 --> 26:02.682
Says it's urgent.

26:02.683 --> 26:04.150
Really?

26:04.151 --> 26:06.686
Put her in conference East
and don't offer her a beverage.

26:06.687 --> 26:08.688
Oh. Also, Russell
Jackson's office asked me

26:08.689 --> 26:10.823
to put this résumé in your hands.

26:10.824 --> 26:12.158
Is it any good?

26:12.159 --> 26:13.395
Rhodes scholar, Peace Corps,

26:13.396 --> 26:15.027
PhD in International
Studies from Yale.

26:15.028 --> 26:16.529
Well, if you like that kind of thing.

26:16.530 --> 26:17.763
There are 200 more of them.

26:17.764 --> 26:19.031
They've been pouring in all day.

26:19.032 --> 26:21.699
Have Nadine go through them.

26:25.238 --> 26:27.540
Ms. Fisher.

26:27.541 --> 26:29.408
Jed Heller is sick.

26:29.409 --> 26:31.377
He's not going by Viper anymore?

26:31.378 --> 26:33.446
He didn't get immunizations
before going to Guinea,

26:33.447 --> 26:36.849
and the medical care there isn't great.

26:36.850 --> 26:40.351
He can't stop vomiting
and he wants to come home.

26:41.153 --> 26:42.221
He's welcome to come back

26:42.222 --> 26:44.190
and stand trial for
espionage anytime he wants.

26:44.191 --> 26:46.158
Tell that to Guinea.

26:46.159 --> 26:47.760
Because your office leaked his identity,

26:47.761 --> 26:48.995
now they don't want to let him go.

26:48.996 --> 26:50.563
They think he's too valuable.

26:50.564 --> 26:52.031
Did you just call <i>me</i> a leaker?

26:52.032 --> 26:54.200
He's an American citizen.
You have to do something.

26:54.201 --> 26:56.402
I don't need you to lecture
me on civic responsibility.

26:56.403 --> 26:57.970
Fine.

26:57.971 --> 27:00.038
But if he dies, it's on you.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.001
Madam Secretary.

27:15.002 --> 27:17.537
We've confirmed with the
Guinea health ministry

27:17.538 --> 27:19.305
that Mr. Heller has been admitted

27:19.306 --> 27:21.707
to the Ignace Deen Hospital in Conakry.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.975
How bad is he?

27:22.976 --> 27:26.012
He has, uh, schistosomiasis.

27:26.013 --> 27:28.214
It's a rare African disease

27:28.215 --> 27:31.284
caused by an... infestation of worms

27:31.285 --> 27:32.685
in the skin.

27:32.686 --> 27:34.821
A worm disease.

27:34.822 --> 27:36.489
Fitting.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.292
He's also developed a
secondary meningococcus.

27:39.293 --> 27:43.029
CDC says he needs a
regimen of ceftriaxone,

27:43.030 --> 27:45.698
which isn't available in
Guinea, or he could die.

27:45.699 --> 27:48.501
And I was starting to think
maybe we didn't want him back.

27:48.502 --> 27:51.971
A trial would put this whole
mess back in the news.

27:51.972 --> 27:54.640
True, but there's justice
to consider, ma'am.

27:54.641 --> 27:56.075
Well, yeah, there's that.

27:56.076 --> 27:58.444
And he is an American citizen,

27:58.445 --> 28:00.046
deserving of our protection,

28:00.047 --> 28:02.381
regardless of what he's done.

28:02.382 --> 28:04.383
That, too.

28:04.384 --> 28:09.122
Have our Guinea ambassador reach
out on humanitarian grounds.

28:09.123 --> 28:10.523
Any inducements?

28:10.524 --> 28:12.924
No, the inducement is I'm asking.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.661
Nadine, did you get a chance

28:15.662 --> 28:18.931
to read that résumé from Jackson?

28:18.932 --> 28:21.033
Yes. Ben Rosenthal.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.202
He's more than qualified.

28:23.203 --> 28:24.637
So, should I meet with him?

28:24.638 --> 28:26.172
Or will I have to worry

28:26.173 --> 28:29.174
that he's always gonna be Jackson's guy?

28:30.209 --> 28:34.079
Everyone is someone else's
guy, until they're your guy.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.418
The Islamabad court just
sentenced Roy Schaeffer to death.

28:39.419 --> 28:41.721
What?

28:41.722 --> 28:44.689
Hesbani told me the trial
wasn't until next week.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.525
Pakistan.

28:48.461 --> 28:51.330
ELIZABETH: He's scheduled
to be hanged in two days.

28:51.331 --> 28:52.365
JACKSON: That's fast.

28:52.366 --> 28:54.133
Even for that part of the world.

28:54.134 --> 28:55.935
Well, they're making a point.

28:55.936 --> 28:58.203
I'm open to ideas.

28:59.372 --> 29:01.274
Maybe that op that Munsey
was talking about.

29:01.275 --> 29:02.742
That you were against?

29:02.743 --> 29:04.944
Well, that was before
the execution was set.

29:04.945 --> 29:07.413
And we've confirmed
that he's at Sahiwal.

29:07.414 --> 29:09.482
We've penetrated
their sanitation system.

29:09.483 --> 29:10.917
Maybe we can turn a prison guard?

29:10.918 --> 29:13.986
Well, then we'd have to get
him out, and his family, too.

29:13.987 --> 29:15.454
I can have Munsey get into that.

29:15.455 --> 29:16.889
The Secretary of State's job is

29:16.890 --> 29:20.426
to offer diplomatic solutions,
not cowboy operations.

29:20.427 --> 29:22.328
Oh, I resent that characterization,

29:22.329 --> 29:24.564
especially coming from someone
who's never even run an op.

29:24.565 --> 29:28.367
Bess, it has to be
a diplomatic solution.

29:28.368 --> 29:30.469
What if there isn't one?

29:30.470 --> 29:32.790
Then what's our response
after they execute Schaeffer?

29:34.774 --> 29:39.344
We're disappointed, but Pakistan
is still an important ally.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.947
Let's keep thinking on it.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.655
Prisoner swap?

29:49.656 --> 29:51.090
Who do we got?

29:51.091 --> 29:53.859
Five Pakistani nationals at Guantanamo

29:53.860 --> 29:55.294
on various terrorism charges.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.495
Do the Pakistanis want 'em?

29:56.496 --> 29:57.663
Families do.

29:57.664 --> 29:59.498
- Have made inquiries.
- (cell phone beeps)

29:59.499 --> 30:01.867
The Guineans are refusing
to hand over Jed Heller.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.903
His health is declining.

30:03.904 --> 30:05.972
He's been moved to intensive care.

30:05.973 --> 30:09.275
Let's stay focused on the guy
who didn't betray his country.

30:09.276 --> 30:13.212
I want an answer on what will
move Pakistan on Schaeffer.

30:13.213 --> 30:14.714
You want an answer?

30:14.715 --> 30:16.215
An SC-RAM defensive system.

30:16.216 --> 30:18.484
(snickers) That is not an answer, dude.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.519
She asked what would
move the Pakistanis.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.655
- What, you're telling me it won't?
- Of course it would,

30:22.656 --> 30:24.423
but we <i>can't</i> give one to the Pakistanis.

30:24.424 --> 30:26.359
What are you talking about?

30:26.360 --> 30:28.427
Strategic Counter Rocket,
Artillery and Mortar system,

30:28.428 --> 30:30.296
also known as Steel Cage.

30:30.297 --> 30:32.198
It's a high-tech defensive weapons system

30:32.199 --> 30:33.866
that we deployed two years ago.

30:33.867 --> 30:35.935
The Pakistanis practically
begged us for it.

30:35.936 --> 30:37.436
Why?

30:37.437 --> 30:38.971
Because India has it.

30:38.972 --> 30:41.140
The Pakistanis made their case

30:41.141 --> 30:42.975
for military rebalancing

30:42.976 --> 30:45.745
and improving strategic
status quo here at State,

30:45.746 --> 30:47.913
at Defense and at the White House...

30:47.914 --> 30:49.248
Dalton killed it.

30:49.249 --> 30:51.884
And if we give it to them now...

30:51.885 --> 30:55.755
Too arms for hostagey.

30:55.756 --> 30:58.324
Does anyone else have
it other than India?

30:58.325 --> 31:00.960
The Chinese and the Russians
each have their own versions.

31:00.961 --> 31:03.394
But neither are interested
in selling it to Pakistan.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.567
ELIZABETH: <i>I worked the phones for hours</i>

31:08.568 --> 31:11.671
and finally got everybody
on board with a deal

31:11.672 --> 31:15.274
that the president and
Pakistan signed off on.

31:15.275 --> 31:16.909
Wow. Congrats. You're amazing.

31:16.910 --> 31:18.878
Well, Jay, my policy guy, provided

31:18.879 --> 31:20.112
a huge piece of the puzzle,

31:20.113 --> 31:23.182
but <i>I</i> pulled the rabbit out of a hat.

31:23.183 --> 31:26.451
I told you you'd be great at this job.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.387
Thanks.

31:28.388 --> 31:32.425
But aren't you curious
about what the rabbit is?

31:32.426 --> 31:33.826
Your big idea? Of course.

31:33.827 --> 31:35.728
I'm just so used to not asking

31:35.729 --> 31:37.697
'cause I assume it's confidential.

31:37.698 --> 31:38.831
It is.

31:38.832 --> 31:41.534
But not for you.

31:41.535 --> 31:43.169
Why is that?

31:43.170 --> 31:44.937
It's a three way deal.

31:44.938 --> 31:48.474
And it actually has
Russia giving Pakistan

31:48.475 --> 31:50.843
something that they really want.

31:50.844 --> 31:52.278
Secretly, of course.

31:52.279 --> 31:55.281
Okay, so why am I privy?

31:55.282 --> 31:59.385
Because we need to give Russia
something that they want.

31:59.386 --> 32:00.720
Something really special.

32:00.721 --> 32:02.621
What?

32:02.622 --> 32:04.289
An "A."

32:04.405 --> 32:07.156
I floated to Foreign Minister Gorev

32:07.157 --> 32:09.141
that you would give his daughter an "A"

32:09.229 --> 32:10.812
if he would convince his government

32:10.813 --> 32:14.400
to sell Pakistan a certain
defensive weapons system.

32:14.401 --> 32:17.516
I was totally skeptical
that he would go for it,

32:17.517 --> 32:19.427
but then, I mean, you know how important

32:19.428 --> 32:21.239
his daughter's grade is to him.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.578
I know! It's crazy.

32:25.579 --> 32:27.413
Nuts!

32:27.414 --> 32:28.547
Arms for A's.

32:28.548 --> 32:30.449
Please tell me you're kidding.

32:30.450 --> 32:34.153
No, not kidding, babe.

32:34.154 --> 32:36.622
Gorev's office is holding
on my secure line right now,

32:36.623 --> 32:38.321
waiting final word that you'll do it

32:38.322 --> 32:40.760
before shipping the weapons
system to Pakistan.

32:40.761 --> 32:42.495
Gorev can deliver a weapons system?

32:42.496 --> 32:44.291
Second most powerful guy in Russia.

32:44.292 --> 32:46.265
And you actually put me
in the middle of all this?

32:46.266 --> 32:48.299
Rabbit out of the hat.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.235
How dare you.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.939
Henry.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.275
I know, I was desperate.

32:56.276 --> 32:57.171
If this got out,

32:57.172 --> 32:59.178
my entire life's work
would be discredited.

32:59.179 --> 33:00.041
I would be ruined.

33:00.042 --> 33:01.580
Well, that's why it's top secret.

33:01.581 --> 33:05.117
I feel really good about that
after your whole Viper mess.

33:05.118 --> 33:07.386
Well, now, technically,
that was Marsh's mess.

33:07.387 --> 33:09.755
What happened to my ethics
being so sexy to you?

33:09.756 --> 33:12.124
They are! This is a one-off!

33:12.125 --> 33:14.093
It's just a crazy situation
that trumps ethics.

33:14.094 --> 33:16.662
The very nature of ethics
is they can't be trumped.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.798
Please don't make me argue
with a religion professor.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.415
So, your work is more
important than mine?

33:20.416 --> 33:21.567
Of course not.

33:21.568 --> 33:23.369
But you're willing
to risk my entire career.

33:23.370 --> 33:24.870
A man is going to be killed.

33:24.871 --> 33:25.838
Who's gonna get killed?

33:25.839 --> 33:27.339
No one.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.340
Then why'd you say it?

33:28.341 --> 33:30.376
Go back to bed, please? Come on.

33:30.377 --> 33:31.644
Josh broke up with me.

33:31.645 --> 33:34.447
- At 2:00 in the morning?
- Oh, my God.

33:34.448 --> 33:36.015
- Aw, Noodle.
- He's a doofus anyway.

33:36.016 --> 33:37.183
- Hey, Jason!
- Shut up.

33:37.184 --> 33:38.250
ELIZABETH: Alison, listen.

33:38.251 --> 33:39.585
Your dad and I just have something

33:39.586 --> 33:41.220
really important that we
need to talk about, okay?

33:41.221 --> 33:42.621
More important than my
shattered existence?

33:42.622 --> 33:44.623
- No.
- Henry...

33:44.624 --> 33:47.135
Okay, look, Noodle, I'll be
there in a minute, okay?

33:47.136 --> 33:48.283
Do you know the guy getting killed?

33:48.284 --> 33:49.230
Back to bed!

33:49.231 --> 33:50.729
- Upstairs!
- Yeah, whatever you say,

33:50.730 --> 33:52.698
- <i>mein</i> Secretary.
- Come on, dude.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.132
Thank you.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.070
Henry?

33:58.071 --> 33:59.905
Henry...

33:59.906 --> 34:03.542
this is important.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.678
So is my integrity.

34:05.679 --> 34:07.813
As an academic, that's all I have.

34:07.814 --> 34:09.047
Oh, come on!

34:09.049 --> 34:12.918
I compromise my ethics every
single day in this job!

34:12.918 --> 34:15.286
That's not entirely true.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.192
I don't have time to worry

34:20.193 --> 34:22.061
about my decaying moral fiber.

34:22.062 --> 34:24.463
I moved heaven and Earth to get

34:24.464 --> 34:26.331
the president and Pakistan and Russia

34:26.333 --> 34:30.168
all on board, and the entire
thing falls apart without you.

34:30.170 --> 34:33.071
So, please, just say yes.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.542
No.

34:36.543 --> 34:38.310
You shouldn't have involved me in this.

34:38.311 --> 34:40.110
You're gonna have to find another way.

34:42.815 --> 34:46.184
Now, I'm gonna go and
comfort our daughter.

35:00.073 --> 35:01.207
How's Ali?

35:01.208 --> 35:03.142
Extremely upset.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.577
Understandably.

35:04.578 --> 35:06.012
Yeah.

35:06.013 --> 35:07.847
I'm gonna check on her later.

35:07.848 --> 35:10.783
I've been on the phone
with Gorev, and...

35:10.784 --> 35:13.753
I got him to move off the "A."

35:13.754 --> 35:16.589
Oh, my God. Now we're gonna
be fighting over a "B"?

35:16.590 --> 35:18.124
No.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.694
All Gorev cares about
is his daughter's GPA.

35:21.695 --> 35:24.263
If you would consider
giving her an incomplete,

35:24.264 --> 35:25.865
that wouldn't affect it.

35:25.866 --> 35:28.034
She can retake the course next semester

35:28.035 --> 35:31.002
and you don't give an undeserved grade.

35:31.871 --> 35:34.439
The deadline for incompletes has passed.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.310
Henry, I'm out of rabbits.

35:40.713 --> 35:43.583
This operative will really die

35:43.584 --> 35:44.717
if you don't make this deal?

35:44.718 --> 35:45.885
Yes.

35:45.886 --> 35:48.254
Does he have family?

35:48.255 --> 35:51.457
A mom, a dad and three little sisters.

35:51.458 --> 35:55.094
That you didn't shove in my
face before to try to move me?

35:55.095 --> 35:58.363
Well, even Elizabeth the
Unethical has her lines.

36:02.735 --> 36:04.669
Okay.

36:15.114 --> 36:17.349
(softly): Thank you.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.802
<i>The United States</i>

36:35.803 --> 36:37.370
is very sorry

36:37.371 --> 36:38.805
for the misunderstanding

36:38.806 --> 36:41.140
between our two countries.

36:41.141 --> 36:42.275
Pakistan

36:42.276 --> 36:43.776
is an important ally

36:43.777 --> 36:46.244
and friend.

36:47.780 --> 36:48.881
Where are we?

36:48.882 --> 36:50.750
It's the live image of the embassy gate

36:50.751 --> 36:53.084
in Islamabad. No sign of them yet.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.722
They were supposed to deliver
Schaeffer half hour ago.

36:56.723 --> 36:58.490
They could be backing out.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.100
Call Hesbani.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.668
I want him in my office.

37:11.471 --> 37:13.238
What's that?

37:39.832 --> 37:43.702
That's him. That's Schaeffer.

37:58.451 --> 38:00.652
(mouthing)

38:05.892 --> 38:08.361
NADINE: Madam Secretary, protocol

38:08.362 --> 38:10.863
explicitly states that
foreign gifts remain

38:10.864 --> 38:12.899
- in the gift room.
- Noted.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.535
I decree an exception.

38:15.536 --> 38:17.503
Oh, thank God.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.072
- (whoops)
- (laughs)

38:20.073 --> 38:21.707
I second the decree.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.442
DAISY: Uh, uh, decrees
don't need seconding.

38:23.443 --> 38:25.177
Uh, this one felt like it did.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.414
Let's have a toast to Roy Schaeffer.

38:28.415 --> 38:29.749
Welcome home.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.250
ALL: Welcome home!

38:36.188 --> 38:37.423
Smooth.

38:37.424 --> 38:39.926
I don't know what
Jefferson's problem was.

38:39.927 --> 38:41.761
Now that Schaeffer's back,

38:41.762 --> 38:43.496
can you tell us how you got the Russians

38:43.497 --> 38:45.331
to move on giving an SC-RAM

38:45.332 --> 38:47.066
to the Pakistanis?

38:47.067 --> 38:48.701
Guess I was just convincing.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.603
Guinea handed Jed Heller

38:50.604 --> 38:52.772
over to the U.S. consulate in Conakry.

38:52.773 --> 38:55.341
He's on a medical plane
heading to Ramstein.

38:55.342 --> 38:57.176
That's a quick change
of heart for the Guineans.

38:57.177 --> 38:58.377
The Russians hold

38:58.378 --> 39:00.780
a lot of sway over them.
They put in a word.

39:00.781 --> 39:03.616
The Russians must've really
wanted whatever you gave them.

39:03.617 --> 39:05.851
The good news is

39:05.852 --> 39:07.620
Heller's gonna face the music.

39:07.621 --> 39:09.188
After he's de-wormed.

39:09.189 --> 39:10.823
(all groan)

39:10.824 --> 39:12.992
You know, speaking of Heller,

39:12.993 --> 39:15.795
I want to make an actual decree.

39:15.796 --> 39:17.363
Matt, draft a memo to the staff.

39:17.364 --> 39:19.699
From now on,

39:19.700 --> 39:22.034
I expect all correspondence

39:22.035 --> 39:25.204
at every level of confidentiality

39:25.205 --> 39:28.274
to be civil and respectful,

39:28.275 --> 39:31.043
worthy of the office being represented.

39:31.044 --> 39:32.378
How wide do you want it to go?

39:32.379 --> 39:33.846
How many people work here?

39:33.847 --> 39:35.948
31,822.

39:35.949 --> 39:36.983
That'll do it.

39:36.984 --> 39:38.985
Now take your cocktails

39:38.986 --> 39:40.686
and the rest of the day to yourselves.

39:40.687 --> 39:41.721
Thank you.

39:41.722 --> 39:42.989
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:42.990 --> 39:45.057
Madam Secretary, can I have a minute?

39:45.058 --> 39:47.026
Ah, sure.

39:47.027 --> 39:50.730
Now that, uh, things have settled down.

39:50.731 --> 39:53.566
Well, unless that's great
seats to the Kennedy Center,

39:53.567 --> 39:55.267
I don't want it.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.136
What about Dubois?

39:57.137 --> 39:58.537
I called him this morning

39:58.538 --> 40:00.539
and told him that while I was very sorry

40:00.540 --> 40:01.874
that he was insulted,

40:01.875 --> 40:05.444
he doesn't get to make
decisions about my staff.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.912
How'd he take it?

40:06.913 --> 40:09.215
I had to pardon his French.

40:09.216 --> 40:11.083
(laughs softly)

40:11.084 --> 40:12.952
What about Jackson's guy?

40:12.953 --> 40:16.389
Your idea helped to save a man's life.

40:16.390 --> 40:18.090
You got it over the finish line.

40:18.091 --> 40:20.493
So... we're a good team.

40:20.494 --> 40:23.029
All due respect,

40:23.030 --> 40:24.730
I was on Secretary Marsh's team.

40:24.731 --> 40:25.798
I was his guy.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.133
I know.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.235
I was hoping to ride him
to the White House.

40:29.236 --> 40:32.438
You don't have such ambitions.

40:32.439 --> 40:33.973
You're right.

40:33.974 --> 40:37.543
But clearly you can make
a difference here at State.

40:37.544 --> 40:41.580
And I am a sucker for anyone
who's good at their job.

40:41.581 --> 40:42.882
But if something comes along

40:42.883 --> 40:44.717
with a presidential contender,

40:44.718 --> 40:45.918
I'll understand.

40:45.919 --> 40:48.319
Okay.

40:50.122 --> 40:53.025
Oh, and, uh, Jay, one other thing.

40:53.026 --> 40:57.028
As long as you're here,
you're my guy now.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.676
HENRY: <i>Stevie got home
a little while ago.</i>

41:10.677 --> 41:14.113
Seems like she had an pretty
good first night hostessing.

41:14.114 --> 41:15.181
If humbling.

41:15.182 --> 41:16.882
Cool.

41:16.883 --> 41:20.386
Did you notice that Ali's
in much better spirits?

41:20.387 --> 41:21.887
Oh, I noticed.

41:21.888 --> 41:23.488
Check this out.

41:24.323 --> 41:25.591
What?

41:25.592 --> 41:29.028
Fresh intel on Ali's better spirits.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.963
Flint Summers.

41:30.964 --> 41:32.631
Who's that?

41:32.632 --> 41:34.200
They've been texting all afternoon.

41:34.201 --> 41:36.102
Clearly she's moved on from Josh.

41:36.103 --> 41:37.403
So I did a little digging.

41:37.404 --> 41:40.372
He plays on the varsity football team.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.441
Flint is two years ahead of Ali.

41:42.442 --> 41:43.709
That makes him 17.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.678
I know. Whole new world from 15.

41:45.679 --> 41:48.047
Yeah, and by whole new world,
you mean... he'll... sex.

41:48.048 --> 41:49.582
- He'll push for it.
- Of course!

41:49.583 --> 41:51.917
Name like Flint Summers?
There's no boundaries.

41:51.918 --> 41:54.285
(stammers)

41:55.054 --> 41:56.455
What are we doing?

41:56.456 --> 41:57.656
Losing our minds.

41:57.657 --> 41:58.691
Pretty much.

41:58.692 --> 42:01.726
We have to stop this, don't we?

42:06.632 --> 42:09.602
Okay, if I push this button...

42:09.603 --> 42:12.338
we sever the link forever.

42:12.339 --> 42:15.508
Yeah.

42:15.509 --> 42:17.909
(tablet dings)

42:19.612 --> 42:21.213
Now, it begins.

42:21.214 --> 42:23.581
Parenting without a net.

42:25.384 --> 42:27.286
Well, Stevie turned out all right.

42:27.287 --> 42:28.454
She quit college.

42:28.455 --> 42:29.588
She's not a meth addict.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.089
That's a high bar.

42:32.691 --> 42:34.960
Listen, about last night?

42:34.961 --> 42:36.762
Oh, I'm over it.

42:36.763 --> 42:39.765
I saw the video of Schaeffer
reuniting with his family.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.468
Well, good. I wasn't
apologizing about that.

42:42.469 --> 42:43.969
It's this job.

42:43.970 --> 42:47.439
Is it turning me into a morally
compromised version of myself?

42:47.440 --> 42:50.676
Because I am worried
that I'm gonna become

42:50.677 --> 42:52.511
someone that you can't
be with anymore.

42:52.512 --> 42:54.113
Whoa, whoa.

42:54.114 --> 42:57.349
I talk a good game, but I
am no pillar of virtue.

42:57.350 --> 42:59.585
You're a good man.

42:59.586 --> 43:01.587
I-I need you to be my touchstone.

43:01.588 --> 43:04.924
Uh, to tell me if I'm crossing lines.

43:04.925 --> 43:08.260
I'd quit this job in a heartbeat
if it threatened what we have.

43:08.261 --> 43:11.263
Hey.

43:11.264 --> 43:14.967
That's not gonna happen.

43:14.968 --> 43:17.870
But if you're asking me

43:17.871 --> 43:20.005
to be the man beside the woman?

43:20.006 --> 43:22.074
I'm in.

43:22.075 --> 43:24.743
"The man beside the woman."

43:24.744 --> 43:26.477
Yeah.
