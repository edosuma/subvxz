WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.079
Previously on...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.116
I'm gonna die,
and I'd like to know

00:04.140 --> 00:06.183
what happened to my daughter
before I do.

00:06.207 --> 00:09.077
When it comes to Wisteria Lane,
there are old crimes...

00:12.213 --> 00:14.321
New crimes...

00:14.345 --> 00:17.164
As soon as it gets dark,
we get rid of that body.

00:17.188 --> 00:20.188
And crimes that are happening...

00:21.292 --> 00:25.072
Right under everyone's nose.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.396
I'm thinking
it's the applewhites.

00:30.061 --> 00:32.008
Jim halverson was aware

00:32.031 --> 00:34.089
that he had little
to offer a woman.

00:34.113 --> 00:37.344
He was neither rich,
nor smart, nor handsome.

00:37.368 --> 00:39.316
Are you Jim? I'm Susan Mayer.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.288
Oh.

00:41.312 --> 00:43.290
So when his friend set him up
on a blind date

00:43.314 --> 00:45.127
with a beautiful stranger...

00:45.151 --> 00:47.354
Wow, you're so much hotter
than Nikki said you'd be.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.156
How old are you?

00:49.180 --> 00:51.298
How old do you think I am?

00:51.322 --> 00:54.409
Jim made the tragic decision
to try to be funny.

00:54.433 --> 00:57.304
Not a day over 50.

00:57.328 --> 01:00.067
Why don't we get our table?

01:00.091 --> 01:01.268
Well, no, see, that was funny,

01:01.292 --> 01:03.270
because you're
so obviously not 50.

01:03.294 --> 01:05.281
That's why I said 50,
'cause it's absurd.

01:05.305 --> 01:09.346
Jim did everything he could
to get Susan Mayer to laugh.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.178
He tried racial humor...

01:11.202 --> 01:15.051
So guess what time Chinese
people go to the dentist?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.223
2:30.

01:18.149 --> 01:20.327
Uh, get it? "Tooth-hurty?"

01:20.351 --> 01:22.058
Tooth-hurty.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.430
I love that.

01:23.454 --> 01:26.193
He tried to be
engagingly risquÃ©...

01:26.217 --> 01:28.287
Rectum? Damn near killed him!

01:30.191 --> 01:33.240
Uh, you know what
a rectum is, right?

01:36.197 --> 01:39.146
He even tried gentle teasing.

01:39.170 --> 01:42.279
No, no, you see,
by comparing you to a Nazi,

01:42.303 --> 01:45.290
I was making the point
that you're so not a Nazi.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.083
You're like the...

01:47.107 --> 01:48.415
And just when Jim thought

01:48.439 --> 01:50.417
the date couldn't
get any worse...

01:50.441 --> 01:52.219
Oh! Oh!

01:52.243 --> 01:54.090
Ow! Oh.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.163
It did.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.225
Okay, Jim,
I need you to look up...

01:58.249 --> 02:00.397
And down.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.399
All right, so,
how did this happen?

02:02.423 --> 02:04.201
It was an accident.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.203
Oh, I don't know about that.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.435
In some cultures
head-butting is a mating ritual.

02:08.459 --> 02:10.176
Yeah.

02:10.201 --> 02:13.210
Dr. Mccready, can I
talk to you about my head?

02:13.234 --> 02:16.383
Away from... The draft?

02:16.407 --> 02:19.386
Yeah, you can call me
Dr. Ron. Everyone does.

02:19.410 --> 02:21.348
Uh, Dr. Ron...

02:21.372 --> 02:23.350
I need you to pretend
there's something wrong with me

02:23.374 --> 02:26.223
and admit me for the night.
I'm sorry?

02:26.247 --> 02:29.296
This is the worst date
I have ever been on in my life.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.228
That man is the most obnoxious,
offensive, annoying human being.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.160
And you're looking at me
like I'm crazy right now,

02:33.184 --> 02:34.511
but I will be if I spend
one more second with him.

02:34.535 --> 02:36.403
So you gotta help me.
You gotta do something.

02:36.427 --> 02:38.405
It's my mental health.
My mental health!

02:38.429 --> 02:40.267
You took an oath.

02:40.291 --> 02:43.210
Could you let go
of my lapel, please?

02:43.234 --> 02:46.413
Oh, sorry.

02:46.437 --> 02:49.316
Um, listen, I'm sorry
your date's not going well.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.278
But I can't admit you, Susan.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.472
Right. Right.

02:56.347 --> 02:59.155
Jim, let's, uh, let's take
a look at those reflexes.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.157
Okay, I got a joke
for you, doctor.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.159
What's the correct medical term

03:03.183 --> 03:05.300
for the circumcision
of a rabbit?

03:05.324 --> 03:06.433
Hare cut.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.367
I don't... I always...

03:10.391 --> 03:13.240
Jim, I'm gonna need
to keep you here for awhile,

03:13.264 --> 03:14.477
run some tests. Really? I...

03:14.501 --> 03:17.444
Yeah, I'm still worried about
that bump on your head here. Ow!

03:17.468 --> 03:19.246
That's still...

03:19.270 --> 03:22.209
And, Susan, you're good to go.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.456
And though it only
lasted a moment,

03:24.480 --> 03:26.453
Jim caught the look that passed

03:26.477 --> 03:28.184
between his date...

03:28.208 --> 03:30.317
And his doctor.

03:30.341 --> 03:32.319
Thank you so much, Dr. Ron.

03:32.343 --> 03:35.262
And he suddenly got the feeling

03:35.286 --> 03:38.565
the joke was on him.

03:38.589 --> 03:46.589
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

04:22.262 --> 04:26.443
The annual blood drive was
a tradition on Wisteria Lane.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.547
Most residents came to help
promote health and well-being,

04:30.571 --> 04:35.322
but my friends turned up
for a different reason.

04:35.346 --> 04:37.384
They were growing
increasingly concerned

04:37.408 --> 04:39.326
that their street was infected

04:39.350 --> 04:43.290
with a dangerous
kind of sickness.

04:43.314 --> 04:45.601
And they came to consult
with one another

04:45.625 --> 04:47.534
about a possible cure.

04:47.558 --> 04:50.266
Oh, great,
she caught me staring.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.539
Have you guys noticed
how friendly Betty's been

04:52.563 --> 04:54.576
since that body was found
in front of her house?

04:54.600 --> 04:56.373
I don't trust friendly women.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.375
That's okay.
They don't trust you, either.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.476
I just know those two

04:59.500 --> 05:01.578
have something to do
with that dead body.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.350
Do we even know who he is?

05:03.374 --> 05:06.488
Well, the paper said the police
are withholding the details.

05:06.512 --> 05:08.284
Bree, maybe you should
call in a favor

05:08.308 --> 05:10.357
from your police detective pal,
have him poke around.

05:10.381 --> 05:12.359
That's a great idea.
You could have him do

05:12.383 --> 05:13.620
a background check
on the applewhites.

05:13.644 --> 05:15.427
I don't think I can do that.

05:15.451 --> 05:17.494
Why not? You said he was nice.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.496
Well, once he stopped suspecting
me of murdering Rex

05:19.520 --> 05:21.297
he was delightful,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.500
but, um...
I don't really know him.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.407
Well, somebody
has to do something,

05:25.431 --> 05:26.433
'cause I'm losing sleep.

05:26.457 --> 05:27.534
Betty! Matthew. Hi.

05:27.558 --> 05:30.337
Hello, everybody.

05:30.361 --> 05:32.639
Susan, a little birdie told me
you're having a birthday soon.

05:32.663 --> 05:35.482
We should all go out
and celebrate.

05:35.506 --> 05:36.643
Super.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.415
Sounds like a plan.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.587
Count me in.

05:40.611 --> 05:41.588
Bye.

05:41.612 --> 05:43.450
See ya.

05:43.474 --> 05:45.561
So why are you everybody's
best friend all of a sudden?

05:45.585 --> 05:47.554
If there was ever
a time to be neighborly,

05:47.578 --> 05:49.396
this is it.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.398
We're idiots for staying here.
I mean, we should've

05:51.422 --> 05:53.460
hit the road as soon as
they found Monroe's body.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.467
I mean, how do we know
he didn't tell foster

05:55.491 --> 05:56.663
where we're hiding?

05:56.687 --> 05:59.406
Because if he had, foster
would've shown up by now.

05:59.430 --> 06:01.568
And besides, if we take off,
what are we gonna live on?

06:01.592 --> 06:03.570
I have all of our money
tied up in this house.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.572
So why not just sell it?

06:05.596 --> 06:07.574
Patience, Matthew.
If we take off right away,

06:07.598 --> 06:09.376
it'll look suspicious.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.678
Now what we need is a story...

06:11.702 --> 06:14.452
A reason for us to move.

06:18.409 --> 06:20.356
Look at this, a-b negative.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.629
Yeah, it's the rarest
of all blood types.

06:22.653 --> 06:24.700
Well, there must be something
in the water around these parts.

06:24.724 --> 06:26.693
You're my second
a-b negative today.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.595
Seriously?

06:28.619 --> 06:30.397
Uh, who was it?

06:30.421 --> 06:31.761
That guy.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.514
Hi, Bree. Oh, hi.

06:47.538 --> 06:50.517
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice on my azaleas.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.519
They're just thriving.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.521
Oh, it was no trouble at all.

06:54.545 --> 06:58.465
Such a shame I may not
be around to enjoy them.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.697
Well, my mother has taken ill.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.530
And Matthew and I,
we'll probably go and visit her.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.732
We may even be moving.

07:05.756 --> 07:07.504
We just don't know yet.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.537
Oh, well, where does she live?

07:10.561 --> 07:12.439
Oh, back in Chicago.

07:12.463 --> 07:14.681
Is it serious?

07:14.705 --> 07:17.565
I-I don't know yet.

07:18.809 --> 07:21.648
Well, obviously, I'll be
speaking with her doctor.

07:21.672 --> 07:23.650
Oh, Betty, if there's
anything I can do,

07:23.674 --> 07:26.593
anything at all... Thank you.

07:26.617 --> 07:29.656
You've already done so much.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.720
Bye.

07:37.828 --> 07:40.607
Ow! Oh!

07:40.631 --> 07:41.808
That Dr. Ron called.

07:41.832 --> 07:43.810
He needs to see you
for a follow-up appointment.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.478
He needs to see me
or he wants to see me?

07:46.502 --> 07:48.615
Jeez, mom, how cute is this guy?

07:48.639 --> 07:51.748
Oh, he could be cuter...
But I don't know how.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.521
So ask him out.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.653
Oh, no, I can't do that.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.685
Mom, he's a cute surgeon.
What's the problem?

07:58.709 --> 08:01.658
He's young. Young?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.690
Younger than me.

08:03.714 --> 08:05.492
How much younger?

08:05.516 --> 08:07.494
Let's just say if I was
a senior in high school,

08:07.518 --> 08:10.597
I'd be saying, "wow,
you're a hot fifth grader."

08:10.621 --> 08:12.599
Oh, well, of course
it's gonna sound gross

08:12.623 --> 08:14.606
if you say it that way.
But you're both adults.

08:14.630 --> 08:16.472
So why not just ask him out?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.506
'Cause the conversation
could go something like this,

08:19.530 --> 08:21.508
"Dr. Ron, I think you're hot."

08:21.532 --> 08:22.709
"Oh, well, thank you, ma'am."

08:22.733 --> 08:25.690
"Now I think it's time we talk
about your hip replacement."

08:25.714 --> 08:31.487
Mom, you're hot
and funny and nice.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.818
And... clearly desperate,

08:32.842 --> 08:34.621
and guys are into that.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.784
Play to your strengths.

08:48.559 --> 08:49.706
Thank god you're home.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.738
What's wrong? Pat said you
told her it was an emergency!

08:51.762 --> 08:53.780
The boys were
sent home from school.

08:53.804 --> 08:56.891
What? Why? I called.
The machine kept picking up.

08:56.915 --> 08:59.515
I know. I know. Look, I...

08:59.539 --> 09:01.718
They've got chicken pox.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.551
Chicken pox?
That's the emergency?

09:04.575 --> 09:05.792
They're totally contagious.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.624
Not to us.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.895
They are to me!
I've never had it.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.757
Well, you never told me that.

09:10.781 --> 09:12.699
You know, the point is,
I can't go in there.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.731
It's a hot zone.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.834
Well, Tom, somebody's
gotta take care of our kids.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.667
Exactly.
And since you're immune...

09:20.691 --> 09:22.769
Oh, you've gotta be kidding!
I have to get back to work!

09:22.793 --> 09:25.647
Just for a couple of days,
until they're not contagious.

09:25.671 --> 09:27.614
It is not the ebola virus.
It's chicken pox.

09:27.638 --> 09:29.876
You are being a baby. Yes, I am.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.718
Okay.

09:31.742 --> 09:33.720
And if you think
I'm being a baby now,

09:33.744 --> 09:37.724
do I need to remind you
of what I'm like when I'm sick?

09:37.748 --> 09:40.757
Remember that time
I had strep throat?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.911
We wound up
in marriage counseling.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.915
I'll call the office.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.667
Thanks, honey.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.569
Uh, Mrs. Solis,
I gotta talk to you.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.571
Ralph, if this is about Luis

09:55.595 --> 09:56.773
overwatering
the hydrangeas again,

09:56.797 --> 09:59.906
I told you,
no one likes a tattletale. My wife left me.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.849
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:02.873 --> 10:05.687
I didn't know you and bonita
were having problems.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.684
We weren't.
Uh, it was all of a sudden.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.915
She just packed her bags
and left.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.718
She said I have an illness,
and I need to get help.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.720
Why?

10:13.744 --> 10:14.931
There's nothing wrong with me.

10:14.955 --> 10:17.824
I just like to look at
pretty ladies on the Internet.

10:17.848 --> 10:18.895
Uh-huh.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.897
And sure,
they're not always dressed,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.800
and sometimes,
there's more than one.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.602
But I only go to
the classy web sites.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.675
There's some really sick stuff
out there, Mrs. Solis.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.707
Ralph! Make your point.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.810
Um, last night, uh,
I found this new web site.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.817
And there was
a picture of a lady

10:35.841 --> 10:37.814
sitting on a bearskin rug
with nothing on

10:37.838 --> 10:40.717
except for a little pointy
elf hat. It was very festive.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.949
Uh, Ralph, why are you
telling me this?

10:42.973 --> 10:44.821
I'm sorry. It's just, um...

10:44.845 --> 10:48.845
Ahem. I think you really
need to see this.

10:52.022 --> 10:53.960
Oh, my god!

10:53.984 --> 10:55.937
The lighting looks great
on you, Mrs. Solis.

10:55.961 --> 10:59.005
I mean, most of the time,
you have to squint at the screen

10:59.029 --> 11:00.767
to see anything really good.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.008
And not here, no, sir,
that's good.

11:02.032 --> 11:04.811
Well, um, thank you, Ralph,

11:04.835 --> 11:06.843
for bringing this
to my attention.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.746
Uh, Mrs. Solis,
I was wondering...

11:09.770 --> 11:12.779
Would you sign that for me?

11:12.803 --> 11:13.973
Oh, okay.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.006
Where have you been?

11:35.030 --> 11:38.805
Why didn't you come to see me?

11:38.829 --> 11:40.676
I came every sunday.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.679
You were just too out of it
to know I was here.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.713
I think you're lying.

11:47.778 --> 11:48.955
But then again, these days,

11:48.979 --> 11:51.788
I think everyone's
been lying to me.

11:51.812 --> 11:56.993
The thing is, you're here now.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.967
So tell me what I wanna know.

12:00.991 --> 12:03.921
Did you find the man
who killed my daughter?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.051
It was a guy named
Todd forrest...

12:16.075 --> 12:18.845
This lowlife drug dealer.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.047
He got her hooked again.

12:21.071 --> 12:24.791
She tried to steal from him,
and he killed her.

12:24.815 --> 12:27.075
And I killed him.

12:32.883 --> 12:36.803
I thought hearing that
would make you happy.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.005
I thought it would, too.

12:39.029 --> 12:41.929
But it doesn't.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.913
Ow! I'm sorry.

12:46.937 --> 12:50.016
I wanna start your I.V.,
but your veins are kinda bad.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.978
Well, here, let me help you.

12:52.002 --> 12:53.950
Oh!

12:53.974 --> 12:56.752
What the hell are you doing?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.954
You're crazy!

12:57.978 --> 13:00.008
You're fired. Get out.

13:07.157 --> 13:10.937
So I guess we're done then?

13:10.961 --> 13:12.921
Yeah.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.975
You, uh...

13:18.999 --> 13:22.048
You gonna come see me again?

13:22.072 --> 13:26.082
You planning on having
an open casket?

13:46.997 --> 13:48.804
Oh! Close.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.877
Hey, guys. Hey.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.909
Hi, Lynette. Hi, Carlos.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.912
All right! A Reuben?
How sweet is that?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.143
Lunch brought right
to the golf course.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.115
I hear you got some
pretty sick kids in there.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.987
Oh, it's just chicken pox.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.950
But braveheart here will only
come in to sleep and shower.

14:03.974 --> 14:05.922
I can't say I blame him.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.054
I wouldn't want to be
shooting blanks either.

14:08.078 --> 14:10.026
Be well, my man, okay?
Bye, Lynette.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.198
See you later.

14:12.222 --> 14:14.909
I'm sorry, what did he mean,
"shooting blanks"?

14:14.933 --> 14:18.905
Oh, it's nothing. There's just
a small chance of sterility

14:18.929 --> 14:20.907
if a grown man
gets chicken pox, so...

14:20.931 --> 14:23.039
We're not having any more kids.
Why would it matter?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.116
I don't know.
You know, survival instinct?

14:25.140 --> 14:29.175
So that if you're the last man
to survive a nuclear holocaust,

14:29.199 --> 14:31.918
you could repopulate the planet?

14:31.942 --> 14:33.920
No, all I'm saying is that,

14:33.944 --> 14:36.131
god forbid something were
to happen to either one of us,

14:36.155 --> 14:39.055
I'd want either one of us
to have, you know, options.

14:39.079 --> 14:44.860
So you're saying
that if I died...

14:44.884 --> 14:47.001
You would want a second wife
and a family?

14:47.025 --> 14:49.065
Maybe.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.999
I can't believe you've
actually thought about this!

14:53.023 --> 14:54.941
Haven't you?

14:54.965 --> 14:58.074
Thought about who I'd marry
if you died? Hmm. No.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.107
Well, honey, it's a back-up
plan. I'm not gonna use it.

15:01.131 --> 15:03.109
Then why have it?

15:03.133 --> 15:05.120
Well, I don't know, because...

15:05.144 --> 15:07.984
It's like,
there's this door, right?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.186
And I'm not planning on actually
going through it

15:10.210 --> 15:13.019
because I'm so happy
in the room that I'm in.

15:13.043 --> 15:16.162
But in case of fire or flood,

15:16.186 --> 15:20.226
it's comforting to know
that the door is unlocked.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.098
Honey, I'm not
through with that!

15:22.122 --> 15:24.030
Yeah, well, why don't you have

15:24.054 --> 15:26.911
your second wife
make you lunch, okay? Oops!

15:26.935 --> 15:28.196
You...

15:30.961 --> 15:33.039
Bree, uh, I have to say,
I was, uh,

15:33.063 --> 15:35.216
I was very pleased
to get your call.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.244
I mean, I'm surprised you'd want
to have anything to do with me

15:38.268 --> 15:40.916
given our recent history.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.918
Oh, you mean
your having suspected me

15:42.942 --> 15:44.120
of murdering my husband?

15:44.144 --> 15:47.198
Detective, that is all
water under the bridge now.

15:47.222 --> 15:49.295
I am very glad
to hear you say that.

15:49.319 --> 15:52.928
Although, I have to confess,
I do have an ulterior motive.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.061
I need to ask you a favor.

15:55.085 --> 15:57.303
Oh, well, shoot,
whatever I can do.

15:57.327 --> 16:00.967
We have these, um,
new neighbors... the applewhites.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.109
It's a mother and her son. They
just moved here from Chicago.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.111
And they seem very nice.

16:05.135 --> 16:06.312
But there's...

16:06.336 --> 16:09.115
There's something about them
that's... off.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.978
They're... odd.

16:12.002 --> 16:14.280
Odd? Yeah,
they're secretive and watchful.

16:14.304 --> 16:17.158
And there was a dead body
found in front of their house.

16:17.182 --> 16:21.127
I can't run a background check
on your neighbors for being odd.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.329
Oh.

16:23.353 --> 16:26.262
Is that why you
wanted to see me?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.064
To... to ask me that?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.018
Yeah, why?

16:32.122 --> 16:35.101
Well, I just...
During the investigation,

16:35.125 --> 16:37.243
I just thought there was
a kind of a, um...

16:37.267 --> 16:39.105
Spark between us.

16:39.129 --> 16:42.199
You know, I thought
this might be a date.

16:45.075 --> 16:49.315
Uh, no. I just wanted
to ask you a favor.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.318
Fine, no harm done.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.320
When do I ever get to have lunch

16:54.344 --> 16:56.331
with such a lovely lady anyway?

16:56.355 --> 17:01.167
Date or... no date.

17:01.191 --> 17:04.270
Are you sure that you can't
check on the applewhites?

17:04.294 --> 17:06.377
I mean, I just know
that there's something there.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.135
And, you know, I have
a sixth sense about people.

17:09.159 --> 17:11.207
And yet,
you got engaged to the man

17:11.231 --> 17:13.161
who murdered your husband.

17:16.406 --> 17:18.384
Well, your blood pressure
looks fine.

17:18.407 --> 17:20.215
You're free to go, Mrs. Mayer.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.189
You mean, I'm not
gonna see Dr. Ron?

17:23.213 --> 17:25.126
Well, I do the follow-up exams.

17:25.150 --> 17:27.021
Dr. Ron only comes in
if there's a problem.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.295
Oh, well, maybe I should
go ahead and see him anyway,

17:29.319 --> 17:31.097
just to be safe.

17:31.121 --> 17:34.300
I'm sorry. Dr. Ron's schedule
is very tight today.

17:34.324 --> 17:37.064
So unless you're
having a serious problem...

17:39.259 --> 17:42.108
You're experiencing nausea,
chills and tingling, huh?

17:42.132 --> 17:44.240
Yeah, but now
that I think about it,

17:44.264 --> 17:46.117
I bet it's just
all the coffee I drink.

17:46.141 --> 17:47.413
I drink way too much coffee.

17:47.437 --> 17:50.045
Do you like to drink coffee?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.147
Uh, no.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.248
No.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.380
So the tingling is in
your fingers and your toes?

17:54.404 --> 17:57.258
I should switch to juice.
I know the best juice place.

17:57.282 --> 17:59.355
You would love it.
Do you drink juice?

17:59.379 --> 18:02.358
Wow. Susan, how often
have you been having

18:02.382 --> 18:05.331
these involuntary muscle spasms?

18:05.355 --> 18:09.095
Oh, oh, not that often.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.289
I probably just need
a good massage.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.440
Susan?

18:14.464 --> 18:17.103
Yeah?

18:17.127 --> 18:20.306
I wanna get you in for an m.R.I.

18:20.330 --> 18:24.210
Oh. Oh, oh, no, I don't think
that's necessary.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.352
Are you a doctor?

18:26.376 --> 18:28.454
I got high marks
in math and science.

18:28.478 --> 18:31.438
I wanna get you in for an m.R.I.

18:37.247 --> 18:38.464
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

18:38.488 --> 18:40.466
No, no, no, I think given
the misunderstanding

18:40.490 --> 18:42.468
that I should get the bill.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.130
I won't hear of it.

18:44.154 --> 18:46.302
All right, we'll split it.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.456
Fair enough.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.139
You know what?

18:53.163 --> 18:55.216
Let me, uh, let me
give you a ride home.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.284
Detective barton, is this some
sort of high school ploy

18:58.308 --> 19:00.286
to get me back to your place?

19:00.310 --> 19:02.388
I just don't think
you should be driving a car.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.190
You've been drinking.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.292
I had two glasses of wine.

19:06.316 --> 19:09.325
Three, plus the tawny port
with dessert.

19:09.349 --> 19:13.299
It's all here on the bill
if you wanna take a look.

19:13.323 --> 19:14.500
You know what?

19:14.524 --> 19:16.332
I politely rejected you,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.464
and now you're getting your
revenge by embarrassing me.

19:18.488 --> 19:21.337
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.261
I am not giving you anything.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.435
Except the bill.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.510
What do you think you're doing?

20:04.534 --> 20:07.261
I followed you to make sure
you were okay.

20:07.285 --> 20:09.285
You were weaving.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.457
Please step out of the car.

20:11.481 --> 20:13.519
Oh, you can't be serious.

20:13.543 --> 20:16.222
Out.

20:16.246 --> 20:20.566
Detective, I am not drunk,
and I am not stupid.

20:20.590 --> 20:23.329
I know exactly
what this is all about.

20:23.353 --> 20:25.406
I'm gonna need you to take
a sobriety test.

20:25.430 --> 20:28.474
A sobriety test? I'm not
taking any sobriety...

20:28.498 --> 20:31.407
Test.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.480
This behavior stems from
the hurt feelings

20:34.504 --> 20:36.491
of a man with
very low self-esteem.

20:36.515 --> 20:38.484
The world is a big place,

20:38.508 --> 20:41.487
and I'm sure there is
a woman out there somewhere

20:41.511 --> 20:44.550
who'll respond
to your macho posturing.

20:44.574 --> 20:47.423
Well...

20:47.447 --> 20:49.247
Here's hoping.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.270
Baby, what you're about to see

21:04.294 --> 21:06.451
will most likely shock
and upset you.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.243
Okay.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.377
Remember Scott, the photographer
I was dating when we met?

21:11.401 --> 21:13.379
The one I dumped for you,

21:13.403 --> 21:15.381
who never really got over it

21:15.405 --> 21:18.424
and who I always said was
gonna get back at me? Mm-hmm.

21:18.448 --> 21:22.558
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.452
Move.

21:27.357 --> 21:28.464
What is this?

21:28.488 --> 21:30.466
Scott's web site,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.620
with pictures of me on it.

21:36.466 --> 21:39.305
Well, say something.

21:39.329 --> 21:40.506
Oh, my god.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.508
It was supposed to be funny...

21:42.532 --> 21:45.489
A naughty little Christmas gift
for my boyfriend.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.613
Oh, my god!

21:47.637 --> 21:52.588
I know, I was freakishly
flexible back then.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.390
I'm sorry!

21:54.414 --> 21:56.297
Look, what are we gonna do
about this?

21:56.321 --> 21:57.663
I guess I'll call my lawyers.

21:57.687 --> 22:00.666
I gave these pictures to him
as a gift. He owns them.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.428
Then I guess we're screwed.

22:02.452 --> 22:05.509
Not necessarily.
See, here's what I'm thinking...

22:05.533 --> 22:07.473
Scott's a coward,

22:07.497 --> 22:09.535
so you could totally
put the scare into him.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.478
All you gotta do
is go and rough him up,

22:12.502 --> 22:15.416
and he'll take my pictures
off the web site like that.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.443
I'm sorry, but this
is your mistake.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.445
You're gonna have to
fix it yourself.

22:19.469 --> 22:20.586
And I would love to,

22:20.610 --> 22:22.588
but I have the upper body
strength of a kitten.

22:22.612 --> 22:24.590
I need a brute!

22:24.614 --> 22:26.592
Gaby, I am just now starting

22:26.616 --> 22:28.616
to get my rage issues
under control.

22:29.679 --> 22:32.398
This brute doesn't swing
that way anymore,

22:32.422 --> 22:34.430
so go find another.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.641
Well, when you left prison,

22:35.665 --> 22:38.725
did they leave you
a contact list?

22:47.637 --> 22:49.715
So is Dr. Ron gonna
be here for this?

22:49.739 --> 22:51.517
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.519
Uh, there's a hook
on the wall there

22:53.543 --> 22:55.521
so go ahead
and get your stuff hung up

22:55.545 --> 22:57.623
and, uh, just get comfy. Dr. Ron
should be here pretty soon.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.507
Okay. Okay.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.650
Is she trying
to put on the dust cover?

23:16.674 --> 23:17.766
Yep.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.520
How long are we
gonna let this go on?

23:25.544 --> 23:27.382
Just a few more minutes.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.585
Hi, uh, Susan?

23:29.609 --> 23:31.717
It's Dr. Ron.

23:31.741 --> 23:34.511
You don't have to
get undressed for this.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.494
Oh, uh, i-i, uh...

23:38.518 --> 23:41.527
Then why did you put out a gown?

23:41.551 --> 23:43.529
No, no, it's not a gown.

23:43.553 --> 23:46.463
It's the dust cover
for the m.R.I. Machine.

23:49.699 --> 23:51.677
This should take
about 45 minutes.

23:51.701 --> 23:54.740
Now I know it's really cramped
and uncomfortable in there,

23:54.764 --> 23:56.542
but try not to move.

23:56.566 --> 23:57.783
Susan, I realize
that this whole process

23:57.807 --> 23:59.615
must be troubling for you.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.588
Yeah, it's pretty troubling.

24:02.612 --> 24:05.499
Well, we're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

24:05.523 --> 24:08.445
And I'll be here for you, okay?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.458
Hey, Dr. Ron?

24:12.482 --> 24:13.659
I just have a feeling

24:13.683 --> 24:16.462
that everything's
gonna turn out fine.

24:16.486 --> 24:18.504
And when it does...

24:18.528 --> 24:20.506
I'd like to buy you dinner

24:20.530 --> 24:22.437
to celebrate my health.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.670
You know, I was thinking
maybe Italian?

24:24.694 --> 24:28.644
Oh, what the heck,
maybe we can call it a date.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.768
If you like.

24:34.844 --> 24:36.682
Dr. Ron?

24:36.706 --> 24:38.684
Uh, he left awhile ago.

24:38.708 --> 24:41.778
He got a phone call
from his girlfriend.

24:43.813 --> 24:45.731
Oh.

24:45.755 --> 24:48.494
Okay.

24:48.518 --> 24:49.765
Thank you.

24:51.761 --> 24:53.839
I'd like to get out now.

24:53.863 --> 24:56.833
Try not to move.

25:15.645 --> 25:17.763
Good morning, Luis, Ralph.

25:17.787 --> 25:19.565
Good morning, Mrs. Solis.

25:19.589 --> 25:20.766
Good morning, honey.

25:20.790 --> 25:22.698
Hey, you're talking to me again.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.630
Well, I thought
about what you said...

25:24.654 --> 25:26.811
About the pictures...
And you're right.

25:26.835 --> 25:30.526
It was my mistake
and I have to live with it.

25:58.888 --> 26:01.607
What the hell are you doing?!

26:01.631 --> 26:02.831
I'm living with it!

26:05.595 --> 26:07.913
Hey, turn around
and keep gardening!

26:07.937 --> 26:10.545
Aw, you're so mean.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.848
Put your clothes on right now.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.681
Why? You either care
if men leer at me or not.

26:15.705 --> 26:17.783
And you made it clear that
you don't. So what's the point?

26:17.807 --> 26:19.885
Gabrielle, I am not beating
this guy up for you!

26:19.909 --> 26:22.588
Then you better think of another
way to get my pictures back.

26:22.612 --> 26:24.590
Because if you don't,
people on Wisteria Lane

26:24.614 --> 26:26.771
are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me!

26:26.795 --> 26:28.856
Ralph, Luis, feast your eyes!

26:30.720 --> 26:32.738
Aah! Aah! My finger!

26:35.625 --> 26:37.572
I'll find it! I'll find it! Aah,
my finger!

26:37.596 --> 26:39.605
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I'll look for it, man.

26:39.629 --> 26:41.729
Don't worry,
man. I'll find it. Oh, my finger!

26:43.633 --> 26:47.653
Hey, honey, good news.

26:47.677 --> 26:48.954
I checked on penny,

26:48.978 --> 26:50.886
and she didn't scream.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.918
I think she's getting used
to the mask.

26:52.942 --> 26:55.952
I don't want you
to have options, Tom.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.796
If I die, I wanna hear
your life would be over.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.799
I want you to spend
the rest of your life screaming,

27:03.823 --> 27:06.732
"it should've been me
on that plane!"

27:06.756 --> 27:08.634
Plane?

27:08.658 --> 27:10.806
I'm assuming there was a crash.
It could've been something else.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.778
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:12.802 --> 27:14.780
Do you have any idea
how painful it is to hear

27:14.804 --> 27:16.991
about you even think
about your next wife and kids?

27:17.015 --> 27:18.784
I could never do that!

27:18.808 --> 27:21.616
I can't imagine my life
without you.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.888
You are my everything!

27:22.912 --> 27:24.619
Honey, you're my everything.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.960
Okay, well, that's easy to say,

27:25.984 --> 27:27.853
but I need you to show me.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.624
How?

27:29.648 --> 27:30.978
With a vasectomy.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.936
Can't I just
get you some flowers?

27:35.960 --> 27:37.733
Look, it makes perfect sense.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.735
We're not gonna have
any more kids.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.807
And the pill just makes
me bloat. It'll be great!

27:41.831 --> 27:44.910
No, okay, Lynette,
this is crazy. Oh, I know! I know!

27:44.934 --> 27:47.873
But it is what
married people do.

27:47.897 --> 27:51.897
They go out of their way to calm
each other's irrational fears.

27:53.903 --> 27:55.650
Oh, come on, Tom.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.684
I really need you to do this.

28:00.009 --> 28:02.657
Well, okay.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.929
Fine, yeah.

28:03.953 --> 28:06.692
I'll make an appointment.

28:06.716 --> 28:08.916
Thank you.

28:25.875 --> 28:27.953
Hey, can I ask you somethin'?

28:27.977 --> 28:30.037
I'd rather you didn't.

28:32.782 --> 28:34.790
How'd you get started?

28:34.814 --> 28:37.022
Started?

28:37.046 --> 28:39.024
You know,
in the escort business?

28:39.048 --> 28:40.896
I beg your pardon.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.068
I bet the guys go crazy
with your whole...

28:43.092 --> 28:45.976
Classy, repressed thing
you got going on, huh?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.903
I mean, your skin has, like,

28:47.927 --> 28:49.735
no pores.

28:49.759 --> 28:50.936
I am not sure,

28:50.960 --> 28:53.038
but I think there was
a compliment in there somewhere,

28:53.062 --> 28:54.740
so thank you.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.021
But I am not an escort.

28:56.045 --> 28:58.713
How much you charge a night?

28:58.737 --> 28:59.837
Look, I'm...

29:03.072 --> 29:04.950
$5,000.

29:04.974 --> 29:07.853
Whoa.

29:07.877 --> 29:10.055
What do you have to do
exactly for 5 grand?

29:10.079 --> 29:12.779
Hmm.

29:13.983 --> 29:15.083
All right.

29:16.085 --> 29:18.804
Your bail cleared.
You're free to go.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.035
Your car's at the impound lot.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.768
And you can pick it up
in the morning.

29:22.792 --> 29:25.740
Well, how am I supposed to get home?
I don't have any money. Call a friend.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.078
I have been through enough
humiliation for one day.

29:28.102 --> 29:30.115
I hope you have a better
suggestion than that.

29:30.139 --> 29:33.979
Okay, well, let me think, um...

29:34.003 --> 29:36.153
Walk.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.786
Oh, for goodness sakes!

29:56.165 --> 30:00.005
Bree? Is everything okay?

30:00.029 --> 30:04.079
Oh, oh, I'm fine.
I just, um, had a flat tire.

30:04.103 --> 30:08.783
It's your lucky day. I'm a whiz
at changing tires. Hop in.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.015
You know, thank you,

30:10.039 --> 30:11.917
but I think it's actually
something more mechanical.

30:11.941 --> 30:14.990
My car has been making
just a terrible noise.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.894
Well, I have auto club.

30:18.187 --> 30:20.047
Come on.

30:24.894 --> 30:29.834
Actually, my car has been
impounded by the police.

30:42.972 --> 30:45.020
Thanks, Betty, and, um...

30:45.044 --> 30:47.027
I'd appreciate it
if you could keep

30:47.051 --> 30:49.154
this little incident
to yourself.

30:49.178 --> 30:51.156
I won't say a word. I swear.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.958
Well, that's good to hear,

30:52.982 --> 30:55.830
because most people on this
street couldn't keep a secret

30:55.854 --> 30:57.908
if their lives depended on it. Well,
Bree,

30:57.932 --> 31:01.066
even if everyone does find out,
it's no big deal.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.038
I mean, lots of people
have d.U.I.S.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.040
Yes, but the difference is
most of those people

31:05.064 --> 31:06.981
were actually drunk
when they were arrested.

31:07.005 --> 31:08.173
I was not.

31:08.197 --> 31:10.845
Well, of course.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.949
You know, you sound like
you don't believe me.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.183
Well, um, it's just...

31:18.948 --> 31:21.056
I know you've gone through
a lot lately...

31:21.080 --> 31:24.930
The death of your husband,
problems with your son.

31:24.954 --> 31:29.134
It would only be natural
if you did self-medicate.

31:29.158 --> 31:31.136
I'm sorry, but since
when do you know

31:31.160 --> 31:33.999
so much about my personal life?

31:34.023 --> 31:37.072
Bree, it's like you said...

31:37.096 --> 31:40.075
The people on this street are
not great at keeping secrets.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.908
Except for you.

31:42.932 --> 31:44.109
You're really good at it.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.880
I beg your pardon.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.091
Well, you moved into your house
in the middle of the night.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.085
God knows what you moved in

31:50.109 --> 31:52.057
that you didn't want
anybody to see.

31:52.081 --> 31:55.890
People hear sounds
coming at all hours from there.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.897
And, oh, what was the last one?
Oh, right...

31:57.921 --> 32:00.895
They found a dead body
in front of your home.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.197
Everybody talks about
the applewhites,

32:02.221 --> 32:03.999
but nobody can figure out

32:04.023 --> 32:07.032
exactly what you people
are hiding.

32:07.056 --> 32:09.204
So congratulations.
Your secrets are safe...

32:09.228 --> 32:11.058
For now.

32:28.017 --> 32:32.027
Edie? Hi, it's Betty applewhite.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.961
Yeah, I'm sorry
to call you so late but, um...

32:35.985 --> 32:39.164
I really need to meet with you
first thing in the morning.

32:39.188 --> 32:41.106
Yes.

32:41.130 --> 32:45.960
Well, I've decided
to sell my house.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.149
Dr. Ron?

32:54.173 --> 32:55.950
What are you doing here?

32:55.974 --> 32:58.183
Uh, we need to talk.

32:58.207 --> 33:00.285
And it's not the kind of talk
we can have over the phone.

33:00.309 --> 33:02.287
Oh, are you sure?

33:02.311 --> 33:04.289
Um, because
I would look a lot better

33:04.313 --> 33:07.032
over the phone right now.

33:07.056 --> 33:11.256
Um, Susan, your, uh,
your test results came back.

33:13.062 --> 33:16.971
And for the life of me,
I can't figure it out.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.173
Now based on the...

33:18.197 --> 33:20.075
On the symptoms you
were describing... symptoms?

33:20.099 --> 33:22.247
Yeah, the dizziness,
the tingling, the muscle spasms,

33:22.271 --> 33:24.309
the chills...
It could be neurological.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.217
It also could be based
on an autoimmune disorder.

33:27.241 --> 33:29.084
I just... frankly, I'm stumped.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.116
Oh, no, no, no, no.

33:31.140 --> 33:34.059
Hey, listen, we're gonna
get through this, okay?

33:34.083 --> 33:36.161
I am so sorry.

33:36.185 --> 33:38.363
But I'm not sick.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.325
What are you talking about?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.999
Your nurse wouldn't
let me see you, and I...

33:45.023 --> 33:46.210
Really wanted to see you,

33:46.234 --> 33:49.334
so I sort of faked
all my symptoms.

33:49.358 --> 33:52.137
The dizziness, the chills,
you know, all of it.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.139
Why... why would you
do something like that?

33:54.163 --> 33:56.146
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:56.170 --> 33:58.243
I know. I know.
I feel really awful.

33:58.267 --> 34:01.086
I am just not the best
at meeting men.

34:01.110 --> 34:03.088
And I thought you were cute,
and I sort of thought

34:03.112 --> 34:05.350
that maybe you thought
I was cute, and you're a doctor,

34:05.374 --> 34:07.021
and that's so sexy.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.293
So I was up all night
worried sick

34:08.317 --> 34:10.094
digging through medical books,

34:10.119 --> 34:12.025
trying to figure out
some mysterious disease

34:12.050 --> 34:13.228
that doesn't really exist?

34:13.252 --> 34:15.159
Really? You were up all night?

34:15.184 --> 34:17.170
Yes. I don't enjoy
telling people

34:17.195 --> 34:19.204
I think they're going to die.

34:19.228 --> 34:22.107
Especially not people
I like. You like me?

34:22.130 --> 34:23.237
Yes.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.270
What about your
girlfriend? What girlfriend?

34:25.293 --> 34:27.377
The one who called
in the m.R.I. Room?

34:27.400 --> 34:30.344
We had one date. She wanted
a referral to a dermatologist.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.118
She's got eczema.

34:33.141 --> 34:34.172
Oh!

34:36.445 --> 34:39.445
Maybe we could go out sometime?

34:45.154 --> 34:46.364
Do you like Sushi?

34:48.117 --> 34:52.097
I love Sushi.
I'm available tomorrow night.

34:52.121 --> 34:54.239
No, no, no, tomorrow's no good.
I'll still be angry.

34:54.263 --> 34:56.070
I should be cooled down
by Friday.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.274
Oh, uh, Friday's good.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.106
Oh, there's one thing...

35:01.130 --> 35:04.309
Your m.R.I. Showed that you have
a wandering spleen.

35:04.333 --> 35:06.080
A what?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.082
It's a wandering spleen.
It's no big deal.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.414
Sometimes the thing
just moves around in there.

35:09.438 --> 35:11.238
But we'll keep an eye on it.

35:16.185 --> 35:18.215
Wandering what?

35:22.321 --> 35:26.301
Okay, go get him, tiger.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.303
I can't do it, Gaby.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.235
What?

35:30.259 --> 35:33.238
I can't go in there.
I thought I could, but I can't.

35:33.262 --> 35:34.439
You promised!

35:34.463 --> 35:36.486
Ever since I got out of prison,

35:36.510 --> 35:38.413
I've been trying
to lead a better life.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.485
And for the first time,
I can honestly say

35:40.509 --> 35:43.148
that I'm a good catholic,
and I don't want to ruin that.

35:43.172 --> 35:47.452
So do this today and go to
an extra long mass tomorrow.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.254
It doesn't work that way.

35:49.278 --> 35:50.455
Okay, look, I'm really trying

35:50.479 --> 35:54.259
to understand
your moral dilemma here, I am.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.266
But if you don't get
my pictures back,

35:56.290 --> 35:57.462
I'm gonna be humiliated.

35:57.486 --> 35:59.264
You think our gardener

35:59.288 --> 36:02.136
is the only local perv
surfing the web?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.468
I'm sorry, Gabrielle.

36:03.492 --> 36:05.270
You used to go crazy

36:05.294 --> 36:08.218
when men would so much
as look at me the wrong way...

36:08.242 --> 36:10.175
And that's when
I had clothes on.

36:10.199 --> 36:11.476
I'm trying to be
better than that now.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.349
Or maybe you just don't love me
as much as you used to.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.287
Why can't you just let me
be a good person?

36:17.311 --> 36:19.284
You know,
if you really loved me,

36:19.308 --> 36:21.356
you wouldn't even ask me
to go in there.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.450
If you really loved me,
I wouldn't have to ask!

36:28.257 --> 36:30.435
Fine, forget it.

36:30.459 --> 36:33.338
Really?

36:33.362 --> 36:37.242
Be a good person.
Knock yourself out.

36:37.266 --> 36:40.505
It's not that
I don't love you. I...

36:40.529 --> 36:43.329
Yeah, okay, look,
let's just go home.

36:50.579 --> 36:52.557
What are you doing?

36:52.581 --> 36:55.211
I'm getting your pictures back.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.254
I'm not gonna hurt him.

36:59.418 --> 37:03.418
I'll talk to him,
appeal to his better nature.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.541
Can I help you?

37:16.565 --> 37:19.484
I'm Carlos solis.

37:19.508 --> 37:23.248
You have, uh, naked pictures
of my wife on your web site.

37:23.272 --> 37:25.490
Oh.

37:25.514 --> 37:28.393
You're, uh...

37:28.417 --> 37:31.296
Gabrielle's husband? Uh-huh.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.298
Well, you know what?

37:33.322 --> 37:35.430
I was just about
to take those off anyway.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.363
Oh.

37:38.387 --> 37:39.604
That's great.

37:42.391 --> 37:45.610
I really appreciate this, Scott.

37:45.634 --> 37:47.412
Hey, no problem.

37:47.436 --> 37:49.414
To tell you the truth,
Gabrielle's pages

37:49.438 --> 37:51.476
weren't exactly raking in
the big bucks for me.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.378
I find that hard to believe.

37:53.402 --> 37:56.250
I'm not saying Gabrielle's not
a pretty girl. Of course she is.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.484
But, uh, she ain't exactly
Internet pretty, you know?

38:01.510 --> 38:03.488
What does that mean?

38:03.512 --> 38:05.630
The web's about fantasy,
not fashion.

38:05.654 --> 38:07.432
I mean, guys surfing for porn,

38:07.456 --> 38:09.534
they don't care how the clothes
are hanging off the body.

38:09.558 --> 38:11.336
They just wanna see the goods.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.338
So, uh, if little miss nasty
ain't rocking some curves...

38:13.362 --> 38:14.639
My wife has a perfect figure.

38:14.663 --> 38:16.441
Don't get me wrong.

38:16.465 --> 38:20.345
Our little Gaby knows how to,
uh... work a runway,

38:20.369 --> 38:22.507
but, uh, when it comes
to cyber lovin'?

38:22.531 --> 38:24.479
No real man's gonna
waste tissue on that.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.620
There you go. That's all of 'em.

38:26.644 --> 38:29.375
So we cool now?

38:43.622 --> 38:46.432
Now that's my guy.

38:58.567 --> 38:59.637
Hey.

39:01.510 --> 39:02.587
Hey.

39:02.611 --> 39:04.389
You're not limping.

39:04.413 --> 39:07.392
Did everything go okay?

39:07.416 --> 39:09.494
I couldn't do it.

39:09.518 --> 39:11.648
What happened?

39:13.652 --> 39:15.430
I don't know.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.631
I got there, I...

39:16.655 --> 39:21.436
I put on the paper gown
and I, uh...

39:21.460 --> 39:23.438
I just couldn't do it.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.370
Why not?

39:25.394 --> 39:27.347
It felt like
I was being emasculated.

39:27.371 --> 39:29.343
Oh, please.
I'm serious, Lynette.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.476
I don't make the money
around here anymore.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.548
I don't provide
for you and the kids.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.450
And I wasn't gonna
let them snip out

39:35.474 --> 39:37.461
the last thing
that makes me a man.

39:37.485 --> 39:40.425
Staying home
and taking care of the kids

39:40.449 --> 39:42.427
doesn't make you less of a man.

39:42.451 --> 39:43.688
That's crazy.

39:43.712 --> 39:46.569
You expect me to calm
your irrational fears?

39:46.593 --> 39:49.385
I expect you to calm mine.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.698
Are you saying you're unhappy?

40:04.603 --> 40:06.443
A little bit, yeah.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.558
Well, what are we gonna do
about that?

40:13.582 --> 40:15.590
I don't know.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.423
Well, can't we just...

40:18.447 --> 40:20.725
No, Lynette...

40:20.749 --> 40:23.449
I don't know.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.418
Hi, it's detective barton.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.420
Look, I feel awful about
what happened the other day.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.728
I was a jerk.
So to make it up to you,

40:48.752 --> 40:50.725
I did some sniffing around
about the dead man

40:50.749 --> 40:52.727
they found in front
of your neighbor's house.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.529
I've got some information.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.740
His name was Curtis Monroe...
A private detective

40:56.764 --> 40:59.734
who lost his license
a couple of years ago.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.706
He's apparently from Chicago.

41:01.730 --> 41:04.438
Now I don't know if any of this
is helpful, but...

41:05.463 --> 41:06.780
a couple of years ago.

41:06.804 --> 41:09.443
He's apparently from Chicago.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.478
Now I don't know if any of this
is helpful,

41:13.502 --> 41:15.650
but I just feel terrible
about what happened...

41:15.674 --> 41:18.523
Illnesses can take on
many forms.

41:18.547 --> 41:21.686
Those of the body
are easy to treat.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.758
Much more difficult

41:23.782 --> 41:28.663
are the hidden maladies
that fester in our hearts...

41:28.687 --> 41:32.487
The secret addictions
that consume our souls...

41:34.523 --> 41:39.503
And the diseases we deny
which affect our judgment.

41:43.732 --> 41:45.680
To survive, we need to find

41:45.704 --> 41:49.684
that special someone
who can heal us.

41:49.708 --> 41:53.487
I worked so hard all my life...

41:53.511 --> 41:55.820
So hard.

41:55.844 --> 41:59.794
Now it's all nothing.

41:59.818 --> 42:04.498
I got one daughter I hate
and one who hates me

42:04.522 --> 42:09.704
and one dead before her time.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.728
No one left for me now.

42:13.702 --> 42:15.832
Oh, what did I do it for?

42:19.808 --> 42:22.687
That was good.

42:22.711 --> 42:24.571
I didn't feel a thing.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.853
I have enough pain.

42:28.877 --> 42:31.626
I don't need anymore.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.628
But we can never predict

42:33.652 --> 42:36.761
who will have the cure
for what ails us...

42:36.785 --> 42:40.735
The other nurses all warned me
you were difficult, Mr. Taylor.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.829
Or when they'll show up.

42:45.594 --> 42:48.604
But I think we're gonna
get along just fine.
