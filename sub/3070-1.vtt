01:16.205 --> 01:17.084
Jacob!

01:17.085 --> 01:19.085
What are you up to?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.530
Watch this guys!

01:55.690 --> 01:56.991
Fire!

02:14.003 --> 02:15.113
Hey!

02:15.633 --> 02:17.164
- Hey get down!
- Fuck!

02:24.565 --> 02:25.385
Jacob!

02:27.135 --> 02:28.345
Jacob!

03:00.200 --> 03:03.420
We're talking about school
suspension this time.

03:04.531 --> 03:07.090
Six months at Rawlins.

03:07.091 --> 03:10.143
Sheriff Armstrong says if you
cooperate he might consider.

03:10.144 --> 03:11.444
I was the only one.

03:11.862 --> 03:15.702
- Don't bullshit me.
- I don't rat on my crew.

03:20.953 --> 03:22.363
Look at me!

03:27.324 --> 03:31.475
You almost dragged
your brother in all this.

03:32.395 --> 03:35.405
Is that what you wanted?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.506
Take responsibility Jacob.

03:52.748 --> 03:53.908
Alright.

04:07.870 --> 04:11.090
- It's gone.
- Fuckin' asshole!

04:19.902 --> 04:22.911
Jacob!
- Let me go!

04:22.912 --> 04:24.751
Jacob!

04:24.752 --> 04:27.392
Step back, Jacob!

04:27.393 --> 04:30.323
How am I supposed to ride?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.433
By getting your act
together, that's how.

04:34.434 --> 04:37.823
Mom gave it to me, and I hate you...

04:37.824 --> 04:41.155
so fucking much.

04:42.555 --> 04:44.395
'The fuck you lookin' at?

05:05.358 --> 05:07.799
Look I didn't mean
to push you like that.

05:46.434 --> 05:48.494
I will take
ownership for my actions.

05:48.495 --> 05:51.435
And the consequences
of those actions.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.006
Again.

05:54.376 --> 05:59.406
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

05:59.786 --> 06:01.797
You've got something to say, son?

06:07.228 --> 06:08.768
We're all ears.

06:13.949 --> 06:18.038
'Just been here first week, I'm gonna
cut you some slack, alright?

06:18.039 --> 06:21.039
Son, you got it easy
on this side of the fence.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.040
You understand?

06:23.810 --> 06:27.800
You get to go home at night,
sleep in your warm snuggly bed.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.980
But you best start giving a dam.

06:29.981 --> 06:33.490
Else you'll wind up over there
in Juvie with the big boys.

06:33.491 --> 06:37.091
'You sure as hell ain't going
home to your mommy and daddy.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.251
You'll be locked up.

06:39.252 --> 06:42.753
Crying and pissing
yourself to sleep every night.

06:43.413 --> 06:45.032
On the ground.

06:45.033 --> 06:47.033
Gimme 50.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.334
Now!

06:55.725 --> 06:56.604
Again.

06:56.605 --> 07:01.476
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

07:02.056 --> 07:03.275
Again.

07:03.276 --> 07:08.417
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

07:31.530 --> 07:34.220
Come on, let's go.

07:38.511 --> 07:39.931
In your bed.

07:50.343 --> 07:53.663
Hey, go back to sleep, alright?

09:41.999 --> 09:45.940
Triple-D's, holy shit!

09:47.450 --> 09:50.160
Hell, I'd give her the "D".

09:56.441 --> 09:58.341
Like that one?

09:58.342 --> 10:01.271
Hey, put that shit away.

10:01.272 --> 10:05.392
It's all good. -He's my fucking
brother, get up you're going home.

10:05.393 --> 10:09.483
I wanna stay with you guys.
- I said no, go!

10:10.603 --> 10:14.993
'Hear about that kid Ray Martin
got stabbed in Juvie last year?

10:14.994 --> 10:16.994
Fuckin' died, man.

10:19.345 --> 10:23.454
Who's next?
- Me go home.

10:23.455 --> 10:25.456
Sorry, little man.

10:25.806 --> 10:29.276
Let me have some.
- Get your own bag!

10:33.327 --> 10:35.846
He's gotten way faster.
- Oh yeah.

10:35.847 --> 10:38.207
Yeah, he has.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.708
You should totally race again.
- Yeah, I know.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.798
Holy shit look, more at Linden.

10:48.799 --> 10:50.798
Hey girls!

10:50.799 --> 10:53.449
More at Linden.
- God dam!

10:53.450 --> 10:55.449
'Things I would do to that.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.450
You talk to her or what?

10:58.380 --> 11:00.200
I don't know.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.730
Show us your tits!
- WTF Lance!

11:02.731 --> 11:04.730
Talk to the ladies it's all good.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.941
They're leaving, great going!

11:06.942 --> 11:09.961
Come on don't be like this, come back.
- Fucking idiot, dude.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.172
Gimme a sec.

11:12.893 --> 11:15.262
Well, well, well.

11:15.263 --> 11:18.492
Hey.
- Hi honey.

11:18.493 --> 11:21.013
What are you trouble makers up to?

11:21.014 --> 11:24.933
Just hanging out.
- Yah, hangin' out.

11:24.934 --> 11:29.125
It's all we're doing, I swear.
- Where's your dad?

11:29.255 --> 11:30.945
Pff! 'Fuck if I know.

11:32.815 --> 11:36.886
You know, you're getting yourself
quite a reputation around here.

11:39.797 --> 11:42.886
Come on Jacob.
- Hey, Jacob.

11:42.887 --> 11:45.287
Hey, whatever.

11:49.928 --> 11:53.279
Dude, she's hot. -Shut up.
-It's his aunt.

12:13.381 --> 12:16.301
Get over here and sit down.
- I'm not hungry.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.461
You gotta eat somethin'.

12:18.462 --> 12:21.143
Don't make me get up outa this chair.

12:39.735 --> 12:40.695
Here.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.946
Come on.

12:46.886 --> 12:50.537
Dad was out in Galveston today.
- Wes.

12:52.867 --> 12:55.428
I'm taking another
crack at the place.

12:56.988 --> 12:59.818
God, destroyed it for a reason.

13:01.989 --> 13:06.379
We're gonna move there.
- Wes, eat your dinner.

13:07.930 --> 13:10.719
I'm not moving there.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.720
Sit down.

13:19.941 --> 13:21.291
Dick!

13:22.632 --> 13:24.592
What was that?

13:34.533 --> 13:38.414
How many times you' gonna
play that stupid song?

13:39.064 --> 13:41.814
Leave your brother alone.

13:44.295 --> 13:47.525
Wes, come on, sit up.

14:45.244 --> 14:48.103
Hey, Wes, get up.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.374
Come on.

14:50.545 --> 14:53.155
Wes, let's go.

14:55.445 --> 14:57.096
Hurry up.

15:00.766 --> 15:03.216
Alright, let's go.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.260
It's all you.

15:35.721 --> 15:39.092
Look, you're the one who
wanna be part of the crew.

15:40.892 --> 15:44.283
He ain't gon' do it.
- Shut up.

16:07.776 --> 16:10.456
Holy shit, he did it.

16:13.217 --> 16:15.337
Shit.
- Come on, come on.

16:15.417 --> 16:16.817
We gotta go.

16:25.229 --> 16:26.918
Hey, stop right here.

16:26.919 --> 16:31.479
Jacob.
- Let's go, Wes, come on.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.780
Go, go, go.

16:44.181 --> 16:45.962
Come on, speed up.

16:48.462 --> 16:49.582
Stop.

16:55.543 --> 16:57.423
Call the cops Jenks.

17:17.306 --> 17:21.146
Look, you can't tell anyone, okay?

17:21.146 --> 17:23.146
No one.

17:27.098 --> 17:30.947
It's okay, I swear.

17:30.948 --> 17:34.448
I won't let anything happen to you.

17:34.449 --> 17:36.449
Hey.

17:37.309 --> 17:39.829
You did good, alright.

17:39.830 --> 17:42.529
You're gonna stop crying.

17:42.530 --> 17:44.730
Go to sleep.

17:54.602 --> 17:56.242
Jacob.

17:57.392 --> 18:01.302
What if we really went
to Galveston like Mom wanted?

18:01.303 --> 18:04.273
I'm not going anywhere.

18:17.985 --> 18:20.829
"Would you like to try
our new 'quiet' burger.

18:20.842 --> 18:24.795
- No thanks Ted, I'll just have
an order of crazy fries.".

18:24.796 --> 18:27.677
- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?
- Ham.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.128
"Watch out, there's enough
rat poison in this dip-cone ".

18:46.329 --> 18:48.819
I want some.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.820
Hey, you asked for ham.

19:22.835 --> 19:24.325
Who is it?

19:42.248 --> 19:44.148
Hi boys!

19:46.408 --> 19:50.769
I'm Mrs. Roberts and this is
Officer Gardner, how are you doing?

19:52.949 --> 19:54.559
It's yours?

19:58.940 --> 20:00.250
No.

20:01.021 --> 20:05.270
Well, how about I leave it here
just in case it is.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.570
Whatever.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.571
Is your dad home, boys?

20:09.572 --> 20:11.571
Why you all here?

20:11.572 --> 20:13.982
Let's go inside, come on.
- What do you want?

20:15.413 --> 20:17.013
It's alright.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.546
Look, I told you, yo'all
can't be here, okay?

20:44.547 --> 20:48.467
Look, my dad will be back later,
you can come back then.

21:02.899 --> 21:05.500
Can I talk to you for a second?

21:06.060 --> 21:08.150
Let's go in here, come on.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.231
Come on.

21:18.992 --> 21:20.901
- You can't do this.
- No.

21:20.902 --> 21:24.493
Where do they take me, Jacob?

21:26.133 --> 21:30.272
I need you to get in the car.

21:30.273 --> 21:32.543
Enough.

21:32.544 --> 21:34.544
Come on Jacob, okay.

21:34.744 --> 21:37.105
- Come on, you'll be alright.
- Jacob.

21:37.155 --> 21:39.135
It's alright let him go.

21:45.746 --> 21:48.666
Pam, open up.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.356
Where is he?

21:52.357 --> 21:55.616
- Calm down.
- Wes, get down here.

21:55.617 --> 21:58.797
- Hollis, he's asleep.
- What do you think you're doing?

21:58.798 --> 22:03.138
- You think that was my idea?
- CPS just dumped him on me.

22:04.128 --> 22:06.778
And you need to start
getting your shit together.

22:06.779 --> 22:08.809
I can't keep playing
baby sitter for you.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.186
I can take care of my boys.

22:10.187 --> 22:12.775
I'm just taking Wes for
a little while.  That's all.

22:12.830 --> 22:16.770
- I can take care of my kids.
- Really, can you?

22:18.371 --> 22:21.711
Rebecca would be so
heartbroken and you know it.

22:23.121 --> 22:27.612
She loved those boys way too much to see
you abandon them the way you did.

22:28.382 --> 22:30.731
You told them.

22:30.732 --> 22:32.850
That's what this is about.
You told that case worker?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.051
Back up.
Back up Hollis.

22:35.283 --> 22:37.788
I didn't say a damn word.

22:41.984 --> 22:44.934
Just calm down.

23:23.490 --> 23:26.560
- What did they say?
- Go to bed.

23:26.561 --> 23:30.281
- When is he coming back?
- Go to bed Jacob.

24:02.646 --> 24:04.605
Hollis!

24:04.606 --> 24:06.726
I ain't troublin' no one.

24:06.827 --> 24:08.207
Your neighbors are complaining again.

24:08.208 --> 24:10.631
You gotta turn that music down
and go back inside, son.

24:10.667 --> 24:14.007
It's a free country
I can do what I want.

24:14.008 --> 24:15.766
Come on man, don't cause
any more trouble, we don't

24:15.779 --> 24:18.048
wanna bring you in again
if we don't have to.

24:28.990 --> 24:31.249
It's you?

24:31.250 --> 24:33.649
Huh?

24:33.650 --> 24:36.451
Fuckin' ugly coward.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.930
Hey, you got something
to say to me, Harrold.

24:39.931 --> 24:43.441
- You say it to my face.
- Hollis! Hollis!

24:43.442 --> 24:46.251
Hollis, that's enough.

24:46.252 --> 24:50.343
Going to have to sleep this off.
Come on, let's go.

24:50.863 --> 24:53.302
Get your hands off me.

24:53.603 --> 24:56.323
- Come on.
- No.

24:56.324 --> 25:00.274
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me.

25:01.095 --> 25:02.755
I'm going!

25:06.155 --> 25:08.036
I'm going.

25:42.751 --> 25:46.101
My co-worker had it,
sorry about that.

25:50.322 --> 25:51.842
Now.

25:52.352 --> 25:56.783
You know I can't be letting a 10 year old
boy go unsupervised like you've been doing.

25:57.003 --> 26:02.994
And trust me, a 13 year old kid on probation
is not our idea of a good care taker.

26:05.154 --> 26:06.794
Well.

26:08.435 --> 26:12.865
The judge has allowed
you to keep Jacob.

26:13.735 --> 26:16.825
But you gotta go to the court
appointed counselor once a week.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.955
Make every single court date.

26:19.956 --> 26:21.956
Hm.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.247
And stop drinking.

26:29.368 --> 26:33.197
We'll give it a month
and revisit the situation.

26:33.198 --> 26:36.508
You're just lucky judge
Bradley is a big baseball fan.

26:36.509 --> 26:39.579
He said he went to all your games.

26:44.510 --> 26:48.370
Look I know that you and your
family have been through a hard time.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.150
It seems to me that...

26:51.151 --> 26:53.651
you could use a little help.

26:56.612 --> 26:59.560
So you look to me and your
sister-in-law because

26:59.573 --> 27:02.632
we're just trying to help
you out, you understand.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.123
Hollis!

27:19.935 --> 27:22.634
This is just temporary.

27:22.635 --> 27:24.636
You know that.

27:26.256 --> 27:28.906
It's not like last time, okay?

27:33.927 --> 27:36.647
You been practicing your moves?

27:40.768 --> 27:41.678
Hum.

27:45.259 --> 27:47.659
You're better than me.

27:58.451 --> 28:01.040
Alright, come here.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.041
Here we go.

28:05.692 --> 28:07.742
You be good.

28:08.682 --> 28:11.373
- Alright?
- Ok.

28:14.513 --> 28:16.783
I love that.

28:18.584 --> 28:20.784
Go to bed.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.688
Aunt Pam?

28:53.949 --> 28:56.279
Aunt Pam?

29:01.560 --> 29:05.350
- Your okay?
- Can you sit with me until I fall asleep?

29:05.351 --> 29:07.851
Yeah of course.

29:24.673 --> 29:27.063
You want me to read you a story.

29:27.064 --> 29:31.054
Or I could actually make one up.

29:35.205 --> 29:37.695
You can just sit in that chair.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.659
"I wanna come home."

30:09.660 --> 30:13.210
- Turn it down there!
- You turn it down.

30:13.211 --> 30:16.561
- I wanna come home
- Move.

30:28.663 --> 30:31.723
- You there?
- Aha!

30:38.524 --> 30:41.914
You remember when Carmichael won 24 motos?

30:41.915 --> 30:45.085
Like before you were even born?

30:45.885 --> 30:50.245
And like, after he hurt his knee,
he won all 24 again.

30:50.246 --> 30:52.246
Yeah.

30:52.986 --> 30:56.256
He's like an American
hero you know.

30:56.257 --> 30:58.257
I mean who doesn't
respect that guy?

31:00.667 --> 31:03.937
"Bookstore is closing soon."

31:03.938 --> 31:05.937
- I gotta go.
- Wes.

31:06.138 --> 31:07.939
<i>What?</i>

31:07.979 --> 31:11.309
I'm gonna make it right, okay?

31:15.210 --> 31:16.590
Okay.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.800
Who's that?

31:21.801 --> 31:23.901

31:26.161 --> 31:29.442
Alright, kid, come on.

31:35.463 --> 31:38.932
<i>You know Ricky just has to drive,
he wasn't afraid of the work.</i>

31:38.933 --> 31:42.693
<i>He always trained harder than anyone
else, he's a role model for young ones.</i>

31:42.694 --> 31:45.593
<i>He shows them you get out of life
whatever you put into it.</i>

31:45.594 --> 31:48.595
<i>But you can't hide in a motocross
world, that's crazy.</i>

31:48.635 --> 31:50.798
<i>Every time he goes out
there he's thinking about</i>

31:50.811 --> 31:54.485
<i>nothing else but cross that
finish line first.  And he does.</i>

32:12.858 --> 32:14.613
- Go!
- Awesome.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.390
Oh nice little job!

32:29.841 --> 32:32.611

32:40.692 --> 32:42.281

32:42.282 --> 32:45.022
- You alright man.
- Take the helmet off.

32:45.023 --> 32:48.402
- You took that corner way too fast.
- No shit.

32:48.403 --> 32:50.404
Come on get up.

32:52.054 --> 32:54.373
Faster.

32:54.574 --> 32:56.774
I wanna go again.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.144
- Are you sure?
- Yes, fuckin.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.795
I turned too quick.

33:05.136 --> 33:08.765
- So, you talked to Lorne yet.
- Yeah, I talked to her yesterday.

33:08.766 --> 33:11.816
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

33:11.817 --> 33:13.926
- You on date?
- Yeah.

33:13.927 --> 33:16.326
Since when?
- Since yesterday.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.247
Where did you guys go?
- We really didn't go anywhere.

33:19.248 --> 33:22.177
There's your house but
- What do you mean nowhere?

33:22.578 --> 33:24.468
- No where.
- Wait.

33:24.469 --> 33:27.168
So you haven't been on a real
date yet, like your dating.

33:27.169 --> 33:29.288
Yes it's been one day,
how can we go anywhere?

33:29.289 --> 33:32.699
- You're not dating her then.
- Take her to your house.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.079
- Have you gotten anywhere yet.
- Nope.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.721
- I would have done it in the first 20min.
- Shut up man.

33:39.751 --> 33:44.872
- Anyway she invited me to this
kid's party Saturday night
- It's a rich kid's party.

33:46.672 --> 33:50.051
- It's nice, like it?
- Yeah.

33:50.052 --> 33:51.852
Was this 250?

33:51.853 --> 33:56.092
- Yeah.
-How much?
- Way too much. That's how much.

33:56.093 --> 33:57.627
My mom is baking a chocolate
cake tonight, for

33:57.640 --> 33:59.983
Tim's birthday if anyone
wants to come over.

33:59.984 --> 34:03.613
I can't, my parents wanna
have some bullshit big talk.

34:03.614 --> 34:05.434
That sucks.

34:06.035 --> 34:08.594
I thought Tim and your mom broke up.

34:08.594 --> 34:12.806
She took him back, fucking dick,
treats her like crap.

34:14.806 --> 34:17.996
You remember that one time when your
mother kicked me outa the house?

34:17.996 --> 34:22.697
Your mom wouldn't take shit from
no one, she was so fuckin cool.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.367
Look Jacob, I'm sorry man.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.768
Whatever, just go.

34:35.379 --> 34:38.458
Hey, do you hear Bailey's
renovating that bowling alley?

34:38.460 --> 34:41.859
- Yeah?
- Yeah man.

34:41.860 --> 34:45.871
- Saturday night specials, baby.
- We're the worst in the league.

34:46.681 --> 34:50.831
Me, you, Rebecca.

34:50.841 --> 34:53.690
Janey Donovan.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.841
That girl had an ass on her.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.992
Every time she grab that pink little
ball and bowl walk up to that line.

34:58.993 --> 35:01.432
I'm about hurt myself.

35:01.433 --> 35:05.163
I still got that last place
trophy Rebecca made us.

35:05.164 --> 35:07.754
She always said we're the
best to be the last.

35:08.804 --> 35:10.424
Yeah.

35:13.895 --> 35:16.035
She sure did

35:25.867 --> 35:28.257
Mind if say something?

35:32.167 --> 35:35.497
Why don't you sell this place, man?

35:35.498 --> 35:38.368
She'd want you to let it go.

35:40.389 --> 35:44.139
This ain't the dream home she
thought it was gonna be you know.

35:55.951 --> 35:58.660
You owe me a 6-pack.

35:58.661 --> 36:01.991

Hey Jacob!

36:27.916 --> 36:29.846
Wes here?

36:32.476 --> 36:36.837
I don't think it's a good idea
that you all hang out right now.

36:41.758 --> 36:45.687
Look, I'm gonna win a bike
race next month.

36:45.688 --> 36:48.439
You gonna see me at nationals this year.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.518
You know who Ricky Carmichael is?

36:51.519 --> 36:53.518
I don't.

36:53.519 --> 36:55.769
That's really great!

36:55.770 --> 36:59.040
Your mom would be real proud of you.

37:00.481 --> 37:04.401
Look, can I at least come
in hang out with him?

37:07.742 --> 37:11.742
Not today  I'm sorry.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.415
Come on.

37:35.416 --> 37:38.456
Hey Jacob get in here.

37:55.049 --> 37:57.349
What's wrong?

38:00.749 --> 38:05.649
You wanna go get some
ice-cream after the game.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.419
We can celebrate.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.281
Celebrate what?

38:11.971 --> 38:18.002
I got the back deck finished finally.

38:21.092 --> 38:25.353
- Fuck Houston.
- Watch your language.

38:52.797 --> 38:55.636
Don't go in my room.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.907
If you change your mind let me know.

38:58.908 --> 39:00.728
Dad!

39:21.211 --> 39:26.321
My best friend at school
he told me a joke.

39:26.322 --> 39:30.442
Yeah?
What is that?

39:30.443 --> 39:33.912
You got 30 cows and 28 chickens.

39:33.913 --> 39:39.243
- How many didn't?
- How many didn't?

39:39.244 --> 39:41.244
I don't know.

39:43.295 --> 39:48.814
There are 30 cows and 28 chicken.
How many didn't?

39:48.815 --> 39:53.616
Didn't what?

39:56.976 --> 39:59.986
- That's the punch line?
- No.

39:59.987 --> 40:05.077
There are 30 cows and 28 chickens.

40:05.078 --> 40:07.427
I don't know what you're saying.

40:07.428 --> 40:09.987
I wanna know the joke.

40:09.988 --> 40:15.408
There are 30 cows, twenty
'eight' chicken.

40:15.409 --> 40:20.329
There's only 30 cows,
28 chickens, okay.

40:20.330 --> 40:24.218
There are 30 cows, twenty
of them 'ate' chickens.

40:24.219 --> 40:28.855
Ahh!
20 cows ate the chickens.

40:34.452 --> 40:38.442
"I must confess he said that
I found it very difficult to row".

40:38.443 --> 40:41.582
For so long a time,
though I assure you.

40:41.583 --> 40:44.453
I did my best and did not
spare my strength.

40:44.454 --> 40:48.253
I noticed that though the wind
blew strong in my face,

40:48.254 --> 40:51.394
the current continued
to carry us out".

40:54.425 --> 40:59.385
Aunt Pam, you should
probably go to bed.

40:59.386 --> 41:02.686
Yah you're right.

41:04.426 --> 41:08.477
- I love you.
- Love you.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.049
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:30.050 --> 41:32.510
Shhh, get your shoes on.
Let's go.

41:39.142 --> 41:43.042
Wes don't be a pussy, let's go.

41:49.903 --> 41:52.443
He's getting cosy.

41:52.444 --> 41:54.644
Lucky him.

41:56.094 --> 41:58.493
Hey, that could be us
in a few seconds.

41:58.494 --> 42:01.235
So gross.

42:01.705 --> 42:04.665
Katy! Katy?

42:05.515 --> 42:07.626
No shit?

42:21.258 --> 42:24.427
Have you been in that
old bookstore on 12th?

42:24.428 --> 42:27.168
There's like this whole
section on pirates.

42:27.169 --> 42:29.398
And that weird guy Max was there.

42:29.399 --> 42:33.089
He would show me these
old rap records.

42:34.190 --> 42:38.559
She's just trying to buy your love
and your too dumb to realize it?

42:38.560 --> 42:43.600
You'll like aunt Pam, she bought your bike
helmet and took care of us when dad left.

42:43.601 --> 42:46.050
You're just jealous cause
she took me to Six Flags.

42:46.051 --> 42:51.262
As if I could give a shit about
Six Flags, your stupid pirate bookstore.

42:55.413 --> 42:58.433
She's not your mom.

43:06.074 --> 43:07.725
You miss her?

43:11.195 --> 43:14.025
I miss dad.

43:50.161 --> 43:53.901
Did you grab the field trip slip?

44:07.763 --> 44:10.633
Huh, I'm sorry uh.

44:13.514 --> 44:18.155
I'm sorry Mr. Wilson she had

44:21.375 --> 44:25.895
Call us back in the morning.
We'll re-schedule, okay?

44:25.896 --> 44:27.996
- Yes ma'am.
- Okay.

44:34.727 --> 44:37.687
I just saw the case,
it kinda spoke to me.

44:37.688 --> 44:39.807
- Well.
- Said "buy me!".

44:39.808 --> 44:43.028
- Looks nice.
- It's badass cheap.
- It's a good purchase.

44:43.029 --> 44:46.568
Wait Anders.  Are you're talking about that
girl you were with last night, or that gun?

44:46.569 --> 44:48.869
- That gun.
- She was a bargain.

44:48.870 --> 44:53.749
From the bargain bid, she was a little
husky, she was a good deal for him.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.890
Very funny.

44:56.691 --> 44:59.270
You know Danny that new kid
at the barber shop.

44:59.371 --> 45:03.511
Just got himself a Smith & Wesson
model 10.  It's a beaut' man.

45:03.512 --> 45:05.611
- I might be better at this than him.
- Hell yeah.

45:05.612 --> 45:09.892
Hey Capes, watch where you point
that thing, we gotta kid in here.

45:09.993 --> 45:14.083
- Are you talking about Jackie-boy?
- Uh.

45:14.903 --> 45:17.514
Jackie-boy, are you a kid?

45:18.584 --> 45:21.693
- You ever held a gun?
- Why man, I own no guns.

45:21.694 --> 45:23.894
He's gotta learn sometime, right?

45:23.895 --> 45:26.704
- We gotta make a man outa him.
- That's not the way to do it.

45:26.705 --> 45:30.725
- Alright, get outa that armpit boy.
- Come on Jackie-boy, you're up.

45:30.726 --> 45:32.325
Have a seat.

45:32.326 --> 45:34.546
Do it Jackie-boy.
Come on.

45:34.606 --> 45:37.927
It ain't even loaded, man.

45:37.987 --> 45:40.635
Alright Jacob, grab that
with your right hand,

45:40.648 --> 45:42.807
now you cradle the butt right
here with your left hand.

45:42.857 --> 45:45.208
"Cradle the butt".

45:45.258 --> 45:48.917
This is an advice that'll
work all year round now.

45:48.918 --> 45:51.898
You keep this tight like that,
push it tight.

45:51.899 --> 45:55.578
Now when you go in ready to fire
you just drop that in like that, okay?

45:55.579 --> 45:57.879
"Booo", squeeze it don't pull.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.469
That's enough, give it back Jacob.

46:00.470 --> 46:01.719
Dad it's fine.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.200
Come on man, he's already got a record.
- Alright.

46:04.201 --> 46:07.570
- Alright.

46:07.571 --> 46:10.161
- Alright Jacob.

46:10.162 --> 46:13.482
- One last.
- No, I'm good.

46:17.613 --> 46:19.732
These are the precious moments.

46:19.733 --> 46:23.842
- They don't come back.
- These are the precious moments.

46:23.843 --> 46:26.013
You're right.

46:26.014 --> 46:30.534
What, I'm serious

46:35.805 --> 46:38.446
Alright, come on.

46:39.096 --> 46:40.926

46:41.766 --> 46:45.286
Hey, get up, get dressed.
Put your shoes on.

46:45.287 --> 46:48.256
I need you ready in 10 minutes, okay?

46:48.257 --> 46:50.857

48:52.845 --> 48:54.725
What do you mean?

48:54.726 --> 49:00.055
I don't think that's a good idea right now
with everything that's been goin on, okay?

49:00.056 --> 49:03.726
Just because some damn court saying

- Hey, you see that Carmichael move?
- That was awesome.

52:20.296 --> 52:22.935
- Let me see it.
- Chill out.

52:22.936 --> 52:25.156
- He's so fricking fast.
- Stop.

52:25.157 --> 52:29.396
- You fuckin dick.
- Oh shit, Lance.

52:29.397 --> 52:32.597
Shhhhit!

52:32.598 --> 52:35.288
Come on.
- It's over let's go.

52:35.318 --> 52:38.849
- Get off him.
- You got it come on.

52:43.409 --> 52:45.450
You're lucky.

52:46.220 --> 52:50.440
Your friend Lance here
takes full blame.

52:51.721 --> 52:55.780
I don't wanna see you boys
back in this park ever.

52:55.781 --> 53:00.522
This is a public place for little
kids, not a bunch of teenage punks.

53:05.923 --> 53:08.183
Alright, go on.

53:10.133 --> 53:14.093
Nathan, except you get back over
here, and sit down.

53:14.094 --> 53:16.683
Lance you too.

53:16.684 --> 53:19.085
Rest of you get outa here.

53:31.106 --> 53:35.026
Lance's parents are getting a divorce.

53:35.027 --> 53:37.626
That fuckin sucks, man.

53:37.627 --> 53:42.197
Yeah, Charlotte told me Lance's dad
was having an affair with Nathan's mom.

53:42.198 --> 53:43.594
How the hell would Charlotte know?

53:43.595 --> 53:46.830
Her mom ***.
She probably knows everything.

53:47.559 --> 53:50.689
Fuckin hate cops.

53:53.520 --> 53:58.630
- Man, your dad's gonna kick your ass.
- Shut up.

54:08.542 --> 54:11.311
That's not like mom's but.

54:11.312 --> 54:13.313
Hm.

54:19.353 --> 54:21.074
What?

54:22.374 --> 54:25.053
You washed my uniform?

54:25.054 --> 54:27.055
It's on your bed.

54:30.855 --> 54:33.815
Where did you get the shiner?

54:33.816 --> 54:36.106
Some kid at the park.

54:36.116 --> 54:38.496
You hit him back?

54:40.937 --> 54:42.887
Good.

54:46.307 --> 54:48.918
Where did you get the girl make up?

54:50.298 --> 54:52.668
Andrew's sister.

54:55.649 --> 54:57.878
She used to tell us about that...

54:57.879 --> 55:00.180
kid from the Burger Palace.

55:00.860 --> 55:04.820
He got his face bashed in so bad in
Juvie, he couldn't talk for a month.

55:04.950 --> 55:07.470
It's why he's got the weird scar.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.621
Hm.

55:11.751 --> 55:17.292
I saw the kid who got stabbed
and died like two months ago.

55:18.822 --> 55:23.123
Well, I guess it's best you
stay out there then, uh?

55:25.783 --> 55:27.274
Hey.

55:28.474 --> 55:31.004
You gotta do better.

55:40.225 --> 55:44.436
The qualifier for nationals
is in two weeks.

55:49.057 --> 55:50.107
Good.

55:56.068 --> 55:58.907
Hey, we need the video camera

55:58.908 --> 56:03.609
- Yeah Lance, get some clothes on.
- Just open the door?

56:06.739 --> 56:09.140
Hey man, you're grounded?

56:09.690 --> 56:12.289
You come out?

56:12.190 --> 56:14.991
My brother's taking us to the track.

56:17.131 --> 56:20.690
- Hey man, where's your mom?
- Shit, I don't know.

56:20.691 --> 56:25.511
- So you wanna come or...
- I said I don't wanna fucking go,
now take the camera.

56:25.512 --> 56:27.712
Jesus.

57:30.382 --> 57:35.482
Alright, I'm gonna be right
back here to pick you up, okay?

58:25.610 --> 58:28.230
What do you want Pam?

58:28.530 --> 58:31.090
I need to talk to you.

58:31.091 --> 58:33.391
It's important.

58:38.212 --> 58:45.433
So, I got offered a job,
a couple days ago in Houston.

58:48.133 --> 58:53.353
And I've been giving
it a lot of thought.

58:53.354 --> 58:56.654
And I'm gonna take it.

58:57.474 --> 59:00.884
You remember how much we all wanted
to get out of here when we were kids?

59:00.885 --> 59:04.435
And you guys always had Galveston.

59:07.316 --> 59:13.766
So Wes's lawyer told me that
you missed counseling.

59:13.767 --> 59:17.226
<i>So she's advising me that it is...</i>

59:17.227 --> 59:19.367
in Wes's best interest...

59:19.368 --> 59:21.887
that he come with me to Houston.

59:21.888 --> 59:24.848
Get out of my house.

59:26.429 --> 59:28.888
Get out!
Get out!

59:28.889 --> 59:31.179
Wait, Hollis.

59:32.580 --> 59:37.129
<i>Jacob's gonna end up in Juvie and
you know it, and then what?  Wes too?</i>

59:37.130 --> 59:40.490
Next time you come back over
here, you'll be bringing him home.

59:40.491 --> 59:42.590
I just want what's best for him.

59:42.591 --> 59:45.311
Travis left 'cause
you didn't want kids.

59:45.312 --> 59:47.911
You never wanted kids, Pam.

59:47.912 --> 59:50.952
Why the hell are
you tryin' to take mine?

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.785
Dad!

01:00:35.529 --> 01:00:40.550
<i>Hi you've reached Pam...
and Wes.  Leave us a message.</i>

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.209
Hey Wes, this is Jacob.

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.411
Just call me back okay?

01:01:08.138 --> 01:01:09.873
Look at this jackass.

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:13.735
You're gonna win this shit, man,
the cat's in the bag.

01:01:15.483 --> 01:01:18.663
I heard about Robert Ramirez, he put
some kid in the hospital yesterday, dude.

01:01:18.664 --> 01:01:23.668
He wasn't in the hospital but,
I think he's messed up pretty bad.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.544
They took Robbie in handcuffs.
- Shit.

01:01:27.545 --> 01:01:29.537
'You seen it?

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:39.629
Have you seen Wes lately?

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:41.729
Nope.

01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:51.579
You got this, man.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.980
You'll win the whole race.

01:01:59.253 --> 01:02:01.318
I have to.

01:02:12.727 --> 01:02:15.492
- You've seen my belt?
- No.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:16.652
Damn.

01:02:21.865 --> 01:02:24.884
Find that nice tie mom got you?

01:02:24.885 --> 01:02:27.904
Yes, it's right here.

01:02:29.005 --> 01:02:31.805
I don't know how to tie it.

01:02:31.806 --> 01:02:35.246
- She always did for me.
- I know.

01:02:36.147 --> 01:02:38.283
Come here.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.870
Lift up your chin.

01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.871
Here you go.

01:02:57.743 --> 01:02:58.927
Here.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.671
It's good.

01:03:07.032 --> 01:03:09.488
<i>I'm not dragging you in here with me.</i>

01:03:10.576 --> 01:03:13.208
<i>You boys are.</i>

01:03:14.096 --> 01:03:18.857
<i>I'm not threatening you with
anything, I'm trying to keep what.</i>

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:22.593
<i>like you said there are children and
I gotta keep every other weekend.</i>

01:03:25.509 --> 01:03:30.362
- Come on.
- What 'they say? Dad where's Wes?

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.545
Jacob.

01:04:00.467 --> 01:04:02.835
We'll get him back.

01:04:13.948 --> 01:04:15.774
Wes!

01:04:15.775 --> 01:04:18.875
What are you doing here?
- Why you never call me back?

01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:21.725
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:04:21.726 --> 01:04:25.005
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know.

01:04:25.006 --> 01:04:28.195
Look, I'm gonna race next week.

01:04:28.196 --> 01:04:30.195
Alright?

01:04:30.196 --> 01:04:33.469
I'm gonna win for you and dad,
whole town's gonna see it.

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:37.756
- Okay.
- I need you to be there, okay?

01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:39.756
You gotta tell Pam.

01:04:39.757 --> 01:04:41.237
Wes?

01:04:43.562 --> 01:04:45.454
Let me go.

01:05:06.191 --> 01:05:09.431
Hey mom's still at her bridge club,
you wanna come in for a cold one.

01:05:09.432 --> 01:05:12.695
I gotta get back.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.159
Everything's gonna work
out just fine, man.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.559
What 'you worried about.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.543
Yeah.

01:05:22.775 --> 01:05:24.309
Put some clothes on.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.944
You scaring the kids.

01:05:49.073 --> 01:05:52.338
You alright with riding this one?

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:57.065
Well, come on.
Get in.

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:10.035
<i>If you're just pulling
in at the front gate</i>

01:06:10.048 --> 01:06:13.107
<i>you can tune in at 87.

<i>We got race number 3 loading

01:06:24.656 --> 01:06:28.422
<i>Open amateur class for 85cc

<i>Right now race number 3 is on...</i>

Yeah Jacob.

01:07:10.022 --> 01:07:12.015
Jacob wooo.

01:07:24.786 --> 01:07:30.807
The 45 are about to enter the first
turn here at cow-boy Badlands MX park.

01:07:34.827 --> 01:07:39.703
<i>Again the top 12 qualify for

01:07:44.296 --> 01:07:48.480
<i>Jacob Wilson now starts to put up a
little bit of pressure running up front.</i>

01:07:52.488 --> 01:07:54.608

<i>Couple of laps in, here we go with

01:08:05.817 --> 01:08:06.600
Come on.

01:08:06.601 --> 01:08:09.321
<i>All three frontrunners here...</i>

01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:15.848
<i>And Jacob Wilson now
takes over the lead.</i>

01:08:15.649 --> 01:08:16.805
Good, good, good.

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:19.968
<i>We gonna have Gary Owens
on our thrilling...</i>

01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:29.314
<i>Owen makes the pass,
puts Jacob Wilson over the berm.</i>

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.091
Is Wes here?

01:09:49.206 --> 01:09:50.413
No.

01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:57.928
Come on.

01:09:59.689 --> 01:10:01.865
Hey, you were great.

01:10:12.973 --> 01:10:15.222
Okay.

01:10:15.886 --> 01:10:18.215
Anything else I can get you boys?

01:10:18.216 --> 01:10:20.998
- I think that's it, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.996
- And a coke.
- Yeah sure.

01:10:25.802 --> 01:10:26.906
Here you go.

01:10:29.002 --> 01:10:34.284
Your mom would be real proud of you.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.902
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?

01:10:43.575 --> 01:10:46.272
Close your mouth when you eat.

01:10:48.873 --> 01:10:52.019
- Real nice.
- Hyder.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.846
So?

01:10:55.847 --> 01:10:59.780
- How is school boys?
- I hate school.

01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:01.779
It's fine.

01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:05.870
This whole thing's a joke.

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:09.170
Dad of the fucking year over here.

01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:13.352
- Not here.
- Why not uh?  Everyone
knows CPS took your kid.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:15.352
Whole town knows.

01:11:15.353 --> 01:11:18.143
- Shut your mouth now.
- They don't know about Galveston.

01:11:18.144 --> 01:11:21.304
- That's enough.
- He fucking left us.

01:11:21.305 --> 01:11:23.765
- Stop.
- Don't tell me what to do.

01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:27.966
It wasn't my responsibility
to take care of everything.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:31.598
Take care of Wes while
you boozed up down there.

01:11:31.599 --> 01:11:33.600
Alright, come on.

01:11:35.056 --> 01:11:39.420
3 weeks dad, 3 whole
weeks you were gone.

01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:43.501
Admit it, you wanna
drink yourself to death.

01:11:43.502 --> 01:11:46.752
Cause when Duncan found you, you were
gonna leave us for good, weren't you?

01:11:46.753 --> 01:11:50.323
- Let's go.
- We're not leaving.

01:11:50.324 --> 01:11:53.795
- Enough now.
- Now what are we supposed to do uh?

01:11:53.796 --> 01:11:56.746
How are we supposed to get him back?

01:11:56.747 --> 01:12:01.167
This is all your fault.
This whole thing is your fault.

01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:04.818
You wanna play that game?
You really wanna go there?

01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:08.058
Take a hard look at yourself, son.

01:12:08.059 --> 01:12:10.050
Come on, let's go.

01:12:10.051 --> 01:12:13.972
Get your hands off me.

01:12:13.973 --> 01:12:16.813
Don't touch me.

01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:32.065
Fuck all of you.

01:12:37.932 --> 01:12:39.901
Come on.

01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:46.343
I left money on the table.
I'm sorry about this.

01:14:21.727 --> 01:14:24.503
One of these .

01:14:42.832 --> 01:14:45.885
Get another one.

01:14:50.392 --> 01:14:51.408
Get it.

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.446
Nice one.

01:14:59.258 --> 01:15:01.811
- Let me see that thing.
- No, you'll burn yourself.

01:15:01.812 --> 01:15:03.808
- Come on, give me
- Stop.

01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:09.799
- Hyder, stop.
- Would you give me the friggin lighter.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.970
Jacob let me do it.

01:15:13.371 --> 01:15:16.302
Don't hit anyone, Hyder.

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:19.657
Just shut up.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.305
The retard's gonna hit his own face.

01:15:30.306 --> 01:15:34.349
- Shut up you asshole.
- Holy shit no more house arrest.

01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:38.743
Gimme the bat, let me
show you how it is done.

01:15:38.744 --> 01:15:40.939
Alright.

01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:46.494
Hold that for me.

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:47.738
Fuck you.

01:15:48.818 --> 01:15:52.371
- Stop being such a little bitch.
- Lance stop motherfucker, quit it.

I was supposed to protect him.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.989
She's taking him to Houston.

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:17.536

01:17:46.321 --> 01:17:48.329
Alright.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.902
I saw your probation report
signed on your bed.

01:17:51.903 --> 01:17:56.819
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back
at Barker sooner than you thought.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.815
I'm real proud of you.

01:18:00.794 --> 01:18:03.029
You hear what I said?

01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:05.027
Yeah.

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:14.611

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:19.012
I don't know, you just...

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.061
You look like her sitting there.

01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:30.366
We made a great team didn't we?

01:18:30.367 --> 01:18:32.366
The four of us.

01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:16.509
Hey Wes, get up.

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:17.855

01:19:23.688 --> 01:19:25.683

01:19:26.546 --> 01:19:28.330
We're leaving.

01:19:29.291 --> 01:19:30.779

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.004
Hurry up, get your shoes.

01:19:38.237 --> 01:19:40.442

I can't go anywhere.

01:20:03.346 --> 01:20:06.405
It's not a choice, Wes.

01:20:06.406 --> 01:20:08.407

01:20:11.952 --> 01:20:14.469

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.041
Go, go.

01:21:41.413 --> 01:21:43.199
She's asleep.

01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:48.248

01:22:47.559 --> 01:22:50.480
You think it's okay what you did?

01:22:50.481 --> 01:22:53.253

01:22:54.129 --> 01:22:55.313
Lance!

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:58.902
You're a fucking bitch,

- Let it go.
- You're breaking up a family.

01:23:06.508 --> 01:23:08.702
You have a clue how fucked up that is?

01:23:08.703 --> 01:23:10.194
Do you?

01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:13.686
Why don't I shoot you now, huh?

01:23:13.687 --> 01:23:17.605
- Lance stop! We're fucking leaving.

01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:20.299

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.920
- You fucking bitch.
- Lance, hey.

01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:25.823
Calm down.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.091
Get off me.

01:23:29.192 --> 01:23:32.533

01:23:32.534 --> 01:23:35.115

01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:47.814
Shit!

01:23:49.799 --> 01:23:52.953
Get up, cops are coming.

01:23:57.461 --> 01:23:59.162
Let's go.

01:24:13.003 --> 01:24:15.967
What's going on?

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:20.057
Wow, hey, say that again?

01:24:33.045 --> 01:24:34.310
Pam!

01:24:50.783 --> 01:24:53.796
- What the hell happened?
- It wasn't Jacob's fault.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:58.560
He was trying to protect
everybody, and Lance was just...

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:02.712
I got the boy off to the town
hospital, he's gonna be fine.

01:25:02.713 --> 01:25:06.016
You have any idea where
these boys might have gone?

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:07.761
I don't know.

01:25:08.761 --> 01:25:11.514
The detectives out there want you
both to come at the station.

01:25:11.515 --> 01:25:13.606
Are you kidding me Walter?

01:25:13.607 --> 01:25:16.491
My kids are out there, scared and alone.
I'm not going to any of your dam station.

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:20.557
- When they find them,
they're bringing them in.
- They're fucking kids.

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:28.388
- What's he doing?
- He's just staring at me.

01:25:30.648 --> 01:25:32.072
Let's go.

01:25:42.152 --> 01:25:45.149
Hyder!  Hey, stop!

01:25:49.438 --> 01:25:50.558
Stop.

01:25:51.238 --> 01:25:53.151
Hey, Hyder.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.196
Stop, where are Wes and Jacob?

01:25:56.197 --> 01:25:58.190
Uh? Where are they?

01:25:58.191 --> 01:26:00.892
The beach.

01:26:24.189 --> 01:26:25.209
Hey, how long?

01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:29.976
Has to be about at least another 30
minutes before it gets back over here.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.092
Okay, we'll be back.

01:26:33.593 --> 01:26:34.439
Let's go.

01:26:43.243 --> 01:26:45.905
You remember when mom used
to take us here to wait?

01:26:52.523 --> 01:26:55.889
We start over in Galveston.

01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:58.540
Just like she wanted.

01:27:03.359 --> 01:27:04.974
It will be like .

01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:06.973
The Swiss family Wilson or something.

01:27:14.018 --> 01:27:16.570
I'll take care of you, okay?

01:27:22.509 --> 01:27:24.069
Come here.

01:27:47.461 --> 01:27:50.373
Walk in on the left boys.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.445
Are you OK?

01:28:15.589 --> 01:28:16.703

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:25.628
- Hey, you see 2 boys get on

01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:36.757

- Yes, they're on there somewhere.

01:28:39.774 --> 01:28:41.270
Wes.

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:44.376
Jacob.

01:28:45.647 --> 01:28:46.864
Wes.

01:28:48.752 --> 01:28:50.242
Jacob.

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:58.076
Wes.

01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:06.052
You alright?

01:29:06.053 --> 01:29:08.566
Uh? Are you OK?

01:29:10.087 --> 01:29:11.864
I got you.

01:29:13.425 --> 01:29:15.081
I got you.

01:29:20.979 --> 01:29:22.171
Are you OK?

01:29:27.694 --> 01:29:30.173
Come here.

01:29:37.064 --> 01:29:39.818
It's okay, shhh.
- I'm sorry.

01:29:42.258 --> 01:29:46.415
I screwed up, me.

01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:49.733
I never should have left you boys.

01:30:36.795 --> 01:30:39.269
Look at me.

01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:43.902
Look at me.

01:30:48.215 --> 01:30:50.720
I love you more than anything.

01:30:51.408 --> 01:30:53.970
You understand me?

01:30:59.315 --> 01:31:05.932
Everything is going to be okay.

01:31:44.043 --> 01:31:49.121
Wes, let me out I feel sick.

01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:05.575
You're okay?

01:32:09.052 --> 01:32:11.894
Stay with dad, okay?

Stay with him, understand?
