WEBVTT

02:08.629 --> 02:13.874
The day was hot, but the night turns chilly fast,
it seems, for the time of year.

02:14.010 --> 02:19.130
Day after tomorrow, we shall be in Capua
and you will sleep in a good warm house.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.472
Though goatskin has its virtues.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.137
Here we are, refugees in our own land.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.479
We are not refugees.
We are manoeuvring.

02:28.607 --> 02:31.644
As you say, here we are manoeuvring,

02:31.777 --> 02:34.769
while the tyrant sits in Rome.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.898
Yes, in my tent,
I sleep sound and deep as a child.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.580
— Though perhaps not tonight.
— I'm sorry it bothers you.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.744
He'll be finished soon enough.

02:47.877 --> 02:50.414
Quintus has a knack for this kind of thing.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.377
Well, I hope so.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.044
Your son Quintus,
I did not know he was with us.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.714
Arrived this morning from Brindisi.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.011
That's better.

03:05.144 --> 03:08.227
Screaming makes poor sauce, I find.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.438
Quintus has his faults,

03:10.566 --> 03:13.729
but he is loyal and fearless.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.477
A father cannot ask more.

03:16.614 --> 03:20.027
I've never heard nor thought othenNise.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.401
The dog confessed at last.

03:23.537 --> 03:28.281
— Torn up good and red.
— Blood on your face. Wash yourself.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.752
Well, where is Durio? Where is the gold?

03:34.632 --> 03:37.715
He killed Durio as you suspected.

03:37.843 --> 03:41.711
And they took the gold north
on the Via Flaminia,

03:41.847 --> 03:44.429
ran slap into Caesar's scouts.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.594
Pair of Romans, 20 head of Ubian.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.683
Too many for our boys.

03:48.813 --> 03:53.432
They ran, the filth that they are.
Left the gold to the scouts.

03:53.567 --> 03:58.607
Can't be so. I've heard from Rome
this last hour. Caesar has not got the gold.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.778
My man Volpe always gets to truth, Father.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.777
If Caesar does not have it,
his scouts must have kept it.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.949
— Go find these scouts.
- I will.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.947
Now!

04:14.547 --> 04:16.583
You see, the tide turns already.

04:16.715 --> 04:22.130
Without the gold, Caesar will find Rome
a little harder to subdue.

04:22.263 --> 04:26.427
Without the gold,
we're not very well placed, either.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.892
Without gold, he will have to use violence.

04:30.062 --> 04:35.932
Once he starts spilling blood, the people
will turn on him with a vengeance.

04:36.068 --> 04:40.107
Without the people, he has nothing.

04:50.332 --> 04:55.747
"Martial law is in effect
for the safety of all citizens.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.293
"Groups of more than three men

04:59.425 --> 05:02.667
"shall not congregate in public spaces.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.759
"A curfew is in effect.

05:04.889 --> 05:08.256
"Any person found on the street after dark

05:08.392 --> 05:11.225
"will be subject to summary judgment.

05:11.353 --> 05:15.596
"Long live General Gaius Julius Caesar,

05:15.733 --> 05:19.225
"saviour of our Republic."

05:24.867 --> 05:26.949
Halt!

06:11.455 --> 06:13.741
Name yourself, citizen.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.742
Gaius of the Julii, called Caesar.

06:17.878 --> 06:22.417
- Speak, then.
— l humbly ask that auguries be taken

06:22.550 --> 06:26.884
that Rome might know
that the gods favour my actions.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.508
You've entered the city under arms.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.849
I must warn you, that seldom augurs well.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.891
The gods know my intentions are peaceful.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.435
The people must know it also.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.399
So be it.

06:47.241 --> 06:52.452
Auguries will be taken
on the first clean morning.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.663
Let the birds fly where they may.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.258
— How be, paisan?
— Miserable.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.259
Slave of a rebel.

07:17.396 --> 07:21.685
- A successful rebel, at least.
— The jury's still out. And you, my child?

07:21.817 --> 07:26.060
For true misery, try bondage
to a bloody-minded woman.

07:28.907 --> 07:33.651
This dinner tonight, Caesar asks, no shellfish.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.903
Here is a guest list.

07:39.835 --> 07:43.498
I hope your lady is aware
of the honour done to her.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.747
She's very aware.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.839
Caesar's hostess is first woman of the city,
in effect.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.929
— Excepting Caesar's wife.
— Calpurnia?

07:54.058 --> 07:58.893
Caesar requires that she's still
and handsome and dignified and no more.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.684
She is a species of statue.

08:07.363 --> 08:10.196
A very fancy list of people.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.361
Every aristo and optimate left in the city.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.698
He's not planning on killing them, is he?

08:18.499 --> 08:20.285
I shouldn't think so.

08:22.086 --> 08:25.419
My mistress doesn't like surprises.

08:25.547 --> 08:29.586
Servilia. Why invite her?

08:30.844 --> 08:35.804
Can there still be something between them?
A raddled old sandal like her? Surely not.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.549
Some juice in her yet.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.178
I'll not let that woman
get between me and Caesar.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.974
Why is Servilia invited to the party?

08:48.404 --> 08:51.737
Servilia of the Junii, why is she invited?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.197
On account of her son, obviously.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.027
For this, you wake me?

08:58.163 --> 09:02.827
Of course. He needs to keep Brutus
as his symbolic friend.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.920
That's all. It would look ill with the people
if Brutus were his enemy.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.881
There's no love there. It's just politics.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.547
Dear gods, woman, would you let me sleep?

09:38.662 --> 09:42.905
- The goat's testicles, domina.
— Not for me, fool, for Octavian.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.832
Fetch Demeter.
Eat them while they're warm, my dear.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.547
— It puts oak in your penis.
- I'd rather not.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.382
Nonsense, you must.

09:54.511 --> 09:58.299
You've been developing
a distinctly feminine anima. I do not like it.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.798
I am only a boy. It is entirely natural...

10:00.934 --> 10:04.472
When my mother's father was your age,
there was not a slave girl safe.

10:04.605 --> 10:08.393
The men of the Julii are masculine men.
Now do as I say and eat them.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.983
- I will not.
— You'll not leave this room until you do.

10:12.905 --> 10:16.489
Demeter, the banquet this evening,
no shellfish.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.608
And be sure the lampreys are not overcooked.

10:18.744 --> 10:21.736
Boil them long enough to kill them, no more.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.451
I'm waiting.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.590
That's my brave boy.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.721
Brother.

10:52.236 --> 10:55.979
— Did Mother have Glabius killed?
- Of course not.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.030
— You're sure?
— I cannot prove a negative,

10:59.159 --> 11:02.993
— but I'm sure as can be.
— You swear on Jupiter's stone?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.618
I swear on Jupiter's stone.

11:09.837 --> 11:13.000
If she did, if she did kill him,

11:14.883 --> 11:18.967
by the Furies, l'll open her throat with my teeth.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.780
ln Narbo, I could buy ten feasts for this.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.077
Narbo isn't full of corpses and soldiers,

12:31.209 --> 12:34.701
and decent people too scared
to come out of their houses.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.703
No time to throw a do.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.674
I cannot start a business
without a feast, can I?

12:40.802 --> 12:44.169
Today is auspicious, and it's perfectly safe.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.093
I remember when Sulla had soldiers in the city.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.433
— Blood, you could paint houses with it.
— Caesar's not Sulla.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.601
He's declared martial law,
not to spill blood, but to keep the peace.

12:54.733 --> 12:59.193
We'll see, won't we? | invoke Ceres
and Bacchus, you'll not be dissatisfied.

12:59.321 --> 13:03.360
You find me a pig,
and I'll make you a feast, in Hades, if need be.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.450
- And charge according.
— Musa, the oilman's wife,

13:06.578 --> 13:09.741
served whelks instead of oysters
at her womb funeral.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.866
Nobody would let her forget it.
Laughed at in the street.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.465
Divine Janus, we offer this feast to you

13:30.394 --> 13:34.262
and humbly beg that you will be gracious
and merciful to me and my house,

13:34.398 --> 13:38.892
and you will smile upon
this new business venture I begin today.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.779
Lucius Vorenus, his honour
Mark Antony orders your presence.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.240
- Now?
— Of course not. Next year.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.243
My dear comrade.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.209
Barely know you without
a bloody sword in your hand.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.623
Off with you now, Cato.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.831
Amusing...

14:03.844 --> 14:06.335
— Cato.
— As you say.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.259
Of course, you don't all find it amusing.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.724
So...

14:12.853 --> 14:15.390
how is civilian life treating you, huh?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.184
Well enough so far, sir.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.352
You know, of course,

14:20.485 --> 14:23.227
I could have you nailed to a cross
for desertion.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.571
I am no deserter. My time was served.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.784
l abided my sacrament. It is you that...

14:31.538 --> 14:34.496
It is I that what?

14:34.624 --> 14:37.411
Over the Rubicon,
Romans are citizens, not soldiers.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.082
— I could not legally do other than I did.
— Foolish.

14:41.214 --> 14:45.958
— Like a priest blinded by a cowl.
- Since the founding of Rome...

14:46.094 --> 14:49.461
Please, spare me the founding, Vorenus.

14:49.598 --> 14:53.716
Things change. Life is water, not stone.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.343
Then I suppose I will drown.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.098
Do you not see that
your precious Republic has long since died?

15:00.233 --> 15:04.146
Do you not see that Caesar
is trying to save Rome from ruin?

15:04.279 --> 15:06.361
I do not see that.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.906
Enough.

15:11.995 --> 15:16.329
And what wretched trade is it
you intend to follow, then?

15:16.458 --> 15:20.167
Imported goods from Gaul.
Slaves, truffles, wine. That sort of thing.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.660
A grocer?

15:22.756 --> 15:27.170
An honest fighting man
like yourself counting cartons,

15:27.302 --> 15:29.668
scribbling accounts?

15:29.805 --> 15:32.968
— You will swift go mad.
— That may be.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.806
I need you, Vorenus.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.100
Caesar needs you.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.817
There is no better man in the legion,
none more respected by the men.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.278
- We have hard fighting ahead.
— Hard fighting against Romans.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.658
Blood is blood.

15:50.784 --> 15:55.574
Would you really have the 13th
fasten their crest without you?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.165
You come back to the legion,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.706
you shall be inducted
into the evocati as a prefect.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.300
Of the first grade, with a signing bonus.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.510
Say...

16:12.639 --> 16:14.721
10,000 sesterces.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.846
I chose this path. I will follow where it leads.

16:25.819 --> 16:29.778
You grieve me, Vorenus.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.988
You grieve me deeply.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.991
Go on. Off with you.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.704
Good day, citizen.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.323
Vorenus...

16:44.171 --> 16:46.833
Next time | see you, I may not be so kind.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.223
What does it say?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.065
It's not certain,

17:11.198 --> 17:13.439
but I'd say your secret's safe.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.857
Not certain?

17:15.994 --> 17:19.532
— The signs are mixed.
— What good is that?

17:21.499 --> 17:25.617
Tell me what it is you're hiding
and I can be more precise.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.664
There's a child involved.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.252
A male child?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.424
The baby.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.975
— Never mind. Best leave it.
- As you please.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.599
If it's any help, it does say

17:48.735 --> 17:51.568
your husband is going to be rich.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.074
Rich as Croesus.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.073
Well, that's something, isn't it?

18:01.957 --> 18:03.663
Thank you.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.718
Good. Done.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.641
Water.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.450
What did I look like eight years ago?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.878
Just the same.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.544
Eight years

18:54.676 --> 18:56.667
of leathery Gallic trollops.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.510
When did he last see a real lady?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.801
And such a beautiful one?

19:14.195 --> 19:17.153
— Flowers.
— ln bloom?

19:26.750 --> 19:29.958
50,000 to each of the magistrate's clerks.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.872
So much?

19:32.005 --> 19:35.463
| wish to buy their allegiance outright,
not lease it.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.708
Have them sign for the money.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.881
And how much for the sub—praetors?

19:41.014 --> 19:45.758
Nil. When they hear how much
the clerks got, they'll come begging.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.931
And leave us penniless
without means to run the city.

19:49.064 --> 19:52.056
We must kill some rich men
and take their money very soon,

19:52.192 --> 19:56.652
else the well will run dry very soon.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.897
I plan on killing no one
unless absolutely necessary.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.069
A fine, noble strategy,

20:02.202 --> 20:04.238
an element of surprise, no doubt.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.657
Later, you may nag me.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.209
I believe this is appropriate.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.926
Exactly right, my dear.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.547
Regal, but not excessively so.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.265
Fine start to the business, if nobody comes.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.556
Don't worry. They will come.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.523
Maybe I should have waited as you said.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.738
They will come.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.118
And mind now, when they do come,

20:47.247 --> 20:50.114
try to smile occasionally.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.332
And don't bark at them.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.418
- Who's this?
— Erastes Fulmen.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.209
Remember? Our guest of honour.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.457
Building trades, fire insurance, olives.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.254
Lucius Vorenus.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.134
Niobe.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.976
Thank you for coming, honest neighbour.
It can't be easy on such a day.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.436
What's a few soldiers?

21:13.565 --> 21:15.146
Wife, Phyllis.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.604
- Please.
— Sit down and take a cup of wine.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.649
lwill. Thirsty road?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.572
Sister.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.491
- All right?
— All's right. Don't worry.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.834
- Thank you.
— This can't be little Lyde.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.171
— Surely not. Long time...
— Salve, Lucius.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.335
— This is my husband, Evander Pulchio.
- Welcome.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.587
— Honoured.
— Thank you for the pig.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.930
With all the shops shut, we had no meat.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.140
Happy to be of service.

22:27.138 --> 22:31.598
— Thank you so much for inviting me.
- My pleasure, Servilia.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.591
I insisted you come.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.012
Whatever misfortune befalls you,

22:37.148 --> 22:38.888
we're still friends.

22:49.911 --> 22:55.827
She has a good cosmetics slave, l'll grant you.
But a lover for Caesar? Absurd.

23:12.767 --> 23:16.225
Make way for the proconsul
Gaius Julius Caesar,

23:16.813 --> 23:21.432
Son of Venus,
lmperator of the Gallic Legions.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.105
Stand aside and open up.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.412
Please, you mock me.
It's only your Uncle Gaius. Lift your heads.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.415
All of you, lift your heads.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.301
My dear niece.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.390
Revered uncle,

23:56.519 --> 23:59.261
welcome home.

24:19.751 --> 24:22.458
Servilia of the Junii, a pleasant honour it is.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.874
Delightful.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.963
Your pleasure is mine.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.926
I am very sorry your son is not here with you.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.215
I'm sorry also.

24:37.352 --> 24:40.264
I hope you will forgive his absence.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.975
He is ever your friend.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.609
I understand completely.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.359
Please send Brutus my best regards

24:52.492 --> 24:57.156
and assure him he will never have reason
to regret our friendship.

24:57.872 --> 25:00.204
Nor will any of you,

25:00.333 --> 25:05.953
regardless of where your allegiances
may have lain in the past.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.218
— Any weapons?
— None, sir.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.137
— Where are you coming from?
- From Aternum, dominus.

25:20.269 --> 25:23.477
- In what trade?
— Corpse collectors, bone grinders.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.973
- Dead business in general.
— You've come to the right place, then.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.896
What people are they?

25:29.028 --> 25:32.941
Scythians, chief.
They don't speak our language.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.030
On your way, then.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.654
Go on! Please let me in!

25:44.293 --> 25:45.669
You!

25:45.795 --> 25:48.582
Tell your brutes
to stay away from decent women.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.797
I'll do that.

25:54.846 --> 25:58.509
Fine bit of plunder and rapine
you made off them bloody Gauls, I bet.

25:58.641 --> 25:59.926
I'll not complain.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.176
Handy to have cash
in these uncertain times.

26:03.312 --> 26:07.976
A man can't flee with his house and fields
if he's chosen the wrong side.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.067
— True.
— Who do you reckon will come out on top?

26:11.195 --> 26:13.151
It's hard to say.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.943
You'll be hoping it'll be your man though, eh?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.158
If you mean Caesar,
he's not my man any more.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.575
So, your spoils,

26:24.375 --> 26:26.616
you'll be lending the proceeds, I expect.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.209
I won't.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.420
I am buying back this insula
so I'll not have spare cash.

26:31.549 --> 26:35.133
I plan to take over the trading space
for an import business.

26:35.261 --> 26:39.254
— Slaves, mostly.
— Slaves?

26:40.433 --> 26:44.267
Well, listen, l have friends,

26:44.395 --> 26:46.431
bona friends.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.769
If you want any help, you come to me?

26:52.445 --> 26:55.027
More wine here, sweetie.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.983
There are even those unwise men

27:01.120 --> 27:04.487
who say that a white bird
in the southern quadrant

27:04.624 --> 27:07.081
is neither indicant nor negation!

27:08.127 --> 27:11.665
Such are the barbarous
innovations of our day.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.837
Barbarous. We might as well be Syrian.

27:15.968 --> 27:20.883
- Point to pommel, I agree.
— Syrians, indeed. Scythians, even.

27:21.015 --> 27:25.099
As Chief Augur,
l'm gratified to hear you say so.

27:25.228 --> 27:30.518
It was heard you are a man of modish opinion.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.356
That's pure scandal.

27:32.485 --> 27:36.228
I believe that religion
is the province of our worthy priests.

27:36.364 --> 27:39.948
Mere soldiers like myself best not interfere.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.782
That's very gratifying.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.993
Octavian, don't sit there like a prole.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.954
- Say something witty.
— l have nothing such to say.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.291
You know I cannot talk small, Mother.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.455
You, then. Some poetry.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.170
She can rattle off pages of the stuff.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.761
"Easy it is to go down into Hell

28:01.889 --> 28:04.380
"The gates of death are ever open.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.850
"To climb back out again, that's the difficulty."

28:13.442 --> 28:16.775
It's a touch dark, my love, but never mind.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.646
She lost her husband, you know.

28:45.933 --> 28:49.471
Best get your sister gone.
I told you it was a mistake to let her come.

28:49.604 --> 28:52.937
I had to let her come.
It would look odd if she wasn't here.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.728
Speak to Evander, will you?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.896
Butcher man, time to take your wife home.

29:02.033 --> 29:05.571
— She doesn't want to go.
— Best make her go then, eh?

29:10.917 --> 29:12.657
— Time to go.
- Not yet.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.330
— I like it here.
- Time to go.

29:15.463 --> 29:18.455
— Let me go, my love.
— Lyde, please.

29:18.591 --> 29:22.800
Let me go or I'll tell our brave soldier
such a good tale.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.511
Kill us all? Is that what you want?

29:27.350 --> 29:30.968
I love you. Why don't you love me?

29:32.104 --> 29:35.938
I'm sorry.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.811
— Lyde, please.
— I'm your wife.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.484
We had an agreement!
You vowed to Persephone.

29:43.616 --> 29:47.074
— You vowed you would hold your peace!
— Have I not held my peace?

29:47.203 --> 29:51.822
— If my husband...
— Your husband? Your husband is a blind fool!

29:51.958 --> 29:54.700
Do you hear me? He's a blind fool!

29:58.005 --> 30:00.121
Get off me!

30:02.677 --> 30:04.963
Get off me!

30:17.108 --> 30:19.144
Wife?

30:22.655 --> 30:24.987
Caecilia.

30:29.829 --> 30:33.287
Tell me, how is Caecilia?

30:34.709 --> 30:37.746
— She's healthy, I thank you.
— Good.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.496
I recall, I forgot her last birthday.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.790
- Her birthday?
— Remiss of me.

30:44.927 --> 30:48.545
Perhaps she would forgive my rudeness
were I to send her a gift.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.343
Really, that's not necessary.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.807
Hard to find the right gift for a woman.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.723
What one loves, another scorns.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.222
Perhaps she would accept some money.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.098
There's an idea.

31:01.861 --> 31:05.479
100,000 sesterces, say?

31:05.614 --> 31:07.866
That's very kind of you.

31:07.992 --> 31:12.235
I'm afraid my wife is
a woman of expensive tastes.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.238
— The best women often are.
— 150,000.

31:15.374 --> 31:19.834
She would dress her slaves in silk
if I would let her.

31:19.962 --> 31:24.547
She eats oysters for breakfast...daily.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.051
She should be most careful.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.922
People often choke on oysters.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.424
200,000.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.803
That is a very generous,
and I may say, appropriate gift.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.978
She would be under great obligation to you.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.192
To think well of me is her only obligation.

31:45.321 --> 31:48.654
She's always thought well of you.

31:48.783 --> 31:53.197
It is not unethical she continue to do so.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.283
We understand each other.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.625
Make a note of it.

32:04.757 --> 32:08.124
200 to the Chief Augur.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.967
Thinks he's Midas, the Icon.

32:11.472 --> 32:14.635
— Go past the cloth works.
- Thank you very much.

32:21.190 --> 32:26.480
We'll go to the priests of Janus tomorrow
and have the day absolved. lt's costly, but...

32:26.612 --> 32:31.902
An omen is an omen. And this is as bad as
they come. No point throwing money at it.

32:33.369 --> 32:36.486
Your sister and her husband
can never come here again.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.113
— As you say.
— Must not bend.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.709
Salve, pleb.

32:45.381 --> 32:46.962
Centurion Lucius Vorenus?

32:47.800 --> 32:51.384
- Who asks?
— His honour Quintus Pompey.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.503
You best have reason for this insult.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.847
Tell me where the gold is,
and quick about it, dog.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.012
What gold? Speak sense.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.933
— Sense enough?
- Not near.

33:04.066 --> 33:07.979
— | ask again, what gold?
- Stubborn, is he?

33:10.573 --> 33:14.782
This trollop, we can assume, is your wife.

33:16.537 --> 33:18.198
Hold her.

33:21.250 --> 33:24.413
I cannot speak what I do not know.
I do not know of any gold.

33:24.545 --> 33:29.790
You know very well I seek the treasury gold
you took from my father's men.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.883
I took no gold from any man.
You are misinformed.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.094
Misinformed.

33:36.182 --> 33:39.345
You are not chief of scouts, 13th legion?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.889
— l was.
— And last week,

33:43.022 --> 33:45.855
did you not stop a grain wagon
on the Via Flaminia?

33:45.983 --> 33:48.224
We did.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.817
Driven by soldiers disguised.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.107
We chased the soldiers and left the wagon.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.199
— You never thought to look inside?
— There was no time. We had orders.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.532
Your wagon is still there, for all I know.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.746
Lies. Cut her.

34:05.669 --> 34:09.787
- Come on, give it to me!
— Boys, a clamour for my beloved friend Lucius.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.218
Why so glum and gloomy?

34:24.897 --> 34:27.764
— Who's this, then?
— His noble honour Quintus Pompey,

34:27.900 --> 34:31.233
commander of Tyrrhenian fleet,
Neptune's scourge.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.197
Neptune's scourge.

34:34.323 --> 34:36.735
Looking for a wagon of treasury gold.

34:37.910 --> 34:39.866
Treasury gold?

34:41.330 --> 34:43.070
How exciting!

34:43.916 --> 34:46.202
Do not test my patience, peasant.

34:46.919 --> 34:49.911
You be off now, short—arse.
Take these scum with you.

35:07.147 --> 35:11.311
The way I see it, we put little Quintus here
in the Tiber right off,

35:11.443 --> 35:15.311
get us a wagon,
sneak out to where the gold's buried.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.234
Dig it up, ride like
Zephyrus for the coast,

35:18.367 --> 35:21.734
— and get the first tide to Spain.
- I'm trying to think.

35:21.870 --> 35:25.078
— What was wrong with that?
— What's wrong?

35:25.207 --> 35:27.619
Even if it were not a monstrous sin

35:27.751 --> 35:30.914
— to steal sacred property of Rome...
- I wasn't to know, was I?

35:31.046 --> 35:34.129
..you then ride through the streets on a litter,

35:34.258 --> 35:39.173
shouting and singing
and broadcasting your theft to all and sundry.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.672
By sunrise, all of Rome
will know what you did and where you are.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.924
Here, in my house.

35:48.022 --> 35:50.229
So what's to be done, then?

35:50.899 --> 35:52.639
You will have to give it back.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.516
If you go to Caesar now,

35:54.653 --> 35:58.145
bring him Pompey's son
as a sweetener, he might show mercy.

35:58.282 --> 36:02.867
— Give it back? I don't think so.
— That's not advice. That's an order.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.202
Here's me come to share a god—sent gift...

36:05.331 --> 36:07.037
An order!

36:07.166 --> 36:09.532
Damn you. My home was invaded

36:09.668 --> 36:12.956
and my wife near killed on your account.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.462
All right.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.554
— But you'll come with me?
- This is your mess.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.423
You get yourself out of it.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.519
Fine, then.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.183
I'll be off, then.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.147
Good luck to you, sir.

36:59.343 --> 37:01.800
Forgive me. I will try to return swiftly.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.179
Excuse me, my dear.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.867
Pullo, you scoundrel.

37:29.123 --> 37:31.489
— What have you done now?

37:32.084 --> 37:35.747
Your honour, Lucius Vorenus
said I should come to you and...

37:35.879 --> 37:38.621
Easy, soldier. Who is this?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.839
Quintus, son of Pompey.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.921
So it is!

37:45.431 --> 37:47.797
Quintus, my old cock,

37:47.933 --> 37:50.140
how good to see you so.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.850
Explain.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.811
Well, it's like this, your honour.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.851
He, this one, come to find the gold.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.769
What gold?

37:58.902 --> 38:02.770
The gold that Pompey's boys stole
from the treasury, sir.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.246
— Pompey does not have it?
- He doesn't, sir.

38:19.173 --> 38:21.164
Now, I meant no disrespect,

38:21.300 --> 38:26.340
and had I known the gold
was from the treasury, I'd not have touched it.

38:26.472 --> 38:30.465
— But there was this girl here, sir...
— Never mind her. Speak to the point.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.305
Where is the gold?

38:34.438 --> 38:36.394
It's all safe, sir.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.186
l buried it deep in the woods

38:40.319 --> 38:43.982
couple of miles from the Flaminian gate.

38:47.201 --> 38:48.566
Thank you.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.560
You will pay for this!

39:24.696 --> 39:28.029
— Surely you can do better than that.
— Leave him be.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.740
I'm sorry we meet like this.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.361
l have only deep respect
for your father and his family.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.702
Kiss my arse, you traitorous dog.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.246
Elegant little fellow, isn't he?

39:41.338 --> 39:44.080
You need not fear.
Your life is yours still.

39:44.216 --> 39:47.299
I'm sending you back to your father
with an offer of truce.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.964
— A truce?
— Quiet.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.213
Are you run mad?

39:52.349 --> 39:55.341
When we have them
on their backs in the sand?

39:55.477 --> 39:57.559
Be quiet.

39:59.064 --> 40:03.103
An offer of equable truce on good terms.

40:03.235 --> 40:08.400
lf violence continues, it will not be my doing,
but that of your father and his allies.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.031
My father needs no truce.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.288
Two full moons will see you
on a spike in the Forum.

40:15.414 --> 40:18.747
- You wretch!
— Put him on a horse.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.593
You naughty woman.

40:30.846 --> 40:34.885
Never told me
Caesar had such a passion for you.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.258
Not so.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.476
I saw the way he looked at you.

40:40.731 --> 40:43.939
Like the bull that tupped Europa.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.522
I can't blame him.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.770
Such...

40:50.949 --> 40:52.450
beauty.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.277
Such beauty.

40:58.707 --> 41:00.823
Too kind.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.826
Far too kind.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.829
Caesar has no inclination to me.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.126
Nor l to him.

41:10.886 --> 41:12.968
And such modesty.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.807
Is she not beautiful, Calpurnia?

41:18.935 --> 41:23.679
She has none of the goatishness
one normally sees in women her age.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.306
She has some secret potion, perhaps.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.900
You are attempting levity, I believe.

41:29.655 --> 41:33.113
Forgive me if I do not indulge in such talk.

41:40.499 --> 41:46.290
You're sure to regret letting that one live.
He has a malevolent spirit.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.879
There's many left undead
l'll regret before I'm done.

41:51.843 --> 41:55.051
Take Pullo and retrieve the gold.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.296
Legionary Pullo.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.684
You are a thief. A foolish, incompetent thief.

42:05.816 --> 42:08.228
But you have served us well in the past.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.568
So we will pretend your foolishness
is a species of honesty,

42:11.697 --> 42:13.653
and let you go unpunished.

42:15.033 --> 42:18.525
In fact, I think we shall reward you.

42:18.662 --> 42:20.778
I do not like to quarrel with Fortune,

42:20.914 --> 42:23.405
and clearly she's taken you for a pet.

42:23.542 --> 42:27.160
When you find the trove,
give him 100 gold pieces.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.377
Thank you, sir.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.542
As you wish.

42:36.555 --> 42:39.672
By the by, Antony,
never question my judgment

42:39.808 --> 42:42.720
in the presence of our enemies.

42:42.853 --> 42:46.345
You have a good memory,
so you will remember that.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.063
— I will remember.
- Dismiss.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.855
Men, horses!

42:52.988 --> 42:55.570
- Quick about it!
— FonNard!

43:00.579 --> 43:02.615
Why do you frown, little owl?

43:02.748 --> 43:04.579
Mark Antony speaks sense.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.950
Truce now does not seem tactically correct.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.542
Depends on terms.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.758
You offer terms that Pompey cannot accept

43:13.884 --> 43:16.170
but Cicero and the Senate can.

43:16.303 --> 43:18.464
Swift...

43:19.681 --> 43:22.889
Hold up, dominus, there's people watching.

43:23.018 --> 43:25.930
Sir, take us somewhere none can see us.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.196
What's in him? Is he poisoned?

43:38.325 --> 43:41.067
He has the morbus comitialis. It will pass.

43:41.203 --> 43:43.945
Please, dominus, shut the door.

43:48.668 --> 43:51.660
— Should we not fetch a doctor?
— We should not.

43:51.797 --> 43:55.005
At all costs,
he cannot have his affliction known.

43:55.133 --> 43:59.752
No one will follow a man
whom Apollo has cursed with the morbus.

44:54.359 --> 44:58.477
Vow to Orcus, never speak of this.

45:35.859 --> 45:38.271
Are you quite well, husband?

45:38.403 --> 45:40.485
Nothing serious.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.354
Come.

45:45.702 --> 45:49.695
Atia, I'm growing tired.
I think we shall leave you.

45:51.333 --> 45:52.698
Oh, well.

45:52.834 --> 45:56.452
— As you wish, of course.
- Good night, my dear.

46:03.637 --> 46:07.505
— Did you have a pleasant evening?
- I did.

46:07.641 --> 46:10.178
Your niece Atia is most polite,

46:10.310 --> 46:14.303
and the Chief Augur made
many edifying remarks on religion.

46:14.439 --> 46:18.478
I regret I will not be coming home
with you immediately.

46:18.610 --> 46:21.647
- But you're not well.
— Really, I am quite recovered.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.647
l have urgent business
with my marsupial clerks.

46:24.783 --> 46:28.526
Business at night? It is not proper.

46:28.662 --> 46:30.152
Not proper, but necessary.

46:30.288 --> 46:35.658
l have to be ready to leave the city and
pursue Pompey as soon as he refuses truce.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.580
He will refuse?

46:38.505 --> 46:40.496
I believe so.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.365
What's wrong, Mother?

48:12.265 --> 48:14.096
I'm alone.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.341
I'm all alone.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.908
— What does he say?
- Ridiculous!

49:24.045 --> 49:28.004
- What does he say?
— Nothing. Nothing worth repeating.

49:31.803 --> 49:33.964
— But he offers a truce.
— On what terms?

49:34.097 --> 49:37.464
Truce with that scum?
Are you women?

49:37.600 --> 49:41.343
— I will have them raped by dogs!
- Silence. Get out!

49:41.479 --> 49:46.018
Excuse him. He's been ill-used.
But he is right. There can be no truce.

49:46.151 --> 49:50.360
- Of course not.
— But Caesar does not ask for so much.

49:50.488 --> 49:54.356
— Legal immunity. Mutual disarmament.
- I must disarm? l?

49:54.492 --> 49:59.202
I am lawful consul of Rome. He is a criminal.
There is nothing mutual in it.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.707
He may be a criminal, but he has the city.

50:01.833 --> 50:04.870
— We must deal with the facts.
- Fact is, he is a traitor!

50:05.003 --> 50:07.369
Let us be fair.

50:07.505 --> 50:11.839
Consul, he has been remarkably peaceable.

50:11.968 --> 50:15.210
He has not killed your allies
or violated your property.

50:15.346 --> 50:18.133
We should look on this offer seriously.

50:18.266 --> 50:22.054
Do you not see his stratagem?
He is trying to drive a wedge between us.

50:22.187 --> 50:25.054
— Perhaps so.
— A truce would buy us time at least.

50:25.190 --> 50:28.478
Quintus is right! You are women!

50:30.486 --> 50:32.147
Fools.

50:46.878 --> 50:51.372
Tell me you love him.
Tell me that and lwill go away

50:51.507 --> 50:54.214
and I will never come back.

50:55.929 --> 50:57.760
I love him.

50:57.889 --> 51:01.006
On the souls of my children, I love him.

51:05.855 --> 51:08.972
Titus Pullo, whatjoy!

51:09.108 --> 51:12.100
— They let you go alive, then?
— They did.

51:12.237 --> 51:13.352
Where's Vorenus?

51:13.488 --> 51:17.731
He's gone to make amends
at the shrine of Janus.

51:17.867 --> 51:21.155
You know Evander Pulchio,
my sister's husband.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.076
Evander, you say?

51:27.543 --> 51:31.206
— Good health, soldier.
- And you.

51:34.884 --> 51:37.261
— Will you take water?
- I will.

51:37.387 --> 51:39.423
Sit you down.

51:53.611 --> 51:56.819
Great Jupiter, graciously give us clear signs

51:56.948 --> 52:00.031
within the bounds l have traced.

52:25.226 --> 52:28.138
The auguries are good.
