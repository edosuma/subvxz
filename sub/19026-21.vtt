00:06.440 --> 00:10.149
<i>In my four years, there have been</i>
<i>many emergencies at Sacred Heart,</i>

00:10.240 --> 00:12.674
<i>but none like this one, because today...</i>

00:12.760 --> 00:15.320
Where is he?

00:16.360 --> 00:19.591
<i>Dr Cox's son needed two stitches.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:22.315
- I got here as soon...
- Shut it, Newbie.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.391
Your blacker half is concentrating.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.029
- How are you holding up?
- I'm a little nervous.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.111
Well, now you make me all nervous.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.954
I'd focus, because that tiny patch
of skin on my son's forehead

00:34.040 --> 00:36.474
is more important to me
than then entirety

00:36.560 --> 00:38.710
of your high-fiving, head-shaving,

00:38.800 --> 00:41.678
air-balling,
insulin-needing existence,

00:41.760 --> 00:45.958
which I guarantee will come
to an abrupt, very unnatural end.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.514
OK, I'm done.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.431
<i>We all held our breath together.</i>

00:52.880 --> 00:54.552
The surgeon lives!

00:58.000 --> 01:00.560
The Todd forgot to breathe again.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.870
Starting CPR.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.630
Mr Gerst, what seems to be the problem?

01:06.720 --> 01:09.075
- I took some pills.
- Come on, help me out here.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.436
Happy pills, sad pills,
sleeping pills, sane pills, pain pills,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.750
- brain pills, Spain pills...
- Man pills.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.355
The commercial says consult a physician
if the condition persists

01:18.440 --> 01:20.874
- for more than four hours.
- If what persists?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.071
Let's just say you took uppers.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.711
Dude, check out what I found
when I was taking out the trash!

01:36.240 --> 01:38.629
That is the most ridiculous hat
I've ever seen.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.233
<i>And I must have it.</i>

01:40.520 --> 01:42.636
Aren't you gonna be late to meet Carla?

01:42.720 --> 01:43.789
I've got time.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.839
Turk and Carla were having trouble,
so she'd been staying at Elliot's.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.319
You were late the last time.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.198
But I set the clock ahead
an hour so I wouldn't be late.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.590
I set it back three so we could see
what it felt like in Honolulu.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.274
I set it ahead five
so I wouldn't feel like a skeeve

01:58.360 --> 01:59.839
for watching porn in the day.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.549
I set it back to 8.08, turned it upside
down to see if it looked like "Bob",

02:03.640 --> 02:05.551
- which it does...
- That's true.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.393
Which means that it's actually...

02:09.440 --> 02:10.429
- 9.52!
- 9.52!

02:10.520 --> 02:13.239
My God! I gotta be downtown
in, like, eight minutes!

02:13.400 --> 02:15.914
Dude, we're never gonna make it in time!

02:16.000 --> 02:20.039
- Take a shortcut through that hedge!
- You got it, player!

02:20.680 --> 02:22.910
Hold on, buddy!

02:26.800 --> 02:29.997
- That was a thick bush.
- Really, Turk, was it a thick bush?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.958
Because there's berries in my ass.
Just go!

02:35.200 --> 02:37.589
Sorry. My bad, dude. My bad.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.400 --> 02:49.197
Don't worry, Turk, I got 'em!

02:52.200 --> 02:53.872
<i>Strike!</i>

02:56.400 --> 02:59.039
Turk, why are you wearing pyjamas?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.031
I really want you to come home,

03:01.120 --> 03:04.157
and on the off chance you said yes,
I'd be ready to snuggle,

03:04.240 --> 03:07.437
and that would hopefully lead to,
but necessarily require,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.432
relations of the intimate nature.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.911
Turk, with everything that's happened,
I'm just having trouble trusting you.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.912
If there's anyone in this world
you can trust, it's me.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.470
Turk, you're the one I don't know
if I can trust, so how am I supposed

03:21.560 --> 03:24.711
to trust that I can trust you telling me
that I can trust you?

03:24.800 --> 03:27.439
My head hurts.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.275
I wish I knew how it was going.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.118
Sorry about your hogs, fellas.
Enjoy the free espressos.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.836
Warlord, I told you to sip it.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.796
- Use your words.
- Warlord burn mouth.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.552
He did, cos he wasn't listening.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.518
Napkin on your lap, Satan's Valet.
Thank you.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.598
Hey, what are you doing, Frankenstein?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.875
Photo journal for my photography class.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.554
Terrific. Could I see your camera?

04:15.640 --> 04:18.313
Very interesting.
Oh, there's film in it.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.108
Hey! All my pictures were in there!

04:22.200 --> 04:25.158
"Dead Patient With Shirt",
"Dead Patient Without Shirt",

04:25.240 --> 04:27.629
"Me in Shirt Being Yelled
at by Angry Family".

04:27.720 --> 04:29.915
Do you have any idea
of what would unfold

04:30.000 --> 04:31.956
if Jordan were to see that picture?

04:32.040 --> 04:35.919
It is a heart-wrenching tale of woe
involving Jordan's second cousin,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.991
who plays for the New England Patriots,

04:38.080 --> 04:41.072
and me having a Super Bowl ring
removed from my oesophagus.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.594
Jordan's never going
to see these stitches.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.671
Well, I hope you realise this means war.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.751
Buzz off, you big monkey.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.514
Poor Mr Gerst.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.353
What's that like,
to have an erection for nine hours.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.032
Ask me in 20 minutes.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.910
Get this. He doesn't have erectile
dysfunction. Why take those drugs?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.194
What's this?

05:02.280 --> 05:05.397
Why, it's a dummygram,
and it's addressed to you, Barbie.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.109
Let's read it and find out what's
in there. You are disturbingly naive.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.876
Stop. Almost 50 percent of ED drugs
are taken by recreational users.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.235
- Stop.
- That can't be true.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.271
Everyone, would you go ahead
and close your eyes for a second?

05:20.360 --> 05:24.148
Great. Now, would all the men in the
room who have tried Mr Happy pills

05:24.240 --> 05:27.277
go ahead and grab your fork
and bang your glass.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.713
Thank you.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.632
Ted, everyone stopped!

05:37.600 --> 05:40.034
Oh, damn it!

05:42.320 --> 05:45.517
- She's got this trust issue.
- Just tell her she can trust you.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.273
I did. If I'm the one
she didn't know she could trust,

05:48.360 --> 05:51.079
how is she supposed to trust me
telling her she can?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.878
- My head hurts.
- Mine did too.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.518
- I need you to go in.
- No way.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.751
It's never smart to get
in the middle of a relationship.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.319
I'll let you wear my top hat.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.960
Hey! Want to grab a beer?

06:02.040 --> 06:03.598
Lose the hat.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.471
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.232
What's with all the Band-Aids?

06:10.320 --> 06:14.711
Jack was getting nutty, having some fun.
See, I even let him put one on me.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.756
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.197
- Are those stitches?
- What are the odds you'd pick that one?

06:22.280 --> 06:24.748
Jack just...
He just fell off of the jungle gym.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.558
You're not careful enough!

06:26.640 --> 06:29.154
What about the time he brained himself?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.356
- That was an accident.
- Quick question.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.431
Why is it an accident
when he's with you,

06:33.520 --> 06:36.432
but when Jack gets hurt on my time,
I'm not careful enough?

06:36.520 --> 06:38.511
Because I...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.875
Oh, dear God.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.871
You're speechless.

06:43.960 --> 06:48.476
I won! I won an argument.
Jack, it's unprecedented.

06:48.560 --> 06:52.269
We'll be at the playground
drinking beer. Oh, God, we love beer!

06:52.360 --> 06:53.839
But...

06:56.920 --> 07:00.037
That guy needs to do some
serious thinking about baseball.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.429
- He wouldn't even let me see it.
- Meathead.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.679
Good, you both looked.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.479
Now, Mr Gerst came here for help,
and we're doctors,

07:07.560 --> 07:11.109
so how about we try and treat him
with a bit of dignity and respect?

07:12.520 --> 07:15.273
That man is a human sundial.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.311
It's so nice to get out.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.792
Do you know who sings the song?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.155
I can tell you who doesn't:
Billy Joel,

07:28.240 --> 07:31.038
who brought us hits
as <i>Uptown Girl</i> and <i>Matter of Trust.</i>

07:31.120 --> 07:34.032
Speaking of trust,
you know who's trustworthy? Turk.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.193
I call him Turkey-Turkey-Turkey-
Turkey-Trust-Trust. A little nickname.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.352
J.D., I know what you're
trying to do and it's very sweet,

07:41.440 --> 07:44.796
but the last couple of days have
been so messed up and confusing,

07:44.880 --> 07:48.077
I'd love to just try and forget about it
and have a few drinks, OK?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.594
I'd talk about him
until you made me leave.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.116
- I'll let you put the hat back on.
- Two appletinis, governor.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.754
Look at my girl.
Right back up on the monkey bars,

07:59.840 --> 08:02.149
after she chipped
her tooth there last week.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.518
My kid's got a forehead full of stitches
from leaping off the jungle gym.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.558
When my wife's not around,
I let her stand on my shoulders.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.154
Really? Wait till you
get a load of this.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.354
OK, here we go. What are we doing?
Come here, you. You come here, you.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.113
Giant man,
why are you making that noise?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.555
Because my camera
doesn't make a real sound,

08:23.640 --> 08:26.473
and it's more fun that way.
See? You go...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.989
Look happy. Look sad.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.111
Look crazy.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.712
Look like you're going away.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.554
You need to set
an example of professionalism.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.950
You're not gonna do that
by making fun of that man's slinky-doo.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.272
Don't pull me!
I'm your boss, for God's... Hello!

08:50.360 --> 08:54.069
Well, Mr Gerst, your situation
doesn't seem to be reversing itself,

08:54.160 --> 08:57.789
so I think we're gonna need to
schedule a procedure to relieve the...

09:00.160 --> 09:02.355
Woodiness.

09:02.440 --> 09:06.035
My fiancée is 24. She said she
wanted to do something special.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.396
Turns out she just meant
having breakfast with her family.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.438
Those pills didn't kick in
until just about the moment

09:12.520 --> 09:14.988
I'm introduced to her
90-year-old grandmother.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.108
And sure enough, that little lady gives
me the waist hug from her wheelchair.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.394
I need that chart.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.233
Sweetheart, it's not healthy
to hold it in. Let it out.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.276
- You know you want to.
- I'm fine.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.990
I pulled away from that encounter with
Grandma Helen's breathing apparatus.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.275
My work here is done.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.877
Oh, my God, I can't stop!
I'm sorry. I have to pee.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.879
OK, J.D., why are we sitting up here?

09:46.960 --> 09:50.953
Because you can see Elliot's
whole apartment from up here.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.758
J.D., you're drunk.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.549
Carla, I'm not as think
as you drunk I am.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.957
Then why can't you let go of the couch?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.679
I can let go of the couch
if I so choose.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.115
OK, let go of the couch. Let it go.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.953
You see?

10:15.840 --> 10:19.594
<i>There are many things we can't control,</i>
<i>no matter how strong we might be...</i>

10:20.720 --> 10:23.075
<i>... like a knee-jerk reaction...</i>

10:23.160 --> 10:26.197
I am so sorry.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.750
I'm done. I'm done. Yes.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.353
It's OK.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.354
<i>... or a janitor who has it in for you.</i>

10:39.360 --> 10:43.194
Hi. Look what someone
was nice enough to give me.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.712
Janitor.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.073
Oh, thank you for helping me
have some fun tonight.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.037
You're welcome.

10:58.120 --> 11:02.159
<i>Sometimes you let go of the control you</i>
<i>do have in a brief moment of weakness.</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:09.874
Sorry. Drunken accident.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.518
- Nothing happened.
- Right.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.192
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.998
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.470
- <i>Buenas...</i> nose things.
- Good night.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.675
<i>Like she said, everything's fine.</i>

11:27.960 --> 11:30.520
<i>There's nothing like the rays</i>
<i>of the morning sun</i>

11:30.600 --> 11:35.037
<i>reminding you that you got drunk</i>
<i>and kissed your best friend's wife.</i>

11:35.120 --> 11:38.112
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

11:38.200 --> 11:40.191
- It really happened?
- It was nothing!

11:40.280 --> 11:42.316
- There wasn't tongue!
- No tongue!

11:42.400 --> 11:44.391
- A friend kiss.
- Were your lips parted?

11:44.480 --> 11:46.198
No, I pursed them like this.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.714
I remember my one lip
being on top of your lip,

11:48.800 --> 11:50.870
my other lip in the middle of yours.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.191
Your lips were apart
and I don't think that's a friend kiss!

11:54.280 --> 11:57.113
It's a friend kiss,
and we will never talk about this!

11:57.200 --> 11:59.111
- All right.
- What's going on?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.633
- Nothing.
- We kissed.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.119
- Carla!
- A friend kiss?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.269
- Yes. Carla!
- No!

12:03.360 --> 12:04.793
You're killing me!

12:07.960 --> 12:11.032
- This never leaves the room!
- Why did you close my window?

12:14.760 --> 12:18.548
Oh, no! She wrote "J.D. And Carla
kissed" and she's gonna tell Turk!

12:18.640 --> 12:20.949
No, no, stop her!

12:21.040 --> 12:23.679
Don't worry, ladies,
I've closed the window.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.114
J.D., I don't have a messenger monkey.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.190
All right, fine, I'm a little rougher
than you are, but guess what?

12:38.280 --> 12:41.556
The two of us have two distinctly
different parenting styles.

12:41.640 --> 12:47.317
You're an overbearing psychotic,
and I'm, well, you know... fun.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.632
If we can meet somewhere in the middle,
I think Jack's gonna be terrific.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.190
Besides, it's not like I ever
put him in any real danger.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.715
Flip!

12:56.800 --> 12:59.360
Flip? What does "flip" mean, Perry?

12:59.440 --> 13:03.831
Jack probably thinks that Mommy and
Daddy are being a little too sarcastic.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.989
Maybe.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.548
Or it's because
every time he says "flip",

13:07.640 --> 13:10.950
Daddy does a little trick
where he grabs Jack by the ankles,

13:11.040 --> 13:15.431
he flips him upside down, he drops him
down onto his shoulders and then...

13:15.520 --> 13:17.590
...puts him in a little baby trapeze,

13:17.680 --> 13:20.399
shoots him across
the sand box without a net.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.592
You are never taking Jack
to the park without me. Ever!

13:24.680 --> 13:26.159
Jordan.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.879
- A trapeze?
- Yeah. Photoshop. You can do anything.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.599
Here I have you wearing
a duck's bill. Get it?

13:35.560 --> 13:37.118
Because you're a quack.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.439
No?!

13:39.520 --> 13:42.398
Come on. Classic comedy, my friend.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.311
He'll learn.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.870
I'm a horrible person. There I was,
on my high horse about Mr Gerst,

13:47.960 --> 13:50.269
then I turned out to be as bad
as everyone else.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.557
Give yourself some credit.
You were worse than everyone else.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.916
Maybe I was, but you know what?
I'm gonna try and better myself.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.356
Unlike you, I'll follow through,
Mr Sign Up on the Bulletin Board

14:00.440 --> 14:03.113
for German Lessons
and Never Show Up. That's right.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.599
It was my flier...

14:06.920 --> 14:10.435
I broke up with my German mistress.
She smells like sauerkraut.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.919
I'm so sorry.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.833
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go into that room right now

14:14.920 --> 14:16.797
and own up to what I did.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.875
Hello? Did someone come in?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.228
<i>I had to hide from Turk,</i>
<i>so I went to the one place</i>

14:29.320 --> 14:31.311
<i>where I knew no one would ever venture.</i>

14:31.400 --> 14:34.119
Ted? Ted?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.555
- A little help!
- Ted, what are you doing?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.518
I like to do stomach crunches
after lunch.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.352
Ted, lunch was four hours ago.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.194
- Yep, I wasted most of my Tuesday.
- It's Wednesday.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.590
Oh, man, I missed the <i>Gilmore Girls!</i>

14:51.280 --> 14:53.157
- There you are. Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.437
- How did it go last night?
- What's with the fifth degree?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.432
- Don't you mean third degree?
- This is two degrees worse.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.988
I can't breathe.
I'm trapped in a death coffin.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.071
I wanted to see if you got anywhere.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.550
<i>He knows your lying face,</i>
<i>but silence is incriminating too. Think!</i>

15:07.640 --> 15:10.279
<i>What's between silence and talking?</i>

15:12.000 --> 15:15.231
Turk? I thought you could
take me over to Elliot's place

15:15.320 --> 15:17.550
to get my stuff so I could move back in.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.915
Yeah, sure... Really?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.675
- All right, meet me downstairs, OK?
- OK.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.591
I owe you one.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.513
You should sit down.
You're looking a little purple.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.477
I know my own body.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.955
- Thanks for saving my ass.
- Well, I wasn't saving your ass.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.838
I didn't realize how easy it is
to make little mistakes.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.559
They're stupid mistakes
that seem like nothing,

15:46.640 --> 15:50.952
but can snowball on you and take
your whole marriage with it, you know?

15:51.040 --> 15:56.797
I feel like I understand now how Turk
could have let stuff like that happen.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.075
So I forgave him.

15:59.160 --> 16:03.119
- Well, I guess I'm glad we kissed then.
- Me too.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.351
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, we are. Let's do it.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.592
OK, we just saw the plastic surgeon.

16:18.680 --> 16:22.878
Jack is fine, but if the cut was four
inches to the left and 7 inches deeper,

16:22.960 --> 16:25.428
it could have
potentially scratched his eye.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.229
- That was a close one.
- What a sweet little angel.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.756
Can I just give him a little squeeze?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.319
Of course.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.674
Back off there, lady.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.230
Save up all that energy for the cruise.
Go on, get out of here.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.073
Hippity-hop to the barber shop.
Come on, Mom.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.391
This hospital is literally
crawling with germs and disease.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.313
In all fairness,
you don't know if that lady is a sickie,

16:47.400 --> 16:50.676
visiting a sickie and she ran
her hands all over his sickie face.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.797
- I normally never let people touch him.
- Really?

16:53.880 --> 16:56.440
Because these photographs
would beg to differ.

16:56.520 --> 17:01.548
Old lady kissing Jack,
teenage girl hugging Jack,

17:01.640 --> 17:04.915
homeless man... holding Jack.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.594
- Jordan!
- It's just Carl.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.590
He holds Jack when I get a bikini wax.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.593
What's the matter with me? I don't
think twice about people holding him,

17:13.680 --> 17:17.150
yet I obsess about things
like broken arms, broken legs, choking,

17:17.240 --> 17:20.516
kidnapping, drowning,
bad babysitters, pretty babysitters.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.239
I freak out over staph infections,
blood disease,

17:23.319 --> 17:25.550
mumps, measles,
sex, drugs, rock and roll

17:25.640 --> 17:29.315
and all registered Independents.
Between us, we've got it covered.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.870
- Was this taken at my mother's house?
- I gotta go.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.108
Dude, that did not happen.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.352
No, I'm in the hospital because I...
They think I have avian flu.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.353
I gotta call you back.
How long have you been there?

17:45.440 --> 17:50.594
Oh, 47, 48 minutes. I'm not sure.
I nodded off for a while.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.036
Mr Gerst, I'm so sorry
for laughing at you.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.588
I have to tell a story.
In the seventh grade,

17:56.680 --> 17:59.558
I was at a roller rink
and I needed to go to the bathroom.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.155
So I just skated right on into a stall
and I did my private business.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.753
When I went to pull up my pants,

18:04.840 --> 18:07.832
I started rolling towards the door,
which wasn't latched.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.833
I don't know if you've had experience
skating with underpants at your ankles.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.309
Difficult to stop.
Unless, you scream so loud

18:14.400 --> 18:16.994
they turn off the music
and everyone looks at you.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.390
Anyway, that's how I wound up
with the nickname Roller Moler.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.313
- I'm sorry?
- I have a mole on my ass.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.994
The cute kind, not the hairy kind.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.878
The next day I showed up at school
with roller skates on,

18:28.960 --> 18:31.952
- and everybody cracked up.
- Why are you telling me this?

18:32.040 --> 18:35.157
Because I owned up to it.
This is funny, Mr Gerst.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.916
If you don't become part of the joke,
it will follow and devour you.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.709
- Can I get a look at that mole?
- No. No.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.552
This is nice, the three of us sitting
together again like three musketeers.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.438
Yeah. And I need you guys
to scrape your plates

18:53.520 --> 18:56.034
before you put them in the dishwasher.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.271
She's back. My baby's back!

19:01.360 --> 19:05.194
<i>Carla was right. If a relationship's</i>
<i>gonna work, it has to be based on trust,</i>

19:05.280 --> 19:07.919
<i>like a wife trusting her husband.</i>

19:08.480 --> 19:10.436
- Kid's back on the jungle gym.
- Sure.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.592
- Guess your wife backed down.
- Bet your sweet ass she did.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.716
<i>Even if it involves a compromise.</i>

19:17.240 --> 19:20.038
Hey, Jack! Just blink
when you want me to get you down.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.998
Just give me the old blink-a-roonie.
Terrific athlete.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.469
I'm thinking 2016 Olympics.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.710
Oh, God, was that a blink?
Excuse me.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.989
<i>Or a patient trusting his doctor</i>
<i>to help him hold on to his dignity.</i>

19:34.080 --> 19:37.436
Yes, and then I pulled off
Grandma's breathing apparatus.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.556
No, I'm serious.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.629
<i>It may take a lot of work,</i>
<i>but it's worth it.</i>

19:44.920 --> 19:48.196
Wow, that was a moist kiss.
Wish I was wearing an apron.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.193
Baby, from here on out,
I hide nothing from you.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.952
It's a clean start for us.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.879
Sports time!

19:56.960 --> 19:59.952
<i>Because in the end,</i>
<i>things work out for the best.</i>

20:01.200 --> 20:03.350
J.D. And I kissed.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.352
<i>Or not.</i>

20:10.305 --> 20:16.786
