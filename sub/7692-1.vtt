00:03.471 --> 00:05.473
**

00:05.506 --> 00:09.210
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME,
 MRS. DAVENPORT!

00:09.243 --> 00:11.312
WHY, THANK YOU,
 MR. DAVENPORT.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.382
ABSOLUTELY,
MRS. DAVENPORT.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.817
WE GET IT--
YOU GUYS ARE MARRIED.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.452
IT'S GETTING OLD.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.458
WOW!

00:24.492 --> 00:27.561
YOU GOT THIS BIG HOUSE
JUST FROM INVENTING THINGS?

00:27.595 --> 00:30.131
WAY TO GO, MOM.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.632
THAT'S A HUSBAND.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.504
OH, UH...HECK IS THAT?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.307
THAT IS MY LATEST CREATION.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.178
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES' FIRST
COMPLETELY INTERACTIVE 3-D TV.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.480
( beeping, humming )

00:46.514 --> 00:49.450
( organ plays "Charge!" )

00:49.483 --> 00:52.220
( crack of bat hitting ball,
 "crowd" cheering )

00:53.854 --> 00:56.124
WATCH THE VASE,
 TERMITE!

00:57.891 --> 01:00.861
MOM, I THINK THE LITTLE VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD IS BACK.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.432
NO, THIS IS EDDY.
HE'S MY SMART HOME SYSTEM.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.500
EDDY, THIS IS
MY NEW STEPSON, LEO.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.337
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU
LEO AND TASHA ARE
MOVING IN TODAY?

01:09.370 --> 01:12.306
HEY, WELCOME.
 EVERYTHING HERE IS MINE.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.510
UH, LEO, WHY DON'T YOU
GO CHECK OUT YOUR NEW BEDROOM?

01:16.544 --> 01:18.412
JUST GO STRAIGHT
DOWN THAT HALLWAY,

01:18.446 --> 01:20.514
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE ROOM
WITH THE VIDEO GAMES

01:20.548 --> 01:24.385
AND THE ACTION FIGURES
AND THE 50-FOOT-SCREEN TV,

01:24.418 --> 01:27.155
KEEP WALKING--
THAT'S MINE.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.226
THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

01:32.260 --> 01:35.496
I'M GONNA NEED A GPS
JUST TO FIND THE BATHROOM.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.465
( whooshing )

01:44.538 --> 01:46.340
HELLO?

01:51.412 --> 01:54.248
( Leo screaming )

01:55.449 --> 01:57.385
( bell dings )

02:06.560 --> 02:08.196
WHOA!

02:08.229 --> 02:11.465
MY NEW DAD IS BATMAN!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.570
( beeping )

02:16.604 --> 02:20.441
GOOD LUCK GETTIN' IN!
THAT STEEL DOOR IS
THICKER THAN YOUR HEAD!

02:20.474 --> 02:21.675
( loud clank )

02:26.380 --> 02:28.749
WELL, THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY TO GET IN.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.586
GIVE ME BACK MY ePOD!

02:32.620 --> 02:34.622
I DON'T HAVE IT!

02:36.590 --> 02:39.360
YOU TOOK MY ePOD!

02:41.362 --> 02:45.466
TAYLOR SWIFT MEGA-MIX--
REALLY?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.635
I FIND HER SOOTHING.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.472
( zapping )

02:51.505 --> 02:54.975
OH, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
SHOOT THAT LASER AT ME.

02:55.008 --> 02:59.247
OH, SORRY. IT WAS
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE--
JUST LIKE YOUR FACE.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.516
AAAAAH!

03:04.252 --> 03:05.619
AAAAAAAH!!

03:05.653 --> 03:08.356
AAAAAH!

03:08.389 --> 03:10.424
AAAAAAH!

03:10.458 --> 03:13.627
( all screaming )

03:13.661 --> 03:17.398
( Leo squealing )

03:17.431 --> 03:20.501
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
 SUPERHUMANS.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.503
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.572
FASTER, SMARTER--

03:24.605 --> 03:27.275
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:27.308 --> 03:29.443
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:29.477 --> 03:32.746
**

03:37.651 --> 03:39.687
All: AAAAHHH!

04:07.748 --> 04:10.651
OKAY, I DON'T PLAY
THIS CARD TOO OFTEN, BUT...

04:10.684 --> 04:12.653
MOM!!!

04:12.686 --> 04:14.388
LEO!

04:14.422 --> 04:17.690
LEO! THERE YOU ARE!
OH! ( laughing )

04:17.725 --> 04:21.329
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
WHO ARE THEY?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.398
UH--

04:24.432 --> 04:26.467
THEY, UH, ARE...

04:26.500 --> 04:28.369
A BOY BAND I'VE BEEN
WORKING WITH,

04:28.402 --> 04:31.472
UM, AND THE TWIST IS,
ONE OF 'EM'S A GIRL.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.377
ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE PART OF

04:36.410 --> 04:38.446
A SECRET PROJECT
I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING--

04:38.479 --> 04:42.483
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
SUPERHUMAN SIBLINGS.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.755
TASHA, LEO,
MEET ADAM, BREE AND CHASE--

04:47.788 --> 04:52.460
THE GREATEST COMBINATION
OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
EVER DEVELOPED.

04:52.493 --> 04:56.464
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,
BUT I AM INCREDIBLY SMART.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.437
DON'T LOOK AT ME--
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM INTERNET DATING.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.675
SO THEY'RE ROBOTS.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.778
OH, NO, SHE DIDN'T!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.647
NO, TASHA, THEY'RE HUMAN,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.349
I'VE JUST GIVEN EACH OF THEM

05:15.383 --> 05:16.817
A UNIQUE SET OF BIONIC ABILITIES

05:16.850 --> 05:19.753
CONTROLLED BY
A MICROCHIP IMPLANT
IN THEIR NECKS.

05:19.787 --> 05:23.757
IT SOUNDS A LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN IT IS.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.427
SEE, ADAM IS ALL BRUTE STRENGTH,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.729
AND BREE HAS SPEED AND AGILITY,

05:28.762 --> 05:31.799
AND CHASE HAS SUPER-SENSES
AND A SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.734
( laughing ) DONALD--

05:33.767 --> 05:34.768
HI--

05:34.802 --> 05:39.607
THERE ARE CHILDREN...
 LIVING IN OUR BASEMENT!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.775
THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC HABITAT.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.644
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT--
IT'S GOT A GAME ROOM

05:43.677 --> 05:45.779
AND A ROCK WALL--
ANYTHING A KID COULD ASK FOR.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.648
I'VE CREATED THIS PLACE
SO THEY CAN TRAIN

05:47.681 --> 05:49.683
IN THE UTMOST OF COMFORT
AND TECHNOLOGY.

05:49.717 --> 05:53.487
IT'S TRUE. THE TOILETS
HAVE SEAT-WARMERS THAT TALK.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.656
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.792
IT VARIES, NO.ENDING ON--

05:58.826 --> 06:00.728
DONALD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.698
SOME NEW WIVES GET SURPRISED
WITH A HONEYMOON IN HAWAII

06:04.732 --> 06:06.634
OR...A CRUISE.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.937
BIONIC TEENAGERS WERE NOT
ON OUR WEDDING REGISTRY.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.441
HONEY, THEY HAVE TO
STAY DOWN HERE FOR
THEIR OWN SAFETY.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.775
THIS IS ALL VERY TOP-SECRET.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.544
BUT AS SOON AS
THEIR TRAINING IS COMPLETE,

06:16.577 --> 06:19.547
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE
ANY CRISIS OR PROBLEM

06:19.580 --> 06:20.781
THAT THE WORLD
THROWS AT THEM.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.816
I WANT TO GO TO PARIS.RAMIDS.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.152
I WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.954
HEY, WHAT ARE THOSE?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.756
TIME MACHINES?

06:28.789 --> 06:32.626
NO, THEY'RE NOT TIME MACHINES.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.563
THE TIME MACHINES ARE
ACTUALLY IN THE SHOP.

06:35.596 --> 06:39.633
THESE ARE MY BIOLOGICALLY
REGULATED ATMOSPHERIC CHAMBERS

06:39.667 --> 06:43.804
WHERE MY BIONIC CREATIONS
LIVE AND SLEEP AND EAT.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.840
WHICH REMINDS ME,
IT'S YEAH!RTIME.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.710
( beeping )

06:49.743 --> 06:51.745
READY?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.616
( buzzer )

06:56.884 --> 06:58.819
THESE ARE MY PATENTED
PROTEIN PELLETS.

07:05.593 --> 07:09.029
WHATEVER THEY DON'T CATCH
IS TOMORROW'S BREAKFAST.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.867
OKAY, CHASE.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.737
ENEMY GRENADE,
THREE O'CLOCK!

07:20.908 --> 07:24.578
HEY! WHY DOES
HE GET A FORCE FIELD,
AND I DON'T?

07:24.612 --> 07:27.047
'CAUSE IF YOU HAD ONE,
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.752
OKAY, YOU GUYS TAKE
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.221
I'M GONNA GO SPEAK
AT A TECH CONFERENCE--
BECAUSE I'M AWESOME--

07:34.254 --> 07:36.724
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE SPEEDBOATS DETAILED,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.892
AND THEN I'M GONNA
GO GET WAXED.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.794
DON'T JUDGE ME.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.798
WELL, I BETTER
GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.901
OOH! I HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED
ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.538
PASSING NOTES,
GOING TO PROM,

07:50.571 --> 07:53.641
BREAKING INTO CHOREOGRAPHED
DANCE NUMBERS AFTER MATH CLASS.

07:56.076 --> 08:00.247
YEAH. ALL WE DO IS EAT,
SLEEP, AND TRAIN FOR MISSIONS.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.249
WE'RE LIKE HUMAN LAB RATS.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.251
COME ON,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.087
( squeaking )

08:09.322 --> 08:11.959
SO, YOU'VE NEVER
LEFT THIS ROOM?

08:13.026 --> 08:14.728
THAT EXPLAINS
THE HAIRCUTS.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.598
I BET SCHOOL'S FUN.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.934
YOU KNOW, EXCEPT FOR BOOKS,
CLASSES, AND LEARNING STUFF.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.003
IT'S NOT FUN WHEN
YOU'RE "THE SMART KID."

08:23.036 --> 08:27.675
WELL, DOWN HERE,
SMART IS CONSIDERED SUPERIOR.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.910
NO, IT'S NOT.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.078
HEY, YOU GUYS SHOULD
COME TO SCHOOL WITH ME!

08:32.111 --> 08:34.782
YOU COULD BE
MY BIONIC BODYGUARDS!

08:34.815 --> 08:36.316
I'M IN!O!

08:36.349 --> 08:40.821
Eddy:
 NOT ON MY WATCH,
 LASER BRAINS!

08:40.854 --> 08:44.625
AW, SHOOT. WE FORGOT ABOUT
DAVENPORT'S CREEPY COMPUTER.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST IN THE LIVING ROOM!

08:50.764 --> 08:52.700
IN MY SHOWER?!

08:52.733 --> 08:54.935
YEP. AND BY THE WAY,

08:54.968 --> 08:59.006
NOTHING NEEDS
 TO BE THAT CLEAN,
 SPORT-O.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.008
OKAY, WE NEED TO
SHUT THAT THING OFF.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.310
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, OKAY?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.613
EDDY IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX

09:05.646 --> 09:07.748
AND SOPHISTICATED
PIECE OF MACHINERY.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.982
IT WOULD TAKE YEARS BEFORE--

09:09.016 --> 09:11.118
AHA! SWEET!

09:11.151 --> 09:13.821
I BARELY GOT
ELECTROCUTED!

09:13.854 --> 09:16.323
OKAY, COME ON.
IF WE'RE GONNA
GO TO SCHOOL,

09:16.356 --> 09:17.858
WE SHOULD SHOWER FIRST,

09:17.891 --> 09:20.661
BECAUSE TWO OF US
REALLY STINK.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.062
( both sniffing )

09:22.095 --> 09:23.631
OHH.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.969
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.006
YEAH!

09:33.040 --> 09:35.075
( dryer humming )

09:47.187 --> 09:50.157
OH, GREAT. YOU GAVE ME
YOUR UNDERWEAR BY MISTAKE.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.092
GROSS!

09:53.661 --> 09:54.995
WHAT ARE YOU
COMPLAINING ABOUT?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.630
I GOT THE BRA.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.204
WHOA-HO-HO-HO-HO!

10:05.806 --> 10:08.776
( giggling )

10:08.809 --> 10:13.046
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ACTUALLY AT SCHOOL.
I AM SO EXCITED!

10:13.080 --> 10:15.048
OH, MY FIRST
LUNCH LADY.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.922
SHE SMELLED LIKE
FISH STICKS.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.659
DO ME A FAVOR
AND TRY TO ACT LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN THE WORLD.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.094
I HAVE A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD HERE.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.129
AHHH!

10:31.131 --> 10:33.801
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO, STEVE!

10:35.102 --> 10:38.706
HI! I'M BREE!
I LIKE PONIES AND GIRL THINGS.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.978
DID YOU SEE THAT?
I HAVE BESTIES.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.781
I CAN'T WAIT TO
STAB THEM IN THE BACK!

10:47.815 --> 10:51.118
HERE, LITTLE LADY,
LET ME HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.058
ADAM!

10:58.091 --> 10:59.993
WOULD YOU TWO
QUIT GOOFING OFF?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.930
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO NOT
DRAW ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.232
AAAAH! AAAH! AAAH!

11:05.265 --> 11:07.868
( screaming )

11:10.137 --> 11:12.773
WHAT'S UP WITH CRAZY?

11:12.806 --> 11:15.242
HE HAS ULTRA-SENSITIVE
BIONIC HEARING.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.878
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.112
IT'S CALLED A BELL.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.750
IT RINGS EVERY 40 MINUTES,
EIGHT TIMES A DAY.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.152
SO...HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.798
I HATE WHY?CLASS.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.737
AAAH!

11:43.771 --> 11:46.039
THAT'S WHY.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.778
SO BIG DEAL--
YOU CAN'T PLAY BASKETBALL.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.047
CHESS CLUB'S WHERE
ALL THE ACTION'S AT.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.218
WHATTHROW IT.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.123
TO SOMEONE WHO'S LOOKING.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.196
WOW! YOU CAUGHT THAT
WITH YOUR FACE!

12:10.563 --> 12:14.167
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO
SHOW THESE FOOLS UP

12:14.201 --> 12:16.536
AND GO ALL NBA
IN THEIR FACES.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.907
THENLOOK AT ME!YOU?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.175
THERE'S MORE MEAT
ON A DOG BONE!

12:22.209 --> 12:27.147
YEAH, BUT NOW
YOU HAVE US TO HELP YOU.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.148
HUH?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.051
WAIT--WHAT? NO!!!
THESE ARE MY GOOD DRAWERS!

12:31.084 --> 12:33.921
AAAAAHHH!!!

12:36.289 --> 12:37.858
AAAAH!

12:38.959 --> 12:40.193
OOH.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.175
YEAH, I GOT MAD SKILLS!

12:55.208 --> 12:57.244
YEAH!

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
HEY, HONEY.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.888
OH, OKAY. SO WE HAVE KIDS
LIVING IN THE BASEMENT,

13:07.921 --> 13:11.191
AND WE WALK ON
 THE FURNITURE--
 GOT IT.

13:11.224 --> 13:15.829
THE ALARM IN LAB WENT OFF,
EDDY'S BEEN DISABLED,
AND THE KIDS ARE GONE.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.998
THOSE ANIMALS
 YANKED MY WIRES!

13:18.031 --> 13:20.267
AND ONE OF 'EM
 MANHANDLED
 MY MOTHERBOARD!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.269
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?!

13:22.302 --> 13:24.938
OH, I'M SORRY.
 WERE YOU TALKING TO ME,

13:24.972 --> 13:26.073
OR THE WIFE YOU
 REPLACED ME WITH?!

13:26.106 --> 13:29.977
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT LIKE
 A NEW PAIR OF SHOES, TOO!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.079
FINE!

13:32.112 --> 13:34.247
THEY WENT TO SCHOOL
 WITH...(sneers)...LEO.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.216
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.253
THEY CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL--
NOT WITHWHAT...GLITCHES?

13:40.287 --> 13:43.991
BECAUSE THEY'RE HUMAN,
THEIR EMOTIONS CAN TRIGGER
THEIR BIONICS.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.960
IF ONE OF 'EM GETS
A LITTLE NERVOUS OR UPSET

13:46.994 --> 13:49.229
OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT
TOO HUH-HUH?

13:49.262 --> 13:53.400
THEY COULD TAKE OUT EVERYTHING
FROM HERE TO TIJUANA.

13:53.433 --> 13:58.138
WHAT?! YOU DID NOT
MENTION THIS ON
YOUR PROFILE.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.306

14:18.926 --> 14:21.895
AND THERE'S BEEN
 A CERTAIN GENTLENESS
 TO MY WEDGIES.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297

14:55.495 --> 14:58.665

15:05.438 --> 15:08.408

I MEAN, YES, I HAVE!
MY WHOLE LIFE'S A PARTY!

15:11.711 --> 15:14.081

15:30.463 --> 15:32.432

15:32.465 --> 15:35.435
WHENEVER HE GETS TOO UPSET
HIS HEAT VISION ACTS UP!

15:43.410 --> 15:47.514
Cheerleaders:
* WE'RE DINGOES, WE'RE HERE,
THERE'S NOTHING-- *

15:47.547 --> 15:49.749
( screaming )

15:49.782 --> 15:52.119
I GOT HER! I GOT HER!

15:52.152 --> 15:54.121
OH. OOPS.

15:54.154 --> 15:59.292
OVERSHOT IT. BUT DON'T WORRY,
I KNOW A CHIROPRACTOR
IN THE PHILIPPINES.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.028
( groaning )

16:02.562 --> 16:05.332
I HOPE DO YOU SMELL SMOKE?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.200
WE'RE TOO LATE.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.069
( fire alarm )

16:09.102 --> 16:10.537
PEOPLE. PEOPLE.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.472
STATISTICS SHOW THAT
IF WE DON'T PANIC,

16:12.505 --> 16:16.343
AT LEAST 70% OF US
WILL MAKE IT OUT ALIVE.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.246
( all screaming )

16:21.114 --> 16:23.450
( screaming continues )

16:26.419 --> 16:27.787
OH, NO!

16:27.820 --> 16:31.358
THEY KILLED DEWEY DINGO!

16:37.464 --> 16:40.133
HEH HEH HEH HEH...

16:40.167 --> 16:43.136
SO...HOW WAS SCHOOL?!

16:44.404 --> 16:47.140
GET IN THE HELICOPTER!

16:53.513 --> 16:55.082
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

16:55.115 --> 17:00.320
I HAD TO WRITE A CHECK
TO THAT SCHOOL FOR 30 GRAND
TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.490
FOR 30 GRAND, I'LL GO AWAY.

17:03.523 --> 17:07.194
WE'RE SORRY.
WE JUST WANTED TO BE
NORMAL FOR A DAY.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.196
OH, COME ON, DONALD,
THEY'RE JUST KIDS.

17:10.230 --> 17:15.202
WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE,
ME AND FIONA MICKLEJOHN,
WE SNUCK AND WE CRASHED--

17:15.234 --> 17:17.503
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT HELPING.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.474
LOOK, I DESIGNED YOU GUYS TO GO
ON HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MISSIONS,

17:22.509 --> 17:25.578
NOT TRY OUT FOR
THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.216
OH...WELL,
THERE GOES THAT DREAM.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.485
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD, BIG D,

17:32.519 --> 17:36.256
BUT THESE GUYS PERFORMED
THE IMPOSSIBLE TODAY--

17:36.289 --> 17:39.126
THEY MADE ME POPULAR.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.363
I GOT GAME!

17:43.396 --> 17:46.633
AND I CURED MALE
PATTERN BALDNESS
WITH A BIOLOGY RAT.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.137
OOH! AND I GOT INVITED
TO MY FIRST PARTY!

17:50.170 --> 17:52.505
HOW EXCITING!

17:52.539 --> 17:55.575
WE GOTTA GET YOU CLOTHES
AND SHOES, AND WE'LL DO--

17:55.608 --> 17:58.278

17:58.311 --> 18:00.547
THAT'S IT. LEO,
YOU ARE BANNED FROM THE LAB.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.317
AND YOU THREE ARE TO HAVE NO
CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.553
NO TALKING, NO TEXTING,
NO NOTHING.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.589
OOH! WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST ART OF PANTOMIME?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.461
GO TO YOUR TUBES!

18:18.698 --> 18:22.502
SO, DO ALL FUZZY ANIMALS
HAVE GIRLS INSIDE THEM,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.604
OR JUST THE DINGOES?

18:26.306 --> 18:29.242
IF MR. DAVENPORT'S
SUCH A GREAT SCIENTIST,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.678
THEN HOW COME
I'M NOT A LITTLE STRONGER

18:31.711 --> 18:34.481
AND YOU'RE NOT A LOT SMARTER?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.651
I DON'T KNOW...
BUT DOES THIS HURT?

18:38.685 --> 18:41.120
OHH!

18:42.322 --> 18:44.557
NOW I'M NEVER
GONNA HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.595
GUESS I'LL JUST KEEP
FAKE-KISSING THAT WALL.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.200
OH, WE'VE ALL DONE IT!

18:55.668 --> 18:58.371
LEO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE DOWN HERE!

18:58.405 --> 19:03.410
I KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW THAT PARTY
EVERYONE AT SCHOOL'S

19:03.443 --> 19:06.646
IT'S IN YOUR LIVING ROOM!!!

19:06.679 --> 19:09.416

19:23.596 --> 19:27.600

AND SINCE YOU COULDN'T GO,
I BROUGHT THE PARTY HERE.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.602
CHEESE CURL?

19:29.636 --> 19:32.205
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOM AND DAVENPORT?

19:32.239 --> 19:34.707
THEY'RE AT DINNER.
THEY'LL BE GONE FOR HOURS.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.610
JIMMY, GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF HERE. IT'S A MICROWAVE.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.682

19:44.784 --> 19:48.621
AND IF IT'S NOT BETTER
BY MONDAY, THEY'RE GONNA
DRAIN IT.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.623
CAREFUL THERE, BUDDY.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.394
THAT PIECE OF CAKE
HAS APPROXIMATELY
47 GRAMS OF SUGAR.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.364
IF YOU EAT IT, YOU'LL BE
BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS
FOR HOURS.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.765
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

19:58.798 --> 20:02.402
'CAUSE I JUST HAD
12 PIECES!

20:02.435 --> 20:03.503
WHOO-HOO!

20:23.723 --> 20:27.260
HOW DID THESE PEOPLE
GET HERE?!

20:27.294 --> 20:31.030
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE,
MISTER.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.700
HEY, EVERYBODY!
THANKS FOR COMING.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.303
GET OUT!!!

20:37.670 --> 20:40.473
( door closes )

20:40.507 --> 20:43.410
YOU KIDS HAVE
REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.811
AND WHO GAVE EDDY CAKE?!

20:48.748 --> 20:52.051
I JUST WANTED THEM TO HAVE
ONE MORE NIGHT OF FUN

20:52.084 --> 20:54.621
BEFORE YOU PUT THEM BACK
IN THEIR DISPLAY CASES.

20:54.654 --> 20:59.492
BIOLOGICALLY REGULATED
ATMOSPHERIC CHAMBERS.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.660
LOOK, THE FUN'S OVER.

21:00.693 --> 21:04.731
AS OF TOMORROW,
YOU'RE ALL BEING
RELOCATED PERMANENTLY.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.798
WHAT?

21:05.832 --> 21:06.599
WHAT PART OF

21:06.633 --> 21:09.436
"NO CONTACT WITH
THE OUTSIDE WORLD"

21:09.469 --> 21:10.803
DIWHERE ARE WE GOING?D?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.772
TO ONE OF MY REMOTE
RESEARCH FACILITIES

21:12.805 --> 21:15.308
WHERE YOU CAN
COMPLETE YOUR TRAINING.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.576
BUT THIS IS HOME.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.845
THIS IS WHERE I GET
MY MEATY-FLAVORED PELLETS.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.849
NOT ANYMORE.
NOW GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND PACK YOUR STUFF.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.890
THIS ISN'T FAIR.
THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.062
DONALD, WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO REALIZE THAT

21:36.095 --> 21:38.731
THEY'RE NOT JUST
SCIENCE PROJECTS?

21:38.765 --> 21:41.534
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.376
ANY CHANCE WE CAN
 SHIP HER OFF, TOO?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.477
NO!

21:50.510 --> 21:53.680
OKAY, JUST CHECKING.

21:59.719 --> 22:03.856
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
OUR LAST NIGHT IN THE LAB.

22:03.890 --> 22:07.694
I THINK LEO'S
REALLY GONNA MISS US.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.562
YEAH, ME TOO.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.503
THINK WE SHOULD
WAKE HIM UP?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.905
NO, LET HIM SLEEP.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.508
BUT HE'S DROOLING
ON MY SOCKS.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.416
**

22:30.650 --> 22:31.718
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.553
IF DAVENPORT IS
GONNA SHIP US OFF

22:33.586 --> 22:34.887
TO SOME REMOTE FACILITY,

22:34.921 --> 22:38.357
THEN THE OFFICE SUPPLIES
ARE COMING WITH US.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.662
WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST
TASTE OF NORMAL LIFE.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.465
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO GETTING A CURFEW

22:45.498 --> 22:47.800
WHICH I WAS
TOTALLY GONNA BREAK.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.803
OOOH! BUT MAYBE WHEN WE GET
TO WHEREVER WE'RE GOING,

22:50.837 --> 22:53.540
WE'LL MEET A SASSY
LAB CHIMP NAMED BOBO

22:53.573 --> 22:56.543
WHO WILL TAKE US ON ADVENTURES
AND TEACH US HOW TO LOVE.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.478
OR MAYBE YOU'LL
MAKE HIM ANGRY

22:58.511 --> 23:00.480
AND HE'LL MAUL YOU
AND SNACK ON YOUR FINGERS.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.916
HEY. I CREATE THE MONKEY
FANTASIES AROUND HERE.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.655
WELL, KIDS, I HOPE YOU'VE
 ENJOYED YOUR STAY

23:08.688 --> 23:10.423
AT CASA DAVENPORT.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.459
I KNOW I HAVEN'T.
SAYONARA!

23:12.492 --> 23:16.429
EDDY, I KNOW WE'VE NEVER BEEN
THE BEST OF FRIENDS,

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
BUT WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.600
OH, REALLY?

23:20.633 --> 23:21.601
WE HATE YOU!

23:21.634 --> 23:23.736
YOU'RE EVIL!

23:23.770 --> 23:26.573
WHERE IS THIS TRAINING
FACILITY ANYWAY?

23:26.606 --> 23:27.940
FACILITY X?

23:27.974 --> 23:30.643
OH, IT'S ALL THE RAGE.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.545
THAT'S PRETTY NICE.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.714
OOPS! SORRY!
 THAT'S MY SCREEN SAVER.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.485
YOU'RE GOING HERE.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.587
FORGET ABOUT
OFFICE SUPPLIES.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.188
WE SHOULD BE
GATHERING WOOD.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.991
MAN.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.927
I WISH I HADN'T
THROWN THAT PARTY.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.463
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.800
OH, THAT'S BECAUSE
IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.869
ADAM, HE WAS ONLY
TRYING TO HELP US.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.571
WELL, YEAH, BUT HE DID
THE OPPOSITE,

23:58.605 --> 23:59.706
WHICH IS NOT HELP US.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.641
THE NOT MAKES
IT THE OPPOSITE.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.578
I'M JUST SO BUMMED.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.547
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
WE'VE EVER KNOWN.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.615
YEAH.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.951
JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE
MEMORIES WE'VE SHARED HERE.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.987
IF THE ATOM HAS TOO MANY
OR TOO FEW ELECTRONS,

24:15.021 --> 24:17.023
THE ATOM IS CALLED AN ION,

24:17.056 --> 24:20.226
AND IT HAS A POSITIVE
OR A NEGATIVE CHARGE.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.829
AND THAT'S HOW
BATTERIES ARE MADE.

24:22.862 --> 24:23.896
THE END.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.034
WHOA. WHOA.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.936
OKAY, ADAM.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.272
YOU CAN PUT ME DOWN NOW.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.508
( giggles )

24:35.542 --> 24:38.511
HEY! COME BACK WITH THAT!

24:38.545 --> 24:39.779
( giggles )

24:39.812 --> 24:42.582
COME BACK WITH THAT BOOK!

24:42.615 --> 24:44.684
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
YOU'RE KICKING UP ALL THIS DUST,

24:44.717 --> 24:46.819
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE CHASE'S
SUPER SENSES GLITCH,

24:46.853 --> 24:47.987

24:50.690 --> 24:51.524
( giggles )

24:51.558 --> 24:54.527
SNEEZE.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.699
I CAN'T LET DAVENPORT
SEND YOU GUYS AWAY.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.668
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

25:01.701 --> 25:05.805
NO ONE CAN SAY NO TO THIS
MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE.

25:05.838 --> 25:06.773
NO!

25:06.806 --> 25:08.675
UH-UH.AT IF--

25:08.708 --> 25:10.009
DON'T YFORGET IT.

25:10.042 --> 25:14.046
WHATLA LA LA!

25:14.080 --> 25:16.649
WELL...

25:16.683 --> 25:19.118
I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S
GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.692
LEO, THERE YOU ARE.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.961
HONEY, I KNOW YOU'RE SAD
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS LEAVING.

25:28.995 --> 25:32.565
BUT THINK OF ALL THE TIME
YOU'LL GET TO SPEND WITH ME.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.701
OOOH! WE CAN PLAY
YOUR LITTLE VIDEO GAME.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.703
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WHERE YOU HOLD THE THINGY

25:36.736 --> 25:38.671
AND YOU MOVE
THE OTHER THINGY.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.841
MOM, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

25:41.874 --> 25:44.877
IT IS WAY TOO LATE IN LIFE
FOR YOU TO LEARN VIDEO GAMES.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.084
GOOD MORNING,
HAPPY FAMILY.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.620
WHAT IS THAT?

25:54.854 --> 25:57.657
WHATEVER IT IS,
DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED.

25:59.992 --> 26:03.796
LOOK, LEO, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
MISS ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE.

26:03.830 --> 26:07.033
SO, I LASER SCANNED
THEIR FEATURES

26:07.066 --> 26:09.335
ONTO THESE
BIO-SYNTHETIC ROBOTS

26:09.368 --> 26:12.705
AND I PROGRAMMED THEM WITH
THEIR CORE PERSONALITY TRAITS.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.008
IS THIS GREAT OR WHAT?

26:16.042 --> 26:18.678
IT'LL BE LIKE THEY NEVER LEFT.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.146
( clanging )

26:22.782 --> 26:25.918
AH!

26:25.952 --> 26:27.620
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:27.654 --> 26:28.888
I THINK THE EXCITEMENT

26:28.921 --> 26:31.190
OF HAVING A BILLIONAIRE DAD
JUST WORE OFF.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.961
DONALD, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.696
I KIND OF PREFER LEO
TO HAVE FRIENDS

26:36.729 --> 26:40.132
WHO CAN'T MALFUNCTION
AND TEAR HIM LIMB FROM LIMB.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.205
WHAT ARE THOSE?

26:47.774 --> 26:49.642
OH, DR. FRANKEN BRAIN HERE

26:49.676 --> 26:52.044
IS TRYING TO REPLACE YOU
WITH CREEPY ROBOTS.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.746
WELCOME TO CRAZY TOWN.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.649
( beeping, warbling )

26:56.683 --> 26:57.950
GOOD MORNING.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.919
THE TIME IS 11:22

26:59.952 --> 27:02.922
AND THE TEMPERATURE
IS CURRENTLY 68 DEGREES.

27:04.223 --> 27:07.894
YOU MADE A ROBOT OF ME
THAT JUST STANDS AROUND

27:07.927 --> 27:10.129
TELLING PEOPLE THE TIME
AND THE TEMPERATURE?

27:11.831 --> 27:14.701
THAT'S THE COOLEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN!

27:20.239 --> 27:22.208
DOES MY NOSE REALLY
LOOK LIKE THAT?

27:22.241 --> 27:23.710
( warbling )
NO.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.645
YOURS HAS A FAINT
MOUSTACHE UNDERNEATH.

27:27.780 --> 27:31.684
( laughter )

27:31.718 --> 27:34.186
HEY, EVERYONE.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.695
THAT IS NOT FUNNY.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.932
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S FUH-- FUH-- FUNNY.

27:49.769 --> 27:50.903

27:54.841 --> 27:55.975
HEY, FITZ.

HE'S A KARAOKE MASTER.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.923
WELL, I GUESS THIS IS IT.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.726
THANKS FOR
EVERYTHING, LEO.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.796
YEAH, YOU'RE THE BEST
FRIEND WE'VE EVER HAD.

28:16.829 --> 28:20.867
NO, HE'S THE ONLY FRIEND
WE'VE EVER HAD.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.904
WELL, DON'T FORGET TO BUNDLE UP
ON YOUR DEADLY MISSIONS.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.512
HEY, REMEMBER,
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.914
WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTIONS,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.783
YOU MIGHT FINISH
YOUR TRAINING EARLY.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.892
( warbling )
 WHOO HOO! THEY'RE GONE!

28:45.925 --> 28:47.760

29:06.879 --> 29:09.849
GET LOST.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.318
YOU CAN'T REPLACE
MY REAL FRIENDS.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.553
I REALLY LOVED THOSE GUYS.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.957
DON'T BE SAD,
MR. LEO.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.926
FRIENDS COME AND GO.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.261
BUT ROBOTS ARE FOREVER.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.563
DIBBLY. DIBBLY.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.866
THAT IS MY VERSION
OF A LAUGH.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.802
DIBBLY. DIBBLY.

29:29.836 --> 29:33.205
WILL TIN EYES GET
OUT OF HERE?

29:33.239 --> 29:35.207
SENSING HUMAN HOSTILITY.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.076
MUST EXTERMINATE.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.577
ROBOTS ATTACK.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.848
YEAH, GO ROBOTS!
 GET HIM! CRUSH HIM!

29:42.882 --> 29:44.150

DESTROY LEO.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.986
( screams )

29:48.620 --> 29:51.157
LEO, LEO.
WE'RE NOT ROBOTS.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.959
IT'S REALLY US.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.260
HUH?

29:54.293 --> 29:56.162
WE TOLD THE DRIVER
WE FORGOT SOMETHING,

29:56.195 --> 29:58.197
AND THEN WE SWAPPED
THE ROBOTS IN OUR PLACE.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.100
YOU SAID YOU LOVED US.
YOU SAID YOU LOVED US.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.102
( loud kisses )

30:03.135 --> 30:04.336
OW!

30:04.370 --> 30:07.039
IT IS YOU GUYS!

30:13.012 --> 30:14.380
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT DAVENPORT?

30:14.413 --> 30:16.082
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO ACT
LIKE DUMB ROBOTS

30:16.115 --> 30:18.084
EVERY SINGLE
TIME HE'S AROUND.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.253
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR SOME
OF US THAN OTHERS.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.588
HEY, LEO.

30:22.621 --> 30:26.625
BIG D, DONNY,
MAN OF THE HOUSE!

30:32.631 --> 30:35.968
I AM HANGING WITH

30:36.002 --> 30:38.837
MY ROBO-FAKE

30:40.039 --> 30:42.208

AIN'T NO PARTY
LIKE A ROBOT PARTY

30:42.241 --> 30:44.143
'CAUSE A ROBOT
PARTY DON'T STOP.

THE GREATEST THING

30:53.052 --> 30:54.620
ABOUT HAVING ROBOTS IS?

30:54.653 --> 30:55.922

30:55.955 --> 30:57.890
THEY ARE VIRTUALLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.291
WATCH THIS.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.127
( crackling )

31:01.160 --> 31:02.394
NO, IT'S OKAY.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.630
HE CAN'T FEEL A THING.
HE'S A ROBOT.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.665
( crackling, shuddering )

31:06.698 --> 31:10.002
HA HA! THEY ARE SO
INCREDIBLY LIFELIKE.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.171
( crackling, shuddering )

31:12.204 --> 31:14.140
DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.043
OOOH, YOU'RE
A FEISTY ROBOT, YOU.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.911
YOU WANNA GIVE IT A TRY?

31:18.945 --> 31:20.346
COME ON, DO IT.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.948
JUST DO IT ONCE.
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.082
( screams )

31:24.483 --> 31:27.486
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS FUN.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.124
**

31:32.158 --> 31:33.993
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK

31:34.026 --> 31:35.061
SO WE CAN GET
OUT OF HERE.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.128
ADAM, FOR BREAKFAST,

31:36.162 --> 31:38.064
YOU GET WHEAT BREAD
AND A SIDE OF SUGAR PACKETS.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.298
MY FAVORITE!

31:40.699 --> 31:42.468
BREE, YOU GET TWO OLD WINGS

31:42.501 --> 31:44.003
AND A DRUMSTICK
FROM THE CHICKEN SHACK.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.037
OOOH!

31:45.071 --> 31:50.042
AND CHASE, YOU CAN HAVE
THE PEEL TO MY BANANA.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.945
I'M NOT EATING A BANANA PEEL.

31:52.979 --> 31:53.946
YOU DON'T EAT IT.

31:53.980 --> 31:57.016
YOU JUST CHEW IT TILL
ALL THE FLAVOR'S GONE.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.220
LEO!

32:01.253 --> 32:02.321
WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:04.123 --> 32:05.724
MOM!

32:05.757 --> 32:07.994
LOOK AT YOU.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.496
IN THE KITCHEN.

32:10.529 --> 32:14.333
WE ARE JUST HAVING
A HEALTHY BREAKFAST.

32:14.366 --> 32:18.137
HONEY, THEY'RE ROBOTS,
THEY DON'T EAT.

32:19.271 --> 32:23.075
ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY,
I WAS THINKING,

32:23.109 --> 32:25.211
TODAY MIGHT BE A GOOD DAY
TO TAKE THEM TO SCHOOL WITH ME.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.345
YES!

32:27.379 --> 32:30.282
I MEAN, BEE-DEE-BEEP.

32:30.316 --> 32:34.053
DEE-DEE-BEEP BEEP. BEEP.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.056
LEO, YOU'RE NOT TAKING
ROBOTS TO SCHOOL.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.991
YOUR TEACHERS ALREADY THINK
YOU'RE A LITTLE WEIRD.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.259
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.994
BECAUSE ON YOUR LAST
PROGRESS REPORT,

32:42.028 --> 32:44.263
IT SAID, "WE THINK
LEO'S A LITTLE WEIRD."

32:44.296 --> 32:47.133
MOM--

32:47.166 --> 32:48.334
GO TO SCHOOL.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.102
FINE.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.540
YOU GUYS STAY OUT OF TROUBLE
UNTIL I GET BACK HOME.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.008
HUG IT OUT.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.382
HEY, HONEY.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.553
DONALD, YOU HAVE GOT
TO GET RID OF THOSE ROBOTS.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.288
LEO THINKS THEY'RE REAL.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.024
HE NEEDS TO BE
AROUND NORMAL KIDS.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.026
HONEY, WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP,

33:14.060 --> 33:15.361
I NEVER HUNG OUT
WITH NORMAL KIDS.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.030
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND
IS A COMPUTER IN THE WALL.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.301
I GUESS YOU LOST THAT BATTLE.
 HUH, TASHA?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.238
DONALD, I DON'T
WANT THEM AROUND.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.174
THEY'RE... CREEPY.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.309
WELL, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

33:30.342 --> 33:31.443
JUST THROW THEM AWAY?

33:31.477 --> 33:32.144
( all gasp )

33:32.178 --> 33:34.380
NO, I WOULD
NEVER EXPECT YOU

33:34.413 --> 33:35.814
TO JUST THROW THEM AWAY.

33:35.847 --> 33:36.582
( all sigh )

33:36.615 --> 33:38.050
RECYCLE THEM.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.185
( all gasp )

33:39.218 --> 33:40.319
WAIT, YOU WANT ME TO TAKE

33:40.352 --> 33:41.587
MY GENIUS TECHNOLOGY

33:41.620 --> 33:43.589
AND HAVE IT CRUSHED
AND MELTED DOWN

33:43.622 --> 33:46.058
AND TURNED INTO HUBCAPS?
NO WAY.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.193
( all sigh )

33:47.226 --> 33:49.161
EITHER THEY GO,

33:49.195 --> 33:52.064
OR I TURN YOUR LAB
INTO MY WALK-IN CLOSET.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.400
THREE CRUSHED
ROBOTS COMING UP.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.401
( gasp )

33:55.434 --> 33:58.570
WHAT? HE SAID HE WAS
GETTING RID OF THE ROBOTS.

33:58.604 --> 34:06.612
YE-- OH!

34:06.645 --> 34:10.315
**

34:14.620 --> 34:16.188
WHERE ARE THE ROBOTS?

34:16.222 --> 34:20.092
I RAN ALL THE WAY HOME,
AND I WASN'T EVEN BEING CHASED!

34:20.126 --> 34:22.494
LEO, THE ROBOTS ARE GONE.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.596
WE JUST DROPPED THEM OFF
AT THE RECYCLING FACILITY.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.565
YOU WHAT?

34:27.599 --> 34:31.637
YEP. THEY'RE BEING
MELTED DOWN AS WE SPEAK.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.505
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
THEY'RE PROBABLY TOXIC.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.243
NO! WE HAVE TO GO GET THEM!

34:37.275 --> 34:39.545
THEY'RE NOT ROBOTS,
THEY'RE REAL!

34:39.578 --> 34:42.880
OKAY, SEE, THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T
WANT THOSE THINGS AROUND.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.382
HE'S DELUSIONAL.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.619
NO. IT'S REALLY
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.655
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME!
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME!

34:49.688 --> 34:52.257
LEO, STOP.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.525
LEO, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

34:53.559 --> 34:56.128
I HAD TO SAY GOODBYE
TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS.

34:56.161 --> 34:59.365
THERE WAS LAVA MAN
AND STRETCH LEGSTRONG

34:59.398 --> 35:01.133
AND JO JO BIGGS

35:01.167 --> 35:03.135
AND ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
IN THE SPACE CANTINA.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.304
THOSE ARE ALL ACTION FIGURES.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.474
MORE LIKE FULLY POSEABLE
PIECES OF MY HEART.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.581
( screaming )

35:21.320 --> 35:25.591
THAT WAS AWESOME!

35:25.624 --> 35:27.359
GREAT PLAN, ADAM.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.595
LET'S JUST HIDE IN
THE RECYCLING TRUCK

35:29.628 --> 35:30.662
AND SEE WHERE WE END UP.

35:30.696 --> 35:34.300
WELL, WHO COULD'VE PREDICTED
THAT THE RECYCLING TRUCK

35:34.333 --> 35:37.536
WOULD DUMP US IN
THE RECYCLING CENTER?

35:37.569 --> 35:41.207
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.509
LOOK, WE HAVE TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF THIS PLACE.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.277
YEAH, I WANNA GO HOME.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.612
WE CAN'T GO HOME.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.180
IF DAVENPORT SEES US,

35:48.214 --> 35:50.216
HE'S JUST GONNA TRY
AND SEND US AWAY AGAIN.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.718
OH, RIGHT.

35:52.751 --> 35:56.222
WELL, THEN LET'S JUST GO FIND
A NEW SCIENTIST/FATHER

35:56.255 --> 35:57.923
WITH A HIGH-TECH BASEMENT
LAB AND LIVE THERE.

35:57.956 --> 35:58.757
YOU KNOW?
DONE AND DONE.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.429
LOOK! THERE'S
A DOOR RIGHT THERE!

36:03.462 --> 36:04.663
OH, COME ON.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.210
WELL, BREE,
YOU'RE THE FASTEST,

36:18.244 --> 36:21.213
SO YOU SHOULD GO FIRST.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.180
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:22.214 --> 36:24.416
THERE'S PLENTY OF DISTANCE
BETWEEN US AND THAT.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.751
WE'RE FINE.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.219
( screams )

36:27.253 --> 36:29.355
( whirring )

36:29.388 --> 36:31.757
AND BY FINE I MEAN
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

36:31.790 --> 36:34.793
( all scream )

36:36.262 --> 36:39.465
( alarm blares )
 INTRUDER! INTRUDER!

36:39.498 --> 36:41.767
EDDY, IT'S JUST TASHA.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.001
OH.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.337
( alarm blares )
 INTRUDER! INTRUDER!

36:47.806 --> 36:49.808
( musical ring tone )

36:54.280 --> 36:55.347
HELLO?

36:56.782 --> 37:01.253
YEAH, I'LL ACCEPT THE COLLECT
CALL FROM FACILITY X.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.790
FITZ, I KNOW IT'S YOU.
I CAN HEAR YOU BREATHING.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.259
YOU WHAT?

37:07.293 --> 37:09.495
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.363
WHAT KIND OF AN IDIOT
DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

37:11.397 --> 37:13.532
BETWEEN A ROBOT
AND A BIONIC SUPERHUM--

37:13.565 --> 37:16.268
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.803
THE KIDS NEVER SHOWED UP.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.738
THEY SENT THE ROBOTS
IN THEIR PLACE.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.006
( gasps )
SO LEO WAS--?

37:21.039 --> 37:23.409
TELLING THE TRUTH
THE WHOLE TIME.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.610
EDDY, WHERE'S LEO?

37:24.643 --> 37:25.811
OH, HE LEFT.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.779
SOMETHING ABOUT
 A RECYCLING CENTER,

37:27.813 --> 37:29.781
NEGLECTFUL PARENTS,
 LIFE AND DEATH,

37:29.815 --> 37:30.816
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.818
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US ANY OF THIS?

37:32.851 --> 37:34.353
YOU DIDN'T ASK.

37:34.386 --> 37:37.356
**

37:39.758 --> 37:41.793
( grunting )

37:41.827 --> 37:43.662
OOOH, FIVE POCKETS.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.597
HEY, YOU GUYS THINK
I SHOULD TRY THESE ON?

37:50.869 --> 37:53.672
( warbling )

37:56.542 --> 37:59.578
OKAY, IT TAKES THREE SECONDS
TO CLEAR THE CRUSHER.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.046
ADAM, IF YOU TIME
IT RIGHT,

38:01.079 --> 38:03.415
YOU CAN USE YOUR SUPER
STRENGTH TO RESIST THE FORCE

38:03.449 --> 38:04.282
AND WE CAN ALL
SLIDE UNDER IT.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.652
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
I DON'T TIME IT RIGHT?

38:06.685 --> 38:08.286
TRY TO TIME IT RIGHT.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.524
( loud whirring )

38:16.895 --> 38:18.397
NOW WHAT?

38:18.430 --> 38:20.866
( loud clanging )

38:20.899 --> 38:22.868
OKAY, ONCE THESE JAWS CLOSE,

38:22.901 --> 38:26.338
WE HAVE EXACTLY 1.7 SECONDS
TO GET THROUGH.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.607
I GOT THIS.
GRAB ON.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.879
OKAY, NO ALL WE HAVE TO DO

38:33.912 --> 38:35.714
IS GET PAST THIS FIRE
AND WE'RE HOME FREE.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.749
OH, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE--

38:37.783 --> 38:39.685
WHOA.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.354
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

38:42.388 --> 38:43.655
LOOK, OKAY, IF WE'RE
NOT GONNA TRY TO ESCAPE,

38:43.689 --> 38:46.525
I'M GONNA GO BACK
FOR MY JEANS.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.227
CHASE, WHAT'S WRONG?

38:49.260 --> 38:52.498
ALL THIS BURNING TRASH
IS MAKING MY SUPER SENSES--

38:52.531 --> 38:54.332
AAAA-CHOO!

38:55.867 --> 38:57.135
GLITCH.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.105
SWEET. YOU PUT IT OUT
WITH YOUR SNOT CANNONS.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.940
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.746
( screaming )

39:09.581 --> 39:10.782
LEO?

39:10.816 --> 39:13.919
NO. IT'S OPRAH.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.554
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

39:16.955 --> 39:18.424
MR. DAVENPORT!

39:18.457 --> 39:21.493
HELLO, WE ARE ROBOTS.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.563
DUDE, I THINK HE KNOWS.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.365
WELL, NOW HE DOES?

39:30.902 --> 39:33.439
( screams )

39:34.806 --> 39:36.842
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY
TO SHUT IT OFF.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.444
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME!

39:38.477 --> 39:40.479
GUYS, I HAVE AN IDEA.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.481
( screaming )

39:45.651 --> 39:46.952
AH, IT NEVER GETS OLD.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.887
LEO.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.188
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.523
I CAME TO SAVE YOU GUYS.

39:51.557 --> 39:52.958
OH, THANKS.
WE'RE GOOD.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.960
HA. SWEET KID.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.862
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.964
OKAY, LEO,
HOLD ON TO ADAM.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.198
WE'RE GONNA SURROUND YOU

40:00.231 --> 40:02.200
AND THEN WE'LL ALL GO
THOUGH IT TOGETHER, OKAY?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.869
THREE, TWO--

40:03.902 --> 40:05.471
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

40:07.573 --> 40:11.176
( recycler stops )

40:11.209 --> 40:13.479
THAT WOULD BE
THE OFF BUTTON.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.182
YEAH.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.517
OH, YOU GUYS
DIDN'T SEE THAT?

40:21.687 --> 40:22.954
**

40:22.988 --> 40:25.491
( warbling )

40:26.992 --> 40:31.463
YOU ALL MADE IT HOME SAFE
 AND SOUND AND ( raspberry ).

40:31.497 --> 40:32.831
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU KIDS WERE THINKING

40:32.864 --> 40:33.999
PULLING A STUNT LIKE THAT.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.535
YOU COULD'VE SERIOUSLY
HURT YOURSELVES.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.703
YEAH, BUT YOU
GOTTA ADMIT,

40:37.736 --> 40:41.473
MY ROBOT ACCENT
WAS DEAD ON.

40:41.507 --> 40:44.910
CAN WE PLEASE TAKE HIM BACK
TO THE RECYCLING CENTER?

40:46.512 --> 40:48.614
AND, LEO, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL US

40:48.647 --> 40:50.482
THAT ADAM, BREE
AND CHASE WERE STILL HERE?

40:50.516 --> 40:53.752
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT MY FRIENDS.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.787
AND I'M STILL GONNA
PROTECT MY FRIENDS.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.489
THAT'S RIGHT.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.891
YOU WANNA SEND THEM AWAY,
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME FIRST.

40:59.925 --> 41:03.261
IT'S GO TIME,
LITTLE MAN.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.930
IT'S NOT THE SIZE
OF THE DOG IN THE FIGHT,

41:04.963 --> 41:06.932
IT'S THE SIZE OF
THE FIGHT IN THE DOG.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.034
THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHT
IN THIS LITTLE DOGGIE.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.869
COME ON! UH-HUH!

41:15.541 --> 41:17.943
LEO, CALM DOWN.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.044
THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.513
OH, DON'T YOU--
WAIT, WHAT?

41:22.648 --> 41:24.983
WATCHING YOU GUYS RISK YOUR
LIVES FOR EACH OTHER

41:25.016 --> 41:26.518
MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING.

41:26.552 --> 41:27.953
MAYBE I'VE BEEN
FOCUSING TOO MUCH

41:27.986 --> 41:29.755
ON TRAINING THE SUPER HUMAN
SIDE OF YOU,

41:29.788 --> 41:31.289
AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT
THE HUMAN PART.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.291
AWWW.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.493
I DON'T GET IT.

41:37.028 --> 41:39.531
YOU'RE TEENAGERS.

41:39.565 --> 41:40.766
AND BIONIC OR NOT,

41:40.799 --> 41:42.968
YOU DESERVE TO EXPERIENCE
TEENAGER THINGS.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.604
LIKE SCHOOL AND CLASSES
AND CELL PHONES.

41:45.637 --> 41:46.872
YES! A CELL PHONE!

41:46.905 --> 41:49.274
I'M LIVING THE DREAM.
WHOO!

41:49.307 --> 41:51.577
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A CELL PHONE.

41:52.711 --> 41:55.581
BUT WHAT I CAN GIVE YOU IS

41:55.614 --> 41:57.816
ANOTHER CHANCE.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.552
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
THAT YOU CAN LIVE HERE,

42:00.586 --> 42:02.821
GO TO SCHOOL
AND GO ON MISSIONS.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.055
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

42:04.089 --> 42:06.024
SO THEY CAN STAY?

42:06.057 --> 42:07.959
ON ONE CONDITION.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.962
NO ONE CAN EVER FIND OUT
ABOUT YOUR ABILITIES.

42:10.996 --> 42:12.731
AND YOU HAVE TO CONTROL
YOUR EMOTIONS

42:12.764 --> 42:13.699
SO YOU DON'T GLITCH.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.333
ABSOLUTELY.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.836
ALL RIGHT, THEN,
WELCOME HOME.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.638
WHOO HOO!
YEAH!

42:29.014 --> 42:30.749
WHOOPS!

42:32.017 --> 42:34.586
HE HAS PLASMA GRENADES?

42:34.620 --> 42:36.922
MY LIFE JUST GOT
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.758
**

42:42.060 --> 42:43.829
I'M JUST NOT SURE
ABOUT THE THROW PILLOWS.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.130
THEY'RE A LITTLE PLAIN.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.132
I GOT THESE.
ARE THEY TOO BUSY?

42:47.165 --> 42:48.133
NO.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.601
SO YOU LIKE THEM?

42:49.635 --> 42:51.136
I DO IF YOU DO.

42:51.169 --> 42:54.172
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.743
( laughter )

42:57.776 --> 43:01.747
THAT ROBOT MAY BE MY
GREATEST INVENTION EVER.

43:04.182 --> 43:05.684
( electricity crackling )

43:05.717 --> 43:07.786
WHAT THE--?

43:09.888 --> 43:10.922
DONALD!

43:12.157 --> 43:16.594
All:
UH-OH, BUSTED!

43:17.696 --> 43:20.699
