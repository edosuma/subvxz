WEBVTT

00:05.246 --> 00:07.938
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:08.077 --> 00:10.941
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:11.080 --> 00:15.498
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:15.636 --> 00:18.363
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:18.501 --> 00:21.435
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:21.573 --> 00:25.370
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:27.199 --> 00:29.615
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:29.753 --> 00:32.377
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:32.515 --> 00:34.862
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:35.000 --> 00:37.623
Just to get up that hill

00:37.761 --> 00:40.212
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:40.350 --> 00:42.835
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:42.973 --> 00:45.321
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:45.459 --> 00:47.012
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:47.150 --> 00:49.911
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:50.050 --> 00:52.880
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:53.018 --> 00:57.436
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:57.574 --> 01:00.301
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:00.439 --> 01:03.511
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:03.649 --> 01:07.860
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:31.229 --> 01:32.747
Hey, Weezy,
how you doin'?

01:37.338 --> 01:40.514
Florence!
Don't you ever touch me
like that again!

01:40.652 --> 01:42.447
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you.

01:42.585 --> 01:43.655
Didn't you see
me working?

01:43.793 --> 01:45.967
Yeah, that's why
I didn't know it was you!

01:47.176 --> 01:48.556
Where's Weezy?
I don't know.

01:48.694 --> 01:50.282
I don't get paid
to watch Mrs. Jefferson.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.491
You ain't gonna
get paid at all if you
don't button your lip.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.114
At least I can
button my lip.

01:54.252 --> 01:55.805
You need
a heavy duty zipper!

01:57.876 --> 01:59.429
Look, Florence,

02:01.431 --> 02:03.433
if you don't shut up,
you're gonna be
in big trouble.

02:03.571 --> 02:05.435
I already am.
I'm working for you.

02:05.573 --> 02:08.024
Florence!
George!

02:08.162 --> 02:10.337
What's going on?
Florence is
mouthing off again.

02:10.475 --> 02:11.545
He started.
No, I didn't.

02:11.683 --> 02:12.684
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't!

02:12.822 --> 02:13.892
Yes, you did!
I did not!

02:14.030 --> 02:15.342
You did so!

02:15.480 --> 02:16.895
I was in there working,
bending over,

02:17.033 --> 02:19.035
and he come sneaking up
behind me and put his...

02:19.173 --> 02:21.762
She's right. I started it.
I started the whole thing.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.663
Well, that's a first.

02:26.801 --> 02:28.148
You admitting
you were wrong?

02:28.286 --> 02:30.667
I didn't say I was wrong.
I said I started it.

02:30.805 --> 02:32.566
Oh, I should
have known better.

02:32.704 --> 02:34.844
Come sit down, George.
I wanna talk to you.

02:35.707 --> 02:37.053
I saw that!

02:38.986 --> 02:42.162
What's the matter now?
She stuck her
tongue out at me.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.199
Will you please sit down?
I've got something
important to tell you.

02:45.337 --> 02:46.856
Is it something bad?

02:46.994 --> 02:48.651
No, it's something
marvelous.

02:48.789 --> 02:50.860
Good. I can
sit down for that.

02:50.998 --> 02:54.726
Well, we are starting a new
experimental program
down at the Help Center.

02:54.864 --> 02:56.141
Hey, that's
great, Weezy!

02:56.279 --> 02:59.524
And what we are doing is
placing a few high school...

03:00.801 --> 03:02.458
George!
Want a drink?

03:04.080 --> 03:06.807
Why is it every time
I mention my work
at the Help Center,

03:06.945 --> 03:08.429
you lose interest?

03:08.567 --> 03:10.466
Look, Weezy,
I'm proud of what
you're doing down there.

03:10.604 --> 03:14.228
But you can't
expect me to get excited
about women's work.

03:14.366 --> 03:18.059
Well, you got pretty excited
about women's work last night.

03:19.406 --> 03:22.202
Hey, Weezy, stop...

03:24.134 --> 03:28.000
Look, George, we are helping
tenants who have problems
with their landlords.

03:28.138 --> 03:29.485
We are helping the sick.

03:29.623 --> 03:32.384
And we are helping
the old people who
can't help themselves.

03:32.522 --> 03:34.559
And you call that
women's work?

03:34.697 --> 03:36.630
Well, you don't carry
nothing heavy.

03:39.149 --> 03:40.703
Do you like
your nose where it is,

03:40.841 --> 03:42.739
or would you like
to have it in Cleveland?

03:44.845 --> 03:47.917
Okay, Weezy, I'm dying
to hear about your
experimental program.

03:48.987 --> 03:50.471
What we are doing is

03:50.609 --> 03:53.923
placing a few high school
students in part-time jobs.

03:54.061 --> 03:55.511
It's a work-school program.

03:55.649 --> 03:56.857
Oh, well, that
ain't nothing new.

03:56.995 --> 03:59.135
I was in a work-school
program when I was a kid.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.689
You were?
Yeah, I quit school
and I went to work.

04:04.347 --> 04:07.039
George, these kids
still have to go to
school in the morning,

04:07.177 --> 04:09.145
but they can work
in the afternoon.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.836
And if all goes well,

04:10.974 --> 04:14.012
the school board
may even give the kids
credit for working.

04:14.150 --> 04:15.910
Hey, that's
a great idea.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.602
Then you'll do it?

04:17.740 --> 04:19.604
Do what?
Give Marcus a job.

04:20.674 --> 04:22.020
Who's Marcus?

04:22.158 --> 04:24.919
He's the kid I picked
to work in your store.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.474
Well, you better
unpick him, 'cause
he ain't working for me.

04:29.027 --> 04:30.442
But, George,
you said last week

04:30.580 --> 04:32.686
you needed another man
to work in the store.

04:32.824 --> 04:34.791
Yeah, I said
a "man", not a kid.

04:34.929 --> 04:37.449
Oh, George...
Look, Weezy,
the answer's no.

04:37.587 --> 04:40.832
George, Marcus is
from our old neighborhood.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.558
So is Wilbur the Wino.

04:42.696 --> 04:44.456
I ain't hiring
him either.

04:46.251 --> 04:48.391
Marcus really
needs the job.

04:48.529 --> 04:50.048
And you'll like him
once you meet him.

04:50.186 --> 04:52.464
No, I won't,
'cause I ain't gonna
never meet him.

04:52.602 --> 04:54.811
Well, he's gonna
be here soon.
What will I tell him?

04:54.949 --> 04:56.572
Tell him goodbye.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.090
George, please...
Look, Weezy,
the answer's no.

04:58.228 --> 04:59.540
I don't wanna talk
no more about it.

04:59.678 --> 05:00.679
What you two
arguing about?

05:00.817 --> 05:03.130
Something you don't know
nothin' about. Work.

05:09.205 --> 05:12.208
George, about Marcus...
No! And that's final, Weez!

05:13.761 --> 05:15.280
Okay.

05:15.418 --> 05:17.903
But it's a shame
you're gonna miss out
on such a good deal.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.353
Yeah, well,
that's what...

05:20.112 --> 05:21.700
What good deal?

05:21.838 --> 05:23.909
You'd be getting
Marcus for half-pay.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.049
Say what?

05:27.119 --> 05:29.087
And the Help Center
would pay the other half.

05:29.225 --> 05:30.606
But since you
don't want him...

05:30.744 --> 05:33.125
Hey, wait a minute.
Where'd you get that idea?

05:33.816 --> 05:35.473
From you.
You said, "No."

05:35.611 --> 05:37.337
Yeah, I was just
playing hard to get.

05:39.615 --> 05:41.237
You were
very definite, George.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.170
You said,
"That's final".

05:43.308 --> 05:46.346
Yeah, Weezy, but
it wasn't a "final" final.

05:46.484 --> 05:48.175
It was more
like a semi-final.

05:50.729 --> 05:53.076
The money changed
your mind, huh, George?
Money?

05:53.214 --> 05:55.147
Look, I wanna help
a poor kid from
my old neighborhood

05:55.285 --> 05:56.528
make something
of himself,

05:56.666 --> 05:58.668
and you think
I'm doing it
for the money?

05:58.806 --> 06:01.050
Yes.
Look, Weezy, I don't
care what you think.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.569
I'm gonna do
a good deed

06:02.707 --> 06:04.156
even if it does
save me money.

06:06.055 --> 06:08.264
That's what I love
about you, George.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.578
You always do things
for the right reasons.

06:11.716 --> 06:13.165
That's the way
I am, Weezy.

06:15.029 --> 06:16.514
Oh, that must be
Marcus now.

06:16.652 --> 06:18.067
Well, don't just
stand there.

06:18.205 --> 06:20.449
It ain't polite to keep
my new employee waiting.
Hurry, hurry...

06:23.210 --> 06:27.110
Hey, Mrs. Jefferson.
Hello, Marcus.
Come in.

06:27.248 --> 06:30.700
Marcus, this is
my husband,
Mr. Jefferson.

06:30.838 --> 06:33.669
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

06:33.807 --> 06:36.396
Oh, I really appreciate you
letting me work in your store.

06:36.534 --> 06:39.571
Yeah, well I know kids
your age like to keep a little
change in their pockets.

06:40.503 --> 06:42.125
Right on.

06:42.263 --> 06:43.748
Whoo! Whoo!

06:43.886 --> 06:45.715
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

06:45.853 --> 06:48.097
Oh, looks like
your pockets are stuffed.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.134
This is some fancy building.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.620
You even got
a white doorman.

06:53.758 --> 06:55.380
Yeah, I'm stuffing
his pockets, too.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.143
You know, the last time
a white dude
opened the door for me,

07:00.281 --> 07:03.181
he was putting me
in the paddy wagon.

07:03.319 --> 07:06.840
Paddy wagon?
Oh, but don't worry,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

07:08.358 --> 07:09.877
That was the old days.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.121
And now thanks to you
and Mrs. Jefferson,

07:12.259 --> 07:15.780
I can spend my time
away from all that
jive in the streets.

07:15.918 --> 07:18.299
Well, look here,
working with me ain't gonna
be no piece of cake you know.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.267
Hey, I ain't
scared of sweating.

07:20.405 --> 07:23.650
Hey, and I'll be learning
from the champ of the
cleaning business, right?

07:23.788 --> 07:25.237
That's right.
I'm the champ,

07:25.375 --> 07:27.067
and there ain't
no challengers.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.241
When can I start?
Right now.

07:29.379 --> 07:30.829
Great!

07:30.967 --> 07:31.865
Come on,
I'll take you downstairs
and show you around.

07:32.003 --> 07:33.867
Well, all right!

07:45.810 --> 07:47.501
And tomorrow, Marcus,
before work,

07:47.639 --> 07:49.020
why don't you come up here
and have some lunch?

07:49.158 --> 07:52.126
Oh, that sounds great,
Mrs. Jefferson.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.059
You're a real
special lady.

07:54.197 --> 07:55.509
Oh...

08:00.514 --> 08:03.793
Yeah, it looks like
you found me a real winner
this time, Weezy.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.381
You know, I think
I would hire him

08:05.519 --> 08:07.314
even if I had to pay
all of his salary.

08:07.452 --> 08:08.936
You would?
Yeah.

08:09.074 --> 08:11.042
He reminds me of somebody
I've always admired.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.216
Who?
Me!

08:19.637 --> 08:22.329
Oh, hello, Mr. Jefferson.
Hi, Clara.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.331
Clara, this is Marcus.
Marcus, Clara Jackson.

08:24.469 --> 08:25.574
How you doing?
How you doing?

08:25.712 --> 08:26.816
He's gonna be
working for us part-time.

08:26.954 --> 08:28.438
Oh, good for you.

08:28.577 --> 08:29.854
Come on, let me
show you the back room.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.580
Nice to meet you,
Miss Jackson.

08:33.271 --> 08:36.136
This is where we hang
the clothes when they
come back from the plant.

08:36.274 --> 08:37.309
And you know
what this is?

08:38.794 --> 08:40.796
Huh?
This machine here.

08:41.969 --> 08:43.868
Oh, no, uh,
oh, what is it?

08:44.006 --> 08:46.146
A pressing machine,
latest model.

08:48.389 --> 08:50.737
I got to hand it to you,
Mr. Jefferson.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.360
This is the finest
cleaning operation
I have ever seen.

08:53.498 --> 08:54.844
Yeah, well...

08:54.982 --> 08:57.019
Of course,
it's the only one
I've ever seen, too.

08:58.883 --> 09:01.679
You know, I sure could
dig on having a store
like this someday.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.439
Yeah, well,
it just might happen.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.476
But just make sure
you don't open it
across the street from mine.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.720
Could you get that,
Mr. Jefferson, please?

09:08.858 --> 09:10.653
Sure, Clara.

09:10.791 --> 09:14.036
Come on, Marcus, let me
show you how to handle
a customer Jefferson style.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.728
Hello, Mr. J.
Hi, Mr. Bentley,
what can I do for you?

09:16.866 --> 09:18.730
Well, I was wondering
if you could let
these trousers out.

09:18.868 --> 09:20.525
Sure I can let 'em out.
Open the door, Marcus.

09:24.874 --> 09:26.911
Oh, that's rich. Ha!

09:27.049 --> 09:28.775
Customers love it
when you got
a little sense of humor.

09:29.879 --> 09:31.191
How much bigger
you want them, Bentley?

09:31.329 --> 09:32.675
Oh, about an inch.

09:32.813 --> 09:35.126
I'm afraid I'm becoming
a victim of middle age spread.

09:37.024 --> 09:39.026
Ah, it seems only
yesterday I was out
in the old rugby fields

09:39.164 --> 09:40.649
darting down the wings...

09:40.787 --> 09:42.167
Bentley...
...weaving in and out,

09:42.305 --> 09:45.377
getting tackled,
pummeled,
knocked unconscious.

09:45.515 --> 09:46.862
My God, it was fun.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.796
But now I'm in
such awful shape,

09:49.934 --> 09:52.177
I don't think I could do
a deep knee bend.

09:52.315 --> 09:54.490
Oh...

09:54.628 --> 09:57.769
I've done it.
What did you do?
Tear your pants?

09:57.907 --> 09:59.184
No, my back's
gone out again.

09:59.322 --> 10:01.393
I'm afraid I need
your help, Mr. Jefferson.

10:01.531 --> 10:02.912
GEORGE: Oh, Bentley!

10:04.604 --> 10:06.882
Why don't you have
a back transplant?

10:09.436 --> 10:11.162
Ah!

10:11.300 --> 10:14.199
Oh, you do that
for all your customers,
Mr. Jefferson?

10:15.442 --> 10:16.788
No, just for
the weird ones.

10:18.169 --> 10:19.239
Is it better, Bentley?

10:19.377 --> 10:20.861
No, I'm afraid
it's not working.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.138
How 'bout if I jump
up and down?

10:22.276 --> 10:23.933
No!

10:24.071 --> 10:25.970
Help me, help me
up to my apartment.

10:26.108 --> 10:27.696
Perhaps a hot bath
will do it.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.906
Bentley!
Oh, bless you,
Mr. J.

10:31.044 --> 10:32.666
Look, Marcus, it's
almost quitting time.

10:32.804 --> 10:33.840
Why don't you
call it a day?

10:33.978 --> 10:36.497
Oh, no. I'll, uh,
stick around

10:36.636 --> 10:38.430
and sweep up
the back room.

10:38.568 --> 10:39.846
Oh, great.
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:39.984 --> 10:41.226
Good night, Clara.

10:41.364 --> 10:43.297
Goodnight, Mr. Jefferson.

10:45.783 --> 10:47.232
What's so funny?

10:47.370 --> 10:48.958
I was just thinking,
if you had a tin cup
in your hand,

10:49.096 --> 10:51.236
we could make
ourselves a fortune.

11:12.119 --> 11:13.742
Out of sight!

11:15.157 --> 11:16.814
Marcus, my man,

11:18.401 --> 11:21.542
you're gonna have
the baddest threads
on the block!

11:30.828 --> 11:32.726
Man, Mrs. Jefferson,

11:32.864 --> 11:35.556
it sure was nice
of you to invite me
to lunch.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.420
Oh, it was
no trouble.

11:37.558 --> 11:38.905
The heck it wasn't!

11:42.322 --> 11:44.186
I slaved two hours
over a hot stove

11:44.324 --> 11:46.153
cooking that pot roast.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.638
Well, it sure was
worth it, Miss Johnston.

11:48.777 --> 11:51.400
Mmm! You really know
how to burn a taste.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.264
Oh, it was no trouble.

11:56.612 --> 11:58.510
How do you like
your job so far?

11:58.994 --> 12:00.167
It's great!

12:00.305 --> 12:03.170
You know, some dudes
gotta pay to go to school,

12:03.308 --> 12:05.310
but I get paid
not to go.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.140
George hasn't been
working you too hard, has he?

12:07.278 --> 12:09.142
You jiving?
Mr. Jefferson?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.937
He's a great boss.

12:12.007 --> 12:14.319
You talking about the same
Mr. Jefferson I know?

12:15.769 --> 12:18.047
Skinny little dude
with the body
of Sammy Davis?

12:21.671 --> 12:23.225
And the mouth
of Muhammad Ali?

12:25.503 --> 12:26.746
Florence...

12:29.472 --> 12:30.853
Oh, hi, George.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.753
Hey, Mr. Jefferson.
Hi, Weezy, Marcus.

12:33.891 --> 12:35.444
Would you want
some lunch, George?

12:35.582 --> 12:36.928
No, thanks, Weezy,
I'm not hungry.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.861
You don't know
what you're missing,
Mr. Jefferson.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.450
Yes, I do.
I'm missing
a suede jacket.

12:41.588 --> 12:44.280
A brown expensive
suede jacket.

12:44.418 --> 12:45.834
You mean
a customer's jacket?

12:45.972 --> 12:47.525
Not just
a customer's jacket.

12:47.663 --> 12:49.320
Mr. Linder's jacket.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.632
Mr. Linder?
Yeah, he's Boppo.

12:52.323 --> 12:53.531
He's what?

12:53.669 --> 12:55.360
Ain't you heard of
Boppo's Burger Barns?

12:55.498 --> 12:57.328
You mean the home of
Boppo's Special Sauce?

12:57.466 --> 13:00.469
Yeah, ain't that
sauce great?
Yeah!

13:00.607 --> 13:02.333
George, we ate
there last week,

13:02.471 --> 13:04.335
and you said
you hated the sauce.

13:04.473 --> 13:05.992
Yeah, I hate eating it.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.510
But I love cleaning it.

13:09.996 --> 13:11.721
Boppo's one of
my biggest accounts.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.483
That lost jacket,
Mr. Jefferson,

13:14.621 --> 13:17.451
uh, ain't you got insurance
for stuff like that?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.557
Oh, yeah, I got
insurance for the jacket.

13:19.695 --> 13:21.697
But I ain't got no insurance
for Linder's account.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.010
Oh, that's
a shame, George.

13:24.148 --> 13:25.874
Well, maybe
it'll turn up.

13:26.012 --> 13:28.911
Yeah, well if it
don't turn up, Linder'll be
looking for a new cleaner.

13:29.049 --> 13:31.845
And I'll be looking for
a bridge to jump off.

13:31.983 --> 13:34.814
Oh, there's a nice high one
over on 59th Street.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.477
Ain't no toll charge
or nothing.

13:45.548 --> 13:49.173
Oh, come on, George,
it can't be that bad.

13:49.311 --> 13:51.520
Are you sure you don't
want some lunch?

13:51.658 --> 13:53.246
Did Florence
cook it?
Yes.

13:53.384 --> 13:55.179
Then I'm sure
I don't want no lunch!

13:56.697 --> 13:58.907
You know, if you
ever said anything
nice about my cooking,

13:59.045 --> 14:01.254
I'd drop dead.
Yeah?

14:01.392 --> 14:03.773
Florence, I love
your pot roast!

14:05.396 --> 14:07.053
Well?

14:07.191 --> 14:08.744
See? She can't
do nothing right.

14:09.987 --> 14:11.298
Well, I gotta
get back to work.

14:11.436 --> 14:13.369
Uh, yeah, me, too.

14:13.507 --> 14:14.612
Tomorrow, I'm going
down to that plant

14:14.750 --> 14:16.821
and check on
that jacket myself.

14:16.959 --> 14:19.030
Oh, thanks again
for lunch,
Mrs. Jefferson.

14:19.168 --> 14:20.411
It was right
on the case.

14:20.549 --> 14:23.069
Oh, anytime, Marcus.

14:25.761 --> 14:27.625
Uh, Mr. J,
how are you today?

14:27.763 --> 14:29.972
Awful, Bentley, awful.
Come on, Marcus.

14:31.491 --> 14:35.012
Oh, is something troubling
your husband, Mrs. Jefferson?

14:35.150 --> 14:37.359
Uh, yes. He's missing
a suede jacket

14:37.497 --> 14:40.086
one of his best customers
brought in to be cleaned.

14:40.224 --> 14:41.259
Oh, that's a shame.

14:41.397 --> 14:43.296
I remember how
terrible I felt as a lad

14:43.434 --> 14:45.160
when I lost
my new football.

14:45.298 --> 14:46.989
Oh, did you
ever find it?

14:47.127 --> 14:49.302
Yes. I was so upset
the night I lost it,

14:49.440 --> 14:50.786
that I went to sleep
and dreamt

14:50.924 --> 14:53.409
that it was behind
the sycamore tree
in our garden.

14:54.169 --> 14:55.998
That's incredible!

14:56.136 --> 14:58.725
It certainly is.
We didn't have
a sycamore tree.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.316
I thought you said
you found your football?

15:03.454 --> 15:05.318
Oh, yes, I had lent it
to my little friend.

15:06.526 --> 15:09.218
But what did that have
to do with the dream?

15:09.356 --> 15:12.049
You know, I haven't
the foggiest.

15:12.187 --> 15:15.121
But every time I pass
a sycamore tree, I wonder.

15:19.332 --> 15:21.713
Well, thanks for
the use of your
heating pad, Mrs. J.

15:21.851 --> 15:22.852
Oh, you're welcome.

15:22.991 --> 15:24.475
Is your back feeling
better, Mr. Bentley?

15:24.613 --> 15:25.648
Oh, yes,
it's fine now.

15:25.786 --> 15:28.030
I took a jog
last night and it felt...

15:28.168 --> 15:31.620
Oh, by the way,
I passed Mr. Jefferson's
new employee in the park.

15:32.172 --> 15:33.311
Marcus?
Yes.

15:33.449 --> 15:36.590
I didn't have
enough breath to
say hello to him.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.696
Come to think
of it, he...

15:39.904 --> 15:41.595
Well, I'll be
going now.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.563
Were you gonna say
something, Mr. Bentley?

15:43.701 --> 15:45.496
Oh, it's not important.

15:45.634 --> 15:46.738
What was it?

15:47.429 --> 15:49.155
Well,

15:49.293 --> 15:52.986
as I recall, Marcus
had a suede jacket
folded over his arm.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.989
Oh, wait a minute,
Mr. Bentley.

15:57.163 --> 16:00.407
You saw Marcus
with a suede jacket?

16:00.545 --> 16:03.065
Well, I can't be positive.
They all look alike to me.

16:05.861 --> 16:08.519
Mr. Bentley,
I'm surprised at you.

16:08.657 --> 16:10.831
Why? I can't
tell one jacket
from another.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.879
Oh, I don't feel
so good, Mrs. Jefferson.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.570
I think I'm coming down
with something.

16:26.261 --> 16:27.503
That's nice.

16:27.641 --> 16:30.058
It is?
Uh-huh.

16:30.196 --> 16:32.370
Well, maybe
I'd feel better
if I got dressed up,

16:32.508 --> 16:34.338
found me a nice
comfortable bar stool

16:34.476 --> 16:36.892
and waited for somebody
to come along and
make me an offer, huh?

16:38.066 --> 16:39.274
Sounds good, Florence.

16:39.412 --> 16:41.483
No, it don't!
I ain't that
kind of woman!

16:44.141 --> 16:46.626
Huh?
Mrs. Jefferson, you ain't
heard a word I said.

16:46.764 --> 16:47.868
Now what's eating you?

16:48.904 --> 16:49.939
It's Marcus.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.218
Well, what about him?

16:52.356 --> 16:56.187
Mr. Bentley said
he saw him with
a suede jacket last night.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.776
So? That ain't no crime.

16:58.914 --> 17:00.709
It is if it didn't
belong to him.

17:01.399 --> 17:02.918
What you talking about?

17:03.056 --> 17:05.817
Well, George is missing
a customer's suede jacket.

17:06.749 --> 17:08.441
Then you think
Marcus took it?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.926
Well, no, but...

17:11.064 --> 17:13.446
Then you think
Marcus didn't take it?

17:13.584 --> 17:16.656
Well, no, but...
Then what
do you think?

17:19.383 --> 17:21.868
I think I don't know
what to think.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.186
Hi, Marcus.
How's the job going?

17:29.324 --> 17:31.705
Fine. Except
for the work.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.052
Just jiving you, boss.

17:35.123 --> 17:36.779
Mr. Jefferson?
Yeah, Clara?

17:36.917 --> 17:38.160
I'm having some people
in this evening,

17:38.298 --> 17:40.059
and I was hoping to
get home a little early.

17:40.197 --> 17:42.716
Would you mind dropping
the register money
off at the bank?

17:42.854 --> 17:44.580
Ah, sure, Clara.
You go on.

17:44.718 --> 17:46.824
Thank you,
Mr. Jefferson.
'Night, Marcus.

17:46.962 --> 17:49.137
Hey, Marcus,
you pass the bank on
your way home, right?

17:49.275 --> 17:51.449
Why don't you drop
this off in the night
deposit box for me?

17:51.587 --> 17:53.279
Sure, boss.

17:53.417 --> 17:56.178
Oh, hello, Mrs. Jefferson.
Oh, hi, Clara.
Is George here?

17:56.316 --> 17:57.697
Yeah, he's
in the back.
Oh, thanks.

17:57.835 --> 17:59.147
Goodnight.
Goodnight, honey.

18:01.839 --> 18:03.082
George...

18:04.359 --> 18:05.498
I gotta talk to you.

18:05.636 --> 18:07.431
Sure, Weez.
Go on, Marcus.

18:07.569 --> 18:09.778
Don't forget this.
What's that?

18:09.916 --> 18:12.436
The register money.
Marcus is gonna drop it
off at the bank for me.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.783
Night, Mrs. Jefferson.
Night, boss.

18:14.921 --> 18:17.165
George...
Uh, Marcus, wait.

18:17.303 --> 18:18.718
Yes, Mrs. Jefferson?

18:18.856 --> 18:20.754
Weezy, I thought
you wanted to talk
to me about something?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.102
Uh, I do. But...
Well?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.762
Uh, there's something been
bothering me all day today.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.143
And I...

18:32.249 --> 18:33.905
Marcus.

18:34.043 --> 18:35.528
Do you own
a suede jacket?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.601
No. Why?

18:39.739 --> 18:42.914
Well, Mr. Bentley
said he saw you
carrying one last night.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.332
Oh, you mean
that English dude?

18:46.470 --> 18:48.989
Oh, he must be
jiving you,
Mrs. Jefferson.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.337
One thing Bentley
don't do is lie.

18:52.407 --> 18:54.616
What about you, Marcus?
Would you lie?

18:54.754 --> 18:56.997
Or steal?
Wait a minute.

18:57.895 --> 18:59.034
Are you two
calling me a...

18:59.172 --> 19:00.242
Thief?
Yeah.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.071
The thief
who came to lunch.

19:05.316 --> 19:06.766
All right,
that's it.

19:06.904 --> 19:08.595
I don't need this!

19:09.769 --> 19:11.046
I quit!

19:11.840 --> 19:13.082
Marcus!

19:14.291 --> 19:17.121
Tell me the truth.
Did you take the jacket?

19:17.259 --> 19:20.469
Look, what if I did?
It ain't no big thing.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.782
Taking it is the only
way you're gonna get
anything in this world.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.611
Ain't nobody gonna
give you nothing!

19:25.094 --> 19:26.130
No?

19:26.268 --> 19:27.959
We were trying to
give you a chance

19:28.097 --> 19:30.169
to work at a job to make
something of yourself.

19:30.307 --> 19:31.963
Yeah, Marcus, that's what
I don't understand why...

19:32.101 --> 19:33.586
Of course you
don't understand!

19:33.724 --> 19:35.760
You're the man.
I'm the man?

19:35.898 --> 19:37.624
You heard
what I said, jack!

19:38.418 --> 19:40.213
Oh, you prance around

19:40.351 --> 19:42.042
looking black
and acting black.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.252
But you ain't nothing,
but the man.

19:44.390 --> 19:47.358
I'm the man.
Well, look, boy...

19:54.089 --> 19:56.781
I busted my tail
for everything I got!

19:56.919 --> 19:59.715
Yeah, well now
you got it and
you one of 'em.

19:59.853 --> 20:01.786
You ain't one of us.

20:01.924 --> 20:04.306
I mean, when was
the last time
you was up town?

20:05.273 --> 20:06.929
When was the last time
you sat on a stoop

20:07.067 --> 20:09.932
till two in the morning,
'cause it was
too hot to sit inside?

20:10.070 --> 20:12.280
When was the last time
you opened
your refrigerator

20:12.418 --> 20:15.386
and wondered
where your next meal
was coming from?

20:15.524 --> 20:16.939
You ain't
one of us!

20:17.077 --> 20:19.459
Don't you tell us
about being poor!

20:20.391 --> 20:22.462
When George and
I were first married,

20:22.600 --> 20:24.464
we lived on
mayonnaise sandwiches!

20:24.602 --> 20:26.155
Yeah! Without bread!

20:30.953 --> 20:32.921
Can't you read?
We're closed!

20:33.059 --> 20:35.130
It's Mr. Stockwood.
I wonder what he wants.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.338
Who is Mr. Stockwood?

20:36.476 --> 20:37.684
He's with
the school board.

20:37.822 --> 20:39.341
No, he ain't.
He's by himself.

20:43.725 --> 20:45.140
Oh, Mr. Stockwood,
hello.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.969
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.
Marcus.

20:47.107 --> 20:49.765
Uh, Mr. Stockwood,
this is my husband, George.

20:49.903 --> 20:52.492
Well, nice to meet you,
Mr. Jefferson.
Hi.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.874
I just stopped by
to see how your work
study program was going.

20:55.633 --> 20:56.669
How it's going?

20:56.807 --> 20:58.291
Well, you know,
when there's
something new,

20:58.429 --> 21:00.017
there's always
somebody waiting for
something to go wrong,

21:00.155 --> 21:02.261
so they can scrap
the whole thing.

21:02.399 --> 21:04.366
How was your first day
on the job, Marcus?

21:04.504 --> 21:05.781
Why don't you ask them?

21:07.335 --> 21:09.923
Uh, Mr. Stockwood,
the program...

21:10.855 --> 21:13.582
Well, maybe the program
wasn't a good idea.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.997
It wasn't?

21:15.135 --> 21:18.000
That's right, Stockwood.
The program
wasn't a good idea.

21:18.553 --> 21:20.348
It was a great idea!

21:20.486 --> 21:23.627
Marcus here has been
doing a fantastic job!

21:23.765 --> 21:25.629
And next week,
he's gonna learn how
to operate the presser.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.113
Then I'm gonna take him
down to the main plant

21:27.251 --> 21:29.253
and show him
how the whole
operation works.

21:29.667 --> 21:30.806
You are?

21:30.944 --> 21:33.326
Yeah, I'm gonna
teach him everything I know.

21:33.464 --> 21:36.018
About cleaning, that is.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.401
Well, it sounds
to me like

21:39.539 --> 21:41.955
your program could be
a big success,
Mrs. Jefferson.

21:42.093 --> 21:46.408
Uh, yeah.
It certainly sounds
that way, doesn't it?

21:47.961 --> 21:49.653
Well, I better be going.
See you all later.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.171
Keep up
the good work, Marcus.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.657
Uh, goodbye,
Mr. Stockwood.
Okay...

21:57.799 --> 21:59.663
What's your game, man?

22:01.285 --> 22:03.667
I mean, why didn't you
tell that dude
I ripped off your jacket?

22:03.805 --> 22:05.531
'Cause I ain't gonna
let you blow a program

22:05.669 --> 22:06.946
for Weezy and for
those other kids

22:07.084 --> 22:09.397
who wanna take advantage
of a good program.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.226
And I did it
for another reason, too.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.572
What's that?

22:12.710 --> 22:15.403
'Cause when
I was your age,
I was a lot like you.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.887
Only smaller.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.719
Yeah, I was hip.
At least I thought
I was hip.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.342
In fact, I was so hip
that I got busted

22:23.480 --> 22:25.413
for shoplifting
and sent to reform school.

22:26.621 --> 22:27.932
You mean,
you got sent up?

22:28.070 --> 22:29.486
That's right.

22:29.624 --> 22:31.177
And while I was up there,
I met a whole lot
of other hip dudes

22:31.315 --> 22:32.627
who thought
they were cool.

22:32.765 --> 22:34.801
And you know
where they are now?
Either one of two places.

22:34.939 --> 22:36.665
Either the graveyard
or jail.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.529
And the way
you're going,

22:38.667 --> 22:40.359
that's the way
you're going to end up.

22:45.053 --> 22:46.261
Where you going?

22:48.021 --> 22:50.161
You want that
jacket, don't you?

22:50.299 --> 22:52.371
Well, I'm gonna get it.
Just bring it
with you tomorrow.

22:54.718 --> 22:55.891
Tomorrow?

22:56.892 --> 22:58.446
You mean you're gonna
still let me work here?

22:58.584 --> 23:01.310
Let you work?
I'm gonna make you
work here!

23:01.449 --> 23:04.313
And you're gonna like it,
whether you like it or not!

23:09.629 --> 23:11.528
Right on,
Mr. Jefferson.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.254
Thanks.
Wait a minute.

23:17.154 --> 23:18.638
Drop this off for me.

23:20.088 --> 23:21.676
Go on, go on,
I trust you.

23:23.850 --> 23:26.128
And don't forget to
bring that jacket back.

23:26.266 --> 23:28.441
Oh, don't worry. I won't.

23:28.579 --> 23:29.822
It didn't fit anyway.

23:40.522 --> 23:42.490
Are you sure
you know
what you're doing?

23:42.628 --> 23:43.905
Trusting that money
with Marcus?

23:44.043 --> 23:45.976
Don't worry
about it, Weezy!
But what if he...

23:46.114 --> 23:47.805
Look, Weezy,
don't you think
it ever crossed my mind

23:47.943 --> 23:49.669
that Marcus might
have taken that jacket?

23:49.807 --> 23:52.085
You knew?
Well, not for sure.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.087
But I wasn't about
to take no chance.

23:54.709 --> 23:56.262
See?

23:56.400 --> 23:59.265
What's that?
Register money.

23:59.403 --> 24:02.268
Oh, but Marcus...
His bag is
full of newspaper.

24:02.406 --> 24:04.201
Me and Clara
set it up. See?

24:04.339 --> 24:06.203
Your husband
ain't no dummy.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.483
Don't be so sure.

24:11.346 --> 24:13.693
You gave him
the wrong bag.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.352
Hey!

24:22.426 --> 24:24.463
Weezy, don't get
so upset.

24:26.361 --> 24:27.845
He'll be back.

24:51.524 --> 24:55.632
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
