(FOOTSTEPS CREAKING OVERHEAD)

00:06.323 --> 00:08.853
Hm. That's the attic.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.379
No one's supposed to be up there.

00:11.404 --> 00:13.571
I know how to find out who it is.

00:13.606 --> 00:16.474
I just have to break out my trusty...

00:16.509 --> 00:18.476
Listen Up.

00:18.511 --> 00:21.445
I invented it to eavesdrop
on my brothers and sisters.

00:21.481 --> 00:23.947
Then I realized I'm not that interested

00:23.972 --> 00:25.925
in what they have to say
when they're talking to me,

00:25.950 --> 00:27.783
let alone through a wall.

00:30.289 --> 00:31.589
What was that?

00:31.624 --> 00:33.424
(SIGHS) I'll pretend it's not rats

00:33.459 --> 00:35.626
- if you pretend it's not rats.
- Deal.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.394
<i>Got a lot of room up here.</i>

00:37.430 --> 00:39.363
<i>Yeah, we should clear it out</i>

00:39.398 --> 00:41.465
<i>and make it a bedroom
for one of the kids.</i>

00:43.118 --> 00:45.641
Cleaning this out is gonna be a big job.

00:46.327 --> 00:49.501
- Let's start tomorrow.
- So glad you said it first.

00:50.107 --> 00:52.253
Someone's getting their own room.

00:52.288 --> 00:54.188
Gotta keep this top secret.

00:54.223 --> 00:56.090
If the other kids find out,

00:56.125 --> 00:58.125
there'll be
an all-out war for who gets it.

00:58.161 --> 00:59.560
And General Harley hasn't come up

00:59.595 --> 01:02.363
with her battle plan yet.

01:02.398 --> 01:05.333
- Who are you spying on?
- I'm not spying.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.101
Please.

01:07.136 --> 01:09.036
When you lie, you squint your eyebrows.

01:09.072 --> 01:10.338
Also, you're holding
a spying tool thingy.

01:10.373 --> 01:12.406
It's called the Listen Up.

01:12.442 --> 01:14.275
Fine.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.410
Don't freak out.

01:16.446 --> 01:19.046
But Mom and Dad are building
a new bedroom in the attic.

01:19.082 --> 01:20.114
What?!

01:20.149 --> 01:22.116
Keep this between us.

01:22.151 --> 01:24.385
If anyone hears, they'll be all over it.

01:24.420 --> 01:27.154
Right. Secret's safe with me.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.090
Mom and Dad are building
a new room in the attic.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.125
Mom and Dad are building
a new room in the attic.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.461
Okay, it's locked down.

01:33.496 --> 01:36.263
Mom and Dad are building
a new room in the attic!

01:36.299 --> 01:38.432
Okay, I had another one in me.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.437
Did you hear?

02:16.472 --> 02:18.372
Mom and Dad are plotting our doom.

02:20.309 --> 02:22.042
How did they know Mom and Dad

02:22.078 --> 02:24.245
are building a room in the attic?

02:24.280 --> 02:27.148
Yeah, that's the Diaz
telephone translation.

02:28.384 --> 02:30.384
No, knucklehead.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.386
Mom and Dad are building a new room.

02:32.422 --> 02:35.389
Oh, this is about a new room, not doom.

02:35.425 --> 02:37.324
I thought this was about a broom.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.161
- ETHAN: So what is it, Harley?
- Yeah.

02:40.196 --> 02:43.130

02:43.166 --> 02:45.499
Two-ply. Ooh, so soft.

02:45.535 --> 02:47.468
I'll take a couple sheets.

02:47.503 --> 02:50.204
And an explanation

03:46.562 --> 03:48.229
Okay, fine.

03:48.264 --> 03:50.064
I overheard Mom and Dad.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.166
They're turning the attic
into an extra bedroom.

03:52.201 --> 03:55.102
(ALL CHEERING)

03:55.137 --> 03:57.471
Having my own room would be so sweet.

03:57.507 --> 04:00.140
I could make a soundproof
recording studio.

04:00.176 --> 04:02.109
I like the soundproof part,

04:02.144 --> 04:04.345
but I have a much better idea
for my room.

04:04.380 --> 04:07.081
You've heard of a walk-in closet.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.083
Live-in closet.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.018
I'd go a completely different way.

04:11.053 --> 04:12.319
Indoor basketball court.

04:12.355 --> 04:15.122
With those low ceilings,
I'll be dunking in no time.

04:15.157 --> 04:19.159
Beast and I would be doing
the obvious best thing...

04:19.195 --> 04:22.162
wall-to-all waterbed!

04:22.198 --> 04:24.331
Or fruit punch beds;
we're still deciding.

04:24.367 --> 04:27.034
Count me out.

04:27.069 --> 04:29.270
I already own a house.

04:29.305 --> 04:31.205
Not looking to downsize to an attic.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.406
GEORGIE: It should be my room.

04:32.441 --> 04:35.042

04:35.077 --> 04:37.244
Guys. Guys!

04:37.280 --> 04:39.346
We all have big ideas.

04:39.382 --> 04:42.182
But we have to let
Mom and Dad come to a decision

04:42.218 --> 04:44.184
on their own and not bug them.

04:44.220 --> 04:48.489
Otherwise, it'll be
the dirt bike all over again.

04:51.227 --> 04:52.359
We fought over it so much,

04:52.395 --> 04:54.061
on the way home from the store,

04:54.096 --> 04:55.429
Dad turned around to bring it back.

04:55.464 --> 04:58.132
I remember that. He got store credit,

04:58.167 --> 04:59.266
and then bought mulch.

04:59.302 --> 05:01.368
And seven rakes.

05:01.404 --> 05:04.305
That Saturday took an ugly turn.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.107
Which is why we have to play it cool.

05:07.143 --> 05:10.344
There's no way
these jokers will play it cool.

05:10.379 --> 05:13.047
They'll drive Mom and Dad crazy,

05:13.082 --> 05:15.049
and take themselves out of the running.

05:15.084 --> 05:16.350
Then I'll sweep in and get the attic

05:16.385 --> 05:18.385

We need to stay out of it.

05:40.376 --> 05:43.410
Exactly. Let Mom and Dad
decide on their own.

05:45.314 --> 05:47.381
I don't mean to bug you, but I
know about the room in the attic.

05:47.416 --> 05:50.150
I think we can all agree,

05:50.186 --> 05:51.385
I deserve it.

05:53.289 --> 05:55.522
I deserve it.

05:55.558 --> 05:57.491
I deserve it.

05:57.526 --> 05:59.059
We deserve it.

06:00.262 --> 06:02.096
- I deserve it.
- I deserve it.

06:02.131 --> 06:04.231
We deserve it.

06:04.266 --> 06:05.299
- I...
- I...

06:05.334 --> 06:07.234
- We...
- ...deserve it.

06:07.269 --> 06:10.237
ALL: Deserve it.

06:10.272 --> 06:12.339
Yep, they're ruined their chances

06:12.375 --> 06:14.208
by annoying Mom and Dad.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.243
Now it's time for, "She's so patient,

06:16.278 --> 06:19.246
she deserves her own room
Harley" to make her move.

06:21.450 --> 06:25.152
Ooh, you've had quite a day
with those other pesky kids.

06:25.187 --> 06:26.387
Hot cocoa?

06:26.422 --> 06:28.122
Okay, that's it.

06:28.157 --> 06:29.423
Family meeting!

06:31.360 --> 06:33.460
I don't understand how word
about the attic even got out.

06:33.496 --> 06:36.230
You know, there are many
mysteries in this family

06:36.265 --> 06:38.232
that we may never understand.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.401
BEAST AND LEWIE: It was Harley.

06:40.436 --> 06:43.270
And since we were the ones who
reported her, we should get the room.

06:43.305 --> 06:46.240
Being a tattletale
isn't gonna get you anywhere.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.175
Then we got nothing.

06:48.210 --> 06:50.110
RACHEL: Come on, make a decision.

06:50.146 --> 06:51.478
Parent up.

06:51.514 --> 06:53.213
This is exactly why Daphne was called

06:53.249 --> 06:55.182
Baby Seven for the first month.

06:55.217 --> 06:57.217
Hey, the person before me
is called Beast.

06:57.253 --> 06:59.086
I'm glad they took the time.

07:00.189 --> 07:02.322
We can't pick. We'll be
accused of playing favorites.

07:02.358 --> 07:04.425
"Georgie's sandwich has more cheese."

07:04.460 --> 07:06.326
"Rachel's pillow has more fluff."

07:06.362 --> 07:08.028
"Ethan always gets the good fork."

07:08.064 --> 07:11.098
Why does Ethan always get the good fork?

07:12.234 --> 07:14.334
You know, let's just
forget this whole idea.

07:14.370 --> 07:16.003
ALL: What?!

07:17.206 --> 07:19.206
Oh, no, they don't.

07:19.241 --> 07:21.008
An extra bedroom in this house

07:21.043 --> 07:23.243
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

07:23.279 --> 07:25.279
I am not getting
dirt biked out of my freedom.

07:27.149 --> 07:29.083
If you've been paying attention,

07:29.118 --> 07:30.484
what I just said makes sense.

07:30.519 --> 07:35.055
Hey, what if us kids figure out
who gets the new room?

07:37.159 --> 07:39.359
You got an idea where everybody
get out of this alive?

07:39.395 --> 07:42.262
Uh, that makes things
more difficult, but sure.

07:42.298 --> 07:45.332
- And we'll clean out the attic for you.
- ALL: Yeah!

07:45.367 --> 07:48.202
Even though cleaning usually means
putting stuff in the attic,

07:48.237 --> 07:49.336
we'll figure it out.

07:49.371 --> 07:51.438
Okay.

07:51.474 --> 07:54.308
But only because we want you to learn
how to solve your own problems.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.310
And it's way less work for you.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.113
- And that.
- (LAUGHTER)

08:01.117 --> 08:03.250
I've developed an equation to
help us decide who gets the room.

08:03.285 --> 08:06.186
You take the number of helpful
inventions each kid has made,

08:06.222 --> 08:09.089
multiply that by
the grade-point average,

08:09.125 --> 08:12.092
and add number of roller
coasters built for the family.

08:12.128 --> 08:14.394
Now take your answer
and multiply that by zero,

08:14.430 --> 08:16.997
because that's your chance
of getting the room.

08:17.032 --> 08:18.999
This is not the time for in-fighting.

08:19.034 --> 08:20.434
Or math.

08:20.469 --> 08:22.136
Going from triple
occupancy to a single...

08:22.171 --> 08:23.303
what better time is there
for in-fighting?

08:23.339 --> 08:25.472
Georgie has a point.

08:25.508 --> 08:28.442
If we have any chance of that
room, we need to work as a team.

08:28.477 --> 08:31.378
Great. I have lots of
experience working on teams.

08:31.413 --> 08:34.414
Will this team have a bench?
That's where I thrive.

08:34.450 --> 08:37.484
We've been thinking
about this all wrong.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.220
It shouldn't be kid versus kid.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.322
It should be boys versus girls.

08:42.357 --> 08:44.224
Winner gets control
of the attic forever.

08:44.260 --> 08:47.461
I don't know. Boys versus girls?

08:47.496 --> 08:50.164
First, Rachel gets the room.

08:50.199 --> 08:52.466
Love it! Go, girls!

08:52.501 --> 08:55.302
Then when you go to college,
Georgie moves up there,

08:55.337 --> 08:58.138
and I stay here.
Everyone gets their own room.

08:58.174 --> 09:00.374
It's a win-win. Win!

09:00.409 --> 09:03.343
And that's more wins than
I've ever been associated with.

09:03.379 --> 09:06.146
All right, girls team, all in.

09:06.182 --> 09:08.315
We've gotta stay strong,
because you know the boys

09:08.350 --> 09:10.150
are out there working like crazy

09:10.186 --> 09:12.019
to come up with their own plan.

09:20.029 --> 09:22.996
Hey, what if we
teamed up against the girls?

09:23.032 --> 09:25.032
I move out, you guys get to stay here.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.234
Cool.

09:27.269 --> 09:29.036
That works.

09:32.174 --> 09:34.208
Oh, I was just coming to see you.

09:34.243 --> 09:37.044
And I you. The boys have a proposal.

09:37.079 --> 09:39.413
I assume you're authorized to
negotiate on their behalf.

09:41.150 --> 09:42.449
I want to be team captain.

09:42.484 --> 09:45.185
I second it. Two votes to one.

09:45.221 --> 09:47.354
- Lewie it is.
- I need a twin.

09:51.493 --> 09:54.261
I am. The boys would like to
team up and challenge the girls

09:54.296 --> 09:56.163
for control of the attic.

09:56.198 --> 09:57.297
The girls agree.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.233
We suggest a test of intelligence.

09:59.268 --> 10:01.268
We decline.

10:01.303 --> 10:04.104
We suggest that we should
all go into the closet and fart.

10:04.139 --> 10:06.173
Last one to leave wins.

10:06.208 --> 10:07.507
We decline.

10:07.543 --> 10:09.209
Dad says we have to
come out of this alive.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.479
How about a series of
backyard competitions?

10:12.514 --> 10:15.282
- Winner takes all.
- Agreed.

10:15.317 --> 10:17.050
(DAPHNE THUMPING)

10:17.086 --> 10:19.052
Does nobody have a bedtime around here?

10:19.088 --> 10:20.520
Keep walking!

10:23.525 --> 10:26.460
Let the battle for the new room begin.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.634
All right, the attic's cleared out.

10:37.669 --> 10:39.769
Now it's time to figure out
which team wins it.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.970
What sport should we play?

10:41.006 --> 10:42.705
Not hockey.

10:42.741 --> 10:43.940
Not soccer.

10:43.975 --> 10:45.775
Not badminton.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.545
I'm starting to see why Mom and Dad
don't want us to have a pet.

10:49.881 --> 10:51.781
The only things here that aren't broken

10:51.817 --> 10:53.716
are my inventions.

10:53.752 --> 10:54.818
Probably because
they're made out of stuff

10:54.869 --> 10:56.613
that already broke.

10:56.638 --> 10:58.205
Okay, I know I'm not
usually the idea person,

10:58.290 --> 11:00.357
more the foot soldier type,

11:00.392 --> 11:02.526
or to be honest, more the type

11:02.561 --> 11:04.661
to fill water bottles and hand
them to the foot soldiers.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.429
Just get to it!

11:06.465 --> 11:08.632
Is there a way to use
Harley's inventions

11:08.667 --> 11:10.400
for the competition?

11:10.435 --> 11:12.235
- Come on.
- Good idea.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.403
- That can work.
- Right? They could.

11:13.438 --> 11:16.506
I might be able to figure something out.

11:16.542 --> 11:21.344
Welcome to the Diaz Decathlon!

11:21.380 --> 11:25.348
Excuse me, Harley,
a decathlon has ten events.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.814
I only see three.

11:27.881 --> 11:29.948
We're all super tired
from emptying the attic.

11:29.983 --> 11:32.984
And the Diaz Three-cathlon
just sounds weird.

11:34.021 --> 11:35.287
Contestants from each team

11:35.322 --> 11:39.324
will be chosen at random
from the Honolu-loot.

11:39.359 --> 11:42.060
Each of the three events
is worth one point.

11:42.095 --> 11:45.931
No ties, winner takes all.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.133
And by all, I mean control of the attic

11:48.202 --> 11:50.202
from now until we all move out.

11:50.237 --> 11:52.304
Which, let's be honest,
is probably never.

11:54.341 --> 11:57.342
Uh, why is Daphne the referee?

11:57.377 --> 12:01.046
She's about breaking
the rules, not making them.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.282
I got no pony in this race.

12:04.618 --> 12:07.118
And I have the whistle.

12:07.154 --> 12:09.187
(SHRILL BLAST)

12:09.222 --> 12:12.557
Team captains, come out and shake hands.

12:17.397 --> 12:18.596
What are you doing?

12:18.632 --> 12:20.398
Psyching you out. Is it working?

12:20.433 --> 12:23.401
Not really. That eye booger
is killing your cred.

12:23.436 --> 12:24.602
Psych.

12:27.307 --> 12:29.307
Our first event is...

12:31.378 --> 12:34.612
Extreme tangerine!

12:34.648 --> 12:37.549
Daphne, give us the names
of our lucky contestants.

12:37.584 --> 12:39.517
Don't tell me what to do.

12:39.553 --> 12:41.619
You've got a long way to go.
Don't fight me every step.

12:44.658 --> 12:49.227
Playing for the girls, Rachel...

12:49.262 --> 12:50.562
and Harley.

12:50.597 --> 12:53.598
And for the boys, Ethan...

12:53.633 --> 12:56.167
and Lewie.

12:56.203 --> 12:57.635
Okay, in this game,

12:57.671 --> 13:01.239
Rachel and Ethan will use
my Magna-Wow electro magnet

13:01.274 --> 13:04.209
to launch tangerines
with washers in them

13:04.244 --> 13:05.443
to me and Lewie.

13:05.478 --> 13:07.512
We'll battle to
catch them in our baskets.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.214
Oh, by the way, did I mention

13:09.249 --> 13:11.182
the baskets are on your head?

13:11.218 --> 13:14.319
If this was a contest
for who looked the dumbest,

13:14.354 --> 13:16.421
I couldn't call it.

13:22.162 --> 13:23.194
BEAST: Come on, Lewie!

13:27.567 --> 13:29.133
Go, Harley!

13:33.640 --> 13:35.573
Yeah!

13:35.609 --> 13:37.375
A lot of families would do
rock, paper, scissors

13:37.410 --> 13:39.377
to make a decision. Not our kids.

13:39.412 --> 13:42.146
They're using fruit, not doughnuts.

13:42.182 --> 13:45.216
I consider that a parenting win.
Let's go.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.260
- Yes! Go, Harley!
- Boo!

14:19.185 --> 14:21.452
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:32.499 --> 14:34.165
Yeah!!

14:41.608 --> 14:44.475
DAPHNE: That's one point for the boys.

14:47.614 --> 14:49.514
In our next event,

14:49.549 --> 14:53.318
playing for the girls, Georgie.

14:53.353 --> 14:54.585
For the boys,

14:54.621 --> 14:56.254
Beast.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.523
- Yes! - You got it.
- I can do this.*

14:58.558 --> 15:01.259
All right, Georgie,
the boys won the first event.

15:01.294 --> 15:02.493
We have to win this
next one, or we're out.

15:02.529 --> 15:04.429
Don't worry. I'm an athlete,

15:04.464 --> 15:06.464
so I thrive under pressure.

15:06.499 --> 15:08.366
Is my eye twitching?
I feel like it's twitching.

15:08.401 --> 15:11.402
No, your eye is not twitching.
You'll do great.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.406
See, there you go. Sister power.

15:15.442 --> 15:17.275
No, I'm afraid
my knee's going to buckle.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.377
Oh, there it goes. There it goes.

15:24.317 --> 15:27.185
Everyone, it's time for Take Out.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.421
Take Out? I already
filled up on tangerines.

15:30.457 --> 15:32.390
No, that's the name of the event.

15:32.425 --> 15:35.193
Players will make their way
through a training course,

15:35.228 --> 15:38.196
taking out hidden targets...

15:38.231 --> 15:41.432
Using my 12-roll big-family
toilet paper dispenser,

15:41.468 --> 15:44.469
or, soon-to-be-patented...

15:44.504 --> 15:46.304
Strawberry Cannon.

15:46.339 --> 15:50.141
Players, choose your weapons.

15:50.176 --> 15:51.442
Hmm? Hmm?

15:57.517 --> 15:59.484
They call me Beast.

15:59.519 --> 16:03.254
Got the fastest
strawberries in the west.

16:03.289 --> 16:05.156
Too bad we're in the east.

16:12.332 --> 16:14.132
Guys, I don't think I can do this.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.299
I'm not that great at shooting things.

16:15.335 --> 16:18.136
Yeah, we've all seen you
play basketball.

16:18.171 --> 16:20.271
Focus. If you lose this,

16:20.306 --> 16:22.507
you'll be stuck
rooming with Rachel forever.

16:22.542 --> 16:25.143
Talking on the phone at night
when you're trying to sleep.

16:25.178 --> 16:26.377
Messing with your bobbleheads.

16:26.413 --> 16:28.146
Taking up all the closet space.

16:28.181 --> 16:29.280
Do you really wanna live like that?

16:29.315 --> 16:31.115
- No.
- I can't hear you!

16:31.151 --> 16:32.383
- No!!
- Good.

16:32.419 --> 16:34.909
Now go out there, think
about Rachel and the room,

16:34.934 --> 16:36.320
and unleash it on the battlefield.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.468
- Come on, Georgie. You can do it.
- You got this.

16:47.493 --> 16:49.493
- All right? All right?
- Come on.

16:49.522 --> 16:51.889
- Okay, Georgie.
- Go, go, go!

16:51.924 --> 16:54.759
Come on, Georgie!

16:55.493 --> 16:58.194
Shut down that phone, sister.

17:03.785 --> 17:05.411
- Yes!
- Yeah!

17:05.435 --> 17:07.368
Come on, Georgie!

17:09.724 --> 17:11.691
Get off my soccer bobble.

17:22.637 --> 17:23.737
It's jammed.

17:26.808 --> 17:30.510
Those are my hangers!

17:32.481 --> 17:33.680
Come on, come on!

17:34.883 --> 17:36.583
I don't know; it's jammed.

17:36.618 --> 17:37.751
Lunch is...

17:44.493 --> 17:46.559
Lunch is...

17:46.595 --> 17:48.918
disgusting unless you like...

17:49.131 --> 17:51.131
egg salad strawberry sandwiches.

17:55.237 --> 17:56.369
Enjoy.

18:00.409 --> 18:02.309
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

18:02.344 --> 18:04.211
Challenge goes to Georgie.

18:04.246 --> 18:05.378
Yes!

18:07.182 --> 18:11.318
DAPHNE: Point to the girls.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.156
That was incredible, Georgie.

18:16.191 --> 18:17.390
All we have to do
is win the last challenge.

18:17.426 --> 18:19.359
- How tough is it?
- Not tough at all.

18:19.394 --> 18:21.497
Are you okay with breaking
a non-essential body part?

18:21.521 --> 18:23.197
What?!

18:24.466 --> 18:27.133
The final event is a race
between the Slushy Bike

18:27.169 --> 18:28.468
and the Grocer-Whee.

18:28.504 --> 18:31.505
The Attic Rally 500!

18:35.210 --> 18:37.210
You're goin' down.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.478
No, we're going up.

18:38.514 --> 18:40.514
To the attic. Oh!

18:42.384 --> 18:45.352
As decided by coin toss,

18:45.387 --> 18:47.354
the boys get to choose their vehicle.

18:47.389 --> 18:49.322
We choose...

18:49.358 --> 18:51.258
the Slushy Bike.

18:52.294 --> 18:55.161
We are so going to win this.

18:55.197 --> 18:56.496
They chose a bike over
the thing with the motor.

18:56.532 --> 18:58.331
This is not that simple.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.400
The Grocer-Whee is faster,
but it's harder to control.

19:00.435 --> 19:02.402
Take it from the girl
who built them both,

19:02.437 --> 19:04.237
and only crashed one into a mailbox.

19:06.341 --> 19:08.141
I don't know why you get to drive.

19:08.176 --> 19:11.077
Do you think when
Henry Ford invented the car,

19:11.113 --> 19:13.146
his older brother made him
ride in the basket?

19:15.217 --> 19:16.216
You guys ready?

19:28.230 --> 19:29.429
Over-handshaking.

19:29.464 --> 19:32.332
You are begging for disqualification.

19:37.172 --> 19:39.539
First one around the track
and back, wins.

19:39.575 --> 19:43.176
Diazes, start your engines.

19:43.211 --> 19:45.345
Or pedals.

19:53.589 --> 19:56.423
Grocer-Whee gonna win!

19:56.458 --> 20:01.227
♪ ♪

20:01.263 --> 20:02.462
Oh, my eyes.

20:03.599 --> 20:06.099
They're shooting lemonade at us.

20:06.134 --> 20:08.501
- That's cheating.
- What are you doing?

20:08.537 --> 20:10.503
Turning off the speed restrictor
Mom and Dad made me

20:10.539 --> 20:12.172
put on this thing. Hit it!

20:36.264 --> 20:37.330
Yes!

20:37.366 --> 20:40.400
We're gonna hit something. I can't turn.

20:44.606 --> 20:46.606
Yeah, we're gonna win!

20:49.478 --> 20:53.179
I can't see! I can't see!

21:06.461 --> 21:09.295
- I may have celebrated too early.
- Yeah.

21:09.331 --> 21:11.264
What is this?

21:11.299 --> 21:13.400
Why do we have garbage bags of water?

21:13.435 --> 21:15.335
Those are our waterbeds.

21:15.370 --> 21:17.437
We've been collecting water
from our showers and our baths.

21:19.174 --> 21:21.274
So I have your shower run-off
up my nose?!

21:21.309 --> 21:24.344
No! Those bags were toothpaste rinse,

21:24.379 --> 21:25.545
and leftover pasta water.

21:27.549 --> 21:31.184
You can see why I was fighting
for that attic, right?

21:31.219 --> 21:33.420
So what happens now? Who gets the room?

21:33.455 --> 21:36.456
You guys should take it. We cheated.

21:36.491 --> 21:39.325
Glad that's settled.
Live-in closet it is.

21:39.361 --> 21:42.362
- Hang on. We cheated, too.
- Huh?

21:42.397 --> 21:44.230
I took the speed control off.

21:44.266 --> 21:46.132
And I cheated, too.

21:46.168 --> 21:47.500
I stole some things from your rooms

21:47.536 --> 21:49.202
when you were setting up the courses.

21:51.406 --> 21:53.306
I guess we decided one thing.

21:53.341 --> 21:56.443
None of us deserve the room.

21:59.548 --> 22:01.314
Guys, we appreciate the creativity,

22:01.349 --> 22:03.116
but for future reference,

22:03.151 --> 22:05.118
flipping a coin, one potato, two potato,

22:05.153 --> 22:07.320
all easier ways to make a decision.

22:07.355 --> 22:09.255
So what's the verdict?

22:09.291 --> 22:11.458
I mean, besides the fact you all
need showers. Who gets the room?

22:11.493 --> 22:13.293
We decided...

22:13.328 --> 22:15.095
none of us should get the room.

22:17.399 --> 22:19.232
We all should.

22:21.303 --> 22:23.303
That's gonna be a little cramped.

22:23.338 --> 22:25.271
For a bedroom, maybe.

22:25.307 --> 22:28.274
But we had so much fun
competing against each other,

22:28.310 --> 22:30.376
we realized we wanted a place

22:30.412 --> 22:32.512
where we could do that all the time.

22:32.547 --> 22:35.215
A family game room.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.350
A game room. Great idea.

22:37.385 --> 22:40.120
And bonus points for
all still being alive.

22:41.223 --> 22:43.490
And the first activity to break it in...

22:43.525 --> 22:45.225
ice cream party!

22:53.502 --> 22:55.502
HARLEY: <i>With a family like mine,</i>

22:55.537 --> 22:58.571
<i>it'll be a while before
any of us has their own room.</i>

22:59.283 --> 23:01.307
<i>But when you get right down to it,</i>

23:01.343 --> 23:04.144
<i>with a family like mine,</i>

23:04.179 --> 23:06.412
<i>maybe that's not so bad.</i>

23:06.448 --> 23:08.448
Okay, guys, on three.

23:08.483 --> 23:10.116
To our family game room.

23:10.152 --> 23:12.218
One, two, three!
