00:02.033 --> 00:04.667
Dating is tough, man.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.567
This one time, I went out with
this guy from Tinder

00:06.600 --> 00:09.667
who kept ordering me
glasses of milk.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.667
Another guy
I went off with off Hinge

00:11.700 --> 00:14.000
cried every time he said
the word "jazz."

00:14.033 --> 00:16.967
But the worst
was this guy from Bumble

00:17.000 --> 00:20.033
who cut off a piece of my hair
when I wasn't looking,

00:20.067 --> 00:22.033
and then again
when I was looking.

00:22.067 --> 00:23.700
Ugh.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.700
It's brutal out there.

00:25.733 --> 00:30.367
Sometimes, I think
I might just be alone forever.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.333
I just want to
find somebody and--

00:32.367 --> 00:34.367
and be done with dating
once and for all.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.700
Is that too much to ask?

00:37.067 --> 00:38.367
I'll be right back
with that guac,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.867
but not too soon,
'cause you frighten me.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.300
It's all right, Sarah.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.133
It won't be the first time
you were stood up.

00:45.167 --> 00:49.100
I mean, this guy's hair
is a bit much for me, anyway.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.967
Hello, my date!
Ahh!

00:51.000 --> 00:52.133
Sorry I'm late.

00:52.167 --> 00:54.100
I was telling my Lyft driver
about how free parking

00:54.133 --> 00:56.033
is destroying our urban centers.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.300
Don't you just love
talking to rideshare drivers?

00:58.333 --> 00:59.733
Ooh.

00:59.767 --> 01:00.900
You're funny.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.600
I like funny guys.
But let's cut to the chase.

01:03.633 --> 01:06.033
What's your deal?
What's wrong with you?

01:06.067 --> 01:08.233
What, are you in a cult?
You attracted to frogs?

01:08.267 --> 01:09.767
You're not a magician, are you?

01:09.800 --> 01:12.867
(swallowing)
Nope, I'm just a curious boy.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.033
Okay, well, you were late
and you're a weirdo,

01:16.067 --> 01:21.533
but we were 100% match online,
so we must be compatible.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.467
Oh, no, that doesn't mean
we're compatible at all.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
In fact,
there is no quick and easy way

01:25.533 --> 01:27.233
to tell who you're a match for.

01:27.267 --> 01:31.200
Hi, I'm Adam Conover and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:40.567 --> 01:43.600
What was that music?
What's happening?

01:43.633 --> 01:46.367
Oh, I have a TV show where I
deflate common misconceptions.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.233
Impressed?

01:48.267 --> 01:51.267
Well, I can't say that this
has happened on a date before.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.533
Huh.
For me, it's happened on...

01:53.567 --> 01:54.533
Every date.

01:54.567 --> 01:57.700
Well, take it from me.
Dating sucks.

01:57.733 --> 02:01.367
That's why I bit the bullet
and paid for this dating site.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.200
They use science to match you
with a guy worth your time.

02:04.233 --> 02:07.133
Yeah, sites like eHarmony
and Chemistry.com

02:07.167 --> 02:10.800
certainly love to advertise that
their methods are scientific.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.367
At eHarmony,
we use a scientific system

02:13.400 --> 02:16.600
to help you find someone who's
looking for someone like you.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.367
But their claims
to be scientific

02:18.400 --> 02:19.900
are straight up baloney.

02:19.933 --> 02:21.367
Where'd you get baloney?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.033
Oh, I brought it from home
in case it wasn't on the menu.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.700
But it's not baloney.
Didn't you listen to the ad?

02:25.733 --> 02:28.067
They have algorithms
and formulas,

02:28.100 --> 02:30.033
and the old guy
seems super "sciencey."

02:30.067 --> 02:33.767
Yes, he certainly does
seem that way.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.933
I'm Dr. Neil Clark Warren

02:35.967 --> 02:39.400
and don't I look like some kind
of well-meaning love grandpa?

02:39.433 --> 02:40.633
Yes.
Yes, you do.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.333
I trust you,
love grandpa.

02:42.367 --> 02:43.900
Dr. Warren founded eHarmony

02:43.933 --> 02:46.633
after working as a marriage
counselor and self-help author.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.033
That's how I came up with
our super scientific system.

02:50.067 --> 02:53.500
The problem is,
he's not a scientist.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.433
We looked and we couldn't find
a single scientific article

02:56.467 --> 02:57.933
written by Dr. Warren
on relationships,

02:57.967 --> 03:00.100
compatibility,
or marriage

03:00.133 --> 03:02.100
published in
a peer-reviewed journal.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.367
Didn't have time.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.033
Too busy getting
my cheeks dimpled.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.567
And there has never
been a single independent

03:07.600 --> 03:10.700
peer-reviewed study testing
eHarmony's algorithm.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.900
Well, then, let's get those
peers reviewin'.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.000
They would love to,
but they can't

03:15.033 --> 03:18.633
because eHarmony keeps their
exact algorithm a secret.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.333
Come on, let me in!

03:20.367 --> 03:22.333
If it's scientific,
why can't we study it?

03:22.367 --> 03:24.333
Sorry, bud.
Just trust me.

03:24.367 --> 03:26.400
We're a for-profit company.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.667
But we're number one
in most marriages,

03:28.700 --> 03:30.233
most enduring marriages, most--

03:30.267 --> 03:33.033
And the Better Business Bureau
told you those claims

03:33.067 --> 03:34.967
were misleading
and to stop saying them.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.733
The fact is,
without peer review,

03:37.767 --> 03:40.867
any claims made about eHarmony's
secret algorithm

03:40.900 --> 03:44.333
are unverifiable,
unscientific baloney.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.667
That's salami.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.400
Sorry, I ate all the baloney.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.833
Well, uh, I guess I'll just
use other sites

03:51.867 --> 03:53.800
like Match or OKCupid.
Oh!

03:53.833 --> 03:55.467
In the interest
of full disclosure,

03:55.500 --> 03:56.900
the production company
that makes this show

03:56.933 --> 03:58.900
is a corporate sibling
of Match and OKCupid.

03:58.933 --> 04:01.800
And OKCupid is so public
about their algorithm,

04:01.833 --> 04:04.333
their founder actually wrote
on their company blog...

04:08.200 --> 04:09.167
In other words,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.033
they're winging it.
(ding)

04:11.067 --> 04:12.667
Wow, um, okay, yeah.

04:12.700 --> 04:16.033
But there has to be something
in our profiles

04:16.067 --> 04:17.633
that make us compatible.

04:17.667 --> 04:18.900
Probably not.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.267
(trumpet playing)

04:21.300 --> 04:23.667
A major study found that
no matter which you use,

04:23.700 --> 04:25.667
there is no proof that dating
site algorithms

04:25.700 --> 04:29.367
are any better than
matching people at random.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.000
The fact is,
every match on a dating site

04:32.033 --> 04:33.667
is just a swing in the dark.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.700
Hey, encyclopedias for everyone!

04:38.733 --> 04:40.033
Huh?

04:40.067 --> 04:41.600
So it's random.

04:41.633 --> 04:44.367
I mean, how could these sites
be so off.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.500
It's because the only thing
an algorithm can do

04:46.533 --> 04:49.033
to match up two people
who have never met before

04:49.067 --> 04:51.667
is pair them on the basis of
personality and shared
interests.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.367
And the truth is
that those two things

04:53.400 --> 04:55.800
don't have a lot to do with
romantic compatibility.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.267
Uh, Sarah,
this is Benjamin Carney.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.833
He's a professor of
social psychology at UCLA

04:59.867 --> 05:02.633
and he is interrupting our date
for some reason.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.033
Are either of you interested in
these vegan nachos?

05:04.067 --> 05:05.800
I'm on a meat-only diet.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.467
Wait, you're on
the South Dallas Diet, too?

05:08.500 --> 05:11.100
Okay, Ben, could you explain
the difference between

05:11.133 --> 05:13.733
similarity and compatibility--
very quickly, please?

05:13.767 --> 05:17.033
There are countless ways
that we can be similar to

05:17.067 --> 05:18.733
or different from
another person.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.633
The fact that you happen
to match up with somebody

05:20.667 --> 05:22.700
on a handful of those interests
that you have

05:22.733 --> 05:24.033
doesn't really
tell us much about

05:24.067 --> 05:25.667
whether you'll be romantically
compatible with them.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.367
For instance, do you like music,
parties, and Mexican food?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.167
Yes, I love those things.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.033
(all)
So do we.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.867
Okay, point taken.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.933
I'm obviously not going to date
everyone in here.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.267
The extent to which two people
have similar personalities

05:40.300 --> 05:42.967
actually only counts for a tiny
percentage of their satisfaction

05:43.000 --> 05:44.133
with their relationship.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.033
Far more important
is how people treat each other,

05:47.067 --> 05:48.400
and how someone makes you feel
when you get to know them.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.733
It really is, in the end,

05:49.767 --> 05:52.000
less about who you are
than about what you do.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.533
So sorry about the mix-up, sir.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.700
Here are your meat nachos.

05:55.733 --> 05:58.033
Whoa.
Adam, gotta go.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.767
Got a lot on my plate here.
See you around.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.967
So even though
the site matched us,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.500
we may not be compatible at all.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.233
Afraid not.
So why did you use it
in the first place?

06:09.267 --> 06:11.367
Well, dating sites are
really useful for one thing.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.800
Helping you meet other people
who want to go on dates.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.333
You know, like, if you're an
eligible but shy TV host

06:17.367 --> 06:18.800
who's trying
to get back out there

06:18.833 --> 06:20.833
but is nervous to ask women out
in person,

06:20.867 --> 06:23.700
especially when
they're really pretty.

06:23.733 --> 06:26.533
But if you're expecting
a test on a website

06:26.567 --> 06:29.033
to identify your one true love,

06:29.067 --> 06:30.733
you're probably
expecting too much.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.833
Mmm...
I guess you're right.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.000
I did think it was weird
that we matched.

06:35.033 --> 06:37.633
I'm usually attracted to
alpha males, no offense.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.033
Oh, none taken.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.033
Especially since the whole idea
of the human alpha male

06:41.067 --> 06:42.367
makes no sense.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.367
Come on,
I'll show you.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.600
But we literally just sat down.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.667
We're not gonna eat or...

06:45.700 --> 06:47.367
Nah, I'm all full
on deli meat.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.433
Let's go!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.267
This bar.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.800
I went on a date here once
with a guy who had a pet rat.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.800
I have pet turtles.
Is that okay?

06:58.833 --> 07:00.200
Do they sleep in your bed?

07:00.233 --> 07:02.333
Only when I'm alone.
So, yes.

07:02.367 --> 07:03.333
(laughing)

07:03.367 --> 07:05.233
You make me laugh, Adam,
which is weird,

07:05.267 --> 07:06.767
because you're
not really my type.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.000
I usually go for alpha males.

07:09.033 --> 07:11.200
That's not weird at all,
because in humans,

07:11.233 --> 07:12.867
the very idea
of the "alpha male"

07:12.900 --> 07:15.267
makes absolutely no sense.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.733
What do you think
an alpha male is?

07:16.767 --> 07:20.533
A confident, assertive leader
who knows what he wants

07:20.567 --> 07:22.100
and always gets his way.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.867
You know, somebody who says
things like "get swole"

07:24.900 --> 07:26.200
and "Muscle Milk",

07:26.233 --> 07:28.267
and "Hi, I'm Vin Diesel."

07:28.300 --> 07:30.233
Oh, so like this guy.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.567
What up, freaks?
Name's Alpha Adam.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.233
I'm confident,
straight-up bangin',

07:34.267 --> 07:35.567
and if you think women
don't love me,

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
I'm gonna debunk
the F out of that myth.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.233
Attraction to alphas
is genetic.

07:40.267 --> 07:41.567
Comes from nature.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.867
I'm like the alpha wolf,
the leader of the pack.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.067
Hell yeah.
I'm bleeding.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.800
Well, all of that is wrong,

07:49.833 --> 07:52.167
because alpha wolves
don't exist.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.433
In fact, the term "alpha wolf"
was disavowed

07:54.467 --> 07:57.167
by the very scientist
who popularized it.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.900
The story starts in 1977.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.733
While doing research
in a national park,

08:02.767 --> 08:05.367
a wildlife biologist named
L. David Mech

08:05.400 --> 08:08.567
seemed to observe that one wolf
emerged as the dominant male.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.767
Ah-ha!

08:09.800 --> 08:14.233
One wolf is the dominant leader,
the big wolf daddy!

08:14.267 --> 08:15.900
That's the alpha wolf.

08:15.933 --> 08:19.567
(Adam)
He wrote a book on the idea
and it became a media sensation.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.433
Alpha wolves are real
and I love them,

08:21.467 --> 08:23.200
and I bet humans
are like this, too.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.600
(howling)

08:25.633 --> 08:26.833
(Adam)
But 20 years later,

08:26.867 --> 08:29.567
Mech tried to replicate
his research in the wild,

08:29.600 --> 08:33.300
and when he did, he realized
he had made a terrible mistake.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.233
Those aren't
dominant wolves.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.567
Those are mommies and daddies.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.067
Wolves don't have
an alpha hierarchy at all.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.933
They're just parents.
I must alert the masses!

08:42.967 --> 08:45.000
(Adam)
Mech renounced the term
"alpha wolf"

08:45.033 --> 08:46.900
and spent years
trying to get his own book

08:46.933 --> 08:48.400
taken off the shelves.

08:48.433 --> 08:51.233
Stop reading this.
I fed you lies!

08:51.267 --> 08:54.167
Alpha wolves aren't real!

08:54.200 --> 08:55.500
(Adam)
But it was too late.

08:55.533 --> 08:58.500
The term had taken on
a life of its own

08:58.533 --> 09:01.567
and we haven't
stopped using it since.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.567
So alpha wolves
are just parents.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.567
I guess my therapist was right.
I really do have daddy issues.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.967
Nah, nah, nah.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.300
Maybe there's no alpha wolves,
but I know crap, too.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.567
Alpha males are found in chimps,
our closest genetic relatives.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.367
Weird, you are more aggressive
than me, but also wronger.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.567
First of all, chimps aren't
our closest genetic relatives,

09:21.600 --> 09:22.900
bonobos are.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.233
And bonobos live in
a matriarchal society.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.267
Excuse me.
You're in my way.

09:31.733 --> 09:34.233
(animalistic growling)

09:37.600 --> 09:39.833
You're basic.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.000
Okay, whatever, those Bonobo
broads don't mean nothing.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.300
In chimps, the alpha male
is the most dominant,

09:44.333 --> 09:45.500
most aggressive bro,

09:45.533 --> 09:47.533
and that means he has
first access to food,

09:47.567 --> 09:50.233
resources, and of course, mates.

09:50.267 --> 09:52.700
Hell yeah, baby.
All right.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.233
Not exactly.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.233
Contrary to popular belief,
in chimps,

09:56.267 --> 09:58.800
the most aggressive male doesn't
always become the leader.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.867
Smaller,
more mild-mannered males

10:00.900 --> 10:03.200
can actually become dominant
by doing favors

10:03.233 --> 10:05.400
and obsessively grooming
other chimps.

10:05.433 --> 10:07.900
Excuse me, you seem to have
something in your hair.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.900
Thanks.
Oh...

10:09.933 --> 10:11.233
Hey, let me ask you:

10:11.267 --> 10:13.567
What do you think I should do
with my life?

10:13.600 --> 10:14.533
Wait, whoa!
What am I doing?

10:14.567 --> 10:16.200
Get off of me!

10:16.233 --> 10:18.233
I am the strongest,
most aggressive male,

10:18.267 --> 10:19.333
so I am the alpha!

10:19.367 --> 10:20.600
Now and forever!

10:20.633 --> 10:21.867
No, you're not.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.533
Unlike chimps,
human social hierarchies

10:24.567 --> 10:26.500
are constantly in flux,

10:26.533 --> 10:29.167
so you might be
the dominant male here,

10:29.200 --> 10:30.867
but if you were playing
Dungeons & Dragons...

10:30.900 --> 10:33.300
It's your turn.
Hello!

10:33.333 --> 10:34.867
What do you want to do?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.633
I attack
with my sword.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.667
Your sword?
You are a magic user.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.267
Do you see a sword on your
character sheet?
No.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.433
Well, then you can't attack
with a sword, can you, freak?

10:45.467 --> 10:48.867
(laughing)

10:48.900 --> 10:53.133
Unlike animals,
no one is the same type
of person in all situations.

10:53.167 --> 10:56.733
Human society is much more
complicated than that.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.133
So to say that
this guy is an alpha male

10:59.167 --> 11:00.867
or that guy's a beta male

11:00.900 --> 11:04.333
makes straight up
zero sense.
Whatever, nerd!

11:04.367 --> 11:06.533
The most aggressive male
gets the most aggressive tale.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.300
It's true forever
'cause it rhymes.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.933
Actually, research shows that
agreeableness, kindness,

11:10.967 --> 11:13.567
and generosity are among
the strongest indicators

11:13.600 --> 11:15.067
of a long, happy relationship.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.733
Aww, eat my feet.
Those are beta traits!

11:17.767 --> 11:21.300
Huh, well, then I guess betas
are the alphas of love.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.000
Enough lies.
I am the alpha!

11:23.033 --> 11:25.567
I am your God!

11:25.600 --> 11:27.533
Leave Beta Adam alone.

11:28.933 --> 11:33.167
You saved me...
Also, just "Adam" is fine.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.767
This sucks.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.567
I thought I figured out my type,
but just my luck,

11:37.600 --> 11:40.233
my type doesn't even
friggin' exist.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.333
At this rate,
I'll never find someone.

11:42.367 --> 11:43.567
No.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.567
It's just that people
are complicated

11:45.600 --> 11:47.900
and comparing us to animals
is a shortcut

11:47.933 --> 11:49.833
that isn't gonna
help you find a match.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.767
You can't put people in boxes.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.567
Our personalities
are too different.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.633
That's it.
Personality tests.

11:55.667 --> 11:58.167
Like the Myers-Briggs test.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.233
That's my shortcut.

12:00.267 --> 12:03.233
I'm an ESTJ
and since I'm a thinking type,

12:03.267 --> 12:05.400
I'm curious to know
what type you are.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.567
Oh, the Myers-Briggs test
is total bunk.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.567
Let me tell you about it.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.900
You are impossible.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.233
Oh!
Yo, bro, that's okay.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.567
That's okay.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
Yo, hit me up on LinkedIn!

12:23.133 --> 12:26.767
I normally have a two-location
maximum rule on dates.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.767
In my experience,
when guys move around too much,

12:28.800 --> 12:30.100
it's because they're married.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.100
Oh, I am definitely not--
Yeah, I guessed.

12:32.133 --> 12:34.100
Hey, what movie are we
gonna see?

12:34.133 --> 12:36.767
I'll see anything,
as long as it's not happy.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.767
I was thinking
something educational.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.100
Educational, Adam?
No.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.700
Is this because I brought up
the Myers-Briggs test?

12:42.733 --> 12:44.700
I will not apologize
for being extroverted.

12:44.733 --> 12:46.833
Already bought the tickets.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.367
**

12:48.400 --> 12:50.033
Even if you're not familiar
with the name,

12:50.067 --> 12:52.700
you've probably taken the
Myers-Briggs test in school,

12:52.733 --> 12:55.367
at a job interview,
or just online for funsies.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.700
It divides humans into
16 personality types,

12:58.733 --> 13:02.100
each with its own
cute little acronym.

13:02.133 --> 13:06.433
Okay, it says I'm an extrovert
sensing feeling perceiving type.

13:06.467 --> 13:07.767
I'm an ESFP.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.433
I'm an ESFT, which means
I'm a thinking type.

13:10.467 --> 13:13.100
And that's true.
I'm thinking right now.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.067
Except all of that is GDBS,

13:16.100 --> 13:20.100
and we use that BS to make
really important decisions.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.767
The test shows you're never
going to be an astronaut.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.100
Since you're an ESFP,

13:24.133 --> 13:28.433
I recommend that you
become a garbage man.

13:28.467 --> 13:29.900
Well, I accept my fate.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.100
I mean, how is it BS?

13:35.133 --> 13:38.100
The Myers-Briggs test
always seemed so scientific.

13:38.133 --> 13:40.067
Oh, yeah,
the Myers-Briggs uses a lot

13:40.100 --> 13:42.333
of science-y-sounding jargon,
but the truth is,

13:42.367 --> 13:45.000
it wasn't invented by scientists
at all.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.067
Take a look.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.033
**

13:49.067 --> 13:51.333
(Adam)
The year, 1921.

13:51.367 --> 13:54.333
Famed psychologist
Carl Jung has a theory.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.433
I surmise human beings
can be broken down

13:56.467 --> 13:58.500
into eight different
personality types.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.467
(Adam)
There was just one problem.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.733
This was a time
before psychology
used scientific methods,

14:04.767 --> 14:07.400
like data or controlled
experiments.

14:07.433 --> 14:09.467
So the eight types
were just guesses

14:09.500 --> 14:12.800
based on Jung's
personal experiences.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.700
My wife feels emotions
all the time.

14:14.733 --> 14:17.200
(Mrs. Jung whining)
Her type is a feeler.

14:17.233 --> 14:20.433
Welp, that is good enough
for science in 1921.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.400
But Carl Jung
didn't even make the test.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.067
Myers and Briggs
or whoever they are,

14:24.100 --> 14:26.400
they took his ideas
and made them better.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.367
Not quite.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.067
(Adam)
The year is 1943.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.400
Mystery novelist
Isabel Briggs-Myers

14:32.433 --> 14:35.067
and her magazine writer mother,
Katharine Cook Briggs,

14:35.100 --> 14:37.733
had a lot of time
on their hands.

14:37.767 --> 14:40.767
Mama, I'm bored of writing
mystery novels.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.033
Everyone else is off
having fun at war.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.700
Say, I have an idea.

14:45.733 --> 14:49.367
I just read some old Carl Jung
book about personality types,

14:49.400 --> 14:54.267
and I bet us two unqualified
nobodies could do a better job.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.367
Yes!

14:55.400 --> 14:57.367
Let's do some science
or whatever.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.367
Let's create an influential test

14:59.400 --> 15:02.700
that will be
widely used for decades!

15:02.733 --> 15:05.767
(Adam)
And so these two writers,
who had no scientific training,

15:05.800 --> 15:08.767
took theories from one of
Carl Jung's non-scientific books

15:08.800 --> 15:11.767
and came up with their list
of personality types.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.433
Ooh, my friend Carrie
is a such a Samantha.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.100
We have to put that in.

15:16.133 --> 15:20.100
(Adam)
Which, for some reason,
they doubled from eight to 16.

15:20.133 --> 15:24.100
And in 1944,
they published the thing.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.767
That's really where the
Myers-Briggs test came from?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.433
That's so... stupid.
Yeah.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.433
And Carl Jung
would agree with you.

15:31.467 --> 15:32.633
He once even said...
Shh!

15:32.667 --> 15:33.600
Oh, sorry.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.033
Like tiddlywinks!

15:44.067 --> 15:47.000
**

15:47.033 --> 15:50.367
Today, the test is shunned
by the scientific community.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.700
There's even a psychologist
on the board of the company

15:52.733 --> 15:55.367
that owns the Myers-Briggs test
who's admitted publicly

15:55.400 --> 15:57.200
that he wouldn't use it
in his own research.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.700
Harsh.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.133
But I still don't get
what's so wrong about the test.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.067
I can help with that.
David.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.700
Sarah, this is David Pittenger.

16:04.733 --> 16:05.767
He's a psychologist
and researcher

16:05.800 --> 16:06.933
at Marshal University.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.200
What are you doing here, David?

16:08.233 --> 16:10.233
I'm trying to sneak into
an R-rated movie.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.533
Sarah, the Myers-Briggs
type indicator test

16:12.567 --> 16:13.833
has a lot of problems.

16:13.867 --> 16:17.767
Foremost, it incorrectly assumes
that personality is fixed.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.767
Actually, personality is not
either-or.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.300
It's really more or less.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.100
So it's possible to be
introverted at one time

16:25.133 --> 16:27.100
and extroverted at another.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.767
I'm an extrovert!

16:28.800 --> 16:32.133
But sometimes, I like to stay
at home and read in the bath.

16:32.167 --> 16:35.600
Nearly half the people who
retake the Myers-Briggs
type indicator

16:35.633 --> 16:39.100
are placed into a different
personality category.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.433
Oh, no!

16:40.467 --> 16:42.100
Now I'm an introvert!

16:42.133 --> 16:44.700
But that doesn't reflect
how much I like yelling!

16:44.733 --> 16:46.600
(loud yelling)

16:46.633 --> 16:49.033
So, this test
isn't even consistent?

16:49.067 --> 16:50.533
This is garbage.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.167
The unfortunate truth is that
there's no evidence to support

16:53.200 --> 16:56.800
the 16 categories
created by the MBTI.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.633
It's nothing more than
a poorly designed,

16:58.667 --> 17:02.500
well-marketed way
to perpetuate stereotypes.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.200
Well, coast is clear.

17:04.233 --> 17:07.833
Thanks, David.
Have fun in the movie.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.933
My high school guidance
counselor almost convinced me

17:09.967 --> 17:12.433
to be a travel agent
because of this test.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.067
Why did I believe this?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.767
Because of the Forer effect.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.733
It's a psychological phenomenon
where people will believe

17:18.767 --> 17:20.733
a vague and general description
of their personalities

17:20.767 --> 17:23.067
if they're told
it's tailored to them.

17:23.100 --> 17:26.100
It's basically the same reason
people believe in Zodiac signs.

17:26.133 --> 17:30.433
It says here as a Pisces,
I'm creating, caring, outgoing,

17:30.467 --> 17:33.767
and also sometimes not.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.100
That is so me.

17:36.133 --> 17:38.967
I can't believe
I wasted my time on this.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.533
Well, you're not alone.

17:40.567 --> 17:43.900
2 million people a year
take the Myers-Briggs test,

17:43.933 --> 17:46.267
and despite the fact that there
is no sufficient evidence

17:46.300 --> 17:47.800
showing that
it's effective at predicting

17:47.833 --> 17:49.967
job satisfaction
or compatibility,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.500
it's been used to make hiring
and training decisions

17:52.533 --> 17:55.633
in over 10,000 companies,
2,500 colleges,

17:55.667 --> 17:58.633
and even the State Department
and the CIA.

17:58.667 --> 18:02.467
You're our most deadly
operative, Agent X.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
But turns out,
you're a judging type,

18:04.533 --> 18:07.100
so we're putting you in charge
of party planning.

18:07.133 --> 18:10.700
Reminder: I like cookie cake.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.067
The truth is, the Myers-Briggs
test is just a parlor game.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.167
It can't diagnose
your personality,

18:18.200 --> 18:19.733
it can't find you the right job,

18:19.767 --> 18:22.233
and it definitely can't predict
who you'll be compatible with.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.400
I hate this!

18:24.433 --> 18:26.467
Myers-Briggs is stupid,
types are stupid,

18:26.500 --> 18:27.933
dating sites are stupid.

18:27.967 --> 18:32.100
And I guess I'm stupid,
for thinking I could

18:32.133 --> 18:35.100
figure out whether or not
we're compatible.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.500
Oh, I'm so sick of this.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.767
I'm just gonna buy a cat
and die alone like my mom wants.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.367
Are you happy, Adam?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.700
Of all my dates,
all the nightmares,

18:44.733 --> 18:47.100
this is the one
that finally made me lose hope.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.433
But I was just about to tell you
why there is hope!

18:49.467 --> 18:50.533
Oh, swipe left!

18:54.067 --> 18:56.200
Could be hard
to salvage this one.

19:02.133 --> 19:03.400
Hello, everybody.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.333
We are behind the scenes here
on "Adam Ruins Everything."

19:05.367 --> 19:07.467
I'm here with David Pittenger.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.100
So what brought you
to study the Myers-Briggs?

19:09.133 --> 19:10.333
Interestingly enough,

19:10.367 --> 19:12.767
it was my first
academic position.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.433
The dean called me aside and
said, as a new faculty member,

19:15.467 --> 19:18.100
I'd like you to take the MBTI
because it will teach you

19:18.133 --> 19:21.100
what type of teacher you are,
and then you will learn about

19:21.133 --> 19:22.800
your students
and how they learn,

19:22.833 --> 19:25.100
and that all the students
had taken the test.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.633
And so I would be given
their personality profile,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.900
I would know how to tailor my
teaching...

19:29.933 --> 19:31.100
Really?
...to their learning style.

19:31.133 --> 19:33.100
And I said,
with all due respect,

19:33.133 --> 19:34.767
I can't take it
because it would be

19:34.800 --> 19:36.433
an implicit endorsement
of the test,

19:36.467 --> 19:38.100
which I do not
consider to be valid.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.100
Right, it's sort of crazy
on the face of it

19:40.133 --> 19:42.767
that a single test could be used
to tell a student,

19:42.800 --> 19:45.800
oh, do or don't study
this or that field,

19:45.833 --> 19:47.967
'cause that really affects
people's lives.
Yes.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.433
I mean, it's one thing
to take the test on,

19:49.467 --> 19:50.933
you know, Buzzfeed or whatever,

19:50.967 --> 19:53.100
but it's another to use it

19:53.133 --> 19:55.100
to filter people
or other things like that.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.100
Yes, that would be
what I would consider

19:57.133 --> 19:59.633
a capricious
and prejudicial decision.

19:59.667 --> 20:03.433
The real problem becomes when
a person will begin to say,

20:03.467 --> 20:06.100
well, I'm introverted,
which means I really shouldn't

20:06.133 --> 20:07.767
be doing these sorts of things.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.433
Or, I'm a feeling
type of person.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.767
I'm never going to be able
to be successful

20:11.800 --> 20:13.800
at this sort of tactic.
Yeah.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.433
Or the converse, which I think
is far more problematic,

20:16.467 --> 20:20.833
when somebody administers the
test as a job-screening device.

20:20.867 --> 20:23.100
I know some
very extroverted accountants

20:23.133 --> 20:25.433
and I know some very introverted
car salesmen.

20:25.467 --> 20:28.100
Behavior is extremely flexible
and people can

20:28.133 --> 20:30.800
accommodate themselves to
whatever situation they're in.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.133
Well, we will be right back with
more "Adam Ruins Everything",

20:33.167 --> 20:34.733
and more David Pittenger
right after this.

20:41.267 --> 20:42.433
Well, I am back
behind the scenes

20:42.467 --> 20:43.467
on "Adam Ruins Everything."

20:43.500 --> 20:45.233
I'm here with David Pittenger
to talk more

20:45.267 --> 20:47.333
about the Myers-Briggs test.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.533
Okay, well,
I do have to ask,

20:48.567 --> 20:51.367
what is your four-letter
personality type?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.233
PITA.
Ahh, I love that.

20:53.267 --> 20:55.400
You're a PITA,
that's wonderful.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.900
I think
to the Myers-Briggs people,

20:56.933 --> 20:58.500
you are a pain in the ass,
I would imagine.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.633
I make it a letter.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.267
What do you say to people
who have taken this test

21:02.300 --> 21:03.967
'cause they saw it on Facebook
or whatever and it--

21:04.000 --> 21:05.733
you know, gave them their
personality type and they said,

21:05.767 --> 21:08.367
"Oh, wow, this really helped me
understand myself"?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.933
I know people like that
who feel like they've gotten

21:09.967 --> 21:12.000
a real self-knowledge
from the test.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.600
And that's a good thing.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.600
As a psychologist,
I think that any time a person

21:15.633 --> 21:18.267
can be more self-aware
of who they are,

21:18.300 --> 21:20.033
have a better understanding

21:20.067 --> 21:21.967
of personality dynamics
and the like.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.067
I think
that's a wonderful thing.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.933
So what's the difference between
some better,

21:24.967 --> 21:27.433
more scientifically accepted
tests and the Myers-Briggs test?

21:27.467 --> 21:29.267
One of the things
that we're looking for

21:29.300 --> 21:32.600
is what types of conclusions
are rational

21:32.633 --> 21:36.433
or reasonable to draw from
a particular set of data?

21:36.467 --> 21:39.467
All personality characteristics
are normally distributed,

21:39.500 --> 21:42.200
with most of us occurring
right in the--

21:42.233 --> 21:43.533
the center.
Oh, really?

21:43.567 --> 21:45.533
So most people, even on
introversion-extroversion,

21:45.567 --> 21:47.533
it's like a loop and they're,
fft, right in the middle there.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.000
Yes, that's why,
when people re-take the test,

21:50.033 --> 21:51.167
they're reclassified,

21:51.200 --> 21:52.600
because they were pretty close
to the mean,

21:52.633 --> 21:55.567
they took the test again and
they just wobble a little bit.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.167
And so it's not uncommon
to see

21:57.200 --> 21:59.567
people who change
all categories.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.633
It's taking a little tiny
variation that everyone has

22:01.667 --> 22:03.300
and it's calling it a type,

22:03.333 --> 22:04.633
and shunting people
one way or the other.
Right.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.967
Right.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.233
The MBTI is violating
one of the canons of statistics.

22:09.267 --> 22:12.500
It is removing information from
the data analysis,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.233
and so that's why
it ends up making so many

22:15.267 --> 22:17.300
errorful conclusions,

22:17.333 --> 22:20.300
because it doesn't recognize
the subtle differences

22:20.333 --> 22:22.067
among individual scores.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.300
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show, David.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.767
Real pleasure.
Really appreciate it.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.767
Thank you.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.733
Sarah.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.233
Are you okay?

22:36.267 --> 22:37.900
Adam, I'm sorry, I just--

22:37.933 --> 22:40.233
I can't take any more facts
right now.

22:40.267 --> 22:43.833
Just please hear me out.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.900
I know dating sucks.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.900
It's awkward and uncomfortable
to put yourself out there

22:50.933 --> 22:52.900
when you'd rather just stay in

22:52.933 --> 22:54.900
and read "The Illiad"
to your turtles.

22:54.933 --> 22:57.233
I was with you
for most of that.

22:57.267 --> 22:59.900
I know it seems like
a waste of time.

22:59.933 --> 23:02.033
Do you know
how I try to look at it?

23:02.067 --> 23:04.633
Every horrible date
and every broken heart

23:04.667 --> 23:07.533
is a chance to learn about
what you want in a partner.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.633
Yeah.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.633
Like, now I know
I don't like guys

23:11.667 --> 23:14.967
who wear shorts
on the first date.
Exactly.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.967
But personality tests
and algorithms

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
can't help you with that.

23:18.633 --> 23:21.600
But if you put the time in
and you just keep trying,

23:21.633 --> 23:25.533
eventually, you will find love,
because most people do.

23:27.467 --> 23:30.400
And I have faith that
that can happen for both of us.

23:35.933 --> 23:39.900
Adam, I know
we just met 21 minutes

23:39.933 --> 23:42.567
and three commercial breaks ago.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.567
And honestly, at first,

23:44.600 --> 23:47.233
I thought you were
kind of abrasive.

23:47.267 --> 23:50.567
But now I think...
Yeah?

23:50.600 --> 23:52.533
No.
I know...

23:56.600 --> 23:58.533
I don't like you.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.467
I mean, maybe as a friend.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.967
You're really smart
and you are a sharp dresser.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.267
But I don't like you.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.700
Not romantically.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.300
Oh.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.300
And thanks to you,
I know that's okay.

24:10.333 --> 24:14.300
You've taught me so much about
what I don't want in a partner.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.300
That's great.
Thank you.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.300
Adam, this date
has been great.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.933
I feel so...
Free!

24:20.967 --> 24:22.167
(laughing)

24:24.633 --> 24:27.300
Well, there's always that girl
you met on Wikipedia.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.633
She's definitely real, right?

24:28.667 --> 24:29.600
(electricity crackling)

24:29.633 --> 24:30.800
(nervous chuckle)
