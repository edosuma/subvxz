00:00.029 --> 00:01.276
Surprise!

00:01.870 --> 00:05.110
And my current husband is being
told he's going to be losing his job.

00:05.110 --> 00:07.310
What's happening to you?!
You're acting mental!

00:07.310 --> 00:10.230
You sound so surprised.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.430
You are good enough.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.910
You can do it.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.550
But you have to take your chance.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.710
Promise me you won't hurt yourself again.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.110
I promise.

00:19.110 --> 00:21.270
I just want to talk, if you'll let me.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.830
No, no! No, Finn, move out of the...

00:23.830 --> 00:27.590
Right.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.870
Kester Gill doesn't work here any more.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.390
He hasn't worked here since April.

00:31.390 --> 00:35.390
Why are you doing this?!

00:39.550 --> 00:40.990
You have until five.

00:40.990 --> 00:44.990
You may turn your papers over.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.030
RAE: I need to come back.
I wanna move back in.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.830
- DR ALLEN: I disagree.
- And I want the pills.

00:53.830 --> 00:54.950
The ones I had last time.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.830
- I won't recommend those.
- Well, they'll be in the file.

00:57.830 --> 01:01.830
No, I'm sorry. Not unless
I deem them necessary.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.710
I rang Dr Gill.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.390
Told him you'd come in.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.270
He said there was no need.

01:07.270 --> 01:09.550
- No need?
- For you to be here.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.110
What else did he say?

01:11.110 --> 01:14.550
He said that you'd been working your
way through your final few sessions

01:14.550 --> 01:17.910
but that, in his view, you
were ready to finish therapy.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.630
That's it, is it?

01:19.630 --> 01:23.630
He didn't mention the fact that he'd
been lying to me this whole time?

01:23.790 --> 01:27.790
Rachel, what happened with Kester
Gill was a huge disappointment.

01:28.830 --> 01:32.470
You've clearly had real difficulties.

01:32.470 --> 01:35.070
But the problems you're experiencing...

01:35.070 --> 01:36.790
troubles with your partner,

01:36.790 --> 01:38.550
questions about your future,

01:38.550 --> 01:41.230
issues about how you
look, your self-esteem...

01:41.230 --> 01:45.150
these are found in the
majority of people your age.

01:45.150 --> 01:49.150
You just process them differently.

01:49.950 --> 01:53.950
Kester thinks you're
ready to end therapy here.

01:54.070 --> 01:57.990
Well, then, we've got
a problem, haven't we?

01:57.990 --> 02:01.990
Cos I'm not going anywhere.

03:03.870 --> 03:07.830
Rae, shut the door.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.950
Well, you'll have more
time to yell at me that way,

03:09.950 --> 03:11.590
and I won't get kicked out so quickly.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.750
Well, you won't get kicked
out. They don't want me here.

03:14.750 --> 03:18.750
And you're just gonna try and convince me.

03:19.510 --> 03:22.030
We've got two more sessions.

03:22.030 --> 03:26.030
Oh!

03:28.830 --> 03:32.830
Let me see.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.030
This one's because of Finn.

03:42.030 --> 03:44.950
Before I found out he was cheating on me.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.270
And this one...

03:47.270 --> 03:49.670
Well, this one's because of you.

03:49.670 --> 03:52.550
And it's worse. It hurt more.

03:52.550 --> 03:54.270
These are just setbacks.

03:54.270 --> 03:58.270
Setbacks? Is that what you
just called them, setbacks?

03:58.390 --> 04:02.390
And finding out my therapist isn't actually a
therapist, what's that? Just another setback?

04:05.390 --> 04:08.750
- In March this year...
- Oh, what's this, Kester? Another story?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.870
- No, not a story.
- What is it, then?

04:10.870 --> 04:13.750
It's an explanation. Of
what's been happening.

04:13.750 --> 04:17.670
Rae, in March, they put all the
doctors in here under review.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.230
I mean, you name it... if you could
make it into a form, it was sent my way.

04:21.230 --> 04:23.750
Apparently, I became
difficult to work with.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.910
I was suspended, and even though
I was banned from the building,

04:26.910 --> 04:29.230
I kept coming back.

04:29.230 --> 04:33.230
Because of the duty of
care I had... to my patient.

04:33.630 --> 04:37.630
To the patient I care about the most.

04:37.950 --> 04:41.870
And, if I'm honest, to the
person I care about the most.

04:41.870 --> 04:44.550
But by that point, it didn't
matter, Rae, because we did it.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.310
You'd got there.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.230
You were ready.

04:49.230 --> 04:52.630
Yeah, and then all the bad
stuff started happening.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.990
Because of the work you did,

04:54.990 --> 04:58.830
it means you were prepared
for the bad things.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.030
Look, you might wish to
continue with therapy,

05:01.030 --> 05:03.310
but you can go to Bristol, trust me.

05:03.310 --> 05:05.150
Oh.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.990
If you don't believe
me, look in your diary.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.710
- The diary doesn't work.
- I disagree.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.750
It's all in there, Rae.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.870
I mean, I've never read it
myself, but I know the ending.

05:15.870 --> 05:19.870
It's about this amazing girl
who achieves all her dreams.

05:34.390 --> 05:38.390
Well, this is stupid.

05:40.470 --> 05:44.470

you were staying at the hospital.

06:32.950 --> 06:35.390
Decided to give it a go.

06:35.390 --> 06:37.590
Are you sure?

06:37.590 --> 06:41.590
Not really.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.870
Karim got a new job.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.670
It's in a factory.

06:53.670 --> 06:56.030
That's great.

06:56.030 --> 06:57.310
Isn't it?

06:57.310 --> 06:58.910
Yeah, it...

06:58.910 --> 07:01.070
means he'll be going away for a little bit.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.470
It's a bit too far to commute.

07:02.470 --> 07:04.362
- Why, where is it?
- Monastir.

07:04.363 --> 07:05.663
- Where?
- Tunisia.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.750
He goes at the end of the week.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.670
It's a six-month contract,
but he's allowed to come home

07:10.670 --> 07:14.670
for a weekend in the middle
of it, so it's not all bad.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.630
Oh, Finn rang to say he was sorry.

07:17.630 --> 07:20.430
I told him to shove
his apology up his arse.

13:19.050 --> 13:21.090

- And Karim will be there. You love Karim.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.570
- Why not?
- I just don't.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.330
You go on and on about me going off to uni

13:31.530 --> 13:33.290
and now you can't even leave Stamford.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.490
I've got to work!

13:34.490 --> 13:36.330
You hate work.

13:36.330 --> 13:40.330
I don't understand why
you don't want to go.

13:40.730 --> 13:43.810
I do wanna go to Tunisia.

13:43.810 --> 13:46.930
It's my dream.

13:46.930 --> 13:50.090
I wanna be a good Muslim wife.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.490
But I'm not going.

13:51.490 --> 13:54.810
I can't, because who's
gonna look after my baby?

13:54.810 --> 13:56.170
We just spoke about that.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.530
No. You.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.330
You're my baby.

14:00.330 --> 14:04.210
Who's gonna look after you?

14:04.210 --> 14:05.970
I'm going off to uni.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.170
Are you?

14:07.170 --> 14:09.530
Because we want you to go
to uni, of course we do.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.890
We even broke open the
non-alcoholic bloody champagne.

14:11.890 --> 14:13.570
But every day since then,

14:13.570 --> 14:17.570
things seem to be getting
harder and harder for you.

14:18.170 --> 14:22.170
I can't leave until you can.

What we need to figure out is
why you don't like yourself.

17:48.810 --> 17:51.930
We need to start digging deeper,

17:51.930 --> 17:53.370

It's about what you do when you are.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.890
Whether you can keep your head.
Whether you do the right thing.

19:03.890 --> 19:06.170
In the spring,

19:06.170 --> 19:09.690
I was admitted to a mental home,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.690
because I kept trying to hurt myself.

19:12.690 --> 19:15.930
KESTER: If I was to ask one of your
friends what they liked about you,

19:15.930 --> 19:18.730
- what do you think they would say?
- FINN: Our group of friends was...

19:18.730 --> 19:20.850
was nothing until you
sprayed Rae all over it.

19:20.850 --> 19:23.610
You're the one they always look to.

19:23.610 --> 19:24.850
You're the glue.

19:24.850 --> 19:28.210
KESTER: You see yourself
as a fragile thing,

19:28.210 --> 19:32.210
like a little broken bird,
sloshing around in a bottle.

19:32.850 --> 19:36.450
But, basically, I think
you're a pretty tough cookie.

19:36.450 --> 19:39.610
You don't think that people can change.

19:39.610 --> 19:43.610
But I know that they can.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.610

20:01.770 --> 20:04.010

20:04.010 --> 20:07.530

20:07.530 --> 20:10.570
So, without wishing to sound rude, Rachel,

20:10.570 --> 20:12.970

20:12.970 --> 20:14.850
Well...

20:14.850 --> 20:17.690
I need your help.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.730
I wanna go to Bristol.

20:19.730 --> 20:23.530
Decided I can do it.

20:23.530 --> 20:27.530
So, I was wondering if you would
be able to write me a letter,

20:28.130 --> 20:30.570
in case I don't get the grades.

20:30.570 --> 20:33.170
Saying what?

20:33.170 --> 20:37.170
Just saying that I would've got the
grades if I hadn't have been in here.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.210
I can write a letter,

20:40.210 --> 20:44.210
but I'm afraid I've no idea
what grades you would've got.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.330
Why the sudden turnaround?

20:47.330 --> 20:50.290
You seem so certain about things.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.330
But not so long ago,
you were just as certain

20:52.330 --> 20:55.050
you couldn't manage any of this.

20:55.050 --> 20:57.010
Kester says...

20:57.010 --> 20:59.410
that I owe it to myself to try.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.890
How are you going to do that?

21:01.890 --> 21:04.290
Well...

21:04.290 --> 21:08.130
... I've just gotta learn
how to handle things...

21:08.130 --> 21:12.130
on my own.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.690
I'm gonna stop waiting for
someone to come and save me.

21:18.930 --> 21:22.930
So, do you need this letter?

21:24.290 --> 21:26.210
No.

21:26.210 --> 21:30.210
What does that mean?

21:30.650 --> 21:34.010
I guess it means...

21:34.010 --> 21:37.930
... that we're done.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.330

23:29.610 --> 23:30.850
Well...

23:30.850 --> 23:34.810
that's why I wanted us to get together.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.850
So I can explain why
I've been feeling the way

23:37.850 --> 23:41.090
that I've been feeling.

23:41.090 --> 23:45.090
OK, the only way that
I can describe it is...

23:45.370 --> 23:49.370
... it's like I'm walking
through a forest the whole time

23:49.930 --> 23:51.770
and, for the most part...

23:51.770 --> 23:54.170
it's fine.

23:54.170 --> 23:55.530
It can...

23:55.530 --> 23:58.410
be beautiful.

Peaceful, even.

24:00.810 --> 24:02.530
But...

24:02.530 --> 24:05.930
you always know that at some point...

24:05.930 --> 24:08.970
... you're gonna come across
these parts of the forest

24:08.970 --> 24:11.770
that you don't recognise.

24:11.770 --> 24:15.530
Dark corners that you didn't
know were there, but...

24:15.530 --> 24:17.850
well, you always kind
of knew they were coming.

24:17.850 --> 24:21.850
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

24:22.970 --> 24:26.970
And that's when the world gets scary.

24:28.290 --> 24:31.970
And that's when you can lose your way.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.970
But...

24:33.970 --> 24:37.930
because I've got great mates...

24:37.930 --> 24:41.930
and people who make me
strong and remind me that...

24:43.450 --> 24:47.450
well, even when I hit those
dark parts of the forest...

24:48.370 --> 24:49.610
... that...

24:49.610 --> 24:51.810
I've just gotta keep walking.

24:51.810 --> 24:55.810
Just keep walking, and I'll be OK.

24:56.570 --> 25:00.050
I'll be scared.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.850
But I'll be OK.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.610
So...

25:03.610 --> 25:07.610
you have to promise me
that you're not gonna worry.

25:09.170 --> 25:12.330
And you're not going to hate Finn. Promise?

25:12.330 --> 25:13.650
- Promise.
- Promise?

25:13.650 --> 25:14.850
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:14.850 --> 25:17.290
It's OK to hate Katie
Springer, though, right?

25:17.290 --> 25:20.210

- Definitely.

25:20.210 --> 25:24.210

25:25.730 --> 25:27.570

25:41.632 --> 25:42.752
Rae.

25:42.752 --> 25:44.192
Look, I just wanted to say,

25:44.192 --> 25:46.752
if Finn doesn't take
you to the leavers' ball,

25:46.752 --> 25:50.752
then I'd consider it an honour
to step in and take you myself.

25:51.952 --> 25:53.792
The only possible caveat

25:53.792 --> 25:56.632
is that I've made some inroads with Kelly

25:56.632 --> 25:58.912
who does the trolleys in
the Safeway's car park.

25:58.912 --> 26:01.032
So if she pages me back...

26:01.032 --> 26:03.312
I'd have to renege on my offer.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.552
I mean, I can't have blurred lines, Rae.

26:05.552 --> 26:06.992
Understood.

26:06.992 --> 26:08.312
Thanks, Danny.

26:08.312 --> 26:10.392
- Chlo...
- I told her, Rae.

26:10.392 --> 26:13.032

26:13.032 --> 26:15.392
Shit. Chlo!

26:15.392 --> 26:18.512

26:23.792 --> 26:25.912
Or is it this one?

26:25.912 --> 26:29.272

Chloe?

26:51.032 --> 26:52.752
I told you, Katie.

26:52.752 --> 26:54.632
I warned you.

26:54.632 --> 26:56.392

27:37.192 --> 27:39.912
Yeah. Yeah, I am, Katie.

27:39.912 --> 27:42.672
Because there is no way you
are anything like a proper mate,

27:42.672 --> 27:44.432

27:44.432 --> 27:47.512

Even more than if you'd
have got the right car.

28:08.592 --> 28:12.512

28:12.512 --> 28:15.832

28:15.832 --> 28:18.152
Chlo, can you do me a favour?

28:18.152 --> 28:22.152
Will you please try and
stop worrying about me?

28:22.152 --> 28:24.472
I know it's hard, because I am literally

28:24.472 --> 28:27.392
the easiest person in the
world to worry about, but...

28:27.392 --> 28:29.352
You've gotta try.

28:29.352 --> 28:31.232
Yeah?

28:31.232 --> 28:32.512

28:32.512 --> 28:35.472

Racy?

28:52.232 --> 28:53.792
Yeah.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.632
Well, racy.

28:55.632 --> 28:57.512
As in... racy.

28:57.512 --> 29:00.312
Oh, OK. Perfect.

29:00.312 --> 29:04.312
That's the look I normally go for.

29:07.712 --> 29:10.672
Oh!

29:10.672 --> 29:13.432

29:36.352 --> 29:39.032
I was a couple of sizes bigger.

29:39.032 --> 29:43.032

29:53.472 --> 29:56.352
Oh, Rae.

29:56.352 --> 29:58.752
I'll wear it.

29:58.752 --> 30:01.432

30:01.432 --> 30:05.112

30:05.112 --> 30:06.792

30:10.352 --> 30:12.272
You're his life.

30:15.592 --> 30:19.352

30:26.072 --> 30:29.792
Yeah. They are.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.232
But they'll heal.

30:32.232 --> 30:34.912
I am learning how to handle things.

30:34.912 --> 30:38.912
But how am I gonna know you're OK?

30:39.592 --> 30:43.592
You don't.

30:45.152 --> 30:49.152

31:53.152 --> 31:57.152
I don't know. I don't...

31:58.272 --> 32:02.272
I only got that because my dad
plays golf with the guy who runs it.

32:02.632 --> 32:05.032
And if I don't do that, then...

32:05.032 --> 32:09.032
then I don't know what I'm gonna do.

32:11.752 --> 32:15.312
I just know that I won't
get to do it with you.

32:15.312 --> 32:19.312
Chlo...

32:20.032 --> 32:24.032
Like... when you told me
to stop worrying about you.

32:25.712 --> 32:28.112
Well, I knew then that you were leaving.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.712
Yeah.

32:29.712 --> 32:33.712
Everyone's leaving, aren't they?

32:35.632 --> 32:39.632

32:39.632 --> 32:43.632
Well...

32:45.832 --> 32:49.832
It's just life, isn't it?

32:51.352 --> 32:55.312

32:55.312 --> 32:57.432
... we are Chloe and Rae.

32:57.432 --> 33:01.192
We're not the gang.

33:01.192 --> 33:03.872

33:03.872 --> 33:05.832
... then you can just come and visit.

33:05.832 --> 33:08.072
Yeah?

33:08.072 --> 33:10.272
Yeah, that'll be good.

33:10.272 --> 33:14.272
It doesn't matter where we
are or what we're doing...

33:14.392 --> 33:18.392

gonna be Chloe and Rae.

33:28.392 --> 33:29.752
What?

33:29.752 --> 33:33.752
I spent ages on this make-up
and you've made me cry!

33:34.312 --> 33:36.232
No, you made me cry!

33:36.232 --> 33:38.592
No, I was fine. It was you.

33:38.592 --> 33:40.512
Are you gonna go get ready, then?

33:40.512 --> 33:42.112
Yeah.

33:42.112 --> 33:44.712
And can I borrow some
eyeliner or something?

33:44.712 --> 33:48.712
- Yeah, I'll do your make-up.
- Thank you.

33:49.872 --> 33:52.232

33:52.232 --> 33:54.912
Oh, it's better now. I'll
take it off in a minute.

33:54.912 --> 33:57.192
It clashes with my dress.

33:57.192 --> 34:01.192

- Hello!

34:11.911 --> 34:13.911
Hurry up, knobhead.

34:13.911 --> 34:16.152
Right, let's do this.

34:16.152 --> 34:17.752
Er, wait.

34:17.752 --> 34:20.792
Er, I know things have
been a bit tricky lately,

34:20.792 --> 34:24.351
um... but he wanted me to ask, so...

34:24.351 --> 34:27.992
Uh, if Finn and you may be able
to be mates in the future...

34:27.992 --> 34:30.232
Archie, can we not do this now, please?

34:30.232 --> 34:32.672

kind of needs to know now.
