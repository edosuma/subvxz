WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.339
I don't think I fit in
here, but I'm not sure

00:05.339 --> 00:06.674
that I fit in New York
anymore, either.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.141
I'm kind of nowhere
at the moment.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.610
From the minute I
laid eyes on Didi,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.279
I just knew it was
something special.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.714
You know, kind of like
destiny or something.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.216
You're saying that Didi
is your soul mate?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.617
I think, I think I should go.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.352
The doll in that photo
is my mother.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.488
She left us 12 years ago.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.989
Turns out
that she's 30 miles away.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.691
LAVON:
 Now, I know you'll always
 love her.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.359
I mean, she's your mama.
 You have to remember,

00:25.359 --> 00:27.361
she left here
 for her own reason.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.398
(ship horn blows)

00:38.872 --> 00:40.408
(mouse squeaking)

00:41.809 --> 00:43.077
(gasps)

00:53.387 --> 00:54.822
Go.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.390
(groans)

01:06.234 --> 01:07.701
ZOE:
Uh, guys?

01:07.701 --> 01:08.536
We have a mouse.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.404
Dr. Hart,
always a pleasure.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.605
Lemon.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.840
Brick.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.008
Do you know who this is?

01:15.008 --> 01:16.777
Yes, I do.
Where'd you get that?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.179
Well, I found this box
of pictures and stuff.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.380
I think Harley
must have left it for me.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.149
And you're just now
looking in?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.716
You surprised?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.951
I just saw it.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.786
And what do you mean
"surprised"?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.821
Just, anyone I know
in your situation would be

01:27.821 --> 01:29.757
tearing through every single box
she could find

01:29.757 --> 01:31.425
to learn who her people are.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.427
Unless, of course,
she thought the whole world

01:33.427 --> 01:34.828
began and ended with herself,

01:34.828 --> 01:37.165
in which case,
it's perfectly understandable.

01:37.165 --> 01:40.234
I have been busy,
trying to get patients.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.702
Bye, Daddy.
Yeah.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.973
Well, you might find
an easier time fitting in

01:45.973 --> 01:49.177
if, uh, it didn't seem like
you were just passing through.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.679
I'm not just passing through.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.814
I've been here
for four whole months.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.816
Oh, and you still haven't asked
one question about Harley

01:55.816 --> 01:57.651
or have any idea
who's in these pictures

01:57.651 --> 01:58.652
on the walls.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.787
That is not true.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.755
Oh? Who's that?

02:03.056 --> 02:04.325
A president.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.193
Uh-huh. Which one?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.427
Zachary Taylor.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.361
Close.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.729
That's Harley's brother Jacob.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.930
I have an uncle?

02:09.930 --> 02:10.997
Uncle Jacob!

02:10.997 --> 02:12.200
Yeah. He's dead.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.734
See, to Southern people,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.437
who we came from
is part of who we are.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.172
You want to fit in?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.873
Find out where you fit.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.142
Okay, where do I start?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.344
You already did.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.645
Go talk to your aunt.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.648
I have an aunt?

02:27.648 --> 02:28.916
Huh.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.421
Mm.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.756
All right, man,
I'm out of here.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.058
Oh, uh...

02:38.058 --> 02:39.327
Never mind.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.295
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.563
Never mind what?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.432
Nothing.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.766
Look, I was just
gonna say that,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.668
uh, these two girls
I know are in town,

02:47.668 --> 02:49.370
and I got to work
tonight, so I thought

02:49.370 --> 02:50.938
maybe you'd want
to take them out.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.072
Okay.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.241
So why wouldn't I?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.742
Because then
I remembered

02:54.742 --> 02:57.110
that you don't
go out anymore.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.548
You mope around here eating
your cookie dough ice cream,

03:00.548 --> 03:03.116
pining over
some lost love.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.652
You know what? Nah.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.320
That's the old Lavon Hayes.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.621
I-I'm like this game room here.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.823
All new fun
for a whole new year.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.392
Time to carpe diem.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.993
All right.
Yeah, out with the past.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.094
I'm ready for anything.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.463
Well, hey,
these are the two girls

03:15.463 --> 03:17.498
I met at NASCAR last year--
the two best friends.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.766
The one's got the snake tattoo

03:18.766 --> 03:20.268
that starts on her
butt and somehow

03:20.268 --> 03:22.603
finishes up on
the other one's...

03:22.603 --> 03:23.637
No.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.840
Not that.
(clears throat)

03:26.840 --> 03:27.975
Your loss, Lavon.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.377
Mm.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.144
GEORGE:
 Oh, thank you so much,
 Mr. Pitt.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.513
That is great.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.249
No, you have no idea.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.918
All right, you have a great day.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.219
Yes!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.554
(sighs)

03:44.725 --> 03:46.560
Didi, look.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.429
I did it.
Oh, yay!

03:48.429 --> 03:49.830
You won your game!

03:49.830 --> 03:51.499
Not a game.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.301
Oh, I thought you were "X."

03:53.301 --> 03:55.235
No, this is the big box
superstore thing

03:55.235 --> 03:56.670
I've been fighting my dad on.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.772
See, he told me that Large-Mart
is buying land up here

03:58.772 --> 04:01.609
and they have such a head start
on us that we cannot stop them

04:01.609 --> 04:03.176
from getting enough land
to build a store on.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.446
However, if they don't
have a road

04:05.446 --> 04:08.582
so people can get to the store,
guess what, no store.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.083
We're gonna blow up a road?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.184
I love this job.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.487
No. No.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.655
No, see these-these red X's.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.957
They-they represent
people that I got

04:16.957 --> 04:18.892
to agree to not allow
commercial construction

04:18.892 --> 04:20.594
or building of a new road
on their property.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.095
And they stretch
in a solid wall from

04:22.095 --> 04:24.865
the lake here all the way over
to Federal Forest land here,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.867
which means Large-Mart
cannot get to us.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.068
And guess what, Dad?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.470
Game over! You lose!

04:29.470 --> 04:31.138
Wow, that is so smart.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.474
And I guess that little piece
of land right there,

04:33.474 --> 04:36.043
that's not big enough
to build a road, huh?

04:36.043 --> 04:39.146
What piece of land?

04:39.146 --> 04:41.214
Oh, no.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.850
No, no, no, no, no.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.318
I thought that was
a printing error.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.519
Okay, Didi, I need you

04:45.519 --> 04:46.887
to get down to the courthouse
right now.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.589
Find out who owns
that little piece of land

04:48.589 --> 04:49.823
before Large-Mart gets to them.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.092
Okay, and remember,
keep this top secret.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.494
(whispers):
I will.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.530
But, George, if you blow up
that road, I'm in.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.304
Didi.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.440
Oh, hey, Lavon.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.378
Look, you don't have to
avoid me all the time.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.879
I mean, we only
had one date.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.214
No need for things
to be all awkward.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.950
So let's just be
friends, okay?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.919
Friends?

05:18.919 --> 05:23.256
How can I be your friend when
I know you want to marry me?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.459
What?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.528
ZOE:
 Nice to meet you, Aunt Maureen.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.463
Thanks for seeing me.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.133
So...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.135
how are they
down in BlueBell?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.804
Still crazy as ever?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.672
I think that's fair to say.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.808
Like the Planksgiving
with their pirates?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.643
Mm.
That's why I
settled up here

05:42.643 --> 05:46.279
in Liberty, where Thanksgiving
is turkey and stuffing.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.548
I know, right?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.249
And Christmas
is the Great Beaver

05:49.249 --> 05:51.385
cutting down the town tree.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.786
And damming up the river

05:52.786 --> 05:56.089
so the Christ child
doesn't float out to sea.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.727
So, anyway...

05:59.727 --> 06:00.961
I really wanted to meet you

06:00.961 --> 06:03.564
and to learn about my family--
our family.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.799
You didn't come
to Harley's funeral.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.768
I didn't know he was dead.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.102
Or alive.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.538
My, you are full of excuses.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.272
I visit his grave.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.074
Yes, I'm sure
that cheers him up.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.375
Do you talk to him?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.777
Sometimes.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.712
You must look like a lunatic.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.514
Fit right in
in BlueBell.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.082
You would think so, but no.

06:22.082 --> 06:27.455
So... what do you say to him
on these little chats?

06:27.455 --> 06:30.057
I don't know.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.425
"What now?

06:31.425 --> 06:34.261
You got me here;
what's the plan?"

06:34.261 --> 06:36.830
Sounds like you are lost.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.932
It's like Harley left me
this mystery novel

06:38.932 --> 06:41.902
with the next chapter
ripped out.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.504
Oh, I hate that.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.938
My VCR used to cut out

06:44.938 --> 06:46.874
the last five minutes
of Murder, She Wrote,

06:46.874 --> 06:49.342
and I would never know
who the killer was.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.812
Usually it was Linda Purl.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.714
She had a bad streak in her.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.150
But sometimes it was
Lee Meriwether.

06:57.150 --> 07:01.755
I really don't know any of those
things you're saying right now.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.993
But ever since I got here,
I sort of have felt like a leaf

07:05.993 --> 07:08.395
that has fallen from the tree
and is just blowing around,

07:08.395 --> 07:09.863
never touches the ground.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.700
You've seen those big live oaks
we have all around?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.468
Hundreds of years old.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.369
How is it they keep standing,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.305
storm after storm?

07:18.305 --> 07:20.240
Roots!

07:20.240 --> 07:22.342
Deep and wide.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
Yeah, I don't have any of those.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.178
Oh, don't be stupid,
of course you do.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.616
You have your family,
you have your history.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.083
How are the Belles?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.585
What?

07:31.585 --> 07:32.786
Uh, I don't know.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.588
Shallow and mean as ever,
I guess.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.658
You see this?

07:37.658 --> 07:41.361
This is a sacred ring
of the BlueBell Belles.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.196
You're a Belle?

07:43.196 --> 07:45.398
A proud and powerful group.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.000
Goes back 200 years.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.603
One that helped
build the South.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.140
You want to know your family?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.508
Welcome to the family.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.611
Because, by legacy,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.613
you are a Belle.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.466
Stuff isn't all
yours, is it?

08:19.466 --> 08:21.501
Some of these things
are your mother's?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.137
Mm, some, I guess.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.642
Wow. Well, that's...
kind of a big deal, isn't it?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.711
I mean, you and Brick
haven't touched this stuff

08:30.711 --> 08:32.345
for, like,
12 years, right?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.783
Well, it's a new year,
and she's not coming back,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.784
so why not let
somebody else enjoy it?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.654
So is this that thing
that I read about,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.089
where a woman
who's getting married

08:42.089 --> 08:44.391
starts to clear some space
for a new life?

08:44.391 --> 08:45.525
Mm-hmm.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.628
Is that, by any
chance, why you been

08:47.628 --> 08:49.797
unusually high-strung
the last month or so?

08:49.797 --> 08:51.531
Why, yes, George, exactly.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.000
Hey, guys!

08:53.000 --> 08:53.934
Hi.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.803
Stop!
Where'd you get that ring?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.671
It's a Belle ring.
Where'd you get it?

08:57.671 --> 09:00.407
Turns out, I found out
who my people are.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.942
Up high, sister.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.348
ANNABETH:
 Why would Zoe Hart

09:08.348 --> 09:09.650
even want to be a Belle?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.218
To drive me to an early grave.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.452
Isn't that obvious?

09:12.452 --> 09:15.889
And that is the only way
she will ever become a Belle.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.490
We all have
our roles to play,

09:17.490 --> 09:20.093
and we must play those roles
and not some other roles and,

09:20.093 --> 09:21.962
Cricket, why do you have
your arm in the air

09:21.962 --> 09:23.496
like a first grader
having to go tinkle?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.065
Just that Zoe Hart's
a legacy.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
Can't imagine how we
can stop her joining.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.102
Because you have
a tiny imagination.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.671
That may be true.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.105
Just because
she can be a Belle

09:32.105 --> 09:33.641
doesn't mean that
she'll pass the initiation--

09:33.641 --> 09:35.542
and, AnnaBeth,
if you raise your arm,

09:35.542 --> 09:37.510
I will pull it off
at the shoulder.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.279
What initiation?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.749
Yeah. My mama said the Belle's
stopped doing Hell Week

09:41.749 --> 09:44.117
back in the '70s, when
three girls almost drowned

09:44.117 --> 09:45.452
getting their
riverboat paddling.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.255
But the bylaws have not changed,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.791
which means that
any new Belle can be asked

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
to pass a series of trials

09:52.259 --> 09:55.729
designed to reflect the
strengths, challenges and skills

09:55.729 --> 09:57.731
of the Southern woman
throughout history.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.733
Let's make her drink
a milk shake every day.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.834
She'll get so fat!

10:00.834 --> 10:02.703
I got this, thanks.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.005
Oh.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.341
Is it okay if
I sit here?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.943
Cool. First
Belle meeting.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.712
Sorry, am I late?
Not at all.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.681
We were just discussing
your initiation.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.816
Initia-what?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.250
Well, I mean, unless you prefer

10:17.250 --> 10:19.720
to resign now
and just get it over with.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.355
What no one's wanted
to tell you is that

10:22.355 --> 10:25.025
the Wilkes are not
of a very strong stock.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.094
They have a lot of quit in them.

10:27.094 --> 10:27.895
Yeah.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.897
Not in this Wilkes.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.099
I have the opposite
of quit in me.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
Which is...

10:33.734 --> 10:35.568
not quit.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.837
Come on.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.638
Do your worst.
Let's do it.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.640
Yes.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.175
Let's.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.745
Every time I run
into the mayor,

10:44.745 --> 10:46.079
I get so sad for him.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.614
On our first
and only date,

10:47.614 --> 10:48.949
he was already talking
about soul mates

10:48.949 --> 10:50.317
and getting married.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.252
It's like that time
when I was eight years old

10:52.252 --> 10:54.855
and I was at the petting zoo
and I tried to feed the llama,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.323
but instead of
taking a little lick,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.591
he grabbed my whole arm
and pulled it through the fence.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.860
Didi, I just asked you

10:59.860 --> 11:01.394
how things went down
at the courthouse.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.696
Did you happen
to find out

11:02.696 --> 11:04.064
who owns that little
piece of land?

11:04.064 --> 11:06.266
Yes, someone named
Earl Kinsella.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.169
No. Oh, no.
What?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.704
W-What, is that bad?
What does it mean?

11:10.704 --> 11:15.008
Just that the fate of BlueBell
is in the hands of Crazy Earl.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.410
I'm not drunk, it's just...

11:17.410 --> 11:21.214
m-my blood pressure medicine
makes me a little loopy, is all.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.051
Why don't you go ahead
and make a big old loop
right on out of here?

11:24.051 --> 11:26.053
Can't you just front me
a little something,

11:26.053 --> 11:27.354
you know,
for my medicine?

11:27.354 --> 11:31.024
You sure do go through
a lot of medicine, Earl.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.927
Just a loan.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.095
You'll get it all back.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.830
Go on and get out
of here like I said.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.366
* *

11:43.570 --> 11:45.505
Geena.
Hi.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.974
How you been, girl?

11:46.974 --> 11:48.441
Hey, when did you get
back from Atlanta?

11:48.441 --> 11:49.509
A job ended two weeks ago.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.311
Been laying low
here since then.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.646
Well, it's good
to see you, yeah.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.649
Hey, maybe you and I should
get a bite to eat sometime.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.852
Oh, Lavon,
that sounds good,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.653
but I've started being
friends with Didi,

12:00.653 --> 12:01.989
and, well, you know
how that is.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.958
No, I-I don't think I do.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.226
It's okay, she told me.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.195
You're just
too hung up on her.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.196
I can't.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.831
Oh, n-n-no.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.332
No, no.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.834
No.

12:13.834 --> 12:14.868
What's wrong, compadre?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.603
Didi, that's what.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.872
It's bad enough, she thinks I'm
in love with her or something.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.407
Now she's telling other women.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.010
She keeps this up, I might
as well be the town eunuch.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.444
Something happen
to Wally Hodge?

12:24.444 --> 12:25.678
Yeah, he moved away.
Oh.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.982
Well, why does Didi think
you're in love with her?

12:29.817 --> 12:32.085
I-I got drunk.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.520
Started acting crazy.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.890
I-I may have said something
about us being soul mates

12:36.890 --> 12:40.627
and, uh, intimated
at a double wedding scenario.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.429
Oh!

12:42.429 --> 12:43.463
(laughing)

12:49.569 --> 12:52.472
Two iced teas for Crickett
and AnnaBeth outside.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.841
(grunting)

12:54.607 --> 12:56.009
What?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.378
Oh, yeah,
I'm joining the Belles.

12:58.378 --> 13:02.015
Part of Hell Week is crazy stuff
like I have to wear this dress

13:02.015 --> 13:03.116
every second,
and I have to be

13:03.116 --> 13:04.351
AnnaBeth's servant for one day,

13:04.351 --> 13:06.019
and then I have to shout
some Belles slogan

13:06.019 --> 13:07.620
if someone says the secret word.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.056
Which is what again?

13:09.056 --> 13:10.523
Like I'm gonna tell you.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.658
Iced teas, go.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.160
Hmm.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.195
I don't even know
where to start.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.430
I know, it's weird,
but it's about roots.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.698
Roots?
Yes.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.468
I don't have any, but I want
to know about my family.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.904
They got these things called
genealogy Web sites.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.305
Cost, like, 39 bucks.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.208
Yeah, I know, it's not
that clear to me either.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.110
I just know that Wilkes girls
have been doing

13:30.110 --> 13:31.544
this same thing
for hundreds of years.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.180
And what if,
by doing it,

13:33.180 --> 13:35.615
it makes me feel
more connected to something?

13:35.615 --> 13:36.917
It's one crazy week.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.786
What's another week
of crazy in BlueBell?

13:39.786 --> 13:41.088
Plus, Lemon's got
to hate it.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.690
No, Lemon really hates it.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.691
(laughs)

13:44.691 --> 13:45.959
Two iced teas.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.695
I, uh, I sweetened them
with sugar,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.163
though I suppose
I could have used

13:50.163 --> 13:51.531
honey.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.305
(laughs)

13:58.305 --> 14:00.740
(sighs)

14:00.740 --> 14:03.944
I'm a Belle, a southern Belle,
a 'Bama Belle, a Dixie Belle.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.712
I got secrets

14:05.712 --> 14:06.880
I won't tell.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.115
Y'all don't like it, go to--

14:08.115 --> 14:10.250
hello, soldier,
what's your pleasure?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.251
(applause)

14:12.719 --> 14:14.988
Bravo, bravo, that
was beautiful.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.225
Oh, you knew
the secret word was "honey"?

14:18.225 --> 14:19.927
I've known my share of Belles.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.195
They won't admit it, but I do.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.463
Really?

14:23.463 --> 14:24.464
Yep.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.334
Tucker.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.701
Lavon.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.869
Hey.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.838
Hey, Wade, you got,
you got a second?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.406
Yeah, yeah.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.277
GEORGE:
 Here's the thing, Wade.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.446
I need your dad
to help save the town.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.114
From what?
My dad.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.449
Large-Mart
is going to open

14:42.449 --> 14:44.317
a store outside of BlueBell,
and they are liable

14:44.317 --> 14:46.019
to throw a lot
of money at Earl

14:46.019 --> 14:47.454
to be able
to build a road

14:47.454 --> 14:48.288
on his land.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.123
That little
scrape of mud?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.291
No way.
No, trust me,

14:51.291 --> 14:52.759
okay, and nobody
wants that

14:52.759 --> 14:54.394
because as soon as they set up
shop outside of BlueBell,

14:54.394 --> 14:55.795
it's gonna drive
all the business out of here.

14:55.795 --> 14:56.930
Okay?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.799
Well, I'm not
gonna talk to him,

14:59.799 --> 15:02.202
and my advice is,
neither should you.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.004
Why not?
He only listens to me,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.872
so Large-Mart doesn't
stand a chance

15:05.872 --> 15:08.441
unless you go
talking to him.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.310
'Cause Crazy Earl--
he ain't stupid,

15:10.310 --> 15:12.445
and you, George Tucker,
do not know how to lie.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.114
If he knows there's
money involved,

15:14.114 --> 15:15.315
he's going to want it.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.318
Best bet-- do like
I've always done

15:18.318 --> 15:23.056
and just stay away
from Crazy Earl.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.963
Oh, well,
there you are.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.664
I'd begun to think
you got called up

15:31.664 --> 15:33.366
in the Rapture
or something.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.068
Wait, do your people
go to Heaven?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.070
With my family, it's
Fort Lauderdale.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.240
Okay, here is
your dry cleaning,

15:40.240 --> 15:44.477
your diet root beer float,
your flowers, your groceries.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.214
Oh, I'm sorry it took a
while, but on your list,

15:47.214 --> 15:49.682
it just said "feminine
products," so I had to guess.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.219
Mm-hmm.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.453
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.222
Do you not say that
out loud around here?

15:55.222 --> 15:57.257
It's fine, I'm fine.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.559
It just means
I'm not pregnant again.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.593
Oh, sorry.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.395
How long have you been
trying to conceive?

16:02.395 --> 16:05.032
It doesn't matter,
it's silly.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.100
Every month,
here I go again being sad

16:07.100 --> 16:09.569
when I know I can't get
pregnant anyway.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.172
I'm sure it just
feels that way.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.873
I did some work in
a fertility clinic,

16:13.873 --> 16:15.642
and often there's
a reason for it.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.744
There is, yes.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.548
I can't have a baby because
I've been cursed by Lemon.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.421
AnnaBeth,
AnnaBeth, wait.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.757
What do you mean,
Lemon cursed you?

16:30.757 --> 16:33.526
Can we talk
somewhere else?

16:33.526 --> 16:35.195
Sure, where?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.731
There-- I'm in the sun,
and I burn.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.936
Okay, what?

16:43.936 --> 16:47.907
Well, it was about three years
ago, up at the Gypsy's grave.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.310
We go there for
sacred rituals

16:50.310 --> 16:52.179
and sometimes margaritas,

16:52.179 --> 16:55.048
and that night
 Lemon had us make a pact.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.284
In front of the Gypsy,
who watches over us

16:57.284 --> 16:59.319
and provides
the magic and mystery

16:59.319 --> 17:02.289
in our lives,
we agree among sisters,

17:02.289 --> 17:03.923
under the threat
of curse,

17:03.923 --> 17:06.492
that none
shall have babies

17:06.492 --> 17:11.397
until we all get married
and can all have babies

17:11.397 --> 17:16.403
at... the same... time.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.275
It just seemed like a fun idea,

17:22.275 --> 17:24.042
and we all knew how
important it was

17:24.042 --> 17:25.311
for Lemon to have babies,

17:25.311 --> 17:26.878
and she had been
through so much

17:26.878 --> 17:28.715
losing her mother, and
she and George were about

17:28.715 --> 17:29.982
to get married
anyways,

17:29.982 --> 17:32.485
but then George moved
away for two years

17:32.485 --> 17:33.953
and they're still
not married,

17:33.953 --> 17:35.322
and I wish they
would just elope

17:35.322 --> 17:37.990
and have a baby before
my insides dry up.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.492
Okay, wait, shh.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.694
There's no such thing
as a curse.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.763
Pregnancy is biology.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.832
There is a biological reason
that you can't conceive.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.402
My husband and I snuck out to
Mobile to see a specialist,

17:49.402 --> 17:53.106
and he ran all these tests
and said nothing's wrong.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.375
Okay, then we'll run
different tests.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.977
Lemon can't stop you

17:57.977 --> 17:59.746
from having a baby
if you want one.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.014
(sighs)

18:02.014 --> 18:06.319
I do... I really do.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.660
Sorry, Lavon.

18:13.660 --> 18:18.565
Didi's my friend, and besides,
I am no one's rebound girl.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.567
LAVON:
No,

18:20.567 --> 18:23.270
no, no problem.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.272
It's cool.
Bye.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.040
Have a good one.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.176
(laughs)

18:30.777 --> 18:32.579
This will not do.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.214
How am I supposed
to go and carpe diem

18:34.214 --> 18:36.816
when Didi is telling
every woman in town
I'm not dateable?

18:36.816 --> 18:40.820
Well, if, by "carpe diem," you
mean "get laid," you're not.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.822
The people in this town need
to see that you are dateable

18:42.822 --> 18:45.925
and that you don't
give a damn about Didi.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.227
How am I gonna do that?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.528
Leave that to me.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.430
Making women feel like
I don't give a damn

18:50.430 --> 18:52.899
is right in
my wheelhouse.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.844
Okay, all right, I'm gonna
have you wait in here.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.247
I'm gonna call your doctor
in Mobile, get your records.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.184
Dr. Hart,

19:11.184 --> 19:12.919
I wanted to ask you,
do we have

19:12.919 --> 19:14.421
enough sore throat drops?

19:14.421 --> 19:15.722
I mean,
it's cold season now,

19:15.722 --> 19:17.357
and I would hate
for people to have to rely

19:17.357 --> 19:19.826
on hot tea and honey.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
(groans)

19:23.430 --> 19:27.334
ZOE:
I'm a Belle, a southern Belle,
a Dixie Belle, a 'Bama Belle,

19:27.334 --> 19:28.801
and I've got secrets
I won't tell.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.937
If y'all don't like it,
go to-- hello, soldier,

19:30.937 --> 19:32.939
what's your pleasure?

19:35.775 --> 19:40.046
Oh, never mind--
look what I found.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.415
(knocking)

19:44.217 --> 19:46.319
Well, how about this?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.821
Two visitors
in one day.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.925
Wade.

19:52.925 --> 19:53.926
What's he doing here?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.395
Same as you.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.129
The Large-Mart deal.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.466
See, you don't have to be a
good liar to be a good lawyer.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.768
You just got to be
good at spotting one.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.042
I went over your doctor's
records from Mobile,

20:10.042 --> 20:13.079
and my ultrasound doesn't show
anything abnormal either.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.247
So it's true.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.382
I'm cursed.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.951
No, no. One girl
not getting pregnant

20:18.951 --> 20:20.387
isn't a curse.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.723
Look, sometimes people take
a while before conceiving.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.558
There is no curse.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.864
Well, uh, thank you
for caring, Dr. Hart.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.733
I mean it.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.136
Now, go wash my car while the
sun's still up to dry it off.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.439
Okay, bye now.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.013
Oh, AnnaBeth,
how are you?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.415
Dr. Breeland. Hi.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.183
Uh, I was just in there
on Belle business,

20:51.183 --> 20:52.819
not doctor business--
Belle business.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.688
You know, that, that is
a lovely pin you have there.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.390
Where, where did
you get that?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.825
Oh, thank you.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.160
I just bought it today over
at the church flea market.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.431
Well, that-that's
very nice.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.634
Uh... you take care.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.035
You, too.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.309
I don't want to sell.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.610
There's money
in that land,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.111
and I want to leave
it for my sons.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.147
The land ain't worth a cent,
you crazy old man,

21:21.147 --> 21:24.083
and I, for one, don't want
some wet old piece of dirt.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.652
Why don't you sell
the land to Large-Mart,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.253
get yourself
some actual money?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.121
No, you mean get you some money.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.991
See, I saw it in your eyes
the moment that I told...

21:31.991 --> 21:34.226
I-I should have never told
you what was going on.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.928
I thought it would be
nice for him

21:35.928 --> 21:38.465
to stand on his own two feet
for a change,

21:38.465 --> 21:41.133
to not have to come begging me
for money all the time,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.302
and I don't want to feel
like I'm letting down

21:43.302 --> 21:45.004
the entire town
because of it

21:45.004 --> 21:48.908
or that I'm selling out my dad
so that you can beat yours.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.812
That's not what's going on here.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.648
Yeah. Yeah, I bet.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.591
That is a
very fine job.

22:04.591 --> 22:07.326
You are officially not
my servant anymore.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.096
I did it? I'm in?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.498
I'm a Belle!

22:11.498 --> 22:12.932
Where's my crown or whatever?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.367
(laughing)

22:14.367 --> 22:15.868
Oh, you silly girl.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.837
That was just AnnaBeth's turn.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.573
We all get a crack at you
before you're a Belle.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.447
* *

22:41.861 --> 22:44.564
(whirring)

22:48.300 --> 22:50.136
(sighs)

22:51.571 --> 22:54.541
ZOE:
* Away, away *

22:54.541 --> 22:57.544
* Away down south *

22:57.544 --> 23:04.383
* In Dixie...! *

23:12.692 --> 23:15.995
This better be worth it,
old man.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.229
(sighs)

23:17.229 --> 23:18.731
(knocking)

23:18.731 --> 23:20.467
Come in!

23:22.535 --> 23:25.872
Oh, no. What do I have
to do for you, now?

23:25.872 --> 23:27.173
Mani-pedi?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.340
Brush your teeth?

23:28.340 --> 23:29.842
You're a doctor.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.912
You need to break Lemon's curse
so I can get pregnant.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.914
Huh.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.756
What exactly
 is a pink tea?

23:45.091 --> 23:48.795
Well... everything is pink.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.497
Right.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.765
(quietly):
So,

23:52.765 --> 23:54.400
I've been thinking
about your situation.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.970
Do you know if any other of
the other Belles can't get,

23:57.970 --> 23:59.005
you know?

23:59.005 --> 24:01.040
I thought
I was the only one trying.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.409
Lord knows what Lemon would say
if she found out.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.779
Someone said they saw AnnaBeth
coming out of your office.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.815
I made her tell me why.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.250
All I know is,
no one has gotten...

24:11.250 --> 24:13.252
you know...

24:13.252 --> 24:14.787
since the pact.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.657
I need to find
another non-curse reason.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.493
Like, is there anything
that you all have in common?

24:20.493 --> 24:23.129
We like pink.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.531
Okay, good.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.999
And God. We like God.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.203
I just saw the lemonade,

24:31.203 --> 24:33.973
and it's supposed
to be dyed pink, but it's red!

24:33.973 --> 24:36.576
How are we supposed to have a
pink tea with red lemonade?

24:36.576 --> 24:39.078
We'll all just look like
we're sipping a cup of blood,

24:39.078 --> 24:41.614
just a bunch of pretty vampires,
enjoying a cup of blood

24:41.614 --> 24:43.550
before we all go out
on a killing spree!

24:43.550 --> 24:46.385
(sighs)
I dumped it all out.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.220
Y'all need to start over.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.189
Do it right.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.661
(spoon rattling in teacup)

24:57.564 --> 24:58.998
DIDI:
Hiya, Amy.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.300
How you doing?
It's so good to see you.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.369
Okay, okay. Go now.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.972
Take the NASCAR girls
and show this town Lavon Hayes

25:05.972 --> 25:08.140
is open for business,
ready to carpe him some diem.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.142
Yeah.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.685
(laughs)
Oh, I love that.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.619
What's up, Didi?

25:19.619 --> 25:21.621
(laughs)
Yeah.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.359
DIDI:
Breaks my heart.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.895
It does.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.262
Trying to get me jealous.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.865
He's you're friend.
Make him get over me.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.205
(laughs)

25:40.539 --> 25:43.375
(clears his throat)

25:43.375 --> 25:44.977
Mr. Kinsella.

25:44.977 --> 25:45.878
Earl is fine.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.714
Uh, please, have a seat.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.248
It's okay.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.852
I just come to get the number
of them folks at Large-Mart.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.121
I'm gonna sell
'em my land.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.058
Okay.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.993
Look, Earl, I...

26:00.993 --> 26:02.862
I don't think you understand

26:02.862 --> 26:05.598
what could happen
to BlueBell if you sell

26:05.598 --> 26:06.699
your land.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.867
Oh, I am aware, thank you.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.301
And don't try to
talk me out of it.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.904
I heard what my son
said. He's right.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.073
If I sell that piece,

26:14.073 --> 26:17.109
he won't have
to give me money no more.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.911
Won't have to

26:18.911 --> 26:21.380
bother with me at all,

26:21.380 --> 26:23.315
I expect.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.489
Okay.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.358
I'll get you that number.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.493
Just...

26:34.493 --> 26:36.162
give me a day or two, all right?

26:44.203 --> 26:48.307
So, I just heard
the craziest rumor.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.944
You're going to laugh
when I tell you this.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.747
That you and the Belles
made some sort of pact

26:54.747 --> 26:56.816
that you're all waiting
to have babies together.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.618
That is none
of your business.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.689
Someone tell you that?
Who told you that?

27:02.689 --> 27:03.956
Is someone pregnant?
Who?
No.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.358
Actually, no one's pregnant,

27:06.358 --> 27:10.262
because, well, they all think
that you cursed them.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.563
(laughs)

27:11.563 --> 27:13.666
Cursed them?

27:13.666 --> 27:16.102
You're a doctor,
and you believe in curses?

27:16.102 --> 27:21.107
No, but I do believe that
fear can freeze the uterus,

27:21.107 --> 27:22.809
and that fear
of how you'll react

27:22.809 --> 27:24.677
if one of them
gets pregnant before you

27:24.677 --> 27:26.345
is stressing them out,
so be nice.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.446
Let them have babies.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.048
So, let me get this straight.

27:29.048 --> 27:32.919
I'm a witch with the power
to make women infertile.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.854
Is that what you think?

27:34.854 --> 27:36.455
No.
That I

27:36.455 --> 27:37.724
terrorize my friends?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.826
Well, Zoe Hart,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.761
who thinks
she can come into my house

27:41.761 --> 27:43.930
and tell me how
to speak to my Belles,

27:43.930 --> 27:46.465
prepare to feel the cold hand
of fear around your heart,

27:46.465 --> 27:48.735
and take tonight to get
your affairs in order,

27:48.735 --> 27:51.270
because tomorrow, you are mine.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.072
Wow.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.274
I think I just felt
my eggs dry up.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.811
Yup.

28:02.715 --> 28:05.617
(phone ringing)

28:05.617 --> 28:07.920
Zoe Hart. (laughs)
Good morning.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.521
Hey, when you left
this morning,

28:09.521 --> 28:13.459
did you notice anyone or, say,
any animals hanging around?

28:13.459 --> 28:15.061
(Lavon laughs)

28:15.061 --> 28:18.064
Oh, Lemon's got you turned
inside-out, I see.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.799
Yeah, well,
today's her day with me,

28:19.799 --> 28:21.200
and I couldn't sleep last night,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.469
wondering if the day started
at midnight, or at dawn.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.372
Ah. She's engaging in effective
psychological warfare--

28:26.372 --> 28:28.707
breaking you down
without even lifting a finger.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.976
Oh, my God, you're right.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.078
It's like what she does
to the Belles--

28:32.078 --> 28:33.545
making them afraid of something

28:33.545 --> 28:35.114
she might do.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.816
Yeah.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.818
That Lemon--

28:38.818 --> 28:40.787
she sure can get in your head.

28:40.787 --> 28:41.921
Well, not mine.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.355
I'm going to stick it out

28:43.355 --> 28:45.724
to make sure
she eases up on those girls.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.193
No more making myself crazy

28:47.193 --> 28:48.961
over things
that probably won't even happen.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.163
(sighs):
Thanks, Lavon.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.639
Fire!

29:00.639 --> 29:03.742
(Zoe screaming, explosive pops
of paintballs firing)

29:05.111 --> 29:07.313
* *

29:22.728 --> 29:24.730
You got a second?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.265
Yup.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.401
Your dad came by
my office today.

29:29.401 --> 29:32.004
Told me he's gonna go ahead
and sell to Large-Mart.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.507
Okay. Well...
I know it's not what you wanted.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.677
No, it's not...
but the main thing is,

29:38.677 --> 29:41.347
is I don't think
it's what he wants, either.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.015
Wade, I think

29:43.015 --> 29:45.084
he really wants
to leave his land to his boys.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.219
Well, why would he think
we want it?

29:47.219 --> 29:49.889
I don't know,
but Earl, I know,

29:49.889 --> 29:51.657
has not done right
by you guys,

29:51.657 --> 29:54.693
and that little patch of dirt
is not much of a legacy,

29:54.693 --> 29:56.295
but it's all he has.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.997
Well, then,
why doesn't he sell it,

29:57.997 --> 30:00.099
live off the money,
and when Old Earl croaks,

30:00.099 --> 30:02.334
he can pass on what's left
to his precious sons?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.769
'Cause it's not
about the money, Wade.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.771
Well, he asks me
for enough of it, George.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.173
Exactly.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.508
Just like... why does he come
into town once a month

30:09.508 --> 30:12.879
and make you, and only you,
get him down off that roof?

30:12.879 --> 30:14.914
Because he wants
to know you will.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.650
I really think that
Earl just wants to know

30:18.650 --> 30:20.786
that you love him
before he dies.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.889
And he... wants you to know

30:22.889 --> 30:26.092
that he loved you... afterwards.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.263
Is that all?

30:34.867 --> 30:37.069
(sighs)

30:40.772 --> 30:42.741
(laughs)

30:42.741 --> 30:44.410
You call that
silver polished?

30:44.410 --> 30:45.644
Yup.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.346
That is not polished!

30:47.346 --> 30:49.348
I don't know.
Seems pretty polished to me.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.417
I'm sorry.
Did I say talk?

30:51.417 --> 30:52.318
Do it again!

30:52.318 --> 30:54.353
You know
I have knives here, right?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.055
Well, if this is
too much for you,

30:56.055 --> 30:58.257
then, why don't you quit?

30:59.825 --> 31:04.463
Because there is nothing
you can bring that I can't beat.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.099
I have pulled 30-hour
shifts in the ER,

31:07.099 --> 31:09.101
I've ridden the subway
to Queens at 2:00 a.m.,

31:09.101 --> 31:11.603
and I have eaten
oysters off a truck.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.972
I am strong.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.307
But, Lemon, your other Belles--
they're not,

31:15.307 --> 31:17.243
so you're gonna have to take it
a little easier on them.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.179
You would like that, huh,
if I just took things easier?

31:20.179 --> 31:22.114
Well, how about instead,

31:22.114 --> 31:24.984
you go out back,
and you milk our cow?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.852
And I want two buckets
of milk,

31:26.852 --> 31:28.554
or don't come back
into the house.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.690
With pleasure.

31:31.690 --> 31:32.658
Great.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.966
We have a cow?

31:39.966 --> 31:42.201
We do today.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.436
Hey, how you doing? Good.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.280
(clears his throat)

31:57.116 --> 31:59.085
Hi. Please don't run.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.987
No hookers on your arm today?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.754
They-They weren't hookers.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.156
I don't think.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.624
Maybe they were. I don't know.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.094
But I came here to say that
I am not obsessed with you.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.196
I don't want us
to get married.

32:10.196 --> 32:14.600
Well, then,
why did you say all that stuff?

32:14.600 --> 32:15.767
Because...

32:15.767 --> 32:16.969
To be polite.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.404
I can be real polite.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.472
You called us soul mates
to be polite?

32:20.472 --> 32:21.773
Okay. Truth?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.442
I was trying
to get over someone,

32:23.442 --> 32:26.778
and I shouldn't have dated, but
I wanted to because I liked you.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.081
Well, I liked you, too.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.850
And I was acting all
crazy and stuff. I'm sorry.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.185
Please tell all
your lady friends

32:33.185 --> 32:35.087
so they will go out with me.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.526
Lavon, I don't think
I'm comfortable doing that.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.994
Why not?

32:41.994 --> 32:43.562
Because

32:43.562 --> 32:45.397
if you're not
all Looney Tunes...

32:45.397 --> 32:49.001
then I want to go out
with you myself.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.038
You do?

32:52.038 --> 32:54.673
If you promise not to ask me
to marry you.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.475
Yeah, I do. I-I do.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.077
(laughs)

32:58.077 --> 33:01.180
Well... then I accept!

33:10.489 --> 33:13.125
Oh, Daddy.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.628
Lemon, what are you doing?

33:16.628 --> 33:18.830
Taking Mama's things
to the church again

33:18.830 --> 33:19.965
after you bought 'em all back.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.633
Yeah, I did.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.103
Now, I did not want to
get into this you,

33:24.103 --> 33:26.138
but you had no right
to get rid of all this stuff

33:26.138 --> 33:27.473
without consulting me.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.508
I mean, she is your mother,
but she was my wife.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.976
Why do you want
to keep it all here anyway?

33:30.976 --> 33:32.311
Listen, Daddy,

33:32.311 --> 33:35.114
I am sorry, but she is not
coming back. Not ever.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.115
You don't know that.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.250
Yes, I do.
How?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.854
Some things you just know.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.124
In your heart.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.226
Listen, she is not

33:47.226 --> 33:49.361
a part of our lives anymore,
and I don't see why

33:49.361 --> 33:51.497
you want to keep us surrounded
by reminders of that.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.069
No, I see that.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.072
And how painful
that must be for you.

34:00.072 --> 34:04.710
Look, I don't need all her
clothes around here to remind me

34:04.710 --> 34:07.079
of her, anyway...

34:07.079 --> 34:09.114
because I got you girls.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.518
Especially you.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.520
You're so much like your mother.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.524
It's almost like having
her around here sometimes.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.762
Thank you, Daddy.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.071
(sighs)

34:37.143 --> 34:38.777
(sighs)

34:38.777 --> 34:40.379
(door opens and closes)

34:41.547 --> 34:44.550
Okay, I planted the bulbs,
and brought in firewood.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.051
Anything else?

34:46.051 --> 34:47.853
Um... yes.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.589
I may have dropped an...
an earring in the garbage.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.859
Could you run out to the cans
and dig around for it?

34:53.859 --> 34:55.393
No problem.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.728
Stop!

34:59.798 --> 35:01.800
Garbage?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.135
Are you insane?

35:03.135 --> 35:04.470
I want to
know right now.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.272
Why do you want
to become a Belle?

35:06.272 --> 35:08.006
Is it because
I don't want you to?

35:08.006 --> 35:10.209
No, but it does keep me going,

35:10.209 --> 35:11.877
so, thanks.
Okay, then why?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.246
Because I want to know who I am.

35:14.246 --> 35:17.082
And the people who I came from--
they did this,

35:17.082 --> 35:18.384
and according to you
and everyone else,

35:18.384 --> 35:20.051
who we are is who we came from.

35:20.051 --> 35:22.053
Don't say that.
Why?

35:22.053 --> 35:23.989
Because it's ridiculous.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.491
Because if

35:25.491 --> 35:28.360
who we are is who we came from,
then I am destined

35:28.360 --> 35:30.362
to be the worst mother
in the entire world.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.030
The kind who doesn't

35:32.030 --> 35:34.433
care about anyone but herself,
the kind who can just

35:34.433 --> 35:36.101
leave her children
without a glance back.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.369
Okay, whoa. No, I-I didn't...

35:37.369 --> 35:40.071
Okay, and I won't do that
to a child.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.440
I won't.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.284
LEMON:
Well, ladies,

35:52.284 --> 35:53.585
the day is upon us.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.921
Zoe Hart has met
every challenge,

35:55.921 --> 35:57.189
and she is to be...

35:57.189 --> 35:59.057
a Belle.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.592
(laughing):
Oh, I don't know.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.662
She didn't turn out to be as bad
as I thought.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.897
LEMON:
AnnaBeth has

36:05.897 --> 36:07.032
the right attitude.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.334
We must accept it.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.069
Our ancestors weathered
the presence

36:11.069 --> 36:14.005
of Northern aggressors
150 years ago,

36:14.005 --> 36:18.377
and we shall do the same until
this storm, too, has passed.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.046
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.714
I'm sorry.
Is there something

36:22.714 --> 36:25.351
about the term "pink tea"
that you find confusing?

36:25.351 --> 36:27.353
Most of it, actually.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.788
Can I talk to you in private?

36:33.191 --> 36:35.394
Ladies.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.331
I'm not joining the Belles.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.032
Pardon me?
I'm sorry

36:41.032 --> 36:44.236
you went to the trouble, but I
kind of think you'll survive.

36:44.236 --> 36:48.407
I'm sure I will, but...
why the change?

36:48.407 --> 36:50.576
Because of what
you said last night.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.078
How you thought you
wouldn't be a good mother

36:53.078 --> 36:54.513
because your mom wasn't.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.215
Lemon, that's
just not true.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.918
So, you're a fortune teller,
now?

36:59.918 --> 37:02.220
No. And I'm also

37:02.220 --> 37:04.423
not my Aunt Maureen.

37:04.423 --> 37:08.126
The truth is...
yeah, I'm a little lost.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.195
And I thought finding my family,

37:10.195 --> 37:12.898
you know,
would be finding myself.

37:12.898 --> 37:17.669
But even though I share
their blood and their history,

37:17.669 --> 37:19.838
it's the choices
that I make today

37:19.838 --> 37:22.107
and every day that
make me who I am.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.410
And I'm not a Belle.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.013
And you, Lemon,

37:28.013 --> 37:30.282
arenot your mom.

37:32.117 --> 37:35.153
You never even knew my mother.

37:35.153 --> 37:38.657
No, but I've heard about her.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.692
And I know
that you are not weak,

37:40.692 --> 37:42.394
and you don't run
away from things.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.730
And now, thanks
to my Aunt Maureen

37:44.730 --> 37:48.467
and Harley and you,
I know that I don't, either.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.003
Except for paintball guns.
Those hurt.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.340
(laughs)

37:54.340 --> 37:56.808
Well...

37:56.808 --> 37:59.711
there's a lot
of pink cake to be eaten.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.180
You're welcome
to have a piece.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.315
Thank you.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.316
To go, of course.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.784
I assumed.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.825
Hey.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.162
Saw this shirt at the
church flea market.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.498
Thought it
might fit you.

38:20.466 --> 38:25.203
Just so you know...

38:25.203 --> 38:27.072
if you ever sell
this land to anyone,

38:27.072 --> 38:28.740
anyone at all,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.076
I'll never talk to you again.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.249
Get some decent food.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.686
You look like crap.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.501
In front of the Gypsy,
who watches over us

38:55.501 --> 38:58.504
and provides the magic
and mystery in our lives,

38:58.504 --> 39:01.106
we agree that anyone
who wants to have babies

39:01.106 --> 39:05.977
shall have babies,
and none shall be cursed.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.413
(gasps)
It is done!

39:07.413 --> 39:09.515
And we would like
to thank the Gypsy

39:09.515 --> 39:11.783
for teaching us the credo
of the Southern woman.

39:11.783 --> 39:15.787
She has one hand on the past,
one hand on the future...

39:15.787 --> 39:19.024
ALL:
And you must always
bring her a present!

39:19.024 --> 39:20.191
(laughter)

39:20.191 --> 39:22.494
Hey, running
dry over here!

39:23.695 --> 39:25.564
You should run some
electricity up here.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.966
Seriously, it
wouldn't be hard.

39:41.279 --> 39:43.482
(chuckles)

39:44.349 --> 39:46.552
* *

40:07.005 --> 40:08.740
(sighs)

40:20.952 --> 40:23.421
That's Harley's
cousin Olin.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.956
He's not really
a cousin.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.958
See, his mom-- your
Grandma Claire--

40:26.958 --> 40:29.495
she took him in when
they were kids,

40:29.495 --> 40:31.463
so it was like
they were related.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.632
He lives in Japan now,
retired over there.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.233
Why are you telling me this?

40:35.233 --> 40:38.704
Well, I watched all that stuff
you did to try and be a Belle,

40:38.704 --> 40:40.138
and, uh, well, the fact

40:40.138 --> 40:43.041
that you toughed it out,
and you never quit,

40:43.041 --> 40:44.476
uh,

40:44.476 --> 40:46.444
that is a Wilkes
if I ever did see one.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.580
I knew it! Lemon.

40:48.580 --> 40:49.915
So, anything you want to know

40:49.915 --> 40:51.683
about your people,
you can ask me.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.819
I know about all there is
to know.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.354
Who's that?

40:56.354 --> 40:59.324
That is your Grandma Claire,

40:59.324 --> 41:01.893
and her second husband, Guy.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.395
Only he pronounced it "Gee,"

41:04.395 --> 41:06.397
'cause he was French Canadian,

41:06.397 --> 41:08.399
but no one around
here obliged him.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.701
(laughs)

41:09.701 --> 41:11.236
What about him?

41:11.236 --> 41:12.504
Oh, I bet he was an uncle.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.205
Look around those eyes.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.473
I have those same eyes.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.108
No, that one is a president.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.077
Oh.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.247
Now, this fellow
over here...

41:22.247 --> 41:24.783
Harley met him
on a barge

41:24.783 --> 41:27.418
floating down
the Nile,

41:27.418 --> 41:31.189
and he took Harley for
everything he had playing poker.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.192
Of course, Harley always
said it was worth every cent.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.161
Look at all this.
A letter from Alaska.

41:36.161 --> 41:39.064
Now, do you know that Harley
lived in Alaska for two years?

41:39.064 --> 41:40.532
Really?
Yeah.

41:40.532 --> 41:44.936
