00:04.040 --> 00:05.480
Everyone's having a great time!

00:04.210 --> 00:05.480
<b>Chocolate</b>

00:05.780 --> 00:07.730
It's Valentine's Day, after all.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.500
I'm gonna do my best, too!

01:41.760 --> 01:42.990
It's so expensive!

01:42.990 --> 01:45.620
Everything is more expensive than yesterday.

01:45.890 --> 01:49.160
I guess everyone's thinking the same thing.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.690
Oh, Serara...

01:52.090 --> 01:53.210
Nyanta!

01:53.210 --> 01:55.010
Is something wrong?

01:55.990 --> 01:58.210
No... Um...

01:58.210 --> 02:01.060
Oh, coconia fruit, is it?

02:01.060 --> 02:05.790
It's a southern fruit used 
to make all kinds of things,

02:05.790 --> 02:08.020
like sweets and drinks.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.150
Oh, really?

02:10.150 --> 02:11.650
<i>I knew that, though.</i>

02:11.950 --> 02:17.780
And People of the Land have a legend about them.

02:18.210 --> 02:20.410
If you get the one you love to eat them

02:20.410 --> 02:22.850
on February 14, your love will be returned.

02:23.540 --> 02:28.580
Come to think of it, in the old world, 
today was Valentine's Day.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.130
Th-That's right.

02:30.130 --> 02:33.440
Anyway, um, I have things to do!

02:35.090 --> 02:35.970
Meow...

02:36.670 --> 02:42.510
<b>2.14  A Sweet Trap</b>

02:37.310 --> 02:39.780
2.14  A Sweet Trap.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.700
Master Naotsugu,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.610
please train me again today!

02:51.480 --> 02:53.020
Oh, sorry.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.420
I have something to do today.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.150
Marie wants to see you, right?

02:58.510 --> 02:59.550
Yeah.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.700
You know, it's Valentine's Day...

03:03.990 --> 03:05.680
Valentine's Day, huh?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.520
Come to think of it,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.040
we were once put through 
serious hell over that.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.530
That was Kanami, right?

03:13.980 --> 03:19.010
You were in the legendary Debauchery 
Tea Party, weren't you, Shiroe?

03:19.010 --> 03:20.180
So was I.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.380
And get off me.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.040
I heard Kanami was the leader of the Party.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.100
And she was beautiful and everyone loved her...

03:28.100 --> 03:30.470
And she was older than you.

03:30.470 --> 03:34.770
Hey, could she be...

03:34.970 --> 03:36.780
Your girlfriend?

03:37.990 --> 03:39.700
What are you talking about?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.030
It wasn't like that.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.920
Really? But you still like her, right?

03:41.300 --> 03:43.010
<i>I've never heard this.</i>

03:43.010 --> 03:45.560
<i>Who is this woman, exactly?</i>

03:43.920 --> 03:45.840
It's written all over your face!

03:45.560 --> 03:48.960
<i>And my lord, who never reacts 
to anything, is freaking out.</i>

03:45.840 --> 03:46.990
It is not.

03:46.990 --> 03:50.360
Liar! You can't fool me!

03:48.960 --> 03:51.040
<i>Could she really be his love?</i>

03:51.250 --> 03:52.330
<i>Older than he is?</i>

03:52.330 --> 03:53.500
<i>Broad-minded?</i>

03:53.860 --> 03:55.360
Hey, Tetra...

03:55.360 --> 03:59.110
If you're a girl, have a little modesty.

03:59.910 --> 04:04.470
A girl will wilt if she doesn't have 
good food and tales of love.

04:03.360 --> 04:09.330
Hey, has Master Naotsugu really 
not realized that Tetra is a guy?

04:09.680 --> 04:10.890
Seems that way.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.160
It's so obvious, though!

04:13.160 --> 04:15.020
Should I tell him?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.840
I'm not sure what to do.

04:17.250 --> 04:21.180
Is it "Miss Tetra" or "Mr. Tetra"?

04:21.180 --> 04:25.880
And I'm not sure if it'd be 
"Big Sis Tetra" or "Big Bro Tetra."

04:22.400 --> 04:23.950
<b>Brother</b>

04:23.950 --> 04:26.490
<b>Sister                                                                   Brother</b>

04:26.260 --> 04:28.240
What are you talking about?

04:28.590 --> 04:31.080
N-Nothing, Big Sibro Tetra!

04:31.500 --> 04:32.600
"Sibro"?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.750
<i>Crap! I combined "Sis" and "Bro"!</i>

04:35.170 --> 04:39.960
Actually, we were talking about what 
it would be best to call you.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.090
That's an easy one.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.610
Just call me "Tetra"!

04:48.510 --> 04:50.310
I figured it wouldn't work.

04:50.310 --> 04:54.890
It's rare to see you in the kitchen, Isuzu.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.020
Rare?

04:57.020 --> 04:58.900
What brings you here?

04:59.160 --> 05:03.120
Actually, I wanted to use these 
to make some sweets.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.410
Are these coconia fruits?

05:06.700 --> 05:07.680
Yeah.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.130
I don't really mean anything by it,

05:10.130 --> 05:13.310
but I'm thinking of making some for Rudy.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.330
Oh, my.

05:14.730 --> 05:17.130
But I'm not a cook.

05:17.370 --> 05:21.000
Then why don't we make them together?

05:22.210 --> 05:25.660
If I make them, they turn into gel...

05:25.660 --> 05:28.260
I've got the perfect item.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.310
<b>Newlywed's Apron Dress</b>

05:28.990 --> 05:31.590
The Newlywed's Apron Dress.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.720
I'll lend it to you.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.600
Oh!

05:34.980 --> 05:37.860
In exchange for a temporary level drop,

05:37.860 --> 05:41.860
it gives you a moderate cooking sub-skill.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.760
Wow!

05:43.760 --> 05:46.720
Even I'll be able to cook!

05:46.720 --> 05:48.870
It looks great on you.

05:49.070 --> 05:52.220
But why do you have this, Chief?

05:52.220 --> 05:54.870
It was a quest reward.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.720
Now, then.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.120
Since you've professed that 
you're not a good cook,

06:00.120 --> 06:03.130
I'll start by teaching you how 
to make simple sweets.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.620
First, peel the coconia fruits and

06:06.620 --> 06:09.000
cut them into slices, and then boil them.

06:09.650 --> 06:12.390
Once you can stick a toothpick clean through,

06:13.410 --> 06:14.890
move them to a bowl,

06:14.890 --> 06:17.380
and mash them with a spatula 
while they're still warm.

06:17.780 --> 06:22.070
If you strain them now, 
the taste will be much smoother.

06:22.070 --> 06:23.150
I see!

06:23.760 --> 06:28.380
Add sugar, egg yolks, cream, then butter,

06:28.380 --> 06:29.770
and mix them up.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.090
Once they've cooled,

06:32.090 --> 06:34.160
roll them into balls with your hands,

06:34.160 --> 06:37.160
and brush on some egg yolk.

06:37.590 --> 06:41.370
Then put them into an oven warmed 
with salamander heat,

06:41.370 --> 06:44.170
and cook them until they turn brown.

06:44.490 --> 06:48.400
And you've got sweet potato-style coconia.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.680
It smells so good!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.740
I'll go give them to Rudy before they get cold.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.680
Thanks, Chief!

06:57.580 --> 06:58.710
Now, then...

06:58.710 --> 07:02.860
It's still early in the day. I guess I'll clean.

07:03.510 --> 07:07.490
<i>It's Valentine's Day, so I'd like 
to give Shiroe a present.</i>

07:07.840 --> 07:11.700
<i>But if he takes it in a weird way, 
it'd be embarrassing...</i>

07:11.700 --> 07:15.720
<i>No, if he doesn't do anything, 
that'd be even worse.</i>

07:15.720 --> 07:18.500
<i>In any event, it's just to thank him.</i>

07:18.750 --> 07:20.500
Could she be...

07:20.500 --> 07:22.380
Your girlfriend?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.000
Kanami...

07:33.360 --> 07:34.640
Hey, there!

07:35.070 --> 07:37.470
Tetra, did you need something?

07:37.470 --> 07:40.620
You're curious about Kanami, aren't you?

07:40.620 --> 07:42.370
Wh-What are you talking about?

07:43.050 --> 07:45.150
You're so easy to read.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.880
Why not make it clear?

07:48.470 --> 07:49.660
No, no.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.780
Make what clear, exactly?

07:52.760 --> 07:53.450
Here.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.310
It's called a coconia fruit.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.810
They say it has a special 
effect on Valentine's Day.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.960
A special effect?

08:02.320 --> 08:05.770
Here! Look at the flavor text!

08:06.310 --> 08:07.710
"Coconia Fruit."

08:07.710 --> 08:09.730
"A southern fruit,

08:09.730 --> 08:13.590
used for many applications, such as 
making various dishes and drinks.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.300
If you feed them to someone on Valentine's Day,

08:16.300 --> 08:18.220
you may find out who they heart-heart."

08:19.490 --> 08:20.730
What does that mean?

08:21.350 --> 08:25.350
You've heard that flavor text has 
been coming true lately, right?

08:25.350 --> 08:29.860
Which means you might figure 
out who Shiroe loves.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.560
Wouldn't it be better to find out

08:32.560 --> 08:36.620
from Shiroe himself, rather than 
sit here alone and suffer?

08:36.620 --> 08:37.770
Bye!

08:38.780 --> 08:40.420
<i>Coconia fruit...</i>

08:43.710 --> 08:45.490
<i>Coconia fruit!</i>

08:46.880 --> 08:49.500
Even if you have stat boosts from the item,

08:49.890 --> 08:52.510
you're still doing quite well at this.

08:52.910 --> 08:56.080
Today's the day girls work hardest, after all.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.760
Girls?

08:57.980 --> 09:00.790
Wh-Who is she making them for?

09:01.770 --> 09:05.770
It's been six weeks since the magic 
circle protecting Akihabara vanished.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.520
It's more peaceful than I expected.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.430
Akihabara was always a place 
for high-level adventurers.

09:13.110 --> 09:15.950
No monster would willingly wander in,

09:15.950 --> 09:18.030
and any that did were wiped out immediately.

09:18.030 --> 09:22.040
The Round Table hasn't received 
any reports about PKs, either.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.080
Eins was really worried

09:23.560 --> 09:29.030
<b>We Have Chocolate!</b>

09:24.080 --> 09:26.780
when the Royal Guard system went out of whack,

09:26.780 --> 09:29.040
but it's actually working out.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.410
Still, we need to keep an eye out to ensure

09:32.410 --> 09:34.550
that no People of the Land get hurt.

09:34.550 --> 09:39.550
Well, the combat guilds are 
taking shifts to handle that.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.010
That's right.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.410
By the way, who's on duty today?

09:44.410 --> 09:45.860
West Wind, I think.

09:46.990 --> 09:48.940
Come to think of it, I haven't seen them.

09:48.940 --> 09:51.570
Today, of all days...

09:52.320 --> 09:53.570
Soujirou!

09:53.570 --> 09:55.570
<b>Leave Your Valentine's Day Chocolate Here</b>

09:53.570 --> 09:55.760
Please accept this as a sign of my love!

09:55.760 --> 09:57.370
Wait, I was here first!

09:57.370 --> 09:58.730
I was! Sou!

09:58.730 --> 09:59.890
Okay, okay.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.300
Stay in line.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.190
Thanks.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.220
I'll make sure to eat it, okay?

10:04.220 --> 10:07.000
Soujirou, thank you!

10:07.780 --> 10:09.870
Hey, no cutting!

10:10.740 --> 10:14.240
<i>Crusty's been missing ever since that day.</i>

10:15.300 --> 10:19.690
Jeez, where is that monster? 
And what is he doing?

10:20.090 --> 10:23.620
I bet if he wanted to, he could 
come back right away.

10:23.620 --> 10:27.730
Princess Lenessia, why are you 
in such sloppy dress again?

10:27.730 --> 10:29.600
It's past noon.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.780
I don't have any public duties today.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.010
That isn't the problem.

10:34.010 --> 10:36.360
It's important to remember your station.

10:37.380 --> 10:41.870
Coconia fruits were sold out today, 
so I used something else.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.970
Here, have some.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.510
Thanks, Elissa.

10:46.970 --> 10:48.470
<i>Honestly...</i>

10:48.470 --> 10:51.990
<i>What does he think a knight's 
pledge means, anyway?</i>

10:53.920 --> 10:55.510
It's sweet and delicious!

10:57.420 --> 10:58.470
Well?

10:58.840 --> 11:01.250
I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.220
I'm glad.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.880
There's still more to be done, but...

11:04.880 --> 11:09.230
I'll look for ingredients that don't 
put so much stress on the body.

11:09.470 --> 11:14.250
We at Radio Market are working with 
the Roderic Merchant Guild on it.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.530
Don't worry. It'll work.

11:16.530 --> 11:17.930
Thank you.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.240
But where did my right arm go?

11:22.510 --> 11:25.790
From the fact that healing magic doesn't work,

11:25.790 --> 11:30.940
we can be certain it isn't a type of 
damage that was in the old game.

11:30.940 --> 11:37.400
We can only guess that it's in the same 
place as Crusty, wherever he is.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.390
Either way, this is a very extraordinary case.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.670
Don't worry.

11:42.670 --> 11:45.010
Just focus on getting better.

11:45.470 --> 11:49.080
I'll work super hard until my lord returns!

11:49.610 --> 11:51.390
Yeah, thanks.

11:54.570 --> 11:55.500
<i>My lord...</i>

12:00.530 --> 12:01.820
Nyanta!

12:03.740 --> 12:06.330
They were cheap, so I bought a lot.

12:06.630 --> 12:09.000
<i>I bet they weren't cheap at all.</i>

12:09.360 --> 12:10.620
Nyanta!

12:10.620 --> 12:11.710
Yes?

12:11.940 --> 12:17.210
Since Shiroe is always so good to me,

12:17.210 --> 12:19.420
I wanted to make something for him...

12:19.420 --> 12:20.230
Meow?

12:20.230 --> 12:21.820
N-Not like that!

12:21.820 --> 12:23.650
It's nothing special!

12:24.640 --> 12:27.740
I understand how you feel.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.890
I'd be glad to help.

12:30.290 --> 12:31.600
Nyanta...

12:32.680 --> 12:34.100
Excuse me, master.

12:34.530 --> 12:38.460
I've returned from a training quest.

12:38.850 --> 12:41.020
As a reward, I just happened

12:41.020 --> 12:44.110
to receive a large number of coconia fruits, so...

12:44.110 --> 12:46.800
You just happened to get all those?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.580
I wanted to make my lord some...

12:48.950 --> 12:49.970
Minori?

12:50.350 --> 12:51.450
Akatsuki?

12:53.660 --> 12:55.440
<i>She has coconia fruits, too.</i>

12:55.440 --> 12:57.040
<i>For my lord?</i>

12:57.630 --> 12:59.570
<i>Look how beaten up she got.</i>

12:59.950 --> 13:01.590
<i>Does she also...</i>

13:05.740 --> 13:07.880
<i>Wh-What a problem.</i>

13:07.880 --> 13:11.520
<i>This is one of the worst things to 
happen in Log Horizon's history.</i>

13:13.510 --> 13:14.390
<i>Oh, man.</i>

13:14.390 --> 13:16.400
<i>This is too funny.</i>

13:16.400 --> 13:17.810
<i>They're rivals in love.</i>

13:17.810 --> 13:18.900
Okay, then!

13:20.720 --> 13:24.780
In that case, why not work together?

13:24.780 --> 13:27.280
You're both after the same thing.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.960
Work together?

13:28.960 --> 13:35.790
That's a great idea, but I only have 
one Newlywed's Apron Dress.

13:37.660 --> 13:38.760
Look!

13:38.760 --> 13:41.420
I got one from Marielle!

13:41.420 --> 13:43.590
Very well. Master, please teach me.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.490
<i>Fast!</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:45.680
M-Me, too.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.370
All right.

13:47.370 --> 13:50.280
Go! Go! Maidens!

13:50.670 --> 13:53.890
But remember that I'm the center of the galaxy!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.890
That's strange...

13:56.190 --> 13:58.560
Where did Rudy go?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.590
Oh, well.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.030
I'll head back.

14:06.630 --> 14:07.910
Sorry for keeping you.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.160
Naotsugu!

14:09.640 --> 14:12.060
Today's Valentine's Day, you know, right?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.500
Y-Yeah.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.260
So... So...

14:16.890 --> 14:19.170
I made you a present! Candy!

14:19.640 --> 14:20.900
Thanks.

14:23.450 --> 14:27.300
Naotsugu, you know, I... Um...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.680
Lately, I've been thinking...

14:30.160 --> 14:34.340
You have that cute girl in your guild now.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.310
I mean, she doesn't bother me, but...

14:37.970 --> 14:42.150
What kind of girl is your type?

14:42.440 --> 14:43.150
O...

14:43.150 --> 14:44.030
<i>"O"?</i>

14:44.540 --> 14:45.150
O...

14:45.300 --> 14:46.740
<i>"Original style?"</i>

14:47.300 --> 14:48.220
Pa...

14:48.220 --> 14:48.910
<i>"Pa"?</i>

14:48.910 --> 14:49.910
...nti—

14:51.020 --> 14:53.160
What happened, Naotsugu?!

14:53.550 --> 14:55.250
A new type of Royal Guard system?

14:56.650 --> 14:57.790
Akatsuki?

14:57.790 --> 14:59.690
For a second, it looked like you vanished.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.670
You imagined it.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.160
I swear...

15:03.070 --> 15:04.710
Naotsugu's such a jerk!

15:04.710 --> 15:08.580
Even if he wanted to dodge the question, 
there must be better ways to do it!

15:09.410 --> 15:10.380
Shouryuu?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.160
Hi.

15:12.550 --> 15:13.430
Oh, right.

15:13.430 --> 15:14.910
Want some candy?

15:14.910 --> 15:16.520
I made too much.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.270
For me?

15:19.730 --> 15:20.780
Bye.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.650
I-It still makes me happy!

15:24.170 --> 15:25.020
I'm back!

15:25.290 --> 15:26.150
I'm back.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.890
What the hell was that about?

15:28.890 --> 15:29.870
What's wrong?

15:29.870 --> 15:32.340
I just got kicked, out of nowhere.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.050
Welcome back.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.690
That looks good!

15:38.690 --> 15:39.320
Let me take a—

15:39.320 --> 15:40.800
It's not for you!

15:41.610 --> 15:44.790
This is an offering from us to my lord.

15:44.790 --> 15:45.830
For me?

15:45.830 --> 15:46.990
That's right.

15:46.990 --> 15:51.630
These two made this special cake for you.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.310
They made it?

15:53.310 --> 15:55.600
You mean they cooked it?

15:55.960 --> 15:57.330
Indeed.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.990
I gave them the necessary items

15:59.990 --> 16:02.320
and helped a little. That was all.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.860
I cheered them on, too.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.340
Come on!

16:05.340 --> 16:06.730
Sit down.

16:07.980 --> 16:09.820
Stare.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.310
<i>What is going on here?</i>

16:12.310 --> 16:14.460
<i>And I have mild trauma when it comes to cakes.</i>

16:14.460 --> 16:16.330
My lord, hurry.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.830
Please taste it.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.260
Y-Yeah.

16:21.090 --> 16:22.330
I'll try it.

16:27.810 --> 16:28.840
This is...

16:29.250 --> 16:30.410
It's good!

16:30.810 --> 16:31.920
All right!

16:31.920 --> 16:34.040
Isn't that great, Akatsuki?

16:34.040 --> 16:34.470
Yeah.

16:38.210 --> 16:39.040
Meow?

16:39.180 --> 16:40.510
This is it!

16:41.770 --> 16:45.690
<i>This is the Valentine's Day-only 
effect of the coconia fruit.</i>

16:46.350 --> 16:48.770
He'll answer anything we ask him now!

16:48.770 --> 16:50.070
Quickly, quickly!

16:50.670 --> 16:54.000
<i>But what should I ask?</i>

16:54.000 --> 16:55.990
<i>Who he likes?</i>

16:55.990 --> 16:57.920
<i>If it's Akatsuki...</i>

16:58.290 --> 17:00.640
<i>No! I'm too scared to ask!</i>

17:01.050 --> 17:03.900
<i>What if he says "Kanami"?</i>

17:03.900 --> 17:06.430
<i>Who is Kanami, anyway?</i>

17:07.850 --> 17:08.710
It's no use.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.130
I can't do it.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.550
Jeez, that Rudy...

17:11.940 --> 17:14.320
I never did find him.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.600
And I spent all day training. I'm so hungry...

17:18.600 --> 17:19.970
I'm starved.

17:19.970 --> 17:21.980
What's for dinner tonight?

17:24.250 --> 17:26.480
I like curry!

17:29.050 --> 17:32.220
Shiro, we all know that. Why say it?

17:32.980 --> 17:34.760
Did I say something?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.050
That's right.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.240
Okay, let's have curry today, then.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.830
Huh, so Shiroe likes curry more than love, huh?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.220
But you know...

17:45.700 --> 17:47.520
This may have been for the best.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.260
This is for me?

17:52.670 --> 17:53.500
Yes.

17:53.500 --> 17:57.250
I saw them being sold in the market, 
and I thought they were pretty.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.870
<i>I was going to make him some sweets,</i>

18:01.160 --> 18:04.500
<b>Coconia</b>

18:01.870 --> 18:04.140
<i>but coconia fruits were all sold out.</i>

18:04.140 --> 18:08.240
<i>And I couldn't find a Newlywed's 
Apron Dress anywhere...</i>

18:11.820 --> 18:14.110
These flowers have thorns.

18:14.110 --> 18:17.030
Did you pick them just for me?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.280
I'm very grateful.

18:20.690 --> 18:23.780
Oh, we're having curry tonight, by the way.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.990
Why not join us?

18:28.140 --> 18:29.400
Can I?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.820
Of course.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.580
Thank you!

18:32.580 --> 18:34.730
I'll help!

18:34.730 --> 18:36.960
I would appreciate that.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.140
Okay!

18:39.750 --> 18:40.670
I'm back.

18:40.670 --> 18:44.060
Where the heck have you been all day?

18:44.330 --> 18:45.920
Oh, sorry...

18:45.920 --> 18:47.080
I had something to do.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.660
Oh, whatever.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.230
Here.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.490
What is this?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.340
Sweet potato-style coconia fruit.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.820
It's not quite dinnertime, 
but since I made them, try one.

18:58.140 --> 18:59.910
That was nice of you.

18:59.910 --> 19:01.380
Okay, I'll try one.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.830
This is great!

19:04.830 --> 19:06.330
Thanks, Miss Isuzu.

19:06.330 --> 19:07.910
Good!

19:09.040 --> 19:09.580
Huh?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.680
Er... Rudy?

19:12.630 --> 19:15.340
I love you all!

19:15.930 --> 19:16.840
I see.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.350
So it isn't limited to romantic love.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.430
I love you, too, Big Bro Rudy.

19:25.340 --> 19:26.800
I see! I see!

19:26.800 --> 19:28.310
What's gotten into them?

19:28.310 --> 19:29.100
No idea.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.910
Shiro...

19:46.490 --> 19:47.580
Nureha...

19:48.320 --> 19:50.330
You're not using your bed again.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.170
Intix?

19:53.160 --> 19:55.960
Were you thinking about Shiroe?

19:57.200 --> 19:59.090
Were you?

19:59.530 --> 20:01.090
Don't talk about him.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.100
I told you.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.120
I told you, didn't I?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.840
He's no good.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.200
He's a man who can't be connected to any group.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.340
He isn't even a player.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.610
Just powerful interference.

20:16.310 --> 20:19.150
He is not a man you can have.

20:19.150 --> 20:20.800
He's just a traitor.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.530
But he is smart.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.370
You could say he's fastidious.

20:24.650 --> 20:27.370
So he knows the smell of the gutter.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.620
Do you honestly think anyone 
will ever care about you?

20:32.320 --> 20:36.840
Given how dirty, selfish, and ugly you are?

20:36.840 --> 20:37.840
Stop it!

20:40.160 --> 20:42.530
You're covered in lies.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.850
There isn't the tiniest bit of truth in you.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.960
Once someone gets to know you,

20:47.960 --> 20:51.850
they'll find your past smells worse than a sewer.

20:52.460 --> 20:59.360
You, who just kept staring longingly 
at us with that creepy smile...

20:59.680 --> 21:00.610
Stop it!

21:00.610 --> 21:01.990
Please understand.

21:03.100 --> 21:07.330
Don't be arrogant enough to 
think that someone like you

21:07.330 --> 21:09.520
could ever be connected to anyone.

21:09.520 --> 21:15.500
I'm the only one who would make a contract 
with a filthy woman like you.

21:17.930 --> 21:22.470
You're the perfect princess for 
looking at from a distance.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.580
Please realize that things

21:24.580 --> 21:28.100
aren't like they were when this was your salon.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.560
Not here in Plant Hwyaden.

21:31.650 --> 21:35.810
You'll collect lots of wooden dolls 
and make yourself a castle.

21:36.380 --> 21:40.170
And I will gain the entire Yamato server.

21:40.710 --> 21:43.450
That was the deal, right?

21:43.450 --> 21:46.540
You're going to create a place 
where you belong, aren't you?

21:47.480 --> 21:50.550
The Council of Ten Seats is about to begin.

21:51.190 --> 21:54.130
Well, you're only a figurehead,

21:54.130 --> 21:56.340
so just come if you feel like it.

22:01.530 --> 22:02.760
<i>No.</i>

22:03.510 --> 22:05.010
<i>Not anymore,</i>

22:05.950 --> 22:07.210
<i>Intix.</i>

22:07.790 --> 22:10.020
<i>It isn't just about my contract with you.</i>

22:10.650 --> 22:12.020
<i>I...</i>

22:12.390 --> 22:17.160
I can give you what you want more 
easily as a foe than a friend.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.760
I'll be your enemy, whenever you 
decide to find a reason.

22:25.410 --> 22:29.300
I have a promise!

24:06.040 --> 24:07.870
This is the China server.

24:07.870 --> 24:10.840
The chaos of the Apocalypse 
continues across the world.

24:11.160 --> 24:15.960
But one adventurer gathers friends, 
and fights to protect the people.

24:16.510 --> 24:20.640
She is the former leader of 
the Debauchery Tea Party.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.100
Her name is...

24:22.600 --> 24:24.880
Next time: Kanami, Go East.

24:22.600 --> 24:29.940
<b>Kanami, Go East</b>

24:25.490 --> 24:27.290
I have friends to run with me.
