LIKE...LIKE...

09:59.767 --> 10:01.900
WELL, LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S KID!

10:01.900 --> 10:03.567
HAVE THEY
BEEN CHARGED
WITH ANYTHING?

10:03.567 --> 10:04.700
ARE THEY GONNA
HAVE A RECORD?

10:04.700 --> 10:06.400
NO, THE CHARGES
WERE DROPPED

10:06.400 --> 10:08.200
BECAUSE THEY
ARE JUVENILES

10:08.200 --> 10:10.300
AND THERE WAS
NO PRIOR ARREST.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.033
CORY,
THIS ISN'T YOU.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.367
NO, OF COURSE IT ISN'T!

10:14.367 --> 10:16.500
SOMEBODY INFLUENCED HIM,

10:16.500 --> 10:18.100
DIDN'T SOMEONE?

10:19.233 --> 10:20.233
ALAN.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.767
NO, DAD, OK?
YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG.

10:22.767 --> 10:25.100
I--I DID THIS COMPLETELY
ON MY OWN.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.367
COME ON.
YOU'RE COVERING UP
FOR SHAWN,

10:27.367 --> 10:28.600
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.900
NO. I'M NOT.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.934
IN FACT, I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT <i>HIM </i>TO DRINK.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.867
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
STOP PROTECTING ME,
CORY.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.467
YEAH, YOU KNOW HOW LOUSY
HE'S BEEN FEELING.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.734
WELL, HE WANTED
TO FEEL GOOD.

10:39.734 --> 10:40.934
I SHOWED HIM HOW.

10:40.934 --> 10:42.467
SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:42.467 --> 10:43.834
I AM SICK AND TIRED

10:43.834 --> 10:47.300
OF OVERLOOKING
THE INFLUENCE
YOU HAVE ON MY KID.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.800
ALAN,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.367
COME INTO THE OTHER ROOM.

10:51.367 --> 10:54.300
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.100
THAT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD IDEA.

10:56.100 --> 11:00.066
LISTEN, SHAWN,
WH-WHY ARE YOU TAKING
THE RAP FOR ME?

11:00.066 --> 11:01.400
BECAUSE YOUR DAD'S
RIGHT, CORY.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.800
ALL MY LIFE
YOU'VE HAD MY BACK.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.667
JUST LET ME TAKE
THE HEAT THIS TIME.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.600
BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT US INTO TROUBLE.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.667
I'M NOT IN ANY TROUBLE.
YOU ARE.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.967
PEOPLE EXPECT THIS
FROM ME.

11:11.967 --> 11:14.000
I'M--I'M THE SCREW-UP.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.767
YOU'RE
MR. TEENAGE AMERICA.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.100
ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES
OF YOUR PARENTS.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.600
THEY'VE GOT YOU
ON THIS PEDESTAL.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.400
I'M NOT GOING TO
LET YOU FALL OFF.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.500
OK.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.133
THIS IS WHAT
WE THINK.

11:29.133 --> 11:32.700
FIRST, WE FEEL
THAT YOU TWO NEED
SOME TIME APART.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.967
NOW, THIS DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THE FRIENDSHIP
IS OVER.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.000
NO. NO!
FORGET IT, DAD, OK?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
FORGET IT.
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.400
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE CHOICE.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.867
CORY, YOU WERE DRINKING
TONIGHT.

11:44.867 --> 11:46.834
I DON'T CARE, MOM.
DAD DRINKS.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.300
<i>I </i>AM SLIGHTLY OVER
21.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.767
AND WHEN I DO DRINK,
I DRINK RESPONSIBLY,

11:50.767 --> 11:53.100
AND WHEN YOU
ARE READY TO DO
WHAT I DO,

11:53.100 --> 11:56.300
THEN YOU CAN
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE
AND GET A JOB!

11:56.300 --> 11:58.934
WHAT IF KIMBERLY'S PARTY
WASN'T WITHIN
WALKING DISTANCE?

11:58.934 --> 12:00.200
WOULD YOU HAVE DRIVEN?

12:00.200 --> 12:03.100
I--I WOULDN'T
DRINK AND DRIVE.
I'M NOT A MORON.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.700
YOU PEED ON A COP CAR.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.400
HOW SMART IS THAT?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
NOW, LOOK...

12:09.400 --> 12:11.033
I--I APPRECIATE
THE LECTURE,

12:11.033 --> 12:15.100
AND THANKS FOR COMING
TO THE STATION TO PICK ME UP,

12:15.100 --> 12:16.367
BUT YOU'RE NOT MY PARENTS.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.100
AND, YEAH, I'LL JUST
STAY AWAY FROM CORY

12:18.100 --> 12:21.700
IF THAT'S WHAT'S GOING
TO PUT EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.734
NORMAL.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.367
YOU KNOW...

12:24.367 --> 12:26.100
I JUST BROKE UP
WITH SOMEONE

12:26.100 --> 12:29.400
THAT I'VE SPENT
MY ENTIRE LIFE WITH.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.800
I DON'T HAVE A HEART
ANYMORE.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.867
I'VE LOST MY LIFE.

12:34.867 --> 12:38.100
SO <i>I </i>WENT UP
TO YOUR LIQUOR CABINET,

12:38.100 --> 12:43.700
AND <i>I </i>TOOK
A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY...

12:43.700 --> 12:48.467
AND <i>I </i>MADE SHAWN DRINK...

12:48.467 --> 12:51.100
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE ALONE.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.100
SHAWN...

12:58.100 --> 12:59.467
FORGET IT.

12:59.467 --> 13:00.900
NO.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.200
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT MY KID,

13:03.200 --> 13:06.967
AND I SAID SOME THINGS
THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

13:06.967 --> 13:08.600
THAT'S OK.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.367
IT IS NOT OK...

13:11.367 --> 13:14.100
AND I APOLOGIZE.

13:23.967 --> 13:26.033
NO MORE DRINKING?

13:26.033 --> 13:27.367
YEAH.

13:27.367 --> 13:29.934
NO MORE DRINKING.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.400
TOPANGA, LISTEN.
ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT--

13:36.400 --> 13:37.867
CORY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

13:37.867 --> 13:40.467
THERE WAS A REASON
I WAS ACTING SO STRANGE.

13:40.467 --> 13:42.033
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.500
YOU DON'T?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.000
NO.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.133
OK.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.400
IT'S OK WITH YOU
THAT I DON'T CARE?!

13:48.400 --> 13:50.133
NO!

13:50.133 --> 13:53.033
CLASS, AS WE CONTINUE
OUR STUDY OF FEUDALISM,

13:53.033 --> 13:57.033
I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS TODAY
ON THE LIFE OF THE SERF.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.100
MR. HUNTER.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.300
I DON'T WANT TO.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.700
YOU DON'T WANT TO WHAT?

14:01.700 --> 14:02.834
BORING.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.300
IT'S BORING!

14:04.300 --> 14:06.734
THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE
FEUDALISM THING
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

14:06.734 --> 14:09.100
THEY GOT BORED
OUT OF THEIR FREAKIN' MINDS!

14:09.100 --> 14:10.100
HEH HEH.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.133
WHAT?

14:11.133 --> 14:12.200
IT'S TOO FAR.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.400
NO--YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE,

14:13.400 --> 14:16.200
I WOULD LIKE
TO LEARN SOMETHING
SOMEWHAT RELEVANT

14:16.200 --> 14:18.300
TO OUR LIVES.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.100
SHAWN, SHUT UP.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.900
I SAY THIS WITH LOVE.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.100
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

14:23.100 --> 14:25.900
NOTHING. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
STOP BEING SO CRAZY

14:25.900 --> 14:27.000
AND SIT ON CORY'S LAP?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.934
MR. HUNTER,
WE WILL DISCUSS
YOUR OUTBURST

14:29.934 --> 14:31.467
AT THE END OF THE CLASS.

14:31.467 --> 14:34.033
COOL. SO LET
THE BOREDOM BEGIN.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.400
[IMITATES FANFARE]

14:35.400 --> 14:38.667
MR. HUNTER,
PLEASE LEAVE.

14:38.667 --> 14:39.667
OK.

14:39.667 --> 14:43.467
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
YOU ASKED ME SO NICELY.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.667
LISTEN, MR. FEENY,
CAN I--

14:48.667 --> 14:50.567
GO, GO.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.767
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:03.767 --> 15:05.567
I'M SORRY.
DID YOU WANT ONE?

15:05.567 --> 15:09.133
YOU GET KICKED OUT OF CLASS,
YOU FIGHT ME ALL THE WAY HOME,

15:09.133 --> 15:13.200
YOU PUKE ON MY SHOES,
AND YOU STILL WANT
ANOTHER BEER?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.600
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME,
CORY THE MONITOR?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.767
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:16.767 --> 15:19.100
I--I COULD HAVE SWORN
WE AGREED TO STOP DRINKING.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.700
YEAH, WELL, I'VE BEEN
DRINKING ALL WEEK,

15:21.700 --> 15:25.000
AND YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED A THING.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.400
YOU'VE BEEN
DRINKING ALL WEEK?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.700
YEAH. SEE,
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.400
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT ME, YOU STOP
THINKING ABOUT TOPANGA.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.867
BY THE WAY, SHE'S GETTING
OUT OF SCHOOL RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.300
WHY DON'T YOU GO
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM HER AND CRY?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.000
WHAT?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

15:44.867 --> 15:46.233
IT'S A BEER!

15:46.233 --> 15:49.133
WHAT-WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL HERE?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.233
WE GOT DRUNK AT A PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.233
I THINK
HE MIGHT'VE LIKED IT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

15:54.233 --> 15:55.700
YEAH, WELL, A BEER'S
A BIG DEAL FOR US.

15:55.700 --> 15:59.800
OH, GOODY, GOODY.
NOW I GET THE LECTURE
FROM THE BIG BROTHER

15:59.800 --> 16:01.400
WHO I'VE KNOWN
ALL OF 6 MONTHS.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.767
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CLUE, DO YA?

16:02.767 --> 16:03.934
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT DAD!

16:03.934 --> 16:07.100
YEAH. DAD USED TO DRINK,
AND THEN HE STOPPED. NEXT?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.300
YOU KNOW WHY
HE STOPPED DRINKIN'?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.834
BECAUSE HE RAN
OUT OF MONEY?

16:10.834 --> 16:12.467
YOU KNOW WHY
MY MOM LEFT HIM?

16:12.467 --> 16:14.867
'CAUSE SHE WENT
FOR A GUY WITH MORE MONEY?

16:14.867 --> 16:18.300
SHE LEFT HIM BECAUSE
HE WAS AN ABUSIVE,
UGLY DRUNK.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
DON'T YOU EVER TALK
ABOUT MY FATHER--

16:20.300 --> 16:22.233
SHAWN! SHAWN!

16:22.233 --> 16:23.467
STOP!

16:23.467 --> 16:25.500
HE'S MY FATHER,
TOO, MAN!

16:25.500 --> 16:29.133
ALCOHOLISM
IS IN OUR FAMILY,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T DRINK!

16:29.133 --> 16:30.133
SHAWN?

16:30.133 --> 16:31.400
AFTER THE OTHER
NIGHT, SHAWN,

16:31.400 --> 16:33.767
I FEEL LIKE I CAN
NEVER DRINK AGAIN.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.100
YOU WERE DRINKING?

16:35.100 --> 16:38.667
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU FIGURE
THAT WAS ABOUT?

16:38.667 --> 16:39.767
I WONDER!

16:39.767 --> 16:41.600
YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHAWN? SHUT UP.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
OK?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.367
WE AGREED
TO STOP DRINKING.

16:44.367 --> 16:45.367
I HAVE.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.200
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT'S ABOUT?

16:49.400 --> 16:50.734
I WONDER.

16:50.734 --> 16:54.300
AND, BY THE WAY,
I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN
AN ADORABLE DRUNK.

16:54.300 --> 16:58.867
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME.

16:58.867 --> 17:02.100
I DID, YOU WEREN'T,
AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT US.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.667
SHAWN, IT'S OK.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.233
LOOK, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.900
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.500
NOBODY'S LISTENING TO ME.

17:12.500 --> 17:17.834
OK? I--I DRINK THIS STUFF
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.200
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.500
HELLO!

17:22.500 --> 17:25.300
HELLO! IS THIS THING ON?!

17:25.300 --> 17:28.500
I HAVE NO PROBLEM.

17:30.567 --> 17:34.100
OK. MAYBE WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
LET'S JUST GO OUT
INTO THE HALL--

17:36.100 --> 17:37.600
DON'T!

17:40.734 --> 17:44.000
I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU DRINK.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.300
CALL ME WHEN YOU DON'T.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.100
HOW DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.033
HI.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.600
I, UM...

18:15.600 --> 18:17.800
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

18:17.800 --> 18:19.000
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME

18:19.000 --> 18:20.400
HAVING A DRINK ANYMORE.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.500
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO STAY AWAY FROM CORY

18:22.500 --> 18:26.133
BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER
IDIOT STUFF I DO,

18:26.133 --> 18:28.467
I UNDERSTAND.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.400
COME ON IN.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.600
YOU KNOW...

18:36.600 --> 18:40.367
I WOULDN'T
WANT 2 FRIENDS
TO BE KEPT APART.

18:40.367 --> 18:41.400
WHEN I SAID THAT,

18:41.400 --> 18:44.500
I WAS UNDER
THE INFLUENCE
OF ALCOHOL.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.033
YOU WERE DRUNK, TOO?

18:46.033 --> 18:47.767
NO! YOU WERE.

18:47.767 --> 18:51.567
AND SO WAS CORY,
AND I DIDN'T LIKE
SEEING YOU THAT WAY.

18:51.567 --> 18:56.000
YEAH. THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.600
SO, UM...

18:57.600 --> 18:59.800
WHEN CAN CORY
COME OUT AND PLAY?

18:59.800 --> 19:02.500
CAN I, DAD?
HUH? HUH? CAN I?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.600
WHAT MONTH IS IT?

19:04.600 --> 19:05.900
IT'S STILL MARCH.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.133
SORRY, SHAWN.

19:08.133 --> 19:12.033
MAYBE NEXT TIME, YOU WON'T
BE SO EASILY INFLUENCED

19:12.033 --> 19:14.367
BY YOUR ROTTEN FRIENDS!

19:15.734 --> 19:19.867
YEAH, WELL,
HE'S THE ONLY ONE I GOT.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.834
ANGELA HASN'T
CALLED BACK YET?

19:21.834 --> 19:24.367
NO. SHE WON'T RETURN
MY MESSAGES.

19:24.367 --> 19:29.600
I PICKED A FINE TIME
TO QUIT DRINKIN'.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.934
YEAH, I'VE GOT A LOT
OF APOLOGIZING TO DO.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.400
AN APPLE?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.600
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:36.600 --> 19:40.600
WHAT I DID
IN CLASS YESTERDAY
WAS SO OUT OF LINE.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.500
IF--IF YOU WON'T
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY...

19:43.500 --> 19:46.667
THEN I--THEN I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS $12.

19:46.667 --> 19:50.800
THE ONLY THING OF VALUE
FOR ME, MR. HUNTER,

19:50.800 --> 19:53.100
WOULD BE TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.667
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:54.667 --> 19:57.200
YEAH. YEAH,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.033
MY BROTHER AND I, UM,
DECIDED TO TALK TO THIS GUY

20:00.033 --> 20:02.000
WHO'S GONNA
HELP US UNDERSTAND
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.900
GOOD FOR YOU, SHAWN.
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.100
TOPANGA...

20:08.100 --> 20:09.200
I KNOW YOU'RE SORRY.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
I GOT THE CARD
AND THE FRUIT BASKET.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.500
IT WAS MISSING AN APPLE,
BY THE WAY.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.467
RIGHT. HERE.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.900
THANKS.

20:20.867 --> 20:21.900
HOW YA DOIN'?

20:21.900 --> 20:24.400
HEY. WANNA HANG OUT
2 WEEKS FROM THURSDAY?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.500
I'LL BE THERE.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.000
ALL RIGHT.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.367
GOOD MORNING, TOPANGA.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.800
WE CAN'T START OFF
THE DAY LIKE THAT, CORY.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.100
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.100
FINE!

20:34.100 --> 20:35.767
FINE.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.800
HI.
HI.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.467
I DON'T LIKE ME
WHEN I DRINK, EITHER.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.600
GOOD.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.000
BECAUSE I SURE LIKE YOU
WHEN YOU DON'T.
