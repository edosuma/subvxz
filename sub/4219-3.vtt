WEBVTT

00:00.459 --> 00:01.542
Mills!

00:01.669 --> 00:03.086
Peter!

00:03.212 --> 00:04.837
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:04.963 --> 00:06.631
It wasn't a kitchen fire, Chief.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.925
When I was looking at
the Dangerous Buildings map,

00:09.051 --> 00:10.927
it hit me all the targets
were on there.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.261
It's a fire-fighter.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.639
Steady work has been
pretty hard to come by.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.349
Is that why you're setting the fires?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.018
I guess you better prove it.

00:19.144 --> 00:23.898
You get 1%, all for doing nothing
but walking away from our bar.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.318
There's a scotch tasting
happening Friday night.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.654
- Would you wanna join me?
- I'd love to.

00:30.531 --> 00:35.451
Allowing visitors to ride on any of
the apparatus is a serious violation.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.955
- How does she know that?
- There's a snitch in the house.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.958
Fire's coming!

00:42.084 --> 00:44.168
I pled guilty to DUI manslaughter.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.796
Can you take care of Griffin and Ben?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.720
I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, don't kick your backpack.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.139
You're going to smash your lunch.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.099
You guys know the drill, right?

00:58.225 --> 01:01.060
My sister, Christie, is going to pick
you up from school today

01:01.186 --> 01:03.730
and you'll stay at her house tonight,
while I'm on shift.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.398
But tomorrow's our big day,

01:05.524 --> 01:07.567
so I'm going to pick
you up from school early.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.777
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.364
- I told you, I'm not going.
- I know, Griffin.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.241
But you have to.
Griffin!

01:15.367 --> 01:18.745
I'm picking you up early tomorrow,
and that's the end of it.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.456
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.718
Yes! Where was it?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.262
Right where you said,
in the console.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.556
Thank you so much for
driving it over. Thank you.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.851
No worries. Are you rushing
to get away from me again?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.730
Erm...

01:47.316 --> 01:50.109
Look, I was just
in a relationship that...

01:50.235 --> 01:51.652
That fell apart...

01:53.697 --> 01:56.532
- So...
- So I guess this goodbye forever?

02:02.581 --> 02:03.748
I owe you one.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.293
A marker. I like that.
What's it good for?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.755
Come to Molly's tomorrow night
and find out.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.929
Severide! Severide, hey!

02:18.055 --> 02:19.263
- What's up, Otis?
- Nothing.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.849
I was just talking to Shay,
told me the good news.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.393
- Good news?
- Your new apartment. Sounds tight.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.270
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.730
She did say it was a three-bedroom

02:27.856 --> 02:30.566
and you might be looking for
a third roommate to defray the costs.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.109
- She said that?
- Hey, yo! Otis!

02:32.236 --> 02:34.403
We agreed we were going
to come to him together.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.948
Why do you even need a new place, Cruz?
Your apartment isn't bad.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.492
Spend a night in my neighbourhood,
lulled to sleep by gunfire.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.327
Try living two doors
down from my mother.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.205
Now, Severide. This is exactly
the kind of drama

02:44.331 --> 02:48.251
you won't have to deal with if
you choose a mellow, mature roommate.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.087
Guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.047
- I could come by right after shift.
- Me, too.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.092
This isn't cheerleader try-outs.
Work this out amongst yourselves.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.219
Chief! Hey! You got a minute?

02:58.345 --> 02:59.554
Just the one.

02:59.680 --> 03:05.309
Hey... I know who our arsonist is.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.144
Who?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.569
Hadley? No way. I'm not buying it.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.572
I don't want to believe it myself,
but I got a real bad feeling about this.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.242
My old man, he wants to take it
to Arson, but I...

03:21.368 --> 03:22.827
He'd like to get your blessing first.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.621
- You got any proof?
- No, but I...

03:25.747 --> 03:28.499
I had my issues with the man,
but he's a fire-fighter, and a good one.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.459
So you want to accuse him of
starting fires,

03:30.586 --> 03:32.086
you better have
more than a bad feeling.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.382
Squad 3, Ambulance 61,
car in water.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.718
330 West Lower Wacker.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.936
Driver lost control and barrelled
through the guard rail.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.730
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.940
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.053
Give him a tug.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.980
Something's wrong. Try him again.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.650
Rope's caught on something.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.029
Oh, he's off line.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.886
Shay, grab me the monitor.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.015
What happened down there? You OK?

05:49.141 --> 05:50.474
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.204
Why are you two so eager to move in
with Shay and Severide anyway?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.873
The residual tail, Mouch.

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
The what now?

06:16.168 --> 06:19.462
OK, between Severide and Shay,
think about how many beautiful women

06:19.588 --> 06:21.380
are gonna be parading
through the apartment.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.342
Imagine it. Severide's out at a bar,
he's chatting up some babe.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.510
She's got a friend.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.512
- Uh-oh.
- Fun doesn't have to stop there.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.680
All he has to say is,

06:29.806 --> 06:33.684
"Let's go back to my place where we can
hang out with my awesome roommate, Joe."

06:33.810 --> 06:35.895
- "Brian."
- Pathetic.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.189
OK, Mouch,
why do you want to be their roommate?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.318
I've been lonely since Mari left.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.153
Oh, yeah,
that's not pathetic at all.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.613
Great news, Otis.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.991
I just got our beer distributor
to comp us two kegs for the promotion.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.411
- Way to hustle, Herrmann.
- Good beer or cheap beer?

06:52.537 --> 06:53.704
Free beer.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.167
Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures
to secure my nomination.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.544
Relax, alright?
We'll get there.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.508
You should meet my friend Isabella.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.385
She spent the last two years in DC
working for some congressman

07:08.512 --> 07:11.514
and she's back home now trying to start
up her own political consulting firm.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.226
That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for POTUS.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.520
Thank you, Gabriela.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.022
I would very much like
to meet your friend.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.441
- Wait, hold on. Is she hot?
- She's straight.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.741
Hey, Mills, erm,
have you got a sec?

07:30.867 --> 07:31.951
Yeah. What's up?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.661
My pop's out on the apron.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.372
He wants to come in,
but doesn't want to disrespect you.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.625
- So, if you want him to stay outside...
- Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.296
He's here to help out with
the arson investigation.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.178
OK.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.603
Where I come from,
you get in a fight,

07:59.729 --> 08:03.357
you shake each other's hands afterwards
and you put it behind you.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.110
I can do that if you can.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.782
- I like you, kid. You remind me of...
- That doesn't make us buddies.

08:12.993 --> 08:17.496
Just find the son of a bitch
who torched my mom's diner. OK?

08:22.669 --> 08:24.712
Just tell me why you think
I should give you my blessing

08:24.838 --> 08:26.297
to investigate Kevin Hadley.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.465
There's a well-established
psychological profile

08:28.592 --> 08:31.886
for fire-fighter arsonists,
and Hadley fits it to a T.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.097
They tend to be white and male.
They come from broken homes.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.433
Hadley's father abandoned them
when he was 13.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.684
They're usually unmarried.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.686
They lack stable
interpersonal relationships.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.688
You saw the way he blew
everything up around here.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.482
You're talking about half the
fire-fighters I know, including you.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.484
Chief, it's Hadley right down the list.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.905
So you think he's motivated by anger
over getting kicked out of 51?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.740
You told him he wasn't worthy
of this house,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.575
so he's trying to prove you wrong.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.203
Show you that he's smarter than you are.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.414
And he isn't going to stop
until someone's dead.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.253
Chief, you should know that
I... I confronted Hadley about this.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.132
Really? What did he say?

09:11.968 --> 09:13.928
He said, "Prove it."

09:20.268 --> 09:22.686
Hey, Pete.
How's your mom doing?

09:22.812 --> 09:27.691
OK, trying to decide if she should
rebuild or just call it quits.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.694
Tell her we're going to take
this arsonist down.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.071
She knows.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.532
We'll draw straws for the third bedroom.

09:35.659 --> 09:39.453
No! No, there is now way I am
leaving this up to random chance.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.538
It ought to be about who wants it most.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.541
We should have a contest.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.588
Dude... the cinnamon challenge.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.424
Where you try to eat a spoonful of
cinnamon in under 60 seconds?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.592
Exactly!

09:53.718 --> 09:55.094
You mean the Internet craze

09:55.220 --> 09:57.304
that lands people in hospital
with a collapsed lung?

09:57.430 --> 10:01.183
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we, a bunch of frat boys?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.567
It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.444
They told you about Hadley?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.573
What about Hadley?

10:20.287 --> 10:26.917
Er... Kelly thinks Hadley's
the one responsible for the arson fires.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.043
What?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.463
Shay, are you serious?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.394
I'll talk to him.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.480
This is Matt.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.483
Yeah, why?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.070
Chief, I need a big favour.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.865
- I've got to go out for half an hour.
- After you were late this morning?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.659
Yeah, I know, Chief,
but can Herrmann cover

11:00.785 --> 11:02.328
as acting officer while I'm gone?

11:02.454 --> 11:03.996
You need a lieutenant
to cover for you.

11:04.122 --> 11:08.375
- I need that paperwork on my desk.
- Chief, it's half an hour.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.213
- There better be a damn good reason.
- There is.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.760
Thanks!

11:33.360 --> 11:36.153
Believe me, Griffin and I
are going to have a long talk

11:36.279 --> 11:37.696
the minute I get off shift.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.740
- This won't happen again.
- I have to say, Matt,

11:39.866 --> 11:43.619
this whole child care situation doesn't
exactly instil me with confidence.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.830
- Well, we're making the best of it.
- There are other options.

11:46.956 --> 11:51.502
Not for me. I have an obligation
to Heather and her late husband.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.713
Matt, your only obligation
is to Griffin and Ben.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.175
You need to make sure
they have constant, proper guidance.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.428
If I feel like you can't provide that
while you're working 24-hour shifts,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.765
then I have to share
my concerns with DCFS.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.685
- Hello?
- Dawson?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.563
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, you are?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.190
I'm Gabby Dawson.
I'm with Matt.

12:16.736 --> 12:21.407
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry, I'm still on duty.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.201
- You OK?
- Hey.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.787
Erm...

12:28.832 --> 12:31.250
This isn't like Griffin at all.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.043
Obviously, he's acting out.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.505
Erm, in the span of a year,
he's lost his father,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.715
and his mother's been taken away.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.552
But he'll get there.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.597
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here,

12:45.723 --> 12:48.267
and that we love him,

12:48.393 --> 12:52.980
and it's OK to feel
whatever he's feeling right now.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.988
Thank you. That's, er...

13:01.114 --> 13:03.240
That's just what
I was about to tell Matt.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.543
Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.462
But you're so glad I did.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.175
Griffin, what are you doing?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.051
You can't just go around hitting kids.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.722
Alright, we'll talk later,
when I pick you up early tomorrow.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.140
You can't. I have detention.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.477
It's not like I'm trying to drag
you along to pick up my dry cleaning.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.479
This is a big deal.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.398
Later.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.362
Matt, if you engage in
a battle of wills with an 11-year-old,

13:42.489 --> 13:43.489
you're going to lose.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.616
So, what, I'm supposed to back down?

13:45.742 --> 13:50.329
No. No, you just back off a little.
Let him come to you.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.166
Oh! Good afternoon, Chief.

13:55.835 --> 14:00.422
Ms McLeod, come right in.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.552
Erm, listen, a Kevin Hadley

14:05.678 --> 14:08.597
was dismissed from your house
earlier this year. Is that correct?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.768
Why is Arson discussing
ongoing investigations

14:12.894 --> 14:14.394
with an outside consultant?

14:14.521 --> 14:17.940
The reasons for his transfer are vague.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.274
Why'd you force him out?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.944
I don't believe that's your business.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.904
Chief, all due respect,

14:24.030 --> 14:27.950
if one of your former men is now
setting fires all over this city,

14:28.076 --> 14:30.494
it doesn't exactly cast
your leadership abilities

14:30.620 --> 14:31.870
in the most flattering light.

14:32.580 --> 14:37.334
Kevin Hadley exhibited unacceptable
behaviour toward another fire-fighter.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.504
He couldn't remain in the house.
I showed him the door.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.340
Without filing a grievance
with Human Resources?

14:43.466 --> 14:45.092
I opted not to report his behaviour.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.136
My aim was to get the man out of
the house, not to ruin his career.

14:49.764 --> 14:53.058
So you let his unacceptable
behaviour go unreported,

14:53.184 --> 14:56.270
and now he's targeting 51
with arson fires.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.065
OK, well, thank you, Chief.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.609
I just needed to get
some clarification on that.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.820
- You have a good day.
- Yeah.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.828
- How's it going, Clarke?
- Cruz.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.164
So, a bunch of us are going
to Molly's tomorrow.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.709
- You should join us.
- Yeah?

15:18.835 --> 15:22.212
Sure, tip back a few beers,
get to know us all a bit better.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.722
What's a movie from 1985
starring Cher?

15:31.848 --> 15:34.891
- Four letters.
- I don't know. Addams Family?

15:35.977 --> 15:38.812
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at Molly's.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.149
Your wife, too. Bring her along.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.576
Hey, Capp,
can I borrow you for a second?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.745
Alright, just go slow.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.246
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.540
You're sure about this?
It's going to destroy the ring.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.127
Or maybe we can
get it off with olive oil.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.506
My wife moved out back in August.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.508
So, I don't need the ring any more.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.137
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. What are you going to do?

16:14.390 --> 16:17.768
- Keep that under your hat, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.895
2051 West Potomac.

16:20.021 --> 16:25.442
So, I just pretended
to be Casey's girlfriend.

16:27.654 --> 16:32.574
Erm, anyway, it's kind of a long story,
but the point is, it wasn't a big deal.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.620
I mean, I wasn't like,
nervous or awkward or anything.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.956
I'm content just being his friend.

16:40.083 --> 16:44.127
Wow, you're really
into this Jay guy, aren't you?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.380
Yeah, I think I am.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.259
OK, here we go.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.096
What are we looking at?

16:54.222 --> 16:58.558
Over here! My buddy, Chris
he's got a little... problem.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.524
Yep. That's a problem.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.909
OK, one nail I get.
But four?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.662
He disabled the safety on his nail gun
so it would shoot rapid fire.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.206
A real time-saver.
They're in pretty tight.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.250
Hey, Dawson, should we call a truck?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.168
I don't know,
he's already going into shock.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.337
Do you have a saw?
We need to cut this board free.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.505
Yeah, here.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.675
Whoa, oh.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.887
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.098
Cut it as short as you can.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.854
It's vibrating!

17:43.980 --> 17:45.480
Sorry, man! Are you OK?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.566
He's won't be OK
until we get him to a hospital.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.109
- Keep cutting.
- I can't. I can't.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.278
You're not amputating an arm,
it's a piece of wood.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.655
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.213
OK, stand up, nice and easy.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.590
Here you go. Stay close to me.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.303
Oh, and you guys should be
wearing eye protection.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.516
Alright, this is an IPA.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.059
Give it a taste.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.270
It's not bad, right?

18:25.396 --> 18:26.980
We got a whole slew
of different stuff...

18:27.106 --> 18:29.483
I'm telling you, girl,
you'd love Daft Punk.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.027
Get Lucky.
Oh, you're kidding me?

18:32.153 --> 18:33.403
The guys with the crazy helmets!

18:33.529 --> 18:37.324
Oh! Is that the horsey-riding song?
The...

18:37.450 --> 18:40.285
Oh, God no. No.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.996
You know what, girl? You are about
to have your horizons broadened.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.916
I am going to make you a mix CD.
Just you wait.

18:46.042 --> 18:51.046
Hey, Cruz, Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.800
We're not really going to
do this thing, are we?

18:54.926 --> 18:57.385
Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.805
People came out here to watch.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.850
You know what? I don't need
the apartment that bad. I'm out.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.938
Looks like it is down
to you and me, Cruz.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.856
May the best man win.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.525
Dude, this is ground cumin.

19:14.946 --> 19:18.990
Oh, shoot. Hey, they're right
next to each other on the shelf.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.117
Hey, Mouch, I want you
to meet my girl, Isabella.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.538
Ah, the king maker, huh?
I've heard a lot about you.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.792
And I about you. Sounds like
you could use some campaign help.

19:30.545 --> 19:35.006
Nice, firm grip. Nobody ever won
an election with clammy hands.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.343
The secret is,
I wipe my palm on my pants.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.137
So, talk to me about
your campaign strategy.

19:41.264 --> 19:46.476
Er, we just started talking
about strategies, actually...

19:46.602 --> 19:49.062
- Cute.
- Indeed.

19:49.814 --> 19:50.939
Here, try this one.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.774
Who is this guy?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.819
Oh, that? That's Jay.
He's sort of a regular now.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.779
They're...
They're just friends...

19:57.905 --> 20:01.783
It's cool, Otis. I can handle it.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.870
It's good.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.497
She looks happy.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.800
- Who's in charge in here?
- He is.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.469
Hey, how you doing, officers?

20:21.596 --> 20:24.055
Come back after shift
and try the Autumn Ale.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.016
We got a complaint from
one of your neighbours.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.768
- You're kidding me. Who complained?
- You know I can't tell you that.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.854
You're going to have
to shut this booth down.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.814
No, no, no.
I cleared this with the city.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.484
I got a permit that says
we can hold an outdoor event.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.029
- We're on the up and up.
- This isn't about permits.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.657
"Unlimited beer tasting, ten dollars."
That's a violation of happy hour laws.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.368
You can't serve unlimited alcohol
for a set price.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.912
Shut it down or get fined.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.372
Alright.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.209
Game Day.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.340
Sorry folks.
We've got to shut it down.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.097
You want to go to Defcon 5,
Game Day?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.934
I can go to Defcon 5.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.730
Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.399
- Shut up, Otis.
- OK.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.279
What does that mean exactly?
They put him on their list of suspects?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.615
It means that they're taking
our suspicions seriously.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.660
They'll dig into Hadley's background,
maybe bring him in for questioning.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.912
What they ought to do is
keep an eye on him 24-7.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.372
They need to catch him in the act.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.541
Arson Investigation doesn't have the
manpower for that kind of surveillance.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.710
I got time on my hands.
I'll stake out his place.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.545
You start meddling with
the investigation,

21:37.672 --> 21:40.548
you could put their case on
very shaky procedural grounds.

21:40.675 --> 21:43.093
Please, just let Al handle it, OK?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.264
Wow, hey. This is a nice place
you found here, Leslie.

21:48.391 --> 21:52.268
Thank you. And thanks so much
for helping out. I feel bad.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.354
You probably want to get back
to Beth and the kids.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.481
No, no, it's OK.
Anyway, Kelly needs me.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.694
Well, come on, between these arson fires

22:00.820 --> 22:03.113
and Renee pulling the rug
out from under you.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.907
You're having trouble at home,
aren't you?

22:09.453 --> 22:13.748
Well, Beth and I are taking
a little break right now.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.709
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's going to be fine.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.211
I'm driving back to Kenosha
every weekend.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.255
It'll work out, OK?

22:23.384 --> 22:26.261
Hey, can you give me a hand
with the coffee table?

22:28.597 --> 22:33.184
We were doing pretty good there
till Officer Friendly showed up.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.021
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.523
And remember, Arthur's going to show up
at the end of the week

22:38.649 --> 22:39.899
to collect his share of that.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.776
Great, thanks for reminding me.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.903
Arthur is this wannabe mobster

22:44.030 --> 22:46.239
who weaselled his way into
a silent partnership.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.074
Total leech.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.618
Hey, go home, Herrmann.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.996
You've been on your feet all day.
I'll finish cleaning up.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.164
Thanks, Dawson.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.667
Maybe I'll go pour myself
a nice, big tall glass of antifreeze.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.340
Night.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.309
Do you want a hand with the glasses?

23:18.773 --> 23:21.191
Yeah, we could wash the glasses...

23:22.943 --> 23:28.573
...or we could let them soak a while.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.637
You need anything, Gabby?

23:50.763 --> 23:54.140
- Sorry, what?
- You want some toast or something?

23:55.351 --> 23:58.186
Oh, no, sorry. I'm great. Thanks.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.897
- See, you just got retweeted.
- Amazing.

24:01.023 --> 24:04.442
Dawson, I owe you big time.
Isabella is a real find.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.777
What's going on?

24:05.903 --> 24:08.071
I set Randy up with
a social media presence

24:08.197 --> 24:10.698
so he can reach out to
the online CFD community.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.451
Now he can gather
endorsements electronically.

24:13.577 --> 24:17.288
I only need 120 more signatures,
and I'm on the ballot.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.832
That's great!

24:18.958 --> 24:22.335
Where's Herrmann? He should see this.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.380
Thanks so much for doing this.

24:25.506 --> 24:29.175
It's great practise, and if I can
get Randy elected union president,

24:29.301 --> 24:31.386
that'll really help me
establish myself in Chicago.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.805
- Yeah.
- Plus, it's no chore

24:33.931 --> 24:37.058
hanging around a firehouse,
if you know what I mean.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.519
Think Pete over there
has a thing for me.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.151
Oh, he's your ex.
Gabby, I didn't realise.

24:46.277 --> 24:49.028
- Don't worry, he's off limits.
- No, no.

24:50.948 --> 24:55.618
Actually, you know what?
He's fair game.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.413
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.250
Can I have your attention, please?

25:02.376 --> 25:09.174
As per a discussion I have just had
our consultant friend, Ms McLeod,

25:09.300 --> 25:12.969
from here on out, anyone who must leave
a shift for personal reasons,

25:13.095 --> 25:14.929
you need to submit a request

25:15.055 --> 25:18.558
and allow enough time for
a relief to be brought in.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.019
Absolutely no exceptions.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.235
By the way...

25:31.155 --> 25:36.534
...Otis, cinnamon challenge?
Are you out of your mind?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.370
Oh, it's cool, Chief.
We're going to have a paramedic present.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.581
You are a fire-fighter
with the city of Chicago

25:41.707 --> 25:45.752
and you are promoting a dangerous stunt
that has filled emergency rooms

25:45.878 --> 25:49.547
with victims
who are stupid enough to try it!

25:57.806 --> 25:59.641
Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?

25:59.767 --> 26:03.853
- We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
- I didn't think so.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.907
How is she finding out all this stuff?

26:16.033 --> 26:19.869
I know she doesn't subscribe
to your podcast.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.084
Can I have your attention, please?

26:26.210 --> 26:28.795
I got an announcement to make, too.
Just a heads-up.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.382
Lately we've been finding rat turds
all over the house.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.968
Seems that we have an infestation.

26:35.094 --> 26:39.055
Finkus Backstabberis,
better known as the common snitch.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.473
Not to fear, though.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.477
These disgusting vermin don't
typically last long at 51.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.938
Something you want to say to me?

26:47.064 --> 26:50.566
Just putting it out there, Clarke.
A general warning.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.779
Well, maybe I should give you
a very specific warning.

26:54.905 --> 27:00.076
- Come on. Come on.
- Hey! Enough. Enough!

27:01.203 --> 27:02.537
Enough of this.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.250
You've got to be kidding me.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.726
Good old 51, I've missed this place.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.145
- Easy, Mills.
- How's everyone been?

27:28.397 --> 27:31.691
- What are you doing here?
- Just want to buy a T-shirt.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.693
Got to support the local firehouse,
right?

27:33.819 --> 27:37.447
Get out, before I carry you out.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.116
Why, so you can keep
spreading lies about me?

27:40.242 --> 27:42.035
What can we help you with, Hadley?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.620
That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything,

27:44.747 --> 27:46.289
this is the last place
I'll look for it.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.125
Hey, buddy, new guy!

27:49.251 --> 27:50.460
Watch your back around here.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.756
Word to the wise.

27:56.508 --> 28:01.763
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.557
House fire.
South California and Madison.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.381
It's a condemned house,
structurally unsound.

28:36.507 --> 28:40.718
- He's setting another trap for us.
- Yeah. No doubt.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.303
I'm gonna hold off.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.972
Truck 81, Squad 3, stand down.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.308
Engine 51,
hit it with your water cannon.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.434
Nobody goes inside.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.895
We gonna let this one burn
to the ground if we have to.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.025
Dawson! Shay!

28:56.151 --> 28:59.362
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy,
hold still. Hold still. Don't move.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.573
My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.451
- Send me and Capp in.
- That fire is in the structure.

29:05.577 --> 29:09.080
We'll do one rapid primary search
and we'll get out.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.540
You got one minute.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.375
Capp! Come on, let's move!

29:12.501 --> 29:14.627
Herrmann, Mills!
Get them a straight ladder.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.337
You got it.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.762
- Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.
- My girlfriend's inside.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.389
They're looking for her right now, OK?

29:26.515 --> 29:28.182
If she's still up there,
they'll find her.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.518
- She's not upstairs!
- What?

29:30.644 --> 29:31.894
She woke me up,

29:32.020 --> 29:34.397
said she smelled something funny
coming from the basement.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.607
I think she went back down there.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.069
Chief! We got a problem!

29:43.157 --> 29:45.616
Severide, get out of there!
She is not upstairs!

29:45.742 --> 29:48.578
- Get out of there now!
- Copy that! Capp!

29:49.329 --> 29:52.415
Spellman, get a crew in the back door
with a one-and-three-quarter-inch hose.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.459
Clear a path for the truck
to get into the basement.

29:54.585 --> 29:55.626
On it, Chief.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.044
- Mills!
- Yeah?

30:05.679 --> 30:07.555
Fire Department! Call out!

30:13.520 --> 30:15.146
Lieutenant!

30:19.318 --> 30:20.860
We got her!

30:31.955 --> 30:33.414
Chief, we're cut off!

30:33.540 --> 30:36.751
We're going to need help getting
out of the side window in sector four!

30:36.877 --> 30:39.795
51, bring a ladder to sector four!

30:43.509 --> 30:45.635
Move! They don't have long!

30:52.809 --> 30:54.769
Alright, ready? Go!

31:00.692 --> 31:02.235
Got her.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.073
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.955
Mills, you first.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.044
Lift her head up.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.129
On three. One, two, three!

31:22.256 --> 31:25.299
We need saline and an IO drill
and burn sheets. Lots of them.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.649
Severide.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.159
Take it easy, Severide!

31:52.286 --> 31:54.120
You almost killed that girl,
you son of a bitch!

31:54.246 --> 31:56.956
She's going to spend the next six months
in the burn unit because of you!

31:57.082 --> 31:59.542
This is insanity. I just followed
you over here to watch you work.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.919
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.547
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.508
Severide! Severide!

32:07.634 --> 32:12.054
You know what? Keep your lousy T-shirt.

32:22.024 --> 32:25.610
Let's go! We've got a fire to fight.

32:30.157 --> 32:34.368
Alright, we're going to go inside,
and sign us in,

32:34.494 --> 32:37.204
then we'll walk through a metal
detector, just like at the airport.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.415
They'll take us to a visiting room,

32:39.541 --> 32:42.710
and then the guards will bring
your mom in to sit and talk.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.421
She'll be wearing
kind of a funny jumpsuit,

32:45.547 --> 32:48.758
and maybe she won't have
on any make-up,

32:48.884 --> 32:50.843
but she's still your mom,
and she still loves you.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.261
Can we just get on with it?

32:54.264 --> 32:59.602
Griffin, listen to me.
I've been where you are.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.147
I know it's not easy
to see your mom this way

33:03.273 --> 33:06.984
but you have no idea what a great thing
it is you're doing for her.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.987
You two are all she has right now.

33:11.156 --> 33:14.742
So keep being brave. For her.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.203
OK.

33:17.329 --> 33:22.458
- Right. Ready?
- Yeah.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.460
OK. Let's go.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.201
Mama!

33:58.161 --> 33:59.578
Mama!

33:59.705 --> 34:01.539
Hey!

34:15.887 --> 34:18.931
So I got to sit there
and listen to this guy Rome from Arson

34:19.057 --> 34:22.560
and my old man lecture me about how
I'm playing right into Hadley's hands.

34:22.686 --> 34:25.312
That I'm giving him
the attention he craves.

34:25.439 --> 34:26.689
What do they expect you to do?

34:26.815 --> 34:29.108
They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess,

34:29.234 --> 34:30.526
I don't know, and slips up.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.696
- What, or kills someone?
- That's... Yes, that's what I said.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.074
I mean,
Hadley worked under me for two years.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.826
I should've seen this coming.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.704
Whoa, look, Kelly,
don't put yourself through that.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.913
It's not your fault.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.166
I'm just sick and tired of
waiting for bells to go off.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.376
We need to stop reacting
and start anticipating.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.502
That's what we need to do.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.130
No, what we need to do
is let Arson handle this,

34:51.256 --> 34:53.758
and you and I need
to go somewhere and get drunk.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.468
Come on. I'm buying.

34:56.178 --> 35:00.556
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Come on. God, you cheap ass!

35:00.682 --> 35:03.934
- Come on.
- Come on, Otis, we got drinks to serve.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.230
This'll only take a minute.
You're going to love it. Trust me.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.695
- Otis.
- Yes?

35:14.821 --> 35:19.742
Did you call the Fire Marshal to report
an over-capacity crowd at Game Day?

35:19.868 --> 35:22.411
I don't know what you're talking about,
Christopher.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.458
What are you guys doing?

35:27.584 --> 35:30.044
I think Otis just took us to Defcon 1.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.839
Right this way, folks!

35:33.965 --> 35:36.008
We've got half-priced drinks
till nine o'clock!

35:36.134 --> 35:40.888
- Come on in!
- Go get 'em! I'm getting out of here.

35:42.140 --> 35:48.354
- Hey.
- Joe, you burn me a CD?

35:48.480 --> 35:52.358
Aw. You are adorable.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.988
What's up, Cruz?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.619
Everything alright?

36:45.745 --> 36:50.749
He wants you to promise
you won't go away, like Mom and Dad.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.047
I'm right here, guys.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.800
I'm not going anywhere.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.112
- Where's Zoya?
- No idea.

37:20.238 --> 37:26.368
OK, so, due to liability concerns,
we had to ixnay the cinnamon challenge.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.747
But, fear not, for Joe Cruz and I

37:29.873 --> 37:35.502
are going to attempt
the saltine cracker challenge,

37:35.629 --> 37:39.173
where we will attempt to eat
six crackers in under a minute

37:39.299 --> 37:41.926
with not a drop of water.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.720
No, no, no.
It's going to be awesome, trust me.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.014
OK. Here we go.

37:54.731 --> 37:59.401
You can take the third bedroom.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.613
- I'm out.
- Really?

38:06.660 --> 38:09.870
Yeah! Yeah!

38:13.166 --> 38:18.545
All I ask is that you don't sit idly by
while Greg Sullivan runs unopposed.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.798
Your signature will
help put me on the ballot,

38:20.924 --> 38:23.384
make sure we have
a real choice at the voting booth.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.094
Thank you, Tony.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.223
He's like a new man.

38:29.349 --> 38:33.394
Give me a lump of clay
and I'll mould it into a masterpiece.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.565
We're about to get
our last few signatures.

38:38.692 --> 38:43.445
- Do you want to celebrate later?
- Yeah, sounds like fun.

38:45.365 --> 38:49.034
- Er, do you realise that Gabby and I...
- Gabby and I talked.

38:50.620 --> 38:53.288
- She's cool with it.
- Really?

39:01.881 --> 39:04.299
- Interesting.
- We did it!

39:04.426 --> 39:06.510
200 hundred signatures.
We made the deadline.

39:06.636 --> 39:11.473
I am on the ballot!

39:12.600 --> 39:15.811
You and me, buddy!
We're going all the way. Wow!

39:15.937 --> 39:17.563
Well, well, well.

39:17.689 --> 39:23.527
How about this crowd, huh? Things are
really looking up around here, huh?

39:23.653 --> 39:24.987
So?

39:29.492 --> 39:34.079
Hey, Dawson, get Arthur his dough,
so he can be on his way.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.427
- Some kind of joke?
- That's 1%, per our agreement.

39:49.512 --> 39:54.016
- What, you want an audit?
- No, tough guy. I don't want an audit.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.477
I want a new deal.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.688
See, er, my man Jay here...

40:01.900 --> 40:04.068
...he's been assessing your business.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.781
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?

40:18.792 --> 40:25.047
So... when you said that
you were working construction,

40:25.173 --> 40:27.925
you meant you were working for Arthur?

40:29.552 --> 40:32.179
- Look...
- You came here to spy on us?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.021
Get out of my bar.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.984
Now!
