01:00.479 --> 01:01.530
Let's go in.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.200
Goodness, look at these hyenas.

01:06.739 --> 01:09.239
It's okay. It's all right.

01:10.329 --> 01:12.739
Hey, Hyun Soo. It's okay.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.688
Look at me, Hyun Soo.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.450
Hey, Hyun Soo.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.238
This walk-through isn't about winning or losing.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.200
It's like a stage play, okay?

01:55.620 --> 01:58.290
They'll do whatever it takes to provoke you...

01:58.579 --> 02:00.170
to shake you all up.

02:00.879 --> 02:02.790
Do not react to the things they say or show you.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.629
Just think of it as a stage play and watch them.

02:08.590 --> 02:09.680
Okay?

02:11.180 --> 02:12.259
Yes?

02:16.639 --> 02:17.680
Okay.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.900
Prosecutor, please proceed.

02:24.569 --> 02:26.400
This walk-through of the scene...

02:26.530 --> 02:27.779
will be conducted...

02:27.780 --> 02:30.699
by Chief Park Sang Bum from Chungang Police Station.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.960
Let's begin.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.349
The accused and the victim...

02:53.969 --> 02:56.770
drank together right here.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.479
As you can see,

03:00.139 --> 03:02.099
they almost finished an entire bottle of tequila.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.859
LSD and ketamine...

03:06.860 --> 03:08.739
are the two drugs that they took.

03:08.740 --> 03:10.698
- Chief Park, look here! - Look at the camera.

03:10.699 --> 03:11.780
Over here!

03:18.580 --> 03:19.789
Hey, boyfriend.

03:41.979 --> 03:43.979
Around midnight,

03:44.060 --> 03:45.649
the accused, who was drunk,

03:45.650 --> 03:47.770
started sexually assaulting the victim.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.030
He undressed the victim.

03:54.699 --> 03:55.870
Be more brutal.

03:57.699 --> 03:59.789
The victim strongly resisted.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.370
So in the end,

04:02.159 --> 04:04.580
he began to threaten her with this knife.

04:06.919 --> 04:09.339
The victim got these cuts on her palm...

04:09.340 --> 04:11.509
while tussling with the accused.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.888
And these are the traces that he left...

04:15.889 --> 04:18.560
while attempting to destroy evidence immediately after the incident.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.889
They started...

04:21.889 --> 04:23.269
right here,

04:25.399 --> 04:26.769
and through this staircase,

04:27.399 --> 04:28.730
they went upstairs.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.860
Let's go upstairs now.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.779
After taking down the victim,

04:37.490 --> 04:40.870
the accused pushed her onto the bed and tried to rape her.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.790
In this process,

04:45.170 --> 04:48.420
this lamp here was knocked to the floor.

04:49.129 --> 04:51.000
The victim continued to resist.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.378
So the accused, who was furious, stabbed her...

04:53.379 --> 04:56.719
on the right side of the neck and the left side of the chest.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.509
He stabbed her twice.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.189
Then he flipped the victim, who had no strength left to fight back,

05:06.439 --> 05:08.560
and stabbed her ten times in the back.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.110
As you can see, the stab wounds in this horrible photo...

05:14.319 --> 05:17.319
are the result of this.

06:48.079 --> 06:50.290
Hyun Soo. Hey, what's wrong?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.250
The nebulizer!

06:53.500 --> 06:55.208
Does anyone have a nebulizer?

06:55.209 --> 06:56.878
- The nebulizer! - Call an ambulance!

06:56.879 --> 06:58.089
Get me a nebulizer.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.378
What are you doing? Get lost, jerk!

07:00.379 --> 07:02.469
Hey, breathe!

07:02.470 --> 07:04.009

07:30.410 --> 07:34.000
Drinking, smoking, stress, and dealing with trashy reporters.

07:34.170 --> 07:37.420
Guess what's the worst for the skin out of the four things.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.379
Gosh, watch what you say.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.758
I'm no trashy reporter.

07:40.759 --> 07:43.339
He was on the verge of death,

07:43.889 --> 07:46.049
yet you were busy getting that all on camera.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.349
That's pure trash.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.850
I call that a strong work ethic.

07:50.389 --> 07:52.479
Despite the weather, dozens of civilians came...

07:52.480 --> 07:54.188

07:54.189 --> 07:56.019
conduct a walk-through of the scene.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.669
You didn't suffer a cardiac arrest,

08:21.670 --> 08:23.089
so don't worry about the complications.

08:23.759 --> 08:26.180
If everything's okay tonight, you can be discharged tomorrow.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.310
Don't forget to take the nebulizer.

08:49.409 --> 08:51.659
I think you're putting on an act.

08:54.039 --> 08:57.960
That was the best choice you could make at that moment.

09:01.629 --> 09:04.379

09:05.759 --> 09:08.929

but as you can see,

11:24.559 --> 11:26.820
I look terrible.

12:33.179 --> 12:34.929
You weren't able to administer the test,

12:35.009 --> 12:38.509
so how did you know that he was drunk?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.480
He had lost focus in his eyes,

12:42.139 --> 12:43.940
and he reeked of alcohol.

12:45.190 --> 12:47.110

If I'm correct,

13:48.710 --> 13:51.169
you must offer water during a breathalyzer test.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.590
Did you?

13:53.759 --> 13:55.970
What? No.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.049
We were just clearing the DUI checkpoint.

13:59.299 --> 14:00.299
I see.

14:00.850 --> 14:03.058
And due to the battery dying,

14:03.059 --> 14:05.139
you weren't able to administer a breathalyzer test.

14:24.370 --> 14:26.539
and a breathalyzer test wasn't administered,

14:27.120 --> 14:30.039
but you still took him to the station.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.259

- Yes. - So answer me.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.179
How many unlawful acts...

14:48.769 --> 14:49.940
did you commit that night?

14:51.019 --> 14:53.360
- What? - Unlawful acts?

14:54.070 --> 14:55.230
Is the woman...

14:56.360 --> 14:57.610
dead?

14:59.610 --> 15:00.700
Is the woman...

15:01.909 --> 15:03.070
dead?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.159
"Is the woman dead?"

15:09.710 --> 15:11.210
What went through your mind...

15:11.669 --> 15:12.878
when you heard that question?

15:12.879 --> 15:16.210
At the time, I didn't think too much of it.

15:16.879 --> 15:19.589
But when we found the knife in his jacket,

15:19.590 --> 15:21.008
I realized what he meant.

15:21.009 --> 15:22.139
Which was what?

15:22.639 --> 15:24.889
I believed he was seeking confirmation.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.559
So you're saying that he checked...

15:27.850 --> 15:29.558
to see if the victim had died.

15:29.559 --> 15:30.559
That's right.

15:32.809 --> 15:33.809
That will be all.

15:35.070 --> 15:37.730

15:38.610 --> 15:41.490
This was before he was arrested as a suspect,

15:41.740 --> 15:43.990
so why would he have asked you this?

15:44.830 --> 15:45.909
Well...

15:46.700 --> 15:48.699
Because the victim being alive...

15:48.700 --> 15:50.908
would only cause more trouble for him.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.999
Could he have asked you this...

15:54.000 --> 15:55.418
because he was worried about her?

15:55.419 --> 15:56.629
Well...

15:57.549 --> 16:00.508
He didn't sound worried if you ask me.

16:00.509 --> 16:04.049
What about you then?

16:04.590 --> 16:07.139
Did you feel bad for the victim?

16:07.509 --> 16:08.519
Sorry?

16:10.429 --> 16:13.898
Oh, yes. Of course, I...

16:25.529 --> 16:26.529
It was 4am, right?

16:28.450 --> 16:31.080
The victim was 25 years of age.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.919
Hold on a second. How many times was she stabbed?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.840
I'm not sure. Probably 12 or 13.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.929
were you so sad and upset for the victim...

16:51.309 --> 16:54.190
that you matched the numbers on your lottery ticket?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600

In high school,

17:25.630 --> 17:27.009
the defendant...

17:27.430 --> 17:29.930
was advised to transfer schools.

17:31.809 --> 17:33.890
Could you elaborate on that?

Hyun Soo...

17:35.349 --> 17:36.349
(Witness)

17:36.350 --> 17:38.230
Well, he fought with a classmate...

17:39.269 --> 17:41.019
which led to a severe injury.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.490
Two of his classmate's teeth got broken.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.150
Physical altercation can happen between friends,

17:46.450 --> 17:48.950
so a transfer of schools seems like cruel punishment.

17:49.410 --> 17:50.740
Because it wasn't just a tussle.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.410
Hyun Soo...

17:54.700 --> 17:56.288
pushed him down the stairs.

18:00.460 --> 18:03.670
he pushed his classmate down the stairs.

18:06.509 --> 18:08.469
One can say that both parties are responsible.

18:08.470 --> 18:11.299
So why did the defendant have to transfer schools?

18:12.140 --> 18:13.890
The friend's teeth didn't break...

18:14.180 --> 18:15.680
before he tripped down the stairs.

18:16.809 --> 18:18.059
It was the other way around.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.599
What do you mean?

18:20.019 --> 18:21.819
He was pushed off the stairs first.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.730
And then Hyun Soo assaulted him...

18:25.900 --> 18:27.029
while he lay unconscious.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.329
This is important,

18:41.750 --> 18:43.089
so think long and hard...

18:43.589 --> 18:46.089
before you tell us what really happened.

18:50.759 --> 18:51.759
Well...

18:54.809 --> 18:59.479
(Defendant)

18:59.480 --> 19:03.150
My father partook in a strike...

19:04.230 --> 19:06.990
to increase the base taxi fare by 30 cents.

19:09.359 --> 19:12.200
The friend made snarky comments...

19:14.450 --> 19:17.329
about the fact that it was only 30 cents.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.750
From then on,

19:22.880 --> 19:26.509
everyone teased me endlessly by calling me 30 Cents.

19:30.049 --> 19:33.390
Why didn't you alert the school of the bullying?

19:34.930 --> 19:35.930
Well...

19:43.690 --> 19:44.769
I...

19:45.980 --> 19:47.440
couldn't.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.069
It would kill my father...

19:57.039 --> 19:59.000
to have known.

20:06.750 --> 20:07.750
Mr. Kim,

20:10.299 --> 20:11.930
do you regret...

20:12.880 --> 20:16.430
what happened in high school, and have you shown remorse?

20:19.019 --> 20:20.019
Yes.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.190
It was a lapse in judgement.

20:24.809 --> 20:25.980
I apologized...

20:26.819 --> 20:29.859
and also asked the friend for forgiveness.

20:30.690 --> 20:31.700
That's right.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.609
A lapse in judgement.

20:38.539 --> 20:39.539
Today...

20:40.329 --> 20:43.710
is my first day being first chair in a trial.

20:47.089 --> 20:49.460
And I also slipped up.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.549
Four years in college,

20:55.589 --> 20:57.140
three years in law school,

20:58.049 --> 21:00.930
and eight months of on-the-job training.

21:01.559 --> 21:04.599
Despite the dozens of mock trials I participated in,

21:05.400 --> 21:06.940
I made a mistake.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.440
However,

21:11.859 --> 21:14.240
isn't that the same for all of us?

21:15.609 --> 21:18.369
The police officer who didn't provide water at the DUI checkpoint.

21:18.529 --> 21:19.868
The officer who played his lottery ticket...

21:19.869 --> 21:21.160
with numbers from the crime scene.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.960
A son who physically assaulted another...

21:24.579 --> 21:26.500
outraged by the insults made toward his father.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.589
How can we say they are at fault?

21:32.049 --> 21:34.259
Today in court, the prosecution failed...

21:34.420 --> 21:37.258
to provide direct evidence linking my client to the murder.

21:37.259 --> 21:40.759
All she did was blindly question his moral conduct.

21:42.519 --> 21:45.059
"Is the woman dead?"

21:46.690 --> 21:50.268
Is it logical and reasonable to assume that this one question...

21:50.269 --> 21:53.190
is an admission of guilt?

21:56.910 --> 21:59.279
That I can answer with certainty.

22:02.490 --> 22:05.039
And my answer would be "no."

22:11.039 --> 22:12.170
I rest my case.

22:33.609 --> 22:36.319
Hyun Soo, do you remember this?

22:36.990 --> 22:40.160
It looked like you had eaten fruit in her bedroom.

22:41.869 --> 22:45.039
No, I don't recall eating the fruit.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.039
There must've been a knife here.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.339
Could it have been the knife you had?

22:55.759 --> 22:58.970
That knife was in the kitchen.

23:00.299 --> 23:01.339
What about the drugs?

23:02.009 --> 23:04.309
The drugs that Hong Guk Hwa gave you that night.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.180
Do you know where she got them?

23:09.440 --> 23:10.599
Here, look.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.730
This girl's name is Yoon Hyo Jung.

23:13.230 --> 23:15.229
She and Hong Guk Hwa lived together.

23:15.230 --> 23:16.690
Did she say anything about her?

23:18.319 --> 23:20.029
The house is big enough,

23:20.660 --> 23:23.029
so I let a friend stay with me.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.579
But I had her leave after a big falling-out last week.

23:29.539 --> 23:32.038
She did say she had a falling-out...

23:32.039 --> 23:33.960
with a friend who was staying with her.

23:34.420 --> 23:35.500
A falling-out?

23:36.049 --> 23:38.838
Yes. They had a falling-out, and she had cut all ties with her.

23:38.839 --> 23:39.930
I see.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.509
They had a falling-out.

23:52.519 --> 23:54.859
I'd say it's going very well so far.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.779
The jurors are starting to listen to you.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.190

24:51.960 --> 24:53.789
Ms. Yoon Hyo Jung.

24:54.619 --> 24:57.880
I heard you and Hong Guk Hwa had a big falling-out.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.839
And that's why you cut all ties with her, right?

Why did you and Hong Guk Hwa have a falling-out?

27:46.799 --> 27:49.509
She had cut all ties with you, so you two must've had a big fight.

27:50.180 --> 27:52.259
I don't know why I have to answer this question.

27:52.930 --> 27:54.259

27:56.220 --> 27:57.518
Did you get her the drugs?

27:57.519 --> 27:59.639
What are you talking about? It wasn't me.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.769
Then who was it?

28:02.599 --> 28:03.609
Who?

28:07.529 --> 28:10.650
I bet you either got her the drugs or did it with her.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.289
What about your toenails and fingernails?

I'm done talking to you.

28:38.390 --> 28:40.730
Did you kill Hong Guk Hwa?

28:42.730 --> 28:44.098
I told you. It wasn't me.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.899
Then you'd need an alibi.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.690
Why do I need an alibi when I'm not the killer?

28:49.069 --> 28:50.739
You lived together for two years...

28:50.740 --> 28:52.949
but had a falling-out and cut all ties just before the incident.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.950
Even if you weren't the person who got her the drugs,

28:55.490 --> 28:56.950
you used them with her.

28:57.279 --> 28:58.619
Look, Hyo Jung.

28:59.410 --> 29:02.039
If the police investigated this case properly,

29:02.500 --> 29:05.289
you'd be the prime suspect now. Do you realize that?

29:06.539 --> 29:09.130
You don't want the police to come after you, do you?

29:09.380 --> 29:10.670
You may get arrested.

29:12.259 --> 29:14.798
I moved out a week before Guk Hwa died.

29:14.799 --> 29:16.338
After that, I didn't call or visit her once...

29:16.339 --> 29:17.508
because I was so angry.

29:17.509 --> 29:20.930
Right. I find that very strange.

29:21.269 --> 29:23.139
I understand that you two had a falling-out,

29:23.140 --> 29:25.730
but your friend who you had lived with for two years died.

29:25.980 --> 29:27.979
Plus, your stuff is still there.

29:27.980 --> 29:29.940
And you haven't visited once? Why is that?

29:30.279 --> 29:33.279
If I were you, I would've visited at least once out of curiosity.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.609
I bet you intentionally...

29:36.069 --> 29:39.159
avoided visiting her because you felt guilty about something.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.739
It's got to be one of these two.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.450
Either you killed her,

29:44.210 --> 29:45.920
or you know who the killer is.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.509
Ace Orthopaedics Clinic.

29:54.670 --> 29:56.970
This therapist known as Bandage. You know him well, don't you?

29:58.849 --> 30:00.309
He was your minion.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.269
The Drug Squad caught him.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.440
And that has led me here.

30:15.319 --> 30:16.359
Kim Hyun Soo.

30:17.910 --> 30:18.990
You know him, right?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.368
I saw that he went to Ace Clinic for his dislocated shoulder...

30:22.369 --> 30:24.250
a few days ago.

30:26.539 --> 30:29.039
Tell me everything you know.

About what?

30:32.460 --> 30:33.549
Oh.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.509
Do you not know that you smuggled a drug into this place?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.639
You dislocated your shoulder, went to the clinic,

30:40.640 --> 30:42.009
and delivered the drug.

30:42.720 --> 30:43.970
Don't you remember?

30:53.819 --> 30:56.190
You went to Ace Clinic for your dislocated shoulder.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.609
And this man treated you.

31:01.319 --> 31:03.490
As you can see, this guy is the pitcher.

And you caught the ball.

31:07.910 --> 31:08.960
I just...

31:09.960 --> 31:12.089
went there to get my shoulder fixed. That's all.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.680
Tell me how you dislocated your shoulder.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.509
I'm really sorry,

31:22.259 --> 31:24.759
but how did I...

31:26.640 --> 31:27.849
deliver the drug?

31:35.400 --> 31:38.609
You're confusing me here.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.660
Are you totally clueless? Or are you just a good actor?

31:46.450 --> 31:49.369
The bandages that you had on your arm...

31:49.960 --> 31:51.710
had been soaked with a narcotized solution.

31:55.210 --> 31:57.960
You see, this isn't something we can just let go of.

32:01.970 --> 32:03.679
Gosh.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.059
Civil servants get paid peanuts and are always on the chopping block.

32:08.430 --> 32:10.769
I have to deal with this because the higher-ups want me to.

32:11.309 --> 32:14.440
But you know me. I hate dealing with a nuisance.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.150
So let's not make things difficult for both our sakes...

32:18.609 --> 32:19.779
and deal with this quietly.

32:21.990 --> 32:23.779
You know, give and take.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.539
I'm not here to get you, Hyun Soo.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.250
I'm here to catch the one who put you up to it,

32:30.960 --> 32:32.750
Do Ji Tae.

32:33.789 --> 32:35.539
With everything that's going on,

32:35.789 --> 32:38.089
there is no way you did it knowingly.

32:40.299 --> 32:41.799
But think about it.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.258
Let's say Do Ji Tae tells us everything.

32:44.259 --> 32:46.390
But if you keep your mouth shut,

32:47.259 --> 32:48.599
what do you think will happen?

32:50.099 --> 32:52.440
You'll take the fall for it.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.480
He'll stab you in the back.

33:00.740 --> 33:03.200
Your case is on trial at the moment.

33:03.859 --> 33:06.239
Giving the prosecution yet another thing to use against you...

33:06.240 --> 33:07.700
won't do you any good. Am I wrong?

33:18.920 --> 33:22.089
Those in prison are one of two kinds.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.470
Backstabbers or those who get back-stabbed.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.599
Being the former makes me invincible.

33:30.890 --> 33:32.599
My secret is to not trust people.

33:36.650 --> 33:37.859
You know that...

33:38.940 --> 33:41.359
I can have you transferred.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.950
Then you'll have to work your way to the top again.

33:46.069 --> 33:47.069
Are you good with that?

33:49.200 --> 33:52.410
Did you report to your superiors before bringing the party here?

33:54.410 --> 33:58.380
How many correctional officers do you think have been in this place?

34:01.549 --> 34:04.089
There have been seven wardens.

34:05.089 --> 34:06.470
Deputy chiefs, chiefs,

34:07.549 --> 34:11.219
and all those that rank higher than you.

34:13.099 --> 34:15.099
Do you think their hands are clean?

34:18.190 --> 34:19.860
Are you sure you can handle this?

34:21.480 --> 34:23.690
You piece of...

34:32.739 --> 34:34.289
You should get that.

34:38.670 --> 34:39.670
Yes, sir.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.460
Right.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.050
Sorry?

34:48.929 --> 34:49.929
But...

34:51.429 --> 34:52.429
I see.

34:55.059 --> 34:56.139
Yes, sir.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.780
It stinks from miles away.

35:12.030 --> 35:14.329
How high does the rotten food chain go up?

35:35.179 --> 35:36.179
I hate to tell you this,

35:38.019 --> 35:41.099
but I can't return without anything to show for myself.

35:44.980 --> 35:45.980
Let me at least have something.

36:13.849 --> 36:17.269
(Korean beef sirloin)

36:19.139 --> 36:20.768
That will be 113 dollars.

36:20.769 --> 36:22.769
You must pay extra if you wish to grill it here.

36:23.309 --> 36:25.190
I thought your specialty was drugs,

36:26.360 --> 36:28.360
but I see you're good with knives too, Mr. Um.

36:29.949 --> 36:30.949
Do I know you?

36:32.070 --> 36:34.780
What I want to know is this.

36:35.409 --> 36:36.409
Here.

36:37.369 --> 36:40.658
Why did Hong Guk Hwa call you that night,

36:40.659 --> 36:44.750
and where were you when the incident took place?

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Are you the police?

36:46.881 --> 36:48.549
When was the last time she bought from you?

36:48.550 --> 36:50.170
Buy what from me?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.880
I don't appreciate you jumping to conclusions.

36:54.340 --> 36:55.719
Right here.

36:56.510 --> 36:59.059
I bet you took her on as a client around the time...

36:59.349 --> 37:01.769
she was denied treatment for her alcoholism.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.150
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.900
You met her that night,

37:07.570 --> 37:08.899
but you didn't sell her drugs.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.570
Are you accusing me of killing her?

37:12.820 --> 37:14.530
You've got to be kidding me.

37:15.869 --> 37:18.489
Who was it though? Who gave up my name?

37:19.489 --> 37:20.909
You probably know who it was.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.860
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

37:57.659 --> 37:58.869
Goodness.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.199
(Interview)

38:02.869 --> 38:04.960
I forgot my phone.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.710
Good day then.

38:07.829 --> 38:09.500
Good luck with your business too.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.880
In here or out there,

38:12.510 --> 38:14.929
- it's the same old story. - Darn it.

38:15.679 --> 38:17.389
Money can buy you anything.

38:19.099 --> 38:21.139
You can buy anything you want...

38:21.469 --> 38:22.889
whether it's food or clothes.

38:24.099 --> 38:26.139
Correctional officers and inspectors alike.

38:27.230 --> 38:29.109
To earn a living is why they work.

38:29.110 --> 38:30.110
(Korea Post Bank Account, 100 dollars)

38:31.530 --> 38:33.530
You're more tight-lipped than I expected.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
What's this for?

38:46.501 --> 38:47.920
Call your father.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.170
I had his taxi delivered.

39:05.849 --> 39:07.018
Hello?

39:07.019 --> 39:10.150
Dad, it's me, Hyun Soo.

39:10.650 --> 39:11.650
Hyun Soo?

39:12.320 --> 39:13.570
How are you calling me?

39:13.940 --> 39:15.690
Isn't this a cell phone number?

39:15.739 --> 39:18.409
I happened to get my hands on one.

39:19.030 --> 39:22.530
Dad, did you perhaps get your taxi back?

39:23.369 --> 39:25.949
I just got it back, so how did you know that?

39:26.119 --> 39:28.250
Really? Did you really get it back?

39:28.539 --> 39:30.130
Yes, that's what I said.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.789
The call came out of nowhere...

39:33.300 --> 39:36.170
which was odd since they wouldn't listen when I begged.

39:38.050 --> 39:41.178
I see. Well, I'll call you again when I can.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.260
Hyun Soo?

39:49.440 --> 39:51.099
Thank you.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.030
It's yours now.

40:04.329 --> 40:06.158
You've got to be kidding me.

40:06.159 --> 40:09.119
Did you think I would let this slide?

40:10.329 --> 40:12.000
Darn wench.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.050
You were also going to see Guk Hwa that night, right?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.590
Don't you know that I can also go to the cops about you?

40:22.469 --> 40:25.349
Not this again. It's getting old.

40:26.969 --> 40:29.480
Like I said, I didn't sleep with her.

40:29.809 --> 40:33.059
- You darn cow. - Careful. It's hot.

40:33.690 --> 40:35.769
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

40:38.940 --> 40:39.988
It's too bad...

40:39.989 --> 40:42.408
since only a consented recording is admissible.

40:42.409 --> 40:44.989
From here, we'll find something we can use.

40:45.829 --> 40:48.618
Guk Hwa had a falling-out with her roommate...

40:48.619 --> 40:49.908
a week before the incident and had cut all ties,

40:49.909 --> 40:51.828
and Um Ki Jong was her drug dealer.

40:51.829 --> 40:54.539
The three were in a love triangle,

40:55.920 --> 40:58.340
and the two of them have no alibi.

40:58.670 --> 41:00.800
Anyone can tell that this is fishy.

41:02.219 --> 41:04.089
I'll have them requested as witnesses...

41:04.090 --> 41:05.929
and see to it that the subpoenas are delivered.

41:06.510 --> 41:09.638
Do you have the CCTV footage from the day of the crime?

41:09.639 --> 41:10.639
Oh, yes.

41:13.650 --> 41:15.649
I secured all the CCTV footage...

41:15.650 --> 41:17.690
that was on Hyun Soo's route that night.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.940
However, there are a lot.

41:22.239 --> 41:23.449
Are you going to watch them all?

41:30.119 --> 41:31.250
I have to.

43:09.090 --> 43:10.219
What?

43:13.769 --> 43:14.769
I see.

43:16.730 --> 43:24.730
(Gas Station, LPG)

43:44.380 --> 43:46.420
Oh, Lee Chul Ho?

43:47.760 --> 43:50.219
I'm afraid he quit last month though.

43:50.429 --> 43:51.799
Why? Is there an issue?

43:51.800 --> 43:53.469
Yes, with the delivery of ours.

43:53.809 --> 43:55.059
I'd like for him to confirm something.

43:55.389 --> 43:57.678
Can I have the name and address?

43:57.679 --> 43:59.349
The name is Hong Guk Hwa.

44:00.150 --> 44:02.058
The address is 68 Chusa-ro, Chungang-Gu.

44:02.059 --> 44:05.280
Let's see if I can find 68 Chusa-ro.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.989
Ms. Hong Guk Hwa. Just a second.

44:08.610 --> 44:10.610
Let's see.

44:11.070 --> 44:13.579
A package was delivered last month.

44:14.159 --> 44:15.539
Is there an issue with it?

44:17.119 --> 44:19.079
A few disappeared en route.

44:19.250 --> 44:20.709
Darn.

44:20.710 --> 44:22.329
That jerk...

44:22.960 --> 44:26.710
By the way, why did he quit?

44:28.090 --> 44:30.219
Well...

44:30.760 --> 44:32.889
Actually, he didn't quit. He was let go...

44:33.429 --> 44:36.099
because he hid the fact that he was wearing an electronic anklet.

44:36.639 --> 44:39.639
It's illegal for a delivery business to hire sex offenders.

44:40.559 --> 44:42.940
Oh, he had an ankle monitor?

44:50.150 --> 44:56.199
(Yumin Ironworks)

45:00.079 --> 45:02.460
- Thank you! - Thank you.

45:25.650 --> 45:27.980
Darn, you stupid dog.

45:28.280 --> 45:29.480
Gosh.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.449
Goodness.

45:41.369 --> 45:42.500
Hello?

45:44.789 --> 45:45.829
Anybody here?

45:48.710 --> 45:49.800
Hello?

45:51.510 --> 45:53.679
Anybody here?

45:57.139 --> 45:58.219
Hello?

46:01.730 --> 46:03.139
- Who are you? - My gosh!

46:09.860 --> 46:11.230
Evidence 109.

46:15.909 --> 46:18.239
As soon as the defendant got into the stolen taxi...

46:19.239 --> 46:20.619
Darn it.

46:24.079 --> 46:25.710
He turned off the dashcam,

46:26.210 --> 46:27.420
which was intentional.

46:28.670 --> 46:30.340
Evidence 113.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.550
CCTV footage from the scene, at 8:41pm.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.760
He chose his victim.

46:39.469 --> 46:40.929
He was hunting for his victim.

46:49.269 --> 46:51.939
Is there another reason...

46:51.940 --> 46:54.780
why you believe that the murder was deliberate and premeditated?

46:55.070 --> 46:56.780
What he did after the incident...

46:57.280 --> 47:00.949
matches the patterns that sly, manipulative murderers exhibit.

47:02.699 --> 47:05.250
He did not report the incident.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.999
(Defendant)

47:07.000 --> 47:08.380
He did not call the police...

47:08.630 --> 47:10.750
and didn't even tell his parents or friends about it.

47:11.420 --> 47:14.460
He didn't tell anyone until the moment he was arrested.

47:15.130 --> 47:16.880
And that day,

47:17.380 --> 47:19.719
he had at least three opportunities to turn himself in.

47:20.469 --> 47:22.139
As soon as he found the body,

47:22.559 --> 47:24.309
when he was stopped at the DUI checkpoint,

47:24.559 --> 47:26.099
and when he came to the police station.

47:26.389 --> 47:29.349
However, he did not say anything...

47:29.599 --> 47:31.440
about the incident.

47:33.730 --> 47:36.739
He attempted to destroy evidence at the scene and fled.

47:37.150 --> 47:40.119
And he had the murder weapon on him until the moment he was arrested...

47:40.949 --> 47:42.949
but showed no remorse whatsoever.

47:44.829 --> 47:45.949
No.

47:47.369 --> 47:48.460
Mr. Kim.

47:49.039 --> 47:50.750
That is not true.

47:59.340 --> 48:01.179
I did not kill her,

48:02.300 --> 48:03.678
so why should I feel remorse?

48:03.679 --> 48:05.558
The prosecutor is examining the witness.

48:05.559 --> 48:07.768
Doing this can put you at a disadvantage.

48:07.769 --> 48:09.599
No one believes me!

48:11.059 --> 48:12.940
I've been telling the truth all along.

48:13.980 --> 48:15.780
Why won't you listen to me?

48:17.239 --> 48:19.030
If I don't speak out like this,

48:19.489 --> 48:21.570
everyone will believe what the detective is saying.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.869
What I'm telling you is the truth,

48:25.949 --> 48:28.328
whereas that's just what he is claiming.

48:28.329 --> 48:31.880
Are you insisting that the witness is lying now?

48:32.420 --> 48:35.839
I did not kill her. It really wasn't me.

48:35.840 --> 48:39.510
I did not kill Hong Guk Hwa.

48:40.130 --> 48:41.760
I'm not a murderer.

48:43.139 --> 48:46.010
Mr. Kim, please calm down.

48:50.139 --> 48:53.309
That's the kind of behaviour I'm talking about.

48:57.530 --> 49:00.199
A murderer's violent nature.

49:02.909 --> 49:03.989
Mr. Kim.

49:06.789 --> 49:07.869
If you'd like,

49:09.159 --> 49:12.119
you can give evidence now.

49:13.329 --> 49:14.539
It's simple.

49:15.340 --> 49:18.130
All you have to do is be on the witness stand.

49:23.429 --> 49:25.599
Mr. Kim, you're very upset right now.

49:26.050 --> 49:27.718
If you get up on the witness stand now,

49:27.719 --> 49:30.098
and if something unexpected happens...

49:30.099 --> 49:31.429
I'll do it.

49:34.900 --> 49:36.440
I will get up on the witness stand.

49:36.769 --> 49:37.819
You made a wise decision.

49:37.820 --> 49:39.900
Your Honour. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

49:40.150 --> 49:41.779
As per Mr. Kim's request,

49:41.780 --> 49:44.409
I would like to bring him in as a witness.

50:03.130 --> 50:06.010
- Shall I pour you a glass too? - I'm good. I gave up drinking.

50:08.969 --> 50:11.179
Not much happened that day.

50:12.230 --> 50:14.639
Although that rude girl threw her cigarette butt at me.

50:15.940 --> 50:17.809
Other than that, nothing happened.

50:19.690 --> 50:21.738
You started chasing the taxi as soon as it drove off.

50:21.739 --> 50:23.110
No, I wasn't chasing it.

50:23.949 --> 50:26.489
I had to take off too because I had somewhere to go.

50:26.989 --> 50:28.409
Where did you have to go?

50:32.699 --> 50:34.619
Why do you want to know that?

50:35.710 --> 50:36.789
Well...

50:38.170 --> 50:40.000
I noticed...

50:40.500 --> 50:42.840
that you have been to Hong Guk Hwa's place in the past.

50:44.929 --> 50:47.760
That's nothing odd because I used to work as a courier.

50:49.179 --> 50:51.219
What's the problem?

50:51.769 --> 50:53.599
You knew Hong Guk Hwa,

50:54.940 --> 50:57.149
and you followed her that night.

50:57.150 --> 51:00.730
Anyone would think that it's suspicious.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.280
Let me just say this one thing to you.

51:06.699 --> 51:08.280
I had nothing to do with it.

51:09.989 --> 51:12.039
If I had anything to do with it,

51:12.449 --> 51:14.079
the police would be here,

51:14.869 --> 51:16.119
not a lawyer.

51:16.369 --> 51:19.210
Breaking and entering and rape.

51:19.630 --> 51:21.340
An ex-con with the exact same priors...

51:22.050 --> 51:23.759
followed the victim...

51:23.760 --> 51:25.549
all the way to the Han River on the day of the incident.

51:25.550 --> 51:27.300
Do you not think it's suspicious?

51:43.530 --> 51:44.860
By the way,

51:47.449 --> 51:48.659
did you come here alone?

51:50.739 --> 51:51.989
What if I did?

51:53.199 --> 51:54.489
Do you want to fight me?

51:58.079 --> 51:59.369
Mr. Kim.

52:00.460 --> 52:02.420
Would you say you're honest?

52:05.300 --> 52:06.300
Pardon?

52:07.760 --> 52:09.969
Do you think you're an honest person?

52:15.219 --> 52:16.980
I think I am.

52:19.019 --> 52:21.099
Shall I give you a chance to change your answer?

52:23.190 --> 52:24.230
No.

52:25.610 --> 52:26.690
Okay.

52:27.110 --> 52:28.780
You said you were honest,

52:29.320 --> 52:31.239
so I expect you to answer my questions honestly.

52:33.119 --> 52:34.369
On the day of the incident,

52:34.699 --> 52:36.949
did you get your father's permission...

52:37.829 --> 52:39.289
before leaving home in his taxi?

52:41.960 --> 52:43.000
No.

52:43.539 --> 52:45.130
You don't have a license to drive a taxi, do you?

52:46.300 --> 52:48.340
- I don't. - So that's illegal.

52:52.510 --> 52:53.510
Right.

52:54.349 --> 52:56.809
Why did you tilt your head like that just now?

53:01.139 --> 53:02.190
I'm just not sure...

53:03.440 --> 53:06.779
if this is an important matter in this situation.

53:06.780 --> 53:08.239
Because of your illegal act,

53:08.570 --> 53:10.488
your father may lose his taxi license.

53:10.489 --> 53:13.780
Is that not important to you?

53:15.659 --> 53:17.449
I didn't think of that.

53:17.949 --> 53:20.909
Do you enjoy endangering the lives of others?

53:22.869 --> 53:24.420
No, I do not.

53:24.840 --> 53:27.959
If that is the case, then why...

53:27.960 --> 53:29.590
(Evidence 1)

53:30.219 --> 53:31.969
Then why did you take illegal drugs...

53:32.090 --> 53:36.009
and drive the taxi when your blood alcohol level was 0.12,

53:36.010 --> 53:37.429
which is enough to get your license revoked?

53:41.230 --> 53:43.150
Why did you pick her up?

53:43.650 --> 53:45.519
(Jury)

53:46.150 --> 53:47.769
She just got in the car.

53:48.650 --> 53:50.738
I said the taxi was off duty and told her to get out but...

53:50.739 --> 53:52.610
If you pull over with your for-hire light on,

53:52.949 --> 53:55.449
the passenger would get in the car, of course.

53:58.409 --> 54:01.159
Let's say the passenger was someone else.

54:01.789 --> 54:02.959
If it was a guy,

54:02.960 --> 54:05.460
would you still have gone to the park by the river with him?

54:09.590 --> 54:11.380
- No. - In other words,

54:12.469 --> 54:14.719
you went there with her because it was her.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.049
Hoping to get her into bed.

54:18.050 --> 54:20.518
No, I never thought that.

54:20.519 --> 54:22.519
You say that, but your actions say otherwise.

54:22.730 --> 54:25.349
You did sleep with her a few hours later.

54:30.030 --> 54:31.569
The thought of...

54:31.570 --> 54:33.448
sleeping with an attractive woman whom you had just met...

54:33.449 --> 54:34.949
must've gotten you very excited.

54:35.739 --> 54:38.119
You had been drinking on top of the drugs,

54:39.079 --> 54:40.539
so you couldn't think straight.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
She said she didn't want it,

54:45.539 --> 54:48.500
but you just went ahead and did it.

54:49.880 --> 54:52.550
No, that is not what happened.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.550
- We were attracted to each other... - No.

54:55.679 --> 54:58.679
A woman who lived alone invited you over to her place...

54:58.760 --> 55:01.010
and even gave you drugs, so I bet you thought she was easy.

55:01.219 --> 55:03.389
You had been drinking, so you couldn't resist the urge.

55:03.769 --> 55:04.849
Mr. Kim.

55:05.639 --> 55:07.269
Can you deny that?

55:07.900 --> 55:09.820
(Judge)

55:19.829 --> 55:21.658
(Supreme Court of Korea)

55:21.659 --> 55:23.500
Ms. Hong trusted you.

55:24.619 --> 55:26.579
It is why she went out with you,

55:26.920 --> 55:28.250
invited you into her home,

55:28.920 --> 55:30.380
and had drinks with you.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
However, you had other ideas.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.760
You...

55:35.260 --> 55:39.090
only saw her as someone who could satisfy your sexual needs.

55:39.340 --> 55:40.679
This difference in thought.

55:41.510 --> 55:43.969
This one lapse of judgement on Ms. Hong's part...

55:44.639 --> 55:46.230
led to her death.

55:52.110 --> 55:55.110
Hong Guk Hwa. You killed her, didn't you?

55:56.820 --> 55:58.030
It wasn't me.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.449
Whatever. It doesn't change the fact...

56:00.619 --> 56:02.738
that you'll have to sit in court...

56:02.739 --> 56:05.250
and provide an alibi for the time of death.

56:06.619 --> 56:07.619
Hey.

56:08.079 --> 56:09.079
I said it wasn't me.

56:17.170 --> 56:19.340
How did you feel after you slept with her?

56:26.559 --> 56:27.559
I don't know.

56:30.150 --> 56:32.360
How do you feel after such activities?

56:32.690 --> 56:33.769
Defendant!

56:34.860 --> 56:35.939
Please refrain yourself.

56:35.940 --> 56:38.149
Then put yourself in my shoes.

56:38.150 --> 56:40.698
I'm here speaking the truth,

56:40.699 --> 56:42.988
but instead of listening, she's asking useless questions.

56:42.989 --> 56:45.789
Why didn't you speak the truth at the police station?

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
During your interrogation,

56:49.501 --> 56:51.880
you repeated "I don't know" 157 times.

56:56.090 --> 56:57.090
Well, that...

57:01.130 --> 57:03.388
That's what my attorney advised me to do.

57:03.389 --> 57:06.809
No, you yelled that you couldn't remember,

57:07.179 --> 57:08.678
but to questions that weren't in your favour,

57:08.679 --> 57:11.309
you said that you didn't know.

57:15.269 --> 57:17.189
You don't speak about Ms. Hong's death either.

57:17.190 --> 57:19.400
Why is that? Well, it's simple.

57:21.199 --> 57:22.239
It's because...

57:23.280 --> 57:24.320
you...

57:26.119 --> 57:27.288
killed her.

57:27.289 --> 57:31.539
No. How many times must I say that it wasn't me!

57:31.710 --> 57:33.788
After you found her body,

57:33.789 --> 57:35.419
you stated...

57:35.420 --> 57:37.550
that you fled the scene because you were flustered.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.709
The horrific scene that you saw made you panic.

57:39.710 --> 57:40.719
Is that right?

57:44.429 --> 57:46.759
- Yes. - But actually, you went back there.

57:46.760 --> 57:47.849
You returned to her house,

57:48.429 --> 57:50.309
grabbed your jacket with your car key inside,

57:50.599 --> 57:51.638
got rid of the evidence,

57:51.639 --> 57:53.149
took the knife which is the murder weapon,

57:53.150 --> 57:55.059
and fled the scene for the second time.

57:55.860 --> 57:56.860
Come on.

57:57.690 --> 58:00.900
How can someone in a panic accomplish such activities?

58:06.369 --> 58:08.948
I know... I know how this may look.

58:08.949 --> 58:09.949
That's right.

58:11.199 --> 58:12.789
It looks like...

58:13.579 --> 58:16.289
a cold-blooded killer tried to clean up after him.

58:19.960 --> 58:21.419
In the squad car that night,

58:21.420 --> 58:24.090
why did you ask if the woman was dead?

58:25.010 --> 58:26.010
That's...

58:27.429 --> 58:29.889
That was because I wanted...

58:31.599 --> 58:34.638
to be wrong about her being dead.

58:34.639 --> 58:36.860
Didn't it occur to you that you should call an ambulance?

58:40.980 --> 58:41.988
No.

58:41.989 --> 58:43.070
Why not?

58:47.989 --> 58:51.368
Because... Because I was scared.

58:51.369 --> 58:52.750
What were you scared of?

58:57.920 --> 59:01.090
The police thinking that I did this to her.

59:01.380 --> 59:04.590
So rather than trying to help a bleeding woman,

59:05.840 --> 59:08.429
you were more worried...

59:09.139 --> 59:10.849
about being mistaken as the killer.

59:11.260 --> 59:12.598
Even when it's the woman...

59:12.599 --> 59:14.849
you made love to that night.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.400
- I guess it can seem that way. - It does.

59:21.860 --> 59:24.489
You fled the scene without trying to help her.

59:28.489 --> 59:30.489
How did you feel when you first...

59:31.239 --> 59:32.539
found her?

59:40.340 --> 59:41.669
I don't know.

59:41.670 --> 59:43.630
How did you feel when you ran away?

59:50.849 --> 59:52.349
Just like now,

59:53.719 --> 59:57.019
you choose not to answer questions that aren't in your favour.

59:57.099 --> 59:58.730
Was this also your counsel's advice?

1:00:05.070 --> 1:00:07.110
Do you know what I can't understand about you?

1:00:09.199 --> 1:00:12.079
From the very beginning,

1:00:12.619 --> 1:00:14.369
you've been claiming your innocence,

1:00:14.869 --> 1:00:16.579
but that night,

1:00:17.119 --> 1:00:19.539
you fled the scene for selfish reasons.

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.839
But then you returned...

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:24.130
to eliminate and contaminate incriminating evidence...

1:00:24.550 --> 1:00:27.379
and drove under the influence...

1:00:27.380 --> 1:00:29.469
just to flee the scene once again.

1:00:30.590 --> 1:00:32.349
What if you called for an ambulance...

1:00:36.519 --> 1:00:38.059
and the victim...

1:00:40.019 --> 1:00:42.730
received medical treatment?

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.650
She might still be alive right now.

1:00:48.989 --> 1:00:53.829
(Supreme Court of Korea)

1:00:54.530 --> 1:00:55.539
That night,

1:00:56.750 --> 1:00:58.369
there was a sliver of hope.

1:00:59.750 --> 1:01:01.829
There was a tiny window of opportunity,

1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:06.209
but you wasted it by trying to only save yourself.

1:01:06.210 --> 1:01:08.630
You turned a blind eye to Ms. Hong who was bleeding out.

1:01:09.010 --> 1:01:10.010
So considering all that,

1:01:11.300 --> 1:01:12.800
can it be said...

1:01:14.849 --> 1:01:16.889
that you are innocent?

1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:31.570
Mr. Kim, you believe yourself to be honest,

1:01:32.030 --> 1:01:33.489
so I'll ask you one last time.

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:36.789
Mr. Kim.

1:01:47.130 --> 1:01:48.130
That night.

1:01:50.969 --> 1:01:53.510
Did you...

1:01:55.260 --> 1:01:56.260
kill...

1:01:58.769 --> 1:02:00.230
Ms. Hong Guk Hwa?

1:02:12.150 --> 1:02:13.449
Mr. Kim?

1:02:15.239 --> 1:02:16.579
I...

1:02:18.409 --> 1:02:20.119
I...

1:02:22.289 --> 1:02:23.579
I don't know.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.840
I don't know anymore.
