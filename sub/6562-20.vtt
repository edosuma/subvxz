09:04.933 --> 09:06.900
- NO.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.900
- LOVELY WEDDING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:08.900 --> 09:12.100
- I PROMISED MYSELF
I WOULDN'T CRY...

09:12.100 --> 09:13.367
[sniffling]

09:13.367 --> 09:15.133
BUT NOW I'M GONNA BE WATCHING
LIKE A HAWK

09:15.133 --> 09:17.700
TO PROVE THIS MARRIAGE
IS A SCAM.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.733
OOH!
CONGA LINE!

09:26.067 --> 09:27.700
- [panting]

09:27.700 --> 09:30.067
WE GOT HERE
AS QUICK AS I COULD.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.067
- WHO'S THAT?

09:31.067 --> 09:33.433
- MILLICENT CRANE.
STATE DEPARTMENT.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.100
- SHE'S GONNA HELP US
GET JAMES BACK.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.267
- GREAT.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.433
- BUT WE HAVE TO HANDLE THIS
DIPLOMATICALLY.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.600
KUPLANKISTAN
HAS A NATURAL RESOURCE

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.067
- MM, OIL.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.667
- MUSTACHE DYE.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.400
NOW, SOMEBODY CALL JAMES

09:47.400 --> 09:48.900
AND TELL HIM NOT TO PANIC

09:48.900 --> 09:51.733
AND TO STAY PUT.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.100
- IT'S RINGING.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.333
- HELLO?
- JAMES, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:55.333 --> 09:56.533
- YEP.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.467
- LISTEN, WE HAVE
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HERE,

09:58.467 --> 10:00.767
AND WE ARE GONNA GET YOU
UNENGAGED.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.033
- WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT
TRY TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

10:04.033 --> 10:05.500
- TOO LATE!

10:05.500 --> 10:08.733
[men shouting]

10:08.733 --> 10:11.867
[peppy horn music]

10:11.867 --> 10:13.700
- OKAY, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

10:13.700 --> 10:14.933
- TWO POSSIBILITIES:

10:14.933 --> 10:17.200
ONE, JAMES COULD OUTRUN
THE GUARDS,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.967
SO WE COULD HIDE HIM
IN AN ALASKAN CANNERY

10:18.967 --> 10:20.533
UNTIL THE KING
GIVES UP INTEREST,

10:20.533 --> 10:22.833
OR TWO,

10:22.833 --> 10:24.267
THE GUARDS ARE FASTER THAN HIM,

10:24.267 --> 10:26.567
THEN THE KING LOCKS HIM
IN A TOWER.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.933
- HE LOCKED ME IN THE TOWER!

10:29.933 --> 10:30.933
- [gasps]

10:30.933 --> 10:32.600
- HELP!

10:37.267 --> 10:38.500
- [wailing]

10:38.500 --> 10:39.700
- JAMES!

10:39.700 --> 10:41.100
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES

10:41.100 --> 10:43.967
AND JUMP DOWN
ONTO THIS SAFETY NET!

10:43.967 --> 10:45.133
- HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'LL CATCH ME?

10:45.133 --> 10:47.000
- JUST THROW
SOMETHING ELSE DOWN.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.233
WE'LL SHOW YOU
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.300
- OOH.

10:53.367 --> 10:56.200
- PERFECT!
TOSS IT DOWN!

10:58.933 --> 11:00.067
splat!

11:01.967 --> 11:04.100
- OKAY.
NOW YOU.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.267
- [shrieks]

11:09.300 --> 11:11.600
- [clears throat]

11:11.600 --> 11:13.300
- HEY, WIFEY.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.633
HOW ABOUT SOME LUNCH?

11:14.633 --> 11:17.867
- OH, NO.
I AM NOT MAKING YOU LUNCH.

11:17.867 --> 11:20.133
- OF COURSE NOT.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.100
I MADE LUNCH FOR YOU.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.267
NOW, WOULD YOU PREFER
A LIGHT MISWA SALAD?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.667
OR YOU COULD LIVE A LITTLE

11:26.667 --> 11:27.900
AND HAVE A KOBE BEEF BURGER

11:27.900 --> 11:31.767
WITH ORGANIC HOMEMADE BON FITTE.

11:31.767 --> 11:32.833
- MOM, GO BURGER.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.833
IT'S AMAZING.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.100
- YOU...MADE ALL THIS?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.400
- YEAH, I ALSO
FIXED YOUR HAIR DRYER,

11:39.400 --> 11:40.933
I REPLACED THESE LIGHT BULBS,

11:40.933 --> 11:44.367
AND CHANGED THE OIL
IN YOUR CAR.

11:44.367 --> 11:46.167
US POOPSALOTS
LIKE TO KEEP BUSY.

11:46.167 --> 11:49.767
HERE YOU ARE, MADAM.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.767
- AHA!

11:51.767 --> 11:54.733
HOW'S THE HAPPY COUPLE?

11:54.733 --> 11:56.633
- GREAT.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.867
- OH, REALLY?

11:57.867 --> 12:01.167
THEN WHERE'S THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE?

12:01.167 --> 12:02.933
- MAKING BROWNIES.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.733
- HE MAKES BROWNIES?

12:04.733 --> 12:05.733
- OKAY.

12:05.733 --> 12:08.400
THINGS DO SEEM TO BE GOING FINE.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.067
BUT I'LL BE BACK...

12:10.067 --> 12:11.300
LATER.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.367
[book snaps]

12:17.167 --> 12:18.167
- AWESOME!

12:18.167 --> 12:20.300
WE TOTALLY ACED THAT.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.833
- AND I AM OFF
TO THE GAME ROOM TO CELEBRATE.

12:22.833 --> 12:23.867
- UH-UH-UH-UH.

12:23.867 --> 12:24.900
NOT UNTIL YOU'VE PRACTICED

12:24.900 --> 12:26.467
YOUR VIOLIN, YOUNG LADY.

12:26.467 --> 12:27.700
- DUDE, HE'S GONE.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.667
YOU CAN CUT THE ACT.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.433
- WHAT ACT?
START PRACTICING.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.567
- PLAY ME SOMETHING NICE.

12:34.567 --> 12:37.500
[harsh violin sounds]

12:39.067 --> 12:41.933
- OKAY, SINCE WE CAN'T
GET JAMES OUT OF THE TOWER,

12:41.933 --> 12:43.067
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE NO ONE

12:43.067 --> 12:44.267
WHO CAN MARRY HIM
AND THE PRINCESS

12:44.267 --> 12:45.267
GETS IN.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.433
- STILL, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY

12:46.433 --> 12:48.867
TO GET MORE DIRT
ON THIS WEDDING.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.833
- OH!
DIRT BOY!

12:50.833 --> 12:52.433
YOU HAVE TO HELP US.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.267
PLEASE TELL US
THE ROYAL WEDDING PLANS

12:54.267 --> 12:56.333
SO WE CAN STOP IT
AND SAVE OUR FRIEND.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.367
- PLEASE?

12:57.367 --> 12:59.100
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO STOP IT?

12:59.100 --> 13:01.533
YOUR FRIEND IS THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.

13:01.533 --> 13:03.900
THE PRINCESS IS BEAUTIFUL
OF FACE

13:03.900 --> 13:05.333
AND PURE OF HEART

13:05.333 --> 13:07.700
AND OWNS MANY, MANY GOATS.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.467
- YEAH, SHE'S HOT
AND SHE HAS GOATS.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.867
WHEN IS THE WEDDING?

13:11.867 --> 13:14.667
- AFTER CEREMONY OF SECRETS
IN PARK...

13:14.667 --> 13:16.667
WHICH IS NOW!

13:16.667 --> 13:19.667
[hypnotic Middle Eastern music]

13:19.667 --> 13:25.400

13:29.433 --> 13:30.867
HELP ME!

13:30.867 --> 13:32.200

13:32.200 --> 13:35.067
MEET US IN THE PARK!

13:35.067 --> 13:37.933
- NOW, THIS IS A STANDARD
IMMIGRATION TEST

13:37.933 --> 13:40.800
TO DETERMINE WHO WELL
A COUPLE KNOWS EACH OTHER...

13:40.800 --> 13:42.433
OR DOESN'T.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.833
AH...AWKWARD HAND-HOLDING.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.367
NOW, QUESTION NUMBER ONE:

13:53.367 --> 13:56.367
DESCRIBE YOUR FIRST DATE,
IN DETAIL.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.533
- IT WAS AT THE ZOO.
- AT THE FROZEN YOGURT STORE.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.067
- IT WAS THE FROZEN YOGURT STAND
AT THE ZOO.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.300
- THE SUN DANCED
OFF JENNIFER'S EYES

14:04.300 --> 14:06.200
AS WE FED EACH OTHER FROGURT,

14:06.200 --> 14:09.600
LULLED BY THE JOYOUS SONGS
OF THE TOUCANS.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.100
R-R-RILL.
REGH-URGH-R-RILL.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.833
THEN, WE STROLLED
THROUGH THE GARDEN

14:13.833 --> 14:15.867
AND SHARED OUR HOPES AND DREAMS.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.100
- THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

14:18.100 --> 14:20.133
- AS IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.600
WE WENT TO THE BEACH,

14:21.600 --> 14:23.733
PUT OUR FEET
IN THE COOL, COOL SAND,

14:23.733 --> 14:27.300
AND WE WATCHED THE MOST
SPECTACULAR SUNSET OF OUR LIVES.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.133
- OH...

14:29.133 --> 14:30.333
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

14:30.333 --> 14:32.167
I'M REDOING MY WIFE'S BATHROOM

14:32.167 --> 14:34.600
SO THAT SHE HAS
THE SANCTUARY SHE DESERVES.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.667
- [gasps]

14:35.667 --> 14:40.267
- DARLING, WHICH TILE
DO YOU PREFER?

14:40.267 --> 14:41.600
- THAT ONE.

14:46.867 --> 14:52.267
- UH, WELL, I'LL BE NOTIFYING
MY SUPERVISOR OF MY FINDINGS.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.567
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
OUR DECISION.

14:57.467 --> 14:58.700
- DID YOU GUYS MESS UP?

14:58.700 --> 15:00.400
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING,

15:00.400 --> 15:01.767
I HATE THE VIOLIN,

15:01.767 --> 15:04.200
AND MAYBE BUDDHA BOB
WILL LOVE IT BACK IN CANADA.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.333
- I DON'T HEAR PRACTICING.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.333
- [groans]

15:08.333 --> 15:09.967
[harsh violin sounds]

15:12.100 --> 15:13.533
- THE CEREMONY OF SECRETS

15:13.533 --> 15:15.867
IS WHERE YOU BUILD MUCH TRUST

15:15.867 --> 15:18.167
BY TELLING EACH OTHER A SECRET

15:18.167 --> 15:19.633
THAT IS SO DEEP

15:19.633 --> 15:21.700
THAT ONLY THE TWO OF YOU KNOW IT

15:21.700 --> 15:23.733
AND TAKE IT TO YOUR GRAVE.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.567
[timer clicks]

15:29.800 --> 15:31.867
- OKAY, WELL,
HERE'S A SECRET FOR YOU.

15:31.867 --> 15:34.333
[whispering]
I DON'T WANT TO MARRY YOU.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.167
MAYBE IT'S MY AGE
OR THE GUYS WITH THE KNIVES,

15:36.167 --> 15:37.833
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
THE COSTUME I'M WEARING!

15:37.833 --> 15:39.367
BUT JUST NOT FEELING IT.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.600
- JAMES, I DON'T WANT
TO MARRY YOU, EITHER.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.867
- WHAT?
WAIT, WHY?

15:42.867 --> 15:44.867
'CAUSE SERIOUSLY, I'M A CATCH.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.800
- MY HEART BELONGS TO ANOTHER.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.067
- DIRT BOY?

15:50.067 --> 15:52.933
- HE HAS BEEN BY MY SIDE
ALL MY LIFE,

15:52.933 --> 15:56.900
AND UNDERNEATH THAT
FILTHY, DUSTY EXTERIOR,

15:56.900 --> 15:58.700
HE'S MY ONE TRUE LOVE.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.200
[timer dings]
- OKAY.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.867
CEREMONY OF SECRETS IS OVER.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.067
NOW WE'RE GOING TO AIRPORT

16:03.067 --> 16:05.333

LET'S GO TOMORROW.

STATE DEPARTMENT.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.567
I'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS CASE,

17:21.567 --> 17:24.067
AND YOU CAN'T FORCE JAMES
TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.067
- NOPE.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.167
- YOU MEAN I CAN'T GET DAUGHTER

17:26.167 --> 17:27.667
TO MARRY HANDSOME POP STAR?

17:27.667 --> 17:29.467

- WELL, IF YOU HELD THE WEDDING

17:31.300 --> 17:34.333
AT THE KUPLANKISTANI EMBASSY
WHERE OUR LAWS DON'T APPLY,

17:34.333 --> 17:35.633
YOU COULD.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.667
- WELL, THEN, LET'S HAVE WEDDING
