WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.703
Well, you're right, Maw Maw.

00:02.736 --> 00:06.074
The old gray mare--
she ain't what she used to be.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.209
You're not gonna believe
what I just saw.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.243
I just watched
an 86-year-old woman

00:09.277 --> 00:11.045
give herself
a Brazilian wax.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.480
Try me.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.049
I'm mowing the Andersons' yard
and I hear this commotion.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.085
I look over the bushes,
into the park,

00:17.118 --> 00:20.721
and I saw him forcing
his way on top of her.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.356
Oh, my God, Burt.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.358
It was horrible; she was
fighting to get away.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.259
What did you do?

00:25.293 --> 00:26.360
I shouted, "Get off of her!"

00:26.394 --> 00:28.529
He looked up at me with
that caught look in his eye.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.264
He took off running.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.365
Was she okay?

00:31.399 --> 00:34.235
I don't know. She scurried
up a tree and was gone.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.172
Burt... are we talking
about a human?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.307
Squirrel.
Damn it,

00:39.340 --> 00:41.842
Burt, if you're going to come
home with these stories,

00:41.875 --> 00:43.344
you have to lead
with the species,

00:43.377 --> 00:44.578
so I know
if I should care or not.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.580
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.848
You're not on
the front lines

00:47.881 --> 00:49.550
of Mother Nature's
twisted playground.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.719
I'm faced with
squirrel rapists,

00:51.752 --> 00:54.388
birds ripping innocent
worms from their homes,

00:54.422 --> 00:56.790
and I saw that whole
family get electrocuted.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.127
They were moths.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.428
I bet you'd be crying
your eyes out

01:00.461 --> 01:02.730
if it was a family
of butterflies.

01:02.763 --> 01:06.134
A moth is just
an ugly butterfly, Virginia.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.501
Racist.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.404
Whoo!

01:10.438 --> 01:12.140
* Here we go

01:12.173 --> 01:15.443
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:18.179 --> 01:20.314
(in low voice): Do not get
out of that bed, Hope.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.116
You hear how low my voice is?

01:22.150 --> 01:24.152
That means I'm serious.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.490
Good parenting, Jimmy.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.558
Kids will do anything
if you just say it

01:30.591 --> 01:32.326
low enough.
(in low voice):
Run to the store.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.127
We need some more beer.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.662
(in low voice):
And take 45 minutes.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.330
Your father and I
are feeling frisky.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.598
30 minutes
should be fine.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.835
Okay, I know it's stupid, but
I have tried everything else.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.338
Okay, Sabrina's here.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.375
I will start the intervention,
but you two promised to help.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.511
Hey, guys.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.180
Enough talk-- it's time
for you to listen.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.581
Now sit down.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.783
You're up, Jimmy.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.552
Okay.

01:59.887 --> 02:04.158
You know I love you, and
as difficult as this may be,

02:04.192 --> 02:07.161
I think it's time
that we have an honest,

02:07.195 --> 02:08.796
heart-to-heart talk
about something

02:08.829 --> 02:11.765
that we all feel
is becoming a problem.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.501
Okay, yes, sometimes
I eat dirt.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.736
So what? Einstein
ate dirt-- Einstein.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.641
This wasn't about the dirt,
was it?

02:22.276 --> 02:23.444
Is this about me mentally
counting the number of words

02:23.477 --> 02:24.645
I say in every sentence?
13.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.846
You know what?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.548
Burt was right;
I should just listen, okay.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.351
We feel you--
once in a while, but not often,

02:30.384 --> 02:34.522
yet more than we'd like,
but sometimes...

02:34.555 --> 02:36.390
Don't pull your weight when
it comes to taking care of Hope.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.459
Sorry, Jimmy, but the baby
would have been a grown-up

02:38.492 --> 02:40.328
by the time you finished
that sentence.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.629
I do lots of stuff with Hope.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.233
Yeah, but you only do
the fun stuff.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.740
I thought you were taking her
to the dentist.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.908
Oh, did you say "dentist"?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.345
Because we both thought
you said "play in the mud."

02:57.378 --> 02:59.680
I'm gonna grab some towels
and we can clean her up.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.527
W-Where have you been?

03:13.561 --> 03:14.328
We sent you out for socks.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.297
We're late
for the church pageant.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.965
We went to the carnival.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.867
Show her
what we won.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.536
You're gonna need to buy a
filter and a tank for that

03:22.570 --> 03:23.671
within the next
three hours.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.872
Bye, Hope.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.340
Bye, Mr. Swimmy-pants.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.510
Hair, gum.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.246
Bummer.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.785
Okay, you're right.
I do avoid the tough stuff.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.454
It's okay.
You can change.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.755
What if it's
hereditary?

03:41.789 --> 03:44.792
What if I just don't
have the parenting gene?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.594
Okay, it's called geophagy.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.529
I sense you have questions.
Go ahead.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.698
(sighs)
Do you have to wash your hands
before you eat dirt?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.566
If it falls on the ground,
is there a five-second rule?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.901
Have you ever
tried sand?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.035
Is Mexican dirt spicy?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.538
If you swallow an apple seed,
will you poop a tree?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.573
Oh, she's up again.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.676
Oh, it's the fifth time.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.582
(in low voice):
Hope, you have to go to bed.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.650
No.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.419
I don't know what to do.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.587
My voice doesn't go
any lower than this.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.656
You want to find out if you
have the parenting gene?

04:15.689 --> 04:16.990
Why don't you spend
the next two hours

04:17.024 --> 04:18.592
trying to keep her
in that bed?

04:18.626 --> 04:19.560
(sighs)

04:19.593 --> 04:20.728
Okay, I can do this.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.763
Okay.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.367
Hope,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.568
it's bedtime.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.403
I want you to go
into your room

04:29.437 --> 04:31.439
and I want you
to get in your bed

04:31.472 --> 04:33.341
and I don't want you
to come out until morning.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.376
Okay?
Okay.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.714
(chuckles)

04:42.383 --> 04:43.717
I'm gonna be
good at this.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.522
It's killing you,
isn't it?

04:48.556 --> 04:49.490
Of course.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.360
I'm a landscaper.
I'm surrounded by dirt.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.629
What if I've been wasting
money on food my whole life?

04:55.663 --> 04:56.830
Did you see that?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.399
Hope went into the bedroom.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.867
She's never done that for me.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.802
Look, don't beat yourself up
about it.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.437
You're like a Mr. Mom.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.572
Maybe Hope sees
Sabrina

05:04.605 --> 05:07.508
as the Mrs. Dad, you know,
the one who lays down the law.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.379
There are tons of sensitive,
nurturing fathers

05:11.412 --> 05:13.046
raising kids
all over America

05:13.080 --> 05:14.382
and on almost every TV show--

05:14.415 --> 05:15.383
except for Tim Allen.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.451
He's all man.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.786
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.655
Anyway, my point is,
Hope will be proud of you

05:21.689 --> 05:24.492
no matter what you are,
just the same way

05:24.525 --> 05:25.459
you're proud
of your dad.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.860
Ugh!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.629
Nope, nope.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.564
I'm still gonna need
to pack a lunch.

05:30.598 --> 05:34.402
* Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...

05:34.435 --> 05:37.705
(humming along)

05:41.875 --> 05:45.546
Hey, hey, hey!

05:45.579 --> 05:46.614
(blowing whistle)

05:48.115 --> 05:49.650
VIRGINIA:
Burt.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.652
I saw him.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.453
I saw the squirrel.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.855
Beady little eyes,
fluffy white tail?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.590
Yes, he's a monster.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.158
Right there in
broad daylight.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.727
He saw me watching,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.395
and I think he liked it.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.596
That little pervert
has no shame.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.164
We got to do something
about this.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.400
If we don't help the
victims, who will?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.769
The possums,
the groundhogs?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.604
They're afraid of
their own shadow.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.706
Humans are the smartest
in the animal kingdom,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.542
except possibly
the dolphins,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.578
but those arrogant bastards
aren't gonna do a damn thing.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.546
So what are we gonna do?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.681
We are going to make it
our life's mission

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
to catch that squirrel
and put an end

06:22.450 --> 06:24.785
to his rampage of
unwelcome humping.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.421
This might be the most
important thing we ever do.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.766
Hey, you guys don't see me
as a Mr. Mom, do you?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.768
FRANK:
Not me.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.637
I just think of you as a guy
who's obsessed with his kid--

06:43.671 --> 06:44.805
driving her all around,

06:44.838 --> 06:47.575
making sure her tights
match her outfit.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.977
That's exactly
what a Mr. Mom does.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.213
Oh, then, you are getting
a mug on Mr. Mother's Day.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.583
You know, I must
concur with Frank.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.917
The James we all know
has a tender heart

06:56.950 --> 06:58.452
and a gentler touch,

06:58.486 --> 07:00.754
which is why I always have
you stack the avocados.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.590
So what?

07:02.623 --> 07:05.659
You're a maternal guy
with beautiful, soft hands.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.160
There are worse things
you could be.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.896
True, I could be a dirt-eater.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.532
Einstein ate dirt-- Einstein.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.635
You know, I can sympathize
with you, James.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.069
Being raised
by two moms,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.105
I wasn't always the strong
masculine authority figure

07:18.138 --> 07:19.607
I am today.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.241
What helped me tap
into my rough-and-tumble

07:21.274 --> 07:22.976
was becoming an
auxiliary policeman.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.512
That's why
they call me

07:24.545 --> 07:26.146
Badass Barney around here.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.082
No, it's 'cause you have
an unattractive rear end.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.684
It's both reasons.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.520
Listen, James,
I'm going

07:32.553 --> 07:34.154
to be on patrol
all weekend.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.523
You should come with me.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.857
Oh, that would be amazing,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.258
but I can't.
I got to take care

07:38.291 --> 07:39.693
of Hope all weekend.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.994
No, Jimmy, you should go.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.763
Get your rough-and-tumble on
with Barney.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.532
I could watch Hope till Monday.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.933
Are you sure?
Yeah, of course.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.701
My God, that would be great.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.670
I have a uniform you can
borrow. N-Now, of course,

07:49.703 --> 07:50.838
I can't let you borrow
my achievement star,

07:50.871 --> 07:52.840
but I can show you
how I made it.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.675
You're welcome to tag
along, too, Frank.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.009
There gonna be
a lot of marching,

07:56.043 --> 07:57.511
hanging out with dudes?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.846
Not really.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.913
Pass.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.655
Yeah, little creep's
up there

08:07.688 --> 08:09.557
just wagging
his big white tail,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.692
not a care
in the world.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.693
Are you sure
these pellets

08:12.726 --> 08:14.161
won't hurt the
other squirrels?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.596
They're perfectly safe.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.797
I use these pellets
to relocate gophers

08:16.830 --> 08:17.731
all the time.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.999
The little black pellets

08:19.032 --> 08:20.901
put the gophers to sleep
so they don't suffer

08:20.934 --> 08:22.570
when the little white pellets
kill 'em,

08:22.603 --> 08:23.837
but, see,

08:23.871 --> 08:25.639
I always take
the little white pellets out.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.008
So the gophers just go to sleep?
Yeah.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.578
How can you be sure you haven't
accidentally killed one?

08:30.611 --> 08:31.679
I've been trapping
and relocating

08:31.712 --> 08:32.846
the same gophers
for years.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.982
They summer at the Millers'
and winter at the golf course.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.149
Crafty.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.685
How many gophers?

08:37.718 --> 08:40.854
Five-- Jackie, Tito, Marlon,
Jermaine, and Michael.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.222
(chuckles) Once,
when they were knocked out,

08:42.255 --> 08:43.924
I put a little glove
on Michael.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.225
You should have seen him
dancing around,

08:45.258 --> 08:46.827
trying to shake it off.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.861
(laughs)

08:47.895 --> 08:49.262
I'm remembering it now.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.032
(laughing):
That's hilarious.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.034
I'm sorry
you're missing this.
Me, too.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.869
I'm surprised they haven't
come up with something

08:55.903 --> 08:57.037
that you can plug
into both our heads

08:57.070 --> 08:58.706
so we can see each
other's memories.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.841
You know, I bet they will.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.910
I bet they will.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.011
(laughs)

09:04.044 --> 09:06.346
What's he doing now?
He's still just dancing around.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.916
(snickering)

09:08.949 --> 09:10.951
(mumbles)

09:15.388 --> 09:16.724
Ha-ha.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.192
Anyone else
smell pig?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.127
You know,
I'm surprised

09:20.160 --> 09:21.762
that thing fits you.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.797
Wasn't that Barney's uniform
from when he was fat?

09:23.831 --> 09:26.634
I look better
coming than going.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.968
Oh.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.971
You and I

09:31.004 --> 09:33.774
are going to have
so much fun this weekend.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.208
(whispering):
You want to go steal
some candy

09:35.242 --> 09:37.077
while the fake cops
are distracted?

09:38.311 --> 09:39.913
(grunts)

09:39.947 --> 09:41.982
BARNEY:
Well, James,

09:42.015 --> 09:44.952
are you ready to clean up the
mean streets of Natesville?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.821
I just hope you don't come
across any criminal mastermind

09:47.855 --> 09:50.257
who figures out
how to do this.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.994
Uncool, Frank.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.095
Don't worry, James.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.665
A good auxiliary policeman
always carries safety pins.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.900
It's the only weapon
we're allowed to carry.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.101
I need you
to open it, though.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.337
I always prick myself with the
pointy part and get an ouchy.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.201
So, what do we do now?

10:34.234 --> 10:37.838
Call the dispatcher,
let her know we're on duty,

10:37.871 --> 10:40.373
and she'll give us the
location of our first call.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.009
Eagle Nine awaiting
assignment,

10:42.042 --> 10:44.444
preferably
not in a hilly neighborhood.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.378
Oh, God,

10:45.412 --> 10:46.880
that's that idiot
from the grocery store

10:46.914 --> 10:48.181
who made his own badge.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.216
Shh.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.884
10-4, Eagle Nine.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.753
Patrol South Natesville.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.454
We're expecting some rough
stuff down there this morning.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.323
There's nothing going
on in South Natesville.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.058
I know, but if I make him feel
like a cop,

10:58.091 --> 11:00.127
he gives me
half-priced rump roast.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.963
It's good to know we've got
your boots on the ground.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.899
Sorry, James, I was gonna
let you sit up front and steer,

11:05.933 --> 11:08.168
but sounds like we have
a date with danger.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.039
(bell dinging)

11:12.072 --> 11:14.274
Turn signals... out!

11:21.882 --> 11:24.151
I hope it worked.
Oh, it worked.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.353
Ah.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.889
I forgot how much
Dancin' Dan likes corn.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.726
Let's just figure out which one
is our guy and go catch him.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.731
I don't see him.

11:37.765 --> 11:38.932
Starting to get a weird feeling

11:38.966 --> 11:40.801
like this whole thing's
some kind of trap.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.839
Ooh, there he is!
Get the skimmer ready.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.075
Soon as he hops on one of
those roofied squirrel girls

11:48.108 --> 11:49.977
and gets distracted,
we'll catch him.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.514
What the heck's he doing?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.851
Maybe the sick bastard only
likes it when they fight back.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.520
(squeaking)

12:00.553 --> 12:01.855
Ooh, ooh!

12:01.889 --> 12:03.056
Go, go, go!

12:05.859 --> 12:07.861
Ah!

12:07.895 --> 12:09.262
Should we kill him?

12:09.296 --> 12:10.798
We can't kill him.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.966
I only believe in the
death penalty for people.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.102
We should gouge his eyes out
like in the Bible.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.471
You only gouge his eyes out
if he's an eye-gouger.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.775
"Eye for an eye" means you do
to him what he did to them.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.277
Well, I'm not doing that.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.814
I guess we got to give
him life in prison.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.049
Isn't that basically
us having a pet squirrel?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.251
Pretty much.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.053
BURT:
Hey, Jimmy.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.055
How'd the rough-and-tumble
go? Bust any skulls?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.958
Not great. I spent eight hours
staring at Barney's sweaty neck.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.060
And I only got to experience
one real crime scene.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.130
This is... disgusting.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.132
(sighs)

12:45.165 --> 12:48.969
No matter how many times
you walk these streets,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.804
some things will still
turn your stomach.

12:50.838 --> 12:54.474
Now let's put these recyclables
where they belong.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.244
Glass.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.979
Aluminum.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.447
Glass.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.182
Oh, my God!
That's a foot!

13:02.215 --> 13:03.817
That's a human foot!

13:03.851 --> 13:04.584
(screams)

13:04.617 --> 13:05.853
It's a human foot!

13:05.886 --> 13:07.420
Oh, hold the boat.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.223
It's just a shoe with
a half-eaten burrito in it.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.862
Hopefully tomorrow
will be better.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.296
What's with the empty cage?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.167
Lockdown!

13:28.375 --> 13:29.409
Clear.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.080
Clear.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.850
(whispering): He's still
here somewhere, I know it.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.952
(whispering): Why did you
have a squirrel in a cage?

13:38.986 --> 13:39.987
Clear.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.222
I think he could
have gotten away.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.190
(screams)

13:43.223 --> 13:44.992
It's on me!

13:45.025 --> 13:46.326
The claws! The claws!

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
(grunting)

13:48.395 --> 13:50.197
He's in my ear!

13:50.230 --> 13:53.033
Why did you have
a squirrel in a cage?!

13:55.002 --> 13:56.469
Are you sure
you're okay?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.204
Yeah, mostly.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.872
I don't really
want to talk about

13:58.906 --> 14:00.373
what he tried to do
to my ear.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.875
That squirrel
is way too dangerous

14:01.909 --> 14:02.976
to be kept in a house with Hope.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.645
Well, if we can't kill him
and we can't keep him here,

14:05.678 --> 14:07.180
what are we gonna do,
release him?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.048
We're gonna have to.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.983
But we can't just
send him out there

14:10.017 --> 14:11.919
to be a repeat offender.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.187
I think we have to...
castrate him.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.356
Okay.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.325
I'll get the knockout pills.
You get the scissors.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.559
No, we can't do
it ourselves.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.362
Jimmy's missing part of an ear
from a haircut we gave him.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.565
We're not dabbling
in tiny testicles.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.238
I'm so happy I'm not really
involved in this story.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.344
DISPATCHER: Would the closest
unit please respond

14:37.377 --> 14:39.947
to 827 Variel Street
for a domestic disturbance call.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.448
Neighbors report
lots of yelling.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.050
Hey, let's take that call.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.117
We're not allowed
to do that.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.352
It's just
a noise disturbance.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.286
With a lot
of yelling.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.055
We can handle it!

14:48.088 --> 14:49.089
James, do not.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.223
(grunts)

14:50.257 --> 14:52.525
I really don't think
we should!

14:52.559 --> 14:56.063
Damn it, James, I let
you steer as a treat!

14:56.096 --> 14:58.631
If you have any final words
for your testicles,

14:58.665 --> 15:01.301
I suggest you say them now,
'cause in five minutes,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.136
you're gonna be
squeaking soprano.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.305
Oh, look, a pet squirrel.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.607
Unusual, impractical,
and unsanitary.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.708
(chuckles):
No, no, no.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.078
We're not crazy people
who keep squirrels as pets.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.246
No, we just need to have
this little bastard castrated.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.047
Excuse me?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.483
That little guy's
a sexual predator!

15:16.516 --> 15:18.085
He was chasing down the females

15:18.118 --> 15:18.952
and taking them
against their will.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.453
Just because they're not
wearing clothes,

15:20.487 --> 15:22.089
doesn't mean
they're asking for it.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.124
Hide your cats, hide your mice,

15:24.157 --> 15:26.093
'cause he's raping everybody
up in here.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.728
Have you guys ever been
to the zoo in springtime?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.597
Not that we don't appreciate
the vacation suggestion,

15:30.630 --> 15:32.432
but we're in a bit of a hurry.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.002
No, I'm just trying to say
that what you saw

15:35.035 --> 15:37.170
is a completely natural process.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.339
It's how animals mate.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.141
In fact, the female was probably

15:41.174 --> 15:42.742
giving off pheromones
to encourage him.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.244
Oh.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.046
I see what's going on here.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.480
Good old boy's club, huh?

15:47.514 --> 15:48.748
Blame the victim.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.151
Obviously we came
to the wrong place.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.419
We'll just go to another vet.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.155
But if this little guy dies in
some back-alley neutering job,

15:55.188 --> 15:56.589
it's on your conscience.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.158
I can't let you
take this squirrel.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.993
I'm releasing him
into the wild.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.361
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

16:01.394 --> 16:02.595
He's gonna hump!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.364
Virginia, cover your ears!

16:07.367 --> 16:11.404
If your daughter was a squirrel,
you would never have done that.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.340
(girl screams)

16:13.373 --> 16:14.207
(glass shatters)

16:14.241 --> 16:16.309
MAN: How many times
have I told you

16:16.343 --> 16:19.012
to keep your hands
off my work bench?!

16:19.046 --> 16:21.448
All right, you two,
hold her down.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.716
We got to do something.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.619
If you don't stand still,
I'm gonna cut off your finger.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.089
Cover me.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.493
Ah! Dang it!

16:33.526 --> 16:36.496
I have to start wearing
my thimble again.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.367
Natesville Auxiliary Police.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.403
Uh, you have the right to
voluntarily open up this door.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.573
What do you want?
I'm busy.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.208
Hurry up! It hurts!

16:48.241 --> 16:50.110
I know! Shut up!

16:50.143 --> 16:52.179
Do you know how to get
rid of splinters?

16:52.212 --> 16:54.647
I'm watching my sister's kids,
man; I'm in way over my head.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.050
Give me that safety pin.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.119
*

17:30.750 --> 17:32.319
Thank you, Officer.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.395
That vet sure treated us
like we're idiots.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.430
We're not idiots.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.764
Of course not.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.100
I mean, even if that is
how animals have sex,

17:47.134 --> 17:48.568
how were we supposed
to know that?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.738
Well, you're supposed to be
the expert.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.806
You're a landscaper.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.375
Your whole workday is outside.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.310
From 9:00 to noon,
you're in their world.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.312
I don't stare.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.647
I'm not a pervert.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.415
Who do you think I am,

18:02.449 --> 18:04.417
that creepy crow that hangs out
by the playground?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.786
I don't care
what the vet says.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.256
Any normal person
who saw what we saw

18:09.289 --> 18:11.291
would have hunted down
that squirrel, captured him,

18:11.324 --> 18:13.393
kept him in a cage
till he escaped,

18:13.426 --> 18:16.196
and then with no other options,
sentenced him to castration.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.900
We're not gonna tell anybody
about this, are we?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.702
Absolutely not.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.639
Hey, what are you doing here?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.675
I had to bring her home.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.677
I just couldn't
do it.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.280
I just don't think I have
what it takes to be a mother.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.182
I mean, God tried to tell me
by giving me narrow hips,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.349
but I just didn't listen.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.518
First, she wanted
to watch her

18:38.551 --> 18:40.153
Dee Dee the Dancing
Dolphin DVD.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.189
And I love Morgan Freeman,
but somebody has got to

18:42.222 --> 18:44.924
tell that guy that it is
okay to turn down a job.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.661
And when that was finally over,
Hope wanted to watch it again.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.462
And again.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.663
(dolphin squeaking)

18:50.697 --> 18:54.467
And again. And again.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.369
And then she wanted to play
"knock down the block tower."

18:56.403 --> 18:58.671
So I built her a block tower
and she knocked it down,

18:58.705 --> 19:00.473
while she watched
Dee Dee the Dancing Dolphin.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.641
Again.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.642
And again. And again.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.544
(groans)

19:04.577 --> 19:06.679
And then she wanted to
hear Harriet Hugs a Hippo,

19:06.713 --> 19:09.349
which, by the way, is ten
"H" words strewn together

19:09.382 --> 19:10.617
to make sentences,
all right?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.453
"Harriet happily hugs a hairy
hippo while a horse hugs a ham."

19:13.486 --> 19:16.189
And how do I know that? Because
I read it to her 20 times

19:16.223 --> 19:17.357
while she knocked
down the block tower,

19:17.390 --> 19:19.359
while watched Dee Dee
the Dancing Dolphin.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.630
Again. And again. And again.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.365
And that's when
I passed out.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.467
And that's when this happened.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.402
And that is when
I started calling

19:29.436 --> 19:30.603
random nannies
from my childhood,

19:30.637 --> 19:33.473
so I could go to the bathroom
and drink a peach martini

19:33.506 --> 19:34.974
and read US Magazine.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.844
And that is when I realized:

19:37.877 --> 19:39.512
I'm just like my mother.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.414
You're not like your mother.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.882
You love being with Hope.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.352
You're just better
at the fun stuff,

19:45.385 --> 19:47.520
and I'm better
at being nurturing.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.390
And it's okay,
as long as Hope has both of us.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.428
Oh, hey.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.564
While I was on patrol,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.266
I stumbled across
someone's organic garden,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.234
and I brought you a treat.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.535
(chuckles)

20:02.569 --> 20:04.271
They grew strawberries in this.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.873
I love strawberries.

20:06.906 --> 20:07.940
(chuckles)

20:13.380 --> 20:14.881
(sighs)

20:14.914 --> 20:16.549
Hope, what are you doing
out of bed?

20:16.583 --> 20:17.950
It's late.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.352
Let me do this.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.887
It's the one thing
I'm good at.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.624
Hope, I need you
to go back to bed

20:24.657 --> 20:26.293
and go to sleep, okay?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.394
No!

20:28.328 --> 20:30.363
Why isn't this working?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.299
I don't know.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.868
Hope, I said it's time
to go to bed.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.937
No, Mommy.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.809
She called me "Mommy."

20:44.611 --> 20:46.713
JIMMY: Sabrina may not have
proved to herself

20:46.746 --> 20:49.416
she was mother material,
but by spending a whole weekend

20:49.449 --> 20:52.585
doing all the hard work,
she proved it to Hope.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.488
And while being called Mommy
didn't make all the monotonous,

20:55.522 --> 20:57.390
boring parts of raising a kid
any easier,

20:57.424 --> 20:58.825
it made them worth it.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.428
Of course, the downside was
that once a kid bonds with you

21:01.461 --> 21:03.330
and knows that you love them
unconditionally,

21:03.363 --> 21:06.466
they aren't afraid
of you anymore.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.667
(doorbell rings)

21:07.700 --> 21:09.636
Right on time.
Come in!

21:09.669 --> 21:11.304
So, sometimes you have to call

21:11.338 --> 21:12.839
a professional
authority figure.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.608
Hope, go to bed this instant!

21:15.642 --> 21:17.043
(gasps)

21:21.814 --> 21:23.650
Well, glad I could help.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.685
I have to head down
to the hospital now

21:25.718 --> 21:27.387
and get a statement
from Dancin' Dan.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.755
Apparently, some sicko
drugged him in the park

21:28.788 --> 21:30.823
and gave him
a nasty ear infection.
