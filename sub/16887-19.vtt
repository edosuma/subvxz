00:00.050 --> 00:01.070
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.070 --> 00:02.700
<i>Here are a few things that
you might need to know.</i>

00:02.700 --> 00:05.080
Is there any way that Intersect
images can be taken out?

00:05.080 --> 00:06.055
Can it be removed?

00:06.133 --> 00:07.135
<i>Only Orion would know.</i>

00:07.170 --> 00:08.250
- Orion.
- <i>Hello, Chuck.</i>

00:08.250 --> 00:10.080
<i>It's good to finally
see you face-to-face.</i>

00:10.080 --> 00:11.363
<i>Those cards
you're looking at</i>

00:11.465 --> 00:12.650
<i>are the schematics
for the new Intersect.</i>

00:12.650 --> 00:13.176
<i>Study them.</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:14.660
<i>If you can find
FULCRUM's Intersect,</i>

00:14.660 --> 00:16.580
<i>you could get your
old life back.</i>

00:16.580 --> 00:18.870
I promised Ellie that I'd find
dad to walk her down the aisle

00:18.870 --> 00:20.337
<i>but I've tried everything.
He's nowhere;</i>

00:20.404 --> 00:22.174
<i>it's like he's fallen of the
face of the Earth.</i>

00:23.660 --> 00:24.488
Dad.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.630 --> 00:37.795
I'm sort of
freaking out here.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.030
I know.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.640
But he's your father,
and he seemed happy to see you.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.294
You think?

00:42.720 --> 00:45.087
I thought it was just lack of
recognition followed by shock.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.634
- You take cream?
- Huh?

00:48.100 --> 00:49.430
Yeah. No.

00:49.430 --> 00:50.280
Whatever's fine.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.113
I can't even remember
if I take cream.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.790
- Just relax.
- How?

00:53.790 --> 00:56.610
I-I haven't... I haven't seen
my dad for, like, ten years,

00:56.610 --> 00:59.970
and now I'm sitting in his
living room/kitchenette

00:59.970 --> 01:01.340
while he's making us coffee.

01:01.340 --> 01:03.907
Plus, let's just say the
last time I saw him,

01:04.030 --> 01:04.934
he was kind of--

01:05.630 --> 01:08.835
<i>I mean, he tended to be a little...</i>
What's the word? Crazy.

01:12.150 --> 01:13.197
Here we go.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.307
Thanks.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.605
So good to see
that face again.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.793
Yeah, yours, too.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.909
So, uh,
you doing okay?

01:33.340 --> 01:34.634
Who cares about me?

01:34.840 --> 01:35.859
Tell me about you.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.810
Uh, well, you know, there's not,
there's not much to tell.

01:38.810 --> 01:40.056
Graduated from
high school.

01:40.425 --> 01:42.185
Went to Stanford.
Work at Buy More.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.467
Stanford.
Not bad.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.043
He always was a genius--
this one.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.710
No, not like you.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.904
You're right.
He was smarter.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.010
What about Ellie?
How is she?

01:55.010 --> 01:56.897
Really great, actually.
Umm...

01:57.650 --> 01:58.997
She's a doctor now.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.580
And-and in a few weeks,
she's gonna get married to,

02:03.580 --> 02:05.861
<i>well,
an-an awesome guy.</i>

02:08.400 --> 02:09.561
Ellie's getting married?

02:10.509 --> 02:11.558
She is.

02:14.310 --> 02:18.462
That, uh, that's actually
mainly why we're here.

02:19.850 --> 02:20.721
Ellie was really hoping

02:20.807 --> 02:22.869
that you might be there
to walk her down the aisle.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.247
I don't think
she would want me there.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.250
I-I mean, of course,
of course she does.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.076
We both do.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.111
It's not a good idea.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.521
<i>But tell her
that I'm happy for her.</i>

02:35.440 --> 02:37.370
Are you, are you joking?
You have to do this.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.880
<i>She's your daughter.
Don't you want to be there?</i>

02:38.880 --> 02:40.290
Charles, I can't...

02:40.290 --> 02:42.540
I-I don't want to hear
what you can't do.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.352
I've seen
what you can't do.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.947
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

02:59.260 --> 03:00.280
That came out wrong.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.070
No, it didn't.

03:02.770 --> 03:03.789
You're mad.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.779
I left,
and-and you're mad.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.580
Look, Dad, I'm not even
here for me really, okay?

03:13.580 --> 03:14.454
Right now, I just...

03:14.516 --> 03:16.587
I want you to come
home for Ellie, please.

03:18.570 --> 03:22.434
I like you coming up here
and fighting for Ellie.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.156
Makes me happy you...

03:27.638 --> 03:29.411
at least
had each other.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.130
Let me get
a few things together.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.027
Are you okay?

03:48.250 --> 03:49.333
Yeah, I think so.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.303
I mean,
I'm glad we found him for Ellie.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.592
And for you?

03:58.390 --> 03:59.035
Yeah.

04:01.670 --> 04:04.224
Maybe he's not as crazy
as I remembered.

04:04.510 --> 04:05.105
<i>Okay.</i>

04:05.208 --> 04:06.942
Let's go get
your sister married, huh?

04:08.120 --> 04:10.782
Maybe we should wait till dark.
They're...

04:12.420 --> 04:14.155
They're tracking
my every move.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.906
<i>Rat bastards.</i>

04:55.870 --> 04:57.065
<i>So, I was thinking that</i>

04:57.138 --> 04:58.350
this would be perfect
for the rehearsal dinner

04:58.350 --> 04:58.985
'cause if I wear that

04:59.025 --> 05:00.600
<i>sage dress,
this will match perfectly.</i>

05:00.700 --> 05:02.485
- Sounds good.
- Or...

05:03.430 --> 05:04.533
Ellie, hey.

05:04.790 --> 05:05.650
Hey, Chuck.
Just a sec.

05:05.650 --> 05:06.641
We could do
the cranberry,

05:06.707 --> 05:09.896
which would really bring
out your, um, your...

05:12.630 --> 05:13.619
Hello, Eleanor.

05:18.590 --> 05:19.681
Aren't you
gonna say something?

05:23.970 --> 05:24.742
Pancakes.

05:26.570 --> 05:27.423
Oh, boy.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.670
You said you were
gonna make pancakes.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.342
Well,
that-that went well.

05:53.184 --> 05:53.799
Hey.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.027
You must be Devon.

05:57.130 --> 05:57.852
Yeah.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.630
Big TV.

06:04.020 --> 06:04.860
Ellie, I'm sorry.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.870
I should have called first.

06:06.870 --> 06:09.480
A surprise of this magnitude
wasn't the best idea.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.868
No, it's not your fault.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.085
I'm just...

06:13.070 --> 06:16.810
so mad at him,
our crazy old dad.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.013
Aren't you mad at him?

06:19.830 --> 06:21.540
I was, yeah.

06:21.540 --> 06:23.479
But then,
I realized that...

06:25.620 --> 06:27.280
You know, we can hate him
for the rest of our lives,

06:27.280 --> 06:28.671
or we can choose
to forgive him.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.405
It's easier to hate him.

06:32.910 --> 06:33.980
Well, that may be.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.096
But he's all
we got left, El.

06:36.070 --> 06:38.649
This could be our last chance
at being a family again.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.328
Let's go.

06:58.110 --> 07:01.195
I guess I was just, uh,
surprised to see you, Dad.

07:01.196 --> 07:01.820
Yeah.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.775
<i>I'm sure you were.</i>

07:11.140 --> 07:13.256
God, Ellie, y-you look
just like your mother.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.330
Sorry I left you
two alone like that.

07:20.330 --> 07:21.706
No, no, it's fine.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.497
Your dad was just explaining
our television to me.

07:24.550 --> 07:25.865
I was just telling, uh,

07:25.921 --> 07:29.889
Devon that I, um,
I practically invented your TV.

07:30.140 --> 07:33.040
I came up with these
helix-shaped plasma crystals

07:33.125 --> 07:34.710
back in high school.

07:34.710 --> 07:37.320
Um, never saw a dime for it.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.628
Okay, well, who's hungry?
<i>I'll order pizza.</i>

07:39.910 --> 07:42.137
Touch-screen technology.
<i>That was one of mine.</i>

07:42.370 --> 07:45.128
Uh, Ted Roark and I came up
with it back in grad school.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.121
Dad, you went to school
with Ted Roark?

07:48.290 --> 07:50.330
The Roark Instruments guy?
Awesome.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.695
Yeah,
he took all my ideas,

07:51.783 --> 07:54.360
<i>and, uh,
I-I never got anything.</i>

07:54.360 --> 07:56.511
<i>Guy's a...</i>
lying thief.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.600
Well, how about I, uh,
order the pizza. Pepperoni?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.330
Roark's releasing a
new software this week

08:00.330 --> 08:03.910
<i>that I guarantee has components
that I helped develop.</i>

08:04.690 --> 08:06.406
Yeah,
pepperoni sounds great, hon.

08:06.441 --> 08:07.735
<i>I still have my original</i>

08:07.811 --> 08:08.930
touch-screen schematics.

08:09.370 --> 08:11.398
And I...
I want to show you.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.330
Uh, D...

08:25.210 --> 08:27.867
<i>Okay, guys,
I'm really trying here, but</i>

08:27.923 --> 08:29.989
he is obviously
as crazy as we remember.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.970
<i>It seems Chuck's
flash matches a lot of chatter</i>

08:33.970 --> 08:36.339
<i>we've been hearing about
Roark Instruments lately.</i>

08:36.500 --> 08:39.096
<i>The CIA now believes
Ted Roark's latest software</i>

08:39.163 --> 08:41.746
<i>may contain a virus that,
if released,</i>

08:41.803 --> 08:44.870
<i>could cause irreparable damage
to the world's computer networks.</i>

08:44.870 --> 08:47.277
Why don't we just contact Roark
and tell them our concerns?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.387
<i>We can't out of fear of alerting
those who might be involved.</i>

08:50.420 --> 08:52.368
<i>Instead, we're going
to send in Chuck</i>

08:52.438 --> 08:53.810
<i>as a new RI employee.</i>

08:53.810 --> 08:56.798
<i>You will see if you flash
on anyone or anything.</i>

08:56.833 --> 08:58.583
<i>Your interview
is in one hour.</i>

09:01.300 --> 09:02.285
Are you okay
with that?

09:02.352 --> 09:03.440
Why wouldn't he be?

09:03.440 --> 09:04.880
Well, his dad went to school
with Roark.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.229
There could be
some history there.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.386
Your daddy issues gonna
jeopardize our mission?

09:08.660 --> 09:09.847
No, no, I'm fine.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.890
I mean, forget Apple.
Forget Microsoft.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.914
I've dreamt of
working for Roark since college.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.056
Although, does it actually
qualify as a dream come true

09:17.171 --> 09:18.180
if I go in as a janitor?

09:18.180 --> 09:20.300
You're going in as
Charles Bartowski.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.482
Your name, your resume,
your Stanford degree.

09:23.160 --> 09:23.791
Really?

09:24.710 --> 09:27.167
You're perfectly qualified
to go in as yourself.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.718
Me at RI?

09:56.025 --> 09:57.249
Oh, hey.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.955
You must be Chuck.

09:59.450 --> 10:00.317
<i>I'm Drew.</i>

10:00.470 --> 10:01.707
Welcome to
Roark Instruments,

10:01.815 --> 10:03.046
<i>where the
future happens first.</i>

10:03.120 --> 10:03.980
I love it here.

10:03.981 --> 10:04.687
<i>Huh.</i>

10:05.190 --> 10:06.360
<i>Everyone does.</i>

10:06.360 --> 10:07.607
Please,
have a seat.

10:10.150 --> 10:12.525
Oh, ri--uh, here, yeah.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.310
Sorry.
I'm not nor...

10:29.660 --> 10:32.428
So, I see
you went to Stanford.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.212
Me, too.
Class of '07.

10:34.690 --> 10:36.030
'07, wow.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.838
You-you've only been out
a couple of years?

10:37.873 --> 10:39.924
That's eons
in the software game.

10:40.270 --> 10:41.736
Come on.
Where you been?

10:43.050 --> 10:45.400
Seriously, tell me what you're up to
since you graduated.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.236
Uh, well, uh...

10:48.870 --> 10:50.573
<i>What have I been up to?
Uh...</i>

10:51.350 --> 10:52.471
Chuck, just be honest.

10:53.330 --> 10:56.810
Um, I've actually been
working at a Buy More, um...

10:56.810 --> 10:57.940
in the Nerd Herd division,

10:57.940 --> 10:59.135
which, you know,
has given me

10:59.208 --> 11:00.540
quite a bit of experience
working with,

11:00.540 --> 11:01.899
you know,
different computers,

11:01.981 --> 11:03.520
<i>operating systems,
technologies.</i>

11:03.520 --> 11:05.024
<i>You know, I've gotten
the opportunity to work</i>

11:05.097 --> 11:09.710
with many different...
unusual personalities.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.571
- Good morning, Big Michael!
- Woah!

11:20.200 --> 11:21.240
Where the hell
did you come from?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.850
We have a
proposition for you.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.810
I'll pass.
Excuse me.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.162
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.914
Two words:
NextExpo.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.550
- That's one word.
- Stop counting.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.738
Tomorrow is Roark's
Next Technology Expo

11:32.738 --> 11:33.390
<i>where they're
gonna be releasing</i>

11:33.390 --> 11:35.480
<i>their new operating
system to the entire world.</i>

11:35.480 --> 11:36.757
Now, we believe...

11:36.757 --> 11:40.650
that attending that release
will make us better employees.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.046
And better human beings.

11:42.550 --> 11:43.908
- NextExpo, huh?
- Yeah.

11:44.850 --> 11:45.906
Good thinking.

11:47.180 --> 11:48.124
Send Bartowski.

11:48.910 --> 11:51.062
- Chuck's not here.
- As usual.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.033
Okay, fine.

11:53.180 --> 11:53.920
<i>You both can go.</i>

11:54.220 --> 11:54.981
<i>Have fun camping out</i>

11:55.054 --> 11:56.250
at the
weirdo convention.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.350
<i>I would say probably
my greatest weakness is</i>

12:00.350 --> 12:02.355
how little I pushed
myself since college.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.029
I've been trapped in a job,

12:05.043 --> 12:07.971
<i>a life that I don't
really want, but...</i>

12:08.206 --> 12:10.421
Don't really
see a way out.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.228
Being here's a good start.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.652
Well, clearly,
you're qualified.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.205
And it doesn't hurt that
you're a fellow Stanford alum.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.245
I'd love for you
to take the job.

12:21.830 --> 12:22.529
Really?

12:23.190 --> 12:24.122
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

12:24.670 --> 12:25.480
Congratulations, Chuck.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.085
Wow, thanks!
W-Wait.

12:27.450 --> 12:28.599
Here we go.

12:28.697 --> 12:29.818
- There we go.
- There we go.

12:29.819 --> 12:30.698
- Okay.
- Bye.

12:30.870 --> 12:32.141
We'll work on those
ball skills.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.390
Hey, what's that?

12:36.570 --> 12:37.364
The lobby.

12:37.410 --> 12:38.802
- What's that?
- Elevator.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.629
- What's that?
- The bathroom.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.264
Man, this place is awesome!

12:47.170 --> 12:48.043
Over there's R&D,

12:48.100 --> 12:50.063
and that hallway
leads to our testing facilities.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.790
Sorry about the
shortened tour.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.620
We've been so busy with
this software release.

12:53.620 --> 12:54.317
All right.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.283
Right around here is...

13:09.020 --> 13:10.261
Hey, Ted,
this is Chuck,

13:10.296 --> 13:11.072
<i>our new employee.</i>

13:11.099 --> 13:12.837
Hey, welcome to RI.

13:14.030 --> 13:15.472
Never wash that hand.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.945
I never will, sir.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.646
No "sirs" around here.
Except for her.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.646
Well...
Okay, Ted.

13:28.860 --> 13:29.659
It's just a...

13:29.700 --> 13:32.190
It's just an honor to be here
and working for your company.

13:32.190 --> 13:33.755
Well, easy, big boy.
You already got the gig.

13:34.050 --> 13:35.226
Ready to
take over the world?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.838
Only 24 hours of camping
and NextExpo is ours.

13:44.839 --> 13:45.497
Because...

13:47.476 --> 13:48.367
<i>- Hey.
- I don't know what to say.</i>

13:48.433 --> 13:49.230
<i>I'm a little speechless.</i>

13:49.265 --> 13:50.280
<i>Welcome to the team.</i>

13:50.280 --> 13:51.199
Happy to
have you aboard.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.702
Oh, yeah. Uh...

13:53.016 --> 13:53.500
Wow.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.312
Think Morgan knows that Chuck's
cheating on the Buy More?

13:56.830 --> 13:58.772
<i>You know your boyfriend
just took a job at Roark?</i>

13:59.000 --> 14:00.705
Of course,
I was the first one he told.

14:00.920 --> 14:01.803
<i>You guys are over.</i>

14:02.140 --> 14:03.307
Yeah, okay.

14:08.080 --> 14:08.582
<i>It's weird.</i>

14:08.680 --> 14:09.720
<i>Even though I know
it's not real,</i>

14:09.720 --> 14:11.565
I am excited about this job.

14:11.670 --> 14:14.073
Chuck, you got to remember
it's just an assignment.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.697
No, I-I mean, I know...
I know what it is.

14:16.732 --> 14:17.307
I just...

14:17.860 --> 14:20.620
If I had gotten this job at
Roark right after college,

14:21.310 --> 14:22.819
maybe I'd never become
the Intersect.

14:23.050 --> 14:25.350
Then when my dad comes
back after ten years,

14:25.350 --> 14:27.067
I can show him that I'm not
just another loser

14:27.134 --> 14:27.950
working at a Buy More.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.726
Chuck, he knows
you're not a loser.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.069
Well, I'm sure he hoped
I'd be doing something

14:32.069 --> 14:33.377
a little bigger than
Nerd Herding.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.298
You are.

14:37.108 --> 14:37.902
<i>Cheers!</i>

14:40.330 --> 14:41.396
Charles!

14:41.570 --> 14:42.800
Perfect timing,
you two.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.600
- Oh, wow, I'm so starving...
- <i>Hey.</i>

14:44.600 --> 14:46.276
been sitting and waiting!
I'm sorry.

14:49.260 --> 14:50.067
Where you been?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.401
<i>Ah, well,
you know, working</i>

14:51.466 --> 14:53.876
saving the lives of small
technological devices.

14:55.410 --> 14:56.156
<i>How about a toast?</i>

14:56.890 --> 14:57.593
To family.

14:58.830 --> 14:59.431
<i>Uh, Dad,</i>

14:59.502 --> 15:01.872
we are extremely grateful
to have you home.

15:02.170 --> 15:02.929
Yes, we are.

15:03.140 --> 15:03.808
<i>Welcome.</i>

15:04.690 --> 15:05.555
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:05.730 --> 15:07.910
And-and,
here's to you and Devon.

15:07.910 --> 15:10.747
May you live
happily together forever.

15:11.140 --> 15:11.831
You deserve it.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.550
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

15:14.550 --> 15:15.694
When's the bachelor party?

15:17.320 --> 15:19.460
I, um,
I already had it.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.183
<i>And?</i>

15:20.854 --> 15:21.852
<i>How was it?</i>

15:22.050 --> 15:24.409
Oh, I don't really
want to talk about it.

15:24.444 --> 15:28.396
Well, okay, I got one.
How about um, to Chuck's new job?

15:28.790 --> 15:30.766
- What?
- <i>That's what I hear.</i>

15:30.920 --> 15:31.860
<i>You know,
Lester tells me that</i>

15:31.861 --> 15:32.800
you're leaving
your old buddy

15:32.800 --> 15:34.616
and the Buy More behind

15:34.616 --> 15:37.394
<i>to go all corporate over at</i>
Roark Instruments,

15:38.040 --> 15:39.813
<i>which, I get it,
pretty cool. So...</i>

15:40.150 --> 15:40.989
<i>Good luck, buddy.</i>

15:41.660 --> 15:42.855
Chuck, that's amazing.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.331
You going to work
for Roark?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.597
The man who stole everything
from me?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.410
Either this is a mission
or you two

16:07.411 --> 16:09.039
are very good
at hiding your hobbies.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.526
We're going in to
retrieve the source code

16:10.526 --> 16:11.790
for the new operating system.

16:11.790 --> 16:14.243
Without it, Roark can't release
the software or the virus.

16:14.278 --> 16:16.310
It's gonna take time to break
in the secured vault.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.552
Look, we need you to keep
an eye on Roark

16:17.552 --> 16:19.080
in case
anything goes wrong.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.190
Keep an eye on Roark?

16:20.190 --> 16:21.699
- What--
- Have a nice first day.

16:24.190 --> 16:27.523
<i>Everyone,
welcome to NextExpo 2009.</i>

16:28.750 --> 16:30.299
<i>Please.
One at a time.</i>

16:30.400 --> 16:31.924
<i>Miss, stay in line.</i>

16:32.368 --> 16:33.616
<i>Miss, hey--</i>

16:53.310 --> 16:54.720
Chuck!

16:54.720 --> 16:57.290
Hey, Chuck! Chuck, over here.
Chuck! Charles!

17:04.730 --> 17:06.002
He's already forgotten us.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.483
It's like he looked right
through me.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.460
Hey, not to add any extra
pressure to you guys,

17:12.460 --> 17:13.530
<i>but there's a
FULCRUM agent here.</i>

17:13.530 --> 17:15.220
<i>He's some kind of
computer terrorist.</i>

17:15.220 --> 17:16.941
Well, if FULCRUM is here,
it's even more vital

17:16.976 --> 17:18.175
<i>that we stop this launch.</i>

17:18.490 --> 17:19.393
Arigato.

17:19.990 --> 17:20.896
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

17:26.859 --> 17:28.116
Then you better hurry up.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.554
<i>Roark's about to
take the stage.</i>

17:30.160 --> 17:32.285
<i>Access denied.
Have an amazing day.</i>

17:32.310 --> 17:34.027
Damn it.
I'm gonna need to do a patch.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.946
Dad, you're really not
gonna watch that, are you?

17:38.790 --> 17:40.561
<i>I have to watch
Chuck's first day</i>

17:40.561 --> 17:42.366
<i>even if he is
working for Roark.</i>

17:44.590 --> 17:45.593
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

17:45.861 --> 17:48.450
<i>please welcome
the architect of the digital age</i>

17:48.450 --> 17:52.504
<i>and Time magazine's Man of the Year:
Ted Roark.</i>

17:57.580 --> 18:02.467
<i>Thank you.
Welcome to NextExpo 2009!</i>

18:04.840 --> 18:08.776
Or as I like to call it,
"Ted Greets the Little People."

18:08.777 --> 18:09.435
Just kidding.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.690
You believe this guy?

18:12.450 --> 18:14.226
<i>We've done some amazing
things this year.</i>

18:14.370 --> 18:16.300
<i>At least I have.
I mean, I...</i>

18:16.300 --> 18:18.647
<i>traveled around the
world in a hot air balloon...</i>

18:19.546 --> 18:20.937
uh, bought another island.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.524
<i>It's private.
Don't visit.</i>

18:23.560 --> 18:25.289
What else?
Let's see. Oh!

18:25.370 --> 18:27.616
And we invented a new
operating system

18:27.771 --> 18:30.212
that's going to
change the world!

18:39.060 --> 18:40.240
<i>Let's not waste
any more time.</i>

18:40.240 --> 18:41.541
<i>Do you have any idea
how much money I'm losing</i>

18:41.541 --> 18:42.384
<i>just standing here?</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:48.088
By pressing this button,
RIOS will be released.

18:48.630 --> 18:54.315
The whole world will have access,
free access to our latest software.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.370
It's happening.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.729
We're encountering security
we've never seen before.

18:59.070 --> 19:01.231
<i>Access denied again.
That's twice.</i>

19:01.410 --> 19:02.982
<i>Maybe I should call
security.</i>

19:04.251 --> 19:05.020
Uh-oh.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.789
Please tell me that was
a good "Uh-oh."

19:06.824 --> 19:08.081
<i>You know,
I love a countdown!</i>

19:08.500 --> 19:09.858
I'd like you to join me.
Ready?

19:10.660 --> 19:11.323
<i>Ten...</i>

19:11.510 --> 19:12.600
There's a countdown
happening.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.900
Okay, Chuck, listen,
we cannot access the source code.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.580
<i>You're gonna have to just,
just stop the release.</i>

19:16.580 --> 19:17.438
But I could get fired!

19:17.560 --> 19:18.956
It's not your real job.
Hurry.

19:19.430 --> 19:26.622
Six, five, four,
three, two...

19:26.690 --> 19:27.922
- No, wait!
- One!

19:33.720 --> 19:34.987
What the hell
are you doing?

19:35.740 --> 19:36.654
<i>Is that Chuck?</i>

19:36.720 --> 19:38.240
Wow, he's on stage.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.464
He must have
gotten promoted.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.710
No, no water pass
right now, okay?

19:41.960 --> 19:42.950
Get off the stage.

19:43.022 --> 19:46.340
I, uh, I... I, uh, I can't.
I can't. I'm so--

19:46.340 --> 19:48.715
<i>- Get off the stage!
- Go! Come on!</i>

19:48.910 --> 19:51.154
<i>Don't deny us
our new software, nerd!</i>

19:51.350 --> 19:52.507
You can't press that button.

19:53.130 --> 19:55.622
The CIA believes
that your software

19:55.684 --> 19:59.105
has been infected with a virus,
that when released,

19:59.140 --> 20:01.739
will cause
worldwide computer damage.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.870
Do you have any idea
how crazy you sound?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.150
Yeah, I do.
I do.

20:07.150 --> 20:09.240
But please,
you have to believe me.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.430
No, I really...
I really don't.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.980
I'm sorry for the
little technical delay.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.013
It must be
my rock star magnetism.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.056
<i>It drives
some people batty.</i>

20:31.460 --> 20:32.988
- Go, Charles!
- No, Chuck!

20:33.009 --> 20:33.559
- Go!
- Stop!

20:37.360 --> 20:38.130
That's great!

20:38.930 --> 20:39.864
That's my boy!

20:52.750 --> 20:53.681
Oh, no!

20:58.120 --> 21:00.438
And you call yourself
a Stanford man.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.879
<i>Let's get back to it.</i>

21:15.390 --> 21:18.625
Three, two, one...

21:29.830 --> 21:31.091
Have you heard
from my brother?

21:31.300 --> 21:32.423
Was I supposed to
hear from your brother?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.520
Chuck is not picking up.
Do you think he's in jail?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.780
Do you get a phone call
when you're in jail?

21:35.780 --> 21:37.328
In the movies, you get a phone call.
I don't know.

21:37.550 --> 21:40.392
I'm going to call 411.
Who do I ask for, the county jail?

21:40.427 --> 21:42.620
Ellie, I just worked an
18-hour shift.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.580
Now just slow down, honey.
Tell me what happened.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.808
Chuck freaked out.

21:45.854 --> 21:48.220
He hopped on stage at
some computer convention

21:48.220 --> 21:50.290
and tried to
attack his new boss.

21:50.290 --> 21:51.567
What?
Why would he do that?

21:51.602 --> 21:52.745
I have no idea.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.575
Although, we should
probably ask my dad.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.869
Since obviously,
you put him up to it.

21:58.970 --> 21:59.719
What?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.240
I didn't tell him
to do anything.

22:02.240 --> 22:02.870
Come on, Dad.

22:02.870 --> 22:04.840
Why else would he
throw away a job of a lifetime?

22:04.840 --> 22:08.110
Ted Roark isn't worthy of
your brother or his talents.

22:08.110 --> 22:09.412
It was a lousy job.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.790
And what do you call
working at the Buy More, Dad?

22:11.790 --> 22:12.934
Don't you get it?

22:13.410 --> 22:16.170
Chuck has been waiting for
ten years to impress you,

22:16.170 --> 22:18.260
and now this
opportunity comes along

22:18.260 --> 22:20.416
where he can follow
through on some crazy

22:20.416 --> 22:22.050
made-up vendetta
of yours.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.480
Trust me, sweetie.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.357
Your brother knows
what he's doing.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.534
You want me
to trust you?

22:27.569 --> 22:28.959
Ellie, maybe your dad's right.

22:28.994 --> 22:31.545
Maybe-maybe Chuck has
got a good explanation.

22:31.580 --> 22:32.920
Sure, Devon,
I'm sure he does.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.080
He probably just forgot the
whole thing happened, right?

22:35.080 --> 22:36.304
Just like
at your bachelor party.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.848
I'm sorry.

22:42.925 --> 22:44.190
I don't want
to drag us into this.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.090
I'm just really
worked up right now. So..

22:46.090 --> 22:48.042
I'm going to...
take a walk.

22:50.150 --> 22:52.258
- Ellie...
- Let her walk, Devon.

22:56.920 --> 22:57.747
Drink?

22:58.460 --> 22:59.384
No, no way.

22:59.455 --> 23:00.892
<i>That's what got me
in trouble in the first place.</i>

23:02.390 --> 23:03.208
What do I do?

23:03.400 --> 23:04.657
You're asking
the wrong guy.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.065
She's your daughter.

23:06.230 --> 23:07.865
Well,
I can't take credit for her.

23:08.980 --> 23:13.131
The only thing Ellie owes me is
a few well-deserved trust issues.

23:15.130 --> 23:16.462
You really
want my advice?

23:19.490 --> 23:20.635
Don't walk out
on your kids when

23:20.666 --> 23:22.508
you promised them
pancakes for dinner. They...

23:23.210 --> 23:24.451
tend to take it badly.

23:28.820 --> 23:29.768
You're a...

23:30.820 --> 23:32.447
real straight arrow,
aren't you?

23:32.750 --> 23:35.962
I used to be;
before this damn bachelor party.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.891
God, I'm such a jackass.

23:40.090 --> 23:40.925
Maybe.

23:43.570 --> 23:45.433
But that's not
why Ellie's mad.

23:48.370 --> 23:51.265
She just doesn't want you
to turn into me, which...

23:52.510 --> 23:53.919
take this as
a compliment--

23:53.919 --> 23:55.540
seems pretty damn unlikely.

23:56.340 --> 23:58.896
So come on,
have a drink.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.446
To straight arrows.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.156
Okay, all right.

24:29.270 --> 24:30.513
Show me what you
want me to do.

24:34.770 --> 24:36.672
<i>Why did you send me
these cards, Orion?</i>

24:38.600 --> 24:40.379
<i>Do you want me to
build an Intersect?</i>

24:41.031 --> 24:42.191
Or find an Intersect?

24:44.540 --> 24:46.739
<i>How can I use these cards
to find an Intersect?</i>

24:49.280 --> 24:51.400
Hey, I'm a little...
I'm a little busy right now.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.632
Just give me one minute.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.289
<i>And then you can go back
to whatever you were doing.</i>

24:59.800 --> 25:02.640
Ellie thinks you did what
you did at Roark for me,

25:02.640 --> 25:05.112
and if that's true,
I'll never forgive myself...

25:05.300 --> 25:06.954
- Dad--
- Still my minute?

25:10.760 --> 25:13.170
I ruined every good thing
that ever happened to me.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.494
My family, my job,
my entire life, thrown away.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.800
I won't stand by and
let the same thing happen to you.

25:21.800 --> 25:26.302
That's one torch
I'd rather not pass.

25:34.670 --> 25:38.900
If working for Roark is-is
that important to you,

25:38.900 --> 25:41.642
<i>then I-I think
you should fight for it.</i>

25:42.540 --> 25:45.896
And don't let my past
destroy your future.

25:50.060 --> 25:51.789
I miss getting advice
from you.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.652
Well, my minute's up.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.485
You were in the
middle of something.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.148
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

26:46.250 --> 26:47.619
Roark has an Intersect.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.319
What?

26:49.460 --> 26:51.750
An Intersect.
Roark has one.

26:51.890 --> 26:53.966
You thinks Roark is
hiding a supercomputer,

26:54.034 --> 26:56.020
the size of a football field,
<i>inside his office.</i>

26:56.020 --> 26:56.728
Yes!

26:59.340 --> 27:01.155
Well, maybe.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.730
What exactly
did you flash on?

27:02.900 --> 27:03.683
I...

27:04.940 --> 27:05.629
I...

27:06.670 --> 27:07.532
I didn't. I didn't.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.310
I didn't flash on
anything technically.

27:09.310 --> 27:11.140
I was just thinking.
But it makes sense.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.954
We know that
FULCRUM is working on

27:12.954 --> 27:14.700
trying to implant
intel into their agents,

27:14.700 --> 27:16.250
but they still need
a supercomputer--

27:16.250 --> 27:18.526
an Intersect,
to crunch all that data.

27:18.561 --> 27:20.546
Only someone like Roark
could do that.

27:20.570 --> 27:21.970
Ted Roark
is working for FULCRUM?

27:21.970 --> 27:23.020
<i>I know it sounds crazy,</i>

27:23.078 --> 27:25.340
but what if RIOS
is actually a Trojan horse?

27:25.340 --> 27:28.520
Like a virus designed to steal
intel from the government,

27:28.520 --> 27:30.704
corporations,
anybody, everybody.

27:30.739 --> 27:32.593
And you just thought this up,
out of the blue?

27:32.960 --> 27:34.284
<i>No flash, no proof?</i>

27:35.630 --> 27:36.920
Beckman will laugh
in our faces.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.458
Guess the apple doesn't fall too far
from the crazy tree, does it?

27:39.910 --> 27:40.749
<i>I'm sorry, Chuck.</i>

27:42.870 --> 27:44.176
Sarah...
Sarah...

27:45.650 --> 27:48.594
Think about what it could mean
if Roark has an Intersect.

27:49.430 --> 27:50.840
I could finally get this
thing out of my head.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.165
I need your help
to break into Roark's office.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.510
Beckman's orders
are clear.

27:54.510 --> 27:56.737
So are the consequences
of not following them.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.306
I'm sorry.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.327
Cute outfit,
Bartowski.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.774
- Give me that back.
- First, you tell me what it is.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.324
Interesting question.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.915
Those are designs
for the Intersect.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.939
You stole Roark's designs.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.590
Orion's.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.450
He sent them to me
before he died.

28:43.450 --> 28:44.808
There's a map
hidden in the plans

28:44.808 --> 28:46.480
that matches to layout
of Roark Instruments.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.731
Orion contacted you
and you didn't tell us?

28:49.510 --> 28:50.790
I think he wanted me
to break in.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.077
Yeah, and I want you to
take off my gear

28:52.077 --> 28:53.335
before I break your
geek neck.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.270
- Oh.
- I know what I'm doing.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.414
You have no idea.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.524
You're entering a
world of pain, Chuck.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.130
I want this Intersect
out of my head.

29:07.130 --> 29:08.250
Are you going to
help me or not?

29:08.250 --> 29:09.328
You got to be...

29:10.500 --> 29:11.689
Is that a tranq gun?

29:14.580 --> 29:16.618
You don't even have the common
courtesy to threaten me

29:16.653 --> 29:17.640
with an actual firearm.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.657
What's your answer, Casey?

29:18.950 --> 29:20.830
Put the toy down and
get your ass back...

29:44.180 --> 29:46.038
I'm going to kill you
when I wake up.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.603
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

30:31.310 --> 30:32.187
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

30:32.287 --> 30:33.775
<i>That's the oldest excuse
in the book.</i>

30:33.890 --> 30:35.062
<i>Yes, he knows me.</i>

30:36.230 --> 30:37.882
I want to see Ted Roark.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.157
- Just calm down.
- Look.

30:39.157 --> 30:40.115
<i>He might have
screwed me,</i>

30:40.182 --> 30:42.466
but I'm not going to let that
son of a bitch screw my son.

30:42.501 --> 30:43.980
Get your own hands
off of me!

30:43.980 --> 30:46.430
<i>Listen, you tell your boss
I'm not leaving this building</i>

30:46.430 --> 30:48.226
until my boy
gets his job back!

30:48.320 --> 30:50.172
What are you doing, Dad?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.566
What do you want me
to do with him?

30:54.150 --> 30:54.944
<i>Bring him in.</i>

30:55.230 --> 30:56.488
<i>We'll deal with it
in private.</i>

31:00.040 --> 31:01.080
Excuse me.

31:01.430 --> 31:02.972
Are you in charge
of these meatheads?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.920
Dad, Dad, Dad,
we have to go.

31:29.920 --> 31:30.900
We have to go right now.

31:30.900 --> 31:33.080
I can explain all of this
to you later.

31:33.270 --> 31:34.693
For now,
all I can tell you is...

31:35.520 --> 31:37.026
I'm not who you
think I am.

31:40.170 --> 31:41.453
It's good to
see you again.

31:43.270 --> 31:44.760
Good to see
both of you.

31:47.080 --> 31:47.978
Don't worry, Charles.

31:49.310 --> 31:51.075
I'm not who you
think I am either.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.061
<i>Hands up.</i>

32:11.230 --> 32:12.239
Are you coming?

32:13.230 --> 32:14.389
<i>We should go,
Charles.</i>

32:16.960 --> 32:17.689
Oh, my God.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.098
You're Orion.

32:23.990 --> 32:24.821
We should hurry.

32:33.260 --> 32:34.898
Casey,
where's Chuck?

32:40.900 --> 32:42.268
In a world of pain.

32:42.940 --> 32:43.882
I can't believe this.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.849
My father
invented the Intersect.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.063
That's not true.

32:47.230 --> 32:48.916
I didn't invent all of it.
Just...

32:49.260 --> 32:50.517
The really cool stuff.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.051
Come on.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.173
Granted, I can understand
how this might

32:57.173 --> 32:58.450
complicate a few things.
This way.

32:58.450 --> 32:59.668
What?
Complicate a few things?

32:59.698 --> 33:00.560
Dad, I saw you die!

33:00.560 --> 33:02.200
I saw you explode
in the helicopter.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.246
But I see how I could've
given you that impression.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.884
I've had to die
quite a few times.

33:05.890 --> 33:07.469
One of the perils
of being Orion.

33:08.670 --> 33:09.837
This isn't
what I wanted, Chuck.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.106
But when I realized
what the government

33:12.106 --> 33:13.290
<i>was going to do
with the Intersect,</i>

33:13.290 --> 33:14.364
<i>I had to run.</i>

33:14.520 --> 33:15.776
And your guys wouldn't be
the only ones

33:15.776 --> 33:16.627
who are looking for me,

33:16.920 --> 33:17.712
and more importantly...

33:19.050 --> 33:21.079
I knew I had to stay away
from you and your sister.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.267
Come on.

33:26.780 --> 33:27.648
<i>Wait, Dad.</i>

33:28.510 --> 33:29.576
You were protecting us?

33:32.340 --> 33:34.017
I knew I'd have to spend
the rest of my life

33:34.063 --> 33:35.635
hiding from the Intersect,
but...

33:37.290 --> 33:39.421
I never imagined
that it would find you.

33:42.210 --> 33:43.835
It must be such a curse to have
all those secrets

33:43.885 --> 33:44.902
trapped in your head.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.088
That's why I came back.

33:49.420 --> 33:51.350
That's why I let
your handlers find me.

33:52.270 --> 33:53.149
<i>It's my fault...</i>

33:53.359 --> 33:55.450
that FULCRUM's
after both of us now.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.947
You wanted me to flash
on your crazy schematics.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.560
You wanted me
to break in here.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.870
Why didn't you just say
who you were?

34:01.870 --> 34:02.808
Would you have
trusted me?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.530
After not seeing me for ten years,
I just appear,

34:05.530 --> 34:08.310
bring you to RI and tell you that
I can get the Intersect,

34:08.310 --> 34:10.690
which I also built,
out of your head?

34:10.690 --> 34:11.809
What would you
have said to that?

34:13.510 --> 34:14.810
That you were a
little bit crazy.

34:14.810 --> 34:15.605
Exactly.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.576
Now, punch in the code or
we'll be a little bit dead.

34:18.710 --> 34:20.040
Listen, no, Dad,
you don't understand.

34:20.040 --> 34:20.830
It doesn't work like that.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.521
Unless it's in here,
I can't do it.

34:22.770 --> 34:23.659
Yes, you can.

34:23.989 --> 34:26.940
I designed that computer
in your head, son.

34:27.730 --> 34:28.483
Flash.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.523
And it'll be the last thing
you ever have to flash on.

34:53.900 --> 34:54.829
Aces, Charles.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.679
That's the Intersect?

35:08.140 --> 35:10.529
2.0.
My baby.

35:11.270 --> 35:12.564
My greatest creation.

35:13.230 --> 35:15.671
After you and your sister,
of course.

35:16.610 --> 35:17.976
Let's make
that the hot seat.

35:21.140 --> 35:23.942
We need to make some minor
modifications to Roark's software.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.130
So, uh, what exactly
does your new program do?

35:42.130 --> 35:44.340
Well, usually the Intersect
works in the other way around,

35:44.340 --> 35:45.665
but I don't see
any reason why

35:45.665 --> 35:47.365
it shouldn't be able to
take out information.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.634
In theory.
<i>At least.</i>

35:52.180 --> 35:52.876
What you're going to see

35:52.932 --> 35:55.115
are a bunch of encoded images
that will cancel out

35:55.172 --> 35:57.192
<i>the ones
that you originally uploaded.</i>

35:57.950 --> 35:58.637
Wait.

35:59.780 --> 36:02.110
Are you saying you're gonna
overwrite my brain?

36:02.560 --> 36:04.627
That's a good way
of putting it, yes.

36:11.050 --> 36:12.016
- Ready?
- No.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.805
Your glasses.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.931
Oh. Yeah, right.

36:20.130 --> 36:21.046
Good luck, Charles.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.544
Something's wrong.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.246
<i>No, no...</i>

36:37.247 --> 36:38.381
<i>No.</i>

36:38.840 --> 36:39.802
It's not working!

36:40.870 --> 36:43.169
No, it doesn't work.

36:44.860 --> 36:47.581
But I'm sure you'll have it up
and running in no time.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.210
You always did have a way
with machines, Orion.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.576
And remember?
I always had...

36:55.250 --> 36:57.105
Well, I always had a way
with the girls.

36:57.990 --> 36:58.565
Remember?

36:59.750 --> 37:01.300
<i>Hey, come on, man.
What's the matter?</i>

37:01.910 --> 37:03.473
No hug
for your old partner?

37:04.540 --> 37:05.144
No?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.456
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

37:09.050 --> 37:11.708
<i>The years have
been unkind.</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:14.164
I could offer you
a good moisturizer.

37:14.610 --> 37:15.246
Huh?

37:16.030 --> 37:17.664
No? Okay.

37:18.450 --> 37:19.918
Put him
on the helicopter.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.293
Kill the CIA agent.

37:22.328 --> 37:23.104
He's my son.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.674
He's your son?

37:26.110 --> 37:27.665
Congratulations!
That's great!

37:27.750 --> 37:29.754
I had no idea.
Kill the son.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.460
Wait, I-I'll...

37:36.280 --> 37:37.798
I'll build anything you want.

37:39.730 --> 37:41.473
Give FULCRUM
their Intersect.

37:41.770 --> 37:43.285
But my son walks away
from here.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.111
You'll build it either way.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.117
You're gonna torture me?

37:47.206 --> 37:48.640
After ten years away
from my family?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.431
My son walks away!

37:50.610 --> 37:51.830
All right, all right.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.150
I'm not a monster.

37:55.630 --> 37:56.648
<i>I mean, I'm...</i>

37:57.500 --> 37:58.953
Little bit of a monster.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.554
But today
is his lucky day.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.747
Shotgun on the chopper!
Let's go.

38:19.420 --> 38:20.138
Charles.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.116
Take care of your sister.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.849
- No--
- Take care of yourself.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.864
- Dad?
- You can do this without me.

38:27.270 --> 38:28.318
I'm not gonna
leave you.

38:28.353 --> 38:30.558
Remember when I told you
not to trust your handlers?

38:39.520 --> 38:40.687
Maybe I was wrong.

38:42.930 --> 38:44.305
<i>If your son's gonna walk,</i>

38:44.430 --> 38:45.907
he should do it now.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.439
Good-bye, Chuck.

38:51.970 --> 38:52.703
No!

39:08.070 --> 39:09.796
<i>In our raid of
Roark Instruments,</i>

39:09.817 --> 39:12.923
<i>we failed to retrieve either the
Intersect or Stephen Bartowski.</i>

39:13.110 --> 39:15.950
<i>Clearly, we recognize that
FULCRUM's possession of Orion</i>

39:15.950 --> 39:18.000
<i>poses an unparalleled
security threat.</i>

39:18.000 --> 39:20.260
You mean FULCRUM's
possession of my father.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.202
<i>I promise you.</i>

39:21.370 --> 39:24.451
<i>No one at the CIA knew your
father's secret identity.</i>

39:24.750 --> 39:27.980
<i>I also promise to entrust
his recovery to our best team.</i>

39:27.980 --> 39:30.046
General,
we are your best team!

39:32.870 --> 39:33.980
Can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

39:33.980 --> 39:34.842
Chuck's right.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.900
No, you cannot put
Chuck back in the field.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.770
It is too dangerous.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.593
FULCRUM knows
that he is Orion's son.

39:42.540 --> 39:46.901
Look, as soon as my dad finishes
the new Intersect for Roark,

39:47.590 --> 39:48.807
I'm worthless to you.

39:48.940 --> 39:51.283
<i>Obsolete.
And FULCRUM wins.</i>

39:52.080 --> 39:53.497
<i>The only thing
that matters now</i>

39:53.558 --> 39:54.856
is getting my father back.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.922
And you need me
to do that.

39:58.820 --> 40:00.820
<i>Very well,
Mr. Bartowski.</i>

40:00.820 --> 40:02.184
<i>The assignment is yours.</i>

40:02.276 --> 40:04.230
<i>Provided your
personal entanglements,</i>

40:04.230 --> 40:06.470
<i>do not interfere
with the mission.</i>

40:22.360 --> 40:23.202
Dad?

40:28.120 --> 40:29.683
Ellie, I don't know how
to tell you this,

40:29.763 --> 40:32.481
but I think your
dad may have split.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.193
His stuff's all gone.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.698
Hey, hey, I'm sure he's planning on
coming back for the wedding.

40:44.340 --> 40:45.762
No, no, he's not.

40:48.290 --> 40:52.079
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm not going anywhere.

40:52.460 --> 40:53.311
Ever.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.536
I mean, no matter how
hard things get between us.

40:57.590 --> 40:59.529
Because that's what
married people do, right?

41:04.380 --> 41:07.206
Just think.
In 50 years, we'll walk back

41:07.261 --> 41:08.773
on my bachelor party
and laugh about it.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.345
No.
No, we won't.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.596
Or maybe not.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.759
<i>Chuck?</i>
Are you okay?

41:16.730 --> 41:19.617
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Only my career was injured.

41:20.790 --> 41:23.645
Chuck, um...
Dad's gone.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.038
I yelled at him about what
happened at your work today.

41:27.094 --> 41:28.630
I think
I said some things that--

41:28.665 --> 41:29.632
Ellie, it's not your fault.

41:29.667 --> 41:32.412
Well, no. It's my fault
that I asked you to find him.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.940
I thought I needed him
to walk me down the aisle.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.478
I thought that
he would be different

41:36.542 --> 41:38.249
from that guy
that walked out on us.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.048
I guess I just expected
too much from him.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.594
Don't count him out yet.

41:52.327 --> 41:58.278
