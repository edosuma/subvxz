01:41.935 --> 01:43.846
AND IF I'M NOT,

01:45.731 --> 01:47.768
IT MEANS I'VE DROPPED
DEAD EN ROUTE,

01:47.816 --> 01:50.604
AND YOU CAN BRING ME A BOTTLE

THAT YOU'RE A PASSIONLESS
VEGETABLE BY SPEAKING YOUR MIND.

IF I'M A
PASSIONLESS VEGETABLE,

02:37.282 --> 02:40.650
IT'S BECAUSE MY GARDENER
