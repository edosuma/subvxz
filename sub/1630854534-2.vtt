00:37.440 --> 00:38.480
Hmm?

00:42.280 --> 00:45.400
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Stop.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.760
What are you doing?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.600
Ash? Ashley.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.599
Oh, God.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.680
Oh, no!

01:06.720 --> 01:08.800
No!

01:08.840 --> 01:09.880
What?

01:35.120 --> 01:40.280
Hey. Sorry.
Hi.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.880
I'm just heading off to work.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.640
Did you sleep OK?

01:43.680 --> 01:46.960
You have any issues
throughout the night at all?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
What time is it?
Ah, it's 6:15.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.080
Oh.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.280
Listen, hey. Sorry.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.000
So, thanks for staying last night.
I do appreciate that.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.320
So, thanks for staying last night.
I do appreciate that.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.440
Yeah, no worries.
So, the job was good, eh?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.480
Yeah, no...no trouble.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.080
So, just um...
You're good to head off, yeah?

02:08.120 --> 02:09.640
What? Head off?

02:09.680 --> 02:11.440
Well, no, no, not head off.
That sounds bad.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.400
But you're good to decide today
where you're gonna stay

02:14.440 --> 02:15.560
from now on, both of you?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.200
Sorry.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.520
What time is it?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.640
It's still 6:15.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.840
You just said something last night

02:21.880 --> 02:24.120
maybe you might stay
at your Mum's place?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.600
Fuck no. Was I drunk?

02:25.640 --> 02:27.080
Oh, maybe, I'm not sure.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.400
But you definitely said

02:28.440 --> 02:30.880
you would find somewhere else
to stay today.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.520
So, just making sure
you're good for that.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.200
OK.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.640
We'll be out by tonight.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.920
I don't mean to rush you.
I feel like you do.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.040
No, no, no, I'm just late for work.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.120
You've got my number

02:43.160 --> 02:44.640
so, and you know
where the bathroom is,

02:44.680 --> 02:46.600
so, you know,
there's a toilet in there

02:46.640 --> 02:47.680
and you can use that anytime.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
Ah, I gotta get going.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.760
But you know where it is.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.040
You know where everything
is in the kitchen

02:51.080 --> 02:52.080
and the toilet and stuff.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
So, let me know how you go.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.200
What an arsehole.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.000
6:15? Fuck that.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.560
6:15? Fuck that.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.600
(THEME MUSIC)

03:31.400 --> 03:33.880
So, wait, she was there
when you got back?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.280
Dude, she's still there now.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.760
Oh, damn, brother! Smooth!

03:38.800 --> 03:41.000
No, dude, nothing happened.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.880
Except, oh, except
something happened.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.000
Something kinda fucked up.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.960
What's happened?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.920
So, I'm asleep, right?

03:51.960 --> 03:53.000
And um...

03:54.560 --> 03:55.560
Just gotta take this. Hang on.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.160
No, no, just tell me.
Just tell me! Come on, quick, quick!

03:58.200 --> 03:59.560
Just hold on for a second.
What happened?

03:59.600 --> 04:00.000
Oh, would you just shut the fuck up?

04:00.000 --> 04:00.800
Oh, would you just shut the fuck up?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.120
Gordon, it's Dr Bruce.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.200
I'm sorry. Um, hello.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.600
Ah, is everything OK?

04:05.640 --> 04:08.040
Oh, Gordon,
much as we'd expect, really.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
AFP was normal,
which is the main one.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.920
PSA and CEA are all normal,

04:12.960 --> 04:14.360
so there's nothing to worry
about it there.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.440
OK, good.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.480
You've just never called me
before after a check-up,

04:17.519 --> 04:18.560
so I was a bit worried.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.959
Oh, we don't want you
to worry, Gordon.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
No.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.760
So, all the test results
are good then?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.560
Bloodwork is good.
Great.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.320
The urine's come back a little high,

04:29.360 --> 04:31.480
though, so I'd like to get you
in for a follow-up.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.760
Has the cancer come back?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.120
Is that what you're saying?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.960
Cancer, Gordon,
is just a catch-all term

04:39.000 --> 04:40.720
for irregular cell growth,

04:40.760 --> 04:44.240
so I don't think it's helpful
to talk about cancer at this stage.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.160
Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.520
You right?
Sorry. Fuck it!

04:48.560 --> 04:53.040
Oh! Ooh! Fuck.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.840
You OK, man?
Yeah, good, good. You're good.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.480
Sorry about that.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.480
Yes, I know
what cancer is, Dr Bruce.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.000
You have diagnosed me
with it before.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.280
You have diagnosed me
with it before.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.840
And we caught it in time,
didn't we Gordon, hey?

05:04.880 --> 05:05.880
So, there's no issue.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.720
I'd just like to get you
in for a follow-up.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.240
Sorry, are you eating?
Yes.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.720
Just a bickie. Are you eating?
No!

05:13.760 --> 05:17.360
I'd like to order a cystoscopy
as soon as you can manage it.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.880
What is that? Removal of a cyst?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.760
No, no, nothing like that.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.360
It's just to have a look
at what's going on inside

05:23.400 --> 05:27.200
by the insertion of a small camera.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.560
Up my penis?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.560
I wouldn't worry, Gordon.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.040
OK, I'll call
to set up an appointment.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.200
Thanks, Dr Bruce.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.400
Ah, shit.
You OK?

05:37.440 --> 05:40.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright.
What's happened?

05:40.360 --> 05:44.840
Nothing that was a...
a business...order.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.280
With your special house guest.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.480
Yes.
Ah, so, she pissed in my drawers.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.640
Congrats, mate.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.000
How many drops
is he s'posed to have?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.800
How many drops
is he s'posed to have?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.080
OK.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.840
Yum!

06:06.880 --> 06:08.360
Yummy-yummer!

06:09.480 --> 06:10.520
Oh!

06:13.800 --> 06:14.840
Hello?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.200
Mum?

06:19.240 --> 06:21.560
Erin's been raped.
Oh, my god!

06:23.000 --> 06:26.320
Wait, who's Erin?
Erin. Your friend Erin!

06:26.360 --> 06:28.200
I don't...

06:28.240 --> 06:31.960
Oh! Oh, Erin Shepley?
From primary school?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
I'm still close with her mother.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.120
No, you're not.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.280
Why're you telling me this?

06:36.320 --> 06:38.000
Did you come all this way
just to tell me this?

06:38.040 --> 06:40.400
Yes!
Are you gonna ask me in?

06:40.440 --> 06:41.960
How'd you know where I was?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Find my iPhone.
Oh, that's...fucked up.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
What?

06:46.080 --> 06:48.000
Don't you want to be part
of the family plan anymore?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.920
That is so unfair.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.560
Look, I was worried.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.240
The news about Erin really shook me.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.520
Did it?

06:55.560 --> 06:57.760
Move over, I'm coming in.
No, you're not.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.000
I am. Beep-beep!
You can't block a woman.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.120
I am. Beep-beep!
You can't block a woman.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.520
God, you're so good at that.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.080
Oh, God, the lamp's alive.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.520
No, this is...this is Colin.
He's kind of my dog.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.000
What's wrong with him?
Is he broken?

07:11.040 --> 07:14.480
He's not broken.
Colin, this is your grandma.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.520
Say, "Hi, Grandma."

07:15.560 --> 07:17.840
Now, don't be ridiculous, Ashley.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.240
I will never be called Grandma.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.040
Just Lynelle,
or something cute like Gaga LynLyn.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.080
Right, OK.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.600
And you don't need a dog.
You can barely look after yourself.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.760
What about your studies?

07:26.800 --> 07:27.840
I'm...
What's he do?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.880
Um, he runs a brewery or something.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.320
Very hip. Cute?

07:31.360 --> 07:34.320
He's fine.
It's about the dog. We hit this dog.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.840
Well, you've gotta
start somewhere, darling.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.280
I pretended to like Italian cars
to land my ex.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.560
Can you stop calling him your ex?

07:39.600 --> 07:40.760
He's my Dad.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.120
What's this?

07:42.160 --> 07:43.840
Brewer's Best 2019.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.360
Mum, stop!
Who's Gordon Crapp?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.400
What?

07:47.440 --> 07:50.960
With two Ps?
Gordon Crapp. Oh, no.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.040
Oh, my god.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.040
I thought Gordon was bad.
Oh, that's funny.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.560
Oh, darling, forget this one.
You can't be Ashley Crapp.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.000
Imagine, A Crapp. I don't think so.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.240
Imagine, A Crapp. I don't think so.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.960
Yeah, I'm not marrying him, Mum.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.480
Google?

08:04.520 --> 08:08.000
How much is this house worth?
That's an oil diffuser, Mum.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.480
Is it?
Yeah.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.560
Quite nice.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.200
What's his Manchester like?
What?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.280
Its key, darling.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.480
You want high-end,

08:14.520 --> 08:16.600
but if the thread count's too high,
could be gay.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
Jesus, Mum.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.360
Where's his bedroom?
Don't go up there.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.000
Just for a minute.
Do not! Stop it.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.160
Mum!

08:26.640 --> 08:29.320
Cheap.
Good, can we go now? Come on.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.919
Oh! It's all wet!

08:32.960 --> 08:35.440
What? Move.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.480
Dear God!

08:37.520 --> 08:39.640
Oh, fuck! Fuck it!

08:39.680 --> 08:42.640
Oh, Ashley, you didn't!
I thought you were past all this.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.159
I am. I am, Mummy!

08:44.200 --> 08:46.600
Oh, it's like year ten camp
all over again!

08:46.640 --> 08:47.760
Don't! Stop it!

08:47.800 --> 08:50.560
But you can't blame
Renee Granville this time!

08:52.600 --> 08:55.000
Well, you can't stay here.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.680
Not if he knows about this.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
You're gonna have to come home.
You need your mother's touch.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.000
Mama, stay out of this.
I do not know why you're here.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.880
Mama, stay out of this.
I do not know why you're here.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.400
I told you. Erin!

09:03.440 --> 09:05.000
I worked on all these boundaries

09:05.040 --> 09:06.160
with my therapist.

09:06.200 --> 09:10.200
You don't need boundaries.
Just come home, darling.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.920
What have I done?
Oh, my god, I wanna die!

09:16.200 --> 09:18.440
I really don't think
Costco's the place for this, Mum.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.680
Costco's the place
for everything, darling.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.240
I'm a gold member.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.800
Lightly crumbed calamari,
they've got it.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.240
Fertiliser, they've got it.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.720
I need drawers.
They've got it!

09:27.760 --> 09:30.160
And they don't make a cent
on this stuff, Ashley Marie.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.720
They actually lose money
on the roast chickens.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.400
I don't think
the drawers will match, Mum.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.080
I should get
a roast chicken, actually.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.120
And that's it.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.240
That's why you got me to Costco,
'cause you need a chicken.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.360
Oh, come on.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.200
Hey, Meggles.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.160
I'm out the front, Babe.
You close?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.600
Where did you park, Megan?
It's quite full for a Tuesday.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.720
No, you're not parking.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.480
Just...just pull up over here.
Drop off.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.040
We're just coming round the corner.
Ah.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.080
That's us.
OK.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.160
That's us.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.680
Why can't I come with you, girls?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.000
No, we're just in and out, Mum.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.000
Well, you two can go shopping.
I'll look after Gollum.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.400
Well, you two can go shopping.
I'll look after Gollum.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.520
Colin. No, he's coming with me.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.760
You gonna take
your sunnies off, or...

10:05.800 --> 10:07.440
Nuh.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.920
Did you go out with Ryan last night?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.040
Yeah.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.280
Did you take Dexies?
Yeah.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.880
Fucken nurses, man!

10:13.920 --> 10:15.640
Access to all the drugs.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.720
Oh, hi.
Hi.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.080
You guys still do
above-ground pools?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.920
What? I don't work here.
Oh, sorry.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.400
Come on.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.000
OK.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.520
This is actually pretty good.
60 bucks.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.600
OK!

10:31.640 --> 10:33.920
You know, he's gonna know
they're not the same.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.760
Yes, thank you, Meggles.
I do know that.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.840
Excuse me?
Yeah?

10:37.880 --> 10:39.560
Have you sold out
of digital grand pianos?

10:39.600 --> 10:43.320
I don't work here!
Sorry.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.520
I think I saw them, though.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.760
Somewhere like over there.
Thanks.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.840
What's going on?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.520
Do you like him or something?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.400
The guy?
No, it's about this dog.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.640
You know, we hit this dog...

10:54.680 --> 10:56.080
No, he hit the dog.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.160
Yeah, but I...helped him...

10:57.200 --> 10:59.520
No, Ash, listen to me, OK?

10:59.560 --> 11:00.000
You're not over James,
you're on Austudy,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.080
You're not over James,
you're on Austudy,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.440
and you've been
kicked out of your house

11:03.480 --> 11:05.880
because of a dog that he hit.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.440
Sixth-year prac is mental...
I know.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.800
Am I right?
I know.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.880
You gotta focus on you, babe.
Like call him.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.320
Tell him,
"Thanks for the weird memories."

11:14.360 --> 11:17.320
But you're out.
He can keep the dog. Ta.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.400
And can we sit down?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.320
Can you not yell at me in Costco?

11:21.360 --> 11:22.800
I'm sorry, call him.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.080
And we don't have
this little cutey anymore,

11:25.120 --> 11:28.360
you can come and stay on Nan's couch
till you find a place.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.200
Why can't I just come with him?

11:30.240 --> 11:32.520
Nan's already pissing herself
in a wheelchair.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.440
That's too much for one house.

11:34.480 --> 11:38.040
And anyway, this year
is meant to be about you and me.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.640
It's just us, and our studies.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.960
And Dexies, apparently.
What?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.640
No, I'll call him. I'll call him.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.280
Oh. Ah. Oh.
(PHONE RINGS)

11:52.320 --> 11:53.720
Oh, here we go.
It's her. It's her.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.920
Here we go.
Yeah, go, go, go.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
Hey, how're you going?

11:57.440 --> 11:59.560
Hey, not bad. How's work?

11:59.600 --> 12:00.000
Yep. Fine.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.120
Yep. Fine.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.440
Cool.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.680
Are you still at my place, or...

12:04.720 --> 12:06.840
No, I'm just out and about.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.840
Oh, have you found a place?
No.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.400
Still working on that.
Oh, OK.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.280
Hey.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.040
Get her out.
And put her on speaker.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.320
Yeah, speaker, speaker.
OK. OK, OK.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.160
Are you on a break?
What?

12:19.200 --> 12:20.440
You can make calls
in the break room,

12:20.480 --> 12:22.000
but you can't be doing it out here.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.600
Hang on.
Do I look like I work here?

12:24.640 --> 12:25.720
Yes.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.200
Fuck. Right. OK.
Thank...thank you.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.320
I don't.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.160
All calls in the break room.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.920
I'm not going to the break room!

12:34.960 --> 12:36.800
Yeah, you...you really should go
to the break room.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.920
It's super unprofessional.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.600
Where is the break room?
Hello, you still there?

12:39.640 --> 12:41.200
Hang on.
You go. You go.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.360
Yeah, sorry. So here's the thing.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.120
I can't look after this dog 24/7
and look for somewhere to live

12:47.160 --> 12:49.320
and do sixth-year medicine,
It's just not possible.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.080
So, you're gonna have to take care
of him

12:52.120 --> 12:54.040
while I find
a more permanent situation.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.480
That's just how it is.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.400
No, Ash. Hard no.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.960
I told you from the get-go
I was in no position

13:00.000 --> 13:02.280
to look after a high-needs dog, OK?

13:02.320 --> 13:06.120
I can't have him here at work.
Plus, I have a date tonight.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.880
That is really not my problem,
Gordon.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.600
And you know what?
It was your destiny to hit this dog.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.200
You would have done it
with or without me.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.440
I'm not part of it.
That's good. That's good.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.400
No, no, don't go hippy-dippy
mid-20s shit on me, Ashley, OK?

13:19.440 --> 13:20.920
This is now a burden,

13:20.960 --> 13:23.040
which is exactly
what you said it wouldn't be.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.880
We made a deal, OK?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.480
I intend on keeping my word.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.640
How about you stand by yours
and look after Colin?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.760
Yeah, I can do that, Gordon,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.120
but not if you're going
to patronise me,

13:35.160 --> 13:36.760
actually,
and not if I have to be out

13:36.800 --> 13:37.880
by fucken sundown.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.200
Do you seriously have nowhere else

13:41.240 --> 13:42.360
that you can stay tonight?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.000
Like nowhere?
No, I do.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.040
I can stay with a friend, I can.
Just not with a high-needs dog.

13:47.080 --> 13:50.080
So, your options are... A.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.920
I stay with Colin in your house,

13:51.960 --> 13:54.360
or B, just Colin stays
in your house.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.440
Your call.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.440
No way!
No! No!

14:00.720 --> 14:04.320
OK. You can stay tonight.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.320
No, no, no,
I will stay a couple more nights,

14:06.360 --> 14:07.800
yeah, without the hassle.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.200
Alright. OK.
You can stay a few more nights.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.120
But I have a date tonight,
and they might come home.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.480
I don't know yet, alright?
So, just know that.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.240
Well done.
Yes, bring them back.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.520
And yes,
I can bring a date home, alright?

14:22.560 --> 14:23.680
It's my house.
Yes.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.800
And I'm single.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.680
OK, mate.
No one's saying you're not.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.080
Good! OK.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.400
Exactly.
See ya.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.480
Bye.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.760
Well, you showed her.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.000
That got so weird. He's weird.
Mm.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.160
You're both weird.
We're both weird.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.520
Girls!

14:41.560 --> 14:43.040
Mum, why are you here?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.840
I've spoken to Erin's mother.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.800
We're having coffee next week,
so...stay tuned.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.280
Anyone hungry?

14:52.320 --> 14:55.320
(SOFT MUSIC)

15:00.960 --> 15:02.800
There's nothing out there.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.560
Share house. Backpackers.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.240
Share house with acting students?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.720
No, Jesus!

15:11.040 --> 15:12.800
Hey, guy.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.440
Hey, boy, hi!

15:14.480 --> 15:15.880
Hi, yeah.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.160
Hey.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.720
All good?
All good.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.320
OK, well,
I'm just in and out anyway, so...

15:29.600 --> 15:30.840
You do you.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.720
OK, so ah, I'm heading off.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.160
Everything OK?
Yeah. Everything good with you?

16:18.200 --> 16:21.040
Yeah, just still looking
for a share house.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.320
OK, cool.
Well, I'll see you later.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.680
Cool. Have fun, Mr Crapp.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.840
Oh, you buried the lead
on that one, didn't ya?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.080
You never asked.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.120
"Everyone calls me Flash."
No wonder.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.280
Your name's Gordon Crapp.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.280
Yeah. Yeah.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.920
Well, now you know. You happy?
Very happy.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.000
OK.
Thank you.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.680
Good. Enjoy. Enjoy, Colin.

16:52.680 --> 16:53.920
Oh...

16:53.960 --> 16:55.760
There's a really good
pizza place on the corner

16:55.800 --> 16:56.960
and I have an account there.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.640
So, if you want,
just call and no problem.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.000
I can say the pizza's
for Crapptain Planet?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.840
I can say the pizza's
for Crapptain Planet?

17:01.880 --> 17:02.880
Yep.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.120
Eric Crappton?
Sure.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.720
Benedict Cumbercrapp.
Get it out of your system.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.319
Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Crapp?

17:09.360 --> 17:11.079
Yep. OK.
I got heaps more.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.440
Do you shop at Crappmandu?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.400
It's actually pronounced Crah-pay.
What?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.760
It's Crah-pay

17:16.800 --> 17:18.599
but my...I think great-grandfather
dropped the e, so...

17:18.640 --> 17:20.640
It's not!
It is.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.240
What's that French for? Turds?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.440
You know what?
Forget the pizza.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.520
No, I want pizza!
I do. Thank you.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.599
You're welcome.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.720
Bye, Mr Crappe.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.800
Pizza time, bitch.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
Are you Gordon?

17:58.440 --> 18:00.000
Belinda?
Yes.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.400
Belinda?
Yes.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.960
Would you like to sit down?
Sure.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.040
Alright.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.080
Evening, folks.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.560
I see you have your drinks already.
Yes. Wonderful.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.840
Have you dined with us before?
No.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.800
OK, well we have the smaller plates
up top there,

18:16.840 --> 18:18.160
medium-sized plates
in the middle.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.040
The larger plates you'll find down
there at the bottom

18:20.080 --> 18:21.560
and the sweet stuff
you'll find on the back.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
Right.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.720
And um, what are the little numbers
next to the meal descriptions?

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
The prices.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.800
Sorry, that was a joke.
I apologise.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.160
Oh.
Sorry.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.600
Well, my name's Dean.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.600
I'll be taking care of you tonight.
OK.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.000
My pronouns are he/his.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.240
Alright. I'll be back in a bit.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.640
See you soon.
Thanks, Dean.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.640
Jeez, how tall's Dean?

18:50.680 --> 18:52.920
His pronouns should be
fee/fi/fo/fum.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.960
No, you can't say that.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.480
I've got trans friends.
Sorry.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.000
That's not cool.
Sorry. No, that was a joke.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.400
That's not cool.
Sorry. No, that was a joke.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.480
I stole it from Twitter,
anyway, so not my joke.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.600
That's a good start.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.080
Sorry for being transphobic
or for stealing jokes?

19:07.120 --> 19:09.000
Mm. For both.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.560
Honestly, for both.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.160
Although, it was more of a tall joke
than a trans joke.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.440
Mm, not really.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.000
Well it was if you think...

19:17.040 --> 19:19.480
Well, you were using trans language
in a joke so it was...

19:19.520 --> 19:20.960
I'm not sure what trans language is.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.800
It's all language.
Well, either way, it's not cool.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.560
Really, well,
it's not cool, I agree.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.720
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.800
God, I hate these things, don't you?

19:40.840 --> 19:42.360
they're so awkward.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.280
Dates?
Eugh! Just the worst.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
They actually are.

19:47.560 --> 19:48.800
Can we just cut
through all the shit?

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
Yeah.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.360
What do you do? What do I do?
Oh, my god.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.480
So contrived.
It really is.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.840
And yet we keep doing them.
No, let's not do that.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.440
Let's not do that.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.000
OK, deal.
Deal.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.120
OK, deal.
Deal.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.000
So, what do you do?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.960
Oh, you're actually asking me.
I run a brewery.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.200
Yeah, I run a brewery. I'm a brewer.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.800
Like beer?
Yeah, beer. Make beer.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
Serve beer. Love beer.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.200
You're not an alcoholic, are you?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.600
Is that a deal breaker?

20:27.640 --> 20:31.200
Well, my dad was a raging alcoholic.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.280
I mean, yeah, isn't everyone's dad?

20:34.720 --> 20:35.840
He died.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.360
Of the alcohol?
And that's a yes.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.800
I'm thinking that's a yes. Sorry.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.360
The shiozake...

20:45.400 --> 20:47.960
I don't know how you pronounce
that, shiozake, is looking good.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.240
I'll give you a minute if you want.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.600
Just here. Just here, mate.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.440
Ooh! Ow! You bit me.
Um, this is actually me. Ah, yeah.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.720
This is me too.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.680
Oh, yeah, I've had a great night
and I've loved all of it.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.200
But um, I'm pretty tired.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.640
So, I've got an early start.
Might just call it.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.960
Well, I'm not calling it.
Oh.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.680
I wanna meet your new
doggy-woggy with the wheels.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.960
Yeah. He's pretty sleepy.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.160
Well, we'll wake him up.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.840
No, no, no,
I've got a really early start.

21:25.880 --> 21:26.880
Honestly, Belinda.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.680
I wake up every day at 6:00.
We can go for a run!

21:37.400 --> 21:39.720
Hey.
Oh, hey.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.080
How was your date?
Um...

21:41.120 --> 21:42.360
She's here!

21:43.440 --> 21:45.160
Oh, hi.
Who's that?

21:45.200 --> 21:48.040
This is, um, this is Ashley.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.760
Ashley's my...

21:49.800 --> 21:51.080
Sister.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.040
Much younger sister.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.440
I was an accident.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.400
Oh! Yes.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.440
I can see it.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.720
Oh, my god. Yeah.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.000
Yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.760
Yeah.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.240
Yeah, cool.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.840
I'm actually just gonna head to bed.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.440
Goodnight!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:05.480 --> 22:06.600
Do you have anything to drink?

22:06.640 --> 22:08.360
I think we're out of drinks,
aren't we?

22:08.400 --> 22:09.720
Out of drinks?

22:09.760 --> 22:12.200
Bro, they're behind you!

22:12.240 --> 22:13.480
Oh!
Silly!

22:13.520 --> 22:14.960
Oh, God, that's right.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Let's make cocktails.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.160
Oh, do you want cocktails?

22:17.200 --> 22:18.760
That seems a lot at this time
of night.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.000
Yeah, have cocktails!

22:20.040 --> 22:21.760
Oh, hey, do you wanna have
a drink with us?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.560
No! I'll leave you to it!

22:24.600 --> 22:26.400
Oh, we haven't caught
up...we haven't caught up at all

22:26.440 --> 22:27.440
since you've been in town.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, we have!
Oh, not really though.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.880
Not really.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.760
Who wants a drink with my sister?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.160
Not me!

22:35.200 --> 22:37.160
OK, I'll have one.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.640
So, then, yeah, he was gone.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.040
So, who was Terry?

22:41.080 --> 22:42.520
Terry?
Who's Terry?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.560
He's our...
He's our eldest brother.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.960
Yeah.
Very old.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.080
Very... He's quite old.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.800
I mean, I haven't seen him
since the sentencing.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.880
What was he...

22:50.920 --> 22:52.120
What'd they fine him for,
in the end?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.920
They got him for like waving it.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.200
Public indecency.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.280
Yeah.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.000
He was...he was always
a troubled kid, in many ways.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.640
He was...he was always
a troubled kid, in many ways.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.400
Yeah, troubled adult.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.520
Can't go near schools anymore.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.160
No, no, no, 'cause he can't...

23:05.200 --> 23:06.840
We don't want him to trouble kids.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.320
Yeah. Anyway...

23:08.360 --> 23:10.960
Anyway.
Did you guys ever...

23:11.000 --> 23:13.040
Do you ever talk about the kiss?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.640
No, no, we...we...

23:14.680 --> 23:16.080
And I don't really want
to talk about it.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.840
I mean, we were pretty drunk
and you know,

23:17.880 --> 23:19.760
it's just brothers being brothers.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.080
Bros be bros, man.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.240
Sometimes, yeah.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.480
Yeah.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.760
So, where'd you guys grow up?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.480
Melbourne.
Adelaide.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.120
Then Adelaide.
Melbourne first, then Adelaide.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.160
Yeah.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.000
But we had to move around
a lot as kids.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.920
A lot.
We had to 'cause of Dad's...

23:35.960 --> 23:37.680
Ankles. (LAUGHS)

23:39.280 --> 23:41.080
They called him Fat Ankle Joe.
Ah.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.880
And they laughed him
out of the Navy,

23:42.920 --> 23:45.400
so we couldn't stay there.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.560
We had to keep moving.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.800
Keep it...keep it light.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.040
Rolling stone.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.120
Yeah.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.960
Well, on that note,
I think I'm gonna head off.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.240
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.200
Can I call you a cab, or...

23:56.240 --> 23:58.280
I ordered an Uber-like
five minutes ago.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.560
Oh.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.000
You just didn't notice
'cause you're in some weird game

24:00.000 --> 24:01.520
You just didn't notice
'cause you're in some weird game

24:01.560 --> 24:03.840
of sexy Family Feud
with your sister.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.360
You two, that's not right.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.240
I've got brothers, but that's off.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.800
I get it, but we've just always
been a close family.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.360
You're a gross family.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.840
Do you even have a crippled dog,

24:15.880 --> 24:17.440
or did you just make that up
to lure me here?

24:17.480 --> 24:18.920
Yeah, we go. He's...

24:18.960 --> 24:20.040
I think he's upstairs.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.640
Oh, and how did he get upstairs
if he's in a wheelchair?

24:23.680 --> 24:24.880
I'm not an idiot!

24:27.440 --> 24:29.280
This is mine now.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.360
Bye!

24:32.080 --> 24:34.480
What?

24:34.520 --> 24:36.600
Did she just rob you?

24:36.640 --> 24:37.880
She just nicked my whisky.

24:37.920 --> 24:41.320
Oh! Boom.
Gone. Sis!

24:41.360 --> 24:42.840
Bro!

24:42.880 --> 24:45.040
My God, what about her?

24:45.080 --> 24:46.120
She crazy.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.640
She hot.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.040
You gonna see her again?
Hopefully.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.160
Yeah, fuck.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
Whoo!

24:54.000 --> 24:56.160
That was fun.
Yeah, wasn't it?

24:56.200 --> 24:59.920
I'm ah, I'm sorry
about that phone call today.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.000
Oh, no, don't be. Don't be.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.160
Oh, no, don't be. Don't be.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.240
It got a bit...
No, I'm sorry.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.720
It was stupid, honestly.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.760
Yeah.

25:04.800 --> 25:10.120
Um, and also, you didn't have
to replace those drawers.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.400
Oh, my god.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.800
I really did, though.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.880
Yeah, you did.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.680
I'm mortified, obviously.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.840
Hey, it's OK. It happens.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.360
Does it?
Does it happen to you?

25:20.400 --> 25:22.840
No, no, no.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.960
Don't laugh.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.320
Sorry, it doesn't.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.400
It's like a new environment,
stress thing.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.640
I'm under a lot of pressure.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.200
It hasn't happened
for a very long time

25:32.240 --> 25:34.240
and it won't happen again, ever.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.960
Don't sweat it. It's OK.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.080
We're golden.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.360
New drawers for me...

25:39.400 --> 25:40.400
Yeah, they're good...

25:40.440 --> 25:41.920
..which is a big plus and...

25:41.960 --> 25:46.040
But if you want, you know,
I do have an ensuite off my bedroom.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.120
Oh.
If you want.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.320
Oh.

25:48.360 --> 25:53.960
Oh, mm, I'm not really there,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.080
if you know what I mean.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.280
No, no, I'm not there either.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.600
No, God no. No, no.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.680
I know you're doing the 30 days
of sexless, aren't you?

25:59.720 --> 26:00.000
So...
Mm-hm.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.720
So...
Mm-hm.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.760
Yeah, no, god no,
I didn't mean that.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.040
I just thought we could swap rooms.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.480
That's all I meant.
Oh!

26:04.520 --> 26:06.080
Yeah.
I really... That's...

26:06.120 --> 26:07.640
I don't need that.
That's very nice, though.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.360
I am very nice.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.600
We're just mates, yeah?

26:11.640 --> 26:13.960
Yeah.
I mean, we're not really mates.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.040
Why? Why aren't we mates?

26:17.080 --> 26:20.480
Well, I mean,
we...we can try to be mates.

26:20.520 --> 26:25.120
But I mean, currently,
I've seen your nipple.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.840
So, we can't be mates
because you've seen my nipple?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.120
Don't you agree?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.840
I mean, I'm not trying to be a dick
or anything,

26:31.880 --> 26:34.400
but isn't that a thing
that we're both aware of?

26:34.440 --> 26:36.480
I'm not aware of it.
I see nipples every day.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.560
Well, I don't see nipples every day,
and they mean something to me.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.640
And I'm just saying...

26:41.680 --> 26:42.920
You're just saying
that we cannot be mates.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
Well...

26:44.000 --> 26:45.040
That's insane.
Well I'm not...

26:45.080 --> 26:46.960
I don't mean to be all
'When Harry Met Sally' about it...

26:47.000 --> 26:48.680
Who are they?
Are they friends of yours?

26:48.720 --> 26:50.480
No, 'When Harry Met Sally'.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.240
Women and men can't be friends.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.480
I'll have what she's having.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.920
What are we having?

26:55.960 --> 26:57.920
How old are... Doesn't matter.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.000
How's about you show me your nipple
and then we're even?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.200
How's about you show me your nipple
and then we're even?

27:03.680 --> 27:05.120
OK, yeah.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.880
Alright, let's do that.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.160
Then we're even.
Even.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.440
OK, you be in your car.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.360
I'm not being in the car.
Be in the car.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.280
Here?
Yeah.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.800
Be in your cool vintage hipster car,
and I'll just be walking along.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.000
Ready?

27:18.040 --> 27:19.240
I don't walk like that.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.520
There you go.
That's bullshit.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.880
Ready? Ready?
I don't look like that.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.600
Great. Awesome.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.120
And I didn't hit a dog.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.440
That's a win.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.800
Was that nice?
That was nice.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.360
Feel quite liberated.
Do you wanna see the other one?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
No, I don't.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.480
I wanna get em out all the time now.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.200
Don't.
OK.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.280
Straight to the wank bank.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.080
Really?
Fuck no.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.480
It was like an old man's nipple.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.960
Like cabanossi.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.600
OK.
Goodnight, weird mate.
See ya.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.680
Where are you going?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.360
Oh, sorry.
No, we can't walk off together.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.440
No.
You go.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.840
Just don't follow me to bed.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.920
I'll clean up.
Yep.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.960
I'll see you in a couple of hours
when you need to do a wee.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.080
Don't!

27:57.120 --> 27:58.280
Too soon?

27:58.320 --> 27:59.720
Way too soon.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.000
Sorry.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.840
Sorry.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.040
Night, weird mate.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.120
Yes!

28:06.320 --> 28:09.320
