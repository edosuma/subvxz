02:08.500 --> 02:09.901
David, is that you?

02:19.220 --> 02:21.488
You'll never guess what I found.
Can you believe it?

02:21.788 --> 02:23.472
-We need to go.
-Did you see something?

02:23.572 --> 02:25.180
-I heard something.
-We stayed too long.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.288
Come on.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.265
Come on.

02:50.477 --> 02:51.970
We need to keep moving.

03:08.879 --> 03:10.768
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

03:12.143 --> 03:13.492
You gotta go without me.

03:13.592 --> 03:16.038
-I'm not leaving you.
-Trust me.

03:16.438 --> 03:17.944
I'll be home before dinner.

03:19.628 --> 03:22.009
-No, you should keep the gun.
-I'll manage.

03:22.109 --> 03:24.851
Go. Mom can't be alone.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.682
I love you.

03:35.688 --> 03:37.864
I love you, too.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.452
Where's your brother?

04:46.889 --> 04:50.054
He caught a deer trail
on the way back.

04:50.154 --> 04:53.157
Said he was gonna try
and bag it.

04:54.723 --> 04:56.073
He's a good boy.

04:58.379 --> 04:59.977
You two need to stick together
after I--

05:00.077 --> 05:01.456
I don't want to talk about that.

05:01.556 --> 05:02.818
Anna, I...

05:07.084 --> 05:09.042
You don't have to be afraid of me.

05:12.350 --> 05:14.743
Did you find anything else?
Any books?

05:24.231 --> 05:25.972
Put it up with the others.

05:35.938 --> 05:38.637
I regret never taking you and your brother
to see the ocean.

05:38.737 --> 05:40.030
It's not your fault.

05:40.230 --> 05:42.249
Doesn't stop me from wishing.

05:44.817 --> 05:48.038
What's the point in wishing
for something that can never be?

05:49.822 --> 05:53.726
Anna, if we don't have hope,

05:53.826 --> 05:56.002
what's the point of living?

06:35.563 --> 06:38.901
It's not like David
to be out after dark.

06:39.001 --> 06:41.134
I'm sure he'll be home soon.

06:46.183 --> 06:49.173
There's no sense in pretending
this isn't happening.

06:49.273 --> 06:52.567
You don't know what the future holds.
You might--

06:52.667 --> 06:56.745
Let me finish.
I want you...

06:56.845 --> 06:59.096
and your brother...

06:59.196 --> 07:04.449
to find people worth sharing life with.

07:04.549 --> 07:09.367
And maybe find that city by the sea.

07:09.467 --> 07:12.457
Haven's just a myth, Mom.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.036
Maybe.

07:17.388 --> 07:22.119
I'd like it if you'd take me up
to see the sunrise tomorrow.

07:22.219 --> 07:24.643
You know I can't do that.

07:24.743 --> 07:26.788
Honey, I'm not changing.

07:30.096 --> 07:31.619
Just dying.

12:31.571 --> 12:32.746
I'm not sick.

12:34.139 --> 12:36.476
What do you want?

12:36.576 --> 12:37.869
Same as you.

12:37.969 --> 12:40.262
Clean water.
Maybe catch a fish.

12:40.362 --> 12:42.177
I didn't expect to meet anyone.

12:42.277 --> 12:43.918
Then why did you follow me?

12:44.018 --> 12:45.803
People need to stick together.

12:53.158 --> 12:55.073
Throw your gun over the fence.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.019
I can't have you take my weapon.

12:58.119 --> 13:00.600
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in you.

13:25.799 --> 13:28.136
Do you have any more weapons?

13:28.236 --> 13:30.369
Pistol, knife?

13:49.431 --> 13:52.522
My name's Peter.

13:54.175 --> 13:55.990
I'm Anna.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.776
Pleased to meet you, Anna.

13:58.876 --> 14:01.879
So, now what?

14:07.319 --> 14:10.222
So you get many visitors
around these parts?

14:10.322 --> 14:13.878
A trader here and there.
Some kind.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.109
Some not.

14:18.678 --> 14:21.899
Well it's-- It's not a bad
set-up you've got here.

14:24.205 --> 14:25.933
It's home.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.631
Saw the furnace and the anvil,

14:27.731 --> 14:29.894
you got somebody here
that knows how to use them?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.157
My entire family knows
how to work metal.

14:32.257 --> 14:34.128
Ah. Impressive.

14:37.175 --> 14:38.642
Well, it's dark.

14:38.742 --> 14:40.744
You must be expecting
your people back soon.

14:43.747 --> 14:45.879
Soon enough.

14:50.492 --> 14:52.786
So you're a believer then.

14:52.886 --> 14:54.309
My mom taught me the Bible.

14:54.409 --> 14:57.195
It's the best thing in these times.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.623
I belong to a community.

15:03.723 --> 15:06.278
Faithful. Good people.

15:06.378 --> 15:07.888
I mean we're a fair distance
from here,

15:07.988 --> 15:10.338
but it's-- it's nice.

15:11.949 --> 15:15.679
We got a little lake,
clean water, food.

15:15.779 --> 15:17.476
We're building a life.

15:19.913 --> 15:21.728
My mom used to tell stories like that

15:21.828 --> 15:24.426
about a settlement by the sea.

15:24.526 --> 15:26.659
Used to tell?

15:30.358 --> 15:33.579
Are they all dead?

15:39.367 --> 15:43.589
It's all right.
I understand why you'd lie.

15:46.853 --> 15:49.334
Your mother sounds like
a very smart lady.

15:51.379 --> 15:53.207
She was the best of us.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.939
You know sometimes
good people die

15:59.039 --> 16:00.345
and the wicked live.

16:04.871 --> 16:08.383
It's late.
You should get some rest.

16:08.483 --> 16:10.603
It's a long walk to my village.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.866
Who said I'm coming with you?

16:12.966 --> 16:17.262
Well, it's your choice.
But we could use a metal worker.

16:17.362 --> 16:20.961
And you'd be safer there
with us.

16:21.061 --> 16:23.137
I can take care of myself.

16:23.237 --> 16:24.661
I don't doubt it.

16:24.761 --> 16:26.458
But no one should be alone.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.543
You mind if I--
You mind if I sleep here?

16:37.643 --> 16:39.937
I'd rather you slept
outside the fence.

16:40.037 --> 16:41.895
You don't trust easily, do you?

16:41.995 --> 16:44.215
Trust is earned.

16:45.390 --> 16:47.131
Yeah, you're right.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.003
And think about my offer.

17:11.808 --> 17:14.798
How old are you?

17:14.897 --> 17:15.898
Nineteen.

17:18.465 --> 17:20.859
So you've never known
any different.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.433
Did you bury your mother nearby?

17:30.261 --> 17:31.262
Of course.

17:33.830 --> 17:34.961
Up that hill.

17:38.835 --> 17:40.532
She always liked the view.

17:45.624 --> 17:49.049
If you think it appropriate,
I'm...

17:49.149 --> 17:51.717
I'd really like to say
a few words for her.

17:55.416 --> 17:57.157
She would've really liked that.

17:58.942 --> 18:02.019
Lord, bless these two.

18:02.119 --> 18:05.892
Keep their souls.

18:05.992 --> 18:09.983
For we will join them one day,
in your ever-loving Mercy.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.476
Amen.

18:12.694 --> 18:13.957
Amen.

18:26.143 --> 18:27.871
I tried to do that so many times,

18:27.971 --> 18:30.264
but I could never find the words.

18:30.364 --> 18:33.846
Blessed are those who mourn.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.493
That belonged to my brother.

18:41.593 --> 18:44.770
The living need this
more than the dead.

18:46.032 --> 18:47.120
Here.

18:59.698 --> 19:01.178
You kept it loaded.

19:02.832 --> 19:04.355
Guess you earned some trust
after all.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.131
Well, I'll be following that ridge

19:11.231 --> 19:13.146
up there for a few days.

19:17.150 --> 19:18.412
Thank you.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.002
You want some help with that?

21:23.102 --> 21:25.918
No.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.151
Well, it looks like you brought
half your cabin with you.

21:30.153 --> 21:33.186
Would've brought more
if I could.

21:33.286 --> 21:35.797
Hated leaving all mom's books.

21:35.897 --> 21:38.944
Don't worry, we've got a few
of our own back in the village.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.979
It's real nice what you did,

21:43.079 --> 21:45.198
burying your people back there.

21:45.298 --> 21:47.300
Lot of folks don't do that anymore.

21:49.346 --> 21:51.857
I couldn't find David's body.

21:51.957 --> 21:54.655
The Lord doesn't need
his body to keep his soul.

22:17.287 --> 22:18.853
Get down.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.088
Come.

22:53.845 --> 22:56.922
I've never been that close
to one before.

22:57.022 --> 22:58.750
Even the Changed
that killed my brother.

22:58.850 --> 23:00.199
They're not Changed.

23:01.853 --> 23:03.059
Then what are they?

23:03.159 --> 23:04.712
They're men.

23:04.812 --> 23:06.584
We call them the Berserkers.

23:06.684 --> 23:09.239
Strange to see them this far
out of the city, though.

23:09.339 --> 23:11.241
So they're pretending?

23:11.341 --> 23:14.331
They worship the legend
of The Changing.

23:14.431 --> 23:17.334
If they could,
I'm sure they'd infect themselves.

23:17.434 --> 23:18.957
We need to keep moving.

23:26.182 --> 23:28.662
Do you remember anything
about the old world?

23:29.924 --> 23:31.143
I was young...

23:33.276 --> 23:34.581
8 or 9.

23:37.193 --> 23:39.921
What I have are just flashes.

23:40.021 --> 23:44.143
Don't know
whether they're true or...

23:44.243 --> 23:46.680
just things
I made up after the fact.

23:49.248 --> 23:52.238
My parents were professors
at a university.

23:52.338 --> 23:55.733
And they came out
to the woods to study...

23:57.430 --> 23:58.723
primitive survival.

24:00.259 --> 24:03.206
My mom was pregnant with
my brother at the time.

24:03.306 --> 24:06.309
She said she wanted to do it
without modern medicine.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.097
She used to tell me all of her friends
thought she had a screw loose.

24:15.535 --> 24:16.971
What happened to your dad?

24:20.758 --> 24:22.747
They raised my brother.

24:22.847 --> 24:24.196
Had me.

24:28.505 --> 24:30.146
But my dad got sick.

24:30.246 --> 24:34.424
Happened on a run to the city.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.286
I was only a baby,
but my mom said

24:40.386 --> 24:41.996
that he turned into something that...

24:44.173 --> 24:46.118
wasn't human anymore.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.046
A wild man.

24:51.528 --> 24:53.878
And she killed him to protect us.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.935
My, uh, parents, they...

25:11.200 --> 25:13.811
they brought me
into these woods to survive.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.640
But they were stubborn.

25:19.033 --> 25:21.079
Wanted to take back
what was ours.

25:22.428 --> 25:25.897
So they left me
here with my grandpa

25:25.997 --> 25:27.390
and never came back.

25:29.174 --> 25:31.772
By then the sickness
was under control,

25:31.872 --> 25:34.775
the monsters slain.

25:34.875 --> 25:38.401
But people become
their own kind of monster.

25:41.621 --> 25:43.623
Do you think
the Berserkers killed them?

25:46.365 --> 25:47.888
That or...

25:52.197 --> 25:53.751
maybe they just thought
they'd be better off

25:53.851 --> 25:55.809
without a kid to tie them down.

26:01.554 --> 26:03.295
Don't ever think like that.

26:54.085 --> 26:56.161
Aah! Aah!

26:56.261 --> 26:57.306
Peter!

27:17.238 --> 27:18.662
Berserkers?

27:18.762 --> 27:20.490
No, it's not their style.

27:20.590 --> 27:23.070
I'd say it's another faction
staking their claim.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.756
Can you walk?

27:25.856 --> 27:28.976
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

27:29.076 --> 27:31.065
Okay. Okay.

27:56.234 --> 27:57.714
Give me some help, please.

28:30.616 --> 28:31.822
I'm going to look around.

28:31.922 --> 28:34.085
See what else I can find.

28:34.185 --> 28:36.448
Well, don't wander off
too far, Anna.

30:10.281 --> 30:11.748
Where are you going?

30:11.848 --> 30:13.837
You weren't there
when I woke. I thought--

30:13.937 --> 30:15.186
I'm all-- I'm all right.

30:15.286 --> 30:17.506
Come on. I found something.

30:28.038 --> 30:30.201
I saw the smoke
this morning.

30:30.301 --> 30:31.724
Is it one of them?

30:31.824 --> 30:33.291
A Berserker?

30:33.391 --> 30:35.902
No.
It's just an old man.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.122
Should we go down there?

30:38.222 --> 30:39.732
Well, we don't know
if we can trust him.

30:39.832 --> 30:41.647
For all we know,
he set that trap.

30:41.747 --> 30:43.780
I thought you said people
need to stick together.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.229
Yeah, good people do.

30:47.492 --> 30:49.176
We'll double back,
grab our packs,

30:49.276 --> 30:50.713
and then we'll give him
a wide berth.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.851
Hey! Up here.

31:00.113 --> 31:01.201
We're not sick.

31:02.899 --> 31:04.204
Come on down.

31:18.697 --> 31:21.260
I was wondering when you were going
to make yourselves known.

31:21.660 --> 31:23.528
You knew where we were?

31:24.790 --> 31:26.387
It's not too smart

31:26.487 --> 31:28.968
lighting fires in the day
for all to see.

31:30.535 --> 31:33.573
Unless you want
to be found, that is.

31:33.973 --> 31:36.223
Good you all decided
to play nice.

31:36.323 --> 31:40.576
Was about to put a bullet
between your eyes.

31:40.676 --> 31:43.026
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

31:44.854 --> 31:46.582
Good job, son.

31:46.682 --> 31:50.107
Now why don't you two
put your guns down,

31:50.207 --> 31:52.383
and we can all be civilized?

32:04.917 --> 32:06.223
Darling, your knife.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.319
Down. Down.

32:19.105 --> 32:24.184
Sorry for the, uh, theatrics.

32:24.284 --> 32:26.535
Never can be too careful.

32:26.635 --> 32:29.538
No. You can't.

32:29.638 --> 32:31.191
Sit down.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.410
Join us.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.251
Please.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.293
What are you all doing
in these parts?

32:46.393 --> 32:49.514
We're making our way
back to my people.

32:49.614 --> 32:51.647
What people would those be?

32:51.747 --> 32:54.606
There's a community
that we're part of.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.970
Community.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.438
Not too many fit that
description anymore.

33:00.538 --> 33:03.367
You mean those religious folks
down by the lake?

33:07.545 --> 33:08.851
That's right.

33:11.201 --> 33:13.682
And you're both welcome to join
if you'd like.

33:15.553 --> 33:17.498
I think you'd better ask your man

33:17.598 --> 33:19.500
before you start
handing out invitations.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.546
He's not my man.

33:21.646 --> 33:23.679
You traveling with him
by your own accord?

33:23.779 --> 33:24.723
Of course she is.

33:24.823 --> 33:27.739
I did not ask you.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.472
I make my own choices.

33:34.572 --> 33:38.824
We've had a few encounters
with your community.

33:38.924 --> 33:41.348
Funny,
I don't recognize you.

33:41.448 --> 33:45.265
Well, it was a long time ago.

33:45.365 --> 33:47.180
Dealt mostly with Judith,

33:47.280 --> 33:49.879
sometimes with Zack.

33:49.979 --> 33:52.751
We weren't always
just two, neither.

33:52.851 --> 33:55.201
No, we weren't.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.758
Look, we're just
passing through.

33:59.858 --> 34:03.370
You see, now, that--
that there is the problem.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.243
You didn't ask
our permission.

34:06.343 --> 34:08.518
Well, I'm asking now.

34:14.090 --> 34:15.134
We'll allow it.

34:17.310 --> 34:21.388
But the toll...
is your packs.

34:21.487 --> 34:24.435
Looked like you had
some decent tools.

34:24.534 --> 34:27.103
And that tarp of yours.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.092
All right.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.920
That settles him.

34:32.021 --> 34:34.184
But what about the girl?

34:34.284 --> 34:35.676
What about me?

34:37.112 --> 34:40.320
Well,
this community of his

34:40.420 --> 34:42.553
took a lot from us.

34:44.337 --> 34:45.643
A lot.

34:46.905 --> 34:49.721
Figure we need
to take something back.

34:49.821 --> 34:50.940
Over my dead body.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.290
That won't be hard to arrange.

34:53.389 --> 34:55.639
You can keep the packs,
but she's coming with me.

34:55.739 --> 34:58.295
You talk like you've got
some choice in the matter.

34:58.395 --> 35:00.645
Why don't we let
the girl decide?

35:00.745 --> 35:03.169
She makes her own choices.
Remember?

35:03.269 --> 35:05.271
That's right, son.

35:06.490 --> 35:09.132
Where are our manners?

35:09.232 --> 35:12.135
So what about it,
little missy?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.802
You want to stay with us?

35:22.332 --> 35:24.451
I'll stay...

35:24.551 --> 35:26.945
if you promise that no harm
will come to Peter.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.342
I'll honor that.

35:34.039 --> 35:36.259
Peter, you're free to go.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.427
Oh no. We'll be keeping
your shotgun, though.

35:43.527 --> 35:45.472
Let's go. Come on.

35:45.572 --> 35:48.662
We don't need any more
of your crazy in our lives.

35:52.552 --> 35:53.829
Please, don't hurt him.

35:53.929 --> 35:55.091
All right.

35:55.491 --> 35:57.019
Son of a bitch!

36:05.941 --> 36:07.420
They would have killed me...

36:09.335 --> 36:11.555
and done God knows what
to you.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.940
If you'd listened to me
in the first place,

36:18.040 --> 36:19.376
none of this
would have happened.

36:19.476 --> 36:21.552
I tried to do
what I thought was right.

36:21.652 --> 36:23.641
I'm the one who decides
who joins our community,

36:23.741 --> 36:26.265
not you! Not you!

36:31.967 --> 36:33.751
All right. I forgive you.

36:36.188 --> 36:37.407
Come on.

36:41.019 --> 36:42.107
Look.

36:44.544 --> 36:46.359
I just have your best
interests at heart.

36:46.459 --> 36:47.808
Okay?

36:49.506 --> 36:50.506
All right?

37:30.199 --> 37:32.331
You still searching
for that other world?

37:39.860 --> 37:41.645
Have you ever seen the ocean?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.693
When I was little,
before all this.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.480
The ocean used to mean
safety in my house.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.006
I once met a man who claimed
to come from Haven.

37:57.617 --> 37:58.997
Really?

38:03.014 --> 38:04.785
I thought that was
something my mom made up.

38:04.885 --> 38:07.062
It may not be real,
but she didn't make it up.

38:10.195 --> 38:14.012
It's an old legend
from the time of the Changing.

38:14.112 --> 38:17.581
A place apparently free of disease.

38:17.681 --> 38:19.944
Have you ever thought
about trying to find it?

38:21.467 --> 38:22.542
Lots of times.

38:22.642 --> 38:24.283
What stopped you?

38:24.383 --> 38:27.112
Life. People I'm with now.

38:27.212 --> 38:29.506
I think my calling
is to help them.

38:29.606 --> 38:30.999
Then what are you
doing out here?

38:35.873 --> 38:37.831
I'm the preacher
in my village.

38:39.398 --> 38:40.604
I came out here

38:40.704 --> 38:44.795
to find people
worthy to join our flock.

38:46.405 --> 38:48.016
So that's why you came
after me.

38:51.976 --> 38:55.458
It might be real,
but it's still just a place.

38:56.763 --> 39:01.420
People are what make
something special.

39:12.388 --> 39:14.955
We should sleep
under the stars tonight.

39:46.987 --> 39:48.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.816
There's no need
for that.

39:54.734 --> 39:57.028
- Hi.
- Peter.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.162
Oh, my God.

40:00.262 --> 40:01.859
What's happened to you?

40:01.959 --> 40:04.253
Oh, I'm fine.

40:04.353 --> 40:06.690
It's good to see you, Judith.

40:06.790 --> 40:08.735
This is, uh, my friend Anna.

40:08.835 --> 40:11.521
We'll have time for pleasantries later.

40:11.621 --> 40:14.089
We shouldn't linger.
Zack will want to see you straightaway.

40:14.189 --> 40:15.220
Has something happened?

40:15.320 --> 40:17.105
I'll let him tell you.
Come.

40:45.263 --> 40:47.122
You look like hell.

40:47.222 --> 40:49.428
Yeah. You should see
the other guy.

40:49.528 --> 40:51.169
You know the drill--

40:51.269 --> 40:52.953
weapons and packs surrendered
before you can enter.

40:53.053 --> 40:54.781
Jesus. Well,

40:54.881 --> 40:56.218
haven't seen one
of these in ages.

40:56.318 --> 40:57.567
Where'd you find it?

40:57.667 --> 40:59.264
Watch the language,
Ben.

40:59.364 --> 41:02.006
Ran into a couple men
in the woods on the way back.

41:02.106 --> 41:03.616
Didn't end well.

41:03.716 --> 41:05.096
You'd think,
after all these years,

41:05.196 --> 41:06.458
you'd learn to get along.

41:07.807 --> 41:10.232
See you found someone
to join our ranks.

41:10.332 --> 41:11.537
Did you doubt me?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.856
I know better than that.

41:14.249 --> 41:15.672
Name's Ben.

41:15.772 --> 41:17.152
Anna.

41:17.252 --> 41:18.252
Pleasure.

41:22.039 --> 41:23.214
Your knife, too.

41:24.781 --> 41:26.161
I'd rather keep that.

41:26.261 --> 41:27.814
If you want to join our village,

41:27.914 --> 41:29.438
you have to obey our rules.

41:43.582 --> 41:44.757
Welcome home.

42:04.951 --> 42:06.897
We'd begun to fear
the worst, brother.

42:06.997 --> 42:09.291
It was tougher than expected.

42:09.391 --> 42:11.423
Not many people left
up in the mountains.

42:11.523 --> 42:14.296
Well, it looks to me that your
journey was worth the trouble.

42:14.396 --> 42:17.081
Everybody, this is Anna.

42:17.181 --> 42:18.474
She's a true believer.

42:18.574 --> 42:21.259
She survived the pestilence
with resilience.

42:21.359 --> 42:24.219
Tragedy struck her family
a month ago,

42:24.319 --> 42:27.844
so I've offered her
a place here with us.

42:30.150 --> 42:32.270
Welcome, Anna.
My name is Zack.

42:32.370 --> 42:34.185
I'm the founder
of the settlement.

42:34.285 --> 42:35.230
Thank you for taking me in.

42:35.330 --> 42:36.796
We should celebrate.

42:36.896 --> 42:40.713
But first there is more
urgent business to attend to.

42:40.813 --> 42:42.498
What business?

42:42.598 --> 42:44.643
We've had an unwelcome guest.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.948
This is elder business.

42:58.048 --> 43:00.646
No, no, no, no.
She's tied to me now.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.735
Tomorrow we welcome her
into the fold,

43:02.835 --> 43:05.216
but for today she
should see what I see,

43:05.316 --> 43:07.318
just like you see for Zack.

43:10.016 --> 43:11.191
Fine.

43:27.947 --> 43:31.168
Hey! Stand up so we can
get a look at you.

43:36.652 --> 43:38.684
Damn thing sold his soul.

43:38.784 --> 43:41.034
I haven't been able
to get a word out of him.

43:41.134 --> 43:42.788
It's all he does is whistle.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.302
You mean he just
wandered into the camp?

43:47.402 --> 43:49.913
Found him out there
by the old mill.

43:50.013 --> 43:52.089
That's 15 miles away.

43:52.189 --> 43:53.308
You should have
left him there.

43:53.408 --> 43:54.352
I wanted to.

43:54.452 --> 43:55.440
They're encroaching
on our land.

43:55.540 --> 43:57.268
It's time we start
fighting back.

43:57.368 --> 43:59.749
Fight. It's hard enough
to defend this place,

43:59.849 --> 44:01.098
let alone start a war.

44:01.198 --> 44:02.578
Berserkers are just as bad

44:02.678 --> 44:03.666
as the pestilence.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.015
You wouldn't say that

44:05.115 --> 44:06.190
if you'd seen someone change.

44:06.290 --> 44:07.452
You know what I saw.

44:07.552 --> 44:08.801
I fought in the war.

44:08.901 --> 44:10.673
I watched good men
and women get bit

44:10.773 --> 44:13.763
by things that weren't
human anymore.

44:13.863 --> 44:17.245
You wouldn't
believe the screams.

44:17.345 --> 44:20.739
Eventually their...
soul just slips out of them.

44:23.089 --> 44:24.426
They aren't really dead,
are they?

44:24.526 --> 44:26.645
All the more reason
we should cleanse this land

44:26.745 --> 44:27.907
once and for all.

44:28.007 --> 44:30.214
Berserkers are men.

44:30.314 --> 44:32.695
Men can be reasoned with.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.275
Does that look like a man to you?

44:38.409 --> 44:40.529
God will provide.

44:40.629 --> 44:43.196
I've waited for you
to pass final judgment.

45:20.277 --> 45:21.787
This is all yours?

45:21.887 --> 45:24.412
Well, being an Elder
has its perks.

45:32.202 --> 45:34.409
What did you mean by
I'm tied to you?

45:34.509 --> 45:36.585
Well, I'm your sponsor
into this village.

45:36.685 --> 45:38.730
It's tradition.

45:41.603 --> 45:45.507
Peter, I really appreciate
everything that you've done here

45:45.607 --> 45:49.045
but I don't want you getting
the wrong impression.

45:50.873 --> 45:56.213
You are exactly the woman
I thought you'd be.

45:56.313 --> 45:58.881
Anna, don't be afraid.

46:10.196 --> 46:12.969
Do you think it's a good idea
keeping that Berserker here?

46:13.069 --> 46:14.362
Well, we'll pass judgment.

46:14.462 --> 46:16.581
Either way, he won't
be here long.

46:16.681 --> 46:18.104
What does that mean?

46:18.204 --> 46:19.410
He'll be released
if he's innocent.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.238
And if he's guilty,

46:21.338 --> 46:23.458
he'll be held accountable
for his sins.

46:23.558 --> 46:27.387
There's no room in
the world for the wicked.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.436
Hey, don't you
worry about it.

46:34.394 --> 46:36.135
The Lord will provide.

46:38.703 --> 46:41.214
But you should rest up.

46:41.314 --> 46:43.173
There's going to be
a big celebration tonight

46:43.273 --> 46:44.957
in honor of your arrival.

46:45.057 --> 46:47.699
I imagine that we'll--
we'll open some of Ben's wine.

46:47.799 --> 46:49.397
It's uh, it's not bad.

46:49.497 --> 46:50.833
It's...
it's a little bitter

46:50.933 --> 46:52.195
but I think you'll like it.

46:55.198 --> 46:56.939
What if I don't
want to stay?

47:00.072 --> 47:02.453
The Lord is
calling you, Anna.

47:02.553 --> 47:03.846
It's not for us
to decide whether

47:03.946 --> 47:05.556
what He asks
is right or wrong.

47:07.906 --> 47:10.561
I have to go discuss the
prisoner with Ben and Zack.

47:13.042 --> 47:15.205
Well this, this
meeting isn't for you.

47:15.305 --> 47:16.685
It's probably best
if you stay in the room

47:16.785 --> 47:18.438
until the others trust you.

47:31.408 --> 47:33.397
That rifle you brought
back was impressive.

47:33.497 --> 47:34.703
It's military issue.

47:34.803 --> 47:37.053
Haven't seen one of
those since the war.

47:37.153 --> 47:38.837
You're lucky to be
alive running into that.

47:38.937 --> 47:41.100
Well, luck had nothing
to do with it.

47:41.200 --> 47:42.711
God's on our side, Ben.

47:42.811 --> 47:43.842
I wouldn't be surprised if

47:43.942 --> 47:45.714
we could push
the Berserkers back.

47:45.814 --> 47:48.760
Maybe even, maybe even gain a
little territory near the city.

47:48.860 --> 47:50.936
Think you've been in those
mountains too long, Peter.

47:51.036 --> 47:52.547
You're starting to sound like Zack.

47:52.647 --> 47:54.692
Well, maybe we need a little
more of that around here.

47:56.302 --> 47:57.726
Look around you.

47:57.826 --> 48:00.685
These people rely on us
to keep them safe.

48:00.785 --> 48:02.513
You worry about protecting us.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.702
I'll worry about inspiring greatness.

48:36.081 --> 48:40.551
I call this meeting of the
Trinity of Elders into session.

48:40.651 --> 48:43.336
All decisions shall be binding.

48:43.436 --> 48:44.686
And so it shall be.

48:44.786 --> 48:47.123
- So it shall be.
- So it shall be.

48:47.223 --> 48:51.475
Peter, I have voted death
for our prisoner.

48:51.575 --> 48:53.390
Ben thinks we should
trade him back

48:53.490 --> 48:55.610
to the Berserkers for protection.

48:55.710 --> 48:58.103
The tie goes to you.

49:02.020 --> 49:05.750
I'm concerned his presence may
bring harm to our community.

49:05.850 --> 49:07.665
I knew you would
see reason, Peter.

49:07.765 --> 49:09.928
I can lead a small party
to make contact right away.

49:10.028 --> 49:11.016
If we hurry--

49:11.116 --> 49:12.596
I'm not finished.

49:15.164 --> 49:17.893
We'll proceed with summary judgment
and execution tomorrow.

49:17.993 --> 49:19.677
God be praised.

49:19.777 --> 49:21.170
You've made the right choice, Peter.

49:59.643 --> 50:02.298
Peter asked me to bring
you to the celebration.

50:07.042 --> 50:08.585
Moby Dick.

50:10.785 --> 50:12.656
I haven't read this
since I was a kid.

50:15.311 --> 50:17.256
It's a bit of a family heirloom.

50:17.356 --> 50:20.564
Well, the Good Book's
all we really need.

50:20.664 --> 50:23.959
If that's true, then why does
Peter have all these books?

50:24.059 --> 50:27.919
You are a brave one.
Surviving all alone.

50:28.019 --> 50:31.662
And now you have Peter.

50:31.762 --> 50:33.664
You must have made
quite an impression

50:33.764 --> 50:35.535
for him to sponsor you.

50:35.635 --> 50:37.725
Peter's been kind.
There's no doubt.

50:40.205 --> 50:42.673
What happened out
there with those men?

50:42.773 --> 50:44.022
What do you mean?

50:44.122 --> 50:45.328
Peter won't tell me.

50:45.428 --> 50:47.547
He usually tells
me everything.

50:47.647 --> 50:50.942
Peter did what
he thought was necessary.

50:51.042 --> 50:52.174
Sounds like
you don't agree.

50:54.916 --> 50:58.820
Those men said that
they knew you and Zack.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.735
Didn't sound like they
cherished the memory.

51:00.835 --> 51:02.880
And you believed them?

51:07.667 --> 51:10.048
Just so we're clear.

51:10.148 --> 51:12.660
This is my village.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.066
And Peter was mine first.

51:18.287 --> 51:20.755
You found us a worthy one, Peter.

51:20.855 --> 51:22.800
I simply showed her the path.

51:22.900 --> 51:25.673
She had to walk down it.

51:25.773 --> 51:28.893
You know when his Grandfather
and I met, he was only...

51:28.993 --> 51:29.894
What was it?

51:29.994 --> 51:31.809
Twelve, Peter?

51:31.909 --> 51:34.203
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.

51:34.303 --> 51:37.075
But already he had the blessings

51:37.175 --> 51:41.950
of the Holy Spirit
running through his veins.

51:42.050 --> 51:44.213
Without him, Judith
and I never could've

51:44.313 --> 51:46.824
created this
beautiful sanctuary.

51:46.924 --> 51:49.479
You give me
too much credit, Brother.

51:50.798 --> 51:52.961
Humble to the end.

51:53.061 --> 51:56.442
I'd like to welcome Anna
properly tomorrow morning.

51:56.542 --> 51:59.110
Yes, there's no time to waste.

52:00.895 --> 52:01.839
What's involved?

52:01.939 --> 52:04.407
Just a prayer and a baptism.

52:04.507 --> 52:06.975
Oh, my mother baptized me
when I was a baby.

52:07.075 --> 52:08.672
Of course she did.

52:08.772 --> 52:10.761
Her mother was a good
and God-fearing woman.

52:10.861 --> 52:14.591
Yes, and I see that
reflected in the daughter.

52:14.691 --> 52:17.812
But we follow
the new teachings here, Anna.

52:17.912 --> 52:20.915
A second baptism is our way.

52:22.525 --> 52:24.557
This place is of the clean.

52:24.657 --> 52:26.429
Your Original Sin may
have been washed away

52:26.529 --> 52:30.912
but now the sin of
the plague must be destroyed.

52:31.012 --> 52:32.783
Wiped away from us all.

52:32.883 --> 52:34.567
It's God's will.

52:34.667 --> 52:37.788
For I will restore
your health to you.

52:37.888 --> 52:40.965
And I will heal you of
your wounds, said the Lord.

52:41.065 --> 52:45.622
Because they called you
an outcast, saying:

52:45.722 --> 52:49.987
This is Zion, whom no man
shall seek after.

52:51.554 --> 52:52.803
- Amen.
- Amen

52:52.903 --> 52:54.122
Amen.

52:56.646 --> 52:57.865
Amen.

52:59.344 --> 53:00.693
Excuse me.

53:04.959 --> 53:07.557
She has a fire burning inside her.

53:07.657 --> 53:10.125
Yes.

53:10.225 --> 53:12.140
Good job, Peter.

53:32.812 --> 53:35.063
How do you reconcile
this second baptism

53:35.163 --> 53:36.904
with the scripture
you're so fond of quoting?

53:39.645 --> 53:41.939
Bible is a blessed book but it's...

53:42.039 --> 53:45.638
it's been adapted
over the years, too.

53:45.738 --> 53:48.903
The New Testament, Old.

53:49.003 --> 53:54.996
The world has changed a lot
over the past few decades.

53:55.096 --> 53:57.750
And we are following
the newer teachings of God.

53:58.969 --> 54:00.915
And who speaks for God?

54:01.015 --> 54:02.190
You?

54:05.019 --> 54:06.368
Somebody has to.

54:09.023 --> 54:12.548
It's just a ceremony.
Something to welcome you.

54:16.073 --> 54:17.932
It's still my choice, right?

54:18.032 --> 54:20.325
Of course.

54:20.425 --> 54:23.459
But you're a smart girl.
You'll choose God.

54:23.559 --> 54:25.953
Because the only other
option is the wicked.

54:49.672 --> 54:51.966
What are you doing?

54:52.066 --> 54:53.154
Going to my room.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.419
I saw you by
the fence earlier.

55:00.291 --> 55:03.891
You should know that someone
is always watching in this place.

55:03.991 --> 55:05.557
And what're you?
My prison guard?

55:07.124 --> 55:09.722
You've got a sharp tongue.

55:09.822 --> 55:11.202
You should be careful with it.

55:11.302 --> 55:12.508
Could get you in trouble.

55:12.608 --> 55:15.424
My mother always
used to say that.

55:15.524 --> 55:16.860
Guess I haven't had
the chance to test

55:16.960 --> 55:18.266
the theory out on strangers.

55:20.050 --> 55:22.561
Well, you'll have plenty
of opportunity now.

55:22.661 --> 55:24.781
Want me to walk you back
to the celebration?

55:24.881 --> 55:27.057
No, I can do it myself.

55:29.494 --> 55:32.310
I had a hard time
when I came here.

55:32.410 --> 55:35.792
What I'm saying is,
if you have trouble adjusting,

55:35.892 --> 55:37.794
don't hesitate to talk with me.

55:37.894 --> 55:41.667
Is that something
you do for everyone?

55:41.767 --> 55:44.379
Let's just say it's nice
having a new face around.

55:48.818 --> 55:50.167
Ben.

55:53.170 --> 55:56.204
If I wanted to get my things
from the armory and leave,

55:56.304 --> 55:59.120
could I talk to you about that?

55:59.220 --> 56:01.831
For your sake,
I'll pretend you didn't ask that.

56:04.007 --> 56:06.214
So I'm a prisoner here then.

56:06.314 --> 56:07.706
Tread lightly, Anna.

56:09.752 --> 56:11.088
Folks around here
don't like people

56:11.188 --> 56:14.570
turning their back
on the true path.

56:14.670 --> 56:18.052
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
I just--

56:18.152 --> 56:21.098
My wine has a way
of making people

56:21.198 --> 56:25.015
say things they don't mean.

56:25.115 --> 56:26.769
We'll keep this chat between us.

56:28.945 --> 56:32.905
And don't worry,
you'll get used to it around here.

56:34.472 --> 56:35.865
Almost everyone does.

57:04.111 --> 57:06.274
Lord, wash away the pestilence

57:06.374 --> 57:11.322
from this true believer
so that she may be one of us.

57:11.422 --> 57:13.890
I ask this in
the name of the Lord.

57:13.990 --> 57:14.991
Amen.

57:15.091 --> 57:16.732
Amen.

58:00.079 --> 58:01.503
Oh good, you're ready.

58:01.603 --> 58:03.474
It's time to get to work.

58:09.959 --> 58:12.644
How did you manage
to find all this stuff?

58:12.744 --> 58:15.560
Well, most of it was already
at the camp when we arrived.

58:15.660 --> 58:17.401
The rest we scavenged.

58:19.838 --> 58:21.131
Who made these?

58:21.231 --> 58:25.048
Our last blacksmith.

58:25.148 --> 58:27.094
What happened to them?

58:27.194 --> 58:29.705
He turned from the true path.

58:29.805 --> 58:32.099
Now defense is always
our priority,

58:32.199 --> 58:33.491
so I need you to get
these weapons

58:33.591 --> 58:35.232
into fighting shape and over to Ben.

58:35.332 --> 58:39.031
He'll tell you what we could use more of
and you'll make it.

58:40.685 --> 58:42.500
That all?

58:42.600 --> 58:45.329
People will need tools repaired,
that sort of thing.

58:45.429 --> 58:46.330
All right.

58:46.430 --> 58:47.636
We're almost out of coal,

58:47.736 --> 58:49.564
so use a wood fire
whenever you can.

58:52.131 --> 58:53.655
I'll leave you to it.

59:08.409 --> 59:09.527
I'm Anna.

59:09.627 --> 59:10.876
I'm Sarah.

59:10.976 --> 59:12.574
This is Lauren and that's Maria.

59:12.674 --> 59:14.023
Oh, they're such pretty names.

59:15.329 --> 59:17.753
You're truly blessed.

59:17.853 --> 59:18.884
Why do you say that?

59:18.984 --> 59:20.190
Isn't it obvious?

59:20.290 --> 59:23.106
You've been sponsored by Peter.

59:23.206 --> 59:24.847
Yes. It was very
kind of him

59:24.947 --> 59:26.718
to welcome me into your community.

59:26.818 --> 59:30.692
I wish I was older,
maybe he would've chosen me as his first.

59:32.476 --> 59:34.509
What do you mean by that?

59:34.609 --> 59:36.250
You have to be 15
to be sponsored.

59:36.350 --> 59:38.382
I'm 13.

59:38.482 --> 59:39.831
So none of you have
been re-baptized yet?

59:41.442 --> 59:43.300
No, don't be silly.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.129
We've all been cleansed
of the pestilence.

59:46.229 --> 59:49.219
I'm sorry. I guess
I just don't understand your customs yet.

59:49.319 --> 59:52.135
You're bound to him by God now.

59:52.235 --> 59:55.107
I hope one day my sponsoring
is as pretty as yours.

59:58.154 --> 59:59.764
I'm sure it will be.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.268
The charges are as follows:

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:40.923
One, this man did
willfully enter the lands

01:00:41.023 --> 01:00:42.229
that we have claimed

01:00:42.329 --> 01:00:44.069
with the intent
to steal from us.

01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:50.149
Two, his clan has engaged
in raiding and murder

01:00:50.249 --> 01:00:53.252
against the good citizens
of this village.

01:00:55.429 --> 01:00:59.637
Three, and most grievous,
this man did willfully

01:00:59.737 --> 01:01:03.075
turn his back on God

01:01:03.175 --> 01:01:05.874
and embrace a pagan worship
of the pestilence.

01:01:12.141 --> 01:01:15.492
Do you have anything
to say to these charges?

01:01:30.072 --> 01:01:33.845
Judgment has been
passed by the Elders

01:01:33.945 --> 01:01:36.892
in accordance to
the laws of this sanctuary.

01:01:36.992 --> 01:01:40.461
The penalty for these
crimes is death.

01:01:40.561 --> 01:01:43.607
The sentence to be carried out tonight
at moon's first light.

01:01:45.043 --> 01:01:47.859
May the fiery wrath of God

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:50.079
cleanse this idolater
from our midst.

01:01:50.179 --> 01:01:51.776
Amen.

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:53.269
Amen.

01:02:08.327 --> 01:02:11.579
Well, I have some business
to attend to.

01:02:11.679 --> 01:02:13.332
We should be together later.

01:02:56.114 --> 01:02:57.594
Recognize me?

01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:16.818
I'd never forget a pretty thing like you.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.297
So you can talk.

01:03:18.397 --> 01:03:21.300
When it suits me.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.041
You're pathetic.

01:03:23.141 --> 01:03:24.521
You stole.

01:03:24.621 --> 01:03:26.741
Your brother paid for that crime.

01:03:26.841 --> 01:03:29.004
Pretending to be infected?

01:03:29.104 --> 01:03:30.222
Spreading fear?

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:32.529
Your people murder
in the name of God.

01:03:32.629 --> 01:03:35.489
Weakness.

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:37.360
Stop hiding behind Him.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.709
I'm not hiding.

01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:40.232
And these are not my people.

01:03:40.332 --> 01:03:41.538
I make my own fate.

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.192
You speak the truth.

01:03:43.292 --> 01:03:45.412
Fate be yours.

01:03:45.512 --> 01:03:46.948
Make what you will.

01:03:48.906 --> 01:03:52.214
Let me go and I will
show you the path.

01:03:53.302 --> 01:03:54.477
No.

01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:57.511
Tonight you get
what you deserve.

01:03:57.611 --> 01:03:58.655
Deserve?

01:04:00.265 --> 01:04:02.211
We let this village stand.

01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:03.952
You're safe because of us.

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:05.388
What are you talking about?

01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:08.130
Why do you think no Changed
wander these woods?

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:11.668
We became what was needed
to stop The Changing.

01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:16.617
Don't you see?

01:04:16.717 --> 01:04:19.546
All your prayers
have been answered.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.289
We are not the disease.
We are the solution.

01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.291
We are the cure.

01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:31.370
A price has been demanded.

01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:32.863
All of you will pay.

01:04:38.434 --> 01:04:41.045
You left this behind the night
you killed my brother.

01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:44.571
When you die tonight,
think of him.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.009
I won't burn.

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:06.549
What were you doing
talking to the condemned?

01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:09.813
Nothing.

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:13.195
Did he say anything to you?

01:05:13.295 --> 01:05:18.374
He was just talking crazy,
saying we were all going to die.

01:05:18.474 --> 01:05:20.607
You got more out of him
than I did.

01:05:22.521 --> 01:05:24.554
Well, I think he just
thought I was pretty.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:27.309
I suppose even
the crazy have eyes.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.391
Don't let it bother you.

01:05:35.491 --> 01:05:37.275
He'll be gone by tonight.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.005
Thanks, Zack.

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:42.759
You're one of us now.

01:05:44.413 --> 01:05:45.675
We share everything here.

01:05:49.461 --> 01:05:51.668
If you ever need
anything from me,

01:05:51.768 --> 01:05:53.335
you don't hesitate to ask.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.079
You've all been
so nice to me.

01:06:14.486 --> 01:06:15.531
What are you doing?

01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:18.347
Leaving.

01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:20.275
Like I should've done
when you murdered those men.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.160
You know it was no
coincidence me finding you.

01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:40.904
I prayed for it and God answered.

01:06:45.082 --> 01:06:47.028
I knew He was testing me when
you stayed at that cabin.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.682
I almost made you
come with me.

01:06:48.782 --> 01:06:50.131
But I knew...

01:06:51.785 --> 01:06:54.296
I knew He would provide.

01:06:54.396 --> 01:06:55.689
You lied to me.

01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:57.691
Look around.

01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:00.998
It's old maids and little girls.

01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:02.709
I needed a woman.
I needed...

01:07:04.275 --> 01:07:05.581
I needed an equal.

01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:08.658
I didn't agree to that.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.704
You stepped into the water.

01:07:10.804 --> 01:07:12.096
Do I belong
to Zack, too?

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:13.924
Well, no more than
I did Judith.

01:07:14.024 --> 01:07:15.491
They're Elders.
It's their right.

01:07:15.591 --> 01:07:18.494
But I'm strong now.
I'll protect you.

01:07:18.594 --> 01:07:19.713
You're all twisted up.

01:07:19.813 --> 01:07:20.714
No, no, no, no. no.
You see, you see...

01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.672
We need to rebuild.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:25.688
Our children will
be great leaders.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.162
Somebody help me!

01:07:34.262 --> 01:07:35.729
Peter? You in there?

01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:37.395
We've got an emergency.

01:07:50.452 --> 01:07:51.745
Is everything all right in here?

01:07:51.845 --> 01:07:53.311
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're fine.

01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:55.109
What's the emergency?

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:01.711
One of our scouts
just reported

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.887
a pack of Berserkers making
their way out of the city.

01:08:03.987 --> 01:08:05.367
They're on their way.

01:08:05.467 --> 01:08:06.716
Well, how do they even
know we have him?

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:09.327
I don't know but they do.

01:08:09.427 --> 01:08:10.894
We'll have to double
the guards at the perimeter.

01:08:10.994 --> 01:08:12.243
We don't have that
kind of manpower.

01:08:12.343 --> 01:08:13.767
If just one of those
bastards gets through...

01:08:13.867 --> 01:08:15.203
Then we'll have to go out
and meet them head on.

01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:16.826
It's not too late
to make a deal.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:19.742
All right.

01:08:21.352 --> 01:08:22.645
We take the prisoner with us.

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:24.299
We can trade him
if we have to.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.301
Zack will agree.
You're coming, too.

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:27.837
- I don't think that's a--
- It's not your decision to make.

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:30.796
It's all right, Ben.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.953
Come back safe.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.022
Last I saw they were heading
towards Fillman's Pass.

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.028
Hold up.

01:09:32.814 --> 01:09:35.805
Lee, help carry Anna's stuff.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.602
Come on.

01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:48.483
Knife, too.

01:09:57.013 --> 01:09:59.002
Give me your hands.

01:09:59.102 --> 01:10:00.712
I said give me your hands.

01:10:05.587 --> 01:10:07.663
I waited until we were
out of the camp

01:10:07.763 --> 01:10:10.144
so you wouldn't be embarrassed.

01:10:10.244 --> 01:10:12.059
Big of you.

01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:13.887
It's for your own good

01:10:13.987 --> 01:10:16.150
until you earn back my trust.

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.512
Keep an eye on her.

01:10:34.268 --> 01:10:36.966
Get up!
Come on.

01:10:49.892 --> 01:10:51.576
I know our village isn't perfect

01:10:51.676 --> 01:10:54.623
but there's worse out there.

01:10:54.723 --> 01:10:56.233
That doesn't justify this.

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:58.453
Peter's a good man.

01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:00.455
But when he gets an idea
in his head...

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:03.458
Just give him time.

01:11:03.558 --> 01:11:05.255
I'm sure you'll grow to like him.

01:11:06.953 --> 01:11:08.780
Don't have much of a choice, do I?

01:11:11.044 --> 01:11:12.946
No.

01:11:13.046 --> 01:11:14.830
Few of us do.

01:11:18.051 --> 01:11:19.866
That Berserker
killed my brother.

01:11:19.966 --> 01:11:21.619
Letting him go isn't right.

01:11:24.057 --> 01:11:27.090
Nothing will bring
your brother back.

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:30.933
This will guarantee
the security of our village.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.241
Wouldn't your brother
have wanted that?

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.187
You didn't know David.

01:11:37.287 --> 01:11:39.072
No, I didn't.

01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:43.554
Listen...

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:47.602
If things go bad today...

01:11:49.212 --> 01:11:51.258
Don't let yourself
get captured.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.553
It's better to die out here
than to let them

01:11:55.653 --> 01:11:57.003
have their way with you.

01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.400
Let's go.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.323
Peter.

01:12:14.803 --> 01:12:17.066
Trail goes cold here.

01:12:36.607 --> 01:12:39.075
Where are your people?

01:12:39.175 --> 01:12:41.221
I told you I wouldn't burn.

01:12:42.874 --> 01:12:44.659
Well, it's not night yet.

01:12:45.747 --> 01:12:47.257
Maybe we should head back.

01:12:47.357 --> 01:12:49.433
This has a bad feeling to it.

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:51.392
No, they couldn't know
that we'd have him with us.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.885
Are you sure about that?

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.223
No. No.
We need him alive!

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.101
No, Anna. Anna, wait!

01:13:49.854 --> 01:13:51.117
Anna?

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.770
David?

01:13:58.298 --> 01:14:00.765
I thought you were dead.

01:14:00.865 --> 01:14:03.129
If they find you, they'll kill you.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.089
What should we do?

01:14:08.221 --> 01:14:10.166
There's no time.

01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:11.267
I'm sorry about this.

01:14:49.262 --> 01:14:51.077
Your sister was with them.

01:14:51.177 --> 01:14:53.614
She ran.
I lost her in the woods.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.677
Your first battle.

01:15:17.464 --> 01:15:19.292
This honor belongs to you.

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:22.120
Leave him.

01:15:37.353 --> 01:15:39.603
Fate be yours.

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:42.097
Make what you will.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.669
Join us or meet your maker.

01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:18.816
Well, let's get on with it.

01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:20.396
I ain't got all night.

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.936
Find any stragglers then meet
the others at the lake village.

01:16:40.373 --> 01:16:41.622
They started this war.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.625
But tonight, we finish it.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.292
Not you.

01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:15.743
You did well tonight.

01:17:15.843 --> 01:17:16.918
Thank you.

01:17:17.018 --> 01:17:19.964
But your sister.

01:17:20.064 --> 01:17:22.315
You let her escape.

01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:23.925
- I--
- Don't be afraid.

01:17:24.025 --> 01:17:27.320
You've proven yourself.
But you know our ways.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.509
A price must be paid.

01:17:30.988 --> 01:17:32.338
I'm willing.

01:17:35.253 --> 01:17:36.429
Good.

01:17:44.262 --> 01:17:49.224
Pain is the only certainty in life.

01:17:54.185 --> 01:17:56.753
We are all that stands
against the plague.

01:17:59.713 --> 01:18:03.760
We cannot show weakness.

01:18:05.109 --> 01:18:07.634
I know it.

01:18:08.678 --> 01:18:09.810
That's enough!

01:18:13.683 --> 01:18:15.846
You are full of
surprises, little girl.

01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:18.819
Shut up.
Back away from him.

01:18:23.389 --> 01:18:24.955
You should've saved yourself.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.511
We're family.

01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:32.093
Your mistake is thinking
that he needs to be saved.

01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:39.492
What are you doing?

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:44.353
They're my family now.

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:46.355
But you can choose like I did.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.835
Join us.

01:18:47.935 --> 01:18:49.445
We could be together again.

01:18:49.545 --> 01:18:51.752
You're murderers.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.797
It wasn't David who
killed that man.

01:18:53.897 --> 01:18:56.191
I don't blame David.
I blame you.

01:18:56.291 --> 01:18:57.497
He's offering freedom
from the shackles

01:18:57.597 --> 01:18:58.672
of this dead society.

01:18:58.772 --> 01:19:00.587
You're not free.
That's a lie.

01:19:00.687 --> 01:19:03.024
No. The lie is thinking
that I was weak.

01:19:03.124 --> 01:19:05.853
Fearing the Changed.

01:19:05.953 --> 01:19:06.984
Now I defend the weak.

01:19:07.084 --> 01:19:08.769
You were never weak.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.784
He's manipulating you.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.603
The past is dust.
But the future is clay.

01:19:16.703 --> 01:19:19.053
It is ours to mold.

01:19:20.315 --> 01:19:21.882
David has made a choice.

01:19:23.318 --> 01:19:26.539
Fate be yours.
Make what you will.

01:19:28.192 --> 01:19:30.138
David, you're my brother.

01:19:30.238 --> 01:19:33.589
You have two paths.
You must choose.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.496
Pitiful.

01:19:40.596 --> 01:19:43.151
But silence is a choice.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:46.894
Let this be your final test.

01:19:46.994 --> 01:19:49.605
Leave that weak boy in the dust
where he belongs.

01:19:53.957 --> 01:19:55.250
David, please.

01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:56.960
Fate be yours.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:01.909
Kill her or I will.

01:20:02.009 --> 01:20:04.968
Make what you will.
I'm sorry.

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:38.075
They heard the shot.
You got to go.

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:39.599
You mean we.

01:20:39.699 --> 01:20:40.743
I'm not going with you.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:46.519
But you're alive.

01:20:46.619 --> 01:20:48.521
We can start over.

01:20:48.621 --> 01:20:50.653
I've saved you twice now.

01:20:50.753 --> 01:20:52.102
There can't be a third.

01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:55.671
I came back to save you.

01:20:57.717 --> 01:20:59.196
Does it look like
I need your help?

01:21:03.244 --> 01:21:04.885
They're coming. Run.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.596
No. Run!

01:21:22.219 --> 01:21:24.700
Hey. Hey. Hey.
They're coming.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:44.707
You're alive.

01:21:44.807 --> 01:21:46.840
I told you I'd protect you.

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.755
We should go.
There's more of them coming.

01:21:48.855 --> 01:21:50.378
- There's something I have to show you.
- No!

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.969
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.016
Is that the village?

01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:23.367
The fires started
hours ago.

01:22:26.632 --> 01:22:29.373
We should go back.
There could be survivors.

01:22:32.855 --> 01:22:34.944
I don't understand.

01:22:36.729 --> 01:22:37.978
God was on our side.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.154
How could this...

01:22:40.254 --> 01:22:42.125
How could this happen?

01:22:44.867 --> 01:22:46.303
God doesn't choose sides.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.833
He chose me.

01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:58.999
I wish that were true.

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:00.535
Really.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:05.353
Our community was corrupt.

01:23:05.453 --> 01:23:07.311
See, I can see that now.

01:23:07.411 --> 01:23:10.227
I can, I can see,
I can see that now.

01:23:10.327 --> 01:23:13.709
But you and me, we can,
we can build something better.

01:23:13.809 --> 01:23:16.538
No. No!

01:23:16.638 --> 01:23:17.757
Can't you see?

01:23:17.857 --> 01:23:19.367
This is all part of His plan.

01:23:19.467 --> 01:23:20.486
It has to be.

01:23:20.586 --> 01:23:21.639
Stop it!

01:23:24.951 --> 01:23:26.426
You wouldn't want them to hear.

01:24:09.256 --> 01:24:10.924
It's okay, Anna.

01:24:11.824 --> 01:24:15.741
Anna, Anna, I forgive you.

01:25:26.942 --> 01:25:29.627
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

01:25:29.727 --> 01:25:32.718
You'd have been
my last choice to survive.

01:25:32.818 --> 01:25:34.776
I'd have even taken Ben.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.610
Help me get him down.

01:25:49.791 --> 01:25:51.619
Is there anybody left?

01:25:53.795 --> 01:25:56.480
What about
the kids, Judith?

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.179
It was chaos.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.921
They weren't quick
about it either.

01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:03.661
Torturing. Raping.

01:26:03.761 --> 01:26:04.880
You survived.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.578
I hid.

01:26:07.678 --> 01:26:10.551
But I could see everything.

01:26:12.553 --> 01:26:15.034
I couldn't save him.

01:26:18.211 --> 01:26:19.821
I didn't even try.

01:26:24.086 --> 01:26:26.380
What--what about Peter?
If you didn't see him--

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.916
Peter got
what he deserved.

01:26:32.965 --> 01:26:36.390
It wasn't always
like this, you know.

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:42.104
But then life
changes you bit by bit.

01:26:43.976 --> 01:26:47.793
The world didn't make you
a bad person, Judith.

01:26:47.893 --> 01:26:49.285
You did that
all on your own.

01:26:52.245 --> 01:26:55.291
I guess it would've been
easier if I'd died.

01:26:58.642 --> 01:27:01.123
But God spared me.

01:27:05.649 --> 01:27:06.824
Where do you mean to go now?

01:27:11.917 --> 01:27:14.863
I've never seen the ocean.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:17.344
Figure I'll start there.

01:27:17.444 --> 01:27:19.128
And then what?

01:27:19.228 --> 01:27:21.217
Find good people?

01:27:21.317 --> 01:27:22.536
Make a better life?

01:27:25.234 --> 01:27:27.149
That doesn't exist anymore.

01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:33.055
There are worse things in
this world than Berserkers.

01:27:33.155 --> 01:27:36.319
You've never even
seen a Changed.

01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:40.293
You're going to get yourself
killed chasing a dream, Anna.

01:27:45.863 --> 01:27:47.914
Dreams give us hope.

01:27:48.214 --> 01:27:50.943
And if we don't have hope,

01:27:51.043 --> 01:27:52.901
then what's the point in living?
