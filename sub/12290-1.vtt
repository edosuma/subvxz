Martin, can you hear me?

08:52.908 --> 08:56.161
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.499
Martin, you crashed your car.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.669
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

09:03.836 --> 09:07.256
There is more than one can say
about your friends.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.927
Have you seen

09:15.055 --> 09:17.766
Have you seen creatures?

09:18.767 --> 09:21.895
The things

09:22.062 --> 09:27.025
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.071
Roy and Erlend?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.952
- Hanna?
- We found friends. All of them.

09:37.119 --> 09:41.123
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

09:41.290 --> 09:44.710
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.171
With an ax driven into the neck.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.924
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.887
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.723
They came up from

09:58.849 --> 10:03.604
From the snow. Creatures. Nazi.
We stuck, but

10:03.770 --> 10:07.232
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

10:07.399 --> 10:12.029
Are you sure
that he has brain damage?

10:12.196 --> 10:18.076
Please call the family and say he is awakened.
Ask the Attorney send a car.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.538
And four additional men. You are
ready to be transported.

10:21.705 --> 10:26.210
They are out there yet. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

10:26.376 --> 10:30.714
We should not stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

10:30.881 --> 10:36.136
- You'll be right in jail.
- No one knows what happened there.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.182
Only you know that.
And it's not just bad news.

10:40.349 --> 10:45.812
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn across.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.149
- It was not torn
- When we found you, it was cold.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.737
The snow had chilled all,
and it was very good.

10:53.904 --> 10:57.908
- And then we found the arm in the car.
- In the car?

10:58.075 --> 11:02.788
It was slightly bruised and quite pale,
bit strange, basically, -

11:02.955 --> 11:05.332
- But the operation was a success.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.544
We managed to stick your arm again.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.892
No, no, no

11:28.438 --> 11:31.859
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.904
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

11:36.071 --> 11:38.490
Calm down.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.666
No, it's not me!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.257
No!

12:00.679 --> 12:03.640
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.272
Stop!

13:03.575 --> 13:05.369
Randi?

13:05.536 --> 13:09.373
You need to settle down
removing the denture later.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.668
Tonight I'm ready for a little hue.

13:47.578 --> 13:52.207

Too much coffee. Just go ahead, you.

34:41.831 --> 34:44.585
This is a war museum, right?

34:44.751 --> 34:45.918
Yes.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.795
Yes, and

34:49.922 --> 34:53.677
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

35:18.869 --> 35:21.830

- Yes.

35:26.126 --> 35:29.546
- Second floor.
- Second floor.

35:40.724 --> 35:43.060
Where the hell are you?

35:45.562 --> 35:48.524
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

35:55.656 --> 35:58.450
Buddy with Hitler.

35:58.617 --> 36:02.871
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibits.

36:05.249 --> 36:08.043
"Herzog was made commander of Einsatz in 1942.

36:08.210 --> 36:12.172
and was sent to the far north of norway
in order to protect the warships -

36:12.339 --> 36:15.884
- that the German navy was hiding in the fjords.

36:16.051 --> 36:23.016
He was on duty in Øksfjord doing a routine inspection on the ship
Scharnolsht, when

36:23.183 --> 36:24.768
Scharnholst.

36:27.312 --> 36:32.150
When Tirpitz, the German
fleets biggest warship, -

36:32.317 --> 36:36.071
- Was attacked
by english bombers in Talvik -

36:36.238 --> 36:41.410
- After getting vital information on the ships location
from norwegian spies.

36:41.577 --> 36:45.455
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on Tirpitz
- ordered Herzog

36:45.622 --> 36:51.628
-to wipe out all the the 800
men and people who lived in talvik at the time. "

36:54.298 --> 36:57.426
Was he
He was on his way?

36:57.593 --> 37:03.807
He was on his way to Talvik the evening
they were slaughtered in Øksfjord?

37:03.974 --> 37:06.894
On behalf of Hitler.

37:11.565 --> 37:16.737
A mission that was never completed.
It is. Exactly what is it.

37:18.197 --> 37:20.908
They will destroy Talvik.

37:22.993 --> 37:24.661
where

37:29.875 --> 37:33.086
Herzog was going from Øksfjord -

37:33.253 --> 37:35.464
- Which is here.

37:35.631 --> 37:38.675
And he was going to talvik.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.220
It's here.

37:41.386 --> 37:43.263
Where are we now?

37:44.181 --> 37:45.933
Where are we now?!

37:48.519 --> 37:49.895
Here.

37:50.062 --> 37:52.814
Isnestoften.

37:56.652 --> 38:00.239
It is  in between.

38:00.405 --> 38:02.574
(screaming outside)

39:44.635 --> 39:47.221
They are recruiting!

39:48.138 --> 39:52.518
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that? Fuck!

39:52.684 --> 39:55.771
Okay, they come here.
There're coming now.

39:55.938 --> 40:00.609
I will not die in a museum
with a guy in a green jogging suit.

40:00.776 --> 40:03.403
Calm down.
You will die.

40:05.155 --> 40:07.449
But relax.
Not today.

41:59.436 --> 42:01.188
There!

42:03.440 --> 42:05.901
Let see
what this thing can do.

42:06.068 --> 42:07.903
What thing?

42:35.264 --> 42:38.809
What did you do?
You killed them only with your hand

42:38.976 --> 42:41.770
It's arm, man.

42:41.937 --> 42:46.733
Before I could not control it,
but now makes it known what I think.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.403
You're not even sweating.

42:50.279 --> 42:52.156
Do not worry about it.

42:57.161 --> 43:01.915
They build bigger.
Damn much larger.

43:02.082 --> 43:05.002
There are too many
through the arm.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.232
So much death.

43:35.449 --> 43:38.410
All this unnecessary death.

44:01.975 --> 44:03.936
(whimpering)

44:07.940 --> 44:10.067
Fuck!

44:10.234 --> 44:14.071
You did what he fucker
in the place. You just

44:14.238 --> 44:17.491
- You
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

44:45.269 --> 44:47.855
He does not attack

44:59.199 --> 45:01.577
Did you see that?did you see that
I hit it!

45:01.743 --> 45:05.038
I hit it!oh my god
I did it i fucking did it!

45:05.205 --> 45:07.875
I hit it right in the eye.oh my god

45:08.041 --> 45:11.545
oh my god take a picture. please take a picture of me.

45:11.712 --> 45:14.756
- First Zombie Squad kill.
- One, two

45:14.923 --> 45:16.884
cheese...!

45:17.676 --> 45:19.887
Did you get it?

45:20.053 --> 45:24.850
oh we spoke on the phone.
i'm Daniel, this is Blake and Monica.
-hi

45:25.017 --> 45:27.519
We are the Zombie Squad.

45:29.646 --> 45:33.150
- god damn it
- they're real ? these are real dead people?.

45:33.317 --> 45:36.153
And thats a real zombie.
You killed him.

45:36.320 --> 45:40.073
- i cant believe it.
- can we just focus for one second guys.

45:40.240 --> 45:44.453
i'm so sorry.
We are more professional than this.

45:44.620 --> 45:47.623
-you're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.209
- You're the Zombie Squad?.
- Yeah, we are the zombie squad

45:50.375 --> 45:54.421
i'm sorry.
I just expected something different.

45:54.588 --> 45:58.800
so was this guy
when he woke up this morning.

46:01.053 --> 46:03.514
Because I hit him in the face
with an ax.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.100
- yeah how did you find me?
- we tracked your iphone, of course.

46:07.267 --> 46:10.812
We're fucking nerds.
this is what we do technical shit, lets cut the chit chat

46:10.979 --> 46:15.192
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

46:20.739 --> 46:22.366
Revenge.

46:22.533 --> 46:25.118
(engine noise)

47:23.844 --> 47:26.972
this is insane!

47:28.098 --> 47:31.310
You? you have the gift?

47:31.476 --> 47:34.313
The force is strong with this one.

47:34.438 --> 47:36.148
ok

47:39.818 --> 47:44.573
Martin,
this is how we defeat them,
this is how we take them down

47:44.740 --> 47:48.118
- What do you mean?
- I mean

47:49.411 --> 47:51.705
We create an army of our own.

47:52.498 --> 47:55.709
I tried to get as much infomation as i could on the trip over.

47:55.876 --> 47:59.546
Especially about Herzog. To defeat
your enemy, you must know you enemy.

47:59.713 --> 48:03.091
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
of the Soviet army.

48:03.258 --> 48:06.762
Him and his battalion
was captured during the battle of Kursk.

48:06.929 --> 48:09.765
and brought here to the north of norway as pow's.

48:09.932 --> 48:13.435
In 1944 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain  -

48:13.602 --> 48:15.979
-to build a road through the mountain pass.

48:16.146 --> 48:20.984
but it was after they built the road that shit got ugly.

48:21.151 --> 48:26.615
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

48:26.782 --> 48:29.618
No survivors.

48:29.785 --> 48:33.247
And the man in charge

48:33.413 --> 48:35.165
Herzog.

48:35.749 --> 48:38.669
Those bodies are still buried there.

48:39.795 --> 48:44.508
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting.

48:47.469 --> 48:51.223
-  waiting for what?
- for he same thing that drives Herzog.

48:51.390 --> 48:55.894
Revenge.
-and guess who's gonna
give it to them.

48:57.938 --> 49:01.900
- the man who can raise the dead?
- kerfuckin ...!

49:02.067 --> 49:06.864
you guys go after Herzog try and slow him down,
give us as much time as possible. ok?

49:07.030 --> 49:09.741
- And what if this doesnt work?
- It has too.

49:09.908 --> 49:13.245
all we have to do is get to Kvenang mountain,
find stavarin wake him back from the dead -

49:13.412 --> 49:16.874
- then bring him back to Talvik
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

49:17.040 --> 49:20.335
Lett. Besides

49:21.920 --> 49:24.715
we got help.

49:29.178 --> 49:32.014
here we go.

49:40.731 --> 49:43.150
He is our last hope.

49:57.456 --> 49:59.625
look, a tank.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.685
(a sound from outside)

50:19.811 --> 50:22.481
- a Visitor now?
- It's early.

50:37.037 --> 50:38.997
(sound)

50:39.164 --> 50:40.874
Hello?

51:40.100 --> 51:41.894
(baby crying)

51:48.609 --> 51:51.695
Look,
his army is growing bigger.

51:53.363 --> 51:57.242
glenn are there more towns or villages
before he reaches talvik

51:57.409 --> 52:02.206
- maybe a few houses but thats it
- Good. so what he has now he'll use for his attack.

52:02.372 --> 52:06.835
yeah pretty much
that is untill he starts dealing with people of Talvik bekim and journhim as well.

52:07.002 --> 52:10.255
- How many people live in talvik?
- about 3000.

52:10.422 --> 52:14.384
- Holy shit!
- all the more reason for us to slow them down as much as we can.

52:15.636 --> 52:21.308
- look do you know how to use one of those things?
- of course.  I'm from northern Norway arent i.

52:21.475 --> 52:25.020
I dont know what that means, ok
guys pack light.

52:25.187 --> 52:27.689
we're moving out, now!

52:32.903 --> 52:36.949
What the deepest in hell
happened here?

52:37.908 --> 52:39.868
What do engineers?

52:40.035 --> 52:43.831
It is not technical,
Only Tom and Ole in a white coat.

52:43.997 --> 52:47.334
The thought
so a little more professionally out.

52:48.085 --> 52:51.505
NCIS should be herein night.

52:51.672 --> 52:56.218
- Do we have any witnesses?
- If you get the seagulls to chat happily.

52:56.385 --> 52:59.847
Gulls, yes.
Then you have a damn good invention.

53:00.013 --> 53:04.017
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

53:04.184 --> 53:07.437
He who finds a way
will be fucking rich.

53:07.563 --> 53:10.816
Get the bodies out of Talvik
before the gulls eat them up.

53:10.983 --> 53:16.113
And take  pictures, otherwise
NCIS will cut off my balls.

53:16.280 --> 53:20.075
Here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

53:23.495 --> 53:25.622
Is not that where ...?

53:29.918 --> 53:33.338
To me at the head of guttefitta mi.

53:36.842 --> 53:41.471
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

53:41.638 --> 53:44.266
Come on, man!
We have things to do!

53:47.352 --> 53:49.855
There they are.
And they have a tank i see.

53:50.022 --> 53:52.816
Yes, they stole it from the museum.

53:53.984 --> 53:55.402
ah Fuck!

53:56.945 --> 54:01.200
- What is that?
- A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

54:01.366 --> 54:04.119
No,no,no,no,no
That. What is that?

54:04.286 --> 54:08.957
oh these are replica's of the binoculars
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

54:09.124 --> 54:13.212
Did you guys know ...fun fact all of the hoth scenes,
-sssshhhhhh

54:13.378 --> 54:17.508
- Were filmed here in Norway.
this place called Finse.

54:17.674 --> 54:22.721
girls Could we please maybe focus on you know the Nazi zombies instead?

54:22.888 --> 54:27.392
- What do we do?
- well Daniel told us to slow them down, so thats what we're gonna do.

54:27.559 --> 54:29.353
Look.

54:30.354 --> 54:34.691
We need to get out there,
get their attention and then lure them into the swamps, right?

54:34.858 --> 54:40.155
And then when they get stuck,
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

54:40.322 --> 54:42.574
thats sounds basically impossible.

54:42.741 --> 54:46.495
And how were you planning on luring them out there?
We need bait. Live bait.

54:46.662 --> 54:50.123
yes we need someone to attract their attention,

54:50.290 --> 54:53.126
someOne who is light on their feet.

54:53.293 --> 54:58.048
who knows these swamps
and can move through them without getting stuck.

55:04.388 --> 55:05.931
What?

55:06.098 --> 55:07.808
No.

55:07.975 --> 55:11.019

59:22.312 --> 59:24.106
Come on, Glenn!

59:25.983 --> 59:28.026
Yes, go

59:34.324 --> 59:36.869
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

59:37.035 --> 59:38.745
go.go!

59:46.461 --> 59:48.338
Please god

59:54.845 --> 59:56.555
Yes!

59:56.722 --> 59:59.474
OMG, Blake!

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.520
USA, USA!

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.689
USA!

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.943
Shoot.

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:23.457
Hey. that tank is moving.

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.504
that cant be good.

01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:43.644
Run!

01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:50.025
Run!

01:00:59.576 --> 01:01:00.619
oh My God!

01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:26.562
Talvik. Now.

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:22.326
Hey.

01:02:24.495 --> 01:02:27.456
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.833
But we're also stuck.

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:38.258
- Can I push it?
- I dont, i dont think that will help.

01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:42.888
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We dont have that kind of time.

01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:48.018
i mean If only we could find something -

01:02:48.185 --> 01:02:52.147
- to put under the car you know
something that would give us traction.

01:02:52.314 --> 01:02:55.067
Then I could get us out of here.

01:02:59.238 --> 01:03:01.907
(whimpering scared)

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:49.037
- There you are, yes.
- Satan lives to accommodate all equal.

01:03:49.204 --> 01:03:53.917
The dress is absolutely stuffed full.
We had to throw the rest in the garage.

01:03:54.084 --> 01:03:57.588
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

01:03:58.589 --> 01:04:03.719
Most Germans and French.
Hardly the vacation they envisioned.

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:07.556
To get worn off his head and arms
and get entrails torn out?

01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:10.434
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

01:04:15.772 --> 01:04:18.650
- Should you do that?
- No.

01:04:18.817 --> 01:04:21.904
- Should not NCIS been here now?
- It gave a lot in Alta.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:26.200
The plane could not land.
They are here in the morning, they say.

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:32.247
- It's perfect.
- What?

01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:36.168
It's our chance.

01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:40.130
Now, we fucking show people
what we're made of here.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:45.010
We here at Talvik Police
find Martin Hykkerud itself.

01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:49.389
We get him. Vi.
We will be heroes.

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:53.519
Not the goddamn suit-clad,
homofriserte -

01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:57.064
- Sushi-eating hestkukene south.

01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:00.192
Beef boys

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:05.531
Brief guys. Send photos to
all gossips throughout Talvik.

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:10.410
He stops to pee, I
Knowing the color and smell of urine.

01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:14.581
- Odor and color.
- And make ready their weapons.

01:05:14.748 --> 01:05:18.252
Now we shoot anything other than gulls,
for once.

01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:26.009
Do you really
think this is going to  work?

01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:31.014
I mean,
say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:34.017
Whats stopping them from killing us?

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.982
I dont know whats gonna happen.
But judging based on him -

01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:44.069
- he treats you like you're his master,
so hopefully they'll do the same.

01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.196
Hopefully.

01:05:46.363 --> 01:05:50.325
look I dont know man
this is some unprecedented unheard of -

01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:55.539
- Mysterious voodoo zombie shit man
I've never seen this before.

01:05:55.706 --> 01:06:01.044
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:05.007
You have created a whole new genre here man.

01:06:05.174 --> 01:06:09.511
look i mean if we're gonna go up against a battalion of
Nazi zombies -

01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:13.515
-we could do a whole lot worse than
teaming up with a battlion of russian zombies.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:19.980
He has to die you know?. Herzog.

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:23.775
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.323
I have to  kill him.
For Hanna.

01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:35.829
- this it is.
- Yeah.

01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:40.375
this is definitely it.

01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:46.048
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:50.886
So they've got to be buried in this frozen ground.
.

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:55.140
how we do this?

01:06:55.307 --> 01:06:57.059
we do it just like you did  -

01:06:58.227 --> 01:06:59.978
- with him.

01:07:00.145 --> 01:07:02.773
I put my hand on his head.

01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:06.527
Okay. Right.

01:07:08.403 --> 01:07:11.073
we cant dig up everyone it will take weeks.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.494
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.182
Lord.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:50.023
f**k yeah!

01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:26.560
He was first seen here.

01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:29.938
In Øksfjord.

01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:35.777
And next time here.
Museum at lsnestoften.

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:40.365
So it looks as if
he's heading south. Perhaps there.

01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:44.328
We have a problem.

01:10:45.162 --> 01:10:49.166
A gang dressed as Germans
going bananas out there?

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:52.377
Bananas?
They killed loads of different people.

01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:57.341
We have not had a murder since 74,
and suddenly there Ragnarok.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:11:03.096
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:51.854
There is no one here.
We have showed them the door.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.189
They are gone.

01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:59.695
Since you can not complete the mission, -

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:04.366
- You can just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:36.273
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Been a little bigger.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:43.447
I also taught a couple of buddies
the dance.

01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:32.412
Is  it not a bit sour
when you thought someone was dead -

01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:35.457
- Coming back to kill you?

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:04.862
Let's kill them.

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:06.446
Troops!

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.243
Attack!

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:17.833
Let's kill them all!

01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:32.950
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.672
they have tanks?

01:16:38.348 --> 01:16:40.434
- Damn!
- Run!

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:42.186
Help!

01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:11.548
Daniel! tank.

01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:27.374
- Should not we help them?
- Help who?

01:18:27.541 --> 01:18:32.546
Those with blemishes in german uniform
or those with blemishes in Russian?

01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:04.203
<i> okay </ i></i>

01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:19.009
Good boy.

01:19:31.355 --> 01:19:35.108
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell's going on?

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:38.529
Do as hell.
Looks like a video game.

01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:41.156
look Martin Hykkerud!

01:19:43.116 --> 01:19:44.576
- Yes!
- Should we take him?

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:48.080
No, no.
Wait until it calms down.

01:19:48.247 --> 01:19:51.750
this is tactical policing.

01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:20.404
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

01:20:20.571 --> 01:20:22.948
- thats a long story.
- There was a tank.

01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:25.450
And guy took my jacket.

01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:30.622
- looks like you found Stavarin and his men i see.
- Yeah but there's still more them than us .

01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:33.625
i guess it's time we even out the odds a bit huh.

01:21:18.253 --> 01:21:20.255
guys! We're losing!

01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:23.300
look!

01:21:25.219 --> 01:21:27.054
shit!

01:21:37.064 --> 01:21:39.066
No, no, no

01:21:39.233 --> 01:21:41.318
No!

01:21:49.868 --> 01:21:51.578
Wait!

01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:54.581
We have to kill him!

01:21:54.748 --> 01:21:57.459
They're all bound to him like the russians are to you
.

01:21:57.626 --> 01:22:00.712
If he dies, the others will too .

01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:06.468
lets finish this.

01:22:08.554 --> 01:22:10.472
<i> Untermensch. </ i></i>

01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:29.843
guys come on.
No seat belts?

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.221
You just asking for it.

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:04.962
fuckin hell how many more of these are there?

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:12.928
Is this it?

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:17.558
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

01:24:17.724 --> 01:24:19.434
No, no.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.729
- we're gonna die now?
- No.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.234
Fuck it.

01:24:28.569 --> 01:24:30.946
fuck it i'm just gonna say it.
-what?

01:24:32.364 --> 01:24:34.074
I, -

01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:37.035
- Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, is

01:24:37.995 --> 01:24:39.705
No!

01:24:41.582 --> 01:24:43.625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:46.295
Monica ..

01:27:52.898 --> 01:27:55.901
Why did not you just
stay on the mountain?

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:05.536
You got's what you should have.
You got the gold.

01:28:09.665 --> 01:28:11.917
But it was not enough.

01:28:14.670 --> 01:28:17.840
You were greedy.

01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:21.093
wanted more.

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.178
Blake

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.517
- Monica
- watch out!

01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:33.272
- Monica!
- Blake!

01:28:37.484 --> 01:28:39.611
Blake! No!

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:53.458
That's why you lost.

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:57.004
Because you were greedy.

01:29:02.384 --> 01:29:05.512
You know you lost the war?

01:29:07.306 --> 01:29:09.933
Lost everything.

01:29:11.477 --> 01:29:14.521
ridiculed.

01:29:14.688 --> 01:29:17.024
Pathetic.

01:29:18.317 --> 01:29:19.902
And you know what?

01:29:22.196 --> 01:29:23.572
You lose again.

01:29:32.748 --> 01:29:34.374
No!

01:29:47.596 --> 01:29:49.306
My God!

01:29:52.392 --> 01:29:54.311
He did it!

01:29:54.478 --> 01:29:59.566
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:03.403
Herzog is dead.

01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:05.823
He is dead. Yes!

01:30:21.338 --> 01:30:24.091
that was close.

01:30:35.936 --> 01:30:39.314
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:43.735
i cant believe that that actually worked.

01:30:43.902 --> 01:30:46.572
Of course it did.

01:30:46.738 --> 01:30:49.533
you doubted the Zombie Squad?

01:30:51.076 --> 01:30:53.704
Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?

01:30:56.165 --> 01:30:58.208
He didnt make it.

01:31:09.386 --> 01:31:13.390
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:17.144
you too martin.

01:31:21.482 --> 01:31:24.943
What is it? Okay.

01:31:26.153 --> 01:31:28.822
- You can say it.
- go for it.

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:34.870
May the force be with you.

01:31:38.373 --> 01:31:42.377
Really? That one?
Of all the ...? You chose that one?

01:31:42.544 --> 01:31:46.673
theres like a million to choose from,
why would you choose that one?

01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:14.117
- Where the hell are they?
- I know as hell.

01:32:14.284 --> 01:32:18.038
Hell too! Bjarne!

01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:21.250
Are you in a coma?

01:32:21.416 --> 01:32:23.794
Go and find them, dammit!

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:32.886
I would resolve this matter.
Do not end with a hundred new corpses.

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:38.100
Where do we fit it all?
The garage and the freezer is packed.

01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:41.520
I do not know! I do not know.

01:32:47.401 --> 01:32:52.614
The gulls again. They've not
eaten so well since the war.

01:32:54.616 --> 01:32:58.245
We should have
the damn machine.

01:32:58.412 --> 01:33:01.665
Whoever translates
seagull language to human language.

01:33:01.832 --> 01:33:05.502
Then we would fuck me
Jack the matter as an egg.

01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:08.547
As an egg.

01:36:01.261 --> 01:36:03.889
(groan)
