01:59.813 --> 02:03.066
- Lula loves her syrup.
- You have enough syrup.

02:03.149 --> 02:05.819
Mrs. Butterworths
isn't a squirt bottle.

02:05.902 --> 02:07.862
It's no big deal. You've had enough.

02:07.946 --> 02:11.241
- Mom, these aren't brown enough.
- Do you want me to burn them?

02:11.324 --> 02:13.660
No, but I just want them more brown.

02:13.743 --> 02:16.204
Mikey, Mom's not a short order cook.

02:16.287 --> 02:17.789
Eat up now.

02:19.416 --> 02:22.085
Double knots?
We never did double knots.

02:22.168 --> 02:25.130
- Sweetie, I can't get it.
- Don't use a fork.

02:25.171 --> 02:27.882
No bubbles at the table.
Eat your breakfast first.

02:27.966 --> 02:30.844
She's right, you know,
my eggs taste like bubbles now.

02:36.641 --> 02:39.686
- Hurry up, honey, you'll be late.
- All right.

02:39.769 --> 02:43.189
The van needs an inspection sticker.
Good luck.

02:48.069 --> 02:50.238
Alrighty.

02:50.321 --> 02:52.866
What's this?
Look who's hiding.

02:52.949 --> 02:57.370
Mr. Dino...
and another weird stowaway.

02:57.454 --> 02:59.539
Okay, Nathan, no cereal in my thingie.

02:59.622 --> 03:01.374
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, honey.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.625
Nathan!

03:36.576 --> 03:38.745
- What's that?
- What?

03:38.828 --> 03:39.996
That.

03:41.664 --> 03:43.625
Maple syrup.

03:47.087 --> 03:51.466
Mmm, man! Can you believe
that comes from a tree?

03:51.549 --> 03:53.259
Don't taste my pants.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.095
I can't taste your pants?

03:55.136 --> 03:56.930
Ever.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.264
- Ever?
- No.

03:58.348 --> 04:00.600
Well, don't spill maple syrup on them.

04:00.683 --> 04:03.436
Just because it's there
doesn't mean you have to taste it.

04:03.478 --> 04:05.563
- I like maple syrup.
- Not from my pants.

04:05.647 --> 04:07.107
I love it.

04:10.151 --> 04:14.239
How about this:
What if you had, like, an inkpad...

04:15.281 --> 04:19.619
only instead of ink,
it was soaked in maple syrup.

04:19.702 --> 04:22.163
Or peppermint.
Any flavor you wanted.

04:23.540 --> 04:29.087
- And you just open up your little pad.
- Right.

04:29.170 --> 04:32.757
And you press your finger on it
and then you taste your finger.

04:32.799 --> 04:37.095
Peppermint. Any time of day.
Or cherry.

04:37.137 --> 04:40.098
Wouldn't the pad get disgusting
after awhile?

04:40.140 --> 04:41.641
Disgusting how?

04:41.724 --> 04:44.644
I don't know. You keep touching it
with your filthy fingers.

04:44.686 --> 04:48.481
Couple of days that flavor pad's like
some mattress you find at the dump.

04:49.274 --> 04:51.651
You're right. It's no good.

04:59.492 --> 05:00.660
Tim.

05:00.744 --> 05:04.247
- Did you get your performance chart?
- Yeah.

05:04.330 --> 05:07.167
Well, look at mine. I don't get it.

05:07.208 --> 05:09.294
Good. Fair. Fair. Good.

05:09.335 --> 05:12.088
Then it falls into the red
in the focus department.

05:12.172 --> 05:15.884
Well, you know, Nick, that's because
you're a dreamer. You know?

05:15.967 --> 05:20.054
- I'm not a dreamer.
- You're not the most focused person.

05:20.138 --> 05:21.723
You're a dreamer.

05:21.806 --> 05:25.143
Yeah. I'm a dreamer?

05:25.185 --> 05:28.062
Hey, you want to feel something?
Come here.

05:28.146 --> 05:30.148
Sit in this chair. Come here.

05:30.231 --> 05:32.192
Okay.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.693
Check this out.

05:36.738 --> 05:37.739
Whoa.

05:37.822 --> 05:40.325
- Sit back.
- Oh, this is some chair!

05:40.408 --> 05:41.826
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.411
Feel this.

05:44.287 --> 05:46.247
What is that?

05:46.331 --> 05:48.875
- Lumbar support.
- That is good.

05:48.958 --> 05:53.171
- It's made especially for your spine.
- I like it.

05:53.213 --> 05:56.132
Comes with the office.
And the promotion.

05:56.216 --> 05:59.427
- Right.
- Thinking of buying a swimming pool?

05:59.511 --> 06:01.221
- What, are you kidding?
- I am.

06:01.304 --> 06:04.224
- Thinking bean-shaped.

06:04.307 --> 06:07.727
Expensive. Bean-shaped?

06:10.396 --> 06:12.857
Take a look at my performance chart.

06:12.941 --> 06:16.736
Look at your focus. It's way up there.
It's in the yellow.

06:16.778 --> 06:20.865
I'm telling you, you get your focus
even into the orange, just the orange...

06:20.907 --> 06:23.201
I guarantee you can have
a chair like that.

06:23.243 --> 06:25.120
- Really?
- And an office like this.

06:25.203 --> 06:27.747
And a piano-shaped pool
if that's what you want.

06:27.831 --> 06:30.625
It's all there for you.
All you got to do is focus.

06:30.708 --> 06:32.335
Just work a little bit harder.

06:32.419 --> 06:36.256
You can get bumped up to sandpaper
with me and the world opens up.

06:36.297 --> 06:39.509
You know what, man?
You could really sack out in this thing.

06:39.592 --> 06:42.971
I'm telling you, your numbers
aren't that bad. It's just focus.

06:43.054 --> 06:47.392
If you put together everything else, you
got a really strong thing going on...

06:49.978 --> 06:52.564
Nick. Nick!

06:54.190 --> 06:56.860
- I got to get back to work.
- Yeah.

06:56.943 --> 06:58.778
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.073
- Remember what I said.
- Focus.

07:02.115 --> 07:04.451
- Just get into orange.
- That's all I need.

07:04.534 --> 07:06.953
Don't even worry about yellow,
just orange.

07:13.543 --> 07:16.463
Do you ever just watch your hand?

07:16.504 --> 07:17.922
No.

07:17.964 --> 07:20.175
I was just looking at my hand today.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.012
It was like a separate thing.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.346
It was...

07:26.806 --> 07:29.142
picking up papers.

07:29.225 --> 07:33.396
It tapped on my desk.
It sat in my lap.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.982
- It's like...
- Sorry.

07:36.024 --> 07:38.318
It's like a...

07:38.401 --> 07:40.070
It's like a sidekick.

07:40.153 --> 07:43.323
My little ugly sidekick.
It was very odd.

08:01.424 --> 08:03.510
Eww.

08:03.593 --> 08:05.762
- Oh, oh!
- What?

08:05.845 --> 08:08.431
- Oh!
- What?!

08:08.515 --> 08:10.016
How about this?

08:10.100 --> 08:14.145
A spray can, see?
And you spray it on dog poo...

08:14.187 --> 08:17.023
and the poo disappears.

08:17.107 --> 08:18.983
- Disappears?
- Yes!

08:19.025 --> 08:21.027
Where does it go?

08:21.069 --> 08:23.071
Who knows? But the thing is...

08:23.154 --> 08:26.157
you come up with something
that gets rid of dog turds,

08:26.199 --> 08:29.536
you are home free, my friend.
Home free.

08:45.427 --> 08:46.761
What?

08:46.845 --> 08:48.263
Nothing.

08:49.889 --> 08:52.016
Liposuction.

08:54.853 --> 08:57.147
You mean, where they suck the fat out?

08:57.230 --> 08:59.315
There's a thing about it in here.

08:59.399 --> 09:02.026
You're fine. You don't need
to get fat sucked out.

09:02.068 --> 09:05.405
- If we had a little extra money...
- We don't have extra money.

09:05.447 --> 09:07.782
- We have a little.
- Not to get fat sucked out.

09:11.536 --> 09:12.537
Hello?

09:12.579 --> 09:16.124
- Timmy. Timmy, check this out.
- What?

09:16.207 --> 09:19.085
You know that invention of mine
that makes turds disappear?

09:20.378 --> 09:22.172
I got a name for it.

09:22.255 --> 09:24.299
Vapoorize.

09:24.382 --> 09:28.762
Just like vaporize only you add an "o"
so you got "poo" right in the middle.

09:28.845 --> 09:30.221
Yeah, I get it.

09:30.263 --> 09:33.600
Do you see how perfect it is?
Maybe even underline the poo.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.268
Va-poo-rize.

09:35.351 --> 09:37.270
- All right.
- Vapoorize.

09:37.312 --> 09:38.938
Goodbye.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.774
- Nick?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:40.857 --> 09:43.193
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

09:44.194 --> 09:46.446
Vapoorize.

09:48.782 --> 09:52.118
Next up, ladies
and gentlemen, Nathan Vanderpark.

09:52.202 --> 09:55.789
- Go ahead, Nathan.
- All right.

09:55.872 --> 09:59.167
- Here we go, Nathan. Here we go.

10:01.127 --> 10:02.962
- Almost.
- All right.

10:03.463 --> 10:05.965
- Nice try.
- All right, Nathan, let's...

10:06.007 --> 10:08.384
Close one.

10:08.468 --> 10:11.429
Oh! Come... all right.

10:11.471 --> 10:13.139
That's enough. Hey!

10:13.223 --> 10:15.016
Almost.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.228
- We'll get them next time, no problem.
- Good job.

10:18.311 --> 10:20.355
You know Dimitriov in research?

10:21.439 --> 10:22.732
- Dimitriov?
- Yeah.

10:22.816 --> 10:27.195
- Kind of big beard? Kind of strange?
- No.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.739
- I told him about my invention.
- What invention?

10:29.823 --> 10:31.199
Vapoorize!

10:31.282 --> 10:33.410
Nick, you got a cute name, that's it.

10:33.493 --> 10:36.830
It's not an invention. It's an idea.
It's nothing.

10:36.913 --> 10:39.916
Not according to Dimitriov.
He thinks I'm really on to something.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.977
- Bravo!
- Good stuff.

10:59.018 --> 11:01.187
- Good job.
- Good stuff.

11:01.271 --> 11:05.191
You know what? I love this tent.
There's not one bug.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.568
Guess what?

11:06.651 --> 11:09.279
I went over to Dimitriov's
a couple nights ago.

11:09.362 --> 11:11.322
We ran some experiments in his sink.

11:11.406 --> 11:14.159
- He's having a ball with this thing.
- What thing?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.202
You didn't tell Debbie
about my invention?

11:16.286 --> 11:19.247
No, sorry, I didn't.
Go ahead. This is great.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.000
Check it out.
It's a spray can, okay?

11:22.041 --> 11:24.002
And you spray it on dog poo...

11:24.043 --> 11:26.838
and the poo disappears.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.342
That is an awesome invention.
I mean, we could sure use it.

11:31.384 --> 11:35.388
It's not an invention. It's nothing.
I mean, how does it work?

11:35.472 --> 11:38.975
It's a spray can and you spray it on.

11:39.058 --> 11:41.227
- Exactly.
- Right?

11:41.311 --> 11:43.438
Yeah, I know.
But what makes it disappear?

11:43.521 --> 11:45.231
Things don't just disappear.

11:45.273 --> 11:48.026
I don't know, honey.
How does anything work?

11:48.068 --> 11:51.362
How does electricity work?
I think it's a great idea.

11:51.404 --> 11:53.990
So do l. I think it's really exciting.

11:54.074 --> 11:56.076
- You're nuts.

11:56.159 --> 11:57.577
Dessert, everybody?

11:57.660 --> 12:00.038
- I'm nuts. I'm crazy.
- You're crazy!

12:00.080 --> 12:03.166
Hey, I have an invention.
Honey, I have an invention.

12:03.249 --> 12:07.128
It's this button you press and
you sprout wings and you can fly.

12:07.212 --> 12:10.757
You can fly into outer space,
to the moon, to Jupiter if you like.

12:18.181 --> 12:20.225
He's doing so well.

12:20.266 --> 12:22.435
He's not doing anything.

12:22.519 --> 12:25.980
- Does he have any lines?
- No, honey, he's a tree.

12:26.773 --> 12:29.317
Three months of rehearsal.

12:31.444 --> 12:35.573
Dimitriov wants to know
if I want to take it to the next level.

12:35.615 --> 12:38.743
Four thousand bucks.
You want to go in with me, 50/50?

12:38.827 --> 12:42.497
I pray to God
you're kidding.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.290
- Your invention?
- Yeah.

12:44.374 --> 12:48.461
We've been working with dry ice.
We've got something amazing.

12:48.545 --> 12:49.796
Nick, forget it.

12:49.879 --> 12:54.467
No, wait a minute. $2,000.
We have that in our savings.

12:54.551 --> 12:55.760
Who knows?

12:55.802 --> 12:58.972
Shit doesn't just disappear.

12:59.055 --> 13:00.765
It has to go somewhere.

13:00.807 --> 13:05.770
And it's not an invention, it's an idea.
It's a pie in the sky idea.

13:05.854 --> 13:08.064
And I'll tell you,
as your best friend...

13:08.148 --> 13:11.568
I think you should
just pull out right now.

13:11.651 --> 13:14.446
Don't waste your money.
You're gonna regret it.

13:14.487 --> 13:15.947
"It's pie in the sky."

13:18.366 --> 13:22.036
Where are the kids?
What's happening?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.997
Honey?

13:27.167 --> 13:29.669
I have champagne glasses, too.

13:29.753 --> 13:31.212
All right!

13:31.296 --> 13:32.756
What's happening?

13:32.839 --> 13:36.593
Okay, let me get it for you.
I'll do everything.

13:36.676 --> 13:40.638
You just stay there and just relax
and get ready for the big stuff.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.641
- We got it.

13:43.683 --> 13:45.059
- Exciting.
- Watch this.

13:45.143 --> 13:48.855
I'm so glad you guys are here!
This is Dimitriov.

13:48.938 --> 13:51.691
- Meet our best friends in the universe.
- How do you do?

13:51.733 --> 13:54.527
Give Tim the flash, Big D.

13:54.569 --> 13:56.321
Okay. Here, take it.

13:56.362 --> 13:57.530
Goggles.

13:59.199 --> 14:01.159
Shine it right on her, buddy boy.

14:01.201 --> 14:02.827
"Her"?

14:22.639 --> 14:26.184
- You told me it would work and it did!
- Did you see that?!

14:26.267 --> 14:29.395
It works.
It works like a charm.

14:35.276 --> 14:36.903
Did you guys see that?

14:36.986 --> 14:40.031
Get a camera.
There's nothing to shoot!

14:40.115 --> 14:44.953
Spray some on my butt
because I shat my pants. Yeah!

14:45.036 --> 14:48.832
We are going to be so rich, Dimitriov!

14:48.915 --> 14:51.042
Vapoorize!

14:55.088 --> 14:57.257
God, we are going
to be so rich!

15:02.303 --> 15:04.722
No matter what kind of dog you have,
let's face it,

15:04.764 --> 15:06.641
they all gotta do their "business."

15:06.724 --> 15:08.560
Vapoorize!

15:08.601 --> 15:09.936
That's right!

15:10.019 --> 15:12.772
One spray: Problem solved.

15:12.814 --> 15:14.566
Is this some kind of video trick?

15:14.607 --> 15:15.942
No.

15:15.984 --> 15:18.903
It's the miracle spray.
One spray and doggy doo disappears.

15:18.945 --> 15:21.948
No fuss, no muss, no tools,
no robot arm...

15:22.031 --> 15:24.200
"How do I work it? I don't know!"

15:24.284 --> 15:26.286
- Too good to be true?
- No!

15:26.369 --> 15:28.621
Because life is tough enough.

15:28.663 --> 15:30.331
Now at stores everywhere.

15:30.331 --> 15:30.623
Now at stores everywhere.

16:16.628 --> 16:19.172
Now's a good time
to break the big news.

16:21.216 --> 16:26.179
I have decided to run for Congress.

16:26.262 --> 16:27.680
Congress.

16:29.224 --> 16:31.017
No, I'm serious.

16:31.101 --> 16:35.563
Yeah. I mean, not the big Congress,
of course, the little one.

16:35.647 --> 16:38.525
- "The little one."
- "The little one?"

16:38.608 --> 16:42.445
Yeah. Actually, it might be
the state senate. I can't remember.

16:42.529 --> 16:44.989
Anyway, I'm super excited...

16:45.031 --> 16:47.659
because we are so lucky...

16:47.742 --> 16:51.079
and we have so, so, so much.

16:51.162 --> 16:53.665
And I feel like
we should give something back.

16:53.706 --> 16:56.584
So, I've decided
I'm going to run for Congress

16:56.668 --> 16:58.962
or state senate or whatever.

16:59.045 --> 17:03.049
And my main platform...

17:03.133 --> 17:05.175
is going to be...

17:06.719 --> 17:08.430
the environment.

17:11.182 --> 17:12.851
State senate.

17:12.934 --> 17:15.728
Environment, like the whole environment?

17:15.770 --> 17:20.483
Yeah. I believe in all environments
and I'm going to say it.

17:21.734 --> 17:24.738
And now for dessert.

17:24.820 --> 17:26.865
Flan!

17:26.948 --> 17:29.576
- Flan! Oh, boy!
- Whoo!

17:29.659 --> 17:33.705
- Come on, kids, flan time!
- Get down here, the flan's here!

17:33.788 --> 17:35.790
Flan, kids! Flan!

17:35.874 --> 17:37.459
I love flan. Do you?

17:37.542 --> 17:38.793
What is flan?

17:38.877 --> 17:40.962
My God, you're in for such a treat.

17:41.045 --> 17:44.090
- You don't know flan?
- Eat your flan, buddy. Kids, flan!

17:44.174 --> 17:47.427
- Guys, flan's on the table!
- Flan!

17:47.469 --> 17:48.762
Flan! Flan!

17:48.803 --> 17:52.390
Flan! Yay, flan! Flan!

17:52.474 --> 17:54.267
What's flan?

17:54.350 --> 17:57.145
"Jasper and Amos
shine the flashlight into the hole.

17:57.228 --> 18:01.733
"Staring up at them, tied and gagged,
was Louie the Grouch."

18:01.816 --> 18:04.277
It's getting exciting, isn't it?

18:04.319 --> 18:07.405
Boy, that flan was good.

18:07.447 --> 18:09.032
I wish we had flan.

18:17.123 --> 18:18.166
Dad?

18:18.249 --> 18:19.918
Yeah?

18:19.959 --> 18:22.337
Why are we getting the little,
itty-bitty pool?

18:22.420 --> 18:23.880
It's not a little itty-bitty.

18:23.963 --> 18:27.842
The square one's little itty-bitty.
We're getting the bean-shaped model.

18:27.926 --> 18:29.761
A little itty-bitty bean.

18:29.803 --> 18:34.015
It's not a little, itty-bitty bean.
It's an average-sized bean, Mikey.

18:34.099 --> 18:35.558
And I got news for you.

18:35.642 --> 18:39.687
There are kids in the world
who'd walk 50 miles through quicksand

18:39.771 --> 18:42.440
just to stick a toe in your pool.

18:42.482 --> 18:45.318
And I got news for you about beans too.

18:45.360 --> 18:49.280
Some kids'd eat beans because they've
had nothing to eat their whole life,

18:49.322 --> 18:51.324
but leaves and bark and roots.

18:51.408 --> 18:55.453
And I guarantee you, none of them has
ever heard of your big, show-off flan,

18:55.537 --> 19:00.542
or flan or whatever you want to call it
that you got to have every night.

19:05.463 --> 19:09.175
Two thousand dollars.
That's all it would've taken.

19:09.259 --> 19:12.595
- It's okay, honey.
- Dad's just having a meltdown.

19:12.679 --> 19:14.931
Good night. Sleep tight.

19:15.640 --> 19:15.682
- I don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

19:15.682 --> 19:18.017
- I don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

19:18.101 --> 19:20.645
- Try different breakfast foods.
- I like pancakes.

19:20.728 --> 19:23.523
- Tomorrow we'll have pancakes.
- Fine.

19:28.820 --> 19:30.822
I don't want any more cereal.

19:30.864 --> 19:33.950
Eat up, otherwise you don't
get to play with Corky, okay?

19:39.789 --> 19:41.499
- What?
- Nothing.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.210
Why are you always asking "what"?

19:44.252 --> 19:46.588
- I'm not always asking "what."
- Yes, you are.

19:46.671 --> 19:48.214
It's true, Dad, you are.

19:48.298 --> 19:50.759
Well, because I know there's something.

19:50.842 --> 19:55.263
- And you know exactly what it is.
- Then why do you always say "nothing"?

19:55.346 --> 19:57.724
- Corky!
- Hold Lula's hand, honey.

20:00.935 --> 20:03.229
- Corky!

20:03.354 --> 20:04.898
So beautiful.

20:04.981 --> 20:07.400
Such a great horse, Corky.

20:07.442 --> 20:09.527
Who's a good boy?

20:09.611 --> 20:13.698
Corky's a sweet and gentle horse
and me and the kids love him.

20:13.782 --> 20:16.868
Corky happens to shit
the size of a breadbasket

20:16.910 --> 20:19.954
in our yard every day
when he comes to visit.

21:00.370 --> 21:02.455
What are you doing?

21:02.539 --> 21:05.125
Nothing. Nothing at all.

21:05.208 --> 21:11.005
I'm just throwing away some more
completely useless inventions.

21:12.715 --> 21:15.593
For chrissakes, Debbie, light?
Light?! Come on!

21:15.635 --> 21:17.971
Come on! This was shit.

21:18.012 --> 21:21.975
You think Edison would've looked up
from his workbench at some shit spray?

21:22.016 --> 21:23.977
Yes. Yes, I do.

21:24.018 --> 21:27.439
Because, you see, a good invention
is a good invention!

21:27.480 --> 21:30.358
I got news for you, sister.
Edison ain't looking up.

21:30.442 --> 21:33.778
Sister. Sister?!

21:33.820 --> 21:35.196
I'm calling you sister.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.866
You should be so lucky
to be my sister.

21:37.949 --> 21:39.784
She knows what she's talking about.

21:39.826 --> 21:41.661
Windtalker, or whatever her name is.

21:41.745 --> 21:46.249
- Do not call her that. It's Windsong.
- Windsong. My mistake. Windsong.

21:46.332 --> 21:46.750
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.169
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

21:49.252 --> 21:52.297
How's everybody doing?

21:56.718 --> 21:58.470
What a day, right?

21:58.511 --> 22:01.306
My God! Can you believe
the coffee that makes?

22:01.347 --> 22:04.100
I knew you'd love it.
Let's go, tiger.

22:07.645 --> 22:10.857
Look who's here, will you please?

22:11.566 --> 22:13.818
Look who's here. It's okay, poopie.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.988
Have you been stealing apples again,
you little rascal?

22:17.072 --> 22:20.492
Listen, and I want you to be honest,
has Corky become a nuisance?

22:20.533 --> 22:21.868
- No.
- Not one bit.

22:21.951 --> 22:24.162
Natalie says, "Keep the corral closed."

22:24.204 --> 22:27.540
But Corky's so crazy about your apples,
I don't know what to do.

22:27.624 --> 22:29.959
No more apples for you.
No more apples...

22:30.043 --> 22:34.005
I can't stop him. He loves your apples.
Are you sure he's not a problem?

22:34.047 --> 22:36.382
- Positive.
- You guys are so fantastic.

22:36.424 --> 22:39.302
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

22:39.302 --> 22:39.719
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

22:55.443 --> 22:57.821
I got something for you.
I'll be right back.

22:57.904 --> 23:00.490
- Nick, no. Please.
- Yes. You'll love it.

23:00.573 --> 23:02.909
You don't have to get me anything else.

23:10.959 --> 23:12.377
When I hit it big,

23:12.419 --> 23:16.005
everyone said I should buy a house
in Beverly Hills, Bel Air or Malibu.

23:16.089 --> 23:18.883
"Why you spending money
on a mansion in the Valley?"

23:18.925 --> 23:23.054
But I love my neighborhood, and being
across the street from my best friend.

23:23.138 --> 23:26.099
Do you see how it moves in the wind?
That's what I love.

23:27.767 --> 23:31.396
It flaps different than cheaper fabric.
Do you notice that?

23:32.564 --> 23:34.774
- Yeah.
- And it makes you feel better.

23:34.858 --> 23:39.738
Nice fabric makes you feel better!
It's mind-blowing, isn't it?

23:39.779 --> 23:42.115
Nick, you buy us too much.

23:42.198 --> 23:46.619
Too much?! You're my best friend.
Nice things make life nicer.

23:48.538 --> 23:51.958
All right, let's take another look
at that follow-through.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.920
I want the head down.

23:59.257 --> 24:00.633
That is nice, Nicky.

24:00.717 --> 24:02.761
- Right?
- Very nice.

24:02.802 --> 24:05.513
God Almighty, Mr. Dingman.

24:05.597 --> 24:08.266
Nick? Can I talk to you for a second?

24:10.977 --> 24:12.520
Just take a second.

24:14.647 --> 24:17.150
Can't it just be us?
You and me playing golf?

24:17.233 --> 24:19.277
It's just, this is costing a fortune.

24:19.319 --> 24:22.030
Cut it out with this money thing.
It means nothing to me.

24:22.113 --> 24:23.364
Let's just enjoy it.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.118
Why can't you come with us?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.995
Because Daddy has to go to work.

24:29.079 --> 24:31.498
You'll have a great time
at Aunt Nancy's.

24:31.581 --> 24:34.459
Aunt Windsong, and you know that.

24:35.293 --> 24:37.378
It's Aunt Windsong now.

24:42.300 --> 24:46.137
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Really. Why do this?

24:46.179 --> 24:50.100
Because I have to do this.
We have to do this.

24:50.183 --> 24:52.143
Something has to change.

24:52.185 --> 24:55.188
I can't look at you,
I can't look across the street.

24:55.271 --> 24:57.524
I'm running out of places to look.

24:58.858 --> 25:01.361
The pool people
come tomorrow.

25:14.624 --> 25:17.544
Just wait and see this, Dad.

25:20.713 --> 25:22.674
Whoa! You the man.

25:22.757 --> 25:24.551
- You're the man.
- Yeah!

25:58.835 --> 26:00.920
Hey, Timmy, check this out!

26:01.004 --> 26:02.422
Yeah!

26:02.464 --> 26:04.883
Yah! Yah!

26:09.345 --> 26:11.014
Yah!

26:15.310 --> 26:17.437
Mr. Dingman!

26:17.520 --> 26:20.315
Mr. Parmenter wants to see you!
Section 1 1!

26:21.441 --> 26:24.402
You wanted to see me?

26:24.444 --> 26:26.529
You all right?

26:26.613 --> 26:27.655
What?

26:27.739 --> 26:30.033
You seem distracted!

26:30.950 --> 26:32.285
- What?
- Come on!

26:32.368 --> 26:35.413
Your performance chart's
pretty good until here.

26:35.497 --> 26:38.833
And then your focus
nosedives into the red.

26:38.917 --> 26:40.668
You see?

26:40.752 --> 26:45.006
Now, is there anything that happened
around here...

26:46.508 --> 26:49.177
you might like to talk about?

26:49.260 --> 26:50.386
No.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.597
- You sure?
- Yeah. No.

26:53.807 --> 26:55.433
Any reason?

26:55.517 --> 26:57.477
Reason? No, I can't think of...

26:57.519 --> 27:01.189
Any reason at all?

27:01.272 --> 27:06.277
No. No reason. No.
I mean, nothing I can think of.

27:06.361 --> 27:08.238
I mean...

27:08.321 --> 27:12.450
you know, other than every day
I get into my little shit-box car

27:12.534 --> 27:16.121
and there he is,
with the wind in his hair...

27:16.204 --> 27:18.665
on his great big shiny horse.

27:18.748 --> 27:23.294
And I drive off to do what?
To make sandpaper.

27:24.212 --> 27:27.382
To make paper with sand on it.

27:29.592 --> 27:33.555
I'd love to see you try to turn your
weasely little mouth into a fake smile,

27:33.638 --> 27:35.557
day after day after day...

27:35.640 --> 27:38.518
while waving toodly-fucking-do
to your best friend,

27:38.601 --> 27:42.230
who's rearing up on a big white horse
like he's the Lone Ranger.

27:42.313 --> 27:44.816
Then I'd like to see
your performance chart,

27:44.858 --> 27:47.694
you beady-eyed
little shrimp-boat bastard!

27:49.863 --> 27:51.990
Is that a reason?

27:55.702 --> 27:59.038
I mean, is that a reason?

28:19.559 --> 28:21.227
Hi.

28:21.770 --> 28:26.608
I don't really drink,
but my family just left me

28:26.691 --> 28:29.819
and I got fired and I want a drink.

28:29.903 --> 28:35.241
So, if you could just give me whatever
you'd have if you wanted to drink.

28:36.576 --> 28:37.952
Please.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.751
Harsh.

28:47.754 --> 28:49.422
Abandoned.

28:49.756 --> 28:51.841
Fired.

28:53.927 --> 28:56.262
It's harsh, man.

28:59.432 --> 29:03.103
Know what the best job
I ever got fired from was?

29:06.606 --> 29:08.942
Pretzel kiosk.

29:08.983 --> 29:12.862
Afternoon shift. Just loved it,
don't know why, just did.

29:12.946 --> 29:15.281
Could be the apron, who the hell knows?

29:15.365 --> 29:18.493
Or maybe the feeling of power you get
when there's a crowd.

29:18.576 --> 29:21.121
One hand rolls dough,
ties those babies off.

29:21.204 --> 29:26.459
The other hand maybe works the soda,
refills the mustard. It's quite a thing.

29:26.543 --> 29:28.086
I'll tell you a secret.

29:28.169 --> 29:31.506
If a pretzel is a quality pretzel,
you don't need salt.

29:31.589 --> 29:33.258
It's just a fact.

29:40.014 --> 29:41.433
How come?

29:42.225 --> 29:45.353
Your family up
and blew out of town on you?

29:46.813 --> 29:50.066
Thank you, but I don't really feel like
talking about it right now.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.777
- Thank you.
- Okay.

29:52.819 --> 29:55.572
So, how come you got canned?

29:57.240 --> 29:59.909
It's a whole different topic.

30:01.077 --> 30:02.996
I just blew up.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.500
Good for you, man. Good for you.
Good for you.

30:08.334 --> 30:11.171
- Who at?
- I blew up at my boss.

30:11.212 --> 30:13.923
Right on, brother. I hear you.

30:14.007 --> 30:16.426
Man, I hear you!

30:16.509 --> 30:19.679
What'd you go and blow up
at your boss for?

30:20.346 --> 30:25.310
You know, it's like
a long, complicated story.

30:25.351 --> 30:29.522
Well, that is sensational.
I'm the J-Man, by the way.

30:30.815 --> 30:32.317
- Tim.
- Tim.

30:32.358 --> 30:34.027
Ike.

30:34.110 --> 30:36.029
Another round, please.

30:36.071 --> 30:39.324
Something fruity
for me and my friend, Tim.

30:39.365 --> 30:41.326
On the J-Man.

30:42.410 --> 30:44.370
Okay, Tim...

30:44.871 --> 30:48.708
just let it tumble out
like circus freaks, man.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.460
I'm here for you.

30:50.543 --> 30:53.254
The J-Man is zeroed in, okay?

30:54.130 --> 30:55.673
Go.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.636
Go.

30:59.719 --> 31:03.515
Well, I have this friend.
He's my best friend.

31:03.556 --> 31:06.267
I love the guy.
I mean, it's like we're, you know...

31:06.351 --> 31:09.354
Our families do everything together.

31:09.395 --> 31:12.565
- Used to go to work together every day.
- Keep it coming.

31:12.649 --> 31:15.110
And he'd have these stupid...

31:15.193 --> 31:17.570
He'd have these stupid ideas.

31:17.612 --> 31:19.697
Open your heart. Open your heart.

31:19.781 --> 31:22.033
Where does it come from?

31:22.075 --> 31:23.701
Shit.

31:23.743 --> 31:25.370
It's all from shit.

31:25.453 --> 31:28.415
You know who you are?
You're like that guy...

31:28.498 --> 31:30.750
Che, Che something.

31:30.834 --> 31:35.004
- "Che something"?
- Up with the people. People power.

31:35.088 --> 31:38.174
Or the kid that stole a chicken
with the golden eggs.

31:38.258 --> 31:39.884
What a fantastic chicken.

31:39.926 --> 31:43.096
Who's for the giant? Nobody.
You hear what I'm saying.

31:43.179 --> 31:44.722
You're the hero.

31:44.806 --> 31:47.100
Forget Che! You're like Robin Hood.

31:47.183 --> 31:49.477
- Robin Hood? Really?
- Listen to me.

31:49.561 --> 31:53.148
Listen to me. Life's unfair.
It's a raw deal planet, Jack.

31:53.231 --> 31:55.900
You, my little dumbbell friend,
are Mr. Everyman

31:55.942 --> 32:00.071
and you don't even know it, which makes
you like the grand turbo Mr. Everyman.

32:00.155 --> 32:01.531
Honestly?

32:01.614 --> 32:02.907
Come on.

32:02.949 --> 32:06.077
You're like a great big dimwit.
You know that. Fantastic.

32:06.161 --> 32:07.662
Everyman Dimwit.

32:07.746 --> 32:11.416
That stinking family across the street.
Who wouldn't feel like you?

32:14.085 --> 32:17.130
I like you.
I'm glad I came in here.

32:17.213 --> 32:18.631
You know that?

32:18.673 --> 32:22.302
Ringlets! Give me a break.
Let me tell you a little story.

32:22.385 --> 32:23.928
When I was maybe 1 0,

32:24.012 --> 32:28.558
there was this kid across the street,
Ernie "Nice Kid."

32:28.641 --> 32:32.771
Ernie had everything.
Only kid around with a BB gun, okay?

32:32.812 --> 32:35.857
So one night I see
the whole family drive off.

32:35.940 --> 32:40.195
What'd I do? I sneak across the street
and find the BB gun.

32:40.278 --> 32:44.741
I squeeze off maybe five, ten pot shots
at the windows...

32:44.824 --> 32:46.659
Hello. In my house.

32:46.701 --> 32:49.954
- In your house?
- Yes, you got...

32:49.996 --> 32:51.831
You squoze off to your house?

32:51.873 --> 32:54.334
You got it.
Next morning my old man gets up,

32:54.417 --> 32:58.129
sees all these little BB holes
in our windows.

32:58.171 --> 33:01.466
He marches across the street,
bangs on the door and Tim,

33:01.508 --> 33:03.426
my little bozo friend,

33:03.510 --> 33:07.847
things changed big time
over there in Ernieville.

33:12.519 --> 33:15.355
That's what you got to do!

33:15.438 --> 33:17.482
- What?
- Shake things up.

33:17.524 --> 33:19.567
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

33:19.651 --> 33:24.364
Make them think of something besides
the temperature in that candy-ass pool.

33:26.741 --> 33:30.203
- Shit, what time is it?
- What kind of question is that?

33:31.162 --> 33:34.124
I got to get back!
They can't build the pool!

33:34.958 --> 33:37.335
Ike, cab...

33:37.377 --> 33:39.504
on the J-Man.

33:39.546 --> 33:43.216
- Come on!

33:50.014 --> 33:51.015
Excuse me!

33:54.644 --> 33:56.062
Sir! Sir!

33:56.104 --> 33:57.689
You have to stop, please.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.441
Here they come!

33:59.524 --> 34:01.401
- Whoo!
- Hi, Mom!

34:01.484 --> 34:03.695
Digging, no. We can't pay for the pool.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.239
We don't... we can't pay for the pool.

34:06.281 --> 34:08.699
No, no. Stop! Sir!
No mas!

34:08.742 --> 34:11.703
- Sir, I'll talk to the office.

34:12.203 --> 34:14.038
Good afternoon, Mr. Tim.

34:14.080 --> 34:18.460
- Hi.
- You look really, really wonderful.

34:18.543 --> 34:22.213
And here is something from
your great friends across the street

34:22.255 --> 34:24.924
while your wonderful family is away.

34:33.766 --> 34:37.478
"Thought you might enjoy a taste
from our newly acquired vineyard."

35:01.002 --> 35:05.882
You got to shake things up.
Over there, man. Shake them up.

35:13.098 --> 35:15.183
Carousel of dreams.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.479
Casa Corky.

35:20.522 --> 35:22.273
Casa Corky.

35:25.693 --> 35:27.487
Incredible.

35:27.529 --> 35:29.239
Incredible hedge work.

35:36.621 --> 35:38.623
You got to shake things up.

35:38.706 --> 35:40.834
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

35:40.917 --> 35:44.462
Shake things up.
Shake them up.

36:07.193 --> 36:08.820
Huh?

36:26.045 --> 36:27.088
Corky.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.009
My God. How is this possible?

36:31.050 --> 36:33.762
How could a little arrow
kill a big horse?

36:33.845 --> 36:36.139
Come on, Corky.
Corky, come on, come on.

36:36.222 --> 36:39.309
It's just a little arrow.
Come on, Corky.

36:39.392 --> 36:40.810
Giddy up, boy.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.021
Corky. Giddy up. Giddy up.

36:43.104 --> 36:45.064
Corky.

36:47.108 --> 36:49.277
Okay, Corky.

36:50.278 --> 36:52.572
Come on, boy. One, two.

36:52.614 --> 36:54.657
Come on.

36:54.741 --> 36:56.367
Shit.

36:56.451 --> 36:58.953
Shit. God.

37:00.955 --> 37:03.458
Come on, Corky.

38:01.474 --> 38:03.101
Hey.

38:06.729 --> 38:08.982
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

38:09.065 --> 38:12.193
Car return.
How's that for service?

38:12.277 --> 38:16.573
I'd probably still be driving a limo
if it wasn't for the hat.

38:16.656 --> 38:17.657
Hats.

38:17.741 --> 38:20.118
Hats make my head itch.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.288
- What time is it?
- You got a time hang-up, don't you?

38:23.329 --> 38:24.831
Oh, God.

38:24.914 --> 38:27.459
- Look at me.
- I was thinking the same thing.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.377
You are one big stinking pig, Tim.

38:29.461 --> 38:31.129
- How'd you get my keys?
- Keys?

38:31.171 --> 38:34.632
The J-Man don't usually need keys,
my little dumbbell pal.

38:34.674 --> 38:38.720
So, that's the place?

38:38.803 --> 38:42.515
Look at it. All from shit?
I see what you mean.

38:42.599 --> 38:46.060
I don't even live here and that place
is pulling my testicles up.

38:46.144 --> 38:48.980
I mean, literally,
they're actually coming up.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.149
You ever get that?

38:51.191 --> 38:52.692
I killed his horse.

38:52.734 --> 38:55.403
- What?
- I killed his horse.

38:55.487 --> 38:58.448
That story you were telling
about shaking things up...

38:58.531 --> 39:00.992
I went over there and
I shot this bow and arrow,

39:01.034 --> 39:04.579
and I shot at my house
and I hit his horse.

39:04.662 --> 39:06.372
He was eating apples in my yard.

39:06.456 --> 39:10.293
There was a hole because we were going
to have a pool and I buried him in it.

39:10.376 --> 39:13.671
- Well, now.
- Daddy! We're home!

39:13.713 --> 39:15.090
No!

39:19.719 --> 39:21.179
It's my family.

39:21.221 --> 39:22.514
- Hide!
- Hide?

39:22.555 --> 39:24.432
Hide! Hide.

39:24.516 --> 39:28.228
- Hide? Can't I just mosey off?
- No! Don't mosey off.

39:28.311 --> 39:30.688
No, you can't mosey off.
They'll see you!

39:30.730 --> 39:33.066
- So?
- So? So, what are you doing here?

39:33.108 --> 39:35.193
Who are you?
You're some guy from a bar.

39:35.276 --> 39:39.447
What's wrong with...?
I'm the J-Man, bringing your car back.

39:39.531 --> 39:41.032
Daddy!

39:41.074 --> 39:42.951
- Hey, tiger!
- Daddy!

39:43.034 --> 39:46.329
- Hey, peanut.
- We all really missed you.

39:46.413 --> 39:49.958
You look terrible.
Honey, one question.

39:50.041 --> 39:53.169
What is at the heart of everything?
What I'm asking you is:

39:53.253 --> 39:56.589
What is at the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

39:56.673 --> 39:59.717
Do you know what the answer is?
Self-love.

39:59.759 --> 40:02.971
Windsong told me that I have been
hating myself for resenting you.

40:03.054 --> 40:06.808
And you've been resenting yourself
for passing up on a big opportunity.

40:06.891 --> 40:10.228
What we need to do
is we need to focus on what we have.

40:11.855 --> 40:14.566
Hey! Oh, hey!

40:14.649 --> 40:16.943
This is... This guy...

40:16.985 --> 40:18.737
Honey...

40:18.778 --> 40:22.365
this is...
This man is the man...

40:23.533 --> 40:26.035
who was in the bathroom.
I didn't tell you.

40:30.206 --> 40:34.586
Honey... something happened
while you were gone, something bad.

40:34.627 --> 40:36.129
What?

40:36.171 --> 40:37.797
I'll take it from here, Tim.

40:39.299 --> 40:41.259
Mrs. Dingman...

40:41.301 --> 40:44.012
I'm Elmo Carp, pool rep.

40:44.095 --> 40:48.850
Your husband and I were up here
discussing your swimming pool options.

40:48.933 --> 40:50.810
- Swimming pool options?
- Yes.

40:50.894 --> 40:52.937
You see, we dug it,
we had to fill it back in.

40:52.979 --> 40:56.524
We're sorry as heck.
Where do we go from here?

40:56.608 --> 40:59.444
That's the point we were at
when you barged in.

40:59.486 --> 41:02.405
I don't understand.
Fill it back in?

41:02.489 --> 41:05.700
So you mean we're not getting a pool?

41:05.784 --> 41:08.995
No, sonny boy, I'm afraid not.
Too many gosh darn pipes.

41:09.079 --> 41:10.455
- Pipes?
- Yes.

41:10.497 --> 41:12.749
Underground pipes in your yard,

41:12.832 --> 41:17.921
but I've intruded enough
on your little family reunion here.

41:18.004 --> 41:19.714
I'll be on my way.

41:19.798 --> 41:22.675
And thanks for filthying up
your clothes,

41:22.717 --> 41:24.677
helping me fill in the big hole, Tim.

41:24.719 --> 41:27.972
Ma'am, your husband's
got the back of a coal miner.

41:28.014 --> 41:31.476
I know because I've mined coal.
See you.

41:39.984 --> 41:42.070
Something's happened to Corky.

41:42.153 --> 41:43.780
- What?
- Corky?

41:43.863 --> 41:46.324
- Have you seen Corky?
- I haven't seen Corky.

41:46.366 --> 41:48.243
- Corky's gone?
- Have you seen Corky?

41:48.326 --> 41:50.328
- I have not seen Corky.
- That's what I mean.

41:50.412 --> 41:52.914
We've been looking and looking.
Where could he be?

41:52.997 --> 41:56.501
- A great big horse, where?
- Nick, a horse can't just disappear.

41:56.543 --> 41:58.753
- He's got to be somewhere.
- Yeah, but where?

41:58.837 --> 42:02.006
Where? Where?
The kids are a mess.

42:02.048 --> 42:04.676
Wish me luck.

42:06.010 --> 42:08.221
Corky!

42:08.304 --> 42:10.807
Corky, come on!

42:12.809 --> 42:15.979
Good afternoon.
My name is Natalie Vanderpark.

42:16.062 --> 42:18.398
I'm running for state senate
in your district.

42:18.481 --> 42:20.567
So I thought l'd
canvass the neighborhood

42:20.650 --> 42:22.527
and introduce myself to everyone.

42:22.569 --> 42:24.404
Who it is, Mable?

42:24.446 --> 42:27.490
It's that woman running
for state senate, Carl.

42:28.158 --> 42:32.328
The shit lady? No way.
We're going with Shaunessey.

42:32.412 --> 42:33.955
Your opponent Shaunessey,

42:34.038 --> 42:36.624
he asked a good question
on the radio this morning.

42:36.708 --> 42:38.126
And what question was that?

42:38.209 --> 42:42.589
Well, didn't your husband get loaded
making turds disappear?

42:42.630 --> 42:46.843
My husband invented Vapoorize,
if that's what you're referring to.

42:46.926 --> 42:49.429
That's what Shaunessey
was talking about.

42:49.512 --> 42:53.391
Where do all them turds go?
I mean, they got to be somewhere.

42:53.433 --> 42:55.935
First they're here,
then they're not here,

42:55.977 --> 42:57.479
and then they disappear.

42:57.562 --> 43:01.441
Where does the turd go to?
Really, tell me now.

43:25.006 --> 43:26.466
So long, everybody.

43:26.508 --> 43:28.760
- Bye, have a good day at work.
- Bye, Daddy.

43:28.843 --> 43:32.430
- Bye, honey.
- Good luck at the salt mines, Dad.

43:37.143 --> 43:38.645
Where am I going?

43:38.728 --> 43:40.939
Wait. Timmy, wait!

43:41.022 --> 43:43.608
Wait! God.

43:43.650 --> 43:45.318
Timmy, I can't find him.

43:45.402 --> 43:47.862
I've been looking all night
and he's nowhere.

43:47.946 --> 43:50.198
I know he's just a horse, but...

43:50.281 --> 43:52.117
Corky.

43:52.158 --> 43:55.870
Corky! Where are you,
my Corky boy?

44:00.500 --> 44:03.086
God, look at me.
This is crazy.

44:03.169 --> 44:05.964
Will you pass these out
down at 3M for me?

44:07.549 --> 44:12.595
I found some grooming hairs
in his tail brush.

44:12.679 --> 44:14.639
My God.

44:14.722 --> 44:17.183
- $50,000?
- It's pennies!

44:17.225 --> 44:21.312
It's pennies. Who cares?
Corky's my pal.

44:22.147 --> 44:28.111
He's my pal and I'd pay $50,000 to
find you if you were lost, wouldn't l?

44:28.194 --> 44:30.989
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't l?!

44:36.161 --> 44:38.121
- Okay.

44:38.204 --> 44:40.749
All right.
It's going to be okay.

44:40.749 --> 44:41.207
All right.
It's going to be okay.

45:13.782 --> 45:15.533
Are you insane?

45:15.575 --> 45:19.370
That is the most selfish thing
I ever heard in my life.

45:19.412 --> 45:23.541
The guy loves you, man.
You'd be killing your best friend.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.086
You killed his horse, right?
You killed his horse.

45:26.169 --> 45:29.380
Now you want to tell him?
You tell him.

45:29.422 --> 45:31.925
What about this?
We move the horse someplace else.

45:31.966 --> 45:36.221
I find it, I get the reward.
I'm bending over backwards here.

45:36.304 --> 45:38.389
How do we move a horse?

45:38.431 --> 45:40.725
We dig him up. We haul him off.

45:40.767 --> 45:44.813
No, I mean...
without anybody seeing us.

45:44.896 --> 45:46.731
You ever hear of night?

45:46.773 --> 45:49.734
What about the noise?
My family's right there.

45:49.776 --> 45:51.653
I don't want them to...

45:51.736 --> 45:53.905
You don't move the horse, I do,

45:53.947 --> 45:56.241
while you and your family
are enjoying nature,

45:56.324 --> 45:58.410
down at my cabin on the lake.

45:58.493 --> 46:01.579
- You have a cabin on the lake?
- What?

46:01.663 --> 46:03.665
You think I didn't have a childhood?

46:03.748 --> 46:07.168
Bunk beds, hiking trails, hooty owls.

46:08.586 --> 46:10.755
You can move a horse by yourself?

46:10.839 --> 46:14.134
For 50 grand.

46:18.346 --> 46:20.932
But I will say this:

46:21.808 --> 46:25.395
Knowing what I happen to know
about things buried,

46:25.478 --> 46:27.272
the sooner the better.

46:27.355 --> 46:30.024
- Hey, Deb?
- Mmm-hmm?

46:30.108 --> 46:32.360
How'd you like to go
to a nice cabin on a lake?

46:32.444 --> 46:35.155
- Cabin on a lake?
- Yeah.

46:35.238 --> 46:39.159
This guy at work offered his cabin.
It's supposed to be really nice.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.662
- Who at work offered you this?
- Jackameyer.

46:42.704 --> 46:46.166
Jack... Jack Jackameyer.

46:46.249 --> 46:50.128
It's an hour from here
and it has all sorts of wildlife...

46:50.170 --> 46:52.464
and hooty owls and stuff.

46:52.505 --> 46:54.507
Hiking trails.

46:55.592 --> 46:58.595
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

46:58.678 --> 47:02.599
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

47:02.682 --> 47:06.060
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

47:34.506 --> 47:36.674
Pretty incredible, huh?

47:36.716 --> 47:39.886
Whoa!
Watch out. It's okay.

47:39.969 --> 47:41.346
What a spot.

47:41.429 --> 47:44.099
What do you mean, "what a spot"?
I mean, where...

47:46.810 --> 47:50.355
He said it's just down at the end
of the private driveway.

47:50.438 --> 47:53.399
What private driveway?
This isn't a private driveway.

47:53.441 --> 47:56.403
This is pretty private, honey.
I mean, this is great.

47:56.486 --> 47:57.862
T alk about secluded.

47:57.904 --> 48:00.198
We've walked, like, a mile.

48:00.240 --> 48:03.410
It's not a mile, honey. It seems longer
because it's so beautiful.

48:03.493 --> 48:05.870
Tim!

48:05.954 --> 48:09.165
- Mommy, where's Daddy?
- I don't know, honey.

48:09.249 --> 48:11.835
- I'm thirsty.
- Okay.

48:12.919 --> 48:16.881
- Tim!
- Whoo! I found it!

48:16.965 --> 48:20.760
It's a little sloping incline
down to the...

48:24.139 --> 48:26.391
This is it?

48:26.474 --> 48:28.560
You bet this is it.

48:29.436 --> 48:32.397
This is...
This is wild, huh, kids?

48:32.439 --> 48:36.109
Kind of like a... Like an old
gingerbread house in the woods.

48:36.192 --> 48:37.569
Where's the lake?

48:38.653 --> 48:41.698
I'll tell you what. Why don't
we check out the bunkhouse, okay?

48:41.781 --> 48:45.535
And then you guys can have a contest to
see who finds the lake first, all right?

48:45.618 --> 48:48.371
Winner gets 50 cents.
50 cents. Come on.

48:48.455 --> 48:49.914
Let's check it out.

48:55.628 --> 48:58.173
Okay. Weird smell.

48:58.256 --> 49:00.300
Let's hold our noses. Come on.

49:01.426 --> 49:03.219
It's okay, Mikey, come on in.

49:04.846 --> 49:06.514
- My God.
- It's okay.

49:06.598 --> 49:08.558
Just a little critter. Just...

49:08.641 --> 49:11.811
Don't touch it. He's dead.

49:16.524 --> 49:21.321
Under no circumstances
is this a lake.

49:24.616 --> 49:26.284
Maybe there's a tide.

49:26.326 --> 49:29.204
No one could ever find this lake.

49:29.287 --> 49:32.165
Congratulations,
you saved yourself 50 cents.

49:41.341 --> 49:43.259
What is that?

50:05.532 --> 50:06.866
Tim?

50:06.950 --> 50:08.952
Yes?

50:10.120 --> 50:11.246
Tim?

50:12.205 --> 50:13.706
Yes?

50:13.748 --> 50:15.083
You're Tim?

50:15.166 --> 50:17.252
Yes, I'm Tim.

50:17.335 --> 50:19.546
The J-Man says, "Come quick."

50:19.629 --> 50:21.172
Come quick?

50:21.256 --> 50:23.383
Yeah, come quick.

50:23.466 --> 50:25.176
That's it.

50:25.218 --> 50:29.722
Now, when you see the J-Man,
you tell him we're even.

50:29.806 --> 50:34.102
And Bosco says,
"Up your ass with Mobil gas."

50:35.353 --> 50:36.521
Okay.

50:36.604 --> 50:38.565
What will you tell the J-Man?

50:38.648 --> 50:43.528
I'm going to tell him that Bosco
says we're even

50:43.570 --> 50:45.530
and up your ass with Mobil gas.

50:45.572 --> 50:47.073
Mobil gas.

50:54.622 --> 50:57.083
It's Jack's neighbor,
he needs some help.

50:57.167 --> 50:59.169
Neighbor?

50:59.252 --> 51:01.713
That's right, Bosco,
he's as nice as Jack,

51:01.796 --> 51:04.299
but his car's stuck
so I'm going to help him, okay?

51:04.382 --> 51:06.217
I didn't see any neighbors.

51:06.259 --> 51:08.428
What? You think Bosco would lie?

51:08.511 --> 51:11.931
Why would Bosco lie?
I'll go get him right now if you want.

51:12.015 --> 51:14.017
Okay.

51:14.934 --> 51:16.436
- Okay?
- Yes.

51:16.478 --> 51:18.897
Yes, I'd like to ask him
about this hellhole.

51:18.938 --> 51:20.857
I don't want to bring him in.
He's big.

51:20.940 --> 51:22.984
- You know, the floorboards.
- How big?

51:23.068 --> 51:24.027
- How big?
- Yes.

51:24.110 --> 51:27.322
Big. He's like a bear of a guy
with, like, a little head.

51:28.990 --> 51:30.617
I don't know what that means.

51:30.700 --> 51:33.078
Look, I'm going to go help this guy

51:33.119 --> 51:36.748
because Windsong would sure
as hell help this guy. Okay?

51:36.831 --> 51:40.126
I'm going to be back.
Just go back to sleep, okay?

52:10.115 --> 52:12.742
- What's wrong?
- It's for you.

52:13.827 --> 52:15.787
Don't hassle me about crumbs, man,

52:15.870 --> 52:18.706
because I am on
the edge of the edge.

52:20.375 --> 52:21.459
Hello?

52:21.501 --> 52:23.628
Natalie stormed out
of the bedroom.

52:23.711 --> 52:26.756
We had a terrible fight.
You got to come over here now.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.716
I know you got your Army pal
over there.

52:28.800 --> 52:31.386
I didn't know you were in the Army.
If I can come over...

52:31.469 --> 52:33.721
No, l' ll come there.

52:33.805 --> 52:36.474
- Okay, good. Thanks.
- No, no, no. I'll come over.

52:36.516 --> 52:38.977
I'll come there.
Here I come.

52:39.018 --> 52:41.229
I got to go across the street
for a second.

52:41.312 --> 52:43.857
That is incorrect. Follow me.

52:47.318 --> 52:49.779
This was no picnic, let me tell you.

52:49.863 --> 52:52.699
I had an '88 Ford flatbed

52:52.782 --> 52:55.285
all lined up
with a brand-new winch,

52:55.368 --> 52:58.496
but I fried it during the hot-wire,
goddamn it.

52:58.538 --> 53:02.459
Good thing Monk passed out,
or I'd never got this baby.

53:04.210 --> 53:05.837
Whoa.

53:05.879 --> 53:08.923
What in the shit is this?
What is it?

53:09.883 --> 53:14.554
It's winches, hoists, pulleys, blocks
and tackles. This kind of thing.

53:14.637 --> 53:18.266
You know how I got the idea? You know
those big things on Easter lsland?

53:18.349 --> 53:20.351
- Easter lsland?
- Huh?

53:20.435 --> 53:21.519
Easter lsland?

53:21.603 --> 53:25.857
With this device, I can place that horse
on top of any object.

53:25.899 --> 53:28.568
That truck's too high.
You won't get the horse in there.

53:28.651 --> 53:32.072
You're like a specially trained
super agent. You know that?

53:32.155 --> 53:34.866
Why do you think I called you?
I was so pissed off.

53:34.908 --> 53:39.120
I nearly climbed back into your house
and smashed some plates.

53:40.330 --> 53:43.249
Stand warned, okay, stand warned.

53:43.333 --> 53:46.711
I have to go over there for a minute
or you don't get your money.

53:46.795 --> 53:48.296
- Do you want your money?
- Yes.

53:48.379 --> 53:52.383
Then put that horse on top of my van.
There's rope and tarp in the garage.

53:52.467 --> 53:55.595
- Put the horse on the van?
- Put the horse on the van.

53:55.678 --> 53:57.514
- Rope.
- Yeah, and be quiet.

53:57.597 --> 53:59.015
It's simple, okay?

53:59.099 --> 54:01.267
- All right? I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

54:02.977 --> 54:04.229
Hello, Mr. Tim.

54:04.312 --> 54:07.190
You're looking very sprightly
for the hour.

54:07.273 --> 54:10.944
We go up the stairs, please.
Right this way.

54:15.073 --> 54:17.200
I've never been in this part.

54:17.283 --> 54:20.829
They are practicing for the tournament.

54:25.708 --> 54:26.918
Come on!

54:27.001 --> 54:28.420
Yes!

54:28.503 --> 54:30.588
Who's your nanny?!

54:38.847 --> 54:40.348
Hey.

54:40.432 --> 54:42.142
Come.

54:44.602 --> 54:46.229
Come here.

54:47.147 --> 54:49.399
Right here, come on.

54:50.608 --> 54:53.945
You're incredible, do you know that?
You're an incredible friend.

54:55.447 --> 54:58.867
- What the hell was that?
- They're bowling next door.

54:58.950 --> 55:02.287
Getting ready for your tournament.
They're hitting strikes.

55:02.370 --> 55:04.706
- She's been blaming me for Corky.
- Who?

55:04.789 --> 55:09.294
Natalie, she just kept blaming me
for Corky and making me feel guilty.

55:09.377 --> 55:11.463
Then she starts up with the shit thing.

55:11.546 --> 55:13.673
How do I know where the shit goes?!

55:13.757 --> 55:17.260
Then I tell her, "I'm going to Rome
tomorrow," and she freaks out!

55:17.343 --> 55:21.014
She has a complete flip out!
She flips out the room!

55:21.097 --> 55:23.141
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

55:23.183 --> 55:26.186
- Some other wing.

55:26.227 --> 55:29.564
But, buddy...
this ltaly thing is huge.

55:29.647 --> 55:32.484
It could seriously...
It could mean literally billions.

55:32.567 --> 55:36.529
You know what I think this is?
I think you just got to get some sleep.

55:36.613 --> 55:40.450
You got to shut everything down.
Get under the covers. Come on.

55:40.533 --> 55:43.203
Get under the covers.
Don't listen to anything.

55:43.286 --> 55:46.623
- Sometimes you think you hear things...
- You're a great friend.

55:49.375 --> 55:53.129
Sleep and it's going to be different
and don't wake up. Okay?

55:57.133 --> 55:58.802
# Valderi

55:58.885 --> 56:00.386
# Valdera

56:00.470 --> 56:01.971
# Valderi

56:02.055 --> 56:05.183
# Valdera ha ha ha...

56:05.266 --> 56:07.227
# Valderi

56:08.394 --> 56:09.854
Et cetera.

56:09.896 --> 56:11.523
What about here? Right here?

56:11.606 --> 56:13.858
You kidding? There's towns around.

56:13.942 --> 56:16.194
You want somebody else
finding my horse?

56:17.278 --> 56:19.114
There'll be towns everywhere.

56:19.197 --> 56:22.033
Hey, six months I drove
a yogurt truck, okay?

56:22.075 --> 56:23.868
This is my territory, Jack.

56:39.426 --> 56:41.553
What do you got up there?

56:42.512 --> 56:44.097
A sofa.

56:44.180 --> 56:46.766
What kind of sofa?

56:46.850 --> 56:48.435
Homemade.

56:56.192 --> 56:59.946
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- Troopers.

57:00.029 --> 57:02.574
Oh, no.

57:07.078 --> 57:08.538
The bridge is out.

57:08.621 --> 57:11.666
Follow the detour along the river
to the next bridge, all right?

57:11.750 --> 57:12.917
Thank you very much.

57:13.001 --> 57:14.961
- Have a good night.
- Let's go.

57:15.044 --> 57:17.547
He didn't notice the horse.

57:17.630 --> 57:22.135
Smokey didn't even notice
that we got a horse on the roof.

57:28.475 --> 57:32.103
- I can't believe he didn't see it.
- Dumb Smokey.

57:43.990 --> 57:47.035
- How about right here?
- No, it's not good.

57:47.118 --> 57:49.537
- What's wrong with here?
- It doesn't feel right.

57:49.621 --> 57:51.581
I hope it's very soon.

57:51.664 --> 57:55.126
I got to be back there.
It's going to be light out.

57:55.210 --> 57:58.963
They're asleep and don't know you left.
I'm doing you a favor doing this.

57:59.005 --> 58:01.091
How about here?
What's wrong with here?

58:01.174 --> 58:03.885
I dig up the horse, I haul it up,
I invent everything.

58:03.968 --> 58:06.429
Why do we have to do
what you want to do?

58:06.513 --> 58:09.015
- Corky's new home.
- This is not good for me.

58:09.057 --> 58:10.975
Forget it. This is it, right here.
Okay?

58:11.059 --> 58:12.185
Bad vibe.

58:15.855 --> 58:18.316
Oh, no! He's gone!

58:20.652 --> 58:22.153
Where'd he go?!

58:22.237 --> 58:25.198
Did you hear anything?
Like a thump?

58:26.282 --> 58:28.493
Where did he go?

58:28.535 --> 58:30.662
Shit!

58:30.703 --> 58:34.165
- Did you check the knots?
- Knots? Who knows knots?

58:34.207 --> 58:37.168
- Not you.
- You know, I'm not Popeye.

58:37.210 --> 58:40.505
How did we not hear? How do you
not hear a horse fall off a car?

58:40.588 --> 58:43.091
Maybe he's not dead.
Maybe he ran away.

58:43.174 --> 58:47.262
It's raining so hard,
the horse might have fallen off

58:47.345 --> 58:50.223
and floated, who knows, into a ditch.

58:51.224 --> 58:54.686
There's a river that runs
along this road. He could be in it.

58:54.769 --> 58:57.355
Corky could be heading
for the open sea.

59:15.832 --> 59:19.502
My God, honey.
What time is it?

59:19.586 --> 59:21.713
It's okay.
Go back to sleep.

59:21.755 --> 59:23.465
Yeah?

59:23.548 --> 59:25.467
Did you solve the problem?

59:26.593 --> 59:28.595
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:28.636 --> 59:30.346
Actually...

59:32.474 --> 59:34.350
I think I did.

59:35.351 --> 59:40.356
# Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

59:40.440 --> 59:42.484
Whoo!

59:42.567 --> 59:47.113
# Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

59:48.698 --> 59:51.951
-
- Timmy! Telephone!

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.128
Good morning, Mr. Tim.

01:00:02.212 --> 01:00:03.463
I must say...

01:00:03.546 --> 01:00:06.758
you're looking fit as a fiddle
this morning, Mr. Tim.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.260
Thanks.
I hear Mr. Nick wants to see me.

01:00:09.302 --> 01:00:10.845
Yes, I know.

01:00:10.929 --> 01:00:14.015
He's running in the woods.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.227
I talked to the guys over at 3M.
I know you got canned.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.938
You've met Pete, right?
My trainer.

01:00:20.021 --> 01:00:22.982
Don't feel funny around Pete.
I got no secrets from Pete.

01:00:23.024 --> 01:00:24.943
- Do l, Pete?
- I don't think so.

01:00:24.984 --> 01:00:27.487
So here's the deal:
Buddy boy...

01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:31.282
that my little hearty
hi-ho Silver routine

01:00:31.324 --> 01:00:35.286
affected you like that,
all I can say is, I am such a jerk.

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:37.497
But it's the best thing
that ever happened,

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.542
because now I'll go kick ass in Rome.
And guess what?

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:44.295
You, you unemployed bum,
you'll come kick ass with me.

01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:46.172
I want us to be partners.

01:00:46.256 --> 01:00:48.716
I want us to be equal again, man.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.886
Why not? I mean, for crying out loud,
I've got a Pete.

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:55.807
Why shouldn't you have a Pete?
Who wouldn't like having a Pete?

01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:59.060
So this is the deal.
From now on, you and me, 50/50.

01:00:59.144 --> 01:01:02.897
- 50/50?
- That's right. 50/50.

01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:06.651
I'll talk to my lawyer. Why didn't
I think of it sooner? It's awesome!

01:01:06.735 --> 01:01:10.488
Get the hell out of here,
the limo leaves in an hour and a half!

01:01:10.572 --> 01:01:13.366
Buddy boy! Let's go, buddy boy!

01:01:14.367 --> 01:01:18.121
All right. Come on. Now, pump it up.
I want full cardio blast now.

01:01:18.204 --> 01:01:20.373
- Let's go.
- Don't be shy.

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.168
There you go.

01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:26.421
No, keep going! Keep it there!

01:01:29.215 --> 01:01:30.467
Crampers.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:32.552
- You all right?
- Crampers.

01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:34.804
I don't know, honey.
Do you want to do this?

01:01:34.888 --> 01:01:37.265
I mean, do we want to be part
of the shit industry?

01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:40.185
What about the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

01:01:40.226 --> 01:01:44.147
I don't think this conflicts with that.
I mean, you know, there's...

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:48.777
It's a lot of money and the heart
of the heart, and they're both...

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:53.031
Still have the heart
with a lot of money.

01:01:53.114 --> 01:01:56.034
- I think. You know.
- You know what I think?

01:01:56.076 --> 01:01:59.913
I think I know what we should do.
We should just try it.

01:01:59.996 --> 01:02:01.623
- Try it!
- Yes.

01:02:01.706 --> 01:02:02.665
- Try it.
- Try it.

01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:04.375
Try it.

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:06.961
- Try it. See how it feels.
- Try it.

01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:11.424
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.222
- Bye, Daddy.
- We'll miss you.

01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:19.307
- We miss you already.
- I'll be home soon.

01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:34.948
Good to see you, captain.

01:02:43.623 --> 01:02:46.292
You know what I was thinking?
We should target zoos.

01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:47.710
Thank you, Denise. Zoos?

01:02:47.752 --> 01:02:50.672
Yeah, zoos. I mean, come on,
they're full of poop.

01:02:50.755 --> 01:02:53.758
I popped on the lnternet
just before we got on the plane.

01:02:53.842 --> 01:02:57.512
Did you know that an elephant goes,
like 1 00 pounds a day?

01:02:57.595 --> 01:03:01.683
Times that by seven, that's 700 pounds
of dung a week for one elephant.

01:03:01.766 --> 01:03:04.644
There's got to be thousands of zoos
in the world.

01:03:04.727 --> 01:03:08.731
That is really very good. Zoos.

01:03:08.815 --> 01:03:10.817
- I got another one for you.
- Yeah?

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.778
Travel industry.
We get into the travel industry.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.990
I'm talking about little
travel-size Vapoorize.

01:03:17.073 --> 01:03:20.326
You mean,
like the cute little shampoo bottles?

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.538
- Exactly.
- My God, that's so simple and awesome!

01:03:23.621 --> 01:03:25.957
You're on a trip.
You're walking through Venice.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.710
You step in some dog doo.
So, what do you do?

01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:31.504
- You take out a travel-size Vapoorize.
- That's it!

01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:34.174
A little Velcro holster
you put on your belt.

01:03:34.257 --> 01:03:37.343
Right next to your cell phone,
your pager, your Vapoorize.

01:03:37.427 --> 01:03:40.638
You can walk the dog handsfree
and not worry about the Vapoorize.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.765
I love a holster.

01:03:41.848 --> 01:03:44.142
- Accessorize with Vapoorize.
- Hold on.

01:03:44.225 --> 01:03:46.519
Hold on. Let me take it from here.

01:03:46.603 --> 01:03:48.897
# You're walkin' along

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.356
# A-doodley doo

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.651
# All of a sudden
You stepped in poo!

01:03:53.735 --> 01:03:55.987
# You don't know what to do

01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:58.990
- What do you do?
- I don't know what to do.

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:03.536
# Vapoorize, Vapoorize

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.457
- # Mountain-scented Vapoorize
- # doogah-doogah-doogah Vapoorize

01:04:07.499 --> 01:04:09.542
- What is the doogah?
- I thought there would be drums.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:11.252
- What is the doogah?
- I thought there would be drums.

01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:32.857
Come on. Look at this place.

01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:34.859
Go check out your bedroom.

01:04:39.406 --> 01:04:41.074
Whoo!

01:04:47.163 --> 01:04:48.331
Wow.

01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:11.938
Vapoorize.

01:05:35.628 --> 01:05:37.088
Shopping.

01:05:37.172 --> 01:05:39.382
Gucci.

01:05:40.133 --> 01:05:41.676
Here.

01:05:42.385 --> 01:05:45.138
This'll look great in the yard
next to the bug tent.

01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:49.350
Definitely. We'll take it.
It's great. Pay the man.

01:05:49.434 --> 01:05:53.104
It makes the whole house.
It makes the yard. With the sound.

01:05:53.188 --> 01:05:56.316
With the sound. It's ridiculous,
but that's what I love about it.

01:05:56.399 --> 01:05:57.442
I like this.

01:05:57.525 --> 01:06:00.695
...with the Dow off 1 1 and
the NASDAQ up five and a half.

01:06:00.779 --> 01:06:03.448
A rather sluggish day on Wall Street.

01:06:03.531 --> 01:06:07.202
On the international front, investors
are watching Vanderpark Enterprises.

01:06:07.285 --> 01:06:10.955
CEO, Nicholas Vanderpark and newly
appointed partner, Tim Dingman...

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:13.875
arrive in Italy to introduce to Europe

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:19.297
their complete line of fecal-removing
product that's been so successful here.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.050
The American entrepreneurs
have reason to be hopeful.

01:06:22.133 --> 01:06:25.720
They were greeted with great enthusiasm
everywhere and fanfare.

01:06:25.804 --> 01:06:29.891
Later, they'll be feted at a banquet
to be held in the presidential palace.

01:06:38.399 --> 01:06:41.778
He says, "l noticed
when we climbed into the tub

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:45.782
"our three penises were quite similar
in size and bulk."

01:06:49.911 --> 01:06:53.164
He say, "And I thought to myself,

01:06:53.206 --> 01:06:55.542
"'Good. Good."'

01:06:57.001 --> 01:06:59.212
Envy is a funny, funny thing.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:07.262
He says, "l remember when
I was a teenager,

01:07:07.345 --> 01:07:10.682
"my friend Armando and I spent
the summer in New York.

01:07:10.723 --> 01:07:12.684
"A sweet time of life."

01:07:21.985 --> 01:07:23.862
The minister, he says,

01:07:23.945 --> 01:07:28.241
"l must tell you, my friend Armando
had a hog like a freight train."

01:07:28.324 --> 01:07:30.827
What a hog.

01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:40.378
He says,
"And I must tell you secretly,

01:07:40.462 --> 01:07:43.339
"Armando's freight-train-sized manhood

01:07:43.381 --> 01:07:47.343
"made me, with a regular-size one,
quite miserable."

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:53.558
"Not all the time miserable,
of course, but sometimes."

01:08:03.902 --> 01:08:07.280
This call has been
transferred to you.

01:08:07.363 --> 01:08:09.491
Thank you.

01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:12.202
Hello?

01:08:12.285 --> 01:08:14.412
Turbo Everyman, my ass.

01:08:14.496 --> 01:08:18.124
Where do you get off at?
I bought you drinks.

01:08:18.207 --> 01:08:21.419
You vacation in my bungalow
and now you go jump ship.

01:08:21.461 --> 01:08:23.796
Screw Robin Hood, you hear me?

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.091
Screw the Merry Men.
You're a stinko pinko.

01:08:27.175 --> 01:08:28.926
Turncoat!

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:31.095
Here's what I do, Mr. Traitor.

01:08:31.179 --> 01:08:35.100
Remember Lester? He pumped our gas
when we moved the sofa.

01:08:35.183 --> 01:08:37.602
Not a tooth in his head, nice fella.

01:08:37.644 --> 01:08:41.648
- Remember him now?
- I do. Yes.

01:08:41.731 --> 01:08:47.112
Good. For $50,000
Lester keeps thinking it's a sofa.

01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:49.531
And me and him don't spill the beans

01:08:49.613 --> 01:08:52.450
to your hoity-toity pal
across the street.

01:08:52.492 --> 01:08:56.787
Let's be very clear on this:
I want $50,000...

01:08:56.871 --> 01:09:00.041
or I tell your friend
you killed his horse.

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:21.688
Debbie? Deb, I'm home.

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:25.483
Sweetheart, I've been liposucked.

01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:28.987
Can you tell? Can you?
Does it look good?

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:33.491
Dr. Weitzman is supposed to be a genius
and it didn't even really hurt.

01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:37.495
And that is not all.
Come. I am so excited.

01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:40.749
Here's a little gift I bought for us.

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:43.667
A little 50/50 surprise.

01:09:45.336 --> 01:09:47.546
- My big international partner.
- Debbie.

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.049
- Let's do it on the laundry.
- Where are the kids?!

01:09:50.133 --> 01:09:52.301
At Mother's, honey. It's just us.

01:09:52.385 --> 01:09:56.890
Come lie on the warm pile.
It's all clean out of the dryer.

01:09:56.973 --> 01:09:59.934
I will lie with you
after I tell you something important.

01:10:00.018 --> 01:10:04.856
I got drunk and by mistake killed Corky.
I buried him in the swimming pool hole.

01:10:04.898 --> 01:10:07.984
The pool guy,
he's actually some bum I met at a bar.

01:10:08.068 --> 01:10:09.694
Nick? Where does it go?

01:10:09.778 --> 01:10:11.654
- What?
- The shit.

01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:13.364
- Where does the shit go?
- Up.

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:16.117
Up is not good enough.
You'll have to do better than up.

01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:19.287
- Up... and out.
- Out where?!

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.206
Up and out. Out. Up and out.

01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:23.374
- Up and out?
- Up and out.

01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:25.752
The bum wants $50,000
or he'll tell Nick.

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:28.797
- Then we won't get a chance to be rich.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.132
Oh, my God.

01:10:31.216 --> 01:10:32.717
Yes!

01:10:32.801 --> 01:10:34.385
Go and pay the bum.

01:10:34.469 --> 01:10:36.596
- Go pay the bum now.
- Go pay the bum?!

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.724
- Honey, I love you.
- I love you too.

01:10:39.808 --> 01:10:41.434
- Bye.
- Oh!

01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:42.602
What?

01:10:42.685 --> 01:10:45.688
You don't know this guy.
He's not like other people, he's...

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:47.982
What if we pay him
and then he wants more?

01:10:48.066 --> 01:10:50.902
Then we will give him more.

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.487
What if he wants more again?!

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:55.949
We'll give him more money because
we'll have enough money to give him.

01:10:56.032 --> 01:10:59.160
But it'll never end with him.
He'll be in our lives forever.

01:10:59.244 --> 01:11:02.497
Tim, if he tells Nick,
it'll all be over.

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.624
You know, what else can we do?

01:11:06.668 --> 01:11:08.670
We fess up.

01:11:10.004 --> 01:11:12.674
- Fess up?
- Yeah.

01:11:12.757 --> 01:11:15.802
Yeah. No, no, no. We fess up.
We fess up. We tell Nick.

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:18.012
We go and ask for forgiveness.

01:11:18.096 --> 01:11:19.556
- Forgiveness?
- Yes.

01:11:19.597 --> 01:11:23.059
- Honey, you killed his horse!
- I'm telling him everything.

01:11:23.143 --> 01:11:26.646
No, sweetheart! Please.
Please don't do it to me.

01:11:26.729 --> 01:11:30.775
I love my car in the garage.
It's got heated seats.

01:11:30.859 --> 01:11:33.528
And I've got shoes. I've got bags.

01:11:33.611 --> 01:11:35.739
- Knock, knock.
- Clothes.

01:11:35.822 --> 01:11:38.408
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:40.160
Look at you two.

01:11:40.243 --> 01:11:44.456
God, I'm so envious of you!
You've got to give Natalie a talk.

01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:47.751
She's locked herself in the bathroom
and I want what you have so bad!

01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:50.420
- I want some of that!
- Okay.

01:11:50.503 --> 01:11:55.216
Shh! Don't say a word.
Not a word. Not a word. Okay?

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.428
Everywhere I go,
they yell, "Where does the shit go?"

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:00.764
And we don't know!
What if my opponent's right?

01:12:00.805 --> 01:12:03.141
- What if we are polluting?
- Natalie...

01:12:03.224 --> 01:12:07.979
the only thing this guy Shaunessey's
got going for him is your own guilt.

01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:09.564
Guilt that you're wealthy.

01:12:09.647 --> 01:12:14.486
You know what, we're partners now
and we have money too.

01:12:14.527 --> 01:12:16.613
You know what we'll do with ours?

01:12:16.654 --> 01:12:21.785
We're going to sponsor the biggest rally
for you that this town has ever seen.

01:12:21.868 --> 01:12:24.579
Then we'll throw out
this challenge:

01:12:24.662 --> 01:12:30.794
We'll say that if anyone can say
that Vapoorize does damage to anything,

01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:33.922
then Natalie Vanderpark will cease
to be a candidate.

01:12:40.011 --> 01:12:43.890
May I suggest
we put on our dancing shoes?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.395
Honey! I love you.

01:12:49.479 --> 01:12:51.981
So how was the flight?
Was it enjoyable?

01:12:52.065 --> 01:12:54.984
Yeah, it was fine. It was very smooth.
Everything went fine.

01:12:55.026 --> 01:12:57.862
Here's what I got to tell you.
We'll pay you the money, okay?

01:12:57.946 --> 01:12:59.614
We got it all worked out.

01:12:59.697 --> 01:13:02.492
That is sensational news,
my little gypsy roving friend.

01:13:02.534 --> 01:13:06.579
But I've revised my thinking
about the $50,000 grand thing.

01:13:06.663 --> 01:13:11.167
I can't accept that.
I mean, what are we, animals?

01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:13.628
- What? No, we're not animals.
- No, of course not.

01:13:13.711 --> 01:13:17.215
What we are is pals.
You slept in my bunk.

01:13:17.298 --> 01:13:20.301
I ate some of your crackers.
We sang in the rain.

01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:21.678
# Valderi

01:13:21.719 --> 01:13:23.179
# Valdera

01:13:24.597 --> 01:13:26.349
# Valderi

01:13:27.016 --> 01:13:28.643
# Valdera ha ha ha...

01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:30.311
Okay.

01:13:32.063 --> 01:13:34.524
# My knapsack on my back

01:13:34.566 --> 01:13:36.985
- Yes, I remember.
- That's when we were buddies.

01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:39.195
Last week? Yeah. I remember.

01:13:39.279 --> 01:13:43.867
So, what I'm saying is to hell
with the flat cash payout.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.785
I say let's be partners.

01:13:45.869 --> 01:13:47.746
- Partners?
- Why not?

01:13:47.787 --> 01:13:49.956
- What do you mean "partners"?
- You, me...

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:52.959
your other so-called friend
in a cozy little triumvirate.

01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:54.461
Am I using the word correctly?

01:13:54.544 --> 01:13:58.089
Listen to me. We're not partners, okay?
How can we be partners?

01:13:58.173 --> 01:14:00.633
We'll iron out the details
when I come over later.

01:14:00.717 --> 01:14:03.261
- No.
- This evening. Who knows exactly when.

01:14:03.344 --> 01:14:05.013
- You're not coming over here.
- Yes.

01:14:05.096 --> 01:14:08.641
And don't you worry, buddy partner.
I'll smooth out the rough parts.

01:14:08.725 --> 01:14:12.228
- You want to talk? Where are you?
- I'm coming over.

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:14.939
- You're not coming over.
- Don't you worry, buddy roll.

01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:16.858
We'll put pen to paper. Bye-bye.

01:14:16.941 --> 01:14:18.318
- Listen to me.
- Bye-bye.

01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:21.279
There are no rough parts to smooth...
What? Hello?

01:14:25.366 --> 01:14:26.826
Oh, God.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:30.622
All right. I got to tell Nick.
I'm just going to tell him.

01:14:47.847 --> 01:14:51.601
Come on, honey.
Start with your hips.

01:14:52.393 --> 01:14:53.978
Come on.

01:14:54.062 --> 01:14:55.605
Whoo!

01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:13.540
Mr. Vanderpark!
Mr. Vanderpark!

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.335
Mr. Vanderpark!
Mr. Vanderpark!

01:15:17.377 --> 01:15:20.255
- The merry-go-round is acting up again.

01:15:22.465 --> 01:15:25.427
I hate that thing. I hate it.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.346
Timmy, I'm sorry,
we got to deal with it.

01:15:32.851 --> 01:15:35.854
Nick, I gotta talk to you.
I did something really stupid.

01:15:35.937 --> 01:15:39.399
You won't believe what happened.
The stupidest, most ridiculous thing.

01:15:39.482 --> 01:15:41.151
That wife of yours was incredible.

01:15:41.234 --> 01:15:44.863
But I don't care how much money
we make, don't buy one of these.

01:15:44.946 --> 01:15:48.116
It's junk.
It just keeps speeding up for no reason.

01:15:48.199 --> 01:15:52.787
- Nick, I got to talk to you.
- And the on/off button's in the middle!

01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:55.957
- I did a horrible thing.
- The thing's in the middle.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.043
- Here goes. All right, come on.
- Nick!

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.927
- Nick!

01:16:24.569 --> 01:16:28.031
- Hang on!
- I can't hold on much longer!

01:16:36.164 --> 01:16:38.166
- Nick, are you okay?
- Ribs.

01:16:38.249 --> 01:16:40.293
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:16:40.376 --> 01:16:41.753
Goddamned...

01:16:41.795 --> 01:16:45.590
Bastard, bitch merry-go-round.
Stupid merry-go-round!

01:16:45.673 --> 01:16:49.094
- I got to talk to you.
- Stupid, crappy, stupid thing.

01:16:49.177 --> 01:16:51.846
I've been feeling guilty
for a long time.

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:55.433
- It's impossible to turn it off.
- I did something really stupid.

01:16:55.517 --> 01:16:58.019
- I hate you, merry-go-round.
- Where's the switch?

01:16:58.103 --> 01:17:01.940
It's in the middle of the thing.
It's impossible to turn off.

01:17:02.023 --> 01:17:03.817
- Where's the button?
- In the middle.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.319
I'll turn it off, then we'll talk.

01:17:06.403 --> 01:17:07.529
I'll get it.

01:17:14.327 --> 01:17:16.413
- Whoa!
- Ow!

01:17:16.496 --> 01:17:19.791
Oh! Oh! Timmy.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:23.711
Man, are you all right?
Let me help you up there.

01:17:23.795 --> 01:17:28.133
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy. All right.

01:17:28.174 --> 01:17:29.717
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.801 --> 01:17:34.431
It knocked the wind out of you.
You went flying off of that thing.

01:17:34.514 --> 01:17:39.519
Now, listen. I don't want to let this
ruin our jolly feeling.

01:17:39.602 --> 01:17:42.981
Let's go back in there
and talk about this fantastic rally.

01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:46.234
- No, Nick. You see this bow and arrow?
- Yeah.

01:17:46.317 --> 01:17:48.778
- One night...
- Yeah?

01:17:49.821 --> 01:17:51.698
One night...

01:17:51.781 --> 01:17:54.325
I'm so ashamed of this.
But one night...

01:17:57.662 --> 01:18:00.790
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, man!

01:18:00.832 --> 01:18:03.710
- I told you it was a piece of junk!
- I'm glad we weren't on it.

01:18:03.793 --> 01:18:05.670
- What?
- I'm glad we weren't on it.

01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:09.716
- I can't hear. Are your ears ringing?
- No.

01:18:09.799 --> 01:18:13.470
Boy, mine are. What was it
you were saying, my fine friend?

01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:16.639
What I was saying is that one night
I got drunk. All right?

01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:19.684
Being drunk had nothing to do with it.
I can't even explain it.

01:18:19.768 --> 01:18:23.563
Wait, you know what?
I'm thinking it's just one ear.

01:18:23.646 --> 01:18:27.400
I hear you way better
when I turn like this. Talk to me.

01:18:27.484 --> 01:18:30.779
That night I got drunk and
I was aiming this arrow at my house.

01:18:30.862 --> 01:18:33.031
No, it's both ears.
What are you doing?

01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:34.699
I'm trying to tell you.

01:18:34.783 --> 01:18:37.327
I pulled it back, I aimed at the house,
I did this.

01:18:37.368 --> 01:18:40.663
Nick, Nathan and Nellie
want you to kiss their boo-boos.

01:18:40.705 --> 01:18:43.708
Wait, I heard that. I'm coming!

01:18:43.792 --> 01:18:45.585
That was not a smart thing to do.

01:18:45.668 --> 01:18:46.836
- I know!
- Come on.

01:18:46.878 --> 01:18:49.714
No, Nick!
I got to tell...

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.355
Oh, shit!

01:19:07.982 --> 01:19:10.318
- Timmy, honey!
- What?!

01:19:10.402 --> 01:19:11.528
Where are you?

01:19:11.611 --> 01:19:15.782
Timmy. Honey, I got it.
Definitely in the hips.

01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:17.784
Timmy, where have you been?

01:19:17.867 --> 01:19:19.577
- I killed the bum.
- What?

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:20.870
The bum. I shot an arrow.

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:24.040
It went up, it went down.
It's in the bum. I killed him.

01:19:24.082 --> 01:19:25.625
Come. Come.

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:28.211
- Did you work out a deal with him?
- No! He's dead.

01:19:28.253 --> 01:19:31.214
It's in his back. The arrow.
I shot him. I killed him.

01:19:31.256 --> 01:19:33.383
I killed a person!

01:19:35.218 --> 01:19:38.888
What? Is this a joke?
I don't get your jokes sometimes.

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:42.016
And I'll tell you something:
I don't think it's always me.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.476
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Honey!

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.938
- Hurry. Get in the house.
- Let it go. Stop! What are you doing?

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.773
Wait! He could be in the house.

01:19:48.815 --> 01:19:52.610
- There's nobody there! God.
- Car! He's wounded! He's crazy!

01:19:52.694 --> 01:19:56.364
- Honey, this is really insane.
- Get in! Get in!

01:20:13.256 --> 01:20:14.883
Excuse me.

01:20:14.966 --> 01:20:18.094
This'll take half a second.
Could you tell me...

01:20:18.178 --> 01:20:20.472
what's sticking in my back, please?

01:20:22.307 --> 01:20:24.350
- Arrow.
- Fricking nitwit.

01:20:24.434 --> 01:20:29.439
Look, I'm being stalked
by a genuine madman, okay?

01:20:29.481 --> 01:20:31.733
I'm talking about a black force here.

01:20:31.816 --> 01:20:34.444
I hate spoiling the atmosphere,

01:20:34.527 --> 01:20:38.865
but would you mind
tugging the arrow out?

01:20:39.449 --> 01:20:43.870
I want you to stop the car.
Honey, stop the car right now!

01:20:43.953 --> 01:20:47.707
- Look. The guy's crazy.
- There is no dead man!

01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:49.584
He's a loose cannon.

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:52.462
- Excuse me.

01:20:55.465 --> 01:20:58.259
Oh, my God, there is a bum
with an arrow.

01:20:58.343 --> 01:21:00.386
He looks afraid of us.

01:21:06.142 --> 01:21:09.187
You ever hear of "reach for the sky"?

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:12.315
You just shoot a guy in the back
with no warning.

01:21:12.398 --> 01:21:14.025
That's right.

01:21:14.109 --> 01:21:16.528
That's correct.
That's right. That's what I do.

01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:18.613
Well, then, good God almighty,

01:21:18.696 --> 01:21:22.033
we have entered, indeed,
into a dark day.

01:21:23.076 --> 01:21:26.162
You got to talk to him.
We were pals.

01:21:26.246 --> 01:21:28.832
Who shoots a pal in the back
with a bow and arrow?

01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:31.668
- Over a couple of bucks.
- Me.

01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:34.963
I'm an archer and I shoot arrows.

01:21:35.046 --> 01:21:38.508
And I got more back
where they came from. My quiver.

01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:40.927
Listen to me.
I just wanted what you wanted.

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.179
A little taste of the good life.

01:21:43.221 --> 01:21:46.307
A little taste of honey.
Is that so bad? Is it?

01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:49.102
But you win.

01:21:49.185 --> 01:21:53.690
Man, I fold. I can see it:
Greed has hardened your heart.

01:21:53.773 --> 01:21:56.401
And money's poisoned your soul.

01:21:56.484 --> 01:21:58.194
I'm out of here.

01:21:58.278 --> 01:22:01.239
There's nothing as dangerous
as large quantities of money.

01:22:01.281 --> 01:22:05.368
That's why I've always remained an
independent contractor, an odd job man.

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.078
I want no part of this.

01:22:08.163 --> 01:22:12.417
I stand before you, begging:
Take the arrow out of my back.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.461
You will never see me again.

01:22:14.544 --> 01:22:18.965
Help me, God! Come on.

01:22:19.048 --> 01:22:21.509
- Honey...

01:22:21.593 --> 01:22:24.596
take the arrow out of his back.

01:22:36.191 --> 01:22:38.026
Thank you.

01:22:39.444 --> 01:22:43.031
- Thank you.
- Souvenir.

01:23:39.546 --> 01:23:41.297
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:23:42.674 --> 01:23:44.843
I couldn't sleep.
I got to talk to you.

01:23:44.926 --> 01:23:46.469
Yeah, I got to talk to you too.

01:23:46.553 --> 01:23:49.848
You know, this big rally tomorrow,
I'm a wreck about it.

01:23:49.889 --> 01:23:53.268
I got to give a big speech.
I'm not a speech guy.

01:23:53.351 --> 01:23:56.479
Are you kidding?
Come on, those infomercials you did.

01:23:56.521 --> 01:23:58.106
You're great in front of people.

01:23:58.189 --> 01:24:01.151
Really? You thought I was good?
You never said a word about it.

01:24:02.193 --> 01:24:05.822
Because it was just another thing
of yours that made me miserable.

01:24:05.905 --> 01:24:07.157
What?

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.701
This is what I have to talk
to you about. Sit down.

01:24:13.913 --> 01:24:15.707
I killed Corky.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.668
You...

01:24:22.005 --> 01:24:23.256
When?

01:24:23.339 --> 01:24:26.676
Now, please, just don't say anything
till I'm done, all right?

01:24:26.718 --> 01:24:29.095
The day that you gave me the wine,
remember?

01:24:29.179 --> 01:24:31.514
I got drunk on the wine.

01:24:31.556 --> 01:24:35.935
I actually was drunk from before.
I went into your yard and...

01:24:48.114 --> 01:24:50.700
So that's it.
There you have it.

01:24:52.285 --> 01:24:55.538
Well, you know, it sounds like
it was an accident.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.124
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I should've told you.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:01.127
That's the thing.
But I don't know what happened.

01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:04.756
I felt guilty or something.

01:25:04.839 --> 01:25:08.885
And I was just so wrapped up in the envy
that I felt for everything you had.

01:25:08.968 --> 01:25:10.428
It's true what they say.

01:25:10.512 --> 01:25:14.933
It's like a little green monster that
comes out and it just poisoned my head.

01:25:14.974 --> 01:25:17.560
And, by the way, you did nothing wrong.

01:25:17.644 --> 01:25:20.438
You followed your dream.
You did what you wanted to do.

01:25:20.522 --> 01:25:23.566
I was always saying, "Don't do it."
You did it and it worked.

01:25:23.608 --> 01:25:27.237
Look, you built a house, right?
That's all you did. You built a house.

01:25:27.278 --> 01:25:30.824
I mean, it's a big house.
I mean, it's a really big house.

01:25:30.907 --> 01:25:34.994
It's a large house.
It's a... I mean, it's...

01:25:35.078 --> 01:25:38.873
It's gigantic, Nick.
It's the White House.

01:25:38.957 --> 01:25:41.960
You built the White House here,
and we're in the shadow of it.

01:25:42.043 --> 01:25:44.546
Literally, every day at 4:00,
we're in its shadow.

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:47.257
That's not your fault.
You wanted to be friends still,

01:25:47.298 --> 01:25:49.217
you didn't want to move
and I love that.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.719
It was coming from such a good place,
but it was...

01:25:51.803 --> 01:25:54.639
It really got to me because every day
I'd have to look at you,

01:25:54.722 --> 01:25:56.558
and see you with all of this stuff.

01:25:56.641 --> 01:26:00.770
You know, buy the yellow Lamborghini
that goes 500 miles an hour.

01:26:00.854 --> 01:26:03.815
Have a bowling alley next to your room.
If I could do it, I would.

01:26:03.857 --> 01:26:06.651
Everybody should have a merry-go-round.
Of course you should.

01:26:06.735 --> 01:26:09.696
Jealousy, every day.
And it was just chewing me up.

01:26:09.779 --> 01:26:13.074
Your kid's playing the concert piano,
my kid's banging trash cans.

01:26:13.158 --> 01:26:14.868
And that has nothing to do with money.

01:26:14.951 --> 01:26:18.037
That's just his musical ability.
That's a whole other thing.

01:26:18.121 --> 01:26:21.458
You just gave to us. You gave
and you gave and you're so generous.

01:26:21.499 --> 01:26:23.042
And what am I going to give you?

01:26:23.126 --> 01:26:26.838
I gave you tube socks for Christmas
last year. That's not going to work.

01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:28.965
- I like the socks.
- You gave us so much.

01:26:29.007 --> 01:26:32.927
The coffee machine. It's a beautiful,
giant rocketship-sized coffee machine.

01:26:33.011 --> 01:26:36.514
Debbie loved the coffee. I'll tell you
something, I never tasted it.

01:26:36.598 --> 01:26:38.641
I wanted to tell you that.

01:26:38.725 --> 01:26:41.227
I can't even tell you
I haven't tried the coffee.

01:26:41.311 --> 01:26:43.730
Like I'll feel better
if I don't drink your coffee.

01:26:43.813 --> 01:26:46.691
And you gave our kids flan.
All of a sudden my son's going,

01:26:46.775 --> 01:26:48.485
"Daddy, where's the flan?"

01:26:48.568 --> 01:26:51.696
It felt like a dagger in my heart
every time he'd request flan.

01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.281
It made me feel little.

01:26:53.364 --> 01:26:56.242
I felt like a little man
who didn't like flan.

01:26:56.326 --> 01:26:59.370
The horse was great, Nick.
Of course you should have a horse.

01:26:59.454 --> 01:27:02.874
Does it have to be a white horse
that you come galloping up on,

01:27:02.916 --> 01:27:04.793
and it neighs
and makes the whole thing?

01:27:04.876 --> 01:27:09.214
Of course. Make it a beautiful horse
that I think, honestly, didn't like me.

01:27:09.297 --> 01:27:12.092
It had nothing to do with anything,
I never clicked with it.

01:27:12.175 --> 01:27:15.762
I think the horse sensed something.
I think "horse sense" is a real thing.

01:27:15.845 --> 01:27:20.016
Because the horse had a feeling.
He came over and sensed the envy I felt.

01:27:20.058 --> 01:27:23.937
He'd come over and eat the apples.
He'd see me and give me a weird look.

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.441
I'm telling you. You know how sometimes
the side of a face and you get one eye?

01:27:28.525 --> 01:27:31.486
He would keep the eye on me
and I knew he was thinking something.

01:27:31.569 --> 01:27:35.031
That's unrelated to what happened
with the arrow. That was an accident.

01:27:35.073 --> 01:27:38.034
I swear to God. I swear to God.
I couldn't do it if I tried.

01:27:38.076 --> 01:27:42.956
I'm sorry about this.
I feel horrible. I feel bad.

01:27:43.039 --> 01:27:46.709
I feel like I have this fountain
in my yard that I don't deserve.

01:27:46.793 --> 01:27:48.920
I don't deserve to be your partner.

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:53.216
I don't deserve to be your friend.
I just...

01:27:53.258 --> 01:27:56.010
Well, you know what, Tim?
You made a mistake.

01:27:56.094 --> 01:27:58.721
You're human.
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:27:59.264 --> 01:28:01.933
So what, man?
You're still my best friend.

01:28:02.016 --> 01:28:04.394
- Really?
- Of course.

01:28:06.062 --> 01:28:08.940
Of course. Come on, man.

01:28:09.023 --> 01:28:10.984
It was a big mistake.

01:28:11.067 --> 01:28:14.571
It was a big mistake.
It was a doozy.

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.282
Corky.

01:28:17.365 --> 01:28:20.076
- I'm sorry, Nick.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:22.412
I know how much
you loved him and l...

01:28:22.454 --> 01:28:25.540
I did love Corky.

01:28:25.623 --> 01:28:27.459
I never liked Corky.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.837
I mean, he's beautiful on the outside.
It's just something wasn't...

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.172
We're still partners.

01:28:32.255 --> 01:28:35.425
There is no way you are getting out
of this partnership.

01:28:35.467 --> 01:28:37.177
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.429
And I will see you tomorrow
at the big rally.

01:28:40.972 --> 01:28:42.515
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.477
Big day.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.395
Big day.

01:28:47.479 --> 01:28:49.981
Poor Corky.
One little target arrow.

01:28:50.064 --> 01:28:52.609
You wouldn't think that could kill
a great big horse.

01:28:52.692 --> 01:28:54.444
That's exactly what I thought.

01:28:54.486 --> 01:28:57.113
It's one little arrow
and when I shot the bum...

01:28:57.155 --> 01:28:59.491
he hardly seemed to notice.

01:29:01.159 --> 01:29:04.120
You know, that fountain
looked a lot better in Rome.

01:29:06.831 --> 01:29:08.625
- Yeah.
- Well...

01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:12.378
C'est la vie, as the Romans say.

01:29:16.758 --> 01:29:19.302
On this beautiful, clear day,

01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:22.806
I think it is appropriate
that we clear the air

01:29:22.847 --> 01:29:29.979
of the toxic distortions that
my husband and, by association, myself,

01:29:30.063 --> 01:29:35.693
are somehow poisoning our environment
in our efforts to purify it.

01:29:35.777 --> 01:29:39.322
It's not true. No es verdad.

01:29:40.824 --> 01:29:42.534
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:29:42.617 --> 01:29:45.703
please help me welcome
Nick Vanderpark and Tim Dingman.

01:30:00.802 --> 01:30:02.178
Thank you.

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.890
Ladies and gentlemen, young people.

01:30:06.558 --> 01:30:09.519
I stand here with my partner,
Tim Dingman...

01:30:11.271 --> 01:30:12.856
That's right.

01:30:14.482 --> 01:30:18.528
...grateful for this opportunity
to address the central question

01:30:18.611 --> 01:30:24.200
posed in so many colorful
and eloquent variations.

01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:30.248
Where is the shit?!

01:30:33.334 --> 01:30:36.254
My God. Nick. Nick!

01:30:36.296 --> 01:30:37.964
Corky?

01:30:40.592 --> 01:30:43.887
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpark,
sorry we had to perform an autopsy,

01:30:43.928 --> 01:30:47.223
but when any large dead animal
comes in proximity with the public

01:30:47.307 --> 01:30:49.934
it must be examined immediately
for health reasons.

01:30:50.018 --> 01:30:53.104
I'm a little curious. Did you feed
your horse a lot of apples?

01:30:53.188 --> 01:30:57.442
Our neighbors have an apple tree.
Corky loved their apples.

01:30:57.525 --> 01:31:00.487
- Did he ever defecate in their yard?
- I imagine.

01:31:01.738 --> 01:31:04.949
Can you tell me what you did
when the horse defecated in your yard?

01:31:05.033 --> 01:31:09.245
We used Vapoorize
because Nick invented it.

01:31:09.329 --> 01:31:11.623
We get crates of it for free.

01:31:11.664 --> 01:31:13.416
Well...

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.585
It's all making sense.

01:31:17.754 --> 01:31:19.547
The horse was poisoned.

01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:23.635
We did find a broken shaft of
a small target arrow in the sternum,

01:31:23.718 --> 01:31:26.429
but that played no part
in the horse's death.

01:31:26.471 --> 01:31:30.975
The horse died from the prolonged
ingesting of a certain chemical,

01:31:31.059 --> 01:31:35.480
which by itself is harmless, but when
combined with certain fecal bacteria

01:31:35.522 --> 01:31:37.607
becomes a lethal poison.

01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:40.693
A little person?

01:31:40.777 --> 01:31:43.154
Lethal poison.

01:31:43.196 --> 01:31:47.826
That chemical is the ingredient in every
can of your so-called miracle invention.

01:31:47.909 --> 01:31:50.412
He had enough of it literally
to kill a horse.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.252
I am obligated, of course,
to report this to the EPA.

01:31:58.962 --> 01:32:00.547
EPA?

01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:02.090
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:02.173 --> 01:32:05.844
Environmental Protection Agency?

01:32:05.927 --> 01:32:09.347
Do you have to do that?
Right. You have to.

01:32:11.766 --> 01:32:15.562
- It's all right.
- Every time without exception?

01:32:25.739 --> 01:32:30.493
The next item, an extra
large bed that sleeps nine comfortably,

01:32:30.535 --> 01:32:32.871
for, let's say, $1 00.

01:32:32.954 --> 01:32:37.000
XL bed, sleeping nine.
Got to love it for $1 00.

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:41.796
$72 for this white statue of a man
on a horse with a spray can.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.423
$72, anyone? No?

01:32:44.716 --> 01:32:47.135
Anybody need a portable phone?
Everyone needs one.

01:32:47.218 --> 01:32:49.763
You want one in your kitchen,
in your extra bedroom.

01:32:49.846 --> 01:32:53.099
You got a portable phone right there.
It's going to go for $5.

01:32:53.183 --> 01:32:54.726
The next thing is item 31.

01:32:54.809 --> 01:32:59.189
I like this bug net. Why don't we
find out the estimated cost?

01:32:59.856 --> 01:33:05.236
Oh, we've got two cases
of a semi-gourmet flan.

01:33:05.278 --> 01:33:09.324
I believe that's some sort of
custard dish or something.

01:33:09.407 --> 01:33:13.953
The semi-gourmet flan
is going to start the bidding at $4.

01:33:14.037 --> 01:33:16.247
- Nick?
- Yeah.

01:33:18.208 --> 01:33:20.794
I think I have an idea.

01:33:20.877 --> 01:33:24.005
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like a really big idea.

01:33:24.089 --> 01:33:24.964
Really?

01:33:25.048 --> 01:33:27.634
When you got your idea,
did you feel it immediately?

01:33:27.717 --> 01:33:29.427
Oh, yeah. Right away.

01:33:29.511 --> 01:33:31.513
You got one of those?
Like one of my ideas?

01:33:31.596 --> 01:33:33.973
- I think so.
- What is it?

01:33:40.605 --> 01:33:41.898
Yes!

01:33:43.858 --> 01:33:46.528
Hey. Hey! Stop the auction!

01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:53.451
You just cannot eat flan
and drive at the same time.

01:33:53.493 --> 01:33:56.037
Look, I've got flan all over me.

01:33:56.121 --> 01:33:58.498
Can't somebody come up
with a better idea?!

01:33:58.581 --> 01:34:00.500
- We have.

01:34:00.583 --> 01:34:02.043
That's right!

01:34:02.794 --> 01:34:07.132
Be one of the millions enjoying the
taste sensation sweeping the nation.

01:34:07.173 --> 01:34:09.175
Nick's talking about Pocket Flan!

01:34:09.259 --> 01:34:10.677
Pocket Flan!

01:34:11.719 --> 01:34:14.472
- No spoon, no mess!
- That's right.

01:34:14.556 --> 01:34:15.974
Three simple steps, folks.

01:34:16.057 --> 01:34:18.226
- Just flip it!
- Flip it!

01:34:18.309 --> 01:34:20.145
- Squeeze it!
- Squeeze it!

01:34:20.228 --> 01:34:22.105
Mmm.

01:34:22.147 --> 01:34:24.691
- And enjoy.
- Enjoy!

01:34:24.774 --> 01:34:27.444
Wait a second, Tim.
What was that name again?

01:34:27.527 --> 01:34:29.487
Pocket Flan!

01:34:29.571 --> 01:34:31.072
Isn't that just fantastic?

01:34:31.156 --> 01:34:33.992
No, Nick, it's not fantastic.
It's flan-tastic.

01:34:35.535 --> 01:34:38.830
Yeah, but, Tim, Nick, I have a question.

01:34:38.872 --> 01:34:42.292
How about us
who are lactose-intolerant?

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:45.420
We've got a new soy-based Pocket Flan.

01:35:36.721 --> 01:35:38.556
It's flan in a tube.

01:35:38.598 --> 01:35:40.475
It's a little bit of happiness
in a tube.

01:35:40.558 --> 01:35:42.352
Let's say I'm jogging.

01:35:42.393 --> 01:35:46.856
I'm getting tired, I need a pick-me-up.
What am I going to do, get a candy bar?

01:35:46.898 --> 01:35:50.235
Imagine if you're jogging
with some of this stuff.

01:35:50.276 --> 01:35:52.362
What's going on?
It's not going to work.

01:35:52.404 --> 01:35:55.323
Here's the other thing.
You're eating your flan, you're like:

01:35:55.407 --> 01:35:56.408
"That's good.

01:35:56.491 --> 01:35:59.702
"l want to get down there
where it's brown and super-sugary."

01:35:59.744 --> 01:36:02.622
Where do you...? I can't...
In here we've mixed it up.

01:36:02.705 --> 01:36:04.749
You've got all that. It's pre-mixed.

01:36:04.833 --> 01:36:07.794
The brown is always part of it.
Even if you don't see it.

01:36:07.877 --> 01:36:11.548
In the Tour de France, they're going
20 miles a day, going up mountains.

01:36:11.631 --> 01:36:14.592
What do you think they pull out
of their Spandex bikini bottom

01:36:14.634 --> 01:36:17.011
to squeeze into their mouth
when they want to eat?

01:36:17.095 --> 01:36:20.432
- Pocket Flan!
- And here's another question.

01:36:20.473 --> 01:36:23.393
What if I'm doing
some skydiving and I'm like:

01:36:23.435 --> 01:36:26.062
"l got to get some...
I'm going to get some cornflakes.

01:36:26.104 --> 01:36:29.190
"l don't have time for cornflakes.
I do have time for flan."

01:36:29.274 --> 01:36:31.609
That's right.
I'd love to see this...

01:36:32.569 --> 01:36:34.195
This has been vacuum-tested

01:36:34.279 --> 01:36:37.240
to a depth of 200 feet
if you're scuba diving.

01:36:37.323 --> 01:36:40.326
Just the other day I see
this kid walking down the street.

01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:42.829
- He has the Pocket Flan. Right?
- Right.

01:36:42.912 --> 01:36:46.291
He squeezes it... he's on a skateboard.
He squeezes it...

01:36:46.332 --> 01:36:49.544
It arcs up. He goes like... and...

01:36:49.627 --> 01:36:51.629
That's like a new skateboard trick.

01:36:51.713 --> 01:36:55.049
Who here likes to drive?
You guys like to drive? Yeah.

01:36:55.133 --> 01:36:57.969
Who here likes to drive race cars?
Anybody? All right.

01:36:58.052 --> 01:36:59.929
I'm Captain Speedway,

01:36:59.971 --> 01:37:05.101
and nothing tastes better at 200 miles
per hour than Pocket Flan.

01:37:05.185 --> 01:37:09.481
Firemen. "l got to go save someone.
Maybe I need a little extra something."

01:37:09.564 --> 01:37:12.776
"Where am I gonna put my hose?
I can't hold the hose and this thing.

01:37:12.859 --> 01:37:14.861
- "Where's the hose go?

01:37:14.944 --> 01:37:17.530
"l put a hose under my arm
and then I fight the fire."

01:37:17.614 --> 01:37:19.991
This is on a serious note.

01:37:20.075 --> 01:37:26.456
Recently we received a letter
from a woman, Gladys, who...

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.417
well, Pocket Flan saved her life.

01:37:29.501 --> 01:37:32.170
- All right.

01:37:32.253 --> 01:37:35.799
She was a backpacker.
She was stuck out in the woods...

01:37:35.882 --> 01:37:38.384
and, by God, Pocket Flan...

01:37:38.468 --> 01:37:40.553
I can't think of it.

01:37:40.637 --> 01:37:44.307
I wanted to say some tearful thing,
but I couldn't think of a thing.
