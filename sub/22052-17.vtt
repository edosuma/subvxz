November 5, 1955.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.500
A very long time ago.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.500
>> SCOTT: What were you like as
a kid?

30:23.500 --> 30:26.033
>> KRIS: One of my childhood
memories is being at my

30:26.033 --> 30:30.233
grandmother's house.
That was such an amazing time in

30:30.233 --> 30:33.734
my life because it was such a
family time.

30:33.734 --> 30:36.734
It was always my grandparents
and my mom and my biological

30:36.734 --> 30:38.967
father.
And we had so much fun, and it

30:38.967 --> 30:43.600
was sort of the idyllic,
warm-and-fuzzy childhood.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.900
But my parents got divorced when
I was seven.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.900
>> SCOTT: How was that?
>> KRIS: That was really sad.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.233
>> SCOTT: Not a lot of people
know too much about your

30:52.233 --> 30:54.333
biological father.
>> KRIS: Okay, my biological

30:54.333 --> 30:56.700
dad, his name was Robert
Houghton.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.834
He moved to the Midwest because
he was an engineer, and he

30:59.834 --> 31:03.533
worked at places like Boeing
and...

31:03.533 --> 31:05.333
>> SCOTT: Boeing jets?
>> KRIS: Yeah, so he did that

31:05.333 --> 31:07.667
for many years, and his work
took him out of the city from

31:07.667 --> 31:09.266
time to time.
>> SCOTT: Wow, that's pretty

31:09.266 --> 31:11.100
cool.
>> KRIS: And then he moved back

31:11.100 --> 31:13.266
to San Diego when I was a
teenager.

31:13.266 --> 31:15.834
>> SCOTT: And then how much
longer was he involved in your

31:15.834 --> 31:19.467
life until he passed away?
>> KRIS: I guess, like, four

31:19.467 --> 31:21.333
years.
>> SCOTT: Wow, that's not that

31:21.333 --> 31:23.667
much.
>> KRIS: Four years later, he

31:23.667 --> 31:27.200
and his girlfriend at the time
went to Mexico.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.100
He was killed in a car accident.
>> SCOTT: She was with him in

31:30.100 --> 31:31.834
the car?
She survived?

31:31.834 --> 31:33.233
>> KRIS: Uh-huh.
>> SCOTT: Whoa.

31:33.233 --> 31:34.633
That's interesting, too.
>> KRIS: Yeah.

31:34.633 --> 31:35.967
>> SCOTT: I just thought he was
by himself.

31:35.967 --> 31:37.300
>> KRIS: No.
>> SCOTT: I didn't know that.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.867
>> KRIS: Yeah, they were
together in the car.

31:38.867 --> 31:41.467
>> SCOTT: Holy... Did you ever
keep in contact with her just to

31:41.467 --> 31:44.633
have any relation?
>> KRIS: I have no idea.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.266
>> SCOTT: Okay.
>> KRIS: We have to ask MJ.

31:47.266 --> 31:50.900
Wait, let's just call her.
>> SCOTT: All right.

31:50.900 --> 31:55.633
>> MJ: Hello?

31:55.633 --> 31:57.533
>> KRIS: Hi, Mom.
>> MJ: Hi.

31:57.533 --> 32:03.133
>> KRIS: So when Bob died, did I
have any contact with his

32:03.133 --> 32:06.867
girlfriend?
>> MJ: Yeah.

32:06.867 --> 32:10.166
Yeah, you went to the hospital,
and she told you what happened

32:10.166 --> 32:13.500
at the accident in Mexico.
>> KRIS: Uh-huh.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.000
>> MJ: The vehicle that knocked
them off the road just kept

32:16.000 --> 32:18.233
going.
It was, like, a semi...

32:18.233 --> 32:20.133
>> KRIS: Uh-huh.
>> MJ: ...and it just went

32:20.133 --> 32:25.900
rolling through a field.
And, um, the nuns got him out of

32:25.900 --> 32:29.867
the field, 'cause there was a
nunnery nearby.

32:29.867 --> 32:33.300
>> KRIS: Okay. All right.
Bye, Mom.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.200
>> MJ: Bye.

32:38.033 --> 32:39.834
>> KRIS: You know, obviously
when something, like, that

32:39.834 --> 32:44.200
traumatic happens in your life
and you lose a parent, that

32:44.200 --> 32:50.100
things are a little foggy.
Losing my dad was one of the

32:50.100 --> 33:01.767
most significant things that's
ever happened in our lives.

33:01.767 --> 33:05.500
>> KRIS: Losing my dad was one
of the most significant things

33:05.500 --> 33:10.300
that's ever happened in our
lives.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.700
You know, you don't have that
father--

33:12.700 --> 33:15.967
We had our stepdad as our
father figure...

33:15.967 --> 33:18.266
>> SCOTT: Right.
>> KRIS: ...who we loved so

33:18.266 --> 33:21.834
much, and he, you know, raised
us.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.567
>> SCOTT: Um, do you remember
your first crush?

33:24.567 --> 33:28.700
>> KRIS: I do. I think I was,
like, maybe 15.

33:28.700 --> 33:33.533
>> SCOTT: Hmm. Do you remember
the actual real, like, first

33:33.533 --> 33:36.700
love of your life?
>> KRIS: I think the first love

33:36.700 --> 33:39.166
of my life was when I met Robert
Kardashian.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.100
>> SCOTT: Oh, wow.
>> KRIS: Yeah.

33:41.100 --> 33:46.333
My mother had this tradition of
going to the Del Mar racetrack,

33:46.333 --> 33:49.333
and that's where I met Robert
Kardashian.

33:49.333 --> 33:52.900
I couldn't bet, because I wasn't
old enough, so I stood off to

33:52.900 --> 33:56.133
the side while everybody I was
with was placing their bets.

33:56.133 --> 34:01.433
Robert came up to me and...
asked me out.

34:01.433 --> 34:06.166
And then eventually he said,
"The day that you get out of

34:06.166 --> 34:09.567
flight attendant school and
graduate and move to New York is

34:09.567 --> 34:12.567
the same day O.J. and I are
coming to New York, because

34:12.567 --> 34:15.667
O.J.'s doing commentary at the
Olympics.

34:15.667 --> 34:19.100
And I'm really excited
to go up there and watch this

34:19.100 --> 34:23.934
young kid, Bruce Jenner, try and
win the decathlon."

34:23.934 --> 34:26.133
>> SCOTT: Robert said this?
>> KRIS: Yeah.

34:26.133 --> 34:27.834
>> SCOTT: He was at the Olympic
Games...

34:27.834 --> 34:29.500
>> KRIS: Yes.
>> SCOTT: ...that Bruce won?

34:29.500 --> 34:32.400
>> KRIS: That's right.
>> SCOTT: That is a very cool

34:32.400 --> 34:35.033
story.
What are the most important

34:35.033 --> 34:37.633
lessons you've learned in your
life?

34:37.633 --> 34:40.300
>> KRIS: To appreciate the
people that you love while

34:40.300 --> 34:42.200
they're here.
>> SCOTT: Okay.

34:42.200 --> 34:46.133
>> KRIS: Because you never know
when suddenly you might not have

34:46.133 --> 34:50.467
somebody that means so much to
you.

34:50.467 --> 34:53.467
>> SCOTT: There's definitely a
couple things that have come up

34:53.467 --> 34:56.033
that the girls have never told
me about, that I've never even

34:56.033 --> 35:00.066
heard them talk about, and if
somebody were to come to me and

35:00.066 --> 35:04.100
give me a video of my parent
telling their whole life story,

35:04.100 --> 35:07.667
I would be greatly appreciative.
So I hope the girls like it as

35:07.667 --> 35:11.867
much as I would've liked it.
>> KRIS: The fact that you had

35:11.867 --> 35:15.100
the interest to even sit down
and talk to me about what my

35:15.100 --> 35:19.400
past was like, or what I was
like when I was younger, is

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
really sweet.
>> SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I find

35:21.400 --> 35:22.900
it interesting.
>> KRIS: And I appreciate you

35:22.900 --> 35:25.700
caring about me. Thank you.
>> SCOTT: And I want my kids to

35:25.700 --> 35:28.000
know all these things.
It was a pleasure sitting down

35:28.000 --> 35:30.200
with you.
>> KRIS: Oh, it's my pleasure.

35:30.200 --> 35:37.100
Thank you for having me.

40:17.300 --> 40:21.400
that my kids don't know about me
is I had a bone tumor in my left

40:21.400 --> 40:22.967
leg.
>> KHLOE: You did?

40:22.967 --> 40:25.300
>> KIM: I knew that.
>> KHLOE: I did not know that.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.867
>> KRIS: They were gonna do a
test on it while they had my leg

40:27.867 --> 40:31.266
open, and if it came back
positive for any cancer, they

40:31.266 --> 40:33.834
would have to amputate my leg.
>> KHLOE: That's horrible.

40:33.834 --> 40:36.100
>> KRIS: And I think that's
something that really affected

40:36.100 --> 40:39.600
my mom and I.
And then, in the spring of 1973,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.433
I was 17 years old.
I actually had a boyfriend...

40:42.433 --> 40:44.567
>> SCOTT: Of course you did.
>> KRIS: ...who was always out

40:44.567 --> 40:47.734
of town; his name was Caesar.
So, while he was living on the

40:47.734 --> 40:52.500
road, I met Robert Kardashian.
>> KHLOE: Ooh!

40:52.500 --> 40:54.734
Hussy.
>> KRIS: Robert came over one

40:54.734 --> 40:58.066
day when Caesar was out of town.
>> KHLOE: What? Mom!

40:58.066 --> 41:00.667
Were you hooking up with him?
>> KRIS: Yeah.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.967
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God!
You're such a whore.

41:02.967 --> 41:05.467
Now we know where we get it
from.

41:05.467 --> 41:10.233
>> KRIS: And then we went back
to Caesar's house, and lo and

41:10.233 --> 41:13.867
behold, Caesar came home to
surprise me. So...

41:13.867 --> 41:15.667
>> SCOTT: And
>> KRIS: Well, it wasn't

41:15.667 --> 41:17.367
pretty.
>> SCOTT: Did they get into a

41:17.367 --> 41:19.200
fistfight?
>> KRIS: I'm not proud of it.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.967
Actually, Caesar tried to grab
his sweater-- I think he ripped

41:21.967 --> 41:23.800
a hole in Robert's sweater.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.367
I didn't want to ever hurt
anybody's feelings.

41:26.367 --> 41:29.300
>> KHLOE: "I just wanted some
dick while Caesar was out of

41:29.300 --> 41:33.734
town."
>> KIM: Oh, my God.

41:33.734 --> 41:36.100
I cannot believe Scott made
this legacy video.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.500
>> KHLOE: I think it's so sweet.
>> KIM: And so sweet.

41:38.500 --> 41:42.066
>> KHLOE: So much I think we
think we know about Mom, but we

41:42.066 --> 41:45.000
really don't.
This is my mom's time to shine.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.767
I think all she ever wants is to
feel like all the attention's on

41:48.767 --> 41:51.266
her and that, like, we really
are listening and care about her

41:51.266 --> 41:53.767
as her children, so it's cute to
see her that excited.

41:53.767 --> 41:57.734
>> KIM: Yeah, she was really
excited.

41:57.734 --> 42:01.500
>> SCOTT: What do you hope for
your kids and your grandkids?

42:01.500 --> 42:06.834
>> KRIS: I hope that they
understand and appreciate the

42:06.834 --> 42:12.867
value of having this big, huge
enormous family...

42:12.867 --> 42:17.400
and that they all stick together
and figure out how to go through

42:17.400 --> 42:20.400
life together and to support
each other.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.300
>> SCOTT: Very nice.
>> KRIS: Yeah.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.867
>> KHLOE: Yay!

42:24.867 --> 42:31.767
I do think it's super...

42:31.767 --> 42:34.400
just smart of Scott.
'Cause even that made me think

42:34.400 --> 42:36.533
about Dad.
Like, man, I wish we did this

42:36.533 --> 42:39.633
with Dad and just had it, so in,
like, 20 years, like, in 20

42:39.633 --> 42:42.233
years, we might forget half
the stuff about Mom and watch

42:42.233 --> 42:45.000
it and just, you know,
remember all over again.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.266
>> KRIS: Thank you so much for
taking the time to do that for

42:48.266 --> 42:50.600
me, so my kids will have it
and learn a little something

42:50.600 --> 42:52.300
about me.
>> SCOTT: It was a lot more

42:52.300 --> 42:54.633
time than that comes out to, by
the way.

42:54.633 --> 42:56.800
It looks easy.
I was out there hours.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.900
>> KRIS: But the lighting.
I got to work on...

42:58.900 --> 43:00.233
>> KHLOE: Scott, work on your
lighting.

43:00.233 --> 43:02.066
>> SCOTT: I know.
It was the first time I was in

43:02.066 --> 43:03.233
production.
>> KRIS: Yeah.

43:03.233 --> 43:05.066
>> KHLOE: No, but in general,
you're a sloucher.

43:05.066 --> 43:07.667
>> KIM: You should've just taped
it up behind your neck.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.800
>> KHLOE:  What?
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.400
>> SCOTT: You can do that?
>> KHLOE: Tape your neck?

43:12.400 --> 43:15.066
>> KRIS: Ouch.
>> KIM: On the next episode...

43:15.066 --> 43:17.233
>> KOURTNEY: So, I've been
thinking about freezing my eggs.

43:17.233 --> 43:18.900
>> KIM: Are you serious?
You want another kid?

43:18.900 --> 43:20.934
>> KOURTNEY: I should just do
it so I don't have to think.

43:20.934 --> 43:23.100
Is this why I want to have kids?
It's, like, putting too much

43:23.100 --> 43:25.233
pressure.
My name is Miranda.

43:25.233 --> 43:27.500
>> KRIS: My name is Miranda.
>> KHLOE: My name is Miranda.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.200
>> SCOTT: What the  is
going on here?

43:29.200 --> 43:31.533
just got a tip that

43:31.533 --> 43:33.533
you're pregnant.
It's just really unfortunate for

43:33.533 --> 43:35.467
Khloe 'cause she's not ready to
talk about it.

43:35.467 --> 43:37.333
>> KHLOE: You want to tell
people yourself.

43:37.333 --> 43:40.467
It's just, like, people take all
of that away from you.
