[gun cocks]

22:00.235 --> 22:01.737
[Johnny] We can't do this.

22:04.531 --> 22:07.075
Never point a gun at a man's back, Johnny.

22:09.077 --> 22:09.995
What are we doing?

22:11.204 --> 22:12.748
Look at yourself. Look at us.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.624
What the hell are we doing here?

22:16.668 --> 22:18.879
You have to stop.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.049
I can't let you do this anymore.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.675
I do this for us.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.469
Once I have the cure--

22:25.469 --> 22:27.387
There is no cure.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.183
It failed. Dr. Singh failed.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.601
Then he'll start again.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.686
I let him go, Doug.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.857
- Then I will find another Dr. Singh.
- You don't get it.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.527
There is no cure and there never will be.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.364
Let the kids go.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.159
You have to let the kids go,
and you have to let me go.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.243
I've had enough.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.290
It's over,

22:56.291 --> 22:58.919
and everyone can see it but you.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.422
It's never over, Johnny.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.259
You don't get it, do you?

23:07.260 --> 23:09.054
It's not about Dr. Singh,

23:09.054 --> 23:12.099
it's not about the cure,
it's not about the virus.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.184
Winning.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.605
That's all there ever really is.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.565
[ominous music playing]

23:20.565 --> 23:22.526
Maybe that's what separates me

23:23.527 --> 23:24.528
from you

23:25.737 --> 23:29.950
and the millions
who were too weak to survive.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.412
I tried to teach you, Johnny.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.332
But you just refuse to understand,

23:37.999 --> 23:39.584
at the end of the day,

23:40.252 --> 23:43.839
it's about who has what it takes to win.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.310
It was for your safety, John.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.858
I would never hand you a loaded gun.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.237
I don't think I could live with myself
if you had an accident.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.573
Come here.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.951
Come here, it's okay.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.789
[Johnny whimpering]

24:20.292 --> 24:21.293
[Abbot] It's okay.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.465
You want to go?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.844
You can go.
There's nothing more I can teach you.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.183
You don't need me anymore.

24:37.642 --> 24:38.477
Let him go.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.013
[resounding thud]

25:22.896 --> 25:24.648
[Abbot] Bury him when this is over.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.276
Make it nice.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.153
We're not animals.

But she's sick.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.381
- We should go back and fight.
- Absolutely not.

Look, I promised your mom
that I would keep you safe.

I was saving the last crossbow for you,
but that dude snuck up on me.

I guess we're both unarmed.

do that thing you do.

I know it seems like
fighting is the only answer.

for those you care about.

Maybe, maybe not. What you gonna do?
