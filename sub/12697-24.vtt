WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.738
{\an8}-Okay.
-To wrap up this webcast--

00:04.804 --> 00:06.072
{\an8}Each of us
is gonna paint a picture

00:06.139 --> 00:07.874
{\an8}in only 10 seconds.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.442
{\an8}And then you,
the "iCarly" viewers,

00:09.509 --> 00:11.211
{\an8}are gonna vote online
for whose painting is best.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.046
{\an8}Now guess
what we're gonna paint on.

00:13.113 --> 00:17.183
{\an8}It's our wacky,
little friend, Gibby.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.287
{\an8}Are you ready there, Gibby?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.123
{\an8}Sure. Whatever.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.196
{\an8}Ten seconds on the clock.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.232
{\an8}And go.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.403
{\an8}Try not to move.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.704
{\an8}Hold still, Gibby.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.039
{\an8}-Five seconds.
-The brushes tickle.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.378
{\an8}Time.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.479
{\an8}Okay.

00:46.546 --> 00:50.550
{\an8}Now here's my painting.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.419
Who's that? Freddie?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.854
No, it's a clown.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.824
Oops. Sorry, clown.

00:59.492 --> 01:02.128
And now, let's take a look
at Sam's painting.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.502
Okay,
I have no idea what that is.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.304
It's a meatball.

01:11.371 --> 01:15.108
Yes, Sam has painted her dream.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.709
Okay.
Till the next "iCarly."

01:16.776 --> 01:17.877
Bye. Ciao.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.779
See you.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.248
-And we're clear.
-Whoo.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.184
Hey, you should go
rinse the paint off first.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.518
You're gonna ruin your shirt.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.020
Who cares about my shirt?

01:27.086 --> 01:28.488
Who cares about anything?

01:28.555 --> 01:29.589
Not me.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.592
What's wrong?

01:32.659 --> 01:34.894
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-Good.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.896
Who's up for chicken wings?
I know I am.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.567
Gibby, seriously,
what's the matter?

01:44.237 --> 01:46.272
Shannon Mitchell, okay?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.847
What about Shannon?

01:53.913 --> 01:55.381
What's the prob?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.550
I want her to like me,

01:57.617 --> 01:59.686
but every time
I try to talk to her,

01:59.752 --> 02:01.421
I get all shy.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.824
Why does she have to be
so cute?

02:04.891 --> 02:06.226
I'm goin' home.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.627
Gibby--

02:08.695 --> 02:10.395
I don't wanna talk about it.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.900
Aw, poor kid.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.134
It must be awful
to love someone

02:15.201 --> 02:16.569
who doesn't love you back.

02:19.405 --> 02:20.373
Sorry.

Hey, Gibby.

03:30.476 --> 03:31.711
What's up?

03:34.147 --> 03:36.349
We came up with a great way
to set you up with Shannon.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.483
How?

03:37.550 --> 03:38.985
On the next "iCarly,"

03:39.052 --> 03:40.420
we're gonna play a game
called "I win a date."

03:40.486 --> 03:42.322
-"I win a date"?
-Yeah.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.424
And you're gonna be
the special mystery date.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.327
And we're gonna get Shannon
to be one of the contestants.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.828
So that way--

03:50.863 --> 03:52.231
Who's your friend

03:52.298 --> 03:54.434
and why is he staring at me
like a freak?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.302
Oh, this is Reuben.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.437
Sorry.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.672
It's like you were
born sideways

03:59.739 --> 04:02.108
over the moon
with 2 1/2 scoops.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.077
Zipang.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.379
Okay, I think
I gotta punch this kid

04:06.446 --> 04:07.847
in the mouth.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.184
Wait, I think
he might be complimenting you.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.554
Was that a compliment?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.755
Hey, just 'cause
I bump the chump

04:16.822 --> 04:19.759
doesn't mean
I lost my bingo trap.

04:19.826 --> 04:22.028
That is so true.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.036
No. No.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.272
Stephanie, I really don't think
we should go out again.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.077
Come on, I didn't say
I had a bad time last night.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.713
It's just-- Stephanie--
Step-- Steph--

04:40.780 --> 04:43.850
because I don't like you.
[groans]

04:44.617 --> 04:48.955
So, I guess your blind date
went pretty well last night.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.157
She brought her pet
unicorn to dinner.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.992
There's no such thing
as unicorns.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.827
Try telling her that.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.231
I'm just gonna stay single
the rest of my life.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.667
They'll call me
"Single Spencer,"

05:00.733 --> 05:02.902
the guy with no lady to hold.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.872
Why don't you try
one of those dating websites

05:05.938 --> 05:07.540
like whynotdateme.com,
you know,

05:07.607 --> 05:10.910
where lonely adults
find even lonelier adults?

05:11.778 --> 05:13.379
Sounds so tempting.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.748
At least you get to see a video
of the person

05:15.815 --> 05:17.083
before you go on a date.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.818
Yeah, but those websites
are just so--

05:18.885 --> 05:21.187
[phone ringing]

05:21.254 --> 05:22.488
Hello?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.556
Stephanie.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.824
Stephanie--

05:24.891 --> 05:27.894
No, I will not speak
to your unicorn.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.364
Because he's not real.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.399
That website again?

05:38.938 --> 05:39.906
Hey, Shannon.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.507
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.242
So, listen, you guys wanna be
on the next "iCarly"?

05:43.309 --> 05:44.610
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.212
What are we gonna do?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.914
Well, let's just say one of you
is gonna win a date

05:47.980 --> 05:49.148
with an awesome guy.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.084
-Freddie?
-I said "awesome guy,"

05:51.150 --> 05:53.319
not "ridiculous goob."

05:53.386 --> 05:56.022
I think Freddie
is cute and smart.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.157
Okay,
what'd you eat for breakfast?

05:58.224 --> 05:59.992
A big bowl of crazy flakes?

06:01.494 --> 06:04.464
There's my raspberry
soccer ball.

06:05.998 --> 06:09.235
And speakin' of crazy flakes,
it's you.

06:16.509 --> 06:20.213
[humming]

06:23.349 --> 06:24.684
Hello there.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.553
My name is Spencer Shay.
Hello.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.389
I've never used an Internet
dating service before,

06:30.456 --> 06:32.358
but my sister told me
about this one,

06:32.425 --> 06:33.659
whynotdateme.com.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.229
So, why not date me?

06:36.295 --> 06:38.064
[laughs]

06:38.798 --> 06:40.466
I enjoy people.

06:42.034 --> 06:43.302
What are you doing?

06:43.369 --> 06:45.104
Making a video
for whynotdateme.com.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.506
Give me the remote.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.544
What's wrong?

06:51.611 --> 06:52.945
You're not being you.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.747
You gotta be looser.

06:54.814 --> 06:55.848
How do I not look--

06:55.915 --> 06:58.050
Your shirt should be out,

06:58.117 --> 07:00.253
these buttons should be undone,

07:00.319 --> 07:02.355
and your hair needs
some of this.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.025
There.

07:07.126 --> 07:08.761
What did you put in your hair?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.963
-Chicken fat.
-Oh, my God.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.940
Gibby,
ready to play "I win a date"?

07:21.007 --> 07:22.475
Shannon's really in there?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.576
Right through that door.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.945
Man, this is intense.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.781
Just remember,
all your voices are gonna be

07:28.848 --> 07:30.283
electronically disguised.

07:30.349 --> 07:31.450
Why?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.219
To keep your identities
a mystery.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.388
Then how will I know
which one is Shannon?

07:35.454 --> 07:37.456
-She'll be girl number--
-You can't just tell him.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.692
We have to keep
the game real and fair.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.327
But what if I don't pick
Shannon?

07:41.394 --> 07:45.131
Listen, there'll be
three girls out there.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.999
Girl number one,

07:47.066 --> 07:50.870
girl number two,

07:50.937 --> 07:52.672
and girl number three.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.174
But how will I know
which one is Shannon?

07:57.276 --> 08:01.247
If you really want two
go on a date with Shannon,

08:01.314 --> 08:05.551
then you need two
choose carefully.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.688
That's all you have two--
Two--

08:08.754 --> 08:10.156
do.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.527
Okay.

08:15.494 --> 08:18.164
Hey, you guys
better come in here.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.832
Be right back.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.200
-What?
-What's up?

08:21.267 --> 08:24.370
Um,
Celine and Julia aren't coming.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.372
-What?
-Why aren't they coming?

08:26.439 --> 08:29.375
They got tickets
to see "Girly Cow on Ice."

08:29.442 --> 08:31.878
Why is it that whenever
there's a popular TV show,

08:31.944 --> 08:34.547
they just gotta go
put it on ice?

08:34.614 --> 08:37.149
Guys, we have seven minutes
to figure out

08:37.216 --> 08:38.650
how we're gonna play
"I win a date"

08:38.717 --> 08:42.087
without girl number one
or girl number three.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.358
Oh, Freddie,
you're so good at math.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.097
Well, let's hope he's good
at hosting a game show.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.032
Pardon?

08:55.234 --> 09:00.506
And one, two, three, four, go.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.242
Hello there.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.077
My name's Freddie,
and here tonight

09:05.144 --> 09:07.413
on this special webcast
of "iCarly,"

09:07.480 --> 09:09.782
we're gonna play
a new game called--

09:09.849 --> 09:11.851
"I win a date."

09:11.918 --> 09:15.021
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

09:15.087 --> 09:16.923
Okay. First, let's meet
our mystery date.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.191
Now, keep in mind,
his voice has been disguised

09:19.258 --> 09:21.861
so that our girl contestants
won't recognize him.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.629
Hello, mystery date.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.232
[deep voice] Hi.
It's great to be here, Freddie.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.435
And now,
let's meet our three girls.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.138
Remember, their voices
have also been disguised.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.240
Hello, girl number one.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.943
[high-pitched voice] Hello,
Freddie, nice to see you.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.078
Wow, my voice sounds so weird.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.814
[high-pitched silly noise]

09:41.881 --> 09:43.983
That's so cool.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.751
Nice to see you.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.221
And girl number two.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.090
[high-pitched voice]
Hi, Freddie.

09:54.593 --> 09:57.129
And, uh, girl number three.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.700
[deep voice] Hey, Fredward.
How's it hangin'?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.271
And those are the three girls
competing to win a date

10:05.338 --> 10:06.639
with our mystery man.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.507
Whichever girl he picks
will join him

10:08.574 --> 10:12.078
on a romantic dinner for two
at the Cheesecake Warehouse.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.448
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

10:15.514 --> 10:16.916
Awesome.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.852
Now, mystery man,
you ask the questions,

10:19.919 --> 10:21.887
listen to the girls'
answers carefully,

10:21.954 --> 10:23.656
and then, when it's all over,

10:23.723 --> 10:25.958
it will be up to you
to choose your girl.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.326
Begin.

10:27.393 --> 10:30.763
Okay. Girl number one.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.298
Yes?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.868
What is your favorite type
of music?

10:38.637 --> 10:41.240
What's your least favorite?

10:42.241 --> 10:43.576
I guess rap.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.511
Oh, well, I love rap.
Yeah, rap music.

Cool.

girl number three?

Okay.
Where is girl number three?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.275
Mmm.

for one final question.

Cool. Girl number two.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.157
how would you wake me up
in the morning?

11:31.223 --> 11:34.126
Well, I'd say,
"Wake up, sleepy head,"

11:34.193 --> 11:36.729

a super nice breakfast in bed.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.066
Sweet.

Girl number one,

"Get up and go get a job,

11:45.404 --> 11:48.474
you lazy sack,"

11:48.541 --> 11:50.843

-I set you up with Reuben.
-Why would you--

Because he wanted
to go out with you

16:08.901 --> 16:10.436

with Gibby for three hours.

so much about computers?

that nine-minute video

22:30.682 --> 22:31.883
of me eating cereal,

22:31.950 --> 22:34.853
the one you and Sam said
was so lame?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.388
Which it was.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.390
Well, I put it up
on whynotdateme.com

22:38.457 --> 22:40.959
and guess who's already
got nine responses?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.162
Wow. So, you got nine dates
comin' up.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.597
Well, no.

22:45.664 --> 22:49.101
See, these four are
from women in prison.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.602
Ah.

22:50.669 --> 22:51.903
And these three are from women

22:51.970 --> 22:53.605
who recently got out of prison.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.273
Interesting.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.942
And these two are
from psychologists

22:57.008 --> 23:00.212
{\an8}who feel that they
can...help me.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.547
{\an8}Nice.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.016
{\an8}-What about that one?
-Oh, that one is new.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.618
{\an8}Hey, she's kind of pretty.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.353
{\an8}-That's a dude.
-Oh.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.527
Hi.
I'm Samantha and my talent

23:15.594 --> 23:17.963
is making
really cool animal noises.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.297
Check it out.

23:19.364 --> 23:20.832
[barking]

23:20.899 --> 23:23.034
[clucking]

23:23.101 --> 23:26.605
[howls]

23:26.671 --> 23:28.907
[bleating]

23:28.974 --> 23:32.177
[meowing]

23:32.244 --> 23:34.379
Bye. Thanks for listening.
