00:30.720 --> 00:34.550
Our deepest desires are never simple.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.590
But the peace we find when they are met

00:37.640 --> 00:39.600
eclipses everything.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.550
Rhythm restored,

00:42.600 --> 00:45.430
a familiar face returned,

00:45.480 --> 00:49.040
the fresh new ticking
of a clock once stopped.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.470
When wishes are granted,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.040
joy comes gently.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.550
And when it is not, we hang suspended,

01:00.600 --> 01:06.080
waiting for release in the
space between the heartbeats.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.550
If you've been following the
instructions on the pamphlet

01:16.600 --> 01:19.750
I had specially Roneoed for you
before I left for South Africa,

01:19.800 --> 01:23.870
you shouldn't have any trouble
at all with these new exercises.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.470
Good evening, Barbara!
Better late than never.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.630
Retained placenta in Lisbon Buildings.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.230
In which case you're excused.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.110
And we're going to step to the side,

01:32.160 --> 01:34.960
swinging our heads down to the floor.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.110
Roses?

01:40.160 --> 01:41.830
I'm sorry they're pink.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.750
- They didn't have any red ones.
- I prefer pink anyway.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.310
How are the children?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.710
They're looking after each other.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.190
We're all looking after
each other, really.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.990
It's you I worry about.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.630
I know.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.390
Is everything... as it was?

01:58.440 --> 02:01.040
There's been no further bleeding.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.270
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

02:04.320 --> 02:06.710
but visiting hour is
finishing early tonight.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.350
- We've got ten minutes to go!
- Then you can go and catch an early bus,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.230
or drop into the Flag and
Whistle and have half a beer.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.070
I've a new patient to see to,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.470
and all my ladies need
settling in for the night.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.670
That's us told, then.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.430
Will you come back tomorrow?

02:22.480 --> 02:25.580
I'd sleep in the corridor
if they'd let me.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.550
The reason this exercise is
called The Flamingo is because

02:37.600 --> 02:40.430
whilst one leg bears the
entire weight of the body,

02:40.480 --> 02:42.590
the other is fully extended behind.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.270
It's not because we're
all turning pink, then?

02:45.320 --> 02:47.670
As you swing each leg behind you,

02:47.720 --> 02:51.590
fling the arms open like wings,

02:51.640 --> 02:53.750
pushing forwards with the bust!

02:53.800 --> 02:55.520
Oh, gosh!

02:59.160 --> 03:02.110
You might do better leaning on this chair.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.790
Barbara, would you come to the front

03:03.840 --> 03:05.870
and demonstrate to the rest of the class

03:05.920 --> 03:08.590
whilst I check everybody's balance?

03:13.760 --> 03:17.230
I'd like the whole class to look
at Barbara's lovely supple back

03:17.280 --> 03:18.950
and confident bust projection!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.630
This is at least partly because Barbara

03:21.680 --> 03:24.510
has come to the class wearing
suitable undergarments,

03:24.560 --> 03:29.430
namely a soft, elasticated
brassiere and sensible briefs.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.150
Anything more substantial than
a lightweight panty corselet

03:33.200 --> 03:36.630
is going to seriously affect your
ability to carry out these moves.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.910
Is that why you're out of breath, then?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.120
No, it is not!

03:45.960 --> 03:48.510
I really don't like putting
you to trouble, Sister.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.350
I'm a nurse myself, and I
know this isn't your job.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.990
If you're a nurse, you know not
to argue with your superiors.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.350
And if you choose not to use a bed pan,

03:57.400 --> 03:59.910
you can't choose who
wheels you to the lavatory.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.790
I don't choose not to. I just
find it almost impossible...

04:03.840 --> 04:05.350
No upsetting yourself.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.720
Upsetting yourself is the worst
thing you can do. So I forbid it.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.990
Fiery Jack! Active
ingredient: capsicum pepper.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.110
My mother swore by it for her fibrositis.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.110
I haven't got fibrositis,
Phyllis! I'm just unfit!

04:23.160 --> 04:25.910
And the rest of the
class were just as bad.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.390
I don't think one of them had
even looked at the exercises

04:28.440 --> 04:31.310
- in that pamphlet, never
mind done any! - Did you?

04:31.360 --> 04:33.950
I was very busy in South Africa.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.190
Did you get any exercise on board ship?

04:36.240 --> 04:39.390
I played giant chess.
Almost every afternoon.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.190
And I won a twist competition
with the Chief Engineer.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.910
Well, that should've firmed your
upper arms and trimmed your flanks.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.110
S'not a laughing matter, Barbara!

04:47.160 --> 04:49.470
I've let myself down and my class.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.990
And I'm going to put it right.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.070
See that Mrs Turner has all she needs,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.390
then I must talk to you
about the sluice room.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.380
Yes, Sister Douglas.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.630
She's very kind.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.750
If you keep on the right side of her.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.590
Nurse? I'm really sorry, but I
need the toilet and I'm too scared

05:10.640 --> 05:12.670
to move in case the bleeding starts again.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.520
Don't worry. I'll fetch you a bedpan.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.430
It's my third time in here.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.870
First time I managed to hang
on for as long as six months.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.400
I'm only five months.
But I'm hanging on, too.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.310
Ow!

05:42.360 --> 05:43.760
Ooh!

05:56.040 --> 05:59.910
♪ You are so fantastico

05:59.960 --> 06:02.910
♪ I'm a lucky so and so... ♪

06:02.960 --> 06:05.070
Why don't you join me?

06:05.120 --> 06:08.350
My wake-up routine can be
your wind-down before bed.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.230
Trixie, I've been jumping through
hoops all night for Sister Douglas.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.280
I don't need any more exercise, thank you.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.470
Nurse Crane.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.510
Early bird catches the worm.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.390
Or, at least, it gets all the
worms lined up and identifies

06:27.440 --> 06:30.670
which is likely to cause the most trouble.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.230
Drawing up this roster is
like trying to plait soot.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.110
In which case, you'll be delighted
to hear that we've received

06:39.160 --> 06:42.390
permission and funds
to engage a new midwife.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.360
- We're going to advertise in
the Midwives Chronicle. - Oh!

06:50.120 --> 06:52.990
- Morning, Marnie!
- Oh, I was just going out.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.590
Oh, do have mercy on a
poor, shattered midwife.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.870
I really don't want to have
to bike all the way back

06:57.920 --> 07:00.830
with a delivery pack
perched on my handlebars.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.760
Mandy, go back in.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.870
Do make sure you have

07:06.920 --> 07:09.990
enough shillings put by for
the gas and electricity meter.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.190
A candlelit birth sounds romantic,

07:12.240 --> 07:15.470
but I've attended several and
they can be quite trying.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.350
Is the lavatory at the
end of the corridor?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.990
You probably smelled it on your way in.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.670
I-I beg your pardon, Nurse,
but I really need to go now

07:22.720 --> 07:24.230
or I'm going to be late.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.150
- I'm sorry, I didn't realise you
had an appointment. - Well, I have!

07:28.200 --> 07:30.160
I'm due in court.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.150
I bought stuff on HP
before me husband left.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.320
And once I realised he was never
coming home, I ran up loans.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.830
I'm going before the magistrates
cos I defaulted on the payments.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.480
- There are people you could've asked for help.
- Well, I didn't, did I?

07:54.120 --> 07:56.790
Let me help you to get the
children as far as the bus stop.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.990
It's the least I can do
after I've made you late.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.550
I'm sorry, I-I shouldn't've
snapped, Nurse.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.990
Well, I shouldn't've
been such a bossy boots.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.030
I've been away for months,

08:09.080 --> 08:12.200
and I was probably enjoying
myself a little bit too much.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.670
My kids always have hankies on 'em.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.030
One of the things my
gran was strict about.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.590
I've got out of the habit of it myself.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.070
I never seem to have time
for all the little things

08:26.120 --> 08:27.830
that make you look respectable.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.680
You look perfectly respectable to me.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.190
Good morning, Mrs Turner.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.630
I'm just going to ease
you over into this chair

08:36.679 --> 08:40.039
so that we can tidy up,
ready for Mr Kenley's rounds.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.789
All right?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.910
Oh.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.710
No. No...

08:51.760 --> 08:53.910
It's all right.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.030
Come and sit down. Come and sit down.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.470
I know Marnie Wallace is a
churchgoer and I thought

08:59.520 --> 09:02.230
you'd want to be told that she
might need some pastoral care.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.510
Thank you.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.750
I'm aware she's on her own, of
course, and I saw her on Sunday,

09:06.800 --> 09:10.430
but she never mentioned
anything about a court case.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.270
It's the shame, probably.
The more ashamed people are,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.270
the less inclined they
are to ask for help.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.950
Yes. And the more they need it.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.070
I'll call and see her.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.230
Patient is an elderly primigravida,

09:24.280 --> 09:26.470
aged 36,

09:26.520 --> 09:29.830
almost five months gestation.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.390
Admitted after a moderate bleed,

09:32.440 --> 09:34.870
further bleeding earlier
today, now ceased.

09:34.920 --> 09:38.550
Patient was successfully treated
for pulmonary tuberculosis

09:38.600 --> 09:41.950
using triple protocol some four years ago.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.310
Why might that mean that conception was...

09:47.360 --> 09:48.900
unexpected?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.870
Damage to the pelvic organs, perhaps?

09:54.920 --> 09:59.030
Possibly leading to problems
in carrying a pregnancy to term?

09:59.080 --> 10:03.510
I was diagnosed with scar tissue
in the ovaries and fallopian tubes.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.390
But once I actually managed to conceive,

10:05.440 --> 10:07.830
there was no reason to
anticipate further problems.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.830
- You seem to be very well
informed, Mrs...? - Turner. - Ah.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.710
I'm a midwife by profession,

10:13.760 --> 10:16.950
and I know there are always new
developments in obstetrics.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.150
If we could try to find out
why this is happening...

10:20.200 --> 10:23.870
Pregnancies click, or they don't.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.790
Let's just watch

10:25.840 --> 10:28.190
and wait,

10:28.240 --> 10:29.640
shall we?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.990
Kiddies need somewhere to play,

10:42.040 --> 10:45.550
and now they've demolished the
reservoir there's proper grass there

10:45.600 --> 10:47.990
and a little hut where
they sell ice creams.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.270
I remember Tom saying something about it.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.390
Isn't there going to be a grand opening?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.910
Well, an opening.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.590
The Mayor's on his holidays,
so I wouldn't call it grand.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.190
Violet's borrowed a maypole to
do something with the Brownies,

10:59.240 --> 11:01.870
but the Cubs, they've
gone to hell in a handcart

11:01.920 --> 11:03.470
since Nurse Mount went off.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.230
I could give a presentation
with my Keep Fit Ladies.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.070
It would give us all such an incentive,

11:08.120 --> 11:10.310
and we'd draw quite a
crowd with our leotards.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.590
Leotards? In a public park?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.870
Oh, Trixie, what would
Sister Julienne say?

11:14.920 --> 11:17.470
If you aren't going to take
keep fit seriously, Barbara,

11:17.520 --> 11:21.150
then you might as well give it up
and run the Cubs in your spare time.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.830
I don't have any spare time.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.870
Why don't you take 'em on, Nurse Crane?

11:25.920 --> 11:29.190
Because I find small boys exasperating.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.670
And violent.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.230
That's why a good Akela's so essential --

11:33.280 --> 11:36.390
to stop them turning into
exasperating and violent men.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.750
And how's that going to be accomplished?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.510
By waving a magic wand?

11:40.560 --> 11:43.840
Ah! They sell whistles
down the hardware shop.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.110
I just...

11:50.160 --> 11:53.400
I can't make ends meet, on
just National Assistance.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.430
And now the courts are saying I have
to pay back my debts in instalments.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.070
Would it help if I went through
your bank account with you?

12:02.120 --> 12:06.390
I haven't got a bank account. My
husband wouldn't give me permission.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.830
Hello, Marnie, sweetheart.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.910
Hello, Dot.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.510
- You her vicar?
- Curate, yes.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.870
I'm her cousin.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.510
She asked me to be godmother to
this little love, but I declined.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.520
Don't believe in God, or in the devil.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.390
Come here!

12:25.320 --> 12:27.510
Got pink icing all over your face.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.160
Looks like lipstick put on wrong.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.350
Hankie. Never go without one.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.670
Our grandma would be proud.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.630
There, that's better, isn't it?

12:39.680 --> 12:43.230
Anyway, it's really Master
Kevin I've come to see today.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.550
Cos he's the birthday boy!

12:47.360 --> 12:49.310
Shall I unwrap it?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.430
- It's a cap gun.
- Dot!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.830
I'm not celebrating
Kevin's birthday today.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.750
I can't afford to buy him anything,

12:55.800 --> 12:58.390
and he's too little to know any better!

12:58.440 --> 13:01.320
- Is it that bad?
- Yes, it is.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.630
Begging your pardon, Reverend,

13:05.680 --> 13:09.030
but Marnie knows me and my Eugene
would bend over backwards to help.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.750
Dot! I don't want the kind of
help you and Eugene are offering,

13:12.800 --> 13:15.270
do you hear me? I don't want it.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.510
But you need it, Marnie. You
need all the help you can get.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.360
Go! Just go, Dot. Get out of my
flat, and just leave us all alone.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.630
As it happens,

13:28.680 --> 13:32.430
internal examination
has given me confidence

13:32.480 --> 13:35.750
in a diagnosis of incompetent cervix.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.710
What does that mean?

13:37.760 --> 13:41.630
It means there's a reason why you
keep losing all these babies.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.310
The neck of the womb lacks
the muscularity it needs

13:44.360 --> 13:46.670
to hold everything in place.

13:46.720 --> 13:51.670
Nurse, are you able to recall the
name for the treatment for this?

13:51.720 --> 13:56.310
Cervical cerclage, sir? Often
referred to as a Shirodkar Suture.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.230
It's a stitch put into the
cervix following threatened

13:59.280 --> 14:02.630
spontaneous abortion, usually
removed in the 36th week

14:02.680 --> 14:05.390
to allow for natural labour and delivery.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.240
"Though she be but little, she is fierce!"

14:10.320 --> 14:12.550
Could you do that for me?

14:12.600 --> 14:15.600
I'm prepared to give it my consideration.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.470
I think this one will suffice.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.560
I should like the Scouting
Association discount, please.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.550
Trixie chose the magazines.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.360
Nurse Crane sent barley sugars.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.600
I... I just spoke to the Sister.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.110
She told me you had a setback.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.110
It wasn't a very heavy loss.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.950
Enough to suggest the
baby may no longer be alive

15:12.000 --> 15:14.670
but not enough to know for certain.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.700
Do you want to know for certain?

15:20.280 --> 15:22.430
If I did...

15:22.480 --> 15:25.070
we may have to stop hoping.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.910
And we were without hope
of any kind for years.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.470
We were happy enough before

15:31.520 --> 15:35.630
and we will be happy
again, whatever happens.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.560
- We will, won't we?
- Yes.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.910
Good news, Marnie!

15:46.960 --> 15:50.230
I've persuaded the council
nursery to find afternoon places

15:50.280 --> 15:53.190
for Kevin and Mandy for
the next six weeks.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.070
That came this morning.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.990
From the landlord.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.710
The rent man's been knocking
on the door for weeks,

16:01.760 --> 16:03.670
and I just haven't answered.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.520
"Notice To Quit"?

16:06.760 --> 16:09.100
I didn't read on after that.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.710
I didn't dare.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.390
How long have I got?

16:18.440 --> 16:19.910
Two weeks.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.910
I thought Tatler was
supposed to be a gossip mag.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.750
It's not gossip if you've never
heard of any of the people.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.710
Mind you, you can't fault
the soft furnishings in it,

16:39.760 --> 16:41.750
there's some magnificent pelmets.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.150
Any time you fancy swapping pelmets

16:44.200 --> 16:47.760
for "20 Exciting Things To Do With
Liver" you're more than welcome.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.870
Every time those doors swing open, I
look to see if it's that specialist,

16:56.920 --> 16:59.190
coming to tell me he'll do that operation.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.710
Still,

17:00.760 --> 17:03.590
at least there's no chance of
us missing these babies moving,

17:03.640 --> 17:06.670
when we're lying here, nailed to the bed.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.190
I haven't felt mine move at all yet.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.950
I wouldn't expect to -- it's too soon.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.950
It's too soon to hear a heartbeat either,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.510
- even if there's one there to be heard.
- Just you wait.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.270
If they let you listen through
the stethoscope, it sounds like

17:20.319 --> 17:23.589
a horse coming in over
the finish line in a 3:15.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.339
It must be a magical thing
when it's your own baby.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.630
What does it feel like
when it starts to move?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.590
It's not like kicking.

17:33.640 --> 17:37.670
Well, maybe it feels like kicking
later on, but I wouldn't know.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.630
You know what it does feel like,
at six months, where I am now?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.470
Like a goldfish.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.110
Yeah, like a little goldfish,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.270
nudging the side of his
bowl with his little fins.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.630
"I'm in here, Mum!"

17:48.680 --> 17:51.070
You'll be feeling it yourself
soon. I know you will.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.160
And yours will have its
boots on, kicking up a storm.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.390
Excuse me, lovely.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.270
Hello, Marnie. This is a surprise.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.240
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have shouted.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.070
You don't mind us coming here, do ya?

18:16.120 --> 18:18.870
It's just that I remembered it was
early closing at the beauty parlour.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.360
Ring the bell. Go on.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.110
There's a choice of two tunes,
just flick a little switch.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.640
Dot...

18:32.240 --> 18:35.240
I've come to talk to you about your offer.

18:43.560 --> 18:47.160
I wish Eugene was here. He's
at his salon, seeing a supplier.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.870
Sugar?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.390
One and a bit.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.310
- It's lumps. You have
to have one or two. - Dot.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.310
Does Eugene know?

18:56.360 --> 18:58.070
About your offer?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
Yes.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.190
He never wanted to adopt...

19:05.240 --> 19:07.710
when we realised I was barren.

19:08.840 --> 19:12.640
He said he wanted his own
flesh and blood or nothing.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.590
And I put it to him...

19:15.640 --> 19:18.830
that your little one
was the next best thing.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.750
He knows I asked you.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.040
And he knows you said no.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.910
Well, as I said,

19:26.960 --> 19:28.790
I'm saying yes now.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.760
You can take it -- as soon as it's born.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.910
We'll give it everything, Marnie.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.560
- It'll be the child we never had.
- It'll be the child you do have, Dot.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.620
It'll be yours.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.110
The Midwives Chronicle's arrived,
Sister. The advertisement's in.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.350
It feels rather exciting, really.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.150
As though we've launched our
little ship on a new adventure.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.870
I can't shake off the feeling
that this new person --

19:59.920 --> 20:04.350
whoever she may be -- is really a
replacement for Sister Mary Cynthia.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.600
Who could fill her shoes?

20:07.360 --> 20:11.630
She is a very particular
and gentle spirit,

20:11.680 --> 20:14.590
and I suspect I miss her
at least as much as you do.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.670
Then why aren't we trying to find her?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.910
Well, cos she isn't lost.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.990
She was very unwell when she was
returned to the Mother House,

20:22.040 --> 20:26.030
and since you reported that she was
not there, Mother Jesu Emmanuel

20:26.080 --> 20:29.990
informed me that she has been
sent to a place of greater safety.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.750
Sister Mary Cynthia is
a person, not a parcel.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.830
She shouldn't be "returned"
or "sent" anywhere.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.510
She should be acting of her own free will.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.310
She was in no fit state to do so.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.870
If you had seen her, you would
believe me when I say that.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.270
I don't disbelieve you. I just
need to know she's all right.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.390
Until Sister Mary Cynthia
is well enough to choose

20:51.440 --> 20:55.550
to make contact with us herself,
we must treat her with the respect

20:55.600 --> 20:59.430
we would show to anyone
else who isn't well.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.800
Especially if the illness is a mental one.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.680
Mrs Wallace?

21:13.960 --> 21:15.590
I've sorted everything out.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.670
I'd be pleased...

21:17.720 --> 21:20.590
if you weren't crying as you said that.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.550
What you playing at, Fred Buckle?

21:35.600 --> 21:39.070
I thought of the perfect way to get
everybody down the new playground,

21:39.120 --> 21:40.790
on the day of the opening.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.950
"Spectacular Chariot Race

21:43.000 --> 21:46.030
"From Market Cross to Reservoir Rec.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.430
"Prams, carts, wheelbarrows.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.630
"No conveyance too humble or too grand!"

21:51.680 --> 21:53.310
Is that what all this is, then?

21:53.360 --> 21:56.950
Yeah, well... it's to
give people ideas. Look!

21:57.000 --> 21:58.270
Look.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.070
"Bigger than Ben Hur!"

22:01.120 --> 22:04.420
I'd better start stocking
Roman helmets, then.

22:07.480 --> 22:10.670
I've never come across
a case quite like it.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.590
Mrs Wallace has made up her mind,

22:12.640 --> 22:15.430
and seems to believe that
God approves of her actions.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.310
If I may venture an observation,

22:18.360 --> 22:23.310
when people seek the approval of the
Almighty, it is generally because

22:23.360 --> 22:25.470
they fear they will not get it.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.910
Sister, you know as well as I do
that many poor women have given

22:28.960 --> 22:31.950
children they cannot feed to
relatives better placed to do so.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.350
And we have never condemned them.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.350
It happens with slightly older
children. But I can't remember

22:37.400 --> 22:39.350
it ever happening with such a new-born.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.070
Nurse Franklin, we look after
mothers giving new-borns

22:42.120 --> 22:45.150
- up for adoption every week.
- And not many of them would

22:45.200 --> 22:47.790
if society gave them much
choice in the matter.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.910
I've mopped up more tears and
dried up more milk supplies

22:50.960 --> 22:52.990
than you can shake a stick at.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.520
Adoption is always a very
delicate and complicated issue.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.320
I was adopted myself,
when I was two months old.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.630
Well, I'm sure that will
make you much more sensitive

23:08.680 --> 23:11.630
- to Mrs Wallace's situation.
- I hope so.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.150
I don't know what
happened when I was born.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.430
But my adoptive parents were wonderful,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.270
and I've never doubted that
my mother did her best for me.

23:19.320 --> 23:22.270
And we'll do our best
for this poor mother.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.520
Every care taken and no questions asked.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.480
I know that landlord.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.630
He terrorised me and Dot
when we were first married.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.230
Gives me quite a thrill,

23:38.280 --> 23:41.470
writing him a cheque with
my gold-nibbed fountain pen.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.190
You remind me of that nursery rhyme,

23:44.240 --> 23:46.790
"The king was in his counting house."

23:46.840 --> 23:50.140
I shall have to brush
up on my nursery rhymes.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.030
It'll be all hands on deck in a minute.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.750
I called in at the furniture shop,
they're delivering a nice roll

23:55.800 --> 23:58.750
of lino and a brand-new
mattress as we speak.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.310
The van's pulling up already.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.390
I don't need a new mattress, Dot.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.110
Marnie, the one you've
got sags in the middle

24:05.160 --> 24:07.670
like Old Nick's hammock!

24:07.720 --> 24:11.670
I still wish you were coming
to have the baby at our house.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.830
But this is your home.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.990
And whatever you want, you can have.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.350
You can even have a say in naming it.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.950
No.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.940
It'll be your baby.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.870
I like Andrew for a boy.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.430
Same as Prince Andrew.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.280
And something ending in A for a girl.

24:38.800 --> 24:43.390
I think it's starting. I was
sick with Kevin and with Mandy.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.240
Do you want me to ring Nonnatus House?

24:52.480 --> 24:55.070
And skip, skip, step to the side,

24:55.120 --> 24:57.270
skip, skip, step to the side.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.720
And if you bump into
somebody, just keep going.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.000
Pack, alert!

25:09.800 --> 25:12.430
I thought you were coming
earlier, Nurse Crane.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.990
We were delayed.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.990
I thought it best to spend some time

25:16.040 --> 25:19.070
revising basic commands and responses.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.990
I had an aunt with half
a dozen Sheltie pups,

25:22.040 --> 25:24.150
she took a similar tack with them.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.270
Well, you've still to convince
me that mixing the sexes up

25:27.320 --> 25:29.720
around the maypole will work.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.680
Pack, at ease.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.750
I've just found a blackcurrant jelly
and a tin of evap on the step.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.110
Another kindly patient must've put
them there after Mrs Penny left.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.510
She says there's a hotpot in the oven,

25:47.560 --> 25:49.830
and she's coming back
later, for Angela's bedtime.

25:49.880 --> 25:54.150
- No prizes for guessing
what's for pudding! - Dad.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.990
You don't have to pretend
to be jolly all the time.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.350
You don't have to pretend
that nothing's happening.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.230
With your next pain, I want you
to push with all your strength.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.750
Really show me what you can do.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.990
No noise, Marnie. Save
your energy for that push.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.150
Help! Help!

26:22.440 --> 26:24.990
It's like it doesn't
want to be born, Nurse.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.830
All right, sweetie.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.480
We're going to get you some help.

26:30.960 --> 26:34.070
Dot, could you telephone Poplar 491,

26:34.120 --> 26:36.950
and say Doctor Turner and another
midwife are needed at this address

26:37.000 --> 26:38.910
for an assisted delivery?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.960
- Will you be all right on your own?
- Absolutely we will.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.870
Dad, I know it makes
sense to shield Angela

26:51.920 --> 26:54.790
but it doesn't make sense to shield me.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.100
I'm sorry, Tim.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.150
But we're just marking time and waiting.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.440
For all we know, there might not
be anything to shield you from.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.870
Have you done your homework?

27:07.920 --> 27:11.270
I do it every night when
you're at the hospital.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.150
Maybe when I'm 18 we can
go to the pub and have

27:14.200 --> 27:16.470
- a proper conversation.
- Go to the pub?

27:16.520 --> 27:18.790
That's where men go to talk, isn't it?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.710
I've only got three more years to wait.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.350
Hello, Turner.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.200
Sister Winifred.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.630
I see.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.840
Yes, of course, I'll be there
straight away. Thank you. Goodbye.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.060
I have to go out to a case, son.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.350
I'm sorry.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.510
How are we getting along?

27:52.560 --> 27:55.270
Baby seems to be in a good
anterior position, but Mrs Wallace

27:55.320 --> 27:58.070
has been in the second stage for a
couple of hours without progress.

27:58.120 --> 28:01.060
- She's very tired.
- I'll examine her.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.350
But let's prepare for forceps.

28:21.320 --> 28:25.030
Good evening, Master Turner.
What are you doing here?

28:25.080 --> 28:28.750
I think a policeman would describe
me as loitering with intent.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.950
Mum won't have any
visitors if I don't go in

28:31.000 --> 28:33.950
- but no-one under 16 is allowed.
- Well, no-one's been asked to show

28:34.000 --> 28:37.200
their birth certificate
while I've been here.

28:39.440 --> 28:44.750
Now, once we're all set, I'll need
you to push with each contraction.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.110
I'm tired of pushing.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.510
But the difference now, Marnie,
is that you'll be pushing,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.110
and Doctor will be pulling.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.710
You'll have your baby in
your arms before you know it.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.350
You can push with the next one,
Marnie. Save your strength.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.000
First blade.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.900
And the second.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.950
Contraction.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.870
Deep breath and push!

29:06.920 --> 29:09.480
Push, Marnie, push!

29:11.400 --> 29:14.720
- Come on! Come on, girl.
- You can do it!

29:17.000 --> 29:20.400
- And again.
- You're doing so, so well, Marnie.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.080
- Head's on the way!
- Nearly there!

29:36.520 --> 29:38.430
Push now!

29:38.480 --> 29:42.870
- Keep it coming, Marnie!
Keep it coming! - Good girl!

29:42.920 --> 29:45.230
That's it! That's it!

29:45.280 --> 29:47.150
That's it!

29:49.280 --> 29:50.710
Well done.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.630
Well done, Marnie.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.700
It's a boy.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.070
Did you hear that?

30:08.120 --> 30:09.590
Thank you.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.310
Thank you.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.590
He's a man, he doesn't find it
easy to talk about his feelings.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.750
But he's also a doctor.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.870
You'd think he'd find it easier
to talk about this than most men.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.870
Timothy, does it not occur to you

30:26.920 --> 30:29.870
that that's why he can't discuss things?

30:29.920 --> 30:32.860
He knows what could happen. And so do I.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.830
He's going to look like a
prize fighter by tomorrow.

30:38.880 --> 30:43.910
I predict at least one black
eye and very possibly two.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.910
I'm sorry, soldier.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.150
Time for a little someone's
wash and brush up!

30:49.200 --> 30:52.140
Let's introduce him to his mother first.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.480
Give him to Dot.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.840
Give him to her.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.320
Oh, look at you.

31:16.400 --> 31:21.310
Look at you, looking at me, as if to say,

31:21.360 --> 31:23.520
"How did I get here?"

31:25.400 --> 31:28.110
It's been ever such a long, long journey.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.360
But you're here now.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.080
Sshhh.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.350
What's happening?

31:43.400 --> 31:46.030
I'm putting this Nil-By-Mouth
sign over your bed, Mrs Venables,

31:46.080 --> 31:48.710
because in the morning you're
going to be having an operation.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.470
Are they going to put that stitch in?

31:50.520 --> 31:52.790
Mr Kenley has decided
you're a prime candidate

31:52.840 --> 31:54.710
for cervical cerclage.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.280
Nurse Busby will pop by in a few
minutes to help you to prepare.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.230
Hello, son. Mrs Penny's gone.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.950
She told me where you were headed.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.150
Thank you.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.600
I thought you might be angry.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.350
Some rules are worth breaking.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.350
Others, you are going to
have to stick to for a while.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.710
Like not going to the pub.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.630
- Beer? - To be precise,
two bottles of Pale Ale

32:28.680 --> 32:32.360
and a packet of pork scratchings.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.190
Are you going to stay with them tonight?

32:39.240 --> 32:41.150
Absolutely.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.910
Marnie's had quite a rough time,

32:43.960 --> 32:47.160
and baby might be grisly
because of his sore head.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.480
I have to go home and tell my husband.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.120
We'll come back to get the baby
in the morning, in the car.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.270
We can bring his carrycot.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.920
All his lovely new clothes.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.840
We'll be a family from the off, then.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.940
Poor sweet.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.550
Are you sure you don't want to see baby?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.910
Sister Winifred's about
to give him a bottle,

33:20.960 --> 33:24.790
but I could bring him in here
just so you could have a peep.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.670
I want him christened.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.070
As soon as possible.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.630
Baby's not in any danger, Marnie.
He's just a little bruised.

33:31.680 --> 33:35.380
You'd feel reassured if you
just took a look at him.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.390
You could give him his bottle
yourself, if you'd like to?

33:38.440 --> 33:41.150
I just want him christened.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.470
First thing in the morning.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.710
Dad, that was miles off bull's-eye.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.350
Dad, thanks -- for this.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.230
Tim...

34:07.280 --> 34:09.949
whatever happens with this baby,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.270
family life won't change.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.350
But I'll change.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.790
You've been changing for 15 years.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.239
And I love you just the same.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.590
Nurse!

34:33.639 --> 34:35.350
Nurse!

34:35.400 --> 34:36.909
Something's happening!

34:36.960 --> 34:38.429
Stay where you are, Mrs Venables!

34:38.480 --> 34:41.630
No! No! I'm supposed to be
having my operation this morning!

34:41.679 --> 34:44.750
- Is something wrong?
- I think she's in labour.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.710
Not again, not again.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.989
Make it stop! Make it stop!

34:51.040 --> 34:54.199
Make it stop! Please!

34:57.600 --> 35:00.630
In the name of God...

35:00.680 --> 35:03.710
the Father, the Son

35:03.760 --> 35:05.700
and the Holy Spirit.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.040
- Amen.
- Amen.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.510
Marnie, I'm going to say
the godparent's responses.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.680
But it is usual for the mother
to hold her baby until that point.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.720
There you go. Sh...

35:36.960 --> 35:40.470
Please don't think I don't
love him, Mr Hereward.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.720
I've never doubted that
for a single moment.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.590
You only have to be brave
a little bit longer.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.310
It'll be over very quickly.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.190
I don't want it to be over!

35:53.240 --> 35:56.670
- Lean into me, Gloria. Do as Sister says.
- I don't want to push!

36:02.000 --> 36:04.400
- Good girl.
- No...

36:07.240 --> 36:09.040
Name this child.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.560
Andrew...?

36:15.720 --> 36:18.350
Andrew Thomas.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.340
After the reverend.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.670
Andrew Thomas,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.710
I baptise thee in the name of the Father,

36:34.760 --> 36:36.910
and of the Son,

36:36.960 --> 36:39.030
and of the Holy Ghost.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.430
Amen.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.200
Amen.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.110
Good girl.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.990
Soon this will all be over.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.000
And there'll be no more pain.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.630
- Is it alive?
- No.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.080
No, dear.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.040
I'm sorry.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.100
You see to this, Nurse.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.160
Mrs Venables and I can
manage on our own now.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.520
Noooo!

37:49.240 --> 37:52.320
I'll pop to the kitchen and prepare
a bottle for Master Andrew.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.160
Unless you want to try
feeding him yourself?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.510
I don't want him messed about.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.990
Of course.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.440
Morning.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.910
Is something wrong?

38:07.960 --> 38:12.310
No. Marnie just wanted
the baby to be baptised.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.270
I don't believe in any of that.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.260
That's why I did it.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.040
He's called Andrew Thomas.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
You can take him now.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.150
What will happen to my baby?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.710
Don't you worry about that now.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.750
You leave that to us --
that's what we're here for.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.540
- No, I wanted to see it!
- I know.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.100
But it wouldn't be wise.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.750
You can cry if you want to.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.460
There will be better days than this.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.750
If these are the best interview
candidates the Midwives Chronicle

39:19.800 --> 39:23.630
can deliver to our door, I have
to say I fear for our profession.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.030
Is there anyone on the list you
feel we really shouldn't see?

39:27.080 --> 39:30.830
Mantlewood, Geoffrey Arnold
rather leaps off the page.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.550
Yes. He would appear to be a man.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.950
But he's highly qualified
as a district nurse.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.070
Sister Julienne, more than
half of our work is midwifery.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.270
A field in which men are not currently

39:42.320 --> 39:44.790
permitted to train or qualify.

39:45.920 --> 39:51.430
I would also like to draw your
attention to Gretchen Elise Fruman,

39:51.480 --> 39:56.030
who appears to spring from somewhere
called Vermillion, South Dakota.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.520
I thought an American would
be a breath of fresh air.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.870
So no Americans.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.460
And no men.

40:08.600 --> 40:13.600
All the bottles and powdered
milk are packed and in the car.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.320
So, looks like we're ready for the off.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.870
Come on, then, little lad.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
Your carriage awaits.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.400
Wait.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.510
He can't go without an 'ankie.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.980
Give it to him.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.630
Take this from your mother, Andrew.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.560
And may God's love go with you always.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.110
Did I do the right thing, Mr Hereward?

41:33.160 --> 41:35.670
Tell me honestly, did
I do the right thing?

41:35.720 --> 41:38.590
I'm not even going to answer
that question, Marnie.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.230
Because you did the only thing you could.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.950
Thank you for being so kind to me.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.630
It must've been quite hard.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.470
It wasn't hard at all.

41:50.520 --> 41:53.390
Have you been in this situation before?

41:54.440 --> 41:57.040
I've been in this situation once.

42:01.200 --> 42:06.120
Is there anything else I
can do for you before I go?

42:07.320 --> 42:09.430
I want to get rid of the pram.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.910
Kevin's not a baby any more.

42:11.960 --> 42:16.060
I was only pushing him round
in it to keep it warm for...

42:16.440 --> 42:18.240
.. the next one.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.070
Now I need someone to take it away.

42:32.280 --> 42:35.550
Tom? How did it go?

42:35.600 --> 42:37.160
He's gone.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.270
Tom... this isn't your story.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.470
You've always said you couldn't've
had a happier childhood,

42:45.520 --> 42:47.520
or a better life.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.350
That was before I witnessed
a woman giving up her child.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.110
Before I was in the
room watching her crying.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.310
What about her story?

42:57.360 --> 42:58.830
I'm sorry.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.360
There are no photographs of me as a child.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.540
I didn't think I minded.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.750
But now I've seen one.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.200
And I do.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.510
If Dr Turner was a Girl Guide,

43:21.560 --> 43:24.830
he'd get his Needlework
Badge for those stitches.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.070
But you really are going
to have to stay in bed

43:27.120 --> 43:28.510
or you might tear again.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.230
We could transfer you to the
maternity home or hospital,

43:31.280 --> 43:34.310
you could have a proper rest,
away from your children.

43:34.360 --> 43:37.560
Why would I want to be

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
- Can they come in now?
- Of course.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.630
- ♪ I love you so

44:59.640 --> 45:02.310
I thought I'd escort that
last one to the door.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.670
I'm quite sure she realised
that she'd been unsuccessful.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.790
She was trilling like Tweetie Pie

45:07.840 --> 45:11.230
all the way to the bottom of the stairs.

45:11.280 --> 45:14.110
Today's layer cake assumes the form

45:14.160 --> 45:17.630
of coffee and walnut sponge.

45:17.680 --> 45:21.390
Since the maker's hand moved
freely with the flavourings,

45:21.440 --> 45:24.910
I consumed my portion earlier,

45:24.960 --> 45:27.870
lest it render me wakeful tonight.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.950
Thank you, Sister. Do
pour us all a cup of tea.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.150
Nurse Crane, most of our new recruits

45:35.200 --> 45:37.470
- are like fish out of
water to begin with. - Yes.

45:37.520 --> 45:42.630
And whole weeks get wasted while
they flap around gasping for air.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.630
We need someone who can
roll their sleeves up,

45:45.680 --> 45:49.830
and not collapse when
they see an East End privy.

45:49.880 --> 45:54.710
None would disagree who have
toiled in these environs.

45:54.760 --> 46:00.430
The trouble is nursing treats
young working class girls

46:00.480 --> 46:02.230
the way the world treats women.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.750
They're all over them
when there's a war on.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.990
Afterwards, nobody wants to know.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.510
Thank you.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.640
Shelagh? Shelagh?

46:27.240 --> 46:30.390
You must've seen babies that
lived as long as mine did.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.310
Yes.

46:32.360 --> 46:35.350
Do they have fingers and toes?

46:35.400 --> 46:37.000
Yes, they do.

46:38.280 --> 46:41.630
I feel stupid asking but
when I ask the nurses,

46:41.680 --> 46:44.390
it's like it wouldn't
do me any good to know.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.270
And it does do me good.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.920
I'm glad.

46:51.200 --> 46:54.030
They say my milk will come in tomorrow.

46:54.080 --> 46:57.280
Then they'll have to dry
it up using Epsom salts.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.160
That is what's usually advised.

47:03.840 --> 47:06.110
You'd think your body would
know better than to make milk

47:06.160 --> 47:09.460
for a baby who could
never live, wouldn't you?

47:11.200 --> 47:12.400
Yes.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.870
Hello, Mr Spenlow. Have
you been to see Marnie?

47:27.920 --> 47:31.870
Not yet. Dot's been having thoughts.

47:31.920 --> 47:35.800
About the way ahead, and how we
ought to proceed. Can I come in?

47:38.080 --> 47:40.270
What do they mean, "a private adoption"?

47:40.320 --> 47:43.470
It's when a baby is handed
directly by the mother

47:43.520 --> 47:45.350
to the adoptive parents,

47:45.400 --> 47:47.870
rather than going through
a charity or an agency.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.310
But that's what we're
already doing, isn't it?

47:50.360 --> 47:54.150
A formal private adoption
would involve paperwork.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.740
And it would be legally binding.

47:57.720 --> 48:00.270
Does that mean I couldn't change my mind?

48:00.320 --> 48:02.590
I'm afraid it does, Marnie.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.470
Is this what is known as a "lady's glass"?

48:36.520 --> 48:38.230
Yes, it is.

48:38.280 --> 48:40.350
It practically had cobwebs on.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.590
I did dust it.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.350
You strike me as a young
woman of very high standards.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.270
That's what the Army does
for you. And nursing.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.950
Being an Army Nurse makes
you twice as particular.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.040
Miss Dyer, why did you
resign from military service?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.990
It was all so...

49:01.040 --> 49:05.030
efficient, in a way
that wasn't always good.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.710
Plenty of curing. Not
quite so much caring.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.230
I thought I'd be bored by now.

49:12.280 --> 49:16.670
But it's as if going away made me
look at Poplar through fresh eyes.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.390
Even on the day of that explosion,
I didn't want to be anywhere else.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.830
It was the way people pulled together.

49:23.880 --> 49:26.710
It was the way you cared
that caught my eye.

49:26.760 --> 49:30.070
And why I thought you might
be interested in my offer.

49:30.120 --> 49:32.750
Miss Dyer, all you have to do

49:32.800 --> 49:35.200
is write and apply formally.

49:37.880 --> 49:41.270
I appreciate I've rather
put you on the spot.

49:41.320 --> 49:43.230
By all means take some
time to think about it.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.910
Oh, I don't need any time
to think about it, Sister.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.400
I'll be applying today.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.630
Marnie. You shouldn't be out of doors.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.680
I wanted one bit of paperwork
that I could call my own.

50:01.840 --> 50:05.160
So I went down to the Town
Hall and I registered the baby.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.750
And when I signed it...

50:08.800 --> 50:10.740
I knew I wanted him.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.120
I'm so sorry, Gloria.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.590
I've got this idea in my head

50:30.640 --> 50:33.550
that next year, or the year after,

50:33.600 --> 50:35.750
it'll be a lovely sunny day,

50:35.800 --> 50:39.280
and I'll be down Chrisp
Street Market, pushing a pram.

50:40.640 --> 50:43.950
And somewhere near the flower stall,
I'll look up and I'll see you...

50:44.000 --> 50:46.390
pushing a pram.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.790
And we'll smile,

50:48.840 --> 50:51.310
and we'll pass the time of day.

50:54.040 --> 50:56.710
That would be lovely, wouldn't it?

51:07.640 --> 51:09.590
I knew.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.990
I knew as soon as I heard that
tune on the ruddy doorbell.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.510
You always had a way of
pressing doorbells really hard

51:15.560 --> 51:19.670
when we was kids, playing
Ring The Bell And Run Away.

51:19.720 --> 51:22.910
Except you're not going to
run away this time, are ya?

51:22.960 --> 51:24.790
Marnie knows what she wants, Dot.

51:24.840 --> 51:28.990
Oh, well! We'll have to hand him
straight over then, won't we?

51:29.040 --> 51:30.950
Marnie is Andrew's mother, Dot.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.470
But what's she got to give him?

51:33.800 --> 51:36.630
And please don't say love.

51:36.680 --> 51:40.760
I'm so full of love for him, it's...
it's spilling out of me like water.

51:42.240 --> 51:45.040
And it's spilling out of me like milk.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.510
Somebody take him!

52:18.880 --> 52:21.510
Thank you for looking after him.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.960
Oh, he'll need his hankie.

52:27.320 --> 52:29.120
You keep it, Dot.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.870
I'm sorry.

52:56.880 --> 53:00.190
We're going to listen for baby's
heartbeat today, Mrs Turner.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.670
Now?

53:01.720 --> 53:04.150
I wanted a particular doctor...

53:04.200 --> 53:07.280
and he has a very busy schedule.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.280
Shelagh.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.870
Afternoon, Mr Spenlow.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.630
Reverend.

54:37.680 --> 54:39.950
Has this been made redundant?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.430
Well, we bought all this
stuff for the little fella.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.750
And we want him to have it.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.790
Some of this is my fault.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.840
I said I wouldn't adopt from an orphanage.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.950
Didn't want a stranger's child.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.270
You live and learn, don't you?

55:00.160 --> 55:04.270
Mr Spenlow, I can introduce you to
someone from an adoption agency.

55:04.320 --> 55:06.460
When the time is right.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.500
Well, when Dot's stopped crying.

55:23.760 --> 55:27.680
- One for you. - Thanks, Danny. Drinks
on the house if I've won the pools!

55:44.040 --> 55:46.670
During the summer of 1962

55:46.720 --> 55:49.790
there was joy in the sunlit streets

55:49.840 --> 55:52.030
around Nonnatus House.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.710
The opening of the recreation ground

55:54.760 --> 55:58.350
restored something to the
soul of the district.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.830
People were given a place to gather,

56:00.880 --> 56:04.710
room to play, a space to share.

56:04.760 --> 56:09.470
Sometimes the heart desires
such very simple things.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.710
The heart holds within it

56:11.760 --> 56:13.830
all that is most precious,

56:13.880 --> 56:16.080
all that we must protect.

56:23.920 --> 56:28.230
Ready... steady...

56:28.280 --> 56:30.830
But it is also braver and bolder,

56:30.880 --> 56:33.230
more resilient than we realise.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.040
If we wound it, it will heal.

56:43.040 --> 56:47.120
And if it breaks, it learns to beat again.

56:49.040 --> 56:52.510
One of the great doctors of the
Roman Empire once described

56:52.560 --> 56:57.350
the heart as "a source and
hearthstone of the inborn heat

56:57.400 --> 57:01.390
"by which we are all
governed. "It is," he wrote,

57:01.440 --> 57:04.630
"Made of hard flesh not easily injured.

57:04.680 --> 57:08.790
"In vigour, tension, general
strength and resistance to injury,

57:08.840 --> 57:13.830
"the fibres of this organ
far surpass all others,

57:13.880 --> 57:18.390
"for no other instrument
performs such continuous,

57:18.440 --> 57:22.040
"hard work as the heart."

57:23.440 --> 57:27.080
Nurse Dyer. Welcome to Nonnatus House.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.950
Why have you brought him here?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.070
He's simple. He needs proper care.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.870
Together we're going to
save the borough's teeth.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.270
I must get back to Sister Winifred.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.870
She'll be thinking Nurse
Franklin's run me out of town.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.510
We must instruct our troops!

57:41.560 --> 57:44.040
An innocent is in danger!
