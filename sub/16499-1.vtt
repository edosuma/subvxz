01:01.021 --> 01:03.816
That's right.
Come on. No, don't stop.

01:09.115 --> 01:10.489
Keep looking!

01:12.618 --> 01:14.913
You don't feel so good now, do you?

01:15.997 --> 01:17.998
See, you let it out. Out!

01:27.510 --> 01:29.095
I feel like an idiot.

01:29.553 --> 01:31.764
Not so fast, not so fast. Slower.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.515
Slower.

01:34.098 --> 01:35.893
Good, good.

01:37.103 --> 01:38.896
Keep it specific.

01:39.106 --> 01:41.314
Still a little tension in the mouth.

01:41.607 --> 01:43.026
Good, good.

01:43.610 --> 01:45.904
Okay, make her work peripherally.

01:51.617 --> 01:52.911
Michael...

01:53.205 --> 01:53.996
...Dorsey, is it?

01:54.621 --> 01:55.999
Yes, that's right.

01:56.625 --> 02:00.212
Mr. Dorsey, would you turn
to page 23, please?

02:00.713 --> 02:03.923
Yes, I believe you mean
the first scene...

02:04.131 --> 02:05.800
Sorry, the second scene
of the first act.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.514
Second scene of the first act. Right.
Begin when you're ready.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.806
Yes, of course.

02:17.105 --> 02:20.524
Oh, sweetheart, do you know what
it was like waking up in Paris...

02:20.733 --> 02:23.319
...seeing the empty pillow where...

02:23.612 --> 02:28.200
Wait! Cover your breasts. Kevin is
downstairs! My God, what are you?

02:28.617 --> 02:31.993
I'm a woman. Not Felicia's mother.
Not Kevin's wife.

02:32.704 --> 02:35.623
Thanks very much.
We need someone a little older.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.795
Mom! Dad! Uncle Pete, come quick!

02:40.213 --> 02:43.299
Something's wrong with Biscuit!
I think he's dead!

02:43.632 --> 02:45.633
We're looking for someone younger.

02:45.718 --> 02:49.930
"They have dinner..." Can I start again?
I didn't get kicked off right.

02:50.723 --> 02:53.100
The reading was fine.
You're the wrong height.

02:53.225 --> 02:54.811
I can be taller.

02:55.229 --> 02:57.314
No. We're looking
for somebody shorter.

02:58.231 --> 03:00.902
Look. I don't have to be this tall.

03:01.109 --> 03:04.030
See, I'm wearing lifts.
I can be shorter.

03:04.697 --> 03:07.617
I know, but we're looking
for somebody different.

03:07.701 --> 03:08.619
I can be different.

03:09.702 --> 03:11.538
We're looking for somebody else.

03:12.204 --> 03:14.623
What do you care more
about than working?

03:14.708 --> 03:18.128
The part's the most important thing.
But love sometimes is too.

03:18.629 --> 03:22.216
With improvisation, you're the writer.
When somebody writes a play...

03:22.716 --> 03:26.219
...they decide where the highs are,
where the lows are. Now you do it.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.515
And you may not be high where
they're high in the writing.

03:29.723 --> 03:31.726
You may not be low where they're low.

03:32.226 --> 03:35.815
You may be high on "but."
You may be high on "and."

03:36.231 --> 03:38.128
Of course, they were doing it
for dough...

03:38.164 --> 03:40.025
...the same as everybody
does it for dough.

03:40.819 --> 03:43.321
But the question is in
the last analysis.

03:43.738 --> 03:46.116
What were they doing for dough?

03:46.699 --> 03:50.203
You and me were advancing our
little non-Prussian careers.

03:50.830 --> 03:54.708
So when all hell broke loose,
and the Germans ran out of soap...

03:55.210 --> 03:59.505
...and figured, "What the hell?
Let's cook up Mrs. Greenwald!"...

03:59.715 --> 04:01.717
...who the hell do you
think stopped them?

04:08.305 --> 04:11.101
Pardon me, is my acting
interfering with your talking?

04:11.226 --> 04:13.812
Don't play a part that's not in you.

04:14.229 --> 04:18.524
Don't say "he" or "she" like you did
last week when you were doing Kitty.

04:19.235 --> 04:21.112
When you were doing
Time Of Your Life.

04:21.237 --> 04:23.532
If you can't make the part yourself,
you can't play it.

04:24.741 --> 04:25.534
Sergeant.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.201
Quick! Get a priest!

04:27.827 --> 04:29.168
No, sergeant, no priest.

04:29.204 --> 04:31.539
- But you're dying, Count Tolstoy.
- I know.

04:31.707 --> 04:34.417
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost...

04:34.834 --> 04:36.838
...I commit your soul to God.

04:38.714 --> 04:40.924
- My friends...
- That's super, Michael.

04:41.216 --> 04:45.930
But I wonder if you could move center
stage on that speech, and then die.

04:48.308 --> 04:49.141
Why?

04:49.308 --> 04:51.645
The left side of the house
can't see you.

04:55.815 --> 05:00.029
You want me to stand up and walk
to the center of the stage...

05:00.320 --> 05:01.905
...while I'm dying?

05:02.823 --> 05:06.118
I know it's awkward,
but we'll just have to do it.

05:06.243 --> 05:09.330
- Why?
- I just told you. Now do it!

05:09.831 --> 05:10.915
Because you say so?

05:11.334 --> 05:12.917
Yes, love.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.835
Not with me as Tolstoy.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.339
You gotta work.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.219
There's no excuse for not working.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.513
There's no excuse.
There's unemployment.

05:23.846 --> 05:27.140
There was unemployment when
my friends and I started acting.

05:27.307 --> 05:28.516
And it's not changed.

05:29.309 --> 05:32.730
You got 90-95% unemployment.
It's never going to change.

05:32.813 --> 05:34.942
You're an actor.
You're in New York.

05:35.316 --> 05:38.612
There is no work.
But you gotta find ways to work.

05:39.111 --> 05:42.032
Two tortellinis,
a gazpacho with two salads.

05:42.324 --> 05:46.119
Ordering: Veal chop, medium,
two scrods, an order of chicken!

05:46.328 --> 05:47.913
One scrod underdone.

05:48.413 --> 05:50.332
- What's the rest?
- Baked potato.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.211
- How'd it go?
- Terrible.

05:52.334 --> 05:55.129
- Did you rewrite the last scene?
- I did the necktie scene.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.339
How is it?

05:56.839 --> 05:59.050
It'll change theatre as we know it.

05:59.342 --> 06:01.636
We'll work on it
when we get home tonight.

06:01.845 --> 06:02.929
That's my flounder.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.350
- That is my flounder.
- Robber!

06:05.433 --> 06:07.851
- Ordering: One flounder...
- That's for the customer!

06:08.435 --> 06:12.314
I eat these things so if the
customers ask if I eat his food...

06:12.939 --> 06:15.318
...I can say, "Yeah, I eat his food."

06:17.445 --> 06:19.740
You rewrote the necktie scene? Good.

06:19.948 --> 06:22.325
- Without the necktie?
- With the necktie.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.619
- With the necktie?
- Yeah, with the necktie.

06:24.953 --> 06:29.125
The necktie's wrong. You take the
necktie out, you got something.

06:29.916 --> 06:32.337
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

06:32.420 --> 06:35.548
What's wrong is it's depressing
to be disagreed with.

06:35.923 --> 06:37.131
It's depression.

06:37.925 --> 06:41.136
Today's your birthday,
and you haven't mentioned it.

06:41.345 --> 06:45.225
Don't start. I'm a character actor.
Age has no effect on me.

06:45.934 --> 06:48.728
- That's very good.
- How does one not be depressed?

06:48.853 --> 06:53.150
Instead of trying to be Michael Dorsey,
the great actor or the great waiter...

06:53.442 --> 06:55.444
...why not just try to be
Michael Dorsey?

06:55.945 --> 06:58.155
I am Michael Dorsey.
What's the payoff?

06:58.446 --> 07:02.451
- Say it like you mean it.
- I am Michael Dorsey. Fine. Okay?

07:02.951 --> 07:04.828
Surprise!

07:11.919 --> 07:13.547
Speech! Speech! Speech!

07:13.923 --> 07:16.717
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute.

07:16.925 --> 07:17.842
First a toast.

07:17.925 --> 07:22.223
To Michael Dorsey, who makes you
remember what acting's all about!

07:22.933 --> 07:24.934
Being unemployed!

07:26.019 --> 07:27.228
To Michael...

07:27.438 --> 07:30.022
...who's been my friend for six years.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
Was it that long?

07:31.940 --> 07:34.443
And who is my coach.
And he's just great.

07:34.943 --> 07:38.157
He's a great coach, a great actor.
He's a great guy and...

07:38.532 --> 07:40.827
This is a really dumb speech.
Let's get drunk.

07:41.452 --> 07:42.827
Happy birthday!

08:06.436 --> 08:08.356
- How you doing? Michael.
- Patty.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.941
You an actress? Terrific face.
Nice blouse. Who'd you come with?

08:12.525 --> 08:15.947
I don't want a full house
at the Winter Garden Theatre.

08:16.447 --> 08:20.661
I want 90 people who just came out
of the worst rainstorm in history.

08:21.036 --> 08:24.749
These are people who are alive
on the planet...

08:25.540 --> 08:27.459
...until they dry off.

08:27.543 --> 08:31.130
I wish I had a theatre that
was only open when it rained.

08:34.551 --> 08:36.844
Strasberg said you create
your opportunities.

08:37.053 --> 08:38.429
- Uta said that.
- I don't care.

08:38.929 --> 08:43.726
The point is, Sandy and I are raising
$8,000 to do Jeff's play in Syracuse.

08:43.934 --> 08:46.854
We're going to do it.
You could do the same.

08:47.564 --> 08:49.649
Look at Emily!
Look who's here.

08:50.527 --> 08:52.236
You can do it in the Poconos.

08:52.527 --> 08:56.239
You're sitting around saying,
"I can't work." Create your own...

08:56.531 --> 08:57.741
Isn't she cute?

08:58.034 --> 09:00.328
He loves children.
He really does.

09:00.536 --> 09:03.247
You make it!
You find a way to raise it.

09:03.538 --> 09:07.044
I was looking at you.
Terrific face. Are you an actress?

09:07.544 --> 09:09.630
- Sometimes.
- You were in Dames At Sea!

09:10.046 --> 09:12.049
- You saw that?
- Good work. Really!

09:12.550 --> 09:14.551
You have a great singing voice.

09:15.052 --> 09:17.846
I felt there was an aura
between us when I saw it.

09:18.055 --> 09:19.931
I'm not kidding.
I don't know you, but I know you.

09:20.055 --> 09:23.561
I'll tell you about yourself.
You like to run barefoot on the beach.

09:24.062 --> 09:27.565
- Why are you so wired?
- It's my birthday. I'm out of work.

09:28.066 --> 09:29.443
That's it? Nothing more?

09:29.568 --> 09:33.654
Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one
to take your coat tonight. We'll talk.

09:34.029 --> 09:35.366
Fine. All right.

09:35.657 --> 09:36.742
Will you? Serious?

09:37.033 --> 09:38.159
Give me a hug.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.247
Thank you for liking me.

09:40.662 --> 09:42.957
I don't like it when people say...

09:43.666 --> 09:45.751
..."I really dug your message, man."

09:46.168 --> 09:49.548
Or, "I really dug your play, man.
I cried."

09:50.048 --> 09:51.257
You know?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.261
I like it when people come up to me...

09:54.551 --> 09:55.763
...the next day...

09:56.555 --> 09:58.349
...or a week later and they say...

09:58.640 --> 10:00.142
..."I saw your play.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.063
What happened?"

10:03.146 --> 10:06.858
I've got it under control. I'll feed
my cats and be back in an hour.

10:07.066 --> 10:10.154
I can't make it. My roommate
wants to work on the third act.

10:10.654 --> 10:13.364
- You can't make it?
- He wants to work.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.866
- Give me your phone number.
- I already did.

10:16.159 --> 10:18.869
- I thought you changed it.
- Since an hour ago?

10:19.663 --> 10:22.458
Good point.
Let me talk to him. I'll call you.

10:25.168 --> 10:27.171
- Didn't anybody hear me?
- Guess not.

10:27.671 --> 10:29.547
I've been trapped for half an hour.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.260
What kind of a party is this?

10:31.550 --> 10:33.970
God, you guys are having
a good time, huh?

10:34.053 --> 10:35.262
Sorry.

10:36.139 --> 10:39.433
I'll remember that if I ever
do a scene where I'm trapped.

10:40.643 --> 10:43.062
- It's nice, Michael.
- Thanks.

10:45.148 --> 10:46.112
Who is that?

10:46.148 --> 10:48.943
- Mallory. She's married to John.
- Oh, yeah.

10:54.158 --> 10:58.370
I did a thing about suicides
of the American Indian.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.749
And nobody cared. Nobody showed.

11:02.166 --> 11:06.171
And I think the American Indian
is as American...

11:06.671 --> 11:08.757
...as John and Ethel Barrymore...

11:09.174 --> 11:11.135
...and Donny and Marie Osmond.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.137
I think it's really sad...

11:13.762 --> 11:16.473
...but I think that, nowadays,
when people dream...

11:16.640 --> 11:20.061
...they don't even dream in their
own country anymore.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.064
And that's sick.

11:22.146 --> 11:24.649
I had a good time.
I just didn't know half the people.

11:25.149 --> 11:27.277
It was late, and I wanted it
to be a surprise.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.071
I invited 10 people.
They all invited 10 people.

11:30.155 --> 11:32.658
You met 40 new people.
They all liked you.

11:33.241 --> 11:34.847
I heard nice things about you.

11:34.884 --> 11:36.453
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Good night.

11:37.161 --> 11:38.539
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

11:38.748 --> 11:40.875
- One of the five people I knew.
- Great party.

11:41.251 --> 11:42.377
Thank you.

11:46.256 --> 11:48.842
Excuse me, Miss Right?
Miss Right?

11:57.141 --> 11:59.061
Good night.
It was a wonderful party.

11:59.645 --> 12:03.941
My date left with someone else.
I had fun. Do you have any Seconal?

12:04.150 --> 12:05.942
Come on, I'll take you home.

12:07.277 --> 12:09.448
I did have a good time.
I really did.

12:09.739 --> 12:12.159
You didn't.
Wait. Money for cab fare.

12:12.242 --> 12:14.743
That's okay. It's cheaper to
get mugged. Let's walk.

12:15.243 --> 12:17.455
The fares are really
insane now anyway.

12:17.746 --> 12:20.750
- Why didn't you have a good time?
- I did have a good time.

12:21.251 --> 12:22.962
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

12:23.254 --> 12:24.671
What?

12:25.255 --> 12:28.676
- What?
- Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

12:28.759 --> 12:30.760
I just cry like this, like a tic.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.972
Tell me what's wrong,
or I'll kill you.

12:34.265 --> 12:37.269
Nothing's wrong, Michael.
I'm really very up.

12:37.769 --> 12:40.980
You're worried about your audition.
Why?

12:41.273 --> 12:43.275
- Because I'm not going to get it.
- Why not?

12:43.776 --> 12:47.653
- Because I'm completely wrong for it.
- What kind of a part is it?

12:48.864 --> 12:50.282
A woman!

12:50.783 --> 12:52.953
You don't have a man,
so you act like one.

12:53.245 --> 12:55.664
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm proud of being a woman.

12:56.372 --> 12:58.583
Wait a minute.
This guy treats you like dirt...

12:58.874 --> 13:00.669
...because he's a big doctor, right?

13:00.753 --> 13:03.172
But don't take that.
Talk to him on his level.

13:03.881 --> 13:04.756
Show me.

13:05.256 --> 13:07.052
You're doing a Southern accent?

13:07.260 --> 13:10.054
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm very proud of being a woman!

13:10.763 --> 13:12.347
I can't do it as good as you.

13:12.764 --> 13:16.059
You can! Just turn the tables
on him. Come on, now.

13:16.769 --> 13:19.063
You're wrong.
I'm proud of being a woman.

13:19.271 --> 13:20.236
Where am I off?

13:20.273 --> 13:23.985
- I don't know what you're playing.
- I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.

13:24.777 --> 13:27.656
You told me to turn the tables.
I'm playing rage.

13:27.781 --> 13:28.572
This is rage?

13:30.284 --> 13:31.868
I have a problem with anger.

13:32.285 --> 13:35.165
You do. But there's 100 other
actresses reading...

13:35.373 --> 13:37.667
...who don't, who aren't
afraid of working.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.252
Who aren't afraid to stick
everything on the line and do it!

13:40.878 --> 13:42.880
- Don't get mad!
- Stop being a doormat!

13:43.381 --> 13:45.758
- I'm not a doormat!
- Act right now! Do it!

13:45.883 --> 13:47.886
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...

13:48.387 --> 13:49.227
Go on.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.472
- You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...
- Must I hit you with a stick?

13:52.849 --> 13:55.352
You're wrong.
I am very proud to be a woman.

13:55.852 --> 13:56.979
And I'm proud of this hospital.

13:57.354 --> 13:59.648
And before I see it destroyed
by your petty tyrannies...

13:59.856 --> 14:01.150
Have the anger. Don't show it to me.

14:01.775 --> 14:04.070
...I'll recommend you be
thrown out into the street.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.071
- Don't lose it.
- Good day.

14:06.364 --> 14:09.283
- Don't whine like you're second-rate.
- I said good day!

14:10.868 --> 14:11.750
Not bad.

14:11.786 --> 14:13.579
Did you feel how much I hated you?

14:13.871 --> 14:16.248
- You really felt it?
- That's why I'm going.

14:16.750 --> 14:20.253
How can I get it back tomorrow?
How can a total stranger enrage me?

14:20.879 --> 14:22.881
I'll pick you up at 10:00
and enrage you.

14:28.387 --> 14:31.682
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.

14:31.891 --> 14:34.060
- Bennett?
- Right here.

14:34.351 --> 14:35.480
Stanz?

14:40.859 --> 14:42.068
I'm supposed to look like this?

14:42.361 --> 14:44.155
- That is what you look like.
- It's not funny.

14:44.362 --> 14:45.656
Good.
Don't lose that.

14:45.865 --> 14:48.868
No sequins, Alfred.
She's attending her husband's funeral.

14:49.368 --> 14:52.372
Jacqui? As soon as Ron gets here, in.

14:52.872 --> 14:53.872
Lester.

14:53.956 --> 14:55.667
Lester. Sandy Lester?

14:55.876 --> 14:57.294
Yes, here.

14:59.379 --> 15:00.171
Stop it!

15:01.881 --> 15:04.092
Bye-bye. Good morning, ladies.

15:04.383 --> 15:06.971
Please bring your résumés
and follow me.

15:07.386 --> 15:08.180
Wish me luck.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.057
- Fuck you.
- Thank you.

15:10.391 --> 15:12.059
- Go.
- God bless you.

15:12.894 --> 15:17.065
Here you'll recognize your favorite
characters from Southwest General...

15:17.356 --> 15:21.068
...including John Van Horn,
who has played Dr. Medford Brewster...

15:21.485 --> 15:23.864
...since the first episode aired
20 years ago.

15:24.363 --> 15:28.993
Now we'll head into Studio B,
where the episodes are actually taped.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.375
Andrew Donovan,
report to Wardrobe, please.

15:34.875 --> 15:35.875
I didn't get it.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.878
- What?
- They wouldn't let me read.

15:38.463 --> 15:42.465
- They wouldn't let you read?
- They said I wasn't right physically.

15:42.966 --> 15:45.595
They want somebody tougher.
So I'm going home.

15:45.970 --> 15:46.764
I'll walk you.

15:46.888 --> 15:47.765
To San Diego?

15:48.473 --> 15:51.060
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going home!

15:51.476 --> 15:52.561
I hate it here!

15:52.978 --> 15:55.980
God! I'm 34!
I paid $24 for these glasses.

15:56.481 --> 15:58.775
All I do is buy things...
I want to be a waitress.

15:58.983 --> 16:02.072
I wasn't gonna resort to this,
but you're gonna read.

16:02.989 --> 16:04.330
Excuse me, is Terry Bishop here?

16:04.366 --> 16:08.077
No, Mr. Bishop is rehearsing
The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.

16:08.494 --> 16:09.287
He's what?

16:09.995 --> 16:12.873
He's rehearsing The Iceman Cometh
for Broadway.

16:12.998 --> 16:15.669
That was my part.
I was supposed to be up...

16:16.461 --> 16:19.590
I got to see somebody.
Don't do anything rash.

16:20.467 --> 16:21.467
Will he be back?

16:44.075 --> 16:45.957
- Is George Fields in?
- Yes, he is.

16:45.994 --> 16:48.789
Now, wait a minute.
You can't just go in there!

16:56.964 --> 16:59.674
Michael, he's tied up right now.
I swear!

17:01.593 --> 17:04.387
Hang on. Will you wait outside?
I'm talking to the Coast.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.472
This is a coast.
New York is a coast too.

17:06.973 --> 17:07.939
Oh, boy.

17:07.976 --> 17:09.603
Sy, are you...

17:09.976 --> 17:12.271
God... Look what you...
Margaret?

17:12.480 --> 17:14.397
Get him back.
I cut myself off.

17:14.483 --> 17:15.692
What is it, Michael?

17:16.567 --> 17:20.405
Terry Bishop's doing Iceman.
You promised to send me up for that.

17:20.570 --> 17:23.992
You told me I'd get a reading for that.
Aren't you my agent?

17:24.492 --> 17:26.869
- Stuart Pressman wants a name.
- Terry Bishop is a name?

17:26.994 --> 17:30.874
Michael Dorsey is a name,
when you want to send a steak back.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.377
Wait, wait, wait!
You always do this to me.

17:34.503 --> 17:37.089
It was a rotten thing to say.
Let me start again.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.593
Terry Bishop is on a soap.
Millions watch him every day.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.806
That qualifies him to ruin Iceman?
I can act circles around him.

17:45.097 --> 17:49.479
- I played that part in Minneapolis.
- lf he wants a name, that's his affair.

17:50.104 --> 17:52.773
People are in this business
to make money.

17:53.107 --> 17:55.484
- I'm in it to make money too.
- Really?

17:55.567 --> 17:58.988
The Harlem Theatre for the Blind?
The People's Workshop at Syracuse?

17:59.071 --> 18:01.573
Wait a minute.
I did nine plays up at Syracuse.

18:02.073 --> 18:05.495
I got great reviews from the critics.
Not that that's why I did it.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.499
God forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure.

18:09.082 --> 18:10.584
You think I'm a failure?

18:11.084 --> 18:13.504
I will not get sucked
into this conversation.

18:14.088 --> 18:14.880
I will not.

18:15.088 --> 18:18.884
I sent you my roommate's play to read.
It had a great part in it for me.

18:19.176 --> 18:22.388
Where do you come off sending me
a play for you to star in?

18:22.597 --> 18:25.682
I'm not your mother.
I don't find plays for you to star in.

18:26.099 --> 18:27.977
I field offers.
That's what I do.

18:28.102 --> 18:29.897
Who told you that?
The agent fairy?

18:30.606 --> 18:32.982
I could be terrific in that part.

18:33.108 --> 18:35.276
- Nobody's going to do that play.
- Why?

18:35.610 --> 18:38.781
It's a downer about a couple
that move back to Love Canal.

18:39.197 --> 18:39.990
But that actually happened.

18:40.074 --> 18:43.786
Nobody wants to watch people
living next to chemical waste!

18:44.203 --> 18:45.580
They can see that in Jersey.

18:46.205 --> 18:50.002
I don't want to argue about it.
I'll raise $8,000 and produce his play.

18:50.084 --> 18:52.086
Send me up for anything.
I don't care.

18:52.586 --> 18:55.674
I'll do dog commercials.
I'll do radio voice-overs.

18:56.174 --> 18:58.010
- I can't put you up for that.
- Why not?

18:58.094 --> 19:00.680
Because no one will hire you.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.473
I bust my ass to get a part right!

19:03.683 --> 19:05.976
And you bust everybody else's ass too!

19:06.685 --> 19:09.104
Who wants to argue about
whether Tolstoy can...

19:09.188 --> 19:12.108
...walk when he's dying
or walk when he's talking..?

19:12.608 --> 19:15.112
That was two years ago,
and that guy's an idiot!

19:15.696 --> 19:18.490
They can't all be idiots.
You argue with everybody!

19:18.698 --> 19:21.994
You've got one of the worst
reputations in this town.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.789
Nobody will hire you.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.877
Are you saying that nobody
in New York will work with me?

19:29.211 --> 19:33.213
Nobody in Hollywood will either.
I can't even get you a commercial.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.803
You played a tomato, and they went over
schedule because you wouldn't sit.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.560
Yes, it wasn't logical.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.308
You were a tomato! A tomato
doesn't have logic. It can't move!

19:43.683 --> 19:46.603
So if he can't move,
how's he going to sit down?

19:47.103 --> 19:50.106
I was a stand-up tomato.
A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!

19:50.691 --> 19:53.611
Nobody does vegetables like me!
I did vegetables off-Broadway!

19:53.694 --> 19:55.614
I did the best tomato,
the best cucumber!

19:56.197 --> 19:59.784
I did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass!

20:01.201 --> 20:02.913
I'm trying to stay calm here.

20:03.204 --> 20:05.582
You are a wonderful actor.

20:05.708 --> 20:06.501
Thank you.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.879
But you're too much trouble.

20:10.212 --> 20:11.798
Get some therapy.

20:12.714 --> 20:16.094
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise
$8,000 to do Jeff's play.

20:16.219 --> 20:19.514
Michael, you're not
gonna raise 25 cents.

20:20.181 --> 20:22.600
No one will hire you.

20:23.185 --> 20:24.310
Oh, yeah?

20:54.300 --> 20:55.217
Dorothy Michaels?

20:55.802 --> 20:57.512
- Yes.
- George Fields is your agent?

20:57.719 --> 20:59.390
- Yes.
- Okay, ladies.

20:59.681 --> 21:02.017
Please bring your pages
and follow me.

21:05.813 --> 21:08.815
I hate this line,
"You have every right to happiness."

21:09.315 --> 21:11.693
This is Dorothy Michaels.
Our director, Ron Carlysle.

21:11.819 --> 21:16.115
That's our producer, Rita Marshall.
George Fields is Dorothy's agent.

21:16.785 --> 21:17.785
That's impressive.

21:20.787 --> 21:24.416
I'm afraid you're not right for
this role. Thanks for coming by.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.919
Page 205, you want camera one or two?

21:27.212 --> 21:30.424
- Camera two, and tell Art.
- Why am I not right?

21:30.799 --> 21:33.217
I'm trying to make
a certain statement...

21:33.802 --> 21:36.804
...and I'm looking for
a specific physical type.

21:37.806 --> 21:42.102
Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.
I can play it any way you want.

21:42.811 --> 21:44.689
I'm sure you're a very good actress.

21:44.815 --> 21:47.608
It's just that you're not
threatening enough.

21:47.816 --> 21:48.900
Not threatening enough?

21:49.318 --> 21:52.404
Take your hands off me or
I'll knee you in the balls!

21:52.822 --> 21:55.201
- Is that enough of a threat?
- It's a start.

21:55.325 --> 21:59.204
I think I know what you want.
You want a caricature of a woman.

21:59.788 --> 22:02.998
To prove some point like
power makes a woman masculine...

22:03.291 --> 22:04.918
...or masculine women are ugly.

22:05.293 --> 22:08.590
Well, shame on any woman
that lets you do that.

22:08.798 --> 22:10.716
And that means you, Miss Marshall.

22:11.301 --> 22:14.303
Shame on you, you macho shithead.

22:15.304 --> 22:16.512
Jesus!

22:18.307 --> 22:21.896
What is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine?

22:23.896 --> 22:25.900
Not that that was my point.

22:28.318 --> 22:30.402
Miss Michaels, just a minute.

22:32.323 --> 22:34.701
Was that for real
or were you auditioning?

22:34.825 --> 22:37.619
Which answer will get me
a reading, Miss Marshall?

22:38.330 --> 22:39.705
Well, good for you.

22:39.830 --> 22:40.916
Come.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.920
- Miss Michaels.
- Yes. Oh, thank you.

22:48.424 --> 22:50.592
You really think she's worth testing?

22:50.925 --> 22:55.222
She told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast.

22:55.931 --> 22:56.807
She said that?

22:58.391 --> 22:59.395
I like her...

22:59.810 --> 23:00.894
...accent.

23:12.324 --> 23:15.494
- I gotta get these back in order.
- They won't know the difference.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.711
I'm a little nervous.

23:24.419 --> 23:26.297
Just think of them
as something friendly.

23:26.422 --> 23:28.298
Like a firing squad.

23:33.431 --> 23:36.600
Miss Michaels, we're going to
do a camera test now.

23:37.434 --> 23:41.229
Let me have a right profile, camera 1.
Camera 3, a left profile.

23:41.396 --> 23:42.231
What side?

23:42.898 --> 23:43.733
Left side.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.609
Which way for your left?

23:46.402 --> 23:48.613
- What?
- Is that my left or your left?

23:48.904 --> 23:51.532
Wait. What are you talking about?
My left.

23:52.407 --> 23:53.373
Your left.

23:53.410 --> 23:56.036
Miss Michaels, nobody's talking to you.

23:56.413 --> 23:58.331
I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted my profile.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.627
- Not so close on camera 3.
- Camera 3, back off.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.713
Make her look a little more attractive.
How far can you pull back?

24:05.921 --> 24:07.800
- How do you feel about Cleveland?
- Knock it off.

24:07.925 --> 24:09.635
That's good right there, Herbie.

24:10.428 --> 24:13.515
Dorothy, honey, we're going
to try one. Okay?

24:14.016 --> 24:16.934
Let me see exactly
what you showed us a while ago.

24:17.435 --> 24:18.437
Cue her, Jo.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.732
"I know the kind of woman
you are, Emily.

24:22.398 --> 24:26.819
You're getting older. You don't have
a man, so you want to act like one."

24:27.029 --> 24:30.699
Shut your mouth right now. When you
talk to me, talk professionally.

24:31.533 --> 24:35.037
You don't get personal.
That is inappropriate behavior.

24:35.414 --> 24:37.625
I'm proud of being a woman,
Dr. Brewster.

24:37.916 --> 24:40.334
I'm proud of this hospital,
and you should be too.

24:41.002 --> 24:45.715
And I must tell you, before I let it
be destroyed by your petty tyrannies...

24:46.508 --> 24:48.803
...by your callous inhumanities, sir...

24:49.011 --> 24:52.723
...I'm going to recommend
you be turned out into the street.

24:55.517 --> 24:56.727
Good day, Dr. Brewster.

24:59.022 --> 25:00.814
I said good day, sir.

25:05.529 --> 25:08.115
Thank you.
Hold it a minute.

25:09.032 --> 25:09.825
Tough cookie.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.534
I gave her that direction.

25:12.035 --> 25:13.328
Something more, though.

25:13.536 --> 25:18.417
I don't know. It's your decision,
but something about her bothers me.

25:19.044 --> 25:20.210
I like it.

25:21.002 --> 25:23.213
We'll send the contracts to George.

25:30.012 --> 25:34.516
Excuse me. Could you help me?
I'm looking for the Russian Tea Room.

25:35.521 --> 25:38.605
This is the Russian Tea Room.
You're in front of it.

25:39.023 --> 25:40.732
Oh, well, my stars! So it is.

25:41.024 --> 25:43.027
Well, this is very embarrassing.

25:43.527 --> 25:45.530
Yeah, well, this is it.

25:46.030 --> 25:47.406
Thanks very much.

25:54.038 --> 25:57.917
Good afternoon, Mr. Fields.
Nice to see you. Please sit down.

26:01.046 --> 26:03.633
- The waiter will be just a minute.
- George, how are you?

26:04.132 --> 26:06.219
Hey, Ronnie. How are you?

26:14.144 --> 26:15.645
- Hi.
- Wait a minute...

26:16.021 --> 26:18.941
I'm new in town, and I'm lonely.
Would you buy me lunch?

26:19.608 --> 26:22.026
You can't come...
Gregory, this woman...

26:22.110 --> 26:23.320
Don't. It's okay.

26:23.611 --> 26:27.116
George. George. George.
It's Michael Dorsey, okay?

26:27.533 --> 26:31.912
Your favorite client. How are you?
Last job you got me was a tomato.

26:32.538 --> 26:33.916
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Yeah.

26:34.124 --> 26:36.543
- Swear to God.
- Michael?

26:37.126 --> 26:39.337
Oh, God! I begged you to get therapy.

26:39.628 --> 26:44.051
- You also said no one would hire me.
- And this'll make a difference?

26:44.636 --> 26:45.927
I got a soap.

26:46.136 --> 26:49.347
I'm the new woman administrator on
Southwest General.

26:49.639 --> 26:52.643
Congratulate me! They thought
I almost looked too feminine.

26:53.143 --> 26:57.024
- Something from the bar?
- A double vodka right away, please.

26:57.148 --> 26:58.442
For the lady?

26:59.150 --> 27:01.528
How about a Dubonnet with a twist?

27:01.612 --> 27:03.528
- Thank you. Lovely blouse.
- Thank you.

27:04.115 --> 27:06.448
- Welcome.
- You won't get away with this.

27:06.616 --> 27:09.536
- I got away with it. Look around.
- I don't believe this.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.039
I mean, I just don't
believe anybody else will.

27:13.124 --> 27:15.125
- You want to bet?
- Don't sit...

27:16.126 --> 27:19.130
- You know Joel Spector.
- Hello, Joel. How are you?

27:20.633 --> 27:22.551
I talked to Stuart yesterday.

27:22.634 --> 27:26.638
He'll be one more week in London.
Then he definitely...

27:27.222 --> 27:29.104
- I missed you!
- Then he definitely...

27:29.140 --> 27:33.936
You're such a tickly-wickly. You
never were before. We go back years.

27:34.731 --> 27:36.940
- We haven't been introduced.
- Joel Spector.

27:37.233 --> 27:38.735
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Weintraub.

27:39.153 --> 27:42.446
- Sorry. This is Michael...
- Dorothy Michaels. Nice to meet you.

27:42.655 --> 27:45.450
May I say that you are
the best director...

27:46.117 --> 27:47.534
- Producer.
- Sorry. Producer...

27:47.618 --> 27:49.330
...on the Broadway scene today.

27:49.745 --> 27:51.623
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Michaels.

27:53.625 --> 27:55.836
- Hope to see you again.
- Let's have lunch.

27:56.128 --> 27:57.545
- Fine.
- Call you.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.923
He's handsome.
You should represent him.

28:00.132 --> 28:02.344
- You are psychotic!
- No, I'm employed.

28:02.635 --> 28:04.637
- I got the whole world...
- Don't!

28:05.138 --> 28:08.224
- I won't make fun of you.
- Don't get close to me!

28:08.641 --> 28:11.018
- Loan me $1000 till payday.
- For what?

28:11.142 --> 28:14.939
For what? I gotta have something
to wear besides this.

28:31.749 --> 28:34.753
I won't let you not buy it.
It's the best dress you've had on.

28:35.129 --> 28:36.920
I think it makes me look dumpy.

28:37.254 --> 28:40.926
Because you're wearing ankle straps.
With a few alterations...

28:42.218 --> 28:44.054
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

28:44.221 --> 28:46.223
Thank you, thank you.

28:46.726 --> 28:49.351
What are you doing?
I was here first!

29:00.238 --> 29:01.155
Thank you.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.742
Those women were like animals.
I saw this beautiful handbag.

29:05.243 --> 29:09.455
I was afraid to fight for it.
They're vicious. They kill their own.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.545
The woman that finally bought
this handbag, I know did time.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.754
Now I don't have a decent handbag.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.340
You know what this lingerie cost?
And the makeup?

29:18.756 --> 29:21.346
How does a woman keep herself
attractive and not starve?

29:21.761 --> 29:23.430
Can I have more cottage cheese?

29:23.765 --> 29:26.559
- You wore this today?
- I gotta set that before I go to bed.

29:26.726 --> 29:28.144
Easy, easy, easy.
Please!

29:28.227 --> 29:29.436
I'm dieting. Please.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.439
I gotta get up at 4:30,
do a close shave.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.943
I told the studio I do my own makeup
because I'm allergic.

29:36.234 --> 29:39.738
I appreciate your doing this,
but it's for the money, isn't it?

29:40.241 --> 29:43.033
It's not so you can wear
these little outfits?

29:43.243 --> 29:47.956
I'm not even gonna answer that.
It's a great acting challenge.

29:48.748 --> 29:50.460
You know what my problem is?

29:51.251 --> 29:52.045
Cramps.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.756
No, not cramps.

29:55.256 --> 29:56.047
Sandy.

29:57.341 --> 30:00.636
How can I tell her they cast a man
instead of her? She'll be suicidal.

30:00.761 --> 30:01.846
Don't tell her.

30:02.345 --> 30:04.140
Where will I say I got the money?

30:04.849 --> 30:08.563
What am I going to do? Tell her
somebody died and left it to me?

30:08.729 --> 30:10.856
- My God! When did she die?
- Last week.

30:11.356 --> 30:12.148
Of what?

30:12.357 --> 30:13.732
A disease.

30:13.858 --> 30:16.236
Gee, what a coincidence.

30:16.861 --> 30:20.741
I mean, your needing $8000 and
her leaving you exactly that much.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.910
- Isn't it?
- It's, well...

30:22.946 --> 30:24.454
- All right, kid.
- It's mine?

30:24.829 --> 30:26.664
- Learn your lines.
- I'm excited!

30:27.331 --> 30:28.749
This is the greatest part!

30:28.832 --> 30:32.462
I want to take you to dinner.
It's time we celebrated something.

30:32.754 --> 30:35.341
- To Return to the Love Canal.
- Hurry up.

30:36.341 --> 30:39.052
- I'll jump in the shower.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

30:52.359 --> 30:53.942
Why, yes.

31:26.354 --> 31:29.565
You know, we can stay here
if you want to, and...

31:29.941 --> 31:32.443
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God! I'm...

31:36.949 --> 31:38.740
Sandy, I want you.

31:39.451 --> 31:40.598
You want me?

31:40.634 --> 31:41.744
I want you.

31:42.872 --> 31:44.039
I want you.

31:47.833 --> 31:51.338
- Will I ever see you again?
- We've known each other six years.

31:51.963 --> 31:54.675
I know. But sex changes things.

31:55.342 --> 31:58.262
I've had relationships where I
know a guy, then have sex with him...

31:58.345 --> 32:01.473
...and then I bump into him and
he acts like I loaned him money.

32:01.973 --> 32:04.143
That's not me.
I'll call you tomorrow.

32:04.435 --> 32:08.648
I know there's pain in every
relationship. I just want my pain now.

32:09.441 --> 32:11.152
Otherwise, I'll wait by the phone...

32:11.442 --> 32:13.863
...and then I'll have pain
and wait by the phone.

32:13.946 --> 32:15.071
It's a waste of time.

32:15.362 --> 32:17.574
Let's make it definite.
Dinner tomorrow.

33:20.475 --> 33:21.267
Mom?

33:23.979 --> 33:27.148
What do you think?
Hurry. I'm late.

33:27.983 --> 33:28.944
Turn around.

33:31.446 --> 33:32.447
Smile.

33:33.447 --> 33:36.367
- Say something.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

33:37.075 --> 33:38.474
You look very nice. Nice.

33:38.510 --> 33:39.870
But the hair's not right.

33:40.454 --> 33:42.750
You got a Howard Johnson's thing going.

33:42.959 --> 33:46.170
Do something. I can't be late
my first day. Come on.

33:47.546 --> 33:50.258
- Easy, easy!
- It's not your head.

33:50.965 --> 33:52.175
- Okay?
- Let's see.

33:52.969 --> 33:54.344
Well, it works.

33:55.972 --> 33:57.057
But what?

33:57.557 --> 33:58.976
Don't play hard to get.

34:01.561 --> 34:02.979
Taxi! Taxi!

34:03.015 --> 34:03.979
Taxi!

34:14.076 --> 34:16.784
- Dorothy Michaels. Southwest General.
- Oh, yeah.

34:17.078 --> 34:18.954
TV 2.
Straight ahead, first right.

34:19.078 --> 34:20.164
Is that clock right?

34:20.456 --> 34:21.956
- Yes.
- I couldn't get a cab.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.378
Hi, Bobby. This is Miss Michaels.

34:26.088 --> 34:30.049
You'll be in Room 4. We'll need you
on set in about 15 minutes.

34:31.050 --> 34:32.514
- I'm sorry.
- That's ok...

34:32.551 --> 34:34.556
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's quite all right.

34:35.054 --> 34:38.058
- I'm April Paige.
- My, what a nice-looking table.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.478
- Really?
- Yes, it's very smooth.

34:40.561 --> 34:43.648
And that's a very good idea.
A socket for a plug.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.650
- Yeah, well, we got everything.
- Yes, I see.

34:47.067 --> 34:50.656
Just push all that out of the way.
Make yourself at home.

34:54.077 --> 34:54.869
Yes?

34:55.161 --> 34:58.372
One more thing, Miss Michaels.
I forgot to give you these.

34:58.579 --> 35:00.375
Oh, are these for today?

35:00.582 --> 35:03.585
They always throw stuff
at you in the last minute.

35:04.086 --> 35:05.462
- My goodness!
- What's wrong?

35:05.587 --> 35:08.883
- I have to kiss Dr. Brewster!
- He kisses all the women.

35:09.676 --> 35:11.761
We call him "The Tongue."

35:13.178 --> 35:17.058
Okay, quickly. Now, the tubes
have pulled out of Rick's nose.

35:17.684 --> 35:19.686
Julie, there's an alert
at your station.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.857
Rick, get on the floor.
That's why the tubes pulled out.

35:23.065 --> 35:26.275
When Julie starts stuffing
the tubes back up your nose...

35:26.568 --> 35:29.362
...you grab her hard.
- In his condition?

35:29.654 --> 35:32.284
Yes. He's been crazy
since he fell through the ice.

35:32.658 --> 35:34.786
You're delirious.
You think she's Anthea.

35:35.162 --> 35:37.289
- Mr. Carlysle, I...
- Jesus Christ!

35:37.664 --> 35:40.291
Could I have
a little more hammering here?!

35:43.085 --> 35:46.965
Now, when you grab her,
maybe you even say, "Anthea! Anthea!"

35:47.174 --> 35:49.594
Good. Is my violin somewhere
in the room?

35:50.177 --> 35:52.971
Your violin sunk.
It's at the bottom of the lake.

35:54.181 --> 35:56.059
The violin fell through the ice.

35:56.183 --> 35:58.562
He was playing during the thaw.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.272
You're Dorothy Michaels, aren't you?

36:01.690 --> 36:03.567
I'm John Van Horn.

36:04.192 --> 36:05.777
We're up next.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.495
When he grabs you,
you've got to be torn, to struggle.

36:14.661 --> 36:18.291
You know you've got to get those
tubes stuck back up his nose.

36:18.667 --> 36:21.086
But you also realize
you're in the arms of a man...

36:21.669 --> 36:25.466
...whose music was everything to Anthea.
It was her whole life.

36:25.675 --> 36:28.970
This is a man who stood by you
after Ted's breakdown.

36:29.178 --> 36:31.179
Get me a bagel and cream cheese.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.556
- Julie, you want anything?
- No. She's fine, thanks.

36:35.267 --> 36:39.271
So it's a struggle, but you're
struggling with yourself as well.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.067
- And I lose, right?
- Get down here a minute.

36:42.192 --> 36:45.862
Now, then, Rick, it says when she
comes down to her knees...

36:46.696 --> 36:48.572
...it inflames your desire.

36:48.697 --> 36:50.367
God knows, it inflames mine.

36:51.158 --> 36:52.285
Okay, Big John.

36:53.162 --> 36:54.579
Dorothy, come in here.

36:55.288 --> 36:58.459
This is Dorothy Michaels,
the new hospital administrator.

36:58.667 --> 36:59.794
Hello, Dorothy.

37:00.294 --> 37:03.590
Hi! We met the other day.
Julie Nichols, hospital slut.

37:04.173 --> 37:05.591
No! Now, Mr. Carlysle...

37:05.674 --> 37:08.970
I'm sorry, but we have so little time,
we can't even rehearse.

37:09.177 --> 37:13.391
I'm gonna show you your marks,
and then we'll go straight to tape.

37:14.184 --> 37:17.271
Big John, you'll enter from here,
you see them struggling...

37:17.772 --> 37:21.566
...you cross to here and cry loudly,
"Nurse Charles! Are you insane?"

37:22.276 --> 37:25.570
Yes, I see. Will it be
on the teleprompter? "Loudly?"

37:25.695 --> 37:27.490
And who do I say that to?

37:28.699 --> 37:30.576
Nurse Charles.

37:30.702 --> 37:32.370
I thought when Dr. Brewster...

37:32.786 --> 37:35.499
You will enter from here,
cross to this mark.

37:35.666 --> 37:37.501
I know my mark.
But I thought...

37:38.169 --> 37:41.588
The corridor scene will be played
right here. Right?

37:41.797 --> 37:44.591
See, I just wanted to ask
concerning the doctor...

37:44.801 --> 37:47.094
Places, please.
Stand by, tape is rolling.

37:49.263 --> 37:52.100
Five, four, three...

37:54.269 --> 37:55.269
Anthea!

37:56.270 --> 37:57.236
Oh, Anthea!

37:57.272 --> 37:58.898
Freeze up.
One twenty-five.

38:02.778 --> 38:04.989
Nurse Charles! Are you insane?

38:05.281 --> 38:07.866
I'm Emily Kimberly,
the new hospital administrator.

38:08.784 --> 38:12.287
Nurse Charles, what on earth
is going on here, dear?

38:12.787 --> 38:15.083
Help me get her to her feet,
Miss Kimberly.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.167
John's going.

38:19.296 --> 38:23.090
Nurse Charles, tend to your patient
and faint on your own time!

38:23.299 --> 38:24.677
- Yes, Miss...
- Kimberly.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.178
Dr. Brewster...

38:27.304 --> 38:28.389
...you and I must talk.

38:28.805 --> 38:32.185
- Rita, you want to keep rolling?
- It's okay. The girl saved it.

38:32.268 --> 38:35.270
- You haven't changed, Emily.
- But I have, Medford.

38:35.771 --> 38:39.983
You know, Emily, there's no reason
for us to be in opposite camps.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.779
We can rule Southwest General together.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.908
I admire people with power.

38:46.283 --> 38:48.995
Women with power, especially.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.790
God, she hit him on the head.
Rita, she hit him.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.168
- and not consider it a threat?

38:56.294 --> 38:58.880
I'm afraid that you have
underestimated me.

38:59.297 --> 39:02.092
If you want to win me over,
you'll deal with my mind...

39:02.384 --> 39:03.800
...and not my lips.

39:04.302 --> 39:05.679
- Cut it.
- And stop tape.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.598
- I was supposed to kiss her.
- It was just an instinct.

39:08.806 --> 39:11.685
Remember what you said about
being more threatening?

39:12.395 --> 39:14.479
It was a good instinct.
It would've been mine.

39:14.896 --> 39:17.190
Wait. I'll handle the instincts here.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.610
It happened to be a good
instinct, toots.

39:19.902 --> 39:23.905
But next time you want to change
something, discuss it with me first.

39:25.784 --> 39:27.578
Yes. I was wrong not to.

39:27.911 --> 39:28.912
Good girl.

39:29.412 --> 39:30.643
Big John, wonderful!

39:30.679 --> 39:31.872
All right, people.

39:32.373 --> 39:34.710
Item seven. In the corridor.

39:35.794 --> 39:37.213
Thanks for catching me.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.799
You saved my ass. Literally.

39:41.382 --> 39:42.677
Dorothy...

39:42.884 --> 39:46.806
...I just want to say I loved what you
did in our scene. Welcome aboard!

39:47.391 --> 39:49.476
Well, you know, you were good too...

39:59.401 --> 40:02.196
Can I have your autograph?
I've always watched the show.

40:02.405 --> 40:03.574
You're so great.

40:03.909 --> 40:05.701
Wonderful! Oh, thank you!

40:05.909 --> 40:08.079
Thank you. That was an
exhilarating first day.

40:08.412 --> 40:10.998
- Tell me about it next week.
- Good night.

40:11.415 --> 40:12.583
Julie, come on, baby.

40:13.376 --> 40:16.378
Can we drop you?
Maybe you'd like to join us for a drink.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.882
- No, thanks. I feel like walking.
- Okay, bye.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.398
She's a very attractive girl.

40:34.899 --> 40:37.276
And no dummy.
But for the life of me...

40:37.486 --> 40:40.780
...I cannot understand why she
hangs around with that director.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.907
He treats her like she's just...

40:43.408 --> 40:44.284
...nothing!

40:44.410 --> 40:45.577
I think you're right.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.206
I'm rewriting the necktie scene
without the necktie.

40:48.915 --> 40:51.291
He's condescending.
He calls me "sweetheart."

40:51.416 --> 40:53.209
He doesn't even know my name.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.004
He calls her "baby."

40:55.504 --> 40:59.591
He pushed me around. If not for
the dress, I'd have kicked his ass.

41:00.009 --> 41:01.887
How'd you communicate with him?

41:02.512 --> 41:04.889
He told me what he wanted.
I didn't say anything.

41:05.014 --> 41:09.518
I did it my way. He bawled me out.
I apologized. That was that.

41:11.981 --> 41:14.190
I think Dorothy's smarter than I am.

41:14.483 --> 41:17.612
I just wish I looked prettier.
I look in the mirror and...

41:17.987 --> 41:19.781
Maybe I can just get a softer...

41:20.488 --> 41:23.200
...hair or something,
because she deserves it.

41:24.995 --> 41:26.996
- Don't answer that!
- Why not?

41:27.496 --> 41:31.084
- It could be for Dorothy. Please.
- Why'd you give them this number?

41:31.502 --> 41:34.504
The show has to contact me
in case they change the schedule.

41:35.005 --> 41:36.299
I'll find out.

41:36.507 --> 41:39.719
They can't think Dorothy lives
with a man! It's wrong for her.

41:40.010 --> 41:42.096
It could be for me.
Answer as Dorothy.

41:42.513 --> 41:44.515
I can't!
What if it's Sandy?

41:45.015 --> 41:47.309
If it's Diane, how do I
explain there's a woman here?

41:47.518 --> 41:49.187
I'll get a service tomorrow.

41:51.522 --> 41:55.694
When you were playing Cyrano and you
stuck a saber in my armpit...

41:55.987 --> 41:57.321
...I didn't say anything.

41:57.487 --> 42:00.407
When you were hopping around,
ranting about your hump...

42:00.990 --> 42:03.285
...saying this was a bell tower,
I didn't say anything.

42:03.493 --> 42:06.706
But I don't see why I should
pretend I'm not home...

42:06.999 --> 42:09.292
...just because you're not
that kind of girl.

42:09.502 --> 42:10.793
That's weird.

42:12.504 --> 42:14.296
- Where are you going?
- To Diane's.

42:14.504 --> 42:18.302
That way if anybody wants to reach me,
they can talk to me.

42:19.009 --> 42:23.891
What do you think I'm doing this for?
For you, for the play, for Sandy...

42:26.019 --> 42:28.312
I told you to give me
the pain yesterday.

42:28.519 --> 42:31.107
Sandy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk long.

42:32.024 --> 42:33.609
I just don't have the energy.

42:34.027 --> 42:36.322
I didn't forget.
I just may have the flu.

42:36.488 --> 42:38.198
Do you have a fever?

42:38.489 --> 42:41.408
How much? Go right to bed
and take two aspirin...

42:41.493 --> 42:43.496
...bundle up, sweat, and drink liquids.

42:43.997 --> 42:47.625
Above all, take 1000 units of
vitamin C every hour with milk only.

43:12.610 --> 43:15.113
Did you give Melanie
an overdose on purpose?

43:15.613 --> 43:18.116
I don't know.
I don't write the shit, you know.

43:19.117 --> 43:22.327
Don't be so hard on Dr. Brewster.
He's insecure.

43:22.619 --> 43:24.915
I have to be tough.
He just wants my body.

43:25.623 --> 43:27.417
Dorothy, you're so bad.

43:27.626 --> 43:32.506
- You look just the way you look.
- Thank you. You're very attractive too.

43:33.132 --> 43:34.508
I want you to meet my dad, Les.

43:34.591 --> 43:37.427
- It's nice to meet you.
- I feel I know you already.

43:38.096 --> 43:40.305
I just love your daughter to pieces.

43:52.611 --> 43:56.033
I can't write any clearer
than I can write. It's in English.

43:56.615 --> 43:58.327
- What about those?
- For Sandy?

43:58.618 --> 44:01.995
For me, for Dorothy. Not exactly,
but that kind of idea.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.497
- A little overstated.
- Really? Wait a minute!

44:05.125 --> 44:06.209
Jesus!

44:06.625 --> 44:08.795
- That's her.
- Mr. Earl!

44:16.595 --> 44:18.430
You got it.
Thursday, what time?

44:20.223 --> 44:22.018
8:30.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.811
I will not forget.
Okay, bye-bye.

44:36.116 --> 44:39.036
"Things are better since you
came to Southwest General."

44:39.704 --> 44:41.496
- "We're so grateful to you."
- For?

44:41.622 --> 44:46.502
- "For your help and advice."
- "I think of you all as my daughters."

44:47.212 --> 44:50.424
"What kind of mother wouldn't
give her girls tits?"

44:50.714 --> 44:52.801
"Tips."
It's "tips."

44:53.635 --> 44:54.635
Tips.

44:54.718 --> 44:57.722
You'll find you picked
the wrong man to challenge.

44:58.222 --> 45:01.226
It was you who pro...
Look at me when I talk to you.

45:01.726 --> 45:03.569
I don't trust a man
who won't meet my eye.

45:03.605 --> 45:06.315
I don't trust it in a bank teller
or a salesman.

45:06.733 --> 45:10.027
And I certainly don't trust it
in a chief surgeon.

45:10.736 --> 45:12.320
You provoked this confrontation.

45:12.738 --> 45:14.907
You're an incredibly
insensitive woman.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.703
Stop thinking of me as a woman
and start thinking of me as a person.

45:19.203 --> 45:21.915
That's what Southwest General
is made of, people.

45:23.625 --> 45:26.126
And have Nurse Charles
see me immediately.

45:28.212 --> 45:30.341
- Push in for a close-up.
- Not too close!

45:30.715 --> 45:32.509
Okay, hold it there.

45:33.219 --> 45:35.011
- And cut it!
- Stop tape.

45:36.722 --> 45:39.808
Dorothy, it was wonderful
the way you held my face.

45:40.226 --> 45:42.019
You controlled me completely.

45:42.227 --> 45:44.606
Thank you, but you had
some great moments.

45:45.231 --> 45:46.607
Hold it. Good news, children.

45:46.732 --> 45:50.321
Our brilliant engineers have
again erased a reel of the show.

45:50.821 --> 45:54.324
So we have to retape
14, 15 and 16.

45:56.242 --> 45:58.412
It's either that
or do it live, tomorrow.

45:58.704 --> 46:00.415
I think we should tape it.

46:00.832 --> 46:04.544
That's a wrap. See you bright
and early, 6:30 tomorrow.

46:19.225 --> 46:21.813
- Good night, Dorothy.
- Good night, Ben.

46:25.317 --> 46:27.235
That's some day, huh?

46:27.820 --> 46:30.614
What? Oh, you mean about
doing it over again.

46:31.239 --> 46:33.616
Tell me, does that happen often?

46:33.741 --> 46:36.827
Every once in a while.
We actually had to do it live once.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.121
Live!

46:38.330 --> 46:42.043
You should have seen Van Horn's face.
He was so panicked...

46:42.335 --> 46:44.544
...we had to shoot him from the back.

46:45.839 --> 46:48.005
- Want some wine?
- No, thanks. I better go home.

46:48.717 --> 46:52.137
I have to wash my hair.
Thanks anyway.

46:52.345 --> 46:53.930
- Dorothy?
- Yes?

46:54.347 --> 46:57.809
Listen, I know this is exactly
what you want to hear now...

46:58.311 --> 47:00.936
...but we've got 26 pages,
and I was wondering...

47:01.229 --> 47:05.109
...if you could come over and
run some lines with me tonight.

47:05.818 --> 47:07.944
I could make you something to eat.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.532
Night, Fay.

47:09.823 --> 47:11.240
I'm a born defroster.

47:11.825 --> 47:13.410
You don't have a thing to wear?

47:13.742 --> 47:16.621
- She's seen me in all these.
- Not in the white thing.

47:16.830 --> 47:21.126
What, this? You cannot wear white
to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.

47:21.334 --> 47:24.545
- You couldn't wear pants?
- No. Pants? I can't.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.549
- What about this?
- No shoes for it.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.718
The lines make me look hippy...

47:29.843 --> 47:31.719
...and it cuts me across the bust.

47:33.432 --> 47:35.350
We're getting into a weird area.

47:35.934 --> 47:37.436
This is smart.
What about this?

47:37.811 --> 47:40.021
Looks like you should
ring a school bell.

47:40.938 --> 47:43.733
This may seem silly to you,
but this is our first date.

47:43.817 --> 47:45.527
I want to look pretty for her.

47:47.820 --> 47:49.824
Hi.
What a pretty outfit.

47:50.324 --> 47:51.741
- Glad you like it.
- Come on in.

47:51.826 --> 47:54.036
- Brought you something.
- You didn't have to.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.038
It wasn't nothing.

47:57.332 --> 47:59.125
Come in.
I'll put them in water.

47:59.333 --> 48:01.253
What a big apartment.

48:01.835 --> 48:04.423
- What a lovely, lovely room.
- Is it?

48:04.839 --> 48:07.551
- Yes, it's yummy.
- I had a decorator do it.

48:08.426 --> 48:10.346
Before, no money.
Now, no time.

48:10.429 --> 48:14.141
- Amy is asleep. Finally.
- Scared the daylights out of me.

48:14.851 --> 48:19.648
Miss Nichols, that child is never
going to learn anything if you keep...

48:19.938 --> 48:21.649
Thank you, Mrs. Crawley.

48:21.815 --> 48:24.318
- Dorothy, Mrs. Crawley.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

48:24.945 --> 48:26.446
Nice meeting you.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.240
- Scares the shit out of me.
- Scared me to death.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.118
Drop your coat here.

48:32.952 --> 48:34.747
- Who is it?
- Amy's nanny.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.122
And she hates me.

48:36.331 --> 48:37.332
Who's Amy?

48:37.416 --> 48:38.543
My daughter.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.754
She was 14 months old last week.

48:41.921 --> 48:43.631
I didn't know you had a baby.

48:44.424 --> 48:46.842
You got any kids, Dorothy?

48:47.927 --> 48:50.847
- Were you ever married?
- I haven't been that fortunate.

48:51.347 --> 48:55.144
I was engaged once, though,
to a brilliant young actor...

48:55.435 --> 48:58.940
...whose career was cut short by
the theatrical establishment.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.338
- They killed him?
- So to speak.

49:02.376 --> 49:05.237
Sutton gave up acting, and me as well.

49:05.946 --> 49:09.825
He's working now as a waiter
in a disreputable restaurant.

49:10.451 --> 49:11.828
I don't want to talk about it.

49:11.953 --> 49:13.246
Maybe you'd like some wine?

49:13.955 --> 49:17.249
No, I think I'd better keep sharp
when we work, you know?

49:18.419 --> 49:20.628
You mind if I ask you a question?

49:20.921 --> 49:24.342
Do you worry about using so much
heavy makeup on your skin?

49:24.926 --> 49:26.344
I don't worry.

49:26.426 --> 49:27.720
I have a little...

49:28.929 --> 49:31.139
...moustache problem I'm sensitive to.

49:31.432 --> 49:34.351
Probably just too many
male hormones or something.

49:36.938 --> 49:38.858
Some men find that attractive.

49:38.941 --> 49:42.860
I know, I know. I just don't like
the men that find it attractive.

49:46.947 --> 49:48.325
So you're divorced?

49:49.451 --> 49:50.744
I've never been married.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.124
Perhaps I'll have
one little drink.

50:03.550 --> 50:05.135
Tell me about Ron.

50:06.053 --> 50:08.555
- How much time have you got?
- Go on.

50:08.931 --> 50:10.932
Well, Ron...

50:11.433 --> 50:14.644
Ron is, hands down, the best
director of daytime drama.

50:15.061 --> 50:17.357
Did they tell you
not to call it a soap yet?

50:18.024 --> 50:21.527
If anybody calls it a soap opera,
Rita fines them a quarter.

50:21.944 --> 50:23.363
It's how she got her car.

50:23.530 --> 50:25.656
You're not telling me
about you and Ron.

50:26.449 --> 50:30.037
That's nighttime drama.
He's interesting there too.

50:30.538 --> 50:32.247
Oh, you mean he's...

50:33.958 --> 50:36.335
You mean you have a good relationship.

50:37.045 --> 50:40.965
What's a good relationship, Dotty?
Can I call you Dotty?

50:41.465 --> 50:44.927
- Oh, please do.
- Ron's smart and he's funny.

50:45.553 --> 50:46.930
We got things in common.

50:47.056 --> 50:49.933
You know a guy who wants a woman
who eats at four...

50:50.057 --> 50:52.143
...is unconscious by nine
and works at dawn?

50:53.060 --> 50:55.230
But how does he treat you?

50:56.064 --> 50:57.651
Oh, that!

50:58.566 --> 51:01.362
- You think I do this without a plan?
- What do you mean?

51:01.530 --> 51:06.241
There are a lot of men out there.
I'm selective. I look around carefully.

51:06.533 --> 51:09.329
When I find the one who can
give me the worst time...

51:10.037 --> 51:11.666
...that's when I make my move.

51:21.134 --> 51:23.552
My lines sound like subtitles
for a Czech movie.

51:24.053 --> 51:27.265
Try answering as if the question
took you by surprise.

51:27.557 --> 51:28.434
What do you mean?

51:28.642 --> 51:30.853
I'll ask a question.
You just answer it.

51:32.561 --> 51:33.562
Why do you drink so much?

51:34.563 --> 51:39.443
When you grow up as I did, an orphan
raised by a sister 16 years older...

51:40.070 --> 51:41.363
...you have few illusions.

51:41.530 --> 51:43.865
- There you go.
- It made a difference?

51:44.032 --> 51:44.868
You got it.

51:45.034 --> 51:46.952
Thanks, Dorothy.

51:49.038 --> 51:50.955
Why do you drink so much?

51:51.541 --> 51:53.167
Because it's not fattening...

51:53.669 --> 51:57.047
...and it's not good for me.
How many things can you say that about?

51:58.131 --> 52:00.049
You telling me to mind
my own business.

52:00.132 --> 52:02.552
I just don't think you
should worry about it.

52:04.054 --> 52:07.767
- It's nice of you, but...
- But I should mind my own business.

52:10.644 --> 52:12.772
It's all so complicated, isn't it?

52:13.646 --> 52:15.441
- What?
- All of it.

52:15.650 --> 52:18.945
Don't you find being a woman
in the '80s complicated?

52:19.571 --> 52:20.863
Extremely.

52:21.573 --> 52:24.368
- You know what I wish, just once?
- What?

52:25.660 --> 52:28.956
That a guy could be honest enough
to walk up to me and say...

52:29.039 --> 52:31.166
..."Hey, I'm confused about this too.

52:31.542 --> 52:35.045
I could lay a big line on you,
we could do lots of role-playing...

52:35.672 --> 52:39.258
...but the simple truth is,
I find you very interesting...

52:39.675 --> 52:43.138
...and I'd really like to make love
with you." Simple as that.

52:43.638 --> 52:46.057
- Wouldn't that be a relief?
- Heaven.

52:46.642 --> 52:47.767
Sheer heaven.

52:49.145 --> 52:53.273
Ron was supposed to come over
last night. I had dinner all ready.

52:53.649 --> 52:55.067
He never showed up.

52:55.149 --> 52:56.945
Oh, my Lord!
What time is it?

52:57.652 --> 52:58.736
It's 10:30.

52:59.155 --> 53:00.156
I gotta go.

53:00.656 --> 53:04.576
Listen, forgive me for rushing off.
It was a wonderful dinner.

53:22.138 --> 53:23.103
The dinner is burned.

53:23.139 --> 53:26.058
I'm sorry I'm late.
But I was taking a shower...

53:26.642 --> 53:28.269
...and the water turned off...

53:28.769 --> 53:30.940
...and I got soap in my eyes.

53:31.273 --> 53:34.942
I had to go to five stores to get
chocolate-chocolate chip.

53:35.150 --> 53:36.445
Michael, I saw her.

53:37.153 --> 53:38.446
What? You saw who?

53:39.156 --> 53:41.450
When you were late,
I went by your place.

53:41.659 --> 53:45.370
I waited outside and I saw that
fat woman go into your apartment.

53:45.747 --> 53:47.247
Fat woman?

53:47.748 --> 53:49.875
The one in the raincoat.

53:51.252 --> 53:53.880
Oh, that woman!
That's a friend of Jeff's.

53:54.172 --> 53:56.967
She came over to help him
with the play.

53:58.260 --> 54:00.554
They've known each other for years.

54:01.262 --> 54:02.144
You think she's fat?

54:02.180 --> 54:05.267
Well, it was dark but, yes,
I thought she was fat.

54:05.767 --> 54:08.145
When did Jeff start
collaborating on his play?

54:08.772 --> 54:10.648
She's an excellent typist.

54:11.275 --> 54:14.068
Look, I'm not having
an affair with that woman.

54:14.151 --> 54:16.154
It's impossible.

54:17.780 --> 54:19.657
I don't want to make trouble.

54:19.782 --> 54:22.368
I shouldn't have people over.
They never show up.

54:22.744 --> 54:25.665
I'm sorry. I feel guilty.
You feel guilty. I'm sorry.

54:26.247 --> 54:30.084
Don't do that. Don't apologize
because I'm three hours late.

54:30.252 --> 54:32.464
You should be furious.

54:32.754 --> 54:34.172
You've been great to me.

54:34.758 --> 54:38.762
You helped me with the audition
for that soap. It's that soap!

54:39.263 --> 54:41.556
That soap!

54:43.264 --> 54:45.352
Did you see that cow they hired?

54:45.768 --> 54:46.644
Cow?

54:47.271 --> 54:49.273
They must've gone a different way.

54:49.773 --> 54:50.982
She is awful.

54:53.861 --> 54:56.280
Well, I heard she was pretty good.

54:56.363 --> 54:57.280
Baloney!

54:58.866 --> 55:00.763
She's supposed to be tough, right?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.662
She's not tough.
She's a wimp!

55:03.871 --> 55:06.250
Maybe it's the lines.
She doesn't make them up.

55:06.791 --> 55:08.459
Well, I think she should.

55:08.877 --> 55:10.341
They couldn't be any worse.

55:10.377 --> 55:12.464
I can't move out, Miss Kimberly.

55:12.757 --> 55:14.550
I have no place to go.

55:15.259 --> 55:17.470
I don't know what to do.

55:20.848 --> 55:24.310
Don't tell me your husband beats you,
but you can't move out.

55:24.768 --> 55:27.230
- Why should you move?
- What is she saying?

55:27.271 --> 55:28.481
Three's up. Ready one.

55:28.856 --> 55:31.318
You know what I'd do
if somebody did this to me?

55:31.776 --> 55:35.781
I'd pick up the biggest thing
around and I'd just...

55:36.823 --> 55:38.658
...bash their brains
right through...

55:38.909 --> 55:42.454
...the top of their skull before
I'd let them beat me up again.

55:43.915 --> 55:47.002
Well, I can't afford therapy,
Miss Kimberly.

55:47.253 --> 55:49.378
Who said anything about therapy?

55:49.755 --> 55:51.088
- Cut it, Ron.
- Cut it!

55:51.421 --> 55:54.425
Wait a minute. Her line is
"Your husband..."

55:54.758 --> 55:55.759
Wait a second.

55:56.388 --> 55:57.763
May I say in my own defense...

55:57.929 --> 56:00.934
...to tell a woman
with two children, no money...

56:01.433 --> 56:04.102
...and a husband who beats
her up like this...

56:04.270 --> 56:07.774
...to move into a welfare center
to get therapy is a lot of...

56:08.357 --> 56:10.860
...horseshit!
I wouldn't do it, would you?

56:11.361 --> 56:13.364
- I can't act with this.
- Oh, shut up.

56:13.864 --> 56:14.657
Ron?

56:31.924 --> 56:34.718
I'm partially to blame, Miss Kimberly.

56:35.386 --> 56:38.098
I know I'm pretty, and I use it.

56:38.432 --> 56:41.894
I guess I shouldn't have gone
to Dr. Brewster's office so late.

56:42.393 --> 56:43.563
No, that's not true.

56:44.021 --> 56:47.817
Dr. Brewster has tried to seduce
several nurses on this ward...

56:48.401 --> 56:51.737
...claiming to be in the throes
of an uncontrollable impulse.

56:51.905 --> 56:53.405
Do you know what?

56:54.408 --> 56:59.078
I'm going to give every nurse
on this floor an electric cattle prod...

56:59.370 --> 57:02.665
...and instruct them to just zap
him in his "badubies."

57:03.457 --> 57:04.381
Cattle prod?

57:04.417 --> 57:07.420
Ruby. Hi, do you want to
open up the yellow pages...

57:07.921 --> 57:10.466
...under the section
of Farm Equipment...

58:21.582 --> 58:24.836
I am Dorothy. Nobody's writing her.
It's coming out of me.

58:25.127 --> 58:26.506
You're Michael acting Dorothy.

58:26.631 --> 58:29.843
It's the same thing.
I'm experiencing these feelings.

58:30.595 --> 58:35.431
Why can't you get me a special?
I feel I have something to say to women.

58:35.597 --> 58:39.645
- You have nothing to say to women.
- I have plenty to say to women.

58:40.145 --> 58:42.940
I've been an unemployed
actor for 20 years!

58:43.106 --> 58:46.109
I know what it's like to wait
for the phone to ring!

58:46.610 --> 58:50.240
Then when I finally get a job,
I have no control! I got zip!

58:50.615 --> 58:52.824
If I could impart that experience
to other women...

58:53.117 --> 58:56.037
There are no other women
like you. You're a man!

58:56.120 --> 58:59.416
Yes, I realize that, of course.
But I'm also an actress.

59:00.123 --> 59:03.630
- We shouldn't argue about this.
- I'm a potentially great actress.

59:04.130 --> 59:08.633
I could do Medea, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth.
Just like in Shakespeare's day.

59:09.217 --> 59:10.887
Get the writers at the agency...

59:11.137 --> 59:13.013
I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.

59:13.138 --> 59:14.932
We can do the
Eleanor Roosevelt story!

59:15.141 --> 59:17.143
The Eleanor Roosevelt story?

59:17.644 --> 59:19.437
What's the matter with that?

59:19.644 --> 59:22.232
Phil Weintraub's party is Saturday.
Let's just go.

59:22.648 --> 59:25.236
Have a good time.
Don't take yourself so seriously.

59:25.568 --> 59:28.239
- He never invited me to a party.
- I'm inviting you.

59:29.614 --> 59:31.742
He did a fabulous job on your eyes.

59:32.075 --> 59:34.244
I can't blink for a week. Really.

59:34.620 --> 59:36.831
- I don't like it here.
- Stand up straight.

59:45.132 --> 59:47.551
- What do you want?
- A double champagne.

59:49.636 --> 59:52.680
What is this?
Just serve yourself?

59:53.724 --> 59:55.142
Hi. What would you like?

59:55.726 --> 59:57.018
Give me two...

59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.023
- Two what?
- Of anything.

01:00:05.737 --> 01:00:07.823
- I'm sorry...
- A couple of champagnes.

01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:17.249
- Can I get you something?
- Vodka on the rocks with a twist.

01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:19.335
You don't remember me?

01:00:19.628 --> 01:00:22.630
When I came in, I thought
you looked familiar.

01:00:23.213 --> 01:00:25.800
- What's your name again?
- Suzanne.

01:00:26.216 --> 01:00:27.634
Call Pamela Green, my agent.

01:00:27.718 --> 01:00:30.429
Paramount's interested.
I'll know after the first.

01:00:31.223 --> 01:00:32.515
I'll read it after the first.

01:00:32.725 --> 01:00:35.434
Actually, I'm not that crazy
about the script.

01:00:35.728 --> 01:00:39.523
I'm having a rewrite done.
Maybe we could have dinner.

01:00:40.231 --> 01:00:42.151
Call Pamela.
She handles me for dinner.

01:00:42.234 --> 01:00:43.819
Do you have a light?

01:00:44.736 --> 01:00:46.155
- How've you been?
- Great.

01:00:46.239 --> 01:00:48.116
- Good.
- You look wonderful.

01:00:50.243 --> 01:00:52.120
Silly me, I already had dinner.

01:00:52.746 --> 01:00:54.955
I didn't know there'd be so much food.

01:00:55.248 --> 01:00:56.249
It's for my dog.

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:57.750
He likes fruit.

01:00:59.753 --> 01:01:01.547
Mike Dorsey.

01:01:02.756 --> 01:01:03.925
Great view, huh?

01:01:04.715 --> 01:01:07.552
Only Phil could afford all those lights.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.723
You know...

01:01:10.724 --> 01:01:13.644
...I could lay a big line on you...

01:01:13.727 --> 01:01:17.146
...and we could do a lot of
role-playing, but the simple truth...

01:01:17.731 --> 01:01:20.650
...is that I find you
very interesting.

01:01:20.734 --> 01:01:22.527
And I'd like to make love to you.

01:01:23.238 --> 01:01:25.030
You know?
It's as sim...

01:01:28.242 --> 01:01:29.827
As simple as that.

01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:43.550
I understand who you really are.

01:01:43.842 --> 01:01:47.346
And I'll no longer submit to your
petty insults and humiliations.

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:50.141
It's not necessary now that
Emily Kimberly's here.

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:53.226
Now that someone who sees
the truth is your equal.

01:01:53.351 --> 01:01:56.939
Listen, doctor, I've filed charges
against you with the AMA.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.857
You'll be notified tomorrow.

01:01:59.734 --> 01:02:01.527
- And cut it.
- Cut.

01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:02.945
It's a good one.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.948
Perfect.

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:08.536
- That was great.
- Thanks, John.

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:11.162
- Lovely job. First-rate.
- You were wonderful.

01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:12.622
Thanks to my coach.

01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:14.542
No, you did it yourself.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.543
- Was it okay?
- I loved the middle...

01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:18.964
So much for the
mutual-admiration society.

01:02:19.338 --> 01:02:22.342
Let's move on to item 17.
Jo, clear this set.

01:02:22.841 --> 01:02:25.927
I'll need Alan, Tom and John.

01:02:26.345 --> 01:02:27.765
Tootsie, take 10.

01:02:27.847 --> 01:02:29.140
Ron?

01:02:29.348 --> 01:02:30.349
My name is Dorothy.

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:33.644
It's not Tootsie or Toots
or Sweetie or Honey or Doll.

01:02:33.853 --> 01:02:36.565
- Oh, Christ.
- No, just Dorothy.

01:02:36.857 --> 01:02:39.860
Alan's always Alan, Tom's always Tom
and John's always John.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.448
I have a name too. It's Dorothy,
capital D-O-R-O-T-H-Y.

01:02:44.865 --> 01:02:45.742
Dorothy.

01:02:47.826 --> 01:02:49.246
Excuse me, doctor.

01:03:03.844 --> 01:03:04.930
Did somebody die?

01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:08.057
- Violinist.
- I didn't know he was that sick.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:10.559
He wasn't.
He asked for a raise.

01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:16.358
I'm sorry about what
happened out there.

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:20.361
- I was upset.
- What're you doing for the holidays?

01:03:20.861 --> 01:03:22.031
Why?

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:27.160
Well, the baby and I are gonna
go up to my dad's farm upstate.

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:31.249
It's not exactly the fast lane,
but it's kind of fun.

01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:33.543
Maybe you'd like to come along?

01:03:35.962 --> 01:03:39.632
You know, since my dad met you,
he's your biggest fan.

01:03:40.967 --> 01:03:42.344
Is Ron coming too?

01:03:43.971 --> 01:03:45.764
Would that make a difference?

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:48.266
Actually...

01:03:48.432 --> 01:03:51.060
...I think he has to stay
in town and work.

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:55.733
If it matters...

01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:00.237
...I've always hated women who treat
other women as stand-ins for men.

01:04:00.948 --> 01:04:02.531
It's not that, really.

01:04:03.951 --> 01:04:05.243
I'd just like you to come.

01:04:05.952 --> 01:04:09.957
I just don't want to get up too soon
or I'll have another relapse.

01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:14.252
Isn't there some way we could rehearse
in the same room together?

01:04:14.462 --> 01:04:17.674
We will. Right after the weekend.
I'll call you Monday.

01:04:17.966 --> 01:04:19.132
Thanks. Bye-bye.

01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:22.762
You know where my pink nightgown is?
With the flow...

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:24.055
- Listen to me.
- What?

01:04:24.473 --> 01:04:25.640
Stop packing.

01:04:25.973 --> 01:04:26.767
Don't do this.

01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:28.768
- Why?
- You should not do this.

01:04:29.435 --> 01:04:32.772
In two weeks, if I ever see Julie again,
it'll be as Michael...

01:04:32.939 --> 01:04:35.567
...and she'll probably
throw a drink in my face.

01:04:35.943 --> 01:04:38.946
- How can you keep lying to Sandy?
- It's for her own good.

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:43.075
I never told Sandy I wouldn't
see other women. Come on.

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:46.662
If I told her, it would hurt her
and I don't want to do that.

01:04:47.037 --> 01:04:49.874
Especially since Julie and I
are just girlfriends.

01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:52.252
I'm just afraid you'll
burn in hell for this.

01:04:52.961 --> 01:04:55.754
I don't believe in hell.
I believe in unemployment.

01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:30.167
- Wait! Let me get those.
- Oh, well, thank you.

01:05:31.545 --> 01:05:33.963
- Strong little thing, aren't you?
- Well, no.

01:05:36.548 --> 01:05:39.178
Come on, Dorothy.
I'll show you the house.

01:05:39.552 --> 01:05:43.140
- Careful coming up here.
- It really is old, isn't it?

01:05:44.976 --> 01:05:46.061
Here we are.

01:05:49.063 --> 01:05:50.940
I'll set up the crib in a second.

01:05:51.065 --> 01:05:52.566
Unpack your bags and we'll...

01:05:53.067 --> 01:05:54.776
Wait. Are we sharing?

01:05:54.943 --> 01:05:57.572
The upstairs is shut off.
And I know you girls.

01:05:58.073 --> 01:06:02.161
No matter what, you'll sneak back
together and spend the night giggling.

01:06:03.078 --> 01:06:05.372
He still thinks I'm 12.

01:06:06.081 --> 01:06:07.248
Which side do you want?

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.253
I think the one closest
to the bathroom.

01:06:11.044 --> 01:06:12.464
I won't take up much room.

01:06:23.058 --> 01:06:25.267
Take it between your thumb
and forefinger.

01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:29.064
Let every finger roll down
individually. That's it, yes.

01:06:29.647 --> 01:06:31.149
My goodness.

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:33.444
You'll be all right.

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:22.060
Special up here, isn't it?

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:24.187
I'm glad you came.

01:08:27.273 --> 01:08:28.567
Can I tell you something?

01:08:28.692 --> 01:08:29.486
Sweetheart?

01:08:31.153 --> 01:08:32.488
Ron is on the phone.

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.863
Hi. I'm sorry.

01:08:35.157 --> 01:08:37.158
- What, Dorothy?
- Nothing.

01:08:38.662 --> 01:08:40.662
- I think I'll put her down.
- Good.

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.875
Gets a little chilly out here.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:47.252
- No, I was just...
- I brought this sweater for you.

01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:49.464
Thank you.
Very nice of you, Les.

01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:50.673
Thank you.

01:08:58.765 --> 01:09:02.562
I wonder if we're going to get
any stars out of the sky tonight?

01:09:02.687 --> 01:09:04.064
I've got my stars.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:06.567
You and Julie.

01:09:36.264 --> 01:09:38.765
- It's beautiful.
- I should've transposed it.

01:09:39.268 --> 01:09:41.185
It's wonderful for a lady
to play piano.

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:42.895
Quit. Mama insisted.

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:45.983
- Who wants another drink?
- You better take it easy.

01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:47.694
- Remember Injun Joe.
- What's that?

01:09:47.778 --> 01:09:49.194
Don't you tell that story.

01:09:49.778 --> 01:09:52.365
- This bar Daddy hangs out in...
- I don't.

01:09:52.781 --> 01:09:55.159
He and Injun Joe threw back
a few too many.

01:09:55.284 --> 01:09:56.077
Hard liquor.

01:09:56.285 --> 01:09:57.871
They thought they saw this elk.

01:09:58.288 --> 01:09:59.998
They stalked it for a couple hours.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.584
They cornered it up
against Charlie's barn.

01:10:02.793 --> 01:10:05.796
About the time they were ready
to blast it, it mooed.

01:10:06.296 --> 01:10:07.799
It was a cow?

01:10:08.798 --> 01:10:10.468
Enough laughing at your old man.

01:10:10.802 --> 01:10:12.095
You know this one?

01:10:15.765 --> 01:10:16.600
Wait a minute.

01:10:45.297 --> 01:10:47.883
- Bravo!
- That was Julie's mother's name.

01:10:48.299 --> 01:10:50.301
Mary Juliet Cooper.

01:10:52.388 --> 01:10:53.764
Well, I'm going to bed.

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:57.268
Do you wanna hit the hay,
as they say on the farm?

01:10:57.768 --> 01:11:01.689
I think I'll... You and...
Both of you go to bed.

01:11:01.898 --> 01:11:03.566
- I'll stay up.
- I'll stay with you.

01:11:05.277 --> 01:11:06.487
Well, I'm going.

01:11:06.902 --> 01:11:08.697
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

01:11:08.905 --> 01:11:09.991
Good night, Dad.

01:11:10.282 --> 01:11:11.868
Sleep well.

01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:14.369
Be good.

01:11:17.372 --> 01:11:19.292
- Nice girl, isn't she?
- Very sweet.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.293
I'm kind of glad Ron didn't come up.

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:23.879
You know I am too, actually.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.508
Really?

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.677
- I'm sorry. Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

01:11:28.886 --> 01:11:32.389
I thought you'd be more like
one of them "liberators."

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:35.894
You know, I'm not really
like the woman on the show.

01:11:36.394 --> 01:11:38.979
I mean, it's just a part.
I'm not that militant.

01:11:39.397 --> 01:11:41.481
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all for equality.

01:11:41.899 --> 01:11:45.486
Women ought to be entitled to
everything and all, et cetera.

01:11:45.904 --> 01:11:46.988
Except...

01:11:47.488 --> 01:11:50.784
...sometimes I think
what they really want is to be men.

01:11:50.908 --> 01:11:54.288
Like men are all equal
in the first place. We're not.

01:11:54.996 --> 01:11:56.707
Can I get you another drink?

01:11:56.874 --> 01:11:58.291
I must keep my wits tonight.

01:11:58.374 --> 01:11:59.794
Tonight?

01:12:00.003 --> 01:12:01.169
Well, always.

01:12:01.378 --> 01:12:02.587
I remember years ago...

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.008
...there wasn't talk about
what a woman was, what a man was.

01:12:06.385 --> 01:12:08.177
You just were what you were.

01:12:08.886 --> 01:12:12.181
Now they have all this stuff about
being like the other sex...

01:12:12.891 --> 01:12:16.978
...so you can all be the same.
Well, I'm sorry, but we're just not.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.271
Not on a farm, anyway.

01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:22.610
Bulls are bulls,
and roosters don't try to lay eggs.

01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:24.277
Never.

01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:30.410
My wife and I, we were
married a lot of years.

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:32.078
People got it all wrong.

01:12:32.494 --> 01:12:34.790
They say your health
is the most important thing.

01:12:34.998 --> 01:12:38.001
But I can lift this house off the
ground. What good is it?

01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:39.710
Being with someone.

01:12:40.002 --> 01:12:41.296
Sharing.

01:12:42.005 --> 01:12:44.384
That's what it's all about.

01:12:46.509 --> 01:12:48.305
- Julie says you're not married.
- No.

01:12:49.012 --> 01:12:50.013
Like another drink?

01:12:50.389 --> 01:12:51.682
- No.
- You sure?

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:56.186
Yes. Well, you know what?
I think it is about that time.

01:12:56.979 --> 01:13:00.984
- Thanks for staying up and talking.
- Don't you mention it.

01:13:04.488 --> 01:13:05.780
You have beautiful eyes.

01:13:05.988 --> 01:13:07.491
Oh, well, thank you.

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:10.284
Good night, Les.

01:13:57.795 --> 01:14:00.214
Daddy's a little out of
touch, isn't he?

01:14:00.297 --> 01:14:02.091
No. Very sweet, very sweet.

01:14:03.801 --> 01:14:06.387
He sees things pretty simply.

01:14:07.805 --> 01:14:09.809
You're either happy or unhappy.

01:14:09.892 --> 01:14:11.684
Married or not married.

01:14:13.312 --> 01:14:15.313
There's nothing in between.

01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:28.494
I tried to get him to take out
other women after Mama died but...

01:14:28.911 --> 01:14:32.581
You know, she must have been
a very special person.

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:37.422
I guess so.
I don't remember her very well.

01:14:38.297 --> 01:14:42.592
I remember her helping me
pick out this wallpaper.

01:14:44.886 --> 01:14:48.515
I'd chosen one with great big,
purple flowers on it.

01:14:48.891 --> 01:14:50.684
And she said to me...

01:14:50.894 --> 01:14:53.604
..."Just remember that once
you choose it...

01:14:54.397 --> 01:14:58.610
...it's gonna cover the walls
of your room for a long, long time."

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:04.825
So I tried to imagine what those big,
purple flowers would look like...

01:15:05.325 --> 01:15:07.619
...on all the walls of my room...

01:15:08.411 --> 01:15:10.707
...every night when I was
falling asleep...

01:15:10.915 --> 01:15:13.418
...and every morning
when I was getting dressed.

01:15:14.919 --> 01:15:19.591
So I said to her,
"Which one would you choose, Mom?"

01:15:21.426 --> 01:15:26.221
And she said, "The one with
the daisies and the little rosebuds...

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:31.188
...because daisies
are such homey flowers...

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:37.108
...and rosebuds are so cheerful
and always waiting to bloom."

01:15:38.903 --> 01:15:39.987
That's lovely.

01:15:41.907 --> 01:15:45.994
I made a million plans
looking at this wallpaper.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:53.710
I was always waiting
for these rosebuds to open.

01:16:13.898 --> 01:16:15.693
That's nice.

01:16:17.903 --> 01:16:21.615
My mother used to do that too,
sometimes.

01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:30.624
- Good night, Julie.
- Good night, Dottie.

01:16:46.517 --> 01:16:48.393
Cathy Campbell,
please call your office.

01:16:48.519 --> 01:16:50.604
It says "cool."

01:16:51.522 --> 01:16:54.401
Don't you think I should be angry?
Doesn't it play better?

01:16:54.525 --> 01:16:56.110
Yes. Why don't you try that?

01:16:57.528 --> 01:17:00.532
This just came to
our dressing room for you.

01:17:01.032 --> 01:17:03.703
- I think it's from Julie's father.
- Oh, my!

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:07.999
Now don't you dare eat any.
You don't want to ruin your cute figure.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.917
What a thoughtless present
to give a woman.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:11.793
Chocolates!

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:15.130
Dorothy Michaels,
Rita Marshall's office.

01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:17.632
You're a complicated lady.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:21.429
On the one hand,
you're a real pain in the ass.

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:25.224
I've got one of the most
expensive directors in soaps...

01:17:25.517 --> 01:17:27.311
I owe myself a quarter.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.316
And you've got him
defensive and hostile.

01:17:30.523 --> 01:17:31.731
I don't mean to.

01:17:32.024 --> 01:17:34.736
However, we're getting
2000 letters a week...

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:37.906
...and we've picked up
three share points.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.826
And it's largely due to you.

01:17:41.034 --> 01:17:44.205
You are the first woman character
who is her own person.

01:17:44.622 --> 01:17:47.834
Who asserts her own personality
without robbing someone of theirs.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.002
You're a breakthrough lady for us.

01:17:50.502 --> 01:17:54.216
We're picking up your option for
another year. Congratulations.

01:17:56.008 --> 01:17:59.219
Come on, Mike. What do you mean,
get you out of it?

01:17:59.637 --> 01:18:01.932
There's no way out.
It's their option.

01:18:02.139 --> 01:18:03.808
What? Who gave them that?

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.019
You signed the standard contract.

01:18:06.601 --> 01:18:10.315
But I didn't know I'd be working
for the rest of my life as a woman!

01:18:10.524 --> 01:18:12.108
You gotta make it work.

01:18:12.608 --> 01:18:15.404
They'll pay. They'll go from
650 to 850 an episode.

01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:18.825
You get me out of this,
or I'll go in and tell them.

01:18:19.116 --> 01:18:20.034
Tell them what?

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:22.536
That you put a network on the spot?

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:25.332
You're making a fool out of women?
They'll kill you!

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:29.627
My secretary wants to be like
Dorothy Michaels. I want to fire her.

01:18:30.127 --> 01:18:34.424
We're talking major fraud here.
Major fraud! You can't tell them.

01:18:35.135 --> 01:18:38.430
What about me? You think anybody
will believe I wasn't in on this?

01:18:38.638 --> 01:18:42.518
It's not just ruining yourself.
This is ruining me too.

01:18:43.017 --> 01:18:45.603
You can't do it.
You gotta make it work.

01:18:46.603 --> 01:18:49.523
- Can you take that many Valium?
- We'll see.

01:18:49.608 --> 01:18:51.943
Maybe your contract has
a morals clause.

01:18:52.612 --> 01:18:56.615
If Dorothy did something filthy or
disgusting, they'd let you go.

01:18:57.615 --> 01:19:02.538
But you've already done everything
filthy and disgusting on your show.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:11.922
Dorothy, it's Julie.

01:19:12.132 --> 01:19:16.428
There's sort of an emergency.
Well, it's not really an emergency...

01:19:17.137 --> 01:19:19.516
...but if you get a chance,
would you call me?

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.311
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- No, but I'm going to.

01:19:23.643 --> 01:19:27.231
I've been fooling myself about Ron
for too long now.

01:19:28.106 --> 01:19:31.527
I guess I really wanted you here
for moral support.

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:34.822
Although I did fire Mrs. Crawley today.
I really did.

01:19:35.615 --> 01:19:38.534
- Want a drink?
- I'm not the one breaking up with Ron.

01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:40.120
I'd buy a ticket to that.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:44.207
You have influenced me though.
I've seen Ron through your eyes.

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:47.045
Julie, I don't want
that responsibility.

01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:48.919
Why shouldn't you influence me?

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.840
You wouldn't compromise your
feelings like I have...

01:19:52.216 --> 01:19:53.717
...or live this kind of lie.

01:19:54.216 --> 01:19:55.599
Well, no, I wouldn't.
But...

01:19:55.635 --> 01:19:58.013
Of course not. And you're right.
It's just...

01:19:58.638 --> 01:20:01.934
I deserve something better.
I don't have to settle for this.

01:20:02.227 --> 01:20:06.523
But I've always been too lazy
or too scared or too something.

01:20:07.232 --> 01:20:09.109
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:20:09.234 --> 01:20:11.320
What the hell?
I'll live, won't I?

01:20:11.736 --> 01:20:14.948
Maybe not happily, but honestly.

01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:16.617
Sounds like something you'd say.

01:20:17.243 --> 01:20:22.039
You mustn't idealize me. Honesty,
in many ways, is a relative term.

01:20:22.247 --> 01:20:23.625
My father's coming.

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.419
If he calls, don't say
anything about this.

01:20:26.712 --> 01:20:29.130
He's coming tonight.
He'll want to see you.

01:20:29.213 --> 01:20:30.550
Me?

01:20:31.216 --> 01:20:32.217
Oh, God!

01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:33.927
It's Ron.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.722
Oh, Dorothy, God bless you.

01:20:37.223 --> 01:20:38.515
Wish me luck now.

01:20:38.724 --> 01:20:40.016
Always.

01:20:40.226 --> 01:20:43.731
I feel that little moustache.
You should put some makeup on it.

01:20:49.735 --> 01:20:51.238
How're you doing?

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.705
What's going on?

01:20:54.742 --> 01:20:56.451
Dorothy's gonna sit with Amy.

01:20:56.743 --> 01:20:58.830
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:21:00.748 --> 01:21:02.332
Hi, honey.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:06.420
You don't mind if I call you honey
when we're not working?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.138
Nice dress.

01:21:15.722 --> 01:21:17.015
Thank you.

01:21:18.225 --> 01:21:20.226
You don't like me, do you?

01:21:20.727 --> 01:21:22.146
I can respect that...

01:21:22.854 --> 01:21:26.650
...but there's not many women
I can't make like me.

01:21:26.734 --> 01:21:28.527
Why don't you like me?

01:21:29.237 --> 01:21:31.240
I don't like
the way you treat Julie.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:32.532
Oh?

01:21:32.825 --> 01:21:37.037
I don't like the way you patronize her,
deceive her and lie to her.

01:21:37.829 --> 01:21:38.623
What do you mean?

01:21:38.747 --> 01:21:39.957
You want me to go on?

01:21:40.748 --> 01:21:42.751
No, I know what you mean.

01:21:44.336 --> 01:21:49.134
Look, I never promised Julie I'd be
exclusive and not see other women.

01:21:49.843 --> 01:21:52.428
But I know she doesn't want
me to see them...

01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:55.056
...so I lie to her
to keep from hurting her.

01:21:55.724 --> 01:21:57.724
That's very convenient.

01:21:58.225 --> 01:22:01.438
No, wait a minute.
Look at it from my side.

01:22:01.855 --> 01:22:04.857
See, if a woman
wants me to seduce her...

01:22:05.735 --> 01:22:06.736
...I usually do.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.159
But then she pretends I promised her
something. Then I pretend I did.

01:22:12.325 --> 01:22:14.326
In the end, I'm the one
that's exploited.

01:22:14.827 --> 01:22:16.454
Bullshit, Ron!

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:18.456
You know what?

01:22:18.831 --> 01:22:21.543
I understand you a lot better
than you think I do.

01:22:21.835 --> 01:22:22.919
Really?

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:25.337
I'm ready.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.844
- Julie's ready.
- She sure is.

01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:33.932
Dorothy, she never wakes up.

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:37.142
But if she does,
there's applesauce in the fridge.

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:39.645
Give her a couple spoonfuls.

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:42.440
I'm sure she...
Are you sure you'll be okay?

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:46.027
Don't be silly. How much trouble
can a baby be? Go on.

01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:49.657
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.

01:22:51.323 --> 01:22:54.245
Oh, please don't cry.
Please don't cry.

01:22:55.829 --> 01:22:57.040
Oh, I love you.

01:22:57.332 --> 01:22:59.124
Look how much fun we're having.

01:23:02.961 --> 01:23:04.693
It's all right. It's all right.

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:06.423
It's okay.
It's Uncle Dorothy.

01:23:06.841 --> 01:23:09.843
Please don't cry.
Please don't cry. Please.

01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:13.724
Oh, come on.
Oh, here's funny clown.

01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:15.727
Funny clown's talking to...
Look.

01:23:16.352 --> 01:23:18.436
Come on, Amy.
Hello, Amy.

01:23:18.853 --> 01:23:21.566
Amy...
Give me a break, will you?

01:23:21.856 --> 01:23:25.153
Here, come on.
Will you eat some more now?

01:23:25.444 --> 01:23:28.656
You told me to open up this one.
Now this is apri...

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:35.454
Gotcha! Gotcha!

01:23:35.829 --> 01:23:37.540
You want a little more apricot?

01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:40.754
Don't do that anymore.
Don't do that to Aunt Dorothy.

01:23:40.837 --> 01:23:42.630
You'll go to sleep after this.

01:23:42.964 --> 01:23:45.257
Just try this one,
and then I'll put you...

01:23:47.426 --> 01:23:50.637
I don't like you.
It's not funny.

01:23:51.348 --> 01:23:53.641
Amy, look at this.

01:23:54.434 --> 01:23:55.816
She'll have to paint the kitchen.

01:23:55.852 --> 01:23:59.438
Here, look at yourself.
You see what a bad girl looks like?

01:24:23.965 --> 01:24:25.343
Dorothy?

01:24:27.468 --> 01:24:29.054
I'll be right there.

01:24:33.433 --> 01:24:34.644
How's Amy? Any trouble?

01:24:34.935 --> 01:24:37.146
Oh, not at all.
She was an angel.

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.149
Are you all right?

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:40.858
Fine.

01:24:53.039 --> 01:24:54.664
What's the matter?

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.559
Tell the truth now.
Are you sure you're all right?

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560
No.

01:25:14.437 --> 01:25:15.437
Why?

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.566
Who am I going to have dinner with?

01:25:19.566 --> 01:25:23.070
Oh, God! I hate myself
for being like this.

01:25:28.034 --> 01:25:29.744
- You know something funny?
- What?

01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:33.165
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

01:25:33.957 --> 01:25:37.545
But since I met you, I'm so grateful
to have you as a friend.

01:25:38.044 --> 01:25:39.672
And yet, at the same time...

01:25:40.548 --> 01:25:43.467
...I've never felt lonelier
in my whole life.

01:25:45.969 --> 01:25:50.349
It's as though I want something
that I just can't have.

01:25:50.558 --> 01:25:51.976
You know what I mean?

01:25:59.568 --> 01:26:00.654
Do you?

01:26:08.578 --> 01:26:09.578
- Dorothy?
- Julie!

01:26:10.037 --> 01:26:11.748
- My God!
- Let me explain.

01:26:12.039 --> 01:26:13.165
Don't say anything.

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.377
- There's a reason.
- I understand.

01:26:15.542 --> 01:26:18.380
That's not the reason.
I'm not who you think I am.

01:26:19.045 --> 01:26:21.175
- Just wait a minute.
- Nobody is.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:22.800
- It's me.
- No, it's me.

01:26:22.837 --> 01:26:24.054
- No, it's me.
- No, it's me.

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.347
I'm not well-adjusted enough.

01:26:26.555 --> 01:26:29.850
I'm sure I've got the same impulses.
Obviously, I did.

01:26:30.057 --> 01:26:32.978
Don't jump to conclusions about
that impulse.

01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:36.274
If you could just see me
out of these clothes...

01:26:36.565 --> 01:26:37.651
What? What?

01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:40.154
That's my father!
You've got to tell him.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.406
- Tell him.
- Tell him what?

01:26:42.443 --> 01:26:44.156
That I...
That's a corncob.

01:26:46.575 --> 01:26:47.660
Hi, Dad.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:49.043
Fine.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.457
I'm here with Dorothy.

01:26:52.668 --> 01:26:54.877
I can't tonight, Daddy.
But wait.

01:26:56.546 --> 01:26:59.257
You've got to see him.
Just don't lead him on.

01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:02.678
- Please don't make me do this.
- You gotta let him down gently.

01:27:03.177 --> 01:27:05.348
- I can't.
- You owe me that.

01:27:14.064 --> 01:27:17.151
Hi, Les.
I'm fine. How are you?

01:27:18.152 --> 01:27:20.155
Tonight, sure.
Tonight?

01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:25.577
- What'll you have?
- Just water.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.078
- Water and bourbon.
- Make that a straight scotch.

01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:30.249
Scotch and bourbon.

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:32.752
I'd like to...

01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:34.545
- Let's dance.
- What?

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:37.464
- It's my favorite dance.
- Oh, really, I don't dance.

01:27:38.172 --> 01:27:39.175
- You'll love it.
- What?

01:27:39.675 --> 01:27:43.054
- Follow me. Follow me.
- Please, I don't...

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:48.268
You know what? I'd...
Really, I'd rather not.

01:27:51.146 --> 01:27:52.773
- Just relax.
- You're very good.

01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:56.486
- My wife and I took a course.
- I could tell at once.

01:27:57.652 --> 01:28:00.156
- Emily, we love you.
- You're fabulous!

01:28:00.656 --> 01:28:01.949
- Just wonderful.
- Wonderful.

01:28:02.158 --> 01:28:04.785
- You're even prettier in person.
- Thank you.

01:28:08.665 --> 01:28:11.460
I'm sorry. I forgot that
you're on your feet all day.

01:28:11.668 --> 01:28:14.588
- Come on, sit down.
- Yes, I think we should stop.

01:28:16.173 --> 01:28:17.883
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28:18.257 --> 01:28:20.386
I was happy you could
come out tonight.

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.265
I know you usually
got a lot of lines to learn.

01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:27.268
- There's something I'd better say.
- I want to say something too.

01:28:27.686 --> 01:28:30.481
Wouldn't it be funny
if we both said the same thing?

01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:32.565
It'd be hilarious.
But I doubt it.

01:28:32.773 --> 01:28:37.571
Well, mine's pretty simple.
I'm not too good with words anyway.

01:28:38.654 --> 01:28:40.991
I only took two pictures in my life...

01:28:41.158 --> 01:28:43.952
...my high-school graduation
and my wedding.

01:28:44.662 --> 01:28:46.580
My wife stood next to me in both.

01:28:46.663 --> 01:28:50.167
I never thought I'd want anybody
to fill her place.

01:28:50.752 --> 01:28:52.168
That changed last weekend.

01:28:52.205 --> 01:28:52.962
- Lester.
- Lesley.

01:28:53.253 --> 01:28:54.757
- Lesley...
- Don't interrupt me.

01:28:55.257 --> 01:28:57.466
I gotta do this in one go
or I won't do it.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.679
I know this is kind of quick,
but that's how I am.

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:04.058
Never did believe in
not getting down to it.

01:29:04.767 --> 01:29:06.183
Don't say anything now...

01:29:06.685 --> 01:29:09.480
I know it's fast.
But take time to think about it.

01:29:09.771 --> 01:29:12.774
If you say no, at least I'll feel
you took me seriously.

01:29:13.275 --> 01:29:15.362
Would you mind?
I just need to be alone.

01:29:15.778 --> 01:29:18.658
I'd like to start thinking it over
as soon as possible.

01:29:24.287 --> 01:29:25.455
Dorothy?

01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:29.168
This is a nightmare.

01:29:29.792 --> 01:29:31.879
Don't be angry.
I had to talk to you.

01:29:32.255 --> 01:29:34.464
- How'd you know where I live?
- I followed you.

01:29:34.757 --> 01:29:38.886
- What? Followed me home?
- I didn't have the courage to phone you.

01:29:39.262 --> 01:29:43.182
- Could I come up for a drink?
- No, you can't! I have a headache.

01:29:43.265 --> 01:29:46.979
Please! I'll only take
a tiny moment of your time.

01:29:47.771 --> 01:29:51.859
I'll see you on the set tomorrow
and we'll talk about it.

01:29:53.276 --> 01:29:55.196
Go home.
Have you been drinking?

01:30:24.269 --> 01:30:27.772
Shh! Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind?

01:30:28.397 --> 01:30:30.483
Come on up!
I'm on the third floor!

01:30:30.859 --> 01:30:33.486
Hurry before someone
calls the cops!

01:30:33.779 --> 01:30:35.195
Jesus!

01:30:38.783 --> 01:30:40.787
Come in, but you can
just stay a minute.

01:30:41.287 --> 01:30:45.082
Can I have a drink?
Anything alcoholic will do.

01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:49.671
- Just one drink and I'll go.
- Oh, all right, but I...

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.173
Nice mirror.

01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:01.267
Here.

01:31:02.392 --> 01:31:04.769
What is it that couldn't wait?

01:31:05.896 --> 01:31:09.275
I'm just an untalented
old has-been.

01:31:09.901 --> 01:31:11.241
Were you ever famous?

01:31:11.277 --> 01:31:14.572
- No.
- Then how can you be a has-been?

01:31:14.864 --> 01:31:18.201
I love the way you never let me
get away with anything.

01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:22.998
- Dorothy...
- Yes?

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.292
- I want you.
- Pardon?

01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:29.963
- I've never wanted a woman this much!
- Please! Perhaps another time.

01:31:30.381 --> 01:31:31.883
Turn me away, it'll kill me!

01:31:32.382 --> 01:31:35.177
- I don't want emotional involvement.
- I'll take sex.

01:31:35.386 --> 01:31:37.306
- I don't want to hurt you.
- I don't mind.

01:31:37.389 --> 01:31:38.474
Oh, shit!

01:31:45.981 --> 01:31:49.192
John Van Horn, Jeff Slater.

01:31:50.403 --> 01:31:52.697
Jeff Slater, John Van Horn.

01:31:53.489 --> 01:31:54.282
How do you do?

01:31:54.406 --> 01:31:55.366
How do you do?

01:31:56.866 --> 01:32:00.078
- I'll be going.
- I think it's best.

01:32:04.877 --> 01:32:07.795
- Gee, I hope I haven't...
- No, I hope I haven't...

01:32:08.881 --> 01:32:11.801
I want you to know, for the record...

01:32:12.385 --> 01:32:15.095
...that nothing happened here tonight.

01:32:18.892 --> 01:32:20.768
Thank you, John.

01:32:23.895 --> 01:32:25.690
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.903
I didn't understand.
I'm really sorry.

01:32:30.987 --> 01:32:32.407
Please don't talk about this.

01:32:32.991 --> 01:32:33.990
My lips are sealed.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.792
You slut!

01:32:44.002 --> 01:32:47.005
Look, don't start in with me.
Don't do that.

01:32:47.505 --> 01:32:49.799
Rape is not a laughing matter.

01:32:51.008 --> 01:32:52.177
That guy wanted me.

01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:55.598
You cannot believe
the night I have had tonight!

01:32:55.973 --> 01:32:58.183
- I think I can imagine.
- No, you can't.

01:32:58.475 --> 01:33:00.103
I saw his eyes.
I was in trouble.

01:33:00.477 --> 01:33:03.605
If you don't come in,
I'm in the Daily News the next day.

01:33:03.897 --> 01:33:05.398
How did you ever let him in?

01:33:05.482 --> 01:33:08.193
What do you mean?
He was singing.

01:33:08.902 --> 01:33:11.196
- Is he that good a singer?
- What do you..?

01:33:11.405 --> 01:33:12.407
That's him!

01:33:12.491 --> 01:33:14.992
Say I'm in the bedroom crying.
Don't let him in!

01:33:15.494 --> 01:33:16.411
Michael.

01:33:16.995 --> 01:33:17.959
It's Sandy.

01:33:17.996 --> 01:33:19.706
Sandy?
It's Sandy?

01:33:19.998 --> 01:33:22.083
I can't let her see me like this.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.878
I hear you in there.

01:33:25.003 --> 01:33:27.798
Open the door. It's me, Sandy.
Open the door!

01:33:28.507 --> 01:33:29.883
- Sandy, is that you?
- Yes!

01:33:30.008 --> 01:33:33.013
What time is it?
I fell asleep, I guess.

01:33:33.513 --> 01:33:35.974
I was having a nightmare
and you were in it.

01:33:36.475 --> 01:33:37.601
Mike's in the shower.

01:33:37.975 --> 01:33:40.688
I'm in the shower!
I got soap in my eyes!

01:33:41.104 --> 01:33:44.400
I'm not dressed.
I was asleep. I was dreaming.

01:33:44.483 --> 01:33:46.695
You were in my dream.
You had big teeth.

01:33:47.486 --> 01:33:48.485
I had big what?

01:33:48.611 --> 01:33:51.199
- I gotta get something on.
- Are you having a party?

01:33:52.492 --> 01:33:54.412
I'm in the shower!
Turn on the water!

01:33:54.494 --> 01:33:59.205
It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes
and there's no water coming out!

01:33:59.498 --> 01:34:01.501
I can't come out
with soap in my eyes!

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:02.877
Open the door!

01:34:05.004 --> 01:34:08.093
I can hear you in there, you guys.
Open the door!

01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:12.804
- Open this door.
- The door was open.

01:34:13.096 --> 01:34:14.891
You must think I'm really stupid.

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.808
No one would say it to your face.

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:20.981
I've been out there for 10 minutes.
It sounded like a party in here.

01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:24.110
Well, Mike was in the shower.
You know.

01:34:24.484 --> 01:34:27.279
- Hi, I was taking a shower.
- He was in the shower.

01:34:27.613 --> 01:34:29.197
- Good shower?
- Good shower.

01:34:29.489 --> 01:34:31.701
Why haven't you returned
my phone calls?

01:34:31.993 --> 01:34:34.120
I'll go do some writing.
Excuse me.

01:34:35.079 --> 01:34:37.580
Wait, I'll be back.
I got a present for you.

01:34:38.082 --> 01:34:38.963
Pigs!

01:34:38.999 --> 01:34:42.586
I'm glad you came over.
I've been meaning to give this to you.

01:34:43.087 --> 01:34:46.507
- I suppose this means nothing's wrong?
- Nothing is. Is it?

01:34:47.091 --> 01:34:50.011
I've called you all week
and you haven't called back.

01:34:50.095 --> 01:34:52.014
- You treat me like I'm a jerk.
- What?

01:34:52.598 --> 01:34:55.183
- I called and you didn't call back!
- No, it's...

01:34:55.601 --> 01:34:59.106
My new answering machine is no good.
I'll answer my own calls.

01:34:59.605 --> 01:35:04.402
- I went to six stores for your favorite.
- Chocolate-covered cherries?

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.612
That's sweet.
Oh, and a card.

01:35:07.112 --> 01:35:09.616
Oh, yeah. No, no!
Don't, don't read it!

01:35:10.115 --> 01:35:11.994
I was very angry when I wrote that!

01:35:12.119 --> 01:35:14.788
"Thank you for the lovely night
in front of the fire.

01:35:15.122 --> 01:35:16.707
Missing you, Les."

01:35:19.585 --> 01:35:21.920
This isn't for me.
It's another girl's candy.

01:35:22.588 --> 01:35:25.007
I wouldn't give you
another girl's candy.

01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:26.717
- Then, whose is it?
- Mine.

01:35:28.093 --> 01:35:29.805
A guy named Les sends you candy?

01:35:30.097 --> 01:35:33.807
Yes. He's a friend of mine.
He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.

01:35:34.099 --> 01:35:37.604
Why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire?

01:35:39.106 --> 01:35:40.398
My mind's a blank.

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:45.321
Are you gay?

01:35:47.114 --> 01:35:48.615
In what sense?

01:35:48.698 --> 01:35:51.993
Just be honest with me.
For once in your life tell the truth!

01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:55.916
Because these stories
are very demeaning to me.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:58.501
No matter how bad the truth is...

01:35:59.085 --> 01:36:01.921
...it doesn't tear you apart inside
like dishonesty.

01:36:02.589 --> 01:36:06.009
At least it leaves you with
some self-respect and some dignity.

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.011
You're right.

01:36:10.723 --> 01:36:13.392
Okay. Okay.

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.313
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

01:36:18.188 --> 01:36:20.525
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Sandy...

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:23.612
I'm in love with another woman.

01:36:25.698 --> 01:36:26.989
What are you saying?!

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:29.200
- Sandy, please. Don't...
- You liar!

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.994
We never said "I love you."

01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:33.206
- We went to bed one time.
- I don't care.

01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:37.210
You're a dear friend. But let's not
pretend it was something else!

01:36:37.711 --> 01:36:39.091
We're gonna lose everything!

01:36:39.128 --> 01:36:42.213
I don't care about "I love you!"
I read The Second Sex...

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:46.510
...and The Cinderella Complex!
I'm responsible for my own orgasms!

01:36:46.594 --> 01:36:48.512
I just don't like to be lied to!

01:36:49.097 --> 01:36:51.392
You asked me
to be straight with you.

01:36:51.601 --> 01:36:53.519
I didn't say
how I'd feel about it.

01:36:53.727 --> 01:36:56.729
- What can I do?
- There's nothing you can do for me.

01:36:57.231 --> 01:36:59.024
I just have to feel like this...

01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:01.820
...and you have to know
you made me feel this way!

01:37:02.194 --> 01:37:03.822
- Aren't we still friends?
- No!

01:37:04.198 --> 01:37:07.201
I don't take this shit from friends,
only from lovers.

01:37:07.701 --> 01:37:10.119
- Wait, what about the play?
- What about it?

01:37:10.202 --> 01:37:12.414
I should tell you to shove your play.

01:37:12.705 --> 01:37:15.709
But I won't, because
I never allow personal despair...

01:37:16.293 --> 01:37:18.212
...to ruin my
professional commitments.

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:20.505
I am a professional actress!

01:37:22.216 --> 01:37:25.720
So, are these real
chocolate-covered cherries?

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.306
I think so.

01:37:29.723 --> 01:37:31.894
- See you at rehearsal.
- Oh, Sandy...

01:37:32.227 --> 01:37:33.896
Don't call me.

01:37:35.522 --> 01:37:37.524
It's 2 a.m.
Can't this wait?

01:37:37.733 --> 01:37:40.318
I don't care.
Get me off this show in 10 days.

01:37:40.819 --> 01:37:43.613
- It's impossible.
- Then I'm getting a new agent.

01:37:44.197 --> 01:37:46.201
You hurt my feelings.
What happened?

01:37:46.326 --> 01:37:49.329
I told her about Julie.
She thinks I'm gay.

01:37:49.704 --> 01:37:52.207
- Julie thinks your gay?
- No, my friend Sandy.

01:37:52.707 --> 01:37:53.917
Well, sleep with her.

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:57.503
- I did and she still thinks I'm gay.
- Oh, that's not so good.

01:37:57.795 --> 01:38:00.924
I gotta get back to my life.
You got lots of lawyers...

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.802
...there must be a way to get
me out of this show.

01:38:04.218 --> 01:38:07.597
- We've been through this.
- Why can't Dorothy have an accident?

01:38:07.806 --> 01:38:10.435
We can use our imaginations.
This isn't too tough.

01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:14.313
Kill somebody and bring back the stiff,
but she'd better look like you.

01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:18.233
- They don't miss a trick.
- These are nice, good people.

01:38:18.818 --> 01:38:22.532
Since when do you care so much
about what other people feel?

01:38:22.822 --> 01:38:26.410
You should have seen Julie's face
when she thought I was a lesbian.

01:38:27.328 --> 01:38:29.038
Lesbian?
You just said "gay."

01:38:29.204 --> 01:38:31.622
Sandy thinks I'm gay.
Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.

01:38:31.707 --> 01:38:34.002
- I thought Dorothy was straight.
- She is.

01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:37.630
Les, the sweetest man in the world,
asked me to marry him.

01:38:38.339 --> 01:38:40.133
A guy named Les
wants to marry you?

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.134
Yeah.
No, wants to marry Dorothy.

01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:44.511
- He knows she's a lesbian?
- She's not!

01:38:44.803 --> 01:38:46.932
- I know that, but does he?
- Know what?

01:38:47.307 --> 01:38:49.309
That...
Well, I don't know.

01:38:49.811 --> 01:38:53.231
You know he gave me a ring?
He gave me a diamond ring.

01:38:53.314 --> 01:38:54.816
What did you say?

01:38:55.316 --> 01:38:56.733
"I got to think it over."

01:38:56.817 --> 01:39:00.237
I went in the ladies' room
and almost pissed in the sink.

01:39:01.405 --> 01:39:03.408
Thirteen's up.
Ready 14.

01:39:03.445 --> 01:39:05.409
Widen E.
Pull three to 130.

01:39:06.412 --> 01:39:08.204
- Cut it.
- Stop tape.

01:39:08.913 --> 01:39:11.416
We're gonna take
a short break, people.

01:39:11.833 --> 01:39:15.504
Hold it, hold it!
Slight change of plans, children.

01:39:15.837 --> 01:39:19.132
Our future ex-tape editor spilled
a bottle of celery tonic...

01:39:19.841 --> 01:39:22.428
...on the second reel
of the show airing today.

01:39:22.805 --> 01:39:25.223
So we have to redo
Emily's party scene, live.

01:39:25.306 --> 01:39:27.141
- Live?
- Quick, like bunnies.

01:39:27.309 --> 01:39:29.309
You have 26 minutes.
Get into wardrobe.

01:39:29.811 --> 01:39:32.230
- But Rita...
- You've only got a few lines.

01:39:32.313 --> 01:39:35.026
Well, I don't see
why we can't use the tape.

01:39:35.316 --> 01:39:37.735
Just because it's a little sticky.

01:39:44.828 --> 01:39:48.832
Explain to them that
the hours have to be flexible.

01:39:49.331 --> 01:39:53.544
No...
And I would...

01:39:57.926 --> 01:40:00.720
Can I call you back?
Thank you.

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:08.227
My God, Dorothy! I just...
Really, I can't.

01:40:08.436 --> 01:40:09.811
It's for Amy.

01:40:10.436 --> 01:40:12.731
Oh, thanks.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.444
That's nice.

01:40:14.944 --> 01:40:17.821
- I don't know how to say this...
- I wish you wouldn't.

01:40:18.947 --> 01:40:23.243
I understand that you weren't able
to tell my dad last night.

01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:28.333
So it'd be better for all of us
if I tried to explain it to him.

01:40:28.916 --> 01:40:31.835
Look, I wouldn't be honest
if I didn't tell you...

01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:36.049
...how much you've meant to me
these past couple weeks.

01:40:36.424 --> 01:40:41.346
You taught me how to stand up
for myself because you always do.

01:40:42.432 --> 01:40:45.934
You taught me to stop hiding
and just be myself...

01:40:46.435 --> 01:40:48.520
...because you're always yourself.

01:40:49.939 --> 01:40:51.148
I'm grateful to you.

01:40:54.026 --> 01:40:55.027
But...

01:40:56.529 --> 01:40:58.447
Well, I just...

01:40:59.031 --> 01:41:02.119
I just can't see you anymore,
you know?

01:41:05.414 --> 01:41:10.337
I just feel it would be leading you on.
It wouldn't be fair to you.

01:41:12.421 --> 01:41:14.923
I really love you, Dorothy.

01:41:15.423 --> 01:41:17.219
But I can't...

01:41:17.926 --> 01:41:19.722
I can't love you.

01:41:19.929 --> 01:41:22.015
Places, everybody.
Immediately!

01:41:22.933 --> 01:41:25.435
Fifteen seconds to commercial.

01:41:26.936 --> 01:41:28.729
I don't care how you get there.

01:41:29.022 --> 01:41:31.648
This is the most important night
in Emily's life.

01:41:31.941 --> 01:41:36.322
We're all going to be there
to honor her, including you.

01:41:42.619 --> 01:41:44.747
Stand by.
Quiet, please, on the floor.

01:41:45.331 --> 01:41:46.122
Stand by.

01:41:46.247 --> 01:41:49.125
Twenty-two and 23
come down to 18.

01:41:49.754 --> 01:41:51.046
Hold it.
That's good.

01:41:51.255 --> 01:41:54.133
Five, four, three...

01:41:59.221 --> 01:42:03.852
Let's raise our glasses to our
guest of honor, Ms. Emily Kimberly.

01:42:06.729 --> 01:42:10.734
We're looking forward to having
you grace us with your presence...

01:42:11.235 --> 01:42:13.737
...for many years to come.

01:42:18.242 --> 01:42:21.536
Thank you, Gordon.
I can't tell you all how moved I am.

01:42:21.745 --> 01:42:23.330
I never in my wildest dreams...

01:42:23.746 --> 01:42:28.419
...imagined that I would be the object
of so much genuine affection.

01:42:35.717 --> 01:42:39.722
It makes it more difficult for
me to say what I'm now going to say.

01:42:42.352 --> 01:42:45.355
I do feel it's time
to set the record straight.

01:42:45.731 --> 01:42:48.357
I didn't come here
just as an administrator.

01:42:48.732 --> 01:42:51.152
I came to this hospital
to settle a score.

01:42:51.319 --> 01:42:52.153
What score?

01:42:52.819 --> 01:42:54.739
My father built
this hospital.

01:42:54.823 --> 01:42:56.448
But to his family...

01:42:56.824 --> 01:43:00.036
...he was an unmerciful tyrant.
An absolute dodo bird.

01:43:00.329 --> 01:43:01.329
Oh, no! Not live.

01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:03.227
Let's see where she goes.

01:43:03.263 --> 01:43:04.625
He drove my mother to drink.

01:43:04.833 --> 01:43:07.836
In fact, she went riding one time
and lost all her teeth.

01:43:08.253 --> 01:43:09.631
What? What?

01:43:10.337 --> 01:43:13.844
- the oldest daughter, the pretty,
charming one, became pregnant...

01:43:14.344 --> 01:43:16.928
...at 15 and was driven
out of the house.

01:43:17.346 --> 01:43:22.143
She was so terrified that her daughter
would bear the stigma of illegitimacy...

01:43:22.352 --> 01:43:26.440
...she changed her name and contracted
a disfiguring disease...

01:43:30.861 --> 01:43:34.823
...after moving to Tangiers, where
she raised the girl as her sister.

01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:37.242
But her one ambition...

01:43:37.326 --> 01:43:39.246
Any preference of shots
on this one?

01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:41.956
- was to become a nurse.

01:43:42.332 --> 01:43:45.962
So she returned to the States
and joined the staff right here...

01:43:46.336 --> 01:43:47.836
...at Southwest General.

01:43:48.838 --> 01:43:50.757
She worked here
and had to speak out...

01:43:50.841 --> 01:43:53.428
...wherever she saw injustice
and inhumanity.

01:43:53.845 --> 01:43:56.263
Don't you understand that,
Dr. Brewster?

01:43:56.347 --> 01:43:57.555
I never laid a hand on her.

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:00.727
Yes, you did. She was shunned
by all you nurses too.

01:44:01.351 --> 01:44:03.063
Give me something, one.
Not backs.

01:44:03.354 --> 01:44:05.648
Two and three go left and right.

01:44:05.856 --> 01:44:07.733
No, two go left!
Three go right!

01:44:07.942 --> 01:44:10.445
Her outspokenness threatened
you doctors.

01:44:10.862 --> 01:44:14.532
But she was deeply, deeply,
deeply loved...

01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:16.661
...by her brother.
- Her brother?

01:44:16.953 --> 01:44:19.329
This brother,
on the day of her death...

01:44:19.454 --> 01:44:22.958
...swore to the good Lord above
he'd follow in her footsteps.

01:44:23.334 --> 01:44:25.544
And, and, and...

01:44:27.463 --> 01:44:29.631
...just, just, just...

01:44:31.343 --> 01:44:33.052
Don't, don't, don't panic.

01:44:33.346 --> 01:44:36.556
...owe it all up to her!
But on her terms!

01:44:36.931 --> 01:44:37.933
Here come the terms.

01:44:37.969 --> 01:44:39.559
As a woman...

01:44:39.935 --> 01:44:42.938
...and just as proud to be a woman...

01:44:43.939 --> 01:44:45.231
...as she ever was...

01:44:47.945 --> 01:44:50.529
...for I am not Emily Kimberly...

01:44:50.863 --> 01:44:53.659
...the daughter of Dwayne...

01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:56.827
...and Alma Kimberly.

01:44:57.954 --> 01:44:58.956
No, I'm not.

01:45:00.958 --> 01:45:03.960
I'm Edward Kimberly,
Anthea's reckless brother.

01:45:04.962 --> 01:45:06.046
Holy Christ!

01:45:07.965 --> 01:45:11.552
Edward Kimberly, who's finally
vindicated his sister's good name.

01:45:11.969 --> 01:45:13.054
I'm Edward Kimberly.

01:45:13.929 --> 01:45:15.395
Edward Kimberly.

01:45:15.431 --> 01:45:18.559
- I'll be damned.
- I'm not mentally ill, but proud...

01:45:18.935 --> 01:45:22.855
...and lucky to be the woman
that was the best part of my manhood.

01:45:24.442 --> 01:45:25.735
The best part of myself.

01:45:26.943 --> 01:45:29.738
That is one nutty hospital.

01:45:30.531 --> 01:45:33.032
I knew there was a reason
she didn't like me!

01:45:33.451 --> 01:45:34.242
Cut it!

01:45:34.952 --> 01:45:35.745
Cut!

01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:54.348
Does Jeff know?

01:46:47.571 --> 01:46:48.865
Hey, Robert.

01:46:58.540 --> 01:46:59.543
Hi, Les.

01:47:01.045 --> 01:47:02.046
Get him!

01:47:04.049 --> 01:47:05.174
All right!

01:47:07.552 --> 01:47:10.680
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Oh, come on.

01:47:52.682 --> 01:47:55.563
- I thought you'd want it back.
- Outside.

01:47:56.062 --> 01:47:58.065
Give it to me outside.

01:48:09.659 --> 01:48:11.245
Why'd you do it?

01:48:12.662 --> 01:48:14.249
I needed the work.

01:48:17.167 --> 01:48:20.753
The only reason you're still living is
because I never kissed you.

01:48:23.173 --> 01:48:25.469
I hope you enjoyed the chocolates.

01:48:27.179 --> 01:48:29.055
I gave them to a girl.

01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.266
So did I. I thought.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:34.477
Do you like them?

01:48:34.685 --> 01:48:36.271
- Chocolates?
- Girls!

01:48:37.647 --> 01:48:39.777
I like Julie.

01:48:41.652 --> 01:48:43.570
I think I love Julie.

01:48:44.154 --> 01:48:46.366
Wearing a dress is
a funny way to show it.

01:48:46.658 --> 01:48:48.868
I know. I apologize.

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:57.960
The truth is,
you were okay company.

01:48:59.171 --> 01:49:00.672
So were you.

01:49:00.756 --> 01:49:02.884
I could have done
without the dancing.

01:49:03.677 --> 01:49:05.679
You know, you're very good.

01:49:07.179 --> 01:49:10.476
- I'm seeing a real nice woman now.
- Oh, really?

01:49:11.683 --> 01:49:13.561
You think I didn't check her out?

01:49:16.689 --> 01:49:18.483
Can I buy you a beer?

01:49:21.153 --> 01:49:22.987
You got six bits.
Yeah.

01:49:24.656 --> 01:49:26.450
Can I have a couple of beers?

01:49:31.663 --> 01:49:33.876
Does Julie ever mention me?

01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:47.892
Taxi!

01:49:54.772 --> 01:49:55.856
Thank you.

01:50:29.769 --> 01:50:30.769
Hi.

01:50:33.271 --> 01:50:35.274
I saw your father.

01:50:37.275 --> 01:50:40.695
I drove up to see him
in that bar he hangs out at.

01:50:41.281 --> 01:50:42.657
He doesn't hang out there.

01:50:42.781 --> 01:50:45.368
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:50:46.786 --> 01:50:48.872
- How's Amy?
- Fine.

01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:54.587
Your dad and I had a couple of beers
and shot a good game of pool.

01:50:54.795 --> 01:50:57.798
We had a really good time together.

01:51:00.258 --> 01:51:01.469
How's it going?

01:51:04.765 --> 01:51:06.683
Terry Bishop's back on the show.

01:51:06.766 --> 01:51:08.268
April lost her license...

01:51:08.768 --> 01:51:11.563
- I meant with you.
- I know what you meant.

01:51:16.775 --> 01:51:19.197
So you're pretty hot
after your unveiling.

01:51:19.779 --> 01:51:21.197
What's your next triumph?

01:51:21.282 --> 01:51:23.284
I'm going to do this play with...

01:51:23.367 --> 01:51:24.994
Good. I've gotta catch a cab.

01:51:27.287 --> 01:51:31.000
Can I call you sometime?

01:51:35.882 --> 01:51:37.966
Look, I don't want to hold you up.

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.972
I just did it for the work.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

01:51:43.764 --> 01:51:45.265
Especially you.

01:51:57.361 --> 01:51:59.281
I miss Dorothy.

01:52:01.866 --> 01:52:03.870
You don't have to.

01:52:04.369 --> 01:52:05.495
She's right here.

01:52:08.372 --> 01:52:09.792
And she misses you.

01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:16.801
Look, you don't know me from Adam.

01:52:17.384 --> 01:52:21.387
But I was a better man with you,
as a woman...

01:52:21.887 --> 01:52:24.475
...than I ever was with a woman,
as a man.

01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:26.477
You know what I mean?

01:52:29.396 --> 01:52:33.276
I just gotta learn to do it
without the dress.

01:52:37.906 --> 01:52:41.201
At this point, there might be
an advantage to my wearing pants.

01:52:47.374 --> 01:52:50.502
The hard part's over,
you know?

01:52:51.379 --> 01:52:53.589
We were already...

01:52:54.382 --> 01:52:56.007
...good friends.

01:53:05.977 --> 01:53:08.979
Will you loan me
that little yellow outfit?

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:11.401
Which one?

01:53:12.985 --> 01:53:14.986
- The Halston.
- The Halston?

01:53:15.487 --> 01:53:16.987
Oh, no!

01:53:17.489 --> 01:53:19.198
You'll ruin it.

01:53:19.992 --> 01:53:22.287
- You'll spill wine all over it.
- I will not.

01:53:22.995 --> 01:53:27.292
I'll loan it to you, but you gotta
give it back. It's my favorite...

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.085
What are you gonna use it for?
