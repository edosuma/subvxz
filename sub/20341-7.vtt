What a great day for a walk.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.208
And we didn't even
have to leave the backyard.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.416
It was nice of Bob
to put this out here
so we could see the outside.

01:16.416 --> 01:20.166
Yeah, but I wanna see
the outside even faster!

This is so much fun!

01:24.500 --> 01:26.375

01:26.375 --> 01:28.875
-Hissy?
-Whoa! Ooh!

01:28.875 --> 01:30.000
Whoa.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.458
-What's wrong?
-Oh!

01:32.458 --> 01:35.833
I woke up too early
and couldn't get back
to sleep.

01:35.833 --> 01:38.208
Oh, no!
You love sleep!

01:38.208 --> 01:40.375
Then this morning,
I broke a nail.

01:40.375 --> 01:41.250
-Who!
-(screams)

01:41.250 --> 01:43.833

01:45.583 --> 01:48.333
Runny the Bunny
stopped running.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.250
But that was your favorite toy.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.291
You loved chasing
Runny around!

01:52.291 --> 01:55.125
Yeah. Now it just lies there.

01:55.125 --> 01:58.166

02:05.333 --> 02:07.291
Bob put our treadmill there.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.291
You can still nap there
if you want.

02:09.291 --> 02:11.125
I do want.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.375
-Hissy?
-ARF can untangle the cat!

02:39.750 --> 02:41.291
Stay calm, Hissy!

02:41.291 --> 02:43.250
ARF will have you out
in a jiffy!

02:48.833 --> 02:51.583
And Runny the Bunny's
not working, too?

02:51.583 --> 02:54.416
Well, it looks like
you've had a really
tough morning.

02:54.416 --> 02:55.583
(whimpering)

(barking)

03:08.125 --> 03:09.583
Did you hear that, Rolly?

03:09.583 --> 03:12.375
Bob wants Hissy
to have a better day
than when it started.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.083
So we should
make that happen!

03:14.083 --> 03:17.458
We should take her out
on one of our missions!
She'd love that!

03:17.458 --> 03:19.833
Wait. Do we have a mission
to take her out on?

03:19.833 --> 03:23.458
Today our mission
is to make sure Hissy
has the best day ever.

But we really think
you're gonna like it!

04:21.250 --> 04:25.416
It's got trees and things
to jump on and lots of space
to run around and around!

04:25.416 --> 04:27.291
That does sound pretty nice.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.625
And we're here!

04:34.208 --> 04:37.583
You brought me to the dog park?

04:37.583 --> 04:41.458
Yep! It's a place that we love,
and we figured that you'd
love it here, too!

04:43.458 --> 04:44.958
You don't love it here, too?

wanna run off and play

-(Hissy gasps)
-Rolly: If you insist!

05:11.583 --> 05:15.583
Oh. This seems like
it might be kind of fun
to crawl through.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.458
Hissy (echoing):
I wonder why there
aren't any cat parks?

05:18.458 --> 05:21.833
How is it fair that dogs
have parks but not cats?

05:21.833 --> 05:24.625
What are you
doin' here, pussycat?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.875

05:29.583 --> 05:31.833

their big sister.

05:31.833 --> 05:35.375
Well, then, I should be as nice
to you as I am to them,

05:35.375 --> 05:37.583

to them at all. So, Rufus!

we don't see one now.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.708

So we'll go this way!
Come on!

I guess a dog park
wasn't the best place.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.833

pet toys, everything
you need for your pet!

06:51.958 --> 06:55.375
And they let people
bring pets in here
to pick out what they want.

You wanna play hide-and-seek
with me and Rolly?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.583
I don't know.
I think I'd--

07:17.583 --> 07:19.708
-Not it!
-Not it!

07:19.708 --> 07:21.625
Give us a minute to hide!

07:21.625 --> 07:23.291
Then come find us
where we're hiding!

07:24.458 --> 07:26.458
I might give you
more than a minute!

-(whimpering)

10:57.708 --> 11:01.125
Except, I mean,
it wasn't all bad.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.708
I found out I could run
faster than those dogs
at the park.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.958
You were like a rocket. Zoom!

11:06.958 --> 11:10.625
And I got a pretty good nap
at the pet store.

11:10.625 --> 11:13.875
Even though I got woken up
with a kiss from an iguana.
(groans)

11:13.875 --> 11:15.083
That'd wake me up.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.291
And when I was on the roof
of that train,

11:17.291 --> 11:20.583
I felt like I was
queen of the world up there.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.583
So, you actually
had a pretty good day?

11:22.583 --> 11:27.125
Yeah! And the best part was
whenever I got into trouble,

11:27.125 --> 11:29.750
the two of you rescued me,

11:29.750 --> 11:32.083
which made me feel
kind of special.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.625
You are special.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.875
Yeah! You're
our kitty big sister!

11:35.875 --> 11:37.750
I know. And thanks.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.708
Bob:
Hey, there, pet pals!

11:39.708 --> 11:42.000
Ha! How was everybody's day?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.166
(barking)

11:43.166 --> 11:45.000
Hissy, I know
you had a bad morning,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.833
but this'll cheer you up.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.875
I fixed your toy
at work to make it

11:48.875 --> 11:52.125
so Runny the Bunny is
even more runny than before!

11:52.125 --> 11:54.583
It is more runny!

11:54.583 --> 11:58.250
-Can we chase it with you?
-Hey! Runny the Bunny
is mine!

11:59.208 --> 12:00.875
(whimpering)

12:00.875 --> 12:03.458
Which means there's no way
you can catch it before I do,

12:03.458 --> 12:05.166
so I'd like to see you try!

12:05.166 --> 12:06.875
-Yeah!
-I'm on it!

12:06.875 --> 12:09.333
Almost done!
Hang on, Hissy!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.416
Haha! Go guys, go!

12:13.416 --> 12:14.750
(barking)

12:17.000 --> 12:18.625
(Bingo/Rolly speak)

12:19.958 --> 12:22.291
Rolly:
I spy something
colorful and posty!

12:22.291 --> 12:24.125
Is it that fence?

12:24.125 --> 12:25.875
Yeah!

12:25.875 --> 12:29.291
I spy... something red
and bricky!

12:29.291 --> 12:30.583
Is it the chimney?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.250
It is!

12:32.250 --> 12:35.750
I spy...
Bob and ARF!

12:35.750 --> 12:37.000
Is it Bob and ARF?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.083
It's Bob and ARF!

12:38.083 --> 12:39.083
-Bob!
-Bob!

12:39.083 --> 12:40.583
-(barking)
-Hey, guys!

12:40.583 --> 12:41.875
Check out what I did to ARF!

12:43.500 --> 12:48.083
Your Auto-Doggie
Robotic Friend is now perfect
for carrying two pups!

12:48.083 --> 12:50.875
Arf! Arf!
Who's ready to ride?

12:50.875 --> 12:52.208
-I am!
-We are!

12:52.208 --> 12:53.750
(laughing)

12:53.750 --> 12:56.708
I've programmed ARF
to take you anywhere
you wanna go.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.958
So let's see if he works.

12:58.958 --> 13:04.000
Take my little puppy passengers
all the way around the yard
and to their doghouse.

13:07.416 --> 13:08.416
(Hissy meows)

13:09.416 --> 13:11.500
-Wee!
-Go, ARF, go!

13:13.750 --> 13:15.000
Uh-oh! (shrieks)

13:19.583 --> 13:21.125
(angry chattering)

13:21.125 --> 13:22.875
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

13:22.875 --> 13:24.166
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13:25.166 --> 13:26.750
(whimpers)

13:26.750 --> 13:29.458
Rolly:
Whoa!

13:29.458 --> 13:31.458
Look out for that pool!

13:31.458 --> 13:34.333
Oh! Ha. Oh, I didn't make
ARF waterproof yet,

13:34.333 --> 13:36.291
and if he gets wet,
he'll go... (buzzes)

13:36.291 --> 13:38.750
and not work
the way I made him to.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.416
So ARF needs to stay dry.

13:41.416 --> 13:45.166
That was the most fun
we ever had getting
to our doghouse ever!

13:45.166 --> 13:49.333
Where else would Bingo and Rolly
like ARF to take them today?

13:49.333 --> 13:51.583
We should go see Cagey
at the pet store!

13:51.583 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, we love Cagey!

13:53.000 --> 13:56.125
Stay here, ARF,
while Rolly and I
get ready for our mission!

13:56.125 --> 14:00.166

to ARF!

14:57.416 --> 14:59.500
I see, I see!

14:59.500 --> 15:02.125
I see everything
from this window.

15:02.125 --> 15:05.166
Mostly, cars driving by
and people making
funny faces at me,

15:05.166 --> 15:07.458
but I enjoy the view.

15:07.458 --> 15:11.125
Bob made ARF to take us
anywhere we wanna go,
and we came to see you.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.875
Yeah, I see that!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.000
Where do you think we should
have him take us next?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.416
How about
my favorite beach?

15:18.416 --> 15:20.125
When I'm running
on my wheel,

15:20.125 --> 15:23.083
I like to pretend
I'm running there!

15:23.083 --> 15:26.458
(mimicking squeaking
wheel in slow-motion)

15:27.875 --> 15:30.166
ARF has never been
to a beach,

15:30.166 --> 15:32.291
but ARF would love to go.

15:32.291 --> 15:36.208
Think how great it would feel
to put your paws in that water.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.458
You wanna come with us?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.166
I would, but, um...

15:39.166 --> 15:42.250
there's a delivery of fresh
guinea pig food coming in today,

15:42.250 --> 15:44.416
and I want to see it
when it gets here.

15:44.416 --> 15:47.750
-I spy a picture
of a guinea pig!
-It's the same picture

15:47.750 --> 15:49.500
that's on the side
of the delivery truck,

15:49.500 --> 15:53.833
and... I just love seein'
that truck drivin' up
to this window!

15:53.833 --> 15:57.250
Okay, then. ARF,
take us to the beach!

15:57.250 --> 15:59.375
For sure, dudes.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.625
That's how dudes
talk at the beach.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.000
Then take us there,
for sure!

And really tippy-tally, too.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.875
I spy something windy.

-(wind blows)
-Whoa, that's
extra-super-windy!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000

I spy something that looks
like the beach

16:56.000 --> 16:57.708
from Cagey's calendar.

Hey! It's the beach

17:02.166 --> 17:04.500
Let's put our paws
in the water like Cagey said!

(sighs) That's nice.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.291
(laughing)

17:12.583 --> 17:15.166
Hey, that wave came in
and took our paws away with it!

17:15.166 --> 17:18.416
-No, it didn't.
-Oh, there they are.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.166
Yeah, I miss him.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.958
ARF misses Bob, too.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.500
ARF! Bob said you weren't
supposed to get wet!

17:27.500 --> 17:31.208
Yeah, he said you'd go...
(buzzes)

17:31.208 --> 17:33.250
and not work the way
he made you to.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.875
(clanging)

17:34.875 --> 17:36.583
-That's a new one.
-(buzzing)

17:38.250 --> 17:40.291
I've never heard
that sound before.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.708
Come on, ARF!
Let's get out of the water
and get back to Bob's house!

17:43.708 --> 17:46.000
ARF, we're ready to go home.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.708
Sorry, ARF is not ready
or set to do that, because...

17:50.708 --> 17:52.875
ARF forgot the way.

17:52.875 --> 17:56.708
-What?
-It's because of the water
ARF put his paws in.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.291
It really did make
ARF go... (buzzes)

17:59.291 --> 18:02.416
and now, ARF does not remember.

You two doggies look sad,
is somethin' wrong?

18:27.250 --> 18:30.875
Yeah. We told ARF
to bring us here,
but then he got wet,

18:30.875 --> 18:32.875
and he doesn't know
how to take us home.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.000

Oh! Well, in that case,
I don't know where that is.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.583
What are we supposed to do
if we can't get back?

18:52.583 --> 18:55.208
We could play
"I Spy" some more.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.833

-Yep.

Really? 'Cause I was

19:02.458 --> 19:05.166
Rolly, that's a great idea.

19:05.166 --> 19:08.583
If you can remember
all the things you "I Spied"
on the way getting here,

19:08.583 --> 19:11.375
Jonathan can fly around
and see them and show us
the way back!

19:11.375 --> 19:14.333
You mean like how I spied
something green and pointy?

19:14.333 --> 19:17.458
Oh, I can find you somethin'
green and pointy.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.458
Follow me!

19:19.458 --> 19:22.375
ARF is ready and set
to follow Jonathan!

19:22.375 --> 19:23.458
So let's go!

19:28.416 --> 19:32.583
Let's see, green and pointy.
Green and pointy.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.250
Hey! There it is!

19:35.583 --> 19:38.250
(sing-songy)
We're here!

19:38.250 --> 19:39.458
Green and pointy!

19:39.458 --> 19:42.583
Ow! Ooh!
Definitely pointy!

19:42.583 --> 19:45.708
But this isn't the right kind
of green and pointy thing
that I spied.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.416
It isn't? Ow!

19:47.416 --> 19:49.875
Do you remember
spying anything else, Rolly?

19:49.875 --> 19:53.458
Um, I think I remember
spying something windy.

19:53.458 --> 19:56.250
Well, then I'll take you
to somethin' windy!

19:56.250 --> 19:58.583
And ARF will follow you there!

20:02.250 --> 20:05.958
I present to you,
somethin' windy!

20:05.958 --> 20:08.458
Jonathan, this isn't
what I spied, either.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.833
The windy thing that I saw
was a different kind of winding.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.500
We're not getting any closer
to home, Bingo.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
And I'm missing Bob
more and more.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.250
I miss him, too.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.416
And so does ARF.
So that makes three times
Bob is being missed.

20:22.416 --> 20:24.375
If we're ever gonna
get back home,

20:24.375 --> 20:26.375
we're gonna have to get down
this mountain first.

down the mountain!

a gas station at the bottom
of a mountain?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.583
I don't think so.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.583
Well, you're about
to spy it now, 'cause...

21:20.583 --> 21:22.458
♪ There it is! ♪

21:26.583 --> 21:28.500
ARF has arrived!

21:28.500 --> 21:31.291
Thanks, ARF.
But we still have to get home,

21:31.291 --> 21:33.333
and we still don't know
how to get there.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.875
Maybe if you remember
anything else you spied,

21:35.875 --> 21:37.708
I can fly around until I see it.

21:37.708 --> 21:40.083
Uh, it's hard to remember.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.333
I mean, I started out
spying Cagey,

21:42.333 --> 21:45.375
and then spying a picture
of a guinea pig on the side
of that empty box.

21:46.458 --> 21:48.583
Was it a picture just like that?

21:48.583 --> 21:50.708
Bingo:
Look! It's the delivery truck

21:50.708 --> 21:52.875
on its way to the pet store
where Cagey lives!

21:52.875 --> 21:56.333
(gasps) Which means,
we need to follow that truck!

21:56.333 --> 21:58.708
It means ARF needs
to follow that truck.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.583
So, here ARF goes.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.458
Bingo:
Thanks for the help, Jonathan!

22:02.458 --> 22:04.458
I'll be singing you...

22:04.458 --> 22:06.875
♪ Next time ♪

22:18.375 --> 22:19.708
ARF has arrived!

22:19.708 --> 22:21.500
And so has Cagey's food!

22:23.208 --> 22:28.333
Hey, guys! That truck's
a pretty sight, isn't it?

22:28.333 --> 22:30.583
Hey, did you make it
to the beach?

22:30.583 --> 22:33.291
Yeah, but we're ready
to get home.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.375
Come on, ARF!
We know the way from here,

22:35.375 --> 22:36.708
so you can follow us.

22:36.708 --> 22:39.125
ARF is ready and set
to follow you.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.458
So, let's go.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.708
Where were you guys all day?

22:45.708 --> 22:48.125
ARF took the puppies
wherever they wanted to go.

22:48.125 --> 22:52.250
But ARF went... (buzzes)
and forgot how to bring
them back.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.625
-But you got back.
-Because Rolly remembered
what he spied.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.416
Yeah, but all that remembering
has worn this puppy out.

22:58.416 --> 23:00.000
(yawns)

23:03.708 --> 23:06.208
Hey, there, everybody!

23:06.208 --> 23:09.000
Look at you guys,
just lyin' here
on the couch?

23:09.000 --> 23:13.875
Ha! I thought you'd
use ARF to take you all kinds
of different places all day.

23:13.875 --> 23:19.000
But I'm glad you're right here,
because I'd really miss you
if you ever weren't.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.708
ARF spies Bob
and his best friends!

23:21.708 --> 23:22.833
-Arf! Arf!
-(barking)

23:22.833 --> 23:24.708
We went to the mountains!

23:24.708 --> 23:26.000
We went to the beach!

23:26.000 --> 23:28.583
-(laughing)
-(barking)

23:28.583 --> 23:29.500
Bob:
Hey!

23:32.208 --> 23:34.583
(theme music playing)

23:35.625 --> 23:36.875
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:40.875 --> 23:41.958
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.708 --> 23:44.875
(record scratching)

23:52.166 --> 23:53.166
Bark!

23:56.625 --> 23:57.750
Bark! Bark! Bark!
