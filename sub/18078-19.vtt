WEBVTT

00:00.797 --> 00:02.648
I think Barry's in real trouble.

00:02.680 --> 00:04.046
We've gotta find Barry's parrot.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.195
There is no parrot.

00:05.203 --> 00:07.734
You have nothing to worry about.

00:10.787 --> 00:12.607
Well, shiver me timbers...

00:12.632 --> 00:15.958
he's discovered the map
to the sunken treasure.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.877
This cross is made of solid gold

00:18.911 --> 00:20.337
We go after the treasure.

00:20.971 --> 00:24.424
You keep that, you'll be
doomed for all eternity.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.752
I'll take me chances.

00:25.784 --> 00:28.470
How am I supposed to keep him
occupied for 15 minutes?

00:28.489 --> 00:30.556
Hey, this is getting interesting.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.351
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.476 --> 00:36.103
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.228 --> 00:37.688
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.813 --> 00:39.022
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:40.649
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.691 --> 00:42.317
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:43.986
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.946
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.071 --> 00:48.532
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:49.867
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.908 --> 00:52.494
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:41.603 --> 02:42.896
Any luck, Barry?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.815
Hey, Mr. Maitland, what
are you still doing here?

02:44.898 --> 02:48.902
I thought I'd wait around and see what
our prize oceanographer's dug up.

02:49.027 --> 02:50.320
Great news.

02:51.154 --> 02:53.782
I've got a piece of the
hull for those tests.

02:53.991 --> 02:56.159
With any luck,
I think we can confirm.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.411
Well, that should be
some exhibit.

02:57.536 --> 02:59.079
You think we'll be able
to keep it, don't you?

02:59.162 --> 03:00.872
I mean, the Smithsonian is not
gonna come in and haul it out--

03:00.998 --> 03:03.166
No, no, no. It belongs
in California.

03:03.292 --> 03:05.961
- Now, you let me worry about that.
- Yes, sir.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.922
- Have a good evening, Barry.
- You, too, Mr. Maitland.

03:21.852 --> 03:23.395
What did you find, Barry?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.314
What're you guys doing here?

03:25.397 --> 03:27.941
You've been taking a boat out
every day for a week.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.818
You found something out there.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.946
- Just routine dives.
- I don't think so, me young friend.

03:33.030 --> 03:36.700
Now, we're gonna know what you
found, one way or another.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.243
Now...

03:39.244 --> 03:41.830
you was gonna
answer the question.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.585
I've got to have this
thing back in three hours, Face...

03:46.668 --> 03:50.297
or Dr. Richter's gonna be very upset when
he finds out that I borrowed his limo.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.383
It's gonna set the trust aspect of
our therapy back three years...

03:53.467 --> 03:55.302
not to mention the fact that
he's gonna strangle me.

03:55.385 --> 04:00.182
Would you relax, Murdock, you have
nothing to worry about, okay?

04:00.307 --> 04:03.518
Besides, you are getting the
better end of this little deal.

04:03.602 --> 04:04.770
Oh, you think so?

04:04.853 --> 04:08.315
Trading two plane tickets to Cabo
for a night in Richter's limo...

04:08.398 --> 04:12.110
just so you can impress a bunch of
people you haven't seen in 20 years!

04:12.152 --> 04:14.404
I'm not trying to impress
a bunch of people...

04:14.488 --> 04:16.781
I haven't seen in 20 years,
for crying out loud.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.992
I have only one purpose
in coming today...

04:19.868 --> 04:22.287
Rebecca Piper.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.957
Of course, she hardly gave
me the time a day back then.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.126
Called me
a minor league hustler.

04:28.251 --> 04:29.795
- What, you?
- Yeah.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.005
You can't imagine
how many times...

04:32.089 --> 04:34.966
I asked her to go for a
walk by the garden pond.

04:35.592 --> 04:38.470
That was the go signal
back then...

04:38.553 --> 04:40.472
go for a walk
by the garden pond.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.891
Well, what makes you think that
her standards have plunged...

04:42.974 --> 04:44.309
after all these years?

04:44.434 --> 04:46.853
Just don't forget
what to do, okay?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.647
Give me 20 minutes
to circulate...

04:48.688 --> 04:51.608
lay down the back-story
of my stunning career...

04:51.691 --> 04:53.777
and home in on Rebecca Piper.

04:53.819 --> 04:55.529
- Then--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:55.612 --> 04:59.408
Just try not
to spill any champagne back there...

04:59.533 --> 05:01.243
Mr. Bond.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.934
You're not gonna
park it here, are you?

05:26.059 --> 05:28.437
I don't want this car parked
next to any another vehicle.

05:28.520 --> 05:32.107
I don't even want the exhaust from
another vehicle to touch this car.

05:32.190 --> 05:35.318
And you, I want you to
stay right where you are.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.654
I will let you out.

05:46.705 --> 05:49.207
Murdock, you sure you don't wanna
put a fence up around the car?

05:49.291 --> 05:50.333
No.

05:53.003 --> 05:56.006
- Three hours, Faceman. Three hours.
- No problem.

06:16.234 --> 06:19.905
And what do you think is the most
direct route from here to the airport?

06:28.622 --> 06:29.873
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:29.956 --> 06:33.168
Yes, Peck, Templeton Peck.

06:33.251 --> 06:34.669
Templeton.

06:34.878 --> 06:37.631
Debra. Oh, my gosh.

06:37.714 --> 06:41.468
Debra Garrity?
My... You look...

06:41.816 --> 06:43.169
You look great.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.681
Still the same, Templeton?
Chasing all the girls?

06:47.516 --> 06:51.770
- Have you seen Rebecca Piper here?
- Yes.

06:51.937 --> 06:54.731
As a matter of fact, she was
asking about you, Templeton.

06:54.856 --> 06:57.150
Really? Was she alone?

06:57.234 --> 07:00.779
I mean, she wasn't dragging a
husband around with her, was she?

07:00.862 --> 07:02.697
I don't think so. Why?

07:02.906 --> 07:04.908
Come on, Debra, you remember me.

07:04.991 --> 07:08.870
I remember you used to like to
take a walk by the garden pond.

07:13.708 --> 07:15.043
Oh, I forgot.

07:15.710 --> 07:19.172
Barry Green sent you this letter.
I guess he won't be here today.

07:19.297 --> 07:22.842
Well, I'm very sorry, I was
looking forward to seeing him.

07:23.093 --> 07:25.470
You wanted to sell him
Bobby Moore's bicycle again?

07:25.554 --> 07:29.516
I could explain that. Well,
if you'll excuse me, I...

07:29.599 --> 07:31.101
It's been nice seeing you.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.978
Rebecca.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.316
Rebecca Piper.

07:38.441 --> 07:40.652
Templeton Peck.

07:41.987 --> 07:44.281
We sure have grown up,
haven't we?

07:44.614 --> 07:47.784
Yes, indeed.
Yes. Haven't we?

07:49.077 --> 07:52.414
I remember you used to always wanna
take me for a walk by the garden pond.

07:52.497 --> 07:54.583
Yeah, still do.

07:54.916 --> 07:56.876
You should never stop asking.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.337
Excuse me, Templeton Peck?

07:59.963 --> 08:03.675
Me? Oh, no, I'm
Teddy Pendleton. I...

08:05.051 --> 08:07.846
Oh, this? I must have picked
up the wrong nametag.

08:07.971 --> 08:10.765
Don't let the uniform scare you.
I'm just a meter maid.

08:10.974 --> 08:14.686
I'm Barry Green's sister. Barry
Green doesn't have a sister.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.272
When he was 16,
my family adopted him.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.982
Oh, well, that's great--

08:19.065 --> 08:21.818
Listen, I came today
hoping you'd be here.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.653
I haven't heard from
Barry in two weeks.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.572
Well, I haven't heard
from Barry in 20 years.

08:25.655 --> 08:27.365
I know he's been
working a lot lately...

08:27.407 --> 08:29.367
but it's just not
like him to disappear.

08:29.451 --> 08:31.202
I see. Well...

08:33.705 --> 08:36.457
Look, he left this letter
for me at the desk there.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.460
See, so he's probably just
out of town or something.

08:38.543 --> 08:40.919
Well, could you open it? Maybe
it says where he's gone.

08:42.631 --> 08:45.550
If you will excuse me, I'll be
back in just a minute, okay?

08:48.678 --> 08:51.389
- Well.
- Peck. Templeton Peck.

08:51.473 --> 08:53.475
Good seeing you, Lester.
How you been?

08:53.558 --> 08:54.643
- I'm great.
- Great.

08:54.684 --> 08:57.979
I was just telling Rebecca here how I've
been test flying F-16's for Lockheed.

08:58.063 --> 08:59.814
You know, kind of putting
them through their paces...

08:59.898 --> 09:02.108
make sure they're safe for our
boys in uniform and all that.

09:02.161 --> 09:04.088
Hey, I had to bail out
of one just last week.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.052
Really?

09:05.111 --> 09:08.365
Well, I've been doing a lot of
work myself at Cape Canaveral.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.200
Well, didn't I read something
about you in Vietnam?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.826
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Intelligence work.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.620
I'll tell you
all about it, later.

09:13.703 --> 09:16.498
No, no, this was some kind of trouble.
Aren't you--

09:16.581 --> 09:19.292
All this talk about
careers is so boring.

09:19.376 --> 09:23.922
I mean, we all go through changes,
but the end results are so obvious.

09:24.089 --> 09:25.173
Yeah.

09:25.507 --> 09:27.258
Come on, the pond is waiting.

09:36.017 --> 09:38.770
It's so good to see you
after all these years.

09:39.062 --> 09:42.190
Yes, well, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.819
You know
what this means to me...

09:46.444 --> 09:49.906
you coming here today and all?
Tell me.

09:50.073 --> 09:52.325
It means $10,000.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.077
Ten...

09:57.789 --> 10:00.500
Nothing like a reunion to bring
old friends together, huh, Peck?

10:00.709 --> 10:04.379
Yeah, I'm sorry we haven't
stayed in touch, General, but...

10:04.462 --> 10:05.922
- Come on. Party's over.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:06.047 --> 10:08.591
Look, I understand, Rebecca,
they made you do this.

10:09.134 --> 10:10.301
I understand.

10:13.263 --> 10:14.389
Up the stairs.

10:17.142 --> 10:19.144
Temp, I think Barry's
in real trouble.

10:19.227 --> 10:21.396
Join the club.
Get out of the way, lady.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.042
Got a light, General?

10:54.512 --> 10:56.848
No, not behind the limo!

11:15.116 --> 11:16.493
Come on, Captain.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.871
- I can't leave this car!
- Forget the car!

11:24.709 --> 11:25.502
Go!

11:25.585 --> 11:26.753
Come on!

12:21.266 --> 12:22.308
Let's go!

12:32.360 --> 12:34.696
Rich is gonna
be here in 24 hours.

12:34.821 --> 12:38.449
I've got to get that limo bonded.
I've got to get the tires fixed!

12:38.533 --> 12:40.326
I've got to get it
back from the army!

12:40.451 --> 12:44.038
What is the matter with you two?
Showing up at a place like that.

12:44.205 --> 12:45.790
I didn't tell him, Face,
I didn't.

12:45.874 --> 12:48.918
- He made me do it, Hannibal.
- I warned you about going.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.506
And you give me this song and dance about
not caring anything about reunions.

12:53.590 --> 12:58.386
Fulbright probably subscribes to
your alumni newsletter, Lieutenant.

12:58.469 --> 13:02.265
I can't believe that Fulbright
would sink that low.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.476
That he would find an unrequited
love, from my youth...

13:05.560 --> 13:07.353
and force her to set me up.
That's...

13:07.437 --> 13:09.689
She's after the reward, Face.

13:09.772 --> 13:12.692
Boy, Hannibal,
you are so cynical.

13:13.151 --> 13:15.278
I can't believe this.

13:15.737 --> 13:18.948
I mean she... You should've seen the tears
in her eyes as Fulbright led me away.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.325
She wanted to warn me.

13:21.284 --> 13:22.952
She'd be in trouble
with the government--

13:23.036 --> 13:24.370
Trouble?
I'll give you trouble.

13:24.454 --> 13:26.164
I lost Richter's limo...

13:26.289 --> 13:28.917
and then I get
ticketed by some meter maid.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.628
Now, who tickets
in front of an orphanage?

13:32.128 --> 13:34.923
Elaine. Oh, you know this
meter maid by name, huh?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.133
Yeah. Well, good, you
can fix the ticket!

13:37.216 --> 13:39.969
Well, she's Barry's sister.

13:40.136 --> 13:43.473
Now Barry's in trouble, and, well,
she needs our help, Hannibal.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.684
- She's a cop, Face.
- She's a meter maid.

13:46.768 --> 13:48.269
Look, I really think
we should help her.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.229
Sounded like Barry was
in a lot of trouble.

13:50.313 --> 13:53.650
Besides,
maybe she could fix this.

13:53.775 --> 13:56.819
Look, we'll find the limo,
we'll repair it.

13:56.986 --> 13:58.571
Richter will
never know the difference.

13:58.696 --> 14:00.406
Hannibal, can you
think of something?

14:01.032 --> 14:04.577
Well, maybe we can kill
two birds with one stone.

14:05.703 --> 14:07.080
We'll give it a try.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.362
Thank goodness
you guys got here.

14:39.445 --> 14:42.407
- You wanna tell us what's going on?
- Sure.

14:46.327 --> 14:47.954
You can't park here.

14:48.079 --> 14:51.124
It's illegal to park
within 30 feet of a corner.

14:58.923 --> 15:00.091
They took the envelope...

15:00.174 --> 15:01.801
that Barry left for you
at the reunion.

15:01.884 --> 15:03.886
Well, what was on it?

15:04.387 --> 15:06.264
A note. Something like...

15:06.389 --> 15:08.099
"A lot of people are after this."

15:08.266 --> 15:10.727
"I'm sure you'll recognize it
and know what to do."

15:10.810 --> 15:13.896
- Me? Why would I recognize it?
- I don't know.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.982
Well, there was an old map, too.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.900
An old map?

15:18.401 --> 15:22.905
Yeah, like something
out of an Errol Flynn movie.

15:23.114 --> 15:26.034
No, it couldn't be.
It was 20 years ago.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.537
- Could you draw us this map?
- Yeah, I think so.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.801
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait. Wait a minute.

15:43.885 --> 15:46.387
Did it curve around at the
bottom, here, like this?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.557
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:49.599 --> 15:51.392
And then up here...

15:51.559 --> 15:54.812
this part looked like the boot of
Italy turned around backwards?

15:55.063 --> 15:56.856
I think it needs to be
colored in over here.

15:56.939 --> 15:58.357
Get out of here, would you?

15:58.566 --> 16:02.070
And then, there was a little square
right over here, like that, right?

16:02.945 --> 16:04.822
That's it, that's it!
You saw it?

16:04.947 --> 16:07.492
- What is it, Face?
- It's a treasure map.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.785
A treasure map?

16:08.868 --> 16:12.080
This is a map to
Long John Silver's treasure.

16:16.084 --> 16:17.794
Well, shiver me timbers...

16:17.877 --> 16:21.380
he's discovered the map
to the sunken treasure.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.675
Well, it's not the real map,
see, I drew it.

16:24.759 --> 16:26.636
You traced it, actually.

16:26.761 --> 16:30.306
From Treasure Island, Scribner's
Edition, 1951, I believe.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.141
It had a parrot on the cover.

16:32.308 --> 16:35.895
It just so happens
it was Rand McNally, 1916...

16:36.104 --> 16:37.605
but you're right
about the parrot.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.024
Yes, but you happen
to be mistaken.

16:40.108 --> 16:41.901
Look, I'm the one who traced it.

16:42.944 --> 16:44.695
And gave it
to your friend, Barry.

16:44.862 --> 16:47.740
No. Well, I sold it to him.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.868
We were kids.
I can't believe it.

16:50.993 --> 16:52.745
He always told me
you were his friend.

16:52.829 --> 16:55.081
I was his friend.
I am his friend.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.625
You don't sell a map
like that to just anybody.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.920
How many times
did you con this guy, Face?

17:01.003 --> 17:02.964
I bet he was
your number one stooge.

17:03.047 --> 17:05.174
He talked about you constantly.

17:05.508 --> 17:08.845
- Always told me what a great guy you were.
- I am a great guy.

17:08.970 --> 17:13.015
Barry was interested in pirates, and
for $20, I sold him a treasure map.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.518
I'm glad I didn't know you
when I was a kid.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.771
- No, wait. You can't do that!
- Oh, no?

17:19.856 --> 17:22.400
I can't believe it. We come to
help you, and what do you do?

17:22.483 --> 17:24.902
You fingered my limo right
outside a place of worship!

17:24.986 --> 17:26.069
I'm sorry.

17:26.154 --> 17:29.448
I didn't know it was your car,
but it was illegally parked.

17:29.532 --> 17:32.316
Yeah, well, maybe now you'll think
of retrieving my vehicle...

17:32.341 --> 17:34.328
from the Army Tow Corp.

17:34.412 --> 17:37.206
Look, could we stick to one
problem at a time here?

17:37.874 --> 17:41.210
Why would those guys
want a phony pirate map...

17:41.377 --> 17:44.005
that Face gave Barry
20 years ago?

17:56.601 --> 17:58.686
You're gonna show
us how to read this thing!

17:58.769 --> 18:00.646
You gotta take us
to the treasure!

18:01.105 --> 18:03.024
There is no treasure!

18:03.733 --> 18:05.193
That thing is worthless!

18:05.276 --> 18:09.447
I'm getting tired of hearing
that tune, laddie. Too bad.

18:09.572 --> 18:12.283
This is where the sharks
come to feed, you know?

18:12.408 --> 18:16.204
What do you say we chum
up the waters, hey, boys?

18:39.352 --> 18:42.647
Wouldn't you rather come up here
and talk to us on the boat?

18:49.278 --> 18:51.239
All right! All right!
Pull me up!

18:51.572 --> 18:53.616
Sounds like
he's changed his mind.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.327
- Shall we pull him in, Captain?
- Pull me up!

19:05.628 --> 19:07.922
Morgan, shall we haul him up?

19:08.714 --> 19:11.133
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Pull me up!

19:12.009 --> 19:13.511
All right, pull him up.

19:22.853 --> 19:26.440
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Pull me up! Hurry up!

19:35.157 --> 19:37.910
You're gonna take us on a
little treasure hunt today.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.745
There is no treasure.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.790
Look, they pay you to catch the
fish to feed the dolphins.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.751
They pay me to find
the exotic fish for the park.

19:45.835 --> 19:48.129
- That's all that I do.
- Don't lie to me, boy!

19:48.546 --> 19:51.424
You went to a great deal of trouble
to get that map to your sister.

19:51.716 --> 19:54.302
And when we find her,
she won't be a pretty sight.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.512
Put him back in the drink.

19:57.471 --> 19:59.682
No! All right, all right.

20:00.975 --> 20:02.351
I'll take you on your...

20:02.476 --> 20:05.730
I'll take you on your treasure hunt,
and I'll show you how to read the map.

20:05.896 --> 20:08.107
And it better
be a successful hunt.

20:08.774 --> 20:13.154
Or I'll cut you up and deliver
you to the shark tank.

20:17.742 --> 20:19.952
It's in here.
It's in here.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.121
Put that book down, fool!

20:22.538 --> 20:24.540
The parrot's never wrong.

20:26.042 --> 20:28.753
You should always listen to the parrot.
He has all of the answers.

20:28.836 --> 20:32.256
If you'd asked him, he would tell you
to check the Scribner's Edition.

20:36.093 --> 20:38.304
- Does this look familiar?
- That's it!

20:38.387 --> 20:39.722
That's exactly
what it looked like!

20:39.805 --> 20:42.850
Yeah, yeah, I traced it right out
of the book. There, see? Yeah.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.643
Of course, I sort of
Californiaized it, you know?

20:44.727 --> 20:46.145
Changed
"Here There Be Tygers"...

20:46.228 --> 20:49.273
to "Paradise Cove,"
and like that.

20:49.357 --> 20:52.443
Face, did you really sell your
best friend a fake treasure map?

20:52.610 --> 20:55.279
B.A., I needed
the money, okay?

20:56.364 --> 20:58.240
You know, Hannibal, I'm
worried about Rebecca.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.493
I mean, what if the
military has detained her?

21:00.618 --> 21:01.869
Well, if they detained her...

21:01.952 --> 21:05.289
it's because they wanted to take
back the reward they paid her.

21:05.373 --> 21:09.794
Anyway, somebody thinks this is
important enough to kidnap for.

21:09.877 --> 21:13.672
Come on, Hannibal. That's right
out of fantasyland! You know...

21:16.008 --> 21:17.051
Well...

21:17.593 --> 21:21.764
of course, if there was a
treasure, I'd own half of it...

21:21.889 --> 21:23.766
because I sold him
the map in the first place.

21:23.933 --> 21:24.892
Face?

21:25.476 --> 21:28.104
Okay, okay, Barry owns
the whole thing, okay?

21:28.604 --> 21:31.732
He'd want me to have half 'cause
he's a friend of mine, but...

21:31.816 --> 21:34.527
Does this have
any legitimacy at all?

21:34.652 --> 21:37.530
I mean, does it pertain to
any real place of any kind?

21:37.655 --> 21:39.865
Of course,
I was always very accurate.

21:40.116 --> 21:41.951
I measured distances
and everything.

21:42.118 --> 21:44.036
Barry was a very sharp kid.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.123
He was just a little gullible.

21:47.623 --> 21:50.709
If only we had a parrot,
he'd have all the answers.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.670
We've gotta find Barry's parrot.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.172
I don't think
Barry has a parrot.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.341
Long John Silver had a parrot.
Blackbeard had a parrot.

21:57.466 --> 22:00.094
Bluebeard had a parrot. He wasn't
even a pirate, but he had a parrot.

22:00.177 --> 22:02.221
Hey, man.
We ain't got a parrot.

22:02.513 --> 22:04.890
Look. Says it right here,
Colonel. Look at that.

22:05.182 --> 22:06.600
Pirates often talked
to their parrots...

22:06.684 --> 22:08.519
and the parrots repeated
what the pirates pronounced.

22:08.602 --> 22:10.604
Well, that's
a great help, Murdock.

22:12.606 --> 22:14.692
What do you wanna do, Captain?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.486
What any self-respecting
pirate would do.

22:18.028 --> 22:19.613
We go after the treasure.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.462
All right, the map says...

22:36.338 --> 22:40.634
100 paces from the
juncture of the dock...

22:41.010 --> 22:45.306
and the sea wall at 240 degrees.

22:46.515 --> 22:49.977
That's that way, 100 paces would
be just beyond that sand dune.

22:50.144 --> 22:51.729
Boy, this is ridiculous.

22:51.896 --> 22:53.856
There were no pirates
in California.

22:54.023 --> 22:57.151
It is plain you've never heard of
the bloody Frenchman, Bouchard.

22:57.484 --> 22:59.403
You mean we're really gonna dig?

22:59.862 --> 23:02.615
I think Barry was trying to send
Face some kind of a message.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.658
I think he wants us
to dig in this spot.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.912
Hey! Hey, that's
my treasure!

23:07.995 --> 23:09.622
Those are the guys
from the house!

23:19.798 --> 23:21.550
Not very friendly, are they?

23:33.938 --> 23:36.815
- Oh, I'm so glad you're all right.
- You found them.

23:36.899 --> 23:39.026
Yeah, I went to the reunion,
I found your letter.

23:39.109 --> 23:40.319
Thank you.

23:44.907 --> 23:48.577
What are you doing with those, Temp?
Hunting for buried treasure?

24:01.382 --> 24:03.634
Sending me that phony map.

24:03.759 --> 24:07.471
Barry, I mean, why didn't you just send
me a note telling me you had a problem?

24:07.972 --> 24:09.974
Look, I couldn't
take the chance, Temp.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.059
I had those jokers
all over my case...

24:12.142 --> 24:14.728
trying to find out where the
Santissima was located.

24:15.646 --> 24:19.233
I knew you'd recognize the fake
map and realize I needed help.

24:19.483 --> 24:22.027
Wait a minute,
what is the Santissima?

24:23.028 --> 24:25.864
It's a 17th century
Spanish galleon.

24:26.949 --> 24:29.952
It was on its way back from
the Philippines to Spain...

24:30.077 --> 24:34.873
when it was intercepted off Dana Point
by a French privateer named Bouchard.

24:34.957 --> 24:37.084
Bouchard?

24:37.293 --> 24:38.961
No, Bouchard.

24:40.004 --> 24:42.673
Now, the Captain scuttled
the ship, he sunk it...

24:42.798 --> 24:43.507
Thanks.

24:43.590 --> 24:46.051
...to keep Bouchard from getting
his hands on the treasure.

24:46.135 --> 24:49.305
- What treasure?
-  The usual, you know, gold, silver...

24:49.388 --> 24:51.807
and something
far more important.

24:52.182 --> 24:55.519
- Philip's Cross.
- What's Philip's Cross?

24:55.686 --> 24:59.315
It was a birthday present from the
governor general of the Philippines...

24:59.440 --> 25:02.109
to his Catholic Majesty,
Philip of Spain.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.819
Well, what makes it so valuable?

25:03.902 --> 25:09.033
This cross is made of solid
gold encrusted with jewels.

25:09.158 --> 25:11.327
Emeralds, rubies and sapphires--

25:11.410 --> 25:13.704
- Hey, this is getting interesting.
- Come on, Barry.

25:13.787 --> 25:16.206
Where'd you come up with
this cockamamie treasure?

25:16.332 --> 25:18.917
I mean, some old sailor
sell you a treasure map?

25:19.251 --> 25:22.838
Everything I'm telling you about the
Santissima and Philip's Cross...

25:23.088 --> 25:26.925
is absolute historical fact. You
can check it out at any library.

25:27.009 --> 25:29.053
I believe you.
Makes perfect sense.

25:29.178 --> 25:31.055
Are you gonna eat that pickle?

25:32.139 --> 25:33.891
No. No, help yourself.

25:34.850 --> 25:38.354
Well, if it's so valuable, why
hasn't someone gone after it before?

25:38.520 --> 25:42.858
They have. There have been literally
hundreds of attempts over the years...

25:42.941 --> 25:44.735
but nobody could
ever find the wreck.

25:44.818 --> 25:46.987
And then you come along
and, bingo!

25:47.071 --> 25:48.655
Hardly bingo.

25:49.198 --> 25:51.909
It's taken me five years
using a computer...

25:51.992 --> 25:55.329
to figure the currents and tidal
changes, continental drift...

25:55.412 --> 25:57.998
anything that could shift
the position of the wreck.

25:58.248 --> 25:59.333
And...

26:03.295 --> 26:05.339
from the Santissima's timbers.

26:12.679 --> 26:13.764
Guys...

26:14.598 --> 26:16.850
I say we help him
find the cross.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.937
Great! Thank you. Thanks.

26:20.270 --> 26:23.232
But you have to realize...

26:23.524 --> 26:26.318
the ship belongs to Marineland
once we pull it up.

26:26.568 --> 26:29.363
They want to haul it back
and turn it into an exhibit.

26:29.613 --> 26:34.243
As for the cross, I would like
to return it to the church.

26:34.535 --> 26:38.122
Actually, to Angels
Guardian Orphanage.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.458
Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea, Barry.

26:41.959 --> 26:43.335
I guess.

26:43.752 --> 26:44.711
Temp, you know...

26:44.795 --> 26:46.964
I really got to thank you
for helping me out.

26:47.756 --> 26:52.052
I feel kind of guilty since I took advantage
of you so often when we were kids.

26:52.553 --> 26:55.097
Took advantage of me?
You took advantage of me?

26:55.556 --> 26:58.100
What about the time I conned
you out of your tennis shoes?

26:58.183 --> 27:02.020
I learned to run barefoot. Set
a state record for the 440.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.565
Oh, Bobby Moore's bike?

27:04.648 --> 27:06.358
Bobby and I came out
of it great friends.

27:06.442 --> 27:10.154
You know, he's one of LA's top tax lawyers.
Does my returns for free.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.239
The phony treasure map?

27:12.322 --> 27:14.158
Ended up saving my life.

27:14.658 --> 27:16.785
You know,
I really owe you, buddy.

27:17.119 --> 27:20.164
Yes, you never can tell, Face.

27:20.622 --> 27:24.835
Tell me, do you have a chart
showing the location of the wreck?

27:24.918 --> 27:27.463
Sure, it's in my office...

27:28.464 --> 27:32.092
but, you know, Morgan and his goons
probably have the place staked out.

27:32.176 --> 27:34.261
That's okay, we'll pick it up.

27:37.097 --> 27:38.682
I bet this Bouchard is
real mean.

27:38.724 --> 27:41.185
Black hair, black heart,
black beard.

27:41.310 --> 27:43.562
I bet even his parrot
is blood-thirsty.

27:43.687 --> 27:45.022
Well, I don't know.

27:45.189 --> 27:48.192
Actually, none of my research
turned up any mention of a parrot.

27:48.358 --> 27:51.153
He had a parrot.
They all did.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.197
You cool it
with this parrot, Murdock.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.824
There is no parrot, and I don't
wanna hear another word about it.

27:55.908 --> 27:59.995
Well, actually, that's who has the
real treasure map, my parrot.

28:00.120 --> 28:04.082
See, the chart's in the bottom of
my parrot's cage in my office.

28:05.501 --> 28:07.002
Enough said.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.803
Damn bird!

28:16.887 --> 28:19.097
If you don't shut your beak,
I'll make soup out of you!

28:19.181 --> 28:20.641
Nothing in the desk, Captain.

28:27.231 --> 28:28.357
Hello.

28:28.982 --> 28:30.359
What's going on here?

28:32.528 --> 28:35.822
We was just looking for a clue
to finding Barry, Mr. Maitland.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.701
Well, in the future, you'll confine
your activities to delivering fish.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.765
Boy, Barry, you were playing
an awful long shot...

29:01.848 --> 29:03.517
leaving that note for me
at the reunion.

29:03.642 --> 29:07.062
Well, not really. Rebecca Piper kept
calling me about trying to find you.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.273
There, you see?
Huh?

29:09.356 --> 29:12.484
She seemed to think you'd show up
there, but she wanted to make sure.

29:12.568 --> 29:14.027
Kept saying something
about having...

29:14.111 --> 29:17.281
tens of thousands of reasons
for wanting to find you.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.331
- Well, I'm not going to say a word.
- Yeah, well...

29:20.642 --> 29:22.010
Wait a second.

29:22.183 --> 29:25.307
That's the car of the guys
who tried to kidnap me.

29:25.539 --> 29:26.790
Are you sure?

29:26.999 --> 29:30.085
Yeah, I remember the right tail
light was out. I wanted to tag him.

29:30.210 --> 29:32.462
Good. Maybe you can cut me a
citation, tow me a limo today...

29:32.504 --> 29:33.964
since we owe one
to Dr. Richter.

29:34.047 --> 29:36.174
Murdock, let's deal with
one disaster at a time.

29:36.258 --> 29:38.885
- You know where you're going?
- Dolphin Building, 211.

29:38.927 --> 29:42.222
- Map's at the bottom of the parrot cage.
- Right. You and Face get the chart.

29:42.306 --> 29:44.933
Elaine and I'll make a couple
of calls about Dr. Richter.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.185
That's a good idea,
Colonel. Aye-aye, sir.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.504
Well, it looks like
they beat us here, Face.

29:50.543 --> 29:52.733
Yeah, as long as
they didn't find that chart.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.533
- It's a nice bird.
- Nice bird.

30:01.617 --> 30:03.285
- Pretty bird.
- Pretty bird.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.622
Here we go.

30:11.668 --> 30:13.962
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, here.

30:14.463 --> 30:16.548
Look, I'm a friend
of Barry's, okay?

30:16.573 --> 30:18.425
Yeah, somebody has told
him about your relationship.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.503
Very funny.

30:20.636 --> 30:22.471
All right now.
Easy, easy.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.098
I think he's carnivorous.

30:25.182 --> 30:27.601
Come off of it, Face.
Parrots are not carnivorous.

30:27.684 --> 30:28.769
You just got him all riled up.

30:28.852 --> 30:31.480
- Let the master take over.
- Sure. Sure. By all means.

30:31.730 --> 30:35.317
Nice, birdie.
Nice birdie, birdie, birdie.

30:36.318 --> 30:39.363
See. You just have to show them
that you don't mean them any harm.

30:39.613 --> 30:41.281
He's setting you up.

30:44.660 --> 30:46.244
This parrot is a man-eater.

30:47.287 --> 30:50.624
Tell you what, let's let Barry get
the chart out of the cage, huh?

30:50.707 --> 30:52.376
- That's a good idea.
- Come on, let's go.

30:56.338 --> 30:59.132
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

31:08.933 --> 31:11.385
- <i>And up she goes!</i> 
- Oh, god!

31:34.793 --> 31:38.088
<i>Keep your eyes on the center of the
pool and get your cameras ready.</i>

31:42.175 --> 31:45.095
<i>Here comes Rosie,
Gypsy and Noodles.</i>

31:49.933 --> 31:51.351
<i>Around they go!</i>

31:57.566 --> 32:00.068
<i>That concludes our dolphin
show, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

32:00.193 --> 32:03.155
<i>Thanks for being such a great audience.
Do come back and see us again.</i>

32:12.831 --> 32:14.666
Hey, you brought the whole cage.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.334
- How you doing, Kidd?
- Hello, there.

32:16.418 --> 32:17.627
Any word on the limo?

32:17.711 --> 32:19.588
Well, I called
the army tow yard.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.007
Bad news, Murdock.
They cut it up.

32:22.090 --> 32:24.509
Oh, great, just great.

32:26.803 --> 32:28.555
Hey, you really
got him perturbed.

32:28.638 --> 32:31.558
I'm sorry, we didn't have
time to make friends.

32:31.641 --> 32:32.893
Let me try.

32:40.275 --> 32:44.112
One wrong move, bird, and you're
a feather duster. Got it?

32:44.946 --> 32:46.948
Nice bird, pretty bird.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.122
Now we need a boat.

32:58.376 --> 33:02.088
Please, Lieutenant, you said
you would control your temper.

33:02.380 --> 33:06.176
- Yo, Skipper.
- Is there a problem?

33:06.551 --> 33:10.931
Is there a problem? I got a dead
porpoise at the maritime morgue...

33:11.014 --> 33:13.308
with a Short's beer bottle
sticking out of its head...

33:13.391 --> 33:15.352
and you want to know
if I got a problem?

33:15.435 --> 33:18.104
Lieutenant, please.
Your name, sir?

33:18.146 --> 33:21.650
Don't tell him nothing, Pa. They can't
prove it's your bottle that did it.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.360
- Shut up, Alfred.
- That's it.

33:23.443 --> 33:25.278
That's it.
You, get out of the boat.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.447
Get out of the boat.

33:27.572 --> 33:29.741
Failing to provide
identification...

33:29.825 --> 33:31.868
to an officer involved
in a legal investigation...

33:31.952 --> 33:33.453
that's coming close
to a felony, sir.

33:33.578 --> 33:38.333
It's Gruber. Murray Gruber! Now, how
much is a fish like that worth, huh?

33:38.583 --> 33:40.544
$1 a pound, $2?

33:40.836 --> 33:44.631
$500, $1,000, how much is it worth?
How much?

33:44.673 --> 33:48.385
One of the most intelligent
mammals on the face of the earth.

33:48.593 --> 33:53.056
A protected species.
And you offer me a bribe?

33:53.390 --> 33:56.017
That's it! This vessel
and its contents...

33:56.184 --> 33:59.312
are hereby impounded by the
United States Coast Guard!

33:59.437 --> 34:02.732
- You can't take my boat!
- Oh, yeah?

34:03.222 --> 34:04.557
No!

34:09.697 --> 34:11.783
You might like to swim to the
harbormaster's office...

34:11.867 --> 34:13.326
where you can
contact an attorney.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.579
You might want to press
charges against the officer.

34:29.009 --> 34:32.929
The cross is in the captain's cabin
which is under the stern castle.

34:33.138 --> 34:35.514
- The tall structure in the back?
- You got it.

34:35.639 --> 34:36.766
Good luck.

36:24.124 --> 36:26.543
Yeah, this is a nice bird.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.381
Sorry.

36:32.215 --> 36:36.344
Well, maybe he's getting even with me
for everything I did to you as a kid.

36:37.178 --> 36:38.596
Wait. Wait.

36:39.139 --> 36:40.765
Temp, do you remember the day...

36:40.849 --> 36:42.976
that you conned me out of
my Allman Brothers tickets?

36:43.351 --> 36:46.771
Listen, Barry,
I never realized...

36:46.855 --> 36:48.440
how hard I was on you back then.

36:48.523 --> 36:51.276
And it's just that you were so easy.
You were like a proving ground to me.

36:51.359 --> 36:53.028
No, no, see...

36:53.403 --> 36:56.531
that was the day Elaine and her
family came to the orphanage.

36:56.698 --> 37:00.201
I had to be you for a couple of hours
while you were gone, remember?

37:00.285 --> 37:01.244
Yeah.

37:01.870 --> 37:05.623
They really liked me, and that was
the day they decided to adopt me.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.584
I told them the truth later.

37:08.543 --> 37:11.838
You told them you were me,
and they adopted you?

37:11.921 --> 37:13.673
Yeah. Well,
that was the deal.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.800
That was the switch
we made for my tickets.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.218
Oh.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.180
How was the concert?

38:13.441 --> 38:14.651
I've got it!

38:17.946 --> 38:19.823
I'll take that, thank you.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.920
Well, now, ain't that something?

38:34.295 --> 38:36.297
That's a sacred relic, Morgan.

38:36.673 --> 38:40.176
You keep that, you'll be
doomed for all eternity.

38:40.343 --> 38:41.886
I'll take me chances.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.429
How did you find us?

38:43.555 --> 38:46.182
I got the location of the
wreck out of your computer.

38:46.266 --> 38:47.600
You can work a computer?

38:47.684 --> 38:51.688
No, but Maitland can if you
put a gun in his back.

38:52.105 --> 38:55.275
All right, all of
you, face down on the deck.

38:55.859 --> 38:57.944
- Move it!
- You're gonna kill us?

38:57.986 --> 38:59.487
You and the girl, maybe.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.824
But the others are worth a lot
more alive, being the A-Team.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.035
And you got the cross, and you
want a reward on top of that?

39:06.202 --> 39:09.664
Gotta live on something before we can
bust this thing up and fence it.

39:09.831 --> 39:12.333
I radioed the army, Captain.
They'll be waiting at the dock.

39:12.417 --> 39:15.170
Good. After you've
delivered them...

39:15.628 --> 39:17.589
meet us back
at the salvage yard.

41:11.619 --> 41:12.912
You okay, Colonel?

41:13.204 --> 41:15.540
That bird will eat anything.

42:08.718 --> 42:09.844
Come on!

42:11.888 --> 42:15.266
Well, she doesn't look that
great coming out of the shower.

42:16.059 --> 42:18.686
I really don't know
what you see in her.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.024
Right.

43:25.128 --> 43:28.923
Melted down, the gold alone ought
to be worth over half a million.

43:29.132 --> 43:31.175
On top of that, the jewels.

44:28.774 --> 44:30.985
This belongs
to somebody else, pal.

44:44.957 --> 44:46.876
I had to grab this limo from
the secretary of the army...

44:46.918 --> 44:48.419
so I want this
to go down smooth.

44:48.586 --> 44:50.171
From the time
Peck gets in this limo...

44:50.338 --> 44:53.174
we need 15 minutes before we get to
the ambush spot, do you understand?

44:53.382 --> 44:54.800
15 minutes?

44:54.884 --> 44:57.637
How am I supposed to keep him
occupied for 15 minutes?

44:57.762 --> 45:01.057
Just do anything you gotta do, baby.
It's a big reward.

45:15.821 --> 45:18.324
Templeton, I am so sorry.

45:18.407 --> 45:20.910
I knew they made you do it.

45:21.035 --> 45:23.162
I just knew it.

45:23.454 --> 45:27.416
And, Rebecca, I want you
to know that I understand.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.086
- Okay?
- Well, it's all over now.

45:30.211 --> 45:32.713
And we've got a lot
of catching up to do.

45:33.214 --> 45:35.800
Yeah. There's champagne
in the limo.

45:36.884 --> 45:38.594
- Okay?
- Yeah...

45:58.531 --> 45:59.907
Here we are.

46:02.660 --> 46:05.162
No, I think... I feel
really funny about this.

46:05.412 --> 46:07.158
I think you should drop me off.

46:07.183 --> 46:10.126
- Driver--
- No, no, Templeton. No.

46:10.668 --> 46:12.253
I wanna be alone with you.

46:12.991 --> 46:14.624
- Yeah.
- Really, I do.

46:20.636 --> 46:22.888
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

46:43.034 --> 46:44.744
Was it worth the wait?

46:45.369 --> 46:48.831
More than you can
possibly imagine.

46:50.833 --> 46:53.753
- I gotta tell you something.
- Hmm.

46:54.337 --> 46:56.172
You're still a minor leaguer.

47:05.681 --> 47:08.893
No reward this time, sweetheart.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.528
How was the ride, Lieutenant?

47:19.653 --> 47:23.616
Well, it's nothing worth writing
the alumni newsletter about.
