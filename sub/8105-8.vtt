00:00.084 --> 00:02.877
Welcome to
the world of illusion!

00:03.045 --> 00:05.797
What is real
and what is magic?

00:05.923 --> 00:07.799
This is what you will wonder

00:07.925 --> 00:11.386
as I perform feats
that will astound you!

00:11.679 --> 00:14.138
As you see,
there is nothing up my sleeve.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.141
And this hat,
it's just an ordinary old hat.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.436
Watch, as I wave
three times above the hat,

00:20.646 --> 00:24.023
and whisper the magic words.
And now...

00:27.236 --> 00:29.779
Mom, it's not working!
It's ripped!

00:29.905 --> 00:31.489
It's okay, baby,
it's just a little tear.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.325
- Hurry up, Mom!
- What are you so worried about?

00:34.451 --> 00:37.453
- Sally's gonna make fun of us.
- Sally Ayerson?

00:38.205 --> 00:42.250
She said her mom bought her
dress at Bloomingdale's
and you had to make ours.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.168
We're gonna look stupid.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.797
Do you girls remember
that music we were
listening to yesterday?

00:47.923 --> 00:50.258
- That lady who sang about respect?
- Reetha?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.926
Aretha, that's right.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.178
Do you think she
had lots of money
growing up in Detroit?

00:54.304 --> 00:56.180
- What's Detroit?
- It's a city.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.726
The point is, is that she's
one of the best singers ever.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.728
If Sally's mean to you again,

01:01.854 --> 01:04.272
I'm just gonna have
to key her daddy's
new convertible.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.607
Great. And thank you!

01:06.734 --> 01:08.484
Do you know
what that means?

01:09.111 --> 01:10.111
Good.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

01:28.297 --> 01:31.048
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa

01:31.175 --> 01:36.637
Little-bitty, pretty one
Come on and talk to me

01:36.847 --> 01:42.268
Lovey-dovey, dovey one
Come on sit down on my knee

01:43.270 --> 01:46.230
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa

02:34.279 --> 02:35.112
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.532
You speak to
Chase and House yet?
The disciplinary hearing.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.450
The McGinley case,
that's not for two weeks.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.701
Tomorrow.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.161
Scheduling disaster,
you don't wanna hear it.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.871
You gotta get the boys' okay
to move the hearing up,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.040
and you gotta do that
whole legal advice thing.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.501
- Can you ask someone else?
- I'm asking you.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.088
Let me work with Chase.
House should have separate counsel.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.006
Stop looking for
whatever you're looking for.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.217
For the last month,
House has been crowing

02:56.343 --> 02:59.136
that you can't work with him because
you're just swooning in love.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.390
There is nothing approaching love
in what I feel about him right now.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.893
Well,
if you can't work with him,
it amounts to the same thing.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.522
We had a fight. It's awkward.
Why not use another lawyer?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.650
Because 40% of our
lawsuits last year
were about House.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.653
If you can't work with him,
you can't work here.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.947
She's overreacting.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.951
You snuck into
her shrink's office
and read her private file.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.078
When Nixon did that,
he got impeached.

03:24.204 --> 03:28.124
So you're saying I'm not
allowed to have oral sex
with an intern, either?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.835
Yes! And yes.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.881
That file got me on the floor of her
attic with her pouring out her soul.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.592
The only thing I did
wrong was get caught.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.720
Where's Chase?

03:41.179 --> 03:44.223
He's too busy to service you
until after work.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.726
I got a couple minutes,
though.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.561
Feel free to say
something like,

03:48.687 --> 03:50.855
"What'll we do
with the time left over?"

03:51.315 --> 03:53.649
Or you could just stew,
that works as well.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.443
She stews before
she gets violent.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.195
This one says you're okay
with moving the disciplinary
hearing to tomorrow.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.240
This one says I've advised
you of your legal rights.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.660
- Any legal rights I should know about?
- Nope.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.622
Great.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.625
And you thought
this was gonna be awkward.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.752
You shouldn't sign it.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.712
Postponing is almost always
the smart thing to do.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.089
Tempers cool, memories fade.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.258
They rule on me,
it's done, right?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.677
- Yeah, but...
- Then let's get it over with.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.555
- Ever done a peer review before?
- No.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.723
Good.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.768
Peer's a misnomer.
These are your bosses.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.687
This could cost you
some money, some privileges

04:31.813 --> 04:33.940
or it could cost
you your career.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.067
All I can tell them is
what happened.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.777
There is an objective reality
to what happened,

04:37.903 --> 04:40.112
and that committee is
never gonna know it.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.323
All they're gonna know is
what they picture happened,

04:42.449 --> 04:45.785
which depends a little on what
you tell them and a whole lot

04:46.662 --> 04:48.079
on how you tell them.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.498
May 11.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.001
- The patient presented to the clinic.
- What's her name?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.253
- It's in the file.
- Do you know it?

04:56.505 --> 04:57.713
Then use it.

04:58.799 --> 05:03.052
Kayla presented to the clinic with
multiple joint and stomach pain.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.097
Dr. Foreman was called in
for a neurological consult.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.598
What's the point
of this, man?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.142
Checking your sister's
cerebral coordination.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.645
The thing is in her leg
and her stomach.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.065
Wait in the clinic for
six hours so she can play
patty cake?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.859
You could have gone
to the ER last night.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.696
You gonna come over
and baby-sit her kids?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.615
Okay. Patient comes from
a family of jerks, I get it.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.617
Can you stick
to the medicine?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.703
Something wrong?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.122
- There was some uveitis.
- Meaning?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.250
Her iris,
the colored part of her eye,
was inflamed.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.961
- Meaning?
- Worst case, blindness.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.672
But there was an upside.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.008
It was weird enough
to get House interested.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.094
Young woman, joint pain,
gonorrhea's a possibility.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.763
It's polyarticular.
Maybe rheumatoid.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.765
That's typically small joints,
this hit her knee.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.684
Takayasu's arteritis.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.479
Get a sed rate
and serologies.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.357
"Childproof."

05:58.525 --> 06:00.401
How many kids are
hopped up on Vicodin?

06:00.610 --> 06:03.779
- Give me.
- Right. Like I'd ever get it back.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.531
Chase?

06:05.657 --> 06:08.075
Don't care about the Vicodin.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.911
Might not just be her arteries,
could be all her blood vessels.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.706
Vasculitis,
with stomach pains,
so Behcet's.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.500
- No, she'd have oral sores.
- Or genital.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.544
Go find them.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.507
I thought she was
Foreman's patient.
Why did you do the exam?

06:24.259 --> 06:26.802
- She'd have oral sores.
- Or genital.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.471
Go find them.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.520
Whoa, whoa, Foreman.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.898
Chase can handle the pelvic.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.068
Any pain?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.236
Is it bad?

06:45.739 --> 06:48.407
This would go a lot easier
if you talked to me.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.368
I'm sorry.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.788
I, um...

06:54.664 --> 06:56.457
I just really hate hospitals.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.043
When I was 12,
I had my tonsils out.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.254
Got to skip school, lots of ice cream,
made me wanna be a doctor.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.758
My mom died when I was eight,

07:06.802 --> 07:09.637
so I spent months
at Princeton General.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.850
She died of DTs, your mom?

07:15.727 --> 07:18.646
Bottles stashed around the house?
Mood swings? That whole deal?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.856
- You've been there?
- My mom.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.193
Dad left,
Mom crawled inside a bottle.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.529
Made for a great
year 12 of high school.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.365
You okay with your dad now?

07:30.534 --> 07:31.534
No.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.329
Does your dad have anything
to do with this story?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.789
No, it's just...

07:36.915 --> 07:39.917
Okay, I get it, the two of you
bonded, which is probably
why you haven't been sued.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.794
Patients never sue
doctors they like.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.296
But keep it brief, okay?
The panel doesn't
like to think

07:44.422 --> 07:47.258
they're being manipulated
when they're
being manipulated.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.884
She had some ulceration.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.845
Confirming Behcet's.

07:50.971 --> 07:55.391
I gave her some prednisone,
an antacid, and I ran
a pathergy test on her arm.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.476
Takes 24 hours to confirm.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.353
Told her any doctor
could check it out.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.647
- You didn't make an appointment.
- Nope.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.065
She just showed up.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.611
- Dr. Chase?
- Hi.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.781
All right,
let's take a look.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.787
Okay, those little pustules
mean it's positive.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.791
Talk to Nurse Preven,
get an appointment with
Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.794
Behcet's is very treatable,
you're gonna be fine.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.796
Okay. Thanks.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.049
And you were just chatting
on the phone with someone

08:29.176 --> 08:30.676
and she happened
to run into you.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.635
That's what happened.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.013
No appointment,
no real examination?

08:34.139 --> 08:35.681
Just gave her
the test results.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.017
So, lower standard of care,

08:38.143 --> 08:40.686
you really couldn't
be expected to notice
there was anything else wrong.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.022
We didn't even go
into an exam room.

08:47.819 --> 08:52.198
As your lawyer,
I can't stop you from lying,
I can't even be in the room.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.492
But I would be remiss
if I didn't prep you
to lie better.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.581
You wrote her a prescription,
which means
there was an examination.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.082
What really happened?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.335
I was on the phone.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.049
Dr. Chase? Hi.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.759
Hi.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.595
Kayla. I'm here
for the test. My arm.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.597
Oh, yeah.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.599
Okay.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.517
It's positive.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.688
Talk to Nurse Preven,
get an appointment with
Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

09:25.941 --> 09:29.735
I took that medicine
you gave me,
but my stomach still hurts.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.698
Behcet's could be
stronger than we thought,

09:34.824 --> 09:37.576
or it could be reflux
from the prednisone.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.496
Here's a stronger antacid.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.666
- Doctor?
- Yes?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.086
Nothing.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.007
You didn't ask her anything
about the stomach pain?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.386
I made one little mistake.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.389
As little mistakes go,
that was a biggie.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.938
She's only advising Chase?
Not you?

10:06.147 --> 10:09.108
Well, what's
the committee gonna do to me?
I never even met this patient.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.818
Your disdain for
human interaction

10:10.944 --> 10:12.945
doesn't exculpate you,
it inculpates you.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.489
You signed the charts,
you're responsible
for everything Chase does.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.074
Which is why
this doesn't matter.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.784
She protects Chase,
she protects me.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.621
Unless her advice
to Chase is to make a deal
and give you up.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.042
"I'm so sorry,
if only Dr. House
had paid attention.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.962
He never even met her,
he never does."

10:30.213 --> 10:32.423
Chase loves me.
And isn't Turkish.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.426
Cameron loves you,
Chase loves his job.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.678
You really think
Stacy hates me that much?

10:37.804 --> 10:40.973
I think right now
she hates you
more than enough.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.393
You think emotion
only affects
doctors' judgments?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.482
Everything stemmed
from that one interaction.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.734
They're gonna
slam you on it.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.112
Were you distracted?
Your problem. Overworked?
That's their problem.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.363
Forgeftul, yours, lazy...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.365
I just figured
the stomach pain
was the Behcet's.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.742
Any doctor would have
thought the same.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.203
Then why did you
call her an hour
after she left the clinic?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.081
Nurse Preven said
you asked her to have
Kayla come back in.

11:06.207 --> 11:10.085
The way she hesitated,
I thought she might have had
a doorknob question.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.296
Patient comes in,

11:12.422 --> 11:15.299
says he's got a sniffly nose,
you examine him for
10 minutes, right?

11:15.425 --> 11:16.967
Then you're leaving,
hand on the doorknob,

11:17.093 --> 11:20.429
and he says, "Oh, yeah,
and my penis
has turned green".

11:20.555 --> 11:22.848
Embarrassing question,
the only important one,
patient saves it for last.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.518
So you knew she was
about to ask
the most important question

11:26.728 --> 11:27.853
and you left.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.773
No, I didn't.
I figured it out later.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.149
What changed?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.360
- Nothing.
- Bad answer.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.321
- I wasn't thinking clearly at first.
- Worse answer.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.115
So what was her
doorknob question?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.701
I figured it might be
blood in her stool,

11:43.161 --> 11:45.537
which could indicate
a bleeding ulcer.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.580
Talk to me.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.832
Thirty-five year old female,
vomiting massive
amounts of blood,

11:48.958 --> 11:52.044
LOC at work, BP 80
over 20, heart rate 140.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.003
You push fluids?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.589
Three liters in the field,
and we're bolusing
another one right now.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.216
It's gotta be
a bleeding ulcer, Doc.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.469
Her coworkers said
she's been eating
ibuprofens like candy.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.429
I thought
she had Behcet's!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.848
One, two, three.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.574
I'm in the stomach.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.284
There's too much blood,
I can't see.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.578
- Did she burst an artery?
- No.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.997
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.124
Cauterizing.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.668
- I can't see, use some more saline.
- Hold on.

12:32.794 --> 12:33.794
Okay.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.590
Looks good.
Bleeding ulcer. We got it.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.467
She was fine two hours ago.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.261
Systolic BP 70.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.555
Where's the ulcer?
It's brown, I cauterized it.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.223
There must be
something else.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.349
There.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.644
- A second ulcer?
- Not anymore. It perforated.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.646
Get her to an OR!

12:52.939 --> 12:55.691
The surgeons were able to
suture the perforation.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.610
But the contents
of the patient's,

12:58.820 --> 13:01.780
Kayla's, stomach had
spilled into her body.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.615
She got septic.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.826
Then the infection
lowers her blood pressure...

13:05.952 --> 13:07.661
Fifty over palp
at one point.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.038
It damaged her liver
and kidneys.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.625
Listen, I know
this looks bad.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.502
I obviously got
the diagnosis wrong,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.421
but I did everything
by the book.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.965
I couldn't have known
what was gonna happen.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.552
If I skip my coffee,
I get cranky.
Do you want anything?

13:32.437 --> 13:34.521
Why did Chase screw up?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.483
He forgot to ask a question,
does there need
to be a reason?

13:37.609 --> 13:38.817
It might help him.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.154
As far as I'm concerned,
he made a little mistake.
It happens.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.363
How far are you concerned?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.282
You think I'm biased?

13:45.450 --> 13:48.410
You're colleagues.
You worked together
for over a year.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.579
And everyone says
you slept together.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.498
Who says?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.917
The correct answer is,
"We're not involved
and I'm not biased".

13:55.043 --> 13:58.045
We're not involved,
and I don't know
why he messed up.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.298
House has worked with him
longer than I have.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.050
You should talk to House.

14:04.719 --> 14:05.844
Yeah.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.180
Why did Chase screw up?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.724
Because he doesn't give
a crap about patients.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.476
Well, he always gets
positive patient reviews.

14:12.602 --> 14:15.103
Yeah. He smiles
all 84 of his teeth,

14:15.230 --> 14:16.522
tells them
his tonsil story...

14:16.648 --> 14:19.316
- It's a nice story.
- He still has his tonsils!

14:19.442 --> 14:22.528
As soon as he's out
of the room, which is as soon
as he can be out of the room,

14:22.654 --> 14:24.363
he starts in on
the trash talking.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.823
He thinks not giving a crap
makes him like House.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.034
Like it's something
to aspire to.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.578
Am I gonna have to testify?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.206
I won't be
encouraging them
to call you.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.499
What did House say?

14:41.381 --> 14:45.467
- Two months like this.
- Let me guess, no insurance.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.512
You've just heard
about the free clinic.
It's a good move.

14:48.638 --> 14:52.975
You don't wanna skimp
on the essentials like
wristwatches, MP3 players.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.143
I need to talk to you.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.312
- From the doorway?
- It's confidential.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.273
Cool. I love gossip.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.527
You hear that
crackling sound?

15:03.695 --> 15:05.487
Like crumpling up paper?

15:05.613 --> 15:08.574
Keep listening,
let me know if it changes.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.585
Two questions.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.296
Why did Chase screw up,
and how bad was it?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.424
Wow. Talk about efficient,
I only need one answer.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.676
- Chase didn't screw up.
- He said he did.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.637
Well, I'm not a lawyer,
but that seems like
a sucky legal strategy.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.557
They're gonna wanna know
what you think a reasonable
doctor would have done

15:33.683 --> 15:34.641
in Chase's position.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.102
If I thought he was
a reasonable doctor,
I wouldn't have hired him.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.854
God, you two are
a couple of geniuses.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.107
Deny everything,
completely fool the lawyer
who's trying to help you.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.485
Too bad the review
committee members
are actually doctors.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.362
Stacy.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.409
I'm in the stomach.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.536
There's too much blood,
I can't see.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.413
- Did she burst an artery?
- No.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.416
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.419
Okay. Cauterizing.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.881
- Looks good.
- Bleeding ulcer. We got it.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.507
She was fine two hours ago.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.260
If by "fine", you mean
she had fountains of blood

16:10.386 --> 16:13.305
spurting out of every orifice,
then yeah, I believe you.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.892
I'm guessing those are
celebratory bells.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.435
Systolic BP 70.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.478
Show me the ulcer.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.896
It's brown,
I cauterized it.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.357
Sweep back.
Show me the whole stomach.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.276
Stop.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.238
- A second ulcer?
- Not anymore. It perforated.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.366
Get her to an OR!

16:33.451 --> 16:34.451
Let's go.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.790
She was not "fine"
two hours ago.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.793
- Did she mention stomach pain?
- Yeah, so I gave her a stronger...

16:42.919 --> 16:45.629
- You didn't do an exam.
- She just came in for a follow-up.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.381
The results of
the pathergy test...

16:47.507 --> 16:48.965
Did you listen
to her stomach?

16:49.092 --> 16:50.050
Check her vitals?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.427
Maybe if she'd said
something about
taking ibuprofen,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.429
- mentioned the rectal bleeding...
- Yeah!

16:54.555 --> 16:56.848
Why didn't she go to
med school like you did?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.768
Diarrhea, blood in the stool,
these are routine questions!

16:59.894 --> 17:01.228
That doctors
skip all the time!

17:01.354 --> 17:03.605
It was a minor mistake,
I couldn't have known
this was gonna happen...

17:03.731 --> 17:05.941
Mistakes are as serious
as the results they cause!

17:06.067 --> 17:08.985
This woman could die
because you were too lazy
to ask one simple question!

17:09.112 --> 17:10.946
No, she might die
because I had

17:11.114 --> 17:12.989
the bad luck to spill
your damn Vicodin pills!

17:13.116 --> 17:15.909
I responded
with a number of
trenchant remarks

17:16.035 --> 17:18.829
which made Chase cry,
none of which
I'm gonna testify about.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.331
Unless you convince
Chase to roll on me.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.502
Excuse me.
Testify about what?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.006
Chuck.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.467
I'm gonna break
from the parable
of the wicked doctor

17:32.593 --> 17:36.972
and tell a little
story about a patient,
let's call him Buck.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.475
Who has low O2 sats
and crackling lung sounds.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.435
Like I have.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.813
Buck has idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.274
His lung tissue's
turning to rock.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.609
There's no known cause,
no treatment.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.320
- He is slowly suffocating.
- You're talking about me?

17:52.447 --> 17:55.115
Lung transplant's
about $500,000,

17:55.241 --> 17:56.742
but this poor sucker's
got no insurance.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.287
If he tried to sign up now,
he'd be excluded,
preexisting condition.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.539
But let me confirm
with my lawyer.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.458
She confirms.

18:05.251 --> 18:09.546
If only Buck hadn't been
diagnosed with fibrosis
before he got insurance.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.340
So, back to the exam.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.562
That's how you tell
this guy he's dying?

18:25.688 --> 18:27.647
Oh, relax. He's got a cold.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.608
And soon, health insurance.

18:30.401 --> 18:33.278
Such a hero,
always righting wrongs.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.197
Who cares who
you have to manipulate?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.490
I'm sorry.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.201
I didn't realize
you and Buck were so close.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.748
- It's a point of principle.
- Right.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.416
It's got nothing to do
with what I did to you.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.376
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.086
That's why
you're following me.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.088
- I read some notes.
- If Chase screwed up...

18:52.215 --> 18:55.467
I was wrong!
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.803
If Chase screwed up so badly,
why didn't you fire him?

18:57.929 --> 18:59.387
He has great hair.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.891
- What are you hiding?
- I'm gay.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.103
Oh, that's not what you meant.
It does explain a lot, though.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.523
No girlfriend,
always with Wilson.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.733
Obsession with sneakers.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.903
Diarrhea, blood in the stool.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.822
Two simple questions
you could have asked
her six months ago

19:16.948 --> 19:20.492
and averted this whole thing.
You didn't ask either, why?

19:21.452 --> 19:24.454
Judging from your question
and your demeanor,

19:24.705 --> 19:27.082
I assume you were
visiting with House.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.459
We've been over this.
I don't know.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.752
Good doctors don't
make mistakes like that.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.712
Good doctors never forget
to ask questions?

19:32.839 --> 19:35.090
Then you've got your answer,
apparently,
I'm not a good doctor.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.009
FYI, self-pity generally
is not a good strategy
in these hearings.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.262
What happened
after the operation?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.598
The kidney damage
isn't so bad.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.475
The liver damage
is more worrisome.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.561
There's no dialysis
for livers.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.856
I know.
But if she loses a liver,
she can get a transplant, right?

19:50.982 --> 19:52.732
We can put her on a list.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.985
I could do it.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.987
I could give her
part of my liver.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.030
Surgeons won't operate
unless the donor's

19:59.198 --> 20:01.157
had a long time to
weigh the decision.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.409
There's black markets.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.535
For organs?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.662
That's just...

20:05.788 --> 20:07.581
Oh, my stomach!

20:07.707 --> 20:09.666
- The pain constant?
- Yeah!

20:09.792 --> 20:12.002
- Sharp or dull?
- I don't know!

20:12.128 --> 20:14.588
- It's ferric.
- It's a little cold.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.591
- She's got ascites.
- No. It's a clot.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.636
Nurse! Call the OR. We gotta
prep her for an embolectomy.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.682
Run CBC, PT,
and a liver panel.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.227
Sepsis had lowered
her BP so much, she got
clots in her liver.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.730
They blocked
the hepatic artery,
cut off the blood flow.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.231
Her liver was shocked.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.109
And Cuddy listed her?
With all the other problems?

20:37.486 --> 20:41.197
Forget it!
We can't give a liver
to a woman this sick.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.490
Do you listen to
what you're saying?

20:42.617 --> 20:46.536
There is no point in giving
a new liver to somebody
who also has vasculitis.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.788
- Treatable.
- And kidney damage.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.499
- It's healing.
- You know what's really killing her?

20:51.626 --> 20:54.711
Chase forgot to ask
a standard question
about stomach pain.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.130
So he missed the diagnosis,
so she perforated,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.549
so she got sepsis,
so her BP tanked,

20:59.717 --> 21:01.885
so she got blood clots,
so she lost her liver.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.764
Livers are important, Cuddy.
You can't live without them,
hence the name.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.015
Here's the big issue.

21:07.141 --> 21:10.852
Chase is a hospital employee,
and Kayla is
a sympathetic mother

21:10.978 --> 21:14.147
of those two
jury-friendly moppets,
Caleb and Cody.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.607
Dory and Nikki.

21:15.733 --> 21:19.527
Your point, beyond
just trying to make
Chase wet himself,

21:19.654 --> 21:23.448
seems to be that
the hospital faces
liability here.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.367
Well, thanks for
clearing that up.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.202
I still need
a medical reason
to list her.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.162
That is the medical reason.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.583
If the family wins
this hospital in a lawsuit,
they'll turn it into condos.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.128
And people will die
waiting outside a condo
for medical care.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.470
Start praying
for a 12-car pileup
on the turnpike,

21:45.596 --> 21:48.598
'cause we're not exactly
swimming in livers over here.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.108
When you're testifying,
skip the details on
how House convinced Cuddy.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.111
I don't think the people
who got bumped down the transplant
list need to know why.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.320
It didn't matter anyway.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.823
- She next on the list?
- Yes.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.993
But she's AB negative,
very rare.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.122
How long can she
go on like this?

22:12.415 --> 22:14.207
Probably another day or two.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.087
- I'm donating my liver.
- Sam, we talked about this.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.215
I'm a perfect match,
six out of six HLA proteins.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.134
How'd you get
checked out so fast?

22:24.260 --> 22:26.553
I know a guy in
medical testing,
and I paid him to rush it.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.597
- Sam bribed someone to rush his tests?
- Wouldn't you?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.516
Someone's going to get
the blame for what happened,

22:31.642 --> 22:34.102
so the more we
spread it around,
we might as well...

22:34.228 --> 22:38.148
You said no surgeon would do
a live donor transplant
on such short notice.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.442
House took care of that, too.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.488
Your patient's
hardly clotting.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.367
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh
frozen plasma pre-op.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.577
Pretty risky.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.079
Well, that's why I came
to the best transplant
surgeon in the hospital.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.956
She's dead without you.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.793
Get her in this afternoon.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.839
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.759
And this was right
before you ran the marathon,
I suppose?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.803
Was it the part
where he warmly clasped
my hands in thanks,

23:08.929 --> 23:11.014
- was that too much?
- What did you do to him?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.767
The hospital lawyer asks me
if I did something unethical?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.144
If I did,
the last person I'd tell
is the hospital lawyer,

23:16.270 --> 23:18.897
especially since she's gone
all Old Testament on me.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.941
- You'll tell me.
- Oh. Okay then.

23:22.485 --> 23:26.738
One caveat,
I've moved past threesomes,
I'm now into foursomes.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.616
If someone backs out, then,
you've still got a threesome.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.118
And if two people back out,
you're still having sex.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.703
You'd be amazed,
even if three people...

23:33.829 --> 23:35.705
Anything you say
is attorney-client.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.041
So you can get advice
about the bad,
bad thing you did,

23:38.167 --> 23:41.086
knowing I'll be tortured
because I can't tell a soul.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.339
Actually,
it is kind of cool.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.134
Are you completely
out of your mind?

23:48.636 --> 23:50.053
She's dying on her own,

23:50.179 --> 23:52.806
why would I volunteer
to be her executioner?

23:53.099 --> 23:56.684
And I'd just be inviting
a lawsuit from the brother
no matter what.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.145
5 grand.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.733
And that's just ante money.
After the surgery,
you get another 15.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.152
Though I warn you,
that includes the tip.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.115
I make 600 grand a year.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.785
You think I'm gonna risk
tanking my percentages
for $20,000?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.411
It's tax-free.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.122
For the record,

24:17.248 --> 24:19.207
I hope the Department
takes you and Chase

24:19.333 --> 24:22.293
and drop-kicks
both your asses
out the back door.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.170
Great!

24:25.089 --> 24:27.549
That means
I don't have to bother
welshing on the 15 grand

24:27.675 --> 24:29.217
I would have owed you.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.929
If you don't do the surgery,
I'm gonna tell your wife

24:33.055 --> 24:35.807
that you've been sleeping
with a series of nurses.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.935
Currently Nurse Cutler
in Radiology.

24:39.562 --> 24:42.147
Now, what's 600 grand
divided by two?

24:42.940 --> 24:44.274
Last Christmas party,

24:44.400 --> 24:47.318
Nurse Cutler handed you
one of those little hot dogs.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.529
And you didn't thank her.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.199
Well, that only happens
when you're very,
very intimate.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.161
That, and the fact
that you've been
practically dancing around

24:56.287 --> 24:59.998
with your zipper open,
and a used condom
stuck on your shoe.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.250
Your wife is apparently
the only one who doesn't know.

25:02.376 --> 25:03.793
There's no way
you'll tell her.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.963
Of course I won't.
I'm much too cowardly.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.257
No, I'll just send
an anonymous letter.

25:09.383 --> 25:13.469
Now, I've got an OR booked
for 4:00 this afternoon.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.597
Are you free?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.978
Oh, and "for the record",

25:22.104 --> 25:25.190
you are the worst
transplant surgeon
in this hospital.

25:25.316 --> 25:29.402
But unfortunately, you're
the only one who's currently
cheating on his wife.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.620
You bribed him
and then you blackmailed him?

25:38.746 --> 25:41.706
She'd have been dead
in two days if I hadn't made
Ayersman do the surgery.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.083
Leave the blackmail
out of the story
you tell the committee.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.085
I tried to leave it out
of the story I told you.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.838
And then there was
that incident
in the parking lot.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.299
- Don't do that!
- Hey, what, are you nuts?

25:51.675 --> 25:53.134
No, please,
I didn't do it!

25:53.260 --> 25:55.970
- I didn't do anything! Please!
- No!

25:56.096 --> 25:58.890
Apparently,
someone sent an anonymous
letter to his wife.

25:59.016 --> 26:02.936
You blackmailed Ayersman,
he performed the surgery,
and you ratted him out anyway?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.145
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.064
You just can't
control yourself, can you?

26:06.190 --> 26:08.066
No matter how stupid,
how self-destructive...

26:08.192 --> 26:11.027
To make this
conversation easier,
can we discard the fiction

26:11.153 --> 26:14.530
that we're talking about
anything other than
what I did to you?

26:14.657 --> 26:17.325
You're not mad because
I broke into your
psychiatrist's office.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.660
Yeah, I was
thrilled about that.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.078
Okay, it was
a lousy thing to do.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.162
But if what I had found

26:21.288 --> 26:23.456
was that everything was
all kittens and moonbeams
in Markville,

26:23.582 --> 26:25.959
- you'd be over it.
- No, I wouldn't!

26:26.085 --> 26:28.503
You're mad at me
for letting you
know what I did.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.964
Because you liked
where things were going.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.760
And for that,
I actually am sorry.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.470
It was stupid.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.984
Let me tell you
a story about a patient.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.529
A patient we'll call Fusan.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.907
Because Sam had
rushed his tests,

26:58.033 --> 27:01.077
we were able to
get them into surgery
that afternoon.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.081
Dr. Ayersman performed
the live-donor transplant.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.042
He resected the right lobe,
hepatic vein,

27:08.210 --> 27:10.211
and hepatic artery
of Sam's liver,

27:10.337 --> 27:12.297
and transplanted it
into Kayla.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.173
The operation was a success.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.760
Kayla and Sam continued
to receive routine care.

27:19.013 --> 27:22.682
Two months later,
she came by for an exam.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.102
July 24, be precise.
You did the exam?

27:26.228 --> 27:27.687
Honestly, I just wanted...
"Honestly"?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.105
So you've been
lying up until now?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.482
Let's make a deal.
I won't use the word "honestly",

27:31.608 --> 27:33.151
and you'll quit
stopping by to see House

27:33.319 --> 27:36.404
so you don't take it out
on me afterwards. How about that?

27:38.490 --> 27:41.284
I wanted to be as far away
from Kayla as possible.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.494
And House was
rubbing my nose in it.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.163
How are the girls?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.706
They're great.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.209
Dory had her first crush,
which was cute.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.294
Oh, yeah?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.504
And then her
first sort of breakup,

27:53.630 --> 27:55.340
which was not so cute.

27:57.968 --> 28:01.220
You're hot. 99.3.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.348
- Have you been coughing?
- No.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.475
- Pain in urinating?
- No.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.271
99's not that high, is it?

28:10.814 --> 28:13.941
Immunosuppressants block fevers,
you shouldn't have one at all.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.654
I'm sending a nurse in here
to draw cultures.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.782
And I'm ordering
a chest x-ray.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.909
I wasn't making
any more mistakes.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.994
Another phrase to avoid
in front of the committee.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.163
She spiked a fever
an hour later.

28:27.289 --> 28:30.958
Her AST and ALT are up.
She's rejecting the liver.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.794
No, it's just an infection.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.754
One of her cultures
is growing out strep.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.172
Just one?
Probably a contaminant.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.966
She's dehydrated,
her hematocrit's way up.
It's strep.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.510
Her transaminases
are up, too.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.720
- That's just stress from the strep.
- Jeez, Chase.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.931
You and this strep.
Get a room already.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.933
She's not rejecting
the liver.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.269
It's just an infection,
she'll be fine.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.021
Worst case,
we could re-list her.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.398
You House?

28:53.565 --> 28:57.860
Well, that depends.
Are you gonna hit Dr. House?

28:58.987 --> 29:01.531
You haven't even seen
my sister, and you're being
cute with me?

29:01.657 --> 29:04.117
Sam, we're talking
about her right now.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.285
- Her fever might...
- Could be hep B, hep C, right?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.997
This is treatable.
You give her interferon,
she's okay, right?

29:10.124 --> 29:11.749
You know a lot
about hepatitis.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.043
He just donated his liver.

29:15.045 --> 29:18.172
- You're flushed. You sick?
- I'm tired.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.258
You're hiding the fact
that you're sick.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.969
- Now, why would you do that?
- Hey, what are you...

29:23.095 --> 29:24.762
Now, either you
specifically asked

29:24.888 --> 29:27.432
for a tattoo of a heart
that's been left out
in the sun too long,

29:27.558 --> 29:29.684
or that is
a really bad home job.

29:29.810 --> 29:33.187
It's a very common
way of getting hep C.
Which you have.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.231
And you've had it
a long time.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.279
It was gonna keep me
from giving my liver.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.489
You paid off that lab tech
to say you were clean?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.950
It hasn't been active
in years, she was
gonna die if I didn't.

29:46.076 --> 29:49.162
You paid someone off?
That is totally unethical!

29:50.038 --> 29:52.832
Get an MRI for him
and his sister, right now.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.710
She got hep from me,
didn't she?

29:55.836 --> 29:58.337
No! No, no, no, no.
God, no.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.965
I think she got
cancer from you.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.055
House was right?

30:08.182 --> 30:10.266
The brother had
an undiagnosed hepatoma

30:10.392 --> 30:12.351
that was transplanted
with his liver.

30:12.478 --> 30:16.105
It grew a lot faster
in Kayla because she was
immunosuppressed.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.815
How could House
have known?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.067
Hepatitis can cause
liver cancer.

30:20.194 --> 30:23.654
Plus, her hematocrit,
red blood cell count,
was high.

30:23.780 --> 30:28.868
Usually means dehydration.
Rare cases, cancer.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.288
It probably saved
Sam's life.

30:32.456 --> 30:36.667
We were able to
operate on him early enough,
before it metastasized.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.377
O2 sats 94.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.007
Kayla had already
started rejecting the liver.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.260
- No re-listing because of the cancer.
- Nothing we could do.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.012
This is good.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.473
The brother lying
about his hep,
it's an intervening act.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.100
The proximate
cause of her cancer,
not your mistake.

30:53.227 --> 30:56.312
She would have died
six months ago if he hadn't
given up his liver.

30:56.438 --> 30:57.897
Maybe. Can't prove it.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.151
You need to come with me.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.986
Just been served with papers.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.655
Actually, paper.
One page.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.325
"Defendants
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital

31:09.451 --> 31:11.911
and Dr. Robert Chase.
Blah, blah, blah.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.956
Medical malpractice,
negligence. Blah, blah."

31:15.082 --> 31:16.332
You're surprised
they're suing?

31:16.625 --> 31:19.418
You think people
love Chase so much
they're gonna just forgo...

31:19.545 --> 31:22.964
Punitive damages
in the amount of
$10 million.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.800
Punitives? That means
they're alleging
gross negligence.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.677
Their lawyer's obviously
out of his mind.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.887
Larry Ruseckas,
he's not crazy.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.223
Oh, no.
I've been sued by him.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.226
You have been hiding things
and lying to me all day.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.019
I haven't lied
about anything.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.605
Except for the parts that
I admitted I was lying about.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.567
And I'm not the one
being sued. I feel funny.

31:43.277 --> 31:46.195
Well,
what haven't you told us?

31:56.873 --> 32:00.167
Before she checked out,
Sam found her a second liver.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.212
- She had cancer, how could she...
- Black market.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.007
There's a doctor
in Mexico City who was gonna
do the surgery.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.009
She's leaving
from JFK at 5:00.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.261
To meet some Mexican guy
in the back of a van

32:10.387 --> 32:11.762
with a pig's liver
and a hacksaw? This is nuts!

32:11.888 --> 32:13.264
You wanna
rat me out to House?

32:13.390 --> 32:15.850
He'll say if there's a chance
in a billion then go for it.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.351
This is not what she wants.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.186
She's being manipulated

32:19.313 --> 32:22.273
by a morally guilty brother
and a legally guiltier doctor.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.693
- You think she wants to die?
- She's dying either way.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.362
Chase!

32:29.156 --> 32:32.158
How many people you know
walking around with
a black market organ

32:32.284 --> 32:33.534
from a Third World
surgeon, huh?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.828
This isn't gonna be
your salvation.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.456
It's just one more thing
they'll pin on you.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.751
Go in there,
be the good guy.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.299
We need to talk.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.926
- No, there's no time.
- Two minutes.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.678
Kayla.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.181
I made a mistake.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.644
I wasn't as blunt
as I should have been
about your odds.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.854
I probably didn't
want to face them myself.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.814
Dr. Chase,
please don't do this.

33:03.940 --> 33:08.694
The stress of the travel,
the operation
and even then the cancer...

33:08.862 --> 33:11.572
- Kayla, we're going!
- My dad died.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.658
Lung cancer.

33:13.784 --> 33:15.868
I saw him a couple of months
before it happened.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.161
We never talked about it.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.246
I'm sorry your father died,
but it has nothing...

33:19.373 --> 33:21.248
He never even told me
he was sick.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.668
I wish he had.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.087
It would...

33:29.216 --> 33:31.926
You're gonna die. Alone.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.844
Thousands of miles
from your children.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.846
You don't wanna
do that to them.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.982
- Kayla...
- I'm sorry, Sam.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.654
Kayla, you can't give up.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.366
If you do this,

33:57.452 --> 33:59.120
if you go home,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.540
I killed you.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.128
No.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.758
You gave me
three months.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.637
You gave Dory and Nikki
three more months with me.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.267
And when they
found my cancer,

34:23.228 --> 34:24.437
they found yours.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.277
And I got to save
my baby brother.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.708
A week later,
Kayla died at home.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.461
Sam was furious.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.463
Gotta be why the big lawsuit.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.047
- Are you buying this?
- Of course not!

34:52.174 --> 34:54.300
There was no
illegal transplant,
there's no causation.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.260
He was ready to kill me.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.304
Maybe he's lying
to his lawyers.

34:58.472 --> 35:00.097
Or you're lying to us.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.309
Last Thursday he saw you
for post-op care.
If you hate your doctor,

35:03.435 --> 35:06.395
you find another doctor
before you find a lawyer.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.857
This guy didn't sue
Cameron or Foreman,
he didn't even sue House!

35:09.983 --> 35:11.400
There's something
personal here,

35:11.526 --> 35:14.403
something you don't
want us to know
before your hearing.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.657
The guy didn't hate you
before that meeting,
he hated you after.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.578
So, how's
everything else?

35:22.704 --> 35:24.497
- The girls?
- Oh, you know.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.374
A lot of crying,
some nightmares.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.587
We'll be okay, though.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.298
Good.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.384
Girls are not gonna be happy
about leaving town, though.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.304
They love that house,

35:41.097 --> 35:42.890
the yard, their friends.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.391
- You're moving?
- Yeah.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.228
Ever since the operation,
I've been on disability,

35:47.604 --> 35:49.313
and the mortgage...

35:51.149 --> 35:53.901
So, we're moving out of state,
somewhere cheaper.

35:54.528 --> 35:56.821
Anyways, thanks.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.743
I killed your sister.

36:04.371 --> 36:09.166
I misdiagnosed her ulcer.
It killed her.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.334
Shut up, man.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.337
She liked you, just...

36:13.463 --> 36:16.173
I was hung over
when she came back
to see me.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.343
I'd been up half
the night drinking,
had a headache,

36:19.469 --> 36:22.096
and I just wanted to
get the hell out of there.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.019
I couldn't care less
what your sister was saying
about her stomach pain.

36:43.118 --> 36:46.412
May I speak to my future
former employee?

36:47.914 --> 36:49.081
Great story.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.000
You think I'm lying?

36:51.126 --> 36:52.293
That's exactly
what I told him.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.961
I'm sure it is.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.047
But you lied to him.
You want him to sue you.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.883
I killed his sister.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.969
I ordered black coffee
this morning and got cream.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.514
- Everybody screws up.
- They didn't put poison in your coffee.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.391
I've seen you hung over.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.476
You weren't the day you blew
his sister's diagnosis.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.646
What does it matter why?
Is she less dead
if I have a good excuse?

37:12.772 --> 37:15.900
If I thought you'd screwed up
because you were drunk,
I would have fired you.

37:16.026 --> 37:19.069
- You knew?
- You were depressed and distracted.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.532
I assumed you'd
gotten a phone call
from your stepmom.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.202
This is Robert.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.465
What did he die of?

37:44.346 --> 37:45.888
That's impossible.

37:46.556 --> 37:50.434
I saw him two months ago.
If he had lung cancer,
he would have...

37:59.402 --> 38:00.694
Dr. Chase?

38:15.418 --> 38:18.420
Good news is,
both your parents
are dead now.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.339
So no reason to screw up this bad again.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.882
How'd you know?

38:22.008 --> 38:25.469
There's this interconnected
network of computers,

38:25.595 --> 38:27.221
or "Interweb",
where you can...

38:27.389 --> 38:29.056
How did you know to look?

38:30.725 --> 38:34.395
When he visited,
he told me he only had
two months left.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.314
When you screwed up,
I did the math.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.024
Why didn't you tell me
he was dying?

38:39.192 --> 38:40.818
He asked me not to.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.990
So you just
hung me out there
to be blindsided?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.118
Yeah, Chase,
it was all my fault.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.081
Look, you've got a choice.
You can either tell the truth,

38:54.207 --> 38:57.459
the hospital settles,
the family gets some money.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.878
They get to keep their house.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.756
Or you can keep up this lie.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.843
The family gets
punitive damages,

39:05.969 --> 39:08.387
they buy a jet,
and they move to Park Avenue,

39:09.389 --> 39:11.515
and you have to
find another career.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.350
You're not gonna
say anything?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.269
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.400
Legally, it's better for me
if you go down in flames.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.296
Is Chase telling
the committee about his dad?

39:43.214 --> 39:44.548
I don't know.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.220
I thought you were gonna
get him to sell me out.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.557
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

39:53.683 --> 39:55.392
You're my client, too.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.519
Yeah.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.149
And that's not gonna change
unless you leave this job,

40:02.984 --> 40:04.151
or I do.

40:04.778 --> 40:07.988
So how do you deal
with a coworker that
you have feelings for?

40:08.114 --> 40:09.823
Positive or negative.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.203
I don't wanna
end up like Chase.

40:14.496 --> 40:19.291
I don't wanna get
emotionally caught up
and kill you.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.300
It's not all negative.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.522
Maybe you were right,
maybe...

40:45.401 --> 40:47.194
Maybe that is the problem.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.578
So what do we do?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.502
I don't know.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.590
Dr. House?

41:20.311 --> 41:23.647
After considering
the testimonial and
documentary evidence,

41:23.773 --> 41:27.651
this ad-hoc committee in
the matter of Kayla McGinley
has reached a decision.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.069
Dr. Chase,

41:30.071 --> 41:32.489
your error resulted
in a patient's death.

41:32.782 --> 41:36.243
You also lied,
both to your superiors
and the patient's brother.

41:37.579 --> 41:40.873
But, taking into account
the mitigating factor
of your father's death,

41:40.999 --> 41:43.375
we've decided not to
revoke your privileges.

41:44.377 --> 41:48.380
You'll receive one week's
suspension, and a letter
in your permanent file.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.507
Now, as for Dr. House.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.302
There is no evidence
of a failure to supervise

41:53.428 --> 41:55.596
that would lead to
disciplinary action.

41:56.097 --> 42:00.976
And yet, there is enough
in the record to be
very troubled by your conduct,

42:01.477 --> 42:05.981
including certain allegations
of blackmail from members
of the transplant team,

42:06.107 --> 42:09.443
and by your general refusal
to meet with your patients.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.404
It should be noted
that your patient's cancer

42:12.530 --> 42:15.282
was diagnosed
as a result of a direct
physical examination...

42:15.408 --> 42:18.076
Not of the patient.
I met the brother,
never met her.

42:18.244 --> 42:22.497
Should I go to a family reunion
every time I take on a patient?

42:22.624 --> 42:25.250
The committee has
determined that
for no less than one month,

42:25.376 --> 42:28.545
Dr. House will have
his practice supervised
by another doctor,

42:28.671 --> 42:31.215
to be designated
by Dr. Cuddy.

42:31.341 --> 42:33.300
This proceeding is adjourned.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.275
Did you know this was coming?

42:50.401 --> 42:51.985
They contacted me
about an hour ago.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.862
What's happening to Chase?

42:54.155 --> 42:55.489
Now you're fired!

42:55.657 --> 42:57.241
No. He's not.

42:58.368 --> 42:59.326
Dr. House,

43:00.286 --> 43:01.828
meet your new boss.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.005
Guess I'm his best friend now.
