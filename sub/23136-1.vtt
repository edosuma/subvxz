01:16.909 --> 01:19.679
Now, I want sexy.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.248
Give me sexy.
I like sexy. Yes.

01:25.584 --> 01:31.391
I love it!
Beautiful. Nice.

01:35.894 --> 01:38.363
I like that.
I like that.

01:38.364 --> 01:41.367
Give me some plump.
Yeah. Do it. Do it.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.835
What about you?

01:43.836 --> 01:45.938
What about you?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.673
Yes.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.816
Beautiful.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.353
Seduce me.
Do it. Do it.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.926
Yes. I like that.

02:09.928 --> 02:12.899
That's hot.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.836
-Hey there, cutie.
-Hey.

02:18.003 --> 02:21.139
All right.
Here, everybody.

02:42.594 --> 02:44.830
I love it!

02:59.044 --> 03:01.781
Wait. Is that blood?

03:04.082 --> 03:07.719
-My God.
-Bloody hell.

03:13.157 --> 03:14.393
What is that?

03:14.394 --> 03:15.594
My God.

03:18.965 --> 03:21.000
Look! Over there!

03:21.001 --> 03:21.935
Is that a shark?

03:23.435 --> 03:24.903
-A shark?
-And a big one.

03:24.904 --> 03:26.972
-My God. Take a picture.
-Hey!

03:26.973 --> 03:28.875
Hey, Juan!
Juan, come here!

03:32.312 --> 03:34.547
Juan! Juan, get here, Juan!

03:34.582 --> 03:35.914
My God, Juan!

03:38.883 --> 03:41.353
We have a shark!

03:41.354 --> 03:43.656
Juan, bring your video camera!

03:43.657 --> 03:47.460
I love it.
Juan, bring your video camera!

03:47.461 --> 03:48.795
Come on!

03:50.795 --> 03:53.432
My God.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.471
-I like it like hell.
-Is there something in the water?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.243
There it is.
There it is.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.278
Beautiful.

04:13.718 --> 04:15.721
Holy shit, it's coming!

04:21.127 --> 04:23.763
Shit!

04:41.947 --> 04:44.983
<i>Attention San Juan Police.</i>

04:44.984 --> 04:46.918
<i>We have a federal report
of a shark attack</i>

04:46.919 --> 04:48.320
<i>off Palomino Island.</i>

04:48.321 --> 04:49.822
<i>Please investigate.</i>

04:51.589 --> 04:54.025
Calling dispatch.
This is Officer Sterling.

04:54.026 --> 04:57.562
We are approaching
Palomino Island. Standby.

05:09.141 --> 05:10.442
Hello?

05:12.110 --> 05:13.545
Anyone here?

05:16.581 --> 05:19.685
There should be six people
on this boat.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.487
Maybe they're diving.

05:26.358 --> 05:29.829
No. I don't think so.

05:32.663 --> 05:36.368
-Does it work?
-Let's see.

05:38.303 --> 05:39.438
Yeah.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.175
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.612
Go back. Did you see that?
Go back. That.

05:50.081 --> 05:51.783
What the hell?

05:54.920 --> 05:58.723
I better call
search and rescue. Now.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.959
Six people don't
disappear just like that.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.094
Copy.

06:24.382 --> 06:27.552
This may have convinced me
to become a vegetarian as well.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.889
I love vegetarians.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.958
-They taste great.
-Bon appétit.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.695
Here we go.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.663
God.

06:38.664 --> 06:41.000
Well, if the cyanide
killed fish...

06:44.569 --> 06:48.307
When they're filled with plastic,
they eventually starve to death.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.643
Way to go world.

06:55.079 --> 06:59.185
I don't even want to know.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.187
And to think,
humans produced

07:01.188 --> 07:04.423
almost 300 million tons
of this stuff.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.192
Too bad it's not nutritious.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.760
That's actually
not a bad idea.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.362
Nutritious, edible plastic.

07:10.363 --> 07:14.097
I have that already planning.
All right, guys? That's mine.

07:14.132 --> 07:18.669
Dr. Yost, these fine officers were
hoping to ask you a few questions.

07:18.670 --> 07:21.439
Something about a shark.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.209
Sure, let me just clean up.

07:27.812 --> 07:30.949
I think she means
while we clean up.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.651
Well, wait.
Why me?

07:32.652 --> 07:34.919
Come on, I'll help.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.456
Thanks.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.933
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure, officers?

07:49.968 --> 07:53.572
They're here investigating the
missing people on that yacht.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.675
Okay. I'm not sure that I
can help, but go for it.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.844
We believe this was
a shark attack.

07:59.845 --> 08:01.845
Do you know how many
shark attacks

08:01.880 --> 08:04.916
there have been
in Puerto Rico? Eleven.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.952
And no one's died
of a shark attack since 1924.

08:07.953 --> 08:10.588
I find it highly unlikely.

08:10.589 --> 08:12.858
-Sharks are dwindling in
oceans everywhere. -Yeah.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.394
Yeah. We know. They're not
here for a lecture, Dr. Yost.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.798
I was hoping that maybe
you can help me with this.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.666
I found this camera
on the boat.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.068
The people disappeared.

08:24.069 --> 08:26.538
We believe this is
a great white.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.875
Give me a break. Great whites
don't just kill people on boats.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.078
What's next, they fly
through tornadoes?

08:38.216 --> 08:40.586
That's odd.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.722
Can a shark like this exist?

08:44.990 --> 08:47.926
We've had multiple sightings
of some sort of...

08:47.927 --> 08:51.163
I think when Captain Sterling
is trying to ask is,

08:51.164 --> 08:54.799
Is it possible for shark
to have more than one head?

08:54.800 --> 08:58.769
Or is this just
a shark frenzy?

08:58.770 --> 09:01.139
Most likely the ladder.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.741
There have been reports
of sharks with multiple heads.

09:03.742 --> 09:06.110
I've heard of two
and even three-headed sharks,

09:06.111 --> 09:07.612
but shark attacks
are very rare here,

09:07.613 --> 09:09.614
so I wouldn't expect
another one.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.615
Did you say
multiple sightings?

09:11.616 --> 09:14.854
Yeah. We've received
a few calls.

09:14.855 --> 09:19.191
-This is a joke.
-Actually...

09:19.192 --> 09:22.595
it's not at all impossible.

09:24.596 --> 09:27.499
Let me look. Okay.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.903
There have been hundreds
if not thousands of instances

09:31.904 --> 09:33.706
of animals with more
than one head.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.407
Here's an actual
two-headed shark,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.340
but it only lived
a few hours.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.446
Also in mythology,
take for example, Cerberus.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.082
-Cerberus? -Cerberus was the
gigantic, two-headed hound of Hades,

09:44.083 --> 09:45.817
who guarded the gates
of the underworld

09:45.818 --> 09:47.651
and prevented the escape
of the shades of the dead.

09:47.652 --> 09:51.821
-I mean, it could be... -This
is just ridiculous. Laughable.

09:51.856 --> 09:55.492
I mean, a species like this couldn't
even exist with multiple heads.

09:55.493 --> 09:58.129
As far as I can tell, these are
digital distortions on the image.

09:58.130 --> 10:02.801
Or should we call them myths?
Or simply Photoshop.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.737
-Yeah. But right...
-No. No buts.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.838
This is just not possible.

10:07.839 --> 10:09.674
Correct, doctor?

10:15.714 --> 10:19.585
I have to agree,
it's very unlikely.

10:19.586 --> 10:23.019
Well. Anyway.

10:23.054 --> 10:26.825
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.

10:26.826 --> 10:27.959
-Appreciate it.
-Good luck.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.894
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:55.486 --> 10:56.554
Hey, Dr. Yo.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.955
How's it looking out here?

10:57.956 --> 11:00.125
Why are we going out again?

11:00.126 --> 11:02.826
The aquarium's future,
my future.

11:02.827 --> 11:06.331
Our futures.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.432
What's he talking about,
Dr. Yo?

11:08.433 --> 11:10.201
She didn't tell you.

11:11.403 --> 11:12.937
Tell us what?

11:12.938 --> 11:15.807
We're going to catch
the shark everyone's hunting.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.243
-That's right.
-What?

11:19.244 --> 11:22.714
-Here she goes. Watch this.
-Shut up, Ram.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.950
Is this for real?

11:24.951 --> 11:28.054
We're supposed
to catch a shark? Seriously?

11:30.655 --> 11:32.690
Dr. Yo?

11:32.691 --> 11:36.028
I'm so sorry. My hands are tied.
I was going to tell you guys.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.330
We can't actually do that,
can we?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.099
-Technically, n...
-Technically,

11:40.100 --> 11:43.235
it falls under the purview
of "Don't ask, don't tell."

11:43.236 --> 11:45.601
And we're all okay
with that, right?

11:45.636 --> 11:48.740
Because if you're not, you can
say good-bye to this job,

11:48.741 --> 11:50.742
this opportunity,
and your futures.

11:52.409 --> 11:55.014
You could gone about this
a different way.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.081
You didn't have to put out
a press release.

11:57.082 --> 11:59.683
What way would that
have been?

11:59.684 --> 12:01.319
The right way.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.658
Dr. Yo, I'm not here to mince
words, okay? We need a shark.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.960
And what better than the
killer great white shark?

12:08.961 --> 12:10.562
And we need it now.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.630
It's no secret that aquarium
is suffering, and the only way

12:12.631 --> 12:16.367
we're going to stay afloat is
if we can get a big exhibit.

12:16.368 --> 12:19.705
Otherwise, we're done.
It's that simple.

12:19.706 --> 12:24.643
Get the kids what they want.
Something different, right? A shark!

12:24.644 --> 12:27.879
I mean, anyone can get a snorkel
and a pair of fins and see

12:27.880 --> 12:30.816
80% of the species
we got in that aquarium.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.716
<i>But a shark...</i>

12:33.751 --> 12:36.320
that sells tickets.

12:36.321 --> 12:40.125
Besides, it's conservation.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.927
We can study it. We can rid
the ocean of this danger.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.929
If we don't do it, there
will be droves of poachers

12:45.930 --> 12:47.500
killing dozens of sharks.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.900
I mean, that'd be horrible.

12:51.302 --> 12:54.938
So, everyone, you're
either in or you're out.

12:54.939 --> 12:57.842
And if you're out, I'd ask you
to step off the boat now.

13:05.049 --> 13:07.185
Okay, good.
Let's head out.

13:34.011 --> 13:39.217
Bait's all set. Cameras,
batteries, bait. All set.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.785
I'll check the feed
on the GoPro.

13:45.323 --> 13:47.992
-Linds, you good on your monitor?
-Yeah.

13:52.397 --> 13:54.633
I don't like this.
I don't even think it's legal.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.670
Yeah, me neither.

13:57.705 --> 14:00.706
-Anything?
-Nothing.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.038
Not even a guppy.

14:03.073 --> 14:05.376
-You have anything, Linds?
-No.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.245
But that could be
a good thing.

14:07.246 --> 14:10.048
Sharks, they tend to scare other
animals when they're around.

14:10.049 --> 14:13.117
But there's, like,
nothing here.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.719
Yeah, she's right.
I don't see anything.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.792
I mean, no fish,
no crustaceans,

14:20.793 --> 14:22.259
not even at a snail.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.096
Not that surprised,
word is the coral is dying

14:24.097 --> 14:26.264
because of the cyanide
being used by the fishermen

14:26.265 --> 14:28.700
for the fish
for aquarium trade.

14:28.701 --> 14:33.071
Aren't we kind of complicit
in that now?

14:33.072 --> 14:37.910
Hey son, throw it in
like you got a pair. Okay?

14:45.384 --> 14:49.687
Wish we had
a little dog or something.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.591
You know, that's really get
the beast belly rolling.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.760
Are you serious?
That's messed up.

14:56.961 --> 14:59.197
-I was just kidding.
-Are you?

15:20.485 --> 15:22.019
Hey, guys,
I think I see something.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.989
Right there.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.098
-There, there. -Yeah, there's
definitely something there.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.331
What is it?

15:34.332 --> 15:35.701
I don't know, but it
looked like a fin.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.503
Game on.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.405
-Ram, you got anything?
-Nothing.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.649
Guys, guys!

15:50.650 --> 15:53.150
I thought...
I thought I saw something.

15:53.151 --> 15:54.452
It went away.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.420
Anybody? Anybody
seen anything?

15:56.421 --> 15:59.291
I didn't see nothing
on the video.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.592
-Well.
-Maybe we should get the nets?

16:14.873 --> 16:16.575
My God, my God!

16:16.576 --> 16:17.792
-I saw it.
-What did you see?

16:17.827 --> 16:19.009
I think it ate the camera.

16:19.010 --> 16:22.014
-Are you sure?
-It's definitely there.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.383
I think it's under the boat.

16:28.385 --> 16:29.554
Well, let's get the nets.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.706
Sean!

16:49.975 --> 16:51.576
Grab it, Sean!

16:53.711 --> 16:55.346
Sean!

17:02.953 --> 17:05.057
My God.

17:09.827 --> 17:11.462
Sean!

17:59.376 --> 18:03.281
We are aquarium,
we're headed back in.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.185
We've had an accident.
One fatality.

18:17.828 --> 18:19.931
There's nothing
we could have done.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.869
I know, but why?
Why him?

18:27.071 --> 18:28.339
The ocean's
a beautiful place,

18:28.340 --> 18:32.276
but it can also be
a dangerous place.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.580
We all knew that.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.552
Sean knew that.
He grew up out there.

19:14.451 --> 19:17.321
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks. Thanks.

19:26.763 --> 19:27.698
Hi.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.536
We're very sorry
for what happened.

19:33.571 --> 19:37.341
But we need to confirm
a few things if you don't mind.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.011
It wasn't a shark.

19:41.012 --> 19:45.951
-But it was... -It was
shaped like a starfish.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.719
It had four heads.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.855
I couldn't tell.
It all happened so fast.

19:50.856 --> 19:55.192
Multiple heads.
Shaped like a starfish.

19:55.193 --> 19:58.096
Do you think they're going
to say anything about...

19:58.097 --> 19:59.865
Are you kidding me?

19:59.866 --> 20:04.701
One of our team just died.
That's what you worried about?

20:04.702 --> 20:08.472
Just asking a question. I
know it sounds ridiculous.

20:08.473 --> 20:12.577
We know what we saw.
That thing killed Sean.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.779
You mean something like this?

20:20.117 --> 20:22.486
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:25.356 --> 20:28.426
I think you need to take a
good look at your priorities.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.663
My priorities are exactly
where they need to be.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.365
It's sad that we lost
one of our own,

20:34.366 --> 20:36.835
but the show must go on,
as they say.

20:40.338 --> 20:41.906
Thank you.

20:48.546 --> 20:53.151
-I want you to go back out there.
-What?

20:53.152 --> 20:56.421
I'm not putting myself or
anymore of my team in danger,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.923
especially for whatever
that was.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.993
Whatever it was,
it is worth millions.

21:03.929 --> 21:08.633
-I'm not going to do it.
-Yes you will.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.699
And you'll do it
with a smile.

21:10.734 --> 21:14.839
This is your chance to study one of
nature's most interesting anomalies.

21:18.209 --> 21:20.612
Atta girl.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.483
Now go, get us
our marquee attraction.

21:28.252 --> 21:30.721
So, the first attack
was here.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.924
And this is where the
aquarium intern got killed.

21:33.925 --> 21:38.028
Yeah. That's two
attacks in two days.

21:38.029 --> 21:40.397
We should consider
shutting everything down.

21:40.398 --> 21:41.899
No, no, no, no.
That's impossible.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.871
What about
if we put a warning sign?

21:45.872 --> 21:48.974
You know, I'm going to talk to the
chief about posting a reward.

21:49.009 --> 21:50.875
Yeah, yeah.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.365
All right,
reel them in there.

22:15.366 --> 22:17.669
The trap is set.
The food is chill.

22:22.773 --> 22:25.042
Did you see that?
It looks like a shark fin.

22:31.382 --> 22:33.582
Yeah, I saw it.
Where'd it go?

22:33.617 --> 22:35.753
-I can't see it.
-All right, calm down now.

22:56.106 --> 22:58.843
-So, what do you say?
-No way.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.679
I'm not going back out there.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.478
You're kidding, right?
Sean just died!

23:03.513 --> 23:07.784
Come on, team. We're talking about
a once in a lifetime discovery.

23:07.785 --> 23:10.055
Right in our own backyard.

23:11.888 --> 23:13.657
Don't you want to be
a part of history?

23:17.461 --> 23:21.700
And before somebody
out there kills it?

23:24.068 --> 23:28.973
Do you really think Sean would
want you to just give up?

23:32.242 --> 23:35.312
No, I don't think so.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.381
And if we make
a new discovery,

23:37.382 --> 23:42.487
we can name it after Sean, as a tribute
to his passion and his sacrifice.

23:43.587 --> 23:45.956
What do you say, Dr. Yo?

23:45.957 --> 23:50.292
You can't lie to them, sir.
They're not children.

23:50.327 --> 23:56.533
-He wants to catch this thing.
-Yes, a multi-headed shark

23:56.534 --> 23:58.503
or a new species.

24:00.171 --> 24:02.238
Either way, we all win
by catching it.

24:02.273 --> 24:05.575
There's no way a shark like
that could survive to maturity.

24:05.576 --> 24:07.778
Have you seen one before?

24:07.779 --> 24:10.181
Studied one for that matter?

24:10.182 --> 24:11.482
No.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.384
So what's to say
it's not impossible?

24:13.385 --> 24:17.121
That what we saw out there
wasn't an isolated incident?

24:17.122 --> 24:22.093
There could be more.
Hundreds. Maybe thousands.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.593
An entirely new species.

24:24.628 --> 24:27.631
And we're the ones
who saw it.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.701
And we're the ones
who can have it.

24:30.702 --> 24:36.707
-Ask yourselves, what would Sean want?
-You just want to display it.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.142
Put it in your aquarium.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.545
We can't do that.

24:42.613 --> 24:46.582
Can we, Dr. Yo?

24:46.617 --> 24:50.054
Catching it for the sake
of making money, no.

24:50.055 --> 24:55.460
But bringing it in
for research, yes.

24:55.461 --> 25:00.531
Whatever it was that killed
Sean, we have to study it.

25:00.532 --> 25:04.668
Think of it as vengeance
for your friend.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.605
By taking this beast
out of its element,

25:07.606 --> 25:12.009
you could have a once in a lifetime
chance to study an amazing specimen.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.645
Okay.

25:18.415 --> 25:20.350
Okay.

25:20.351 --> 25:25.524
Let's say we do this, how do we
even propose we kill this thing?

25:40.404 --> 25:42.606
I hope you know
what you're doing, Dr. Yost.

25:42.607 --> 25:46.277
Trust me, if anyone knows how to
catch something like this, it's Red.

25:46.278 --> 25:51.582
-Hey, Red! Red.
-Yo!

25:55.019 --> 25:57.654
Yo, yo, yo. Dr. Yo, get
over here, give me a hug.

25:57.655 --> 26:00.191
Okay, please put me down.
Put me down.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.491
Put me down.
Thank you.

26:01.492 --> 26:05.162
So, you two know each other?

26:05.163 --> 26:08.865
Yeah, use to do
research together.

26:08.866 --> 26:10.667
Yeah, I think they get it.

26:10.668 --> 26:13.770
Can you just tell them how you
think we can catch the shark.

26:13.771 --> 26:15.706
Yeah, we're going
to use sonar.

26:15.707 --> 26:18.476
All right, if the shark is as big as
you said it is, it'll be easy to find.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.478
Sharks, all they do is they
eat and they get it on, so.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.548
-Pretty simple creatures, actually.
-They're not creatures.

26:23.549 --> 26:27.284
They're classified
under the Clad Selachimorpha.

26:27.285 --> 26:28.987
Yeah, Selachimorpha.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.455
-She's right.
-You're a shark hunter.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.023
Among other things.

26:33.024 --> 26:37.194
Aqua adventures
and water sports, you know.

26:38.662 --> 26:40.362
So.

26:40.397 --> 26:42.966
-You're gonna go out on a
boat like that? -Yeah.

26:42.967 --> 26:44.465
I was planning on it.
Why do you ask?

26:44.500 --> 26:46.971
If you're cool with
getting blood and guts

26:46.972 --> 26:47.971
all over you, that's fine.

26:47.972 --> 26:50.075
You just, you be you, okay?

26:52.509 --> 26:54.244
You ready to go kill
the shark or what?

26:54.245 --> 26:55.179
Um.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.384
Well, it's not
just any shark.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.121
It's already killed
seven people that we know of.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.889
One of them was our friend.

27:10.228 --> 27:14.666
Man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:15.865 --> 27:19.037
You know, he was with us.

27:19.038 --> 27:24.408
And this thing
kind of has multiple heads.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.878
-Yeah.
-Four, actually.

27:27.879 --> 27:31.949
You almost had me there.
Four heads.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.219
Seriously?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.754
Yeah.

27:37.121 --> 27:41.625
Well, I guess it'll be
four times the fun then.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.794
But we want to take it alive.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.028
Take it alive?

27:45.029 --> 27:47.064
Try to take it alive.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.166
Killing it is one thing,
but bringing it home alive,

27:49.201 --> 27:51.336
that's a whole other bucket
of chum, guys.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.238
We were kind of hoping to keep
this under the radar, so to say.

27:54.239 --> 27:57.007
We, the aquarium,
has a vested interest

27:57.042 --> 27:59.776
in finding out
what this beast actually is.

27:59.777 --> 28:01.546
Yeah, I get it.

28:01.547 --> 28:06.383
But I'm willing to pay double
whatever the reward is on the shark.

28:06.384 --> 28:09.220
Double? Double?

28:09.221 --> 28:11.454
You didn't tell me that.

28:11.455 --> 28:12.723
Yo, you got a deal.

28:12.724 --> 28:14.825
Good. I'm glad we understand
each other.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.794
So, what's the plan?

28:16.795 --> 28:19.163
Well, we're gonna lay a bloodline.
We're gonna lure it in.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.531
We're gonna shoot it,
we're gonna sedate it,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.099
and we're gonna tow it back
to shore.

28:22.100 --> 28:25.235
That's it?
That's your big plan?

28:25.236 --> 28:27.938
Yeah. That's it, kid.
This ain't my first fish fry.

28:27.939 --> 28:32.777
If things go south and it gets out
of control, then we go plan B.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.980
Plan B?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.180
Yeah.

28:39.215 --> 28:42.419
I know. I'm sorry, Yo.
I know you hate these things.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.391
Live.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.759
I'll do my best.

28:52.663 --> 28:56.666
All right, guys, lets see
what she has to offer us.

28:56.667 --> 28:59.102
The reef's a lot more barren
compared to last year's dive.

28:59.103 --> 29:03.340
The plant life, algae, even most of the
bottom-feeders seem to have checked out.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.475
That's called global warming.

29:05.476 --> 29:10.381
Yeah, and humans once again think
they can dump whatever they want,

29:10.382 --> 29:12.747
wherever they want.

29:12.782 --> 29:15.486
-All right, enough chitchat.
-Let's get to work.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.556
Take your readings, collect
anything that seems out of place.

29:18.557 --> 29:22.594
Roger that. Compared to last year,
she's down a few millimeters.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.561
That's definitely not
what we are hoping for.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.830
No, it was not.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.833
Hey, I'm going to head around the reef.
Check the backside.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.266
Be careful.

29:31.301 --> 29:34.103
And watch your back. Keep
an eye out for that thing.

29:34.104 --> 29:35.439
I'll be fine.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.441
Famous last words.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.178
Hey, how long have I been
doing this with you guys?

29:42.078 --> 29:43.914
-Too long.
-Exactly.

29:43.915 --> 29:46.584
I've swam with sharks hundreds
of times all over the world.

29:46.585 --> 29:50.020
I think I'll be fine. Just give me
some time on this side of the world.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.960
I'll be back in a minute.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.230
-Fine, just be careful.
-I always am.

30:31.229 --> 30:36.698
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:36.733 --> 30:41.538
-How you been? -I'm okay,
all things considered.

30:41.539 --> 30:44.974
Yeah. If it were up to me,
I'd just kill the damn thing.

30:44.975 --> 30:46.743
After all that's happened.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.444
Seriously?

30:48.445 --> 30:51.115
I'm sorry.
I know how you are.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.017
How exactly am I?

30:53.018 --> 30:55.584
How are ya?

30:55.619 --> 30:57.454
You know, vegan, free-range,

30:57.455 --> 31:00.657
tree-hugging,
saving the world kind of gal.

31:00.658 --> 31:03.760
I'm sorry it offends you
that I care about animals,

31:03.761 --> 31:05.962
I'm a marine biologist.

31:05.963 --> 31:07.565
Yeah, I know. I know.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.601
And you capture them,
and you put them in aquariums

31:09.602 --> 31:11.135
for a whole bunch
of tourons to see.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.971
Yeah, I get it.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.405
Please don't start with me.

31:17.807 --> 31:21.913
Glad to see nothing changes
but the date, Yo!

31:34.825 --> 31:36.561
Hey.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.640
-You all right?
-I can't sleep.

31:49.973 --> 31:55.879
I keep thinking about
what happened to Sean.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.513
I shouldn't be out here.

31:58.548 --> 32:01.519
I'm not a shark hunter,
I'm a marine biologist,

32:01.520 --> 32:04.154
and an intern at that.

32:05.522 --> 32:08.292
Whatever's out there,
it's dangerous.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.629
You want to know something?

32:13.763 --> 32:17.501
I'm scared too.

32:17.502 --> 32:21.704
But don't think about it
for the money or the research.

32:21.705 --> 32:23.640
Do it for Sean.

32:23.641 --> 32:26.210
And make sure
that whatever happened to him,

32:26.211 --> 32:29.047
doesn't happen to anyone
else ever again.

32:29.913 --> 32:33.084
-Okay?
-Okay.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.535
So, this part of Puerto Rico

32:51.536 --> 32:53.604
is actually called
Roosevelt Roads.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.073
It's actually a
decommissioned US naval base.

32:56.074 --> 32:58.506
My father actually
served here back in '68.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.877
It's one of my favorite
places to come on the island.

33:00.878 --> 33:05.081
The reason I wanted to bring you
here today is because this part

33:05.082 --> 33:07.218
of Fajardo
actually has manatees.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.286
Have you folks
ever seen a manatee?

33:09.287 --> 33:11.221
They're beautiful,
docile creatures.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.923
They're very loving,
kind animals.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.726
But there's only 700 of them
left here in Puerto Rico.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.563
We have to do everything
we can to conserve them,

33:18.564 --> 33:21.331
to make sure they're happy and that
they thrive in this community.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.765
So, get your cameras out.

33:22.766 --> 33:26.670
We should see a couple
manatees here in the harbor.

33:30.307 --> 33:31.741
Folks, folks,
look over there.

33:31.742 --> 33:33.411
Folks, get your cameras.
Look right over there.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.778
Come here. Come over here.
Get your cameras out.

33:35.779 --> 33:37.580
Humpback whale.

33:37.581 --> 33:39.616
You never see them this close
into the island. You see them?

33:39.617 --> 33:42.385
Get your cameras. Get a photo of this.
This is a very rare sighting.

33:42.386 --> 33:45.623
We never get whales this close into
the island here in Puerto Rico.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.525
Make sure you get a picture.

33:58.402 --> 34:00.269
Fantastic.
Look at that.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.038
-Look at that.
-That's cool.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.107
Look at that.

34:14.751 --> 34:15.786
This is such a treat today.

34:24.762 --> 34:27.297
My God!

34:30.434 --> 34:34.070
Let's just back away
from the water here.

34:34.071 --> 34:37.340
Okay, guys,
get inside the boat.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.208
-Get inside the boat.
-Get inside the boat.

34:40.577 --> 34:42.646
This is Vessel Bodega.
Mayday, mayday.

34:42.647 --> 34:46.818
We have just seen a humpback whale
attacked by a large predator.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.954
<i>Mayday, mayday! Mayday.</i>

34:51.955 --> 34:54.357
<i>We've seen a humpback
whale...</i>

34:54.358 --> 34:56.693
<i>attacked by
a large predator.</i>

34:56.694 --> 34:59.430
<i>He's coming for us. Start the boat.
Start the boat.</i>

34:59.465 --> 35:00.864
<i>Start the boat.</i>

35:00.865 --> 35:02.965
Jesus. Come in, Bodega.

35:02.966 --> 35:05.301
<i>This is Captain Sterling
from the policia de Fajardo.</i>

35:05.302 --> 35:07.704
The shark appears
to be coming towards us.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.306
Get back, get back.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.684
We are headed your way.
I'll meet you at the dock.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.019
-Vamos.
-Sí.

35:22.054 --> 35:23.119
Go! Go!

35:23.120 --> 35:25.422
We are coming into
the harbor now.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.858
The shark appears
to be following us.

35:32.028 --> 35:35.865
<i>-Any vessels in the area?
-Please help</i>

35:35.866 --> 35:37.835
Copy that. Over.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.304
Looks like our shark might
have found its next meal.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.639
Let's go get this bad boy.

35:50.514 --> 35:53.050
As fast as you can.

35:53.051 --> 35:55.620
The shark is following us.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.864
Go, captain, go!

36:08.864 --> 36:11.301
Hey, that whale boat
is about to become lunch.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.570
Hey, guys, guys,
it's time to go get a shark.

36:13.571 --> 36:14.769
All right, here we go.

36:14.804 --> 36:16.507
Grabbed that chum.
Let's go!

36:16.508 --> 36:18.376
Right off of here.

36:20.143 --> 36:23.346
What's that? It's a
speargun with a sonar tag.

36:23.347 --> 36:27.050
-Won't that kill it? -It's not
impossible that it won't.

36:27.051 --> 36:28.952
But at least if it doesn't,
I'll know where it is.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.454
<i>-I told you not to kill it.
-Hey!</i>

36:31.455 --> 36:34.391
I'm the captain of this ship. You
don't tell me anything, all right?

36:34.392 --> 36:37.894
And make yourself useful
and get out of my way.

36:44.001 --> 36:47.237
My God.

36:56.746 --> 36:59.549
<i>-Anybody?
-Help us!</i>

37:04.255 --> 37:05.787
We need to go back to shore.

37:05.822 --> 37:07.724
We already lost Sean.
I'm not losing anyone else.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.393
We're not going back to shore.
We got a boat out here.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.763
We got people in trouble.
We gotta go get this shark.

37:14.931 --> 37:16.567
Go, go!

37:26.376 --> 37:28.978
It's quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go. Go ahead.

37:28.979 --> 37:31.714
Nice and safe, but get quick. I
want to get you guys on the land.

37:31.715 --> 37:33.684
It's okay.
You should be safe now.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.420
Let's get you on the shore.
It's okay.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.523
Get you on the shore.
Nice and slow, guys.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.791
-What happened?
-It's a large predator.

37:41.792 --> 37:44.961
It's... it's a shark,
but it has multiple heads.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.965
It ate a humpback whale
out there.

37:56.373 --> 37:59.108
Where is it? Anybody see it?
You got eyes on it?

37:59.109 --> 38:00.677
Where is it?

38:01.911 --> 38:02.846
I don't know.

38:14.958 --> 38:18.495
-Guys! It's coming!
-It's coming!

38:39.150 --> 38:42.552
My God. No.

38:43.820 --> 38:46.656
Day Off, do you copy?
He's going your way now.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.532
Right there, right there.
That's where it is.

39:07.411 --> 39:08.546
Wait a minute.

39:10.847 --> 39:13.851
Where'd it go?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.688
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.956
Wait, where'd it go?

39:18.957 --> 39:20.957
-Hold on. Hold on.
-Hold on. Hold on.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.460
Everybody listen.
Just chill.

39:24.961 --> 39:26.563
<i>Day Off, do you copy?</i>

39:26.564 --> 39:28.132
What are they doing?

39:28.133 --> 39:30.800
I don't know. I think
they're trying to catch it.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.938
-Anybody got eyes on it?
-No.

39:42.045 --> 39:45.916
-Get out of the water!
-Get out of the water!

39:49.052 --> 39:50.487
Hold on.
Hold on.

40:14.978 --> 40:17.181
Lindsay!

40:24.586 --> 40:27.425
Lindsay!

40:37.134 --> 40:38.969
My God.

40:46.309 --> 40:50.079
At least the sonar tag's
still inside that thing.

40:55.318 --> 40:57.855
Let's get some help.

40:57.856 --> 40:58.856
Copy.

41:21.945 --> 41:25.147
Yes, the shark is dead
and I plan to pay him.

41:25.182 --> 41:28.350
I just need to know
if insurance will cover this.

41:28.351 --> 41:32.222
Yeah, we're almost bankrupt anyway,
but I can't go to jail over this.

41:32.223 --> 41:38.428
Look. Just do your job
and find out.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.998
I can't believe you.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.733
Hey, guys.

41:43.734 --> 41:45.869
I think you killed it.

41:45.870 --> 41:49.439
I mean, there's no way anything can
survive a harpoon in the heart, right?

41:49.474 --> 41:53.009
So, I don't have to shutdown
any public beaches, right?

41:53.010 --> 41:55.176
Until I see a carcass,
I ain't buying it.

41:55.211 --> 41:58.882
Yeah, a normal size shark eats
about 11 tons of food a year,

41:58.883 --> 42:03.219
and whatever that was, it was at least three
times the size of a normal shark, so.

42:03.220 --> 42:06.891
I mean, if it's still alive, it's
going to kill again, and soon.

42:08.492 --> 42:12.896
Look, half the people on this
island work in the ocean.

42:12.897 --> 42:14.531
And the other half
are here for vacation.

42:14.566 --> 42:15.731
So, that's it.

42:15.732 --> 42:18.701
That's it?
It's over?

42:18.702 --> 42:23.740
Look, I'm sorry about your
friends, okay? Go home, rest.

42:23.741 --> 42:26.076
He's right.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.512
Let's all take a week off.
Go home and rest.

42:29.513 --> 42:31.215
You're such
a horrible person.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.016
We should've never gone
back out there.

42:33.017 --> 42:35.719
Now this is all my fault.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.722
Yeah, it is.
Who's else would it be?

42:39.723 --> 42:42.826
Two of our teams dead.
Sean died.

42:42.827 --> 42:45.795
And then we were crazy enough
to go back out there,

42:45.796 --> 42:47.330
and now Lindsay's dead.

42:47.331 --> 42:48.963
And it's still not my fault.

42:48.998 --> 42:52.568
If Lindsay had been more
careful, she'd be here now.

42:52.569 --> 42:55.605
-You forced us.
-Please.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.907
You guys wanted this shark
as much as I did.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.244
To name it after yourself or
make the scientific discovery

43:01.245 --> 43:03.747
to put your names
in the history book.

43:03.782 --> 43:05.882
You just wanted payday.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.751
-Plain and simple. You killed
Sean and Lindsay! -Hey, hey, hey!

43:10.688 --> 43:13.824
No, no, no, no, no.
Knock it off, all right.

43:14.690 --> 43:16.259
Both of you guys.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.762
Now, listen. I know that
your friends are dead.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.428
Both of them,
and I'm sorry about that.

43:20.463 --> 43:22.431
There's nothing that we can
do about that now,

43:22.432 --> 43:26.602
and fighting about is not gonna
do anybody any good, is it?

43:26.603 --> 43:28.371
You okay, kid?

43:48.625 --> 43:51.927
Good news guys, we have reports
that the shark that was

43:51.928 --> 43:55.364
delaying this year's
surf classic has been killed.

43:55.365 --> 43:59.702
And as you can see, life is back
to normal here at Playa Aviones.

43:59.703 --> 44:05.175
Where the action is just about to begin
at the 10th Annual Surf Classic.

44:05.176 --> 44:08.008
And by my side
I have a very special guest.

44:08.043 --> 44:12.014
He's one of Puerto Rico's hottest
musicians and a great guy,

44:12.015 --> 44:14.884
PJ Sin Suela!

44:14.885 --> 44:16.318
How are you doing today, PJ?

44:16.319 --> 44:18.788
I'm doing just fine.
It's a great day.

44:18.789 --> 44:21.557
Great waves. Great surfers.
Head out here, man.

44:21.558 --> 44:23.092
Nice. He's going to be

44:23.093 --> 44:25.428
-performing live here at Playa...
-Shark!

44:27.998 --> 44:29.400
Get out of the water!

44:32.402 --> 44:33.402
Shark! Shark!
Shark! Shark!

44:33.403 --> 44:35.971
Shark! Get out of the water!

44:35.972 --> 44:39.976
Ladies and gentlemen, there seems
to be something in the water.

44:39.977 --> 44:41.979
Get out of the water!

44:42.014 --> 44:43.346
Shark!

44:53.757 --> 44:55.325
My God!

44:59.463 --> 45:00.397
My God!

45:07.536 --> 45:11.140
-There's been another shark attack.
-What?

45:11.141 --> 45:14.244
At Playa Aviones.
At the Surf competition.

45:16.445 --> 45:17.380
Damn it.

45:22.119 --> 45:23.954
I told you I wasn't buying it.

45:51.447 --> 45:52.715
What happened?

45:52.716 --> 45:56.085
It was gnarly. I've never
seen anything like this.

45:56.086 --> 45:59.289
This shark,
it has, like, five heads.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.925
Maybe six.
I couldn't tell.

46:01.926 --> 46:05.961
It attacked the whole lineup. There was
blood everywhere. It was horrible.

46:05.962 --> 46:09.432
I'm still looking for my partner.
He went in.

46:10.766 --> 46:13.569
This is a disaster.

46:13.570 --> 46:17.223
How's it looking out there?

46:17.258 --> 46:20.877
Sixteen injured.
Five dead.

46:20.878 --> 46:22.843
We have to stop this thing
before more people die.

46:22.878 --> 46:28.050
It's times like these I wished
sharks had natural predators.

46:28.051 --> 46:30.520
I have an idea.

46:38.494 --> 46:41.030
We're under attack
from the most amazing

46:41.031 --> 46:42.798
scientific discovery
of our lifetime,

46:42.799 --> 46:45.034
and you're
showing us dolphins.

46:45.035 --> 46:47.003
Just watch.
I think I found something.

46:54.677 --> 46:56.378
What do they see?

46:56.379 --> 46:58.447
We observe this behavior
when a pod of dolphins

46:58.448 --> 47:00.315
came into contact
with a great white.

47:00.316 --> 47:02.751
They were able to
manipulate it into leaving.

47:02.752 --> 47:05.688
Too bad we didn't bring a pod
of trained dolphins with us.

47:05.689 --> 47:10.393
-Yeah but we have the next best thing.
-What's that?

47:10.394 --> 47:12.728
We have speakers.

47:12.729 --> 47:14.330
So, you're saying
that we're going to use

47:14.331 --> 47:16.365
the dolphin sound
to scare the shark?

47:16.366 --> 47:18.800
Hang on the second.
She's right.

47:18.801 --> 47:20.503
Sharks hate dolphins.

47:20.504 --> 47:23.470
They might look cute but you
don't want to piss them off.

47:23.505 --> 47:26.308
So, you're saying we lay a
speakerline, right? To isolate them.

47:26.309 --> 47:29.146
Let me show you
where you do that.

47:32.514 --> 47:34.150
All right, so we're going
to use the bathymetry

47:34.151 --> 47:35.852
along the coastline
right here, okay?

47:35.887 --> 47:36.886
We're gonna lay
a speakerline.

47:36.887 --> 47:38.519
We put the bait here.

47:38.554 --> 47:41.757
We rig it with explosives and we
blow this damn thing to pieces.

47:41.758 --> 47:43.358
We eliminate it completely.

47:43.359 --> 47:45.427
Yeah, but I don't have
that much explosives.

47:45.428 --> 47:46.862
All I got is a couple M-80s
on the boat.

47:46.863 --> 47:48.731
-You got anything?
-Yeah. I have dynamite.

47:48.732 --> 47:53.235
I still have... got 20 grand
if you bring it in alive.

47:53.236 --> 47:54.603
How much dynamite you got?

47:54.604 --> 47:56.772
Oof, enough to wipe Fajardo
off the map.

47:56.773 --> 47:57.974
Yeah?

47:57.975 --> 47:59.476
Well, this should be fun.

47:59.477 --> 48:04.646
So, we isolate this shark
and then blamo, right?

48:04.647 --> 48:06.650
You got it, kid.
Way to go.

48:07.784 --> 48:08.986
Anybody ready to go kill
a shark?

48:11.286 --> 48:14.023
-For Sean and Lindsay.
-For Sean and Lindsay.

48:14.024 --> 48:17.460
For Sean and Lindsay.
Let's go do this. Come on.

48:21.063 --> 48:24.567
For Sean and Lindsay.

48:30.206 --> 48:33.809
The inlet
is right here, okay?

48:33.810 --> 48:36.645
So, once we find the shark we're
gonna to circle around it.

48:36.646 --> 48:39.416
I'm going to use the sound to
lead it towards the abandon ship.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.018
Okay, I'm gonna take
the bait and the chargers

48:41.053 --> 48:42.619
and I'm gonna put them
over here on the west side.

48:42.620 --> 48:44.254
That's going
to create our net, right?

48:44.289 --> 48:45.889
You got the speakers ready?

48:45.890 --> 48:49.459
Yeah, I got three speakers set
and three buoys ready to go.

48:49.494 --> 48:51.727
Okay, my team is on it.
Okay, let's go.

48:51.728 --> 48:54.597
-All right, let's do it.
-That makes both of us.

48:54.598 --> 48:57.564
Just you wait
you little whippersnapper.

48:57.599 --> 49:01.038
Hey, come on, let's go!
We got a fish to catch.

49:52.188 --> 49:54.590
-Any sign of it yet?
-Not yet.

49:54.591 --> 50:00.128
No. The sonar should start picking
it up in a couple of miles.

50:00.129 --> 50:03.432
How far to the inlet?

50:03.433 --> 50:05.635
About another 15 minutes.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.903
Sounds good. I'm going to
get the speakers ready.

50:07.904 --> 50:09.539
Yeah, go get 'em, girl.

50:13.342 --> 50:16.545
Hey, listen, man.

50:16.546 --> 50:18.614
I know we're not out here
for what you paid me for,

50:18.615 --> 50:23.285
but whatever you plan
on doing with that shark,

50:23.286 --> 50:24.488
it ain't worth it.

50:28.123 --> 50:29.692
You're right.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.894
It's already killed
too many people.

50:31.895 --> 50:33.663
It's the right thing to do.

50:33.664 --> 50:35.197
The right thing to do
would be not

50:35.198 --> 50:37.366
put your employees
in danger.

50:37.367 --> 50:41.271
I know. I can't take
back what's happened.

50:44.172 --> 50:46.108
We're good?

50:47.811 --> 50:49.679
Really, I'm sorry.

50:51.146 --> 50:52.548
You should be.

50:54.449 --> 50:56.185
All right, guys,
enough of this.

50:56.186 --> 50:57.320
We got a shark to kill.

50:59.789 --> 51:04.561
-Hey. You doing okay?
-I'm all right.

51:07.862 --> 51:13.202
-I'm sorry about your friend.
-Thank you.

51:13.203 --> 51:14.971
Seemed like a good kid.

51:14.972 --> 51:18.708
She was my best friend, too.

51:19.775 --> 51:20.876
I'm sorry.

51:20.877 --> 51:23.346
Have you ever lost someone
to a shark?

51:23.347 --> 51:26.516
Oof, yeah.
Yep. Spear fishing.

51:26.517 --> 51:30.987
Back in 1997, El Niño year,
a yellowtail running.

51:30.988 --> 51:36.393
And we were diving down in the kelp bed and
buddy got a nice size yellow on there.

51:38.061 --> 51:39.896
Got wrapped up in the kelp.

51:39.897 --> 51:41.865
By the time I got to him,
he was gone.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.235
The shark took his leg off.

51:46.236 --> 51:49.271
He bled out.

51:49.272 --> 51:52.174
That was about
the end of that.

51:52.175 --> 51:54.577
I'm so sorry.
That's terrible.

51:54.578 --> 51:57.580
Well, you know,
the ocean is... teaches us all

51:57.615 --> 51:59.849
a lot of things
about ourselves.

52:01.150 --> 52:03.219
I was not prepared for this.

52:03.220 --> 52:06.655
Me neither.

52:06.656 --> 52:09.224
Four-headed shark.
Never hear of such a thing.

52:11.059 --> 52:13.328
-Yeah.
-But we'll get her.

52:13.329 --> 52:15.699
She's out there,
we'll get her.

52:15.700 --> 52:16.798
I hope so.

52:16.799 --> 52:18.501
Promise you.

52:32.414 --> 52:34.317
Any sign on that shark yet?

52:34.318 --> 52:35.818
Not yet.

52:36.885 --> 52:40.422
Well, here it goes.

52:49.699 --> 52:53.503
One down.
Nine to go.

53:13.655 --> 53:17.793
You think that speaker
will hold up underwater?

53:17.794 --> 53:20.295
It's supposed to be waterproof,
but just in case,

53:20.296 --> 53:22.998
I put them all
in a waterproof dive bags.

53:22.999 --> 53:26.468
And Captain Sterling has one
on the police vessel as well?

53:26.469 --> 53:28.838
Yeah, his vessel
has a built-in speaker.

53:30.273 --> 53:32.675
You know, I'm sorry.

53:32.676 --> 53:35.979
I really am.
I know all this is my fault.

53:37.079 --> 53:40.081
Yeah, well.

53:40.082 --> 53:42.417
We're all on the same team,
so all we can do now

53:42.418 --> 53:46.422
is just try
to make it better.

53:46.423 --> 53:47.824
I'm trying.

53:47.825 --> 53:52.028
I want you to know I know
I've been a real jerk.

53:52.063 --> 53:56.932
But it was all
for the aquarium.

53:56.933 --> 53:58.300
Yeah.

54:01.371 --> 54:06.443
I repeat, I want confirmation of the
mandatory shutdown of all coastal traffic,

54:06.444 --> 54:09.946
And all the beaches are to remain
on lockdown. Can you confirm this?

54:09.981 --> 54:15.250
<i>-Yeah, copy that.
-We can confirm.</i>

54:15.251 --> 54:17.718
Where are you, baby?

54:17.753 --> 54:21.857
-Do you think this will work?
-I hope so.

54:27.697 --> 54:30.532
This is Sterling.
Come in, Day Off.

54:35.436 --> 54:38.306
-Day Off here.
-Any signs of the shark?

54:38.307 --> 54:39.741
Yeah, we're almost set here.

54:39.742 --> 54:41.377
We got one more buoy
and we gotta put the bait

54:41.412 --> 54:43.211
in, and we're good.

54:43.212 --> 54:45.882
Okay, copy that. Let me know
if there's any sightings.

54:45.883 --> 54:49.184
Copy that, over.
All right, see this?

54:49.185 --> 54:52.054
We're coming up into the mouth
of the inlet right here.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.757
All right, if this is gonna
work, now is the time, okay?

54:54.758 --> 54:57.726
Get those dolphin sounds going.
Let's go, girl.

54:58.594 --> 54:59.829
See you in a little bit.

55:15.510 --> 55:17.413
Okay, that should do it.

55:19.782 --> 55:22.084
It's not
the nicest of sounds, is it?

55:22.119 --> 55:24.420
No wonder sharks hate it.

55:24.421 --> 55:29.324
All right, this should draw the
shark directly into the inlet.

55:29.325 --> 55:32.160
Right where we want it to go.

55:32.161 --> 55:35.664
Okay, that's it.

55:35.665 --> 55:37.666
Okay, we're all good.
Let's set that trap.

55:53.282 --> 55:54.784
There she is.

55:54.785 --> 55:58.820
-It looks like it's just
two miles away. -Yeah.

55:58.821 --> 56:00.688
The dolphin noises is keeping
it from the coast,

56:00.689 --> 56:03.025
but it's just going
the wrong way.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.127
Let's circle around
and cut it off right here.

56:06.528 --> 56:09.733
Great. Sounds like a plan.

56:22.710 --> 56:25.514
-Yep. This is it, right here.
Okay. -Yeah.

56:25.515 --> 56:29.585
-It's go time, kid. Lay that
bloodline, let's go. -You got it.

56:33.588 --> 56:35.123
All right, here we go!

56:35.124 --> 56:37.426
Time to set the trail.

56:54.309 --> 56:58.047
Hey, Cait,
you want to give me a hand?

56:58.048 --> 57:01.684
It'll help you get
your mind off of things.

57:01.685 --> 57:03.887
I can't do this.

57:05.688 --> 57:08.588
She was my best friend.

57:08.623 --> 57:10.326
I'll miss her too,
but we have to keep going.

57:10.327 --> 57:14.931
I mean, that's only thing that
we can do, is just keep going.

57:17.632 --> 57:18.967
Trust me.

57:25.775 --> 57:29.711
-Okay. Let's do this.
-Okay.

57:31.079 --> 57:32.848
All right, let's go.

57:49.065 --> 57:50.030
There he is.

57:50.065 --> 57:52.668
-Yep.
-He's getting closer.

58:00.543 --> 58:04.480
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

58:08.884 --> 58:10.552
Okay, there he is.

58:10.553 --> 58:13.355
Let's get that bait
up and rolling, guys.

58:13.356 --> 58:15.724
Here we go.

58:15.725 --> 58:17.159
What is that?

58:17.160 --> 58:21.396
It's mammal fat.
It attracts the sharks.

58:21.397 --> 58:22.931
Just like the women, with me.

58:22.932 --> 58:25.634
Ain't that right, sweet pea?

58:25.635 --> 58:28.771
-All right, here, give me that.
-What's that?

58:28.772 --> 58:31.007
These are depth charges.

58:31.008 --> 58:34.344
Look out.
And another one.

58:34.345 --> 58:37.780
Don't worry, they don't go off until
20 feet after the shark eats them.

58:40.516 --> 58:42.218
Is this seriously
going to work?

58:42.253 --> 58:43.918
Is it gonna work?

58:43.919 --> 58:46.422
The only other alternative
is live bait.

58:46.423 --> 58:49.391
-Want to try it?
-No, no, no, no, that's all.

58:49.392 --> 58:51.393
Yeah, that's what I thought.

58:51.394 --> 58:53.128
All right, Yo.
Here we go.

58:53.129 --> 58:56.264
Time to get dirty.
Grab that. Yeah.

58:56.265 --> 58:59.601
Okay, now, grab the anchor line, please.
Thank you.

59:12.081 --> 59:16.184
-What happened?
-Maybe the sonar tag fell off.

59:16.185 --> 59:18.253
It was just on the screen.

59:21.791 --> 59:24.227
Maybe we should turn on
the dolphin sounds.

59:24.262 --> 59:25.694
No, no, no, no.

59:25.695 --> 59:26.862
No, it needs to be
in the east side of us

59:26.863 --> 59:28.764
so we can drive it toward
the inland.

59:28.765 --> 59:32.602
Come on. Come on.

59:34.702 --> 59:36.139
I can't see him.
Do you have anything?

59:37.972 --> 59:39.741
No, no, no, no.
It's not here.

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.934
-Something's not right.
-Come on, where are you?

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.371
Where are you,
you son of a... where are you?

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.315
Wait a second.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.887
Do you have it?
Can you see it?

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:28.157
-No. -I can't see it.
It's not here.

01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:40.369
There's nothing here.

01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:50.112
I'm getting something here.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.958
Wait. It's right under us.

01:01:18.706 --> 01:01:20.942
Angie!

01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:26.214
No!

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.350
No!

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.384
Mayday. Mayday.
I have visual of the shark.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.119
<i>He's right on me.</i>

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.222
<i>Mayday. Mayday.
I have visual of the shark.</i>

01:02:08.223 --> 01:02:09.858
<i>Sterling, where is he?</i>

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:13.128
He's... he's right on me.

01:03:25.099 --> 01:03:28.503
Damn it.

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.438
No, no, no.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:41.918
Mayday.
Mayday, please! Please!

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.452
I've lost engine power.
Red, can you hear me?

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.221
Stay calm.
Stay calm, all right?

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:49.758
I need you to get the shark
to swim toward me somehow.

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:51.526
The shark is circling me now.

01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:55.063
<i>Wait till it gets east.</i>

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.931
Okay, when it gets east,
that's when you release

01:03:56.932 --> 01:03:59.267
the dolphin sounds.

01:04:01.603 --> 01:04:04.806
<i>Okay, Red, just give me
a second.</i>

01:04:26.027 --> 01:04:29.130
Come on.
Come on, come on.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.128
Yes. Yes.

01:05:03.565 --> 01:05:07.869
It worked. It worked.
It's headed east now. Kill it!

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.539
-Kill it, Red!
-Copy, all right. Over.

01:05:28.722 --> 01:05:32.527
-There it is. Coming our way.
-It's working!

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:38.401
Hey, everybody on point.
It's coming our way now, guys.

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:56.050
The shark, it's coming
right into the inlet.

01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:57.385
It must smell the blood trail.

01:05:58.786 --> 01:06:01.522
Hey, let's get this bad boy
in the water. Hey, hey!

01:06:01.523 --> 01:06:03.925
Give me that teaser line out there.
Let's go.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:07.295
Aye, aye, captain.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:10.032
And listen, let me know when you
see anything. We're all set here.

01:06:21.976 --> 01:06:24.278
Wait, Red.

01:06:24.279 --> 01:06:26.215
The shark, it stopped.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:29.084
What do you mean,
"It stopped"?

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.385
Hold on, where is it?

01:06:31.386 --> 01:06:33.320
That doesn't
even make any sense.

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:35.156
It should be going toward
the chum line.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.142
Cait, go downstairs
and help 'em out, okay?

01:06:37.177 --> 01:06:39.127
Go downstairs
and get that chum out there.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:42.064
Keep an eye on it and let me
know what you see, okay?

01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:56.679
Yo, let me know when something
pops up on there, okay?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.713
Okay.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.193
This isn't working.

01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:16.730
What you mean
it's not working?

01:07:16.731 --> 01:07:19.535
This is why they call it fishing,
not catching, all right?

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:26.574
-Anything on the monitor?
-Nothing.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.486
How's this lined doing
over here?

01:07:39.253 --> 01:07:41.123
Now, this part
of the problem right here.

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:45.760
This thing is all the way back.
Yeah. It's quiet.

01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:52.701
You sure this shark bait
trick is going to work?

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.271
Patience, all right?

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.341
This is the calm
before the storm, guys.

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:01.941
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:05.213
How long is this going to take?
I'm not doing so well.

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:10.219
I don't know, man. Relax, give me a
break, okay? I'm gonna catch a shark.

01:08:12.153 --> 01:08:15.190
Why they call you Red?

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.890
Yeah, why do they
call you Red?

01:08:20.528 --> 01:08:22.863
You really want to know why
they call me Red?

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.000
Spear fishing.

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:27.770
Off the Channel Islands.
Got a yellowtail on the line.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.406
Start reeling them in. Pulling them
like this. All of a sudden, boom!

01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:32.439
Back of my head,
I get hit by a hammerhead.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.442
Pull out my dive knife,
I start stabbing him.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:35.573
I fight him the best I can.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:38.511
I work my way back
to the boat,

01:08:38.513 --> 01:08:40.314
crawl up, I'm bleeding
all over the place.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:43.050
My scalp's hanging off.

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:46.388
The guys were a pretty salty
crew and they're, like,

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.689
"What's up, Red?"

01:08:48.788 --> 01:08:53.528
But, I won.
So, there you have it.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.365
What,
you don't believe me?

01:08:58.366 --> 01:09:00.402
You're the shark hunter.

01:09:01.868 --> 01:09:05.907
Yo, Thaddeus, you all right? Hey!
Thanks for the show, buddy.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.377
You okay?

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.513
Let me get
that line back out.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.193
There!

01:10:01.128 --> 01:10:02.264
I think I see see something.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.667
What is it?

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.468
It's definitely there.

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:08.938
It's moving fast.

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:13.442
How fast?

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.444
Very.

01:10:27.088 --> 01:10:28.823
I think it's circling us.

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:31.426
Circling us?
Hold on.

01:10:36.097 --> 01:10:38.166
It's coming!

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.337
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.
It's time. Game on.

01:10:45.172 --> 01:10:47.041
I saw it.
There it is.

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:48.510
There it is.
A fin!

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:53.279
Wait, is that it?
Is that our shark?

01:10:53.314 --> 01:10:56.116
Look out, you guys. Look out,
you guys, coming through.

01:10:56.117 --> 01:10:58.686
Is that the one?

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.956
Don't know, we've only
seen it's fin.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.632
All right, hang on a second.

01:11:13.434 --> 01:11:15.003
Hey, where did it go?

01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:38.694
There it is,
there it is, it just took it.

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:48.904
All right, this is gonna be big.
You ready, guys?

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:53.274
Here we go.
In three, two, one.

01:12:04.252 --> 01:12:07.155
Holy crap.

01:12:09.323 --> 01:12:12.027
-Did it work?
-Did it work?

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.531
Guys, we killed it.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:19.168
Yes!

01:12:22.069 --> 01:12:23.671
We did it!

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:26.907
-Everybody!
-Great job, Red.

01:12:26.908 --> 01:12:29.378
Nice job.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:43.391
Guys? Please tell me
you just saw that?

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.592
Yeah, I did.
I just saw that.

01:12:45.593 --> 01:12:48.195
That's a fin.
It's not dead.

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:49.530
Do something.

01:12:54.668 --> 01:12:56.270
What's going on?

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:58.372
Go! What the hell do
you think I'm doing?

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.675
I'm trying to get
out of here.

01:13:02.409 --> 01:13:04.011
Why aren't we moving?

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.614
Man, We got a problem.
We got... he took out the prop.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.118
So, we're just sitting ducks?

01:13:12.253 --> 01:13:14.055
Sterling. Sterling,
this is Day Off.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.356
<i>Requesting vessel assist
right now.</i>

01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:18.426
<i>We got a problem.</i>

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.695
Come in.
This is Sterling, come in.

01:13:21.696 --> 01:13:23.064
<i>Sterling, shark took out
our prop.</i>

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.065
We're in trouble out here.
We need some help.

01:13:25.066 --> 01:13:26.902
<i>Man, that's one
smart shark.</i>

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.404
It did the same to me.
Hang in there, buddy.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.089
I'm doing all I can.

01:13:31.124 --> 01:13:32.774
Okay, copy that.

01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:41.716
We need to get
the hell out of here now.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.085
I didn't pay you to make us
all shark happy meal.

01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:50.525
Where is it?
Can anyone see it?

01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:55.831
Ram, you and Thaddeus
gather up all the chum left.

01:14:13.548 --> 01:14:14.682
Cait!

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.123
Cait!

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.063
Cait! Ram, help her!

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:42.610
Guys, hurry!

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.818
Come on!

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.820
Come on, swim faster!

01:14:55.355 --> 01:14:58.025
Come on!
Come on, you guys, okay!

01:15:03.163 --> 01:15:04.765
Hurry, hurry!

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.072
-Come on!
-Go!

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.712
I got it!
I got it! Did you see that?

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:23.118
I got it!
I killed that freaking shark.

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.520
Come on.

01:15:26.787 --> 01:15:29.757
Thaddeus Young!
I got it!

01:15:34.462 --> 01:15:35.764
Crap.

01:16:16.604 --> 01:16:21.443
Mayday, mayday! I need a
helicopter to the inlet right now.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:24.179
Day Off is stranded.
They need help.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.280
We need to search
and rescue right away.

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.981
Do you copy that?

01:16:27.982 --> 01:16:30.685
<i>Copy.
Dispatching helicopter now.</i>

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:34.055
<i>All right.
Come in, Day Off.</i>

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:36.023
Sterling, this is Day Off.
Come in, over.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:39.261
Red, I'm sending
a helicopter right now.

01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:42.430
He'll be there shortly.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.699
<i>You're going to have to hold off
the shark till it gets to you.</i>

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.135
Copy that.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:48.802
Hey, guys,
they're sending in the chopper.

01:16:48.803 --> 01:16:50.939
We gotta hold it off till then.
Let's go.

01:17:00.047 --> 01:17:02.282
All right.

01:17:02.283 --> 01:17:04.352
You guys ever use one
of these before?

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.954
-No.
-No?

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.560
What you do, you rack it,
point it.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.162
Shoot it.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.896
Here you go.

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:19.367
Here you go, pal.

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.636
Rach, it's for you.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.688
What about the dolphin sounds?

01:17:23.723 --> 01:17:25.740
We don't have another speaker.

01:17:27.641 --> 01:17:30.077
Well, you gotta go old school.

01:17:34.814 --> 01:17:37.719
<i>Search and rescue on the roof
to location chaos.</i>

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.255
<i>Please await
visual confirmation.</i>

01:18:02.176 --> 01:18:05.477
Where did it go?

01:18:05.512 --> 01:18:08.283
The sonar only picks up
a diameter about 100 feet.

01:18:11.585 --> 01:18:13.689
It's coming back.

01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:18.725
All right, on the count of three,
when I tell you to fire, we fire.

01:18:18.726 --> 01:18:19.960
You ready?

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:24.599
One. Here it comes.
Two, three. And fire!

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:43.784
Where is he?
Do you guys see it?

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:46.086
Check the sonar.

01:18:46.087 --> 01:18:49.855
-I don't see it.
-Hey, maybe we got it.

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:53.961
You know, I think I shot it a few times.
Maybe we killed it, you know.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.194
I don't think
a shark like this

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:58.466
gonna be scared off
by a couple of bullets.

01:19:00.167 --> 01:19:01.836
<i>We have a visual confirmation</i>

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.371
<i>of the Day Off.</i>

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:04.905
<i>Going in.</i>

01:19:06.474 --> 01:19:08.409
Red, do you hear that?

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.345
Thank God!

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.188
Yeah, over here!
Hey, hey!

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:22.423
Hey! Hey!

01:19:31.265 --> 01:19:32.367
No!

01:19:34.068 --> 01:19:36.804
No!

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.038
No.

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:39.974
Did that just happened?

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:47.881
What do you see?

01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:51.418
All I see is something big.
It's probably the helicopter.

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:02.797
Is it dead?
Did the explosion kill it?

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.298
I don't know.
It might of.

01:20:05.299 --> 01:20:08.703
There's nothing
on the monitors.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.071
Maybe we got it.

01:20:13.207 --> 01:20:17.445
I highly doubt it, kid.
I highly doubt it.

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:31.859
Sterling, this is Day Off. Sterling,
this is Day Off. Come in, over.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.895
Sterling here.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:35.563
Did the rescue helicopter
arrive?

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:40.033
<i>-Are you safe?
-Yeah, we're safe.</i>

01:20:40.034 --> 01:20:41.501
Shark's dead.

01:20:41.502 --> 01:20:44.039
Is the helicopter there?

01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:48.542
Unfortunately,
the chopper went down.

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:51.313
I'm sorry
about that, man. Over.

01:21:06.793 --> 01:21:09.497
Red, come take
a look at this.

01:21:12.466 --> 01:21:14.268
What's up?
What do we got?

01:21:19.974 --> 01:21:22.844
No, no, no!

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:25.310
It's moving.

01:21:25.345 --> 01:21:27.815
I knew it. Something
my gut was telling me.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.583
What else do we have
to kill this thing?

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:33.387
I don't know, I just got a
couple of depth chargers.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:37.158
That's it.
Here we go.

01:21:38.525 --> 01:21:41.595
-Didn't I tell ya. Throw
it in the water. -Yeah.

01:21:42.796 --> 01:21:45.532
Wait, what are you
gonna do?

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:49.770
I'm gonna kill
the son of a bitch.

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.806
I'm gonna tell you to start
chumming, all right?

01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:54.875
Get ready, you guys.
Here we go.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.177
All right.

01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:11.159
All right, where are you?

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:18.166
There he is.
Throw it in now, Ram.

01:22:37.984 --> 01:22:39.320
It's coming right at us.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:47.729
Yeah, I see it.
It's right there!

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.975
There you are,
you dirty bastard.

01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:36.743
Where is it?

01:23:36.744 --> 01:23:40.681
It's moving away from us.
I'd say bout 50 feet.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.182
I don't see Red, though.

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.282
Red!

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:16.818
My God.

01:24:44.244 --> 01:24:46.247
Did you miss me?

01:24:52.019 --> 01:24:54.689
You son of a bitch.

01:24:59.426 --> 01:25:02.596
Good job.
Way to go.

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:12.806
Do you want to get married?

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:16.009
You'll have to go vegan.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.645
All right.
