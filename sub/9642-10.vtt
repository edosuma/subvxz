00:00.375 --> 00:03.000
Previously on
Wizards of Waverly Place:

00:03.000 --> 00:06.083
Oh, big deal, I stole something
that grows from the ground.

00:06.083 --> 00:08.291
Maybe you should find out
what's going on.

00:08.291 --> 00:09.625
And how am I
gonna do that?

00:09.625 --> 00:11.583
Maybe you should talk
to some Guardian Angels.

00:11.583 --> 00:14.583
I'm Tina, a Guardian Angel
in training.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.583
Oh, my gosh.
That's Rosie.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.416
Wait, wait.
How do you know her?

00:18.416 --> 00:21.833
- Rosie's an Angel
of Darkness now.
- What?!

00:21.833 --> 00:24.208
Is that the mighty instrument
used to influence good or bad

00:24.208 --> 00:26.000
throughout all worlds
in the universe,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.333
also known as
the Moral Compass?

00:28.333 --> 00:30.458
Yes. Why are you asking?

00:30.458 --> 00:32.458
Because I'm gonna steal it.

01:34.458 --> 01:37.833
Enjoy your wings,
fallen wizard,

01:37.833 --> 01:42.208
as we cast our shadow
on Earth.

01:45.958 --> 01:49.458
Wow.

01:49.458 --> 01:52.125
Hey, think I can get one of
those glowy-hand thingys?

01:52.125 --> 01:54.750
I said no more.

01:54.750 --> 01:58.958
I'm sorry, but the sandwich
was a little dry.

01:58.958 --> 02:02.125
Oh, no, I'm sorry, sir, that
you didn't enjoy your sandwich.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.166
So, you think you can make
a better one, you jerk?!

02:08.166 --> 02:11.375
Yeah. Anybody can put
cardboard between bread!

02:12.708 --> 02:15.708
Hey, wait.
Let me lube it up for ya.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.458
Yeah!

02:21.166 --> 02:23.458
Oh, that's hilarious.

02:23.458 --> 02:26.625
That is not hilarious.
That's mean.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.583
Alex, stay focused.
We need to find your brother

02:29.583 --> 02:31.708
before Rosie gets him
to steal the Moral Compass.

02:31.708 --> 02:34.000
I don't care about
my brother anymore.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.583
Hey, why don't we plop down
with a bag of something fried

02:36.583 --> 02:38.750
and watch people on the Internet
pretend they can sing.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.500
Oh, no!

02:42.500 --> 02:46.833
You're acting bad, and
your parents are acting bad.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.708
This can only mean one thing.

02:48.708 --> 02:51.583
Justin already got
the Moral Compass to
the Angels of Darkness

02:51.583 --> 02:53.458
and they've changed it
from good to bad.

02:53.458 --> 02:56.000
I'm not turning bad,
you little twerp.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.625
Alex, listen to me.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.625
You're being influenced
by dark forces.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.375
You have to fight it,
so we can save

03:02.375 --> 03:04.083
your brother Justin
from the Dark Realm.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.750
You know what,
I am tired of you

03:06.750 --> 03:09.000
yakking in my ear
all day long,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.708
with your perky
little voice, OK?

03:11.708 --> 03:14.208
There is no point in
trying to help Justin,

03:14.208 --> 03:17.375
or anybody in this
dark world now, so just go.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.708
- Alex, no.
- Go.

03:19.708 --> 03:22.625
Just do that annoying flapping
thing with your mouth and go.

03:26.291 --> 03:29.208
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

03:29.208 --> 03:32.125
Come on, Maxine.
Everyone else did it.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.375
Pretend it's Zac Efron
and kiss the pillow!

03:39.500 --> 03:42.000
No, wait.
I've got a better idea.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.875
- Punch Zac Efron!
- Yeah!

03:44.875 --> 03:47.458
Punch! Punch! Punch!
Punch! Punch! Punch!

03:48.416 --> 03:50.583
This slumber party is lame.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.000
I don't want to hang out
with these squealing girls.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.375
I want to hang out
with guys my age.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.250
News flash: This slumber party
was really for me.

03:58.250 --> 04:01.583
So, why don't you go
hang out in the kitchen
with the rest of the dips.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.583
Punch! Punch! Punch!
Punch! Punch! Punch!

04:04.583 --> 04:07.000
That's it.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.375
Stop these cries, turn
these girls into older guys.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.375
Hey, they're supposed
to be ninth graders,

04:17.375 --> 04:19.250
not one-hundredth graders.

04:25.416 --> 04:30.000
So, my bad brother,
what's on the agenda? Hmm?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.208
Steal? Lie?

04:33.208 --> 04:35.250
Spit off the roof?

04:37.708 --> 04:39.958
A little dry.
Why don't you go first.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.416
Your wizard is...
interesting.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.833
Yes, very interesting.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.833
And cute.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.458
I meant interesting
as in "strange."

04:56.000 --> 04:58.583
Nonetheless,
you've done well.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.291
You shall be rewarded.

05:00.291 --> 05:05.000
You can be the one who decides
how he will be destroyed.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.750
Destroyed?
What do you mean?

05:07.750 --> 05:09.333
That was never
part of the plan.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.458
Of course it was.
He's an outsider.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.583
But he brought you
the Compass as you asked.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.000
Just let him go.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.250
Let him go?

05:19.250 --> 05:21.500
Is that sympathy?

05:23.166 --> 05:26.208
You're not becoming weak,
are you?

05:26.208 --> 05:29.416
Like the Guardian Angel
you once were?

05:29.416 --> 05:30.958
No.

05:30.958 --> 05:35.500
You are
an Angel of Darkness.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.458
Do not betray me!

05:46.875 --> 05:48.500
My Rosie.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.583
I haven't even thanked you
for showing me

05:50.583 --> 05:53.333
the evil of my good ways.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.625
Does that make sense?
I think it does.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.500
Justin, we have to
get out of here now.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.833
- Please.
- Why?

05:58.833 --> 06:01.250
Because...

06:01.250 --> 06:02.583
I care about you.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.208
But we can just stay here
forever, just like you said.

06:05.208 --> 06:06.708
Justin, we have to leave now

06:06.708 --> 06:09.958
because Gorog is
going to destroy you.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.625
Gorog won't destroy me.
He needs me.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.750
No, he's used you
and now he's done.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.833
- Please, let's go.
- No.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.500
I'm never going back.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.125
I'm no longer a wizard.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.416
I'm an Angel of Darkness.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.166
Thanks to you, I now know
where I belong.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.083
What have I done?

06:48.416 --> 06:50.250
Shh, shh!

06:50.250 --> 06:52.416
Alex, I need your help.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.583
Whatever it is,
I don't have time.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.958
I have a slumber party
to go to.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.125
This bag of angry badgers
and six obnoxious little girls

07:00.125 --> 07:02.125
are about to have
a screaming contest.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.000
Alex, your brother is
being held by Gorog.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Shh!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.333
Gorog?

07:08.333 --> 07:11.208
That sounds like a boost
you put in your smoothie.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.166
"Excuse me, I'll have
the Strawberry Dazzle

07:13.166 --> 07:15.000
with a vitamin C
and a shot of Gorog."

07:15.000 --> 07:17.208
- I'm funny.
- No.

07:17.208 --> 07:20.708
Alex, Gorog is the leader
of all the Angels of Darkness.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.291
He's going to
destroy your brother.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.875
Then why did you
bring Justin to him?

07:24.875 --> 07:28.416
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.
I was tricked, too, Alex.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.458
Oh, you'll have to do
so much better than that

07:33.458 --> 07:34.833
if you want to
outlie a liar.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.875
No, Alex, I'm telling
the truth. I promise. Please.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.833
This was all Gorog's plan,
and I followed it,

07:40.833 --> 07:44.708
but I never expected to
fall in love with Justin.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.458
Hold on. Are...
Are you crying?

07:49.458 --> 07:52.333
I thought you were
an Angel of Darkness.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.000
You're starting
to sound good.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, I guess that's what
falling in love does to you.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.875
Alex, please.
There isn't much time, OK?

08:00.875 --> 08:02.583
Do the right thing
for your brother.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.583
I know there's still
some good left in you.

08:04.583 --> 08:07.500
No, there isn't. Wait.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.458
There it is.
A little piece of good.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.250
Darn it!
Here, hold this.

08:13.375 --> 08:17.208
Oh, no. Alex!

08:27.000 --> 08:29.500
Hey! Guardian Angels!
Come on!

08:29.500 --> 08:33.125
I need your help. You have
to help me save my brother!

08:33.125 --> 08:36.708
Come on! Break time's over.
What's going on?

08:36.708 --> 08:37.875
Calling all angels.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.291
We've got some
Dark Realm butt to kick.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.708
You're too late.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.875
The Moral Compass
has been set to bad,

08:43.875 --> 08:46.375
so Guardian Angels
are powerless.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.875
I can't even scratch my own
wings. Can you get it, dear?

08:49.875 --> 08:52.583
Where's Tina?

08:52.583 --> 08:55.833
She went to the Dark Realm
to get the Moral Compass

08:55.833 --> 08:57.708
and help your brother.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.375
She went by herself?

08:59.375 --> 09:00.958
She's not gonna
stand a chance.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.833
Then, I guess it's on me.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.333
Tina's got some
back-up coming.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.083
Oh, wait, wait!

09:08.083 --> 09:11.000
Wizard powers are weak
in the Dark Realm.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.125
If you have any chance
of saving your brother,

09:13.125 --> 09:14.625
you'll need wings.

09:14.625 --> 09:18.375
We keep an extra pair
in case of an emergency.

09:19.833 --> 09:22.958
Oh, my gosh! Awesome!

09:24.625 --> 09:25.708
What do these do?

09:25.708 --> 09:28.583
Do they shoot like,
lasers and stuff?

09:28.583 --> 09:30.875
No, they're just wings.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.416
You'll need them to
get to the Dark Realm.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.083
Oh. OK.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.083
You know what's good for
emergencies? Lasers.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.750
You know what's not?
Feathers.

09:41.708 --> 09:44.000
Well, I'll still
look cute anyway.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
So, Gorog.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.333
Now that I've
broken my wand,

09:54.333 --> 09:56.375
that's proof that I'm
totally committed to you.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.750
Is there an Angel
of Darkness handbook?

09:58.750 --> 10:01.000
Because I'm not quite sure
if my shirt should be tucked,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.750
or untucked. I mean,
untucked does seem badder,

10:03.750 --> 10:05.375
but I can see
that you're tucked.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.458
What's going on?

10:09.458 --> 10:11.333
Oh, you'll soon see.

10:11.333 --> 10:15.333
You brought me
the Moral Compass,
so I'm done with you.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.416
No, no, no, Gorog!
Wait, please! Listen to me!

10:22.458 --> 10:25.875
No need to be afraid of
heights, if you're an angel.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.833
Of course, if you're
an angel with no wings,

10:28.833 --> 10:31.208
then you have a problem.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.458
No, no, no!
Not my wings!

10:35.875 --> 10:38.416
How can you do this?
I brought you everything
you wanted.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.125
Stop!

10:40.125 --> 10:43.750
Leave Justin alone and give us
back the Moral Compass.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.750
It's ours.

10:48.166 --> 10:51.125
OK. You can laugh now,

10:51.125 --> 10:53.458
because I'm about to
make all y'all cry.

11:11.875 --> 11:15.416
Gorog, let me dispose
of this pest and prove
my loyalty to you.

11:15.416 --> 11:18.125
And if you let me live,
I swear I'll always guard
the Moral Compass.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.083
Hmm.

11:20.083 --> 11:23.958
Yes. I can see the
possible value in that.

11:23.958 --> 11:27.000
An Angel of Darkness
committed to keeping

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
the Moral Compass
in the Dark Realm.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.458
Proceed.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.333
Wait! No, Justin,
I'm here to save you.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.000
Maybe you should be
saving yourself.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.458
Let her go!
Brakes.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.708
Where are the brakes
on these things?!

11:38.708 --> 11:40.750
To your right!

11:43.458 --> 11:46.708
I know it doesn't look like it,
but I'm here to help you.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.083
No.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.166
Let him prove himself.

11:52.166 --> 11:56.125
Justin, you're not
an Angel of Darkness.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.416
You're a wizard,
a good wizard.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.375
You know in your heart
you don't belong here.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.000
And neither does
that Moral Compass.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.416
I'm not leaving.

12:05.416 --> 12:07.708
Well, then I'm gonna
take this back with me.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.250
No! Give it!

12:19.250 --> 12:21.375
Turn the arrow, Alex!
Turn the arrow!

12:23.708 --> 12:24.708
Yes!

12:36.250 --> 12:39.875
OK, Grandpa.
It's your turn
to kiss Zac Efron.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.750
Jerry, what's
going on in here?!

12:49.750 --> 12:52.583
Hey, everybody, stop!
Right now!

12:54.166 --> 12:55.708
Give us those pillows!

13:06.291 --> 13:09.458
- Justin, you're breaking it!
- No, I'm not. You are.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.125
- No, look, you're
cracking it.
- What?

13:12.375 --> 13:14.291
Stop her!

13:14.291 --> 13:16.500
Don't you mess
with the wizard!

13:21.708 --> 13:23.208
Give that back to me.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.458
What? My wand!

13:37.125 --> 13:38.708
Rosie?!

13:38.708 --> 13:39.750
No more!

13:39.750 --> 13:41.708
I'm sorry I did this
for you!

13:41.708 --> 13:44.958
Angels of Darkness
never feel sorry.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.125
She does now!

13:55.875 --> 13:58.708
Oh, dear. What a mess.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.375
Oh, Mom.
I'm really sorry.

14:04.375 --> 14:07.000
I promise I'll pay for a new
pillow with my allowance.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.250
What happened to
the little girls from
the slumber party?

14:11.250 --> 14:16.375
I got mad and turned them
into old guys. Sorry.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.125
That's all right.
I'm sure it was an accident.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.125
Just turn them back
into little girls

14:21.125 --> 14:23.208
and I'm sure everything
will be all right.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.625
Or, we could turn them
into something else.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.083
Like fruit.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.583
Perfect.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.416
I'll make them into one of
my signature fruit hats.

14:36.416 --> 14:39.250
The fruit flies
ate my last one.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.125
Turn them into talking fruit.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.125
I want to hear them
beg me not to eat them.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.750
Fruity pa-tootie.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.583
I want to go home!

15:00.583 --> 15:02.375
This party stinks.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.000
Let it go!

15:16.000 --> 15:19.458
Hold on, Alex! I'll take
Justin down with the halo.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.458
He threw it.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.208
Give it to me! Stop it!

15:28.208 --> 15:30.416
I'm serious, give me
the Compass, Alex!

15:30.416 --> 15:32.458
Give it here!

15:32.458 --> 15:33.875
Justin!

15:33.875 --> 15:35.875
No!

15:45.875 --> 15:47.083
I've got it.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.458
No, I've got it.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.291
Now, give me
that Moral Compass

15:52.291 --> 15:55.458
or you'll never
see her again.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.291
Not if I turn it to good.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.708
My allegiance
lies with Gorog.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.291
The Dark Realm prevails!

16:11.291 --> 16:13.083
Justin, don't!

16:13.083 --> 16:17.250
Justin, I'm so, so sorry
for everything that's happened.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.833
I pretended to
fall in love with you

16:18.833 --> 16:21.583
to carry out Gorog's plan,
but along the way,

16:21.583 --> 16:24.583
you touched my heart
and you made that love real.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.500
You love me?

16:27.583 --> 16:31.458
Justin, give it to me.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.375
Take this to the Guardian
Angels. I'll be fine.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.833
OK.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.708
No!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.708
Rosie...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.375
You have betrayed me,

17:11.375 --> 17:14.208
and forsaken the Dark Realm.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.333
Get out!

17:19.250 --> 17:22.708
I'm gonna go to,
if that's OK with you.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.458
I'm sorry. It's hard
to have a soft landing

17:32.458 --> 17:33.625
with a broken wand.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.166
Look, Justin.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.000
I totally deceived you

17:40.000 --> 17:42.583
and I don't even deserve
to be here with you right now,

17:42.583 --> 17:44.375
but if you can forgive me,

17:44.375 --> 17:46.708
I'd love for us
to start all over.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.500
Of course I forgive you.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.375
Oh, I'm so glad.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.000
But we can't be together.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.708
What? Why?

18:00.958 --> 18:03.125
Rosie, everything
we've been through

18:03.125 --> 18:05.875
has made me
realize something.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.458
The world is a fragile place.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.250
It's always teetering
between good and bad.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.000
Look how easy it was for me
to forget what's right.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.875
Of course I want
to be with you.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.375
But the world needs another
Guardian Angel more.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.458
You are such a good person.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.875
But Justin, I don't think
I have what it takes

18:28.875 --> 18:31.458
to be a Guardian Angel again.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.750
Hey, you saved me.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.166
When the whole world turned bad,
you stayed good.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.625
Because of you.

18:42.958 --> 18:44.833
Rosie, I will miss you.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.625
I'll miss you, too.

18:52.875 --> 18:56.208
Hey, do me a favor.
Every once in awhile,

18:56.208 --> 18:59.125
do something a little bad
so I have a reason
to come visit.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.583
OK.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.458
Bye.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.458
Oops.

19:24.708 --> 19:28.458
Sorry. It felt like
the right time to sing that.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.958
Alex and Tina,

19:30.958 --> 19:34.208
you went where
no Guardian Angel
dared to go,

19:34.208 --> 19:37.250
and returned the Compass
to its rightful place,

19:37.250 --> 19:41.000
saving the world from an
indefinite age of darkness.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.208
For this incredible
bravery, Alex,

19:43.208 --> 19:44.583
you can keep the wings
we gave you.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.375
Oh. Um, good,

19:47.375 --> 19:49.583
because I don't think you're
gonna want these back.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.583
Now, Tina,
for your part,

19:55.583 --> 20:00.166
I hereby promote you to
official Guardian Angel.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.416
And there's someone here who
wants to congratulate you.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.458
Rosie, you're back!

20:16.125 --> 20:17.166
My wings!

20:17.166 --> 20:19.583
Congratulations, Tina!

20:19.583 --> 20:23.958
They smell
brand new!

20:23.958 --> 20:28.125
Can my first assignment be
to watch over Alex Russo?

20:28.125 --> 20:30.875
No, no. I will be good.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.583
I promise, OK?

20:32.583 --> 20:34.875
This is the first time I've
ever said that and meant it.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.250
Don't follow.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.583
Excuse me.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.083
Guardian Angel Dispatch.

20:45.083 --> 20:48.708
She's done something bad
already?!

20:48.708 --> 20:51.458
All right, Tina.
You're up.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.291
Yes!

20:53.291 --> 20:55.458
Excuse me! Pardon me,
excuse me!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.416
Justin.

21:07.708 --> 21:10.708
What are you doing
still up? It's late.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.416
I stayed up because
I owe you something.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.583
I found it in
Washington Square Park.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.875
A two-headed dog had it.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.583
I'm pretty sure he didn't
start out that way.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.958
Thank you.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.625
What about your wand?

21:28.625 --> 21:31.291
I, uh...

21:33.708 --> 21:36.708
I'll find a spell
to fix it.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.208
And I owe you
something else.

21:44.583 --> 21:47.708
Thank you for saving me.

21:47.708 --> 21:51.708
It's for all the times
that you saved me

21:51.708 --> 21:53.958
when I wasn't so good.

21:53.958 --> 21:56.291
And for a couple more times
in the future, so we're even.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.583
No, we're not.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.458
You saved the world today.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.208
You gave up a girl
to protect it.

22:07.583 --> 22:11.125
Why do we have to keep
dealing with stuff like this?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.750
We're wizards.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.583
I don't think
we have a choice.
