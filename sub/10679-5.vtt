WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.919
You need to leave us alone!
You need to go away!

00:03.920 --> 00:06.319
- She's drinking, isn't she?
- That's why I rang you.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.159
I don't know why
she's started again.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.439
I knew Vicky Fleming.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.599
- Don't you think you should
tell the police?
- You don't know what that does to me.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.279
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Ana Vasalescu,

00:16.280 --> 00:17.679
Aurelija Petrovic...

00:17.680 --> 00:19.359
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

00:19.360 --> 00:21.599
- Who's it from?
- It's from your dad.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.199
He wants you and me shouting!
He wants you to hate me!

00:24.200 --> 00:27.359
When has doing anything legally
got anybody like me anywhere?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.040
You're going to have to do what
I've asked you to do.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.919
That's wonderful!

00:36.920 --> 00:43.759
Every day was a misogynistic delight
from start to finish.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.079
The best thing when I joined up -

00:46.080 --> 00:49.319
this is like 300 years ago,
in the 1980s -

00:49.320 --> 00:52.759
you didn't get a truncheon
if you were a woman,

00:52.760 --> 00:54.159
you got a handbag!

00:54.160 --> 00:57.239
- Thanks(!)
- No, you did get a
truncheon. You got one of them,

00:57.240 --> 00:59.519
you know, little doodah things.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.719
That's right, yeah!

01:00.720 --> 01:05.679
Like a vibrator. A handbag
and a vibrator. Great!

01:05.680 --> 01:07.199
What you gonna do with that

01:07.200 --> 01:10.319
when someone's coming at you with
an Uzi and a machete?

01:10.320 --> 01:13.319
They were big enough to keep
a brick in, them handbags.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.599
- Just!
- So, you were a police officer?

01:16.600 --> 01:20.359
I was, yeah. 30 years and
then I come back as a civvy.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.919
God knows why.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.039
Well...

01:24.040 --> 01:26.639
God does know why.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.359
And skirts. There were no trousers.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.079
You don't know you're born, you lot.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.999
We used to freeze our knackers
off on a night shift.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.719
Ooh, and do you remember,
"Stockings or tights?"

01:38.720 --> 01:41.759
You'd run the gauntlet every time
you walked through t'CID office.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.479
They'd have their hands up
your skirts,

01:43.480 --> 01:46.679
twanging your suspenders to see
if you were sharp or flat.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.839
And you just took it!

01:48.840 --> 01:49.959
You had to.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.839
Although. Although. Leonard Stott.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.919
Inspector up at Brighouse.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.759
He used to come up to me,
every time he saw me,

01:58.760 --> 02:01.519
he used to come up to me like this.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.759
"Oooh, Cathy!" He used to call me
Cathy. "It's Catherine, you twat."

02:04.760 --> 02:09.279
"Oooh, Cathy," and I was like,
"Whatever," for long enough

02:09.280 --> 02:12.719
and then one day, I just thought,
"Bollocks to this,"

02:12.720 --> 02:15.759
and the next time he did it...
Right in his face

02:15.760 --> 02:17.439
and I floored him. I decked him

02:17.440 --> 02:20.359
and I'd only been out of
training school four weeks,

02:20.360 --> 02:21.959
but he never did it again.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.719
- In fact, he used to avoid me
after that.
- No shit.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.959
We're doing tequilas, us lot.
You joining us?

02:28.960 --> 02:31.120
- Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah!

02:32.520 --> 02:34.879
You go home if you're knackered.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.600
Nah, I promised Nev
I'd look out for her.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.360
Has she said owt?

02:42.480 --> 02:44.679
She's bereaved!

02:44.680 --> 02:46.520
It's been what, four weeks?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.520
It's the sort of thing you can
appear to be coping and then...

02:56.800 --> 03:01.719
Best thing we can do is show her
we care and keep an eye on her.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.000
Where is she?

- Why?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.479
Are you sure about this?

03:44.480 --> 03:45.919
Yeah. Honestly.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.640
You can have my bed. I'm still
camped out in the conservatory.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.479
- You're such a fantastic human being,
Catherine.
- I know.

04:01.480 --> 04:07.199
I know I'm pissed, but do you know
what I think God is?

04:07.200 --> 04:11.199
I think... God... is like this...

04:11.200 --> 04:14.560
this collective goodness
that's in all of us.
- Yeah.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.918
Yeah.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.199
And someone like you...

04:21.200 --> 04:26.399
it's like you have so much of this
goodness, this...

04:26.400 --> 04:27.720
bigness.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.800
It's like you embody what... God is.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.120
OK. Now then.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.600
- Ann.
- Hm.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.759
Did you...

04:49.760 --> 04:53.119
shag... that bloke?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.080
Yeah.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.320
Did I?

04:59.280 --> 05:03.240
Did he use... a condom?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.880
- Mm.
- Are you on the pill
or anything?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.520
I can see two of you.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.160
Omnipotent and ubiquitous.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.079
God, I'm good.

Right, Sean. Last time we saw you...

06:44.080 --> 06:46.639
Last time we met,
we had a conversation...

06:46.640 --> 06:49.920
Before we start...
there's something I want to say.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.159
That's absolutely fine, Sean.
What would you like to say?

06:56.160 --> 06:59.039
There's two questions you've asked
me that I've said no comment to

06:59.040 --> 07:00.359
and I want to comment now.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.359
And then there's something else
I want to say.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.640
OK.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.039
You asked me...

07:08.040 --> 07:11.999
what I'd say if you told me
you'd found some...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.039
somebody's DNA in my van.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.399
Ana Vasalescu.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.080
Well, I don't know her, but...

07:19.520 --> 07:21.439
...if she's a prostitute...

07:21.440 --> 07:24.599
I do... pick 'em up now and again,
and she could've been one of them...

07:24.600 --> 07:26.239
'..and that's the only reason

07:26.240 --> 07:28.639
- 'I can think of as to why it'd be
there.
- Good. Well, '

07:28.640 --> 07:31.919
- thank you for that, Sean.
That's helpful.
- And then...

07:31.920 --> 07:36.199
And then there's th-that other
one's number in my phone.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.079
- Lynn, er...
- Lynn Dewhurst.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.480
I don't know her.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.760
As such.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.319
I think...

07:45.320 --> 07:47.559
I think I helped shift some
furniture for her

07:47.560 --> 07:49.199
a couple of years ago as a favour.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.679
She was a friend of a friend
and I had a van, so...

07:51.680 --> 07:53.160
I didn't know her!

07:54.320 --> 07:56.159
But...

07:56.160 --> 07:59.039
I don't remember doing, but maybe
I just took her number in case

07:59.040 --> 08:02.359
there were any problems, I couldn't
find the house or whatever, and then

08:02.360 --> 08:04.999
- I never deleted it, cos I never
delete numbers, do you?
- No.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.359
So who's this friend you were
doing the favour for?

08:08.360 --> 08:11.839
I ain't seen him lately.
He was called Eggy.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.399
Has he got an address?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.639
He won't be there now,
it's all derelict.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.400
- What's his proper name?
- I only ever knew him as Eggy.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.559
Right.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.839
And where were you shifting
this furniture to and from?

08:24.840 --> 08:28.919
Somewhere up... Pellon,
from a flat in Halifax.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.919
Can you remember a street name,
where she lived?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.759
I don't know round there.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.198
- What type of property was it?
- A terrace.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.519
Describe it to me.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.759
It was just ordinary.
It's been three years since.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.759
So you don't remember
a house number?

08:41.760 --> 08:43.839
It was just a settee
and an armchair!

08:43.840 --> 08:45.959
It were only ten minutes of a job,
about three f...

08:52.480 --> 08:54.760
About three years ago.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.000
So what's this other thing you
wanted to say to me, then, Sean?

09:11.160 --> 09:15.799
I'm worried that...
because I drink a lot,

09:15.800 --> 09:18.040
I don't always remember stuff
what's happened...

09:19.320 --> 09:22.919
...and I-I don't believe that
I did kill those women...

09:22.920 --> 09:25.599
but perhaps I've got...

09:25.600 --> 09:28.479
perhaps I've got so drunk that
I've done stuff and...

09:28.480 --> 09:30.400
and I-I don't remember doing it.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.879
- 'Look, I'm just trying to be
as honest with you as I can be.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.464
'I'm pretty sure something like that
you would remember,
however off your head you was.'

09:45.960 --> 09:48.240
But if it... if it was me...

09:49.960 --> 09:52.240
...I honestly have no memory of it.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.280
You do realise that isn't a defence
though, don't you, Sean?

10:03.920 --> 10:04.960
Yeah.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.719
Yeah, the problem is, Sod's Law,

10:15.720 --> 10:18.039
the night I decide not to
sleep in the conservatory,

10:18.040 --> 10:20.559
- something will happen.
- If them
Knezevics were going to do owt,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.319
- wouldn't they have done it by now?
- Probably. Possibly.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.519
That Goran bloke must've known
stuff Ilinka didn't know.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.439
That must be why
they went after him.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.439
Or else, they genuinely have
no idea where she is.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.639
How did you work that out?

10:34.640 --> 10:37.079
Because - duh! -
that's what you said.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.719
Oh, OK. Well, yeah. Yeah.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.159
I think you just like sleeping
in t'conservatory.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.399
Yeah, but, you see, now I'm
thinking, never mind the Knezevics,

10:45.400 --> 10:48.279
now I'm thinking that whoever left
that Scalextric is going to do

10:48.280 --> 10:50.919
something else,
something even more weird.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.159
Like what?

10:52.160 --> 10:53.999
I don't know. A brick through
a window.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.799
You see, I don't think a brick
through the window is as weird

10:56.800 --> 10:58.999
as leaving a present on your
doorstep, actually.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.119
And I don't think somebody
who'd leave a present

11:01.120 --> 11:04.319
on your doorstep would put a brick
through your window anyway, so...

11:04.320 --> 11:07.999
Yeah. No. Why?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.359
It wasn't an act of aggression.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.839
Oh, it was psychologically
aggressive.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.640
- Yeah, but not violent,
just weird.
- Yeah.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.159
Right!

11:20.160 --> 11:23.199
I'm gonna grab some clothes
and get dressed, and then...

11:23.200 --> 11:26.399
Morning, Mother!
Late night, was it?

11:26.400 --> 11:29.839
Hiya. Then I'm going to... Yes, it
was. And then I'm going to go

11:29.840 --> 11:33.199
and spend 150 quid that I haven't
got on the famous bloody toy

11:33.200 --> 11:36.639
that Ryan never asked for
in the first place.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.799
I must need my head examined.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.640
We've been saying this for years
behind your back. Haven't we, Clare?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.079
Ann Gallagher's upstairs,
just to warn you.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.999
Why, is she dangerous?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.040
Funny(!) You're so funny, Daniel(!)

11:54.040 --> 11:57.159
That solicitor wasn't happy,
was he? Did you see him?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.600
He stuck by him, though.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.799
Did you believe him?
What he said about Lynn?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.119
Well, it fits. Her number's there on
his phone,

12:08.120 --> 12:11.080
but it's not like there's
ever been any calls between them.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.120
Doesn't prove anything
though, does it?

12:16.160 --> 12:19.439
I still think that last one's
different.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.720
Vicky Fleming.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.640
OK.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.079
CPS says go for it. Charge him.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.559
- All four?
- We've got significant
circumstantial, he's on

12:31.560 --> 12:34.719
the sex offenders' register, he was
practically caught red-handed with

12:34.720 --> 12:37.159
Leonie Farrell, and now he's talking
to us he's telling us

12:37.160 --> 12:39.479
he's got no memory of anything
and no alibis.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.399
And they're saying that's good
enough for them to go to court with,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.239
so...

12:44.240 --> 12:46.799
looks like we might get
a bit of a weekend after all.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.280
So all four,
including Vicky Fleming?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.320
All four.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.440
Well done... team.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.439
I've got to caution you again now,
Sean, and tell you that you do not

13:09.440 --> 13:12.559
have to say anything, but it may
harm your defence if you do not

13:12.560 --> 13:15.399
mention now something which you
later rely on in court.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.120
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

13:19.360 --> 13:25.799
You are charged that, on or between
27th of April and 29th of April 2015

13:25.800 --> 13:31.279
- at Elland, murdered Ana Vasalescu
contrary to common law.
- I didn't...

13:31.280 --> 13:35.719
On or between 29th of May and
2nd of June 2015 at Brighouse,

13:35.720 --> 13:39.559
murdered Aurelija Petrovic
contrary to common law.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.239
On or between 23rd of July and
6th of August 2015 at Halifax,

13:44.240 --> 13:48.359
murdered Lynn Dewhurst
contrary to common law.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.279
On or between 11th of September
and 15th of September 2015

13:52.280 --> 13:56.800
at Brighouse, murdered Victoria
Fleming contrary to common law.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.479
Is there anything you want
to say, Sean?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.920
I didn't do it.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.800
149.99, please.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.320
Do you sell many of these?

15:01.960 --> 15:06.519
We have met before. It was me
mother's birthday, year before last.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.999
Do you remember?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.799
I got a bit pissed
and went off in a strop.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.279
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.440
So you...? You and your wife,
you've... split?

15:16.560 --> 15:19.200
Yeah. It's all a bit mad.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.240
Life is a bit mad though, isn't it?
Older you get.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.879
I think...

15:27.880 --> 15:32.959
looking back, I only married Lucy
to get away from here.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.399
I liked her. Y'know.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.119
I do like her.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.840
But everything has to be so neat and
tidy and nothing out of place.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.560
It's like living in a little
dolly house.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.759
Is that cos of what
happened with Becky?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.680
Wanting to get away from here?

15:53.800 --> 15:54.840
It was an odd time.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.520
After she died. Becky.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.600
Me mum did go a bit mental.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.759
Me dad couldn't stand it either.
He left.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.840
How old were you?

16:07.880 --> 16:11.720
20. She said some really stupid
things.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.200
But, you know, she was ill.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.840
I think she's fantast...

16:24.320 --> 16:25.360
Oh, God.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.880
What?

16:30.440 --> 16:33.840
I just remembered something
I said last night, to her.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.200
Moving on...

16:41.640 --> 16:44.160
How was last night?
Did it do the trick?

16:45.640 --> 16:46.680
What trick?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.279
Cheer you up.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.319
Cheer ME up?

16:51.320 --> 16:52.400
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.319
Have I put me foot in it?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.400
The bastards!

16:59.720 --> 17:00.760
You OK?

17:07.640 --> 17:11.319
It was silly what upset me. I
haven't told anyone. It was at work.

17:12.839 --> 17:17.118
This... bloke asked me out for a
drink. A detective.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.279
Nothing special,
old enough to be me dad,

17:19.280 --> 17:23.760
and I knew he was married and been
having an affair with someone else.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.839
But I quite liked him.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.439
It was the first time I'd thought
about... the possibility of...

17:34.440 --> 17:35.760
you know.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.920
Being close to someone.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.160
Since what happened to me.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.080
So it was a big deal.
Not that he knew that.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.440
Then...

17:51.960 --> 17:53.680
...he didn't turn up.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.760
So...

17:57.760 --> 17:58.920
Tosser.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.680
Yeah.

18:16.120 --> 18:21.359
- '..losing 20 pounds and having
great sex for the rest of your life,
tied with just 22%...'

18:23.640 --> 18:25.519
♪ Like Lady Godiva

18:25.520 --> 18:29.879
♪ I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me... ♪

18:32.920 --> 18:34.039
Jack!

18:34.040 --> 18:35.119
'Hiya.'

18:35.120 --> 18:36.479
It's me, Dad.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.519
'You all right?'

18:37.520 --> 18:42.119
Listen... Erm... I'm coming home.
Are you going to let me in?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.839
'Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'

18:43.840 --> 18:44.880
Cheers, mate.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.759
Cheers, pal.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.959
So! Hello. Good morning!

18:58.960 --> 19:00.680
How are we all?

19:02.280 --> 19:03.679
Good(!)

19:03.680 --> 19:06.639
So I've got a little proposal
I'd like to put to you.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.399
Contrary to what you think,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.319
I'm not the one who's been having
some sort of sordid little fling

19:11.320 --> 19:15.719
with some sad sod from Mirfield who
drives a Skoda - no, that'll be you.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.639
So what I'm proposing is,
YOU move out,

19:18.640 --> 19:21.719
you gather your bits and pieces,
you move in with loverboy,

19:21.720 --> 19:23.679
you feel free
to do whatever you have to do.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.119
I - me - the one who hasn't been
mucking about -

19:27.120 --> 19:31.359
will stay here, in our house, with
our children. How about that?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.799
I'm not leaving the children.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.639
Yeah. Well, newsflash.
Neither am I.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.359
And you're a liar. I know damn
well you've been up to something.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.639
OK, then. Who is this mysterious
whoever who I've been having this
relationship with, then? Eh?

19:41.640 --> 19:46.359
Where is she? Eh? She doesn't exist,
Amanda. She's in your head!

19:46.360 --> 19:52.119
And you really should get your facts
straight before you start
accusing people of things.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.719
Now go and pack your stuff and ring
Casanova. He'll be thrilled!

19:55.720 --> 19:59.519
You can set up home together.
That's the plan, isn't it?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.679
I assume that's the plan.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.439
Does Graham know that's the plan?

20:03.440 --> 20:04.799
Shut up!

20:04.800 --> 20:06.319
Oh! Does he not?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.999
Oh, does he not?

20:13.040 --> 20:16.839
Can we talk about this sensibly,
properly,

20:16.840 --> 20:19.039
not in front of the children?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.079
Perhaps I should go
and tell him, then.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.159
Perhaps I should keep him informed.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.559
Perhaps I should knock his
teeth down his throat.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.639
Where you going?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.719
Mirfield.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.039
You don't know where he lives.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.439
I'm a detective, love.
I know bloody well where he lives.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.319
Feel free to ring ahead and warn him
that I'm on my way.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.799
If he's not in when I get there,
I'll ask his wife to pass on a
message. How about that?

20:37.800 --> 20:40.159
No. Don't do that! John! Don't!

20:40.160 --> 20:42.520
What, does she not know either?

20:43.520 --> 20:48.919
So it's just you that thinks the
two of you's slinking off into the
sunset together, is it?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.479
I shan't be long, kids.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.559
Dad!

20:51.560 --> 20:53.240
Shan't be long, tiddler!

20:54.840 --> 20:55.999
Why did you let him in?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.639
It's his house too, he lives here
as well!

20:58.640 --> 20:59.680
Shit!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.439
How many seconds?

21:09.440 --> 21:10.839
I didn't even bother to count.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.159
You're supposed to count!

21:13.160 --> 21:15.399
- Two and a half?
- It was nearly a minute!

21:15.400 --> 21:16.599
And the rest!

21:16.600 --> 21:18.200
I'll have to do it again now.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.839
Good morning!

21:20.840 --> 21:21.999
Granny!

21:22.000 --> 21:23.119
Hi!

21:23.120 --> 21:25.399
Count how long I can balance!

21:25.400 --> 21:26.759
Did you sleep all right?

21:26.760 --> 21:29.079
- Granny!
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Sorry.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.479
I'll drive you home in a bit.
Have you had some breakfast?

21:31.480 --> 21:32.720
Just had some coffee.

21:34.920 --> 21:39.159
Well, I got it. 149.99.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.440
I don't want it.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.039
What are you talking about?

21:45.040 --> 21:46.439
I'll have it!

21:46.440 --> 21:47.919
What d'you mean, you don't want it?

21:47.920 --> 21:50.319
- I mean, I don't want it.
- Why?
- Because it's not the same.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.999
It's exactly the same. Only
we know where this one's come from.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.079
I wanted that other one.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.079
Well, you couldn't have that other
one, and I promised I'd replace it.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.360
I wanted the one me dad sent.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.279
He's not your dad.
I've explained this.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.559
Yeah. But he is.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.079
Why don't I go and set it up?

22:09.080 --> 22:11.319
And you go ring Cesco to come round
and have a race.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.599
We'll have a championship.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.639
No.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.759
I'll set it up.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.279
No, if he's not going to play with
it, I'll get my money back.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.600
- He'll play with it.
- I shan't.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.919
Sorry.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.119
It's fine.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.239
Oh, it's ridiculous.
It's impossible.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.199
You need to find out who
put it there.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.359
I will, I'm going to.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.479
Bastard.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.160
Don't get me started.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.479
I'm sorry
if I was talking shite last night.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.400
No, you weren't. You were happy.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.079
Oh, I got you this.
From the chemist.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.279
What is it?

23:12.280 --> 23:13.440
Morning after pill.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.119
Oh, Jesus.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.719
I mean, I don't know that you need
it, I don't know what you did,
but I just thought...

23:19.720 --> 23:20.799
Thanks.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.959
- You know.
- Yeah.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.159
- Just in case.
- How much do I owe you?

23:24.160 --> 23:28.319
It's fine, it's nothing, it's a
present. Except you do know,
just for future reference,

23:28.320 --> 23:31.719
if anyone'd seen you, it would've
been a Public Order offence
at the very least,

23:31.720 --> 23:33.759
and you'd have lost your job.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.840
Shit, can you answer that?

23:41.760 --> 23:45.959
Hello, Catherine's phone? She's
driving, she's just dropping me
home.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.479
Yeah, all right, bye.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.599
She says, can you pop up to the
allotment after you've
dropped me off?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.000
Deep joy(!)

24:08.480 --> 24:10.279
So what's up?

24:10.280 --> 24:16.879
Well, I've been expecting Neil all
morning but he's not shown up.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.319
I knocked on his door on my way
down, no answer,

24:19.320 --> 24:21.479
I've phoned him,
I've texted him, nothing.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.079
And it's odd cos
we were reckoning to spend

24:24.080 --> 24:25.639
the day on the allotment together.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.879
He'll have forgotten.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.119
It's not like him.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.239
- I wouldn't know.
- Why don't you like him?

24:30.240 --> 24:32.279
It's only lunchtime.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.799
He's a really nice man.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.039
So what wants doing?

24:36.040 --> 24:37.719
I've got all these planks to shift.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.319
Jerry at far end said
he'd have 'em.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.679
Well, can't Jerry at far end come
and fetch 'em?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.080
He's in hospital.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.600
Hey. They've charged that fella.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.959
Sean Balmforth. This morning.
It's been on t'radio.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.159
They've charged him wi' them
murders.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.399
Wow.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.960
I know.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.799
You all right?

25:04.800 --> 25:07.639
I bought our Ryan that Scalextric
and he reckoned he didn't want it.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.159
"I wanted that one me dad sent me."

25:09.160 --> 25:11.719
I've said it till I'm blue
in the face, "He's not your dad."

25:11.720 --> 25:13.440
And he goes, "Yeah, but he is."

25:15.080 --> 25:16.720
It'll never go away, will it?

25:19.400 --> 25:24.079
When I find out which sad, twisted
sod left that on our doorstep...

25:24.080 --> 25:26.480
I'll make
'em wish they'd never been born.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.320
- Nice weekend?
- Yourself?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.639
Have you heard owt from Gravesend?

26:50.640 --> 26:53.399
Yes! I did. Late on Friday night,
they sent a list.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.999
Visitors, phone calls,
people he writes to.
I can't let you see it.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.159
You being funny?

26:58.160 --> 27:00.639
No. I can't have you taking
the law into your own hands.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.999
- What, Friday night and you didn't
let me know?
- I've forwarded the list
to an analyst in the DIU.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.399
He'll gather intel on all of 'em,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.199
and as soon as we know anything
significant, I'll get back to you.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.600
You know that's the right way
forward, Catherine,
don't start pulling faces.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.519
Woman in the toy shop in Hebden
last week buying a Scalextric.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.519
Exactly the same model.

27:19.520 --> 27:23.279
I went in and asked the fella
behind the counter on Saturday
and he showed me his CCTV.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.519
Looks like a lad.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.359
Yeah, well, it's a woman,
the fella said.

27:26.360 --> 27:30.439
- Either way, it doesn't mean it's
whoever it was left it on your
doorstep.
- No, I know that,

27:30.440 --> 27:33.119
but was there anyone on the list
from round here?

27:33.120 --> 27:34.839
No.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.159
Not?

27:36.160 --> 27:38.280
No. Not from round here.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.839
Are you briefing t'troops?

27:42.840 --> 27:45.759
Yes, I am. Are you saying,
"Well done, Catherine"?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.919
What for this time?

27:46.920 --> 27:50.239
Sean Balmforth. Charged.
That was me got him arrested.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.879
Oh! Yes, but...

27:51.880 --> 27:54.399
They're playing it down
till it's confirmed,

27:54.400 --> 27:57.519
but there's another body
turned up in Rastrick.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.199
When?

27:59.200 --> 28:01.559
Early hours this morning.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.999
And depending on when she died...

28:04.000 --> 28:06.320
it could mean they've charged
the wrong fella.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.319
- Sorry!
- Mornin'.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.759
Oh, congratulations! He's been
charged, you'll have heard.
That fella you tipped us off about.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.439
Oh, have you not heard?
Apparently another body's turned up.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.959
Did you not know?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.320
It's what I've just been told.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.799
Good morning, you lucky people...

28:55.200 --> 28:56.240
(Bollocks.)

28:57.640 --> 28:59.479
Really?

28:59.480 --> 29:01.120
(Shit.)

29:05.360 --> 29:08.519
She thinks she's not been dead
more than 48 hours.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.599
She'll be more specific
at the postmortem,

29:10.600 --> 29:13.359
but it's looking like she died after
we had Sean in custody.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.400
- Oh, f...
- I know.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.880
Could it be a copycat?

29:31.040 --> 29:34.520
Well, again, we'll know more
after the PM, but...

29:42.040 --> 29:46.399
So, we'll be getting
the review team in.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.959
And to restore public confidence
in the investigation,

29:48.960 --> 29:53.360
I'll be getting my arse kicked
down the stairs in the traditional
manner, no doubt, by your dad.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.600
I can only apologise.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.000
Who is she?

30:04.600 --> 30:08.120
White. Between 20 and 30.
Poor teeth, poor clothes.

30:13.880 --> 30:18.639
You know, the only thing I'd have
done differently from you
on Saturday...

30:18.640 --> 30:20.599
I'm sorry, do you want to hear this?

30:20.600 --> 30:23.480
You wouldn't have charged him
with Vicky Fleming.

30:31.360 --> 30:36.200
"'I'm sure that dog's getting
bigger by the minute, ' said Dad.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.679
"Ben and Albert laughed.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.800
"'If only Dad knew.'"

30:43.880 --> 30:47.079
You're doing so well.
Ben and Albert!

30:47.080 --> 30:49.239
They remind me of you and Cesco.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.599
How?

30:50.600 --> 30:52.399
Just, you're best friends.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.639
Oh, yeah.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.719
Do you and Cesco do sleepovers?

30:55.720 --> 30:57.559
I used to love sleepovers!

30:57.560 --> 31:00.079
That's the best thing
about a best friend.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.119
- Sometimes we do.
- Yeah? Have you got one planned?

31:03.120 --> 31:04.159
No.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.560
Why?

31:09.400 --> 31:10.720
How're things at home?

31:14.360 --> 31:17.279
You know, if you ever want to
talk to me,

31:17.280 --> 31:20.080
about anything, Ryan,
you know you can.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.159
Other day...

31:25.160 --> 31:26.640
at teatime...

31:27.760 --> 31:32.440
...I said I wondered if we should
forgive him - me dad.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.639
But they wouldn't talk about it.
They just get cross.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.839
Who does?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.159
Me granny. And me Auntie Clare.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.959
And I've been worried, because...

31:44.960 --> 31:47.919
you know when you said they don't
get much money in prison...?

31:47.920 --> 31:49.160
Yeah...

31:50.520 --> 31:52.199
Ryan?

31:52.200 --> 31:55.679
Do you think... he gets
enough food to eat?

31:55.680 --> 31:59.279
Do you think he's warm enough
at night when it's cold?

31:59.280 --> 32:02.359
Oh, yes, yes, yes! I'm sure he is.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.039
You mustn't worry about that, Ryan!

32:04.040 --> 32:06.119
Oh, you're so sweet and kind
to think about that.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.079
I know he hurt me granny
and everything,

32:09.080 --> 32:12.079
but he's still me dad.

32:12.080 --> 32:16.519
Yeah. I think the worst thing
about prison probably is,

32:16.520 --> 32:19.519
he might get lonely sometimes.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.839
And bored.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.519
Have you ever thought
about visiting him?

32:23.520 --> 32:27.080
I'm not allowed. There's no
contact cos of what he did.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.120
I bet he'd love to see you.

32:31.680 --> 32:35.319
I wonder if that's another reason
why he sent you that lovely present?

32:35.320 --> 32:37.199
I wondered...

32:37.200 --> 32:39.919
about writing to him.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.239
You should.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.119
I don't know his address.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.120
Oh, I think you could just
put his name, and then...

32:48.320 --> 32:50.639
Um... Oh, um...

32:50.640 --> 32:53.079
Where is he? What prison is he in?

32:53.080 --> 32:55.319
Do you know?

32:55.320 --> 32:58.520
Oh... I think I heard
that he's in, um...

32:59.920 --> 33:01.959
...Gravesend Prison.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.959
- Gravesend?
- Yeah.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.399
Where's that?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.800
It's near London.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.119
'Bravo November 4-5. Could you
look at log 271 of today -

33:22.120 --> 33:23.719
'down in Sowerby Bridge?

33:23.720 --> 33:26.159
'There's a fella kicking off
outside The Moorings.'

33:26.160 --> 33:28.879
I can look at it, Mr Metcalfe,
but I've got no-one to deploy.

33:28.880 --> 33:32.399
They're all off on the
house-to-house with this body
that's turned up in Rastrick.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.399
'It's all started with
a plate of chips,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.200
'and it's escalated from there.

33:37.280 --> 33:41.159
'I don't suppose I could persuade
you to turn out yourself, 4-5?'

33:41.160 --> 33:43.199
Well, I was just about to make
myself a cup of tea

33:43.200 --> 33:46.159
and put my feet up for the
afternoon, but seeing as it's you...

33:46.160 --> 33:48.599
'So he's been ejected from
the premises, we've got

33:48.600 --> 33:51.599
'CCTV monitoring him now, he's
in the street with his top off,

33:51.600 --> 33:53.919
'banging on the doors,
trying to get back in.'

33:53.920 --> 33:57.639
Oh, lovely - a semi-naked man
at lunchtime in Sowerby Bridge,

33:57.640 --> 33:59.360
how could I stay away?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.639
Get out here, you little runt!

34:10.639 --> 34:12.319
Come on, get out here!

34:12.320 --> 34:13.998
You TWAT!

34:14.000 --> 34:16.478
Come on, you short-arsed bastard!

34:16.480 --> 34:18.359
Open this door!

34:18.360 --> 34:20.438
Hey!

34:20.440 --> 34:21.600
Neil?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.438
Where've you been?

34:24.440 --> 34:26.159
What you doing here?

34:26.159 --> 34:27.559
Bravo November 4-5.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.438
I'm code six, I don't need any
backup, I know this fella.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.319
Oh, you won't need any backup?
Is that what you think?

34:33.320 --> 34:36.478
Well, you're not going to cause me
any problems, are you, Neil?

34:36.480 --> 34:39.319
I was just explaining
to this tosser...

34:39.320 --> 34:40.998
Open the fucking door!

34:41.000 --> 34:43.319
Can you calm down?

34:43.320 --> 34:45.079
Make 'im open the door.

34:45.080 --> 34:48.039
You're causing a disturbance
and you're upsetting people.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.600
- Where's your top?
- No, I'm not!

34:52.120 --> 34:54.438
Rat-face! Open this door!

34:54.440 --> 34:57.199
If you don't calm down, I'm warning
you, you'll get locked up.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.839
Do you understand?
I've warned you now, Neil.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.839
Can you get your jumper back on
for me, please?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.479
They've got me telephone.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.159
Who's got your telephone?

35:06.160 --> 35:08.479
THEM! In there!

35:08.480 --> 35:11.759
Is that your telephone
on the pavement, over there?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.159
Eh?

35:13.160 --> 35:14.280
Down there.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.320
- Oh.
- Can you pick it up for me?

35:25.640 --> 35:28.039
Is that your telephone?

35:28.040 --> 35:30.799
- Is that your telephone, Neil?
- YES!

35:30.800 --> 35:33.839
He's been in here stealing food
off people's plates.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.119
You bloody liar.
Why would I do that?

35:36.120 --> 35:39.319
People don't want your dirty great
fingers in their chips!

35:39.320 --> 35:42.159
It was a bit o' fun!
It was her birthday!

35:42.160 --> 35:44.719
I've asked him to leave,
I've made it clear

35:44.720 --> 35:47.519
he wasn't gonna be served any more,
and he just won't clear off.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.479
- I'm dealing with it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

35:49.480 --> 35:52.839
- And you can tell him he's barred.
- Yes, I will, I'm dealing with it,
thank you.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.839
BARRED? It's a shit-hole anyway!

35:55.840 --> 35:58.239
You're barred, all right?
You're barred.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.519
Oh, yeah - rock hard, stood behind
a little police lady.

36:01.520 --> 36:04.559
If you could go back inside for me,
please.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.079
Yeah, piss off back inside,
you little sod.

36:07.080 --> 36:10.559
I don't want to hear any more
language, Neil - I've warned you.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.039
I want to know he's understood.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.519
It would help me enormously, sir,

36:13.520 --> 36:15.919
- if you would go back inside
the premises.
- You...

36:15.920 --> 36:18.759
You're not welcome in these
premises at any point in the future.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.239
Oh, go and fuck yourself
up the arse.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.920
You fuck yourself up the arse!

36:28.320 --> 36:31.279
Hands behind your back, Neil.
I'm arresting you, do you
understand?

36:31.280 --> 36:32.359
You're hurting me!

36:32.360 --> 36:35.639
- You're being arrested...
- You're HURTING me!
- ..for Section 5 Public Order.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.679
- You do not have to say anything...
- You hate me!
- That's not true, Neil.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.719
- Any excuse!
- You do not have to say
anything...

36:40.720 --> 36:43.439
First time you saw me,
you talked to me like shit.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.839
Well that's fine and dandy,
cos I'm not right fond o' you.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.759
- You've had too much to drink,
and you need to be listening not talking.
- You're loving this!

36:49.760 --> 36:52.959
...but it may harm your defence -
believe me, I'm not -
if you do not mention

36:52.960 --> 36:54.879
- when questioned...
- AAAAAAARGHHH!

36:54.880 --> 36:57.399
...something you later rely on in court.
- AAAARGHH!

36:57.400 --> 37:00.359
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence. Do you understand?

37:00.360 --> 37:02.599
- Do you understand that, Neil?
- Piss off!

37:02.600 --> 37:04.199
Right, come on, get up.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.319
Dozy sod.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.839
I've asked you to go back inside
three times, now go inside.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.919
Come on, Neil. Get up.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.880
Come on.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.919
That pavement's gonna get very
chilly if you stay there

37:18.920 --> 37:22.960
much longer, and you do know it's
where the doggies do their wee-wees.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.839
How drunk?

37:26.840 --> 37:27.999
'I would say...'

37:28.000 --> 37:30.119
three days' worth.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.520
He was pretty whiffy.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.679
'Oh, good grief...'

37:34.680 --> 37:36.959
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, love.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.959
He were upset about something.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.160
Last few times I saw him, and...

37:42.240 --> 37:43.800
Damn.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.759
He'll just get a fixed penalty
notice.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.639
There's no reason why he'll lose
his job if he can pull himself

37:50.640 --> 37:52.559
back together and stay that way.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.879
'Custody Sergeant's going to
phone me when he's sober

37:54.880 --> 37:56.199
'and we can pick him up.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.039
'It'll be a good few hours though,
it'll be later this evening.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.839
'What was he upset about?'

38:00.840 --> 38:02.559
Oh...

38:02.560 --> 38:05.399
Just summat to do with
when his marriage broke down.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.839
'OK.'

38:06.840 --> 38:09.039
Well, I'll see you in a bit.

38:09.040 --> 38:13.559
Yeah, OK, I'll, um...
Yeah, I'll see you in a bit.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.280
'Ta-ta.'

38:51.520 --> 38:53.520
When you're ready!

38:55.040 --> 38:56.719
Thanks. Um...

38:56.720 --> 38:59.639
Most of you will know
Superintendent Gillespie.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.559
He's heading up the review team.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.479
Before we go through
everything with Mr Gillespie,

39:04.480 --> 39:07.439
there's a few bits and pieces
from this afternoon.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.959
We've got an ident on the victim.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.959
She's Elise May Hughes.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.639
20 years of age.

39:14.640 --> 39:18.759
Address - 27 Conway Crescent,
Dewsbury.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.439
Last seen three days ago.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.760
After we arrested Sean Balmforth.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.000
Yep, so... Shush!

39:27.440 --> 39:30.399
The pathologist is telling me
she's confident it's the same

39:30.400 --> 39:33.399
killer as... Well, certainly
the first three victims.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.599
And Vicky Fleming, if we accept
that he was disturbed before

39:36.600 --> 39:38.999
he'd finished doing what he wanted
to do to her.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.639
Although I think now more than ever,
we'd be wise to keep an open mind.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.479
The good news - for once! -

39:45.480 --> 39:47.879
is we might have a bit of a lead.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.919
The night Elise May Hughes' body
was left at the site in Rastrick,

39:50.920 --> 39:54.319
200 yards away, just further along
the road that same night,

39:54.320 --> 39:58.119
a parked vehicle was hit by
another vehicle. Hit and run.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.399
I've got forensics onto it, it won't
be long before we can identify the

40:01.400 --> 40:04.759
make and the model based on
fragments left on the vehicle
that was hit.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.719
I want to know who was
driving that vehicle.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.520
At the very least,
they may have seen something.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.880
Daryl?

40:29.800 --> 40:31.480
I made you some tea.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.840
Thanks.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.519
They let that fella go.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.879
The one they arrested.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.920
It's been on t'news.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.400
Except I think he's in custody
for something else, now.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.719
They're looking for the driver
of a red vehicle.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.919
They know it was red, cos it hit
another one... Left marks.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.440
Near where it happened.

41:18.760 --> 41:21.399
They think he might have
witnessed something.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.720
The driver.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.399
They say it's only a matter of time
before they work out

41:29.400 --> 41:32.080
the make and model,
if he doesn't come forward.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.959
I think cos of the marks.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.000
So?

41:38.440 --> 41:40.639
So you better get your tale
straight.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.039
About how you damaged your car.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.639
If they come asking.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.959
Why would they?

41:45.960 --> 41:49.399
Well, them two coppers were up here
before, weren't they?

41:49.400 --> 41:54.039
It's not me asking, it's not
something I'M interested in.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.039
I'm just thinking ahead.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.279
You don't want them to think
YOU did it, do you?

41:58.280 --> 41:59.839
Why would they think it's me?

41:59.840 --> 42:02.520
Well, apart from the car,
no reason at all, love.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.599
Except they arrested the wrong fella
once, they could do it again.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.919
And as I say,

42:09.920 --> 42:13.880
they think this person might have
witnessed something, so...

42:18.720 --> 42:20.239
Where did it happen?

42:20.240 --> 42:21.359
What?

42:21.360 --> 42:23.319
Your bump. This was up Rastrick.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.400
I don't even know where Rastrick is.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.000
Tell me about me mum.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.719
What about her?

42:42.720 --> 42:44.360
When she went out with me dad.

42:46.600 --> 42:50.079
I don't think they ever went out,
as such.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.359
I think she just used to hang out.
In the town.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.600
With this group of...

42:55.760 --> 42:57.399
...people, and...

42:57.400 --> 42:58.679
But they had me.

42:58.680 --> 43:01.039
Well, your MUM had you.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.240
He was long gone.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.520
To prison?

43:06.280 --> 43:07.760
Did she love him?

43:08.920 --> 43:12.519
She was... infatuated with him.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.959
What's that mean?

43:13.960 --> 43:17.039
She thought she was in love
with him,

43:17.040 --> 43:19.520
but she didn't know what
he was really like.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.999
And he took advantage of her.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.119
What does that mean?

43:25.120 --> 43:26.400
Had her on.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.000
How?

43:34.080 --> 43:35.680
I don't think she...

43:38.360 --> 43:40.199
She was just a bit young.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.839
To get pregnant.

43:41.840 --> 43:44.119
She was 18.

43:44.120 --> 43:46.200
17. When she got pregnant.

43:48.200 --> 43:53.200
And it doesn't matter how old you
are - if you're not ready for it,
you're not ready for it.

43:56.360 --> 43:59.000
- Shall we have a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.200
Is that why she died?

44:03.280 --> 44:04.760
Cos she wasn't ready?

44:07.680 --> 44:09.039
What's Granny said?

44:09.040 --> 44:11.639
She said that she died
when I was born,

44:11.640 --> 44:13.479
but it wasn't my fault.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.520
No. No.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.320
Well...

44:19.360 --> 44:21.039
Sometimes it just happens.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.120
Yeah.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.600
How're you feeling?

44:51.480 --> 44:54.359
Clare's outside.
Public aren't allowed in here.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.760
Well, not unless they've...

44:59.800 --> 45:01.679
You can speak to me, you know, Neil.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.720
I know what alcohol does to people,
I see it every day.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.919
I know you're not like that.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.880
I mean, I know you don't want
to be like that.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.760
I'm sorry.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.720
Come on.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.679
Have you fallen off the wagon
before, since you've been dry?

45:27.680 --> 45:29.400
Twice.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.560
OK, well...

45:34.720 --> 45:37.280
...you tell me what I can do
to support you.

45:38.920 --> 45:42.199
You know yourself best, you know
your habits. What do you need?
What can I do?

45:42.200 --> 45:44.639
Catherine, I just want to go home,

45:44.640 --> 45:47.079
want to get a shower,
get rid of this headache,

45:47.080 --> 45:49.000
get back to normal,
put it behind me.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.439
Did you ring in sick at work?

45:53.440 --> 45:54.999
You didn't just go AWOL?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.240
I took three days off.

45:57.240 --> 46:00.880
You see, when I know the way
things are going - up here...

46:04.520 --> 46:06.360
...I plan ahead.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.040
(Right.)

46:21.760 --> 46:24.279
Well, just... I don't know what
triggers you, and I'm sorry

46:24.280 --> 46:26.479
if you've got something upsetting
you at the minute

46:26.480 --> 46:27.519
that's sparked it off.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.959
But Clare's vulnerable too,
and she's my priority,

46:29.960 --> 46:32.839
and I won't watch her get
dragged down. Not by anyone.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.199
I'm sorry if you think
I've not been very friendly.

46:35.200 --> 46:38.239
I am sorry. She's very fond of you
and I want to respect that,
all right?

46:38.240 --> 46:39.880
But please don't mess her about.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.200
I won't.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.999
Three days?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.799
What, and then he can just stop?

47:21.800 --> 47:23.239
I don't know.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.799
D'you think it's good for her?
Being with someone who's the same?

47:26.800 --> 47:28.999
What can I do? She's grown up.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.919
You think they'll be all right
together on their own in his flat?

47:32.920 --> 47:35.759
I mean, it isn't five minutes since
she... fell off the wagon, is it?

47:35.760 --> 47:36.879
No, they're coming here.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.639
He's gone to tidy himself up,
then they're going to an AA meeting

47:39.640 --> 47:41.599
in Halifax, then they're coming
here.

47:41.600 --> 47:46.319
That WOULD worry me. If ever they
did decide to move in together.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.639
It wouldn't have till today, but,
my God, you should have seen him.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.719
Is this mental?

47:51.720 --> 47:53.599
What?

47:53.600 --> 47:55.479
Three days, he's been pissed.

47:55.480 --> 47:57.799
Disappeared, God knows where.

47:57.800 --> 48:01.160
And then another one of these women
has been murdered.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.680
Why would you think that about him?

48:06.760 --> 48:10.079
- He's really uncomfortable
around you.
- Yeah, I know,

48:10.080 --> 48:11.680
but that could just...

48:12.920 --> 48:15.160
...be my effortless
overwhelming charisma.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.440
Yeah, and that, obviously.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.079
It IS mental.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.439
I know it's mental.

48:22.440 --> 48:25.239
When the Ripper was around,
everybody was thinking it was

48:25.240 --> 48:28.759
their husband and their son
and their dad and their uncle.

48:28.760 --> 48:31.240
Yeah, but... It's someone.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.239
And the other thing.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.719
Ryan was asking about Becky.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.360
After you went out.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.320
About her relationship with...

48:44.440 --> 48:45.720
...him.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.919
I didn't say owt. I just said
she was infatuated

48:49.920 --> 48:53.119
and she didn't really know what
he was like, but it struck me -

48:53.120 --> 48:55.559
it's when he gets home from school.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.559
That's when he's got a new thing,
a new question,

48:58.560 --> 49:01.079
like someone's put ideas
in his head.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.759
At school?

49:02.760 --> 49:04.120
Yeah.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.080
Mum?

49:27.560 --> 49:28.960
Mum?

49:30.480 --> 49:32.160
Mum.

49:38.520 --> 49:41.359
Mum, I need to talk to you, Mum.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.440
What's the matter?

49:45.960 --> 49:47.120
I don't feel so well.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.399
What is it?

49:50.400 --> 49:51.960
Headache?

49:53.440 --> 49:56.200
I don't want to go and tell
the police about me car.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.079
OK.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.400
Is that OK?

50:09.400 --> 50:10.600
Why?

50:13.280 --> 50:14.720
Why don't you want to?

50:19.800 --> 50:21.280
Because...

50:22.520 --> 50:24.320
...I've done things.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.040
What things?

50:28.520 --> 50:30.199
Things.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.600
What things?

50:33.760 --> 50:35.440
I think you'll be cross.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.840
No, don't turn the light on.
Do you mind?

50:46.520 --> 50:48.720
What is it you've done, love?

50:51.040 --> 50:53.999
You know you can tell me anything.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.480
I've always said that. Haven't I?

50:58.040 --> 51:01.160
If you tell me the truth,
I won't be cross. About anything.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.519
Yeah.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.280
Well, then...

51:10.200 --> 51:12.240
I...

51:14.920 --> 51:16.240
Have you hurt someone?

51:17.480 --> 51:19.119
Yeah.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.639
With your car?

51:21.640 --> 51:22.960
No.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.520
Is it...?

51:30.400 --> 51:32.559
Is it to do with those women?

51:32.560 --> 51:34.239
Why you saying that?

51:34.240 --> 51:36.879
- Is it?
- Why you saying that?!

51:36.880 --> 51:38.639
Because...

51:38.640 --> 51:40.399
- I wondered.
- Had you? When?

51:40.400 --> 51:41.919
A while back.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.360
Why didn't you tell me?

51:50.720 --> 51:52.679
If it was...

51:52.680 --> 51:54.240
would you tell the police?

51:55.240 --> 51:57.160
Well, would you want me to?

51:58.320 --> 51:59.720
No.

52:01.680 --> 52:04.079
I just...
I don't know what I'd do

52:04.080 --> 52:06.519
if they came looking for me.

52:06.520 --> 52:09.039
The thing is,
they've got my DNA now,

52:09.040 --> 52:10.919
cos of that fight the other day.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.239
And I'd not get far if I set off.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.760
Why?!

52:17.480 --> 52:19.240
Why did you?

52:29.200 --> 52:31.919
Why, though?

52:31.920 --> 52:33.520
I don't know.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.680
We've had a funny life,
haven't we, lad?

53:04.960 --> 53:06.400
What you thinking?

53:09.880 --> 53:11.480
I don't know.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.560
I'm wondering
if there's a way forward.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.880
If we could get rid of the car.

53:21.120 --> 53:24.200
But then, there's 1,001
other things to think about.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.800
Are you sure it was you?

53:37.920 --> 53:39.720
Did someone tell you to do it?

53:40.800 --> 53:42.319
No.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.360
Voices?

53:45.240 --> 53:46.759
No.

53:46.760 --> 53:49.839
Sometimes people hear voices
telling 'em to do stuff.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.200
No.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.680
OK.

54:10.240 --> 54:13.040
You'll visit me, won't you,
in prison?

54:14.440 --> 54:16.520
I don't think you'd like prison.

54:18.880 --> 54:22.520
No, but if you can't think of
anything, then it's what'll happen.

54:52.400 --> 54:53.959
How's Neil?

54:53.960 --> 54:55.479
He's gone to work.

54:55.480 --> 54:58.880
- Oh, good.
- Half six this morning.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.359
That's good.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.679
Hey, have you run that theory
past Clare, Mum?

55:04.680 --> 55:06.599
- What theory?
- Which?

55:06.600 --> 55:08.399
That woman on your phone.

55:08.400 --> 55:11.279
Oh, yeah! You know a couple of
weeks ago,

55:11.280 --> 55:14.159
that new Miss Wealand, Whelan -
whatever her name is.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.639
Asking Ryan questions
about his dad.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.239
Yeah.

55:18.240 --> 55:21.719
Daniel reckons it's always
when he comes home from school

55:21.720 --> 55:24.119
that he starts asking
questions about him.

55:24.120 --> 55:27.239
- Is it?
- Yeah.
- Have you met her?

55:27.240 --> 55:28.840
Yeah, I told you I had.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.040
Where's your glasses?

55:36.440 --> 55:37.680
Isn't that a lad?

55:38.720 --> 55:41.280
No, it's a woman.
The man in the shop said.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.879
What you thinking?

55:50.880 --> 55:52.160
I'm thinking...

55:53.160 --> 55:54.560
What?

55:57.160 --> 55:58.720
It's her.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.160
This is nice.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.999
I've got a plan.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.879
Have you?

56:31.880 --> 56:35.559
You've always wanted to go
to America, haven't you?

56:35.560 --> 56:37.439
How we going to afford that?

56:37.440 --> 56:40.519
I've got some money put by.
Quite a bit.

56:40.520 --> 56:41.799
How much?

56:41.800 --> 56:43.759
Couple of thousand.

56:43.760 --> 56:45.599
We've got our passports.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.439
We'll call a taxi.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.359
Get on a train to Manchester.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.159
Then we'll get on an aeroplane.

56:51.160 --> 56:55.159
And they might catch up with us
eventually - I think they very
probably would -

56:55.160 --> 56:58.159
but at least you'll have done
something.

56:58.160 --> 57:01.759
At least we'd have seen something
of the world, had an adventure,
wouldn't we?

57:01.760 --> 57:03.319
Las Vegas?

57:03.320 --> 57:05.279
Is that what you'd like?

57:05.280 --> 57:09.000
Nevada. The desert.
Duke and Gonzo, we could hire a car.

57:13.640 --> 57:14.840
OK.

57:20.120 --> 57:21.760
Seriously?

57:31.760 --> 57:33.840
What else would you like to do?

57:34.880 --> 57:36.679
To see?

57:36.680 --> 57:39.279
- Florida.
- Yeah.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.600
- California.
- San Francisco.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.439
Who'll feed the sheep?

57:45.440 --> 57:46.960
I'll ask me sister.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.880
We could cycle across
the Golden Gate Bridge.

57:52.880 --> 57:55.159
You can hire bicycles.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.319
I saw it on a travel programme.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.279
Will she do that?

57:59.280 --> 58:02.119
Yeah. I'll pay her.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.199
Then you can get the ferry back.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.039
Go past Alcatraz.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.719
Won't go there, though.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.199
Can we go to Disneyland?

58:09.200 --> 58:11.240
Course we can, love.

58:12.305 --> 58:18.426
