Hi, boss.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.755
Driver sustained
heavy lacerations

00:59.842 --> 01:01.191
and head trauma,
but believe it or not

01:01.278 --> 01:02.453
they're saying he'll live.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.976
Lucky.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.154
Victim's Sharon Warwick, 23.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.286
She went off of a balcony,
room 914.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.375
'Rigsby's up there right now
with the forensics team.'

01:11.462 --> 01:13.508
Now off the bruise on the cheek
and the ripped vest

01:13.595 --> 01:15.379
'we're thinking it's murder.'

01:15.466 --> 01:16.772
Catering staff?

01:16.859 --> 01:17.860
Actually, she was
a cast member.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.470
Show's called, Torch.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.690
It's a story about
intersecting lives and loves

01:21.777 --> 01:23.735
in a New York night club
in the 1950s.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.998
The event tonight
was a fund-raiser for the show.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.914
Multiple witnesses say
the time of death is 8:01 p.m.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.307
right when the performance
was set to begin.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.222
Well, what was she doing
up there?

01:32.309 --> 01:34.659
We don't know yet. She was ID'd
by Warren Dodge, the producer.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.096
He's in there
with the director.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.488
Alright.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.969
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:41.666 --> 01:43.103
[Warren]
'Poor Sharon.'

01:43.190 --> 01:46.193
'Tragedy. Absolute tragedy.'

01:46.280 --> 01:48.108
But you know what?
We're gonna regroup

01:48.195 --> 01:49.413
and we'll move forward
from this, Bran.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.285
'Better and stronger.
You'll see.'

01:51.372 --> 01:52.460
Warren, our star
is in a cab blotto

01:52.547 --> 01:53.983
our second lead is dead.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.637
How do you propose
we do better and stronger?

01:55.724 --> 01:56.812
- Bran, listen--
- Uh, Mr. Dodge?

01:56.899 --> 01:58.161
- Yes?
- I'm Agent Lisbon.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.858
I need to ask you
some questions.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.686
Of course. Of course.
Can you give me just one minute?

02:01.773 --> 02:04.646
Bran, we are going
to get Torch to Broadway.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.343
We are, alright?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.692
I'll take care
of the investors.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.477
Hanover is solid,
that's 50% of our money.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.827
It's only the other investors we
have to worry about, alright?

02:11.914 --> 02:13.350
Your job is to keep calm

02:13.437 --> 02:14.351
and reassure
the cast and crew, alright?

02:14.438 --> 02:15.874
- Mr. Dodge.
- Yes?

02:15.961 --> 02:17.833
- And you are?
- Bran McTavish, the director.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.270
Did either of you actually
see Sharon Warwick fall?

02:20.357 --> 02:21.663
I was inside.
The show was starting.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.273
And I arrived
right after it happened.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.579
Do you have any idea

02:24.666 --> 02:26.363
what she was doing
up in room 914?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.496
Well, we were using that area as
a dressing room for this event.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.367
She was supposed to be
down in the ballroom.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.586
She was third cue.

02:31.673 --> 02:32.891
- Third cue?
- Yeah.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.197
We had, uh, actors
scattered about

02:34.284 --> 02:36.112
dressed as hotel guests,
workers, caterers.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.853
It was Bran's idea
to start the show.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.463
Yeah, a guest breaks out
into song

02:39.550 --> 02:40.769
then the bellboy,
then the waitress.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.379
That was Sharon.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.685
She was supposed to be
in the ballroom.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.121
You've both
been really helpful.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.123
If you wouldn't mind
going up to the room

02:47.210 --> 02:48.516
while we start
the investigation

02:48.603 --> 02:50.648
- I'd be grateful.
- Anything we can do.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.131
[instrumental music]

02:57.438 --> 02:58.569
[phone ringing]

03:00.005 --> 03:01.093
[Patrick]
'Hey, Lisbon.'

03:01.181 --> 03:02.573
'Where the hell are you?'

03:02.660 --> 03:04.532
'Don't tell me
you're at the hospital.'

03:04.619 --> 03:06.142
I'm not at the hospital.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.448
'We caught a case.'

03:07.535 --> 03:08.666
'You're needed
at the crime scene.'

03:08.753 --> 03:09.972
I'll be there soon.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.061
You're at the hospital,
aren't you?

03:12.148 --> 03:13.802
You told me to tell you
I'm not at the hospital.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.586
What do you want?
Make up your mind.

03:15.673 --> 03:16.935
Get out of there.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.850
IfJason Lennon wakes up

03:18.937 --> 03:20.374
and ifhe talks

03:20.461 --> 03:22.463
'and ifhe knows
Red John's identity'

03:22.550 --> 03:24.247
'Agent Kirkland
and homeland security'

03:24.334 --> 03:26.249
'are perfectly capable
of handling it.'

03:26.336 --> 03:28.382
I disagree.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.905
You're playing with fire.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.950
There are worse things
to play with.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.561
Oh, gotta go.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.694
Uh, Agent Kirkland.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.130
How did you get in?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.089
This wing
is closed to visitors.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.352
My Aunt Daphne's
in room 10.

03:42.439 --> 03:45.790
Kidney failure.
Poor dear. Drinks like a fish.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.227
You must be broken up about it.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
Look at you. You're a mess.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.145
We both know why you're here.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.801
Although I find your need to
talk to Lennon now interesting.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.804
You did stand by
while Lorelei Martins shot him.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.284
How's he doing?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.852
He'll live
to talk to us.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.115
And I'll let you know if he has
anything interesting to say.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.988
You're always good
to talk to you, Patrick.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.251
But I think
you should go now

04:11.338 --> 04:13.165
before we start
disturbing the patients.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.645
- Hmm.
- This way, sir.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.560
Yeah. I'm going.
That's my arm.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.345
You have two of your own.
Thank you.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.217
How didyou get in here?

04:21.304 --> 04:23.175
'Who let you in?'

04:23.263 --> 04:25.134
Well, if I told you that,
I wouldn't be able to get in

04:25.221 --> 04:27.267
when I come back,
would I?

04:30.618 --> 04:33.490
[theme music]

04:40.584 --> 04:42.673
[dramatic music]

04:42.760 --> 04:45.023
[Lisbon]
'Uh, did anybody have access
to the suite besides Sharon?'

04:45.110 --> 04:47.374
This served as a sort of
communal dressing area

04:47.461 --> 04:49.767
for this event,
so, everybody, really.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.944
The whole cast plus myself,
Dodge, and, uh, Sylvia.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.729
Hey, um, have you
spoken to Hanover?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.600
I wanna make sure he hears
about this from us first.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.298
Uh, Sylvia, you worry
about the other investors.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.690
Let me deal with
Hanover, alright?

04:59.777 --> 05:01.344
Um, this is Sylvia Clare,
our publicist.

05:01.431 --> 05:04.391
Sylvia, uh, Agent Lisbon
is with the CBI.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.696
Who's Hanover?

05:05.783 --> 05:07.785
Our patron.
Our main investor.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.310
Oh, Jane, there you are.
This is the--

05:10.397 --> 05:12.877
No need. I just caught up
in the elevator.

05:12.964 --> 05:17.142
Uh, Dodge, McTavish,
and Clare

05:17.229 --> 05:19.580
producer, director, publicist.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.713
Was Sharon having any trouble
with the, uh, cast or crew?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.324
No, no. Not at all.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.413
We're a very happy family
here at Torch.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.937
Yes, of course. That's exactly
what a good publicist

05:29.024 --> 05:31.809
should say, isn't it?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.986
Uh, where were you when
the victim fell, Ms. Clare?

05:35.073 --> 05:36.684
Oh, I was in the ballroom.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.512
Mr. Dodge, uh,
why would you wanna

05:38.599 --> 05:40.383
cast Sharon Warwick
as the second lead?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.994
According to this, she doesn't
have much theater experience.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.996
Her paragraph's very short.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.695
Well, uh, Sharon came
out here from New York

05:47.782 --> 05:50.262
and she just knocked
Bran out with her audition.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.090
And, uh,
I trust his judgment.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.005
She's a natural dancer,
big voice

05:54.092 --> 05:55.572
quick learner,
and she was hungry.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.834
- Hmm.
- That's all you need.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.358
Well, what was
in it for her?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.751
I mean, it's a revival
in the sticks.

06:00.838 --> 06:04.407
She was already a well-known
singer in New York.

06:04.494 --> 06:07.279
She wanted to be a part
of something special.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.369
Exactly. I mean, we're starting
out here in Sacramento

06:09.456 --> 06:11.458
but Torch will be
on Broadway in six months.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.111
And a Tony contender in nine.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.159
Did the cast have
much contact with the locals?

06:17.246 --> 06:19.466
Uh, I don't know. I don't..
I don't think so.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.206
Oh, I wouldn't think
they'd have the time.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.383
They would have been right
into rehearsals straightaway.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.254
- Yeah. That's right.
- So, yeah.

06:25.341 --> 06:26.690
So you think like me.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.171
The killer is connected
to your musical.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.738
Any guesses?

06:32.653 --> 06:34.394
No? Okay. Thanks.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.833
[Dodge]
I'm sorry. Who is that?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.400
He's a consultant.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.272
Thank you for your time.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.147
The suspect pool is huge.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.758
It's gonna be a nightmare.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.499
Why start on such
a pessimistic foot?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.152
Why are you so glum?

06:54.239 --> 06:55.850
I call you up, and you're
creeping around Lennon

06:55.937 --> 06:57.417
getting into
Kirkland's business.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.635
Of course I'm glum.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.898
- Oh, that.
- Yeah. That.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.727
We look bad enough after
the whole Lorelei Martins mess.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.555
Lennon is a direct link
to Red John.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.209
I need to talk to him.

07:07.296 --> 07:11.213
You need to try and start
following the rules for a while.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.693
And if you must
break the rules

07:12.780 --> 07:14.085
break them on your own time.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.697
When am I not
on my own time?

07:33.322 --> 07:34.454
It's so good to see you.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.064
- Hi.
- How was LA?

07:36.151 --> 07:37.892
I learned a lot
of really great stuff

07:37.979 --> 07:39.633
but I don't know
how anybody lives there.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.112
I'm really happy
to be home.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.331
Well, welcome back
to the grindstone.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.593
Yeah. What's with
the music?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.290
Our victim's a singer.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.727
She was pushed
out of a window.

07:46.814 --> 07:47.771
It's kind of catchy, huh?

07:47.858 --> 07:49.381
It was an internet hit.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.209
She comes out here to star
in a musical and gets killed.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.994
Van Pelt! Welcome back.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.909
Thanks, boss.
It's good to be back.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.171
It's good to see you.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.694
How we doing so far?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.740
Good. Found out that Warwick
was actually a local.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.655
Really? The people
from the theater company

08:01.742 --> 08:02.960
seemed to think
she was from New York.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.962
No, I spoke to
a Polly Datch.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.486
Said she was Warwick's foster
mother here in Sacramento.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.400
She's on her way to CBI.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.054
What about Warwick's timeline
the night of the murder?

08:10.141 --> 08:12.230
I've spoken to about
half the cast so far.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.710
Bad news is they
were leaving the door

08:13.797 --> 08:15.320
to that room unlocked
for ease of access.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.931
So anyone could have been
in there when she died?

08:17.018 --> 08:19.194
Yeah. The good news is we got
a whole lot of video

08:19.281 --> 08:20.935
and photos to work off.

08:21.022 --> 08:23.328
So the cast left the room
at around a quarter of 8:00

08:23.415 --> 08:26.114
'to get into position.
Warwick was with them.'

08:26.201 --> 08:28.812
'She leaves the ballroom
at 7:52.'

08:28.899 --> 08:31.598
At 8:01, she hits the limo.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.730
Was anyone else from production
missing during that period?

08:33.817 --> 08:35.515
I can't tell just yet.
I'll keep digging.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.168
Did anybody leave
in a hurry after she fell?

08:37.255 --> 08:39.649
Yeah, one.
Deandra Sunderland, the star.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.042
Now the rumor among the cast

08:41.129 --> 08:42.609
'is that she's got
a drinking problem'

08:42.696 --> 08:43.827
'so they think she's probably
getting sauced'

08:43.914 --> 08:45.873
'in one of the, uh,
hotel bars.'

08:45.960 --> 08:48.092
A fading diva with a drinking
problem? That's unusual.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.312
Yeah. Check this out, this is
her leaving out the back door.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.141
[Teresa]
'Well, when was that?'

08:53.228 --> 08:54.751
About a half-hour
after the murder.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.753
Uh, what about the surveillance
footage from the hotel?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.625
Cameras in the lobby
and all the elevators.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.800
It's being sent over.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.975
What about the investor Hanover?

09:01.062 --> 09:02.367
Do you have
anything on him?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.065
Yeah, the cast had a lot
to say about him, too.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.241
Apparently he can buy Delaware.
We also found his arrival

09:06.328 --> 09:09.287
in the party footage
the publicist sent over.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.724
'I looked him up
on the internet.'

09:10.811 --> 09:13.509
He's a currency trader,
and he likes the arts.

09:13.596 --> 09:16.077
Hey, boss, Polly Datch,
victim's foster mom.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.122
- Wants to talk to you.
- Alright.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.866
[dramatic music]

09:30.526 --> 09:33.703
Uh, Mrs. Datch?
I'm Agent Lisbon.

09:33.790 --> 09:37.577
Uh, you were Sharon Warwick's
foster parent?

09:37.664 --> 09:40.754
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh, for how long?

09:40.841 --> 09:43.365
Sharon came to live with me
when she was 12.

09:43.452 --> 09:46.150
Never knew
her biological parents.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.804
I stay close
with most of my kids

09:47.891 --> 09:49.806
but Sharon was special.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.158
That's the man
you need to find

09:54.245 --> 09:55.899
'Billy Racine.'

09:55.986 --> 09:57.422
[Teresa]
'Who is he?'

09:57.509 --> 09:59.555
No-good thug, that's who.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.730
Is he an ex-boyfriend?

10:00.817 --> 10:02.471
He was her one bad choice.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.343
Had she been
in contact with Racine

10:05.430 --> 10:07.128
since you came back to town?

10:07.215 --> 10:08.695
I'm sure of it.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.349
And I think he assaulted
her a week ago.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.177
You think?

10:13.264 --> 10:16.093
I don't really know because
she wouldn't talk about it.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.792
She brushed it off,
called it a botched mugging.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.054
But I'm certain it was him.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.404
Why else wouldn't she
report it?

10:22.491 --> 10:24.449
Had he been violent
with her in the past?

10:24.536 --> 10:27.104
Sharon said no, but..

10:27.191 --> 10:29.629
I know Billy Racine
is a violent man.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.418
Uh-huh.

10:36.505 --> 10:37.898
Sure.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.465
Of course, Mr. Hanover.
Thank you for your time.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.989
Finally found Hanover?

10:42.076 --> 10:43.425
Yeah. He didn't see
the crash either

10:43.512 --> 10:44.905
but he said he'd be
happy to talk to us

10:44.992 --> 10:46.080
when he gets back in town.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.342
Backin town?

10:47.429 --> 10:48.648
He had to fly
to an art opening.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.910
A piece
he just had to have.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.999
- Rich people.
- What'd you get?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.740
Lisbon got this
from the foster mom.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.872
Name's Billy Racine.
Ex-boyfriend.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.919
Foster mother thinks
he could have done it.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.007
Guy's had a life.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.704
Multiple assaults, extortion.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.011
Hmm. That name
sounds familiar.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.711
'"Racine William."'

11:08.798 --> 11:10.495
He's on the list of people
who purchased tickets

11:10.582 --> 11:12.106
to the show's fund-raiser.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.891
What was he doing there?

11:14.978 --> 11:16.893
I'll see if I can
track him down.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.076
Thanks.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.861
What were you doing
at the fund-raiser for Torch

11:27.948 --> 11:29.950
two nights ago?

11:30.037 --> 11:32.387
Supporting the arts.

11:32.474 --> 11:35.695
Did you have any contact with
Sharon Warwick that evening?

11:35.782 --> 11:37.087
If I did,
what's it matter?

11:37.174 --> 11:38.872
You two had quite
the tempestuous relationship

11:38.959 --> 11:40.917
before she moved to New York.

11:41.004 --> 11:44.268
Shouting matches. You even
put your fist through a wall.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.487
Did you pick up
where you left off

11:45.574 --> 11:46.749
when she came back
a month ago?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.969
Don't even try
to pin this on me.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.579
I know what's happened,
and I didn't kill her.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.015
Why should I believe you?

11:52.102 --> 11:54.409
Because I would never
put my hands on that girl.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.845
I loved her.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.064
I think you loved her
maybe too much.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.589
She rejected you, you didn't
take no for an answer

12:00.676 --> 12:02.634
you stalked her
to the fund-raiser.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.071
And when she
rejected you again

12:04.158 --> 12:05.681
your hands
got the better of you.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.772
I went there
to protect her.

12:09.859 --> 12:10.991
Protect her from what?

12:11.078 --> 12:12.514
She got mugged last week.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.863
Said she fought 'em off

12:13.950 --> 12:15.082
and scratched one of them up
pretty good

12:15.169 --> 12:16.692
but I could see
she was shook.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.825
What does that have to do
with the fund-raiser?

12:18.912 --> 12:22.089
Sharon thought someone
from the show set it up.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.874
So when I heard they
were doing that party..

12:24.961 --> 12:27.268
You went to find
her attackers?

12:27.355 --> 12:30.097
I was gonna tune
some people up.

12:30.184 --> 12:33.840
But Sharon said, be easy.
Said she'd handle it.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.319
Did she say
who she suspected?

12:35.406 --> 12:37.495
She wouldn't say.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.149
She was scared I was gonna do
something bad to 'em.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.977
And she was right.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.066
So you're telling me everything
was good between you two?

12:43.153 --> 12:44.981
[scoffs]

12:45.068 --> 12:47.810
You've been talking to
that old foster lady, huh?

12:47.897 --> 12:49.856
She never liked me.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.596
You can't believe
what she says.

you audition replacements?

Uh, well, because our investor
performance was rescheduled

13:23.803 --> 13:25.543
and, uh,
we have to be ready.

a murder.

Well, you won't
find any clues here.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.417
Actually, we could learn a lot
from watching a rehearsal.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.289
Oh, really?

14:15.376 --> 14:18.814
Yes. The way a person sings
says a great deal about them.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.556
For instance, Bridget, you have
a very sweet tone.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.210
Thank you.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.648
Yes, with nice shades
of pent-up anger and envy.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.043
yet you may come
to replace her.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.960
So obviously, you had very good
motive to want to kill her.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.876
But I don't think you have
the stomach or the strength

14:36.963 --> 14:38.790
to push someone off a balcony.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.402
You, Mandy,

of murder.

a very strong instrument.'

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754

enough to kill?

that kind of passion?'

14:50.672 --> 14:53.196

their performances off.

isn't good for morale.

to be handling it okay.

Uh, I was wondering if you knew
what jazz hands were?

16:58.234 --> 17:01.542
Sure. It's the use of big
hand movements in choreography.

17:01.629 --> 17:02.804
Why do you ask?

17:02.891 --> 17:04.023
Oh, I just overheard
the director

17:04.110 --> 17:05.676
ranting about jazz hands

17:05.763 --> 17:08.462
so I was curious to know
what got him so worked up.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.377
Ranting how?

17:10.464 --> 17:12.770
Well apparently, he hate,
hate, hates jazz hands.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.511
And if he sees one
jazzy little hand

17:14.598 --> 17:16.948
that dancer
is out of the show.

Oh. Good to know.
Thanks.

No worries. Uh, you might
wanna pass that on

comes up after you.

herself very shortly.

What are you doing, Bridget?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.184
Suddenly we were in
a cabaret bar in Idaho.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.099
I thought you wanted
bigger hand movement.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.883
What gave you that idea?

19:05.970 --> 19:09.278
I'm sorry, but this, uh,
might indirectly be my doing.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.150
[sighs]

19:11.237 --> 19:12.803
I told the first dancer
that the director

19:12.890 --> 19:17.895
would fire anyone
that added big hand movements.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.375
What?

19:19.462 --> 19:21.377
And she, along with everyone
else who auditioned

19:21.464 --> 19:24.119
'made sure that the dancer
that came after them'

19:24.206 --> 19:25.990
didn't use the jazz hands

lose their job

You can't be serious.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.697
Only a scheming
and conniving person

19:36.784 --> 19:40.309
'would so callously try to get
a fellow cast mate fired.'

19:40.396 --> 19:44.139
There's no telling how far
someone like you will go.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.923
Is he telling
the truth, Mandy?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.447
What does it matter?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.057
At least the hands
distract away

19:49.144 --> 19:51.929
from the dreadful
syncopation problem you have.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.148
You wanted me to fail?

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
- That's not hard.
- You bitch.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.499
Oh!

19:56.586 --> 19:58.022
- Uh, Rigsby?
- Okay.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.763
I'm sorry. What did you
just call me?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.461
- Oh, I'm sorry--
- Get your hands off me!

20:01.548 --> 20:03.463
You mind stepping in
and handling this?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.943
[both screaming]

20:06.030 --> 20:07.162
Ladies, ladies, ladies

20:07.249 --> 20:08.946
I have an errand to run.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.949
[screaming]

20:13.342 --> 20:14.996
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Okay, let's..

20:15.083 --> 20:16.432
[both screaming]

20:17.825 --> 20:19.130
[Wayne]
'Help!'

20:19.218 --> 20:20.697
- Aah!
- Okay.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.919
I know you're only talking to me
to get information out of me

20:25.006 --> 20:27.791
but it's been nice.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.793
You make me smile.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.927
Well, what's worth
more than a smile?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.755
True enough.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.935
Mr. Lennon
is pretty much stable.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.545
His blood volume is up

20:42.632 --> 20:43.981
and the doctors could
bring him out of the coma

20:44.068 --> 20:45.374
as early as tomorrow.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.116
Thank you.
That's very good to know.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.858
What is all this about?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.643
And why are the federal guys
so weird and creepy?

20:53.730 --> 20:56.342
They are? How are they
weird and creepy?

20:56.429 --> 20:58.866
Like they're not
what they seem.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.477
Like one day they might
pull their faces off

21:01.564 --> 21:03.610
and there'd be alien lizards
underneath, you know?

21:03.697 --> 21:06.439
I know. Not impossible,
but very unlikely.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.704
I know.
They just have that vibe.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.620
I understand.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.231
Will you call me when they bring
Mr. Lennon out of his coma?

21:16.318 --> 21:17.624
Sure.

21:17.711 --> 21:20.061
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.720
Interesting set
of scratch marks.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.113
What happened?

21:29.200 --> 21:31.333
Cat.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.117
Hm.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.032
Sharon Warwick fought back
against one of her attackers

21:35.119 --> 21:36.338
when she was mugged.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.122
Know anything about that?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.562
You know they found
DNA samples

21:42.649 --> 21:45.478
under Sharon's nails
after the murder?

21:45.565 --> 21:46.870
It's amazing
how a little DNA.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.785
Can tie two people
together.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.440
Okay. The mugging,
that was me.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.876
I just wanted
to scare her a little bit.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.269
I didn't kill her.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.966
Who was your accomplice?

21:57.272 --> 21:58.665
A guy named Joey.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.145
He's my partner
in salsa class.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.495
And why did you want
to scare her?

22:02.582 --> 22:03.670
Because she was just
some girl

22:03.757 --> 22:05.498
with an okay voice
and no resume

22:05.585 --> 22:07.500
and there she was
headlining with Deandra.

22:07.587 --> 22:08.979
And that made you mad?

22:09.066 --> 22:10.938
Second lead should have
been me, not Sharon.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.505
So when she showed up
for the fund-raiser

22:12.592 --> 22:14.463
ready to launch
a star-making turn

22:14.550 --> 22:16.291
you snapped and you
pushed her off that balcony.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.424
I told you
I didn't kill her.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.295
Well, you've already admitted
to organizing an assault.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.731
Why is it so crazy to think

22:21.818 --> 22:23.385
that you didn't decide
to finish the job?

22:23.472 --> 22:24.952
Because I didn't
want her dead.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.954
I just wanted her to leave.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.567
If you're looking
for suspects

22:31.654 --> 22:33.787
you might wanna check out
the star of the show.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.615
Deandra Sunderland?

22:35.702 --> 22:38.357
The queen of mean.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.142
What makes you think Sunderland
could have killed Warwick?

22:41.229 --> 22:44.972
Because the director wanted to
replace Deandra with Sharon.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.713
Everybody knew it.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.107
I mean she's too old to be
playing the ingenue, right?

22:50.194 --> 22:51.587
Did you see Sunderland
the night of the murder?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.895
No.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.419
She was nowhere to be found
when the overture began.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.812
What about
after the accident?

22:58.899 --> 23:00.248
Uh-uh.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.685
Not until rehearsal
the next morning.

23:55.999 --> 23:59.612
Uh, okay.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.092

24:02.179 --> 24:04.268
Sorry. Um, how long
you gonna keep Mandy?

24:04.355 --> 24:07.620
A while. That's what we do
when people break the law.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.143
Okay, look, agent,
I'm a pro.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.405
I can spin this tragedy.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.928
It can even add
an air of fascination

24:12.015 --> 24:13.147
to the production.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.714
But if you arrest the cast

24:14.801 --> 24:17.020
right before a performance
for the investors

24:17.107 --> 24:18.718
that makes my job
rather difficult.

24:18.805 --> 24:22.765
You see, I need my investors
to stay invested.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.375
Well, brace yourself

24:24.463 --> 24:27.901
because now I need to talk

24:55.668 --> 24:57.757
My apologies
for interrupting.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.454
We need to talk.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.283
I'm rehearsing here.
I asked not to be disturbed.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.503
This is important.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.939
Where were you
when Sharon Warwick

25:06.026 --> 25:07.810
fell off the balcony?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.901
I was in the ballroom.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.948
All of our evidence
points to the contrary.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.384
Everybody involved
in the production

25:16.471 --> 25:19.213
seems to think
you were off drinking.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.041
I think you might have been
with Sharon.

25:22.869 --> 25:24.871
I think you found out that
McTavish was planning

25:24.958 --> 25:27.830
on replacing you with her,
and you got mad.

25:27.917 --> 25:31.617
He wanted Sharon
to replace me?

25:31.704 --> 25:34.010
She was studying film
of all of your performances

25:34.097 --> 25:35.534
and memorizing your lines.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.715
You don't understand.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.630
She would if you told her
the truth.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.333
You sing beautifully.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.293
How long have you been
out there?

25:56.380 --> 25:59.035
Long enough.

25:59.122 --> 26:02.473
You know, I kept wondering
what brought Sharon Warwick

26:02.561 --> 26:04.127
back to Sacramento.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.955
She left Sacramento
because she wanted something

26:06.042 --> 26:07.653
and now she's back.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.787
It's obviously connected
to Torch

26:11.874 --> 26:13.223
but it couldn't be acclaim
she was looking for

26:13.310 --> 26:16.009
'cause she got that
in New York City.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.708
And then I heard you sing,
and it came to me.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.846
What is it that every
foster child is looking for?

26:26.933 --> 26:30.110
Lisbon, I'd like you to meet
Sharon Warwick's mother.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.072
[crying]

26:45.778 --> 26:47.170
[sniffles]

26:48.345 --> 26:49.390
I was, uh..

26:49.477 --> 26:50.913
[sniffles]

26:51.000 --> 26:53.524
Very young when I had Sharon.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.659
Her father was my director.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.488
And he was married.

27:03.578 --> 27:08.104
The hardest thing I ever did
in my life was giving her away.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.063
When did she learn
she was your daughter?

27:11.412 --> 27:13.370
She came to my dressing room

27:13.457 --> 27:15.503
after the first day
of rehearsals.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.984
Must have been a shock.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.639
I felt so happy seeing
the person that she had become.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.294
So talented, so..

27:25.948 --> 27:28.255
...full of life.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.300
Why did you keep it
a secret?

27:33.826 --> 27:35.828
Guilt. Shame.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.874
Something else.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.964
You're hiding
something else.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.666
You're quite a clever policeman,
aren't you?

27:50.190 --> 27:51.757
I have multiple sclerosis.

27:54.107 --> 27:56.152
Diagnosed six months ago.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.502
Hmm. I'm sorry.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.812
Symptoms of the disease
is what made people think

28:03.899 --> 28:05.640
you were drinking.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.252
Well, I've been sober
for 14 years.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.167
'Haven't touched a drop.'

28:12.995 --> 28:15.824
I heard the whispers
behind my back.

28:17.521 --> 28:19.610
I thought it might
be better to quit.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.831
Sharon was so mad.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.356
Already protective
towards me.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.795
She told me to be strong.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.187
And you had an attack

28:31.274 --> 28:33.842
right before the first
performance, didn't you?

28:33.929 --> 28:36.410
You didn't have
your medication.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.064
Yes.

28:38.151 --> 28:41.632
Sharon said she'd go up
to the suite and get it for you.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.507
She was an
incredible young woman.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.729
That's why I can't quit
the show.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.383
'I have to go on with it.'

28:53.470 --> 28:54.950
To honor my child.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.697
- Morning.
- Morning.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.178
Morning. We've been through
all the photos, videos

29:05.265 --> 29:06.614
and security footage.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.485
Cross-indexed every guest,
hotel worker

29:08.572 --> 29:10.574
'attendee, and person
connected to the play.'

29:10.661 --> 29:12.881
All their movements are
accounted for, except for him.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.579
Berndt Hanover,
the investor?

29:15.666 --> 29:17.973
He, uh, here he is
before the murder

29:18.060 --> 29:20.019
getting into the elevator.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.064
'He goes to the floor
Sharon Warwick was killed on'

29:22.151 --> 29:25.024
'and gets off, and that's
the last time we see him.'

29:25.111 --> 29:26.939
[Teresa]
What do you mean?
How can that be?

29:27.026 --> 29:28.984
[Grace]
I don't know. He never gets
back on the elevator

29:29.071 --> 29:30.681
and he's never seen
leaving the building.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.814
Okay, but how? Why?

29:32.901 --> 29:35.948
How does he leave the building
without being seen?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.037
If he waited until
the hallway was empty

29:38.124 --> 29:40.474
he could've taken the stairs
down to the first floor.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.303
Yeah, but how does he avoid
being seen after that?

29:43.390 --> 29:46.175
It, it's not like he's a guy
who doesn't stand out.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.611
True.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.919
[sighs]

29:51.006 --> 29:52.616
This is the room
the murder took place.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.054
That's the balcony. Doorway
out here to the corridor.

29:55.141 --> 29:58.231
Past the stairs,
down to the elevators.

29:58.318 --> 30:03.584
This, if I recall, was a window
out to a fire escape.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.238
Could he have gone down
a fire escape?

30:05.325 --> 30:07.196
He's a big man.
I don't think he's that agile.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.458
Then what?

30:08.545 --> 30:11.113
Hmm. Yes, it's a puzzle.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.854
[chuckles]

30:12.941 --> 30:14.900
Why do you look so happy?

30:14.987 --> 30:17.685
'You have a way to solve
the puzzle?'

30:17.772 --> 30:19.382
Naturally.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.431
Meet me at the theater.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.482
[J.J.]
'This is good work.'

30:32.569 --> 30:34.833
Keep me informed
of your progress.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.966
[clears throat]

30:45.408 --> 30:48.063
Why are you lurking
out there, Mr. Jane?

30:52.981 --> 30:54.853
I need a favor.

30:54.940 --> 30:58.334
Is this the type
of favor where

30:58.421 --> 31:00.336
you would then owe me
a favor?

31:00.423 --> 31:02.556
Actually, you already
owe me a favor

31:02.643 --> 31:04.819
but I'll spot you another
if that pleases you.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.998
What do you need?

31:10.085 --> 31:12.392
I need you.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.655
Okay, 15 minutes to curtain,
people.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.483
Let's pick it up, pick it up.

31:19.268 --> 31:23.011
Um, hey, Deandra, uh,
don't forget to wait

31:23.098 --> 31:25.492
three bars
in the first intro, okay?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.189
Darling, I've been doing this
since before you learned

31:27.276 --> 31:29.278
to wipe your own nose.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.541
Worry about
your own business.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.502
Never direct.
Never direct.

31:37.765 --> 31:40.289
Ladies and gentlemen, if you
will kindly enter the theater

31:40.376 --> 31:42.552
and take your seats, please.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.684
[indistinct chattering]

31:43.771 --> 31:45.033
[Teresa sighs]

31:49.081 --> 31:51.474
Hey, Lisbon,
you at the theater yet?

31:51.561 --> 31:53.085
Jane, where are you?

31:53.172 --> 31:55.391
Uh, on my way.
Almost there.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.828
You head backstage.
We'll see you in a minute.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.395
We? Who's we?

31:59.482 --> 32:02.485
I'll see you very soon,
Lisbon, bye.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.966
I don't know about this.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.837
Oh, trust me.
You'll have fun.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.015
"Trust me.
You'll have fun."

32:10.102 --> 32:13.061
Was there ever
a more suspicious phase?

32:13.148 --> 32:15.890
J.J., you have to live
a little.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.762
You spend your days
chasing paper clip thieves.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.896
When do you ever get the chance
to nail a killer?

32:21.983 --> 32:23.202
No, it's true.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.987
I'm happy to help.

32:26.074 --> 32:29.512
[clears throat]
It's the performance aspect

32:29.599 --> 32:31.297
that concerns me.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.214
What performance aspect?

32:35.301 --> 32:36.737
You go into a room.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.521
If someone says anything
to you

32:38.608 --> 32:41.568
you say, ha ha ha,
or perhaps..

32:43.439 --> 32:45.920
Ha ha ha.

32:46.007 --> 32:49.228
Perhaps.

32:49.315 --> 32:50.925
Good enough.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.017
Would an accent help?

32:56.104 --> 32:58.237
Eh..

32:58.324 --> 33:00.848
Keep it simple.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.719
As you know,
this, uh, show

33:02.806 --> 33:05.940
has faced a great deal
of hardship and tragedy

33:06.027 --> 33:07.637
'the past few days.'

33:07.724 --> 33:11.206
'But I can tell you that it has
only made us stronger.'

33:15.602 --> 33:17.299
Evening, Lisbon,
you having fun yet?

33:17.386 --> 33:19.040
There you are. Where have
you been and what's your plan?

33:19.127 --> 33:21.042
I will tell you
in one minute.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.479
Oh, good evening,
and what an evening it is.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.003
Lisbon, you remember
Mr. Dodge?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.395
Of course.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.658
Agents, what are you doing here?

33:28.745 --> 33:30.008
Ah, I've gotta tell you,
Mr. Dodge

33:30.095 --> 33:31.487
after watching
all those rehearsals

33:31.574 --> 33:33.707
We couldn't just stay away,
could we?

33:33.794 --> 33:35.013
Okay, uh, Warren, you're
supposed to go say something.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.927
Yes, I know. I'm ready.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.279
[Bran]
'Finally, let me introduce
our esteemed producer'

33:40.366 --> 33:41.628
Warren Dodge, to tell you..

33:41.715 --> 33:43.543
[clears throat]
Who is that?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.371
Hmm?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.895
Oh, my goodness.
It's Berndt Hanover.

33:47.982 --> 33:51.377
Mr. Hanover. Hi.
What a wonderful surprise.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.255
[Sylvia]
'Mr. Hanover, such an honor.'

34:00.342 --> 34:02.040
I'm, I'm Sylvia Clare.
We spoke on the phone.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
Your trip was a good one,
I hope?

34:03.780 --> 34:06.087
Yes, it was very good.
Thank you, Ms. Clare.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.436
- Sure.
- 'Excuse me.'

34:07.523 --> 34:10.004
What's going on?

34:10.091 --> 34:13.268
Warren? Why don't you come out
and talk to the lovely people?

34:13.355 --> 34:16.010
Ms. Clare, I have come
to address

34:16.097 --> 34:17.490
my fellow investors.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.970
Why don't I go and speak
to them now?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.798
- What?
- Oh, terrific.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.278
That is a great idea.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.063
- Isn't it, Warren?
- Who are you, huh?

34:25.150 --> 34:26.281
W-w-whoa. Wait.
What are you doing?

34:26.368 --> 34:28.327
He's not Berndt Hanover.
He's a fraud!

34:28.414 --> 34:30.546
Warren! What is going on?

34:30.633 --> 34:31.591
I don't know what game
he's playing

34:31.678 --> 34:33.071
but he's not Hanover.

34:33.158 --> 34:34.420
Well, what are you saying?
Then who is he?

34:34.507 --> 34:36.639
His name is J.J. Laroche.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.686
Mr. Dodge is correct.
It isn't Berndt Hanover.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.688
Okay, I'm totally confused.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.472
Ah, we faked it.
The hat, the glasses

34:43.559 --> 34:44.821
'The cane, the coat.'

34:44.908 --> 34:47.433
Et voila.Berndt Hanover.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.738
But why?

34:48.825 --> 34:51.045
A test. You all believed
it was him

34:51.132 --> 34:53.656
and it was easy to make you
believe it.

34:53.743 --> 34:57.051
For about ten seconds,
until he said that I wasn't.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.749
'And then nobody believed
it anymore'

34:59.836 --> 35:01.621
just like I don't believe
anymore

35:01.708 --> 35:04.014
that Berndt Hanover exists.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.321
- What? Well, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?

35:06.408 --> 35:08.018
Of course Berndt Hanover exists.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.673
Then produce him.
You're a producer. Where is he?

35:10.760 --> 35:13.981
Well.. I just can't magically
make him appear.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.070
Call him.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.159
Mr. Jane, I don't have
his phone number on me.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.856
Hard to believe.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.336
You know, uh,
it's at my office

35:21.423 --> 35:22.816
and I will call him there,
uh, when I'm--

35:22.903 --> 35:25.384
- I have it. I'll call him.
- That's lucky.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.735
- I'm calling him.
- Good idea.

35:28.822 --> 35:31.259
- It's ringing.
- Excellent.

35:31.346 --> 35:34.001
He might not answer.
He's a.. He's a very busy man.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.003
Of course.

35:36.090 --> 35:40.094
[Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony"
ringtone playing]

35:40.181 --> 35:42.662
Excuse me.

35:42.749 --> 35:45.012
Your coat is playing
the Fifth Symphony.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.930
Gonna answer that,
Mr. Dodge?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.847
Or should we call you
mister..

35:53.934 --> 35:55.240
...Hanover?

35:57.938 --> 36:00.027
Hello? Sorry. Mr. Dodge

36:00.114 --> 36:01.768
can't come to the phone
right now, Sylvia.

36:01.855 --> 36:03.944
He's a little busy
getting arrested.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.600
Hanover didn't come down
in the elevator

36:07.687 --> 36:10.690
because Hanover
never even existed.

36:10.777 --> 36:14.041
'Dodge was playing the part
from the beginning.'

36:14.128 --> 36:16.609
He took off his disguise,
eluded the cameras

36:16.696 --> 36:18.088
by coming down a fire escape.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.308
Lisbon, he's all yours.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.833
You're under arrest.

36:26.575 --> 36:29.491
Tell me that wasn't fun.

36:29.578 --> 36:33.582
I cannot tell you that,
but we are even, yes?

36:33.669 --> 36:35.149
Yes.

36:38.805 --> 36:42.635
I wanted the show to work.
I was willing to do anything.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.289
Even kill?

36:44.376 --> 36:45.855
W..

36:45.942 --> 36:47.379
She surprised me.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.426
[Warren]
When I was changing
out of the Hanover costume

36:51.513 --> 36:53.298
nobody was supposed to be
in the room at that time.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.213
Nobody.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.606
I told her that I put every
penny I had into the show

36:57.693 --> 37:00.740
and that Hanover was necessary to give our investors

37:00.827 --> 37:02.872
a confidence
and peace of mind

37:02.959 --> 37:05.179
and that once I had
the money I needed

37:05.266 --> 37:07.355
I would make
Hanover disappear..

37:07.442 --> 37:10.358
And that everything
would work out in the end.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.186
But she said no.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.365
She wouldn't be
any part of it--

37:17.452 --> 37:20.934
That she was going to
tell Sunderland

37:21.021 --> 37:25.112
which of course meant that
everyone would find out and..

37:25.199 --> 37:27.245
That would ruined everything.

37:34.556 --> 37:37.211
Yeah. I didn't mean
for this to happen.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.432
So what happened next?

37:40.519 --> 37:44.131
Uh, I left by the fire escape.
No one saw me.

37:44.218 --> 37:47.090
And then I went and got
in my car around the corner

37:47.177 --> 37:50.050
and I drove up and introduced
myself to the police.

37:54.968 --> 37:58.319
This was gonna be the hit show
that put me back on top.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.540
Everyone would have benefited.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.717
If only she hadn't
walked through that door.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.423
[crying]

38:20.428 --> 38:23.866
I, um, I didn't have
nearly enough time with her.

38:25.825 --> 38:29.394
But I so loved the person
that she was and respected her.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.137
Thank you for
giving her justice.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.791
It means a lot.

38:35.878 --> 38:36.879
[phone ringing]

38:36.966 --> 38:38.707
I'm sorry.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.753
Embarrassing.
Uh, I have to take this.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.232
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.712
Hello?

38:43.799 --> 38:45.279
'Patrick, it's Sheila
from the hospital.'

38:45.366 --> 38:47.325
They're bringing him
out of the coma.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.501
When?

38:49.588 --> 38:51.198
You need to get over here.

38:51.285 --> 38:54.723
Okay. Um.. S.. I..

38:54.810 --> 38:57.073
He's conscious,
but keep an eye on him.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.684
Hit that button,
and we'll be right in.

38:58.771 --> 39:02.557
- Okay, thank you, nurse.
- Mm-hmm.

39:02.644 --> 39:03.776
[door closes]

39:06.909 --> 39:08.084
[sighs]

39:09.738 --> 39:12.437
You are one tough SOB,
Jason Lennon.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.875
You really are.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.616
Where am I?

39:19.574 --> 39:21.707
What happened?

39:21.794 --> 39:25.014
You're in Sacramento.
You got shot.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.713
Do you remember that?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.932
Yes, I do.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.717
Lorelei Martins.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.720
Correct. Very good.
Good. Your mind is clear.

39:34.807 --> 39:38.811
Now listen, I have a question
for you, Jason.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.160
Look at me.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.031
Look close.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.730
You recognize me?

39:44.817 --> 39:46.427
You ever seen me before?

39:47.602 --> 39:49.038
No.

39:49.125 --> 39:52.346
Are you sure?
It's important.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.566
Yes.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.177
'I'm sure.'

39:57.264 --> 39:59.658
That's good to know.
Thanks.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.184
Who are you?

40:04.271 --> 40:05.925
I'm a friend.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.805
[dramatic music]

40:22.724 --> 40:25.205
Let's face facts, Jason.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.382
If you recover and live

40:28.469 --> 40:30.471
you'll spend life in prison
for murder..

40:30.558 --> 40:32.691
the plaything of monsters.

40:40.002 --> 40:44.093
I just hope that if I'm
ever in your shoes

40:44.180 --> 40:47.662
I have a friend close enough
to do this for me.

40:47.749 --> 40:48.881
Wait.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.320
Don't be scared.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.714
'This'll be quick.'

40:55.801 --> 40:57.455
'Very little pain.'

[gasps]

41:06.246 --> 41:08.074
[beeping]

41:08.161 --> 41:09.945
it's okay.
It's alright.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.599
[gasps]

41:11.686 --> 41:13.949
It's okay.
I'm here for you.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.734
I won't leave you.

He's in v-fib.

Get that crash cart
over here.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.902
What happened?

41:53.989 --> 41:56.296
Patrick, I'm sorry.

41:56.383 --> 41:57.819
His heart gave out.

42:00.561 --> 42:02.041
Never said a word.
