WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:07.675
All aboard!

00:07.708 --> 00:09.043
Do the Fat Tuesday!

00:09.077 --> 00:10.144
Happy Mardi Gras!

00:40.508 --> 00:43.777
Please... please help me.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.446
Back off, buddy.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.501
I got to call my wife.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.636
I got to call...

01:17.478 --> 01:19.113
Please... no.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.890
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:29.923 --> 01:32.526
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:32.560 --> 01:35.263
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.296 --> 01:36.530
* How, how, how, how

01:36.564 --> 01:38.699
* Hey, hey

01:44.538 --> 01:45.706
* You gotta come on.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.179
CASSIUS: You know what they
do for us here at Mardi Gras?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.580
Nothing.

01:52.613 --> 01:57.218
I mean, there's no king
cakes, no festivities.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.819
I tried to convince
a couple of guards

01:58.852 --> 02:00.754
to let us build a float
down in the yard,

02:00.788 --> 02:02.423
but they wouldn't
even hear of it.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.525
They wouldn't even take
that to the warden.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.462
It's underwhelming
to say the least.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.932
Underwhelming is sort of the
point of being incarcerated, no?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.434
Mm.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.436
A little effort's
all I'm asking.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.904
You know,

02:16.937 --> 02:19.807
I remember when
you were five,

02:19.840 --> 02:23.177
uh, maybe six, and I would
take you to the parade,

02:23.211 --> 02:26.180
and I'd put you
up on my shoulders

02:26.214 --> 02:29.217
so you could
see the floats.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.320
Your mama-- she warned me
that you'd had too much to eat

02:32.353 --> 02:33.487
and I'd better
set you down.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.223
Well, the next
thing I know,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.957
there's this big glob
of warm puke sliding...

02:36.990 --> 02:38.526
All right, let's get to it.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.228
Get to what?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.695
The ritual.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.464
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.798
Mardi Gras is six weeks prior

02:44.832 --> 02:47.201
to your annual
parole board hearing.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.204
Every year around this time,
I come here,

02:50.238 --> 02:52.673
we talk about old times,
you bring up my throwing up.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.308
You threw up a lot, Dwayne.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.310
And...

02:56.344 --> 02:58.946
then we get to whether or not
I'm gonna write a letter

02:58.979 --> 03:01.282
to the board
recommending your release.

03:01.315 --> 03:05.253
That would make
a big difference.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.787
You know that.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.756
I mean, people think
less of you as my son

03:08.789 --> 03:10.524
and more of you
as a man of judgment.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.694
Which is why
the answer is still no.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.963
That's fine by me.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.401
No argument?

03:20.434 --> 03:22.303
No pleading your case?

03:22.336 --> 03:25.273
No. I am sanguine.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.745
Work.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.750
Till next time, Cassius.

03:37.818 --> 03:42.723
Laissez les bons temps rouler.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.462
BRODY:
Got some beads there?

03:48.496 --> 03:51.399
In your pocket.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.966
Oh, she put those
in there.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.035
Sly devil.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.739
Been enjoying my annual Krewe
Crawl for the past three weeks.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.542
Krewe De Vieux, Druids, Sparta,
King Arthur and Barkus,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.511
then tonight Orpheus.

04:03.544 --> 04:08.649
Yard-Long Hurricanes, endless
partying, and, yes, beads.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.884
Oh, so you didn't
change your pants?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.487
Three-day-old pants are
a hallmark of the season, Brody.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.424
Sounds like a fraternity kegger
where everyone overindulges

04:16.457 --> 04:18.559
in cutesy drinks
and nipple flashing.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.993
Wasn't always like this.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.063
Early Mardi Gras started
in medieval Europe,

04:23.096 --> 04:27.568
processions of men
honoring "Le Boeuf Gras."

04:27.601 --> 04:29.737
It's a celebration
of the fatted cow.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.740
Far less nipple
flashing, I assure you.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.907
Don't be so
sure of that,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.008
Miss Loretta.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.677
And on that note.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.013
Deceased is Naval Petty Officer
Toussaint Patrice.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.083
WADE:
He was discovered by

04:43.116 --> 04:44.752
a street sweeper
a couple hours ago.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.355
Died of two puncture wounds--
one to the chest...

04:48.556 --> 04:49.557
...one to the stomach.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.427
Robbery?
Not likely.

04:53.461 --> 04:57.064
Still wearing his wedding band,
wallet was flush with cash,

04:57.097 --> 04:58.799
broken cell phone on the ground.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.335
NOPD said they spoke
to a drunk tourist.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.537
They said he saw
Toussaint running from

05:03.571 --> 05:07.475
a man wearing
a jester mask.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.977
Said the killer was between
five-four and five-nine.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.679
That's quite a range there,
King.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.349
Let me emphasize the words
"drunk" and then "tourist."

05:15.383 --> 05:17.785
Good point.
Lots of cameras.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.987
PRIDE: Have Patton download
the Eagle Eye from last night.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.722
Texting him now.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.393
This trail
of blood spots indicates

05:25.426 --> 05:27.060
Toussaint was stabbed
somewhere else.

05:27.094 --> 05:31.365
Well, if he was partying
on St. Charles Street,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.667
then that means...

05:38.672 --> 05:41.809
Clubbing at the Glitter Ball.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.411
Glitter Ball.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.645
Hosted by the
Krewe of Yemoja

05:44.678 --> 05:45.913
every year on
Bacchus Sunday.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.515
Are you even speaking English?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.050
In order: Bacchus Sunday,
Monday is Lundi Gras,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.719
then Fat Tuesday
aka Mardi Gras.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.454
You'll get it soon.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.023
Let's lock down the place,
canvass everyone inside.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.427
We find who was wearing that
jester mask, we find our killer.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.994
Doubt that's gonna work.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.096
Why not?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.912
I see your kegger
and raise you

06:18.946 --> 06:22.082
the Greatest Freak
Show on Earth.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.517
*

06:40.901 --> 06:41.869
Well, let me know.
Sure.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.036
BRODY:
Okay, thank you.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.005
Swept every room down here.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.741
No blood found, but I did
encounter a number of fluids

06:47.775 --> 06:50.711
that I've decided
to let Lasalle investigate.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.581
It's my first Mardi Gras;
trying to ease my way in.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.915
LASALLE:
Pride, Brody.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.154
Talked to a couple witnesses
who were here all night.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.657
Showed them Toussaint's
driver's license photo.

07:03.691 --> 07:07.661
Said they saw Toussaint being
thrown out of the V.I.P. area

07:07.695 --> 07:09.563
up on the second floor
around midnight.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.164
There was some
sort of fight.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.133
About?
Spilled drink.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.603
This way.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.571
Witnesses said that the guy
that Toussaint fought with

07:17.605 --> 07:20.841
was African-American, well
dressed and over six feet tall.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.111
That's taller than we heard
out on the street.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.181
PRIDE:
Huh.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.552
Think I might have found where
our victim was first stabbed.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.854
Look like blood?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.489
Yep.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.598
Broken piece of glass.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.801
OFFICER:
Agent Pride.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.637
What do you got?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.271
There's a woman downstairs
asking after Toussaint.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.707
Think it's his wife.
All right, tell her
I'll be right down.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.211
Track down the V.I.P. list.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.914
Whoever Toussaint was
fighting with is on it.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.249
Run the names.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.084
See who matches the description.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.686
I'll drop the
blood and glass

08:05.719 --> 08:06.787
to Loretta and Sebastian.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.724
When he left
last night, he...

08:10.758 --> 08:14.662
he said he was
going to a meeting.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.897
He'd been acting erratic--

08:16.930 --> 08:19.767
not telling me where
he was going, coming home late.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.901
I saw the signs,

08:20.934 --> 08:23.136
I just didn't know what to do.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.673
This...

08:25.706 --> 08:27.775
last place he should've been.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.677
Why?

08:31.745 --> 08:35.082
He'd been sober three years.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.817
This morning,

08:36.850 --> 08:40.754
when I woke up and he wasn't
next to me, I looked outside,

08:40.788 --> 08:42.723
saw that his car was gone, I...

08:42.756 --> 08:47.127
used the Cell Locator app.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.799
Led me here.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.266
His car

08:53.300 --> 08:55.803
An old Chevy Impala.
Did you find it?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.708
Can I at least have his keys?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.610
I'll track it down.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.112
Didn't have keys on him.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.249
We'll take care of the car.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.752
In the meantime,

09:11.785 --> 09:13.587
I'll have someone take you home.
Officer.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.756
Can you give Miss Patrice
a ride home, please?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.791
No problem.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.770
What would possess
him to come here?

09:33.741 --> 09:36.744
To take a chance
being around all this?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.651
WADE:
Running a tox screen

09:43.684 --> 09:45.052
on Petty Officer Patrice.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.220
Results won't be ready
for another 48 hours,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.256
but it'll tell us
if he was on something.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.760
This time of year is hardest
on those prone to temptation.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.228
We're all prone
to temptation, Dwayne.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.265
That's what makes our species
so interesting.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.400
Now that I've been able

10:00.433 --> 10:04.304
to investigate, wounds are from
a three- to five-inch blade,

10:04.337 --> 10:05.806
serrated edge.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.241
I sent the measurements
to Sebastian.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.811
And the timelines
of the stabbings

10:10.844 --> 10:12.746
matches what
your witnesses reported.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.314
Time of death was
around midnight.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.284
So Petty Officer Patrice
meets his killer

10:17.317 --> 10:19.820
at the V.I.P. area.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.755
First attack happens,

10:21.789 --> 10:25.225
he flees, killer follows him
into the streets,

10:25.258 --> 10:26.927
finishes him there.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.799
Any updates from Sebastian
about the broken piece of glass?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.303
That means "Happy Mardi Gras"
in Shyriiwook.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.805
It's the official language
of Chewbacca.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.874
Sebastian has
been anointed

10:40.908 --> 10:45.345
the Chief Overlord
of the Krewe of Chewbacchus.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.880
Second year in a row.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.315
Quite an honor, I'm sure.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.150
You have no idea.
It's-it's really huge.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.119
Anyway, uh, in regards
to the glass,

10:52.152 --> 10:54.888
I'm still unsure of its origin,
but I'll continue to run tests.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.324
I can rule out
bottle and wine glass.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.693
It's too fine,
plus the bevel's all wrong.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.094
But I used the,
uh, measurements

11:01.128 --> 11:02.963
from Toussaint's wounds
to determine

11:02.996 --> 11:05.766
that he was stabbed with
a Benchmade steel knife.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.702
Keep me posted about the glass.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.940
That means "Will do."

11:12.973 --> 11:14.407
Or "Where's the library?"

11:14.441 --> 11:16.209
I don't know.
It's a very subtle language.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.917
Hey, baby girl.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
Hi.
You're early.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.055
Well, I finished my econ paper
last night, so I made sure that

11:28.088 --> 11:30.090
Orion got to physical therapy--
he's doing great by the way.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.259
Good.
And then I hopped on
the 9:00 a.m. bus.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.828
Are you sure you don't
mind if I borrow your car?

11:34.862 --> 11:35.963
Comes with a price.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.431
Where are you off to?

11:38.465 --> 11:39.900
We're supposed to be having

11:39.933 --> 11:41.802
our Pride family
bead-necklace-making party,

11:41.835 --> 11:43.737
and from what I hear,
it's an exclusive

11:43.771 --> 11:45.739
father-daughter affair.
Oh, I'm there. Tonight.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.808
I even brought a new supply
of beads as a surprise.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.309
Oh, nice.
It's just that

11:49.342 --> 11:51.444
I have a chance to get together
with Lundy tonight.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.880
You remember Lundy.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.015
Uh, drummer from
your high school jazz band.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.750
We're having a small reunion.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.886
Rhythm section's
got to stick together.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.288
Thought she was
studying in Europe.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.223
Yeah, she was,
but, um, she's back now.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.927
Do you mind if I take these?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.028
I want to look more festive.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.997
Sure.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.464
I'll be back before dinner.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.465
All right.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.267
Bye. Have fun.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.306
Chris. Merri.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.942
Hey, Laurel.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.911
Everything all right?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.046
Double-edged sword
being a cop.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.916
You know when people
are lying to you.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.550
You got the V.I.P. list?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.319
Sure did.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.021
Owner of the club couldn't
have been more helpful.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.056
Just handed it over to us
like that, easy-peasy.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.092
Russell Jaynes is the
owner of the club--

12:39.126 --> 12:41.061
aka Screwy Douce.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.930
Part-time rapper and
used to move bricks

12:42.963 --> 12:44.364
back during
my vice days.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.933
BRODY: Matches the
description of the man

12:45.966 --> 12:47.034
who was fighting Toussaint--

12:47.067 --> 12:48.568
over six feet,
African-American.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.970
They have a past?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.104
LASALLE: Not that
we know of, yet.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.807
But we did get a
tip from a clubgoer

12:53.841 --> 12:55.442
who swears he
saw Screwy Douce

12:55.475 --> 12:56.944
in the V.I.P. bathroom.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.545
He was washing blood
off his hands.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.049
PRIDE:
2003, you were accused

13:02.082 --> 13:03.951
of a felonious assault
for stabbing a man

13:03.984 --> 13:05.252
in a fit of road rage.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.854
And six months later,
you escaped

13:06.887 --> 13:09.356
reckless endangerment charges
for stabbing a man

13:09.389 --> 13:11.091
who whistled
at your girlfriend.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.962
And then in 2009,
you were finally convicted

13:14.995 --> 13:18.465
for stabbing a man for
scuffing up your Stacy Adams.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.934
Didn't scuff my Stacy Adams.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.269
Bent my hat brim.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.972
If you're gonna
disparage,

13:25.005 --> 13:26.974
at least have the respect
to be accurate.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.342
Least we can do, Mr. Douce.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.946
Mr. Douce was the old me.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.848
I've changed.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.049
I'm a businessman now.

13:36.083 --> 13:40.087
Please use the name
my mother intended:

13:40.120 --> 13:41.354
Russell.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.091
Okay, Russell, explain to us

13:44.124 --> 13:45.993
how it is
that this petty officer

13:46.026 --> 13:47.560
you were seen
fighting with was found

13:47.594 --> 13:49.296
stabbed to death in an alley.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.465
This fool was bleeding
way before he got to me.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.034
That so?

13:54.067 --> 13:58.005
I was up in V.I.P.
hanging with my homies.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.373
I left to get myself a libation.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.009
When I returned,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.111
saw this guy
stumbling toward me.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.545
Next thing I know,

14:05.578 --> 14:09.249
he falls, drops his crazy mask,

14:09.282 --> 14:12.652
runs into me, knocked
my drink all over me.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
I was pissed.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.158
So I cop to
roughing him up a bit.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.093
I had to regulate.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.194
Regulate as in...?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.265
Ask politely.
Okay.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.599
So, your story:

14:26.633 --> 14:27.968
Petty Officer Patrice

14:28.001 --> 14:29.302
comes down the
stairs bleeding,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.504
holding some kind of
jester mask in his hand.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.007
Jester mask? No.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.976
After he bumped
into me,

14:36.009 --> 14:38.045
he dropped a mask,

14:38.078 --> 14:40.013
but it was a different
kind of mask altogether.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.314
What kind of mask?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.917
Dude was carrying a gas mask.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.622
LASALLE:
There's no record of a gas mask

14:49.656 --> 14:50.958
found on the scene.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.325
Yeah, well, dude wasn't lying.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.327
I used Toussaint's time of death
to narrow down

14:54.361 --> 14:56.263
my search of
the Central Business District's

14:56.296 --> 14:58.665
surveillance camera footage and
the videos from inside the club.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.434
How'd you get into
the Saturn's Feast party

15:01.468 --> 15:03.270
I was stuck outside.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.506
When you roll like I roll,
you can get in anywhere.
Can we

15:06.539 --> 15:07.607
get back to this club?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.142
They didn't have
any cameras.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.343
But you didn't need 'em,

15:10.377 --> 15:12.112
thanks to everybody
living their life

15:12.145 --> 15:14.047
so loud and proud
on social media.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.349
I isolated every video clip
labeled hashtag

15:16.383 --> 15:18.051
Glitter Masquerade Party

15:18.085 --> 15:19.052
on Instagram,
Facebook and Twitter.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.988
I built
an image timeline

15:21.021 --> 15:23.390
of Toussaint's night--
I call it

15:23.423 --> 15:25.692
the Patton Effect.
Humble.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.961
The images are random,
because most of the footage

15:27.995 --> 15:30.130
is cut together from
the selfie brigade.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.165
It's shocking how people
are so into themselves.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.101
They don't even bother
to notice there's a murder.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.736
Okay, this is the moment
right before Douce of Screwy

15:36.769 --> 15:38.638
crashed into your victim
on the stairs.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.274
And as you notice,
Petty Officer Patrice

15:41.308 --> 15:44.111
already had bloodstains
on his shirt.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.745
Consistent with
what we were told.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.248
Based on what you said
about the mask,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.083
I zoomed in on
his left hand.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.418
Let me enhance
this puppy.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.986
BRODY:
There.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.988
That's serious. Tactical.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.256
Silicone facepiece.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.624
Mesh harness suspension.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.192
The guy wasn't
Screwy-Doucing around.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.061
Hang on.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.362
Lasalle here.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.998
All right, so Toussaint's
at a party,

16:05.032 --> 16:07.367
carrying a gas mask.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.070
Any theories?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.339
I have a bondage sex story
I could tell you,

16:12.372 --> 16:13.506
but it would probably

16:13.540 --> 16:14.641
be more entertaining

16:14.674 --> 16:15.642
than informative.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.577
That was NOPD.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.480
BOLO got a hit
on Toussaint's car.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.152
PRIDE:
Keys are still in the ignition.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.320
LASALLE:
Looks like somebody
dumped it and humped it.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.089
BRODY:
I'll check for prints.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.124
Pop the trunk.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.297
Hello.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.771
:
Unmarked gas canisters.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.777
With a million and a half
tourists in town for Mardi Gras,

16:50.810 --> 16:55.715
it'd be a bad time for
something to go boom.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.626
Bomb Squad called an audible.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.695
The gas canisters
we found in Toussaint's car

17:08.728 --> 17:10.830
aren't explosive
or chemical weapons.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.665
Then, what are they?

17:12.699 --> 17:13.500
Isoflurane.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.168
Anesthetic doctors give

17:15.202 --> 17:16.803
to their patients
undergoing surgery.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.705
Toussaint's no doctor.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.207
Also ran
the serial numbers

17:20.240 --> 17:22.209
on these canisters--
turns out to be part

17:22.242 --> 17:24.677
of stolen inventory
from the Algiers
Medical Supply Warehouse

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
a day before
Toussaint was killed.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.516
Drug addicts have been known
to steal iso for huffing.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.783
Where's that leave the gas mask?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.719
With the filter on,

17:32.752 --> 17:34.787
it keeps the isoflurane out.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.689
Filter off--

17:36.723 --> 17:39.492
it's the perfect siphon
for a huff.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.562
Which could make Toussaint's
killer his drug buddy.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.796
Maybe the two
got high together,

17:43.830 --> 17:45.598
went on a Mardi Gras binge.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.167
Ended up in Screwy
Douce's club,

17:47.200 --> 17:49.136
something goes wrong
and there's a fight.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.671
Drug buddy stabs him
and steals his car.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.806
But the quantity of canisters

17:53.840 --> 17:55.742
found in the trunk
of Toussaint's car--

17:55.775 --> 17:57.610
excessive for a user.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.412
And dangerous--
people could be killed

17:59.446 --> 18:02.582
via sedation if all those
canisters are opened at once.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.550
Maybe they planned to sell.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.784
Isoflurane
can bring

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
a pretty penny
on the black market.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.590
Head over to the Algiers
Medical Supply Warehouse.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.826
See if you can find out more
about the robbery.

18:13.860 --> 18:17.264
I'll go talk
to Toussaint's wife.

18:17.297 --> 18:21.701
Maybe he picked up a new friend
with his new behavior.

18:25.372 --> 18:29.276
Toussaint and I were trying
to start a family.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.812
Oh. We should have been shopping
for baby cribs this year.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.648
But instead
I'll be shopping

18:35.682 --> 18:38.351
for my husband's coffin.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.660
I'm sorry to ask, but, uh...

18:47.694 --> 18:50.863
is there a chance your
husband might've relapsed?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.402
We had a hard year.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.769
Meaning?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.772
With me being unemployed and...

18:59.806 --> 19:02.609
Toussaint's telemarketing job
not bringing in much,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
we fell behind.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.780
One of the reasons we'd put
a pin in starting our family.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.253
Was there anybody
Toussaint was...

19:13.286 --> 19:14.854
hanging out with, new?

19:14.887 --> 19:16.389
Sketchy?

19:16.423 --> 19:19.326
I wouldn't say "sketchy," but...

19:19.359 --> 19:23.396
if you're talking about
potential influences...

19:23.430 --> 19:28.301
Toussaint started volunteering
at a sober living facility.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.437
Sober living?

19:30.470 --> 19:34.674
My husband served
three tours in Iraq.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.645
He came back home
numb, distant.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.481
Found a release
in his addiction.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.785
But he turned his life around,
he fought his way back to me,

19:45.818 --> 19:49.422
and he wanted to be of service
to others just like him.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.825
From being of service to...

19:52.859 --> 19:56.629
serving up drugs...

19:56.663 --> 20:01.368
I guess people never really do
change, do they, Agent Pride?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.804
There's always hope.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.778
Said they'd send a patrol out
to investigate my break-in,

20:11.811 --> 20:14.547
but they never did.
Well, it's the
season, ma'am.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.683
Everybody's got
their hands full.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.351
Thieves broke in here.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.919
Looks like they used a crowbar.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.355
Got away with
one carton of isoflurane.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.491
Just the isoflurane?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.559
Mm-hmm. And they skipped
right on past the oxycodone

20:26.593 --> 20:28.695
and all the good stuff
to get to it.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.831
Not the same high as the others,
but it would still command

20:31.864 --> 20:33.633
a few grand
on the black market.
Cameras catch

20:33.666 --> 20:35.001
the break
Did, but it ain't

20:35.034 --> 20:37.704
gonna be much help--
robber was wearing a hoodie.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.739
We'd still like to take a peek,
if you don't mind.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.807
Whatever's clever.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.809
My office is this way.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.010
I'll tell you this,

20:44.043 --> 20:46.546
whoever he is
been very busy.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
My competitor,
First Charity Medical Supply,

20:48.948 --> 20:52.919
got robbed of three boxes
of isoflurane just last night.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.758
O-Okay, Chris, just check out
that other isoflurane robbery.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.792
LASALLE:
I'll get on it, King.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.761
See what you can run down, okay?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.896
All right,
you about done there tonight?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.898
No, I got a...

21:05.932 --> 21:08.801
I got an interrogation
I got to take care of here.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.337
Got you.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.510
So, I started
another strand.
I'm thinking

21:17.544 --> 21:19.346
maybe we can use
the red beads

21:19.379 --> 21:21.414
in combination with
the little glass yellow ones.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.915
We need to talk.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.651
About?

21:24.684 --> 21:25.818
Why you're really here.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.755
Now, I considered
the possibilities

21:28.788 --> 21:30.423
that you...

21:30.457 --> 21:32.425
dropped out of school,

21:32.459 --> 21:34.060
you and Orion
eloped, or...

21:34.093 --> 21:36.629
maybe I'd have to kill Orion
because he got you...

21:36.663 --> 21:38.431
:
Dad, I'm not pregnant.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.032
I know.

21:45.372 --> 21:48.708
First...

21:48.741 --> 21:50.710
this thread from your sweater.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.911
Typically,

21:51.944 --> 21:53.913
you tug on your clothing

21:53.946 --> 21:56.949
when you have an increased
level of anxiety.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.821
Next, the overextended
mileage on my odometer

22:01.854 --> 22:03.556
tells me that...

22:03.590 --> 22:05.892
you went 20 miles...

22:05.925 --> 22:08.428
each way on your...

22:08.461 --> 22:10.463
"trip with Lundy,"

22:10.497 --> 22:12.565
even though she lives...

22:12.599 --> 22:14.634
right in the Quarter.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.068
This... is insane.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.070
You're checking the mileage
on your vehicle.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.639
And finally...

22:21.040 --> 22:25.578
...the red bead necklace
that you're wearing.

22:25.612 --> 22:28.381
One you've never noticed before.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.983
My father's favorite.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.756
How long have you and Cassius
been communicating?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.892
I want my lawyer?

22:40.927 --> 22:43.062
Doesn't work that way.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.401
Not with fathers and daughters.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.843
I found him using
the Offender Locator Web site

22:56.876 --> 22:58.845
for Gretna a few years ago.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.648
And at first we just started
writing to each other,

23:01.681 --> 23:03.683
but then that graduated
to telephone calls,

23:03.716 --> 23:06.986
and then... last year
I went to see him
for the first time.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.657
And you kept this from me?
Because I knew you
were gonna react like this!

23:10.690 --> 23:12.058
Ever since
I was a little girl,

23:12.091 --> 23:14.160
you always told me these
funny stories about Grandpa,

23:14.193 --> 23:15.928
but you never once
took me to see him.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.764
You were a little girl!
Which I'm not anymore.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.165
Laurel...
Daddy, you're a respected cop--

23:19.198 --> 23:20.867
a letter from you would make
all the difference

23:20.900 --> 23:23.870
in a parole hearing.
He's hocking you for the letter?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.072
You always told me to look
for the best in people, right?

23:26.105 --> 23:27.440
To forgive?

23:27.474 --> 23:28.841
Well, why can't you
forgive him?

23:28.875 --> 23:29.909
It's not that simple.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.444
Daddy...
Laurel,

23:31.478 --> 23:33.513
this is for your own good.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.147
You are not to write him,

23:35.181 --> 23:37.584
call him, you are not to
visit him in prison again.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.719
Am I making myself clear?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.524
I'm sorry.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.992
It doesn't work like that

23:46.025 --> 23:48.728
between fathers
and adult daughters.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.134
SEBASTIAN:
No, man, you're missing
the point entirely.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.703
PATTON: While you were
chanting "Chewbacchus,"

23:56.736 --> 23:58.938
I was screaming
"Boobs-shocka-locka."

23:58.971 --> 24:00.907
What are you two
arguing about now?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.543
Patton was kicked off
the Intergalactic Krewe

24:03.576 --> 24:05.177
of Chewbacchus last year
for wearing an elf shirt...

24:05.211 --> 24:07.480
Permissible cyborg elf shirt.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.115
You can't just wrap
your arm in tin foil

24:09.148 --> 24:11.083
and claim that
you're a cyborg.
Point is moot.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.252
Chewbacchus ain't got nothing
on the Red Beads and Rice Krewe

24:13.285 --> 24:14.654
or the Krewe of Beyoncé.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.155
SEBASTIAN: This is
our Berlin Wall,

24:16.188 --> 24:17.957
and you're standing on the
east side-- that makes you

24:17.990 --> 24:19.191
and Beyoncé
Communists, so...

24:19.225 --> 24:21.694
Please, someone,
save me from this madness.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.696
Well, all right, here we go.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.533
So, all that was visible
from the supply warehouse
surveillance

24:26.566 --> 24:28.835
was the intruder's hand.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.103
But sometimes
a hand's all you need.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.139
We took an image
of Toussaint's killer's hand

24:33.172 --> 24:35.141
from the alley surveillance
footage to compare.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.876
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, FBI has

24:36.909 --> 24:39.145
a, uh, Vascular
Mapping Program.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.649
It uses vein patterns
as a biometric trait
for identification.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.851
So, by applying
an Oriented Gradient Map

24:44.884 --> 24:49.121
to the killer's and the
burglar's hands, they match.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.990
We take the vein patterns
and the coriums

24:51.023 --> 24:53.292
and feed them
into the FBI's database, and...

24:53.325 --> 24:54.961
SEBASTIAN:
Cowabunga--

24:54.994 --> 24:56.663
there's your burglar.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.931
Cyd Lawson, released
from Gretna State Prison

24:58.965 --> 25:00.667
last October
after serving ten years

25:00.700 --> 25:02.101
for bank robbery.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.570
You got that list of people
Petty Officer Patrice

25:03.603 --> 25:06.639
is working with at the
sober living facility?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.307
He's on it.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.643
: I'll get
Cyd's last known address.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.978
I'm calling Pride.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.650
:
I'm going in.

25:17.684 --> 25:18.851
LASALLE :
Copy.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.019
I'm at the side door.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.153
BRODY:
I'm at the back.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.670
NCIS. Open up.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.660
:
Hey, Pride.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.068
Meth lab.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.393
Knife!

26:34.426 --> 26:35.995
MAN:
Stay back.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.132
Stay back!
PRIDE:
Cyd, put the knife down.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.704
You come near me,
I'll cut you!

26:46.939 --> 26:49.108
Put down the knife, Cyd.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.278
It's not my fault.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.682
They made me kill him.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.183
They?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.185
Who's "they," Cyd?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.854
:
Mm-mm. I can't tell.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.257
I can't tell.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.326
Oh, hey.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.896
Cyd, stay with me, buddy.
Stay with me.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.430
What was Toussaint
gonna snitch on?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.432
Cyd. Cyd.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.701
The isoflurane?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.068
Come on, Cyd.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.403
The heist...

27:17.436 --> 27:19.972
tomorrow...

27:21.841 --> 27:23.275
Mardi...

27:32.251 --> 27:34.253
He's gone.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.824
Did he say "heist"?

27:37.857 --> 27:39.892
On Mardi Gras?

27:42.128 --> 27:44.831
Official start of the big day.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.235
Clock is ticking.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.853
WADE:
The cause of death
for Cyd Lawson was a stroke.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.988
Likely caused
by a crystal meth-induced

28:09.021 --> 28:10.189
heart arrhythmia.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.457
From an O.D.?

28:11.490 --> 28:13.459
Based on track marks, Mr. Lawson

28:13.492 --> 28:16.963
injected a significant amount
of the drug into his system.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.866
Most users prefer to smoke it,
because injection

28:19.899 --> 28:22.935
raises the possibility
of an overdose exponentially.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.337
Are you saying the O.D.
was intentional?

28:25.371 --> 28:28.975
I'm saying Mr. Lawson,
as an experienced drug user,

28:29.008 --> 28:31.410
would have known better.
He said that

28:31.443 --> 28:33.179
they made him kill Toussaint.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.482
The knife you found with him
matches the murder weapon.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.185
So... possible.
Thank you, Loretta.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.454
Followed up on that second
isoflurane robbery.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.490
Owner says three
boxes were stolen.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.926
That's 27 canisters, King--

28:46.959 --> 28:48.861
enough to kill a
couple hundred people.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.764
So, if what Cyd was saying
is true-- a heist

28:51.798 --> 28:53.232
on Mardi Gras,

28:53.265 --> 28:54.834
NOPD's stretched
to the limit--

28:54.867 --> 28:56.969
perfect time to steal
something in plain sight.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.138
Possible targets:
casinos, banks,

28:59.171 --> 29:01.808
strip clubs...
Any idea who Cyd
was working with?

29:01.841 --> 29:05.244
I had Patton dump
Cyd's phone.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.980
His "friends" is a motley crew
of violent criminals.

29:08.014 --> 29:11.784
Ian Knox, Marv Williams,
and Randy James.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.252
Ian Knox

29:13.285 --> 29:16.355
was convicted too many times
to count on robbery.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.057
James, he's partial

29:18.090 --> 29:19.158
to home invasions.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.359
Marv Williams?

29:20.392 --> 29:21.427
He's the likely
mastermind

29:21.460 --> 29:22.461
of the pack.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.930
Convicted of manslaughter

29:23.963 --> 29:25.331
and robbery.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.033
Know where to find
these Boy Scouts?

29:27.066 --> 29:27.834
No cell phone usage,

29:27.867 --> 29:29.902
credit card movements,

29:29.936 --> 29:32.438
and their last known addresses
are post office boxes.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.506
I put out a BOLO.
Sebastian.

29:34.540 --> 29:38.477
Got an update on that
piece of glass we found
at the crime scene.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.914
All right, you grab Brody...

29:41.948 --> 29:44.350
follow up over there.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.053
I'm gonna head to Gretna,

29:47.086 --> 29:48.988
have a talk with one of...

29:49.021 --> 29:51.958
Marv's cell block buddies.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.326
CASSIUS:
Twice in one week?

29:54.360 --> 29:57.163
To what do I owe
the extra attention?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.198
Marv Williams.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.001
He was on your cell block.
Any contact with him?

30:02.034 --> 30:03.069
Of course.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.403
What can you tell me?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.038
Plenty.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.573
Okay, what can you tell me

30:07.606 --> 30:10.009
about what he might steal today,

30:10.042 --> 30:11.510
Mardi Gras?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.479
Today, huh?

30:13.512 --> 30:16.348
It seems like we have arrived

30:16.382 --> 30:20.953
at one of those mutual
back-scratching scenarios.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.855
Answer's still no.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.223
Okay, then.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.557
Guard,

30:25.591 --> 30:26.893
time to go.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.594
You leave now...

30:28.627 --> 30:30.162
I'll make sure you never

30:30.196 --> 30:32.932
see Laurel again.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.103
Uh, one more minute, actually.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.576
It doesn't work that way,
Dwayne.

30:44.610 --> 30:48.147
Kids grow up,
they have a mind of their own.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.182
Suddenly,
they do what they want,

30:50.216 --> 30:52.351
regardless
of their father's wishes.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.254
And regardless
of who I am to you,

30:55.287 --> 30:58.157
I am still her grandpapa.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.359
'Cause I chose
which stories to tell her

31:00.392 --> 31:03.262
and which ones to leave out.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.198
I can fill in the details,

31:06.232 --> 31:09.635
regale her with darker tales...

31:09.668 --> 31:13.172
about the envelopes of money
delivered to our house,

31:13.205 --> 31:16.008
or the many women
who were not her grandmother...

31:16.042 --> 31:18.144
All right, your
mother and I,

31:18.177 --> 31:19.311
we had an arrangement.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.280
Which would explain
her nervous breakdown.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.916
And why she had to move
halfway around the globe

31:23.950 --> 31:26.285
to get away from you.
You ungrateful, spoiled...

31:26.318 --> 31:29.488
Or how about I tell her
my most vivid Mardi Gras memory,

31:29.521 --> 31:32.058
where a king cake
was delivered to our house,

31:32.091 --> 31:35.327
and the prize inside--
a severed finger. Good times.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.998
You think she'll still think
of you as her grandpapa
once she knows that?

31:39.031 --> 31:40.566
Now, you may not believe this...

31:40.599 --> 31:43.069
but the reason
I won't write you a letter

31:43.102 --> 31:45.304
is 'cause I'm convinced
that this is the only place

31:45.337 --> 31:48.174
I can keep you where
you'll be safe from yourself.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.943
And now I'm done.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.413
Dwayne. Wait. Wait.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.120
If I was a betting man,

32:01.153 --> 32:04.523
I'd say what you're
looking for is jewels.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.298
The piece of glass?

32:12.331 --> 32:14.266
It's from a broken
telephoto smartphone lens,

32:14.300 --> 32:16.102
similar to this one.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.637
It provides the viewer
with 15 times the power of zoom,

32:18.670 --> 32:20.672
all while coming
from a device that fits

32:20.706 --> 32:23.309
conveniently
into your pocket.
So looking at a distance

32:23.342 --> 32:25.344
without appearing
too conspicuous.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.046
So Toussaint found out

32:27.079 --> 32:28.347
Cyd was up to something,

32:28.380 --> 32:31.117
tracked him down at the club...
Cyd was there,

32:31.150 --> 32:32.318
telephoto lens...

32:32.351 --> 32:34.753
Scouting a potential heist.
Could be.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.655
How do you say "great job"
in Wookie?

32:38.357 --> 32:40.026
Yeah. That.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.463
*

32:57.576 --> 33:00.079
BRODY:
So, let's say Toussaint
is in on this heist.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.081
Possibly wanted out,
got cold feet.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.250
He goes from loving husband
and potential father

33:04.283 --> 33:06.218
to fallen addict
and jewel thief?

33:06.252 --> 33:08.454
Happy Mardi Gras, Ms. Patrice.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.358
What do you see?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.525
Those two lofts over there,

33:13.559 --> 33:14.760
that's where the Krewe of Rex

33:14.793 --> 33:16.162
and the Krewe of Comus

33:16.195 --> 33:17.796
showcase their gowns
and scepters

33:17.829 --> 33:19.231
at preview balls.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.699
No expensive jewelry there.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.534
What about that building?
Mystic Krewe

33:22.568 --> 33:25.304
of Shangri-La Social Club--
they hold their

33:25.337 --> 33:27.373
St. Charles gala luncheon
at a meeting center.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.341
Again, no significant
jewelry there?

33:29.375 --> 33:30.642
Nope.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.445
But across the street,
dead ahead...

33:33.479 --> 33:35.147
at the Board of Trade,

33:35.181 --> 33:36.715
the Wiley Museum of Southern Art

33:36.748 --> 33:38.650
holds their "Get on
the Good Foot" gala fund-raiser.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.119
Old money.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.353
Guests wearing their Sunday best

33:41.387 --> 33:42.821
and estate jewelry.

33:42.854 --> 33:43.822
Let's gear up.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.325
We're gonna need
gas masks.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.660
*

34:04.210 --> 34:06.378
That's a beautiful necklace
you're wearing.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.514
Thank you.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.527
Let's go.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.305
*

34:40.479 --> 34:41.680
All right, I got the front.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.415
Brody, take the back.
Christopher...

34:43.449 --> 34:45.151
I got the side.
Right. Talk to me.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.252
You got it.

34:46.285 --> 34:49.755
*

35:02.768 --> 35:05.137
King, I'm in.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.412
I'm in position.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.806
Yeah, I need several EMT trucks
at the Board of Trade.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.708
We got people down.
Let's move.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.679
Whoo!
Come here.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.885
Come on, come on.
Please.

35:59.425 --> 36:02.728
Easy. I'm gonna
drop my weapon.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.189
Move, move!

36:44.270 --> 36:45.637
Got your punk ass.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.815
BRODY:
Stay down!

37:04.790 --> 37:05.791
NCIS.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.327
Party's over.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.964
You all right?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

37:15.801 --> 37:16.768
You all right, Chris?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.804
Isoflurane.
Some potent stuff.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.273
Merideth Brody,

37:21.307 --> 37:23.809
I feel fantastic.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.446
I got to tell you, no buzz
like this on my Krewe Crawl.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.880
Okay, all right,

37:28.914 --> 37:30.816
ca-calm, calm down.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.856
This is the first one that you
and Daddy made together, right?

37:37.889 --> 37:39.057
It is.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.926
He was four.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.761
Do you want to put it on?

37:42.794 --> 37:44.930
Oh, I'd like to,
but, uh, you know...

37:44.963 --> 37:46.798
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.867
:
I forgot.
So you're going

37:48.900 --> 37:49.935
back to school tomorrow?

37:49.968 --> 37:52.771
Yeah. I have an exam on Friday.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.540
And then you'll write again?

37:54.573 --> 37:55.741
Write?

37:56.775 --> 37:57.843
Me.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.878
Like

38:01.480 --> 38:03.815
That's... complicated.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.853
Daddy?

38:10.789 --> 38:13.058
Where are we
leaving this, Dwayne?

38:14.893 --> 38:18.764
Laurel, I think it's time
I told you a story about

38:18.797 --> 38:19.965
your grandfather.
Dwayne...

38:19.998 --> 38:21.933
When I was five...

38:21.967 --> 38:24.736
maybe six...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.972
your grandpop took me
to the parade...

38:27.005 --> 38:29.775
put me up on
his shoulders.

38:29.808 --> 38:30.976
So you could see the floats.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.978
:
And you threw up all over him.

38:33.011 --> 38:36.715
I know this one.
What I don't think
I ever told you was...

38:36.748 --> 38:39.050
he barely took a moment
to clean off.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.886
He put me down,

38:40.919 --> 38:43.689
he didn't get mad, and then...

38:43.722 --> 38:46.992
right back up on his shoulders.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.596
Made sure I didn't miss
a single float.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.578
Tell the one about...

39:06.612 --> 39:08.580
the time they asked you

39:08.614 --> 39:10.015
to be Rex,

39:10.048 --> 39:12.050
the King of Carnival.
Oh.

39:13.419 --> 39:16.455
Yeah, it was...
it was 1986.

39:16.488 --> 39:20.926
Gary Rome nominated me
to be the King.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.728
Now, that was
a big surprise,

39:22.761 --> 39:25.063
because I wasn't even a member
of one of the Krewes.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.933
But they were trying
to lure me in.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.769
There were lots of guys
who were members of the Krewes

39:30.802 --> 39:32.971
back in those days who
wanted to be associated

39:33.004 --> 39:35.106
with Cassius Pride.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.109
*

39:42.047 --> 39:44.550
This is as it should be--

39:44.583 --> 39:46.752
family coming together
on Mardi Gras

39:46.785 --> 39:49.120
to enjoy and celebrate!

39:49.154 --> 39:50.922
So, I pulled some strings,

39:50.956 --> 39:52.958
and I got you
reinstated.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.994
Here's an official T-shirt
of the Intergalactic Krewe

39:56.027 --> 39:56.962
of Chewbacchus.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.564
Go on, take it.

40:00.666 --> 40:01.800
Don't mention it.
