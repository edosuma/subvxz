00:16.999 --> 00:21.867
<i>Hidden away inside a computer
exists another world.</i>

00:21.901 --> 00:24.973
<i>Its creator designed it for games.</i>

00:27.846 --> 00:30.114
<i>But it became so much more.</i>

00:31.991 --> 00:35.127
<i>He called it the Grid...</i>

00:35.161 --> 00:39.939
<i>A digital utopia filled
with infinite possibilities.</i>

00:39.973 --> 00:44.218
<i>He built a digital copy
of himself named Clu</i>

00:44.252 --> 00:47.924
<i>to help create the perfect system.</i>

00:51.297 --> 00:55.803
<i>And he relied on the hero
Tron to keep it free</i>

00:55.838 --> 00:59.813
<i>for all programs who live there.</i>

00:59.847 --> 01:02.817
<i>But in his thirst for power,
Clu betrayed his creator.</i>

01:02.851 --> 01:05.254
Flynn, go.

01:05.289 --> 01:07.960
<i>Tron fought back.</i>

01:07.995 --> 01:11.064
<i>Clu was too powerful
and left him for dead.</i>

01:11.099 --> 01:12.266
Aah!

01:14.872 --> 01:19.111
<i>Clu dispatched his armies
and seized absolute control.</i>

01:21.047 --> 01:24.051
<i>Now
in a far off corner of the Grid,</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:29.823
<i>A young program decides
Clu must be stopped.</i>

01:29.858 --> 01:32.092
<i>His name is Beck.</i>

01:32.127 --> 01:34.261
<i>Could he be the next Tron?</i>

01:41.672 --> 01:51.172
<b>S01E01 - Beck's Beginning</b>

02:00.277 --> 02:03.313
<i>You know, you're not Tron.</i>

02:07.218 --> 02:08.384
Never said I was.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.155
<i>Who are you?</i>

02:11.190 --> 02:13.358
Name's Beck.

02:25.288 --> 02:29.826
You really thought you could get
away with what you did back there?

02:36.870 --> 02:38.037
I did get away with it.

02:42.043 --> 02:43.310
Oh, great.

02:43.344 --> 02:46.880
<i>Doesn't look like it to me.</i>

02:49.317 --> 02:50.951
Aah!

04:05.033 --> 04:06.267
Whoa!

04:16.313 --> 04:19.180
<i>You're a long way from home, program.</i>

04:39.003 --> 04:41.138
<i>You're not afraid.</i>

04:42.940 --> 04:44.908
No.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.310
<i>You should be.</i>

04:52.016 --> 04:54.984
<i>So, Beck...</i>

04:55.019 --> 04:57.253
<i>What made you decide
to go renegade?</i>

04:57.287 --> 05:00.989
If you think I'm the renegade,
there's no point in talking.

05:01.024 --> 05:04.859
<i>Then don't talk.
I'll let you show me.</i>

05:04.893 --> 05:06.894
<i>You work here?</i>

05:06.929 --> 05:09.197
Yeah.

05:09.231 --> 05:12.867
But you wanna
know why I did what I did?

05:12.902 --> 05:16.037
<i>It all began there...
Able's garage.</i>

05:16.071 --> 05:18.806
Hey, Beck, you coming?
I want that rematch.

05:18.841 --> 05:23.043
- Hang on, Bodie.
- Here, try it with this.

05:23.078 --> 05:26.247
Didn't realize you were
in such a rush to get beat.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.817
<i>It never felt like work.</i>

05:28.851 --> 05:30.953
<i>But that's probably 'cause
I was doing it with my friends.</i>

05:30.987 --> 05:33.222
- Show-off.
- Just using my natural talents.

05:33.256 --> 05:35.057
Looks like showing off to me.

05:35.092 --> 05:36.926
Or he's afraid of the rematch.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.828
Why would he be?
You've never won.

05:38.862 --> 05:40.062
Yet, Zed, yet.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.101
There. Now we can go.

05:46.970 --> 05:48.270
<i>Now I may be a young program,</i>

05:48.305 --> 05:52.007
<i>but I've been on the Grid long enough
to know that I had it good.</i>

05:52.041 --> 05:55.844
<i>Abel's garage is not just a job,
it's my home.</i>

05:55.878 --> 05:58.913
<i>The only thing
I enjoyed more than the job</i>

05:58.947 --> 06:01.248
<i>were the disc games we'd get into after.</i>

06:04.353 --> 06:07.889
Ha. Not bad, Bodie.
Looks like you've been practicing.

06:07.923 --> 06:09.791
I don't need to practice
for you, Beck.

06:09.825 --> 06:11.860
Looks like you do.

06:18.035 --> 06:21.271
<i>Female voice:
Player two defeated. Game over.</i>

06:21.305 --> 06:23.807
<i>Do you wish to play again?</i>

06:23.841 --> 06:26.043
- Best you can do?
- I'm just warming up, Beck.

06:26.077 --> 06:28.979
That's what I like about
you, Bodie. You don't give up.

06:37.188 --> 06:41.025
<i>Greetings, programs.
This is general Tesler.</i>

06:41.059 --> 06:42.993
- That can't be...
- Good.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.263
<i>In the name of our great leader Clu,</i>

06:46.297 --> 06:50.201
<i>I now claim Argon city
as occupied territory.</i>

07:06.186 --> 07:08.053
Definitely not good.

07:11.224 --> 07:15.960
- If Tron were here...
- You mean if Tron were alive.

07:15.994 --> 07:19.197
- Hey, that's our field.
- This is our field now.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.131
Hey, you can't do...

07:21.165 --> 07:22.833
Bodie!

07:24.202 --> 07:27.205
<i>No more games.</i>

07:27.239 --> 07:29.307
You don't scare us.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.978
Bodie!

07:37.083 --> 07:38.884
He won't get away with that.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.152
<i>Wanna be next?</i>

07:40.187 --> 07:43.923
Beck, don't.
There's nothing we can do.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.159
For now.

07:48.996 --> 07:53.133
<i>You lost a friend.
You were angry.</i>

07:53.168 --> 07:56.137
<i>But it sounds like it was his own fault.</i>

07:56.172 --> 07:57.972
It was Clu's fault.

07:58.007 --> 08:01.176
Before he sent Tesler and you
goons here, everything was fine.

08:01.211 --> 08:06.014
But now, as it hit me that I would
never see Bodie again, it became clear.

08:06.048 --> 08:08.950
I had to do something.

08:14.823 --> 08:17.057
<i>You really thought one program
could make a difference?</i>

08:17.092 --> 08:22.929
Why not?
One program already did... Tron.

08:22.963 --> 08:26.766
I decided to take on his identity.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.904
Tron saved the Grid before,
maybe he could do it again.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.068
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

09:12.980 --> 09:14.180
<i>Is that Tron?</i>

09:14.215 --> 09:16.183
<i>Inform Tesler.</i>

09:18.219 --> 09:22.022
Destroyed? Who did this?

09:22.056 --> 09:24.791
- We don't know. It looked like...
- Who?!

09:24.825 --> 09:28.194
- Tron.
- Tron? Clu.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.166
Tron's dead, Tesler.
I killed him myself.

09:33.200 --> 09:37.104
Paige, see to it personally.
Find him!

09:51.019 --> 09:52.986
<i>Clu's forces didn't deter you.</i>

09:53.021 --> 09:56.090
They tried, but they were amateurs.

09:56.124 --> 09:59.259
I've been riding the streets
of Argon long before they came.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.894
They never had a shot.

10:14.909 --> 10:18.044
That was easy.

10:18.078 --> 10:21.214
<i>Doesn't explain how you
ended up alone in the outlands.</i>

10:25.251 --> 10:27.920
Turns out they weren't all amateurs.

10:38.163 --> 10:42.267
Now that was a mistake.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.740
So you're Tron? Huh.
Thought you'd be taller.

10:59.385 --> 11:00.586
That's it.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.627
What a waste.

11:08.661 --> 11:12.665
They usually don't last this long.
Who are you?

11:12.699 --> 11:15.568
You said it yourself. I'm Tron.

11:31.719 --> 11:33.787
Okay, this is a problem.

11:33.821 --> 11:36.456
- There you are.
- Here I am.

11:42.729 --> 11:46.432
- Game over, program.
- Not yet.

11:57.643 --> 12:00.745
How long are you
gonna keep running?

12:03.749 --> 12:05.817
I'm done. My ride's here.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.558
<i>Female voice: Warning.
Flight control offline.</i>

12:14.361 --> 12:16.630
Thanks, Bodie.

12:16.664 --> 12:20.734
Come on, come on. Nice.

12:20.768 --> 12:23.537
<i>Flight control restored.</i>

12:24.672 --> 12:27.408
You know, this isn't yours.

12:30.745 --> 12:33.379
I can't wait to see
what you've got...

12:33.413 --> 12:37.650
Maybe we should slow things down,
get to know each other better.

12:37.684 --> 12:41.354
Impressive. Maybe you should work
for me. We'd make quite a team.

12:41.388 --> 12:44.523
I don't like your boss.
Maybe you should work for me.

12:44.558 --> 12:46.792
Sorry, don't see
a future in that.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.448
That was fun.
We should do this again.

13:13.387 --> 13:15.522
Hope you know how to land this thing.

13:25.434 --> 13:28.636
Paige, you're empty-handed.
That's unexpected.

13:28.670 --> 13:33.574
- He's good, but he's no Tron.
- You seem uncertain.

13:33.608 --> 13:35.709
You heard Clu. Tron's dead.

13:35.743 --> 13:41.348
And soon,
this renegade will be, too.

14:02.371 --> 14:05.374
<i>You understand this makes you
an enemy of the state.</i>

14:08.578 --> 14:10.446
The state is the enemy.

14:14.584 --> 14:16.618
<i>I see what you're trying to do.</i>

14:20.524 --> 14:25.595
<i>You can dress up like Tron all you want,
but he's still dead.</i>

14:25.629 --> 14:28.331
That's what they tell us.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.606
<i>Why do you want programs
to think he's alive?</i>

14:35.640 --> 14:40.477
Maybe he is, and maybe if other's
think so, too, they'll be braver,

14:40.478 --> 14:45.315
think for themselves some more,
not sit still for Clu's rule.

14:45.349 --> 14:49.753
<i>Do you really think if they believe
Tron's alive it will inspire a revolution?</i>

14:51.522 --> 14:53.390
I know it will.

14:57.494 --> 14:59.528
We won't be intimidated.

14:59.563 --> 15:02.664
I don't care how strong
and powerful your forces are.

15:02.699 --> 15:04.433
<i>You should.</i>

15:07.370 --> 15:09.271
<i>Your actions have consequences.</i>

15:09.306 --> 15:13.742
So does inaction. More slaves,
more friends of mine gone!

15:18.382 --> 15:20.616
And nothing I say will stop you?

15:20.651 --> 15:24.654
I won't stop fighting.

15:36.732 --> 15:39.701
<i>Even if it means you'll be
derezzed right now?</i>

15:39.735 --> 15:45.506
If it means others will
take up my cause... so be it.

15:45.541 --> 15:47.708
Step aside. Let me out.

15:47.743 --> 15:49.544
<i>No.</i>

15:49.579 --> 15:51.580
Then this is the end of both of us.

15:51.614 --> 15:53.615
<i>You won't hurt me.</i>

15:53.650 --> 15:57.420
What makes you so sure?

15:57.454 --> 15:59.822
<i>Because you were right
about one thing.</i>

16:08.332 --> 16:10.433
I'm not dead.

16:10.467 --> 16:15.338
Tron. I was right.
You're here to help.

16:15.372 --> 16:19.575
- No, I'm here because I need help.
- What?

16:19.610 --> 16:24.547
From someone who's committed, and I think
you may be just what I'm looking for.

16:24.581 --> 16:26.649
What are you looking for?

16:30.587 --> 16:32.522
The next Tron.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.544
Tron: There's a war raging.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.748
Most programs don't
even know it's happening.

16:56.782 --> 17:01.420
Clu's generals have taken over
every city on the Grid.

17:02.688 --> 17:07.458
Now, thanks to you,
we can bring the fight to him.

17:07.492 --> 17:11.262
Wait, what do you mean me?
What do I do?

17:11.297 --> 17:14.665
You're special.
I saw what you did tonight.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.501
You have a gift, Beck.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.704
A gift? I'm an okay
mechanic. That's my gift.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.441
See, that thing with
the statue, it was nothing.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.343
It was a one-time deal.

17:25.377 --> 17:29.447
It's a revolution, Beck.
You must finish what's begun.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.385
Why can't you finish it? You were
the one programmed to secure the Grid.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.353
Don't you think I want to?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.723
I can't.

17:37.757 --> 17:42.727
Clu betrayed me, left me with
scars that will never heal.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.730
He took everything from me...

17:45.765 --> 17:48.500
Everything but my name.

17:48.534 --> 17:52.337
I need you to help me
carry on that name,

17:52.371 --> 17:58.343
show everyone that as long as
Tron lives, there is still hope.

17:58.377 --> 18:02.413
I'm sorry, but what I did,
I don't know why I did it.

18:02.448 --> 18:06.617
But I'm not special.
I'm just like everyone else.

18:06.652 --> 18:11.355
- Do you truly believe that?
- Yeah.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.757
Then the war is already lost.

18:30.473 --> 18:32.408
There, movement down below.

18:35.478 --> 18:39.348
Good eye, your excellency.
But whatever it was, it's gone.

18:39.382 --> 18:40.649
Find it.

18:54.799 --> 18:58.334
Weather anomaly. Nothing here.

18:58.369 --> 19:00.337
Continue the sweep.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.349
Ah.

19:12.383 --> 19:14.251
Beck...

19:14.285 --> 19:15.685
- Where have you been?
- Uh...

19:15.719 --> 19:18.454
Get down to the garage.
Something's happening.

19:26.663 --> 19:28.464
<i>This way, program.</i>

19:28.499 --> 19:33.270
Finally.
I've been waiting for you.

19:33.304 --> 19:36.474
Well, now I really feel special.

19:36.508 --> 19:42.414
Don't flatter yourself, program.
This isn't just for you. It's for everyone.

19:42.448 --> 19:48.487
What happened last night
is nothing short of sedition.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.722
If you know this program, turn him in.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.325
<i>Man: It looks like Tron.</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:58.461
As long as he's free...
you won't be.

19:58.496 --> 20:02.431
I'm here to announce that Tesler
is bringing the games to Argon.

20:02.465 --> 20:05.634
In a few cycles, we will be
rounding up volunteers

20:05.668 --> 20:08.637
until this imposter is apprehended.

20:08.672 --> 20:11.640
Now back to work.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.756
- Where'd you get that?
- Uh, I... I found it.

20:25.790 --> 20:29.594
He got it from the cabinet
where we keep all the tools.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.329
Back to it, program.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.299
- Nice to meet you.
- I see the feeling is mutual.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.302
All right, everyone.
The soldiers are gone.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.337
Let's get back to work.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.640
Last night of freedom.

20:41.674 --> 20:46.312
This renegade, Tron, whoever he
is, he's causing a lot of problems.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.648
Maybe he's just trying to help.
Look what they did to Bodie.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.484
And now they're going to do
it to all of us because of him.

20:51.519 --> 20:54.621
- I think he's brave.
- Really?

20:54.655 --> 20:59.358
Seems kinda cowardly, hiding
out his face, letting us suffer.

20:59.393 --> 21:01.394
He's fighting for us.

21:01.429 --> 21:04.465
- And he's kinda handsome.
- Handsome?

21:04.499 --> 21:05.799
How do you know?
He's in a mask.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.787
- I have a feeling.
- Beck, what do you think?

21:08.837 --> 21:10.704
- Is he handsome?
- Is he on our side.

21:10.738 --> 21:12.439
- Wait, Zed.
- Zed, come on.

21:12.473 --> 21:15.308
Beck, may I speak with you?

21:15.342 --> 21:18.444
Go on without me.
I'll catch up with you later.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.748
Did you have anything to do
with that statue being destroyed?

21:23.783 --> 21:27.386
No, I was just out for a walk.

21:27.420 --> 21:31.691
I needed some time alone.
I was upset about Bodie.

21:31.725 --> 21:35.361
I know.
We're all upset about that.

21:35.396 --> 21:37.598
But we can't dwell on what happened,

21:37.632 --> 21:40.701
and you certainly can't
act on those feelings.

21:40.735 --> 21:45.607
With Tesler and his soldiers here,
we all need to be more careful now.

21:45.641 --> 21:48.676
Things have changed.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.444
Don't worry. It won't happen...

21:55.350 --> 21:57.384
<i>Move back.</i>

21:57.418 --> 21:59.652
Attention programs,
I am general Tesler.

21:59.687 --> 22:03.556
I'm here to tell you that
you are now volunteering for the games.

22:03.591 --> 22:05.324
What's going on here?

22:05.359 --> 22:08.327
Thank you for your cooperation.

22:10.431 --> 22:14.602
- I thought they had more time.
- I decided to move up the schedule.

22:14.636 --> 22:18.372
If you had done your job, none
of this would have been necessary.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.444
<i>Woman: Stop! Help us!</i>

22:23.479 --> 22:25.614
Ugh! Beck! Beck!

22:27.650 --> 22:29.684
<i>Attention, programs.</i>

22:29.719 --> 22:32.487
<i>You have been selected for the games.</i>

22:32.521 --> 22:34.389
<i>Please report to the coliseum.</i>

22:34.423 --> 22:36.724
Somebody help us!

22:36.758 --> 22:39.293
- Take it easy.
- Be quiet.

22:40.495 --> 22:43.396
<i>Unauthorized
disembarkment of light rail</i>

22:43.431 --> 22:46.499
<i>will result in immediate
deresolution.</i>

22:46.533 --> 22:50.804
Come back inside.
There's nothing we can do.

23:22.571 --> 23:24.539
<i>What was that?</i>

24:24.433 --> 24:26.334
Uh...

24:50.289 --> 24:54.259
Wait, why would you spare me?

24:54.294 --> 24:55.394
Why?

25:04.537 --> 25:06.304
Wrong car.

25:17.251 --> 25:19.519
<i>Now approaching the coliseum.</i>

26:31.430 --> 26:33.565
<i>For your own safety
and the safety</i>

26:33.599 --> 26:37.602
<i>of your fellow passengers,
please remain seated.</i>

26:37.637 --> 26:41.306
<i>Our attentive staff is currently
working to correct this minor delay.</i>

26:41.341 --> 26:46.512
<i>Remain calm. Transport to the
coliseum will continue shortly.</i>

27:03.594 --> 27:06.363
- I know where they are.
- What?

27:06.397 --> 27:10.200
Your friends, I know where they are.

27:10.235 --> 27:14.339
Front car. Hurry.
The others will be back soon.

27:15.341 --> 27:19.210
Programs, leave now!

27:19.245 --> 27:21.246
Quickly!

27:22.648 --> 27:25.451
- It's him!
- Come on!

27:32.625 --> 27:34.460
Move! Move! Move!

27:34.494 --> 27:36.328
Come on, keep it moving!

27:36.362 --> 27:39.331
Maybe we should go say hi.
You know, thank him.

27:39.365 --> 27:41.533
Or maybe we should live. Go!

27:43.636 --> 27:45.403
Thank you for that.

27:45.437 --> 27:48.440
It was the least I could do.
Thank you.

28:05.358 --> 28:09.595
I don't like the effect
you're having on my people.

28:27.445 --> 28:30.515
Who do you think you are? Tron?

28:30.549 --> 28:34.486
Forgive me if I don't
shake your hand.

28:47.435 --> 28:51.304
You're no Tron. You're nothing!

29:15.628 --> 29:17.562
You think you're helping them,

29:17.597 --> 29:21.366
But trust me, you're only
making things more painful.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.468
Those programs
I just rescued might disagree.

29:24.503 --> 29:26.671
Look out there.

29:26.705 --> 29:31.275
I've got dozens of cars heading
to round up more programs.

29:31.310 --> 29:32.644
You can't save 'em all!

29:36.349 --> 29:37.516
Watch me.

29:51.731 --> 29:53.632
This isn't over.

30:11.506 --> 30:13.841
Told you he wasn't that
easy to catch.

30:13.929 --> 30:18.814
Wipe that smirk
off your face and find him.

30:26.805 --> 30:30.949
I wanted do this.
I have to do this.

30:31.066 --> 30:35.748
- I'm ready.
- No, you're not.

30:40.294 --> 30:42.645
But you will be.

30:53.565 --> 30:57.469
Come...
we have a lot of work to do...

30:57.556 --> 31:00.300
Tron.
