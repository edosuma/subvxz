Peggy:

<i>I hope this letter
finds you well.</i>

04:30.304 --> 04:33.872

to celebrate Becky Redman's birthday.</i>

04:33.874 --> 04:36.575
We drank to your health
and to our dear Becky Franks

04:36.577 --> 04:38.043
with whom we hope
you will share this letter."

04:38.045 --> 04:40.312
How will he know how to parse
through all this nonsense?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.648
Because I name you a man
of exceptional character.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.916
Name me?
In the letter?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.052
How else will he know
with whom he's dealing?

04:47.054 --> 04:49.888
I don't know.
Some... some manner of code.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.490
Something which
doesn't expose me.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.325
This is the code, darling.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.027
<i>The words exceptional
and character</i>

04:55.029 --> 04:59.064
will signal to André that this is
more than nonsense, as you say.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.068
How much of this have you
discussed with him beforehand?

05:05.306 --> 05:07.673
Just this.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.114
He said after the initial overture,
instructions would follow.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.313
Read it.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.016
"As for Philadelphia,
we are quite well.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.653
The Continental officers here
acquit themselves with great honor.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.824
One among them is a man
of exceptional character.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.795
His name is General
Benedict Arnold.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.963
<i>And as I think you may
have heard from Becky,</i>

05:31.965 --> 05:35.534
he and I are engaged
to be married.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.370
What you may not have heard

05:38.372 --> 05:40.972
is that my older sister Betsy
is now also engaged

05:40.974 --> 05:43.909
and will be married
this November,

05:43.911 --> 05:47.846
which has allowed General Arnold and
I to set a date for our own wedding.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.617
We will be married
the first of March.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.825
Your fond correspondent,
Peggy Shippen."

05:59.827 --> 06:01.693
March.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.804
Sir, Philadelphia?

06:12.806 --> 06:16.675
Yes, a date has been set
for her wedding.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.878
March.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.950
I can't write her directly
about my feelings,

06:24.952 --> 06:29.788
so I need you to convey
my words personally.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.924
Please.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.993
Tell her that she never
leaves my thoughts

06:34.995 --> 06:37.829
and that I cling to the hope
that someday soon

06:37.831 --> 06:40.132
we shall be reunited.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.401
She'll understand my meaning.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.670
If that's what
you want me to do, sir.

06:49.943 --> 06:53.011
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

06:53.013 --> 06:55.447
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

07:04.858 --> 07:07.759
- Hewlett: <i> Yes?</i>
- Edmund, it's me.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.063
Madame.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.832
( chuckles )
Edmund.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.701
Oh, to hell with propriety.
I'm too happy.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.670
And I know that
you would be married

07:18.672 --> 07:20.672
in a church rather than
here at Whitehall,

07:20.674 --> 07:24.176
but I thought to avoid speculation
because of the gossip.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.844
No, no, you're right.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.145
This is about us, not them.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.948
Yes, yes, I know.
I just...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.117
Edmund, after the wedding,

07:32.119 --> 07:34.152
I was wondering if we
could go to New York.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.087
To New York?
Why?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.790
Just thought it might be
nice to be away from here,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.927
from them,
for even a little while.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.196
Perhaps we can go
to York City at some point,

07:44.198 --> 07:47.199
but for now we must see how
our other plan has fared.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.701
<i>- ( door opens )</i>
- Thomas: <i> Mama!</i>

07:49.703 --> 07:52.804
- Mary: <i> Thomas!</i>
- And perhaps news of that has just arrived.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.172
Mary: <i>There you are.</i>
Let me look at you.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.007
( sighs )

07:56.009 --> 07:59.511
- Been helping build the house, huh?
- Mama missed you.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.012
- Abe: <i>You missed Mama?</i>
- Mary: <i> I've missed you.</i>

08:01.014 --> 08:03.882
- Abe: Yeah, he missed Mama.
- Abraham.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.851
Mary: Come on, I'll get
you something to eat.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.752
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:13.692
- Well? Any word?
- No, no.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.128
- I had hoped that you'd come bearing glad tidings
- No.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.031
Still, I suppose it's fortunate
that we had this chance to talk.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.867
There's another matter
which we need to discuss.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.702
If you mean your wedding,
I've heard the news.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.170
But since it seems
we'll both soon be gone,

08:25.172 --> 08:26.271
I don't see what's
left to discuss.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.240
We are not going to Scotland.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.376
You're not?

08:31.377 --> 08:32.809
Now that Anna
has obtained a divorce,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.279
we're going to stay right here.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.847
However, the only condition
Selah Strong gives

08:36.850 --> 08:40.051
is that she admits
to adultery with you.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.524
Wait, Selah requested this?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.025
He did.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.760
And as a gentleman,
I thought it only fitting

08:48.762 --> 08:50.295
that you should hear it
before it becomes public.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.998
Oh, well,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.133
thank you very much
for your concern.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.092
( groans )

09:21.094 --> 09:22.994
I wouldn't try that.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.963
Unless you want to go back
to bleeding to death.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.836
I already took out the bullet,
sewed you up as best I could.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.705
Thank you.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.006
Where is your husband?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.842
<i>Out selling our crop.</i>

09:39.146 --> 09:42.013
You want to thank me,
tell me who you are

09:42.015 --> 09:44.182
and how that bullet got
in you in the first place.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.787
As you may have heard,
there's a war on.

09:48.789 --> 09:52.157
Got skinners and cowboys as well as
soldiers on both sides, so which are you?

09:58.231 --> 10:00.265
I...

10:00.267 --> 10:04.035
my name is Benjamin.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.606
Benjamin Brewster.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.942
And I'm not on any side.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.279
Then how'd you end up here
bleeding in the night?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.915
Where is here?

10:18.051 --> 10:20.118
You don't know where you are?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.854
I got hit on the head
pretty hard.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.190
Well, you remember that
and you remember your name,

10:25.192 --> 10:27.826
so maybe you can
remember the rest

10:27.828 --> 10:29.094
with some encouraging.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.096
I...

10:31.098 --> 10:34.299
I'm a traveling minister.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.936
I... I go wherever
the Lord calls me

10:37.938 --> 10:39.070
to do His work.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.939
( gunshot )

10:45.979 --> 10:50.982
I... I met trouble on the
road in New Jersey.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.851
- Gamble's voice: <i>No need to move.</i>
- Brigands.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.919
You're fine there.

10:54.921 --> 10:58.223
Ben: <i>Though which side</i>
they're on, I can't say.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.860
The last thing I remember
is a shot.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.294
( gunshot )

11:03.296 --> 11:06.931
And then my horse bolting.

11:06.933 --> 11:11.002
I've no idea how far he
carried me before I fell off

11:11.004 --> 11:15.206
<i>or how far I walked
before I saw your light.</i>

11:15.208 --> 11:19.244
I reckon the Lord was guiding
me to another savior.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.347
<i>I owe you my life.</i>

11:27.954 --> 11:30.055
This fell out of your pocket.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.059
I'd imagine you'd like
it back, Reverend.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.467
You're in Franklin Township.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.036
New Jersey?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.038
My name's Sarah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.306
Sarah Livingston.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.209
I'm very pleased
to meet you, Sarah.

11:54.448 --> 11:57.916
Our quarry's name
is Benjamin Tallmadge.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.418
He's wounded and he's alone.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.421
Now, I hear you boys
are good at hunting.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.490
If you two can help me
recapture him,

12:05.492 --> 12:08.293
I can guarantee there'll be
some coin in it for you.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.764
- Yeah, for king and country.
- Yeah, sounds good to me.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.500
With the rain, he would
have sought shelter.

12:15.502 --> 12:19.070
Way it is around here, he can't
risk knocking on many doors

12:19.072 --> 12:21.206
not knowing if it's
friend or foe behind them.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.376
( sighs ) Then I suppose we'll
knock on every door ourselves

12:25.378 --> 12:27.145
till we find him.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.453
<i>- ( knock on door )</i>
- Richard: <i> Who is it?</i>

12:35.455 --> 12:37.822
Abe:
<i>Your grandson.</i>

12:48.969 --> 12:51.536
To what do I owe this pleasure?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.004
He asked to see you.

12:53.006 --> 12:56.808
And you indulged him.
How kind.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.410
Go on, one hug. Then we've
got to go, all right?

13:01.515 --> 13:04.549
So you thought you'd stop by
and torture your father, huh?

13:04.551 --> 13:07.385
- Twist the knife?
- As far as I'm concerned, I don't have a father.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.187
Then why are you here?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.825
To discuss a matter that might
interest the magistrate.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.535
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

13:27.374 --> 13:29.440
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

13:31.578 --> 13:34.012
Mm, that smells good.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.514
Thought it would be a shame
if you survived your wounds

13:36.516 --> 13:39.250
only to die of starvation.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.252
( groans )

13:45.158 --> 13:46.457
Whose clothes are these?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.127
Your old ones
are sodden with blood.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.330
You sure your husband
won't mind?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.531
Not at all.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.112
Here.
Here, let me help you.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.291
All right.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.126
Here, drink.

14:41.514 --> 14:45.183
Bless, O Lord,
this food to our use

14:45.185 --> 14:47.118
and us to thy service

14:47.120 --> 14:50.255
and keep us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.557
In Jesus' name.
Amen.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.392
Amen.

15:09.376 --> 15:13.077
Do you mind my asking
you a question?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.146
Go ahead.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.549
Well, when you, um... when
you changed my clothes,

15:18.551 --> 15:21.552
I... I'm guessing
that you had to...

15:21.554 --> 15:25.223
I raised two brothers
not to mention a husband.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.925
You raised your husband?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.960
All men need some raising.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.462
Else they'll stay boys forever.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.440
<i>( utensils clatter )</i>

15:44.144 --> 15:45.443
Sarah, what's wrong?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.946
Nothing.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.580
Nothing.
It's just...

15:52.485 --> 15:55.954
I haven't been
telling you the truth.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.622
My husband,

15:57.624 --> 16:02.093
the night I found you
was the same night he died

16:02.095 --> 16:03.394
a year ago.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.232
That's why I laid out
the second plate.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.568
I...

16:10.570 --> 16:13.271
I wanted to feel his presence.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.650
- Do you mind my ask...
- Shot by thieves.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.052
Just like you were.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.688
<i>He lived a few hours,</i>

16:30.690 --> 16:34.392
but a doctor was too far away.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.563
He died in my arms.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.769
So when you found me on
that night of all nights,

16:44.771 --> 16:47.405
I thought...

16:47.407 --> 16:51.676
well, I thought that maybe you
were guided here for a reason.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.412
That if I could save you,
then it would...

17:06.226 --> 17:08.626
<i>( distant dog barking )</i>

17:13.800 --> 17:15.700
Peggy's voice:
<i>And who is this?</i>

17:15.702 --> 17:18.569
Major John André
at your service, ladies.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.271
What service are you
offering, Major?

17:21.273 --> 17:23.340
Why, a dance, of course.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.750
Peggy's voice: <i>Don't presume
you know</i> what it is to be me.

17:41.594 --> 17:44.362
Peggy's voice: <i>I thought we
were going</i> to be together.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.597
I need you to remain here

17:46.599 --> 17:48.699
to befriend Arnold

17:48.701 --> 17:50.835
and make an introduction to me.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.446
( chatter )

18:18.631 --> 18:20.565
Philomena:
Good evening, gentlemen.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.839
Is this seat taken?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.745
I saw the playbill
for your new production.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.747
I'm pleased your theatrical
career has blossomed.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.350
I've missed you, John.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.787
When I heard you'd be returning to New
York, I couldn't wait to see you.

18:42.789 --> 18:47.825
But it seems a different man
has returned in your place.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.428
Did something happen
in Philadelphia?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.865
Oh, just a war.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.701
And an unfortunate exodus.

18:56.703 --> 19:00.138
Not something, someone.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.607
( exhales )
Imagine that.

19:02.609 --> 19:07.411
A woman stealing Major John
André's well-guarded heart.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.452
There is a cure

19:14.454 --> 19:16.821
for that sort of
melancholy, you know.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.233
Excuse me.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.744
Something stronger, I think.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.646
Feel free to join me.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.781
I think I will
stick to my coffee.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.617
I wish I had your forbearance.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.853
I have a weakness or two.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.924
I hope none of them are women.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.705
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

20:15.448 --> 20:17.481
Ah, look who's here.

20:19.953 --> 20:21.870
Have you come for a cup of sugar

20:21.871 --> 20:23.788
or do you need me
to give away the bride?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.623
May I come in?

20:27.627 --> 20:28.893
Just don't wake him.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.494
Had a hard enough day as it is.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.768
I was planning on telling you.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.637
When?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.505
- After the wedding?
- I couldn't get away.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.508
Even now I'm supposed to be asking
if you've heard word on the ambush.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.978
And instead of that,
you're doing what?

20:48.514 --> 20:50.948
- Making a final appeal.
- For Hewlett?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.617
You've already done that twice.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.919
I can control him, Abe,
as his wife.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.621
Steer him away from you.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.789
You can steer him?

20:58.791 --> 21:00.458
Like a horse?

21:00.460 --> 21:04.262
No, you know what I mean.
He loves me.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.697
And his experience
with women is limited.

21:06.699 --> 21:11.469
Well, your charms are considerable,
I'll grant you that.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.605
But I doubt it can turn
his coat from red to blue

21:14.607 --> 21:17.642
no matter how hard
you work at it.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.645
There's no need to be so coarse.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.481
- And I'm not just doing this for him.
- No?

21:23.483 --> 21:26.817
If you murder that man, you'll be
killing a part of yourself as well.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.020
Please, this isn't
about my soul.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.888
And it's not about the ring,
either, so don't hide behind that.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.790
All right,
then what is it about?

21:34.527 --> 21:35.826
- It's jealousy.
- ( scoffs )

21:35.828 --> 21:37.795
Pure and simple.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.997
You just can't stand the
thought of me marrying him.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.668
No, no, I can't stand the thought of you
marrying someone that you don't love

21:43.670 --> 21:45.002
because you think
it's the right thing to do.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.737
Like you did?

21:49.609 --> 21:53.010
Look, now I am doing
this for you.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.647
Anna, I can't watch you sacrifice
your future just to save the enemy.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.082
He's not the enemy.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.985
He may be on the other side,
but he was born to that.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.021
It doesn't matter 'cause
you're not marrying him!

22:04.023 --> 22:05.523
It's not your decision to make.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.025
But I have.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.061
But you... what are
you talking about?

22:11.764 --> 22:14.031
I shared my suspicions
with my father

22:14.033 --> 22:16.033
that your divorce will not
stand up to scrutiny.

22:16.035 --> 22:20.771
Now, he's a cowardly shit,
but he's a good judge.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.907
He can spot a forgery
from a mile away.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.645
Call off the wedding now

22:27.647 --> 22:29.447
before you're accused
of a crime.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.717
You've already done this?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.085
It's for your own good.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.656
And, yes, it's for
the good of the ring.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.792
No, it's to deny me
even a chance at happiness.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.627
Admit it.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.999
If you have a shred
of honesty left in you,

22:49.001 --> 22:50.401
admit it.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.041
( sighs )

23:19.832 --> 23:22.733
<i>( Ben whimpers )</i>

23:22.735 --> 23:25.503
( whimpering )

23:40.052 --> 23:43.120
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

25:03.102 --> 25:05.769
<i>( Philomena sighs )</i>

25:05.771 --> 25:08.072
As I said before, John.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.041
I have missed you.
( chuckles )

25:24.991 --> 25:26.824
<i>Melancholy already?</i>

25:29.295 --> 25:32.263
I hate to think my cure
no longer works.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.976
What is it?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.880
I was wondering,

25:49.882 --> 25:52.983
if it doesn't interfere
with your stage work,

25:52.985 --> 25:54.952
if you wouldn't
do something for me.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.291
Will this involve screwing
another rebel general?

26:03.095 --> 26:04.929
No.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.668
Can you style
your hair like this?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.642
Exactly like this?

26:20.613 --> 26:23.013
Not for some general.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.350
For me.

26:28.321 --> 26:31.088
A high roll.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.923
Looks expensive.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.194
Don't you worry.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.929
I'll pay.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.310
<i>( door closes )</i>

26:56.983 --> 26:58.649
He wishes to see you
immediately.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.255
Arnold: <i>Troop deployments
and movements.</i>

27:05.257 --> 27:08.659
Locations of gunpowder.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.395
Location of Washington's camp.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.164
These are requests
for intelligence.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.166
I'm offering to lead the
royal forces to victory

27:16.168 --> 27:18.002
and he treats me
like a common spy.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.671
He must know of your
reputation on the battlefield.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.172
Surely he wouldn't
seek to insult you.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.642
- Monk.
- Beg your pardon?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.877
The code name that he's chosen for me.
The insult couldn't be plainer.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.346
Monk?
How is that an insult?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.349
George Monk was a general
under Cromwell

27:32.351 --> 27:34.952
who turned against Parliament in
order to restore the monarchy.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.854
I'm not betraying Congress.

27:36.856 --> 27:40.057
I'm offering to lead an army
against theirs in open battle.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.092
Benedict.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.428
How did you know exactly
where to find his reply?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.397
Concealed in the binding.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.265
I went over the book twice
before you arrived,

27:48.267 --> 27:50.134
<i>but you were able
to find it right away.</i>

27:50.136 --> 27:52.002
He told me.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.338
André did before he left.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.440
<i>At the time, it seemed
a silly business,</i>

27:56.442 --> 27:59.043
but now I'm glad he
insisted on explaining it.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.444
Really? Why?

28:00.446 --> 28:05.315
Because his methods will be
protecting the man I love.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.723
You're a brave man, Benedict.

28:15.127 --> 28:18.729
Why don't you admit what's
really bothering you?

28:20.166 --> 28:23.233
You are worried about
betraying your country.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.469
I only told you about André
because it seemed clear

28:25.471 --> 28:28.105
that your country
has betrayed you.

28:28.107 --> 28:31.041
- It's not that simple.
- It seems so to me.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.409
Why do you owe them
your loyalty?

28:32.411 --> 28:34.912
It's what I owe myself.

28:34.914 --> 28:38.082
My honor is the one thing that I've
carried through this war intact

28:38.084 --> 28:40.751
- and I intend to preserve it.
- Then tell that to André.

28:42.455 --> 28:46.123
Tell him who you are.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.759
And what you wish to be called.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.733
Gustavus.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.107
Gustavus Vasa,

29:03.109 --> 29:05.275
the general who led Sweden
to independence from Denmark

29:05.277 --> 29:08.345
and at great personal risk
to himself.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.347
And I have
some demands of my own

29:10.349 --> 29:12.282
including proper compensation.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.785
- I'm not some bloody volunteer.
- Of course not.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.491
Still, rather than simply countering
their demands with your own,

29:20.493 --> 29:25.262
perhaps it might be wiser
to sweeten the pie.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.430
Sweeten the pie?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.266
If only as a token
of your good faith.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.473
Look, I suppose I could tell him
about this currency business.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.342
What currency business?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.310
Washington told me that
the Continental dollar

29:40.312 --> 29:43.413
has become so devalued
that he...

29:43.415 --> 29:46.049
he worries about being able
to pay for another campaign.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.319
Perfect.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.390
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

30:14.346 --> 30:16.480
It's freezing in here.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.248
I'll tend to the hearth.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.091
Are you well enough to travel?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.196
Yes, I suppose so.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.598
Then I'll make some breakfast.
You can be on your way.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.569
Sarah...

30:46.412 --> 30:48.412
Sarah, what's wrong?

30:51.584 --> 30:53.217
Sarah, listen.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.620
What... what happened
last night...

30:56.622 --> 31:00.090
Last night happened
because I was lonely.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.558
Because a year ago
my husband died

31:01.560 --> 31:02.893
and I wanted a man in my bed.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.429
No, this was not just you.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.497
Sarah, I wanted it as well.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.869
What about your mission?

31:11.871 --> 31:13.503
Your vow to keep
the Lord's path?

31:18.077 --> 31:20.143
What if...

31:20.145 --> 31:22.346
what if I told you

31:22.348 --> 31:25.148
that wasn't my mission?

31:25.150 --> 31:26.450
What are you saying?

31:31.323 --> 31:33.423
I'm not a minister.

31:33.425 --> 31:37.561
- My father was.
- You lied to me.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.413
Why?

31:39.414 --> 31:41.264
I just... I wasn't sure
that I could trust you.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.500
Just as you weren't sure
that you could trust me.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.269
Who are you?

31:45.271 --> 31:47.671
Sarah.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.440
Who are you?

31:50.442 --> 31:53.176
My...

31:53.178 --> 31:56.446
my name is Benjamin, all right?

31:56.448 --> 32:00.083
Benjamin Tallmadge.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.687
And I'm an officer
in the Continental Army.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.956
- You're a rebel.
- Aye.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.293
I was out on a scouting
mission when I was captured.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.428
I escaped, but the man
that I escaped from

32:11.430 --> 32:14.564
is no doubt hunting me
right now, maybe with others.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.199
And you come to my house?

32:16.201 --> 32:19.369
Listen to me. I won't let
anything happen to you.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.505
I want you to come with me.
I can protect you.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.141
I don't need your protection!

32:24.143 --> 32:26.310
I need protection from you.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.679
And from men like you.

32:28.681 --> 32:31.348
Damn rebels,
haven't you taken enough?

32:32.985 --> 32:35.652
- You're a Tory.
- And you're a traitor.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.621
A traitor?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.656
( scoffs )
A traitor to whom?

32:39.658 --> 32:42.659
I am loyal to my country.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.728
To our country.
To America.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.230
Your country killed my husband.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.400
Your husband?

32:50.402 --> 32:53.170
No. No, you said
thieves killed him.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.306
Thieves, soldiers, Continental
militia, they're all the same.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.676
They came here last winter demanding
he sell our crops at a loss.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.979
He refused, so they shot him.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.581
No, those weren't Patriots, Sarah.
Those were brigands.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.249
They were acting under orders.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.051
- Orders? Whose orders?
- General Washington's.

33:08.053 --> 33:10.387
That's impossible.
Last winter...

33:11.690 --> 33:13.390
You what?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.528
Last winter we were in a
forage war with the British.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.732
The men were starving and
Washington issued orders...

33:23.035 --> 33:24.735
to obtain supplies...

33:26.438 --> 33:28.038
at all costs.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.275
No, Sarah. Sarah.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.349
So what will you do with me?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.685
What you already did, only
now at the point of a gun?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.521
- Sarah...
-<i> ( hoofbeats,</i> horse neighing )

33:47.226 --> 33:50.394
Seems the Lord's judgment has
caught up with you, Reverend.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.699
- ( hammer clicks )
- Where's your spare powder?

33:55.701 --> 33:57.567
- Barn.
- <i>( knocking )</i>

33:57.569 --> 33:59.536
Guess you'll have to make do.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.041
- Who is it?
- <i>Lieutenant Gamble, ma'am.</i>

34:04.043 --> 34:06.043
<i>Of the Royal Army.</i>

34:08.580 --> 34:11.248
May we come in, ma'am?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.116
You're not in uniform,
Lieutenant.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.788
I'm searching for a rebel spy.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.793
<i>A man like that, you don't
want him to see you coming.</i>

34:25.764 --> 34:28.598
He's already killed a loyal
minister in cold blood.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.702
- <i>( door closes )</i>
- A minister?

34:32.704 --> 34:36.639
Have you seen or heard of
any strangers hereabouts?

34:36.641 --> 34:39.376
Possibly one
with a gunshot injury.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.283
I'm afraid not, Lieutenant.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.553
Though if you find this man,
I hope you make him suffer

34:49.554 --> 34:52.656
for his crimes and for the rebel
filth that killed my husband.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.659
She's telling the truth, sir.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.664
They killed her husband, William,
all right. Stole his crop.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.699
A year ago, weren't it, Sarah?

35:03.869 --> 35:05.869
My condolences.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.107
I'd keep your door latched

35:10.109 --> 35:12.642
and a musket handy
if you've got one.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.544
Thank you, Lieutenant.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.429
<i>( horses whinny,
hoofbeats departing )</i>

35:32.431 --> 35:34.898
I never want to see
your face again.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.638

37:35.254 --> 37:37.854
<i>or forever hold his peace.</i>

37:39.291 --> 37:40.957
I object.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.959
- <i>( crowd murmuring )</i>
- What?

37:42.961 --> 37:45.462
As a friend I've tried
to hold my tongue,

37:45.464 --> 37:48.932
but as a magistrate I can no longer
allow this marriage to proceed.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.635
No, no, Richard, you've
gone too far this time.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.803
Captain, take this man and put
him in the bloody stockades.

37:53.805 --> 37:57.674
Hear me out and you may wish to
put your bride there instead.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.879
The divorce papers she
submitted from Connecticut

38:02.881 --> 38:05.282
are false.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.784
She forged the signatures

38:07.786 --> 38:10.620
and I have taxation records

38:10.622 --> 38:13.056
<i>from Selah Strong to prove it.</i>

38:13.058 --> 38:15.792
Please, you are welcome
to examine them.

38:17.496 --> 38:22.966
So, if we let this
marriage proceed now,

38:22.968 --> 38:25.669
the only result will be the sin

38:25.671 --> 38:28.038
and the crime of bigamy.

38:29.074 --> 38:32.575
<i>Do you deny it,
Mrs. Strong?</i>

38:38.050 --> 38:39.749
It is a forgery.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.052
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

38:47.693 --> 38:50.093
And he made me do it.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.594
What?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.001
I have no home, no husband,

38:58.003 --> 39:01.871
and he promised
to take care of me.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.774
He convinced me to lie

39:04.776 --> 39:07.377
and said no one would notice.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.747
Is that a fact?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.751
Major Hewlett, is this true?

39:29.067 --> 39:32.035
- Yes.
- ( crowd gasps )

39:42.581 --> 39:44.414
Forgive me.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.404
Shakespeare's sonnets.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.838
He used to read them to me.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.143
Let him know that when
he holds this book,

40:13.145 --> 40:15.145
he'll be holding my heart.

40:22.421 --> 40:26.189
Does John still love me?

40:28.627 --> 40:31.728
I can't remember all
his fine words, ma'am,

40:31.730 --> 40:35.799
but you're all he thinks about.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.804
Thank you, Abigail.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.177
I'm so glad I found you.

40:47.179 --> 40:51.748
All my theater friends say you are
an expert in the Philadelphia style.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.783
I did all the society ladies

40:53.785 --> 40:56.219
before I was expelled
from that Eden

40:56.221 --> 40:59.689
without so much as a fig
leaf to cover my shame.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.959
( laughs )
Ah, here it is.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.994
Can you style me
exactly like this?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.497
And send the bill to
Major John André, Mr...

41:07.499 --> 41:09.866
All my friends call me Freddy.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.507
And, yes.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.843
I can do that style from memory.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.180
Your new orders.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.217
Details of your duties as
commander of the garrison.

41:27.219 --> 41:28.852
Commander?

41:28.854 --> 41:31.254
New York may assign a new man,

41:31.256 --> 41:35.191
but since you have already held
the post when I was a prisoner,

41:35.193 --> 41:38.161
I would imagine
they'll let you keep it.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.865
It's not exactly
a coveted position.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.032
But, sir...

41:43.034 --> 41:45.034
I have written
to General Clinton

41:45.036 --> 41:47.504
informing him of my resignation

41:47.506 --> 41:50.874
and my request to be
discharged back to England.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.080
I am done with
the colonies, Wakefield.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.885
I do not understand them

42:01.887 --> 42:04.521
and perhaps never will.

42:04.523 --> 42:08.791
But I do know that I have
nothing left to stay for.

42:13.298 --> 42:18.568
I had hoped to embrace
this new world,

42:18.570 --> 42:22.205
but it seems the romance,

42:22.207 --> 42:26.843
as always,
was one-sided.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.051
Anna's voice:
<i>"Dear Abraham,</i>

42:35.053 --> 42:39.055

<i>a clear path to continue

42:44.829 --> 42:48.898

42:48.900 --> 42:52.101

42:52.103 --> 42:55.138

42:59.344 --> 43:02.278

43:02.280 --> 43:05.782
<i>I can at least tell myself

43:09.621 --> 43:13.156

43:16.795 --> 43:19.128
<i>You drove me
to befriend him, Abraham.</i>

43:19.130 --> 43:22.265
<i>And when I did,
you made me pay for it.</i>

43:22.267 --> 43:25.234
<i>And for that, I'm not sure
I can ever forgive you.</i>

still a hope</i>

43:54.065 --> 43:57.900
<i>that this war that has already
cost us so much...</i>

44:00.405 --> 44:03.206

cost us everything."</i>
