To bring in revenue, <i>
shore up our finances? Yes.</i>

00:06.484 --> 00:08.791
What I don't need is somebody
going behind my back.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.706
I've been in front of you
the whole time.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.099
<i>You just refuse to see me.</i>

00:12.142 --> 00:15.015
- You okay?
- After Benny left,

00:15.058 --> 00:17.452
I thought he would offer me
this office.

00:17.495 --> 00:18.975
One of the firms circled back

00:19.019 --> 00:21.978
and asked me if I would
work for them in-house.

00:22.022 --> 00:22.805
And what did you say?

00:22.848 --> 00:25.155
I am considering a Plan B.

Gun!

01:12.855 --> 01:14.509
Don't go out there!

01:14.552 --> 01:15.814
NYPD.
Police officers.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.773
NYPD. Stay back.

01:17.816 --> 01:21.168
Stay back.
Go back inside.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.647
84 Adam to Central.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.388
Ten-85.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.521
Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.697
Suspect is down.
Need a bus ASAP.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.916
Copy that.
- You see the money?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.179
Nothing.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.310
Well, it's-it's got to be here.
Check again.

01:44.669 --> 01:45.757
Where's the money?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.934
Did we get the wrong guy?

01:51.720 --> 01:54.375
His name's Corey Rice.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.595
Had a job as
a security guard,

01:57.639 --> 02:00.163
and he was on his way to work
when the cops came after him.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.686
They were looking
for a guy

02:01.730 --> 02:03.384
who was robbing
check cashing stores.

02:03.427 --> 02:04.733
How'd they end up
targeting him?

02:04.776 --> 02:08.345
The NYPD uses a facial
recognition software

02:08.389 --> 02:11.043
made by a company called
Viridipoint AI.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.133
They ID'd Corey
as the robber

02:13.176 --> 02:14.569
from some security
camera footage,

02:14.612 --> 02:16.179
and the cops went
to arrest him.
Okay.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.050
He didn't have anything
to do with the robbery?

02:18.094 --> 02:20.183
They found that out
after he was dead.
Yeah.

02:20.227 --> 02:23.186
The city settled with his
mother for $2.5 million.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.796
Wow.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.886
That's gonna be inadequate
next to the loss of her son.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.149
Yeah.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.715
If she's settled,
what does she want with us?

02:30.759 --> 02:33.327
Corey was my rock.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.983
Cancer took his father.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.684
I've seen firsthand
what can happen to a boy

02:42.727 --> 02:45.556
when his father
is taken from him.

02:47.515 --> 02:47.558
My Corey decided
just to grow up, then and there.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.087
13 years old,
acting like it was his job

02:55.131 --> 02:56.959
to take care of me.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.483
Sounds like he was
a fine young man.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.921
He was studying criminal justice
at John Jay.

03:03.922 --> 03:07.056
He wanted to be one of them,

03:07.099 --> 03:09.537
and they shot him.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.452
They shot my baby.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.714
Mrs. Rice,

03:12.757 --> 03:15.064
obviously, what
happened to your son

03:15.107 --> 03:16.631
was a tragedy.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.374
But since you accepted
a settlement from the NYPD,

03:20.417 --> 03:22.071
what is it you'd like
for us to do?

03:22.114 --> 03:24.595
That settlement's blood money
as far as I'm concerned.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.511
I'll never touch a penny of it
for myself.

03:27.555 --> 03:31.907
I'm going to use it
to make sure no other mothers

03:31.950 --> 03:32.864
lose their babies

03:32.908 --> 03:36.085
because they were
misidentified.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.305
Let me show you something.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.964
This is the mugshot

03:46.008 --> 03:48.358
of the man
who was ultimately arrested

03:48.402 --> 03:50.012
for robbing those stores.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.970
Doesn't look anything
like Corey.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.755
Their complexions are different.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.453
He's, like, ten years
and 20 pounds off.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.977
And this is the photo

03:59.021 --> 04:00.805
from the security camera

04:00.849 --> 04:02.590
from the robbery.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.288
Somehow, when this image
was uploaded into Viridipoint's

04:05.332 --> 04:06.768
facial recognitionprogram,

04:06.811 --> 04:10.119
it gave the police
my son's name.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.599
Viridipoint sent

04:11.642 --> 04:14.166
armed men to hunt my child
like an animal.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.518
So, you want to sue Viridipoint
for wrongful death?

04:17.561 --> 04:20.608
They put a target
on my son's back.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.523
I want them held accountable.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.265
Mrs. Rice, I hear you,
but we'd be asking

04:25.308 --> 04:27.005
a jury to assign blame
to someone

04:27.049 --> 04:29.443
after another party effectively

04:29.486 --> 04:31.923
accepted responsibility
by paying you

04:31.967 --> 04:33.011
a financial settlement.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.274
I know it'll be a fight.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.625
I'm afraid
it's more than that.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.366
If we win,

04:39.409 --> 04:43.587
then the settlement's
just gonna be about money--

04:43.631 --> 04:45.415
blood money, as you put it.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.504
If I hit them where they live,

04:47.548 --> 04:49.201
cost them enough,

04:49.245 --> 04:50.899
maybe they'll think twice

04:50.942 --> 04:53.554
before they let the cops
use their software.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.253
They'll change their ways

04:57.297 --> 04:59.081
before another
innocent man is killed.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.913
Corey's death
has got to mean something.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.089
It's got to.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.702
You don't like this case, <i>
do you?</i>

05:11.746 --> 05:14.226
Well, we got to convince a jury
that a bunch of coders

05:14.270 --> 05:16.838
are liable for a killing
they didn't take part in,

05:16.881 --> 05:18.535
witness,
or even know about.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.145
I know it's gonna be
a difficult case,

05:20.189 --> 05:21.799
but don't you think that
this company bears

05:21.843 --> 05:23.061
some responsibility?

05:23.105 --> 05:24.541
I don't care if
it's difficult.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.717
I care about getting this
mother what she needs.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.240
- What's that mean?
- She's in pain.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.851
She wants to avenge
her son's death.

05:29.894 --> 05:33.289
Civil litigation is not gonna
get her what she wants.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.030
It's the only way
I know to help her.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.598
I understand that,
but $700 an hour attorney

05:37.641 --> 05:40.731
hammering out another settlement
for her, that's just...

05:40.775 --> 05:41.776
not gonna bring her joy.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.082
Wait a second.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.649
What's going on there?

05:45.693 --> 05:48.783
Is that Marissa having
a sit-down with Bradley Lena?

05:48.826 --> 05:49.871
Looks like it.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.263
He just won that big

05:51.307 --> 05:53.135
gender discriminationlawsuit.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.224
Did she tell you
she was meeting with him?

05:55.267 --> 05:57.139
Well, she said she
was meeting someone.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.706
She didn't say it was him.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.490
That was a very
- lawyerly response.
- I'm a lawyer.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.449
So, she said she was meeting
someone, but she didn't say...

06:02.492 --> 06:04.886
I didn't say it like that, Bull....it was Bradley Lena?

06:04.929 --> 06:07.323
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.414
She was a kid.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.415
Hey!

06:12.459 --> 06:15.113
Oh. Bull.
Hi.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.724
Uh, Bradley,
this is...

06:16.767 --> 06:18.160
Jason Bull. How are you?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.815
Uh, by the way,
congrats on that big win.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.034
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer oil company.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.167
Well, thank you, uh...

06:25.210 --> 06:26.908
You know, you take some
cases for the principle,

06:26.951 --> 06:28.605
you take some
for the payday.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.607
Sometimes, you win the
lotto and get both.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.786
So, what's going on?

06:35.830 --> 06:39.442
You guys discussing a way
our shops can team up?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.184
Actually, I was interested
in learning more

06:42.227 --> 06:43.664
about TAC's jury algorithm.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.144
We have a different
approach to voir dire,

06:46.188 --> 06:48.799
and Ms. Morgan agreed
to talk me through yours.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.236
Really?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.804
Uh-- No. Thank you for trying.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.893
You don't need to lie for me.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.982
We're here to talk about a job.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.811
Oh. What kind of case is it?

07:01.943 --> 07:04.554
No. A job.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.469
With Bradley.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.992
For me.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.258
Oh.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.748
Facial recognition works
by making a map of the face

07:24.792 --> 07:26.402
and measuring

07:26.446 --> 07:27.969
the space
between the eyes,

07:28.012 --> 07:30.101
the distance
from the chin to the nose.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.190
Then it runs the results
through databases

07:32.234 --> 07:33.670
looking for a match.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.238
It's a highly sophisticated
tool, but, as we've seen

07:36.281 --> 07:39.023
from Corey Rice's tragic case,
it's not always accurate,

07:39.067 --> 07:40.721
and, unfortunately,

07:40.764 --> 07:43.767
these systems often misidentify
the faces of people of color.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.726
Yeah, well, black and brown
folks been catching hell

07:45.769 --> 07:47.205
while companies
like V-Point

07:47.249 --> 07:48.598
have been cashing in.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.034
It's the same song.
It's a different verse.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.472
I think this is
on those cops.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.517
All they had to do
was look at Corey Rice

07:54.561 --> 07:55.953
before they opened fire.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.520
Instead, they were cowboys,
and they came in hot.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.217
That's what the other side's
gonna say.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.523
And what are we saying?

08:00.567 --> 08:03.091
We're saying that
V-Point was negligent,

08:03.134 --> 08:05.441
which led the cops
to target Corey,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.225
convinced that he was
the man that they wanted.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.271
V-Point lied, and Corey died.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.926
Well, it has a ring to it.
Can you prove it?

08:11.969 --> 08:13.405
We're gonna try.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.016
If we can prove that their
software isn't as accurate

08:15.059 --> 08:16.844
as they claim,
I think we're home free.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.541
We need to know
if any other departments

08:18.585 --> 08:19.760
have had cases like this.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.413
Cops who were misled
by over-reliance

08:21.457 --> 08:23.154
on V-Point's facial rec.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.330
I'll see what I can find, but...

08:25.374 --> 08:27.202
I still think Corey Rice's death
is on those cops.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.509
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.775
Hi. Can we talk?

08:34.818 --> 08:36.864
Let's.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.431
I want to apologize.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.303
That is not how
I wanted you to find out

08:41.346 --> 08:43.871
that I was considering
another job.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.222
First of all,
I completely understand.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.790
It's not my first rodeo.
I've seen this tactic before.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.400
Tactic?

08:51.443 --> 08:54.403
Yeah. You want to talk
about a raise,

08:54.446 --> 08:56.231
so you let me know
somebody else is interested.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.625
I get it. It's just that we've
worked together a long time,

08:58.668 --> 09:01.192
and I think you could've just
come and talked to me about it.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.194
Okay, Bull, it's not a tactic.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.805
I'm considering leaving TAC

09:04.848 --> 09:07.198
and going to work
for Bradley Lena.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.027
Why?

09:10.071 --> 09:11.376
Well, I think it's...

09:11.420 --> 09:13.596
pretty clear that I've been...

09:13.640 --> 09:14.815
unhappy for a while.

09:14.858 --> 09:15.859
Really? Is it clear?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.208
It's not to me.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.906
Oh, come on.
I-I've tried and tried

09:18.949 --> 09:20.385
to talk to you about this.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.561
The fight we had

09:21.604 --> 09:23.388
about me licensing
the algorithm.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.956
- Yeah. Didn't we work that out?
- No, we didn't work it out.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.871
You got arrested,

09:27.915 --> 09:30.308
which made everything
about you, again.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.659
Yeah, I'm-I'm so sorry
that my getting arrested

09:32.702 --> 09:35.052
got in the way
of your self-actualization.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.924
That is not what
I am talking about.

09:36.967 --> 09:39.883
Okay. Let's just
cut to the chase.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.668
What is it that you want?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.800
It's time for a little
transparency here, I think.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.802
Hi. Hello. I know, I know,

09:45.846 --> 09:48.805
I'm sorry to interrupt,
it's just the office is locked.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.416
- Uh, what office?
- Benny's old office.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.592
Benny's office?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.681
He said I could use it
because it's empty.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.031
He didn't tell you?

09:57.074 --> 09:59.511
I must have missed that
in all the transparency.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
Why don't I go grab you a key?

10:02.602 --> 10:05.126
Thanks.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.303
What did I just walk into?

10:10.522 --> 10:13.221
What a day.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.788
Yeah.

10:14.831 --> 10:18.008
I did not see the whole Izzy
in Benny's office thing coming.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.054
Me neither.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.320
I'm scared this means
you're gonna leave.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.192
Right now,
all it means is

10:28.236 --> 10:30.630
I am going home

10:30.673 --> 10:34.459
and pouring myself
a beautiful glass of wine.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.245
What is going on
- with your computer?
- What?

10:38.725 --> 10:41.031
Whoa, whoa!
Someone's attacking my system.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.250
Who?

10:42.293 --> 10:43.599
I-I don't know.
I just managed

10:43.643 --> 10:45.470
to get past Viridipoint's
proxy firewall.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.124
So it's someone
from V-Point?

10:47.168 --> 10:49.170
I don't think so.
I think this is someone else.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.477
"Back off"?

10:52.521 --> 10:54.175
No, no, no.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.481
I'm locked out.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.309
I've been hijacked.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.662
You want a glass
of wine, too?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.364
Mrs. Rice,

11:09.407 --> 11:10.931
it's just pretrial
motions today.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.193
You don't have to be here.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.498
Oh, I'm here, every day.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.891
You don't have
to worry about that.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.241
Hey. You're from
TAC, right?

11:17.285 --> 11:20.157
Vijay Paterson,
counsel for Viridipoint.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.682
We're in 1138.
Motion's been reassigned.

11:22.725 --> 11:23.987
Reassigned? What judge?

11:24.031 --> 11:26.642
- Preston.
- Preston? Never heard of him.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.818
It's a her.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.952
She's new. Just appointed.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.257
Is new good?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.564
We're gonna find out.
<i>Your Honor,</i>

11:35.607 --> 11:37.740
my client understands
the emotions involved,

11:37.784 --> 11:41.135
but the fact remains,
Viridipoint had no duty of care

11:41.178 --> 11:42.527
to Corey Rice.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.748
That duty rested solely
with the NYPD officers

11:45.792 --> 11:46.793
at the scene.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.882
As such, we ask
the court to grant

11:48.925 --> 11:50.405
our motion to dismiss.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.103
Your Honor, Viridipoint's
facial recognition software

11:53.147 --> 11:54.757
falsely identified

11:54.801 --> 11:57.325
Corey Rice
as a dangerous suspect.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.893
Mr. Rice's fatal shooting
at the hands of police

11:59.936 --> 12:02.896
who relied on the accuracy
of that software proves

12:02.939 --> 12:04.288
conclusively that

12:04.332 --> 12:06.421
the duty of care rests
with Viridipoint.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.945
Isn't it the NYPD's job

12:08.989 --> 12:10.599
to properly train its officers

12:10.642 --> 12:12.775
how to use tools
such as facial recognition?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.951
That's true, Your Honor, but... I'm skeptical

12:14.995 --> 12:17.824
that you have grounds
for wrongful death here.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.219
One moment, please, Your Honor.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.440
Just a hunch, but I don't
think she's buying it.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.615
Well, she's a new judge.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.877
She's just trying
to make her mark.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.226
You got a Plan B?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.837
I could argue
a civil rights violation,

12:30.880 --> 12:32.664
but that's more of a stretch
than wrongful death.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.927
I doubt she'll go
for that either.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.320
Well, we need something
she will go for.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.844
Well, do you have
any suggestions?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.715
'Cause in about ten seconds,
she's about to toss our case,

12:39.759 --> 12:40.934
and then we're nowhere.

12:40.977 --> 12:41.630
Okay, well, I'll come
up with something,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.414
just keep her talking.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.375
Your Honor,
if it please the court,

12:47.418 --> 12:50.160
we would like to amend
our existing complaint.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.249
Taylor, can you boot up
your hard drive,

12:52.293 --> 12:54.338
or whatever it is
you do with that thing.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.384
Now isn't a great time.
Oh.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.386
I'm sorry.
I will try and arrange

12:58.429 --> 13:00.301
my emergencies better
in the future.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.565
I'd love to help. I can't.
We're completely off-line and...

13:04.871 --> 13:06.437
Oh, wait. We're back.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.874
We're on line.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.701
Great. Listen, I need you
to do something for me.

13:09.745 --> 13:12.313
Yes, in about ten minutes
when my system reboots.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.359
I don't have time.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.839
You know what? Never mind.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.537
Viridipoint is a corporate entity.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.626
How does your
civil rights claim apply?

13:21.670 --> 13:23.890
Law enforcement is
a state function, Your Honor.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.849
By providing investigative leads
to the NYPD,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.547
Viridipoint is, in effect,
a state actor.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.550
I don't see it.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.161
Nice try, but I'm afraid
we're gonna...

13:35.684 --> 13:37.729
All right, everyone,
take it easy.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.035
We'll have
a brief recess

13:39.079 --> 13:41.124
while we get this sorted out.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.608
Everyone out
this way, please.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.177
Did you...?I plead the Fifth.
Let's go.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.358
We got five minutes
to come up with an argument

13:57.401 --> 13:59.839
that Judge Preston
won't kick.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.057
The judge called

14:01.101 --> 14:03.103
V-Point's facial recognition
program a tool.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.975
Yeah. "A tool is only as good
- as the user" argument, yeah.
- Right.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.978
So Corey Rice died
because V-Point's tool,

14:09.022 --> 14:11.328
its... product,

14:11.372 --> 14:13.113
didn't work as advertised,

14:13.156 --> 14:16.029
and that's not on the user.
That's false advertising.

14:16.072 --> 14:19.032
Wait a minute, you want to sue
for deceptive trade practice?

14:19.075 --> 14:21.599
Well, Don Quixote, you wanted
to tilt at windmills. Try it.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.732
- I got to go.
- You're not sticking around for this?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.690
Well, some schmuck
pulled the fire alarm.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.215
I can't stick around for that.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.086
Viridipoint misrepresented

14:30.130 --> 14:32.784
material facts to their
customers to perpetrate a fraud,

14:32.828 --> 14:34.308
and in so doing engaged

14:34.351 --> 14:36.049
in a pattern of deceptive
trade practices, Your Honor.

14:36.092 --> 14:39.052
Vernice Rice wasn't a customer
of Viridipoint, Your Honor.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.403
In that case, I don't see
how she has standing.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.884
<i>Remington v. Soto,</i>
Your Honor,

14:44.927 --> 14:48.017
where the Supreme Court upheld
the lower court's decision

14:48.061 --> 14:50.585
to allow the parents
of Sandy Hook victims

14:50.628 --> 14:52.935
to sue
the gun manufacturer Remington

14:52.979 --> 14:54.719
for marketing their guns
in a manner

14:54.763 --> 14:56.896
that would inspire
the shooter.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.116
That is a novel argument.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.424
I'd like to see if you
can make that stick.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.079
Motion to dismiss
is denied,

15:06.122 --> 15:07.732
but good luck

15:07.776 --> 15:09.909
convincing the jury, Mr. Palmer.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.781
I just spoke
to a friend at DHS.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.609
She said the hack
used to shut us down

15:14.652 --> 15:16.306
looks like the work
of a penetration tester

15:16.350 --> 15:18.482
known as "Tidal."

15:19.483 --> 15:21.094
What's a penetration tester?

15:21.137 --> 15:24.532
They're hackers who test
defenses in corporate systems.

15:24.575 --> 15:25.837
They look for holes,

15:25.881 --> 15:27.622
and when they find them,
sell the information

15:27.665 --> 15:29.145
to the company
so they can fix them.

15:29.189 --> 15:32.018
I was working a hole
in V-Point's firewall.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.063
I guess Tidal thought
I was competition,

15:34.107 --> 15:35.978
so she gave me a shove
to get me to back off.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.067
What do you want to do?

15:38.111 --> 15:38.981
Pay.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.330
Money's the only thing

15:40.374 --> 15:41.810
hackers like this
pay attention to.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.290
How much?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.683
20,000.

15:45.727 --> 15:48.599
You can have five,
and get a receipt.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.253
No problem.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.342
Hackers love
to give receipts.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.999
Chunk called. I will adjust
the juror algorithm

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
to account for the
new cause of action.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
Deceptive trade
practices, right?

16:01.047 --> 16:03.658
That's what
he sold them on.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.181
I need you to help me

16:05.225 --> 16:07.357
prepare someone
to take over the board

16:07.401 --> 16:09.446
in case you leave us
while we're working on this one.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.492
I won't walk out on you
in the middle of a case.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.189
Give me some credit.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.886
Well, I would have
before yesterday.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.714
All right, we have worked
together for 12 years.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.890
I know. Oh, is that
Mr. Lena checking in?

16:18.934 --> 16:20.718
All due respect,
that's none of your business.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.285
Okay.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.505
Listen. I think we can handle
this one without you.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.899
You got a lot going on.
You got a new job to consider,

16:27.943 --> 16:29.945
a lot on your plate.
We got this one.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.035
I... Who'll run the board?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.255
I will.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.827
Hey.
Hi.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.397
Is everything
all right?
Yup.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.662
Look, if Benny's
office is an issue,

16:51.706 --> 16:53.751
I can find
another place.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.753
The office
is not the problem.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.060
Well, Jason mentioned that

16:58.104 --> 17:00.758
you got a job offer,
and that you've been unhappy.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.283
At least he heard me
this time.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.938
He needs you.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.940
TAC cannot work
without you,

17:08.984 --> 17:10.768
and he knows it.
Really?

17:10.812 --> 17:13.771
Is that why he just
pulled me from the case?

17:13.815 --> 17:15.599
Well...
I never said

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
he's not an
idiot, but...

17:17.123 --> 17:18.950
Don't you dare say that
his heart's in the right place.

17:18.994 --> 17:22.606
He has been dismissing me
and my ideas for months.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.261
Look, I love TAC.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.133
I helped build it.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.570
It's my home.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.615
I want to stay, but...

17:31.659 --> 17:33.095
if he won't listen to me,

17:33.139 --> 17:36.533
won't acknowledge
what I'm bringing to the table,

17:36.577 --> 17:37.882
how can I?

17:49.285 --> 17:50.808
Excuse me.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.941
Hey, um...

17:52.984 --> 17:55.639
I'm having
computer problems.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.947
Have you tried unplugging it
and plugging it back in?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.384
I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.082
Maybe Tidal can help?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.781
That's you, right?

18:06.824 --> 18:08.696
I can't help you.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.524
You shut down my system

18:10.567 --> 18:12.917
because I found a gap
in Viridipoint's AI firewall.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.658
I need that gap to stay open.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.795
$5,000.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.233
It's yours...

18:24.277 --> 18:25.713
if you leave me alone.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.108
Oh, I'm gonna need...

18:29.151 --> 18:32.241
...$20,000 for that
to be worth my while.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.025
I don't have that.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.898
Then you still got a problem.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.508
Sorry, soccer mom.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.903
Uh, for the record,
my son does not play soccer,

18:41.946 --> 18:43.426
and I pulled off
the Whisper Mode hack

18:43.470 --> 18:44.862
while you were still
dancing on your bed

18:44.906 --> 18:46.690
under a poster of Avril Lavigne,

18:46.734 --> 18:49.040
so bite me.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.218
Yo.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.177
No way you pulled
off Whisper Mode.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.396
Oh, yeah, I did.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.745
Prove it.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.660
The point was
to remain anonymous.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.271
I didn't keep a bunch
of hard evidence against myself.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.838
Okay, well I know
a little bit about it.

19:03.881 --> 19:07.146
Tell me something
you can't read on Wikipedia.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.323
Um...

19:10.366 --> 19:12.020
Okay.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.892
everyone thinks I hacked

19:14.936 --> 19:18.461
the FBI, DHS, and GCHQ,
but I also hacked NASA.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.247
That's not generally known
because it was classified.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.205
Respect.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.816
Does that mean you'll back off
and let me do my work?

19:25.860 --> 19:28.297
Won't matter
if I back off.
Why not?

19:28.341 --> 19:30.821
That hole in the firewall
you were working?

19:30.865 --> 19:32.562
Viridipoint plugged it
up this morning.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.999
Great.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.131
I might know

19:36.175 --> 19:39.482
some other ways
into their servers.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.831
I could show you.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.269
Testing.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.879
Testing one, two, three.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.708
Rubber baby buggy bumper.
Rubber baby buggy bumper.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.537
Bull? Please stop.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.234
Just warming up my lips.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.976
So, has our data scientist
taken the stand yet?

19:55.019 --> 19:57.848
- So help me God.
- Just sworn in.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.937
Now, keep him out of the weeds.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.243
Nothing loses a jury faster

20:01.287 --> 20:03.985
than five-dollar words
and tech jargon.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.335
Dr. Gasden,

20:06.379 --> 20:08.642
you are an expert
in artificial intelligence,

20:08.685 --> 20:11.993
particularly with
facial recognition, correct?

20:12.036 --> 20:13.212
Yes.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.432
Doctor, I'd like to show you
a photograph

20:16.476 --> 20:17.781
of some footage from the

20:17.825 --> 20:19.740
security camera
that the police used

20:19.783 --> 20:21.220
to falsely identify

20:21.263 --> 20:24.048
Corey Rice
as a suspect. Now,

20:24.092 --> 20:26.747
in your expert opinion,

20:26.790 --> 20:29.053
is this footage conducive

20:29.097 --> 20:32.535
to finding an accurate match
using facial recognition?

20:32.579 --> 20:34.276
No.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.540
The dark lighting
and obscured facial features

20:37.584 --> 20:39.542
in that recording are...

20:39.586 --> 20:41.283
far from ideal.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.503
Given those conditions,

20:43.546 --> 20:46.332
the accuracy would only be
somewhere between...

20:46.375 --> 20:48.247
Mm...

20:48.290 --> 20:51.250
36 and...

20:51.293 --> 20:52.468
87%.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.600
Chunk, do something.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.601
They're falling asleep.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.560
Far from the 99.7%

20:57.604 --> 20:58.866
that V-Point touts.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.998
Can you explain
this discrepancy?

21:01.042 --> 21:04.132
It has to do with
eigenface values.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.047
Reel him back, Chester.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.049
Okay, um...

21:08.092 --> 21:10.181
Can you explain that
in layman's terms?

21:10.225 --> 21:11.879
What you're really describing

21:11.922 --> 21:14.142
is a set of eigenvectors

21:14.185 --> 21:16.579
relating to
the computer vision problem

21:16.623 --> 21:19.582
of human face recognition.
We're in the weeds.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.933
We are deep in the weeds.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.109
Well, you lost the jury
with Dr. Nerdly.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.155
If I didn't have someone
doing color commentary

21:27.198 --> 21:28.852
in my ear the whole time,

21:28.896 --> 21:30.332
I would've had a better
control of him.
Hey.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
Found a possible
witness for you.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.683
Salvador Johns.
Hartford PD.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.381
Retired.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.730
How can he help us?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.862
Well, he shot a man
during a traffic stop.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.429
The victim was
a Black HR manager

21:40.473 --> 21:43.214
who was misidentified as the
suspect in a police shooting.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.260
- And he's willing to testify?
- Oh, yeah.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.307
The way he sees it,
V-Point ruined his life.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.351
Well, that's two people
that have been

21:49.395 --> 21:50.483
misidentified by V-Point.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.093
The jury's got to feel that.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.052
You don't sound enthusiastic
about him.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.185
I don't like giving cops

21:57.228 --> 21:58.752
an excuse for killing
innocent people.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.102
I hear what you're saying,
but we've got to do something

22:01.145 --> 22:02.756
that's gonna break through
to this jury.

22:02.799 --> 22:06.063
We don't have a choice, Bull.
We have got to put him up.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.160
And you're in.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.295
And...

22:20.339 --> 22:23.124
here's your cash.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.691
I never would've
found that.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.475
Thank you.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.567
What are you
looking for?

22:31.611 --> 22:34.570
Some information Viridipoint
really doesn't want us to have

22:34.614 --> 22:36.442
that'll prove
they're responsible

22:36.485 --> 22:38.313
for an innocent
man's death.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.794
Well, if it's super-secret,

22:40.837 --> 22:43.318
probably not gonna find it
on their servers.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.494
Where would I find it?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.715
The CEO, Voight,

22:48.758 --> 22:50.891
he has an air-gapped computer
at his house.

22:50.934 --> 22:53.807
No connection to the Internet.
I would guess,

22:53.850 --> 22:56.375
for top secret stuff.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.160
So, I'd have to...

22:59.203 --> 23:01.205
physically get inside his house?

23:01.249 --> 23:04.252
If you want
what's on that server.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.257
Yeah, I think that would involve

23:09.300 --> 23:11.085
going a little further
outside the lines

23:11.128 --> 23:12.608
than I'm comfortable with.

23:12.652 --> 23:16.264
This from the woman
who pulled off Whisper Mode?

23:17.918 --> 23:20.703
I hate to admit it,
but I was younger then.

23:20.747 --> 23:24.011
Maybe I am a bit
of a soccer mom now.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.056
Well, if you change your mind,

23:26.100 --> 23:28.842
I've got some ideas.
Might be fun.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.713
I'm sure it would be.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.847
Hey, thanks again.

23:33.890 --> 23:36.110
No problem.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.155
Mr. Johns, is it fair to say

23:38.199 --> 23:40.419
that Viridipoint put a target

23:40.462 --> 23:43.465
on the back
of an innocent man?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.075
I never would've
gone at him like that

23:45.119 --> 23:48.078
if Viridipoint's facial rec
hadn't positively identified him

23:48.122 --> 23:50.603
as the maniac
who shot two cops.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.953
I feel terrible
about what happened.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.695
I killed an innocent person.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.653
I have to live with that
every day.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.700
So, the information provided to you

24:00.743 --> 24:02.484
by Viridipoint convinced you

24:02.528 --> 24:05.487
that you needed to use
lethal force?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.010
Yes, absolutely.

24:07.054 --> 24:10.100
Nothing further, Your Honor.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.103
Jury's with you. Nice work.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.323
Mr. Johns,

24:15.366 --> 24:17.760
how long were you with
the Hartford Police Department

24:17.804 --> 24:18.892
before you were fired?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.241
I wasn't fired.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.721
My mistake.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.245
How long before you

24:24.288 --> 24:26.421
left the department?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.162
15 years.

24:28.205 --> 24:30.512
In those 15 years,
you had more than a dozen

24:30.556 --> 24:33.384
excessive force complaints
against you, isn't that true?

24:33.428 --> 24:35.474
Every cop on the
street gets those.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.389
Look at my record.
I was never formally disciplined

24:38.433 --> 24:39.652
because I did
the job right.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.915
Hmm. How many
of those complaints

24:41.958 --> 24:43.786
were filed by African Americans?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.051
I mean...

24:48.095 --> 24:51.359
my precinct was 80 to 90% Black.

24:51.402 --> 24:52.491
It's only natural.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.144
It's only natural

24:54.188 --> 24:55.755
that you assault
African Americans,

24:55.798 --> 24:57.278
or it's only natural
that none of their complaints

24:57.321 --> 24:58.366
led to any charges?

24:58.409 --> 24:59.759
Objection.
Inflammatory.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.195
Sustained.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.113
The innocent man you shot,

25:06.156 --> 25:07.941
he was African American,
wasn't he?

25:07.984 --> 25:10.509
Yes. But that's not...

25:10.552 --> 25:13.033
Is that why you opened fire?
Because it was only natural?

25:13.076 --> 25:14.295
Objection, Your Honor,

25:14.338 --> 25:16.166
the counsel is badgering
the witness.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.167
Sustained.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.952
Dial it back, Counselor.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.475
I'll rephrase.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.000
Isn't it true that 12 of
the 13 complaints against you

25:24.044 --> 25:26.002
were filed by African Americans?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.569
I know what you're
trying to do.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.397
You're trying to paint me
like I'm some kind of a racist.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.572
Are you a racist?

25:30.616 --> 25:31.617
I don't have a racist bone
in my body.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.705
My partner was Black.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.582
Oh, no.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.542
Damn it.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.587
No further questions.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.024
Court will take a brief recess.

25:49.243 --> 25:53.639
Mrs. Rice.

25:53.682 --> 25:54.770
Please, can we talk?

25:54.814 --> 25:56.816
Can we talk?
Mrs. Rice, please, listen,

25:56.859 --> 25:57.991
listen.
I am so sorry.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.645
I know that
you're angry.

25:59.688 --> 26:03.083
Since the day my son
was taken from me,

26:03.126 --> 26:05.128
all I've been is angry.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.608
Anger won't bring him back.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.349
I know I should've prepared you
for that witness.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.872
I...
You should know

26:09.916 --> 26:11.134
I would rather lose

26:11.178 --> 26:13.223
than have a man like that

26:13.267 --> 26:14.790
speak for my son.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.052
I understand,
but we have to

26:16.096 --> 26:17.706
try to show the jury
what V-Point has done,

26:17.750 --> 26:19.142
and he was a way
to do that.

26:19.186 --> 26:22.276
The only reason
I'm holding onto this pain,

26:22.319 --> 26:24.278
the senselessness
of all of this,

26:24.321 --> 26:27.020
is to make my son's death
mean something.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.804
- I want that, too.
- If you thought

26:28.848 --> 26:33.026
putting a man who robbed another
Black mother of her child

26:33.069 --> 26:34.984
on the stand
was the right thing to do,

26:35.028 --> 26:37.726
then you never understood
what I was trying to accomplish,

26:37.770 --> 26:40.599
and you damn sure
never understood my son.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.046
Hey.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.308
Hey, yourself.

26:54.351 --> 26:56.571
Heard court was
a little rough.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.268
That's one way
to describe it.

26:58.312 --> 27:00.140
You'll get the jury back.
You always do.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.576
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.099
I don't even know if we're
gonna get the client back.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.753
Did you find any

27:04.797 --> 27:06.799
test results,
anything that would prove

27:06.842 --> 27:09.236
V-Point's facial rec
is not as accurate

27:09.279 --> 27:10.541
- as they claim?
- No.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.673
I've looked
all over their system.

27:11.717 --> 27:12.979
Nothing that can help us.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.111
That's too bad.
I really could've use that data.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.373
There is...

27:16.417 --> 27:19.159
actually one other thing
I could try.

27:19.202 --> 27:22.205
Great. What is it?

27:22.249 --> 27:24.251
The less you know
about it, the better.

27:30.779 --> 27:31.998
Tidal.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.869
Soccer mom.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.132
You still up for an adventure?

27:53.454 --> 27:56.065
22 floors. Not a word.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.677
How's it
gotten this bad?

27:58.720 --> 28:01.027
Well, she seemed pretty upset
when I spoke to her.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.898
Really?

28:02.942 --> 28:04.595
What did she say?

28:04.639 --> 28:06.859
That she loves TAC,

28:06.902 --> 28:09.035
but she feels
disrespected.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.601
Disrespected?

28:10.645 --> 28:13.866
I mean, we had our disagreements
over the year, but...

28:13.909 --> 28:15.606
disrepect-- I mean...

28:15.650 --> 28:18.435
I-I have the utmost
respect for Marissa.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.655
Well, I can't speak to
what happened between you two.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.744
I'm just telling you
how she feels.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.572
I know.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.269
So, what did
you tell her?

28:26.313 --> 28:27.401
I said she should do

28:27.444 --> 28:29.272
whatever makes
her happy.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.926
I thought you were on my side.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.102
I am on your side.

28:33.146 --> 28:36.105
- Your side wants Marissa happy.
- Really...

28:36.149 --> 28:38.412
You know, I asked her
what she wanted.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.109
She just wouldn'ttell me.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.158
My dear,

28:45.201 --> 28:46.594
lovely,

28:46.637 --> 28:48.291
sometimes self-obsessed
husband,

28:48.335 --> 28:49.989
has it been possible
that she's been

28:50.032 --> 28:53.383
telling you what she needs,
and you haven't been listening?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.037
Oh.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.823
Yeah. So...

28:57.866 --> 29:00.695
Tell me what I should do.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.566
She's trying to decide
what's right for her.

29:02.610 --> 29:06.092
Make staying at TAC
her best choice.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.675
I like the outfit.

29:24.719 --> 29:25.981
Bloomingdales,

29:26.025 --> 29:27.809
Fall Misdemeanor
Collection?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.245
Funny.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.900
Did you get me
a Trojan Horse?

29:31.944 --> 29:34.816
I went through Voight's
credit card transactions.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.600
He ordered a speaker just like
this one two days ago.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.037
If we leave it
on his doorstep,

29:38.080 --> 29:40.300
he'll think it just
arrived early.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.824
So... what's it
delivering?

29:42.868 --> 29:46.175
This is a Raspberry Pi with
a few tweaks of my own design.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.481
Once it's inside,

29:47.524 --> 29:49.178
it can use any
nearby Wi-Fi signal

29:49.222 --> 29:51.833
to infiltrate Voight's
entire home network,

29:51.877 --> 29:54.009
even...
...his air-gapped server.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.228
Slick.

29:55.271 --> 29:58.231
Fun working outside
the lines, isn't it?

29:58.274 --> 30:00.668
You know, when you
hijacked my system,

30:00.711 --> 30:03.671
I wanted to punch you
in the face, but...

30:03.714 --> 30:06.282
I have to admit,
I kind of needed this.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.243
Cool.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.826
Can we talk?

30:31.090 --> 30:33.266
There is no TAC without you.

30:33.309 --> 30:36.573
And I know I haven't
always acted like that.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.838
I am sorry.

30:41.274 --> 30:42.797
Thank you.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.061
I know I can be
a little inflexible.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.803
Really?
Yeah.

30:51.327 --> 30:54.287
I want you to have
whatever it is you need

30:54.330 --> 30:57.246
to be happy here at TAC,

30:57.290 --> 30:58.813
and I will match
whatever it is

30:58.857 --> 31:02.208
Mr. Bradley Lena
is offering you, plus 20%.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.340
And it's

31:04.384 --> 31:07.648
your algorithm, so whatever
you want to do with it,

31:07.691 --> 31:09.171
we will do.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.957
And the office.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.829
Obviously.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.614
You will have your own office.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.142
That's very generous, Bull.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.713
Give me time to think about it.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.548
I don't need to think about it.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.291
The answer is yes.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.598
Good answer.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.603
Now, I'm gonna go back to work.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.350
Morning.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.180
Did that plan I'm not
supposed to know about

32:01.223 --> 32:03.312
produce anything
I should know about?

32:03.356 --> 32:06.315
Well, I was able to access
Voight's private,

32:06.359 --> 32:08.448
air-gapped server but, sadly,

32:08.491 --> 32:09.971
I didn't find any test results,

32:10.015 --> 32:12.278
just some financial documents.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.714
Well, thanks
for trying anyway.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.630
I just got a text
from V-Point's attorney.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.327
They want to discuss
a settlement.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.329
But they're winning.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.765
That's what's weird,

32:21.809 --> 32:23.942
but Bull always said
that he thought this thing

32:23.985 --> 32:25.291
would end up
in a settlement conference.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.901
I guess he was right.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.555
What happens now?

32:28.598 --> 32:30.949
Convince our client to accept
a settlement she doesn't want

32:30.992 --> 32:32.341
or lose in court.

32:34.517 --> 32:35.997
V-Point's offer is substantial.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.043
And they've agreed to suspend licensing

32:38.086 --> 32:40.088
the facial recognition
software to

32:40.132 --> 32:42.308
New York state law enforcement.

32:42.351 --> 32:45.224
The police couldn't
use it anymore?

32:45.267 --> 32:48.009
In New York state.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.142
Elsewhere, they can.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.885
Where's the other shoe?
What do they want?

32:54.929 --> 32:58.193
There's a non-disparagement
clause, which means that

32:58.237 --> 33:01.196
you would have to refrain from
making any public statements

33:01.240 --> 33:04.243
that were critical
of V-Point or its technology,

33:04.286 --> 33:05.635
forever.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.160
They want me to go away.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.554
Forget Corey ever existed.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.688
They are buying
your silence, yes.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.996
That money they're offering...

33:19.606 --> 33:23.479
I know charities that could
put it to good use.

33:23.523 --> 33:27.788
And for the NYPD to give up
facial recognition...

33:29.398 --> 33:30.617
That's something.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.053
It is, and

33:32.097 --> 33:34.186
if we go in front of a jury,

33:34.229 --> 33:36.362
I promise you,

33:36.405 --> 33:39.843
you'll get nothing,
absolutely nothing.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.287
Would you sign it?

33:48.330 --> 33:51.594
If it meant I had to be silent
about the death of my child,

33:51.638 --> 33:54.771
I would politely tell them
how to fold that offer,

33:54.815 --> 33:57.687
and I would tell them
exactly where to put it.

34:01.996 --> 34:05.565
I wasn't raised to be a quitter.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.828
No sense starting now.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.963
Corey always called me

34:13.007 --> 34:15.618
as soon as he
got to work.

34:15.662 --> 34:18.708
He worked a lot of nights.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.841
Didn't matter how late,

34:20.884 --> 34:23.278
he always made sure
to let me know

34:23.322 --> 34:25.628
he was all right...

34:25.672 --> 34:27.413
but not that night.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.110
Mrs. Rice,

34:29.154 --> 34:30.981
when you found out
that Corey was dead,

34:31.025 --> 34:33.680
did the authorities tell you
what had happened?

34:33.723 --> 34:36.639
I was told my son

34:36.683 --> 34:38.467
had been misidentified

34:38.511 --> 34:41.122
by an algorithm.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.820
An algorithm.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.954
How can you protect
against an algorithm?

34:48.434 --> 34:50.479
I taught my son

34:50.523 --> 34:53.178
keep your hands in the open,

34:53.221 --> 34:55.397
walk, don't run.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.182
"Yes, Officer.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.053
No, Officer."

35:00.315 --> 35:03.666
That's what we need
to teach our children

35:03.710 --> 35:07.148
so they can get through
this world.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.063
To survive.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.721
He did everything
he was supposed to,

35:14.764 --> 35:17.245
but they still put
a target on his back

35:17.289 --> 35:20.292
because some machine
said it was all right.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.947
Mrs. Rice, you don't believe

35:23.991 --> 35:26.036
Viridipoint's claim of being

35:26.080 --> 35:29.344
99.7% accurate, do you?

35:30.911 --> 35:32.956
Not for my son.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.264
Not for anyone whose
skin looked like his.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.312
He was a fine
young man,

35:40.355 --> 35:43.358
and he would've had so
much to give this world

35:43.402 --> 35:45.055
if someone at Viridipoint hadn't

35:45.099 --> 35:48.276
thrown up their hands
and said, "Close enough."

35:48.320 --> 35:50.322
No.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.193
I can't accept that.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.282
Not if "close enough"

35:54.326 --> 35:57.764
means someone else might
have to bury their child.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.422
No.

36:04.466 --> 36:07.252
I have nothing further, Your Honor.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.610
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

36:17.653 --> 36:19.177
have you reached a verdict?

36:19.220 --> 36:22.310
We have, Your Honor.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.488
We the jury find the defendant,

36:26.532 --> 36:29.839
Viridipoint AI,

36:29.883 --> 36:33.321
not liable under
the consumer protection laws

36:33.365 --> 36:34.540
of the State of New York.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.237
The court thanks the members

36:36.281 --> 36:37.804
of the jury
for their service.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.154
Court is adjourned.

36:48.728 --> 36:51.470
Mrs. Rice, I'm not sure
I deserve that.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.170
You let my son speak.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.129
Everyone in this courtroom
knows who he was

36:59.173 --> 37:02.437
and what was taken from him.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.222
You gave me that much.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.311
We still lost,

37:06.354 --> 37:09.270
and I don't know why
I'm not surprised.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.924
Corey used to say,

37:10.967 --> 37:12.404
"Fight for keeps,

37:12.447 --> 37:15.276
so you can keep fighting."

37:15.320 --> 37:17.670
So, keep fighting.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.500
Keep fighting.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.462
Goodbye, Dr. Bull.

37:27.506 --> 37:30.378
It's been an honor,
Mrs. Rice.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.300
I keep thinking about <i>
V-point's settlement offer.</i>

37:39.344 --> 37:40.910
What about it?

37:40.954 --> 37:43.043
Well, people try to settle
'cause they're scared of losing.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.697
Yeah, usually.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.308
When they made the offer,
they were winning, no question,

37:47.352 --> 37:48.831
so what are they
scared of?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.404
The financial documents
that Taylor dug up

37:56.448 --> 38:00.147
contain two sets of books.
One public, one private.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.367
V-Point's a publicly
held company.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.717
If they've been feeding
investors fake numbers,

38:04.760 --> 38:06.284
that is securities fraud.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.850
Yup.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.591
Securities fraud?
What did I miss?

38:09.635 --> 38:12.899
I think we just figured out why
V-Point was so keen to settle.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.422
Their offer came right after

38:14.466 --> 38:16.511
Taylor hacked into Voight's
super-secret computer,

38:16.555 --> 38:19.645
which made us wonder if he knew
he'd been hacked and was scared

38:19.688 --> 38:20.820
about what
we might find.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.648
So, Voight offered
to settle,

38:22.691 --> 38:25.955
so we would stop digging
and not find his cooked books.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.914
He must've crapped his pants
when we turned him down.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.655
He thought we were
gonna bust him.

38:29.698 --> 38:32.701
Well, is there anyone
stopping us from doing that now?

38:32.745 --> 38:34.573
Well, the way Taylor got these was not what

38:34.616 --> 38:36.096
you'd call kosher.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.751
We release them, we put her
in legal jeopardy.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.363
Right, but there's got to be
a way around that.

38:42.407 --> 38:46.454
Hey, doesn't the SEC
have an anonymous tip line?

38:47.890 --> 38:49.414
Why, yes.

38:49.457 --> 38:50.937
Yes, it does.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.243
Mr. Voight!
Mr. Voight! Mr. Voight!

38:53.287 --> 38:55.550
What do you have to say
about the accusations?

38:55.594 --> 38:57.900
They just said Voight
is facing 20 years

38:57.944 --> 38:59.641
and up to $12 million
in fines.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.383
Yeah, and the company's
filing for bankruptcy.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.646
So long, Viridipoint.

39:05.995 --> 39:09.521
This just came
for you. Wine club?

39:09.564 --> 39:11.610
Not unless you signed me up.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.404
Who's that from?

39:23.448 --> 39:25.972
Me,

39:26.015 --> 39:27.800
a long time ago.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.063
I'm going to get some food.
Want to come?

39:30.106 --> 39:31.630
Uh, thanks, but...

39:31.673 --> 39:33.545
I need to make a call.

39:36.809 --> 39:37.810
Marissa!

39:37.853 --> 39:39.289
Oh...

39:39.333 --> 39:41.857
Why do I feel like a man
who's about to be let down easy?

39:41.901 --> 39:45.513
Bradley, your offer
was incredibly generous,

39:45.557 --> 39:47.472
but...

39:47.515 --> 39:49.299
I'm afraid my answer is no.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.694
Well... you'd be a tremendous
asset to any company

39:52.738 --> 39:55.958
for all the reasons
I've stated repeatedly,

39:56.002 --> 39:58.613
but the thing I like
about you most of all

39:58.657 --> 40:00.876
is your sense of loyalty.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.356
Thank you.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.010
Look, I know we went over

40:04.053 --> 40:06.142
the compensation package
earlier, but...

40:06.186 --> 40:09.581
there was one perk
I didn't mention.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.147
Can I show it to you?

40:11.191 --> 40:12.714
Sure.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.417
What do you think?

40:32.560 --> 40:34.562
You got a minute?

40:34.606 --> 40:36.912
Hey. You bet I do.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.566
In fact...

40:38.610 --> 40:39.915
I'm glad you came by,

40:39.959 --> 40:42.265
because I got
a little something

40:42.309 --> 40:44.877
I wanted us to share once
you signed your deal memo,

40:44.920 --> 40:47.227
but, what the heck,
let's crack her open now.

40:48.576 --> 40:49.925
2010 Barolo.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.884
Don't ask how much
it cost, 'cause...

40:51.927 --> 40:53.233
it would make me blush.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.061
You didn't have to do that.

40:55.104 --> 40:58.586
Yes, I did, and
that is precisely

40:58.630 --> 40:59.935
the point.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.939
Isn't that the best sound
in the world?

41:05.941 --> 41:09.467
I have to tell you something.

41:13.514 --> 41:16.125
You're leaving...

41:16.169 --> 41:17.692
to work with Lena.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.043
I'm sorry.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.134
But...

41:25.178 --> 41:26.962
Okay.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.661
We... did talk,

41:29.704 --> 41:31.358
and I was giving you everything

41:31.401 --> 41:33.926
- that you wanted.
- You are.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.581
But...

41:36.624 --> 41:39.235
What is he giving you?

41:44.327 --> 41:46.591
You... Okay.

41:46.634 --> 41:48.680
You want your name
above the door?

41:48.723 --> 41:50.551
You never asked for that.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.466
Mm, you're right, I didn't.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.946
With him, I didn't have to.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.862
Okay, well, technically,
my name's not above the door

41:56.905 --> 41:59.038
'cause it's just TAC,
but if you would like to change

41:59.081 --> 42:00.430
the name of the company... I want to be somewhere

42:00.474 --> 42:02.128
- my value is known.
- You are...

42:02.171 --> 42:05.653
Not something that I have
to argue for or negotiate.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.355
I'm gonna go get my things.

42:12.399 --> 42:14.444
I'll be out in an hour.

42:17.752 --> 42:18.536
Goodbye.
