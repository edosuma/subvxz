00:54.767 --> 00:57.700
Give me a break.
This is highway robbery.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.800
I'm on a fixed income.

00:59.867 --> 01:01.867
$50 is my limit.

01:02.367 --> 01:06.000
Ok. I'm desperate.
You got a deal. 60.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.900
Good news.
I got you a date for the banquet.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.100
I'll get my own date.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.900
Fine. Pay a hundred.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.633
Here. Help me finish
these invitations.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.467
Hi, girls.

01:19.533 --> 01:20.834
Boy, am I stuffed.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.433
I must have sampled food
from 10 caterers.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.867
Find one for the banquet?

01:24.934 --> 01:26.033
Not yet,

01:26.100 --> 01:30.200
but I did learn that baked Alaska
can actually be cooked locally.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.233
Rose, I have an even bigger
scoop for you.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.000
Mars bars are made
right here on earth.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.633
Oh, girls,
this time I've really done it.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.600
The hospital charity banquet
will be in the Versailles room

01:50.667 --> 01:52.166
of the Bedford hotel.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.533
The committee is on a budget.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.266
Don't worry.
I worked out a special deal.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.667
We can't afford that room.

01:58.734 --> 02:03.367
I told the manager
if he'd let us have that room,

02:03.433 --> 02:06.834
my sister would sing
for free in his piano bar.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.467
Your sister Virginia?

02:08.533 --> 02:11.633
No, I mean my sister
miss Susan Anton.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.000
-How could you tell such a lie?
-He didn't believe me.

02:17.066 --> 02:20.567
He said I was too attractive
to be her relative.

02:21.467 --> 02:24.767
He gave us the room
because he liked my moxie.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.967
I bet you liked
showing it to him.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.700
We have a place.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.266
Now all we need is a caterer.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.467
One's dropping by
this afternoon.

02:34.533 --> 02:36.433
Did you hire the band?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.033
That was Rose's job.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.000
I warn you, we may end up

02:40.066 --> 02:43.066
with the Hans Gerflugenhaben
yodeling quartet.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.633
-(doorbell rings)
-That's not true. They broke up.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.166
But the Sonia Von Kugel
Tuba band is free.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.300
Hi. I'm Jake Smollens
from V.I.P. catering.

02:55.367 --> 02:59.133
Hello. I'm Rose Nylund
from St. Olaf, Minnesota.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.166
These are my friends Dorothy and--

03:02.233 --> 03:04.500
Blanche.
Blanche Devereaux.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.967
I'm chairman
of the planning committee.

03:07.033 --> 03:10.567
Could you tell us something
about your background?

03:10.633 --> 03:12.900
I've run V.I.P. catering five years.

03:12.967 --> 03:15.867
I was a navy cook for 25 years.

03:15.934 --> 03:19.400
I can cook chipped beef for 1,500
or chateaubriand for 2.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.166
No, Mr. Smollens.
What I meant was are you married?

03:23.667 --> 03:26.133
No, I'm not.
And please, call me Jake.

03:26.633 --> 03:27.800
My pleasure.

03:27.867 --> 03:30.033
I once had an uncle Jake.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.133
He could never cook.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.700
He also couldn't get through
our family 4th of July picnic

03:34.767 --> 03:36.700
without unzipping his overalls.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.600
Too bad he can't come
to the banquet.

03:41.367 --> 03:48.033
So tell me, Jake, how much do
you think these meals will cost?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.433
Do you want something
simple or fancy?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.033
We want something cheap.

03:52.934 --> 03:55.834
-I admire your honesty.
-I admire your chest.

03:59.367 --> 04:04.400
I mean, exactly what kind of meal
are we talking about?

04:04.467 --> 04:07.266
A nice yankee pot roast,
mashed potatoes,

04:07.333 --> 04:09.500
mixed vegetables, green salad.

04:09.567 --> 04:13.100
And I'll throw in
my special clam chowder. No charge.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.533
That sounds delicious.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.533
Just consider yourself hired.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.000
Now, Jake, when shall
I come to your place to...

04:20.734 --> 04:22.200
sample what you have to offer?

04:24.734 --> 04:26.567
I got a better idea.

04:26.633 --> 04:30.600
There's a romantic diner
on the boardwalk.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.400
I'll pick you up around 8
tomorrow night,

04:32.467 --> 04:34.433
and we'll check out a few things.

04:34.934 --> 04:36.867
I thought you'd never ask.

04:36.934 --> 04:39.600
-I'll see you tomorrow night.
-Ok.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.834
-Nice meeting you, ladies.
-Nice meeting, you.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.934
It was our pleasure.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.467
Wow. What a hunk.

04:50.533 --> 04:53.433
I know. Eat your hearts out.

04:53.500 --> 04:58.467
Did it occur to you Rose
or I might be interested in Jake?

04:58.533 --> 04:59.533
Yes.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.000
You still used every cheap ploy
to nab him?

05:03.066 --> 05:03.734
Yes.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.834
What do you have to say
for yourself?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.333
Damn, I'm good.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.266
Well, what do you think?
Isn't this romantic?

05:21.767 --> 05:24.133
Oh, yes, it certainly is.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.266
If you happen to be Popeye.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.834
Hiya, Jake.
What can I do for you?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.400
We'd like the best table
in the house.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.266
You got it, buddy.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.033
Ah, this is great.
Thanks.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.934
-We'll have the usual.
-All right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.834
Are you sure this is
the best table in the house?

05:41.900 --> 05:43.266
Did you get a splinter
when you sat down?

05:43.333 --> 05:44.000
No.

05:44.066 --> 05:45.700
Then this is the best table
in the house.

05:46.567 --> 05:48.500
-You're pulling my leg.
-No, but I'd like to.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.300
Oh. Stop being naughty.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.467
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.834
Neither did I.
Be naughty again.

05:54.333 --> 05:55.934
Blanche,
you are one hell of a woman.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.066
I know. Heh-heh. Go on.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.834
Well, I've been just about
everywhere there is,

06:00.900 --> 06:03.500
but in all my years in the navy,
I've never met anybody like you.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.300
Well, in all my years
dating the navy,

06:05.367 --> 06:07.233
I never met anybody like you.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.200
Jake, is it my imagination

06:11.266 --> 06:14.233
or is there a tattoo in the shape of
a nose on your arm?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.300
Yeah.

06:17.367 --> 06:20.333
I got that when I first joined
the navy, back in '51.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.800
I was just a kid,
I was drunk out of my mind.

06:22.867 --> 06:25.200
Unfortunately, so was the guy
who gave me the tattoo.

06:25.266 --> 06:27.533
I asked for a Rose,
he thought I said a nose.

06:29.266 --> 06:30.433
Thanks.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.633
Blanche...

06:35.066 --> 06:36.834
I really like being out with you.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.533
I really like being out
with you too.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.000
Mmm.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.800
-This looks delicious.
-Oh, wait a minute.

06:45.867 --> 06:48.700
Before you eat that,
there's just one thing.

06:48.767 --> 06:49.867
What?

06:54.433 --> 06:56.834
It tastes better if your lips
are warmed up first.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.400
I'm beginning to see
why this place is so romantic.

07:23.934 --> 07:26.233
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.700
For my next number,

07:27.767 --> 07:32.467
something by one of my favorites
and I hope, one of yours,

07:32.533 --> 07:34.667
Huey Lewis and The News!

07:34.734 --> 07:38.100
Wait!
We've heard enough, Mr. Hinkley.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.834
Ok. Right to the big finale!

07:40.900 --> 07:42.600
We've run out of time.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.800
It's a guaranteed show-stopper.

07:44.867 --> 07:47.934
I hold up two lit sparklers
with my hands

07:48.033 --> 07:50.934
and play "Hey, look me over"
with my feet!

07:51.000 --> 07:52.333
While smoking a cigarette?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
-No.
-Oh, darn. You were this close.

07:57.667 --> 08:01.000
-Goodbye.
-Dorothy, we're in trouble.

08:01.066 --> 08:03.133
We've auditioned
a dozen musicians.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.066
The banquet is two weeks away.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.934
We have no band.
What will we do?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.500
What we're going to do
is eat a cheesecake.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.767
Hi, Ma.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.934
Shouldn't you be finishing
those invitations?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.867
I'm just here for some water.
Stamp-licking dries me out.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.500
Use a sponge.

08:23.567 --> 08:26.066
I feel more comfortable
drinking out of a glass.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.767
Don't you and Jake
have dinner reservations?

08:35.834 --> 08:39.433
-Yes, we do. He's late.
-I'm sure he has a good reason.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.300
If not, who cares?
He's a dreamboat.

08:43.367 --> 08:46.000
These weeks with Jake
have been wonderful,

08:46.066 --> 08:48.633
but there's some things
I can't get used to.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.800
Like what?

08:50.867 --> 08:52.934
It's breeding.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.867
He uses his fingers
to push his food.

08:55.934 --> 08:57.734
He tucks his napkin
into his collar.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.200
He wears white after labor day.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.200
The man is a winner.

09:04.266 --> 09:05.500
What's the matter with you?

09:05.567 --> 09:08.166
Maybe I'm just overly critical.

09:08.233 --> 09:11.166
That sometimes happens
when you're stunningly beautiful.

09:11.233 --> 09:14.133
Not to mention
endlessly irritating.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.433
Blanche, Jake's here.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.834
Make yourself at home
and don't touch anything.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.400
-Hi, everybody.
-You are filthy!

09:22.467 --> 09:25.467
I was helping a lady
stranded on the road

09:25.533 --> 09:27.433
and ended up fixing
her transmission.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.900
Aren't there people doing
that for a living?

09:29.967 --> 09:31.700
Andy Granatelli does.

09:32.834 --> 09:35.033
He doesn't fix them himself.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.467
He doesn't want to get his
trench coat dirty.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.800
I hear he has this special school
in Wisconsin,

09:40.867 --> 09:42.467
I know. Shut up, Rose.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.800
Don't be mad.
I'll make it up to you.

09:47.867 --> 09:51.233
I'll pack a picnic basket,
we'll drive to the beach,

09:51.300 --> 09:54.633
spread a blanket on the sand
underneath the stars.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.767
-I'll take you in my arms--
-I forgive you.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.533
I mean, Blanche should forgive you.

10:04.033 --> 10:07.967
Oh, all right. I forgive you,
but forget the picnic.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.600
I'll get us that blanket.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.166
-He's a wonderful man.
-Oh, I know.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.934
Why can't I ever
attract men like that?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.967
-You can, Dorothy.
-You really think so?

10:27.033 --> 10:30.200
Of course, not, but would
I tell you that? I'm your mother.

10:39.734 --> 10:42.600
Ma, are you sure you mailed
all the invitations?

10:42.667 --> 10:45.567
None of the G's through the O's
has responded.

10:45.633 --> 10:46.600
Of course, I did.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.333
They were in the shoebox
I took to the post office last week.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.934
-Unless...
-Unless what?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.266
Unless I sent my best pair
of heels overnight mail.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.433
Ma, this is terrible.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.967
You're telling me, now I don't
have shoes for the party.

11:03.233 --> 11:06.266
Girls, I am so excited.
We have a band.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.400
-You hired somebody?
-Yup. The Great Pretenders.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.400
It's an all-female jazz band.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.467
They're supposed
to be fantastic.

11:13.533 --> 11:16.633
Well, now,
it's going to be a good party.

11:16.700 --> 11:20.633
It's too bad you couldn't find
a better date than Harvey.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.367
Well, I wouldn't brag about
my date if were you.

11:24.433 --> 11:28.667
Is Walter renting
that blue tuxedo again?

11:28.734 --> 11:32.367
Walter never rented
a blue tuxedo and you know it.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.333
He owns that blue tuxedo.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.734
Girls, did Jake call?
He's half an hour late.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.900
No, Blanche.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.233
Will Jake take you to the banquet,
or is he working catering it?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.834
He could take me,
but my date is Hunter McCoy.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.000
-But what about Jake?
-What about it?

11:52.066 --> 11:54.467
Jake has to take you
to the benefit.

11:54.533 --> 11:56.266
You'll both be there.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.467
He'll expect you to be there
with him.

11:58.533 --> 12:00.033
How could you do this?

12:00.100 --> 12:03.633
You make it sound so terrible.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.367
Jake doesn't belong
with certain people.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.667
He's a blue jeans guy.

12:08.734 --> 12:11.600
This is a black tie affair.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.700
Sometimes you act like a woman
I knew in St. Olaf.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.467
Please, no one say,
"what woman?"

12:21.233 --> 12:24.600
Jake is crazy about you.
You'll break his heart.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.433
Don't be silly.

12:26.500 --> 12:30.600
Jake knows I care for him, but our
relationship can only go so far.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.400
He knows that.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.333
-(doorbell rings)
-That's probably him.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.000
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, sweetheart.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.033
Hello, everybody.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.567
Is there somewhere
we could be alone?

12:52.633 --> 12:54.867
-Can't it wait until after dinner?
-No.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.900
All right.
I'm flexible.

12:57.967 --> 12:59.500
Of course,
you know that already.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.000
No, no, no, no.

13:02.066 --> 13:06.500
I want to ask you something now,
right here where we first met.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.667
Ma, Rose, let's go into the kitchen.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.867
-What, and miss all this?
-Get up.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.333
Jake, listen.
I know what you want to ask me.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.867
I've given our relationship
a great deal of thought lately.

13:27.934 --> 13:29.667
You're a wonderful man.

13:29.734 --> 13:33.500
I love all the time
we spend together,

13:33.567 --> 13:36.433
but we do come
from two different worlds.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.800
So our relationship
can only go so far.

13:39.867 --> 13:42.367
That's why I can't go
to the banquet with you.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.266
Well...

13:46.600 --> 13:47.900
that's not what
I was going to ask you,

13:47.967 --> 13:50.834
but... you answered
my question anyway.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.266
Why?
I don't understand.

13:55.266 --> 13:57.066
I was going to ask you to marry me.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.300
Rose,
what are you doing up?

14:17.367 --> 14:20.300
I keep having nightmares
about the banquet.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.433
Oh? What kind of nightmares?

14:23.767 --> 14:25.767
I'm at the banquet.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.233
It looks beautiful.
I look beautiful.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.000
Everybody looks beautiful.

14:30.066 --> 14:33.433
Suddenly, Charlton Heston walks
in dressed like Moses...

14:34.700 --> 14:37.400
and he tries to part
the dessert table.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.000
When that doesn't work,
he rounds up the guests

14:42.066 --> 14:43.734
and leads them
to the lingerie department

14:43.800 --> 14:45.667
of the nearest J.C. Penney's...

14:47.066 --> 14:50.166
where everybody makes fun of
the fat lady underwear.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.200
What does it mean?

14:54.266 --> 14:57.000
That you spent too many years
sleeping on curlers.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.333
Ma, you can't sleep, either?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.266
No, I'm sleeping so good,
I thought I'd try it in the sink.

15:11.433 --> 15:14.400
I guess everybody's
jumpy about the banquet.

15:14.467 --> 15:17.400
Except Blanche.
She could have the good taste

15:17.467 --> 15:19.867
to pretend she can't sleep.

15:19.934 --> 15:22.400
She's probably nervous about
running into Jake.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.500
Sometimes when
people are under pressure,

15:24.567 --> 15:26.200
they sleep to escape.

15:26.266 --> 15:28.100
Dorothy's father used to do that.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.934
Unfortunately,
it was usually during foreplay.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.433
Ma, the man is dead.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.166
Longer than you think.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.834
I feel bad for Blanche.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.000
She's just moped around
since she and Jake broke up.

15:49.066 --> 15:51.333
Don't expect me
to feel sorry for her.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.867
It's not often somebody
special like Jake comes along,

15:54.934 --> 15:56.200
and she throws him away.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.934
What's everybody doing up?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.266
We were talking about how dumb
you were to give up Jake.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.967
I'm still so upset I can't sleep.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.734
Then call him.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.967
I can't do that.

16:09.033 --> 16:11.100
He'd try to persuade me
to see him.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.900
That's out of the question.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.400
What's wrong with Jake?

16:15.467 --> 16:17.533
I think he's wonderful.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
You're miserable without him.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.800
That may be,
but in some ways,

16:21.867 --> 16:24.934
some very important ways,
we're just not compatible.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.033
You mean he's not
good enough for you.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.300
No, I don't.

16:28.367 --> 16:33.734
Our differences would
turn us against each other.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.166
I care too much for him
to let that happen.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.133
You're lucky.
You have a choice.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.600
My marriage was arranged.
I had no say in the matter.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.133
You didn't pick pop?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.834
He didn't pick me, either.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.767
We learned to love each other,
thank God.

16:45.834 --> 16:49.066
But it wasn't our idea.
There were eight unmarried girls

16:49.133 --> 16:51.533
and eight unmarried
boys that spring.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.166
How did they decide
who went with who?

16:53.233 --> 16:54.333
Height.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.700
If I hadn't stood on that rock,

16:58.767 --> 17:00.934
I'd have ended up
with Luigi the pig boy.

17:08.367 --> 17:11.333
If I got a second
chance at Mr. Right,

17:11.400 --> 17:14.700
I'd want someone different
from Charlie.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.667
I thought you were
crazy about him.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.166
I was, I am.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.967
We had a wonderful
life together,

17:21.033 --> 17:24.266
but I'd like somebody really wild,

17:24.333 --> 17:27.967
somebody impulsive
who would sweep me off my feet.

17:28.033 --> 17:30.367
He'd pick me up
in his convertible Porsche

17:30.433 --> 17:32.300
and whisk me to the airport.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.200
We'd fly to his villa
in Southern France

17:35.266 --> 17:38.600
where we'd blindfold the orchestra
and dance until dawn.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.033
Then we'd watch the sun rise
over two steaming cups of cocoa.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.934
Cocoa?

17:48.033 --> 17:49.800
With little marshmallows.

17:51.166 --> 17:54.033
Marshmallows.
Rose, you trollop.

17:57.367 --> 18:00.233
Dorothy, what kind of guy would
you like the second time around?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.867
Somebody to get old with.

18:03.934 --> 18:06.734
-You can do that alone.
-I'm aware of that, Rose.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.433
Stan didn't want to get old.

18:12.500 --> 18:18.166
I'd like someone to sit
on the porch with, hold hands,

18:18.233 --> 18:20.967
listen to the birds,
watch the grass grow.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.433
Blanche,
what kind of man do you want?

18:24.934 --> 18:25.834
I don't know.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.233
You certainly do your share
of comparison shopping.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.500
Come on, Blanche.
What are you looking for?

18:32.567 --> 18:35.333
I don't know.
I just know it's not Jake.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.533
But that won't discourage me
from finding Mr. Right.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.066
I won't compromise
my standards, either.

18:42.133 --> 18:46.266
I'll look high and low,
far and wide, and never lose heart,

18:46.333 --> 18:48.767
for I know one day
my prince will come.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.767
What was that
supposed to mean?

18:51.834 --> 18:53.500
I wasn't paying
close attention.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.900
From what I could tell,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.166
she's going to sleep
with that little black guy, Prince.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.200
Rose, can I speak to you?

19:13.266 --> 19:15.867
Oh, sure.
Excuse me.

19:15.934 --> 19:19.800
Rose, there is something odd
about that all-female jazz band.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.433
-What?
-They're men.

19:21.500 --> 19:26.066
I just thought
they were really ugly women.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.500
-What should we do?
-Nothing. They sound great.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.834
If we're quiet,
maybe no one will notice.

19:31.900 --> 19:35.000
Did you get a load of those queens
on the bandstand?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.133
Keep your voice down.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.834
Why? You think they
don't know they're queens?

19:41.266 --> 19:43.300
I think we're a success.

19:43.367 --> 19:44.967
Congratulations, Blanche.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.000
Much of the credit
goes to the food.

19:47.066 --> 19:50.266
It's original yet familiar,
piquant yet comforting.

19:50.333 --> 19:53.433
Blanche says
she worked closely with the caterer.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.700
And they were
usually naked.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.800
Please excuse my mother.

19:59.867 --> 20:03.033
She was a witness
to the Hindenburg disaster.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.433
I do think Jake
did a wonderful job.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.734
Where is he?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.000
Probably in the kitchen.

20:11.066 --> 20:13.300
There he is by the desserts.

20:13.367 --> 20:16.967
Oh, he looks great in his tux!

20:17.033 --> 20:21.033
Hunter, be a dear and
get me another wine spritzer.

20:21.100 --> 20:21.767
Of course.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.266
-Girls, do me a favor.
-What is it?

20:24.333 --> 20:26.633
Keep Hunter occupied
while I go after Jake.

20:26.700 --> 20:30.200
12 hours ago, you never
wanted to see him again.

20:30.266 --> 20:31.700
I made a mistake.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.600
A terrible, terrible mistake.

20:33.667 --> 20:37.767
What could I have been thinking?

20:37.834 --> 20:40.834
What difference does it make
how he dresses or how he eats?

20:41.667 --> 20:44.633
What matters is
he's the man I love.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.433
Where's Blanche going?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
She went to powder her nose.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.100
At the dessert table?

20:55.166 --> 20:57.934
Well, the powder sticks better

20:58.000 --> 21:00.533
if you put a thin layer
of caramel first.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.900
Hunter, you look skeptical.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.433
Well, hello.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.233
I didn't see you standing there.

21:11.300 --> 21:14.667
I haven't been able to take
my eyes off you.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.000
You look great,
Blanche.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.433
Jake, the reason
I came over here,

21:19.500 --> 21:22.967
I wanted to tell you
I made a mistake.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.633
Our differences
don't really matter.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.100
Blanche, I admire you.
You're a very special woman.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.066
But you didn't make a mistake.
You were right.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.166
Blanche, I'm happy. I like myself.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.533
I want to marry somebody

21:37.600 --> 21:41.233
who's as comfortable with me
as I am with them.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.066
I don't want to wonder if
I'm using the wrong fork at dinner.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.300
Tonight you say our differences
don't matter,

21:49.367 --> 21:52.433
but they did before,
and they will again.

21:52.934 --> 21:56.533
Knowing you has been one of
the best things

21:56.600 --> 21:58.967
that's ever happened to me
in my life.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.867
-Remember that.
-Jake--

22:03.700 --> 22:04.767
Goodbye, Blanche.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.800
Blanche, what happened?

22:12.867 --> 22:16.100
Well, Jake said that,
we have too many differences.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.133
We're not getting back together.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.233
Blanche, I'm so sorry.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.567
I don't understand
how I let this thing happen.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.333
I'm so confused.

22:25.834 --> 22:28.000
Honey, you think
you're confused?

22:28.600 --> 22:30.567
Take a look at our horn section.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.066
Blanche, aren't you going
to try to sleep?

22:48.133 --> 22:49.533
I'm too upset.

22:50.834 --> 22:53.834
Oh, Dorothy, let's face it.
I'm not 16 anymore.

22:53.900 --> 22:59.166
There's no longer a line of beaus
waiting to walk me to town.

22:59.233 --> 23:03.367
No more cotillions,
no more sorority parties.

23:03.433 --> 23:05.266
I've lost the best thing
that's happened to me

23:05.333 --> 23:06.867
since I met George.

23:09.567 --> 23:12.300
I'm just a stupid old fool

23:12.367 --> 23:14.600
sitting up all night
with a broken heart.

23:14.667 --> 23:19.533
Why, Blanche Devereaux,
I cannot believe what I am hearing.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.533
You are the prettiest, most vibrant,
most exciting woman I know.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.066
Men still line up for you.

23:27.867 --> 23:28.967
Really?

23:30.300 --> 23:35.033
Your dance card will be full for the
rest of your life, and you know it.

23:40.100 --> 23:44.767
I don't know whether you meant that
or not, Dorothy, but... thank you.

23:55.233 --> 23:56.700
Damn, I'm good.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.667
(theme music playing)
