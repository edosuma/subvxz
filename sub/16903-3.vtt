Now,remind me,did you just
do the philadelphia cotillion,

00:16.040 --> 00:18.200
or did you also debut internationally?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.360
I'm happy to say that
I don't even get that.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.540
- How was your trip?
- Terrible.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.700
I had to give up my window
seat to some sevenyearold

00:23.700 --> 00:25.660
who had to sit next
to her precious mommy.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.900
What about the actual
purpose of your tr?

00:27.900 --> 00:29.870
How is the search for
the new cast member going?

00:29.870 --> 00:33.390
Okay. I saw a few good alternative
comics in San Francisco.

00:33.390 --> 00:34.880
San Francisco?

00:34.880 --> 00:38.230
I asked you to find an actor
from middle America,a real person.

00:38.230 --> 00:41.410
You're not going to find him in the
people's gaypublic of drugifornia.

00:41.410 --> 00:44.720
Jeez,relax. I'm also setting
up auditions in toronto.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.530
Canada? Why not just go to iraq?

00:47.530 --> 00:50.110
The television audience doesn't
want your elitist east coast,

00:50.110 --> 00:51.730
alternative,intellectual,leftwing...

00:51.730 --> 00:53.770
Jack,just say Jewish.
This is taking forever.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.860
Stop trying to amuse yourself
and start thinking about

00:55.860 --> 00:59.260
what makes actual human beings laugh.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.600
Who wants...

01:00.600 --> 01:02.170
my puddings!

01:05.319 --> 01:07.260
Now that's what I'm talking about.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.610
What a dumb...

01:08.610 --> 01:10.370
oh,no,he's really hurt.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.050
Hey,tracy,did you hear?

01:12.050 --> 01:14.250
Fred dawkins,the
incredibly overweight guy

01:14.250 --> 01:17.040
that pacman was based
on died last night.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.330
I will eat a bowl of cherries

01:18.330 --> 01:20.780
and some ghost meat in his honor.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.390
Orange and black decorations?

01:22.390 --> 01:25.030
Is this halloween or
princeton parents' weekend?

01:25.030 --> 01:27.740
I don't know whether to be
scared or proud of my cousin.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.880
- It's halloween,sir.
- Proud it is.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.520
But this "almost all saints' day"

01:32.520 --> 01:34.160
isn't gonna be much of a celebration.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.200
I just heard that
worldfamous clog dancer

01:36.200 --> 01:39.120
jugbert cody has gone to a better place.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.580
He's in cabo?

01:40.580 --> 01:42.720
No,sir. He passed away.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.140
But at least he died
doing what he loved...

01:45.140 --> 01:47.780
blogging on the huffington post.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.350
Two down,one to go.

01:50.350 --> 01:51.360
What do you mean?

01:51.360 --> 01:52.600
The rule of threes...

01:52.600 --> 01:54.680
celebrities always
die in groups of three.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.030
You better be careful,tray.

01:56.030 --> 01:59.000
Yeah,right. That's not a real thing.

02:05.130 --> 02:08.870
This is gonna be the scariest
princeton parents' weekend ever!

hey,I read your rewrite.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.470
Start over,you hack!

02:37.470 --> 02:38.950
Miss maroney,are you okay?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.300
Oh,I'm fine.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.210
Just reminding the writers who's boss.

02:42.210 --> 02:43.410
With this new actor coming in,

02:43.410 --> 02:45.720
I want to make sure I get taken care of.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.030
I'm not gonna be pushed
aside and forgotten,

02:48.030 --> 02:49.890
like that time at my sister's funeral.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.460
Ma'am,I don't think bullying people

02:51.460 --> 02:53.330
is the way to get them to help you.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.710
This is show business.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.260
Being nice gets you nowhere.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.910
No. Being nice can get you everywhere.

02:59.910 --> 03:03.140
Florence henderson used to bake
cookies for the brady bunch writers.

03:03.140 --> 03:07.520
And,in return,they wrote
her the role of a lifetime,

03:07.520 --> 03:09.840
as her own grandma hutchins.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.960
I don't really remember the brady
bunch,'cause I was too young.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.110
But being nice to the writers...

03:20.110 --> 03:22.370
interesting idea.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.790
Think about it.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.760
Excuse me,Mr. Donaghy.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.450
I wasn't sure if you were participating

03:28.450 --> 03:30.280
in this year's pumpkincarving contest,

03:30.280 --> 03:33.430
or,if like last year,I
should go jump up my own ass.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.170
Same as last year.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.790
Uh,hang on.

03:36.790 --> 03:39.110
Kenneth,you're from georgia,aren't you?

03:39.110 --> 03:40.360
Stone mountain,sir.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.670
Although when the parcells
first came to America,

03:42.670 --> 03:46.270
they lived in a town
called sexcriminalboat.

03:46.270 --> 03:47.810
Do you think that's cherokee?

03:47.810 --> 03:52.160
Uh,no,I mean,you're a middle
American,a Joe average.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.120
You're the only one around here
who knows what ordinary people want.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.100
So tell me... what makes you laugh?

03:59.100 --> 04:01.150
The usual,I suppose.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.750
Two hobos sharing a bean...

04:04.250 --> 04:06.740
lady airline pilots.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.140
I remember,growing up in stone mountain,

04:10.140 --> 04:12.730
my whole family would go
down to the chuckle hut.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.100
That's the local comedy club?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.540
Oh,no,sir. It's a chuckle hut.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.529
You see,the chuckle
is the part of the pig

04:18.529 --> 04:20.829
between the tail and the anus.

04:20.829 --> 04:25.040
But at night,the chuckle hut
becomes the laugh factory,

04:25.040 --> 04:27.610
and that's a comedy club.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.050
Lemon,cancel your trip to toronto.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.720
We're going to stone mountain,georgia.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.780
******

04:38.720 --> 04:41.250
hey,Frank,what is this?

04:41.870 --> 04:44.970
It's an Evite to our halloween party.

04:44.970 --> 04:46.720
I don't want to do that again.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.500
Remember last year?

04:49.760 --> 04:51.910
Hey,I work across the street,

04:51.910 --> 04:54.190
and I saw you guys are
having a halloween party.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.550
Yeah,we are.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.260
Could you close your blinds?

04:57.260 --> 04:59.720
You're really bumming all of us out.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.740
It's humiliating.

05:01.740 --> 05:04.230
Guys,we can't give up on halloween.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.700
It's a magical night where women
dress slutty and drink too much,

05:07.700 --> 05:10.850
where we can hide our
bodies in bulky costumes.

05:10.850 --> 05:12.930
We've got to keep trying.

05:12.930 --> 05:13.930
But we suck.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.830
Yes,but anything can
happen on halloween.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.670
Up is down. Black is white.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.920
Good is evil. And evil... becomes good.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.390
Hey,writers. I baked you cookies.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.900
Jack! You have to help me.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.450
I'm gonna die any minute.

05:32.450 --> 05:34.520
- What are you talking about?
- Celebrities.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.240
They always die in groups of three.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.220
Two already died,and I
might be the next to go.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.370
That's ridiculous.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.830
I got to go somewhere where
nothing will happen to me.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.090
Can you get me on Charlie rose?

05:45.090 --> 05:46.390
Tracy,you have nothing to worry about.

05:46.390 --> 05:48.710
The rule of threes is a
myth that doesn't exist,

05:48.710 --> 05:51.040
like going bald with dignity.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.890
That said,I would prefer
if you take the next one.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.780
So this all started
when their plane crashed?

05:57.780 --> 05:58.900
That's lost.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.430
Oh,right.

06:00.430 --> 06:02.910
You know,I met j. J. Abrams once.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.180
And I don't know what this means,

06:04.180 --> 06:07.000
but he said the Island
is just Hurley's dream.

06:09.150 --> 06:11.100
Why is jenna hanging out with us?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.840
'Cause she's freaking out
about the new cast member.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.530
So she's trying to suck up.

06:15.530 --> 06:16.710
I don't like having her around.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.770
Don't worry. We'll get rid
of her,one prank at a time.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.230
There my buddies are.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.250
Oh,wow,they painted the ceiling in here.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.930
We're going to find the perfect
person for the show down here,

06:30.930 --> 06:33.770
someone who represents the real America.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.580
Jack,for the 80th time,

06:35.580 --> 06:38.820
no part of America is more
American than any other part.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.400
You are wrong.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.590
Small towns are where
you see the kindness

06:42.590 --> 06:45.420
and goodness and courage
of everyday americans...

06:45.420 --> 06:48.010
the folks who are teaching
our kids,running our prisons,

06:48.010 --> 06:49.880
growing our cigarettes...

06:49.880 --> 06:53.060
people who are still living
by core American values.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.360
There are plenty of core
American values in new York.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.900
But there are not restaurants
called fatty fat sandwich ranch.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.740
Turn here. Turn here!

07:04.940 --> 07:06.880
Lemon,if this is going
to play out like lunch,

07:06.880 --> 07:08.350
I suggest you crack your window now

07:08.350 --> 07:11.040
and save yourself the
embarrassment in 20 minutes.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.810
Now,they have hush puppies here,

07:13.810 --> 07:17.390
which you might know better
as a knish or a beignet.

07:17.390 --> 07:18.950
I know what you're trying to do,Jack.

07:18.950 --> 07:21.200
You want to paint me
as this new York snob.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
Can I share with you my world view?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.590
I'd rather hear you
sing rocket man again.

07:25.590 --> 07:28.950
All of humankind has
one thing in common...

07:29.680 --> 07:31.020
the sandwich.

07:31.020 --> 07:34.500
I believe that all anyone
really wants in this life

07:34.500 --> 07:37.240
is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.750
What a surprise... your
world view is foodbased.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.270
And who am I to say that
my delicious Italian sub

07:43.270 --> 07:46.180
is better than its stone
mountain equivalent?

07:46.180 --> 07:51.810
Which is why I will have the
carp po'boy with extra chuckle.

07:56.830 --> 07:57.840
Keep refreshing.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.500
Maybe Andy dick has died
in the last 20 seconds.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.410
Okay,I'll keep looking.

08:02.410 --> 08:06.050
No,I have to take
matters into my own hands.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.670
- Hello?
- Boo!

08:11.670 --> 08:13.340
Who is this?

08:14.280 --> 08:16.080
Hey,Betty,it's t. J.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.500
Tracy!

08:17.500 --> 08:21.020
I haven't seen you since that
rappinggrandma movie we did.

08:21.490 --> 08:24.560
You were so funny as
the rapping grandma.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.010
So how are you feeling?

08:26.010 --> 08:27.640
Any arm pain?

08:27.640 --> 08:28.910
Shortness of breath?

08:28.910 --> 08:31.340
Plans to investigate
corruption in russia?

08:31.340 --> 08:33.150
Wait a minute.

08:33.150 --> 08:38.100
Are you calling because the
pacman guy and jugbert cody died?

08:38.100 --> 08:41.940
- Is this a "rule of threes" call?
- Um,no.

08:41.940 --> 08:46.130
Nice try,jordan,but I am
going to be at your funeral.

08:46.130 --> 08:49.060
I will bury you.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.710
oh,this carp sandwich is not
agreeing with my world view.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.920
Hello,there,folks.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.940
How y'all doing on this fine october...

08:59.940 --> 09:02.970
we have reservations under
donaghy and lemon,and we need keys.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.530
Are y'all from new York?

09:04.530 --> 09:05.860
Yes. How can you tell?

09:05.860 --> 09:10.720
- New York people,always in a real big...
- hurry,yeah.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.250
No,it's not because we're from new York.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.960
We're all the same sandwiches.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.950
You all have a beagle with you?

09:16.950 --> 09:19.000
Just give us our rooms.

09:24.510 --> 09:27.190
Oh,my God.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.390
Tell me about the peach festival.

09:29.390 --> 09:30.920
Oh,peach festival...

09:30.920 --> 09:33.710
they got peach preserves,of course,

09:33.710 --> 09:37.690
peach pie,peach wine,peach jerky...

09:38.230 --> 09:39.670
peach butter...

09:40.510 --> 09:41.740
unbelievable.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.500
I have to apologize.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.060
You know what they should
do with people like her?

09:45.060 --> 09:47.470
They should round them all
up and put them on an Island.

09:47.470 --> 09:49.030
Oh,wait,they already have.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.080
It's called Manhattan.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.920
Down here we call it sexcriminalboat.

09:56.450 --> 09:57.950
Maybe spend some photoshop there.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.430
Hey,Frank.

09:59.430 --> 10:02.220
Do you know
sacha,Michael,and gay Michael?

10:02.220 --> 10:04.120
Can I ask you a question?

10:05.670 --> 10:07.490
Why?

10:10.670 --> 10:13.760
Oh,God,it's bad enough
having jenna hang out here.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.850
Now she's bringing her friends?

10:16.360 --> 10:19.810
How can a dude in a midriff
top dominate me like that?

10:19.810 --> 10:20.900
I like those guys.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.450
I might hang out with them on halloween.

10:22.450 --> 10:23.610
What? Why?

10:23.610 --> 10:25.390
Have you ever been to a gay halloween?

10:25.390 --> 10:26.950
It's amazing.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.910
Last year my girlfriends and
I went to mario cantone's party

10:29.910 --> 10:31.950
in a renovated Barn in chelsea.

10:31.950 --> 10:34.490
So that's where all the
girls are on halloween...

10:34.490 --> 10:37.340
at awesome gaydude parties.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.700
Oh,my God,we go so crazy.

10:39.700 --> 10:43.220
We kiss each other,get
into vans,black out.

10:43.220 --> 10:48.030
I mean,I'm engaged,but not on halloween.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.170
Stop! Stop filling jenna's
wigs with raw shrimp.

10:53.170 --> 10:55.700
- Why?
- We need to pretend to be jenna's friends

10:55.700 --> 10:57.560
for the next 24 hours.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.330
She's our ticket to a gay halloween.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.520
How come when jenna suggests
it,everybody's on board?

11:03.520 --> 11:06.400
No,lutz. Jenna attracts gay guys.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.940
Gay guys throw awesome
halloween parties.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.360
Hot girls go to awesome
halloween parties.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.980
Ergo,if we're jenna's friends...

11:15.980 --> 11:17.440
we spend halloween...

11:17.440 --> 11:18.460
- with hot girls.
- With gay guys...

11:18.460 --> 11:19.940
hot girls.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.610
God,are you doing this to me

11:24.610 --> 11:27.240
'cause I took that blind guy's hot dog?

11:28.760 --> 11:29.840
Who was at the door?

11:29.840 --> 11:33.110
You probably know him as
"hick at the reception desk,"

11:33.450 --> 11:36.070
but his name is travis hoagle,

11:36.070 --> 11:39.480
and,uh,he brought you
something for your stomach.

11:40.860 --> 11:43.640
What is this? "peppy bismilk"?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.930
Why is everything a
little different here?

11:45.930 --> 11:49.380
- I hate it!
- You hate it? You hate travis hoagle...

11:49.380 --> 11:52.770
choir member,desert storm
veteran,father of three?

11:53.610 --> 11:55.310
I made all that up,but you get my point.

11:55.310 --> 11:58.120
Do you even care that
I am not feeling well?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.950
Of course I do.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.850
There,there.

12:03.850 --> 12:06.560
Thank you. That's nice.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.930
Well,I'd love to stay
and do this all night,

12:10.930 --> 12:13.080
but one of us has to
go to the laugh factory.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.870
No,I don't want you going there alone.

12:15.870 --> 12:16.900
Yes,you do.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.280
The people here... they're the
audience we're trying to reach.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.350
I get them. I know what they want.

12:21.350 --> 12:23.640
I'm gonna find somebody great tonight.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.450
Hey,Rick,what's the difference
between your girlfriend and your truck?

12:29.450 --> 12:31.250
I don't know,pumpkin.
What is the difference?

12:31.250 --> 12:35.030
Your truck don't yell at
you every time you get gas.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.710
Wonderful. Bravo

12:45.810 --> 12:48.670
hey... actor friend.

12:48.670 --> 12:52.210
So what are we all doing
together for halloween?

12:52.210 --> 12:56.330
Oh,well,sacha and the
michaels usually have a party.

12:56.330 --> 13:00.760
Oh,'cause lutz and toof
and I always have a party.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.670
Hang on.

13:02.670 --> 13:05.210
What if we combined parties,

13:05.210 --> 13:07.340
threw one big party here in the studio?

13:07.340 --> 13:10.630
- Is that crazy?
- No. Let's do that.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.300
Yes.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.800
That gesture.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.020
I like people who do that.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.310
A party with them?

13:21.310 --> 13:23.210
Oh,don't look at me
like I'm a football game.

13:23.210 --> 13:25.120
I need those guys.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.480
I've been using them to make sure

13:26.480 --> 13:28.980
I'm taken care of when
the new actor gets here.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.350
Girl,I don't even have
the energy to tell you

13:31.350 --> 13:35.140
what's happening here,so read my face.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.320
Oh,my God!

13:38.320 --> 13:40.510
They're using me to get
invited to gay halloween

13:40.510 --> 13:42.440
so they can meet hot girls.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.810
In metro news,Mary Hillman is
going to gaffney for the weekend

13:45.810 --> 13:49.230
and hopes that Martha or
stephanie will water her plants.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.420
And now an update on...

13:50.420 --> 13:52.190
very small town.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.480
Morning,lemon. I
brought you a ginger ale.

14:02.890 --> 14:04.780
"Schwupps ginny pale"?

14:04.780 --> 14:06.250
This place is the worst.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.910
Don't worry. We're leaving.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.560
Our work here is done.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.570
In entertainment news, local
funnymanand subshop owner Rick Wayne

14:13.570 --> 14:15.610
has been hired by a catholic

14:15.610 --> 14:18.730
to appear on tgs with a black fella.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.370
- What?
- Hear me out.

14:20.370 --> 14:23.120
We're hiring Rick Wayne and pumpkin.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.570
It's a ventriloquist act.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.630
Oh,I'm too sick to handle this.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.950
See,you think you're not this
prejudiced,arrogant new yorker,

14:28.950 --> 14:30.750
but you are,because in your mind,

14:30.750 --> 14:33.040
a southern ventriloquist
act can't be funny.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.860
But you know who does think it's funny?

14:34.860 --> 14:37.730
These people... these
wonderful,folksy,simple...

14:37.730 --> 14:39.790
stop calling them simple.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.750
You know what? You're the prejudice one.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.780
Sure,some of these people are simple,

14:43.780 --> 14:46.250
but some of them are
smart,like matlock...

14:46.250 --> 14:48.230
or wholesome,like elly mae clampett.

14:48.230 --> 14:52.080
And some of them are skeevy dirt
bags like the dukes of hazzard,

14:52.080 --> 14:53.880
driving around like maniacs.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.700
Children use those roads.

14:55.700 --> 14:59.010
My point is americans
are the same everywhere

14:59.010 --> 15:01.220
in that we are all different.

15:01.220 --> 15:02.240
You're wrong,lemon.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.820
These people are better,purer.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.070
Do you know what I did this morning?

15:06.070 --> 15:09.090
I assisted in the birth of a foal.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.580
They named it Jack.

15:12.230 --> 15:14.230
And it was delicious.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.130
I know what I'm doing here,lemon.

15:16.130 --> 15:18.050
We're hiring Rick and pumpkin.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.990
We're not hiring
anyone until I see them.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.020
Good God,lemon,your breath.

15:23.020 --> 15:26.820
When did you find time to eat a
diaper that you found on the beach?

15:30.570 --> 15:33.750
Hi,I'm trying to get
to studio 6b from here.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.270
I'm still finding my way around.

15:35.270 --> 15:36.550
You look clean.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.130
You a celebrity?

15:38.130 --> 15:40.430
I have my own show on NBC.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.000
No. Celebrity.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.990
I was in a movie with
queen latifah once.

15:45.990 --> 15:47.220
Perfect.

15:47.220 --> 15:48.920
I'll show you the shortcut.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.900
Okay,you're sure this is the right way?

15:52.900 --> 15:54.910
Yes,queen latifah's friend.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.850
I'm sure.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.000
Mr. Jordan!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.500
Are you trying to kill Mr.
Fallon with that hammer?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.180
What the hell?

16:05.180 --> 16:07.450
Is this a "rule of threes" thing?

16:07.450 --> 16:09.060
Not cool,guy.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.240
I'm sorry,Ken.

16:12.540 --> 16:13.750
But I want to live.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.000
Mr. Jordan,you're going to be fine.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.910
There is no rule of threes.

16:18.930 --> 16:22.520
- Iook out!
- Okay,okay,truce. Truce,okay?

16:22.520 --> 16:24.630
But if some celebrity doesn't die soon,

16:24.630 --> 16:26.830
I'm gonna kill my first guest tonight.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.990
It's a dog who plays soccer.

16:28.990 --> 16:31.320
Really? That's your first guest?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.020
Yeah.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.760
Pete,I'm not gonna let this happen.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.160
But what can you do?

16:38.590 --> 16:41.270
Well,Jack says I'm just
an obnoxious new yorker,

16:41.270 --> 16:43.220
so that's what Rick Wayne
is gonna get tonight.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.830
And it's gonna get ugly.

16:44.830 --> 16:45.980
What are you...

16:45.980 --> 16:47.550
oh,my God,you're gonna heckle him,

16:47.550 --> 16:49.340
like that time I invited
you to see my cover band.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.360
Yeah,and today the world is better off

16:51.360 --> 16:55.530
without the Pete hornberger
Alan Parsons project project.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.630
I may be dehydrated.

16:57.630 --> 16:59.450
I may still be working a little chuckle

16:59.450 --> 17:01.120
out of my system,but don't worry.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.600
When I'm done,the last
thing Rick Wayne and pumpkin

17:03.600 --> 17:06.140
are gonna want to do
is come to new York.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.869
You guys,I am so excited.

17:07.869 --> 17:09.890
I already put on my costume.

17:09.890 --> 17:12.410
Get it? I'm an Italian senator.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.420
Don't you love it?
It's gonna be awesome.

17:19.420 --> 17:23.109
And with one word,I
can make it all go away.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.310
Wait,wwhat are you talking about?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.480
Oh,cut the crap.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.810
You boys are just pretending to
like me to get in on gay halloween.

17:28.810 --> 17:31.120
Okay. What do you want?

17:31.120 --> 17:33.020
I want two good sketches a week,

17:33.020 --> 17:35.210
a promise to hate the new cast member,

17:35.210 --> 17:36.380
and no more making fun of me

17:36.380 --> 17:38.520
when I misuse dated cultural references.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.570
Okay? Are we cowabunga on this?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.900
- Fine,we're... we're cowabunga.
- Good.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.590
But if I wake up in any of your
apartments tomorrow morning,

17:47.980 --> 17:50.580
you will buy me breakfast.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.700
All right,the last pig
is in the chuckling chute.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.040
And we're now the laugh factory.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.600
We got a great show for y'all tonight,

18:02.600 --> 18:04.780
and we're gonna get right to it

18:04.780 --> 18:09.030
with stone mountain's own
Rick Wayne and pumpkin.

18:12.940 --> 18:16.250
All right,you asked for it.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.000
- Good evening,everyone.
- How y'all doing?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.360
Hey,this your first time doing this?

18:21.360 --> 18:23.470
I'm sorry,I didn't know it was filthy,

18:23.470 --> 18:26.210
thinlipped hooker night
here at the laugh factory.

18:26.210 --> 18:28.590
Okay. I underestimated you.

18:28.590 --> 18:30.240
Knock,knock. Who's there,pumpkin?

18:30.240 --> 18:32.550
A ferretfaced skank.

18:32.550 --> 18:34.340
Yep,I see her too.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.110
Get a job,hayseed.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.260
Are you still talking?

18:37.260 --> 18:39.080
You are one mouthy bitch.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.630
I don't go down to where you work
and stop them from milking you.

18:42.630 --> 18:45.210
I'm sorry,but that's enough,sir.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.330
You're out of line.

18:46.330 --> 18:47.560
I'll tell you what's out of line.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.140
Your old lady's knockers.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.240
Good lord,woman. I
wouldn't you with elmo's.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.600
Rick,pumpkin,what are you doing?

18:55.600 --> 18:59.110
A gentleman,whether he's human
or somehow more than human,

18:59.110 --> 19:01.150
does not speak to a lady like that.

19:01.150 --> 19:03.040
You two are wholesome and decent.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.890
Oh,I get it. You think 'cause we talk
like this,we're all simple and quaint.

19:06.890 --> 19:11.390
Well,I'm an amateur astronomer,and
Rick's black wife speaks French.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.210
Her name's jamilla.

19:13.210 --> 19:16.130
See,I told you. There's
no "real America.

19:16.130 --> 19:19.790
" You shut that dog
rectum you call a mouth?

19:20.940 --> 19:22.240
Yes,sir.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.810
Why are you people laughing at this?

19:24.810 --> 19:27.540
You're supposed to be
better,nicer,but you're terrible.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.660
You're all terrible,just
like the people in new York.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.980
All God's children are terrible.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.920
Terrible,huh? I got a
question for you there,pal.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.820
Do you ever find smaller
heads orbiting your head?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.420
Is that a comment about
the size of my head?

19:45.420 --> 19:48.080
I'm a tall man,and it's
proportional to my frame.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.460
Your frame? What are they
building there... a super walmart?

19:54.230 --> 19:55.610
You come down here and say that.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.940
I can't. I got a man's arm stuck up me.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.740
But you know what that's like.

20:06.860 --> 20:12.860
I can't believe I bought a
fatty fat sandwich franchise!

20:12.860 --> 20:14.870
Oh,God,he's murdering me. His
head is so much bigger up close!

20:20.270 --> 20:21.890
The deal's off,Wayne.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.100
Lemon,to the kia sorrento!
