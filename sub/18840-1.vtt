00:54.355 --> 00:56.725
Thanks.

01:00.462 --> 01:02.430
Thank you.

01:26.020 --> 01:30.158
I can remember riding around on the back
of my mother's bicycle in her little seat...

01:30.291 --> 01:32.494
the basket seat on the back...

01:32.627 --> 01:35.830
because we were celebrating
the end of World War II...

01:35.964 --> 01:38.433
because we, the Americans...

01:38.566 --> 01:42.504
had dropped the bombs
on the Japs in Hiroshima...

01:42.637 --> 01:47.108
and we were celebrating because
my mother's brothers, Tinky and John...

01:49.210 --> 01:51.112
were coming home from the war.

01:51.246 --> 01:55.150
Maybe I should just tell you
some of the facts as I remember them.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.754
I grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island...

01:59.888 --> 02:03.191
in a clapboard house.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.260
At the time I was a child...

02:05.393 --> 02:08.630
I guess I was told
that it was 75 years old.

02:08.763 --> 02:11.633
It had a well —
a bucket well...

02:11.766 --> 02:14.402
and an artesian well —
two wells.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.404
A well you could drop
a bucket down into...

02:16.538 --> 02:19.140
and hoist it up and drink
fresh water in the summer.

02:19.274 --> 02:22.477
It had a barn,
which we kept garden tools in...

02:22.610 --> 02:24.479
and cars as well — two cars.

02:24.612 --> 02:28.016
And an attic upstairs
and a cellar in the barn.

02:28.149 --> 02:31.186
A lovely garden
that my grandfather and father...

02:31.319 --> 02:33.655
grew everything in...

02:33.788 --> 02:36.391
including peanuts, Swiss chard.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.963
My Grandmother Gray,
my father's mother, lived with us.

02:42.096 --> 02:45.133
I was the middle of three boys...

02:45.266 --> 02:47.669
so my parents had three sons.

02:47.802 --> 02:50.038
And so I got a little kitten, Mittens.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.975
I called it Mittens 'cause it had
those little white, you know, paws.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.811
And so this Mittens...

02:56.945 --> 02:59.914
I hadn't had it very long
before it was killed by Mrs. Adams...

03:00.048 --> 03:02.450
driving a large
black Chrysler at dusk...

03:02.584 --> 03:05.687
on Rumstick Road.

03:05.820 --> 03:08.060
Mrs. Adams was a very big woman.
She had two daughters...

03:08.089 --> 03:10.225
that my brothers and I called
"piggy big sisters."

03:12.360 --> 03:15.830
They were very big,
and they looked like pigs.
That's the most I can remember of them.

03:15.964 --> 03:18.566
And Mrs. Adams was mortified.
She realized what she'd done.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.668
She stopped the car
and she chased me, and I ran.

03:20.802 --> 03:24.706
I couldn't face her.
I couldn't breathe. I was so —

03:24.839 --> 03:27.519
I couldn't catch my breath,
and I ran to my room, and she chased me.

03:27.609 --> 03:29.744
I think she made it
as far as the front door...

03:29.878 --> 03:33.548
and my mother, I suppose, stopped her
and talked with her, but she never got to me.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.684
I went and locked myself in my room.
I was catatonic. Couldn't catch my breath.

03:36.818 --> 03:39.454
Something like my brother actually couldn't —
He'd go through that too —

03:39.587 --> 03:41.456
extreme anxieties — my older brother.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.125
We were sleeping in the same bedroom,
and I'd wake up in the middle of the night...

03:44.259 --> 03:47.328
and he'd be holding his throat,
blue in the face...

03:47.462 --> 03:50.198
telling my mother and father he was dying
because he couldn't breathe, you see?

03:50.331 --> 03:52.634
And they'd be sitting at the edge
of the bed, trying to calm him down.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.703
He was standing on the bed.
Finally, they would calm him down...

03:55.837 --> 03:58.273
and my father would go to bed,
and my mother would stay with him...

03:58.406 --> 04:01.576
and she'd turn out the lights
and sit on the edge of his bed...

04:01.709 --> 04:04.212
and we would look up at the ceiling,
which the only light...

04:04.345 --> 04:06.514
was these fluorescent decals
of the stars —

04:06.648 --> 04:09.617
the Big Dipper, a new moon, Saturn.

04:10.952 --> 04:14.255
And my brother would start in.
He'd say...

04:14.389 --> 04:18.392
"Mom, when I die, is it forever?"

04:19.726 --> 04:23.464
She'd go, "Yes, dear."

04:23.598 --> 04:26.501
He'd go, "Mom, when I die...

04:26.634 --> 04:28.403
is it forever and ever?"

04:28.536 --> 04:32.140
She'd go, "Mm-hmm, dear."

04:32.273 --> 04:35.176
Then he'd go, "Mom...

04:35.310 --> 04:39.113
when I die,
is it forever and ever...

04:39.247 --> 04:41.349
and ever and ever?"

04:41.482 --> 04:44.218
She'd go, "Mm."

04:44.352 --> 04:46.821
And I'd just fall asleep to this.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.829
It would put me right out,
and he would always get upset with me...

04:54.963 --> 04:57.565
for being the calm one, you see?

04:57.699 --> 04:59.968
Well, there were two extreme
nervous breakdowns...

05:00.101 --> 05:04.405
and probably a lot of nervous
"in between" that she had...

05:04.539 --> 05:08.676
and the first one was
when I was I think ten years old.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.778
And it was in the summer...

05:10.912 --> 05:15.083
and, uh, it was —

05:16.150 --> 05:19.887
She was just very nervous
and pulling at her hair...

05:20.021 --> 05:22.557
and unable to concentrate
and talking to herself.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.126
And so she was —

05:25.259 --> 05:29.163
Then I think at that time, she was sent away
to a Christian Science nursing home.

05:29.297 --> 05:33.434
I tell you, the most difficult thing
about it for me was that...

05:33.568 --> 05:35.503
the denial that was going on
around the house.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.506
My Grandmother Gray lived with us
at the time — my father's mother —

05:38.639 --> 05:41.109
and no one was ever coming...

05:41.242 --> 05:44.946
to me or my brothers...

05:45.079 --> 05:48.149
and saying... talking about it.

05:48.282 --> 05:51.152
So that I'd be in the playroom
with my friends in the summer...

05:51.285 --> 05:53.421
and all of a sudden I'd hear Mom...

05:53.554 --> 05:57.892
shrieking in the — in the kitchen...

05:58.026 --> 05:59.827
crying out to Jesus and going...

05:59.961 --> 06:02.130
"Oh, Rock! Oh, no! Oh!"
you know...

06:02.263 --> 06:04.532
just in distress,
like she's being attacked.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.503
I can remember pausing,
and my friends would be afraid.

06:08.636 --> 06:12.173
We'd all be afraid and be looking
at each other, and no one would say...

06:12.306 --> 06:14.242
<i>"Was that your mother?"
or "What was that?"</i>

06:14.375 --> 06:16.677
<i>It was like a ghost.</i>

06:16.811 --> 06:19.480
I think that some people
are born people...

06:19.614 --> 06:22.216
and they grow up as people and then
they decide to become professionals...

06:22.350 --> 06:24.052
'cause they have
to make a living, right?

06:24.185 --> 06:26.654
And they become a dentist, doctor
or lawyer, whatever it is they study for...

06:26.788 --> 06:30.691
and then they go through life as that,
and then they die, and that's that.

06:30.825 --> 06:34.829
You know, even some people study acting.
They become actors through studying acting.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.798
Other people are born actors.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.600
It's an ontological condition.
There's no way out.

06:39.734 --> 06:43.805
They are simply acting out all the time,
you know? And I think I was in that state.

06:43.938 --> 06:46.240
For instance, I was 12 years old...

06:46.374 --> 06:49.944
and some fireworks would go off,
just a whole package of lady fingers outside.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.647
And I'd take the cue
and rush to the window...

06:52.780 --> 06:55.149
and go, "Mom! Mom, come quick!

06:55.283 --> 06:59.253
Russ Russell, our neighbor,
is up on his roof shooting his children!"

07:02.623 --> 07:05.293
And that was before that happened
so often, you know?

07:05.426 --> 07:08.162
In the old days.
It wasn't a common occurrence.

07:08.296 --> 07:10.976
And my mother would buy right into it.
She'd rush over going, "What?

07:11.065 --> 07:14.502
Oh! Oh! Oh —
No, no.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.571
Oh, Spuddy dear, no."

07:16.704 --> 07:19.640
She would be...

07:19.774 --> 07:23.578
well, very, very forthcoming,
and helping me with my spelling words...

07:23.711 --> 07:25.680
and taking me on my paper route...

07:25.813 --> 07:28.483
and telling me intimate stories...

07:28.616 --> 07:33.121
about her relationship to my father
that I probably shouldn't have heard.

07:33.254 --> 07:36.691
And then all of a sudden one day
when I was 14...

07:36.824 --> 07:41.562
and had failed seventh grade
and tried to knock myself out.

07:42.330 --> 07:46.000
We used to take 20 deep breaths
after a hot bath...

07:46.134 --> 07:48.369
and blow on your thumb.

07:48.503 --> 07:51.172
What was I doing?
I don't know. Some crazy thing.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.345
And I got knocked out,
and when I came to, my arm...

07:53.441 --> 07:55.843
this arm, was against the radiator...

07:55.977 --> 07:59.881
and I had a third-degree burn —
it looked like rare roast beef—

08:00.014 --> 08:02.250
and it was a miracle
I was still alive...

08:02.383 --> 08:05.486
that I didn't break a blood vessel
in my head or just, you know.

08:05.620 --> 08:08.289
And my parents were downstairs
watching television —

08:08.422 --> 08:10.791
<i>Gunsmoke,</i> I remember —
in the playroom.

08:10.925 --> 08:15.096
And I walked down, shaking all over
with this incredible burn...

08:15.229 --> 08:17.098
and my mother
looked at it and went...

08:17.231 --> 08:20.301
"Oh, put some soap on it, dear,
and know the truth" —

08:20.434 --> 08:22.703
the truth being that there is no...

08:22.837 --> 08:25.606
pain or suffering in God's world,
there's no imperfection.

08:25.740 --> 08:29.677
That is enormous distance, you see?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.613
That's what I mean
by "alternating current."

08:32.746 --> 08:35.683
Any mother,
I don't care what religion she's in...

08:35.816 --> 08:39.953
would, I would think —
Intuition would be to fly to that child.

08:40.087 --> 08:45.326
But for her, it would represent
acknowledging the condition.

08:45.459 --> 08:49.697
She really believed in the power of mind.
Our pipes used to freeze in a bathroom...

08:49.830 --> 08:53.100
from the wind off Narragansett Bay,
which is very ice-cold in February...

08:53.234 --> 08:57.071
and she was sure that the wind
was caused by the disturbed thinking...

08:57.205 --> 08:59.207
of the Red Chinese
in Communist China.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.209
You see?

09:01.342 --> 09:04.912
And she told me that Mary Baker Eddy
said there was a man who was so afraid...

09:05.046 --> 09:08.282
when he was on the operating table,
he was sweating, he thought it was blood...

09:08.416 --> 09:10.284
and he died of fear, you see?

09:10.418 --> 09:13.888
So we were always afraid of being afraid.
It was never-ending.

09:14.021 --> 09:19.827
My father, he said,
"Why don't we go play golf together?"

09:19.961 --> 09:22.797
Now, we had never played golf together.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.966
We never even joined the country club.

09:25.099 --> 09:27.301
My uncle said there were two kinds of people
in Barrington, Rhode Island —

09:27.435 --> 09:30.504
those who belong and those who don't —
to the Rhode Island Country Club.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.173
We didn't belong.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.706
Later, my Grandmother Gray
told me that my father's father...

09:34.809 --> 09:37.378
told him the facts of life
on a golf course...

09:37.511 --> 09:39.880
so this is where my father
got the idea from.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.984
So we went out —
We had to go to a public course...

09:43.117 --> 09:47.521
in Seekonk, Massachusetts,
called Wampanoag.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.424
Now, mainly when it rained,
it was underwater...

09:50.558 --> 09:52.526
so we called it Swampanoag.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.829
So we get out there.
I think we were on the fourth hole...

09:54.962 --> 09:57.865
and my father went...

09:57.999 --> 10:00.034
"You know" —
This just came out of nowhere.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.838
He said, "There's a gal in our plant."

10:03.971 --> 10:07.308
He worked in a factory. He called it a plant.
It was a very conservative factory...

10:07.441 --> 10:11.412
where they made screw machines,
machines that made screws...

10:11.545 --> 10:15.883
and they didn't even allow Coca-Cola
in this plant until a few years ago.

10:16.017 --> 10:18.853
And he said,
"There's a gal in our plant...

10:18.986 --> 10:22.023
who has a turkey in the oven...

10:22.156 --> 10:24.525
and she won't admit to it."

10:30.331 --> 10:34.201
"It's, uh — It's as plain
as the nose on her face.

10:34.335 --> 10:37.905
She won't admit to it because
she doesn't have a man. She's not married...

10:38.039 --> 10:40.941
and she keeps coming to work
because she has no one to support her.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.011
People are saying,
'Why don't you go have the turkey...

10:44.145 --> 10:46.814
and come back when you're through?'
But she —"

10:46.947 --> 10:49.250
"Now, you wouldn't want
to get a gal...

10:49.383 --> 10:51.886
in a situation like that, would you?"

10:52.019 --> 10:55.022
And I said,
"Well, I guess not. No. No."

10:55.156 --> 10:57.858
And then there was a pause.
We were kind of going with our clubs...

10:57.992 --> 11:01.329
and walking and putting,
and he said...

11:01.462 --> 11:05.132
"Um, you know, there are diseases
that can make you blind."

11:07.034 --> 11:10.338
Now, I didn't know what he was
talking about then. I didn't know.

11:10.471 --> 11:12.573
I was a little paranoid then,
and I thought...

11:12.707 --> 11:15.176
"Oh, Jeannie Lamb's mother
has found out.

11:15.309 --> 11:18.112
She's told Dad to take me
out on the golf course and say...

11:18.245 --> 11:22.083
'Tell your son that if he fucks
my daughter, he'll go blind.'"

11:22.216 --> 11:24.816
- We played golf out on the —
- We did. That's right.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.655
Wampanoag Trail, the public course.

11:27.788 --> 11:31.525
And in fact, that's where you first
attempted to tell me the facts of life.

11:31.659 --> 11:33.761
- Was it?
- Yeah.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.597
- We were out to the fourth hole.
- On the fourth hole?

11:36.731 --> 11:39.834
And you told me about a woman
that got pregnant at Brown & Sharpe —

11:39.967 --> 11:42.303
- On the fourth hole?
- Yeah.

11:42.436 --> 11:46.240
I don't think you said she had a turkey in
the oven, but you might have. I don't know.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.614
Would that be something you'd say?
Or did I make that up?

11:48.743 --> 11:50.945
Sometimes I don't know
when I'm fictionalizing or not.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.248
I sometimes don't know
whether you are either, but —

11:54.382 --> 11:57.385
My Uncle Tinky
introduced me to wine.

11:58.953 --> 12:00.888
His name was Ted.
We called him Tinky. I don't know why.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.992
But he brought wine — two bottles
of Great Western sparkling Burgundy...

12:05.126 --> 12:08.729
every Thanksgiving and Christmas —
to my grandmother's house.

12:08.863 --> 12:12.066
Now, I sat next to my Grandmother Gray,
and she didn't like sparkling Burgundy...

12:12.199 --> 12:16.203
so I got two glasses, which means
I was twice-over happy twice a year.

12:16.337 --> 12:18.339
I was happy
on Thanksgiving and Christmas.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.575
The rest of the year was mainly waiting
for the sparkling Burgundy.

12:22.543 --> 12:26.680
And I told my friend Duke Watts, I said,
"This wine is good.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.583
Wine is a good thing.
We must find it."

12:32.520 --> 12:34.955
"To have it more days of the year."

12:35.089 --> 12:37.191
The way we would do it,
we discovered a plan —

12:37.324 --> 12:39.293
he had his drivers' license,
I didn't have mine yet —

12:39.427 --> 12:41.929
was to drive down toward Newport,
the naval base...

12:42.062 --> 12:45.222
but not go over the Mount Hope Bridge,
because we didn't want to pay the dollar.

12:45.266 --> 12:48.702
It was owned by Haffenreffer,
and he was charging a dollar to go over
and a dollar to come back.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.939
We would turn around right at the bridge
and head back and pick up sailors.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.676
So we would go, and they would say,
"All right, what do you want?"

12:55.810 --> 12:58.579
And we always wanted to say to them,
"We would like two bottles...

12:58.712 --> 13:01.449
of Great Western sparkling Burgundy."

13:01.582 --> 13:03.451
But we were afraid to.
I don't know why.

13:03.584 --> 13:06.020
We were afraid that the sailors
would think we were —

13:10.224 --> 13:13.093
So they'd say, "What do you want?"
you know?

13:13.227 --> 13:15.896
And we'd say, "We want wine."
"Well, what kind?"

13:16.030 --> 13:17.932
"Red wine," we'd say,
'cause we didn't know the kinds.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.502
And they'd always come out
with a quart bottle of Petri port.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.438
Which we started to like.
It was sweeter.

13:24.572 --> 13:27.641
It was 20 percent alcohol,
although it didn't have the little bubbles.

13:27.775 --> 13:30.845
And so we were having —

13:30.978 --> 13:33.818
We liked drinking in the afternoons,
when our energy was at the highest.

13:33.848 --> 13:38.619
We called these afternoon
drinking sessions "luncheons."

13:38.752 --> 13:42.156
That was our code word so my parents
wouldn't know what was going on.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.226
And a typical luncheon
would be a bottle of Petri port...

13:45.359 --> 13:48.762
and we would listen to Sidney Bechet
full blast on Duke Watts's record player...

13:48.896 --> 13:51.866
and then jump out his second-story
window after we got drunk, land...

13:51.999 --> 13:55.569
come around, come back upstairs, drink
some more, jump out the window, land...

13:55.703 --> 13:58.138
while the music was playing,
just letting off steam.

13:58.272 --> 14:02.343
I was failing everything, and I got sent away
to school, to Fryeburg Academy...

14:02.476 --> 14:06.046
and I thought I would try out
for the junior play.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.784
And not only was I dyslexic, but I was
so nervous I couldn't hold a book.

14:10.918 --> 14:14.288
I was...

14:14.421 --> 14:17.091
So I didn't get the role.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.960
So my senior year, they did
<i>The Curious Savage</i> as the class play...

14:20.094 --> 14:23.297
and I said, "By God,
I'm gonna try out the way I read...

14:23.430 --> 14:25.666
and I'm gonna hold the book down
so it won't move"...

14:25.799 --> 14:27.835
and I just read it
the only way I could read it.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.738
"Cheese, eggs, milk, meat. Ha, ha.

14:30.871 --> 14:34.275
I drink about four pints
of milk a day—

14:34.408 --> 14:36.310
Channel Island milk— ha, ha —

14:36.443 --> 14:39.446
and eat about a pound of steak."

14:39.580 --> 14:42.116
And I got the role...

14:42.249 --> 14:44.618
because it took place
in an insane asylum.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.622
They thought
I was perfect for the role...

14:50.190 --> 14:52.126
of the man
who thinks he's Hannibal.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.629
He's deluded. He has delusions of grandeur,
and he thinks not only is he Hannibal...

14:55.763 --> 14:58.499
that he can play the violin — And at the end
of the play, everyone's fantasy comes true.

14:58.632 --> 15:03.270
They put on violin music, and I'm —
sawing away.

15:03.404 --> 15:07.274
Now, opening night — and of course we only
played two nights at Fryeburg Academy—

15:07.408 --> 15:10.678
but opening night, there was a carpet
down there, you know, with squares on it.

15:10.811 --> 15:14.682
It wasn't at rehearsal. And I remember
I had to do a downstage left cross...

15:14.815 --> 15:18.185
and I improvised a hopscotch,
in character, on the squares.

15:18.319 --> 15:21.255
And the entire audience laughed.

15:22.323 --> 15:24.825
Like that.
Only everyone, complete.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.862
And I was hooked.
I was hooked.

15:28.996 --> 15:32.499
It went through me like a "thoop!"
Like a "whoo!" Like a you-know-what.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.302
And I didn't want to do anything else.

15:35.436 --> 15:39.607
There was nothing else I wanted to do
before that, so this was a novelty.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.744
I remember that a very important thing
happened in that <i>Curious Savage.</i>

15:43.877 --> 15:46.680
The stage manager kept trying
to give me my lines...

15:46.814 --> 15:50.451
because my timing —
they didn't appreciate my timing.

15:50.584 --> 15:54.054
And Ruth Hartz— I remember
Mrs. Hartz, the director, said...

15:54.188 --> 15:57.091
"Don't ever give Spud a cue.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.393
Don't ever give him his line
unless he asks for it...

15:59.526 --> 16:01.962
because he has excellent timing."

16:02.096 --> 16:04.698
And that's the first time
anyone had said...

16:04.832 --> 16:07.101
the word "excellent"
in relationship to anything I did.

16:07.234 --> 16:11.271
<i>And to say it around timing —
well, that's everything, isn't it?</i>

16:32.393 --> 16:34.828
I was a virgin when I entered college.

16:37.798 --> 16:39.667
And I was at a party...

16:39.800 --> 16:42.369
and my friend Randy
came up to me and said...

16:42.503 --> 16:44.371
"You see that girl?

16:44.505 --> 16:46.573
Her name's Pam,
and she goes down."

16:51.912 --> 16:55.182
"And I'm going to go down with her
before the night's over."

16:57.451 --> 16:59.987
And I thought I'd try to beat him out,
and I went up and said...

17:00.120 --> 17:02.890
"Hi, Pam. My name's Spud,
and I hear you go down."

17:10.064 --> 17:11.999
And we spent the night together.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.904
I began by licking her breasts.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.173
She said, "What do you think I am,
your mother?"

17:26.914 --> 17:28.849
Um...

17:30.017 --> 17:33.120
then we had intercourse.

17:42.463 --> 17:45.099
And I came in about 30 seconds...

17:45.232 --> 17:49.169
and I ended up lying there for the rest
of the night, staring at the ceiling.

17:49.303 --> 17:51.505
And I have to tell you
I was a little anxious...

17:51.638 --> 17:53.974
because my bed
was right by the window.

17:54.108 --> 17:57.778
I kept rearranging the bed, but the room
was so small that no matter where I put it...

17:57.911 --> 18:00.781
it was basically by the window.

18:00.914 --> 18:05.786
Why was it upsetting for me? Because
I was reading Freud for the first time...

18:05.919 --> 18:09.022
and I read that Freud
had discovered an unconscious.

18:09.156 --> 18:12.459
I don't remember how, but he had.

18:12.593 --> 18:17.197
And this was a shock for me, because
up until then, I thought I was here.

18:21.802 --> 18:25.305
I didn't know there was a whole part
of me missing. I didn't know...

18:25.439 --> 18:28.008
there was this "un"...

18:28.142 --> 18:31.245
which, if you don't know how big it is,
could go on forever. It could be huge.

18:31.378 --> 18:36.116
And I thought it was housing all the
self-destructive shadow aspects of myself...

18:36.250 --> 18:38.218
and that if I went to sleep
by that window...

18:38.352 --> 18:40.320
the "un" would take over
my body in the night...

18:40.454 --> 18:42.422
and jump out the window with it.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.892
And halfway down,
the conscious self, waking up...

18:45.025 --> 18:47.528
would be desperately
grasping at the bricks.

18:47.661 --> 18:51.832
Now, this upset me so much
that I transferred
to Emerson College down the road.

18:52.933 --> 18:56.703
But you know what I was
curious about was that...

18:56.837 --> 19:00.808
what you thought about when I first starting
going into acting at Emerson College.

19:00.941 --> 19:03.777
- I thought you were absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.

19:03.911 --> 19:06.547
How anybody could make
a living in the theater...

19:06.680 --> 19:10.751
particularly one that was a shy,
backwards sort of young fellow —

19:10.884 --> 19:12.886
I just knew you couldn't do it.

19:13.020 --> 19:16.356
<i>Long Day's Journey Into Night.</i>
This was a role I really got into.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.592
I was playing Edmund,
the O'Neill role.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.794
I was drinking whiskey, Irish whiskey.

19:20.928 --> 19:23.297
I was suffering.
I was reading the O'Neill biography.

19:23.430 --> 19:27.034
I was living in a big Victorian house.
It was Theatre by the Sea,
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.536
Tugboats out there.
Perfect sound effects.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.072
Me drinking the whiskey
and refusing to turn up the heat...

19:32.206 --> 19:34.708
in this very cold Victorian house
with a widow's walk...

19:34.842 --> 19:38.912
and the owner of the house who's renting me
this room is saying, "Please, please.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.548
I'll lower the rent
if you turn up the heat."

19:41.682 --> 19:44.318
And I wouldn't do it. And the pipes
were bursting, and he was down there.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.688
He had such a beautiful disposition.
It was unbelievable what I put him through.

19:47.821 --> 19:50.621
There was ice on the toilet in the morning.
I had to pee on top of ice.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.461
There was a sheet of ice there. And we
were playing this thing four hours long...

19:54.595 --> 19:58.765
to seven people in subzero weather
at this warehouse on a Sunday night.

19:58.899 --> 20:01.768
Seven people in the audience.
And my brother had been in Chile.

20:01.902 --> 20:05.239
Rocky had been in Chile for three years,
and he came back to see me.

20:05.372 --> 20:09.142
He hadn't seen me in three years, and in
order to deal with my new theatrical career...

20:09.276 --> 20:12.913
he sat in the front row and took notes
throughout the whole production.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.083
He was very intellectual.

20:16.216 --> 20:21.088
And the woman who was playing the mother
was swearing in the dressing room —

20:21.221 --> 20:24.191
"Who the fuck is that asshole
in the front row taking notes?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.260
We've already been reviewed!"

20:26.393 --> 20:28.595
She was throwing ashtrays
around the dressing room.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.898
I said, "It's my brother, Rocky."

20:31.031 --> 20:33.901
And when Rocky and I got home...

20:34.034 --> 20:36.470
the first thing he did
was give me his notes.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.708
After I left Rhode Island, you see,
I wanted to go across country...

20:41.842 --> 20:43.710
and I didn't have
enough money to do it.

20:43.844 --> 20:47.180
I had this fantasy idea
that I thought every great actor...

20:47.314 --> 20:51.251
should both play Hamlet in his lifetime
and also fuck on stage.

20:51.385 --> 20:53.253
You know, should run the gamut...

20:53.387 --> 20:56.657
or else try to incorporate both in <i>Hamlet.</i>

20:56.790 --> 21:00.327
But <i>Hamlet</i> wasn't playing this summer,
or I didn't know about any auditions for it...

21:00.460 --> 21:04.665
so I ended up — To try to make money,
I ended up applying for a pornographic
movie.

21:04.798 --> 21:07.734
And I got the role.
I was really surprised.

21:07.868 --> 21:10.468
She would work on us. She would
work on me, say, with her mouth...

21:10.504 --> 21:12.806
and him with the hand,
and then vice versa.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.943
And then as soon as I was up...

21:16.076 --> 21:18.345
I'd start down as he went up...

21:18.478 --> 21:21.515
and we would never get it together.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.951
So finally he said,
"Clear the room."

21:24.084 --> 21:27.087
So the director would go out of the room,
and we'd work together...

21:27.220 --> 21:29.723
and we'd both get up,
and he'd say...

21:29.856 --> 21:31.925
"All right. Quick.
Bring the cameras back."

21:32.059 --> 21:36.096
And by the time the camera's set up,
we'd be down again.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.599
So it was a lot of work.

21:39.733 --> 21:43.370
We finally finished the shot.
It took about all afternoon.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.940
The director was very upset
and running around me, saying...

21:47.074 --> 21:49.443
"Make more noise, Gray.
Make more faces."

21:57.851 --> 21:59.586
<i>The Knack.</i>

21:59.720 --> 22:03.090
Not a very good play by Ann Jellicoe.

22:03.223 --> 22:05.392
I happen to have a copy of it here.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.395
I was in this play
at Theatre by the Sea...

22:08.528 --> 22:11.331
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

22:11.465 --> 22:15.902
I thought I should have played
the role of Tolen...

22:16.036 --> 22:19.539
but I got cast as Colin,
who was the stud.

22:19.673 --> 22:23.076
My father brought my mother
to see this play...

22:23.210 --> 22:26.213
while she was having
an incurable nervous breakdown.

22:28.448 --> 22:32.552
She thought she was coming to see
<i>Long Day's Journey Into Night.</i>

22:35.655 --> 22:38.725
Now, that wasn't because she was
having a nervous breakdown.

22:38.859 --> 22:41.995
That came after this play.
It wasn't completely an illusion...

22:42.129 --> 22:44.498
but my father brought her to this
because he thought...

22:44.631 --> 22:46.833
<i>Long Day's Journey</i>
would upset her too much...

22:46.967 --> 22:50.537
and I'm afraid that
this one was worse.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.541
I'm right up to this section...

22:54.674 --> 22:57.394
where the character, Brewster,
is trying to get away from his mother.

22:57.511 --> 23:01.081
It's the summer of 1966. She's having
a very severe nervous breakdown.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.518
He's trying to help her through it.
At the same time, he's very aware...

23:04.651 --> 23:06.520
that he must flee the nest.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.389
He must run away and begin
his own life, or he won't have one.

23:09.523 --> 23:11.825
And he desperately
wants to become an actor...

23:11.958 --> 23:15.929
and he wants to get his actor's equity card
at the Alley Theatre that season.

23:16.063 --> 23:19.066
They have a very good reputation.
Also, what is very important for him...

23:19.199 --> 23:21.968
is that they're doing
Chekhov's play <i>The Sea Gull...</i>

23:22.102 --> 23:24.237
and he is sure
that he is perfect for the role...

23:24.371 --> 23:27.707
of Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplev,
the young writer...

23:27.841 --> 23:31.344
positive he'll be cast in it
because he's sensitive like Konstantin...

23:31.478 --> 23:34.881
his relationship to his mother
is not unlike Konstantin's to his mother...

23:35.015 --> 23:37.684
and the other thing is that Konstantin
gets to shoot himself in the head...

23:37.818 --> 23:41.855
at the end of every play and come back
the following night to play himself again.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.857
Brewster likes this.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.526
And I'm there with my mother
in Rhode Island...

23:46.660 --> 23:48.295
and she is going mad.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.828
She's having a nervous breakdown.
She's tearing her hair out
from the back of her head.

23:51.932 --> 23:55.368
And I'm trying to calm her down
by reading to her from Alan Watts's book...

23:55.502 --> 23:58.238
<i>Psychotherapy East & West.</i>

23:58.371 --> 24:01.441
Laboring under that romantic idea
of R.D. Laing's...

24:01.575 --> 24:05.779
how every person who has
a nervous breakdown is so lucky...

24:05.912 --> 24:09.749
'cause they get to come out
the other side of it with such great wisdom...

24:09.883 --> 24:12.219
provided they come out
the other side.

24:12.352 --> 24:14.654
And I was trying to help my mother
through to the other side...

24:14.788 --> 24:16.690
but she wasn't listening to Alan Watts.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.593
She was reading from <i>Science and Health</i>
by Mary Baker Eddy...

24:19.726 --> 24:21.661
and from <i>The Christian Science Monitor.</i>

24:21.795 --> 24:24.498
And I remember that vividly,
that warm July day—

24:24.631 --> 24:26.867
she in her pajamas,
curled up on the couch...

24:27.000 --> 24:31.771
with <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>
between us like a Japanese paper wall.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.474
And I am so annoyed finally
that I can't get through to her...

24:34.608 --> 24:36.977
that I reach down
and just flick the paper.

24:38.111 --> 24:42.682
And she pulls the paper down
and looks me right in the eyes and says...

24:42.816 --> 24:45.152
"How shall I do it, dear?

24:45.285 --> 24:47.521
How shall I do it?

24:47.654 --> 24:50.590
Shall I do it in the garage
with the car?"

24:51.791 --> 24:54.594
The day I found out was that —

24:54.728 --> 24:56.897
My father didn't tell me
over the phone.

24:57.030 --> 25:00.467
I'd called him from —
let's see, from Houston...

25:00.600 --> 25:02.536
'cause I'd taken a train
up to Houston...

25:02.669 --> 25:04.838
and was gonna fly in
from Houston to Providence.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.041
And he picked me up.
It was a very hot August day.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.644
And I remember I had a bottle
of tequila in a brown bag.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.480
I'd been carrying it on the plane.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.850
And I was sipping it
outside the Providence airport.

25:16.983 --> 25:21.454
And he picked me up in his Ford LTD
with the air conditioner on.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.468
I remember it was very hot.
The windows were up.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.926
And he said,
"Tying one on, are you?"

25:26.059 --> 25:28.662
I had the bag of tequila...

25:28.795 --> 25:31.898
and we rode in silence for a bit,
and I said...

25:32.032 --> 25:34.100
"So how's Mom?"
'cause I knew she'd been having...

25:34.234 --> 25:36.269
this nervous breakdown
for two years...

25:36.403 --> 25:38.371
in and out of shock treatments.

25:38.505 --> 25:40.640
And he just started to —

25:40.774 --> 25:43.944
He broke down while he was driving.
He started to cry.

25:44.077 --> 25:46.913
Like, whimper.
It wasn't really full-blown.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.349
He said, "She's gone."

25:49.482 --> 25:53.420
And I remember,
looking back on it...

25:53.553 --> 25:55.422
turning to stone like a statue.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.892
And I just heard "gone." "Gone."
I was trying to make sense of "gone."

25:59.025 --> 26:01.795
And I remember "gone,"
like "died of a broken heart."

26:01.928 --> 26:04.164
I heard that Grimm's fairy tale line.

26:04.297 --> 26:07.834
And then I had an image — and all of this
may be fictionalized since then.

26:07.968 --> 26:10.704
But this is what I remember.
I had an image of a dandelion...

26:10.837 --> 26:14.207
when it's turned to fluff
at the end of the —

26:14.341 --> 26:17.811
Gone. Just gone.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.081
Not "dead," not "killed herself."

26:21.214 --> 26:24.317
Again, that was avoidance language
that was going on in Rhode Island.

26:24.451 --> 26:27.621
And when my mother's obituary
appeared, it was "deceased"...

26:27.754 --> 26:31.124
and the rumors were she died of cancer.
There was no mention of suicide.

26:31.258 --> 26:34.294
So when I began to talk about it,
and the <i>Providence Journal</i> did...

26:34.427 --> 26:37.330
a profile about me
doing my first piece...

26:37.464 --> 26:39.399
<i>Rumstick Road,</i>
with the Wooster Group...

26:39.532 --> 26:42.936
in which we did an exploration
of my mother's suicide in 1967...

26:43.069 --> 26:47.207
as a group piece — with tape recordings
and slides — it was a mixed-media piece...

26:47.340 --> 26:49.743
and that really led me
into my monologues.

26:49.876 --> 26:53.280
When they did a profile in
the <i>Providence Journal,</i> it was scandalous.

26:53.413 --> 26:56.182
I mean, my relatives were upset
that it would come out...

26:56.316 --> 26:59.653
that it was this suicide.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.426
My mother committed suicide.
Shortly after she committed suicide...

27:02.489 --> 27:05.325
the woman down the road,
her husband drank himself to death.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.862
So my father and this woman got together
to try to make a good marriage...

27:08.995 --> 27:11.264
and forget about the pain
and move into a perfect house.

27:11.398 --> 27:13.266
They moved
into this kind of a ranch house...

27:13.400 --> 27:15.568
that was like a very modern,
fully equipped motel...

27:15.702 --> 27:18.405
where you pull in the asphalt driveway.
On the right is a huge tennis court.

27:18.538 --> 27:20.473
You pull in,
push a button in the car...

27:20.607 --> 27:22.542
one of the three cars,
a three-car garage door goes up.

27:22.676 --> 27:25.196
Three cars are in the garage.
You go around to the front door...

27:25.245 --> 27:28.415
ring the doorbell. It plays 40 different tunes.
My father's always adjusting them every day.

27:28.548 --> 27:31.384
That particular day it was the <i>William Tell
Overture,</i> or next day would be...

27:31.518 --> 27:33.586
"The Whole World is Waiting
for the Sunrise," with a polka beat...

27:33.720 --> 27:35.889
or it might be "Jingle Bell Rock,"
according to the seasons.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.191
And you go in and there's a whole
weather station there on your left...

27:38.325 --> 27:40.860
with the barometric pressure
and the wind velocity and the temperature.

27:40.994 --> 27:43.897
And it's wall-to-wall carpeting
and Muzak playing in all the rooms.

27:44.030 --> 27:48.568
And in their bedroom,
between the twin beds,
there's a little box that makes white sound.

27:48.702 --> 27:51.838
You can turn it to static, you can turn it
to water, you can turn it to wind.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.674
My father likes to sleep with the static.
Said he couldn't get to sleep without it.

27:54.808 --> 27:57.644
Down in the basement —
And everything is going fine.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.947
Down in the basement, there are
two freezers filled to the top with meat.

28:01.081 --> 28:03.750
Up in the attic, there are rows and rows
of bourbon, rows and rows of Scotch...

28:03.883 --> 28:05.883
rows and rows of gin,
just like a liquor warehouse.

28:05.919 --> 28:08.888
There's an automatic generator that goes
on automatic pilot when the lights go out.

28:09.022 --> 28:13.193
And everything is going fine,
and everything is going fine,
and the cocktail hour begins about 5:00.

28:13.326 --> 28:15.762
We usually start in front
of the TV with <i>Zoom.</i>

28:15.895 --> 28:18.932
And after <i>Zoom,</i>
6:00 news, the 6:30 news...

28:19.065 --> 28:22.001
the 7:00 news, and we're eating
somewhere around <i>The Odd Couple.</i>

28:22.135 --> 28:24.971
Now, I never know whether I'm talking to my
father, my stepmother, or <i>The Odd Couple.</i>

28:25.105 --> 28:27.273
It all kind of blends in.

28:27.407 --> 28:29.776
And everything is going fine,
except this particular day, it's summer...

28:29.909 --> 28:32.278
and we're eating outside,
and the only problem is flies.

28:32.412 --> 28:35.115
"There's a fly. Look out.
Close the door. Get out the bomber."

28:35.248 --> 28:38.618
My father got out this big fogger
and set it off by the picnic table out back...

28:38.752 --> 28:41.721
and my stepmother, who collects antiques,
got out the antique fly gun.

28:41.855 --> 28:44.491
You pull it back like this and line it up
a certain distance from the fly...

28:44.624 --> 28:48.428
and if you're all right,
the thing goes "thump."

28:48.561 --> 28:51.030
And everything is going fine,
and everything is going fine...

28:51.164 --> 28:53.604
except someone stole his flagpole twice
with the flag on it...

28:53.733 --> 28:56.169
so he's had to cement this one in,
and everything is going fine...

28:56.302 --> 29:00.640
except the swimming pool has cracks in it,
it's leaking, and the AstroTurf is shrinking.

29:02.876 --> 29:06.146
And everything is going fine,
and everything is going fine,
except for the squirrels...

29:06.279 --> 29:09.215
the gypsy moths,
and a pig farmer named Rocky.

29:11.985 --> 29:14.988
Now, these pigs — It's a good ways away,
but if the wind is wrong...

29:15.121 --> 29:17.457
you smell the garbage
when you're in the swimming pool.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.460
And this is driving them nuts,
because it's an imperfection, you see.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.730
It's an imperfection.
So what they found out was —

29:23.863 --> 29:26.132
They investigated.
There's a town ordinance...

29:26.266 --> 29:28.226
that you can't have pigs
next to private property.

29:28.334 --> 29:32.405
But there's a good chunk of very expensive
property between their property
and Rocky the pig farmer.

29:32.539 --> 29:35.675
And there's another problem too,
because my father's name is Rocky.

29:38.545 --> 29:41.585
So there's a very big, expensive piece
of property between there and there...

29:41.714 --> 29:44.918
and so they go down and buy it,
and the next day they take Rocky to court —

29:45.051 --> 29:47.854
the pig farmer — and they say,
"You can't have pigs next to our property."

29:47.987 --> 29:50.356
He says, "You don't own that property."
And he says...

29:50.490 --> 29:52.592
"We bought it this morning, my friend."

29:56.529 --> 29:58.631
<i>It was 1967...</i>

29:58.765 --> 30:03.136
<i>and I just escaped the draft
by the skin of my... whatever —</i>

30:03.269 --> 30:06.172
<i>chance, luck —
that I didn't go to Vietnam...</i>

30:06.306 --> 30:08.842
<i>and I got very disillusioned
with theater, regional theater...</i>

30:08.975 --> 30:11.344
and the lack of adventure...

30:11.478 --> 30:14.514
and experimentation,
and I started reading...

30:14.647 --> 30:17.417
about Andre Gregory being thrown
out of Theatre for the Living Arts...

30:17.550 --> 30:19.786
for doing Rochelle Owens's play,
<i>Beclch.</i>

30:19.919 --> 30:22.989
And the board of directors had fired him.
He'd gone to New York City
to start a company.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.242
So I read that in <i>The New York Times,</i>
and I thought...

30:25.325 --> 30:27.193
"Well, someone's getting fired
for doing something.

30:27.327 --> 30:30.797
I wonder what that something is, and I'm
gonna take a check-out in New York City."

30:30.930 --> 30:34.067
My first publicity shot
in New York City.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.402
I didn't know who to go to
when I came here.

30:36.536 --> 30:39.906
I just took a <i>Backstage</i> magazine,
you know, and I took it out.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.975
I took the first ad
that said "photographer."

30:42.108 --> 30:44.310
I go. This guy must have had...

30:44.444 --> 30:46.946
his great-grandfather's camera
from the Civil War.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.450
He had a canopy he threw over his head,
and there was a wooden cup over the lens...

30:50.583 --> 30:53.086
and he took it off and counted
the exposure — one, two —

30:53.219 --> 30:55.088
and then put it back like this.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.925
A 1969 publicity shot.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.166
I was doing a workshop
with the Open Theater...

31:07.300 --> 31:10.336
which was an experimental group
run by Joe Chaikin...

31:10.470 --> 31:13.239
and Joyce Aaron was running
the workshop as a free, open workshop...

31:13.373 --> 31:16.876
and we were asked —
and this was in 1969, in New York City—

31:17.010 --> 31:19.345
to come in and just bring in
a story and jam on it...

31:19.479 --> 31:23.283
in a kind of way that if you didn't remember
the whole story, you could repeat a word.

31:23.416 --> 31:25.251
And I didn't repeat anything once.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.588
I just did a story of my day
as fast as I could speak it.

31:28.721 --> 31:31.324
And at the end of the workshop,
Joyce, who was running it...

31:31.457 --> 31:34.260
asked me who wrote it.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.763
She thought it had been
prewritten and memorized.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.299
And in 1969, I had a little hint...

31:39.432 --> 31:41.568
that I had some sort of talent
for storytelling...

31:41.701 --> 31:45.705
but there was no place for it then,
and it didn't come out till ten years later.

31:45.838 --> 31:50.476
It wasn't my choice to go to India.
I was going with a performance group
to do Brecht's <i>Mother Courage.</i>

31:50.610 --> 31:53.212
I don't know why.

31:54.614 --> 31:58.017
We had gotten
a John D. Rockefeller III travel grant...

31:58.151 --> 32:01.754
to do this.
That paid for our tickets over.

32:01.888 --> 32:05.425
But when I was in India — I began
searching for a guru when I was in India...

32:05.558 --> 32:09.028
because, well, I started getting
interested in tantric gurus.

32:09.162 --> 32:11.864
I was looking for tantric masters
because I had become...

32:11.998 --> 32:14.300
sexually obsessed in India.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.404
I think it had to do
with the fact that I knew...

32:18.538 --> 32:20.773
there was a lot of sexuality
going on in the country...

32:20.907 --> 32:23.176
because there were so many people
and so many children...

32:23.309 --> 32:26.245
but I didn't know where it was operative...

32:26.379 --> 32:28.548
where it was happening.

32:28.681 --> 32:31.818
I couldn't understand it
through my cultural view of my eyes.

32:31.951 --> 32:35.955
And so I was searching around for these
tantric masters that could teach me...

32:36.089 --> 32:38.409
and there were supposed to be
a few tantric masters left...

32:38.458 --> 32:40.393
that practiced this tantric sexuality.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.462
You get in a tantric pose
and you say...

32:42.595 --> 32:45.698
"I am one who is doing this."
You know, "I am one —"

32:45.832 --> 32:49.502
and then you don't spread any—
waste any seed.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.704
I waited two weeks,
applied for an audience.

32:51.838 --> 32:55.241
And then what you have to do
is you must come to his gate...

32:55.375 --> 32:58.444
around 6:00 out back, because
you go around the back of his house.

32:58.578 --> 33:01.347
And you're not to wear
any scented soaps...

33:01.481 --> 33:05.284
or perfume or shaving lotion,
anything — or cut flowers —

33:05.418 --> 33:07.420
because any kind of scent...

33:07.553 --> 33:10.089
will cause the guru to leave his body.

33:12.225 --> 33:16.696
And he had been leaving it by accident,
you know, as a result of these scents...

33:16.829 --> 33:19.732
and the <i>sannyasis</i> were afraid
he wouldn't come back.

33:19.866 --> 33:23.136
Some people came and knelt,
and he shone a little penlight in their eye...

33:23.269 --> 33:25.304
and then gave them a holy name
and put the <i>mala</i> around.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.675
Well, when I knelt down, it was obvious
I wasn't about to take the <i>mala.</i>

33:28.808 --> 33:32.211
I really wanted to just say,
"Look, which workshop is the orgy?"

33:35.915 --> 33:38.451
I met this American expatriate
on the plane that was living in Paris...

33:38.584 --> 33:40.386
and he had friends
down in Greece.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.257
He said, "No problem at all. Come with me.
Take a room in the hotel I'm staying in...

33:44.390 --> 33:47.460
and then we'll go out to eat,
we'll have some drinks.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.997
You go up and see the ruins first.
Then we'll meet, have drinks and eat."

33:51.130 --> 33:54.167
By then, I knew that this guy
was a homosexual. He was gay.

33:54.300 --> 33:59.205
He told me, "It's much better to be gay
if you're traveling a lot, you know?

33:59.338 --> 34:03.342
It's just much more convenient.
You have more sexual activity."

34:03.476 --> 34:06.679
"Oh, really?" I said.
"Yeah," he said. "No, this is true."

34:09.181 --> 34:11.451
I got into bed,
and I started feeling — mm —

34:11.583 --> 34:15.588
that kind of springtime feeling
in the base of my spine, a little slight itch.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.860
And I thought, uh...

34:23.629 --> 34:26.399
"I wonder why he didn't
try to seduce me.

34:29.936 --> 34:31.838
What's wrong with me?"

34:35.908 --> 34:37.944
"What's wrong with him?"

34:39.746 --> 34:42.882
And I thought,
"Maybe I should go ask him.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.384
Yeah."

34:45.518 --> 34:47.487
So I got up, I got dressed...

34:47.620 --> 34:49.388
and I went out
and I knocked on his door.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.958
He said, "Who is it?"
I said, "Spalding."

34:52.091 --> 34:55.194
He said, "Come in."
So I kind of went along the wall.

34:55.328 --> 34:57.430
I came in, and I said...

35:02.235 --> 35:04.403
"We've got to, uh, do something."

35:06.105 --> 35:08.274
He said, "Uh, go take a shower.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.309
You can use my shower,
and then we'll talk."

35:10.443 --> 35:12.812
So I came out of the shower
dripping, and, um —

35:12.945 --> 35:15.047
Look, I figured it was safe.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.683
He was clean.

35:17.817 --> 35:20.319
He was nice. He was —

35:20.453 --> 35:22.388
It was better than one of those —
It was a private room.

35:22.522 --> 35:24.824
I figured I was going to be
traveling in Greece.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.893
I might as well get initiated.

35:29.095 --> 35:31.597
And, uh...

35:31.731 --> 35:35.268
I thought it was better than one of those
steamy New York City gay baths...

35:35.401 --> 35:38.738
and, uh —

35:38.871 --> 35:40.873
And who would ever know?

35:42.909 --> 35:46.646
So he said,
"What do you like to do?"

35:46.779 --> 35:48.714
And I said, "Oh, huh."

35:51.617 --> 35:53.719
"I don't know. I don't know.
What do you like to do?"

35:53.853 --> 35:57.723
He said, "Oh, I like
having my cock sucked."

35:59.692 --> 36:01.561
I said...

36:04.931 --> 36:07.133
"I would never do that."

36:10.069 --> 36:12.305
Next thing I knew, I was in bed with him,
like on automatic pilot.

36:12.438 --> 36:15.308
It was such a surprise.
I was in there, I had my arms around him...

36:15.441 --> 36:19.011
and it was a real surprise,
because he was soft like a woman.

36:19.145 --> 36:22.515
His skin was very soft,
and it was good to be next to someone...

36:22.648 --> 36:25.518
after traveling around
all that time and just —

36:25.651 --> 36:28.421
But I didn't relax with it, you know?
It was too much for me just then...

36:28.554 --> 36:30.690
and I just went right down on him.

36:30.823 --> 36:32.692
I didn't waste any more time.
And while I was doing it...

36:32.825 --> 36:34.745
I was thinking in my head
all the time like this:

36:34.827 --> 36:37.964
"I am a homosexual, I am a homosexual,
I am a homosexual, I am a homosexual...

36:38.097 --> 36:39.966
I am a homosexual,
I am a homosexual."

36:40.099 --> 36:42.668
And suddenly it broke
like a bubble in my head, you know...

36:42.802 --> 36:44.704
and I was suddenly
finding myself sucking...

36:44.837 --> 36:47.907
on this kind of disconnected
rubber garden hose...

36:48.040 --> 36:50.610
semi-choking.

36:50.743 --> 36:54.280
And — I don't know. Some of you
may know what I'm talking about.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.350
This disconnected feeling.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.986
He said, "Oh!"
He caught on.

37:00.119 --> 37:02.955
He said
"Spalding, ease down, ease down.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.426
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.863
I mean, there's no sense
torturing yourself.

37:12.098 --> 37:14.233
Is there?"

37:15.835 --> 37:18.037
Every morning I was calling up
and saying to the airplane...

37:18.170 --> 37:22.008
"This is Mr. Gray. I have an open ticket.
I'd like to fly at 6:00 tonight."

37:22.141 --> 37:24.143
"Anything you say, Mr. Gray.
You have an open ticket."

37:24.277 --> 37:26.279
And I'd go have a couple beers,
and I'd think about Greece...

37:26.412 --> 37:30.149
and I'd come back and call and say,
"No, cancel it. I'm going to fly another time."

37:30.283 --> 37:32.151
"Anything you say, Mr. Gray.
You have an open ticket."

37:32.285 --> 37:34.887
I was beginning to like this, you know?

37:35.021 --> 37:38.157
No. It was more power
than I'd had in all my life.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.993
Big Royal Dutch 747.

37:41.127 --> 37:43.062
So Liz said,
"You better go back with me."

37:43.195 --> 37:45.698
I said, "Sure.
You make the reservation. You do it.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.334
You call them, tell them we'll show up."
We showed up at the airport, right?

37:48.467 --> 37:50.870
We got to the airport, and I started pacing
around. She said, "What's wrong?"

37:51.003 --> 37:54.540
I said, "I can't go. I have to go — I —"

37:54.674 --> 37:57.514
And she said, "Wait a minute.
You'd better get your bags off the plane."

37:57.610 --> 38:01.580
So I went over to the woman and said,
"Can you —"

38:01.714 --> 38:03.816
"No, skip it. Just leave my bags on.
I'm not going."

38:03.950 --> 38:07.053
She said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Gray.
You have to accompany your bags
back to New York City.

38:07.186 --> 38:09.322
They can't go without you."
I said, "Can you take them off?"

38:09.455 --> 38:11.490
She said, "I think we can."
She got her walkie-talkie out.

38:11.624 --> 38:13.960
- She said, "Do you want —"
- I said, "Yes. No. Uh —

38:14.093 --> 38:16.329
Yes. No."

38:18.831 --> 38:20.933
I started barking at her.
It was unbelievable.

38:21.067 --> 38:24.503
And her eyes were rolling in her head,
and Liz just walked on ahead...

38:24.637 --> 38:27.106
as though she didn't know me,
you know?

38:27.239 --> 38:30.509
I had a rather —

38:30.643 --> 38:34.680
a kind of nervous collapse that lasted
maybe four or five months.

38:34.814 --> 38:38.250
A lot of not being able to stay awake
and very depressed...

38:38.384 --> 38:41.287
and it was triggered
by a lot of regret, of saying...

38:41.420 --> 38:43.756
"I should've done this in India, and
I could've done that, and I didn't do that"...

38:43.889 --> 38:45.758
rather than looking
at things I did do.

38:45.891 --> 38:50.029
So coming out of that breakdown,
I started keeping a journal, a diary.

38:50.162 --> 38:53.866
And it was just a regular diary.
That was a real daily diary.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.370
And each morning
I would write in that day...

38:57.503 --> 38:59.505
saying, "This is what
I did the day before."

38:59.638 --> 39:02.108
I let sleep be the filter system.

39:02.241 --> 39:04.677
And it was healing
in the sense of saying...

39:04.810 --> 39:07.480
"This is what I did,
not what I didn't do."

39:07.613 --> 39:10.383
This developed a very—

39:10.516 --> 39:13.953
And this was seven years
I did this without missing a day.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.989
And this developed a terrific...

39:17.123 --> 39:20.026
like almost "cinemagraphic"
or photographic memory for detail.

39:20.159 --> 39:24.397
And slowly I began to understand
that what my art form was —

39:24.530 --> 39:26.432
and bless them,
it was the Wooster Group...

39:26.565 --> 39:28.567
that pushed me
and was the first audience.

39:28.701 --> 39:31.837
<i>Elizabeth LeCompte and I
had some time on our own...</i>

39:31.971 --> 39:35.641
<i>to develop our own pieces, and we just
started playing around in the garage.</i>

39:35.775 --> 39:38.544
<i>And we began to use
my memories and life experiences</i>

39:38.677 --> 39:41.213
<i>as a kind of source material
to build our pieces on.</i>

39:41.347 --> 39:44.750
<i>We did a trilogy called</i>
Three Places in Rhode Island...

39:44.884 --> 39:47.219
<i>and Liz LeCompte and the group
would tape-record them...</i>

39:47.353 --> 39:49.388
<i>transcribe them,
and I'd look at them and go...</i>

39:49.522 --> 39:52.992
"Aha! That's writing!"

39:53.125 --> 39:56.729
And what happened was that the writer's
voice began to push the actor's voice out.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.798
When I say "writer's voice,"
what do I mean?

39:58.931 --> 40:02.468
I couldn't spell.
I couldn't write. I could barely read.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.703
I didn't know that had
nothing to do with writing.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.842
This self-reflector's
writer's voice began to —

40:09.975 --> 40:12.078
I couldn't memorize my texts properly.

40:12.211 --> 40:15.648
I was always interpolating
or adding my own words.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.350
So the little voice began
to whisper to me...

40:18.484 --> 40:21.353
"What if, in fact, you were
speaking your own words?

40:21.487 --> 40:24.723
What would they be?"
And I began to do that.

40:24.857 --> 40:28.461
In 1979, at the Performing Garage
in downtown Manhattan...

40:28.594 --> 40:30.896
I did my first monologue
and called it...

40:31.030 --> 40:34.100
<i>Sex and Death to the Age 14.</i>

40:34.233 --> 40:36.602
I sat down at this table in front of
whoever came. It was word of mouth.

40:36.735 --> 40:41.407
Maybe there were 15 or 16 people there,
or less — or 12 people —

40:41.540 --> 40:44.220
and I put on the <i>Donna Diana Overture</i>
and just played the opening...

40:44.276 --> 40:47.146
and lifted the needle,
and I had my little outline...

40:47.279 --> 40:50.382
and it was everything I could remember
about sex and death till the age 14...

40:50.516 --> 40:53.252
which was the name of the monologue,
and I tape-recorded it.

40:53.385 --> 40:57.556
And the first night it was maybe,
oh, 50 minutes long.

40:57.690 --> 41:00.659
Then I went back and listened to the tape,
and I had all these massive...

41:00.793 --> 41:03.129
<i>associations and memories
and restructured the outline.</i>

41:03.262 --> 41:05.664
<i>Went back the next night.
It was 60 minutes.</i>

41:05.798 --> 41:09.101
<i>Then it was an hour and five,
hour and ten, hour and 30 —</i>

41:09.235 --> 41:12.471
almost all 19 monologues
have come in at an hour and 30 —

41:12.605 --> 41:16.242
and it just fell into that form, and it became
my first autobiographic monologue.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.845
And what it did was trigger
enormous amounts of memory.

41:19.979 --> 41:22.181
I went right on to the next one,
<i>Booze, Cars, and College Girls...</i>

41:22.314 --> 41:24.194
then <i>A Personal History
of the American Theater.</i>

41:24.316 --> 41:28.120
But, you see, this unlocked
a whole new method of working.

41:28.254 --> 41:31.090
I became
like an inverted method actor.

41:31.223 --> 41:32.958
You see?

41:35.227 --> 41:37.796
I was using myself to play myself.

41:39.031 --> 41:42.168
I was playing with myself.

41:42.301 --> 41:46.438
It was a kind of creative narcissism.
And this began to develop, you see?

41:46.572 --> 41:50.809
More memories came, and I began
to develop this little cottage industry.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.678
And I began to tour.

41:52.811 --> 41:55.047
Wherever people would ask me to go,
I'd take these monologues.

41:55.181 --> 41:57.583
And sometimes I'd go out alone.
Sometimes I'd go with my girlfriend, Renée.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.185
Now how did you meet?

41:59.318 --> 42:01.287
Oh, God, we met in Studio 54.

42:01.420 --> 42:03.656
Couldn't have been
a more ludicrous meeting place.

42:03.789 --> 42:06.325
I mean, it was a downtown
celebration of the arts.

42:06.458 --> 42:09.094
I got an arts award, and we were —

42:09.562 --> 42:12.698
I saw her across a crowded room,
and her face lit up, and I loved it —

42:12.831 --> 42:15.868
a very open, soulful face.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.170
And I asked her to dance...

42:18.304 --> 42:21.340
and she said
I tried to come on too much.

42:21.473 --> 42:24.743
I was, like, too physical
with her, and she fled.

42:24.877 --> 42:26.579
She thought I was married.
I wasn't.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.714
I was living with someone at the time,
but we were breaking up.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.383
And I pursued her and I found her,
and we had a date...

42:31.517 --> 42:33.452
and we went out,
and those were the days —

42:33.586 --> 42:35.854
I think on the first date
we were back in bed...

42:35.988 --> 42:38.724
and she was nervous and drank
the wrong drinks and said...

42:38.857 --> 42:40.726
"Excuse me.
I'm gonna throw up."

42:40.859 --> 42:43.796
So in the middle of our first
making love, she threw up...

42:43.929 --> 42:46.332
and I held her head
and put a pot under it...

42:46.465 --> 42:48.000
and that was
our bonding, I think.

42:48.133 --> 42:51.403
We bonded around that vomiting.

42:51.537 --> 42:54.173
And we had a horrible fight
when we started out.

42:54.306 --> 42:57.643
I think it was, Renée missed
her New York support system.

43:00.412 --> 43:04.617
That was the first item.
Then she said that sex was a red herring...

43:06.018 --> 43:08.420
and we started talking
about what a red herring was.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.993
And then she said,
"But we're not equals, you see?"

43:14.126 --> 43:16.061
And then she finally said, "Look...

43:16.195 --> 43:19.965
I feel like I'm driving you
3,000 miles to work!"

43:23.002 --> 43:24.270
See?

43:24.403 --> 43:28.307
I started asserting myself,
you know?

43:28.440 --> 43:32.144
I said, "I don't give a shit if you go, really.
I can't take this arguing anymore."

43:32.278 --> 43:36.582
And my assertion made us both
incredibly horny, and we, uh...

43:36.715 --> 43:40.953
we pulled the car over, and we had
the best sex of the whole trip, you know?

43:41.086 --> 43:44.857
It had nothing to do with positions
or where the car was parked.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.959
It was just something —

43:48.027 --> 43:50.663
I get tired of talking about myself.

43:50.796 --> 43:53.077
And when I do, I do
the conversations with the audience...

43:53.165 --> 43:56.201
and it's a way of getting outside
of myself and hopefully empathizing...

43:56.335 --> 43:58.237
with another person's story.

43:58.370 --> 44:00.439
So the conversations
are always guided...

44:00.572 --> 44:02.508
toward trying to bring up
a story in someone...

44:02.641 --> 44:05.611
about whatever topic
we're dwelling on that day.

44:05.744 --> 44:07.713
It's a beautiful piece...

44:07.846 --> 44:10.015
because people don't have
any public conversations in America.

44:10.149 --> 44:13.585
They're always 12-step programs.
They always have an agenda.

44:13.719 --> 44:15.721
There is no agenda in this.

44:15.854 --> 44:19.058
And the audience has to find
what's interesting for them.

44:19.191 --> 44:21.226
They have to do the editing,
you know?

44:21.360 --> 44:23.228
And they will or they won't.
They're in and out of it.

44:23.362 --> 44:25.230
Some people
are more interesting than others.

44:25.364 --> 44:28.500
But I've gotten more intuitive
of choosing people that will be able...

44:28.634 --> 44:31.337
to be communicative
and come out, you know?

44:31.470 --> 44:34.239
- Did you try to kill yourself?
- No. No, no, no.

44:34.373 --> 44:37.276
It was — I would never kill —
I mean —

44:37.409 --> 44:39.845
<i>You never tried to kill yourself?</i>

44:39.978 --> 44:43.282
Um, never.

44:43.415 --> 44:46.885
<i>- Mm. Did you think about it?</i>
- No. I, um —

44:47.019 --> 44:48.954
I think it's a real bad joke.

44:49.088 --> 44:52.024
<i>- Huh? You think it's a bad joke?</i>
- Yeah.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.960
<i>- You don't like it.</i>
- I don't like it. It's a real bad joke.

44:55.094 --> 44:57.229
Real, you know, bad joke.

44:57.363 --> 44:59.331
I get — And makes me angry.

45:02.301 --> 45:05.471
No, it's the least you can do.
It's so short, you know?

45:05.604 --> 45:07.639
It's the least you can do.
Just hang in.

45:07.773 --> 45:11.076
You never know, you know?
You just never know.

45:11.210 --> 45:13.645
<i>Do you know anyone
that's ever killed themselves?</i>

45:13.779 --> 45:17.349
You know, that guy I was married to
the first time, he did.

45:17.483 --> 45:20.652
- Just two or three years ago.
<i>- He killed himself?</i>

45:20.786 --> 45:24.189
And I haven't seen him
for 20 years, or 30.

45:25.491 --> 45:29.228
And it's been very upsetting
to think, you know —

45:29.361 --> 45:31.330
I hadn't seen him.
I hadn't thought about him.

45:31.463 --> 45:34.767
He did that.
And it's true: It does have a kicker.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.336
I mean —

45:37.469 --> 45:40.005
If you can't make it any other way,
you can do it that way.

45:40.139 --> 45:42.908
It's gonna have a real impact,
but it's a shock.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.744
It just doesn't — doesn't do it.

45:45.878 --> 45:47.513
<i>Mm.</i>

45:47.646 --> 45:50.783
But it, like, removes things.
It doesn't add.

45:53.852 --> 45:57.556
- I just don't like it. It scares me.
<i>- Right.</i>

45:57.689 --> 46:00.859
- I don't want you to do it. Anybody.
<i>- Right.</i>

46:00.993 --> 46:02.528
That's all.

46:02.661 --> 46:05.030
I was taking them on.
I was taking on their stories.

46:05.164 --> 46:07.733
- I was interviewing them onstage.
<i>- Who were you interviewing?</i>

46:07.866 --> 46:10.135
I was interviewing people
from the streets of L.A.

46:10.269 --> 46:12.938
I was interviewing a woman who had just
been picked up in a mother ship...

46:13.071 --> 46:15.140
a flying saucer
on the Ventura Freeway...

46:15.274 --> 46:19.278
and her car was going west,
and then an hour later it was going east...

46:19.411 --> 46:21.947
and she had to be deprogrammed
to figure out she'd been on a spaceship.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.316
So the next person
I have in is a person...

46:24.450 --> 46:26.251
who's the head
of the Aetherius Church out there...

46:26.385 --> 46:29.555
that believes flying saucers
are 15,000 miles up...

46:29.688 --> 46:31.623
above the Earth,
sending down positive energy.

46:31.757 --> 46:34.159
In this church, they have
a big battery that looks kind of like...

46:34.293 --> 46:36.261
a small radiator on stilts...

46:36.395 --> 46:39.364
and they receive the energy
from these flying saucers.

46:39.498 --> 46:42.768
Then, when there's a natural disaster
in the United States, they aim the battery.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.871
They go up and aim it at that disaster
and send out the positive energy.

46:46.004 --> 46:49.541
I say to him, "Wait, have any of your people
ever been picked up by flying saucers?"

46:49.675 --> 46:51.610
He said,
"No, they're 15,000 miles up."

46:51.743 --> 46:55.023
I said, "We had a woman in here the other
night that was on a ship," and he goes...

46:56.048 --> 46:59.351
- "Crazy."
- She's nuts. She's nuts.

46:59.485 --> 47:01.353
<i>Do you have any fears?</i>

47:01.487 --> 47:03.489
No. Well, actually, yeah.

47:03.622 --> 47:05.557
<i>What?</i>

47:07.125 --> 47:09.561
Going home and getting beat up —
beaten up.

47:09.695 --> 47:13.465
<i>- Have you ever been beat up?</i>
- Once.

47:13.599 --> 47:17.102
What happened? People —
Who beat you up?

47:19.505 --> 47:21.340
- People.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

47:21.473 --> 47:23.575
Large people. Yeah.

47:23.709 --> 47:25.944
A large gang of people.

47:26.078 --> 47:28.914
<i>Was there any way
of getting back at them?</i>

47:29.047 --> 47:31.250
- Me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

47:31.383 --> 47:33.452
No. By myself?

47:33.585 --> 47:35.654
<i>- Right.</i>
- No.

47:35.787 --> 47:37.723
<i>Did you talk to your father about it,
or anyone bigger?</i>

47:37.856 --> 47:39.558
No.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.994
I couldn't.
Well, never mind.

47:42.127 --> 47:44.229
<i>You kept it a secret?</i>

47:44.363 --> 47:46.231
- Yeah.
<i>- Right.</i>

47:46.365 --> 47:49.601
Well, now I'm not.
It's on television now.

47:49.735 --> 47:53.472
Are there any secrets
that I have?

47:53.605 --> 47:56.808
Are there stories that I don't tell?

47:56.942 --> 47:58.544
Yes.

47:59.878 --> 48:02.581
<i>If I'm going into a situation
that I know is gonna be loaded...</i>

48:02.714 --> 48:04.583
like the making of <i>The Killing Fields,</i>
for instance...

48:04.716 --> 48:08.186
I kept a pretty tight diary
for the facts, for the details.

48:08.320 --> 48:12.090
Then, when I get home from
<i>The Killing Fields,</i> three months after...

48:12.224 --> 48:15.360
because I do refer to myself
as a poetic journalist...

48:15.494 --> 48:17.462
in the sense
that any good journalist...

48:17.596 --> 48:19.765
would try to get the story in
as quickly as possible...

48:19.898 --> 48:24.436
I am working on a story,
but I like it to gel...

48:24.570 --> 48:28.807
and sit in my unconscious or my dream
state or my regular life for a while...

48:28.941 --> 48:31.543
and then after three months' time,
I'll make an outline.

48:31.677 --> 48:35.581
<i>Swimming</i> was a radical — and I'd always
been rooting for that — breakthrough.

48:35.714 --> 48:38.584
So I was out in L.A.,
performing at the Mark Taper Forum...

48:38.717 --> 48:40.652
Taper Two,
<i>Swimming to Cambodia...</i>

48:40.786 --> 48:43.555
and of course, I was in film land,
and everyone was approaching me...

48:43.689 --> 48:46.758
and they were doing,
"Let's just get it down real quick on 16 mm.

48:46.892 --> 48:50.028
Don't bother with the contract.
We want to just document this."

48:50.162 --> 48:52.164
<i>And Renée said,
"You take control.</i>

48:52.297 --> 48:54.700
<i>You got everyone wanting to do it.
I'll produce it.</i>

48:54.833 --> 48:57.102
<i>You choose the director."</i>

48:57.235 --> 49:01.373
<i>It really reached a larger audience,
and I became more popular.</i>

49:01.506 --> 49:03.742
Did you read any of
<i>Swimming to Cambodia?</i>

49:03.875 --> 49:06.244
I read about half of it.
I should have read it all...

49:06.378 --> 49:09.781
but I got involved with other things,
and I like it very much.

49:09.915 --> 49:13.552
- You were able to read it, though.
- Oh, it's very amusing in places.

49:13.685 --> 49:17.122
I can just picture some of these things,
doing them myself.

49:17.255 --> 49:18.890
Really?

49:19.024 --> 49:21.093
Well, those scenes in New York...

49:21.226 --> 49:24.026
where you would go down the street
snapping your fingers three times...

49:24.129 --> 49:26.465
or six times or whatever
for some reason —

49:26.598 --> 49:28.667
- I've forgotten what it was now.
- The compulsive behavior.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.169
Yeah, but I've done
the same thing myself...

49:31.303 --> 49:33.705
- Yeah.
- when I was younger.

49:33.839 --> 49:35.941
Now you're over it, right?

49:36.074 --> 49:39.645
I like telling the story of life
better than I do living it.

49:39.778 --> 49:41.647
I'm very reflective.

49:41.780 --> 49:45.651
I mean, I just enjoy telling the story,
and the event feeds that.

49:45.784 --> 49:47.986
But how does that quell
your fears of living?

49:48.120 --> 49:50.822
Uh, control.
See, I'm afraid of life.

49:50.956 --> 49:53.558
I don't know how you deal with this,
but everything is chance.

49:53.692 --> 49:56.328
It's a miracle to me that I'm here,
that the plane made it.

49:56.461 --> 49:58.930
That the sun came up.

49:59.064 --> 50:02.401
As soon as you don't have any form
of God or meaning in your life...

50:02.534 --> 50:04.403
then you make it up
as you go along.

50:04.536 --> 50:07.706
And certainly, doing the monologue is
making it up, getting control over it...

50:07.839 --> 50:11.143
giving it structure to what is normally
chaos to me every day.

50:11.276 --> 50:14.346
The monologue you're going to hear
tonight is a monologue about a man...

50:14.479 --> 50:18.016
who can't write a book about a man
who can't take a vacation.

50:24.022 --> 50:27.059
Now, as soon as I signed
the contract for the book...

50:27.192 --> 50:29.327
I decided that I would give up
doing monologues.

50:29.461 --> 50:33.598
I'd just completely give them up.
I felt they were making me too extroverted.

50:36.868 --> 50:39.304
Perhaps even pandering.

50:39.438 --> 50:42.038
And what I wanted to do was pull in
to my more introverted self...

50:42.107 --> 50:44.409
that I hadn't been in touch with
in 20 years...

50:44.543 --> 50:48.880
and just begin to work
on writing in a private way...

50:49.014 --> 50:51.183
and go away to a writers' colony,
if I could get in one...

50:51.316 --> 50:53.685
'cause I thought that would prove
I was a writer if they'd accept me...

50:53.819 --> 50:55.687
and just write the book.

50:55.821 --> 50:57.522
No living. Just writing.

50:57.656 --> 51:02.060
And finally I did get down to the writing,
and I got down to it, and it was awful.

51:03.195 --> 51:07.165
I don't know why I'd romanticized it.
It's disgusting.

51:07.299 --> 51:10.469
Writing is like a disease.
It <i>is</i> a disease.

51:10.602 --> 51:13.672
It steals your body from you.
There's no audience.

51:13.805 --> 51:16.508
There's no feedback.
There's — There's —

51:16.641 --> 51:19.945
It's —
My hand was swelling up —

51:20.078 --> 51:23.181
my knuckle, from the pen pressing
against it, 'cause I was writing longhand.

51:23.315 --> 51:25.350
I was losing my sight in my left eye.

51:25.484 --> 51:28.487
I was going blind in my left eye,
which was horrible for me...

51:28.620 --> 51:31.556
because here I was,
working on all my Oedipal themes.

51:31.690 --> 51:33.959
And I thought...

51:34.092 --> 51:37.629
"There goes the first eye."

51:37.763 --> 51:39.464
Which is more frightening —

51:39.598 --> 51:42.467
to go out on a stage as yourself...

51:42.601 --> 51:44.870
or to go out on a stage
as a character?

51:45.003 --> 51:47.572
Well, it's flip-flopped.
Now it's more frightening...

51:47.706 --> 51:52.110
to go out on the stage
as a character, because I was —

51:52.244 --> 51:55.747
I got to the point, I think,
that I was hiding behind myself.

51:55.881 --> 51:57.749
The self became like a mask.
Not hiding...

51:57.883 --> 52:00.185
but there was a persona there
that I was working behind.

52:00.318 --> 52:03.889
Now I'm playing. Now I am rehearsing
for the role of the caretaker...

52:04.022 --> 52:05.891
in the Broadway revival of <i>Our Town...</i>

52:06.024 --> 52:08.059
that's going on at the Lyceum,
and I'm terrified.

52:08.193 --> 52:11.096
- Why?
- Because I am having to do...

52:11.229 --> 52:13.465
a role that's not dissimilar
from myself...

52:13.598 --> 52:16.935
but I'm having to say someone else's
words, and in a very tight girdle.

52:17.068 --> 52:20.005
And I have this terrific
rebellious feeling...

52:20.138 --> 52:22.174
like I had back in school...

52:22.307 --> 52:25.243
to do a parody of the play—
My subconscious —

52:25.377 --> 52:27.746
I want to tell a story about —
I'm discursive.

52:27.879 --> 52:29.748
I'm associative.
That's how I work.

52:29.881 --> 52:32.651
So every time I say a line
from <i>Our Town,</i> I have an association...

52:32.784 --> 52:36.221
and I start spinning off on that association,
and I'm having all these internal films.

52:36.354 --> 52:38.356
I'm really supposed to be
just speaking the lines.

52:38.490 --> 52:41.059
So it is going to be —
It's like putting on a girdle.

52:41.193 --> 52:44.029
It's gonna be very, very difficult for me
to do this. I'm very nervous about it.

52:44.162 --> 52:46.932
The little boy playing Wally Webb
over here, Emily's brother...

52:47.065 --> 52:50.168
whose appendix burst in New Hampshire
on a Scout trip — he's 11 years old.

52:50.302 --> 52:54.673
He is not blinking an eye for 40 minutes
while I talk about eternity and say...

52:54.806 --> 52:57.576
"You know as well as I do...

52:57.709 --> 53:01.646
that the dead don't stay interested
in us living for very long.

53:01.780 --> 53:05.550
Gradually, gradually,
they lose hold of the earth...

53:05.684 --> 53:08.753
and the pleasures they had,
and the things they suffered...

53:08.887 --> 53:12.390
and the people they loved,
and the ambitions they had.

53:12.524 --> 53:14.526
They get weaned away
from the earth."

53:14.659 --> 53:17.495
That's the way I put it —
"weaned away."

53:17.629 --> 53:20.332
Except often when you're doing
a long run, you often have...

53:20.465 --> 53:22.901
what I refer to as
a "unifying accident"...

53:23.034 --> 53:26.238
in which something so strange
happens on the stage that it suddenly...

53:26.371 --> 53:28.640
unifies the audience
and the cast in a realization...

53:28.773 --> 53:31.543
that we are only here together
in this one moment, for this show.

53:31.676 --> 53:34.346
It's not television.
It's not a film.

53:34.479 --> 53:38.450
Because of the nature of the accident, we all
know it will never be repeated, most likely.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.685
And somewhere
in the middle of the run, it happens.

53:40.819 --> 53:44.089
I'm turning to the dead, saying,
"They're waiting.

53:44.222 --> 53:46.491
They're waiting for something
they feel is coming.

53:46.625 --> 53:48.894
Something important and great."

53:49.027 --> 53:51.897
And I turn to watch them wait,
and just as I turn...

53:52.030 --> 53:55.400
the little 11-year-old boy
projectile-vomits.

53:57.469 --> 54:01.239
Like a hydrant it comes,
hitting one of the dead on the shoulder.

54:01.373 --> 54:05.543
The other dead levitate around him
out of sheer fear and drop back down.

54:05.677 --> 54:09.147
Frannie Conroy in the front row,
in deep meditative trance, is thinking...

54:09.281 --> 54:11.549
"Why is it raining onstage?"

54:11.683 --> 54:15.253
The little boy flees from his chair,
vomit pouring from his mouth.

54:15.387 --> 54:18.757
Splatter, splatter, splatter!
My knees are shaking.

54:18.890 --> 54:20.692
The chair is empty.

54:20.825 --> 54:23.461
The audience is thunderstruck.

54:23.595 --> 54:25.864
There is not a sound
coming from the audience...

54:25.997 --> 54:29.534
except for one little
ten-year-old boy in the eighth row.

54:29.668 --> 54:32.070
He knows what he saw.

54:34.539 --> 54:36.741
He is laughing!

54:41.012 --> 54:42.781
And I don't know what to do.

54:42.914 --> 54:45.817
I don't know whether to go on
with Thornton Wilder and be loyal to him...

54:45.951 --> 54:47.852
and do the next line as written...

54:47.986 --> 54:50.346
or attempt what might be
one of the most creative improvs...

54:50.455 --> 54:52.390
in the history
of American theater.

54:54.859 --> 54:58.396
And I decide to be loyal to Wilder
and go on with the next line...

54:58.530 --> 55:00.966
and turn to that empty chair and say...

55:02.100 --> 55:06.271
"Aren't they waiting for the eternal part
of them to come out clear?"

55:08.406 --> 55:11.977
When I think of
<i>Monster in a Box...</i>

55:12.110 --> 55:15.280
the film, which is
being released...

55:15.413 --> 55:18.216
any day now...

55:18.350 --> 55:21.186
I have a story that I tell over
and over again that I think I know...

55:21.319 --> 55:23.188
because I've told the story...

55:23.321 --> 55:25.824
and it has to do with how,
at the end —

55:25.957 --> 55:29.627
I talk about when I came home
from Mexico on my vacation...

55:29.761 --> 55:32.497
all I found left about my mother —
'cause she committed suicide...

55:32.630 --> 55:35.600
and had been cremated —
was ashes in an urn...

55:35.734 --> 55:38.103
in a box by my father's bed.

55:38.236 --> 55:41.740
And I'd tell that story over and over
again, and then I suddenly realized...

55:41.873 --> 55:44.376
how long he actually kept
that box by the bed...

55:44.509 --> 55:47.078
before casting
the ashes over the sea...

55:47.212 --> 55:49.748
and what a kind of
loving gesture it was.

55:49.881 --> 55:54.152
And I'd seen it just that —
He wasn't procrastinating or waiting...

55:54.285 --> 55:56.388
but he was actually
living with...

55:56.521 --> 55:58.757
and sleeping
next to those ashes.

55:58.890 --> 56:01.192
And it was just
a very strong, powerful image —

56:01.326 --> 56:03.261
the thought of him alone
with that box at night.

56:03.395 --> 56:06.231
And I never, never really felt it...

56:06.364 --> 56:08.867
or looked into it until I had
spoken it so many times.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.003
And yet the box
in which you put the fragments...

56:12.137 --> 56:16.274
that will contribute to your next work —
is that a monster too?

56:16.408 --> 56:20.278
Yes, and I've only started doing that
with the box since <i>Monster in a Box.</i>

56:20.412 --> 56:22.580
I got a box and put it by my—
It was a new idea...

56:22.714 --> 56:25.984
and I think it grew
out of that, yeah.

56:26.117 --> 56:28.319
Is the monster of those fragments —
is that chaos?

56:28.453 --> 56:31.253
Yes, that's what it is. And of course
it's all about organizing that...

56:31.322 --> 56:34.759
and how frightening that is,
and why any artist is an artist...

56:34.893 --> 56:37.629
and what their main work is to —

56:37.762 --> 56:40.899
Yeah, that chaos is —
Yeah.

56:41.032 --> 56:44.135
I just feel that all the time
when I'm not performing or organizing.

56:44.269 --> 56:47.549
I'm out there in it, but it's what makes
the monologue, so I try to keep a journal.

56:48.706 --> 56:50.942
What next? What to do?

56:51.076 --> 56:52.977
Another monologue.
What else is there to do?

56:53.111 --> 56:55.313
There's always a new crisis,
a new "impingency."

56:55.447 --> 56:58.883
I hoped I wasn't making them up,
creating them just so I'd have material.

57:00.685 --> 57:03.321
The new one was that I was losing
my sight in my left eye.

57:03.455 --> 57:06.791
I certainly hoped I wasn't bringing
that one on myself for material.

57:06.925 --> 57:10.662
And I did a monologue about it
and called it <i>Gray's Anatomy.</i>

57:10.795 --> 57:13.798
<i>Gray's Anatomy</i> was gonna be
a cover story for <i>The New York Times.</i>

57:13.932 --> 57:17.435
I said, "It's not ready." My agent said,
"It's for <i>The New York Times,</i> a cover story."

57:17.569 --> 57:20.738
I said, "It doesn't exist yet."
She said, "Well, make it exist!"

57:20.872 --> 57:23.808
I said, "I don't have a performance until
March." She said, "That's too late. Make it."

57:23.942 --> 57:26.411
<i>So I hired an editor,
John Howell, a friend of mine.</i>

57:26.544 --> 57:28.546
He sat across from me,
and I told him the story.

57:28.680 --> 57:31.249
He was my first audience.
Just like you, it was one-on-one...

57:31.382 --> 57:33.318
but I was telling the story
from an outline.

57:33.451 --> 57:34.886
It's oral composition.

57:35.019 --> 57:37.222
I was about to turn 52...

57:37.355 --> 57:39.524
and clearly I had —

57:39.657 --> 57:41.526
My mom killed herself
when she was 52...

57:41.659 --> 57:44.028
and I had, somewhere in the back
of my mind, thought I was gonna —

57:44.162 --> 57:46.231
in my "un," perhaps —
going to do it too.

57:46.364 --> 57:49.267
Now, I had witnessed
two severe nervous breakdowns...

57:49.400 --> 57:51.603
the second one
ending in her suicide...

57:51.736 --> 57:54.105
so I was very attuned to it...

57:54.239 --> 57:57.876
and was so sure that I was going
to join her either unconsciously...

57:58.009 --> 58:00.345
where I would contract
some disease...

58:00.478 --> 58:04.182
or in an accident,
or maybe just actually do a suicide.

58:04.315 --> 58:08.887
And around this time, what began
to happen was suicide fantasies.

58:09.020 --> 58:12.390
Like films.
I mean, I wasn't manufacturing them.

58:12.524 --> 58:15.160
They were coming into my consciousness,
and I was watching them...

58:15.293 --> 58:17.595
and embracing them as fantasies
and nothing more.

58:17.729 --> 58:22.233
I mean, the first one I remember was,
I was touring Ireland with Renée...

58:22.367 --> 58:26.871
and we went down to the Cliffs of Moher,
those 400-foot-high rock cliffs...

58:27.005 --> 58:30.475
at sunset, you know —
an Irish sunset —

58:30.608 --> 58:33.211
gray sky over gray sea.

58:35.780 --> 58:37.982
Gray observed by Gray.

58:39.250 --> 58:41.319
And I was standing there —
it was cocktail hour —

58:41.452 --> 58:43.855
drinking a can of Guinness Stout,
looking out over —

58:43.988 --> 58:47.959
Most of the tourists had gone.
And this fantasy came to me...

58:48.092 --> 58:52.163
this desire to commit what I would call
a "Roadrunner suicide"...

58:52.297 --> 58:55.400
in which I got back in a field,
and shot by Renée full speed —

58:55.533 --> 58:57.969
beep-beep! voom! —
out over the cliff.

58:58.102 --> 59:01.839
And just before I went down,
I turned and saw her face...

59:01.973 --> 59:05.210
and it was that expression
on her face that I took with me...

59:05.343 --> 59:08.413
as my last vision
to my watery grave.

59:08.546 --> 59:11.516
And as I thought about this,
I couldn't stop crying...

59:11.649 --> 59:14.619
and I could not stop
telling Renée the fantasy...

59:14.752 --> 59:17.088
over and over...

59:17.222 --> 59:19.424
and over again.

59:19.557 --> 59:23.228
Now, around the time I was being
plagued by these silly fantasies...

59:23.361 --> 59:25.763
a very powerful
synchronistic event happened.

59:25.897 --> 59:30.501
Steven Soderbergh, the film director of
<i>Sex, Lies, and Videotape</i> and <i>Kafka...</i>

59:30.635 --> 59:33.571
approached me to be in his new film,
<i>King of the Hill.</i>

59:33.705 --> 59:36.908
And he said he was choosing me
for the particular role of Mr. Mungo...

59:37.041 --> 59:39.143
because he'd read my book
<i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

59:39.277 --> 59:41.813
"What a strange way to cast," I thought.
"From this book!"

59:41.946 --> 59:44.682
And he said the character
in <i>Impossible Vacation —</i>

59:44.816 --> 59:47.785
the "character," right? —
Brewster North —

59:47.919 --> 59:50.388
was clearly ruled by regret...

59:50.521 --> 59:54.158
and the character in his movie,
Mr. Mungo, that he wanted me to play...

59:54.292 --> 59:57.595
was ruled by regret
to the extent that he kills himself.

59:57.729 --> 59:59.597
"Oh, really?"

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.736
"And how does he do that, Steven?"

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:07.372
"Right now
I have him slitting his wrists."

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:09.707
"I'll do it!"

01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:13.544
So here was a chance, I thought,
to work out this fantasy in a creative way...

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:16.614
with a good director.

01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:20.351
I think it's a watershed monologue.
I think the other monologues...

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:23.388
were always about me being the victim
and having the audience be the mother...

01:00:23.521 --> 01:00:25.390
and me crying out,
"Look, look, I'm drowning."

01:00:25.523 --> 01:00:28.693
And also in my relationship
with Renée Shafransky...

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:32.463
which was similar to with the audience,
of always being...

01:00:32.597 --> 01:00:34.732
in need of being nurtured
and mothered.

01:00:34.866 --> 01:00:38.569
And in this monologue, I say...

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:41.372
"Hey, I did this,"
and I take more responsibility.

01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:44.609
My shadow's showing in this.
I mean, I'm not a good guy.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:47.845
Renée knew I had affairs.
She was not happy about it.

01:00:47.979 --> 01:00:51.349
She had some —
not to the degree that I had —

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:55.253
and so I suppose there was
an unspoken relationship —

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:57.922
or we thought we had
this modern relationship where...

01:00:58.056 --> 01:01:01.659
if the affair existed outside there
and didn't come back and haunt us...

01:01:01.793 --> 01:01:04.262
then it was all right.
We kept a distance on it.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:07.498
Also, the other thing was that
we were both so into riding...

01:01:07.632 --> 01:01:09.967
on the magic carpet of my celebrity...

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:13.071
that we just didn't look at the underbelly
of the relationship for a lot of time.

01:01:13.204 --> 01:01:16.708
Things were rolling so fast.

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:19.911
So Kathie — that was breaking
the boundaries...

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:22.914
because I was never supposed
to have one in New York City.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.982
But I had met Kathie on the road,
and she moved to New York.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.752
She moved to Thomas Street
in downtown Manhattan.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.987
Now, the odd thing about that
was I grew up...

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:32.256
near Thomas Street
in Barrington, Rhode Island.

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.525
But I didn't have a girlfriend
when I was 16...

01:01:34.659 --> 01:01:38.329
because I dated my mom
until I was 23.

01:01:38.463 --> 01:01:41.566
So to some extent,
I think I was going back to that.

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:44.402
And I'm not saying I was having
an affair with the street.

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:47.572
I'm saying that people
were becoming like signifiers to me.

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:51.275
It was like I was in a movie,
and I didn't know whose film it was...

01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:55.146
and I was going through the motions,
and it was feeling good but confusing...

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:58.483
and I was approaching 52,
and things were really getting complicated.

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:00.685
Renée wanted to get married again.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.498
"Again" — we'd never been married,
but she was pushing for it again.

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:05.714
And I thought,
"I should be able to give her that gift.

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:08.159
We've been together so many years."
And if I got married...

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.528
that would automatically
end the affair.

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:12.864
But I was so timid about it...

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.900
I had to propose to her
in front of my therapist...

01:02:18.436 --> 01:02:20.705
who knew I was having
an affair with Kathie...

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:23.274
and said nothing about it.

01:02:23.408 --> 01:02:25.777
In fact, I brought Kathie in
to meet him...

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:29.981
and we had a session, and afterward
she went to use his bathroom, and he said...

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:34.285
"She's quite European
in her attitudes.

01:02:34.419 --> 01:02:36.320
She's like a French woman."

01:02:36.454 --> 01:02:40.425
I said, "Well, you dog!
You want to fuck her, don't you?"

01:02:40.558 --> 01:02:42.727
He said, "No, no!"

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.163
And then he had a very bad
countertransference...

01:02:45.296 --> 01:02:47.565
and died of a heart attack
before I could kill him.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.569
I didn't think I could do
another monologue.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:56.674
I pretty much almost cracked up
just before this monologue was —

01:02:56.808 --> 01:02:58.810
Are you serious? Come on.

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.012
Yeah, was told
that I was manic-depressive...

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:05.216
was on Klonopin and lithium
and seeing a top psychopharmacologist —

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:07.485
<i>- Are you serious?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:09.654
I don't know if that monologue
gives a flavor...

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:13.491
of the — of the crack-up.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:15.726
<i>And I —</i>

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.297
Skiing really gave me a sense of balance
in the middle of that crack-up.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.666
<i>But what was the question?</i>

01:03:21.799 --> 01:03:23.935
What didn't you tell us
we might want to know?

01:03:24.068 --> 01:03:27.672
Oh, my God! That was in the therapist's
office. That's what helped me through.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.674
I had a very good...

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:32.743
woman therapist that —

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:36.714
I laid out the stuff. I laid out
my shadow in her lap, as it were...

01:03:36.848 --> 01:03:40.451
and we began to figure out
what was public and what was private.

01:03:40.585 --> 01:03:42.954
When Kathie told me she was pregnant,
I fell down on the floor...

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.089
and went into a fetal position...

01:03:45.223 --> 01:03:47.391
and when I got up, I said...

01:03:47.525 --> 01:03:51.028
"Get rid of it. Get rid of it."

01:03:51.162 --> 01:03:53.030
And she said, "Not so fast.

01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:55.500
This is my body.
I have to think about it.

01:03:55.633 --> 01:03:58.936
If I have this child, I will raise it.
I will be committed to it."

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.772
And I got out of there,
and I went out on tour...

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:05.843
and I sent her money for an abortion,
and I called her and sent her letters...

01:04:05.977 --> 01:04:09.747
and on September 27, 1992...

01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:12.083
Kathie gave birth to a son...

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:16.420
and named him
Forrest Dylan Gray.

01:04:16.554 --> 01:04:19.490
This was extremely traumatic.

01:04:19.624 --> 01:04:22.193
Renée cried. I cried.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:25.663
Kathie cried. Forrest cried.

01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:29.066
And Renée requested me...

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.237
not to see this child until there was
some reconciliation between us...

01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:36.274
and I couldn't deal with any of it
and went out on tour.

01:04:36.407 --> 01:04:38.409
And out there,
I got more and more agoraphobic...

01:04:38.543 --> 01:04:40.411
and wasn't going out of my hotel...

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:43.314
and Renée called and said,
"You've got to come back.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:47.952
I've seen the baby in a snuggly in Kathie's
arms, and I am in bed, devastated."

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.288
And I said,
"You've got to give me a day."

01:04:50.421 --> 01:04:52.990
And she said, "If you take a day,
I won't be here for you."

01:04:53.124 --> 01:04:55.393
I took two days.
I took two days...

01:04:55.526 --> 01:04:57.962
because I couldn't even find myself...

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.531
to walk out of the hotel,
I was so split...

01:05:00.665 --> 01:05:03.634
with an image of myself
sitting on the bed, comforting Renée...

01:05:03.768 --> 01:05:05.937
and an image of myself
standing next to Kathie...

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.339
meeting my son for the first time.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:10.875
And the split was so great,
it took three people...

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:13.311
to get me out
to the San Francisco airport...

01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:15.313
jerking and barking all the way.

01:05:15.446 --> 01:05:18.349
This time, the captain
of the American Airlines came out.

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:22.153
My friend talked to him, and the captain said,
"I don't care who he is.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:25.623
Do you know what it costs
to land this plane in Kansas?"

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:30.595
And somehow —
and I don't know how Bill did this —

01:05:30.728 --> 01:05:35.299
he convinced the captain I was rehearsing
for a psychotic role in a Scorsese movie.

01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:39.770
And Renée said,
"This is it. I can't —

01:05:39.904 --> 01:05:44.709
I have to draw a boundary here.
I'm moving out with a friend for a while."

01:05:44.842 --> 01:05:47.678
And when she left the loft...

01:05:47.812 --> 01:05:49.814
she took the feeling with her.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:52.650
There was no heart left in that room.

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:55.686
I turned to stone.
I turned to a dead thing.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.888
And I had not realized
for 14 years...

01:05:58.022 --> 01:06:00.958
Renée had been filling
the room with the feeling.

01:06:01.092 --> 01:06:03.961
And I took a bottle of vodka
and knocked down a few shots...

01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:06.197
and began to feel my breath
and thought...

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.566
"What do I want to do?"

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:12.236
And I thought,
"I would like to see my son.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.405
He's eight months old.
I've never seen him."

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:17.808
And I called Kathie and I said,
"I'm coming down."

01:06:17.942 --> 01:06:20.344
And I came down,
and she took him out of the crib...

01:06:20.478 --> 01:06:22.847
and he went right for her breast...

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.916
and I knew there was
no need for a blood test.

01:06:28.786 --> 01:06:32.723
I saw the shape of my father's head
in the back of his head.

01:06:32.857 --> 01:06:35.826
I saw my brother Rocky's eyes
in his eyes.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.697
I saw a distant mirror.
I saw a little lust flower.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.033
I saw a completely formed
human being.

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:45.403
I saw a glorious accident.

01:06:45.536 --> 01:06:48.773
And I had a perfect paradox
at that moment, where I thought...

01:06:48.906 --> 01:06:51.976
"Now you can die,
and you <i>must</i> stay alive...

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.978
to help this little guy through."

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:57.148
My dad died three days
after I saw my son...

01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:59.283
not knowing he had
his first grandson.

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:01.318
I didn't even know
my father was dying.

01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:04.488
My stepmother didn't call
to tell me he was in the hospital...

01:07:04.622 --> 01:07:06.957
she was so angry with me
at the way I portrayed her...

01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:10.061
in my book <i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:13.764
Sorry you can't stick around
and spend a little time here.

01:07:13.898 --> 01:07:15.933
Yeah. As always...

01:07:16.067 --> 01:07:18.436
I'm off on another toot.

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:23.708
- Back to Boston?
- Yeah. You should come up.

01:07:23.841 --> 01:07:27.078
Well, maybe we will.
Except for the traffic.

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:29.680
Right. I hope we don't hit it.

01:07:29.814 --> 01:07:33.751
But I don't know when —
next time we'll see each other.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:36.153
Well, you're going
to Florida at Christmas.

01:07:36.287 --> 01:07:40.558
Yeah, and then
to Australia on January 11.

01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:43.227
So we won't see you again
till probably March, hmm?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.696
- Uh, April, more like.
- April.

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:48.232
Are you going up to the house
in the mountains in April?

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.968
- I think I'm gonna try to sell that house.
- Oh, are you?

01:07:51.102 --> 01:07:52.970
What are you going to do
about the foundation?

01:07:53.104 --> 01:07:56.173
Try to sell it. They say
there's a sucker born every minute...

01:07:56.307 --> 01:07:58.642
and if there is,
I'll let them take it over.

01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:01.011
We want to get a house
out in the Hamptons...

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:04.482
believe it or not,
closer to the water.

01:08:04.615 --> 01:08:06.935
What's it like being a dad?
How has that changed your life?

01:08:07.017 --> 01:08:10.121
Being a dad is fantastic.
It's very grounding, very connecting.

01:08:10.254 --> 01:08:13.124
And it's got me out of myself, because
believe me — and you must know this...

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:17.027
and everyone that has children knows it —
their needs are bigger than yours...

01:08:17.161 --> 01:08:19.697
and they are so obviously bigger.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.166
<i>- That's right.</i>
- It really relativizes yours.

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:24.419
You talked about your dad
in the excerpt a moment ago.

01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:26.770
What did you learn from your dad
about raising kids?

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:29.673
It's all been learned now,
after his death, I'm sad to say...

01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:33.511
'cause I'm a father late in life,
and I'd love to thank him...

01:08:33.644 --> 01:08:36.613
for what he went through with us,
his three boys.

01:08:36.747 --> 01:08:38.883
And I've learned
to appreciate him in absence.

01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:04.608
Yeah!

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.095
Yeah!

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:26.964
<i>- That's great!</i>
- Stick your foot out.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.666
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:31.038
So the new monologue is called
<i>Morning, Noon and Night...</i>

01:09:31.068 --> 01:09:33.970
and it's about my life living
with the family here in this house.

01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:36.774
<i>And of course, my fear is that
once I tell the story...</i>

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:39.443
<i>or organize the chaos
about the family...</i>

01:09:39.577 --> 01:09:42.078
<i>I'll be looking for the next story,
which means I'll have to leave the family.</i>

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:44.215
<i>So that's the risk of the work.</i>

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:47.451
And when she moved to New York City
with her daughter, Marissa —

01:09:47.585 --> 01:09:51.188
and Marissa was three —
I continued to meet her there.

01:09:51.322 --> 01:09:55.392
And I first met Marissa at a party
in downtown New York City.

01:09:55.526 --> 01:09:59.563
And Marissa had a sense that
the name Spalding Gray existed...

01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:03.234
because I'd call the loft a lot
to talk with Kathie...

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:05.703
but she could never get her imagination
around "Spalding Gray"...

01:10:05.836 --> 01:10:08.939
so she referred to me as
"Splendid Café"...

01:10:11.008 --> 01:10:15.145
which I thought was a great stage name
if I ever needed one.

01:10:15.279 --> 01:10:18.549
I think we're going to get away
with this one story about the family.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:20.722
I wouldn't want to turn it
into <i>Ozzie and Harriet...</i>

01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:23.921
and make an ongoing soap opera,
because the children would then be...

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.857
minor heroes
before they were greater people.

01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:30.127
We move into the house,
and new life comes.

01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:32.696
Kathie gets pregnant.

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.833
How did this happen?

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.902
"I don't think I want this child.

01:10:38.035 --> 01:10:41.906
I'm content now with our new home
and the family configuration as it is"...

01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:45.609
I told my therapist.

01:10:45.743 --> 01:10:49.713
Kathie's sure it's gonna be a girl.
She's convinced me it's gonna be a girl.

01:10:49.847 --> 01:10:52.149
We're gonna name her
Eliza Ann Gray.

01:10:52.283 --> 01:10:55.819
Eleven hours into labor here,
the storm is still raging.

01:10:55.953 --> 01:10:59.490
It's the next day, and Kathie
can only find one comfortable position.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.926
She's on all fours,
like a wild animal.

01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:04.795
The nurses are not approving.
I know it's not Northern California.

01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:09.166
I'm trying to get the hermetically sealed
window open to get a little air in there.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.735
Marissa's dozing in the corner
with her little camera...

01:11:11.869 --> 01:11:14.738
and all of a sudden,
it starts to come.

01:11:14.872 --> 01:11:18.642
And I just have time to get on
my scrubs and roll Kathie over.

01:11:18.776 --> 01:11:21.679
I'm helping. I'm pushing one knee back.
The other nurse has the other knee...

01:11:21.812 --> 01:11:25.683
and I look down and —
Oh, my God!

01:11:25.816 --> 01:11:29.286
It looks like she's giving birth
to a dead beaver!

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:34.191
"What is that hairy blue football...

01:11:34.325 --> 01:11:36.493
and how is it gonna fit
through that —"

01:11:36.627 --> 01:11:38.562
Pow! And it's out!
And I go...

01:11:38.696 --> 01:11:41.799
"Whoa!
Look at the balls on that girl!"

01:11:46.804 --> 01:11:49.940
And I lean over
and kiss Kathie and cry...

01:11:50.074 --> 01:11:54.111
and bend down and cut the umbilical cord,
and the crimson blood flies...

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:58.282
and I look down
at this glorious accident, Theo.

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.517
We just grabbed that name out the air
in case it was a boy.

01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:03.654
"Theo," short for nothing.

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.789
Short for "the study of God."

01:12:05.923 --> 01:12:07.958
Theo Spalding Gray.

01:12:08.092 --> 01:12:12.930
And back at me is coming this totally
perplexed face with the big "Why?"

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:14.932
"Why this?

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.201
Why something and not nothing?"

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:20.637
And I totally identify with it.
And I know that he's not mirroring me.

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:23.774
He hasn't been in the world
long enough to pick up on my face.

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:26.076
He's brought this in with him.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:29.646
And I think, "Oh, little one,
you may have already spent...

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:33.050
the best days of your life...

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:37.788
in there."

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.759
I think of poetic journalism
as telling a relatively true story..

01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:45.696
but after you've digested it, filtered it
through your own imagination...

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:49.566
and then tell it with poetry,
with flavor...

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.636
with innuendo,
with hyperbole...

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:56.240
so that it starts
as a true story...

01:12:56.373 --> 01:13:00.411
but it's filtered
through my imagination.

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:03.647
So at its best, it comes out
as a form of poetry.

01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:06.550
Forrest came to me very early on
with questions about death.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:09.787
He wasn't even four.
And I just was very honest with him.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.956
I said, "You know,
everyone that comes in has to go out.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:15.926
That's just the whole rule of it.
That's how it goes.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:20.064
And it's probably, in a way, comforting.
It's the only thing we really know.

01:13:20.197 --> 01:13:22.877
And the funny thing, Forrest,
about death is — or not funny, really,

01:13:22.933 --> 01:13:24.802
because I don't think there's
anything funny about death —

01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:27.805
but the odd thing is,
is that, you know...

01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:30.074
everyone knows
they're going to die...

01:13:30.207 --> 01:13:34.178
but no one really <i>believes</i> it."

01:13:34.311 --> 01:13:37.347
All of my life — Or so many of us
were brought up with the idea...

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:39.917
of the ethereal-ness of death...

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:44.088
and you're going to go off
into the vapors and to heaven.

01:13:44.221 --> 01:13:46.256
And I think that we return
to the elements...

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:51.061
and that age is a great pain
but also a great comfort.

01:13:51.195 --> 01:13:53.730
It's a great paradox,
because the older I get...

01:13:53.864 --> 01:13:56.333
the more weight I feel
and the more aware of gravity.

01:13:56.467 --> 01:13:58.335
You know, I only live once.

01:13:58.469 --> 01:14:00.971
I'm sure the configuration
of Spalding Gray...

01:14:01.105 --> 01:14:04.641
there's only room for it one time around,
so I know I won't be reincarnated.

01:14:04.775 --> 01:14:07.544
One of the ways
to reincarnate is to tell your story.

01:14:07.678 --> 01:14:10.247
And I get enormous pleasure from that.
It's like coming back.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.883
They're probably gonna go in
and play in front of the fire...

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:15.185
and put music on, maybe.

01:14:15.319 --> 01:14:19.189
If Marissa wins, and she usually does,
it'll be Spice Girls.

01:14:19.323 --> 01:14:21.523
If Forrest gets his way, it'll be Hanson.

01:14:21.592 --> 01:14:23.494
Kathie and I are gonna just
hang out here a little more...

01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.696
and have more chardonnay
with Theo and relax.

01:14:25.829 --> 01:14:29.433
"Keep it down in there.
Please keep it down."

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.635
Sounds like a compromise, huh?

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:33.637
I don't know what they chose.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:37.274
What is it?

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.878
♪ We'll be singin' ♪

01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.882
- ♪ I get knocked down, but I get up again ♪
- Wow!

01:14:45.015 --> 01:14:47.584
Hey! It's Chumbawamba!

01:14:47.718 --> 01:14:50.621
I can't resist. Pumpin' out.

01:14:50.754 --> 01:14:54.057
- Whoo!

01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:57.394

01:14:57.528 --> 01:15:00.797
Wow! Hey! Whoo!

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:04.268
Marissa's doing ballet leaps
across the living room floor.

01:15:04.401 --> 01:15:07.037
Forrest enters,
twirling like a dervish.

01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:11.008
Theo comes in and starts doing pliés
on the wingback chair.

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:17.548
Kathie enters,
walkin' like an Egyptian.

01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:23.787
♪ Oh, Danny boy, Danny boy ♪

01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:27.791
Hey, we're dancing. The whole family's

01:15:54.184 --> 01:15:56.520
And we all go downtown
for ice cream.

01:15:56.653 --> 01:16:00.791
I always felt that I would always be
publicly talking about something...

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.924
and I never know what
the next thing is gonna be...

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:06.063
but I suspect that
as long as I have a voice...

01:16:06.196 --> 01:16:08.932
there will be a story, you know?

01:16:11.268 --> 01:16:13.637
This is a great entrance.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.872
Boy, we had so much —

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:19.409
It was hard to film at Robbie's with
all the planes, and they're over here too.

01:16:19.543 --> 01:16:23.013
But I now know how to get up the steps.
I'm able to jump steps, so —

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:26.550
- That's an acquired skill.
- It's a new breakthrough for me. Yeah.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:29.086
So I've gotten
to this real stationary place...

01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:31.622
where I don't have to do anything...

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:34.524
and people wait on me,
and I just observe.

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:37.294
I feel like a real outsider...

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:39.529
kind of like I'm half dead.

01:16:44.134 --> 01:16:46.236
In a funny way, it's a treat...

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.243
just to be a witness.

01:16:53.377 --> 01:16:55.579
I don't want to see the ocean.

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:58.282
'Cause the last thing I picture myself was,
I was Boogie-boarding in June...

01:16:58.415 --> 01:17:02.452
and I said, "I don't want to leave here.
I don't want to go to Ireland.

01:17:02.586 --> 01:17:05.389
I'm riding the waves with Forrest,
and this is great.

01:17:05.522 --> 01:17:07.357
You know, my life is good."

01:17:07.491 --> 01:17:10.627
And I said, "The past five years
have been the best five years of my life."

01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:13.563
<i>- And then boom.</i>
- And then it happened like that.

01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:15.999
<i>- When did it happen, anyway?</i>
- June 23rd.

01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:19.770
<i>- When did you guys arrive in Ireland?</i>
- The day before, the 21st.

01:17:19.903 --> 01:17:22.906
Yeah, we celebrated
the longest day there...

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.208
and Kathie and I had
the master bedroom...

01:17:25.342 --> 01:17:27.811
and we had
one great, erotic night...

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:31.214
and the next day, end of story.

01:17:31.348 --> 01:17:33.016
End of story line.

01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:35.018
<i>You were coming back from dinner
from your birthday?</i>

01:17:35.152 --> 01:17:38.288
From a restaurant.
We were one mile from home.

01:17:38.422 --> 01:17:40.957
And, um...

01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:44.294
<i>And you guys were just in the car, and you
came around a curve and you got hit?</i>

01:17:44.428 --> 01:17:47.764
No, he came around a curve.
Kathie slowed to stop to turn...

01:17:47.898 --> 01:17:50.734
and this van came hurtling
right into her.

01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:53.770
I don't think he even broke.
I could see it coming.

01:17:53.904 --> 01:17:57.774
It looked like a video game,
like I was playing a video game.

01:17:57.908 --> 01:17:59.776
You just can't accept it.

01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:02.479
And then... huge crash.

01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:05.782
And the car just — Our car spun around.
He pushed it around.

01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:08.685
The next thing, I was lying
in the road in a puddle of blood...

01:18:08.819 --> 01:18:11.121
and there was this woman
nursing me.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:14.958
She was the Good Samaritan. Somehow —
She lived in the neighborhood...

01:18:15.092 --> 01:18:16.860
and heard Tara screaming...

01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:20.464
and she lost her nine-year-old son
there a year ago.

01:18:20.597 --> 01:18:23.934
<i>- In a car accident?</i>
- He fell out of the car.

01:18:24.067 --> 01:18:27.270
The car skidded,
and he was almost decapitated.

01:18:27.404 --> 01:18:30.474
And I was her son, in a way.
She kept talking me down...

01:18:30.607 --> 01:18:32.776
and nursing me and saying,
"You're gonna be all right."

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:35.229
And I couldn't see out of this eye,
which is my good eye...

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:37.280
'cause there was so much blood.

01:18:37.414 --> 01:18:40.784
So I couldn't see past the blood.
And there was all this...

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:44.020
they told me, cow medicine
everywhere, and the weird thing —

01:18:44.154 --> 01:18:46.523
<i>- Cow medicine?</i>
- Because it was a veterinarian that hit us.

01:18:46.656 --> 01:18:48.692
And the weird thing was
just earlier in the day...

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:51.795
I saw a very sick calf
that couldn't get up...

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:55.065
'cause its leg was —
Something was wrong with its hip.

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:57.667
And I went to a farmer, I said,
"That cow should be...

01:18:57.801 --> 01:18:59.669
put out of its misery
or taken care of."

01:18:59.803 --> 01:19:01.805
And the guy said, "Yeah, I know.
We're gonna call a vet."

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:04.207
So my fantasy is that I set it up.

01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:07.911
It's hard to be relative and hard to —
I mean, when I was complaining...

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:11.381
to a nurse one day, she said, "Shall I
take you to the spinal ward, then?"

01:19:11.515 --> 01:19:15.285
You know? In a way, that sobered me up
and made me thankful...

01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:19.556
and in another way, I was annoyed that
she's not honoring the place that I'm in.

01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:23.827
I never thought I'd want to rush back
from Ireland to have head surgery...

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.431
but there's some reconstruction of my skull
that will have to be done next week.

01:19:27.564 --> 01:19:30.066
So now I've got another comparison...

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.136
of New York hospitals versus Irish ones,
so who knows what it's about?

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.006
But I think there's enormous
amounts of material there...

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:39.276
that, once processed,
will be something.

01:19:39.409 --> 01:19:41.878
<i>- You have everything you need?</i>
- I think so.

01:19:42.012 --> 01:19:44.347
Want to bring
the cards over, Marissa?

01:19:52.222 --> 01:19:54.524
Hi. Come on over.

01:19:54.658 --> 01:19:56.293
- Are you ushering?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:19:56.426 --> 01:19:58.195
Okay.

01:19:58.328 --> 01:20:00.664
Does that mean
you get to watch the show?

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:06.670
<i>Would you be interested
in being interviewed tonight?</i>

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:09.105
Um, I'm not up to it tonight, no.

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.107
<i>What's that? I can't hear you.
Come on over.</i>

01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:14.344
No, actually, I'm not feeling
too great tonight, so —

01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:16.513
- You're what?
- I'm not feeling too great tonight.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.849
- Oh, I know the feeling.
- How are you, by the way?

01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:21.351
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

01:20:21.485 --> 01:20:23.920
I woke up and —
I actually woke up — I didn't sleep.

01:20:24.054 --> 01:20:27.023
Oh, you didn't sleep.
I didn't last night either.

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:29.025
No. I, uh —
It was one of those.

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.595
- Yeah? It's hard.
- How are you, by the way?

01:20:31.728 --> 01:20:34.998
Oh, so-so.
I'm coming along.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:37.834
- I had a few of those.
- Oh, you did?

01:20:37.968 --> 01:20:40.770
Accidents?
You had a few accidents?

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.846
I'm going onstage now.
Going backstage.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:53.149
Are we going to watch?

01:20:53.283 --> 01:20:56.253
- Yeah. Where's Mom?
- Can I watch you?

01:20:56.386 --> 01:20:59.222
You can watch
from the audience.

01:21:06.663 --> 01:21:11.401
Many people asked me
about the crutches...

01:21:11.535 --> 01:21:15.772
and some people had heard
about this, uh, accident —

01:21:15.906 --> 01:21:19.476
which I hope that that's all it was,
was an accident.

01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:22.012
So I'd like to begin, if I could...

01:21:22.145 --> 01:21:25.215
if you don't mind being an opener...

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.717
and you can come right up
this center stage here.

01:21:28.952 --> 01:21:31.655
And I'm not even going
to say your name...

01:21:31.788 --> 01:21:34.824
'cause I know you want to be anonymous.

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:38.128
<i>There's one Irish nurse that stuck
with me in that St. James Hospital...</i>

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:40.664
<i>that I'll never forget
named Carmella.</i>

01:21:40.797 --> 01:21:43.967
<i>Irish nurses stand for 12 hours.
I kept telling her to sit down.</i>

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.703
She said, "We're trained
to stand for 12 hours at a time."

01:21:46.836 --> 01:21:49.506
She stands at attention
by my wheelchair, you know?

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:52.409
And I'm just going crazy
from just boredom...

01:21:52.542 --> 01:21:55.345
and so I start to interview her,
and I said, "Carmella...

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:58.748
how do you —
Do you go to church?"

01:21:58.882 --> 01:22:02.118
"Oh, no, no.
I'm not real keen on the Catholic Church."

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:05.221
- "Why?"
- "With their stand on abortion and all."

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:07.891
And I said,
"Well, aren't you afraid of dying, then?

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:10.260
Because you won't have the priest there
to do the Holy Communion...

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.395
and if you're not going to Mass —"

01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:15.398
She said, "Ah, no.
I'm not afraid of death...

01:22:15.532 --> 01:22:18.802
because the only sin
is hurtin' someone...

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:21.071
and I haven't done that."

01:22:21.204 --> 01:22:24.274
And I looked at her and I knew...

01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:26.276
- she hadn't.
- Wow.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:29.613
- And it was startling. Startling.
- Wow.

01:22:29.746 --> 01:22:33.717
- 'Cause I sure couldn't do it, couldn't say—
- What are you worried about?

01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:37.454
The next accident, because I —

01:22:37.587 --> 01:22:40.457
Fuck it all!
I know this one isn't clearing the air.

01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:44.294
The next plane crash,
getting home from here.

01:22:44.427 --> 01:22:47.664
<i>When I was in Ireland, the first thing I did
when we were in that country home...</i>

01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:50.100
was to climb this hill
to look out over...

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:54.704
the whole of the countryside
of Westmeath.

01:22:54.838 --> 01:22:59.109
And fields and fields and fields
and fields and farmyards —

01:22:59.242 --> 01:23:01.277
"No water" was the first thing that —

01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:03.580
- My eye went for that.
<i>- For the water?</i>

01:23:03.713 --> 01:23:08.485
Yeah. Wherever I am, I'm setting up
myself by direction of water.

01:23:08.618 --> 01:23:13.623
<i>So would you be able to help me
with this rooting issue?</i>

01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:15.659
What did you call it?

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:19.729
This issue of not feeling
you can stay in one place?

01:23:19.863 --> 01:23:23.800
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

01:23:23.933 --> 01:23:26.269
I'm not sure
if it isn't a hopeless case.

01:23:28.405 --> 01:23:31.875
<i>We've been out here five years,
my family and I.</i>

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:34.811
<i>- Kathie and the three children.</i>
- How do you like it?

01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:38.114
I have problems with it
in the winter.

01:23:38.248 --> 01:23:41.184
Um, it's not New Age enough for me.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.990
I'm very attracted
to alternative therapies...

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:50.226
and-and diet...

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.064
and I think I drink too much out here.

01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:57.267
It's a drinking culture.
Either everyone drinks or no one drinks.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.637
People say that it has to do with the sea —
the mother, the sea.

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:03.673
The sea is your mother.
You must know that one.

01:24:03.807 --> 01:24:06.743
And that a way to get to the mother
is through inebriation.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.112
<i>I mean —</i>

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:12.582
When I drink, I feel like
I'm coming closer to the mother.

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.720
That-That old thing of when you're stuck
on the breast, that great —

01:24:16.853 --> 01:24:20.490
That, you know — that bliss.

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.560
<i>Do you have anything
you want to ask me?</i>

01:24:23.693 --> 01:24:27.564
Um, what are your thoughts
on the meaning of life?

01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:34.070
Well, now that you ask —

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:40.577
I'm not —
Well, I don't believe in fate.

01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:45.982
I'm rather a chaos person.

01:24:46.116 --> 01:24:48.885
There's a series of interviews out...

01:24:49.018 --> 01:24:53.089
with different philosophers,
and it's called <i>The Glorious Accident.</i>

01:24:53.223 --> 01:24:55.492
Consciousness.
The definition of consciousness.

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:58.862
<i>The Glorious Accident.</i>
So that's kind of my take on life —

01:24:58.995 --> 01:25:01.498
"the glorious accident" —
although my accident was —

01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:03.600
- Not too glorious.
- Yeah.

01:25:03.733 --> 01:25:05.869
Up until now,
I'd said that I've always felt...

01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:08.404
that I was
an embracer of accidents...

01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:10.740
'cause my life has been...

01:25:10.874 --> 01:25:13.309
serendipity and accident
and not a lot of planning.

01:25:14.644 --> 01:25:17.580
Thank you for coming.

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.600
I was always worried that my epitaph,
which I will never see, will read...

01:25:37.734 --> 01:25:40.170
"Spalding Gray,
who found a niche of talking —

01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:42.906
making a living of talking about himself."

01:25:43.039 --> 01:25:46.976
And the dog is already howling
for the dead Spalding Gray.

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:51.014
And I would hope that it would say,
"Talking about himself...

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:54.284
and his loved ones
and people he's encountered...

01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:56.986
in his travels."

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.056
You know?
I mean, I am not Samuel Beckett.

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:02.058
I'm not a navel-gazer.

01:26:02.192 --> 01:26:04.527
Beckett's a great writer,
but I'm not a minimalist in that way.

01:26:04.661 --> 01:26:07.197
I'm talking about the world as I see it.

01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:21.244
God, that's just wild.
It's like Chekhov.

01:26:24.047 --> 01:26:26.983
It's become a great sound effect.

01:26:29.719 --> 01:26:31.754
I'll think of that at night.

01:26:34.724 --> 01:26:36.926
It's a lamentation.
