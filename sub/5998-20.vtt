00:13.748 --> 00:15.314

Gabriela Dawson, my--

01:00.728 --> 01:02.094
- Girlfriend.
Hi.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.328
I researched the campaign.

01:03.330 --> 01:07.399

standing beside him.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.069

for me to run.

- Oh, smart girl.
- Did I miss the pitch?

01:12.073 --> 01:14.173
- No, but I'll take that
as my cue.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.309
I've worked on 18 campaigns,
had 18 candidates elected.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.711
People tend to think that my
trick is great campaigning,

01:19.713 --> 01:22.181

pick the right horse.

your confidence,

but nothing's official

01:38.632 --> 01:40.199

something here.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.337
What exactly would he be
campaigning for?

01:45.339 --> 01:46.772

01:46.774 --> 01:50.709
Senate, mayor.

at school,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.272

like the perfect excuse

10:51.418 --> 10:54.886
I've got an important
announcement to make.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.255
All of us here will be
traveling next month

10:57.257 --> 11:00.759
to the annual firefighting
and leadership conference in--

11:00.761 --> 11:04.729
wait for it...

11:04.731 --> 11:05.997
Las Vegas.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.033
- Hey, nice.
- Right?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.134
- What are you talking about?

11:09.136 --> 11:12.671
We got, uh--
we got three days in Vegas.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.239
Um, we're going to throw in
a few training seminars

11:14.241 --> 11:15.340
just to balance it out.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.374
Who's in?
Who's in?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.742
All you got to do is say yes.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.144
- Yes.
- Yes!

11:19.146 --> 11:21.446
- I don't know what you did
to swing this, Otis,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.148
but count me in.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.282
- Hey, all you got to do

11:24.284 --> 11:26.151
is sign your name
to the list.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.687
Otis is going
to take care of the rest.

11:28.689 --> 11:29.988
Here you go.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.058
- All right.
We'll collect payment later.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.993
- Payment?

11:34.995 --> 11:38.029
I thought you had arranged it.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.431
- Yeah, I mean, it'll cost us.

11:39.433 --> 11:43.334
- So what exactly
did you arrange?

11:44.904 --> 11:46.404
- The sign-up list.
Come on, guys.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.007
Hey, it's the trip
of a lifetime!

11:49.009 --> 11:50.975
You only live once.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.781
- I was a paramedic first,

11:56.783 --> 11:59.984
and then I thought
I would want to be a doctor,

11:59.986 --> 12:02.153
but I don't know.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.890
Sometimes who you are
sneaks up on you.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.727
Finds you and sinks
its teeth in.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.830
<i>[sirens wailing in distance]</i>

12:22.241 --> 12:25.777
Okay.
What's next?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.513
- Why is firefighting
so important?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.284
- What's going on?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.320
- Detective Holloway's
been shot.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.255
They're prepping her for surgery
now at Med.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.389
- What happened?

12:38.391 --> 12:39.524
- We believe the shooter
was stationed

12:39.526 --> 12:42.527
As soon as Holloway
pulled up, shots were fired.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.429
- It was a hit?
- Yes.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.930
- She said you guys
cleared the threat.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.465
That things had calmed down.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.768
- We thought so.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.770
- I'll get J.J.
I'll take him to Med.

12:51.772 --> 12:52.871
- No, you can't.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.906
For now, Chicago Med's
on lockdown.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.241
This guy had
a getaway car waiting.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.876
He's in the wind.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.178
He finds out he didn't finish
the job, he might come back.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.380
I can't let J.J.
anywhere near Med.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.883
- Officer John Lucas.
I'm with peer support.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.551
I contacted Holloway's
emergency contact,

13:06.553 --> 13:10.355
With the circumstances,
she asked that we not tell J.J.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.323
what happened until
after she arrives.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.491
- What do we do
in the meantime?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.959
- I'll take J.J.
for the day--

13:14.961 --> 13:17.295
go to a movie,
get some lunch, keep him busy.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.397
- No, that kid's a smart kid.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
As soon as you take him
away from here,

13:20.567 --> 13:24.335
He's been hanging out in here
for three shifts.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.504
I know him.
He trusts me.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.009
- We'll have
to provide protection.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.077
Squad cars can be
stationed out front.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.447
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

13:41.020 --> 13:43.421
- So J.J.'s aunt really didn't
want us to tell him anything?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.924
- Yeah, she's about
six hours out.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.559
- Six hours.
All right.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.061
Well, that's plenty of time
to make the best damn video

13:50.063 --> 13:51.296
that this third grade's
ever seen,

13:51.298 --> 13:55.099
so if we're not out on call
or doing drills,

13:55.101 --> 13:56.901
we should all be
on J.J. duty.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.003
We can give this kid
a good day.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.111
- Chief, I can't leave
the firehouse today.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.147
- I've got Connie calling
for a relief, Lieutenant.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.483
She'll be here soon.
- Thank you.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.053
- She'll be all right.
- Yeah.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.988
Yeah.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.027
- You wanted to see me,
Chief?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.630
- Yeah, come on in.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.333
Just had a phone call
from a Liz Brexel--

14:28.335 --> 14:30.034
woman from the art gallery.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.436
- How's Armand?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.204
- He's gonna be fine,

14:33.206 --> 14:35.039
but Liz is asking for the names
of the firefighters

14:35.041 --> 14:38.343
who pulled him out,
and she is being insistent.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.510
I've pushed her off for now,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.079
but you have got to know

14:41.081 --> 14:43.581
this might come back.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.583
Those extra minutes
we spent outside

14:45.585 --> 14:47.986
we could've spent
attacking that fire.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.124
Severide's already spoken to you
about this call, right?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.660
- Yes.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.096
- You don't need
to hear it from me.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.434
Cruz.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.336
There are two kinds of mistakes.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.305
There is the inevitable,
and then there are the ones

15:07.307 --> 15:10.475
that you could have
just avoided.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.211
Listening to orders--

15:13.213 --> 15:14.979
that stops the latter.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.122
that the Firefighting
and Leadership Conference board

15:24.124 --> 15:26.691
have agreed to let teach
a four-hour seminar

15:26.693 --> 15:29.527
called "Lead From the Front,"

15:29.529 --> 15:32.430
which'll give us free passes
to the conference

15:32.432 --> 15:35.066
and free meals for three days.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.502
- So we're still paying
for most of the trip,

15:37.504 --> 15:41.105
and now we're working?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.340
- I like the name.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.641
- Oh, thanks, man.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.950
- Hey, Otis, did you ever hear
any follow-up from Dr. Halstead?

15:51.952 --> 15:55.119
- Why would I hear a follow-up?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.321
- It's normal.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.056
Doctors call back to check
how you're doing.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.624
- Yeah, but like I told you,
it wasn't anything,

15:59.626 --> 16:02.393
so why would
I need a follow-up?

16:12.371 --> 16:14.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.606
- Why were there cops here?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.442
- Uh, just checking in.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.444
We're helping them out
with a case.

16:19.446 --> 16:24.015
- Okay, so who's next?

16:24.017 --> 16:27.151
- When did I fall in love
with this job?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.053
Before I was even doing it.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.589
When I was a kid, we had
firefighters come to our school.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.758
They came with all the gear,
the truck.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.362
They even let us climb up top,
and, yeah, I knew right then.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.098
- I'm proud of what I do,

16:40.100 --> 16:43.634
of this job.
of the people.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.636
There is no more honorable way
to spend your life.

16:45.638 --> 16:50.008
- Sometimes when you help
somebody else,

16:50.010 --> 16:51.209
you help yourself too.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.111
- Huh.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.117
Um...

16:59.119 --> 17:00.651
- Is there anyone else
I can talk to?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.220
- Yeah. Capp, beat it.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.755
- I haven't answered yet.
- Beat it.

17:03.757 --> 17:08.459
Brett, please.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.362
- Could we call my mom first?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.298
- Uh, she's--she's really busy
right now, bud.

17:14.300 --> 17:18.336
- Can we just try her?
She always answers when I call.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.746
- Yes.
Couple hours after that.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.382
- Who would you suspect
of bribery?

21:58.384 --> 22:00.818
- There was a name on the box:
Cartman Development.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.521
- I know.
Anybody else?

22:03.523 --> 22:04.822
No one's approached you yet?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.991
- I'm sorry, Al,
you don't need to sit.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.727
I'm actually
on shift right now.

22:09.729 --> 22:10.928
It'd be more appropriate

22:10.930 --> 22:13.631
to deal with this
during my office hours,

22:13.633 --> 22:15.399
or you can contact the CPD.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.101
I already gave them
all this information.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.869
- Of course.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.072
The CPD.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.907
I'll contact them
straight away.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.546
- What made you want to do
your project on the CPD?

22:28.548 --> 22:31.048
- Well,
everyone knows me there,

22:31.050 --> 22:32.717
and they're really nice.

22:32.719 --> 22:36.420
Sometimes they let me look
through the evidence locker.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.622
There's some crazy stuff
in there.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.391
I'm probably gonna be a cop.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.793
My mom says I don't
have to decide yet,

22:42.795 --> 22:44.829
but I'm pretty sure.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.466
- That's cool.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.935
- She likes you.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.537
- Your mom?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.573
- She calls you Kelly.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.675
Ever since my dad died,

22:57.677 --> 22:59.009
she calls almost
every guy "nitwit,"

22:59.011 --> 23:01.812
but you're just Kelly.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.081
- I like her too.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.718
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.820
- Cool.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.890
That's cool.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.960
So when's she picking me up?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.828
- I think towards
the end of shift.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.530
- You sure?

23:19.532 --> 23:22.867
I thought she said 4:00.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.668
- Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.

23:24.670 --> 23:25.770
We'll get Pouch
some real dinner.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.939
- Okay.
Hey, Pouch.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.175
Come on,
let's get you something.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.080
- Is that the Trickster Art
Gallery?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.815
- Yeah,
I'm looking into it.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.784
Just got to know what's what.

23:42.154 --> 23:46.957
- Okay.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.759
- [sighs]

23:52.798 --> 23:54.565
My first year on truck,

23:54.567 --> 23:57.435
I was so pumped
to get into a fire

23:57.437 --> 24:00.204
that I forgot to open
the air cylinder on my SCBA.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.773
- [chuckles]

24:02.775 --> 24:04.508
- That was a mistake.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.178
Today?

24:07.180 --> 24:08.946
- Are you sure
you made a mistake?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.181
- [scoffs]

24:10.183 --> 24:11.782
If I would have waited
for backup,

24:11.784 --> 24:13.050
we would have gotten
out of that fire

24:13.052 --> 24:14.718
two minutes earlier.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.220
The guys would have been
out of there sooner.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.122
That man would have inhaled
a lot less smoke.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.690
We might have even
saved the building.

24:19.692 --> 24:23.594
- But you got him out.

24:23.596 --> 24:27.097
- I shouldn't be making
mistakes anymore.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.967
- Look, I'm sure Severide
reamed you out, right?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.203
- Huh.
- Look.

24:32.205 --> 24:35.606
Honestly, that guy
operates on his gut

24:35.608 --> 24:37.541
80% of the time.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.243
He wasn't you in there.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.545
He didn't see what you saw,

24:41.547 --> 24:43.848
what you felt.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.683
Sometimes it's your call.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.855
- [sighs]

24:50.857 --> 24:53.891
- Our job is not
black and white.

24:57.762 --> 25:00.831
- Whoa, whoa, hey.
That's per night?

25:00.833 --> 25:04.101
I thought we were
talking weekly here.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.604
Well, how many people
can we squeeze inside

25:06.606 --> 25:08.506
of a standard room?

25:08.508 --> 25:09.907
Yeah, okay.
Well, you know what?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.610
Let me call you back.
All right, bye.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.878
What's going on?

25:13.880 --> 25:16.580
- You bailed on your blood work?

25:16.582 --> 25:17.581
- I didn't bail.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.183
I just, uh, haven't gone yet.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.851
- It's exactly the same thing.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.686
- No, it's not.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.656
Listen, my cousin Stas
in Omsk,

25:25.658 --> 25:28.058
he waited till he was 33
to ever see a doctor.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.828
- Okay, Otis, you have
to find out what's going on.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.129
You're not a kid.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.297
I shouldn't have
to explain this to you.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.632
This could all be nothing!

25:34.634 --> 25:36.033
- Or it could be something,
right?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.669
Let's just get Vegas
straightened out and, you know--

25:38.671 --> 25:39.904
- Who cares about Vegas?

25:39.906 --> 25:42.039
- I do. I care.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.846
she was going to get shot
when she woke up this morning?

25:48.848 --> 25:50.681
I can't control
what happens tomorrow,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.750
but I can enjoy today,

25:52.752 --> 25:53.984
so we're going to Vegas.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.086
You cannot compare yourself
to Holloway.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.221
You need to get the test.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.722
- I don't know how much
clearer I can be.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.724
I don't want to know.

26:06.832 --> 26:09.633

You forget something?

26:09.635 --> 26:12.303
- I talked to the CPD
like you requested.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.805
They mentioned that
you thought the box

26:14.807 --> 26:16.340
may have been here a few days.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.008
- The money was with my mail.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.677
It could have come in off shift.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.678
- Right.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.080
I checked the company
on the box.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.950
It doesn't exist.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.185
- Okay.
- Okay?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.187
- Al, I'm getting the feeling

26:30.189 --> 26:32.957
you're not just here
to investigate the bribe.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.158
I turned the money in.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.159
- Right.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.894
You turned in the $10,000

26:36.896 --> 26:38.996
three days after you got it.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.965
You didn't turn it into the BOE.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.233
You turned it into
your cop buddy in intelligence.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.702
- I wasn't cutting any corners.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.838
- I'd really like to sit
and talk about this,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.607
but I already
turned the paperwork in

26:49.609 --> 26:50.841
for a full investigation.

26:50.843 --> 26:55.012
I meet with the Inspector
General 3:00 tomorrow.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.981
You should be there.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.356
- Everything worked out?

27:12.297 --> 27:14.198
Are you sure
you want to call her?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.869
- Al Nelson?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.404
Al plays poker with
your predecessor Becks

27:20.406 --> 27:21.872
three times a week.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.241
There's no way he takes this
easy on you.

27:24.243 --> 27:27.411
I turned it in--same day.
I did nothing wrong.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.679
- I'm not saying you did,

27:28.681 --> 27:31.982
but I doubt this
was actually a bribe.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.385
It's more likely someone's
looking to jam you up.

27:34.387 --> 27:37.921
I tried to run a company
out of a city contract.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.923
- Okay.
We might never know for sure.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.058
- I want to find out who it was.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.793
- It doesn't matter who it was.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.695
Someone gave you
a clean box of cash

27:44.697 --> 27:46.730
so Al would pin you down
in an investigation.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.098
The bell's already been rung.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.267

is us un-ringing it.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.935

27:51.937 --> 27:53.404
- I move things around.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.776
- Okay.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.711

28:12.391 --> 28:14.124
- Okay, all right.
All right.
