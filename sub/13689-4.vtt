{\an8}Oh, I shouldn't say that.
Can you not air that?

40:50.614 --> 40:52.416
{\an8}I love her.
Oh, no. Really.

40:52.483 --> 40:53.851
{\an8}I don't want that to be aired.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.252
{\an8}- Get the [bleep] away from me,
all right?

40:55.319 --> 40:56.787
{\an8}- Stop, Marlon.
Stop. Just stop.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.622
{\an7}- First of all, no, no, no, no.
I'm not talking to you.

40:58.689 --> 41:00.457
{\an8}Why are you mad at me
when your man is the one

41:00.524 --> 41:01.826
{\an8}<i>that came into my bed?</i>

41:01.892 --> 41:03.694
{\an8}If you're mad about that,
that's something

41:03.761 --> 41:06.096
{\an8}that you're not doing
in your relationship.

41:06.163 --> 41:07.498
{\an8}Not me.

41:07.565 --> 41:09.733
{\an8}You're mad 'cause your boy
was in my bed.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.669
- Bitch, shut the [bleep] up!
- We've already squashed that.

41:11.735 --> 41:12.837
- You should've stayed at home

41:12.903 --> 41:14.471
{\an1}if you didn't want
no competition.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.574
- Shut the [bleep] up!
Shut the [bleep] up!

Let me be me.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.955

Allie, that's not happening.
