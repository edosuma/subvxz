It's going to be an insane

We all know what happens
when you get the money, Mike.

00:19.724 --> 00:21.344
Ohh!

00:21.413 --> 00:23.172
Ronnie continues to come for me.

00:23.241 --> 00:25.000
I'm gonna have to check him.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.862
Hi, it's Mike.
Ronnie likes French fries.

00:26.931 --> 00:29.862
If Mike, like, slips up
in the French fry way,

00:29.931 --> 00:32.137
Ron would just
physically destroy him.

of the vacation.

01:07.482 --> 01:09.172
I love guests
this time of year.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.620
I never have seen
Ron without Sammi,

01:13.689 --> 01:14.931
so it's definitely
gonna be weird

01:15.000 --> 01:16.275
seeing Ron with another girl,

01:16.344 --> 01:18.275
especially 'cause
Sam is my friend.

01:18.344 --> 01:22.068
Well, look at you.
He's all nervous.

01:22.137 --> 01:25.068
I'm excited to see Jen,
but I'm nervous

01:25.137 --> 01:28.034
because I don't want anyone
to bring up, like,

01:28.103 --> 01:29.896
the French fry
or the bathroom.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.034
I'll decipher what goes on
in my relationship.

01:32.103 --> 01:33.241
This isn't Sam and Ron anymore.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.413
There's gonna be no more

01:34.482 --> 01:36.586

01:36.655 --> 01:40.241
I hear movement.

01:44.689 --> 01:47.931
Go get her, go get her.You guys are so stupid.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.448
I hate all of you.

01:49.517 --> 01:50.827
Ronnie's stressed.

01:50.896 --> 01:52.379
I would be excited
if my girl was coming up.

01:52.448 --> 01:55.517
Somebody's wife is here!
Somebody's wife is here!

01:55.586 --> 01:58.965
But then again, I didn't -- up,
and dip in some French fries.

01:59.034 --> 02:01.448
This is so--Look at how nervous you are!

02:03.241 --> 02:04.379
Oh, my God.

02:04.448 --> 02:05.827

They're creepy, sorry.

02:07.862 --> 02:11.241
Hello, welcome.
Welcome!

02:13.344 --> 02:15.413
Hi, I'm Deena.
Nice to meet you.Hi, nice to meet you.

02:15.482 --> 02:17.413
A wise man once said,

02:17.482 --> 02:19.275
"Never fall in love
at the Jersey shore."

02:19.344 --> 02:21.620
But on the next page,
it also said,

02:21.689 --> 02:24.241
"Never bring your pregnant
girlfriend to Miami."

02:24.310 --> 02:25.517
All right, maybe we should
give them a minute

02:25.586 --> 02:27.000
and not be so weird.No, no, no.

02:27.068 --> 02:28.344
Let's just follow them
like this.

02:28.413 --> 02:30.344
Let's circle them.
Let's circle around them.

02:30.413 --> 02:32.344
We literally were
standing over them

02:32.413 --> 02:33.931
as they were
trying to embrace.

Let's put your stuff upstairs.

02:38.551 --> 02:41.000
Ronnie, show her my room!

02:41.068 --> 02:44.034
Ronnie's gonna, you know,
give her a tour of the house.

02:44.103 --> 02:45.275
See what I have to live with?

02:45.344 --> 02:47.793
Be careful.
Very tricky stairs.

02:47.862 --> 02:49.724
He's gonna show her
the bedroom...

02:49.793 --> 02:51.620
This is Pauly's room,
of course.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.241

03:05.344 --> 03:08.275
Is it weird seeing Ronnie
with another girl in this house?

03:08.344 --> 03:09.551
It is kind of weird.It's kinda weird, yeah.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.206
It's been
a long time, though.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.689
Do I look way bigger or no?

03:12.758 --> 03:13.931
No.
No?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.172
She's like the same height
as Ronnie.

03:15.241 --> 03:16.931
They're, like,
kind of perfect together.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.103
Do you like our house?Yeah, I love it.

03:20.172 --> 03:22.000
Jen, she's the cutest
pregnant woman ever.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.931
Like, I was pregnant two times,
and I never looked that good.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.103
What nationality are you?I'm, like...

03:27.172 --> 03:30.689
80% Great Britain
or something.

03:30.758 --> 03:32.586
Say what?

03:32.655 --> 03:33.758
Yeah.

03:33.827 --> 03:35.068
Can you speak Britain?

03:35.137 --> 03:36.620
No.

03:36.689 --> 03:38.620
'Allo!Oh, my God.

03:38.689 --> 03:41.103
I mean, I think I know
how to speak Great Britain.

03:41.172 --> 03:44.413
Britain isn't a language.
It's English.Oh.

03:44.482 --> 03:45.758

03:45.827 --> 03:48.000
No, that's Australian.

I don't think Ron's ready
for Jen to come here.

03:52.413 --> 03:56.793
This is our first
legit guest ever.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.689
Did you meet Sam?I didn't.

03:59.758 --> 04:01.655
I-- she's very quiet.

04:01.724 --> 04:05.689
We have never did, like,
family dinner with an outsider.

04:05.758 --> 04:07.586
This is gonna be intense.

for being welcoming to Jen.

Let's enjoy the dinner,
and I can't wait

04:24.000 --> 04:25.068
to have a good time
tonight, honestly.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.241
Welcome, Jen.

04:26.310 --> 04:27.724
Yes, welcome to
the  show.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.448
Yeah, the mess.Welcome, Jen.

04:32.586 --> 04:34.724
This is the most awkward
dinner we've ever had.

04:34.793 --> 04:36.724
That's all I'm gonna
say.

04:36.793 --> 04:38.379
Why?Honestly.
It's just, it's--

04:38.448 --> 04:39.862
Am I making it awkward?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.241
No! No!They're--

04:41.310 --> 04:42.724

it awk.

04:42.793 --> 04:44.344
We just never had
a guest before.

04:44.413 --> 04:45.620
Yeah, we don't know
how to behave.We don't know how to act.

04:45.689 --> 04:47.448
I know, you guys look
a little uncomfortable.

04:47.517 --> 04:48.896
We don't wanna say
anything wrong.

04:48.965 --> 04:51.275
We're kinda like a pack
of wolves, I'm not gonna lie.

04:51.344 --> 04:53.103
You bring one of
your guests over here,

04:53.172 --> 04:54.551

what's gonna happen.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.896

like, sitting there,

04:56.965 --> 04:58.827

I feel.

05:05.275 --> 05:08.034
Damn, Jenni.We're all married,
we need to know.

05:08.103 --> 05:09.793
So, Ron always says,

05:09.862 --> 05:12.620
"I'd rather pay child support
before alimony."

05:12.689 --> 05:15.241
And I just wanna know if,
like, Jen feels the same.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.310
I mean, we're gonna take it
one step at a time.

05:18.379 --> 05:20.965
So, does she know
about your commitment issues?

05:21.034 --> 05:22.620
We got a lot going on
over at the house.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.931

for desserts.

being a dad?

Yes! He's gonna be amazing.Yes, because of his sisters.

05:29.206 --> 05:31.206
He's gonna be
an amazing dad.Yeah.

05:31.275 --> 05:33.206
I remember you coming to see
Lorenzo when he was small.

05:33.275 --> 05:34.689
And he would hold him
and be like, "Mmm."He flew in

05:34.758 --> 05:36.724
to see Meilani, too.Yeah, he's gonna
be a great dad.

05:36.793 --> 05:37.724
He loves kids.

05:37.793 --> 05:39.068
One for Jen--

05:39.137 --> 05:40.586
No, I want
an actual piece.

05:40.655 --> 05:41.896
No, I'm gonna have
one separate for these two.

05:43.482 --> 05:44.758
And I'll get...
With only one fork.

05:44.827 --> 05:48.551

Is that your piece, Mike?

Hey, Sam.

30:06.551 --> 30:07.827

30:07.896 --> 30:10.172

a pretty easy phone call.

breathe, you cheated.

an explanation.

Titties in the face.

call you and tell you, you know?

31:17.758 --> 31:20.344
And that's what's
caused all this .

31:20.413 --> 31:23.034
No, Vinny, what caused it is what you do.

31:23.103 --> 31:25.103
It has nothing to do with you  being honest

31:25.172 --> 31:27.724

38:38.068 --> 38:40.034
She's just trying to get
to the root of why you
would not be with her.

38:40.103 --> 38:42.344
Yeah, but-- and also
why you talk
about her, like...

38:42.413 --> 38:43.551
I don't talk .

38:43.620 --> 38:45.034
"I'd rather pay
child support than alimony."

38:46.620 --> 38:49.034
Everything?
Tell her about the bathroom?

38:49.103 --> 38:50.275
No.No?

38:50.344 --> 38:52.103
I'm afraid of her
being embarrassed

38:52.172 --> 38:53.310
because of bull.

38:53.379 --> 38:54.655
She's already
gonna be embarrassed!

38:54.724 --> 38:56.379
She's gonna be more
embarrassed at the fact

38:56.448 --> 38:57.862
that you're doing
the same thing that
you did last Miami.

38:57.931 --> 39:00.793
No.Not telling someone
and dragging it out.

39:00.862 --> 39:02.241
Put that  to bed!

39:02.310 --> 39:04.482
This is Ron...
Miami last time.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.517
But the only difference is

39:06.586 --> 39:09.551
the girl's not living with us,
and she's pregnant.

39:09.620 --> 39:12.103
So, like,
eight, nine years later,

39:12.172 --> 39:13.896
he wants his cake
and eat it, too.

39:16.068 --> 39:19.068
Nobody knows that, Ron.
I'm trying to save you.

39:19.137 --> 39:20.689
I'm trying
to be a good friend
right now to you.

39:20.758 --> 39:22.344
I understand.
You don't get it.

39:22.413 --> 39:24.206
I've done with the ,
like, I, like,

39:24.275 --> 39:26.896
I am so  done with it.
Like, I'm done.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.965
So then be
a good guy here.
But the--

39:29.034 --> 39:31.379
I made one  mistake,
so my whole life here

39:31.448 --> 39:33.000
has to revolve
around one mistake?

39:33.068 --> 39:35.689
I did it.
You know, I  up.

39:35.758 --> 39:37.034
It's my mistake.

39:37.103 --> 39:40.034
But it's like, let me
deal with it on my own.

39:40.103 --> 39:41.724
isn't
what this is about.Okay.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.068
It's about
family.

39:43.137 --> 39:44.724
Be the person
that loves Jen,

39:44.793 --> 39:46.586
can't wait
for your baby girl.

39:46.655 --> 39:48.586
these , say,

39:48.655 --> 39:50.931
" you, I got
a great woman at home."

39:51.000 --> 39:52.310
I tell them,
I'm like--

39:52.379 --> 39:54.000
No, you  don't,
'cause I'm there!

39:54.068 --> 39:56.068
Sometimes you eat French fries!
It's fast food!

39:56.137 --> 39:57.310
You cheat on a diet.

39:57.379 --> 39:58.689
Basically, Jenni is saying

39:58.758 --> 40:00.379
what everybody's
thinking to Ron.

40:00.448 --> 40:03.275
In other words, "Smarten up,
do the right thing here.

40:03.344 --> 40:06.413
You gotta be full transparencies
with your baby mama."

40:06.482 --> 40:09.068
I have a daughter.
She's three years old.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.862
I will make sure
every  guy in her life

40:11.931 --> 40:15.586
puts her so  above
that no man is worth her time.

40:15.655 --> 40:17.620
And that's gonna be you
in three months,

40:17.689 --> 40:19.275
when your
daughter is here.

40:19.344 --> 40:22.344
And you will not want
what you are in her life.

40:22.413 --> 40:24.827
What I used to be.
I'm not that person.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.551
So become the man

40:26.620 --> 40:29.275
that your daughter
aspires to have.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.103
Jen has no idea
what you really did.

40:32.172 --> 40:33.793
And just 'cause
you're trying

40:33.862 --> 40:35.034
to hit "delete"
with the roommates

40:35.103 --> 40:36.827
and act like we don't know
what you did,

40:36.896 --> 40:39.206
it happened.
Tell her!

40:39.275 --> 40:40.275
I'm, like, I am not--

40:40.344 --> 40:42.241
So then act like it here!

40:42.310 --> 40:44.793
I am!
That's it!
Just act like it here.

40:44.862 --> 40:47.137
For that baby to be,
like, a month or two old

40:47.206 --> 40:49.000
when she might find out...

40:49.068 --> 40:50.275
are you out of
your  mind?

40:50.344 --> 40:51.689
Then that
ain't pregnant.

40:51.758 --> 40:53.448
Then she gonna cut you.
She gonna burn your house down.

40:53.517 --> 40:54.965
She gonna blow up your car.

40:55.034 --> 40:57.068
And you're gonna be
buried somewhere on my property,

40:57.137 --> 40:58.551
and no one's gonna find you.

40:58.620 --> 40:59.724
So you want me
to  tell her,

40:59.793 --> 41:00.965
so we can cause
a  fight and get--

41:01.034 --> 41:02.931
No! I just want you
to be a good man!

41:03.000 --> 41:04.275
Is that what you want?
Like--
Stop saying "alimony."

41:04.344 --> 41:06.310
Stop saying "child support."
Say, "I love this .

41:06.379 --> 41:08.896
She's my girl."Like, yes,
I love her, but--

41:08.965 --> 41:10.137
You don't show that here!

41:10.206 --> 41:12.241
♪♪
