WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:09.300
Rebel intelligence was right.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.678
The Empire was building something
over Geonosis.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.804
Yeah, but what?

00:12.888 --> 00:15.306
I've never seen an orbital
construction field this big.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.600
The Geonosians made weapons
back in the Clone War.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.603
Whatever they were up to,
I'm betting we're not gonna like it.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.689
Must've been huge if they had
to build it up here

00:22.773 --> 00:24.273
instead of down on the surface.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.067
Chopper, run a planetary scan.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.195
Good idea.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.947
I know through experience
the bugs down there

00:31.031 --> 00:33.449
don't take to unexpected guests.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.704
No life?

00:37.788 --> 00:39.122
You cross-wired?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.041
There are billions of bugs on Geonosis.
Scan again.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.045
They're dead. All of 'em.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.547
I don't like any of this.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.090
We don't know that for sure.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.509
Let's check out
that construction module.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.738
Keep it running in case things...

01:11.822 --> 01:13.656
ln case things go like they usually do?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.575
Pretty much, yeah.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.496
What exactly are we looking for?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.081
The primary databanks.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.000
They might have records
of what the Empire was making.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.085
My gut tells me
those databanks will be empty.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.175
My gut tells me this is a trap.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.516
How perceptive.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.279
Lasats. Never know when to give up.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.281
Spectre-2, we're in the usual mess.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.783
Agent Kallus has joined us,

01:56.867 --> 01:58.868
and there's some droid
out there locking down doors.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.411
Agent Kallus, how lovely.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.038
Chopper, go get that droid.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.564
Come on, Chop. Get him!

02:35.280 --> 02:36.823
Took you long enough.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.327
Zeb!

02:41.411 --> 02:42.829
We'll meet you at the ship!

02:43.372 --> 02:44.705
You heard him. Let's go.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.301
Spectre-4, we're leaving.
Where are you?

02:57.970 --> 02:59.262
Busy right now!

03:05.853 --> 03:06.978
Zeb, where are you?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.855
Spectre-6, no need to wait.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.482
Got my own ride outta here.
Escape pod.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.364
What a day we're having.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.130
Zeb made it out. Zeb, you copy? Zeb?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.382
He must've lost his comlink.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.718
He's heading for Geonosis.
We'll be able to find him.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.969
TIEs incoming.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.465
Hey, Chop, you track Zeb's trajectory?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.303
Yes, we want him back.
Don't be a sleemo. Find him.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.165
What... What are you doing?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.630
I'm just thinkin' about how
easy I could crush your head.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.010
But...

05:44.094 --> 05:45.845
I'd rather wait for you to heal

05:45.929 --> 05:49.306
so we can finish our fight
fair and square.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.396
You're expecting your rebel
friends to come to your rescue?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.858
Your friends fled.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.485
lf anyone finds us, it'll be the Empire,

06:01.611 --> 06:03.612
and you will be captured.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.824
Well, that's not gonna happen.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.709
That's not happening either.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.637
It'll be night soon.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.641
Don't tell me you're afraid of the dark.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.145
It's not just going to get dark.

06:36.229 --> 06:40.733
It's going to get colder,
too cold for this to keep us warm.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.569
And here I thought Geonosis
was a desert planet.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.822
That is Geonosis.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.909
We are on one of its moons.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.747
How is it that
you have bested me even once?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.708
Get a sense of humor, Agent.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.973
The transponder,
probably damaged in the crash.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.726
lf you can repair it,
reactivate its signal,

07:15.811 --> 07:19.522
maybe the Empire
will find us before we freeze.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.442
Or worse.

07:24.820 --> 07:29.740
I'll take my chances with the cold and
whatever we're sharing this hole with.

07:29.825 --> 07:33.327
I know what happens to Lasat
in an Imperial prison.

07:33.411 --> 07:37.081
You don't know much.
Cooperate, and you will get a trial.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.501
Right.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.136
You better decide soon.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.022
We should make another sweep.
Maybe we missed him somehow.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.941
Bio-signs on the planet
are still negative,

08:04.025 --> 08:06.360
and there was no sign
of the pod anywhere on the surface.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.653
What about its transponder?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.406
I checked all the frequencies. Nothing.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.659
It's only a matter of time
before Imperial reinforcements arrive.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.119
lf we're not gone by then...

08:15.203 --> 08:18.497
Well, then we need to work faster.
Widen all scans.

08:23.545 --> 08:27.214
There. Fixed it.
And I adjusted the frequency.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.425
Now anyone can pick up its signal.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.552
So?

08:31.636 --> 08:35.890
Maybe you won't die today,
but the Empire will win.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.350
Every day, we recruit more informers.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.811
Every day, we persuade
rebel sympathizers

08:40.937 --> 08:42.897
to reconsider their allegiances.

08:46.610 --> 08:51.614
And every day, more beings get fed
up with the Empire and join us.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.620
Its power cell is...

08:58.413 --> 08:59.622
Frozen.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.040
And we'll be next.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.046
What... Where are you going?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.257
What are you doing over there?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.555
It's warm.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.933
What did you find? What is that?

09:19.017 --> 09:22.353
I don't know, but it's warm.
And it throws light.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.691
Probably some kind of meteorite.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.487
Here. Warm yourself up.

09:37.786 --> 09:42.665
You really think we'll survive,
with whatever that is in there?

09:42.749 --> 09:47.962
Plus the temperature's dropping,
and our only heat source is this thing.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.464
And who knows how long it'll last?

09:50.548 --> 09:52.549
You're so quick to give up hope.

09:52.634 --> 09:56.762
Like I said, the transponder's working.
My friends will find us.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.848
The transponder's signal will
never get through the ice.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.102
Yeah, you're probably right.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.854
But Lasat never know
when to give up, remember?

10:05.939 --> 10:08.023
We'll just climb this up to the surface.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.900
Simple.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.384
You're going to hurt yourself.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.886
Will you just shut up?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.487
How'd you like a few more
broken bones?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.751
Like this day couldn't get any better.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.233
Karabast! What was that?

12:14.943 --> 12:18.237
Don't know,
but it's probably going to come back.

12:18.321 --> 12:22.241
Yeah, and it's probably
gonna bring its friends.

12:23.618 --> 12:28.705
That is the order of things.
The strong survive, the weak perish.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.252
ls that what happened on Geonosis?
The weak needed to perish?

12:33.336 --> 12:37.965
The only thing I know about Geonosis
is that the population is gone.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.050
I never asked questions.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.052
Well, maybe you should start.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.179
Or are you afraid
of the answers you'll get?

12:44.681 --> 12:48.350
Afraid you'll learn the Geonosians were
wiped out by your precious Empire?

12:48.435 --> 12:52.604
And why would we do that?
What could possibly be the point?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.940
Good questions.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.693
Chase the answers,
and maybe you'll learn the truth.

12:58.403 --> 13:03.073
You know, you'll never get
out of here without my help.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.703
You're in no shape to help anybody.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.789
I can tell you exactly
how to climb out of here.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.544
All right. We'll work together.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.884
I see you modified it
for close quarters fighting.

13:21.968 --> 13:22.968
Impressive.

13:23.428 --> 13:27.931
But you shouldn't have it.
It's not a trophy. Now hold still.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.278
I didn't take it as a trophy.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.614
The Lasat guardsman I faced...

13:44.574 --> 13:48.494
He fought well, died with honor.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.246
He gave me the rifle before...

13:51.331 --> 13:52.915
The Boosahn Keeraw.

13:52.999 --> 13:53.999
The what?

13:54.083 --> 13:57.002
The Boosahn Keeraw,
Lasat warrior way.

13:57.837 --> 14:02.257
When one is defeated by a superior foe,
he gifts his weapon.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.426
I was...

14:05.595 --> 14:07.387
I was only doing my duty.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.516
It was nothing personal.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.685
Yeah, well,
what the Empire did on Lasan,

14:13.770 --> 14:15.521
I'll never forget it.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.690
We all have things we won't forget.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.610
I remember my first unit.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.695
The boys and I
were deployed to Onderon

14:23.780 --> 14:27.199
to bring peace and security
to a troubled world.

14:27.283 --> 14:31.328
We were on a routine patrol
and ran into one of your rebel friends,

14:31.412 --> 14:34.623
a Lasat mercenary
who worked for Saw Gerrera.

14:34.999 --> 14:39.002
I was lucky,
knocked out by the first blast.

14:39.963 --> 14:44.132
I came to, but found I couldn't move.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.636
And then I saw him,

14:47.720 --> 14:52.266
the Lasat, calmly walk
through smoke and fire

14:52.350 --> 14:55.352
to finish my unit off, one by one.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.814
The injured never had a chance.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.943
Always wondered why he let me live.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.655
Well, you can't judge
all Lasats as the same.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.366
Does that sentiment apply to Imperials?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.827
All the Imperials I know.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.124
I'll take that for you, for the climb.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.509
We'll get it when we reach the top.
Time to go.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.597
Hold it.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.976
Don't climb the walls. Go up the pillars.

15:36.060 --> 15:40.439
What? Pillars will never hold my weight,
never mind yours added on.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.066
They hold up this cave, don't they?

15:45.737 --> 15:49.323
lf you're wrong,
I'm feeding you to that thing.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.824
Fair enough.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.930
This is a terrible idea.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.390
Just climb.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.102
There are two of them!

16:19.187 --> 16:21.438
-Karabast!
-"Karabast. Karabast!"

16:21.522 --> 16:22.981
What does that even mean?

16:23.066 --> 16:26.193
Right now, it means
you're a lot heavier than you look.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.365
The goal is not to fall.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.010
Hold still and hope this works.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.262
Hope? Hope what works?

17:12.907 --> 17:15.117
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.566
Karabast.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.752
Better activate the transponder.
It's a lot colder up here.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.044
We won't last long.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.381
Yeah, but I think
I'd rather freeze than be eaten.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.110
Let's hope it works.

18:32.195 --> 18:35.113
Of course, since you "adjusted" it,

18:35.198 --> 18:37.574
we don't know who will
pick up its signal.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.034
Guess all we can do is wait.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.996
Least we've got this to keep us warm.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.041
Still think your friends will find you?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.502
Unless the Empire gets here first.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.215
On Lasan...

18:54.050 --> 18:57.385
It... It wasn't supposed
to be a massacre.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.473
But I realized the Empire wanted
to make an example.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.143
I know before, I took credit for it.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.606
What happened on Lasan,
it's over for me.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.858
I've moved on.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.612
By the way, it's Zeb.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.697
My name, it's Zeb.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.076
Short for Garazeb. I know.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.680
That's a ship.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.974
Yeah. But whose?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.521
Come on.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.737
Your friends did find you.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.573
Like I said they would.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.118
You know, we will treat you fairly.

20:03.953 --> 20:08.290
I'll take my chances
with the Empire, Zeb.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.093
-Zeb!
-Zeb!

20:20.177 --> 20:21.720
Told you he'd be fine.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.722
Zeb, you made it!

20:23.806 --> 20:26.099
We picked up your beacon.
We were so worried.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.101
It wasn't so bad.

20:28.185 --> 20:32.230
We've all been in tighter spots.
I knew you'd find me eventually.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.861
Yeah, all right. Come on, Zeb.
It's... It's cold out here.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.779
You've been in it for two seconds.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.781
Yeah, two seconds too long.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.344
Admiral Konstantine.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.929
Agent Kallus.
