00:38.071 --> 00:41.140
( whining )

01:02.762 --> 01:05.197
Woof, woof !

01:16.476 --> 01:18.544
Woof, woof, woof !

02:13.366 --> 02:15.434
Nice try, fleabag.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.454
<i>Zeus</i> !

02:35.522 --> 02:36.688
Get outta here !

02:36.756 --> 02:38.056
<i>Blcch,</i>

02:40.293 --> 02:42.027
Dog germs !

02:45.165 --> 02:47.132
Do I smell
some dinner ?!

02:47.200 --> 02:49.668
<i>Breakfast.</i>

02:49.736 --> 02:51.503
I knew that.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.972
You've been up
all night again, huh ?

02:54.040 --> 02:56.108
Sorry,
it's just that

02:56.176 --> 02:58.744
I've been working
on this Melody

02:58.811 --> 03:02.814
And it's somewhere in there.
I just can't find it.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.452
What's this ?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.954
Breakfast burrito.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.556
Cool, thanks.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.192
Let me see
your face.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.994
Excellent, b+.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.632
So, what's in
this burrito ?

03:20.700 --> 03:23.335
Eggs, refried beans,
onions, jalapeños,

03:23.403 --> 03:26.538
Peanut butter,
mozzarella cheese,
pineapple chunks.

03:26.606 --> 03:27.806
Oh, yeah,
and lettuce.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.875
So it's nutritionally
balanced.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.477
Oh, shoot !
My burrito !

03:35.515 --> 03:37.015
Ugh !

03:39.719 --> 03:41.987
( whispering )
Zeus, psst.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.057
C'mon, c'mon.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.492
Good boy,
eat it up.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.328
Thank you,
<i>thank you.</i>

03:58.638 --> 04:00.539
Oh, <i>good,</i>
<i>you finished yours.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:02.541
I'll go get you
another one.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.255
Woof !

04:18.524 --> 04:20.392
And you two <i>stay</i>

04:20.459 --> 04:24.429
At the enrichment program
all day, okay ?

04:24.497 --> 04:27.099
( in robot voice )
you-are-understood-mother.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.934
Ditto.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.103
I'm not in the mood for
the principal calling me

04:31.170 --> 04:32.904
Telling me
that you two--

04:32.972 --> 04:34.406
( cat shrieking )

04:34.474 --> 04:36.141
What is that ?

04:42.048 --> 04:43.081
Lovely.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.913
Jordan, cow bone !

05:16.449 --> 05:17.983
Woof, woof, woof !

05:21.688 --> 05:22.788
Hey !

05:24.557 --> 05:25.724
Ahh !

05:26.693 --> 05:28.760
Cow bone.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.136
Cow bone,
cow bone !

05:38.204 --> 05:40.605
Zeus, cow bone !

05:40.673 --> 05:42.007
Zeus !

05:42.075 --> 05:44.443
Zeus, cow bone !

05:44.510 --> 05:47.145
Zeus, cow bone !
Cow bone !

05:47.213 --> 05:48.980
C'mon, go on !

05:49.048 --> 05:50.315
Go on !

05:54.787 --> 05:57.456
Pfft...

05:57.523 --> 05:59.825
I'm so sorry.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.394
Let me help.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.863
No, that's okay.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.765
Oh, jeez.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.201
Here, let me help.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.269
Just how do you
propose to do that ?

06:11.337 --> 06:14.306
I'll put your flowers
back in the ground here.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.509
Wait, wait, no.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.579
Actually, I have a very
particular way of doing this.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.582
I like to put the roots
in the ground.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.351
<i>Oh...</i>

06:26.419 --> 06:28.320
Very...

06:28.388 --> 06:30.021
You new in
the neighborhood ?

06:30.089 --> 06:31.256
Yeah.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.127
Just renting
for the week ?

06:35.194 --> 06:37.896
Actually we'll be here
'till the end of July.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.267
Great !

06:42.335 --> 06:44.503
I'm Terry Barnett.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.173
Mary Beth...
Dunhill.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.876
Mary Beth.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.044
Right.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.415
I'd love to stay and chat
in my present state

06:56.482 --> 06:58.683
But I'm late
for work.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.951
That's okay,

07:00.019 --> 07:01.453
I'll just replant
your flowers.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.455
Oh, no, that's alright.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.624
Is there anything
I can do ?

07:05.691 --> 07:07.125
Uh, no.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.060
How 'bout
your laundry ?

07:09.128 --> 07:10.695
I'm a great
ironer.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.199
If you can just
restrain that...

07:14.267 --> 07:15.934
Zeus.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.302
Yes !

07:17.370 --> 07:18.870
Thank you.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.214
Me, Terry, <i>you</i> ?

07:30.883 --> 07:31.817
Judith.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.218
You ?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.553
Nora.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.622
( groaning )

09:04.911 --> 09:06.778
You're late.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.680
I've been frantic,
don't ask.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.649
What if Roxanne’s
not there ?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.284
We've never been
late before.

09:12.351 --> 09:13.752
What if she gets
eaten by a shark

09:13.819 --> 09:15.086
Sitting there
waiting for us ?

09:15.154 --> 09:19.090
What if I'm sorry, Becky,
I had a rough morning ?

09:19.158 --> 09:21.259
Oh, yeah ?

09:21.327 --> 09:23.762
Well, it's about
to get rougher.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.231
We've been rejected
by the Pason Foundation,

09:26.299 --> 09:28.733
<i>And</i> the manheim,

09:28.801 --> 09:30.569
And the delphi.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.605
Great !

09:33.673 --> 09:37.342
That leaves
the Rockland Grant.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.712
If I don't get <i>that,</i>
<i>I'll be--</i>

09:40.780 --> 09:43.381
Stocking goldfish
at the local store.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.050
Very funny,
Claude.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.319
I wasn't joking.

09:47.386 --> 09:51.056
Perhaps we should strive
for that grant <i>together.</i>

09:51.123 --> 09:53.224
"the sum of the parts
being greater than the whole."

09:53.292 --> 09:55.260
I don't think so.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.463
Somehow I think our
research philosophies
are <i>slightly</i> different.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.200
Oh, I didn't know
I ever <i>had</i> one.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.669
Let me know
if you change your mind.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.079
<i>He</i> should be
working with <i>sharks.</i>

10:14.146 --> 10:15.814
He'd feel
more at home.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.316
If I don't get
<i>major</i> funding soon

10:18.384 --> 10:20.018
Roxanne's gonna
be in a <i>pool</i>

10:20.086 --> 10:22.821
Doing sound recognition tests
for the <i>rest</i> of her life,

10:22.888 --> 10:24.889
Probably for <i>him.</i>

10:31.364 --> 10:32.631
Good morning, guys.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.299
Hey, Phil.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.107
Let's play the sounds of
the other dolphins for Roxanne

10:42.174 --> 10:44.109
And see if
she runs away.

10:44.176 --> 10:48.279
Okay, Roxanne,
I'm comin', sweetheart.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.849
( dolphin chirps )

11:07.233 --> 11:10.502
We'll do a body check,
check for rake marks.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.104
We'll see if she's been
playing with other dolphins.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.373
These are from our
last session, right ?

11:15.441 --> 11:16.474
Right.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.684
( sniffing )

11:25.751 --> 11:27.185
Burritos ?

11:27.253 --> 11:29.554
Do you smell
burritos ?

11:29.622 --> 11:31.523
Yeah.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.091
( loud burp )

11:36.962 --> 11:38.596
<i>You.</i>

11:38.664 --> 11:39.964
You're so cute !

11:40.032 --> 11:42.133
No, this dog
is not cute.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.669
This dog is
the hound from hell.

11:44.737 --> 11:48.540
C'mon, you Zeus,
whatever your name is.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.208
Get up here,
sit down, sit !

11:50.276 --> 11:53.378
Sit, <i>stay.</i>

11:53.446 --> 11:55.580
<i>Stay.</i>

13:06.352 --> 13:07.986
( Jordan )
Zeus !

13:08.053 --> 13:10.221
Yo, Zeus !

13:10.289 --> 13:12.757
Zeus !

13:12.825 --> 13:14.526
Zeus !

13:21.300 --> 13:22.834
I think
I got Roxanne.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.269
Great !

14:01.307 --> 14:03.174
I'm cursed.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.109
He's <i>so</i> cute.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.578
He's <i>not</i> cute.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.112
You stay
right <i>there</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:10.014
Or you're gonna get
a free swimming lesson !

14:10.082 --> 14:12.951
He's giving me
a face like that.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.129
Zeus !

14:38.544 --> 14:41.279
We've got her.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.685
Roxanne,
sorry I'm late.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.091
C'mon,
that's a girl.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.027
Good morning
to you too, Roxanne.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.228
How are you ?

15:08.941 --> 15:10.241
C'mon.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.243
Very good.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.893
Woof, woof !

15:32.064 --> 15:34.666
Thanks a lot, Zeus !

17:09.595 --> 17:11.396
( Zeus barking )

17:35.421 --> 17:38.056
Maybe if we give him
some food he'll calm down.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.925
Maybe if he <i>becomes</i> food
he'll calm down.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.160
She did not
mean that.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.795
Yes, I did.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.534
( Mary Beth )
we're outta here.

18:10.000 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

19:17.222 --> 19:19.790
Zeus,
where are you ?

19:19.858 --> 19:21.192
C'mon, Zeus !

19:21.260 --> 19:22.860
Zeus !

19:22.928 --> 19:24.295
Zeus ?

19:26.698 --> 19:29.400
Zeus ?

19:29.468 --> 19:31.235
Lost the dog.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.272
Great.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.275
My new neighbor's
gonna think

19:37.342 --> 19:40.144
I've shanghaied his dog
and fed him to the sharks.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.746
Zeus ?!

19:42.748 --> 19:44.182
( Mary Beth )
Zeus ?!

19:46.451 --> 19:48.085
<i>C'mon.</i>

19:48.153 --> 19:50.621
Oh, my gosh.
C'mere !

20:07.272 --> 20:09.173
Get the camera.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.783
I got it.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.432
7:10,

20:34.499 --> 20:36.067
2:15,

20:36.134 --> 20:37.969
Off location six.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.671
We have a canine Zeus,
we have Roxanne.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.374
Woof, woof, woof !

20:46.678 --> 20:48.346
What are
they <i>doing</i> ?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.448
Talking to
each other.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.483
They're
communicating.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.218
They are <i>talkin'.</i>

21:12.404 --> 21:13.904
I think...

21:15.407 --> 21:17.541
We're witnessing

21:17.609 --> 21:20.411
Inter-species
communication.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.887
Mary Beth.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.355
What ?

21:31.423 --> 21:34.425
You're gonna get
that Rockland Grant.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.829
Yes !

21:41.400 --> 21:42.833
I love this dog.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.001
I've always
loved this dog

21:44.069 --> 21:46.404
From the <i>minute </i>
<i>I saw that dog.</i>

21:54.579 --> 21:56.547
Linda, what have
you got ?

21:56.615 --> 21:58.716
Mother and calf.

21:58.784 --> 22:02.753
Mother and calf.
Yes.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.090
Let's separate these two
for the next 24 hours.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.459
Begin the sonar
recognition test series

22:08.527 --> 22:11.962
And increase the volume
of the masking sounds

22:12.030 --> 22:15.866
Until mother and calf
can no longer communicate.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.807
The baby
needs to <i>feed.</i>

22:22.874 --> 22:24.475
"the baby
needs to feed."

22:24.543 --> 22:27.645
The sacrifice is for
the <i>good</i> for all mankind.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.347
For <i>science.</i>

22:32.284 --> 22:36.053
Yeah, for
Dr. Claude carver.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.156
Swing it around.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.326
You got it ?

22:42.394 --> 22:45.096
Hold it steady.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.253
( Mary Beth )
great submersible.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.455
Look at that.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.924
I could really use
something like <i>that.</i>

23:13.992 --> 23:15.926
How'd <i>you</i> get it ?

23:15.994 --> 23:19.029
Oh, I pulled
a few strings.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.799
Perhaps you'd like to
take her down sometime.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.367
Oh, yeah, sure !

23:25.070 --> 23:26.637
Solo.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.674
I keep telling you

23:30.742 --> 23:33.010
Two keen scientific minds
are better than one.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.479
Yes, but neither
are any good

23:35.547 --> 23:38.315
Without the
essential ingredient.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.217
What might
that be ?

23:40.285 --> 23:42.086
Heart.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.121
Sure.

23:46.558 --> 23:47.758
Hey, hey !

23:47.826 --> 23:50.995
I'll <i>drop kick</i> you
from here to Miami !

23:51.062 --> 23:52.430
( Mary Beth )
no, you will <i>not.</i>

23:52.497 --> 23:54.999
C'mon, Zeus,
let's get outta here.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.904
Phil, get my bag,
will you ?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.456
There you go.

24:18.523 --> 24:20.658
You deserve it.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.162
( boy )
let's go !

24:50.021 --> 24:51.222
Great.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.597
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.466
You don't want us to have
any fun over the Summer.

25:02.534 --> 25:05.102
I don't want you
hanging out with
borderlines.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.805
Craig isn't
borderline, mom.

25:07.873 --> 25:11.976
<i>And</i> ditching your
enrichment classes.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.544
Well, we're just--

25:13.612 --> 25:15.679
We were just--

25:15.747 --> 25:16.981
Rescheduling.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.883
Yes, right.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.352
Grounded.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.853
This block,
one week.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.822
Oh, no, mom.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.657
Zeus !

25:28.860 --> 25:31.295
Zeus.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.297
Where'd you guys
find him ?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.866
Actually he found <i>me,</i>
<i>and you are ?</i>

25:35.934 --> 25:38.135
I'm Jordan Barnett.
I'm with him.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.073
I see you and Zeus
have become friends.

25:43.141 --> 25:46.443
Well, miracles
sometimes happen.

25:46.511 --> 25:48.345
What's that ?

25:48.413 --> 25:51.148
Some photos
I took this morning.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.717
What ?

25:53.785 --> 25:55.786
I can't
believe--

25:55.854 --> 25:57.721
Oh, my God !

25:57.789 --> 25:59.356
( Mary Beth )
charming.

25:59.424 --> 26:02.359
Looking good, mom !

26:02.427 --> 26:04.562
Working on
two weeks.

26:04.629 --> 26:05.963
Here.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.465
Your house has
a satellite dish,
doesn't it ?

26:08.533 --> 26:09.633
Yeah.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.168
Mom ?

26:11.236 --> 26:14.038
Okay, but not
all the channels.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.639
C'mon, Zeus !

26:18.643 --> 26:21.478
Your dog was on the boat
with me all day.

26:21.546 --> 26:22.680
Really ?

26:22.747 --> 26:24.615
I'm sorry, I won't
let that happen again.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.717
No, actually it sort of
seemed to suit him.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.053
Really.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.421
Really.

26:30.488 --> 26:32.990
I'd like to
take him out <i>again</i> if --

26:33.058 --> 26:35.426
Sure, you can take him
on a cruise to Antarctica,

26:35.493 --> 26:38.963
But he's Jordan's dog.

26:40.632 --> 26:42.600
Would you mind

26:42.667 --> 26:44.668
If I just ask
him something ?

26:44.736 --> 26:47.004
Go right ahead.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.640
Gimme that !

26:49.708 --> 26:51.709
Can I just watch this
for a <i>minute</i> ?

26:53.178 --> 26:55.079
Girls, girls,
time out.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.247
Where's Jordan ?

26:57.315 --> 26:59.116
In there.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.485
What are you
watching ?

27:03.121 --> 27:05.856
( Mary Beth )
hello.

27:05.924 --> 27:06.957
Oh, hi.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.125
Hi, can I come in ?

27:08.193 --> 27:10.094
Yeah, sure.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.329
"braveheart".

27:12.397 --> 27:14.331
Wow !

27:14.399 --> 27:16.233
Did you do
all these ?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.135
Yeah.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.838
That one's gonna be the cover
for my dad's opera score.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.907
Your dad
writes opera ?

27:23.975 --> 27:26.210
It's a rock opera.

27:26.277 --> 27:27.811
Most of the time
he does music

27:27.879 --> 27:30.247
For commercials
and really tall elevators.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.049
It's only
to pay the bills.

27:32.117 --> 27:37.488
( woman on TV )
we have now brought the
psychic friends network...

27:37.555 --> 27:41.425
Love that
satellite dish, huh ?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.794
This is gonna
sound really lame,

27:43.862 --> 27:46.163
But we don't even
have <i>one</i> TV in our house.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.400
We're like a media
<i>impaired</i> family.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.135
Oh.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.144
Hey, is this
your mom ?

28:00.211 --> 28:02.079
Yeah... She died.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.483
Sorry to hear that.
You must miss her a lot.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.926
Can I talk to you
for a minute ?

28:15.994 --> 28:17.961
Yeah.

28:22.467 --> 28:25.169
I think Zeus is
a very special dog.

28:25.236 --> 28:28.539
What do
you mean ?

28:28.606 --> 28:31.075
Well...

28:31.142 --> 28:36.380
I <i>think</i> that Zeus
is capable of--

28:36.448 --> 28:39.683
Inter-species
communication.

28:39.751 --> 28:42.820
What's the big deal ?
I talk to Zeus all the time.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.255
Ah,

28:45.323 --> 28:47.691
But <i>Zeus</i> is talking
with my <i>dolphin.</i>

28:47.759 --> 28:50.461
You own
a <i>dolphin</i> ?

28:50.528 --> 28:52.996
I don't <i>own</i> her,
Roxanne lives in the bay,

28:53.064 --> 28:54.732
But I kinda
take care of her.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.467
She used to
live in a tank.

28:56.534 --> 28:59.369
We're reintroducing her
into the ocean.

28:59.437 --> 29:02.406
Now the problem is,

29:02.474 --> 29:05.476
That she doesn't really
take to other dolphins.

29:05.543 --> 29:08.912
But she seems
to like your Zeus.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.281
So I was thinking,

29:11.349 --> 29:13.350
It might be
really interesting

29:13.418 --> 29:15.652
To get the two together,
Zeus and Roxanne,

29:15.720 --> 29:17.855
And just see how things
go from <i>there.</i>

29:17.922 --> 29:20.491
What do
you think ?

29:20.558 --> 29:24.528
Well, this has to be
Zeus' decision.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.864
Alright.

29:28.066 --> 29:31.769
So, Zeus, would you like
to go out with Roxanne ?

29:31.836 --> 29:33.670
Woof, woof !

29:33.738 --> 29:35.672
Is that
a "yes" ?

29:35.740 --> 29:37.207
Woof !

29:37.275 --> 29:38.876
Yeah.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.177
Great.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.016
You like
our mom ?

29:46.084 --> 29:47.785
Yeah, sure I do.

29:47.852 --> 29:51.054
Enough to
go out with her ?

29:51.122 --> 29:53.924
How 'bout
Saturday ?

30:19.651 --> 30:22.119
Alright.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.754
It's okay.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.857
Okay,
new behavior.

30:29.727 --> 30:32.296
That's it.

31:03.394 --> 31:07.331
What is she <i>doing</i> out there
with that dog ?

31:07.398 --> 31:09.900
Havin' fun.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.135
No.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.038
I'll tell you
what she's doing.

31:15.106 --> 31:18.175
She's trying to
steal my grant.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.345
That's just not
gonna happen.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.614
No, sir !

31:46.738 --> 31:49.273
Hey, watch where
you're going !

31:49.340 --> 31:51.675
I <i>was</i> and I <i>am.</i>

31:51.743 --> 31:53.443
You're driving too fast.
There are kids around.

31:53.511 --> 31:54.645
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:54.712 --> 31:57.214
I was in a hurry
to visit with Miss Dunhill.

31:57.282 --> 31:58.615
Apparently
so were you,

31:58.683 --> 32:00.684
And failed to look both ways
before crossing the street.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.686
Thank God
for anti-lock brakes.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.855
What are you
doing here ?

32:04.923 --> 32:07.124
These are the manuals
for the submersible.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.759
It's yours whenever
you want it.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.761
Really ?

32:10.828 --> 32:13.063
( man )
invite me in,
I'll go over them with you.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.065
Alright.

32:15.133 --> 32:18.835
Terry, did you
need something ?

32:18.903 --> 32:21.004
Oh, no,
it's not important.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.106
Alright.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.142
Never is.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.721
So, this is
a surprise.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.056
It is ?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.791
Bye, mom.

32:40.858 --> 32:42.292
We're goin'
for a test ride.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.794
I thought you two
were grounded.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.295
Just around
the block.

32:45.363 --> 32:47.597
With Zeus
and Jordan.

32:47.665 --> 32:48.598
Please, mom ?

32:48.666 --> 32:49.933
Come on mom !

32:50.001 --> 32:51.101
One block.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.270
I love you !

32:56.541 --> 32:58.642
Thank you,
mommy.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.111
Bye, mom !

33:01.179 --> 33:04.448
You should think about
boarding school for those two.

33:04.515 --> 33:07.117
Now, where were we ?

33:07.185 --> 33:09.720
The catch.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.089
No catch.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.161
Boy.
This is it ?

33:18.229 --> 33:19.730
This is it.

33:31.309 --> 33:34.011
I don't know
about this.

33:34.078 --> 33:35.979
Woof, woof !

33:41.886 --> 33:44.588
Hey, get out
of there !

34:10.081 --> 34:12.149
( sirens )

34:26.931 --> 34:29.800
This is <i>definitely </i>
<i>getting out of hand.</i>

34:50.455 --> 34:52.656
Okay, hold it
right there.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.627
Judith ?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.539
What's going on ?

35:09.607 --> 35:11.541
Judith and Nora
are getting busted.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.944
This is probably
their first offense.

35:14.011 --> 35:16.947
I can probably get them off
with a stern warning.

35:17.014 --> 35:18.715
Mm-hmm.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.550
C'mon.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.189
So, am I
to believe

35:26.257 --> 35:28.058
That cute little dog
and your dolphin

35:28.126 --> 35:29.860
Are actually talking ?

35:29.927 --> 35:31.294
Incessantly.

35:31.362 --> 35:32.496
Wow.

35:32.563 --> 35:35.365
I have all this communication
skills data on file.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.234
Perhaps you might
wanna reconsider

35:37.301 --> 35:38.802
About pooling
our research

35:38.870 --> 35:41.471
And applying for that
Rockland Mammal Grant together ?

35:41.539 --> 35:42.939
The catch !

35:43.007 --> 35:45.108
What, what catch ?

35:45.176 --> 35:46.543
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.445
I already applied
for my grant.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.580
But thanks
for the mini sub.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.650
It was very
unselfish of you.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.322
Hey, thanks for
talking deputy dog

35:59.390 --> 36:02.425
Out of serious
jail time.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.860
You're welcome,
youngster.

36:03.928 --> 36:05.162
What's
the catch ?

36:05.229 --> 36:07.230
Probably a lecture,
right, Jordan ?

36:07.298 --> 36:09.599
No, he's not
too good at those.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.101
But, I'm gonna <i>try.</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:14.504
( motorcycle approaching )

36:16.340 --> 36:19.743
( Terry )
that's it, all off
who are gettin' off !

36:23.681 --> 36:25.615
Just around
the block ?

36:25.683 --> 36:28.251
Do you two girls even <i>know</i>
<i>what time it is ?</i>

36:28.319 --> 36:29.252
Yeah.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.489
It's time for the
marlins-reds game.

36:32.557 --> 36:33.823
Huh ?

36:33.891 --> 36:35.959
On your
satellite dish.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.128
It's been real !

36:38.196 --> 36:40.297
( Jordan )
did I miss something ?

36:40.364 --> 36:42.432
Tell me they weren't
robbing a bank ?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.734
They weren't
robbing a bank.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.003
Thank you.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.610
They're <i>still</i>
<i>talking ?</i>

36:53.678 --> 36:55.378
Probably
busting us.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.947
Not Terry.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.549
Give me those !
I can read lips.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.852
"live to ride."

37:02.920 --> 37:04.621
"ride to live."

37:04.689 --> 37:06.356
A way of life.

37:06.424 --> 37:08.058
"a way of life" ?

37:08.125 --> 37:10.000
That's just a logo
they use to sell the bike.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.728

no way.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.776
Way.

37:26.844 --> 37:27.844
Woof, woof !

37:27.912 --> 37:29.679
Whoa.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.248
Okay.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.085
You can--

<i>Cool, mom.</i>

38:15.626 --> 38:17.260
It won't <i>bite.</i>

38:18.362 --> 38:21.464
¶ c'est la vie
say the old folks ¶

38:21.532 --> 38:24.367
¶ it goes to show
you never can tell ¶

38:25.770 --> 38:29.072
¶ they had
a hi-fi phono ¶

38:29.140 --> 38:30.573
Put your feet on.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.310
If you'd like,
you can hang onto the back

38:33.377 --> 38:37.147
Or you can put your hands
around my waist.

38:37.214 --> 38:38.915
Okay.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.884
Whatever you like.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.053
Jordy, you listen to
Mrs. Rice, okay ?!

38:43.120 --> 38:45.422
Yes, father, sir !

38:45.489 --> 38:47.624
( starting bike )

38:49.460 --> 38:50.860
You okay ?

38:59.270 --> 39:00.603
Woof, woof !

39:00.671 --> 39:04.107
We are good.

39:08.579 --> 39:10.513
¶ c'est la vie
say the old folks ¶

39:10.581 --> 39:13.950
¶ it goes to show
you never can tell ¶

39:16.020 --> 39:19.522
( Judith )
we think you spend too much
time alone, Jordan.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.926
We've <i>gotta</i> do
something about it.

39:29.934 --> 39:32.435
( calypso music )

39:55.993 --> 39:58.194
Oh, he put it--

40:04.301 --> 40:05.835
I don't know
how to play poker.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.772
That's okay, Jordan,
we'll teach you.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.173
The main thing
you need to know

40:10.241 --> 40:11.875
Is you <i>have</i> to
bet something.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.843
But I don't
<i>have</i> any money.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.345
That's okay, too.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.480
I'm sure we can
think of <i>something.</i>

40:17.548 --> 40:20.116
Maybe we can
bet <i>chores</i> ?

40:20.184 --> 40:21.418
<i>Chores</i> !

40:21.485 --> 40:23.153
What <i>kind</i> of chores ?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.588
Stuff your parents make
you do around the house

40:25.656 --> 40:27.223
So they feel
you're useful.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.358
You know,
chores.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.294
I do <i>all</i> the chores
around here.

40:31.362 --> 40:34.564
You won't have to.
If you win, that is.

40:34.632 --> 40:35.965
Deal.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.270
This Claude guy--

40:40.337 --> 40:42.939
Do you <i>see</i> him ?

40:44.408 --> 40:46.476
Every day.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.611
Oh, really ?

40:48.679 --> 40:51.681
Really and
unfortunately.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.518
He's the head honcho
at the institute.

40:55.586 --> 40:57.320
I used to be
his assistant,

40:57.388 --> 41:00.190
But we had
a parting of the ways.

41:00.257 --> 41:03.626
Oh. Would it be tactless
to ask over what ?

41:03.694 --> 41:06.296
Third party.

41:06.363 --> 41:09.833
Oh, I apologize,
never mind--

41:09.900 --> 41:12.335
A dolphin.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.004
"a dolphin."

41:15.072 --> 41:17.774
I happened to think
that the dolphin

41:17.842 --> 41:20.643
Was more important
than <i>his</i> career.

41:20.711 --> 41:21.644
I agree.

41:21.712 --> 41:23.179
( man )
hey, c'mon,
join us !

41:23.247 --> 41:25.448
C'mon !

41:33.190 --> 41:36.292
You have three of a kind.
That's excellent.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.629
Yeah, but I have
the two of clubs.

41:39.697 --> 41:41.965
Two of clubs
beats <i>anything.</i>

41:43.167 --> 41:44.501
Sorry, man.

41:44.568 --> 41:47.570
Gonna have to
clean my room for a month.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.639
( Judith )
sorry.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.520
Whoa !

42:22.339 --> 42:25.775
Let's see, Jordan,
you've got tens and jacks.

42:25.843 --> 42:28.044
That's two pair.
That's real good--

42:28.112 --> 42:31.247
But, I have a three,
a five,

42:31.315 --> 42:34.317
A seven, a Jack
and a Queen.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.921
Cutthroat straight.
That beats <i>you,</i> sorry.

42:37.988 --> 42:40.957
You're gonna have to
water our plants for...

42:41.025 --> 42:43.293
Two weeks.

42:59.610 --> 43:01.210
We better
get going.

43:01.278 --> 43:03.379
We will...

43:03.447 --> 43:04.948
Eventually.

43:08.819 --> 43:11.821
You said that dolphins
are telepathic.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.225
How about people ?

43:18.462 --> 43:20.797
Some people.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.801
Your bet.

43:24.868 --> 43:26.703
Double
or nothing.

43:26.770 --> 43:29.005
I'm your slave
for the rest of the Summer

43:29.073 --> 43:31.307
Or we're back
to even.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.176
You sure ?

43:33.243 --> 43:35.178
I like to live
on the edge.

43:35.245 --> 43:38.214
Well, you just
crashed and burned.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.149
I have
a straight <i>flush.</i>

43:40.217 --> 43:43.119
Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah.

43:43.187 --> 43:45.388
And you know what ?

43:45.456 --> 43:48.958
This is
the two of clubs.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.029
No.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.064
How'd you
do that ?

43:55.132 --> 43:57.000
It's <i>all </i>
<i>in the wrist.</i>

44:22.359 --> 44:24.894
I had
a great time.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.729
You sound
surprised.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.297
I am.

44:28.365 --> 44:29.966
I mean,
no, no, no,

44:30.034 --> 44:31.567
Please,
I don't mean

44:31.635 --> 44:33.703
That I'm surprised
that I had a good time.

44:33.771 --> 44:36.372
I'm...

44:39.476 --> 44:41.944
For...

44:52.589 --> 44:54.390
She's really
into it.

45:03.133 --> 45:05.435
( Jordan )
give him a break,
he's a little Rusty.

45:05.502 --> 45:07.170
<i>More</i> than
a little.

45:44.374 --> 45:45.508
Yes !

45:58.155 --> 46:00.356
Woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof !

46:00.424 --> 46:01.724
Hey !

46:01.792 --> 46:03.893
Shh !

46:03.961 --> 46:05.661
Shut up !

46:05.729 --> 46:06.829
Get outta here !

46:06.897 --> 46:08.664
You get, get !

46:22.780 --> 46:24.113
Get out !

46:24.181 --> 46:26.616
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it !

46:34.024 --> 46:39.095
Woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof !

46:40.998 --> 46:42.498
Zeus !

46:45.402 --> 46:47.637
Zeus ?

46:51.642 --> 46:53.176
Damn.

47:00.417 --> 47:03.219
Okay, here I come.

47:19.269 --> 47:20.803
Zeus.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.243
What are
you doing ?

47:27.311 --> 47:29.278
Okay,

47:29.346 --> 47:31.914
You're a weird dog.

47:46.363 --> 47:49.265
It's the creature
from the black lagoon.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.934
Yeah, dressed
like Dr. Carver.

47:58.976 --> 48:01.611
Get me a towel !

48:01.678 --> 48:03.546
Creature, sir !

48:05.716 --> 48:08.784
( guitar riff )

48:11.488 --> 48:13.689
I think
they hear you.

48:13.757 --> 48:17.159
That's where
Roxanne should be.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.762
With <i>them.</i>

48:23.400 --> 48:25.468
Cool fish.

48:27.437 --> 48:29.372
I think you've
got yourself a band.

48:29.439 --> 48:30.940
Good job, mates !

48:31.008 --> 48:33.109
Rehearsal tomorrow,
same place, same time !

48:33.176 --> 48:34.710
Everybody sober !

48:34.778 --> 48:36.979
You know
dolphins.

48:37.047 --> 48:38.614
Yeah.

48:41.985 --> 48:44.687
I don't wanna
lose you, Terry.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.756
I don't wanna
lose me either.

48:53.563 --> 48:55.765
When are
you leaving ?

48:57.567 --> 48:59.969
I gotta go
to Boca Raton...

49:00.037 --> 49:02.872
For a week,
mix my tracks,

49:02.940 --> 49:04.941
Then it's off
to Boston

49:05.008 --> 49:09.612
And a regular job,
Jordan's in school.

49:11.381 --> 49:13.516
How 'bout you ?

49:13.583 --> 49:16.585
I'm here through the Summer
if I get my grant.

49:16.653 --> 49:19.088
And if you don't
get the grant ?

49:19.156 --> 49:23.793
Minnesota aquarium
tour guide.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.161
Ugh !

49:27.564 --> 49:29.999
Mary Beth won't share,
will she ?

49:30.067 --> 49:31.567
Neither will I !

49:31.635 --> 49:34.570
Inter-species
communication.

49:34.638 --> 49:37.540
I'll show <i>her</i>
<i>inter-species communication !</i>

49:39.810 --> 49:41.744
Let's start with her.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.080
She looks sickeningly
cute enough.

49:51.288 --> 49:54.056
( whimpering & yelping )

50:14.244 --> 50:16.645
( snoring )

51:01.558 --> 51:03.626
See ya.
See ya.

51:05.996 --> 51:07.763
I'd like to
thank you.

51:07.831 --> 51:09.732
Really, for what ?

51:09.800 --> 51:11.233
'cause we're going
down in the sub ?

51:11.301 --> 51:13.436
I should be
thanking <i>you.</i>

51:13.503 --> 51:16.038
No, I mean thanks
for helping Terry.

51:16.106 --> 51:19.308
He hasn't been able
to write in a long time.

51:32.456 --> 51:35.024
( Jordan )
Roxanne’s
so graceful.

51:42.833 --> 51:45.067
( Jordan )
oh, <i>cool.</i>

51:47.771 --> 51:50.606
( Mary Beth )
uh-oh, drift nets.

51:50.674 --> 51:53.776
They kill thousands
of dolphins every year.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.945
Where do they
come from ?

51:56.012 --> 51:57.980
Illegal fishermen.

51:58.048 --> 52:00.950
C'mon, let's lead
Roxanne outta here.

52:35.485 --> 52:37.720
( Jordan )
we're gonna <i>have</i> to
leave next week.

52:37.787 --> 52:40.422
There's a new
family moving in.

52:40.490 --> 52:42.158
You could stay
at <i>our</i> house.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.627
What about my dad ?

52:44.694 --> 52:47.196
( Judith )
we have two extra rooms.

52:47.264 --> 52:49.999
<i>Perfect.</i>

53:13.023 --> 53:15.791
Hey girls,
what brings <i>you</i> here ?

53:22.566 --> 53:25.301
You've burned
the school down.

53:30.907 --> 53:33.676
Then, why are
you here ?

53:42.686 --> 53:44.286
Thank you.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.123
Thank you.

53:49.392 --> 53:50.759
This looks good.

53:50.827 --> 53:52.127
Thank you.

53:54.531 --> 53:57.466
Okay, why are you two
eating salads ?

53:57.534 --> 54:00.069
You always
eat salad, mom.

54:00.136 --> 54:02.137
Why can can't <i>we</i>
<i>eat salad ?</i>

54:06.476 --> 54:09.044
I'm sorry,
no satellite dish.

54:09.112 --> 54:11.547
They're too expensive,
we can't afford it--

54:11.615 --> 54:14.717
No, mom,
it's not a satellite dish.

54:14.784 --> 54:18.053
It's really that
Terry and Jordan

54:18.121 --> 54:20.589
Need a place
to live for a while.

54:20.657 --> 54:23.859
We want them at our house.
We have two extra rooms.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.194
Yeah,
c'mon, mom.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.762
Whoa, whoa.

54:26.830 --> 54:29.832
Why do you think
they're even <i>interested</i>
<i>in staying at our house ?</i>

54:29.899 --> 54:30.966
Well, Jordan does.

54:31.034 --> 54:33.402
And so
does Terry.

54:33.470 --> 54:35.304
Says who ?

54:35.372 --> 54:37.873
Jordan told us.

54:42.178 --> 54:45.814
He told us
lots of stuff.

54:45.882 --> 54:47.916
Curious
to know, mom ?

54:56.559 --> 55:00.062
What <i>exactly </i>
<i>did they say ?</i>

55:00.130 --> 55:02.197
Okay, well--

55:02.265 --> 55:03.399
It started out...

55:03.466 --> 55:05.567
The rest of
the Summer ?

55:05.635 --> 55:07.469
You sure this was
Mary Beth’s idea ?

55:07.537 --> 55:09.738
And where are
my Twinkies ?!

55:09.806 --> 55:11.940
I made you
a fruit salad.

55:12.008 --> 55:14.443
It's in
the refrigerator.

55:14.511 --> 55:16.345
And of course,
it <i>was</i> her idea.

55:16.413 --> 55:17.880
You're <i>sure.</i>

55:17.947 --> 55:20.182
Absolutely.

55:20.250 --> 55:22.951
And dad,
use a spoon ?

55:23.019 --> 55:25.054
Mm-hmm.

55:25.855 --> 55:27.289
Right here,
I knew that.

55:28.058 --> 55:30.292
Now, before
we do this,

55:30.360 --> 55:32.661
There's a few things
you gotta know about me.

55:32.729 --> 55:34.029
Uh-oh.

55:34.097 --> 55:36.699
You one of these guys that
howls at the full Moon ?

55:36.766 --> 55:37.933
I'm afraid so.

55:38.001 --> 55:39.535
Oh, dear.

55:39.602 --> 55:41.537
It's a little late
to be reticent now.

55:41.604 --> 55:43.605
After all,
this was <i>your</i> idea.

55:43.673 --> 55:45.474
<i>My</i> idea ?

55:45.542 --> 55:46.642
Mm-hmm.

55:46.710 --> 55:49.078
Jordan said
it was--

55:49.145 --> 55:51.780
Jordan said
it was <i>your</i> idea for--

55:53.516 --> 55:56.585
No, the girls told <i>me </i>
<i>that you said--</i>

55:56.653 --> 55:58.921
No, I--

55:58.988 --> 56:01.190
We've been set <i>up.</i>

56:01.257 --> 56:04.426
By world-class
professionals.

56:22.645 --> 56:24.179
Well ?

56:24.247 --> 56:27.383
What are we gonna do,
professor ?

56:29.552 --> 56:30.886
Well...

56:33.690 --> 56:35.424
I <i>suppose...</i>

56:37.026 --> 56:40.396
If you stayed that I could
continue my work with Zeus.

56:40.463 --> 56:42.297
Mm-hmm, and...

56:42.365 --> 56:45.334
I could finish
my second act.

56:47.570 --> 56:49.671
So, I guess we'll
just have to

56:49.739 --> 56:51.907
Make the best of it.

56:54.210 --> 56:55.911
<i>Man,</i> we're good.

56:55.979 --> 56:57.312
Woof, woof !

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:48.164 --> 57:50.666
Should I take this stuff
next door now ?

57:50.733 --> 57:52.634
Just put it
outside first.

57:52.702 --> 57:54.303
Why ?

57:54.370 --> 57:57.039
'cause I said so.

57:57.106 --> 57:59.007
<i>Jeesh !</i>

58:05.014 --> 58:06.982
Lemonade ?

58:07.050 --> 58:08.851
No, thank you.

58:14.858 --> 58:16.992
What happened ?

58:18.795 --> 58:20.362
Nothing.

58:25.535 --> 58:28.337
What <i>didn't</i> happen ?

58:37.113 --> 58:38.714
Jordan ?

58:38.781 --> 58:41.049
It's gone south.

58:57.300 --> 59:00.903
What are we <i>doing</i> this for ?
Are we doing this for <i>us</i> ?

59:00.970 --> 59:03.405
Are we doing this for
the Rockland foundation ?

59:03.473 --> 59:06.508
Are we doing it
for the <i>kids</i> ?

59:06.576 --> 59:07.910
What ?

59:09.712 --> 59:11.713
All of the above.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.796
I don't know.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.201
I don't know.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.241
It's okay, just--

59:41.511 --> 59:44.413
Take as much time
as you need.

59:51.788 --> 59:54.289
( Jordan )
it's time
to go, Zeus.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.595
I don't
understand.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.965
If a dog and a dolphin
can get along

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.734
Why can't our mom
and his dad ?

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.087
( Zeus whining )

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.624
Woof, woof !

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.527
Zeus, <i>please.</i>

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:37.165
I feel
badly enough.

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.868
Then why don't you
turn around ?

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.405
I wish I could.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.340
I don't see
anyone <i>else</i> driving.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.409
Jordan !

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:41.129
Hey,
good morning, boss.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.772
Hey, you alright ?

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.678
What's wrong ?

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.516
They're gone.

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.821
So is Zeus.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.526
They're just gone.

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.833
Men and dogs, huh ?

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.234
C'mere.

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.405
It's okay.

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.843
<i>Oh.</i>

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.811
I could almost cry.

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.315
Tears of Joy.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.384
That dolphin
is fair game now,

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.053
Track her.

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.708
C'mon, Zeus.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.547
Zeus, c'mon.

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.155
<i>Zeus.</i>

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:50.525
<i>C'mon.</i>

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.939
What is she doing ?

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.740
I don't know.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.086
She's running away.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:07.829
She won't let us
near her anymore.

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.671
So much for inter-species
communication.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.673
That's what happens

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.842
When you work with these
animals in the wild.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.445
They can walk out on you
whenever they want to.

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:26.247
If we can bring Roxanne
back into the lab--

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.782
Dr. Carver,

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.985
It's illegal to catch
a dolphin in the open sea.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.720
Excuse <i>me,</i> Phil.

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:34.055
You know
he's right.

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:37.058
I'll replace Roxanne
with one of the simpletons,

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.594
Perhaps even <i>two.</i>

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:42.097
As scientists
we have to circumvent

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.200
These ridiculous
bureaucratic regulations.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.974
( man whistling )

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:14.396
Girls, dinner !

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:20.068
Feeding time at
the enrichment program.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.504
I resent that.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:25.473
Why do you treat us
like your little Einsteins ?

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.144
What do
you mean ?

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.546
Did <i>your</i> parents
ever send <i>you</i>

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:33.882
To an enrichment
program ?

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.751
No.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:39.320
C'mon, mom,
it's the <i>Summer.</i>

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.589
Enjoy it !

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.098
You're right.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.400
You're right.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.370
I guess I'm just trying
to <i>rush</i> everything too much.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:58.606
I'm trying to rush <i>you</i>
<i>into being little adults,</i>

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:01.609
I'm rushing Roxanne
back to the wild.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:06.981
Probably rushing <i>Terry</i> into
I don't <i>know</i> what.

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:09.250
Oh, no, mom,

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.886
We'll take

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.855
Some of the blame
for Terry.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.057
Actually, mom...

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.828
We'll take
most of the blame.

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:23.231
( Judith )
alright,
all of the blame.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.634
I was so close.

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.470
I was so close

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.706
To reintroducing
Roxanne into a pod.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.843
And then--

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.112
What happened
to Roxanne ?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.416
She's gone.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.585
She'll be back,
don't worry.

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.687
No, she won't.

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:48.189
She misses Zeus
too much.

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.059
Mom.

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.395
Zeus !

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.533
Zeus !

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:26.828
( phone rings )

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.496
Hello ?

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:29.863
It's me.

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.799
Yes ?

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.535
I see.

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:35.636
( Jordan )
anything ?

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:38.038
Nope, <i>nothing.</i>

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.108
I just <i>know</i> he's
trying to go back.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.377
That is
unbelievable.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.179
That's like <i>scary.</i>

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.948
I think it's time to take
Jurassic measures.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.884
I agree.
What do we have to lose ?

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:53.154
Alright,
who is that ?

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:54.822
Hi.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.992
Can you please
hold on a second ?

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:00.895
Dad.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.197
It's for you, mom.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.531
Who is it ?

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.500
It's Jane freeman

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:06.935
From the
record company.

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:10.071
It's somebody selling
cemetery plots.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:13.374
Mom, get the phone.
Hello ?

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.777
Hello, gorgeous.

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.779
I had a dream about <i>you</i>
<i>last night.</i>

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.013
You did ?

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.748
Oh, yeah.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.750
We went all the way,
positively platinum.

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.619
Oh.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:27.188
I had a dream about
you too last night

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:29.591
And we went
resoundingly tin.

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.294
Hello, Terry.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.066
They don't give up
too easily, do they ?

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.701
No, they <i>do</i> not.

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.505
I heard about Zeus.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.275
I heard
about Roxanne.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.946
She's pretty hurt.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.922
So is he.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.591
I mean, I think
she'll get over it.

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.293
Maybe...

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:09.464
We can give it
a little more time.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.300
We'll talk.

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:13.768
Yeah.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.870
Tomorrow ?

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.605
Yeah.

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:20.174
Yeah, tomorrow
would be great.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.076
Alright.

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:23.177
Okay.

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.846
Bye.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.014
Bye.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:27.815
Hello ?

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:30.285
Hello ?

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:31.352
Goodbye.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.521
Okay, bye.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:36.691
Hello.

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.395
Alright,
you hang up first.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.729
Mm-mm.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.299
How 'bout we
hang up together ?

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.067
I'll say bye

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.802
And on one, two, three,
we hang up.

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.771
Okay, bye.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.005
One, two,

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.473
Three.

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.178
Hello ?

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.479
( dial tone )

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.815
She hung up on me.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.654
Breakfast.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.494
Jordy !

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:49.430
I woke up and
I wanna smell the coffee !

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.733
Jordy ?

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.879
( Jordan )
hi, dad, it's me.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:07.615
I've gone to
look for Zeus.

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.854
Hi, dad, it's me.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.522
I've gone to
look for Zeus.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.758
( PA In background )
the white zone is for

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:19.060
Loading and unloading
of passengers...

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.628
Oh, <i>shoot.</i>

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.768
( phone rings )

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.003
Hello.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.571
Mary Beth,
it's Becky.

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:33.441
I know it's Sunday but I thought
you should know about this.

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:34.776
Know what ?

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:38.012
I came to the office to
check up on a few things and--

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.114
And <i>what,</i> Becky ?

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.750
Claude carver
was just in.

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.319
He said they found a dolphin
caught in drift nets...

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.989
Dead.

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.425
It's not Roxanne.

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:53.261
I've gotta
find her, Becky.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.530
Right.

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.732
No more
Mr. Nice guy.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.705
Look who's back.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:40.341
Now Roxanne
is ours.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.943
No, Dr. Carver.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:43.177
Yours.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.779
We quit.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.748
No, you don't.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:50.084
You're <i>fired</i> !

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.286
We got a date
with a dolphin.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.602
Excuse me, sir !

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:10.538
How would you like to be part
of scientific history ?!

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:17.144
Can I interest you
in a case of rum ?

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.720
Enjoy your flight.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.890
Next in line.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:32.326
( Jordan )
do you have
standby ?

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.265
What ?

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.534
Do you have
standby ?

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:43.538
And do you have a good reason
for being here ?

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.573
Uh-oh.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:11.265
Take us to 0-3-5
full throttle !

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.702
This mongrel
is the perfect bait !

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.038
Roxanne will
come to <i>us</i> !

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.252
( beeping )

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:33.955
Yes !

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:36.190
We got her !

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.126
Ah, my foot !

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.136
You know, Jordy,

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:51.839
We're gonna do everything
we can to find Zeus

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.208
But it's extremely unlikely
he made it down here.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.443
Dad,

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.846
Zeus is an
extremely extreme dog.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.481
That he is.

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:02.617
( Jordan )
he's also in love.

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:05.119
( Terry )
an extreme emotion.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.156
Why don't you
try it sometime, dad ?

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.138
It's okay.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.080
( Judith )
Jordan !

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.882
Jordan !

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.183
C'mon !

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:38.319
Cab's waiting.
Let's go.

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.488
Mind if I
tag along ?

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:41.555
C'mon !

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.016
Becky.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.952
There's something
you should know.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.021
It's about
Dr. Carver.

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.608
Hey, girls,
Terry,

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.543
What are you
guys doing here ?

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.645
Where's my mom ?
Her boat's gone.

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.315
She's out
looking for Roxanne.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.766
C'mon, Roxanne.

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.956
Ready the net.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.540
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.641
( Zeus barking )
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.641 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.253
Ready...

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:27.488
Now !

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.091
You missed,
you idiot !

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.493
Get it back up !

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.328
Get it up, fool !

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.230
C'mon, move, move !

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.563
Get me out !

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:14.034
You stupid dog.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:28.369
Mom ?

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:29.570
Mom !

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.539
( Nora )
mom !

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:33.774
Mom !

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:38.245
( Jordan )
flags up,
she's down in the sub.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.114
How long can she
stay down there ?

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:42.483
45 minutes
I think.

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.039
Roxanne.

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.373
Roxanne.

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:10.077
( Mary Beth )
yes, Roxanne.

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:50.451
I think she wants you
to follow her.

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.726
Get me a knife !

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.291
You okay ?

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.659
Roxanne.

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:51.198
( Jordan )
c'mon !

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.533
( Claude )
good dog,
yes, yes,

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:56.270
That's a good dog.

01:27:57.905 --> 01:27:59.273
No !

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:03.010
( Claude )
you mongrel !

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.447
Stay, stay.

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:10.083
What are you doing ?
No, no, no !

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:25.332
Officer,
arrest this dog !

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.835
Oh, we will.

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:31.672
Free Dr. Carver,
and then arrest him.

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:34.875
I confess,
it was all him !

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:37.344
What are you talking about,
you idiot ?!

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:39.880
I'll kill you !

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.955
Atta boy, Zeus.

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:59.099
( man across street )
I'm waiting !

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.967
How do you like
your new neighbors ?

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.070
I liked the
old ones better.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:06.406
I'm gonna
take a shower.

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.975
I'm gonna
make some coffee.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.082
Don't do that
again, okay ?

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:43.744
We believe that with
all that's happened

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.746
It's clearly
established that

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.014
You <i>do </i>
<i>like our mom.</i>

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:50.650
Of course I do.

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:53.520
Enough to <i>marry</i> her ?

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.859
How 'bout
next Sunday ?

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:12.072
Where do you
keep the coffee ?

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.422
At this point,
if there's anyone here

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:31.024
That has any reason
that this marriage

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.527
Between Mary Beth Dunhill
and Terrence Paul Barnett

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.562
Shall not
take place,

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:39.766
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.868
( man )
wait !

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.870
Wait !

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:47.107
Sorry, they told me to bring
this down here right away.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.042
Better offer ?

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.480
It's the grant !

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:54.981
( Jordan )
good going, Mary Beth--

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.983
I mean <i>mom.</i>

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.052
Now I suppose
you can kiss the bride.

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.524
What's going on ?

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:15.061
I think...

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:17.197
He's telling her
it's time.

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:21.801
Go on, girl.
It's your turn.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.801
}}
