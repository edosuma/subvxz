WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.375
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.375 --> 00:06.291
-Cyclops is waiting for me.
-So am I.

00:06.291 --> 00:08.125
[Rogue]
Where the heck
are the lovebirds?

00:08.125 --> 00:10.333
[Gambit]
Who cares?
Let them be alone for a change.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.750
[growling]

00:12.333 --> 00:15.291
[Xavier]
This is as close as I can
pinpoint their location.

00:17.583 --> 00:20.291
Pay the price
for attacking Morlocks.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.583
Scott and Jean pick one strange
romantic hideaway, non?

00:25.583 --> 00:26.958
Shut up.

00:28.458 --> 00:31.166
Welcome. I am Callisto.

00:31.166 --> 00:32.291
Where's Jean?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.291
[Wolverine roaring]

00:37.166 --> 00:38.875
Jean. You okay?

00:38.875 --> 00:40.500
[Jean]
Cyclops. Oh, no!

00:41.583 --> 00:43.333
[sobbing]

00:43.333 --> 00:45.250
Destroy the X-Men.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.416
[Morlocks screaming]

00:51.333 --> 00:52.333
You've lost.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.583
Wolverine? Jean and I wanted
to thank you for...

00:58.083 --> 00:59.083
[Jean]
He's gone.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.458
[theme song playing]

02:00.250 --> 02:03.833
[Cyclops]
Why would Wolverine just leave
without telling anyone?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.583
[Jean]
Well, he must have had
a good reason.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.291
I don't buy that, Jean.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.833
You know that temper of his.
If he doesn't get his way,
he's gone.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.000
We can never depend on him.

02:13.583 --> 02:16.458
With hotheads like Wolverine,
maybe we never will.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.250
Any guy who'd run out
on his friends...

02:19.250 --> 02:20.416
Cyclops.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.125
I...

02:23.958 --> 02:26.083
He left because of me.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.875
[wind howling]

02:41.000 --> 02:42.833
[exhales]

02:42.833 --> 02:45.458
There's no place like home.

02:55.625 --> 02:59.458
[Sabretooth]
I've tracked you far enough,
Wolverine.

03:01.375 --> 03:02.708
[screaming]

03:03.708 --> 03:06.875
[Sabretooth]
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

03:06.875 --> 03:10.958
[Wolverine]
Sabretooth.
I should've smelled you coming.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.000
You've lost it, pal.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.708
Ten years ago,
I never could have got
this close.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.500
I can still handle
punks like you.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
Enough.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.875
[screaming]

04:02.625 --> 04:07.250
[Sabretooth]
You thought you and your
pitiful X-Men could stop me?

04:08.125 --> 04:12.125
Goodbye, old friend.

04:14.875 --> 04:18.125
Let the ice be your tombstone.

04:18.125 --> 04:22.625
Here lies Wolverine,
alone and defeated.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.125
[laughing]

04:25.875 --> 04:27.208
No!

04:27.708 --> 04:30.458
You won't cheat me
of my revenge.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.875
[grunting]

04:41.291 --> 04:44.500
Not even your mutant
healing powers

04:44.500 --> 04:48.125
can keep you alive
on a chunk of ice
in the middle of the Arctic.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.291
At least I won't have to listen
to your flapping mouth anymore.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.375
[Sabretooth]
You'll die frozen and alone.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.750
But I'll track you down

04:59.750 --> 05:04.208
just for the pleasure
of burying your bones.

05:05.708 --> 05:09.458
[Cyclops]
I won't have you spreading lies
and disrupting the team.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.458
[Gambit]
You afraid you'll lose your job?

05:11.458 --> 05:13.375
You won't be leader no more?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.208
You either follow orders
like the other members
of this team.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.416
-Or you're out of it.
-Cyclops.

05:18.416 --> 05:21.333
If you want to settle this,
mon ami, then let's do it.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.416
Gambit. What started this?

05:25.416 --> 05:28.583
Ask Cyclops. He's the one
with all the answers.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.875
I'm sorry, Professor,
but I thought it was dangerous

05:31.875 --> 05:34.333
for Gambit to spread
unfounded rumors.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.833
It's not a rumor.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.625
I know someone who was there.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.208
The Genoshans,
they welcome mutants
to their island.

05:40.208 --> 05:43.291
I just say check it out
and this one gets mad.

05:43.291 --> 05:45.208
You're as bad as Wolverine.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.625
You just want to get away
to lie around on a beach.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.583
Hmm, that's not
such a bad idea.

05:50.208 --> 05:53.208
You've all been
under a lot of stress lately.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.458
For the good of the team,
maybe we all need
a chance to unwind.

05:56.458 --> 06:00.166
And if
the inhabitants of Genosha
are encouraging mutants

06:00.166 --> 06:03.375
to live among them,
this is an opportunity
we can't miss.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.208
Genosha could be an example
for the world.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.500
That would be incredible.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.708
Select three X-Men, Cyclops

06:11.708 --> 06:14.708
and send them to investigate
Genosha for us.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.875
And you try to relax a little.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.291
OK, Storm,
you'll head the team,
seconded by Gambit.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.250
[Gambit speaking French]

06:25.958 --> 06:28.375
Please, Cyclops, can I go?
Please?

06:28.958 --> 06:32.250
Sure, Jubilee,
I guess a beach
can't be too dangerous.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.583
You'll take a commercial
flight to Genosha.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.166
Your cover
is that you're tourists.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.250
All right, team.
We have a great deal
to do to get ready.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.375
Oh, gosh, what'll I wear?

06:43.375 --> 06:48.000
Remember, act like tourists,
but keep your eyes open.
You're on a mission.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Relax, Cyclops.
All work and no play
make Jacques a dull boy.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.958
Maybe we could all use
a vacation.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.250
Yeah, from Gambit.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.583
[groaning]

07:06.583 --> 07:08.458
He's alive.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.291
If we take him
to the government settlement

07:10.291 --> 07:12.416
there should be a reward
for our trouble.

07:12.416 --> 07:15.291
Maybe enough
for a new snowmobile.

07:15.291 --> 07:18.625
Our way is to help
a stranger, Kiyoek.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.291
Not to use him
to beg for money.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.416
We'll take him to our camp.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.458
We can tend
to the stranger there.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.458
You heard Pooyetah.

07:28.125 --> 07:30.250
The words of the elders are law.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.083
[motor humming]

07:38.625 --> 07:40.875
A motor? Out here?

07:46.500 --> 07:50.500
You have a coward's luck,
Wolverine.

07:58.583 --> 08:03.583
What? Where am I?
Who are you?

08:03.583 --> 08:07.416
I am Pooyetah,
elder of this camp.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.833
But save your strength.
You need rest.

08:10.833 --> 08:14.250
You almost died in the cold,
stranger.

08:14.250 --> 08:20.000
Call me Wolverine.
And I'm fine now, almost...

08:20.000 --> 08:23.583
No man recovers from the ice
so fast.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.625
Yeah, well, I'm a...

08:25.625 --> 08:28.375
You don't know, do you?
You've never heard of us.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.583
-I don't understand.
-Good.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.458
Let's just say
I'm a fast healer.

08:34.458 --> 08:37.375
A little work will help
get the kinks out of my system.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.625
Besides, I owe you something
for saving my life.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.375
[man on PA]
First call. All passengers.

08:44.375 --> 08:48.583
Pan Air Flight 917,
now boarding at Gate 32.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.625
That's our flight.
We'd better hurry.

08:50.625 --> 08:53.750
All right.
Genosha, here we come.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.375
I hope I brought
the right clothes.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.375
I've never been to a resort
before.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.291
Don't worry, little one.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.375
All you need's a swimsuit
and some sunscreen.

09:03.416 --> 09:06.458
Just do as you're told
and stay out of the way.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.166
It takes skill
to handle the nets.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.416
You mean like this?

09:13.708 --> 09:15.416
[men exclaiming]

09:16.708 --> 09:18.416
It's all in the wrist.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.958
You'll see how well
the Inuit fish...

09:23.208 --> 09:25.000
[Wolverine laughing]

09:25.958 --> 09:28.958
Reminds me of the story
about the one that got away.

09:30.416 --> 09:33.416
But I never put much stock
in fish stories.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.416
[men laughing]

09:45.166 --> 09:49.208
This is the best catch
since the big ships
came from the south

09:49.208 --> 09:50.583
and took all the fish.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.750
We were lucky today.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.000
Where do I put these?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.083
The stranger has the strength
of a polar bear.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.833
He's not so strong.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.750
[grunting]

10:06.416 --> 10:07.458
[straining] See?

10:14.458 --> 10:16.458
[Pooyetah]
The people are happy tonight...

10:17.875 --> 10:19.125
because of you.

10:20.208 --> 10:24.000
They've made me happy, too.
I don't know how to handle it.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.958
It feels so strange

10:26.625 --> 10:27.875
I feel...

10:28.583 --> 10:30.000
at peace.

10:31.291 --> 10:36.583
No man seeks peace so hard
as one who does not have it
in his heart.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.000
I wish I could tell you.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.458
Only you can decide
when the time is right

10:43.458 --> 10:45.250
then you will speak.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.250
Thanks.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.875
Come, Wolverine.
It's your turn to celebrate.

10:49.875 --> 10:54.458
Oh, no, no,
you've got the wrong guy.
I get airsick.

10:54.458 --> 10:59.458
[chuckling]
We all need to forget ourselves
and be a child again.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.583
Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.833
[Wolverine exclaims]

11:08.583 --> 11:10.083
Hey. Watch it.

11:10.708 --> 11:12.500
Come on, now.

11:15.750 --> 11:19.208
I was the one they cheered
before Wolverine.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.708
[people laughing]

11:21.708 --> 11:23.750
Now he's their hero.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.708
A stranger.

11:26.708 --> 11:28.500
[Sabretooth growling]

11:28.500 --> 11:29.500
[gasps]

11:33.500 --> 11:35.250
[sniffing]

11:35.250 --> 11:39.500
You have the stink
of Wolverine all around you.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.583
I did not believe.
A snow demon.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.250
The friends of my enemies

11:51.250 --> 11:54.416
are my enemies!

11:57.125 --> 12:00.000
No!
The stranger is not my friend.

12:00.875 --> 12:05.583
I was leader of the young men,
but now they follow
only Wolverine.

12:05.583 --> 12:06.875
The women laugh at me.

12:07.583 --> 12:10.583
Wolverine has made me
a fool to my own people.

12:13.125 --> 12:17.875
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, human?

12:17.875 --> 12:21.958
Never. The snow demons
can read the truth
in your eyes.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.291
I'm no snow demon.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.958
I'm a mutant,
just like Wolverine.

12:29.375 --> 12:30.583
I don't understand.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.708
You only have to understand
one thing...

12:33.708 --> 12:35.708
revenge.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.583
-You want Wolverine gone?
-Yes.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.958
Then do what I say.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.583
[woman on PA]
Pan Air Flight 917,
now arriving.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.375
Welcome to Genosha.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.583
Would he say that if he knew
we were mutants?

12:54.166 --> 12:55.958
[Storm]
That's what we're here
to find out.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.208
[Jubilee]
I can't wait to get down
to the beach.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.250
This place is like a dream.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.625
Welcome
to the Genosha Beach Inn.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.583
We hope you enjoy your stay
with us.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.416
I'll just check to make sure
your bungalow's ready.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.333
Hey. Check this out.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.625
[Gambit reads the sign]

13:18.625 --> 13:21.625
What do you think?
We save maybe
10%, n'est-ce pas?

13:22.250 --> 13:24.625
Just put it back, Gambit.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.875
You're no fun to travel with.

13:31.458 --> 13:35.291
I've got the perfect rooms
for you. Just perfect.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.458
I'm sure you'll find your stay
interesting.
[bell rings]

13:38.083 --> 13:40.208
Show our guests to Bungalow 12.

13:42.708 --> 13:46.333
I just want to get
into my swimsuit and down
to the beach.

13:47.875 --> 13:51.291
New arrivals.
I think you'll like them.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.708
[Kiyoek]
Only a coward
sits on the shore.

13:57.708 --> 14:00.958
Are you brave enough to hunt
with me on the open sea?

14:00.958 --> 14:04.375
Wolverine has nothing
to prove to you, Kiyoek.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.583
But what about to someone else?

14:06.583 --> 14:09.583
An old enemy or an old friend.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.333
Your jealousy
has made you stupid.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.708
It's all right, Pooyetah.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.166
I accept your challenge, Kiyoek.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.875
I think we've come far enough.

14:23.708 --> 14:26.583
We still have far to go
to the hunting ground.

14:26.583 --> 14:29.208
The hunt ends here, Kiyoek.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.416
You didn't bring me
out here to look for seals.

14:32.416 --> 14:34.000
What's really going on?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.583
You are a mutant.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.708
Who told you about mutants?

14:39.708 --> 14:41.708
I, I don't...

14:41.708 --> 14:43.458
[explosion]

14:43.458 --> 14:44.583
The fishing camp.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.166
What happened?

14:56.958 --> 14:58.083
[sniffing]

14:58.625 --> 15:00.166
I knew it.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.875
Sabretooth.

15:01.875 --> 15:05.333
There's no peace for me,
even here.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.125
This is all my fault.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.625
[Kiyoek]
No, Wolverine.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.083
I thought you made the people
laugh at me.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.333
I wanted revenge.

15:14.958 --> 15:17.291
The other stranger said
lead you away from camp.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.208
I thought to lead you
into a trap

15:22.208 --> 15:24.458
but I didn't know about this.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.875
You miserable...

15:27.750 --> 15:30.208
No, you didn't do this.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.333
I thought I could forget
what I've been.

15:35.125 --> 15:38.500
Some things you just
have to face...

15:38.500 --> 15:40.000
alone.

15:52.583 --> 15:56.000
All right, Sabretooth.
What are you doing here?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.375
These are my people.
I must find them.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.875
Your fight is my fight now.

16:01.875 --> 16:06.083
The glacier's too dangerous
for you, and so is Sabretooth.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.250
No.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.875
[Sabretooth]
Wolverine.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.333
What's wrong, old man?

16:12.333 --> 16:15.458
My fun interrupt your fishing?

16:15.458 --> 16:18.708
What have you done
with Pooyetah and the others?

16:18.708 --> 16:22.291
I always like to have an edge
in a fight.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.250
Your friends are over there.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.250
What?
[Kiyoek gasps]

16:26.833 --> 16:28.250
[Sabretooth]
It's only a coward like you

16:28.250 --> 16:30.458
who would care
about these people.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.250
You've got one minute
to save 'em.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.875
All you got to do
is come through me.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.708
Let them go, Sabretooth.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.291
I don't want to fight you
anymore.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.208
I don't care who started it.

16:45.958 --> 16:48.125
It's time to bury it.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.583
I'll bury it, all right.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.291
Look out!

16:59.875 --> 17:01.875
[Sabretooth]
You've gone soft, Wolverine.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.500
Xavier's got you
kissing up to these scum.

17:05.291 --> 17:09.875
This is the last battleground
for one of us.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.833
[roaring]

17:14.708 --> 17:16.291
[both grunts]

17:21.208 --> 17:24.833
You always were slower than me.

17:24.833 --> 17:27.000
Give it up, Sabretooth.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.125
Never!

17:30.333 --> 17:31.375
[screams]

17:32.000 --> 17:33.333
My eyes.

17:35.208 --> 17:39.708
You were never a match
for me, Wolverine.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.583
This time I'm making sure.

17:49.583 --> 17:54.458
It's always hard to say goodbye
to an old friend.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.750
No!

17:58.333 --> 18:01.583
You should have stayed
out of my way, insect.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.208
Be nice to the guy, Sabretooth.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.375
He's our host.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.375
[screaming]

18:16.208 --> 18:20.750
Lots of luck, pal.
Stay gone this time.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.708
[Pooyetah]
No. There is no time.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.375
[Wolverine]
We'll make time.

18:43.583 --> 18:46.500
[Wolverine]
Because of me, your people
have lost their village.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.833
I want to help you rebuild it.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.375
[Pooyetah]
Thank you, my friend.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.583
But we are moving on.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.500
For years, many have wanted
to move to the city.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.583
Now they have their wish.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.583
The old ways are no more.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.375
The young ones
will have to find a new way

19:06.375 --> 19:07.875
for the people to live.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.375
You called me friend.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.125
[Jubilee]
I could live at the beach
forever.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.166
I don't ever want to go home.

19:14.166 --> 19:17.416
You said it, chere.
This is my kind of mission.

19:17.833 --> 19:21.416
The Genoshans'
acceptance of mutants
seems to be genuine.

19:21.416 --> 19:24.416
But we still have a great deal
of checking to do.

19:25.458 --> 19:26.958
I suggest we go to our rooms

19:26.958 --> 19:30.291
finish unpacking
and get some sleep.

19:30.291 --> 19:33.458
I'll unpack, but I don't think
I'll be able to sleep.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.708
I've never seen Jubilee
so happy.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.375
Maybe Genosha isa paradise.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.583
[coughing]

19:50.583 --> 19:54.500
[Jubilee]
Gas! Storm, Gambit...

19:54.500 --> 19:56.416
What's happening?

19:57.708 --> 19:58.875
We've got to get out.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.500
[all coughing]

20:04.583 --> 20:07.375
[Genoshan commander]
Surrender, mutants.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.416
No, Gambit.
We cannot endanger human life.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.708
Maybe you can't.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.875
[all clamoring]

20:41.375 --> 20:42.375
[Jubilee]
No!

20:46.958 --> 20:48.458
[closing theme song]
