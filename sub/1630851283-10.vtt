We go further, so you can.
>> NATIONWIDE SINCE LAST YEAR,

00:13.580 --> 00:22.288
THERE HAS BEEN A 53% INCREASE IN
THE MURDERS OF POLICE OFFICERS.
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE DEALING
WITH GROWING RESIGNATIONS, TOO.

00:22.355 --> 00:29.929
SO, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
"DEFUNDING THE POLICE" MAY HELP?
>> THE ADAGE HAS BEEN IN
LAW ENFORCEMENT SINCE FOREVER:

00:29.996 --> 00:35.668
80% OF WHAT WE DO HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.
IT'S ALL SOCIAL WORK.
THE KITTEN-UP-THE-TREE STUFF--

00:35.735 --> 00:40.106
DO YOU<i> NEED</i> A BADGE AND A GUN
FOR THAT?
AND WE'RE STARTING TO CUT AWAY
AT THE THINGS WE'VE ASKED LAW

00:40.173 --> 00:44.511
ENFORCEMENT TO DO, THAT THEY
DON'T WANT TO DO.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> THIS IS IT?

00:44.577 --> 00:49.783
>> THAT'S IT.
>> OH, WOW.
IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO TRAVEL
BY AIR OVER THE HOLIDAYS--

00:49.849 --> 00:57.791
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE--
WOULD YOU JUMP AT THE CHANCE
TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION IN
HALF THE TIME?

00:57.857 --> 01:04.164
>> WHEN I LOOK SEVERAL DECADES
OUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT I WANT IS
TO BE ABLE TO BE ANYWHERE IN
THE WORLD IN FOUR HOURS, FOR

01:04.230 --> 01:09.702
100 BUCKS.
NOW, THAT'S NOT WHERE WE START.
BUT THAT'S THE END GOAL.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:09.769 --> 01:13.673
>> THAT'S THE TEMPLE OF CASTOR
AND POLLUX?
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
>> THE ROMAN EMPIRE CENTERED

01:13.740 --> 01:19.512
AROUND CONQUESTS, AND THE
OUTSIZED PERSONALITIES OF ITS
EMPERORS.
RESEARCH AND ARCHEOLOGY CONTINUE

01:19.579 --> 01:26.352
TO SEARCH FOR RELIABLE EVIDENCE
FROM THAT TIME.
AND TONIGHT, WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOME NEW DISCOVERIES ABOUT

01:26.419 --> 01:32.992
ONE OF THE MOST WRITTEN ABOUT,
IF NOT MISUNDERSTOOD, EMPERORS
OF ALL TIME:
CALIGULA.

01:33.059 --> 01:38.264
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE
SITTING ON THE STEPS THAT
CALIGULA MAY HAVE WALKED ON.
IT'S AMAZING.

THOSE STORIES, TONIGHT, ON

01:50.310 --> 02:06.392
"60 MINUTES."
>> Pelley: THIS PAST WEEK,
THE KYLE RITTENHOUSE TRIAL WAS
A SHARP REMINDER OF 2020'S

02:06.459 --> 02:13.933
SUMMER OF PROTEST AGAINST
POLICE VIOLENCE.
AFTER A POLICE SHOOTING OF
JACOB BLAKE IN WISCONSIN LAST

02:14.000 --> 02:21.841
YEAR, RITTENHOUSE, THEN 17, SHOT
AND KILLED TWO DEMONSTRATORS,
AND WOUNDED ANOTHER.
JACOB BLAKE'S SHOOTING CAME

02:21.908 --> 02:29.215
NOT LONG AFTER THE POLICE
KILLINGS OF BREONNA TAYLOR AND
GEORGE FLOYD.
PROTESTS PITTED SUPPORTERS OF

02:29.282 --> 02:36.990
"DEFUND THE POLICE" AGAINST
THOSE WHO "BACKED THE BLUE."
AND WITH A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN
VIOLENT CRIME, PROGRESS ON

02:37.056 --> 02:43.930
REFORM STALLED.
BUT, PHILLIP ATIBA GOFF SEES A
WAY FORWARD.
HE'S A YALE SOCIAL SCIENTIST

02:43.997 --> 02:54.374
WHO'S BEEN ADVISING POLICE
DEPARTMENTS FOR 14 YEARS.
GOFF'S WORK HAS SHOWN THAT
JUSTICE AND SAFETY CAN BE FOUND

02:54.440 --> 03:00.680
IN CITIES THAT ARE REIMAGINING
POLICE.
>> Phillip Atiba Goff: WE FOCUS
ON MAKING POLICING LESS DEADLY,

03:00.747 --> 03:06.519
LESS RACIST, AND OFTEN, JUST
LESS PRESENT.
AND WE LEVERAGE DATA AND
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE TO DO ALL OF

03:06.586 --> 03:11.758
THAT.
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES, A SCIENTIFIC
PROCESS IS ONE YOU CAN TRUST
WHEN YOU CAN'T TRUST EACH OTHER.

03:11.824 --> 03:18.298
>> Pelley: PHILLIP GOFF IS A
PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN
STUDIES, WITH A Ph.D. IN
PSYCHOLOGY.

03:18.364 --> 03:26.673
HE'S C.E.O. OF THE CENTER FOR
POLICING EQUITY, WHICH ANALYZES
POLICE DATA, 911 CALLS, ARRESTS,
AND TRAFFIC STOPS, TO HELP

03:26.739 --> 03:35.982
CITIES REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITY
AND THE USE OF FORCE.
LAS VEGAS IS ONE EXAMPLE.
LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT CAME

03:36.049 --> 03:42.555
TO YOU.
WHAT WAS THEIR QUESTION?
>> Goff: LAS VEGAS METRO, THEY
SAID, "WE THINK WE MIGHT BE

03:42.622 --> 03:46.125
USING TOO MUCH FORCE."
I SAID, "WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?"
THEY SAID, "BECAUSE OUR
COMMUNITY TELLS US SO."

03:46.192 --> 03:50.463
I SAID, "THAT'S A GOOD
INDICATION."
>> Pelley: GOFF DISCOVERED,
MOST USE OF FORCE IN VEGAS CAME

03:50.530 --> 03:56.135
AFTER FOOT CHASES.
>> Goff: SO LITERALLY, THEY
STARTED TRAINING THEIR OFFICERS,
YOU'RE HIGH ON ADRENALINE, YOU

03:56.202 --> 04:01.941
SLOW IT DOWN, YOU COUNT TO TEN.
DON'T TOUCH THE PERSON TILL THE
BACKUP SHOWS UP.
THEY DROPPED THEIR USE OF FORCE

04:02.008 --> 04:09.649
BY 23% THE NEXT MONTH.
AND IT STAYED LOW, AND IT BECAME
A NATIONAL MODEL FOR TRAINING IN
FOOT PURSUITS.

04:09.716 --> 04:17.824
>> Pelley: IN BERKLEY,
CALIFORNIA, GOFF FOUND THE
LARGEST RACIAL BIAS WAS IN
LOW-LEVEL TRAFFIC STOPS, LIKE

04:17.890 --> 04:23.830
BROKEN TAILLIGHTS.
SO, BERKELEY STOPPED ENFORCING
MINOR VIOLATIONS.
>> Goff: THE PLACES WHERE WE

04:23.896 --> 04:28.468
WORK, WE SEE ABOUT A 26%
REDUCTION IN USE OF FORCE AFTER
WE WERE THERE.
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS

04:28.534 --> 04:34.540
US, BUT ALL THE THINGS THEY
TRIED TOGETHER-- ABOUT A
QUARTER, RIGHT, OF THE USE OF
FORCE GOES AWAY.

04:34.607 --> 04:40.813
BUT, IN THIS MOMENT, WHAT WE'RE
GETTING ASKED FOR IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.
NOT "HOW DO WE MAKE POLICING

04:40.880 --> 04:47.053
BETTER," BUT "HOW DO WE REMOVE
POLICING FROM THE PLACES WHERE
WE HAVE ABANDONED COMMUNITIES,
AND SO WE ASK POLICE TO PUNISH

04:47.120 --> 04:52.291
PEOPLE WHO WE'VE ABANDONED FOR
GENERATIONS."
THAT'S THE THING THAT'S COMING
NEXT.

04:52.358 --> 04:58.731
>> Pelley: TO SEE WHAT'S COMING
NEXT, WE WENT TO THE CAPITAL OF
TEXAS.
PROFESSOR GOFF IS NOT ADVISING

04:58.798 --> 05:06.873
AUSTIN, BUT THIS LIBERAL CITY OF
ONE MILLION IS FAR ALONG IN
POLICE REFORM, EVEN AGAINST THE
RESERVATIONS OF THE CONSERVATIVE

05:06.939 --> 05:13.813
STATE LEGISLATURE.
>> BLACK LIVES MATTER!
BLACK LIVES MATTER!
>> Pelley: WHEN GEORGE FLOYD WAS

05:13.880 --> 05:19.952
MURDERED IN MINNEAPOLIS IN 2020,
AUSTIN WAS ALREADY SMOLDERING
OVER TWO POLICE KILLINGS OF ITS
OWN.

05:20.019 --> 05:29.295
TWO COPS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER
IN SHOOTINGS, NINE MONTHS APART,
OF A MENTAL PATIENT, AND AN
UNARMED MAN WHO WAS BLACK AND

05:29.362 --> 05:37.937
LATINO.
IN A DEMONSTRATION IN JULY, AN
ARMED BLACK LIVES MATTER
PROTESTER WAS SHOT AND KILLED...

05:38.004 --> 05:43.943
(<i> GUNFIRE</i> )
...BY A MAN WHO DROVE HIS CAR
INTO THE MARCH.
THE SHOOTER IS CHARGED WITH

05:44.010 --> 05:54.320
MURDER.
AT THE PEAK OF THE UNREST, THE
CITY COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY
TO CUT THE POLICE BUDGET 25%--

05:54.387 --> 06:02.562
ABOUT $150 MILLION.
THE IDEA WAS TO PREVENT CRIME--
GIVE POLICE LESS TO DO-- BY
SPENDING THE MONEY ON ADDICTION,

06:02.628 --> 06:10.670
MENTAL ILLNESS AND HOMELESSNESS.
AUSTIN CALLED IT "REIMAGINING
PUBLIC SAFETY."
>> Goff: LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

06:10.737 --> 06:16.943
GOING TO PREVENT THE VIOLENCE.
THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO IT.
AND IF WHAT YOU WANT IS LESS
VIOLENCE, YOU WANT PREVENTION.

06:17.009 --> 06:25.418
>> Pelley: WHEN PEOPLE HEAR
ABOUT REIMAGINING THE POLICE,
THAT SEEMS TO COME UNDER THE
SLOGAN OF DEFUNDING THE POLICE.

06:25.485 --> 06:30.790
AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT
THAT AND THINK, "MY COMMUNITY'S
GOING TO BE LESS SAFE."
>> Goff: I THINK THERE ARE

06:30.857 --> 06:37.130
COMMUNITIES WHERE THAT'S
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
<i>OF COURSE,</i> YOU WOULD BE.
BUT, WE'VE DEFUNDED THE SCHOOLS

06:37.196 --> 06:40.867
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.
WE'VE DEFUNDED MENTAL HEALTH.
WE'VE DEFUNDED THE ACTUAL
HOSPITALS.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.070
WE'VE DEFUNDED THE JOBS.
WE'VE DEFUNDED THE HOUSING
SYSTEM.
WE'VE DEFUNDED THE GROCERY

06:44.137 --> 06:49.976
STORES.
WHAT IF, INSTEAD OF TALKING
ABOUT<i> JUST</i> DEFUNDING POLICE,
WE TALKED ABOUT<i> RE-FUNDING</i> TO

06:50.042 --> 06:54.781
THE COMMUNITIES, THOSE<i> AREAS</i>
WHERE WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE
RESOURCES AND THE PUBLIC GOODS
AWAY?

06:54.847 --> 07:01.954
IF WE DID THAT, HOW MUCH SAFER
DO YOU THINK WE WOULD BE?
THE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE SO
ALLERGIC TO THE IDEA OF LESS

07:02.021 --> 07:07.960
POLICE IS, THEY CAN'T IMAGINE A
WORLD WHERE WE TAKE<i> BETTER</i> CARE
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
VULNERABLE.

07:08.027 --> 07:13.966
>> Pelley: BUT ARGUMENTS LIKE
THAT DIDN'T CARRY THE TEXAS
LEGISLATURE.
(<i> GAVEL</i> )

07:14.033 --> 07:22.475
REPUBLICANS PASSED A LAW
PREVENTING ANY CUTS TO POLICE
BUDGETS IN LARGE CITIES.
THE STATE GOVERNMENT AT THE

07:22.542 --> 07:26.679
CAPITOL HAS TOLD YOU, YOU CANNOT
REDUCE THE POLICE BUDGET.
>> Spencer Cronk: CORRECT.
>> Pelley: SO, AUSTIN CITY

07:26.746 --> 07:34.687
MANAGER SPENCER CRONK PUT THE
MONEY BACK IN THE POLICE BUDGET.
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR PLAN?
>> Cronk: I THINK IT DOESN'T DO

07:34.754 --> 07:41.627
MUCH, TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE THIS
PLAN HAS NEVER BEEN JUST ABOUT
RESOURCES.
THIS PLAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT,

07:41.694 --> 07:46.999
HOW DO WE THINK DIFFERENTLY
ABOUT PROVIDING PUBLIC SAFETY TO
OUR COMMUNITY?
>> Pelley: NOW, CRONK IS

07:47.066 --> 07:54.841
SPENDING THE MONEY DIFFERENTLY
<i>WITHIN</i> THE POLICE BUDGET.
HE'S UNDETERRED, PERHAPS
BECAUSE, BEFORE AUSTIN, HE RAN

07:54.907 --> 08:02.682
THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS.
HE LEFT TWO YEARS BEFORE GEORGE
FLOYD WAS MURDERED.
>> Cronk: IT IS ONE OF THOSE

08:02.748 --> 08:11.190
TIMES IN WHICH YOU KNOW THAT
THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE.
>> Pelley: CRONK STARTED THAT
CHANGE BY SHUTTING DOWN THE

08:11.257 --> 08:18.798
AUSTIN POLICE ACADEMY FOR A
YEAR, TO REWRITE THE CURRICULUM.
DO YOU FIND YOURSELF BEING TAKEN
SERIOUSLY AROUND HERE?

08:18.865 --> 08:26.305
>> Anne Kringen: YOU KNOW, I
WOULD SAY, IT VARIES?
>> Pelley: ANNE KRINGEN, WITH A
Ph.D. IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE, WAS

08:26.372 --> 08:37.149
HIRED TO OVERHAUL THE ACADEMY.
SHE WAS ONCE A COP IN VIRGINIA,
AND NOW RUNS THE JUST-REOPENED
ACADEMY, ALONGSIDE 22-YEAR

08:37.216 --> 08:42.255
VETERAN, COMMANDER CATHERINE
JOHNSON.
>> Catherine Johnson: THIS CLASS
IS THE MOST DIVERSE IN AUSTIN

08:42.321 --> 08:46.993
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S HISTORY, AND
WE WANT TO ASK THEM-- AND WE DO
ASK THEM-- IF THEY WANT TO BE A
PART OF THE CHANGE.

08:47.059 --> 08:54.500
>> Pelley: "THAT CHANGE" TONED
DOWN THE ACADEMY'S MILITARY-
STYLE BOOT-CAMP YOU CAN SEE IN
THESE PICTURES FROM 2012.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.738
>> YES, SIR!
>> YES, SIR!
>> YES, SIR!
>> Pelley: NOW, THERE'S PLENTY

08:58.804 --> 09:06.445
OF ROUGH AND TUMBLE, BUT THE
NEW CURRICULUM EMPHASIZES
DE-ESCALATION IN VIOLENT
SITUATIONS.

09:06.512 --> 09:13.953
THERE'S A COURSE ON THE HISTORY
OF RACE AND POLICING, PLUS
VISITS, IN PLAIN CLOTHES, TO
MEET AND HEAR FROM AUSTIN'S

09:14.020 --> 09:24.297
BLACK, BROWN, ASIAN, AND
L.G.B.T.Q. COMMUNITIES.
AND, THERE ARE LESSONS FROM
THOSE 9.5 MINUTES THAT DEFY

09:24.363 --> 09:30.636
EXPLANATION.
YOU'RE TRAINING THE CADETS TO
INTERVENE IF THEY BELIEVE AN
OFFICER'S DOING THE WRONG THING?

09:30.703 --> 09:34.774
>> Kringen: YES.
>> Johnson: YES.
>> Pelley: THAT'S THE MESSAGE
FROM GEORGE FLOYD?

09:34.840 --> 09:42.181
>> Kringen: I THINK IT'S ONE OF
THE MANY MESSAGES.
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO THINK OF

09:42.248 --> 09:49.121
OTHERS THAT ARE NOT POLICE
OFFICERS, WHO ARE EVERYDAY
AUSTIN CITIZENS, WHO MAY NOT
LOOK LIKE THEM-- THAT THEY CAN

09:49.188 --> 09:55.962
HUMANIZE WITH THEM.
>> Pelley: HOW DO YOU TEACH
SOMEONE TO HEAR THE WORDS, "I
CAN'T BREATHE"?

09:56.028 --> 10:05.137
>> Kringen: IT GOES BACK TO THE
TRAINING, OF THINKING, WHAT IS
THE RESISTANCE LEVEL?
THIS IS A PERSON.

10:05.204 --> 10:10.776
AND THEN I THINK WE ACTUALLY
TEACH THEM THE SKILLS AND THE
TACTICS TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "I
CAN DEAL WITH THIS.

10:10.843 --> 10:18.918
MY FOCUS HAS TO BE ON THEM.
NOT THE CROWD, BUT ON THEM."
>> Pelley: COMMANDER, YOU TALK
ABOUT EMPATHY IN ANSWERING THAT

10:18.985 --> 10:24.623
SAME QUESTION.
>> Johnson: IT'S BEING ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND AND CARE FOR THE
INDIVIDUAL IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

10:24.690 --> 10:31.964
YOU SERVE.
>> Pelley: CAN YOU TEACH THAT?
>> Johnson: YOU CAN TRY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY.

10:32.031 --> 10:41.307
>> BLACK LIVES MATTER!
>> Joseph Chacon: I THINK THAT
THERE REALLY WAS JUST A PALPABLE
ANGER AT THE POLICE THAT WAS

10:41.374 --> 10:46.679
PRESENT IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND
OTHER COMMUNITIES.
TO SOME DEGREE, THAT ANGER STILL
EXISTS.

10:46.746 --> 10:54.487
...THE CITY OF AUSTIN, SO HELP
ME GOD.
>> Pelley: JOSEPH CHACON BECAME
CHIEF LAST MONTH, AFTER HIS TWO

10:54.553 --> 11:00.393
DECADES ON THE FORCE.
ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY ASKING THE
QUESTION, "WHAT ARE THE POLICE
<i>FOR?"</i>

11:00.459 --> 11:06.699
>> Chacon: I THINK THAT<i> IS</i> THE
QUESTION.
YOU HAVE POLICE THAT HAVE BEEN
ASKED TO DO MORE AND MORE

11:06.766 --> 11:13.973
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS.
DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT SCALING
BACK ON WHAT THESE OTHER THINGS
ARE, AND SEE, IS IT MORE

11:14.040 --> 11:19.979
APPROPRIATE FOR, YOU KNOW, A
CIVILIAN OR-- OR SOMEBODY ELSE,
SOME OTHER FUNCTION, TO TAKE
CARE OF THAT?

11:20.046 --> 11:29.622
>> Pelley: CHIEF CHACON'S PLAN
IS TO SEND UNARMED CIVILIAN
EMPLOYEES TO FENDER BENDERS,
VANDALISM, OR TO TAKE REPORTS ON

11:29.688 --> 11:41.434
AUTO THEFTS AND BURGLARIES.
OF ALL THE CALLS TO 911, ONLY 1%
INVOLVE VIOLENT CRIME-- MUCH THE
SAME AS PHILIP GOFF SEES IN THE

11:41.500 --> 11:45.471
CITIES HE'S CONSULTING.
>> Goff: AND THE ADAGE HAS
BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT
SINCE FOREVER, 80% OF

11:45.538 --> 11:50.776
WHAT WE DO HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH-- WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.
IT'S ALL SOCIAL WORK.
SO, ONCE THE 911 CALLS SAY,

11:50.843 --> 11:58.717
"HERE'S WHAT THE USES OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT ARE," YOU CAN SAY,
"HEY, THIS STUFF, THE KITTEN-UP-
THE-TREE STUFF, DO YOU<i> NEED</i> A

11:58.784 --> 12:04.190
BADGE AND A GUN FOR THAT?
THE SUBSTANCE-USE STUFF.
YOU WANT A SOCIAL WORKER TO GO
THERE, SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY

12:04.256 --> 12:09.195
TRAINED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE?
MENTAL HEALTH STUFF.
HOW ABOUT WE SEND SOMEONE WHO'S
TRAINED IN THAT, TO GO DO THAT?"

12:09.261 --> 12:13.566
AND WE'RE STARTING TO CUT AWAY
AT THE THINGS WE'VE ASKED LAW
ENFORCEMENT TO DO, THAT THEY
DON'T WANT TO DO.

12:13.632 --> 12:21.273
>> AUSTIN 911, WHAT'S YOUR
EMERGENCY?
>> Pelley: AMONG THOSE THINGS
ARE MENTAL HEALTH CALLS.

12:21.340 --> 12:26.078
>> DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS OF
SUICIDE OR SELF-HARM?
>> Pelley: AND THIS IS WHERE
AUSTIN IS A CITY LEADING THE

12:26.145 --> 12:30.683
NATION.
>> Ken Murphy: SO NOW IN THE
CITY OF AUSTIN, WHEN YOU CALL
911, YOU WILL HEAR, "DO YOU

12:30.749 --> 12:37.957
NEED POLICE, FIRE, E.M.S., OR
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES?"
>> Pelley: POLICE LIEUTENANT KEN
MURPHY MANAGES 911.

12:38.023 --> 12:45.764
>> Murphy: I DO BELIEVE ADDING
THE FOURTH OPTION TO MENTAL
HEALTH IS THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF
911.

12:45.831 --> 12:52.872
>> Pelley: IN AUSTIN, 911'S
"FOURTH OPTION" DISPATCHES
MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS WHEN
INTERVENTION IS NEEDED, BUT

12:52.938 --> 13:02.214
THERE'S NO APPARENT THREAT OF
VIOLENCE.
>> Pelley: IN 2021, THIS WAS THE
RESULT.

13:02.281 --> 13:10.689
>> Murphy: WE WERE ABLE TO
DIVERT 3,564 CALLS AWAY FROM
POLICE RESPONSE.
>> Pelley: SO, THOSE WERE 3,600

13:10.756 --> 13:14.793
CALLS THE POLICE NEVER GOT--
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RESPOND--
>> Murphy: CORRECT.
>> Pelley: WHICH LEFT THEM TO DO

13:14.860 --> 13:22.768
WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEEDED TO DO.
>> Murphy: RESPOND TO EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS.
>> Pelley: THAT WORK-LOAD OFF

13:22.835 --> 13:31.977
COPS COMES AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.
LIKE MANY CITIES, CHIEF JOSEPH
CHACON'S DEPARTMENT IS SUFFERING
A QUIET CRISIS.

13:32.044 --> 13:38.684
POLICE OFFICERS I'VE TALKED TO
HAVE TOLD ME, SINCE GEORGE
FLOYD, THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE
THEY ARE RESPECTED.

13:38.751 --> 13:43.956
COPS ARE RETIRING ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
>> Chacon: YEAH, THEY'RE
RETIRING HERE AS WELL.

13:44.023 --> 13:53.666
MY ATTRITION RATE IS ABOUT
TRIPLE WHAT IT WAS FOUR YEARS
AGO.
BUT WHAT I TELL OUR OFFICERS IS

13:53.732 --> 13:58.070
THAT, I KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF THIS DEPARTMENT.
I KNOW THEIR HEARTS.
AND WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE AND

13:58.137 --> 14:05.844
THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB, THEY
NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THAT, AND
NOT ON ANY FALSE NARRATIVE THERE
MIGHT BE ABOUT HOW POLICING IS

14:05.911 --> 14:10.683
JUST ABSOLUTELY BROKEN.
CAN WE DO THINGS BETTER?
CERTAINLY.
BUT THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT I

14:10.749 --> 14:18.691
THINK THAT WE DO VERY WELL.
>> Pelley: THE PERIOD AFTER
GEORGE FLOYD HAS BEEN DEADLY FOR
OFFICERS, TOO.

14:18.757 --> 14:26.665
THE F.B.I. REPORTS, THIS YEAR,
66 HAVE BEEN MURDERED, A 53%
JUMP FROM 2020.
THE LEADING CAUSE OF THESE

14:26.732 --> 14:37.710
DEATHS HAS BEEN UNPROVOKED
ATTACKS.
AUSTIN, AND CITIES ADVISED BY
PHILIP GOFF, ARE ASKING WHETHER

14:37.776 --> 14:46.685
JUSTICE AND SAFETY CAN BE FOUND
IN RELIEVING POVERTY, ADDICTION,
AND MENTAL ILLNESS, WHILE
FOCUSING POLICE ON THOSE "THINGS

14:46.752 --> 14:55.961
THEY DO VERY WELL."
>> Goff: THEY COULD BE THE MODEL
FOR HOW WE START OVER AT KEEPING
THE VULNERABLE FOLKS IN OUR

14:56.028 --> 15:01.900
COMMUNITIES SAFE.
THEY COULD SAY, "WE'RE GOING
TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN
WE'VE EVER DONE THIS IN THE

15:01.967 --> 15:07.973
UNITED STATES BEFORE."
THEY COULD BE WHO WE TELL
OURSELVES WE ALREADY ARE, ABOUT
RACIAL JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY.

15:08.040 --> 15:21.920
THAT'S-- THAT'S THE PROMISE.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Whitaker: IF YOU ARE
PLANNING TO TRAVEL BY AIR OVER

15:21.987 --> 15:29.328
THE THANKSGIVING OR CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAYS-- AND MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS ARE-- WOULD YOU JUMP
AT THE CHANCE TO GET TO YOUR

15:29.395 --> 15:34.733
DESTINATION IN HALF THE TIME?
DOES NEW YORK TO LOS ANGELES IN
UNDER THREE HOURS SOUND
APPEALING?

15:34.800 --> 15:42.041
THE LAST COMMERCIAL SUPERSONIC
FLIGHT WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO,
AND EVEN THEN, SUPER-FAST
FLIGHTS WERE ONLY ON VERY

15:42.107 --> 15:50.316
LIMITED ROUTES.
MOST OF TODAY'S JETLINERS
ACTUALLY FLY MORE SLOWLY THAN
THEY DID 20 OR 30 YEARS AGO,

15:50.382 --> 15:58.524
IN ORDER TO SAVE FUEL.
BUT THAT MAY BE ABOUT TO CHANGE.
IT'S STILL A LONG SHOT, BUT

OCTOBER 24, 2003, EVERYONE ON

16:17.843 --> 16:24.016
BOARD-- PASSENGERS AND PILOTS--
KNEW THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL WAS
COMING TO AN END.
>> Pilot: ENJOY THE MOMENT, AS

16:24.083 --> 16:30.022
YOU ARE THE LAST PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD, AS PASSENGERS, TO CRUISE
AT TWICE THE SPEED OF SOUND.
>> Whitaker: THE SUPERSONIC

16:30.089 --> 16:38.030
CONCORDE, A JOINT EFFORT OF THE
BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS,
WAS MAKING ITS LAST FLIGHT AFTER
NEARLY 30 YEARS IN THE AIR,

16:38.097 --> 16:44.636
GROUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF
STRATOSPHERIC COSTS, AND
SFETY CONCERNS AFTER A DEADLY
CRASH IN 2000.

16:44.703 --> 16:49.808
EVEN PEOPLE WATCHING THAT
LAST LANDING IN LONDON WERE
EMOTIONAL.

IT'S-- IT'S BACK TO STAY.
>> Whitaker: BLAKE SCHOLL IS THE

FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF BOOM.
HIS AUDACIOUS GOAL IS TO BUILD A
NEW SUPERSONIC AIRLINER FROM

A SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT, ANYWHERE?
>> Scholl: NO.
NO, NOWHERE.

MILITARIES ONLY.
>> Whitaker: BOOM IS NOT THE
ONLY AMERICAN START-UP COMPANY

17:24.109 --> 17:30.115

SWEEPSTAKES.
SPIKE IS DEVELOPING AN
ULTRA-FAST BUSINESS JET, AND

17:30.182 --> 17:38.724
HERMEUS ASPIRES TO MAKE A
HYPERSONIC PLANE THAT WOULD FLY
FIVE TIMES THE SPEED OF SOUND.
BUT BOOM IS THE ONLY ENTRANT TO

17:38.791 --> 17:45.597
ACTUALLY BUILD AN AIRPLANE.
THIS IS IT?
>> Scholl: THAT'S IT.
>> Whitaker: OH, WOW.

17:45.664 --> 17:52.604
SO FAR, BLAKE SCHOLL AND BOOM
HAVE BUILT THIS SINGLE-SEATER
TEST PLANE, DUE TO MAKE ITS
FIRST FLIGHT NEXT YEAR.

17:52.671 --> 18:00.045
THE PASSENGER JET MEANT TO
FOLLOW IS CALLED OVERTURE.
IT ONLY EXISTS IN ARTIST
RENDERINGS, BUT IT'S REAL ENOUGH

18:00.112 --> 18:06.385
FOR ONE OF AMERICA'S LARGEST
AIRLINES TO CLIMB ON BOARD.
SO, IS THE OVERTURE THE PLANE
THAT UNITED RECENTLY ORDERED?

18:06.452 --> 18:14.226
>> Scholl: THAT'S RIGHT.
UNITED JUST ORDERED 15 OVERTURE
AIRPLANES.
SO, MORE OVERTURES THAN

18:14.293 --> 18:18.831
CONCORDES WERE EVER DELIVERED
INTO SERVICE.
>> Whitaker: IS THIS UNITED DEAL
LIKE A-- A STAMP OF APPROVAL?

18:18.897 --> 18:24.036
>> Scholl: I THINK IT'S
INCREDIBLY VALIDATING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE UNITED,
YOU TAKE-- YOU TAKE THESE THINGS

18:24.102 --> 18:30.609
REALLY SERIOUSLY.

DO YOU THINK HE CAN?
>> Ostrower: I THINK YOU CANNOT
IGNORE THE OBSTACLES THAT WILL

20:02.901 --> 20:12.044

THAT IS-- IS REQUIRED TO MAKE

20:12.110 --> 20:18.050

IT TAKE?
>> Ostrower: PROBABLY IN THE

$20 BILLION.
>> Whitaker: OSTROWER SAYS
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT COST BOEING

20:24.122 --> 20:33.332

A NEW SUB-SONIC AIRLINER, AND
THEY ALREADY HAVE HUGE
MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.

20:33.398 --> 20:41.607
BOOM DOESN'T.
BLAKE SCHOLL TOLD US HE CAN GET
OVERTURE BUILT FOR $7 TO $8
BILLION, BUT THAT'S A LOT MORE

20:41.673 --> 20:48.046
THAN THE $300 MILLION HE'S
RAISED SO FAR.
AND MONEY'S NOT THE ONLY HURDLE.
BOOM AND UNITED HAVE PROMISED

21:21.413 --> 21:26.718

LIGHTLY CUSTOMIZED ENGINE.
AND PART OF THAT IS ROLLS
ROYCE'S WORK, WHERE THEY'RE KIND

21:26.785 --> 21:33.825
OF TURNING SOME DESIGN KNOBS.
>> Whitaker: BLAKE SCHOLL
DOESN'T DISMISS THE SKEPTICS,
BUT HE POINTS TO THE EXAMPLE

21:33.892 --> 21:40.165
OF ELON MUSK, AND SAYS NOT SO
LONG AGO, NO ONE THOUGHT HE
COULD BUILD TESLAS AND REUSABLE
ROCKETS.

21:40.232 --> 21:44.670
WHERE DOES THIS PASSION COME
FROM?
>> Scholl: IT'S BECAUSE WE
STOPPED MAKING PROGRESS ON THE

21:44.736 --> 21:49.708
SPEED OF TRAVEL.
YOU KNOW, THE AIRPLANES WE HAVE
TODAY ARE NO FASTER THAN THE
ONES WE HAD WHEN MY PARENTS WERE

21:49.775 --> 21:54.046
GROWING UP.
AND THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR
THAT.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

21:54.112 --> 22:00.052
WE CAN FIX IT.
>> Whitaker: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT
THE FIRST PAYING CUSTOMERS TO
FLY ON ONE OF YOUR PLANES?

22:00.118 --> 22:06.058
>> Scholl: BY THE END OF THE
DECADE.
>> Whitaker: SUPERSONIC REALLY
ONLY MAKES SENSE ON FLIGHTS OF

22:06.124 --> 22:13.331
FOUR OR FIVE HOURS, OR MORE.
BUT THOUSANDS OF SUCH ROUTES ARE
OUT OF REACH TO BOOM.
THE REASON IS IN THE VERY NAME

22:13.398 --> 22:20.472
OF HIS COMPANY.
(<i> SONIC BOOM</i> )
THAT'S THE SOUND OF A SONIC BOOM
CREATED BY A PLANE BREAKING THE

22:20.539 --> 22:26.712
SOUND BARRIER.
LISTEN AGAIN:
(<i> SONIC BOOM</i> )
THE FIRST BOOM WAS MADE BY CHUCK

22:26.778 --> 22:34.720
YEAGER'S X-1 ROCKET PLANE WHEN
IT PASSED THROUGH MACH ONE--
ABOUT 660 MILES PER HOUR--
BACK IN 1947.

22:34.786 --> 22:41.526
>> Announcer: AND HE DOES IT.
(<i> SONIC BOOM</i> )
>> Whitaker: WHAT IS THE SONIC
BOOM?

22:41.593 --> 22:46.732
WHAT-- WHAT GENERATES IT?
>> Mike Buonanno: SO, WHEN AN
AIRCRAFT FLIES FASTER THAN THE
SPEED OF SOUND, IT CREATES

22:46.798 --> 22:54.039
DISTURBANCES.
>> Whitaker: MIKE BUONANNO IS A
TOP ENGINEER AT LOCKHEED
MARTIN'S "SKUNKWORKS" AIRCRAFT

22:54.106 --> 22:59.277
DESIGN STUDIO IN CALIFORNIA.
DAVE RICHARDSON IS HIS BOSS.
>> Dave Richardson: A LOT OF US
UNDERSTAND THE WAKE THAT'S

22:59.344 --> 23:05.817
GENERATED BY A SHIP OR A BOAT.
AND SO, IMAGINE THAT WAKE FROM A
SPEED BOAT OR WHATEVER, ALL
THOSE DIFFERENT WAVES COMING TO

23:05.884 --> 23:10.722
BE ONE LARGE WAVE.
>> Buonanno: THOSE INDIVIDUAL
DISTURBANCES CREATED UP BY THE
AIRPLANE, THEY COMBINE TOGETHER

23:10.789 --> 23:18.063
TO MAKE A LOUD DOUBLE BANG.
>> Whitaker: THE FEDERAL
AVIATION ADMINISTRATION TESTED
THE IMPACT OF THAT BIG BANG BACK

23:18.130 --> 23:26.738
IN 1964, BY FLYING MILITARY
SUPERSONIC JETS LIKE THESE OVER
OKLAHOMA CITY FOR SIX MONTHS.
THE OUTCOME?

23:26.805 --> 23:33.912
BROKEN BRICKS AND CEILINGS,
FRAYED NERVES AND PUBLIC
OUTRAGE.
>> Buonanno: IT WAS JUST

23:33.979 --> 23:39.251
PATENTLY OBVIOUS THAT NO ONE WAS
GOING TO TOLERATE SUCH A LOUD
NOISE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.
>> Whitaker: THE RESULT WAS A

23:39.317 --> 23:46.691
BAN ON CIVILIAN SUPERSONIC
FLIGHTS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD,
OTHER THAN OVER OPEN WATER.
>> Buonanno: AND THAT BASICALLY

23:46.758 --> 23:54.032
HIT THE BRAKES ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIAL
AIR TRAVEL, IN TERMS OF AN
ADVANCING SPEED.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.737
UP UNTIL THAT BAN, EVERY DECADE,
AIR TRAVEL HAD GOTTEN FASTER AND
FASTER.
>> Whitaker: THE BAN REMAINS IN

23:58.804 --> 24:06.344
PLACE TODAY.
SO, IF BOOM GETS ITS OVERTURE IN
THE AIR, IT WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO
SERVE LONG TRANS-OCEANIC ROUTES,

24:06.411 --> 24:11.316
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CONCORDE
FLEW.
>> Buonanno: SO IF YOU WANT TO
GO FROM J.F.K. IN NEW YORK TO

24:11.383 --> 24:18.590
PARIS, THAT'S OKAY.
BUT FOR MANY OF US, WE WANT TO
FLY PLACES OVER LAND.
HERE LIVING IN LOS ANGELES,

24:18.657 --> 24:24.062
ALMOST EVERYWHERE I WANT TO GO--
FLYING EAST, REQUIRES OVER-LAND
TRAVEL.
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

24:24.129 --> 24:29.067
BIG PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE
TRYING TO SOLVE.
>> Whitaker: BUONANNO AND
RICHARDSON AND THEIR LOCKHEED

24:29.134 --> 24:36.041
MARTIN TEAM HAVE BEEN
COMMISSIONED BY NASA TO BUILD A
TEST PLANE THAT CAN FLY TWICE AS
FAST AS CURRENT AIRLINERS,

24:36.107 --> 24:42.714
WITHOUT RATTLING NERVES OR
BREAKING WINDOWS.
YOUR MISSION IS TO GET RID OF
THIS SONIC BOOM?

24:42.781 --> 24:50.755
>> Buonanno: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE AIRPLANE
IS TO REDUCE SONIC BOOM.
>> Whitaker: THE AIRPLANE IS

24:50.822 --> 24:57.329
CALLED THE X-59.
IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS, WHEN
IT MAKES ITS FIRST FLIGHT NEXT
YEAR.

24:57.395 --> 25:02.734
FOR NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS,
INSIDE LOCKHEED MARTIN'S
ASSEMBLY BUILDING.
>> Richardson: YOU'RE LOOKING AT

25:02.801 --> 25:09.875
THE COCKPIT OF THE AIRPLANE, AND
THERE'S NO FORWARD WINDSCREEN.
THIS IS IT.
>> Whitaker: EVERY PART OF THE

25:09.941 --> 25:18.049
X-59 IS STREAMLINED AND SMOOTH,
TO DISPERSE SOUND WAVES AND
TRANSFORM THE LOUD SONIC BOOM
INTO A MUCH QUIETER "THUMP."

25:18.116 --> 25:24.055
>> Nils Larson: IF YOU LOOK AT
IT, IT'S PRETTY SLICK.
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE A DART.
>> Whitaker: NILS LARSON IS THE

25:24.122 --> 25:33.531
NASA TEST PILOT WHOSE JOB IT
WILL BE TO PROVE THAT THE X-59
CAN REPLACE THE SONIC BOOM WITH
A SIMPLE THUMP.

25:33.598 --> 25:40.872
STARTING NEXT YEAR, HE'LL PILOT
SOME OF THE EARLY TEST FLIGHTS,
AND THEN ITS FIRST SOUND TESTS.
>> Larson: THAT'S COMING TO A

25:40.939 --> 25:46.878
TOWN NEAR YOU.
SO, OUR RESEARCHERS ARE GOING
TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC, AND
WE'RE GOING TO FLY OVER VARIOUS

25:46.945 --> 25:54.052
CITIES AND TOWNS, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO GIVE US THE FEEDBACK
OF THAT THUMP.
WAS THAT THUMP TOO LOUD?

25:54.119 --> 26:00.058
YOU KNOW, DID YOU EVEN HEAR IT
AT ALL?
>> Whitaker: SO, IF YOU ARE ABLE
TO FLY OVER POPULATED AREAS, AND

26:00.125 --> 26:06.731
PROVIDE THIS DATA, THEN THE
F.A.A. WILL USE THIS DATA,
PERHAPS, TO LIFT THIS BAN?
>> Larson: EXACTLY.

26:06.798 --> 26:14.739
>> Whitaker: ARE WE LIKELY TO
SEE PLANES IN THE FUTURE FLYING
SUPERSONIC THAT LOOK LIKE THIS
ONE?

26:14.806 --> 26:21.012
>> Larson: I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
AND I THINK YOU WILL.
SO, THERE ARE DEFINITE THINGS
THAT YOU WOULD SEE, IF YOU

26:21.079 --> 26:26.718
WALKED INTO A COMMERCIAL, YOU
KNOW, SUPERSONIC AIRPLANE HERE,
YOU KNOW, TEN, 12 YEARS FROM
NOW, AND YOU WERE TO LOOK AT

26:26.785 --> 26:34.726
THAT, YOU COULD SEE, YOU KNOW,
SOME D.N.A. THAT GOES BACK TO
THE X-59.
>> Whitaker: LARSON TOOK US OVER

26:34.793 --> 26:42.233
TO NASA'S X-59 FLIGHT SIMULATOR,
AND THE FIRST THING WE NOTICED
IS THAT THERE'S A TV SCREEN IN
PLACE OF THE MISSING WINDSHIELD.

26:42.300 --> 26:48.039
FOR YOU, DOES IT WORK AS WELL AS
USING YOUR OWN EYES?
>> Larson: YEAH, I THINK--
SO FAR, I THINK IT DOES.

26:48.106 --> 26:52.077
ABOUT TO GO THROUGH MACH ONE.
THERE'S MACH ONE.
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE--
>> Whitaker: SO WE'RE NOW GOING

26:52.143 --> 26:56.381
SUPERSONIC.
>> Larson: YUP, YOU'RE NOW
SUPERSONIC.
>> Whitaker: LARSON GAVE ME A

26:56.448 --> 27:05.290
TURN IN THE COCKPIT-- NOT TO
FLY<i> SUPERSONIC,</i> BUT TO LAND THE
X-59-- WHICH IS TRICKY, GIVEN
THAT IT'S SHAPED LIKE A PENCIL,

27:05.357 --> 27:09.961
HAS NO WINDSHIELD, AND I'M NOT A
PILOT.
>> Larson: COME UP, FOLLOW THEM
UP JUST A LITTLE BIT.

27:10.028 --> 27:16.101
SO, PULL BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT,
LITTLE BIT MORE.
AND JUST HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

27:16.167 --> 27:19.938
THERE YOU GO.
YOU JUST LANDED THE X-59.
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RUNWAY!
>> Whitaker: I LANDED-- I LANDED

27:20.005 --> 27:22.741
THE--
>> Larson: THAT'S BETTER THAN I
DID.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

27:22.807 --> 27:30.048
SIGN HIM UP!
>> Whitaker: NILS LARSON WILL
START TEST-FLYING THE REAL X-59
SOMETIME NEXT YEAR.

27:30.115 --> 27:38.723
AND SOON AFTER THAT, HE'LL BE
FLYING IT OVER US.
AND IF IT'S QUIET ENOUGH, FUTURE
PLANES THAT FOLLOW ITS DESIGN

27:38.790 --> 27:46.731
LEAD COULD EVENTUALLY FLY US
LOTS OF PLACES, TWICE AS FAST AS
WE CAN GET THERE NOW.
WHEN MIGHT I BE ABLE TO FLY FROM

27:46.798 --> 27:51.136
NEW YORK TO LOS ANGELES IN A
SUPERSONIC PLANE?
>> Richardson: SO THERE'S--
THERE'S A LONG LINE OF THINGS

27:51.202 --> 27:57.776
THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN, STARTING
WITH THE X-59.
BUT I THINK 2035 IS YOUR ANSWER,
IF EVERYTHING MARCHES ALONG THE

27:57.842 --> 28:02.814
WAY THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO.
>> Whitaker: IT'S SOMETHING THAT
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE
FOR-- FOR DECADES.

28:02.881 --> 28:09.554
HAVE YOU GUYS SOLVED THAT
PROBLEM?
>> Buonanno: WE BELIEVE WE HAVE.
IT'S REWARDING SEEING IT GETTING

28:09.621 --> 28:15.093
BUILT.
BUT I THINK THAT REAL "AHA"
MOMENT FOR ME IS GOING TO BE
WHEN I HEAR THAT FIRST SHAPED

28:15.160 --> 28:20.231
BOOM FROM X-59.
>> Whitaker: THUMP, THUMP.
>> Buonanno: THUMP, THUMP.
>> Richardson: WE WON'T HEAR

28:20.298 --> 28:26.738
THIS<i> BANG.</i>
AND WHEN WE HEAR, OR<i> DON'T</i> HEAR,
THAT SOUND, IS WHEN WE KNOW WE
DID IT.

>> Cooper: SO, WHERE DID ALL
THESE IDEAS COME FROM?
>> Wallace-Hadrill: WELL,

30:39.837 --> 30:47.879
LARGELY FROM ROBERT GRAVES.
YOU KNOW, HIS "I, CLAUDIUS"
NOVELS ARE AWESOME.
BUT HE WASN'T AN ACADEMIC.

30:47.946 --> 30:53.952
HE WAS A WRITER.
>> Cooper: ANDREW WALLACE-
HADRILL<i> IS</i> AN ACADEMIC-- A
PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT THE

30:54.018 --> 30:59.390
UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, AND
HE'S CLOSELY STUDIED THE FEW
WRITTEN ACCOUNTS THAT SURVIVE
FROM CALIGULA'S TIME.

30:59.457 --> 31:03.928
I GREW UP WATCHING "I,
CLAUDIUS."
I LOVED THE BOOK.
I LOVE THE OLD TV SERIES.

31:03.995 --> 31:09.667
YOU'RE TELLING ME, A LOT OF THAT
JUST WASN'T TRUE.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: NOW, WHAT
I'M NOT DENYING IS THEY HAD SEX

31:09.734 --> 31:15.773
IN THE PALACE.
OF COURSE THEY HAD SEX.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
PRETTY SPECTACULARLY, OF COURSE

31:15.840 --> 31:19.510
THEY HAD SEX.
>> Cooper: (<i> LAUGHS</i> )
PRETTY SPECTACULARLY?
>> Cooper: BUT WALLACE-HADRILL

31:19.577 --> 31:24.749
DOES BELIEVE CALIGULA COULD BE
VERY IMPULSIVE AND BRUTAL, AND
HE DOESN'T RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD

31:24.816 --> 31:30.755
A SEVERE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
DISORDER.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: I THINK
THERE'S A SERIOUS DANGER THAT

31:30.822 --> 31:39.397
CALIGULA WAS-- WAS PATHOLOGICAL,
THAT HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THE HURT HE CAUSED.
>> Cooper: WALLACE-HADRILL SAYS

31:39.464 --> 31:47.405
ROBERT GRAVES' NOVELS WERE
LARGELY BASED ON STORIES
PUBLISHED AROUND 121 A.D.,
80 YEARS AFTER CALIGULA'S DEATH,

31:47.472 --> 31:54.045
BY SUETONIUS, A WELL-KNOWN
BIOGRAPHER AND ADVISER TO LATER
EMPERORS.
BUT SUETONIUS OFTEN HAD TO RELY

31:54.112 --> 31:59.284
ON SECOND-HAND STORIES AND
GOSSIP FROM MEMBERS OF THE
IMPERIAL COURT.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: THESE

31:59.350 --> 32:05.356
MEMBERS OF THE COURT, IT'S--
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE STAFFERS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
IT'S LIKE ALL THOSE LEAKY PEOPLE

32:05.423 --> 32:10.828
IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
WHAT ARE THESE STORIES WORTH?
HOW CAN YOU PIN THEM DOWN?
(<i> CHURCH BELLS</i> )

32:10.895 --> 32:18.169
>> Cooper: ARCHEOLOGY CAN
HELP PIN DOWN THE PAST, BUT IN A
CITY FULL OF AMAZING RUINS, NOT
MUCH DIRECTLY LINKED TO CALIGULA

32:18.236 --> 32:23.808
HAD BEEN DISCOVERED--
THAT IS, UNTIL 2006.
(<i> CONSTRUCTION</i> )
WHEN A PENSION FUND FOR ITALIAN

32:23.875 --> 32:30.748
DOCTORS CALLED ENPAM STARTED
DIGGING AN UNDERGROUND PARKING
GARAGE FOR ITS NEW OFFICE
BUILDING IN THE ESQUILINO

32:30.815 --> 32:38.356
NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME.
IN ANCIENT TIMES, THIS WAS ONE
OF A NUMBER OF TRANQUIL GARDEN
ESTATES LOCATED ABOUT TEN

32:38.423 --> 32:45.797
MINUTES BY CARRIAGE FROM THE
BUSTLING ROMAN FORUM.
THESE RE-CREATIONS FROM ROME'S
SUPERINTENDENT OF ANTIQUITIES

32:45.863 --> 32:53.871
GIVE SOME SENSE OF THE SPRAWLING
GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS ENJOYED BY
EMPERORS AND THEIR GUESTS FOR
ABOUT FOUR CENTURIES.

32:53.938 --> 32:59.544
IT TOOK ARCHEOLOGISTS NINE YEARS
TO CAREFULLY RECOVER MORE THAN A
MILLION PIECES OF THE PAST,
WHILE AN UNDERGROUND PARKING

32:59.610 --> 33:05.650
GARAGE AND MODERN BUILDING WAS
BUILT AROUND THEM.
(<i> EXCAVATION</i> )
EVERYTHING FOUND WAS TAKEN TO A

33:05.717 --> 33:12.757
LARGE WAREHOUSE, WHERE IT WAS
CLOSELY ANALYZED, LOGGED INTO A
DATABASE, AND-- WHEN POSSIBLE--
PAINSTAKINGLY RESTORED.

33:12.824 --> 33:19.497
THE OFFICE BUILDING'S COMPLETED
NOW, AND LAST MONTH, ROME'S
NEWEST ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE, THE
NYMPHEUM MUSEUM, OPENED IN THE

33:19.564 --> 33:27.438
BASEMENT, PRESERVING SOME OF THE
EXCAVATION, AND SUGGESTING WHAT
A LUSH AND LAVISH PLACE THIS
ONCE WAS.

33:27.505 --> 33:35.413
IT CONTAINS THOUSANDS OF ITEMS,
FROM THE SECOND CENTURY B.C.
THROUGH THE FIFTH CENTURY A.D.,
LIKE THIS DRINKING GLASS THAT

33:35.480 --> 33:42.754
SOMEHOW SURVIVED LARGELY INTACT
FOR 1,900 YEARS.
MIRELLA SERLORENZI, DIRECTOR OF
EXCAVATIONS FOR THE ITALIAN

33:42.820 --> 33:48.726
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, TOOK US TO
A SMALL STAIRCASE NORMALLY
CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, AND
BROUGHT US TO THE LEVEL OF THE

33:48.793 --> 33:57.468
GROUND DURING CALIGULA'S TIME.
AND SO, BACK THEN, IN THE FIRST
CENTURY, 2,000 YEARS AGO, THIS
WAS OUTSIDE?

33:57.535 --> 34:03.541
>> Mirella Serlorenzi
(<i> translated</i> ): IT WAS CLEARLY
A GARDEN, BECAUSE WE FOUND IN
THE LAYERS TRACES OF THE ROOTS

34:03.608 --> 34:10.648
OF THE PLANTS, AND IN THIS
PART HERE, THE STAIRCASE
CONNECTED THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF
THE GARDEN.

34:10.715 --> 34:15.386
>> Cooper: IS IT POSSIBLE TO
WALK ON IT?
>> Serlorenzi:<i> ASSOLUTAMENTE.</i>
>> Cooper: YEAH?

34:15.453 --> 34:23.394
EXCELLENT.
THIS IS WHAT SERLORENZI'S TEAM
BELIEVES THE AREA LOOKED LIKE
DURING CALIGULA'S REIGN.

34:23.461 --> 34:29.867
WE ENDED UP TALKING FOR A LONG
TIME ON THE GARDEN STEPS.
ISIT ALL RIGHT TO SIT DOWN?
>> Serlorenzi: SIT, OKAY.

34:29.934 --> 34:35.406
>> Cooper: THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT TOUCHING THOSE OLD SLABS
OF MARBLE THAT MADE ANCIENT
HISTORY FEEL VERY REAL.

34:35.473 --> 34:42.480
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE
SITTING ON THE STEPS THAT
CALIGULA MAY HAVE WALKED ON.
IT'S AMAZING.

34:42.547 --> 34:47.485
SHE TOLD US THE WATER PIPE BY
OUR FEET WAS INSTALLED BY
CALIGULA'S SUCCESSOR, HIS UNCLE
CLAUDIUS.

34:47.552 --> 34:54.826
HIS NAME IS STAMPED ON THE PIPE.
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE
THINGS ABOUT CALIGULA IS THAT HE
LIVED TO BECOME EMPEROR AT ALL.

34:54.892 --> 35:00.731
THE EMPEROR BEFORE HIM, HIS
ADOPTIVE GRANDFATHER TIBERIUS,
WAS SUSPECTED OF KILLING
CALIGULA'S FATHER, MOTHER, AND

35:00.798 --> 35:07.505
TWO BROTHERS.
AND WHEN CALIGULA TURNED 19,
HE WAS SUMMONED TO LIVE WITH
TIBERIUS AT HIS PALACE ON THE

35:07.572 --> 35:15.379
ISLAND OF CAPRI.
IT SITS HIGH ON A CLIFF, AND
IT'S SAID TIBERIUS WOULD HAVE
PEOPLE WHO CROSSED HIM TOSSED

35:15.446 --> 35:22.320
ONTO THE ROCKS BELOW.
THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF
FLATTERY AND DECEIT, CALIGULA
MANAGED TO SURVIVE HERE FOR

35:22.386 --> 35:30.228
SIX YEARS WITH THE MAN WHO MAY
HAVE KILLED MUCH OF HIS FAMILY.
HE BECAME TIBERIUS'S SUCCESSOR
IN 37 A.D.

35:30.294 --> 35:35.700
HE WAS JUST 24 YEARS OLD, AND IN
CHARGE OF AN EMPIRE.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: HE WAS IN A
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT POSITION.

35:35.766 --> 35:46.911
I LIKE THE SAYING OF TIBERIUS,
WHO SAYS, "BEING EMPEROR IS
LIKE HAVING TO HOLD A WOLF BY
THE EARS."

35:46.978 --> 35:51.782
THERE'S THIS SORT OF SAVAGE
BEAST, THAT CAN TURN ON YOU ANY
MOMENT.
>> Cooper: WHAT IS SO INSECURE

35:51.849 --> 35:59.257
ABOUT IT?
WAS IT THE SYSTEM ITSELF?
>> Wallace-Hadrill: YOU'VE GOT
THIS ENORMOUS CONCENTRATION OF

35:59.323 --> 36:06.697
POWER AND RESOURCE, WEALTH,
CONCENTRATED ON THE PALACE IN
ROME.
AND EVERYONE WANTS IN ON IT.

36:06.764 --> 36:11.802
AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO DO
ANYTHING TO SEIZE THIS POWER.
>> Cooper: BACK THEN, THE ROMAN
EMPIRE DOMINATED THE

36:11.869 --> 36:19.143
MEDITERRANEAN WORLD.
AND ITEMS FOUND IN THE GARDENS
GIVE SOME SENSE OF THE RICHES
THAT FLOWED TOWARDS ROME.

36:19.210 --> 36:24.749
RARE AND INTRICATELY-CARVED
MARBLE FROM THE FAR REACHES OF
THE EMPIRE DECORATED THE WALLS
OF THE BUILDINGS.

36:24.815 --> 36:30.221
GLASS RECOVERED AT THE SITE
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN USED IN
VERY EARLY WINDOWS.
AND, LARGE AMOUNTS OF OYSTERS

36:30.288 --> 36:35.393
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SERVED AT
MEALS.
MIRELLA SERLORENZI SAYS HER
TEAM RECOVERED THE BONES OF

36:35.459 --> 36:41.165
WILD ANIMALS THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE FROM
FAR-AWAY LANDS.
SHE SHOWED US THE LEG OF AN

36:41.232 --> 36:47.038
OSTRICH, THE FOOT OF A LION, AND
THE TOOTH OF A BEAR.
>> Serlorenzi (<i> translated</i> ):
IT'S EVIDENT THAT WILD ANIMALS

36:47.104 --> 36:54.211
WERE HERE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT
OF THE EMPEROR.
GAMES WERE CARRIED OUT HERE WITH
GLADIATORS, WE CAN IMAGINE, AND

36:54.278 --> 36:59.784
BATTLES WITH FEROCIOUS BEASTS.
>> Cooper: WHEN HE BECAME
EMPEROR, CALIGULA STARTED
IMPROVING ROME'S INFRASTRUCTURE.

36:59.850 --> 37:07.491
HE BEGAN WORK ON NEW AQUEDUCTS.
HE ALSO CUT TAXES.
SERLORENZI SAYS THIS COIN FOUND
IN THE GARDENS WAS MINTED AROUND

37:07.558 --> 37:15.399
39 A.D. TO REMIND ROMANS THAT
CALIGULA GOT RID OF A SALES TAX.
2,000 YEARS AGO, POLITICIANS
WERE JUST LIKE POLITICIANS

37:15.466 --> 37:21.939
TODAY?
IF THEY CUT TAXES, THEY WANTED
EVERYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
>> Serlorenzi (<i> translated</i> ):

37:22.006 --> 37:27.445
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THE COINS ARE A FORM OF IMPERIAL
PROPAGANDA.
>> Cooper: BUT SOMETHING CHANGED

37:27.511 --> 37:35.386
AS THE YEARS PROGRESSED.
SUETONIUS SAYS CALIGULA WANTED
TO BE TREATED AS A GOD, AND
CONNECTED HIS PALACE IN THE

37:35.453 --> 37:39.190
ROMAN FORUM TO A MAJOR TEMPLE.
THAT'S THE TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND
POLLUX?
>> Paolo Carafa: EXACTLY,

37:39.256 --> 37:43.494
EXACTLY, AND THIS COLUMN HAS
BEEN STANDING THERE FOR MORE
THAN 2,000 YEARS.
>> Cooper: THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

37:43.561 --> 37:47.898
>> Carafa: THEY HAVE BEEN
CREATED IN THE YEAR SIX.
>> Cooper: PAOLO CARAFA,
PROFESSOR OF ARCHEOLOGY AT

37:47.965 --> 37:55.506
SAPIENZA UNIVERSITY OF ROME, HAS
BEEN STUDYING THE ROMAN FORUM
AREA FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS.
SO, ACCORDING TO SUETONIUS,

37:55.573 --> 38:02.546
CALIGULA EXTENDED HIS HOUSE UP
TO THAT TEMPLE?
>> Carafa: EXACTLY.
>> Cooper: HAVE YOU FOUND

38:02.613 --> 38:09.186
EVIDENCE OF THAT?
>> Carafa: BEHIND TH TEMPLE,
RECENT EXCAVATION HAVE
IDENTIFIED FRAGMENTS OF A LARGE

38:09.253 --> 38:15.393
HOUSE, A LUXURY HOUSE.
>> Cooper: HE CAN'T SAY FOR SURE
IT WAS CALIGULA'S HOUSE, BUT HE
SAYS IT COMES FROM THAT TIME

38:15.459 --> 38:21.999
PERIOD, AND ONLY AN EMPEROR LIKE
CALIGULA WOULD HAVE DARED DO
SOMETHING SO SHOCKING.
HE WANTED THE TEMPLE TO BE THE

38:22.066 --> 38:27.038
ENTRANCE TO HIS OWN HOUSE?
>> Carafa: EXACTLY.
WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL.
>> Cooper: ONE OF THE THINGS

38:27.104 --> 38:33.377
"I, CLAUDIUS" SEEMS TO HAVE
GOTTEN RIGHT, WALLACE-HADRILL
TOLD US, WAS CALIGULA'S CAPACITY
FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL

38:33.444 --> 38:39.250
CRUELTY.
(<i> CROWD JEERS</i> )
>> Wallace-Hadrill: THERE'S NO
DOUBT THAT CALIGULA'S BRUTAL.

38:39.316 --> 38:46.123
BUT SUETONIUS SAYS HE'S NOT ONLY
BRUTAL, HE THINKS IT'S AMUSING.
HE TAKES PLEASURE IN IT.
>> Cooper: PERHAPS THE MOST

38:46.190 --> 38:51.962
TELLING ACCOUNT COMES FROM A
CONTEMPORARY OF CALIGULA'S, THE
PHILOSOPHER SENECA, WHO
DESCRIBES HOW CALIGULA INVITED A

38:52.029 --> 38:59.470
FATHER TO A FESTIVE DINNER ON
THE DAY HE HAD EXECUTED THE
MAN'S SON.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: AND AT THE

38:59.537 --> 39:09.246
DINNER, HE INSISTS THAT THE
FATHER SHOULD HAVE A JOLLY TIME.
HE PLIES HIM WITH WINE AND FOOD.
HE EVEN PLIES HIM WITH PERFUME

39:09.313 --> 39:12.750
AND A GARLAND.
>> Cooper: ON THE VERY DAY HIS
SON...
>> Wallace-Hadrill: ON THE VERY

39:12.817 --> 39:18.756
DAY.
AND SENECA SAYS, PEOPLE ASKED,
HOW ON EARTH COULD HE ENDURE TO
DO IT?

39:18.823 --> 39:27.431
AND THE ANSWER IS, HE HAD A
SECOND SON.
AND I THINK THAT ANECDOTE JUST
EVOKES THE ATMOSPHERE OF TERROR

39:27.498 --> 39:34.205
OF THE COURT OF CALIGULA.
>> Caligula: AAAAAAH!
>> Cooper: AS "I, CLAUDIUS"
SHOWED, THE END CAME IN 41 A.D.

39:34.271 --> 39:39.410
WHEN CALIGULA WAS STABBED TO
DEATH BY MEMBERS OF HIS OWN
IMPERIAL GUARD.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: HE'S KILLED

39:39.477 --> 39:47.952
BY HIS OWN GUARDSMEN, BUT THEN
THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CANDIDATE.
>> Cooper: THEY DON'T HAVE
SOMEBODY WAITING TO TAKE OVER?

39:48.018 --> 39:53.891
>> Wallace-Hadrill: THEY HAVE
NO ONE IN THE WINGS.
EXCEPT POOR OLD CLAUDIUS.
>> Cooper: DOES THAT ARGUE THE

39:53.958 --> 40:00.731
POINT THAT HE HAD TO HAVE BEEN
REALLY AWFUL IF THEY WERE SO
MOTIVATED TO JUST KILL HIM?
>> Wallace-Hadrill: YEAH, YEAH.

40:00.798 --> 40:11.509
IT'S AN ASSASSINATION BORN OF
ANGER, HUMILIATION, DISGUST.
"WE CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE."
>> Cooper: LONG AFTER THE

40:11.575 --> 40:18.749
ASSASSINATION ITSELF, SOME
HISTORIANS BELIEVE, CALIGULA'S
ENEMIES ASSASSINATED HIS MEMORY
AS WELL.

40:18.816 --> 40:26.824
THERE'S A NUMBER OF CONTEMPORARY
SCHOLARS WHO HAVE ARGUED THAT
CALIGULA'S CRITICS DISTORTED HIS
MEMORY, THAT THEY HAVE FALSELY

40:26.891 --> 40:30.728
MADE HIM OUT TO BE FAR WORSE
THAN HE WAS.
>> Wallace-Hadrill: OF COURSE.
IT'S LIKE ENTERING A HALL OF

40:30.795 --> 40:36.734
MIRRORS AND, YOU KNOW, SOME OF
THEM ARE CONCAVE, AND SOME ARE
CONVEX.
AND THERE ARE NO FLAT MIRRORS.

40:36.801 --> 40:46.911
>> Cooper: BUT ISN'T THAT
TERRIFYING, THAT WHAT WE THINK
WE KNOW ABOUT HISTORY IS SO
DEPENDENT ON RUMORS, OR...

40:46.977 --> 40:54.752
>> Wallace-Hadrill: BUT I THINK
IT'S AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE TO
LOOK AT THE PAST AS A SERIES OF
SOLID ROCKS THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT

40:54.819 --> 41:02.259
WAS DEFINITELY THERE.
AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY...
IT'S-- IT'S A GREAT MORASS, A
FLOWING SEA.

41:02.326 --> 41:08.399
I THINK THAT ANCIENT HISTORY'S
VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE,<i> BECAUSE</i>
IT'S GOT SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN
IT.

41:08.465 --> 41:14.438
>> Cooper: BUT WHY IS IT GOOD
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
MISINFORMATION?
>> Wallace-Hadrill: IT'S GOOD

41:14.505 --> 41:19.410
BECAUSE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN
IS FULL OF MISINFORMATION,
AS WE HAVE LEARNED SPECTACULARLY
IN RECENT YEARS.

41:19.476 --> 41:26.383
YOU KNOW?
PEOPLE INVENT TRUTHS.
YOU HAVE TO BE SKEPTICAL.
>> Cooper: AS WE PREPARED TO

41:26.450 --> 41:31.522
LEAVE THE NYMPHEUM MUSEUM, WE
COULDN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT HOW
TIME TRAMPLES EVEN THE MIGHTIEST
OF EMPIRES, TURNING LAVISH

41:31.589 --> 41:37.127
GARDENS INTO UNDERGROUND PARKING
LOTS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK CALIGULA WOULD
THINK OF-- OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO

41:37.194 --> 41:41.932
HIS GARDENS?
>> Serlorenzi (<i> translated</i> ):
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
I THINK HE WOULD BE IN TOTAL

41:41.999 --> 41:48.739
DISAGREEMENT.
AND, I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY THAT WE ARE SITTING
ON HIS STAIRCASE.

41:48.806 --> 41:58.382
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>><i> HOW DID A MOSAIC FROM</i>
<i>CALIGULA'S REIGN TURN UP AS A</i>
<i>COFFEE TABLE IN A NEW YORK CITY</i>

41:58.449 --> 42:04.588
<i>APARTMENT?</i>
<i>THAT STORY, AT</i>
<i>60minutesovertime.com.</i>

42:08.659 --> 42:14.698
>> Whitaker: ON THURSDAY THIS
WEEK, THE PUMPKIN PIE WILL TASTE
A LITTLE SWEETER.
THE GREEN BEANS AND ALMONDS WILL

42:14.765 --> 42:20.604
HAVE AN EXTRA SNAP.
THE STUFFING WILL BE A LITTLE
RICHER, AND THE GIBLET GRAVY
LESS LUMPY.

42:20.671 --> 42:27.011
THE TURKEY WON'T TASTE THE LEAST
BIT DRY.
THIS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY TWEAKING OF THE RECIPES

42:27.077 --> 42:32.583
FOR THE FEAST ON THE
THANKSGIVING TABLE.
IT HAS<i> EVERYTHING</i> TO DO WITH THE
FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS

42:32.650 --> 42:41.091
GATHERED AROUND IT.
FAMILIES ARE PLANNING TO COME
TOGETHER AGAIN-- WITH CARE,
CAUTION, AND VACCINATION--

42:41.158 --> 42:47.231
AFTER NEARLY TWO YEARS OF
PANDEMIC SEPARATION.
AND WHO WOULDN'T BE THANKFUL
FOR THAT?

I'M BILL WHITAKER.
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH
