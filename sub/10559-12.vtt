00:45.960 --> 00:47.439
Thank you, sir.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.397
- Miss Ogden!
- Yes?

00:55.080 --> 00:57.071
It is Miss Ogden, Miss Ruby Ogden?

00:57.160 --> 00:59.720
- Yes. Mr Carlin, is it?
- Indeed.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.198
It's been a while since we've had the
pleasure of your company in the bank.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.159
World travels, Mr Carlin. Although
I am back for a very special occasion.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.357
- Which would be?
- My sister Julia's impending nuptials.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.798
Well, then. Splendid.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.716
You hear that, Mr Russell?
You're not the only one getting married.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.473
- How thrilling.
- Here comes the lucky lady now.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.556
I beg your pardon, Mr Carlin.

01:21.640 --> 01:25.599
I wonder if you could double-check
this balance sheet. It's giving me fits.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.999
Of course, Miss Rose.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.476
Not to state the obvious,
good people, but...

01:34.080 --> 01:36.071
Oh, dear. Anyway...

01:37.360 --> 01:39.510
This is a robbery.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.197
Hmm. You, there.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.239
In the common suit
and cautious cravat.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.834
You must be the bank manager.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.754
To the vault, sir,
and be quick about it.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.873
I do have appointments.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.708
You're doing well, sir.
But it may help to breathe.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.710
Robbery in progress, Bank of Toronto.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.915
- Give the order, Captain.
- To the armoury, lads!

02:37.560 --> 02:39.949
There, now. That wasn't so bad, was it?

02:42.080 --> 02:43.638
Oh, my.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.914
Who do we have here?

02:48.280 --> 02:49.599
Mmm.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.399
Yes, well...

03:00.280 --> 03:05.035
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have been most accommodating,

03:05.120 --> 03:08.635
and I thank you for your patience.
Good day.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.113
He's so polite.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.955
He went that way.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.519
Murdoch, Crabtree, through the back.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.432
You two, into the alley.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.349
Gentlemen, the pleasure was all mine.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.279
- This constable will take your details, ma'am.
- Thank you.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.555
Any luck, Murdoch?

03:45.040 --> 03:47.395
I'm sorry, sir, the thief had
his escape well planned.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.549
Not just any thief.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.359
He planted a big wet smacker
on that secretary over there.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.112
And a tender moment it was.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.715
Miss Ogden.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.358
Ruby. My goodness,
what are you doing here?

03:56.440 --> 03:58.908
I just arrived in town
to help with Julia's wedding.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.874
Hello, Detective. Exciting times, yes?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.470
- Most assuredly.
- I'm all atwitter.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.830
<i>Make way, make way, please.
Paddy Glynn, Gazette, please make way.</i>

04:08.920 --> 04:11.275
- Inspector Brackenreid! Inspector.
- We're busy, Glynn.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.079
Ah, yes, and doing a fine job
of catching no one, I see.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.673
Tell me, did the robber kiss any women?

04:17.480 --> 04:21.598
Yes. This... kissing bandit
struck again, all right.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.876
Kissing Bandit? Ah, perfect moniker.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.476
Thank you. Thank you, Inspector.
Thank you.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.039
What did he thank me for?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.719
"Kissing Bandit. " I suppose I deserve that.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.913
Three banks in ten days,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.070
and each time the cheeky bugger
grabs a kiss from a young lass,

04:40.160 --> 04:41.718
then vanishes into thin air.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.508
- How's he doing it, Murdoch?
- Careful planning, sir.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.829
Three robberies, dozens of witnesses,
and not one usable description.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.353
He was wearing a mask.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.317
Are you trying to annoy me, Murdoch?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.949
No, sir, I share your frustration.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.194
What about the latest object
of the bandit's affections?

04:59.280 --> 05:00.793
What's she got to say?

05:01.840 --> 05:05.196
Must you ask Annabel
to relive the experience, Detective?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.918
I'm afraid so, Mr Russell.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.029
Miss Rose, please.

05:10.120 --> 05:14.272
Well, I was asking Mr Carlin
to review last month's deposits.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.191
They wouldn't balance for me.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.872
Thank you, Miss Rose,

05:17.960 --> 05:19.757
but I'm more interested
in your recollections

05:19.840 --> 05:22.479
of the moments you were closest
to the bandit.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.315
When he kissed you and so forth.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.913
Oh, of course.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.271
His arm encircled me,

05:31.080 --> 05:32.559
he didn't say a word.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.079
I remember that his hand was
warm on my waist,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.519
and the way that he dipped me back was...

05:40.040 --> 05:41.996
- Like a dance.
- A dance?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.795
He's a criminal, darling.
Violent and dangerous.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.313
Thank you, Mr Russell.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.675
All I mean to say is that he didn't hurt me.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.435
But your reputation!
Taking liberties with a woman betrothed?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.993
Of course. You're right.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.035
It's over now.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.517
Do you recall
any physical characteristics?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.513
Eye colour, for example.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.831
Truth be told, I can't really say.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.990
I mean, my eyes were closed
for most of it.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.911
You closed your eyes?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.958
Sir, none of the witnesses has given us
anything to go on.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.790
That's it? Well, perhaps I'll just
have a nap, then.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.590
Sir, I simply mean that the bandit has yet
to make a mistake of any kind.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.791
Any ideas?

06:28.880 --> 06:33.078
Well, if he's so scrupulous in not leaving
us any clue as to his identity,

06:34.080 --> 06:36.196
perhaps we can attempt
to bring the clue to him.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.990
Will that make any more sense to me
if you say it a second time?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.433
Sir, I simply mean that there is
a way to identify this bandit,

06:42.520 --> 06:44.829
regardless of how many disguises
he wears.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.509
But we'll have to wait for him
to strike again.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.279
You're gonna build something, aren't you?

06:57.240 --> 06:58.309
Hello, Jules.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.398
Ruby! I thought you were in New York.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.911
You're the only person in the world
I'd leave New York for, Jules.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.798
<i>Even if I did have to put my latest piece
for the Times on hold.</i>

07:07.880 --> 07:10.110
Oh. Well, I'm honoured.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.033
You should be.
It's an exposé on the gangs of New York.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.757
They're quite bothersome these days.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.956
I see.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.955
Father wired me to say your upcoming
nuptials to Darcy Garland are in disarray.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.669
Disarray?

07:23.760 --> 07:27.355
You haven't your trousseau, dress,
veil, gloves, shoes,

07:27.440 --> 07:29.032
flower arrangements, music.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.354
- All right, I'm a little behind.
- Behind?

07:32.760 --> 07:33.829
You're a disaster.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.119
Before you say no
to me rushing to your rescue,

07:37.200 --> 07:38.713
Father's paying for it, so it's done.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.153
I'm touched, but I still have to say no.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.310
Say the same after you see this.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.679
It's beautiful.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.268
Try it on.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.589
For me?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.235
All right.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.116
You looks so bridal.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.908
Detective.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.911
Wasn't that
an exciting bank robbery today?

08:15.560 --> 08:17.835
- Bank robbery?
- Yes, at the bank...

08:17.920 --> 08:20.354
Oh, it was thrilling. They're calling the thief
the Kissing Bandit.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.638
- Unfortunately...
- He escaped,

08:22.720 --> 08:25.109
- but William almost had him, didn't you?
- Well, I...

08:25.200 --> 08:28.556
- Goodness, Ruby, are you all right?
- Yes, I am.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.635
How can I help you, Detective?

08:34.720 --> 08:37.917
- I need to borrow some walnut oil.
- Walnut oil?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.673
Yes, I take it you use it
to stain tissue samples?

08:40.760 --> 08:43.797
Indeed.
Whatever do you need it for?

08:43.880 --> 08:45.836
A project I'm working on.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.075
Here you are.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.635
Thank you.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.155
Miss Ogden.

09:04.520 --> 09:09.116
Jules, did you ever tell Darcy
about your relationship with William?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.991
Why, of course I did.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.195
Oh? How did he take it?

09:16.960 --> 09:19.918
His usual maturity and understanding.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.193
He's sensible enough to know
that everyone has a past.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.393
Well, I'm impressed.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.632
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a great deal of shopping to do.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.034
How delightful.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.958
Sir, the Kissing Bandit has struck again.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.518
Struck may not be the right term.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.795
I opened the door, and there it was.
The box, right there on the stoop.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.229
And the note?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.118
"Courtesy of the Kissing Bandit. "

10:00.200 --> 10:02.350
There's $2,000 in that box.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.795
That's 200 less than the total the
Kissing Bandit took from the three banks.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.798
So he keeps some for himself.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.077
Look, every bed in the orphanage
can be replaced by this money.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.673
New coats for the boys, books...

10:14.080 --> 10:16.548
Mr Belford, you can't keep the money.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.715
But the banks' insurance will
assume responsibility, no?

10:19.800 --> 10:22.758
That would be the case
if the money hadn't been recovered.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.709
Of course.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.958
Mr Belford, a favour.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.512
Please say nothing to the press
should they come calling.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.514
The less they know,
the better for our investigation.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.593
- I understand.
- Thank you.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.592
Mr Carlin, I can assure you that the
Kissing Bandit case is our top priority.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.316
Your priorities won't repair
reputations, Inspector.

10:51.880 --> 10:56.317
The public sees the banks as thieves for
taking the money back from the orphanage,

10:56.720 --> 10:59.837
even though we made donations
to the orphanage in the aftermath.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.751
We recovered almost all the money.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.593
I would've thought that I'd have heard
a "well done" from you by now.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.309
There is little comfort in knowing
the Kissing Bandit is on the loose, sir,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.197
free to strike us again at any time.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.192
We're not just sitting around
comparing bunions, Mr Carlin.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.634
We do have a plan.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.638
Now, had Constable Crabtree been
the Kissing Bandit

11:19.720 --> 11:21.756
reaching into the bag
for the stolen money...

11:21.840 --> 11:23.956
The bandit's hands would be
covered in red dye.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.596
Exactly. I call it the Dye Discharger.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.672
It's based on a new British technology
called the Little Nipper.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.992
Essentially, it's a mousetrap.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.549
A mousetrap?

11:35.640 --> 11:37.676
The dye stains on the bandit's hands

11:37.760 --> 11:39.591
will last several days
before washing off.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.838
Also, some of the dye that is discharged
will end up on the money itself.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.788
Brilliant, Detective.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.594
So even if the Kissing Bandit
gets away with his next robbery,

11:48.680 --> 11:51.148
he can't give it away or spend it
without being caught.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.800
<i>Ah, you must be Carlin.
Paddy Glynn, Toronto Gazette.</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:55.518
What is he doing here?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.637
He's the one responsible for spreading
the bandit's fame far and wide

11:58.720 --> 12:01.109
with his Robin Hood comparisons.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.316
I'd just as soon as
crack him one myself, Mr Carlin,

12:03.400 --> 12:05.595
but for now we have to stomach him.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.669
Charming.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.957
Mr Glynn will alert the public
to the next robbery

12:10.240 --> 12:13.789
and ask them to report
any sightings of a dye-spattered man.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.831
And all you and the other bank managers
have to do

12:15.920 --> 12:18.878
is make sure a moneybag
with the Dye Discharger gets handed over.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.075
We'll catch him red-handed.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.799
Ooh, I like that.
I like that very much.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.075
- I do hope this works.
- It will, Mr Carlin.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.717
We'll have the Kissing Bandit
under lock and key very, very soon.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.836
And this time
you can quote me on that.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.190
- Hello, Constable.
- Miss Ogden.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.039
Did you miss me?

12:46.440 --> 12:48.795
Yes, certainly I have.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.351
- What are these notes for?
- Oh, no, it's nothing. That's um...

12:52.480 --> 12:54.789
It's just a story I'm writing.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.314
Oh. What's it about?

12:57.720 --> 13:00.109
Oh, it's just a little project
I've been fooling with.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.158
There's murder, some adventure and...

13:03.240 --> 13:06.038
Queen Victoria ends up in a bank vault
towards the end.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.838
I'm not explaining it very well.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.478
Sounds wonderful.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.513
I've missed you, by the way.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.828
Oh, yes, I'm sure you have,

13:12.920 --> 13:14.911
<i>gallivanting around the world
writing for the Times.</i>

13:15.000 --> 13:17.719
It has been a whirlwind, yes.
They sent me everywhere.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.360
San Francisco, Bombay, Russia.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.151
I interviewed a revolutionary there
by the name of Vladimir Ulyanov.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.993
- Watch out for him.
- Ulyanov. I'll be sure to, yes.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.317
You know, it pales in comparison
to organising a wedding.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.470
- You'll be attending?
- Indeed I will, yes.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.599
With someone special?

13:35.640 --> 13:36.709
Oh, I...

13:36.800 --> 13:39.712
Yes, of course, I imagine.
I mean, there are several...

13:39.800 --> 13:41.677
I haven't confirmed anyone yet.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.239
I see.
Well, I look forward to seeing you there.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.598
So do I. Look forward to seeing you...

13:49.640 --> 13:50.868
Attention, gentlemen.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.270
The Kissing Bandit has robbed
the Bank of Toronto.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.429
Again.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.793
He kissed...

14:02.880 --> 14:04.632
Another impressive entrance, Inspector.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.991
And of course you're too late.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.548
Bollocks. Was anyone hurt?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.915
Mr Russell's pride
may have suffered a blow.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.554
What am I to do
against a pistol-wielding thug?

14:15.200 --> 14:17.714
Miss Rose, I take it
the bandit kissed you again?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.270
- He did, yes.
- Scoundrel.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.033
Did you manage to hand over a
moneybag containing the Dye Discharger?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.155
Yes.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.196
<i>George, notify Paddy Glynn at the Gazette.</i>

14:26.280 --> 14:27.349
Sir.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.593
How much money
did he make off with this time?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.834
So soon after the last robbery,
there wasn't more than $100 in the vault.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.558
He took it all.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.349
He gives most of his plunder
to the orphanage,

14:38.440 --> 14:39.998
then sticks up the same bank twice,

14:40.080 --> 14:43.117
knowing there won't be much of anything
in the vault the second time around.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.839
What if it's someone with a personal gripe
against the Bank of Toronto?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.399
- Personal, sir?
- Yeah.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.712
Former employee,
or even a customer with a grudge.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.237
But then why rob the Kings
and the Dominion banks as well?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.351
To throw us off.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.396
I suppose we shouldn't
discount the possibility.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.959
Have the lads re-interview the employees.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.156
See if they can think of anyone
with a reason to resent the bank.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.675
Yes, sir.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.548
If you'll excuse me.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.151
Just be quick about it.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.753
Scotch.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.955
You know I don't like
to beat around the bush, Detective,

15:17.040 --> 15:18.712
so I'll get right to the point.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.791
It's about my sister.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.632
You must be happy for her.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.269
After all this time with the two of you
being such good friends, I mean.

15:26.880 --> 15:31.670
I am in fact quite happy
that Julia has found someone to love.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.754
I can't say I'm surprised
by such a feeble response.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.516
Have you come here to insult me?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.439
I hadn't planned to.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.919
Then what?

15:43.880 --> 15:45.438
I haven't met the man,

15:45.520 --> 15:49.433
and he may be the most handsome,
dashing and exhilarating creature,

15:49.800 --> 15:52.155
but is it your opinion
that Dr Darcy Garland

15:52.240 --> 15:55.152
is the only man in the entire world
who can make Julia happy?

15:55.880 --> 15:59.555
Dr Garland is a fine fellow.
He's a gentleman...

15:59.640 --> 16:01.835
Oh, for goodness' sake, William!
Do you still love her?

16:03.080 --> 16:06.117
My feelings for Julia are
my concern, Miss Ogden.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.911
Why are men so dim-witted
when it comes to love?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.514
So I am feeble and dim-witted now.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.192
I understand that the Kissing Bandit

16:15.280 --> 16:17.430
returned to the bank
and kissed the same woman.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.114
- That's correct.
- And from what I saw the other day,

16:20.200 --> 16:23.237
Miss Rose was enthralled by his touch,
quite to her astonishment.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.836
Which brings me to my point.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.230
A woman can love a man
simply because he's a useful helper,

16:29.320 --> 16:31.117
as is often the case,

16:31.200 --> 16:34.954
or she can be so captivated that her
love for him is quite beyond her control.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.597
I have no idea
what you're trying to say to me.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.829
What I'm saying is that

16:42.960 --> 16:46.111
Miss Rose and even this lowly bandit
understand that

16:46.840 --> 16:48.717
when the heart is captive,

16:48.800 --> 16:52.554
a second choice, no matter how useful,
can never bring true happiness.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.910
Are you prepared
to resign yourself to such a fate?

16:57.040 --> 17:00.396
I wasn't aware that I had resigned myself
to anything in particular.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.240
But you have given me
some insight into this case.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.435
I have?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.198
- I didn't intend to.
- Yes.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.353
Thank you, Miss Ogden,
but I have work to do.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.714
Oh!

17:13.880 --> 17:14.949
Well...

17:23.040 --> 17:26.112
Oh, Miss Rose,
I wonder if I might have a word.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.272
Oh, but I'm on my way to lunch, Detective,
and they only give us 20 minutes.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.874
Yes. I'll see to it
Mr Carlin doesn't complain.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.595
Very well, then.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.312
Have you been approached of late
by any men

17:40.760 --> 17:42.637
in a flirtatious manner?

17:42.720 --> 17:43.789
Flirtatious?

17:44.160 --> 17:46.833
Yes, anonymous flowers,

17:46.920 --> 17:50.435
letter from a former suitor
out of the blue, professing his love?

17:50.520 --> 17:52.431
I can't think of such an instance.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.792
My goodness, such questions.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.199
I don't mean to alarm you,
but given recent events,

17:58.280 --> 18:02.114
it's possible the Kissing Bandit
has been captivated by you,

18:02.640 --> 18:05.837
from afar, and has chosen
to make his feelings known.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.356
No, I've received no unwelcome attention.
I'm engaged, after all.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.555
Yes.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.354
Poor Rupert.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.278
I accepted his proposal of marriage,

18:14.360 --> 18:17.636
but that seems insufficient
to ward off his jealousy.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.917
- I suspect he loves you very much.
- Indeed.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.233
He's already picked out a house
for us to live in a raise a family.

18:25.880 --> 18:29.111
I'll have to leave the bank, of course,
he says, to tend to the little ones.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.232
It's all been planned.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.992
I've tried to calm his fears.
The Kissing Bandit means nothing to me.

18:36.880 --> 18:41.590
What woman would risk an assured future
for such a rogue?

18:43.640 --> 18:47.315
I can assure you the Kissing Bandit
will be brought to justice, Miss Rose,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.755
and I wish you all the happiness
in your future.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.473
Why, thanks, Detective.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.594
Sir.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.674
We spoke with every employee
at the Bank of Toronto.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.354
None of them can think of anybody
with a revenge motive.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.397
Thank you, George.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.352
Kisses, Murdoch?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.474
Yes, sir.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.276
I believe the kisses column may explain
our bandit's motivation.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.436
Of the $2300 he's stolen so far,
he's only kept $300.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.237
A tidy sum, but hardly indicative
of a man bent on enriching himself.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.870
We know that. He's a bloody
humanitarian, or so he thinks.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.030
Well, he may have started out
that way, sir,

19:41.120 --> 19:44.476
but something changed
when he encountered Annabel Rose.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.468
That's all just for show, though.
A little flair for the dramatic gesture.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.908
I don't think so, sir.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.992
I believe he went back to
the Bank of Toronto a second time

19:53.080 --> 19:54.911
to see Miss Rose.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.235
I think he's in love.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.278
Sirs?
The Dye Discharger has caught somebody.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.236
Finally, something I can understand.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.828
Not quite, sir.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.235
My wife found it on our front porch
just before noon.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.469
There was a note.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.149
May I?

20:11.240 --> 20:13.629
How did the bandit get around
the Dye Discharger?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.589
"Dear Mr Carlin, many heartfelt
apologies for the inconvenience. "

20:17.960 --> 20:21.191
So the bandit took the money out of the
bag without setting off the mousetrap,

20:21.280 --> 20:22.918
transferred the trap into the box

20:23.000 --> 20:24.911
and then delivered it personally
to Mr Carlin's doorstep.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.560
Then you open it up
and get splattered with ink.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.073
Why would he do that?

20:29.160 --> 20:33.119
I think the bandit's actions were intended
as a mocking gesture to all of us.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.509
I'm all too aware of that, Detective.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.989
Now do something about it,
for God's sake!

20:42.640 --> 20:44.710
I've been made a laughing stock.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.198
Not much of a challenge there.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.389
Murdoch, if you're convinced that

20:52.480 --> 20:55.438
the bandit will keep returning to the
Bank of Toronto, we'll post a constable.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.033
Sir, that may deter him.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.113
We need to catch the bandit in the act.
I believe I have an idea.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.833
Scrutiny camera?

21:03.920 --> 21:06.798
Yes, sir. With some refinements
and proper placement,

21:06.880 --> 21:09.952
I think we can catch the Kissing Bandit
when he least expects it.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.198
Sir, Annabel Rose and Rupert Russell
are asking to see you.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.188
The Kissing Bandit
has requested the pleasure

21:20.280 --> 21:22.157
of Annabel's company this evening
at 8:00.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.990
"The Crescent Hotel, Room 304."

21:25.080 --> 21:26.718
The man has no morals whatsoever.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.390
And here is my poor darling Annabel,

21:29.480 --> 21:32.836
horror-struck and sickened
by his brazen attentions.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.989
Miss Rose, how did you
come by this invitation?

21:38.320 --> 21:39.878
I found it on my desk at work.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.349
Who knows what harm
he has planned for Annabel?

21:43.080 --> 21:44.672
Yes, who knows?

21:45.800 --> 21:49.270
Mr Russell, I suspect if the bandit
intended to harm Miss Rose,

21:49.360 --> 21:50.873
he would have done so by now.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.235
You're suggesting she rendezvous
with this criminal?

21:53.320 --> 21:54.958
I forbid it!

21:55.440 --> 21:56.589
Mr Russell.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.034
Inspector.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.272
I share your deep concern
for Annabel's safety.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.271
Finally, a rational voice.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.590
- You will put a stop to this?
- I will.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.477
The safety of your fiancée
demands it.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.555
Well, that's settled, then.
There will be no rendezvous.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.315
Yet if you and I fail
to do everything within our power

22:14.400 --> 22:16.277
to apprehend this godless miscreant,

22:16.960 --> 22:18.188
there will be more victims.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.112
Heed this well.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.590
The consequence will rest
with you and I, Mr Russell.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.153
I cannot abide that.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.475
Can you?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.354
No, Inspector.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.917
I will allow the rendezvous.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.149
Forgive me, Annabel.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.388
All right.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.759
Working on a scheme to catch
the cheeky little bugger, are we?

22:56.480 --> 22:59.358
Yes, sir. This is a floor plan
of the Crescent Hotel,

22:59.440 --> 23:01.317
where our men will be positioned, etc.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.874
Ah, good.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.513
So, what did Miss Ruby Ogden
want with you?

23:09.120 --> 23:12.237
She was giving me suggestions
for wedding gifts.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.318
Really?

23:14.400 --> 23:17.870
It's just that I saw her moving
around here and I thought, hmm...

23:18.280 --> 23:20.077
- Something's afoot.
- Oh?

23:20.680 --> 23:23.399
The sister of the woman you've been
dancing with for years comes calling

23:23.480 --> 23:26.631
just days before the wedding,
all worked up into a lather.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.990
Tablecloths and soup spoons, was it?

23:29.800 --> 23:32.075
Given Julia's impending nuptials,

23:32.160 --> 23:35.914
Miss Ogden was unduly
concerned for my happiness.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.834
Happiness? Well, not much
of a discussion, then, was it?

23:39.920 --> 23:40.955
No.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.600
You're as straight as a die, as normal.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.549
- No regrets by my reckoning.
- No, sir.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.757
Head down, onwards and upwards,
studying floor plans.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.829
After all,

23:52.640 --> 23:54.631
there's nothing to be done
about all that, is there?

23:54.720 --> 23:56.597
No, sir, nothing to be done.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.835
Fine.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.632
So what's the plan?

24:03.600 --> 24:08.435
The Kissing Bandit is to meet Miss Rose
in Room 304 just after 8:00.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.792
<i>There's only one entrance to the hotel.</i>

24:10.880 --> 24:14.475
<i>I'll have Constables Higgins and Crabtree
stationed outside the entrance</i>

24:14.560 --> 24:16.869
<i>in case the Kissing Bandit
gets past us somehow</i>

24:16.960 --> 24:19.030
<i>and attempts to escape.</i>

24:21.480 --> 24:24.677
<i>Annabel Rose will arrive by cab
at the arranged time,</i>

24:24.760 --> 24:28.639
<i>and in the meanwhile, you and I
will be lying in wait in Room 302,</i>

24:28.720 --> 24:31.598
<i>next to Room 304,
where the rendezvous will occur.</i>

24:36.840 --> 24:39.229
That's the signal.
That's her.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.068
Shh.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.150
It's all right. Come with me.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.674
Yes?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.278
Now we wait for the bandit.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.430
Sometimes this job's just too easy.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.714
It's beautiful.

25:22.040 --> 25:26.795
I apologise for the subterfuge,
but I knew the police would be lurking.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.155
My fiancé insisted that I tell them.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.078
That was expected.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.353
Don't feel badly. We're here now.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.069
Yes.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.879
But I don't understand.

25:39.960 --> 25:43.032
You bewitched me
when I first saw you.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.153
I knew you were the one.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.318
The only one.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.393
But I'm betrothed.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.399
Your lips say otherwise when we kiss.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.716
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.119
Then close your eyes.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.878
And keep them closed.

26:14.680 --> 26:17.433
Can't hear a thing,
not even her footsteps.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.200
It's as if no one's there.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.834
Miss Rose!

26:28.640 --> 26:30.119
That's them.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.231
They will find out soon enough.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.114
I must go.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.114
Will I ever see you again?

26:41.200 --> 26:44.795
That depends. Are you still intent
on marrying your fiancé?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.389
Well?

26:50.120 --> 26:52.190
What's happening, Murdoch?

27:03.680 --> 27:05.398
Higgins!

27:11.720 --> 27:13.472
Ah, gentlemen.

27:23.800 --> 27:24.949
Bollocks.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.438
Well, he apologised sincerely
for his subterfuge.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.193
He'd guessed that
the constabulary would be waiting.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.795
Was there anything about him
that might help us?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.598
A physical description, perhaps?

27:39.920 --> 27:42.559
Well, he has very soft lips.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.514
That's all very well,
but did he say anything

27:46.600 --> 27:48.352
that might be a clue to his identity?

27:48.440 --> 27:50.112
- No.
- Well, what did he say?

27:51.480 --> 27:54.119
He asked me if I was
wholly committed to Rupert.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.475
What did you say?

27:56.560 --> 27:57.834
I gave him my answer.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.079
Annabel, my dear,
you are unharmed.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.670
You are unharmed, aren't you?

28:05.800 --> 28:07.233
Yes, Rupert.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.153
Did the scoundrel touch you?

28:09.680 --> 28:11.910
He only wanted
a moment alone with me.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.318
I'm afraid that quite inadvertently
I've captured his heart.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.798
Annabel, come with me this instant.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.598
We'll travel to my mother's home
in Beamsville

28:21.680 --> 28:23.352
where we will be safe
from this monster.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.998
- No!
- What?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.871
I'm not in danger.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.393
And I'll not go with you.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.472
You may hunt the Kissing Bandit down
in your free time if you wish

28:33.560 --> 28:36.358
and give him a good tongue-lashing
when you see him, but...

28:37.960 --> 28:39.598
I'm staying in the city.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.596
Rupert is a steadfast fellow.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.476
Mother will be ever so disappointed.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.274
It's so good to finally make
your acquaintance, Darcy.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.391
Julia has spoken so highly of you.

29:05.720 --> 29:09.030
Now I can see that she's right.
She's a lucky woman.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.072
I'm a lucky man, Ruby.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.118
I'm enjoying my position at
the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children

29:14.200 --> 29:16.555
and I'm about to have
your sister's hand in marriage.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.914
I'm content.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.509
Thank you, Eleanor.

29:19.600 --> 29:23.513
Content. And would you be content
to settle in Toronto for the long term?

29:24.080 --> 29:25.274
If Julia wishes it.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.949
Really?

29:27.160 --> 29:28.798
Well, if she's happy, then I'm happy.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.637
- Well, how selfless of you.
- What do you mean?

29:33.720 --> 29:36.393
Well... Are you sure that you're fine

29:36.480 --> 29:39.313
if Julia were to remain working
so closely with Detective Murdoch?

29:39.400 --> 29:41.356
Of course,
why wouldn't I be fine with that?

29:41.440 --> 29:43.829
Well, given their past
romantic relationship.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.272
Their what?

29:48.440 --> 29:51.034
Oh, I... I thought you knew.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.154
Well...

29:55.160 --> 29:56.639
Water under the bridge.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.356
The hour is getting late.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.113
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Miss Ogden. Good night.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.718
- Ah, sir.
- Good morning, Murdoch.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.313
- Yes, good morning.
- Thank you, Morris.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.960
Mr Belford and the orphanage
have just received the money

30:22.040 --> 30:24.076
from the latest Bank of Toronto robbery.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.071
How much are we taking back
from the downtrodden this time?

30:26.160 --> 30:27.354
$100.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.749
Do we think that Mr Goody Two-Shoes
was in on these robberies?

30:29.840 --> 30:32.115
I'm having Mr Belford brought in
for questioning.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.671
But, sir, I also installed a hidden
scrutiny camera at the orphanage.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.555
In case the Kissing Bandit returned
without his disguise.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.238
- Good work, Murdoch.
- Thank you, sir.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.073
There you are.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.592
Did you sleep well?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.874
No. You?

30:51.760 --> 30:53.113
Too much on my mind.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.155
Jules,

30:55.800 --> 30:57.870
have you spoken with Darcy
this morning?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.792
Yes, on the telephone. Why?

31:00.560 --> 31:03.028
I'm just curious if he spoke of me,

31:03.120 --> 31:06.396
voiced his opinion
of our conversation last night and so on.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.710
I believe he said you have a wild streak.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.314
But we know that, don't we?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.549
And that's all?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.115
Yes.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.550
Good. I'd hate to have made
a poor first impression on him.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.429
Darcy seems
a very understanding man.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.272
Has Father taken to him?

31:23.320 --> 31:26.392
I'm sure he's just relieved
to finally see me married off.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.391
To whom is just a detail.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.999
I doubt he'd be as relieved
were it to a policeman,

31:32.080 --> 31:34.389
regardless of William's
many accomplishments.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.311
Well, that's not an issue now, is it?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.119
Indeed. If you had truly loved William,
you would have married him.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.350
Ruby! How mean of you!

31:43.080 --> 31:46.470
You know I can't give William the life
that he wants. Children, a family.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.835
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- I've made my choice!

31:50.240 --> 31:51.878
I chose to move on, I...

31:52.040 --> 31:56.716
I chose to make my life without William so
that he could have the life that he deserves.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.279
I can't go back now.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.639
Too much has happened,
and I love Darcy.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.992
But not like you love William.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.632
I'm marrying Darcy.
That should be answer enough.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.718
I'll not speak of this again, Ruby.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.433
Me, in cahoots with the Kissing Bandit?

32:20.640 --> 32:24.110
To what end? The money
is always returned to the bank.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.156
That's beside the point, Mr Belford.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.073
Your orphanage has received
financial aid from the public

32:29.160 --> 32:32.709
as a result of the robberies, not to mention
donations from the banks themselves.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.713
Yes, but simply stating a well-known fact
is no proof of conspiracy.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.433
What is it, Constable?

32:39.960 --> 32:41.951
Sir, I developed the photographs

32:42.040 --> 32:44.508
from the scrutiny camera
outside the orphanage.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.909
I thought you'd want to see this one
right away.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.314
Paddy Glynn?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.990
So I'm being arrested
for giving to charity.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.396
Don't think you'll like
those headlines, Inspector.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.835
Now we know why
the Dye Discharger didn't work.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.952
You had prior knowledge.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.834
- You're the Kissing Bandit.
- And you're grasping at straws.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.478
Don't be a smart-arse, Glynn.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.790
You orchestrated these robberies
and played us for fools.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.029
I don't appreciate that.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.236
Inspector, the fact of the matter is

33:09.320 --> 33:12.073
I give to that orphanage
because it's the only home I ever knew.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.151
And that, gentlemen,
is a matter of public record.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.549
Ah, yes. The public record.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.076
But underwear reporters like you
help create the public record.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.551
So I became the Kissing Bandit to,
what, create a story?

33:23.640 --> 33:24.914
That's ludicrous.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.515
William Randolph Hearst started a war
in Cuba to sell newspapers, Glynn.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.511
It may be ludicrous, but it's a fact.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.477
Can't it wait?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.949
I'm sorry, sir.
It's the Bank of Toronto.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.837
The Kissing Bandit has struck again.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.314
Mr Carlin.

33:47.120 --> 33:51.033
It was the Kissing Bandit,
but he didn't want money this time.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.710
Good Lord,
it's Miss Rose!

34:07.880 --> 34:10.348
I'm told he walked straight
to Annabel.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.396
He never even announced a robbery.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.469
He bent her back as if to kiss her,
and then...

34:16.800 --> 34:18.438
You didn't witness the shooting?

34:18.679 --> 34:21.034
No, I had an appointment
with our accountants.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.828
I can't believe this happened.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.156
Thank you, Mr Carlin. That's all for now.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.518
George, what have you?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.831
Sir, several witnesses swear they heard
the Kissing Bandit say,

34:32.920 --> 34:35.514
"You betrayed me," to Miss Rose
just before the shot.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.918
"You've betrayed me"?

34:37.320 --> 34:39.356
Was he talking about
her tipping us off to the hotel?

34:39.639 --> 34:43.268
I don't think so, sir. Miss Rose indicated
that the bandit wasn't angry with her.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.679
Where is she?

34:45.199 --> 34:46.918
Oh, my God. Annabel!

34:47.560 --> 34:49.197
Mr Russell, Mr Russell.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.474
Please, let me go to her.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.437
I'm sorry, sir,
but we must preserve the scene.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.909
Now, I have to ask you
where you were 15 minutes ago.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.632
Having my lunch. Now, please!

34:56.719 --> 34:59.109
Mr Russell, please. George.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.392
Sir, a moment, please.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.236
It went straight through her heart.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.150
The barrel
was perpendicular to the body.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.870
The powder burn suggests the gun was
pressed right up against her chest.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.278
The killer left no room for error.
Cold-blooded murder.

35:25.360 --> 35:29.114
No question. Are you any closer
to working out why he did it?

35:29.480 --> 35:33.519
Perhaps. The bandit was overheard saying,
"You betrayed me. "

35:33.920 --> 35:35.478
Betrayed? How?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.397
That remains to be seen.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.836
Murder seems quite out of character
for the Kissing Bandit, don't you think?

35:41.600 --> 35:44.034
And you're sure it wasn't Paddy Glynn?

35:44.120 --> 35:46.395
He was in custody
at the time of Annabel's murder.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.516
I know. But that doesn't necessarily mean
he isn't the Kissing Bandit, does it?

35:54.200 --> 35:55.633
There are
two Kissing Bandits.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.597
Everything pointed to Paddy Glynn,

35:57.680 --> 35:59.477
but he was with us
when Miss Rose was murdered

35:59.560 --> 36:01.994
by someone impersonating
the Kissing Bandit.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.997
Well, the disguise made that easy.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.755
So if Paddy Glynn is the Kissing Bandit...

36:06.840 --> 36:08.319
Who's the Killing Bandit?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.552
Who could Annabel have betrayed?

36:19.360 --> 36:20.475
Mr Russell.

36:24.120 --> 36:27.317
How long were you
and Miss Rose engaged?

36:29.440 --> 36:31.874
Three months next Tuesday.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.632
How did you meet?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.668
At the bank, of course.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.557
So you saw her every day.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.511
Every day falling more in love with her

36:41.600 --> 36:44.831
until you worked up the courage
to ask her out socially.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.148
Yes.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.034
So when the Kissing Bandit took
an interest in her,

36:49.120 --> 36:53.079
a romantic interest,
and Miss Rose didn't protest,

36:54.120 --> 36:55.917
that must have angered you
very much.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.958
And I killed her?

36:58.040 --> 37:00.793
You were at the bank
both times the bandit struck.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.916
You saw what he wore, how he moved...

37:03.000 --> 37:06.072
But I told you I had gone to lunch
when Annabel was shot.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.435
She was your betrothed, Mr Russell.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.878
Sweet, innocent Annabel.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.830
How did it feel to know
the love of your life was slipping away?

37:16.440 --> 37:19.432
That her passions had been aroused
by a complete stranger?

37:19.680 --> 37:21.432
Well, how would you feel?

37:23.560 --> 37:25.949
Angry. Confused.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.790
Wondering if I had only done or said
something differently,

37:30.880 --> 37:33.110
perhaps I wouldn't be losing her now,
but you...

37:34.720 --> 37:36.233
You took it one step further.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.398
I loved her, Detective.

37:40.920 --> 37:45.118
Maybe I didn't make
any grand, sweeping gestures.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.954
That isn't my way.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.238
But neither is killing her.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.194
Rupert Russell did not kill Miss Rose.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.840
- For a fact?
- Strong inclination.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.395
Bloody marvellous. What now, Murdoch?

38:13.480 --> 38:15.198
Well, sir, if it's not about love...

38:15.560 --> 38:18.472
It's about the money.
It's always about the money.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.952
And that would bring us back to...

38:24.400 --> 38:25.719
Annabel?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.389
How?

38:29.280 --> 38:30.429
The Kissing Bandit.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.228
That's not possible.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.072
You seem
pretty sure about that, Patrick.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.390
Because you are the Kissing Bandit,

38:38.840 --> 38:40.592
and you loved Annabel Rose.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.828
All right, yes, but for God's sake,
I didn't murder her!

38:46.120 --> 38:48.509
The real story, Paddy.
From the beginning.

38:52.160 --> 38:56.836
I saw what happened when I added
a little creativity to my vampire stories.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.395
- Little creativity.
- The public ate it up.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.677
So I thought of a bigger stunt.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.877
I wanted to create the news,
not just report it,

39:05.960 --> 39:09.714
so I thought of a dashing figure
that the public would love.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.472
All I wanted was the fame as a journalist.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.235
Until you met Annabel.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.912
Yes.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.828
When she yielded to that first kiss,
how could I not return to her?

39:19.760 --> 39:22.069
I planned to tell her the whole truth
that night at the hotel, but I...

39:24.040 --> 39:25.837
I never got the chance.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.718
And now she's gone
because of my stupid stunt.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.199
It's my fault.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.519
You say that you gave all the money
that you stole to the orphanage.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.830
Yes, every penny.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.036
You were never tempted
to keep some of it for yourself?

39:41.760 --> 39:44.320
No. I wasn't in it for the money.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.112
Murdoch.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.117
Mr Carlin and the other
bank managers

39:58.200 --> 40:01.556
say that all of the money went
to the orphanage save for $200.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.238
Someone's lying about the money.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.992
Either Belford at the orphanage...

40:06.080 --> 40:07.672
Or the banks.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.235
Detective?

40:23.040 --> 40:25.679
Mr Carlin. Please, sit down.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.430
This makes for interesting reading, eh?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.513
The bank's deposit balance sheet
from last month.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.439
The same one
Annabel Rose queried you about.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.239
Oh?

40:38.320 --> 40:41.073
Yes, she told me
it wouldn't balance for her.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.833
I can certainly see why.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.070
Someone had been skimming
from the deposits.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.116
Miss Rose was a good worker, Detective,
but not the best bookkeeper.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.436
I see.

40:52.760 --> 40:57.038
Well, we know that the Kissing Bandit
gave every penny he stole to charity.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.954
Can you explain the discrepancy between
what the charity reported receiving

41:01.040 --> 41:04.396
and what you reported stolen from
the bank during the first robbery?

41:04.800 --> 41:06.597
Well, obviously you're wrong.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.997
The bandit kept a little something
for himself.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.351
I spoke with the bank's accountants.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.032
You had no appointment during the time
that Annabel Rose was killed.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.198
So where were you?

41:18.360 --> 41:22.148
Perhaps I confused one appointment
with another in all the upset.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.713
I'll check my appointment book.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.355
No need. I've done that for you.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.556
The name Farley Price appears
throughout this.

41:33.800 --> 41:38.396
Mr Carlin, Farley Price is known to police
for taking bets on horseracing.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.758
It turns out you owe him
a tidy sum of money.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.751
But I digress.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.197
The Kissing Bandit never wore gloves
in the initial robbery.

41:50.520 --> 41:55.753
Yet the Killing Bandit in this photograph
can clearly be seen wearing some.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.872
Perhaps it was to cover
his dye-stained hands.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.558
Annabel suggested several times

42:14.640 --> 42:18.155
that we report the discrepancies
to the bank's head office.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.792
I kept forestalling that,
and she was losing patience.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.472
When she told me she was
going to make that telephone call,

42:25.560 --> 42:28.836
I was forced to beg her not to,
but she insisted.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.358
So she betrayed you.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.115
- I am sorry.
- I'm sure.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.674
I hope I'm not intruding.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.875
Dr Garland. Please, come in.

43:23.920 --> 43:24.955
Detective,

43:26.080 --> 43:28.514
I don't know how to say this
other than forthrightly,

43:28.880 --> 43:32.555
but it has come to my attention that you
and Julia have had a romantic relationship.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.389
Yes.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.914
Oh.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.559
But it was before you and Julia met.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.315
I see.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.115
Dr Garland,

43:53.200 --> 43:55.316
you've won Julia's hand in marriage.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.037
Why trouble yourself with the past?

44:01.640 --> 44:03.232
The past is only the past

44:03.840 --> 44:05.114
if it is dead and gone.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.555
Is that the case
with you and Dr Ogden?

44:10.400 --> 44:11.992
Yes. Yes, it is.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.072
I have your assurance of that.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.076
Dr Garland, if you ask Julia,

44:19.160 --> 44:21.879
I believe she will confirm
that I am a man of my word.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.909
Very well, then.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.597
Julia is an extraordinary woman.

44:36.600 --> 44:39.478
I would fight for her in the extreme
should the need arise.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.832
As you should.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.194
Very well, then, Detective.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.277
I hope to see you at our wedding.
