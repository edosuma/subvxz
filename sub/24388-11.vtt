[Boss Baby] What I've learned from
the airplane incident: Mega Fat CEO Baby,

00:58.475 --> 01:02.062
that scooting diaper rash,
will stop at nothing to get me fired.

01:02.729 --> 01:07.984
How do I protect my job? I need a very
big win. But from where? Concentrate.

I love that jazz sizzlin'
in my little lady veins. Whoo-hoo! Yes!

It's eight o'clock. Can you turn to
the Goofball Chuck Nighttime Morning Show?

01:23.041 --> 01:27.504
That's a no, daddy-o.
This jazz is like coffee for my ears.

-Okay.
-[scatting]

01:31.257 --> 01:34.552

-What? He's my dad. He said no.

01:34.636 --> 01:40.016
[laughs] "No" is just the first word
in a very interesting conversation.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.227

as adversaries

02:11.506 --> 02:14.717

I call her Cat Cop.

-Cat Cop?
-Cat Cop.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.774
-Cat Cop?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.991

-Seems like there's a pretty big problem.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.494
I'm gonna check it out.
Oh, broken taillight.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.372
I'm pretty sure it wasn't broken
when we started driving.

-Hmm. Weird. I'll write you up a warning.
-[meowing]

02:51.045 --> 02:53.882

-[meows]
-Wait, I'm getting a ticket now

02:56.551 --> 02:59.053

-[gasps] No, officer, sir.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.815
Hey! Goo-goo ga-ga there!
Kind of funny, actually.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.736
Cat Cop's been having me pull over
a heck of a lot of baby families lately.

03:14.819 --> 03:18.239
I had no idea folks with babies
were such troublemakers.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.700
Anyway, have a nice night, folks.

the luggage for them?

03:34.339 --> 03:38.051
-What? I love helping.
-Then come over here and help me.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.761
-[Mom snoring]
-What's up?

03:39.844 --> 03:42.305
I'm trying to reconstruct what happened
while we were in Paris.

03:42.388 --> 03:47.018
"Cat Cop given real badge.
Brought on as a police mascot,

03:47.101 --> 03:50.730
this former stray turned local hero
has quickly proven her worth.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.566
After seeing the little kitten's
savvy nose for crime,

03:53.650 --> 03:58.154
the chief has promoted Cat Cop from mascot
to an official member of the force."

03:58.238 --> 04:02.700
She's come a long way since her legendary
act of heroism in Dangerous Well Park.

04:02.784 --> 04:08.039
"...said Cat Cop's partner, who's human
and not a cat." This is journalism?

04:08.122 --> 04:12.418
What's this legendary act of heroism
in Dangerous Well Park hoo-ha?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.963
I don't buy it. Something's rotten.

04:15.755 --> 04:20.635
Look! "Cat saves man from well.
The man had been in the well for hours.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.221

how to save him..."

-Does anybody have a big stick?

"...when a little stray kitten
came prancing up to the rescue."

-[all cheering]
-[Boss Baby] No, this doesn't make sense.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.611
What kind of grown man gets stuck
in a well?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.655
[both gasp]

04:40.738 --> 04:45.451
-It's Bootsy Calico!
-Of course! Oh, Bootsy, you went too far.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.162
This is perfect! It solves everything.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.832
-Uh... how?
-Stay with me, Templeton.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.709
Calico's plots have always been ruthless,

04:52.792 --> 04:56.170
but up till now, there's been nothing
actually illegal, right?

04:56.504 --> 04:57.463
Sure?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.510
-"Oh, I'm Bootsy Calico."
-Nuh-uh.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.804
-That's Football Mike.
-Just go with it.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.182
"I opened a cat restaurant
to make people love cats.

05:08.266 --> 05:12.228
I trained cats to sound like crying babies
so people hate babies.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.771
No crimes here."

05:13.855 --> 05:15.982
Hold it right there, Bootsy!

05:16.065 --> 05:20.445
I shut your cat restaurant down,
I foiled your crybaby cat plot!

05:20.528 --> 05:24.032

so I went back to helping.

throw away your potential like this.

-so give it to me now, dummy!"
-No! Remain cool! Down to earth.

12:30.875 --> 12:36.172
-Are you putting ice cream on your pizza?
-Anything I want. Negosh life to the max.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.423
[monitor beeps]

12:37.506 --> 12:40.092
-We found Bootsy, BB.
-Go time. Where is he?

12:40.176 --> 12:43.262
-He's walking into your house right now!
-What?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.766
As I was saying,
once my restaurant closed,

12:47.850 --> 12:50.102
I decided to get into real estate.

12:50.186 --> 12:55.149
I just loved finding homes for food
in people's tummies so much,

12:55.232 --> 12:59.361
I figured, why not find actual homes
for real people?

12:59.445 --> 13:03.032
[chuckles] How quickly do y'all wanna
move out of this terrible town?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.242
We've never actually considered moving.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.330
Oh, no? [scoffs] Seems like
every baby family is moving away,

13:09.413 --> 13:11.749
selling their houses to cat families.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.417
It's very trendy.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.669
We do consider ourselves trendy.

13:15.753 --> 13:20.424
You most certainly are. Oh, geez Louise,
I may even buy this house myself.

13:20.508 --> 13:24.512
[chuckles] I bet this nice baby
would love to know my kitty cats

13:24.595 --> 13:29.225
are frolicking around his old bedroom,
crib filled with kitty litter!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.769
We'd probably take the crib with us.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.731
Yes, I'd pay a lot of money
for a pretty little house like this.

13:35.814 --> 13:41.862
-I'm sorry, did you say "a lot of money"?
-It's starting to making sense now.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.823
Bootsy's using Cat Cop
to harass baby families.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.701
Why? So he can drive babies out of town!

13:47.785 --> 13:51.163
He's out there trying to get Mom and Dad
to sell him our house!

13:51.247 --> 13:55.000
-What? Why would he even want our house?
-Don't you see, Templeton?

13:55.084 --> 13:58.087
He's eliminating the competition.
Clear out all the baby families,

13:58.170 --> 14:00.923
and this town becomes
nothing but a cat-ruled netherworld!

14:01.715 --> 14:05.302

Why did you let your parents sell
the house, Tim? Why? Hut, hut, help!

14:38.085 --> 14:40.170
No!

14:40.796 --> 14:42.172
We can't move!

14:42.256 --> 14:44.049
It's negosh time, baby.

14:45.426 --> 14:49.054
There's this sprucy new house
five towns from here.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.390
And this one is even better.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.808

You're making a huge mistake staying here!
Huge! And I don't know how you did it,

15:01.358 --> 15:05.029
but here's the $5 I agreed to give you.
Good day!

15:07.781 --> 15:12.161
Thanks for buying me some time.
Tonight, we bust Bootsy.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.206
You know, a little birdy told me

15:16.290 --> 15:19.835
the Templetons
are causing all sorts of trouble.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.964
Someone from law enforcement
oughta straighten them out,

15:24.048 --> 15:27.968
even if it takes lots and lots and lots
and lots of tickets.

-Jimbo?
-[Jimbo] We got him. Yay!

15:38.687 --> 15:41.982
Ugh, no, we didn't!
This just looks like a concerned citizen

15:42.066 --> 15:45.903
-filing a grievance with a local officer.
-Come on, BB!

15:45.986 --> 15:49.949
My job's on the line, Stace.
We pounce too soon, it all falls apart.

15:50.032 --> 15:54.411
This isn't enough.
We need solid, hard, concrete evidence.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.748
You two, I want 24/7 surveillance
on Bootsy Calico.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.333
What about Cat Cop?

15:59.416 --> 16:03.212
We won't have to look for Cat Cop.
She'll be coming after my own family.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.758
Oh! Since when is this a red curb?

16:16.767 --> 16:21.313
-But that's not our litter.
-[siren blaring]

16:21.897 --> 16:26.193
Lucky for you, stealing a lawn gnome
is just a ticketable offense in this town.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.653
What lawn gnome?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
-[meows]
-Oh, come on!

16:33.867 --> 16:37.162
I'm having a harder time convincing
Mom and Dad not to sell the house.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.291
Cat Cop's really giving them,
pardon my language, big-time heck!

16:41.375 --> 16:44.670
Negotiate strong, Templeton.
I'm fixing this as fast as I can.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.587
[monitor beeps]

16:45.671 --> 16:49.425
Boss Baby, my man
with the gold star surveillance van.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.802
That's super expensive equipment,
by the way.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.264
I hope you got results because
I'd hate to tell the board of directors

16:55.347 --> 16:57.766
you're wasting money
and they should let me fire you.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.562
But, secretly, I'd love that so much,
I'd kiss it on the mouth. Mwah, mwah!

17:01.645 --> 17:04.440
I love you, firing Boss Baby. Mwah, mwah!

17:04.523 --> 17:09.069
Save your kisses, Mega Fat.
I'm seconds away from nabbing Bootsy.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.363
Please tell me we're seconds away
from nabbing Bootsy.

17:11.447 --> 17:16.869
Ugh, no proof he's giving Cat Cop orders.
He hasn't left his lair in days.

17:16.952 --> 17:21.248
-I need action! I'm so bored!
-Not me.

17:21.331 --> 17:25.461
-I saw 102 cars go by.
-Not helpful, Jimbo.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.629
Stace,
let me know the instant he makes a move.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.718

-Sorry!

17:34.386 --> 17:38.307
[gasps] Wait. You gave me
the break I needed. Look at this.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.477
Bootsy's changing the battery
in Cat Cop's li'l helmet.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.729
-So?
-That's how he's giving orders.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.399
The helmet's a remote receiver,
and Bootsy's fingerprints are all over it.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.570
-So if we get Cat Cop's helmet...
-Bootsy's busted, baby!

17:51.653 --> 17:55.407
I need a ride around the neighborhood
to find Cat Cop and steal that helmet.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.951
You think I'm just gonna give
a bike ride away?

17:58.577 --> 18:02.873

with a careful plan. There she is!

18:36.073 --> 18:39.993

She's too wily. Give me a hand.

-As they say in Dangerous Well Park,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.250
well, well, well.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.961
The park has three wells.
They're all dangerous.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.089
Listen, officer,
maybe we can work something out.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.298
[neck cracks]

18:54.299 --> 18:58.846
Then he tried to negotiate his way
out of trouble, which really got my goat.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.349
I'm gonna have to write you folks
a citation for loose children.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.059
-That's a big fine.
-[meows]

19:04.143 --> 19:06.103
[sighs] Awesome. Thanks.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.857
These tickets are costing us a fortune.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.609
We have no choice
but to sell the house to Bootsy.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.904
Maybe a change will be good for Tim.
He's really been acting out.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.659
Yeah, all that negotiating. I'm starting
to feel like he's taking advantage of us.

turned into angry salami butts.

-What are you so happy about?
-[laughs] We did get the helmet!

19:33.338 --> 19:36.967
-I swapped it out for Football Mike's!
-You can't take Football Mike's helmet.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.303
-That's what gives him football powers.
-Templeton,

19:39.386 --> 19:41.597
we've got Bootsy Calico dead to rights.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.975
My job is safe. Mega Fat CEO Baby
won't be able to touch me

19:45.058 --> 19:49.271
-when I become the hero of Baby Corp.
-But we still have to move.

19:49.354 --> 19:54.151
Who cares? It's a simple real estate deal.
You get a new house. Play it right,

19:54.234 --> 19:58.322
and you can turn this into a full bedroom
suite upgrade, with hot tub!

19:58.405 --> 20:01.658
Come on, tiger. Get in there
and negosh like I taught you.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.829
You're just trying to teach me how
to be selfish! I don't wanna be like you!

20:07.080 --> 20:10.709
I'm sorry about everything.
I don't want us to move because of me.

Come here, baby.

Ooh! Baby in a suit.
So, you've come into my lair to negotiate?

Oh, nice leverage.

So, I'm pretty much
just gonna give this to you.

All I ask is that Cat Cop is off the force
and you pay all of my family's fines.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.121
Wait a second. What's the play here?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.540
I just want my family to be happy again.

Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Family's making you soft, baby man.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.015
Mom and Dad's fines went away,
and the newspaper said Cat Cop quit.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.143
You can go bust Bootsy Calico now.
We'll all be fine.

21:51.226 --> 21:54.229
I can't bust Bootsy anymore.
I gave him the helmet.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.690
What? Why? What about your job?

21:56.773 --> 21:59.735
You really think Mega Fat
has the brains to get me fired?

21:59.818 --> 22:04.614
Just gonna be tougher to beat him now.
Besides, some things are more important,

22:04.698 --> 22:08.327
like proving to your brother
you're not as selfish as he thinks.

22:08.410 --> 22:12.497
Oh, make no mistake.
I'm still selfish, but more self... ish?

I think that's his master plan!

Six well-placed kittens.
We got him. Let's get to work.
