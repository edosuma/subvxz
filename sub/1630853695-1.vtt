WEBVTT

01:20.958 --> 01:25.166
"There was a time
when children dreaded the night,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.250
for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror."

01:30.000 --> 01:33.833
"The dark times
when those terrible sea beasts

01:33.916 --> 01:35.333
would ravage our shores,

01:35.416 --> 01:38.291
and no ship was safe on the sea."

01:40.083 --> 01:43.583
"But thanks to the hunters,
those days are over."

01:43.666 --> 01:48.958
"Today, these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon,

01:49.041 --> 01:53.875
risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures."

01:53.958 --> 01:57.875
"And the greatest of the hunting ships
is the Inevitable--"

01:57.958 --> 02:00.791
"And the greatest of the hunters
is Captain Crow!"

02:00.875 --> 02:02.250
-Yar!
-Captain Crow!

02:03.250 --> 02:06.083
I'm Captain Crow. Smelly old beast!

02:06.166 --> 02:07.541
Hey.

02:08.208 --> 02:09.583
Who's reading this story?

02:09.666 --> 02:10.750
Oh my word!

02:10.833 --> 02:11.666
What's this?

02:11.750 --> 02:15.166
Lights-out was an hour ago.
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.833
Come on. Along. Along you pop.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.291
And, Miss Maisie,

02:19.875 --> 02:22.958
the king and queen
care for you hunter orphans

02:23.041 --> 02:24.500
out of their kindness.

02:24.583 --> 02:28.791
When you disobey the house rules,
you disrespect them.

02:28.875 --> 02:33.833
So we're not going to have
any more attempts now, are we?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.208
Absolutely not.

02:38.000 --> 02:38.833
Hmm.

02:42.625 --> 02:43.625
Hmm.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.666
Fair travels, me swabs.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.333
And remember,

03:04.416 --> 03:05.958
live a great life

03:06.041 --> 03:08.125
and die a great death.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.458
-Bye-bye, Maisie!
-We'll miss you!

03:10.541 --> 03:11.791
See you tomorrow!

03:36.041 --> 03:37.875
All hands on deck!

03:40.583 --> 03:42.083
All together now!

03:42.166 --> 03:43.750
Heave away!

03:48.916 --> 03:51.125
Hold your tongues!

03:54.416 --> 03:56.541
-Where'd you see it?
-Dead ahead, Jacob.

03:57.125 --> 03:57.958
Huh.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.083
Are you sure?

03:59.166 --> 04:02.958
Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw.
Just under the surface.

04:03.750 --> 04:04.916
Then today is the day.

04:11.541 --> 04:12.875
It's the Red Bluster.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.083
I know it in me bones.

04:15.583 --> 04:16.458
See there!

04:16.541 --> 04:18.625
-Birds follow it.

04:19.208 --> 04:22.708
-We come all this way for a proper fight.
-And we'll get it, me boy.

04:22.791 --> 04:25.875
It's been 30 years
since that thing took me deadlight.

04:25.958 --> 04:27.291
Now I'll have me revenge.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.333
Aye.

04:28.833 --> 04:29.791
Well,

04:30.416 --> 04:32.291
we've passed Rum Pepper Island.

04:32.916 --> 04:35.250
It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.

04:40.416 --> 04:41.625
If we're gonna do battle

04:41.708 --> 04:44.333
with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,

04:44.416 --> 04:46.083
it's best not to wait till after.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.541
There might not be an after.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.041
Haul away, all!
Haul, you dogs!

04:58.708 --> 04:59.750
Captain!

04:59.833 --> 05:02.666
It's another hunting ship under attack!

05:05.875 --> 05:08.250
It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.

05:08.333 --> 05:11.833
-It looks like he's found a brickleback.
-I'd say it found him.

05:11.916 --> 05:13.000
We have to help him.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.625
What course, Captain?

05:23.541 --> 05:24.958
-We press on.
-What?

05:25.041 --> 05:27.750
If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,

05:27.833 --> 05:29.500
he wouldn't be in this mess.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.583
Captain, you know the code.

05:32.125 --> 05:36.791
It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.

05:39.708 --> 05:42.541
And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.750
Ms. Merino, set a new course.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.166
Aye, Captain.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.958
Strike the spanker!

05:48.041 --> 05:49.750
Clew up for an' main.

05:51.041 --> 05:52.750
Thirty years I've waited.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.375
Thirty years!

06:02.458 --> 06:03.375
Blast!

06:04.958 --> 06:07.750
Rudder to midship.
Come around!

06:07.833 --> 06:10.791
Don't worry. We'll be to the Bluster
in no time, Captain.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.375
Drive her down, Mr. Crisp!

06:21.041 --> 06:24.333
It's too much, Captain! We're going down!

06:24.416 --> 06:25.875
This is it, mates!

06:26.375 --> 06:28.625
It's been me honor to serve with ya.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.416
Haul away!

06:33.208 --> 06:35.333
By God, it's the Inevitable!

06:35.916 --> 06:38.625
Have at it, Black Bird!

06:40.208 --> 06:41.958
Let it know we're here!

07:05.583 --> 07:06.666
We've joined.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.500
We have weather gauge.
Shall we draw it upwind?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.916
Aye, and cross the T.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.708
Hard to port, Mr. Crisp!

07:13.791 --> 07:16.750
I'll have her into the wind
as high as she'll bear, Ms. Merino!

07:16.833 --> 07:21.416
Furl the main and fore,
and ease your headsails, swabbies.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.041
Mainsail haul!

07:25.791 --> 07:27.041
Here we go!

07:27.125 --> 07:27.958
Heads up.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.500
Aim low.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.875
All right, ya fish killers!

07:36.958 --> 07:39.791
We come all this way for a proper fight.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.458
And now, we'll get it!

07:53.875 --> 07:55.416
Nearly there, Captain.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.750
Aye, Sarah.

08:02.791 --> 08:05.500
Now, to port, Ms. Merino. And cross the T!

08:05.583 --> 08:07.333
You heard him, ya lubbers!

08:07.416 --> 08:09.708
Haul your mizzen! Main and fore!

08:09.791 --> 08:11.875
Make it scream, piper!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.416
Here we go!

08:24.500 --> 08:25.458
Fire!

08:39.916 --> 08:43.625
We've not discouraged our prey.
Quite the opposite, I'm afraid!

08:43.708 --> 08:45.125
Not to worry, Jacob.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.125
Clew up aloft, Ms. Merino.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.333
Haul away
your main and mizzen!

08:49.416 --> 08:50.791
Topsail, clew lines!

08:50.875 --> 08:52.791
-Haul away!
-Loose!

09:03.208 --> 09:04.458
It's diving!

09:34.583 --> 09:37.666
Get under the companionway
and don't come out till it's settled.

09:39.875 --> 09:40.958
Clever fish.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.833
It's gone upwind.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.833
Stand to. Wait for the word!

09:47.125 --> 09:50.083
You heard the captain!
Hands to braces.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.750
Stand by, all!

09:52.291 --> 09:53.666
No birds.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.750
It's smarter than we think.
The line's been severed.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.541
-It's below us.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.833
Whoa!

10:37.916 --> 10:39.000
Jacob!

11:09.041 --> 11:09.916
Whoa!

11:38.083 --> 11:39.416
Don't worry, lad.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.291
-We got it right where we want it.
-Jacob, look out!

11:47.041 --> 11:48.583
Jacob!

11:48.666 --> 11:50.791
Man overboard! Hard to port!

11:50.875 --> 11:53.916
-Haul them lines, ya swabs!
-Hard to port!

12:50.083 --> 12:51.500
Whoa!

12:53.750 --> 12:56.333
Time has come, ya devil!

14:12.708 --> 14:13.666
Captain.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.208
-Captain.
-He's coming to.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.583
Captain! Captain!

14:56.625 --> 15:00.416
Captain, the mizzen's in splinters,
and I don't like the main.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.833
She can't fight.

15:01.916 --> 15:04.250
Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.166
-Repairs shouldn't take too--
-Set a course for Three Bridges.

15:08.416 --> 15:09.375
We're going home.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.791
Right mess, aren't ya?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
Let's get you fixed up.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.291
If you know
what's good for ya,

15:28.875 --> 15:30.541
you'll keep clear of the captain.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.166
He was close enough
to smell that red devil.

15:33.250 --> 15:38.125
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.833
Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.

15:46.916 --> 15:50.541
We've taken
some right proper monsters on this hunt,

15:50.625 --> 15:53.041
and the royals will pay us accordingly.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.458
And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.

15:56.958 --> 16:00.625
Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.833
Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.

16:04.916 --> 16:06.958
It's enough to make your knees wobble.

16:08.666 --> 16:12.416
But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.

16:13.291 --> 16:16.500
This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,

16:16.583 --> 16:18.708
and she's got the scars to prove it.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.500
As do we, Jacob!

16:22.083 --> 16:22.916
Aye.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.833
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.

16:27.541 --> 16:29.750
A merchant sailor on their first voyage.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.041
A mother.

16:35.541 --> 16:36.416
A son.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.833
All hunters die of the same thing.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.458
Aye, being a hunter.

16:43.541 --> 16:45.833
That's right. Being a hunter.

16:46.791 --> 16:49.666
But every hunter dies a great death.

16:51.333 --> 16:54.750
Because every hunter lives a great life!

16:59.541 --> 17:00.916
-Jacob!

17:01.500 --> 17:03.291
Captain would like a word.

17:03.916 --> 17:06.541
Speaking of dying a great death.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.458
Nice knowing you, Jacob!

17:11.041 --> 17:16.625
We'll think of you often and fondly.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.666
You wanted to see me, Captain?

17:24.708 --> 17:25.541
Sit.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.500
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.666
We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.416
I'm… I'm just sorry it wasn't today.

17:38.166 --> 17:42.666
Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,

17:42.750 --> 17:45.541
but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.583
You steered me right today.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.708
Well, I'm… I-I'm glad you see it that way.

17:53.416 --> 17:57.791
So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.

17:58.583 --> 18:03.750
And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.000
And then what?

18:15.333 --> 18:17.083
What is to become of the Inevitable

18:18.125 --> 18:19.208
after I'm gone?

18:24.083 --> 18:25.666
Through battle and wear,

18:25.750 --> 18:29.375
every beam, block,
and spar has been replaced

18:29.458 --> 18:31.166
since the day she was launched.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.000
Yet she lives on.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.875
It's an eternal thing.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.666
But I am not.

18:48.125 --> 18:48.958
Come.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.875
Here is my greatness.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.500
My father's before me,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.166
and his father's before him.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.541
On the day we take the Red Bluster,

19:04.041 --> 19:06.375
I will make me last entry as captain.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.000
Then it'll be your time.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.541
I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.125
You'd been out there for days.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.291
But there was something in you, Jacob.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.041
A fire that wouldn't die.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.166
Then I held you,

19:33.291 --> 19:34.166
and I knew.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.875
The fates had brought me a son.

19:38.791 --> 19:42.958
And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.416
The day you found me,

19:57.916 --> 20:02.750
I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.416
If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,

20:08.166 --> 20:10.125
and it would be my honor.

20:13.708 --> 20:14.625
My boy.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.041
You're gonna do great things.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.958
It's the Inevitable!
The Inevitable's back!

20:47.041 --> 20:48.166
-Look!
-What a sight!

20:48.250 --> 20:50.375
Bet she's got a belly full of bones!

20:51.208 --> 20:52.333
The Inevitable!

21:02.125 --> 21:04.291
It's good to be home at last,

21:04.791 --> 21:07.208
but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.

21:07.291 --> 21:11.375
Captain Crow will visit
the king and queen at first light.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.208
And when the ship is ready,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.083
we'll be off to kill a monster!

21:17.166 --> 21:20.500
-We're going after the Red Bluster!

21:20.583 --> 21:23.291
So if this be our last visit
to Three Bridges,

21:23.375 --> 21:27.291
I expect some right, proper debauchery!

21:30.291 --> 21:33.708
Go on, then.
Make way for the hunters.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.000
Here we go, mates!

21:40.375 --> 21:42.666
The Crown will pay well for them horns.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.791
-So the drinks are on us!

21:45.875 --> 21:48.041
No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!

21:48.125 --> 21:49.541
Come on, then!

♪ Captain Crow is our hero
He keeps the oceans clear ♪

21:59.041 --> 22:00.916

Hmm.

22:30.708 --> 22:31.666
Hello!

22:32.625 --> 22:33.500
Hello.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.166
Me name's Maisie.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.500
Maisie Brumble.

22:36.583 --> 22:38.625
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.375
And you're Jacob Holland,

22:40.458 --> 22:43.541
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.250
Is it true you done that?

22:45.333 --> 22:46.875
Four in two days?

22:46.958 --> 22:51.041
Don't believe everything you hear, lass.
Four in two days?

22:51.541 --> 22:52.625
It was five.

22:53.791 --> 22:54.708
I heard…

22:58.791 --> 23:02.625
I heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore,

23:02.708 --> 23:05.083
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch,

23:05.166 --> 23:06.500
and swallow her up!

23:06.583 --> 23:10.083
But not no more.
And it's 'cause of the hunters.

23:10.166 --> 23:12.791
There's not a nobler profession, I says.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.458
I come from a long line of hunters meself.

23:15.541 --> 23:16.500
Is that so?

23:17.000 --> 23:21.250
Aye. Me parents were lancers.
They served on the Monarch.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.583
The Monarch.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.666
-So they're…
-Aye.

23:26.375 --> 23:28.583
That's just the way for a hunter,
ain't it?

23:29.083 --> 23:32.125
You live a great life
and die a great death.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.791
Huh. Come on.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.083
So, uh, who's looking after you then?

23:42.166 --> 23:45.000
I'm staying at a children's home
in Guelston, up the way.

23:45.708 --> 23:47.750
Except I ain't staying exactly.

23:48.333 --> 23:49.791
I'm on the run, you see.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.791
And I ain't going back.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.000
'Cause I'm joining your crew.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.250
Oh, no, you ain't.
A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.

24:01.333 --> 24:04.708
You joined the ship when you were me age,
and look at you now.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.333
You're a weapon
against nature's darkest design.

24:07.916 --> 24:09.541
It says so on page 92.

24:11.750 --> 24:15.500
Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear,
but I've been lucky more than once.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.291
There's no guarantee
of making it to page 92.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.250
Trust me.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.791
Now, you should run along.

24:24.166 --> 24:29.958
Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow.
That's a man with real authority.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.333
Do you know
where I might find Captain Crow?

24:33.416 --> 24:35.541
Hey! I… I have authority.

24:35.625 --> 24:37.875
-All right?
-You ain't captain, are ya?

24:37.958 --> 24:41.458
Uh, no, but I am captain material.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.166
"Captain material?"

24:46.208 --> 24:50.500
-Sorry. It just sounds funny.
-I mean, I will be captain.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.458
-Someday.
-Well, I intend to get on that ship.

24:54.541 --> 24:56.500
So, if you don't mind,

24:56.583 --> 24:58.375
I'll take it up with Captain Now,

24:58.875 --> 25:00.750
not Captain Someday.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.291
Hey! Put me down! Let me go!

25:04.375 --> 25:07.041
Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.958
And here's me saving you.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.333
Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?

25:11.416 --> 25:12.291
Aye.

25:12.791 --> 25:14.666
Right. Let her out there and not before.

25:15.291 --> 25:18.166
-If that's not too much trouble.
-Aye.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.208
Hey!

25:20.291 --> 25:22.125
This is kidnapping!

25:22.208 --> 25:25.416
No, love. It's the opposite
of kidnapping.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.083
-New friend, Jacob?

25:37.750 --> 25:39.416
Ah, just some kid.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.458
Urgh. Horrible things, children.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.125
You can say that again.

26:03.416 --> 26:06.041
Captain Crow!
It's full of brickleback!

26:13.791 --> 26:18.666
Well, if it isn't Captain Crow
and his loyal mates.

26:19.416 --> 26:24.541
Your Grace, as you can see,
the oceans have offered abundant prey.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.833
And I see you've taken
a full-grown brickleback.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.291
A specimen like that
garners quite a bounty.

26:31.916 --> 26:35.083
But there's something I don't see.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.208
The horn of the Red Bluster.

26:38.291 --> 26:42.708
Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor…

26:42.791 --> 26:44.875
Admiral Hornagold?

26:45.500 --> 26:50.166
…that you spotted the Red Bluster,
but abandoned your pursuit

26:50.250 --> 26:54.291
because of a certain code.

26:54.375 --> 26:59.041
The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.

26:59.125 --> 27:02.833
They pay you to kill monsters.

27:02.916 --> 27:08.958
How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?

27:11.458 --> 27:16.458
This was once a small kingdom
with a big idea.

27:16.541 --> 27:20.250
To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores

27:20.333 --> 27:24.125
and usher in a new era of peace.

27:24.208 --> 27:28.083
It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,

27:28.166 --> 27:30.791
but as long as the Bluster lives,

27:30.875 --> 27:34.291
people will still
look to the seas with fear.

27:34.375 --> 27:38.750
So today marks the beginning of a new era.

27:38.833 --> 27:42.875
The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.

27:42.958 --> 27:44.541
She's quite a sight, isn't she?

27:45.041 --> 27:48.166
The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.750
The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world

27:51.833 --> 27:56.166
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.

27:56.666 --> 27:57.833
Not in that thing.

27:57.916 --> 27:59.250
She rests too low.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.958
And them fixed cannons is useless.

28:02.666 --> 28:05.333
And her Captain is an ass.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.666
It's time
for you to leave, Captain.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.666
Your time is up.

28:11.750 --> 28:17.000
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?

28:18.166 --> 28:21.291
Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.500
It's not built for hunting,

28:24.458 --> 28:25.583
and neither are you.

28:25.666 --> 28:30.333
I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.

28:30.416 --> 28:31.625
Then you're a fool!

28:31.708 --> 28:34.375
And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!

28:34.458 --> 28:37.833
General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.

28:37.916 --> 28:42.333
We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls

28:42.416 --> 28:44.541
and drew lines on maps.

28:44.625 --> 28:46.333
You're cowards, the lot of ya!

28:46.416 --> 28:50.458
General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,

28:50.541 --> 28:53.541
and the Inevitable decommissioned.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.958
W-W-Wait, wait!

28:58.416 --> 29:00.958
Uh, Your Grace.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.250
The, uh… The Captain
is well-known for his temper,

29:05.333 --> 29:08.333
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.041
He's opened the seas

29:10.125 --> 29:13.375
and made your empire
the envy of the known world.

29:13.875 --> 29:18.250
Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,

29:18.333 --> 29:19.416
so prove me wrong.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.125
Give us one more try for the Bluster.

29:23.625 --> 29:28.125
If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.250
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,

29:30.750 --> 29:33.291
well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,

29:33.833 --> 29:35.916
and the days of the hunters will be over.

29:36.583 --> 29:37.666
Either way,

29:37.750 --> 29:38.625
you win.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.458
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.750
Then we have a contest.

29:49.583 --> 29:50.666
Get set.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.458
Go.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.500
We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.333
The days of hunters are not over.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.083
Not nearly.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.416
When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.

30:12.500 --> 30:16.916
We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.041
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.

30:19.541 --> 30:22.208
-Best to use the long spears.

30:22.291 --> 30:27.250
Them archers won't do any good,
but we've got plenty of carcass shot.

30:27.333 --> 30:30.541
We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.625
That's the way with something like this.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.500
We're ready, Captain.
We'll take that red demon.

30:36.583 --> 30:39.333
For we are hunters.

30:39.416 --> 30:41.708
And we will bring all of our skill

30:42.416 --> 30:46.125
and all of our rage down upon this beast.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.875
And there will be justice!

30:51.875 --> 30:55.000
But that will not be the end
of this great ship.

30:55.083 --> 30:58.583
For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.

30:58.666 --> 31:01.291
No one knows what dangers lurk

31:01.375 --> 31:03.208
in that terrible unknown.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.583
But it will be this ship,

31:06.625 --> 31:10.250
under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.458
-Ow!
-What was that?

31:29.416 --> 31:32.041
-It came from the keg.
-What was that?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.583
You stowed away?

31:42.666 --> 31:44.916
I stowed away.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.708
You stowed away.

31:46.791 --> 31:47.666
Uh, I…

31:48.500 --> 31:49.625
Yeah.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.000
Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.708
We're going after the Bluster.

31:53.791 --> 31:56.833
-We can't have a kid mucking about.
-What's this?

31:58.916 --> 32:01.666
The name's Maisie Brumble,

32:02.541 --> 32:05.166
but you need no introduction.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.833
You've been swallowed whole,

32:07.916 --> 32:11.125
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.

32:11.625 --> 32:15.666
But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!

32:15.750 --> 32:19.083
The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship

32:19.166 --> 32:20.500
what ever sailed.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.083
Second-greatest?

32:22.958 --> 32:25.583
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?

32:25.666 --> 32:28.250
I'm partial to the Monarch,

32:28.333 --> 32:30.708
for it's the ship me parents served on.

32:31.958 --> 32:32.875
I see.

32:33.791 --> 32:36.000
Then they died heroes, didn't they?

32:37.000 --> 32:37.833
Aye.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.041
I like this kid.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.291
-She's all vinegar.
-But, C-Captain--

32:43.375 --> 32:45.708
Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?

32:46.208 --> 32:47.500
Aye, Captain.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.333
Congratulations, Captain Someday.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.041
Uh…

33:23.708 --> 33:24.916
Sleep there.

33:26.916 --> 33:29.583
You're… Sarah Sharpe.

33:33.083 --> 33:35.750
They say no first mate
is more loyal than--

33:35.833 --> 33:36.916
That's enough.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.333
I've heard your speeches, Miss.

33:39.416 --> 33:42.250
My speeches kept me on this boat.

33:42.333 --> 33:46.291
You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.

33:47.916 --> 33:49.500
The hunt is all.

33:50.416 --> 33:53.416
So give him your absolute obedience.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.375
Or fall on that yourself,

33:58.458 --> 34:01.250
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.416
You're

34:04.333 --> 34:06.041
amazing.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.958
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.208
We've reached the Dregmorr.

34:29.291 --> 34:32.375
Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.

34:37.541 --> 34:42.000
I wonder if I might need
something a little… larger?

34:42.083 --> 34:44.166
Hey, where'd you get that knife?

34:44.250 --> 34:47.625
Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.

34:48.125 --> 34:51.708
-A hunter who needs to go to bed.
-But I'm too much awake to sleep.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.291
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.833
Them pictures in me books come to life,

34:56.916 --> 34:59.750
and exacting bloody revenge!

34:59.833 --> 35:02.041
Go, get your rest.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.083
Aye, Captain.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.416
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.458
And they'll make statues of us.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.708
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!

35:11.791 --> 35:13.166
Hmm.

35:16.166 --> 35:17.875
The monsters, I can handle.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.458
But that one, she'll be the death of me.

35:22.041 --> 35:25.750
You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before

35:25.833 --> 35:27.541
and all who come after.

35:29.916 --> 35:31.708
I see a fire in her.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.791
Same fire I saw in you.

35:43.791 --> 35:44.875
Beat to quarters!

35:45.625 --> 35:47.208
Let's have her ready!

35:47.708 --> 35:50.791
Today's the day we do what we do!

35:55.208 --> 35:58.125
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!

35:58.208 --> 36:02.333
Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!

36:04.416 --> 36:05.916
Heave away!

36:15.875 --> 36:17.250
Brace!

36:35.125 --> 36:38.916
The ocean has sent us its worst,
and we'll send it right back.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.250
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!

36:41.333 --> 36:42.958
Protect our broadside.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.583
All right, ya fish killers!

36:46.666 --> 36:49.500
We come all this way
for a proper fight and--

36:49.583 --> 36:50.416
Jacob!

36:51.375 --> 36:52.458
What's happening?

36:52.958 --> 36:54.791
Maisie, get back to your room!

36:55.500 --> 36:56.958
-Go.

37:05.416 --> 37:07.208
Stay away from the window.

37:13.791 --> 37:14.833
Hurry, lad!

37:30.458 --> 37:31.375
Fire!

37:46.125 --> 37:48.250
Now's our chance! Spears!

38:05.583 --> 38:08.458
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.

38:08.541 --> 38:10.375
Full sail, Ms. Merino!

38:10.458 --> 38:13.000
Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!

38:13.083 --> 38:16.750
It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.

38:21.625 --> 38:24.291
Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!

38:43.833 --> 38:44.750
Captain?

38:47.791 --> 38:50.458
We've got you now.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.333
The ship can't take it.

39:28.416 --> 39:29.958
We have to cut the lines.

39:30.041 --> 39:33.041
I've never run from a fight,
and I won't start now.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.166
We must!

39:34.250 --> 39:36.666
Even dead, it'll drag us to the bottom!

39:54.833 --> 39:57.583
Time has come for ye, ye devil.

40:05.416 --> 40:09.541
Maisie Brumble, cut those lines,
and I'll kill you for a coward!

40:12.625 --> 40:14.083
Jacob, stop her!

40:36.666 --> 40:38.208
Jacob!

41:22.916 --> 41:25.625
-Bring her to me!

41:27.458 --> 41:30.250
-What are you gonna do?
-I said bring her to me!

41:30.333 --> 41:32.791
-She's just a child.
-I'm giving you an order!

41:33.375 --> 41:34.625
Please, Captain.

41:34.708 --> 41:37.958
Bring… her… to… me.

41:44.166 --> 41:45.333
Jacob!

42:17.916 --> 42:18.833
Are we gonna

42:19.625 --> 42:21.625
die in here?

42:29.625 --> 42:30.458
No.

42:36.333 --> 42:37.166
Well,

42:37.958 --> 42:38.916
yeah.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.875
Is it gonna chew us,

42:44.375 --> 42:50.250
or will we get digested slowly with acids?

42:50.333 --> 42:53.958
I don't know, Maisie.
This is all new territory for me.

42:54.041 --> 42:56.750
Haven't you hunted these things
your whole life?

42:56.833 --> 42:59.166
We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.

43:03.416 --> 43:04.958
I guess it's time to start.

43:17.125 --> 43:17.958
Jacob,

43:18.541 --> 43:20.000
what if it swallows you?

43:21.000 --> 43:22.041
Cut the rope.

45:14.708 --> 45:17.041
-What are you going to do?
-I'm gonna kill it.

45:17.125 --> 45:18.708
Kill it? How?

45:18.791 --> 45:21.791
Well, I don't know.
I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.

45:21.875 --> 45:24.833
I don't want to overthink this, all right?
I'm just gonna kill it.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.541
I don't know about this.

45:27.625 --> 45:29.166
I'm Jacob Holland, remember,

45:29.250 --> 45:31.708
who killed five of them beasts
in the span of two days.

45:31.791 --> 45:34.541
And this is just another beast.

45:37.208 --> 45:39.416
There has to be another way!

45:39.500 --> 45:40.750
Afraid not, lass.

45:40.833 --> 45:43.875
Well, c-can you kill it from the inside?

45:44.875 --> 45:46.416
-Whoa!

45:48.541 --> 45:50.791
-Whoa!

46:25.333 --> 46:26.541
Hold on, lass.

46:31.208 --> 46:32.125
Huh?

46:36.833 --> 46:38.333
-Jacob!

47:26.666 --> 47:27.625
No, wait!

47:37.041 --> 47:40.083
-Oof!

47:49.250 --> 47:51.083
W-W-Wait, Jacob! No!

47:51.166 --> 47:52.041
Stop!

48:02.791 --> 48:04.375
Oh bloody hell.

48:04.458 --> 48:05.333
Whoa!

48:09.333 --> 48:11.541
Whoa. Whoa!

48:32.500 --> 48:34.458
You could've killed me!

48:34.541 --> 48:36.375
Wha… I could have killed you?

48:38.083 --> 48:39.625
You got it backwards, lass.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.458
I had it dead to rights,
and you bollocksed it up.

48:42.541 --> 48:43.666
Dead to rights?

48:43.750 --> 48:45.916
I must have been watching
a different fight.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.333
We wouldn't have been fighting at all
if you hadn't cut them lines.

48:49.416 --> 48:50.875
We cut them lines.

48:50.958 --> 48:53.291
No, you cut them lines.

48:53.375 --> 48:55.041
You didn't stop me, did ya?

48:55.125 --> 48:57.000
That's not the same thing.

48:57.083 --> 48:58.041
Isn't it?

48:58.833 --> 49:00.750
No, it isn't.

49:18.875 --> 49:21.250
We'd best find shelter.

49:46.708 --> 49:47.666
Get your strength.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.791
We're leaving in the morning.

50:04.833 --> 50:07.958
Me book says the beasts
used to come right up to shore.

50:08.958 --> 50:10.583
That nowhere was safe.

50:11.666 --> 50:12.583
Is that true?

50:13.916 --> 50:15.166
Of course it's true.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
You saw it?

50:17.583 --> 50:21.166
It was before my time,
but everyone knows it's true.

50:22.125 --> 50:25.375
What if them things
ain't as bad as they say?

50:25.958 --> 50:28.166
I mean, the sea is their home.

50:28.916 --> 50:31.000
We went after her, didn't we?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.291
What if we just left 'em alone?

50:34.375 --> 50:37.041
We kill them because they kill us.

50:37.125 --> 50:40.708
Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?

50:40.791 --> 50:42.833
Should they have just left
the monsters alone?

50:43.875 --> 50:46.708
I… don't know.

50:46.791 --> 50:48.875
Oh, you are lost, girl.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.625
Your parents died heroes.

50:52.625 --> 50:53.958
I want to believe that,

50:55.041 --> 50:59.458
but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong.

51:00.791 --> 51:04.333
-You're not making--

51:06.208 --> 51:09.125
-You're not making any sense.
-Why did Red swallow us?

51:09.208 --> 51:10.625
Oh, "Red," is it?

51:10.708 --> 51:12.083
She, not it.

51:12.166 --> 51:15.458
I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.

51:15.541 --> 51:18.416
You're giving that beast
way too much credit.

51:18.500 --> 51:22.750
-He was pointing a gun at you, and he–
-He was pointing it at you, through me.

51:22.833 --> 51:24.750
Because you cut them lines.

51:24.833 --> 51:26.666
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?

51:26.750 --> 51:29.708
'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters

51:29.791 --> 51:30.833
on this island,

51:30.916 --> 51:34.041
that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!

51:35.750 --> 51:37.125
So we're not arguing?

51:38.125 --> 51:39.250
So what are we doing?

51:43.458 --> 51:46.666
I'm going to gather supplies.

51:46.750 --> 51:50.291
I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,

51:51.333 --> 51:53.125
we'll finish what we started.

51:55.666 --> 51:58.041
Don't… get killed out there.

51:59.041 --> 52:00.750
I won't make any promises.

52:02.291 --> 52:03.125
Jacob.

52:05.750 --> 52:06.583
Promise.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.083
All right.

52:10.041 --> 52:10.875
I promise.

52:39.000 --> 52:39.833
Captain,

52:40.583 --> 52:41.833
the beast is gone.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.500
We can't stay out here.

52:45.708 --> 52:47.458
That thing took Jacob.

52:47.541 --> 52:50.333
And I want it dead same as you,

52:50.416 --> 52:53.125
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.

52:55.500 --> 52:58.458
She's making more water
than we can pump out.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.958
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.

53:01.041 --> 53:04.000
If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.

53:08.875 --> 53:12.291
Shape a course for Mukesh Island.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.583
-But the closest port is–
-Mukesh!

53:17.166 --> 53:20.083
It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.

53:22.041 --> 53:26.541
Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?

53:28.500 --> 53:32.250
Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.

53:32.333 --> 53:36.458
To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.

53:36.541 --> 53:39.083
Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!

53:39.666 --> 53:41.916
There be no charter over me own.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.750
I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.

53:45.833 --> 53:47.916
I'd cleave the very sea

53:48.000 --> 53:52.625
and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.

53:53.208 --> 53:54.791
But I'll have vengeance.

53:56.791 --> 53:59.708
I'll have vengeance.

54:24.666 --> 54:28.916
Trim the sails
for a new course! Keep her full and by!

55:09.666 --> 55:12.333
-Hey, little guy.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.125
These things ain't so bad.

55:43.333 --> 55:44.166
Uh…

55:49.666 --> 55:51.000
What are you doing?

55:51.541 --> 55:52.375
I, uh…

55:53.333 --> 55:56.625
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.

55:56.708 --> 55:58.666
You're probably right.

55:58.750 --> 56:00.958
Just don't move.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
I'm sorry,

56:05.500 --> 56:07.416
but I've always wanted a pet.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.416
That's not a pet.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.458
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.

56:12.541 --> 56:14.375
But I already named it.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.291
Let me guess.

56:15.791 --> 56:16.791
Blue.

56:18.666 --> 56:20.916
You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.458
We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.

56:24.541 --> 56:26.208
But he's so cute!

56:26.291 --> 56:27.750
Look at this face.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.166
You and I have a different idea of cute.

56:33.166 --> 56:34.166
No!

56:36.000 --> 56:37.541
When we get to Guelston,

56:38.125 --> 56:41.833
I'll get you a cat,
and you can name it Grey or White.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.541
Ginger, if you like.

56:43.625 --> 56:45.333
You're too young to be this mean.

56:45.416 --> 56:49.000
And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.

56:49.083 --> 56:51.250
It ain't childish to want a pet.

56:51.333 --> 56:52.916
Lots of people have pets.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.166
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth

56:55.250 --> 56:57.916
that hatch and burst out
through your chest cavity!

56:58.583 --> 57:01.958
That is so specific.

57:02.041 --> 57:03.916
Well, I seen some things, all right?

57:04.500 --> 57:06.291
Point is we don't know what he'd do.

57:06.375 --> 57:08.125
We don't know anything about this island,

57:08.208 --> 57:10.125
except we've got to get off it,
by thunder!

57:22.250 --> 57:24.041
-Uh…

57:35.416 --> 57:36.333
Best be going.

57:47.125 --> 57:49.958
Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.

57:50.041 --> 57:52.125
It's the mother goose I'm worried about.

58:00.291 --> 58:02.250
There she is. Come on, lass.

58:30.625 --> 58:31.750
Hmm.

58:34.333 --> 58:35.541
Hold the rudder.

58:37.916 --> 58:41.916
If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.541
The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.

58:45.041 --> 58:48.583
If there's one of them things
within a mile of us, I'll sense it.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.791
May be a little off my game here.

58:58.666 --> 58:59.916
Jacob!

59:41.250 --> 59:42.583
Hold on, Maisie!

1:01:37.833 --> 1:01:38.666
Maisie.

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:42.708
Maisie?

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:44.166
Maisie!

1:01:45.291 --> 1:01:46.458
Maisie!

1:01:53.583 --> 1:01:54.583
Good boy.

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:11.208
We have to go back.

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:16.041
-We'll never make it!
-Depends on how fast you can bail.

1:02:25.666 --> 1:02:27.291
Maybe Red can take us!

1:02:27.375 --> 1:02:28.875
Back to the island?

1:02:28.958 --> 1:02:30.125
No, back home!

1:02:30.208 --> 1:02:32.000
You have really lost it.

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:34.250
She saved us from that thing, didn't she?

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.583
Wait… She…

1:02:36.208 --> 1:02:37.041
Are you…

1:02:37.125 --> 1:02:39.416
I think I did the saving, right?

1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:43.291
I mean, I threw the, the…
Get bailing! The water's coming in!

1:02:46.333 --> 1:02:47.166
Hey!

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:48.208
Red!

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:52.166
-See this little guy?

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:55.791
This is you.

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.625
You're wasting your time.

1:02:58.708 --> 1:03:00.458
And this is me.

1:03:00.541 --> 1:03:02.375
And this is him.

1:03:04.208 --> 1:03:07.375
Are you putting on a puppet show?
We're sinking here.

1:03:07.458 --> 1:03:10.000
We need to get way over there.

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:13.625
And I wonder
if you might be good enough to take us?

1:03:33.708 --> 1:03:37.541
Well, if she does understand ya,
she don't wanna help.

1:03:37.625 --> 1:03:39.458
Bright side? She didn't eat ya.

1:03:39.958 --> 1:03:41.750
Now, get bailing.

1:03:54.208 --> 1:03:55.708
-Whoa!

1:04:08.458 --> 1:04:10.958
I told you she was more than a beast!

1:04:22.041 --> 1:04:24.000
Woo!

1:04:26.458 --> 1:04:28.666
The world is wide, Jacob.

1:04:28.750 --> 1:04:30.708
And you don't know everything.

1:04:52.916 --> 1:04:55.916
With the right heading,
we'll be there in three days.

1:05:02.166 --> 1:05:05.916
All right, beast.
I need you to turn.

1:05:06.500 --> 1:05:08.375
Okay? Can you turn?

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:13.791
Can you turn to starboard, yeah?

1:05:13.875 --> 1:05:15.000
To the right.

1:05:15.541 --> 1:05:17.583
Right, ya dumb beast. Right.

1:05:17.666 --> 1:05:21.833
-Can you turn to the right? That way!
-You can scream all day.

1:05:21.916 --> 1:05:23.458
She don't understand ya.

1:05:23.541 --> 1:05:25.333
Oh, she understands, all right.

1:05:26.416 --> 1:05:28.583
She's just being monstrous.

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:34.708
I need you
to turn to the starboard.

1:05:34.791 --> 1:05:38.000
Over there, right where I'm pointing?
That's starboard. That's the right.

1:05:38.083 --> 1:05:40.875
More to the right.
Look, see? Over there, right!

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:44.083
Turn to the right,
you infernal bloody sea beast!

1:05:45.833 --> 1:05:48.333
He's wondering if you might turn a smidge.

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:50.541
Like this, see?

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:02.458
That's it!

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:05.083
Thanks, girl!

1:06:12.541 --> 1:06:13.625
Not so hard.

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:16.500
She ain't no pet.
Just don't let your guard down, all right?

1:06:16.583 --> 1:06:19.916
You can relax, Captain.
She's a friend.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.416
-Yeah, right. Till she gets hungry.
-Oh, will you just…

1:06:54.416 --> 1:06:55.375
Hmm.

1:08:08.291 --> 1:08:11.291
-Is that the Inevitable?
-What are they doing here?

1:08:16.875 --> 1:08:17.708
Captain!

1:08:18.708 --> 1:08:21.916
We don't need this. We're hunters.

1:08:22.458 --> 1:08:23.750
Only if we kill it.

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:57.250
I know why you're here, Captain.

1:08:57.791 --> 1:09:01.333
It's always the same reason, you see.

1:09:03.125 --> 1:09:06.541
And I can give you what you need.

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:13.291
A poison powerful enough
to take down the greatest of beasts,

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:18.041
and a weapon strong enough
to deliver it deep.

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:24.041
You know what they say about me, Captain?

1:09:24.666 --> 1:09:29.500
Them what come see Gwen Batterbie
get what they want,

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:33.083
but won't see a good day after.

1:09:34.083 --> 1:09:36.500
Yet, here you are.

1:09:36.583 --> 1:09:39.083
I don't believe in them superstitions.

1:09:40.083 --> 1:09:43.125
No, I don't suppose you do.

1:09:45.583 --> 1:09:47.291
But you will.

1:09:51.375 --> 1:09:54.375
It's me most terrible creation.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.541
The Hand of God, I calls it.

1:09:59.458 --> 1:10:00.708
What will it cost me?

1:10:01.208 --> 1:10:02.750
Everything, Captain.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:06.291
I take everything.

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:11.458
So, do we have a deal?

1:10:34.208 --> 1:10:35.041
Huh?

1:11:05.958 --> 1:11:09.833
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh…
I'm used to a bigger target, all right?

1:11:30.333 --> 1:11:31.541
Huh.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:06.208
It says here that during the dark times,

1:13:06.291 --> 1:13:09.333
the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.

1:13:09.416 --> 1:13:13.666
But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,

1:13:13.750 --> 1:13:15.500
destroyed or otherwise.

1:13:16.583 --> 1:13:19.541
A-And… And we don't say "yar"
half this much.

1:13:19.625 --> 1:13:21.958
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."

1:13:22.041 --> 1:13:24.250
I mean, this is just nonsense.

1:13:24.333 --> 1:13:25.583
Says you.

1:13:26.541 --> 1:13:28.333
But the book says otherwise,

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:31.625
and it's going to outlast both of us.

1:13:31.708 --> 1:13:36.166
So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,

1:13:36.875 --> 1:13:38.916
and hunters like to say "yar."

1:13:42.875 --> 1:13:44.166
But if that ain't true,

1:13:45.916 --> 1:13:48.166
then how are you supposed to know what is?

1:13:48.250 --> 1:13:49.875
And how do we know the sea beasts

1:13:49.958 --> 1:13:52.750
ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?

1:13:53.250 --> 1:13:56.083
That there really were the dark times?

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:59.833
Maybe they didn't start this war.

1:14:02.333 --> 1:14:03.166
Maybe, but

1:14:03.916 --> 1:14:05.083
why would we?

1:14:20.333 --> 1:14:22.791
Looks like a real shipwrecker.

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:09.666
Nicer down here, I'd say.

1:15:11.375 --> 1:15:12.291
Aye.

1:15:12.791 --> 1:15:13.916
Nicer down here.

1:16:10.166 --> 1:16:12.791
I don't know how the war started.

1:16:15.916 --> 1:16:19.333
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.

1:16:43.583 --> 1:16:45.000
It's a blood moon.

1:16:46.041 --> 1:16:47.291
Batterbie's watching.

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:50.750
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.

1:16:50.833 --> 1:16:54.333
And dealing with her ain't honorable.

1:16:54.416 --> 1:16:56.333
Aye. There'll be a payment due,

1:16:56.416 --> 1:16:59.375
and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:01.291
Sarah!

1:17:05.375 --> 1:17:06.375
Look there.

1:17:12.750 --> 1:17:14.333
Riddlebacks.

1:17:14.416 --> 1:17:15.375
Aye.

1:17:15.875 --> 1:17:17.708
They don't come this far north.

1:17:18.750 --> 1:17:21.125
Not unless they're swimming
away from something.

1:17:21.958 --> 1:17:25.416
And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:26.875
The Bluster.

1:17:37.708 --> 1:17:40.958
Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.

1:17:41.041 --> 1:17:42.708
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.

1:17:42.791 --> 1:17:47.000
Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!

1:17:47.583 --> 1:17:49.083
Haul away now!

1:17:49.166 --> 1:17:50.791
Haul away, all!

1:17:52.458 --> 1:17:53.583
We'll find you.

1:17:54.625 --> 1:17:56.500
We'll find you soon enough.

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:13.708
That ain't you no more.

1:18:14.625 --> 1:18:17.500
You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.166
in a span of two days.

1:18:19.250 --> 1:18:20.125
It was five.

1:18:20.208 --> 1:18:23.416
You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:24.750
saved me life,

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:28.416
and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.

1:18:30.833 --> 1:18:32.041
We made it.

1:18:37.750 --> 1:18:39.500
This is as far as Red goes.

1:18:40.250 --> 1:18:42.500
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,

1:18:42.583 --> 1:18:44.166
but we can flag a passing ship.

1:18:45.708 --> 1:18:46.583
And then what?

1:18:48.208 --> 1:18:51.208
Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?

1:18:53.625 --> 1:18:56.125
And what about you?

1:19:06.583 --> 1:19:08.208
Guelston is a place.

1:19:08.291 --> 1:19:09.875
It ain't a family.

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:14.625
I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:17.166
So all you have is me.

1:19:18.541 --> 1:19:20.125
And all I have is you.

1:19:21.291 --> 1:19:22.958
And that don't sound so bad.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.166
So, what do you say?

1:19:33.708 --> 1:19:34.875
Should we give it a go?

1:19:36.666 --> 1:19:37.541
You mean, uh…

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:39.791
You mean, like a family?

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:41.500
Sure.

1:19:42.416 --> 1:19:43.458
I-I don't know.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:49.666
Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:55.416
Never mind. It's stupid.

1:19:56.458 --> 1:19:58.875
What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?

1:19:58.958 --> 1:20:00.916
I said "never mind," ya donkey.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:02.708
So never mind.

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:05.750
It's just I-I don't think I'm--

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:07.750
You got something in your ears?

1:20:07.833 --> 1:20:09.208
All right, all right.

1:20:15.333 --> 1:20:18.708
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.

1:20:38.541 --> 1:20:42.041
Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.

1:20:42.791 --> 1:20:45.291
And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,

1:20:46.625 --> 1:20:47.958
it's time to go home now.

1:20:58.250 --> 1:21:02.416
And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:05.916
No more monster hunting!

1:21:16.125 --> 1:21:16.958
Hang about.

1:21:18.333 --> 1:21:19.500
Okay.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:21.458
No more!

1:21:25.458 --> 1:21:26.916
No more!

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.125
Ow!

1:21:28.625 --> 1:21:29.458
Jeez!

1:21:30.875 --> 1:21:35.125
Look, you understand
the point I'm trying to make here, right?

1:21:35.208 --> 1:21:36.833
It's a… It's a symbolic gesture.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:42.875
-I think she understands.

1:21:54.083 --> 1:21:55.208
All right, then.

1:21:55.916 --> 1:21:56.958
Time to go home.

1:22:22.125 --> 1:22:24.291
Go on, girl. Go home.

1:22:34.041 --> 1:22:34.875
Red?

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:38.708
Red!

1:22:45.291 --> 1:22:47.083
Oh no.

1:22:57.041 --> 1:22:58.416
Need a hand here.

1:23:00.666 --> 1:23:02.500
Red, listen to me.

1:23:02.583 --> 1:23:04.000
Just leave.

1:23:04.083 --> 1:23:05.750
This doesn't have to be a fight.

1:23:12.291 --> 1:23:14.041
-No, Red. Go.

1:23:14.125 --> 1:23:18.250
-Go on, Red. Just leave them be.
-Red, we have to go. Please!

1:23:30.666 --> 1:23:32.416
No, Red! No!

1:23:37.291 --> 1:23:39.541
All hands, to arms!

1:23:39.625 --> 1:23:41.041
Fire away!

1:23:48.541 --> 1:23:49.500
Maisie!

1:23:52.708 --> 1:23:54.000
No, Red! Stop!

1:23:54.625 --> 1:23:55.916
Maisie!

1:24:07.958 --> 1:24:08.958
Maisie!

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.791
Are you all right, lass?

1:24:12.833 --> 1:24:14.541
Is Red okay?

1:24:17.625 --> 1:24:18.791
Hold fast!

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:18.000
Stay back, beast. Leave her be.

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:36.250
It's the Red Bluster.

1:25:36.916 --> 1:25:38.250
The beast is delivered!

1:25:48.625 --> 1:25:49.625
No, lass.

1:25:50.875 --> 1:25:52.500
There's nothing to be done.

1:25:53.333 --> 1:25:55.166
She doesn't have to do this.

1:25:59.375 --> 1:26:01.583
Yes, she does.

1:26:13.833 --> 1:26:15.375
Ready the Hand of God!

1:26:42.833 --> 1:26:44.416
Now is the reckoning.

1:26:46.916 --> 1:26:49.791
For all who've been lost,

1:26:49.875 --> 1:26:52.666
I strike at thee, devil!

1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:32.375
Don't fight.

1:27:32.958 --> 1:27:35.083
You'll make the poison flow faster.

1:27:35.583 --> 1:27:38.708
I don't want you to die. Not yet.

1:27:38.791 --> 1:27:42.541
Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.

1:27:49.833 --> 1:27:53.750
Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.

1:27:53.833 --> 1:27:54.791
No, Sarah.

1:27:55.416 --> 1:27:57.541
I made a promise to the king and queen.

1:28:16.083 --> 1:28:17.166
But I'd not worry.

1:28:17.708 --> 1:28:19.541
There's no fight left in it.

1:28:23.416 --> 1:28:24.958
Yes, there is.

1:28:31.708 --> 1:28:33.791
Raise the studding sails!

1:28:33.875 --> 1:28:36.208
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:38.041
Hold!

1:28:44.208 --> 1:28:45.416
By the powers…

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:46.833
Jacob.

1:29:24.083 --> 1:29:25.166
I see.

1:29:26.041 --> 1:29:27.666
That's quite a story, Jacob.

1:29:29.125 --> 1:29:32.166
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.

1:29:34.125 --> 1:29:36.250
The beast what took me deadlight.

1:29:37.416 --> 1:29:39.041
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?

1:29:40.250 --> 1:29:42.708
That thing and I,

1:29:43.458 --> 1:29:44.583
we, uh, had, uh,

1:29:46.541 --> 1:29:47.708
an understanding.

1:29:47.791 --> 1:29:49.458
A truce. Hmm?

1:29:50.458 --> 1:29:52.791
But there cannot be a truce without war.

1:29:53.291 --> 1:29:59.375
Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.

1:30:02.833 --> 1:30:04.541
I've always known what I was, Jacob.

1:30:04.625 --> 1:30:07.541
I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.

1:30:07.625 --> 1:30:12.083
And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.

1:30:12.166 --> 1:30:17.458
That we may be tested
and find our greatness.

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.000
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,

1:30:21.833 --> 1:30:24.333
are you my enemy?

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:32.291
-Maisie, stop!

1:30:35.083 --> 1:30:36.416
Let her go!

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:41.083
She's all vinegar.

1:30:45.583 --> 1:30:48.458
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.

1:30:51.583 --> 1:30:53.791
You need to help Red.

1:30:53.875 --> 1:30:55.666
She's our friend.

1:30:56.541 --> 1:30:57.791
I'm sorry.

1:31:00.041 --> 1:31:01.250
She needs her rest.

1:31:01.916 --> 1:31:03.416
I'll get you back to Guelston.

1:31:05.041 --> 1:31:06.000
You'll be safe.

1:31:06.583 --> 1:31:09.125
You'll have a good, long life.

1:31:10.541 --> 1:31:13.208
But first, we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.

1:31:13.916 --> 1:31:16.000
We have a date with the king and queen.

1:31:17.875 --> 1:31:19.875
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.

1:31:34.875 --> 1:31:36.333
Welcome home, lad.

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.000
Good to see ya.

1:31:38.791 --> 1:31:39.875
So good to see you.

1:31:48.500 --> 1:31:49.958
You're home, Jacob.

1:31:50.041 --> 1:31:53.458
Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,

1:31:53.541 --> 1:31:55.791
as captain of the Inevitable.

1:32:19.458 --> 1:32:21.125
You're getting your strength back.

1:32:22.208 --> 1:32:23.125
Too late.

1:32:24.583 --> 1:32:25.416
Maybe.

1:32:27.583 --> 1:32:29.916
It's not right what they're doing to Red.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:31.458
She saved us.

1:32:31.541 --> 1:32:34.375
You have to believe me, please.

1:32:36.958 --> 1:32:37.916
I believe you.

1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:40.291
Then help me stop them.

1:32:41.666 --> 1:32:45.375
I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,

1:32:45.458 --> 1:32:49.166
and I've seen things
that will never go away.

1:32:50.208 --> 1:32:52.041
This ship is all I know.

1:32:54.375 --> 1:32:58.458
No first mate
more loyal than Sarah Sharpe.

1:33:17.500 --> 1:33:19.791
Crow's done it! He got the Bluster!

1:33:44.458 --> 1:33:47.250
The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.

1:33:47.875 --> 1:33:51.416
This ship, your ship, will live on.

1:33:52.416 --> 1:33:54.000
Nothing can stop it.

1:34:19.750 --> 1:34:21.583
Let's see a cat do that.

1:34:21.666 --> 1:34:23.041
Open the gate!

1:34:53.375 --> 1:34:54.791
It was them!

1:35:04.125 --> 1:35:05.083
Oh, girl.

1:35:16.416 --> 1:35:19.000
Don't worry, Red.
I-I'll get you out of here.

1:35:46.708 --> 1:35:47.958
What is all this?

1:35:48.041 --> 1:35:50.416
Why is everyone…

1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:59.291
He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!

1:36:03.416 --> 1:36:06.041
-That'll do, Ms. Merino.
-You heard the captain.

1:36:06.125 --> 1:36:07.125
Drop anchor.

1:36:21.666 --> 1:36:23.666
Captain Crow.

1:36:23.750 --> 1:36:28.208
Well, it looks like we have our winner.

1:36:28.291 --> 1:36:30.750
When I last visited Whiterock,

1:36:30.833 --> 1:36:35.791
you told me
that the days of hunters were over.

1:36:35.875 --> 1:36:39.666
But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.

1:36:50.375 --> 1:36:53.041
All of your wealth and power,

1:36:53.125 --> 1:36:58.916
all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.

1:37:04.125 --> 1:37:07.291
And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way

1:37:08.333 --> 1:37:10.875
into the Dregmorr and beyond.

1:37:13.041 --> 1:37:17.291
Until the bones
of every one of them beasts

1:37:17.375 --> 1:37:19.500
lies at the bottom of the sea!

1:37:22.333 --> 1:37:23.166
Captain!

1:37:29.583 --> 1:37:30.500
Jacob,

1:37:31.500 --> 1:37:32.708
get back on the ship.

1:37:33.625 --> 1:37:34.833
I can't let you do it.

1:37:36.833 --> 1:37:38.208
You dishonor me, boy.

1:37:38.958 --> 1:37:41.916
As you dishonor all them hunters
what come before.

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.625
All them what died heroes.

1:37:45.208 --> 1:37:47.333
Aye, they were heroes.

1:37:49.166 --> 1:37:50.416
But you can be a hero

1:37:51.250 --> 1:37:52.291
and still be wrong.

1:37:56.166 --> 1:37:58.291
Now give me the lance.

1:37:59.791 --> 1:38:01.583
I thought of you as a son.

1:38:02.625 --> 1:38:05.416
But I don't know you.

1:38:11.833 --> 1:38:13.125
I gave you everything!

1:38:14.583 --> 1:38:15.875
I gave you life!

1:38:18.541 --> 1:38:20.625
You've laid down your lance

1:38:20.708 --> 1:38:23.125
and think it's made you strong?

1:38:25.750 --> 1:38:28.416
But you've turned your back
on your own kind.

1:38:38.541 --> 1:38:39.875
-Jacob!

1:39:00.250 --> 1:39:02.416
I should have given you a bigger knife.

1:39:06.833 --> 1:39:08.958
-Oh!

1:39:11.833 --> 1:39:12.875
Whoa!

1:39:48.416 --> 1:39:52.083
The hunters brought the beast
to the very heart of our kingdom.

1:39:52.166 --> 1:39:54.666
For your queen, for all that is good,

1:39:54.750 --> 1:39:56.083
strike it down!

1:39:56.166 --> 1:39:58.791
Cannoneers! Take position!

1:40:18.833 --> 1:40:21.125
Prepare to fire!

1:40:42.083 --> 1:40:43.833
Out of our way, you fools!

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.083
Stop!

1:41:32.375 --> 1:41:35.708
If you do this, it never ends.

1:42:00.958 --> 1:42:04.750
No more monster hunting!

1:42:21.416 --> 1:42:22.583
Impossible.

1:42:44.583 --> 1:42:45.958
You did good, kid.

1:42:47.333 --> 1:42:48.291
I ain't done.

1:43:03.833 --> 1:43:04.875
Our books,

1:43:06.208 --> 1:43:07.500
our history,

1:43:08.458 --> 1:43:09.416
is a lie.

1:43:12.541 --> 1:43:15.708
I don't believe the beasts
ever threatened our shores.

1:43:16.208 --> 1:43:17.958
It was just a story.

1:43:18.916 --> 1:43:21.041
A story told by them!

1:43:21.125 --> 1:43:22.500
-What?

1:43:27.416 --> 1:43:31.958
For generations,
they've taught us to hate the beasts

1:43:32.625 --> 1:43:35.750
and sent the hunters out to destroy them.

1:43:35.833 --> 1:43:39.958
And the beasts learned
to fear us and hate us,

1:43:40.041 --> 1:43:42.375
and they fought back!

1:43:42.458 --> 1:43:46.041
Who are you to malign
your king and queen with such falsehoods?

1:43:46.125 --> 1:43:47.958
You have no right to speak!

1:43:48.041 --> 1:43:50.041
I have every right!

1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:58.125
I come from a long line of hunters
that died your great death!

1:43:59.083 --> 1:44:01.791
Your kingdom was paid for
with their blood,

1:44:02.750 --> 1:44:03.833
and their blood!

1:44:03.916 --> 1:44:07.166
Enough! General, give the command.

1:44:10.625 --> 1:44:14.916
This war was started
by the kings and queens what come before.

1:44:15.416 --> 1:44:18.666
And with every lie, their empire grew.

1:44:19.625 --> 1:44:25.041
Now this lot stands on the same perch
and tells the same lies.

1:44:26.416 --> 1:44:27.708
For their greed.

1:44:28.916 --> 1:44:29.875
General!

1:44:34.458 --> 1:44:35.958
Let it end.

1:44:36.958 --> 1:44:38.750
Let it end!

1:44:41.958 --> 1:44:43.208
Listen to her!

1:44:44.916 --> 1:44:46.333
Let the beast go!

1:44:57.500 --> 1:44:59.541
Listen to the child!

1:45:04.791 --> 1:45:05.833
Now I'm done.

1:45:11.250 --> 1:45:12.208
All right, Red.

1:45:12.958 --> 1:45:13.916
We best go.

1:45:19.166 --> 1:45:20.666
What are you doing?

1:45:20.750 --> 1:45:21.625
Fire!

1:45:21.708 --> 1:45:23.750
Your queen demands it!

1:45:26.541 --> 1:45:30.083
General, shouldn't we fire?

1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:37.000
My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.

1:45:43.625 --> 1:45:46.291
And I want to know how this war started.

1:45:55.208 --> 1:45:56.708
That hurt, didn't it?

1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:59.750
You have no idea.

1:46:25.375 --> 1:46:27.333
Two lives were saved that day.

1:46:28.166 --> 1:46:30.333
One man and one beast.

1:46:31.041 --> 1:46:33.916
And with that, the world began to change.

1:46:36.333 --> 1:46:38.833
No ship would ever sail
the Dregmorr again.

1:46:39.833 --> 1:46:42.875
And the mysteries beyond
would remain undisturbed.

1:46:49.666 --> 1:46:51.833
I don't think
about it much though.

1:46:52.416 --> 1:46:57.750
Red is safe,
and I have everything I need right here.

1:47:09.791 --> 1:47:12.875
I'm going to live a great life.
