WEBVTT

00:46.880 --> 00:48.339
Hot enough for ya?

00:48.757 --> 00:51.593
Shut up, Bill.
You've said that three times.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.136
-

00:53.219 --> 00:54.554
-What the...
-Dang ol' dang.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.431


00:56.514 --> 00:58.850
Damn, you should've seen your faces.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.727
Very witty, Colonel.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.605
What brings you to our humble alley
this afternoon?

01:03.688 --> 01:06.691
Well, all the money I inherited
from Topsy's estate

01:06.775 --> 01:07.776
got me to thinking.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.527
Topsy's dead.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.531
I outlived my last friend.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.118
Dang, it makes a man feel invincible.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.997
Congratulations on once again
outrunning the reaper, sir.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.457
It gets better than that.

01:22.540 --> 01:26.086
Topsy left me $10,000
to take care of his funeral.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.838
So after the cremation and ash bag,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.716
I'm still up 9,920.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.926
Well, that's great.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.221
You can finally get your Cadillac car back
from Lane Pratley,

01:36.304 --> 01:38.765
so you don't have to keep
taking the bus everywhere.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.727
Heck, I bet you'll have enough left over
to buy a certificate of deposit.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.396
Car payments? CDs?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.357
That ain't good enough for Topsy.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.068
I'm gonna use the money
to do what he would've done.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.654
Hell raising and girl chasing.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.656
And I'm gonna need someone to help me.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.784
Uh...

01:57.867 --> 01:58.701
-Fatty.
-Sir.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.912
-Ain't you in the Army?
-Sergeant Barber, sir.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.414
Fatty, you're my new friend.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.582
Congratulations.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.544
Really? Me? Thank you, sir.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.923
What are we gonna do first?
Should I change my shirt?

02:12.006 --> 02:13.716
Take my shirt off? Get a new shirt?

02:15.009 --> 02:19.013
So then Cotton says,
"I bet Fatty here can eat 50 potatoes,"

02:19.097 --> 02:21.141
and the bartender said, "No way."

02:21.224 --> 02:23.601
Which, of course, was a terrible insult
to the colonel's honor.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.938
Long story short,
I was pronounced legally dead.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.149
But it was a heck of a weekend.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.400
Yeah, it was a...

02:31.484 --> 02:33.570
What else you got to get into around here?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.363
Me and Topsy's money are getting bored.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.658
If you're looking for fun,
I've got a super long extension cord.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.452
We could see what it would be like
to make toast in the alley.

02:41.536 --> 02:45.081
Nope. Only thing that makes sense
is to head for the place

02:45.165 --> 02:48.418
where a man with American dollars
can live like a king,

02:48.501 --> 02:51.045
suckling on God's great teat.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.007
-Mexico.
-Margareetees and senoreetees.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.383
Amen, Fatty.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.343
What? No, no way.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.180
I got a brochure from a timeshare
in Mexico.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
It looks beautiful.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.516
You're gonna buy a timeshare?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.475
In Mexico?

03:04.559 --> 03:05.727
We don't have to buy.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.563
We can stay for free and all we have to do

03:08.646 --> 03:10.857
is listen to a 20-minute
information session.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.652
Perfect. We can save our money
for hookers and bribing Federales.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.697
Dad, we have good relations
with Mexico right now,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.616
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize that.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.327
Especially when you should be doing
something useful with that money.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.579
Don't worry, Hank. I'll be with him.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.957
Bill, these timeshare people
will clean you out.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.794
Now, I'll okay making toast in the alley
but you two aren't going anywhere.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.423
You can't control your wife
and she's only half the man I am.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.592
Fatty, pack your most colorful pants.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.302
We're going to Mexico.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.803
Whee!

03:42.847 --> 03:45.141
It's so hot.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.518
This corn is practically cooking.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.689
Now, Bobby, the more you complain
about the heat, the hotter it feels.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.983
I'm worried about my dad.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.110
I'm gonna have to go down
to that timeshare with him,

03:56.194 --> 03:58.279
make sure he doesn't do something crazy.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.281
Plus, I'll be baby-sitting Bill.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.660
His wages are still being garnished
by Columbia House.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.745
A timeshare is the last thing he needs.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.330
You be careful, too, Hank.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.917
You're going down there with a liver,
two kidneys and no timeshare.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.169
I expect you to come back the same way.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.839
Well, if an at-risk kid
can't get me to order <i>Sports Illustrated,</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:18.758
no one's gonna sell me a timeshare.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.804
Oh, God, why won't the sun go down?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.060
Gadbirk, you drive slow, boy.

04:29.143 --> 04:32.355
A Mexican speed limit
is still a speed limit, Dad.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.109
Hey, Fatty, I got a game
that'll help pass the time.

04:36.192 --> 04:40.321
Who do you think is uglier,
Hank's mother or Hank's wife?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.117
Here it comes, Bobby.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.037
Hi, Peggy.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.789
You're sweating like a pig.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.835
Dale, if you block my sprinkle turn,
I will take you down.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.630
That's for amateurs.
I'm stalking the big gallonage.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.349
Hank's wife or C. Everett Coop?

05:08.933 --> 05:09.976
Take your time.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.854
Wow. This is pretty nice.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.105
Welcome.

05:14.605 --> 05:15.690
Welcome.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.358
Or as we say in El Grande Vista,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.777
<i>Bien-ven-i-do.</i>

05:19.861 --> 05:23.781
Look, uh, Rich, I just want to be honest
so there are no hard feelings.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.201
We're not interested in buying.
Especially Bill.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.745
I appreciate that.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.248
But it's my job to make sure
everyone hears our dumb little shpeil.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.666
After that,

05:33.750 --> 05:36.878
we can start your free
world-class vacation.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.051
Ohh... Do they make swim diapers
in my size?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.845
Because I don't ever want to get out.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.724
Look, Peggy, I can do
a one-handed hand stand.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.397
See?

06:00.109 --> 06:02.862
This house is in truly
move-in condition.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.539
They're gonna take our pool away.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.500
I can't go back to the lawn.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.294
You, find us another pool.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.257
This is O'Kelly.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.009
Our founder.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.844
-Wow.
-Hoo!

06:28.012 --> 06:29.931
O'Kelly has incredible gifts.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.101
We're lucky he used them
to build the world's finest timeshares.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.228
It's strange.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.730
I fear him, but I am not afraid.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.488
All right, I got three up. Wendy?

06:45.571 --> 06:49.450
I know. I've got the bald, fat guy
who's gonna look down my shirt.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.035
Mitch, you take grandpa.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.454
And then, there's, uh,
Mr. Consumer Reports.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.874
Leave it to me.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.382
I just hope I'm good enough.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.305
You seem like the kind of man
who'd really enjoy O'Kelly's company.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.392
-He's an adventurer, explorer...
-Yeah, yeah,

07:14.475 --> 07:18.229
smells like strawberries,
pees ginger beer. Don't care.

07:18.312 --> 07:22.692
I know how you feel, Mr. Hill.
Afraid to take a chance.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.777
If you're like me,
your wife would tan your hide

07:24.861 --> 07:26.112
if you thought for yourself.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.947
Yep, that's why I'm not buying.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.950
I'm a big 'fraidy cat.
I'm barely even a man.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.619
My wife chases me around
with a rolling pin.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.538
It's got nothing to do with timeshares

07:35.621 --> 07:38.040
being one of the worst investments
there is.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.793
Bill, an attractive man like yourself...

07:40.877 --> 07:41.961
I'll buy.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.423
Congratulations. I think you'll find...

07:45.506 --> 07:48.134
Oh, it seems this card has been denied.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.469
I, I got other cards.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.762
Do you take Blockbuster?

07:52.847 --> 07:55.183
Oh, wait. I forgot about this baby.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.310
It has no credit limit.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.938
I hear you, Hank. But let me ask you this.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.983
How much do you spend
on an average vacation?

08:04.734 --> 08:05.693
Bill, no.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.325
I'm holding onto this,

08:12.408 --> 08:14.243
and I'm not letting you out of my sight.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.871
No one is buying a timeshare.

08:16.954 --> 08:20.082
Congratulations
on your new time share, Colonel.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.293
I'm in.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.259
O'Kelly sounds like

08:30.343 --> 08:33.346
he's got the smarts of Topsy,
the gumption of Brooklyn,

08:33.429 --> 08:35.097
and the moxie of Fat Brooklyn.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.893
He's like all my old dead friends
rolled into one big, live friend.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
-Yeah.
-Yes.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.812
-To Brooklyn.
-Absolutely.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.233
Look, I don't know anything
about this O'Kelly guy,

08:45.316 --> 08:47.985
but you were
in a sales-pressure-induced daze

08:48.069 --> 08:50.655
and they made you sign something
you didn't understand.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.865
-We'll get you out of this.
-I don't want out.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.202
Damn it, boy, quit acting like a doorjamb
and get onboard.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.287
Maybe you should think about it,
Colonel Hill.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.374
Our policy here is if you decide you don't
want to live life to the fullest,

09:01.457 --> 09:03.042
you got 12 hours to back out.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.044
In the meantime,
why don't you enjoy a bite

09:05.127 --> 09:06.629
at one of our world-class restaurants?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.965
Here are some owners' coupons
for 10 perfect off.

09:09.048 --> 09:09.966
You see that, boy?

09:10.049 --> 09:12.385
What do you get
with your precious AAA card?

09:12.468 --> 09:14.470
They don't even take those here.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.357
Isn't it beautiful?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.578
Last time I was here, they were puppies.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.330
Uh, now, which one of you is Scamp?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.002
That hair dryer, mine.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.422
Copy of <i>Leisure</i><i>Properties Monthly,</i> mine.

09:49.505 --> 09:54.093
Looky here, they got the water
that don't give you the hot poops. Swanky.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.970
Look, I admit, it's a great room,

09:56.053 --> 10:01.225
but I saw an ad that anyone can rent
the same O'Kelly suite for $35 a night.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.185
You're paying three times that.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.147
Come here, Hank.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.984
Do you know what's out there?

10:10.067 --> 10:13.571
O'Kelly's private yacht,
manned 24 hours a day

10:13.654 --> 10:15.823
by the creme de la crèème
of the Mexican navy.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.367
Got a private chef
used to work for Cantinflas.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.369
I don't see anything.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.747
That's 'cause you're looking
with renter's eyes.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.290
I think I see it.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.918
You get in good with O'Kelly,
you get on that yacht.

10:28.002 --> 10:32.131
That's the kind of lifestyle
you buy into here at El Grande Vista.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.924
But you're not really buying.

10:34.008 --> 10:39.180
It says in their own brochure,
"Americans cannot own land in Mexico."

10:39.263 --> 10:40.306
If I don't own anything,

10:40.389 --> 10:43.267
why am I paying all these maintenance fees
and property taxes?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.977
Good point.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.647
You've still got ten hours
to get out, Dad.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.608
I ain't getting out of anything.
I like it here.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.527
Fatty, let's go to the owner's pool.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.287
Just pour it in the snorkel.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.664
Pour it...

11:08.167 --> 11:10.086
Colonel, you're a world traveler,

11:10.169 --> 11:11.170
so I'm sure you appreciate

11:11.253 --> 11:13.673
the international details
O'Kelly insists on.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.258
Italianate marble, Mexican cacti.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.969
We're proud of saying
"It's the casa with class-a."

11:19.053 --> 11:21.806
Yeah, becoming an owner
was the best thing I did

11:21.889 --> 11:23.349
with the money I inherited.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.810
I should have brought
Topsy's ashes down here

11:25.893 --> 11:27.478
and spread them over a señorita.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.439
All right, all right.

11:30.523 --> 11:35.986
Rich, you're all right, all right,
but you know what I don't get?

11:36.070 --> 11:39.740
Hank was saying if you buy
a timeshare in Mexico,

11:39.824 --> 11:42.576
you can't even own it
'cause you're a foreigner.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.496
How can you buy something
that you can't own?

11:45.579 --> 11:46.956
Why, that's true.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.167
My son is a jackass and a killjoy,

11:50.251 --> 11:51.752
but that is a puzzler.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
Bill, why don't you get us
some chips and salsa?

11:53.921 --> 11:55.715
That I can do!

11:56.924 --> 11:58.467
So level with me, Rich.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.552
Is it true?

11:59.802 --> 12:02.138
'Cause I only got six hours
to make up my mind.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.473
Colonel, I wasn't supposed
to tell you this,

12:04.557 --> 12:05.808
because you're not an owner yet,

12:05.891 --> 12:08.561
but you've already been hand-picked
by O'Kelly

12:08.644 --> 12:10.855
to join his El Presidente Circle.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.442
It's an elite group of owners.
Very exclusive.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.861
You'd have a condo
on El Presidente Island.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.778
Oh.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.865
Use of O'Kelly's helicopter,
humidor privileges,

12:20.948 --> 12:22.450
Oh...

12:22.533 --> 12:25.953
You'll receive your own
El Presidente Medal of Achievement.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.165
It all happens aboard O'Kelly's yacht
tomorrow night.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.709
Assuming you decide to stay.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.085
Hand-picked, eh?

12:33.377 --> 12:36.130
Yeah, I could chew that over.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.715
Uh... Your friend.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.467
I don't know how to put this.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.802
O'Kelly's yacht may be big,

12:41.886 --> 12:44.889
but there's not always room on it
for everyone.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.557
-Fatty.
-Sir, yes, sir.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.559
I'm done with you. Get packin'.

12:48.642 --> 12:49.685
-Yeah, but...
-Sir.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.020
Please swim to the shallow end.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.524
Dad. Dad!

12:57.109 --> 12:58.736
Sir, please stop that.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.463
Bill?

13:17.546 --> 13:19.965
Your dad doesn't need me anymore.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.843
He dumped me for O'Kelly.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.179
Bill, I've only got a couple of hours

13:25.262 --> 13:26.931
to get my dad out of this deal,

13:27.014 --> 13:28.432
and I can't do it alone.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.683
I need you.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.031
Colonel, your <i>cabeza</i><i>es muy grande.</i>

13:46.659 --> 13:49.829
Hurry up, Bill.
They're measuring my dad for a sombrero.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.997
I'm almost through,
I'm almost through.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.499
I'm... Ow.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.000
There's the fence.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.586
Ah. Dang it, we'll never get to him
in time.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.213
He's gonna lose every penny.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.258
Maybe we should just give up
and let him enjoy himself.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.094
I mean, a month ago,
he didn't even have that money.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.262
No, this is important.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.180
I can't let him get ripped off.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.018
Beautiful, Colonel. Very authentic.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.981
I came down here to protect my dad
and damn it, that's what I'm gonna do.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.399
We've gotta get to Rich.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.818
Just look out for those guys
in the feathers.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.988
They worked me over pretty good
after they kicked me out of the pool.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.992
Leave this to me.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.952
I'll distract them.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.754
I mean, it's really vacation...

14:40.838 --> 14:45.718
I am going to go and eat
some of O'Kelly's penguins.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.559
Americans cannot own land in Mexico.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.395
Americans cannot own land in Mexico.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.939
Uhh.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.358
I'm sorry. He's not a member.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.201
Okay, you little weasel,

15:11.285 --> 15:13.954
I'm not letting you steal
any more of my Dad's money.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.874
Steal? Hank, your dad is an adult.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.002
He has a right to spend his own money
and this is how he wants to spend it.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.255
And I should tell you, with your father
a member of El Presidente,

15:23.339 --> 15:26.550
I think O'Kelly would look very favorably
on your application.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.177
But he doesn't even have anything.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.014
He lives in an apartment
and only gets $300 a month pension.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.058
He can't even afford real Cheerios.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.227
He eats something called Oat Loops.
It's made right around here.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.771
What? But then...

15:39.188 --> 15:41.231
how can we raise
his monthly ownership dues?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.900
And if he's not a homeowner, then...

15:42.983 --> 15:44.568
what are we gonna foreclose on?

15:44.985 --> 15:48.530
Fine. You want your dad out of this?
He's out.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.462
Dad? You there?

16:03.712 --> 16:05.464
I've got something to talk about with you.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.136
Which cufflinks do you think
O'Kelly would like more?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.930
The ones that look like bosoms?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.807
Or the ones that look like guns?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.058
Why're you all dressed up?

16:16.141 --> 16:19.395
You only become El Presidente once, boy.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.523
I want to look sharp tomorrow night
when I board O'Kelly's yacht

16:22.606 --> 16:28.404
and the great man himself hands me
my El Presidente Medal of Achievement.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.446
Uh...

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
that's why I came by. I, uh...

16:31.782 --> 16:32.992
I gotta admit, Hank.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.245
Since all my buddies kicked off,
things just ain't felt right,

16:36.912 --> 16:37.997
but now I gots me

16:38.080 --> 16:39.999
some place where I belong.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.210
Uh, yeah. We need to talk about that.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.545
Nothing to talk about.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.588
I was born. I lived.

16:46.672 --> 16:51.760
Then I got to be El Presidente
and that made it all worthwhile.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.771
I tried to help my dad,
and I've made everything worse.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.191
Meeting O'Kelly has become
his whole reason for living.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.528
I got hit in the head, Hank.
I can't hear too well.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.032
Is this butter or water?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.783
May I have your coupons, please?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.202
Uh, we don't have any coupons.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.621
Then... what are you doing here?

17:22.750 --> 17:26.920
He's gonna be devastated
when he can't get on that damn yacht.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.924
I'm not gonna let this happen.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.428
I'm going to the one place
that can get something done about it.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.433
Mr. Hill, I've had a lot of complaints
about timeshares,

17:39.516 --> 17:41.393
but they're pretty tough contracts
to get out of.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.645
No, I already got him out of his contract.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.900
The problem is my dad wants
to be an El Presidente-level member.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.320
Oh. And they won't let him in
because he's...

17:51.403 --> 17:52.654
Why won't they let him in?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.407
Because you can't be
an El Presidente member

17:55.491 --> 17:56.950
unless you buy a timeshare.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.370
So you want me to get your father
into El Presidente for free?

18:00.454 --> 18:01.830
Yeah, that would be great.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.791
I got it.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.877
Why don't we slap an embargo
on all of Mexico till Rich lets him in?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.338
You know, starve 'em out.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.423
I'm kidding, Mr. Hill.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.012
Well, hello there.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.807
We are your new next door neighbors.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.475
You're gonna love us.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.310
What happened to the Petersons?

18:23.393 --> 18:24.436
Unclear.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.897
So, what do you say,
how about a swim, neighbor?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.776
Neighbor?

18:31.026 --> 18:32.402
Neighbor?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.946
Neighbor!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.247
What do you mean, I ain't on the list?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.623
I'm sorry, Colonel.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.583
This is very awkward.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.670
Awkward? Awkward is me
slicing your belly open.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.171
Now, let me on that yacht.

18:51.713 --> 18:55.175
But I was hand-picked by O'Kelly.

18:55.926 --> 18:56.760
Oh.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.556
You just can't beat these guys, Hank.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.599
Yeah, well, I gotta find some way

19:02.683 --> 19:04.351
to get inside there.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.985
I'm off to urinate
on the statue of O'Kelly.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.374
Don't touch....

19:30.294 --> 19:31.378
Look, Rich,

19:31.461 --> 19:34.214
I know I asked you to let my dad
out of that timeshare,

19:34.298 --> 19:38.010
but I didn't realize how much
El Presidente meant to him.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.763
Can you just let him back in
so he can get on that boat tonight?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.765
I'd love to, Hank, but I don't know.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.267
There's a lot of paperwork to do,

19:45.350 --> 19:48.562
not to mention some pretty steep
express-processing fees.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.734
But maybe there is way
we could overlook all that.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.735
Yeah?

19:54.818 --> 19:59.198
If Cotton recommended someone who bought,
say, a week at El Grande Vista,

19:59.281 --> 20:01.116
maybe O'Kelly would reconsider him.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.911
Oh, God. Oh, no.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.830
Hank, how much do you spend
on a typical vacation?

20:08.332 --> 20:10.500
I can't thank you enough, Mr. Hill.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.419
I was about to lose my job.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.588
-And my wife...
-Save it, Jim. He's in the bag.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.423
Great. Sign here, here, and here.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.224
Yep.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.558
Yep.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.981
Hey, Dad. So, how was El Presidente?

20:33.273 --> 20:34.775
Did you get to meet O'Kelly?

20:34.858 --> 20:38.737
I wish I could tell you, boy,
but code of the El Presidente.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.531
What happens on that yacht,
stays on that yacht.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.576
Hey, Rich told me you were gonna buy
a week here at the Vista.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.662
Hell, that's great news.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.788
That's right, Dad.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.249
Well, I'll leave you two owners.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.543
Please accept these coupons
for soup and half a sandwich.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.965
Look how beautiful it is, boy.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.008
I told you I knew how to spend that money.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.178
Hell, Topsy couldn't have spent it better
himself.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.097
Uh, you're right about that, Dad.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.683
This was a great investment,
I tell you what.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.351
But, Hank, I thought you said

21:09.434 --> 21:12.354
Americans can't own land in Mexico...

21:12.437 --> 21:14.106
<i>A great investment.</i>

21:46.346 --> 21:48.932
<i>Just pour it in the snorkel. Pour it...</i>
