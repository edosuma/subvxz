00:01.376 --> 00:04.338
<i>New York City.
Ever heard of it?</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:05.797
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yeah ♪</i>

00:07.674 --> 00:08.717
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:10.135
<i>That's me walking.</i>

00:10.135 --> 00:12.262
<i>I'm Petey,
a girl with a boy's name,</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:13.805
<i>so you're allowed to like me.</i>

00:13.805 --> 00:16.099
<i>My days are filled
with typical New York stuff:</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:17.809
<i>getting a coffee
on my way to coffee,</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:20.729
<i>therapy, more therapy,
therapy again,</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:22.481
<i>jaywalking to a museum,</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:23.899
<i>avoiding the train piss bottle,</i>

00:23.899 --> 00:25.776
<i>looking relieved yet somber</i>

00:25.776 --> 00:27.903
<i>as a giant monster
is murdered,</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:29.738
<i>and, of course, Broadway.</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:31.990
<i>I had it all, the perfect job</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:34.159
<i>as a senior assistant
editorial assistant</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:36.870
<i>at the biggest
fashion magazine in Midtown.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:38.914
Mm, good clothes, bad clothes,
good clothes, bad clothes.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.499
Well, time for lunch.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.543
<i>Sure, I'd been an assistant
for eight years,</i>

00:42.543 --> 00:44.294
<i>but they let me take home
the stale bagels</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:46.296
<i>at the end of the day.
Girl boss!</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.299
We need to pick a page.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.551
If only we knew which was
going to be in this month,

00:51.551 --> 00:54.137
shirt or pants.
Any ideas?

00:54.137 --> 00:57.474
- Shirt covers the top!
- Pants cover the bottom!

00:57.474 --> 00:58.809
Jumpsuit covers both.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.814
What, me?
I didn't say anything.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.316
Ugh.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.651
<i>Sure,
I've spent my whole life</i>

01:07.651 --> 01:09.194
<i>terrified of speaking up</i>

01:09.194 --> 01:11.154
<i>because of a complete lack
of sense of self,</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:12.781
<i>but who knows?</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:14.700
<i>Maybe that's what landed me
the perfect fiancé.</i>

01:14.700 --> 01:17.411
<i>He was the best man New York
had to offer.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:21.039
God, you make sense on paper.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.585
Oh, my God, Brian, not here.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.545
God.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.714
<i>I guess you could
say I had it all:</i>

01:28.714 --> 01:31.174
<i>a man, a job,
and an apartment.</i>

01:31.174 --> 01:33.218
<i>Wait, that's three things.</i>

01:33.218 --> 01:35.971
<i>I guess you could say
I had three things,</i>

01:35.971 --> 01:39.141
<i>and none of them will ever
completely fall apart.</i>

01:57.659 --> 01:59.369
<i>My whole life was perfect,</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:01.538
<i>but none of it was ever enough
for my socialite mother,</i>

02:01.538 --> 02:02.789
<i>White St. Barts.</i>

02:02.789 --> 02:04.583
<i>She runs a charity
for unwed dogs.</i>

02:04.583 --> 02:07.711
<i>Ms. St. Barts, your daughter
is here to see you.</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:09.296
What on earth is a daughter?

02:09.296 --> 02:11.423
<i>It's like a son but a girl.</i>

02:11.423 --> 02:13.175
This generation
has a word for everything.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.718
I can't keep up.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.219
Hi, Mother.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.055
I brought you an expensive
yet meaningful pastry

02:18.055 --> 02:19.306
from the bakery
we used to go to

02:19.306 --> 02:20.474
when I was little.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.808
How thoughtful.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.393
Now, what is it
you want from me,

02:23.393 --> 02:24.728
money, a lawyer?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.188
If it's an apology
you're after,

02:26.188 --> 02:28.023
I'd prefer
to just write a check.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.734
- You called me, Mother.
- Right, of course.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.319
I called you here
because there's a wedding

02:32.319 --> 02:34.988
I have to go to next month
that I'm absolutely dreading.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.491
- Oh, Mother, that's--
- I know, I know.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.534
Why not just send a cold gift
with my regrets?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.619
Mother.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.079
The only reason I'm going

02:42.079 --> 02:43.872
is that I'm the mother
of the bride.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.749
Oh, right, that's you.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.377
Um, here.
- What's this?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.961
I wanted to pretend
I had a gift,

02:49.961 --> 02:53.173
but it's actually the VHS tape
I've been hiding from you.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.385
Honestly, it's the worst thing
I could have possibly grabbed.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.553
Well, now
that you're holding it,

02:58.553 --> 02:59.513
it's a message
from your father.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.014
I have a father?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.933
Well, not anymore.
He's dead.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.103
- I have a dead father?
- I'll get my checkbook.

03:08.313 --> 03:12.109
<i>Dearest, sweetest,
loveliest Petra,</i>

03:12.109 --> 03:14.152
<i>It's me, your father!</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:16.905
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry
I wasn't around much</i>

03:16.905 --> 03:18.490
when you were growing up,
you know,

03:18.490 --> 03:23.495
but I was busy working
on something so cool,

03:23.495 --> 03:25.664
and if you're watching this,
that means two things:

03:25.664 --> 03:29.709
I'm dead, and now
that cool thing is all yours.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.171
The community of New Utopia...

03:33.171 --> 03:34.589
West Carolina.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.511
Wow, what a nice town I made.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.012
Go get it.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.347
There you go.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.058
Now, I know you're a city girl.
I do.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.687
I was a city boy myself.
We have that in common.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.607
Yeah, there's only one problem,
I'm not a city boy anymore.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.526
I'm a country old man.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.322
Okay, now once you grow up,

03:59.322 --> 04:02.951
I'm sure you'll be
a decisive, opinionated,

04:02.951 --> 04:06.830
brave, confident leader
just like your daddy,

04:06.830 --> 04:09.166
and once I'm gone,
the only person

04:09.166 --> 04:12.043
who can keep this place going
is you

04:12.043 --> 04:16.173
because you're the only me
that's younger.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.716
<i>Does it--does that make sense?</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:20.844
Does it make sense?

04:20.844 --> 04:23.096
We need fresh blood
around here.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.557
We love you, Petey!

04:25.557 --> 04:28.435
<i>Yeah, look at them!
They love you!</i>

04:31.021 --> 04:32.647
Whoa.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.609
Security, there's some
random woman in my office.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.611
<i>Tonight on
"Hot People Over-Sharing</i>

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
<i>Their Trauma
and Then Kissing"...</i>

04:39.780 --> 04:41.615
<i>My mom got really sick.</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:43.366
<i>My dad exploded.</i>

04:45.368 --> 04:47.329
Wow, a whole town
or whatever?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.372
That's a dope inheritance.
Are you gonna take it?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.582
No way.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.542
What about my job,
my apartment?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.294
And what about Brian?
He can't leave now.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.670
He just got a big raise.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.758
Well, what if you went out
for a little bit?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.176
Just to test it out.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.135
You could get to know
about your dad

05:02.135 --> 05:04.304
and touch a cow.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.431
I mean, maybe you'll like
living in the country

05:06.431 --> 05:08.099
and not getting married
to Brian.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.684
Wait a minute.
What's on your lip?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.019
That?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.230
It's--oh.
- Oh, my God.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.565
A splinter?
That means...

05:15.565 --> 05:17.818
Oh, God.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.071
Brian? With my best friend?

05:21.071 --> 05:23.573
- It's not what it looks like.
- This cannot be happening.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.283
You know there's no good guys
in New York.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.410
I mean, what woman
could say no to him?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.955
I am done with both of you.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.544
My female boss.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.045
We just got the numbers

05:37.045 --> 05:38.797
from the magazine
we published today.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
The one on shirt?

05:40.090 --> 05:41.424
They're the worst
we've ever had.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.385
Turns out the answer
was jumpsuit.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.761
Ugh, but I said that.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.638
No, you whispered it
under your breath,

05:46.638 --> 05:51.142
then called yourself dumb,
then you did a little shimmy.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.270
Oof, did I say
the dumb part out loud?

05:53.270 --> 05:56.189
I'm dumb.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.399
I'm sorry, Petey.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.150
We have a zero-tolerance policy

05:59.150 --> 06:01.194
for women
calling themselves dumb.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.320
You're fired.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.656
No!

06:05.824 --> 06:07.617
My apartment!

06:07.617 --> 06:09.911
Sorry, I knocked over
every candle.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.288
Ugh.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.331
Wait, Petey, stop.
Where are you going?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.499
Taxi!

06:14.499 --> 06:16.334
Taxi to the South!

06:18.169 --> 06:19.629
<i>I was feeling really sad</i>

06:19.629 --> 06:21.298
<i>after my whole life
literally burned down.</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:23.174
<i>I just needed to lay low
for a while</i>

06:23.174 --> 06:26.011
<i>and figure out my next move
in my dead dad's weird town.</i>

06:28.138 --> 06:30.223
Ugh.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.561
Ugh, no service.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.105
This is not New York.
Oh!

06:38.356 --> 06:39.900
Uh, I'm walking here.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.819
Oh, ugh.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.658
No, not my tiny shoe.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.043
Hello, hot redneck.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.753
Hello, hot redneck?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.796
- Name's Bandit.
- Could you help me?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.966
I'm stuck in this--
this brown cement.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.551
I'll save you
from that there mud--

07:06.551 --> 07:08.720
it's called mud--
on one condition.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.096
Uh, okay.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.349
- You turn tail and get.
- I what?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.851
You take that caboose
and vamoose.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.229
A moose and "jaboose."
What?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.524
I'm saying you better go back
where you came from.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.652
You are being so mean
for no reason.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.111
Don't you know who I am?

07:25.111 --> 07:29.199
You are Petey St. Barts,
and I will die on my feet

07:29.199 --> 07:32.035
like a horse
before I let you ruin that town

07:32.035 --> 07:33.536
like your daddy did.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.789
Excuse me, rude hunk,

07:35.789 --> 07:38.291
I can do whatever I want
with that town

07:38.291 --> 07:40.543
because my dad gave it to me
in a video,

07:40.543 --> 07:43.588
and I am not gonna let
some uneducated,

07:43.588 --> 07:47.592
square state, backwoods nobody
push me around.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.929
Wowie, all right then.
Suit yourself.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.555
But you should know,

07:52.555 --> 07:54.599
your town has
a little gator problem.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.893
Oh, God.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.522
Please help me.
- Hey, it's your town.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.856
You figure it out.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.529
Okay, fine,
I'll leave on the next bus.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.531
Just help me.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.574
Shake on it?
- Ugh, fine.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
Just make it quick
and not on my hair.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.203
Oh, no,
not what I was going for.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.163
Ah!
Oh.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.331
Gary.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.875
Go get it, Gary!

08:21.793 --> 08:23.545
Mm.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.047
Thank you, but as I learned
in my many years

08:26.047 --> 08:28.174
as a senior assistant
editorial assistant,

08:28.174 --> 08:30.593
that contract is not binding
because I didn't open it

08:30.593 --> 08:32.303
on my phone,
agree to terms and conditions

08:32.303 --> 08:33.805
I never read,
and then press okay

08:33.805 --> 08:35.890
to a signature that looks
nothing like mine.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.768
But we spit shook.
You snake!

08:38.768 --> 08:40.603
Can you help me
get a ride to my town?

08:40.603 --> 08:41.938
Help you?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.398
I wouldn't help you
with a ten-foot pole.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.526
But I'm a Southern gentleman,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.361
so I can't just leave you
out here all alone.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.196
So what do we do?

08:51.322 --> 08:53.324
Ugh, oh.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.201
Ugh.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.495
Will you at least tell me
why you hate me?

08:57.495 --> 09:00.415
Hydrangea,
you hear something?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.836
What--what?
Oh, oh, my God.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.504
Oh, my God.
Oh!

09:18.391 --> 09:20.894
And honestly, New Yorkers
never talk to our neighbors,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.312
so you won't even know
I'm here.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.939
I'm thinking they already do.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.864
Wow, talk about
Southern hospitality.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.199
Right, Bandit?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.241
Ugh.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.041
Uh...
Hi, I'm--

09:43.041 --> 09:45.835
The spitting image
of your daddy.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
Welcome to the New Utopia Inn.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.006
Mm.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.884
I've been waiting on you
for so long.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.221
This day--oh, this day.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.432
Um, so who are you?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.017
I'm Mae Mae.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.937
I was your father's right hand
until the day he died.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.563
His right hand, perfect.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.315
So you'll be able to answer
all my questions.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.861
This town has no questions,
only answers.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.404
That was not an answer.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.657
Oh, look at your broken heel.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.909
Let's get that fixed up.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.621
Emmett, will you take good,
long care of this shoe?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.624
I take good, long care
of every shoe.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.335
- Emmett, neutral statement.
- Ugh!

10:27.335 --> 10:28.920
Let's get you
to your father's room

10:28.920 --> 10:30.505
so you can take a shower.
- God, yes.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.424
I would love a shower.

10:33.424 --> 10:38.471
- ♪ Ha, da, doo, da ♪
- Oh, ah, that's so nice.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.516
Thank you, thank you.
- ♪ Nah, nah, nay ♪

10:41.516 --> 10:43.059
Not the weirdest shower
I've ever had.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.228
Ooh.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.064
It's so fun
having a leader back

10:48.064 --> 10:49.941
'Cause I help the leader.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.111
Anything I can ever do for you,
you just holler.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.197
And I mean anything.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.283
Honestly,
this day has been a lot.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.076
I could use a drink
in a fun way,

11:00.076 --> 11:02.579
not in any other way.
- We have drink!

11:04.372 --> 11:05.748
Ooh.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.917
Welcome to the Filthy Pecker.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.003
Over there is the jukebox,

11:10.003 --> 11:12.839
and back there is where
men punch fight to music.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.593
Up there's Big Judy,
and right there's Eliza,

11:16.593 --> 11:19.179
proprietress of
this fine establishment.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.597
Hey!

11:20.597 --> 11:22.390
She'll make you
the finest pickleback

11:22.390 --> 11:24.058
this side
of the Chattahoochee.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.436
Thank you.
What was your name again?

11:26.436 --> 11:30.190
- I'm working actor Alan Tudyk.
- Who?

11:30.190 --> 11:33.484
I'm the chicken in "Moana."

11:33.484 --> 11:36.029
Cool.
What are you doing out here?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.156
I took a workshop
out here once.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.949
Really fell in love
with the place.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.368
All it needs
is some fresh blood.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.746
Young people, alcohol,

11:44.746 --> 11:46.998
a random
slightly famous person.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.708
These are all the signs
of a good party.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.836
Wait, is this place fun?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.254
Ooh.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.131
I thought I told you to get.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.343
So you're mean to me
but nice to old ladies.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.220
Random.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.971
Is your body
wearing a necklace?

12:01.971 --> 12:05.099
Oh, it's a belly chain,
a timeless fashion.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.852
That's kinda--
I--I've never seen that.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.647
It looks... bail.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.232
Okay.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.028
What is it about a hot guy

12:17.028 --> 12:20.573
being nice to an old lady
that is so [bleep] hot?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.742
Yeah, good.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.662
Eh, maybe I'm just horny
and upset because my ex-fiancé

12:25.662 --> 12:27.330
cheated on me
with my best friend.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.290
Weird instant overshare.
I like it.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.042
I'm Eliza.
- I'm Petey.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.044
And I am loving your bar.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.088
It's almost good enough
to be in NYC.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.757
Thanks, I poured my heart
and soul into this place

12:37.757 --> 12:41.094
ever since my last relationship
ended a year ago.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.888
Oh, my God, I'm just out
of a relationship too.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.432
We have so much in common.
Let me guess.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.477
Another woman?
- Uh, yeah, you could say that.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.982
It just feels like
my whole life,

12:53.982 --> 12:56.025
every decision was made for me,

12:56.025 --> 12:58.278
either by the culture
or some older person

12:58.278 --> 13:00.863
who's in charge of me.
- Same here.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.367
Ugh, listen to us sharing our
heartbreaks on first meeting.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.577
We sound like an episode
of "Hot People Over-Sharing...

13:06.577 --> 13:07.537
"Their Traumas

13:07.537 --> 13:08.788
and Then Kissing"!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.206
- You watch that show?
- Oh, my God.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.750
I never miss it.
- You feel this, right?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.169
- Your ice-cold grip?
- Our friendship spark.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.630
We're gonna be best friends.
I can tell.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.925
I do feel it, but are we
getting too close too fast?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.427
Um, probably not.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.304
Look, my whole thing
with coming out here

13:24.304 --> 13:26.973
is to bring this town into
20-whatever year it is.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.308
Is there anything
I should know?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.436
Listen, a lot of people
around here

13:31.436 --> 13:33.229
will be fake with you
because of who your dad was.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.689
Not me.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.899
If you need someone to talk to
who's normal,

13:36.899 --> 13:39.485
come find me, and if anyone
tells you they're normal,

13:39.485 --> 13:40.653
don't trust them.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.658
What is this?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.035
That there is pool darts.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.619
Simplest game on the books,

13:48.619 --> 13:50.288
unless you're city folk,
of course.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.999
Uh, I was an assistant
at "Money Girl" magazine,

13:52.999 --> 13:55.877
so I'm pretty sure
I could figure it out.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.879
- Want to bet?
- Name your terms.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.214
If I win,
you have to leave town.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.425
And if I win,
you have to kiss me.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.385
Deal.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.640
<i>♪ What are you
waiting for? ♪</i>

14:09.640 --> 14:12.852
<i>♪ Oh, come on,
what are you waiting for? ♪</i>

14:18.399 --> 14:20.860
Beginner's luck.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.445
Pay up, loser.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.490
<i>♪ What are you

14:25.490 --> 14:29.243
<i>♪ 'Cause you got everything

14:29.243 --> 14:31.871

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
<i>♪ Oh, come on,
what are you waiting for? ♪</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
Get it!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.294
- Why are we clapping?
- Because they're kissing.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.213
Come on.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.465
- I can't do this.
- Why not?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.467
Because your dad ran a cult.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.677
What?
No, he didn't.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.847
I grew up with your dad,
and it was hell.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.975
Once he died, I thought it was
safe to come back and rebuild.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.061
You being here ruins all that.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.562
Well, I can make it better.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.189
You being here
means the prophecy

14:58.189 --> 15:00.399
of the great daughter's return
is fulfilled.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.110
That's why
I wanted you to leave.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.362
I thought you were being mean
to me because you liked me.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.657
- Who would do that?
- This is not a cult.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.325
It just needs
a little fresh blood.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.119
Oh, yes!

15:11.119 --> 15:12.453
Oh, here we go.
Thank you.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.830
Ooh, it's cold.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.749
Fresh blood, fresh blood.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.584
Fresh blood...
- Ooh, looks sharp.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.466
What the [bleep]?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.594
This is what a feminist
dies like.

15:33.724 --> 15:34.976
Sweetie, what's wrong?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.811
They killed Alan Tudyk.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.521
He's good in everything.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.024
He's like a boy Judy Greer,
and they killed him

15:42.024 --> 15:44.569
for me.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.113
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.656
I guess I should have
warned you better.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.158
It was your father's teaching

15:50.158 --> 15:52.326
that, on the night of
the great daughter's return,

15:52.326 --> 15:55.079
we kill a character actor.
It's tradition.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.915
You people are [bleep] crazy.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.418
Give me my shoes.
I need to leave.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.462
Sorry, your shoes
aren't ready yet.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.048
Even the shoe guy was fake?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.968
Taxi!
Taxi!

16:10.052 --> 16:13.014
What is wrong with my hand?

16:13.014 --> 16:15.057
Please, Petra,
you can't leave.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.018
We need you here
so the comet will return.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.312
Oh, God, it's a space cult?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.354
Ugh, of course.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.106
Boomers love space.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.026
Emmett, the emergency
combination TV/VCR!

16:25.026 --> 16:27.236
Uh, what is this?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.155
Your father will explain.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.324
<i>If you're watching
this tape,</i>

16:31.324 --> 16:33.618
<i>it means you've gotten
a little spooked</i>

16:33.618 --> 16:36.871
<i>after witnessing
your first human sacrifice.</i>

16:36.871 --> 16:39.248
Hell, I wouldn't blame you
for running for the hills,

16:39.248 --> 16:42.501
but you're still here.
Why is that?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.671
Maybe it's because your shoe
is still in the shop,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.549
or maybe, just maybe,

16:48.549 --> 16:51.135
it's because,
despite the unfamiliar,

16:51.135 --> 16:53.679
bizarre, and occasionally
horrifying sights

16:53.679 --> 16:55.723
you've seen today,
you can't help

16:55.723 --> 16:58.267
but feel connected
to this place.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.937
I'm trusting you with it, Petey.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.189
Whatever you want
to be different,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.607
you can change.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.985
New Utopia needs you,
and deep down,

17:07.985 --> 17:11.572
<i>I think you need
New Utopia too.</i>

17:11.572 --> 17:13.991
P.S.,
who got sacrificed tonight?

17:13.991 --> 17:17.078
Who was it?
I love show business gossip.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.788
Was it Helen Hunt?
Was it?

17:18.788 --> 17:21.707
God, she'd be
such a great get!

17:22.875 --> 17:25.878
Well, Petey, will you accept
your father's gift to you?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.172
But the gift is a cult.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.299
What isn't a cult?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.593
<i>You wear your
LurlyLimon leggings</i>

17:32.593 --> 17:34.512
<i>to yoga class
where you hurt your body</i>

17:34.512 --> 17:36.514
<i>to impress the tiny lady.</i>

17:36.514 --> 17:38.599
<i>You get your hair done
exactly the same</i>

17:38.599 --> 17:40.977
<i>as the most powerful girl
at work.</i>

17:40.977 --> 17:43.771
<i>You do everything your
therapist tells you to do.</i>

17:43.771 --> 17:46.107
Our comet's cult-y?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.276
How about
you won't buy a printer

17:48.276 --> 17:50.611
during mercury in retrograde?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.238
You're right.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.992
My life in New York was
as big a cult as this cult.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.327
You could go home
and keep muttering

17:58.327 --> 18:00.371
your genius ideas
under your breath

18:00.371 --> 18:01.914
for the rest of your life,

18:01.914 --> 18:04.792
or you could stay here

18:04.792 --> 18:06.377
and say them out loud.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.172
I do have good ideas.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.341
I should be the boss.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.719
Oh, my God, I said what I mean,

18:14.719 --> 18:16.470
and I'm not doing
a self-deprecating shimmy

18:16.470 --> 18:17.888
to undercut it.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.142
I'll advise you
just like I did for your daddy,

18:21.142 --> 18:23.394
and I admit,
we do need to modernize

18:23.394 --> 18:26.230
and get a little more
young people around here.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.940
I don't even know
who the "Euphoria" generation's

18:27.940 --> 18:29.525
Alan Tudyk is.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.402
Is it Lukas Gage?
Beanie Feldstein?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.029
It's Evan Peters, isn't it?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.614
Evan Peters is 36.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.698
Wait, really?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.117
Aw, I know today was a lot,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.995
but it's just how we say,
"I love you."

18:40.995 --> 18:43.247
And you're not used
to hearing that,

18:43.247 --> 18:45.875
especially not from your mom.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.170
So will you stay, Petey?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.970
Bring forth
the ceremonial dagger.

19:03.559 --> 19:07.938
Bring forth
the ceremonial boo-boo sticker.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.483
All praise
the great daughter!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.443
Praise Petey!

19:12.443 --> 19:16.697
Sweetest, dearest,
loveliest Petra,

19:16.697 --> 19:20.034
what shall be
your first decree?

19:20.034 --> 19:22.161
No more human sacrifice.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.665
Okay.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.000
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.169
We're not wearing
kaftans anymore.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.838
We're wearing jumpsuits.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.507
Jumpsuits!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.306
No human sacrifice?

19:42.306 --> 19:44.058
But that's a pillar
of our faith.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.185
I know, Emmett,
you [bleep] weenie!

19:46.185 --> 19:48.771
Hey, neutral statement!

19:48.771 --> 19:52.191
As long as she's here,
we're fulfilling the prophecy,

19:52.191 --> 19:54.777
but she can never leave.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.862
Well, my dead
ex-husband's daughter

19:56.862 --> 19:59.240
who is now my BFF
just took over the cult

19:59.240 --> 20:00.408
I'm a member of.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.159
This ends well, yeah?

20:02.159 --> 20:05.621
One way or another,
I'm gonna stop her...

20:05.621 --> 20:07.540
and at some point,
I'll probably [bleep] her.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.919
<i>Wow, I guess
I'm a cult leader now.</i>

20:11.919 --> 20:13.838
<i>I'm still not sure
how I feel about it.</i>

20:13.838 --> 20:15.631
<i>It's like I got promoted
to she-E-O</i>

20:15.631 --> 20:18.968
<i>of a super toxic corporation,
hey, but I'm in charge now,</i>

20:18.968 --> 20:21.011
<i>so I can make things better.</i>

20:21.011 --> 20:22.847
<i>Also, I could find out more
about my dad</i>

20:22.847 --> 20:25.307
<i>and maybe impress my mom.</i>

20:25.307 --> 20:27.059
<i>Gee, been up here for a while.</i>

20:27.059 --> 20:28.936
<i>Hope they put me down soon.</i>

20:28.936 --> 20:31.313
<i>How big is this cult?</i>

20:31.313 --> 20:33.774
<i>Wow, I've learned a lot today,</i>

20:33.774 --> 20:36.235
<i>like that Evan Peters is 36.</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:37.862
<i>That seems wrong.</i>

20:37.862 --> 20:40.322
<i>I should remember to google
how old Evan Peters is.</i>

20:40.322 --> 20:43.617
<i>Wow, I'm going really far.</i>

20:43.617 --> 20:46.579
<i>I wonder which celebrities
I can get to join the cult.</i>

20:46.579 --> 20:48.956
<i>Oh, I bet I could get
Frankie Jonas,</i>

20:48.956 --> 20:50.875
<i>or Frankie Grande.</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:52.334
<i>Definitely someone
from Freeform.</i>
