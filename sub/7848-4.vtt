20:02.734 --> 20:04.233
NOT FROM WHERE WE STAND.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.033
I THINK THIS REVIEW IS DONE.

20:06.033 --> 20:08.500
YOU OBVIOUSLY CANNOT
INSPIRE LOYALTY IN STAFF,

20:08.500 --> 20:11.300
AND YOU CERTAINLY ARE
NOT FIT TO RUN A HOTEL.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.400
THIS ISN'T A HOTEL!

20:13.400 --> 20:15.767
THIS IS A CIRCUS
WITH DOGS

20:15.767 --> 20:19.000
AND CATS AND RATS
AND CLOWNS AND TWINS.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.767
THE ONLY THING MISSING
IS A BEARDED LADY.

20:21.767 --> 20:23.600
WATCH IT.

20:23.834 --> 20:27.133
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO WORK HERE.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.400
WELL, THEN CALL ME CRAZY.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.200
MR. MOSEBY, PLEASE
CONTINUE YOUR FINE WORK.

20:33.200 --> 20:38.367
MS. SHIKELGRUBERMIGER,
YOUR TIPTON KEYS,

20:38.367 --> 20:41.767
YOUR NAMETAG,
AND YOUR PEN.

20:41.767 --> 20:43.367
AAH!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.033
NO HARD FEELINGS?

20:46.033 --> 20:49.734
PSYCH!

20:49.734 --> 20:52.033
I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME,
MR. MOSEBY,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.700
AND YOUR LITTLE DOG, TOO!

20:55.367 --> 20:58.900
[ALL CHEERING]

20:58.900 --> 21:00.600
DUT, DUT, DUT!

21:04.133 --> 21:06.567
WAS ALL OF THIS
YOUR DOING?

21:06.567 --> 21:07.500
IT WAS ZACK.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.367
I'M SORRY, MR. MOSEBY.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.867
SO, YOU ENGINEERED
THIS MAYHEM,

21:10.867 --> 21:14.000
NEARLY
DESTROYING MY HOTEL
IN THE PROCESS?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.300
YES, I DID.

21:15.300 --> 21:19.500
I JUST HAVE
ONE THING TO SAY
TO YOU, YOUNG MAN.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.700
THANK YOU.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.233
MY PLEASURE.

21:24.233 --> 21:28.500
HEY, HEY, I HELPED
DESTROY THE HOTEL, TOO.

21:28.500 --> 21:34.300
YOU KNOW, BOYS, NEXT WEEK,
THE HEALTH INSPECTOR'S COMING.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.500
YOU EVER BEEN TO NEW YORK?

21:35.500 --> 21:40.200
THROW IN
YANKEES TICKETS,
AND WE'RE THERE.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.500
OH, PLEASE.

21:45.567 --> 21:49.100
I'M GONNA SEE YOUR BET...

21:49.100 --> 21:51.367
AND RAISE YOU 2.

21:51.367 --> 21:54.300
[DOGS WHIMPERING]
OH, HUSH UP.

21:54.300 --> 21:56.500
PUT YOUR BONES IN
OR FOLD.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.767
[WHIMPERS]

21:57.767 --> 22:01.834
HA HA HA!
ROLL OVER AND WEEP!
