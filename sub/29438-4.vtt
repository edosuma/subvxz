WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:02.745
- Previously on The Resident...
- Does she know

00:02.746 --> 00:04.683
- you're in love with her?
- I'm her mentor. To be

00:04.684 --> 00:06.982
anything else would cross a
line that I would never cross.

00:06.983 --> 00:08.335
That must be hard on you.

00:08.336 --> 00:09.859
You might be a genius at medicine,

00:09.860 --> 00:11.296
but when it comes to love,

00:11.297 --> 00:13.220
these unexpected Raptor feelings

00:13.221 --> 00:14.782
- is too much.
- He's my mentor.

00:14.783 --> 00:15.865
Nothing more.

00:15.866 --> 00:17.927
- Turn off all his morphine.
- You can't be serious.

00:17.928 --> 00:20.649
Then we add a dose of Narcan.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.277
What you're talking about is torture.

00:22.278 --> 00:24.085
What I'm talking about is this man,

00:24.086 --> 00:25.660
who'll die unless Rob Spiro

00:25.661 --> 00:27.185
tells us where he's being held.

00:27.186 --> 00:29.437
- I want no part of it.
- It has to be done.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:45.854 --> 00:47.897
C-Could you slow down?

00:47.898 --> 00:50.233
I'd like to make it to the
conference in one piece.

00:50.234 --> 00:53.178
We will. But riddle me this.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.572
Why is there an illicit bag

00:55.573 --> 00:57.656
of trail mix on my leather upholstery?

00:57.657 --> 00:59.900
Okay, first, you wouldn't
let me choose the music.

00:59.901 --> 01:01.677
The driver picks. Everybody knows that.

01:01.678 --> 01:04.016
- And now you're saying I can't eat.
- What part of "leather upholstery"

01:04.018 --> 01:05.423
does not compute?

01:05.424 --> 01:07.500
For the record, you
could've stayed at Chastain.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.778
Oh, and miss your presentation?

01:09.779 --> 01:12.781
Over somebody else's dead body.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.732
Look, as your mentor,

01:14.733 --> 01:17.836
it's a privilege to
ensure that your debut

01:17.837 --> 01:19.931
at the Society of Georgia Surgeons

01:19.932 --> 01:22.124
is filled with all the pomp

01:22.125 --> 01:24.626
and circumstance it deserves.

01:24.627 --> 01:27.295
This weekend's gonna change your life.

01:33.942 --> 01:34.942
The hell?

01:37.691 --> 01:39.240
I told you to slow down.

01:50.704 --> 01:52.320
What happened to this kid?

01:52.321 --> 01:53.846
Unclear.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.206
Someone said he collapsed
while walking at the mall.

01:56.207 --> 01:58.215
Hold compressions.
Let's check for a pulse.

02:11.558 --> 02:13.651
No cardiac activity.

02:13.652 --> 02:15.860
Been over 30 minutes, no pulse.

02:19.825 --> 02:22.492
Time of death, 14:20.

02:36.416 --> 02:39.010
You know, there's nothing
but brush out here.

02:39.011 --> 02:42.512
You keep pacing like that,
you're liable to start a fire.

02:43.498 --> 02:45.016
Wow.

02:45.017 --> 02:47.225
Looks like somebody's
got the Halloween spirit.

02:48.353 --> 02:50.521
That's up year-round.

02:50.522 --> 02:54.525
Giant homemade voodoo doll
to ward off evil spirits.

02:54.526 --> 02:56.843
Some folks think we're
cursed around here.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.512
All right, lay it on me, my man.

02:58.513 --> 03:00.388
What's wrong with my baby?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.073
Your radiator hose burst.

03:03.115 --> 03:04.824
Ooh! Hello. Um, we have

03:04.825 --> 03:08.280
a medical conference to get to.
How long is that going to take?

03:08.281 --> 03:10.498
Good mechanic can fix it in a day.

03:12.619 --> 03:14.119
You got a guy?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.954
Aren't you our guy?

03:15.955 --> 03:19.074
Best I can do is find you a
shop in the city, come get you.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.626
That's three hours away.

03:20.627 --> 03:22.035
We don't have that kind of time.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.295
So, since he can't get the job done,

03:23.296 --> 03:25.289
let's call Chastain and have Bell send

03:25.290 --> 03:27.800
- the Red Rock chopper.
- That's a solid backup plan,

03:27.801 --> 03:30.043
but it shouldn't be necessary.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.186
I got this.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.589
- Okay.
- Look,

03:34.590 --> 03:36.067
we're here. You're here.

03:36.068 --> 03:38.093
Why can't you just do the repair?

03:38.094 --> 03:40.479
I don't work on cars like this.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.154
Really?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.840
Your customer reviews
online say differently.

03:47.103 --> 03:50.230
Well...

03:50.231 --> 03:52.665
it ain't gonna be cheap.

03:53.868 --> 03:55.277
Well...

03:55.278 --> 03:57.378
it's good that money isn't an object.

03:58.559 --> 04:01.126
So I'm assuming you can give us a ride

04:01.127 --> 04:03.895
in that big old rusty,
sexy truck of yours.

04:15.014 --> 04:17.015
- He's weird.
- Mm.

04:17.016 --> 04:19.685
I usually avoid weird people,
especially on Halloween.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.445
So you want to stay
here till it gets dark?

04:21.446 --> 04:23.446
I'm sure it gets real
fun out here after dark.

04:26.451 --> 04:27.575
- Good point.
- Yeah.

04:36.795 --> 04:39.630
A morgue assistant dressed as a ghost?

04:39.631 --> 04:40.947
Is that good thinking?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.374
Boo.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.817
Are you gonna finish the paperwork

04:44.818 --> 04:46.710
or... what?

04:48.047 --> 04:49.722
Sure thing.

04:55.411 --> 04:58.252
- It's a terrible idea.
- It's a great idea and you're gonna love it.

04:58.253 --> 04:59.327
Okay, can someone

04:59.328 --> 05:00.800
please tell Conrad that
leaving a bowl of candy out

05:00.801 --> 05:02.318
for the trick-or-treaters
was a bad idea?

05:02.319 --> 05:04.010
Yeah, well, the first kid's
just gonna steal it all.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.397
Thank you.

05:05.398 --> 05:07.182
I don't want to come
home to a TP'd house.

05:07.183 --> 05:09.727
Kids are unforgiving if they
think you're not into Halloween.

05:09.728 --> 05:10.993
Why do I get the
impression that you were

05:10.994 --> 05:12.237
one of those unforgiving kids?

05:12.238 --> 05:13.521
You just got to show people

05:13.522 --> 05:15.166
that you're in the spirit.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.505
Wow. Tough crowd.

05:21.506 --> 05:23.798
You guys are no fun.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.386
Hey, Pravesh, could
you please tell me why

05:27.387 --> 05:28.986
your dead patient is
currently sitting up

05:28.987 --> 05:31.554
in his body bag?

05:31.555 --> 05:33.829
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Bring in the crash cart.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.595
- Let's get him up on the monitors.
- I'll bag him.

05:36.596 --> 05:38.430
Hang a liter of saline wide open

05:38.431 --> 05:39.989
and draw a trauma panel.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.433
I'd say this dude looks like he's alive.

05:41.434 --> 05:43.936
He had no pulse, asystole in both leads

05:43.937 --> 05:45.679
and an ultrasound with
no cardiac activity.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.347
Well, there's definitely activity now.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.988
Your patient just came
back from the dead.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.936
Happy Halloween.

05:58.106 --> 06:03.106
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:07.410 --> 06:08.743
Tell me you understand

06:08.744 --> 06:11.413
pronouncing a live
patient dead is a big deal.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.540
Remy had no pulse, no heart sounds,

06:13.541 --> 06:16.584
no spontaneous breaths
or pupillary light reflex.

06:16.585 --> 06:17.895
I followed protocol.

06:17.896 --> 06:19.897
Clearly, your protocol was off.

06:19.898 --> 06:21.473
And what about your protocol?

06:21.474 --> 06:24.092
You tortured a patient.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.311
What we're gonna talk about right now...

06:26.312 --> 06:27.987
is your screwup.

06:29.048 --> 06:30.098
Are we good here?

06:30.099 --> 06:31.558
Yeah.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.077
Just trying to figure out what happened.

06:33.078 --> 06:35.603
They're taking Remy to the ICU.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.430
- I think it's Lazarus syndrome.
- It fits the profile.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.750
Spontaneous return of circulation

06:39.751 --> 06:41.725
- after CPR fails?
- It does happen

06:41.726 --> 06:42.826
once in a blue moon when pressure

06:42.827 --> 06:44.352
builds up in the chest during CPR.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.489
Yeah. There's no explanation
for it. I've seen it one time,

06:46.490 --> 06:47.758
and it looked just like this.

06:47.759 --> 06:49.001
So I didn't screw up.

06:49.002 --> 06:50.952
No. You still screwed up.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.954
- You put the guy in a damn body bag.
- Just dial it back

06:52.955 --> 06:54.555
a little bit. It's a mistake, all right?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.585
Okay. You know what, you
guys? Just have fun with this.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.937
Good luck.

06:59.938 --> 07:03.440
But now that he's alive,
you get a second chance.

07:03.441 --> 07:04.775
So, what caused him

07:04.776 --> 07:06.468
to nearly die to begin with?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.679
Do you idiots want me dead?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.890
I don't want the black doctor
on the billboard out there.

07:11.891 --> 07:12.950
Trauma bay 11.

07:12.951 --> 07:14.133
Or the Indian kid.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.144
30-year-old male. Sudden onset headache.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.645
BP 210/90.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.456
History of a arteriovenous malformation.

07:19.457 --> 07:20.532
Okay, BP is high.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.484
One, two, three.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.210
Okay. Good luck.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.932
Perhaps you don't know who I am?

07:29.933 --> 07:31.468
We know who you are, Hades.

07:31.469 --> 07:33.712
You're hard to miss on social media.

07:33.713 --> 07:35.547
Good, then I shouldn't have to reiterate

07:35.548 --> 07:37.268
that I don't want the
brown guy touching me.

07:41.146 --> 07:42.965
"Feldman"? I don't think
you'll be touching me,

07:42.966 --> 07:44.130
- either.
- Hmm.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.507
Hold on there, cupcake.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.216
- What're you doing?
- I'm starting an IV.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.710
Then I'm going to put leads on your body

07:48.711 --> 07:49.928
for the cardiac monitor.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.544
And I'm going to attach a pulse ox.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.991
All right. You know what?

07:53.992 --> 07:56.643
You don't want to be
treated, that's fine by us.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.952
Let's go.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.168
I wouldn't mess with them if I were you.

08:04.169 --> 08:06.244
Look, I was diagnosed

08:06.245 --> 08:07.987
with the AVM when I was a kid.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.182
Doc said I should call an ambulance

08:10.183 --> 08:12.509
if I ever got a severe headache.

08:12.510 --> 08:15.595
- We'll be back.
- Just you and the girl will do.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.207
More proof

08:19.208 --> 08:21.668
that evil doesn't always come
in a mask on a movie screen.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.045
Guys like him spew
hate on a regular basis,

08:24.046 --> 08:26.381
- and ignorant people eat it up.
- Despite that,

08:26.382 --> 08:27.691
we have to do our jobs

08:27.692 --> 08:29.526
and treat him like any other patient.

08:29.527 --> 08:32.019
- Or not.
- No, you're right.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.054
And that being said,
a headache in someone

08:34.056 --> 08:36.558
with an AVM could
indicate a sentinel bleed.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.518
But he needs an MRI to
confirm because he's...

08:38.519 --> 08:41.038
First, we need to get
his BP under control.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.207
Hypertension could
cause his AVM to rupture.

08:43.207 --> 08:45.876
Which is what I was just about
to say if you'd let me finish.

08:45.877 --> 08:48.045
I'll start a nicardipine drip.

08:48.046 --> 08:49.863
And I will schedule an MRI

08:49.864 --> 08:51.123
and get him sent to the ICU.

08:51.124 --> 08:53.032
I'm gonna go check
on my Lazarus patient.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.243
And I'll come with.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.428
Make sure he doesn't die on us again.

09:00.558 --> 09:03.301
Um... it's Halloween.

09:03.302 --> 09:04.803
Where is everyone?

09:04.804 --> 09:06.805
Shouldn't there be little
kids in annoying costumes

09:06.806 --> 09:08.473
asking for wrapped sugar?

09:08.474 --> 09:11.050
Well, look at all the businesses
that have closed down.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.686
You can't trick-or-treat

09:12.687 --> 09:14.954
if there's nobody to give out the candy.

09:36.002 --> 09:38.453
All right, looks like we're
definitely getting a room.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.014
- Get something to eat?
- Yeah.

09:43.101 --> 09:45.560
Uh, excuse me?

09:46.754 --> 09:49.730
Okay. Well, service needs work.

09:53.352 --> 09:56.696
Go at it. You just have to tug down.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.770
Side-eye alert.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.485
Where are we?

10:34.486 --> 10:36.511
Hey.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.030
You need to order and leave.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.810
Why?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.203
And what happened to your arm?

10:47.332 --> 10:50.149
I'll order you two specials.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.418
To go.

11:03.957 --> 11:06.983
- We need to see Hades right now.
- Visiting hours just ended.

11:06.984 --> 11:08.870
- You'll have to come back tomorrow.
- I don't care.

11:08.871 --> 11:11.021
Like it or not, we're gonna see him.

11:11.022 --> 11:12.138
Why don't you go

11:12.139 --> 11:14.007
- make that happen.
- That won't be necessary.

11:14.008 --> 11:16.009
Dr. Randolph Bell,

11:16.010 --> 11:18.011
CEO, Chief of Surgery here at Chastain.

11:18.012 --> 11:19.387
Zeke Metcalfe.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.055
As I was telling these folks,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.464
- we need to see Hades.
- I understand,

11:23.465 --> 11:25.777
but we can't have people
visiting at all hours.

11:25.778 --> 11:27.756
Our patients need their
rest... it's my job

11:27.757 --> 11:29.281
to make sure they get what they need.

11:29.282 --> 11:30.541
And Hades needs me.

11:30.542 --> 11:32.784
His health is complicated.

11:32.785 --> 11:35.528
If anything comes up, our
staff is capable of handling it.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.531
Yeah? You mean like the
black guy on the billboard?

11:38.532 --> 11:41.552
'Cause if that's the case...

11:41.553 --> 11:43.128
can't say I trust your judgment, Doc.

11:43.129 --> 11:45.204
My judgment is not the issue.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.749
Your compliance is. I don't
like to call the police,

11:47.750 --> 11:49.893
but when a situation warrants, I do.

11:49.894 --> 11:52.211
You tell me.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.480
Does this situation warrant a call?

11:57.143 --> 11:58.476
Okay.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.278
We'll play ball for now.

12:01.406 --> 12:02.906
We'll be back first thing, hmm?

12:04.576 --> 12:07.519
Without the guns.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.378
Georgia might be open carry.

12:09.379 --> 12:12.082
Chastain is not.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.275
You think you're something, huh?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.661
You got that fancy suit.

12:16.662 --> 12:19.572
You got these walls to protect you.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.758
But let me give you the brass tacks.

12:21.759 --> 12:24.744
If anything happens to Hades,

12:24.745 --> 12:27.505
I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible,

12:27.506 --> 12:29.916
and there won't be anyone...

12:29.917 --> 12:33.477
or anything that'll stop
me from getting to you.

13:07.805 --> 13:10.423
- I see Hades has landed.
- He has an AVM,

13:10.424 --> 13:12.099
which may or may not become emergent.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.244
If he dies at Chastain,

13:13.245 --> 13:15.336
there's no telling what
his followers will do.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.671
Yeah, they're a violent bunch.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.673
Sounds like you need
a surgeon to perform

13:18.674 --> 13:21.233
- a flawless AVM resection.
- Preferably before it ruptures.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.653
I'll do it.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.941
He's a racist who incites violence

13:28.942 --> 13:30.351
against people who look like you.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.237
- Why volunteer?
- Because my heart can find

13:32.238 --> 13:33.980
the compassion in all human beings,

13:33.981 --> 13:35.790
no matter our differences.

13:38.411 --> 13:39.986
Just get him out of this hospital...

13:39.987 --> 13:41.504
alive.

13:46.844 --> 13:49.203
Well, if it isn't the poster boy.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.039
Am I supposed to be impressed?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.091
Hey.

13:53.092 --> 13:55.001
Tell me, how does it feel

13:55.002 --> 13:57.211
knowing that you're
only filling a quota?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.431
Chances are your AVM is bleeding.

13:59.432 --> 14:02.359
Without surgery, you
can die at any time.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.361
Might want to be nice to a
man that could save your life.

14:04.362 --> 14:07.071
I will be, once I meet the real American

14:07.072 --> 14:08.365
who should have your job.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.893
I've met my share of people like you.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.793
Weak, ignorant, false
sense of superiority.

14:14.794 --> 14:16.281
Many of them tried to take me down,

14:16.282 --> 14:18.283
but all their efforts ended up the same.

14:18.284 --> 14:20.860
- Yeah? How's that?
- The look.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.547
A pained expression when
they realized I was smarter

14:23.548 --> 14:25.798
and more talented than
they ever would be.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.885
Hey, I know my rights.
I want another surgeon.

14:30.888 --> 14:33.397
Cool. I have no problems

14:33.398 --> 14:36.083
learning about your death on the news.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.769
Wait, please!

14:40.172 --> 14:42.140
Don't listen to him.

14:42.141 --> 14:43.591
To who?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.192
To Hades.

14:46.904 --> 14:49.740
Listen to me. Douglas Atwater.

14:49.741 --> 14:51.908
I-I-I'm begging you.

14:51.909 --> 14:53.868
Help me, please.

14:58.082 --> 15:00.325
We were able to get you off the vent,

15:00.326 --> 15:04.087
but you have what we call
dilated cardiomyopathy.

15:04.088 --> 15:06.256
This puts you at risk for arrhythmias...

15:06.257 --> 15:08.425
which can be fatal.

15:08.426 --> 15:10.219
And if you had one earlier today,

15:10.220 --> 15:12.221
that could explain why
you lost consciousness.

15:12.222 --> 15:14.638
The tests also revealed
that you have liver damage.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.154
He wants to be discharged.

15:19.345 --> 15:21.087
Well...

15:21.088 --> 15:22.939
that would be a mistake.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.108
Okay, we know our rights.
You can't keep him here.

15:25.109 --> 15:27.018
Isn't that right, Remy?

15:27.019 --> 15:28.445
Uh...

15:28.446 --> 15:30.930
Bro, i-if you won't discharge me,

15:30.931 --> 15:32.698
I'll just leave on my own.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.786
Hey.

15:35.787 --> 15:37.862
You are very sick, Remy.

15:37.863 --> 15:40.606
Technically, you
already died once today.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.818
You leave this hospital,
and you could actually die.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.912
Remy, we already ran some basic tests.

15:45.913 --> 15:48.155
Why not just stick around for
all the results to come back?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.548
You have to pay for them anyway.

15:51.397 --> 15:54.532
Okay, fine. But after that,
then we're out of here.

15:58.476 --> 16:02.220
Did you see the track
marks on their arms?

16:02.221 --> 16:04.964
I think they're addicts.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.484
We need to see what drugs he's
taking before we move forward.

16:07.485 --> 16:09.677
Wait, you're speculating.
He needs a cardiac cath

16:09.678 --> 16:12.013
to figure out what
caused his cardiomyopathy.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.514
Might even need a liver biopsy, too.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.182
Did you hear them? They want to leave.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.685
It's hard enough to get them
to wait for Remy's test results,

16:17.686 --> 16:19.663
you want to recommend
invasive procedures?

16:19.664 --> 16:22.189
In this situation, it's called for.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.650
He has life-threatening conditions

16:24.651 --> 16:27.044
that need to be worked up.

16:32.918 --> 16:35.661
Remy doesn't want to be
bombarded with tests right now,

16:35.662 --> 16:38.389
so we build up some trust first,
and then we go from there.

16:39.517 --> 16:40.724
Understood?

16:43.712 --> 16:47.398
I was diagnosed with multiple
personality disorder as a kid.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.194
Hades... the man you've
been speaking to...

16:51.195 --> 16:53.921
- he takes over my body.
- You lost me at multiple personality disorder.

16:53.922 --> 16:55.607
- It's-it's a real thing.
- It's not.

16:55.608 --> 16:58.129
It is. A do-doctor in
Oregon diagnosed us.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.927
- I can get you his number.
- A doctor in California says

16:59.928 --> 17:02.447
that yogurt treats brain
tumors. Doesn't make it so.

17:02.448 --> 17:05.733
You-you have no idea of the
hell that Hades puts me through.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.377
He makes all of our decisions.

17:07.377 --> 17:09.028
He insults me. He suppresses me.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.122
I lose control every
day, but right here,

17:11.123 --> 17:12.715
right now I am winning.

17:12.717 --> 17:14.700
I have an opportunity
to get what I want,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.053
and I want you to operate.

17:17.054 --> 17:19.464
And you're willing to
sign a consent for surgery?

17:19.464 --> 17:21.473
Yes.

17:23.394 --> 17:25.352
Okay.

17:26.564 --> 17:28.413
The car won't be finished today,

17:28.414 --> 17:30.406
but we can still make it
to the conference on time

17:30.407 --> 17:32.451
if we leave early tomorrow.

17:42.321 --> 17:44.894
Here's your food.

17:44.895 --> 17:47.810
I suggest you check into your
hotel room and eat upstairs.

17:47.811 --> 17:49.443
Hey, let's-let's hit pause

17:49.444 --> 17:51.087
on the dramatic heads-up for a minute.

17:51.088 --> 17:53.951
- Let's talk about that arm.
- It looks inflamed,

17:53.952 --> 17:56.784
and has grown past the bandage.
Have you seen a doctor?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.452
We don't have doctors in this town,

17:58.453 --> 18:00.011
so I drove three hours to Atlanta

18:00.012 --> 18:02.599
and got a prescription for
penicillin that isn't working.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.434
There must be some reason why
the antibiotic isn't working.

18:06.845 --> 18:08.680
Sonya.

18:08.681 --> 18:10.515
Everything okay over here?

18:10.516 --> 18:11.849
We're okay, Phil.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.142
Hey, listen,

18:13.143 --> 18:14.593
Phil, we are okay.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.137
All right? We don't want any problems.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.322
You don't like black people. We get it.

18:21.285 --> 18:22.435
They're not racist.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.362
That's not why you're not welcome.

18:24.363 --> 18:26.864
We want you to leave
because you're doctors.

18:26.865 --> 18:30.368
Boone spread the word
you're from Chastain.

18:30.369 --> 18:32.963
Which means you work for
Red Rock Mountain Medical.

18:32.964 --> 18:34.947
The company that bought our hospital

18:34.948 --> 18:36.524
and shut it down because no one here

18:36.525 --> 18:37.957
could afford their inflated bills.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.618
I was a nurse anesthetist.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.620
Best damn job I ever had.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.215
I took care of their
electrical, top to bottom.

18:44.216 --> 18:46.000
Did it for 30 years.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.386
I used to make good
money at my pharmacy.

18:48.387 --> 18:50.671
Now there's no one here
to write prescriptions.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.263
All the doctors left
when the hospital closed.

18:53.264 --> 18:55.560
Leaving us to care for our elderly

18:55.561 --> 18:58.427
and mentally ill on our own.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.803
We had nothing to do with that,

18:59.804 --> 19:01.399
so if there's any way we can help...

19:01.400 --> 19:04.154
- Like looking at the arm.
- Look, eat here if you want,

19:04.155 --> 19:05.505
but please, just leave me alone.

19:32.817 --> 19:35.151
He's in V-tach. Move.

19:36.602 --> 19:38.980
Get a crash cart in here now!

19:38.981 --> 19:41.439
- Wait, what's happening?
- His heart stopped beating again.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.323
I need one of epi and charge to 200.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.779
Charge.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.167
Clear.

19:49.168 --> 19:50.572
None of that is gonna work.

19:50.573 --> 19:53.184
Bella, please, we are trying
to save Remy's life. Okay.

19:53.185 --> 19:54.193
Charge again.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.903
Clear.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.505
Stop! You can't save him, but I can.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.743
Remy needs some of my blood.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.845
Because he's a vampire and so am I.

20:09.554 --> 20:12.201
Let's start him on 300
milligrams of amiodarone.

20:12.202 --> 20:14.070
- And get another EKG.
- Right away.

20:14.071 --> 20:16.254
He doesn't need that. He needs blood.

20:16.255 --> 20:17.922
You guys don't get it. This is why

20:17.923 --> 20:19.322
we didn't tell you how we live.

20:19.323 --> 20:21.298
The media just spouts so many lies.

20:21.299 --> 20:22.845
We're not here to judge you.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.821
- We just want to help.
- In order to treat

20:24.822 --> 20:26.672
and diagnose you correctly...

20:27.992 --> 20:30.651
... Remy, tell us about
your vampirism lifestyle.

20:33.238 --> 20:34.613
We...

20:34.614 --> 20:37.166
feed on a limited amount

20:37.167 --> 20:39.134
of one another's blood.

20:40.111 --> 20:42.303
Al-Always safely.

20:42.304 --> 20:44.430
Okay. So...

20:44.431 --> 20:46.190
what does that do for you?

20:46.191 --> 20:48.025
It gives us energy.

20:48.026 --> 20:49.476
Vitality.

20:49.477 --> 20:52.365
Imagine the most alive you've ever felt

20:52.366 --> 20:53.647
and multiply it by ten.

20:53.648 --> 20:55.366
And since we share blood,

20:55.367 --> 20:57.651
it's like we share one essence.

20:57.652 --> 20:59.653
Our connection...

20:59.654 --> 21:01.915
is both physical and spiritual.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.115
Remy, we still don't know

21:03.116 --> 21:04.663
what caused you to collapse earlier.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.452
The answer could be in your blood.

21:06.453 --> 21:08.880
- You need more extensive tests.
- No, he doesn't.

21:08.881 --> 21:10.882
- We've been safe.
- You love Remy.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.976
We can see that.

21:12.977 --> 21:16.220
Regardless of how safe you
are, you're sharing blood,

21:16.221 --> 21:18.564
which means you're both at
risk for blood-borne illnesses.

21:23.061 --> 21:25.804
If Bella's in danger,
there's no question.

21:25.805 --> 21:27.072
Do the test.

21:28.308 --> 21:30.742
I won't let you take any risks.

21:36.691 --> 21:38.150
I hear you met Hades

21:38.151 --> 21:39.410
and Doug.

21:39.411 --> 21:41.078
Word travels fast.

21:41.079 --> 21:43.783
Don't often see DID
patients around here...

21:43.784 --> 21:46.586
dissociative identity disorder...
whatever they're calling

21:46.587 --> 21:48.921
multiple personality
disorder these days.

21:48.922 --> 21:51.398
Why bother renaming
something that's pure fiction?

21:51.399 --> 21:54.133
I don't believe that... I mean,
I've seen a handful of cases

21:54.134 --> 21:55.808
- during my career.
- Well, if it does exist,

21:55.809 --> 21:58.501
it's not because of anyone's
childhood or their mommy.

21:58.502 --> 22:00.844
I think it's a cagey
form of manipulation.

22:00.845 --> 22:02.744
How can you say that
with so much certainty?

22:02.745 --> 22:03.961
I mean, don't you think we should look

22:03.962 --> 22:06.139
at our patient's
psychiatric records to see

22:06.140 --> 22:08.689
what a doctor who has a
degree in that area has to say?

22:08.690 --> 22:11.716
I heard the words "we" and "our".

22:11.717 --> 22:14.219
Are you tagging yourself on to my case?

22:14.220 --> 22:15.902
Who do you think scheduled the MRI

22:15.903 --> 22:17.462
that's currently in progress?

22:28.643 --> 22:30.126
Well, now we have confirmation

22:30.127 --> 22:31.979
that the AVM needs to be excised.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.505
It's hemorrhaging into the temporal lobe

22:33.506 --> 22:34.648
and the surrounding tissue.

22:34.649 --> 22:37.674
What's this, next to the AVM?

22:37.675 --> 22:39.969
Looks like mesial
temporal lobe sclerosis,

22:39.970 --> 22:42.323
inflammatory scarring.

22:42.324 --> 22:45.016
People with sclerotic tissue
are more prone to seizures,

22:45.017 --> 22:47.986
but in this area of the brain,

22:47.987 --> 22:50.497
it presents as personality changes.

22:50.498 --> 22:53.667
Doug is having seizures that
are manifesting as Hades?

22:53.668 --> 22:56.207
Yes. It's not DID.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.889
It's temporal lobe epilepsy as
a result of sclerotic tissue.

23:00.699 --> 23:03.801
Which means I can
literally cut out Hades.

23:04.904 --> 23:06.303
I can get him into the OR tonight.

23:06.304 --> 23:09.091
You're talking about removing
a portion of this man's brain.

23:09.092 --> 23:10.425
You know as well as I do

23:10.426 --> 23:12.019
there could be serious
consequences to this.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.370
We need a second opinion,
a neurology consult,

23:14.371 --> 23:16.872
and more than anything, we
need to see his psych records.

23:16.873 --> 23:20.549
Nevin, I like you most of the time.

23:20.550 --> 23:23.075
But you're a nurse practitioner.

23:23.076 --> 23:25.803
Don't ever question me.

23:29.537 --> 23:31.705
And with one delicate
stroke of the scalpel,

23:31.706 --> 23:33.857
I can and will, single-handedly,

23:33.858 --> 23:36.568
free you from the evil
that has hijacked your life.

23:36.569 --> 23:39.737
Thank you, Dr. Cain. Thank you.

23:39.738 --> 23:41.541
It's my pleasure.

23:41.542 --> 23:43.341
Oh, you're so pathetic.

23:45.744 --> 23:47.221
Did you really think I wouldn't fight

23:47.222 --> 23:48.705
my way back to the surface?

23:48.706 --> 23:50.874
You need consent to operate.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.250
I already got the consent from Doug.

23:52.251 --> 23:53.877
Oh, yeah, that shadow of a man?

23:53.878 --> 23:55.420
I'm revoking it.

23:55.421 --> 23:58.256
I'll go to another hospital.

23:58.257 --> 24:00.191
Get my discharge papers.

24:08.726 --> 24:10.618
Hi, Remy.

24:12.229 --> 24:14.355
All of your hepatitis
panels and the HIV test

24:14.356 --> 24:15.940
- came back negative.
- So we added on

24:15.941 --> 24:18.729
some additional studies
looking at your iron levels.

24:18.730 --> 24:21.446
You have hemochromatosis.
It's a condition

24:21.447 --> 24:23.239
where the body stores too much iron.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.503
Excess iron poisons
organs, which, for you,

24:26.504 --> 24:29.096
- caused heart and liver disease.
- Okay.

24:29.097 --> 24:32.248
Is it treatable? Tell me it's treatable.

24:32.249 --> 24:34.918
It is. We reduce
the iron levels in your body

24:34.919 --> 24:36.603
and, because blood is rich in iron,

24:36.604 --> 24:38.771
the best course of action is...

24:41.592 --> 24:43.259
bloodletting.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.946
We'll need to do a phlebotomy tonight.

24:45.947 --> 24:48.449
And every week for the next month.

24:48.450 --> 24:51.557
It will give your body
the best chance to recover.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.479
Wait. You're-you're
talking just a little.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.123
Like, drops, right?

24:56.124 --> 24:58.200
Remy will need to give a pint

24:58.201 --> 24:59.882
each time. And in order

24:59.883 --> 25:02.420
to maintain control over your disease...

25:03.930 --> 25:06.714
... you can't take in any excess iron.

25:06.715 --> 25:08.269
It's not their call.

25:08.270 --> 25:09.870
We need to discuss this. Leave us alone.

25:31.517 --> 25:33.401
Uh, my bad.

25:33.402 --> 25:35.520
Look, even the Raptor
is a little rattled

25:35.521 --> 25:36.823
this Halloween evening, right?

25:36.824 --> 25:38.648
Yeah. It's okay.

25:38.649 --> 25:40.334
But we'll get a good night's rest.

25:40.335 --> 25:42.911
Tomorrow, this town will be far behind.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.988
And the next phase of your career begins

25:44.989 --> 25:46.748
with this speech.

25:46.749 --> 25:48.509
You sound so sure.

25:48.510 --> 25:50.660
Let me break it down
to you, Miss Cleo style.

25:50.661 --> 25:53.680
Your speech is going to be fire.

25:53.681 --> 25:57.017
You're going to receive
countless fellowship offers,

25:57.018 --> 26:00.003
and in five years you will
no longer need a mentor,

26:00.004 --> 26:02.355
and we will be...

26:05.527 --> 26:06.984
... something else.

26:11.075 --> 26:12.467
Something more.

26:13.998 --> 26:16.541
But I will still consider
myself the better.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.734
And you would be wrong.

26:18.735 --> 26:21.753
Oh, we'll see.

26:26.122 --> 26:27.530
Okay.

26:27.531 --> 26:31.008
Um, thanks for everything.

26:35.247 --> 26:36.889
- Night.
- Good night.

27:00.748 --> 27:02.324
I don't see discharge papers.

27:02.325 --> 27:03.941
That's because you're
not going anywhere.

27:03.942 --> 27:06.086
At least not till I say so.

27:06.087 --> 27:09.831
Yeah. See, no one... let
alone someone like you...

27:09.832 --> 27:11.966
is gonna keep me here against my will.

27:13.128 --> 27:14.911
I agree.

27:14.912 --> 27:16.513
You know what?

27:19.599 --> 27:21.532
Which is why your will

27:21.533 --> 27:23.587
- needs to be taken.
- What is that?

27:23.588 --> 27:24.896
Little dose of ketamine.

27:30.070 --> 27:31.736
What the hell did you just do?

27:36.100 --> 27:38.077
What people like you do to others.

27:38.078 --> 27:40.079
I'm taking away your right

27:40.080 --> 27:42.080
to be treated like a human being.

27:45.827 --> 27:47.161
Is this it?

27:47.162 --> 27:48.445
That does it for the day.

27:48.446 --> 27:49.738
Do you need anything else?

27:49.739 --> 27:51.923
No. You're free to go.

28:17.433 --> 28:20.953
I told you if anything happened to Hades

28:20.954 --> 28:22.245
you'd see me again.

28:23.606 --> 28:26.816
That black doc... he
took him into surgery

28:26.817 --> 28:28.202
against Hade's will.

28:28.203 --> 28:30.037
If he dies

28:30.038 --> 28:31.446
or he wakes up

28:31.447 --> 28:34.467
as anything other than himself,

28:34.468 --> 28:36.553
you and that doc

28:36.554 --> 28:39.021
will pay dearly.

28:46.556 --> 28:48.155
Dr. Cain.

28:48.156 --> 28:49.848
Dr. Cain.

28:49.849 --> 28:51.415
Don't worry, I've got consent.

28:51.416 --> 28:54.117
- There's my AVM.
- From what I understand,

28:54.118 --> 28:56.426
you had consent. Put the scissors down.

28:56.427 --> 28:58.160
Now it's time to cut out Hades.

28:58.161 --> 29:00.145
Are you removing the sclerotic tissue?

29:02.311 --> 29:05.056
Think about what you're doing.

29:05.057 --> 29:07.533
You're better than him.
You're better than this.

29:13.006 --> 29:14.881
I'm better because I can do this.

29:32.717 --> 29:33.900
What are you doing?

29:39.682 --> 29:41.157
Let me go.

29:42.893 --> 29:44.278
Let me go.

29:44.279 --> 29:46.113
Somebody! Help!

29:46.114 --> 29:48.790
She's missing something crucial.

29:50.568 --> 29:51.834
Go ahead and cut.

29:57.384 --> 29:58.841
Here we go.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.721
No. No! No!

30:13.257 --> 30:15.050
Mina. Mina!

30:15.051 --> 30:17.652
Mina, I'm coming!

31:30.218 --> 31:32.627
She doesn't have a heart.

31:32.628 --> 31:34.129
What?

31:34.130 --> 31:35.396
Wh-What?

31:36.632 --> 31:37.632
What?

31:52.523 --> 31:55.416
Mina! Mina, are you okay?

31:58.505 --> 32:00.580
I do have a heart.

32:00.581 --> 32:02.590
Of course you do.

32:39.787 --> 32:43.188
Your actions not only
put Chastain in jeopardy,

32:43.189 --> 32:45.071
you put my life at risk as well.

32:45.072 --> 32:47.294
I did what I had to do.

32:47.295 --> 32:49.204
And I live and breathe
for risks like this.

32:49.205 --> 32:51.056
No one has to break the law.

32:51.057 --> 32:53.041
And just to be clear,
that's what's happened.

32:53.042 --> 32:54.876
Chastain's not going
down for what you did.

32:54.877 --> 32:57.229
You're on your own.

32:57.230 --> 32:58.988
Actually, I'm not.

33:00.233 --> 33:01.641
Excuse me?

33:01.642 --> 33:03.902
In case you hadn't noticed, I can do...

33:03.903 --> 33:05.436
whatever the hell I want.

33:06.597 --> 33:08.598
I'm a cash cow for Red Rock,

33:08.599 --> 33:11.577
which means when you
sold Chastain to them,

33:11.578 --> 33:14.154
providing cover for me
became your number-one job.

33:14.155 --> 33:17.422
So, if and when the time
comes for you to explain

33:17.423 --> 33:20.318
what happened here
today, I have no doubt

33:20.319 --> 33:22.069
that you will find the right spin.

33:23.498 --> 33:25.573
Because without me,
there is no Red Rock.

33:25.574 --> 33:27.133
There's no Chastain.

33:28.410 --> 33:29.719
Or you.

33:44.018 --> 33:45.944
All right.

33:45.945 --> 33:48.096
How we doing?

33:48.097 --> 33:50.348
Have you made a decision?

33:50.349 --> 33:53.142
Yes. Remy doesn't want treatment.

33:53.143 --> 33:55.028
We're leaving now. We are who we are,

33:55.029 --> 33:56.551
and you'll never understand it.

33:56.552 --> 33:58.532
Remy, I know that it is difficult,

33:58.533 --> 34:00.275
but you have to face the fact that

34:00.276 --> 34:01.794
vampirism will cost you your life.

34:01.795 --> 34:03.486
- We don't believe that.
- Actually, Bella,

34:03.487 --> 34:05.413
I-I do believe it.

34:08.467 --> 34:10.493
I've always known I'm not a vampire.

34:10.494 --> 34:12.786
Wait, what are you saying?

34:12.788 --> 34:14.639
You've been lying all this time?

34:14.641 --> 34:17.500
To-to make you happy, to keep you.

34:17.501 --> 34:19.627
Uh, fake fangs? No problem.

34:19.628 --> 34:21.504
A night in a coffin? No big deal.

34:21.505 --> 34:24.841
I drank blood because I would
do anything to make you happy.

34:24.842 --> 34:28.344
I know I'll never get
another woman like you.

34:28.344 --> 34:30.346
I'm-I'm "swipe left". I know that.

34:30.347 --> 34:32.072
I can't believe it.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.620
You're a liar.

34:34.621 --> 34:36.476
I-I know. I'm-I'm sorry.

34:36.478 --> 34:38.210
I... I don't want to lose you,

34:38.212 --> 34:40.562
but I have a life-threatening
condition now.

34:40.563 --> 34:42.333
I have to stop being a vampire.

34:42.335 --> 34:45.820
Many couples have different
belief systems and are happy.

34:45.821 --> 34:46.862
No.

34:46.864 --> 34:49.032
I could never be with this man again.

34:49.033 --> 34:50.366
Two people this fundamentally different

34:50.367 --> 34:51.634
cannot remain together.

34:52.753 --> 34:53.886
No way.

34:59.710 --> 35:01.853
I'm sorry, man.

35:07.051 --> 35:08.818
Coming. Coming!

35:09.921 --> 35:13.514
Hey. We got a medical emergency.

35:13.515 --> 35:17.202
Sonya. Looks like they
need our help after all.

35:18.562 --> 35:20.563
Who are you? What are you doing?

35:20.564 --> 35:22.374
Get off of me! Someone help, please!

35:23.784 --> 35:24.784
What's wrong with her?

35:26.236 --> 35:29.047
Based on the mixed delirium,
the blisters and ulcers

35:29.048 --> 35:31.550
on her arm, Sonya has
necrotizing fasciitis.

35:31.551 --> 35:33.558
- What the hell is that?
- It's a flesh-eating

35:33.559 --> 35:35.203
disease caused by the same bacteria

35:35.204 --> 35:36.613
that causes strep throat.

35:36.614 --> 35:39.082
We need to surgically remove
the infected tissue now.

35:39.083 --> 35:42.043
Surgery? Just where do
you plan on doing that?

35:42.044 --> 35:43.970
At a hospital. You got one sitting there

35:43.971 --> 35:45.809
- across the street.
- It's been closed for months.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.856
Then we open it.

35:46.857 --> 35:48.308
Nec fas spreads within hours,

35:48.309 --> 35:50.176
leading to sepsis,
amputation and then death.

35:50.177 --> 35:53.363
Look, you feel betrayed
by doctors, right?

35:53.364 --> 35:55.431
Fine. We get it. But
you need to get over it

35:55.432 --> 35:59.077
and trust us, or Sonya here
is going to die tonight.

36:01.730 --> 36:03.582
We're with you.

36:03.583 --> 36:05.583
All right, let's get moving.

36:14.243 --> 36:16.169
So how'd you sleep?

36:16.170 --> 36:18.246
- Blissfully.
- Like a baby.

36:18.247 --> 36:20.265
Hmm. Some people,

36:20.266 --> 36:22.716
when they come to this
town, have strange dreams.

36:24.086 --> 36:26.104
Well, I have them, too.

36:26.105 --> 36:28.515
I think it has to do with
Red Rock Mountain Medical.

36:28.516 --> 36:32.185
When they left, they disposed
of all kinds of medications

36:32.186 --> 36:34.095
by putting them down the drain.

36:34.096 --> 36:36.139
Each year, the EPA finds

36:36.140 --> 36:38.383
pharmaceutical-grade
chemicals in the groundwater.

36:38.384 --> 36:40.794
The drugs could eventually
contaminate drinking water, too.

36:40.795 --> 36:42.086
Low doses of antibiotics

36:42.087 --> 36:43.778
in the water supply can make superbugs

36:43.779 --> 36:45.538
resistant to all antibiotics.

36:47.352 --> 36:50.177
Which may be why penicillin
did nothing for Sonya.

36:50.178 --> 36:51.687
And psych meds in the water

36:51.688 --> 36:53.914
have also been known
to cause strange dreams.

36:55.452 --> 36:57.736
Mina, are you sure you slept okay?

36:59.647 --> 37:01.665
We should focus on the work.

37:17.883 --> 37:19.809
You sure this is necessary?

37:19.810 --> 37:21.913
We hate the idea of
her going to Chastain.

37:21.914 --> 37:24.095
I know, but Sonya needs
to be hospitalized.

37:24.096 --> 37:25.130
I'll go back with her.

37:25.131 --> 37:27.316
I'll make sure she gets
the best care, okay?

37:27.317 --> 37:29.343
I don't know what we'd
have done without you.

37:29.344 --> 37:30.987
Hey, all of you chipped in.

37:30.988 --> 37:32.804
This is a hell of a town.

37:32.805 --> 37:34.657
A town without a hospital.

37:34.658 --> 37:36.310
If we have another medical emergency...

37:36.311 --> 37:37.809
Get your water checked.

37:37.810 --> 37:39.686
And then you sue the
hell out of Red Rock

37:39.687 --> 37:41.463
- when you get the results.
- You're suggesting

37:41.464 --> 37:43.407
we sue the hospital that employs you.

37:43.408 --> 37:46.335
- Yup.
- Yeah.

37:46.336 --> 37:48.091
Your car's good to go.

37:48.092 --> 37:49.974
Well, that is music to my ears.

37:49.975 --> 37:51.550
What do I owe you?

37:51.551 --> 37:53.852
The repair is on the house.

37:54.702 --> 37:55.886
Appreciate that.

38:01.092 --> 38:03.669
You know I want to hear
your presentation, right?

38:03.670 --> 38:06.271
Yeah, I do.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.826
My baby is yours.

38:11.827 --> 38:13.736
You treat her nice,
she'll be good to you.

38:13.737 --> 38:16.504
Oh, no, I can't drive your
car. You love that machine.

38:16.505 --> 38:19.048
True, but I know
she'll be in good hands.

38:19.049 --> 38:21.574
Besides, you're a queen.

38:21.575 --> 38:23.075
You need a proper chariot.

38:52.892 --> 38:55.784
We both know there's something going on.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.737
Let's talk about what's bothering you.

39:04.439 --> 39:07.274
Okay.

39:07.275 --> 39:10.110
Look, I'm grateful for
everything you've taught me.

39:10.111 --> 39:13.296
But there are some lessons
that I don't want to learn.

39:14.499 --> 39:15.925
What lessons?

39:15.926 --> 39:18.285
I think you know.

39:18.286 --> 39:20.954
You cross lines that
I would never cross.

39:20.955 --> 39:24.416
You're talking about
the hostage situation,

39:24.417 --> 39:28.295
the man I got released,
who's safe with his family?

39:28.296 --> 39:31.607
No, I'm talking about the
patient that you tortured

39:31.608 --> 39:33.800
to get the information that you needed.

39:33.801 --> 39:35.902
The ends don't justify the means.

39:37.597 --> 39:39.886
So we have different
styles and boundaries.

39:39.887 --> 39:43.119
No, it's more than that.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.270
We are very different people

39:45.271 --> 39:47.914
with different beliefs.

39:49.868 --> 39:51.943
And neither of us are ever gonna change.

40:12.507 --> 40:15.175
My bad.

40:15.176 --> 40:17.177
Forgot to tell you.

40:17.178 --> 40:19.471
Don't look at the
person in front of you.

40:19.472 --> 40:22.399
It'll psych you out for no good reason.

40:33.411 --> 40:35.153
You got this.

40:35.154 --> 40:38.082
There is no one in that
building who can touch you.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.033
Remember who you are.

40:41.702 --> 40:43.636
I'm Dr. Mina Freaking Okafor.

40:52.713 --> 40:55.599
When I first stepped
out on that stage...

40:59.437 --> 41:01.988
... I wasn't worried about
the people in the seats.

41:05.059 --> 41:06.993
I couldn't even see 'em.

41:08.229 --> 41:09.396
Because in my mind,

41:09.397 --> 41:10.948
there was only one person

41:10.949 --> 41:13.376
I wanted to hear me speak in that room.

41:13.377 --> 41:17.213
So I imagined that person was there,

41:17.214 --> 41:18.630
cheering me on.

42:01.616 --> 42:03.167
Doug's psych records.

42:03.168 --> 42:05.002
You should have waited for them.

42:05.003 --> 42:07.595
You would have made a
different decision last night.

42:15.648 --> 42:17.589
Actually, Doug's last
psychiatrist didn't agree

42:17.590 --> 42:19.633
with the DID diagnosis, either.

42:19.634 --> 42:22.260
He also believed that it was
the temporal lobe epilepsy.

42:22.261 --> 42:24.763
Right, but after treating
him, he had a different opinion

42:24.764 --> 42:26.264
on the seizures.

42:26.265 --> 42:28.032
Look at the doctor's note.

42:44.968 --> 42:47.619
Hello, poster boy.

42:47.620 --> 42:49.663
I was right about the seizures

42:49.664 --> 42:51.665
creating an alternate personality.

42:51.666 --> 42:53.475
I was wrong about which one.

42:54.644 --> 42:56.887
Doug was the alternate personality.

42:56.888 --> 42:59.798
And now he's gone,

42:59.799 --> 43:02.734
and I am unchained.

43:05.822 --> 43:07.957
And there it is.

43:07.958 --> 43:09.399
That pained expression

43:09.400 --> 43:11.309
when you realize

43:11.310 --> 43:13.161
you're not as smart
as you think you are.
