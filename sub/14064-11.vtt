00:02.332 --> 00:03.925
Previous on Boston Legal.

00:04.033 --> 00:07.403
Do we have anybody in corporate
who understands this credit card world?

00:07.503 --> 00:08.938
- Somebody-
- Hands.

00:09.038 --> 00:12.271
- Sorry?
- Hands Swenson. Banking and finance genius.

00:12.374 --> 00:14.207
- Only don't call him Hands.
- Why would I?

00:14.309 --> 00:16.575
- Bingo!
- Why doesn't he move his hands?

00:16.678 --> 00:19.240
- Bingo.
- Are you making fun of me?

00:19.346 --> 00:23.184
Should we be married and sensible and
go home to do whatever men do at home?

00:23.283 --> 00:25.752
I have nothing against marriage.
I've done it five times.

00:25.853 --> 00:28.949
But here's the thing about wives.
Theydon’s let you play with your friends.

00:29.054 --> 00:31.924
I'll take a friend
over wife every time.

00:43.167 --> 00:45.966
Not only a patron of the arts...

00:46.068 --> 00:51.408
Denny Crane is a generous contributor
of his time, energy and enthusiasm.

00:51.508 --> 00:53.636
What the hell kind of charity
is Children's Group?

00:53.742 --> 00:57.146
- We're teaching children to read.
- No. We're buying them food.

00:57.245 --> 00:59.714
I thought we were providing them
with old people to play with.

00:59.814 --> 01:02.546
I believe it's
a children's theater group.

01:02.649 --> 01:05.120
How can kids with muscular dystrophy
do theater?

01:05.218 --> 01:09.248
- They don't have muscular dystrophy.
- Then what are we doing here?

01:09.355 --> 01:11.985
- Judas Priest, there's a game on.
- Don't be long, Denny.

01:12.090 --> 01:14.583
- Your speech is up next.
- And you might want to actually practice it...

01:14.692 --> 01:18.496
- considering you're the honoree.
- Not to worry. It's all up here.

01:20.531 --> 01:22.797
Please tell me there's
no press here tonight.

01:32.841 --> 01:36.075
Scotch.
Single malt.

01:36.177 --> 01:38.410
Straight.

01:41.782 --> 01:44.309
Nice night.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.246
Suddenly, it is.

01:49.354 --> 01:51.518
He's often told me
that writing a check is easy.

01:51.624 --> 01:53.684
- It's only money.
- Should we go look for him?

01:53.792 --> 01:56.787
He'll be here. Denny's never
one to miss the spotlight.

01:56.895 --> 01:59.867
But rolling up your sleeves and
getting dirty out on the front lines...

01:59.965 --> 02:03.425
that is not easy.

02:04.735 --> 02:07.500
I'll wrap this up
before his head swells too much.

02:07.603 --> 02:11.167
The emcee's winding down, people.

02:11.272 --> 02:14.267
I knew we should've tagged him.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.972
- Denny Crane!
- Ladies and gentlemen...

02:17.079 --> 02:20.608
the Children's Group
applauds and honors...

02:20.714 --> 02:22.809
Mr. Denny Crane.

02:22.916 --> 02:27.186
Dear Lord.

02:33.492 --> 02:36.555
Thank you. Thank you.

02:36.661 --> 02:40.691
There is no doubt we do it
all for the children.

03:15.226 --> 03:17.321
And what did you think of my speech?

03:17.428 --> 03:20.729
- Excellent.
- Thank you for writing it for me.

03:20.832 --> 03:23.826
Give me a call sometime. You know
how to use a business card, don’t you?

03:23.934 --> 03:27.202
- You just whip it out of your pocket and-
- Blow.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.671
- You look puzzled.
- I am.

03:35.777 --> 03:39.511
A woman I just had sex with hands me
her card and I have no desire to throw it away.

03:39.614 --> 03:43.246
- You had sex with her here?
- Hot, sweaty sex...

03:43.350 --> 03:46.253
right there in the coat-check room.

03:49.789 --> 03:51.952
Keep it.

04:07.436 --> 04:11.102
Daniel Post, C. E. O.,
Christ berg Pelham, Incorporated.

04:11.208 --> 04:14.236
He has stage four
metastasized lung cancer.

04:14.342 --> 04:16.244
Never fun.

04:16.345 --> 04:19.041
A major pharmaceutical company
was testing a new cancer drug.

04:19.147 --> 04:22.951
Post used his friendship with
the C. E. O. of that company...

04:23.051 --> 04:24.953
to get himself put
into the test group.

04:25.053 --> 04:29.117
And to make sure that he got
the actual drug, not the placebo.

04:29.223 --> 04:32.558
Hmm. The rich are different
from you and me.

04:32.657 --> 04:35.220
Certainly from you. So...

04:35.327 --> 04:38.731
Post is being sued by another
cancer patient...

04:38.830 --> 04:42.769
who was in the same study, and
who ended up getting the placebo.

04:42.867 --> 04:45.268
- What's the cause olfaction?
- What you'd expect.

04:45.368 --> 04:49.638
Conspiracy, intentional infliction
of emotional distress.

04:49.739 --> 04:52.107
We're going to court today.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.302
Today?

04:54.408 --> 04:56.470
I thought I could-

04:56.578 --> 04:59.482
handle it myself but, uh-

04:59.581 --> 05:03.247
O- Olivia died of cancer, didn't she?

05:05.019 --> 05:07.615
Yes.
At any rate...

05:07.721 --> 05:10.317
I'm hoping you can second chair.

05:10.422 --> 05:13.917
- You ready?
- Uh, Denise Bauer, attorney.

05:14.026 --> 05:17.362
- Daniel Post.
- Guy dying of cancer.

05:17.462 --> 05:20.593
- Is that the way he described me?
- Rich guy dying of cancer.

05:22.366 --> 05:25.031
Denise will be second chairing.
I filled her in on the case.

05:25.136 --> 05:28.005
Actually, you left out our defense.
Do we have one?

05:28.105 --> 05:30.871
I like her.

05:30.973 --> 05:34.207
I'm not sure if the jury
is going to like me, Mr. Post.

05:34.309 --> 05:37.440
I have a client who tried to buy
his way into a cancer study.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.447
Could you tell me
what possessed you to do that?

05:39.547 --> 05:42.313
I got cancer.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.317
Are you really my lawyer?

05:44.418 --> 05:46.888
Or did the Make-A-Wish Foundation
just finally come through?

05:53.992 --> 05:56.486
Alan, do you have a minute?

05:56.595 --> 05:59.293
What can I do for you, Jerry?

06:04.702 --> 06:08.334
They are meeting soon to vote on
this year's partnerships.

06:08.438 --> 06:12.708
This'll be my third time
to be up for partner.

06:12.809 --> 06:15.643
- My last time.
- I see.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.806
I was wondering if maybe you
could tell me where I stand.

06:18.913 --> 06:21.680
You know the right people
around here.

06:21.783 --> 06:24.150
And I know-

06:24.251 --> 06:26.586
Well, no one.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.386
Jerry, you are
an extraordinary attorney.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.858
I am.

06:32.959 --> 06:37.399
I constructed a chart
that reveals...

06:37.495 --> 06:41.093
my involvement is typically
the key variable...

06:41.199 --> 06:43.101
in the firm's winning a case.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.432
Bingo!
It was my research...

06:45.535 --> 06:49.167
that was the determining factor in
the Simmons versus Aragon Oil _city.

06:49.272 --> 06:53.838
Not to mention 252 other cases.

06:53.942 --> 06:57.108
Because of my research.
Bingo!

06:59.381 --> 07:02.374
But still, I wonder...

07:02.482 --> 07:07.117
whether the senior partners
are aware of my contributions.

07:07.221 --> 07:12.687
Jerry, you know I have a tremendous
affection for my own intelligence.

07:12.792 --> 07:15.421
And even I think
you are smarter than me.

07:15.526 --> 07:18.293
Oh, I am.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.366
I'll see what I can find out.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.810
How long have you worked for Devlin
Macgregor Pharmaceuticals, Mr. Clark?

07:33.909 --> 07:36.175
- Eight years.
- And what was your position?

07:36.278 --> 07:38.908
I was a lab technician
in ontological protocols.

07:39.013 --> 07:42.315
- You worked on a drug to cure cancer?
- Trade name is Pneumitrox.

07:42.416 --> 07:45.947
It was specifically designed to hinder
the rapid cellular mutations in the lungs.

07:46.054 --> 07:50.721
And did Devlin Macgregor conduct
a double-blind study to test Pneumitrox?

07:50.823 --> 07:53.658
- Sort of.
- Why do you say sort of, sir?

07:53.759 --> 07:56.094
- The test was corrupted.
- Objection. Foundation.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.993
Overruled.

07:58.096 --> 08:01.432
On July 9 of this year, you received
a call from your supervisor. What did he want?

08:01.532 --> 08:03.832
He told me to ensure
that Patient 1123...

08:03.934 --> 08:05.835
received the Pneumitrox
and not the placebo.

08:05.936 --> 08:07.929
- Why?
- He didn't say.

08:08.038 --> 08:12.273
But I subsequently discovered that Patient 1123
is Mr. Post. It seemed fairly obvious.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.934
- Objection.
- Sustained.

08:14.042 --> 08:16.411
What made you come forward?

08:16.512 --> 08:20.076
Doing so has cost you
your job, correct?

08:20.182 --> 08:23.642
- It did.
- Then why?

08:23.750 --> 08:27.120
Because some things are
more important than job.

08:27.220 --> 08:30.158
Mr. Clark, how many patients
were involved in the experiment?

08:30.257 --> 08:33.787
- Uh, 2, OOO.
- And statistically speaking...

08:33.893 --> 08:36.591
how would it change the likelihood...

08:36.695 --> 08:40.599
of one person out of the 2, OOO
receiving the drug over the placebo...

08:40.697 --> 08:43.032
if another person
was directed to get the drug?

08:43.134 --> 08:46.664
- Not much.
- Because there was no guarantee...

08:46.770 --> 08:49.640
that any of the volunteers
would receive the actual drug.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.834
The odds were originally 50-50?

08:51.941 --> 08:54.378
The odds would change minimally.

08:54.477 --> 08:57.607
Instead of50-50...

08:57.712 --> 08:59.705
the odds would change from...

08:59.815 --> 09:03.720
49.95 to 50.05.

09:03.818 --> 09:06.813
- Uh, sounds right.
- So virtually no change at all?

09:09.223 --> 09:13.060
Well, if you were dying,
Miss Bauer,.05 is everything.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.436
Shirley, I wanted to ask you
about Jerry Swenson.

09:25.535 --> 09:28.268
- He's up for partner.
- I can't discuss that with you.

09:28.372 --> 09:31.309
- Why not?
- Well, that determination is for partners only...

09:31.408 --> 09:33.310
and you're not a partner.

09:33.410 --> 09:36.507
- I'm sure you understand, Alan.
- Absolutely.

09:36.612 --> 09:39.777
Jerry Swenson? You mean Hands?
Not a chance. He's a weirdo.

09:39.881 --> 09:42.546
He's not a weirdo.
And he doesn't like to be called Hands.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.246
- How could you not? The "hands. "
- A peccadillo, to be sure.

09:45.353 --> 09:47.254
- We all have them.
- I don't have any peccadilloes.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.754
- What's your name, Denny?
- Denny Crane.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.758
Ah! Yes.

09:50.858 --> 09:54.695
My point is, Jerry Swenson
deserves to be made a partner.

09:54.794 --> 09:58.392
What is that?

09:58.498 --> 10:03.735
Bev bought me a camera phone.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.736
The woman you enjoyed
in the coatroom?

10:05.836 --> 10:09.275
We can send each other pictures.

10:09.373 --> 10:13.005
This damn thing
takes forever to load.

10:13.109 --> 10:15.579
Things going well with Bev, then?

10:15.677 --> 10:19.879
She said she wanted to fulfill
every single one of my fantasies.

10:19.982 --> 10:23.249
I made a list.
Had to type it myself.

10:23.352 --> 10:25.720
- My assistant threatened to quit.
- Denny, you're glowing.

10:25.820 --> 10:29.919
She's an amazing woman, Alan.
It's like having a one night stand...

10:30.023 --> 10:33.894
- but every night with the same woman.
- I'm thrilled for you, Denny.

10:33.993 --> 10:36.521
- Now, about Jerry.
- He's not a rainmaker, Alan.

10:36.629 --> 10:40.729
Shirley says he's not bringing in
enough money. He's toast. Weird toast.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.530
Would you let me have a glance
at his performance review, then?

10:43.634 --> 10:48.575
It's highly confidential.
Just don't tell anybody where you got it.

10:48.671 --> 10:53.545
Oh, picture's finally loaded.
look at this.

10:53.643 --> 10:56.944
She's vey limber
for a woman her age.

10:57.045 --> 11:01.486
Alan, I'd like to be
alone with my phone.

11:01.582 --> 11:03.484
Just 15 minutes.

11:16.462 --> 11:19.992
- "Poor people skills. "
- Just hands it to you.

11:20.098 --> 11:22.124
- "Not presentable. "
- That's my Denny.

11:22.233 --> 11:25.069
"Not a team player. "
I can see why it's confidential.

11:25.169 --> 11:28.141
- It's revolting and mean.
- You don't have all the facts, Alan.

11:28.239 --> 11:31.142
Apparently I do. Apparently at this firm,
being white and male isn't even enough.

11:31.241 --> 11:34.543
You also need to be a golden retriever with
a pedigree to be considered for partner.

11:34.643 --> 11:36.806
- I'm telling you-
- It's a wonder you slipped under the radar...

11:36.912 --> 11:39.815
- with your vagina and all.
- Jerry’s had a few blowups, Alan.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.816
- One in front of a client.
- Yes. Yes.

11:41.916 --> 11:45.013
It's on his permanent
record back in 2000.

11:45.119 --> 11:47.988
It also says he made a couple
of clients feel awkward.

11:48.088 --> 11:50.821
Could that be perhaps
because he's an awkward guy?

11:50.924 --> 11:52.825
It also says he doesn't play golf.

11:52.925 --> 11:56.455
Actually, he doesn't kiss any ass
whatsoever. He just does his job.

11:56.562 --> 11:59.966
And no one's denying that.
But partners need to bring in clients.

12:00.065 --> 12:03.868
That's how we make our money.
Partners need to attend social dinners...

12:03.969 --> 12:06.030
and make public speaking
engagements.

12:06.137 --> 12:09.006
And they need to do it
without being-

12:09.106 --> 12:12.340
Different.
Very dangerous, Shirley.

12:12.443 --> 12:14.504
Very dangerous.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.975
You know how the obituaries
always say things like...

12:21.083 --> 12:25.022
"So-and-so died after
a brave struggle with cancer"?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.750
I'm not brave.
I'm terrified.

12:29.023 --> 12:32.655
Cancer can make
a coward out of anybody.

12:32.759 --> 12:35.126
So when you heard about
the trials for this new drug-

12:35.227 --> 12:37.197
Oh, I leapt at it.

12:37.297 --> 12:39.357
I'm not a fool.

12:39.465 --> 12:42.904
I knew it was a random chance
I'd even get the drug and not the placebo-

12:43.001 --> 12:46.462
Okay. I was willing
to leave that to fate.

12:46.571 --> 12:50.101
He wasn't.

12:50.207 --> 12:52.108
Mr. Hopper, when
you began the test...

12:52.209 --> 12:55.203
did you stop taking chemo
or any other treatments for your cancer?

12:55.311 --> 12:59.843
No. But there were other promising tests
I didn't enter because of Devlin Macgregor.

12:59.948 --> 13:03.819
I see. And did Devlin Macgregor guarantee
that you would receive the actual drug?

13:03.918 --> 13:05.979
No, they did not.

13:06.087 --> 13:08.818
Isn't it true that you've
already sued Devlin Macgregor...

13:08.922 --> 13:10.892
for this matter,
and received a sizable settlement?

13:10.991 --> 13:13.586
- Objection. Relevance?
- I'm going to allow it.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.725
Yes. But I spent every penny
on medical treatments.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.995
But the money isn't the reason
I'm doing this. I'm doing this because I feel...

13:22.099 --> 13:25.869
I have a moral obligation to stand up
to people like Daniel Post.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.906
People like that...

13:28.005 --> 13:32.104
with money and power, they think
they can get away with murder.

13:32.209 --> 13:34.110
And now he's murdering me.

13:37.079 --> 13:39.676
No further questions, Your Honor.

13:39.782 --> 13:41.580
Court will resume
tomorrow at 1 O a. m.

13:43.484 --> 13:46.547
Denise, are you trying to make
the jury hate our client?

13:47.821 --> 13:51.191
If so, you're doing a good job.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.127
- I'm starting not to like me either.
- Mr. Post, I-

13:54.227 --> 13:56.458
Denise, I'm kidding.
You're doing an excellent job.

13:56.562 --> 13:58.361
I have a few questions.

13:58.464 --> 14:03.873
- Um, are you free for a bite?
- Um, couldn't you just ask me now?

14:03.968 --> 14:07.372
Well, yeah.
But then it wouldn't be a date.

14:14.011 --> 14:17.505
- Our client just asked me out to dinner.
- Well, good.

14:17.613 --> 14:20.345
Then you can use the time
to convince him to settle.

14:25.319 --> 14:29.282
Jerry, it's not looking like a lock.

14:29.390 --> 14:34.730
- What's the problem?
- Generally, it's poor people skills.

14:34.827 --> 14:39.667
You mean, I'm odd?
Does it say, in my file, I'm odd?

14:39.765 --> 14:42.600
- No.
- Alan, I would appreciate candor here...

14:42.701 --> 14:44.671
even should you deem it hurtful.

14:44.769 --> 14:49.335
According to your file, you've occasioned
clients to feel uncomfortable.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.345
Some have even expressed reservations
about being alone with you.

14:56.912 --> 15:01.580
Evidently, you also once pushed
opposing counsel over some dispute.

15:01.684 --> 15:03.984
He made fun of me.

15:04.085 --> 15:07.990
As conditioned as I've become
to ridicule, sometimes-

15:10.791 --> 15:13.660
- So I'm out.
- It's not over.

15:13.762 --> 15:16.857
You know, I deserve this
more than Brad Chase.

15:16.962 --> 15:22.167
He cuts offal priest's fingers
and I lose out because I push a bully?

15:22.268 --> 15:24.669
- It's not right.
- It's not over.

15:24.770 --> 15:29.973
Jerry, I give you my word
I'll do what I can.

15:35.780 --> 15:38.375
Shirley, I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you knock.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.611
Gee, I- I wonder why that could be.

15:41.717 --> 15:44.689
Maybe because you were
too busy having sex on your desk?

15:44.787 --> 15:47.622
How did you know?
I had the door closed.

15:47.723 --> 15:50.660
Ah. But you neglected
to draw all the blinds.

15:50.758 --> 15:53.855
Oversight.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.861
We were both facing the same way.

15:55.961 --> 15:58.831
I'm all too horribly aware
of which way you were facing.

15:58.931 --> 16:02.893
Oh, goodness me.
I'm so rude.

16:03.001 --> 16:05.495
I'm Beverly Bridge.

16:05.604 --> 16:08.574
Shirley Schmidt.

16:08.673 --> 16:11.667
Did you finish the notes
on the partnership candidates?

16:11.775 --> 16:14.008
- I've been busy.
- The vote's tomorrow.

16:14.111 --> 16:17.082
Fifty of the most senior partners
will be there.

16:18.682 --> 16:20.742
This is unprofessional, Denny.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.183
You're setting a very bad example
for the rest of the firm.

16:23.285 --> 16:26.257
Understood. And from now on,
in this office...

16:26.354 --> 16:28.847
those blinds go down
before anybody else does.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.569
- She’s jealous.
- Poor thing.

16:44.136 --> 16:47.039
- Hi, Brad.
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

16:47.138 --> 16:49.574
A little nervous about
that partner thing. You?

16:49.674 --> 16:52.043
I can't say I'm not.

16:52.143 --> 16:55.113
- Got any indication?
- Not really.

16:55.211 --> 16:57.978
Paul seems to think it looks good.
But I certainly didn't help my chances by-

16:58.080 --> 17:00.049
Lewiston? He says
it looks good for you?

17:00.148 --> 17:03.245
- He couldn't make any promises.
- Did he mention how it looks for me?

17:03.351 --> 17:06.950
- No. We didn't really discuss you.
- Do you ever?

17:07.055 --> 17:09.617
- I beg your pardon?
- Do people discuss me?

17:09.723 --> 17:14.188
Do they talk about me
being odd because of my behavior?

17:14.294 --> 17:17.094
Jerry, everyone here
knows you to be a fine lawyer.

17:17.195 --> 17:21.363
That's all I've ever heard discussed.

17:21.465 --> 17:25.702
It's in my file that I'm violent
because I pushed another lawyer once.

17:25.804 --> 17:29.743
- How do you know what's in your file?
- I have a mole-

17:29.840 --> 17:32.710
right here on my neck.

17:34.478 --> 17:38.041
It's not like me to make awoke.

17:38.146 --> 17:42.519
I hope it's in my file I'm funny.
That's a good social skill.

17:49.923 --> 17:53.829
Given the evidence, a credible witness and
documented proof that you were administered...

17:53.927 --> 17:56.591
- the actual drug and not a placebo_
- Question.

17:56.696 --> 17:59.258
- Go.
- When do you see yourself liking me?

17:59.365 --> 18:03.270
Uh, Mr. Post- Daniel-

18:03.368 --> 18:08.139
um, plaintims attorney has been vey
effective in turning the jury against you.

18:08.238 --> 18:10.402
You come off as someone of privilege...

18:10.508 --> 18:14.447
who has everything the jury wants
but doesn't have.

18:14.544 --> 18:19.952
- Except the girl.
- Bottom line, it's in your best interest to settle.

18:20.048 --> 18:23.613
- How about we negotiate a settlement?
- I'm not following.

18:23.719 --> 18:27.214
I agree to settle the case if you agree
to stop talking about it and-

18:27.322 --> 18:29.986
and declare this an official date.

18:34.093 --> 18:37.190
Have you ever done anything nice
for anybody? Ever?

18:37.297 --> 18:39.267
You're tying
to get a look under the hood.

18:39.365 --> 18:41.630
Not until you agree.

18:43.469 --> 18:45.700
- Agreed.
- The answer's yes.

18:45.804 --> 18:48.776
But my mom taught me that it's impolite
to brag about one's good works.

18:48.874 --> 18:51.470
Then don't brag. Tell.

18:51.575 --> 18:53.602
What's to say?

18:53.711 --> 18:57.480
Um, my company sent
thousands of pounds of supplies...

18:57.580 --> 19:01.110
down to New Orleans before FEMA
even put its pants on.

19:01.216 --> 19:05.657
I fund a charter school for
learning-disabled kids here in South Boston.

19:05.754 --> 19:08.350
I don't think the government
does enough to help its people...

19:08.457 --> 19:11.986
so I give as much as I can.

19:12.092 --> 19:14.927
- Do you know why I can do that?
- You're a rich guy who throws his weight around.

19:15.027 --> 19:16.998
It goes hand in hand.
Money gives me connections.

19:17.097 --> 19:20.466
Connections let me do
what I want, get what I want.

19:20.566 --> 19:24.471
You really don't care
what anybody thinks, do you?

19:24.569 --> 19:27.405
I got stage four lung cancer.

19:27.505 --> 19:30.966
I don't give a damn what anybody
I don't know thinks about me.

19:31.075 --> 19:35.038
Life's too short. Really.

19:37.647 --> 19:42.680
One more question.
Why are you really settling?

19:44.252 --> 19:46.653
Did Mr. Hopper's testimony
get to you?

19:46.756 --> 19:49.225
It did.

19:49.323 --> 19:52.591
But don't get me wrong. I-I-

19:52.693 --> 19:55.324
I would do it again.

19:55.429 --> 19:59.630
It was a chance. And so I took it.

19:59.733 --> 20:02.499
And, uh, as it turned out...

20:02.601 --> 20:05.937
the Pneumitrox didn't work
as well as I'd imagined, so-

20:06.037 --> 20:08.531
Given that I have
less time than I'd hoped...

20:08.640 --> 20:13.581
I don't intend to waste
that time fighting a lawsuit.

20:13.678 --> 20:16.741
So I'll settle.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.511
Now. More wine?

20:37.196 --> 20:41.568
You look distressed.
Your Guns demo magazine late again?

20:41.667 --> 20:44.194
She hasn't called all day.

20:44.302 --> 20:47.536
- Ah. Bev.
- It's nearly4:OO.

20:47.639 --> 20:49.904
She hasn't called the office.

20:50.008 --> 20:53.469
She hasn't called my cell phone.
I checked the machine at home.

20:53.577 --> 20:56.947
- 9:15, 9:30, 9:45-
- Okay. I sense a pattern.

20:59.114 --> 21:01.414
I've done something.

21:03.552 --> 21:07.822
I bought her a gift.
I bought her a gift.

21:09.323 --> 21:11.258
Well, in time, I'm sure
she'll forgive you.

21:11.358 --> 21:14.558
Don’t you see? I didn't- I didn't give
her money, like I do most women.

21:14.661 --> 21:17.462
I didn't have a personal shopper
pick something out.

21:17.564 --> 21:17.564
I shopped!
And I, Denny Crane...

21:18.565 --> 21:22.163
I shopped!
And I, Denny Crane...

21:22.268 --> 21:24.260
thought about what she would like.

21:24.369 --> 21:27.967
Maybe I'm having a stroke.

21:28.073 --> 21:31.307
- Maybe it's the mad cow.
- Maybe you’re in love.

21:34.278 --> 21:40.017
- I am delirious with joy.
- Denny, you enjoy being with Bev.

21:40.116 --> 21:45.023
She enjoys being with you. Why don’t you
just have fun in the moment?

21:45.120 --> 21:47.147
And leave it at that?

21:47.255 --> 21:50.192
I knew you wouldn't understand,
you heartless bastard!

21:54.996 --> 21:57.124
Wow. He's got it bad.

21:57.230 --> 22:01.603
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
Yes, he does. Vey.

22:01.701 --> 22:04.536
You wanted me to tell you when
that partnership voting thing was?

22:04.636 --> 22:07.004
Starts in 20 minutes.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.146
And now we turn our attention
to our next candidate, Brad Chase.

22:16.881 --> 22:19.214
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

22:19.315 --> 22:24.188
I have an urgent announcement to make
regarding national security.

22:24.285 --> 22:26.984
I don't think our county
is being run vowel.

22:29.257 --> 22:31.819
That concludes the national security
announcement.

22:31.926 --> 22:36.127
Now, on to other business.
I'm looking at a group of partners...

22:36.229 --> 22:38.996
in a world-class law firm...

22:39.099 --> 22:42.629
each of whom owes some of their success
toner Swenson.

22:42.735 --> 22:45.331
When any of you is stumped
and you need someone...

22:45.437 --> 22:49.137
who has an encyclopedic knowledge
of the law...

22:49.240 --> 22:53.146
and the creative spark to know how
to apply it, whose door do you knock on?

22:53.244 --> 22:56.842
Mr. Shore, we appreciate your input,
but you are not a partner.

22:56.947 --> 22:59.885
Yes. But that's only
because I can't be trusted.

22:59.984 --> 23:05.051
I have here the confidential report
ornery Swenson...

23:05.155 --> 23:08.650
known to some of you who
should know betters "Hands. "

23:08.757 --> 23:14.256
This report, while acknowledging
that Jerry works very hard...

23:14.361 --> 23:17.299
and has an astute legal mind...

23:17.397 --> 23:21.997
also makes some veiled references
to inappropriate behavior.

23:22.102 --> 23:25.199
But really, this is
about money, isn't it?

23:25.304 --> 23:27.603
And whether Jerry Swenson
brings in enough?

23:27.705 --> 23:32.112
And don't we all
just love our money?

23:32.209 --> 23:36.377
You people must realize
that once the rainmakers...

23:36.480 --> 23:38.950
have brought in
the million-dollar accounts...

23:39.049 --> 23:42.112
those clients expect excellent
representation for their money.

23:42.218 --> 23:45.712
And Jerry is a big part
of what they're paying for.

23:45.821 --> 23:48.792
My God, why isn’t
being brilliant enough?

23:48.890 --> 23:52.852
Why can't a lawyer be
a valuable asset to this firm...

23:52.960 --> 23:55.932
without being a smiling Ken doll
with an aggressive handshake?

23:56.030 --> 23:58.125
Does everyone at the firm
have to be this guy?

23:58.231 --> 24:00.360
Mr. Shore, you have
no standing at this meeting.

24:00.466 --> 24:02.560
We would like to ask you
to leave, please, now.

24:06.638 --> 24:12.206
Jerry Swenson has given
15 years of his life to this firm.

24:12.310 --> 24:15.805
His work has been essential.

24:15.913 --> 24:20.115
How dare you invade the province
of a private partnership meeting?

24:20.218 --> 24:22.483
I'm sorry. I didn't think
an invitation was forthcoming.

24:22.585 --> 24:25.785
There's a lot you don't know about
the business of running a law practice, Alan.

24:25.888 --> 24:28.085
- The first rule being-
- It's a business. I understand that.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.660
But it's a service business. You don't
peddle widgets. You don't push stocks.

24:30.758 --> 24:33.389
You sell your people. And as far as
your people go, I'll take Jerry Swenson-

24:33.494 --> 24:35.486
- Don't give me-
- Well, you need to hear it!

24:35.596 --> 24:39.501
I said nothing when you fired Sally Heap,
whose only infraction was to sleep with me.

24:39.599 --> 24:42.765
I made not a peep when you deftly
ushered Lori Colson out of the firm.

24:42.868 --> 24:45.840
I even understood when you fired
Catherine Piper, a woman I profoundly adore.

24:45.938 --> 24:49.273
I swallowed all obit,
because I know it's a business.

24:49.373 --> 24:54.612
But to abuse a talented, selfless employee
only because his social skills lack polish...

24:54.713 --> 24:58.311
tallow him to work tirelessly under
the delusion that he could make partner-

24:58.415 --> 25:01.614
a delusion you nurtured so as to make
piles of money off him in the short term-

25:01.718 --> 25:03.779
That's a betrayal, Shirley,
not just offer...

25:03.886 --> 25:05.855
but of you and your character...

25:05.954 --> 25:09.154
which up till now, I have
considered undeniably decent!

25:09.258 --> 25:12.321
- Are you finished?
- No!

25:12.426 --> 25:16.628
Jerry Swenson no doubt will go off quietly
into the night as the meek often do.

25:16.731 --> 25:18.427
But somebody here
has to get angry about it.

25:18.531 --> 25:20.831
Otherwise, you’ll just go off
and blithely do it again.

25:20.934 --> 25:24.168
We have not yet made a decision
concerning Jerry Swenson.

25:24.271 --> 25:29.269
When we do, I will call you first
to tell you it is none of your concern.

25:29.374 --> 25:31.867
There's a saying, Shirley.
Perhaps you've heard it.

25:31.976 --> 25:35.608
"All it takes for evil to succeed
is for good people to say, 'It's a business. "'

25:45.054 --> 25:47.456
I'd been given a death sentence.

25:49.959 --> 25:53.898
You're the one person in this room
that knows exactly what that's like.

25:55.562 --> 25:59.160
And there was this drug.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.236
And I thought it could help me.

26:01.334 --> 26:04.966
So I used all my power and my influence
to make sure that I got it.

26:05.071 --> 26:07.803
But I didn't think it through...

26:07.907 --> 26:10.843
and I didn't think that there might be
consequences for other people.

26:10.942 --> 26:16.579
In this case, for you.
And I see now that I hurt you.

26:16.681 --> 26:19.710
And I am sorry.

26:19.817 --> 26:21.843
This is our offer.

26:21.951 --> 26:26.915
It's the only one we're going to make.
And it expires when we walk out the door.

26:40.167 --> 26:43.196
This is a very generous offer.
Just think about your family.

26:43.303 --> 26:46.901
- I don't care.
- This could be very long and drawn out.

26:47.006 --> 26:52.414
- That's exactly what it should be.
- What do you want?

26:52.509 --> 26:56.882
If take your money,
it won't be hurting you.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.114
The only thing that will really
hurt you now is if take your time.

27:01.218 --> 27:03.916
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

27:22.035 --> 27:24.768
- I need to talk to you.
- You'll talk to me.

27:24.871 --> 27:28.640
No, I won't. You have a wife.
You have a family.

27:28.741 --> 27:32.909
You owe something to them.
But you also owe something to yourself.

27:33.011 --> 27:35.776
I know this road.

27:35.879 --> 27:39.444
Do not allow anger to consume
the last days of your life.

28:01.368 --> 28:04.305
- Bev.
- Yes, Denny Crane?

28:04.405 --> 28:07.433
Would you like some... money?

28:07.539 --> 28:10.636
I- I- I don't-

28:10.742 --> 28:13.338
Bev, I'm afraid.

28:13.444 --> 28:16.006
- Of?
- Myself. of course.

28:17.715 --> 28:20.743
As godlike as I seem to you
and other people, there's a-

28:20.850 --> 28:25.348
there's a- a mortal inside this...

28:25.454 --> 28:27.617
godlike shell.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.689
I don't trust myself.

28:33.594 --> 28:37.762
Bottom line...

28:37.865 --> 28:41.497
I am not a one-woman man.

28:44.938 --> 28:49.709
You know, Denny, we're both
much too old for this, and too smart.

28:49.809 --> 28:52.108
- We are?
- Is there a powerful man out there...

28:52.210 --> 28:54.112
who hasn't felt what you’re feeling?

28:54.212 --> 28:56.876
No.
So why fight it?

28:56.980 --> 29:00.646
I mean, people don't change their stripes
and you don't want me to change you.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.984
And I certainly don't
want you to change me.

29:04.086 --> 29:06.887
Therefore, Denny Crane...

29:06.989 --> 29:09.117
as long as we're together...

29:09.224 --> 29:11.661
feel free to have sex
with anyone else you want.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.099
Bev!

29:18.565 --> 29:22.630
I love you.

29:27.941 --> 29:31.744
Brad, it was a enclose vote but...

29:34.279 --> 29:36.511
you made it.

29:36.614 --> 29:39.585
You are now comically full partner
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

29:39.683 --> 29:42.951
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Paul. I will not let you down.

29:45.654 --> 29:47.555
Brad. On your knees.

29:47.656 --> 29:50.422
- What?
- Denny, must we do this every single time?

29:50.525 --> 29:55.193
My name on the door, the answer
would byes. On your knees.

29:57.665 --> 30:02.868
Brad Chase, I hereby
dub thee Brad Chase.

30:02.970 --> 30:06.602
- Welcome, partner.
- Thank you...

30:06.706 --> 30:08.675
my lord?

30:16.881 --> 30:20.581
- You wanted to see me, Shirley?
- Yes, Jerry.

30:20.683 --> 30:22.585
Out of courtesy, I'll be brief.

30:22.686 --> 30:26.784
I'm visor, but you
won't be making partner.

30:28.924 --> 30:31.418
But I've done everything
I've been asked.

30:31.528 --> 30:35.432
Your work here is considerable.
It’s just not enough.

30:37.198 --> 30:39.566
- Not enough?
- I won't lead you on.

30:39.666 --> 30:42.570
There will be no further
opportunities for partnership.

30:42.669 --> 30:46.267
However, we certainly appreciate
all your hard work...

30:46.373 --> 30:48.639
and we welcome you
to stay of counsel.

30:48.741 --> 30:54.378
- The choice is yours.
- Okay.

31:07.089 --> 31:09.423
You free for dinner?

31:09.525 --> 31:12.428
Because I got a private chef that
makes a mean breakfast in bed.

31:12.528 --> 31:15.260
You see where I'm going with this?

31:17.331 --> 31:19.234
A- A friend of mine just made partner.

31:19.334 --> 31:21.963
So we’re going to celebrate.
You know, cake-

31:22.068 --> 31:24.301
- Rain check?
- Sure, sure, okay.

31:24.405 --> 31:28.606
I got nothing but time. Oh, wait.
You know, that's not true.

31:32.878 --> 31:35.314
Mr. Lewiston tried to impress
upon me...

31:35.414 --> 31:38.112
that I not consume the rest
of my life with anger.

31:38.215 --> 31:41.949
The truth is, anger can sates_...

31:42.052 --> 31:44.022
while despair is rather empty.

31:44.121 --> 31:47.923
- You don't seem very satisfied.
- This isn't simply about vengeance, Mr. Post.

31:48.023 --> 31:50.927
If you were the only one out there
corrupting medical testing...

31:51.026 --> 31:55.865
perhaps I'd take your money,
or if not, your apology.

31:55.964 --> 31:59.528
But there are others like you.
Maybe this will send a message.

31:59.633 --> 32:04.370
Maybe that will be
the final legacy of my anger.

32:11.410 --> 32:14.541
Guy acts like he's
the only one dying around here.

32:16.780 --> 32:19.616
About that dinner-

32:23.987 --> 32:26.184
Not enough.

32:30.125 --> 32:33.928
Not enough.
Where is my coffee mug?

32:36.064 --> 32:39.525
- Surprise!
- Oh, no!

32:39.635 --> 32:42.070
Look at that!

32:42.168 --> 32:46.131
Not enough!
It is not enough!

32:46.239 --> 32:48.471
It's not enough!

32:54.513 --> 32:57.040
My initials on
the briefcase? Nice touch.

33:10.793 --> 33:13.194
Jerry.

33:13.294 --> 33:17.668
Why don’t you come on in?
Have a piece of cake.

33:23.270 --> 33:26.070
- Here, I'll get it for you.
- No. I can do it.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.574
Okay.

33:35.047 --> 33:39.215
How's that, Shirley?
Is that enough?

33:44.155 --> 33:47.388
How about that?

33:48.491 --> 33:52.932
Is that enough?
Is that-

33:53.028 --> 33:54.792
Look, Hands-
I mean, Jerry-

33:54.896 --> 33:58.733
Everybody stand back! I'll kill her!

33:58.832 --> 34:00.928
I swear, I will kill her!

34:12.678 --> 34:15.376
I want to be made partner.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.475
I'm going to draw up an agreement.
And you're going to sign it, Shirley.

34:18.583 --> 34:21.076
It'll include a "hold harmless"
clause for this assault.

34:21.185 --> 34:25.147
This is a crime. Hold harmless clauses are
for insurance and real estate, not for crime.

34:25.254 --> 34:26.780
Don't say crime.
We’re just talking here.

34:26.889 --> 34:29.382
- It certainly won’t cover attempted murder.
- Don't say murder.

34:29.492 --> 34:34.399
You, substandard first-year- Go pull the
criminal law treatise at 22 A. L. R. 3rd 1228.

34:34.496 --> 34:37.525
Reference cases that hold
extreme emotional conditions...

34:37.632 --> 34:39.659
diminish one's responsibility
fore crime.

34:39.766 --> 34:43.728
You! What do you think you’re doing?

34:43.837 --> 34:47.172
- Going to get one of your guns?
- No. Why would I do that?

34:47.273 --> 34:49.175
The one day
I don't wear my sock holster.

34:49.275 --> 34:52.338
You, substandard partner-

34:52.445 --> 34:57.944
_teem Rosenberg versus Kaplan.
273 Mass. 411.

34:58.049 --> 35:01.146
The facts of the case can be construed
to uphold an employment contract...

35:01.252 --> 35:03.244
even though
it's entered into under duress.

35:04.422 --> 35:08.759
You, hot secretary
that makes me nervous-

35:10.126 --> 35:13.155
Get me a copy of the firm's
partnership agreement...

35:13.262 --> 35:15.960
and prepare to make some changes.

35:16.064 --> 35:18.968
- Larry, this is never going to work.
- Pipe down.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.093
Don't stand. Go.

35:23.937 --> 35:26.169
Get my guns!

35:26.273 --> 35:28.606
- I'm calling the police.
- Which gun should I get?

35:28.708 --> 35:31.976
No guns! Just look
at the damn cases.

35:32.077 --> 35:35.847
Subsection one,
upon his or her motion...

35:35.947 --> 35:38.280
a named partner
may unilaterally reconsider...

35:38.382 --> 35:40.945
the rejection of a senior associate
for partnership.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.681
- Did you get all that?
- Yes, Jerry.

35:43.789 --> 35:46.850
Please type it up. Clackety-clack!

35:51.461 --> 35:54.694
- What's going on?
- Hands went nuts.

36:00.902 --> 36:03.463
I found the cases you wanted.
They're excellent.

36:03.570 --> 36:09.481
Thank you.
- Jerry, what are you doing?

36:09.576 --> 36:13.015
Taking matters into my own hands.

36:14.246 --> 36:16.909
That's right, people.
I said hands.

36:17.015 --> 36:20.248
See, I can be just
as funny as you jokesters.

36:20.350 --> 36:23.516
- Why aren’t you all laughing?
- Don't do this, Jerry, please.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.057
Stop now, before this
gets too out offhand-

36:27.857 --> 36:31.694
Control. I will help you.

36:31.794 --> 36:33.695
Like you did with the partnership?

36:33.796 --> 36:37.291
You don't want to throw away
an entire life's worth of work...

36:37.399 --> 36:39.835
over one emotional outburst.

36:39.934 --> 36:42.838
I don't want to see
the most gifted legal mind...

36:42.937 --> 36:47.001
I have ever encountered
rotting in a prison cell.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.513
Now put down the knife, Jerry.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.452
On one condition.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.922
You represent me once I'm arrested.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.026
I can't.
That's a conflict of interest.

37:09.125 --> 37:12.119
I don't care. You know the firm
can waive that conflict.

37:12.228 --> 37:15.962
I know that you’ll honor that waiver, because
if nothing else, you're a man of your word.

37:20.635 --> 37:24.972
- Make the deal.
- I'll represent you.

37:25.071 --> 37:27.440
Now hand me the knife.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.387
Oh! Everyone!

37:47.491 --> 37:50.017
This is the cake
I want for my birthday.

37:57.432 --> 37:59.766
This is really good work.

38:03.169 --> 38:06.164
I assume it's clear to you now
why we couldn't machinery partner.

38:08.643 --> 38:10.612
I have to be with my client.

38:17.016 --> 38:20.145
Well, there's not much
to tell, really.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.778
We were married for 1 O years...

38:22.887 --> 38:26.291
, and in love for,
we’ll probably half that.

38:26.390 --> 38:29.658
It's probably hard loving a golf bum.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.129
- You want to hear something really awful?
- Taxi!

38:33.228 --> 38:37.760
When we first got married, I knew deep down
that he would never amount to anything.

38:37.867 --> 38:41.600
And somehow, I was okay with that.

38:43.605 --> 38:47.738
So what are your plans now?
You, um, dating?

38:47.841 --> 38:53.283
Occasionally.
Actually, not at all.

38:54.746 --> 38:58.116
Little problem with commitment, huh?
I know the feeling.

38:58.215 --> 39:01.517
I'm, um, not looking
for a long-term relationship either.

39:27.941 --> 39:29.843
What I don't understand is
how he got his hands...

39:29.943 --> 39:35.215
from the cake to Shirley's neck
so quickly.

39:35.314 --> 39:37.648
You know, Denny, I can't actually
talk about this with you...

39:37.750 --> 39:39.810
now that Jerry’s my client.

39:39.918 --> 39:42.185
You aren't really going to
represent him, are you?

39:42.287 --> 39:44.722
- I gave him my word.
- Oh, please.

39:44.822 --> 39:48.056
We're lawyers.
He's a wack job.

39:53.629 --> 39:56.863
By the way, did I tell you?
Bev and I are getting married.

39:59.801 --> 40:01.896
No.

40:03.772 --> 40:08.475
- I would've remembered that.
- Yeah, well-

40:08.576 --> 40:13.813
- She's the one.
- Yes.

40:13.913 --> 40:15.882
She seems like the one.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.922
Congratulations, Denny.

40:26.791 --> 40:32.131
I want to assure you that my impending
nuptials won't change anything between us.

40:32.228 --> 40:35.028
No impact what so ever.

40:39.567 --> 40:43.267
I got to go.
We're registering for flatware.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.559
You stinker!
