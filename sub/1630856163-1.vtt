Are you ready? ♪</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:54.553
Hey, birthday girl! Happy 21st!

00:56.973 --> 00:59.601
Have fun tonight, ladies.
Just remember to make good...

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
choices.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.651
Hey, bottle chick!

01:08.735 --> 01:11.654
Be a sweetheart and grab
another round of these bad boys?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.783
Get it yourself. I only serve VIP.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.244
Ignore her. You guys are very important.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.704
Oh! Beach ball!

01:42.727 --> 01:45.522
- Hurry up. Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.869
There you go.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.457
- <i>Ava, we might have a problem.</i>
- What is it?

02:04.541 --> 02:09.003
My sensors are picking up something.
Got a countdown and heat signature.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.463
Coming from under the pool.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.257
What? How much time?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.219
- Eighty-three seconds and counting.
- That doesn't make sense.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.473
I've got eyes on the target.
Blowing himself up is not his MO.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.601
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.270
MOs change. This guy's a wild card.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.521
Yeah, well so are you.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.899
The hell were you doing
talking to me earlier?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.234
Playing a Vegas douchebag,
like we talked about.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.071
The role you were born to play.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.531
Sixty seconds.

02:37.115 --> 02:37.990
Ready to engage.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.033
Whoo-hoo!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.118
Gomez, look alive.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.537
Copy that.
Target is in the crosshairs.

02:43.621 --> 02:47.249
I can outfit his head with a new hole
on your command. Just say the word.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.544
McKnight, you do not say the word.
Koslov is no martyr.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.797
Killing him does nothing
to stop the threat.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.841
Under a minute means there's no time
to find and deactivate the nuke.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.927
For all we know,
his phone is the detonator.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.721
I have a clean shot.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.432
I can take out his muscle.
No collateral damage.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.560
Except flushing months of work
down the drain.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.062
Do not take that shot.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.980
- That's an order.
- I give my team orders.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.568
And I give you orders.
How the fuck do you not get that by now?

03:20.658 --> 03:22.993
- Twenty seconds.
<i>- Come on, Winters.</i>

03:23.077 --> 03:27.206
We're supposed to stop the bad guy,
not sit here while he blows up Vegas.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.459
He's not blowing up Vegas.
At least not until he's miles away.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.754
- How can you be sure?
- It's my job to be sure.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.297
- Ten seconds.
- Am I going hot or not?

03:35.381 --> 03:38.092
Do not take that shot.
He's a businessman. Not a suicide bomber.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.012
Five, four, three...

03:43.181 --> 03:45.266
Wait!

04:02.158 --> 04:04.326
<i>The signal's tied to the DJ booth.</i>

04:04.410 --> 04:06.579
They must have rigged pyro for the show.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.664
You don't say.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.582
Told you.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.376
Sorry, team.
Tech's a little oversensitive.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.296
Don't sweat it, Tech Chick.
We all make mistakes.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.925
God didn't when he made those abs.

04:20.009 --> 04:23.721
This team can't afford to make mistakes.
Tighten up.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.974
Yes, ma'am. Roger that. Sorry.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.059
I'm going in.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.896
You got out of the water. Warm and cozy.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.948
There she is. The jewel of Las Vegas.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.410
My edges are too soft to be a jewel.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.830
Your Russian is flawless.
Where are you from?

04:49.914 --> 04:51.499
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

04:53.042 --> 04:56.086
My aunt's from
the Zamoskvorechye district, in Moscow.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.714
That explains how your beauty
stands out here.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.425
If you wanna get away,
I'm leaving on my jet tonight.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
Where'd we be going?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.929
Well, that would take the mystery away.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.933
Let's just say you'll be
better off with me than staying here.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.143
Why do you say that?

05:11.269 --> 05:15.523
Something tells me that tonight
the city's going to be dead.

05:19.777 --> 05:23.865
Here, give me your number.
I'll call you when I'm ready to leave.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.203
Don't tell. I could get fired.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.956
Your secret is safe with me.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
Hey, boss...

05:33.124 --> 05:35.376
Our guests have arrived
and are ready to eat.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.253
They are waiting for you.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.797
Let them wait, it's only appetizers.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.717
I'll be on time for the main course.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.640
You guys are no fun.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.687
I must go.
I'll see you tonight.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.646
Definitely.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.273
Georgie!

06:01.986 --> 06:04.238
This is it. Koslov's meeting the buyers.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.865
Gomez, rendezvous out front.
Full tactical pursuit.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.994
No. He feels our surveillance
we'll lose him.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.162
Ivan may be wild, but he's not reckless.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.458
- So, we sit here and do nothing?
- I didn't say we do nothing.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.627
Get the vulture.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.272
Hi!

06:38.356 --> 06:40.482
Whole gang is here, huh?

06:40.566 --> 06:41.734
Apologies for my delay.

06:41.818 --> 06:46.322
Wanted to do the last dance with Las Vegas
before the party is over.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.995
Huh? A thing of beauty, isn't it?

06:54.330 --> 06:57.541
Five kilotons of destructive power.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.917
Enough to level the city,

06:59.001 --> 07:01.629
and also compact enough
to fit in the trunk of your car.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.465
Mobile, undetectable.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.052
All you have to do
is set the timer and fly away.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.306
And in a few hours, the city goes...

07:13.015 --> 07:13.850
poof.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.810
In a mushroom cloud.

07:17.895 --> 07:18.980
It's the real deal.

07:25.862 --> 07:30.074
- The security's in your account.
- Wonderful. Let's celebrate!

07:31.117 --> 07:33.744
And remember our arrangement.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.790
Do not press the button until our plane
is 20,000 feet up in the air.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.501
We'll wait till your flight attendant
has served drinks.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.670
No, she prefers "stewardess."
Pleasure doing business with you.

08:11.199 --> 08:15.703
This is the United States Military.
Everyone put your hands on your heads.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.664
Bitch!

08:23.169 --> 08:24.879
Guess we're doing it the hard way.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.343
<i>Vulture's going hot.</i>

08:46.150 --> 08:48.402
Canister deployed.
It's all yours, McKnight.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.707
Limit your fire.
Winters wants these fuckers alive.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.084
Kill them all, bitch!

09:09.799 --> 09:11.717
Change of plans! Take 'em all down!

09:21.394 --> 09:22.478
Get down.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.196
- Heads or tails?
- Heads.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.114
Phew.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.329
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.212
Oh, fuck.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.726
Motherfucker.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.410
Take him.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.933
- I'm out. Toss me a mag.
- What? No thank you?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.686
<i>East wing clear.
Check the back room.</i>

10:49.565 --> 10:50.691
Winters.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.279
It's Koslov. He has the nuke.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.281
Fuck.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.451
Gomez. Little help?

11:01.535 --> 11:04.246
- No shot. Hang tight a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.831
It's a figure of speech.

11:11.587 --> 11:16.050
Three, two, one, bedtime.

11:25.684 --> 11:26.727
<i>All clear.</i>

11:26.811 --> 11:27.978
You got that right.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.690
He's in one of these rooms.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.825
Clear!

11:48.707 --> 11:49.959
What the fuck?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.629
- Please don't kill me.
- We're the US Government.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.007
- You're okay.
- Looks like someone had a party.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.093
None of that's mine.
I've just been hooking up with this guy.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.930
I don't know if he's a drug dealer.
I don't do that shit. Like, usually.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.309
Relax. We're gonna get you someplace safe.
You just sit tight.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.852
Wait. You're leaving me here?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.610
He must be in here.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.531
We have him cornered.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.326
- He could have an army in there.
- Bring 'em on.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.704
Wait.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.664
This is a vault room.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.668
The door's made of reinforced steel.
You'll break your leg.

12:35.713 --> 12:40.550
Lerner. We have a secure door.
Electronic lock. Can you open it remotely?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.845
You bet. Hang on.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.306
Just finding the right frequency.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.726
- Find it faster.
- Yes, ma'am. That should do it.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.979
You're the tits, Tech Chick.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.356
I'm the tits.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.654
Back away from the bomb. It's over.

13:00.738 --> 13:05.451
Mmm. My little Jewel of Las Vegas.
Well, this is where you are wrong.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.414
I've activated the weapon.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.125
You didn't come this far
to go down with the ship.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.752
No, I didn't.

13:15.336 --> 13:20.090
But if there is no ship,
what's the point of treading water?

13:23.552 --> 13:26.680
He's not bluffing.
Your bomb tech as good as they say he is?

13:27.515 --> 13:28.599
Best in the business.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.518
He better be.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.521
Two more!

13:39.360 --> 13:40.194
Get me Hagerty.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.375
All right.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.253
Let's see this bitch.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.262
Looks like we got a little time.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.061
This puppy's hot.

14:17.773 --> 14:22.486
Detectable C-4. PETN fuse.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.113
This thing's a beaut.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.324
Anybody else getting a half chub?

14:39.420 --> 14:42.089
- What's he doing?
- He's looking for a perfect song.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.468
All bomb guys are weirdos,
but trust me, he's an artist.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.095
Just let him do his thing.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.140
Will you find a song already?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.268
Just relax, sweetheart.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.689
Okay, the whole key to this is just
to forget that there's a clock at all.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.359
So? There's no clock.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.236
There is no--

This guy!

16:14.640 --> 16:15.724
That motherfucker!

16:15.808 --> 16:17.017
- Yeah!
- Yes!

16:17.101 --> 16:18.935
Yes!

16:19.019 --> 16:21.271
Fuck yeah! Yeah!

16:23.857 --> 16:27.360
USA! USA! USA!

16:27.444 --> 16:29.446
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

16:34.618 --> 16:35.660
Yes, baby!

16:35.744 --> 16:37.454
- Great work.
- Thank you.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.584
Look at this motherfucker. Goddamn.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.672
Oh, man. Koslov's in custody.
Bomb deactivated. Crisis averted.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.676
This town should throw us
a goddamn ticker-tape parade.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.179
That was quick.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.807
Ladies, you wanna meet a real American...

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
hero?

17:02.604 --> 17:03.605
What the hell?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.608
A DJ? You gotta be kidding me.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.487
We just saved the world
and this candy ass gets all the love?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.822
- Candy ass.
- That's the world we live in, yo.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.992
Had we streamed our take down on TikTok,
we'd be trending.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.078
No one's ever gonna know what we did.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.582
Because until all this is declassified,
today never happened.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.048
So, what now?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.759
Mission's over.
We go back to the hotel, pack up.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.763
I ship off to Langley, you to Fort Meade,
everyone else to their respective bases.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.307
We disband and await word
of our next assignments.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.851
No. Whoa! Wait, wait, wait.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.729
Fuck that.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.732
We spent months
hunting this son of a bitch.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.986
We finally nabbed the nuke,
we fuck up his whole program,

17:51.070 --> 17:54.323
and we're supposed to just
quietly go our own separate ways?

17:55.657 --> 18:00.496
We're in Las Vegas,
the party capital of the world.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.457
And if the world knew
what we did here today,

18:04.541 --> 18:07.210
they'd want us to party
like the rock stars we are.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.795
Fuck! They'd demand it.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.131
- Fuckin' A, they would.
- Fuck yeah.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.215
2200 hours.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.884
Details TBD, but hear me when I say this.

18:14.968 --> 18:19.973
I am going to empty every cent
that's left in our operational war chest.

18:21.892 --> 18:22.976
Because tonight...

18:24.311 --> 18:28.898
we're gonna show this town
how to celebrate real American heroes.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.817
- Fuck yeah! Yeah!
- Hell yeah!

18:30.901 --> 18:32.444
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

18:32.528 --> 18:33.820
Everyone's invited.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.156
- Ready to get fucked up?
- Ready to get fucked...

18:37.116 --> 18:38.116
up.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.495
What do you say, Winters?
Send your regrets now or ghost us later?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.331
I'll get back to you.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.417
Copy. We won't hold our breath.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.450
<i>Ava Winters.</i>

19:23.203 --> 19:26.373
- Will you be my wife?
- I can't believe this is happening.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.256
Good evening, sir.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.301
Good is an understatement.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.096
I'd call it a pretty damn
fantastic evening.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.100
When you work in our field,
the stakes are always high, but today...

19:46.435 --> 19:47.560
that was historic.

19:47.644 --> 19:51.064
Would have preferred things neater.
The buyer wasn't on our radar.

19:51.148 --> 19:55.735
He's this Swedish blockchain entrepreneur,
who thought he could skyrocket his crypto

19:55.819 --> 19:58.238
by destroying a massive amount
of American currency.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.867
Guy sees one Bond film
and thinks he can be the next Max Zorin.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.162
I'll be on a flight in the morning.
I want to discuss something.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.958
- Winters, no.
- You haven't even heard the brief, sir.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.170
This mission went longer
than you or I could have predicted.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.673
You never had a chance to grieve.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.804
- I'm fine, sir.
- <i>You're taking some time.</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:26.558
<i>The world will still have plenty of trash
to take out when you return.</i>

20:29.686 --> 20:31.188
He would've been proud of you.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.152
I know.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.364
Did you get the President's gift?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.783
Yes. Thank you. It's very generous, sir.

20:43.867 --> 20:47.996
Pop it open.
You're officially on vacation. Enjoy it.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.712
<i>♪ Tonight, I'm gon' be rocking it
Dropping it ♪</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:57.297
<i>♪ Shake my ass, no stopping it... ♪</i>

20:58.966 --> 21:00.092
<i>♪ I look hot in it ♪</i>

21:01.468 --> 21:03.303
<i>♪ Rocking it, dropping it ♪</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:05.054
<i>♪ Shake my ass, no stopping it ♪</i>

21:05.138 --> 21:08.099
<i>♪ I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it... ♪</i>

21:08.183 --> 21:10.185
Yes, Trunky!

21:11.019 --> 21:14.856
You got my end of mission gift! Fits good!

21:15.482 --> 21:17.067
Like a glove! Thanks, chief.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.695
Almost forgot. I got something
for you, too. I hope it fits.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.947
<i>Gracias,</i> this is...

21:22.990 --> 21:23.991
What is this?

21:25.826 --> 21:30.079
Mmm. You crack it like a chem light.
Glows in the dark, can't miss any action.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.540
- Beat you to death with it.
- Watch the face.

21:32.624 --> 21:36.544
That is not what it's used for.
I seen some films showing its proper use.

21:36.628 --> 21:41.091
I'll send you the link.
But now for your real gifts.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.680
Fucking drugs. Purest MDMA in the city.

21:47.764 --> 21:51.517
Knight, I already got gummies in me.
Shouldn't add Molly to the mix.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.896
Molly's a good girl.
She doesn't wanna fuck with gummies.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.190
She just makes 'em dance
like no one's watching.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.149
Fuck it, I'm in.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.317
- You are.
- Yes.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.778
- Here ya go.
- Here we go.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.364
- <i>Gracias.</i> Great.
- <i>Uno mas.</i>

22:04.448 --> 22:06.574
To bad guys and bad bitches.

22:06.658 --> 22:10.328
Beware when the three of us
are on the prowl, you're going down.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.580
Yo, someone's going down. That's for sure.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.749
Boom.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.464
Ooh! Yeah.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.429
Yo, Mac, there's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.222
Kind of personal.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.892
Alpha Sierra Sierra, twelve o'clock,
pillow princess in the crosshairs.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.354
Oh! Bachelorette party. Nice.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.480
Tiara's mine.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.566
The bride?
Groom won't appreciate that too much.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.444
It's like in the field.
Target's in your sights,

22:43.528 --> 22:45.781
forget their personal lives,
or lose your nerve.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.991
Goddamn you're cold-blooded.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.283
She's all yours.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.245
All right, so there's two,
four, six, seven.

22:52.329 --> 22:56.916
- Yeah. Trunk and I'll divvy up the rest.
- Agreed. Engage targets, y'all.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.921
Let's do it. Hey, you in?
We'll talk about that thing later?

23:02.130 --> 23:04.174
Yeah. Let's have some fun. Let's do it.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.594
Honey, death lurks around
every street corner.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.763
No, I'm not being overdramatic.

23:10.847 --> 23:14.934
Prom night is the most dangerous night
for teenage drinking and driving.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.437
Make sure Jen has a limo,
a driver without a record,

23:17.521 --> 23:19.106
and to be home before midnight.

23:22.442 --> 23:25.319
Honey. That's not fair.
You know I wanted to be there.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.780
This mission was important.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.868
What? No, of course, I'm not saying
our daughter's not important. What the...

23:31.952 --> 23:34.203
Hey, Paul's wife, Chad McKnight here.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.623
I just want to say your husband
was a real hero today.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.126
He did some crazy shit.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.839
Why don't we cut the guy some slack,
let him have some fun, huh?

23:44.506 --> 23:47.217
Maybe a couple of lap dances.
Handy at most.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.219
Hello?

23:50.137 --> 23:51.554
She hung up. Fuck, dude.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.473
- Thanks a lot.
- She'll forgive you.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.100
- Stop stressing, have a drink.
- I don't drink.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.352
- Maybe that's your problem.
- Right.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.729
Gotta loosen the fuck up.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.608
Great! Now I'm drenched.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.403
Me too.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.325
Sorry.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.966
Heard you liked to live large, Koslov.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.761
- I made sure to give you our best suite.
- Charming.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.222
Do you happen to know the time?

24:35.473 --> 24:39.186
Time no longer exists for you.
You'll never see the light of day again.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.565
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.791
I must be starting to trip balls
because I see Winters.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.627
Nope, I see her too.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.547
Well, well, well.

25:07.631 --> 25:10.884
Looks like the lone wolf's
come to join the pack. Bud Heavy?

25:11.927 --> 25:14.971
How the hell did you pull this together
on a few hours' notice?

25:15.055 --> 25:17.473
My inexhaustible resourcefulness.

25:17.557 --> 25:21.477
That and Uncle Sam's dime
buys you a lot of Vegas goodwill.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.604
Have you met Joey?

25:23.688 --> 25:26.441
- Oh, my God.
- I rented him from the Tiger King.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.902
Not the one in jail.
I'm not an asshole. The new one.

25:29.986 --> 25:34.699
He said not to spook him though,
these things run like the wind. Don't ya?

25:34.783 --> 25:37.953
- You're a fucking idiot.
- My teachers used to say that.

25:38.495 --> 25:43.416
- Is Hagerty doing cocaine?
- Fuck, no. It's Adderall and ketamine.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.795
With a horse tranq garnish
and a whipp-ed chaser.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.214
Don't you guys get tested?

25:50.298 --> 25:53.259
You know how easy it is to get clean piss?
This is America.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.970
In that case,
keep clean pissing your career away.

25:56.054 --> 25:59.056
Come on, Winters.
You didn't come here to be the fun police.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.269
Hey, take a cue from Tech Chick.
Tech Chick came here to party, right?

26:03.353 --> 26:05.104
Yeah. Party time.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.647
Her name isn't Tech Chick.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.942
Her name is Maya Lerner.
She's been on our team for six months.

26:10.026 --> 26:13.196
Oh, I'm fine with Tech Chick.
Or anything you want to call me.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.075
See? Tech Chick gets it! Love you!

26:21.162 --> 26:24.665
Fuck him. G.I. Jerk-Off wouldn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground

26:24.749 --> 26:26.459
on this mission if it weren't for us.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.795
- Lerner, I need your help with something.
- Yes, ma'am.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.465
I brought my laptop.
"Don't leave home without it."

26:32.549 --> 26:35.427
Forget work.
I need you to help me polish this off.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.096
You want to drink? With me?

26:39.180 --> 26:42.808
- Come on. It's our turn to party.
- Okay.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.195
Fuck it!

27:01.745 --> 27:04.080
You want to melt
those pretty minds of yours?

27:04.164 --> 27:06.290
<i>Psilocybe azurescens,</i>

27:06.374 --> 27:09.835
otherwise known
as flying saucer mushrooms.

27:09.919 --> 27:14.966
Infused with military-grade
lysergic acid diethylamide.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.601
Yeah, you won't be needing this tonight.

27:25.935 --> 27:31.775
What the hell. It's a party, right?
A little pineapple, mixed with guacamole.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.535
Wow!

27:46.289 --> 27:50.585
- Are you feeling it?
- Oh, I'm feeling it. You feeling it?

27:51.544 --> 27:53.629
Oh, I'm definitely feeling it.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.147
Measuring U-235 isotope.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.901
That's odd.

28:17.737 --> 28:22.826
This can't be right. We need to take this
to the top. Where's Hagerty?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.498
That is dope.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.461
Whoa!

28:33.545 --> 28:36.130
Yunga! What's going on, kid?

28:36.214 --> 28:40.509
Ladies, I want you to meet my bestie
in the whole wide world.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.971
This is Captain Paul Yung, USAF,

28:43.805 --> 28:45.598
which stands for "U Silly As Fuck."

28:45.682 --> 28:48.393
Get off your phone
and come join the party.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.605
Hey. There's going to be
some water sports here.

28:53.356 --> 28:54.733
You want to get in on this?

28:56.025 --> 28:57.360
You know I'm married.

28:58.153 --> 29:02.907
And that's why I'm asking you, Paul.
You need this so goddamn bad.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.536
But suit yourself. Okay?

29:07.579 --> 29:11.832
Now go try that guacamole over there.
It's the goddamn bomb.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.839
You're a fucking genius.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.593
You're the youngest recruit
the NSA's ever had.

29:22.677 --> 29:27.265
Yeah. And I spend most of my time
in a dark van decrypting code.

29:28.975 --> 29:32.895
And then I go out in the real world
and I'm clueless.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.273
We're all fucking clueless.

29:35.982 --> 29:39.610
But then, I look at you
and I see the ultimate badass.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.405
- Stop!
- You're smart. You're sexy.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.867
You don't shit from anyone.
You're a fucking boss.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.247
How did you find that confidence?

29:51.331 --> 29:53.333
At some point, I guess I realized...

29:54.334 --> 29:59.631
if you want things to be a certain way,
you can't depend on fate or luck.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.426
Just gotta step up.
Make it happen yourself.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.344
Let's do this.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.477
- Grease him up!
- Ah! All biceps, no brains.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.937
I've got enough brains.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.565
Oh! Part the sea!

30:17.649 --> 30:19.191
Come on, we're fun.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.319
Back it up!

30:26.991 --> 30:29.243
Oh! That is good.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.330
- Ready, big boy?
- Yeah!

30:33.581 --> 30:37.042
Get a couple drinks in him,
sooner or later, someone greases up Trunk.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.754
No one's taken him down
inside of a minute.

30:54.435 --> 30:58.230
McKnight might be
the cockiest son of a bitch I've ever met,

30:58.314 --> 30:59.774
that's why the ladies love him.

31:05.363 --> 31:10.868
- What kinda ladies is McKnight into?
- He'll fuck anything with a pulse.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.746
If we're talking end game,
Ali Larter from <i>Varsity Blues.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:15.456
That's his dream girl.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.710
All right, bring it up.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.511
USA!

31:28.595 --> 31:32.515
USA! USA! USA!

31:32.599 --> 31:36.060
Hey. You do realize
you're both USA, right?

31:36.686 --> 31:39.939
Winters, that was a feat
of Vin Diesel-ian proportions.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.483
Okay? Do not act like you're unimpressed.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.236
You embarrassed yourself for
a full minute, then got lucky.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.243
- You can do it faster?
- That's not what I said.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.286
But obviously, I can.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.167
Oh! Oh! Oh!

32:00.084 --> 32:00.918
Oh!

32:01.002 --> 32:02.837
- He's all yours.
- Oh, thank you.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.884
- Let's see it.
- Hey.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.594
- Can I borrow this?
- Of course.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.221
- You're so pretty.
- Stop.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.641
You sure you want to do this?
It'll get that nice dress all dirty.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.311
Let me worry about the dry cleaning bill.
You focus on staying upright.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.899
Talk that shit, boss.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.111
Yo, watch yourself, Trunk.
That's intelligence coming at you now.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.533
What?

32:38.748 --> 32:40.708
Holy shit, that's gotta be a new record!

32:47.882 --> 32:49.049
USA?

32:49.133 --> 32:51.468
USA! USA! USA!

32:51.552 --> 32:54.096

Jen, I hope you get this message.

33:14.951 --> 33:18.495
My calls are going to voicemail
after only a couple rings.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.290
I just want to say,
I want you to have fun at prom.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.125
Don't let your friends pressure you

33:23.209 --> 33:26.253
into doing anything I wouldn't do.
Okay, sweetheart?

33:26.337 --> 33:30.466
Ali Larter, <i>Varsity Blues.</i>

33:31.968 --> 33:32.802
Oh!

33:47.942 --> 33:49.027
Oh, shit.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.785
Need some help
getting that grease off, big boy?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.328
Back off. He's mine.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.955
- Oh, what the--
- Oh, shit!

34:01.039 --> 34:02.331
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

34:02.415 --> 34:04.249
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Get the fuck out!

34:04.333 --> 34:06.293
- I didn't see anything.
- Get the fuck out!

34:06.377 --> 34:07.462
Shit.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.839
You wanted to talk about this?

34:10.923 --> 34:14.218
- Get the fuck out!
- Fine! I'm out. I'm out! I'm out!

34:15.678 --> 34:16.888
Holy shit.

34:25.980 --> 34:32.195
Hey. Thank God.
No, it's perfect timing. Believe me.

34:32.695 --> 34:36.240
Let me just find some place quiet.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.245
This doesn't add up.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.331
We know that Koslov
had enough uranium to blow the city.

34:44.415 --> 34:48.127
Now the lab is saying the bomb we seized
only has hints of it?

34:48.211 --> 34:49.670
- Where's the rest?
- Sir!

34:51.130 --> 34:52.340
We just got a message.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.468
It's not good.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.096
Gather the joint chiefs.
Situation room, five minutes.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.515
Get in touch with Winters.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.143
We need her now more than ever.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.311
<i>Fuck waking up tomorrow!</i>

35:06.395 --> 35:08.439
Like they say <i>en français...</i>

35:11.984 --> 35:14.695
Let's get fucked up tonight!

35:16.030 --> 35:19.658
It's all good. S'all good. S'all good.
Because you know what?

35:19.742 --> 35:22.661
I'm gonna call room service
and have 'em bring us up some more.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.915
Don't go anywhere.
We gotta exchange numbers. Be right back.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.254
Great to hear your voice, too.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.547
I miss you too.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.094
I'm sorry I left you alone again.
I know that's never easy.

35:39.053 --> 35:43.307
I love you too.
I can't wait to see you, Mom.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.268
Oh, shit.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.519
You should have seen it.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.606
We killed more Russians
than the Wolverines did in <i>Red Dawn.</i>

35:51.399 --> 35:52.650
Obviously, the original.

35:53.693 --> 35:58.239
I told you about Gomez's top-secret rifle,
that can blow a guy's head off from five...

36:00.867 --> 36:06.080
You know what, Mom?
Let's catch up tomorrow. Me too. Bye.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.292
Don't worry. She won't say anything.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.420
Relax. I'm not gonna rat.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.216
Never figured you for a mama's boy.

36:17.967 --> 36:21.637
When your dad takes off when you're six,
it's kind of what happens.

36:25.266 --> 36:29.061
- Not a bad view.
- For 60K a night? Fucking better be.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.731
- You realize it's taxpayer money.
- Schematics.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.650
Come on.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.154
If not for us, all of this would be gone.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.325
Even you have to admit it,
we deserve a little fun.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.034
- Fun?
- Yeah.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.202
Right.

36:45.286 --> 36:49.749
All I can think about are these people
having fun without a care in the world.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.836
- If they knew what we knew.
- They'd be shitting themselves.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.466
That's why they can never know.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.427
It's fucked up when you think about it.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.972
Gotta be a little fucked up
to do this, right?

37:08.059 --> 37:11.687
Yeah. That's what we signed up for.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.814
Somebody's got to answer the call.

37:14.857 --> 37:18.152
Never letting our guard down.
Always on duty.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.280
Not tonight.

37:24.825 --> 37:25.826
No.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.455
Not tonight.

37:30.539 --> 37:34.209
<i>♪ This ain't a misdemeanor
Bitch, this is a felony, uh ♪</i>

37:34.293 --> 37:37.880
<i>♪ I read between the lines
Not buying what you're selling me... ♪</i>

37:37.964 --> 37:39.590
- Are we...
- Shut up.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.846
- Fuck.
- I'll do it.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.765
<i>♪ Headed straight to my floor seats ♪</i>

37:48.849 --> 37:52.228
<i>♪ I'm the gift that keeps on giving

37:57.650 --> 38:01.737
Oh, shit. Looks like you're going commando
in more ways than one.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.823
- I like to let it breathe.
- Oh, fuck.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.211
Here.

38:26.262 --> 38:30.016
Oh, shit. These are regular size.
I'm used to Magnum XL's.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.727
I'm drunk. Not blind. Put it on.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.654
Okay.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.324
Let's not forget who's in command.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.877
- You know I don't take orders well.
- Maybe I should be more forceful.

39:06.594 --> 39:11.056
This is amazing.
You're so fucking amazing. I love you.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.851
I loved you since the first moment
I saw you.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.188
Okay...

39:18.022 --> 39:20.191
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just keep going.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.444
- Do you not feel...
- Just keep going.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.326
- I can't.
- Me neither.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.581
- Look, sorry if I...
- Don't be sorry.

39:36.665 --> 39:40.460
I thought that since the mission was over,
we'd never see each other again.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.879
Now we definitely won't.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.723
Hey, cowboy. I think I've got a cure
for your <i>Varsity Blues.</i>

39:52.807 --> 39:54.182
- What the fuck?
- Lerner!

39:54.266 --> 39:56.351
- Tech Chick.
- What are you doing?

39:56.435 --> 39:58.895
The two of you? What the hell?

39:58.979 --> 40:01.732
- Just take it easy.
- Take it easy?

40:01.816 --> 40:05.193
You've been saying he's nothing
but a meat bag with small dick energy.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.445
You said what?

40:07.571 --> 40:10.574
Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.827
- Oh!
- Jesus Christ.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.872
Oh, fuck. This was a big mistake.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.248
You can say that again.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.250
Says the guy who dropped the L word.

40:20.334 --> 40:24.921
I meant I love that ass.
I'm an ass man. Everyone knows that.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.256
And it's the ecstasy talking.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.467
I said "I love you"
to so many people tonight.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.968
I said it to the fucking camel.

40:30.052 --> 40:33.764
- I'm out of here.
- Lerner, wait.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.601
You know, I actually looked up to you,
but you're full of shit.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.022
That's why you work undercover,
because you're so good at lying.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.483
Bitch.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.361
Wow.

40:47.445 --> 40:51.073
Look at Tech Chick
letting it all hang out. A for effort.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.661
Oh, where's my phone?

40:58.664 --> 41:00.416
What is this?

41:04.503 --> 41:06.922
<i>To those who have Ivan Koslov,</i>

41:07.006 --> 41:11.301
<i>as you have probably now realized,
the bomb you deactivated was a fake.</i>

41:11.385 --> 41:14.096
<i>We still have
the five kiloton nuclear device,</i>

41:14.180 --> 41:18.100
<i>and we will detonate it
unless you release Mr. Koslov.</i>

41:18.184 --> 41:22.104
<i>Any attempt to evacuate the city
will result in immediate detonation.</i>

41:22.188 --> 41:23.689
<i>You have until 9:00 a.m.</i>

41:24.398 --> 41:27.151
<i>If you do not comply,
the city will be obliterated.</i>

41:32.656 --> 41:35.575
- What's that? Some other booty call?
- Fuck!

41:41.415 --> 41:43.542
Hey, hey. You seen McKnight?

41:43.626 --> 41:46.837
He's in the master bedroom
with his dick hanging out. He's all yours.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.714
What did he tell you?

41:49.798 --> 41:52.175
The bomb was fake? We got the nuke, right?

41:52.259 --> 41:53.218
I don't know.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.346
If it's a hoax,
Langdon wouldn't passed it on.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.598
- Shit. This is bad.
- Yeah.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.809
You had to go and throw
this fucking party.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.769
We thought the mission was over.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.355
- God.
- Jesus.

42:05.439 --> 42:08.234
- Someone can't handle their liquor.
- Go fuck yourself.

42:08.817 --> 42:11.070
We have a call with Langdon
in five minutes.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.448
We need to clear this place out.

42:21.455 --> 42:24.333
It's a goddamn shame
we got to break this up.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.090
- Excuse me.
- Hey, where you going, baby girl?

42:35.427 --> 42:39.264
Excuse me, everyone. There's been
an emergency, so we all have to...

42:39.348 --> 42:41.016
Party to the break of dawn!

42:43.602 --> 42:44.603
No.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.275
Party's over! Get the fuck out!

42:49.900 --> 42:52.277
- You got to go.
- All right, let's go.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.530
Go! You gotta go.
Yeah, right now. Go.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.032
Hey, you gotta go!

42:57.116 --> 42:59.618
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- What?

42:59.702 --> 43:02.579
You're getting married.
Billy's gonna be pissed. Let's go!

43:02.663 --> 43:03.830
But I wanna stay!

43:03.914 --> 43:05.999
I'm good. Thank you. Get out of here.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.084
Let's go. Keep moving. Keep moving.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.587
I'm just as sad as you.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.339
- All right. Thank you.
- Got you.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.299
You had so much fun.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.051
What the fuck, Winters? Pussy block much?

43:16.135 --> 43:18.094
SOCOM received a bomb threat.

43:18.178 --> 43:21.473
If we don't release Ivan Koslov,
Las Vegas will be destroyed

43:21.557 --> 43:23.600
by a five kilo-bomb device.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.270
- Kilo-bomb? That sounds bad.
- That's not what I meant.

43:27.354 --> 43:29.981
"Kilo" means 1,000.
So they're saying 5,000 bombs?

43:30.065 --> 43:32.526
- I call bullshit.
- Koslov's people have a nuke.

43:36.071 --> 43:39.699
- This is why I don't drink.
- Oh! Good for you, Paul.

43:39.783 --> 43:42.577
We should all be so fucking boring. Fuck.

43:44.246 --> 43:47.291
Shit. Langdon wants to Zoom.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.589
Fuck. Look at this place.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.091
- The bedroom.
- Come on.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.308
Smells like somebody
got their fuck on in here.

44:05.559 --> 44:08.770
- Nobody got their fuck on in here.
- Somebody fornicated in here.

44:08.854 --> 44:11.648
She couldn't have been that good.
Dude didn't finish.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.984
Probably some limp-dick
with erectile dysfunction.

44:16.862 --> 44:18.113
Oh, shit.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.576
Much better.

44:23.452 --> 44:24.453
Paul.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.543
<i>Good. You're all there.</i>

44:31.627 --> 44:35.463
We've been analyzing the message.
It was sent from within Clark County.

44:35.547 --> 44:37.173
No doubt from a Koslov associate.

44:37.257 --> 44:39.843
<i>What's the threat crebidility?
Credibility.</i>

44:39.927 --> 44:45.849
The lab report on the bomb you retrieved
showed only traces of isotopic uranium.

44:45.933 --> 44:49.436
Just enough to be detected,
but not enough for an explosion.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.855
<i>Highly sophisticated copy.</i>

44:51.939 --> 44:55.859
<i>That means someone working for Koslov
still has the mother lode.</i>

44:55.943 --> 44:59.863
The lab has been trying to get in touch
with your EOD. Is he there with you?

45:01.448 --> 45:02.991
- <i>Hagerty's here.</i>
- Good.

45:03.075 --> 45:06.161
We're gonna need his magic
if this turns out to be as bad as we...

45:07.538 --> 45:10.082
Wait. What is that?

45:15.212 --> 45:18.382
Sorry, someone moved a camel. Statue.

45:19.299 --> 45:23.887
Look, Winters, I know tonight
was supposed to be a celebration.

45:23.971 --> 45:27.557
But as we all know, in our line of work,
we're always on call.

45:27.641 --> 45:31.645
I assume your team celebrated responsibly,
and nobody took things too far.

45:37.943 --> 45:42.572
No, sir, we all celerated...
Celebrated responsibly.

45:42.656 --> 45:46.034
I just want to know,
is your team ready to get back into this?

45:46.118 --> 45:49.287
- Fuck. No.
- Mmm.

45:49.371 --> 45:50.372
Sir...

45:51.748 --> 45:53.416
<i>Ready as a dog in heat, sir.</i>

45:53.500 --> 45:56.669
That's what I like to hear.
Ball's in your court.

45:56.753 --> 45:59.756
You have a little over seven hours.
Find that nuke.

46:03.343 --> 46:07.055
"Ready as a dog in heat?"
Our blood alcohol's through the roof.

46:07.139 --> 46:09.682
You shitheads took drugs.
We gotta stand down.

46:09.766 --> 46:13.353
We do that, who they gonna
replace us with? The fucking FBI?

46:13.437 --> 46:14.729
Fucking FBI sucks.

46:14.813 --> 46:17.315
If they could handle this shit,
they'd be handling it.

46:17.399 --> 46:21.152
- I hate to admit. She has a point.
- Even Paul agrees.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.947
Now I don't care
how fucked up we are, Winters.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.491
We're still the best in the game.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.328
Now, let's fucking finish this.

46:35.250 --> 46:38.837
- Okay. We're back on.
- Let's do this shit.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.046
What do we know?

46:40.130 --> 46:43.675
Koslov sold a fake bomb. But why?

46:43.759 --> 46:45.969
Because he's a lying commie
son of a bitch.

46:46.053 --> 46:48.931
For the last time,
Koslov is not a communist.

46:49.765 --> 46:52.851
He only cares about money, he... Wait.

46:52.935 --> 46:56.062
Our guests have arrived
and are ready to eat.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.355
<i>They are waiting for you.</i>

46:57.439 --> 46:58.774
I love you.

46:59.983 --> 47:02.361
Let them wait, it's only appetizers.

47:03.904 --> 47:06.073
I'll be on time for the main course.

47:07.783 --> 47:11.202
The fake was the appetizer.
Real nuke, the main course.

47:11.286 --> 47:12.829
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.

47:12.913 --> 47:15.331
Koslov could trick the crypto guys
into buying a fake

47:15.415 --> 47:17.041
but only if he had a higher offer.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.085
A second buyer?

47:19.962 --> 47:22.338
It's like selling a bag of oregano
to a teenager

47:22.422 --> 47:24.924
while saving the real deal
for someone more savvy.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.469
- Oh!
- Saw an opportunity to get paid twice.

47:27.553 --> 47:31.347
Okay, where's Lerner?
She needs to pull up the operation files.

47:31.431 --> 47:34.767
- She took off about 20 minutes ago.
- Took off where?

47:35.894 --> 47:37.271
<i>♪ I'm having a ball ♪</i>

47:38.438 --> 47:40.816
<i>♪ I'm running the show ♪</i>

47:42.067 --> 47:44.611
<i>♪ How I got stuck... ♪</i>

47:44.695 --> 47:46.362
Where's my special cheeseburger?

47:46.446 --> 47:48.532
I already told you.
We don't serve food here.

47:49.741 --> 47:52.411
Then what the fuck you call this?

47:53.870 --> 47:58.917
I want my special cheeseburger!
Medium rare, plus extra mayo.

47:59.001 --> 48:02.754
I'm not supposed to say this,
but you've had a little too much to drink.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.006
You've had a little too much to drink.

48:05.090 --> 48:09.094
Just give her the goddamn burger. Okay?
Customer's always right.

48:10.637 --> 48:12.180
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.974
At least one person
in this whole city has my back.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.602
Anytime, girl.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.521
Let me guess, boy trouble?

48:20.856 --> 48:22.524
My boss fucked my crush.

48:23.525 --> 48:24.526
Damn.

48:24.610 --> 48:27.028
I even put on the whipped cream
and everything.

48:27.112 --> 48:28.154
You think that's bad?

48:28.238 --> 48:33.368
My man was supposed to take me to go see
J.Lo at Resorts World. Ghosted me.

48:34.119 --> 48:37.288
The real question is
what are we going to do about it?

48:37.372 --> 48:38.873
What do you mean?

48:38.957 --> 48:44.004
I mean we are two,
hot single women in Vegas.

48:44.755 --> 48:48.383
One of us smells like
a goddamn ice cream sundae.

48:48.467 --> 48:52.012
People ought to be lined up.
It's time we do things our way.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.098
Hey, you want to take a ride with me?

48:56.141 --> 48:57.726
Huh?

49:03.940 --> 49:06.651
Fuck yeah. Ride or die.

49:08.111 --> 49:11.030
Let's do it! You got little titties too.
You can shake 'em.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.241
<i>- You've reached Maya Lerner...</i>
- Damn it.

49:15.243 --> 49:17.870
Someone give me a laptop.
I'll access the files myself.

49:17.954 --> 49:19.081
Yo, <i>mira...</i>

49:19.790 --> 49:22.250
- Your lab partner left her shit.
- Ah!

49:23.335 --> 49:26.213
- About what happened earlier...
- Nothing happened.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.215
Once I access this database,

49:29.299 --> 49:33.094
we'll be able to look at everything
and I'll be able to pare down Koslov...

49:34.304 --> 49:37.432
- Oh shit!
- Oh! Fucking gross, Winters.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.768
- The fuck did you eat?
- I don't think I ate.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.229
There's chunks of food in there.
Is that quesadilla?

49:43.313 --> 49:46.608
There was quesadillas?
No one told me there was quesadillas.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.026
There were no quesadillas.

49:48.110 --> 49:50.361
Uh... Anybody have a mint?

49:50.445 --> 49:52.572
I could go for some quesadillas.

49:53.573 --> 49:55.492
Oh, shit, that may have been drugs.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.036
Fuck the computer.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.704
You want to get that bomb back?

49:59.788 --> 50:02.415
Drag Koslov out of his cell
and beat it out of him.

50:02.499 --> 50:06.794
Koslov is old-school. His father was KGB.
He's not gonna give it up easy.

50:06.878 --> 50:10.548
<i>He was prepared for this,
knew what would happen if we captured him,</i>

50:10.632 --> 50:12.091
<i>he knows what happens next.</i>

50:12.175 --> 50:15.845
<i>So we're all going to need to sober up
real fucking quick.</i>

50:16.888 --> 50:18.806
<i>If the nuke is still out there,</i>

50:18.890 --> 50:23.728
<i>and one of Koslov's men has it,
we're back to square one.</i>

50:23.812 --> 50:25.438
The weapon is ready.

50:25.522 --> 50:28.066
The countdown has begun.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.317
Have you made contact?

50:31.069 --> 50:32.695
I have the NSA op.

50:32.779 --> 50:37.408
What's taking so long?
Get in here, girl!

50:37.492 --> 50:39.161
She doesn't suspect a thing.

50:39.745 --> 50:40.787
Excellent.

50:41.747 --> 50:46.876
Ooh! I hope there's champs in there,
because we getting fucked...

50:46.960 --> 50:47.960
- Up!
- Up!

50:48.962 --> 50:50.714
I already knew. Whoo!

50:55.677 --> 50:58.013
All right, we all need to clear our minds,

50:59.014 --> 51:04.186
forget anything that happened tonight,
and get back on our A-game. ASAP.

51:06.062 --> 51:07.355
Everyone.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.900
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Oh, God.

51:10.984 --> 51:12.402
- Shit!
- Fuck, Hagerty.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.904
Nope.

51:16.865 --> 51:20.494
- Hagerty has left the building.
- Uh, no.

51:21.453 --> 51:23.163
Shit!

51:24.456 --> 51:26.249
- Hagerty?
- Oh, my God.

51:28.960 --> 51:32.506
- Let's go! We got commies to interrogate!
- Let's go! Come on.

51:38.011 --> 51:39.888
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck.

51:42.390 --> 51:43.391
Go!

51:45.560 --> 51:47.311
Everyone strap in!

51:47.395 --> 51:52.775
- Are you sure you're okay to fly?
- Yep, I've got nothing in my system.

51:52.859 --> 51:55.362
Other than an entire bowl
of chips and guac.

51:56.112 --> 51:57.780
