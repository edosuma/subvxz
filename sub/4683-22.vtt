WEBVTT

00:20.100 --> 00:22.866
I'll be back! I am free.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.933
Ha ha ha!

00:54.400 --> 00:55.966
Talk to me.

00:56.033 --> 00:58.700
Or don't talk to me.

00:58.766 --> 01:01.533
But if you and I aren't
gonna communicate somehow

01:01.600 --> 01:04.233
why do you keep bothering
to make this sessions, Dana?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.533
I don't get it.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.700
How are you supposed
to talk about things

01:13.766 --> 01:15.600
that are inside your head?

01:17.333 --> 01:20.133
It can't be that easy.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.133
Sometimes it takes courage

01:22.900 --> 01:24.833
Sometimes you need help.

01:27.266 --> 01:30.200
- Mind if I smoke?
- Yeah.

01:30.266 --> 01:32.600
No, I mean...I don't mind.

01:33.533 --> 01:36.000
It's not good for you.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.200
You're right.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.133
Listen, would it help
if I told you

01:42.200 --> 01:44.133
that I've seen
an analyst myself?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.133
No way.

01:48.933 --> 01:51.933
Only, I don't dig my heels
quite so deep into his couch.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.066
Okay.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.866
'Dana..'

01:59.933 --> 02:02.333
'...we all suffer problems.'

02:02.400 --> 02:04.400
Sometimes if we shine
a little light on them

02:04.466 --> 02:06.433
they cease to be problems.

02:08.766 --> 02:10.233
Come on.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.400
I promise, I won't laugh.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.433
Don't be too sure.

02:19.266 --> 02:21.200
Okay.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.200
Alright.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.133
It's not just girls..

02:29.200 --> 02:31.133
...it's the kind of girls.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.633
I'm just not into..

02:35.700 --> 02:37.633
...the girl next door type.

02:52.866 --> 02:54.833
- Excuse me.
- 'It's alright.'

02:57.333 --> 02:59.300
- Outstanding..
- Shut up.

03:01.566 --> 03:02.800
There she is.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.600
'Stone Fox.'

03:08.800 --> 03:10.966
No lie.

03:11.033 --> 03:13.300
Wicked Witch
Of The Mid-West, you mean.

03:13.366 --> 03:16.233
Just look at her, man.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.400
I hear, she's into Satanism.
Animal sacrifice.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.800
She doesn't own
one stich of clothing

03:20.866 --> 03:23.166
that isn't black, Dana.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.800
I wonder what she's reading.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.666
"Jack The Ripper's
Bedtime Stories"?

03:32.733 --> 03:34.700
Go on.

03:41.066 --> 03:43.400
Uh, hi.

03:43.466 --> 03:44.733
Caitlin, right?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.833
Come to the library often?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.233
Who are you?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Me?

03:55.133 --> 03:56.800
Uh, I'm, uh..

03:56.866 --> 03:58.400
- His name is Dana.
- Yeah.

03:58.466 --> 04:00.600
He was just admiring your, uh

04:00.666 --> 04:02.100
'...costuming.'

04:06.000 --> 04:07.966
Oh, Freddy Krueger, huh?

04:08.033 --> 04:10.066
What do you want?

04:10.133 --> 04:11.066
You're doing
some kind of report?

04:11.133 --> 04:12.100
No.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.166
Then why are you
reading about, uh

04:13.233 --> 04:14.800
creep-o like that for?

04:14.866 --> 04:18.033
Freddy Krueger was a god.
He understood things.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.066
I wouldn't expect
anybody your age to get it

04:21.133 --> 04:22.733
Our age. Our age.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.600
Give me a break, will you? Okay?

04:24.666 --> 04:27.466
Freddy Krueger was Springwood's
biggest closet skeleton.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.600
He killed, I don't know
how many people..

04:29.666 --> 04:32.366
Like I said, I wouldn't expect
you to have a clue.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.033
Nicholas, relax it a notch,
will you?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.066
Oh, sure.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.366
Sure, Miss Neuvo-Gravo-Wavo

04:37.433 --> 04:39.133
thinks that
this glazed dog-nut..

04:39.200 --> 04:41.266
'...is some kind of hero.'

04:41.333 --> 04:44.033
But just look at all
that he did for charity.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.666
- For Freddy's kids.
- Nicholas, chill out.

04:46.733 --> 04:49.533
It's probably for some class.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.533
As if it's any of your business.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.966
Yeah.

04:53.033 --> 04:55.233
Lifestyles of the dead
and perverted.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.333
Does your friends mommy always
let him out without a leash?

05:01.466 --> 05:03.400
Excuse me.

05:04.966 --> 05:08.066
Uh, believe me. Okay?

05:08.133 --> 05:10.400
I don't really know this guy.

05:15.966 --> 05:17.000
Dweeb!

05:17.066 --> 05:18.633
- 'Quiet!'
- Oh. Gee!

05:18.700 --> 05:21.566
I wondered why
she was alone all the time

05:21.633 --> 05:23.900
I cannot believe
what she just did to me.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.000
Oh, God!

05:26.066 --> 05:28.000
Classic psycho witch.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.733
You know,
I've seen this type before

05:29.800 --> 05:32.633
It's a typical junior hung up
on a senior syndrome.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.966
She is gorgeous, man.

05:36.033 --> 05:39.700
She is bad news
at 6:00 and 11:00.

05:41.933 --> 05:44.500
I don't even know
why I walked up to her.

05:44.566 --> 05:46.000
Face it, Dana.

05:46.066 --> 05:48.833
The Witch Of The West
has got you under her spell.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.433
Knowledge is power.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.200
But there are some girls
you just

06:09.266 --> 06:11.566
shouldn't go to pieces over.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.900
What attracted you to that sort
of girl do you think?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.033
How should I know?

06:29.100 --> 06:31.033
I'm supposed to be
at the mercy

06:31.100 --> 06:33.033
of my teenage hormones,
remember?

06:36.433 --> 06:38.400
Well, she's a, um..

06:40.633 --> 06:42.566
...mysterious.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.600
She's hard to get.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.466
I don't want things
to come too easy.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.266
'This isn't a thing
we're taking about.'

06:51.333 --> 06:53.333
Or possession.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.233
We're talking
about a live person.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.966
Tell me, do you ever fantasize

07:00.033 --> 07:02.600
winning her somehow?

07:02.666 --> 07:04.500
- That chivalry stuff?
- Mm-hmm.

07:06.033 --> 07:08.033
Yeah, you could put it that way.

07:10.466 --> 07:12.566
All I do..

07:12.633 --> 07:14.566
...is think about her.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.833
But I spend more time
dreaming about her..

07:18.633 --> 07:21.300
...than I do thinking about her
when I'm awake.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.833
And are the dreams enjoyable?

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
'Yeah, to a point.'

07:25.966 --> 07:27.900
But then, they always get..

07:29.900 --> 07:32.133
...really weirded out.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.700
Dana!

08:05.733 --> 08:07.633
Dana!

08:15.133 --> 08:17.066
He's after me.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.033
- Who is after you?
- You know.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.533
Him. Freddy.

08:22.933 --> 08:26.366
'Caitlin's heart for Freddy.'

08:26.433 --> 08:29.000
'Caitlin's heart for Freddy.'

08:29.066 --> 08:30.500
Come on.

08:30.566 --> 08:33.400
I'll get us out of here.

08:33.466 --> 08:34.966
Don't worry.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.533
This is the way out.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
Go.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.300
Caitlin?

09:00.066 --> 09:02.900
'Dana.'

09:04.100 --> 09:06.033
Caitlin, is that you?

09:07.133 --> 09:09.066
Where are you?

09:09.133 --> 09:10.400
Ah!

09:10.466 --> 09:13.133
Ah, naughty, naughty.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.133
Sneaking Sally
to the graveyard, huh?

10:01.566 --> 10:03.700
Oh, five minutes
to first period. Splendid.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.333
Do you ever talk about these

10:25.400 --> 10:27.400
dreams with any
of your friends?

10:28.633 --> 10:29.800
Well, I've tried

10:29.866 --> 10:32.200
with my buddy Nicholas.

10:32.266 --> 10:36.200
But, uh, we're all sort of
trapped in the same boat.

10:38.033 --> 10:42.366
I mean, you ever try to talk sex
stuff with the teenage boy?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.633
No.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.100
Alright, see you later.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.533
Bye.

10:59.133 --> 11:02.500
Seriously, dude, a 69 on a pop
quiz ain't the end

11:02.566 --> 11:05.566
in a world that will always need
manual laborers.

11:05.633 --> 11:08.166
- Sleep was hell last night.
- Oh, let me guess.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.633
Couldn't sleep with thoughts
of Miss Grave Wave, huh?

11:12.266 --> 11:14.733
I woke up choking.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.733
Couldn't breathe.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.966
The headphone cord
was wrap around my neck.

11:21.033 --> 11:23.000
- But in the dream--
- I can just see it now.

11:23.066 --> 11:26.166
Springwood dork strangled
by homicidal head phones.

11:26.233 --> 11:27.533
'Nicholas, would you please--'

11:27.600 --> 11:29.800
I know, I know. get off your
back. Get off your back.

11:29.866 --> 11:32.100
Your back
ain't the problem, pal.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.800
Getting what's-her-name
over there onto hers is.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.300
I thought, you said
you didn't like her.

11:38.366 --> 11:40.700
I never said I didn't like her.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.733
She's just on another planet.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.600
But the silhouette.

11:48.066 --> 11:50.733
She never lies.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.333
No strain, my friend.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.333
I have the thing you need.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.300
Seriously, dude.

11:58.366 --> 12:00.366
Whenever you say "seriously"
like that

12:00.433 --> 12:02.066
I know I'm a deep chocolate.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.100
Here is it.

12:07.566 --> 12:09.533
Oh, God.

12:11.266 --> 12:12.566
So this is where you
get all your

12:12.633 --> 12:14.866
so called "Sex expertise", huh?

12:14.933 --> 12:16.933
Yeah. Go on.
No, feel free. Go on, doubt me.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You know I think you all talk&nbsp;
amigo, you know that?

12:19.066 --> 12:21.900
And I don't think
that you have actually really..

12:23.200 --> 12:26.366
You know...done it.

12:26.433 --> 12:28.400
Oh. Of course I have.

12:30.466 --> 12:33.000
Oh, sure, I had that.
Absolutely.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.000
Look i-it's no biggie,
dude, okay?

12:38.400 --> 12:42.766
That is I, uh..
You know, I almost had it.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.800
No, I mean, I-I-I have gon
all the way, but just..

12:46.866 --> 12:48.833
...well, not strictly
technically.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.600
Everything...but the actual..

12:51.666 --> 12:54.200
Nicholas.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.033
Well, Suki let me perform a-a
tactical R and R on her once.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.600
Kind of.

13:01.666 --> 13:05.066
"Ultimate turn on techniques
to make her your slave."

13:05.133 --> 13:08.766
Yeah, whatever. Look, it's
a very good book, okay?

13:08.833 --> 13:10.033
Read it for beddy-bye time

13:10.100 --> 13:13.233
- Listen, I gotta dash.
- Where the hell are you going?

13:13.300 --> 13:15.933
Suki, uh, is working
at the Cheesy Boy.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.166
Today I think I'll, um,
run over there

13:18.233 --> 13:21.466
and tear me off a piece...
of pizza.

13:21.533 --> 13:24.866
You, of course, my friend,
are invited to come over.

13:24.933 --> 13:26.466
Suki, Nicholas?

13:26.533 --> 13:29.466
Suki's the one that choose that
watermelon flavored bubblegum.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.800
Woof woof.

13:30.866 --> 13:32.666
You're loss and my gain,
pal, alright?

13:32.733 --> 13:34.200
Just check out the book.

13:34.266 --> 13:36.766
And maybe tonight

13:36.833 --> 13:38.933
one of us will get horizontal.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.866
Trust me on this one.

13:40.933 --> 13:43.533
Yeah. Seriously.

14:02.366 --> 14:04.633
Doing a book report?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.966
Every time I'm around her..

14:12.033 --> 14:14.500
...I turn into a total geek.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.433
But in the dreams...it's better.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.233
Because I-I don't have to worry

14:23.300 --> 14:27.066
about...being a nerd.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.900
So why not let your dreams
have their head?

14:29.966 --> 14:31.900
Let them run loose.

14:31.966 --> 14:34.566
Turn them up to eleven.

14:34.633 --> 14:38.566
Teenagers are supposed to have
a rich and active fantasy life.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.833
- Aren't they?
- Yeah, but..

14:40.900 --> 14:42.833
- But?
- 'But I'm afraid.'

14:43.800 --> 14:46.200
That if-if I wound up with her..

14:47.766 --> 14:49.033
...she'd be too much for me.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.200
So you're afraid
that you'll get her.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.066
And you're afraid
that you won't get her.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.466
Dana, you've got
to make up your mind

14:56.533 --> 14:59.433
and decide what you want.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.266
'"How to make a woman
want you?"'

15:07.800 --> 15:10.400
"You, yes, you,
have it within your power

15:10.466 --> 15:12.133
"to attract a girl
of your dreams

15:12.200 --> 15:16.533
anytime, anywhere,
in any social situation."

15:19.866 --> 15:23.766
"Simply picture in your mind
the girl you want.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.700
"Your ideal love mate

15:26.766 --> 15:28.733
the woman for you."

15:55.500 --> 15:57.433
Yeah, that's terrific.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.000
Except I wish
she wouldn't wear the wardrobe

15:59.066 --> 16:01.533
of the living dead so much.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.900
Easiest thing
in the world to fix.

16:14.466 --> 16:16.733
There. How's that? Better?

16:22.166 --> 16:24.500
Anything else
you'd like me to change?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.033
Ah.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.133
I always wondered
what you look like as a blonde.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.266
Nobody wearing this many clothes
can be comfortable.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.100
Is it something I said?

17:28.166 --> 17:29.566
No, no, no, I'm okay.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.600
I mean, uh,
we just have to wait..

17:33.166 --> 17:34.433
...a little bit.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.000
Dude, you're not making

17:36.066 --> 17:38.000
your Uncle Nicholas
a proud puppy here.

17:38.066 --> 17:40.833
You're blowin' it, pal.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.400
Dana, dear, I think
you're going to have

17:42.466 --> 17:44.233
to ask your friend to leave.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.533
Kiss off, Mummy Damndest

17:46.600 --> 17:47.800
He's mine.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.233
'Oh, I never heard such a..'

17:52.733 --> 17:54.866
You lack proper manners,
young lady.

17:54.933 --> 17:56.933
You're not right for my son.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.900
I'm afraid you're going to have
to eat a hollow point.

17:59.966 --> 18:03.533
Butt back into the kitchen
Mummy Damndest.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.433
I think something's burning.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.866
Have hard time finding me?

18:25.933 --> 18:28.966
Oh, red hair this time. Great.

18:29.033 --> 18:31.933
Red's the color of lust,
you know.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.066
Maybe you don't know.

18:33.133 --> 18:35.400
You are the color
of totally insane.

18:35.466 --> 18:37.600
You just inhaled my mom down
into a smoke ring!

18:37.666 --> 18:40.500
I want out of here.
This is not happening.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.433
You and me..

18:46.566 --> 18:49.233
...we're gonna make it happen.

18:52.766 --> 18:54.833
Red Big Bob Velcro.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.300
It just rips right off

18:57.366 --> 19:00.333
when you're ready
to rock and roll!

19:08.433 --> 19:09.733
'You didn't get it,
the part where it says'

19:09.800 --> 19:12.900
"Opportunities are literally
all around you right now."

19:14.733 --> 19:16.700
Poor baby.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.433
You're scared to death,
aren't you, huh?

19:29.533 --> 19:32.000
This really is your first time?

19:35.033 --> 19:37.466
Well, don't you worry.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.833
I'll do all the doing.

19:41.133 --> 19:44.533
This is gonna be the stuff
dreams are made of.

19:49.633 --> 19:52.533
- Oh my God.
- 'Confused?'

19:53.566 --> 19:55.600
Let me give you
a helping hand.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.733
'Wake up.'

20:06.800 --> 20:08.900
You know I don't like it
when you do things in here

20:08.966 --> 20:10.933
with the door..

20:18.333 --> 20:20.900
Oh, no.. It's..

20:20.966 --> 20:23.033
Oh.

20:31.333 --> 20:34.700
Oh, the first time..

20:34.766 --> 20:37.300
You never forget..

20:37.366 --> 20:39.300
...if you live!

21:40.633 --> 21:44.133
Man, if this is how many people
show up to remember me..

21:44.200 --> 21:46.333
...I ain't gonna bother dying.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.100
It's a school day.

21:48.166 --> 21:51.233
God forbid we're not
at the football practice.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.100
'Well, now, if it isn't
Freddy Krueger's girlfriend?'

21:57.100 --> 21:59.033
Freddy who's girlfriend?

21:59.100 --> 22:02.300
I was in the library with Dana
just before he died.

22:02.366 --> 22:03.866
She was in there
spouting off all this crud

22:03.933 --> 22:06.033
about how wonderful Freddy was.

22:06.100 --> 22:09.100
'She's major league hung up
on a full-blown lunatic.'

22:09.966 --> 22:11.000
So?

22:11.066 --> 22:14.133
So...so Dana was hung upon her.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.800
Hang here a sec, will you?

22:20.933 --> 22:23.000
What are you doing here?

22:23.066 --> 22:25.200
Getting off
on-on all the black clothing?

22:25.266 --> 22:26.533
A little death chicque?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.100
I'm sorry your friend died

22:29.166 --> 22:30.200
Oh, how nice.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.100
You know,
I-I'm really very touched.

22:33.933 --> 22:36.566
And what might this be?

22:37.933 --> 22:39.933
Ah, yes.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.733
Should have known
you'd bring your main squeeze

22:43.800 --> 22:45.833
to such a jolly social event.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.500
You have no right.

22:47.566 --> 22:50.100
Get real, will you? And what
the hell is wrong with you?

22:51.933 --> 22:54.233
There's nothing to admire
i-in a creep like that.

22:54.300 --> 22:57.633
You don't know.
You can't know.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.800
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute.

22:58.866 --> 23:00.000
Don't touch me!

23:00.066 --> 23:02.566
Have you ever been touched?

23:02.633 --> 23:05.033
I mean, by any guy with a pulse?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.933
Have a nice day.

23:10.866 --> 23:13.866
Christ! What a lunatic.

23:13.933 --> 23:16.833
- Can we go, Nicholas?
- Yeah, sure.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.833
Just stop staring at her.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.466
Boy meets girl.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.033
Girl wants Freddy.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.733
Freddy wants blood

23:40.800 --> 23:43.466
'cause I never go steady.

23:43.533 --> 23:46.500
I'm just not that kinda guy.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.666
Can you tell me
anything about Fred Kruege

23:54.733 --> 23:57.266
I don't already know Caitlin?

23:57.333 --> 23:58.833
God knows I had
to psycho-analyze

23:58.900 --> 24:02.500
enough of his victims' parents.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.133
it's you I need
to know more about.

24:06.966 --> 24:08.933
I don't see the connection..

24:09.000 --> 24:11.166
...or the attraction.

24:11.233 --> 24:13.666
You seem a civil and pleasant
enough person to me.

24:13.733 --> 24:15.666
So, what gives?

24:15.733 --> 24:19.300
Why deliberately paint
yourself as an outcast?

24:19.366 --> 24:22.300
Sunshine and sweetness
just aren't on my menu, doctor.

24:23.466 --> 24:27.066
Does being normal
scare you that much?

24:27.133 --> 24:29.700
It doesn't scare me..

24:29.766 --> 24:31.433
...at all.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.433
I beg your pardon.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.533
I guess that's why you're
being so defensive then, huh?

24:37.766 --> 24:39.733
If you say so.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.233
I don't wanna be normal.

24:44.300 --> 24:47.266
Not if it means
being bland, no risks.

24:47.333 --> 24:51.200
You need a little danger in life
for it to qualify as living.

24:51.266 --> 24:54.100
Hmm. Danger.

24:54.166 --> 24:55.933
I guess, you identify
with Fred Krueger.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.233
No, wait. Wait. Would you wait?

25:07.300 --> 25:10.033
Look, I'm sorry, okay, about
the other day at the funeral.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.833
I was, uh...rude to you.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.000
Where's your little girlfriend?

25:16.066 --> 25:18.033
The gum chewer.

25:19.266 --> 25:21.700
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.
She's just, uh..

25:21.766 --> 25:23.833
Target of opportunity?

25:23.900 --> 25:27.133
Look, I just came here
to apologize to you.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.466
Now, I'm being rude.

25:29.533 --> 25:31.000
I apologize.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.900
Listen, umm, I was just
wondering if may--

25:35.966 --> 25:37.933
No, you're going to ask me out.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.933
It won't work. No.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.866
What do you mean?

25:42.933 --> 25:44.866
It's happened before.

25:44.933 --> 25:46.866
It's always a disaster.

25:46.933 --> 25:49.100
I know what people
here think of me.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.766
No.

25:50.833 --> 25:51.866
Why?

25:51.933 --> 25:53.333
Oh, why, because of this stuff?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.333
Because of Freddy?

25:57.133 --> 25:59.233
No, I'm not sick.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.400
'No, I'm not a twist-o.'

26:02.466 --> 26:05.133
Look, in this world
there are wolves

26:05.200 --> 26:07.700
'and there are sheep.'

26:07.766 --> 26:10.466
Fred Krueger was a predator.

26:10.533 --> 26:11.766
He was a wolf.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.933
Yeah, but, uh, Caitlin,
he was also a psychopath.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.700
Fred Krueger had power.

26:17.766 --> 26:19.900
The power to make
people fear him.

26:19.966 --> 26:22.800
'I see how people look at me
when I walk down the hall.'

26:22.866 --> 26:25.800
I want that power.

26:28.100 --> 26:30.033
What for?

26:30.100 --> 26:32.100
Better than being a sheep.

26:32.866 --> 26:35.033
Yeah., so, uh..

26:35.100 --> 26:37.033
Does this mean no?

26:38.200 --> 26:40.166
Come on.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.200
You're too young for me.

26:43.266 --> 26:45.266
Okay, next excuse.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.800
Come on, we'll go-we'll go
to the overlook, okay.

26:47.866 --> 26:49.833
We'll talk, no alcohol.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.900
No groping, just talk.

26:51.966 --> 26:53.933
I promise.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.466
Come on.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.533
Hey, I don't make
an offer like this every day.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.933
Don't be afraid.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.133
I am not scared.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.733
Well, I am.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.500
Because, umm..

27:17.566 --> 27:19.533
Because I like you.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.833
Maybe.. Tsk, I don't know.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.833
I ought to go.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.133
Maybe.

27:37.466 --> 27:39.633
Maybe.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.633
Maybe.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.766
'You just heard
"Baby You Carve My Heart"'

29:06.833 --> 29:08.500
'by Giant Human Sandwich.'

29:08.566 --> 29:10.333
'Next up. Request time.'

29:10.400 --> 29:11.666
'This one's for Caitlin'

29:11.733 --> 29:13.233
'the girl with the funny name.'

29:13.300 --> 29:15.766
'The lady shunned by any guy
with good sense.'

29:15.833 --> 29:17.600
'I say, the&lt;T
with the mostest'

29:17.666 --> 29:19.900
'who damn well,
better not try to change'

29:19.966 --> 29:22.100
'her depressing, morbid life
by stepping out with that'

29:22.166 --> 29:24.166
'lame no-neck
spud-boy Nicholas.'

29:24.233 --> 29:27.500
'Because if she does,
she'll be one dead meat chick.'

29:27.566 --> 29:29.133
'Here's "Do My Will Or Else"'

29:29.200 --> 29:30.566
'by the "Janitors Of Anarchy".'

29:30.633 --> 29:32.666
'A special request for Caitlin'

29:32.733 --> 29:35.000
'with love from Freddy.'

29:52.333 --> 29:56.433
It was on the radio.
It was an actual voice.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.633
So, a warning from Fred Krueger.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.500
I've seen this sort
of thing before.

30:02.333 --> 30:05.533
No. You don't understand.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.900
It didn't start until
after Nicholas asked me out.

30:09.966 --> 30:11.400
See?

30:11.466 --> 30:13.400
You're blocking.

30:13.466 --> 30:16.166
You know the background
on Fred Krueger

30:16.233 --> 30:17.966
and that's what
your sub-conscious mind

30:18.033 --> 30:19.700
is using as raw material

30:19.766 --> 30:21.433
to negatively reinforce yo

30:21.500 --> 30:23.533
against a perfectly normal date.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.433
A date?

30:25.500 --> 30:27.866
And the auditory hallucinations
will be followed by

30:27.933 --> 30:31.400
the visual hallucinations
which will seem just as real.

30:31.466 --> 30:34.366
Believe me, you can very easily
get sucked into your own

30:34.433 --> 30:36.666
fantasy world if you don't
leave yourself enough foothold

30:36.733 --> 30:38.700
in the real world.

30:40.266 --> 30:42.833
Fred Krueger has become
the personification

30:42.900 --> 30:44.833
of your own self-doubt.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.200
As I said..

30:49.266 --> 30:51.500
...I've seen this sort
of case before.

30:53.633 --> 30:55.600
How'd it turn out
for the patient?

31:09.266 --> 31:12.033
Uh, hey, not so grabby.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.666
Somebody will see us.

31:13.733 --> 31:16.833
Come on, Suk, this
is the Asian culture section.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.833
Nobody ever comes back here.

31:20.066 --> 31:22.900
You're not gonna be
the first, buckaroo.

31:24.933 --> 31:27.200
See you in Biology, Nicholas.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.500
"Chapter 13..

31:43.566 --> 31:46.100
The raw animal magnetism."

31:48.333 --> 31:50.433
Raw owl manure.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.333
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.900
Hm, pretty unexpected, huh

31:54.600 --> 31:55.800
Yeah.

31:55.866 --> 31:57.600
Hey, does this mean,
we're on for the overlook?

31:59.100 --> 32:02.100
You, me.. Tonight?

32:02.166 --> 32:04.100
Why wait till tonight?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.433
Nicholas..

32:18.433 --> 32:21.200
...I can't wait till tonight.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.533
''Cause at this very moment'

32:24.600 --> 32:28.500
I've got you right
where I want you.

32:29.866 --> 32:32.500
What the hell is this?

32:32.566 --> 32:36.266
Nicholas, you can be wittier
than that, can't you?

32:36.333 --> 32:38.466
After all,
that is your specialty..

32:38.533 --> 32:41.033
...snide remarks.

32:41.100 --> 32:44.833
Miss Grave Wave,
The Wicked With Of The Mid-West.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.000
I didn't mean it.

32:46.066 --> 32:48.600
I think you are
incredibly attractive.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.266
Big night for firsts,
spud-boy.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.033
It's time you've
had your first shave.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.133
'It'll make you a man.'

32:56.200 --> 32:57.666
Excited?

32:57.733 --> 32:59.433
I'd really rather not.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.100
No, wait. No, don't.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.366
This cannot be real.

33:05.433 --> 33:08.333
It's only a movie, only a movie.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.866
I want my money back.

33:09.933 --> 33:11.733
I don't care if I'm a virgin.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.700
- I want--
- Too late for what you want.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.300
You're nuts.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.100
You and all the rest
of the spuds at school

33:26.166 --> 33:29.733
think I am some kind
of black magic pervert.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.600
Look at yourself, Nicholas.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.033
'Who has power now?'

33:38.100 --> 33:40.033
'Who's the freak now?'

33:41.000 --> 33:43.633
Let me go.
Please, look, I'm sorry.

33:46.266 --> 33:49.300
Sorry is all you've ever been.

33:50.533 --> 33:53.166
Time to take a big spin

33:53.233 --> 33:57.533
on the wheel of misfortune.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.800
I'm afraid I have to cancel
our date for the evening.

34:00.866 --> 34:03.100
I have a previous engagement.

34:04.033 --> 34:07.166
No. No! No!

34:09.466 --> 34:11.433
Stop! Please stop! Help!

34:12.233 --> 34:14.166
'No-o-o!'

34:14.233 --> 34:16.166
'Help! Help!'

34:16.233 --> 34:18.433
Someone help me, please!

34:33.266 --> 34:36.800
Oh, Nicholas..

34:46.400 --> 34:48.600
All dressed up..

34:48.666 --> 34:50.933
...and nowhere to die.

34:56.366 --> 34:58.333
Ah!

35:03.166 --> 35:06.533
Oh, my God. Too much

35:06.600 --> 35:08.533
Much too much.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.366
Jealousy..

35:12.433 --> 35:15.100
I would have never
expected that from you.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.766
'Hello, is this Caitlin?'

35:37.833 --> 35:39.800
'Hi. Are-are you there?'

35:40.933 --> 35:42.933
- Who is this?
- It's me.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.133
You know, Nicholas.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.933
Nicholas?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.500
Oh, Nicholas.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.566
I thought you might be
somebody else.

35:51.633 --> 35:54.933
'Nah, I might be somebody else.'

35:55.000 --> 35:57.100
'You're never alone
with a schizophrenic.'

35:58.366 --> 36:02.600
Uh, listen, um,
I thought I'd give you a buzz.

36:02.666 --> 36:05.033
Maybe ask about going up
to the overlook with me again.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.266
How'd you get my phone number?

36:07.333 --> 36:10.000
Deceit, subterfuge.

36:10.066 --> 36:11.800
Phone book.

36:11.866 --> 36:13.333
You know,
you don't sound so great.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.100
Nicholas, um, you're a really
nice guy and everything but

36:16.166 --> 36:18.100
I don't think I should go
out with you.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.266
I have something else
I got to take care of first.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.500
Well, what is it?
Look, Can I help, um?

36:22.566 --> 36:24.433
Listen, I-I-I'll come right
over, okay.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.833
No, no, don't come over.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.300
I can't..

36:27.366 --> 36:29.700
I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

36:29.766 --> 36:32.533
- What!
- Nothing, I can't. Goodbye.

36:51.133 --> 36:55.566
It was actual blood
on my sketchbook.

36:55.633 --> 36:57.566
Real blood.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.300
Just as I said.

36:59.366 --> 37:03.000
The visual phase
of the hallucinations.

37:03.066 --> 37:06.800
It was real enough
to stay in my sheets.

37:06.866 --> 37:09.166
Hmm. Stigmata then.

37:09.233 --> 37:11.400
Auto-suggestion, interesting.

37:11.466 --> 37:14.633
The mind is capable of tricking
you in ways you'd never suspect.

37:17.333 --> 37:20.633
Freddy is making contact.

37:21.566 --> 37:23.566
Isn't that what you wanted

37:23.633 --> 37:26.000
Yes. No.

37:26.066 --> 37:29.233
I mean, yes it is. But it's
not the way I wanted it.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.700
It's not what I expected.

37:31.766 --> 37:34.333
I thought Freddy and I
were alike.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.166
But in the dream..

37:38.233 --> 37:40.600
...I just wanted to scare
Nicholas away.

37:40.666 --> 37:43.366
Freddy killed him.

37:43.433 --> 37:46.333
A palpable expression
of your own deep-rooted fear

37:46.400 --> 37:49.100
of having a normal date
with a normal guy.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.800
- You see?
- No.

37:50.866 --> 37:53.333
ItisFreddy.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.366
Somehow, it's Freddy for real.

37:56.433 --> 37:57.766
Caitlin.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.133
It's your interpretation
of Fred Krueger.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.533
I suggest that if you
want him out of your dream

38:03.600 --> 38:07.066
you are imminently capable
of evicting him yourself.

38:07.133 --> 38:10.200
And I'm sure to dream
about him again tonight.

38:10.266 --> 38:12.600
By all means. Dream him.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.933
Push this thing all the wa
to its conclusion

38:16.000 --> 38:18.100
and be done with it.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.233
Thank you, doctor.

38:26.466 --> 38:29.133
I think I know
what has to be done.

38:37.300 --> 38:42.200
"Fundamentals Of
Dream Programming."

38:42.266 --> 38:44.566
Okay, Mr. Fred Krueger.

38:44.633 --> 38:47.333
Let's see if you
can handle Miss Caitlin.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.133
Time to grow up.

40:18.133 --> 40:19.333
'So much for the tunes.'

40:19.400 --> 40:21.500
'Now, for the scene
of our town.'

40:21.566 --> 40:25.033
'Over at Springwood High today,
the unstoppable Red and Green'

40:25.100 --> 40:27.966
'scooped up another
six promising young lives'

40:28.033 --> 40:29.866
'in agony and disfigurement'

40:29.933 --> 40:32.566
'making the score,
Grim Reaper, 640'

40:32.633 --> 40:34.700
'Springwood High, zero!'

40:35.500 --> 40:36.966
Ah!

40:57.966 --> 40:59.433
Ah!

40:59.500 --> 41:02.633
Okay, wise-ass,
if I can get this thing started

41:02.700 --> 41:03.900
I'm out of here.

41:06.933 --> 41:08.600
No!

41:08.666 --> 41:12.300
I'm not afraid
of a little blo-o-od!

41:19.300 --> 41:22.166
Having a little trouble
up here, ma'am?

41:22.233 --> 41:25.200
Surprised to see a single lady
up here at this time of night.

41:25.266 --> 41:26.866
Flying solo.

41:26.933 --> 41:28.933
Dressed the way you're and all.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.766
I'm supposed to be
meeting somebody.

41:31.833 --> 41:34.033
Yeah, sure.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.466
Well, now..

41:35.533 --> 41:37.600
...I just can't imagine

41:37.666 --> 41:40.100
what kind of person you'd
be having a rendezvous with

41:40.166 --> 41:42.033
up her in the dark.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.200
I'm...I'm supposed to be--

41:44.266 --> 41:46.266
Is this your vehicle?

41:46.333 --> 41:48.733
I better see some vehicle
registration damn fast

41:48.800 --> 41:50.400
if it is, honey.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.433
I can't.
I don't think I have any.

41:54.766 --> 41:57.500
Well, then I suggest to keep
your hands in the air

41:57.566 --> 42:00.466
where I can see 'em.

42:00.533 --> 42:04.400
It's about time you climbed out
for a little poke and pat.

42:04.466 --> 42:08.000
I can't do that.
My seatbelt won't come undone.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.033
Oh.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.433
I can help you with that
there seatbelt.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.433
Sorry, I'm late.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.466
Still love me?

42:17.533 --> 42:20.833
Let's make mouth music, baby.

42:31.266 --> 42:32.366
'Caitlyn.'

42:32.433 --> 42:34.833
Come on, pick up the phone.

42:36.900 --> 42:40.500
The phonebook doesn't
have your address.

42:40.566 --> 42:42.500
Damn!

42:42.566 --> 42:44.166
Okay.

42:44.233 --> 42:47.500
Alright, where to start?
Where to start?

42:47.566 --> 42:49.700
She walks to school.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.466
Hang on. Hang on.
You can't come in here.

43:07.533 --> 43:08.500
What happened to her?

43:08.566 --> 43:09.766
- You know her?
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:09.833 --> 43:11.600
She's a friend of mine, alright.
What happened to her?

43:11.666 --> 43:15.333
Heart failure induced by
an overdose of barbiturates.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.400
- Heart failure?
- Hey.

43:16.466 --> 43:17.700
'You're not supposed
to touch that.'

43:17.766 --> 43:20.033
Oh, this is great.
Chalk up another death junkie.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.900
This is great.

43:21.966 --> 43:25.100
Hmm. Self-mutilation
and everything.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.366
What're you talking about
self-mutilation?

43:27.433 --> 43:29.033
Check it out.

44:03.866 --> 44:04.933
Remember..

44:05.000 --> 44:07.400
...if love is the drug..

44:07.466 --> 44:10.833
...just say no!
