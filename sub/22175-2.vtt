- Deanna's kicking ass
right now.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.503
I don't think I've ever seen
her move that fast.

33:58.569 --> 33:59.804
- Yeah, and they're doing,

33:59.871 --> 34:01.038
like, two completely
different styles.

34:01.105 --> 34:02.206
- Like Gia's tattoo--

34:02.273 --> 34:03.641
it's a crazy cool image, huh?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.410
It actually has, like,
the bird head in there,

34:05.476 --> 34:06.844
and everything
with the cool clock.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.181
- Yeah, I think, like, right
now I can't really tell.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.453
- She's trying not
to break my fingers.

34:22.126 --> 34:23.327
- I think I know
what it feels like

34:23.393 --> 34:25.830
to be a monkey in a cage.
- I know, right?

34:27.398 --> 34:28.766
- Is the crowd bothering you?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.501
- Hell yeah.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.103
It's pretty obnoxious,
actually.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.704
- Just try to zone
all that [bleep] out.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.440
- Yeah, I'm trying.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.208
- Two hours left.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.177
[cheers and applause]
Two hours!

34:43.681 --> 34:46.350
- Deanna has these sort of
trash polka,

34:46.417 --> 34:48.286
like, points coming down.

34:48.351 --> 34:51.054
- Yeah.
- But they're not solid black.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.556
- It's kind of tough
to pick out

34:52.623 --> 34:56.360
what's a design point
and what's a smear,

34:56.427 --> 34:58.796
and if she doesn't execute
that perfectly

34:58.863 --> 35:00.465
it's literally
just gonna look--

35:00.531 --> 35:02.433
- Sloppy.
- Yeah.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.101
- Equally as concerning,

35:04.168 --> 35:07.839
Gia is having a really hard
time with the live crowd.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.340
- It's definitely slowing
her down.

35:09.407 --> 35:12.176
{\an1}I just wish she wouldn't
make me so nervous.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.712
- The crowd is definitely
messing with my head.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.582
It's distraction after
distraction after distraction.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.318
- So the noise
doesn't bother you?

35:20.384 --> 35:23.321
- It's the crowd
that's annoying.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.957
When they walk by,
it shakes the floor.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.625

Deanna's tattoo, it fits

- There is just so much detail.
It's so realistic.

36:03.928 --> 36:05.463
It's textured.
You can see the feathers.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.664
If you look at it,

36:06.731 --> 36:07.965
it almost looks like

by far.

36:51.742 --> 36:53.711
Her detail is amazing.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.112
<i>The phoenix is beautiful.</i>

36:55.179 --> 36:57.281
Gia's got this all the way,
all the way.

36:57.348 --> 37:01.252
- To do a half sleeve
in six hours, it was risky.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.355
- Deanna's got the best tattoo.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.557
Part of it almost looks like
she's got brush strokes on it

37:06.624 --> 37:08.159
with great color saturation.

37:08.225 --> 37:10.261
- He came up
with the wing concept,

37:10.328 --> 37:12.163
and then I put
my artistic spin on it.

37:12.229 --> 37:13.731
- Nice work.
Keep it up.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.933
- Thank you very much.
- Very proud, sir.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.501
- I don't know, man.

It's a super tough decision.

Gia--the busy-ness.

<i>There's a lot going on in</i>

37:23.541 --> 37:24.742
<i>but when you get close to it.</i>

37:24.809 --> 37:25.876
- Dude, those colors
are badass though.

37:25.943 --> 37:27.211
Did you see them?

37:27.278 --> 37:28.713
- No, they are badass.
I'm not dismissing that,

37:28.779 --> 37:31.215
but from a far, it's hard to
tell what the hell it is.

37:31.282 --> 37:34.352
But Deanna's tattoo from a far,
I can tell it's a wing.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.686
<i>- I loved her tattoo.</i>

37:35.753 --> 37:37.321
<i>Did you see the detail</i>
<i>on the feathers?</i>

37:37.388 --> 37:39.056
- Do you think that Deanna
made a bad choice

37:39.123 --> 37:40.825
by not doing a lot more color
than what she did?

37:40.891 --> 37:42.326
<i>- I guess I really appreciate</i>
<i>her a lot</i>

37:42.393 --> 37:44.195
<i>for putting more balls</i>
<i>inside of this.</i>

37:44.261 --> 37:46.530
I'm being torn apart right now.
- It's a tough decision.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.099
It really is.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.503
{\an3}- So I feel like it's really
neck and neck.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.706
- When it comes
to design and style...

37:55.773 --> 37:58.576
{\an1}I'm personally leaning
towards Deanna.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.077
- I feel the opposite.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.545
- I think the difference
is that

38:01.612 --> 38:03.214
Gia's tattoo has focal points.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.216
<i>You look right at the jewel,</i>
<i>right at the bird.</i>

38:05.282 --> 38:08.185
<i>Deanna's tattoo, you're not</i>
<i>sure what you're looking at.</i>

38:08.252 --> 38:10.655
- Gia's is an illustration
that tells a story.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.090
That's not the type of tattoo

38:13.157 --> 38:14.825
that Deanna was going for.

38:14.892 --> 38:19.163
<i>She decided to make the entire</i>
<i>thing more design-oriented.</i>

38:19.230 --> 38:21.165
- It was kind of,
sort of this attempt

38:21.232 --> 38:23.601
<i>at a few different styles</i>
<i>that clashed together.</i>

38:23.668 --> 38:25.870
- I would rather wear Deanna's.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.171
- Okay, let's talk
about outline.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.239
Those lines were solid
Gia put in.

38:28.305 --> 38:29.340
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

38:29.407 --> 38:30.508
<i>- They were beautiful.</i>

38:30.574 --> 38:32.810
<i>It was one pass,</i>
<i>confident lines.</i>

38:32.877 --> 38:34.211
<i>Whereas for Deanna's tattoo,</i>

38:34.278 --> 38:35.946
<i>there were a lot</i>
<i>of really beautiful lines,</i>

38:36.013 --> 38:37.214
but I wish there were
more of them.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.683
- In Gia's tattoo,

38:38.749 --> 38:40.918
<i>all of her colors go</i>
<i>from all the way dark</i>

38:40.985 --> 38:42.486
<i>to all the way white.</i>

38:42.553 --> 38:46.157
So I can't focus on anything
throughout the whole tattoo.

38:46.223 --> 38:49.460
- You can't deny that the
saturation and the application

38:49.527 --> 38:52.363
{\an8}<i>itself of Gia's tattoo</i>
<i>was significantly better.</i>

38:52.430 --> 38:55.633
{\an8}<i>Deanna's tattoo, it was</i>
<i>like halfway colored in,</i>

38:55.700 --> 38:58.502
{\an8}and there was no solid black.

38:58.569 --> 39:02.206
{\an8}- I will agree that Gia's got
her beat on application.

39:02.273 --> 39:03.574
- If it's this hard for us,

39:03.641 --> 39:05.309
I can only imagine
how hard it is going to be

39:05.376 --> 39:06.677
for the artists

39:06.744 --> 39:08.813
