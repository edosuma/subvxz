WEBVTT

00:36.369 --> 00:41.909
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.710 --> 00:45.549
I told that lady, Ms. Park Bok Ja to come at 3pm.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.219
Please give me a chance.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.259
I'll do my utmost to take great care of him.

00:51.060 --> 00:54.329
Doctors will use medicine to cure him physically,

00:54.759 --> 00:56.929
so I'd like to help him heal his heart...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.960
by doing my very best.

01:00.070 --> 01:03.399
Jae Seok is ignorant and he talks nonsense often,

01:03.469 --> 01:06.640
but he's such a great husband. Don't you think so?

01:07.670 --> 01:08.810
So far, yes.

01:09.969 --> 01:12.010
I'll make sure that we never get caught.

01:12.079 --> 01:15.709
A Jin is more simple-minded than you think. I bet she has no idea.

01:16.150 --> 01:18.680
I'll make sure that she never finds out,

01:18.780 --> 01:20.349
so just trust me.

01:20.519 --> 01:23.359
Ju Mi is in an awkward position now because her husband...

01:23.420 --> 01:25.120
has fallen out of favor with his father,

01:25.290 --> 01:26.730
but she still is the lady of the house.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.459
I'll pay you all the overdue interest as well...

01:29.629 --> 01:31.129
Is there anything you want?

01:31.829 --> 01:33.230
What do you want to buy the most?

01:34.769 --> 01:38.540
Do you think that I'll let a piece of trash like you have your way?

01:38.670 --> 01:40.540
Know your place, Park Bok Ja.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.040
You're just a maid here.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.680
My father-in-law's caregiver. Do you understand?

01:45.739 --> 01:46.849
Don't...

01:47.650 --> 01:49.310
provoke me, please.

01:50.549 --> 01:51.780
If you don't behave yourself,

01:54.590 --> 01:56.049
you'll get kicked out.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.449
(Ju Mi)

02:23.719 --> 02:25.550
- Hello? - A Jin.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.419
Can you come over for a few minutes?

02:50.009 --> 02:51.210
What should we do now?

02:52.509 --> 02:55.210
Let's calm down and find the best way to deal with it.

02:55.310 --> 02:57.180
She's one sneaky, scary woman.

02:57.750 --> 03:00.250
See? Do you still think that I'm being too harsh on her?

03:01.449 --> 03:02.650
Let me handle it.

03:04.789 --> 03:06.219
You should go to work.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.330
I'll come back after sending Ji Hu to school.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.469
(Queen Bee)

04:03.150 --> 04:04.680
Where did he go this early?

04:04.750 --> 04:06.280
He struggles to wake up every morning.

04:06.990 --> 04:07.990
That's strange.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.000
Have breakfast before you leave.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.000
No, I'll eat at home. Otherwise, A Jin will get angry.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.540
All right then.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.009
Let's have dinner together. We'll eat out.

04:34.379 --> 04:36.050
- Okay. - I'll come back tomorrow morning.

04:36.649 --> 04:37.649
All right.

04:38.850 --> 04:40.250
Tell that woman.

04:40.689 --> 04:42.250
- Which woman? - Ji Hu's mom.

04:43.290 --> 04:45.920
- What about? - You play soccer every morning.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.300
- Where is Dad? - I'm not sure.

04:53.569 --> 04:55.000
I haven't seen him at all this morning.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.199
Right, Aunt Jin Hui will give you a ride to your English lesson today.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.209
Call her right after class, okay?

05:00.470 --> 05:02.470
- Okay. - Ji Hu, are you going to school?

05:03.980 --> 05:05.339
Dear, where have you been?

05:06.680 --> 05:07.709
I went to exercise.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.180
What?

05:09.310 --> 05:11.050
- Morning exercise. - What kind of exercise?

05:11.279 --> 05:13.750
- Bike riding. - What? Bike riding?

05:14.050 --> 05:16.420
How random. You went out for a bike ride that early?

05:16.519 --> 05:19.089
Lately, I've been feeling like I'm getting old.

05:19.189 --> 05:21.129
It's the best exercise for increasing physical strength.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.290
- Do you want to do it with me? - No.

05:23.399 --> 05:26.329
I do yoga and Pilates, and I even go to the gym. I get enough exercise.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
Right.

05:28.029 --> 05:29.029
Well...

05:32.800 --> 05:33.939
Am I not getting breakfast?

05:34.769 --> 05:36.639
Go wash up. I'll prepare it for you.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.079
Nice.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.790
What?

05:47.189 --> 05:49.850
Ju Mi was right. What should we do?

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
Has that old man gone senile?

05:53.319 --> 05:56.829
I mean, if Dad slept with a woman in his arms...

05:56.930 --> 05:58.829
You know. Well, I mean...

05:58.930 --> 05:59.959
Can he go all the way?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.300
Can he achieve the goal?

06:02.399 --> 06:04.240
You had no friends in school, right?

06:04.300 --> 06:06.269
Weren't you an outcast that couldn't understand anyone?

06:07.139 --> 06:10.639
Just think of it as her working overtime at night...

06:10.709 --> 06:13.550
- and give her a raise. Then... - Don't be ridiculous.

06:13.649 --> 06:16.649
Do you think she'd just want overtime pay?

06:16.720 --> 06:17.750
Then, what?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.149
Are you saying that she'd want to marry Dad?

06:20.290 --> 06:21.689
That's just absurd.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.189
That absurd thing is happening right now.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.420
That's why I'm talking to you about it.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.970
Is that how you've always worked in the past?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.939
How many men have you seduced that way?

06:43.040 --> 06:44.139
What are you talking about?

06:44.209 --> 06:46.850
You're here as a caregiver, so just do your job.

06:47.779 --> 06:50.079
How dare you slip into his bed at night?

06:50.519 --> 06:54.149
Did you think that he'd give you a key to his safe if you did that?

06:55.550 --> 06:59.490
You're way out of line.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.930
Mr. Chairman said that he gets scared at night.

07:03.399 --> 07:06.430
It's my duty to look after his health..

07:06.529 --> 07:08.129
as well as his mental well-being.

07:08.730 --> 07:13.100
That's why I stayed by his side until he fell asleep.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.939
That's such a bad excuse.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.639
It looked like you left the door open for someone to see it.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.480
What does that mean?

07:20.610 --> 07:21.810
I left it slightly open on purpose...

07:21.910 --> 07:23.920
so that no one gets the wrong idea like this.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.649
I didn't want the closed door to make anyone's imagination run wild.

07:26.889 --> 07:29.490
Hence, I left it open a bit to show that there's nothing to imagine.

07:30.889 --> 07:32.819
Do you think that things will change...

07:33.189 --> 07:34.930
just because you and Father slept in the same bed?

07:35.129 --> 07:36.389
Not a chance.

07:36.860 --> 07:40.730
You're just a maid here.

07:40.829 --> 07:43.199
I'm a caregiver, not a maid.

07:44.069 --> 07:47.069
Aren't you a professor? Get with the times. No one...

07:47.310 --> 07:48.709
even uses that word anymore.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.740
What a joke.

07:53.279 --> 07:54.449
Apologize.

07:54.509 --> 07:55.649
You asked me...

07:55.750 --> 07:58.750
how many men I've seduced that way. I've never done anything...

07:59.350 --> 08:01.689
- to deserve hearing that. - Know your place.

08:01.790 --> 08:05.019
Ms. Park, can you win a man over...

08:05.290 --> 08:07.089
by just sleeping with him once?

08:07.689 --> 08:08.829
Then,

08:09.259 --> 08:13.329
why are you still alone and lonely like this?

08:14.600 --> 08:18.069
How dare you run your mouth like that?

08:18.439 --> 08:21.040
Just do your job if you don't want to be kicked out.

08:21.939 --> 08:24.209
What did you just do?

08:25.410 --> 08:28.279
In this age, you can be arrested for assault if I press charges...

08:28.350 --> 08:30.519
against you regarding this. You know that, right?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.049
Do you read newspapers?

08:35.190 --> 08:36.450
What... What did you say?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.789
You might end up behind bars...

08:42.159 --> 08:43.899
before I get..

08:44.899 --> 08:46.659
kicked out of this house.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.210
You better watch out from now on.

09:06.919 --> 09:07.990
(Good morning.)

09:13.190 --> 09:14.360
Good morning.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.460
I hope that a warm cup of coffee...

09:16.559 --> 09:18.860
energizes you and keeps you warm for the rest of the day.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.529
What? Partner?

09:22.299 --> 09:24.299
He's definitely an oddball.

09:31.809 --> 09:33.110
I hope...

09:33.710 --> 09:36.179
you have a good day too.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.220
(I hope you have a good day too.)

09:51.600 --> 09:53.259
Gosh, that wench.

09:56.899 --> 09:59.299
Ms. Woo would like you to come downstairs.

10:02.139 --> 10:03.139
Have some tea.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.450
You must know why I wanted to see you.

10:12.549 --> 10:14.720
- Yes, I do. - Please explain what happened.

10:14.789 --> 10:17.259
- It's a misunderstanding. - Whether it's a misunderstanding,

10:17.659 --> 10:21.490
I'll decide how to perceive it after I hear your explanation.

10:23.929 --> 10:27.129
Mr. Chairman said that he was having a hard time falling asleep.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.840
He asked me to stay by his side until he falls asleep,

10:33.710 --> 10:35.509
so I lied down on the bed.

10:36.909 --> 10:40.850
Then, I ended up falling asleep too.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.250
That's really what happened.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.350
Even if that's true,

10:47.289 --> 10:49.389
what you did is simply wrong.

10:50.259 --> 10:51.259
Ms. Park.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.960
You're here as his caregiver.

10:55.590 --> 10:56.830
Of course, I'm aware.

10:56.929 --> 10:59.429
And there's a line that you must not cross.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.700
Last night, you crossed that line.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.440
- Ms. Woo... - Please don't try to persuade me...

11:05.500 --> 11:07.840
by saying that you had no choice because you wanted...

11:07.940 --> 11:09.809
to do your best as his caregiver.

11:10.009 --> 11:13.779
It's only understandable when it's within reason.

11:14.409 --> 11:15.710
I'm sorry.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.049
I wasn't being thoughtful.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.549
You definitely weren't being thoughtful.

11:21.019 --> 11:23.120
It's more than enough reason to fire you.

11:24.990 --> 11:27.860
Please give me a chance, Ms. Woo.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.600
It was a mistake.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.639
Please don't make another mistake like this ever again.

11:40.309 --> 11:41.509
Do not cross the line.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.909
I won't, ma'am.

11:46.610 --> 11:47.850
I'll let it slide for now.

11:49.679 --> 11:51.049
For now?

11:51.179 --> 11:54.419
I'll take some time to think about whether you should be let go or not.

11:54.789 --> 11:56.120
I'll be watching you.

11:58.990 --> 12:00.230
Thank you.

12:00.289 --> 12:02.129
- Please get back to work now. - Yes, ma'am.

12:02.429 --> 12:04.759
Please tell Ms. Jo to come downstairs.

12:06.129 --> 12:08.129
- Sure. - I'd like you to come as well.

12:11.940 --> 12:12.970
Sure.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.019
There was a room like this in the house?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.950
Ms. Woo is very selective about whom she lets into this room.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.159
We'll go with the simple and modern style this season.

12:33.629 --> 12:37.759
Please change all the plates to the ones I got from Artist Hong's show.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.299
Sure, I'll prepare everything.

12:47.639 --> 12:50.009
Please change Father's mattress topper to this one,

12:50.080 --> 12:51.879
and change his sheets to these.

12:52.740 --> 12:53.779
Sure.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.090
I should leave now. I have a get-together to attend.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.389
Right. You'll be going to Pungsuk's Kitchen today, right?

13:06.460 --> 13:07.490
Yes, ma'am.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.429
- Put this rice punch in the fridge. - Okay!

13:12.659 --> 13:15.429
This is Pungsuk's Kitchen, where various side dishes are made...

13:15.500 --> 13:17.799
with certified organic ingredients only.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.379
Pung Suk started out as a helper for S Group chairman's personal chef.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.879
After the chairman died, she got a hefty severance pay...

13:26.080 --> 13:29.009
and bought this apartment awaiting redevelopment with that money.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.279
Then, she started making her famous radish kimchi,

13:33.519 --> 13:35.690
which is now known as Pungsuk Kimchi,

13:35.889 --> 13:39.259
and has charmed the picky taste buds of the ladies in Gangnam.

13:39.789 --> 13:41.759
She only accepts cash..

13:41.860 --> 13:43.799
and never pays any taxes.

13:44.259 --> 13:47.269
Satisfying the wealthy's refined taste in food...

13:47.429 --> 13:50.169
has earned her their protection.

13:51.269 --> 13:54.970
Clever ones in the middle class who spend a lot of time with the rich...

13:55.309 --> 13:59.139
earn money through using their sense of privilege and pretentiousness.

14:04.850 --> 14:08.220
Pungsuk's Kitchen was known for its delicious food,

14:08.549 --> 14:11.889
but the food wasn't really juicy and irresistible.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.730
"You've never seduced a man in your life."

14:16.799 --> 14:20.169
"How dare you accuse me of seducing him?"

14:20.600 --> 14:22.269
- That's what she said. - My gosh.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.299
Did she really sleep with the chairman?

14:24.399 --> 14:25.399
She totally did.

14:25.470 --> 14:27.870
He has diabetes and he has even had strokes.

14:27.970 --> 14:29.210
There wouldn't be much he could do.

14:31.110 --> 14:33.879
But Ms. Woo didn't kick her out.

14:34.649 --> 14:36.049
That's what's strange.

14:36.649 --> 14:37.850
Why didn't she kick her out?

14:38.320 --> 14:39.350
That is strange indeed.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.389
- Come in. - A Jin.

14:49.460 --> 14:50.659
- Hey, you're here. - Yes.

14:51.399 --> 14:52.830
- Have you had breakfast yet? - Yes.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.169
- What is today's schedule like? - You have the brunch.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.740
Then, you have the wine class at 2pm.

14:58.669 --> 15:01.470
At 5pm, you're supposed to visit Ms. Seo at Hawon Gallery.

15:01.570 --> 15:04.980
Ji Hu has her violin lesson at 5pm. and the essay writing lesson at 9pm.

15:05.409 --> 15:08.279
The special lecture is next week. That's it.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.580
Ms. Park Bok Ja sent her resume via e-mail when she responded...

15:12.750 --> 15:14.789
- to the job posting, right? - Yes, she did.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.690
Can you send it to me again?

15:16.860 --> 15:17.860
- Sure. - Thanks.

15:17.990 --> 15:18.990
But why?

15:19.159 --> 15:21.330
Something's been bothering me. I just want to check something.

15:23.860 --> 15:26.360
There is a speed bump coming up.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.230
Did you see it? Did you see the speed bump?

15:34.539 --> 15:35.769
You're a genius.

15:37.809 --> 15:40.710
Hello? That's the place, Ms. Baek.

15:40.809 --> 15:41.980
They offer valet parking.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.580
I'm almost there too. All right.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.750
You'll be arriving at your destination shortly.

15:47.950 --> 15:50.820
Yes, ma'am.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.600
Please just treat me as In Jae's mom.

16:02.070 --> 16:04.700
Don't feel uncomfortable around me because your kids have quit.

16:06.039 --> 16:07.070
All right.

16:11.409 --> 16:14.409
The eggs in the Eggs Benedict is exceptionally soft today.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.250
It's delicious indeed.

16:17.950 --> 16:19.980
Since In Jae and Ji Hu are the only ones left,

16:20.250 --> 16:22.820
the class must feel like a private tutoring session, right?

16:23.789 --> 16:27.690
I heard Ji Hu will represent the school at the drawing competition...

16:27.830 --> 16:29.690
organized by Korea Illustrated.

16:29.830 --> 16:31.230
Ji Hu is even good at art.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.029
It must be hard to help her choose a career path.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.429
Kids who are only good at one thing makes it easy for their parents.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.570
Ji Hu is good at everything.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.909
That's not true, Gi Ok. You have no idea how clumsy she is.

16:42.070 --> 16:45.480
You're already famous. I guess you'll become even more famous soon.

16:45.909 --> 16:47.750
Her personal information is already all over my blog.

16:47.809 --> 16:49.009
There are so many comments.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.620
"She used to be a flight attendant. She won the Miss Smile pageant."

16:52.679 --> 16:54.419
"Her husband's family owns Daesung Pulp."

16:54.419 --> 16:57.460
"I go to the same gym as her husband."

16:57.590 --> 16:59.460
I also get a ton of messages with questions about her.

16:59.559 --> 17:02.830
So many men including married ones ask me to introduce her to them.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.059
Married guys too? That's considered cheating.

17:05.829 --> 17:06.930
How shameless.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.769
They shouldn't have legalized adultery, don't you think?

17:10.039 --> 17:13.339
People no longer feel guilty about cheating on their spouses.

17:13.470 --> 17:15.740
Being attractive is so important for women.

17:15.970 --> 17:18.740
Pretty old ladies get special treatment at retirement homes.

17:20.608 --> 17:24.618
By the way, is it true that you never had any plastic surgery?

17:25.150 --> 17:26.690
That's right, nothing.

17:27.519 --> 17:29.289
But you look so different in your yearbook photo.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.190
Well, I guess we'll have to believe you.

17:31.519 --> 17:34.160
What do you mean? Why would I not tell you if I got plastic surgery?

17:34.259 --> 17:36.130
It's nothing to be embarrassed of.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Is that how you feel about your eyes and nose?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.170
If every woman looked like A Jin,

17:45.240 --> 17:48.109
all the plastic surgery clinics in Sinsa and Apgujeong would shut down.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.210
Gosh, I get so annoyed when I see her.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.309
Sorry, Gi Ok.

18:09.359 --> 18:11.059
There's no such thing as a secret.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.000
I know about it, but Gi Ok doesn't. I mean, not yet.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.240
Wait.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.200
What do you mean by that?

18:19.839 --> 18:21.640
You must know what I'm talking about.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.079
What are you trying to say?

18:26.240 --> 18:29.809
I hope it ends before Gi Ok finds out.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.250
I don't know what it is that you know,

18:33.019 --> 18:34.220
but it must be a misunderstanding.

18:35.089 --> 18:36.349
Then, I'd be relieved.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.400
Gyeong Hui, the water.

19:02.180 --> 19:03.650
Where did my hearing aids go?

19:04.079 --> 19:05.180
I can't hear anything.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.019
What are you thinking about?

19:39.579 --> 19:40.920
It's nothing.

19:41.190 --> 19:43.819
Sir, shall I read a book aloud for you?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.259
It's okay.

19:45.319 --> 19:47.759
Let's just watch a movie today.

20:09.150 --> 20:12.349
Soy sauce marinated crab isn't good for those with diabetes,

20:12.450 --> 20:14.220
so please don't eat too much of it.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.759
They say that food and medicine come from the same source.

20:16.920 --> 20:17.960
What does that mean?

20:18.059 --> 20:21.490
It means that good food can be like medicine in and of itself.

20:21.759 --> 20:25.430
When we crave for something, we must eat it even if it's not healthy...

20:25.730 --> 20:27.200
because the joy from it will help us heal.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.500
My gosh.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.500
Sir.

20:32.839 --> 20:35.240
I'll take you to your kinesiotherapy session...

20:35.369 --> 20:37.539
instead of Secretary Oh today.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.880
All right.

20:40.549 --> 20:41.680
Ms. Jo.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.789
I'm going to take Mr. Chairman to his kinesiotherapy session,

20:49.019 --> 20:53.259
so please kindly change the curtains in his room for me.

20:55.490 --> 20:58.130
- Sure. - And please don't worry...

20:58.359 --> 21:01.329
about cleaning my room when you're cleaning upstairs today.

21:02.170 --> 21:03.500
I'll do it myself.

Okay.

21:13.009 --> 21:14.380
Trust and doubt.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.079
When we encounter a crossroads in our pursuit of truth,

21:17.450 --> 21:21.220
we often choose doubt over trust.

21:33.769 --> 21:34.769
Hello?

21:34.769 --> 21:35.769
Hello.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.769
You know who I am, right?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.509
Your partner in the meditation class.

21:43.069 --> 21:46.009
Yes, of course. Hello, partner.

21:46.980 --> 21:50.250
Well, I'm actually calling to ask you a favor.

21:50.349 --> 21:51.680
Sure, go ahead.

21:52.849 --> 21:55.819
By any chance, can you do a background check...

21:56.450 --> 21:59.460
I mean if I give you a social security number,

21:59.559 --> 22:02.230
would you be able to investigate that person's past?

22:02.630 --> 22:04.730
I was wondering if it'd be possible.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.630
- I see. - It's too much to ask, right?

22:06.730 --> 22:07.769
Yes, it is.

22:09.430 --> 22:12.140
All right. Please don't worry about it then.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.470
It is illegal,

22:14.569 --> 22:17.140
but the court often cooperates when it leads to a civil suit.

22:17.279 --> 22:19.740
If you need it done, I can utilize...

22:19.839 --> 22:21.509
my connections for you.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.980
No, it's okay. Please just forget about it.

22:24.049 --> 22:25.980
I was just kidding, so don't be like that.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.190
Please don't worry.

22:27.390 --> 22:29.819
Why don't you give me the person's...

22:29.950 --> 22:31.190
social security number and name?

22:31.920 --> 22:33.019
All right then.

22:36.259 --> 22:38.960
- It's 720813... - Yes.

22:39.430 --> 22:43.940
It's because doubt is the best way to defend oneself.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.869
However, no one can guarantee its outcome.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.980
Did you want to see me, sir?

23:00.220 --> 23:03.319
I'm busy, so I'll get right to the point. Did you sleep with my wife?

23:05.359 --> 23:06.390
Pardon?

23:06.559 --> 23:08.230
No, I didn't.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.299
Then, what happened?

23:12.059 --> 23:13.769
Tell me the truth.

23:14.069 --> 23:17.569
If you don't, I'll smash your head with this golf club.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.839
Just be honest. I won't care even if you say that you slept with her.

Then, what is it?

23:34.849 --> 23:37.359
Listen, you need to curry favor with me.

23:37.420 --> 23:39.890
My wife will have nothing if I kick her out.

23:41.589 --> 23:44.359
She has a man.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.769
Right, I'm not surprised.

23:50.599 --> 23:53.099
- I found out about it, so... - So, what?

23:54.109 --> 23:56.039
I gave her a few cards to choose from.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.339
You punk.

23:57.779 --> 24:00.480
No figure of speech, please. Put it in simple words.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.910
What do you mean by cards?

24:03.579 --> 24:05.880
- I asked her for money. - You brat!

I'm so sorry.

24:08.390 --> 24:11.559
Gosh, this jerk.

24:12.490 --> 24:15.059
So? How much did you get?

24:16.589 --> 24:17.630
She gave me 30,000 dollars.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.069
And you also asked her for a permanent position, right?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.029
Yes, sir.

24:28.009 --> 24:31.180
You probably didn't know that I used to be a thug.

I wanted to celebrate Daesung Pulp's success,

25:03.269 --> 25:05.509
- so I titled it as Celebration. - That's such a nice title.

It's the eyes that saw what they shouldn't have seen...

32:34.130 --> 32:35.490
Of course, I totally trust you.

32:37.029 --> 32:40.130
By the way, all the accessories that you're wearing...

32:40.200 --> 32:42.329
look like works of art.

32:45.599 --> 32:46.710
Here.

32:49.069 --> 32:51.410
I made it. Do you like it?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.609
I love it.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.750
If Johannes Vermeer were alive now,

32:55.809 --> 32:57.819
he would create a new painting.

32:58.279 --> 33:00.750
"A Beautiful Lady Wearing a Pearl Necklace."

33:01.420 --> 33:02.450
You're such a sweet talker.

33:03.319 --> 33:05.359
You sure know how to win one's heart.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.660
How can I not adore you?

33:07.859 --> 33:10.259
Please continue to adore me, Ms. Seo.

33:17.569 --> 33:21.569
I told you not to push yourself too hard, sir.

33:22.069 --> 33:24.779
Ms. Park, that's enough. You must be exhausted.

33:25.710 --> 33:28.609
I'm totally fine.

33:36.859 --> 33:40.829
I'll call you back in a bit. Please give me a few minutes.

33:42.660 --> 33:44.200
I told you that I'll pay you back.

33:45.460 --> 33:46.529
Is it a creditor?

33:49.230 --> 33:50.269
I have to go.

33:50.700 --> 33:51.869
How much is your debt?

33:52.369 --> 33:53.369
Tell me.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.210
I'll pay it off for you.

33:55.609 --> 33:57.079
Why would you do that?

33:57.940 --> 33:59.380
I'll take care of it myself.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.950
It's impolite to reject such an offer.

34:01.109 --> 34:02.680
I told you that I want to pay it off for you.

34:02.980 --> 34:05.450
Call them immediately and pay it off right away.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.289
You really don't have to do that, sir.

34:09.449 --> 34:10.489
How much do you owe?

34:13.320 --> 34:14.590
How much is it?

34:39.420 --> 34:40.420
I'm exhausted.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.989
(Ju Mi)

34:51.699 --> 34:53.030
Ju Mi, I'm sorry I missed your calls.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.400
That woman is really strange.

34:55.730 --> 34:57.840
I bet she moved into our place with an ulterior motive.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.269
I'm looking into it.

34:59.539 --> 35:01.210
Please don't worry too much.

35:01.909 --> 35:02.940
Yes.

35:03.070 --> 35:04.610
I'll see you at home, Ju Mi.

35:05.380 --> 35:06.409
Okay.

35:14.619 --> 35:15.849
- Mr. Choi. - Yes, sir.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.559
- Prune that side. - Okay.

35:17.619 --> 35:19.960
- It needs to be pruned. - Over there, right?

35:20.059 --> 35:21.389
- Yes. - Okay, no problem.

35:21.630 --> 35:23.599
Yes, right there. What?

35:24.300 --> 35:26.000
That's enough. You can wrap up now.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.769
- I'll just finish this. - All right.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.219
- Gosh, Mr. Chairman. - That's enough. Come down now.

35:47.289 --> 35:49.690
Your face will get all tanned. You should go inside now.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.059
All right. Let's go back in.

35:54.389 --> 35:55.389
Sir.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.400
I will never...

35:59.500 --> 36:01.769
forget your kindness.

36:02.599 --> 36:04.500
You paid off my debt.

36:05.369 --> 36:07.039
I'll never forget about it.

36:08.369 --> 36:10.079
I'll devote myself...

36:10.710 --> 36:14.349
to working harder to take great care of you.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.619
Don't overreact. It wasn't even that much money.

36:19.050 --> 36:21.019
Stop being silly. Let's go inside.

36:23.619 --> 36:24.960
I don't know how to thank you enough.

36:26.829 --> 36:28.429
Come on. Let's go back in.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.460
How have you been?

37:04.760 --> 37:07.329
Well. By the way, I think we should meet...

37:07.429 --> 37:09.130
in Hannam-dong or Itaewon from now on.

37:09.300 --> 37:12.440
- Meeting here makes me anxious. - Why? Are we committing sins?

37:12.500 --> 37:15.340
Gosh, we're not doing something that everyone should see.

37:16.239 --> 37:18.840
When a man and a woman have dinner together,

37:18.980 --> 37:20.579
does it mean they're dating?

37:21.010 --> 37:22.550
This is a business meeting.

37:22.650 --> 37:25.219
Daesung Pulp's guest designer and I...

37:25.519 --> 37:27.289
are talking business right now.

37:27.690 --> 37:29.949
- Okay, Mr. Executive Director. - Let's take a break.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.219
- Are you ready to order? - Yes.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.860
Hey, what happened?

38:04.420 --> 38:07.090
By any chance, did your husband do this to you?

38:07.730 --> 38:08.789
Seong Su.

38:09.889 --> 38:11.400
I can't take it anymore.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.960
That jerk!

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
Gosh, that psycho.

38:15.199 --> 38:18.099
You're raising his child, and never even complain about anything.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.340
I envy your wife.

38:22.510 --> 38:24.510
You got a medical certificate, right?

38:25.010 --> 38:26.710
Divorce him and move out.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.179
I should at least wait until Yun Jae graduates elementary school.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.250
- He's not your son. - Don't say that, Seong Su.

38:32.679 --> 38:36.019
I've always thought of him as my own son.

38:36.420 --> 38:37.590
Because of Yun Jae,

38:38.960 --> 38:41.590
I'm still with Bong Sik.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.099
I adore him.

38:45.599 --> 38:47.469
He's very fond of me.

38:48.769 --> 38:50.269
You're too nice.

38:52.599 --> 38:55.440
Seong Su. By the way, you know Ji Hu's mom, right?

38:55.710 --> 38:56.739
Yes.

38:56.980 --> 39:00.980
I think that woman knows about our relationship.

39:04.679 --> 39:05.750
What?

39:12.119 --> 39:13.460
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.559
Mr. Kang, I'll get going now.

39:15.630 --> 39:17.500
- Okay. Good work today. - Thank you.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.500
Here you go.

39:23.369 --> 39:24.400
Thank you.

39:24.639 --> 39:27.369
It sounded urgent, so I got her financial information...

39:27.469 --> 39:29.010
and police record to start.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.409
I see.

39:31.309 --> 39:33.679
May I ask who she is?

39:36.449 --> 39:38.019
She is my father-in-law's caregiver.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.949
I had to find someone urgently,

39:41.190 --> 39:43.090
so I didn't have time to do a proper check.

39:43.889 --> 39:46.019
I also trusted her too easily.

39:47.730 --> 39:48.760
I see.

39:48.789 --> 39:50.460
She seemed like a good person.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.099
She was convicted of fraud and embezzlement seven years ago.

41:05.039 --> 41:06.300
Ms. Woo.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.139
Ms. Park, you'll have to leave.

41:14.809 --> 41:16.579
I'd like you to quit and move out.

41:17.849 --> 41:21.719
Ms. Woo, why are you being like this all of a sudden?

41:22.090 --> 41:23.760
You said that you'd let it slide.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.389
I found out that you've been convicted of fraud and embezzlement.

41:28.590 --> 41:29.960
Why didn't you tell me?

41:32.829 --> 41:35.869
How could I have told you? It's nothing to brag about.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.000
I want you gone first thing tomorrow morning...

41:38.099 --> 41:39.340
before Father finds out.

41:39.599 --> 41:42.539
- I was in a bit of a situation. - I don't want to hear about it.

41:42.639 --> 41:43.980
I don't think I need to hear it.

41:44.039 --> 41:45.980
You said that you'd give me another chance.

41:46.139 --> 41:48.579
Please give me a chance to prove myself to you.

41:48.679 --> 41:51.579
It's my fault because I hired you without vetting you first.

41:55.150 --> 41:57.420
I'll pay you for the full month.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.789
Please leave.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.460
Okay.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.730
All right then. I'll leave.

42:07.130 --> 42:10.900
But please allow me to stay just until Mr. Chairman's birthday...

42:12.139 --> 42:15.239
so that I can make a birthday meal for him.

42:15.309 --> 42:17.909
No, please move out tomorrow.

42:21.010 --> 42:23.849
Mr. Chairman paid off my debt for me.

42:27.420 --> 42:30.789
I was going to think of it as an upfront payment and work hard.

42:32.159 --> 42:36.460
If I leave just after he paid off my debt,

42:37.329 --> 42:39.929
he'll feel utterly betrayed.

42:40.300 --> 42:42.000
I'll explain everything to him.

42:42.099 --> 42:46.170
Are you saying you'll tell him that I've been in jail?

42:46.940 --> 42:49.309
You're so cruel.

42:50.010 --> 42:53.949
Have you thought about how it'll make him feel?

42:54.309 --> 42:58.019
Since you have such an easy and comfortable life,

42:58.719 --> 43:02.250
you must think that everyone who's been behind bars is horrible.

43:04.519 --> 43:05.920
Some people in this world...

43:06.889 --> 43:08.730
are victimized and falsely accused.

43:09.789 --> 43:11.199
Their stories would break your heart.

43:12.199 --> 43:14.929
Some are just born with the kind of fate that requires them to endure...

43:15.800 --> 43:17.940
getting locked up even though they've done nothing wrong.

43:21.610 --> 43:22.969
I promise.

43:24.539 --> 43:26.679
Just until Mr. Chairman's birthday...

43:28.079 --> 43:32.179
Please allow me to stay just until his birthday.

43:37.889 --> 43:38.889
All right.

43:39.989 --> 43:41.889
You can stay until then,

43:42.860 --> 43:44.400
but you must keep your word.

43:46.030 --> 43:47.599
Thank you.

43:49.199 --> 43:53.300
I'll make a birthday meal for him...

43:53.639 --> 43:57.239
and tell him everything myself.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.449
I promise you that I'll explain everything to him.

44:03.309 --> 44:04.420
Okay.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.320
Let's leave it at that.

44:07.119 --> 44:10.090
You must leave after that.

44:11.820 --> 44:12.889
Yes, of course.

45:00.039 --> 45:01.039
Taxi.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.880
To Yangjae-dong, please.

45:06.210 --> 45:08.110
I need to get there as quickly as possible.

45:20.989 --> 45:22.030
Come here.

45:22.030 --> 45:23.630
- I don't want to. - Give it here.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.500
(Queen Bee)

45:27.500 --> 45:28.829
What do you want to see?

45:31.500 --> 45:33.300
What name will you use to save my number?

45:34.139 --> 45:35.170
Give it to me.

45:36.880 --> 45:39.179
(Mr. Yun)

45:40.210 --> 45:41.309
Mr. Yun?

45:42.250 --> 45:43.920
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.550
What's ridiculous about it?

45:45.780 --> 45:48.119
- It's not ridiculous at all. - Gosh, stop!

45:57.760 --> 45:59.360
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

46:10.940 --> 46:12.409
He has another mistress now.

46:12.909 --> 46:14.780
- Sorry? - The CEO of Pungsan Technology.

46:16.010 --> 46:17.320
What goes around comes around.

46:17.619 --> 46:20.489
The one that broke the wife's heart gets her heart broken by another.

46:20.619 --> 46:23.050
The new mistress thinks that she'll be happy forever, but he'll die.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.090
Then, she'll realize that everything he has is under his wife's name.

46:26.929 --> 46:28.630
That's probably what will happen in a soap opera.

46:29.989 --> 46:31.630
Life is such a funny thing, isn't it?

46:32.000 --> 46:33.530
That man is really something.

46:34.130 --> 46:35.429
Why does he philander so much?

46:36.630 --> 46:38.869
I saw your husband at Take Two in Cheongdam-dong yesterday.

46:38.969 --> 46:40.139
He was with a woman.

46:40.369 --> 46:42.409
A woman? Who could it be?

46:42.510 --> 46:45.539
She was very young and pretty. What if he's cheating on you?

46:46.539 --> 46:47.750
My husband?

46:47.880 --> 46:50.119
I wouldn't even worry about him if he was that capable.

46:50.719 --> 46:52.250
Any man can cheat.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.989
He gets distracted too easily. He can't do two things at once.

46:55.090 --> 46:56.789
He's such a klutz.

46:56.989 --> 47:00.289
My husband would never philander because he's a total germaphobe.

47:04.829 --> 47:06.260
"In here..."

47:08.500 --> 47:10.869
Ji Hu, do you have a boyfriend?

47:11.199 --> 47:12.199
No, I don't.

47:12.539 --> 47:14.539
All elementary school girls have boyfriends these days.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.710
You're not in the position to ask that question.

47:18.780 --> 47:21.550
Gosh, you're right. It's so hard to find a decent guy.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.050
Ji Hu, what type of man should I look for?

47:26.050 --> 47:27.889
Someone...

47:28.489 --> 47:30.219
who is not like my dad.

47:30.420 --> 47:32.820
- Why? - Because he has no algorithm.

47:33.090 --> 47:35.389
Do you know why I study math so hard?

47:36.130 --> 47:37.300
Because of algorithms.

47:37.460 --> 47:40.500
It's where order and efficiency begin.

47:40.570 --> 47:42.170
My dad lacks it completely.

47:42.230 --> 47:43.230
What does that even mean?

47:43.539 --> 47:46.809
He goes out for a bike ride super early and dozes off in the evening.

47:47.039 --> 47:48.840
Don't you think that something is wrong?

47:57.949 --> 47:59.050
- Nice. - Yes!

48:00.190 --> 48:02.489
Wow. Jae Seok, great putts today.

48:02.619 --> 48:04.889
I've been putting it in pretty well these days.

48:10.030 --> 48:11.030
Go ahead.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.570
- Good shot! - Yes!

48:17.969 --> 48:19.900
The tailwind is really helping me today.

48:20.869 --> 48:23.309
The guys will go out for drinks after this.

48:23.380 --> 48:24.380
What should we do?

48:24.610 --> 48:26.750
Hyo Ju, isn't it your turn to arrange something?

48:28.449 --> 48:32.150
I booked a yacht for the evening so that we can watch the sunset there.

48:32.619 --> 48:33.619
I'm in!

48:37.590 --> 48:38.619
My gosh, this is nice.

48:39.489 --> 48:40.489
Here you go.

48:40.860 --> 48:43.829
- Gosh, thanks so much. - It's not for your wife, right?

48:44.159 --> 48:45.159
Of course, not.

48:45.800 --> 48:48.300
Anyway, good luck. I hope all goes well.

48:48.369 --> 48:49.400
Thanks.

49:03.880 --> 49:06.420
Aren't you guys here to serve us?

49:07.150 --> 49:08.949
What are you waiting for? Introduce your friends.

49:09.050 --> 49:12.059
Ladies, we'll serve and entertain you today.

49:13.159 --> 49:14.460
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

49:20.469 --> 49:23.030
Nice. That was great. Here you go, guys.

49:23.130 --> 49:24.869
- Cheers! - Cheers!

49:36.280 --> 49:37.280
All right.

49:44.119 --> 49:45.159
Hey.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.989
You should sit there. Ma'am, please sit here.

49:50.429 --> 49:51.429
You should...

49:51.699 --> 49:52.960
sit there.

49:53.030 --> 49:55.130
- Cheers! - Cheers!

49:58.070 --> 49:59.300
- Nice. - I can keep drinking today.

49:59.869 --> 50:01.409
Guys, they're here.

50:02.170 --> 50:03.480
- Oh, my. - Looking good.

50:03.539 --> 50:05.679
All right. One, two, three...

50:05.739 --> 50:06.780
The four of you stay.

50:06.780 --> 50:08.110
- Yes! - All of you are staying.

50:08.510 --> 50:10.380
- Go in. - All right, let's drink.

50:10.579 --> 50:11.619
What's your name?

50:12.550 --> 50:14.449
- Hey, gorgeous. - Pour me a glass.

50:14.550 --> 50:15.820
Fill up your glass, everyone.

50:15.949 --> 50:17.719
Let's drink until we drop!

50:18.489 --> 50:21.460
Cheers, everyone. Bottoms up!

50:23.800 --> 50:26.300
What about me? Hey, change your seats.

50:30.670 --> 50:32.340
- Okay. - Gosh!

50:47.949 --> 50:49.750
Ma'am, it's your turn.

50:54.090 --> 50:55.360
Guys, excuse me for a minute.

50:56.030 --> 50:58.599
Hey, can we talk outside for a minute?

51:03.869 --> 51:06.869
You're so gorgeous. You're totally my type.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.469
I know. Aren't I pretty?

51:09.539 --> 51:11.409
Yes, you are. I was smitten as soon as I saw you.

51:14.909 --> 51:15.949
Do you want to die?

51:16.380 --> 51:18.320
Gosh, what are you doing now?

51:18.420 --> 51:22.090
Everyone is having a good time, so don't make me ruin it.

51:22.420 --> 51:23.460
Do you understand?

51:27.260 --> 51:29.159
Feed all the birds before you come back in.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.460
Otherwise, you'll end up as bird food.

51:39.869 --> 51:40.909
Cheers!

51:45.079 --> 51:46.380
It tastes even better out here.

51:47.409 --> 51:49.650
- This is so nice. - Thank you for arranging this.

51:54.219 --> 51:56.250
So, are you saying that Chairman Choi's wife...

51:56.320 --> 51:58.289
does all this for his mistress' memorial ceremony?

51:58.360 --> 52:00.489
You have no idea. She even buys all the ingredients for us.

52:00.559 --> 52:01.929
She's one magnanimous lady.

52:02.829 --> 52:04.460
She's like a living Buddha.

52:04.559 --> 52:07.099
That's probably why all of her children turned out so well.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.900
Her eldest son is a judge. Her second son inherited the company,

52:11.039 --> 52:12.269
and the third one is a professor.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.869
Her daughter had a rare disease, but she's fully recovered now.

52:15.070 --> 52:17.039
Good fortune came her way because she's so nice.

52:17.110 --> 52:20.550
Right, being unforgiving and greedy at that age won't do her any good.

52:20.780 --> 52:23.079
She can't take all the money with her when she dies.

52:23.579 --> 52:25.579
So, what's happening with Park Bok Ja? Will she be let go?

52:25.650 --> 52:27.619
Of course. Ms. Woo told her that she's...

52:28.789 --> 52:31.420
- So? Do you feel better now? - Gosh. Can't you tell?

52:31.590 --> 52:33.530
I'm so relieved.

52:40.730 --> 52:41.769
Gosh.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.539
Mr. Chairman, you look just like the actor..

52:44.599 --> 52:47.739
in the movie, "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

52:47.940 --> 52:50.280
Stop it. I look nothing like him.

52:50.510 --> 52:52.179
Gosh, I mean it.

52:52.409 --> 52:54.449
You really look like him.

52:55.050 --> 52:57.119
Let's go out and have a lot of fun today.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.780
Sure thing.

52:58.980 --> 53:01.219
We'll have so much fun today.

53:03.090 --> 53:04.090
All right.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.030
Do you want it?

53:14.400 --> 53:17.070
No, sir.

53:17.170 --> 53:18.599
Mr. Kim, pull over.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Yes, sir.

53:30.820 --> 53:31.849
Yes?

53:32.719 --> 53:35.090
Ms. Park, you should try this on.

53:36.019 --> 53:38.559
My gosh. What are you talking about, sir?

53:38.789 --> 53:40.190
Just try it on.

53:40.429 --> 53:42.030
I want to see how it looks on you.

53:53.769 --> 53:55.210
Here is your coffee.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.000
Just a moment, Mr. Kim.

54:23.199 --> 54:28.010
Please take a picture of me, Mr. Chairman, and Cat.

54:28.670 --> 54:30.780
Come here, Cat.

54:31.440 --> 54:35.150
- Look at you. You're so cute. - All right.

54:35.349 --> 54:38.150
- Let's take a picture together. - 1, 2, 3!

54:45.860 --> 54:49.989
Sir, shall I dye your hair with henna?

54:51.000 --> 54:54.400
Just dying your hair will make you look 20 years younger.

54:55.099 --> 54:57.599
Henna is completely safe and non-toxic.

54:59.670 --> 55:01.809
- Sure. - All right. Let's go in.

55:02.110 --> 55:03.239
Let's go.

55:10.949 --> 55:13.820
Hey, why is your face so tanned? Did you play golf?

55:14.219 --> 55:15.590
I was on a yacht.

55:15.820 --> 55:19.460
Make sure you wear sunscreen. Otherwise, you'll get age spots.

55:20.230 --> 55:21.530
Mom, I want food.

55:21.690 --> 55:23.659
Gosh, all right.

55:31.070 --> 55:33.670
I've been craving this so much, Mom.

55:33.739 --> 55:34.769
It's so good.

55:34.869 --> 55:36.880
The kimchi is overly fermented. It's very sour, isn't it?

55:36.980 --> 55:39.539
That's when it's most delicious. Make me another wrap.

55:39.610 --> 55:40.650
Okay, hang on.

55:44.219 --> 55:45.250
It's delicious.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.789
So? Will that caregiver leave?

55:49.150 --> 55:50.190
Yes.

55:50.320 --> 55:52.489
Father is very fond of her though.

55:52.590 --> 55:53.960
I'm worried about how he'll react.

55:54.690 --> 55:58.099
How much of the company shares does Jae Seok have?

55:58.900 --> 56:00.369
Why are you asking such a question?

56:00.500 --> 56:03.230
Who will get all of your father-in-law's money...

56:03.329 --> 56:06.400
after he dies? You need to do the calculation in advance.

56:06.769 --> 56:08.940
That's not what I should be thinking about now.

56:09.039 --> 56:10.780
I must focus on helping him recover his health.

56:10.880 --> 56:13.349
Fine. You're a nice person and I'm so materialistic.

56:13.409 --> 56:14.409
Goodness.

56:14.409 --> 56:16.980
Gosh, hurry up. Make me another wrap with the sour kimchi.

56:17.079 --> 56:18.880
- Hurry! - Okay, I'm making it now.

56:18.949 --> 56:20.289
All right, here.

56:20.889 --> 56:23.150
I only found out much later that she was raised without a dad...

56:23.519 --> 56:28.730
and that she grew up where she had to learn to love...

56:29.090 --> 56:30.599
over-fermented kimchi and sujebi.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.559
Eat as much as you want.

57:02.329 --> 57:03.530
I heard that her dad...

57:03.829 --> 57:06.460
passed away when she was eight.

57:06.900 --> 57:10.869
After losing her dad, she never listened to the music...

57:11.269 --> 57:12.800
he used to listen to.

57:13.539 --> 57:17.179
She felt that hearing the music might make her break down,

57:18.880 --> 57:21.480
so she chose to protect herself from it.

57:32.219 --> 57:33.489
You're back.

57:33.630 --> 57:35.460
What's with the cat?

57:36.130 --> 57:38.960
What do you think? It's a cat.

57:40.170 --> 57:41.469
Isn't my cat so cute?

57:41.829 --> 57:44.469
Who told you that you can have a cat in our house?

57:44.840 --> 57:48.539
I didn't buy this cat. Mr. Chairman bought it for me.

58:16.699 --> 58:18.039
What is this cat doing here?

58:20.210 --> 58:21.239
Answer me!

58:23.010 --> 58:24.739
I asked you what this cat is doing here!

58:46.400 --> 58:48.769
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:48.900 --> 58:51.400
She said that she'll leave after making a birthday meal for Father.

58:51.469 --> 58:53.710
She'll really leave, right? I hope you're sure about it.

58:53.769 --> 58:54.809
Help me put on a show.

58:54.909 --> 58:56.880
You're not my dad's type.

58:56.940 --> 58:58.079
Fix a meal for me.

58:58.139 --> 59:00.909
- I'm a caregiver. - So, what?

59:01.050 --> 59:03.010
- Are you serious? - Just act like you know nothing.

59:03.110 --> 59:05.679
I can't believe she had the nerve to be so arrogant.

59:06.019 --> 59:07.090
Mr. Ahn.

59:07.719 --> 59:09.619
You must have been overworking yourself.

59:09.690 --> 59:11.860
- You should sleep at home. - Whose home?

59:11.960 --> 59:15.860
I saw documents with information on Mr. Chairman and the family members.

59:16.059 --> 59:19.699
- That can't be. - I should have vetted her.

59:19.960 --> 59:23.269
Give up already.

59:23.599 --> 59:25.900
I'll make sure she leaves right after your birthday tomorrow.

59:29.309 --> 59:32.579
I will never leave this house.

59:32.679 --> 59:34.949
Park Bok Ja! That's enough.

59:35.409 --> 59:36.579
Stop now!
