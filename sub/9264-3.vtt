AT THE GAME TONIGHT?

37:21.239 --> 37:24.200
I HIT JULIE LAST NIGHT.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.828
RIGHT ACROSS THE FACE.
I SLAPPED HER.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.589
SHH.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.593
I THINK I'M COMPLETELY
LOSING IT.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.429
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH OUR FAMILY.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.808

38:08.578 --> 38:09.788
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING TONIGHT, TIM.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.331
IT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.248
AND TO PUT AN END

38:12.290 --> 38:15.293
TO THIS SO‐CALLED FRIENDSHIP
THAT WE GOT.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.294
I QUIT THE TEAM TONIGHT.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.213

TO THINK FOR ONE SECOND

38:18.254 --> 38:19.464

I DON'T SUCK.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.721
I'M AN AWESOME COACH.

38:26.763 --> 38:27.722
IT'S JUST WITH MACGREGOR AROUND

38:27.764 --> 38:29.557
THERE'S NOT A WHOLE HELL
OF A LOT FOR ME TO DO.

38:29.599 --> 38:30.809
THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE I GOT

NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.400

I'M GONNA DO
