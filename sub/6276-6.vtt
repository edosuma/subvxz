00:12.417 --> 00:13.792
Previously on Ray Donovan:

00:13.875 --> 00:15.250
Hey, Frank.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.250
(groans)

00:16.333 --> 00:17.500
I'm about to become
the number-one

00:17.583 --> 00:19.875
law enforcement officer
in the United States.

00:19.959 --> 00:22.500
Hell, in the fucking
free world, Mick!

00:22.583 --> 00:24.583
But you Irish Spring,
you Lucky Charms eating

00:24.667 --> 00:26.625
pieces of fucking shit--

00:26.709 --> 00:28.417
you guys are gonna
bring me down.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.625
You got me wrong, pal.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.041
I'd never give up my son.
Go fuck yourself.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.500
Now give me something
I can use against him.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.250
There's rumor that
he's fucking someone's wife.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.709
Who?
His ASAC, Volcheck.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.417
You're a cop.
Well, you never know

00:41.500 --> 00:42.417
when you're gonna
get in trouble.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.834
If you do, give me a call.

00:43.917 --> 00:46.792
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

00:46.875 --> 00:48.667
You let go of me!
Call the police!

00:48.750 --> 00:49.542
ABBY:
I don't want to go home.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.792
Can we go to a hotel
and have sex?

00:52.875 --> 00:54.417
(wry laugh)

00:54.500 --> 00:55.583
What do you think?

00:55.667 --> 00:56.125
It's the deodorant I stole

00:56.208 --> 00:56.792
from your bathroom

00:56.875 --> 00:59.583
the night you fucked me.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.959
You like it?

01:02.041 --> 01:05.166
Cool.
Why don't you go
take it for a spin?

01:05.250 --> 01:06.917
He loves it.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
There's a...
little Mexican joint

01:08.083 --> 01:09.542
around the corner--
do you want to join us?

01:09.625 --> 01:10.959
Jesus, Marvin,
what are you doing here?

01:11.041 --> 01:11.959
My dad'll kill you.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.625
MARVIN:
I miss you, Bridg.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.792
MAN:
Found an ounce of marijuana
in Bridget's backpack.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.834
I didn't do it.
I don't have any pot.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.709
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:19.792 --> 01:20.417
RAY:
We killed a fuckin' priest.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.792
Could get dug up any day now

01:21.875 --> 01:22.959
and she knows who put him there.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.583
She's not gonna say anything.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.417
She's got a fuckin' family!

01:34.083 --> 01:35.250
(woman breathing passionately)

02:05.083 --> 02:07.208
Mm.

02:13.792 --> 02:17.041
You all right, Tom?

02:18.208 --> 02:20.291
Oh... he fell asleep
in the sauna.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.583
Poor baby.

02:37.792 --> 02:40.542
Fuck her harder, Eddie.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.875
(laughs)

02:42.959 --> 02:45.041
Come on.

02:58.041 --> 02:59.125
Hey, Mom.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.583
You know what tomorrow is?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.500
Tomorrow's
Saturday, honey.

03:30.125 --> 03:33.041
You want to explain this?

03:34.875 --> 03:36.625
Marvin gave it to me.

03:36.709 --> 03:38.667
And you have no right
going through my room.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.667
Oh, I have every right.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.291
Fine. Keep it.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.542
Why did he give
this to you, Bridg?

03:46.625 --> 03:48.458
Why? Because he loves me.

03:48.542 --> 03:49.917
He loves you?
(scoffs)

03:50.000 --> 03:51.959
How would you know?

03:52.041 --> 03:53.166
What does that mean?

03:53.250 --> 03:55.417
You're a victim.
You don't think we hear you

03:55.500 --> 03:57.500
crying yourself to sleep
every night?

03:57.583 --> 03:59.375
I never heard anything.
You don't know what
you're talking about.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.834
You're so fucking
full of shit.
Hey.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.709
That's not how you
talk to your mother.
Of course

04:03.792 --> 04:05.333
you don't want me to say
anything-- the only reason

04:05.417 --> 04:07.208
she's crying is because of you.
Hey!

04:07.291 --> 04:09.458
ABBY:
She's seeing that boy again.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.625
His name is Marvin.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.500
Do you know about this?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.166
(sighs)

04:16.250 --> 04:17.917
Bridg, why didn't
you say anything?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.834
You beat the shit out of him.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.333
You think she's gonna
confide in you now?

04:21.417 --> 04:22.500
I didn't lay a finger on him.

04:22.583 --> 04:23.834
I'm seeing him again.

04:23.917 --> 04:24.792
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.500
Sweetheart, that boy
has real problems.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.041
So what?
I have real problems.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.250
What are you
talking about?
You're both going to therapy.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.834
You're probably
gonna get a divorce.

04:33.917 --> 04:34.875
And we're moving
to Trousdale?

04:34.959 --> 04:36.917
What's Trousdale again?
You don't got to worry

04:37.000 --> 04:38.959
about all that stuff.
Don't touch me.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.500
Calm down, Bridg.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.125
The cops planted pot on me.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.083
And you know it was
really about you.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.667
What?
Oh, yeah,
you didn't tell her,

04:45.750 --> 04:46.625
did you?

04:46.709 --> 04:49.250
(sighs heavily)
I'm going to the beach.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.792
With who?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.208
Not Marvin.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.500
That's all you care about.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.250
You're not going anywhere.
Just let her go.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.333
Don't leave me here.
Go get your stuff.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.625
(door opens, closes)

05:03.709 --> 05:04.750
She got arrested?

05:04.834 --> 05:06.709
She didn't get arrested.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.792
It was a mistake.
I looked into it.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.500
You're a fucking liar.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.875
It was about you,
wasn't it?

05:12.959 --> 05:13.792
She wouldn't
make that up.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.125
Calm down, Abby.
You know,
she's right.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.875
I am a victim.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.333
We're all your victims.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.208
You're not a fucking victim.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.208
She's a teenage girl.
She got upset.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.375
She doesn't mean it.
All right?

05:29.458 --> 05:32.375
She does mean it.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.542
We are fucked up, Ray.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.291
I had enough of this bullshit.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.250
So have I.

06:12.083 --> 06:14.417
Oh, wait, no, no, no. um...

06:14.500 --> 06:15.917
It's from Ray.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.834
Oh, you're the lezzy
works for my son.

06:18.917 --> 06:19.709
I been waiting
for this.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.959
Got a whole
celebration planned.

06:24.041 --> 06:24.917
Want to come in?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
No, thank you.

06:30.291 --> 06:34.208
There's only $300 in here.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.000
How am I supposed to
live on $300 a week?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.458
Every two weeks.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.250
Oh, no, no.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.709
This can't be right.
Call Ray.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.583
He gave that to me himself.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.583
I saved Ray's ass.
Did you know that?

06:48.667 --> 06:52.166
Risked my life.
Probably saved your ass, too.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.291
And who's gonna pay
for my goddamned doorframe?

06:55.375 --> 06:56.959
Hey, babe.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.291
Hi, Cherry.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.500
Hey, babe.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.291
Hi, Shorty.

07:02.375 --> 07:05.000
Haven't seen you
in a while.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.834
Yeah, well, I don't
get erections no more.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.041
Oh, that's
too bad, Shorty.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.250
You hang in there.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.250
150 bucks a week.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.834
What kind of stipend is that?

07:20.917 --> 07:23.667
You know what kind of car
my son drives?

07:23.750 --> 07:25.667
Mercedes CLS.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.542
You can't do shit
with that kind of money.

07:27.625 --> 07:32.041
That's exactly Ray's point.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.333
Bowel movements?

07:34.417 --> 07:35.917
Regular.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.709
Any new tremors?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.250
Here and there.

07:41.375 --> 07:44.750
It's the same as last time.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.375
And the medication's
working?

07:46.458 --> 07:49.250
Like-Like I said,
more or less.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.041
Great to see you,
Mr. Donovan.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.500
Frances'll finish up.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.750
I thought you quit.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.417
I am a nurse, Terry.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.625
This is my job.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.667
I'll find a new place to work.
Don't.

08:09.750 --> 08:13.041
I want to tell you the
truth about that night.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.875
No. I don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.917
You can't afford

08:19.000 --> 08:20.208
the house in Trousdale.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.875
I've looked at it from
every possible angle.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.583
What are you talking about?
I gave you the down payment.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.917
You gave me cash.
Ezra pays me in cash.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.667
Terry Donovan's Fite Club makes
a million dollars this month?

08:29.750 --> 08:30.875
I don't think so.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.250
I... I've been there.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.667
It ain't gonna happen.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.083
I can barely make that gym

08:35.166 --> 08:36.792
look like it covers the house
in Calabasas,

08:36.875 --> 08:39.875
but a $5 million house
in Trousdale? Forget it.

08:39.959 --> 08:41.291
Four point six.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.667
I told you to have
Goldman/Drexler

08:43.750 --> 08:46.375
put you on the books
20 fucking years ago.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.500
I'm on the books, they own me.

08:48.583 --> 08:49.750
Honey, you're not on the books

08:49.834 --> 08:50.166
because they don't
want you on the books.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.417
Oh, fine, Ray.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.917
You're a free man in Paris.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.583
But you can't afford
the house in Trousdale.

08:57.667 --> 09:01.291
So stay in Calabasas
and leave me the fuck alone.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.667
I want that house, Harriet.

09:04.291 --> 09:07.417
So start giving me checks
with fuckin' names on 'em!

09:18.041 --> 09:20.834
Hey, there.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.792
Hey.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.417
Lena, right?

09:25.500 --> 09:26.083
Yeah.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.250
You done?

09:28.333 --> 09:31.333
Yeah, I just finished
my 60 laps.
Nice.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.125
How much more you got?
I'm finished.

09:34.792 --> 09:35.834
I was just gonna
go in for a sauna.

09:39.208 --> 09:39.792
Want to join?

09:41.166 --> 09:43.542
Sure.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.917
You know, I have to be
at work in an hour.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.333
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause I was gonna

10:16.417 --> 10:18.166
try to make you late.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.125
(quiet laugh)

10:27.083 --> 10:29.000
Mm...

10:30.834 --> 10:32.917
I just have to run
to the ladies' room.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.375
Mm... mm-mm... mm-mm.
Okay?

10:34.458 --> 10:35.709
Yeah.

10:35.792 --> 10:36.917
I'll be right back.

10:38.417 --> 10:39.208
You don't go anywhere.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.542
All right?
Okay.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.834
Give me a second.
I'll be right back.

10:52.834 --> 10:55.542
NARRATOR: The cross stands
on a mass grave...

10:55.625 --> 10:59.709
just one of thousands
scattered all over Ireland.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.542
Such memorials
bear stark testimony

11:02.625 --> 11:04.166
to one of the greatest tragedies
in Irish history--

11:04.250 --> 11:07.375
the Potato Famine.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.625
(man singing on video)

11:22.375 --> 11:24.125
Isn't Ireland on an island?

11:24.208 --> 11:25.709
What's your point?

11:25.792 --> 11:28.333
I don't see why they couldn't
have just gone fishing.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.333
(phone rings)

11:37.667 --> 11:39.250
Patty?

11:39.333 --> 11:40.709
Hey.

11:40.792 --> 11:43.083
Hey. Is this a...

11:43.166 --> 11:44.625
Is this a good time?

11:44.709 --> 11:46.583
Yeah, what's up?

11:46.667 --> 11:48.458
Well, I was just, um...

11:48.542 --> 11:50.792
seeing what you were
doing for dinner tonight.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.041
I got no plans.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.333
I mean...

11:55.417 --> 11:58.542
nothing set in stone.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.667
(over phone):
Great, well I was gonna roast

12:01.750 --> 12:04.041
a chicken, and,
I don't know, I...

12:04.125 --> 12:05.000
I like chicken.

12:05.083 --> 12:05.959
Okay, great.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.583
(over phone):
You know, I feel bad

12:08.667 --> 12:09.291
I didn't put the right stem

12:09.375 --> 12:11.625
on Cliff's bike.

12:11.709 --> 12:12.834
It's been killing me.
(chuckles)

12:12.917 --> 12:16.291
So I-I could swing by the shop
on the way over.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.125
Cliff's actually, uh, staying
over at a friend's tonight.

12:19.208 --> 12:22.083
Oh.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.250
Okay.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.291
I could still fix it, though.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.500
Great.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.709
Do you mind?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.500
Oh, I-I've got
a noon appointment.

12:33.583 --> 12:34.500
I got to get to the salon.

12:34.583 --> 12:35.667
I'll see you later.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.834
Bye.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.792
What the fuck?

12:41.750 --> 12:43.834
Sorry.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.166
(sighs)

13:09.250 --> 13:11.125
Let me get this straight.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.417
You fuck his wife.
He fucks your wife.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.291
It's a threesome.
It's a foursome.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.291
And then when you're done,
you order a pizza.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.208
Is that it?

13:21.625 --> 13:23.750
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.667
I'm an FBI agent.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.250
You let me out of here-- now.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.458
(wry laugh)

13:33.792 --> 13:36.792
Sit down, Tommy.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.041
You like watching
Cochran fuck your wife?

13:44.750 --> 13:47.583
I didn't think so.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.750
But he's your boss.

13:48.834 --> 13:51.291
And if you don't let him fuck
your wife,

13:51.375 --> 13:54.291
he sends you to some fucking
place like Des Moines, huh?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.875
Is that it?

13:56.959 --> 13:58.542
Maybe I'm wrong.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.917
Maybe, uh, I don't know... maybe
you're actually enjoying this.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.417
You think
I like fucking Donna Cochran?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.667
I don't know.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.709
Jesus,
it's like fucking my mother.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.625
But what am I supposed to do?

14:09.709 --> 14:11.208
When he calls, we go.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.917
What choice do I have?

14:13.792 --> 14:16.166
How do you put up with that?

14:16.250 --> 14:18.542
He promoted me to ASAC.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.500
And now he owns you.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.500
You know what, Tom?

14:23.583 --> 14:27.458
We can fix this.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.375
We're good. He's gonna
meet you at his place.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.458
Okay, so you and Cochran
settled everything.

14:34.542 --> 14:35.834
So why are you doing this?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.458
Why? He's a killer.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.208
He slaughtered Tiny.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.417
Besides,
I need insurance.
I know,

14:41.500 --> 14:43.458
but...
Look, Avi, if I tell you
to wire a house,

14:43.542 --> 14:45.542
just wire the fucking house,
all right?

14:45.625 --> 14:46.500
Okay, boss.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.542
You're right.

14:48.625 --> 14:49.333
Okay.

14:49.417 --> 14:52.959
(phone rings)

14:53.041 --> 14:54.458
Yeah.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.959
I need you to come to the Expo.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.583
Ashley...
This isn't a joke, Ray.

14:58.667 --> 14:59.917
This is not for me--
it's for a friend.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.417
He needs your help.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.250
He'll pay you whatever you want.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.250
(knocking on door)

15:22.542 --> 15:25.000
What is it, Pie?

15:26.583 --> 15:28.500
I thought you didn't want to
hear anything I've got to say.

15:28.583 --> 15:32.375
I don't.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.709
What the hell
are you doing in there?

15:55.792 --> 15:56.500
MICKEY:
I'm jerking off.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.083
Come on in.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.083
(Mickey panting)

16:03.583 --> 16:05.875
(chuckles)
You fucker.

16:05.959 --> 16:08.041
(laughs)

16:08.125 --> 16:08.500
Yeah.
Score.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.375
Hey.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.709
And...

16:12.792 --> 16:15.875
it's Free Joint
Friday.

16:15.959 --> 16:18.041
Ooh. How 'bout that?
(chuckles)

16:23.542 --> 16:25.250
Here.
Thanks.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.208
All this pot, huh?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.083
All this pot right out
in the open there?

16:34.166 --> 16:36.041
Forget the pot, Mickey.
You should've seen

16:36.125 --> 16:38.750
all the fucking dough
they got in that place.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.291
Really?

16:40.375 --> 16:41.166
You don't read
the papers?

16:41.250 --> 16:44.750
See, they got
a big cash problem.

16:44.834 --> 16:48.041
The banks won't take it 'cause
the Feds still say it's illegal.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.625
Fuckin' Feds, man.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.291
I know about that.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.250
And the safe
they keep it in,

16:53.333 --> 16:56.250
it's a fucking Mosler Model 12.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.083
(chuckles)
It's nothing.

16:58.166 --> 17:01.542
Haven't seen one of those
since the '70s.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.083
No good?
Yeah,

17:03.166 --> 17:03.709
I could crack that thing.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.917
Given the time.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.625
You're shittin' me.

17:08.709 --> 17:09.834
Why don't we go down there
tonight,

17:09.917 --> 17:12.834
drive a fucking truck
up the back,

17:12.917 --> 17:15.709
rip the goddamn bars
off the windows.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.709
Like the cowboy movies.
(laughs)

17:17.792 --> 17:19.750
Blast through
the fucking bars.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.583
Choom!
(chuckles)

17:21.667 --> 17:24.291
No, no, no.

17:24.375 --> 17:27.583
We go in
through the roof.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.041
(exhales)

17:29.125 --> 17:32.458
You're going in
through the roof?

17:32.542 --> 17:33.583
Yes.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.875
(laughs)

17:36.959 --> 17:39.083
(indistinct chatter)

18:00.208 --> 18:04.208
Ashley has told me so much
about you, Ray.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.000
Thank you for coming.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.375
Sure.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.375
Why am I here?

18:30.458 --> 18:32.375
You're angry.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.959
You're impatient.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.166
But you know it.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.166
And you use it,

18:39.250 --> 18:40.792
don't you?

18:40.875 --> 18:44.500
I love that
about you, man.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.417
That's how empires are built.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.792
Do you know
who I am?

18:50.875 --> 18:52.667
Do you know what I do?

18:52.750 --> 18:53.875
Yeah.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.375
You write books.

18:55.458 --> 18:56.750
I love that.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.417
Simple. Clear.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.875
I write books.

19:00.959 --> 19:04.375
Do you know what else I do?

19:09.083 --> 19:11.709
I love this woman.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.792
I'm leaving
my wife for her.

19:20.917 --> 19:21.542
You know what
that means, Ray?

19:21.625 --> 19:23.166
No.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.875
It means hundreds
of millions of dollars.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.500
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.583
Yeah.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.083
Which is why...

19:33.166 --> 19:37.125
this is the last thing
that I need.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.291
(muffled shouting)

19:41.166 --> 19:44.750
He interrupted
my peak state ritual.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.959
I lost control.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.333
Do you ever
lose control, Ray?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.125
I bet you do.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.792
Those people out there paid
a lot of money, Manuel.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.792
They deserve my best.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.500
(Manuel shouts)

20:13.583 --> 20:15.458
(lock clicks)

20:17.333 --> 20:19.250
I did this.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.417
I own it.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.875
But I need you to fix it.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.291
(knocking on door)

20:28.375 --> 20:30.291
MAN:
Steve, five minutes.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.458
It's showtime.
(chuckles)

20:35.083 --> 20:37.625
You let me know
if you need anything.

20:39.834 --> 20:44.041
Isn't he amazing?

20:47.917 --> 20:50.041
(indistinct chatter)

20:54.625 --> 20:56.333
Hey.

20:56.417 --> 20:57.834
We're not done yet.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.834
Excuse us, please.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.750
Mm. Right.

21:05.125 --> 21:09.041
I don't know you, and I don't
work for you, all right?

21:09.667 --> 21:12.667
Okay, you're right, Ray.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.583
I was very presumptuous.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.709
Let's start over.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.000
I'm in some trouble here.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.000
I need some help.

21:21.083 --> 21:21.709
Will you...

21:21.792 --> 21:24.250
help me?

21:25.208 --> 21:27.792
All right.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.667
It's gonna cost you, though.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.375
A lot.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.792
Bring it.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.458
I make promises to this guy, you
better be able to back 'em up.

21:36.458 --> 21:41.291
How old were you
when your mother died, Ray?

21:41.375 --> 21:42.125
What?

21:42.208 --> 21:43.709
You were young,

21:43.792 --> 21:45.917
weren't you?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.709
ANNOUNCER:

Turn off your cell phones.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.166
Turn off your iPads.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.083
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

22:30.166 --> 22:32.959
(laughter and applause)

22:33.041 --> 22:35.083
Now here is one
that is going to hurt.

22:35.166 --> 22:37.625
For the next five hours,

22:37.709 --> 22:39.834
how 'bout we turn off our past,

22:39.917 --> 22:42.625
our resentments,

22:42.709 --> 22:44.917
all the things that we...

22:45.000 --> 22:47.625
cling to...

22:47.709 --> 22:50.083
that are keeping us
from our truest,

22:50.166 --> 22:53.792
most authentic selves.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.750
For the rest of
the afternoon,

22:56.834 --> 22:59.291
we're gonna practice
something that I call

22:59.375 --> 23:00.125
radical honesty.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.834
(cheering and applause)
Yeah?

23:02.917 --> 23:06.750
Right?

23:06.834 --> 23:09.834
Can we do that tonight?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.917
This was
a one-time thing.

23:22.875 --> 23:25.291
No.

23:25.375 --> 23:26.500
It can't be.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.959
What do you want, Terry?

23:31.041 --> 23:33.083
I want to marry you.

23:33.166 --> 23:36.417
I want to be with you.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.166
And how is that supposed
to work?

23:41.291 --> 23:43.667
You leave
your husband.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.583
I get down on a knee.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.959
And I'm supposed
to forget what happened?

23:55.375 --> 23:57.542
You said
you were gonna tell me.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.625
(sighs)

24:03.709 --> 24:06.959
Your brother murdered
that priest, didn't he?

24:07.041 --> 24:09.709
And you let it happen.

24:10.875 --> 24:14.166
That priest raped him.

24:15.250 --> 24:18.417
He raped both my brothers.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.917
I'm sorry, Terry.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.375
(sighs)

24:32.458 --> 24:34.208
I don't know what to do.

24:34.291 --> 24:35.792
I love you

24:35.875 --> 24:37.208
and I want to
be with you,

24:37.291 --> 24:40.583
but I can't condone murder.

24:47.709 --> 24:50.667
And your brother
scares me to death.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.583
(muffled groaning)

25:06.000 --> 25:08.125
(panting)

25:09.667 --> 25:11.083
I just deliver
his sandwich.

25:11.166 --> 25:14.000
He beat me.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.583
I don't understand.

25:15.667 --> 25:15.917
Where are you from?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Sololà.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.792
In Guatemala.

25:19.875 --> 25:22.083
You got family there?
In Guatemala?

25:22.166 --> 25:25.208
My wife, my children.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.166
(sniffles)

25:29.250 --> 25:31.166
(toilet flushes)

25:36.500 --> 25:38.959
I got a date tonight.

25:39.834 --> 25:43.375
So, what do you want me
to do about it?

25:45.375 --> 25:47.500
I don't know.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.500
I'm just really nervous.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.250
I'm a sexual anorexic.

25:53.333 --> 25:57.000
What if she wants me to...

25:57.083 --> 26:00.625
you know... do it?

26:04.667 --> 26:05.792
Wait here.

26:11.583 --> 26:12.834
Here. I got some roaches.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.917
Hey, you're gonna croak
any day now, right?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.166
That's what they tell me.

26:20.250 --> 26:23.917
Why don't you take out a life
insurance policy in my name?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.625
I'll pay for it.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.417
Someone should benefit
when you kick the bucket.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.792
(laughs)

26:29.875 --> 26:31.208
You got to be kidding.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.959
Nobody's gonna sell me
a life insurance policy.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.750
I have preexisting conditions
coming out my ass.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.750
(laughs)

26:40.834 --> 26:43.000
You could have my pension
if we got married.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.250
You know that's legal now.

26:44.333 --> 26:47.625
The world went fucking nuts
when I was inside.

26:47.709 --> 26:49.709
You can buy pot
in the strip mall,

26:49.792 --> 26:53.125
they got a black guy
in the White House,

26:53.208 --> 26:54.917
and two men can
marry each other.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.333
Mick?

26:57.417 --> 26:59.625
Mm.
I got a question.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.125
Will you marry me?

27:04.208 --> 27:07.125
(both guffawing)

27:11.583 --> 27:13.166
(coughing)

27:13.250 --> 27:14.875
(phone ringing)

27:14.959 --> 27:16.625
Oh, I can't breathe.

27:16.709 --> 27:18.166
It's my phone.
Ah.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.458
Where is it?

27:19.542 --> 27:21.375
Oh, I got it. Here.
It's ringing.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.542
(in a high-pitched voice):
Hello? Who is this?

27:24.625 --> 27:26.041
DEBBIE:
Hi.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.125
Yes, this is Debbie Gerson
from Paramount Pictures.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.083
I'm trying
to reach Mickey Donovan?

27:30.166 --> 27:32.208
SHORTY (in high-pitched voice):
Debbie Gerson from Paramount?

27:32.291 --> 27:33.875
Well, this is Shirley Donovan
from Warner Brothers.

27:33.959 --> 27:34.375
What?
(laughing)

27:34.458 --> 27:36.041
(both laughing)

27:36.125 --> 27:37.250
Oh. Paramount?

27:37.333 --> 27:40.083
Paramount. Give me that.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.041
(laughing)
Hey.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.875
Shh.

27:43.959 --> 27:46.500
This is Mickey Donovan.
What can I do for you?

27:50.667 --> 27:51.333
Terrance told me
you got a date.

27:51.417 --> 27:54.375
Congratulations.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.083
Thanks.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.041
Told me you were
a little stressed about it, too.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.083
Mm.

28:00.166 --> 28:02.959
I don't know why
he said something like that.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.709
Well, sometimes you just
need a little something

28:06.792 --> 28:08.875
to help you get over the hump;
get your confidence back.

28:10.917 --> 28:11.375
What is it?

28:11.458 --> 28:12.750
Soon as something

28:12.834 --> 28:16.208
gonna happen between you
and your lady, take it.

28:16.291 --> 28:19.208
Well, then what?

28:19.291 --> 28:21.250
Pop goes the weasel.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.333
I'm an American citizen, señor.

28:24.417 --> 28:27.291
I have a lawyer.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.417
I'm going to sue Steve Knight.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.917
You're not gonna sue
Steve Knight, Manuel.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.208
What'd you make last year?

28:36.291 --> 28:38.875
$30,000.

28:38.959 --> 28:40.250
How much of that
did you send home?

28:40.333 --> 28:44.959
Almost all of it.

28:45.041 --> 28:46.709
You ever have
a dream, Manuel?

28:46.792 --> 28:49.417
If you could do
anything you want,

28:49.500 --> 28:52.750
money was no object,
what would you do?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.291
I'd go back to my country,

28:57.375 --> 29:00.291
probably buy a football team.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.208
(quiet laugh)

29:02.291 --> 29:04.000
You're not getting a football
team, Manuel-- get real.

29:05.792 --> 29:08.542
Then I want
half-million dollars.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.625
$300,000.
Seems to me

29:10.709 --> 29:13.500
señor has a lot to lose.

29:13.583 --> 29:15.375
Yeah, well...

29:15.458 --> 29:17.458
you're right about that.

29:17.542 --> 29:20.000
All right, Manuel.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.834
$350,000.

29:22.917 --> 29:24.834
(knocking on door)

29:24.917 --> 29:26.333
(door opens)

29:27.750 --> 29:30.208
You got two fighters out here
want to be trained.

29:30.291 --> 29:32.625
I don't feel like training, Pie.

29:32.709 --> 29:33.667
You do it.

29:33.750 --> 29:37.333
You been holed up
in here all day, man.

29:37.417 --> 29:38.250
You got to put
that woman behind you.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.583
I can't.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.583
Well, this ain't
no way to live.

29:41.667 --> 29:44.000
It's goddamn depressing.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.500
Now get your shit together.

29:48.583 --> 29:51.333
This is a boxing gym.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.709
You're right.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.667
(laughing):
Where you going?

30:06.750 --> 30:09.709
Ireland.

30:09.792 --> 30:10.375
(knocking on door)

30:10.458 --> 30:12.667
Yeah, come in.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.041
(door opens)

30:17.542 --> 30:19.458
You look like shit.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.917
What do you want?

30:23.291 --> 30:26.208
I wanted to invite you
and Donna over tonight.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.709
We haven't played Scrabble
in a while.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.667
Uh, sorry, Tom, but, uh,

30:30.750 --> 30:33.375
there's not gonna be
any more Scrabble.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.417
I, uh, just spoke
with Megan.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.458
She really wants to play.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.709
What's wrong?

30:42.792 --> 30:46.041
You really hurt Donna's feelings
last time, Tom.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.834
And she cried.

30:49.333 --> 30:52.792
She thinks
you don't find her attractive.

30:52.875 --> 30:54.333
(sighs)

30:54.417 --> 30:56.417
I'm sorry, sir.

30:56.500 --> 31:00.250
You know, Tom...

31:00.333 --> 31:02.959
when Donna's not happy,
I'm not happy.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.125
(sighs)

31:29.083 --> 31:30.250
(sighs)

31:30.333 --> 31:32.500
Okay.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.250
(beep)

31:35.417 --> 31:37.625
See me?

31:37.709 --> 31:39.250
Now, don't laugh...

31:40.875 --> 31:41.667
Watch.

31:41.750 --> 31:46.000
I was a stripper
one summer in Eilat.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.583
(singing jaunty tune)

31:47.667 --> 31:50.417
Learn something here, okay?

31:50.500 --> 31:51.959
Get out of here.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.542
Eliminate the ALT.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.917
That other version of yourself.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.792
The pleaser,
the nice person.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.875
You're wasting your energy!

32:01.959 --> 32:03.000
And why?

32:03.083 --> 32:06.500
Is that how you want
to be described?

32:06.583 --> 32:08.542
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

32:08.625 --> 32:10.500
As nice?

32:10.583 --> 32:14.041
(laughter)

32:14.125 --> 32:16.250
Guys?

32:16.333 --> 32:18.458
Ten minute break.

32:18.542 --> 32:19.417
No phones, no texts.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.333
Stay on the path.

32:22.417 --> 32:24.500
(applause)

32:28.250 --> 32:29.500
How did it go, brother?

32:29.583 --> 32:32.792
It went fine.

32:32.875 --> 32:36.208
Yes! I knew you could handle it.

32:36.291 --> 32:40.750
Now, how do I know this isn't
going to come back and fuck me?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.917
Manuel's on a flight
to Guatemala tonight.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.333
He'll be on a no-fly list
tomorrow.

32:45.417 --> 32:47.583
I want to kneel at your feet.

32:48.875 --> 32:52.208
(sighs)
Don't do that.

32:52.291 --> 32:53.875
I see the god
in you, Ray.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.750
I have to acknowledge
who you are.

32:55.834 --> 32:57.000
Come on, get up.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.041
Why does my love make you
uncomfortable?

32:59.125 --> 33:02.250
I don't know, maybe it's
the headset-- come on.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.291
(both laugh)

33:04.375 --> 33:06.291
This arrangement is
already a winner.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.792
Who do I make the check out to?
Goldman/Drexler?

33:08.875 --> 33:10.500
No. Me. Hundred grand.

33:10.583 --> 33:13.500
No problem.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.625
A month.

33:15.709 --> 33:18.083
Plus what
you're paying out to Manuel.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.250
What do I get for that?

33:23.333 --> 33:25.125
Whatever you need.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.750
I'll have my lawyer draft
an agreement.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.959
You know, those people--

33:33.041 --> 33:36.458
they could learn a lot
from you, Ray.

33:36.542 --> 33:38.333
I'll be in touch.

33:45.875 --> 33:48.041
Ray...

33:49.500 --> 33:52.417
It's signed.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.417
It saved my life.

33:57.041 --> 33:58.166
(phone buzzes)

34:00.667 --> 34:02.667
Yeah, Av.

34:02.750 --> 34:03.917
AVI:
Yeah, boss, we have a problem.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.625
Will you just get
this fucking equipment

34:06.709 --> 34:07.458
out of my house right now?

34:07.542 --> 34:10.959
RAY:
What's up?
It's bad. Yes.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.333
I forgot to put
my family's from Dingle.

34:13.417 --> 34:15.875
Oh.

34:15.959 --> 34:18.709
What's prompted you
to move to Ireland?

34:18.792 --> 34:21.041
I just...
I just want to.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.083
I need to put down a reason.

34:23.166 --> 34:24.959
It's beautiful there.

34:25.041 --> 34:26.792
So you've been?

34:26.875 --> 34:28.125
No.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.291
Oh.

34:31.542 --> 34:35.291
I see there you have a
preexisting medical condition.

34:35.375 --> 34:38.250
I got Parkinson's.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.375
We have socialized
medicine in Ireland.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.667
You're aware
of that?
No.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.750
There are occasions
when we've had people attempt

34:46.834 --> 34:48.792
to emigrate in order
to take advantage...

34:48.875 --> 34:50.375
I'm not a freeloader!

34:52.333 --> 34:54.667
My fiancée's a nurse.
That's very good.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.834
Nurse. We need nurses.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.125
So, what do you do?

34:59.208 --> 35:00.750
Got a boxing gym.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.625
You own the
business?

35:02.709 --> 35:04.583
With my brother.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.625
Oh. Well, that is good news.

35:06.709 --> 35:08.709
We welcome business owners.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.500
Innocent everyman,
murder he didn't commit,

35:15.583 --> 35:19.250
goes to jail, when a movie star
shows up in a helicopter

35:19.333 --> 35:21.125
to break him out
of the prison yard...

35:21.208 --> 35:22.166
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.834
Why was Sean
even interested in this?

35:23.917 --> 35:28.834
He was interested in me.

35:28.917 --> 35:30.875
Go ahead.

35:30.959 --> 35:32.375
You have my attention.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.041
I consulted on Black Mass.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.208
Grew up on the streets
of Southie.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.959
Started dealing drugs
when I was 17 years old.

35:41.041 --> 35:44.625
Did 20 years in the can.
Walpole.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.709
Really?
That's right.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.959
Was one of Sully Sullivan's
closest associates.

35:49.041 --> 35:50.041
There's already ten Sully
projects already going.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.875
We actually just
dropped ours.

35:52.959 --> 35:54.417
What else you got?

35:58.125 --> 36:00.750
Well, they say,
write about what you know?

36:00.834 --> 36:02.583
I know two things.

36:02.667 --> 36:05.500
Robbing banks
and fucking black chicks.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.667
(laughs)

36:10.083 --> 36:11.500
Let's see where that goes.

36:15.834 --> 36:16.875
STEVE (on audiobook):
...this minute that's

36:16.959 --> 36:19.542
getting in your way,

36:19.625 --> 36:22.792
that's keeping you
from being your authentic self--

36:22.875 --> 36:24.375
Own it.

36:24.458 --> 36:26.667
Run right to it.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.250
Stop listening to the voice...

36:28.333 --> 36:30.208
(CD ejecting)

36:30.291 --> 36:33.375
(phone chimes)

36:33.458 --> 36:35.125
(phone line ringing)

36:35.208 --> 36:36.709
(over phone):
Hey, this is Abby Donovan.

36:36.792 --> 36:38.959
I can't answer your call.
Please leave a message.

36:39.041 --> 36:40.417
(voicemail beeps)

36:40.500 --> 36:41.542
Hey, it's me.

36:43.417 --> 36:47.291
I, uh... I should have told you
about Bridget.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.917
I should have told you
about a lot of things.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.125
Look, I've...

36:52.208 --> 36:55.041
I've been really nuts
trying to get this house, Abs,

36:55.125 --> 36:58.333
and I know
that's not an excuse, but...

37:00.041 --> 37:02.667
...meet me tonight for dinner.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.750
Sofia's.

37:04.834 --> 37:07.667
8:30.

37:07.750 --> 37:10.875
I'll be there.

37:10.959 --> 37:11.959
Frances! Fran...

37:12.041 --> 37:14.417
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.875
Yeah, uh, it's okay.
It's okay.

37:15.959 --> 37:17.125
What are you doing?

37:17.208 --> 37:18.917
Are you trying
to get me fired?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.959
What is this? What?

37:21.041 --> 37:22.625
It's the Immigrant
Investor Program.

37:22.709 --> 37:23.959
Ireland?
Yeah, Ireland.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.250
I'm gonna sell my gym.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.041
They need business
owners like me.

37:26.125 --> 37:28.208
They need
nurses, too.
Terry...

37:28.291 --> 37:30.792
Let me finish.
$687,200.
Okay.

37:30.875 --> 37:31.667
We start a business
with that,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.333
we can become
citizens immediately.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.083
You are out
of your mind.
Frances.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.000
Frances, please.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.542
I have a family.
I have a son.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.333
Jason's 18.
He's going off to college.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.250
You'll only see him
once a year anyway.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.458
But he can come visit us.
Every summer.

37:46.542 --> 37:47.709
I'll rent a castle.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.125
I can't decide this
right now, okay?

37:49.208 --> 37:50.333
I-I need to think about it.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.250
Christ, I have a patient
in the other room!

37:52.333 --> 37:55.333
You don't love your husband.
You love me.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.125
You said that.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.083
Oh, my God.

38:00.166 --> 38:02.208
You're the love of my life.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.166
Come to Ireland.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.750
Come to Ireland and marry me.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.625
(knocking on door)

38:14.208 --> 38:16.375
He says the
plan is off.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.375
Take your microphones
and cameras--

38:21.458 --> 38:23.166
get 'em out of my walls, please.

38:26.458 --> 38:27.875
What happened?

38:27.959 --> 38:29.417
Cochran said no.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.000
It's not gonna work.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.667
Why not?

38:34.750 --> 38:35.875
It's Donna.

38:35.959 --> 38:38.750
She knows that I don't like
making love to her, and...

38:38.834 --> 38:40.542
offended her.

38:42.333 --> 38:42.834
(quiet chuckle)

38:42.917 --> 38:45.250
He told you that?

38:45.333 --> 38:47.917
It's not funny.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.083
So just get your shit

38:49.166 --> 38:50.000
and get out of here.
I mean it.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.500
Tom, listen to me.

38:53.834 --> 38:55.250
Sooner or later,
Cochran's gonna get bored

38:55.333 --> 38:57.625
with the two of you
and move on.

38:57.709 --> 38:58.959
When that happens,

38:59.041 --> 39:02.083
you think he wants you
hanging around to remind him?

39:02.166 --> 39:04.208
Huh?

39:07.542 --> 39:09.625
But Megan and I are gonna
be on that tape.

39:09.709 --> 39:11.417
I told you,
we take care of that.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.250
Blur your faces.

39:17.667 --> 39:18.834
You're a smart guy, Tom.

39:18.917 --> 39:20.583
There's only
one play here.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.041
Fuck him before
he fucks you.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.417
Now pick up that phone

39:25.500 --> 39:26.583
and call her.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.542
(phone rings)

39:39.875 --> 39:41.709
Hello?

39:41.792 --> 39:43.417
Hey, it's Tom.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.500
Don't hang up, please.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.208
What do you want?

39:48.291 --> 39:51.542
Look, I know that
sometimes, in the past,

39:51.625 --> 39:54.291
it's felt like maybe
I was holding back.

39:55.667 --> 39:56.917
But there's a reason.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.250
Yeah, what is it?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.208
This is hard for me
to say, but...

40:00.291 --> 40:01.959
You remind me of a girl.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.750
From high school.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.041
We were in love and...

40:07.125 --> 40:09.250
she broke my heart.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.333
Well, sorry about that.

40:13.417 --> 40:15.125
Well, it... it isn't fair,

40:15.208 --> 40:17.792
letting it affect you.

40:17.875 --> 40:18.500
(whispers):
You want to fuck her.

40:20.291 --> 40:22.667
Please forgive me, but...

40:22.750 --> 40:24.750
I really want to fuck you.

40:24.834 --> 40:26.500
Tonight.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.375
Really, sweetie?

40:31.667 --> 40:33.750
'Cause I really
want to fuck you, too.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.333
Where you going?

40:42.417 --> 40:44.500
Out.

40:46.458 --> 40:49.041
I'm really sorry
about this morning, Mama.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.333
I was really angry.

40:54.583 --> 40:55.709
I accept your apology.

41:11.792 --> 41:13.041
Jesus, that feels good.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.083
(chuckles)

41:15.166 --> 41:18.125
Doesn't it?

41:18.208 --> 41:20.291
Okay...

41:22.125 --> 41:23.625
I'm gonna rinse.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.792
Keep your eyes closed, okay?

41:39.375 --> 41:42.291
I'm gonna dry you off.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.125
Okay.

41:44.208 --> 41:44.625
Okay.

42:23.458 --> 42:26.125
How do you feel now?

42:31.333 --> 42:32.667
Better than I've felt
in a long time.

42:35.959 --> 42:37.041
Yeah?
Yeah.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.375
Uh...

42:39.792 --> 42:41.875
Can I use your
bathroom?

42:41.959 --> 42:43.125
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's, uh, it's right there.

42:43.208 --> 42:46.000
Okay.
Okay.

42:59.208 --> 43:00.458
Hey, Ray.

43:00.542 --> 43:01.583
Hey.

43:01.667 --> 43:03.458
Saw that you
were coming in.

43:03.542 --> 43:04.667
Meeting my wife.

43:07.875 --> 43:08.750
This way.

43:17.625 --> 43:19.208
Thanks.

43:19.291 --> 43:21.375
Sure.

43:44.208 --> 43:47.041
(rustling)

44:04.417 --> 44:05.333
(door closes)

44:05.417 --> 44:08.041
CLIFFORD:
Mom, I'm home.

44:08.125 --> 44:10.208
PATTY: Cliff, honey... honey,
what are you doing here?

44:10.291 --> 44:12.458
Is everything okay?
No, no, no. No.

44:12.542 --> 44:13.458
(knocking on door)

44:13.542 --> 44:14.417
(clears throat)

44:14.500 --> 44:17.667
Yeah?
Hey. Cliff's home.

44:17.750 --> 44:19.625
He wet the bed.
I'm so sorry.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.417
Timing could have been
a lot worse. (laughs)

44:21.500 --> 44:22.667
Yeah.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.750
Cliff, honey, let's take a
little bath and put some PJs on.

44:27.959 --> 44:29.875
You remember Bunchy.
Say hi.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.417
Hi. I had an accident.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.333
Okay.

44:33.417 --> 44:35.417
That's all right.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
Come on.

44:37.583 --> 44:39.208
Let's get you
out of those clothes.

44:39.291 --> 44:41.208
(growls playfully)

44:41.291 --> 44:43.667
One, two, three.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.333
It says here...

44:49.417 --> 44:52.250
"the hero always crosses water

44:52.333 --> 44:53.959
in the beginning."

44:54.041 --> 44:55.750
Really?

44:55.834 --> 44:57.041
"They did it

44:57.125 --> 44:59.250
"with Moses,

44:59.333 --> 45:02.000
"King Arthur...

45:02.083 --> 45:04.709
and 'O-ed-i-pus.'"

45:04.792 --> 45:07.458
I did dump a body
in the Boston Harbor once.

45:07.542 --> 45:11.041
(chuckles)
That's your opening.

45:13.458 --> 45:14.959
Ray's gonna learn--
can't hold me down.

45:18.417 --> 45:20.375
You know, Sean Walker
said that every page

45:20.458 --> 45:22.625
is supposed to be a minute,

45:22.709 --> 45:23.750
but I can't see
how that's true.

45:23.834 --> 45:26.625
With this opening
I'm gonna have three...

45:26.709 --> 45:28.583
three scenes on the first page.

45:28.667 --> 45:30.208
Every one seems like it's
gonna be at least a minute.

45:30.291 --> 45:34.500
This is too hard.

45:34.583 --> 45:35.959
Why don't we do that heist?

45:36.041 --> 45:37.333
We could go in
through the roof.

45:37.417 --> 45:38.458
See, that I understand.

45:38.542 --> 45:40.166
Not this pipe dream.

45:40.250 --> 45:42.625
Pipe dream?!

45:42.709 --> 45:45.041
Get the fuck
out of here, pipe dream.

45:45.125 --> 45:47.583
It's as real as your cancer.

45:51.250 --> 45:54.333
(sighs)

46:07.250 --> 46:08.250
(door closes)

46:08.333 --> 46:10.834
Shit.

46:10.917 --> 46:12.083
(on TV):
Okay, you asked for it.

46:16.667 --> 46:18.625
(alien grunting on TV)

46:18.709 --> 46:20.375
(soft laugh)

46:20.458 --> 46:23.041
(on TV): Now Cosmic Kevin
is gonna make you pay!

46:23.125 --> 46:24.834
(alien grunts)

46:26.083 --> 46:29.250
Banana peel kick!

46:29.333 --> 46:30.375
(Kevin laughing)

46:30.458 --> 46:32.250
Chicken drumstick kick.

46:32.333 --> 46:36.542
ALIEN:
Oh!

46:36.625 --> 46:38.375
(cartoon continues
indistinctly)

46:57.667 --> 47:00.375
(phone keypad blipping)

47:00.458 --> 47:03.875
(line rings)

47:03.959 --> 47:05.041
Hey, this is Abby Donovan.

47:05.125 --> 47:07.417
I can't answer your call.
Please leave a message.

47:07.500 --> 47:10.375
(phone beeps off)

47:17.333 --> 47:18.667
Hey, Ray.

47:18.750 --> 47:19.750
Hi.

47:19.834 --> 47:20.959
Can I get you
anything else?

47:23.583 --> 47:24.709
No, thank you.

47:24.792 --> 47:26.083
Let me know if you

47:26.166 --> 47:28.291
change your mind.

47:47.041 --> 47:47.750
(laughs)

47:47.834 --> 47:50.709
Oh, mister,
you're almost done.

47:51.792 --> 47:52.959
Not until you hit
a bull's-eye.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.333
(scoffs)

47:58.417 --> 47:59.750
Threw me off.
I should get a do-over.

47:59.834 --> 48:02.667
Am I really that distracting?

48:05.333 --> 48:07.166
Maybe, yeah.

48:20.750 --> 48:23.542
You're so fucking beautiful.

48:23.625 --> 48:25.709
Holy shit.

48:32.625 --> 48:36.083
(passionate breathing
over speakers)

48:36.166 --> 48:39.166
COCHRAN:
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

48:40.750 --> 48:42.000
(phone buzzes quietly)

48:42.083 --> 48:45.208
(passionate moaning)
Oh, yeah...

48:45.291 --> 48:45.959
Yeah?

48:46.041 --> 48:47.875
HARRIET:
We have a problem.

48:47.959 --> 48:49.083
What?

48:49.166 --> 48:50.709
I just got a call
from your brother.

48:50.792 --> 48:51.792
He wants to sell the gym, Ray.

48:51.875 --> 48:55.000
What are you talking about?

48:55.083 --> 48:56.333
I just spoke to him.

48:56.417 --> 48:57.834
It's something about
moving to Ireland.

48:57.917 --> 49:00.166
You told me this day
would never come.

49:00.250 --> 49:02.333
You promised me.
I'll take care of it.

49:02.417 --> 49:05.250
Goddamn it, Ray, now this
is my ass on the line, too.

49:07.959 --> 49:09.333
(grunts)
Yeah.

49:09.417 --> 49:11.792
