00:03.083 --> 00:04.717
Previously on <i>Rogue</i>...

00:04.802 --> 00:06.636
- Where do they want these?
- Cheat's place.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.274
Which means they want me
to fuck 'em.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.147
What are you doing?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.917
'Grace, it's me.
I'm at Cheat's.

00:16.951 --> 00:17.984
Everything's fucked!'

00:18.019 --> 00:21.454
Remember my U.C.?
I told you about her. Sarah.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.624
- Is she dead?
- Yeah. Yeah, we think so.

00:24.659 --> 00:26.927
And they want me
to go back undercover.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.030
They're onto us, Ray.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.766
They found the money, soon
they'll know everything.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.137
- Jesus!
- Hey, Julian.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.005
How have you been?

00:39.040 --> 00:42.275
- What else you wanna know?
- Everything the Feds don't want us to.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.710
Your guys paid me a visit.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.912
- What did you tell them?
- 'Nothing.'

00:45.947 --> 00:48.815
But they know about your operation,
that you're tracking the money.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.984
'I've been on the phone,
I think I got what you asked for.'

00:51.018 --> 00:52.452
You found the money?

00:52.486 --> 00:56.056
Those marked bills are showing
up in a nexus in Vancouver, Canada.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.024
Vancouver?
That's where Sarah is.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.360
We find the bank and get
an address for her.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.115
Grace, it's me, I'm at Cheat's.
Everything's fucked!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.917
They're after me, Grace, they're
after me.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.220
Leave me alone!

03:53.300 --> 03:55.168
Let's get these open for you.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.211
Welcome to Vancouver.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.089
All my friends at Vassar...

04:18.492 --> 04:20.326
..getting married and...

04:22.029 --> 04:23.763
..having kids.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.136
Just so excited about becoming
the vice presidents of mediocrity.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.510
And I just keep thinking...

04:41.248 --> 04:42.749
Don't settle for that.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.353
There's gotta be something more,
right?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.757
I mean, it is a big,
big, big world.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.060
You chose Canada.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.962
Mm, yeah.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.966
Do you wanna turn over?

05:10.177 --> 05:11.978
I just want to see everything.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.815
Don't you?

05:24.225 --> 05:25.391
Oh!

05:29.230 --> 05:30.296
Ohh!

06:24.618 --> 06:26.686
Hello, Sarah.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.124
Looking good for a dead girl.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.408
I think I'm owed
some kind of explanation.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.276
About what?

06:50.311 --> 06:51.611
I dunno.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.580
Stealing Chetowski's money...

06:54.582 --> 06:56.416
faking your own death.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.085
I didn't steal anybody's money.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.559
Don't fuck me around!

07:06.594 --> 07:08.428
I'm not in the mood.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.230
We tracked every dollar
that you spent.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.434
Cheat gave me that money.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.102
He gave you $2.5 million?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.905
No, don't be ridiculous.
It was ten grand.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.874
He was high and...

07:21.909 --> 07:24.177
showing off, throwing it around.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.845
So where is it?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.747
I spent it.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.317
You guys missed the party.

07:31.352 --> 07:33.119
You sure about that?

07:34.421 --> 07:36.222
You don't believe me.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.858
Go ask him.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.128
We'd like to. But it's difficult,
him being dead and all.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.199
News to me.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.401
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.204
You know he's dead.

07:53.374 --> 07:54.641
I do now.

07:54.675 --> 07:58.177
You called me, pretending that
you were in trouble,

07:58.212 --> 08:01.180
right before making us think you
had been murdered

08:01.215 --> 08:03.082
and dumped in the Narrows.

08:03.117 --> 08:04.917
Are you gonna lie
about that too?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.253
No, I... I didn't want you
coming after me.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.289
It's not a crime.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.858
Look it up.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.726
How about obstruction
of justice,

08:13.761 --> 08:15.862
dereliction of duty,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.730
not to mention grand theft,
Sarah.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.766
Where is the money, Sarah?

08:20.467 --> 08:22.268
Like I said, I spent it.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.071
Fine.
I'll get a search warrant.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.440
Fine. I'll get a lawyer.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.849
So, let me get this straight.

08:36.884 --> 08:42.255
You allege that my client stole
$2.5 million and faked her own death?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.157
- That's correct.
- Wow.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.492
Sounds like
an industrious woman.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.696
I'm assuming there's an outstanding arrest
warrant in the United States

08:49.730 --> 08:51.431
for such an audacious crime?

08:51.465 --> 08:54.267
Well, we've just found out that
she's alive.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.935
We came to talk to her.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.970
Oh, okay.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.939
Well, then, you get the warrant
over there,

09:00.174 --> 09:02.875
then I'm sure our wonderful
Vancouver P.D.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.446
will be more than helpful in expeditiously
issuing a warrant over here,

09:06.480 --> 09:10.316
then my client will be more than
happy to surrender herself for questioning.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.952
Then I can tell everybody how I
had to flee the country

09:12.986 --> 09:16.222
to stop the FBI from forcing me
to prostitute myself.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.958
We haven't found anything.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.993
Well, then, my client's
free to go.

09:29.203 --> 09:31.003
We're not letting her just walk
out of here.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.973
It'll take a couple
of hours to get a warrant.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.443
We put her under surveillance.
She is not going anywhere.

09:37.478 --> 09:39.412
This is bullshit.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.814
I went back undercover for you.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.250
I risked my life.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.520
I didn't ask you to come after
me.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.523
I think that concludes
our current business.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.064
How are you so calm?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.299
How can you not be furious about
this?

10:00.334 --> 10:04.203
I don't have to deal with serial killers,
rapists or bombs in the subway.

10:04.238 --> 10:06.472
Just a selfish girl
who stole some money.

10:06.507 --> 10:08.407
This is as pleasant
as my job gets.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.845
She lied to us.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.947
That's what criminals do.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.183
Yeah, we put our lives
on hold for her.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.386
I told you about making
this a crusade.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.723
You set yourself up
to be disappointed.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.092
Right, thanks for
the psychoanalysis.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.428
You want some food?

10:29.463 --> 10:30.530
No.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.466
No, I'm gonna keep
an eye on her.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.968
You have no jurisdiction here,
Grace.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.071
Then I'll just sit and watch.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.889
We should go to the movies.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.592
I can't. I have a client
in half an hour.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.561
How come you don't have to work?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.803
The last guy I was banging
overdosed on blow.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.706
So I stole his cash.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.975
You're joking, right?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.579
Excuse me.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.917
Hey. Hey, where's she going?

11:24.952 --> 11:27.153
Bathroom?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.211
Hey, get over here.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.651
Get in the fucking car.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.030
Fuck!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.700
It's very simple.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.736
You give us the money
and we let you go.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.571
What money?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.548
Oh, that money.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.886
Yeah, that fucking money.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.589
You know the cops
are looking for me.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.926
If I were you,
I'd start running.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.260
Oh, what, the Mounties?

12:41.295 --> 12:43.162
They still think
you're taking a shit.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.164
Hey, Sarah.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.700
Nobody knows you're here.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.102
I'm the only one who knows where
the money is.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.805
So you kill me,
you'll never find it.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.974
I can live with that.
That's fine.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.442
What?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.978
The money's evidence.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.880
If we've got it - great.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.983
If it's lost forever, that's second best.
But what I can't have...

13:04.017 --> 13:06.986
is someone running round
spending it, bringing the Feds down on us.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.589
I'm wedded to the money,
but after the shit you put us through,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.893
option number two is starting to
look a lot more attractive.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.698
I'm a cop, you idiots.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.967
Yeah, and I'm the starting
forward for the Warriors.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.870
Part of an undercover investigation
looking into your friend Cheat.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.440
And after I led the post-season in
triple-doubles,

13:27.474 --> 13:28.975
Doris Burke blew me
in the press box.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.077
Daniel Chetowski.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.146
Born August 5th, 1978, Brooklyn.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.817
Arrests for burglary, possession
of narcotics,

13:37.851 --> 13:39.685
grand theft auto,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.121
two terms in Afghanistan.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.090
You want me to keep on going?

13:46.226 --> 13:50.496
If you kill me, you can't even imagine
the shitstorm you'll bring on yourselves.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.499
What's new?

13:55.602 --> 13:56.936
Look.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.904
It's very simple.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.708
You give us the money...
and you live.

14:02.743 --> 14:04.110
Mm.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.045
It's no good to you anyway.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.913
It's been pretty good to me so
far.

14:08.749 --> 14:11.150
It's flagged. How do you
think they found you?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.119
If that's true,
why do you want it?

14:14.888 --> 14:15.988
Because it's mine.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.690
Gonna stick to that?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.326
Let me tell you something,
honey.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.096
It sure as shit ain't yours.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.336
Where is it?

14:35.876 --> 14:37.543
Gonna shoot me in a hotel room?

14:40.814 --> 14:41.947
I dunno.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.449
Are we?

14:52.059 --> 14:54.126
We put out an A.P.B.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.861
That makes me feel
so much better.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.998
And we've notified forces in
Surrey, Richmond and Langley.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.900
Are they any better
than you guys?

15:00.934 --> 15:04.737
They'd notice if one of
their colleagues faked their own death.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.077
'With cutbacks, we have to
ensure all the desks are covered.'

15:11.111 --> 15:13.379
'Even if that means doubling up?'

15:13.413 --> 15:15.347
'I don't see
what choice we have.'

15:18.051 --> 15:20.052
Yeah, Agent Howe.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.259
What?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.029
It's Elliot.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.964
Give me a minute.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.537
Hello, Elliot.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.174
Jesus Christ! Sarah's alive and I have
to hear it from the fucking Canadians?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.243
Things moved very quickly.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.011
How am I not your first call?

15:46.046 --> 15:48.247
I wanted to be sure
before I brought you in.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.083
No, you wanted to be sure before
you sidelined me.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.918
You're being paranoid.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.887
How in the hell
is she still alive?

15:55.922 --> 15:58.190
- 'Where is she now?'
- We're closing in on her.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.159
You know what?
This is on you now.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.162
So don't fucking come back
without her.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.365
Everything okay?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.834
Fine. Politics.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.171
Let's go.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.013
The bank opens at 9am.
We go first thing.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.214
Okay.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.950
Shotgun the bed, unless
you two want to be alone.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.022
Let me ask you a question.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.225
Is it this key for
the safety deposit box?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.095
No?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.130
What about this one?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.434
It's this one? Good.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.439
Look, they're not gonna
let anybody into the vault but me.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.808
You might as well
just let me hold onto those.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.145
Well, I don't want you running
off in the night.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.247
Hadn't crossed my mind.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.792
So how's business?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.930
You guys are, what, mall cops?

17:14.968 --> 17:16.835
Where's that little guy?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.271
Oh, sorry. Littler guy.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.173
So you fucked Cheat, right?

17:22.474 --> 17:24.108
What is that, part of your job?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.180
They teach you that
at police academy?

17:31.084 --> 17:33.018
Sarah, why were they
investigating?

17:33.053 --> 17:36.322
Because the Mayor wanted to give
him a key to the city.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.794
You know, I can't imagine they'd
send you in there to do...

17:43.230 --> 17:45.097
..what do you call it,
your job...

17:45.131 --> 17:47.132
if it wasn't
something important.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.202
I can call the F.B.I.
and we can ask them.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.974
This was a Federal
Investigation?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.045
Looking a little pale there,
precious.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.515
Why would the Feds
give a shit about Cheat? I don't buy it.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.453
Well, you really strike me
as an expert legal mind.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.054
I'm smart enough to catch you.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.091
I suspect you're not the brains
behind this operation.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.427
You don't wanna know what I
fucking do for the operation.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.796
Why were the Feds
interested in Cheat?

18:17.831 --> 18:21.967
Because he was identified as
patient zero in a syphilis outbreak.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.471
Right.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.172
You know what?

18:27.207 --> 18:31.076
Why don't you just go on ahead
and fucking tell me?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.645
Aaargh! Aargh!

18:39.085 --> 18:40.319
Fucking bitch!

18:40.353 --> 18:42.755
Ray, calm down, calm down.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.496
I'm gonna fucking kill her.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.033
Come on, Ray, she barely
punctured the skin.

18:54.067 --> 18:57.303
Spud was right, though.
The Feds are onto us.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.371
I'm serious, Ethan.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.407
She's not walking out
of here after that.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.709
I'm not cleaning up your fucking
messes any more.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.311
My fucking mess?
That bitch stole from us.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.413
Are you forgetting how we got it
in the first place?

19:07.447 --> 19:10.783
I remember how we got it.
You messed that one up.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.155
The last thing we need, Ray,

19:16.189 --> 19:18.023
is another dead body
on our hands.

19:18.058 --> 19:21.126
You wanna start anew with Donna
and the kids, do you?

19:22.128 --> 19:25.631
Or do you wanna kill a woman
that stabbed you with a butter knife?

19:27.067 --> 19:28.233
Look.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.169
We get the money.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.638
Then we get the hell
out of San Francisco.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.075
Do you want a coffee?

19:36.109 --> 19:37.910
Yeah, thanks.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.326
Yeah?

19:56.096 --> 19:57.396
Is Evie back yet?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.565
I haven't heard from her.

20:02.102 --> 20:04.002
You got to call her for me.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.138
Just to see if she's okay.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.274
'Cause she's not answering any
of my calls.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.078
I'm sure she's fine, Grace.

20:13.113 --> 20:15.414
She just needs a little time to
forgive you.

20:17.117 --> 20:18.617
You know this is your fault.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.622
You and Evie were fighting a
long time before I turned up.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.191
You lied to her about me.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.161
You have your version,
I have mine.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.097
Fine.

20:32.132 --> 20:33.966
Have your version.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.705
Grace?

20:40.407 --> 20:41.974
What?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.643
What is there left to say?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.436
There you go.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.137
Grace?

21:12.172 --> 21:13.539
Yeah.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.974
Thank you.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.081
I didn't tell Elliot
that we found Sarah.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.253
I get the feeling you don't tell
him a lot of things.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.322
Yeah.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.026
What's the deal with you two,
anyway?

21:34.694 --> 21:37.029
Nothing you haven't
already worked out.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.935
Well, at least you got something
out of this assignment.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.171
I'm not so sure it was worth it.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.608
He's probably packing my desk
into boxes right now.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.012
Well, my daughter's
just moved in with my ex

21:54.047 --> 21:56.281
and his pregnant new girlfriend.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.952
You win.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.154
Yeah.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.056
I deserve a medal.

22:08.495 --> 22:13.966
As much as I want to blame Sarah
for making me go back undercover and...

22:16.369 --> 22:18.303
..taking me away
from my family...

22:22.008 --> 22:24.076
..the truth is,
I was happy to be back.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.114
'Cause I missed it.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.886
I missed being someone else.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.027
After you.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.032
Sorry, sir. Key holders only
beyond this point.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.537
Hurry on back now, sweetie.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.435
It's short, about 20 grand.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.705
Well, a girl's gotta eat.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.707
Get out. Walk away.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.776
And don't look back, Sarah.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.684
That's what I was thinking.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.655
You think this is the first time
I've had a gun in my face?

24:49.689 --> 24:51.556
You want it to be the last?

24:53.159 --> 24:55.093
- Give me your gun.
- I don't have it.

24:55.128 --> 24:57.029
Give me your fucking gun now.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.169
Get out of the car.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.606
Get out of the fucking car now!
Ethan, you stay.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.392
Alright, get over here now,
where I can see you.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.796
Move!

25:30.830 --> 25:32.798
Get the fuck over here, faster!

25:37.470 --> 25:41.073
Okay, Ethan, get out of the car,
leave the keys in the ignition.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.579
Move! Move! Move!

25:49.449 --> 25:51.683
You spend it and they'll
find you again, Sarah.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.452
Then I'll launder it.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.192
You know, you're getting pretty
good at this criminal stuff.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.027
Agh!

26:03.463 --> 26:04.696
Argh!

26:07.366 --> 26:08.700
Okay, Ray.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.536
Ray! Ray, let her go!

26:12.638 --> 26:14.206
Ray, goddamn it!

26:15.308 --> 26:16.274
Let her go!

26:59.085 --> 27:00.352
Shit!

27:09.996 --> 27:12.464
Yeah, Travis.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.900
Grace, they're after me,
you gotta help me.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.435
Yeah, very fucking funny, Sarah.

27:18.538 --> 27:21.606
I'm at 8277 Manitoba Street.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.676
They're here, they're armed.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.711
Who? Who's here?

27:26.946 --> 27:29.414
Cheat's friends, 8277...

27:32.618 --> 27:37.022
- We've got to get a car
to 8277 Manitoba Street. - Got it.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.757
Kelly and Williams are in town.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.673
Agh!

28:29.075 --> 28:30.342
Fuck!

28:57.703 --> 28:59.104
- Take it easy.
- Ray's inside.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.851
Watch your head.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.887
Kelly's in the car. Go!

29:28.034 --> 29:29.968
- Alright.
- Yes, sir.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.005
Yeah, here.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.474
Where in the hell
is Kelly and Williams?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.482
Make sure that thing
is nailed to the floor.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.063
Well, you have been
very popular lately.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.999
- Not by design.
- Oh, yeah?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.069
Did Ray and Ethan come looking
for their money?

30:05.538 --> 30:07.906
I told them what I told you. I
don't know where it is.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.308
You lying ungrateful sack of...

30:10.543 --> 30:11.843
Travis.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.917
You're gonna tell me exactly
what happened that night.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.119
It's like I told them.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.555
It's really not that exciting.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.624
Cheat gave me ten grand,
I went on a little vacation.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.929
- Well earned. - She's been sticking to
that story the whole way.

30:30.963 --> 30:34.833
Apparently saving her life hasn't made
her any less of a pain in the ass.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.268
Alright, let's leave this.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.106
Leni, I want to talk.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.055
I've been thinking about this
because of our history together.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.024
And what history is that?

30:59.058 --> 31:03.294
I'm gonna let you resign quietly.
That's the last time you undermine me.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.597
- You hear me?
- I wouldn't count on that.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.966
Clear your desk and get
the fuck out of here.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.804
It's good to see you,
Deputy Director.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.975
Agent Howe.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.210
Sir.

31:19.245 --> 31:23.114
I thought I'd come down and congratulate
you on finding your dead operative.

31:24.850 --> 31:25.884
Thank you.

31:26.986 --> 31:30.989
I heard you also almost recovered
some of that stolen money as well.

31:31.824 --> 31:33.825
- Yeah, well, I'm...
- So close.

31:33.859 --> 31:35.460
I'm just er...

31:35.494 --> 31:39.097
I was just getting up to speed. I was going
to call your office in the morning.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.232
Well, I saved you the call.

31:42.034 --> 31:45.170
I voiced my reservations about
retaining Kastner from the start.

31:45.204 --> 31:48.306
She's been deliberately
acting without my authority.

31:48.541 --> 31:50.075
Wait a minute, I'm confused.

31:50.109 --> 31:54.813
From what I understand, Agent Kastner
discovered your operative was alive

31:54.847 --> 31:56.748
and brought her back
from Canada.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.883
Which part of that
don't you approve of?

32:00.453 --> 32:02.420
Better yet,
what have you approved of?

32:02.655 --> 32:03.922
What?

32:03.956 --> 32:06.191
What exactly are the taxpayers getting
for their money?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.293
They might've been
getting a lot more

32:08.327 --> 32:10.962
had you been straight with me
from the start.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.003
I see. I see.

32:21.874 --> 32:22.907
Kastner?

32:23.776 --> 32:25.677
Would you have problem running a
taskforce

32:25.711 --> 32:27.645
if you weren't privy
to all the information?

32:33.986 --> 32:35.687
No, sir.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.994
Well, then, I'd like you
to take over the taskforce.

32:43.028 --> 32:46.064
Elliot, you've been reassigned,
effective immediately.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.999
- You can't...
- I can't what?

32:51.904 --> 32:53.805
It's your show. Impress me.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.040
Good day, Elliot.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.123
This isn't about making arrests.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.960
Why don't you tell me
what it is you want,

33:15.995 --> 33:17.929
and let me deliver it for you?

33:19.999 --> 33:23.301
US Government sent money
to Afghanistan for reconstruction.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.070
Ethan Kelly and his buddies have
some of that money.

33:26.939 --> 33:29.374
What I want to know is,
did they steal it?

33:30.142 --> 33:32.243
And if not, how did they get it?

33:33.245 --> 33:34.979
So why the secrecy?

33:40.286 --> 33:42.120
It's politically sensitive.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.189
A lot of pensions
are riding on this.

33:44.223 --> 33:48.793
So it's critical that the findings of this
taskforce are never made public.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.061
You understand?

33:50.095 --> 33:51.930
You can trust me, sir.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.666
Oh, if Travis gets
out of hand...

33:55.734 --> 33:57.068
you bring down the hammer.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.238
Yes, sir.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.817
You know, you shouldn't take it
so personally, Grace.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.420
Not everything is about you.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.059
Fuck you.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.996
You never thought for a moment
about the chaos you would cause?

34:25.030 --> 34:29.067
You never thought that maybe
people actually give a shit about you?

34:32.905 --> 34:35.607
You never made a decision
in the moment that you regretted?

34:36.507 --> 34:37.909
Yeah.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.511
Coming after you.

34:43.148 --> 34:46.918
Officer Fannelli, we're arresting you
for the murder of Daniel Chetowski.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.053
What the fuck are you
talking about?

34:49.088 --> 34:50.922
You knew cheat
was a drug addict.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.023
So?

34:52.056 --> 34:54.225
So during the course
of your investigation,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.228
he told you about his money, and
you killed him for it.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.199
By what? By shoving coke
up his nose?

35:01.233 --> 35:02.900
Laced with fentanyl.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.037
You poisoned Cheat,

35:06.071 --> 35:09.207
on the same day you faked your
own death and fled the country.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.242
Motive, opportunity.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.211
That's not true
and you know that.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.746
Officer Fannelli...

35:17.950 --> 35:22.086
..we have no idea
what is true and what isn't.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.955
So why don't you tell us?

35:23.989 --> 35:26.257
And before you open
that mouth of yours,

35:26.292 --> 35:30.161
if I get even the slightest
sniff that you're lying to me,

35:30.195 --> 35:33.998
then I will have you charged
with murder one before the night's out.

35:35.034 --> 35:36.968
That means no bail.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.069
No parole.

35:39.071 --> 35:40.171
You just...

35:40.205 --> 35:41.906
disappear.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.620
What are you doing?

37:10.162 --> 37:11.429
Earring.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.216
My God.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.093
What did you do?

38:16.128 --> 38:17.361
What did you...

38:31.944 --> 38:34.078
I was never gonna
take that money.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.249
But when he started to die, he
was inside of me.

38:38.283 --> 38:43.020
All I could think of was that you fucking
people put me there! You used me.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.386
'My life was a mess and I had
nothing to go back to.'

39:16.288 --> 39:18.189
So I took a chance
to start again.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.224
But what, you never wanted that?

39:20.259 --> 39:22.059
You never wanted that?

39:22.094 --> 39:25.062
Just a chance to let it all go
and start over again?

40:12.344 --> 40:14.745
I'm sorry that I dragged you
through this.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.581
That's not what I wanted to do.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.683
I thought that...

40:21.920 --> 40:24.388
..you would just figure
I was dead and let it go,

40:24.423 --> 40:26.457
move on.

40:32.364 --> 40:35.566
Did Chetowski tell you
where he got the money?

40:37.803 --> 40:39.070
No.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.909
But Ray and Ethan...

40:46.712 --> 40:49.880
..were ready to kill me to stop
it from coming back on them.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.086
Is that it?

40:56.488 --> 40:58.522
Not even close.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.689
Charge her with obstruction.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.624
I'll be in touch.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.026
Sir.

41:39.564 --> 41:41.399
You okay?

41:42.668 --> 41:45.036
Yeah. Where's Elliot?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.740
He's been reassigned.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.545
What, so... congratulations?

41:57.416 --> 41:58.716
Yeah.

41:58.750 --> 41:59.917
Thanks.

42:02.220 --> 42:06.624
Look, we still don't know why Ethan Kelly
was giving money to those families.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.492
We're not done here.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.813
I guess you got everything you
wanted.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.449
I guess so.

42:36.188 --> 42:38.089
I thought we had a chance this
time.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.357
Really, Elliot?

42:40.392 --> 42:42.760
You hired me in case
you needed a scapegoat.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.764
I thought I could turn
it into a win.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.066
For us both.

42:49.301 --> 42:51.869
That's not what I'm mad about.
That's just the job.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.005
But sleeping with me while you
were doing it?

42:57.642 --> 42:59.343
You know what's sad?

42:59.377 --> 43:01.112
I thought we had a chance too.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.852
Have a safe trip back
to Washington.

43:33.645 --> 43:35.246
Is Evie home?

44:30.402 --> 44:32.002
When did she leave?

44:32.237 --> 44:34.471
I didn't want to tell you over
the phone.

44:36.708 --> 44:38.609
She at Tom's?

44:41.513 --> 44:42.913
She'll be back.

44:52.390 --> 44:54.058
Grace, I'm sorry.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.660
For what?

44:57.729 --> 45:00.231
I was the one supposed
to be looking after you.

45:01.666 --> 45:03.767
All I ever did was
think about myself.

45:10.876 --> 45:12.509
She took all her stuff.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.913
It's okay.

45:16.681 --> 45:17.915
It's okay.

45:25.590 --> 45:27.124
I'm a terrible mother.

45:27.158 --> 45:28.759
No.

45:31.863 --> 45:33.864
You didn't have
a very good example.

45:42.641 --> 45:43.974
It's okay.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.548
It's okay, honey.

45:59.457 --> 46:00.991
Ssh.

46:01.860 --> 46:04.028
It's okay, honey.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.875
How could you fucking
leave me like that?

46:17.909 --> 46:19.576
I told you not to go after her.

46:19.611 --> 46:21.478
You almost got us caught, Ray.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.248
What are you doing?

46:25.083 --> 46:27.151
We can't risk crossing
the border with this.

46:27.986 --> 46:31.088
That's $2.5 million. You're
gonna burn $2.5 million?

46:31.756 --> 46:34.191
Our prints are all over it.
We kidnapped a cop.

46:34.225 --> 46:37.394
We need to get back to the
States safely, understand?

46:37.429 --> 46:39.530
Then why the hell
did we come here?

46:39.998 --> 46:41.999
To stop the Feds
from getting it.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.534
Mission fucking accomplished.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.736
I'm not gonna let you
do that, Ethan.

46:46.271 --> 46:49.506
You know what? If you didn't go
after Sarah, we'd be fine.

46:49.541 --> 46:51.709
The cops have seen
our fucking faces!

46:53.111 --> 46:55.546
Now I'm stuck cleaning up your
goddamn mess again.

46:55.580 --> 46:56.947
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

46:56.982 --> 46:59.283
That means you don't
have a say anymore.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.948
I'm done listening.

47:34.819 --> 47:36.553
Well, good luck, Ray.

47:39.157 --> 47:41.392
I'm sure you'll do just fine on
your own.
