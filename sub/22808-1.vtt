01:25.836 --> 01:28.377
NARRATOR: This is Ash Ketchum,
from Pallet Town.

01:28.378 --> 01:32.381
Ash is almost ten years old.
When youngsters with aspirations

01:32.382 --> 01:35.805
to become Pokémon Trainers turn
ten, they can choose their first

01:35.806 --> 01:37.887
Pokémon from Professor Oak.

01:37.888 --> 01:40.890
They can choose from
Bulbasaur... Charmander...

01:40.891 --> 01:42.141
and Squirtle.

01:42.142 --> 01:44.724
Then, they can begin
their exciting journeys

01:44.725 --> 01:47.187
as Pokémon Trainers!

01:52.823 --> 01:59.328
ASH: Bulbasaur...
Charmander... Squirtle...

01:59.329 --> 02:05.666
Here we go.
All right, I choose you!

02:17.638 --> 02:19.759
DELIA: Ash Ketchum,
are you still asleep?

02:19.760 --> 02:22.471
You'll be late getting
to Professor Oak's lab!

02:22.472 --> 02:25.435
ASH: Yeah, right,
Professor Oak's lab...

02:29.399 --> 02:32.231
ASH: Mom, why didn't
you wake me up?!

02:32.232 --> 02:34.613
DELIA: You said yourself
when you turned ten,

02:34.614 --> 02:36.576
you could wake up on your own!

02:45.045 --> 02:47.417
BELLSPROUT/ODDISH: (EXCITED)

02:49.670 --> 02:51.751
ASH: Hey Professor Oak!
I made it. I'm here!

02:51.752 --> 02:53.003
PROFESSOR OAK: Oh. Hello, Ash.

02:53.253 --> 02:55.885
ASH: So, Professor Oak,
where's my Pokémon?!

02:55.886 --> 02:59.428
PROFESSOR OAK: Ah, so you're
the last of the four young ones

02:59.429 --> 03:01.101
starting out on
their journeys today.

03:02.723 --> 03:05.474
ASH: I've thought about it
a lot and it took me a

03:05.475 --> 03:07.516
really long time,
but I finally decided.

03:07.517 --> 03:09.148
I'm gonna choose Squirtle!

03:09.149 --> 03:11.360
PROFESSOR OAK: I'm afraid
Squirtle was chosen by

03:11.361 --> 03:12.441
a Trainer who wasn't late.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.483
SQUIRTLE: (EXCITED)

03:15.275 --> 03:18.698
ASH: I've got no one
to blame but myself.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.660
Okay, then I'll
choose Bulbasaur!

03:20.911 --> 03:22.161
PROFESSOR OAK: Bulbasaur
went with a Trainer

03:22.162 --> 03:24.283
who also got here on time.

03:24.284 --> 03:25.494
BULBASAUR: (HAPPY)

03:25.495 --> 03:30.290
ASH: All right! I mean
I really want Charmander!

03:30.540 --> 03:33.092
PROFESSOR OAK: Being a second
late for a train, or even a

03:33.093 --> 03:34.504
Pokémon, can be life changing.

03:35.425 --> 03:36.426
CHARMANDER: (AFFECTIONATE)

03:38.138 --> 03:43.433
ASH: Does that mean... I go on
my journey without a Pokémon?

03:44.304 --> 03:46.435
PROFESSOR OAK: Well,
there is another, but...

03:46.436 --> 03:47.808
ASH: Uh, I'll take it!

03:48.348 --> 03:50.479
PROFESSOR OAK: I think I should
warn you that there is a problem

03:50.480 --> 03:51.650
with this last one...

03:51.651 --> 03:53.152
ASH: So what?

03:53.153 --> 03:54.985
Since I was late, then I've
got a problem with me, too!

03:55.315 --> 03:56.656
PROFESSOR OAK: All right...

03:57.487 --> 04:06.706
ASH: Awesome! All right then,
you're my Pokémon! Whoa!

This Pokémon is called Pikachu.

04:22.682 --> 04:26.515
ASH: It's so cute! Looks
like I got the best one!

04:26.516 --> 04:27.887
PROFESSOR OAK: You'll see...

04:27.888 --> 04:30.229
ASH: Oh, yeah! Hi, Pikachu,
my name's Ash Ketchum!

04:30.230 --> 04:32.481
You and I are gonna
be best friends!

04:32.482 --> 04:33.602

PIKACHU: (ANNOYED) /
(THUNDERBOLT MOVE)

04:37.357 --> 04:40.159
PROFESSOR OAK: It's the
Electric Mouse Pokémon.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.032
Pikachu can be rather shy,
but quite electrifying

04:43.033 --> 04:44.324
when touched by humans.

04:44.905 --> 04:46.035
PIKACHU: (DISMISSIVE)

04:46.036 --> 04:48.498
ASH: Hey, I can
take a little zap!

04:49.169 --> 04:50.499
PROFESSOR OAK: All right then.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.503
If that's how you feel, then
this is Pikachu's Poké Ball.

04:54.084 --> 04:56.585
ASH: Thanks a lot, Professor!

04:56.586 --> 04:57.757
DELIA: Ash?

04:59.179 --> 05:00.549
DELIA: Remember, you were going
to head out on your journey

05:00.550 --> 05:03.553
right after getting your
Pokémon. For goodness sake!

05:10.060 --> 05:12.561
DELIA: Here. I packed shirts,
underwear, a towel,

05:12.562 --> 05:14.143
your toothbrush,
and a sleeping bag.

05:14.144 --> 05:16.106
ASH: Let's go, Pikachu!

05:16.646 --> 05:17.607
PIKACHU: (DISMISSIVE)

05:18.939 --> 05:20.990
DELIA: Don't Pokémon usually
go in their Poké Balls?

05:20.991 --> 05:24.444
ASH: They sure do!
Come on, Pikachu, get in!

05:24.825 --> 05:25.865
PIKACHU: (DISMISSIVE)

05:25.866 --> 05:29.209

PIKACHU: (EXERTION)

05:33.213 --> 05:34.663
PROFESSOR OAK: Oh, right.

05:34.664 --> 05:37.047
This Pikachu hates getting
into any sort of Poké Ball.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.800
ASH: Whoa, it does? Now get in!

05:51.932 --> 05:53.603
If you're playing catch, then
you're good friends already!

05:54.474 --> 05:57.437
ASH: Yeah, you're right! We're
best friends already, right?

05:58.608 --> 06:03.283
PIKACHU: (THUNDERBOLT MOVE)

06:11.291 --> 06:14.833

06:15.876 --> 06:16.877
PIKACHU: (STUBBORN)

I want to be your friend.

06:27.467 --> 06:29.638

gonna be my first step toward

06:47.657 --> 06:50.370
becoming a Pokémon Master!
Go, Poké Ball!

When you've caught a Pokémon

some of them will

It isn't Ash's fault!

27:02.371 --> 27:05.082
It was in the rain after
its Trainer abandoned it!

hundred and fifty years ago,

30:44.723 --> 30:47.094
there was a
magnificent Bell Tower.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.808
And this Bell Tower made it
possible for humans to actually

30:50.809 --> 30:52.390
make contact with Ho-Oh.

30:52.391 --> 30:55.022
SORREL: But lightning
struck the tower, engulfing

30:55.023 --> 30:59.026
it in flames. Suddenly, a great
rain came down, and the flames

30:59.027 --> 31:03.861
were extinguished. But three
nameless Pokémon succumbed to

31:03.862 --> 31:07.154
the inferno. Amidst the
destruction, Ho-Oh descended

31:07.155 --> 31:10.488

again, and they were revived.

31:10.489 --> 31:12.039
HO-OH: (CALLING)

31:20.669 --> 31:22.921

31:54.032 --> 31:57.034
SORREL: Few people have ever
even seen Ho-Oh, and on rare

31:57.035 --> 32:00.538
occasions, Ho-Oh is said to
bestow a feather on a human

32:00.539 --> 32:01.749

VERITY: But, why
would Ho-oh do that?

32:08.507 --> 32:11.178

explains it. It says there is a

Rainbow Wing to seek out Ho-Oh.

32:17.516 --> 32:18.857

45:05.913 --> 45:07.664
VERITY: Cheer up,
Charmeleon's fine!

45:07.665 --> 45:14.041
PIKACHU: (CALLING) / (EXERTION)
I (QUESTIONING) / (EXERTION)

45:16.794 --> 45:20.096
ASH: That guy...
His training is totally wrong!

45:20.097 --> 45:22.760
I know I should have
won that thing, but...

45:24.802 --> 45:27.844
SORREL: Try as you might, you
cannot deny his convictions.

45:27.845 --> 45:30.727
He and Incineroar are bonded
together through their shared

45:30.728 --> 45:32.850
belief in pure, raw strength.

45:34.021 --> 45:36.314
ASH: Even so, it's wrong
for a guy like that to win!

45:36.854 --> 45:39.737
SORREL: Your first step, needs
to be accepting that you lost.

45:39.947 --> 45:42.068
VERITY: Can't you channel
the frustration of losing,

45:42.069 --> 45:44.861
into working hard, so
that you'll win next time?

45:44.862 --> 45:46.914
ASH: Yeah, I hear you.

45:47.745 --> 45:54.501
You know? Pikachu
would've won that thing.

45:54.502 --> 45:55.542
PIKACHU: (SURPRISED)

45:55.543 --> 45:57.043
VERITY: Ash you
shouldn't say that!

45:57.044 --> 45:58.336
What if Charmeleon
had heard you?!

45:58.586 --> 45:59.637
PIKACHU: (QUESTIONING)

46:03.090 --> 46:04.841
SORREL: If winning's
all you care about...

46:04.842 --> 46:06.474
then you're no
different than Cross.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.307
PIKACHU: (WORRIED)

46:10.308 --> 46:11.308
VERITY: Ash, wait!

46:11.309 --> 46:13.941
SORREL: Hold on Ash come back!

46:23.200 --> 46:25.533
ASH: What's with those two
thinking they're so smart?

46:25.953 --> 46:27.164
PIKACHU: (WORRIED)

46:27.495 --> 46:29.536
ASH: Hey, I'm right,
don't you think?!

46:29.537 --> 46:30.617
PIKACHU: (NEGATIVE)

46:30.618 --> 46:32.248
ASH: So you're saying
it's my fault, huh?!

46:32.249 --> 46:33.291
PIKACHU: (AFFIRMATIVE)

46:36.674 --> 46:37.964
ASH: Even Pikachu...
Man...

46:37.965 --> 46:38.796

PIKACHU:
(EXERTION) / (QUESTIONING)

46:49.637 --> 46:52.058
ASH: If only my first
Pokémon had been a Squirtle

46:52.059 --> 46:53.269
or a Bulbasaur...

46:53.270 --> 46:55.483
PIKACHU:
(SHOCKED) / (ANGRY)

47:00.858 --> 47:01.899

47:33.641 --> 47:35.853
ASH: Pikachu...

47:44.982 --> 47:49.036
ASH: Ho-Oh, I thought
I was the Rainbow hero.

47:51.078 --> 47:56.954
Who needs Pikachu anyway?!
I'm just fine... all by myself!

47:57.495 --> 48:01.919
MARSHADOW: (CURIOUS)

48:21.979 --> 48:24.150
DELIA: Ash Ketchum,
are you still asleep?

48:24.151 --> 48:26.322
You'll be late getting to
Professor Oak's class!

48:26.323 --> 48:32.199
ASH: Yeah, right...
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

48:41.499 --> 48:43.540
ASH: Professor Oak!

48:43.541 --> 48:45.212
PROFESSOR OAK: Oh,
if it isn't Ash...

48:45.463 --> 48:47.093
ASH: Am I on time?

48:47.094 --> 48:48.965
PROFESSOR OAK: There are
four students who came

48:48.966 --> 48:50.968
to school late, and you
were the latest of them all.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.393
VERITY: Ash, you're late!

48:57.054 --> 48:58.555
ASH: I overslept a little.

48:58.556 --> 48:59.686
SORREL: Where's your homework?

48:59.687 --> 49:01.018
ASH: Aw, I forgot it!

49:01.398 --> 49:03.150
VERITY: What were you thinking?!

49:10.237 --> 49:11.407
VERITY: Ash, what is it?

49:11.408 --> 49:13.570
ASH: Uh... It's nothing.

49:13.571 --> 49:15.121
VERITY: You're weird.

49:15.122 --> 49:18.124
AGATHA: The subject of
today's class is rainbows.

49:18.125 --> 49:22.168
Rainbows are caused by the
sun's rays moving through the

49:22.169 --> 49:25.081
atmosphere, and when they
encounter water vapor,

49:25.082 --> 49:28.254
their light is bent and
refracted, causing a

49:28.255 --> 49:30.427
multicolored arc.
Children, have you ever...

49:40.898 --> 49:42.399
VERITY: How long are you
going to stand there?

49:43.561 --> 49:45.232
VERITY: Aren't you sick
of that view yet?

49:45.653 --> 49:47.104
SORREL: What's on your mind?

49:49.276 --> 49:51.779
ASH: I was just wondering
what's way out there.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.241
SORREL: Let's see.
There are forests and rivers,

49:55.242 --> 49:58.876
and mountains... And there's
the next town, too.

49:59.827 --> 50:01.117
ASH: And past that?

50:01.118 --> 50:02.669
SORREL: More
forests and rivers...

50:02.670 --> 50:04.582
and eventually,
you get to the sea.

50:05.292 --> 50:06.332
ASH: And past that?

50:06.333 --> 50:08.836
VERITY: I'm sure it's
more of the same.

50:09.547 --> 50:13.840
ASH: The thing is... you never
know until you go there.

50:13.841 --> 50:18.134
For me... I wanna see what's
out there with my own eyes.

50:18.135 --> 50:19.225
SORREL: On a journey?

50:19.226 --> 50:20.597
VERITY: Sounds like fun.

50:20.598 --> 50:23.139
You don't have to worry
about school and schedules.

50:23.140 --> 50:24.851
SORREL: You can see lots
of new things in places

50:24.852 --> 50:26.063
you never even knew about.

50:27.234 --> 50:30.146
ASH: And at night, I can look
at the stars and talk things

50:30.147 --> 50:32.278
over with friends
I'm traveling with...

50:32.279 --> 50:35.411
And as long as my buddy's
with me, I can go anywhere.

50:35.412 --> 50:36.412
SORREL: Your buddy?

50:36.413 --> 50:37.534
VERITY: What buddy?

50:37.535 --> 50:39.155
ASH: You even have to ask?

50:39.156 --> 50:43.750
My buddy's with me all the time!
Always...

50:43.751 --> 50:45.162
PIKACHU: (HAPPY)

50:51.218 --> 50:52.589
ASH: Oh, yeah...

50:52.590 --> 50:54.050
VERITY: Ash, you're crying.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.472
ASH: I am? So?

50:55.973 --> 50:57.223
VERITY: So pull
yourself together!

50:57.224 --> 50:58.345
SORREL: What's the matter?

51:09.236 --> 51:10.237
PIKACHU: (QUESTIONING)

51:17.324 --> 51:19.156
ASH: Hey, wait!

51:31.298 --> 51:34.551
ASH: Of course! We used to
run like this all the time!

51:38.015 --> 51:40.597
ASH: But... But...
I can't remember who you are!

51:40.598 --> 51:42.680
You were my very best friend,
but...

51:50.227 --> 51:51.859
ASH: Don't go!!

52:00.367 --> 52:01.498
PIKACHU: (HAPPY)

52:03.000 --> 52:04.370
PIKACHU: (CALLING)

It was all my fault!

52:29.897 --> 52:34.030
I'm sorry!
I just... I just...

52:34.031 --> 52:35.031
PIKACHU: (WORRIED)

52:35.032 --> 52:36.033
PIPLUP: (WORRIED)

52:41.909 --> 52:43.661

52:44.371 --> 52:46.372
ASH: Thank you very much.

52:46.373 --> 52:48.335

we've been looking for you?!

52:48.666 --> 52:49.707
PIPLUP: (SCOLDING)

52:50.377 --> 52:51.498
ASH: Uh... sorry.

52:51.919 --> 52:53.289
SORREL: Do you honestly
think you're going to win

52:53.290 --> 52:57.003
every battle? It's the times we
lose that we truly see what

52:57.004 --> 53:01.008
a Trainer's made of.
But that's just my opinion.

53:06.393 --> 53:09.807
ASH: Charmeleon... I'm sorry.

53:11.358 --> 53:13.771
VERITY: You forgot that
Pokémon even existed?!

53:14.692 --> 53:16.773

been the worst dream ever!

53:16.774 --> 53:17.864
PIPLUP: (WORRIED)

53:17.865 --> 53:19.525
SORREL: But, you know,
it's not impossible for

53:19.526 --> 53:20.988
Pokémon to leave us.

53:24.581 --> 53:26.452
SORREL: When I was young,
my parents were away for work

53:26.453 --> 53:30.416
more than home. My family had
a Luxray who took care of me.

53:30.417 --> 53:35.211
It was always with me.
But then.

53:35.212 --> 53:38.635
There was one awful day
when I went out alone...

YOUNG SORREL:
Luxray! Luxray! Luxray!

54:38.485 --> 54:41.527
SORREL: After that... I was
afraid to make friends with

54:41.528 --> 54:43.700
Pokémon for a very long time.

54:45.162 --> 54:47.533
SORREL: The only thing that
snapped me out of it...

54:47.534 --> 54:48.905
was when I met Lucario.

54:48.906 --> 54:49.957
