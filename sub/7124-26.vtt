00:29.180 --> 00:32.031
Aaaaaaaah!

00:34.182 --> 00:38.116
Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks!
We're comin'!

00:42.256 --> 00:45.035
There, there, Sweet P.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.966
It was just a dream.

00:49.003 --> 00:50.728
Just a dream.

00:50.805 --> 00:52.792
That's my brave little boy.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.409
Now you better
get dressed.

00:54.486 --> 00:57.017
Today's
your first day of school!

01:01.348 --> 01:03.476
Now eat up.

01:03.864 --> 01:04.986
Yum!

01:05.155 --> 01:09.206
That's fuel you're gonna need later
to soak up <i> all</i> the education.

01:09.375 --> 01:10.599
Yes, dad!

01:13.462 --> 01:16.238
Okay.
There's your lunch.

01:16.315 --> 01:19.159
And an apple for the teacher.

01:19.608 --> 01:21.018
- Aww...
- Aww...

01:28.702 --> 01:31.185
Golly,
it's awful nice of y'all

01:31.262 --> 01:35.026
to take Sweet P
to school on his first day.

01:35.151 --> 01:36.328
Our plezh, T.T.

01:36.405 --> 01:38.664
Yeah, first day of
school can be real tough.

01:38.741 --> 01:40.969
We wouldn't want
Sweet P freakin' out

01:41.046 --> 01:43.868
or awakening any latent
evil spirits within himself.

01:46.424 --> 01:48.415
Well,
we're gonna miss you, son.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.944
You think
still he's secretly evil,

01:54.021 --> 01:56.039
that he's
still all lichy in there?

01:56.313 --> 01:57.448
Mm, not sure.

01:57.525 --> 01:59.954
I don't know,
Finn. He just seems so...

02:00.218 --> 02:01.218
Sweet.

02:01.709 --> 02:02.709
Mm.

02:04.296 --> 02:07.254
- Bye!  - Bye!
- Bye!

02:13.715 --> 02:15.408
So far, so good.

02:19.256 --> 02:21.977
Fat squirrel in trub!
Aah!

02:22.622 --> 02:24.280
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Finn!

02:24.357 --> 02:26.433
Let's just see
how this plays out.

02:33.757 --> 02:36.377
- D'awww.
- Mm.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.125
All right.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.750
Welp, see ya later,
Sweet P.

02:44.827 --> 02:47.516
- Bye!
- Bye, Teddy-man.

02:49.741 --> 02:51.958
<i>Hey, baby man!</i>

02:52.054 --> 02:54.880
Did your grandma knit
your clothes?

02:55.106 --> 02:57.685
Yeah!
And she's my mom!

03:00.319 --> 03:02.099
Why you laughin',
baby man?

03:02.176 --> 03:04.688
- You're not even a real kid!
- Huh?

03:04.765 --> 03:07.989
You're nothin' but a big, weird baby man!

03:12.675 --> 03:13.948
Baby man!

03:21.627 --> 03:23.904
Let's see what we got here.

03:24.139 --> 03:27.595
Hello, there! Intimidated
by those bullies, eh?

03:27.672 --> 03:29.484
Uh... Yeah.

03:29.561 --> 03:31.148
What's your name, kid?

03:31.225 --> 03:32.420
Sweet P.

03:32.572 --> 03:35.077
I'm the one true king of OOO.

03:35.154 --> 03:37.469
This is my attorney, Toronto.

03:37.814 --> 03:41.284
Sweet P, there are all
kinds of education, you know.

03:41.361 --> 03:42.363
No.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.100
Yes, sir, all kinds,
such as... dancing.

03:46.177 --> 03:48.491
You could blow off
this podunk school

03:48.568 --> 03:50.797
and get a
proper dance education.

03:50.874 --> 03:54.345
Then you could come back and
really show those mean kids

03:54.422 --> 03:56.444
and make your parents proud!

03:56.521 --> 03:59.018
- Hey, king of OOO!
- Yes, Toronto?

03:59.095 --> 04:01.399
<i>You</i> are a certified
dance instructor, right?

04:01.476 --> 04:02.940
Show the kid
the dance you do.

04:03.017 --> 04:06.211
No, that dance is too tough for an amateur.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.659
Aw, come on. You got to
show the kid. It's awesome!

04:08.736 --> 04:10.979
Yeah, I know it's awesome,
but I really don't think

04:11.056 --> 04:12.795
- the kid is ready.
- Ready?

04:12.872 --> 04:15.624
I don't think he's
tough enough to be ready.

04:15.701 --> 04:17.632
I'm tough enough to be ready!

04:17.709 --> 04:19.325
See? The kid is tough...

04:19.402 --> 04:20.531
And ready.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.483
Please!

04:24.414 --> 04:26.729
Ah! I do see it!

04:26.806 --> 04:28.032
Eeeee!

04:28.240 --> 04:31.614
You've got a good eye,
and you are a good dog.

04:33.883 --> 04:35.706
Watch this, kid.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.894
Ah!

04:44.690 --> 04:46.020
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.097 --> 04:48.835
Why, we got us a prodigy here.

04:48.912 --> 04:51.621
You're ready for
advanced classes.

04:59.301 --> 05:02.216
Hey, you mugs! Want to see
some world-class dancing?

05:02.293 --> 05:03.672
Just turn around!

05:03.749 --> 05:07.061
- Ah, leave me alone!
- Leave me alone, too!

05:07.138 --> 05:08.904
I'm turning around.

05:32.863 --> 05:34.548
Ha! You did great!

05:34.625 --> 05:38.126
You should come back tomorrow,
kid... for more dancin' lessons!

05:38.411 --> 05:40.063
Have a gold star.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.997
Show that
to your parents, kid.

05:42.074 --> 05:44.840
They'll love it! But...

05:44.917 --> 05:47.174
don't tell 'em where you got it,

05:47.251 --> 05:49.090
or you'll ruin
the surprise.

05:49.167 --> 05:52.144
Just think of how proud
they'll be at your big, uh...

05:52.221 --> 05:54.253
end-of-the-year recital!

05:54.330 --> 05:55.437
You understand?

05:55.514 --> 05:57.556
Of course Sweet P understands!

05:57.633 --> 05:58.775
He's a good boy.

05:58.852 --> 06:00.642
A good boy!

06:03.269 --> 06:04.904
So, how was school?

06:04.981 --> 06:07.737
Yes, how'd you do?

06:08.874 --> 06:11.253
A gold star!

06:11.330 --> 06:14.903
I'm gonna put this where
we can see it every day.

06:17.808 --> 06:20.089
- Thumbs up.
- Thumbs up.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.240
- Come on! Thumbs up!
- Come on! Thumbs up!

06:22.317 --> 06:23.468
Thumbs up.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.940
- Thumbs up.
- Thumbs up.

06:54.724 --> 06:58.196
Well, this is our place.
We'd invite you in, but...

06:58.273 --> 07:00.301
- The place is a mess.
- He's right.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.034
We're filthy. Listen, we all need a break.

07:03.111 --> 07:05.691
Go on home, kid, and
we'll see you tomorrow.

07:05.768 --> 07:06.861
Mm.

07:10.699 --> 07:14.530
Sweet P,
we're going on a date.

07:14.607 --> 07:17.294
You're smart and
educated enough

07:17.371 --> 07:20.048
to stay at home
all by yourself.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.321
The proof is on the fridge.

07:24.985 --> 07:28.893
Mama and papa will be so
surprised if the refrigerator

07:28.970 --> 07:31.717
is all covered with
stars when they get back.

07:31.794 --> 07:34.017
One more star should do it.

07:34.094 --> 07:37.420
I need to find king of OOO and Toronto

07:37.497 --> 07:40.014
to get me that last star.

07:42.591 --> 07:44.861
I don't know, K.O. They've gone rancid.

07:44.938 --> 07:45.983
Horse feathers.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.386
A lick of gold paint
is all it needs.

07:48.463 --> 07:51.603
Just a couple more
garbage stars, eh, Toronto?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.883
Mo' stars means
mo' dosh.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.834
Soon we'll have
enough scratch

07:55.911 --> 07:57.948
to fund my big comeback.

07:58.025 --> 08:01.442
This kid is great at
helping us rob people!

08:01.519 --> 08:04.440
And best of all, he doesn't know a thing.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.849
Because if he did...

08:05.926 --> 08:09.242
- We'd have to take care of him!
- We'd have to take care of him!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.196
What was that?

08:13.640 --> 08:14.775
Sweet P?

08:15.044 --> 08:17.286
- What did you hear?
- What does it matter?

08:17.363 --> 08:19.962
- None of it was good.
- We got to take care of him.

08:20.039 --> 08:21.631
Aaaaah!

08:21.763 --> 08:23.572
I shouldn't have said
that out loud.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.314
Mom! Dad!

08:31.165 --> 08:32.798
Hey, kid!

08:33.193 --> 08:34.863
Toronto and I talked it
over,

08:34.940 --> 08:36.390
and we decided we're not

08:36.467 --> 08:38.241
going to "take care" of you.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.554
We're gonna burn down your orchard.

08:40.826 --> 08:42.942
- Noooooo!
- Yep.

08:43.019 --> 08:46.178
We're gonna burn it down.
Unless...

08:46.255 --> 08:47.232
Unless?

08:47.309 --> 08:49.594
You leave home and
your loving parents

08:49.671 --> 08:52.271
and come dance
with us forever.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.439
- Forever.
- Nooo!

08:54.516 --> 08:56.020
No, no, no, no, no!

08:56.097 --> 08:59.368
Come on, Sweet P!
The people love you!

08:59.507 --> 09:00.687
They do?

09:00.764 --> 09:03.232
Well, mostly they love to laugh
at you.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.141
I mean look at yourself.
You're a...

09:05.218 --> 09:07.474
a... a big weird baby man!

09:08.974 --> 09:12.338
Baby man, baby man...
baby man, baby man,

09:12.415 --> 09:15.965
baby man, baby man, baby man!

09:18.225 --> 09:20.155
- Stop.
- Stop.

09:20.658 --> 09:23.696
- I have learned much from you.
- I have learned much from you.

09:23.773 --> 09:26.319
Thank you, my teachers.

09:26.411 --> 09:29.962
And now for your... education.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.221
Before there was time...

09:33.463 --> 09:35.904
Before there was anything...

09:37.428 --> 09:38.653
There was nothing.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.811
And before there was nothing...

09:41.775 --> 09:44.609
There were monsters.

09:48.828 --> 09:51.695
Here's your gold star.

10:00.412 --> 10:01.850
Mr. King of OOO?

10:01.927 --> 10:03.897
Uh-ba-ba-ba-ba. Huh?

10:04.899 --> 10:06.499
Monster!

10:06.592 --> 10:08.403
Aaaaaaah!

10:11.884 --> 10:14.059
Just a dream.

10:17.339 --> 10:20.154
- Mornin', son.
- Good morning, Sweet P.

10:21.368 --> 10:23.109
Surprise!

10:23.201 --> 10:26.875
Oh! My, my, where did
you get all this bling?

10:26.952 --> 10:28.904
Uh... My teachers.

10:28.981 --> 10:32.668
Wow! How nice of those teachers.

10:32.745 --> 10:34.068
Mm-hmm!

10:36.758 --> 10:39.815
Hey, baby man. Guess who we are.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.167
Huh?
