I was prepared for.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.943
In what way? Wanting to be home?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.640
Even now I feel the pull.

22:17.684 --> 22:18.902
Lying here like this with you

22:18.946 --> 22:20.469
in this perfect moment.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.384
I still feel it.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.907
Every time I leave him
I'’m thinking

22:23.951 --> 22:25.735
am I doing the right thing?

22:25.779 --> 22:27.302
What does that mean though,
the right thing?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.522
Some point you have
to let him be.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.915
I know, I'’m sure the feeling
will fade as he gets older.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.874
I just...

22:33.917 --> 22:35.963
I'’ve only spent a few nights
away from him.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.661
-Seems mad.
-So what?

22:38.705 --> 22:40.707
To miss him and to want
to be alone at the same time.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.926
It'’s like I'm constantly
being pulled

22:42.970 --> 22:44.319
in opposite directions.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.974
-Right.
-I want to have my own life.

22:47.017 --> 22:50.151
To have adult interactions
but how can I forgive myself

22:50.194 --> 22:52.893
if something happened to him
if I wasn'’t there?

22:52.936 --> 22:56.418
Right, of course, but aren'’t
you just tempting fate?

22:56.462 --> 22:59.160
Well, every parent tries.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.161
At some point
you'’ll have to let him be,

23:00.204 --> 23:03.120
you'’ll cripple him.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.513
I just want him to be safe.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.080
And he is and he will be.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.951
You can'’t control randomness.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.997
I know.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.173
You think you'’ll let him fail?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.131
-At life?
-At anything.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.960
Kids seem to have no onus
put on them anymore.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.310
Failures are all the parents.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.138
Did your parents let you fail?

23:21.182 --> 23:22.836
I was perhaps given
a little too much latitude

23:22.879 --> 23:24.315
in that department.

23:24.359 --> 23:28.319
Retaking calculus
more than a few times.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.496
And you'’re proud of this?

23:30.539 --> 23:32.802
No, but I accepted
my failure eventually.

23:32.846 --> 23:37.328
It'’s my fault. Not the parents,
not the teachers, but mine.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.505
Well, in 15 to 20 years
I won'’t be helping him

23:39.548 --> 23:43.944
with his calculus homework,
as if I could.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.642
Just saying that there'’s
a constructiveness to failure

23:46.686 --> 23:48.905
that seems to have been lost.

23:48.949 --> 23:51.604
Some parents make me
not want to have kids.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.519
Are you talking
about someone specific?

23:53.562 --> 23:55.825
-Of course.
-Who?

23:55.869 --> 23:58.132
No one,
are you done having kids?

23:58.175 --> 24:02.136
I don'’t know, I'd always
imagined I'’d have more.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.094
You do come from a big family.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.792
You know, I'’d like to say
we'’re done but sometimes

24:05.835 --> 24:08.490
a mothering instinct
comes on so strong

24:08.534 --> 24:10.884
and I can'’t help but want more.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.495
I can'’t imagine
wanting to be outnumbered.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.758
It'’s just so hard
to pause your life.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.499
I guess it'’s really two years.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.936
Yeah, you start with things
the same for the most part

24:19.980 --> 24:23.070
but normal life becomes
harder and harder to maintain

24:23.113 --> 24:26.595
and then you just
sort of disappear.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.554
You still saw people.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.772
People came to see me, yes.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.253
But...

24:32.296 --> 24:35.125
the world, your job,
nothing waits for you.

24:35.169 --> 24:38.738
Except me.

24:38.781 --> 24:42.959
You'’re abnormal, kiddo.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.744
So weird though because
this thing'’s happening to you

24:44.787 --> 24:46.528
but nobody really even knows.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.922
-Most people don'’t know you.
-Everyone that knows me knew

24:48.965 --> 24:51.359
but other people that
I thought would know didn'’t.

24:51.402 --> 24:54.014
Someone from Pete'’s work
came over after I had Will

24:54.057 --> 24:55.711
and told me they didn'’t even
know I was pregnant

24:55.755 --> 24:58.584
until Pete took two weeks
off for the birth.

24:58.627 --> 25:01.021
He doesn'’t want to tell people
that he works with

25:01.064 --> 25:04.981
about his personal life,
that bothers you?

25:05.025 --> 25:08.768
They are close enough friends
to come to my house.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.683
It just really makes you feel
like it'’s happening to you

25:10.726 --> 25:16.036
-and not happening to us.
-It is happening to you though.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.777
The experience of parenting
is just different

25:17.820 --> 25:19.039
for a man and a woman.

25:19.082 --> 25:20.606
Man'’s life's allowed to continue

25:20.649 --> 25:22.521
essentially unchanged.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.653
Women are different afterwards.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.526
It'’s no wonder so many people
divorce after having kids.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.266
I used to think it was
because they couldn'’t handle

25:29.310 --> 25:31.704
the change in their lives,
I now know it'’s because

25:31.747 --> 25:33.053
they can'’t handle the change

25:33.096 --> 25:35.534
or lack of change
in their partner.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.492
Could be that neither do
and they were never meant

25:37.536 --> 25:39.059
-to make it work.
-I know I'’m generalizing

25:39.102 --> 25:40.626
but I'’m just saying as a woman
there'’s so many

25:40.669 --> 25:43.629
"What have I done"
moments when you have a kid.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.065
You don'’t think men do?

25:45.108 --> 25:47.197
They start a lot earlier
for women.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.156
You live moment to moment
with them for nine months.

25:49.199 --> 25:52.289
I'’m sure it's not hard
for the guy to feel left out.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.900
They'’re there as much
as they want to be.

25:53.943 --> 25:56.772
I wouldn'’t know.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.001
[phone buzzing]

26:28.499 --> 26:31.764
Chelsea? I was thinking
we could do something

26:31.807 --> 26:34.941
we used to when
we were unemployed.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.464
What might that be?

26:36.507 --> 26:38.727
I think we should
get a little high.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.337
Really?

26:40.381 --> 26:41.817
Oh God.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.210
I haven'’t done that in years.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.255
I rarely ever do either
except at Thanksgiving

26:45.299 --> 26:48.389
-with my cousins.
-Why Thanksgiving?

26:48.432 --> 26:50.913
It doesn'’t matter,
that'’s just who I got it from.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.699
Should we?

26:53.742 --> 26:56.658
Let'’s go out to the alley
so it feels authentic.

26:56.702 --> 27:00.401
[birds chirping]

27:42.051 --> 27:44.750
-I miss your old car.
-You and you alone.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.795
A lot of people had
a lot of fun in that car.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.667
-Died with my youth.
-I'’ll probably picture you

27:48.710 --> 27:50.320
driving it forever.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.887
You'’ll be 50
and coming to pick me up

27:51.931 --> 27:56.544
and I'’ll still picture
that gray Grand Am.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.807
It'’s weird, those impressions
you get in your mind

27:58.851 --> 28:00.374
that you can'’t get rid of.

28:00.417 --> 28:04.421
I'’m sure they changed overtime,
they distort.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.947
I guess.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.210
You think so?

28:10.253 --> 28:12.865
Memories become less sharp,
for sure.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.650
They get filled in
by fiction, sorry.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.217
That summer we spent
so much time together

28:17.260 --> 28:19.088
I remember a red polka dot dress

28:19.132 --> 28:21.308
but I'’m sure there wasn't one.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.136
I don'’t remember a red dress.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.312
Doesn'’t mean
I haven'’t forgotten.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.488
You'’ve always had a mind
for minutia.

28:27.531 --> 28:32.536
Seasons for me
are one blurred jumble.

28:42.068 --> 28:46.246
How is it that you never tried
anything with me back then?

28:46.289 --> 28:48.161
What if you'’d rejected me?

28:48.204 --> 28:51.991
An unrequited flirtation is
sometimes better than reality.

28:52.034 --> 28:55.429
Blow it hard.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.300
You'’re disappointed.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.954
No, definitely not,
I couldn'’t be happier.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.522
But how many years
in the making is this?

29:01.565 --> 29:03.219
Eight, nine?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.276
I really do wish
I remembered the first time

29:16.319 --> 29:18.191
I knew who you were.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.584
Why did you never
try anything with me?

29:20.628 --> 29:21.890
I just thought
I was one of many.

29:21.934 --> 29:25.502
Some old lady you kept around.

29:25.546 --> 29:28.505
I'’m sure you know
that isn'’t true and never was.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.464
There were a lot back then.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.814
There weren'’t really.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.643
During our summer
I had a girlfriend.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.166
Yeah.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.647
There was also some ginger girl,
what was her name?

29:39.690 --> 29:42.998
-Mel.
-Right. Mel.

29:43.042 --> 29:46.175
Did you ever have any
isolated incidents with Mel?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.438
No, never, close once.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.006
She'’s married now.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.139
And this would stop you?

29:58.753 --> 30:00.886
Gotta empty that for me.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.280
I'’ve retired
that part of my life.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.195
If you'’re sure.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.067
I rarely have the mental energy
for fantasy anymore.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.809
There are only like three women
I fantasize about now.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.288
Come on.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.508
Seriously, you, Mel
and this girl

30:14.551 --> 30:16.466
I worked with years ago.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.294
No one else?

30:18.338 --> 30:20.340
There are moments but persistent
fantasy over the years

30:20.383 --> 30:22.211
there are three.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.647
'’Cause what, you've never slept
with any of them

30:23.691 --> 30:25.301
before this weekend?

30:25.345 --> 30:26.868
Women I became
attached to emotionally

30:26.912 --> 30:29.044
but never physically.

30:29.088 --> 30:32.221
For whatever reason
they'’ve persisted.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.136
You actually
had feelings for them.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.660
You and them.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.401
There are beautiful athletes,
celebrities

30:38.445 --> 30:40.490
but they'’re empty to me.

30:47.758 --> 30:48.585
Who was that...

30:48.629 --> 30:51.501
[coughing]

30:51.545 --> 30:52.894
...actress you liked?

30:52.938 --> 30:55.636
That one when we used
to do our celebrity crushes.

30:55.679 --> 30:58.334
-You know who I mean.
-Shelley Duvall.

30:58.378 --> 31:01.163
Right from The Shining.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.338
Yes.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.515
She'’s beautiful.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.560
She was.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.605
She was.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.130
She was.

31:22.184 --> 31:26.493
No, don'’t, don't, don'’t.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.237
[buzzing]

31:33.195 --> 31:34.718
No.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.198
Hello?

31:37.939 --> 31:39.462
Good day, sir.

31:39.506 --> 31:42.161
[buzzing]

31:42.204 --> 31:44.946
Do it, do it.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.048
[buzzing]

32:00.092 --> 32:02.137
I feel like all this
stuff'’s in here for a reason.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.053
The door was unlocked
when I got here.

32:05.097 --> 32:09.318
I think we'’re supposed to know
we aren'’t welcome.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.277
The door was unlocked.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.280
The doors were closed.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.324
It'’s no different
than going through

32:15.368 --> 32:17.848
someone'’s medicine cabinet.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.807
-I don'’t do that.
-If anything, that'’s different.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.244
-I don'’t do that.
-It'’s more personal.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.898
Never?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.466
Aren'’t you curious?

32:26.509 --> 32:30.557
I don'’t think I know anybody
with a medicine cabinet.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.038
You know what I mean.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.737
Well, I wouldn'’t like
the idea of someone

32:36.780 --> 32:39.566
raiding through my life.

32:39.609 --> 32:43.222
Is that why your
Instagram is private?

32:43.265 --> 32:47.052
I don'’t want people to
look at pictures of my kid.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.141
People I don'’t know.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.926
There are that many people going
through your social media?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.320
You don'’t know who's looking.

32:54.363 --> 32:59.803
I'’ll let you in on something:
there'’s no one.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.849
You don'’t understand.

33:04.504 --> 33:08.203
I read somewhere recently

33:08.247 --> 33:09.683
that childhood kidnappings
are down

33:09.726 --> 33:13.948
something like 60 percent
since the 1980s.

33:13.992 --> 33:18.387
Are there many child kidnappings
in Aurora?

33:18.431 --> 33:20.563
It'’s not funny.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.739
Dateline'’s not supposed
to be funny.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.959
There'’s too much Dateline
in our lives.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.614
No, this,
I'’m not joking about it.

33:29.746 --> 33:32.619
Is the weed just making me
more edgy than normal?

33:32.662 --> 33:34.186
Me too.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.666
Come look through
these people'’s stuff with me.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.581
Their lives anyways.

33:40.844 --> 33:43.673
Is there really a difference?

33:43.717 --> 33:48.765
-Between what?
-Your stuff and your life.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.725
I don'’t know,
I'’d like to think so.

33:51.768 --> 33:54.206
But I mean,
why do we need so much stuff?

33:54.249 --> 33:56.991
I'’m sure these people
don'’t need all of this.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.775
You moved to the suburbs

34:24.845 --> 34:27.152
My interests, my job.

by books or movies define you?

like your coat?

Yeah, but I mean like,
everything is a thing

from the things up there.

choose those things

-What defines you?

35:11.152 --> 35:14.503
My family, Will.

35:14.547 --> 35:17.593
So you'’re defined
by other people?

35:17.637 --> 35:21.249
I never really thought
of Will as people.

35:21.293 --> 35:25.210
He is at least, technically.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.908
Yeah, but I'’ve always been
defined by my relationships.

35:27.951 --> 35:29.910
I don'’t mind, you know?

Ever since I was younger.

-Friends choose you too,

says something.

-They do

35:52.150 --> 35:55.805
and we'’re in the middle
of their lives right now.

35:55.849 --> 35:59.200
Do you think we'’ll get
in trouble for being in here?

35:59.244 --> 36:01.376
All they can do is give me
a bad rating and frankly,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.944
I'’m sick of the rating-based
society we live in.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.946
Me too.

36:05.989 --> 36:06.990
Why can'’t someone just tell me

36:07.034 --> 36:08.905

36:08.949 --> 36:10.777
Everything'’s the best
or the worst anyway.

-Probably saving for something

their home.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.622
You dream of anything
and everything

39:23.665 --> 39:26.668
but a dream is different.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.149
A dream is different
than a dream.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.412
It'’s surreal.

A beach, an island

It is reality though.

Yes.

No, but when I wake at night
the fear is there.

never talk to me again.

-It'’s only you.

and you'’d be here

that you wanna do this again,

56:13.457 --> 56:16.155
-just with someone else.
-What do you want me to say?

That I wanna fuck other women?

You are other women.

of my entire adult life.

doesn'’t mean that's gonna stop.

get what you want,

and we'’d be here.

to anyone.

about us realizing

-what we'’ve always known.
-And now you'’ve realized it.

you'’re here isn't me?

my current situation.

in your life got you here,

and I'’m sorry for that.

I could say
the same thing to you.

in the crowd to you.

-Isn'’t it?

you never left my mind.

gonna tell my husband?

what you already told him.

how can I go home and kiss him?

-Feeling will fade.

But it won'’t, what if it just
grows and festers inside me?

58:09.660 --> 58:12.576
-You won'’t say anything.
-I don'’t know how I won't.

58:12.619 --> 58:15.274
What if I can'’t
be with him anymore?

58:15.317 --> 58:17.755
-What are you gonna tell him?
-What we did.

58:19.670 --> 58:22.803
I won'’t be responsible
for breaking up a marriage.

-I think you need to calm down.

this would destroy Pete?

I don'’t understand
why this TV is so small.

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:24.247
What do you mean?

1:09:24.290 --> 1:09:26.292
Why would someone
own a TV this small?

1:09:26.336 --> 1:09:27.380
Maybe it'’s old.

I haven'’t slept with her yet,
she'’s quite a bit younger.

1:09:42.134 --> 1:09:45.137
It'’s funny how men
equate cheating with sex.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:48.096
It'’s part of it, sure,
but it'’s the intimacy.

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:50.186
If your only defense is that
you haven'’t slept with her,

1:09:50.229 --> 1:09:51.883
it'’s probably too late.

You have a perverse view

I find it hard to believe
you view sex like that.

It'’s better if you don't
share it with everyone you know.

1:11:14.095 --> 1:11:15.401
-Really?
-It'’s better

Sounds to me like you actually
have feelings for these women,

Well, you just had a baby,

-Because of my wedding?
-Yes and no.

1:14:59.582 --> 1:15:01.409
I'’m sure I acted strangely
around the time of your wedding,

I mean, I acted strangely
at your wedding.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.198
You were fine,
you just didn'’t talk much.

Afterwards, out of pity,
she kept in close contact

had to tell her to stop,

It cut me so deeply.

1:15:50.807 --> 1:15:54.419

that somehow it'’d pass,

back together again,

I'’ve never felt
something like that before,

1:16:08.128 --> 1:16:11.044

of emotion afterwards.

I was in then?

-in that apartment.
-You did.

never talk to me again.

and she'’d be there.

for what I thought

1:18:19.999 --> 1:18:22.480
was the last time.

1:18:22.523 --> 1:18:24.743
I remember going to
a garage sale and buying a copy

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:28.747
of This Side of Paradise,
which somehow made sense.

1:18:28.791 --> 1:18:30.662
And I bought
some good stationery,

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:34.535
and I wrote this suicide note
that I thought was wonderful

1:18:34.579 --> 1:18:36.712
aligning all the reasons
why I wasn'’t worth it.

1:18:38.322 --> 1:18:40.759
Then, I showered,

No, I realized I--

I was afraid of death,
and what it meant

1:19:09.092 --> 1:19:11.181
being dead.

1:19:11.224 --> 1:19:14.184
But not really, just quite
suddenly I found myself

1:19:14.227 --> 1:19:16.795

there was a hell.

for reasons to not do it.
