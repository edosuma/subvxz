WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:09.860
yeah

00:09.859 --> 00:12.789
yeah

00:12.789 --> 00:14.149
hi

00:14.150 --> 00:20.118
I'm sorry about what happened the other
night at dinner I didn't mean for things

00:20.118 --> 00:21.140
to go like that

00:21.140 --> 00:25.460
how did you expect it to go you tell me
you want to take over my team's you

00:25.460 --> 00:27.259
think I wouldn't be upset

00:27.259 --> 00:32.028
I said it wrong all I meant was that I
wanted to work more closely be more

00:32.029 --> 00:32.960
efficient

00:32.960 --> 00:36.230
it didn't sound like that that's because
you got so defensive

00:37.039 --> 00:42.890
I'm sorry okay i'm glad the subject is
closed

00:42.890 --> 00:48.948
hey um I was wondering if I could have
copies of your personnel files you know

00:48.948 --> 00:51.948
resumes histories of your employees

00:52.579 --> 00:56.509
what for just so I can get a better
understanding of the people I work with

00:57.018 --> 01:01.908
i'll give you the same information no
you don't need it

01:01.908 --> 01:05.420
e you're right i don't need it but
unless it violates national security I'd

01:05.420 --> 01:06.350
like to have it

01:06.349 --> 01:10.250
you are still trying to take control my
team Archer look this isn't personal

01:11.060 --> 01:16.609
ok we are just trying to examine how to
handle things more efficiently make

01:16.609 --> 01:18.890
things work better that is all

01:18.890 --> 01:22.670
nobody's made any decisions and you know
something I think you're thinking a

01:22.670 --> 01:24.230
little bit too much about this

01:24.230 --> 01:29.510
nobody's trying to take your job Shawn
oh one more thing i would also like a

01:29.510 --> 01:31.520
complete inventory of your equipment

01:31.519 --> 01:36.469
I'm talking boats jet skis trucks and
these innocuous request should concern

01:36.469 --> 01:37.129
me

01:37.129 --> 01:40.969
you are so defensive what is the problem
of letting me see what's on this

01:40.969 --> 01:43.789
property and the people that I'm working
with i told you i will give you the same

01:43.790 --> 01:44.720
information

01:44.719 --> 01:50.239
I think about it ok so when you do that
but it seems like a very simple request

01:50.239 --> 01:55.549
I mean we are working together we share
a space but you don't work for me and I

01:55.549 --> 02:00.750
definitely don't work for you and no one
ever said you did

02:00.750 --> 02:05.459
oh and one more thing while you're
getting together those personnel and

02:05.459 --> 02:08.908
inventory files you can just whip up a
little budget for me if you have some

02:08.908 --> 02:09.960
time that would be great

02:09.960 --> 02:14.040
I'm sure I can't do that I understand
that's cool i will just get it from

02:14.039 --> 02:17.039
someone else

02:22.500 --> 02:29.789
what's going on jenna is trying to take
over the lifeguard training center

02:29.789 --> 02:34.769
the team me the equipment everything
would make say about it

02:34.770 --> 02:41.250
I don't know I haven't talked to him yet
why not it's not his problem Don

02:41.250 --> 02:44.459
I told you before the jenna is a smart
political animal

02:44.459 --> 02:48.300
she knows this game if she told you
she's thinking about making a move

02:48.300 --> 02:51.270
let me tell you something she probably
has already done it you just don't know

02:51.270 --> 02:52.140
about it yet

02:52.139 --> 02:55.169
she's right i am afraid of losing
control

02:55.860 --> 03:00.690
I think that I can take this team and
make it into something then you're right

03:00.689 --> 03:04.139
you need to win this fight on your own
if you call mention he gets involved in

03:04.139 --> 03:07.409
your left out on the side but if you
wait much longer she's gonna set her

03:07.409 --> 03:11.519
roots so deep if you take her on and
lose I lose there will be no more

03:11.519 --> 03:12.629

for what to save lives to save lives

15:14.629 --> 15:22.519
Sean you play at lifeguarding you have
all this equipment you have the money

you have the uniforms and what do you do
with it

15:25.220 --> 15:28.910
you run training exercises I had that
environment

15:29.419 --> 15:33.309
I would save lives let you destroy this
Janet

15:33.309 --> 15:38.409
the decision has already been made Sean
accepted and let the professionals take

15:38.409 --> 15:41.409
over professionals and what do you think
we are

15:41.950 --> 15:46.120
dilettante militants you are out of your
mind

15:46.120 --> 15:50.889
you know what your problem is i think
you have forgotten the reason why you

15:50.889 --> 15:52.539
became a lifeguard in the first place

15:52.539 --> 15:55.539
my son is why I do it

16:06.960 --> 16:10.650
he's two years old and he drowned

16:13.278 --> 16:18.470
and I wasn't there is the grease that

16:19.208 --> 16:22.328
the pain that it caused me almost killed
me it killed my marriage

16:22.328 --> 16:28.868
it turned my wife is somebody I didn't
even know i will never ever be the same

16:28.869 --> 16:31.869
forgot

16:32.440 --> 16:35.650
no i'm not sure i haven't forgot

16:35.649 --> 16:38.649
I can never forget

16:40.379 --> 16:45.090
sorry every time I save someone's life

16:45.690 --> 16:48.510
I know the grease and i'm saving their
family and if i can make other

16:48.509 --> 16:51.870
lifeguards better they can make me
better we can save even more lives and

16:51.870 --> 16:54.990
that's why this training center has to
continue

16:54.990 --> 16:58.350
I had no idea of you didn't care

16:58.350 --> 17:03.750
your snap judgments and see evaluations
risk you want what you want you coming

doing and they were wrong they are a
team and it's your teen

33:17.388 --> 33:24.528
it's okay Jenna you know from your point
of view I could kind of see how you'd

33:24.528 --> 33:30.798
see is a bunch of Della tons-- / finance
self-important and the kind of arrogance

33:30.798 --> 33:33.798
that goes along from having both of
those things

33:35.719 --> 33:40.999
the international training center just
enough to make you feel a little self

33:40.999 --> 33:41.808
important

33:41.808 --> 33:45.798
yeah well you see the problem is that i
don't know if we can change things

33:45.798 --> 33:48.888
because the decisions have already been
made

33:48.888 --> 33:53.269
