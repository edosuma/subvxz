M_I_SForEver

02:14.342 --> 02:15.802
Ahoy!
Alright, Bob?

02:19.056 --> 02:20.432
Hey!

02:20.515 --> 02:21.683
Quick piss and a stretch,
alright?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.352
We're already late.
Bob.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.770
Dave! Thanks for doing this, bud.
Good to see you, bud.

02:24.852 --> 02:25.728
And you, mate.

02:25.811 --> 02:27.272
- It's Viktor.
- Ah, Viktor.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.024
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.401
This is Jim.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.740
So this the A Team,
eh, Bob?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.034
Your nephew
who's never worked,

02:39.785 --> 02:41.912
a Cossack and a fucking
pensioner, huh?

02:42.746 --> 02:44.289
Cossack?

02:45.457 --> 02:47.292
Calm down.
I'm just kidding, alright?

02:48.043 --> 02:50.462
That's your joke?
I'm Russian to you?

02:50.545 --> 02:51.588
I'm Ukrainian.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.173
You're all the same to me.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.551
{\an8}Okay, thank you, ladies.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.886
Right, if you want three months
work, jump in the van.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.054
If you don't then stay here
and have a chat.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.222
Alright?
In we go.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.890
Off we fuck then, boys.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.018
Siding with the immigrant, eh?

03:05.102 --> 03:08.689
You're all fucking immigrants
around here, bud.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.899
Oi!
Stop pissing on the flowers!

03:20.575 --> 03:22.577
<i>Who said,
If you live amongst wolves,</i>

03:22.661 --> 03:25.205
<i>you must act like a wolf.</i>

03:25.288 --> 03:27.374
<i>Was it A) Ernest Hemingway...</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:29.167
Haven't seen like a building
or nothing in like,

03:29.251 --> 03:30.502
twenty minutes.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.130
It's like being in bloody
Africa or something.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.757
Yeah, we got all sorts
going on down here now.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.094
Electricity, poppety pings.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.264
Go down, Cardiff Bay
after a skinfull.

03:42.347 --> 03:46.059
Squint.
Could be Sydney, bud. Huh?

03:46.143 --> 03:48.186
<i>Smell that fresh air,
Stevie boy!</i>

04:06.204 --> 04:09.166
Once your inheritance clears,
everything's golden, Simon.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.334
But I'm afraid until then
your financial situation

04:11.418 --> 04:13.962
is rather more Milton Keynes
than Monaco.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.759
Building work's a money pit.
It's notorious for it.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.386
Not on the terms
I've got this guy.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.184
You'll inherit this fucking
pile of rocks by Christmas.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.770
Just sit tight
and enjoy the views.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.773
It's exactly what my family
would expect of me.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.110
<i>Simon!
Have you seen my keys?</i>

04:37.402 --> 04:39.446
No, darling.
Have you tried the kitchen?

04:39.529 --> 04:42.407
Ouch! Fuck!

04:42.491 --> 04:43.617
Sorry about that.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.455
Look, you employ me
to give you advice.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.457
If you're not going to listen,
then I might as well go.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.211
But you need to know,
there's been rumors...

04:54.294 --> 04:56.213
I mean, the city
runs on them but um,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.173
about further clamp downs.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.300
The inheritance trust,
the Caymans,

05:00.384 --> 05:01.718
but every penny is in there.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.220
You said that was legitimate.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.014
Now did you avoid that
or evade it?

05:06.098 --> 05:07.224
Look, one's a criminal offense,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.976
the other earns a gold star
in ingenuity.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.397
Inheritance tax
isn't meant to be optional.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.148
Just once I wish
you'd bring me good news.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.404
Oh!

05:21.113 --> 05:23.990
There's an alarming amount
of testosterone in here.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.952
Erm, I thought we were off
to the wild's.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.995
Sorry, the builders are late.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.456
Great.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.583
Darling, I've just been told
this whole renovation thing's

05:33.667 --> 05:35.335
a bad idea.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.962
What do you think?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.218
Well, um, what's he called?
Is it Robert?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.344
- Richard.
- Richard.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.595
Richard.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.349
Personally, I...
I think it's fine how it is,

05:49.433 --> 05:53.603
but I think you'll find if this
one has an idea in his head,

05:53.687 --> 05:56.356
he, er, he's very hard
to dissuade.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.941
It was just advice.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.484
Right.
I'll be heading off.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.361
Simon, don't worry about that
thing we were talking about.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.489
I'll keep my ears to the ground
and make contingency.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.953
I suppose I'd better
unpack then?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.164
Okay.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.474
Oh my God, man.
What a shit hole!

06:30.557 --> 06:32.267
You never been to Rhyll,
then?

06:35.145 --> 06:40.067
Well, it's only for a couple
of weeks, lads.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.695
Once we've got the barn fitted
up, we'll camp in there, yeah?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.656
Breathe it in, lads, that's as
sweet as she's gonna smell.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.533
The five of is in here, eh?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.160
Fucking hell.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.204
This is fucking luxury.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.622
I've got shit
in some plastic box

06:53.705 --> 06:56.124
like some student
at Glastonbury.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.170
It stinks in here, Bob.
It smells like someone died.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.338
Yeah, well do us a favor,

07:01.421 --> 07:02.839
shift your stuff,
you're on the top.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.799
Shut it.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.614
Okay, so!

07:27.698 --> 07:29.616
Hay barn to be renovated.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.660
Restoration to that barn there.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.704
And the outbuilding conversion.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.998
Now, let's just get the
parameters crystal clear.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.375
Shall we?

07:38.458 --> 07:41.920
Three months, or completion
penalties will kick in.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.423
Let's just bring her in on time
and on budget, yes?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.049
Absolutely lads, yeah?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.970
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.723
- Ooh!
- Are you alright?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.266
No worries.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.230
Er, hiya, gents!

08:00.313 --> 08:01.898
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.317
I was gonna come
and bring you all cups of tea

08:04.401 --> 08:07.279
but I kinda had a hunch
you'd expect it from then on...

08:07.362 --> 08:09.865
So I've left a box of tea
in the kitchen for you.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.199
Sounds good.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.744
And there's plenty of sugar
in there, too.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.454
Oh, sorry,
I'm Amy by the way!

08:15.537 --> 08:18.081
- Okay so, intros done, yeah?
- Yes.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.834
Can we just get
one thing clear?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.713
Down here is the
construction site.

08:24.796 --> 08:28.341
Up there is our home,
and it's off limits.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.677
You understand?

08:30.761 --> 08:31.762
Yeah, oh, on that.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.847
Look, the mobile signals
a bit in and out

08:33.929 --> 08:36.015
and it's a two hour round trip
to the supplier,

08:36.099 --> 08:38.727
so I was just wondering
if I could use the landline?

08:40.812 --> 08:43.815
I'll run an extension cable
by the porch, how's that?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.569
That's fine, yeah.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.779
Okay.
Alright, come on, let's go.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.281
Shall we?

08:51.365 --> 08:52.532
Yeah.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.497
- Seem alright?
- Yeah.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.526
<i>Hey? Hello?</i>

09:28.527 --> 09:29.611
<i>Are you there?</i>

09:29.695 --> 09:31.071
<i>Hi, it's Jim.</i>

09:31.154 --> 09:32.447
<i>Jim!</i>

09:32.823 --> 09:34.491
You don't need to know
where I am, okay?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.493
I'm lying low,
keeping my head down.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.414
The Hounslow job.
The warehouse.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.586
When I turned around, there was
this fucking security guard

09:46.670 --> 09:48.213
running at me, okay?

09:48.296 --> 09:51.299
It was FUBAR.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.636
Fucking Google it!

09:54.720 --> 09:56.888
Look, I just lost it, okay?

09:57.472 --> 09:58.682
He was a mess.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.892
I need a passport.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.937
Hey.
Are you there?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.496
Okay.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.708
- Ooh.
- Here you go, sir.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.334
Cheers, thank you.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.386
You know, when I was your age,
we had all hills like this,

10:36.470 --> 10:39.306
black as tar from the works.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.686
Trees, bushes, everything,
coated in shit!

10:47.898 --> 10:49.483
Everyone had a cough

10:49.566 --> 10:53.445
but everyone had work.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.992
I always wanted to travel

10:59.076 --> 11:02.788
but it just never
seemed to happen.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.375
I've only left
the valleys twice.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.630
It's been three years for me
away from home.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.256
This my last job.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.841
Last one?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.594
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.637
- What's happening, boys?
- This is the life, hey?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.430
Oh, that smells well nice.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.016
You're a lot good at cooking,
ain't ya?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.769
I still can't get this bloody
Wi-Fi, Bob.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.355
Yeah, we're on a rock

11:28.438 --> 11:29.981
in the middle of sheep country,
Steve, yeah?

11:30.065 --> 11:31.316
- Just leave that for a bit, mate.
- Don't be an idiot, mate,

11:31.400 --> 11:32.776
you can get Wi-Fi, everywhere,
Bob.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.403
Do you know that?
It's everywhere.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.988
What's with my fucking phone,
man?

11:37.072 --> 11:38.657
It's a joke!

11:38.740 --> 11:40.200
How's there no Wi-Fi here?

11:40.283 --> 11:42.577
We're here for three months,
Bob!

11:42.661 --> 11:44.538
What we gonna do,
there's no Facebook?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.289
No Netflix?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.542
For three months, man.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.294
What are you lot laughing for?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.587
What we gonna do?
There's no porn!

11:54.464 --> 11:56.883
For three months man,
fucking hell, man.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.302
That's human rights
to have Wi-Fi.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.472
What you laughing for?
I've got needs, man.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.683
That's fucking abuse!

12:05.308 --> 12:06.601
- For fuck's sake.
- Listen.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.104
- What?
- Stop complaining, alright?

12:09.187 --> 12:10.522
You could be somewhere
a lot worse than this,

12:10.605 --> 12:12.941
you remember that, alright?
You're a lucky lad.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.069
Here's to a good job
being done on time, yeah?

12:17.154 --> 12:18.947
Yeah. Cheers.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.325
Three months?
Fucking good luck with that.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.243
Yeah well,
you heard what he said,

12:23.326 --> 12:24.828
we've got no choice, yeah?

12:28.040 --> 12:30.167
- Who's in?
- Yep.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.302
Deal the foreigner out?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.970
Well done, big boy.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.389
Is it because I have
different passport?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.518
It's not like getting a passport
is hard thing.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.563
Or is it?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.482
I'm done.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.734
Hey, Vik!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.452
Right!

13:47.869 --> 13:48.954
Change of plan.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.831
The hay barn...
flatten it.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.709
Aye, we're on a break, okay?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.294
What the hell's
going on in here?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.088
Get back to work!
Now!

14:02.050 --> 14:03.802
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

14:04.302 --> 14:05.887
You're not in the army anymore.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.059
This is my land.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.312
Show me some fucking respect!

14:15.564 --> 14:17.482
Or you are off this job.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.444
All of you.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.007
Ooh!

14:42.090 --> 14:43.633
High stakes tonight, lads.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.969
What kind of bloody hand
is that?

14:49.765 --> 14:51.141
Shit cards!

14:52.851 --> 14:54.936
Mugs game we ain't got
any money anyway.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.189
Ah, bollocks.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.482
Whoa!
Look lively.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.859
It's the captain cockspangle,
sir!

15:02.527 --> 15:04.237
Glass beads for savages,
yeah?

15:04.321 --> 15:06.365
Hey, you, behave, yeah?

15:07.616 --> 15:08.784
Hiya!
How are you?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.369
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Good evening.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.789
I thought we better
clear the air.

15:14.373 --> 15:17.042
Oh, well, that's very nice
of you, cheers!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.210
Nice bottle of plonk, hey?

15:18.293 --> 15:19.586
- Ooh.
- Here we go.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.171
I'll be mother.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.298
- Cheers, lad.
- There you go.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.801
- Alright.
- Cheers, Bob.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.011
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Mother. Cheers.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.346
Nice drop there.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.015
- Mm-hmm.
- That's cracking that.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.851
Show it some respect.
It's a '98 Chateau Fonsalette.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.770
You're supposed
to let her breathe.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.568
So um,
so what are we playing?

15:53.370 --> 15:55.414
Right, look.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.293
Maybe I, maybe I lost my cool
a little earlier,

16:00.377 --> 16:03.338
but this is my house,
these are my rules.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.093
and if I was a bit abrupt,
well then that's just me.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.637
You'll get used to it.

16:10.721 --> 16:12.389
It's alright.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.224
We understand, yeah?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.059
How much you pay
for this wine?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.229
I don't know.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.981
She's been in the cellar
for years.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.734
I imagine she'd retail at
something like ninety...

16:23.817 --> 16:25.652
...ninety-five today.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.280
Here's to sitting on
the top of the mountains

16:28.363 --> 16:30.115
and drinking 100 Euro wine!

16:30.198 --> 16:31.658
Cheers, bud!

16:31.742 --> 16:33.243
It is good.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.831
So are we playing or what,
gentlemen?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.418
You have to sling in the keys
to that Merc outside,

16:41.501 --> 16:43.211
if you want dealing in.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.258
Well it's a quid small blind,
two quid big blind so...

16:48.341 --> 16:50.302
I think I can stretch to that.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.477
So you're army then, yeah?

16:58.560 --> 16:59.811
I was.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.272
You ever kill anyone?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.858
Not today.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.820
My sister's boy was army.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.615
- Welsh Guards?
- Yeah.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.450
Yeah, they're good men.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.035
Walking down the street
in Helmand,

17:15.117 --> 17:17.662
with a squaddy
from Ebbw Vale.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.332
Head blown clean off.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.834
What?

17:23.919 --> 17:25.127
Well better that than some
of them coming home

17:25.212 --> 17:27.005
with bits missing,
fucked in the head,

17:27.089 --> 17:28.339
you know what I mean?

17:28.423 --> 17:30.300
He's a right buzz killer,
this one, ain't he?

17:31.301 --> 17:32.968
I'm fucking warning you,

17:33.053 --> 17:34.304
you fucking start on me again,
I'll have you hear me?

17:34.388 --> 17:35.639
Whoa! Hey!

17:35.722 --> 17:36.555
Fold.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.269
So, the army...

17:42.312 --> 17:44.064
Jumped or pushed?

17:44.439 --> 17:45.691
You know what,
I'll have a slice.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.568
I see your two
and I raise you five.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.028
Fold.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.738
Sack of shit.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.742
I see you and I raise 10.

17:57.828 --> 18:01.039
Oh, that's another fiver.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.082
What?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.751
What?

18:06.962 --> 18:09.131
Oh, fucking hell.
Fold.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.593
Just you and I with the
stomach for a fight then?

18:14.845 --> 18:16.388
It's Viktor, isn't it?

18:16.471 --> 18:18.557
Show us more cards.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.188
So, what brings you down here,
Captain?

18:25.272 --> 18:27.232
You're a long way south
of the border.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.860
I might ask you
the same thing.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.575
No, my great-great-grandfather
won her from General Evans,

18:36.658 --> 18:37.868
Boer war.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.037
He too was something
of a poker player.

18:43.832 --> 18:48.128
So, who's got the Queen?
Huh?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.799
Show me your cards.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.011
Well if you want to see
my cards,

18:56.094 --> 18:57.637
it's gonna cost you.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.348
One hundred.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.728
He ain't eve got a teener
to his name.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.773
Bastard.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.364
What the fuck you doing, Vik?

19:31.046 --> 19:32.964
Show me.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.220
Ah! Jesus Christ.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.930
Oh!

19:40.722 --> 19:42.974
Oh dear dear dear dear.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.270
Oh! You bastard!

19:47.354 --> 19:49.398
You jammy bastard!

19:51.066 --> 19:53.318
You fucking jammy bastard!

19:55.112 --> 19:57.698
- I think I should be going.
- Oh, fucking hell...

19:58.365 --> 19:59.616
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.994
Goodnight Colonel.
Thank you very much!

20:16.633 --> 20:19.469
No mention of when our fucking
money's coming I noticed.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.184
How'd ya?
Fuck...

20:32.232 --> 20:33.942
Sorry, Miss.
Sorry

20:34.693 --> 20:35.944
Hey.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.738
I just wanted to ask you,

20:37.821 --> 20:40.866
can you tell me where is the
nearest post office here please?

20:42.075 --> 20:44.536
Er, I can post it if you like?
We are going that way.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.455
It's er...

20:47.581 --> 20:48.749
Or you're welcome
to go yourself,

20:48.832 --> 20:50.584
but it's an hour drive.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.545
No, no no no.
Please, thank you.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.592
Sending money home?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.510
It's for my daughter.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.513
Ah.
Daughter and her mother?

21:03.597 --> 21:07.142
That's complicated.
Thank you anyway.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.935
Are you goin' away?

21:09.936 --> 21:12.522
Just to London for work,
not for long.

21:12.606 --> 21:13.899
See you when you get back.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.942
Thank you for that,
I really appreciate it.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.944
Sure, no worries.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.364
Thanks. Bye.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.307
Oh.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.111
Yeah, it's me again.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.280
Sorry about all the messages,
it's just...

22:43.363 --> 22:44.990
I really...

22:45.574 --> 22:47.409
- Fuck!
- Mr. Hegarty, Simon. Hi.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.619
I see the roof's not up yet.

22:49.703 --> 22:50.996
Yeah, I need to talk to you
about that.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.247
I can't talk now.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.041
Well It's just that the money
to cash flow,

22:54.124 --> 22:55.500
the materials,
you know, pay my men.

22:55.584 --> 22:56.752
It's 3 weeks overdue now.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.296
I appreciate that,
but like I said,

22:59.379 --> 23:01.214
it's all tied up in stocks.

23:01.298 --> 23:03.258
You know what
accountants are like.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.680
Bob.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.308
I'm off to the yard.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.268
Did he say when
the money is here?

23:13.352 --> 23:15.645
Don't worry about that.
That's all under control, okay?

23:15.729 --> 23:17.272
Go into town,
get some provisions for tonight.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.816
Something nice, yeah?
A bit of a morale boost.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.777
And some bleach to get that shit
off the wall, yeah?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.904
And be quick, yeah?
I need you back here.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.183
<i>The Seagulls

23:53.266 --> 23:55.644
<i>over to Alister
for the latest from Lords.</i>

23:55.727 --> 23:59.064
Ugh! Bloody cricket!

23:59.147 --> 24:01.692
Wandering around a field
in your pajamas!

24:02.150 --> 24:03.318
Tea time and tourists

24:03.402 --> 24:05.654
and stopping for bloody
cucumber sandwiches.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.572
It's hardly a sport,
really is it?

24:07.656 --> 24:09.116
There we are,
that's better.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.701
<i>The security guard

24:10.784 --> 24:14.246

24:14.329 --> 24:16.832

24:19.835 --> 24:21.086
Fuck off, man.

24:21.169 --> 24:22.504
Me and Jim were listening
to the sport on that.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.214
Come on,
me and Jim were listening

24:24.297 --> 24:26.341
to the Millwall game on that.
Weren't we, Jim?

24:26.425 --> 24:29.094
What was the score then,
sir wank-a-lot? Huh?

24:29.177 --> 24:30.512
It's just a bit of static, man.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.305
- Keep talking, old man.
- Hey, here, I'll tell what,

24:32.389 --> 24:33.724
the Archers are on next.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.851
- You like the Archers, don't you?
- Keep talking.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.227
You told me that you love
listening to The Archers!

24:37.310 --> 24:38.270
Keep talking all the time!

24:38.353 --> 24:39.438
Yeah, you do!

24:43.734 --> 24:46.445
- Oi! What the hell's going on?
- Shut up, you midget!

24:46.528 --> 24:48.405
That's more than
a fucking style, isn't it,

24:48.488 --> 24:49.656
you little prick?!

24:50.741 --> 24:52.075
- Oi! Dave!
- Bloody asshole of a boy.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.285
- You! Get in here!
- Shut up.

24:53.368 --> 24:54.703
Get in here!

24:56.163 --> 24:57.539
I don't know why Bob
bothered bringing

24:57.622 --> 24:59.666
the fucking prick
down here anyway.

26:09.444 --> 26:10.737
Hey.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.282
Hey, I was just...

26:15.659 --> 26:18.286
It's all good,
I saw the van.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.039
Yeah.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.878
It's beautiful here, right?

26:28.004 --> 26:29.464
Yeah.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.760
Every time I go to the yard,
I stop here,

26:34.845 --> 26:36.680
it reminds me of home.

27:31.526 --> 27:33.945
Do you want a ride
back home in van?

27:34.029 --> 27:35.614
No, I'm good.
I'll um...

27:35.697 --> 27:37.407
I'll see you later.

27:39.785 --> 27:41.536
See you back home.

27:51.922 --> 27:53.340
Come on, Dave,
what can I say?

27:53.423 --> 27:55.258
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

27:55.342 --> 27:58.011
The damp in this place
is playing hell with my joints.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.471
What is going on?

28:00.680 --> 28:01.765
Captain Cockspangle
has gone back on us

28:01.848 --> 28:03.392
moving into the barn.

28:04.351 --> 28:05.477
Yep.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.020
He said now that he's not
going to London.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.064
Things would be a bit too cozy
between the barn and the house.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.774
Five of use in here
another fucking month,

28:10.857 --> 28:12.901
this little box.
You mad?

28:12.984 --> 28:15.404
- He's making a mug of you, Bob!
- Yeah, any day now, right.

28:15.487 --> 28:16.905
Any day, I promise.
Alright.

28:16.988 --> 28:18.949
Look, he's liquidizing
some assets or something!

28:19.032 --> 28:20.367
You said that last week.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.327
Pack your bags, Vik,
we're off.

28:22.411 --> 28:25.330
I cannot do that,
I have to send money home.

28:25.414 --> 28:28.250
Look, what're you gonna
spend it on up here?

28:28.333 --> 28:30.585
Come on, what does it matter
when you're gonna get it?

28:30.669 --> 28:32.546
As long as you're
gonna get it!

28:33.672 --> 28:34.673
He's right.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.260
You guarantee
the money Tuesday?

28:40.846 --> 28:42.472
I say we stay.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.809
Tuesday, yeah?

28:45.892 --> 28:49.646
I promise you big thick
wedges of cash on Tuesday.

28:49.730 --> 28:50.981
Yeah? Dave?

28:51.064 --> 28:52.941
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday.

28:54.735 --> 28:57.904
Okay, Tuesday.

29:04.536 --> 29:07.289
So the blonde one appears
incapable of going

29:07.372 --> 29:09.833
more than two minutes
without spitting.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.711
I can barely understand
the Eastern European one.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.796
You know the stocky one?
the Scot?

29:16.006 --> 29:17.883
There's just something about him
I don't like.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.803
How did the fundraiser go?

29:21.887 --> 29:23.430
Yeah, it was good actually.

29:23.513 --> 29:26.141
I forget, your accountant
was there, what's his name?

29:26.224 --> 29:28.060
- Richard.
- Richard, yes.

29:29.394 --> 29:31.313
Didn't really figure it to be
an accountant's thing,

29:31.396 --> 29:33.815
but he asked me
to tell you to call him.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.568
He said it was urgent,
something about tax

29:36.651 --> 29:38.820
or a shelter or something.

29:39.654 --> 29:41.073
Sorry, I wan't really listening,

29:41.156 --> 29:43.617
there were some city boys
outside starting a food fight.

29:44.493 --> 29:46.453
No, it's fine.
I'll call him.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.806
Hi, Pete?

30:05.889 --> 30:08.058
Hello Pete, it's Bob.
Yeah, Bob Pearson.

30:09.351 --> 30:10.727
Yeah, I'm sorry
it's so late, mate.

30:10.811 --> 30:14.022
Um, listen, just quickly,
I've got a bloke with me

30:14.106 --> 30:16.441
who says he's grafted
with you before. Yeah.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.485
Jim.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.612
Jim Ainsworth?

30:25.492 --> 30:27.327
Yeah.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.690
Hey, Jim.
Jim, have a look.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.316
Have a look, 12 o'clock.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.403
That's a bit crumpet, mate.
Ooh!

31:01.486 --> 31:03.947
About time we had a bit of
entertainment around here.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.117
Go, Captain!

31:09.578 --> 31:11.329
Come on, guys.
That's not okay.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.165
We shouldn't watch it,
let's go inside.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.250
What, you jealous,
are you, Viktor?

31:16.084 --> 31:18.295
- What did you said?
- Huh?

31:18.378 --> 31:19.713
What did you said?

31:19.796 --> 31:21.256
I said are you jealous?

31:21.339 --> 31:22.382
Listen, stop taking the piss,

31:22.466 --> 31:23.633
I'm gonna slap you
like a little bitch.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.844
Yeah? Yeah?

31:25.927 --> 31:28.180
Keep touching me.
Look, what you touching me for?

31:28.263 --> 31:29.598
What did you just say?

31:30.348 --> 31:31.183
What did you say,
I couldn't hear ya.

31:31.266 --> 31:32.768
What'd ya say?

31:33.060 --> 31:34.811
Go inside
when I say you to go.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.730
Hey!
What's going on?

31:37.981 --> 31:38.857
Oh, okay.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.025
Come on,
have a little watch.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.651
Alright.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.237
Alright, show's over.
Inside. Inside!

31:44.321 --> 31:45.155
Hey!

31:46.531 --> 31:48.241
Get inside or I'll send you
back to your parents.

31:48.325 --> 31:50.202
You can deal
with that shit yourself.

31:50.285 --> 31:51.912
Get in.

31:52.996 --> 31:54.748
Touch me again,
you little prick.

31:55.374 --> 31:58.210
Okay, listen, Jim.

32:00.087 --> 32:03.382
I don't think this country larks
up your street, is it really?

32:03.465 --> 32:05.717
So, I think it's best
that just the four of us

32:05.801 --> 32:07.636
finish this, alright?

32:08.470 --> 32:10.013
Who have you been speaking to?

32:11.139 --> 32:12.808
No one.

32:12.891 --> 32:14.643
I'm the boss here, okay?

32:14.726 --> 32:17.020
I don't like the way you're
rubbing off on my nephew.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.731
Brian Gartside,

32:19.815 --> 32:22.984
Pete Ranger or the Russian?

32:25.904 --> 32:27.614
No.

32:27.698 --> 32:30.158
I just think
it's best that you go.

32:32.244 --> 32:34.079
When you sack a man, Bob,

32:34.162 --> 32:36.123
it's customary to pay him
what you owe.

32:36.206 --> 32:38.709
You can't do that,
can you?

32:40.001 --> 32:43.088
And your letting
Captain Dickface up there

32:43.171 --> 32:46.341
run over the top of you,
it's fucking pathetic.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.760
You need more men on this job,
not fewer.

32:48.844 --> 32:50.887
If you're gonna
bring it in on time,

32:50.971 --> 32:52.848
avoid penalties.

32:54.433 --> 32:55.726
Alright.

32:55.809 --> 32:59.646
I'm gonna pay you,
and I want you gone.

33:05.193 --> 33:08.196
Just remember,
if the police come round here,

33:08.280 --> 33:12.075
all they're gonna find
is cash in hand tax fraud

33:12.159 --> 33:15.203
and an illegal fucking
immigrant.

33:35.182 --> 33:36.141
Richard?

33:36.224 --> 33:37.976
The builders
are getting restless.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.020
Do you have any news
on the inheritance?

33:40.687 --> 33:42.105
That's the least
of your worries.

33:42.189 --> 33:46.193
Simon, I had a call.

33:46.943 --> 33:48.153
The Caymans.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.905
<i>The inheritance trust?</i>

33:50.489 --> 33:53.200
Christ, Richard,
you said this was legitimate.

33:53.283 --> 33:55.077
It seems the FCA's
interpretation of

33:55.160 --> 33:57.454
"Essence of the Law"
now differs from ours.

33:57.537 --> 33:59.122
<i>They're closing the scheme
down Thursday.</i>

33:59.206 --> 34:01.875
Warrants, dawn raids,
the whole shebang.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.837
<i>Oh! Okay.
Worse case?</i>

34:06.671 --> 34:08.172
<i>They consider it evasion.</i>

34:08.255 --> 34:09.841
<i>You get hit at everything
that's in there,</i>

34:09.925 --> 34:11.385
<i>plus the family house
in Wales.</i>

34:11.467 --> 34:13.887
<i>What? Lose the family home
and the Hegarty fortune</i>

34:13.969 --> 34:16.139
<i>to the fucking tax man?</i>

34:16.223 --> 34:17.391
<i>This is an inside tip off.</i>

34:17.474 --> 34:19.393
<i>We have a small window
of opportunity.</i>

34:19.476 --> 34:21.268
<i>The raids don't happen
until Thursday.</i>

34:21.353 --> 34:22.728
So?

34:22.813 --> 34:24.980
<i>I told you I'd been making
contingency plans.</i>

34:25.065 --> 34:26.900
<i>That's why you pay me, Simon.</i>

34:28.527 --> 34:30.404
<i>I've set up a holding company,
a shell.</i>

34:30.487 --> 34:32.154
<i>You get some sun
on your face...</i>

34:32.239 --> 34:34.449
<i>You pull the money out in cash,
walk across the street,</i>

34:34.533 --> 34:36.784
<i>stick it in the new company,
go for a dip.</i>

34:36.868 --> 34:38.786
<i>The tax man will knock
the door down on Monday.</i>

34:38.870 --> 34:40.455
When it's empty.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.208
Oh, you will need a signatory.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.210
<i>I'll have Amy get her passport
from London.</i>

34:49.089 --> 34:51.842
Bloody freezing,
no fucking money!

34:51.924 --> 34:53.342
Fucking hell!

35:18.577 --> 35:19.828
Shit!

35:32.674 --> 35:34.092
<i>Ooh!</i>

35:34.176 --> 35:36.845
<i>Right, come on, lads,
up and at it, rise and shine.</i>

35:36.928 --> 35:39.765
<i>It's Tuesday!
It's fucking pay day, boys!</i>

35:42.434 --> 35:43.518
All I'm saying is,

35:43.602 --> 35:46.271
that one day
we won't be countries,

35:46.355 --> 35:49.608
we'll be named after brands
and corporations.

35:49.691 --> 35:50.609
Dave.

35:50.692 --> 35:51.860
You're more of a fucking
communist

35:51.943 --> 35:53.570
than Sputnik sometimes,
you know that?

35:55.030 --> 35:56.406
Right, so you up for making
a night of it then?

35:56.490 --> 35:58.700
Spend a bit of that hard earned
cash in Cardiff?

35:58.784 --> 36:00.577
You got people right,

36:00.660 --> 36:03.914
who can sit burning bank notes
day and night,

36:03.997 --> 36:06.541
and still not get through them
in their lifetime.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.419
Now, where's the justice
in that, huh?

36:09.503 --> 36:10.879
Don't matter how rich you are.

36:10.962 --> 36:13.298
You only got one asshole,
one pair of feet,

36:13.382 --> 36:16.593
and we all end up in the same
sized fucking hole, right?

36:17.469 --> 36:18.887
Dave?

36:18.970 --> 36:21.473
Any news on when Bob might be
here with our money, huh?

36:21.556 --> 36:23.308
Oh mate, two and a half grand
in my pocket?

36:23.392 --> 36:24.685
I'm getting the lot, man.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.354
I'm getting a hotel,
get the shots in.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.482
Get a nice little brass,
yeah the works!

36:33.777 --> 36:37.030
Hey, David,
alright, old man river?

36:38.407 --> 36:40.158
I don't suppose any of your pals
in the old people's home

36:40.242 --> 36:42.577
can get their hands on any
funky meds, can they?

36:42.661 --> 36:43.704
See that?

36:43.787 --> 36:45.414
Okay, change of plan.

36:45.497 --> 36:48.667
Rain's coming in so let's shift
to lining the barn, yeah?

36:48.750 --> 36:51.503
Steve said you had been
to the bank?

36:51.586 --> 36:54.214
Yeah. Yeah,
to pay the suppliers off.

36:54.297 --> 36:56.299
I'm seeing the Hegarty later on,
okay.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.300
You're going to get
your money tonight,

36:57.384 --> 36:58.969
so happy days, yeah?

36:59.052 --> 37:00.679
Can I have a word, Vik?

37:03.515 --> 37:04.891
What?

37:04.975 --> 37:06.184
You knew about Jim?

37:07.227 --> 37:08.895
I don't trust him, okay?

37:08.979 --> 37:11.273
I'm gonna need you later on.
I'm gonna pay him off

37:11.356 --> 37:13.900
and I want you to help me
get him off site, alright?

37:13.984 --> 37:15.152
Help you?

37:15.235 --> 37:18.280
I hear Steve has been
working half as hard.

37:18.363 --> 37:19.740
Getting paid twice
as much as me.

37:19.823 --> 37:20.824
Why should I help?

37:20.907 --> 37:23.076
Look, I'm sorry about this,
yeah.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.119
You're a good grafter.

37:24.202 --> 37:25.454
I'd give you more money
if I could,

37:25.537 --> 37:28.081
but I'm up to my neck
in debt.

37:28.165 --> 37:31.084
Look, I am being screwed
into the ground.

37:31.168 --> 37:33.420
Come on.
You took the job, yeah?

37:33.503 --> 37:34.838
You know if you didn't want it,

37:34.921 --> 37:36.631
I could have got
any one of your guys

37:36.715 --> 37:38.592
for the same money,
you know that, okay?

37:38.675 --> 37:41.845
I am sorry,
but that's just the way it is.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.513
I'm sorry, okay?

37:45.474 --> 37:46.600
Oh!

37:46.683 --> 37:48.185
Oh, Jesus!

37:48.268 --> 37:51.563
- What now?
- Oh, your idiot fucking nephew

37:51.646 --> 37:54.358
just dropped a fucking
sledgehammer on me, ah!

37:55.525 --> 37:58.070
- The fuck are you up to?
- Oh, my bastard shoulder!

37:58.153 --> 37:59.696
Get a grip, boy!

38:03.241 --> 38:05.285
Keep your hair on.
I didn't mean it. I was...

38:05.369 --> 38:07.037
Fuck's sake, Steve!

38:07.120 --> 38:09.623
Get him out.
I'm gonna get an ambulance.

38:13.293 --> 38:14.544
<i>Hello?</i>

38:17.089 --> 38:18.507
Mr. Hegarty?

38:19.174 --> 38:20.967
Simon?
It's Bob.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.638
Line's down in the porch,
we're got an emergency here.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.391
Hello?

38:31.061 --> 38:32.813
The hell are you
doing in here?

38:33.605 --> 38:35.107
Money.

38:35.816 --> 38:37.401
Not now, please.

38:39.569 --> 38:41.363
Don't touch anything.

38:43.824 --> 38:45.283
Hello?

38:46.410 --> 38:47.994
Mr. Hegarty?
It's Bob.

38:50.205 --> 38:51.790
Hello?

38:58.714 --> 39:03.218
<i>Look, I hate to ask but seeing
as all this was your idea,</i>

39:05.137 --> 39:07.264
<i>I don't trust them an inch.</i>

39:11.184 --> 39:12.853
His and hers.

39:15.355 --> 39:16.565
Nice touch.

39:16.648 --> 39:18.316
<i>Richard, I did that!</i>

39:18.400 --> 39:19.901
<i>I hit them hard on snagging.</i>

39:19.985 --> 39:22.571
<i>I tried to trigger penalties
to buy us time but no!</i>

39:22.654 --> 39:25.115
<i>They made all the deadlines!</i>

39:26.158 --> 39:27.659
<i>You need to help me
string them along,</i>

39:27.743 --> 39:30.328
<i>just for a couple of months,
until the money is clean.</i>

39:31.496 --> 39:32.664
<i>Are you serious?</i>

39:32.748 --> 39:34.666
<i>Do you know the rate
on a bridging loan?</i>

39:36.585 --> 39:38.045
<i>Yeah well,
it's like you said,</i>

39:38.128 --> 39:40.630
Pearson's firm is on
a knife-edge so,

39:40.714 --> 39:42.090
we drag out arbitration

39:42.174 --> 39:44.843
and there's a decent chance
they go bust anyway.

39:50.724 --> 39:52.351
Mr. Hegarty?

39:55.645 --> 39:58.482
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of a private conversation.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.110
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

40:02.194 --> 40:03.904
Get out of my house!

40:04.196 --> 40:06.490
You planning a holiday, eh?

40:06.573 --> 40:08.158
Or are you doing a bunk?

40:09.034 --> 40:12.621
Listen, we're not leaving
this room

40:12.704 --> 40:13.789
until I get that money.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.416
And I want that money,
I want it now.

40:16.708 --> 40:19.461
No, if you think you can
stroll in to a man's house

40:19.544 --> 40:23.256
uninvited demanding money,
then you are very much mistaken.

40:25.717 --> 40:27.928
That may be how things are done
from whatever hole it is

40:28.011 --> 40:29.846
that you come from,
but not here!

40:29.930 --> 40:31.014
Not here!
You!

40:31.098 --> 40:33.141
Okay.
Okay, so here.

40:33.225 --> 40:35.519
- Jesus, oh...
- Okay.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.187
- Need the length.
- Aye, aye, aye...

40:37.270 --> 40:38.939
Shit, Dave.

40:40.649 --> 40:42.401
Well that's game over, innit.

40:44.820 --> 40:46.279
Steve!

40:46.363 --> 40:48.281
Well how's he gonna graft,
he's got a broken collarbone?

40:48.949 --> 40:51.076
Old man can't even
pull on his boots!

40:52.327 --> 40:53.704
What you gonna do?

40:54.705 --> 40:57.332
You little fucker.

41:00.293 --> 41:01.586
- Take it easy!
- Get off me!

41:01.670 --> 41:02.963
Easy!

41:03.046 --> 41:04.214
What the fuck?

41:04.297 --> 41:07.217
Take it easy! Take it easy!
Calm down!

41:07.300 --> 41:08.468
Calm down and we'll let you go,
okay?

41:08.552 --> 41:10.095
Just calm down.

41:10.178 --> 41:12.764
Mr. Hegarty just calm down,
and I'll let you go, okay?

41:12.848 --> 41:16.309
Stay still and I can let you go,
in 3... 2... 1...

41:16.393 --> 41:18.145
Okay. Okay...

41:24.860 --> 41:27.237
Why don't you tell the guys
how you planned to rip us off?

41:27.320 --> 41:29.948
We heard him on the phone.

41:30.032 --> 41:32.451
Two tours Afghanistan,
One Iraq.

41:32.534 --> 41:34.494
Do you think I'm intimidated
by you?

41:34.578 --> 41:35.746
Give me my money!

41:35.829 --> 41:37.330
You give me what's owed
to me today, right!

41:37.414 --> 41:38.832
No pissing about now!

41:38.915 --> 41:40.292
That's just not possible.

41:40.375 --> 41:43.128
Bigger issues at play here.
You wouldn't understand.

41:43.211 --> 41:44.212
Try us.

41:45.547 --> 41:48.258
The only thing I'm giving you
is a cheer

41:48.341 --> 41:50.343
when the judge sends you back
down where you belong.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.304
Fuck you!
Fuck you, prick!

41:52.387 --> 41:54.014
Bob! Bob!
Bob, the car!

41:54.097 --> 41:55.807
The car must be worth what?
Sixty-seventy grand?

41:55.891 --> 41:57.351
We'll fucking take that,
fuck him!

41:57.434 --> 41:58.935
She's a lease.

41:59.728 --> 42:02.564
- Check the glove, boys.
- Last chance, dickhead.

42:02.647 --> 42:03.899
Money!

42:05.025 --> 42:07.778
It's not possible.

42:07.861 --> 42:10.322
What part of that do you not
fucking comprehend?

42:17.162 --> 42:18.747
Stop it!
Stop it!

42:26.880 --> 42:28.590
Stop it, boy!
Stop it!

42:28.673 --> 42:30.634
Stop! Stop!

42:51.988 --> 42:53.407
You fucking killed him.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.284
We all did.

42:56.368 --> 42:58.120
Okay, he fucking,
he tried to rip us off,

42:58.203 --> 43:00.455
then he attacked me, look!

43:00.539 --> 43:04.501
You dare fucking try to step
away from this, any of ya!

43:06.294 --> 43:07.713
Is the cunt dead then?

43:07.796 --> 43:10.716
Well he ain't doing the
fucking Macarena is he, boys?

43:28.942 --> 43:31.737
So what now?

43:33.739 --> 43:36.491
Firstly,
it was self defense.

43:36.575 --> 43:38.660
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Look at my eye.

43:38.744 --> 43:40.120
Self defense?

43:40.203 --> 43:41.705
- What the fuck you talking about?
- He hit me first!

43:41.788 --> 43:43.623
That's the reason you beat him
to death with a hammer?

43:43.707 --> 43:45.167
You trod on him!

43:45.250 --> 43:47.085
Yeah, that's probably what
killed him, you fucking Cossack.

43:47.169 --> 43:49.337
- Shut the fuck up.
- Don't tell me to shut the fuck up.

43:49.421 --> 43:51.173
He was on the floor
and you went mad

43:51.256 --> 43:53.508
and that's why we are in
the situation we're in now

43:53.592 --> 43:55.385
because you lost control.

43:55.469 --> 43:56.720
Sit down.

43:56.803 --> 43:58.305
Sit down!

43:58.388 --> 44:00.140
Sit down, everybody!

44:00.223 --> 44:02.100
Bob. Sit.

44:06.563 --> 44:07.731
Dave.

44:07.814 --> 44:10.150
Self defense my fucking ass.

44:14.696 --> 44:15.947
What?

44:16.031 --> 44:17.407
Please.

44:18.450 --> 44:20.202
I am fucking sitting.
Haven't you noticed?

44:20.285 --> 44:21.411
I'm fucking sitting here,
alright.

44:21.495 --> 44:23.747
Steve, just sit!
Sit!

44:28.377 --> 44:30.087
Okay, Bob.

44:31.171 --> 44:33.423
Okay. Since you're so fucking
polite about it.

44:33.507 --> 44:35.342
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Vik.

44:37.677 --> 44:39.304
Fucking hell.

44:43.934 --> 44:45.477
So?

44:45.560 --> 44:49.106
The captain was handed life
on a big silver plate.

44:49.189 --> 44:52.359
And he treated us like shit.

44:52.442 --> 44:54.695
Because that's precisely
what we were to him.

44:59.324 --> 45:01.743
Why ruin five lives
on account of him?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.790
One hand.

45:08.959 --> 45:10.585
The loser takes the blame.

45:10.669 --> 45:12.587
Accidental manslaughter.

45:12.671 --> 45:14.297
The rest get out of here,
fill their boots.

45:14.381 --> 45:15.841
The loser takes the blame?

45:15.924 --> 45:18.385
- And we don't look back.
- Fuck off!

45:18.468 --> 45:19.886
- Oh, Christ!
- No.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.430
I tried to stop you.
We...

45:21.513 --> 45:23.473
We tried to stop you.

45:23.557 --> 45:24.766
We?

45:26.351 --> 45:29.146
We are all in this together.

45:32.941 --> 45:36.445
This way we each have a 4/5
chance of getting out,

45:36.528 --> 45:40.949
but the loser
puts his hand up,

45:41.033 --> 45:42.576
takes the medicine,

45:44.327 --> 45:46.038
no backing out.

45:51.334 --> 45:54.504
Yeah, alright.
I mean, 4 out of 5.

45:55.172 --> 45:56.423
Yeah, I'll take them odds.

45:57.299 --> 46:00.135
So, now you want
to deal me in, huh?

46:00.218 --> 46:03.221
No, I couldn't handle
prison again, boys.

46:03.305 --> 46:04.556
Not at my age.

46:04.639 --> 46:07.392
I did 4 months once for GBH
so fuck it, thanks.

46:07.476 --> 46:09.728
Well there's always the bed
sheets ain't there, granddad?

46:11.355 --> 46:13.482
It has to be all of us, Dave.

46:22.032 --> 46:24.576
Oh, fucking hell.
What fucking choice have I got?

46:25.660 --> 46:27.704
Time for some leadership,
Bobby-boy.

46:39.132 --> 46:41.134
All eyes on you now,
Russian.

46:41.218 --> 46:43.553
You call me Russian
one more fucking time!

46:44.805 --> 46:47.349
My Uncle's fighting
fucking Russian in Donetsk...

46:51.937 --> 46:56.066
Look guys, it was self defense,
you already said it.

46:56.149 --> 46:57.901
I'm gonna make a call.

46:57.984 --> 46:59.277
What you doing?
Calling the police, are ya?

46:59.361 --> 47:01.446
Who's gonna believe
one person did all of that?

47:01.530 --> 47:03.281
Give me the fucking phone.

47:03.657 --> 47:05.242
Give me the phone.

47:06.284 --> 47:08.995
- Grass.
- Sit.

47:13.166 --> 47:14.793
So, what, if you lose,
you're gonna take the blame

47:14.876 --> 47:15.877
for all of us?

47:15.961 --> 47:18.255
That's the deal, innit?
You grass.

47:18.338 --> 47:19.631
You won't last three minutes.

47:19.715 --> 47:21.091
Yeah, is that right?

47:22.884 --> 47:26.722
Okay, lets see what the lady's
brought us this time, shall we?

47:27.264 --> 47:29.599
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

47:31.435 --> 47:32.436
Ow!

47:33.311 --> 47:35.022
Pair of Kings.

47:35.939 --> 47:37.649
Bobby's looking at ace high.

47:37.733 --> 47:39.526
Looks like he's in the clear,
too.

47:42.070 --> 47:43.613
Did you hear that?

47:43.697 --> 47:46.450
- What?
- I thought I heard something.

47:51.913 --> 47:53.540
Time for the Turn,
gentlemen.

47:57.544 --> 48:00.422
Bob's on a pair of fives,
probably home and dry.

48:03.717 --> 48:07.471
Steve and Viktor
are on shit and shit

48:07.554 --> 48:09.848
but as it stands.

48:09.931 --> 48:12.309
It looks Dave here
is the guilty party.

48:12.392 --> 48:16.855
Just take me to the river
and shut the fuck up, okay?

48:18.315 --> 48:20.817
Yes! Ow!

48:20.901 --> 48:24.154
Lady luck loves a valley boy!
Ow! Ow!

48:24.237 --> 48:25.614
It was down to the kicker,

48:25.697 --> 48:28.617
the immigrant with the hots
for the deceased's fiancé.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.911
I've see tougher sells.

48:31.536 --> 48:32.913
You rigged it.

48:33.663 --> 48:35.499
Fuck the immigrant, yeah?

48:36.750 --> 48:38.585
What was that?

48:50.013 --> 48:51.348
He's alive, men!

48:52.432 --> 48:54.101
Ah fuck.

48:55.352 --> 48:57.479
He's alive!
Christ! Christ, he's alive!

48:57.562 --> 48:59.606
He's alive!
He's alive! He's alive!

48:59.690 --> 49:00.941
We've gotta get him
to the hospital now.

49:01.024 --> 49:03.110
Nah. Nah.
I can't let you do that, Bob.

49:08.323 --> 49:09.282
What?

49:09.366 --> 49:11.618
You can't leave him like this,
Jim!

49:11.702 --> 49:14.454
You're right.
We'll do the decent thing.

49:14.538 --> 49:15.497
What do you mean?

49:15.580 --> 49:16.998
We finish the job we started.

49:18.709 --> 49:21.670
No.
Look, no.

49:21.753 --> 49:22.754
No!

49:23.463 --> 49:24.464
Together.

49:25.215 --> 49:26.883
Oh, fuck off!

49:26.967 --> 49:28.552
Don't forget what we did.

49:29.511 --> 49:30.971
Because he won't!

49:31.054 --> 49:32.514
Hey?
He's got lawyers,

49:32.597 --> 49:34.725
reputation and the system
on his side!

49:34.808 --> 49:38.729
We'll get some 2-bit fucking
graduate on two hours kip!

49:38.812 --> 49:41.314
With fucking legal aid,
if we're lucky.

49:41.398 --> 49:42.733
We'll get crucified!

49:42.816 --> 49:44.609
We may as well have
fucking killed him!

49:45.444 --> 49:46.778
No. Hang on a minute,
hang on!

49:46.862 --> 49:51.533
Listen Captain,
I know rich blokes.

49:51.616 --> 49:54.077
They've always got a nest egg
stashed away somewhere.

49:54.161 --> 49:56.413
You know, maybe if you paid us
what we're owed,

49:56.496 --> 49:59.374
we would be more disposed
to us getting you to a hospital.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.917
Let's get this over with,
Dave.

50:01.001 --> 50:02.544
Is there money in the house?

50:02.627 --> 50:05.672
Fucking tell me,
is there money in the house?

50:05.756 --> 50:06.757
What is it?

50:06.840 --> 50:08.091
He's nodding!
He's fucking nodding!

50:08.175 --> 50:09.968
Did you see him,
he's fucking nodding!

50:10.052 --> 50:12.763
We get the money
and take him to the hospital.

50:12.846 --> 50:14.514
Right now!

50:15.057 --> 50:17.309
Yeah? Please.

50:24.483 --> 50:25.609
Well that's the last of that.

50:25.692 --> 50:27.611
Okay. Right.

50:27.694 --> 50:30.155
It splits it's just over two
and a half grand each.

50:30.238 --> 50:32.282
No.
No, it doesn't work like that.

50:32.366 --> 50:33.700
I'm in a hole, alright?

50:33.784 --> 50:35.327
- There's materials...
- Here she is.

50:40.540 --> 50:41.833
What are you doing?

50:41.917 --> 50:43.627
Fuck's sake, Jim!

50:43.710 --> 50:46.296
Dave, it's out money!
We're owed it!

50:47.422 --> 50:49.049
Two, seven, one, zero.

50:54.513 --> 50:56.264
Ah, Jesus Christ.

50:56.848 --> 50:58.433
Oh, Jesus.

50:59.810 --> 51:00.852
I've been mugged.

51:06.692 --> 51:07.901
Look.

51:12.072 --> 51:13.699
It's an offshore account.

51:14.991 --> 51:17.327
Lads!
It's an offshore account!

51:18.662 --> 51:20.455
You need more than change
for one of these.

51:22.624 --> 51:24.710
- Hey, what about the password?
- He's got it!

51:34.302 --> 51:35.595
Simon...

51:37.347 --> 51:38.765
Simon, listen to me.

51:39.975 --> 51:43.061
Just give us what we're owed
and I will get you to A&E.

51:43.145 --> 51:45.355
I promise you that,
we'll go our separate ways.

51:46.231 --> 51:47.607
You have my word.

51:50.318 --> 51:51.695
Caymans.

51:52.029 --> 51:53.238
Must be nice.

51:55.323 --> 51:56.742
Log in.

51:58.326 --> 51:59.995
This is an offshore account

52:00.078 --> 52:02.706
not some fucking
High Street branch.

52:02.789 --> 52:08.670
It's passports, fingerprints,
signatures, the lot.

52:08.754 --> 52:10.547
So, what is there
a transfer option then?

52:11.798 --> 52:12.632
Eh?

52:12.716 --> 52:15.427
You're gonna kill me anyway.

52:15.510 --> 52:17.971
Why the fuck
would I help you?

52:20.432 --> 52:22.225
Just type it in, Simon.

52:28.398 --> 52:30.901
Password. Now.

52:32.361 --> 52:33.987
- Last chance.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:34.071 --> 52:36.448
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, hey, hey.

52:36.531 --> 52:38.784
- I'll go bankrupt.
- All this has gone too far.

52:38.867 --> 52:40.369
- It's gotta stop!
- Last chance.

52:40.452 --> 52:42.454
Don't!
Don't do it!

52:42.537 --> 52:44.122
- This has gone too far!
- What the fuck are we doing?

52:44.206 --> 52:45.540
It's gotta stop!

52:46.958 --> 52:48.210
Last chance, Captain.

52:51.004 --> 52:52.839
Password, you fucking...!

52:54.758 --> 52:56.218
Password!

52:56.885 --> 52:59.221
Oh my God!

52:59.304 --> 53:02.599
Patrol 414...
Patrol 414.

53:02.682 --> 53:04.643
You fucking animal!

53:04.726 --> 53:06.186
Jesus!

53:08.647 --> 53:10.440
It says 2.4 million.

53:13.568 --> 53:14.820
Look, it says it!

53:15.946 --> 53:17.823
There's 2.4 million.

53:19.533 --> 53:21.535
Well we should take only
what we are due.

53:21.618 --> 53:23.995
No, we take the lot.

53:24.079 --> 53:26.456
A little slither of this worth
a fucking mansion

53:26.540 --> 53:28.125
in your mud hole.

53:28.208 --> 53:29.835
We're not thieves.

53:29.918 --> 53:31.420
You don't want your money?

53:31.920 --> 53:33.714
Fucking more
for the rest of us.

53:37.217 --> 53:38.802
There'll be a threshold.

53:40.178 --> 53:41.763
Keep it under mil.

53:48.729 --> 53:50.564
Ah, fucking hell!

53:52.357 --> 53:54.568
You bastard.

53:54.651 --> 53:57.195
Well we can't take him to
fucking hospital now, can we?

54:02.159 --> 54:03.035
Phones.

54:03.952 --> 54:06.288
Everyone, put your phones
in the bucket.

54:06.371 --> 54:08.415
Put your phones
in the fucking bucket now.

54:10.459 --> 54:12.210
No backstabbing,
no backroom deals.

54:12.294 --> 54:14.629
We're all in this together.
Phones in the bucket now.

54:20.469 --> 54:22.262
We finish this the way
we started.

54:22.345 --> 54:23.722
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

54:28.310 --> 54:29.811
Together.

55:04.096 --> 55:06.556
I did basic training once,
Captain, when I was a kid.

55:07.349 --> 55:08.767
Just out of my teens.

55:08.850 --> 55:10.686
Judge thought it might
straighten me out.

55:11.895 --> 55:13.355
It was that or jail.

55:15.357 --> 55:17.234
We might have ended up
in the same regiment,

55:18.402 --> 55:19.861
fancy that.

55:22.656 --> 55:24.074
It didn't though,

55:25.867 --> 55:27.619
straighten me out.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.041
Turns out
I've got a low tolerance

55:33.125 --> 55:34.793
for being treated like shit

55:34.876 --> 55:37.129
- by people like you.
- Just get on with it then.

55:50.100 --> 55:51.518
Take it.

56:09.411 --> 56:10.829
Dig!

56:10.912 --> 56:13.081
Use the fucking barrow
for Christ's sake,

56:13.165 --> 56:15.083
I can't dig.

56:15.751 --> 56:17.753
We do this together!

56:17.836 --> 56:20.005
Dig! Dig!

57:43.046 --> 57:44.506
Jim's on the run.

57:45.716 --> 57:47.467
He's already killed a guard
in a robbery.

57:48.385 --> 57:49.845
And I knew.

57:51.596 --> 57:52.723
Makes you wonder
what he had planned

57:52.806 --> 57:55.392
if we'd got out money,
don't it?

58:15.412 --> 58:17.539
<i>Simon, darling, are you ready?
We're gonna be late.</i>

58:18.957 --> 58:19.791
Simon?

58:30.343 --> 58:31.678
Simon?

58:35.640 --> 58:36.600
Simon?

58:36.683 --> 58:38.602
Shh!
Calm down! Calm down!

58:38.685 --> 58:40.395
It's me, it's me.
It's Viktor.

58:40.479 --> 58:42.272
Calm down.
Calm down, please.

58:42.356 --> 58:45.150
Listen, I'm going
to remove my hand,

58:45.233 --> 58:47.194
but you have to promise
to be silent.

58:48.236 --> 58:50.614
Look, bad things
have happened here.

58:50.697 --> 58:52.240
We have to run away
immediately.

58:52.324 --> 58:55.660
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

58:57.579 --> 58:59.247
Where's Simon?

58:59.331 --> 59:00.332
He's...

59:01.166 --> 59:03.251
Stop!
We must escape now!

59:16.515 --> 59:17.808
Where's Simon?

59:21.144 --> 59:22.854
Where is he, please?

59:25.982 --> 59:28.485
Alright, you see,
it's like this.

59:29.403 --> 59:35.158
I don't know how much he shared
with you about his er,

59:35.242 --> 59:37.577
financial situation...

59:41.915 --> 59:44.376
Financial situation?
Not much.

59:44.459 --> 59:48.630
Okay, because maybe you knew
he was having some problems.

59:51.341 --> 59:57.013
It seems the good captain was
all fur coat and no knickers.

59:59.182 --> 01:00:01.184
If you'll pardon
the expression.

01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:08.108
Obviously, we wish
we'd known sooner but...

01:00:08.191 --> 01:00:12.612
it seems that his financial
situation has come to a head

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:16.408
and he has done a bunk.

01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.912
He's done a bunk?

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:25.125
A bunk, yeah.

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:30.005
Stuck two fingers up
to the tax man

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:33.383
and the bank
and off he has fucked.

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:35.677
Happens more often
than you think,

01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:43.143
but it has left us
significantly out of pocket.

01:00:47.189 --> 01:00:49.191
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:53.820
Well I'm sorry to break it
to you like this.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:01:00.452
Maybe, maybe he thought
he could do the place up,

01:01:00.535 --> 01:01:02.371
sell it on,
make a quick profit.

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:04.122
Bail himself out?

01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:06.291
Bob?

01:01:10.462 --> 01:01:12.714
Explains the tight deadline.

01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:22.182
There you go.

01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:26.561
Thank you.

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:50.043
Well that's terrible.

01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:56.258
Terrible, I mean, after all the
work you've done for him.

01:01:58.885 --> 01:02:01.555
Yeah, you can imagine
how we feel.

01:02:01.638 --> 01:02:02.973
Hmm.

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:07.519
And you have no idea
where he's gone?

01:02:07.602 --> 01:02:08.895
No.

01:02:11.273 --> 01:02:12.441
Do you?

01:02:12.524 --> 01:02:14.568
No, I have no idea.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.536
- There's a joint account.
- A joint account?

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:27.122
Yep. We have one together,
we're engaged.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:28.540
I could go in to Cardiff
tomorrow morning

01:02:28.623 --> 01:02:30.709
and draw the money out.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.127
As Simon's left you
in the lurch

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.671
after all the work you've done,
it only seems fair.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:39.342
How much is in
the joint account?

01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:43.180
Not much,
15, 16 grand.

01:02:43.263 --> 01:02:45.182
Something like that.

01:02:46.516 --> 01:02:47.726
Probably a fraction of what
you're owed but you know,

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.394
if it would help?

01:02:57.235 --> 01:02:58.528
I'm sorry I have
to break the news

01:02:58.612 --> 01:03:00.739
about your fiancé like this.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:08.246
You know, I'd been starting to
have second thoughts anyway.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.581
Guess this seals it.

01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:11.124
I guess.

01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:15.420
I'm sorry.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:22.719
Given that the captain
has already run out on us,

01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:27.808
I'm sure you will understand
that we are a bit wary

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.644
of lightning striking twice.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.566
So, you'll be staying
here tonight.

01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:40.153
- But all my things are in the house.
- I know.

01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:44.491
But, it's not up
for discussion.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.089
But Viktor,
you'll be coming with us.

01:04:00.882 --> 01:04:03.385
Where you off to then,
lover boy?

01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.053
Riding off into the sunset?

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:08.557
I just wanted her to be safe.
I didn't have any plan.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.684
Bless! Is she your
girlfriend then, is she?

01:04:14.021 --> 01:04:15.105
- In you get!
- No!

01:04:15.188 --> 01:04:16.898
In you fucking go.

01:04:17.858 --> 01:04:20.527
<i>Guys, it's not funny,
it stinks!</i>

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.988
<i>Let me out.
Let me out!</i>

01:04:24.614 --> 01:04:26.408
<i>Guys!
Let me out!</i>

01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:27.492
<i>Please!</i>

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.411
<i>Please!</i>

01:04:33.165 --> 01:04:34.624
<i>Guys!</i>

01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:39.087
Bob?

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.842
Bob?

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:47.888
<i>Bob?</i>

01:04:49.806 --> 01:04:51.516
<i>Bob, I know you're out there.</i>

01:04:53.352 --> 01:04:55.062
Bob, I know you can hear me.

01:05:02.652 --> 01:05:04.821
Bob, I really,

01:05:04.905 --> 01:05:07.699
I really need you to open
this door now, okay?

01:05:12.496 --> 01:05:14.664
You are just a builder though,
right?

01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:20.545
I know you got roped into this.

01:05:25.509 --> 01:05:28.929
You...
you've got a family, Bob.

01:05:29.721 --> 01:05:31.431
<i>We talked about them,
remember?</i>

01:05:34.267 --> 01:05:36.395
I can see them
up on this wall, they...

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.524
they look really lovely.

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:43.443
Your wife, your daughter.

01:05:50.701 --> 01:05:53.161
<i>Imagine if it was her
in here. Huh?</i>

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:10.637
Bob, I really need you
to let me out, okay?

01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:32.075
Right.

01:06:32.993 --> 01:06:34.327
The money and the bag...

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:36.621
That puts us close
to what each man's owed.

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:40.542
It's fill your boots
and split time, Dave.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:42.335
Well that split as well,
what do you want to do?

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:43.336
Four ways or five?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.504
Four.
Fuck him.

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:47.257
No, he grafted,
he earned his cash.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.759
Fuck him!

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:51.678
He worked twice
as hard as you.

01:06:53.221 --> 01:06:54.848
He gets his cut.

01:06:56.016 --> 01:06:57.726
And we need to get this place
cleaned up.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.979
Steve...

01:07:01.063 --> 01:07:03.231
Before we go to Cardiff
in the morning...

01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:04.733
Everything.

01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:06.860
Clean.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.243
What about the girl?

01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:21.291
I think we both know what
has to happen there, Dave.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:26.213
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No way.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:27.839
She's already seen the blood.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.052
She's already hatching plans.

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:35.013
If she gets to the police,

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:37.516
we're fucked.

01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:39.893
Yeah, well who?

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:41.395
Who's gonna do that?

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:47.693
We play for it.

01:07:56.535 --> 01:07:58.036
Dave.

01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:22.269
<i>Whoa, whoa, what, what?</i>

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:24.688
<i>What are you doing?
Stop! Fuck.</i>

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:52.841
You crying?

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:58.763
You Wendy.

01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:00.474
What's wrong with ya?

01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:08.564
Do you know how many favors
I had to call in

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:12.069
to keep you out of prison

01:09:12.151 --> 01:09:14.404
when you cut that kid up?

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.662
I want you to show me
some respect.

01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:30.252
What, like my dad shows you
some fucking respect?

01:09:31.379 --> 01:09:33.340
He thinks you're a mug,
Uncle Bob.

01:09:35.383 --> 01:09:37.343
He's so right!

01:09:38.553 --> 01:09:39.886
Look at ya.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.390
Look at ya!

01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:44.392
Do you know he used
to deny that you two

01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:45.810
were related at school?

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.399
Yeah, do you know
what he called ya?

01:09:53.984 --> 01:09:55.861
He calls ya The Provider.

01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:02.410
Yeah, need to borrow the van,
get some money in, hey?

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:04.745
Get a big round in
for the boys.

01:10:04.829 --> 01:10:07.666
Who you gonna call?
The Provider.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.630
He and my mum always
used to laugh about that.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.299
What happened to you, Steve?

01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:19.886
Where'd you go?

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:23.265
That little kid I used to take
to the footie, hey?

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:25.934
Jesus fuck.
Jesus Christ.

01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:27.519
You're soft as a bit of shit,
Bob!

01:10:27.602 --> 01:10:30.897
I grew up!
I grew up, Uncle Bob.

01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:32.649
I don't wanna come watch
your shitty football team

01:10:32.733 --> 01:10:34.693
getting dragged about
like an idiot.

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:40.449
Come on. Jim said
scrub the place up now.

01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:41.491
Come on.

01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:43.952
Hey, Bob,
don't forget your apron!

01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:48.248
You're a disappointment,
Steve.

01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:07.809
What you been doing?

01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:11.688
What do you want?

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.523
Just wanna come
have a little chat.

01:11:18.779 --> 01:11:20.655
Where you going, huh?
Huh?

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:56.733
He attacked her.

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:22.134
Help, Bob!

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.728
Shoot him, Uncle Bob!

01:12:35.355 --> 01:12:36.773
He's gonna kill us both,
you know it!

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:39.568
Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!

01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:44.281
Jim!

01:12:58.086 --> 01:12:59.379
Come on.

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:17.314
<i>Where have you been?
Eh?</i>

01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:18.774
<i>That's all I'm asking you
Where have you been?</i>

01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:20.108
<i>None of your fucking business.</i>

01:13:20.192 --> 01:13:21.526
<i>I've been looking
everywhere for you.</i>

01:13:22.903 --> 01:13:24.613
<i>Don't go fucking
disappearing again, Dave.</i>

01:13:24.696 --> 01:13:25.697
<i>I'm 72,
I can look after myself.</i>

01:13:25.781 --> 01:13:27.616
<i>Let me handle this.</i>

01:13:36.666 --> 01:13:37.626
What happened?

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:39.294
Where is she?

01:13:39.378 --> 01:13:40.212
Bob?

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:41.755
He attacked her.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.300
I know he's hardly the biggest
loss to man kind's gene pool,

01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:47.886
but Bob, for fuck's sake,
you skewered your own nephew!

01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:50.680
No.

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:52.307
Not me.

01:13:52.391 --> 01:13:53.725
The Russian?

01:13:56.687 --> 01:13:59.356
You check the woods,
take his car, bigger beams.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:02.025
Bob, wake up
for fuck's sake, he's dead!

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:03.151
Okay?

01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:05.696
Check the fields.

01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:07.447
I'll check the perimeter.

01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:09.157
Then we'll take the van.

01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:10.742
Beams and horns
if we find him, okay?

01:14:10.826 --> 01:14:13.495
If we don't have him in 2 hours,
we meet back here.

01:14:13.578 --> 01:14:16.289
We divvy up, we split.
Okay? Agreed?

01:14:16.873 --> 01:14:18.750
How do we know
that you are not going to

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:20.502
fuck off with that bag?

01:14:21.586 --> 01:14:23.922
Dave, fucking...

01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:26.925
If they get to a phone,
we're all fucked.

01:14:27.676 --> 01:14:29.386
This isn't a fucking game,
Dave!

01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:32.139
Move!

01:17:08.587 --> 01:17:10.130
Okay.

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:19.222
I didn't need saving.

01:17:24.603 --> 01:17:26.313
I couldn't leave you.

01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:34.529
Here, open it.

01:17:39.534 --> 01:17:42.329
I save some,
I send some.

01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:46.041
I just want a better
life for us.

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:49.795
That's Sofiya, my daughter.

01:17:51.838 --> 01:17:53.298
She's smart like you.

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:56.510
You would like her.

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:07.854
You never loved Simon?

01:18:11.233 --> 01:18:14.611
So who are you?
What do you want?

01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:26.289
I'm the same as you.

01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:36.341
What happened to Simon?

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:41.179
Please, tell me.

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:50.188
He treated them, us,
like shit.

01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:55.902
Shake a bottle long enough,
it explodes.

01:18:57.988 --> 01:19:02.075
Viktor, is he dead?

01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:10.333
Where is he?

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.335
It doesn't matter.
He is dead.

01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:15.839
Where is he?
Tell me!

01:19:15.922 --> 01:19:17.674
Under the concrete.
The cesspit.

01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:21.386
Keep him talking.

01:19:29.227 --> 01:19:31.229
I see she dropped
the dead weight.

01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:39.529
You been saving your pennies?

01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:45.702
<i>Just as well seeing how
this played out.</i>

01:19:45.786 --> 01:19:46.745
Hello.

01:19:46.828 --> 01:19:48.330
<i>Come on,</i>

01:19:50.665 --> 01:19:52.167
in the bag.

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:53.919
No.

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.546
Give me the money.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:20:00.926
I can kill you and take it,
or I can just take it.

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.261
It's your call.

01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:05.931
It's for my daughter.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.642
She won't miss it.

01:20:09.476 --> 01:20:10.435
Trust me,

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.940
best she learns that
you can't rely on family.

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:19.236
Then she can stand
on her own two feet.

01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:24.866
You were never gonna get it
to her anyway, Viktor.

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:26.368
Look at you.

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:27.911
You're fucked!

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:46.573
Police please.

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:52.162
My name is Bob Pearson.

01:23:15.412 --> 01:23:17.372
Sorry about this, old boy!

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:05.921
I can't feel my legs.

01:24:11.385 --> 01:24:13.553
You're losing too much blood.

01:24:17.557 --> 01:24:22.187
I'm sorry for Simon.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.110
I know.

01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:37.327
But you've fucked it all up.

01:24:46.294 --> 01:24:48.130
Ugh. Jesus!

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.475
Let's keep it professional.

01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:02.477
Well we're on Plan B.

01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:05.105
We've got finger prints,
passport,

01:25:05.188 --> 01:25:06.940
bank manager's never met him.

01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:08.692
Yeah, great.

01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:12.070
Eighteen months
reeling him in.

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.864
Bloody cavemen!

01:25:21.455 --> 01:25:23.957
- He saved me.
- He looks fucked.

01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:27.461
You know, Simon thought
you had a thing for him.

01:25:35.469 --> 01:25:37.095
Petty cash!

01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:38.680
Jesus!

01:27:02.055 --> 01:27:03.890
Go and get the bag.

01:27:03.974 --> 01:27:06.601
Did you think about it
when he popped the question?

01:27:06.685 --> 01:27:08.270
<i>Marrying into it?</i>

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:11.440
<i>Coffee mornings,
bringing up little captains?</i>

01:27:11.523 --> 01:27:13.316
<i>So the finger arrives
by medical courier</i>

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.318
<i>45 minutes after we do.</i>

01:27:15.402 --> 01:27:17.988
<i>Let's hope Plan B works
or we're screwed.</i>

01:27:18.071 --> 01:27:20.407
<i>Petty cash and a few quid
in the bag for 18 months</i>

01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:21.408
<i>playing the mark...</i>

01:27:21.491 --> 01:27:24.119
I'll get this to her,
I promise.

01:27:31.501 --> 01:27:33.253
A life away from all this.

01:27:40.218 --> 01:27:41.428
Amy?

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.224
Amy?

01:29:16.464 --> 01:29:21.464
