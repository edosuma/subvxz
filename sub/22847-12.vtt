00:01.127 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.713 --> 00:07.967
- Oh, that's quite unsettling.
- You're obsessed with Daisy Johnson.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.177
- Quake.
- My orders are to capture her.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.263
You iced me.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.682
Did you really think after everything
we've been through, you and me,

00:14.849 --> 00:16.976
that there was any universe
in which I left you behind?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.812
Phil Coulson is dying,
and you have to let him.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.319
- Yo-Yo!
- It's all coming true.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.614
<i>At least, the beacon
will do what it's supposed to do.</i>

00:30.865 --> 00:32.073
Run. Now!

01:55.366 --> 01:57.827
Simmons give you the all clear?
You got banged up pretty good.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.787
Yeah, no. I'm fine. I just...

02:01.247 --> 02:03.415
I feel foolish. I was so intent
on turning the beacon off,

02:03.582 --> 02:05.209
I didn't even consider
that it might be wired

02:05.376 --> 02:07.586
- to overheat and explode.
- You can't blame yourself, Fitz.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.630
General Hale's declared war on us.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.634
I'm afraid she's done something
a whole lot worse than that.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.388
The basement's sealed off,
but I sent the D.W.A.R.F.s down

02:17.596 --> 02:19.723
to analyse the area after the explosion.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.769
This one was on its way down
when the elevator stopped

02:23.978 --> 02:25.896
and opened on Level 27.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.943
Looks like your drone took a wrong turn
and went outside.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.653
Wouldn't that be nice?

02:33.445 --> 02:34.572
Unfortunately...

02:35.698 --> 02:40.911
this immense forest now exists
approximately 150 feet below us.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.831
But there are clouds and sky.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.251
Which is why its underground existence
should be very alarming.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.671
I'd say that's impossible,
but after our round trip to Tomorrowland,

02:51.005 --> 02:53.632
my threshold for preposterous
is way out of whack.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.759
Theories?

02:56.135 --> 02:58.762
This is the only transmission
received back from the basement so far.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.848
I think we're looking at what happens

03:01.015 --> 03:02.975
when three monoliths
are blown up together.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.854
They somehow blew a hole
in space-time,

03:07.938 --> 03:09.273
and that thing...

03:10.900 --> 03:14.528
that thing right there is
another dimension bleeding back

03:14.737 --> 03:16.071
into our world.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.161
So, the good news is Daisy might not be
the one responsible

03:22.369 --> 03:25.122
- for tearing the Earth apart.
- Bad news is...

03:26.373 --> 03:28.125
end of the world might have already begun.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.135
Sorry, is it too tight?

03:39.178 --> 03:40.179
No.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.931
Um. And the pain?

03:42.598 --> 03:46.810
So-so now, but sometimes,
my fingers feel like they're on fire.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.189
I'm so sorry.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.403
Daisy's getting more supplies,
so we can make you comfortable.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.155
Thank you, Jemma.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.918
I'll give you some time.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.051
You look scared, Turtleman.

04:20.678 --> 04:21.803
Of course, I am.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.392
The woman I love nearly died
in front of me.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.061
I'm not gonna die.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.105
Not yet.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.899
Well, that's good to hear.

04:39.697 --> 04:41.657
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help and...

04:50.416 --> 04:51.417
I'm sorry.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.502
I just get so angry.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.631
To make it back from that...

04:58.173 --> 05:00.259
fractured future only to watch you get...

05:02.136 --> 05:03.137
get butchered.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.347
I'll get through this...

05:06.015 --> 05:07.433
as long as I have you.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.355
You're the only world I care about.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.360
You say the word, I'll carry you
out of here and never look back.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.782
Thank you for that...

05:25.951 --> 05:27.619
but we have to stay and fight.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.581
The things I heard in the future...

05:31.290 --> 05:32.624
they're all coming true...

05:33.625 --> 05:35.210
faster than imagined.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.213
We can't leave.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.467
Okay, so...

05:42.134 --> 05:43.927
we need to find
where they keep the medication.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.013
Something for nerve pain.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.182
Whoa.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.851
"Orange scented."

05:54.813 --> 05:55.981
That's amazing!

05:59.068 --> 06:02.237
- Oh, my...
- Okay, snack time's over, Huckleberry.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.489
Simmons is waiting.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.703
It's nearly impossible
to get fresh fruits and vegetables.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.208
But, every year, for my birthday...

06:15.334 --> 06:17.669
my mum would find me a big, juicy orange.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.091
Sounds like a nice tradition.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.093
Yeah, it was.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.762
I loved the way my hands smelled after.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.144
What about you? Did you have any...

06:34.728 --> 06:37.356
- special birthday traditions growing up?
- Nope.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.024
Seriously? Nothing?

06:39.650 --> 06:42.694
Were you just... raised in a house
by sucky parents?

06:43.112 --> 06:45.322
More like an orphanage...

06:46.031 --> 06:47.574
with mean, scary nuns.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.244
Oh, I'm...

06:51.286 --> 06:53.080
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be a jerk.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.706
Really?

06:55.541 --> 06:56.542
Well, I mean...

06:57.334 --> 07:00.462
sometimes I do, because I think
it's funny, but not just then.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.005
I thought we were having a moment.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.049
Just to be clear,
you and I have never had a moment.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.636
That was just you telling me a story
about your very nice mum and an orange.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.556
Deke!

07:45.466 --> 07:47.468
<i>- It's our fears come to life.</i>
- What the hell

07:47.634 --> 07:49.845
are you talking about, Fitz? What fear?

07:50.512 --> 07:52.890
I'm still...
trying to piece it all together.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.559
But here. Watch this.

07:56.268 --> 07:59.146
It's low-res, 'cause it's all I could
salvage from one of the D.W.A.R.F.s.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.652
This can't be.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.237
Fitz?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.074
I think that when the monoliths exploded,
they tore open something

08:11.241 --> 08:14.953
that I can only describe
as a fear dimension.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.956
And it's leaking out.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.793
See these emissions here?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.839
- What do you think that is?
- I don't know, er, alien energy.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.925
The D.W.A.R.F. went offline
before I could analyse it.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.345
But whatever it is, it seems that
it can reach inside our minds.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.097
Yeah, well, it can do more than that.
That Kree almost killed Deke.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.140
Yeah, and I don't understand how,

08:36.433 --> 08:39.937
but it seems that this dimension
can take our deepest fears

08:40.102 --> 08:41.855
and it can manifest them...

08:43.106 --> 08:44.107
physically.

08:44.942 --> 08:49.947
- So, Kree warrior. Check.
- And if that is Lash, double check.

08:50.322 --> 08:54.284
- What about that forest on Level 27?
- You mean an overwhelming collection

08:54.451 --> 08:57.746
of branchy things with birds and bugs
and the floor all covered in worms?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.206
Are you kidding? That's...

08:59.581 --> 09:02.918
- that's a horror show.
- Okay, triple check.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.129
I'm gonna seal off the lower two thirds
of the Lighthouse. That's where the bulk

09:06.296 --> 09:08.006
of the phenomena is occurring,
but it's flaring out.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.551
The fact that it's reached Level 27,
as well as the supply pantry

09:10.717 --> 09:13.679
- tells me it's getting worse.
- So, how do we stop it?

09:14.429 --> 09:16.014
Okay.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.268
I have a potential fix, but...

09:20.602 --> 09:21.979
I don't know how to do it...

09:22.437 --> 09:24.982
without one of us... possibly...

09:25.899 --> 09:27.484
sacrificing ourselves.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.033
- Okay, Deke.
- Oh, no. Me? No, no. Hell, no.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.285
No, I just got here.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.287
I just got to a world
that's got ice cream

09:38.453 --> 09:41.164
and the sun and orange-scented stuff.
So, no. No, no, no.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.126
And in case any of you forgot,
I already did the heroic sacrifice thing

09:44.334 --> 09:47.004
to get you all here. So, I'm done.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.009
I'm not asking you to sacrifice yourself.
I just want to borrow your belt buckle.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.555
Oh.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.807
It creates an applied gravity field.
And I was hoping

09:58.974 --> 10:01.310
there was enough gravitonium,
with some modifications,

10:01.476 --> 10:04.730
to create a perpetual force
that can stitch together

10:04.896 --> 10:06.189
the tear in space-time.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.483
- Before it spreads. Can I?
- Yeah.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.152
Well...

10:11.069 --> 10:12.362
anything to save the world, right?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.158
Sure.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.911
As I said, there is a catch.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.124
One of us is gonna have
to carry this device down and activate it.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.459
And that person...

10:25.959 --> 10:28.629
may get sucked into another
dimension or killed

10:28.920 --> 10:30.464
by a manifestation of fear.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.426
That's a risk I'll have to take.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.895
Sorry, sir. But, no. There's no way.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.272
If that rift could spread,
then someone's got to do it.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.775
Not you. I'm sorry,
but there's only one candidate.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.653
Piper! She said a thousand times
she'll do anything for our forgiveness.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.945
Fitz, cool it.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.115
- We keep her in holding for now.
- Okay, okay. Well, then, if not her,

10:57.282 --> 10:59.910
- who?
- We need engineering, and we need medical.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.454
Yo-Yo needs Mack, and without you,
we're flying blind.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.456
- So that leaves me.
- No, that's not who I meant.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.666
We need you both. Stop it.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.209
- I'll go. I'm the specialist...
- You're forgetting I'm not

11:07.376 --> 11:09.419
- supposed to be in this timeline.
- No, okay, I can rework the problem!

11:09.586 --> 11:12.839
None of you are expendable!
I go in alone. End of discussion.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.551
Wait up. That's stupid, and you know it.
Military tactics 101,

11:16.718 --> 11:18.512
you never jeopardise a general
when a soldier can do the...

11:18.679 --> 11:21.390
You're not just a soldier.
Not anymore, like it or not.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.017
- You can't throw yourself on the grenade.
- You're doing that right now!

11:24.184 --> 11:25.936
- You have to weigh consequences.
- Wait. No, hold on.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.979
That's exac... You're doing exactly
what you're telling me

11:28.146 --> 11:30.399
not to do right now.
You're putting yourself at risk

11:30.565 --> 11:31.566
when my very existence here

11:31.733 --> 11:33.568
- is dangerous.
- I'm looking at the big picture.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.362
You're needed for the future, Daisy.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.406
The future?

11:37.948 --> 11:40.742
To lead? That's what you said me
when you iced me, right? "To lead"?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.954
- And to inspire.
- To lead what? To inspire who?

11:44.830 --> 11:47.374
- S.H.I.E.L.D.
- There is no S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.000
Coulson, there's no S.H.I.E.L.D.
Look around!

11:49.167 --> 11:50.168
- Okay, let's just keep...
- No! No, no, no.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.255
May is never gonna be full strength,
whether you'll admit it or not.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.341
Mack is seconds away from quitting
again because the love of his life,

11:56.508 --> 11:59.511
our only other strong fighter,
was literally cut to pieces.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.596
- Nobody quits.
- Piper stabbed us

12:01.763 --> 12:03.849
in the frickin' backs. And Fitz-Simmons,

12:04.099 --> 12:06.476
my God, you really want
to risk their lives again?

12:06.643 --> 12:09.104
They've been through enough!
And guess what, Coulson, that's it!

12:09.354 --> 12:12.566
- That's everybody!
- No, that's not it! There's an idea,

12:12.774 --> 12:16.319
a symbol that must continue,
no matter what. A shield.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.572
And I... I need you to...

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
I need you to...

12:24.202 --> 12:25.454
- Coulson!
- Phil! Phil!

12:25.662 --> 12:27.706
- Wait, what happened?
- Get Simmons now!

12:28.665 --> 12:29.750
Coulson!

12:45.098 --> 12:47.893
- Are the instructions clear?
- Yeah. I'm on it.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.480
Head up and outside, get some fresh air,
and check things off the to-do list.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.232
You're the only one who can do this.
You don't even exist,

12:54.399 --> 12:56.193
- but if you keep getting arrested...
- I know.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.195
Then that's it. So be careful.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.949
The rest of the team's waiting
in the control room.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.994
And I'm... um...

13:07.370 --> 13:09.414
- sorry to hear...
- Just get the goods.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.291
I'll be here when you get back.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.818
It's not good.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.033
The MRI shows necrotic tissue
branching out from the scarred areas

13:45.200 --> 13:47.202
surrounding Coulson's life-threatening...

13:47.994 --> 13:50.789
life-ending injury
to his heart and left lung.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.708
Which is why you lost your breath, sir.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.336
So, it's an infection?

13:57.504 --> 14:00.131
No... it isn't caused by infection.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.634
It isn't caused by anything
I've ever seen.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.511
It's...

14:05.095 --> 14:07.764
tissue that appears
to have been dead for several years.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.975
What can we do? Can we cure this?

14:10.767 --> 14:13.270
The tissue is already dead.
There is no cure for that.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.814
At least, not anymore.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.901
I can only surmise
that it's progressing at a rapid rate.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.444
So, what does that...

14:21.903 --> 14:23.405
- What are you...
- He's dying.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.873
You've known since Ghost Rider,
haven't you?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.254
I didn't know how to tell you...

14:40.213 --> 14:43.758
- and I didn't think I should.
- That's the deal you made?

14:44.134 --> 14:47.387
Whatever alien voodoo
was holding me together,

14:47.762 --> 14:49.180
Ghost Rider burned through it.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.224
That was the price.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.477
So, what, he gets to burn longer?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.105
I don't know...

14:57.898 --> 15:02.235
but my clock ticks faster,
and we get to fight another day.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.029
How could you...

15:06.072 --> 15:07.198
keep this from us?

15:11.745 --> 15:12.746
I'm sorry.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.415
I didn't want you trying
to find a solution

15:15.624 --> 15:17.584
- when we had bigger problems.
- We had a solution.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.294
Tess was brought back from the dead.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.881
We had a solution... right there.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.931
I didn't want to go through all that...
again.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.391
So, you just give up?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.518
You don't get to do that.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.063
You make life-and-death decisions
for us...

15:38.897 --> 15:41.983
all the time, and we're not allowed
the same courtesy?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.239
After everything?

15:49.407 --> 15:50.408
We deserved to...

15:51.826 --> 15:52.994
We deserved to know.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.921
How much more time does he have
on his clock?

16:03.463 --> 16:06.925
Um. I won't be able to tell
until I can chart its progression,

16:07.592 --> 16:09.678
but even now, he's at risk of various...

16:18.603 --> 16:22.148
At some point, sir,
your heart will just stop beating.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.327
I'm gonna go check on Daisy.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.666
You did this wrong, Phil.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.253
You put too much on her today.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.257
You should have told us.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.156
I...

17:12.240 --> 17:14.200
I can't do what you're asking of me.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.412
I can't do it.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.290
You've always been capable
of more than you imagined.

17:20.874 --> 17:21.875
No.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.422
Not without you.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.178
You found me...

17:34.012 --> 17:36.139
alone, in an alley...

17:37.682 --> 17:38.767
and...

17:39.851 --> 17:41.978
you... you gave me everything;

17:42.353 --> 17:43.980
a home, a...

17:44.898 --> 17:45.899
a belief...

17:46.816 --> 17:48.985
solid ground to stand on, but...

17:51.696 --> 17:52.947
that was all you.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.785
You are what I believe in.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.162
You believe in yourself...

18:00.455 --> 18:02.665
- and you should.
- No, if you want a symbol.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.376
You are the symbol.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.504
There's no S.H.I.E.L.D. without you.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.675
There's nothing without you.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.677
- There's...
- Come here.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.196
Bad dreams?

18:35.198 --> 18:38.576
The hydromorphone makes you drowsy,
but the sleep can be restless.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.996
Please don't dope me up more.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.670
- I need to stay clear-headed to warn Mack.
- That the pain is just beginning?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.547
He knows.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.799
And you should spare him.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.425
He's suffered enough.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.637
We've all suffered enough.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.648
No!

19:22.078 --> 19:23.079
What the hell?

19:23.454 --> 19:25.748
- The rift is expanding.
- You okay?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.753
We can't wait any longer.
We have to try and seal it now.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.131
It's getting way too dangerous in here.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.197
Seal off the main road!

20:04.162 --> 20:05.371
<i>We appreciate the call.</i>

20:08.291 --> 20:11.044
This is the first time Ms Johnson's
been sighted in months.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.464
I'm not positive it's her,
but one of my officers

20:14.631 --> 20:15.965
thought there was quite a resemblance.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.593
Well, I'd like to see any security footage
you might have on her.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.054
<i>If S.H.I.E.L.D.'s in town,
we'll find them.</i>

20:36.110 --> 20:37.612
<i>So, what can you tell me
about the man</i>

20:37.779 --> 20:39.614
that Johnson bailed out, this, er...

20:40.531 --> 20:42.951
- Deke Shaw?
- Drunk and disorderly.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.995
Not much there, there,
if you know what I mean.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.248
Hello?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.540
<i>You've reached your party's extension.</i>

20:49.707 --> 20:51.834
<i>Fiona is not available.
Please leave a...</i>

20:52.126 --> 20:53.962
Hello? Did this work?

20:54.754 --> 20:57.382
Can I talk to a person?
Or... can I talk to a real person?

20:58.758 --> 21:02.512
- This system is ridiculous.
<i>- He has no fingerprint matches,</i>

21:02.804 --> 21:05.723
no passport or driver's license.
Hell, we couldn't find

21:05.890 --> 21:09.978
- any physical history at all.
- I want to dust and examine the cell.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.565
<i>You never know what might show up.
He could lead us to Ms Johnson.</i>

21:27.870 --> 21:28.871
You in pain?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.042
Not always.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.765
Is this why we took a step back?

21:50.435 --> 21:52.395
The last thing you need
is to waste your time

21:52.562 --> 21:53.938
on another lost cause.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.817
Who I waste my time on
is for me to decide.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.362
It's not like you to just roll over.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.740
There has to be a way out of this.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.409
I've come to terms with it.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.704
I got a second chance. I made a difference

22:09.871 --> 22:12.332
in a few people's lives.
I don't want to be greedy.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.501
It's time to make space for somebody else.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.796
For Daisy.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.761
I won't be around forever,
and despite appearances to the contrary,

22:24.927 --> 22:26.054
neither will you.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.098
We need fresh blood to lead the team.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.185
It's more than a team, and you know it.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.522
- None of us are giving up on you.
- Well, great...

22:38.066 --> 22:40.735
because I have every intention
of walking back out of that basement.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.113
Just because I've made peace
with dying doesn't mean I'm in a hurry.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.913
Now, you want to help me get
into this gear Fitz has for me?

22:53.206 --> 22:54.374
It's super sexy.

23:09.806 --> 23:13.434
Okay. Take the elevator
to the basement, find the rift...

23:14.018 --> 23:16.104
turn that puppy on, put it in the rift...

23:17.021 --> 23:18.606
then get the hell out of there.

23:19.774 --> 23:23.069
- I wish it were that simple.
- You're referring to the other things

23:23.236 --> 23:26.072
that might be down there,
the things that I'm afraid of.

23:26.656 --> 23:27.740
Yeah.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.451
Along with... everyone else's fears.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.286
I wish there was another Chronicom.

23:32.537 --> 23:35.790
If Noah hadn't been killed,
I would have just sent him down there.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.876
His processor and advanced optics
would protect him from a lot

23:39.043 --> 23:40.294
of the dimension's effects.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.256
Is this to protect me
from the dimension's effects?

23:43.548 --> 23:44.966
Yeah. It's a fifty calibre.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.969
Should take down anything you run into.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.639
Okay then.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.684
Last thing.
I've had to amplify the gravitonium, so,

23:55.017 --> 23:57.812
when you turn it on,
don't get close to the rift. You could...

23:58.229 --> 23:59.981
get crushed by its gravity field or...

24:00.982 --> 24:02.483
sucked into the other dimension.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.360
Copy that.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.279
Don't get too close.

24:06.654 --> 24:07.655
Anything else?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.449
Yeah.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.701
That other thing we talked about.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.036
I want you to promise me
that you'll do that,

24:14.203 --> 24:15.955
- no matter what happens...
- No. No, no. It's not important.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.373
Especially now. It's...

24:17.874 --> 24:20.001
It's just symbolic,
it doesn't really change anything.

24:20.168 --> 24:23.629
Symbols are important.
Institutions are important.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.508
People need things to believe in, Fitz.
Especially now.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.844
People need hope.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.181
Okay.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.325
Okay, Coulson,
we have visual contact.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.493
Can you hear me?

24:53.743 --> 24:56.245
<i>- Five by five.</i>
- Same here. Loud and clear.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.207
- How you feeling?
<i>- Well, you know.</i>

25:00.666 --> 25:01.667
What are the odds

25:01.834 --> 25:04.212
there's a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
down there?

25:04.420 --> 25:06.130
<i>Shoot first,
ask questions later.</i>

25:06.631 --> 25:07.632
Copy that.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.805
<i>I'm at the basement.</i>

25:16.224 --> 25:17.225
Here we go.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.565
Coulson.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.192
Coulson!

25:30.613 --> 25:31.822
Now what?

25:32.782 --> 25:33.783
Now we wait.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.750
Daisy, do you read me?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.128
Daisy?

25:47.088 --> 25:48.339
I'll take that as a no.

25:53.511 --> 25:54.512
All right, Phil.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.781
Mr Peterson?

26:14.740 --> 26:15.741
Hello, Agent Coulson.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.495
It's time I told you
what's really going on here.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.585
Nothing to be afraid of.

26:26.794 --> 26:27.795
Got no weapons.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.673
And I like the hazmat look on you,
but I promise...

26:31.090 --> 26:32.341
the air's fine in here.

26:33.134 --> 26:34.552
You're not here to hurt me?

26:35.511 --> 26:36.887
You're gonna let me pass?

26:37.346 --> 26:38.472
Do whatever you want.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.057
Shoot me if you like.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.602
After all, you're the one
that's making this up.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.494
So, you admit you're not real.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.831
- That I created you. In my head.
- Of course.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.626
But you know there's something deeper.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.670
- And you're here to face it.
- Face my fear?

27:09.962 --> 27:12.923
How am I your fear, Phil?

27:13.966 --> 27:17.428
- No... I mean face facts.
- What facts?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.848
That this is all... in your head.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.476
Are you telling me
that I'm still in Tahiti?

27:23.643 --> 27:26.479
No, Coulson, I'm telling you
that you've never been to Tahiti.

27:27.521 --> 27:31.359
Or Malta, or Puerto Rico, or outer space,

27:31.776 --> 27:33.861
or the Framework, or the future.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.656
You're on the table, Coulson...

27:37.531 --> 27:38.699
code blue.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.288
- We can't just wait around.
- He wanted us to do just that.

27:44.455 --> 27:45.456
We hang tight.

27:45.623 --> 27:46.832
No one else can go down there.
He wouldn't know what's real...

27:46.999 --> 27:48.793
- It would make it even more dangerous.
- It would be a friendly-fire nightmare...

27:48.959 --> 27:51.337
We can't just let him die!
How do you not have a better plan?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.631
One life's better than two.
That's simple mathematics, Daisy.

27:53.798 --> 27:57.093
There are no acceptable losses.
This isn't Hydra, Leopold.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.886
- All right, calm down.
- He'll make it.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.265
Come on, sir. You can do this.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.268
Okay, Phil.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.980
Back to work.
Don't pay attention. This makes no sense.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.816
What makes more sense? You tell me.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.985
That you were brought back
from the dead after many days,

28:15.653 --> 28:19.740
your mind programmed with false memories
in a world with alternate realities

28:19.907 --> 28:22.201
and rocks that tear holes in space-time?

28:23.577 --> 28:26.747
Or that your brain is being stimulated
with electricity to revive it...

28:27.289 --> 28:30.209
and your conscience is trying
to make sense of random synapses

28:30.418 --> 28:31.794
firing off in your brain?

28:33.754 --> 28:35.715
- That's not true.
- You know it's true.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.051
Loki ran a sceptre through your heart,
and we are desperately

28:39.218 --> 28:40.386
trying to bring you back.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.179
Charge 200.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.473
But it isn't working.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.267
Clear.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.394
Negative. Asystolic.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.479
Mr Stark said anything he needs.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.611
No, no, no, no. No.
I've been through too much.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.321
I'm not gonna let this nightmare
get to me.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.489
Nightmare?

29:01.323 --> 29:02.700
This whole thing has been a dream.

29:03.617 --> 29:06.871
And every time the dream is too random
or doesn't reconcile with a memory,

29:07.037 --> 29:09.832
your mind creates a scenario
to make it work.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.959
See, now you're losing me.
What does that even mean?

29:12.126 --> 29:14.670
You really think your skull
caught on fire, Phil?

29:15.296 --> 29:17.923
Or does it hurt to have electrodes
on your scalp for this long?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.177
You think there was an alternate reality
where you were a history teacher?

29:21.469 --> 29:24.764
Or were you remembering your father...
who was a history teacher?

29:24.972 --> 29:27.433
- Okay, stop.
- You're reliving mementos of your life

29:27.808 --> 29:29.769
mixed with the dreams
you wished had come true.

29:29.935 --> 29:30.936
No, Mike.

29:33.481 --> 29:34.482
This is fear.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.526
I thought I'd come to terms with death...

29:39.069 --> 29:42.990
but this is my fear of it manifesting,
because it's harder to let go of

29:43.157 --> 29:44.533
- than I thought it would be.
- Yes.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.660
You're struggling to let go.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.996
At least now, you admit you're dying.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.874
What's the hardest part?

29:53.584 --> 29:55.002
The life I have yet to live.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.838
And that's why your mind
created this story,

29:58.631 --> 30:01.717
where you spent years doing all the things
you never got a chance to do.

30:02.927 --> 30:07.097
To vacation on a white beach
with blue water, to travel to the stars,

30:07.515 --> 30:10.226
to own your own plane,
a car that flies...

30:11.393 --> 30:12.394
your own team,

30:12.937 --> 30:13.979
to have a family...

30:14.814 --> 30:18.192
the brilliant students
you never got a chance to mentor,

30:18.776 --> 30:20.236
the daughter you never had.

30:22.446 --> 30:23.447
And above all...

30:24.824 --> 30:26.116
a chance to be a hero.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.371
You said it yourself, Coulson.

30:30.955 --> 30:34.041
- It matters who you are.
- No, I'm not trying to be a hero.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.918
I'm just here to see
that S.H.I.E.L.D. continues...

30:36.085 --> 30:37.711
Remember Daisy's words.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.505
There is no S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.758
There is nothing without you.
This is all in your head.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.760
- I refuse to believe this.
- That's your problem.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.679
You won't let reality sink in.

30:47.555 --> 30:51.267
Even now, your mind is rejecting the fact
that I'm just an EMT standing over you.

30:51.809 --> 30:54.103
It's trying to make me
into something else.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.272
It's trying to find a way out.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.069
- Aircraft incoming.
- They found us.

31:02.236 --> 31:03.612
Did Deke get caught?

31:04.488 --> 31:05.489
It's a Quinjet.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.324
<i>Repeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. 313,</i>

31:07.491 --> 31:10.119
<i>requesting permission to land.
Do you read?</i>

32:04.173 --> 32:05.883
You don't know
what those people mean to me.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.718
Don't say that they're nothing.
Don't say that.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.304
No. No, they're a reflection of you.

32:11.013 --> 32:12.181
Who you truly are.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.058
One of the good ones.

32:14.808 --> 32:15.809
The real deal.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.191
You've still got that thing there.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.778
And I'm not trying to take it
from you, I'm not trying to stop you.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.365
After all, look.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.790
You're literally walking into the light.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.418
You're ready.

32:43.963 --> 32:44.964
Let's go together.

33:01.689 --> 33:02.856
Sorry, Mike.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.025
I'm not buying it.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.697
Then I'll take you myself.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.250
What are you doing, Coulson?
Pick up the doodad. Let's go!

34:41.746 --> 34:42.748
You're...

34:43.290 --> 34:45.708
You're real, right?
Please tell me you're real.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.378
Would that make this any less awkward?

34:49.295 --> 34:50.880
- Yeah.
- Good.

34:56.428 --> 35:01.558
Prints and DNA came back, ma'am.
Deke Shaw? He's no one.

35:02.059 --> 35:05.187
As in, no record at all.
Could be a Life Model Decoy.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.523
And we're getting calls
from towns at the lakefront,

35:07.773 --> 35:09.399
more Daisy Johnson sightings.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.693
Do you want us to chase them?

35:14.655 --> 35:18.325
She's either on her way to Canada,
or this entire thing is a smokescreen.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.287
Pack it up.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.804
The gravity field's
keeping the rift contained, for now.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.598
It's a band-aid.
We'll need a more powerful solve,

35:41.765 --> 35:44.977
but... the anomalies are fading,
no new ones are occurring.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.814
We have one man to thank for that.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.441
Oh, come on. That's overstating it,

35:51.733 --> 35:53.819
but still, it means a lot coming
from you two.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.613
I mean, obviously, it was pretty touch
and go up there for a while,

35:56.822 --> 35:59.491
but I called around
to tell the Daisy Johnson story

35:59.658 --> 36:01.743
and was able to get everything off
the checklist,

36:01.910 --> 36:04.079
though no one had ever heard of Haig,

36:04.538 --> 36:06.623
so, I got something even better.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.799
But, yeah, I'm not gonna lie
I was pretty freaked out

36:16.091 --> 36:17.801
when I punched the coordinates
into the phone and it led me

36:17.968 --> 36:21.346
into the middle of a grassy field.
And it's like, "Can the Quinjet get here

36:21.513 --> 36:25.475
a little bit quicker, please," you know?
But I managed to brave the critters.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.687
Pro tip... tuck your pants
into your shoes.

36:29.730 --> 36:30.731
Nothing gets up.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.321
- I was obviously talking about Deathlok.
- Goes without saying.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.573
- Is he sticking around?
- No.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.283
He rolls solo.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.827
He stepped up,
helped some agents on the run,

36:43.994 --> 36:46.246
helped Agent Davis find medical help,

36:46.413 --> 36:48.832
but he said he's leaving
after tonight's festivities.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.001
Well, I mean, his arrival
was perfect timing.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.212
Uncanny, really.

36:53.629 --> 36:54.630
Just what we needed.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.256
Yeah.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.885
What exactly were you up
against down there, sir?

37:02.596 --> 37:03.805
Fitz, are you stalling?

37:06.391 --> 37:07.893
Me? Am I stalling? Just now?

37:09.228 --> 37:10.687
- I don't think so.
- Because...

37:11.813 --> 37:13.523
the elevator stopped, like, a minute ago.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.287
It's gonna be great.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.760
Wow. You look stunning.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.013
I'm pinned into this thing
in 30 different places.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.474
It was the only wedding dress
at the second-hand shop, apparently.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.060
He couldn't find you a kilt?

38:32.394 --> 38:34.313
Uh... No.

38:40.819 --> 38:44.197
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

38:45.198 --> 38:49.244
for a moment we all knew was coming,
some of us even before these two did,

38:49.828 --> 38:51.413
and I think we can all agree

38:51.580 --> 38:55.042
that to wait even one second
to do this... is playing with fire.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.004
- All in favour?
- Aye.

39:00.422 --> 39:01.590
The ayes have it.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.216
So, all right.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.679
Time for the exchanging
of the vows, I guess.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.683
So, you bride's side or groom's side?

39:12.601 --> 39:13.852
I know them both.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.690
I had to write it down.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.277
Fitz.

39:23.570 --> 39:26.615
I knew from the moment I saw you,
from our first conversation

39:26.782 --> 39:31.286
about dielectric polarisation,
that you'd be in my life for a long time.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.247
But I didn't know...

39:35.457 --> 39:36.875
you would be my life,

39:37.667 --> 39:38.794
my heart,

39:39.461 --> 39:40.462
my home.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.843
We joined this team for adventures,
and got more than we had hoped...

39:52.599 --> 39:54.643
but I can't wait for our next adventure...

39:55.936 --> 39:57.479
building a family together.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.067
My love for you grows deeper,
and always will...

40:03.527 --> 40:06.405
...no matter where the universe
takes us next.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.751
- So, you full cyborg, or?
- Yeah.

40:19.918 --> 40:20.919
Cool.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.171
Agent Fitz?

40:24.381 --> 40:25.757
Um...

40:26.425 --> 40:27.467
Okay, um...

40:28.051 --> 40:29.761
I have been thinking about what to say.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.304
Uh...

40:33.682 --> 40:36.393
Just... words don't really...

40:37.978 --> 40:39.104
seem enough.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.363
I think that you are perfect...

40:49.990 --> 40:50.991
...and, um...

40:54.453 --> 40:55.829
I don't deserve you, Jemma.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.458
I don't. I don't deserve you.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.129
And I'm well aware
that I'm the luckiest man...

41:05.046 --> 41:06.423
on any planet.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.638
Okay. Let's have the rings.

41:14.764 --> 41:18.059
Quickly, please,
before this forest collapses around us.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.815
Okay, Fitz, repeat after me.

41:24.774 --> 41:25.775
With this ring...

41:26.276 --> 41:28.028
- With this ring...
- ...I thee wed.

41:29.863 --> 41:30.864
...I thee wed.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.203
So, you got the rings, huh?

41:37.287 --> 41:38.288
It's a nice one.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.416
Turns out a lot of people
pawn wedding rings.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.252
I had to find one
that was gonna be small enough

41:44.419 --> 41:47.005
for his little-boy fingers.
And then, for hers...

41:47.672 --> 41:50.383
found this ring that looks just like
this one that my mum

41:50.550 --> 41:52.802
used to wear sometimes.
It was my grandma's, I think.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.392
- You got something?
- I don't know.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.020
Thinking Deke Shaw could possibly
be an LMD.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.398
I ran a genetic profile to see
if he was biologically linked to anyone.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.234
And it came up with a match?

42:08.193 --> 42:09.194
No.

42:09.778 --> 42:10.987
It came up with two.

42:16.034 --> 42:20.038
Now, by the powers vested in me by...

42:20.914 --> 42:23.083
well, by the two of you,
I am so happy

42:23.250 --> 42:24.876
to pronounce you husband and wife.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.170
You may kiss the bride.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.434
So, what about you, bride or groom?

42:42.519 --> 42:45.772
Uh. I mean, to be honest,
I don't really know either one of them.
