WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:07.877
Seizure warrant come in yet?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.358
Not yet,
but the raid's still on today.

00:10.401 --> 00:13.056
Montrose Mercs aren't
gonna know what hit 'em.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.884
Heard we're expecting to
confiscate some legit weaponry.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.146
Mercs have been
stockpiling arms,

00:16.190 --> 00:17.756
gearing up to expand
their territory.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.282
I'd prefer to stop
that plan before it starts.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.545
This isn't one of their usual
hangouts. It's a storage spot?

00:23.588 --> 00:25.677
The Mercs are
keeping it on the DL.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.637
Intel says we're looking
at two, maybe three guys

00:28.680 --> 00:30.334
on guard.
So when the warrant lands,

00:30.378 --> 00:32.554
we'll make our move.

00:33.946 --> 00:37.254
Zero tolerance for
hazing means zero tolerance.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.604
So why did you two decide
to ignore your commanders?

00:39.648 --> 00:41.302
And don't think
that it escaped my notice

00:41.345 --> 00:43.043
that it was only female
recruits that were targeted.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.916
Gentlemen, that was not
a rhetorical question.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.006
It was just a joke, sir.
Alexis--

00:50.050 --> 00:51.703
I mean, Officer Cabrera--

00:51.747 --> 00:53.444
said it didn't bother her.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.924
It really doesn't, Sergeant.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.405
I'm sure the other women
don't care, either.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.449
Well, I appreciate that, Cabrera,

00:58.493 --> 00:59.624
but seeing any cadet harassed,

00:59.668 --> 01:01.191
that bothers me.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.933
I've spoken to
your team leaders.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.239
You're both riding the bench
for a month.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.068
You're dismissed.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.598
I got to get going,
but I just want to apologize.

01:16.641 --> 01:17.599
That kind of behavior,

01:17.642 --> 01:18.948
that is not SWAT.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.123
It's not how we do things here.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.212
Thank you, sir.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.651
Cabrera?

01:26.695 --> 01:28.827
I'm fine. I mean...

01:28.871 --> 01:31.178
free tampons, right?

01:35.660 --> 01:39.534
Hey, I heard you saw Deac laying
down the law for the rookies

01:39.577 --> 01:42.014
caught stuffing tampons
in recruit lockers? <i>Female</i> recruit lockers.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.712
Everyone knows hazing
won't fly anymore.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.148
What were they thinking?

01:45.192 --> 01:46.932
That they weren't
actually hazing anyone.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.847
Anything less than forcing
people to run until they puke

01:48.891 --> 01:50.458
is considered...

01:50.501 --> 01:52.068
a joke or a bonding experience.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.244
Yeah, I never understood
how leaving potstickers

01:54.288 --> 01:56.290
in my seat
made me more of a cop.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.205
For me, it was stealing my
clothes while I was showering.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.250
And asking me to
make 'em sandwiches.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.123
It wasn't easy to think of these
people as, uh, fellow officers,

02:03.166 --> 02:04.907
trusting them
to have your back.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.952
- How'd the recruits take it?
- Most of 'em weren't in yet.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.998
Alexis Cabrera played it cool.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.608
But I'm gonna check in
with her later.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.828
Smart. Don't want
a good cadet rethinking SWAT

02:12.871 --> 02:14.743
'cause of some stupid prank.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.838
Whitlock,
I appreciate you

02:22.881 --> 02:24.753
coming over to take a look
at this for us.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.363
Yeah, it's no
problem, Commander.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.844
Uh, the IT request said that
you had some data disappear?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.672
Yeah, the armory rotation
for the next month.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.674
It was there last night, but
now the computer's erased it.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.545
Okay, and you are confident

02:34.589 --> 02:37.853
that the officer put the data
into the spreadsheet properly?

02:37.896 --> 02:40.203
Because, as it turns out,
most computer errors

02:40.247 --> 02:41.335
are, shockingly,
human errors.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.597
Yeah, I put it in.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.076
Well, he's more of
a field warrior than

02:44.120 --> 02:46.122
a keyboard one,
so feel free to check his work.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.819
- All right.
- At least this'll

02:47.863 --> 02:49.560
be more challenging
for you than our usual

02:49.604 --> 02:51.649
password reset requests.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.086
Well, I like to help out
where I can.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.697
I'll let you know if I
can recover your data.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.220
All right.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.004
Keep me updated.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.792
This part of Revelations
starts like...

03:03.835 --> 03:05.576
God is always spying.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.188
But He knows
"that you are doing more

03:08.231 --> 03:09.841
than you did at first."

03:09.885 --> 03:11.495
And that's nice. Yeah.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.584
He sees the progress
we each make every day.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.239
No matter
how small it may be.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.328
All right, fellas,
let's wrap this up.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.244
I'll, uh... keep it brief.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.507
The Lakers lost,

03:23.551 --> 03:25.640
the Kings lost,
Clippers didn't play.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.946
So let us pray that
by this time next week,

03:27.990 --> 03:29.165
things have improved.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.949
Amen.
Amen.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.212
Thanks, guys.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.257
See you. Thank you.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.172
Hey, Eduardo.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.653
Glad you joined us and feel free
to come back anytime.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.785
All right, it's good to hear it.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.440
Hey, in the meantime, I was
hoping you could do me a solid.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.834
See, my lawyer hasn't
been answering my calls.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.618
Oh, I-I can't.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.620
Look, I just want to get
- a message through to her.
- Right.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.318
Well, I'm sorry, but, you know,
I'm not supposed to know

03:51.361 --> 03:53.233
anything about your situation,
and it goes both ways.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.625
It's for everyone's
protection.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.148
Yeah, it's a little
too late for that.

03:57.324 --> 04:00.022
I already know you're a cop.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.154
That's an interesting theory.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.159
I just want to get
this letter delivered to her.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.988
And I thought maybe
you'd recognize me, too.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.295
But I guess SWAT

04:12.339 --> 04:14.079
puts bracelets
on a lot of guys, huh?

04:14.123 --> 04:16.299
I was your arresting officer?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.605
The one and only.

04:17.648 --> 04:18.910
Guess I wasn't
that memorable.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.304
So you think
that I'm the best person

04:21.348 --> 04:22.740
to ask for this favor?

04:22.784 --> 04:24.916
Sure. You owe me.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.179
How's that?
I'm innocent.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.312
Been behind bars
for six years now.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.401
And you guys put me in here
for something I didn't do.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.317
Please.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.536
I-I can't.

05:06.697 --> 05:09.526
Where are the weapons? This is
supposed to be a huge stash.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.574
We've got movement
on the right flank.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.099
There's more Mercs
than we thought.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.624
Sergeant, something's not right.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.326
Parker's hit! Get him out!

05:30.199 --> 05:32.027
You see them?
Where are they?

05:33.245 --> 05:34.856
We've been waiting
for you to show!

05:34.899 --> 05:37.989
Was worried you might not come.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.513
It's a trap, go!

05:39.556 --> 05:40.818
Go!

05:43.081 --> 05:46.215
Shots fired, shots fired!
Officer down! We need SWAT now!

05:51.438 --> 05:54.005
Tan, stick 'em.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.920
Two Gang
and Narcotics officers

05:55.964 --> 05:57.618
managed to evacuate.
We got two more inside.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.229
Maybe five or six Mercs.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.187
All right, Deac,
we're set on the two side.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.364
Chris.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.497
We're set.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.369
Infrared drone incoming.

06:09.412 --> 06:12.197
Keep eyes on the infrared
to track the officers inside.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.025
Deacon, you got the north end,
we got the south.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.636
Find those officers.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.289
Get 'em out.
We'll deal with the Mercs later.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.595
On my count. Ready?

06:18.639 --> 06:20.641
Three, two...

06:20.684 --> 06:22.773
one-- go!

06:29.606 --> 06:32.348
Cluster in
the three-four stairwell.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.132
Our guy's heading west.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.917
Drone's got
a bad connection.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.617
Well, this isn't good.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.271
Lost signal?

06:42.314 --> 06:44.447
Hold, hold.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.493
This is 20-David to Command.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.582
Infrared on our end is gone.
We need your guidance.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.627
- Commander?
- You're breaking up, Hondo!

06:50.671 --> 06:52.673
What the hell's happening?

06:54.196 --> 06:55.545
Did you do something?

06:55.589 --> 06:57.417
No.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.809
Deacon, if you can hear me,

06:58.853 --> 06:59.897
we are on our own.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.116
Roger.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.554
Hey.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.469
LAPD.
We're here
to get you out.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.992
Who are we talking
to, Officer?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.472
Detective Howard.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.995
GND.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.562
All right.
Come on, we got you.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.999
Hondo, we've got
Officer Howard.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.479
Advancing towards the exit.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.968
Tan, double back around.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.492
Street, move.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.498
Second officer and Mercs
headed your way, Tan.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.509
Don't move!

07:46.553 --> 07:47.945
I've got Anders secure.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.601
Stay down!

07:53.124 --> 07:56.301
This is 20-David,
final officer recovered.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.087
Tan,
get him out of here!

07:59.130 --> 08:00.480
Good?

08:00.523 --> 08:02.873
Yeah, I'm good.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.224
Sweep is complete.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.878
Total of six Mercs in custody.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.141
That was triple the guard
Gang and Narcotics

08:10.185 --> 08:12.317
expected to see
when they went in.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.058
And the weapons cache
they came to seize isn't here.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.017
Seems like the Mercs knew
a raid was coming.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.018
Could GND have a leak?

08:17.061 --> 08:18.715
I don't know.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.325
I don't know what happened
to the drone or the radio.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.458
Commander?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.504
I was inside the system
when the glitches started.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.853
So what's going on?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.507
There is a virus
overloading everything.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.812
Someone has invaded the system.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.553
A cyberattack?

08:33.077 --> 08:34.949
LAPD's been hacked.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.558
Cybercrime confirmed the hack?
Yeah.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.560
But since Whitlock was
already here for IT,

09:20.603 --> 09:22.562
I asked him to walk us
through the particulars.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.129
Okay. Uh, two days ago,
a virus appeared

09:25.173 --> 09:26.957
in LAPD's internal network,

09:27.001 --> 09:29.612
and as that virus spread,
it overloaded

09:29.656 --> 09:31.614
databases,
causing the glitches.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.050
Your lost data situation?

09:33.094 --> 09:34.574
You have this hacker
to thank for that.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.923
Cybercrime said he left
a signature, calls himself

09:35.966 --> 09:37.881
"Shadowboxx"-- two Xs.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.622
Or calls herself
or calls themself.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.189
It is statistically himself,
but I never want

09:41.232 --> 09:42.669
to underestimate anyone.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.235
Well, whoever this Shadowboxx
is, I'm thinking

09:44.279 --> 09:46.237
he did more than wreak havoc
on our computers.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.544
The Mercs knew about
that GND raid in advance.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
Now we learn that LAPD's
system's been compromised

09:50.633 --> 09:53.201
for 48 hours?
It all feels connected.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.029
Shadowboxx was able
to download LAPD data.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.596
They had access
to operation details,

09:56.639 --> 09:58.206
officer assignments, schematics...

09:58.249 --> 10:00.077
The hacker's the leak.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.644
Handed over
the where, when and how

10:01.688 --> 10:03.385
of the Gang and Narcotics
operation to the Mercs.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.561
How much info did this hacker
take from our system?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.998
I can't say for sure, but I
know that it's not limited

10:08.042 --> 10:10.174
to one division-- the entire
system is an open book.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.437
This ain't over.
He's a middleman.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.048
Selling stolen police intel
to criminals.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.311
GND walked right into an ambush.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.269
Next time,
Shadowboxx could publish

10:18.313 --> 10:19.923
a detective's home address,

10:19.967 --> 10:23.100
making it open season
on all cops, on duty or off.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.146
Cybercrime is working
to re-secure the network

10:25.189 --> 10:26.974
and identify Shadowboxx.
It's gonna take them

10:27.017 --> 10:28.802
a little bit of time,
but they're gonna get him.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.281
They can't just make us
stand by-- this hacker's putting

10:30.325 --> 10:31.935
every cop in the city at risk.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.676
I don't like it any more
than you do, but Shadowboxx

10:33.720 --> 10:35.547
could be on the other side
of the world.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.506
Our focus needs to be here.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.421
LAPD is halting new operations.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.423
We need to comb through
ongoing missions.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.860
Find those under the greatest
threat and secure them.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.557
Undercovers.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.559
Officers who won't be easy
to pull from the field.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.996
They may not even know
- their covers are blown.
- I know.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.780
Uh, there's one more thing!

10:50.824 --> 10:53.043
Shadowboxx is still active
inside the database.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.698
This hacker can see
everything you access.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.482
See who SWAT's looking into,
what we're planning?

10:57.526 --> 10:59.528
Which means he can sell it.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.704
Make criminals disappear
before we can even catch 'em.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.011
We don't give him
anything to see.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.187
As of this moment,

11:06.230 --> 11:07.754
SWAT is going off-line.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.458
Sergeant Hearns was successfully
pulled from her undercover op.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.416
What about Mark O'Dell? He's
embedded with the One-Niners.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.766
Let's see, O'Dell. Yeah.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.245
Confirmed he's
in a secure location.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.247
There's a team en route
to pick him up.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.728
You know, I'm struggling
to remember why Annie and I

11:25.772 --> 11:27.687
make such an effort
to limit the kids' screen time.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.993
Computers are great.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.300
Got an officer in trouble.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.519
Officer Paulo Baptista.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.957
working undercover
inside a drug trafficking ring

11:37.000 --> 11:38.567
led by Pedro Suarez.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.134
Yeah, deep cover assignment.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.570
Handler hasn't been able
to make contact,

11:41.613 --> 11:43.485
so Vice did
a soft physical check-in.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.313
Baptista's door was kicked in,
his place tossed.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.141
Neighbor reported
seeing an altercation

11:47.184 --> 11:49.012
and Baptista getting forced
into a car.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.014
Shadowboxx must've blown
Baptista's cover.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.320
Baptista has nothing
to bargain with.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.061
He's alive
to be Suarez's plaything.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.584
Well, then, we got to get
to Suarez before he gets bored.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.194
Any idea where they might
be holding him?

11:57.238 --> 11:59.501
Nah, Suarez's guys backed
out of all their usual spots,

11:59.544 --> 12:01.329
vacated their home addresses.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.113
They must know everything
that LAPD has on them.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.767
What about the car, did
the neighbors give any details?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.769
Black SUV, partial plate.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.684
Doesn't match any known vehicles
in Suarez's ring.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.033
It was probably stolen.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.513
Right now that car is
our only lead

12:11.556 --> 12:13.036
to find Officer Baptista.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.646
But we can't run the plate
on our computers.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.431
If Shadowboxx sees,
he's gonna inform Suarez.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.389
Which is not good for Baptista.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.043
Guys, LAPD isn't
the only organization

12:20.087 --> 12:21.566
with makes and models on file.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.481
Call the DMV.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.570
Back when I was a rookie,
that was practically

12:25.614 --> 12:27.877
the first assignment--
cultivate an inside man.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.966
I'm on it.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.588
Nicely done.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.677
We'll see if I can
keep the accuracy up

12:45.721 --> 12:47.462
after a speed reload.

12:47.505 --> 12:50.204
Isn't 20-Squad busy

12:50.247 --> 12:53.163
with fallout from the hack?

12:53.207 --> 12:55.339
We are, but I wanted to check in

12:55.383 --> 12:57.124
with you after the crap
those rookies pulled

12:57.167 --> 12:59.517
- in the locker room.
- Meant what I said.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.085
I'm fine.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.608
If you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.262
Or Deacon or Dr. Wendy.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.874
They stuffed my locker
as a stupid joke.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.528
It wasn't a big deal
until Sergeant came,

13:10.572 --> 13:13.357
made it one, and now
you're here making it worse.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.883
All I want to do is help.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.233
I didn't ask for that.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.499
Other officers
are watching.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.414
Please, just...

13:26.457 --> 13:28.416
back off.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.862
Hey, Deac?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.864
We any closer
to finding Officer Baptista?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.823
Uh, Street's still combing
through DMV records,

13:43.866 --> 13:45.868
working a partial plate,
it just takes more time

13:45.912 --> 13:47.391
than using our system.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.393
All thanks to this Shadowboxx,
messing with the LAPD

13:49.437 --> 13:50.873
from the safety
of God-knows-where,

13:50.917 --> 13:52.309
and we can't even
go after him.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.007
What's that?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.923
Oh, it's an old SWAT log.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.578
You ever think back
on a mission and realize

14:00.622 --> 14:03.059
that you don't remember the name
of a suspect you collared?

14:03.103 --> 14:05.105
We've made
a lot of arrests, Deac.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.933
Who's this one about?

14:06.976 --> 14:09.283
Eduardo Ortiz.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.111
He was arrested six
years ago for murdering

14:11.154 --> 14:13.156
a woman after she
denied his advances.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.897
Well, it doesn't surprise me
he didn't stick in your brain.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.943
He's not someone we chased
after on a mission.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.379
No, he's just one
of a half-dozen

14:18.422 --> 14:19.859
high-risk warrants
we served that day.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.339
It says he's still inside.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.733
Why's Ortiz coming up
- for you now?
- Well, he just got

14:24.776 --> 14:27.083
transferred to the prison where
I'm doing ministry outreach.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.956
- Mm-hmm.
- And he recognized me, came asking for help.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.958
Says he's innocent.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.437
Oh, right,
he's one of the innocent ones.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.178
No, I know, I know,
but it's...

14:35.222 --> 14:37.615
I changed his whole life

14:37.659 --> 14:39.922
and I didn't remember him
at all.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.663
All right, hold up.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.317
SWAT's just the tip of
the spear. Not judge and jury.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.232
Yeah, maybe that's the job.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.712
But I don't know.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.758
This guy, Ortiz,
he's got me wondering.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.891
Is-is that
where our responsibility ends?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.155
I'm not gonna talk you
out of digging into this.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.504
I don't even want to try.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.809
- But be careful, Deac.
- Yeah.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.594
Ortiz sought you out
for a reason,

14:59.637 --> 15:00.943
and he used an argument
that's tailor-made

15:00.987 --> 15:02.205
to mess with your head.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.083
DMV records paid off.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.650
Found the black SUV
Suarez used to abduct Baptista.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.088
Okay, William Marleza,
the car's actual owner?

15:15.131 --> 15:17.438
Yeah, he's a low-level drug
dealer, buys from Suarez.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.353
So we ID'd the car.
That still doesn't tell us

15:19.396 --> 15:20.745
where Suarez took Baptista.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.138
Well, it helps
more than you'd think.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.879
Marleza is also
a property manager.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.315
He handles
commercial real estate

15:25.359 --> 15:26.926
across the city.
These are his current buildings.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.144
That's a lot of places
to choose from, though.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.233
Yeah,
now these four

15:30.277 --> 15:31.974
currently have tenants.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.802
So probably not
where they're holding Baptista.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.586
Right. And this one's
at a busy intersection.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.067
Way too conspicuous,
too many eyes.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.677
That leaves three possibilities.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.201
He could've taken Baptista
to any one of them,

15:41.244 --> 15:42.811
and we're running
out of time.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.334
Yeah, with the system down,
we have no drones,

15:44.378 --> 15:46.684
no traffic cams.
Patrol's hands are full

15:46.728 --> 15:48.773
- 'cause of the hack.
- Okay, so we divide up the list.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.340
You guys get Chris,
I'll grab Hondo and Deac.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.646
20-Squad's hitting
the streets.
All right.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.474
Let's go.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.564
Luca said they came up empty

15:56.607 --> 15:58.174
at Marleza's
east side property.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.089
Next building on our list
is this way-- empty retail

16:00.133 --> 16:01.395
storefront,
should be an easy stroll-by

16:01.438 --> 16:02.962
to see if Suarez is around.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.702
You okay?

16:04.746 --> 16:06.487
You've been quiet.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.445
Well, you know you guys were
talking about getting hazed?

16:08.489 --> 16:10.839
You said, uh,
someone stole your clothes

16:10.882 --> 16:13.668
when you were showering.
I did the same thing once.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.974
To who?

16:15.017 --> 16:17.324
It was a recruit.
Officer named, uh,

16:17.367 --> 16:19.717
Amanda Ross. This was years ago.

16:19.761 --> 16:22.242
In Long Beach. Back then,
I just saw it as a joke.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.026
Making one of the few women
in the building walk back

16:24.070 --> 16:25.462
to her locker naked. Hilarious.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.855
Honestly, I'd forgotten about it

16:26.898 --> 16:28.248
until you said
what happened to you.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.119
It was incredibly stupid.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.252
Look, it wasn't okay, but you'd
never do anything like that now.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.601
But he did it then.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.819
Have you even apologized
to this officer?

16:34.863 --> 16:37.300
Hey, that's the SUV

16:37.344 --> 16:39.389
Suarez used to abduct Baptista.
They're here.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.348
All right,
gear up.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.094
How you feel
about me and my boys now?

16:48.137 --> 16:49.617
Rat!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.755
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

17:00.062 --> 17:02.064
LAPD! Don't move!

17:02.108 --> 17:04.501
Don't move!

17:04.545 --> 17:05.546
Baptista, you okay?

17:05.589 --> 17:06.938
Back off!

17:06.982 --> 17:09.071
Chris, back room.
I'll cover them, go.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.166
Just take it easy, man.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.690
- I said back off!
- Take it easy!

17:23.651 --> 17:25.479
Code 4.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.264
Three suspects in custody,
recovered Baptista.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.918
Semi-conscious, send an R/A.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.181
Close call.
Too close.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.618
And Shadowboxx is
still out there spilling intel.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.149
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.585
Baptista's gonna be all right.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.108
I just hate
the feeling this hacker's

17:46.152 --> 17:47.675
got us playing defense.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.329
Well, Cybercrime tells me
they stopped the virus

17:49.372 --> 17:51.331
from spreading,
which I assume is a good thing.

17:51.374 --> 17:55.335
Specifically, they've disrupted
the malware's self-replicating--

17:57.424 --> 17:59.208
Yes, they did.
It's a good thing.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.949
Uh, it's a great first step
towards getting Shadowboxx

18:00.992 --> 18:03.212
- out of LAPD's system.
- You got anything else?

18:03.256 --> 18:05.171
Okay, I know this is
Cybercrime's investigation,

18:05.214 --> 18:07.738
and I completely respect that,
but I did some digging.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.654
- And you found something?
- Yeah, hackers are constantly trying

18:10.698 --> 18:12.569
to breach
the LAPD security firewall,

18:12.613 --> 18:14.571
and the system logs
every attempt.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.573
So I searched through
those records.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.445
There is no unusual
network activity

18:18.488 --> 18:19.968
that could explain
the current breach.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.535
Then how did
Shadowboxx get inside

18:21.578 --> 18:23.319
if he never attacked
the system?

18:23.363 --> 18:25.278
I think he uploaded
the virus from a terminal

18:25.321 --> 18:27.454
that was already
attached to the network.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.847
If Shadowboxx
physically accessed one

18:29.891 --> 18:31.936
of LAPD's computers--Then he's somewhere here in L.A.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.938
Not some
- server farm in Crimea.
- Okay.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.592
Can you ID
the terminal he used?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.116
I'm just a tech, man.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.074
I gave all this
stuff to Cybercrime.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.511
- They have it.
- There's hundreds of LAPD-networked computers.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.644
We need every pair
of eyes looking.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.429
And you were smart enough
to see this. Follow it through.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.214
Unless I'm reading
you wrong?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.259
No, I'll give it a shot.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
Make it your best shot.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.351
We locate Shadowboxx, SWAT could
stop all of this at the source.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.961
Get Suarez in the box.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.573
Let's see what he knows
about our hacker.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.448
Suarez.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.494
Felony assault
on a cop.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.017
Drug trafficking.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.453
With your priors,
that's life.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.064
Good news is, if you're a cat,

19:13.108 --> 19:14.762
you still got eight more.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.025
Nice try.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.375
Nine to 12 years.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.551
Max.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
Except Officer Baptista was
embedded as part

19:23.727 --> 19:25.338
of a DEA joint task force,

19:25.381 --> 19:27.078
so there's federal charges
in the mix.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.560
You spent good money
buying up everything LAPD

19:30.604 --> 19:32.606
had on you, and you didn't
read it carefully?

19:32.649 --> 19:34.216
Maybe we can get the feds
to call you a first-timer.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.087
If you tell us something
useful about Shadowboxx.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.177
I don't even know the guy.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.135
You must've exchanged
a few words to set the price

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
for the stolen intel.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.097
I got an email.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.709
Said I had a mole problem.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.625
Came with a single page
of LAPD's file on me

19:51.668 --> 19:54.628
and a promise he had more
if I could pay.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.151
Proof of concept.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.631
That email's probably
a throwaway account.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.023
How'd you pay?

19:59.067 --> 20:01.243
- Over an app, by wire?
- No.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.853
He said he wanted cash.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.507
And he gave me a flash drive.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.466
Said electronic transfers are
too traceable.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.555
You met Shadowboxx,
in person?

20:08.598 --> 20:11.384
Barely. He picked
a crowded outdoor cafe.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.255
Dude in a black hoodie
showed up.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.388
Did the swap and disappeared.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.520
I never saw his face.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.045
That's all I got.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.917
Really.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.311
Counselor, thank you
for stopping by.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.095
Like I said on the phone,

20:27.138 --> 20:28.749
I just want to ask
a couple questions

20:28.792 --> 20:31.360
about one of your former
clients, Eduardo Ortiz.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.754
Don't tell me he's got cops
delivering his messages now.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
So you know he's been
trying to contact you?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.540
He says he hasn't got a reply.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.150
I'm a public defender
with obligations

20:39.194 --> 20:41.109
to dozens of current clients.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.459
And his letters are the same,
over and over.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.026
He claims he's innocent

20:45.069 --> 20:46.854
and then he demands
I file an appeal.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.464
And you refuse because...

20:48.508 --> 20:50.379
Because it's not an option.
He took a plea deal.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.903
The terms of which explicitly
ruled out an appeal,

20:52.947 --> 20:54.601
and he knows that.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.081
You know that a lot
of defendants feel cornered

20:57.125 --> 20:59.432
into taking a plea.
I mean, they get convinced

20:59.475 --> 21:01.912
that that's their
- only option.
- Ortiz was in and out of prison

21:01.956 --> 21:04.175
for violent felonies,
he worked for the victim,

21:04.219 --> 21:06.526
and his alibi was shaky at best.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.355
Uh, frankly, getting his charge
down to murder two and keeping

21:09.398 --> 21:11.444
a life sentence off the table
was a big win.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.055
Okay, just last question.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.927
Do you think
what he says is true?

21:16.971 --> 21:18.886
That he's innocent?

21:18.929 --> 21:21.976
You know, Ortiz always
seemed to me like a clever guy.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.586
Super personable.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.067
But I can't compromise
a client's defense

21:26.110 --> 21:27.764
wondering
about guilt or innocence.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.027
Right.
Right, that's not your job.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.116
Thank you.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.208
Hey, so I called LBPD

21:37.252 --> 21:38.949
to get in touch
with Officer Ross,

21:38.993 --> 21:40.690
apologize for what I
did back in Long Beach.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.431
How'd it go?
It didn't.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.215
My old partner told me
she left the force.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.870
Opened a surf shop.
I just...

21:46.914 --> 21:49.220
I should've reached
out a long time ago.

21:49.264 --> 21:52.354
- I can't help but wonder.
- If you were part of the reason she left?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.964
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.448
Whitlock found the terminal
that Shadowboxx used

21:59.492 --> 22:01.276
to get
into LAPD's network.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.844
It was a mobile unit
in a patrol car, 11th division.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.411
I checked into systems traffic.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.195
And a couple of days ago,

22:07.238 --> 22:10.720
the computer in that patrol car
uploaded a large file.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.418
And I take it that's unusual?

22:12.461 --> 22:14.333
I called the officers involved.
Said when they went back

22:14.376 --> 22:15.943
to their unit, they found some
guy messing with their radio,

22:15.986 --> 22:17.248
or so they thought.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.033
- Shadowboxx?
- Installing a virus.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.252
When they checked the radio
and found no outgoing calls,

22:21.296 --> 22:24.038
they... let him walk
with a warning.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.127
And by that time, Shadowboxx's
virus was already loose

22:26.170 --> 22:27.650
in LAPD's main system.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.391
And, unfortunately,
he was able to erase

22:29.435 --> 22:30.871
the patrol car's cameras.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.133
Well, he may have
erased himself digitally,

22:32.176 --> 22:33.395
but he had to touch the car.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.005
Lean on the window
or tap the keyboard

22:35.049 --> 22:36.964
a few times.
So if he was interrupted,

22:37.007 --> 22:38.792
he wouldn't have been able
to wipe everything down.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.620
So maybe we
pull a print.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.317
The tricky thing is gonna be
running that

22:42.361 --> 22:44.232
against the database
while Shadowboxx is watching.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.408
Well, he only knows
what LAPD is doing.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.932
San Francisco, Anaheim, Irvine--

22:48.976 --> 22:50.978
they all have access
to the same print library.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.241
I say we do what we used to do
when the L.A. forensics lab

22:53.284 --> 22:55.025
got backed up-- phone a friend.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.551
Kept good whiskey in my desk
just to sweeten those deals.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.640
Go find a print.
I'll see who's around

23:00.683 --> 23:02.859
to take my call and
what bottles are in my office.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.818
Oh, Whitlock?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.907
Nice job.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.913
Officer Alonso,
I wanted to apologize.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.742
I was out of line,
the way I spoke to you.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.092
Maybe.
But I know why you did it.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.311
You don't want people
thinking you're weak.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.531
I want SWAT. More than anything.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.055
Those guys can do
what they want.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.753
But if my skills speak for me,

23:26.796 --> 23:29.059
no one can say
it was favoritism.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.800
I used to think
that way, too.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.454
When I was starting out and
the jokes kept happening,

23:32.498 --> 23:35.457
I'd stay quiet and...

23:35.501 --> 23:37.459
set a new course record.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.156
When other female
recruits showed up,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.680
I wouldn't talk to them
so no one could say

23:40.723 --> 23:42.464
"girls' club."We both know

23:42.508 --> 23:44.684
women have to be more aware
of how stuff looks.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.729
That's just how it is.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.470
But I don't think
that's how it should be.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.603
Suffering in silence,
that's not progress.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.475
That's why I'm doing
things differently lately.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.477
Pointing out real problems.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.218
Real issues.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.527
Sounds less lonely.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.312
And... I'm not gonna lie.

24:04.355 --> 24:07.663
It's very cool
to have <i>the</i> Chris Alonso

24:07.707 --> 24:09.839
offering me her knowledge.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.407
<i>"The</i> Chris Alonso"?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.453
Come on.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.672
You know you're
legendary around here.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.153
Well, I don't know
about legendary.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.998
Surf shop.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.304
Hi, uh...
Uh...

24:40.348 --> 24:42.742
I'm, uh, looking
for, uh, Amanda Ross?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.352
That's me. How can I help you?

24:44.395 --> 24:45.875
Hi, it's Jim Street.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.443
From LBPD SWAT.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.706
Sure, I remember you.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.448
Um, I was hoping we might
be able to talk?

24:55.058 --> 24:57.800
Not a great time.
- Uh, peak hours.
- Okay.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.933
Uh, maybe I could stop by later?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.677
We close at 9:00.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.595
Cop buddy in San Diego ran
the print we found, got a hit.

25:09.638 --> 25:13.076
Shadowboxx is
really Blake Spencer.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.035
That's fax machine quality,
but you get the idea.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.776
Unis went by
his apartment,

25:16.819 --> 25:18.952
but he wasn't around. They'll
grab him if he returns.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.910
- And if he doesn't?
- I think I found something

25:20.954 --> 25:22.738
in Shadowboxx's file.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.697
I noticed he has
all the classic hacker

25:24.740 --> 25:26.612
- low-level priors.
- Yeah, fraud and identity theft.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.831
Exactly, so I had your San Diego
buddy run some financials.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.576
Guy opened
a credit card in the name

25:34.620 --> 25:36.665
- of every family member he's got.
- Yeah, but look.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.841
His cousin Jeremy?

25:38.885 --> 25:40.843
He started racking up
charges, two days ago.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.932
same day as the hack, all
for a company called Bolter.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.282
Electric scooter rental-- kids
leave 'em all over our block.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.284
Yeah, but Jeremy, his
cousin, lives in Vermont.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.330
Bolter scooters is
west coast only.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.724
I think Shadowboxx is stealing
his cousin's identity again.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.726
Suarez said Shadowboxx insisted

25:53.769 --> 25:55.728
they meet outdoors
and then disappeared.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.077
Scooter gets him
in and out quickly,

25:57.120 --> 25:58.687
in case the deal
goes south.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.733
Well, the last charge is
from less than an hour ago.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.083
Those scooters have a GPS chip
that tracks their location.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.475
If he's still got the scooter,

26:04.519 --> 26:05.564
the company can tell us
where he is.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.087
Call them. Get 20-Squad ready.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.741
We're getting
Shadowboxx off the street

26:08.784 --> 26:11.134
before he puts another
officer's life in danger.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.538
Scooter Shadowboxx rented
is active.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.235
It's parked right
in front of the café.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.763
26-David... we got eyes.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.026
He's at the meet.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.552
There's a copy
of the intel.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.684
First one should've worked.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.816
Relax, man, it did.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.122
Then why am I here?

26:42.165 --> 26:43.253
My boss was impressed.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.820
He's got another job for you.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.693
That's...
that's not the way I work.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.392
Cops are already
sniffing around.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.873
You tell your boss
I'm not interested.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.570
Thing about that job?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.833
The boss wasn't really <i>asking.</i>

27:00.662 --> 27:02.621
Situation's changed--
the guys he was meeting,

27:02.664 --> 27:05.188
- they're not happy.
- All right, move in, let's go.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.671
Cops! Go! Go!

27:09.715 --> 27:10.759
They're grabbing him up.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.065
Stay on Shadowboxx.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.155
We lost visual.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.373
They got him.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.683
- LAPD! Get down!
- LAPD!

27:21.727 --> 27:22.728
Come on!

27:26.079 --> 27:27.558
Got one coming your way, Hondo!

27:27.602 --> 27:28.777
Drop the gun, now.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.084
Hands behind your back!

27:34.522 --> 27:36.480
Stay down.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.663
- Here we go, here we go!
- Give me two, give me two!

27:44.706 --> 27:46.099
Go, go on two, go!

27:47.796 --> 27:49.580
SWAT! Stop!

27:49.624 --> 27:51.800
I need a black
and white ASAP!

27:51.844 --> 27:53.715
Vehicle headed towards Ventura.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.631
Silver van, partial plate--
California,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.459
zero-one-baker.
Driver's armed.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.417
Units responding,
ETA three minutes.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.115
That's three minutes too many.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.856
They're in the wind
with the hacker.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.860
Who are those guys?

28:07.903 --> 28:09.557
Whoever they are, they left
their flash drive behind.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.386
They didn't want the intel.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.475
They wanted Shadowboxx.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.961
Deac, the guys
who grabbed up Shadowboxx?

28:22.004 --> 28:23.353
They're all part
of Donnie Culatto's crew.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.268
Donnie Culatto, the crime boss?

28:25.312 --> 28:26.922
About to stand trial for murder.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.837
And the prosecution's
key witness is Janet Flynn,

28:28.881 --> 28:30.491
a rookie beat cop.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.711
Now Shadowboxx accessed
Flynn's personnel file.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.061
It's full of info Culatto could
use to threaten Flynn.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.367
Stuff on her family,
her home address...

28:37.411 --> 28:39.369
Yeah, but Culatto's crew left
the flash drive behind.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.632
They didn't what any of the info
Shadowboxx was selling.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.504
Or maybe they already had it.
A few weeks ago,

28:43.547 --> 28:45.724
Officer Flynn and her wife were
moved to an LAPD safehouse.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.551
Now the
safehouse info

28:47.595 --> 28:49.249
and schematics were
compromised in the hack.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.685
including a full list

28:50.729 --> 28:52.687
of state-of-the-art
defense protections.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.776
Okay, so Culatto buys
the safehouse plans,

28:54.820 --> 28:56.691
intending to get in
and kill Flynn.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.258
But when he looks at the plans,
he sees the camera network,

28:58.301 --> 29:00.826
geofence, the panic room.
He realizes

29:00.869 --> 29:02.523
he needs a hacker
to get inside.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.307
And based on his reputation,
Shadowboxx is the guy.

29:04.351 --> 29:07.397
'Cause Culatto knows that he
already beat LAPD security once.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.834
As soon as Shadowboxx unlocks
the safehouse,

29:08.877 --> 29:10.139
Culatto's gonna sweep in
and take Flynn out.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.315
And we need to be there now.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.536
Were you able to warn Flynn
that trouble's heading her way?

29:15.579 --> 29:17.973
Nah, Shadowboxx must already
be working with Culatto.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.888
Communications
into the safehouse

29:19.932 --> 29:21.411
- are being blocked.
- It's only a matter of time

29:21.455 --> 29:23.196
before the security
cracks completely.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.154
We'll call you as soon
as we got him secured.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.504
Nah, I'm coming with you. I'm
not gonna rely on glitchy comms.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.333
I'll set up a field outpost,
run the mission from there.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.813
You're not the only one
itching to be there

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
when Shadowboxx is
taken down.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.824
Hey, babe. Hey.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.565
What are you thinking
for dinner tonight?

29:44.608 --> 29:46.045
I don't know.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.873
Flynn's probably living it up.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.918
Of course, not for long.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.441
Type faster.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.095
Not how it works.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.882
I'm in.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.666
Shutting down security.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.842
Panic room's on the third floor.

30:00.886 --> 30:04.585
By the time Flynn realizes
it's dead, we cornered her.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.544
Let's go.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.505
Shut the door.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.864
Culatto's headed inside.
Hacker's not with them.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.648
Geofence alarm never sounded.

30:24.692 --> 30:27.347
Shadowboxx successfully
disabled the security.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.088
But he couldn't have gotten far.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.788
Hey, got company.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.532
Take care of them, then
find us a new exit plan!

30:46.670 --> 30:49.108
Get to the panic room.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.550
Got eyes on the stolen van.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.465
It's about 30 years
east of the safehouse.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.733
- One suspect down!
- Move in! Move in!

31:05.776 --> 31:08.083
30-David, heading your way.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.869
Street, take the alley!
Chris, you got the two side!

31:13.088 --> 31:14.829
Nothing's working.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.265
We have to get
out of here.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.835
Coming for you, Flynn!

31:20.879 --> 31:22.924
Luca, cover the front!
Tan, you're with me!

31:22.968 --> 31:25.448
You got it!

31:26.449 --> 31:27.842
I'm on your six.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.844
If Shadowboxx
erases his laptop,

31:29.888 --> 31:31.802
we'll have no idea
what LAPD intel he sold.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.935
We need it to know
what's compromised.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.155
Hit 'em hard and fast, then.

31:45.686 --> 31:46.905
No!

31:48.994 --> 31:50.909
They're getting away!
Block the hallway!

31:50.952 --> 31:52.606
Police!

31:52.649 --> 31:54.738
Stay down!

31:54.782 --> 31:56.610
- 20-David, we got a rabbit!
- Second suspect down!

32:08.230 --> 32:10.276
- Hands!
- Hands!

32:10.319 --> 32:12.147
Ah, hands!
Don't even think about it.

32:12.191 --> 32:13.627
LAPD's been looking for you.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.767
No!

32:25.595 --> 32:28.076
- Don't move!
- Stay behind!

32:28.120 --> 32:30.470
24-David, I've got the wife.

32:30.513 --> 32:31.993
But Culatto grabbed Flynn.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.952
He's headed for a boat.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.524
Go! Go! Go! Go!

32:41.568 --> 32:44.223
Culatto's got Flynn.
escaping over the water.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.007
Once he gets to shore,
he doesn't need a hostage.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.012
Hondo, got a ride for us.

33:11.859 --> 33:15.167
I don't have a clean shot.
I can't risk hitting Flynn.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.562
Maybe I can get a better angle.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.960
Street, now, move in!
Get me closer!

33:26.004 --> 33:28.310
Come on!

33:36.144 --> 33:38.146
Flynn, stay there!

33:45.153 --> 33:46.633
It's over!

33:46.676 --> 33:49.201
- Officer Flynn, you good?
- I am now.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.942
My wife, is she okay?

33:51.986 --> 33:54.249
We got her. She's safe.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.251
This is 20-David,
officer recovered.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.384
<i>Final suspect in custody.</i> <i>
We're Code 4.</i>

34:06.392 --> 34:09.221
Sir, heard you recovered
Shadowboxx's laptop

34:09.264 --> 34:11.136
before he could activate
his kill switch.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.660
Now LAPD can track down
every piece of intel he sold.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.314
Keep our own safe.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.316
Commander?

34:17.359 --> 34:19.405
Cybercrime is wiping
Shadowboxx's virus

34:19.448 --> 34:21.755
from LAPD's network,
and as a thank you to you guys,

34:21.798 --> 34:23.626
for everything you did today,
they started with SWAT.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.541
Your computers are clean.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.327
Ah, so we can turn
- the screens back on?
- You can.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.633
I barely remember
where the power buttons are.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.548
I don't know
who we're gonna call

34:32.592 --> 34:34.550
when you move
over to Cybercrime.

34:34.594 --> 34:36.683
I'm still just IT, sir.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.250
You can do more for LAPD.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.556
I pushed you today;
you rose to the occasion.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.298
When you push yourself,
the sky's the limit.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.908
Yeah, the city asks a lot of
SWAT, but we can't do it alone.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.345
We need guys like you
backing us up.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.129
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.784
It was really cool helping
to catch a bad guy today.

34:50.827 --> 34:54.266
When you're ready, I'm happy
to call in a recommendation.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.355
How about right now?

34:56.398 --> 34:58.052
- [chuckling]
- Okay.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.098
Just-- I need to do
one thing first.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.189
There we go.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.407
Yeah, there we go!

35:05.451 --> 35:06.582
All right!

35:06.626 --> 35:08.802
Load up. Yeah, baby!

35:08.845 --> 35:10.673
Good job, Whitlock.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.414
Thank you, sir.

35:12.458 --> 35:15.678
In that situation, I'd
use a tactical reload.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.854
Heard about the recruits
acting foolish.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.988
Cabrera and them
all right?

35:21.031 --> 35:22.990
Deacon handled it
super well.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.948
SWAT Academy is lucky
to have him.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.907
Yes, they are.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.083
But I know you
still checked in.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.041
I got eyes, Chris.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.608
You're anxious about
the new recruits,

35:32.652 --> 35:34.044
but especially
the female ones.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.179
Cabrera says I'm, uh...

35:38.223 --> 35:40.399
legendary,
like me being here

35:40.442 --> 35:42.401
means something extra.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.272
I know she meant well,
but, you know...

35:44.316 --> 35:45.795
That can be a burden, too.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.449
I get it.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.190
Sometimes it's like
I'm the only thing standing

35:49.234 --> 35:51.845
between some idiot and the
belief that women can't be SWAT.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.674
Well, I think you're gonna
have some more ammo

35:54.717 --> 35:55.979
against that tired
argument very soon.

35:56.023 --> 35:57.416
Sure hope so.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.861
Hi.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.341
Hey.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.821
Looks like you got
a pretty cool setup here.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.389
You didn't drive out
all this way

36:14.433 --> 36:16.086
to compliment my shop, Street.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.437
No, you're right, I...

36:18.480 --> 36:20.265
I didn't, um...

36:20.308 --> 36:24.225
I came here to apologize,
for what happened back in LBPD.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.619
I was an idiot.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.230
And I should've been
mature enough not to be.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.363
And, uh...

36:31.406 --> 36:33.974
I behaved badly.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.197
Stealing your clothes.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.634
Messing with your stuff.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.550
That was wrong. I was wrong.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.596
Okay.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.903
I'm sure it doesn't
mean anything really,

36:49.946 --> 36:51.731
but, um...

36:51.774 --> 36:53.515
I've been doing
some growing up

36:53.559 --> 36:55.300
over the past few years,

36:55.343 --> 36:57.171
and I just,
I realized

36:57.215 --> 36:59.913
I needed to tell you
just how sorry I am.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.178
Thank you for saying that.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.008
But I can't honestly say
that you're forgiven.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.924
No, I-I don't expect you to.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.753
I'm glad you're becoming
a better person.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.583
I-I hope it's making you
an amazing officer.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.414
But I'll never know what kind
of officer I could've become.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.290
When I looked you up,

37:29.334 --> 37:32.032
heard you left,

37:32.075 --> 37:35.601
I wondered--
well, I worried, really,

37:35.644 --> 37:39.300
that what I did might've
played a part in that.

37:42.347 --> 37:45.480
A couple catcalls and
stupid jokes didn't run me off.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.355
It was all of it.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.009
Happening all the time.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.885
What you did...
Don't flatter yourself.

37:58.928 --> 38:01.061
You were just...

38:01.104 --> 38:02.845
one of the boys

38:02.889 --> 38:05.239
going along with it.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.850
That's how I remember you.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.782
Saw in the visitor's log
Ortiz's lawyer stopped by.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.480
You find anything out?

38:28.523 --> 38:30.786
Yeah, he wants her to file an
appeal, but that can't happen

38:30.830 --> 38:32.962
because six years ago,
he pled down his sentence.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.921
He already said
he was guilty.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.749
Yeah, it's got to be hard to
be partway through your time

38:36.792 --> 38:38.403
knowing you've got years
to go, guilty or not.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.622
You know, this whole thing
could be some kind of sideshow,

38:40.666 --> 38:42.668
designed to drum up doubt
where there isn't any.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.496
I don't know why
I keep thinking about it.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.454
RHD zeroed in
on a suspect.

38:46.498 --> 38:47.890
SWAT executed
a warrant.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.023
A lawyer negotiated a deal.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.459
Judge signed off on it.
Everybody did their job.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.026
You and I know better than most

38:53.069 --> 38:54.680
how complicated
the justice system can be.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.421
But still, Deac,

38:56.464 --> 38:59.467
it all comes down to whether
or not you believe him.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.263
Hey.
Hey.

39:13.307 --> 39:16.092
So, I, uh, I went down
to Long Beach last night.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.877
I guessed as much.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.575
Part of me was
hoping that, uh...

39:20.619 --> 39:23.143
I don't know,
that everything turned out

39:23.186 --> 39:25.058
the way it was
meant to for her,

39:25.101 --> 39:27.669
that-that she found
some better calling

39:27.713 --> 39:29.802
beyond LBPD.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.412
Maybe she did,
but the point is that

39:31.456 --> 39:33.109
she didn't get
to fully choose it.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.504
What makes it worse is...

39:36.548 --> 39:38.811
I wasn't just cruel back then.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.987
I was oblivious.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.293
I didn't think
about how anything

39:43.337 --> 39:45.165
we did made her feel.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.733
I just...

39:47.776 --> 39:49.996
I mean, I-I just assumed
everything was fine

39:50.039 --> 39:51.606
because I wanted it to be fine.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.913
How-how the hell
do you fix that?

39:53.956 --> 39:56.176
The past? You can't.

39:56.219 --> 39:57.917
I've had to learn that.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.877
But you faced a mistake,
honestly and completely.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.575
Now you be better.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.238
Eduardo, your lawyer's
not exaggerating

40:15.282 --> 40:19.155
when she says that your plea
is a big obstacle.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.853
There's-there's not
much she can do.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.289
But you believe me?

40:22.332 --> 40:23.943
I believe you were
in a tough spot.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.467
Yeah. I also believe
that you manipulated me.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.079
When you realized
that I lead this Bible group,

40:30.123 --> 40:32.473
you picked a moment
to approach me,

40:32.517 --> 40:35.128
play on our history together.

40:35.171 --> 40:37.347
You wanted me to go look

40:37.391 --> 40:39.872
- at your old case file.
- Hmm.

40:39.915 --> 40:42.744
Well, I wanted to see
what kind of man you are.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.746
- Now I know.
- What kind of man am I?

40:44.790 --> 40:46.748
A moral one.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.229
You could have let
the sleeping dogs lie.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.361
But you didn't.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.453
I'm not sure I could
really help you, either.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.152
And I'm not convinced
you're telling the truth.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.199
Right now, what I can offer you
is the chance to pray together.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.420
Yeah, I'd like that.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.382
May I?

41:12.426 --> 41:14.472
Of course.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.127
Dear Lord,

41:18.171 --> 41:21.000
I pray for your forgiveness.

41:21.043 --> 41:24.438
I pray for the safety and
protection of my family.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.050
I pray for Sergeant
Kay's family.

41:28.094 --> 41:31.967
And Sergeant Kay,
in his wisdom,

41:32.011 --> 41:34.100
I pray that he comes
to know that I am here

41:34.143 --> 41:36.755
because of an injustice.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.540
And that he, a just man,

41:39.584 --> 41:42.108
will be moved
to do something about it.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.503
Amen.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.680
Amen.
