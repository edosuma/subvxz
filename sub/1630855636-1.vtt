WEBVTT

00:49.633 --> 00:50.801
Fore!

00:57.766 --> 00:59.142
Let's go, Marcie.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.894
I've got to get in some practice

01:00.978 --> 01:03.730
if I'm going to win
our school's golf tournament.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.399
I'll be right there, sir.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.213
It's a good day for some practice, sir.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.592
Looks like you have some fans.

01:31.675 --> 01:36.138
If they're looking to learn about golf,
they've come to the right place.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.143
If she can't read the greens,
I don't like her chances.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.730
It's who you have on the bag that matters.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.649
With Marcie on her side, she'll be fine.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.029
Bend at your waist, sir.
You look like a duck.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.573
Blunt, but honest.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.789
See? Good caddie, good game.

02:35.822 --> 02:39.409
That kid with the big nose
is going to be tough to beat.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.411
Don't let him get to you, sir.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.916
If you want to win the qualifying match
and have a chance to play in the big game,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.585
you need to keep your head clear.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.712
That's why you're my caddie, Marcie.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.297
You keep me on track.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.842
Perhaps you should practice
your bunker game.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.764
Championships can be won
or lost in the sand.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.729
Try to carry the sand
where you want the ball to go.

03:08.272 --> 03:12.317
"Try to carry the sand"?
That's never going to work.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.785
Good call, Marcie.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.886
Behold,
the Pinecrest Elementary School Cup.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.722
Check out the past champions.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.558
"Bunker Billie, Driver Davey."

03:44.641 --> 03:47.895
And soon, "Peppermint Patty"
will be on that cup.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.190
I don't see any mention of the caddies.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.734
Why would they mention the caddies?

03:53.817 --> 03:57.196
May I remind you, sir,
golf is a team sport.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.450
It sure is. Me, myself and I.

04:02.075 --> 04:07.289
Maybe you, yourself and you can carry
your own bag from now on, sir.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.542
Stop calling me sir.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.504
President coming through.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.339
Sign this, Mr. President.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.757
Juice box, Mr. President?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.634
Smile for the school newspaper!

04:21.428 --> 04:22.930
My fellow students,

04:23.013 --> 04:26.475
as my term as your class president
is coming to a close,

04:26.558 --> 04:30.562
I am here to remind you to vote
in the upcoming student council election.

04:30.646 --> 04:35.025
Yes, don't forget to vote for yours truly,

04:35.108 --> 04:38.362
-because I just threw my hat in the ring.
-Hey!

04:39.488 --> 04:40.864
I'm running too.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.868
My campaign is
"Cleanliness is Friendliness."

04:44.952 --> 04:46.036
What?

04:46.119 --> 04:49.748
Politics is about defying expectations.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.875
You like to help people.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.752
You definitely helped me on the green.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.755
I think you'd make a great president.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.590
Me? President?

05:00.384 --> 05:02.678
I like having time to myself.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.223
If I were president,
I'd never have a moment of peace.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.393
Hello?

05:11.186 --> 05:13.564
I'd always be surrounded by people.

05:14.147 --> 05:18.110
I'd have to give big speeches
in front of huge crowds.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.778
Over here, Marcie.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.406
And I'd have to make snap decisions

05:22.489 --> 05:24.783
without anytime to formulate my thoughts.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.243
Enough!

05:29.830 --> 05:33.208
I can't imagine anything worse
than being president.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.543
No, thank you.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.295
I guess that makes sense.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.589
You once told me you were an invertebrate.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.133
I think you mean "introvert," sir.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.509
That's the one.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.268
Okay, Marcie, I get your point,

05:51.351 --> 05:55.731
but if I don't use the driver
on the fifth hole, I--

05:55.814 --> 05:58.358
Hey! What's going on here?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.194
Didn't you hear?

06:00.277 --> 06:03.238
The cafeteria
finally started serving pizza.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.741
Pizza? My favorite.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.159
Let's go!

06:11.330 --> 06:12.331
After you.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.005
There you are, Marcie.
I'll save you a seat.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.800
What do you mean they ran out of pizza?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.763
All that's left are bologna sandwiches?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.073
What?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.962
Here, let me help you, ma'am.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.088
Thank you.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.674
Why are the hallways so crowded today?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.927
There's repair work being done
in the west hallway,

07:07.010 --> 07:09.429
and everyone's been rerouted.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.890
The name's Carlin, by the way.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.767
Nice to meet you, Carlin.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.104
Didn't I see you watching the golfers
practicing yesterday?

07:17.187 --> 07:22.985
To be honest, I was studying the caddies.
Especially you.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.820
Do you play much?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.866
No, I lean more into
the challenge of problem-solving,

07:29.366 --> 07:33.412
and golf is one of those games
that with every shot and every lie,

07:33.954 --> 07:36.623
there are challenges that require
a solution.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.876
I just love it.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.545
Speaking of challenges,

07:41.628 --> 07:44.840
it looks like we're all having trouble
playing through.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.053
I guess we're going to be late.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.599
Such is the fate of the lowerclassmen.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.143
"Once more unto the breach!"

07:59.646 --> 08:02.065
It was nice talking with you, ma'am.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.871
Sorry.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.001
Italy? I know this.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.213
It's the country that looks like a boot.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.089
Here it is.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.429
Stop that right now, you blockhead!

08:33.429 --> 08:35.599
That screeching!

08:36.433 --> 08:39.269
It's all in the way
he's holding the chalk.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.105
I should go help.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.109
I can't do that in front of everyone.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.696
Better if I wait and show him after class.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.535
Someone needs to show him
what he's doing wrong.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.911
Right now!

09:01.917 --> 09:04.711
-What is she doing?
-Why is Marcie up there?

09:06.338 --> 09:07.965
What am I doing up here?

09:09.299 --> 09:12.761
I just came up to sharpen my pencil.

09:14.304 --> 09:19.101
That is correct.
I did forget my pencil at my desk.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.310
Never mind.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.915
You should have seen what those poor
kids have to go through in the hallway.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.335
They can barely take a step
without getting knocked over.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.090
And how come there isn't enough pizza
to go around?

09:50.174 --> 09:54.178
Someone has to do something, but who?

09:57.681 --> 09:59.516
Why not me?

10:08.984 --> 10:13.197
The problem is, too many students
are using the same hallway

10:13.280 --> 10:14.615
at the same time.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.952
If the traffic flow could be directedâ€¦

10:20.329 --> 10:25.334
it would be a less chaotic
and safer situation for everyone.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.711
Speaking of direction,

10:28.212 --> 10:32.174
perhaps everyone's looking at
the pizza shortage from the wrong one.

10:32.841 --> 10:37.679
I just need to look at it
from a different angle.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.317
This is sure to work.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.241
Hey. You made it.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.789
Excuse me.
I need to talk to the lunch lady.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.500
-I think I figured out--
-No buttinskies!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.001
Of course.

11:08.919 --> 11:12.005
-Do you mind if I--
-No butts, no cuts, no coconuts!

11:16.218 --> 11:18.387
I'll just wait my turn.

11:22.266 --> 11:25.477
That's it, folks.
They're all out of pizza.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.540
Okay, everyone. Stand by. I have a plan.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.210
Time to give everyone a little direction.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.217
-Hey!
-Watch where you're going.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.803
-Who does she think she is?
-Do you mind? Hey!

11:59.887 --> 12:00.929
Look out!

12:05.976 --> 12:08.645
I guess school's a bit tougher than golf.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.689
Better luck next time.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.917
Lucy for president.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.835
Here, have a button.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.171
Excuse me, Lucille.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.341
-I have a problem I'd like to discuss.
-Just a sec.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.137
Five cents, please.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.266
Now, tell me what's on your mind.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.852
I want to learn how to do what you do.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.273
Dealing with new people,
pushing yourself into crowds.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.442
I don't like doing those things,

12:55.526 --> 12:59.238
and I'm worried it's keeping me from
accomplishing what I want to do.

13:00.822 --> 13:01.823
Yes.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.284
So what you're saying is,

13:04.368 --> 13:07.996
you wanna be exactly like me.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.875
-Is it too late to get my nickel back?
-We should role-play.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.419
I'll pretend to be you, and you be me.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.630
Now, come sit here.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.676
Straighter. I have very good posture.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.052
Glasses, please.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.307
Remember, I'm you.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.520
Gee, Lucy, you're so smart.

13:31.603 --> 13:35.399
Can you really help me be more like you?

13:39.236 --> 13:45.784
Tell me that if I want to make
a bold impression, I should speak up.

13:45.868 --> 13:46.869
Excuse me?

13:46.952 --> 13:48.745
Tell me to speak up!

13:49.955 --> 13:52.082
You should speak up?

13:54.585 --> 13:58.297
I'm afraid this may require
a series of sessions.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.924
Is this time usually good for you?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.259
Timeâ€¦

14:03.177 --> 14:04.761
It's the qualifying game.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.931
I hope you have a lot of nickels.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.226
On the first tee, Peppermint Patty.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.394
Hello, sir.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.980
Hey, Marcie. What do you like here?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.231
A 5-iron?

14:16.315 --> 14:20.485
Actually, with the wind at your back,
I like a 6-iron.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.946
Great idea, Marcie.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.369
On to 16th.

14:38.504 --> 14:41.006
It all comes down to the 18th hole,

14:41.089 --> 14:42.633
and we're all tied up.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.891
Rats!

14:57.648 --> 15:01.276
That kid with the big nose is here,
scoping out the competition.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.278
Well, I'll show him.

15:03.362 --> 15:06.323
I land on the green,
and I can make an eagle.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.534
You only have to win by a stroke.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.495
I suggest you go for a safe lay-up shot.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.344
All right!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.554
Nice work, sir.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.852
It's late in the day,

15:34.935 --> 15:38.730
which means the grass has grown
just enough to slow down the putt.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.441
Aim over there, sir.

15:53.954 --> 15:58.250
Hooray! We're going to the championship!

15:58.333 --> 15:59.960
Congratulations, sir.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.796
-What a shot.
-Great game.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.049
As class president,
at least for a little while longer,

16:06.133 --> 16:10.137
I want to congratulate our winner,
Peppermint Patty.

16:10.220 --> 16:14.766
She's on her way to the big one,
the Pinecrest Elementary School Cup.

16:14.850 --> 16:15.934
One for the paper.

16:16.435 --> 16:20.939
And of course, behind every great golfer
is a great caddie.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.691
Congratulations, Marcie.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.568
-Way to go, Marcie.
-Great work, Marcie.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.904
Why don't you tell the crowd
how you got this far?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.488
Right now?

16:29.615 --> 16:33.869
Well, I haven't really had the time
to prepare anything.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.708
Speak up. Exactly like me.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.793
I have very good posture.

16:41.877 --> 16:42.920
Speak up!

16:43.003 --> 16:47.049
Golf is a game

16:47.132 --> 16:50.093
with golf balls and the caddie,

16:50.177 --> 16:55.974
and I'm sure Patricia
can field all your questions.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.368
Hello, Charles.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.453
Hello, Marcie.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.414
May I ask you a question?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.333
What's on your mind?

17:22.166 --> 17:26.713
I was wondering if there's anything about
yourself that you would want to change.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.803
How much time do you have?

17:39.935 --> 17:42.813
There's a lot of people out there
that could use a hand,

17:43.355 --> 17:44.773
and I want to help them.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.862
But when I try to,

17:49.945 --> 17:54.157
I suddenly find myself surrounded by
all these other new people.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.747
And I never get the time
to get my thoughts together,

18:00.831 --> 18:04.001
and all I want to do is run away.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.590
How can I help anyone if I can't even
stick around to say anything?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.594
How can I change?

18:13.677 --> 18:16.430
How can I be different?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.474
I wish I could help you.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.811
I have a hard enough time
just trying to be myself.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.040
"Be myself."

18:45.876 --> 18:49.796
You know, you can be pretty inspiring
when you want to be, Charles.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.881
Thank you.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.259
Me? Inspiring?

18:57.763 --> 19:00.807
Hey, pal,
looking for a little inspiration?

19:00.891 --> 19:03.602
Well, you've come to the right place.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.196
I can't believe it.
I got a slice of pizza.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.992
Congratulations on getting more pizza
for the school, Franklin.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.370
-Always believed in you, Mr. President.
-Smile for the--

19:22.246 --> 19:25.541
I'm happy about it too,
but I can't take the credit.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.961
If it wasn't you, then who?

19:32.798 --> 19:34.550
Pardon me for snooping,

19:34.633 --> 19:38.220
but it seems you volunteered
for cafeteria duty this morning

19:38.303 --> 19:42.516
and helped them slice the pizza
into eight instead of six

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
so there'd be more to go around.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.271
Smart move, ma'am.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.074
Par four!

20:01.618 --> 20:03.662
May I be excused early, ma'am?

20:10.669 --> 20:12.546
Time to get to work.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.902
There!

20:45.329 --> 20:48.749
On the one hand, it's technically litter.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.543
On the other hand, it's really helpful.

20:51.627 --> 20:54.254
We're going to get to class on time.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.840
Our tardy streak is over.

20:56.924 --> 21:00.093
I never thought
we would live to see the day.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.304
Your work again, ma'am?

21:03.138 --> 21:04.139
Great job.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.605
My turn again?

21:14.233 --> 21:16.610
Here comes the chalk screecher.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.403
This is for you, Charles.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.325
The fastball grip you have
on the chalk isn't working.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.160
Try your curveball grip.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.162
Worth a shot.

21:35.254 --> 21:37.631
It's a miracle.

21:45.639 --> 21:49.142
Don't forget to vote
in the student council election.

21:49.226 --> 21:50.519
Polls close at noon.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.607
Everyone's in a pretty good mood today.

21:55.691 --> 21:56.900
They are, sir.

21:56.984 --> 22:00.696
Must be all the excitement about
the championship match this afternoon.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.364
You're going to do great.

22:02.447 --> 22:07.327
Can you imagine winning the tournament
with the whole school watching?

22:07.411 --> 22:09.162
The whole school?

22:10.330 --> 22:13.041
I'm just happy to walk
the links with you, sir.

22:15.085 --> 22:18.547
Excuse me, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.091
The vote is officially in
for our class president.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.302
The duly elected winner isâ€¦

22:24.303 --> 22:25.637
Marcie!

22:26.346 --> 22:27.598
Excuse me?

22:31.351 --> 22:34.646
Nice work, Marcie.
I didn't even know you were running.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.608
-I wasn't. I'm not.
-You have an appointment in an hour.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.027
-Here are some papers to sign.
-Juice box, Madam President?

22:40.110 --> 22:41.737
-What?
-Smile!

22:41.820 --> 22:43.614
How did this happen?

22:43.697 --> 22:44.865
Everyone's been impressed

22:44.948 --> 22:47.159
with the improvements
you've been making to the school.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.411
Looks like we had a lot of write-in votes.

22:49.494 --> 22:53.123
-Wow, class president.
-Aren't you excited?

22:56.627 --> 22:58.837
Going new places.

22:58.921 --> 23:00.339
Meeting new people.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.510
You get to be the one leading the parades!

23:15.604 --> 23:20.567
And when I win the final match,
you'll get to give your first big speech.

23:20.651 --> 23:21.652
Marcie!

23:21.735 --> 23:23.987
In front of a whole crowd of people.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.073
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.408
-Lucky you.
-Marcie.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.166
Wow. She's so excited.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.418
Let the world know, Marcie!

23:42.589 --> 23:44.758
This isn't what I wanted at all.

23:48.971 --> 23:49.972
It's okay.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.559
I can't be president
if I never leave this room.

23:56.812 --> 24:00.232
I'm staying here forever.

24:01.984 --> 24:06.154
Welcome to the Pinecrest
Elementary School Championship finals.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.244
Where's Marcie?

24:12.911 --> 24:14.663
It's not like her to be late.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.291
I'm going to need a backup caddie.

24:19.585 --> 24:21.461
Hey, Chuck. You busy?

24:22.254 --> 24:23.255
I--

24:23.338 --> 24:26.258
You are now. Here.
I need you to be my caddie.

24:26.341 --> 24:29.344
I don't really know anything about golf.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.347
Just carry my bag
and keep the clubs clean.

24:32.431 --> 24:35.184
Marcie will be here any minute.

24:42.608 --> 24:44.318
All right, I'm set.

24:45.277 --> 24:47.321
I never have to leave this room.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.698
Not for any reason at all.

24:55.787 --> 24:56.788
This one looks nice.

24:57.831 --> 25:00.292
This is a putter, Chuck.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.961
You can't use a putter to tee off.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.130
That's pretty basic stuff.

25:05.214 --> 25:07.382
I told you I don't know much about golf.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.594
I was hoping you were just being humble.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.515
My track record of success
doesn't require much humbleness.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.226
Where's Marcie?

25:22.564 --> 25:24.900
Golf is such a strange sport.

25:24.983 --> 25:30.155
Tiny ball, tiny hole, giant field.
It just doesn't add up.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.449
A 9-iron?

25:32.533 --> 25:34.868
Chuck, I asked for the six.

25:34.952 --> 25:37.246
They look exactly the same to me.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.563
I'm worried, Chuck.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.106
About losing?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.901
Sure. That kid with the big nose
is on another level.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.070
But I'm also worried about Marcie.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.905
She never misses a game.

26:11.989 --> 26:13.490
What if something's wrong?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.702
She'll be fine without me.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.996
No one plays better than Patricia.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.292
You don't need my help.
You can win this, sir.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.836
The wind is picking up.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.839
What should my next move be, Chuck?

26:29.798 --> 26:33.760
Well, if golf is anything like baseball,

26:33.844 --> 26:37.472
I'd say there's the flag.
Aim for home plate.

26:46.356 --> 26:47.858
She's losing.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.651
-Not possible.
-Not Peppermint Patty.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.030
Hey, everyone!

26:53.113 --> 26:55.407
The championship match!

26:55.490 --> 26:57.910
Peppermint Patty's going to lose the game.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.287
-Let's go.
-I have to see this with my own eyes.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.175
How's your day going?

27:14.259 --> 27:15.928
Don't ask me about mine.

27:24.645 --> 27:25.646
Carlin?

27:28.398 --> 27:30.943
Shouldn't you be at the Pinecrest Cup?

27:31.026 --> 27:32.861
That's why I'm here, ma'am.

27:32.945 --> 27:36.448
Peppermint Patty is going to lose
the championship.

27:36.532 --> 27:37.783
That's not possible.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.034
Who's her caddie?

27:41.328 --> 27:42.496
Fore!

27:44.831 --> 27:46.750
Good grief.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.044
She could really use you today.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.964
I want to caddie for Patricia.

27:52.589 --> 27:53.674
I really do.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.926
But I'm class president now.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.178
And if I show up,

27:58.262 --> 28:03.350
I'm going to have to get up in front
of everyone and make a big speech.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.352
And I don't know what to say.

28:05.435 --> 28:10.649
From now on, it's going to be, "rush,
push, pull, don't think, talk."

28:10.732 --> 28:14.987
It makes me feel like I'm drowning,
like I can't catch my breath.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.738
I want to help Patricia.

28:16.822 --> 28:18.115
I really do.

28:19.116 --> 28:19.950
Butâ€¦

28:21.493 --> 28:22.786
I can't go out there.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.376
Tell me,
what advice would a caddie give someone

28:29.459 --> 28:32.296
that is lying at the bottom
of a 4-inch rough?

28:35.549 --> 28:39.636
I'd say,
"Focus on the shot that's given to you.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.096
Play to your strengths."

28:41.638 --> 28:43.599
What are your strengths, ma'am?

28:44.516 --> 28:47.936
Running away when things get overwhelming?

28:51.273 --> 28:54.818
Remember what you said to me
when I asked if you play golf?

28:56.737 --> 29:02.367
I said that it was more interesting
to observe the challenges

29:02.451 --> 29:05.454
and discover solutions
than it was to play.

29:05.537 --> 29:11.001
See, I think people like you are the glue
that holds things together.

29:11.627 --> 29:16.965
You all work quietly in the background to
make sure that everything runs smoothly.

29:17.049 --> 29:19.593
The world would fall apart without you.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.972
It takes a lot of strength
to carry that responsibility.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.059
I don't feel very strong.

29:29.895 --> 29:32.064
I just don't know what I should do.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.694
It's your call, ma'am.

29:55.963 --> 29:58.131
When did he get a golf cart?

30:07.975 --> 30:11.979
Just give me any old club, Chuck.
It doesn't matter anymore.

30:13.063 --> 30:16.525
Not that one, Charles.
Give her the 5-iron.

30:17.693 --> 30:18.694
Marcie!

30:20.070 --> 30:22.322
Sorry I wasn't here sooner, sir.

30:22.823 --> 30:25.450
If it's not too late, I'd like to help.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.703
Oh, boy, would I ever like that.

30:27.786 --> 30:29.496
Charles, do you mind?

30:30.289 --> 30:31.623
I thought you'd never ask.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.334
Let's win this game, sir.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.261
Pay no attention to the score.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.929
Just keep your head down.

31:20.339 --> 31:23.717
Remember, plan for the best miss.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.560
Let the big dog speak, sir.

31:50.911 --> 31:51.912
This is it, sir.

31:52.621 --> 31:53.747
The 18th hole.

31:54.248 --> 31:56.750
If you can make this in two strokes,

31:57.501 --> 31:58.919
the cup is yours.

32:20.607 --> 32:21.775
Now what?

32:22.818 --> 32:23.861
What's the point?

32:24.444 --> 32:26.238
I'll never make it from there.

32:26.321 --> 32:27.698
Yes, you will, sir.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.366
Don't give up now.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.871
Remember our practice from a few days ago?

32:35.038 --> 32:38.542
"Carry the sand." Oh, yeah.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.456
Well played, sir.

33:17.539 --> 33:20.501
Thanks, Marcie.
I couldn't have done it without you.

33:22.002 --> 33:25.422
Madam President, are you prepared
for your first big speech?

33:25.506 --> 33:27.216
-What are you going to say?
-Juice box?

33:27.299 --> 33:28.509
Say cheese.

33:30.052 --> 33:33.889
Listen, Marcie. You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.648
Actually, sir, I do want to.

33:43.148 --> 33:46.693
I just need a few moments alone
to collect my thoughts.

33:50.072 --> 33:53.116
You heard her, everyone.
Give her some space.

33:55.077 --> 33:56.787
See you at the stage, Marcie.

34:08.590 --> 34:12.469
Now it's time for our new class president
to say a few words.

34:13.887 --> 34:16.931
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie!

34:31.112 --> 34:33.739
For my first act as class president,

34:34.241 --> 34:38.203
I want to say congratulations
to my friend Patricia.

34:41.623 --> 34:46.253
For my second act as class president,
I'd like to announce thatâ€¦

34:48.755 --> 34:50.924
I'm resigning as class president.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.010
-What?
-Can she even do that?

34:53.552 --> 34:56.221
Helping people is important to me,

34:57.014 --> 34:59.391
but I want to do it in my way.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.810
I like being in the background.

35:01.894 --> 35:04.313
That's just the kind of person I am,

35:04.980 --> 35:06.356
and I like that person.

35:07.524 --> 35:11.570
There was a time when I thought
that if I wanted to help,

35:11.653 --> 35:13.530
I needed to change who I was.

35:13.614 --> 35:17.451
But thanks to some good advice
and inspiration from my friendsâ€¦

35:18.035 --> 35:19.995
She's talking about me.

35:20.078 --> 35:23.832
â€¦I've learned that I can find my own way
to do things.

35:24.917 --> 35:27.169
The world needs all kinds of people.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.880
So whether you're a natural leader,

35:30.422 --> 35:32.132
or willing to get your hands dirty,

35:33.091 --> 35:35.677
or never give up despite the odds,

35:36.595 --> 35:39.473
or even try your best
to stay out of the spotlight,

35:40.057 --> 35:42.518
all of us can make a real difference.

35:48.774 --> 35:51.985
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie!

35:59.326 --> 36:01.578
You're pretty brave, Marcie.

36:01.662 --> 36:04.039
Thank you, sir. I'm glad I did that.

36:04.540 --> 36:06.792
And I'm glad I don't have to do it again.

36:07.709 --> 36:11.213
I hope that kid with the big nose
isn't taking my win too hard.

36:11.839 --> 36:13.590
He sure hates losing.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.054
Yay!

36:34.027 --> 36:36.530
Can you believe Pigpen came in second?

36:36.613 --> 36:38.657
Who on earth voted for Pigpen?

36:40.325 --> 36:42.744
I just thought he ran a clean campaign.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.791
My fellow students,

36:47.875 --> 36:51.336
it is said that the key
to a great democracy

36:51.420 --> 36:53.714
is a great suggestion box.

36:55.799 --> 36:59.261
Suggestion box, huh?
I'll bet that was your idea.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.680
-Nice work.
-Thank you, sir.

37:01.763 --> 37:04.183
I've got a lot more where that came from.

37:04.266 --> 37:05.893
I'm sure you do.

37:05.976 --> 37:08.604
Well, I'm off to my pickup game.

37:08.687 --> 37:10.480
See you in class, Marcie.

37:10.564 --> 37:13.400
Don't forget to follow through
on your jump shot, sir.

37:13.483 --> 37:16.236
Thanks, Marcie. And don't call me sir.
