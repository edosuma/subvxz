GYMNASIUM

01:00.810 --> 01:01.978
<i>Go.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.251
<i>I always</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:28.171
<i>feel satisfied with a moderate distance</i>

01:28.254 --> 01:30.131
<i>in a relationship.</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:31.883
What? You get to dance with girls?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.260
I should have taken that class.

01:35.011 --> 01:38.097
Look at all those guys without partners.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.058
They're all guys like you.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.531
He seems to have a crush on Na-bi.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.243
I bet he'll ask her out
on the last day of class.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
Let's go.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.044
We didn't make any mistakes!
I did good, right? Did you see?

02:08.128 --> 02:11.339
We're getting an A+ for sure. Let's go!

02:25.937 --> 02:27.313
You danced pretty well.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.859
-Did you see?
-Yes. I saw it when I was passing by.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.029
I knew you'd be a good dancer.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.365
I never stepped on my partner's foot.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.326
-Thanks.
-Is that it?

02:40.910 --> 02:42.162
I'll buy you a meal.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.038
All right.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.794
Did you stay up all night?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.380
You're overworking yourself.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.716
I've gotten a grip on myself
thanks to you.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.968
You told me to be sincere.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.931
I was only talking about dating.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.977
I tried applying lacquer on glass,
but I screwed up.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.771
It just keeps falling off.

03:10.106 --> 03:14.485
-Isn't there a way to do this?
-You should make the surface rough.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.862
How do you know that?

03:16.946 --> 03:20.199
My aunt does pottery.
I learned some from her.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.746
I want to learn, too.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.123
I tried baking glass with glaze on it,

03:27.206 --> 03:29.834
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.463
I'll teach you.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.715
I'll be better at it than you.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.845
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:42.222
<i>to hurt each other.</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:44.432
-Isn't it good?
-No.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.642
It's bad?

03:47.977 --> 03:49.270
Isn't it pretty?

03:53.900 --> 03:58.154
EPISODE 6: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

03:59.197 --> 04:03.326
But are you really just friends with him?

04:04.994 --> 04:07.247
Yes. We're just friends.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.873
That's a relief.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.668
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.220
You should just keep your hair that way.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.680
What?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.473
Jae-eon…

04:26.557 --> 04:28.434
likes doing it with your hair tied.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.421
Everyone, take a look at what I gave you.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.048
There's a list of commonly used colors

04:59.132 --> 05:02.844
and the image and keywords

05:02.927 --> 05:06.639
that people associate with those colors.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.184
Even if it's the same color,
the associated images

05:10.768 --> 05:13.146
could be the exact opposite.

05:13.229 --> 05:17.233
And some are different
according to the culture or country.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.696
And of course, it could be different
for each individual.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.072
Good work today.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.700
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

05:27.285 --> 05:29.912
It's finally over!

05:29.996 --> 05:32.040
-Is this it?
-Give me my bag.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.835
Did anyone see Na-bi today?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.629
Na-bi? I haven't seen her.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.214
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.508
-What about you?
-She ignored my message.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.720
-Did she not contact you either?
-No.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.263
Is something wrong?

05:47.346 --> 05:49.140
She's not answering her phone, either.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.060
I'm sure
she just felt like skipping class today.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.227
Na-bi isn't like you.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.022
We'll be off. See you tomorrow!

05:56.105 --> 05:57.356
-Good work today.
-Bye.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.317
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.152
-Bye.
-We're eating lunch.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.613
-I'll be back after lunch.
-Hey!

06:03.696 --> 06:04.822
How about <i>tteokbokki</i>?

06:05.323 --> 06:06.783
Do you want to eat <i>tteokbokki</i>?

06:07.658 --> 06:09.285
-Sure.
-Did you bring your wallet?

06:10.119 --> 06:11.454
My treat.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.830
All right.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.501
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

07:22.108 --> 07:27.280
NOODLE SHOP

07:54.807 --> 07:55.766
I'm worried.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.895
About what?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.772
Na-bi. I can't get in touch with her.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.567
Really?

08:05.443 --> 08:06.694
She must have been shocked.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.739
-What?
-It's nothing.

08:09.822 --> 08:10.740
She's attractive.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.535
You only saw her for a minute,
and you felt that?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.204
I could see why you fell for her.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.830
What are you talking about?

08:19.373 --> 08:20.708
It's not like that.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.836
I broke up with Chris.

08:24.962 --> 08:25.922
Why?

08:29.383 --> 08:31.844
You're actually asking me why?

08:34.138 --> 08:37.099
He said he thought he would be okay

08:37.600 --> 08:39.936
with me seeing other guys, but he wasn't.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.232
But I think I can understand
how that feels now.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.985
So that's it?

08:48.069 --> 08:51.155
Yes. I just let him go.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.616
I did good, right?

08:57.245 --> 09:00.248
What? That's what you hate the most.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.833
Getting clingy.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.340
Ms. Yun Seol-a. This way, please.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.844
You can go if you're busy.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
It's fine. Go on.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.655
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.659
YU NA-BI

09:41.622 --> 09:46.377
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again later…</i>

10:12.236 --> 10:13.946
<i>She disappeared.</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:25.875
Thank you!

10:26.500 --> 10:27.793
Yu Na-bi!

10:28.336 --> 10:29.629
Auntie!

10:32.381 --> 10:35.968
Oh, my.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.013
It's so nice to see you.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.850
-Right, Auntie.
-Yes?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.561
Don't tell my mom I'm here, okay?

10:46.145 --> 10:47.563
Are you involved in some crime?

10:49.398 --> 10:51.317
It's nothing like that.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.902
Then it's fine.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.029
How long are you staying?

10:55.112 --> 10:58.282
About a week?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.409
That long?

11:01.702 --> 11:04.538
What? You don't want me to stay?

11:04.622 --> 11:05.998
It's not that.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.710
I'll clean the house.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.713
All right. Let's take care
of all the household chores

11:12.797 --> 11:15.299
that I've been putting off all this time.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.635
Okay. I'll do my best.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.564
POTTERY WORKSHOP

11:34.235 --> 11:35.778
This feels so great.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.697
-The weather's so nice.
-It is.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.575
Oh, right. I saw Do-hyeok at the market.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.660
He grew up so well.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.246
Do-hyeok came, too?

11:46.622 --> 11:49.917
When you headed back to Seoul
when you were little,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.338
all the other kids came to see you off
but Do-hyeok didn't come.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.256
That's right.

11:55.339 --> 11:59.802
You were crying and whining about it
the whole way there.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.929
No way. I didn't cry.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.266
You did. You two were so close.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.144
Right.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.980
I did like Do-hyeok a lot.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.941
-You liked him the most.
-Come on, it wasn't like that.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.193
-Yes, it was.
-No!

12:18.320 --> 12:21.532
-Give it to me.
-No, I can carry it.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.119
-We're going to your workshop, right?
-Yes. Let's go.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.873
Let's go!

12:29.665 --> 12:32.334
-Come down after you unpack.
-Okay.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.336
-See you later!
-See you later.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.261
You're so cute.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.597
-What are you on about?
-You're so adorable.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.099
-Let's eat.
-No.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.520
-No!
-We don't have time.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.774
But…

13:37.733 --> 13:39.944
don't you think
we should tell the others now?

13:40.027 --> 13:41.987
-Tell them what?
-That we're dating.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.950
Why? It's not like we're getting married.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.910
I want to tell them, though.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.745
Why should we hide it?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.333
No, I don't want to.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.293
Why?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.548
They'll just keep talking about us
if we tell them.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.261
Why don't we kiss some more
instead of arguing?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.304
You're just trying to change the subject.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.306
-No…
-There's no one here!

14:09.390 --> 14:11.183
-Come on, there's nobody…
-Let go of me.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.601
What are you two doing here?

14:12.685 --> 14:13.811
We're eating!

14:13.894 --> 14:16.772
What are you doing here?
Did you come here to make out?

14:16.855 --> 14:19.275
What? We have a platonic relationship.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.360
Wait. I have something to ask.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.572
I heard Ms. Jo and Mr. An

14:24.655 --> 14:27.867
were seen coming out of a motel together.
Is that true?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.036
It wasn't a motel. It was a house.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.414
What? They were in the same house?

14:33.497 --> 14:35.916
-Yes.
-Then they're living together?

14:36.000 --> 14:40.379
Even if they're not,
it means they're dating at least.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.839
No way!

14:41.922 --> 14:43.841
-Why?
-They don't suit each other.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.759
They are so different.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.637
Yes, it's ridiculous.
I don't believe the rumors.

14:49.346 --> 14:54.101
They spend a lot of time together,
so they could have fallen for each other.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.699
YUN SOL

15:11.493 --> 15:13.245
-Hey, Sol.
<i>-Hey, Na-bi!</i>

15:13.329 --> 15:16.206
-Why did you ignore my calls
-Lower your voice.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.791
and answer Sol's?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.337
Oh, it's you, Ji-wan.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.048
<i>You're coming to the workshop, right?
Sol's coming too.</i>

15:26.550 --> 15:28.510
I don't think I can come.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.472
<i>Really? I thought we changed the location
because of you.</i>

15:31.555 --> 15:33.390
What? To where?

15:33.474 --> 15:37.394
<i>You know, the guesthouse
that your noodle shop friend is running.</i>

15:37.478 --> 15:40.731
-You're coming here?
-<i>"Here"? You're there right now?</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:44.777
No, I'm not.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.030
But my aunt lives nearby.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.908
<i>Are you staying there until the weekend?</i>

15:50.991 --> 15:54.036
I am, but…

15:55.162 --> 15:56.413
I still can't come.

15:56.497 --> 16:00.459
<i>Why? You're nearby. Come hang out with us.</i>

16:00.542 --> 16:01.919
-<i>Come on.</i>
-Well…

16:04.672 --> 16:06.131
Is Jae-eon coming?

16:06.215 --> 16:10.386
What? No, he said he has other plans.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.971
Oh, really?

16:12.888 --> 16:14.223
<i>I'll go if I have the time.</i>

16:14.306 --> 16:17.685
<i>And don't tell the others I'm here.</i>

16:17.768 --> 16:19.687
Okay, I won't tell.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.772
Don't ignore my calls anymore, all right?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.483
Okay. Bye, then.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.280
Didn't Jae-eon say he's coming?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.491
-Yes, he did.
-Then why did you lie to her?

16:32.574 --> 16:35.119
I know, right? Why did I do that?

16:35.202 --> 16:38.455
Whatever. I had to say that
to get Na-bi to come.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.458
That might cause huge trouble.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.753
No, they could get back together
thanks to us.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.798
Please don't say "us."

16:47.881 --> 16:50.134
You heard me, so you're an accomplice now.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.886
She doesn't even like him.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.639
I know.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.766
But when she asked if he was coming,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.060
it sounded like she wanted him to come.

17:00.644 --> 17:04.189
So don't tell Na-bi, okay?
You better keep this a secret.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.734
-Okay.
-Let's go watch a movie today.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.069
I have plans.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.072
What? Who? You didn't even tell me.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.241
Se-hun asked to eat lunch with me.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.827
What's he up to this time?

17:17.870 --> 17:19.371
He's not up to anything.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.332
He wanted to ask me something about work.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.126
He can just ask you over the phone.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.971
<i>You have to come to the workshop.</i>

17:39.058 --> 17:40.517
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU?

17:43.687 --> 17:47.107
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.654
You're crazy.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.284
Why are you so pathetic?

17:57.367 --> 18:00.079
No…

18:10.923 --> 18:11.924
I can't do this.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.640
POWER OFF

18:50.671 --> 18:51.755
Hey, Na-bi.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.424
I heard you came today.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.553
Yes. I just arrived.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.889
Where are you headed?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.809
Me? I was going to go see you.

19:03.892 --> 19:04.852
What?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.856
-You were coming to see me?
-Yes.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.277
Then you should've called me.
We could've missed each other.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.904
I did, but your phone was off.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.739
I got worried.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.743
Oh, right. I turned off my phone.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.455
Were you headed somewhere?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.791
I was just taking a walk.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.918
A walk? Then…

19:30.836 --> 19:33.964
Do you want to go to the beach?

20:11.752 --> 20:13.420
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
BEEF TARTARE NOODLES AT A FISHING VILLAGE

20:13.503 --> 20:16.506
Why isn't he showing his face
when he's so handsome?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.800
I'm sure he'd get
way more viewers if he did.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.554
You didn't change the workshop location
because of money, right?

20:23.138 --> 20:24.723
You just want to see him, right?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.893
No. I mean, that's one reason.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.728
It's not the only reason, though.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.774
Don't misunderstand.
I'm just a fan. I mean it.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.109
Come here.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.362
-Oh, my head.
-Why did you do that?

20:38.445 --> 20:41.073
It hurts. Come here and nurse me.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.493
Come on.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.870
-Let's go outside today.
-What?

20:46.954 --> 20:49.122
We kept staying inside.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.793
-Don't you feel stuffy?
-No, not at all.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.295
Come on! Come here.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.799
MYEONGWON-DONG, 26, DIMPLES

20:59.549 --> 21:01.551
Why are you so heavy?

21:03.512 --> 21:04.888
What? Who is it?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.482
-Who is it?
-Just some guy I know.

21:15.565 --> 21:19.403
His name's…
Gosh, I can't remember his name.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.363
Kim…

21:23.615 --> 21:25.117
What? I didn't pick up.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.994
That seems more strange.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.829
Why would he call you?

21:28.912 --> 21:30.956
How would I know? Should I ask him?

21:34.042 --> 21:35.752
You didn't delete that dating app?

21:38.547 --> 21:39.965
Jeez.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.635
Stop trying to change me.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.886
You're suffocating me.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.513
What? Suffocating you?

21:46.596 --> 21:49.224
Yes, you're making a fuss over nothing.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.477
What do you think
being in a relationship means?

21:53.103 --> 21:54.771
Why do you even date me?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.481
Because I like you.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.066
-You like me?
-Yes.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.819
-You really like me?
-Yes. I told you.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.657
Not just having sex with me?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.701
Is it that different?

22:09.077 --> 22:10.787
Gyu-hyun…

22:12.581 --> 22:15.542
Why is everything so complicated for you?

22:15.625 --> 22:16.960
It's not complicated.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.005
To be honest, you haven't changed
at all since we started dating.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.715
Hey, that's ridiculous.

22:21.798 --> 22:25.177
Have you changed, then?
Why am I the only one who has to change?

22:36.855 --> 22:38.106
What are you doing?

22:48.366 --> 22:51.411
I knew you'd be like this.
You boring nerd.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.137
It's been a while since I came here.
It's so nice.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.892
Are you sure it's okay to hang out?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.770
-Don't you need to get ready to open?
-It's okay.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.398
Both the noodle shop and the guesthouse
aren't opening yet.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.776
That's a relief, then.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.319
Can I help you with anything?

23:24.402 --> 23:27.322
I'm good at cooking and cutting.
Use me as your assistant.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.408
It's done.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.371
Wait right here.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.584
All right.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.634
Did you see this yesterday?

23:48.593 --> 23:49.678
I did.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.805
It's amazing.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.516
Oh, right. I wanted to go somewhere.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.018
-This place is popular too.
-Where?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.813
This one. I think it's nearby.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.150
-I reserved a table for two.
-It looks nice.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.777
-Right?
-I didn't know you'd be coming along.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.364
I've always wanted to come here.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.742
And I heard
that you guys were meeting here.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.703
How could I not come?

24:15.453 --> 24:18.957
If you're going to have a serious talk,
I'll leave you two alone.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.835
Is it something important?

24:22.627 --> 24:23.670
What?

24:24.212 --> 24:27.090
Oh, well. It's…

24:28.383 --> 24:30.510
No, it's nothing special.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.554
I just wanted
to have a nice meal together.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.597
I'll pay.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.183
No, my treat. I asked to eat with you.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.729
I'll pay for yours too, Ji-wan.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.147
-Okay.
-Enjoy.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.773
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.525
This looks good! Let's take a photo.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.781
This is awesome.
When did you prepare all this?

24:52.991 --> 24:56.703
I prepared this
when I heard you were coming.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.790
You're really not filming this?

25:01.374 --> 25:04.628
-I shouldn't be the only one seeing this.
-You saw it, so it's fine.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.633
Hey, you're kind of good
at saying sweet things.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.509
You must've dated a lot.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.221
I haven't.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.847
You've never dated?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.682
No. So what?

25:18.725 --> 25:22.103
No, I'm not saying it's weird.
It's just unexpected.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.314
You must be pretty popular.

25:24.397 --> 25:27.400
You have a very gentle and pure image.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.447
I don't know why,

25:33.281 --> 25:36.785
but I kept liking someone
who had a boyfriend.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.120
Oh.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.708
I see…

25:44.584 --> 25:47.087
I'm okay. I have to drive.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.380
Oh, right.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.007
Should I drink alone, then?

25:52.217 --> 25:55.720
Then I'll do this,
so it's like I'm drinking too.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.401
This is so nice.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.452
Do you have someone?

26:20.036 --> 26:21.496
What?

26:22.580 --> 26:26.293
Do you have someone you like?
Or a boyfriend?

26:31.214 --> 26:32.590
Not now.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.682
Eat up.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.851
Okay. Let's eat.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.014
So I dated that jerk for a long time

27:21.639 --> 27:23.516
and broke up early this year.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.068
What? Why are you grinning like that?

27:33.151 --> 27:34.444
Are you laughing at me?

27:35.070 --> 27:36.321
It's not that.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.657
You had a boyfriend before too.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.493
I did?

27:42.577 --> 27:44.954
What do you mean?
That was my first relationship.

27:45.538 --> 27:46.748
What? No, it isn't.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.668
You said you were dating,
so I gave up last time.

27:51.795 --> 27:52.712
"Gave up"?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.429
What?

28:02.055 --> 28:04.474
Hey, don't you need to drive?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.267
You're my first love.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.067
What?

28:17.779 --> 28:20.073
I had a crush on you,

28:20.156 --> 28:23.785
but you were leaving for Seoul,
so I was about to tell you I liked you.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.789
But you said you had a boyfriend,
so I gave up.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.673
I told you I had a boyfriend?

28:38.716 --> 28:41.428
Not to me. You told someone else.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.931
I don't remember saying that.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.227
I guess I didn't want to get teased
for not having a boyfriend.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.606
Hang on.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.985
Is that why you didn't come to see me
when I was leaving?

28:58.445 --> 28:59.738
Yes.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.782
Hey, I was so upset about that!

29:04.617 --> 29:08.413
Would you have accepted me
if I confessed my feelings to you?

29:13.042 --> 29:16.254
I don't know. But I would've
stayed in touch with you.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.841
We were best friends.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.889
Then I guess things
would have been different.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.187
I don't know! You were such an idiot.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.530
-Look at the red dot.
-Okay.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.115
One, two, three.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.243
You did great.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.620
It's my turn now.

30:08.723 --> 30:09.808
Can I sit here?

30:11.226 --> 30:13.228
You're already sitting there.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.731
Are you with someone?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.025
No, I'm not.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.086
Can you hand me the menu?

30:39.295 --> 30:40.463
Sure.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.523
That butterfly is pretty.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.442
What meaning does it have?

31:02.777 --> 31:05.113
The ugliness and pain of happiness,

31:05.196 --> 31:06.531
and lack of freedom.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.658
That's what butterfly tattoos symbolize.

31:08.741 --> 31:09.993
I see.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.204
I just did it
because I like butterflies, though.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.291
Come to think of it,
butterflies look so pretty

31:16.875 --> 31:18.293
but some people say

31:18.376 --> 31:21.963
if you rub your eyes after touching
butterfly wings, you'll become blind.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.009
That's not true.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.679
There's a kind of scale powder
on their wings,

31:29.762 --> 31:33.808
and it's not really that harmful.
It can only cause some allergies.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.687
-No way.
-It's funny, right?

31:39.647 --> 31:42.609
-What do you mean?
-People are so funny.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.945
The butterflies are the ones
that get hurt.

31:46.529 --> 31:47.989
If they lose their scales,

31:48.072 --> 31:50.825
they'll lose the patterns and colors
on their wings.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.620
And they won't be able to fly.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.543
Do you want to see some?

32:15.892 --> 32:18.144
It was my last vacation in the military,

32:18.895 --> 32:21.689
and my friend asked
if I wanted to go see an exhibition.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.526
To be honest, I don't know much about art.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.737
It was my first time going
to an art exhibit.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.739
Right.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.033
But I saw someone

32:32.825 --> 32:35.912
who really looked like you.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.638
<i>I was almost sure it was you,</i>

32:54.138 --> 32:57.183
<i>but it had been such a long time
so I couldn't call your name.</i>

32:57.850 --> 32:59.394
I regretted that after.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.773
But I met you again on the bus.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.110
It really was you at the exhibition.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.114
My heart was beating like crazy.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.199
Isn't that stupid?

34:48.419 --> 34:49.670
Hey, Do-hyeok.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.758
-Do-hyeok!
-Na-bi. Did you sleep well?

34:54.634 --> 34:57.720
Why did you give me the blankets
when you were sleeping outside?

34:57.804 --> 34:59.055
It's okay.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.562
<i>-The thing about Youtube is…
-That's right.</i>

35:06.646 --> 35:09.982
<i>-It's no joke.
-You're talking about views, right?</i>

35:10.066 --> 35:12.443
<i>Getting one million views is amazing.</i>

35:12.527 --> 35:13.945
<i>-That's amazing.
-It is.</i>

35:14.028 --> 35:15.571
<i>-Our couple number 12.
-Couple 12.</i>

35:15.655 --> 35:18.116
<i>When Jae-joon ordered noodles…</i>

35:18.199 --> 35:19.325
Gyeong-jun.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.996
Gyeong-jun! You can't hear me, right?

35:37.385 --> 35:38.761
You startled me.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.681
What the…

35:47.061 --> 35:50.022
-You're not wearing your glasses.
-No.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.818
What?

35:53.901 --> 35:55.987
What is it?

36:04.287 --> 36:05.746
My glasses.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.998
What?

36:07.582 --> 36:10.126
-Those are my glasses.
-What do you mean? They're mine.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.753
Oh, they're yours.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.255
Then where are mine?

36:15.131 --> 36:16.007
Yours?

36:16.716 --> 36:17.550
Oh.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.260
I see.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.054
No wonder. You looked a bit weird.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.431
Here.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
What is it this time?

36:31.939 --> 36:34.650
-Thankfully, it doesn't smell.
-What?

36:34.734 --> 36:37.486
I guess you just fart loudly.

36:38.362 --> 36:41.199
What are you talking about? That's not me!

36:41.282 --> 36:43.618
You were pretty loud!

36:43.701 --> 36:45.870
-Farty pants!
-It wasn't me!

36:45.953 --> 36:47.246
Jeez.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.333
What's with you? I told you, it wasn't me!

36:50.416 --> 36:52.793
You're so annoying!

37:16.609 --> 37:17.568
YU NA-BI

38:29.056 --> 38:30.516
What are you doing here?

38:31.726 --> 38:32.852
Hey.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.897
Did you see Bit-na by any chance?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.149
No, I didn't.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.942
Okay.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.487
Are you joining the workshop?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.614
No. I'm not going.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.243
Why? Everyone will make a fuss
if they hear you're not going.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.830
What about Na-bi?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.499
Na-bi's not coming either.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.419
-You didn't know?
-No.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.630
We're not talking much these days.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.761
You did something wrong, didn't you?

39:08.471 --> 39:09.805
Well…

39:11.057 --> 39:12.224
I'm not sure.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.770
Don't lie. You know what it is.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.358
But still, she likes you.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.862
Can't you treat her sincerely?

39:31.660 --> 39:34.497
Na-bi, be careful
when you're taking them out.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.332
Don't worry.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.598
My stomach hurts.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.393
You must've drunk so much.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.478
I guess it was fun.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.440
-The food was so delicious.
-I know.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.984
And the beach was so pretty.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.365
I should head back to Seoul soon.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.991
I'm resting too much.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.744
That's why you came, though.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.539
Oh, but you should fix that shelf
for me before you go.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.499
Okay.

40:19.291 --> 40:22.086
Look at how pretty they are.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.089
These look a bit strange, though.

40:25.172 --> 40:28.467
Why is the color different?
It's the same glaze.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.344
It was a bit windy a while ago.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.346
Even if you apply the same glaze,

40:32.430 --> 40:35.558
they look different depending
on the humidity or temperature.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.060
So once you start baking them,

40:38.144 --> 40:40.855
you don't get to decide
what color they turn out to be.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.732
Doesn't that make you uneasy?

40:43.816 --> 40:47.987
What do you mean?
It's fun because it's unpredictable.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.614
That's why
I've been doing pottery for so long.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.992
<i>I tried baking glass with glaze on it,</i>

40:53.075 --> 40:56.412
and the color came out different
each time. It was cool.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.669
You're saying the same thing.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.380
What? Same as who?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.425
Never mind.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.761
It's getting scary to do sculpture though.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.182
One mistake could ruin everything.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.227
I feel like it'll be better
to do something digital

41:20.311 --> 41:22.563
where I can save and undo my work.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.733
My goodness.
You're not living up to your name.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.902
You know why your name's Na-bi?

41:27.985 --> 41:30.696
Yes. You said you named me
because your favorite author--

41:30.779 --> 41:34.325
No. You said you had to present it
at school,

41:34.408 --> 41:36.076
so I made that up.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.995
What?

41:38.078 --> 41:41.874
Your mom says she named you like that
so your life would be as sweet as honey.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.001
But butterflies don't always eat honey.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.255
Insects and poop
are all nutrients for them too.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.841
Everything you're going through
in your life right now

41:50.925 --> 41:52.801
are your nutrients.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.346
So what's there to fear?

42:00.392 --> 42:03.312
To be honest,
I don't think I can take it anymore.

42:03.395 --> 42:07.399
When we're together, she acts like
I'm the only one in her life,

42:08.025 --> 42:10.778
so I thought she cared for me too.

42:11.654 --> 42:15.407
But then when she gets interested
in something else, she ignores me.

42:16.116 --> 42:19.036
So I keep getting depressed
even while I'm with her.

42:19.703 --> 42:24.124
She does say that she likes me.
I want to believe that,

42:24.208 --> 42:25.793
but I can't help doubting it.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.089
This isn't what I'm usually like.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.427
Maybe I should have just stuck
to being friends with her.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.680
I've never seen you talk so much.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.434
Why was I blabbering on about that to you?

42:43.143 --> 42:44.979
Have you told her honestly

42:45.479 --> 42:47.189
about what you just said?

42:47.273 --> 42:48.732
No. Never.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.318
It's not easy to be honest with her.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.905
-What?
-I have pride, you know.

42:56.073 --> 43:00.077
I'm already upset since I feel like
I'm the only one who likes her.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.329
What do you want from her?

43:02.913 --> 43:06.625
Certainty about the relationship
and sincerity toward me.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.503
<i>That's unrealistic.</i>

43:09.587 --> 43:12.923
<i>As soon as you have certainty,
that relationship becomes weak.</i>

43:15.634 --> 43:17.011
How does one get

43:18.095 --> 43:19.221
that certainty?

43:19.805 --> 43:21.890
Are you sure it'll help you?

43:22.766 --> 43:24.935
You're pretty twisted, aren't you?

43:25.019 --> 43:27.021
I think you're the one who's twisted.

43:27.104 --> 43:30.566
But anyway, I'm sure there's a reason
why she's staying by your side.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.543
SONG SEO-YEON: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
KIM EUN-JU: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.977
KANG SEO-YEON: YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY!

44:52.523 --> 44:54.858
Oh, Do-hyeok. Come inside.

44:54.942 --> 44:55.901
Yes.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.734
This place is so pretty.

45:40.946 --> 45:41.947
What?

45:43.782 --> 45:45.576
I think I remember this place.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.619
-Really?
-Yes.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.623
You know what?

45:52.166 --> 45:54.918
They say that if you catch a falling leaf
and make a wish,

45:55.002 --> 45:56.545
it'll come true.

45:58.213 --> 46:01.592
What? You believe stuff like that?

46:01.675 --> 46:03.218
It's romantic.

46:04.052 --> 46:05.304
You don't?

46:06.305 --> 46:07.306
No.

46:08.474 --> 46:09.516
I don't.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.101
Why?

46:12.102 --> 46:14.396
Just because. There's no evidence.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.065
But that's why I like it.

46:17.149 --> 46:19.610
I just have to believe in it. That's all.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.655
Is that so?

46:40.756 --> 46:42.716
-I caught one.
-Make a wish.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.390
I don't believe stuff like this.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.268
Forget it. Just give me the camera.

47:00.108 --> 47:04.029
Do-hyeok, why don't you try uploading
vlogs of your daily life?

47:04.112 --> 47:07.491
You can film stuff like preparing
to open your restaurant

47:07.574 --> 47:10.369
instead of always just showing
your hands and scenery.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.371
I bet you'll get way more viewers.

47:12.454 --> 47:14.831
Are my videos boring?

47:16.291 --> 47:17.376
It's not that.

47:21.255 --> 47:24.258
You look really great on camera.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.719
If you reveal your face,
I'm sure you'll get way more subscribers.

47:28.428 --> 47:30.764
-No way. Come on.
-Hey, just once.

47:30.847 --> 47:32.641
Just once. Please?

47:41.608 --> 47:42.985
What's that?

47:43.652 --> 47:45.612
One, two, three.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.990
See? You look great.

47:48.073 --> 47:50.784
-Let me take a photo of you too.
-No, not me.

47:52.077 --> 47:53.287
I look awful in photos.

47:53.370 --> 47:55.038
No, you looked pretty.

47:56.790 --> 47:57.874
What?

47:59.084 --> 48:03.297
Oh, to be honest,
I took a photo of you last time.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.881
-Sorry.
-When?

48:05.507 --> 48:07.884
-At the beach.
-Do you have it now?

48:07.968 --> 48:09.177
-Yes.
-Let me see.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.689
They look good, right?

48:22.441 --> 48:23.317
Well…

48:24.192 --> 48:25.277
This one is nice.

48:30.574 --> 48:31.533
They came out nice.

48:53.513 --> 48:54.348
Happy birthday.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.682
Thanks.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.186
-You don't have a gift for me?
-A gift?

49:00.312 --> 49:03.190
Of course I do.
But I don't know if you'll like it.

49:15.410 --> 49:18.664
-Did you want this that badly?
-I must have lost my mind.

49:19.998 --> 49:21.124
I wanted to have it.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.797
I lied to your friend Na-bi.

49:27.964 --> 49:31.218
-Lied about what?
-She asked if we were dating,

49:32.260 --> 49:33.178
and I said yes.

49:36.515 --> 49:40.018
She believed me right away.
I didn't know she'd disappear like that.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.646
Sorry about that.

49:50.153 --> 49:53.281
She didn't just stay quiet though.

50:15.011 --> 50:15.971
We're here.

50:17.472 --> 50:18.306
You should go.

50:18.890 --> 50:22.436
-I'll come and pick you up tomorrow.
-No, it's fine.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.896
I'll see you at the market.
I can go there alone.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.857
It's dangerous at that hour.

50:26.940 --> 50:29.067
I'll be off. See you tomorrow.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.445
Okay…

50:38.618 --> 50:41.455
PARK JAE-EON

50:43.957 --> 50:44.916
PARK JAE-EON

50:48.587 --> 50:50.881
PARK JAE-EON
WHERE ARE YOU, LET'S TALK

51:09.733 --> 51:12.110
Na-bi, let's eat some apples.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.571
Okay. I'm all done.

51:24.289 --> 51:25.832
"Where are you? Let's talk."

51:27.417 --> 51:29.002
That means you're angry, right?

51:30.629 --> 51:32.172
What's this random question?

51:34.132 --> 51:36.134
I promised myself I would never date

51:36.218 --> 51:38.303
while watching my mom.

51:38.386 --> 51:40.889
When did you make such a decision?

51:40.972 --> 51:42.682
When I was little.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.643
The day before I left for Seoul,

51:44.726 --> 51:47.229
Mom came here and cried her eyes out.

51:47.312 --> 51:48.563
Oh, that day.

51:49.147 --> 51:51.441
She really liked that man.

51:52.317 --> 51:54.528
It was pretty intense.

51:54.611 --> 51:58.365
I told her he was a scumbag
and that she should break up with him,

51:58.448 --> 52:00.075
but she never listened.

52:00.659 --> 52:02.452
But still, she dated him.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.789
There was nothing between us.
I don't know why I did that.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.707
I was so stupid. It's so embarrassing.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.835
This is the worst.

52:10.418 --> 52:14.047
Hey, there is always
something between people.

52:19.719 --> 52:22.264
I still respect your mom.

52:22.347 --> 52:23.765
She got so hurt,

52:23.849 --> 52:26.893
but she falls passionately in love
with new people.

52:29.271 --> 52:30.647
That's nonsense.

52:31.648 --> 52:34.401
Your mom said that dating

52:34.484 --> 52:37.445
isn't about picking the nicest person.

52:37.529 --> 52:39.781
It's about meeting someone special to you.

52:42.450 --> 52:45.036
I think that's why she failed each time.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.246
You're wrong about that.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.456
If she failed each time,

52:48.540 --> 52:50.959
how could she have gotten
such a precious daughter?

52:55.547 --> 52:56.423
Here.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.761
The shelf's crooked.

53:02.387 --> 53:04.806
Oh, no. I drilled all the holes already.

53:06.266 --> 53:08.977
Why isn't anything working out?

53:31.166 --> 53:33.877
You look great today, as usual. Come in.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.133
Happy birthday.

53:41.134 --> 53:43.720
I heard that there's a lot of things

53:43.803 --> 53:46.014
to carry and move for sculpture majors.

53:48.558 --> 53:49.476
This is too much.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.186
Let me at least do this.

53:58.902 --> 54:00.070
Thank you.

54:07.827 --> 54:08.995
Mom.

54:10.705 --> 54:12.916
Did the performance go well?

54:12.999 --> 54:15.251
Yes. I'm performing in Paris next.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.506
How is Paris?

54:20.090 --> 54:22.258
It's nice.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.136
Do you want to come with me?

54:27.681 --> 54:29.099
Someone wanted to go there.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.726
It must be someone you like.

54:34.562 --> 54:35.522
No.

54:37.482 --> 54:38.984
Just someone bothersome.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.826
Jae-eon.

54:48.910 --> 54:51.079
You know what I regret the most?

54:53.123 --> 54:55.291
Not knowing my own feelings.

54:55.375 --> 54:56.626
No…

54:58.545 --> 54:59.796
pretending not to know.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.219
Who would love someone

55:06.302 --> 55:08.346
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

55:46.676 --> 55:47.927
All right.

56:19.584 --> 56:22.045
Who would love someone

56:22.128 --> 56:24.130
who doesn't even take care of themselves?

56:26.508 --> 56:30.887
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

56:30.970 --> 56:32.138
<i>can never be happy.</i>

56:32.722 --> 56:34.307
That's what you hate the most.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.392
Getting clingy.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.186
What?

56:38.269 --> 56:41.022
You always draw the line like this.

56:42.107 --> 56:45.026
You just want to see me when you want,

56:45.110 --> 56:46.653
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

56:46.736 --> 56:48.321
Don't worry.

56:48.905 --> 56:50.740
That's not going to happen.

58:30.882 --> 58:32.300
Hey, Na-bi.

58:33.218 --> 58:34.636
-Hi.
-Hi.

58:43.311 --> 58:44.687
Did you sleep well?

58:44.771 --> 58:47.774
-Yes. You?
-Me too.

58:47.857 --> 58:49.192
-Should we go?
-Okay.

59:41.786 --> 59:43.538
-Sir.
-Yes?

59:43.621 --> 59:44.706
Can you watch these?

59:44.789 --> 59:47.000
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.543
Thank you.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.052
Hey, let's try this.

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:04.892
-Could we have some sweet potatoes?
-Okay.

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:06.728
Hello.

1:00:06.811 --> 1:00:08.646
Oh, you brought your girlfriend.

1:00:10.189 --> 1:00:13.234
You two look so sweet together.

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:15.361
We're not…

1:00:16.237 --> 1:00:18.448
-Well…
-Why aren't you saying anything?

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.786
That will be 8,000 won.

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:26.497
Some potatoes too.

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:28.458
-Potatoes?
-Just a few.

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:30.376
Let's see.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:32.045
You look so happy.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:34.213
That's 13,000 won.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:35.298
Thirteen thousand?

1:00:35.381 --> 1:00:39.302
I'll give you a discount
since your girlfriend is so pretty.

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.846
-Just give me 10,000 won.
-Thank you.

1:00:41.929 --> 1:00:43.931
-You're so pretty.
-Thank you.

1:00:44.849 --> 1:00:47.143
-You got a discount thanks to me.
-Okay. I'll cook something nice.

1:00:47.226 --> 1:00:49.187
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:51.022
It's so pretty.

1:00:51.105 --> 1:00:52.190
How much are those?

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:54.442
Those flowers? They're 23,000 won.

1:00:54.525 --> 1:00:56.444
-What? 23,000 won?
-Yes.

1:00:56.527 --> 1:00:58.029
-I'll take those.
-All right.

1:00:59.572 --> 1:01:00.740
-Hey.
-What?

1:01:00.823 --> 1:01:02.992
It's fine. We'll come back next time.

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:10.958
It seems like it's broken.

1:01:12.710 --> 1:01:15.672
Why did you do that, Do-hyeok?

1:01:15.755 --> 1:01:18.049
-I didn't do it.
-Jeez.

1:01:19.384 --> 1:01:20.385
Hey, Na-bi.

1:01:22.762 --> 1:01:25.098
Hey, it's really Na-bi!

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:29.394
-Who…
-Oh, I guess you don't remember.

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:31.396
My cousin, Do-yeon.

1:01:33.189 --> 1:01:37.110
Oh, right. Do-yeon.

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:38.361
It's been a long time.

1:01:38.444 --> 1:01:41.781
-You're unbelievable!
-Don't say anything weird.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:44.200
I mean, I was so surprised.
You look so pretty!

1:01:44.283 --> 1:01:46.160
-You're right.
-No…

1:01:46.244 --> 1:01:48.454
You've grown so much.
I didn't recognize you.

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:53.292
Na-bi. The tire's flat.
You can't ride it now.

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:54.335
Did I do that?

1:01:54.419 --> 1:01:58.214
No, it's not your fault.
I think someone played a prank.

1:01:58.297 --> 1:02:01.092
-Let's go get it fixed.
-Okay.

1:02:01.175 --> 1:02:02.468
There's no need for that.

1:02:02.969 --> 1:02:04.804
You two can ride yours together.

1:02:04.887 --> 1:02:07.098
I'll get this fixed and ride it home.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:11.894
What are you waiting for? Come on.

1:02:12.478 --> 1:02:13.604
Bye.

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:17.525
-See you later, Do-yeon.
-Thanks!

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:32.457
What are you doing?

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:35.793
Oh, in case it's uncomfortable for you.

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:43.968
Get on.

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:57.106
Let's go.

1:03:21.631 --> 1:03:23.466
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:26.219
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

1:03:27.428 --> 1:03:30.473
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:31.849
Tell me what?

1:03:31.933 --> 1:03:33.226
I'll tell you later.

1:03:51.744 --> 1:03:53.996
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.916
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:46.632
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

1:04:48.175 --> 1:04:49.927
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.282
<i>How have you been?</i>

1:05:53.366 --> 1:05:55.034
<i>Fine. So-so.</i>

1:05:55.117 --> 1:05:56.452
<i>I haven't been well.</i>

1:05:56.535 --> 1:06:00.498
<i>His familiar smells are haunting me.</i>

1:06:00.581 --> 1:06:03.125
<i>He's charming.
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.</i>

1:06:03.209 --> 1:06:05.628
They look like newlyweds.

1:06:05.711 --> 1:06:08.130
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

1:06:08.214 --> 1:06:11.759
What is your relationship to Jae-eon?

1:06:11.842 --> 1:06:13.052
<i>There's nothing between us.</i>

1:06:13.844 --> 1:06:16.681
I kept thinking about you. I missed you.

1:06:16.764 --> 1:06:18.182
You have a girlfriend.

1:06:18.265 --> 1:06:19.100
That's not the issue.

1:06:19.183 --> 1:06:21.435
Stop playing games with me.

1:06:21.519 --> 1:06:22.895
<i>Let's end this.</i>

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:24.188
<i>-Stop it.
-What?</i>

1:06:24.271 --> 1:06:25.314
<i>What you're doing right now.</i>

1:06:25.398 --> 1:06:26.315
<i>Where's Na-bi?</i>

1:06:26.399 --> 1:06:28.484
-She said she's too tired to come.
-She's not coming?

1:06:28.567 --> 1:06:31.195
<i>Just tell me if you don't want this.</i>

1:06:32.321 --> 1:06:36.534
