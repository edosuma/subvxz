WEBVTT

00:05.121 --> 00:07.865
Mmm, blonde.

00:07.996 --> 00:10.094
More fun.

00:10.323 --> 00:13.404
Everything is more fun.

00:14.584 --> 00:18.353
Donna, if you only knew what I'd like
to do with you and your new hair,

00:18.451 --> 00:21.237
you would beat the crap out of me.

00:21.434 --> 00:25.236
- You know, I just might beat the crap out of you anyway.
- Yes.

00:26.252 --> 00:31.104
So now that Donna's not big red anymore, I guess we have
to go back to what we called her when she was 12...

00:31.202 --> 00:32.874
jugs-a-poppin'.

00:33.234 --> 00:37.692
- Man, I hated jugs-a-poppin'.
- Well, you shouldn't have had poppin' jugs.

00:37.823 --> 00:43.133
Speaking of objectifying women, Jackie, there's a "Take back
the night" rally tonight at the park.  Do you want to go?

00:43.207 --> 00:47.437
Oh, and be with your deep-voiced
gal pals? Hmm, no, thank you.

00:47.492 --> 00:52.283
This is important. Women should be able to walk through
the park at night without being harassed by weirdo men.

00:52.381 --> 00:54.839
Hey, that was one time.

00:56.674 --> 00:59.329
- I'll go.
- Really?

00:59.755 --> 01:02.082
You'd be, like, the only guy there.

01:02.246 --> 01:05.328
Although there is some question about shirley.

01:05.721 --> 01:09.883
No, it'll be great. Why don't you come by when
Hyde's dad is here? We'll go over there after that.

01:09.982 --> 01:14.669
Yeah, it's my steven's big night. He finally
decided he wants to meet his real daddy.

01:14.767 --> 01:18.405
Kept hearing this voice telling me,
"Meet your father. Meet your father."

01:18.503 --> 01:21.846
So finally, I said, "Okay."
Jackie shut the hell up.

01:22.802 --> 01:25.325
I did. It's a true story.

01:26.014 --> 01:28.210
Get off the phone!

01:29.062 --> 01:31.913
Okay, any minute now
Brooke is going into labor,

01:31.979 --> 01:37.288
all right? And I gave her the number of all
the places I was gonna be. I cannot miss this call.

01:38.173 --> 01:40.435
Lookin' good there, big red.

01:40.631 --> 01:43.516
We're going with jugs-a-poppin' again.

01:43.647 --> 01:45.810
Oh, that's a good one,

01:45.909 --> 01:49.743
and it's as true now as it
was the first day of fifth grade.

01:50.432 --> 01:52.890
That was a poppin' summer.

01:57.807 --> 02:03.739
Steven, I am so happy we finally
found your real father. Here,

02:03.837 --> 02:07.115
I framed the blood test results for you.

02:07.672 --> 02:14.194
Now I spoke to him this morning, and I told him how
your parents abandoned you, and we took you in,

02:14.293 --> 02:20.023
and it's hard for you to say it out loud,
but that you love me because I saved your life.

02:20.154 --> 02:23.956
- Kitty, I'm not sure...
- He would be dead on the streets.

02:24.579 --> 02:31.068
Okay, he's here. Now, Steven, fix your hair. Eric,
don't mumble. Red, don't yell at Eric if he mumbles.

02:32.609 --> 02:34.575
Hi, is this the Formans?

02:38.378 --> 02:44.933
You know, I'm sorry. I told your friend last week
we don't want a subscription to "ebony" magazine.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.080
No, no, no, no. We spoke over the phone.

02:48.145 --> 02:51.488
I'm William Barnett. I'm Steven's father.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.635
Oh!

02:55.290 --> 02:58.338
I mean, come in. Come in.

02:59.248 --> 03:04.885
Everybody, I want you to meet
Steven's father. Steven, look.

03:05.672 --> 03:07.671
I'm looking.

03:08.097 --> 03:11.506
It's good to meet you, son.
I've really been looking forward to this.

03:11.604 --> 03:15.570
Wanted to get you a card, but they
don't have one for our unique situation.

03:15.668 --> 03:18.815
So here. Happy first communion.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.964
Wow.

03:21.456 --> 03:23.815
You came from him?

03:23.914 --> 03:28.666
Yeah, I'm not sure I see the resemblance.

03:28.797 --> 03:32.009
What are you talking about? My 'fro,

03:32.402 --> 03:36.860
my coolness, my suspicion of the man...

03:37.450 --> 03:40.630
this explains so much.

04:18.687 --> 04:22.589
Well, Mr. Barnett, please sit anywhere
you'd like on this big day.

04:22.652 --> 04:26.574
After all, how often does a kid
get to meet his very own father?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.887
So far I'm up to twice.

04:30.789 --> 04:35.152
Hey, would you like a drink?
Perhaps a cool drink for our....

04:35.236 --> 04:37.144
cool visitor.

04:38.256 --> 04:42.297
No, thanks, but I think
all of you could use a scotch.

04:43.345 --> 04:46.471
That's crazy. We're totally relaxed.

04:48.883 --> 04:51.190
Hey, you know what show I love?

04:51.714 --> 04:53.581
"The Jeffersons."

04:55.490 --> 04:58.237
Dyn-o-mite! Right?

04:59.265 --> 05:03.104
"Dyn-o-mite" is from "Good times."

05:03.451 --> 05:04.517
Oh,

05:05.601 --> 05:08.443
well, I watch them all.
I mean, I don't discriminate.

05:09.776 --> 05:13.093
So father and son.

05:13.310 --> 05:14.226
Yep.

05:14.276 --> 05:15.676
Well, I..

05:15.926 --> 05:20.526
I guess Steven must have gotten
his mother's... eyes. Eyes.

05:22.010 --> 05:25.010
Steven got his mother's pretty eyes.

05:25.318 --> 05:26.300
Right.

05:26.343 --> 05:27.727
Or as I like to say,

05:27.793 --> 05:29.160
right on.

05:34.176 --> 05:38.987
Okay, well, nobody's talking about
the elephant in the room, so I'll do it.

05:39.621 --> 05:41.404
You're black.

05:47.808 --> 05:49.458
Mom!

05:50.491 --> 05:54.008
Okay, please, Mr. Barnett, we're very open-minded.

05:54.208 --> 06:00.125
Oh, no, he's right. I, myself,
love that singer Art Garfunkel.

06:01.758 --> 06:04.075
Art Garfunkel is white.

06:05.091 --> 06:06.658
Really?

06:07.932 --> 06:10.682
Well, his name's got the "funk" in it, so I...

06:11.815 --> 06:13.498
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

06:13.565 --> 06:17.048
Red, who's that black person I like?

06:18.250 --> 06:20.517
- Martin Luther King?
- Yes!

06:26.350 --> 06:30.503
You know, I'm beginning to feel like you
haven't had a lot of black people in this house.

06:30.836 --> 06:33.286
Well, I mean, certainly not
because we didn't want to.

06:33.753 --> 06:37.686
Right, right. No, it's just there
haven't been any available.

06:39.419 --> 06:41.502
You know, it's Wisconsin.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.552
Well, I know all about Wisconsin.

06:43.586 --> 06:47.836
The only place around here where you'll
see white and black together is on a cow.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.312
Yeah, sure, sure, yeah.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.112
So, William,

06:54.512 --> 06:57.629
- What kind of work do you do?
- I own a chain of record stores.

06:57.712 --> 07:00.296
Record stores... that's cool, huh?

07:00.363 --> 07:02.813
I was afraid you were
gonna be a cop or something.

07:02.979 --> 07:04.529
I don't like cops.

07:05.013 --> 07:06.729
I don't like cops, either.

07:07.246 --> 07:09.429
Hey, who do you think shot J.F.K.?

07:09.579 --> 07:13.427
I don't know because
they don't want me to know.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.760
Check it out, man.
I'm a chip off the old block.

07:17.143 --> 07:19.464
Man, I wish mom had told me about you.

07:19.509 --> 07:22.042
- Hey, when was the last time you saw her?
- Oh, years ago.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.509
We were dating, and she just disappeared.

07:24.559 --> 07:27.572
I guess she married the man you thought was
your father and told him that you were his baby.

07:27.634 --> 07:28.676
Yeah,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.738
mom must have been pretty relieved
when I came out white, huh?

07:40.579 --> 07:42.516
Hello. Brooke, it's me

07:42.621 --> 07:44.662
Did you have the baby yet?

07:46.371 --> 07:48.850
No, are you sure?

07:51.433 --> 07:54.675
Okay, well, I'm in the kitchen now, so...

07:54.800 --> 07:58.321
No, it's the same number, but
I'm in the kitchen, so when you call...

07:58.571 --> 08:01.967
No, you just gotta think,
"kitchen, kitchen, kitchen."

08:02.258 --> 08:03.613
Okay.

08:04.425 --> 08:09.604
This is so exciting. You're going to be
a father. and I'm going to be all alone.

08:10.916 --> 08:12.687
My clock is ticking.

08:12.833 --> 08:15.000
I just don't want to screw
this thing up, you know?

08:15.062 --> 08:18.979
When that kid opens his eyes, I want his daddy
who loves him to be the first thing he sees.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.508
Plus, I don't want him to get switched at birth
with one of those babies that doesn't speak english.

08:26.778 --> 08:29.091
Why are you here?!

08:29.528 --> 08:31.716
This isn't your home!

08:31.779 --> 08:35.174
It still wouldn't kill you
to put up some pictures of me.

08:36.654 --> 08:38.029
I got it!

08:39.133 --> 08:40.404
Hello.

08:40.633 --> 08:43.320
Charlie Schmidt!

08:43.383 --> 08:47.118
I haven't talked to you since the war.

08:47.368 --> 08:51.660
You know, I wasn't even sure
they pulled you out of the water.

08:52.389 --> 08:56.618
- If I had known
- Never call here again!

08:56.722 --> 08:59.639
- Kelso!
- Well, I gotta keep the line open.

08:59.701 --> 09:03.326
I'm gonna kill you and
mount your head on the TV.

09:04.472 --> 09:07.055
And if it helps me get better reception,

09:07.118 --> 09:10.847
it'll do more for me than
you have in your whole life.

09:14.222 --> 09:18.358
Ooh, Fez, Michael, meet
William Barnett, Steven's father.

09:18.421 --> 09:20.254
Good to meet you both.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.171
Would you look at that.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.296
Yeah, I'm half black, man.

09:29.713 --> 09:32.650
It kinda puts all the pieces
of the puzzle together, don't it?

09:32.692 --> 09:36.442
Hey, I'm having a kid soon.
I wonder if mine's gonna be half black.

09:38.546 --> 09:40.371
Is the mother black?

09:40.767 --> 09:42.079
No.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.912
I have to say, Mr. Barnett,

09:45.966 --> 09:48.916
it's nice to see another
person of color in this town.

09:50.428 --> 09:52.961
White people, you know what I'm talking about?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.195
Can't say that I do.

09:58.761 --> 10:00.961
Oh, I hear you, brother man.

10:02.752 --> 10:07.944
Eric, are you ready to go? I want to get to the
feminist rally in time for the Hugh Hefner piñata.

10:08.152 --> 10:11.736
Mr. Barnett, this is Donna. Donna, this is...

10:11.777 --> 10:15.277
I'm Steven's father.
I'm black, and it's okay.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.263
Wow.

10:19.313 --> 10:24.213
Whoa, Donna, please, do not flip out on
the man just because of the color of his skin.

10:25.030 --> 10:26.480
I would never do that.

10:26.747 --> 10:28.447
I would never do that.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.630
Okay, Donna, let's just go,

10:30.663 --> 10:35.380
and maybe in the car we can have a little talk
about how hurtful our preconceived notions can be.

10:36.648 --> 10:37.715
Power.

10:41.715 --> 10:43.498
Steven, this is so exciting.

10:43.531 --> 10:46.098
- I know. I met my dad.
- And he's rich.

10:46.164 --> 10:50.731
Now instead of waiting for you to get off your butt
and make some money, we can just inherit it.

10:51.864 --> 10:54.240
Wait a minute. You mean inherit it from me?

10:54.307 --> 10:58.624
No, no, no, no. All she means
is that you are doing quite well.

10:58.724 --> 11:03.540
When I talked to your secretary, and she
put me on hold, there was music on the line.

11:03.874 --> 11:09.090
I thought to myself, "Well, this is a man
who can afford a thing or two."

11:09.507 --> 11:12.557
I see. So you knew I had money
before you invited me here.

11:12.607 --> 11:14.457
Is that supposed to mean something?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.857
I don't know.

11:16.307 --> 11:18.040
Why don't you tell me, Steven?

11:20.457 --> 11:21.790
What are you talking about?

11:22.674 --> 11:25.174
Well, I mean, we don't have to play games.

11:25.224 --> 11:27.641
I can give you money
if that's what you're after.

11:27.857 --> 11:29.691
That's who you think I am?

11:31.924 --> 11:34.640
- I'll see you guys later... No, you know what?
- Steven.

11:34.690 --> 11:38.780
I didn't need anything from him growing up,
and I don't need anything from him now.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.397
You know, that was very rude of you.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.963
And I can't believe I'm saying this
to someone wearing cashmere, but,

11:48.013 --> 11:50.746
well, I don't think we can be friends.

11:58.499 --> 12:00.299
How could you say that to Steven?

12:00.332 --> 12:03.532
He doesn't want your money.
I want your money.

12:03.899 --> 12:07.149
How could you think that
anybody here needs your money?

12:07.215 --> 12:09.182
Look at this place.

12:10.432 --> 12:12.332
Glass grapes,

12:12.465 --> 12:14.249
pizza rolls,

12:14.319 --> 12:15.952
an organ..

12:16.602 --> 12:18.685
It's like carnegie hall.

12:20.119 --> 12:23.469
I stand by what I said.
What else was I supposed to think?

12:23.569 --> 12:29.354
You're supposed to look at me
and know that I raised fine young men,

12:29.421 --> 12:33.088
even though one of them is at a feminist rally.

12:33.421 --> 12:37.038
Mr. Barnett, you are wrong
about Steven. He's perfect.

12:37.088 --> 12:38.821
I think you should go.

12:39.038 --> 12:40.454
I agree.

12:41.204 --> 12:44.321
I was gonna pack yousome leftovers, but

12:44.387 --> 12:46.771
that ship has sailed, mister.

12:50.371 --> 12:55.236
I hope this doesn't discourage you from
inviting a second black person into your home.

13:01.086 --> 13:03.069
- What do we want?
- A safe park!

13:03.102 --> 13:04.819
- And when do we want it?
- Now!

13:04.852 --> 13:08.302
- I can't hear you, ladies. When do we want it?
- Now!

13:08.335 --> 13:10.035
Whoo! Yeah!

13:10.635 --> 13:13.069
Take back the night!

13:14.452 --> 13:16.336
This feels really good, Donna.

13:16.386 --> 13:20.186
Women should be able to walk
through this park without being afraid.

13:20.236 --> 13:22.169
In fact, some day I hope that

13:22.269 --> 13:25.097
I can walk through this park
without being afraid.

13:26.534 --> 13:28.222
It helps to whistle.

13:28.690 --> 13:30.612
Well, I'm really glad you came with me.

13:30.863 --> 13:34.403
And I love seeing how passionate
you got singing "I am woman."

13:34.904 --> 13:37.177
I'm having a lot of fun, Donna.

13:37.578 --> 13:39.968
And I'm sorry, but you look so hot,

13:40.520 --> 13:44.923
your new blonde hair shining in the light
of the burning effigy of that molester.

13:47.564 --> 13:49.887
Hey, I got an idea.

13:50.355 --> 13:54.266
Why don't we go "take back"
the area behind that bench?

13:54.713 --> 13:56.852
- When do you want it?
- Now.

14:06.727 --> 14:09.217
Brooke, did you have the baby yet?

14:12.693 --> 14:13.880
Fez?

14:13.971 --> 14:16.545
No, this is your baby,

14:17.230 --> 14:20.058
and I'm really ugly.

14:20.125 --> 14:24.470
Okay, I know this is a prank 'cause
there's no way my baby would be ugly.

14:28.789 --> 14:29.742
Hello.

14:29.792 --> 14:32.148
Yes, is your refrigerator running?

14:32.767 --> 14:35.962
Because if it is, you'd better go catch it.
Ah-burn!

14:36.012 --> 14:38.419
Stop calling me!

14:42.848 --> 14:44.051
What?!

14:44.472 --> 14:45.977
Are you mad?

14:46.963 --> 14:48.851
No, Fez.

14:48.918 --> 14:50.857
You sound mad.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.431
I'm fine.

14:52.448 --> 14:55.527
You say the words, but
I can tell you don't mean it.

14:55.908 --> 14:59.287
Look, just don't call me anymore.

15:03.047 --> 15:06.215
Why do you keep hanging up
on me if you're not mad?

15:06.366 --> 15:10.293
I'm waiting to hear from
the mother of my child.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.182
So you are mad.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.721
Curl up with the phone
so we can talk this over.

15:15.771 --> 15:18.996
- Fez, I'm hanging up.
- Fine. Just hang up then.

15:19.046 --> 15:20.300
Fine.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.077
Are you still there?

15:34.784 --> 15:36.586
Yeah, I'm still here.

15:37.773 --> 15:39.093
Hey.

15:40.196 --> 15:41.466
Hey.

15:43.555 --> 15:45.528
Thanks for not hanging up.

15:51.134 --> 15:55.463
I'm just so mad at that William Barnett.
I mean, thinking you wanted something from him.

15:55.513 --> 15:58.625
Everyone knows I'm all you've ever desired.

15:59.895 --> 16:03.372
Look, if I was in his place, I probably would
have thought the same thing, you know?

16:03.472 --> 16:05.966
It's not a big deal.
I just wanted to meet the guy and

16:06.032 --> 16:09.124
find out if he looked like
I imagined my father would look like.

16:10.996 --> 16:12.835
By the way, no.

16:13.136 --> 16:15.411
Well, who needs a father anyway?

16:15.862 --> 16:21.728
You know what? I've been doing just fine since my dad disappeared
into the jungle to bring freedom to the grateful natives.

16:22.063 --> 16:26.178
Jackie, your father's in prison for
embezzling $60,000 from the city.

16:26.529 --> 16:28.952
I'm pretty. Don't contradict me.

16:33.931 --> 16:37.658
Hey, hey, ho, ho!
This park is our sand "no" means no.

16:37.708 --> 16:42.321
Hey, hey, ho, ho!
This park is our sand "no" means no.

16:43.053 --> 16:44.311
You know what's great?

16:44.428 --> 16:47.754
There's, like, half a dozen women
on the other side of that hedge

16:48.038 --> 16:50.495
who would kill to be where I am right now.

16:53.085 --> 16:55.849
- Ow, ow,you're on my hair.
- Your beautiful blonde hair?

16:55.879 --> 16:57.918
Ow! Get off! Get off!

16:57.952 --> 17:01.228
Hey, there's a woman in trouble!
Let's get him, sisters!

17:02.049 --> 17:03.570
No, no!

17:03.637 --> 17:06.744
That's right, you pervert. "No" means no.

17:06.929 --> 17:10.521
No, ladies, please, I'm one of you.

17:10.605 --> 17:12.694
Let's put these work boots to use!

17:12.761 --> 17:14.683
Yeah!

17:14.951 --> 17:18.479
Run, Eric! Run like Bruce Jenner.

17:18.797 --> 17:21.270
Oh, crap, he doesn't know sports.

17:24.512 --> 17:27.036
Open up, it's dr. Baby doctor.

17:28.490 --> 17:30.896
I have your baby, and he wants to talk to you.

17:35.075 --> 17:36.696
It's just me.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.964
I'm not a doctor,

17:40.466 --> 17:42.438
and I don't have your baby.

17:43.039 --> 17:45.012
Ah-burn!

17:45.697 --> 17:47.418
That was a good one.

17:48.137 --> 17:52.664
Listen, this baby stuff's, like, really important
to me, okay? So I'm trying to take it seriously.

17:52.714 --> 17:56.692
Hey, say no more.
My sensitive friend, I am sorry.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.185
No more phone pranks from now on.

18:03.501 --> 18:06.125
Learn to trust your friends.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.379
Mr. Sexy's pizza.

18:19.078 --> 18:21.602
Our special today is sexaroni.

18:22.488 --> 18:23.926
Fez, God!

18:25.296 --> 18:26.549
Hello.

18:26.884 --> 18:28.187
Brooke!

18:28.555 --> 18:29.829
What?

18:30.012 --> 18:31.868
Your water broke?

18:33.138 --> 18:35.093
What does that mean?

18:36.063 --> 18:38.536
Oh, god, that's disgusting!

18:39.438 --> 18:41.962
No, why would you tell me that?

18:42.697 --> 18:46.942
Oh, Jeez! Okay.
Okay, I'm on my way.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.977
This is it! I'm having a baby!
Go get 'em, buddy!

18:59.650 --> 19:01.705
Mr. Sexy's pizza.

19:03.477 --> 19:06.318
Our special today is sexaroni.

19:08.207 --> 19:11.405
Well, it's like pepperoni, but sexy.

19:17.371 --> 19:19.948
You... you mean you want some?

19:28.377 --> 19:30.199
We're closed.

19:42.313 --> 19:43.132
Hey.

19:43.332 --> 19:44.084
Hey,

19:44.703 --> 19:47.778
I was wondering if maybe
we could try this again.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.723
Yeah, I mean, it worked
so well the first time.

19:51.492 --> 19:54.383
I'm sorry about that. Thing is,

19:54.433 --> 19:57.475
if I grew up with nothing,
and found out I had a dad with money,

19:57.541 --> 19:59.647
I would have thought maybe
he owed me something.

20:00.483 --> 20:02.041
Well, that's not me.

20:02.392 --> 20:03.511
I know,

20:03.745 --> 20:07.188
but when we first met,
I thought I saw myself in you.

20:09.344 --> 20:10.932
Yeah, I can see that.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.096
You and me..

20:13.514 --> 20:15.453
it's like looking in a mirror.

20:16.573 --> 20:18.311
So you want to go get
a beer or something?

20:18.344 --> 20:20.885
I can get you in some places
you've probably never been to.

20:21.018 --> 20:23.727
Oh, like that cool jazz bar off the highway?

20:23.794 --> 20:26.652
No, no, I'm talking about
country clubs, fancy restaurants.

20:26.702 --> 20:28.524
I'm rich as hell, man.

20:33.201 --> 20:35.023
Everything okay here, Steven?

20:35.090 --> 20:36.360
Yeah, everything's fine.

20:36.410 --> 20:39.118
I am so glad you're back.

20:39.168 --> 20:43.630
I felt horrible letting you go off
without any leftovers.

20:44.637 --> 20:46.108
It was nice meeting you, Red,

20:46.409 --> 20:49.635
and you're right. You have
raised some fine young men.

20:57.042 --> 20:58.897
Yeah,

20:59.006 --> 21:01.014
I'm real proud of 'em.

21:01.883 --> 21:04.025
They stole all my clothes.

21:04.075 --> 21:07.552
- Who?
- The angry mob of feminists.

21:08.070 --> 21:11.763
Oh, man, look at you.  They even
shaved off all your body hair.

21:13.017 --> 21:14.315
Yes.

21:15.936 --> 21:17.775
Yes, they did.

21:23.672 --> 21:28.137
So Kelso has a child. I cannot wait to see
the smile on that sweet little face,

21:28.178 --> 21:30.598
And I bet the baby's cute, too.

21:30.678 --> 21:33.940
It is so cool that Steven's father's rich.

21:34.007 --> 21:38.245
It almost makes up for my father
Being locked away in pris... I mean,

21:38.299 --> 21:40.207
Native land.

21:41.812 --> 21:44.726
Eric, I'm so sorry about
What happened at the rally.

21:45.007 --> 21:48.510
It was like watching an antelope
Get taken down On "wild kingdom."

21:49.112 --> 21:51.190
This is permanent marker, Donna.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.837
I don't think this is coming off!
