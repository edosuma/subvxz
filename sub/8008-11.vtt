Cut it out! That's not helping her!

01:27.337 --> 01:29.339
But Mom and Dad always burped on us.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.716
It's a cure-all!

01:30.716 --> 01:33.344
Sorry, guys, there are no cure-alls.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.846
Your parents were just burping
on you for kicks.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.726
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.351
(BURPS) Oh, sorry, last one.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.603
Ugh! What did you eat, Jake?

01:42.728 --> 01:43.729
Hey! HOW!

01:43.812 --> 01:46.361
I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.482
Just kidding.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.109
Pride, hmm.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.115
Do you guys know what "hubris" is?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.492
It's like an old-timey deity

01:52.571 --> 01:54.118
who weighed your deeds on a scale.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.246
No, it means excessive pride or arrogance.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.123
That's like you, PB.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.500
- Dude.
- No, it's true.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.503
I believed in myself so much

02:03.498 --> 02:06.001
that I was blind
to the possible consequences.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.633
Don't believe in yourself
so much, then, dum-dum.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.391
Now my best friend is dying
of poison because of me.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.302
That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.388
And you helped her because you're her friend.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.807
Real friends take each other
to the edge of death...

02:20.182 --> 02:21.434

- Right, Finn?
- Shoot, yeah!

02:23.435 --> 02:25.403
I get poisoned all the time
just doing the dishes!

02:25.687 --> 02:28.315
I get poisoned on purpose, for research.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.693
I have a poison lab back at the castle.

Well, let's get our butts over there, then!

02:33.320 --> 02:36.199
Find the Moon, Finn.
We'll work on an antidote.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.454
You guys take her back to the poison lab.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.578
Maybe we can extract her healing powers.

EW, evvl evv,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.230
Sometimes I think vampires were invented

03:08.230 --> 03:09.356
just to torment me.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.983
Whoa. I don't think so, man.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.943
I think you might have a hubris.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.116
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

plopped out of her bod?

03:23.745 --> 03:24.997
I don't think so.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.625
it used to belong to that mummy job.

right out of her bod!

03:50.981 --> 03:52.528

05:04.012 --> 05:06.811
to stake her back,
instead of us taking her back.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.815
Wait. "Taking" or "staking"?

05:11.436 --> 05:16.192
She said, "You guys, 'sztake' her back."

05:16.316 --> 05:20.196
No, yeah!
She said, "You guys, take her back."

05:20.695 --> 05:22.072
So which one should we do?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.203

06:19.963 --> 06:21.260

06:21.339 --> 06:23.091

Okay, my life is in your hands, man!

06:32.350 --> 06:34.523
Hey. We're leading you to a trap.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.646
We're gonna suck out your
healing power and dust you.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.276

in a litter box.

a huge smelly tiger bomb

07:10.555 --> 07:12.432
And tubes... Where are your tubes?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.809
This process uses no tubes

07:14.935 --> 07:17.905
and involves no quantifiable measurements.

Mmm, video games?

08:20.458 --> 08:22.256
I don't like video games.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.378
Me neither.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.881
I don't even have a system
to play on or anything.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.133
I got a video game back at my place.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.264
But I just got it so I could stay in shape.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.683
How do you get in shape playing a game?

08:32.761 --> 08:35.059
Uh... It's like a yoga video.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.687
So it's not a game at all.

No, it is. It's a video game.
