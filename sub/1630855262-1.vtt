00:40.127 --> 00:43.521
Did I say you
could speak, weasel?

00:55.838 --> 00:58.145
Are you going to behave?

01:00.147 --> 01:01.974
I'm trying.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.937
Liar!

01:18.121 --> 01:21.342
Such a pity, Mr. Westley.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.735
If only you had to approve.

01:24.823 --> 01:27.957
Oh, you poor, pathetic man.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.136
Oh, nobody loves you.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.273
Time's up.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.625
Take it out!

01:43.668 --> 01:46.367
Ferry schedule,
leaving Staten Island.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.282
The next ferry
leaving from Manhattan terminal

01:48.325 --> 01:50.066
is in 20 minutes.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.901
Okay, get out, I have to go.

01:58.944 --> 01:59.815
- Wait.
- No.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.599
Please, just one more time.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.558
No way, Jose.

02:03.601 --> 02:07.257
Oh, my wife, she won't
do this for me, please.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.128
Oh.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.172
It's just--

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
I would love to
meet wife, man.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.132
Please, I really need it.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.307
No, but--

02:13.350 --> 02:14.743
You owe me another
50 for going over.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.483
Another 50?

02:15.526 --> 02:17.137
I already gave you $400.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.096
Hey, wait, wait, before you go
could you hit me in the face?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.402
Slap me real good.

02:21.445 --> 02:25.101
Hey, I gotta get to my
kid's recital, come...

02:25.145 --> 02:27.364
Please, let me out of this!

02:31.107 --> 02:33.022
A very good masochist.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.458
Awfully nice guy.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.720
Not creep.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.026

Aren't you a little old
to have the pink hair?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.438
Yeah, it's for a job.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.744
Ah, a job?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.093
Did you say a job?

11:58.543 --> 11:59.327
Oh, yes.

Hello, Jess.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.200
Hello, Irina.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.118
Where's Nathaniel?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.991
He has his closing
argument in the morning.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.994
Look at this.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.913
- Oh.
- Happy birthday, Dad.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.266
Um...

12:25.309 --> 12:27.181
no cameras, no cell
phones, no video.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.704
Hello?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.141
Which in your case
means, no life.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.279
Did you tell her?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.411
- I will tell her.
- Tell me what?

12:42.805 --> 12:45.373
We've put an offer
down on the house.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.896
A second house?

12:47.636 --> 12:49.116
It's upstate.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.900
Oh, where?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.554
Chappaqua.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.035
Like a vacation home?

12:55.078 --> 12:55.862
To live.

12:56.863 --> 12:57.733
That's like three hours away.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.039
You wanna move upstate?

12:59.082 --> 13:02.085
We wanna sell the apartment.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.131
What apartment?

13:04.174 --> 13:06.698
The one you're living in.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.397
Yeah.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.575
Can we back this up a second?

13:13.618 --> 13:15.403
I need to stop enabling you.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.100
- Enabling me?
- Yes.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.667
Can we table this for later?

13:18.710 --> 13:20.408
- My client is here.
- Oh.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.366
You just need
to get a real job

13:22.410 --> 13:23.977
and start paying real rent.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.674
Yeah, I would love to.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.545
But nobody can reasonably
afford to live here

13:27.589 --> 13:29.156
and still pursue their dreams.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.288
Maybe you need to
pursue another dream.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.160
Right?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.857
Toe tango?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.174
What?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.663
Yikes.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.974
Pretend like you really
like each other, okay?

14:48.017 --> 14:50.019
Stare into each other's
eyes, super lovey dovey.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.325
Feel up each other.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.414
How did I not
get into the top 10?

14:53.457 --> 14:55.459
Oh, who cares?

14:55.503 --> 14:58.114
Says a girl who makes all
her money off Live Hive.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.289
You're right, I do.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.856
Sorry, this last thing.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.075
I don't know if I should
do this job tomorrow.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.206
Can you come with me?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.729
I need a bodyguard.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.514
And it's not gonna be sketchy?

15:06.557 --> 15:07.950
It's outside.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.648
It's a public park, upstate.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.738
I will get our train
tickets with the $14

15:13.782 --> 15:15.827
that I made on monetization!

15:15.871 --> 15:17.090
$14.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.395
Okay, deal.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.354
But only if you film
me on the train.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.572
Will you do that?

15:21.616 --> 15:22.922
Yes.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.533
But if you ditch me
again, I'm doing it alone.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.666
And that is dangerous
'cause I could die.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.451
You could die.
Okay.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.979
I'm on my way
to meet Tom B.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.069
I'm going under the
name Lucy Byers,

15:40.113 --> 15:43.159
attractive female writer
for erotic thriller

15:43.203 --> 15:45.292

15:45.335 --> 15:47.294
Live inside the life of
my lead female character

15:47.337 --> 15:50.036
to help me write the
ending to my film.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.733
Writing experience is a must.

15:51.776 --> 15:55.476
Will pay $1500, $100
cash upon arrival.

15:56.694 --> 15:57.695
Girls only.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.872
Guaranteed 100 bucks.

16:00.916 --> 16:05.268
What do we think, shoes
will be staying on or off?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.069
Kai.

16:44.612 --> 16:45.656
Jess?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.006
Yes, Richard.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.877
Don't call me that.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.966
Are you recording me again?

16:51.010 --> 16:51.967
No.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.664
I told you not to record me.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.102
You're violating people's
rights without their permission.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.581
What don't you
understand about that?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.105
And you're not?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.107
Because you work for the
law, that entitles you

17:01.150 --> 17:03.413
to access hidden
cameras and IP addresses

17:03.457 --> 17:05.198
as, what, evidence?

17:05.241 --> 17:07.243
How's that any different?
I can sue you.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.811
Not that you're worth anything.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.379
- Yes, sue me for--
- Jess.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.685
You're driving us away.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.252
Dad.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.471
Jess?

17:17.514 --> 17:18.254
Hello?

17:18.298 --> 17:19.690
Hello?

17:40.929 --> 17:42.409
Okay, I've arrived.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.412
As you can see,
it's quite desolate.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.371
Pointing it, back.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.375
Just gonna have to
record you instead.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.943
Shit!

17:54.986 --> 17:56.684
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.642
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.774
It's okay.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.516
I'm Tom.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.736
- You're Tom?
- Yeah.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.216
Who were you talking to?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.044
Oh, nothing.

18:09.088 --> 18:09.958
I'm Je...

18:10.001 --> 18:11.177
Lucy.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.265
Hi, Je-Lucy.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.267
Lucy, sorry.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.659
- Nice to meet you.
- So frazzled.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.139
Yes, I could tell.

18:18.619 --> 18:19.924
Sorry, can you just
give me one second?

18:19.968 --> 18:21.230
I just need to finish.
Sure, take your time.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.798
Defrazzle, fine, no problem.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.064
- Okay, done.
- Cool.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.371
How are you?

18:31.414 --> 18:34.200
I'm, oh, I'm better now
that I found my co-writer.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.289
Do you wanna
talk about the job?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.159
Sure.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.508
- Cool.
- Yeah.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.467
- I'm sorry I startled you.
- It's okay.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.555
I got you.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.165
I'm sorry.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.340
Well, basically...

18:45.776 --> 18:46.734
Are you okay?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.170
Yeah, what's your accent?

18:48.214 --> 18:50.390
What do you think it is?

18:51.739 --> 18:52.827
British?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.176
- Ouch.
- It's Australian.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.787
- Thank you, thank you.
- Ah.

18:56.831 --> 18:57.788
It's offensive.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.226
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's good.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.141
Well, basically
it's all in the ad,

19:02.184 --> 19:04.317
but I really just want
somebody to help me

19:04.360 --> 19:06.536
come up with an
ending for my film.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.798
- Hitchcock.
- That's right.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.235
I've got the grunt of
the story work done,

19:09.278 --> 19:12.194
but I just need an ending
that does the story justice.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.152
Okay.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.153
Yeah, I can help you with that.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.197
Cool.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.634
You have a really good resume.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.245
- Oh, thank you, Tom.
- Very good.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.551
You'll have to bear with me
'cause I'm not as good as you.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.031
How did you get into writing?

19:23.074 --> 19:25.729
Ah, oh, it just
kind of happened.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.558
I was working as a writer
for the last couple years.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.820
Cool.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.823
Before that I was
trying to be an actor.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.129
Oh.

19:34.173 --> 19:34.912
Trying.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.175
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.307
Maybe you can be in this film.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.048
- Maybe?
- As an extra.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.136
- Yeah.
- If we can...

19:43.269 --> 19:44.357
Actually, I'd
be a great extra.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.097
I think you'd kill it.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.273
We can both be extras.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.188
- Glad that you're confident.
- Yeah.

19:49.666 --> 19:53.322
Yeah, how do you, did you
want me to write it myself?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.890
Oh no, I thought we
could do it together.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.152
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.285
Okay, yeah.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.591
Thou shall be done.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.506
What was your last name?

20:03.550 --> 20:04.333
Brady.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.161
Yes.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.206
- Tom Brady.
- Yes, Tom Brady.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.294
With the super soft hands.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.644
Yes, everybody says that.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.602
Well, everybody who
doesn't punch me.

20:12.646 --> 20:13.473
Yeah.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.518
So sorry to hear that.

20:17.912 --> 20:18.695
Cool.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.131
How do you wanna proceed?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.394
Do you send it to me, what
you've written so far?

20:21.437 --> 20:23.222
Do you have time now?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
- To read it?
- To work on it.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.050
Oh.

20:26.094 --> 20:26.964
Ah, oh.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.619
It'll only take 90 minutes.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.230
So.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.670
- You know that guy?
- Where did he come from?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.237
I have no idea.

20:39.847 --> 20:44.982
Did your ex follow you all
the way from New York City?

20:45.026 --> 20:46.593
He's taking the
break up really hard.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.639
Yes, huge fall from grace.

20:50.684 --> 20:51.989
Should we get going?

20:52.033 --> 20:52.947
Yeah, where are you--

20:52.990 --> 20:54.557
Well, I don't have my script,

20:54.601 --> 20:57.908
so we'll just go to my house,
grab it, continue our date.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.998
- Oh yeah, I have time.
- As promised.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.700
Did you say this was a date?

21:06.743 --> 21:09.442
I did, but then
I paid you money.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.226
- Right.
- So.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.141
It's a bit of a weird date.

21:13.184 --> 21:15.578
- It is, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

21:15.622 --> 21:16.492
- Okay.
- Shall we?

21:16.536 --> 21:18.146
Yeah, let's do it.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.978
Should I invite my ex?

21:24.021 --> 21:25.588
Nah, he's busy.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.211
So why a
script?

21:40.255 --> 21:41.561
Like why not a novel?

21:41.604 --> 21:44.564
Oh, novels are
just a bit passive.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.826
I wanted to...

21:47.654 --> 21:49.830
Well, I came up with this
killer concept for a film,

21:49.873 --> 21:52.093
and I thought, well, I want
to get it up on its feet,

21:52.136 --> 21:53.921
and really grind
it out, you know?

22:00.449 --> 22:02.146
This is way
further than I thought.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.323
Would you
mind if I smoked?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.630
Just a little bit?
Go for it, I don't care.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.110
Thank you.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.852
If there is a place to
smoke, it's out here.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.723
Look at it, beautiful.

22:21.862 --> 22:22.863
Mm.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.346
You want some?

22:31.088 --> 22:32.960
I don't usually smoke.

22:33.003 --> 22:33.787
No?

22:35.571 --> 22:38.052
It makes me paranoid.

22:40.663 --> 22:41.969
Did you hear that?

22:42.012 --> 22:43.536
You heard that?
I did.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.450
Watch out!

22:47.278 --> 22:49.411
Oh, the man-eating bunnies!

22:49.455 --> 22:51.674
The man-eating bunnies.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.981
- Well, that was good.
- Don't touch me.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.202
How much further we
got on this trail?

22:58.246 --> 22:59.160
Not long.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.429
Where are we?

23:10.780 --> 23:12.652
Is this where you live?

23:14.741 --> 23:16.830
Wait, you live in a barn?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.225
Oh, boy.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.367
Do you like living
all the way out here?

24:16.411 --> 24:17.847
I do.

24:17.891 --> 24:18.805
It's nice, it's quiet.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.197
It's private.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.243
Nobody can see you.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.550
Just me and my little
purr ball, Milo.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.204
You have a cat?

24:27.248 --> 24:29.293
No, I don't.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.643
But I want one, I
want heaps of 'em.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.253
I got mice.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.602
Ah.

24:33.646 --> 24:34.690
I have a cat.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.170
You could borrow mine.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.954
What kind of cat have you got?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.956
A gray kind.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.699
Could you untangle
this for me?

24:43.743 --> 24:47.181
I spend so long untangling
these bloody things.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.051
Yeah.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.271
I have the same problem.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.447
I probably lose four
minutes every day,

24:52.491 --> 24:56.538
which probably amounts to
eight years off my life.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.065
You play piano?

25:02.109 --> 25:03.153
Nope.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.899
Do you mind if I play?

25:09.943 --> 25:12.685
Of course, go for it.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.861
I'm just printing the script.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.618
You're quite good.
Ah, geez.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.272
Can I sit here?

27:02.316 --> 27:04.927
Where'd you learn to do that?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.625
Ah, my mom taught me.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.757
- Huh?
- When I was six.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.151
She was an amazing pianist.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.414
That's an interesting
thing to say about your mom.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.982
She was an amazing penis?

27:16.025 --> 27:17.331
Oh.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.289
That's so ridiculous.

27:23.598 --> 27:26.645
You know, you are much
prettier than your picture.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.909
- What picture?
- The one in your email.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.128
What?

27:32.172 --> 27:33.782
No way, that's an
amazing picture.

27:33.826 --> 27:34.740
Hmm?

27:34.783 --> 27:36.350
1500 likes on it on Facebook.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.568
Oh, well, wow.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.700
Shouldn't have said anything.

27:38.744 --> 27:39.658
1500 likes on Facebook.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.137
Wow, incredible.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.791
What's wrong
with that picture?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.227
It's not who you are.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.881
Because you know who I am.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.187
I have an idea.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.410
- It's glamorous.
- It's phony.

27:53.454 --> 27:54.324
It's phony.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.978
You are not phony.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.720
It diminishes your intelligence.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.549
It looks like your name
might be like Kandi with a K.

28:01.592 --> 28:02.637
Okay.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.335
Get lost.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.731
What do you do for work?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.254
I know you're trying
to be a writer,

28:11.298 --> 28:13.779
but what do you do
to afford all this?

28:13.822 --> 28:18.131
I'm a trapeze
artist.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.263
Oh my God.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.704
One thing you should
know about me, Luce,

28:25.747 --> 28:26.966
I like to have fun.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.097
I don't like to take
things very seriously.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.273
I don't take my
career very seriously.

28:30.317 --> 28:33.015
And I don't take
money very seriously.

28:33.059 --> 28:35.670
Says people with money.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.019
Would it change
your perception of me

28:37.063 --> 28:38.934
if you knew I was rich?

28:42.111 --> 28:44.244
- No.
- Aw, that's a shame.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.160
I'm an old romantic.

28:48.335 --> 28:51.251
Can I use your restroom?

28:51.294 --> 28:52.382
About that.

28:55.908 --> 28:57.431
I have an outhouse.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.303
- No, you don't.
- I live in a barn.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.130
Sorry.

29:02.392 --> 29:05.221
Who doesn't
have a real bathroom?

29:10.139 --> 29:13.403
Are you kidding
me with this shit?

29:13.447 --> 29:16.798
Oh, it's so creepy.

29:16.842 --> 29:17.625
Yuck.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.369
Ah!

29:22.848 --> 29:24.197
Not going to that.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.113
Oh!

29:30.377 --> 29:32.335
Hey guys, oh my God.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.250
I'm so sorry, my
live feed cut out.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.252
The service out here
is super shoddy.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.906
Anyway, I am recording it also.

29:37.950 --> 29:41.431
I'm gonna upload an episode
for all of you later tonight.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.868
I'm at...

29:42.911 --> 29:43.738
No, no.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.610
Ah!

29:46.654 --> 29:47.437
Why?

29:49.048 --> 29:50.005
Crap.

29:51.267 --> 29:55.358
Okay, so back to recording.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.186
Right there.

29:57.230 --> 30:01.930
So I'm at Tom B's, and we are
about to write the script.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.410
I don't know, it seems legit.

30:03.453 --> 30:06.369
Something is
definitely off though.

30:07.196 --> 30:10.852
He's also surprisingly
good looking.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.898
Oh, I did make 100 bucks.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.421
He actually paid.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.553
Wait, where did I put it?

30:19.252 --> 30:20.166
Ah.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.255
Ah, shit!

30:23.125 --> 30:25.649
No!

30:33.832 --> 30:35.137
Kandi with a K.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.620
Jesus!

30:39.663 --> 30:41.056
Holy shit.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.908
Oh.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.779
Really?

31:08.823 --> 31:09.955
Where's the script?

31:09.998 --> 31:10.956
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.392
Shut up.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.828
- What happened to your hair?
- What's your wifi?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.351
Why is your hair
all standing up?

31:15.395 --> 31:16.526
What's wrong with my hair?

31:16.570 --> 31:18.746
Your hair's all
standing up, isn't it?

31:18.789 --> 31:22.054
- Leave it.
- Okay, fine, I'll leave it.

31:23.925 --> 31:24.708
Why?

31:26.145 --> 31:27.494
Who cares?

31:28.799 --> 31:31.237
I don't kiss on the first date.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.630
Guess what?

31:33.674 --> 31:34.762
What?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.068
Neither do I.

31:47.731 --> 31:48.863
Okay.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.912
Sorry.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.131
That's okay.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.568
Sorry.
Woo!

32:01.354 --> 32:02.137
What?

32:03.530 --> 32:06.011
You sound like
such an American.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.448
Yeah, well, I guess...

32:08.491 --> 32:09.275
Oh!

32:10.711 --> 32:12.539
You're rubbing off on me.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.158
It is too bad about
our rule, Ms. Byers.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.073
- It is, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.553
Mr. Brady.

32:30.470 --> 32:31.558
What is this?

32:42.003 --> 32:43.309
You're trouble.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.137
- Oh, I'm trouble?
- Mm-hmm.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.009
Where are you going?
I don't wanna trouble you.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.796
I like when you trouble me.

32:54.146 --> 32:54.755
This is a bad idea.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.322
Why?

32:56.365 --> 32:59.020
I just don't want it to get
in the way of our writing.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.718
It could make it
more it more fun.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.028
What the hell is that?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.116
I don't know.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.560
Will you check that?

33:25.438 --> 33:27.222
I'm just gonna close this.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.244
Gotta keep those bunnies out.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.205
Are you okay?

33:59.254 --> 34:01.343
I'm gonna get the script.

34:04.346 --> 34:05.130
Great.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.786
Oh my God.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.224
Get yourself together, Jess.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.767
Ooh, scary.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.683
Okay, give me.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.599
So, just a little backstory
before you read this.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.166
It's a two-person script.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.776
The main character is fleshed
out for the most part.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.734
The secondary character
is what I need help with.

34:44.778 --> 34:48.216
I really want this to feel
like it's actually happening.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.262
Okay, excited to read it.

34:50.305 --> 34:51.567
What kind of story is it?

34:51.611 --> 34:53.134
It's a psychological thriller.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.440
I haven't written any dialogue.

34:54.483 --> 34:58.139
I've been waiting for
the right voice clearly.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.794
You want me to read now or
wait till we go somewhere?

35:00.837 --> 35:01.795
You're cute.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.101
Okay.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.190
Just 'cause we almost
skipped to third base,

35:05.233 --> 35:06.234
doesn't mean that
you're off the hook

35:06.278 --> 35:09.542
and don't still owe me a dinner.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.674
Owe you dinner, really?

35:17.506 --> 35:18.333
Okay.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.511
"Classified Killer," shocking.

35:33.566 --> 35:36.264
Fade in, exterior park, day.

35:36.308 --> 35:40.312
Jess, 27, is one of those
beautiful but interchangeable

35:40.355 --> 35:41.661
American girls.

35:41.704 --> 35:45.665
A bit sure of herself and
yet somehow still angry.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.978
She sits consumed by
her absent photos,

35:55.022 --> 35:57.764
obsessed with selling
herself for clicks,

35:57.807 --> 35:58.982
fixing her hair and pretending

35:59.026 --> 36:02.682
to be far more
comfortable in this world.

36:02.725 --> 36:06.686
Tom approaches, an Australian
man, tall and charming.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.078
You're Tom?

36:08.122 --> 36:10.690
I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to startle you.

36:10.733 --> 36:11.865
I'm so sorry.

36:15.912 --> 36:19.089
Do
you mind if I play?

36:21.788 --> 36:23.224
Can I use your restroom?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.270
I have an outhouse.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.710
Just gonna close this.

36:30.753 --> 36:33.060
Gotta keep those bunnies out.

36:41.286 --> 36:45.246
If her
character dies, she dies.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.045
Cute.
You like it?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.612
I bluffed his age a little bit.

37:03.656 --> 37:06.180
I'm yet to add the bit about
almost kissing on the piano.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.529
I thought that was rich.

37:07.573 --> 37:08.922
I think that'll really
push the audience

37:08.965 --> 37:10.271
to root for their relationship.

37:10.315 --> 37:13.013
Or at least just wanna
see 'em fuck, you know?

37:13.056 --> 37:14.362
What do you think?

37:18.061 --> 37:20.194
What do I think?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.543
It's three pages.

37:21.587 --> 37:22.501
To start.

37:23.806 --> 37:24.590
Right.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.767
Yeah.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.073
You don't like it?

37:31.205 --> 37:32.728
It's good.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.687
Ah, you're lying.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.777
Yeah, well, it's
pretty fucking creepy,

37:37.820 --> 37:38.865
but it's interesting.

37:38.908 --> 37:39.953
Should we go?

37:39.996 --> 37:41.563
What do you think
about the title?

37:41.607 --> 37:44.740
I like it 'cause it implies
like one of us is the killer.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.047
You know, like one
of us kills people.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.918
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah, but who?

37:48.962 --> 37:50.659
- You clearly.
- That's rude, isn't it?

37:50.703 --> 37:52.270
You wrote, "Jess is
trapped in your house."

37:52.313 --> 37:53.706
His house.

37:53.749 --> 37:57.318
What if, what if it is
revealed Jess exposes parts

37:57.362 --> 38:00.756
of herself that makes her out
to conclusively be the killer?

38:00.800 --> 38:02.018
Bam!

38:02.062 --> 38:04.282
Completely takes the
audience by surprise.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.935
What do you think?

38:06.980 --> 38:09.112
Fine, Jess is the killer.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.332
You can't have a male
killer these days anyway.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.420
Why?

38:13.552 --> 38:15.075
It's too predictable.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.990
Man lures woman back to his
house and tries to kill her?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.079
Like we haven't seen that a
thousand times.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.080
Huh.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.125
Huh, I hadn't thought of that.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.910
Of course, you hadn't.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.259
Let's go.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.913
Before we go, what do
you think of the idea

38:26.956 --> 38:29.350
of creating the
story through improv?

38:29.394 --> 38:30.830
Huh?

38:30.873 --> 38:33.876
I think it would be so
much fun to create the ending

38:33.920 --> 38:35.138
through improvisation.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.489
You know, really beat
out the second act.

38:37.532 --> 38:40.753
I'll be the main character,
you be Jess, huh?

38:40.796 --> 38:43.625
Just get it up on its feet
like we've been doing.

38:43.669 --> 38:47.977
You know, I too once
dreamed of been an actor.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.675
Ah, sure, that can work.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.111
Let's improvise in the park.
Stay with me here.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.069
'Cause I really wanna
pretend to be these people.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.158
I wanna live inside the
heads of these characters.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.204
I think, as far
as intentions go,

38:57.247 --> 38:59.380
Tom's intentions are clear.
Are they?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.164
It's Jess that
I've been stuck on.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.949
What does Jess want?

39:02.992 --> 39:04.690
What does Tom want?

39:04.733 --> 39:06.474
I can't tell you
that, you minx.

39:06.518 --> 39:07.736
How about this?

39:07.780 --> 39:09.651
You come up with your intention,

39:09.695 --> 39:12.393
and then we'll improvise,
see how it pans out.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.613
Who survives?

39:16.528 --> 39:19.618
What do you think
about that, Jess?

39:19.661 --> 39:21.402
Do you like the name Jess?

39:21.446 --> 39:22.621
Uh-huh.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.406
Tom and Jess, it's
like Tom and Jerry.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.409
Except I'd never
torment you that much.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.110
Yeah, I need some air.

39:39.289 --> 39:40.073
What?

40:08.710 --> 40:10.059
The windows are all boarded?

40:10.103 --> 40:12.497
Why are your windows
all boarded?

40:12.540 --> 40:13.759
It's a barn.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.111
I need to make a call.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.243
Do you have service?

40:20.287 --> 40:21.419
Yeah.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.333
- Can I use your phone?
- Of course.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.945
Sorry, I'm not freaking
you out too much, am I?

40:25.988 --> 40:27.555
- Yeah.
- I'm just having fun.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.078
You know, I wrote the script

40:29.122 --> 40:30.993
while you were
playing the piano.

40:31.037 --> 40:34.562
Seriously, while you were
playing so beautifully,

40:34.606 --> 40:38.697
I just thought,
"This is perfect."

40:38.740 --> 40:40.481
I think it would be so
much fun to really live

40:40.525 --> 40:41.613
inside these characters' heads.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.137
Just really start
to understand them.

40:44.180 --> 40:48.141
While you were playing,
I was like, "Oh, yes."

40:48.184 --> 40:51.710
This is like an onion, there
are so many layers to unravel.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.494
I'm like an onion?

40:53.538 --> 40:55.278
What are you?

40:55.322 --> 40:57.237
I'm like a, like a walnut.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.935
I'm delicious and hard.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.244
How about this?

41:04.287 --> 41:06.594
You come up with the
next part of the script,

41:06.638 --> 41:09.249
I'll give you another 100 bucks?

41:14.733 --> 41:15.908
Great, okay, let's review.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.997
So we've started
writing the script.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.825
We've established the
female is the killer.

41:19.868 --> 41:21.522
I love that, okay.

41:21.566 --> 41:22.871
We need something
big to happen now

41:22.915 --> 41:25.483
'cause I feel like the
audience is getting bored.

41:25.526 --> 41:28.094
What do you think, Ms. Byers?

41:28.137 --> 41:31.227
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, I'm paying you.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.493
Jess turns into a vampire.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.974
What, sci-fi thriller,
they're all the rage.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.062
Cute.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.587
How about this?

41:43.892 --> 41:46.025
Everything is better
when the lights are out.

41:46.068 --> 41:46.939
Holy shit.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.027
Okay, yeah.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.594
You can turn the
lights back on now.

41:49.637 --> 41:51.987
Oh, but how are we
gonna create the right ambiance?

41:52.031 --> 41:55.338
We're trying to write
an award-winning script.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.166
Yes, super creepy.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.428
Tom, fuck off!

41:58.472 --> 41:59.255
Don't!

42:00.561 --> 42:02.607
At least turn off the
music, it's really loud.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.435
No, don't fucking!

42:07.612 --> 42:11.398
Oh, this definitely
needs to be in the film.

42:11.441 --> 42:13.313
- Don't, don't!
- Woo!

42:13.356 --> 42:14.227
Don't, please.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.098
Oh, don't please.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.099
Oh, you
like it, don't you?

42:17.143 --> 42:18.623
No.

42:18.666 --> 42:19.928
No, I don't.

42:19.972 --> 42:20.886
I feel like
you're the kind of person

42:20.929 --> 42:23.497
who likes being scared.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.194
Yeah, what
tells you that?

42:25.238 --> 42:27.109
You've come back
to a stranger's house

42:27.153 --> 42:28.502
in the middle of nowhere.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.549
Did you know when
a person is scared

42:33.246 --> 42:34.987
they release endorphins.

42:35.030 --> 42:38.904
The same hormones they
release when they're aroused.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.209
That's why you
wrote a scary movie,

42:40.253 --> 42:43.212
so I'd get aroused by
it and sleep with you?

42:43.256 --> 42:45.606
Ah, that is
so fucking boring!

42:45.650 --> 42:48.043
My character needs a challenge!

42:50.655 --> 42:52.570
Tom, are you okay?

42:52.613 --> 42:55.181
Do not fuck with me about this.

42:55.224 --> 42:56.399
Tom.

42:57.618 --> 42:58.445
Tom?

43:08.629 --> 43:09.412
Hey.

43:12.111 --> 43:13.155
Hey.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.202
Hey.

43:16.245 --> 43:17.029
Hey.

43:18.770 --> 43:19.597
Hey.

43:22.469 --> 43:23.252
You okay?

43:24.645 --> 43:25.690
Yeah, fine.

43:28.040 --> 43:28.954
I'm fine.

43:28.997 --> 43:31.130
Oh, I fucking hated that.

43:33.175 --> 43:35.874
I was just having fun.

43:35.917 --> 43:37.310
Yeah, so fun.

43:39.268 --> 43:40.182
I gotta go.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.768
Maybe we can meet tomorrow.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.466
I can't tomorrow.

44:05.207 --> 44:06.687
Next week then.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.211
Tied up next week.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.783
Oh, the extra 100 bucks.

44:17.045 --> 44:18.960
For your next bit.

44:29.710 --> 44:31.973
It's all about the money.

44:43.071 --> 44:44.029
Thanks.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.787
You just gonna let me go?

45:04.179 --> 45:06.268
You gotta get to your cat.

45:09.445 --> 45:11.273
You didn't even try.

45:14.276 --> 45:16.931
What happened to
being an old romantic?

45:16.975 --> 45:19.760
Don't even offer
the lady a drink?

45:21.370 --> 45:24.156
You send a lot
of mixed signals.

45:24.199 --> 45:26.811
Yeah, you like that though?

45:26.854 --> 45:28.856
One drink, then I'll go.

45:31.206 --> 45:35.123
Ah, yeah, that is it.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.124
Come on.

45:40.563 --> 45:41.347
Come on.

45:47.092 --> 45:49.224
Boom, there it is again.

45:49.268 --> 45:50.182
Downtown.

45:50.225 --> 45:52.097
Come on, dance with me.

45:52.140 --> 45:52.967
Come on.

45:53.011 --> 45:54.142
Let's boogie.

45:54.186 --> 45:54.882
You're not writing
a romantic comedy.

45:54.926 --> 45:56.014
Shush up.

45:56.057 --> 45:57.363
It's the point of
living off the grid.

45:57.406 --> 46:00.714
You can just let
loose and be yourself.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.630
Oh, that's it, that's it.

46:03.673 --> 46:05.197
Undo all that, loosen up.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.067
Oh, shh, oh, that's it.

46:06.111 --> 46:07.242
Loosen it up.

46:07.286 --> 46:08.591
Come over here.

46:09.592 --> 46:11.290
Get on it, come on.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.117
Get on it.

46:16.643 --> 46:17.426
Woo!

46:30.178 --> 46:31.266
Okay.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.311
See you tomorrow.

46:32.354 --> 46:33.834
Yeah, when you
wake up in my bed.

46:33.878 --> 46:36.097
Ah.

46:41.407 --> 46:43.713
- What, what?
- I need...

46:43.757 --> 46:44.845
I need my carrot.

46:44.889 --> 46:47.021
At least the
speakers will survive.

46:51.634 --> 46:53.027
Where are we going?

46:53.071 --> 46:53.854
Where are we going?

46:53.898 --> 46:55.247
To the bed, baby.

47:24.929 --> 47:25.973
What is that?

47:26.017 --> 47:27.801
What, what?

47:27.845 --> 47:28.628
No.

47:30.108 --> 47:31.892
- Oh my God.
- What is this?

47:31.936 --> 47:32.893
It's just extensions.

47:32.937 --> 47:33.676
Extensions?

47:33.720 --> 47:35.069
What, like fake hair?

47:35.113 --> 47:36.114
No, it's not fake hair.

47:36.157 --> 47:38.507
It's real, it's
just not my hair.

47:39.944 --> 47:41.946
You have somebody
else's hair on your head?

47:41.989 --> 47:42.990
No.

47:43.034 --> 47:44.122
Sort of.

47:44.165 --> 47:45.601
Oh my God.
Can you take it out?

47:45.645 --> 47:46.646
What, now?

47:46.689 --> 47:47.560
Yeah.

47:47.603 --> 47:48.822
- No, they're--
- Why?

47:48.866 --> 47:50.737
Oh, they're like woven in.

47:50.780 --> 47:52.782
Oh.

47:52.826 --> 47:54.959
Well, is there anything
else on you that isn't real?

47:58.005 --> 48:00.921
Maybe like these things, huh?

48:00.965 --> 48:02.923
- Fuck off!
- Oh!

48:02.967 --> 48:05.012
What are you gonna do about it?

48:05.795 --> 48:07.623
You know what I want?

48:07.667 --> 48:08.929
I want this.

48:08.973 --> 48:11.192
- Yeah, you do.
- I'm hungry for it.

48:11.236 --> 48:12.019
Yes.

48:14.021 --> 48:15.849
Get these going.

48:17.111 --> 48:19.244
Get these off.

48:19.287 --> 48:20.419
Easy.

48:20.462 --> 48:22.638
Easy, no.

48:32.387 --> 48:33.649
All right.

48:33.693 --> 48:36.130
Oh, gosh, what's
happening now?

48:36.174 --> 48:37.479
Oh, shut up.

48:37.523 --> 48:38.524
Oh, no.

48:39.612 --> 48:41.048
Oh, gosh.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.616
What are you gonna do now?

48:43.659 --> 48:45.835
Where are your ropes?

48:45.879 --> 48:47.011
My ropes?

48:47.054 --> 48:49.100
Yeah, your ropes.

48:49.143 --> 48:51.189
How did you know I had ropes?

48:51.232 --> 48:53.408
I saw them in your
video, Toe Tango.

48:53.452 --> 48:55.019
I don't know if I trust you.

48:55.062 --> 48:59.806
Well, you don't have to trust
me, but you will thank me.

49:02.765 --> 49:03.766
Whew.

49:07.727 --> 49:09.685
All right, take this off.

49:09.729 --> 49:10.991
Take it off.

49:11.035 --> 49:12.253
Are you lying?

49:12.297 --> 49:13.124
No.

49:34.275 --> 49:35.276
Got 'em.

49:36.756 --> 49:37.713
Here?

49:39.106 --> 49:40.107
Oh.

49:40.716 --> 49:42.414
Oh gosh, kinky.
Shh!

49:45.721 --> 49:48.376
Did you want to
tie an actual knot?

49:48.420 --> 49:49.943
Because I'm assuming
you want to tie--

49:49.987 --> 49:51.249
I know how to tie knots,
thanks.

49:51.292 --> 49:53.729
Do you really though
because this doesn't--

49:53.773 --> 49:55.818
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

49:55.862 --> 49:56.732
Fine.

49:58.517 --> 50:00.432
Oh yeah, get this side.

50:01.302 --> 50:04.044
Have you ever heard
of capture bonding?

50:04.088 --> 50:07.482
It's when people are sexually
attracted to their captors.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.267
It's a fetish.

50:09.310 --> 50:10.746
Hmm.

50:10.790 --> 50:12.705
What about the captor being
attracted to the captive?

50:12.748 --> 50:15.229
I bet you're captivated by that.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.404
Maybe I am.

50:23.281 --> 50:24.760
Mm, oh gosh.

50:26.545 --> 50:28.547
Do you
have any fetishes?

50:28.590 --> 50:29.765
Do you?

50:29.809 --> 50:31.158
I ask the questions.

50:31.202 --> 50:32.899
Okay.

50:32.942 --> 50:38.687
This is the part in the script
where Tom reveals himself.

50:39.558 --> 50:41.777
- Oh, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

50:44.345 --> 50:45.346
Uh-huh.

50:45.390 --> 50:46.826
If he doesn't,

50:47.522 --> 50:51.657
he will be tortured

50:52.527 --> 50:55.356
by the tickle monster.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.837
No, no, ah!

50:57.880 --> 50:58.925
No!

50:58.968 --> 51:01.188
Ah!

51:02.102 --> 51:05.018
Seriously, you said
you wanted to improvise.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.672
Let's play a game.

51:07.716 --> 51:12.678
I'll ask you questions, and
if you answer truthfully,

51:13.418 --> 51:15.115
you will be rewarded.

51:17.161 --> 51:21.121
If you lie, you
will be punished.

51:21.165 --> 51:23.297
Ah, no, ah!

51:23.341 --> 51:25.560
- You're so ticklish.
- Ah!

51:27.736 --> 51:29.390
I like this game.

51:29.434 --> 51:31.305
Okay, first question.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.180
Is Tom your real name?

51:36.223 --> 51:37.050
Yes.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.014
So impatient.

51:48.235 --> 51:50.063
Where's your family?

51:51.369 --> 51:52.152
Dead.

51:55.024 --> 51:57.897
You're lying.

51:59.203 --> 52:01.814
They're in Australia.

52:01.857 --> 52:04.686
What, do you wanna
see my passport?

52:04.730 --> 52:05.948
Foot in mouth!

52:13.217 --> 52:17.177
Have you ever lured a woman
home to have sex with you?

52:17.221 --> 52:19.832
Oh, of course I have.

52:19.875 --> 52:21.312
I am a human.

52:21.355 --> 52:22.965
But I didn't lure her.

52:23.009 --> 52:25.011
She mutually consented
to making love to me,

52:25.054 --> 52:28.319
and she mutually
consented to coming.

52:30.277 --> 52:31.800
Toe in mouth now.

52:40.679 --> 52:42.202
Why do you live
all the way out here?

52:42.246 --> 52:44.378
So nobody can hear you.

52:45.379 --> 52:46.685
I can't tell with you.

52:46.728 --> 52:49.035
That would ruin the game.

52:49.949 --> 52:51.994
Where are the scars from?

52:52.038 --> 52:54.127
Was a...

52:55.128 --> 52:56.521
cooking accident.

52:58.262 --> 52:59.393
No, okay!

52:59.437 --> 53:01.134
Okay, okay!

53:01.178 --> 53:02.048
- You're lying.
- Isn't it obvious?

53:02.091 --> 53:05.617
Actually, I don't really know.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.314
You don't know
how you got burned?

53:07.358 --> 53:08.315
Okay.

53:08.359 --> 53:10.099
Okay, fine, okay!
Stop lying!

53:11.275 --> 53:12.711
No, no!

53:12.754 --> 53:15.192
Okay, I'll fucking tell you.

53:18.325 --> 53:22.851
When I was five, there
was a fire in my house.

53:24.810 --> 53:27.726
And I was there, but I got out.

53:32.905 --> 53:34.254
But my mom died.

53:39.172 --> 53:40.434
Is that true?

53:41.392 --> 53:42.523
You tell me.

53:43.611 --> 53:46.005
God, you're too
good at this game.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.747
Hmm.

53:54.143 --> 53:56.494
Did you know my mom died?

53:56.537 --> 53:57.321
No.

53:58.539 --> 54:00.976
Did you know her name?

54:01.020 --> 54:02.195
No.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.067
But you know my cat's name.

54:05.111 --> 54:08.157
- You told me.
- I didn't tell you.

54:08.201 --> 54:10.029
You didn't tell me.

54:10.072 --> 54:13.119
What else do
you know about me?

54:13.162 --> 54:17.166
I know more about you
than you know about you.

54:20.474 --> 54:22.650
Can you untie me now?
I'm going home.

54:22.694 --> 54:24.086
What, now?

54:24.130 --> 54:25.174
Mm-hmm.

54:26.524 --> 54:27.829
But, but what about
me, how will I survive?

54:27.873 --> 54:29.440
I'm tied up here.

54:29.483 --> 54:32.181
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

54:32.225 --> 54:34.271
But you don't
know the way home.

54:34.314 --> 54:36.055
I'll follow the breadcrumbs.

54:36.098 --> 54:38.884
What if the real killer
is out there in the woods?

54:38.927 --> 54:40.755
I'll take my chances.

54:42.191 --> 54:44.019
Give you some time to
reconsider your intentions,

54:44.063 --> 54:45.891
you sick fuck!

54:45.934 --> 54:47.980
Oh, well that's not very nice.

54:50.374 --> 54:53.115
Wait, are you actually leaving?

54:55.596 --> 54:58.469
Killer in the
woods, I like that.

55:01.036 --> 55:03.169
I'd be careful if
I were you, Tom.

55:03.212 --> 55:05.780
We already decided who
the real killer is.

55:12.787 --> 55:14.223
Okay!

55:14.267 --> 55:16.574
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

55:16.617 --> 55:18.967
I saw your web series.

55:19.011 --> 55:20.534
Can you blame me?

55:22.188 --> 55:23.450
It's kind of hard to miss,

55:23.494 --> 55:26.105
and you weren't exactly
offering any truth.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.374
Okay, fine, clearly
I'm the antagonist.

55:39.379 --> 55:43.252
Good luck getting
out, Barbie Girl.

56:04.883 --> 56:05.666
No!

56:06.450 --> 56:07.364
Come on.

56:09.017 --> 56:10.062
Ah!

56:21.334 --> 56:22.466
Three.

56:23.554 --> 56:24.381
Two.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.034
One.

56:27.122 --> 56:28.210
Here I come.

56:34.216 --> 56:36.654
I told you you
didn't tie it right.

56:40.484 --> 56:41.659
Don't come any closer.

56:41.702 --> 56:42.790
Or what?

56:42.834 --> 56:45.619
Or I smash your
signal blocker.

56:45.663 --> 56:49.057
Yeah, I know what
this is, you lunatic.

56:50.015 --> 56:51.190
Shit!

56:51.233 --> 56:52.626
Shit.

57:09.164 --> 57:10.122
Stop.

57:11.253 --> 57:14.213
Stop!

57:18.391 --> 57:19.261
What now?

57:19.305 --> 57:21.307
Dad, I need your help.

57:21.350 --> 57:22.874
Jess.

57:22.917 --> 57:24.266
Jess, I'm not gonna give
you another lecture.

57:24.310 --> 57:25.964
So you can put me in
another episode.

57:26.007 --> 57:27.182
No, no, no, no, I'm
not messing with you.

57:27.226 --> 57:28.314
I swear.

57:32.231 --> 57:33.537
No, no, no!

57:33.580 --> 57:34.581
No, come on!

57:41.893 --> 57:43.982
Oh, please, I'm begging you.

57:44.025 --> 57:45.200
I'll just, I'll go.

57:45.244 --> 57:46.332
I won't even tell
anyone that I was here.

57:46.375 --> 57:47.464
I don't even know
anything about you.

57:47.507 --> 57:48.682
I just, I don't wanna die today.

57:48.726 --> 57:50.118
I can't die.

57:50.162 --> 57:54.122
What if, part of you had
to die, in order to live?

57:54.166 --> 57:55.210
No, no, no.

57:55.254 --> 57:58.126
Tom, stop!

57:59.258 --> 58:02.566
Tell me, why
shouldn't you die?

58:04.176 --> 58:06.221
Your character I mean?

58:08.267 --> 58:09.834
Because it's...

58:11.749 --> 58:13.490
It's just another story.

58:14.186 --> 58:16.449
The script, you said it...

58:16.493 --> 58:18.059
Go on.

58:18.103 --> 58:20.671
The, the, the char--

58:22.411 --> 58:24.544
Just, you need to
change location.

58:24.588 --> 58:27.460
You said you didn't want
your audience to get bored.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.375
You can't stay inside
a whole film.

58:30.245 --> 58:31.508
Ah.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.424
No, I do like the
idea that you get out.

58:35.468 --> 58:37.339
But where will you go?

58:37.383 --> 58:38.558
I will go home.

58:38.602 --> 58:40.038
I'll go home.

58:40.081 --> 58:44.085
I'll hide in the woods until
I know you can't find me.

58:44.129 --> 58:45.826
I'll be like, I'll be
like the protagonist

58:45.870 --> 58:47.524
that's always trying
to track you down.

58:47.567 --> 58:48.699
What if, what if, what
if, what if, what if?

58:48.742 --> 58:50.004
What if?

58:50.048 --> 58:52.746
What if you go home,
and when you get there,

58:52.790 --> 58:54.531
and I'm already there.

58:55.706 --> 58:59.361
And you go to your
window and open it.

58:59.405 --> 59:04.323
And I'll be on the sidewalk
across from the organic market.

59:04.889 --> 59:05.890
Oh goddamn it.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.108
Tom, stop fucking with me!

59:07.152 --> 59:10.155
You fuck with
people all the time!

59:32.873 --> 59:35.006
Good luck on your escape.

59:38.662 --> 59:39.706
Go on.

59:42.579 --> 59:45.756
I'll do the slow
walk after you leave.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.130
Stop, stop!

01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:59.656
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:22.069
Beautiful.

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:24.985
You look like Karl Lagerfeld.

01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.986
Boop.

01:01:27.074 --> 01:01:28.119
Okay.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:32.732
Jess tries escaping
into the woods.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:39.913
Too bad she's too slow
because of her enormous ass!

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:43.090
Oh, come on, laugh a little.

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:45.266
All good horrors have comedy.

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.312
So you're pretending
to be American now.

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:49.836
See, this scene, too shaky.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.142
Might need to redo it.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:53.100
But look, look at this.

01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:54.841
This turned out great.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:57.888
Have you ever
heard of capture bonding?

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.194
Some people are sexually
attracted to their captors.

01:02:00.238 --> 01:02:01.718
It's a fetish.

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.458
What about the captor being
attracted to the captive?

01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:05.286
I bet you're
captivated by that?

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:06.244
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.550
Did you not know I was filming?

01:02:08.594 --> 01:02:10.030
Silly me.

01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:12.163
I'm not even the expert
on hidden cameras.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:13.033
Yeah, I knew you were filming,

01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.426
you misogynistic prick.

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:15.993
No, misogynists hate women.

01:02:16.036 --> 01:02:17.516
I don't hate women.

01:02:17.559 --> 01:02:18.952
I just hate you.

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:25.306
Did you know, that I knew,
that you were filming me?

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.525
Great placement.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.309
I mean, the glasses
on the table.

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:29.789
Oh, great, very central.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.052
Oh, and the little pin
above the fireplace.

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:34.925
Subtle because people just
always take their little pins

01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:36.753
and put it above fireplaces.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:40.582
Really good, genius.

01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.071
Who was in the woods?

01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:53.726
You know, I actually
thought to myself,

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.120
if she goes anywhere
off the beaten path,

01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:57.817
I'm gonna let her go.

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:01.778
Oh, I'm sorry, am I boring you?

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.263
How long
is this screen test?

01:03:09.307 --> 01:03:11.091
This is great content.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:12.223
Really good.

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.664
Stop.

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:20.448
Okay, okay!

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:23.843
Oh, oh!

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:26.715
- Are you ready?
- To be tortured?

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:28.108
Hashtag relatable.

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.415
What is it?

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.633
What'd you put on my eyes?

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:32.983
What'd you put on my eyes?

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:35.681
Can you
take if off my eyes?

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:37.204
Take it off my eyes right
not, you son of a bitch!

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:38.815
Right here.

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:42.079
This.

01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:51.915
Flubbed this part, didn't you?

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.048
At what point after you
realized that Bryan's face

01:03:55.092 --> 01:03:59.096
was exposed did you decide
to keep the video up?

01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:01.533
I didn't know.

01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:07.147
100% bullshit!

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:13.806
Wasn't that you didn't know,
it's just that you didn't care.

01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:19.203
What's your password?

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:21.118
I'm not giving
you my password.

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:26.863
Your password or die.

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:35.741
F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.

01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:41.573
B-A-R-B-I-E, star,
dollar sign, enter.

01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:46.752
Let me ask once more.

01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:49.450
At what point after you
realized that Brian's face

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:52.410
was exposed did you decide
to keep the video up?

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:53.846
I didn't know.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.023
Oh fuck, ah!

01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:59.504
God, it's really woven
in there, isn't it?

01:04:59.547 --> 01:05:00.331
Oh.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:05.249
Oh man, that is hideous.

01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:11.255
At what fucking point?
Like 10 minutes after.

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:14.301
What inspired you?

01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:18.392
Somebody
commented on my channel

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.960
that if I kept the video up,

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:23.267
they would share it with
this massive network

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.616
connected to their channel.

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:27.880
I wanted to move out
of 11th place.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:28.663
Please.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.582
Thank you.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.933
The truth, thank you.

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:41.328
My next question is this.

01:05:41.372 --> 01:05:44.592
Would you rather stay in
11th place with no harm done

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:47.726
to anybody or move to first

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:50.859
even if it costs
somebody everything?

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:53.819
Number one, the fir--

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.560
- Bingo.
- No, no harm done.

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:57.997
Oh, no, please, no,
please, no!

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.346
Ah, please stop!

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.265
This is disgusting.

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:10.009
Just tell the truth.

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:13.621
The next part is
multiple choice.

01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:17.016
Did Bryan, A, hire
me to kill you?

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.672
B, kill himself?

01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:25.677
Or, C, both?

01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:29.246
It was a mistake, I don't...

01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:31.422
Wow.

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:33.076
It was false advertising.

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:35.034
For a gum commercial, really?

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.428
Your brother and father,
Nathaniel and Richard.

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:38.690
Can I call them
Nathaniel and Richard?

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:40.039
They're lawyers.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.998
What do you think their
stance on this would be?

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.261
Or should we ask them?

01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.218
Please, no.

01:06:45.262 --> 01:06:47.090
Tick, tock.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:49.614
Tick, tock.
C, it's C, both.

01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:51.050
Ah.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:54.053
Brava, ragazza,
grazie mille, si.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:59.102
Okay, perfect timing.

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:06.718
God, your followers
are gonna love this.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:25.128
You got what you
wanted, can you let me go?

01:07:28.218 --> 01:07:29.741
Oh, no.

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.105
You know the whole
tickling thing

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.759
is likely a result from trauma.

01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:49.978
It's, it's, I've researched it.

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:53.112
It's like a need for power
by making others feel small

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:53.982
and under control.

01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:56.115
I'm not responsible for that

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.117
or any of the twisted shit
that people put online.

01:07:58.161 --> 01:08:01.990
Who are you to decide
that it is twisted shit?

01:08:02.034 --> 01:08:03.818
I just mean that,

01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:06.082
ah, it's their choice to
do what they want to do.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:08.997
I'm only highlighting what
they're already doing.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.174
And anyway, they're lying.

01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:14.220
They lie in their ads to get
away with perverted shit!

01:08:14.264 --> 01:08:15.308
You lie.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.009
You social media stars,

01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:22.924
you think the world is all

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:25.492
about your shitty
fucking content.

01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:29.105
No, this is people's lives.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:33.152
And Jess, this is your life.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.894
I lie to help people.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.246
Just like my father.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.770
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:43.467
Shut up!

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:47.210
I am the director,
and you are my puppet.

01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:50.343
You speak when I
say you can speak.

01:08:51.823 --> 01:08:54.086
I'm gonna go finish
writing your speech.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.219
Get ready to be famous.

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:02.268
Tom, let me out!

01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:08.622
Help me!

01:09:14.498 --> 01:09:15.803
Let me out!

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.985
You wanna rehearse?

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:42.830
I'm Jess Peters, or as
you guys know me, J-PEEPS.

01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:44.180
- Perfect, okay.
- This is the last time--

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:45.659
Sorry, I don't
wanna interrupt, I just--

01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:47.052
Yo, Kai.

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:49.054
The other people's
hair out of your hair.

01:09:49.097 --> 01:09:49.924
Please don't.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.230
Oh God, what's this?

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.145
Oh, oh my fucking God.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.060
That came out so easy.
What the fuck?

01:09:55.103 --> 01:09:58.237
And I do want to get
your eyelashes if we can.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.631
So just behave for me.
What is she doing?

01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:02.023
Right now.

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:04.243
She's really
committing to this one.

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:06.027
I should have went with her.

01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:07.115
Dude.

01:10:08.116 --> 01:10:10.554
- Take, it off!
- Okay.

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:14.079
We're just gonna get it off
nice and slow now, okay?

01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:15.820
Okay, gotta get
the other one now.

01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.038
God, there it is.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:20.041
Good God, it's really--
Who is J-PEEPS?

01:10:20.085 --> 01:10:21.565
You follow her.

01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:25.221
Good, that
one was, okay, good.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:28.093
Now.

01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:30.269
I think we're ready J-PEEPS.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.445
Continue reading.

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:37.929
I'd like to apologize to you,
my loyal followers.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:39.670
Keep going.

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:41.628
Because I have
betrayed your trust.

01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:42.760
Good.

01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:46.720
What I'm about to
say may shock you,

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:51.725
but the truth is that I have
faked every episode of my show.

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:53.249
- Perfect.
- It's a little weird.

01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:57.557
Over the past few years,
I manufactured situations.

01:10:57.601 --> 01:10:59.385
Dad watches this.

01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:03.998
Doctored footage,
added audio,

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:07.872
and did my best to deceive
you about who I really am.

01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:09.221
You bitch.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.702
In order to make myself
seem heroic and likable.

01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:13.051
Mm-hmm.

01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:15.880
- She's faking this.
- Nobody has ever hurt me.

01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.926
Nobody has taken
advantage of me.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.145
Nope.

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:23.583
I have fabricated
all of these abuses,

01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:26.717
and my entire show is bullshit.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.590
From now on, do not like,
follow or subscribe.

01:11:30.634 --> 01:11:32.200
Goodbye.

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:33.985
And end recording.

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.203
Who is this guy?

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.553
What the hell?

01:11:36.596 --> 01:11:40.296
Wow, you really
are a bad actress.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.079
Impressive.

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:42.428
Okay.

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.212
What are you
gonna do with that video?

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:45.039
Now.

01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:49.174
I don't know if she knows
she's being live streamed.

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.571
Do you wanna fuck me?

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:57.008
- She's a fetishist now?
- Oh, good of you to offer?

01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:59.053
Does Mom know you watch this?

01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:02.056
No, okay.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.406
Here we go.

01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:04.537
Bam.

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:05.364
Delete.

01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:09.020
Yes, delete that.

01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:09.977
Bam.

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.457
Bam.
On, come on, please.

01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:12.545
Bam.

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:15.679
Just keep my channel, come on.

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:16.810
Hold on.

01:12:16.854 --> 01:12:18.856
And this one should be, yep.

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:20.031
Why do you have
to delete them all?

01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:21.424
You have a
lot to bargain with.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:24.122
Be my prisoner, delete.
Why are you doing this?

01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:27.125
Latex leggings, that
sounds great, delete.

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:29.040
Deleting this one.

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:32.391
Now this one, this one stays.

01:12:33.914 --> 01:12:36.526
I can't wait to be a lead
on "Classified Crazies."

01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:38.528
It's gonna be amazing.

01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:40.007
This one delete.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:43.620
This one I thought
we could do together.

01:12:43.663 --> 01:12:46.144
Just for old time sake.

01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:54.457
Just gotta give me that
finger onto the button!

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.894
Okay, because we're
gonna to do it together.

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.156
It's gonna be nice.

01:12:58.199 --> 01:12:59.244
Come on.

01:12:59.287 --> 01:13:01.159
Get it over there.

01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:01.942
Get it over.

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.815
- Ah, you bitch!
- Oh.

01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:08.514
Oh!

01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:10.995
Oh my God!

01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:11.996
What are you gonna do?

01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:14.520
What are you gonna do?
Come on, Jess, stop.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:16.043
Don't do that.
What are you gonna do?

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:19.133
What, are you gonna kill me
in front of 20,000 people?

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:23.355
Huh?

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.922
You see?

01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:26.445
We're live.

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:30.101
There are cameras
everywhere.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:32.233
This
guy is a lunatic.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.453
Live.

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.805
Kill me, I dare you.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.939
Oh my God.

01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:43.593
She won't do it.

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:46.030
Then you'll really
be the killer.

01:13:48.206 --> 01:13:49.468
Oh, look.

01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:53.820
It's what you've always wanted.

01:13:53.864 --> 01:13:55.213
See?

01:13:55.256 --> 01:13:58.695
I'm not the only one who
likes watching you suffer.

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:01.959
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:05.571
Oh my God.

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:06.572
Jess, stop!

01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:08.226
And cut!

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:09.880
No, no, no, get
it back, come on.

01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:11.229
Guys, get that back up.

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:12.099
What?

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.581
That is a wrap on the barn.

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:17.278
Beautiful work, people.

01:14:17.322 --> 01:14:18.454
All right guys,
let's get out of here.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:19.672
We gotta get going.

01:14:19.716 --> 01:14:21.718
Yo, that bed was
so tight under there,

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:22.588
when you guys were
bouncing up and down.

01:14:22.632 --> 01:14:23.981
I almost got a concussion.

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:25.417
What about when
she reached for the rope?

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.810
She got so close, she
almost touched my hand.

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:28.333
Dead ass.

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:30.683
And what about you, what
were you doing in the park?

01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.555
Hey man, I was
running to Vegas.

01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.208
Oh, my God.

01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:35.688
Okay, great stuff.

01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:37.821
Jess, let's go.

01:14:37.864 --> 01:14:39.823
Great work, really
special stuff.

01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:42.652
Now, money, money, money, money.

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:45.045
You're all about the money.

01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:48.919
Awesome.

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:49.833
Great work.

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:50.850
Run.

01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:20.227
But he
didn't physically hurt you?

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.054
No.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.536
Yeah, when he
ripped out my hair.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.234
The hair that wasn't yours.

01:16:27.278 --> 01:16:28.627
Oh my God.

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:31.717
Did he physically
hurt you anywhere else?

01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:32.936
No, not exactly.

01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:36.635
That's a
straightforward question.

01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:39.333
He hurt me mentally.

01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:40.683
And why did you
go to his house

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:43.424
all alone in the woods
if you didn't know him?

01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:44.643
It was for a job.

01:16:44.687 --> 01:16:47.864
Which, he paid
you for in advance.

01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:49.169
Yeah, like 100 bucks.

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:51.171
So this is your
profession, writing movies?

01:16:51.215 --> 01:16:52.259
No.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:54.827
But the screenplay
was about you?

01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:56.133
Yeah, sort of.

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:58.048
I mean, we were improvising.

01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:01.138
So when he tied you
up, was that improvising?

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.356
No.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.097
So when did it stop
being improvising?

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:05.533
As soon as he wouldn't
let me out of his house.

01:17:05.577 --> 01:17:07.710
He let you out earlier,
and you didn't want to go.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:08.580
Okay.

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:13.846
Look, I thought he
was gonna kill me.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:17.154
He tied me up in his
house and forced me

01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:21.201
to give him my passwords
and delete personal videos

01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:22.638
that I worked on for five years.

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.770
Like he clearly set
the whole thing up.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:25.815
Videos?

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.687
Live Hive videos.

01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:40.656
So, you're upset because he
didn't ask your permission.

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:45.791
Did you ask permission
of anyone in your videos?

01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:00.806
What if it's
still going on?

01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:02.895
Oh my god.

01:18:05.202 --> 01:18:06.943
What if it's not the
end of the movie?

01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:08.031
What movie?

01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:09.597
The movie that we're writing.

01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:11.861
The Hitchcock twist ending.

01:18:11.904 --> 01:18:13.427
Do you listen to
anything that I say?

01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:15.473
Yes, Hitchcock, I got you.

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:20.521
How did he know my passwords
unless he was watching me?

01:18:21.044 --> 01:18:22.654
Inside my apartment.

01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:26.049
You're gonna say it with me.

01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:27.920
No, I can't get there.

01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:29.139
Okay, so...

01:18:32.185 --> 01:18:36.886
He gives me the script and
then he lets me out unscathed.

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:39.802
Cut to one month later.

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:42.761
This is the climax of the movie.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.372
We're in the climax
of the movie.

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:14.097
Thank you.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.764
Okay.

01:19:33.246 --> 01:19:34.944
Door open.

01:20:06.279 --> 01:20:07.324
Squeakers?

01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.284
Squeakers!

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:13.025
Oh, hey, little guy.

01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:15.158
Oh my God.

01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:18.770
What are you doing,
you scared me.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:19.597
Ah.

01:20:58.462 --> 01:20:59.245
Hello?

01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:01.987
Yeah, who is it?

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:05.948
Hello.

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:41.668
B-A-R-B-I-E.

01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:50.547
We are the Collective.

01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:22.579
And there's Tom.

01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:29.194
In production.

01:24:38.899 --> 01:24:40.379
Fuck!

01:24:40.423 --> 01:24:41.467
Oh, come on!

01:24:45.384 --> 01:24:46.298
What?

01:24:51.738 --> 01:24:52.913
Take it off.

01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:53.958
Are you lying?

01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:54.785
No.

01:24:57.004 --> 01:24:59.659
I am the director and
you are my puppet.

01:24:59.703 --> 01:25:01.183
You speak when I...

01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:13.195
Oh.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.328
Oh, fuck.

01:25:53.235 --> 01:25:54.236
Oh my God.

01:26:07.553 --> 01:26:08.598
Oh God.

01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:11.557
What do you want from me?

01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:14.647
Stop watching me,
you sick fucks!

01:26:27.834 --> 01:26:29.662
Oh geez, don't hurt Squeakers.

01:26:29.706 --> 01:26:32.143
Please don't hurt Squeakers.

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:42.675
You're
so fucked up.

01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:45.504
You're all so fucked up.

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:54.905
Continue your movie.

01:26:54.948 --> 01:26:57.908
Stay the star if
you can stay alive?

01:27:00.476 --> 01:27:04.393
End your movie, become the
director, cast the next star.

01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:08.223
