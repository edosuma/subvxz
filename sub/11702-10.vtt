WEBVTT

00:01.022 --> 00:03.702
It's a miracle pill.
It stops the blood.

00:03.782 --> 00:04.802
Makes it thicker.

00:04.890 --> 00:06.930
I believe these are yours.

00:08.183 --> 00:11.183
These were meant to be posted.
To an ex-Governor?

00:11.303 --> 00:14.543
I expect Mr Channing felt
that was inappropriate.

00:14.663 --> 00:18.343
The Governor's cut off my meds.
I was hoping you could help me out.

00:18.463 --> 00:20.983
And you want this shit on a regular
basis? Then you're my hench.

00:21.103 --> 00:24.823
I need you to be my eyes
and ears on Franky's crew.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.343
There is a bad stash of
gear coming into the prison.

00:27.423 --> 00:29.063
It's called Pink Dragon.

00:31.263 --> 00:33.863
You have an informer in your ranks.

00:33.983 --> 00:36.103
Franky, it was me!
What?

00:36.223 --> 00:38.703
It was me.
You have got to be strong.

00:38.823 --> 00:43.383
It's easy for you to say.
You don't even have kids, Liz.

00:43.463 --> 00:45.503
I've... I've got two kids, Dor.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.663
And I stuffed up with both of them.

01:38.294 --> 01:41.494
It's taken me seven years,

01:41.614 --> 01:46.774
four months,
22 days to write this letter.

01:46.854 --> 01:49.774
Well, at least finish it.

01:49.894 --> 01:53.334
When I was first sentenced,
I was terrified of what was

01:53.414 --> 01:58.254
waiting for me inside here.

01:58.374 --> 02:03.934
But what's made Wentworth so
hard wasn't on the inside at all.

02:04.054 --> 02:07.814
It was knowing what I was
missing on the outside.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.814
Being a mother,

02:09.934 --> 02:15.614
watching you grow up,
fall in love for the first time.

02:21.014 --> 02:25.574
Being able to protect
you from danger.

02:25.654 --> 02:27.774
To keep you safe.

02:31.894 --> 02:37.054
But also all the little things,
the normal things

02:37.134 --> 02:39.574
that families do together.

02:41.774 --> 02:46.374
And now, the day I've waited
so long for has finally arrived.

02:47.654 --> 02:52.374
And I'm more scared going
out than I was coming in.

03:12.574 --> 03:15.694
Visitor.
Two minutes, that's all.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.334
Bea.
Look at you.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.814
God, look at you.

03:27.254 --> 03:30.494
It's my fault.

03:30.574 --> 03:32.094
You did what you had to do.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.694
Why did you ask to be moved to H2?

03:38.294 --> 03:40.134
Keep an eye on Doreen.

03:40.214 --> 03:42.174
How's she goin'?

03:42.294 --> 03:48.734
She's alright. Why didn't
you tell me about your kids?

03:48.814 --> 03:50.574
It was easier, Bea.

03:52.214 --> 03:57.054
If I didn't talk about 'em, if
I didn't think about 'em, and if

03:57.134 --> 03:59.174
I didn't have 'em in here with me,

04:01.014 --> 04:02.934
then they didn't exist.

04:07.734 --> 04:10.694
But they do exist.

04:10.774 --> 04:13.374
Oh, you never stop being a mum.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.654
Doesn't matter where you are,

04:15.734 --> 04:17.654
or how long it's been.

04:19.254 --> 04:20.814
You're right.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.374
You're right.

04:23.454 --> 04:25.454
Come here.

04:25.534 --> 04:28.054
Smith. Time.

04:51.934 --> 04:54.014
Fuckin' bitch!

04:55.454 --> 04:58.294
Everything's finally
falling into place.

04:58.414 --> 05:00.374
Change is always
difficult in the beginning.

05:00.494 --> 05:02.574
That's when you meet
the most resistance.

05:02.694 --> 05:05.454
They test your mettle,
hope you'll give up.

05:05.574 --> 05:09.414
But if you stick with it, they
lose their resolve. Like Doyle.

05:09.534 --> 05:12.414
I think we can quietly
congratulate ourselves.

05:12.494 --> 05:14.214
OK, Graeme. Yeah, we'll talk later.

05:16.454 --> 05:19.294
Hello, Joan. Great to see you.

05:21.214 --> 05:23.574
The promotion doesn't come
into effect until next month,

05:23.694 --> 05:26.134
but unofficially I have
started board duties.

05:26.214 --> 05:28.574
I thought you were overseas on, uh,

05:28.694 --> 05:30.574
sabbatical?
A fact-finding mission, actually.

05:30.694 --> 05:32.974
Examining the prison
systems of Scandinavia.

05:33.054 --> 05:34.934
The board want me to explore

05:35.054 --> 05:38.214
where we might be able to
implement some of my findings.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.574
Which brings you here today.

05:40.694 --> 05:43.934
Mm. I'd like to begin by reviewing
some of the systems in place here.

05:44.054 --> 05:46.934
May I ask why we have
been given the honour?

05:47.054 --> 05:50.134
There's been some concern over
recent incidents.

05:50.254 --> 05:53.014
Such as?
The garden project, for one.

05:53.134 --> 05:56.254
I'm not making any judgements.
I'm just here to find the facts.

05:56.334 --> 05:58.854
I see. Well let's hope we get to

05:58.974 --> 06:01.534
the bottom of it quickly, hmm?
Good.

06:01.654 --> 06:05.134
Oh, I, uh, would like to set up
an executive office, if I may.

06:05.214 --> 06:06.654
Of course.

06:06.774 --> 06:09.134
And please let me know if
there's anything else you require.

06:09.159 --> 06:10.734
You know, there is actually.

06:10.854 --> 06:13.094
I think for the moment
it would be best if

06:13.214 --> 06:14.814
Matt Fletcher's
transfer was put on hold.

06:14.839 --> 06:17.774
I'm not sure that's
in our hands anymore.

06:17.854 --> 06:20.214
I've already taken care of it.

06:20.294 --> 06:21.774
I'll keep you updated.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.774
The transfer's off.

06:48.214 --> 06:49.854
What'd Ferguson say?

06:49.974 --> 06:53.414
Doesn't matter what she says. It's
what I do from here that counts.

06:53.494 --> 06:55.014
And what's that gonna be?

06:55.134 --> 06:57.574
I need concrete evidence of
everything you've been telling me,

06:57.599 --> 06:59.174
implicating Ferguson.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.734
And I need official complaints.
Oh, should be no shortage of those.

07:02.854 --> 07:04.654
Not just from prisoners
and not just from you.

07:04.694 --> 07:06.934
I need at least one other officer.

07:07.054 --> 07:09.174
Might be a big call, mate.
She's pretty intimidating.

07:10.894 --> 07:14.574
Man, if you help me
get rid of Ferguson,

07:14.694 --> 07:17.494
I will recommend to the board
you're her permanent replacement.

07:17.614 --> 07:22.534
No offence, Derek, but they didn't
warm to me last time, did they?

07:22.614 --> 07:24.854
I wasn't on the board then, was I?

07:40.934 --> 07:42.494
I've spoken to the owner of

07:42.614 --> 07:46.134
the restaurant and he's agreed to
give you an interview on Monday.

07:46.254 --> 07:48.134
Really?
Mm.

07:48.254 --> 07:50.214
It's just an
interview at this stage.

07:50.294 --> 07:52.054
Oh, no, that's great.

07:52.134 --> 07:54.934
I've never been a waitress before.

07:55.054 --> 07:58.534
Well, it, it won't be front of
house. It'll be in the kitchen.

07:58.614 --> 08:01.814
Oh, like washing dishes?

08:01.934 --> 08:05.054
Oh, that's alright. No worries.
And just an interview at this

08:05.174 --> 08:07.694
stage.
Yep.

08:07.814 --> 08:10.494
Now, this will be waiting
for you in the discharge area.

08:10.614 --> 08:13.494
It has your banking details, your
debit card and the paperwork for

08:13.574 --> 08:16.334
the halfway house. Yep.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.894
Now, I can't stress to you enough
the importance of abiding by those

08:19.974 --> 08:21.854
rules. They're there to help you.

08:21.974 --> 08:25.094
There are so many girls who end
up back in here because of silly

08:25.174 --> 08:27.174
things, like breaking curfew or

08:27.294 --> 08:29.294
having a boyfriend
back in their room.

08:29.374 --> 08:31.174
Oh, God, there's no risk there.

08:31.254 --> 08:33.174
Well, hopefully we'll have you out

08:33.294 --> 08:35.654
of there as quickly as possible.
Yep.

08:35.774 --> 08:38.134
And it's so wonderful that
you've made meaningful contact

08:38.214 --> 08:40.054
with your daughter.

08:40.174 --> 08:43.054
Is she meeting you today?
Yeah, they're, they're all comin'.

08:43.134 --> 08:44.854
Oh, that's great.

08:44.974 --> 08:47.254
You'll have so much to catch up on.
Yeah.

08:51.814 --> 08:56.734
Vera! Come in. Take a seat.

08:56.814 --> 08:58.774
How are you?

08:58.894 --> 09:00.534
Good, thank you. Busy.
Yep.

09:02.694 --> 09:04.974
Well, it must have
been hard for you.

09:05.094 --> 09:07.454
Sorry?
Your mother.

09:07.574 --> 09:10.214
Now, that in itself would have
been hard enough, but everything

09:10.294 --> 09:12.574
that's been going on here.

09:12.654 --> 09:14.094
I... I don't follow.

09:14.174 --> 09:17.614
Vera. You're safe in this room.

09:17.734 --> 09:21.814
What we talk about is
strictly between you and me.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.134
OK?

09:24.214 --> 09:27.094
Now...

09:27.214 --> 09:30.574
You have heard I've been promoted to
the board and we're all very eager

09:30.694 --> 09:34.494
to get to the bottom of what's been
going on, specifically this, um...

09:34.574 --> 09:37.094
This whole garden fiasco.

09:37.174 --> 09:38.694
Well, my understanding of

09:38.814 --> 09:42.134
the garden project is that Governor
Ferguson shut down a drug supply.

09:42.254 --> 09:45.854
I don't think the board sees
things as optimistically as you do.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.734
Now, listen, you should know this.

09:55.414 --> 09:57.254
They're lookin' for her replacement.

09:59.374 --> 10:01.774
And I think it should be you.

10:01.854 --> 10:03.974
If you cooperate.

10:04.054 --> 10:05.694
Cooperate?

10:05.774 --> 10:07.654
Mm. I'd like you to make

10:07.774 --> 10:10.734
an official statement about what
really happened in the garden.

10:10.854 --> 10:16.094
As far as I'm aware, I've just
told you what really happened.

10:16.174 --> 10:18.614
Vera, come on.

10:18.734 --> 10:22.534
You don't want your record tarred
with the same brush as hers, do you?

10:22.654 --> 10:25.974
Change is always
difficult at the beginning.

10:27.614 --> 10:30.574
I've been here a very long time
and I've never seen this prison

10:30.654 --> 10:33.814
run more professionally.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.694
I have to say I'm disappointed.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.134
Because I really thought
that I could count on you.

11:03.494 --> 11:06.334
And that's it.
I'll speak to you next week,

11:06.454 --> 11:09.254
but you've got my number, you can
ring me about anything at any time.

11:09.374 --> 11:11.454
Alright. Well, thanks for
everything, Rachel. See ya.

11:11.574 --> 11:14.374
Right. Good luck, Liz.
See ya. Thank you.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.214
Ms Sanger.

11:18.294 --> 11:20.214
Mr Channing.

12:53.934 --> 12:57.134
Can I help you?
I'm looking for my deputy.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.774
I was told she was with you?
You've just missed her.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.414
Clearly. Thank you.

13:15.134 --> 13:17.054
What'd they say?
Seven years.

13:17.174 --> 13:18.814
Oh, fuck!
Fucking judge

13:18.894 --> 13:21.374
gave me seven more fuckin' years.

13:21.494 --> 13:27.294
So I'll be, what, fuckin'
forty-fuckin'-three before I get

13:27.374 --> 13:29.214
outta here!

13:29.294 --> 13:31.334
Booms! Miss Miles, I got it.

13:31.414 --> 13:33.774
Come on.

13:35.534 --> 13:38.014
Oh, Booms. OK.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.214
That fuckin' nagging bitch.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.734
Yeah, I know.

13:44.814 --> 13:46.574
I'm gonna fuckin' get her.

13:50.054 --> 13:53.094
I'm gonna fuckin' well
make Liz pay.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.654
Yeah.
Yeah?

14:02.059 --> 14:04.867
Hey, promise me
you'll keep your head down, yeah?

14:04.947 --> 14:08.998
You stay out of Ferguson's way, OK?

14:09.119 --> 14:12.207
And I'm sorry about
what happened to Maggie.

14:12.287 --> 14:14.453
It was a sweet little bird.

14:14.533 --> 14:15.806
Come on, ladies.

14:33.024 --> 14:35.310
Here, give us a hug. It's alright.

14:35.430 --> 14:40.203
It's alright, darlin'.
It's alright. It's alright, love.

14:40.283 --> 14:46.701
You're gonna be alright. Alright?

14:47.062 --> 14:49.629
You're gonna be right.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.875
OK? And I'll come and visit ya.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.720
OK.
OK?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.367
Stop crying, alright?

14:56.488 --> 15:01.100
Love you.
Bye, Liz!

15:01.220 --> 15:04.469
Oh, Jesus, you're makin' me
cry, ya silly buggers.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.956
It's beautiful, isn't it, eh?

15:07.157 --> 15:11.127
Thanks, girls. You don't do
anything I wouldn't do, alright?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.053
See ya, girls.

15:30.941 --> 15:32.546
Liz!

15:32.666 --> 15:34.832
Oh, Jess. See ya, darlin'.

15:34.952 --> 15:37.279
I'll miss you.
You'll be right. You'll be right.

15:37.359 --> 15:39.886
Bye, girls.

15:42.052 --> 15:44.057
Don't make me cry, alright?

15:50.635 --> 15:55.207
Hey, for what it's worth...

15:55.328 --> 16:00.101
It wasn't Jacs
that killed Meg. It was Franky.

16:00.221 --> 16:04.031
What?
Love ya.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.236
Thank you, Will.

16:20.316 --> 16:22.241
Look after the girls.

16:22.361 --> 16:24.126
Take care, Liz.
Yep.

17:25.364 --> 17:28.733
Psst! Hey!

17:28.814 --> 17:30.378
What's up your arse?

17:30.459 --> 17:33.587
Razor fucking wire to keep you out.

17:33.707 --> 17:36.354
Just watch your
language in the library, will ya?

17:39.683 --> 17:42.089
Warner.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.376
What are you doin' there?

17:44.410 --> 17:46.696
Nothing, Mr Fletcher.

17:51.148 --> 17:54.397
Hey, it's clean.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.250
You gotta face your demons, Jess.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.857
And you can't let
the system beat you down.

18:01.937 --> 18:03.421
OK?

18:05.106 --> 18:08.836
Come on. It's time to
re-join the real world.

18:34.265 --> 18:36.271
OK, shoppers, come on down here.

18:36.391 --> 18:38.958
We've got specials all day long.
There's so many types of bags...

18:38.983 --> 18:44.960
You can't stand out there,
come on in.

18:48.223 --> 18:50.991
Cheers, mate.

19:06.313 --> 19:10.163
No drugs. No alcohol. No excuses.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.532
Any alcohol in your room
is a breach of parole.

19:13.653 --> 19:18.345
There's no cooking in your room.
No loud music, and no visitors.

19:18.466 --> 19:24.402
Curfew is at 10pm,
not 10.15, not 10.05, 10.

19:24.522 --> 19:27.370
If you are late you'll
find the front door locked.

19:27.490 --> 19:30.539
Failure to meet curfew
is a breach of parole.

19:35.111 --> 19:38.520
Keep your door locked at all
times, especially when you're in.

19:38.601 --> 19:40.085
Any questions?

19:40.165 --> 19:41.970
No. Thanks.

20:07.078 --> 20:08.602
I wonder what she's
doing right now.

20:08.682 --> 20:10.447
Mmm. Can you

20:10.527 --> 20:13.014
imagine your first day out?

20:13.094 --> 20:15.581
Oh, I'd have a huge steak.

20:15.702 --> 20:17.547
Mmm.
And some radishes.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.194
What?
Oh, I know it's weird, but I've

20:20.314 --> 20:22.881
been craving 'em all week, true.
You know the first thing I'd do?

20:22.906 --> 20:26.531
I'd run a long hot bath
and I'd just soak for days.

20:26.651 --> 20:28.537
And wash the stink of
this place out of my hair.

20:28.562 --> 20:33.269
It'd be nice to see something that didn't
have barbed wire attached to it, eh? Yeah.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.796
And just open a window
and breathe in some fresh air.

20:35.877 --> 20:37.842
Oh, that'd be so good.

20:37.922 --> 20:40.850
Oh, give me a break!

20:52.041 --> 20:53.605
Hey.

20:53.966 --> 20:56.011
He's gonna do it.
Who?

20:56.132 --> 20:58.819
Me Uncle Norm. He's gonna bash
the shit out of Liz. Right, he

20:58.939 --> 21:02.228
owes me a favour. I just gotta...
I just gotta find out where she is.

21:02.349 --> 21:04.153
Can you guys go?
Sure.

21:06.079 --> 21:09.287
Booms...
Don't. Don't...

21:09.368 --> 21:10.852
don't you try and stop me, OK?

21:10.972 --> 21:13.499
I'm not. I'm just telling you to
be careful on the phones, yeah?

21:13.579 --> 21:15.745
Don't be overt.
Hey?

21:15.825 --> 21:17.791
Talk in code, yeah?

21:17.871 --> 21:19.395
I'm not stupid!

21:19.515 --> 21:21.360
I'm not...
Doyle!

21:31.067 --> 21:32.791
My main concern

21:32.912 --> 21:37.043
is that you were exposed to an
unacceptable level of danger.

21:37.123 --> 21:38.808
As opposed to an acceptable level?

21:40.412 --> 21:42.378
In a way, yes.

21:44.022 --> 21:46.268
You were nearly raped
under Ferguson's watch.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.715
Oh, so you raced down here
to see if I was alright?

21:48.835 --> 21:51.121
I just wanted to make sure
it never happens again.

21:51.242 --> 21:53.688
With your help.
With my help?

21:53.809 --> 21:56.656
Mm-hmm.
You confiscated and read my

21:56.737 --> 21:58.301
private mail. Now you want my help?

21:58.381 --> 22:00.427
That was a different matter.

22:00.547 --> 22:02.392
In this place,
everything's connected.

22:02.512 --> 22:04.438
Wouldn't you like to see
a change of management?

22:08.007 --> 22:12.700
Tell me, did they turn you on?
What?

22:12.780 --> 22:14.545
My letters to Erica.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.711
Did they turn you on?

22:16.831 --> 22:25.134
Did you imagine us together? What
I'd do to her? What she'd do to me?

22:28.303 --> 22:31.592
Was I even in the picture or was it
just the two of you?

22:37.849 --> 22:39.613
Maybe it was all three.

22:43.384 --> 22:48.598
Fuck you.
If you write out an official

22:48.718 --> 22:51.766
complaint about what happened
in the garden, I might be able

22:51.847 --> 22:53.491
to help you with the assault charge.

22:53.611 --> 22:55.899
Might be able to help?
You'll have to do better than that.

22:55.978 --> 22:58.104
OK.

22:58.224 --> 23:00.310
I'll provide you with a
glowing character reference.

23:00.430 --> 23:03.559
I mean, they don't come much
better than that, do they, huh?

23:03.679 --> 23:06.928
From the Regional General Manager
of Corrections.

23:09.775 --> 23:12.182
So what'd Ferguson do to you?

23:12.262 --> 23:15.391
I just wanna run a safe prison.

23:15.511 --> 23:18.439
Oh, OK. Well, you're not getting'
jack shit from me until I see that

23:18.519 --> 23:21.888
character reference.

23:22.009 --> 23:25.137
I can give you a hell of a lot more
on Ferguson than what happened in

23:25.218 --> 23:28.266
the garden. Get writing.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.221
Boomer's going after Liz.
She's gonna have her bashed.

23:41.301 --> 23:43.668
How?

23:43.748 --> 23:45.312
Boomer's uncle.

23:45.392 --> 23:48.521
Shit! Do you know when?

23:48.641 --> 23:52.171
She doesn't know
where Liz's staying.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.537
But once she gets the address
she's not gonna mess about.

23:54.618 --> 23:56.463
You let me know if
you hear anything.

24:10.060 --> 24:14.191
I'll take them.
Hi.

24:14.271 --> 24:16.597
I'm Liz.

24:16.678 --> 24:19.646
I know. I'm Kay.

24:19.726 --> 24:22.774
Hi, Kay.

24:22.854 --> 24:25.542
Ah, these are for Sophie and Artie.

24:25.662 --> 24:31.157
I, um, wanted them to have these
letters. They're just a, um...

24:34.165 --> 24:37.414
Seems a bit strange that
you never wrote in all that time,

24:37.494 --> 24:38.978
and now you do.

24:39.059 --> 24:42.588
Well I'm... I'm out now.

24:45.195 --> 24:49.206
Just... it could be a little
confusing for them, that's all.

24:50.971 --> 24:52.776
I guess it would be, yeah.

24:55.182 --> 24:58.070
It's not my place to tell
you what you can and can't do.

24:58.191 --> 25:04.327
But when you did what you did

25:04.448 --> 25:07.416
and then
disappeared from their lives,

25:07.496 --> 25:10.424
the children were broken.

25:10.544 --> 25:12.269
Took them a very long time to get
over it.

25:12.389 --> 25:16.681
I just don't want
to see them get hurt again.

25:16.761 --> 25:19.970
I understand.

25:20.251 --> 25:23.139
Here. I'll make sure they get them.

25:23.219 --> 25:25.505
No, it's OK. I'll...

25:36.776 --> 25:38.661
Fuck! Phone! Ring, ring!

25:38.741 --> 25:41.669
Ring, ring! Ring, ring!

25:43.273 --> 25:44.717
Someone answer the fuckin' phone!

25:44.798 --> 25:47.124
She's not answering.

25:47.204 --> 25:48.648
Try again.

25:50.453 --> 25:52.458
Alright ladies, phones are closed.

25:52.579 --> 25:54.023
Shit!
We have to just make this call.

25:54.143 --> 25:56.108
No.
Two minutes.

25:56.229 --> 25:57.993
No. Come on, let's go.
You know the rules.

25:59.919 --> 26:01.323
Yep.
Hey.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.015
Hey.
I, uh... I can't get Liz's

26:06.136 --> 26:09.585
address cos that bitch Sanger,
whatever, won't give it to me.

26:09.705 --> 26:13.476
Oh, Jesus, Booms!
You asked a fuckin' parole officer?

26:13.596 --> 26:15.682
That's not exactly keepin'
it on the down low, is it?

26:15.802 --> 26:17.366
Yeah, I didn't tell
her what it was for.

26:17.446 --> 26:19.612
Well, thank fuck
for small miracles.

26:19.733 --> 26:23.262
This is exactly what I was telling
you about. Don't leave a trail.

26:23.342 --> 26:25.067
Yeah, alright already!

26:25.147 --> 26:27.033
I'm, I'm, I'm pissed off.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.559
Yeah I know, but you don't
wanna get more time because of it.

26:29.584 --> 26:32.046
Maybe you should
just leave it for now.

26:32.207 --> 26:34.613
No way! I'm just sayin' that your
head's not fuckin' in it...

26:34.638 --> 26:40.454
No! I am the one who got seven years
and it wasn't even my gear.

26:48.090 --> 26:52.823
I'm... I am gonna get her.

26:53.063 --> 26:56.753
But, um, but I need ya help.

27:21.180 --> 27:22.784
Shut up!

27:22.865 --> 27:26.434
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

27:33.215 --> 27:35.180
Is this it?

27:35.260 --> 27:36.784
Yeah.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.349
Next time there better be more.

27:39.111 --> 27:40.073
Huh?!

27:44.084 --> 27:45.528
Oh, God.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.893
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.932
Wentworth's own clitterati!

28:21.013 --> 28:23.335
Minus the martinis.

28:25.697 --> 28:28.020
Booms.
Yo.

28:28.099 --> 28:29.541
What's this?

28:31.518 --> 28:33.840
Oh, you got it?

28:33.869 --> 28:34.990
Yeah, just be careful, yeah?

28:35.015 --> 28:36.943
Fuckin' excellent!
Just be careful, yeah?

28:37.062 --> 28:38.864
Yeah.
Boomer.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.587
Yeah.
I'm sorry you got seven years.

28:46.221 --> 28:50.385
Governor, you wanted to see me?
Ah, Ms Sanger. Come on through.

28:51.985 --> 28:53.426
Close the door.

28:57.190 --> 28:58.911
And please, take a seat.

29:02.554 --> 29:05.477
Now I, uh, don't want to discuss
your private relationship with

29:05.596 --> 29:08.319
Mr Channing. That's your business.

29:08.439 --> 29:11.602
But as Governor of this prison,
I would like to know just why

29:11.722 --> 29:13.363
you were sharing
parolees' files with him?

29:13.403 --> 29:16.366
I'm sorry?
Am I mistaken?

29:18.087 --> 29:20.809
No, but it's,
it's not like that at all...

29:20.889 --> 29:23.491
Like what?

29:23.611 --> 29:26.053
Well, Mr Channing works
with me to help parolees.

29:26.173 --> 29:31.378
He uses his contacts to help
organise job interviews and he...

29:31.458 --> 29:33.499
He gives references for housing.

29:33.620 --> 29:39.184
The Regional GM of Corrections
writes references for parolees?

29:39.304 --> 29:43.387
Well, no, not all parolees. Just
the ones that need it the most.

29:43.468 --> 29:45.109
Um, the ones without family or

29:45.228 --> 29:47.471
support who end up
in halfway houses.

29:47.591 --> 29:50.713
He has been a tremendous
support to some of the girls.

29:50.834 --> 29:54.356
Well, I was not aware of
the extent of his generous spirit.

29:54.437 --> 29:57.639
Thank you for clearing that up.

29:57.759 --> 30:01.722
Will that be all?
Thank you.

30:18.496 --> 30:20.458
Boomer's got Liz's address.

30:22.099 --> 30:24.981
Oh, shit!
Did you manage to warn her?

30:25.061 --> 30:27.543
No, I couldn't get a hold of her.

30:27.663 --> 30:31.666
We gotta stop Boomer from getting'
to the phones. Where is she now?

30:39.072 --> 30:45.038
What the fuck!
Hello? Hello!

30:45.717 --> 30:48.840
Hey, somebody!

30:51.442 --> 30:55.406
Thank you, no. No message.

31:02.332 --> 31:06.214
This is the last of the parolees
processed by Rachel Sanger.

31:07.816 --> 31:09.737
Can I ask what your concern is?

31:09.857 --> 31:12.019
Is there anything wrong with
Channing helping parolees?

31:12.044 --> 31:14.981
Just close the door.

31:15.102 --> 31:18.544
Tell me what you
see with these forms.

31:20.426 --> 31:22.267
Do you see any pattern?

31:22.347 --> 31:24.309
They're all re-offenders.

31:24.429 --> 31:28.112
70% of parolees are
re-offenders. Just look closer.

31:28.232 --> 31:33.196
They were all paroled at
the same halfway house. Standstead.

31:33.316 --> 31:37.600
Come over here, have a look at
these and tell me what you see.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.001
Look at, look at the photos.
You notice anything?

31:42.684 --> 31:44.886
They're all quite attractive.

31:45.085 --> 31:47.848
And young.
So...?

31:48.729 --> 31:52.772
These five were billeted to
Standstead House but with no family,

31:53.132 --> 31:55.174
no support. And they all left

31:55.294 --> 31:57.576
within one week without
giving a forwarding address.

31:57.776 --> 32:00.539
They're effectively missing.

32:13.429 --> 32:17.752
Hello? Yeah, I'm on my way now.
I'll be probably like 20 minutes.

32:18.353 --> 32:22.076
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it'll hold up a bit.

32:22.196 --> 32:24.758
Bye.
Don't you look gorgeous.

32:24.878 --> 32:26.559
Do ya reckon?
Looks beautiful, darling.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.201
I've gotta go. The train's in

32:28.321 --> 32:30.202
like 20 minutes.
Will you be late, do you think,

32:30.227 --> 32:33.069
or...?
No, no, no. I gotta go. Bye.

32:55.303 --> 32:59.626
Hello? Is anyone out there?

33:04.430 --> 33:07.673
I'm in the fridge!

33:11.115 --> 33:14.838
Who the fuck locked me in there?

33:14.918 --> 33:17.080
I don't know.

33:17.201 --> 33:19.242
Jesus!
It's not funny!

33:19.322 --> 33:21.244
Me nips are frozen solid. Look.

33:21.324 --> 33:23.125
What happened?

33:23.245 --> 33:25.807
I dunno, do I? Oh, what time is it?
I dunno.

33:25.927 --> 33:29.811
Are the phones still on? Oh, fuck.
Cheers, dickhead. I gotta go!

33:45.143 --> 33:48.305
Hey, Booms, can I please cut in?
Nuh.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.988
Oh, come on, mate, it's
a really important call.

33:51.068 --> 33:53.790
Piss off, alright. Hurry up.

33:56.232 --> 33:57.393
You know, Boomer?

33:57.753 --> 34:00.956
I haven't forgotten everything
that you've done to me.

34:01.036 --> 34:03.478
You'd better forget it, eh.

34:03.598 --> 34:06.120
Hey, watch it!
You watch it!

34:06.200 --> 34:08.121
You know,

34:08.242 --> 34:11.724
I'm gonna take you down.
You and your pimp bitch Franky.

34:11.804 --> 34:13.886
Yeah, you guys are over.

34:13.966 --> 34:17.329
Whatever!

34:17.409 --> 34:20.772
Hey, who are you calling, Boomer?

34:20.851 --> 34:24.054
Daz? Oh, no, that's right.

34:24.134 --> 34:25.936
He's nuts deep in ya sister, yeah?

34:27.578 --> 34:31.940
But I guess that makes sense, right?
She was always the skinny one.

34:32.061 --> 34:36.264
Bitch!
Come on.

34:39.107 --> 34:40.947
You alright or you need me to give
you a hand?

34:43.150 --> 34:45.871
Oi, Jenkins!
Let go of me!

34:46.032 --> 34:49.395
That's enough!
Let go!

34:50.155 --> 34:53.239
Right. I'd say you're in the slot.
She started it.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.440
I didn't do anything, mate.
She's just outta control.

34:55.465 --> 34:57.161
Oh, you're gone!

34:57.242 --> 34:59.283
When I get out, you are so dead!

34:59.363 --> 35:03.246
Dead! Ya hear me? Dead!

35:03.686 --> 35:05.328
Dead!

35:32.190 --> 35:35.833
Yeah, can we get, um...
Oh, actually, can we go four drinks?

35:35.953 --> 35:39.036
Four drinks.
These girls are thirsty.

35:39.116 --> 35:40.836
Bryce is, Bryce is getting'...

35:40.917 --> 35:42.558
Bryce is getting us drinks, hey?

35:42.638 --> 35:44.359
Vodka and raspberry.

35:47.362 --> 35:52.046
Here you go. Rib eye, well done.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

36:08.579 --> 36:11.862
Keep the change.

36:11.942 --> 36:13.383
Shots?

36:14.985 --> 36:17.106
Shots, shot, shot, shots! Go.

36:17.226 --> 36:19.068
Three, two, one...
Cheers!

36:25.032 --> 36:31.238
Mr Fletcher!
Jess.

36:33.279 --> 36:36.041
I just wanted to say thank you.

36:36.161 --> 36:38.323
You know, for looking out
for me when I was upset.

36:39.724 --> 36:42.847
And I wanted
to give your hanky back.

36:54.456 --> 36:57.338
Goodnight, Jess.
Goodnight, Mr Fletcher.

37:09.868 --> 37:12.311
Sophie, no!

37:15.874 --> 37:18.036
She's such a slut.

37:19.997 --> 37:22.358
So, Bryce is hot.

37:22.479 --> 37:24.801
Mm, sort of.
You gonna go with him?

37:24.881 --> 37:26.923
I don't know.

37:27.042 --> 37:29.364
Yeah, well
if you keep drinking like that,

37:29.445 --> 37:31.166
you're gonna spew all over him.

37:31.286 --> 37:33.648
Shut up.
I mean it, Soph. I mean, you know

37:33.768 --> 37:36.410
you can't handle shots.
No, it just makes it easier,

37:36.530 --> 37:38.572
you know.
Yeah, what?

37:38.652 --> 37:41.054
To talk to them.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.217
You! You're an idiot.

37:47.979 --> 37:50.862
Look what I got!

38:00.230 --> 38:02.872
Sophie!
We are goin' for a walk.

38:03.112 --> 38:05.994
No! Call me, OK?

38:06.154 --> 38:08.116
Mm-hmm.

38:32.415 --> 38:35.218
Please, stop. Don't! Get off!

38:39.621 --> 38:42.223
Hey, get off her!
Fuck!

38:42.303 --> 38:45.146
You little mongrel! Come on, darl.

38:45.225 --> 38:48.669
Come on. Come on. It's OK, love.

38:48.789 --> 38:50.350
Who are you?
It doesn't matter who I am.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.952
Fuckin' old moll!

38:53.072 --> 38:56.395
You're right, darling,
you're right. OK, we'll just...

38:56.475 --> 38:58.036
Come here, darl. Hey.

38:58.117 --> 39:00.759
14 Errington Street, Williamstown.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.040
Is 50 enough?

39:03.160 --> 39:05.642
No? Here's another
50 for your help, OK?

39:05.803 --> 39:08.845
Right. Thank you.
Let's get you in.

39:09.926 --> 39:12.327
That's the girl. Watch your head.

39:12.408 --> 39:15.731
There we are. Good girl. That's it.

39:15.851 --> 39:18.533
That's the way.

39:22.656 --> 39:25.498
Mum?

39:26.219 --> 39:27.980
Soph.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.302
Mum?

39:55.762 --> 39:59.565
I'm telling you, I don't know what you're
talking about. I don't know anything.

40:16.757 --> 40:21.961
Where you been, huh?
You missed curfew,

40:22.041 --> 40:25.924
and that's gonna cost ya.

40:28.687 --> 40:34.771
If you ever come near me again,
or anyone, I'm gonna cut off your balls.

40:35.571 --> 40:46.405
D'ya understand? Hey? And have a
shower, for God's sake!

41:09.199 --> 41:12.162
I found out where
those missing girls went.

41:12.254 --> 41:15.497
And I'm not sure the parole
board would be happy about it.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.155
Perhaps we should
swap offices, seeing

41:37.275 --> 41:40.718
how you like this one so much.
Apologies for the intrusion.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.760
I won't take much of your time.

41:45.722 --> 41:48.965
How's your investigation going?
Any success?

41:49.085 --> 41:51.287
Well, to be honest, I'm shocked
by what I've discovered.

41:51.311 --> 41:52.768
Really?
Mm. Yeah.

41:52.887 --> 41:59.974
Attempted rape, violent assault,
drug conduit and a pregnancy.

42:00.054 --> 42:03.336
All under your watch.

42:03.456 --> 42:06.979
I have witness statements here
that outline a litany of failure.

42:11.102 --> 42:17.828
I'm sorry, Joan,
but it just doesn't look good. In there?

42:17.908 --> 42:20.790
Mm?

42:20.911 --> 42:25.714
I'm sorry, I thought that was
the file you kept on parolees.

42:27.116 --> 42:30.438
What? The young women
at Standstead Halfway House?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.681
And your point is?

42:36.964 --> 42:40.486
My point is that you
have been recruiting

42:40.566 --> 42:43.168
ex-prisoners to work in a brothel.

42:43.289 --> 42:47.372
Only a sick mind
would come up with that bullshit.

42:47.492 --> 42:49.894
I agree. Accessing vulnerable
women when they're released

42:50.014 --> 42:51.935
from prison, coercing them into
prostitution, that's pretty sick...

42:52.016 --> 42:53.857
You don't have a skerrick of proof

42:53.977 --> 42:56.820
and if you repeat that accusation,
I swear I will make you pay for it...

42:56.940 --> 42:59.301
You are the co-owner of a
brothel, is that not correct?

42:59.422 --> 43:01.984
Under the company name,
'JR Entertainment'?

43:02.104 --> 43:05.186
It's where we found several
of the parolees working.

43:06.868 --> 43:10.391
You are a registered director
of that company.

43:16.556 --> 43:19.158
What the fuck do you want?

43:21.639 --> 43:23.922
Hmm?

43:27.524 --> 43:29.566
What, you want...

43:30.207 --> 43:33.289
You want me to resign?

43:34.650 --> 43:36.651
You want my place on the board.

43:36.772 --> 43:41.576
Is that it?
No.

43:43.217 --> 43:47.580
No?
No. I think it will be

43:47.660 --> 43:50.222
most productive for me to have a

43:50.343 --> 43:52.865
sympathetic ear in that quarter.
Don't you agree?

44:08.718 --> 44:11.320
Hey, Derek! Where are you goin',
mate? I thought we had a meeting.

44:11.345 --> 44:13.482
I've gotta be somewhere.
Right, what's happening?

44:13.601 --> 44:15.403
We're gonna have to
delay things for a while.

44:15.523 --> 44:18.166
Whaddya mean? What things, exactly?
All of it.

44:18.246 --> 44:20.607
Just for a while.

44:20.728 --> 44:22.930
Why?
The board wants to wait.

44:23.009 --> 44:24.451
Well, how long? The plan was to

44:24.570 --> 44:27.292
have Ferguson out by next week...
No, it could be a couple of months,

44:27.318 --> 44:29.880
alright?
What about my transfer, then?

44:31.335 --> 44:33.658
She got to you, didn't she?
She fuckin' got to ya!

44:33.738 --> 44:36.981
For Christ's sake, Fletch!

44:37.060 --> 44:38.502
Man up.

44:38.621 --> 44:41.705
You should be happy
you're leavin' this place.

44:46.668 --> 44:48.270
Fuck!
