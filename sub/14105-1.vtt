- Two dollars.

[chuckles]

01:20.122 --> 01:22.250
Officer Washburn, how you doing today?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.714
Ned, you always have
the most gorgeous rhubarb.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.878
It's Willie Nelson's poo
that gives it that glow.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.512
- My dog, Willie Nelson.
- Oh. [laughs] Hey, Willie.

01:31.675 --> 01:32.892
Is that true? [chuckles]

01:34.177 --> 01:37.101
Um... Listen, Ned...

01:37.264 --> 01:39.938
...you wouldn't happen to know where I
could get some, uh... [clicks tongue]

01:40.100 --> 01:42.353
- You know what I mean?
- What?

01:42.519 --> 01:45.648
Roll it up, toke it up, do it up.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.818
- Mary Jane...
- You know, officer... [laughs]

01:49.318 --> 01:51.537
...even if I did,
do you really think I'd tell you?

01:54.031 --> 01:55.032
Oh, uh...

01:55.949 --> 01:57.326
You're right, I'm sorry.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.205
It's... it's been a hard week,
you know?

02:02.331 --> 02:04.675
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.335
But, not your problem.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.213
You have a good day.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.482
Hey, thanks, man. Wow.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.319
- [laughs] How much do I owe you?
- Nothing.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.200
Seriously, I understand. I know
what it's like to have a hard week.

02:30.359 --> 02:34.239
Well, thank you, but I wouldn't
be able to enjoy it unless I...

02:35.781 --> 02:37.658
- [sniffs]
- [laughs]

02:37.824 --> 02:39.576
All right, if you insist. Uh...

02:41.495 --> 02:42.587
Twenty bucks.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.506
- Twenty bucks? [laughs]
- Yeah.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.751
- Put it back into the produce.
- Twenty bucks.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.262
- All right, thank you.
- Excellent.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.266
- You're under arrest.
- [laughs]

02:55.842 --> 02:58.436
- Really.
- [groans] Oh!

02:58.595 --> 03:01.269
- [laughs]
- You're under arrest.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.692
Oh, shit.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.861
Willie Nelson didn't do anything.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.071
It's gonna be OK, Willie Nelson.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.362
It's gonna be all right.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.077
So, Kaplan,
from Westbank Capital, right,

03:22.244 --> 03:25.589
he stands up, bids $25,000.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.251
This is like a $500 bottle of wine,
$480,right.

03:35.048 --> 03:39.098
- OK.
- Great, yeah. Good night.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.270
OK.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.275
- Take this off.
- [phone rings]

03:45.851 --> 03:48.104
Damn it. What?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.772
Jeremy, my pilot light's out again.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.073
Well, just use a match, you moron.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.735
Last time I did that
I almost singed oh' my eyeball.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.245
Will you just come up and
do the thing with the thing

03:57.404 --> 04:00.157

it'll take two minutes.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.917
Goddamn it.
OK, I'll be up in five minutes. OK?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.329
- What?!
- Are you having sex?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.000
- OK, I'll be right there.
- You're gonna leave right now?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.589
I'll be back in a couple of minutes,
I just have to help her out.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.174
- No.
- I'm a good neighbor.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.390
It's so depressing.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.442
Your friends from the law firm
will be here, right?

04:27.601 --> 04:30.445
Yeah, but it's casual Friday.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.277
OK, what does that mean?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.158
A lot of bad lawyer clothes.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.991
One of the things
about being the dumb, slutty one

04:38.153 --> 04:40.497
is that it gives you
a unique perspective.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.535
So, Ralph and I are doing it
on the ping pong table,

04:45.076 --> 04:46.749

05:09.059 --> 05:10.185
Hey.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.023
[laughs] Oh, my God.
What have you done to your vagina?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.703
It's a Brazilian.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.164
Bizarre.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.202

05:32.624 --> 05:35.252

- Hey, man.

Ned, this is Billy.
Billy, this is... Ned.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.966
Oh. I've heard a lot about you.
How's it going, Ned?

07:04.132 --> 07:07.352
Janet's told me a lot of stuff about
you. Some of it's pretty intense.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.640
I've made some changes
since you've been gone.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.020
I told her to tell you earlier,
but you know what she's like...

07:16.186 --> 07:18.314
Billy, you said you'd be supportive.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.857
- Sorry, man.
- it's all right.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.117

[Sighs] Wow, man.
Well... where do I go now?

07:34.704 --> 07:38.208
Ned, you had, like,
eight months to think about this.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.049
Yeah, but for eight months I thought
I was coming back here.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.009
I mean, I've lived here for three years.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.220
- I lived here before you lived here.
- it's not a contest!

when you don't use your head.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.602
Can you just think for a minute what it
was like for me these past few months?

07:52.764 --> 07:55.893
You? Well, you know, Where's...
Where's Willie Nelson?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.527
- Willie Nelson? Willie!

07:59.729 --> 08:02.903
- We'll be fine.
- But Willie Nelson is not your dog.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.410
Tim, who's my friend, left him here.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.993
Willie, who do you wanna live with?
Who do you wanna live with?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.496
That is so not cool, Ned.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.377
Are you seriously gonna
put that dog in that position?

08:14.953 --> 08:18.332
Look, I am really happy
that you got out of prison.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.217
But it is not fair to uproot
this animal. He loves it here.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.676
I'm not gonna uproot him.
I'm still gonna work here.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.808
Well, you think that Dave is gonna
take you back after what you did?

08:29.217 --> 08:31.970
- Well, I'm still taking him with me.
- Where?

08:33.596 --> 08:36.440
- Where, Ned?
- I...

08:36.599 --> 08:39.102
That's what I thought.
Come on, Willie Nelson. Come on.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.318
- Let's go.
- Come on! How can you do this to me?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.481

Well, she's been asking $400,

10:40.140 --> 10:43.861

give it to you for $500.

is get some money together

11:19.762 --> 11:23.517

- How much you need for the goat barn?

I'm sure we could rustle up
some cash for you?

11:34.569 --> 11:38.540

not to loan each other money.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.915
Yeah, no, right, obviously.

- Good! That's so exciting!

- Yeah, of course.

- OK.
- No, no, no, no.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.668
- Yeah. Who's Seth?
- I have a deadline. I'm gonna go too.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.505
What about cake? Aren't we
gonna play a game or something?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.510
[Dylan] We should probably
get going as well.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.048
Hey, sunshine, we gotta get home
and practice your shehnai.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.549
You're right.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.889
I'll out you a slice, River,
you can take it with you.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.554
Oh, no, he had a cupcake yesterday.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.398
We're off sugar today.
Thanks, though, Ned.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.982
[sister] Such a lucky kid,
gets a cupcake once a week.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.612
So, I'll see you guys next week, OK?

13:32.770 --> 13:34.864
- Bye, Mom!
- You guys really have to go so soon?

13:35.023 --> 13:36.570
It's still light out.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.906
I know, but I'm so psyched
to have you next week.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.196
- Yeah, to next week! Bye, guys.
- [Natalie] Cindy!

13:41.362 --> 13:44.081
- [Cindy] Coming, coming!
- [horn honks]

13:45.700 --> 13:48.169
Our door is always open, Ned.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.338
We'll see you next week, OK? Bye!

13:51.748 --> 13:53.091
Bye;

13:55.251 --> 13:56.969
You know, Nedly, I love you.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.263
I love you too, Mom.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.723
Even though you've never had a real job
and that problem with the jail business,

14:03.885 --> 14:06.638
and you've never given me
any grandchildren.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.723
Yeah, well...

14:09.932 --> 14:11.275
Any plans for tomorrow?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.861
I don't even know where to begin.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.274
Then we'll drive over to Calico Corner,
I gotta get a new button.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.612
- You need any?
- I'm OK.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.122
Let's get an early start,
we'll beat the crowds.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.999
OK.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.295
[sighs] I'm glad you're staying here.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.336
Nighty-night.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.423
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.838
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.935
[slowly] I'm... Officer...
Omar... Coleman.

14:51.766 --> 14:56.272
I'm... your... parole... officer.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.818
I'm Ned Rochlin.
Why are you talking so slow?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.906
I just figured, looking at your sheet,

15:03.069 --> 15:05.822
that since you sold grass
to a uniformed police officer

15:05.988 --> 15:07.490
that you must be retarded.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.537
- [laughs] Yeah, I get that a lot.
- Right.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.796
You need a signed rental agreement
in your name

15:13.955 --> 15:16.549
or written confirmation that
you're staying with a family member.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.507
OK. Well, currently I'm staying with
my mom in Long Island. Although, I...

15:20.670 --> 15:22.593
You're required to appear
before me every three weeks,

15:22.755 --> 15:25.508
at which time you'll provide me
with a urine sample. You understand?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.348
Oh, yes, sir, Your Honor.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.729
State of New York requires you
to reflect upon the choices

15:29.887 --> 15:31.434
that led to your incarceration.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.017
- Cool.
- Cool.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.778
Um, what steps are you taking to avoid
such choices in the future?

15:38.354 --> 15:41.699
Uh... I'll tell you,
that's really tough...

15:41.858 --> 15:44.407
...tough for me, sir. I don't really...

15:48.990 --> 15:50.162
Hmm. Hm.

15:50.992 --> 15:54.246
Wow, that's a good question. I don't...
It's tough to answer right now.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.210
I haven't thought about it
that much, but,

15:56.372 --> 15:58.625
I don't know. I mean, I'm not
gonna be working at the farm anymore.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.385
- OK.
- Although, you might not want to

16:01.544 --> 16:03.888
write that one down, 'cause it's
not so much a step, per se.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.299
Because it's not my choice.
I'd love to be working there,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.686
but my girlfriend, Janet,
doesn't want it to happen really.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.560
How about we put down you're staying
away from past criminal associates?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.730
- If you think that's best.
- Yeah.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.443
You know what? I'll think about it
and I'll try and come back next time

16:21.606 --> 16:26.077
with some more steps and options, that
kind of thing, for our next meeting.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.078
- You do that, buddy.
- This is cool, man.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.989
- Yeah.
- This is like...

16:30.156 --> 16:33.706
This is like free therapy.
New York State cares.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.754
Is that it? That's it?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.510
- That's it.
- My 50 minutes are up?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.716
- Yeah.
- All right, man. OK.

16:44.879 --> 16:45.880
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.887
Hey, is it lame if I bail on Nat's show?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.348
Yeah. Then no one will be there.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.684
What the hell is that noise?

16:53.846 --> 16:58.022
- Oh, that's River's shehnai.
- [croaking instrument sound]

16:58.184 --> 17:00.778
You have no idea how competitive
admissions have gotten.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.606
God, Ned just showed up.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.113
- I'll call you back.
- All right, bye.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.373
Hi.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.287
- You said your door was always open.
- I did, yeah.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.502
I hope this is OK, Ned.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.589
Are you kidding? This is great.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.722
My God, I get to rock
the full-on slumber party

17:27.880 --> 17:29.928
with my man River every night.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.352
I mean, Mom's great and all, but...

17:33.511 --> 17:36.606
Oh. No, Ned, it's all right. I get it.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.732
So, the deal is, if it's OK with you,

17:41.894 --> 17:46.320
you'll get $250 a week,
you'll help us out with River,

17:46.482 --> 17:50.612
and you get to work with Dylan
on the documentary.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.997
Yeah, I hope you don't have to fire
anyone to make room for me, Dyl.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.284
Oh, yeah, but it's family first, right?

17:57.660 --> 17:59.412
You guys.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.130
[grunts]

18:06.168 --> 18:08.512
[indistinct chatter]

18:12.341 --> 18:14.435
[Ned] Come on, bud, let's go.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.263
[percussive music plays]

18:26.105 --> 18:30.326
- [shouting]
- [River laughs]

18:34.739 --> 18:35.831
[both laughing]

18:35.990 --> 18:38.869
So, you're telling me
you've never seen The Pink Panther?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.833
Mom and Dad don't like violent movies.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.089
Yeah, but it's not violent,
it's hilarious.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.249
- Nobody's actually getting hurt.
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.169
Get on your feet. Come on, come here.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.180
On your feet, River Rochlin Byng.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.386
[karate greeting]

18:52.548 --> 18:54.801
Welcome to my dojo.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.594
Give me a chop.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.149
- What was that?
- Karate chop.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.233
That was a...? That wasn't a chop.
You know what that was? That was this...

19:08.397 --> 19:10.570
- Chop me. Do it.
- [laughs]

19:10.733 --> 19:13.202
- How about this?
- Oh! Ah!

19:13.361 --> 19:15.034
[laughing]

19:15.196 --> 19:18.871
Christ! it's after 10:00, for Christ's
sakes, River has school in the morning.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.754
Oh, God, sorry, yeah.
I must've lost track of time again.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.665
Ned, what's the laptop
doing in his bedroom?

19:25.831 --> 19:28.300
We were just watching Pink Panther.

19:29.627 --> 19:33.052
We loaned you the computer for your
resume, not to look at pink panthers.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.722
No, The Pink...
it's just Pink Panther.

19:36.884 --> 19:40.434
This country's obsessed with screens.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.525
He's seven years-old,
for Christ's sakes.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.277
- [crashing]
- Ahh.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.315
Whoops.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.704
- Good night, Riv.
- Good night.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.494
[Natalie] I mean, he's not
like a criminal or anything,

19:59.657 --> 20:02.160
he's just a fuck-up who needs help.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.125
Well, if he's got any of your genes,
I'd be happy to throw him a few bucks

20:05.287 --> 20:07.460
- to do a little modeling.
- That would be awesome.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.046
Then he'd have cash
and somewhere to go.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.589
Sure. Hey, have you heard
of Sustainable Upgrade?

20:15.589 --> 20:19.389
Sustainable Upgrade,
it's a life-coaching program.

20:19.552 --> 20:23.056
It saved me. I was like
your brother is now, floating.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.189
[laughs]

20:24.348 --> 20:27.101
Waiting for someone
to give me a sense of purpose.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.771
Cool, I'll tell him.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.280
Want to come to a meeting too?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.158
- Mmm, I don't know.
- No.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.820
You are capable
of extraordinary things, Natalie.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.537
You just have to let yourself go there.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.002
[laughs] it's not like a cult, is it?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.834
Cult? [laughs] No.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.004
No. I'll tell you what,
I'll take you both.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.840
Just check it out, no pressure.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.271
[classical piano music plays]

21:13.439 --> 21:16.192
What we're doing is we're
filming this documentary movie

21:16.358 --> 21:17.701
about Tatiana.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.034
And all of the artistic repression
that she faced in Belorussia.

21:21.197 --> 21:25.373
What I'd love to get from you guys would
be signatures on these releases.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.162
Thank you.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.832
[clears throat]

21:31.999 --> 21:34.673
- [Ned] Excuse me, ladies...
- Jesus.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.548
Ah! [laughs]

21:38.714 --> 21:39.761
- Man...
- [woman] It hurts.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.177
- [Ned] It does. It does, God!
- [woman] I know.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.845
I think I need leg warmers.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.060
- My Croc is stuck.
- Hey.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.317
- Hey.
- Is this joker bothering you?

21:49.475 --> 21:52.194
No, not at all. He's very cute.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.900
He's pretty funny.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.566
You wanna go grab the bags,
take them down to the car?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.826
Sure. I told her
you're my brother-in-law.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.611
She didn't know you were married.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.325
- Oh.
- No.

22:02.488 --> 22:06.459
You gotta look at this thing she can do
with her leg. This is amazing. Show him.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.958
- Look at...!
- I've just been shooting this stuff.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.373
But, hey, I never tire of it.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.965
[laughs] Look at this. I can get it...
This is how high I can go.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.093
[both laugh]

22:17.253 --> 22:19.927
I know. You just did it
five seconds ago.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.762
Oh, yeah. I didn't know if you saw it.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.760
Well, I've been here, like, 25 seconds.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.726
Oh. [laughs]

22:28.222 --> 22:30.566
- Go get the bags, wise-guy.
- [laughs]

22:30.724 --> 22:33.022
Well, sure thing. I'll go get 'em, boss.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.447
Seriously, go get the bags.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.778
Oh, yeah, yeah. OK.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.204
- [laughing, banging]
- [Ned] Ah!

22:44.280 --> 22:46.658
Oh, right in my gluteus maximus!

22:46.824 --> 22:49.293
- Get your stinky feet off me.
- Stop tickling me!

22:49.451 --> 22:51.579
[Ned] I'm not tickling you,
what are you talking about?

22:53.289 --> 22:56.042
So has Nat always been a lesbian?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.836
Oh, no, no, she's open
to pretty much anyone.

22:59.003 --> 23:03.133
Boys, girls, old, young, thin, fat.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.301
That's a beautiful thing, actually.

23:05.843 --> 23:09.518
- That is beautiful.
- She even slept with our cousin once.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.572
- [man] Dude! What the fuck!
- Sorry, sorry... to everybody.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.992
Man, can you hold this? Thanks.

23:40.127 --> 23:44.473
Thanks, man. I feel like an idiot.
[laughs]

23:47.509 --> 23:50.262
- You done yet?
- No, I still can't go.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.352
[Omar] Gotta get that sample.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.313
Hey, your two job's gonna look
good on my monthly stats.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.524
I'm telling you, Omar,
good things happen.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.156
- Good things happen.
- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Ned.

24:01.523 --> 24:05.528
Oh, now if you're gonna move into that
barn residence you referred to,

24:05.694 --> 24:08.413
you gotta register the address here
within three days of moving in.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.994
Oh, yeah.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.707
One more minute
or I'm getting the cranberry juice.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.712
Nope, almost there.

24:16.497 --> 24:17.965
There we go.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.968
- Oh!
- [laughs]

24:21.710 --> 24:24.884
Sorry, man, I shouldn't have gone
before I came here. I'm so stupid.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.344
I don't know what I was thinking.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.098
- That was funny, Ned.
- [laughs]

24:30.260 --> 24:32.354
- Yeah.
- You... [laughs]

24:33.222 --> 24:35.270
The car is now 35 minutes late.

24:35.432 --> 24:40.734
If the driver knew there was traffic,
why didn't the driver call me then?

24:40.896 --> 24:44.571
Yes, I know, but you see, I'm
interviewing a very important person,

24:44.733 --> 24:47.077
in less than 20 minutes and I...

24:47.236 --> 24:49.159
Don't...! [groans]

24:49.321 --> 24:50.994
Jer, see if he's out there for me.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.453
Yep-

24:52.908 --> 24:56.754
This is a disaster, Jer.
I cannot be late for this.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.965
- [sighs] Jesus Christ.
- No.

25:00.124 --> 25:04.049
[groans] I can't believe
I'm calling this person.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.713
Who is she exactly?

25:05.879 --> 25:09.474
Lady Arabella Galloway,
heir presumptive to the House of Stuart,

25:09.633 --> 25:11.635
one of the wealthiest women
in the world.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.928
Jesus.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.224
Yeah, her creepy ex-boyfriend stole
ten million dollars from the family,

25:16.390 --> 25:18.518
and then sold their sex tape
to pay his legal bills.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.403
He's a gem. OK, Ned,
you gotta do me a favor.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.439
First of all, we need to step on it,
we're really late.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.779
Next of all, maybe don't say
anything stupid.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.196
Actually, don't say anything at all.
Just keep your mouth shut.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.161
This is the first time I'm writing about
an actual person, not just moisturizer.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.791
So I really can't fuck it up.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.668
- Hi, Lady Arabella.
- Hi.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.678
- Miranda Rochlin, Vanity Fair
- Nice to meet you.

25:46.837 --> 25:50.467
So nice to meet you.
Here, just jump right in.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.803
So sorry that we were late.
The town car was stuck in traffic,

25:53.969 --> 25:56.142
- this is my sister's car, I had to...
- it's OK.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.182
- OK. I feel horrible.
- No, it's lovely to meet you.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.101
- Thank you, you too.
- Hi, I'm Arabella.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.863
You can introduce yourself, Ned.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.158
Oh, yes. I'm Ned.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.661
- I'm her brother.
- Yeah, he's just my brother.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.492
That's... that's all.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.076
So, are you two a team?

26:14.239 --> 26:17.334
Us? No. Hm-mm. No.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.416
I'm just kind of doing this
as an odd job.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.751
- Yeah.
- Been out of the workforce for a while.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.884
- Really? Where were you?
- Oh, I was sort of in jail.

26:25.042 --> 26:28.091
Oh. He's not a...
He's not a criminal or anything,

26:28.253 --> 26:31.257
he's just an organic farmer
that made a stupid mistake. So...

26:31.423 --> 26:34.017
- Well, biodynamic, actually.
- OK, Ned.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.180
What is biodynamic, exactly?
I've never understood the difference.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.474
Planting kind of depends
on the lunar calendar.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.688
- Species of lettuce, for example...
- Thank you, Ned.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.103
Arabella?
I was thinking we should get started.

26:44.269 --> 26:49.696
OK, my lawyer said you agreed not to ask
about him and the whole YouTube thing.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.700
Absolutely, yeah.
Everybody's dated a jerk,

26:53.862 --> 26:56.866
so at the end of the day,
that is just an old, boring story.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.452
- OK. Good.
- Yeah.

26:59.618 --> 27:05.296
No, what I'm truly fascinated by is the
work you are doing with Destiny's House.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.010
[Arabella] it's the same story
for all of them.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.889
Seduced at 13 or 14 by grown men
who make them feel loved

27:12.047 --> 27:14.846
and then brainwash them
into prostitution.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.515
- So sad.
- Yeah.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.602
Well, I guess we're all capable
of trusting the wrong person.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.563
Are you speaking
from personal experience?

27:23.725 --> 27:26.569
Hey, Ebony, thank you for the playlist.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.401
- Love Major Lazer.
- [girl] No problem.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.067
[Arabella] And then there's
Shanequa, she got really into boxing.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.736
Not just like boxing matches,
more like fight training.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.904
- Shanequa?
- [Ned] Yeah, you know my nephew River

27:36.071 --> 27:40.076
wants to do something like that, but Liz
won't have anything to do with it.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.665
- Is that the lesbian sister?
- [Ned] That's Nat.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.877
She's really more of a bisexual.
Or at least formerly-bisexual.

27:46.039 --> 27:50.089
I don't know how you describe it.
How would you describe Nat?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.172
- Arabella, I was wondering...
- [Arabella] If you guys are interested,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.215
you should come to the benefit
we're having on Sunday.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.601
- Benefit? Oh, yeah!
- The girls will be there.

27:57.759 --> 28:00.057
That could be great.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.064
- I do have this deadline, though.
- [laughs] Man, I love it.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.397
One minute I'm scrubbing toilets at
Marble Valley Regional with Dom,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.779
out to: I'm on the charity circuit.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.362
- [Ned sipping] Mm.
- [Arabella] it's good, right?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.572
- [woman] Are you convinced?
- Nice, nice.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.033
Way to tell it true, yeah.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.164
Anybody else? How about you? Beth?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.208
Share your story.

28:21.825 --> 28:22.826
Sure.

28:24.244 --> 28:27.748
Hi, everyone, my name is Beth Phillips

28:27.915 --> 28:30.213
and I'm from Paramus, New Jersey.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.924
- Hey, Beth.
- [Beth laughs]

28:33.086 --> 28:36.260
[Beth] Uh, I used to call myself
a romance addict.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.017
And then, I went in the win room.

28:40.469 --> 28:44.315
And came out knowing I just used sex
to make me feel like I was in control.

28:45.641 --> 28:49.862
But now, I'm engaged to marry a man
who actually loves me.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.732
He's so awesome.
He just knit me a scarf.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.196
[applause]

28:55.359 --> 28:57.953
[woman] isn't that a beautiful
testimony?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.656
Let's go to the win room.

29:01.156 --> 29:05.081
[Natalie] So now, um,
I'm in my crib and...

29:05.786 --> 29:10.542
...this time my sister's
not strangling me.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.548
She's hugging me and...

29:14.086 --> 29:17.306
I feel so positive
and, like, really, like, clear.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.058
Like I can do anything.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.179
- Yes, you can. You can do anything.
- [applause]

29:23.345 --> 29:24.972
That's a great win, Natalie.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.311
- Yeah.
- [man] It was beautiful.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.976
Hydrate.

29:34.189 --> 29:37.693
What about you, Ned?
What are you feeling?

29:38.652 --> 29:39.904
Uhh...

29:41.863 --> 29:44.366
I just... I feel really hot.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.457
Right. Do you want to expand on that?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.047
All I want is to take that pitcher
and just dump it

29:51.206 --> 29:53.709
onto my penis and balls.

29:54.334 --> 29:59.386
Move on through it. Come away from the
testicles and up to your higher self.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.097
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up in this tent.

30:02.259 --> 30:03.977
Can I please have water without win?

30:04.136 --> 30:07.015
Without a win? Can I please have water
without a win? Can you give me some?

30:07.180 --> 30:09.808
Don't enable him. Don't...

30:10.726 --> 30:12.353
Ned?

30:13.228 --> 30:15.276
- I'm fine, really.
- You're gonna be fine, man.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.909
- We just gotta take you in, all right?
- Are you sure I can't come? I want to.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.367
No, no, really. I'm fine. I promise.
You kids enjoy yourselves.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.907
And, seriously,
congratulations on your wins.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.288
I love you, Ned, bye.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.463
[sirens wails]

30:49.598 --> 30:53.478
[moaning]

30:59.524 --> 31:02.118
Cite Ohio v. McNally, Doug.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.120
Oliver Wendell Holmes 101.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.158
[laughs]

31:07.866 --> 31:11.666
Yeah, I'll be in in about 40 minutes.
We can talk about it then. OK.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.586
- You're so smart.
- Thanks, baby.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.719
- You really have to go?
- Yeah. I do.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.226
[car horns honking]

31:39.147 --> 31:40.569
OK...

31:42.484 --> 31:44.907
You know, Ned... Uh...

31:45.070 --> 31:48.244
...maybe you should wait here. I've got
to do an interview with Tatiana,

31:48.407 --> 31:51.206
- which could be a little sensitive.
- Really, how so?

31:51.660 --> 31:54.334
Well, it's too sensitive, you know,
even to discuss.

31:54.496 --> 31:57.466
- Wow.
- Why don't you chill out in the car,

31:57.624 --> 32:02.004
- while I go and do it.
- Yeah.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.844
- Do you need any help?
- No, just chill out in the car.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.474
All right.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.603
[siren wails]

32:22.858 --> 32:24.235
Come on.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.828
How we doing this evening?

32:26.987 --> 32:30.366
Good. Good. Everything's great, officer.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.000
I'm on parole.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.580
- Any trouble here?
- No, no trouble at all.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.208
My brother-in-law's doing a documentary
up in the building up there,

32:39.374 --> 32:41.047
and I'm just...

32:41.209 --> 32:44.008
This is my job, to watch this.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.673
No trouble, we're not breaking the law.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.841
You're in a 24-hour tow zone.

32:48.008 --> 32:51.057
You gotta move this vehicle,
tow truck's behind me.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.063
Well, all right.
Thank you for your service.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.024
Ahh.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.908
Just gotta get the keys!

33:12.824 --> 33:15.043
Dylan! Dylan!

33:18.914 --> 33:19.915
- Dylan!
- [gasping]

33:20.081 --> 33:22.755
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.262
I'm sorry,
I just really need the car keys.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.172
I told you never
to interrupt me when I'm working.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.263
Yeah, sorry about that, man.
I need the keys, we're gonna get towed.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.429
Wait, wait, wait. Why are they towing
the car? What the fuck did you do?!

33:33.595 --> 33:37.270
- I didn't do anything.
- That was your one responsibility, Ned.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.776
Your one responsibility!

33:45.774 --> 33:47.742
Hey, Tatiana. Sorry!

33:57.953 --> 33:59.705
[bicycle bell ringing]

34:04.960 --> 34:08.385
- Ned, interviewing is an art form.
- [car starts]

34:08.547 --> 34:13.018
When you ask someone to be vulnerable
or naked, you have to be naked too,

34:13.176 --> 34:15.804
to make them feel comfortable.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.018
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I guess.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.649
Great.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.984
- This piece is about Destiny's House.
- [sighs]

34:25.146 --> 34:27.319
We need more details about her.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.449
- This woman's been through a lot.
- I know.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.783
Robbie, we agreed
with the publicist not to go there.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.290
The publicist
is not writing this, Miranda.

34:35.447 --> 34:36.824
You are.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.496
Your job is to break through to her,
get her to show a little leg.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.710
- Come on, you're so charming.
- I know.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.876
You begged me
to get you this assignment.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.677
You want to get your first story killed?

34:52.674 --> 34:53.675
[sighs]

34:54.592 --> 34:57.062
It's just getting to be too much.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.437
River's interview is in three days time.
I want him to be...

35:01.600 --> 35:05.195
."enigmatic, erudite,
wise, incandescent.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.991
I can't just kick him out.
I'll talk to him.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.950
What, you just decided unilaterally?

35:14.112 --> 35:16.114
No, it's just he's family, Dylan.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.205
I can't just turn my back
on him for no reason.

35:22.370 --> 35:26.591
Well, can't one of you just take him,
please? He's driving Dylan crazy.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.503
No, all we have is that storage room
and Dan's friends from the Ukraine

35:29.669 --> 35:31.717
are staying there.
There's, like, six of them.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.180
I can't do it. I've got a crazy
deadline, I really need to focus.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.596
OK, well, thank you guys for your help.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.023
I need to find you.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.892
Cato!

35:44.059 --> 35:45.561
[grunting]

35:46.519 --> 35:48.738
What? Where did you go?

36:13.046 --> 36:16.300
- Hiya!
- [River screaming]

36:16.466 --> 36:18.343
[thumping]

36:19.260 --> 36:21.888
So, River, I like your name.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.898
It's better than Echo.

36:24.057 --> 36:26.651
- Echo?
- That's my sister.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.737
River was conceived in India,
near the Ganges.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.400
So what kind of things
do you like to do, River?

36:38.488 --> 36:39.956
- Fighting.
- Fighting?

36:40.115 --> 36:44.495
- [laughs] What kind of fighting?
- Kun Gek Do.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.924
River, why don't you tell Judith
about the shehnai?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.756
He's very, very good, actually.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.216
- When his hand has healed...
- Kun Gek Do.

36:54.379 --> 36:58.054
I've never heard of that one before.
Tell me about that.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.312
It's totally cool. Some of the moves
are just like Taekwondo.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.222
You know, kicking... [shouts]

37:04.389 --> 37:06.062
...and chopping. [shouting]

37:07.225 --> 37:11.071
What's special about it is that the guys
can also throw and choke you...

37:11.229 --> 37:14.073
- [Dylan] Whoa!
- [Liz] That's enough! I'm so sorry.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.452
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.159
Oh, God! [laughs]

37:20.321 --> 37:22.824
Riv, where'd you learn about this?

37:22.991 --> 37:26.837
- Uncle Ned and I found it on YouTube.
- YouTube? What?

37:26.995 --> 37:30.499
- Ned's so funny.
- Tell me about Uncle Ned.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.508
He just got out of jail.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.012
In Japan, for protesting about whales...

37:36.171 --> 37:38.344
...like the slaughter of whales.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.009
I thought you said
he sold drugs to a policeman?

37:41.176 --> 37:43.304
- Oh.
- [sighs]

37:44.137 --> 37:48.313
None of this would be possible
if it wasn't for this amazing woman,

37:48.475 --> 37:52.525
Rachel, who is a personal hero
to all of us girls.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.190
[applause]

38:03.573 --> 38:04.540
An right!

38:04.699 --> 38:06.246
It's lovely to see you. Thank you.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.663
- Arabella, hi! That was amazing.
- Thank you, Miranda.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.048
And you look great.
Whose dress are you wearing?

38:12.207 --> 38:15.507
- Mine.
- You're so clever.

38:15.668 --> 38:18.512
- Thanks for coming.
- Seriously, though, I'd love to know...

38:20.173 --> 38:21.550
[sighs]

38:21.716 --> 38:24.219
I don't understand.
So this cop, he just came up

38:24.385 --> 38:26.854
- and he had the hat, the badge...
- Yeah.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.857
Well, no, he didn't have a hat.
I just thought he was, like, you know...

38:30.016 --> 38:31.893
..."Brother, help a brother out,"
you know?

38:32.060 --> 38:33.562
- I don't even...
- [laughing]

38:34.395 --> 38:36.693
- You're laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.905
- You're totally laughing.
- I'm laughing at the story, not you.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.197
[chuckles] Here's the thing, I...

38:43.363 --> 38:45.240
I live my life a certain way.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.456
And that is that I like to think that
if you put your trust out there,

38:49.619 --> 38:51.747
I mean, if you really...

38:51.913 --> 38:54.757
...give people the benefit of the doubt,
see their best intentions,

38:54.916 --> 38:56.759
they're gonna want to live up to it.

38:56.918 --> 38:59.387
It doesn't always work out, clearly.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.425
But, more often than not,
I think that if you do,

39:03.591 --> 39:06.891
people will rise to the occasion.
I really believe that.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.851
It's very sweet, Ned.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.856
You think I'm an idiot
like everybody else.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.312
No, I don't think you're an idiot.

39:12.475 --> 39:16.230
I think that's a really good way
to live your life.

39:16.396 --> 39:19.775
I mean, I'm the same.
At least, I was, yeah.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.285
Until I met the fucking Chilean.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.863
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:25.572 --> 39:26.915
What happened?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.414
[elevator dings]

39:31.160 --> 39:34.790
So, I mean, I didn't stab him,
I just was trying to scare him.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.833
You must think I'm a total psychopath.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.968
I think you're fucking awesome.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.677
I do. Hey, you wanna
go out with me sometime?

39:43.464 --> 39:48.470
Oh. No, not really. But thanks for
asking. That's really sweet.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.065
[Liz] You should have seen him, Ned.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.318
He was flying around the room
like a maniac.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.025
I mean, Kum Kak Do,
is that what it's called?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.564
- Kun Gek Do.
- What?

40:00.398 --> 40:02.901
- Kun Gek Do.
- What were you thinking?

40:03.067 --> 40:06.788
Liz, every time he sees
those boys doing karate in class,

40:06.946 --> 40:08.493
you should see the look on his face.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.454
He so badly wants to be there.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.291
Dylan and I aren't interested
in those values, Ned.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.206
Sorry.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.716
You know, he's just a little boy.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.881
Little boys fight.

40:25.048 --> 40:28.643
Doesn't mean he's going to grow up
to be a frat-boy rapist.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.350
I'm sorry.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.603
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:53.701 --> 40:57.547
Here, Ned. It's just a little something.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.589
Look, I know you tried.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.754
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.299
No, no, no, I am.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.432
Wait, what?

41:08.591 --> 41:11.720
How much more do you need to move back
to that sheep farm, or whatever?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.103
Three hundred.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.860
- Oh, yeah, Ned.
- Oh, my God, are you...? Miranda.

41:21.229 --> 41:25.575
- Here you go, there's $300. Go home.
- Wait, Miranda.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.158
- Thank you so much.
- OK, I love that she paid you off,

41:29.320 --> 41:31.573
but not, like, the full amount. [laughs]

41:31.739 --> 41:35.209
Well, you know, she has her own way
of doing things.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.540
They both do, I mean...

41:37.120 --> 41:38.747
Hey, you wanna hear something weird?

41:39.872 --> 41:41.749
Do you know that Dylan
shoots in the nude?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.465
What? That's... disgusting.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.597
Well, I mean, not all the time,
just certain situations.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.599
Like, if Tatiana's nude,
then he has to be nude.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.228
- It makes her feel more comfortable.
- Why is Tatiana naked?

41:54.387 --> 41:55.934
Why is anybody naked?

41:56.097 --> 41:59.442
It's to shoot her scars of oppression,
or something.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.570
Oh, please. He's fucking her.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.992
[sighs] Man, I had a feeling about that.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.573
God, I just didn't want to believe it!

42:09.736 --> 42:12.660
- [gasps]
- I mean, all those humanitarian awards.

42:12.822 --> 42:16.292
I've got to call Nat. [gasps] Whoa!

42:16.784 --> 42:20.129
Hey, Dune's on Showtime,
director's cut. You want...?

42:20.288 --> 42:22.131
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.760
Sorry, didn't know you... had company.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.091
- No, he's nobody.
- If you're busy...

42:28.254 --> 42:29.881
That's my brother, Ned.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.096
- Oh, this is Ned?
- Yeah.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.727
- Ned! Hey!
- Jeremy, Ned. Ned, Jeremy.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.480
- Hey, man, Jeremy. Nice to meet you.
- How's it going? Nice to meet you.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.311
You, too, Jeremy.
I'll watch Dune with you.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.101
- Yeah? Me too.
- I love that movie.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.613
"Father, the sleeper has awakened!"

42:45.772 --> 42:47.445
You don't have to throw yourself
at him, Ned.

42:47.607 --> 42:48.824
"Father!"

42:48.983 --> 42:51.486
Hey, by the way, thanks for going
with Miranda to that benefit.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.326
- She always makes me do that shit.
- Oh, hey, man, it's all good.

42:54.489 --> 42:58.164
Jeremy finds it a burden to shave,
but he loves free food.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.079
- That's true.
- [Ned] I had a great time, actually.

43:01.245 --> 43:04.249
I tell you, that Arabella
she is one cool chick.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.010
She's so pretty and so smart
and funny and strong.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.969
My God, after everything she's been
through. All the humiliation with

43:12.131 --> 43:15.635
- the South American guy, stabbing...
- Nat, oh, my God. Guess... Wait.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.772
Hey, Miranda, do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?

43:18.930 --> 43:20.853
I'll call you back.
Ned, what did you just say?

43:21.015 --> 43:23.017
I said, "Do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?"

43:23.184 --> 43:26.358
No, no, no. Arabella and a stabbing?

43:26.521 --> 43:28.148
What did she tell you?

43:28.314 --> 43:30.533
Oh, I don't know. it's kind of private.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.319
- Ned, who just gave you $300?
- You.

43:33.486 --> 43:36.035
Yeah. Plus, I feel like you
just wanted to tell us.

43:36.197 --> 43:39.167
You were basically just practically
telling us the whole story.

43:39.826 --> 43:42.249
Come on, Ned, spit it out.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.002
Come on, Ned.

43:45.164 --> 43:49.010
She was in South America, there was
a stabbing, just give us the rest of it.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.228
[quacking]

44:03.391 --> 44:04.734
[clucking]

44:05.977 --> 44:07.979
[Growing]

44:08.563 --> 44:11.282
- The goat barn?
- Yeah.

44:11.440 --> 44:15.570
Ned, why would I want a past lover
living in my backyard?

44:15.736 --> 44:17.738
Billy said that you'd be cool with it.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.079
Oh, fuck, man,
I totally forgot to ask her.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.540
That's my bad, man, all the way.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.628
I understand. Look, you won't
even notice that I'm here.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.760
Ned, I'm so sorry,
it's not gonna happen.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.261
- [dog barking]
- Willie Nelson!

44:32.420 --> 44:35.094
- [barking]
- [Janet] Whoa.

44:35.256 --> 44:37.600
- Put Willie Nelson back in the house!
- What?

44:38.926 --> 44:40.678
[Billy] Janet said no.

44:42.430 --> 44:43.898
Sorry, man.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.686
- Come on, Willie Nelson.
- You're not gonna let me see him?

44:48.853 --> 44:51.777
You know what, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to say this,

44:51.939 --> 44:54.067
but I don't think you've
given me any other choice.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.947
How many times did you make me throw
Willie Nelson outside in the cold

44:59.113 --> 45:02.117
because you didn't want
mud tracked in the house, huh?

45:02.283 --> 45:05.878
How many times did you insult him
by telling him he had bad breath?

45:06.037 --> 45:09.382
Whoa, man, do you understand
that you come here to this farm,

45:09.540 --> 45:12.965
you put Willie Nelson
in the middle of all your bullshit,

45:13.127 --> 45:15.095
and you traumatize him.
Is that what you want?

45:15.254 --> 45:17.632
Why can't you just let him live
with someone who loves him?

45:17.798 --> 45:19.675
Stop with the violence, man!

45:20.468 --> 45:22.436
- You made me raise my voice.
- [softly] Sorry.

45:22.595 --> 45:25.519
I'm feel really affronted right now,
man, on my own property.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.433
Get your book bag, get out of here.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.023
You know what, you know what? Wow.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.816
Seriously, that is just...

45:34.982 --> 45:38.327
- I mean, come on.
- [sheep baa's]

45:50.164 --> 45:52.041
[toilet flushes]

45:52.208 --> 45:55.838
She's not even gonna budge unless
there's some sort of official action

45:56.003 --> 45:59.883
or something. Is there any kind of
motion, or like injunction or something

46:00.049 --> 46:01.551
that you can file? I mean...

46:01.717 --> 46:04.311
I don't know. I don't want
to sound conceited or anything,

46:04.470 --> 46:06.017
but I really am the better caregiver.

46:06.889 --> 46:11.816
You can sue her, but I'm not gonna let
that hippie bitch put you through that.

46:11.978 --> 46:13.195
You don't think we have a case?

46:13.354 --> 46:15.152
I mean, she's splitting hairs
when she says

46:15.314 --> 46:17.191
it was her friend Tim
that left him with us.

46:17.358 --> 46:20.362
Look, you have a case,
but you don't need one.

46:20.528 --> 46:24.283
That dog is yours and you're gonna go
back there and you're gonna get him.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.166
I don't think I can ask her again, Cin.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.043
No, no, no, Ned.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.714
We're not gonna ask, We're gonna take.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.716
- We?
- Yeah. Who's the man?

46:34.875 --> 46:38.220
- You are?
- Who's the man, Ned?

46:38.379 --> 46:40.632
Jesus. Me.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.641
Yes, say it. Who's the man?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.053
- Who's the man?
- No, say it... "I'm the man."

46:45.219 --> 46:47.438
- You're the man. I'm the man.
- You're the man! You're the man!

46:47.596 --> 46:49.519
- That's right. I'm the man.
- Say it! Say it!

46:49.682 --> 46:50.729
- I'm the man!
- Louder!

46:50.891 --> 46:53.394
- I'm the man!
- Yes! Come on.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.940
- [music plays]
- Pum!

46:58.065 --> 46:59.533
It's a sign.

47:01.027 --> 47:02.950
[indistinct chatter]

47:03.112 --> 47:05.331
[I Willie Nelson:
"Midnight Rider"]

47:05.489 --> 47:10.336
# I gotta run
to keep from hidin'

47:10.494 --> 47:15.170
.I' And I'm bound
to keep on ridin'

47:15.333 --> 47:20.590
# And I got one more
silver dollar

47:20.755 --> 47:23.383
# I ain't gonna let 'em
catch me, no

47:23.549 --> 47:24.516
# I ain't gonna let 'em catch
the midnight rider #

47:24.675 --> 47:25.801
- Hi.
- Hey.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.409
- Hey.
- [laughs]

47:42.985 --> 47:44.783
[mutters]

47:45.112 --> 47:47.581
Natalie says you haven't
had sex in like a year.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.368
She told you that?

47:50.534 --> 47:53.003
Max and I think you're really cute.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.206
Oh, uh...

47:56.290 --> 47:57.633
Thanks.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.043
Thanks, Max.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.893
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

48:25.194 --> 48:27.617
I'm sorry, I can't... I'm so sorry.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.123
I can't do it.

48:29.281 --> 48:32.876
I think your erection in my leg
totally threw me.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.959
I'm so sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.672
I'm so... I'm so...

48:41.669 --> 48:42.841
I'm sorry.

48:43.212 --> 48:46.011
- I'm such a jerk.
- You're really not a jerk.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.643
No, maybe I should've
tried harder or just...

48:50.136 --> 48:51.809
- You know.
- Ned.

48:51.971 --> 48:55.521
Dude, just 'cause you're straight
doesn't mean you're homophobic.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.653
I just feel bad, you know?
They seemed pretty into me.

48:59.228 --> 49:02.323
Well, they'll get over it. Let's...

49:02.481 --> 49:04.154
- We can look around this place.
- Thank you.

49:04.316 --> 49:07.536
- You're welcome.
- Let's try and find you one woman.

49:08.112 --> 49:11.537
- [Ned] Hm! She seems kind of fun.
- Yeah, sex would be awesome,

49:11.699 --> 49:13.497
but then she'd make you
go to rock shows.

49:13.659 --> 49:16.208
- Oh, sweet!
- Really?

49:16.370 --> 49:20.466
Sweet? You'd be psyched
to go to some rock club?

49:20.624 --> 49:23.468
See a band called, like, Paint Store...

49:24.378 --> 49:25.880
- ...or something?
- [laughs] Not really.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.889
No, you don't.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.468
What about those ones over there?

49:30.634 --> 49:33.057
[Jeremy] Lindsay and her friend,
they're gonna analyze every word

49:33.220 --> 49:34.642
of every text you ever send her.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.102
[Ned] I like the name Lindsay.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.812
[Jeremy] But they're both named Lindsay.

49:37.975 --> 49:41.479
Look what she's reading, it's like
a novelization of Us Weekly.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.862
- [laughs]
- [Jeremy] Exhausting.

49:43.022 --> 49:45.070
[Ned] Ooh, look at that one.
Look at that girl.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.779
[Jeremy] Oh, yeah, that would be great,
if you wanted, you know,

49:46.942 --> 49:48.535
to date your sister!

49:48.694 --> 49:51.447
- What's wrong with my sister?
- Nothing's wrong with your sister.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.912
Why, you wanna date your sister?
You're a wild man.

49:54.074 --> 49:56.577
No, I don't wanna date my sister.
But what about you?

49:57.369 --> 49:59.246
- Me? Date your sister?
- Yeah. Right.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.882
Miranda? What are you talking about?

50:02.041 --> 50:04.260
- Well, it's obvious.
- What's obvious?

50:04.418 --> 50:06.466
That you guys totally love each other.

50:07.588 --> 50:09.431
OK, I love Miranda, but...

50:09.590 --> 50:11.433
- I know.
- ...she's bossy.

50:11.592 --> 50:13.720
- [laughs] Yeah. She is.
- She's a bossy person.

50:13.886 --> 50:17.766
She's like, "Jeremy, help me move
everything in my apartment around?

50:17.932 --> 50:19.809
You know, it'll only take two minutes."
And then it's like...

50:19.975 --> 50:21.522
- [laughs]
- ...all day.

50:21.685 --> 50:24.655
I mean, she's great, she's pretty,
she's very pretty,

50:24.813 --> 50:28.408
that's undeniable,
but relationship-wise and...

50:30.027 --> 50:32.906
...pardon me, but sexually,
I don't know if I could deal with it.

50:33.072 --> 50:36.042
[sighs] Every man I meet
is either a dick or a loser.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.875
What about Jeremy? He's not a dick.
And he's not a loser, either.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.999
Well, that's debatable,
he doesn't even have health insurance.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.543
Neither do I,
at least I don't think I do.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.879
- [man] Here you go.
- I just want to meet a real man, Ned.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.640
I asked for that side-by-side,
not swirled. Thanks.

50:51.799 --> 50:52.800
- [man] Sure.
- Whatever.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.686
I mean you two are obviously
not headed in that direction.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.438
He thinks the idea
is as ludicrous as you do.

50:58.597 --> 51:01.191
Hey, man, can I try some acai berry?

51:01.350 --> 51:03.944
- [man] Yeah.
- Wait, wait. I'm sorry, what?

51:04.103 --> 51:07.152
- Why is that?
- I don't know, I don't know.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.612
What he said, it didn't make any sense.

51:09.775 --> 51:12.324
Why are we even talking about this?
Tell me what he said, Ned.

51:14.196 --> 51:15.994
He said you can be a tad bossy.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.284
[laughs]

51:18.450 --> 51:20.999
And you're not really his type,
physically. That was it, but...

51:21.161 --> 51:23.755
- Wait, what?
- Hey, man, how's pomegranate?

51:23.914 --> 51:26.337
- [man] it's terrific.
- Why, because I'm not 14?

51:26.500 --> 51:28.127
- [man] How's that?
- [laughing]

51:28.294 --> 51:30.046
Ned, tell me exactly what he said.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.180
- God, do I have to?
- Yes.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.316
[urinating]

51:53.902 --> 51:57.076
[sighs] Fuck.

51:57.865 --> 52:00.368
[indistinct chatter]

52:02.870 --> 52:06.420
- [Miranda] So, where's Dylan today?
- [Liz] He had to work.

52:07.708 --> 52:11.758
He's been so edgy and... distant.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.395
[sighs] Liz?

52:24.141 --> 52:25.393
Yeah?

52:26.685 --> 52:28.403
I think Dylan's having an affair.

52:30.356 --> 52:31.357
[laughs] What?

52:32.900 --> 52:35.744
- What are you talking about?
- Ned told me.

52:35.903 --> 52:38.247
Oh, yeah, OK, Ned. [scoffs]

52:38.405 --> 52:39.998
Let's face it, I mean...

52:40.157 --> 52:43.036
OK, Ned told me the facts.
I had to put it together.

52:43.744 --> 52:47.590
He said that Dylan
was spending a lot of private time...

52:48.415 --> 52:51.043
...with the woman in his film, Tatiana.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.715
- Tatiana, she's...
- Naked.

52:58.175 --> 53:01.429
Maybe it was some, like,
dance experiment or...

53:01.595 --> 53:03.222
[Miranda] Liz...

53:09.436 --> 53:12.485
- Do popcorn, Uncle Ned.
- In a minute, buddy.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.616
You sure she's gonna be at that concert?

53:14.775 --> 53:17.949
Yeah, she hasn't missed
a Dixie Chicks show in... ten years.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.706
And you're sure that she's
gonna leave Willie Nelson behind?

53:20.864 --> 53:23.663
According to Billy, she hasn't
taken him on an outing in months.

53:23.826 --> 53:26.045
- Poor guy.
- She's such a dick.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.046
- [River] Come on, Uncle Ned.
- All right, Riv, let's go.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.297
On your back.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.884
- [River laughing]
- [Ned] Ah!

53:36.046 --> 53:37.047
Yeah!

53:38.924 --> 53:39.720
Yeah, baby!

53:39.883 --> 53:43.888
[Miranda] His whole "I'm saving the
world" thing, it was bullshit, right?

53:44.054 --> 53:46.603
- We always knew it. Fuck him.
- Yeah, fuck him.

53:46.765 --> 53:48.813
And his little Russian
ballerina bitch.

53:48.976 --> 53:52.355
This is the man I built my life with,
what do you expect?

53:52.521 --> 53:55.491
That I just... throw it all away
or something?

53:55.649 --> 53:57.902
- No. I don't know.
- Maybe.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.536
Damn Ned!

54:00.112 --> 54:02.956
- I never should have let him stay.
- This is not Ned's fault.

54:03.115 --> 54:04.992
Everything was going fine
until he arrived.

54:05.159 --> 54:08.914
- [Miranda] How is this Ned's fault?
- A family is a very precarious thing.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.673
You guys will see
when you get it together.

54:11.832 --> 54:13.584
[weeping]

54:14.209 --> 54:17.008
OK, Liz, look.

54:17.171 --> 54:18.673
Don't take this the wrong way,

54:18.839 --> 54:22.514
because Dylan is totally
the asshole in this situation for sure.

54:22.676 --> 54:25.304
- He's a douche bag.
- I hate his guts. But...

54:25.471 --> 54:27.439
...is it possible that...

54:28.974 --> 54:30.817
...you know, maybe he
thought you gave up?

54:31.977 --> 54:33.354
Gave up on what?

54:34.855 --> 54:36.232
You're, you know, this whole...

54:37.357 --> 54:41.703
You used to be so hot, Liz. I remember
all my friends lusting after you.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.035
- They thought you were awesome.
- Yes! You had the great boobs,

54:44.198 --> 54:46.542
- and you were always tall and...
- You're still tall.

54:46.700 --> 54:50.204
- Yeah.
- Well, what's wrong with me now?

54:51.789 --> 54:53.211
[Miranda] Well, come on...

54:53.373 --> 54:57.094
Liz, I mean, look. I don't know.
What's going on with your hair here?

54:57.252 --> 54:59.550
It's like a science experiment
back there.

55:00.088 --> 55:03.592
And I know you own contacts.
You're wearing plastic shoes,

55:03.759 --> 55:05.932
and what is this shirt even made of?

55:06.929 --> 55:09.808
- it's flax.
- See? I mean, isn't that a food?

55:09.973 --> 55:12.442
- You're wearing food.
- What are you saying?

55:12.601 --> 55:15.480
- If only I looked more like you?
- What? No.

55:15.646 --> 55:21.073
Got my hair styled every day and wore
absurd heels that no one can walk in,

55:21.235 --> 55:24.079
that maybe my husband wouldn't
be screwing around on me?!

55:24.238 --> 55:26.957
I'm just trying to help!
OK, Liz? That's all!

55:27.115 --> 55:29.209
I hardly think you're in a position
to give man advice!

55:29.368 --> 55:31.587
Jesus Christ, you guys,
all Miranda's saying is just,

55:31.745 --> 55:33.998
like, maybe it would be cool
if you just, like,

55:34.164 --> 55:35.757
looked semi-fuckable once in a while.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.793
- Thank you!
- Oh, God!

55:37.960 --> 55:40.088
I mean, how long has it been
since you've had sex?

55:40.254 --> 55:43.554
I don't know! Echo's five months,
so, you know...

55:43.715 --> 55:45.513
- Plus nine, it's like...
- What?!

55:45.676 --> 55:47.428
- Plus nine?!
- Are you kidding me?

55:47.594 --> 55:51.474
That's, like, over a year!
How can people live like that? That's...

55:51.640 --> 55:53.267
I am different from you.

55:53.433 --> 55:56.607
I have other things to do than
worry about getting my rocks off.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.489
[scoffs] What is that supposed to mean?
You think I'm sleeping around?

55:59.648 --> 56:01.776
- I'm not sleeping around!
- Nobody thinks that.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.910
- I didn't say that.
- I love Cindy.

56:04.069 --> 56:07.369
- This isn't about you, Nat!
- it's just seduction is your thing,

56:07.531 --> 56:10.080
- your means to self-esteem.
- Ohh!

56:10.242 --> 56:12.461
- I don't care!
- Screw you and screw you!

56:12.619 --> 56:15.498
What did I do? Nat!
What is up your ass?!

56:20.377 --> 56:22.220
Babe, you OK?

56:22.754 --> 56:25.052
- You're all sweaty.
- Babe.

56:25.674 --> 56:29.304
[Ned] They just dump everything on it,
sprinkles and like Oreos.

56:29.469 --> 56:34.020
- What about sunflower seeds?
- They're actually good.

56:34.182 --> 56:35.308
- They're good?
- Yeah.

56:35.475 --> 56:36.476
- What about...
- [crying] River, come on.

56:36.643 --> 56:37.815
Sweetie, come on.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.401
Come on, it's time to go, come on.
[sniffles]

56:40.564 --> 56:41.907
Come on.

56:42.065 --> 56:44.193
- See ya, buddy.
- See ya.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.866
Hey, Riv, check it out.

56:48.947 --> 56:49.994
[laughing]

56:50.157 --> 56:52.159
Grow the hell up, Ned.

56:59.791 --> 57:00.587
[elevator dings]

57:04.004 --> 57:07.053
Hey, read it last night.
Quite the story.

57:07.841 --> 57:10.344
PR thinks it's gonna get you
on a bunch of talk shows.

57:13.722 --> 57:15.520
[Miranda]
Oh, now you're MIC Moral High Ground?

57:15.682 --> 57:16.808
[Jeremy] No, I didn't say anything.

57:16.975 --> 57:21.105
I love my brother, but let's be honest,
he doesn't live in the adult world.

57:21.271 --> 57:25.071
Oh, but your story's adult
with all the gory details

57:25.233 --> 57:28.954
- and bitching aside?
- Sometimes in the adult world

57:29.112 --> 57:31.956
we have to do things that,
you know, we're not very pro...

57:32.115 --> 57:34.209
Let's just drop it,
because you wouldn't understand.

57:34.368 --> 57:36.871
I wouldn't understand?
Why wouldn't I understand?

57:37.037 --> 57:39.005
Why, because I'm an unpublished
sci-fi writer?

57:39.164 --> 57:42.464
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, no, that's not it. That's not it.

57:42.626 --> 57:46.005
It's because I don't have health
insurance. That's what it was.

57:46.171 --> 57:49.675
- Did Ned...? I'm gonna murder him.
- I don't know how I found that out.

57:49.841 --> 57:52.560
- He's...
- Are you helping at all?

57:52.719 --> 57:54.721
- I'm guiding it.
- You're guiding it?

57:54.888 --> 57:58.188
- Someone has to guide...
- Let go. You weren't doing anything.

57:58.350 --> 58:01.194
- That's what he said?
- [Miranda] Hey, Ned!

58:01.353 --> 58:04.527
Really? You had to go and tell Jeremy
about that little stupid thing I said

58:04.690 --> 58:07.318
about the health insurance?
Why are you such a blabbermouth?

58:07.484 --> 58:10.408
Is that my brush? Ew!
What are you doing?

58:10.570 --> 58:11.787
I don't wanna know.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.073
Uh...

58:13.240 --> 58:16.961
I'm surprised that you even asked
my opinion on your work,

58:17.119 --> 58:20.589
since... Wait, I'm not even a grown-up?
Is that what it was?

58:20.747 --> 58:22.340
Ned! That...

58:22.499 --> 58:25.218
OK, what you don't understand
is that my brother is a retard.

58:25.377 --> 58:26.424
- [Jeremy] Oh, OK.
- That's true.

58:26.586 --> 58:27.712
[Miranda] See? Thank you.

58:27.879 --> 58:31.099
No, I mean, she didn't say that at all.

58:31.258 --> 58:33.260
What she was that
you're not like a real man.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.224
- Ned! Wait!
- That's much better.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.606
- No...
- That's great. Thank you, Miranda.

58:37.764 --> 58:40.438
Oh, no, no, no, no! This is just...

58:40.600 --> 58:42.694
This is just a breakdown
of communication.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.527
- Obviously. Really nice, Miranda.
- Don't try to make me feel bad

58:45.689 --> 58:49.410
about any of this when, according
to you, I'm... What was it, Ned?

58:49.568 --> 58:52.117
- ...hideously ugly.
- What?

58:52.279 --> 58:53.747
- Yeah.
- I didn't say that.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.748
Miranda, I would never
say that about you.

58:55.907 --> 58:59.081
- He so didn't say that about you.
- Thank you, tell her I didn't say that.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.544
He said your personality gets in the way
of your looks, your very good looks.

59:02.706 --> 59:05.380
Dude... do you have Tourettes?

59:05.542 --> 59:07.636
- What the fuck?
- Wow.

59:07.794 --> 59:09.296
This is much worse
than I thought it was.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.966
- I didn't say that.
- I don't even know why I care.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.976
Because the idea of the two of you
sitting around, talking about girls,

59:15.135 --> 59:17.263
is so pathetic, it's almost funny.

59:17.429 --> 59:18.772
It's almost funny?

59:18.930 --> 59:20.352
I don't see you laughing right now.

59:20.515 --> 59:22.984
It doesn't seem like
you think it's funny at all.

59:24.186 --> 59:27.065
OK, um, here's your story.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.655
Thank you for letting me read
your wonderful article.

59:31.276 --> 59:33.495
Hope you sleep well. Ned, you might
wanna take a look at that.

59:34.780 --> 59:36.532
- See you later.
- Jer.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.876
- Give me that, Ned!
- [door slams]

59:40.035 --> 59:41.503
[sighs]

59:42.829 --> 59:45.833
Keep your mouth shut, Ned,
just keep it shut!

59:45.999 --> 59:47.672
- Sorry.
- He's like my best friend.

59:47.834 --> 59:49.962
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm sorry.

59:50.128 --> 59:53.723
This is like in prison
when I told Bob about Jose.

59:54.716 --> 59:56.810
I'm pretty sure it's nothing like that.

59:56.968 --> 01:00:01.519
I mean, is there anything
more bothersome than a morn cliché?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.683
Mom's heart is in the right place.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.022
- Mom means well.
- [chuckles]

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:09.691
Or, the crowning glory
of terrible mom clichés...

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.531
I mean...

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.701
Um...

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.124
I'm gonna be...

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.170
...right back.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.473
[Natalie] What?

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.430
Nat, are you all right?

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:42.976
Are you sick?

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.900
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.161
Oh, my God, that...!
Congratulations, man!

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.447
That's so awesome for you guys.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.200
God, what do I fucking do?

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.752
Well... this sounds weird,

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.084
but do you think you're not as much
of a lesbian as you thought?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:12.003
No! No, it was just a thing.
God, I fucking love Cindy.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.130
You know... just tell her the truth.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:18.425
She loves you.
Maybe she'll be psyched to have a kid.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.310
What? Yeah,
she's gonna be really psyched.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:24.063
She's gonna come with me to pick out
a fucking changing table. Come on!

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.442
I cheated on her, I got pregnant,
she should be pissed.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.399
I don't Wanna fuck it up with her, Ned.

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:31.279
If she loves you, she'll forgive you.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.983
I can't have this child.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.326
[moans]

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:40.705
- Holy shit, I've destroyed my life.
- [thunder rumbles]

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.791
- You're having an affair, aren't you?
- [chuckles]

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:50.958
- With Tatiana.
- With Tatiana, are you crazy?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.593
Who gave you that idea?

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.506
- Your ludicrous brother?
- What does it matter?

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.302
Apparently, you're shooting
the movie naked.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.142
- What?
- Even the way you say her name.

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.727
- [scoffs]
- Tatiana.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.484
You know, you have
this amazing talent

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.611
for making me feel
like a second-class citizen.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:17.239
- What do you mean?
- I mean, in your own meek, mousy way

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.371
you have this brilliant knack
of getting your own way.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.912
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:30.088
[sobs] Wait, what does this
have to do with you and Tatiana?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.875
I never wanted him here,
but you insisted that he stay,

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.796
even making me feel like a criminal for
suggesting that he stay somewhere else.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:41.138
This is bullshit, Dylan.
You're completely evading the issue!

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.811
It's not a trick question.
Are you or aren't you sleeping with her?

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:47.852
[sighs]

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.359
What are you doing?

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:02.871
I'm leaving this house
before you make me lose my temper

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.781
in front of my children.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.619
[sighs]

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.636
You couldn't wear pants, Ned?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.469
OK, I took the liberty
of writing up a checklist,

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.850
if you could read it over carefully,
please.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.261
That's just the checklist, Ned.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.151
Wait, you put all
of this in your article?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.563
- That stuff was private.
- Well...

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.606
Did she ever say it was off the record?

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.696
Why would she say it was off the record,
we were just having a conversation.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:44.784
Ned, come on, she knew
you and I were a team.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:47.533
She called us a team
the first time that we met.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.246
Yeah, and then you said
we weren't a team.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.082
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.872
I remember precisely,
'cause I thought it was pretty mean.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.133
I dropped everything
to drive you around that day.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.259
All the documentary guys
were going for dim sum.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:01.467
You know what?
The important thing at this point

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:04.929
is whether this information is true.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.968
It's all we need to know, Ned.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.762
Is this true?

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:13.934
I'm gonna bring Darren in on this.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:21.066
Fuck. Fuckity-fuck, Ned,
she's getting a lawyer.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.735
How could you do this to a person?
That's so messed up.

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:28.703
How can you do this to me?
Just say "Yes, this happened."

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.119
You're not even lying or anything.
It is true, so just...

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:36.461
Fuck. Look, Ned, I am begging you.
Don't fucking do this to me, please?

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.876
Come on. All right, here they come.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.419
Hi, Darren, how are you?

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:45.557
Ah. I'm not happy at the way this
story's been put together, Miranda.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.932
[Robbie] I'm not either.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.595
You'll have to vouch for the veracity
of the story yourself, Ned.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.310
- Like right now?
- That's right. Right now.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.099
I need to hear it.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.277
[sighs]

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.656
- Hey, Miranda.
- Hey, Ted.

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.708
- What the fuck is Wrong with you?
- Ahh!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.423
- You couldn't just fucking say yes?
- Sorry.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.553
How could you do that to me, Ned?

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.756
[elevator dings]

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.971
[scoffs] Miranda's such a bitch
sometimes.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.138
I feel kind of bad,
it was a big opportunity for her.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.806
For what?
Selling her soul for a story?

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.351
There was just
a breakdown of communication.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:38.939
Whatever.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.948
Looks like you found a use for
your mom's post 9/11 escape raft.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:44.699
It's cool. Sleep well, bud.

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:50.204
- Tomorrow, Operation Free Willie.
- Right on.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.032
Have a good night.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.701
If you get cold,
there are coats up in the...

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.836
- Oh, OK.
- Oh, and if you need to pee?

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:59.623
- There's a kitty litter box right here.
- [laughs]

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.008
Nat.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.175
- [whispers] How's it going?
- Oh. Great.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:09.056
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Thanks so much for your advice.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.889
- Oh, my God. For sure. No.
- That was awesome.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:15.521
I mean, she's being exceptionally cool.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.560
She is exceptionally cool.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:22.855
- [Cindy] Nat, where are my ear plugs?
- Night, Ned.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:24.860
Night, Nat.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:25.990
[# Willie Nelson: "OI' Blue"]

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.618
# I had a dog

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:31.746
# And his name was Blue

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:34.408
# I'll tell you what

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.919
# OI' Blue would do

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.171
# Yeah, Blue

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.004
# Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.924
# He'd go out

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:50.090
# Every night about dark

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.930
# And it wouldn't be long

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.220
# 'Til you'd hear him bark

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:59.016
# Yeah, Blue

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.310
# Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue #

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.905
[engine shuts off]

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.950
[Ned] No way, they're home!

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:18.959
Jesus, what do we do?

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:21.416
We go get Willie Nelson.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.130
[Billy] Are you mad about
the rooster thing?

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.465
[Janet] Well, a little bit mad
about the fucking rooster.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.676
[Billy] Well, I'm telling you,
he's depressed.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.468
And I'm telling you, there's no fucking
way a rooster is depressed, Billy.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:38.730
[Billy] When animals are depressed, man,
they, like, sleep more.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.390
[whispers] Sorry, didn't mean to touch
your boob.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:44.437
[Billy] Humans do it, roosters do it,
then they don't crow in the morning.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.229
- That's why I overslept.
- I'm so psyched

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.572
- you and Nat weathered that storm.
- Yeah, We're good. We're good.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.987
And to power through infidelity,
man, you can do that,

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.826
you can do anything.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.491
Oh, come on!

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.834
Locked? She locked it?

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.632
Hold on. Right here.

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.844
[grunts]

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.602
Come in.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:24.189
Hey, you know, that Christian, he's kind
of lame, but he's really handsome.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.024
So there's a good chance your baby
is going to be very striking.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.779
- [barking]
- Oh!

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.613
Buddy!

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.618
[kissing] I missed you so much!

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.782
Hey, Nat. Oh, no,
I'm just with your brother

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.042
and he just told me some real
interesting news.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.202
- No!
- Nothing,

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.212
just that you're apparently pregnant

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:49.421
with the spawn
of that fucking cult-y fuck fuck!

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:53.212
- [barking]
- Yeah, sure. She wants to talk to you.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.051
- [barking]
- [Ned whispering] No, no.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.555
- Hello?
- Oh, shoot.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:02.313
- Hey, Nat. Now's not a great time.
- [Janet] Who's here?

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.689
Janet, hey, what's up?

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:07.227
- Can I call you back?
- Jesus Christ.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.020
- Yeah, it's me!
- What's going on, how's it going?

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:13.567
- [Cindy] You don't sound very sorry!
- You thought you'd come and take him?

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.202
- Who the fuck is this?
- [Cindy] You're gonna blame Ned?

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:18.488
That's your tactic? [laughs]

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.955
OK, I really didn't want to get
litigious, but I brought a lawyer.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:26.462
[Cindy] I am sorry I don't have a fat,
throbbing cock for you!

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.544
That's some Ivy League
shit out there, man.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.379
- [Cindy] Really?
- Cindy!

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:34.511
You wouldn't, would you, Nat? 'Cause
you're fucking selfish, that's why.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.094
No, no, no! I wanna
talk about this now, damn it!

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.805
- I need your help, Cindy. Could you...?
- Really? An accident?!

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:42.470
An accident is when you
fall off your fucking bike!

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.106
- Not when you fuck somebody!
- Hey, Ned. What's up, man?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.768
- Hey, man.
- Caught the master criminal here

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.108
trying to steal Willie Nelson.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.274
What happened
to the Dixie Chicks show?

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.411
The Dixie Chicks? That's next Thursday.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.367
- Right, Janet?
- Yeah.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.874
- Next Thursday.
- When I talked to you last week,

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:07.287
- you said it was next Thursday.
- Oh. It is. Next Thursday.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.922
Yeah, but when I talked to you a week
ago, you said "Next Thursday."

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.253
I'm thinking, today.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.794
So it's better for you
if I say "Next, next Thursday"?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.713
It's not better now. I thought you were
gonna be at the Dixie Chicks concert.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:21.305
Yeah, but just for future reference,
like for concerts in the future.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.310
- What, are you guys fucking?
- [car door slams]

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:26.769
Oh, God! Cindy! Cindy!

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:32.358
Oh! Dude! Man, there goes my ride.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.945
That's OK, I can give you a lift.
Or no, I can't.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.954
This can't be happening.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:45.333
I never should have let Ned stay here.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.084
What about what Ned did to me?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:51.168
I take him to work, he hangs me
out to dry in front of everyone.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.174
Hang on,
I'm getting call waiting. Hello?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:57.883
Our idiot brother
just ruined my fucking life.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.509
You know you'll always
have a place here with me.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.552
Thanks, Mom.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.351
I thought the girls
wouldn't want you hanging around,

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:11.313
they've got too much stuff going on
to bother with people like us.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.865
All right then, that's it.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.072
I will see you in three weeks.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.822
Hey, you know,
I've been meaning to tell you.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.286
You're doing
a really good thing here, Omar.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:30.545
- [laughs]
- Seriously. You talk to us screw-ups,

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.331
you give us a reason
for getting out of bed in the morning.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.795
Thanks, man.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.962
So you get out of bed again
in another three weeks, OK?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.631
- [Chuckles] I'll do it.
- I appreciate the compliment.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.472
It's rare that we get love
from the clients.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.557
Well, you're a good dude.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.099
And I just needed this appointment
today, I'm having a tough go of it.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:55.486
I swear, I try and do good,
but I just screw it up.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:59.194
Man, I screwed it up with my sisters,
I'm back living with my mom.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.736
On top of it all, I broke down
and smoked a joint

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:04.404
with the kid that lives
across the street.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.992
OK, I didn't just hear that.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:09.580
I said I broke down and smoked a joint
with the kid who lives across...

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.211
What are you doing?
Hey! Ned, why are you telling me this?

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.465
I just need to unload, man.
That's part of why I'm here, right?

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:20.003
I'm not your therapist, Ned. You don't
tell your parole officer you got high.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.423
Now I have to report you
or else I could lose my job.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:29.763
Seriously? Can you forget I said that?

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.434
- No, Ned, I can't.
- Oh, fuck.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.897
[sighs]

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.562
[toilet flushing]

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:40.569
You OK?

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.943
[mother] it's an ulcer, I'm telling you.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.783
Too many late nights.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.039
Did you call Dr. Silverman?

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.949
I Will.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:54.458
Oh, yeah,
it's my fault you're throwing up.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.624
- [mother] Who's ready for charades?
- Me!

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.634
Mom, nobody's in the mood.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.841
[mother] Great,
go and get the pens and paper.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.507
Television show.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:07.095
Three words.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.183
Gimme A Break.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:15.104
- That was quick.
- I put it in.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:16.767
All right, guys.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.028
River, this one's for you.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.657
All right, River, come on!
Here we go!

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:29.823
Wizard of Oz.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.742
- Yeah.
- [Liz] Well done, sweetie.

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:36.212
I guess it's me.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.671
OK, it's a movie.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.090
Space?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.971
Space, space, Star Wars!

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.553
- Space... No.
- [River] Space Frogs!

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:51.344
- Crazy Hands!
- Good, Crazy Hands?

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.104
Crazy Heart.
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love."

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.016
- Uncle Ned!
- Me. Ned, Ned. Nedly, Nedrick.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:14:00.312
- Me, me, Ned!
- Why aren't you guys guessing?

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:02.526
- The Jerk?
- Har har.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.531
- OK, guys, come on, guys.
- Jackass.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.692
[Natalie] You wanna get in on this
party, Liz?

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:09.362
The Man Who Just Ruined My Marriage.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.165
Don't forget Lassie.
'Cause you miss your doggie.

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:14.371
- Ha ha ha ha.
- [girls laughing]

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:18.379
- Can you please just play the game?
- We are playing.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.130
No, you're not playing,
you're not at all.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.211
- We are.
- [Ned] No, you're not.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.251
- Yeah, we're kind of playing.
- [Ned] You're kind of not playing.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.717
- Those were great guesses, I thought.
- When you put your own clue in,

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.301
you're not allowed to guess.
You know that.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.887
- I bent the rules.
- You didn't bend the rules.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:35.351
You broke them and that just
ruins it for everyone, all right?

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:36.935
I know you've got a really
important life, Miranda,

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:41.399
but some of us like to sit around, enjoy
our family, and play a game of charades.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.982
[laughing]

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.898
What's so funny, Nat?
By the way, when a kid goes,

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.818
you should at least give him
the opportunity to act out his hint.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.579
All right? Before you jump in
with the answer, even if you know it.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:55.082
It's the same stupid clue
Mom always puts in for River.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.916
So what? You're so cool,
you're just too bored, is that it?!

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.752
For God's sake, Ned, we have
other things on our mind.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.257
So you make it miserable for everybody?

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:06.420
- OK, Ned, we're gonna play.
- Let's get serious, girls.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:07.928
Just play the fucking game!

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.384
[chatter silences]

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.553
Goddamn it, I just want
to sit around with my family

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:16.562
and play a fucking game of charades!

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.571
I just wanna sit
and I just wanna play the game.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.452
I wanna play charades,
what's the big deal about that?

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.658
Why can't you all just play?

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.832
[doorbell rings]

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:41.291
Sorry, Riv.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.965
- [Omar] Hello, Mrs. Rochlin?
- Yes.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:51.388
Officer Omar Coleman. Is your son home?

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:54.471
He was just frustrated, officer.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:57.307
He gets very excited
playing parlor games.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.188
It's under control now.

01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:00.973
- Oh, my God.
- Omar.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.567
Mr. Rochlin, sir,
I suggest you step outside.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.365
[Miranda] What's going on?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.537
- [man] Nedrick Rochlin?
- Yeah.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:19.625
- You made bail.
- Really? Who?

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:25.002
Miranda Rochlin. Just sign here,
we'll process you out.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:35.850
- No, I'm good.
- What?

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.851
No, thanks. I'm gonna stay here, man.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.353
Thank you.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.735
Look, there's nothing I can do.
He refused to sign.

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:49.522
- This is classic Ned.
- Officer, I'm his mother.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:52.862
Just bring him out here.
He probably doesn't understand the form.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.572
That's not how we do it, ma'am.

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:58.410
- Can I speak to your supervisor?
- No.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.868
Mom, if he doesn't want to be
released to us, we can't force him.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:06.005
Excuse me, sir, would it be possible
for my son to see him?

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:10.877
I know you're really mad at my mom
and Aunt Natalie and Aunt Miranda.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.546
But they all feel really sorry, I swear.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:18.726
River, I want you to go tell your mom
and your aunts something for me, OK?

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.136
Sure, Uncle Ned.

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:23.394
- Go fuck yourselves.
- River!

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.729
That's what he said.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:38.071
Hey guys, I know how to get Uncle Ned
to leave prison.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.392
- Well, hello.
- [engine shuts off]

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.437
- Hi.
- [Janet] The Rochlin girls.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.696
This is a pleasant
and unexpected surprise.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:19.283
- The farm looks beautiful, Janet.
- Oh, thanks, Liz.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:22.995
So, what brings you all up here?

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:24.408
Um...

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:29.626
We were practically family, Janet.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:32.712
And we thought... um...

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.387
...it would be good
to get some closure, you know?

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.297
Yeah, that and we came for Ned's dog.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:42.185
[laughs] So he roped
the whole family in, huh?

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:46.143
Well, forget it.
Willie Nelson isn't leaving.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.144
It's what's best for him.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:52.028
Janet, Ned needs
Willie Nelson's company right now.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.322
- Emotionally...
- Look,

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:58.485
I'm not giving that
irresponsible man-child my dog.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.449
Come on, Janet, it's just a dog.

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:02.989
Uh... to you, maybe, Natalie.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.157
To me, Willie Nelson
is a dear, dear friend.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.827
- That is a load of crap, Janet.
- I love that dog!

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:11.918
Nobody loves that dog
the way Ned loves that dog.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:16.803
Nobody loves anything
as unconditionally as Ned loves.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.097
[93593]

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:22.975
He's in jail, Janet.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.680
- [Janet] Oh, my God.
- He needs our help.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:26.311
That was fast.
What did he do this time?

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:30.441
He didn't do shit.
We put him there, all of us.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.021
Including you, Janet.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:35.028
I am not gonna stand here
and be insulted on my own porch.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.987
- I'll insult you right here.
- I'm a pacifist. I don't play that way.

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:41.652
I'm gonna peace you in the side of
the head if you don't give us the dog.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:44.493
I'm not gonna receive that
with anything but love.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.748
We are not leaving.

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:53.130
OK, I love that tactic.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:57.176
Billy, get me the phone.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:03.178
Jenny, where's the dog bowl
that he loves so much?

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.593
- Billy, what are you doing?
- Let's go. Come on.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:09.138
- What are you doing?
- Hey, it's his dog, man.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:13.185
Billy, put the dog in the house.
Put the dog in the house, Billy!

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.978
Ilene, you can't take this dog!
This is his home!

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.898
Go back to your fruits
and vegetables, honey.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.907
William! Billy!

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.569
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the dog!

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:27.457
- Hey, easy language, man.
- [dog barking]

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:30.288
- Tell Ned we said, "Hey."
- [Miranda] Thanks, Billy.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:36.920
[dog barking]

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.258
Willie! Willie!

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.469
Oh, thank God, Willie Nelson!

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:46.599
Yeah, buddy! Willie!

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.602
- [barking]
- Yeah! Hey, buddy!

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.685
# When you're hot and you're
cold, not always easy to hold

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.100
# And you're hard to impress

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:56.519
# Sounds funny
But you might be the best

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.777
Want some?

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:01.531
- # Thing that I have
- Not the whole thing! [laughs]

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:04.785
I 'Cause whenever you've gone
and I'm left all alone

01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.366
# Well, the world
seems worse

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:10.499
# No, I didn't really
like you at first

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.955
# I was wrong about that

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:17.126
# So wherever I go

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.667
# I'm taking you with me

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:23.550
# Wherever I go

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:27.262
# You're coming along

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:31.429
Hey, Jeremy. Uh, is it...

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.223
...crazy to think we...

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:39.945
# That's where you belong

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:43.074
I know you're not
gonna call me back, but, um...

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:46.239
One more thing...

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:49.497
Remember the time
I missed your awards dinner?

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:53.625
Well, I wasn't really working.

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:57.163
I was at home watching
Kourtney and Kim Take New York.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.423
I'm sorry. Um... what else?

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.505
# So wherever I go

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.797
# I'm taking you with me

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.887
# Wherever I go

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:12.303
# You're coming along

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:15.313
# You're in my hear? #

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:17.349
- Ah!
- Oh!

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.860
Jeremy and I were talking,

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.442
he has a friend who's also
going through a divorce.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.199
And he works in Poverty at the UN.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.364
He's really nice and really funny.

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:31.200
He does pottery at the UN?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:35.960
I mean, if he's a friend of Jeremy's,
then I guess I could give it a go.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.586
- Right?
- What's his name?

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.048
[Miranda] Roger... Maybe Roger.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.550
What?

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.883
Um... That was Cindy.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:49.764
She wants to come with me tomorrow
to the OB/GYN.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.800
[all] Oh!

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.469
We're getting Cindy.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.387
- [laughter]
- That's great, Nat.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.852
Maybe going all "Honest Ned"
on her worked.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.563
- You don't have to thank me. it's OK.
- Thank you, Ned.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.400
- [laughter]
- You're gonna be the best uncle.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.906
- That's sweet.
- Aw, he is the best uncle.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:09.534
I can't wait. You better come visit me.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.744
- Come visit where?
- What do you mean?

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.080
I've been wanting to tell you guys.
I think it's time for me to move on.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.383
- No.
- Move on? Move on where?

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:27.423
No. I mean...

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.760
You know we just love having you
in our house. Don't you know that?

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.675
Oh, I do know that, and I love you too.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:36.687
But the city's no place
for Willie Nelson or for me.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.098
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:42.108
You guys are gonna be great.
My work here is done.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.895
Who's gonna watch sci-fi with Jeremy?
I can't always do it.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.565
- Who's gonna babysit my kid for free?
- Yeah, who?

01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:49.733
- [music plays]
- [laughter]

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:59.205
[Ned] They're brand new,
I just made them yesterday.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.871
So you're getting some really
fresh candles. All right.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.631
Have a great Shabbos with those.
Thanks a lot.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.963
Anyway, what I was saying though,
is people recycle cans,

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:14.474
they recycle papers, why not candles?

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.977
I say we put a bin out and let people
bring back their old drippings

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:20.014
- at their convenience.
- it's like those bags that say

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.853
"l used to be a plastic bottle."

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:24.901
We could have a bin that said:
"l used to be another candle."

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.779
That's a great idea.
And when they bring in those candles,

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:30.737
we'll put them in another bin that says:
"l used to be another another candle."

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.867
Yeah, eventually we could
just have one that said:

01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.778
"Trust me,
I used to be a lot of candles."

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.117
"I've been a lot of candles."

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.248
"Trust me, man,
I've been other candles."

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.579
[laughs]

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.835
Hey, can I get your
honest opinion on something?

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:43.166
- Sure.
- OK.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:45.164
- Be honest with me.
- Of course.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.171
Do you think this is an ugly candle?

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:51.678
No way, man. There's no such thing
as an ugly homemade candle.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.180
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:55.011
- Good.
- You know what?

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:58.393
We should send, like, just a bunch
of candles to Janet as a thank you.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:02.557
Totally. To thank her
for introducing us and everything?

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.938
Isn't it funny how life works?

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.900
I love it. Just a couple of guys
and a dog, making candles.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.068
What a cliché.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.785
Hey, Willie.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.367
Willie Nelson.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:23.335
Hey, man, have you seen Willie Nelson?

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.370
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
- When?

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:29.212
Oh, you mean recently? No. I just meant
in general, I have seen him.

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.420
Willie Nelson?

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:35.714
Willie?

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.263
Willie Nelson!

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:42.680
Willie?

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.225
Willie Nelson!

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.107
Willie Nelson!

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:51.571
Willie Nelson!

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:53.565
[barking]

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:56.155
Oh, God! Willie Nelson.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:58.912
Oh, buddy. Willie.

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:01.244
Hi, hi.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.369
- Hi, guys. You scared me to death.
- [woman] Dolly?

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:07.412
- Oh, yeah.
- Dolly?

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.457
Deny!

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.588
Hey, come here.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.298
What are you doing?

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:17.180
Hi. Where did you go?

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:20.092
- He ran off, scared me to death.
- So did she.

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:21.931
- Sorry about that?
- Why do you do that, guys?

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:25.348
[laughs] I panicked, man. Oh, my God,
I was running all through town

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.562
- yelling, like...
- I was in the woods. [laughs]

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:30.694
- I had no idea where she had gone.
- She's a cutie, my God.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.901
Thank you.
Yes, isn't that right, Dolly Parton?

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:39.111
- Gorgeous girl.
- Your dog's name is Dolly Parton?

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:44.576
Yeah, I know, stupid, but...
I love Dolly Parton, so...

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.410
What's his name?

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.129
Willie Nelson.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.291
Really?

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.797
[# Carole King: "Beautiful"]

- I'm sorry.
- it's so weird.

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.627
It doesn't even look like you.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.668
- I see no resemblance.
- [laughing]

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:34.800
[laughing] I hope not.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:38.178
[squeaking]

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:43.801
How many times did you criticize him
for having bad breath?

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.102
Or for shedding?

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.894
Or for farts? [laughs]

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:51.603
Shit.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.480
[laughs] OK, get out.
How does that feel?

Which one... Which one's the door?

You know what?
I'll try them all, never mind.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.037
Someone just wet his balls.

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:11.749

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.320
[sighs]

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.660
Oh, that was so much fun, Ned.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.920
- He's right, you should.

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:03.759
What's the funniest thing
you've ever seen?

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:05.424
Stuff.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:08.218
Probably like Anchorman
or something, right?

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.479
- I haven't seen Anchorman.
