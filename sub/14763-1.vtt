00:02.268 --> 00:03.836
[kids laughing]

00:03.838 --> 00:05.537
[chattering]

00:05.539 --> 00:07.606
This way.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.042
[chattering continues]

00:11.277 --> 00:13.012
Mjolnir to me!

00:13.014 --> 00:14.646
Hulk smash!

00:14.648 --> 00:16.482
What are you guys doing,
running away?

00:16.484 --> 00:19.118
You're scared?
Hulk not scared of anything.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.353
Rah!

00:21.355 --> 00:23.722
Rah!
Hulk, look out
behind you!

00:23.724 --> 00:26.058
[imitating gunfire]

00:27.227 --> 00:28.894
Hey, Avengers...

00:30.497 --> 00:32.564
assemble!

00:32.566 --> 00:36.201
Don't tell Hulk what to do.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.504
[grunts]
[crash]

00:38.506 --> 00:42.541
[grunting]

00:42.543 --> 00:45.577
Whoa!
[grunts]

00:45.579 --> 00:46.912
[car alarm blaring]

00:50.083 --> 00:53.152
[grunting]

00:53.154 --> 00:55.354
That all you got, Goliath?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.322
[glass shattering]
[alarm blaring]

00:57.324 --> 00:59.224
Is that Captain America?

00:59.226 --> 01:01.427
So what?
He's only one guy.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.896
He's no match
for the Masters of Evil.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.697
Interesting choice of name.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.866
How does one become
a Master of Evil?

01:07.868 --> 01:10.636
Lots of practice.
[screaming]

01:11.738 --> 01:15.307
[grunting]

01:19.612 --> 01:22.948
We're gonna take out
Captain America.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.452
We'll be rich and famous.
[screaming]

01:26.454 --> 01:28.353
[grunting]

01:31.558 --> 01:33.692
You must be the chatty one.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.928
[grunts]

01:35.930 --> 01:39.398
Aw. All alone, Cap?
You used to run in a group.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.301
What's the name
of that team again?
[groans]

01:42.303 --> 01:44.269
[grunts]
[screaming]

01:44.271 --> 01:45.437
[grunting]

01:45.439 --> 01:49.007
You know exactly who they were.
Avengers!

01:53.480 --> 01:56.448
Assemble.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.465 --> 02:15.300
[growls]
I can't believe
you called us for this.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.002
Nice to see you too,
Iron Man.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.672
I didn't say it wasn't
nice to see you.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.975
I just can't believe
you called us for this.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.410
[screaming]

02:25.412 --> 02:27.513
Stop screaming, Mimi.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.781
[coughing]

02:29.783 --> 02:31.350
Nice shot, Hawkeye.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.452
Yeah, I know.
[grunts]

02:33.454 --> 02:36.321
[coughing]

02:36.323 --> 02:39.324
Gonna knock you out of the sky.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.527
Uh-oh. Whoa!

02:41.529 --> 02:43.362
[grunting]

02:43.364 --> 02:45.931
Falcon,
you might wanna duck.
Yeah.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.470
[car alarm blaring]
[grunts]

02:51.472 --> 02:53.305
Black Widow
just took out Beetle.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.542
Then step back and watch Thor
take out the rest.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.612
[screams]

03:00.614 --> 03:03.315
[growls]
Aahh!

03:03.317 --> 03:05.651
[growling]
[chattering]

03:05.653 --> 03:08.453
Puny tall man!
Hulk smash!

03:08.455 --> 03:11.490
[grunting]

03:11.492 --> 03:13.458
Hulk, I think
he's had enough.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.565
But I ain't done punching!
So who wants to be next?

03:24.804 --> 03:27.039
[blows]

03:27.041 --> 03:30.409
It's been several weeks
since we've met
at the tower like this.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.412
Oh-ho-ho. You missed
hanging out with me.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.013
It's okay.
You can admit it.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.915
We haven't
had reason to meet.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.585
We beat Red Skull,
Thanos, Ultron.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.486
What big threats are left?

03:41.488 --> 03:43.021
That's why Ant-Man
went solo again.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.657
That's why we canceled
our Avengers
expansion plans.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.559
I still think we should
be meeting more often.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.496
But why?
Each of us are heroes
with our own jobs,

03:51.498 --> 03:53.699
our own lives,
our own problems to deal with.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.768
No joke.
Smashing can be
a full-time job.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.038
Point is,
since there's nothing
threatening the world right now,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.007
I'm gonna adjourn the...

04:02.009 --> 04:05.410
Friday, do we have a gavel?
<i>[female voice]</i>
<i>You do now.</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:07.846
This is Friday.
She's the new A.I.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.616
Friday, everybody.
Everybody, Friday.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.852
Then until next time,
whenever that is,

04:13.854 --> 04:16.588
gavel me.
[clacks]

04:18.757 --> 04:21.959
Gentlemen, a word.
Uh-oh.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.030
Widow's got
that "something bad's
about to go down" look.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.433
The Masters of Evil may be tied
into my current top-secret op.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.601
I could use your help.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.604
Ooh. "Top-secret op."
Sounds exciting.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.474
You want in?
No. I've got my own
top-secret thing.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.776
You go have fun.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.544
[Falcon]
What do you got, Widow?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.880
For the past month,
I've been investigating AIM.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.750
Advanced Idea Mechanics.
Secret organization.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.618
Top evil scientists
in the world.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.921
AIM has been stealing
high-tech gear
from all over the world,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.391
then hoarding it
in a hidden underground base.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.625
You have
an infiltration plan?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.161
We're gonna walk in
the front door.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.634
Hmm?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.836
[footsteps approaching]
Huh?

05:11.778 --> 05:13.011
[thud]

05:15.782 --> 05:17.983
[whirring]

05:26.993 --> 05:28.527
[Black Widow]
Now!
Huh?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.562
What's going on?
[grunting]

05:33.833 --> 05:36.868
She wasn't talking to you.
She was talking to us.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.637
Sorry about the confusion.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.639
"Sorry about the confusion"?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.708
They're AIM agents.
You don't have to
be nice to them.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.843
They're letting us
borrow their uniforms.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.812
Least we could do
is be polite.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.046
[sighs]

06:03.830 --> 06:06.898
[Black Widow]
AIM's stash of stolen tech.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.836
[Falcon] There's no rhyme
or reason to any of this.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.105
I don't get it.
[Captain America]
We're not alone.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.875
Try to play it cool.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.781
Or not!

06:27.920 --> 06:29.588
[grunting]

06:31.858 --> 06:34.059
[grunting]

06:34.061 --> 06:36.194
Hawkeye?
Are you kidding me?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.196
[grunts]

06:38.198 --> 06:39.865
Ohh! Ow!

06:39.867 --> 06:42.501
Natasha?
[grunting]

06:42.503 --> 06:43.969
[grunts]

06:45.104 --> 06:46.571
Captain?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.542
How'd you know it was me?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.110
That's my roundhouse kick,

06:52.112 --> 06:54.513
and the only person
I taught it to was you.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.882
[Thor]
Ha! Avengers assembled.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.918
Even if we didn't
plan to assemble.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.987
[Falcon]
But what about that guy?

07:02.855 --> 07:04.723
Wait! Falcon, stop!

07:04.725 --> 07:06.091
No, no.
Don't do that.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.893
That's no AIM agent.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.861
That's Hulk.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.764
Uh, hey, guys.
[Falcon]
Bruce?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.966
Uh, I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you

07:14.968 --> 07:17.903
without the green
and the muscles,
and the angry.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.104
Honest mistake.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.873
Just please try not
to do that again.

07:25.978 --> 07:29.247
I can't believe
you followed me.
I didn't follow you.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.917
For your information,
I'm on my own mission.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.252
To investigate AIM's
new mystery leader.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.988
Calls himself
the "Scientist Supreme."

07:36.990 --> 07:40.492
Natasha asked you two
to come with her and help?

07:40.494 --> 07:42.627
Hmph!
She didn't ask us.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.963
Hawkeye invited us.
Why didn't she?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.965
The three of us have
S.H.I.E.L.D. training.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.734
Widow wanted a team
that would be
inconspicuous undercover.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.974
Hey, I can be inconspicuous...
when I'm not green.

07:55.976 --> 08:00.111
You and I were both
embedded in AIM
and neither of us knew?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.947
We've been spending
too much time apart.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.849
Left hand doesn't know
what the right hand's doing.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.283
<i>[man over PA]</i>
<i>Science soldiers of AIM,</i>

08:05.285 --> 08:07.652
<i>this is your Scientist Supreme.</i>

08:07.654 --> 08:10.989
<i>I will be addressing the troops</i>
<i>in the laboratory</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

08:10.991 --> 08:13.091
<i>Attendance is mandatory.</i>

08:13.093 --> 08:14.993
The Scientist Supreme.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.530
We find him,
we find out why AIM
is stealing super tech.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.165
[Falcon]
Guys, gonna wanna see this.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.001
I've hacked into AIM's
development projects.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.072
There's a list
of tech they've stolen,
including this.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.110
Ultron?
How did they get their hands
on a piece of Ultron?

08:32.111 --> 08:35.614
Stay calm.
We'll get to the bottom
of this, Tony.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.115
Easy for you to say.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.818
You're not the one
responsible for him.
I am.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.219
Come on.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.356
Let's go hear
what the Scientist Supreme
has to say.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.794
[man]
As your Scientist Supreme,

08:49.796 --> 08:51.296
I see all.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.699
I see a new
Advanced Idea Mechanics.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.903
More ambitious, ruthless.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.505
Standing on the precipice
of greatness.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.974
I see AIM and the universe

09:02.976 --> 09:06.211
and our place within
the vast singularity.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.714
[Stark]
That's the leader of AIM?
Doesn't seem dangerous.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.151
Seems more like a--
[Thor] Like a weirdo.

09:13.153 --> 09:17.756
I see the future,
and the future is now.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.326
Behold the Adaptoids.

09:21.328 --> 09:25.330
They didn't just
steal the Adaptoid,
they built three of them.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.899
We have improved
the Adaptoid technology.

09:27.901 --> 09:32.270
Now they can copy any powers
within close proximity.

09:34.106 --> 09:37.709
They are picking up gamma rays.
But from where?

09:37.711 --> 09:41.079
Would it appear we have
guests among us?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.347
Uh-oh.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.082
What?
How could it be?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.618
[Captain America]
Our cover's been blown.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.354
Okay, Avengers.
It's time to, you know.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.223
And the Adaptoids
have adapted.

09:52.225 --> 09:56.394
Indeed.
I see a new future--

09:56.396 --> 09:58.697
one without Avengers.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.866
Adaptoids, attack!

10:06.238 --> 10:08.940
[grunts]
Avengers, move!

10:10.309 --> 10:14.045
[grunts]
Adaptoids don't merely
duplicate our powers,

10:14.047 --> 10:16.881
they copy our strength!

10:16.883 --> 10:18.883
[Bruce]
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.253
AIM's somehow managed
to upgrade both
the complex internal adaptors

10:22.255 --> 10:25.924
and the external
structural integrity
at the same time.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.827
If we get out of this alive,
maybe we can ask them
how they did it.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.431
But look.
They're not preprogrammed.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.301
They're somehow copying
our powers on the fly
in real time.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.337
Bruce, we don't
need you to analyze.
We need you to get mad.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.806
No. No!
The Adaptoids will...

10:41.808 --> 10:43.174
Ow!

10:43.176 --> 10:47.078
That hurts,
and hurt makes me mad!

10:47.080 --> 10:49.314
[roaring]

10:49.316 --> 10:52.017
Oh. That's what Bruce meant.

10:52.019 --> 10:55.687
[grunting]
Oh, gee, that's my thing!

10:55.689 --> 10:57.188
[roaring]

10:57.190 --> 11:00.325
[groans]

11:00.327 --> 11:04.763
With the Avengers here,
I see we need to move up
our schedule. This way.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.503
The Adaptoids copy our powers
in close proximity,
so we need to split up.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.171
Quit talking and go.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.407
[grunts]

11:23.382 --> 11:26.418
Now it only has our powers.
Beating it won't be as...
[grunts]

11:28.454 --> 11:30.388
You were saying?
Maybe I was wrong.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.424
What am I talking about?

11:33.993 --> 11:36.027
I'm never wrong.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.200
[grunts]

11:42.202 --> 11:44.969
[grunts]

11:44.971 --> 11:46.037
[grunts]

11:46.039 --> 11:47.138
Tony!

11:49.375 --> 11:50.408
[grunts]

11:53.345 --> 11:54.713
[grunts]

11:54.715 --> 11:56.815
Sorry, Cap. My bad.
[grunts]

11:59.318 --> 12:00.385
[grunts]

12:02.521 --> 12:04.823
We're out of synch.
Too much time apart.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.524
We'll have to catch up.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.426
Away from here.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.763
[grunting]

12:11.765 --> 12:13.498
[growling]

12:26.011 --> 12:28.747
[grunting]

12:28.749 --> 12:30.348
[groans]

12:30.350 --> 12:31.616
[yells]

12:34.954 --> 12:36.287
Odin's beard!

12:36.289 --> 12:39.524
[grunting]

12:41.927 --> 12:45.530
Your strength and my strength,
and it is still not enough.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.233
Thing is as strong as we are.
[growls]

12:48.235 --> 12:49.934
[grunts]

12:54.073 --> 12:56.141
[Hawkeye]
Hey, dummy.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.214
I used to have teammates.

13:08.954 --> 13:12.357
[yells, grunts]

13:13.592 --> 13:15.794
[grunting]

13:15.796 --> 13:18.763
Copies of Hawkeye's arrows,
my fleshettes
and your stingers?

13:18.765 --> 13:20.965
That thing is nothing more
than an Avengers' knockoff.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.570
Unless we start working
as a team, the knockoffs
are gonna beat the originals.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.743
[grunts]

13:31.745 --> 13:34.879
<i>Tony, give me an atomic drop.</i>
That'll work.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.088
[grunts]

13:44.090 --> 13:47.192
Oh, yeah!
Always liked that move.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.461
<i>[over PA]</i>
<i>This is your leader,</i>
<i>your Scientist Supreme.</i>

13:50.463 --> 13:52.931
<i>Adaptoids, move to phase two.</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:57.368
Phase two?

13:57.370 --> 14:00.171
That can't be good.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.607
[grunting]

14:02.609 --> 14:03.875
Rah!

14:05.978 --> 14:08.179
[laughing]
[laughing]

14:10.316 --> 14:11.583
Hey!

14:12.952 --> 14:14.786
Everyone present
and accounted for?

14:14.788 --> 14:16.855
Everyone except the Adaptoids.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.723
They're here somewhere.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.626
Fan out and look
for any sign of them.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.394
And the Scientist Supreme?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.896
Yeah.
Found him.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.532
Ah, the Avengers.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.968
Phase one testing complete.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.204
Everything is going
according to my plan.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.573
To get crushed
by the Avengers?

14:35.575 --> 14:38.309
Then let's see your plan
all the way to the end.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.145
I am the Scientist Supreme.

14:41.147 --> 14:45.717
I am the future,
and I am your destroyer.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.853
Adaptoids, assemble.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.190
With my genius combined
with the resources of AIM,

14:52.192 --> 14:56.427
we have improved the Adaptoids
into something more--

14:56.429 --> 14:58.396
the Supreme Adaptoid.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.066
Phase two:
destroy the Avengers.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.502
The mind
of the Scientist Supreme,

15:04.504 --> 15:07.038
with the Adaptoid's ability
to copy all our powers.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.573
I don't like what I'm seeing.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.977
Because it looks bad.
Very, very bad.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.782
Its energy ratings
are off the charts.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.790
Avengers, let's get to work.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.793
I think not.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.997
[grunts]

15:34.133 --> 15:35.600
[grunts]

15:35.602 --> 15:37.936
Yah!

15:42.775 --> 15:45.610
If we need a plan,
then I have a plan.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.111
Hulk, wait here.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.947
What do you mean,
"Wait here"?

15:48.949 --> 15:51.983
Give us ten seconds.
Count to ten,

15:51.985 --> 15:54.218
then jump in and smash.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.354
Come, Falcon.
Follow my lead!

16:01.460 --> 16:05.063
One, two...

16:05.065 --> 16:08.433
Doh! Nuts to this!
[roaring]

16:08.435 --> 16:10.668
[groans]

16:10.670 --> 16:12.503
What exactly was your plan?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.639
Math makes Hulk angry.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.744
[groans]

16:19.746 --> 16:22.080
[grunting]

16:29.989 --> 16:31.856
Naive fools.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.093
You face the power
of the Supreme Adaptoid,

16:35.095 --> 16:39.163
augmented by the mind
of the Scientist Supreme.

16:39.165 --> 16:44.635
Observe the likes of which
you've never seen before!

16:44.637 --> 16:47.505
[Avengers grunting]

16:50.042 --> 16:52.410
Our team's still out of synch.

16:55.948 --> 17:00.118
We're getting schooled
by an Adaptoid and AIM?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.786
How is this even happening?

17:04.455 --> 17:06.424
Hmm?

17:10.229 --> 17:13.631
It is not the same Adaptoid
and not the same AIM.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.267
You must not
become overconfident.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.803
[grunts]
[roars]

17:21.473 --> 17:22.640
[groans]

17:22.642 --> 17:24.242
Right at this moment,

17:24.243 --> 17:26.743
I don't think overconfidence
is our problem.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.147
[grunting]

17:29.149 --> 17:31.416
Communicate with each other,
like a team.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.552
Attack plan Delta. Go!

17:35.554 --> 17:37.522
[grunts]

17:37.524 --> 17:39.590
Hulk, take him high!
[growls]

17:40.893 --> 17:43.594
[roaring, grunting]

17:47.900 --> 17:50.234
Thor, take him low!

17:50.236 --> 17:52.370
[yells]

17:52.372 --> 17:54.739
On your left!

17:57.276 --> 17:59.677
The liquid metal.
Scan it for a weakness.

17:59.679 --> 18:03.247
It's some weird space-age tech
that I know nothing about

18:03.249 --> 18:05.283
and have never seen before
in my life.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.884
Give me, like, four minutes.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.920
[grunting]

18:10.289 --> 18:14.358
Hey, remember Tokyo?
Why would you bring that up?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.894
The other thing
that happened in Tokyo.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.931
Oh! Oh, why didn't you
just say so?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.435
[grunts]

18:30.375 --> 18:33.678
Keep it up.
Hit him before
he can recover.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.514
[grunts]

18:39.918 --> 18:42.820
Scan complete.
And what do you know?
A weak spot.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.822
We need to hit him
when he splits off.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.425
I've modified
my concussion rockets.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.928
It'll make the metal unstable
just long enough for you guys
to blast it off of him.

18:50.930 --> 18:56.501
Falcon, you'll have five seconds
to collect it before it returns.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.569
One containment bubble
coming up!

19:05.010 --> 19:06.511
[grunts]

19:10.449 --> 19:12.650
[growls]

19:12.652 --> 19:15.520
No!
Yep.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.590
No!
[grunts]

19:20.826 --> 19:22.593
[grunts]

19:22.595 --> 19:24.428
You may have me,

19:24.430 --> 19:27.865
but not before I take thousands
of innocent lives.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.700
[grunting]
<i>[buzzing]</i>

19:29.702 --> 19:31.969
Sorry about that.
I'm more of a genius,

19:31.971 --> 19:33.971
and I just jammed
your frequency.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.340
You should really think
about upgrading your system.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.009
[yells]

19:39.378 --> 19:42.613
Uh-oh. Our brawl with
the supreme Adaptoid

19:42.615 --> 19:46.484
just compromised
the structural integrity
of the entire AIM base.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.487
If the base collapses,
it'll take
the whole town with it.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.556
Cap, Hawkeye, Widow,

19:51.558 --> 19:54.058
you guys go upstairs
and keep those people safe.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.860
The rest of you, with me.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.734
[thud]
Ugh!

20:03.736 --> 20:06.537
[whimpering]

20:07.906 --> 20:11.409
On the count of three.
One--
Three!

20:11.411 --> 20:13.411
[grunting]

20:13.413 --> 20:16.414
Math still makes me angry.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.583
Falcon, we could use
that Adaptoid metal.

20:18.585 --> 20:22.520
To reinforce the damaged beams?
Way ahead of you.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.755
I've recalibrated the Unibeam.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.366
[straining]

20:35.368 --> 20:37.568
Hulk,
you can let go now.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.003
Oh.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.041
Oh, almost forgot.
[grunts]

20:44.043 --> 20:46.377
That's for zapping me
in the butt with an arrow.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.545
It's cool.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.047
I deserve that.
[groans]

20:50.049 --> 20:54.385
Remember how you said
we should start meeting
on a regular basis again?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.721
I'm starting to think
maybe you're right.

20:56.723 --> 21:00.791
It's a big world out there,
and there's always
another threat.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.629
Let them come.
The Avengers will be ready.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.867
Huh? No!

21:09.869 --> 21:12.436
[crying out]
[Ultron]
Will you quit your complaining,

21:12.438 --> 21:14.805
so-called Scientist Supreme?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.907
[crying out stops]
That's better.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.778
Your intelligence
and Adaptoid body
belong to me.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.448
No. It's impossible.

21:24.450 --> 21:29.654
The Ultron revolution
begins now.
