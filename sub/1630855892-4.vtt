-I feel really nervous around him.
-[Nora] I said stop doing that.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.843
I knew when Dennis died,
it was gonna be hard,

00:09.927 --> 00:12.054
but I thought he was gonna be sad,
not reckless.

-Like, study?

-Yes.

to help you cheat?

00:28.403 --> 00:29.947
Nora, what're you doin' here?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
He's come back to make us pay
for what we did to him.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.700

-Ew.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.019

Um, it's called the "Booms of Doom."

Oh, your body just gets
relaxed and your brain--

02:47.501 --> 02:49.336
I can't afford to be relaxed.

It's kinda my thing, I just relax people.

[sighs] Yeah, well.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.934
Well, we do.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.770
Because we're two grown adults
having an affair.

But also... wrong.

is gonna change the way I feel about you.

I was worried.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.677
Nowhere.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.771
Did you send Eliza an apology for what
happened at her house the other night?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.523
You know, most people start with,
"Good morning."

07:21.775 --> 07:23.109
Good morning.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.111
Did you send Eliza an apology note?

07:25.195 --> 07:27.781
No. Because there was nothing
to apologize for.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.032
What does that mean?

07:32.661 --> 07:34.663
Fine. Just sit there and silently sulk.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.304
He's literally the most normal,
honest person in the world.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.888
There's no way he's connected
to any of this.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.932
She's got a point.
I've lived next door for years,

13:28.016 --> 13:29.851
and her dad's, like, the OG of norm-core.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.520
You said he did puzzles before COVID?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.314
His aura is beige.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.357
Gotta love him.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.110
-[Isabella sighs]
-[James exhales] OK. What the hell.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.571
Literally, after the week we've had,
what else can go wrong?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.406
-James!
-No.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.324
It's like you want us to die.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.493
-What?
-[sighs]

13:48.411 --> 13:51.998
-[bell rings]
-[James and Isaiah sigh]

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
Uh, Stokes?

14:05.595 --> 14:08.890
Can I, um, can I talk to you
about something?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.141
Yeah, um...

14:10.224 --> 14:11.684
Is this about what happened at the docks?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.437
-'Cause I've been meaning to explain--
-No, I mean, that was, like, really weird,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.023
but it's different.
Um, there's just, um...

14:18.733 --> 14:20.234
Well, there's something in my bedroom

14:20.318 --> 14:21.694
and I need to show it to you.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.905
It's not like a weird thing,

14:23.988 --> 14:27.825
it just happens to be
in my bedroom and w...

14:27.909 --> 14:30.411
I'm not gonna, like,
murder you or anything.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.497
You really need to workshop
your pick-up lines.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.248
[Margot chuckles]

14:34.332 --> 14:35.708
Wasn't trying to pick you up.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.418
No, I know, I was...

14:37.502 --> 14:39.754
Sorry, uh, it's just really important.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.966
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Cool.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.639
All right, my mom and I didn't
exactly have a great morning,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.558
so I just wanna make sure
she's kinda gone...

14:54.977 --> 14:57.980
OK. After you.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.818
Um, I just didn't want her to, like,

15:01.901 --> 15:04.487
you know, offer us snacks and be,
like, weird or something like that.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.614
Ah, yes, avoiding a hovering parent.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.407
-I know it well.
-[Lucas] Mm.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.076
[door squeaking]

15:18.501 --> 15:20.336
This is a nice room.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.505
Like, not so...

15:22.588 --> 15:25.424
musky as you would expect
a boy's room to be. [chuckles]

15:25.508 --> 15:27.260
Yeah, you know.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.138
Contrary to popular belief,
I believe in good hygiene.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.391
Don't take this the wrong way,
but that's kinda surprising for you.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.852
Yeah...

15:35.935 --> 15:37.603
That was a joke, I...

15:37.687 --> 15:43.526
Yeah. Um, you should probably, um, sit,

15:43.609 --> 15:45.862
um, sit down for this.

15:48.406 --> 15:53.828
It's, um, super weird and, uh, sort of...

15:54.787 --> 15:58.541
You know, uh, tough to watch,

15:58.624 --> 15:59.917
but, um...

16:01.335 --> 16:03.629
Yeah, I'm just gonna, um, show you.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.551
What?

16:13.848 --> 16:18.186
Um, that's my dad. And your...

16:18.978 --> 16:20.229
Yeah, it's my mom.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.612
It's from this morning when, um...

16:28.362 --> 16:32.617
When, um, he dropped her off.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.995
I can't believe
he would do this to my mom.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.247
I'm really sorry.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.583
Uh...

16:44.253 --> 16:47.506
[sniffles] Uh, do they know that you know?

16:47.590 --> 16:49.342
No. No, no...

16:49.425 --> 16:50.509
My mom, um...

16:51.844 --> 16:53.679
I tried to talk to her
about it this morning,

16:53.763 --> 16:57.767
but, um, she denied what she did

16:57.850 --> 17:01.187
and just kind of lied to my face, I guess.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.814
Yeah, my dad...

17:04.649 --> 17:06.234
I just thought he left
before me this morning,

17:06.317 --> 17:07.735
but I guess he never came home.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.655
I'm really sorry you had to,

17:10.738 --> 17:13.115
you know, find out like this,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.952
um, like, that I had
to be the one to tell you,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
I just, you know, figured you should know.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.501
If it makes you feel any better, you know,

17:24.752 --> 17:26.337
my dad's dead.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.926
It doesn't, but thanks for trying.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.056
[sighs] Hey.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.101
I have something
that's gonna cheer you up.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.562
If it is a video
of our parents having sex,

17:43.646 --> 17:45.231
then I'm-- I'm leaving.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.315
No, it's, uh...

17:47.191 --> 17:48.442
It's these.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.570
-It's my friends.
-Your friends?

17:50.653 --> 17:53.864
Yeah, do you, uh, remember the worms?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.616
From the Halloween party?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.703
-[Margot] Ah. Those friends.
-Yeah.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.418
This... is him.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.961
It's a worm.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.713
I know, pretty cool, right?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.214
'Kay.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.800
You wanna see me eat it?

18:13.551 --> 18:16.637
No, thank you. I--
I appreciate the attempt to cheer me up

18:16.721 --> 18:17.805
but that's not gonna...

18:17.888 --> 18:20.391
-[Lucas gagging]
-Oh, my God!

18:20.474 --> 18:22.059
Oh, my God, what did you just do?

18:22.143 --> 18:24.395
-[Lucas gagging]
-Are you OK?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.856
-Oh... Are...
-[Lucas gags]

18:26.939 --> 18:28.441
Oh. Mm.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.900
-[Lucas exhales]
-Oh.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.028
I'm good. I'm good. I think he's...

18:32.111 --> 18:33.738
[clears throat] I think I got it.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.323
Yeah, I'm good. I'm chilling.
It's all good.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.325
-I'm OK.
-You're chilling?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.410
Do you even know
what kind of worms those were?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.162
What if it's a parasite or something?

18:41.245 --> 18:45.082
-Do you need me to, I...
-Uh. Well, it's all protein now.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.959
[chuckles]

18:49.295 --> 18:51.255
OK. Um...

18:52.757 --> 18:54.175
On that note, I should go.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.593
Uh, I could walk you home.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.095
-If you wanted.
-Uh, yeah, sure.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.389
Hey, Margot!

19:01.390 --> 19:03.517
You're bringing him
to this thing with your dad?

19:05.353 --> 19:06.354
What thing?

19:06.437 --> 19:07.813
No... Change of plans.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.315
We're not telling my dad anything anymore.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.608
Why, what's going on?

19:10.691 --> 19:12.735
What's going on is just...

19:12.818 --> 19:14.654
I can't trust my dad. That's all.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.990
Hey! Lucas. And Isaiah.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.326
-Hey.
-I don't know what you guys are up to,

19:20.409 --> 19:23.079
but I just started an 8,000 piece puzzle

19:23.162 --> 19:24.455
of the Milky Way Galaxy

19:24.538 --> 19:25.956
if anybody wants to help out.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.501
-Uh...
-I'll talk to you guys later.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.586
-OK.
-[Lucas] Later.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.047
I didn't know you're friends
with Lucas Parker.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.507
That's great. That's fun.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.092
-[Colin clears throat]
-Yeah, sure.

19:36.842 --> 19:41.013
[stomach gurgling]

19:45.267 --> 19:47.019
-Are you good?
-Uh...

19:48.062 --> 19:50.314
Ye-- Yeah. Um, I'm good.

19:51.148 --> 19:55.152
Oh... Yeah, I gotta do it
at my house, too.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.666
[ominous music]

20:09.458 --> 20:11.419
[worms squelching]

20:41.282 --> 20:43.284
[ominous music intensifies]

20:58.090 --> 21:01.427
[seagulls cawing]

21:01.510 --> 21:03.929
[Lucas groans]

21:14.327 --> 21:15.328
[Lucas sniffles]

21:19.082 --> 21:21.000
[Nora] Lucas, breakfast!

21:22.460 --> 21:23.961
[yawns]

21:28.174 --> 21:29.592
OK.

21:30.551 --> 21:32.720
OK, uh, burrito. It's on the counter.

21:32.804 --> 21:33.805
Thanks.

21:33.888 --> 21:36.599
[cheerful song playing on radio]

21:36.682 --> 21:38.684
[bell rings]

21:44.190 --> 21:46.359
[Lucas chewing]

21:46.442 --> 21:49.445
[ominous music]

22:09.340 --> 22:12.176
[ominous music]

22:34.824 --> 22:37.118
[bell rings]

22:37.201 --> 22:38.703
[students laughing]

22:38.786 --> 22:40.163
-Come on.
-Oh, man!

22:40.872 --> 22:43.958
[students laugh, grunt]

22:47.003 --> 22:48.880
Dude! You OK?

22:50.214 --> 22:52.216
Uh... Yeah. [chuckles]

22:52.300 --> 22:53.301
Yeah, man, I'm OK!

22:53.384 --> 22:57.096
Really? We totally nailed you.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.181
I didn't feel it.

22:58.264 --> 23:01.017
[students laughing]

23:36.511 --> 23:39.513
[bones cracking]

23:45.269 --> 23:47.021
I'm gonna go throw up now.

23:47.104 --> 23:49.106
[student moans]

23:49.190 --> 23:51.150
No, you don't understand.
I don't feel anything.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.533
[Margot] Hey, Lucas?

24:00.034 --> 24:01.035
-[door slams]
-Hey!

24:01.118 --> 24:04.914
Hi. Um, I was just checking in,

24:04.997 --> 24:08.584
'cause I know
yesterday was really... sucky,

24:08.668 --> 24:11.254
and I wanted to see
how you're handling it.

24:11.337 --> 24:13.256
Yeah, I'm so good.

24:13.339 --> 24:14.924
You know, I'm just, uh,

24:15.007 --> 24:16.884
just rolling with the punches
and, you know, uh,

24:16.968 --> 24:19.345
doing all the things that need to be done.

24:19.428 --> 24:20.888
So, you're fine?

24:20.972 --> 24:24.225
-[chuckles] Margs. Listen...
-Don't call me Margs.

24:24.308 --> 24:26.060
[Lucas scoffs]

24:26.143 --> 24:27.812
[sighs] I know you're in pain.

24:27.895 --> 24:30.314
But the great thing about pain,

24:30.398 --> 24:33.442
is that you can actually
choose not to feel it.

24:33.526 --> 24:36.529
I really don't think that's how it works.

24:37.655 --> 24:39.240
Well, what I'm learning today,

24:39.991 --> 24:41.909
is that's exactly how it works.

24:52.378 --> 24:55.214
Well, she saw something in the forest
the night of the party.

24:55.298 --> 24:56.299
It could be connected.

24:56.382 --> 24:58.634
OK, but she sucks. She's rude.

24:58.718 --> 25:01.345
-No offense.
-Hm? What are we talking about?

25:01.429 --> 25:02.972
Isaiah would like to bring Allison

25:03.055 --> 25:04.515
into the Haunted Housewives
of Port Lawrence.

25:04.599 --> 25:06.892
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, no, bad idea.

25:06.976 --> 25:09.312
[sighs] I knew you was gonna say that.

25:09.395 --> 25:10.646
What is your problem with her?

25:10.730 --> 25:13.983
It's not... It's not that I have
a problem, it's just...

25:14.066 --> 25:16.193
You want to bring
someone else into this mess?

25:16.277 --> 25:18.112
[chuckles] Wait. What is the dynamic here?

25:18.195 --> 25:19.530
-Did you guys date?
-No!

25:19.613 --> 25:21.365
[together] No, we're neighbors.

25:21.449 --> 25:23.951
-Who dated?
-It's like they're an old divorced couple.

25:24.035 --> 25:26.746
But now that they're retired,
the kids are off in college,

25:26.829 --> 25:29.498
they're finally entering the more
amicable part of their separation.

25:29.582 --> 25:31.167
-I will hurt you.
-No, it's not.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.668
We should probably talk about it,

25:32.752 --> 25:35.129
-'cause I'm feeling the vibes.
-Feeling what vibes?

25:36.922 --> 25:38.507
Why did you ask me to come here?

25:38.591 --> 25:40.926
We all just wanted to talk to you
about what happened.

25:41.010 --> 25:42.637
No, we didn't.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.472
What do you mean, "what happened?"

25:45.473 --> 25:46.932
In the forest.

25:47.016 --> 25:48.267
Ring a bell?

25:48.351 --> 25:50.603
'Kay, nothing happened in the forest.

25:50.686 --> 25:51.937
Please don't tell her.

25:52.021 --> 25:54.231
OK, how about you don't tell my boyfriend

25:54.315 --> 25:56.651
what he should and shouldn't tell me?

25:58.527 --> 25:59.528
Mm-hmm.

26:03.407 --> 26:04.408
Smooth.

26:04.492 --> 26:06.494
-[Margot sighs]
-Thanks, guys.

26:07.620 --> 26:09.246
Told you she sucked.

26:09.330 --> 26:12.917
Hey, Allison! Come on, baby, hold up.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.419
[Allison] Just tell me what's going on.

26:15.503 --> 26:16.962
That's what I've been trying to do.

26:17.046 --> 26:20.049
Not your stupid ghost story.
I'm talking about Margot.

26:20.132 --> 26:22.968
You two have this secret thing
and I'm just not in on it.

26:23.052 --> 26:24.720
OK, fine. You want to know our secret?

26:25.388 --> 26:28.182
Look, she helped me cheat on my test,

26:28.265 --> 26:30.601
so then I got a good enough
grade to play in the game.

26:31.727 --> 26:33.062
That's it.

26:33.145 --> 26:34.605
That's the big secret, OK?

26:34.689 --> 26:35.940
You happy?

26:36.691 --> 26:38.526
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

26:38.609 --> 26:41.612
That the girl I've always suspected
you've always had feelings for,

26:41.695 --> 26:44.657
-helped you cheat on a test?
-No, no, it's not--

26:44.740 --> 26:47.076
God, you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

26:47.827 --> 26:48.869
I...

26:50.454 --> 26:53.040
Well, yeah, that's why I had
to cheat on the test.

26:54.667 --> 26:55.918
[sighs]

27:01.507 --> 27:02.508
What's up, dude?

27:03.384 --> 27:04.385
Wassup?

27:10.141 --> 27:11.725
[knocking]

27:11.809 --> 27:12.810
Come in.

27:15.896 --> 27:18.149
I need to talk to you about something.

27:18.232 --> 27:21.068
Hey, yo, you guys seen Lucas?

27:21.152 --> 27:22.820
Uh, yeah. Earlier today.

27:22.903 --> 27:25.322
I guess he's not really one of the guys
I keep track of, you know.

27:25.406 --> 27:26.949
He's been acting super weird.

27:27.032 --> 27:28.617
He was walking his dirtbike
through the hallway.

27:28.701 --> 27:31.036
-He's just going through a lot right now.
-[Isaiah] Yeah, seems like it.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.248
You know, last night,
after you went inside, he got pretty sick.

27:34.331 --> 27:37.418
There was a whole gross stomach situation.

27:37.501 --> 27:40.337
-Stomach situation?
-I thought the meeting was canceled.

27:40.421 --> 27:41.422
Yeah, no it was.

27:41.505 --> 27:44.175
Um, Lucas was just walking me home.

27:44.258 --> 27:46.218
It's a long story. He ate a worm.

27:46.302 --> 27:48.220
So he finally ate the worm?

27:48.304 --> 27:50.514
He was trying to flex
at the Halloween party and do it there.

27:51.599 --> 27:52.600
Right.

27:53.726 --> 27:55.561
He found the worms at the Biddle house.

27:56.896 --> 27:59.315
Camera, mask, dupes...

28:00.649 --> 28:01.817
[all] Worms.

28:01.901 --> 28:05.446
-Oh, this is bad.
-[ominous music]

28:05.529 --> 28:06.530
Margot.

28:09.617 --> 28:11.035
OK, one sec, guys.

28:14.663 --> 28:15.998
What's up, Dad?

28:16.081 --> 28:17.291
Uh, close the door, please.

28:21.587 --> 28:23.255
So, look, I know.

28:24.548 --> 28:25.549
You know?

28:26.467 --> 28:27.718
I know about everything.

28:31.138 --> 28:33.724
-Wait, who told you?
-Honey, that's not important.

28:33.807 --> 28:36.101
What's important is that

28:36.185 --> 28:38.270
I'm the guidance counselor at this school,

28:38.354 --> 28:40.940
and my own daughter's
been accused of cheating.

28:42.608 --> 28:45.444
Wait. Wait, what?

28:45.528 --> 28:47.988
Just tell me, honey, honestly.

28:48.072 --> 28:51.158
Did you share your answers
with Isaiah on the test?

28:51.242 --> 28:53.244
Did he pressure you?
'Cause this is so out of character.

28:53.327 --> 28:56.372
No, no, I... [scoffs]

28:57.331 --> 28:58.916
OK, I-- I can't...

28:58.999 --> 29:01.043
I can't believe this is happening, no.

29:01.126 --> 29:04.213
OK, so you're not denying it, then.

29:04.296 --> 29:06.006
Look, Margot.

29:06.090 --> 29:07.508
I'm asking you.

29:07.591 --> 29:10.594
Yes or no, did you cheat?

29:13.514 --> 29:14.640
Yeah, I did…

29:16.225 --> 29:17.977
and I guess I learned that from my Dad.

29:20.563 --> 29:22.064
Look, I know about you and Nora.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.069
What, I don't...

29:27.736 --> 29:29.321
Were you just not gonna tell me?

29:29.405 --> 29:30.406
Or Mom?

29:32.533 --> 29:33.701
Honey...

29:35.661 --> 29:38.747
-It's not that simple, um--
-No, I think it's very simple.

29:38.831 --> 29:42.042
You are sleeping with someone
that is not my mom.

29:44.003 --> 29:46.839
[students] Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

29:46.922 --> 29:49.091

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

29:59.351 --> 30:01.270
-[students chanting]
-Well, this has to be Biddle.

30:01.353 --> 30:02.396
I don't know, man.

30:02.479 --> 30:03.772
Lucas is always doing something crazy.

30:05.357 --> 30:07.318
-[Margot] Lucas!
-Lucas!

30:07.401 --> 30:08.485
Lucas! What are you doing?

30:08.569 --> 30:11.322
Get off the roof of the school right now!

30:11.405 --> 30:14.241
Lucas, listen to me!
You're gonna get hurt!

30:14.325 --> 30:16.660
Come down off the roof of the building!

30:16.744 --> 30:18.329
[Margot] Lucas, stop!

30:18.412 --> 30:20.331
-No, no, no!
-Are you out of your mind?

30:20.414 --> 30:23.208
[all exclaim]

30:25.711 --> 30:28.380
-[car alarms beeping]
-No! My car!

30:34.386 --> 30:36.555
Are you out of your stupid mind?

30:36.639 --> 30:38.223
Are you OK? You could've been killed!

30:38.307 --> 30:40.476
Look at me. Look at me, Lucas!

30:41.477 --> 30:43.479
I probably can't even drive that now.

30:44.396 --> 30:47.399
I'm gonna have to recommend
that the Principal expel you.

30:49.234 --> 30:51.862
And I'm gonna recommend
you stop banging my mom.

30:58.285 --> 31:01.288
Lucas! Lucas.

31:01.372 --> 31:02.873
Lucas, stop.

31:02.956 --> 31:04.208
What was that? You--

31:06.502 --> 31:09.171
Dude, you really messed up your shoulder.
You need to go to the hospital.

31:09.254 --> 31:11.882
No, I didn't. Just...

31:11.965 --> 31:12.800
[Lucas grunts]

31:15.427 --> 31:16.470
See?

31:18.097 --> 31:20.140
-What--
-I'm invincible.

31:22.476 --> 31:24.019
Wait, Lucas, what's under your skin?

31:24.103 --> 31:27.439
Ah, I would love to stay and chat,

31:27.523 --> 31:32.027
but I have a Denn-defying date
with the "Booms of Doom."

31:33.320 --> 31:34.697
Later.

31:47.626 --> 31:49.628
Yo, boy. Here we go.

31:49.712 --> 31:51.588
Nora, we have to talk.

31:51.672 --> 31:54.717
Yes, your father called
and told me everything.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.135
I'm so sorry. You must be--

31:56.218 --> 31:58.929
No. This is not about your stupid affair.
This is about Lucas.

31:59.722 --> 32:01.390
I think Biddle got to him.

32:01.473 --> 32:03.517
-There are these worms, and--
-Worms?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.436
Yeah. He found them
at the Halloween party.

32:05.519 --> 32:06.895
And he ate one last night.

32:06.979 --> 32:09.732
And I think they're, like,
crawling around inside of him.

32:09.815 --> 32:12.276
I don't really know,
but he's acting really strange and...

32:12.359 --> 32:14.528
I'm really worried about him.

32:14.611 --> 32:15.863
Uh, before he left he said,

32:15.946 --> 32:17.531
something about the "Booms of Doom"

32:17.614 --> 32:20.576
-and then he took off.
-Let's go. Let's go. Right now.

32:20.659 --> 32:23.912
-[bell rings]
-Wait, what are the "Booms of Doom?"

32:23.996 --> 32:26.457
Where his dad died. Get in.

32:29.501 --> 32:32.713

32:46.769 --> 32:49.396
-Time for a Denn-defying stunt.
-[horn honking]

32:49.480 --> 32:50.731
Time for a Denn-defying stunt.

32:50.814 --> 32:51.899
Lucas!

32:51.982 --> 32:54.818
-[Lucas whispers] Time...
-Lucas! Don't do it!

32:54.902 --> 32:57.613
Mom. I'm so good, you know?

32:57.696 --> 33:00.532
I don't feel any pain.
I feel so good, Mom!

33:00.616 --> 33:02.868
Lucas. It's the worms.
They're messing with you.

33:02.951 --> 33:06.079
No, no they're not.
They're helping me fulfill his legacy.

33:06.163 --> 33:09.082
OK, Lucas. I know how much
you wanna be close to your dad right now.

33:09.166 --> 33:12.836
-But this is not the way.
-Yes, it is. OK?

33:12.920 --> 33:14.296
Mom, we're exactly the same.

33:14.379 --> 33:15.798
He wanted me to be just like him.

33:15.881 --> 33:17.382
We're a team.
You know, we're father and son.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.051
He wanted me to be just like him.

33:19.134 --> 33:21.678
-No, but you're not like him, Lucas.
-Don't say that to me.

33:21.762 --> 33:23.055
-[Margot exclaims]
-[engine revving]

33:23.138 --> 33:25.015
Mom, get out of my way
before I run you over!

33:25.098 --> 33:27.768
No, I know you're mixed up
and confused right now...

33:27.851 --> 33:31.313
[groans] I'm so sick of everybody
telling me what I am, Mom.

33:31.396 --> 33:33.232
OK? I'm clear. OK?

33:33.315 --> 33:36.068
I'm perfect. And I'm gonna make this run.

33:36.151 --> 33:37.319
Stop! Please!

33:37.402 --> 33:38.570
No! Lucas!

33:39.196 --> 33:40.864
Dammit! Look at me!

33:40.948 --> 33:43.617
Your dad didn't do this run
because he thought he could make it.

33:46.203 --> 33:47.830
[scoffs] What are you talking about?

33:47.913 --> 33:50.165
He did it because he knew he couldn't.

33:51.416 --> 33:52.876
-[motorcycle revving]
-No!

33:52.960 --> 33:55.504
-You're trying to trick me!
-No, she's not. Listen to her, OK?

33:55.587 --> 33:57.089
-He left a note.
-No.

33:57.172 --> 33:58.674
I didn't wanna tell you

33:58.757 --> 34:00.926
because I know how much you idolized him.

34:01.009 --> 34:03.387
-[Lucas] No.
-No, and I didn't wanna ruin that for you.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.390
-But you have to hear the truth.
-No! No.

34:06.473 --> 34:08.475
Listen to me, look at me!

34:08.559 --> 34:11.186
He wanted to die, Lucas,

34:12.938 --> 34:14.690
and this was his way of doing it.

34:14.773 --> 34:15.774
No.

34:15.858 --> 34:18.986
[groans] No!

34:19.069 --> 34:20.904

God, Lucas.

34:36.587 --> 34:38.797
Lucas, I'm so sorry.

34:38.881 --> 34:41.383
I shouldn't have kept it secret,
but I just...

34:41.466 --> 34:43.635
[crying] I miss him so much.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.054
I know, sweetie. I miss him, too.

34:46.972 --> 34:49.182
-I'm really sorry, Mom.
-Oh, God.

34:50.934 --> 34:53.854
You never have to apologize to me, OK?

34:53.937 --> 34:56.356
-OK.
-I mean, you do.

34:57.316 --> 34:59.484
But not for something like this, OK?

35:04.364 --> 35:06.366
I'm never gonna lie to you again.

35:06.450 --> 35:09.077
OK. I mean,
I'll probably lie to you, but...

-I love you.

What's that I'm feeling?

35:19.880 --> 35:22.966
An emotional moment
between mother and son?

35:23.050 --> 35:25.344
No, no, I feel something,
like, in the ground,

-They want me back.
-Lucas.

They want me back.

39:53.653 --> 39:55.238
It's just… It's just me.

39:55.322 --> 39:57.491
I mean, um, Officer Hodgson.

39:57.574 --> 40:00.619
Nora? What happened here?

40:01.369 --> 40:03.997
Yeah. Well, um, funny thing…

40:05.832 --> 40:07.083

[whispers] I am just so...

40:13.632 --> 40:16.468
sick of lying.

40:22.974 --> 40:23.975
OK.

40:25.519 --> 40:28.355
I'm gonna tell you everything
that happened here.

40:29.564 --> 40:31.733
I'm not crazy.

40:31.816 --> 40:33.318
I'm telling the truth.

40:33.401 --> 40:36.238
There were giant worms everywhere.

40:36.988 --> 40:39.324
And this all has to do
with the ghost of a dead kid.

40:39.407 --> 40:42.244
Why is nobody listening to me?

40:42.327 --> 40:44.746
She's been through a lot
with Dennis dying.

40:46.915 --> 40:48.500
You brought her to the right place.

40:50.126 --> 40:51.461
I'll take care of her now.
