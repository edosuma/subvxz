WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:10.577
Well, I think we've got time
for one last caller.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.079
Go ahead, Mindy, I'm listening
.

00:13.079 --> 00:16.248
(softly):
It's about my mother, Dr. Crane.

00:16.248 --> 00:17.817
Ever since I got married
she's been...

00:17.817 --> 00:21.287
Yes, the cashmere
turtleneck is $39.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.756
Excuse me, what?

00:22.756 --> 00:26.593
Sorry, I work in catalog sales
and my boss just walked past.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.061
So anyway, my mom...

00:28.061 --> 00:30.096
Yes, it's on sale until
the end of the month.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.598
Mindy, we are
pressed for time.

00:31.598 --> 00:32.598
Hold on, Frasier.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.535
Cashmere for
under 40 bucks?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.837
I'll take one
in black.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.239
In medium.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.740
Wait, is that medium-medium

00:40.740 --> 00:44.077
or unrealistic-
anorexic-model-medium?

00:44.077 --> 00:48.248
It sounds like you might
want to go for the large.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.082
Oh, really?

00:49.082 --> 00:50.450
And that's our show.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.319
What size will Roz order?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.321
Will she accessorize?

00:55.822 --> 00:58.324
Tune in tomorrow for
the exciting conclusion.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.126
Good day, Seattle.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.462
Dynamite show, Doc,
one of your best.

01:02.462 --> 01:05.532
Rosalinda, great work
on the control panel.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.500
I'm going to start
calling you "Control Freak."

01:07.500 --> 01:09.335
Well, you're probably
wondering

01:09.335 --> 01:11.671
"Who put a quarter in him
today?"

01:11.671 --> 01:14.140
Just got a call
from my lawyer.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.576
My divorce: final.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.446
I'm back
to my tomcat days.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.647
Lock up your daughters, Seattle.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.483
Kenny Daly's on the loose!

01:23.483 --> 01:25.318
You might want to lose
the wedding ring, tomcat.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.686
Oh, yeah.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.155
Time to remove my shackle.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.992
Well, that's weird.

01:32.992 --> 01:34.828
Ooh, that's really stuck.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.663
That's funny.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.165
That's how my wife described our marriage.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.667
"Stuck."

01:41.167 --> 01:43.002
Well, you're not
stuck anymore, are you?!

01:43.002 --> 01:44.337
Oh, damn it, damn it.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.839
Kenny, Kenny,
come on, come on.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.340
Come and sit down.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.341
All right, here.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.844
Take a deep breath.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.345
I'm sorry.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.747
This thing's hit
 me like a ton of bricks.

01:54.747 --> 01:59.452
The only good news is I'll start getting a check every month.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.655
Kenny, um...

02:02.655 --> 02:06.092
divorce can be one of life's most difficult transitions.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.094
Have you considered
seeing a professional

02:08.094 --> 02:09.062
once or twice a week?

02:09.062 --> 02:10.530
I thought about it

02:10.530 --> 02:13.299
but prostitutes are expensive.

02:13.299 --> 02:18.538
He means
a psychiatrist, Kenny.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.074
That is what
you meant, right?

02:21.074 --> 02:22.542
A shrink?
Oh, geez Louise.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.544
I don't think I'd be comfortable talking
to a psychiatrist.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.045
Well, I'm a psychiatrist

02:26.045 --> 02:27.947
You're comfortable
talking to me, aren't you?

02:27.947 --> 02:29.749
Are you offering
to be my shrink?

02:29.749 --> 02:31.117
No.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.585
I could probably handle that.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.554
I was going to refer
you to someone.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.055
Well, can't you
help him, Frasier?

02:36.055 --> 02:38.391
Well, I don't know, Roz.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.726
Giving psychotherapy
to my employer?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.295
It's a bit
of a gray area, isn't it?

02:42.295 --> 02:45.765
Oh, come on, it's not
like he's a real boss.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.268
Yeah, Roz is right.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.270
Come on, Doc, I could use a little help.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.740
Well, I suppose if you'd like to stop by my place

02:53.740 --> 02:55.241
and discuss your feelings
informally,

02:55.241 --> 02:56.743
there'd be no harm in that

02:56.743 --> 02:58.745
Thanks, Doc.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.213
And I'm paying
 you for your time.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.015
Oh, no, no,
that's hardly necessary.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.250
No, no, no, no, no, I insist.
Now what do you get?

03:04.250 --> 03:06.152
Kenny, don't worry about it. I'll gladly do it for free

03:06.653 --> 03:08.054
What do you say we get together
Friday night?

03:08.054 --> 03:09.455
Thanks, Doc.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.458
I wish my ex-wife
was as agreeable as you.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.761
And dead.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.930
Okay, maybe tonight's better

03:23.236 --> 03:25.238
And the one time I was winning

03:25.238 --> 03:27.740
my dad "accidentally"
knocked over the checkerboard.

03:27.740 --> 03:28.741
Ah.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.578
He made me pick up
all the pieces, too.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.846
Fortunately, my mom was there
with an extra piece of cake.

03:34.314 --> 03:35.748
(cries)

03:37.183 --> 03:38.685
I see.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.688
A controlling,
narcissistic father

03:42.188 --> 03:43.690
and an overprotective mother.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.693
It has all the earmarks

03:46.693 --> 03:49.629
of a classic
Oedipus complex.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.531
Well, well...

03:51.531 --> 03:55.435
old friend, we meet again.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.737
Now let me tell you

03:57.737 --> 04:00.106
your deep-rooted feeli
ngs of castration...

04:00.106 --> 04:02.108
(watch timer beeping)

04:02.609 --> 04:04.410
I'm afraid
our time is up

04:04.410 --> 04:06.646
Wait. What?!

04:06.646 --> 04:08.648
This has been fascinating.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.650
I believe we are
finally on the brink

04:10.650 --> 04:11.651
of discovering a road

04:12.151 --> 04:13.152
into some real insights.

04:13.653 --> 04:14.153
I can't tell you

04:14.654 --> 04:17.055
I believe I'm as
exhilarated as you are.

04:17.457 --> 04:18.491
Yeah.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.426
When are we going
to talk about my divorce?

04:20.426 --> 04:24.797
You may not know it, Kenny,
but we already are.

04:24.797 --> 04:28.801
Now, for our next session,
I want you to write a letter

04:28.801 --> 04:31.804
telling your father
how you feel.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.807
Don't send it, just write it.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.310
Homework? You never
said there was going
to be any homework.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.811
It's all part of the process

04:38.811 --> 04:40.313
Good night, Kenny.
But I...

04:42.649 --> 04:44.984
Geez, I thought
that'd never end.

04:45.184 --> 04:47.153
Dad, how long have you
been in there?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.856
The whole damn time.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.190
I went in for a beer

04:51.190 --> 04:52.692
and Kenny came in and started crying

04:52.692 --> 04:54.694
and I was trapped.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.195
How's talking about checkers

04:56.195 --> 04:58.531
supposed to help him
through a divorce?

04:58.531 --> 05:00.833
Dad, the inability to maintain
adult relationships

05:00.833 --> 05:05.204
often has its roots
in parent-child trauma.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.607
What's your generation going to do when we're all gone

05:07.607 --> 05:10.977
and there's no one left
to blame?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.879
I really can't tell you
how exciting it is

05:12.879 --> 05:15.782
to roll up my sleeves again
and delve into someone's psyche.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.216
I don't even
 know where to begin

05:17.216 --> 05:19.719
Although, you know,
I do think it's
particularly salient

05:19.719 --> 05:21.220
that the father never showed any interest

05:21.220 --> 05:23.723
in the things that were
most important to his son.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.725
Sounds good, Fras. Bye.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.627
Oh. Hey, Martin.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.063
Oh, hi, Kenny.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.931
I didn't know you were here.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.299
How's it going?

05:33.299 --> 05:34.801
Okay, I guess.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.808
I have an emotionally
crippled father.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.810
You don't say.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.113
So where are you headed?

05:47.113 --> 05:48.915
Uh, gonna grab a beer
at McGinty's.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.350
Really?

05:50.350 --> 05:54.207
Well, I'm sure dehydrated after all that crying.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.464
You mind if I tag along
with you?

06:04.464 --> 06:06.265
(elevator bell dings)
Sure, why not?

06:06.265 --> 06:07.734
Oh, thanks, Martin

06:07.734 --> 06:09.769
I really appreciate it

06:10.269 --> 06:11.771
(cries):
I bet you were a great dad.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.773
Oh, geez.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.744
If you want to learn yoga,

06:17.744 --> 06:20.246
why do we need some
fancy private teacher?

06:20.246 --> 06:23.116
There are classes we could take
together down at the Y.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.450
Yes, and afterwards

06:24.450 --> 06:26.953
there are anti-fungal lotions
we can use together, too.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.022
Just give Ahmrit a chance.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.525
If we don't achieve physical and spiritual harmony,

06:32.525 --> 06:33.493
the second lesson's free

06:34.961 --> 06:35.962
Oh, hello, you two.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.963
Hey, Frasier.
Hi.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.967
Ooh, Freud,
Bettelheim... Jung?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.902
Someone's playing
with the big boys.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.138
Yes, well, it's for my patient

06:45.471 --> 06:46.539
You're seeing patients again?

06:46.539 --> 06:49.409
Well, just this one
for the last three weeks.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.778
Very challenging case, too.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.280
The man has father issues,
any number of neuroses

06:54.781 --> 06:56.649
and a phobia or two.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.484
Sounds to me like you've hit the crackpot.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.154
(chuckling)

07:01.154 --> 07:02.655
I'm sorry.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.607
I heard it at a convention.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.194
So how did you meet
this new patient?

07:08.194 --> 07:09.495
Well, I can't really say, Daphne.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.331
You know, doctor-patient
confidentiality...

07:12.331 --> 07:14.333
Hey, shrink buddy!

07:14.333 --> 07:15.835
Hi, Niles.
Hi, Daphne.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.336
Hello, Kenny, how are you?
Hello.

07:17.336 --> 07:20.840
Well, if you'll excuse us,we're off to buy sticky mats

07:20.840 --> 07:22.809
All right.
There we go.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.343
Kenny, have a seat,
have a seat.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.846
So, how are you feeling?

07:26.846 --> 07:28.347
Like a new man

07:28.347 --> 07:29.682
Last night was just what I needed.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.452
I can't tell you how gratifying it is to hear that.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.188
Yeah, me and your dad
shut down McGinty's.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.457
Really? You and Dad?

07:37.690 --> 07:39.258
Yeah, actually, I'm meeting him here for coffee.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.760
Man, is he a hoot.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.662
He made me completely forget
about my problems.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.030
Well, good for you.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.798
Of course...

07:46.032 --> 07:48.601
the object is not to forget
about one's problems;

07:48.601 --> 07:50.536
it's to understand them.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.372
Of course, that can take
a lot of work.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.208
About the work part...

07:55.708 --> 07:58.211
your dad said something last
night that made a lot of sense.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.712
He said I should get out more.

07:59.712 --> 08:01.714
And I was thinking that's going to be tough to do

08:01.714 --> 08:04.217
if I'm seeing you twice a week, plus doing all that homework.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.219
I guess what
I'm saying is.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.221
I want to quit.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.555
Kenny...

08:09.555 --> 08:10.857
I understand it must be painful

08:11.357 --> 08:14.861
to uncover what is
a very painful past.

08:14.861 --> 08:18.364
But I must warn you that
if you run away from this now

08:18.865 --> 08:20.366
you will only be
repeating a pattern

08:20.366 --> 08:22.835
that will prolong
your unhappiness.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.204
I'm okay with that.

08:25.204 --> 08:28.140
In these past few sessions,
we have discovered territory

08:28.140 --> 08:30.142
that usually takes months
to reach.

08:30.142 --> 08:34.013
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I've been on fire.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.414
Don't get me wrong, Doc.
You've been great.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.917
It's just... it's not for me.

08:37.917 --> 08:38.918
Hey, guys.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.419
Hey-Hey, it's
Party Hearty Marty!

08:41.419 --> 08:43.054
Hey-Hey, it's, uh...

08:43.054 --> 08:44.123
Sir Shots-A-Lot.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.025
Right. Hey!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.060
Dad, can I have a word
with you for a second?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.128
Yeah, sure.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.596
Oh, I'll get
 us some coffee.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.598
Nice guy.

08:52.598 --> 08:56.435
Doesn't hold his liquor like you think he would.

08:56.435 --> 08:58.237
Did you tell him that
he should go out more?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.171
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

08:59.639 --> 09:00.540
Well...

09:00.540 --> 09:03.442
he is using it as an excuse
to quit therapy.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.944
After one night out
with you in a bar,

09:04.944 --> 09:09.282
the man is ready to throw away
three weeks of intense analysis.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.117
Fras, the guy's finally having a little fun.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.385
Don't you want
 him to be happy?

09:12.385 --> 09:16.155
I am not trying
to make him happy.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.592
I am trying to cure
his depression.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.297
Hey, Marty, does this
remind you of anything?

09:24.297 --> 09:27.300
Ow! Hot! Hot!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.802
Get the man
some water, would you?

09:32.605 --> 09:35.608
And breathe...

09:35.608 --> 09:39.579
Daphne, that is
an amazing Downward Dog.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.847
Thank you.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.649
What about me, yogi?

09:43.649 --> 09:46.152
How does my Downward Dog look?

09:46.552 --> 09:48.087
Oh, dear.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.557
Can we straighten
these legs?

09:51.557 --> 09:52.925
Oh, I wish

09:53.259 --> 09:54.327
Congenitally
shortened hamstrings

09:54.327 --> 09:56.295
are the curse of the Cranes.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.764
Well, let's try
a different pose then.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.267
Slowly place your left leg
between your hands

10:01.267 --> 10:03.769
pivot your right heel down,
straighten your legs

10:03.769 --> 10:05.271
put your left arm on your ankle.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.275
Raise your right arm and...
triangle pose.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.043
Trikonasana.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.347
Niles, just
use a block.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.348
I don'’ need a block.
You do.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.849
No, I really don't.
I don't like the block.

10:16.849 --> 10:17.750
I don't want to touch...
Use a block.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.622
And breathe...

10:22.622 --> 10:26.125
And slowly
bring your back leg up

10:26.125 --> 10:28.427
into Half-Moon pose.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.366
Now feel your breath
leaving your body

10:33.366 --> 10:35.635
like a note being blown
from a flute.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
.
Yes, I feel it

10:36.636 --> 10:37.536
Great.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.472
I'm a flute, too, yogi.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.407
Yes, of course you are.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.809
Let's straighten that leg, Niles.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.810
Straighten it,
straighten it out.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.078
Straighten it out;
there we are.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.847
That feels good;
yeah, okay

10:47.847 --> 10:48.848
Let's try again, Niles.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.349
Let's try and straighten
that leg.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.351
You can do it.
Straighten that leg.
Marvel...

10:52.351 --> 10:53.352
That's much better.
Okay, okay, all right.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.354
All right, let's bend
the finger, Niles.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.156
Let's bend the finger.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.860
Isn't this
wonderful, Niles?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.828
I love it.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.131
And breathe.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.467
And be completely
in this moment.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.970
Shut off the outside world
entirely.

11:10.970 --> 11:11.971
(cell phone rings)

11:16.042 --> 11:17.543
Oh, hi, Mom.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.545
I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.548
Yes, I'm coming. I told you, I'm bringing the lentils

11:22.548 --> 11:24.483
What do you mean again?
You love lentils.

11:24.483 --> 11:26.919
Niles, straighten the leg,
straighten the leg.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.422
Okay, child's pose, that's good.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.191
So what if Jerry
brings a different
dish to every meal

11:32.191 --> 11:34.026
d.
It doesn't make him a go

11:34.026 --> 11:35.494
Has Jerry achieved inner peace?

11:35.494 --> 11:38.030
I'm just asking, Mom,
has Jerry achieved inner peace?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.966
I have to take this call.
Would you please excuse me?

11:42.401 --> 11:44.403
(sighs):
That was fantastic

11:44.403 --> 11:45.705
I feel so energized.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.040
Well, you are really good.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.875
I hope I'm not holding you back.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.011
Oh, no, you're
doing wonderfully.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.345
He's paying you
so much attention.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.247
I think he sees real potential.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.683
You don't have to soothe my ego.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.185
Yoga isn't about competition

11:59.185 --> 12:01.187
it's about achieving
enlightenment

12:01.187 --> 12:05.191
and integrating your inner
and outer lives.

12:12.898 --> 12:13.966
Hello.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.470
Well, this
is awkward.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.474
I believe
you know Martin.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.844
Yes,
we've already met.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.113
Kenny, there's no reason to feel awkward.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.582
Believe me, I have other things
to do with my evening

12:30.082 --> 12:32.518
than to share my expertise
with someone who could use it.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.954
Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.422
So, we still on
for McGinty's tonight?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.456
Yeah, sure

12:37.957 --> 12:38.958
And Kenny, I've been thinking

12:38.958 --> 12:40.459
about what you've been going through

12:40.459 --> 12:43.462
and I've come
up with the answer.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.964
A suede jacket

12:44.964 --> 12:47.466
Did you hear that?

12:47.466 --> 12:48.968
A suede jacket!

12:49.401 --> 12:52.905
I must have missed that lecture
at Harvard Medical School.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.342
You look good in it
and women love to feel it.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.678
It's like you're a feast
for all the senses.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.448
I used to have a suede
coat when I was single

13:02.448 --> 13:04.416
Hester made me put it away

13:04.416 --> 13:08.420
but I'd pull it out
whenever we'd have a fight

13:08.420 --> 13:11.357
and in a minute,
she'd be purring like a kitten

13:11.357 --> 13:14.126
You should break
it out again.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.461
Oh-ho! At my age?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.963
It would kill me.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.865
Hey, you got time
to do a little shopping?

13:19.865 --> 13:22.067
Sure. I think I got
my good credit card with me.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.139
Leather won't cure
your problems, Kenny.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.308
It's a temporary high.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.110
MARTIN: Hi, guys.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.311
NILES:
Hi.
DAPHNE:
Hello.

13:32.611 --> 13:33.646
Oh, Niles, Daphne.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.947
Hi, come join me.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.716
Two low-fat lattes,
a hazelnut biscotti...

13:37.716 --> 13:39.218
And one blueberry scone.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.153
Your brother set such a brisk pace

13:41.153 --> 13:42.154
walking over here,

13:42.154 --> 13:43.656
I could barely
keep up with him.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.658
Now, Daphne, you
don't need to do that.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.692
Why not?

13:46.692 --> 13:48.160
Shouldn't I be proud

13:48.160 --> 13:49.995
of my husband's brisk pace?

13:51.897 --> 13:53.332
Daphne's trying
to build up my ego

13:53.833 --> 13:54.834
because she
out-performed me at yoga.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.235
It's not a competition.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.672
You see? He's already
mastered the teachings.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.007
Spiritually,
you're way ahead of me.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.342
Stop it.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.844
Frasier, wasn't
that your PatientX

14:04.844 --> 14:06.145
that was leaving
with Dad?

14:06.145 --> 14:07.479
Yes, now my ex-Patient X.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.981
Actually, I'd like
to discuss it with you

14:08.981 --> 14:09.882
if you've got a few minutes.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.317
Coincidentally, I just read

14:11.317 --> 14:13.319
a fascinating paper
on early termination.

14:13.319 --> 14:14.687
Yeah, the hypothesis was...

14:14.687 --> 14:16.455
I think I'll get
something to eat.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.756
Oh, you have
something here

14:17.756 --> 14:18.757
Something else.

14:18.757 --> 14:19.758
Well, here, try mine.

14:19.758 --> 14:20.759
Please, just
let me go.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.764
So, so, whose
decision was it

14:25.764 --> 14:26.765
to terminate
your sessions?

14:26.765 --> 14:28.267
Kenny.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.151
I see. Well, uh.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.437
early individuation
can stem from anything

14:31.437 --> 14:33.806
from transfers to delayed
adolescent rebellion.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.442
If only it were
that complicated, Niles.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.643
What happened?

14:37.643 --> 14:39.044
Well, it's Dad!

14:39.044 --> 14:41.547
He's been taking Kenny
to McGinty's every night

14:41.547 --> 14:44.550
He's giving him therapy
in the form of beer and fun.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.720
Poor Kenny.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.154
I know.

14:49.154 --> 14:50.522
I've got to do something

14:50.522 --> 14:53.392
I-I-I can't just stand by while Dad undermines me.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.761
Oh, just be careful not to turn
this into a competition.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.563
As analysts,
we have to be above that.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.898
ROZ:
Hey, Niles

14:58.898 --> 15:02.868
I hear Daphne kicked
your ass at yoga.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.870
Oh, yeah? Well, Frasier
just lost a patient.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.447
Nice Bhujangasana, Daphne.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.950
And yours is very nice too, Niles.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.853
You're doing so much better this week.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.721
Thank you. I just did
what you suggested

15:22.721 --> 15:25.724
and imagined myself having
the reptilian sinuousness

15:25.724 --> 15:27.993
of a lizard scuttling
across the desert floor.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.662
I thought I said
rain forest.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.097
You did, but I
don't like the damp.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.034
This next move is a little trickier.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.069
ne.
I'll demonstrate on Daph

15:37.069 --> 15:39.939
First of all, bring up
your knees, like this...

15:39.939 --> 15:43.409
Now bring your arms back
towards your ankles.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.911
Ooh! I don't think I can do this one.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.413
It hurts.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.414
Don't push.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.849
You should be feeling
discomfort, not pain.

15:50.849 --> 15:56.221
If you feel pain, ease yourself
gently back towards discomfort.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.190
Is it something
like this, Yogi?

15:58.691 --> 16:00.059
(gasps)

16:00.059 --> 16:05.464
AHMRIT:
I'm impressed, Niles.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.800
you might be able to
achieve Upward Bow--

16:07.800 --> 16:09.635
Urdhbadhanurasana.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.070
Oh, you mean
this one?

16:14.006 --> 16:14.907
Yes.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.310
Oh, remind me to tell Rosa
to vacuum the sisal.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.812
I'm speechless, Niles.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.815
I've never seen such
a rapid improvement.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.217
How do you do that?

16:25.217 --> 16:27.453
Oh, I think I tweaked a
muscle on that last pose.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.221
Oh, no. We should put
some ice on that.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.556
Good idea.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.858
I guess we know who's
better at yoga now.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.194
Now, Daphne,
there's no "better."

16:35.461 --> 16:39.331
It's all about achieving
oneness of body and spirit.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.499
Okay.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.369
Now I need you
to take me to the hospital.

16:43.802 --> 16:44.870
What?

16:44.870 --> 16:46.839
I broke my body.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.375
I dislocated my shoulder and...

16:49.375 --> 16:53.345
I think that one of my ribs
has achieved two-ness.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.682
What's going on?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.651
Ahmrit and I were just going
to go out and get a chai tea.

16:59.651 --> 17:00.519
Can we get you one?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.854
No, thanks.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.889
You're amazing!
You have so much energy.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.156
Ah, well...

17:05.156 --> 17:06.992
You know what they say..

17:07.492 --> 17:08.694
Quickly, quickly.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.329
Imagine the pain leaving your body

17:11.530 --> 17:12.531
like a wisp of smoke.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.367
If you could get the door,
I'm starting to hemorrhage.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.742
FRASIER:
Hello.

17:24.742 --> 17:25.676
Hey!

17:25.676 --> 17:26.744
What are you
doing here, Fras?

17:27.246 --> 17:28.747
Just thought maybe
the three of us

17:28.747 --> 17:29.748
could have
a little chat.

17:29.748 --> 17:30.749
Doc, this is Trudy.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.252
Ah. Delighted,
I'm sure.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.054
Hey.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.456
I'd love to stay and chat, Doc,

17:37.956 --> 17:38.957
but me and Trudy

17:38.957 --> 17:40.726
have a dinner date with the Colonel

17:40.726 --> 17:43.862
Well, if you think
you're ready for that.

17:43.862 --> 17:44.696
Well, I'm not
hungry now,

17:45.197 --> 17:46.498
but I probably will be when we get there.

17:46.698 --> 17:47.766
See you guys later

17:48.267 --> 17:49.268
Nice to meet you.

17:49.768 --> 17:50.769
Likewise,
I'm sure.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.773
Have a great time!

17:54.773 --> 17:55.774
He's doomed.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.276
What are you
talking about?

17:57.276 --> 17:58.777
He scored and she's a cheap date.

17:58.777 --> 17:59.778
Oh, Dad, please.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.280
He is not ready
for a relationship.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.215
How could you let him
do something like that?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.150
Don't blame me for that; it was the jacket.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.152
He wasn't here ten minutes
before she wanted to touch it.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.087
You know what?

18:08.554 --> 18:10.122
All you're doing
is allowing him

18:10.122 --> 18:11.623
to wallow in his
state of denial

18:11.623 --> 18:13.625
and what if she
rejects him, hmm?

18:13.625 --> 18:15.561
The man already has
abandonment issues.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.996
Oh, would you cut out the psychological mumbo-jumbo?

18:18.497 --> 18:19.431
Let the guy have
a good time.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.766
What did you just say?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.267
I said let the guy have some fun.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.268
No, before that.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.137
You said "psychological
mumbo-jumbo."

18:25.437 --> 18:27.005
So that's how you
characterize my life's work?

18:27.439 --> 18:28.440
I'm just saying

18:28.440 --> 18:30.409
that I don't think therapy is for everybody.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.411
Like Kenny-- he just
needed to loosen up.

18:32.411 --> 18:33.612
Oh, really?

18:33.612 --> 18:36.448
So tell me,
Dr. Party-Hardy Marty...

18:38.283 --> 18:42.454
Who, in your expert opinion,
does need therapy?

18:43.255 --> 18:45.257
Well...

18:45.257 --> 18:47.025
Hitler.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.131
Hitler.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.932
Yes, and that woman

18:53.932 --> 18:56.935
with all the different personalities, um...

18:56.935 --> 18:58.437
Sybil.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.140
Hitler.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.574
And Sybil.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.544
Anyone else?

19:07.479 --> 19:08.380
No.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.584
Great!

19:12.818 --> 19:14.386
An entire science

19:14.386 --> 19:17.689
devoted to Hitler and Sybil.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.324
Do you believe that...

19:19.625 --> 19:21.660
that Niles and I have been
wasting our lives?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.962
Do you think Mom
wasted her life?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.230
Now, you calm down, Frasier.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.733
I'm just saying that you overcomplicate things.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.235
Yes, Kenny needed to
talk out some problems

19:30.235 --> 19:33.739
but he didn't need to analyze every moment of his childhood.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.707
That's when it gets into the mumbo-jumbo.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.676
I'm just trying to get
to the root of his problems.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.645
You know what? I think
you needed to give therapy

19:39.645 --> 19:40.646
more than he needed to get it.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.147
And you know what I think?

19:42.147 --> 19:43.949
I think I'm finished
listening to you.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
All right, fine,
maybe I did enjoy it.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.253
Look, it's what
I was trained to do.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.555
It's what I love to do

19:49.555 --> 19:51.857
and I still think I was
doing Kenny some good.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.358
Well, Frasier, you know,

19:53.358 --> 19:54.860
Kenny's not the only one with mental problems.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.295
And what is that
supposed to mean?

19:56.662 --> 19:59.131
Well, it means you can start
seeing other patients.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.499
Oh, right, right.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.301
Well, I've, I've thought
about that.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.503
Why not, if you love it?

20:04.836 --> 20:07.406
You know, perhaps I could
start seeing people

20:07.406 --> 20:08.907
a couple of nights a week.

20:08.907 --> 20:12.244
I could even convert Daphne's
old room into an office.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.580
Well, if you do,
while they're waiting,

20:14.580 --> 20:17.015
they're watching
what I want to watch

20:18.417 --> 20:19.418
Hey, guys.

20:19.418 --> 20:20.419
Kenny!
Kenny!

20:20.419 --> 20:21.420
What happened?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.387
Are you
all right?

20:22.921 --> 20:24.423
I don't think Trudy
and I are a fit.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.391
When we got to the parking lot,

20:26.391 --> 20:28.727
her boyfriend pushed me down
and took my jacket.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.528
Aw...

20:29.528 --> 20:30.963
MARTIN:
I'm sorry.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.365
I feel like such a loser.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.866
No, you're not a loser

20:34.866 --> 20:37.369
and if you need
to talk about this-

20:37.369 --> 20:39.771
Frasier's pretty good at this sort of thing.

20:39.771 --> 20:43.041
Well, Kenny, I tell you what.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.876
Whenever you're
ready, okay?

20:44.876 --> 20:47.379
For the time being,
why don't you

20:47.379 --> 20:50.382
let a couple of buddies
get you a beer, okay?

20:50.382 --> 20:51.850
Thanks.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.318
You know,
it's too bad that Trudy

20:53.318 --> 20:55.320
was just setting me up
to get mugged

20:55.320 --> 20:57.322
because up to that point,
we were really cooking.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.825
Well, here's to dating!
