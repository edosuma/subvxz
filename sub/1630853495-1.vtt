-- What the hell
are you wearing?

01:06.172 --> 01:07.267
- You're not going
to the prom

01:07.303 --> 01:08.904
- dressed like a tramp!

01:08.939 --> 01:11.538
- What?

01:11.573 --> 01:14.747
You want me to wear my
communion dress?

01:14.783 --> 01:17.580
I'm 18. You don't own me!

01:17.616 --> 01:19.915
-I hate you!
-- Watch your mouth,
young lady!

01:19.951 --> 01:21.683
Just shut up!

01:21.719 --> 01:24.819
- Well,
if you're not changing,
you're not going!

01:24.855 --> 01:27.755
-To Satan, giver of youth and
-- I'm not going to the prom

01:27.790 --> 01:30.659
-happiness.
-- dressed like
an old spinster!

01:30.694 --> 01:34.260
-- No, no, no!
-Come, almighty Eternal Devil.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.302
- No, no, no!

02:01.095 --> 02:03.426
<i>NYC's top pop radio!</i>

02:03.461 --> 02:05.331
<i>Hello New York!</i>
<i>What a beautiful day.</i>

02:05.366 --> 02:07.760
<i>This one goes out to Jessie</i>
<i>from David who says,</i>

02:07.795 --> 02:09.900
<i>"Let's make some</i>
<i>memories this weekend!"</i>

03:58.047 --> 03:59.973
Oh David, look!
An antique store!

04:00.008 --> 04:02.845
-It looks cute!
Come on, let's go, please?
-No, no.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.450
What about the reservations?
We're running late already.

04:05.485 --> 04:08.515
-The weather's getting bad.
-Are you serious?

04:08.550 --> 04:11.322
-Come on.
-Okay.

04:11.357 --> 04:13.323
You're right.
Let's go antiquing.

04:13.358 --> 04:15.362
-Yay! I love you!

04:19.394 --> 04:20.933
You know what?

04:20.968 --> 04:22.903
This place is awesome.

04:22.938 --> 04:24.536
I knew it would be worth it.

04:28.539 --> 04:31.639
Oh wow.
This place is unbelievable.

04:31.674 --> 04:33.908
I've never seen
anything like this.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.346
Oh, hello.

04:38.381 --> 04:39.817
You know where I'll be.

04:39.852 --> 04:40.680
Okay.

04:40.716 --> 04:42.619
-Have fun.

04:42.654 --> 04:44.957
I need to take some shots
for my blog anyways.

04:44.992 --> 04:46.855
-I'm behind.
-Sure.

04:46.890 --> 04:48.758
-I'll be here when you're done.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.184
-Oh God!
-Hey-- Hey Jessie.

06:27.127 --> 06:28.693
It is you, isn't it?

06:29.459 --> 06:30.724
I'm sorry, who are you?

06:30.760 --> 06:33.560
Oh, I'm...
just one of your fans.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.668
Wow.

06:37.134 --> 06:39.236
Your...

06:39.272 --> 06:41.640
Your skin is so beautiful.

06:44.245 --> 06:46.546
You're even prettier in person.

06:50.416 --> 06:51.915
-You're--
-Oh, please.

06:51.951 --> 06:54.180
-Don't touch me.
-It's cool, it's cool.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

06:58.691 --> 07:03.057
I just... wanted to get a
picture with you?

07:04.063 --> 07:05.158
For my blog?

07:06.001 --> 07:08.133
-Oh, um...

07:09.430 --> 07:10.702
Please?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.868
Yeah, sure.

07:14.903 --> 07:17.236
Cool, cool,
cool, cool. Come here.

07:37.098 --> 07:38.497
Hey. How's it going?

07:38.532 --> 07:40.497
Good, good. There's some
cool stuff in here.

07:40.532 --> 07:42.096
-Glad we stopped.

07:42.971 --> 07:44.032
Look at this.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.106
-It's sort of cute.

07:49.141 --> 07:50.277
What is it?

07:50.312 --> 07:53.012
I don't know.
Some 1920's creature.

07:53.047 --> 07:56.542
Can you believe someone thought
this was like a great gift
for a baby?

07:56.578 --> 08:00.920
Well, it sure
explains why my parents
are so dysfunctional.

08:00.956 --> 08:02.483
-Hmm.
-Oh!

08:02.518 --> 08:05.553
I think I'll take a pic
with this and send it out
to all my crazy fans.

08:07.593 --> 08:09.624
-You know what?

08:09.659 --> 08:11.126
I hate it when you do that.

08:11.161 --> 08:14.398
I don't like having my face
plastered all over the internet.

08:14.434 --> 08:16.002
Especially not with that thing.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.001
It's a toy, David.

08:18.037 --> 08:21.739
I mean, I'm posting it
as a part of my vacation
for my fans.

08:21.775 --> 08:24.575
Come on, after all,
you are the love of my life.

08:24.610 --> 08:26.575
Yeah, well,
I love you too, baby.

08:26.610 --> 08:28.549
But that thing is horrible!

08:29.450 --> 08:31.244
-Let's hit the road, huh?
-Okay.

09:12.554 --> 09:13.825
You okay?

09:14.996 --> 09:16.288
I'm sorry.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.127
Hm? I didn't mean to
explode at you. I just...

09:19.902 --> 09:21.027
I just...

09:21.063 --> 09:23.604
I detest the whole
social media thing.

09:24.436 --> 09:25.837
And I hate selfies.

09:26.404 --> 09:27.740
That's not it.

09:28.275 --> 09:29.742
It's something else.

09:31.441 --> 09:32.745
Well, what?

09:33.713 --> 09:36.647
There was this guy
at the antique mall.

09:36.682 --> 09:38.850
He came up behind me
and scared me.

09:40.418 --> 09:42.150
What the fuck?

09:44.052 --> 09:47.353
Said he recognized me,
was a fan.

09:47.388 --> 09:51.125
Just wanted a photo with me,
but he... touched me.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.700
God, you know I hate when
strangers touch me.

09:55.003 --> 09:56.637
So, go on.

09:57.902 --> 10:01.373
Well, he took the photo
and just vanished.

10:01.408 --> 10:03.204
I mean, he just disappeared.

10:04.641 --> 10:06.273
Really creeped me out.

10:09.711 --> 10:11.146
You see, Jessie?

10:12.287 --> 10:14.017
That's what I'm talking about.

10:15.282 --> 10:19.057
If you post your
entire life on social media,

10:19.092 --> 10:21.921
I mean,
you have to expect
that you're gonna get

10:21.957 --> 10:24.356
some creepy guys following you.

10:24.391 --> 10:28.135
Literally, doing
God know what
with your photo.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.029
Oh, Jessie! Oh, my God!

10:30.064 --> 10:32.233
-God, you're such a jerk!
-Ow!

10:33.140 --> 10:34.169
I'm sorry.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.107
You'll be okay.

11:09.805 --> 11:13.340
Where's the entrance to this
highway? It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.980
I can see, it's right there!

11:20.382 --> 11:23.185
-Goddamnit!
This is not the highway!

11:26.223 --> 11:28.289
What? We're going
to be late for our reservation.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.130
You know how funny
these B&B people can get.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.268
And you know what?
I don't wanna get stuck
in some cramped room.

11:36.303 --> 11:37.195
Can you call them?

11:37.231 --> 11:39.900
God! You know,
you need to chill.

11:39.936 --> 11:41.402
-Yeah.
-So what if we're late?

11:41.437 --> 11:44.908
-They charged my credit card
in advance anyways.
-Yeah.

11:44.943 --> 11:47.944
-You're right.
-I know! David, my favorite!

11:50.383 --> 11:51.879
Yeah, uh-huh.

11:51.914 --> 11:55.121
♪ Your hands on the wheel

11:55.157 --> 11:58.050

Oh! Got it! It's the tractor
on the yellow road sign!

12:26.817 --> 12:28.816
How are you so good at this?

12:28.851 --> 12:31.052
Okay, my turn. Hmm...

12:31.087 --> 12:34.052
-I'm gonna make this tough.
-Great.

12:34.088 --> 12:37.925
Okay. I spy something red.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.935
Well, it better not be a cop
pulling us over. I'm driving
way over the speed limit.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.367
-Oh, it's that barn over there?
-Oh, you are so cold.

12:47.408 --> 12:49.805
Um... Is it your car?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.546
No, but you're getting warmer.

12:52.581 --> 12:55.915
-Here, I'll give you a hint.
-Okay.

12:57.383 --> 12:58.544
Take a peek.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.955
Oh, my God.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.053
-Babe, stop doing that.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.428
Don't be such a grouch.

13:08.463 --> 13:10.095
-Jessie.

13:10.130 --> 13:13.300
-What are you doing?
Would you stop doing that?
-What?

13:14.830 --> 13:16.632
Oh, fuck! Shit!

13:16.667 --> 13:18.034
- My phone!

13:18.069 --> 13:20.566
-Uh, we're gonna
have to pull over.
-Great.

13:30.012 --> 13:31.511
I don't fucking believe this.

13:33.148 --> 13:35.955
How the hell did this get here?

13:40.121 --> 13:41.694
Jessie! What are you doing?

13:41.729 --> 13:45.057
My phone! It's ruined!
God, now what?

13:45.092 --> 13:46.761
Thank God.

13:46.797 --> 13:48.165
Wait, what is that?

13:52.237 --> 13:54.402
-Is that the thing from
the antique mall?
-Yeah.

13:55.736 --> 13:58.572
-Well, get it out of my tire!
-I don't want to touch it!

13:58.607 --> 14:01.178
I'll just leave it
stuck in there.
I'll put on the spare.

14:03.315 --> 14:06.579
Oh, David? I got a flat a while
back and I used the spare.

14:06.614 --> 14:10.286
-I guess I forgot about
getting a new one.
-Okay.

14:10.321 --> 14:12.792
Do you have roadside coverage?
You can use my phone?

14:12.828 --> 14:14.925
No. But if you get
this thing out of my tire,

14:14.960 --> 14:16.424
we can drive
to a service station.

14:16.460 --> 14:19.266
Well, I don't know how far
we can get with a flat tire.

14:19.301 --> 14:23.398
It's fine. Just get it out of
my tire, all right?
I hate this area.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.321
Oh, I'm taking it.

14:46.289 --> 14:48.654
What?
I want to know
how it got there!

15:27.098 --> 15:29.200
This place is a ghost town.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.109
- Jess, I'm afraid
the axle is gonna break.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.551
Let's just park and find
a place to stay.

16:08.774 --> 16:10.907
Look at this building.

16:10.942 --> 16:12.738
It could be right out of France.

16:13.581 --> 16:14.908
You mean hotel.

16:14.943 --> 16:16.577
- Huh?

16:16.613 --> 16:19.652
This building that you're
drooling over instead of me?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.520
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's a hotel.

16:21.556 --> 16:23.122
There's a sign. See?

16:23.956 --> 16:26.785
Well, let's get our overnights.

16:44.107 --> 16:45.945
It says use the back entrance.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.581
I guess this place
is called Monroe Manor.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.117
Oh! Pretty and smart.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.282
Well, someone has to be the
brains behind this outfit.

16:53.317 --> 16:56.848
Well then, Einstein,
let's follow the arrows.

16:56.884 --> 16:59.519
I know you're pissed off but
this could be fun, right?

16:59.554 --> 17:02.788
A little adventure,
spontaneous, excitement.

17:03.995 --> 17:05.725
I'd rather be in Saratoga.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.242
-Norman!

17:19.278 --> 17:21.678
-Norman are you home?
-Okay, that's not funny.

17:24.584 --> 17:25.646
- Huh.

17:29.418 --> 17:32.518
-Jeez! Don't do that.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.521
God, this place gives
me the creeps.

17:34.556 --> 17:39.194
Yeah, but I like
the architecture in here.

17:39.229 --> 17:43.862
I'll have to ask about it and
take some photos before the
partners meeting next week.

17:44.637 --> 17:46.601
Yes, yes!

17:47.268 --> 17:49.668
This building is a gem.

17:49.704 --> 17:52.743
It was constructed
in 1898 as the City Hall.

17:52.778 --> 17:57.714
But then the owner's family
purchased it in 1982
and did renovations.

17:57.749 --> 17:59.012
But then...

17:59.048 --> 18:00.783
Plans changed.

18:00.819 --> 18:02.521
Things happened.

18:02.557 --> 18:03.549
But no worries!

18:03.584 --> 18:07.227
I am Salim.
Welcome to Monroe Manor.

18:07.262 --> 18:11.725
Well, hi, Salim.
I'm David Bradley,
and this is Jessie.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.494
Now we're broken down
out the front with a flat tire,

18:14.529 --> 18:18.098
no spare, so we need
a place to stay.

18:18.133 --> 18:20.167
Flat and no spare.

18:20.202 --> 18:22.640
Hmm.

18:22.675 --> 18:27.378
Well, bad storm's
blowing in tonight.
Town is shutting up early.

18:27.414 --> 18:29.446
You're gonna have to deal
with that tomorrow morning.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.284
Lucky for you,
I do have a vacancy
in one of our best suites.

18:34.319 --> 18:37.256
And our chef is serving
dinner until 9 P.M.

18:39.089 --> 18:42.026
Place seems pretty dead.

18:42.061 --> 18:44.128
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:44.163 --> 18:46.830
There are other
guests here, Jessie.

18:46.865 --> 18:50.036
It's just there have been
so many cancellations
due to the bad weather.

18:50.071 --> 18:51.499
And as you can see,
we are short-staffed.

18:51.535 --> 18:55.274
But don't worry about
any of that, all right?

18:55.309 --> 18:58.540
Tonight, you and David will
have me at your service.

18:58.576 --> 19:03.475
So, all I need from you is,
if you could just...

19:03.510 --> 19:05.414
...sign the guest register.

19:05.449 --> 19:07.717
Don't you just
swipe a card or something?

19:07.752 --> 19:08.714
Oh, no.

19:08.749 --> 19:10.883
We do things
the old fashioned way here.

19:10.918 --> 19:13.652
I just need your name,
an address and a phone number,

19:13.688 --> 19:15.756
and just a hundred dollars,
cash only.

19:15.791 --> 19:18.156
-Just to cover
the meal and drinks.

19:18.192 --> 19:21.059
Jeez, I don't even
know if I have 200 cash.
Baby, do you have any?

19:21.094 --> 19:23.468
-I know you were gonna
do some shopping.
-I guess so.

19:23.503 --> 19:27.539
No, I'm so sorry.
I mean a hundred dollars
for both of you.

19:27.575 --> 19:28.837
- Oh!

19:28.872 --> 19:29.902
Okay.

19:32.613 --> 19:33.609
- Ah.

19:40.282 --> 19:41.518
- Here you go.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.691
That seals the deal.

19:50.763 --> 19:51.963
Follow me.

19:51.998 --> 19:54.294
Let me show you to your room.

19:54.329 --> 19:59.269
Now, you best stick close to me
because Monroe Manor
has many twists and turns.

19:59.304 --> 20:02.569
It's easy to get lost
around here.

20:02.604 --> 20:04.272
It does seem
a little odd in here,

20:04.308 --> 20:07.046
but hey,
I love the architecture!

20:07.081 --> 20:09.345
It's his job.
He just made partner.

20:09.381 --> 20:12.450
Oh, congratulations!
That's great news.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.519
And how about you, Miss Jessie?

20:16.485 --> 20:18.720
Let me guess.
You're a model?

20:20.088 --> 20:21.225
Yeah.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.493
Hey, so that's a relic.
Is it original?

20:23.528 --> 20:24.857
I see all the kids
are wearing them these days?

20:24.893 --> 20:28.196
Oh yes, this was a present
from Mr. Monroe himself.

20:28.231 --> 20:30.532
It keeps excellent time.

20:33.002 --> 20:34.267
Well...

20:34.303 --> 20:35.968
Our chariot awaits.

21:02.032 --> 21:03.303
Here we are.

21:08.740 --> 21:12.207
I believe that you'll find
your stay here most rewarding.

21:12.242 --> 21:14.039
-Oh really?
-Mm-hmm.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.349
Aha! Here it is.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.379
Room 409.

21:19.414 --> 21:21.886
Our most romantic suite.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.787
Wow.

21:25.822 --> 21:28.692
Oh yes. It has the most lovely
view of the courthouse.

21:28.728 --> 21:30.292
Oh!

21:30.327 --> 21:32.563
Babe, look at this building.

21:33.395 --> 21:35.566
Jessie, it's a classic.

21:35.602 --> 21:39.898
- Oh, yes, yes, yes,
everything here is vintage.

21:39.933 --> 21:42.936
Oh come on, babe.
Look at the bright side.

21:43.404 --> 21:45.105
You love antiques.

21:46.940 --> 21:50.308
I hope this place
doesn't have black mold.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.316
Mm-hmm.

21:52.351 --> 21:54.348
- Oh,
let me have your phone.

21:54.383 --> 21:58.119
I better call Saratoga and
let them know we'll be there by,
what? 11 tomorrow?

21:58.155 --> 21:59.755
Yeah, good idea.

22:04.291 --> 22:07.263
<i>We're sorry,</i>
<i>all circuits are busy now.</i>

22:07.298 --> 22:10.367
All circuits are busy? What?

22:10.402 --> 22:13.303
I don't know,
maybe the weather's bad?

22:13.339 --> 22:15.101
Looks like there's
a storm brewing.

22:15.136 --> 22:19.103
Do feel free to stop by
the lobby before
you go to dinner.

22:19.139 --> 22:22.877
The restaurant can be
rather difficult to find.

22:24.784 --> 22:25.949
Okay.

22:25.985 --> 22:27.585
Thanks, Salim.

23:03.484 --> 23:04.886
- Babe?

23:04.922 --> 23:08.461
Can you bring me my shampoo?
I forgot it on the table.

23:17.398 --> 23:18.603
Found it!

23:28.144 --> 23:29.375
Um...

23:29.410 --> 23:30.846
It's locked.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.113
No, I left the door unlocked.

23:34.856 --> 23:36.350
What's going on?

23:36.385 --> 23:40.085
-Well, I don't know
what to tell you, it's locked.
-What's going on?

23:40.121 --> 23:42.858
David, what's going on?
Seriously. Open the door!

23:42.893 --> 23:46.230
Babe, just hold on for a second.
It might be jammed.

23:46.265 --> 23:48.127
David, open the fucking door!

23:52.971 --> 23:53.899
Ow!

23:53.935 --> 23:55.439
This better not be
one of your tricks,

23:55.474 --> 23:57.376
-David Bradley.
-No no! It wasn't me!

23:57.411 --> 23:59.078
You know I hate
being locked in anywhere.

23:59.113 --> 24:01.140
The door was jammed, I told you.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.211
I got your shampoo.

24:07.019 --> 24:08.081
- Hmm?

24:09.119 --> 24:10.248
Oh.

24:13.893 --> 24:14.926
Oh.

24:16.930 --> 24:18.327
- Oh.

24:18.362 --> 24:20.462
Hey, I've got an idea.

24:20.497 --> 24:23.602
How about I shampoo your hair?

25:26.694 --> 25:28.860
-- David?
-Hm?

25:28.895 --> 25:31.230
-Could you zip me up?
-Oh.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.001
With pleasure.

25:39.777 --> 25:42.311
-Come on. It's a mistake.

25:42.346 --> 25:44.012
You smell so good.

25:49.818 --> 25:52.350
Hmm, you look stunning tonight.

26:01.234 --> 26:02.866
Just wait till tonight.

26:54.388 --> 26:56.519
-Oh! Cheeky thing.

26:56.555 --> 26:59.257
-Oh. He's cute.

26:59.292 --> 27:01.259
This guy? Leroy Barnes?

27:03.291 --> 27:05.657
-- He's a lucky guy.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.599
One with me.

27:10.166 --> 27:12.335
-You don't even have service.
-Your camera works.

27:12.371 --> 27:13.439
I'll post it later.

27:13.474 --> 27:14.470
-I bet you will.

27:28.349 --> 27:31.423
Gotta get this chapter done.

27:31.459 --> 27:34.353
Oh, I need coffee.

27:39.431 --> 27:41.325
Fresh coffee.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.967
Oh, I gotta get this
chapter done tonight.

27:46.372 --> 27:47.404
-Oh!

27:49.573 --> 27:51.474
I've been expecting you.

27:51.510 --> 27:53.746
Come. We should get going.

27:53.781 --> 27:56.644
Chef Linda closes the kitchen
promptly at 9 O'clock.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.113
Yeah. You mentioned that.

28:01.823 --> 28:05.418
I imagine this was
once quite a uh,
a grand City Hall,

28:05.454 --> 28:08.660
and I guess the Monroe family
was very fortunate to obtain it.

28:08.696 --> 28:11.189
Oh, yes, yes.
They're a very wealthy family.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.665
They did their
best renovations here.

28:13.700 --> 28:16.295
Interesting. Oh, actually,
that reminds me,

28:16.331 --> 28:19.070
today we had a bit
of an incident in the bathroom.

28:19.106 --> 28:23.574
See, the door got jammed,
and uh, well,
Jessie got locked in.

28:23.610 --> 28:26.804
Oh. Oh, I'm--
I'm sorry. I'm...

28:26.840 --> 28:28.374
I'm so sorry.

28:28.942 --> 28:31.215
I will tell Mr. Monroe.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.845
Well, thank you.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.783
Yeah, Jessie normally never
locks the door, so it was
a little upsetting.

28:36.818 --> 28:38.153
If you know what I mean.

28:39.423 --> 28:40.952
No worries.

28:40.987 --> 28:44.123
Old doorways and locks,

28:44.159 --> 28:48.460
they tend to act out
when it gets damp.

28:50.165 --> 28:53.165
Oh, it's okay, Salim.
We worked it out.

28:53.201 --> 28:54.836
-- Hey Salim, wait up.
-- One.

28:54.872 --> 28:56.704
-- I have a question.
-Two.

28:56.739 --> 28:59.504
Three, four, five, six.

29:06.715 --> 29:08.216
Hot date, Salim?

29:08.651 --> 29:10.923
No. Not exactly.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.859
I just have to tend
to another visitor.
But please.

29:14.227 --> 29:15.322
Take a seat.

29:17.961 --> 29:20.294
-- Thank you.

29:22.597 --> 29:23.836
Well...

29:24.738 --> 29:26.872
Chef Linda will be
down in just a moment.

29:27.306 --> 29:28.302
Thank you.

29:33.613 --> 29:36.309
-I think he...

29:36.345 --> 29:39.879
What's with the plastic watch?
It's so annoying!

29:39.914 --> 29:41.920
I know. He's an odd one.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.122
Did I mention how beautiful
you look tonight?

29:59.834 --> 30:01.038
- Good time.

30:28.466 --> 30:31.232
So, this guy continues
to tell me for, like,
an hour about how

30:31.267 --> 30:33.873
Frank Lloyd Wright
is the greatest of all time.

30:36.071 --> 30:40.077
I said, " How could you say
that if you've never been
to Barcelona to see Galvany?"

30:41.273 --> 30:43.507
Good evening, I'm Chef Linda.

30:43.543 --> 30:46.114
Tonight's menu is prime rib and
baked potato,

30:46.149 --> 30:49.114
and pineapple upside down cake
for dessert.

30:49.149 --> 30:51.924
Oh, um. No, I'm a vegetarian.

30:55.892 --> 30:58.126
David! She just ignored me.

30:58.161 --> 31:00.460
I mean, I have barely eaten
anything today.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.199
I mean, I'm sure she heard you.

31:03.933 --> 31:06.301
It's okay. You won't starve.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.269
Are you saying I'm fat?

31:09.304 --> 31:11.202
You know I have to look good
for my blog.

31:11.237 --> 31:15.879
No, I'm just saying that
I'm sure she heard you and that
she'll bring you some food.

31:15.915 --> 31:19.714
So relax,
and enjoy this lovely room.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.926
Mmm, baby.

31:28.796 --> 31:32.129
It looks like you
have another admirer.

31:35.635 --> 31:37.928
God, David, don't be gross.

31:37.964 --> 31:42.136
Well, that's what you get
when you put yourself
on social media.

31:42.171 --> 31:44.339
Well,
you have a better suggestions?

31:45.372 --> 31:48.211
Yeah,
I could think of a few things.

31:52.849 --> 31:55.251
Yeah, I'd share wine--

31:57.484 --> 32:00.955
-Compliments of the house.
-Ahh! Thank you!

32:31.819 --> 32:33.025
Enjoy.

32:36.660 --> 32:40.492
With my deepest apologies
for being understaffed
this evening,

32:40.527 --> 32:43.332
and for that mishap
with the bathroom door.

32:44.933 --> 32:46.835
Eugene Monroe.

32:46.870 --> 32:48.403
Welcome to Monroe Manor.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.276
Yeah, thanks.

32:54.482 --> 32:55.608
We love this place.

33:00.815 --> 33:02.021
Well,

33:02.456 --> 33:04.182
enjoy your stay.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.970
Father Betancourt.

33:19.005 --> 33:21.434
Thanks for taking care
of our little lady.

33:29.683 --> 33:32.744
♪ Whispering in my ear ♪

33:43.297 --> 33:44.294
Not bad.

34:15.528 --> 34:16.788
Ow! Damn!

34:30.941 --> 34:32.540
God, this place sucks.

34:34.142 --> 34:35.477
It's just one night.

34:36.548 --> 34:37.881
Hey,

34:37.916 --> 34:39.415
I can share my steak with you.

34:39.450 --> 34:41.918
-Oh, God. No, no, no.
-- Just a little steak-ie?

34:41.953 --> 34:44.123
-- No?
-- Stop.

34:51.764 --> 34:53.094
- One, two, three.

35:02.706 --> 35:04.036
Three.

35:04.072 --> 35:06.343
One, two, three.

35:08.011 --> 35:12.148
Two, three, four, five.

35:12.184 --> 35:14.918
-Hey, you cheated!
-No, you're a liar!

35:14.953 --> 35:16.848
I saw you cheat! I hate you!

35:37.975 --> 35:39.673
God damn it, Linda!

35:45.148 --> 35:47.483
You forgot to serve dessert.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.063
Wait.

36:01.098 --> 36:02.828
Something's terribly off here.

36:04.001 --> 36:05.534
All the loops are off.

36:21.885 --> 36:23.315
Yummy time.

36:23.351 --> 36:25.785
I am sorry for the delay.

36:27.054 --> 36:31.389
Chef Linda, she always closes
the kitchen promptly at 9 p.m.

36:31.424 --> 36:33.164
Oh, where is the chef?

36:33.199 --> 36:35.226
I want to thank her
for my baked potato.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.466
- Jess!

36:38.869 --> 36:39.964
I'm sorry.

36:43.574 --> 36:46.708
-It has been such great service.
-- I know, right?

36:46.743 --> 36:49.908
You know what? Fuck it,
I'm not counting
calories tonight.

36:50.843 --> 36:53.282
Perhaps I can interest you
in some port.

36:53.317 --> 36:54.846
Would you be interested
in some port?

36:54.881 --> 36:58.851
We have some 1980s
vintage port from Portugal.

37:00.727 --> 37:02.888
Oh! More vintage.

37:04.429 --> 37:06.896
Thank-- thank-- thank you,
Salim. This is...

37:06.931 --> 37:08.025
This is delicious.

37:08.998 --> 37:09.994
Thank you.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.804
Have a good night.

37:14.871 --> 37:15.868
Cheers.

37:20.373 --> 37:22.047
Jess, come on.

37:22.082 --> 37:24.248
We'll have more fun tomorrow,
hmm?

37:24.283 --> 37:27.586
How about we, uh,
take some photos, eh?

37:27.621 --> 37:30.850
-Show you fans
how much fun you're having?

37:33.822 --> 37:37.329
The only good thing
about this place is the booze.

37:38.897 --> 37:40.299
You know what?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.467
This tastes pretty good.

37:44.770 --> 37:45.766
Try some.

37:48.036 --> 37:49.033
Come on.

37:51.206 --> 37:52.806
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

37:53.306 --> 37:54.472
Delicious.

37:56.817 --> 38:00.348
Oh. Vintage lights too?

38:00.383 --> 38:02.719
-- How charming.
-Now what?

38:02.755 --> 38:04.089
No power?

38:04.124 --> 38:07.488
Oh, come one, David.
It's romantic.

38:07.523 --> 38:10.323
Did you plan this all
for a reason?

38:10.358 --> 38:12.793
Huh? No. No. This sucks.

38:18.732 --> 38:20.966
He must not have stayed
for dessert.

38:21.939 --> 38:23.941
What? Who?

38:23.976 --> 38:25.575
The cowboy and his pony.

38:27.145 --> 38:29.711
God, you're so disgusting.

38:29.979 --> 38:30.976
Hey,

38:31.878 --> 38:34.650
I'm sorry I dragged you here.
I mean...

38:35.615 --> 38:37.389
you deserve better than this.

38:39.392 --> 38:41.888
David, I know I'm being a bitch,
but I just...

38:42.754 --> 38:45.661
you know what look, I'm sorry.

38:45.697 --> 38:48.733
I know you're trying to make
the best of the situation.

38:48.769 --> 38:49.896
That's my girl.

38:55.635 --> 38:59.376
I am sorry to break the mood,

38:59.411 --> 39:01.677
but we have the elevator running
right now.

39:01.712 --> 39:04.248
But I don't know how long
the generator will last,

39:04.283 --> 39:05.945
so I'll have to ask you
to follow me.

39:07.786 --> 39:08.612
Now.

39:33.209 --> 39:35.579
Oh, my God. David!

39:36.111 --> 39:37.645
Hurry.

39:37.681 --> 39:40.848
-- The kids! They're dead!
-Hey, hey. What?

39:43.319 --> 39:44.787
- What's wrong?

39:44.822 --> 39:46.150
- Miss. Jessie, please,
calm down. There's nobody here.

39:46.185 --> 39:48.153
My children went to bed
when you were having dinner.

39:48.188 --> 39:50.924
Yeah, Salim's right.
There's no one in there.
It's okay.

39:51.991 --> 39:54.725
- Your kids are here?
Isn't it late?

39:54.760 --> 39:57.529
Yes, well, we've lived here...

39:57.565 --> 39:59.564
since my wife passed away.

40:01.534 --> 40:02.903
I'm so sorry.

40:04.671 --> 40:06.506
- Too much port, huh?

40:06.542 --> 40:09.041
No, no. I saw them. I saw them.

40:10.449 --> 40:11.878
- I think she just needs
some sleep.

40:11.913 --> 40:15.520
Yes, we must hurry.
We must hurry. Come, come.

40:18.853 --> 40:20.888
-- Grab her bag.
-- Yes, yes.

40:30.298 --> 40:31.503
Go to sleep.

41:41.039 --> 41:44.237
-- I'm not going to the prom
dressed like a--

41:44.272 --> 41:46.772
-- <i> I hate you!</i>
-- <i> Watch you mouth,</i>
<i>young lady.</i>

41:46.807 --> 41:49.276
-- No! No!

41:52.046 --> 41:56.383
Oh, um,
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,
but...

41:56.418 --> 41:58.049
We have a problem.

41:58.084 --> 42:00.856
-All the loops are off.
-That's your fault.

42:01.491 --> 42:03.694
I told you just the girl.

42:03.730 --> 42:07.729
But...
I thought you said you wanted
both of them.

42:07.765 --> 42:10.729
-Eugene, what about my children?
-It's too late.

42:10.764 --> 42:13.331
You have empowered the demon.

42:13.366 --> 42:16.668
Now, we've got to work fast
before all hell breaks loose.

42:26.283 --> 42:27.751
What have I done?

42:47.940 --> 42:48.937
Jessie?

43:09.760 --> 43:12.631
Gotta get this done.
Gotta get this done.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.302
Gotta get this chapter done.

43:23.373 --> 43:25.006
I need coffee.

45:10.679 --> 45:12.278
I'll see you in hell.

45:41.711 --> 45:44.046
What the fuck? Ahhh, God!

45:45.616 --> 45:48.449
What the fuck? What is this?

45:48.485 --> 45:49.747
Get the fuck--

45:49.783 --> 45:51.350
Get the fuck--

45:53.158 --> 45:54.287
Jessie!

45:55.061 --> 45:56.058
Jessie.

45:56.326 --> 45:57.424
Fuck.

45:57.459 --> 45:58.489
Jessie!

46:00.463 --> 46:02.229
Oh, my God!

46:02.563 --> 46:03.726
Fuck!

46:03.762 --> 46:04.968
Oh!

46:05.999 --> 46:07.498
Baby, we gotta get outta here.

46:08.804 --> 46:10.974
I'm serious. We have to leave.

46:11.506 --> 46:12.503
Now.

46:14.608 --> 46:15.643
Jessie?

46:20.479 --> 46:23.855
Jessie?
I'm serious, we have to go.
Baby?

46:25.256 --> 46:26.291
Fuck.

46:37.763 --> 46:38.969
Baby?

46:39.633 --> 46:40.839
Wake up!

46:41.140 --> 46:42.137
Jess!

46:44.073 --> 46:46.075
All right,
I'll be back in a minute, okay?

46:48.206 --> 46:50.013
-Oh, fuck!

46:50.480 --> 46:52.213
God! Jess!

46:55.814 --> 46:57.113
Okay.

46:57.149 --> 46:58.785
What the hell is going on?

47:02.722 --> 47:03.928
Salim?

47:09.795 --> 47:11.034
Salim!

47:12.732 --> 47:13.971
Salim!

47:15.805 --> 47:18.442
Salim, We got a problem here!

47:23.411 --> 47:27.083
Hey! Your showers are spitting
out black shit, man!

47:28.682 --> 47:29.888
Salim?

47:31.885 --> 47:33.452
What the fuck?

47:38.296 --> 47:39.156
Salim?

47:47.569 --> 47:49.474
Oh, God!

47:55.447 --> 47:57.047
You... you okay?

47:59.152 --> 48:00.149
Fuck.

48:02.749 --> 48:03.955
Salim!

48:05.554 --> 48:06.854
Fuck!

48:27.380 --> 48:28.507
Oh, God. Oh, God.

48:29.779 --> 48:31.879
Hey. Hey old man, um,

48:31.914 --> 48:33.950
have you seen Salim around?

48:33.986 --> 48:38.388
Because uh, uh, Linda,
Linda the Chef, um...

48:38.424 --> 48:42.558
I was just in the kitchen
and she was lying
on the ground, and...

48:42.593 --> 48:44.424
she-- she's dead!

48:45.690 --> 48:48.230
You hear what I'm saying?
She's fucking dead!

48:55.408 --> 48:56.403
All right, well...

48:57.405 --> 49:00.242
I don't normally drink
this stuff, but I'm...

49:00.777 --> 49:02.272
I'll be honest with you,

49:02.307 --> 49:04.312
I'm having a bit of a bad night.

49:09.351 --> 49:13.324
I mean, my fiance,
she's all pissed off at me.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.328
There's this... this black goo
that keeps shooting out
of the shower.

49:17.364 --> 49:20.725
I mean what the fuck
is the deal with all
the black goo around here?

49:20.760 --> 49:23.694
Were you listening
when I told you
that the chef is dead?

49:25.505 --> 49:26.499
- I'm listenin'.

49:27.970 --> 49:30.437
Take care of your little lady.

49:37.877 --> 49:39.083
Jesus.

49:40.445 --> 49:42.350
No thanks for your help, buddy.

49:44.653 --> 49:48.587
I guess you stay here
long enough,
you become an alcoholic.

49:49.958 --> 49:51.656
-Salim?

49:52.928 --> 49:54.428
Salim, is that you?

49:56.197 --> 49:59.169
Fuck you, Salim. Just fuck you!

50:09.277 --> 50:12.083
Damn!
Nothing in this place works!

50:47.850 --> 50:49.549
David! Salim!

50:50.183 --> 50:52.090
Open the damn door!

51:02.500 --> 51:03.497
Shit.

51:14.814 --> 51:16.873
Thank you. Thank you very much.

51:18.078 --> 51:19.315
Soon as I saw it,

51:20.149 --> 51:22.153
I knew she was something
special.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.442
I didn't expect to see you here.

51:50.012 --> 51:51.178
How can I help you?

51:51.214 --> 51:54.080
Who was that?
He gave you money?

51:54.115 --> 51:58.289
It was a-- a tow truck driver
that I-- I-- I hired to get rid
of the evidence.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.324
-He called me earlier.
-Really?
Why did you sell the car?

52:02.392 --> 52:05.394
Well, I thought that if we were
using the owners

52:05.429 --> 52:09.193
to help get my children's souls
back, then we could--

52:09.228 --> 52:10.861
Give me the cash.

52:13.905 --> 52:15.899
We've got bigger problems. Look.

52:17.235 --> 52:18.842
- What?

52:18.877 --> 52:20.205
How is this possible? Wait.

52:20.240 --> 52:22.312
Wait. Let me rewind it.

52:24.882 --> 52:28.411
- I locked David
and Jessie in their room.
We'll deal with them later.

52:37.289 --> 52:39.261
- <i> Salim?</i>

52:39.296 --> 52:41.665
-He's out.
-- <i> Salim, is that you?</i>

52:41.700 --> 52:42.731
That's impossible.

52:44.470 --> 52:45.566
Humming?

52:47.639 --> 52:48.635
Find him.

52:49.434 --> 52:50.673
I'm getting Jessie.

53:05.658 --> 53:06.653
- Salim?

53:08.792 --> 53:09.887
Is that you?

53:19.266 --> 53:20.469
- Who are you?

53:32.146 --> 53:33.245
Are you okay?

53:43.192 --> 53:45.824
Come play with us, David.

53:56.667 --> 54:00.043
-Who's that?
-Just me, Rohan.

54:00.079 --> 54:02.443
-Salim's dead son.
-- And me.

54:02.479 --> 54:05.849
Dev. Don't you wanna come
and play with us?

54:05.884 --> 54:07.945
Emma likes to play too.

54:11.249 --> 54:12.521
David.

54:18.996 --> 54:20.993
Thank God you're here!

54:21.028 --> 54:23.294
David's missing
and there's black shit
all over the bathroom.

54:23.329 --> 54:27.503
Now, now, Miss Jessie.
This is an old hotel,
we don't get many guests.

54:28.501 --> 54:30.569
That's just rust from old pipes.

54:30.605 --> 54:33.038
Yeah, no,
rust is not black and gross!

54:33.073 --> 54:37.514
Don't be worried, all right?
Why don't you and I look
for David.

54:37.549 --> 54:40.217
I have a flashlight.
The halls are dim
from the storm.

54:40.252 --> 54:42.416
-- <i> Help!</i>
-Wait, did you hear that?

54:42.451 --> 54:44.520
That's David!
Come on we have to go!

54:47.320 --> 54:48.590
- Help me.

54:49.056 --> 54:51.087
Help me.

54:52.158 --> 54:53.191
Help.

54:53.227 --> 54:55.399
She killed us.

54:55.966 --> 54:56.961
- Jessie!

54:58.329 --> 54:59.364
Jess.

55:02.038 --> 55:05.673
Help! Help! Help!

55:06.975 --> 55:08.071
Help!

55:14.246 --> 55:15.279
Jessie!

55:18.989 --> 55:19.984
- Jessie!

55:20.586 --> 55:22.624
Jessie, I really need you!

55:33.936 --> 55:34.972
Help me.

56:31.758 --> 56:33.629
Shit.
I don't have the time for this.

56:43.271 --> 56:45.173
Come on, Salim.

56:45.209 --> 56:47.071
Answer the God damn phone!

56:53.645 --> 56:54.848
Where the fuck are you?

56:57.954 --> 56:59.287
Uh...

57:06.831 --> 57:07.828
Come on.

57:11.501 --> 57:15.432
No. No, no! No, Thomas,
don't do that!

57:30.285 --> 57:32.054
I need coffee.

57:32.089 --> 57:33.249
What is going on?

58:01.315 --> 58:02.520
- Hmm.

58:08.322 --> 58:09.527
- Hmm.

58:11.497 --> 58:13.426
-- Hmm.
All right, take it easy.

58:29.377 --> 58:30.746
- Ah, okay.

58:31.817 --> 58:32.814
Okay.

58:33.578 --> 58:34.783
All right.

1:00:33.969 --> 1:00:38.676
You must smell it.
It's magical. It's pachouli.

1:00:40.046 --> 1:00:41.041
It's magical.

1:00:52.091 --> 1:00:53.152
Oh, hey Salim!

1:01:00.763 --> 1:01:03.066
What the fuck is going on here,
man?

1:01:03.102 --> 1:01:06.863
You see me covered
in this black goo
from your lousy showers? Huh?

1:01:06.899 --> 1:01:09.002
Or what about Chef Linda?

1:01:09.038 --> 1:01:11.538
She's dead! Up in the kitchen!
Did you know that?

1:01:11.573 --> 1:01:13.008
Or what about Thomas?

1:01:13.043 --> 1:01:15.476
Thomas, the guy that likes
to hang himself in front of me!

1:01:15.511 --> 1:01:17.280
-Hands up, chap.
-Whoa.

1:01:17.316 --> 1:01:18.614
I owe you no explanation.

1:01:18.649 --> 1:01:20.718
-Okay.
-You signed the guest register.

1:01:21.318 --> 1:01:22.313
What the fuck?

1:01:24.287 --> 1:01:25.617
Here ya go.

1:01:25.653 --> 1:01:26.988
That seals the deal.

1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:30.057
No.

1:01:32.296 --> 1:01:33.561
You're crazy.

1:01:33.596 --> 1:01:35.364
Aren't we all a little insane?

1:02:08.630 --> 1:02:10.463
I wanna fix your hair.

1:02:10.499 --> 1:02:12.165
Don't touch me!

1:02:12.765 --> 1:02:13.969
Where's David?

1:02:14.370 --> 1:02:16.503
David! Help!

1:02:16.538 --> 1:02:19.502
Help me! Help me!

1:02:20.408 --> 1:02:21.440
David?

1:02:21.475 --> 1:02:22.841
David?

1:02:22.876 --> 1:02:25.310
David?
Oh, he's not here!

1:02:26.750 --> 1:02:28.918
You won't be seeing
David anymore.

1:02:53.278 --> 1:02:55.813
What now? Salim!

1:03:15.529 --> 1:03:16.526
Jessie?

1:03:20.505 --> 1:03:24.171
Baby. Baby, we...

1:03:26.711 --> 1:03:29.506
We gotta get outta here.
Baby. Wake up!

1:03:30.815 --> 1:03:33.345
We have to get out of here.
You hear me?

1:03:39.258 --> 1:03:42.825
Hey. I love you.

1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:45.060
And I know this trip
hasn't gone to plan.

1:03:46.062 --> 1:03:48.327
But I promise I'll make it up
to you, okay?

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:52.397
Baby?

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:57.237
Jessie?

1:04:02.281 --> 1:04:04.046
What the fuck?

1:04:07.814 --> 1:04:10.613
What the fuck?

1:04:12.887 --> 1:04:14.617
Jessie, weren't you just--

1:04:17.427 --> 1:04:19.723
Jess! Fuck!

1:04:30.034 --> 1:04:31.403
I'm sorry, Thomas.

1:04:32.510 --> 1:04:33.570
You're on your own now.

1:04:53.928 --> 1:04:56.397
What the hell are you wearing?

1:04:56.432 --> 1:04:57.429
What?

1:04:59.004 --> 1:05:01.168
You're not going to the prom
dressed like a tramp?

1:05:01.204 --> 1:05:05.434
What? Do you want me
to wear my communion dress?

1:05:05.470 --> 1:05:09.378
I'm 18. You don't own me!
I hate you!

1:05:09.414 --> 1:05:12.977
Watch your mouth, young lady!
That's not the dress I bought
for you!

1:05:13.012 --> 1:05:15.083
Take a chill pill, Mom!

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:18.251
Everyone will laugh at me
if I wear that thing!

1:05:18.287 --> 1:05:21.852
Well, if you're not changing,
you're not going!

1:05:21.888 --> 1:05:24.061
No! No! No! No!

1:05:24.096 --> 1:05:27.426
I'm not going to the prom
dressed like an old spinster!

1:05:43.910 --> 1:05:45.477
No! Emma! No!

1:06:05.265 --> 1:06:07.499
What the fuck is going on here,
Eugene?

1:06:08.473 --> 1:06:09.600
Where's Jessie?

1:06:10.601 --> 1:06:13.543
And who is this crazy girl
following me?

1:06:13.579 --> 1:06:15.276
It's my twin sister, Emma.

1:06:21.918 --> 1:06:26.617
Bring him to the Lobby. Please.

1:06:39.766 --> 1:06:40.763
Eugene?

1:06:42.203 --> 1:06:44.503
I have him here. Eugene?
Where are you?

1:06:48.577 --> 1:06:50.075
Eugene?

1:06:50.111 --> 1:06:53.182
-Eugene? Eugene?

1:06:56.987 --> 1:06:59.419
What the fuck did you do with
Jessie?

1:07:08.328 --> 1:07:10.529
I hope that idiot
didn't kill him.

1:07:16.939 --> 1:07:19.538
Fuck! You fucking shot me!

1:07:26.046 --> 1:07:29.119
What the fuck?

1:07:29.619 --> 1:07:31.253
God damn!

1:07:33.221 --> 1:07:36.357
Fuck! What the fuck
is your problem?

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:40.757
Eugene?

1:07:45.362 --> 1:07:48.204
Good. He's not dead yet.

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:51.501
David, if you ever want to see
Jessie again,

1:07:51.537 --> 1:07:54.573
I suggest you drag yourself
over here.

1:07:55.781 --> 1:07:57.840
What is this?
What's going on?

1:07:59.311 --> 1:08:01.250
This is my private space.

1:08:02.552 --> 1:08:06.222
You think Betancourt could keep
Emma controlled with just drugs?

1:08:07.559 --> 1:08:08.719
He had help...

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:11.157
From me.

1:08:11.193 --> 1:08:13.356
Where's Jessie?
I need to see her.

1:08:13.391 --> 1:08:15.264
Keep the gun on him, Salim.

1:08:16.568 --> 1:08:18.135
He's a strong one.

1:08:19.732 --> 1:08:23.140
-Jessie...
-Shut up! This will be over soon
enough.

1:08:31.076 --> 1:08:32.712
Move! Move!

1:08:32.748 --> 1:08:33.843
All right!

1:08:57.402 --> 1:08:59.141
What are you doing down here?

1:08:59.176 --> 1:09:02.270
-It smells like death.
-None of your business.

1:09:02.306 --> 1:09:04.012
Now, tie him up.

1:09:04.048 --> 1:09:07.342
No! No!
He's bleeding!

1:09:07.377 --> 1:09:08.845
Will you shut up?

1:09:12.149 --> 1:09:15.622
Don't you understand
you're making things
worse for yourself?

1:09:15.657 --> 1:09:19.427
That the demon inside of Emma
gets stronger with anger.

1:09:19.462 --> 1:09:22.397
It will kill you in a heartbeat
and suck out your soul.

1:09:31.675 --> 1:09:32.902
Ah, fuck!

1:09:34.744 --> 1:09:36.609
Hey. Jessie!

1:09:38.075 --> 1:09:43.244
Fuck man. It's gonna be okay.
I-- I got it under control.

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:44.749
Ow! Okay.

1:10:14.247 --> 1:10:16.283
Oh poor Betancourt.

1:10:16.318 --> 1:10:18.717
I'm gonna miss
these excellent powders.

1:10:28.934 --> 1:10:31.730
What is your problem, princess?

1:10:32.530 --> 1:10:34.733
Don't you want eternal life?

1:10:35.134 --> 1:10:36.565
It's simple.

1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:38.768
See, I give you to the beast.

1:10:38.803 --> 1:10:42.104
And he gives me back
my precious sister.

1:10:42.139 --> 1:10:47.981
Now we get out of this hotel
and you get to stay... Forever!

1:10:58.356 --> 1:11:00.363
It's not that bad!

1:11:01.826 --> 1:11:04.763
It's really not.
It's really not that bad!

1:11:45.206 --> 1:11:46.409
What about my children?

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:49.342
What about Rohan and Dev?

1:11:49.378 --> 1:11:51.214
I only brought these two
down here

1:11:51.249 --> 1:11:54.016
so you could sacrifice them
for my children.

1:11:54.051 --> 1:11:56.452
Your children are dead, Salim.

1:11:57.152 --> 1:11:58.515
You're a fool, Salim.

1:11:58.550 --> 1:12:00.984
This has always been about Emma.

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:04.260
You promised me!

1:12:04.296 --> 1:12:07.659
I stayed here
and managed these dead souls!

1:12:07.694 --> 1:12:10.467
Relived their lives
over and over again!

1:12:10.502 --> 1:12:14.331
I've had to watch
my own children die,
day after day!

1:12:14.366 --> 1:12:17.902
And now you're telling me
there is no demon,
there's just your sister?

1:12:18.941 --> 1:12:19.976
You owe me!

1:13:36.488 --> 1:13:39.086
-Stop, Eugene!
You can't do this!

1:13:42.090 --> 1:13:43.526
Come, Daddy!

1:13:47.965 --> 1:13:49.125
We're happy here!

1:13:53.269 --> 1:13:55.838
Come play with us forever!

1:13:58.076 --> 1:14:00.972
No! You've wasted 30 years!

1:14:26.331 --> 1:14:27.603
Emma!

1:14:29.567 --> 1:14:31.101
Sweet little Emma.

1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:36.040
Forever a child.

1:14:38.213 --> 1:14:39.846
Please forgive me.

1:14:41.446 --> 1:14:42.849
I love you!

1:15:07.812 --> 1:15:08.809
Die!

1:15:49.048 --> 1:15:54.821
Jessie. Jessie!
You gotta get outta here, baby!

1:15:54.857 --> 1:15:56.989
I'm gonna find help, okay?
It's going to be okay.

1:15:57.994 --> 1:15:59.759
Baby--

1:15:59.795 --> 1:16:01.827
I don't think
I'm gonna make it outta here.

1:16:01.862 --> 1:16:04.562
No, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1:16:04.597 --> 1:16:06.897
I love you.

1:16:06.932 --> 1:16:09.265
I love you too!
Look, I love you too.

1:16:12.738 --> 1:16:17.310
Take my phone, so maybe...

1:16:17.345 --> 1:16:20.249
-maybe it will work
and you can get help.
-I'm gonna get some help.

1:16:20.284 --> 1:16:21.916
You's gonna be okay, right?

1:16:21.951 --> 1:16:24.253
I'm gonna get help, okay?
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1:16:24.288 --> 1:16:25.688
You're gonna be okay, yeah?

1:16:27.454 --> 1:16:28.889
Goodbye, baby.

1:17:01.654 --> 1:17:04.925
<i>The number you've reached-</i>
-Oh, you're freakin' useless!

1:17:08.526 --> 1:17:09.759
Help!

1:17:09.794 --> 1:17:11.734
Where's my car? Shit!

1:17:31.750 --> 1:17:33.116
It's going to be okay?

1:17:33.151 --> 1:17:36.418
I'll be back soon, okay?
I gotta find help.

1:17:44.500 --> 1:17:48.100
Wait! Stop! Please help! Stop!

1:17:53.971 --> 1:17:55.843
Thank you. I need your help.

1:17:55.878 --> 1:17:57.841
Do you have a phone?
I need to call the police.

1:17:57.877 --> 1:18:02.077
I hope you're not one of those
drunk college students that
throws up in my back seat.

1:18:02.113 --> 1:18:05.012
You puke,
it's a $100 cash fee.

1:18:05.048 --> 1:18:07.151
No, no, no! I'm not drunk.

1:18:07.187 --> 1:18:10.086
I need the police!
My boyfriend has just been shot!

1:18:10.121 --> 1:18:11.957
Well, I don't have my phone
with me,

1:18:11.992 --> 1:18:13.895
but I can take you
to the police station.

1:18:15.792 --> 1:18:17.833
You okay?

1:18:19.769 --> 1:18:23.299
You look like
someone tried to hurt you.

1:18:23.334 --> 1:18:26.908
Please, just take me
to the police station. Go!

1:18:27.874 --> 1:18:30.142
Jeez. Just trying to be polite.

1:18:41.021 --> 1:18:43.519
Wait. wait.
Do you have to go down there?

1:18:43.555 --> 1:18:44.761
Yes.

1:18:47.364 --> 1:18:48.424
Where did you get that?

1:18:49.730 --> 1:18:52.032
That was in my car!
Hey!

1:18:53.698 --> 1:18:55.035
Your car?

1:18:55.070 --> 1:18:58.236
-What the hell is going on?
-Why?

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:02.537
Wanna take a selfie, Jessie?

1:19:03.114 --> 1:19:04.242
Oh, my...

1:19:05.710 --> 1:19:07.113
Oh, my God!

1:19:12.590 --> 1:19:15.858
Oh! So now you wanna play hard
to get?

1:19:17.592 --> 1:19:19.455
This is gonna be fun.

1:19:24.731 --> 1:19:26.198
Look at that girl run!

1:19:27.264 --> 1:19:29.806
Good thing I got
my runnin' boots on!

1:19:31.409 --> 1:19:33.139
I'm coming for you, Jessie!

1:19:49.423 --> 1:19:50.893
Asshole!

1:19:52.395 --> 1:19:53.390
- David?

1:19:54.630 --> 1:19:56.563
David! Where are you?

1:19:58.633 --> 1:20:00.133
Where you going, Jessie?

1:20:02.167 --> 1:20:04.401
Wanna play hide and seek,
do you?

1:20:06.741 --> 1:20:09.106
- David, where are you?

1:20:09.142 --> 1:20:11.980
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1:20:19.719 --> 1:20:21.187
Damnit, Jessie!

1:20:22.053 --> 1:20:23.992
Why are you such a bitch?

1:21:01.764 --> 1:21:03.966
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

1:21:15.839 --> 1:21:17.045
David!

1:21:27.257 --> 1:21:28.254
David?

1:21:30.890 --> 1:21:32.159
What are you doing here?

1:21:33.791 --> 1:21:35.030
Wait.

1:22:03.092 --> 1:22:06.490
-David? David!
-- I'm up here at the bar!

1:22:07.562 --> 1:22:08.690
Oh, my God.

1:22:10.999 --> 1:22:13.233
David. I can't believe
I found you!

1:22:16.505 --> 1:22:17.567
I love you.

1:22:19.808 --> 1:22:21.208
Okay come on, we have to go.

1:22:24.949 --> 1:22:28.017
You don't look so good.
Come on, let's sit down.

1:22:35.086 --> 1:22:37.290
Let's make a toast, hmm?

1:22:37.857 --> 1:22:39.020
To our victory.

1:22:42.893 --> 1:22:44.099
Cheers.

1:22:45.762 --> 1:22:47.868
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to drink up?

1:22:47.904 --> 1:22:49.068
Come on.
Up, up, up, drink, drink!

1:22:49.103 --> 1:22:52.439
No! No! I'm not
in the mood for whiskey!

1:22:52.475 --> 1:22:55.770
I mean you have no idea
what I've been through
since I left for help!

1:22:55.805 --> 1:22:58.507
That stalker guy from the
antique store stole my car

1:22:58.542 --> 1:23:01.846
and took that creepy furry thing
with him.

1:23:01.881 --> 1:23:05.182
I mean, he picked me up
in a fake taxi and is in here
trying to hurt me.

1:23:05.218 --> 1:23:08.089
Didn't you hear him?
He's crazy!

1:23:08.125 --> 1:23:11.118
No, I'm sorry. I can't say
that I heard anything.

1:23:11.154 --> 1:23:14.856
I've been a little busy myself,
dealing with dead kids
tormenting me,

1:23:14.891 --> 1:23:18.529
and that dead guy Thomas,
he hangs himself
in front of me,

1:23:18.564 --> 1:23:23.369
and then I crawl to the elevator
and back to our room.

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.111
I'm sorry but I...
oh no no no...

1:23:32.450 --> 1:23:33.643
There you are.

1:23:40.458 --> 1:23:42.224
And who's this?

1:23:42.259 --> 1:23:45.721
I thought you said that your
boyfriend was shot and dying?

1:23:47.258 --> 1:23:49.230
Did you lie to me, Jessie?

1:23:52.201 --> 1:23:54.866
Or is he one of the dead bodies
in the basement?

1:23:54.901 --> 1:23:57.799
Now, now. Be nice.

1:23:59.405 --> 1:24:02.640
I was shot,
but I'm feeling much better now.

1:24:02.675 --> 1:24:07.116
I think Jessie just over-reacted
when she saw so much blood.

1:24:07.151 --> 1:24:09.952
Jessie, Jessie, how many times
do I have to tell you

1:24:09.987 --> 1:24:13.718
the dangers of
too much online exposure?

1:24:13.753 --> 1:24:14.750
David!

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:20.492
No more exposure
when I'm through with you.

1:24:21.092 --> 1:24:22.626
Apologize to her!

1:24:26.834 --> 1:24:27.933
Now.

1:24:36.573 --> 1:24:39.344
I'm really sorry.
I love Jessie.

1:24:39.379 --> 1:24:42.348
I think she's so pretty.
And smart and funny.

1:24:42.384 --> 1:24:44.350
And she was nice to me
when I was a total creep.

1:24:44.386 --> 1:24:46.317
I'm really sorry,
it was a huge misunderstanding.

1:24:46.352 --> 1:24:48.289
-I won't do it again.
-Shh. It's okay.

1:24:52.090 --> 1:24:53.294
I'm sorry, Jessie.

1:25:06.809 --> 1:25:08.474
What's wrong, Jessie?

1:25:10.143 --> 1:25:13.177
I thought that you loved me.

1:25:13.212 --> 1:25:15.349
I was gonna propose to you.

1:25:17.887 --> 1:25:19.749
But when I got back to our room,

1:25:21.350 --> 1:25:22.752
the ring was gone.

1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:27.889
Any idea where it went?

1:25:28.832 --> 1:25:31.667
No, David. I have no clue.

1:25:31.702 --> 1:25:33.330
What's wrong with you?

1:25:33.366 --> 1:25:34.896
"What's wrong with you?"

1:25:36.837 --> 1:25:38.001
Stop, David!

1:25:41.308 --> 1:25:44.345
Come here, Jessie.
Come here, Jessie.

1:25:45.244 --> 1:25:46.578
Come here, Jessie.

1:25:48.883 --> 1:25:49.878
Stay with me.

1:25:51.447 --> 1:25:55.389
And we can live.
Here!

1:25:57.692 --> 1:25:58.788
Forever.

1:26:00.057 --> 1:26:01.263
Hmm?

1:26:02.158 --> 1:26:03.397
Hmm?

1:26:22.346 --> 1:26:25.617
David. I'm so sorry.

1:26:28.723 --> 1:26:29.755
David.

1:26:43.103 --> 1:26:46.242
David. I'm so sorry...
