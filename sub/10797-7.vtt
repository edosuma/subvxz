00:01.834 --> 00:05.917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.834 --> 00:05.917
<i>Stardate 41255.6:</i>

00:05.917 --> 00:08.333
<i>After delivering a party</i>

00:05.917 --> 00:08.333
<i>of Earth colonists</i>

00:08.333 --> 00:10.125
<i>to the Strnad solar system,</i>

00:10.125 --> 00:12.458
<i>we have discovered</i>

00:10.125 --> 00:12.458
<i>another class M planet</i>

00:12.458 --> 00:14.750
<i>in the adjoining</i>

00:12.458 --> 00:14.750
<i>Rubicun star system.</i>

00:14.750 --> 00:16.500
<i>We are now in orbit there</i>

00:16.500 --> 00:18.250
<i>having determined it</i>

00:16.500 --> 00:18.250
<i>to be inhabited</i>

00:18.250 --> 00:20.375
<i>as well as unusually lovely.</i>

00:20.375 --> 00:23.709
<i>My first officer has taken an</i>

00:20.375 --> 00:23.709
<i>away team down to make contact</i>

00:23.709 --> 00:26.625
<i>and they are in the process</i>

00:23.709 --> 00:26.625
<i>of returning to the ship.</i>

00:26.625 --> 00:28.583
Riker says

00:26.625 --> 00:28.583
the planet's life-forms

00:28.583 --> 00:29.917
are almost identical to us.

00:29.917 --> 00:31.458
He's very enthusiastic.

00:31.458 --> 00:34.000
Captain...

00:31.458 --> 00:34.000
sorry, Troi.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.417
The Doctor has something very

00:34.000 --> 00:37.417
important to tell you, Captain.

00:37.417 --> 00:39.333
You've been talking

00:37.417 --> 00:39.333
about it for days--

00:39.333 --> 00:41.208
shore leave for the crew.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.500
Establishing this colony

00:41.208 --> 00:43.500
has been exhausting

00:43.500 --> 00:46.083
for the entire

00:43.500 --> 00:46.083
crew, Captain.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.834
We're not a supply vessel.

00:47.834 --> 00:50.709
Settling all those people

00:47.834 --> 00:50.709
has been a strain on everyone.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.834
I'm tired myself.

00:55.917 --> 00:58.291
Is it as good as your

00:55.917 --> 00:58.291
report suggests, Number One?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.750
As per report, sir.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.583
Class M--

00:59.750 --> 01:02.583
earthlike, beautiful.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.250
It will startle you.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.667
Sounds wonderful

01:04.250 --> 01:05.667
for the children.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.792
The holodecks are

01:05.667 --> 01:07.792
marvelous, of course,

01:07.792 --> 01:10.041
but there's nothing

01:07.792 --> 01:10.041
like open spaces

01:10.041 --> 01:11.875
and fresh air.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.709
I've listed my report on

01:11.875 --> 01:15.709
their customs and laws, sir.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.750
Fairly simple--

01:15.709 --> 01:17.750
common sense things.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.166
LA FORGE:

01:17.750 --> 01:19.166
They're wild in some ways

01:19.166 --> 01:20.667
actually puritanical

01:19.166 --> 01:20.667
in others.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.917
Neat as pins, ultra-lawful.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.667
They make love

01:22.917 --> 01:25.667
at the drop of a hat.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.792
Any hat.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.875
But the happiest report

01:30.500 --> 01:32.875
has its negatives.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.542
Let's start with them,

01:32.875 --> 01:34.542
Number One.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.875
There are none, sir--

01:34.542 --> 01:36.875
none that any of us could find.

01:36.875 --> 01:38.875
But there is

01:36.875 --> 01:38.875
a problem here, sir.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.959
It's the faulty reading

01:38.875 --> 01:40.959
I reported, sir.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.500
I'm reading something

01:40.959 --> 01:43.500
off the starboard bow

01:43.500 --> 01:46.291
but there is

01:43.500 --> 01:46.291
nothing there.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.917
Sensor technicians

01:48.458 --> 01:50.917
are working on it, sir.

01:50.917 --> 01:53.458
They have identified it

01:50.917 --> 01:53.458
as a glitch in the system.

01:55.667 --> 01:59.208
I take it you find no glitch

01:55.667 --> 01:59.208
at all in this planet, however.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.041
No, sir.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.667
If you approve

02:01.041 --> 02:02.667
shore leave, sir,

02:02.667 --> 02:04.458
we could start

02:02.667 --> 02:04.458
with a small group.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.875
Of course.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.166
Wesley, if we go down,

02:08.166 --> 02:10.333
I'd like you

02:08.166 --> 02:10.333
to join the away team

02:10.333 --> 02:11.959
to evaluate this planet

02:11.959 --> 02:13.834
as a place for young

02:11.959 --> 02:13.834
people to relax.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.750
Yes, sir.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.417
If our scans and observations

02:15.750 --> 02:18.417
confirm the report,

02:18.417 --> 02:20.542
of course I'll approve it.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.291
Let's just hope it's not

02:23.000 --> 02:26.291
too good to be true.

02:47.625 --> 02:52.041
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

02:52.041 --> 02:56.417
<i>These are the voyages</i>

02:52.041 --> 02:56.417
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

02:58.291 --> 03:01.792
<i>to explore</i>

02:58.291 --> 03:01.792
<i>strange new worlds</i>

03:01.792 --> 03:06.500
<i>to seek out new life</i>

03:01.792 --> 03:06.500
<i>and new civilizations</i>

03:06.500 --> 03:10.375
<i>to boldly go</i>

03:06.500 --> 03:10.375
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:13.542 --> 04:15.583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

04:13.542 --> 04:15.583
<i>Supplemental:</i>

04:15.583 --> 04:18.542
<i>We are in orbit of a planet</i>

04:15.583 --> 04:18.542
<i>designated Rubicun 3</i>

04:18.542 --> 04:22.041
<i>the home of a life-form</i>

04:18.542 --> 04:22.041
<i>who call themselves the Edo.</i>

04:22.041 --> 04:24.917
<i>Our away team,</i>

04:22.041 --> 04:24.917
<i>including Wesley Crusher,</i>

04:24.917 --> 04:26.959
<i>has beamed down to</i>

04:24.917 --> 04:26.959
<i>make some arrangements</i>

04:26.959 --> 04:30.291
<i>concerning some</i>

04:26.959 --> 04:30.291
<i>well-earned recreation.</i>

04:38.917 --> 04:40.583
Careful, sir.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.583
No, it's all right, Lieutenant.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.625
Those are the Edo

04:40.583 --> 04:42.625
we met before.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.208
They certainly are fit.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.583
They certainly are.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.917
Health and happiness!

04:55.917 --> 04:57.083
A pleasant day to you!

04:57.083 --> 04:59.041
You did return as promised.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.125
Rivan, Liator.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.333
Also from our vessel,

05:10.125 --> 05:12.333
Troi and...

05:12.333 --> 05:14.667
Slowly, slowly.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.500
I must welcome

05:14.667 --> 05:17.500
this lovely one.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.959
Nice to see you again.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.333
My pleasure.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.625
RIKER:

05:37.333 --> 05:39.625
Counselor?

05:39.625 --> 05:41.458
Healthy sensuality, sir.

05:41.458 --> 05:44.166
I feel mainly friendship

05:41.458 --> 05:44.166
and, um...

05:44.166 --> 05:46.542
happiness.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.250
And I welcome this huge one.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.834
Oh, yes!

05:56.750 --> 05:58.959
Nice planet.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.709
Yeah.

06:04.834 --> 06:07.375
But you are a young one.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.834
I do not know your custom

06:07.375 --> 06:10.834
regarding love.

06:10.834 --> 06:12.917
Uh...

06:14.917 --> 06:17.625
I guess...

06:17.625 --> 06:20.542
whatever you usually do.

06:25.709 --> 06:28.667
There are others

06:25.709 --> 06:28.667
who would like to visit here

06:28.667 --> 06:30.166
if you would give us

06:28.667 --> 06:30.166
a limit on the number.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.375
Whatever pleases you.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.834
We'll discuss it

06:31.375 --> 06:33.834
at the council chambers.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.709
Shall we go there now

06:33.834 --> 06:36.709
or remain and play?

06:36.709 --> 06:38.625
Play?

06:38.625 --> 06:40.959
At love.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.959
Unless you don't enjoy that.

06:45.458 --> 06:48.583
Perhaps<i> you</i> do.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.458
And you.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.333
Yes, I can see that you do.

06:58.333 --> 07:01.625
Maybe I should just

06:58.333 --> 07:01.625
go on ahead.

07:02.542 --> 07:04.458
Oh, this is unfair to him.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.959
We'll go on to

07:04.458 --> 07:06.959
the council chambers.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.000
You'll find young people

07:06.959 --> 07:09.000
your age there.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.500
Well, I can't

07:09.000 --> 07:12.500
make any promises.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
You don't have to.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.792
Our rules are simple.

07:16.792 --> 07:20.125
No one does anything

07:16.792 --> 07:20.125
uncomfortable to them.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.875
Come, our people will

07:20.125 --> 07:22.875
want to know you.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.291
Rivan, perhaps

07:22.875 --> 07:26.291
they can't run.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.375
Can't run?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.959
Of course we can run.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.959
Right, Commander?

07:30.959 --> 07:34.041
That's the custom here--

07:30.959 --> 07:34.041
running.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.667
Lead the way.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.375
When in Rome, eh?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.041
When in where, sir?

07:53.709 --> 07:56.125
Good health to you!

07:56.125 --> 07:58.291
Happiness to you!

07:58.291 --> 08:00.083
It's like an Eden here.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.250
Good health!

08:14.250 --> 08:15.917
I thought you might be

08:14.250 --> 08:15.917
out of breath.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.417
We may surprise you

08:15.917 --> 08:18.417
in a lot of ways.

08:18.417 --> 08:21.375
Children, we've brought

08:18.417 --> 08:21.375
you a new friend.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.875
Well, hello!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.875
Join us.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.208
Yes, please.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.250
Come on!

08:29.250 --> 08:30.458
This way.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.959
And now it's time for you

08:32.625 --> 08:35.959
to meet some new friends.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.250
Everyone!

09:09.250 --> 09:11.000
We've brought

09:09.250 --> 09:11.000
the visitors.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.875
Please, enjoy what we have.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.792
Come with me.

09:30.959 --> 09:33.250
I've traced it through

09:30.959 --> 09:33.250
our sensor channels, sir.

09:33.250 --> 09:37.000
It's not a glitch or any other

09:33.250 --> 09:37.000
form of error or malfunction.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.792
That's confirmed

09:37.000 --> 09:38.792
by my readings, Captain.

09:38.792 --> 09:41.083
It's a shadow something.

09:41.083 --> 09:44.458
Exactly, as if it were neither

09:41.083 --> 09:44.458
in or out of our dimension.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.041
What is, Commander?

09:46.041 --> 09:47.500
Whatever is sitting

09:46.041 --> 09:47.500
out there

09:47.500 --> 09:50.166
without triggering

09:47.500 --> 09:50.166
our alarm relays, sir.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.417
Center main viewer

09:50.166 --> 09:52.417
on that area.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.583
I see nothing, Commander.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.792
<i>Enterprise</i> to object

10:00.583 --> 10:03.792
off our starboard bow.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.166
Request that you

10:03.792 --> 10:06.166
identify yourself.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

10:26.333 --> 10:28.166
Shields and deflectors

10:26.333 --> 10:28.166
up full, sir.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.917
Main phaser banks ready.

10:29.917 --> 10:31.917
Hailing frequencies--

10:29.917 --> 10:31.917
any reply?

10:31.917 --> 10:33.625
It was something

10:31.917 --> 10:33.625
unintelligible, sir.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.625
Now running it through

10:33.625 --> 10:35.625
language and logic circuits.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.709
Geordi?

10:35.625 --> 10:36.709
Sir?

10:36.709 --> 10:39.834
Have a real look.

10:36.709 --> 10:39.834
Aye, sir.

10:39.834 --> 10:43.667
Sir, my sensors read it...

10:39.834 --> 10:43.667
well, as half there.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.792
And it does look as if

10:43.667 --> 10:46.792
it were partly transparent.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.458
Data, what the hell is it?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.834
Lieutenant La Forge

11:05.792 --> 11:07.834
to Captain.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.208
Go ahead, La Forge.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.208
What can you make out?

11:11.208 --> 11:14.000
This is something

11:11.208 --> 11:14.000
I've never seen before, sir.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.709
After complete spectral

11:14.000 --> 11:17.709
analysis, it's...

11:17.709 --> 11:20.041
well, it's as if

11:17.709 --> 11:20.041
it's not really there.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.041
I don't understand it.

11:22.041 --> 11:25.291
I've got some information

11:22.041 --> 11:25.291
on its first transmission, sir.

11:25.291 --> 11:29.166
It translates as "stand by."

11:29.166 --> 11:31.500
Sir, I see something

11:29.166 --> 11:31.500
coming out of that ship.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.333
Verified, sir.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.375
Something very small.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.583
What is it?

11:51.417 --> 11:52.625
Intruder alert, sir.

11:52.625 --> 11:54.875
I don't show

11:52.625 --> 11:54.875
a location.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.083
The away team signal

11:54.875 --> 11:57.083
has been cut off, Captain.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.041
We've lost contact

11:57.083 --> 11:59.041
with our people.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.000
Intruder relays

11:59.041 --> 12:01.000
do show something.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.834
Why has everything become

12:01.000 --> 12:04.834
a "something" or a "whatever"?

12:23.083 --> 12:27.291
MALE VOICE:

12:23.083 --> 12:27.291
State... the... purpose.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.125
State the purpose

12:32.000 --> 12:36.125
of what you have done.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.000
I'm Captain Picard

12:39.000 --> 12:41.542
commanding this

12:39.000 --> 12:41.542
Federation starship.

12:46.834 --> 12:51.208
State the purpose

12:46.834 --> 12:51.208
of your visit here.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.583
We have sent down

12:53.917 --> 12:56.583
what we call an away team

12:56.583 --> 12:59.625
to make peaceful contact here.

12:59.625 --> 13:04.000
Do you plan to leave

12:59.625 --> 13:04.000
life-forms here?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.041
No.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.750
We are merely visiting here.

13:07.750 --> 13:11.792
But you did more at the world

13:07.750 --> 13:11.792
you just left.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.667
Why have you left

13:11.792 --> 13:15.667
your own life-forms there?

13:15.667 --> 13:19.500
The colony we

13:15.667 --> 13:19.500
just planted, sir.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.041
We found that world

13:19.500 --> 13:21.041
uninhabited.

13:21.041 --> 13:24.250
The life-forms

13:21.041 --> 13:24.250
we left there had...

13:25.583 --> 13:27.333
had sought the challenge--

13:27.333 --> 13:30.500
at least, that is

13:27.333 --> 13:30.500
the basic reason--

13:30.500 --> 13:32.792
had sought the challenge

13:32.792 --> 13:36.792
of creating a new lifestyle--

13:36.792 --> 13:38.875
a new society there.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.625
Life on our world

13:38.875 --> 13:41.625
is driven

13:41.625 --> 13:43.709
to protect itself

13:43.709 --> 13:46.500
by seeding itself

13:43.709 --> 13:46.500
as widely as possible.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.166
Do not interfere

13:49.166 --> 13:51.667
with my children below.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.417
Captain...

14:00.417 --> 14:03.500
I do not

14:00.417 --> 14:03.500
understand how

14:03.500 --> 14:07.041
but it is asking me

14:03.500 --> 14:07.041
if I was constructed

14:07.041 --> 14:10.500
for information exchange.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.417
If there is any way

14:10.500 --> 14:13.417
of finding out

14:13.417 --> 14:15.709
whatever it is

14:13.417 --> 14:15.709
out there, Data...

14:35.750 --> 14:38.583
Watch! I bet you

14:35.750 --> 14:38.583
can't do this!

14:45.333 --> 14:47.250
Watch this.

14:53.875 --> 14:57.333
I want to do something,

14:53.875 --> 14:57.333
too, with you.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.625
Uh, what?

15:00.625 --> 15:03.083
It's something you can

15:00.625 --> 15:03.083
teach me. Will you?

15:03.083 --> 15:07.166
Uh... well, actually,

15:07.166 --> 15:10.125
there are some games

15:07.166 --> 15:10.125
I don't quite know yet.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.750
It's playing ball.

15:11.750 --> 15:12.834
Will you teach me?

15:12.834 --> 15:14.750
Oh, sure.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.166
If you have a bat

15:14.750 --> 15:17.166
for the ball,

15:17.166 --> 15:19.834
I can show you

15:17.166 --> 15:19.834
my favorite.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.834
A bat?

15:25.208 --> 15:27.667
A stick or a branch.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.875
Um, about this long,

15:27.667 --> 15:30.875
this thick.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.417
We can get it in the gardens.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.417
Come on!

15:48.875 --> 15:51.917
This will please you.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.917
Join us.

15:51.917 --> 15:55.083
Thanks, another time.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.208
Joy and happiness.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.709
It certainly is.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.250
The good life, Worf.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.750
I am not concerned

16:10.250 --> 16:12.750
with pleasure, Commander.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.083
I am a warrior.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.500
Even Klingons need

16:15.083 --> 16:17.500
love now and then.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.875
For what we consider love, sir,

16:17.500 --> 16:20.875
I would need a Klingon woman.

16:20.875 --> 16:23.041
What about plain old basic sex?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.709
You must have

16:23.041 --> 16:24.709
some need for that.

16:24.709 --> 16:27.917
Of course, but with the females

16:24.709 --> 16:27.917
available to me, sir--

16:27.917 --> 16:29.625
Earth females--

16:29.625 --> 16:32.417
I must restrain myself

16:29.625 --> 16:32.417
too much.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.792
They are quite fragile, sir.

16:34.792 --> 16:37.041
Worf, if anyone else

16:34.792 --> 16:37.041
had said that,

16:37.041 --> 16:39.208
I'd suspect

16:37.041 --> 16:39.208
he was bragging.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.625
Bragging, sir?

16:41.625 --> 16:44.000
I think I'll

16:41.625 --> 16:44.000
pass on that.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.834
I better check in.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.333
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.583
Captain, do you read me?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.709
Let's...

16:57.709 --> 16:59.583
This may be nothing,

16:59.583 --> 17:02.291
but let's move

16:59.583 --> 17:02.291
all our people together.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.458
Including Wesley, the boy?

17:04.458 --> 17:06.417
He's outside.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.375
Is there a problem?

17:08.375 --> 17:10.834
We've lost contact

17:08.375 --> 17:10.834
with our ship.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.792
Well, it's nothing

17:10.834 --> 17:12.792
these people have done.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.709
I'm certain of that.

17:14.709 --> 17:17.208
Their minds are so open.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.250
Help me locate Wes.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.250
He's wandered off.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.750
That is extraordinary.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.667
May I take a moment of

17:35.750 --> 17:37.667
your time, Lieutenant?

17:37.667 --> 17:40.208
Yes, Worf, but you've got

17:37.667 --> 17:40.208
to hear this.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.750
Are you telling me that there's

17:40.208 --> 17:43.750
no crime here whatsoever?

17:43.750 --> 17:46.166
No one breaks

17:43.750 --> 17:46.166
any laws?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.542
Once they did.

17:47.542 --> 17:51.083
Long, long ago,

17:47.542 --> 17:51.083
there was much disorder.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.500
But not now.

17:52.500 --> 17:56.250
But I've seen no sign

17:52.500 --> 17:56.250
of police.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.166
Those who enforce laws.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.250
RIVAN:

18:00.166 --> 18:02.250
Oh, we have very few.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.709
They are called mediators

18:04.709 --> 18:06.959
and they are needed only

18:04.709 --> 18:06.959
in one place each day.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.500
The punishment zone,

18:08.500 --> 18:11.000
an area that's selected

18:08.500 --> 18:11.000
for a period of time.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.083
It's a completely

18:11.000 --> 18:13.083
random selection?

18:13.083 --> 18:15.417
No one but our mediators

18:13.083 --> 18:15.417
know what place

18:15.417 --> 18:17.041
or for how long.

18:17.041 --> 18:19.750
We're very proud of

18:17.041 --> 18:19.750
the wisdom of our ancestors.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.875
No person ever knows where

18:19.750 --> 18:22.875
or when a zone will be.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.959
And so no one

18:22.875 --> 18:24.959
risks death.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.625
Death?

18:26.625 --> 18:29.208
By breaking any law.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.959
Wait, explain this.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.875
Only one punishment

18:30.959 --> 18:33.875
for any crime.

18:33.875 --> 18:37.250
Anyone who commits any crime

18:33.875 --> 18:37.250
in the punishment zone dies?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.250
The law is the law.

18:39.250 --> 18:42.041
Our peace is built on that.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.750
Even a small thing...

18:43.750 --> 18:47.083
such as ignoring the rule

18:43.750 --> 18:47.083
"keep off the grass"?

18:47.083 --> 18:49.500
Well, then,

18:47.083 --> 18:49.500
no one breaks that rule.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.834
Who wants to risk execution?

18:51.834 --> 18:53.792
And there's always

18:51.834 --> 18:53.792
a white wall or fence

18:53.792 --> 18:56.875
to remind anyone

18:53.792 --> 18:56.875
of a forbidden area like that.

18:56.875 --> 19:00.917
And just who tells visitors

18:56.875 --> 19:00.917
about these rules?

19:00.917 --> 19:02.792
We'd better find Wesley.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.166
(<i> laughing</i> )

19:18.166 --> 19:19.542
Here.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.500
Catch, catch.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.125
All right. Over here.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.458
Yeah!

19:24.458 --> 19:25.625
Throw it back.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.375
All right. Oh, good catch.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.458
Here it comes.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.875
Right here.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.750
There you go.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.959
Hey!

19:37.959 --> 19:39.834
Here it comes.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.834
You're very

19:42.250 --> 19:43.834
clever at this.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.500
At home, we play a lot of it.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.291
Here, toss the ball

19:45.500 --> 19:47.291
ahead of me.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.083
No, Wes!

19:53.083 --> 19:56.542
No, it's forbidden

19:53.083 --> 19:56.542
to disturb new plants.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.041
Couldn't you

20:06.166 --> 20:08.041
see the fence?

20:08.041 --> 20:09.250
It's for new plants.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.875
Don't ever past

20:09.250 --> 20:11.875
a white marker.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.291
It's okay.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.166
I'm fine.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.041
Oh, no!

20:18.041 --> 20:20.000
Oh, please, no!

20:23.709 --> 20:24.917
Speak the truth.

20:24.917 --> 20:27.208
We are mediators.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.709
I said I was fine.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.291
He doesn't know!

20:28.709 --> 20:31.291
He's from another place!

20:31.291 --> 20:35.208
How very sad, but this zone

20:31.291 --> 20:35.208
has been selected.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.041
But he doesn't understand.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.792
It's always sad.

20:38.792 --> 20:41.208
Now doubly so.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.041
I was chasing

20:43.000 --> 20:45.041
a ball

20:45.041 --> 20:47.333
and I fell into that.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.834
I'm really sorry.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.667
You admit you

20:49.834 --> 20:51.667
did that?

20:51.667 --> 20:52.792
Freely?

20:52.792 --> 20:55.834
I'm with Starfleet.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.583
We don't lie.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.625
It won't happen again.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.959
We apologize.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.917
We're sorry, too,

21:04.917 --> 21:06.917
but that

21:04.917 --> 21:06.917
changes nothing.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.000
Careful, Commander.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.583
They've got some

21:09.000 --> 21:11.583
strange laws here.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.208
I thought you

21:11.583 --> 21:13.208
reviewed their laws.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.375
But they listed nothing

21:13.208 --> 21:15.375
about punishment.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.625
One moment, please.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.834
Is there a witness

21:17.625 --> 21:19.834
to this transgression?

21:19.834 --> 21:21.625
But it was my fault.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.917
<i>I</i> threw

21:21.625 --> 21:23.917
the ball past him.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.875
We have a visible

21:23.917 --> 21:25.875
transgression

21:25.875 --> 21:27.625
ample witnesses

21:27.625 --> 21:30.250
and an admission

21:27.625 --> 21:30.250
of guilt.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.917
And though it pains

21:30.250 --> 21:32.917
us deeply to do it, we must.

21:35.750 --> 21:39.083
Are you prepared

21:35.750 --> 21:39.083
for punishment?

21:39.083 --> 21:40.583
Punishment?

21:40.583 --> 21:43.000
If you mean what the others

21:40.583 --> 21:43.000
were talking about...

21:43.000 --> 21:45.166
What punishment? Name it.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.375
Death, of course.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.750
Don't make it

21:46.375 --> 21:48.750
difficult for the boy.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.667
Drop it!

21:54.667 --> 21:56.875
Drop it now!

22:08.375 --> 22:11.625
It's a kind of syringe.

22:11.625 --> 22:12.917
What is this?

22:12.917 --> 22:14.500
You said death.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.500
Is this poison?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.375
But... but of course it is--

22:14.500 --> 22:17.375
completely painless.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.417
The boy would have

22:17.375 --> 22:19.417
felt nothing.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.041
But look at him now.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.000
You frightened him.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.208
He was going to kill me?

22:25.208 --> 22:27.583
And if this zone

22:25.208 --> 22:27.583
was still in effect,

22:27.583 --> 22:30.041
you would all deserve death.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.500
It was announced

22:30.041 --> 22:32.500
you came as friends.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.667
Is this how

22:32.500 --> 22:35.667
friends act?

22:42.041 --> 22:44.291
<i>Enterprise</i> from away team.

22:44.291 --> 22:46.125
Come in.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.166
Are you receiving us,

22:47.667 --> 22:50.166
<i>Enterprise?</i>

23:00.333 --> 23:01.917
Condition?

23:01.917 --> 23:03.166
No sign of

23:01.917 --> 23:03.166
consciousness

23:03.166 --> 23:04.667
but the balance

23:03.166 --> 23:04.667
of the readings

23:04.667 --> 23:06.291
are quite normal

23:04.667 --> 23:06.291
for him.

23:06.291 --> 23:09.166
I believe this is some form

23:06.291 --> 23:09.166
of information exchange

23:09.166 --> 23:11.458
with whatever is over there.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.959
At least, I hope it is.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.166
Any communication

23:12.959 --> 23:15.166
from the away team?

23:15.166 --> 23:18.500
Something is blocking

23:15.166 --> 23:18.500
communication both...

23:22.542 --> 23:25.333
YAR:

23:22.542 --> 23:25.333
Security, urgent.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.083
Repeating,

23:25.333 --> 23:27.083
<i>Enterprise</i> from away team.

23:27.083 --> 23:29.250
This is the<i> Enterprise,</i>

23:27.083 --> 23:29.250
Lieutenant.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.583
We're receiving you now.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.458
This is an urgent call

23:30.583 --> 23:33.458
for Captain Picard.

23:33.458 --> 23:35.333
RIKER:

23:33.458 --> 23:35.333
We may need your presence

23:33.458 --> 23:35.333
here, Captain.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.667
We have serious trouble

23:35.333 --> 23:38.667
with a member of our away team

23:38.667 --> 23:41.750
and an unusual law

23:38.667 --> 23:41.750
they have here.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.417
Captain to Riker. Stand by.

23:43.417 --> 23:45.041
Any signs of consciousness?

23:45.041 --> 23:46.208
Not yet.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.458
It could be

23:46.208 --> 23:47.458
minutes or hours.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.208
It's unclear what's

23:47.458 --> 23:49.208
happened to him.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.375
Take him to Sick Bay, let me

23:49.208 --> 23:51.375
know the instant he's awake.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.500
Anything new on

23:51.375 --> 23:53.500
that thing over there?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.458
Negative, sir.

23:55.458 --> 23:58.834
Captain to First Officer,

23:55.458 --> 23:58.834
I'm beaming down.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.583
Would you care to

24:25.375 --> 24:27.583
comment privately

24:27.583 --> 24:29.500
on how you read

24:27.583 --> 24:29.500
any of this?

24:29.500 --> 24:31.291
Unnecessary, sir.

24:31.291 --> 24:34.083
These people are honest,

24:31.291 --> 24:34.083
almost to a fault,

24:34.083 --> 24:37.333
and they have great pride

24:34.083 --> 24:37.333
in their ways.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.667
You're the Captain?

24:40.667 --> 24:42.166
We're ready.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.542
This way, please.

24:58.625 --> 25:02.000
Welcome to our world, Captain.

24:58.625 --> 25:02.000
Thank you.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.125
We regret that our system of

25:02.000 --> 25:05.125
justice is troubling you.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.917
The boy, Wesley Crusher,

25:05.125 --> 25:07.917
where is he, please?

25:07.917 --> 25:09.875
In accord

25:07.917 --> 25:09.875
with the Prime Directive,

25:09.875 --> 25:12.750
I've allowed them to hold him

25:09.875 --> 25:12.750
pending the outcome of this.

25:12.750 --> 25:15.291
He is safe

25:12.750 --> 25:15.291
and unharmed.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.875
We promise that.

25:16.875 --> 25:20.375
Captain Picard, I do not

25:16.875 --> 25:20.375
know how you Earth people

25:20.375 --> 25:22.083
conduct law and justice--

25:22.083 --> 25:24.500
even if you respect

25:22.083 --> 25:24.500
such things.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.125
We do.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.458
Good. So do we.

25:28.458 --> 25:32.500
Our precepts have been

25:28.458 --> 25:32.500
handed down from long ago.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.834
The tranquility you see in

25:32.500 --> 25:35.834
our lives has been made possible

25:35.834 --> 25:37.166
by our laws.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.917
RIVAN:

25:37.166 --> 25:38.917
We are a people of law.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.208
They do sometimes

25:38.917 --> 25:41.208
bring us sadness,

25:41.208 --> 25:44.041
but we have learned

25:41.208 --> 25:44.041
to adjust to that.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.250
Perhaps your laws

25:44.041 --> 25:46.250
work as well?

25:46.250 --> 25:49.542
They haven't always,

25:46.250 --> 25:49.542
but now they do.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.834
Do you execute criminals?

25:51.834 --> 25:54.125
No, not any longer.

25:54.125 --> 25:55.500
RIVAN:

25:54.125 --> 25:55.500
But you did once?

25:55.500 --> 25:58.375
Unfortunately, yes.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.375
But since then...

25:58.375 --> 26:01.250
And when you did, was it

25:58.375 --> 26:01.250
believed necessary to do so?

26:02.792 --> 26:05.333
Some people felt

26:02.792 --> 26:05.333
that it was necessary,

26:05.333 --> 26:08.709
but we have learned to detect

26:05.333 --> 26:08.709
the seeds of criminal behavior.

26:08.709 --> 26:11.375
Capital punishment,

26:08.709 --> 26:11.375
in our world,

26:11.375 --> 26:14.333
is no longer considered

26:11.375 --> 26:14.333
a justifiable deterrent.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.792
So...

26:16.792 --> 26:19.875
we are not yet

26:16.792 --> 26:19.875
as advanced as they are.

26:21.709 --> 26:24.458
And since you are advanced

26:21.709 --> 26:24.458
in other ways, too,

26:24.458 --> 26:28.333
I suggest you use your superior

26:24.458 --> 26:28.333
powers to rescue the Wesley boy.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.166
We will record him

26:28.333 --> 26:31.166
as a convicted criminal

26:31.166 --> 26:32.834
out of our reach--

26:32.834 --> 26:36.458
an advanced person who luckily

26:32.834 --> 26:36.458
escaped the barbarism

26:36.458 --> 26:38.709
of this backward little world.

26:38.709 --> 26:43.041
Unfortunately, we have a law

26:38.709 --> 26:43.041
known as the Prime Directive.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.583
Riker has explained it to us.

26:46.959 --> 26:50.875
Is the boy in any danger

26:46.959 --> 26:50.875
from you at this moment?

26:52.959 --> 26:55.166
Until sundown?

26:57.208 --> 26:59.709
Because you

26:57.208 --> 26:59.709
are strangers,

26:59.709 --> 27:01.917
we are delaying

26:59.709 --> 27:01.917
enforcement of the law,

27:01.917 --> 27:04.709
but we must act

27:01.917 --> 27:04.709
by sundown.

27:04.709 --> 27:06.917
Then I have another question.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.709
While orbiting-- while circling

27:06.917 --> 27:10.709
high above your world--

27:10.709 --> 27:14.542
as we do, we have

27:10.709 --> 27:14.542
encountered a strange object.

27:14.542 --> 27:17.875
A vessel, perhaps.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.333
Have you any idea what it is?

27:20.333 --> 27:22.875
It's not entirely real.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.834
At least it's not

27:22.875 --> 27:26.834
completely solid.

27:29.834 --> 27:32.250
Do you mean God?

27:32.250 --> 27:34.333
God?

27:34.333 --> 27:37.375
God is said to be

27:34.333 --> 27:37.375
somewhere up there

27:37.375 --> 27:39.083
protecting us.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.083
Exactly...

27:41.083 --> 27:43.417
exactly how would you

27:41.083 --> 27:43.417
describe God?

27:43.417 --> 27:44.959
As you just did.

27:44.959 --> 27:48.417
As existing both here

27:44.959 --> 27:48.417
and in another place, also.

27:48.417 --> 27:52.500
But when God wants to

27:48.417 --> 27:52.500
show its power,

27:52.500 --> 27:55.000
it can make itself felt

27:52.500 --> 27:55.000
most fully.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.125
BEVERLY:

27:56.834 --> 27:59.125
Captain, come in, please.

27:59.125 --> 28:00.375
Picard here.

28:00.375 --> 28:01.917
CMO Crusher, sir.

28:01.917 --> 28:04.041
Commander Data has just

28:01.917 --> 28:04.041
regained consciousness.

28:04.041 --> 28:05.834
What condition? Can he talk?

28:05.834 --> 28:08.792
He's insisting on it,

28:05.834 --> 28:08.792
sir, urgently.

28:10.959 --> 28:13.583
Wesley...

28:15.041 --> 28:17.917
Stand by. Picard out.

28:17.917 --> 28:21.125
I want to speak to her

28:17.917 --> 28:21.125
personally about her son.

28:24.125 --> 28:28.208
And so you promise that Wesley

28:24.125 --> 28:28.208
Crusher is safe until sundown?

28:28.208 --> 28:30.625
You have our word.

28:32.125 --> 28:35.458
Then will one of you

28:32.125 --> 28:35.458
return with me to our ship?

28:37.834 --> 28:39.375
Of course.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.333
I'll go as a hostage

28:39.375 --> 28:41.333
for the boy's safety.

28:41.333 --> 28:42.917
No, no, no, that's not it.

28:42.917 --> 28:45.875
I want you to identify

28:42.917 --> 28:45.875
something for me, if you can.

28:45.875 --> 28:49.333
Picard to Transporter Room,

28:45.875 --> 28:49.333
three to beam up.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.709
I'm frightened.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.000
There's no

28:57.709 --> 28:59.000
reason to be.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.083
Transporter Room,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.083
energize.

29:12.458 --> 29:15.375
But this is a city!

29:12.458 --> 29:15.375
A great city.

29:15.375 --> 29:18.333
Captain, I've just seen the

29:15.375 --> 29:18.333
away team report about Wesley.

29:18.333 --> 29:19.959
In a moment, Doctor.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.333
In a moment?!

29:21.333 --> 29:23.500
Exactly. In a moment.

29:25.792 --> 29:28.166
You were about to say?

29:28.166 --> 29:30.458
Well, since you have

29:28.166 --> 29:30.458
all this power,

29:30.458 --> 29:32.875
why be concerned

29:30.458 --> 29:32.875
about our laws?

29:32.875 --> 29:35.208
You could take

29:32.875 --> 29:35.208
the boy from us.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.583
It's not that simple.

29:42.583 --> 29:45.917
From the

29:42.583 --> 29:45.917
starboard lounge

29:45.917 --> 29:48.542
you can see whatever

29:45.917 --> 29:48.542
is outside this vessel.

29:48.542 --> 29:50.583
Do you mean my world?

29:50.583 --> 29:52.625
You said we'd be

29:50.583 --> 29:52.625
high above it.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.875
And something else

29:52.625 --> 29:55.875
that's circling your world.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.417
It's very

29:55.875 --> 29:57.417
important to us

29:57.417 --> 30:00.333
and perhaps to you

29:57.417 --> 30:00.333
to know what it is.

30:15.458 --> 30:18.542
I'm sorry, Rivan,

30:15.458 --> 30:18.542
but this was necessary.

30:18.542 --> 30:20.542
Do you know what that is?

30:23.625 --> 30:26.250
Can you tell us

30:23.625 --> 30:26.250
what it is?

30:26.250 --> 30:28.583
Is it God?

30:31.583 --> 30:35.250
Now, it's very important

30:31.583 --> 30:35.250
that you answer something.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.792
How do you recognize

30:35.250 --> 30:37.792
what it is?

30:44.291 --> 30:47.834
Nothing will harm you,

30:44.291 --> 30:47.834
I promise.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.792
Just tell us

30:47.834 --> 30:50.792
how you recognize it.

30:52.166 --> 30:54.834
It has appeared before.

30:56.709 --> 30:59.250
Can you speak to it?

30:59.250 --> 31:01.500
Does it speak

30:59.250 --> 31:01.500
to you?

31:02.625 --> 31:04.333
Captain!

31:10.208 --> 31:13.208
Return my child!

31:13.208 --> 31:15.291
Return?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.959
It's coming

31:15.291 --> 31:17.959
towards us.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.333
Picard to Transporter Room.

31:22.333 --> 31:24.458
Come in.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.750
Yes, do that, but hurry!

31:25.750 --> 31:27.417
It's still coming towards us.

31:27.417 --> 31:30.208
Transporter Chief to Captain.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.250
One to beam down

31:30.208 --> 31:32.250
to away team location.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.583
Hurry!

31:33.583 --> 31:37.417
Engage, Transporter

31:33.583 --> 31:37.417
Room. Urgent, engage!

31:55.500 --> 31:59.458
It seems the Edos' god is

31:55.500 --> 31:59.458
very protective of its children.

31:59.458 --> 32:03.417
I had no choice but to learn

31:59.458 --> 32:03.417
about that thing from her.

32:03.417 --> 32:05.917
I'm sorry I had to.

32:05.917 --> 32:08.083
She was so frightened.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.500
It's understandable, sir.

32:10.500 --> 32:14.500
Sharing an orbit with God

32:10.500 --> 32:14.500
is no small experience.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.458
Let's go see your patient,

32:16.125 --> 32:18.458
Doctor.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.417
What do you intend

32:22.375 --> 32:25.417
to do about my son?

32:25.417 --> 32:28.125
He's being held safely

32:25.417 --> 32:28.125
until sundown.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.667
When he faces execution!

32:29.667 --> 32:31.834
Although he's

32:29.667 --> 32:31.834
committed no crime--

32:31.834 --> 32:33.917
certainly none any sane

32:31.834 --> 32:33.917
and reasonable person...

32:33.917 --> 32:36.166
You saw what that thing

32:33.917 --> 32:36.166
was about to do.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.500
I apologize, sir,

32:39.500 --> 32:42.208
but this is very

32:39.500 --> 32:42.208
difficult for me.

32:42.208 --> 32:44.542
If he were your son,

32:42.208 --> 32:44.542
you'd be as frightened...

32:44.542 --> 32:46.208
But I am.

32:49.208 --> 32:52.000
Data's in Sick Bay here.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.667
You'll find him able

32:52.000 --> 32:54.667
to talk to you.

32:56.917 --> 32:58.792
He's checking out

32:56.917 --> 32:58.792
fine, Doctor.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.417
Thank you.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.417
Finish it later, please.

33:01.417 --> 33:03.834
I was an excellent choice

33:01.417 --> 33:03.834
for them, Captain.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.750
They were able to

33:03.834 --> 33:06.750
communicate with me quite...

33:06.750 --> 33:09.250
I was about to say

33:06.750 --> 33:09.250
quite easily,

33:09.250 --> 33:11.083
but there was nothing

33:09.250 --> 33:11.083
easy about it.

33:11.083 --> 33:13.000
Fortunately,

33:11.083 --> 33:13.000
they stopped short

33:13.000 --> 33:14.709
of overloading

33:13.000 --> 33:14.709
my circuitry.

33:14.709 --> 33:17.458
You're saying<i> they?</i>

33:14.709 --> 33:17.458
So it is a vessel of some sort?

33:17.458 --> 33:20.875
Definitely not a single entity,

33:17.458 --> 33:20.875
if that's what you mean, sir.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.583
Although they know the Edo

33:20.875 --> 33:23.583
worship them as a god thing.

33:23.583 --> 33:25.250
They know?

33:25.250 --> 33:27.750
They recognize that this is

33:25.250 --> 33:27.750
quite expected and harmless

33:27.750 --> 33:29.709
at the present Edo stage

33:27.750 --> 33:29.709
of evolution.

33:29.709 --> 33:32.542
What sort of vessel?

33:32.542 --> 33:34.375
It is perhaps not

33:34.375 --> 33:36.333
what we would understand

33:34.375 --> 33:36.333
as a vessel, sir.

33:36.333 --> 33:39.625
The dimensions this one occupies

33:36.333 --> 33:39.625
allows them to be...

33:39.625 --> 33:42.458
well, to be

33:39.625 --> 33:42.458
in several places at once.

33:42.458 --> 33:46.458
That they consider that this

33:42.458 --> 33:46.458
entire star cluster is theirs.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.000
It was probably unwise of us

33:48.000 --> 33:50.583
to attempt to place

33:48.000 --> 33:50.583
a human colony in this area.

33:50.583 --> 33:53.583
Of course, there are

33:50.583 --> 33:53.583
3,004 other planets

33:53.583 --> 33:56.291
in this star cluster in which

33:53.583 --> 33:56.291
we could have colonized.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.750
The largest and closest...

33:57.750 --> 33:59.500
Data! Don't babble.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.500
Babble, sir?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.333
I am not aware

34:01.500 --> 34:04.333
that I ever babble, sir.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.583
It may be

34:04.333 --> 34:06.583
that from time to time

34:06.583 --> 34:08.750
I have considerable

34:06.583 --> 34:08.750
information to communicate

34:08.750 --> 34:11.166
and you may question the way

34:08.750 --> 34:11.166
in which I organize it...

34:11.166 --> 34:15.458
Please, organize it into

34:11.166 --> 34:15.458
brief answers to my questions.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.333
We have very little time.

34:17.333 --> 34:21.166
Do they accept

34:21.166 --> 34:23.333
our presence at this planet?

34:23.333 --> 34:25.709
Undecided, sir.

34:27.875 --> 34:31.000
Data, please feel free

34:31.000 --> 34:33.542
to volunteer

34:31.000 --> 34:33.542
any important information.

34:33.542 --> 34:35.625
I volunteer

34:35.625 --> 34:37.709
that they are now

34:35.625 --> 34:37.709
observing us, sir.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.125
To judge what kind

34:37.709 --> 34:40.125
of life-forms we are?

34:40.125 --> 34:43.041
No. It is more curiosity.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.625
I doubt that they expect us

34:43.041 --> 34:46.625
to abide by their value systems.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.875
Do they know

34:46.625 --> 34:48.875
of our Prime Directive?

34:48.875 --> 34:52.250
They know everything I know,

34:48.875 --> 34:52.250
sir.

34:52.250 --> 34:57.250
And if we were to violate

34:52.250 --> 34:57.250
the Prime Directive...

34:57.250 --> 35:00.291
That's not a fair question.

35:00.291 --> 35:02.875
How would they react?

35:02.875 --> 35:06.250
That would be a case of judging

35:02.875 --> 35:06.250
us by our own rules, sir.

35:06.250 --> 35:09.000
If we violate

35:06.250 --> 35:09.000
our own Prime Directive,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.250
they might consider us to be

35:09.000 --> 35:12.250
deceitful and untrustworthy.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.000
You do recall,

35:12.250 --> 35:15.000
they cautioned us

35:15.000 --> 35:18.083
not to interfere with

35:15.000 --> 35:18.083
their children below.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.792
What has happened?

35:21.792 --> 35:24.750
The Edo want to

35:21.792 --> 35:24.750
execute my son.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.041
I will not allow that

35:24.750 --> 35:28.041
to happen, Jean-Luc!

35:28.959 --> 35:31.208
Most interesting, sir.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.667
The emotion

35:31.208 --> 35:32.667
of motherhood

35:32.667 --> 35:34.625
as compared to all others

35:32.667 --> 35:34.625
felt by humans...

35:34.625 --> 35:37.083
Shut up!

35:37.083 --> 35:39.500
You were right, sir.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.208
I do tend to babble.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

35:47.583 --> 35:50.917
<i>Stardate 41255.9:</i>

35:50.917 --> 35:53.959
<i>Whatever the object</i>

35:50.917 --> 35:53.959
<i>or vessel in orbit with us,</i>

35:53.959 --> 35:56.875
<i>it hangs there</i>

35:53.959 --> 35:56.875
<i>like a nemesis.</i>

35:56.875 --> 36:00.250
<i>It is one thing to communicate</i>

35:56.875 --> 36:00.250
<i>with something mysterious,</i>

36:00.250 --> 36:03.667
<i>but it is quite another</i>

36:00.250 --> 36:03.667
<i>to be silently observed by it.</i>

36:03.667 --> 36:06.166
<i>I am concerned</i>

36:03.667 --> 36:06.166
<i>whether it understands</i>

36:06.166 --> 36:09.542
<i>the same concept</i>

36:06.166 --> 36:09.542
<i>of reason that we do.</i>

36:09.542 --> 36:12.792
You sent for me, sir?

36:12.792 --> 36:15.375
Let's have

36:12.792 --> 36:15.375
more talk, Data.

36:15.375 --> 36:17.083
Yes, sir.

36:19.667 --> 36:21.208
Sit down.

36:23.792 --> 36:27.542
What level of

36:23.792 --> 36:27.542
communication, sir?

36:27.542 --> 36:29.542
Any.

36:29.542 --> 36:32.959
My apologies for saying

36:29.542 --> 36:32.959
that you babbled.

36:32.959 --> 36:35.083
But I do, sir.

36:35.083 --> 36:37.583
You also see things

36:35.083 --> 36:37.583
in a way we do not

36:37.583 --> 36:39.709
but as they truly are.

36:39.709 --> 36:41.500
I need help, my friend.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.875
I cannot permit that boy

36:41.500 --> 36:44.875
or any member of this vessel

36:44.875 --> 36:46.208
to be sacrificed.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.667
The Prime Directive

36:46.208 --> 36:48.667
never intended that.

36:48.667 --> 36:52.959
The problem, sir, is there.

36:52.959 --> 36:55.500
Although they have learned

36:52.959 --> 36:55.500
of the Prime Directive

36:55.500 --> 36:57.291
from my mind,

36:57.291 --> 36:59.291
how will they evaluate it?

36:59.291 --> 37:01.458
How do they reason?

37:01.458 --> 37:02.917
What are their values?

37:02.917 --> 37:05.125
Remember their

37:02.917 --> 37:05.125
warning to us, sir.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.792
Exactly.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.583
How do I explain my refusing

37:06.792 --> 37:09.583
to obey their laws down there?

37:09.583 --> 37:13.291
Not permitting

37:09.583 --> 37:13.291
the Crusher boy...

37:13.291 --> 37:15.417
to be executed.

37:15.417 --> 37:17.625
And by so doing,

37:15.417 --> 37:17.625
do I endanger this vessel

37:17.625 --> 37:20.542
and more than

37:17.625 --> 37:20.542
a thousand other lives?

37:20.542 --> 37:25.000
Would you choose one life

37:20.542 --> 37:25.000
over 1,000, sir?

37:26.542 --> 37:30.333
I refuse to let arithmetic

37:26.542 --> 37:30.333
decide questions like that.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.959
Did you learn anything

37:32.959 --> 37:35.417
about the relationship

37:32.959 --> 37:35.417
between that and the Edo?

37:35.417 --> 37:38.125
Why are they so certain

37:35.417 --> 37:38.125
it's a god?

37:38.125 --> 37:40.125
Any sufficiently

37:38.125 --> 37:40.125
advanced life-form

37:40.125 --> 37:42.625
would appear to others

37:40.125 --> 37:42.625
to be that, sir.

37:42.625 --> 37:45.750
But when they were probing

37:42.625 --> 37:45.750
my thoughts, Captain,

37:45.750 --> 37:47.834
I could feel that

37:45.750 --> 37:47.834
whatever they are now,

37:47.834 --> 37:51.792
they once existed in this

37:47.834 --> 37:51.792
dimension just as we do--

37:51.792 --> 37:55.750
perhaps in the same kind

37:51.792 --> 37:55.750
of flesh and blood form.

37:55.750 --> 37:57.291
Since then, however,

37:57.291 --> 38:00.125
they have evolved

37:57.291 --> 38:00.125
considerably.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.625
Their present existence

38:00.125 --> 38:02.625
in multi-dimensions

38:02.625 --> 38:05.583
no doubt has advantages

38:02.625 --> 38:05.583
we do not understand.

38:05.583 --> 38:08.542
Then, in some earlier

38:05.583 --> 38:08.542
flesh-and-blood form,

38:08.542 --> 38:10.834
they might have shared

38:08.542 --> 38:10.834
our kind of values?

38:10.834 --> 38:13.208
We know the Edo

38:10.834 --> 38:13.208
share them, sir.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.041
Why would such

38:13.208 --> 38:16.041
an advanced thing

38:16.041 --> 38:18.458
feel obliged

38:16.041 --> 38:18.458
to protect the Edo?

38:18.458 --> 38:23.375
Perhaps the Edo are

38:18.458 --> 38:23.375
a child race, by comparison.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.583
Possibly a race which...

38:25.583 --> 38:27.917
those life-forms

38:25.583 --> 38:27.917
have planted here

38:27.917 --> 38:30.166
much as we now plant

38:27.917 --> 38:30.166
human colonies

38:30.166 --> 38:32.667
on class M planets.

38:37.834 --> 38:40.291
Having fulfilled

38:37.834 --> 38:40.291
my professional obligations

38:40.291 --> 38:41.917
regarding Commander Data...

38:41.917 --> 38:44.417
You now request permission

38:41.917 --> 38:44.417
to beam down to the planet.

38:44.417 --> 38:46.333
Permission granted.

38:46.333 --> 38:49.041
You can accompany me

38:46.333 --> 38:49.041
while I try and resolve this.

38:51.166 --> 38:55.250
And you should know

38:51.166 --> 38:55.250
that whatever the cost

38:55.250 --> 38:58.417
I will not allow them

38:55.250 --> 38:58.417
to execute your son.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.875
Thank you, sir.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.959
Data, take command.

39:09.959 --> 39:11.458
Aye, sir.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.917
It's almost time.

39:22.917 --> 39:25.166
I want the boy

39:22.917 --> 39:25.166
brought here now.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.041
I'll go with you.

39:29.041 --> 39:31.000
Of course.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.667
Captain Picard.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.875
I saw you share

39:45.208 --> 39:47.875
the sky with God.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.250
You must be gods.

39:53.667 --> 39:58.083
No, no, we're not gods.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.041
Mother.

40:07.542 --> 40:09.959
I guess you know

40:07.542 --> 40:09.959
a lot has happened here.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.959
I know.

40:14.208 --> 40:17.792
Captain Picard...

40:17.792 --> 40:20.000
are you going to

40:17.792 --> 40:20.000
let them kill me?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.667
No.

40:22.667 --> 40:26.083
But I must find some way to

40:22.667 --> 40:26.083
prevent it that<i> you</i> understand.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.333
How can we let

40:26.083 --> 40:28.333
this happen, Liator?

40:28.333 --> 40:32.166
They threaten

40:28.333 --> 40:32.166
everything we respect.

40:32.166 --> 40:36.375
Our law, our peace,

40:32.166 --> 40:36.375
our tranquility and order.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.291
You are powerful,

40:38.291 --> 40:40.041
but do not do this to us.

40:40.041 --> 40:41.375
We beg you.

40:41.375 --> 40:44.375
At least, study what

40:41.375 --> 40:44.375
we were without law--

40:44.375 --> 40:47.542
hurtful to each other,

40:44.375 --> 40:47.542
savage, thieving.

40:47.542 --> 40:49.667
I understand.

40:49.667 --> 40:52.917
Perhaps your system of law

40:49.667 --> 40:52.917
and punishment

40:52.917 --> 40:55.000
is better than any system

40:52.917 --> 40:55.000
we once had,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.291
but we do now have a law

40:55.000 --> 40:58.291
and must obey.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.041
And part of it says

41:00.041 --> 41:02.834
that I must protect

41:00.041 --> 41:02.834
my people from harm.

41:02.834 --> 41:05.834
We did not ask you

41:02.834 --> 41:05.834
to come here.

41:05.834 --> 41:09.166
Which has to do

41:05.834 --> 41:09.166
with another law

41:09.166 --> 41:10.875
that we must obey.

41:10.875 --> 41:14.375
We are all sworn

41:10.875 --> 41:14.375
not to interfere

41:14.375 --> 41:16.250
with other lives

41:14.375 --> 41:16.250
in the galaxy.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.834
If I save this boy,

41:16.250 --> 41:18.834
I break that law.

41:18.834 --> 41:21.625
And you should

41:18.834 --> 41:21.625
be executed if you do so.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.375
I may suffer almost as much.

41:23.375 --> 41:26.291
Starfleet takes the Prime

41:23.375 --> 41:26.291
Directive very seriously.

41:26.291 --> 41:30.041
No, it is God

41:26.291 --> 41:30.041
who will punish you.

41:30.041 --> 41:32.458
That thought

41:30.041 --> 41:32.458
has crossed our minds.

41:32.458 --> 41:34.250
Your God up there may insist

41:34.250 --> 41:37.000
that we obey our

41:34.250 --> 41:37.000
noninterference directive.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.667
Sir, does this mean

41:37.000 --> 41:40.667
if you save me,

41:40.667 --> 41:42.625
the entire crew could die?

41:42.625 --> 41:44.750
You're not involved

41:42.625 --> 41:44.750
in this decision, boy.

41:44.750 --> 41:48.291
I'm sorry, sir,

41:44.750 --> 41:48.291
but it seems like I am.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.083
Picard to Transporter Room.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.083
Lock in to this signal.

41:53.083 --> 41:54.750
Stand by for six

41:53.083 --> 41:54.750
to beam up.

41:54.750 --> 41:57.250
Wesley, Lieutenant.

42:03.917 --> 42:05.834
Our laws have been violated.

42:05.834 --> 42:07.417
What of justice?

42:07.417 --> 42:09.750
What of justice to Wesley?

42:09.750 --> 42:12.083
Does he deserve to die?

42:12.083 --> 42:14.500
I'm truly sorry, Liator,

42:12.083 --> 42:14.500
but I must have justice

42:14.500 --> 42:16.542
for my people, too.

42:16.542 --> 42:19.375
Transporter Room, energize.

42:26.458 --> 42:28.500
Transporter Room, come in.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.041
We can't energize the beam, sir.

42:30.041 --> 42:32.500
Everything checks out,

42:30.041 --> 42:32.500
but we're getting no results.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.041
God has prevented

42:32.500 --> 42:35.041
your escape.

42:35.041 --> 42:36.875
Then your God

42:35.041 --> 42:36.875
is unfair.

42:36.875 --> 42:39.625
My son had no warning

42:36.875 --> 42:39.625
that his act was criminal.

42:39.625 --> 42:42.333
We cannot allow

42:39.625 --> 42:42.333
ignorance of the law

42:42.333 --> 42:43.875
to become a defense.

42:43.875 --> 42:46.542
I don't know how

42:43.875 --> 42:46.542
to communicate this,

42:46.542 --> 42:48.709
or even if it is possible,

42:48.709 --> 42:52.125
but the question of justice has

42:48.709 --> 42:52.125
concerned me greatly of late.

42:52.125 --> 42:54.750
And I say to any creature

42:52.125 --> 42:54.750
who may be listening,

42:54.750 --> 42:57.959
there can be no justice

42:54.750 --> 42:57.959
so long as laws are absolute.

42:59.375 --> 43:01.792
Even life itself

43:01.792 --> 43:04.542
is an exercise in exceptions.

43:04.542 --> 43:08.375
When has justice ever been

43:04.542 --> 43:08.375
as simple as a rule book?

43:11.542 --> 43:14.792
Seems the Edo Lord agrees

43:11.542 --> 43:14.792
with you, Number One.

43:25.834 --> 43:27.750
Main viewer on.

43:32.875 --> 43:35.125
Hailing frequencies.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.834
Open, sir.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.375
To the object in orbit with us.

43:40.375 --> 43:43.667
We will remove

43:40.375 --> 43:43.667
the human colonists

43:43.667 --> 43:45.583
from the adjoining solar system

43:45.583 --> 43:47.667
if you signal us

43:45.583 --> 43:47.667
to do so.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.709
Please tell us.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.000
Captain.

43:58.834 --> 44:00.750
Is that a signal?

44:00.750 --> 44:03.166
I suppose...

44:03.166 --> 44:05.291
I suppose it must be.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.333
I was hoping for more.

44:07.333 --> 44:09.667
More of what, sir?

44:09.667 --> 44:11.542
I'm glad it's gone.

44:11.542 --> 44:14.583
Agreed, sir,

44:11.542 --> 44:14.583
short and sweet.

44:14.583 --> 44:16.417
Godlike efficiency.

44:16.417 --> 44:20.083
I was hoping we might learn

44:16.417 --> 44:20.083
more about it,

44:20.083 --> 44:23.125
but since we can't,

44:23.125 --> 44:25.333
take us out of here,

44:23.125 --> 44:25.333
Number One.

44:25.333 --> 44:27.750
Gladly, sir.
