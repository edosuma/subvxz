00:02.169 --> 00:03.044
[Twilight]<i> Princess Celestia,</i>

00:03.086 --> 00:05.840
<i>I have an idea for</i>

00:03.086 --> 00:05.840
<i>your Onesversary!</i>

00:05.881 --> 00:08.049
My... Onesversary?

00:08.091 --> 00:10.678
The one thousand one hundred

00:08.091 --> 00:10.678
eleventh year anniversary

00:10.719 --> 00:12.262
of when you first

00:10.719 --> 00:12.262
raised the sun.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.055
Good thing Pinkie

00:12.304 --> 00:14.055
Pie reminded us,

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
or we woulda forgot

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
to celebrate!

00:16.099 --> 00:17.935
You're not the only ones.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.186
What did you have in mind?

00:19.227 --> 00:23.022
To commemorate your first

00:19.227 --> 00:23.022
sunrise, I've written a play.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.066
We'd like to perform it at

00:23.064 --> 00:25.066
my School of Friendship.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.067
If you don't mind.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.070
[excited laugh] Ooh!

00:29.112 --> 00:30.071
Mind?

00:30.113 --> 00:32.032
Oh, of course not!

00:32.073 --> 00:35.953
Oh, I think a play

00:32.073 --> 00:35.953
is a fantastic idea!

00:35.995 --> 00:38.246
Did she just...

00:35.995 --> 00:38.246
prance?

00:38.288 --> 00:41.750
Oh. Forgive me for

00:38.288 --> 00:41.750
getting so excited.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.251
I-it's just...

00:43.293 --> 00:47.088
When I was a filly, my

00:43.293 --> 00:47.088
friends often put on plays.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.092
Oh, it was so wonderful,

00:47.130 --> 00:51.092
everypony coming together

00:51.134 --> 00:54.847
to create a magical experience

00:51.134 --> 00:54.847
to share with others.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.058
I've always believed theatre

00:54.889 --> 00:58.058
brings out the best in us,

00:58.099 --> 01:00.519
and forges a special

00:58.099 --> 01:00.519
bond of friendship.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.520
[gasp]

01:01.562 --> 01:04.064
I didn't know you used to act.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.691
Oh, not me.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.985
I was always too busy

01:05.733 --> 01:07.985
with my magic lessons

01:08.027 --> 01:10.111
to be part of any

01:08.027 --> 01:10.111
plays myself.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.741
But still, it's something

01:10.153 --> 01:13.741
I always wished

01:13.782 --> 01:15.116
I could experience.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.911
And you still can!

01:16.952 --> 01:18.245
Princess Celestia...

01:18.286 --> 01:21.081
we would be honored if you

01:18.286 --> 01:21.081
would be the star of our play!

You want me to

02:03.331 --> 02:06.209
Yeah, when did that

02:03.331 --> 02:06.209
happen exactly?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.128
If you'll excuse

02:06.251 --> 02:08.128
us for a second...

02:09.463 --> 02:10.965
Don't you see, Spike?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.215
It's perfect!

02:12.257 --> 02:14.843
Princess Celestia has always

02:12.257 --> 02:14.843
wanted to be in a play,

02:14.885 --> 02:17.178
and this one's about her!

02:17.220 --> 02:18.472
I guess...

02:18.513 --> 02:20.265
But how are we supposed

02:18.513 --> 02:20.265
to give her directions?

02:20.307 --> 02:22.183
She's the ruler of Equestria!

02:22.225 --> 02:23.978
She's also our friend.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.354
Celestia's always

02:24.019 --> 02:26.354
kind to everypony.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.357
So if we have a chance to

02:26.396 --> 02:29.357
finally do something for her,

02:29.399 --> 02:30.609
we should!

02:31.151 --> 02:32.193
Hmmm.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.155
C'mon, how many

02:32.235 --> 02:35.155
times has Celestia

02:32.235 --> 02:35.155
helped us?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.197
Guided us.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
Been a warm calming

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
voice over our shoulder--

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
[startled gasps]

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
Twilight?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
Yes, Princess Celestia?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.288
Your invitation

02:41.244 --> 02:43.288
is very kind.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.332
But are you certain

02:43.330 --> 02:45.332
it's wise?

02:45.373 --> 02:48.376
I have no acting

02:45.373 --> 02:48.376
experience at all.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
Experience? Pssh!

02:50.253 --> 02:52.089
You'll be playing yourself.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.172
And we'll all help you.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.842
Please?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.301
It'd mean so much

02:54.883 --> 02:56.301
to the students

02:56.343 --> 02:58.095
if you were in our show.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.139
Well, if you're sure...

03:02.307 --> 03:04.309
Yeah, what she said.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.729
Then I would be delighted

03:04.351 --> 03:07.729
to join your theatre troupe!

03:08.313 --> 03:09.188
Whoo hoo!

03:11.942 --> 03:13.234
Confetti is ready!

03:13.276 --> 03:15.194
Hoo hoo!

03:15.236 --> 03:17.196
Wormy applecores, Pinkie!

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
How many times have I told ya

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
to keep your special effects

03:19.366 --> 03:21.409
away from my sets?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.037
Three hundred twenty-seven.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.830
Ooh! Unless you just DID.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.998
Then it's three

03:24.872 --> 03:25.998
hundred twenty-eight!

03:26.874 --> 03:28.249
Ugh.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.003
I can't believe you've memorized

03:28.291 --> 03:31.003
your lines already, Fluttershy.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.421
Once you get past terrifying,

03:31.045 --> 03:33.421
paralyzing stage fright,

03:33.463 --> 03:35.174
the rest is easy.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.341
Now I just hope

03:35.215 --> 03:36.341
Princess Celestia

03:36.383 --> 03:38.259
says we can do our play.

03:38.301 --> 03:42.097
Oh! As soon as she sees

03:38.301 --> 03:42.097
these fabulous costumes,

03:42.139 --> 03:45.017
all she'll be able

03:42.139 --> 03:45.017
to say is 'brava!'

03:46.894 --> 03:47.728
Heads up!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.021
Here comes our answer.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.107
Wonderful news, everypony!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.483
Yeeeha!

03:53.525 --> 03:55.110
We get to put on our show?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.277
Even better.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.279
Princess Celestia is

03:56.319 --> 03:58.279
gonna be our star!

03:58.530 --> 03:59.907
[gasps]

03:59.948 --> 04:02.201
Yeah, that's how I felt, too.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.870
Celestia? Starring in our play?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.287
This is huge!

04:06.329 --> 04:09.041
Well, she was a little

04:06.329 --> 04:09.041
nervous at first,

04:09.083 --> 04:10.500
but I told her not to worry.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.045
With us helping, it'll

04:10.542 --> 04:13.045
all go smooth as...

04:13.087 --> 04:14.046
Silk!

04:14.088 --> 04:14.922
[zoom]

04:16.215 --> 04:17.549
I must find the silk!

04:17.591 --> 04:19.300
If Celestia is going

04:17.591 --> 04:19.300
to be in our play,

04:19.342 --> 04:22.303
we have to take everything

04:19.342 --> 04:22.303
up to the next level!

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
None of these old

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
ideas will do!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.892
Yeah! Forget my

04:24.932 --> 04:26.892
regular party cannon.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.062
For princess-size effects, we're

04:26.934 --> 04:30.062
gonna need "Big Bertha!"

04:30.104 --> 04:31.312
[crash]

04:31.354 --> 04:33.273
[Applejack] Grrr...  Pinkie!

04:33.565 --> 04:35.067
What?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.568
Our play is gonna be AMAZING!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.319
I gotta tell everypony I know!

04:38.361 --> 04:39.404
And even the ones I don't!

04:39.654 --> 04:42.032
[zoom bang]

04:42.074 --> 04:44.993
Why in tarnation are y'all

04:42.074 --> 04:44.993
gettin' so star-struck?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.121
We've met Princess

04:45.035 --> 04:47.121
Celestia before.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.329
Plenty of times.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.541
Those were formal things,

04:48.371 --> 04:51.541
galas, world-saving.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.585
This is different.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.922
Imagine doing sweaty

04:53.627 --> 04:56.922
warm-ups with a princess.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.258
Blowing your nose in

04:56.964 --> 04:59.258
front of a princess.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.594
Sitting around just...

04:59.299 --> 05:02.594
talking with a princess.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.305
I'm a princess.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.305
You talk to me.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.932
That's different.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.309
You're not a<i> princess</i>

05:06.974 --> 05:09.309
princess.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.937
Uh...  thanks.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.273
Celestia wants to experience

05:11.979 --> 05:14.273
the special friendship

05:14.314 --> 05:15.565
that theatre ponies have.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.193
To give her that, you just

05:15.607 --> 05:18.193
need to be yourselves.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.445
You... you really

05:18.235 --> 05:20.445
think so?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.572
Heh. Aw, quit frettin'.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.908
It's only a coupla

05:22.614 --> 05:24.908
pals gettin' together

05:24.950 --> 05:26.618
to put on a Onesversary play.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.328
What could go wrong?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.705
[Spike] Places, everypony.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.792
We're here to rehearse

05:30.747 --> 05:33.792
"A New Day in Equestria!"

05:34.168 --> 05:35.335
Ahem.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.006
Directed, written, and

05:36.419 --> 05:39.006
produced by Twilight Sparkle.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.926
Page One, Act One, Scene One.

05:42.968 --> 05:43.969
Action!

05:46.680 --> 05:50.100
Once upon a time,

05:46.680 --> 05:50.100
before Celestia,

05:50.142 --> 05:53.270
Equestria was suffering

05:50.142 --> 05:53.270
terrible hardship.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.480
Raising the sun every

05:53.312 --> 05:55.480
morning was so hard,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.398
it took five great sorcerers

05:57.440 --> 06:00.359
plus Starswirl the

05:57.440 --> 06:00.359
Bearded to do it.

06:01.444 --> 06:05.199
[grunts]

06:05.240 --> 06:07.201
[clatter]

06:07.242 --> 06:10.162
And every day, the unicorns

06:07.242 --> 06:10.162
helping Starswirl

06:10.204 --> 06:13.623
would use so much magic,

06:10.204 --> 06:13.623
they lost their powers...

06:13.665 --> 06:15.374
forever!

06:15.416 --> 06:17.336
Things looked bleak.

06:17.376 --> 06:21.215
Soon, Equestria would

06:17.376 --> 06:21.215
lose all its magic-users!

06:21.256 --> 06:25.969
Then, the land would be covered

06:21.256 --> 06:25.969
in darkness for eternity.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.556
[clatter]

06:29.597 --> 06:32.142
Even I can't believe

06:29.597 --> 06:32.142
how good my play is.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.270
The sets, the props, the

06:32.184 --> 06:35.270
outfits, they're all great!

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
And, here comes

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
the best part.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.442
But then, a student named

06:37.731 --> 06:41.442
Celestia discovered she had the

06:41.484 --> 06:46.447
power to raise the sun herself,

06:41.484 --> 06:46.447
without draining her magic!

06:46.489 --> 06:49.117
[birds chirping]

06:49.159 --> 06:51.578
Um... that's your

06:49.159 --> 06:51.578
cue, Celestia.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.289
Oh! Right! Of course.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.456
Ahe-heh-hem.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
[soft and awkward]

06:56.499 --> 07:01.088
It is time for a new

06:56.499 --> 07:01.088
day in Equestria.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.422
Um. What?

07:03.464 --> 07:04.591
Oh, uh, I said...

07:04.632 --> 07:09.470
It is time for a new
