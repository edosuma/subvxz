WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.468
Here you go.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.836
Your favorite PJs are ready

00:04.938 --> 00:07.105
- for your first sleepover!
- What?

00:07.207 --> 00:09.101
I told you I never want
to go on a sleepover.

00:09.182 --> 00:11.049
Which is why I'm telling you
at the last second!

00:11.151 --> 00:13.017
I didn't want to hear you
complain all week.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.386
What if they make me
sleep next to an outlet

00:15.455 --> 00:18.623
and I roll over and my pinky
goes in and I get electrocuted?

00:18.725 --> 00:22.760
Then you're crying, "Why?
Why did I make my baby go?"

00:22.862 --> 00:23.895
You are going.

00:23.963 --> 00:27.098
You are too old to keep
dodging sleepovers.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.634
"She was so little!"

00:30.937 --> 00:32.770
- Still reading exams?
- Yep,

00:32.839 --> 00:35.039
I have to get through these
50 essays this weekend.

00:35.108 --> 00:37.208
It's exciting to see how
students do under pressure.

00:37.277 --> 00:38.910
Some struggle, but others soar!

00:38.978 --> 00:41.446
That's probably because
you're such a great teacher,

00:41.548 --> 00:42.947
mentor and father.

00:43.016 --> 00:45.049
Whatever it is, I agree with Mom.

00:45.118 --> 00:46.184
Please, Daddy!

00:46.286 --> 00:48.186
Mama wants me to go to a sleepover!

00:48.288 --> 00:49.620
Anna-Kat, that's not true.

00:49.689 --> 00:52.190
I am forcing you to go to a sleepover.

00:52.225 --> 00:54.125
You know Oliver only
cares about himself,

00:54.194 --> 00:56.094
so if you alienate me,

00:56.162 --> 00:59.564
all you'll be left with is
Taylor to take care of you.

00:59.666 --> 01:01.165
Not smart, Mama.

01:03.737 --> 01:05.036
Hi!

01:05.105 --> 01:06.838
Ugh, trade.

01:07.941 --> 01:09.307
Ah, ooh.

01:09.409 --> 01:10.641
Hey, Violet.

01:10.744 --> 01:11.909
Oh.

01:11.945 --> 01:13.644
What happened to your hair?

01:13.747 --> 01:15.546
I can't afford to be blonde anymore.

01:15.648 --> 01:17.482
Pretty soon I'll be buying
second-hand clothes

01:17.584 --> 01:20.218
from garage sales like... this.

01:20.286 --> 01:21.919
- Ugh.
- I'll have you know

01:21.988 --> 01:23.855
I won this at Dave & Buster's.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.623
700 tickets.

01:25.692 --> 01:29.293
You know, I love Violet so much,
but being a mom is so hard.

01:29.396 --> 01:30.795
Why didn't anyone warn me?

01:30.864 --> 01:32.864
You can hear me screaming
at my kids from your house

01:32.932 --> 01:35.967
ten times a day.
Isn't that warning enough?

01:36.069 --> 01:38.102
Can I help you find something?

01:38.204 --> 01:39.270
You know it's just me over there

01:39.339 --> 01:41.472
in that giant house all by myself.

01:41.574 --> 01:42.774
I can't afford a nanny,

01:42.876 --> 01:44.108
Pilates is too expensive

01:44.144 --> 01:46.110
so now I'm breastfeeding to lose weight.

01:46.179 --> 01:48.146
I ballooned up to a size four.

01:49.516 --> 01:51.416
Katie, your screaming pillow.

01:51.518 --> 01:52.784
Excuse me.

01:56.122 --> 01:58.356
See, you have Greg to help you

01:58.425 --> 02:00.825
with everything, especially the kids.

02:00.894 --> 02:03.060
Who's got the sweetest nosey

02:03.129 --> 02:04.295
on your face-face?

02:04.397 --> 02:06.164
- You do!
- And on the plus side,

02:06.266 --> 02:08.366
his baby talk doubles as birth control.

02:11.538 --> 02:12.670
Viv, I know you're a little broke,

02:12.772 --> 02:14.906
but you can't steal groceries
from my house.

02:14.974 --> 02:17.341
Hilarious, I love it!

02:17.444 --> 02:18.910
I don't know, Katie.

02:18.978 --> 02:23.381
I just... feel like I can't do
this alone anymore.

02:23.416 --> 02:26.017
Do you guys think that you could
watch Violet for me tonight?

02:26.119 --> 02:27.251
We'd love to!

02:27.353 --> 02:28.820
Why are we watching the baby tonight?

02:28.922 --> 02:31.923
I am headed to Mario's
down by the train station

02:31.991 --> 02:34.492
where all the divorced investment
bankers go after work.

02:34.594 --> 02:35.927
I think I can snag one

02:35.995 --> 02:37.995
if I get there before all
the tramps take the good seats.

02:38.097 --> 02:40.298
- What are the good seats?
- Ooh.

02:40.366 --> 02:42.099
The barstools at the end.

02:42.202 --> 02:43.935
That way I can do this...

02:46.906 --> 02:48.439
...without hitting anybody.

03:03.022 --> 03:04.989
Are those my earrings?

03:05.091 --> 03:06.190
These are so nice!

03:06.259 --> 03:07.959
- Can I borrow them?
- No.

03:08.061 --> 03:10.595
I wore them to a business dinner
but saved the receipt.

03:10.697 --> 03:12.730
- I'm returning them.
- No wonder I like them more

03:12.832 --> 03:14.632
than the rest of your trash...
Treasures!

03:14.734 --> 03:16.067
Off now.

03:16.169 --> 03:17.134
They're expensive

03:17.236 --> 03:18.636
and if I don't return them by tomorrow

03:18.705 --> 03:20.538
then I will be stuck with a store credit

03:20.640 --> 03:22.607
that expires the day before I find it

03:22.709 --> 03:24.976
in a drawer with the extension cords.

03:30.350 --> 03:31.682
Ugh, news again.

03:31.784 --> 03:33.718
That's it. I'm deleting this app.

03:36.389 --> 03:37.388
No.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.056
No no no no no no!

03:39.158 --> 03:41.926
Bad dog! Luthor, sit!

03:41.995 --> 03:44.962
Now Luthor, reverse swallow.

03:45.064 --> 03:46.464
Reverse swallow!

03:47.934 --> 03:49.200
Okay, practice run.

03:49.302 --> 03:50.568
When the mom says to go to sleep,

03:50.670 --> 03:53.337
you take your sleeping bag
and put it next to the bathroom

03:53.439 --> 03:55.840
just in case you want
to wash your hands a few times.

03:55.942 --> 03:58.009
Yeah, Mama, if you
want me to get covered

03:58.111 --> 04:00.111
in sewer water when a pipe bursts.

04:00.213 --> 04:02.780
- That is not gonna...
- Mama, I dunno.

04:02.882 --> 04:05.049
This is all happening so fast, Mama.

04:05.151 --> 04:06.584
You don't have to keep saying "Mama."

04:06.686 --> 04:07.952
I know who you're talking to.

04:08.054 --> 04:09.820
If you have any problems, call us.

04:09.922 --> 04:11.422
No matter how late.

04:11.524 --> 04:12.657
Even if you just want to talk.

04:12.759 --> 04:13.924
A word, Greg?

04:16.829 --> 04:18.663
As the years go on, coming into
this room alone with you

04:18.765 --> 04:20.697
has become more scary than sexy.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.833
Why are you coddling her?

04:22.935 --> 04:24.935
She needs a push right now, not a hug.

04:25.004 --> 04:26.570
She's nervous. She's our baby...

04:26.673 --> 04:28.239
She is turning 10!

04:28.341 --> 04:32.276
And this is our opportunity
to help her grow up a little.

04:32.378 --> 04:33.644
I need this.

04:33.713 --> 04:35.513
I am getting "Mama" 'd
to death in there.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.181
What's your hurry to make her grow up?

04:37.250 --> 04:38.849
- She's our last one.
- Exactly.

04:38.951 --> 04:41.052
We're on the verge of
getting our lives back.

04:41.154 --> 04:42.720
Not if we take action.

04:42.789 --> 04:44.321
Let's have another baby.

04:47.026 --> 04:48.693
Can you get my screaming pillow?

04:48.728 --> 04:50.661
I'm sad our kids are getting big.

04:50.763 --> 04:52.530
I miss reading them books,

04:52.598 --> 04:54.231
they reach for your hand,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.200
I miss the way they mispronounce words.

04:56.269 --> 04:57.802
Taylor still does it, but it's not cute.

04:57.904 --> 04:59.103
- It's more worrisome.
- Mm-hmm.

04:59.205 --> 05:00.838
Playing with Viv's baby today

05:00.873 --> 05:02.640
made me want to start all over again.

05:02.742 --> 05:05.476
Well then I wish you and your
second wife the very best.

05:09.749 --> 05:11.549
I can't go to the sleepover, Mama.

05:11.617 --> 05:13.284
I think I'm getting my period.

05:13.386 --> 05:15.086
- No, you're not.
- I'm telling you.

05:15.188 --> 05:16.987
I can feel my uterine wall loosening.

05:17.056 --> 05:19.390
Stop Googling stuff
and go pack your bag!

05:26.632 --> 05:27.932
Can I ask you a favor?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.333
- I need...
- Not my problem.

05:29.435 --> 05:30.468
This is serious.

05:30.570 --> 05:32.870
Then it's seriously not my problem.

05:32.972 --> 05:34.638
That's good stuff.

05:34.741 --> 05:37.374
I turned around and Luthor ate
Mom's expensive earrings.

05:38.444 --> 05:39.810
You're in so much trouble.

05:39.912 --> 05:41.278
I read online it can take a dog a month

05:41.380 --> 05:42.613
to pass something like this.

05:42.715 --> 05:43.981
But I need them by tomorrow.

05:44.016 --> 05:45.983
- What do I do?
- Oh, I know.

05:46.085 --> 05:47.651
Leave me out of it.

05:47.754 --> 05:49.019
I am on fire.

05:49.122 --> 05:50.721
You're always calling me the dumb one.

05:50.823 --> 05:52.523
So I'm dumb. Help me!

05:52.592 --> 05:54.725
All right, all right, I'll help you.

05:54.827 --> 05:57.027
Don't forget to wear gloves.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.262
Three for three!

06:04.370 --> 06:07.338
Viv, did you steal my car keys
so I'd come over?

06:08.441 --> 06:09.306
No.

06:11.144 --> 06:12.343
Yes.

06:12.445 --> 06:13.611
But, hey,

06:13.679 --> 06:15.379
would you just stay
and talk to me for, like,

06:15.481 --> 06:17.081
ten minutes about anything adult?

06:17.183 --> 06:18.482
Look, just pick a topic.

06:18.551 --> 06:20.050
Is this my magazine?

06:20.153 --> 06:22.153
Did you take this from my bathroom?

06:22.255 --> 06:23.621
I left my phone in the bedroom

06:23.689 --> 06:25.623
and had to read the shampoo
bottle like an animal!

06:26.726 --> 06:28.726
- Hi, Viv.
- Alan?!

06:29.829 --> 06:31.428
How the hell did you get in here?

06:31.531 --> 06:33.831
I opened the door
with the light of my soul.

06:33.933 --> 06:36.267
And my key... I still have
my key, and it works.

06:36.369 --> 06:38.536
This isn't your home anymore, Alan.

06:38.604 --> 06:41.238
You and Viv are divorced.
She kicked you out a year ago.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.773
I know, and I deserved that.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.509
And in that time,
I've been in an ashram in India.

06:45.611 --> 06:46.877
I've been meditating.

06:46.946 --> 06:49.446
I've been finding myself,
reading other people's auras.

06:49.549 --> 06:51.482
Yours, by the way, is very cloudy.

06:51.584 --> 06:52.983
That's not good.

06:53.052 --> 06:54.752
You might want to have that looked at.

06:54.854 --> 06:56.487
What do you want, Alan?

06:56.556 --> 06:58.756
Listen, Viv, I wasn't
the greatest husband.

06:58.858 --> 07:00.124
But I want us to have a fresh start.

07:00.226 --> 07:03.460
And I realize you are
the most important thing,

07:03.563 --> 07:05.496
and if you take me back this time,

07:05.565 --> 07:07.398
I will give you everything
you deserve...

07:07.500 --> 07:09.166
champagne, travel...

07:09.268 --> 07:11.068
I will teach you to levitate.

07:14.207 --> 07:16.006
Did you see that? It's very subtle.

07:16.075 --> 07:19.410
I really would like to believe
that you've changed.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.979
Let me show you that I've changed.

07:22.081 --> 07:25.783
If you take me back, I'll make
sure your energy is pure

07:25.885 --> 07:28.686
and your sandals are Prada.

07:28.788 --> 07:32.656
Nice try, Alan, but Viv
doesn't need you anymore.

07:32.758 --> 07:35.292
She is a strong, independent woman...

07:35.394 --> 07:37.528
- Um, actually...
- No, Viv.

07:37.630 --> 07:38.996
- Um, actually, again.
- Viv!

07:39.098 --> 07:40.796
- Katie.
- You do not need a man

07:40.866 --> 07:41.827
to make you happy.

07:41.905 --> 07:45.035
Viv, it's just us this time...
you and me.

07:45.137 --> 07:47.671
A-All my children are in prep school,

07:47.773 --> 07:49.940
so there'll be no kids
to come between us.

07:51.344 --> 07:52.776
Whose baby is that?

07:52.879 --> 07:54.311
Katie's!

07:54.413 --> 07:56.213
Congratulations, Katie.

07:56.315 --> 07:57.882
"Namaste."

07:57.950 --> 07:59.944
That's a really neat phrase I learned.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.906
It means "amazeballs."

08:04.500 --> 08:06.773
Everything's gonna be just
like it was only better.

08:06.845 --> 08:08.879
- Oh.
- I'm getting so healthy right now,

08:08.981 --> 08:11.481
- I'm practically peeing essential oils.
- Oh.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.051
- And you will, too.
- I can't wait.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.086
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go fill our toilet

08:16.188 --> 08:17.654
with eucalyptus and ylang-ylang.

08:17.723 --> 08:18.922
Mmm.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.292
My baby?

08:22.361 --> 08:24.194
I don't know.
It was all I could think of.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.163
She's your baby, Viv!

08:26.265 --> 08:27.977
Of course she is! I'm just...

08:28.040 --> 08:30.774
Giving up your baby for a shot
with your terrible ex-husband?

08:30.876 --> 08:32.543
No, not giving her up,

08:32.611 --> 08:35.846
just buying time to see if Alan
and I can work it out.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.313
He's going to have to know about her.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.049
She is not a banjo
you can store in my basement.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.352
Did I used to own a banjo?

08:41.419 --> 08:43.520
No, it could be anything.
It's a figure of speech!

08:43.589 --> 08:45.122
- Well I don't understand it.
- Viv!

08:45.191 --> 08:48.359
Katie, please,
just watch Violet for the night.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.594
Then Alan and I will be back together,

08:50.663 --> 08:52.396
and I promise I will come clean.

08:52.498 --> 08:53.897
By then he'll be so in love with me

08:53.999 --> 08:55.666
he'll have to be in love with her.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.102
- This is a bad idea.
- Please?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.194
Being a single mom is so hard.

09:00.272 --> 09:01.939
And I want my blond hair back.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.741
Brunettes lead sad, miserable lives.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.776
You of all people should
understand that.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.114
Hey. Why'd you want my old...

09:10.182 --> 09:12.349
Oh, hell no!

09:12.451 --> 09:14.051
You had another one?!

09:14.120 --> 09:15.953
Do they just drop
out of you without warning?

09:16.055 --> 09:17.621
It is Viv's baby.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.823
I did not have time to
grab a stroller from her.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.292
Why would you want to babysit Viv's baby?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.861
Alan is back

09:23.929 --> 09:25.863
so I'm stuck taking care
of little Viv here

09:25.931 --> 09:28.599
until she can get up the guts
to tell Alan she had a baby.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.968
Since when do you do such
nice things for people?

09:31.036 --> 09:31.902
I don't know.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.238
I'm losing what makes me special.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.573
The worst part is having this
little angel at our house

09:36.675 --> 09:38.108
is making Greg baby crazy.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.477
And I do not want another baby.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.179
Sometimes the best cure
for wanting a baby

09:42.214 --> 09:43.647
is spending time with a baby.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.748
Yeah, it's true.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.750
Make Greg watch the baby all night.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.485
- See how he likes it then.
- Mm-hmm.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.387
I always say, if you want to
talk someone out of marriage,

09:50.456 --> 09:52.389
just hang out with my ex-wife.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.979
What does that have to do with the baby?

09:54.003 --> 09:55.012
I don't know,

09:55.037 --> 09:56.570
I just feel like we don't
talk about me enough.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.969
Ready for your sleepover?

10:06.038 --> 10:07.871
It was nice knowing you, boy.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.308
You with your shorter life span,
and here I am going first.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.377
You will be home tomorrow morning.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.945
Get in the car.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.059
Here you go, Professor.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.360
Katie, I'm working.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.862
Not anymore.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.598
Oh, is having a baby
sometimes inconvenient?

10:34.700 --> 10:35.999
Good thing she's not a toddler,

10:36.068 --> 10:38.302
because toddlers do stuff like this.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.117
You know how you said the dog

10:54.220 --> 10:56.386
eating Mom's earrings
wasn't your problem?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.554
Yeah, that was great.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.122
And remember those gold cufflinks

10:59.225 --> 11:00.257
that you got from Spencer?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.558
You mean the ones that he stole

11:01.627 --> 11:03.794
off Malcolm Forbes' corpse
at his funeral?

11:03.863 --> 11:05.329
Right, those.

11:05.397 --> 11:07.064
Well, now we have the same problem

11:07.166 --> 11:08.599
because Luthor ate them.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.237
How'd Luthor get them?!

11:13.339 --> 11:14.938
Well, they somehow fell into a treat.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.074
That I fed him. And then I laughed.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.076
Now grab some gloves and join the party.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.382
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.351
I am back from dropping Anna-Kat off.

11:28.654 --> 11:29.853
Where is Violet?

11:29.955 --> 11:33.090
She's napping in my office
like an angel.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.424
- Is she?
- Yeah.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.026
Hmm.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.904
Why are you putting
loose change in the blender?

11:46.972 --> 11:49.039
You need to sharpen the blades
every six months.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.908
You are not staying on top of it.

11:50.976 --> 11:51.909
I don't think tha...

11:53.779 --> 11:55.279
You'll wake the baby!

11:55.347 --> 11:56.847
Oh, is she sleeping?!

11:56.949 --> 11:58.315
I forgot she was even here!

11:58.384 --> 12:00.183
We were just talking about her!

12:09.361 --> 12:10.727
Why isn't she crying?

12:10.796 --> 12:12.996
She's so calm.
I forgot how good babies can be.

12:13.098 --> 12:13.931
Oh.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.600
Such a good baby!

12:16.702 --> 12:19.202
<i>Let's see how good
you are when I do this.</i>

12:25.844 --> 12:27.411
I better clean this pacifier.

12:27.479 --> 12:28.812
Newborns are the best.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.083
<i>You've made a powerful enemy, baby.</i>

12:37.523 --> 12:39.256
Anna-Kat, are you okay?

12:39.358 --> 12:40.457
You were so right.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.160
- The sleepover is fun.
- See?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.162
But we're having
a stuffed animal tea party

12:45.264 --> 12:47.064
and I didn't bring one.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.766
I'm going to be stuck using
an oven mitt like an idiot.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.535
Okay, calm down. I'll be right there.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.936
Bring my stuffed turtle.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.671
The one with the friendly eyes.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.707
Not the one who looks like
he has a terrible secret.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.475
How am I supposed to figure that out?

12:58.577 --> 12:59.676
You'll know.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.625
What do you know, turtle?

13:16.295 --> 13:18.161
Mama!

13:19.898 --> 13:21.698
- Here's your turtle.
- Forget the turtle.

13:21.734 --> 13:22.776
Let's get out of here.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.901
Wait, what about the tea party?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.637
There was never any tea party.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.372
Let me get my things,
and I'll explain in the car.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're not getting your things.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.309
Good thinking. Leave 'em here.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.511
- Collateral damage.
- No.

13:34.613 --> 13:35.979
Just because something is hard

13:36.048 --> 13:37.848
does not mean you run away from it.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.117
This is an opportunity
for you to make friends

13:40.219 --> 13:41.818
with some nice girls.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.720
I am not taking you home.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.224
Kids, it's time to
decorate your own cupcake!

13:47.326 --> 13:49.292
I'm in hell.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.366
Viv?

13:56.468 --> 13:57.801
What are you doing here?

13:57.836 --> 14:00.103
Other than breastfeeding and
making Greg uncomfortable.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.171
I couldn't figure out

14:01.240 --> 14:02.773
a way of getting past her
without looking.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.307
Before I go out with Alan for the night,

14:04.410 --> 14:07.010
I had to feed my sweet,
beautiful Violet.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.146
This is always the best part of my day.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.480
Mm.

14:10.582 --> 14:13.350
I remember when I had
best parts of my day.

14:13.452 --> 14:14.618
All right, Viv.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.919
The car's out...

14:16.021 --> 14:18.455
Why are you breastfeeding Katie's baby?

14:18.557 --> 14:20.624
- Uh...
- When you left Viv,

14:20.726 --> 14:25.328
she became so poor that... I had
to hire her... as my wet nurse.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.797
That's... right.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.131
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:28.233 --> 14:31.735
Um, Katie is just one of
my many clients that I wet for.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.871
I-I'm not an idiot, okay?

14:34.973 --> 14:36.606
Okay, Alan...

14:38.043 --> 14:39.309
...Violet's my baby.

14:39.423 --> 14:41.445
Since we've been divorced,
you had a baby?

14:41.547 --> 14:42.979
Alan, what you have to understand...

14:43.082 --> 14:44.881
[Bleep] I looked.

14:46.564 --> 14:48.134
And the father was a pig whisperer,

14:48.213 --> 14:49.820
he caught me at a very vulnerable time.

14:49.906 --> 14:52.523
But then he left town and
I never heard from him again.

14:52.578 --> 14:54.632
Well, the "old me" would've
dumped you immediately.

14:54.687 --> 14:57.272
But Swami Gary's taught me
to think before I act.

14:57.341 --> 14:58.807
He calls it "thacting."

14:58.874 --> 15:00.774
What other vocab did
Swami Gary teach you?

15:00.876 --> 15:02.309
Douching, by chance?

15:02.411 --> 15:04.711
As in, the act of being a douche?

15:04.813 --> 15:07.047
Here's my offer... we're gonna
Westport the whole situation.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.082
We're gonna hire
an entire staff of nannies.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.251
They're gonna care for her.
They're gonna feed her.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.893
They're gonna take her
to tennis lessons, okay?

15:12.925 --> 15:13.864
When she's old enough,

15:13.889 --> 15:15.589
we're gonna get her into
a Swiss boarding school.

15:15.691 --> 15:17.157
And then you and I
will live our lives...

15:17.226 --> 15:18.425
our big, awesome, amazing lives,

15:18.494 --> 15:20.460
and you are gonna want for nothing.

15:20.562 --> 15:22.729
Um...

15:22.831 --> 15:24.331
- I...
- Viv?

15:24.433 --> 15:27.167
I'll be in the car, okay?

15:27.269 --> 15:29.002
Amazeballs.

15:29.104 --> 15:31.171
Means "namaste," essentially.

15:33.175 --> 15:34.775
Okay, before you say anything,

15:34.843 --> 15:36.376
maybe it is a good plan.

15:36.445 --> 15:37.711
Maybe Violet will be better off.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.446
- Viv...
- And you'll be better off!

15:39.548 --> 15:41.048
I won't be here all the time

15:41.116 --> 15:43.150
bothering you, taking your stuff,

15:43.218 --> 15:45.252
showering at your place
when you guys are gone.

15:45.321 --> 15:47.321
It took you so long
to leave on Thursday.

15:47.389 --> 15:48.755
- Oh.
- Greg?

15:48.857 --> 15:49.923
A word?

16:00.102 --> 16:01.668
I called the vet, and they said pumpkin

16:01.737 --> 16:04.271
will make him go immediately,
so I fed him a can and a half.

16:04.373 --> 16:05.639
Smart.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.174
Come on, boy! Give us some earrings!

16:07.276 --> 16:08.975
And cufflinks...
don't forget the cufflinks.

16:09.078 --> 16:10.777
Whoa, whoa. He needs his space.

16:12.081 --> 16:13.914
Ooh, I think he's ready to go.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.148
How can you tell?

16:15.250 --> 16:16.249
It looks like he's trying to solve

16:16.352 --> 16:18.251
a really hard math problem.

16:18.354 --> 16:20.854
Good boy, good boy!

16:24.093 --> 16:25.726
Mom's earrings!

16:27.062 --> 16:28.962
Where are my cufflinks?

16:30.332 --> 16:31.798
Come on, boy.
What else you got in there?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.034
A thimble? A race car?

16:34.136 --> 16:35.669
Well, looks like he got into Monopoly.

16:35.738 --> 16:37.437
Come on, boy. Where are my cufflinks?

16:37.506 --> 16:39.539
Luthor never ate your cufflinks.

16:39.641 --> 16:40.540
He didn't?

16:40.642 --> 16:41.641
Then where are they?

16:41.744 --> 16:43.410
I couldn't feed cufflinks to our dog.

16:43.512 --> 16:44.878
I'm not a monster.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.413
I just needed you to help me.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.620
Really?

16:53.722 --> 16:55.122
You played me?

16:56.492 --> 16:57.924
All new respect.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.260
For the "dumb one,"
that was a pretty smart move.

17:00.362 --> 17:02.429
I think you mean for the "dumb whom,"

17:02.531 --> 17:03.797
that was a pretty smart move.

17:06.201 --> 17:08.300
Here's the problem...

17:08.404 --> 17:11.338
Evil Katie almost
has Viv out of her hair.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.339
She wants fewer people depending on her

17:13.442 --> 17:14.941
so she can have more of a life.

17:15.042 --> 17:18.811
And sending Viv off with Alan
would do that in spades.

17:18.881 --> 17:20.513
But Good Katie knows...

17:20.582 --> 17:23.817
That Viv and her baby belong together.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.619
But Evil Katie is tired of
using Russian dressing

17:26.722 --> 17:29.456
to cover her blemishes because
Viv stole her concealer.

17:29.558 --> 17:31.558
But we're human beings, and...

17:31.660 --> 17:34.227
And... we need to do the right thing.

17:35.564 --> 17:36.897
Fine.

17:36.965 --> 17:39.533
I blame you for making me
a better person.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.134
It's very unpleasant.

17:45.441 --> 17:49.309
Viv, I know that you have told me

17:49.378 --> 17:52.879
that you are not mom material,
but you are wrong.

17:52.981 --> 17:54.648
- I am?
- Yes.

17:54.716 --> 17:57.584
Violet is amazing.

17:57.653 --> 18:00.220
- I tried to make her cry repeatedly today...
- Wait, why would you...

18:00.289 --> 18:02.722
It's not important, Viv.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.891
It's Alan.

18:04.993 --> 18:08.094
You have got the best baby ever.

18:08.163 --> 18:10.764
And there is only one reason for it.

18:10.866 --> 18:14.034
Because she has got the best mom ever.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.169
You really think I'm a good mom?

18:16.271 --> 18:17.537
I know you are.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.839
Ugh!

18:18.941 --> 18:20.340
That is such a relief

18:20.442 --> 18:22.409
because I stole
your "best mom ever" mug,

18:22.511 --> 18:23.777
and I felt really bad about it.

18:23.846 --> 18:25.712
But now I feel like I earned it.

18:26.915 --> 18:27.881
You know what?

18:27.983 --> 18:31.551
I don't need a man to make me happy.

18:33.188 --> 18:35.155
Because you make me happy.

18:36.391 --> 18:37.858
Yes, you do.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.929
Violet, it'll be the two of us
against the world.

18:42.998 --> 18:47.934
It'll be the two of you plus the
Otto family against the world.

18:50.539 --> 18:52.772
I don't need a man.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.912
Because you're my man.

18:55.966 --> 19:01.599
Oh, gosh, you're my big,
strong, burly man.

19:04.419 --> 19:05.819
I could kill Good Katie.

19:05.921 --> 19:07.821
Mm.

19:12.895 --> 19:14.794
Look who I have here.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.464
Oh my God, Greg, she's alive!

19:17.566 --> 19:18.899
She made it through the sleepover

19:19.001 --> 19:20.634
and nothing bad happened!

19:20.736 --> 19:21.768
All right, I get it.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.069
You were right, it was good.

19:23.138 --> 19:25.505
We made S'mores and had
a marshmallow fight.

19:25.607 --> 19:27.674
I'm glad I stayed.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.342
Anna-Kat.

19:29.444 --> 19:31.478
Yeah?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.046
I am proud of you.

19:33.148 --> 19:34.902
Thanks, Mom.

19:34.980 --> 19:35.982
"Mom"?

19:36.084 --> 19:37.450
Yeah, "Mom."

19:37.553 --> 19:38.952
None of the kids say "Mama."

19:39.054 --> 19:40.787
That's for babies.

19:44.426 --> 19:46.893
No more "Mama."

19:46.995 --> 19:48.995
I'm not "Mama" anymore.

19:49.097 --> 19:51.131
I'm now... "Mom."

19:53.468 --> 19:55.035
"Mom."

19:55.137 --> 19:57.070
It's the end of an era.

19:59.107 --> 20:01.641
She was so little.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.578
So... fourth baby?

20:08.216 --> 20:09.282
Nah.

20:09.384 --> 20:11.351
I'm just gonna teach Luthor
to call me "Mama."

20:11.453 --> 20:14.020
I saw a husky do it on the Internet.

20:18.835 --> 20:21.016
I am telling you it is more fun

20:21.102 --> 20:23.023
to steal from restaurants
than your friends.

20:23.094 --> 20:24.226
Okay.

20:24.376 --> 20:26.109
One... two...

20:26.211 --> 20:27.443
three... now!

20:28.866 --> 20:30.700
You're right. And it's always stocked.

20:30.802 --> 20:33.754
I mean, I could never get real
maple syrup at your place,

20:33.817 --> 20:34.778
I mean, 'cause you're always like,

20:34.848 --> 20:36.305
"glug, glug, glug, glug, glug."

20:36.374 --> 20:38.801
When the manager
turns away, grab the ketchup.

20:38.879 --> 20:39.879
Oh, no, no, no.

20:39.923 --> 20:40.922
I've already stolen like

20:41.024 --> 20:42.224
three ketchups from you.

20:42.326 --> 20:45.627
But they have those tiny
hot sauces, and I love those.

20:45.729 --> 20:47.707
- Okay, on three.
- Okay.

20:47.777 --> 20:49.417
One... Two...

20:49.466 --> 20:50.632
Dibs!

20:50.734 --> 20:52.300
- Oh.
- It's taco night tonight.

20:52.402 --> 20:54.436
I'll make it up to you.
Next stop... Starbucks.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.335
When you ask them for almond milk,

20:56.376 --> 20:57.542
they hand you a whole carton.

20:57.608 --> 20:59.492
- So fun!
- Yeah.
