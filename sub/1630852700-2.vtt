WEBVTT

00:11.791 --> 00:13.625
Where are you?

00:13.708 --> 00:14.958
Come with us.

00:18.875 --> 00:19.958
Sweetie.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.958
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:32.041 --> 00:34.500
Get out of here,
you pack of dicks,

00:34.583 --> 00:36.500
before I throw you all in the hole.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.791
Where the hell did that guard come from?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.541
I don't fucking know.
I've never seen him before.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.875
Fuck.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.458
Chauncey?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.833
This Yannick better be real.

00:56.583 --> 00:59.708
Because if not, I won't only kill you.

00:59.791 --> 01:03.625
I will kill your family, your dog
and your goldfish.

01:05.291 --> 01:09.416
Hell, I'll even find your fucking
prom date and kill her too.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.958
<i>You sound hoarse.</i>
<i>Everything okay?</i>

01:22.041 --> 01:23.625
You knew I could morph?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.541
You can morph?
What she talking about?

01:27.500 --> 01:29.375
Chris will help you locate Yannick Mair.

01:29.458 --> 01:32.416
Now that you're in, I used
a commlink to hack into the mainframe.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.250
It shows Yannick in block G,
on the south side of the facility,

01:35.333 --> 01:36.416
past the prison yard.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.041
I can still guide her there
even though she ditched the suit.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.000
No. I will handle it.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.291
Anya, follow the plan.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.500
<i>I am.</i>
<i>I can see the yard from here.</i>

01:44.583 --> 01:46.000
<i>Just be careful.</i>

01:57.375 --> 01:58.375
I'm in.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.083
Found it.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.875
<i>Great. Now find Yannick.</i>

02:28.333 --> 02:29.500
About time.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.166
I'm starving.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.041
Where's Pablo?

02:33.125 --> 02:34.333
Above my pay grade.

02:34.416 --> 02:36.625
Russki? Working as a federal guard?

02:44.291 --> 02:45.125
Talk.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.041
Three of your associates have been killed

02:49.125 --> 02:51.041
or they have been compromised.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.625
-I'm here to help you.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.041
Nobody helps.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.500
They just want.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.458
So, what's in it for Yannick?

02:58.541 --> 02:59.625
Whatever you want.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.333
Nobody can guarantee that.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.458
The CIA can.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.166
Why didn't you say
you were with the Americans?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.916
-I was hired to assess security.
-For what and by whom?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.833
A plan to disrupt the…

03:16.958 --> 03:19.583
-Disrupt the…
-<i>Anya, what's happening?</i>

03:19.666 --> 03:21.416
Shit. They poisoned your food.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.666
<i>They did what?</i>

03:33.500 --> 03:36.000
Fuck! He's dead.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.000
<i>Find his phone.</i>

03:38.083 --> 03:39.625
It must be here somewhere.

03:42.916 --> 03:45.833
<i>Wait, there's a weak signal</i>
<i>from the middle of the room.</i>

03:49.583 --> 03:50.500
Bingo.

04:01.833 --> 04:02.833
Got it.

04:37.416 --> 04:40.083
-You prick.

04:40.666 --> 04:43.708
-In and out in one hour? Bullshit.
-What's wrong with y'all?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.458
There she is.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.541
Chauncey.
Chauncey. Who the hell is that?

04:53.083 --> 04:53.916
Y'all need to chill.

04:55.708 --> 04:56.833
Calm the hell down.

04:56.916 --> 05:01.416
You knew all along
that it was a prison to set me up.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.375
And you lied, again.

05:03.958 --> 05:05.875
You tried to hide the fact
you could body-morph.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.166
But, yes, I knew.
It was all in your files.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.875
So I had no choice
but to make you play your hand.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.166
Fuck you.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.500
Hey, hey. Everybody chill the fuck out.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.375
You find anything back there?

05:18.916 --> 05:20.166
Yannick is dead.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.416
This is his burner phone.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.166
What now?

05:29.250 --> 05:30.708
Who are you supposed to be?

05:31.750 --> 05:35.041
Just a Russian paper pusher.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.791
-You… could call.
-That's enough, Dad, come on.

05:37.875 --> 05:41.791
You really look like somebody else.
I mean, it's pretty incredible.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.583
You have no idea what you've done to me.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.875
Yeah, right. Like I should believe any…

05:57.000 --> 05:57.916
You okay?

05:58.458 --> 06:01.000
-Hey, what's going on back there, man?

06:01.083 --> 06:02.083
Mother of God!

06:09.625 --> 06:11.500
Your vitals
are all back to normal.

06:16.541 --> 06:17.375
You okay?

06:19.500 --> 06:22.250
You tell me. It's all in my file.

06:24.708 --> 06:27.000
You're the only human subject
to ever survive

06:27.083 --> 06:30.208
what the Russians called
"The Yaroslav Program."

06:30.291 --> 06:34.958
It puts an almost unbearable strain
on my internal organs.

06:35.041 --> 06:39.750
It started out as a bio-weapons program
as far back as the '80s under the KGB.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.125
What's it matter?

06:42.333 --> 06:47.625
You need to believe me when I tell you
that I don't know if I can do this again.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.041
Or if I can even sustain it next time.

06:53.666 --> 06:55.000
It's been 20 years.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.833
And after all these years,
you didn't learn a few tricks?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.916
Iron helps replenish me.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.583
But it certainly doesn't
take away the pain.

07:09.416 --> 07:10.250
Sorry.

07:10.333 --> 07:11.416
I doubt that.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.041
What can I do?

07:13.625 --> 07:14.708
Let me go.

07:16.708 --> 07:17.791
I can't do that.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.250
How did you find me?

07:23.583 --> 07:24.458
What's it matter?

07:25.041 --> 07:26.666
Because it's my life.

07:29.458 --> 07:32.708
An ex-Russian intelligence agent
turned private investigator

07:32.791 --> 07:34.750
for black market clientele.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.125
He sold me a lead and I followed it.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.791
Impossible.

07:41.041 --> 07:44.791
I scrubbed everything about my life.
Buried it deep and long.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.125
You'll go crazy trying to figure out
what went wrong.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.333
I'll go even crazier if I don't.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.333
We have a bigger problem right now.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.250
Your daughter.

07:58.625 --> 07:59.458
Fuck.

07:59.541 --> 08:01.000
Becca must be freaking out.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.541
Oh, it's all good.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.791
-We handled it.
-What do you mean you handled it?

08:05.875 --> 08:09.750
Becca started to text you about
your whereabouts, so I had to respond.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.125
How? You don't have my cell phone.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.708
I cloned it. When you was unconscious
back in the safe house.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.458
You're officially on my shit list.

08:17.541 --> 08:18.916
I'm just following orders.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.166
Where have I heard that before?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.708
Regardless, we needed a cover story.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.291
So, I told Becca you decided
to have dinner in Getafe

08:26.375 --> 08:28.208
and missed the last train back to Madrid.

08:28.291 --> 08:29.750
Why didn't I take an Uber?

08:29.833 --> 08:31.250
Your credit card was compromised.

08:31.333 --> 08:35.333
You're getting a new card FedEx'd, so you
had to stay at a small bed-and-breakfast.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.333
And you paid cash.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.875
But the real point is,

08:37.958 --> 08:42.166
if you're going to be successful
in your mission, Becca's gotta go home.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.500
You got kids, Chauncey?

08:47.083 --> 08:48.416
I don't even have a plant.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.083
Well, logic, reason,
whatever you wanna call it,

08:52.166 --> 08:54.125
it all goes out the window
when you have kids.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.166
I'm not following.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.458
I understand the danger
I'm putting myself in

08:58.541 --> 09:01.875
and, along those lines, my daughter.

09:03.166 --> 09:06.291
But the truth is…

09:06.375 --> 09:08.416
she's had a real tough year.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.750
With my divorce and, uh,
<i>Mean Girl</i> shit, you name it.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.041
So, her just being able
to participate in this competition…

09:18.125 --> 09:20.250
I'm telling you,
it means everything to Becca

09:20.333 --> 09:21.916
and I'm not taking that from her.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.708
-No, I'm gonna have to demand--
-Let me worry about my daughter.

09:29.791 --> 09:32.666
-If this becomes a distraction--
-I said I'll handle it.

09:48.166 --> 09:51.000
When this is all over,
do I get to go back to my real life?

09:52.500 --> 09:53.416
I don't know.

09:55.958 --> 09:56.916
I figured.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.375
-Thanks.
-For what?

09:59.458 --> 10:00.458
The truth.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.708
No. She's not home.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
She was supposed to be back last night
and then she… I don't know.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.250
I literally don't know
where she is.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.250
No. She sent me three texts
last night and then nothing.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.375
-No. I mean…

10:24.000 --> 10:25.958
Maddie, I need to call you back.

10:26.041 --> 10:27.541
What the fuck, Mom?

10:28.208 --> 10:29.166
It's okay.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.958
"Okay"? I left you in bed last night
after you'd already disappeared once,

10:33.041 --> 10:35.625
thinking you were jet-lagged
and you'd sleep it off,

10:35.708 --> 10:37.875
only to come home
and find your room trashed

10:37.958 --> 10:39.750
like you had Cardi B over
for a girls' night.

10:39.833 --> 10:40.708
I'm sorry.

10:40.791 --> 10:45.083
I didn't clean up and it was
an irresponsible, last-minute thing to do.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.166
And I had to hurry.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.125
Right. Before or after you downed
a dozen bottles of booze?

10:49.208 --> 10:51.500
Oh, those little bottles?

10:51.583 --> 10:53.791
Don't be silly.
Those make up one real glass.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.333
And I accidentally knocked over a couple,
they spilled out--

10:56.416 --> 10:59.000
Plus, you missed the train,
had spotty cell service

10:59.083 --> 11:00.958
and your credit card was compromised?

11:01.041 --> 11:03.500
Yes. But, luckily,

11:04.083 --> 11:06.958
I got to stay at this
tiny bed-and-breakfast

11:07.583 --> 11:11.250
operated by this lovely little old couple,
Pablo and Lucía.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.375
And your hair?

11:13.458 --> 11:14.750
Um…

11:14.833 --> 11:18.291
-Oh, I needed a change, you know.
-No, I don't, Mom.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.000
Are those my fricking clothes?

11:21.083 --> 11:22.583
Yeah. I didn't think you'd mind.

11:22.666 --> 11:25.791
Please tell me. Are you having
one of those… What do you call them?

11:25.875 --> 11:28.416
-A midlife crisis?
-Nervous fucking breakdown!

11:28.500 --> 11:31.000
No! No. No, I'm not.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.708
Hey, are you hungry?
Because I'm absolutely starving.

11:34.791 --> 11:37.791
Right. That has nothing to do
with what we're talking about right now.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.333
Why don't we go downstairs
and get one of those little…

11:40.416 --> 11:42.208
Um, what do you call them? Empanadas?

11:42.750 --> 11:45.791
But let me change my bra first.
This one's killing me.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.083
What is it you girls say now,
"Free the nipple"?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.083
-Oh, my God. Don't say that again.
-Because it is your whole tit,

11:51.166 --> 11:53.750
-not just the nipple. So…
-Mom, stop. Just go change.

12:04.875 --> 12:05.875
Mmm.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.708
Mom, what is wrong with you?

12:18.166 --> 12:19.708
I think I'm a little anemic.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.625
I need some iron.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.708
What is it that I wanted to ask you?

12:33.291 --> 12:35.333
-I don't know, Mom. I'm not a mind-reader.
-Hmm.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.083
When is Dad coming to see you skate?

12:37.666 --> 12:38.625
He's not.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.666
-I'm so sorry, honey.
-I'm used to it.

12:44.625 --> 12:45.583
Don't say that.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.041
It's true.
It's always something about his work.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.333
Hmm. You know,
it's also his work that…

12:53.666 --> 12:58.083
pays for this trip,
your ice-skating lessons, and our house.

12:59.125 --> 13:03.125
So, because Dad pays for everything
it means he gets to miss everything?

13:03.208 --> 13:06.833
All I'm saying is,
he sacrifices a lot for us too.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.833
You're defending him? I know
he did something that led to your divorce.

13:10.416 --> 13:11.958
I'm not stupid, Mom.

13:12.041 --> 13:12.916
It's complicated.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.208
Actually, it's not.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.333
You deserve better.

13:21.916 --> 13:23.583
This isn't the time or the place.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.250
It's never the time or the place
for you to open up.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.041
Oh, come on, Bec. That's unfair.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.083
Isn't it?

13:33.333 --> 13:36.666
Because I don't know why
you and Dad got divorced.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.791
Or anything about your childhood,
your parents, your dreams.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.833
Anything about you.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.083
I told you. When--

13:45.166 --> 13:48.041
Yeah. When I'm older,
you'll tell me everything and…

13:49.708 --> 13:51.375
What is the big secret?

13:54.458 --> 13:57.000
You act like you're some kind
of secret spy or something.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.625
You know what? I don't even care anymore.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.541
This? Us? It's gonna be
whatever it's gonna be.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.083
I'm not trying to be difficult--

14:23.166 --> 14:24.333
Yeah, you just are.

14:30.541 --> 14:33.958
Okay. Fine. I get it. You want some space.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.875
So, how about I miss the morning practice

14:36.958 --> 14:38.916
-and we meet up afterwards?
-You can't.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.833
All the chaperones have to be there.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.166
But, yeah, after that maybe you can…

14:46.791 --> 14:49.708
I don't know. Occupy yourself with…

14:51.208 --> 14:52.291
whatever.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.000
Bec, I…

15:28.333 --> 15:29.833
Faina can't come.

15:29.916 --> 15:33.291
Her dad grounded her
for going out the other night.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.541
-For how long?
-Who knows?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.208
Her dad's a dick.

15:40.541 --> 15:44.500
But all the same,
in Faina's honor, let's get shit-faced.

16:00.666 --> 16:01.583
Come on.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.208
You still got me.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.333
Yeah, but without Faina,

16:08.291 --> 16:09.833
we can't have a threesome.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.958
-"Threesome"?
-Mmm.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.625
I was going to have a girl-to-girl talk
with Faina about the three of us

16:16.708 --> 16:18.833
getting into some trouble.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.958
I mean, unless you're not
interested in that?

16:22.041 --> 16:23.375
No, no, no. Of course.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.958
If there's a party happening,
I'm always down.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.708
You know that.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.916
Well, I was really hoping it was tonight.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.125
It can still be.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.041
Just…

16:34.750 --> 16:35.958
-minus one.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.375
Been there, done that.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.583
Let's do something

16:43.291 --> 16:44.416
we'll never forget.

16:44.958 --> 16:48.250
Right. Absolutely.
Love the way you're thinking.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.708
Maybe I should talk to Faina
so next time we meet,

16:52.333 --> 16:54.208
we can just get to it.

16:54.791 --> 16:56.958
Yeah, yeah. For sure.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.625
She got a number I can hit her up on?

16:58.708 --> 17:00.125
Uh-huh. Um…

17:00.208 --> 17:03.458
But the thing is,
the phone is probably tapped.

17:04.166 --> 17:07.083
So, you got to be careful what you say.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.041
Got it.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.291
Let's drink?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.166
Yes. Can you bring some?

18:22.625 --> 18:23.458
Hello?

18:26.041 --> 18:27.791
Heard someone is on lockdown.

18:27.875 --> 18:32.250
Yeah. Some cute girl got me in trouble.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.333
Not yet, she didn't.

18:34.916 --> 18:37.916
Promises, promises.

18:38.625 --> 18:41.750
Tell me, Faina,
do you believe in miracles?

18:41.833 --> 18:44.625
No, I like you.

18:44.708 --> 18:49.541
Please don't be one of those
cheesy girls who believes in unicorns.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.583
Look out your window, silly.

18:58.541 --> 19:01.416
Now I can even start believing
in Santa Claus.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.416
So, what are you doing up there?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.416
Having a second date with you.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.250
Hmm.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.375
By the way,
you should be careful what you say.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.000
The phone is probably bugged.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.416
Don't worry. I took care of that.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.500
Well, aren't you full of surprises.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.125
So, what do you want to talk about?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.000
Anything.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.000
I just want to get to know you.

19:45.958 --> 19:51.583
When Chernobyl had the meltdown,
my mother was

19:51.666 --> 19:55.083
doing research in a town
50 kilometers south.

19:56.541 --> 19:59.333
Most of her team was dead
within three years.

20:01.541 --> 20:02.875
<i>Faina, I'm so sorry.</i>

20:04.125 --> 20:06.625
Yeah. Me, too.

20:08.208 --> 20:13.458
And last night I lost this pendant
she gave me. But I'm not sure where.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.375
Maybe at the station.

20:24.041 --> 20:25.583
She gave you this to remember her by?

20:25.666 --> 20:26.541
Yes.

20:27.458 --> 20:32.833
She gave my father her jewelry box.
And when you open it,

20:32.916 --> 20:38.458
a precious little ballerina inside turns
while it plays this piece by Tchaikovsky.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.583
<i>That's nice.</i>

20:43.750 --> 20:45.916
<i>I wish I had something,</i>

20:46.916 --> 20:50.833
<i>anything, to remind me of my mother.</i>

20:52.333 --> 20:53.750
Why? What happened to her?

20:57.916 --> 21:01.458
She died in a fire when I was five.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.041
<i>It's okay.</i>

21:10.125 --> 21:10.958
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:12.958 --> 21:14.125
It is.

21:17.250 --> 21:22.416
Because I think we were meant
to find each other, Anya.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.458
Yannick's phone didn't give us anything?

21:34.541 --> 21:37.125
Looks like all his calls were made
to one landline number.

21:37.208 --> 21:40.333
So, that landline is probably
hooked up to some kind of router

21:40.416 --> 21:41.708
which encrypted his real calls.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.375
Great. So, what now?

21:43.458 --> 21:47.375
If we wanna know who he was talking to,
plotting with, we need to get that router.

21:47.458 --> 21:48.458
Can you trace that?

21:48.541 --> 21:51.333
Of course. What do you think?
That's the first thing I did.

21:51.416 --> 21:55.916
Look, it's in this area called…
Pan Bendito.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.250
That's not exactly
the friendliest part of Madrid.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.583
Okay, girls. Come on.

22:01.666 --> 22:05.416
Let's see some jumps. High on them blades.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.333
Hello?

22:06.416 --> 22:07.291
Where you at?

22:07.375 --> 22:08.750
<i>Ice-skating practice.</i>

22:08.833 --> 22:09.666
Leave.

22:09.750 --> 22:10.833
I can't.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.750
<i>I thought we had this discussion.</i>

22:15.000 --> 22:17.708
I don't have many commitments here,
but this is one of them.

22:17.791 --> 22:21.208
So, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.750
-I'll hit you back when I'm done.

22:23.833 --> 22:24.791
Very nice.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.458
Lovely jump, Becca.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.500
Okay. Good, girls. Now, I need to…

22:31.583 --> 22:33.958
Kimberly, Kelly, over here, please.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.541
Look at you. I love your hair.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.958
Oh, thanks.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.583
Just needed a change.

22:43.666 --> 22:45.833
So, girl, how's the trip so far?

22:47.458 --> 22:48.625
It's, uh…

22:50.916 --> 22:52.000
you know, good.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.083
Come on, now, don't shine me, Jenny.

22:57.625 --> 23:01.375
Just, um…
Becca and I are not getting along, so…

23:02.291 --> 23:03.416
It's tough.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.041
Whatever I do or say is wrong.

23:07.625 --> 23:08.666
Get in line.

23:12.166 --> 23:16.000
It wasn't so long ago,
I was Becca's everything.

23:18.666 --> 23:22.166
-I wish I could go back to that.
-No. See, that's where you lose me.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.541
When they're little, you got to be
more patient and understanding.

23:25.625 --> 23:28.291
But now, whenever Maddie
acts like she knows better,

23:28.375 --> 23:31.666
I remind her I brought her
into this world and I can take her out.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.708
They just think we're so pathetic.

23:43.291 --> 23:47.458
They have no idea
we were once young and not so…

23:48.458 --> 23:50.041
I don't know, mom-like?

23:57.750 --> 24:00.000
I'm just worried I've messed Becca up.

24:00.666 --> 24:04.916
And she's gonna spend the rest of her life
in some therapy chair.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.416
Girl, that train
has already left the station.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.791
No matter what we do,
we fuck them up somehow.

24:14.375 --> 24:15.625
You're probably right.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.000
You know I am.

24:19.208 --> 24:23.208
They just need to grow up and figure
their own shit out. That's all I'm saying.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.291
Hmm.

24:34.583 --> 24:35.750
What?

24:35.833 --> 24:39.958
You think I can sit through these
cold-ass, boring-ass practices sober?

24:40.041 --> 24:41.083
You crazy.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.083
By the way, your secret is safe with me.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.916
Becca told Maddie you keep disappearing
and not coming home.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.458
-It's not what it looks like.
-Yes, it is.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.458
You out there trying to catch some dick.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.375
Uh…

25:02.458 --> 25:03.916
It's not exactly--

25:04.000 --> 25:05.208
Don't sweat it.

25:05.833 --> 25:09.125
You keep doing you
and I'll keep an eye on Becca.

25:12.083 --> 25:12.958
Thank you.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.416
Too loud!
I don't wanna hear that toe kick.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.541
Spin the leg.

25:24.625 --> 25:25.666
Lose the bling.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.958
Ain't gonna happen.
Told you, it's my lucky watch.

25:28.041 --> 25:30.875
My mama gave it to me.
Always keeps me safe.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.166
Where you from again?

25:32.958 --> 25:33.916
The Big Peach.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.083
Atlanta. There are
bad neighborhoods there, right?

25:37.666 --> 25:39.208
My hood, Grove Park…

25:41.375 --> 25:42.416
ain't no joke.

25:43.125 --> 25:47.125
Okay. Well, imagine Grove Park
and all the steroids.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.208
That's what we're about to walk into.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.416
And your point is?

25:50.958 --> 25:52.458
They're gonna take your watch.

25:52.541 --> 25:55.708
White boy from Peoria,
you're gonna school me on the hood?

25:55.791 --> 25:57.083
It's not about that.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.333
We're, uh, trying to keep a low profile

26:00.416 --> 26:03.666
and you're walking in there with
a year's worth of salary on your wrist.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.791
Okay. Look, I'll cover it up.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.666
But I ain't taking it off, man.

26:07.750 --> 26:08.750
All right.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.458
Let me ask you something.
Why am I here, again?

26:11.541 --> 26:13.916
'Cause I'm IT support. Or did you forget?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.250
I need back up and Anya's unavailable.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.833
-Wasn't part of the deal, motherfucker.
-It is now.

26:19.833 --> 26:22.375
Look, just follow my lead.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.416
Hi. What's your name?

26:32.000 --> 26:32.875
Vasco.

26:32.958 --> 26:36.208
-Vasco. You speak English, Vasco?
-A little bit.

26:36.291 --> 26:39.208
We're looking
to speak to Yannick. Is he in?

26:41.750 --> 26:42.833
Come.

26:42.916 --> 26:44.166
Thank you.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.125
Wait. I'll find Yannick.

27:38.833 --> 27:41.208
These kids are running
a full-on troll farm.

27:44.916 --> 27:47.583
Yannick
had his fingers in a lot of pies.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.250
No, no. What's whack is
these kids are sitting here in Spain

27:51.333 --> 27:54.875
spreading misinformation,
disinformation, throughout the world, man.

27:57.541 --> 27:59.916
They could do more damage
than a nuclear weapon.

28:03.791 --> 28:05.458
You packing, by any chance?

28:05.541 --> 28:07.708
-Excuse me?
-Do you have a gun?

28:07.791 --> 28:10.208
No. Why?

28:13.000 --> 28:16.125
Well, he just went to go get Yannick, but…

28:17.458 --> 28:19.958
-Yannick is dead.
-Maybe they don't know that.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.833
But we know he is.
So, who is little Vasco getting?

28:22.916 --> 28:24.166
I don't know, man. His mama.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.291
Gentlemen!

28:32.375 --> 28:36.041
I hear you're looking for Yannick.

28:36.125 --> 28:39.000
<i>Sí.</i> We're, uh, old friends.

28:39.541 --> 28:41.000
Looking to do some business.

28:41.541 --> 28:44.333
Yannick will be here any second.

28:47.916 --> 28:52.958
So, can I bring you
some <i>cervezas</i> while you wait?

28:53.041 --> 28:54.125
Sure.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.291
Everyone remain calm.

29:01.958 --> 29:03.291
Oh, shit.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.375
Oh, my God.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.291
-Oh, my God.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.375
You got a problem.

29:17.458 --> 29:19.333
-Yannick is dead.

29:21.125 --> 29:22.250
That's a lie.

29:22.333 --> 29:23.583
It's not a lie.

29:24.791 --> 29:25.708
He's dead.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.958
That's why you haven't heard from him.

29:31.791 --> 29:32.625
Yeah, uh…

29:33.458 --> 29:34.875
so you're all free now.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.666
Why don't y'all go hack NASA
or the Philippines?

29:37.750 --> 29:42.000
Whatever the fuck y'all wanna do,
just… let us go, please?

29:42.083 --> 29:44.541
Right after you give us
that device you've been using

29:44.625 --> 29:46.250
to encrypt Yannick's calls from prison.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.958
-Why do you need that?
-That's my business.

29:51.041 --> 29:55.833
But, in return,
you can keep operating here freely.

29:57.125 --> 30:00.958
I give you my word that
the local authorities won't bother you.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.708
Please don't let me get killed
by a bunch of kids.

30:05.791 --> 30:07.208
I don't wanna die like this.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.500
With this White man.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.375
Deal.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.750
Oh, my God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.166
But we want the watch.

30:19.875 --> 30:22.375
The router for the watch.

30:22.916 --> 30:24.791
It's a fair trade.

30:24.875 --> 30:25.708
<i>Que no?</i>

30:25.791 --> 30:29.791
No, no. No <i>"Que no."</i>
My mama gave me this watch.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.541
Ask her for another then.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.250
My mama gonna kill me.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.916
At least you have a mom.

30:39.541 --> 30:41.083
Oh, you're gonna take it there. Okay.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.833
All right. Take the damn watch, man.

30:43.666 --> 30:47.166
It looks so much better on me. Look.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.375
Ooh.

30:48.458 --> 30:49.458
-No, it don't.
-It does.

30:49.541 --> 30:50.916
-Look.
-It don't. It does not.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.625
You know what? Keep the damn watch.

30:54.833 --> 30:55.875
Shut up.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.125
-And then I'll make some lunch.

31:20.916 --> 31:22.916
You looked good on the ice today.

31:23.000 --> 31:23.833
Yeah.

31:34.333 --> 31:35.333
Can we talk?

31:37.541 --> 31:39.166
Becca, I just asked you something.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.625
What? I didn't hear you.

31:42.708 --> 31:43.958
What are you doing?

31:44.041 --> 31:45.250
I'm trying to communicate.

31:45.333 --> 31:46.583
You didn't wanna talk before.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.125
Well, I wanna talk now.

31:48.666 --> 31:52.125
The girls are getting together in a few.
I need to shower and get ready.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.000
I understand you more than you know.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.375
Yeah, if you say so.

31:58.083 --> 31:58.916
Hey.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.458
I love you. You know that, right?

32:02.541 --> 32:05.125
Yeah, but sometimes you say it
and I'm not sure you mean it.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.458
What?

32:09.791 --> 32:11.333
I don't know exactly.

32:12.916 --> 32:14.125
It's like we talked about.

32:14.208 --> 32:17.041
Maybe a little space on this trip
is the best for both of us.

32:36.208 --> 32:39.250
Yannick's router had
much more than just phone numbers on it.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.875
You see all these numbers?

32:40.958 --> 32:45.041
They're coded values that correspond
to a series of longitudes and latitudes.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.291
Coordinates which could suggest
specific locations

32:47.375 --> 32:49.375
that could be targeted
for a terrorist attack.

32:49.458 --> 32:52.125
Or a series of attacks
in and around the city of Madrid.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.583
And it looks as if
each of our so-called victims,

32:55.666 --> 33:00.708
the businessman, the student
and the plaza lady,

33:00.791 --> 33:03.458
can all be traced back
to an individual target site.

33:03.541 --> 33:06.083
Our businessman,
Mario Santa-Cruz,

33:06.166 --> 33:08.416
was a CEO
of a very successful trading company

33:08.500 --> 33:10.375
with an office in the Centro Colón.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.416
Our student, Kristian Arija Ax,

33:12.500 --> 33:15.958
was an opera buff who worked
at the box office of the Teatro Real.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.666
And our plaza lady, Bárbara Pérez Soler,

33:18.750 --> 33:21.625
was head of marketing
at the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.291
Mm-hmm. And I'd say,
what Yannick got from these folks

33:24.375 --> 33:26.291
was some good inside intel
on site security.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.458
I don't get why Yannick Mair,

33:28.541 --> 33:32.250
a local figure in organized crime,
is now becoming a terrorist.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.291
Or why the CIA cares
about any of this in the first place.

33:35.375 --> 33:38.583
The US is invested
in the stability of European democracies.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.458
So what you're saying is,

33:41.541 --> 33:45.416
the reason is on a need-to-know basis
and I do not need to know.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.333
Yes.

33:46.416 --> 33:48.291
I deciphered something else
from this data.

33:48.375 --> 33:50.541
One more victim
who hasn't yet been accounted for.

33:50.625 --> 33:53.416
Her name is Lidia Orsorio.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.666
She works as a docent
at the Temple of Debod.

33:55.750 --> 33:59.916
It's this ancient temple that was
a gift from the Egyptian government.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.750
It was moved stone by stone

34:01.833 --> 34:04.666
and rebuilt in the Parque del Oeste
near the Madrid royal palace.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.916
So it has strategic value
due to its proximity to the royal palace.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.916
For sure. Yeah.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.458
And what about this Lidia woman?

34:10.541 --> 34:13.458
Not only is she alive and well,

34:13.541 --> 34:15.625
she is set to tie the knot
tomorrow afternoon

34:15.708 --> 34:18.250
at the church
of Santa Engracia in Zaragoza.

34:20.583 --> 34:24.083
So, the question is,
why hasn't something happened to Lidia?

34:43.458 --> 34:44.666
So far, so good.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.416
Calm before the storm.

34:47.958 --> 34:49.875
I'm more a "glass half-filled" kinda guy.

34:51.708 --> 34:57.208
I'm Russian. There's no glass
to begin with, so nothing to fill.

34:59.416 --> 35:03.125
So, was your wedding
anything like this, Jenny?

35:05.166 --> 35:06.541
I know what you're doing.

35:08.666 --> 35:11.083
Yeah. Getting to know you.

35:11.750 --> 35:15.375
Anything I tell you will be used
against me at some point or another.

35:16.250 --> 35:18.916
Or, we're just getting
to know one another.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.208
Oh.

35:21.541 --> 35:22.750
You first then.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.208
-Ever been married?
-No.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.166
Engaged?

35:28.833 --> 35:29.666
Yes.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.083
What happened?

35:34.416 --> 35:35.291
Life.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.916
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.125
Says the divorcée.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.666
Maybe I got tired of running.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.250
But it wasn't always like that?

35:45.333 --> 35:46.416
Of course not.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.791
He sweep you off your feet?

35:52.250 --> 35:53.666
I got pregnant with Becca.

35:54.458 --> 35:55.416
Shotgun wedding?

35:55.500 --> 35:59.791
Drag queen, "Tequila Mockingbird,"
officiating at Burning Man.

35:59.875 --> 36:02.041
Romantic.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.541
Practical. I needed health insurance.

36:13.000 --> 36:13.875
You love him?

36:15.708 --> 36:17.208
He's the father of my child.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.291
That doesn't answer the question.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.541
Chauncey…

36:31.625 --> 36:32.500
Yeah, I see.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.500
-I got him. You get to her.
-Copy that.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.500
Hey, buddy.

36:47.166 --> 36:48.666
Look at me.

36:48.750 --> 36:49.958
Eyes right here.

36:51.041 --> 36:53.541
I'm here to help you. Put the gun down.

36:53.625 --> 36:56.291
Lidia!

36:58.916 --> 37:00.166
Put the gun down.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.791
-Lidia! Lidia!

37:08.958 --> 37:09.791
Shit.

37:26.583 --> 37:27.625
Oh, God.

37:48.083 --> 37:52.166
Have you seen how many sequins Claire
has managed to cram onto her costume?

37:52.250 --> 37:56.166
Okay, she has the most bedazzled bodice
in the history of big-titted bitches.

37:56.250 --> 37:58.708
Come on, your costume
is so much better than hers.

37:58.791 --> 38:00.833
Yeah, but I'm missing that flair.

38:00.916 --> 38:04.291
You know how the judges are.
They're all about bling and glitter.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.041
Well, we'll work it out.

38:06.125 --> 38:07.041
We better.

38:08.125 --> 38:09.958
Okay. I'll catch you later.

38:10.041 --> 38:10.875
See ya.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.708
Goddamn, Chauncey!
You exposed yourself back there!

40:12.791 --> 40:13.958
I had no choice.

40:14.041 --> 40:14.958
It don't even matter.

40:15.041 --> 40:17.958
Zaragoza police…
They're gonna be all over this shit now.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.833
Bullets I used won't trace back to us.

40:19.916 --> 40:20.750
Bullshit…

40:23.625 --> 40:25.958
Some of those girls
weren't much older than Becca.

40:27.000 --> 40:27.833
I know.

40:27.916 --> 40:30.125
So, Lidia… She just merked her
entire bridal party?

40:30.208 --> 40:35.958
No. I looked into her eyes.
That was not Lidia or Miguel.

40:36.708 --> 40:38.125
They were both innocent victims

40:38.208 --> 40:41.041
of some sort of mind control
I've never seen before.

40:41.125 --> 40:43.250
Yeah. I agree.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.500
Whoever has that skillset
wants to cover their tracks

40:45.583 --> 40:47.958
by making it look like something
The Whisper might do.

40:49.875 --> 40:51.625
Is your past coming back to haunt you?

40:53.000 --> 40:57.500
Everyone from back then
is either dead or in Siberia.

40:57.583 --> 40:58.958
Which is worse than death.

41:02.041 --> 41:04.000
I'm gonna look at
more of Lidia's bio here.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.000
See if I can find
who she might go to for help

41:06.083 --> 41:08.500
or maybe where she might go
to lay low for a while.

41:08.583 --> 41:09.916
Give me that.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.583
I know a little something
about how to disappear.

41:17.750 --> 41:18.625
I'll find her.

41:36.541 --> 41:38.000
You owe me.

41:38.666 --> 41:40.791
You'll get yours. Don't worry about it.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.125
And?

41:58.208 --> 41:59.916
From our girlfriend.

42:03.833 --> 42:05.541
-What's this?

42:23.541 --> 42:24.750
Mom.

42:57.416 --> 43:02.208
MARSHAL TUKHACHEVSKY STREET.

43:29.041 --> 43:31.208
Good work, little bird.

43:31.291 --> 43:34.875
With the tracking device in the pendant,
we can map out the embassy.

43:42.333 --> 43:43.291
Thank you.

43:44.375 --> 43:45.666
Seems you were right.

43:45.750 --> 43:48.375
The girl was a better mark
than the ambassador's son.

46:07.666 --> 46:09.666
Okay, Lidia. Let's go.

46:19.208 --> 46:21.541
You have Miguel's family here.

46:23.666 --> 46:25.250
But you don't have yours.

46:26.875 --> 46:30.416
No parents, no siblings.

46:31.958 --> 46:32.916
Why?

46:38.875 --> 46:41.583
"May 9th, 1999."

46:42.791 --> 46:46.708
"Small plane catches fire,
Carmen and Mateo Orsorio killed."

46:47.791 --> 46:50.791
"But their daughter, Lidia, survives."

46:55.833 --> 46:57.583
So you were left an orphan.

47:00.708 --> 47:04.791
All alone.
Until you met Miguel. Fell in love.

47:05.333 --> 47:08.291
And now you've lost Miguel.
You have no home.

47:09.208 --> 47:11.041
Nowhere you will feel safe.

47:11.625 --> 47:13.875
No way to be with the people you love.

47:13.958 --> 47:15.333
Unless…

47:18.625 --> 47:21.125
Cementerio de La Almudena.

47:41.750 --> 47:44.416
-Lidia. Do not be afraid. I'm--
-No!

47:45.458 --> 47:47.291
I did horrible things.

47:47.375 --> 47:49.541
I killed my friends. You stay away!

47:49.625 --> 47:53.000
Lidia. Please. Let me help you.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.083
Lidia…
