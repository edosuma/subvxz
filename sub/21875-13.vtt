NARRATOR:
<i> Last week on</i>
Walker, Texas Ranger:

00:03.400 --> 00:04.800
TRIVETTE:
What are you doing?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.230
Why are you driving so fast?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.570
The accelerator's stuck.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.370
Well, get your foot off it!
I am. I'm pump--

00:12.440 --> 00:14.540
You know, this is the first time
I've ever heard of

00:14.540 --> 00:16.540
an individual trying
to take out two Rangers.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.880
Whoever this
drug kingpin is,

00:18.880 --> 00:20.280
he's taking it personal.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.280
WALKER:
<i> What's his name?</i>

00:22.280 --> 00:24.420
TRIVETTE:
<i> Curt Nypo.</i>

00:24.420 --> 00:26.450
Run a make on him.
You got it.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.960
Walker, Trivette,
I'd like you to meet

00:27.960 --> 00:29.490
Professor Peter Needham.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.030
How do you do?
Nice meeting you, fellas.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.160
Alex can date
anyone she wants to.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.500
It doesn't matter to me.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.100
According to these,
two girls were raped

00:36.100 --> 00:38.160
in that same
parking garage,

00:38.170 --> 00:40.700
and it was the same exact
set of circumstances too.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.370
TRIVETTE:
<i> Girl's alone. She's coming</i>
<i> from class. Empty stairwell.</i>

00:43.370 --> 00:44.470
( screams )

00:44.470 --> 00:45.740
My friend was raped
last summer.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.110
Ever since,
I've been spooked.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.480
<i> They say he was one</i>
<i> of the professors.</i>

00:49.480 --> 00:50.540
You all right?

00:50.550 --> 00:51.750
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.250
Okay.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.520
Now, dating professors,
I'm sure it's happened.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.390
But, uh, come on,
it's highly unlikely.

00:58.390 --> 01:00.350
We'd like to try
your faculty personnel file.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.820
We think he probably started
in the spring semester.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.860
TRIVETTE:
<i> You don't like women much,</i>
<i> do you, Stan?</i>

01:06.860 --> 01:08.630
I love 'em...

01:08.630 --> 01:10.230
when they know
their place.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.970
Hi, Laura.
Where's Tony?

01:11.970 --> 01:13.470
The kid you were gonna
make room for?

01:13.470 --> 01:14.570
Oh, he didn't show up.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.970
It's a stupid idea,
this karate crap.

01:16.970 --> 01:19.370
TONY:
<i> You know, my mom's boyfriend</i>
<i> was some kind of champ,</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:20.540
<i> and he's</i>
<i> a certified jerk.</i>

01:20.540 --> 01:21.910
So you wanna
learn karate, huh?

01:21.910 --> 01:23.610
I'll teach you
karate.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.110
See how good
it works?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.180
You Tony's father?

01:27.180 --> 01:30.680
No, me and Tony's mom
are engaged.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.450
NYPO:
<i> The kid here don't make it</i>
<i> any easier, either.</i>

01:33.460 --> 01:35.360
<i> I give him a job delivering</i>
<i> for my business,</i>

01:35.360 --> 01:36.660
<i> he never shows up</i>
<i> on time.</i>

01:36.660 --> 01:38.930
You're dealing
with Cordell Walker.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.930
Don't underestimate him.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.500
He's the best
they've got.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.430
The Rangers
will be dead

01:44.430 --> 01:45.770
within 24 hours.

01:52.710 --> 01:53.870
( car engine starting )

01:53.880 --> 01:55.210
( car engine starting )

01:56.080 --> 01:57.080

01:58.650 --> 01:59.810

Hoo!

03:27.300 --> 03:28.600

03:40.980 --> 03:42.650
DIVER:
Nobody's down there,
Ranger.

03:42.650 --> 03:43.750
Bottom's clear.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.320
( sniffs )

03:45.320 --> 03:46.920
Well, where the hell
could he be?

03:46.920 --> 03:47.920
We could dredge the lake,

03:47.920 --> 03:49.590
but that'll have to wait.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.530
Keep divin'.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.730
Sir!
What?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.330
We found this
on the dock.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.200
Thanks.

04:05.540 --> 04:06.840

( woman talking indistinctly
over police radio )

04:37.140 --> 04:38.510
( grunts )

04:38.510 --> 04:39.570
Wake him up.

04:40.910 --> 04:41.910
Hey, Ranger,

04:41.910 --> 04:43.440
join the living,

04:43.450 --> 04:45.550
at least
for a little bit.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.280
( grunting )

04:54.720 --> 04:57.090
DEALER:
Point five.
Shooter needs a five.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.790
Come on, baby.
Come on!

04:58.790 --> 04:59.830
Come on,
let's do it!

04:59.830 --> 05:01.700
Come on!
Come on, baby!

05:01.700 --> 05:03.930
Seven out.
No five.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.870
You guys got
an invitation?

05:15.180 --> 05:16.710
Yeah,
written by hand.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.480
All right, baby.
Bring me some luck here.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.510
Bring me some luck.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.420
( crowd groaning )

05:24.420 --> 05:25.920
Craps, Benny.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.120
You lose.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.090
Easy, boys. This ain't
nobody's business.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.860
Everybody just
stay where you are.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.230
How you play
this here game?

05:34.230 --> 05:36.360
Just pick up a pair
and put them in the air, sir.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.500
That sounds easy enough.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.830
Come, babe.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.770
Where's my partner?
I don't know.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.340
You set us up,
you piece of garbage.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.740
I didn't know they were
gonna grab your partner.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.610
I swear. I swear on
my sainted mother's grave.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.770
You tell me who,

05:48.780 --> 05:51.010
or people are gonna be swearing
on your grave.

05:51.980 --> 05:53.010
Where's my partner?

05:53.010 --> 05:54.010
( shouts ):
Where is he?

05:54.020 --> 05:57.480
8700 South Blondstat Road,

05:57.490 --> 06:00.350
in the back, okay?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.620
I mean, I--

06:01.620 --> 06:03.220
I think that's
where they took him.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.390
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

06:18.670 --> 06:20.440
This isn't
getting us anywhere.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.610
All right.

06:22.610 --> 06:25.150
Get him out of here.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.480
Dump the body out
in the brush,
someplace the coyotes

06:27.480 --> 06:29.150
will have no trouble
finding.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.990
Be careful with him.
He's dangerous as a rattler.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.750
Yeah, he looks
real dangerous.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.890
Hey!

06:34.890 --> 06:36.720
Don't jerk around.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.560
Just do what I say.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.050
Nypo says I should be
afraid of you.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.350
Well, look
how afraid I am.

07:05.290 --> 07:06.720
You should be.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.890
( grunts )

07:19.640 --> 07:21.170
TRIVETTE:
Win anything?

07:21.170 --> 07:24.700
Dice were loaded as a sailor
on a Saturday night.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.380
I'll take the back.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.380
All right.

07:37.350 --> 07:38.420
( screams )

07:41.190 --> 07:42.890
( glass breaking )

07:44.590 --> 07:45.890
It's gonna blow!

08:01.480 --> 08:04.210
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

08:27.040 --> 08:29.640
Cordell,
are you all right?

08:35.110 --> 08:36.110
( exhales )

08:37.409 --> 08:40.809
This Nypo's a real piece
of work, boy.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.020
Ex-con,

08:43.020 --> 08:44.950
long history of drug busts,

08:44.950 --> 08:48.590
assaults with intent to do
bodily harm.

08:48.590 --> 08:51.020
He beat a woman to death
back in '84.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.660
Spent eight years in stir.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.130
Third-degree black belt,

08:56.130 --> 08:58.500
kickboxing champion
at Folsom.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Yeah, you're right,

08:59.500 --> 09:01.430
he's a real
piece of work.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.240
But if you know Nypo's
the guy at the drug lab,

09:03.240 --> 09:05.040
let's go on over there
and get him.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.370
All I heard
was a voice,

09:06.370 --> 09:08.140
and I can't arrest him
on that.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.710
I know that.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.280
C.D., let me
borrow your car.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.150
What?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.780
Let me
borrow your car.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.190
Well, now, you be careful
with old Goldie.

09:25.430 --> 09:26.890
Where you goin'?

09:26.890 --> 09:28.990
I'm gonna see
Tony's mother.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.600
C.D.:
Be careful
with that car!

09:30.600 --> 09:33.230
I don't loan that car
to just anybody.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.640
( birds chirping )

10:10.470 --> 10:15.110
(<i> slow, sad theme playing</i> )

11:01.490 --> 11:05.060
I told you not to
underestimate Walker.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.160
I didn't.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.160
I overestimated
those mouth breathers

11:08.160 --> 11:10.330
you got working for you.

11:10.330 --> 11:13.070
Next time, I'll handle Walker
by myself.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.070
Messing with Rangers
was a stupid idea.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.600
You're out of your league
with this guy.

11:19.940 --> 11:20.940
( glass breaking )

11:22.340 --> 11:24.440
Maybe you're the one's
out of his league, huh?

11:24.450 --> 11:26.080
Hey, Curt. Back off.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.980
Or what,
you gonna hurt me?

11:27.980 --> 11:29.880
I sprang you
from prison, pal.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.820
You owe me.
We have a deal.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.320
Guess what?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.790
It's time
to renegotiate.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.630
(<i> pensive theme playing</i> )

12:11.990 --> 12:13.590
I need to speak to Curt.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.230
Yeah, in a minute.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.600
Hey, Curt.
Your kid is here.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.310
I ain't his kid.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.710
Tell him
to get in here.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.450
Where the hell
you been?

12:36.450 --> 12:38.050
Since when do you care?

12:38.050 --> 12:40.650
Since you disappeared
with half a kilo.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.300
You didn't deliver it
like you were supposed to.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.530
Ed called me last night.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.800
You think I wasn't
gonna find out?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.500
What, you going into business
for yourself?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.970
No!

12:55.970 --> 12:57.440
I'll bet you are.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.440
How much you get for it?

13:01.580 --> 13:02.940
I threw it away,
Curt.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.510
You threw it away.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.310
You threw it away?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.980
I'm not gonna do this
anymore.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.820
I'm not gonna deliver drugs
for you anymore.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.390
I don't care
what you do to me.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.650
You'll do
whatever I say, Tony.

wanna know

if you don't.

( choking ):
I don't care what
you do to me.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.700
You better start.

13:26.570 --> 13:29.370
If you don't shape up
right here and now,

13:29.370 --> 13:31.100
the next time
you see your mother,

13:31.110 --> 13:33.170
she's gonna have
a broken arm.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.370
And it'll be your fault.

That was cute.

Ranger Walker's really doing
good things with you, isn't he?

13:52.290 --> 13:55.300
You want kickboxing lessons,
you went to the wrong place.

I was Folsom Prison kickboxing
champ three years runnin'.

14:01.670 --> 14:04.400
TONY ( whispers ):
All right, I-I won't create
any more problems.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.140
Just don't
hurt my mom, okay?

14:06.140 --> 14:08.270
Sure, kid.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.180
And you stay away
from that Ranger.

14:35.540 --> 14:36.540
Yes?

14:36.540 --> 14:38.000
I'm Ranger Cordell Walker.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.210
Oh.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.680
Why? Is Tony
in some kind of trouble?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.310
May I come in?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.910
Um, well...

14:47.920 --> 14:48.910
okay.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.050
But just for
a few minutes.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.720
I'm due at work
in half an hour.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.320
You know,
I really-- I want to thank you

14:57.330 --> 14:59.220
for everything
you're doing for Tony.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.390
He's really--
He's changed a lot

15:01.400 --> 15:02.830
since you took him
in your program.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.600
Well, Tony's a good boy.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.400
How does he get along
with your fiancé?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.070
Do you know Curt?

15:09.070 --> 15:10.370
Yeah, we met.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.640
Where?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.310
At school.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.170
Tony seemed
a little intimidated by him.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.680
Oh, uh...

15:17.680 --> 15:21.280
Curt can sometimes be
a little forceful,

15:21.280 --> 15:22.880
but I think
it's good for Tony

15:22.880 --> 15:25.290
to have a father figure
around the house, don't you?

15:25.290 --> 15:27.420
That depends.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.420
How did that happen?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.790
Excuse me?

15:30.790 --> 15:31.790
The bruise.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.690
( laughs )

15:34.700 --> 15:36.100
A shoe box fell on me.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.560
It's the
darnedest thing.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.400
Excuse me, ma'am, but it looks
like someone hit you.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.170
Does your fiancé
get forceful with you too?

15:45.610 --> 15:48.470
You know, I really have to
get to work now, Mr. Walker.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.640
You could get help, you know.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.180
I don't need...

15:52.180 --> 15:53.210
any help.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.950
Well, maybe Tony does.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.750
Look...

16:00.760 --> 16:03.020
( sighs )

16:03.020 --> 16:05.460
Here's my card.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.630
If you ever want to talk,

16:06.630 --> 16:09.260
give me a call.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.780
You know, C.D.
could wash this car.

16:30.050 --> 16:33.020
( laughing ):
Oh, yeah, right.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.590
Look who's talkin', man.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.190
You know, you should've
never talked him

16:36.190 --> 16:37.260
into loaning it to us.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.290
Why?

16:39.160 --> 16:40.830
Because he loves
this car.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.000
If something
should happen--

16:42.000 --> 16:43.360
Nothing's gonna
happen to it.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.370
Yeah, right.
What happens if we get a call?

16:45.370 --> 16:46.700
What do we tell the bad guys?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.530
"Hey, don't shoot.
It's a borrowed car."

16:48.540 --> 16:50.100
Whatever works.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.710
Hey, there's Tony.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.540
(<i> pensive theme playing</i> )

17:00.450 --> 17:02.220
Ain't he supposed to be
in karate class?

17:02.220 --> 17:03.220
Yeah.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.210
( knock on door )

17:27.210 --> 17:28.210
FINCH:
I got it.

17:33.710 --> 17:34.780
Bring the food?

17:34.780 --> 17:35.780
Yeah.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.820
Let's have it.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.930
Now, you listen, kid,

17:46.930 --> 17:48.800
and listen carefully.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
This is a big order.
It's with some volume guys

17:50.800 --> 17:53.230
I've been wantin' to do
business with for a long time.

17:53.230 --> 17:55.400
NYPO:
I want you to put it
in their laps.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.440
They're gonna give you
50,000 bucks.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.640
I want you to count it
and get out of there.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.370
NYPO:
Finch'll be waiting
down the block.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.580
Give him the money.
Then go on about your business.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.240
You got that?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.080
Yeah.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.880
You blow this,
there's no place on earth

18:08.880 --> 18:10.050
you're gonna
be able to hide.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.120
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

18:34.410 --> 18:36.440
( starts engine )

18:37.510 --> 18:38.910
What are you doing?

18:38.910 --> 18:41.210
Let's follow him.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.620
I've got a hunch.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
( horn honks )

19:03.640 --> 19:05.940
It's illegal to ride a bicycle
that fast.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.410
( horn honks )

19:10.410 --> 19:12.810
MAN:
Hey, kid, watch the road, huh?

19:15.080 --> 19:18.250
Hey.
How are you, Vicki?

19:18.250 --> 19:19.390
Good.
Hey, I wanted to ask you

19:19.390 --> 19:21.420
about the
sociology course.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.090
VICKI:
I was thinking
about taking 20-21.

19:23.090 --> 19:24.460
PETER:
Is my tie crooked?

19:24.460 --> 19:26.130
VICKI:
Yeah, but it looks nice on you.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.890
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow,
okay, Peter?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.560
Great. Okay, bye-bye, now.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.170
Hey.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.000
Hi.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.470
Hey.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.740
I was just
thinking about you.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.910
You know, uh,
I'm working late tonight.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.210
Uh, you wanna grab a bite?

19:47.950 --> 19:49.320
Alex?

19:49.320 --> 19:51.080
You okay?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.220
Just a lot
on my mind.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.850
Big caseload, huh?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.490
Yeah,
something like that.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.120
Well, I guess we can rest
a little easier,

19:57.120 --> 20:00.130
now that your friends have
Stan Perkins behind bars.

20:00.130 --> 20:01.730
At least
we can rest easier around here.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.360
Hopefully.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.860
We're waiting
for final confirmation

20:04.870 --> 20:06.270
that he's the one
we're looking for.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.770
Oh.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.200
Well, I'm sure
you'll get it.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.070
By the way,
did you have that information

20:13.070 --> 20:14.470
that Walker asked for?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.510
Yeah.
It's in my office.

20:16.510 --> 20:19.010
I just assumed
that, uh,

20:19.010 --> 20:21.780
with Perkins being arrested
that the point was moot, but...

20:21.780 --> 20:23.450
I can send it over
to your office

20:23.450 --> 20:24.720
if you'd like.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.650
That'd be great.
I'd appreciate it.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.050
I'll see you
after class.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.220
I'll be there.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.460
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

20:42.470 --> 20:44.400
MAN:
Hey! The kid's here.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.290
Somebody named Chester
order egg rolls?

21:00.290 --> 21:02.690
That's me.

21:02.690 --> 21:03.760
You got the MSG?

21:05.630 --> 21:07.760
I'm supposed to see
the money first.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.730
CHESTER:
That's no problem.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.710
Let's eat.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.820
CHESTER:
All right.

21:50.270 --> 21:52.040
Yeah, Peru.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.780
Chitico Mountains, huh?
Late October...

21:55.780 --> 22:02.150
A high-grade Swedish ether.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.150
( laughs )

22:03.150 --> 22:04.150
Stepped once.

22:06.190 --> 22:08.090
Load your bags, kid.

22:08.090 --> 22:09.990
Texas Ranger!
Don't move!

22:12.030 --> 22:13.560
Come here, Tony.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.760
Look out!

22:14.760 --> 22:15.760
( grunts )

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
( screams )

22:27.780 --> 22:28.770
( grunts )

22:34.150 --> 22:35.180
Where's Tony?

22:35.180 --> 22:36.580
He took off.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.550
Guess there's no doubt
he's running for Nypo, huh?

22:38.550 --> 22:39.790
Yeah, looks that way.

22:39.790 --> 22:42.420
Let's call for a unit
to come pick these guys up.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.120
And let's go look for the boy.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.230
(<i> slow, pensive theme playing</i> )

22:54.770 --> 22:57.540
Now would be a good time
to pull over.

23:13.550 --> 23:14.820
Get off the bike.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.160
Are you gonna arrest me?

23:18.160 --> 23:19.890
Yes, I am.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.130
You gonna
tell my mom?

23:22.330 --> 23:24.730
You're in a lot
of trouble, Tony.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.000
I have no choice.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.750
ALEX:
There is nothing
I would like better

23:41.750 --> 23:44.120
than to issue a warrant
for Curt Nypo's arrest,

23:44.120 --> 23:46.520
but on what grounds?

23:46.520 --> 23:47.790
With Tony refusing
to talk,

23:47.790 --> 23:50.760
we have nothing to tie Nypo
to the drugs.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.490
And those guys you brought in
last night aren't talking.

23:53.490 --> 23:56.130
Tony went from Nypo's
straight to the auto shop.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.700
Maybe he picked it up
at the Chinese restaurant first.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.300
Oh, come on.
You know better than that.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.270
I know that, Walker.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.940
But without something
to tie Nypo to the drugs,

24:04.940 --> 24:07.410
I will be laughed
right out of the arraignment.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.910
I have to release Tony
into his mother's custody

24:10.910 --> 24:13.010
until the juvenile hearing.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.920
Send in Tony Kingston.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.050
Thank you.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.990
You have one more chance
to make him change his mind.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.690
( indistinct chattering,
typing )

24:31.700 --> 24:33.370
You're in a lot
of trouble, Tony.

24:33.370 --> 24:35.400
There's nothing I can do
to help you unless you decide

24:35.400 --> 24:36.470
to help yourself.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.900
Now, where did you
get the drugs?

24:41.310 --> 24:45.410
Look, all I know is that
I was delivering takeout.

24:45.410 --> 24:47.350
I didn't know that drugs
were in the boxes.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.720
Are you saying you got the drugs
from the Chinese restaurant?

24:49.720 --> 24:51.820
Tony, are you willing
to implicate

24:51.820 --> 24:54.320
innocent people
just to protect Nypo?

24:58.890 --> 25:00.230
You disappoint me, Tony.

25:00.230 --> 25:02.030
All right, let's
just say that, uh--

25:02.030 --> 25:06.000
That...Curt were to be arrested.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.670
Then, uh-- Then...

25:08.670 --> 25:09.900
what would happen to him?

25:09.900 --> 25:12.870
He would be booked,
arraigned and then tried.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.670
And then he would be--
Be in jail all that time?

25:18.610 --> 25:21.110
Well, I would
argue against it,

25:21.120 --> 25:23.580
but the judge would
probably set bail.

25:23.580 --> 25:24.620
Yep.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.350
See, I don't know a thing.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.150
( phone rings )

25:30.990 --> 25:32.490
Yes?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.660
Send her in.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.560
Tony's mother's here.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.730
Tony?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.740
I'm sorry, Ranger Walker,

25:42.740 --> 25:44.000
I-- I...

25:47.840 --> 25:48.970
God. What--?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.240
What--? What happened
to you, honey?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.310
I just got into a--

25:52.310 --> 25:53.380
I just fell on my bike--

25:53.380 --> 25:54.410
Are you okay?

25:54.410 --> 25:55.480
Yeah, I'm all right.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.580
Are you gonna tell her, Tony?

25:59.520 --> 26:00.920
What? Tell me what?

26:02.720 --> 26:05.720
Your fiancé has Tony delivering
cocaine on his bicycle.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.390
Excuse me?

26:07.390 --> 26:09.460
Nypo is dealing in cocaine,

26:09.460 --> 26:11.830
and he has your son
delivering for him.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.930
Um, you know,

26:13.930 --> 26:15.970
you must have Curt confused
with somebody else.

26:15.970 --> 26:17.370
He wouldn't do that to Tony.

26:17.370 --> 26:20.770
Are you aware that Mr. Nypo
has done time for dealing drugs?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.810
Well, he would've told me that.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.840
Did he tell you he also
beat a woman to death?

26:24.850 --> 26:25.910
What is this?

26:25.910 --> 26:27.410
The truth, Mrs. Kingston.

26:30.580 --> 26:31.950
Tony,

26:31.950 --> 26:34.250
I know you feel like
we're letting you down,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.790
but we can't prosecute Nypo

26:36.790 --> 26:38.720
unless someone testifies
against him.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.330
Can we go?

26:41.330 --> 26:42.590
Yes.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.830
You are free to go.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.300
(<i> somber theme playing</i> )

26:49.870 --> 26:50.870
( door closes )

26:55.110 --> 26:56.810
You did the best you could.

26:56.810 --> 26:59.040
Yeah...

26:59.050 --> 27:02.050
But sometimes the best
isn't good enough.

27:16.860 --> 27:20.270
I have a good mind
to sue the city.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.270
Mom--

27:21.270 --> 27:22.270
Get a good lawyer.

27:22.270 --> 27:23.270
Mom--

27:23.270 --> 27:25.200
What?

27:25.210 --> 27:27.510
Ranger Walker didn't lie,
all right?

27:27.510 --> 27:28.640
Look, honey--

27:28.640 --> 27:30.180
Mom, you know it's true.
You know it.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.610
Get your butts in here now.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.050
Both of you!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.120
Come on!

27:46.190 --> 27:47.690
What did you tell the cops?

27:47.700 --> 27:48.860
Nothing. Honest.

27:48.860 --> 27:49.960
Leave him alone,
Curt.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.130
( yelps )
Stay out of this!

27:54.770 --> 27:56.630
I thought we already
did this one.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.440
What did you tell 'em?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.040
Nothing!
Bull!

28:01.040 --> 28:03.070
If I did, you'd already
be in jail.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.950
I talked to Chester's lawyer.

28:06.950 --> 28:08.380
Chester thinks you set them up.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.480
Look, I didn't know
Ranger Walker was followin' me.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.550
All right?

28:11.550 --> 28:12.550
Curt!

28:12.550 --> 28:13.690
Stay out of this,
damn it!

28:16.560 --> 28:17.720
This wouldn't have happened

28:17.730 --> 28:19.190
if you weren't friendly
with Walker.

28:19.190 --> 28:20.790
And because you are,
I can't be sure

28:20.790 --> 28:22.060
it's not gonna happen again.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.400
Or that you're not working
for him right now.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.100
Maybe you're wearin' a wire.

28:27.670 --> 28:29.370
Or maybe you are.

28:30.370 --> 28:31.370
( shrieks )

28:32.340 --> 28:33.340
( grunts )

28:35.880 --> 28:39.180
( laughing ):
You're really gonna
regret that, pal.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.180
Run, Tony. Run!

28:41.180 --> 28:42.180
( screams )

28:44.990 --> 28:47.990
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

28:54.600 --> 28:57.200
You had no right
to treat Tony like that.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.700
He's just a kid.
No, that's it.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.960
No more.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.000
I want you
out of our lives,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
now.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.400
( grunts )

29:04.370 --> 29:05.540
Nuh--

29:09.310 --> 29:11.680
You stay away from Tony,
or I'll kill you.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.450
( chuckling)
That's funny.

29:14.450 --> 29:16.080
You know what happened
to the last woman

29:16.080 --> 29:17.480
who threatened to kill me?

29:18.050 --> 29:19.050
( grunts)

29:19.050 --> 29:20.080
( screams )

29:21.860 --> 29:23.220
( screams )

29:23.220 --> 29:25.460
Dadgum it! I should've
known better

29:25.460 --> 29:27.230
than to loan somethin'
of sentimental

29:27.230 --> 29:29.330
or extrinsic value
to you fellas.

29:29.330 --> 29:30.330
"Intrinsic," C.D.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.360
That's
what I said.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.530
Besides, it's
just a muffler.

29:32.530 --> 29:35.100
Yeah, we--
We had it replaced.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.100
No. It's much more
than a muffler.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.040
This is like an arm or a leg
laying up here.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.740
You fellas have
dismembered "Goldie."

29:42.740 --> 29:44.880
This was on
that car in 1964,

29:44.880 --> 29:47.650
when I drove it off
the showroom floor.

29:47.650 --> 29:51.980
A lender or a borrower,
I shall not be.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.520
That's what Shakespeare said.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.190
Fellas,
I love you both,

29:55.190 --> 29:57.960
but damn,
you'd tear up an anvil.

29:57.960 --> 29:58.960
If I'd loaned you fellas

29:58.960 --> 30:00.120
a bowling ball,

30:00.130 --> 30:01.530
you'd have
brought it back cracked.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.060
Damn.

30:06.330 --> 30:09.200
The information that you wanted
from the university.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.900
Peter sent it over
this afternoon.

30:13.610 --> 30:15.210
All right.
We got three professors

30:15.210 --> 30:17.310
who started during the time
period we're lookin' at.

30:17.310 --> 30:18.310
One woman.

30:18.310 --> 30:19.810
Two men.

30:19.810 --> 30:23.350
Alan Billbon teaches
clinical psychology.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.550
Who's the other one?

30:26.220 --> 30:27.290
Peter Needham.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.890
Did you know
about this, Alex?

30:28.890 --> 30:31.160
Not till a couple
of minutes ago.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.430
Trivette, run a background check
on both these guys.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.260
Look, Alex,

30:35.260 --> 30:37.630
we think Perkins is the guy.

30:37.630 --> 30:38.630
All right,

30:38.630 --> 30:39.900
he was workin'
at the university

30:39.900 --> 30:41.270
when all three attacks
took place.

30:41.270 --> 30:44.170
And he's been arrested before
for sex crimes.

30:44.170 --> 30:46.810
Yeah, but it's all
peeping Tom stuff.

30:46.810 --> 30:49.040
Why would he all of the sudden
change his pattern

30:49.040 --> 30:50.380
and start attacking women?

30:50.380 --> 30:52.080
What about the evidence?

30:52.080 --> 30:53.810
Susan's scarf, the ski mask?

30:53.810 --> 30:55.210
Well, maybe,
like he said,

30:55.220 --> 30:57.520
he did find them.
Or someone planted it on him.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.220
You don't seriously believe
that it could be Peter.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.590
Alex, he's a suspect.

31:01.590 --> 31:04.560
Whether I believe it or not
doesn't really matter.

31:11.530 --> 31:12.760
TRIVETTE:
Professor Billbon,

31:12.770 --> 31:14.770
what you're saying is
you have no problem

31:14.770 --> 31:16.700
with professors
dating coeds.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.910
Is this a great job or what?

31:23.940 --> 31:26.110
Okay, seriously...

31:28.480 --> 31:31.120
Sure, everybody's
goin' a little crazy now

31:31.120 --> 31:32.920
because of all this
sexual harassment stuff.

31:34.190 --> 31:37.390
And the schools
all have rules about it.

31:37.390 --> 31:40.130
But, hey,
everybody's doin' it.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.990
Why not?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.730
This is a college campus.

31:44.730 --> 31:47.070
And all the women here
are way past the age of consent.

31:47.070 --> 31:48.630
Why did you leave RMU?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.270
Time to move on.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.140
Did you quit
or were you thrown out?

31:56.610 --> 31:58.610
Hey...

31:58.610 --> 32:04.120
I did not invite you guys into
my office to be insulted, okay?

32:04.120 --> 32:06.390
You asked me your questions,
I answered 'em.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.350
You're sure you've never met
the three girls that

32:08.360 --> 32:09.890
were attacked
here on campus.
No.

32:10.490 --> 32:11.490
Alan?

32:11.490 --> 32:12.490
Yeah.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.590
You have a class
in five minutes.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.430
Okay. Thanks, darlin'.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.930
( sighs )

32:24.400 --> 32:26.910
Do you guys really think

32:26.910 --> 32:29.040
that I'm the kind of guy
that has to get his jollies

32:29.040 --> 32:31.040
by raping women?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.410
You gotta be kiddin' me.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.590
Look, this--
This is nuts, man.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.120
This is absolutely nuts.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.330
All-- All the girls
in my office are freakin' out.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.430
Alan, I talked to
the head of security.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.200
He tells me we actually
had fewer incidents

32:51.200 --> 32:52.300
than most schools
our size.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.630
That's pretty good,
if you ask me.

32:53.630 --> 32:55.400
Then why do we have
Texas Rangers comin' here,

32:55.400 --> 32:56.400
askin' questions?

32:56.400 --> 32:57.940
Alex,
where you goin'?

32:57.940 --> 33:00.270
Oh. I was just gonna
go grab a bite to eat.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.270
Mind if I tag along?

33:01.270 --> 33:02.270
I'd like that.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.440
Who's the beautiful lady?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.940
Oh, Alex Cahill,
this is Alan Billbon.

33:05.950 --> 33:07.610
Alex Cahill,
y-you teach law classes

33:07.610 --> 33:08.750
in the evenings,
don't you?

33:08.750 --> 33:09.750
Yes, I do.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.250
I'm enjoying it very much.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.650
Nice meeting you.
Maybe, uh...

33:13.650 --> 33:16.590
Maybe I can come by your class
sometime and-- And observe.

33:16.590 --> 33:17.860
Sure.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.030
See you later, Peter.

33:20.030 --> 33:21.730
See ya, Alan.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.830
Campus Casanova.

33:24.830 --> 33:26.500
Pay no attention.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.030
Well, he admits
to dating students.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.600
Yeah. Exclusively,
from the look of things.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.840
But that doesn't give us enough
to prove anything, huh?

33:36.010 --> 33:37.580
As much as I hate to admit it,
he's right.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.650
He doesn't seem like the type
who'd have to resort to rape

33:40.650 --> 33:41.650
to get what he wanted.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.150
( phone rings )

33:44.180 --> 33:45.680
Walker.

33:45.690 --> 33:46.680
For you.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.820
Yeah. Trivette.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.320
Hi, George.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.260
You sure?

33:55.060 --> 33:57.300
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.430
The lab?

33:59.430 --> 34:03.200
Yeah. Stan Perkins
is definitely not our rapist.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.040
Wrong blood type.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.200
That leaves Peter Needham.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.610
Yep.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.380
We better cut Perkins loose.

34:11.139 --> 34:12.340
Ranger Trivette.
Yeah.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.409
This just came for you.

34:13.409 --> 34:14.449
Thanks.

34:17.719 --> 34:20.219
Reports on both professors.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.389
( phone rings )

34:26.030 --> 34:27.030
Walker.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.560
Hi, Laura.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.260
I'll be right there.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.260
What's up?

34:33.429 --> 34:34.770
Nypo.

34:37.810 --> 34:41.310
WOMAN ( over PA ):
<i> Doctor Forest,</i>
<i> dial 118, please.</i>

34:41.310 --> 34:44.810
<i> Doctor Forest,</i>
<i> please dial one-one-eight.</i>

34:46.310 --> 34:49.050
What kind of man
would do this to a woman?

34:50.179 --> 34:51.280
( muffled ):
Tony?

34:51.290 --> 34:53.219
I'm here, Mom.
I'm here.

34:53.219 --> 34:57.020
You...watch out
for Curt.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.190
( whispers ):
Okay.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.120
Don't let him
get you. Don't--

35:00.130 --> 35:01.130
It's-- It's fine.

35:01.130 --> 35:02.460
It's fine, Mom.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.200
He-- He didn't get me,
and I'm all right, and--

35:05.200 --> 35:07.130
And just go back
to sleep.

35:07.130 --> 35:09.300
Just-- Just relax,
all right?

35:14.410 --> 35:15.810
Tony tried
to call you.

35:15.810 --> 35:17.310
When he couldn't get
in touch with you,

35:17.310 --> 35:19.340
he called me, and I met him
over at the house.

35:19.350 --> 35:23.420
It was awful.
There was blood everywhere.

35:23.420 --> 35:26.420
She was barely alive.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.120
Well, a warrant
for Nypo's arrest

35:28.120 --> 35:31.120
is being drawn up right now.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.820
I'm gonna serve it
personally.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.000
Well, Tony's gonna stay
at my house.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.160
At least for tonight.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.560
Okay, good.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.170
First I've gotta
take him downtown.

35:41.170 --> 35:44.340
The DA's office is waiting
to take his statement.

35:45.570 --> 35:48.310
I'm gonna, um, stay here
just for a little bit

35:48.310 --> 35:50.640
until she falls asleep,
okay?

35:50.640 --> 35:53.150
Yeah, sure.
We'll wait outside.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.450
Okay.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.320
I'm gonna have
to leave.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.060
I forgot I've got
a parent conference.

36:04.060 --> 36:05.360
Okay, when we're finished,

36:05.360 --> 36:07.160
I'll drop Tony off
at your house.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.230
Should we set an extra place
for you for dinner?

36:10.230 --> 36:12.060
That'd be great.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.430
Better take a look
at this.

36:22.210 --> 36:23.880
When he was
at Farragut University,

36:23.880 --> 36:26.280
the incidence of rape
went up 30 percent.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.150
Same at the other schools
he taught at.

36:28.150 --> 36:29.750
And the m.o.
for some of those rapes

36:29.750 --> 36:31.020
fits the guy
we're lookin' for.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.150
Better get a copy
of this report to Alex.

36:33.150 --> 36:34.450
I'll fax it to her.

36:34.450 --> 36:36.150
When we're finished
with Tony,

36:36.160 --> 36:37.990
let's go meet Alex
at her class.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.320
All right.

36:51.170 --> 36:52.540
This fax just came in
for you

36:52.540 --> 36:53.910
from Ranger Trivette's
office.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.440
You know,
about the college professor.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.110
Just put it on my desk.
I'm late for class.

36:57.110 --> 36:58.280
Well, there's
a note on it,

36:58.280 --> 36:59.410
says it's important.

36:59.410 --> 37:00.750
Thank you.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.620
( students chatting
indistinctly )

37:06.650 --> 37:07.990
WOMAN:
Are you gonna come?

37:07.990 --> 37:09.250
WOMAN 2:
Well, we'll talk.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.100
Hi.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.430
Hi.

37:21.430 --> 37:22.600
Need any help?

37:22.600 --> 37:24.100
No.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.770
All set?

37:25.770 --> 37:27.110
Yeah.

37:41.590 --> 37:42.850
Where's Alex Cahill?

37:42.860 --> 37:44.490
They just left.

37:44.490 --> 37:45.490
They?

37:45.490 --> 37:46.760
Yeah, she and Professor Needham.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.190
Do you know
where they went?

37:48.200 --> 37:49.190
No.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.200
(<i> tense theme playing</i> )

37:59.370 --> 38:00.970
ALEX:
Why don't you drop me
over at my car

38:00.970 --> 38:02.210
and I'll meet you at C.D.'s.

38:02.210 --> 38:04.180
PETER:
Well, why don't we just
take my car.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.880
I've got an early
arraignment tomorrow.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.610
I'm not gonna be able
to that stay that long.

38:07.610 --> 38:08.750
Hmm, I see.

38:08.750 --> 38:09.750
Oh.
Oh!

38:09.750 --> 38:10.820
Here, it's okay.

38:10.820 --> 38:11.980
I got it.
I'm sorry.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.390
Here you go.

38:13.390 --> 38:15.890
Peter, I don't think
you should be looking at that.

38:15.890 --> 38:17.960
I haven't had a chance
to read it myself.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.960
I don't believe this.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.030
( grunts )

38:27.600 --> 38:30.340

38:30.340 --> 38:32.140
What do you want
from me, huh?

38:32.140 --> 38:33.200
What do you want?

38:33.210 --> 38:34.210
Nothing.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.470
You send Rangers
to my office

38:36.480 --> 38:38.340
to harass me.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.480
Make me out to be--

38:39.480 --> 38:41.310
To be some kind
of a pervert.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.750
Ruin my reputation.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.720
No.
Shut up!

38:44.720 --> 38:46.120
You women think
that you--

38:46.120 --> 38:47.720
You rule the whole damn world,
don't you?

38:47.720 --> 38:49.420
You think that you're better
than us.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.020
Well, let me
tell you something.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.620
You're only good
for one thing,

38:52.630 --> 38:54.260
and, uh, I'm gonna

38:54.260 --> 38:56.230
give you
a little demonstration.

( grunts )

39:04.770 --> 39:06.340
Come here.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.270
Maybe they've
already gone.

39:08.270 --> 39:11.010
Yeah, you're
probably right.

Alex, you okay?

39:21.890 --> 39:23.220
Peter.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.120
( Peter groans )

39:26.130 --> 39:27.730
Peter, are you all right?

39:27.730 --> 39:29.330
( whispers ):
Oh, God.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.070
Got Billbon
locked up downtown.

39:39.070 --> 39:40.300
Yeah, get this.

39:40.310 --> 39:42.310
His attorney says
he's a manic-depressive.

39:42.310 --> 39:43.840
He doesn't remember
any of the attacks.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.180
Don't worry, we figure we're
gonna lock up the attorney too.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.250
Good for you, Alex.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.450
Heard you beat the hell
out of that rapist.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.820
I've never been so scared
in my entire life.

39:52.820 --> 39:55.020
It's a good thing
you listened to Walker

39:55.020 --> 39:56.520
about those
self-defense classes.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.790
Yes, it is.

39:57.790 --> 39:58.920
( cell phone rings )

39:58.920 --> 40:00.260
Excuse me.

40:01.990 --> 40:03.490
Yeah. Trivette.

40:11.270 --> 40:13.670
Excuse me.

40:14.410 --> 40:17.710
So, um, how's Peter?

40:17.710 --> 40:20.680
He has a concussion.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.880
They're gonna keep him overnight
for observation,

40:22.880 --> 40:25.480
but I'm sure
he'll be fine.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.880
Let's go see him.

Walker.

Laura called
the office.

Tony took off
on his bike

40:38.470 --> 40:41.700
about a half-hour
after we dropped him off.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.330
You don't think
he'd be foolish enough

40:43.340 --> 40:45.200
to go after Nypo.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.110
C.D. will
take you home.

goin' on here?

41:34.550 --> 41:37.890
I said we don't move anything
until everything calms down.

41:37.890 --> 41:39.660
Look, we got us a hornet's nest
stirred up here

41:39.660 --> 41:40.730
with this Ranger Walker.

41:40.730 --> 41:43.160
Walker's my problem,
not yours.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.560
I'll handle it.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.100
Yeah, well, thanks to you,
so far he's all our problems,

41:47.100 --> 41:48.470
and you haven't handled it.

41:48.470 --> 41:51.240
Now, what I say
around here goes.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.840
I don't pay you
to have opinions.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.640
You don't pay me, period.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.710
We just became
equal partners.

41:57.710 --> 41:59.310
Do we get our usual cut?

42:00.610 --> 42:03.920
Double, when Walker
and his partner are dead.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.650

a kick in the head?

42:09.260 --> 42:12.320
I could go-- I could go
to jail for this.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.260
I don't care.

You're goin' down, Nypo.

42:20.570 --> 42:21.930
( shouting ):
Did you hear me?

42:21.940 --> 42:24.440
Yeah. I heard you, kid.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.540
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

42:27.710 --> 42:29.070
Don't have
the guts?

42:29.080 --> 42:32.240
Walker's got your head
all twisted up

42:32.240 --> 42:33.550
with the rules of the game.

42:33.550 --> 42:35.550
Only thing
he doesn't know is,

42:35.550 --> 42:37.320
there are no rules.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.820
Your turn, Tony.

42:47.930 --> 42:51.530
Great feeling,
ain't it? Huh?

42:51.530 --> 42:52.530
Drop it, Nypo!

42:53.400 --> 42:54.900
Against the wall.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.130
Stay put.

Look, it's only
drug dealing right now.

Don't make it murder.

43:03.780 --> 43:05.440
Come on, Nypo, he's right.
Put the gun down.

three to five--

to the teacher.

to stay put.

Think you can
point at him

and tell a jury
what he's done?

Wait. We-- We
totaled this.

Don't.

it's not so bad.

No, it's not so bad,

and little paint there.
