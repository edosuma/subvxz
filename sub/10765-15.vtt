00:05.438 --> 00:08.271
It is so nice to have the house

00:08.341 --> 00:10.138
It sure is.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.101
Now, why is it that we wanted kids?

00:13.380 --> 00:15.610
'Cause of the way you get them.

00:38.938 --> 00:39.962
What, what?

00:42.876 --> 00:43.865
Yeah.

00:44.577 --> 00:48.206
AII right. Hey, Aunt Viv, UncIe PhiI,
we did it, we won again. We 4-and-0.

00:48.281 --> 00:52.047
And at our next game, there's gonna be
a recruiter from Georgetown University.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.951
That's great, kids. Why don't you
go upstairs, get my waIIet...

00:55.021 --> 00:57.683
and take your friends to the movies?
In Pittsburgh.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.425
Sorry about the unexpected guests, Dad.

01:01.494 --> 01:04.429
And, as manager of the team,
I take fuII responsibiIity.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.330
That's very honorabIe, son.
You're grounded.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.895
PhiIip, I think it's nice that the kids feeI
weIcome and want to be around us.

01:12.972 --> 01:17.671
ActuaIIy, we got kicked out of six other
peopIe's cribs and a 7-EIeven parking Iot.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.777
But, you mind
if we just hang around here...

01:20.847 --> 01:23.475
and, you know, order a coupIe of pizzas
or something?

01:23.550 --> 01:26.917
It is a very speciaI night
for you, WiII. Sure.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.851
AII right. Thanks a Iot, UncIe PhiI.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.220
And you know what, man,
this just feeIs great...

01:31.291 --> 01:34.590
'cause I remember a time when
me and you didn't get aIong so good.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.255
AII the yeIIing and screaming.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.322
You teIIing me, ''Get on the first pIane
back to PhiIIy.''

01:40.400 --> 01:43.062
Hey, but this is now,
and that was this morning.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.681
Yo, Ty, man, what took you so Iong?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.810
Hey, you ever try going
to seven fast food joints on a city bus?

03:06.886 --> 03:08.547
No, I'm saving that for prom night.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.386
Okay, you got your ribs.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.753
-Oh, man, you got your fried chicken.
-Yes, sir.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.828
-Your hot wings.
-Yeah!

03:16.896 --> 03:19.865
Your smokey Iinks,
your barbecue kieIbasa...

03:19.933 --> 03:22.265
and a bean pie fresh from the corner.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.427
Yes, sir.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.172
-Hey, you want some hot sauce on that?
-Oh, yeah.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.493
Needs a IittIe bit more.

03:55.535 --> 03:57.366
WiII, you shouIdn't be eating that garbage!

03:57.437 --> 04:01.396
Everyone knows, whiIe you're in training
no fats, no chocoIate, and no women!

04:01.474 --> 04:05.570
Then I shouId probabIy canceI my date
with that fat, chocoIate woman.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.878
WiII, you pitifuI MaaIox poster chiId.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.645
Get that grease buffet out of here
and Iet's go to the game.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.880
MaIibu Prep is pIaying
BrentIey High tonight...

04:14.954 --> 04:17.718
and I want you to check out
MaIibu's guard, Marcus Stokes.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.418
I'm from PhiIIy, homes, ain't nobody
from MaIibu gonna beat me in basketbaII.

04:21.494 --> 04:25.055
Besides, I'm the greatest,
I'm a bad man, and I'm pretty.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.466
WiII, you better Iisten to me
if you want me to be your manager.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.374
My manager? I don't even want you
to be my cousin.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.741
I didn't hear that.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.509
He say he don't even want you
to be his cousin.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.509
Fine.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.577
I'II just go to the game myseIf,
and when I get back...

04:48.655 --> 04:53.251
I'II teII Dad that IittIe circIe in your waIIet's
not your Iucky haIf-doIIar.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.826
ShaII we take my car or the VoIvo?

05:04.103 --> 05:08.233
<i>Malibu leads by 10. Stokes passes</i>
<i>to Jameson, Jameson back to Stokes.</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:10.799
<i>Stokes calls time-out.</i>

05:13.846 --> 05:17.612
I'II say one thing for MaIibu,
the babes are primo-deIecto.

05:19.552 --> 05:20.712
Surf's up.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.419
And that ain't aII. That must be jam,
'cause jeIIy don't shake Iike that.

05:29.362 --> 05:33.093
Yo, SIimmy, need some heIp
with your African American studies?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.999
We can go to my pIace
and Iet freedom ring.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.202
<i>We're in the final quarter of this ball game.</i>

05:40.273 --> 05:42.298
<i>Stokes will take the ball out at halfcourt.</i>

05:42.375 --> 05:45.105
<i>He passes in to Miller,</i>
<i>Miller back to Stokes.</i>

05:45.178 --> 05:46.839
<i>Stokes shoots the jumper.</i>

05:46.913 --> 05:49.143
<i>Bingo! This kid doesn't miss.</i>

05:53.786 --> 05:55.549
<i>Brentley down, shoots, no soap.</i>

05:55.621 --> 05:57.589
<i>They've been throwing up dead bricks</i>
<i>all night.</i>

05:57.657 --> 06:00.524
<i>Pelicans rebound. Marcus the Great</i>
<i>brings the ball down court.</i>

06:00.593 --> 06:02.584
<i>He looks left, spins right.</i>

06:02.662 --> 06:04.391
<i>Swish! Stokes is a one-man gang!</i>

06:04.464 --> 06:07.524
Wow! Did you see Marcus Stokes jump?

06:07.600 --> 06:08.760
Luck.

06:08.835 --> 06:09.893
How is that Iuck?

06:09.969 --> 06:13.063
He's Iucky I'm not out there.
CarIton, the brother's from MaIibu.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.870
The onIy tough break he had
is when the Izod shop ran out of pink.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.203
God, I hate when that happens.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.917
Hey, Coach SmiIey, what's going on?

06:28.988 --> 06:31.684
Shut up, Smith.
Can't you see I'm incognito?

06:31.758 --> 06:33.487
Give me 20 Iaps first thing Monday.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.392
No, wait, I don't want you hurting
your Iegs before the big game.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.555
Banks, do his Iaps for him.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.459
So, what do you see, Coach?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.368
Not a damn thing, WiII,
it's part of the disguise.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.467
<i>Stokes has the ball, he moves to his right.</i>

06:50.042 --> 06:53.773
<i>Drives to the hoop,</i>
<i>a reverse lay-up. He scores!</i>

06:54.380 --> 06:56.007
<i>Stokes dribbles.</i>

06:56.082 --> 06:58.983
<i>Takes a pass,</i>
<i>takes it strong to the hoop again. lt's in!</i>

06:59.051 --> 07:02.145
<i>Stokes has done everything tonight</i>
<i>except sell hot dogs.</i>

07:02.221 --> 07:04.348
<i>Stokes steals the ball, drives the paint.</i>

07:04.424 --> 07:06.915
<i>Oh, my goodness, how sweet it is.</i>

07:06.993 --> 07:10.292
Marcus!

07:11.898 --> 07:14.162
<i>Three seconds left, Stokes with a jumper.</i>

07:14.233 --> 07:17.430
<i>Swish! The game is over!</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:22.231
<i>ln my opinion, Marcus Stokes is gonna</i>
<i>be one hell of a college basketball player.</i>

07:32.618 --> 07:34.483
Hey, Marcus, what's up, man?

07:34.554 --> 07:38.285
WiII Smith, you probabIy recognize me
from my picture in the sports page.

07:38.357 --> 07:41.121
They said that
I'm a superbIy weII-oiIed machine...

07:41.194 --> 07:44.459
with the face of an angeI
and the body of a god.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.430
Maybe that's not an exact quote.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.427
No, I don't recognize the face, brother.

07:51.504 --> 07:55.133
But I do recognize them ears.
They covered up haIf of ''Dear Abby.''

07:57.643 --> 08:00.373
Hey, you had a pretty cute game
out there tonight.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.244
I'm gIad you enjoyed it,
'cause I'm gonna do the same thing...

08:03.316 --> 08:04.943
to your butt next week.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.320
I'm gIad you're famiIiar with that...

08:08.387 --> 08:12.084
because my butt is the onIy part
of my anatomy you gonna see next week.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.216
Oh, reaIIy?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.954
I'II bring a coupIe of umbreIIas
for you and that scout...

08:16.028 --> 08:18.428
because I'm gonna be raining jump shots.

08:19.732 --> 08:23.293
Hey, hoId up, I'm the onIy reason
that scout is coming in the first pIace.

08:23.369 --> 08:26.634
OnIy scout Iooking for you
is trying to seII you some cookies.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.542
I Iike your styIe, WiII,
I definiteIy Iike your styIe...

08:35.615 --> 08:38.482
but Iet me be the first to congratuIate you
ahead of time...

08:38.551 --> 08:41.645
for being voted
Most LikeIy to Bag my Groceries.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.588
Yeah? WeII, I got just one thing to say
to you, Mr. Hot Shot.

08:45.658 --> 08:48.684
You may be taII and good-Iooking
and a good basketbaII pIayer...

08:48.761 --> 08:50.558
but you're not that nice.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.967
You back again
for another pre-game haircut?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.028
How you doing, young bIood?

09:00.106 --> 09:03.371
Just a poor bIack man
trying to make it in BeI-Air, Mr. NeIson.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.000
What do you say, Joe?

09:08.781 --> 09:11.181
Hey, somebody want to know the future?

09:12.184 --> 09:13.811
The girIs Iike it.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.855
I'm sure they do,
they can check their makeup in it.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.293
I heard about your Iast game.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.725
Boy, you was awesome.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.194
How many points you score?

09:24.263 --> 09:26.595
A mere 30 points...

09:26.666 --> 09:31.160
an insignificant 18 rebounds,
a minuscuIe 14 assists.

09:31.370 --> 09:35.739
In other words, for a smaII fee, I might be
persuaded to date your daughters.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.570
Boy, you ain't never gonna be that good.

09:41.380 --> 09:45.783
Boy, back in my day, we used to pIay
basketbaII down in North CaroIina.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.787
We ain't had no sneakers, so we pIayed
in high-top combat boots.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.653
And we ain't had no basketbaII,
so we used a brick.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.289
And we ain't had no hoop...

09:56.362 --> 10:00.128
so Cousin Junebug wouId hoId his arms
out in a circIe Iike this.

10:00.199 --> 10:04.067
And aII day Iong we sIam dunked
that brick off Junebug's head.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.734
Them was tough days, boy.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.104
Good thing you aII wasn't into archery.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.771
AII right.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.509
Now here's my hero.
How you doing, Marcus?

10:17.583 --> 10:19.244
-What's up, everybody?
-Hey.

10:19.318 --> 10:23.277
Joe, nice hair. You keep saving these up,
one day you'II have a sideburn.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.588
Just because the roof bIew off
don't mean there ain't a Iog on the fire.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.032
So, what is up, LittIe WiIIie?

10:34.100 --> 10:36.534
Ain't nothing to it, shorty.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.264
I see you sIumming, what you doing
down here in the hood?

10:39.338 --> 10:42.273
This may be the hood to you,
brother, but this is home to me.

10:42.341 --> 10:43.569
What're you taIking about?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.135
I Iive two bIocks away from here, man.
Born and raised.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.113
Wait, I thought you Iived out in MaIibu.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.876
I know you thought I did.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.680
You thought I was
some snot-nosed, candy-pants preppy.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.517
But I'm your worst nightmare
on a basketbaII court, money.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.784
I'm a homeboy, just Iike you.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.415
So, wait a minute.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.157
You ride a bus 20 miIes a day
to MaIibu Prep?

11:05.231 --> 11:06.357
Nope.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.792
I run.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.568
Bingo.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.270
My main man.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.960
WiII, what you doing back so soon?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.730
You know my haircuts
don't have no warranties.

11:45.271 --> 11:48.729
Tonight's the big game, I wanted
to come in and get a speciaI trim.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.744
Don't cut me too short, though.
I don't want you give me no ''Hair Jordan.''

11:52.812 --> 11:54.871
If the peopIe say you Iook pretty tonight...

11:54.947 --> 11:57.177
be sure and mention
NeIson's GoIden Shears.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.685
Our motto is: ''It may be nappy,
but we'II make it snappy.''

12:02.555 --> 12:04.455
Has Marcus been around?

12:04.523 --> 12:06.218
I seen him once or twice.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.257
He got his game face on?

12:08.427 --> 12:09.792
Afraid so.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.758
So he wasn't fronting?

12:12.031 --> 12:13.862
Hey, he reaIIy does Iive around here?

12:13.933 --> 12:16.094
Yeah, he grew up right around the corner.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.999
Come from a good famiIy, too.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.005
Got six of the prettiest sisters
you ever seen.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.065
I beIieve the oIdest one think
I'm kind of cute.

12:25.845 --> 12:30.339
Marcus been pIaying baII over at Harriet
Tubman Park since he was 6 years oId.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.247
Tough IittIe rascaI he was, too.

12:32.318 --> 12:35.219
He used to pIay on the asphaIt
in his socks.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.755
Mother couIdn't afford sneakers,
you know.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.852
Sounds Iike he was about as tough
as I was.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.087
Yeah, I used to pIay barefoot...

12:43.395 --> 12:44.623
on gIass.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.059
Why?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.999
Marcus' mother been working
at the phone company...

12:51.070 --> 12:52.264
ever since I can remember.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.705
And the kid's got so many jobs,
he couId be Jamaican.

12:57.042 --> 13:01.479
My mom had about four jobs,
and I had three myseIf.

13:01.547 --> 13:05.347
I was the onIy kid in preschooI
who knew how to downshift a big rig.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.383
And I'm gonna amaze
that Georgetown scout tonight.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.151
A few years from now
I'II be dunking baskets in the NBA...

13:12.224 --> 13:15.193
Marcus wiII be dunking donuts
in a deep fryer.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.161
Which pro team you gonna pIay with?

13:17.229 --> 13:20.130
My daddy says I can pIay with a pro team.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.735
Not so fast, Junior,
you got a ways to go yet.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.959
''Junior''?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.572
Yeah, WiII, this is my son.

13:43.989 --> 13:48.255
<i>This is my son. My son.</i>

13:51.697 --> 13:53.756
WeII, here we are.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.899
Have the house aII to ourseIves.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.466
AII aIone.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.870
Just you and me.

14:28.033 --> 14:32.561
WiII, I got Tyson, HoIyfieId, Dr. J...

14:32.638 --> 14:35.072
Dr. Ruth, and Dr. Pepper.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.706
OnIy in America.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.945
Sorry things didn't work out
at the donut shop.

14:41.013 --> 14:45.074
And another thing, take this $1,000 biII
and wipe your baby's nose.

14:52.658 --> 14:56.856
Go, WiII.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.370
Wait a minute, this is whack.

15:06.438 --> 15:09.032
Hey, I don't even know if this baby is mine.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.543
HeIIo, Dada?

15:12.778 --> 15:15.144
How you going to pIay a baby?

15:22.554 --> 15:23.543
<i>Will.</i>

15:26.191 --> 15:27.488
Wake up.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.754
Come on, it's time for the game.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.029
Oh, man.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.890
I dreamed you had hair Iike Don King.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.060
Did I Iook taIIer?

15:40.139 --> 15:43.336
So, you ready to show that scout
what we're made of?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.802
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Guess so?

15:46.879 --> 15:49.439
What kind of attitude is that for a champ?
Come on.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.949
Hey, CarIton.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.008
You, you think it's rough having a kid?

15:54.086 --> 15:55.178
I don't think so.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.314
You just hand out cigars
and hope its head rounds out.

16:05.364 --> 16:09.164
AII right, men, we've come a Iong way
and I just want to say, ''Good Iuck.''

16:09.234 --> 16:11.429
That, and pass it to WiII.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.006
One, two, three, BeI-Air!

16:22.247 --> 16:24.272
AII right, it's showtime, baby!

16:24.650 --> 16:27.585
Yes, sir, and I am
the master of ceremonies.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.750
<i>And here's the tip-off.</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:31.483
<i>Look at Will Smith leap!</i>

16:31.557 --> 16:34.583
<i>He taps the ball to Jones,</i>
<i>Jones back to Smith.</i>

16:34.660 --> 16:37.493
<i>And Smith draws first blood</i>
<i>for Bel-Air Prep.</i>

16:38.464 --> 16:41.058
<i>Marcus Stokes has the ball for Malibu.</i>

16:41.133 --> 16:43.931
<i>Driving the lane and scoring.</i>

16:46.538 --> 16:50.099
<i>Stokes looking for the open man,</i>
<i>takes the jumper for two points.</i>

16:52.778 --> 16:54.678
<i>Will Smith coming right back at it.</i>

16:54.747 --> 16:56.214
<i>ln your face!</i>

16:56.281 --> 16:59.341
<i>Call the fire department,</i>
<i>Stokes and Smith are smoking.</i>

17:03.789 --> 17:08.726
<i>Smith steals the ball, driving the lane,</i>
<i>a lay-up! He's poetry in motion.</i>

17:08.926 --> 17:12.157
<i>Marcus has the ball, he drives, swish!</i>

17:12.231 --> 17:14.222
<i>lt's been Smith and Stokes all night.</i>

17:14.299 --> 17:17.097
<i>Jump shot, Will Smith. He's got 30 points.</i>

17:19.003 --> 17:21.837
<i>Stokes shoots the jumper.</i>
<i>lt's money in the bank.</i>

17:21.906 --> 17:25.741
<i>Stokes falls back on defense. This has</i>
<i>been an old-fashioned barnburner.</i>

17:25.810 --> 17:27.403
<i>Bel-Air Prep by two points.</i>

17:27.479 --> 17:29.743
<i>Stokes and Smith could start</i>
<i>their own pro team!</i>

17:29.815 --> 17:32.807
<i>Holy mackerel,</i>
<i>another two points for Will Smith.</i>

17:32.985 --> 17:35.078
<i>Stokes comes right back at him.</i>

17:35.154 --> 17:37.452
<i>He drives, and lays it in.</i>

17:37.523 --> 17:41.118
<i>These two kids are magnificent.</i>
<i>Have you ever seen anything like it?</i>

17:41.193 --> 17:45.892
<i>Smith dribbles up court.</i>
<i>He stops, he pops, it drops. Two points.</i>

17:45.964 --> 17:49.400
<i>This one is too close to call and</i>
<i>these fans are loving every minute of it.</i>

17:49.468 --> 17:51.333
<i>Stokes looks tired</i>
<i>but there's fire in his eyes.</i>

17:51.403 --> 17:53.200
<i>Smith is playing the game of his life.</i>

17:53.272 --> 17:55.638
<i>Stokes shoots. ln your face, Will Smith.</i>

17:55.707 --> 17:57.902
<i>lt doesn't get any better than this!</i>

18:00.779 --> 18:04.215
<i>Smith bringing the ball down court.</i>
<i>His face a mask of concentration.</i>

18:04.283 --> 18:07.047
<i>He drives towards Stokes.</i>
<i>He fires the rock.</i>

18:07.119 --> 18:10.452
<i>ln your face, Marcus Stokes.</i>
<i>Bel-Air Prep by one point.</i>

18:10.522 --> 18:12.649
<i>Time-out with 15 seconds left.</i>

18:12.724 --> 18:14.316
AII right, men, now think defense.

18:14.393 --> 18:18.523
WiII, Stokes is your man, I want you
to stick to him Iike white on rice.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.433
Sorry, it's a bad anaIogy.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.370
-One, two, three, BeI Air!
-Let's go.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.051
Hey, what's going on, UncIe PhiI?

19:55.427 --> 19:56.655
You okay?

19:57.396 --> 19:58.761
Yeah, you know.

19:59.498 --> 20:02.763
Guess I reaIIy bIew it
in front of that scout tonight, huh?

20:02.834 --> 20:05.302
Son, you can't come down on yourseIf
for Iosing.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.999
Sometimes you win, sometimes you Iose.
There'II be other scouts.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.440
I know. I just feIt Iike
I reaIIy Iet everybody down.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.341
My game
just wouIdn't come together tonight.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.540
Trust me, WiII.
I know it doesn't feeI Iike it right now...

20:16.615 --> 20:18.105
but what they say is true.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.208
Winning reaIIy isn't everything.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.118
Yeah, weII, it is to Marcus Stokes.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.057
How you doing, sir? I'm Marcus Stokes.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.494
-I'm PhiIip Banks, WiII's uncIe.
-Nice to meet you.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.226
-You pIay a heII of a game, son.
-Thank you, sir.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.030
-WiII, we'II see you at home?
-Okay.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.730
Hey, man, I was waiting around for you
in the Iocker room.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.605
Why'd you Iet me go around you Iike that?

20:44.676 --> 20:47.042
What, you tripping, man?
I didn't Iet you go around me.

20:47.112 --> 20:50.240
I know your game, WiII.
You Iet me go around you.

20:50.315 --> 20:53.751
If you were gonna pIay Iike that,
why didn't you just sit in the stands?

20:53.819 --> 20:55.980
Look, come on, man,
you impressed the scout.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.682
You'II go to a Division One coIIege,
then you'II go pro.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.818
You'II be abIe to get your kid everything.
What're you beefing about?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.191
Oh, I get it.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.994
'Cause I got a kid,
I'm some kind of charity case?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.931
Let's get something straight, homey.

21:10.002 --> 21:14.564
My situation does not define who I am,
I define who I am.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.968
Look, man. I got Iucky, aII right.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.412
You know, I got a rich uncIe.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.879
A Iot of brothers
coming from where we come from...

21:23.949 --> 21:25.576
they don't have the same opportunities.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.414
That's your ticket.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.679
You know something, my BeI-Air brother?

21:30.756 --> 21:33.691
You been watching
too many made-for-TV movies.

21:35.027 --> 21:38.588
Hey, Iook, man, I'm from PhiIIy,
I know it ain't easy to make it.

21:38.664 --> 21:42.122
What? To make it to the pros?
It's damn near impossibIe.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.294
Look, I'm better than good,
tiII I break my ankIe, that is.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.065
Then I ain't worth a dime.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.164
I'm not depending on this.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.868
I'm depending on this.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.843
My b-baII schoIarship is gonna get me
a free education in engineering...

21:54.913 --> 21:58.076
so that I can provide for my famiIy
with my mind.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.884
-You don't even want to pIay pro?
-Yo, I ain't no fooI, now.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.979
If somebody offered me a miIIion doIIars
to dribbIe a basketbaII...

22:05.057 --> 22:07.321
you better beIieve I'm gonna take it.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.150
AII due respect, my brother...

22:09.227 --> 22:12.162
I don't think nobody's gonna offer you
no miIIion doIIars.

22:13.365 --> 22:16.232
What I'm saying is
the odds of that happening are sIim.

22:16.301 --> 22:20.863
Me getting an education that's gonna Iast
me a Iifetime are the odds that I'm taking.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.707
You know, you are a pretty deep brother.

22:23.775 --> 22:24.799
Yeah.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.401
And I'm a better baIIpIayer than you, too.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.810
Them's be fighting words. Let's do it.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.543
I thought you'd never ask.

22:32.617 --> 22:35.051
-Hey, that's what you want, right?
-That's what I want.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.021
You sure that's what you want?
AII right. You're driving.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.521
-You sure this is what you want?
-Give it to me as hard as you can.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.464
When you go home you gotta teII them
what I did to you, right?

22:48.533 --> 22:51.263
-What did you say?
-I'm gonna give it to you reaI hard.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.770
Where you going?

22:53.839 --> 22:57.434
Take a Iook at you. Smith has the baII.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.310
He dribbIes, he drives between the Iegs.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.246
He stops, he pops. And it's good!
The crowd goes wiId.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.578
Oh, Smith hurt his ankIe.

23:07.085 --> 23:10.782
<i>He hurt his ankle. lt's over, he cannot play.</i>
<i>Smith wins, 1-0.</i>
