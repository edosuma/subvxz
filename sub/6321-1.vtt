00:42.009 --> 00:46.222
Coolidge College was
established in 18...

00:46.305 --> 00:48.724
Who knows this?
It was in your freshman facts.

00:48.808 --> 00:52.645
<i>The first day of spring semester.</i>

00:52.728 --> 00:54.730
<i>A time to say goodbye
to the parents once again,</i>

00:54.814 --> 00:57.233
<i>and say hello to a few
new student bodies.</i>

01:00.778 --> 01:03.364
<i>As for me, well,</i>

01:03.447 --> 01:07.702
<i>I like to start off each semester
with a certain time-honored tradition.</i>

01:07.785 --> 01:09.036
<i>A ritual, if you will,</i>

01:09.120 --> 01:11.747
<i>that allows me to get my head
in the right place.</i>

01:18.045 --> 01:22.383
<i>Okay, so Suk Mae's</i> a <i>little old,</i>

01:22.466 --> 01:25.219
<i>but she is just so damn good.</i>

01:27.221 --> 01:28.681
<i>She's great with these quick jobs,</i>

01:28.764 --> 01:33.019
<i>plus there is no substitute
for decades of experience.</i>

01:33.102 --> 01:35.855
That looks amazing.

01:37.773 --> 01:40.484
That is perfect. You're a pro. A pro.

01:41.611 --> 01:43.321
Hey, look at me.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.739
Pro.

01:46.574 --> 01:51.078
Well, gosh, that was great.
Thanks for the quick job there, Suk Mee.

01:53.122 --> 01:54.457
I need these in 20 minutes.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.293
<i>Super.</i>

02:14.852 --> 02:17.480
We've got a jumper!

02:31.786 --> 02:34.497
Hold on, son.
You don't want to do this.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.123
I didn't want to come here, either.

02:36.207 --> 02:38.125
They made me come!

02:38.209 --> 02:39.752
They made me!

02:42.296 --> 02:44.882
First year can be kind of scary,
can't it, Timmy?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.425
My... My name's not...

02:47.426 --> 02:52.264
But you know what I've learned in my
seven years here at Coolidge, Timmy?

02:52.348 --> 02:55.601
I've learned that you can't treat every
situation as a life-and-death matter,

02:55.685 --> 02:57.561
because you'll die a lot of times.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.690
Write that down.

03:00.773 --> 03:03.234
- I don't have a pen, sir.
- Well, remember that then.

03:04.694 --> 03:06.112
And you know something, Timmy?

03:08.739 --> 03:11.450
I think you've got the balls
to make it here.

03:11.534 --> 03:15.913
Call me nuts...
but I believe in you.

03:18.708 --> 03:22.712
You see, Timmy, you can't let this
lead you all the time.

03:22.795 --> 03:25.256
Sometimes you've gotta heed this.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.884
And I think that you've got a lot of heart
in there, mister, don't you?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.430
Don't you? I mean,
look around you.

03:37.226 --> 03:38.227
Timmy?

03:39.395 --> 03:40.438
Timmy?

03:41.647 --> 03:43.691
Great work, Van. Thanks.

03:43.774 --> 03:45.943
Remember my credo, Timmy!

03:46.026 --> 03:49.113
Don't be a fool.
Stay in school!

03:52.700 --> 03:55.661
God, I love this place.

03:56.787 --> 03:58.622
- Hey, Van.
- Hey, Van the man.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.875
I called you last night, Van.

04:05.129 --> 04:08.132
<i>My name is Van Wilder,
and this is my home.</i>

04:08.215 --> 04:09.633
<i>Coolidge College.</i>

04:19.642 --> 04:23.189
<i>The last, well, seven years
have gone by way too fast.</i>

04:23.272 --> 04:26.817
<i>This school's given me so much,
I just can't seem to give enough back.</i>

04:26.901 --> 04:27.902
That's Van.

04:29.028 --> 04:30.279
That's him.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.531
Oh, my God.

04:33.532 --> 04:34.617
Wow.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.076
Yeah. Wow.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.504
I was the first ever male cheerleader
at Huntington High.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.422
The first ever!

04:49.507 --> 04:52.009
Give me a "V"! Give me an "A"!

04:52.092 --> 04:55.346
Give me an "N"!
What does it spell?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.847
I see a rabbi,

04:56.931 --> 05:00.184
and he's performing a circumcision,
on himself though.

05:02.144 --> 05:03.687
You'll become disciplined.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.272
Your mind will become a weapon.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.538
I'm sorry. You really
just don't fit the profile.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.793
We're just gonna do
a little bit of word association.

05:25.876 --> 05:26.877
Cookies!

05:30.172 --> 05:31.799
Hi. My name is Van.

05:31.882 --> 05:33.133
Hi, my name is Terry.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.181
Let's get it started then,
shall we?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.364
Big finish.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.286
Medic.

06:00.369 --> 06:02.413
Having us both at the same time...

06:02.496 --> 06:03.914
...will definitely lighten your load.

06:03.998 --> 06:05.749
We will bend over backwards for you.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.459
There's nothing
too big we can't handle.

06:07.543 --> 06:09.086
We mean nothing.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.379
We'll stay on top of you...

06:10.462 --> 06:12.131
...and ride you all semester.

06:12.214 --> 06:14.967
Basically, we're saying
we won't blow the job, man.

06:19.221 --> 06:23.350
By the way, can you tell me if there'll be
any international travel, huh?

06:23.434 --> 06:24.435
Huh? Huh?

06:24.518 --> 06:26.604
Seriously, now,
I swear to God,

06:26.687 --> 06:28.606
I'm really uncomfortable now.
It's time you should go.

06:35.779 --> 06:38.240
Not one acceptable candidate.

06:38.324 --> 06:40.159
What is wrong with the youth of today?

06:42.661 --> 06:44.288
The Internet, dude.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.957
Fries their brain cells, man.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.294
It's cool, Colossus.
We'll find somebody.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.338
C-los, get your ass off my shirt.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.595
Yo, you really should have him
neutered, man.

07:00.596 --> 07:01.889
That's up to him.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.725
They are getting bigger, aren't they?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.603
I'll get that.

07:13.025 --> 07:14.276
Looks like we got one more.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.701
What's your name?

07:24.119 --> 07:27.581
I'm Taj Mahal Badalandabad.

07:27.665 --> 07:29.458
Where are you from, Taj?

07:30.584 --> 07:33.295
I'm an exchange student
from Banglapur, India.

07:33.379 --> 07:36.006
Welcome. What can we do for you?

07:37.508 --> 07:40.511
My exchange program culminates
at the end of this school year,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.347
at which time I must return
to my home country

07:43.430 --> 07:46.141
where I do not have many friends.

07:46.225 --> 07:49.103
I would like very much to spend
my remaining days here,

07:49.186 --> 07:50.854
- serving as your assistant.
- Okay.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.439
We're just gonna do
a little word association.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.358
Say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.442
- Milk.
- Tit.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.362
Oh, Mommy.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.531
Most Indians would say "cow"
because they are sacred,

08:00.614 --> 08:03.659
but I hear "milk," I...
I think giant jugs.

08:03.742 --> 08:06.704
You see, I cannot go home a virgin.

08:06.787 --> 08:10.624
I came here to study the great American
art of muff diving.

08:10.708 --> 08:13.794
To smack clam, munch rug,

08:13.877 --> 08:16.672
dine at just one American pink taco stand.

08:16.755 --> 08:19.883
You know, I wanted to, how is it,
park the porpoise.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.886
You know, I want to take it
through the car wash, baby.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.390
You know, and get it waxed.
I want to wax it. Wax it.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.684
You know, and air dry.

08:28.767 --> 08:32.145
You know, air dry that shit,
yeah. Yeah, air...

08:32.229 --> 08:36.650
And I would like to be your assistant
very much, Mr. Van Wilder.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.653
You'll need a copy of my class schedule
so you can take notes.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.238
You'll also handle my finances.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.240
I lecture at the freshman crisis group
every other Monday.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.075
I'm spearheading the Save the Swim Team
Speedo Spectacular,

08:45.159 --> 08:47.578
and the Bloated Belly Beer Bash
to Battle Bulimia this semester.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.246
This is Sick Boy's room.
Not a week's gone by

08:49.329 --> 08:50.789
he hasn't come down
with some sort of ailment.

08:50.873 --> 08:53.292
Shingles, hepatitis, crabs.
That was his fault.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.461
- Matzo ball soup. Jewish penicillin.
- Thanks, Van.

08:55.544 --> 08:57.546
Don't pick at it. Moving on.

08:57.629 --> 09:00.591
You'll need to move my 7:15
to 8:15, my 8:15 to 9:45,

09:00.674 --> 09:02.760
and my 9:45 to Wednesday.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.595
You owe $75,000
for the speed boat.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.513
Cancel my guest lecture at the Wharton
School next week.

09:06.597 --> 09:09.349
I feel like going somewhere tropical.
Tahiti. Are you writing this down?

09:09.433 --> 09:10.601
Yes, sir.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.394
You owe $200,000 for the thoroughbred.

09:12.478 --> 09:15.397
Oh, and schedule a massage after my golf
game tomorrow afternoon.

09:15.481 --> 09:17.441
- With a happy ending?
- Uh, yes.

09:17.524 --> 09:21.695
And another $39,000 for your son's tuition
and housing this semester.

09:21.779 --> 09:24.490
Tuition?
Van is still in school?

09:24.573 --> 09:26.366
For the better part of a decade.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.582
"Depression:
ls Prozac really the answer?"

09:33.665 --> 09:35.834
"Famine. Crisis in Rwanda."

09:35.918 --> 09:37.753
"Tracking Tuition:
Where does our money really go?"

09:37.836 --> 09:41.548
Each article well-written and extensively
researched by our own Gwen Pearson,

09:41.632 --> 09:45.928
and each article skipped over by the
majority of the student body.

09:46.011 --> 09:49.098
I don't care. I won't pander to them.

09:52.976 --> 09:55.729
"Lite Beer vs. Dark. The Showdown"
by Darius Grayson.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.773
Is that the same...

09:57.856 --> 09:59.775
Pulitzer-prize
winning Darius Grayson.

09:59.858 --> 10:01.360
He's an alumnus of our journalism staff.

10:01.443 --> 10:05.280
He wrote his best stuff in detox.
Still does, I'm told.

10:05.364 --> 10:08.659
I have got a very challenging
assignment for you.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.661
A story that nobody's been able to get.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.037
- About what?
- No, no, no.

10:12.121 --> 10:13.622
It's about whom.

10:31.014 --> 10:32.474
It does not look good.

10:32.558 --> 10:34.393
<i>That's the end of the first half</i>

10:34.476 --> 10:37.437
<i>and the Chickadees will need
a miracle to come back and score.</i>

10:47.823 --> 10:50.159
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step
away from Van's vehicle.

10:50.242 --> 10:51.410
Wilder!

10:51.493 --> 10:53.871
He's got no business parking there.
That's my spot.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.583
They need me, Ted.

11:00.586 --> 11:04.381
This is the first time in my life
I'm glad I'm deaf.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.968
I can't hear the boos. Now, listen up.

11:08.051 --> 11:10.804
I'm only gonna go over this one more time.

11:10.888 --> 11:13.849
In the event they switch
to a zone defense,

11:13.932 --> 11:17.603
we must swing the ball
around the perimeter.

11:17.686 --> 11:20.772
This ball club is the heart
of this institution.

11:20.856 --> 11:23.817
You win, it beats. You lose, it breaks.

11:23.901 --> 11:26.528
You're not boxing out, Big Papa!
You're my Windex man.

11:26.612 --> 11:27.779
I want you shining glass.

11:27.863 --> 11:29.239
Quentin, we gotta D Up out there.

11:29.323 --> 11:33.035
Darius. I want you all over that ball like
a fat kid on a cupcake.

11:33.118 --> 11:35.662
What are you looking at, Suzy? Your mom
called, said you left your legs at home.

11:35.746 --> 11:37.998
For God's sake!

11:38.081 --> 11:41.001
I'd do anything for you guys,

11:41.084 --> 11:43.170
which is why I'm throwing you a little
soiree tomorrow night

11:43.253 --> 11:45.422
but not without a W tonight.
You want to know why?

11:45.505 --> 11:48.050
'Cause nobody wants
to celebrate a loss, guys.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.719
Hey, man, you gonna invite those freak
honeys from Mount Holyoke?

11:50.802 --> 11:52.971
I already did.

11:53.055 --> 11:55.641
They said they'd try to make it
if they weren't humping the Matadors.

11:55.724 --> 11:57.601
The Matadors?

11:57.684 --> 11:59.102
What?

12:00.812 --> 12:02.606
Come on, fellas. We got
a ball game to win.

12:06.443 --> 12:08.946
Let's go kick some Matador tail...

12:32.177 --> 12:36.598
How bad do you wanna be a Delta?

12:36.682 --> 12:39.142
Would you walk on broken glass?

12:40.143 --> 12:42.271
Let the shards tear
into your Achilles tendon,

12:42.354 --> 12:44.147
causing acute achondroplasia

12:44.231 --> 12:48.568
which could lead to non-congenital
dwarfism as you got older?

12:48.652 --> 12:51.863
Just ease up on the medical terms.
Just keep it simple and terrifying.

12:51.947 --> 12:53.782
Gordon, there are very few things
more terrifying

12:53.865 --> 12:56.326
than non-congenital dwarfism, okay?

12:56.410 --> 12:59.705
Hey, Richard. Ready to study?

12:59.788 --> 13:02.958
Gwenny, I said 9:30. It's 9:20.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.460
I'm in the middle
of an 80-year tradition here.

13:08.046 --> 13:10.841
I will be up when I'm done with my
presidential responsibilities.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.218
- All right?
- Okay, I'll wait for you upstairs.

13:14.344 --> 13:17.264
Who's my alabaster princess? Mm?

13:18.390 --> 13:21.727
You are. You are.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.603
You...

13:23.687 --> 13:26.231
Relax, guys. They're just Doritos.

13:27.357 --> 13:29.401
Listen to me, you little fuck stains!

13:29.484 --> 13:31.611
When I count to three, you will jump

13:31.695 --> 13:33.405
or else be banished
from this house forever!

13:33.488 --> 13:35.991
One, two...

13:40.704 --> 13:42.122
Fuck!

14:04.394 --> 14:07.564
Excuse me.
Where can I find Van Wilder?

14:07.647 --> 14:10.484
In <i>the Guinness Book
of World-fucking-Records, man,</i>

14:10.567 --> 14:13.111
under "Raddest fucking dude alive."

14:13.195 --> 14:14.946
Okay. Thanks.

14:15.030 --> 14:17.783
In any one
of these three rooms, Gramps.

14:23.580 --> 14:24.831
Van Wilder.

14:24.915 --> 14:26.249
Van?

14:30.379 --> 14:33.256
Sweet Joseph, my son's a fairy.

14:34.424 --> 14:37.052
Dad, what are you doing here?

14:37.135 --> 14:39.137
Oh, thank God.

14:39.221 --> 14:40.472
No jammies.

14:40.555 --> 14:41.723
- Party foul.
- No, no, hey...

14:41.807 --> 14:43.517
Don't... Oh, dear God.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.685
Next time you'll know better.

14:52.067 --> 14:55.362
Seven years, and no degree. You should
have graduated twice by now.

14:55.445 --> 14:56.696
I've done a lot in seven years.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.824
If you don't have your doctorate,
you haven't done enough.

14:58.907 --> 15:01.952
But you have wasted enough of your time
and my money.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.871
So pack up your panties, son,
because we are heading home.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.040
No.

15:09.793 --> 15:11.920
I'm staying here with my friends.

15:12.003 --> 15:15.799
Fine. Maybe your friends
can pay your tuition,

15:15.882 --> 15:19.594
because this morning I placed a stop
payment on this semester's check.

15:19.678 --> 15:20.846
I'm sorry, son.

15:20.929 --> 15:23.974
Sometimes in life you have to realize
a poor investment

15:24.057 --> 15:26.059
and simply cut your losses.

15:27.978 --> 15:30.230
Write that down.

15:42.784 --> 15:44.453
I need more time.

15:44.536 --> 15:46.580
There's got to be something
that we can work out.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.584
What is that intoxicating scent you're
wearing, Doris?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.335
I have cats.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.588
Meow.

15:58.550 --> 16:04.431
Maybe you could put me on some sort
of, uh, extension program?

16:04.514 --> 16:06.308
A little, uh, pay-as-you-go?

16:06.391 --> 16:08.310
Mr. Wilder, are you
trying to seduce me?

16:08.393 --> 16:12.230
Who, me? No.

16:14.983 --> 16:18.361
Hey, hey!

16:19.362 --> 16:21.990
You know, may-may-maybe
this isn't such a good idea.

16:22.073 --> 16:24.910
Being bad seldom is.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.130
Oh, yeah. That's the shit.

16:37.214 --> 16:41.801
Hey. Guess what. I'm feeling a little
cold sore coming on.

16:41.885 --> 16:44.888
Maybe we shouldn't do this
for three to six weeks.

16:44.971 --> 16:49.226
Shut up, bitch,
and give me some sugar.

17:00.028 --> 17:03.782
Fill this out. It's a standard payment
plan extension form.

17:04.907 --> 17:08.954
You mean, we didn't have to...

17:09.037 --> 17:11.289
But aren't you glad we did?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.680
You can either mail this in
or drop it off.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.013
<i>Go, baby, 90!</i>

17:29.516 --> 17:30.850
Mail it in!

17:31.851 --> 17:34.646
Mail it in! Mail it in.

17:34.729 --> 17:38.024
Van, you must make four monthly
payments of $5,000 each.

17:38.108 --> 17:40.110
I'm sorry, Taj. I'm gonna have
to let you go.

17:40.193 --> 17:44.239
I... I don't have the resources
to pay for your services anymore.

17:44.322 --> 17:46.408
A good soldier does not leave
his commander

17:46.491 --> 17:49.327
just because he lies wounded,
arms torn off at the sockets,

17:49.411 --> 17:52.414
intestines spilling out onto the mud,
picked at by the birds.

17:52.497 --> 17:54.499
I will stay on at no charge.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.209
Okay.

17:56.293 --> 17:57.836
Exactly how much money do you have'?

17:57.919 --> 17:59.796
He has only $34.

17:59.879 --> 18:04.175
Damn, Van! What the hell
you gonna do with $34, man?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.790
Whoo!

18:35.874 --> 18:39.753
Congratulations, Taj.
Your first blow job.

18:39.836 --> 18:42.964
In my country, a woman's mastery
of her gastronomical releases

18:43.048 --> 18:44.924
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

18:45.008 --> 18:47.969
Well, Desiree is the foremost connoisseur
of chili con carne

18:48.053 --> 18:49.262
and a TA at Coolidge.

18:49.346 --> 18:51.222
I wish I had teachers like that.

18:51.306 --> 18:55.894
<i>And just like that,
Topless Tutors was born.</i>

18:56.102 --> 18:57.896
X

18:57.979 --> 19:01.524
equals... six?

19:04.194 --> 19:05.862
We knew you could do it.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.697
<i>Desi told me how she and a few
of her grad school pals</i>

19:07.781 --> 19:09.949
<i>could use some extra income.</i>

19:10.033 --> 19:12.452
<i>Taj proved to be an excellent
company accountant,</i>

19:12.535 --> 19:14.621
<i>as well as our most valued client.</i>

19:25.382 --> 19:27.050
Excuse me.

19:28.176 --> 19:32.514
Hi. I'm looking for information
on a current student here, Van Wilder.

19:38.687 --> 19:40.897
Freshman year.
I'll get the others.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.732
Wait, wait. There are more of these?

19:42.816 --> 19:44.609
Actually, there are many more.

19:44.693 --> 19:47.904
It seems Mr. Wilder
didn't quite come out of his shell

19:47.987 --> 19:50.115
until mid-sophomore year.

19:50.198 --> 19:52.367
Thanks.

19:56.371 --> 19:58.581
It's like this itchy,
rashy burning sensation.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.083
And it hurts when I...

20:02.961 --> 20:04.087
Dance?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.131
When I pee!

20:06.214 --> 20:08.049
- You hooked up with a burner, didn't you?
- Yeah.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.260
She seemed like a nice girl,
said it was her first time?

20:10.343 --> 20:12.303
You know, you should always check
the quality of the turf

20:12.387 --> 20:13.555
before you step onto the field.

20:13.638 --> 20:16.474
Listen, go to the campus hospital,
see Stu.

20:16.558 --> 20:18.727
Tell him Van sent you,
and remember...

20:18.810 --> 20:20.395
Don't be a fool. Wrap your tool.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.105
Thanks, Van. Thanks a lot.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.815
Don't thank me.
Thank penicillin.

20:25.775 --> 20:29.070
Crazy kids with their crazy VD.

20:30.864 --> 20:31.990
You must be Van.

20:32.073 --> 20:33.241
Hi.

20:33.324 --> 20:36.703
I'm Gwen Pearson,
staff writer for The Liberator.

20:36.786 --> 20:39.414
Hey. Oh!

20:39.497 --> 20:42.792
Okay, look, that old bag is stronger
than she looks, all right?

20:42.876 --> 20:45.837
I'm doing a human interest piece on you.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.923
Well, I'm flattered. I'd love
for your piece to be on me.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.969
But sadly I don't do interviews.
I never have, I never will.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.053
I do lunch, though.

20:54.137 --> 20:56.347
My editor did say
this would be a challenge.

20:56.431 --> 20:58.475
- Van, second date with Emily. Red? Blue?
- Blue.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.436
Blue. Brings out your eyes. Kid's got
killer eyes, not unlike yourself.

21:01.519 --> 21:02.520
Has anyone ever told you that before?

21:02.604 --> 21:04.481
- Yes, my boyfriend.
- Oh.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.524
Is it true that this is your seventh year
at Coolidge?

21:06.608 --> 21:09.027
Carry the two...Yes, that's correct.

21:09.110 --> 21:11.154
So what's your boyfriend's name?
Does he go to school here?

21:11.237 --> 21:12.238
Does he appreciate you?

21:12.322 --> 21:14.324
- That's none of your business.
- You know what?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.700
You're right.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.080
His name's Richard. He's premed.

21:21.164 --> 21:23.124
Van, you have a 1:30
with the swim team.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.542
On it.

21:24.626 --> 21:26.544
- You have an assistant?
- Yes, I do.

21:29.047 --> 21:31.549
Is there anything you can tell me
about yourself

21:31.633 --> 21:33.384
that I haven't already found out
from your public records?

21:33.468 --> 21:35.637
Uh-huh. I'll be at the quad tomorrow night
at 10:00. Sound good?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.347
- Yes.
- It's a date.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.641
It's an interview, not a date.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.938
Gwen, first dates are interviews.

21:47.190 --> 21:49.150
- You going out tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

21:49.234 --> 21:52.529
Rob's coming over. I'm closing in
on that diamond, Gwen.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.698
The dynamic duo
will seal the deal tonight.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.158
Good luck, ladies.

22:00.203 --> 22:03.790
Somebody got awfully dressed up
to quiz me on my first Anatomy midterm.

22:03.873 --> 22:06.501
I'm so sorry, baby, I totally forgot.

22:06.584 --> 22:09.003
- I have an interview for the paper.
- At 10:00 at night?

22:09.087 --> 22:12.382
Can't you postpone it?
Gwen, first exam, most crucial.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.425
<i>It's not like you're on</i> a <i>deadline
for The Boston Globe.</i>

22:16.261 --> 22:17.720
It's the only time he had available.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.347
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, okay? Bye.

22:21.975 --> 22:23.142
He?

22:28.523 --> 22:31.317
All right. Hey, Gwen, all right!
You're just in time.

22:31.401 --> 22:33.695
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm not taking off my clothes.

22:33.778 --> 22:38.157
Oh, well, it is the Naked Mile Run.
Everybody else is in their birthday suit.

22:40.034 --> 22:41.077
Except that guy.

22:42.453 --> 22:45.707
- Um, I have a few questions for you.
- In time. This is gonna be fun.

22:45.790 --> 22:48.001
You know, that three-letter word,
starts with F?

22:48.084 --> 22:51.170
So you're quite the campus man,
heading events like the Jéger Olympics.

22:51.254 --> 22:53.923
Oh, yes, well, you know,
you haven't lived

22:54.007 --> 22:56.968
until you've shot putted
blitzed on Jéger. Heinie?

22:57.051 --> 22:59.888
This was a really bad idea.
I'm leaving.

22:59.971 --> 23:02.932
Hey! Are we gonna
reschedule or what?

23:13.151 --> 23:15.028
Who's a big boy?

23:15.111 --> 23:16.404
Who's a big--

23:16.487 --> 23:18.489
Oh, God!

23:18.573 --> 23:21.034
Those things could
raise the Titanic.

23:22.744 --> 23:24.037
You Van Wilder?

23:24.120 --> 23:26.539
<i>The strip club owner got tired
of using his B squad,</i>

23:26.623 --> 23:28.207
<i>so he came back for the starting lineup.</i>

23:29.500 --> 23:31.419
<i>Topless Tutors was dead.</i>

23:33.046 --> 23:35.423
We are truly up the Ganga river
without a bamboo oar.

23:35.506 --> 23:38.343
We're still $1,200 short
of your next tuition payment.

23:38.426 --> 23:42.388
Taj, I learned a long time ago that
worrying is like a rocking chair.

23:42.472 --> 23:44.682
It gives you something to do, but it
doesn't get you anywhere.

23:44.766 --> 23:46.351
Write that down.

23:46.434 --> 23:48.728
Don't even sweat it, Taj.
I think I've got a plan.

23:50.146 --> 23:51.898
- Let's go get fucked up.
- Sounds good.

23:51.981 --> 23:53.483
Is that all you people think about?

23:53.566 --> 23:55.360
Now, I admit I applied for this job

23:55.443 --> 23:58.029
because I wanted to cut loose
and shake my rump,

23:58.112 --> 24:01.032
but I do not believe that this dilemma
will be solved by partying.

24:05.203 --> 24:06.621
Can I help you, son?

24:06.704 --> 24:11.376
I certainly hope so, Mr. Wilder.
I come to you in desperation.

24:11.459 --> 24:15.588
I'm Panos Patakos, president
of the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity.

24:15.672 --> 24:19.258
I'm sure you're aware of our... stigma.

24:19.342 --> 24:22.261
Yeah, you guys have had
best GPA the last 50 years.

24:22.345 --> 24:27.600
Indeed, but believe it or not,
the best GPA doesn't get you laid.

24:27.684 --> 24:30.520
- Damn well should.
- Amen.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.815
This month marks our 75th anniversary.

24:33.898 --> 24:37.443
I am here to ask you to aid us
in throwing a party,

24:37.527 --> 24:39.070
a party we can be proud of,

24:39.153 --> 24:42.490
a party people will actually show up to.

24:42.573 --> 24:44.242
Gosh, Panos, I'd really love
to help you out,

24:44.325 --> 24:46.244
but I have a bamboo oar
stuck up my Ganges.

24:46.327 --> 24:49.330
It's very scary stuff.
And I just don't have the time.

24:50.748 --> 24:52.458
How much is your time worth?

24:55.294 --> 24:59.340
<i>Panes reminded me that I had
one very valuable skill I'd yet to tap:</i>

24:59.424 --> 25:03.011
<i>My undeniable ability
to throw one hell of a party.</i>

25:08.307 --> 25:11.227
<i>I was hanging on by a thread,
but I was still making tuition.</i>

25:14.731 --> 25:17.191
The strawberry! Eat the strawberry!
It's worth 250!

25:17.275 --> 25:19.986
Don't you think I know that?

25:20.069 --> 25:22.196
- You treat me like a child.
- I don't like the way you condescend me.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.532
- Don't do that!
- Frankly, you're juvenile.

25:24.615 --> 25:26.492
Guys.

25:26.576 --> 25:28.202
I know Ms. Pac-Man's special.

25:28.286 --> 25:31.456
She's fun. She's cute. She swallows.

25:31.539 --> 25:33.666
But we gotta talk, guys.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.711
Huddle up.
Come on. Team meeting here.

25:36.794 --> 25:38.796
Cowboy. All right.

25:39.797 --> 25:41.549
I look at you guys,
and you know what I see?

25:41.632 --> 25:44.218
A collective GPA of 52,000?

25:44.302 --> 25:45.636
Yeah! No!

25:45.720 --> 25:49.474
I see a bunch of party animals
crouched in attack position,

25:49.557 --> 25:51.559
ready to strike. Am I right?

25:52.602 --> 25:54.479
No one even knows we're here.

25:54.562 --> 25:58.232
<i>Au contraire, mon frére. Girls!</i>

25:58.316 --> 25:59.734
Hi.

25:59.817 --> 26:02.236
I'd like you to meet Sherri and Terri.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.864
Two girls utterly infatuated

26:04.947 --> 26:09.869
with men who have larger than normal
medulla oblongatas.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.751
Pearson.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.044
I got a hot news tip for you.

26:18.127 --> 26:19.545
It's Friday night.
Get the hell out of here.

26:19.629 --> 26:22.965
I know. I'm just doing some final
revisions to this piece on euthanasia.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.468
Oh, I read that. Made me want
to kill myself.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.804
I'm kidding.
Where's my Wilder story?

26:27.887 --> 26:29.013
There is no story, Elliot.

26:29.097 --> 26:32.517
The guy's a joke. I mean, he tries to turn
every interview into a date.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.519
A good writer gets her story
no matter what.

26:34.602 --> 26:37.939
Now please get me the Wilder piece.

26:38.022 --> 26:41.025
He's throwing a big party tonight.
You should be there.

26:48.866 --> 26:51.244
- Hey.
- This is really a pimping good time.

26:51.327 --> 26:52.370
Yes, it is.

26:53.371 --> 26:54.747
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!

26:54.831 --> 26:58.584
Look who's checking out
the Badalandabad. Her name's Naomi.

26:58.668 --> 27:01.087
That's "I moan" backwards.

27:02.839 --> 27:04.382
I put in a good word for you.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.553
Hey, Tajy. Let's boogie.

27:29.031 --> 27:31.200
These are the most pathetic
bunch of pledges.

27:31.284 --> 27:32.910
- You picked 'em.
- What?

27:34.996 --> 27:36.581
- Hey, babe.
- Gwen.

27:36.664 --> 27:38.124
Why aren't you in costume?

27:38.207 --> 27:39.625
I can't stay.
I have to work tonight.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.419
But you're gonna miss
the biggest party of the year.

27:42.962 --> 27:46.048
Well, um, I gotta go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.633
What?

27:47.717 --> 27:49.760
This party so rocks, Richard.

27:49.844 --> 27:52.889
- This party sucks rectum, Jeannie.
- Okay.

27:55.433 --> 27:56.601
Where the hell is everyone?

27:56.684 --> 27:59.770
Mad props for this pimping good time

27:59.854 --> 28:01.898
go out to those hung
and handsome bad boys

28:01.981 --> 28:04.942
of Lambda Omega Omega.

28:05.026 --> 28:07.528
Thanks for the good time, fellas.

28:17.705 --> 28:19.123
Gwen! Hey!

28:19.207 --> 28:21.375
- Let's get you some skates.
- I'm not here to skate.

28:21.459 --> 28:23.628
Look, for some reason,
my editor thinks you're a story.

28:23.711 --> 28:25.296
Well, what do you think?

28:25.379 --> 28:29.634
As a story, I think...
You're a little soft.

28:29.717 --> 28:33.638
Uh, wow, all this time I thought I was
more to you than just some flaccid story.

28:34.722 --> 28:36.515
A dilemma has arose up front.

28:36.599 --> 28:37.892
I don't really know
if we got our point across.

28:37.975 --> 28:39.435
- Crystal clear, guys.
- This is incredible.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.979
100%. Don't go anywhere, okay?

28:43.731 --> 28:44.732
Seriously, Van is a Godsend.

28:44.815 --> 28:47.443
I would have paid him
way more than a grand for this party.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.695
I would have cashed in my Israel bonds.

28:49.779 --> 28:52.865
- How do you put a price on dignity?
- How do you put a price on poonani?

28:52.949 --> 28:53.950
- Yes!
- Oh, God!

28:56.410 --> 28:58.204
Oh, my God. Feel it!

29:03.542 --> 29:05.336
Whoa. Trick or treat.
What's going on?

29:05.419 --> 29:09.131
This vaginal discharge won't let us
partake in the party.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.549
Graphic.

29:10.633 --> 29:12.635
I'm sure that we can accommodate
a few more, yeah?

29:12.718 --> 29:16.347
No can do.
We're at maximum capacity.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.852
- Gwen, what are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

29:21.936 --> 29:23.187
That's my girlfriend, gluteus erecti.

29:23.271 --> 29:26.399
- You must be premed Dick.
- Yeah, that's right.

29:26.482 --> 29:28.067
What's it to you?

29:28.150 --> 29:29.735
Thanks for the story.

29:29.819 --> 29:30.903
What story?

29:30.987 --> 29:32.947
Brilliant, Pearson.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.283
I have been inundated
with people telling me

29:35.366 --> 29:37.034
how much they enjoy reading
about this guy.

29:37.118 --> 29:40.371
They want more, and so do I.
I want you to do a follow-up.

29:40.454 --> 29:42.832
I did your story, Elliot.
I'm not doing another one.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.208
Even if I tell you it's gonna be
on the front page

29:44.292 --> 29:46.544
of the graduation issue
in two months?

29:48.838 --> 29:51.924
And I quote,
"Van Wilder is a party pimp."

29:52.008 --> 29:54.635
Sick Boy!
Can you believe she wrote that?

29:54.719 --> 29:55.970
Van Wilder's phone.

29:56.053 --> 29:58.180
I do not foresee that to be a problem.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.516
And that guy she's with...
All kinds of wrong for her.

30:00.599 --> 30:04.353
- Sick Boy, how are you doing?
- Van, the shingles are all gone.

30:05.521 --> 30:06.772
That ointment really worked.

30:06.856 --> 30:08.274
Thanks.

30:08.357 --> 30:10.067
Looking good there, buddy.

30:15.698 --> 30:17.033
He'll call you back.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.576
Unbelievable.

30:18.659 --> 30:20.911
Van Wilder's phone.

30:20.995 --> 30:22.663
- Terrible.
- I think so.

30:22.747 --> 30:24.373
Uh, yeah.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.208
- Hang on.
- Unbelievable.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.836
Van's room.
Saturday night, yeah.

30:28.919 --> 30:30.880
That's... How did you...
From the paper?

30:30.963 --> 30:34.133
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thanks.

30:34.216 --> 30:37.303
- Yeah. No problem, confirming. Bye.
- This writing, it's just...

30:37.386 --> 30:38.471
- Hi, I was just wondering...
- No!

30:39.597 --> 30:40.890
...if you could slam the door in my face.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.642
Van, Van, you must listen to me. Because
of her article,

30:43.726 --> 30:46.562
practically everybody wants
to have a party thrown by Van Wilder,

30:46.645 --> 30:48.314
the party liaison.

30:48.397 --> 30:49.815
Your cash camel has arrived.

30:55.237 --> 30:56.489
We need to talk.

30:59.367 --> 31:01.786
This is why I don't do interviews.
You totally slammed me.

31:01.869 --> 31:04.413
You journalists
and your irresponsible reporting.

31:04.497 --> 31:07.500
I recorded quotes that you received money
from the Lambdas to throw them a party.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.419
Recorded? What are you, bugged?
Do I need to frisk you?

31:10.503 --> 31:12.338
Why is my story such a big deal to you?

31:12.421 --> 31:15.257
Because I didn't want students to know
that <i>I</i> threw the party.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.886
Yeah, they paid me, but that's not
the only reason I did it.

31:18.969 --> 31:21.972
Those Lambdas are cool in their own right.
People just needed to realize it.

31:22.056 --> 31:25.518
I'm sorry. I didn't know, you know,
you had a benevolent agenda.

31:25.601 --> 31:27.937
There's two sides to every story, Gwen.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.481
Look, I have a chance to make front page
of the graduation issue,

31:30.564 --> 31:32.817
which is a huge deal to me. Please.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.694
- Let me get the other side.
- All right.

31:35.778 --> 31:37.655
There's this function
I'm hosting tomorrow night.

31:37.738 --> 31:40.783
If you want, you could tag along.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.119
- I'll be there.
- It's a date.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.663
It's an interview.

31:45.746 --> 31:47.915
Remember, today's assignment
is about shadow.

31:47.998 --> 31:50.167
So don't get too hung up on detail.

31:50.251 --> 31:52.378
All right, everybody?

31:52.461 --> 31:55.423
Oh, Lord.

31:56.424 --> 31:59.468
So much sinew,
I need a bigger pencil.

31:59.552 --> 32:02.680
8:30 p.m. Yeah, that's fine.
Hello, hello? Yeah...

32:02.763 --> 32:04.056
<i>Word spread around campus.</i>

32:04.140 --> 32:07.143
<i>My calendar was filled
with parties to plan.</i>

32:07.226 --> 32:10.646
<i>Van Wilder,
party liaison, was born.</i>

32:11.981 --> 32:14.733
<i>At the Hillel House,
I broke bread.</i>

32:14.817 --> 32:16.569
<i>And then I broke the boredom.</i>

32:21.323 --> 32:22.867
<i>They said I did them</i> a mitzvah.

32:22.950 --> 32:24.410
<i>That's Yiddish for "good deed."</i>

32:24.493 --> 32:26.912
<i>Write that down.</i>

32:26.996 --> 32:29.498
<i>Oh, yeah, she came, too.</i>

32:34.003 --> 32:35.963
This is the second party of his
she's gone to.

32:36.046 --> 32:37.590
Sounds serious. Threatened?

32:39.008 --> 32:41.635
Threatened? Please.

32:43.596 --> 32:46.891
I'm president of both my fraternity
and the student government.

32:46.974 --> 32:50.352
He's nothing more
than a mild rectal itch.

32:51.979 --> 32:53.647
You know what you do
about a mild rectal itch, Gordo?

32:53.731 --> 32:55.858
- What's that, Richard?
- You scratch it.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.902
And then you scratch it some more.

32:57.985 --> 33:01.447
The more you scratch at it, the worse it
gets until finally you have nothing left

33:01.530 --> 33:06.535
but a raw, chafed,
possibly infected anal cavity.

33:06.619 --> 33:08.412
And then it's won.

33:09.538 --> 33:12.500
When all you had to do from the start
was take a medicated pad...

33:14.835 --> 33:16.128
and smother it.

33:21.175 --> 33:23.636
All right, people,
midterm is next week.

33:25.346 --> 33:27.097
Here you have your five categories.

33:27.181 --> 33:30.309
Commerce and trade,
so forth and so on.

33:30.392 --> 33:32.061
What you doing?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.730
I'm in the middle of class.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.440
You know, that five-letter word.

33:36.524 --> 33:40.152
I thought we could spend some time
together for the story.

33:41.529 --> 33:42.821
H9)'-

33:42.905 --> 33:45.032
I want you to have this.

33:46.575 --> 33:49.036
- Yeah.
- And thank you.

33:49.119 --> 33:50.371
All right, things to remember.

33:50.454 --> 33:52.498
Commerce and trade...

33:52.581 --> 33:55.417
Everybody just file out
in an orderly fashion.

34:04.426 --> 34:07.179
What? Wha-- Oh, come on. Hop in.

34:07.263 --> 34:08.722
I am not getting in that thing with you.

34:08.806 --> 34:11.016
If you want the story,
you'll get in this thing with me.

34:14.061 --> 34:15.728
What happened?
ls everyone okay?

34:20.775 --> 34:21.944
Wilder.

34:24.446 --> 34:26.156
Are we gonna get in trouble
for being in here?

34:26.239 --> 34:27.992
No, no, it's cool.
The equipment manager owes me a favor.

34:28.074 --> 34:29.618
I introduced him to his wife.

34:29.702 --> 34:31.954
Life is all about developing
relationships, Gwen.

34:32.036 --> 34:33.539
I hope you can skate.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.502
So the deal is, I score,

34:38.585 --> 34:41.170
you cooperate
and answer all my questions?

34:41.255 --> 34:43.716
- I miss...
- Dinner for two, me and you.

34:44.717 --> 34:46.302
Clothing optional.

35:01.775 --> 35:03.736
Ow.

35:09.700 --> 35:10.701
Come on!

35:18.042 --> 35:19.126
Holy crap.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.064
My brothers play hockey...

35:41.857 --> 35:43.442
...for the Rangers.

35:44.777 --> 35:47.363
My dad just didn't see me
as a sound investment anymore.

35:47.446 --> 35:53.410
But he gave up on me and my morn long
before I ever came here.

35:53.494 --> 35:55.621
Maybe seven years of tuition

35:55.704 --> 35:58.290
is a good way to remind him
that you're still angry.

36:00.042 --> 36:03.796
So how long have you and premed Richard
been together?

36:03.879 --> 36:05.589
Since my freshman year.

36:05.673 --> 36:07.091
I bet he's a tighty whitey guy.

36:07.174 --> 36:10.135
- Excuse me?
- White, elastic band, constrictive.

36:10.219 --> 36:12.471
You can tell a lot about a person
by the kind of drawers they wear.

36:12.554 --> 36:14.181
Like you. Granny panties, I bet.

36:14.264 --> 36:16.809
Does that allude to me
being the plain, boring type?

36:16.892 --> 36:20.312
No, I just wanted a visual.

36:20.396 --> 36:23.649
Well, I think it takes a lot more
than the kind of underwear one wears

36:23.732 --> 36:25.025
to define them as a person.

36:25.109 --> 36:27.403
Like what?

36:27.486 --> 36:29.613
Like their actions.

36:29.697 --> 36:31.532
For instance,

36:31.615 --> 36:34.493
most people want to get out of school
so they can make money.

36:34.576 --> 36:38.997
You're trying to make money
to stay in school. Why?

36:39.081 --> 36:42.835
I like it here.

36:42.918 --> 36:45.337
What about your future?

36:45.421 --> 36:47.297
You take life way too seriously.

36:47.381 --> 36:49.842
Life is serious.

36:49.925 --> 36:52.761
You know, I used to party with this guy
who once told me,

36:52.845 --> 36:55.639
"Van, don't take life too seriously.
You'll never get out alive."

36:58.642 --> 37:00.811
He used to write for the school paper.

37:00.894 --> 37:03.564
He kept babbling about the differences
between light and dark beer.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.861
Very strange, but good advice.

37:08.944 --> 37:10.863
You think about the future too much,

37:10.946 --> 37:13.991
you know, you kinda forget
about the present, obviously.

37:15.242 --> 37:18.620
And I am really enjoying
the present right now,

37:18.704 --> 37:21.540
sharing a penalty box
and a tri-latte with Gwen Pearson,

37:21.623 --> 37:25.544
who believes censorship reflects
society's lack of confidence in itself.

37:25.627 --> 37:27.546
You actually read that article?

37:27.629 --> 37:30.007
Okay, look, I read
the damn article, all right?

37:30.090 --> 37:32.509
But don't tell anyone, because if word
gets out that I read,

37:32.593 --> 37:35.429
my reputation?
Shot to hell.

37:40.142 --> 37:43.771
She's smart, she's beautiful,

37:43.854 --> 37:45.773
she can skate.

37:45.856 --> 37:49.902
She's not for you, dude.
She's too high-strung.

37:49.985 --> 37:51.487
Besides, babes that fine?

37:51.570 --> 37:54.448
They're way into themselves and shit.

37:54.531 --> 37:55.991
Van.

37:57.242 --> 37:58.243
After this weekend,

37:58.327 --> 38:01.288
we should have sufficient funds to cover
your next two payments.

38:01.371 --> 38:03.582
I mean, this girl is dynamite.

38:05.167 --> 38:07.586
Too bad she's dating Strapper John, MD.

38:11.799 --> 38:13.967
Where did you find that?

38:14.051 --> 38:15.677
In your room a few days ago.

38:15.761 --> 38:19.139
I'm trying to spark this bong, but this
damn thing won't light.

38:19.223 --> 38:21.850
That's no bong.
It's for my schlong.

38:27.481 --> 38:29.066
Hold on.

38:29.149 --> 38:31.318
You mean I put my mouth
on your cock pump?

38:33.153 --> 38:34.780
Oh, damn.

38:38.867 --> 38:41.078
I have a date with Naomi tomorrow night,

38:41.161 --> 38:43.288
and I just wanted to bring my A game.

38:44.748 --> 38:48.919
Taj, come on.
That's what I'm here for, all right?

38:49.002 --> 38:51.338
Now, follow my foolproof plan,

38:51.421 --> 38:54.132
and I'm gonna help you put the bang
in Banglapur.

38:54.216 --> 38:57.052
All you need are the three fundamentals:
scented candles,

38:57.135 --> 39:00.639
massage oil,

39:00.722 --> 39:02.266
and Barry White.

39:02.349 --> 39:03.851
Write that down.

39:04.852 --> 39:07.896
- Hey, no cock pump.
- No cock pump.

39:07.980 --> 39:10.274
Barry White.

39:10.357 --> 39:12.818
I'm gonna go wash my hands now.

39:12.901 --> 39:17.281
Oh, Gwen. Your labia feels so good
around my swollen phallus.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.451
Oh, I'm fairly confident
I'm going to ejaculate.

39:21.535 --> 39:24.955
I'm releasing my seminal fluids
inside of you now.

39:38.218 --> 39:39.636
Are you okay?

39:41.889 --> 39:43.891
Yeah. Why?

39:45.309 --> 39:47.561
Well, didn't you...

39:47.644 --> 39:49.438
Well, it's kind of hard in 15 seconds.

39:50.439 --> 39:51.732
Damn it, Gwen.

39:54.276 --> 39:56.486
You know the kind of pressure I'm under
with my exams.

39:58.947 --> 40:00.699
- I'm sorry.
- No, look, I'm sorry.

40:00.782 --> 40:02.367
This semester's marks
could very well determine

40:02.451 --> 40:04.953
the next 10 years of our life together.
Do you realize that?

40:07.623 --> 40:09.249
You know,

40:09.333 --> 40:12.544
you shouldn't take life too seriously.

40:12.628 --> 40:14.963
You'll never get out alive.

40:18.926 --> 40:20.928
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

40:24.431 --> 40:26.934
I'm late for my study group.

40:36.318 --> 40:38.737
She was getting awfully chummy
with the rectal itch.

40:38.820 --> 40:41.365
Son of a bitch. Disappear!

40:41.448 --> 40:42.991
Yes, superior leader, sir.

40:47.162 --> 40:49.373
It's time to excise
that cancerous lump.

40:49.456 --> 40:51.166
Forget him tonight.
Let's crap in the chapter room

40:51.249 --> 40:53.919
and make the pledges clean it up.
It'll be fun.

40:54.002 --> 40:57.047
I wish I could, Gordo.
I got dinner at Gwen's parents' house.

40:58.048 --> 40:59.967
Sounds special.
ls Wilder gonna be there?

41:00.968 --> 41:03.637
Hey, guys. Hey, Richard.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.639
Is there anything
I can do for you today?

41:11.478 --> 41:12.980
Dear Van...

41:18.485 --> 41:20.487
<i>Here you go, Ta}
Get your rave on, man.</i>

41:20.570 --> 41:22.072
Thanks. You got it.

41:22.155 --> 41:25.075
"See you tonight. Gwen. "
The invite to the parents' house.

41:25.158 --> 41:29.121
This is-- this is big.
This is very, very big.

41:29.204 --> 41:31.123
- Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
- Details.

41:31.206 --> 41:33.542
- I'm off. Taj, you're in charge.
- No, no, no.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.794
No, I do not think I'm capable of handling
such a responsibility.

41:35.877 --> 41:39.673
Hey, hey! Listen to me. Do you know
why I chose you as my assistant?

41:39.756 --> 41:42.217
- So you could teach me how to muff dive?
- No.

41:42.300 --> 41:47.764
Well, yeah, but also, because you have
the potential to be great.

42:04.531 --> 42:06.324
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:06.408 --> 42:08.660
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Van...

42:08.744 --> 42:11.288
Van, you made it.

42:11.371 --> 42:14.166
Evelyn, this is one of your daughter's
acquaintances from school.

42:14.249 --> 42:15.917
There's room for one more, isn't there?

42:16.001 --> 42:18.045
By all means. Come in, please.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.510
Definitely be out of the question
unless, of course, they all agreed with us

42:25.594 --> 42:27.804
and we talked it over.

42:30.223 --> 42:31.308
Excuse me, gentlemen.

42:32.392 --> 42:34.978
Excuse me, gentlemen.

42:35.062 --> 42:38.023
Van, this is Dr. Henke, proctologist.

42:38.106 --> 42:42.986
Oh, well, holy crap.
I hope you're not on call tonight, huh?

42:43.070 --> 42:45.238
- Dr. Beeverman, OB-GYN.
- Oh.

42:45.322 --> 42:47.574
Van Wilder. G-L-A-D to meet you.

42:49.201 --> 42:50.869
And of course, Gwen's father.

42:50.952 --> 42:54.581
Oh, you know, I'm gonna go out on a limb
here. Uh, Dr. Pearson?

42:54.664 --> 42:57.125
- Indeed.
-lndeed.Supen

42:57.209 --> 43:01.088
All right. So am I here for a physical?

43:01.171 --> 43:05.383
'Cause I'm gonna need a few cocktails
before I start coughing for you fellas.

43:12.474 --> 43:13.683
What are you doing here?

43:13.767 --> 43:15.393
I don't know.

43:15.477 --> 43:17.270
No, thank you.

43:17.354 --> 43:20.107
Mr. Wilder here is quite the collegian.

43:20.190 --> 43:22.692
He's in his, what, sixth year?

43:22.776 --> 43:24.444
Mm. Lucky number seven, actually.

43:25.529 --> 43:26.863
What are you studying, son?

43:26.947 --> 43:28.365
Well, I dabble in a little bit
of everything.

43:28.448 --> 43:31.368
I've tried to experience all that Coolidge
has to offer.

43:31.451 --> 43:33.537
Well, surely you have
a career in mind.

43:33.620 --> 43:36.206
No, not really.

43:36.289 --> 43:38.375
I'm still looking for that
dare-to-be-great situation.

43:38.458 --> 43:41.837
Maybe you should start looking
for that dare-to-be-employed situation.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.172
The student body
finds Van so intriguing

43:44.256 --> 43:46.550
that my editor has asked me to do
an expose on him

43:46.633 --> 43:48.009
for the school newspaper.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.095
Well, isn't that wonderful?

43:50.178 --> 43:51.555
That will be quite the page-turner.

43:51.638 --> 43:52.889
It'll be a very well written article.

43:52.973 --> 43:55.267
Gwen is an extremely gifted journalist.

43:55.350 --> 43:58.019
Are you and Richard
in the same fraternity?

43:58.103 --> 43:59.437
Oh, no, no, no.

43:59.521 --> 44:03.233
Van isn't exactly Delta Iota Kappa
material.

44:03.316 --> 44:06.653
Richard, you rascal, you never told me
that you were a DIK.

44:08.155 --> 44:09.948
Not that you had to.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.784
I'm gonna go get another bottle
of champagne.

44:12.868 --> 44:15.203
- Richard, will you help me open it?
- Sure.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.919
Wow.

44:23.003 --> 44:25.505
If he's here, who's running Hell?

44:27.716 --> 44:29.092
What are exactly do you think
you're doing out there?

44:29.176 --> 44:30.594
Proving a point.

44:30.677 --> 44:33.763
Your friend doesn't fit in.
He's a virus, and I'm the vaccine.

44:33.847 --> 44:35.307
I can't believe you're doing this.

44:35.390 --> 44:36.766
Pop quiz. True or false.

44:36.850 --> 44:40.353
You and that GDI have been spending
an inordinate amount of time together.

44:40.437 --> 44:42.606
True. Now here's a multiple choice
question for you.

44:42.689 --> 44:43.815
You're A, an asshole,

44:43.899 --> 44:46.610
B, an asshole who isn't staying
at my place tonight, or C, all the above?

44:46.693 --> 44:48.778
What's B again?

44:48.862 --> 44:51.656
Gwenny, I'm kidding. I apologize.

44:51.740 --> 44:54.618
- Gwenny, where are you going?
- To go save Van.

44:54.701 --> 44:58.163
God only knows what my parents and their
stuck up friends are doing to him now.

45:06.338 --> 45:08.006
Oh! Okay! All right!

45:08.089 --> 45:11.134
You're a natural, Dr. P.
Hey, what are you looking at?

45:11.218 --> 45:14.346
- Henke, you're up. Come on.
- Hey, all right. All right.

45:15.722 --> 45:18.141
Easy, sailor.

45:41.790 --> 45:44.709
All right, Wilder, let's dance.

45:44.793 --> 45:46.670
It's a good day to die, McDoogle.

45:48.505 --> 45:50.632
Oh, yes.

46:14.447 --> 46:16.408
Jesus! Criminy!

46:16.491 --> 46:19.327
What happened to you, Wilder?
Don't think I don't remember.

46:19.411 --> 46:21.746
You got an A in my freshman
economics class.

46:21.830 --> 46:23.415
You remember one thing,
young man.

46:23.498 --> 46:26.584
Apathy is the glove
into which evil slips its hand.

46:26.668 --> 46:28.586
I'll write that down.

46:28.670 --> 46:31.423
You do that. You're not
fooling anybody, Wilder!

46:31.506 --> 46:34.175
You're only fooling yourself!

46:42.934 --> 46:44.811
- Why don't you walk?
- I think I'll walk from here.

46:48.857 --> 46:51.776
Are you stalking me'?
Because that would be super.

46:51.860 --> 46:54.779
Well, my mom did want me to invite you
to her Tupperware party next week.

46:54.863 --> 46:57.574
Was that a...

46:57.657 --> 46:59.451
Judges' ruling.

46:59.534 --> 47:02.454
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I do believe that was a joke.

47:08.209 --> 47:11.254
I want to apologize for what Richard did
the other night.

47:11.338 --> 47:14.132
It was a really immature stunt.

47:14.215 --> 47:16.301
Yeah, I know,

47:16.384 --> 47:19.554
but, you know, sometimes guys can do
some pretty childish things, Gwen.

47:23.641 --> 47:24.642
Let us proceed.

48:00.512 --> 48:01.513
Is he ready?

48:02.514 --> 48:04.140
Ah, yeah, he's ready.

48:04.224 --> 48:05.225
It's go time.

48:16.236 --> 48:17.862
Such a good boy.

48:18.905 --> 48:22.450
Stop for a second.
Stop for a second. Stop.

48:22.534 --> 48:24.035
Okay.

48:34.129 --> 48:36.673
For the love of God.

48:36.756 --> 48:38.091
Smile, buddy.

48:44.722 --> 48:46.182
Lovely.

48:46.266 --> 48:49.185
It's all about presentation, gentlemen.

48:57.152 --> 48:59.612
Well, I'll be damned!

48:59.696 --> 49:01.948
Poor guyjust needed a little TLC.

49:08.079 --> 49:10.290
I got it, guys.
No problem whatsoever.

49:13.918 --> 49:16.171
Let the damn baby have his ball back.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.800
Thank you, brothers.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.763
It's not like he can
see out of it anyway.

49:25.847 --> 49:27.140
<i>Loser.</i>

49:33.104 --> 49:34.731
Awesome work, sisters.

49:39.360 --> 49:40.612
Special delivery, Richard.

49:42.113 --> 49:45.283
- Time out.
- What the fuck, Jeannie?

49:45.366 --> 49:48.953
"From the sisters of Sigma Theta Tau."
Well, dig in, guys.

49:53.041 --> 49:54.918
Mmm.

49:55.001 --> 49:58.213
Oh, they're still warm.

50:00.965 --> 50:03.051
- So creamy.
- They're awesome.

50:03.134 --> 50:05.637
Oh!

50:09.307 --> 50:11.476
Oh, they're so creamy.

50:12.685 --> 50:15.146
God, these are excellent.

50:16.231 --> 50:17.357
Um, guys? Richard?

50:17.440 --> 50:18.483
Mmm.

50:21.986 --> 50:23.530
Think I've had these before.

50:23.613 --> 50:25.323
Richard.

50:31.663 --> 50:33.122
Oh, my God!

50:38.169 --> 50:39.796
I love this song.

50:39.879 --> 50:41.589
I know.

50:41.673 --> 50:44.509
It is the White Barry.

50:48.388 --> 50:50.014
Is that for me?

50:50.098 --> 50:51.849
I long to rub you the right way.

50:51.933 --> 50:55.812
You're such a bad little Badalandabad.

51:03.278 --> 51:04.654
No harm, no foul.

51:08.575 --> 51:09.784
Are you all right?

51:09.867 --> 51:12.078
Never better,
my little jasmine flower.

51:31.306 --> 51:32.807
That feels good.

51:38.229 --> 51:41.816
Oh, my God.

51:41.899 --> 51:45.445
On, Taj...

51:45.528 --> 51:46.988
Take me.

51:47.071 --> 51:48.948
I want you now.

51:49.032 --> 51:50.825
Now.

51:50.908 --> 51:52.910
Shit!

51:52.994 --> 51:55.121
Don't tease me.

52:06.257 --> 52:08.468
This is the culmination
of my being.

52:08.551 --> 52:12.096
Baby, I'm about to culminate.
Now, get over here.

52:13.264 --> 52:15.350
Oh, Tajy, I'm so hot.

52:15.433 --> 52:16.893
I feel on fire.

52:16.976 --> 52:18.061
Oh, yeah, me, too, baby.

52:18.144 --> 52:20.897
- Burning up?
- Oh, yeah, baby, I'm burning up.

52:20.980 --> 52:24.067
You are most amazing
to make me feel so...

52:24.150 --> 52:26.069
Damn hot!

52:30.865 --> 52:33.660
I wonder how T-Bad's date's going.

52:33.743 --> 52:37.705
Scented candles,
massage oils, Barry White.

52:37.789 --> 52:41.459
Yeah, we can't be too far
from climax, huh?

52:41.542 --> 52:44.253
Whoa!

53:00.687 --> 53:02.605
Why do I always fail'?

53:02.689 --> 53:04.273
You put too much pressure on yourself.

53:04.357 --> 53:06.567
Don't worry about the money.
I'll figure something out.

53:06.651 --> 53:09.696
More importantly,

53:09.779 --> 53:12.824
when the time is right,

53:12.907 --> 53:14.242
it'll happen.

53:14.325 --> 53:16.035
You'll find the one.

53:31.175 --> 53:34.679
Hi. I need to see the grade transcripts
for Van Wilder, please.

53:34.762 --> 53:36.681
I don't think so.

53:36.764 --> 53:40.101
Student transcripts
are confidential. Sorry.

54:13.676 --> 54:16.179
Swim team really does
need your love, folks.

54:16.262 --> 54:20.308
And if Milty Mingleton can shove himself

54:20.391 --> 54:22.935
into that weenie bikini...

54:27.231 --> 54:30.485
...then you don't need to be shy
about making your donations now!

55:02.683 --> 55:05.520
- Whoo!
- Yes!

55:08.481 --> 55:10.983
Thank you, Milty!

55:13.236 --> 55:15.905
After we put all
the water back in the pool,

55:15.988 --> 55:21.327
we'll be accepting donations in the form
of cash, Visa and full-frontal nudity.

55:21.410 --> 55:22.620
Hutch, take over.

55:25.081 --> 55:27.542
That's right, folks.
Save the swim team.

55:28.751 --> 55:30.044
Hi, Gwen.

55:30.127 --> 55:32.672
Bikini-clad judges for a fundraiser?
That's pretty genius.

55:32.755 --> 55:35.341
Sex sells, Gwen. Sex sells.

55:35.424 --> 55:38.261
Listen, it's not too late for you to enter
the doubles breaststroke if you like.

55:38.344 --> 55:41.013
No, thanks. I forgot my suit.

55:41.097 --> 55:43.516
I just came across a bit of interesting
information, though.

55:43.599 --> 55:44.767
All right, look.

55:44.851 --> 55:48.354
The vet assured me that canine semen
is perfectly healthy.

55:48.437 --> 55:50.022
In fact, surprisingly rich...

55:50.106 --> 55:53.025
You've been 18 units shy of graduating
for the past six semesters.

55:57.113 --> 56:00.992
Whoa. You, uh, went klepto
on my transcripts.

56:01.075 --> 56:03.035
What's going on with you, Van?

56:03.119 --> 56:05.329
You're actively trying
not to get out of here.

56:05.413 --> 56:08.332
Why are you doing this? Huh?

56:08.416 --> 56:09.917
Do you ever stop playing
the in-depth reporter?

56:10.001 --> 56:13.170
L just want to know
why you're putting off your life.

56:13.254 --> 56:15.798
Not for the paper. For me.

56:16.799 --> 56:18.050
Well, I have no comment.

56:20.094 --> 56:21.429
For either of you.

56:55.963 --> 56:59.717
External occipital protuberance.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.970
Posterior gluteal line.

57:05.806 --> 57:07.516
Dorsal appendage.

57:07.600 --> 57:10.061
Gwen. Was the last one right'?

57:10.144 --> 57:11.145
Uh, yeah, that's right.

57:11.228 --> 57:14.732
Wrong! The dorsal appendage exists only
in marine-equipped mammalia.

57:14.815 --> 57:16.442
I knew you weren't listening.

57:16.525 --> 57:18.945
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

57:19.028 --> 57:21.572
Let's get out of here, go grab a beer.

57:21.656 --> 57:25.743
Are you insane? You know
my midterm and finals ritual.

57:25.826 --> 57:28.412
I study till 11 :00.
Nine solid hours of sleep.

57:28.496 --> 57:30.206
Protein shake in the morning.

57:30.289 --> 57:31.749
Okay, very cute.

57:31.832 --> 57:34.085
And also correct.

57:34.168 --> 57:36.754
Which gives us two hours
and 53 minutes of study time.

57:36.837 --> 57:39.882
So, honey, please focus.
All righty?

57:44.387 --> 57:46.472
I have confirmations
from the African-American Club,

57:46.555 --> 57:48.808
the Gay and Lesbian Caucus,
MECCA, HEPA, PETA.

57:48.891 --> 57:51.560
This multi-coalition party
was a masterful plan.

57:51.644 --> 57:54.438
It should triple our income.
I just hope it's enough.

57:54.522 --> 57:56.816
Van, you must listen to me.

57:56.899 --> 58:00.194
We are merely one party away
from accomplishing our goal.

58:00.277 --> 58:01.445
What if she's right, huh?

58:01.529 --> 58:04.448
What if I'm avoiding graduation
because I'm scared?

58:04.532 --> 58:06.158
Listen to yourself, meathead.

58:06.242 --> 58:09.036
You've never doubted yourself
in your whole life.

58:09.120 --> 58:12.415
This girl's got you fiending, man.
It's not good.

58:12.498 --> 58:15.501
- Not good at all.
- Hey, you.

58:15.584 --> 58:18.212
Please move banner a skosh higher, huh?

58:18.295 --> 58:19.672
H9)'-

58:19.755 --> 58:22.341
You got all this. I'm gonna go, uh...

58:22.425 --> 58:24.510
I'm gonna go make some calls
for the party, okay?

58:28.514 --> 58:30.599
- Hi, Van.
- Hi, Donna.

58:30.683 --> 58:32.309
- Hey, Van.
- Ooh, hey, guys.

58:35.479 --> 58:36.939
What are you doing in here?

58:37.023 --> 58:38.941
I had to talk to you.

58:39.025 --> 58:42.820
I thought a lot about what
you said, and, uh...

58:42.903 --> 58:45.364
Well, just... just...

58:45.448 --> 58:47.158
Just take a look at this.

58:47.241 --> 58:49.577
Yeah. Doodles.

58:49.660 --> 58:52.872
I attended class today.
Just about stayed the whole time, too.

58:52.955 --> 58:54.957
I'm glad you went to all your classes
today.

58:55.041 --> 58:56.959
And a few that weren't mine.
Stepped into the wrong one.

58:57.043 --> 58:59.253
Liked what I heard, stayed.

58:59.336 --> 59:01.714
That's great. It really is, Van.

59:01.797 --> 59:05.593
It really is. But don't do it for me.

59:07.094 --> 59:08.387
Do it for you.

59:08.471 --> 59:11.307
Maybe I'm doing it for both of us.

59:12.641 --> 59:16.687
I shouldn't even be talking
to you like this.

59:16.771 --> 59:19.065
And I shouldn't be
in the women's locker room!

59:19.148 --> 59:22.902
But sometimes you gotta let
your heart lead you,

59:22.985 --> 59:26.489
even if you know it's someplace
you know you're not supposed to be.

59:27.740 --> 59:30.659
How often does your heart lead you
into the women's locker room?

59:32.745 --> 59:34.163
This would be a first.

59:34.246 --> 59:36.082
Why do I find that hard to believe?

59:36.165 --> 59:38.000
I'm not saying that I've never been
in here before.

59:38.084 --> 59:40.836
I'm saying it's usually a different part
of my anatomy that does the leading.

59:40.920 --> 59:42.922
Oh, my God.

59:46.592 --> 59:48.010
<i>I just couldn't believe it, Richard.</i>

59:48.094 --> 59:50.096
<i>Gwen and Van in the women's locker room,
staring at each other.</i>

59:50.179 --> 59:51.555
<i>I mean, I just couldn't believe it.</i>

59:51.639 --> 59:53.057
<i>So anyway,
let me tell you something.</i>

01:00:04.777 --> 01:00:08.197
I'm sorry, fellas. The bakery's closed.

01:00:10.616 --> 01:00:13.035
- I'm here to enlist your services.
- Let me guess.

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:15.996
"Come as your favorite drunk-on-jis,
come-gargling frat boy party"?

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.040
Then your mom can come.

01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:21.961
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

01:00:22.044 --> 01:00:24.421
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas

01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:27.550
before settling down
with my fiancee, Gwen.

01:00:28.676 --> 01:00:30.719
Oh, please, you didn't think
she'd be interested

01:00:30.803 --> 01:00:32.513
in a fuckup like you, did you?

01:00:38.227 --> 01:00:43.399
Oh, Van, Van, Van, Van,
Van, Van, Van, Van, Van.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:48.237
That ought to be enough
to get you started.

01:01:06.338 --> 01:01:07.840
- Hello?
- Gwen?

01:01:07.923 --> 01:01:09.758
Casey. I'm just using Gwen's computer.

01:01:09.842 --> 01:01:11.594
Is Gwen there?
I really need to talk to her.

01:01:11.677 --> 01:01:12.887
<i>She's at Richard's,</i>

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.347
getting ready for the engagement dinner
tonight. Message?

01:01:16.348 --> 01:01:17.892
Nope. That's all right.

01:01:25.774 --> 01:01:27.818
Bye. Thanks for coming.

01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:30.362
Lindsey and Rob make
such a great couple, don't you think?

01:01:30.446 --> 01:01:32.531
- Yeah, I'm happy for them.
- Yeah.

01:01:32.615 --> 01:01:35.367
They're gonna make a great married
couple, too. You know why?

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:37.369
Because they love each other?

01:01:37.453 --> 01:01:39.205
Because they're compatible.

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:44.335
It's like a heart transplant patient
finding a donor with the same blood type

01:01:44.418 --> 01:01:47.004
and just the right
chromosomal anomalies.

01:01:47.087 --> 01:01:50.966
A perfect match, connected forever.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.636
Yeah, but that would mean one of them
would have to be dead.

01:01:54.637 --> 01:01:58.015
Gwenny, I'm just saying
that they're a match.

01:01:58.098 --> 01:02:00.601
Just like you and me.

01:02:05.648 --> 01:02:07.316
Lucky girl.

01:02:08.442 --> 01:02:09.985
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Pearson,

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:11.612
I'd be honored if you and I

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:16.909
surgically and spiritually grafted
our lives together.

01:02:16.992 --> 01:02:19.745
Richard, I don't know what to say.

01:02:19.828 --> 01:02:23.832
Just say yes, because I've got even more
amazing news.

01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:26.418
Northwestern called this morning.
They wanna interview me.

01:02:26.502 --> 01:02:27.878
They're gonna send
some recruitment alums to campus

01:02:27.962 --> 01:02:30.381
for written and oral exams.
And then I am in!

01:02:30.464 --> 01:02:31.757
Whoo!

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.093
Oh, man, Northwestern.

01:02:34.176 --> 01:02:37.263
That's great. I'm so
happy for you, Richard.

01:02:37.346 --> 01:02:39.306
Gwenny, be happy for both of us.

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:42.768
The Richard and Gwen life plan
is kicking in.

01:02:42.851 --> 01:02:46.605
Northwestern. I am the shit.

01:02:46.689 --> 01:02:47.773
Oh, and your father wants to get us

01:02:47.856 --> 01:02:50.776
a place over in Forest Grove
as an engagement present.

01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:52.987
- My parents know about this?
- Yeah, I told everyone.

01:02:55.864 --> 01:02:57.992
Where are you going?

01:02:58.075 --> 01:03:00.577
I'm not sure, and for some reason,

01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:02.705
I feel really good about that.

01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:14.258
Hey, Van, can I borrow--

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:18.345
My God, what happened to you?

01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:19.680
I got hit by a big truck.

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:21.557
Are you okay?

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:38.115
Dope song. What's it called?

01:03:38.198 --> 01:03:40.492
"Gwen Used Me For Her Story,
Then Married an Ass Wipe

01:03:40.576 --> 01:03:44.788
and Ran Over My Heart
With a Big Metaphorical Truck."

01:03:44.872 --> 01:03:46.915
Originally performed by Air Supply.

01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:49.084
Who's Air Supply?

01:03:50.085 --> 01:03:51.253
How old are you, Sally?

01:03:53.088 --> 01:03:55.174
I'm old enough to be jealous
of that Gwen girl.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.809
Okay, you can do this.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.492
You must be Gwen, the truck driver.

01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:25.371
Gwen. Hey. Excuse me. Gwen!

01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:29.333
Hey, hold up a second.
What are you doing here?

01:04:29.416 --> 01:04:31.877
What am <i>I</i> doing here?
What were you doing in there?

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.298
As smashed as I am, I'm pretty sure
that's my room, wasn't it?

01:04:36.382 --> 01:04:38.133
What was that girl, a freshman?

01:04:39.134 --> 01:04:40.928
She reads ate sophomore level.

01:04:42.096 --> 01:04:43.847
No, this was a big mistake, Van.
I'm leaving.

01:04:43.931 --> 01:04:47.559
I'm so-- why are you here? Did you come
to hire me to do your bachelorette party?

01:04:47.643 --> 01:04:51.313
'Cause your party pimp has already
been booked by your fiance.

01:04:51.397 --> 01:04:54.024
My fiancé? What are you talking about?

01:04:54.108 --> 01:04:55.317
When are you two tying the knot anyway?

01:04:55.401 --> 01:04:57.694
Because seriously, Gwen, I'd really like
to hold that date open.

01:04:57.778 --> 01:04:59.446
That is none of your business.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.781
And you know what?

01:05:00.864 --> 01:05:02.616
You're none of mine.

01:05:09.123 --> 01:05:10.958
<i>Sounds to me like your rectal itch</i>

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.334
<i>was getting a little
late-night booty scratch.</i>

01:05:12.418 --> 01:05:15.087
First, my bitch
turns down my proposal.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:17.339
Then she runs straight
into that loser's arms.

01:05:17.423 --> 01:05:19.258
Now I don't even know where my bitch is.

01:05:19.341 --> 01:05:20.884
Wilder's got some big blowout
planned for tonight.

01:05:20.968 --> 01:05:22.469
Maybe your bitch
is gonna be there.

01:05:22.553 --> 01:05:25.347
You do not call her that, gonad!

01:05:25.431 --> 01:05:27.766
Hey, guys. Just giving you all the 411.

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.977
I'm a counselor for the Further Leaders
of America's overnighter.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.562
But the bus doesn't leave for a few hours.

01:05:31.645 --> 01:05:33.105
Is there anything I can do
for you before I go?

01:05:33.188 --> 01:05:34.815
Anything at all?

01:05:35.858 --> 01:05:40.237
Okay, listen up. We've got one quick
stop-off before we go.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.781
Tit wad!

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.785
All right, thank you, man.
Enjoy yourself.

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:48.954
All right, sister. Enjoy yourself.
Power to the people.

01:05:49.037 --> 01:05:50.122
How you doing, my man?

01:05:50.205 --> 01:05:52.291
- What's up?
- All right.

01:05:52.374 --> 01:05:56.837
I hate to break this to you, uh, Ming,
but you ain't Asian.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.298
Man, you ever heard
of Tiger Woods, bitch?

01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:02.384
Boy, you better get out of here before I
hit you upside the head with a three iron.

01:06:02.468 --> 01:06:05.512
What's wrong with you?
Enjoy yourself.

01:06:05.596 --> 01:06:06.805
What's wrong, dawg?

01:06:06.889 --> 01:06:08.682
Nothing. I just don't feel
much like partying tonight.

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:11.143
That's a first.

01:06:11.226 --> 01:06:14.438
Hey, Van. I just wanted to come by
and extend an olive branch.

01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:16.398
ID, please.

01:06:16.482 --> 01:06:18.317
Well, it's a terrible picture of me,
but...

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.069
Well, I'll be the judge of... oh!

01:06:21.153 --> 01:06:23.405
There's nothing fake about this ID.

01:06:23.489 --> 01:06:25.991
Did you sit behind me
two semesters ago?

01:06:26.074 --> 01:06:28.494
I think I remember this behind.
I mean, you sitting behind me.

01:06:28.577 --> 01:06:31.663
This whole rivalry thing
has become a tad childish.

01:06:31.747 --> 01:06:36.168
Well, I hope we can put it all
behind us and be friends.

01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:37.711
That's what Gwen wants.

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:42.341
You have absolutely no idea
what Gwen wants.

01:06:42.424 --> 01:06:44.009
Say hi to your gerbil for me.

01:06:51.767 --> 01:06:53.268
Okay, kids.

01:06:53.352 --> 01:06:55.187
This is our Uncle Jéger.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.397
That's right. Drink up.

01:06:58.649 --> 01:07:01.068
This tastes like shit.
Do you have any scotch?

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:05.239
Gotta go. Sorry. Bye.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:07.366
Bye-bye. Call me.

01:07:07.449 --> 01:07:09.034
Gentlemen.

01:07:09.117 --> 01:07:10.702
Trevor.

01:07:10.786 --> 01:07:15.082
We got an anonymous tip that there's
some underage drinking going on here.

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:16.416
Hutch?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.585
Hell, no, man. I've been
at the door all night.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:25.384
Good enough for me. Have fun, guys.

01:07:25.467 --> 01:07:27.970
All right, Trevor. Stay cool.

01:07:28.971 --> 01:07:31.557
I love you, man.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.808
No, man.

01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:34.393
I love you.

01:07:36.812 --> 01:07:40.065
Those circus midgets
cannot hold their booze!

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.781
Don't worry, Van.
We'll get you out, man.

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:03.088
Delta Iota Kappa rules!

01:08:06.925 --> 01:08:09.845
Damn it, Gwen, pick it up.
I know you're there.

01:08:09.928 --> 01:08:12.556
<i>You know I have my Northwestern
interview next week.</i>

01:08:13.807 --> 01:08:19.854
Look, I need you to help me
"release" some pressure.

01:08:19.938 --> 01:08:24.026
<i>You know, help me "relax."</i>

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.194
Just so we're clear, Gwen, I'm talking
about intercourse.

01:08:26.278 --> 01:08:28.071
<i>Look, I know you had
a fling with Wilder.</i>

01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:32.242
And it's okay. You just had to get it out
of your system.

01:08:32.326 --> 01:08:34.911
<i>I just hope you
used some protection.</i>

01:08:34.995 --> 01:08:37.747
<i>And I wouldn't want our future children
to be tainted</i>

01:08:37.831 --> 01:08:40.459
because Mommy went slumming
one night back in college.

01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:41.877
Ugh.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.212
Why don't you go "release"
your own pressure?

01:08:45.296 --> 01:08:47.090
Oh, and just so we're clear,

01:08:47.174 --> 01:08:49.551
I'm telling you to go fuck yourself!

01:08:54.014 --> 01:08:57.475
Hi, partner in crime. ls there anything
I can do for you today?

01:08:58.477 --> 01:09:01.020
Oh, my God!
We make such the fab team!

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:05.359
Last night, I was so like Bonnie,
and you were so like Clyde, and now this?

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:08.612
Would you shut up?
I'm trying to pleasure you.

01:09:08.694 --> 01:09:10.947
Sorry, Richard. Pleasure away.

01:09:12.866 --> 01:09:14.326
P.S., this is an awesome room.

01:09:14.408 --> 01:09:16.243
P.S., shut the fuck up!

01:09:20.874 --> 01:09:23.752
Here, I'm done with all of this.

01:09:23.835 --> 01:09:25.712
The Wilder story's not done.

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:27.130
Why don't you read it
before you criticize?

01:09:27.214 --> 01:09:32.176
He got expelled today. ls that
in your story? 'Cause it should be.

01:09:42.562 --> 01:09:44.064
Is Van here?

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.564
He don't wanna see you.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.317
- Excuse me?
- Look.

01:09:47.401 --> 01:09:48.902
Why don't you just leave him alone?

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:51.488
Home wrecker.

01:10:30.736 --> 01:10:33.572
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:37.492
Out of my way!

01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:46.460
Stop packing!
You can appeal the expulsion.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:47.961
It's right here in the school's charter.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:49.838
"Any student has the right
to appeal an expulsion

01:10:49.921 --> 01:10:51.715
before the universityjudicial board

01:10:51.798 --> 01:10:54.468
and state his or her case within 48 hours
of being discharged."

01:10:55.886 --> 01:10:57.804
Do you want my hot tub,
or should I just give it to Milty?

01:10:57.888 --> 01:10:59.473
We can get
the law club to help us out.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:01.892
They owe you after the "Sue Me, Screw Me"
soiree you threw for them.

01:11:01.975 --> 01:11:05.604
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I'm really not interested.

01:11:05.687 --> 01:11:06.855
You're not hearing me...

01:11:06.938 --> 01:11:08.815
It's over, Taj!

01:11:12.319 --> 01:11:14.112
Fuck you, Van Wilder!

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.492
You heard me. I say... I say...

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:21.244
Fuck you, you, YOU. you"-

01:11:21.328 --> 01:11:22.829
You, you...

01:11:22.913 --> 01:11:24.664
You pussy ass motherfucker!

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.000
You... You dicksucker!

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:30.629
Don't sugarcoat it, Taj.
Tell me how you really feel.

01:11:30.712 --> 01:11:31.922
Seven years.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.301
Seven years!
I've accomplished nothing!

01:11:36.384 --> 01:11:38.303
There's no reason
to stay here anymore!

01:11:38.386 --> 01:11:40.096
Sure, sure.
You've made tons of friends

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.724
who in the drop of a rupee
would do anything for you,

01:11:42.808 --> 01:11:44.059
but that doesn't mean much, huh?

01:11:44.142 --> 01:11:47.020
And who cares about Sick Boy
and all the charities you've helped

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.023
and all of our athletics, huh?
Those are all so minuscule.

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:51.858
And "I guess so" is a promise

01:11:51.942 --> 01:11:54.402
made to a wet-behind-the-ears
kid from India

01:11:54.486 --> 01:11:58.615
whose only dream was to bury his face
in a beautiful woman's lotus patch.

01:11:58.698 --> 01:12:00.200
Tali»-...

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:03.370
You have shown me a life I could only
dream about back home

01:12:03.453 --> 01:12:06.373
while masturbating
in my father's woodshed.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:07.707
Most importantly,

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:09.084
you saw potential...

01:12:11.253 --> 01:12:14.464
in me.

01:12:14.548 --> 01:12:18.301
If you do not see potential in yourself,
then you are a blind man.

01:12:20.262 --> 01:12:21.638
I'm leaving.

01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:24.224
Then leave. But leave
the honorable way.

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:28.645
You've been looking for that
dare-to-be-great situation.

01:12:28.728 --> 01:12:31.189
It is at your doorstep.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.068
Van.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:36.486
We need to talk.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:50.584
Get me the law club.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.391
It's ridiculous! It's preposterous!

01:13:06.474 --> 01:13:08.935
It's ludicrous!
By God, it's impetuous!

01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:10.353
So does that mean you gonna help us?

01:13:10.437 --> 01:13:12.105
Oh, it's on.

01:13:33.418 --> 01:13:36.212
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

01:13:36.296 --> 01:13:39.049
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:44.054
We are now in session.
Mr. Wilder.

01:13:44.137 --> 01:13:49.309
You were found in violation of Article 2,
Section B of Coolidge's bylaws,

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:52.312
soliciting of alcohol to extreme minors

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:55.148
which is grounds for immediate expulsion.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.233
You have opted to appeal.

01:13:57.317 --> 01:13:58.652
The floor is yours.

01:14:01.988 --> 01:14:02.989
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:10.330
As you know, um,

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:13.333
I've been a student here for seven years,
and I've...

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:18.505
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!
Let Van stay!

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:25.679
Order! Order! Settle down, everyone.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.013
Continue, Mr. Wilder.

01:14:27.097 --> 01:14:29.182
I'm Okay!

01:14:29.265 --> 01:14:32.560
I've learned a lot here at Coolidge.

01:14:32.644 --> 01:14:35.689
Let the record show that, uh,

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:37.273
when I attended class,

01:14:37.357 --> 01:14:40.694
I did receive exemplary marks.

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:46.866
However, it was only when I met
a special someone

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.411
that I realized what I was doing.

01:14:49.494 --> 01:14:51.871
Hiding.

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:55.208
See, after this is real life,
and I wasn't ready for that.

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:57.210
I don't know why exactly.

01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:59.546
I do know that I don't wanna
end up like my father,

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.506
whose whole life
revolves around work.

01:15:01.589 --> 01:15:05.093
But I see that now. And, uh...

01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:08.013
I'm ready to move on.

01:15:08.096 --> 01:15:10.682
Well, that's that. Good luck, loser.
Who's ready for lunch?

01:15:10.765 --> 01:15:12.058
Mr. Bagg, you will be quiet.

01:15:12.142 --> 01:15:14.978
What's any of this got to do with the fact
that he's guilty of an infraction

01:15:15.061 --> 01:15:16.980
that deserves expulsion?

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:19.441
Mr. Wilder.

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:26.906
I can't argue against the infraction.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:30.160
I was responsible for that party,
so what happened was my fault.

01:15:30.243 --> 01:15:32.495
I'm here to lay myself at the mercy
of this court

01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:34.247
and suggest an alternative punishment.

01:15:35.874 --> 01:15:38.251
Make me graduate.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:39.502
If you'll kindly take a look
at my transcripts,

01:15:39.586 --> 01:15:41.796
you'll see I'm a mere 18 units
shy of graduating

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.423
with a degree in Leisure Studies.

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:46.259
I am pleading to this committee,
reinstate me.

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:48.887
Let me audit my last six classes,
take the necessary finals

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:51.514
and leave Coolidge with a degree.

01:15:55.977 --> 01:15:58.313
God, I've...

01:15:58.396 --> 01:16:03.777
bled crimson and blue
for nearly a decade.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.695
This school has given me so much.

01:16:05.779 --> 01:16:10.408
Let me repay Coolidge
by parting ways as a graduate.

01:16:21.544 --> 01:16:24.339
What are the courses Mr. Wilder needs
in order to graduate?

01:16:24.422 --> 01:16:27.050
Biology, English Lit, Calculus, Economics,

01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:28.802
Sociology and Political Science.

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:30.428
Wow. That's quite a load.

01:16:30.512 --> 01:16:32.931
Well, Van can handle quite a load.

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:38.311
If we expel him, there could be some
sort of a coup d'état.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.689
He broke a rule. He should pay
the consequences.

01:16:41.773 --> 01:16:46.528
Well, let's take a vote. There's five
of us here. Majority rules.

01:16:46.611 --> 01:16:48.154
I vote reinstatement.

01:16:48.238 --> 01:16:49.280
Mr. Bags?

01:16:49.364 --> 01:16:50.448
Expulsion.

01:16:50.532 --> 01:16:52.659
Miss Haver?

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:55.370
Reinstatement over and over.

01:16:55.453 --> 01:16:58.373
Okay. Uh, Mrs. Seay?

01:16:58.456 --> 01:16:59.541
Expulsion.

01:16:59.624 --> 01:17:01.084
Professor McDoogle?

01:17:01.167 --> 01:17:04.546
You know, I've waited a long, long time
for this day to come.

01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:06.548
Either way,

01:17:06.631 --> 01:17:08.967
Van Wilder's tenure
here at Coolidge is over.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.807
Let's see what the kid's made of.

01:17:17.183 --> 01:17:19.060
He's in! He's in!

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.781
Hey, Jeannie.

01:17:31.865 --> 01:17:35.368
Look. I just wanted to explain about the
whole, you know, Richard thing.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.204
See, me and Richard's unspoken bond
blossomed the other night

01:17:38.288 --> 01:17:40.331
in one beautiful, symbiotic act.

01:17:40.415 --> 01:17:42.041
What sort of act?

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.459
Messing up that Van Wilder party.

01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:46.880
And then we bumped uglies.

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.882
It was the best 10 seconds ever.

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:52.343
Even

01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:55.555
Yes, these interviews
are somewhat of a formality,

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:59.475
but I think it's crucial we like-minded
people get to know one another.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:04.606
Gwenny! Gwenny!

01:18:04.689 --> 01:18:06.065
Ah, I knew you'd come to your senses.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.525
Hello, Richard.

01:18:07.609 --> 01:18:09.235
All right, look. I know we have
a lot of surgery

01:18:09.319 --> 01:18:10.904
to perform
on our relationship. Okay?

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:14.032
But right now I am prepping
for the biggest moment of our lives.

01:18:14.115 --> 01:18:15.408
All right? I have a written exam first,

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:18.369
and then an interview with five
Northwestern alums.

01:18:18.453 --> 01:18:20.538
All doctors.

01:18:20.622 --> 01:18:23.249
That's why I came,
to help make you your shake.

01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:24.918
That'd be terrific, Gwenny.

01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:27.003
I'll see you downstairs.

01:18:27.086 --> 01:18:30.715
Oh, but hurry. lnterview's in a half hour,
other side of campus.

01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:33.885
Sorry about that.

01:18:42.435 --> 01:18:46.940
- Northwestern. I am the shit.
- You certainly will be.

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:49.525
Oh, Gwenny, thank you.

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.613
Mmm. Mmm.

01:18:54.781 --> 01:18:58.409
Good luck, honey. You deserve it.

01:18:58.493 --> 01:19:00.119
Yeah.

01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:04.707
Mmm.

01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:06.209
I certainly do.

01:19:26.396 --> 01:19:28.481
Oh...

01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:03.391
Oh!

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.650
Cytosine.

01:20:12.734 --> 01:20:14.610
Nothing but net, my man.

01:20:14.694 --> 01:20:18.323
Now remember, before any final,
take a pre-game dump.

01:20:34.547 --> 01:20:37.008
Thanks for coming in.
You did a great job, really.

01:20:37.091 --> 01:20:40.136
Richard! I was just talking about you.

01:20:40.219 --> 01:20:42.764
Hey, surprise.
I'm on your oral exam board.

01:20:42.847 --> 01:20:45.475
Look, come in here. I want you to meet
your future alumni.

01:20:45.558 --> 01:20:47.769
- I gotta go...
- No, come on. It's a great time.

01:20:47.852 --> 01:20:49.896
Look, it's Richard.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:51.564
Finished his written exam
in only 20 minutes.

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:53.399
This kid is a dynamo.

01:20:53.483 --> 01:20:56.444
Richard, I want you to meet Dr. Stern.

01:20:56.527 --> 01:20:57.528
Dr. Fine.

01:20:57.612 --> 01:21:01.449
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bagg.
I've heard a lot about you.

01:21:02.492 --> 01:21:04.118
Dr. Brown.

01:21:04.202 --> 01:21:05.453
These orals are something of a formality.

01:21:05.536 --> 01:21:08.289
We just want to get
to know you better.

01:21:08.373 --> 01:21:10.875
And Dr. Smelnick.

01:21:11.876 --> 01:21:14.128
Richard, is there something
you want to say?

01:21:14.212 --> 01:21:15.922
You look like you want
to get something out, son.

01:21:21.886 --> 01:21:23.096
Oh, my God!

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.146
- Vile.
- Oh, it burns!

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:37.026
I'm bleeding!

01:21:38.152 --> 01:21:39.695
Dear God, that's wretched.

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:06.472
"Oh, I kept the first for another day!

01:22:06.556 --> 01:22:09.475
Yet knowing how way leads on to way

01:22:09.559 --> 01:22:11.978
I doubted if I should ever come back."

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:14.605
I want you to tell me what Robert Frost
was trying to express here.

01:22:15.773 --> 01:22:18.109
I'm gonna need at least one more booklet.

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:21.154
What?

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.823
In other school news, we have an update
on the "Wilder Watch."

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:27.118
The rigorous day has been
a success for Van the man.

01:22:27.201 --> 01:22:32.165
<i>Five finals in the can with Professor
McDoogle's advanced econ final to go.</i>

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:34.375
Van? Van!

01:22:34.459 --> 01:22:37.712
Van! Van, wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:22:37.795 --> 01:22:39.755
- Your final's in exactly seven minutes!
- Okay. All right.

01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:56.272
It's the moment of truth, people.

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:11.370
Ah, Mr. Wilder.

01:23:11.454 --> 01:23:13.831
I'm so glad you could fit us
into your schedule this morning.

01:23:13.915 --> 01:23:15.458
Wouldn't miss it for the world, sir.

01:23:17.502 --> 01:23:19.253
All right.

01:23:19.337 --> 01:23:22.006
Pass these out. Thank you.

01:23:44.195 --> 01:23:45.738
It's getting to be that time of the hour.

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:53.788
And your time is up,
Mr. Wilder. Pencils down.

01:23:59.043 --> 01:24:00.461
- Thank you.
- For four years,

01:24:00.545 --> 01:24:02.964
<i>I have been grooming myself
for the real world.</i>

01:24:03.047 --> 01:24:05.299
<i>And I, like many of us,
define the real world</i>

01:24:05.383 --> 01:24:07.468
<i>as the stuff that happens
after graduation.</i>

01:24:07.552 --> 01:24:08.553
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

01:24:08.636 --> 01:24:12.265
<i>It took a man by the name
of Van Wilder to teach me that.</i>

01:24:12.348 --> 01:24:15.059
<i>You've all undoubtedly
been to one of Van's parties.</i>

01:24:15.142 --> 01:24:16.477
<i>He's probably touched your life
in some way,</i>

01:24:16.561 --> 01:24:18.396
<i>whether you know it or not.</i>

01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:20.940
<i>Watch Van do belly flops into a pool,</i>

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:23.401
<i>but make sure you see
that he's raised $5,000</i>

01:24:23.484 --> 01:24:25.778
<i>to give the swim team a next season.</i>

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:28.656
<i>As you're all aware,
Van was almost expelled.</i>

01:24:28.739 --> 01:24:31.242
<i>What you probably don't know is
that he was set up</i>

01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:33.369
<i>by a pathetic,
egomaniacal frat boy,</i>

01:24:33.452 --> 01:24:35.288
<i>one who this reporter knows firsthand</i>

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:37.999
<i>to have a serious problem
with premature ejaculation.</i>

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:41.502
<i>And in reaction to this lynching,</i>

01:24:41.586 --> 01:24:45.590
<i>Van put in more effort in six days
than most have all semester.</i>

01:24:45.673 --> 01:24:47.008
<i>Win or lose,
we should thank him</i>

01:24:47.091 --> 01:24:50.344
<i>for reminding us
what we're all capable of.</i>

01:24:50.428 --> 01:24:52.638
<i>That's simply what he does...</i>

01:24:52.722 --> 01:24:55.224
<i>He inspires the uninspired.</i>

01:25:00.271 --> 01:25:04.025
Van. Hurry. The night of fun
and fornication's upon us.

01:25:04.108 --> 01:25:07.028
Hey, have you heard from Gwen?

01:25:07.111 --> 01:25:09.363
No, she... She hasn't yet called back.

01:25:09.447 --> 01:25:12.325
Right. I'll be down
in a minute, okay?

01:25:12.408 --> 01:25:13.951
- Okay.
- See ya, V.

01:25:31.135 --> 01:25:33.137
Wilder.

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.513
McDoogle.

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:36.557
Jesus.

01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:39.352
This is some pad you got here.

01:25:39.435 --> 01:25:41.937
Decorated in early fuck.

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:49.654
Well, I made it a point to personally
come down here, Wilder.

01:25:49.737 --> 01:25:51.739
I wanted to give you the results
of your test firsthand.

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.451
And just as I expected,

01:25:55.534 --> 01:25:57.828
you succeeded.

01:25:57.912 --> 01:26:00.289
- 91%.
- What?

01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:03.709
I'm proud of you, Wilder.

01:26:03.793 --> 01:26:06.420
I've been waiting all these years
for you to realize your potential.

01:26:06.504 --> 01:26:08.255
That's why you
and I had friction?

01:26:08.339 --> 01:26:09.840
God, I always thought it was
'cause I fooled around

01:26:09.924 --> 01:26:11.676
with your daughter freshman year.

01:26:12.677 --> 01:26:15.971
Why? What...
You fooled around with my daughter?

01:26:16.055 --> 01:26:18.265
What?

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:36.575
Hey, I know you.

01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:39.286
- Thank you very much.
- You're the best, man.

01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:41.455
Hey, I couldn't have did it without you.
Appreciate it.

01:26:41.539 --> 01:26:43.708
I need youth fill up
the whole thing with ice.

01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:45.835
Pack as much as you can inside.

01:26:45.918 --> 01:26:48.212
- Okay? Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:26:50.256 --> 01:26:53.801
Hi. My name is
Orissa Punjab Nizamabad.

01:26:53.884 --> 01:26:55.219
Hi.

01:26:55.302 --> 01:26:57.555
I've just transferred
here from Banglapur.

01:27:06.856 --> 01:27:08.315
Hey. Excuse me.

01:27:08.399 --> 01:27:11.736
Can you tell me where I might find
the raddest fucking dude alive?

01:27:11.819 --> 01:27:15.114
Yeah, by the pool, Gramps.

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:18.451
Hey, I know you, man. Oh, fuck.

01:27:18.534 --> 01:27:21.495
Congratulations, Van.
I knew you had it in you.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.168
Dad. I can't believe you're here.

01:27:27.251 --> 01:27:28.753
I can't believe you graduated.

01:27:29.754 --> 01:27:32.965
A friend of yours sent me this.

01:27:34.592 --> 01:27:37.887
I'm proud of you, Van,
graduation or no graduation.

01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.389
Thank you.

01:27:40.473 --> 01:27:43.893
And I'm sorry that I spent such a buttload
of your money for so long.

01:27:43.976 --> 01:27:47.062
It's by far the best
investment I ever made.

01:27:57.448 --> 01:28:00.201
- You did good.
- Let's get this man lei'd.

01:28:01.786 --> 01:28:04.288
Meet my new girl.

01:28:19.678 --> 01:28:23.432
You look so...

01:28:23.516 --> 01:28:25.893
Wow. Wow.

01:28:25.976 --> 01:28:27.394
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:28:30.773 --> 01:28:31.774
Thank you.

01:28:35.986 --> 01:28:37.154
May I?

01:28:37.238 --> 01:28:39.323
As long as we cuddle afterwards.

01:28:44.036 --> 01:28:47.706
There's so much that I need
to say... The article...

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:57.716
I was scared that you wouldn't come.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.136
Well, I was trying to decide
what panties I should wear.

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.848
Which ones did you choose?

01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:06.100
None.

01:29:54.356 --> 01:29:56.483
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

01:29:56.567 --> 01:29:59.820
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas.

01:30:09.371 --> 01:30:10.706
You can't even... Oh.

01:30:11.749 --> 01:30:13.667
I mean, this girl is...

01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:16.962
I was wondering...

01:30:17.046 --> 01:30:18.505
I'll do it.

01:30:22.885 --> 01:30:25.012
I'm getting my shit together.
Just one second.

01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:28.390
I can't do this!

01:30:36.565 --> 01:30:37.566
Ugh!

01:30:38.567 --> 01:30:40.945
Oh, man. My mama never told me
I'd be doing this.

01:30:43.072 --> 01:30:44.907
I want to chew the choch.

01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:47.242
And then... I don't know how.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:00.589
Kids, this is what white jockey
blowin' hookers will do to you.
