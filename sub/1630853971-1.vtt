00:26.833 --> 00:27.666
<i>Billy?</i>

00:29.458 --> 00:30.291
<i>Yeah?</i>

00:34.541 --> 00:35.833
<i>How long we been friends?</i>

00:39.666 --> 00:40.583
<i>Since...</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:43.708
<i>forever.</i>

00:48.791 --> 00:50.708
<i>But... how long?</i>

00:52.958 --> 00:54.208
<i>I can't remember.</i>

00:58.000 --> 00:59.375
<i>You can't remember?</i>

01:01.541 --> 01:03.000
<i>I thought we was good buddies.</i>

01:06.625 --> 01:07.666
<i>We are.</i>

01:08.916 --> 01:11.875
<i>It's just that it's been so long,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

01:21.750 --> 01:23.125
-<i>Billy?</i>
-<i>Yeah?</i>

01:24.916 --> 01:28.250
<i>Don't ever forget me. Okay?</i>

01:29.583 --> 01:30.500
<i>No matter what.</i>

01:33.583 --> 01:34.416
<i>Never.</i>

01:35.541 --> 01:36.375
<i>Promise?</i>

01:39.416 --> 01:40.416
Ollie!

01:45.708 --> 01:48.208
<i>Cross my heart and hope to die.</i>

02:01.958 --> 02:05.250
Hiya, Flossie.
Got some good stuff for you today.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.916
-Got it from Lester McCubbin's place.
-Billy?

02:08.583 --> 02:10.500
-I hope he went easy.
-Billy?

02:10.583 --> 02:12.583
Old Lester never went easy on anything.

02:15.166 --> 02:18.125
I'll give you 20 for this one
and them other three.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.333
What is this place?

02:19.416 --> 02:20.583
Take it or leave it.

02:20.666 --> 02:23.500
-Oh, Lord, I'm in a dungeon.
-Fine. But I paid twice that.

02:23.916 --> 02:25.875
You know I love you.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.666
All right, I'll see you next time,
Flossie. You take care.

02:28.750 --> 02:29.750
-Hey!
-You too.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.708
-Billy? Are you out there?
-See you later.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.416
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.750
Can't see a damn thing anymore.

02:52.166 --> 02:56.083
Well... ain't you a handsome fella?

02:56.875 --> 03:00.166
Thanks. You're handsome too?

03:00.250 --> 03:02.000
Hey, have you seen--?

03:02.083 --> 03:03.083
Whoa! Uh...

03:03.166 --> 03:08.750
Easy. Now, I can't quite remember how
I got to wherever we are, but I think--

03:08.833 --> 03:10.333
Oh, please.

03:10.416 --> 03:14.541
No jangling. Thank you.
I think I might have lost my Billy.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.833
Maybe you could help me escape
so I can find him? Please?

03:21.125 --> 03:22.541
Oh, what's that?

03:22.625 --> 03:25.875
-Ouch! Ow. Ow!

03:27.083 --> 03:29.583
-I knew this was your dungeon.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.250
I'm warning you.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.041
I've got karate in my body
and lots of energy,

03:34.125 --> 03:38.000
and if you don't put me down right now--
I'm serious now.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.875
Bunnies are dangerous. We got sharp teeth.

03:42.708 --> 03:43.625
Ow.

03:46.583 --> 03:47.916
Looking sassy.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.416
You ain't gonna last long.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.208
I ain't gonna last long?

03:53.166 --> 03:56.000
Hey, wait, wait. No.
Oh, wait. Don't leave.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.208
Oh, please. I gotta get out!

03:59.166 --> 04:01.750
-Evening. How y'all folks doing?
-Thanks for nothing!

04:01.833 --> 04:03.208
Hey, there. Let's see...

04:07.125 --> 04:10.500
Okay. I guess that's how it is.
You're on your own, Ollie.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.375
Well, I ain't getting stuck
in this torture chamber. No, no, no.

04:14.458 --> 04:18.666
I gotta think straight.
Form a ninja escape plan.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.583
Hello?

04:23.000 --> 04:23.916
Hello.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.208
What's your name?

04:25.291 --> 04:27.791
Oh, thank God you can hear me.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.833
Are you trapped in here too?

04:29.916 --> 04:32.625
There's a crazy old lady
stabbing people in the ears.

04:33.125 --> 04:33.958
I'm Ollie.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.333
And I'm about to bust out of here
and find Billy. You wanna come?

04:37.416 --> 04:39.833
Which Billy? What's his last name?

04:40.333 --> 04:43.583
Billy-- Billy...

04:44.208 --> 04:45.375
Um...

04:46.375 --> 04:47.208
That's funny.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
I can't remember.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.041
Do you remember where he lives?

04:56.125 --> 04:57.291
Uh...

04:58.833 --> 04:59.666
In a house.

05:00.916 --> 05:01.750
Somewhere.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.041
There's woods, I think.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.000
Oh, why can't I remember?

05:12.166 --> 05:13.166
Come home with me.

05:13.250 --> 05:17.250
It's my birthday, and Daddy told me
I could pick out whatever I want

05:17.333 --> 05:19.500
as long as it's under $5.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.333
We can play games, snuggle in my bed.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.166
Oh.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.541
-Billy.
-Sue, you gotta hurry up, honey.

05:28.625 --> 05:29.541
Mama's waiting.

05:30.541 --> 05:31.708
Ollie, you coming?

05:32.708 --> 05:37.916
Thank you, really,
but... I gotta find my Billy.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.375
He could be out there looking for me.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.250
So... I have to keep looking for him.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.125
He needs me.

05:48.166 --> 05:51.041
I'll say a prayer for you tonight. Okay?

05:51.583 --> 05:52.541
Mm-hm.

06:00.541 --> 06:01.875
Y'all have a good night.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.333
-Thanks, you too.
-Bye.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.250
Oh, no. No. No!

06:09.333 --> 06:10.166
No, no, no!

06:14.375 --> 06:15.833
No, no, no.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.375
Oh! Ow!

07:01.208 --> 07:02.041
What--?

07:03.625 --> 07:04.625
Oh, no.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.000
Oh, no! No!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.958
Come on upstairs, Buttons.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.250
<i>Feud</i> is starting.

07:19.541 --> 07:20.666
Oh...

07:34.375 --> 07:36.583
Oh, come on! Come on!

07:36.666 --> 07:39.416
<i>She got tired of finding what in her bed?</i>

07:41.000 --> 07:41.833
<i>Wands.</i>

07:41.916 --> 07:42.750
-Wands?
-<i>Wands!</i>

07:43.250 --> 07:44.166
In the bed?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.333
Oh, no, I'm trapped.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.666
How am I gonna get out?

08:28.625 --> 08:29.791
Huh?

08:59.458 --> 09:00.500
Ah.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.000
-Oh, no.
-Land-ho!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.250
-Crash landing!
-He's on the ground!

09:35.583 --> 09:39.250
We must find the treasure
no matter the cost!

09:40.583 --> 09:43.500
Ahoy! The Haunted Cavern!

10:00.875 --> 10:02.625
You have found its partner.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.541
As long as these stars
are near each other...

10:07.250 --> 10:08.750
we shall never be apart.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.291
Ew.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.625
Oh.

10:29.208 --> 10:32.583
You... don't look like a Buttons.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.125
Hey, Buttons, you ugly mongrel.

11:04.666 --> 11:06.875
I think you dropped your balls.

11:36.916 --> 11:38.333
Hey, you stupid mutt!

11:40.166 --> 11:42.291
You put him down right now. Or I will--

11:43.000 --> 11:45.291
Oh, Lord, what am I doing?

11:53.208 --> 11:55.625
Buttons!
Get your ass back to bed!

12:13.541 --> 12:15.625
Are you--? Are you all right?

12:17.791 --> 12:18.875
Oh, no.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.541
Oh, that just don't look right.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.125
Oh, my Lord.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.416
Oh. Oh!

12:26.916 --> 12:27.958
Are you okay?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.750
Well, hello there.

12:33.083 --> 12:37.375
No. Something don't feel quite right.

12:38.166 --> 12:41.375
Ah. How's about helping a feller out?

12:45.166 --> 12:46.125
Uh-huh.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.125
Thank you kindly.

12:48.208 --> 12:49.791
We ain't been introduced.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.125
I am Zozo. And you are...?

12:52.208 --> 12:53.250
I'm Ollie.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.791
Well, good to meet you, Ollie.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.208
Now, let's just turn it down a tetch.

12:57.708 --> 12:59.916
Use our church voices, okay?

13:00.583 --> 13:05.041
Don't want Flossie letting Buttons
back out on the loose, understand?

13:05.125 --> 13:05.958
Mm-hm.

13:06.041 --> 13:10.666
Yeah. In light of that,
let's get somewhere that Buttons ain't.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.583
Sound good, Ollie?

13:12.666 --> 13:13.833
Mm-hm.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.291
Stop gulping like a catfish
and come on in.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.291
Well, what do you know? We're here.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.791
Casa Del Zozo.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.375
Wow.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.458
Well, what you think?

14:11.500 --> 14:12.875
It's beautiful.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.000
Whoa, now.
You're missing part of yourself, bunny.

14:20.083 --> 14:20.958
Huh?

14:21.625 --> 14:24.583
Your insides
is about to become your outsides.

14:24.666 --> 14:27.625
Oh, Lord. We got to fix that
before it gets worse.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.708
I ain't got no needle and thread, but--

14:33.666 --> 14:34.583
Oh, here we go.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.458
Let's see if the king can help.

14:38.583 --> 14:39.625
The king.

14:40.791 --> 14:41.916
But who's the king?

14:42.291 --> 14:43.208
Oh.

14:44.375 --> 14:47.583
-Ah!
-You are squirrelier than a pig in a poke.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.791
Settle down. Let me work.

14:53.708 --> 14:56.875
<i>Et voil√†.</i> You are all fixed up.

14:58.583 --> 14:59.666
Hmm.

15:01.583 --> 15:02.500
Huh.

15:03.291 --> 15:05.416
How did your face get all messed up?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.666
You ought not to point things out
like that, Ollie. It ain't polite.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.750
Oh. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
I think it looks cool.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.208
Like a pirate.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.291
I like pirates.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.250
I like pirates too.

15:25.083 --> 15:25.916
Peace bringer.

15:26.791 --> 15:29.375
-Huh?
-Your name, Ollie.

15:30.083 --> 15:33.041
Oliver. It means "peace bringer."

15:33.125 --> 15:34.041
Oh.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.833
You been here a long time?

15:40.625 --> 15:42.541
Ten years? Fifty?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.125
Were you born here?

15:45.666 --> 15:47.375
Were you trapped by monsters?

15:47.458 --> 15:50.125
Yeah. It was a monster.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.791
The Goat Man of Fisherville.

15:53.291 --> 15:54.750
He took me away.

15:55.416 --> 15:58.166
Carried me yonder to Timbuktu.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.375
Nearly took my head off.

16:01.958 --> 16:03.875
-And he's standing right behind you!

16:05.916 --> 16:09.000
It ain't funny. I don't like being teased!

16:09.583 --> 16:10.541
Bullies tease!

16:10.625 --> 16:14.083
Oh, now, quit acting
like a stepped-on copperhead.

16:14.166 --> 16:17.416
I ain't no bully.
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.833
I apologize
for my friend. He ain't no count.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.250
He's a bit of a clown.

16:25.166 --> 16:26.708
Now, let's talk about you.

16:27.416 --> 16:30.833
Where did you come from? Why are you here?

16:30.916 --> 16:33.750
And how come your ears
don't stand up straight like Bugs Bunny?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.125
I got lost.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.958
My best friend Billy,
I don't know where he is.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.291
I can't-- I can't remember.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.916
Well, that ain't no good.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.666
Do you remember how you got here?

16:54.833 --> 16:55.791
I was trapped.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.500
Trapped in a box.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.250
It was dark,
then... everything started shaking.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.541
And then, boom,
it come crashing down like--

17:03.625 --> 17:05.291
Like that house caught up in a tornado

17:05.375 --> 17:07.625
in that movie with the girl
and the lion and the metal man.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.166
Ha! <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah! <i>The Wizard of Oz!</i>

17:13.083 --> 17:16.375
And then this old lady
rips me out of the box, and pop!

17:16.458 --> 17:19.416
Hurts my ear, drags me through the store
and throws me on a shelf.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.208
And a little girl wanted me to go
with her, but I didn't. And now-- now--

17:24.500 --> 17:27.666
Oh, and now I might be here
for a long, long time,

17:27.750 --> 17:29.708
and I can't be because--

17:30.875 --> 17:31.708
Because...

17:37.083 --> 17:39.500
Oh, no. Billy's in trouble.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.583
I gotta find him.

17:43.000 --> 17:43.875
He needs me.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.916
Did your star tell you all that?

17:47.791 --> 17:49.333
Take a minute and breathe.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.500
I don't need to breathe.
I need to find Billy.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.708
Come on, sourpuss, breathe with me.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.291
Now, memories are funny.

18:05.375 --> 18:09.166
You gotta kind of sneak up on them
or they'll just disappear.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.666
To figure out what's in your head...

18:14.541 --> 18:17.125
sometimes you gotta figure out
what's in your heart.

18:27.583 --> 18:28.708
So go slow now.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.625
Start from the beginning.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.083
Before today.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.750
<i>We shall never be apart.</i>

18:50.000 --> 18:51.250
Avast, ye matey!

18:51.333 --> 18:54.875
There be marauders approaching
from the starboard side!

19:05.208 --> 19:06.041
What is this?

19:07.666 --> 19:09.500
Damn it, Billy. What's with this mess?

19:09.583 --> 19:12.583
You know better than this.
Your mama ain't feeling well.

19:12.666 --> 19:15.208
-She needs her rest.
-We was just playing.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.333
We weren't doing nothing bad.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.125
All right. All right. Okay.

19:21.791 --> 19:22.708
Um...

19:27.833 --> 19:31.500
Billy, you need to grow up
a little bit for me. All right?

19:32.375 --> 19:36.875
With things how they are, I need you to--
You know, I need you to be tough for me.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.708
You can't keep acting like...

19:40.166 --> 19:43.791
you know, some-- Some baby.
Do you understand?

19:45.375 --> 19:46.208
Daddy.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.500
Daddy, what's all this ruckus about?

19:51.750 --> 19:54.625
Can't you see
that Billy's trying to build an adventure?

19:54.708 --> 19:57.125
-Yeah. We're just talking.
-Mm-hm.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.875
Darling. You need your rest.

19:59.958 --> 20:02.583
I will. I promise.

20:04.541 --> 20:09.791
But... right now, we are in the presence
of the pirate king.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.666
Bow to your king, good knight.
Come on. Bow.

20:14.666 --> 20:17.208
-Bow to your king, good knight.
-You gotta be kidding me.

20:17.291 --> 20:21.041
Hey, come on. Bow. Bow I say! Come on.
Bow to your king. Get rid of that hat.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.583
-Now, that's a fine knight.

20:27.416 --> 20:28.541
Dance with me.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.833
-My queen.
-Yeah?

20:37.916 --> 20:38.750
Now...

20:40.208 --> 20:44.416
I haven't much time. I must away
for a private audience with the king.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.041
Shall we, king? Here we go.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.541
<i>You know your daddy</i>
<i>don't mean nothing, right?</i>

20:59.791 --> 21:03.125
He's just tired, you know? And there's--

21:04.833 --> 21:06.708
There's a lot on his shoulders right now.

21:11.166 --> 21:13.791
I don't think he wants me
to play with Ollie.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.083
Wanna hear a funny story about your daddy?
It's a good one.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.958
When your daddy was little,

21:29.500 --> 21:32.708
he had this old beagle hound
named Princess.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.666
Sweetest little thing,
but she was getting old, hard of hearing.

21:35.750 --> 21:39.666
-Anyway, your daddy had this Army doll--
-Daddy played with toys?

21:39.750 --> 21:42.958
He sure did.
And this one was his favorite.

21:43.708 --> 21:46.333
Well, your daddy goes into the living room

21:46.416 --> 21:49.791
and he sees Princess
sitting right on top of Mr. G.I. Joe,

21:49.875 --> 21:51.583
and he starts yelling,

21:51.666 --> 21:54.625
but Princess can't hear him
because she's deaf and will not move.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.041
So your daddy decides
he's gonna make her move.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.291
So he rears up, right?

21:59.375 --> 22:02.375
He gets ready to hit
that old beagle hound with his bare foot,

22:02.458 --> 22:04.625
and when he goes to kick her,
Princess stands up

22:04.708 --> 22:07.000
and his toe goes
right where the sun don't shine.

22:07.083 --> 22:07.916
No.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah. Hand to God.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.250
Hand to God.

22:11.875 --> 22:16.333
And when your daddy pulled that toe out,
old Princess got her revenge,

22:16.416 --> 22:20.125
because that Princess
just evacuated all over Mr. G.I. Joe.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.250
Oh, it was so nasty!

22:23.333 --> 22:24.750
Oh!

22:27.208 --> 22:28.041
What is this?

22:29.541 --> 22:30.958
Huh? Tell me.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.833
Who did this?
Was that that Mike Apple boy?

22:38.541 --> 22:41.458
He twisted my arm
and tried to make me say it.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.416
That we ain't your real mama and daddy?

22:45.833 --> 22:46.666
Look at me.

22:47.708 --> 22:49.000
We talked about this.

22:50.208 --> 22:53.625
-Okay? Me and your daddy love you--
-I didn't say it, Mama.

22:54.250 --> 22:57.291
No matter how hard he squeezed.
I'd never say it.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.083
I know you wouldn't, baby. Come here.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.166
I know you wouldn't.

23:01.916 --> 23:03.250
I'm sorry you have to.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.666
But you have to, you know,
take up for yourself sometimes.

23:10.583 --> 23:14.000
You know, he ain't-- He's nothing
but a little pissant in a pit bull's body.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.333
You add anything new
to your memory map today?

23:21.208 --> 23:22.833
No. Not today.

23:26.166 --> 23:29.916
It's really important, you know?
We wanna make sure we're working

23:30.000 --> 23:32.291
at keeping track
of all the things that we've done,

23:32.875 --> 23:34.583
all the things we hope to do.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.333
You kept my stars?

23:41.250 --> 23:42.208
Mm-hm.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.708
The Mountain Queen...

23:50.375 --> 23:53.583
stole the stars from the night sky.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.125
Bing, bing.

23:56.916 --> 24:00.333
Turned them to gold and christened them.

24:00.833 --> 24:04.291
-The Twin Stars of Enchantment.
-Right.

24:04.375 --> 24:07.125
And only the pure of heart may wield them.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.208
Are you and your squire pure of heart?

24:09.291 --> 24:14.208
Because if you are not pure of heart
and you use these stars, you'll die...

24:14.708 --> 24:17.875
...of laughing sickness!

24:22.166 --> 24:24.125
<i>-Te amo.</i>
<i>-Te amo.</i>

24:48.291 --> 24:51.333
-What did you see? Anything helpful?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.208
The memory wall.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.708
Places he went with Mama and Daddy.

25:08.750 --> 25:12.000
All the things we'd done,
all the things we hoped to do.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.666
Hold on a minute.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.291
Zozo? Zozo, what's up?

25:53.583 --> 25:55.583
Zozo. What you doing?

25:55.666 --> 25:56.666
Shh!

25:56.750 --> 25:59.083
-Zozo, you done yet?
-Good Lord, you're impatient.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.625
Give me a sec. I need to think.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.833
A map. Well, not... really.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.000
Something like a map.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.833
But, Ollie, I know some of these places.

26:09.916 --> 26:10.875
Not all of them.

26:12.833 --> 26:16.125
Now, the Dark River,
that could be the Ohio.

26:16.666 --> 26:19.750
Mark Twain, not sure about that one.
There's some fuzzy areas.

26:20.291 --> 26:22.458
I ain't never seen no trolls, but...

26:23.791 --> 26:28.666
If you can remember more, we might be able
to use it and find your way home.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.583
You'd leave here?

26:33.833 --> 26:35.416
You'd help me find Billy?

26:38.583 --> 26:39.500
Oh.

26:40.416 --> 26:41.250
I'm sorry.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.500
I didn't mean
to give you the wrong impression.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.083
You gotta help me.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.291
Don't you have somebody you love?

26:51.375 --> 26:54.375
Somebody that you'd do
anything to be with?

26:55.458 --> 26:56.541
Yes.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.333
And she's gone!

27:17.333 --> 27:18.583
Her name was Nina.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.041
Crystal eyes.

27:26.916 --> 27:32.083
A dancing doll
that twirled like a feather on wind.

27:35.666 --> 27:39.708
She's the only one who ever cared for me.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.583
I loved her with all my heart.

27:44.416 --> 27:45.750
And when I lost her...

27:49.791 --> 27:51.875
I looked for years, Ollie...

27:53.041 --> 27:54.958
searching high and low.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.541
And you know what I found?

27:59.041 --> 27:59.875
Nothing.

28:01.583 --> 28:04.083
I'm done searching
for things I can't find.

28:05.916 --> 28:09.166
And I think it's best
that we just stay put...

28:10.833 --> 28:11.833
where we're safe.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.208
You can't trust this old world, Ollie.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.458
You can trust me.

28:24.625 --> 28:25.583
She's out there.

28:26.875 --> 28:27.958
Billy's out there.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.291
We'll do it together.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.041
Help each other.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.125
If we're gonna do this, partner...

28:41.458 --> 28:44.708
we gotta figure out a way
out of here first, don't you think?

28:51.083 --> 28:53.041
Are you sure Buttons gets out this way?

28:53.750 --> 28:56.625
That's why they call it a dog door.

29:05.250 --> 29:06.083
Dang it!

29:06.833 --> 29:09.166
Shh. Church voices.

29:09.250 --> 29:10.083
Remember?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.875
Touch√©.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.750
Well, you got any ideas?

29:15.833 --> 29:17.208
Because I am fresh out.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.250
Uh...

29:21.458 --> 29:23.791
What time does Buttons get up?

29:30.541 --> 29:32.833
I know karate.
I'm an expert in karate and kung fu.

29:32.916 --> 29:34.666
Scorpion-style, toad-style, all of it.

29:34.750 --> 29:38.375
I can kick and flip and spin,
so don't you worry about old Buttons.

29:38.458 --> 29:39.500
He won't have a chance.

29:40.166 --> 29:41.375
Is that right?

29:41.458 --> 29:42.791
Yep. Sure is.

29:55.958 --> 29:57.666
Hold on. Hold on.

30:10.958 --> 30:13.708
Where did he go?
I can't see him.

30:13.791 --> 30:15.250
Shh.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.583
Be patient.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.041
Now.

30:46.750 --> 30:47.583
Yes.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.000
-You go first. I'm right behind you.
-Okay.

31:00.708 --> 31:03.458
Wait. My star is gone.

31:03.541 --> 31:04.833
I don't have my star.

31:04.916 --> 31:06.708
We don't have time to go back.

31:06.791 --> 31:08.166
We gotta go. Now!

31:08.250 --> 31:09.833
Oh, please. Please.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.458
We need the star to find Billy!

31:13.416 --> 31:15.333
Oh, good Lord.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.083
All right, fine.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.666
There it is.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.083
-I got it.

31:26.166 --> 31:27.166
-Zozo!

32:10.083 --> 32:11.291
Come on. Zozo.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.416
Oh, my leg popped out again.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.625
Give me a sec.

32:16.791 --> 32:18.166
Go on. Get out of here, Ollie.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.875
-I'm not leaving you.
-I'll be fine.

32:20.916 --> 32:23.875
-Come on, get up. Get up!
-Ollie, get out of here.

32:23.958 --> 32:26.125
Get up!

32:29.875 --> 32:30.916
Down, boy.

32:41.625 --> 32:42.875
Whoa!

32:50.041 --> 32:51.166
Bullies look tough.

32:54.291 --> 32:56.208
But they got sensitive nostrils.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.541
That was amazing.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.000
Rosy.

33:06.083 --> 33:06.916
Zozo.

33:07.625 --> 33:08.458
It--

33:09.333 --> 33:10.833
It's been a while.

33:10.916 --> 33:12.666
You followed me.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.458
I told you not to.

33:14.541 --> 33:16.083
I was worried.

33:16.750 --> 33:17.708
You just left.

33:19.416 --> 33:20.666
I didn't want you to.

33:24.041 --> 33:25.666
Are those lightsabers?

33:25.750 --> 33:26.666
Are you a Jedi?

33:27.291 --> 33:31.000
-How did you get lightning on your eye?
-Paws off. Swords ain't for bunnies.

33:31.666 --> 33:34.791
-Who the heck are you anyway?
-Whoa, now. Settle down.

33:34.875 --> 33:36.000
That there's Ollie.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.416
He's a friend.

33:38.375 --> 33:41.000
Wait. Are y'all boyfriend and girlfriend?

33:42.250 --> 33:44.750
Remember that patience we discussed?

33:45.333 --> 33:46.416
Go find some.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.083
Huh?

34:19.750 --> 34:20.583
<i>Billy?</i>

34:22.875 --> 34:23.708
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:26.291 --> 34:27.958
How long we been friends?

34:29.291 --> 34:30.125
Since...

34:33.541 --> 34:34.375
Forever.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.291
But how long?

34:40.083 --> 34:41.375
<i>I can't remember.</i>

34:42.958 --> 34:44.333
<i>You can't remember?</i>

34:49.625 --> 34:51.416
<i>I thought we was good buddies.</i>

34:52.333 --> 34:53.166
<i>We are.</i>

34:53.833 --> 34:56.791
<i>It's just that it's been so long,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

35:03.791 --> 35:04.625
Billy?

35:05.666 --> 35:06.500
Yeah?

35:07.583 --> 35:08.833
Don't ever forget me.

35:10.083 --> 35:10.916
Okay?

35:12.041 --> 35:12.958
No matter what.

35:16.666 --> 35:17.500
Never.

35:19.916 --> 35:20.750
Promise?

35:27.750 --> 35:28.666
Cross my heart.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.333
And I hope to die.

35:34.375 --> 35:35.208
It's real.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.083
I knew it.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.791
-Ollie!
-I found it.

35:42.375 --> 35:45.000
-Ollie!

35:46.666 --> 35:48.708
I found it!

35:51.541 --> 35:52.916
I found it!

35:53.000 --> 35:55.583
I found it! I found it! I found it!

35:57.416 --> 35:59.500
I found the Dark River!

36:05.583 --> 36:07.458
The Ohio River.

36:09.291 --> 36:12.958
Filled with danger and mystery, Ollie.

36:14.666 --> 36:17.583
Good place to start a quest.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.416
Do you think
he's out there looking for me?

36:32.583 --> 36:33.875
<i>Ollie!</i>

36:34.875 --> 36:37.333
<i>Ollie!</i>
