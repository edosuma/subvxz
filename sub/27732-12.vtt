00:16.182 --> 00:19.936
This is Mahoney heading
into the 15th Precinct with Frank Castle.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.312
In an ambulance?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.940
I'm in an ambulance,
but that wasn't the important part.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.858
I got Frank Castle.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.193
Why are you
in an ambulance, Mahoney?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.528
Jeez.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.948
Things got a little unconventional.
Just have the welcoming committee ready.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.409
-We should be there in less than ten.
-Copy that.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.662
Shit like stealing an ambulance
and kidnapping...

00:38.288 --> 00:40.832
might just be Tuesday to you,
but this ain't me, man.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.500
I think you're doing great.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.546
Oh, thank you very much.
So glad to have your seal of approval.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.632
And how come you're so calm, huh?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.301
I'm taking you to jail forever.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.595
It's gonna be
what it's gonna be, Mahoney.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.556
Tell you the truth,

00:57.182 --> 00:58.808
I'd mostly just like to get some sleep.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.354
God damn it!

01:04.647 --> 01:06.858
-Hey! Watch the road.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.235
I'm a simple man, you know?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.863
I got you, now I'm locking you up.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.325
I don't give a shit
about whatever unholy deals were made

01:15.408 --> 01:19.954
between you and Madani, Russo, Homeland,
the goddamn Illuminati, whatever.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.627
-What?
-Just stop and talk to me.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.838
We got nothing to talk about, Madani.
You lied to me. For the last time.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.923
I had my reasons.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.301
Yeah, and you can tell me all about 'em
when I come and arrest you.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.470
Plan on that for later today, by the way.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.851
About time.

01:51.903 --> 01:52.821
Are you hit?

02:03.164 --> 02:05.458
Mahoney! Hey,
I need a key for these cuffs!

02:05.542 --> 02:07.919
Hell no! Ain't gonna happen, Frank.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.880
-Damn it! I need a key for these cuffs!
-No! No!

02:23.685 --> 02:25.145
-Shit!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.555
Homeland Security!

05:22.613 --> 05:25.783
God... damn it.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.288
Shit.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.687
Frank.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.814
Frank.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
You're gonna be all right. You hear me?

06:04.822 --> 06:05.990
Help's on the way.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.117
You're gonna be all right.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.672
God damn.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.344
Shit. Shit.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.891
God...

06:35.395 --> 06:39.440
God damn it.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.402
Okay.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.367
Shit.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.202
Shit.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
Frank!

06:59.127 --> 07:01.337
Son of a bitch. Come on.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.181
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.519
Come on.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.729
That's it. Here we go.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.773
That's it. Come on. I got you.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.442
Let's go. Come on.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.113
Come on.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.955
Come on.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.707
I got you.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.002
Come on. I got you.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.260
Come on.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.768
That's it.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.771
Here we go.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.237
Gotta go.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.574
You can't leave, Frank.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
You can't leave. You can't leave, Frank.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.666
I can't let you just walk away, Frank.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.752
Frank!

08:38.643 --> 08:40.311
Well, you do what you gotta do.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
According to the detective I spoke to,

10:21.704 --> 10:23.581
the unknown assailant
rammed the ambulance,

10:23.664 --> 10:26.042
forcing it from the bridge
before escaping.

10:26.125 --> 10:26.959
At this point,

10:27.043 --> 10:30.338
we don't know if this man was trying
to free Frank Castle or assassin--

10:34.842 --> 10:37.136
Were you gonna... tell me?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.222
I didn't...

10:42.433 --> 10:43.684
It doesn't matter.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.519
What doesn't?

10:45.603 --> 10:48.606
That Frank escaped,
or that you wanted to hide it from me?

10:49.940 --> 10:53.069
What

10:55.321 --> 10:57.156
I really wasn't thinking at all.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.949
Hmm. You're always thinking.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.369
This doesn't change anything.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.539
Okay. So why try to keep it from me?

11:05.623 --> 11:06.499
Because...

11:07.625 --> 11:11.295
he just... He never ends.
He keeps on coming and that scares me.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.007
The man is... relentless.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.386
He's got nothing else.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.931
And I do?

11:22.765 --> 11:23.849
That your point?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.395
Don't do that. Wait...

11:28.479 --> 11:30.147
You're punishing me for what?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.818
Just one minute not wanting
that man to ruin everything?

11:36.612 --> 11:38.155
And now you're acting cold,

11:38.239 --> 11:41.409
and I can't tell if that's
because you're pissed off at me or...

11:41.492 --> 11:43.327
you're getting ready to go after him.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.958
I'm going to get our paperwork.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.001
Okay?

11:52.044 --> 11:53.212
Just like we planned.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.468
You can leave this alone?

12:01.470 --> 12:06.225
Listen, the way that I have felt
since I've been done with him...

12:07.435 --> 12:10.771
just to stay here with you,
I've never felt that.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.732
I've never felt that...

12:14.483 --> 12:15.526
happy.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.946
So I figure that you're right.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.324
Once you cut that cancer out...

12:25.745 --> 12:27.163
you don't let it back in.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.421
Promise me you'll be back?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.051
Won't be long.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.101
Hey. Are you okay?

13:33.270 --> 13:35.231
Yeah. I'm all right.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.192
It's amazing no one got killed.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.779
I'd be barbecue right now
if it wasn't for Castle.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.491
Came back and pulled me out.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.996
Then I pulled my gun on him,
and he just, uh... walked away.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.876
-He could have just let me burn.
-No, Mahoney.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.505
No, he couldn't, in the same way
that you couldn't shoot him in the back.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.965
Why did you help him?

14:02.424 --> 14:06.595
In the hospital.
You had to know it would end your career.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.640
I was planning on coming after you hard.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.934
I know how you feel.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.103
You're in the middle of this, this...

14:14.895 --> 14:16.772
insanity, and you're trying
to find some sense.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.775
But here's what I can tell you.
Frank is not a criminal.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.738
He is not a hero either.
He is just... He's Frank.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.782
And what am I
supposed to do with that, Madani?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.492
You're not supposed to do
anything with it.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.286
I'm just telling you how it is.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.625
-Okay, now get some... Get some rest.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.710
Excuse me.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.173
Hi, Dr. Dumont.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.259
Dinah, hey, is everything okay?

14:45.801 --> 14:46.760
With you, I mean?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.221
I saw the news, that you were involved.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.557
Maybe Frank hurt you.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.060
Uh, no, I'm not on his list. Don't worry.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.773
Do you know where he might be

15:01.025 --> 15:02.026
I...

15:02.860 --> 15:04.528
What if he comes after me?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.197
Could he do that?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.325
If he thought maybe...

15:10.701 --> 15:12.703
I knew where Billy was or...

15:12.786 --> 15:15.581
This whole thing
is just too much, isn't it?

15:15.664 --> 15:17.541
And what about Billy? Has he...

15:18.667 --> 15:20.127
Do you have any leads?

15:20.210 --> 15:21.462
What are you gonna do?

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
The investigation is still going on,

15:23.297 --> 15:26.300
so I can't really talk...
Are you okay, Krista?

15:26.383 --> 15:27.676
Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.428
It's just...

15:30.012 --> 15:31.889
this hell never ends, does it?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.318
You know what? Don't worry.
I think Billy's long gone by now.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.861
I'll tell you what. I'll...

15:46.654 --> 15:50.658
I'll keep you posted if anything happens
with either Castle or Billy.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.536
Just to give you a peace of mind,
you know?

15:55.245 --> 15:56.455
I'd appreciate that.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.882
It's O'Rourke.

16:08.133 --> 16:13.389
O-R-O-U-R-K-E.
Badge number five-two-zero-six.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.933
Yeah, I'm looking for an address.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.412
-Afternoon, ma'am.
-Good afternoon.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.421
Uh, can I help, Officer?

17:40.934 --> 17:44.313
Just take whatever you want.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.941
Yeah, that's how
it works for you, huh?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.527
"Just take whatever you want"?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.405
Kill anyone who gets in the way, huh?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.492
Who are you

17:57.242 --> 17:58.702
That's what you're gonna do.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.288
Pretend that you don't know who I am.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.415
Huh

18:03.499 --> 18:05.459
Whatever you think, I don't know you.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.295
This all seems like such a...
Such a terrible mistake!

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
"Mistake," huh?

18:13.926 --> 18:17.262
What about those kids in Chicago

18:18.597 --> 18:20.808
How about that sheriff's station
you shot up?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.811
Dead Russians That ring a bell?

18:23.894 --> 18:27.731
Dead kids? I am a US Senator.
If you think a crime has been committed--

18:27.815 --> 18:30.234
Let me tell you something.
I ain't falling for your act.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.654
That asshole that works for you, he just
shot up a highway, coming after me.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.739
You know, the only reason
you're breathing right now,

18:35.823 --> 18:37.032
you're gonna help me find him.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.742
Get your ass up. Get your ass up.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.955
Who the hell are you?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.005
Are you expecting trouble?

19:33.547 --> 19:37.092
Around here, there's no telling who's
gonna come through your front door, right?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.553
You don't look too good yourself, friend.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.475
It has been a testing day.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.520
Have a seat.

20:22.471 --> 20:26.725
If you go for that shotgun, I'm gonna put
a bullet in your kneecap, okay?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.687
And trust me, that doesn't feel too good.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.995
How do you know Dinah Madani?

20:49.414 --> 20:51.250
I mean, how do you think I know her?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.502
She comes here from time to time.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.381
Even cops need a little booty call
every now and then, right?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.677
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.139
I think you're lying.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.433
Man, what do you want?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.896
I don't have much, but if you see
something that'll help, just take it.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.940
Castle and the girl.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.858
Who?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.444
I have no quarrel with you,

21:20.445 --> 21:22.406
but I also have very little time.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.992
So, if they're your friends,

21:25.659 --> 21:29.663
and you're thinking of showing them
loyalty, of protecting them,

21:30.539 --> 21:32.624
it would be better if you didn't.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.674
Still, I don't know anything
about any Castle or girl.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.347
Like Peter, you deny this man.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.192
You know, there was a time
not so long ago,

21:59.276 --> 22:02.321
I would have judged you
before even sitting down with you,

22:02.404 --> 22:04.197
before speaking with you.

22:05.282 --> 22:09.661
Just a glance, and I would have
seen you as unclean, a dishonest man.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.912
Less than human.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.168
It was a brutal life.
I've put that behind me.

22:17.085 --> 22:22.341
But here, now,
I can see you clearly, without hate.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.763
And while I admire your bravery...

22:30.390 --> 22:31.933
I do not believe you.

22:34.102 --> 22:38.023
This is not a place where people live.
This is a place where people hide.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.068
And while I respect what you're doing,
protecting a friend--

22:41.151 --> 22:43.236
Curtis! Curtis!

22:43.320 --> 22:44.905
Curtis, we got him out. He's...

23:16.061 --> 23:17.062
Run!

24:45.066 --> 24:46.359
You could have all run.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.572
Taken this shit and gone.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.618
But here you are.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.871
Yeah, all five of us, Billy.

24:57.954 --> 25:01.082
What went down, that was messed up.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.585
We should have just killed Castle.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.795
What

25:07.339 --> 25:09.341
We were always on borrowed time, man.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.303
It was always gonna end up this way.

25:13.386 --> 25:17.098
He killed a lot of our friends,
and escaped.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.808
Yeah.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.894
So it's just not you and him now.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.104
We owe him some payback.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.441
And with this, we could finish him.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.197
They say he's hurt, on the run.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.157
I say we hunt him down.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.369
We owe that to the others.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.664
Look, I get it. Okay? I do.

25:42.415 --> 25:46.419
But killing Frank Castle...
that won't bring them back.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.881
And now... And now,
you all have something to lose.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.679
You're gonna let Castle slide?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.266
That's bullshit.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.153
A lot of people died because of Frank.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.656
And that's...

26:17.117 --> 26:18.285
Well, that's on me.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.747
But I won't let another one of you die

26:22.831 --> 26:25.000
or spend your life in a cage
because of him.

26:27.210 --> 26:30.088
So I suggest that you take your shit
and you go,

26:31.715 --> 26:34.175
and you find something that's worth more.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.189
There's one each.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.817
New names.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.446
New lives.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.448
My gift to you.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.332
Where you going?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.211
It's not where I'm going.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.342
It's who I'm going with.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.554
It's been an honor, boys.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.915
No.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.792
No, no, no.

27:48.875 --> 27:49.834
Curtis.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.253
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.255
-Are you all right?
-Shit.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.882
-Where is she?
-Amy.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.510
Where is she, Curt -Amy. Amy...

27:58.593 --> 28:01.388
-The preacher-looking guy--
-He was here, Curtis

28:01.471 --> 28:02.806
-And then she--
-Did he take her?

28:02.889 --> 28:04.683
She showed up,
and I grabbed him, and she ran.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.601
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. She ran?
-She ran.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.019
-She ran.
-God damn it!

28:08.603 --> 28:09.688
God damn it!

28:16.903 --> 28:19.280
Where'd she go -

28:19.864 --> 28:20.949
God damn it.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.744
All right. All right.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.540
You got your phone?

28:33.920 --> 28:34.921
Come on, kid.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.173
-Come on.
-She ran.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.633
Where's it...

28:38.967 --> 28:41.052
Hey. Hey.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.082
Damn it, Frank.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.152
Get your ass out.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.906
-Come on. Get your...

29:46.284 --> 29:47.452
Who the hell is that?

29:53.750 --> 29:56.753
-It's David Schultz.
-US Senator Schultz?

29:57.545 --> 29:59.088
Yeah, he keeps telling me that.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.924
Jesus, Frank.

30:01.424 --> 30:02.842
Ow!

30:03.426 --> 30:04.427
Shut up.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.096
Look at me, asshole.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.936
I do not have time for your bullshit,
you understand me?

30:14.062 --> 30:15.897
I'm looking for your man.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.818
He took a kid, David,
and she is very important to me.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.612
I need to get her back.

30:24.197 --> 30:27.283
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.827
That right?

30:30.411 --> 30:32.580
You don't know
what I'm talking about, huh?

30:33.122 --> 30:34.040
Okay.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.799
The whole goddamn thing's about you.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.593
See, I know why you sent him.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.304
This is all about you, David.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.682
Hey...

30:52.600 --> 30:54.894
think of everybody
who died here, that blood...

30:55.436 --> 30:57.105
That blood that's on your hands.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.773
How about that?

30:59.357 --> 31:02.485
You know what that's about, David Do you?

31:03.069 --> 31:05.780
See, I know what your secret is, David.
I know all about it.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.616
Now, here's what you need to know.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.080
I swear to you,
if something happens to that kid,

31:14.163 --> 31:15.331
I'm gonna kill you.

32:35.995 --> 32:38.581
Are you gonna blackmail me?

32:39.791 --> 32:40.917
Don't do that.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.044
Don't you play stupid with me.

32:43.127 --> 32:47.215
For God's sake! You burst into my home,
you punch me in the face,

32:47.298 --> 32:51.511
you keep yelling about murders and...
and some man and then some girl,

32:51.594 --> 32:53.721
and I don't know
what the hell all this is!

32:54.180 --> 32:55.181
I don't!

32:57.976 --> 32:58.977
Please.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.355
I'm scared.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.233
Okay?

33:05.316 --> 33:08.820
You're... you're... you're terrifying.

33:08.903 --> 33:12.949
And this... this...
I guess this was always gonna happen,

33:13.032 --> 33:17.829
but I promise you that I don't know...
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.431
You know something, David?

33:38.474 --> 33:43.146
Russians, they, uh...
they paid for these photos. Then...

33:45.356 --> 33:50.611
But then somebody found out, and...
everybody involved, they got killed.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.406
Who could have done that?

33:54.991 --> 33:57.243
Maybe someone with power,
someone with pull, right?

33:57.952 --> 33:59.203
Someone with no mercy.

34:00.413 --> 34:04.167
Thing is, you sit there in front of me,
you say you got no idea who did it.

34:04.250 --> 34:08.171
But, see, here's the thing.
I think you know exactly who it is.

34:08.921 --> 34:09.922
Right?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.425
Right, David?

34:16.054 --> 34:21.851
No. No. No. No, they... they wouldn't.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.896
They did.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.397
Oh, God.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.363
How many dead?

34:37.033 --> 34:38.034
Too many.

34:39.035 --> 34:42.872
I swear to you, I am not part of this.

34:45.374 --> 34:49.170
I would never do... this.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.762
All right.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.619
I think it's time to call Mommy and Daddy.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.792
In the name of Jesus Christ...

35:29.460 --> 35:31.671
who suffered for you...

35:33.506 --> 35:37.927
in the name of the Holy Spirit,
who was poured out...

35:49.730 --> 35:51.941
And may your home be in Heaven...

35:55.486 --> 36:00.533
with God the Father and the Son and...

36:02.034 --> 36:05.204
and the Holy Spirit...

36:08.666 --> 36:10.418
And all the angels.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.838
And all the angels.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.491
-Hey.
-Dinah. Is everything okay?

36:42.575 --> 36:45.161
Yeah. You sounded a little strange
on the phone before.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.747
-I just thought I'd see how you are.
-Oh, I guess I must have.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.290
Um... it's nothing.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.210
I just, I watched the news,
and I got a little overwhelmed.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.127
Ah.

36:53.252 --> 36:56.547
Even I'm not immune
to a good old-fashioned panic attack.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.925
Well, doctors make
the worst patients, huh?

37:00.259 --> 37:02.720
-Oh. Are you gonna ask me in?
-Oh, of course. Come on in.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.272
Are you going somewhere?

37:13.356 --> 37:16.859
Yeah. Yeah, I thought
why stay here freaking out

37:16.943 --> 37:20.613
when I could go somewhere
and wait till this is all over?

37:22.156 --> 37:25.451
Got you. Makes sense.
I mean, I wish I could do the same.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.163
Do you

37:29.247 --> 37:31.582
No. No, you know what? You're right. I...

37:32.500 --> 37:33.501
Probably not.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.297
We've just got to play it out now, right?

37:39.715 --> 37:41.050
Tea?

37:41.133 --> 37:42.134
Sure.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.936
Uh, there was one thing.

37:55.189 --> 37:58.985
When I went to visit Castle
in the hospital, Russo called him.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.278
He wanted to gloat.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.074
And he said something funny.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.245
He said to Frank he was his own devil now.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.707
Yeah...

38:14.500 --> 38:16.127
Yeah, it, um...

38:16.210 --> 38:19.672
I mean, it struck me because it was the
same thing you said to me the other night.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.757
I'm very fond of a quote.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.137
Afraid I'm guilty of repeating myself.
I use it often with my patients.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.973
-And there I was thinking I was special.

38:31.684 --> 38:35.771
Irises! Peonies! Lilies! Roses!

38:35.855 --> 38:37.356
If it grows, I've got it!

38:37.440 --> 38:39.358
What'll it be, buddy

38:41.944 --> 38:42.945
I don't know.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.866
Something blue?

38:47.700 --> 38:49.201
Dutch irises. That's it.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.745
Right over here.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.413
Ten bucks.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.125
Keep it.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.544
Thank you, Mr. Blue!

38:59.086 --> 39:01.172
Now, that's my kind of customer.

39:01.964 --> 39:05.343
When we talked about, uh, Castle
and Russo the other night...

39:07.136 --> 39:08.262
men like that...

39:11.223 --> 39:12.767
what stayed with me is...

39:15.061 --> 39:16.979
"What kind of a woman lets them in?"

39:20.733 --> 39:21.734
Women like me.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.279
-You can't blame--
-I hate him, Krista.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.824
I hate him so goddamn much.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.081
Do you want to know another secret?

39:35.164 --> 39:37.249
But this really has to stay between us.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.378
Right after Russo escaped...

39:44.131 --> 39:48.052
I brought Castle back here
to find him and to kill him.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.472
I risked everything I'd worked for,
everything I stood for,

39:51.555 --> 39:54.141
because I hate him so much.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.602
I actively condoned a murder.

39:56.685 --> 40:00.856
Now, I am a smart, strong woman.
Why would I do something like that?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.485
Dinah, I don't know
if I have the answer to that.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.613
No, I wasn't expecting one.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.201
But I... I do wonder...

40:15.162 --> 40:17.873
these broken birds of yours,
your patients,

40:18.582 --> 40:20.126
have you ever saved one?

40:22.044 --> 40:23.587
I'd like to think so.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.214
But not your father.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.801
Excuse me?

40:31.679 --> 40:33.639
Terrible thing that happened to you.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.478
You investigated me?

40:39.562 --> 40:41.730
More of a background check.
Force of habit.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.776
It was a long time ago.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.861
Still.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.706
Can you excuse me a minute?

41:00.291 --> 41:01.292
Sure.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.924
I'll make the tea.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.097
Oh, my God.

45:25.180 --> 45:27.433
No, don't. Stay back. Stay back.

45:27.516 --> 45:28.350
No.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.787
Oh, my goodness. Oh, God.
