WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:06.297
STAN: Four, station-house thefts.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.509
Lieutenant Hunter has alerted us
to a rash of these.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.554
Contact him or me
if you're missing anything,

00:12.637 --> 00:13.888
or if you have any clues.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.474
Five, Lieutenant Goldblume asks,

00:16.558 --> 00:18.435
he doesn't want to take any more calls

00:18.518 --> 00:20.603
re: repairmen for his house.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.439
Six, new undercover.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.691
Belker is at Monty's Save Shop,

00:24.774 --> 00:27.527
vis-Ã -vis cash machine rip-offs

00:28.069 --> 00:29.279
across from there.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.369
Seven, uh,
Captain Furillo will be in today.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.455
We're expecting him at 0800 hours.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.460
Eight, no funeral arrangements
as of this hour on Joe Coffey.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.839
As many of you know, his mother
and his stepfather live in Florida.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.467
They've been notified,
and they're returning up here.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.595
Last, the Coffey investigation.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.513
Lieutenant Buntz is in charge

00:55.597 --> 00:58.892
and assigned with him are
Detectives LaRue and Washington,

00:58.975 --> 01:02.145
Morrison, Bursky, Vargas and McNeil.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.938
Plus, Division is helping out.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.107
Current status is as follows:

01:06.733 --> 01:11.071
no suspects in custody
and no eyewitnesses to the event.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.407
However, we are developing
promising forensics.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.868
A suspect and vehicle description

01:16.951 --> 01:19.913
and other relevant data
are on the board, everybody.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.164
Please apprise yourself.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.708
People...

01:25.752 --> 01:28.129
uh, whenever a cop killer is on the loose,

01:28.213 --> 01:31.257
and a good friend is gone,
things change for all of us.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.804
Just remember
that investigation points to the fact

01:35.887 --> 01:39.557
that this is a street robber
who was interrupted in the act.

01:39.974 --> 01:43.228
Let's not be getting paranoid
that somebody's out there stalking us.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.813
Just do your job.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.732
Remain responsible
as regards to the community,

01:48.566 --> 01:50.068
and let's get the guy.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.905
Be careful out there.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.200
(indistinct chatter)

01:57.283 --> 01:58.952
(melancholic music playing)

02:02.080 --> 02:02.914
Bates.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.083
Sergeant Bates? Lucy?

02:09.045 --> 02:12.173
Um, desk today. Okay, Lucy?

02:12.257 --> 02:15.301
Whatever they want. Whatever Buntz says.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.763
You need any time off,
you need anybody to talk to...

02:27.897 --> 02:29.691
-Welcome back, Captain.
-Thank you.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.693
Sorry the circumstances stink.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.987
-Any developments?
-It's a little slow.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.407
We got a stolen-vehicle report
matches Bates' van description.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.825
-No vehicle?
-Not yet.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.243
-Frank?
-Henry.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.911
-Glad to see you, friend.
-Thank you.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.996
(telephone rings)

02:43.079 --> 02:45.290
Oh, Lieutenant Hunter, on those thefts,

02:45.373 --> 02:47.083
we'll be wanting all our spare manpower.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.086
-Oh, of course. The Coffey matter.
-I'll help you, sir.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.463
I was thinking to keep an eye
on the khaki officers,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.591
since they control access
to the squad room.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.342
Good enterprise, Ballantine.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.261
You know, that Melvin in particular.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.221
He seems the flaky type.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.057
Damn!

03:03.141 --> 03:04.184
Sir?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.935
My Swiss army knife.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.604
Check your pockets, sir?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah, about 5'10".

03:09.480 --> 03:11.316
Caucasian, right.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.235
No, not a light-skinned
Puerto Rican, Caucasian!

03:14.319 --> 03:16.988
Blue kind of work shirt, white high-tops.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.574
Merril Martin?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.242
Come on, he ain't out of the joint yet.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.912
-MAN: Lieutenant Buntz? Line four.
-You better do better.

03:23.995 --> 03:24.829
Buntz.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.707
Lucy, it's policy. One I agree with.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.209
Gonna give you these names.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.294
Father Richardson's
in the chaplain's office.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.004
Very solid, very good man.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.591
And Dr. Gordon, by reputation anyway,
is top-notch.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.969
I believe he's the department's senior
staff psychologist.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.972
So I guess it's take your pick,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.349
Believe in God or not.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.143
Something like that.
Or you could talk to both of them.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.021
Captain, I got somebody
sounds like our man.

03:50.104 --> 03:53.316
White male, light hair, 5'10",
medium-to-slight build.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.193
According to my snitch, lives in his SRO.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.112
Guy's been knocking down liquor stores
up and down Van Buren.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.323
-Take LaRue and Washington.
-Yeah.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.911
Bastard!

04:07.830 --> 04:10.333
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:10.416 --> 04:12.502
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:12.585 --> 04:16.256
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:16.339 --> 04:18.007
(theme music playing)

05:28.411 --> 05:29.329
(door slam)

05:29.412 --> 05:30.580
Police! Freeze!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.417
(action music playing)

05:48.639 --> 05:50.975
Looks like you stepped in something,
chicky, huh?

05:51.059 --> 05:51.893
Come on!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.479
(grunting)

05:54.562 --> 05:56.689
(moaning)

05:58.107 --> 06:00.610
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Okay, okay, we got him, we got him.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.737
Hey, hey! You kill a cop, buddy, huh?

06:02.820 --> 06:04.906
-Is that your thing?
-What the hell you talking about?

06:04.989 --> 06:07.367
You're under arrest,
suspicion robbery and murder!

06:21.756 --> 06:25.134
(beeps)

06:42.068 --> 06:44.570
You sure you can't paint over there
where the machine is?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.115
No, no. That's all metal over there.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.450
It don't need paint, Mr. Gutbaum.
Be a dead giveaway.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.328
-The perp would get hinky.
-Hinky?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.080
Yeah, hinky, nervous, unpredictable,

06:54.163 --> 06:56.040
subject to departure from his usual M.O.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.252
Just go on your own business,
Mr. Gutbaum. Everything's okay.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.088
I can't help but being a little nervous.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.673
Don't worry about a thing, Mr. G.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.466
Anything goes down, I'm here.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.301
And I got the officer to help me out.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.053
(chuckles) Just kidding.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.638
Go away.

07:12.515 --> 07:16.436
What kind of code do you use
when you got to use the facilities?

07:16.519 --> 07:17.478
Huh?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.439
What I'm saying is I could cover for you.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.274
I don't need any help.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
You're not dealing
with untrained personnel here.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.320
I mean, I got college credits
in poli-science.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.364
-You study English, too?
-Yeah, so?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.117
How come you don't understand
when I tell you to take off?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.202
And I got a brown belt in karate, sir.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.871
That's terrific.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.957
Then I will shoot you if you don't leave
me the hell alone.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.168
Okay, okay, I get the message.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
Uh, 10-4!

07:48.968 --> 07:51.512
Got a customer for you in interrogation,
Miss Davenport.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.515
Dee Wilson,
prostitution and controlled substance.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.683
Thanks, Sergeant.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.691
Here, Rich Turner. Book him.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.527
Rob one, murder of a shopkeeper and a cop.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.113
-Do you want a P.D., sport?
-P.D. or a lawyer?

08:12.408 --> 08:14.076
-Is that him?
-Look familiar?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.246
I don't know. I think so, yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.248
Good. All right.
Let's move you away from him.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.458
We'll get you a lineup.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.420
Look, I'm gonna wash
this guy's hands a minute,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.047
make sure we get a clean print.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.300
Same with all the girls
that work on Jefferson.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.011
You check on Marla,
that got popped with me?

08:32.094 --> 08:34.180
She gonna walk with a $100 fine.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.973
Because she's paying off Judge Hardin?

08:36.057 --> 08:39.644
Paying off the judge,
the bailiff, the lawyer.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.188
They all getting something
off the working girl.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.106
Do you have any proof
of these allegations?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.399
Check it out.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.111
You go to the court office,
over the lunchtime.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.364
That's when he gets
the envelopes for the judge.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.740
The clerk's office.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.284
Next to Judge Hardin's courtroom?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.995
I don't know, wherever the bailiff's at.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.664
He's the one.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.916
If I'm saying the truth, can I get out?

09:02.583 --> 09:05.294
Possibly. I'll check into it.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.464
(panting)

09:08.548 --> 09:11.133
You see, with the laserscope,
we got to scrub you real good.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.553
-Aah! It's hot.
-Come on, soap down now, chick,

09:13.636 --> 09:15.263
because if you were in Mel's Smoke Shop

09:15.346 --> 09:16.806
and you left even a partial print,

09:16.889 --> 09:18.891
that laserscope
is gonna lift it off anything.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.144
-What, do you think I'm stupid, man?
-No, I don't think you're very polite.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.980
-That's what I think.
-It's hot! It hurts!

09:24.063 --> 09:25.731
Not half as much as the electric chair.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.067
Now why don't you get smart
and tell me your story, huh?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.653
Because we already got a cop
that puts you leaving the scene.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.072
And that gets you 80% strapped in already.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.700
-Leaving what scene?
-Mel's Smoke Shop, you diphead!

09:35.783 --> 09:37.702
-Come on, scrub!
-What you want me to tell you?

09:37.785 --> 09:40.246
I've never been in a smoke shop?
I've been in the smoke shop!

09:40.329 --> 09:42.290
-When, last night?
-No, not last night!

09:42.790 --> 09:44.250
(panting)

09:44.792 --> 09:46.210
Come on now, chick.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.338
Now we know that you didn't want
to shoot a cop, right?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.173
We know that he surprised you, right?

09:51.257 --> 09:54.302
I'm telling my lawyer. I'm telling him
about this washing crap!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.971
Her story's this: Brown's Law office

09:57.054 --> 09:59.765
told all their pros clients
not to come to them anymore.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.101
To go to the public defender. So they do.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.728
But then the pimp gets a call,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.980
telling him to drop money
through a mail slot

10:06.063 --> 10:07.773
in the law firm's building.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.360
Money arrives before noon,
girl gets off with a fine.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.322
If it checks out and she'll testify,
she walks.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.699
I'll talk to her about testimony.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.242
How are you feeling?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.202
A little wobbly. Good enough.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.120
NORMAN: Captain?

10:22.163 --> 10:24.749
Counselor, you have a suspect
in the Coffey shooting.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.876
-He's in interrogation.
-Thank you.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.920
Are we on top of this, Norman?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.798
You heard Bates ID the showup.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.717
Plus, the guy's given a partial statement.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.844
He says he's been in Mel's Smokes.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.597
Uh, conceivable
we may lose that as coerced,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.098
but the guy's stupid, Captain.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.350
I think we can nail him.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.143
We're trashing his place right now.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.063
I also got some people coming in
for lineups on the other robberies.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.190
Sounds good. Keep me apprised.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.149
Yeah.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.276
(clears throat)

10:52.360 --> 10:56.489
Joyce's hooker says Hardin's the judge,
and the lawyer's somebody in Brown's firm.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.575
Hardin sounds like a match.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.410
Not a light sentencer, but real uneven.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.287
Can we get access to his clerk's office?

11:03.371 --> 11:05.331
Sure, an administrative
judge would let us in.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.416
-Today?
-Give it a try.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.674
How's our Coffey suspect?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.259
As soon as his attorney's through,
we start the lineups.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.761
(inaudible) Fine.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.514
-Lieutenant?
-Yeah?

11:21.597 --> 11:22.890
When do you want me for lineup?

11:22.973 --> 11:26.102
Uh, about an hour,
after his lawyer's done with him.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.396
So how we doing on the case?

11:29.188 --> 11:32.024
Hey, we got an eyewitness ID, namely you.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.902
-How much more we need?
-Yeah, but besides me, we doing okay?

11:34.985 --> 11:36.362
Yeah, not bad.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.532
Like what?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.828
Like, uh? Like he's talking.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.205
Like we got witnesses for other lineups,
other jobs.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.791
-Good, because I don't think I can ID him.
-Hey.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.960
You already said it was him
when we brought him in.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.295
I know I did. So now I'm not so sure.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.507
Come on, now. You only saw him
for a couple of seconds.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.051
Now, uh, this showup was accidental,

11:59.135 --> 12:01.095
and when you see him in the lineup,
you'll know.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.847
Maybe. I don't think so.

12:02.930 --> 12:06.225
Now it's the same description. He hits
little stores, he whacks people out.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.269
-You got to come through.
-You want me to lie?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.521
Is that what you're saying?
I told you I am not sure!

12:10.604 --> 12:12.481
No, I don't want you to lie. I just, uh...

12:12.565 --> 12:15.025
(exhales) I just want to get the guy
that iced your partner.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.861
And I don't want to get the guy?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.405
You think I want to let the guy go
who killed Joe?

12:19.488 --> 12:20.865
I don't want him to walk.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.325
That's why I asked you.

12:23.784 --> 12:27.037
Why don't you come up with some stuff?
Why don't you come up with his high-tops?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.881
(indistinct conversations)

12:43.095 --> 12:44.722
-You bored?
-No!

12:44.805 --> 12:46.891
Because we got
a 419 in progress over here.

12:46.974 --> 12:47.892
A what?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.935
Broad in aisle two
just boosted a Crenshaw.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.437
-It's up under her garment.
-Her?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.609
Pregnant women thieve like bandits.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.821
-Hold it a minute, ma'am.
-You got a problem?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.865
-Hey, let go of me!
-Don't give me cause, ma'am.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.409
-Hey, manager!
-Under detention.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.828
-Let go of me!
-I got her, Mr. G.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.206
-Hey. Did you steal something, lady?
-No!

13:10.289 --> 13:12.374
Check the Crenshaws in aisle three, Mr. G.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.211
-The top one is missing.
-All right, all right.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.213
Let go of her.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.552
Do you have a melon under there, lady?

13:24.136 --> 13:27.556
If I do, it's certainly gonna be
a surprise to my old man,

13:27.640 --> 13:30.017
because that's not
what he planted six months ago!

13:30.768 --> 13:33.145
-Let's examine the facts, shall we?
-Are you crazy?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.855
You want a lawsuit on your hands?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.775
That's right!
A lawsuit for false harassment.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.488
Now, there is no melon bulge here.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.198
Now, am I right?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.327
I ought to call your agency.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.912
Look, it was a judgment call, Mr. G.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.248
The top melon was missing,
she emerges from the aisle.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.875
-What am I supposed to do?
-A judgment call.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.170
How long have you been doing this job?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.005
Five days, sir.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.967
A little less enthusiasm, okay?

14:05.177 --> 14:08.013
I was in a video arcade, you know,
playing the games.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.348
From when to when?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.892
I was loaded. I don't know.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.187
-Is that the extent of your alibi?
-What's wrong with it?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.356
Nothing, but it would help
if we could prove it.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.359
So go ask him. Find the manager.
Maybe he saw me.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.361
Do you know his name
or have his description?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.612
I don't know it, okay?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.823
Maybe I was in my room.
Maybe I was just loaded.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.700
Mr. Turner, I'm not asking for the world.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.953
But a degree of consistency
about your whereabouts would help.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.496
Yeah. Well, I don't know!

14:34.206 --> 14:35.207
(sighs)

14:36.000 --> 14:37.710
What about your statement to the police?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.086
You were in the smoke shop.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.005
I thought you said we'd get that tossed.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.548
I'm simply trying to clarify.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.301
So I'll cop to a couple of rip-offs!

14:45.384 --> 14:48.012
What do you want me to say,
something stupid like I killed a cop?

14:48.095 --> 14:50.264
No way in town, man! Not a chance!

14:54.435 --> 14:57.229
Miss Davenport? Lineup's ready.
We're gonna be running it

14:57.313 --> 14:59.315
-in two or three parts.
-Why is that?

14:59.398 --> 15:01.775
We're having trouble
rounding up a couple of witnesses.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.569
Your client's been a busy little beaver.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.737
And so have you.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.990
I understand you tortured
Mr. Turner with hot water.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.034
-Come on.
-Hmm.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.953
Your statement goes down
the drain with your water.

15:13.037 --> 15:13.996
Count on it.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.174
-(sighs) Sergeant Bates?
-Miss davenport.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.469
-I'm really sorry about Joe.
-Thank you.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.514
Lieutenant Buntz just informed me
what sounded like a hitch in the lineup.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.517
-I don't know anything about it.
-Something about other witnesses.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.354
I don't want to pressure you,
but I know the extra care you wanna

15:38.437 --> 15:40.648
-take in getting the right perpetrator.
-Correct.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.817
Would you be willing
to talk to me this far?

15:44.276 --> 15:47.071
Tell me, when you saw my client
in booking earlier,

15:47.154 --> 15:50.950
-was that accidental, or did Lt. Buntz--
-Accidental. Totally accidental.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.620
Aren't you afraid that seeing my client
being brought in

15:54.703 --> 15:57.206
might prejudice your ability
to be objective in a lineup?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.208
I don't want to discuss the case with you.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.751
Excuse me, Miss Davenport.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.294
They're looking for you in lineup.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.089
-Thank you, Sergeant.
-Right.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.384
Hey, don't let her get to you.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.510
About what?

16:09.593 --> 16:11.845
She was asking you
about what you saw, right?

16:11.929 --> 16:15.140
Wrong! Buttinsky.
Everybody has to butt in,

16:15.224 --> 16:17.226
tell me when to say something,
when not to say it,

16:17.309 --> 16:22.189
-when to go to lineup, do this, do that!
-NORMAN: Number three, step forward.

16:24.692 --> 16:25.776
Turn to your right.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.321
Turn to your left.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.700
All right, step back, number three.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.326
-That's him.
-Are you sure?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.371
-Positive.
-Okay, that's it.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.831
What about Bates?

16:40.499 --> 16:41.792
Uh, Captain.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.420
(clears throat)

16:50.092 --> 16:53.095
I've, uh, I've decided to let her
sit for a while, Captain.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.264
We got enough to hold
this yo-yo without her.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.599
And to tell you the truth,

16:57.683 --> 17:00.102
I think she could use a little more time
to think it over,

17:00.185 --> 17:01.979
get rid of any possible doubts.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.149
I wasn't aware she had any doubts.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.443
Well, you know, Captain, I mean...

17:07.526 --> 17:09.278
she's been through it, you know.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.280
She's a woman, you know.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.325
I mean, everybody has
doubts about something,

17:15.409 --> 17:17.244
which doesn't necessarily mean anything.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.245
It's just that,

17:18.328 --> 17:21.915
well, you can't be 100% sure
about anything in this world.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.709
See what I'm saying?

17:25.711 --> 17:29.173
(siren wails)

17:32.301 --> 17:33.302
Lucy?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.846
-Captain.
-What are you doing?

17:37.264 --> 17:40.017
Uh, just going through this stuff.
It's Turner's.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.436
Recognize anything?

17:42.519 --> 17:45.898
You know, all I saw
were those white high-tops

17:45.981 --> 17:48.233
and that blue jacket-shirt thing.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.070
Lieutenant Buntz says
you're not sure of your ID.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.031
It just keeps running around in my head.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.449
I think it's him.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.577
It probably is, but, you know?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.914
I keep thinking maybe, maybe I was wrong.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.124
Maybe there's a chance
that I made a mistake.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.252
-In that case--
-Like his eyes, you know, or his hair.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.670
It could have been longer.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.589
I just got that short look at him.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.133
He's coming out of the doors
about 30 feet away.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.927
It's just confusing. That's...

18:16.011 --> 18:18.097
Lucy, if you can place him at the site,

18:18.180 --> 18:19.723
it certainly would be a big help.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.642
But if you can't, you can't.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.019
Nobody wants you
to go any further with this

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
than you legitimately can go.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.107
I'm not so sure of that.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.566
Take it from me, Sergeant.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.364
-Yes, sir.
-With that understanding,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.366
I'd like you to take a look at him
in the lineup.

18:38.867 --> 18:39.993
Right.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.122
NORMAN: Number three, step forward.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.126
Turn to your right.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.048
Turn to your left.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.387
Face front.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.477
Sorry. I'm just not sure.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.982
Need me for anything else?

19:14.778 --> 19:16.363
(door slams)

19:16.446 --> 19:18.115
Are you planning on charging murder?

19:19.491 --> 19:22.244
You just stay tuned. The show ain't over.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.039
Stan, I'm taking Detective Swain.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.499
Probably be a couple hours.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.877
-Stan, put me on night tour, will you?
-Yeah.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.129
Till Coffey clears and further notice.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.506
Good fishing, Lieutenant?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.092
It's time to start using
barbed hooks, Sergeant.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.220
The EATer brigade lost an entire gross
of officer-in-charge forms

19:40.304 --> 19:41.889
-less than an hour ago.
-Oh?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.313
(mumbling)
Judas Priest, in-house kleptomaniac.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.607
(sniffling)

19:52.149 --> 19:53.984
Oh, sorry, Lucy.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.611
(clears throat) Sorry.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.154
(sobbing)

19:58.989 --> 19:59.823
(clears throat)

20:01.450 --> 20:03.327
I keep forgetting he's dead.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.078
(clears throat)

20:06.538 --> 20:08.165
I keep wanting to tell him things.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.545
Well, why don't you just keep telling him?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.298
Really, there's no harm.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.928
I guess that's what I'm doing.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.140
I keep hearing him telling me back,

20:25.849 --> 20:28.518
"Luce, don't get jammed up.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.980
Just do your job. Do the best you can."

20:33.482 --> 20:34.566
That's Joe.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.653
Sounds like him.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.617
Excuse me.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.665
(steps going upstairs)

20:53.335 --> 20:54.795
WOMAN: Is this Judge Reckamens?

20:54.878 --> 20:57.214
-MAN: It's 217, down the hall.
-WOMAN: Thanks.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.885
Yo, Ronnie, how's he hanging, man?

21:02.552 --> 21:04.596
Not too bad. What you got?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.933
Hey, he looks familiar.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.895
And a motion to declare
you ugly, Trousdale.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.773
Go back to PR. All of you.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.358
Pleasure doing business with you.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.567
(speaks Spanish)

21:25.033 --> 21:26.368
I have today's winners.

21:27.077 --> 21:31.581
Marla Anderson, Pam Boston,
and one Tiffany Brewer.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.874
All of them good.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.711
Thanks. Bye!

21:39.006 --> 21:40.799
Police. You're under arrest.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.262
Jesus.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.763
Hey, Henry Goldblume!

21:47.764 --> 21:48.807
You're under arrest.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.601
What you do? Get a job with <i>Candid Camera?</i>

21:52.644 --> 21:54.229
Man, you serious?

21:54.313 --> 21:57.399
Uh-huh. Bribery. Come on.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.362
(traffic noises)

22:05.866 --> 22:08.285
Renko, check the hot sheet
for that red Fiero.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.413
807-RJ6.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.415
(exhales)

22:13.498 --> 22:15.000
-No. Not even close.
-No?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.335
I said no.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.172
(sighs) I keep thinking we're supposed
to play poker with him.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.257
It's, like, caught halfway down my craw--

22:22.341 --> 22:24.885
Renko, I don't even want to talk about it.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.473
Daryl Ann cried all night long.

22:29.556 --> 22:33.101
I had to rock her in my arms
till she went to sleep.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.813
(indistinct chatter on radio)

22:36.897 --> 22:39.232
-I didn't sleep at all.
-Me neither.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.027
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Robbery in progress.</i>
<i>Units to 123 Dekker.</i>

22:42.110 --> 22:44.863
That's us, pal. 2202 in response.

22:44.946 --> 22:49.326
(siren wails)

22:50.827 --> 22:52.788
Get out the way, man.

22:53.663 --> 22:56.291
Get out of the way, pal!

23:05.509 --> 23:07.010
I'll take the back.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.655
Bobby Hill?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.532
Bobby Hill?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.750
Oh! Lord! Didn't you hear me call you?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.836
No! I must have been
in one of the apartments.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.879
-(door creaks)
-Did you hear that?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.798
He's here.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.258
(action music playing)

23:50.720 --> 23:52.264
-Freeze!
-Renko, don't!

23:53.974 --> 23:57.436
Stand up! Put your hands over your head!
Turn around toward that wall right now!

23:57.519 --> 23:59.146
I'm gonna tell you something, pal.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.897
This ain't the day to be robbing people.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.732
No lie. If it wasn't for my partner,

24:02.816 --> 24:04.985
you'd have been shot
four or five times already.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.074
OFFICER: Hey! Don't open that can!

24:11.158 --> 24:12.993
Don't drink that. Hey, I'm talking to you!

24:13.076 --> 24:15.245
-MAN: So what?
-OFFICER: It's against the law.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.414
-Come back here!
-MAN: Get out of my way right now.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.709
-I'm gonna knock you right on your can!
-OFFICER: You're asking for it buddy.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.170
-When I buy a beer--
-MAN: You get away from me!

24:23.253 --> 24:25.922
OFFICER: Eee-yah! Man down! Man down!

24:26.006 --> 24:28.258
Backup! Backup!

24:28.341 --> 24:31.928
All right, all right! That's enough.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.014
Just step away. Go on!

24:36.850 --> 24:39.686
Thanks, Mick. This here is
my commanding officer, you know.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.063
He was violating a PC 117.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.734
When I approached the subject
to request compliance, he became abusive.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.570
When I attempted to enforce the code,
he kicks me in the groin area.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.198
He came after me
with some of that kung fu stuff.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.200
-So I give him a little bazoo.
-Shh!

24:54.409 --> 24:56.286
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.497
All I did was try to defend myself.
That's all.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.082
Okay, okay! Take a hike.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.709
Okay.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.419
And stay out of trouble!

25:04.503 --> 25:05.712
What's going on here?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.214
I'm gonna tell you something.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.924
You have got a ticking bomb here.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.926
-Meaning what?
-I'm not talking to you!

25:11.009 --> 25:13.094
I did what you said.
You said to leave you alone.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.180
I went after the PC 117 myself.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.349
Okay, I underestimated
the violence potential.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.851
-I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
-I don't want you to take this

25:19.935 --> 25:22.854
the wrong way,
but have you ever stopped to think about,

25:22.938 --> 25:25.774
I don't know,
maybe going into some other line of work?

25:27.400 --> 25:30.695
You don't mean,
get out of law enforcement?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.156
-Yes!
-No, you don't understand.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.451
I have wanted to be a cop all my life.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.871
When I was a little kid, we used
to have these 211's going down,

25:39.955 --> 25:43.166
and this cop used to roll on his wheels
and kick the door down,

25:43.250 --> 25:46.836
and he'd pull my old man off my mom
and tell me everything was gonna be okay.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.130
And, you know, I thought that guy
was some kind of god.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.092
That's the most moronic thing
I've ever heard.

25:52.175 --> 25:55.345
-You're fired!
-Hold on, Mr. Gutbaum.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.055
Let's not go overboard. I wouldn't.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.139
I would!

25:58.223 --> 26:00.016
Listen.
I want you to go down to your agency

26:00.100 --> 26:02.269
and tell them to send me somebody normal.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.187
One of their ex-cons.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.067
You can't help me out
on this one, big guy?

26:14.739 --> 26:16.408
This is a code three, then, Mick.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.579
Okay, we got a van.
This look like the one?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.916
-Yeah.
-Good. It's in impound.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.626
-Go take a look at it.
-Okay.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.504
Buntz.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.590
Sorry about what happened before.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.925
You know I'd do anything
in the world to make this case.

26:34.759 --> 26:35.927
Just go on down, huh?

26:36.011 --> 26:37.804
SID is looking for prints already.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.517
Here's Roy Slay, robbery and assault.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.060
Stand right here!

26:44.853 --> 26:46.771
Mario Mangella, esquire.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.316
Retained on behalf
of Trousdale and Martinez.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.568
Martinez don't want you, Mr. Mangella.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.278
Well, I was informed that he did.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.530
Well, he don't.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.368
Brown sent a lawyer to me
to protect himself!

27:00.452 --> 27:02.912
-Not me!
-You want a public defender?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.081
I want Brown's butt here!

27:05.165 --> 27:07.959
Are you claiming you had no idea
there was anything in that envelope?

27:08.918 --> 27:10.170
No way, Frankie.

27:10.253 --> 27:14.466
Jesus, you can't be a lawyer
with a bribery conviction on your sheet.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.218
But right now you and the bailiff
are all we got.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.471
And he's not saying a thing, am I right?

27:20.472 --> 27:23.850
That's because Brown
has him all bottled up!

27:23.933 --> 27:27.479
You see? I would make a deal, but I can't!

27:28.730 --> 27:30.899
I don't know!

27:30.982 --> 27:33.151
Now doesn't that prove something?

27:33.234 --> 27:35.320
-Not really.
-(knocking on door)

27:35.403 --> 27:38.198
Captain?
Attorney Brown's in interrogation B.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.949
There! You got someplace now.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.202
Hang him out to dry!

27:43.328 --> 27:44.496
Get him a bail he can make.

27:44.579 --> 27:45.789
And a fast arraignment.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.123
Next bus.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.426
Aah!

27:58.510 --> 28:01.388
(alarm beeps)

28:01.471 --> 28:02.889
Leaping lizards!

28:02.972 --> 28:04.432
We got him!

28:04.516 --> 28:05.975
Okay, lock and load, men.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.482
-Yeah, Lieutenant?
-Yeah.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.318
We've been in every building
within three blocks of Mel's Smokes.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.945
I don't think there's a witness out there.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.447
It ain't gonna come off the neighborhood.
It's gonna come off the trade.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.449
Some guy who walked in
when the place was being robbed.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.493
-Okay, I'll be back at Turner's crib.
-Yeah.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.287
-Lieutenant, SID, line three.
-(exhales)

28:26.371 --> 28:30.959
(coughing)

28:32.711 --> 28:33.837
Ballantine!

28:35.630 --> 28:37.257
Call the paramedics, Britcher.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.761
So, we've caught the thief.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.723
You idiot!

28:47.142 --> 28:47.976
Ballantine.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.978
Don't Ballantine me!

28:50.603 --> 28:52.772
Your 21-blade Swiss army knife?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.442
Your 101st Airborne lighter? I've got it!

28:55.525 --> 28:57.902
Your Ayn Rand book, I got that, too,

28:57.986 --> 28:59.571
Lieutenant Hunter!

29:01.656 --> 29:03.867
-Why?
-Oh! Oh!

29:03.950 --> 29:07.036
Because I suppose
you've treated me like a son?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.456
You've treated me like a doormat!

29:09.539 --> 29:12.417
You've treated me
like that ridiculous dog of yours!

29:13.042 --> 29:15.795
Remember when you clawed me
and tied me up, Lieutenant?

29:15.879 --> 29:18.590
Mr. Great Russian Freedom Fighter!

29:18.673 --> 29:20.884
(panting)

29:20.967 --> 29:23.052
When your dog was painted
with zebra stripes,

29:23.136 --> 29:26.181
you know what I thought? Ha ha ha!

29:26.264 --> 29:28.767
Ha ha ha ha!

29:29.350 --> 29:31.811
I'm as disappointed
as you are, I'm sure, Captain.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.564
The kid had energy,
a kind of simian intelligence.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.484
-I thought some guts.
-Cut it, Mr. Brown.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.987
Cut what? Do you know
why I quit representing prostitutes?

29:41.070 --> 29:43.490
Precisely because of corruption.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.824
I can't afford corruption.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.826
My practice is too successful.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.704
Or do you mean that you can't afford
a close connection to it,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.123
so you shunt the girls off
to the public defender?

29:52.207 --> 29:54.209
Look, I can believe
that some people in my office

29:54.292 --> 29:56.503
have made phone calls, taken envelopes.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.797
But surely they don't need my cooperation.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.591
How can I help?
You can wire my office if you want.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.676
Martinez says you're the one.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.887
-What?
-Martinez.

30:06.679 --> 30:07.806
Martinez says it's you.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.182
I think it's him.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.560
If you don't have grounds
to hold me, people,

30:13.228 --> 30:15.188
I have a full afternoon in part 17.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.735
Don't make any mistakes, Mr. Brown.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.369
How about when you went out with that man?
That was good!

30:29.452 --> 30:32.247
And who stood up for you?
Who said he was beautiful?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.207
-I wanted to puke!
-Ballantine, come on.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.917
Ballantine, Ballantine!

30:36.000 --> 30:37.627
You don't even know my first name!

30:37.710 --> 30:39.337
Yes, of course I do. It's John.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.130
Everybody calls me Jack!

30:41.214 --> 30:42.715
Only you think of me as John

30:42.799 --> 30:45.510
because all you've called me for six years
is Ballantine!

30:45.593 --> 30:48.054
-Ballantine, that's not fair.
-The hell with you!

30:48.137 --> 30:49.806
The hell with the whole elite squad!

30:49.889 --> 30:52.267
Lieutenant, what's holding up
the lineups on Turner?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.519
Couple of witnesses
still being brought in.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.229
Move him to arraignment by 4:00 PM,

30:56.312 --> 30:58.189
or I'm bringing habeas corpus.

31:00.066 --> 31:02.235
Stan, I'm out to Mel's Smoke Shop.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.198
MAN: Maybe partial prints...

31:08.283 --> 31:11.327
Neal, maybe they should
reopen the smoke shop.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.414
Some of the regular, after-work customers
might come by.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.541
Yeah, we're gonna, Lucy.
Couple more hours.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.792
Yeah.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.796
Uh, deliveries? What about them?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.048
Nobody makes deliveries
6:00 at night, Luce.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.552
-Anything new?
-Uh, I'll check.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.304
They were gonna dust the shelves.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.683
-You IDed the van?
-Yeah, that's it.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.894
So now, uh, if we find a print

31:35.977 --> 31:37.937
on the steering wheel or something,
then we're in business.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.105
I hope so.

31:39.856 --> 31:44.110
Look, uh, maybe I came
down hard on you before.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.613
I know this whole situation
got to be a stone crusher.

31:47.196 --> 31:50.450
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go talk
to the department shrink,

31:50.533 --> 31:52.452
ask him if he knows a hypnotist.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.163
You know how they help you
re-create past scenes?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.167
Anyway, I'm on my way to Division.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.633
You know, driving to work this morning,
I hear

32:06.716 --> 32:08.426
one of them ads for real estate school.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.678
Usually I don't listen to them.
I just tune them out.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.640
But today, I was listening.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.475
You gonna go to real estate school, Renko?

32:15.558 --> 32:18.019
No, I didn't say I was gonna go,
I just said I was listening.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.646
How much money you think
you can make in real estate?

32:19.729 --> 32:23.274
-$60,000. $75,000. $100,000.
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>Vehicle eastbound on...</i>

32:23.358 --> 32:25.068
Hell, I'd listen, too.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.278
2202, corner of Bailey and 112th Street,

32:27.362 --> 32:28.529
will proceed to intercept.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.824
-(siren wails)
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>2202 to...</i>

32:31.908 --> 32:33.534
-(horn honks)
-Watch it, Renko!

32:34.369 --> 32:35.495
(tires screech)

32:42.835 --> 32:44.045
Freeze!

32:46.005 --> 32:47.840
All right, take it easy. I'm hurt.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.593
-I need an ambulance.
-It's just a head cut, fella.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.679
We'll swing by the emergency room, Renko.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.264
I don't feel sorry for you at all,
because you stole a car,

32:55.348 --> 32:57.183
and you don't even know
how to drive, do you?

32:57.266 --> 32:58.935
What the hell is this world coming to?

32:59.018 --> 33:02.271
You're under arrest for grand theft auto.
You have the right to remain silent.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.148
If you give up that right,
anything you say

33:04.232 --> 33:05.900
can and will be held against you.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.905
WOMAN: Prep an OR for a gunshot wound.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.741
If I can figure the guy's a possible
just hearing your description

33:13.825 --> 33:15.576
on the radio call,
how come you didn't see it?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.494
You got to realize

33:16.577 --> 33:18.788
we're under the impression
there was a suspect in custody.

33:18.871 --> 33:21.457
We got one suspect. A suspect.
That don't mean stop looking.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.418
We heard
Sergeant Bates had identified him.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.753
Where'd you hear it from?
Never heard it from me.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.131
-There was talk about it.
-So it was a rumor.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.633
You don't act on rumor.
That's not how things are done.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.221
All right, look.
So we all make mistakes, huh?

33:35.304 --> 33:37.390
The important thing
is we got another possible.

33:37.473 --> 33:40.643
Hey. Wachtel will sign a warrant.
We can swing by and pick it up.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.811
All right, let's go.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.568
I was gonna go to a hypnotist.

33:48.651 --> 33:49.944
So why'd you come to me?

33:50.945 --> 33:53.031
Well, I don't know.

33:53.114 --> 33:56.242
I heard going to a hypnotist

33:56.325 --> 33:58.411
can queer the evidence or...

33:59.245 --> 34:02.290
I don't know. I was down here, and I,

34:02.832 --> 34:05.334
I guess I just wanted somebody to

34:05.418 --> 34:07.545
tell me that he wasn't just dead and gone.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.964
If I told you something like that,
would you believe me?

34:11.424 --> 34:12.258
I'm not sure.

34:14.427 --> 34:19.807
Lucy, your partner Joe
enjoys an eternal life in Christ.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.062
It doesn't really change
anything, does it?

34:24.145 --> 34:27.565
Nor does it rid us
of grief or a sense of loss.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.025
No, no.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.820
Thanks, Father.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.409
You know, we've got this guy,

34:38.493 --> 34:40.119
and I really think that he killed Joe,

34:40.203 --> 34:42.288
but I wasn't a good cop.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.999
I didn't see what I should have seen
and now he's gonna get away.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.043
I don't know
if you were a good cop or not,

34:47.126 --> 34:50.463
but if I were you,
I wouldn't railroad anyone.

34:50.546 --> 34:54.550
My understanding is that there are times
to trust your heart

34:54.634 --> 34:57.136
and times to trust your eyes.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.681
Right.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.978
Hey, Sarge! You know
where Neal or Buntz are at?

35:06.062 --> 35:08.147
Uh-uh. Out someplace.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.858
-Hey, Luce, you got a second?
-What do you got?

35:10.942 --> 35:13.402
I just came from Turner's.
This stuff look familiar?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.364
Were they together? Did it look
like he could have worn it yesterday?

35:16.447 --> 35:19.283
We found it in a pillowcase he stuffed
in the back of a closet.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.703
Okay, thanks.

35:23.663 --> 35:24.831
Captain?

35:25.414 --> 35:26.958
I'd like to try the lineup again.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.253
I have to tell you, Luce, by now
its value as evidence is minimal.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.255
I know, but what else have we got?

35:32.338 --> 35:34.257
We have no gun, no other witness.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.384
Now I hear we don't even have
Buntz's statement.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.220
-Have you had a change of heart?
-I think so.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.931
Yes, I'd like to try.

35:42.014 --> 35:43.891
-All right, have Stan set it up.
-Okay.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.353
I did see some sneakers
from Turner's apartment.

35:47.436 --> 35:49.397
They mustn't influence you in the lineup.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.107
No. Right.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.861
What's going on?

35:54.944 --> 35:57.071
We're putting Turner
back in the lineup for Bates.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.991
-Oh, come on.
-We concede prior prejudicial effect.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.868
Do you concede Turner's being framed?

36:01.951 --> 36:04.912
A show-up ID followed by a failed lineup.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.249
Now a new lineup?
This is vigilante atmosphere, Captain.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.085
Sorry, but you're building
your little castle on sand.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.213
Mr. Turner is going to have
a very strong defense.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.136
William Hasselbach, GLA, suspicion murder.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.139
All right, Sergeant,
got a new candidate for you.

36:23.222 --> 36:26.350
Just tossed his apartment.
We found a cannon.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.104
That one look a little more like it?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.482
I don't know.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.235
(voice breaking) Okay, I don't know!

36:36.861 --> 36:38.029
I don't know!

36:44.035 --> 36:47.121
No lineup, okay? I was wrong.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.915
I almost nailed maybe the wrong guy.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.083
-Now they got another guy!
-Whom you recognize?

36:52.168 --> 36:54.378
Lucy, I won't allow you on another lineup.

36:54.462 --> 36:58.007
It was so quick. It was just--
I'm sorry, but--

36:58.090 --> 36:59.634
Captain, new suspect with a gun.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.094
We're sending for an 18B
and a rush on ballistics.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.721
MAN: DA on line 2.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.265
(telephone rings)

37:13.231 --> 37:14.690
MAN: I got two of these.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.069
WOMAN: Uh, that's $7.50.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.743
Is that gonna be cash or check?

37:25.826 --> 37:27.161
MAN: Uh, that's cash.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.392
MAN: Watch where you're going!

37:52.895 --> 37:55.773
Police officer!
You freeze or you're dog meat!

37:55.856 --> 37:58.693
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
-Move! Move!

37:58.776 --> 37:59.819
(shouting)

38:03.281 --> 38:04.198
Hey!

38:08.536 --> 38:09.578
Hey!

38:09.662 --> 38:12.039
(alarm ringing)

38:12.915 --> 38:13.791
Hey!

38:13.874 --> 38:16.836
(indistinct low-key outrage)

38:26.554 --> 38:29.765
(engine revving)

38:31.058 --> 38:33.436
(tires screech)

38:41.152 --> 38:43.154
Officer requesting assistance.

38:43.237 --> 38:46.032
Ambulance, uh, Dekker and Third.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.785
We got him! We got him, Mick!

38:50.286 --> 38:51.787
Are you crazy?

38:51.871 --> 38:53.998
Well, I seen you chasing him.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.583
So you ran him over and killed him?

38:55.666 --> 38:57.251
-He ain't dead.
-MAN: (groans)

38:57.335 --> 38:59.837
Just shook up a little.
I hit him just right, not too hard.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.506
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I come back to get my check,

39:02.590 --> 39:04.050
and I seen you chasing this guy.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.427
So I figured
maybe you could use a little help.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.889
He would have got away.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.016
Don't I at least get a thank you here?

39:12.099 --> 39:14.643
A thank you? A thank you?

39:15.186 --> 39:18.564
You're lucky I don't have you arrested
for attempted manslaughter!

39:18.647 --> 39:22.026
No way, Mick. It's a clear-cut PL 339C.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.987
Justifiable assistance to a peace officer.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.075
You know, I got canned at the agency.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.868
Oh, am I sorry to hear that?

39:30.951 --> 39:32.620
Hey, every knock's a boost. Am I right?

39:32.703 --> 39:33.913
You know what I'm gonna do?

39:33.996 --> 39:36.332
I'm gonna resubmit my application
to the department.

39:37.750 --> 39:38.959
The police department?

39:39.043 --> 39:42.922
Yeah. I figured
maybe you could give me a reference.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.633
(growls)

39:45.716 --> 39:49.428
Four detox programs for meth.
Seven arrests.

39:49.512 --> 39:53.182
-How many convictions?
-Oh, we're gonna add to that count, Billy.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.768
(laughs) You guys!

39:55.851 --> 39:57.603
Hey, hey, tell me.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.356
Which one of you plays the good guy,

40:00.439 --> 40:02.066
and who plays the bad guy?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.735
Aw, Billy knows how it works.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.112
Yeah, you know I do.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.783
It says here, uh... (clears throat)

40:10.866 --> 40:11.826
he wet his bed.

40:12.618 --> 40:14.578
They recommend rubber sheets.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.873
-(laughs)
-Oh, that's funny, man.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.668
All right, I want a lawyer.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.254
-I want the P.D.
-Oh, we're getting sensitive.

40:23.337 --> 40:27.383
You don't get the P.D.
She's representing the wrong suspect.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.802
-You get an 18B dude.
-What's that?

40:29.885 --> 40:33.389
Court-appointed shyster with nothing
to gain representing a loser like you.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.142
Hey, when you make a puddle,
do you sleep in it?

40:36.225 --> 40:38.060
-You shut up!
-Ah, ah!

40:38.144 --> 40:39.979
Now if you can't control yourself, girl,

40:40.062 --> 40:42.815
I'm gonna have to spank you
with a rolled-up newspaper.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.734
Where the hell's Brown?

40:45.818 --> 40:47.361
Huh? You let Brown go, man.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.405
We had no probable cause to hold him.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.323
What about him ruining my life?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.075
What about him lying?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.119
At least let me wear
a wire against the man.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.246
Jesus, you know he won't talk to you now.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.373
I know that? I know one thing.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.958
You should be ashamed of yourself.

41:01.041 --> 41:04.253
And you, Frankie. Shame on you pigs!

41:04.336 --> 41:07.006
Jesus, we're continuing the investigation.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.216
We're going after Judge Hardin
as well as Brown.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.178
If I thought you were totally innocent,
I'd tell you more.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.679
I don't need to know any more.

41:13.762 --> 41:17.308
Okay, Frankie? Come right down to it,

41:17.391 --> 41:19.643
the man has a bunch of little girls.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.646
Believe me! I will deal with Brown myself!

41:22.730 --> 41:23.856
(speaks Spanish)

41:25.149 --> 41:27.401
(telephone rings)

41:27.485 --> 41:29.778
SID fired Hasselbach's gun.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.822
It killed Officer Coffey.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.827
Tell us again what you did last night.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.414
You went to the mayor's ball,
you met Cinderella.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.667
Then the two of you must have gone
to the ladies' room.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.252
Enough already!

41:46.128 --> 41:47.588
You are wrong about me.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.257
I'm reading your sheet, little man.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.801
(door opens)

41:54.136 --> 41:56.639
Your gun killed our cop, Mr. Hasselbach.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.353
Let's get him arraigned.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.525
Come on, let's go.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.960
There you are, Ballantine.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.593
(sighs) You're looking much better.

42:37.429 --> 42:41.183
Ballan-- uh, Jack...

42:42.518 --> 42:43.852
no one knows better than I

42:43.936 --> 42:47.022
that emergency action
team duty exacts a toll.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.360
And I've decided that disciplinary action
is not appropriate.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.533
And on a more personal note...

43:00.160 --> 43:01.120
I forgive you.

43:01.203 --> 43:02.621
You forgive me?

43:02.705 --> 43:04.123
(laughs)

43:04.790 --> 43:07.793
You're the one who's been driving me crazy
in the first place!

43:08.919 --> 43:11.922
(laughs) Come on, Lieutenant! Come on.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.966
Give me about 3 1/2 hours

43:14.049 --> 43:17.011
on the zen stealth of the true ninja!

43:17.094 --> 43:19.805
(laughing) And then?

43:21.056 --> 43:23.350
Then they give warrior
of the month to Buntz!

43:23.434 --> 43:26.937
Norman Buntz! He's not even an EATer!

43:27.688 --> 43:31.233
That was a moment of true happiness
for me, Lieutenant!

43:31.317 --> 43:34.403
Classic projection
of your own inadequacies.

43:34.486 --> 43:38.198
It is the ritualistic betrayal and slaying
of the father figure.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.747
Father figure? You?

43:46.123 --> 43:48.375
I doubt you could sire a worm!

43:48.459 --> 43:49.793
Oh, Ballantine.

43:49.877 --> 43:53.672
It all fits. The endless preening,

43:53.756 --> 43:56.383
the incessant cleaning of the weapon.

43:56.467 --> 44:00.137
You talk tough, Lieutenant,
but you're a sick man!

44:01.639 --> 44:04.224
You have gone too far, Ballantine.
You're through.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.935
Through? We'll see who's through!

44:07.019 --> 44:09.855
You don't know
what it's been like keeping it all in

44:09.938 --> 44:12.941
while you've ignored me
and treated me like dirt!

44:13.525 --> 44:16.737
Well, now the real Jack Ballantine

44:16.820 --> 44:18.530
is out of the box.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.408
A cat ready to pounce!

44:21.492 --> 44:27.289
(hisses)

44:27.373 --> 44:29.625
There was arguing terrible.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.794
Lot of screaming and yelling.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.674
I knew something terrible
was gonna happen.

44:37.633 --> 44:38.884
You get a look at the other guy?

44:39.510 --> 44:42.429
No, but I heard Mr. Brown.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.889
He was screaming at him.

45:00.364 --> 45:04.034
Fabian, I feel like I brought you
into another lousy thing.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.036
What do you mean?

45:07.371 --> 45:09.206
You've had
so many hard things in your life,

45:09.289 --> 45:11.208
and now you got to deal with another one.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.584
Not this hard, Luce.

45:14.169 --> 45:15.337
You're not alone.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.591
You aren't either, Fabe.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.183
-(rock music on stereo)
-(laughing)

45:28.267 --> 45:30.352
RENKO: So, anyway,
we got this jumper, right?

45:30.436 --> 45:32.062
This old bird is real freaked out.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.357
The ledge is about this wide.
Old Coffey's inching up, and the guy says,

45:35.441 --> 45:38.152
"You grab me, I'll push you!"

45:38.235 --> 45:40.988
Old Coffey looks back at him
and says, "You grab me, I'll push you!"

45:41.071 --> 45:41.989
(laughing)

45:42.072 --> 45:44.700
In the meantime,
Renko's positioned the firemen.

45:44.783 --> 45:47.828
If there's gonna be a fall, they're gonna
be under Coffey and not the guy.

45:47.911 --> 45:50.414
And so,
Coffey finally talks him out of it.

45:50.497 --> 45:53.167
It takes about three hours.
He says, "I was in Vietnam, Danang,"

45:53.250 --> 45:54.251
all that good stuff.

45:54.334 --> 45:57.296
He finally gets the guy off,
and they take his picture for the paper.

45:57.379 --> 46:00.549
Next day, Briscoe gives a reprimand to him

46:00.632 --> 46:02.593
because he didn't have on his hat

46:02.676 --> 46:04.636
when he had the picture taken!

46:04.720 --> 46:08.307
Do you remember the time
we're in that hot-dog stand?

46:08.390 --> 46:12.144
Coffey is hitting
on this absolutely gorgeous chick.

46:12.227 --> 46:15.647
I'm talking grade-a primo carne, right?

46:15.731 --> 46:18.066
Now I'm sick
because he's doing pretty good.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.860
And a call comes in. (chuckles)

46:19.943 --> 46:21.779
It's a bank job in Coffey's sector.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.490
Coffey, he's acting
like a big man with the girl. You know.

46:24.573 --> 46:26.283
"We'll take care of this."

46:26.366 --> 46:27.910
That kind of attitude, you know?

46:27.993 --> 46:30.704
"Let me just swing into action here."

46:30.788 --> 46:32.873
So he's grabbing the broad's phone number

46:32.956 --> 46:35.375
while he's fishing around in his pockets
for his car keys.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.961
And then he realizes
that he left them in the ignition.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.380
(laughs) And he's locked out of his unit!

46:40.464 --> 46:41.715
(laughing)

46:41.799 --> 46:44.635
MAN: I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.

46:46.845 --> 46:50.682
I just heard about, uh,
your buddy getting killed,

46:50.766 --> 46:52.142
and I just wanted to, uh,

46:53.727 --> 46:55.687
express my condolences, you know?

46:55.771 --> 46:58.065
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

46:59.274 --> 47:00.984
Can I stand you folks to a round?

47:02.152 --> 47:04.196
No, thanks.

47:07.616 --> 47:10.369
(melancholic music playing)

47:13.330 --> 47:17.584
Yeah, I remember one bust
just after he came on the job.

47:17.668 --> 47:21.421
Coffey comes up to me.
I don't even know him.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.591
And he's all serious,
face all scrunched up.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.844
You know, like he used to get? (chuckles)

47:26.927 --> 47:30.556
And he tells me that I wrote up
my arrest report wrong.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.266
I'm thinking to myself, oh, my God,

47:32.349 --> 47:34.560
is this dude from Internal Affairs
or what?

47:35.227 --> 47:38.605
It turns out
that Neal spelled his name wrong.

47:38.689 --> 47:43.193
(chuckles) He said, "It's Coffey with a Y.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.612
Not like what yous drink."

47:49.825 --> 47:50.909
Yeah.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.160
(chuckles)

48:01.670 --> 48:03.672
(theme music playing)
