00:08.185 --> 00:09.486
Ron!

00:09.553 --> 00:10.787
Hello, Andy.

00:10.855 --> 00:12.822
It's quiet in here.
Where is everyone?

00:12.890 --> 00:14.491
The government has shut down.

00:14.558 --> 00:16.026
It's in every newspaper.

00:16.093 --> 00:17.050
How long is it gonna last?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.255
Well, if we're lucky,

00:18.323 --> 00:19.431
This building
will be empty for months.

00:19.499 --> 00:20.896
Wow.

00:20.964 --> 00:22.895
That is really bad timing.

00:22.963 --> 00:26.692
I just got this super-sweet-ass
rad crotch rocket.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.525
I've always
wanted one of these!

00:28.592 --> 00:31.192
But due to, you know,
never having a job,

00:31.260 --> 00:33.802
I couldn't afford it until now.

00:33.869 --> 00:35.969
Got a really good deal
on my lease.

00:36.039 --> 00:39.041
Paying like 12% interest.

00:39.109 --> 00:41.580
That's like one of the highest
you can get.

00:41.648 --> 00:42.717
Hey, so I've been
trying like crazy

00:42.785 --> 00:43.719
To get a hold of April.

00:43.787 --> 00:44.719
If you see her,
will you tell her

00:44.787 --> 00:45.718
I really need to talk to her?

00:45.786 --> 00:46.886
You got it.

00:46.953 --> 00:48.956
All right, thanks, Ron.

00:49.024 --> 00:49.959
Whuh-oh!

00:52.963 --> 00:54.498
Nailed it.

00:57.535 --> 01:06.510
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:14.655 --> 01:16.191
All I can tell you

01:16.258 --> 01:19.794
Is that all the parks
are closed until further notice.

01:21.564 --> 01:23.665
Look no one is more
upset about this than I am.

01:23.732 --> 01:25.666
Not like it's a competition
or anything,

01:25.734 --> 01:27.133
'cause if it was, I would win.

01:27.201 --> 01:28.501
But that's neither
here nor there.

01:28.569 --> 01:29.802
The point is, I would win.

01:29.870 --> 01:30.869
How long will they be closed?

01:30.937 --> 01:32.370
Could be forever.

01:32.438 --> 01:34.371
With the government shut down,
who's gonna stop Al Qaeda?

01:34.439 --> 01:36.373
One thing at a time.

01:36.441 --> 01:38.607
School is out in two weeks.

01:38.675 --> 01:40.676
What am I going to do
with my kids all day,

01:40.743 --> 01:42.109
Keep them in my house?

01:42.177 --> 01:43.544
Where I live?

01:43.612 --> 01:44.778
I don't know what to tell you.

01:44.846 --> 01:46.446
What about the kids concert
tomorrow

01:46.514 --> 01:47.681
At Ramsett park?

01:47.749 --> 01:49.617
The Freddy Spaghetti concert.

01:49.685 --> 01:52.220
Freddy Spaghetti
has been canceled.

01:53.556 --> 01:55.156
What? Jeez.

01:55.224 --> 01:56.591
Well, sit down and tell me

01:56.659 --> 01:57.793
Exactly what's happened.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.629
Well, every year
we kick off the summer

01:59.696 --> 02:01.197
With a children's concert
series,

02:01.264 --> 02:02.898
And this year,
the concert has been canceled

02:02.966 --> 02:04.300
Due to the shutdown.

02:04.367 --> 02:05.468
That's terrible.

02:05.536 --> 02:06.469
And we need to fix it.

02:06.536 --> 02:10.339
Oh! All right.
Great.

02:10.407 --> 02:11.707
I'm very glad that you
agree with me,

02:11.775 --> 02:13.309
But I actually worked
really hard on my argument.

02:13.376 --> 02:15.076
Is there any way
I can still kind of...

02:15.144 --> 02:16.077
- Oh, plea--
I'd love to hear it.

02:16.145 --> 02:17.145
Oh, good, thank you.

02:17.213 --> 02:18.880
"you're wrong.
Are you crazy?

02:18.948 --> 02:22.082
Can you put a price tag
on a child's smile?"

02:22.150 --> 02:23.083
Leslie Knope.

02:23.151 --> 02:24.351
What a surprise.

02:24.418 --> 02:26.486
The government has been
shut down for two days.

02:26.554 --> 02:29.056
And one city employee
has tried to schedule

02:29.123 --> 02:32.059
14 meetings with me.

02:32.127 --> 02:33.494
Can you guess who?

02:33.562 --> 02:35.162
Ben, there was a big concert?

02:35.230 --> 02:36.497
Now there's not?

02:36.565 --> 02:38.932
Isn't there anything
that we can do about that?

02:39.000 --> 02:39.933
No, there isn't.

02:40.001 --> 02:41.168
It's too bad.

02:41.235 --> 02:42.602
Sorry, Leslie. Damn!

02:42.670 --> 02:44.637
I have to go run ten miles.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.983 --> 02:58.051
Ben, let's talk solutions.

02:58.118 --> 03:00.086
Leslie, Pawnee is broke.

03:00.153 --> 03:02.054
There's no money
for a concert. Okay?

03:02.122 --> 03:05.223
I mean, Idaho cut
their parks department by 80%,

03:05.291 --> 03:08.226
And Idaho is basically
one giant park.

03:08.294 --> 03:09.794
- I've said it before
and I'll say it again, Ben--

03:09.862 --> 03:11.596
Pawnee is better than Idaho.

03:11.664 --> 03:13.365
No, Pawnee
is not special, okay?

03:13.433 --> 03:15.268
- Oh.
- Your department...

03:15.335 --> 03:17.036
All the way down here,

03:17.104 --> 03:18.871
Is not a priority.

03:18.939 --> 03:20.373
And, frankly, you're
not even supposed to be

03:20.441 --> 03:21.608
In the building, Leslie.

03:21.675 --> 03:22.742
You're non-essential.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.043
That is not your call.

03:24.111 --> 03:25.278
I know.
It's on your badge.

03:25.345 --> 03:27.847
This? This isn't me.

03:31.885 --> 03:33.485
Ann Perkins!

03:33.553 --> 03:35.320
Chris...Something.

03:35.388 --> 03:38.056
Hi! I was just doing my daily
lunchtime ten miles,

03:38.123 --> 03:39.223
And I ran by the hospital,

03:39.291 --> 03:40.791
And I thought I'd pop up
and say hi.

03:40.859 --> 03:42.626
Did you just start your run?

03:42.694 --> 03:43.661
No, I'm already at mile nine.

03:43.728 --> 03:45.129
But you're not sweating at all.

03:45.196 --> 03:46.797
- I know--I have
a resting heart rate

03:46.865 --> 03:48.298
Of 28 beats per minute.

03:48.366 --> 03:49.900
The scientist who studied me
said that my heart

03:49.968 --> 03:52.403
Could pump jet fuel
up into an airplane.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.605
I'd love to go out
on a date with you.

03:54.673 --> 03:56.640
I think you might
find me attractive,

03:56.708 --> 03:58.443
Because you got drunk
and kissed me when we first met.

03:58.510 --> 04:00.178
And, no pressure, but I do
have tonight open.

04:00.246 --> 04:02.480
I'm so sorry.
I'm really busy right now.

04:02.548 --> 04:06.751
No problem, I will
try again soon, Ann Perkins.

04:06.819 --> 04:08.920
That's the guy who likes you
that you're not into.

04:08.988 --> 04:10.989
Yeah.

04:11.057 --> 04:12.424
And which part of him
are you not looking at?

04:12.491 --> 04:13.592
Traditionally,

04:13.659 --> 04:15.294
When I end
a long-term relationship,

04:15.361 --> 04:16.862
I'm a little fragile.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.998
And I have a tendency to do
some reckless things.

04:20.065 --> 04:22.633
So I need
to stay away from Chris.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.969
I can't stand
this government shutdown!

04:25.037 --> 04:26.104
I can't stand
this budget crisis.

04:26.171 --> 04:27.472
<i>But what I can't stand</i>

04:27.539 --> 04:29.473
Is they're canceling
Freddy Spaghetti.

04:29.541 --> 04:30.808
You know everything.
What should I do about this?

04:30.876 --> 04:32.109
I don't know, Leslie.

04:32.176 --> 04:34.144
Why don't you see a movie
or go shopping or try--

04:34.212 --> 04:35.145
- Wait a minute,
what are you doing?

04:35.212 --> 04:36.179
What's happening?

04:36.247 --> 04:37.480
Um...

04:37.548 --> 04:39.649
You know, they offered me
a buyout, and I took it.

04:39.716 --> 04:43.218
And so now I work
for Norton construction.

04:46.523 --> 04:48.123
Sorry, I know I shouldn't
have done that.

04:48.191 --> 04:50.892
- That's okay.
- How could you quit?

04:50.960 --> 04:51.927
You know, not everyone

04:51.995 --> 04:53.962
Has your enthusiasm
for this work.

04:54.030 --> 04:56.398
You know, I guess I've been
mispronouncing your name

04:56.466 --> 04:58.467
All these years.

04:58.535 --> 05:00.636
Mark Brendana-quits.

05:00.703 --> 05:02.638
Recently, I had been
thinking about maybe,

05:02.706 --> 05:04.540
Um, leaving this job.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.408
But I felt like
I needed a sign.

05:06.476 --> 05:08.577
And then Ann broke up with me

05:08.645 --> 05:10.078
The week that I was going
to propose.

05:10.146 --> 05:11.880
The government got shut down,

05:11.948 --> 05:14.649
And yesterday...

05:14.717 --> 05:16.418
One of those pigeons
took a [bleep] on me.

05:16.485 --> 05:19.220
And I was indoors, so...

05:21.757 --> 05:23.224
What are you doing here?

05:23.291 --> 05:24.325
Hey, sorry.
I need your help.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.326
Is this a bad time?

05:25.394 --> 05:26.327
Lucy's here,

05:26.395 --> 05:27.728
I'm in my sexy pajamas,

05:27.796 --> 05:30.599
I just took four benadryls
to dull my sensitivity.

05:30.666 --> 05:32.568
Yes! It is a bad time.

05:32.635 --> 05:33.902
You're about to have sex.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.437
<i>Why else would boys 2 men's
on bended knee</i>

05:35.505 --> 05:36.639
Be playing right now?

05:36.707 --> 05:38.107
Okay, I just want to give you
a little advice,

05:38.175 --> 05:40.343
Which is don't make it last
really long.

05:40.411 --> 05:41.411
Ladies don't like that.

05:41.479 --> 05:42.513
- Okay, great.
- Okay?

05:42.580 --> 05:44.081
Wait, just one more thing.

05:44.149 --> 05:46.016
Are you using protection?

05:47.786 --> 05:49.920
You know?
I'm just gonna stay away

05:49.988 --> 05:51.255
From all guys right now.

05:51.323 --> 05:54.225
Yeah, less man time,
more Ann time.

05:54.293 --> 05:55.526
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:55.594 --> 05:57.628
The only guy
that I care about right now

05:57.696 --> 05:59.730
Is six feet tall with wild,
crazy hair

05:59.798 --> 06:03.434
And a ukulele that doubles
as a water gun.

06:03.502 --> 06:04.936
Freddy Spaghetti.
Oh.

06:05.003 --> 06:06.904
Children's concerts
aren't a priority these days.

06:06.972 --> 06:08.272
You know what is?
Sewage.

06:08.340 --> 06:12.644
Pawnee's kids are less important
than poop tubes.

06:12.711 --> 06:14.546
I don't know, I mean,
what are you gonna do?

06:14.613 --> 06:15.780
That's the way it is and--

06:15.848 --> 06:16.948
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

06:17.016 --> 06:18.450
If all the parks are closed,

06:18.518 --> 06:22.955
Why not just have the concert
in the lot behind my house?

06:23.023 --> 06:26.225
Ann, you devious bastard.

06:26.293 --> 06:27.726
♪ well, the cow goes moo ♪

06:27.794 --> 06:29.395
♪ and the pig goes oink ♪

06:29.462 --> 06:30.462
Well, I've spent
the last three hours

06:30.530 --> 06:31.830
Coming up with the plan.

06:31.898 --> 06:33.164
And I sent up the bat signal

06:33.232 --> 06:34.399
For all the people
in the parks department

06:34.467 --> 06:35.467
To come and join us.

06:35.534 --> 06:38.069
I told them to be here
by 8:00.

06:38.137 --> 06:39.971
Do you think anybody's
gonna show up?

06:40.039 --> 06:41.272
"a," yes.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.507
"b," even if they don't,

06:42.574 --> 06:43.975
We'll just put the concert
on ourselves.

06:44.043 --> 06:46.077
But, "c," yes, yes--they're
definitely gonna show up.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.479
Although, "d," maybe not.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.247
I think that you
need to prepare for

06:50.315 --> 06:52.016
The eventuality that no one--

06:52.084 --> 06:53.017
Hello?

06:53.085 --> 06:54.152
Ohh!

06:54.219 --> 06:56.321
God bless you, Jerry Gergich!

06:56.388 --> 06:57.589
Wow!

06:57.656 --> 06:58.756
Never thought I'd
hear those words from you.

06:58.824 --> 07:00.859
- Hey.
- April's here. Move, Jerry.

07:00.926 --> 07:02.161
April...

07:02.228 --> 07:04.129
I didn't think
you were gonna help.

07:04.197 --> 07:07.332
I still might not.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.700
Jerry, how do you feel
about lifting heavy things?

07:08.768 --> 07:11.102
- Ooh, my doctor just said
I should avoid--

07:11.170 --> 07:12.403
- Being a wuss?
Yes, I agree.

07:12.471 --> 07:14.205
So go out there and get
the equipment out of the truck.

07:14.272 --> 07:17.541
With current
and projected deficits,

07:17.609 --> 07:20.944
We need to cut expenditures
by 32%.

07:21.012 --> 07:22.545
Let's make it an even 40.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.013
Oh, that's not necessary.

07:24.081 --> 07:25.848
Slash it.
Slash it.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.518
I am an official member
of a task force

07:28.586 --> 07:31.555
Dedicated to slashing
the city budget.

07:31.623 --> 07:34.859
Just saying that
gave me a semi.

07:34.926 --> 07:36.027
Right off the bat,

07:36.095 --> 07:37.629
We sell city hall.

07:37.697 --> 07:40.198
Let somebody turn it
into a large gas station

07:40.266 --> 07:41.333
Or a TJ Maxx.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.035
Ron, that is a very creative
idea.

07:43.103 --> 07:45.037
But we don't want to sell
any of our major assets,

07:45.104 --> 07:46.105
Because we don't
want to lose out

07:46.172 --> 07:47.473
On any future revenue streams.

07:47.541 --> 07:48.707
I hear that.

07:48.775 --> 07:51.344
Don't worry, I have tons
more ideas.

07:51.411 --> 07:52.411
- Okay, uh--

07:54.547 --> 07:55.514
So sorry.

07:55.581 --> 07:57.348
New ringtone.

07:57.416 --> 07:58.549
Don't cut anything without me.

08:00.285 --> 08:01.452
Leslie?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.154
I don't care if you hate
what we do.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.555
I love it enough
for both of us.

08:04.623 --> 08:06.389
We're gonna put on
the Freddy Spaghetti concert,

08:06.457 --> 08:08.992
Today, 5:00, on lot 48.

08:09.060 --> 08:10.160
You can't do that.

08:10.227 --> 08:11.862
Watch me.
We're gonna do this, Ron.

08:11.930 --> 08:13.063
With or without you.

08:13.131 --> 08:15.031
Hammering away.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.133
Unh.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.080
Crank it.
Hit it.

08:20.147 --> 08:21.982
Needs 16 minutes
for premium bounce.

08:22.050 --> 08:24.551
Oh, hey, after this, can you
go pick up Freddy Spaghetti

08:24.619 --> 08:25.719
In your Mercedes?

08:25.786 --> 08:27.921
We need to give him
the star treatment.

08:27.989 --> 08:29.189
Hey, sorry we're late.

08:29.257 --> 08:30.424
I had to wait on my girlfriend

08:30.491 --> 08:31.425
To finish eating breakfast.

08:31.492 --> 08:32.926
Hi. I'm Lucy.

08:32.994 --> 08:34.193
Hi.

08:34.261 --> 08:35.229
We had dinner last night.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.565
And...Breakfast this morning.

08:37.631 --> 08:38.999
What were doing in between?

08:39.067 --> 08:40.601
Sex stuff.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.001
You guys know Tom really well,

08:42.070 --> 08:43.938
So I don't have to apologize
for his behavior, right?

08:44.005 --> 08:45.206
Right.

08:45.273 --> 08:46.340
The craziest thing is
it's like super loud.

08:46.408 --> 08:47.408
You know what I mean?

08:47.476 --> 08:49.210
I was on it for, like,
five minutes.

08:49.277 --> 08:50.511
I can't really hear anything.
Am I talking loud right now?

08:50.579 --> 08:51.879
- Yeah.
- April!

08:51.947 --> 08:53.781
Hey! Excuse me.

08:53.849 --> 08:54.815
I called you a gajillion times.

08:54.883 --> 08:55.850
Why didn't you call me back?

08:55.917 --> 08:56.951
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.120
I was too busy not wanting
to talk to you.

08:59.187 --> 09:00.855
- Huh?
- Jerry, what are you doing?

09:00.922 --> 09:02.857
Leslie asked me to post these
around the neighborhood.

09:02.925 --> 09:03.925
- I'll do it.
- Really? Wow.

09:03.993 --> 09:05.026
- Yes.
- Thanks.

09:05.094 --> 09:06.127
You want some help with that?

09:06.195 --> 09:08.262
Okay, let's talk about
parks and rec.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.064
This one's
a little complicated.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.500
I know what'll
loosen up our brains.

09:12.567 --> 09:13.567
A massage train.

09:13.635 --> 09:15.068
And I know
what you're thinking.

09:15.136 --> 09:17.138
It's not that I want a massage.
I'll be the caboose.

09:17.205 --> 09:20.808
And Ron Swanson
is the locomotive.

09:20.876 --> 09:22.877
And thanks to Ron,
the services budget

09:22.945 --> 09:24.045
Has already been
cut significantly.

09:24.112 --> 09:26.647
So seems like
the best option is job cuts.

09:26.715 --> 09:29.049
Starting with Leslie Knope.

09:29.117 --> 09:30.551
Ho ho.

09:30.618 --> 09:31.585
No, no, no, no, no.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.086
If you fire Leslie,

09:33.154 --> 09:35.222
You might as well just
get rid of the department.

09:35.290 --> 09:36.623
Look, I know how valuable
she is, believe me.

09:36.691 --> 09:38.625
But we've run out of options.

09:38.693 --> 09:39.926
There are plenty
of other options.

09:39.994 --> 09:43.330
For example,
sell the zoo animals.

09:43.398 --> 09:44.965
Okay, to whom?

09:45.033 --> 09:46.300
Cosmetics labs.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.935
Weird restaurants.

09:48.003 --> 09:49.503
I'm just spit-balling here.

09:49.571 --> 09:50.738
Okay, let's switch it up.

09:50.806 --> 09:51.939
Look, she makes
the second highest salary

09:52.007 --> 09:52.940
In the department.

09:53.008 --> 09:54.142
That will go a long way.

09:54.209 --> 09:57.078
I'm telling you,
it's just not an option.

09:57.146 --> 09:58.514
Come on.
Focus up, buddy.

09:58.581 --> 09:59.615
Give me a sec.

09:59.683 --> 10:00.649
Will you just stop
and listen to me?

10:00.717 --> 10:01.917
No.

10:01.985 --> 10:03.985
Fine, I don't want to talk
to you anyways.

10:04.053 --> 10:06.754
Reverse psychiatry.

10:06.822 --> 10:09.290
Fine.
What?

10:09.357 --> 10:12.026
I like you.

10:12.094 --> 10:14.528
In a, you know,

10:14.596 --> 10:16.297
Romantical kind of way.

10:16.364 --> 10:17.464
You do?

10:17.532 --> 10:19.233
Yes!

10:19.300 --> 10:22.269
Do you...

10:22.336 --> 10:23.269
Like me?

10:23.337 --> 10:24.270
Yes.

10:24.338 --> 10:25.638
Ha!

10:28.776 --> 10:31.579
So then...Perhaps

10:31.646 --> 10:33.581
Shall we go out this evening?

10:36.619 --> 10:37.619
No.

10:37.687 --> 10:40.288
Ahem.

10:40.356 --> 10:41.924
I don't think
we should see each other.

10:43.159 --> 10:44.692
Damn it.
Because you're 21

10:44.760 --> 10:45.860
And I'm 29?

10:45.928 --> 10:46.861
No.

10:46.929 --> 10:48.597
I don't care about that.

10:48.664 --> 10:50.365
It's because
whenever I see you talk to Ann

10:50.433 --> 10:52.334
Or talk about Ann,

10:52.401 --> 10:54.536
I feel like you still
have feelings for her.

10:54.603 --> 10:57.205
What? No, I don't.
But I don't.

10:57.273 --> 10:58.973
Really. I don't.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.441
Well, I think do.

11:00.509 --> 11:02.143
So...

11:02.211 --> 11:04.245
That's a problem for me.

11:09.018 --> 11:10.653
Because of my
libertarian beliefs,

11:10.720 --> 11:12.889
Leslie does 95% of the work.

11:12.957 --> 11:15.225
So you should lay me off.

11:15.293 --> 11:17.361
I'd be proud to be a casualty

11:17.428 --> 11:18.562
In this righteous war.

11:18.630 --> 11:19.564
It's precisely
because of your beliefs

11:19.631 --> 11:20.765
That we need to keep you.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.567
You would maintain
fiscal responsibility

11:22.635 --> 11:23.668
After we're gone.

11:23.736 --> 11:24.702
I strenuously object.

11:24.770 --> 11:26.337
Well, Ron, we're moving on.

11:26.405 --> 11:28.840
Every department's losing
a Leslie Knope.

11:28.908 --> 11:30.241
No, Ben, they are not.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.410
No other department
has one to begin with.

11:32.478 --> 11:34.712
Right now,
she's single-handedly

11:34.780 --> 11:36.214
Putting up some lousy concert

11:36.281 --> 11:38.516
For the city's kids.

11:38.584 --> 11:39.717
She's doing what?

11:39.785 --> 11:42.353
Could someone else
massage my shoulders?

11:42.421 --> 11:43.855
Wow, looking good.

11:43.923 --> 11:46.491
Yeah, I mean, I wish we'd
built one of those elevators

11:46.559 --> 11:48.527
That comes up
from under the stage.

11:48.594 --> 11:49.728
They're coming!

11:49.796 --> 11:51.729
They're coming.

11:51.797 --> 11:52.730
Oh!

11:52.798 --> 11:53.731
Uhh! They're coming.

11:53.799 --> 11:55.066
Who, the Russians?

11:55.134 --> 11:56.267
No, the state auditors.

11:56.335 --> 11:57.735
I accidentally told them
what you were doing

11:57.803 --> 12:00.037
In an attempt to save
some government jobs.

12:00.105 --> 12:02.106
It's been a very strange
day for me.

12:02.174 --> 12:03.708
Okay, everybody be cool.
Just be cool.

12:03.776 --> 12:04.709
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:04.777 --> 12:05.777
Hey, hey!
 hey.

12:05.844 --> 12:07.412
All right!
Everybody!

12:07.479 --> 12:09.180
Everybody, everybody.

12:09.248 --> 12:10.748
Hey, Ann Perkins, hi.

12:10.816 --> 12:12.350
- Hi.
- Everyone...

12:12.418 --> 12:13.952
You are all super amazing.

12:14.019 --> 12:16.253
You are what
makes Pawnee great,

12:16.321 --> 12:19.023
And I just want to tell you
that I am totally supportive

12:19.090 --> 12:21.458
Of your inspiring efforts
here today!

12:21.526 --> 12:22.859
That, we'll take.

12:22.927 --> 12:26.296
Yeah! Now my partner Ben
wants to say something.

12:26.364 --> 12:27.798
Yeah, we're shutting this down.

12:27.865 --> 12:28.932
Damn!

12:29.000 --> 12:30.367
That's terrible news.

12:30.434 --> 12:32.035
Surely there has to be
a solution, Ben.

12:32.103 --> 12:33.136
- No.
- Ben says no.

12:33.204 --> 12:34.237
I'm sorry, everyone.

12:34.305 --> 12:36.473
The concert is canceled,
everybody.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.807
Here's the thing, though, Ben.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.208
It's not canceled.
We're putting it on.

12:39.276 --> 12:40.743
Okay? Because the stage
is already built.

12:40.811 --> 12:43.712
Everything was donated
for free by local vendors.

12:43.780 --> 12:45.448
Everyone here believes
that what we're doing

12:45.516 --> 12:46.983
Is essential.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.086
Freddy Spaghetti will sing.

12:49.153 --> 12:51.222
Actually, Leslie,
I just found out...

12:51.289 --> 12:54.458
Freddy Spaghetti ain't comin'.

12:54.527 --> 12:57.162
Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.

12:57.230 --> 13:02.201
But something much cooler
is going to happen.

13:02.268 --> 13:04.169
I think. Ann.

13:07.706 --> 13:08.639
Okay.

13:08.707 --> 13:10.408
Good job.
You should hydrate.

13:12.844 --> 13:13.844
When we canceled on him,

13:13.912 --> 13:15.145
He took another gig
in Eagleton.

13:15.213 --> 13:17.147
At a library.

13:17.215 --> 13:18.381
Ohh!

13:18.449 --> 13:20.116
That's literally the worst place
I could imagine.

13:20.184 --> 13:22.085
Okay, guys, we're not
giving up on this.

13:22.152 --> 13:23.686
He's not the only musician
in town.

13:23.754 --> 13:25.288
Andy.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.523
I don't know, Leslie.

13:26.590 --> 13:27.524
I don't really
feel like playing right now.

13:27.591 --> 13:28.792
Andy, please.
Please, please, please.

13:28.859 --> 13:30.193
I don't even
have children's songs.

13:30.261 --> 13:32.062
<i>My last song I wrote
was called sex hair.</i>

13:32.129 --> 13:35.932
Well, just take the word sex
and change it to pickle.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.234
Pickle?

13:37.302 --> 13:39.703
♪ you've got pickle hair,
baby-hey ♪

13:39.771 --> 13:41.673
♪ and you got it from me ♪

13:41.740 --> 13:43.841
Still sounds like
it's about sex.

13:43.909 --> 13:45.042
I'm in. I gotta grab
my guitar from my house.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.611
I'll be back shortly.
Yeah!

13:46.678 --> 13:48.846
See, guys?
We have a solution.

13:48.914 --> 13:50.948
And the good news is,
there's always a solution

13:51.016 --> 13:53.317
If your motives are pure
and your cause is just.

13:53.385 --> 13:55.886
There's nothing...

13:55.954 --> 13:57.722
Oww, my arm!

14:00.401 --> 14:02.534
You have two broken bones
in your right arm,

14:02.602 --> 14:04.069
And four in your hand.

14:04.137 --> 14:06.138
That's the side that hurts.

14:06.206 --> 14:07.473
How soon until he's better?

14:07.541 --> 14:08.775
We'll set the fractures.

14:08.842 --> 14:10.911
I'd like to keep him overnight
for observation.

14:10.979 --> 14:12.279
Uh, is there any chance
you can fix me

14:12.347 --> 14:13.447
In the next ten minutes?

14:13.514 --> 14:14.748
Sure.

14:14.816 --> 14:16.716
I'll just advance
medical science 30 years.

14:16.784 --> 14:18.085
Great.

14:18.152 --> 14:19.420
Can mouse rat play without you?

14:19.487 --> 14:21.956
They tried once.
They're called rat mouse.

14:22.023 --> 14:23.291
And they're awful.

14:23.358 --> 14:26.227
But you have got to find
somebody.

14:26.295 --> 14:27.595
There's an old saying

14:27.663 --> 14:28.897
The show must go wrong.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.965
Everything always goes wrong,

14:31.033 --> 14:32.833
And you just
have to deal with it.

14:40.074 --> 14:41.741
Hello, Pawnee.

14:41.809 --> 14:44.477
I'm...Renata ricotta.

14:44.545 --> 14:47.980
Freddy Spaghetti
couldn't make it today.

14:48.048 --> 14:49.982
He bumped his noodle.

14:52.486 --> 14:54.587
There was sauce everywhere.

14:54.655 --> 14:56.522
It was just streaming
out of his face.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.192
It was really scary.

15:20.949 --> 15:22.617
All I know
is this guy showed up,

15:22.684 --> 15:24.452
Made me a much better offer.

Ron Corleone.

15:39.601 --> 15:42.903
This really attractive woman
is my girlfriend...Lucy.

15:42.971 --> 15:44.037
Hello, Lucy.

15:44.105 --> 15:45.472
- Hi.
- Whoa.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.573
Impressive handshake.

15:46.641 --> 15:47.774
Thanks.

15:47.842 --> 15:49.042
My father told me
that a limp handshake

15:49.110 --> 15:50.844
Was for weak men
and communists.

15:50.912 --> 15:51.912
He hated both.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.380
Well done, Tommy.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.748
Is that bacon
on your Turkey leg?

15:55.816 --> 15:57.951
They call it a Swanson.

16:00.321 --> 16:01.521
Wow.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.424
I brought you your favorite.

16:04.491 --> 16:05.858
Every color of jell-o.

16:05.926 --> 16:07.726
Oh ho ha ho ho!

16:07.794 --> 16:10.396
The jell-o rainbow.

16:10.464 --> 16:11.765
Thank you.

16:11.832 --> 16:13.933
Oh, injured Andy.

16:14.001 --> 16:16.035
It's kind of like
old times, huh?

16:16.103 --> 16:17.403
Yeah.

16:17.471 --> 16:19.305
- I almost expect you
to call me a-cakes.

16:20.474 --> 16:22.542
- "a-cakes."

16:22.609 --> 16:24.410
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

16:33.086 --> 16:35.187
Oh, my God, I'm...

16:35.255 --> 16:36.354
Ohh.

16:36.422 --> 16:37.789
- I'm so sorry.
- Ohh!

16:37.857 --> 16:38.790
- I should not--

16:38.858 --> 16:40.758
I--I'm sorry.

16:40.826 --> 16:42.594
That was...Not...

16:47.900 --> 16:48.900
♪ Spaghetti ♪

16:48.968 --> 16:50.368
Spaghetti!

16:50.435 --> 16:51.369
♪ fuseli ♪

16:51.436 --> 16:52.570
Fuseli!

16:52.638 --> 16:54.038
♪ egg noodles ♪

16:54.106 --> 16:55.073
Egg noodles!

16:55.140 --> 16:56.374
Why did you do this?

16:56.442 --> 16:58.242
Well, I'm not a monster.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.977
I want the kids
to have their concert.

17:00.045 --> 17:01.946
Ah, mean Ben has a soft spot.

17:02.014 --> 17:03.047
Is that what you guys call me?

17:03.115 --> 17:05.148
"mean Ben"?
No, no, no.

17:06.952 --> 17:09.119
Look, this
is really great today.

17:09.186 --> 17:10.621
But...

17:10.689 --> 17:12.388
There's gonna be
a lot of pain ahead, Leslie.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.425
We have to cut 32% of the--

17:14.492 --> 17:17.094
- Can you just stop it?
Okay?

17:17.162 --> 17:19.128
Just for one moment,
enjoy the fact

17:19.196 --> 17:21.231
That you provided
a service for people,

17:21.299 --> 17:22.665
Not a cut.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.300
A service.

17:24.368 --> 17:26.435
And they love it.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.904
Biggest service

17:27.972 --> 17:29.506
Was getting you
to stop singing.

17:34.677 --> 17:36.144
- Hey.
- April.

17:36.212 --> 17:38.080
I just heard.

17:38.148 --> 17:39.315
Are you okay?

17:39.383 --> 17:42.151
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

17:42.219 --> 17:44.787
Listen, what I said
this afternoon was...

17:44.854 --> 17:46.188
Stupid.

17:46.255 --> 17:47.356
Okay?

17:47.423 --> 17:49.091
I totally want
to go out with you.

17:49.159 --> 17:50.993
Good.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.194
I want to be with you.

18:03.239 --> 18:07.175
Ah.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.176
That was nice.

18:08.244 --> 18:09.944
- That--yeah.

18:11.614 --> 18:13.615
Here's just one thing,
real quick.

18:13.682 --> 18:14.615
I want to be totally
honest with you,

18:14.683 --> 18:16.284
Because I like you so much.

18:16.352 --> 18:17.618
But, like, two minutes ago,

18:17.686 --> 18:19.653
Me and Ann did kiss.

18:19.721 --> 18:21.522
- What?
- But here's--

18:21.589 --> 18:23.957
No, no, no.
Uh, it was crazy.

18:24.025 --> 18:25.392
She kissed me.

18:25.460 --> 18:26.726
- Okay, bye.
- Wait, where are you going?

18:26.794 --> 18:28.361
- Bye.
- No, no, no, no, no. Hey.

18:28.429 --> 18:30.763
April. April!
Bye.

18:34.268 --> 18:37.170
Dude, don't even think
about kissing me.

18:37.237 --> 18:39.038
And what was your
favorite song, Chelsea?

18:39.106 --> 18:40.306
<i>Penne and the jets.</i>

18:40.374 --> 18:41.541
Me too!

18:41.609 --> 18:42.909
Thank you all so much.

18:42.977 --> 18:46.213
With all the parks closed,
we've been going crazy.

18:46.281 --> 18:47.214
Oh, it's our pleasure.

18:47.282 --> 18:48.983
Come on.

18:49.051 --> 18:51.085
You guys are the best,

18:51.153 --> 18:52.120
Most important people,

18:52.188 --> 18:53.321
And the most important
government

18:53.389 --> 18:54.689
In the best city in the world.

18:54.757 --> 18:57.358
Suck it, Paris, France.

18:57.426 --> 19:00.728
Well, I would say
see you tomorrow, but...

19:00.795 --> 19:01.829
Great job.

19:01.896 --> 19:02.830
Good work, Leslie.

19:02.897 --> 19:04.498
- Bye.
- Bye, Leslie.

19:04.566 --> 19:06.066
See you soon, I hope.

19:19.145 --> 19:21.614
I liked this a lot better
when it was a pit.

19:22.882 --> 19:25.217
Is that weird?

19:25.285 --> 19:29.088
- I'm sorry I called you
mark Brendana-quits.

19:29.156 --> 19:31.157
Don't ever apologize to me.

19:31.225 --> 19:32.692
I'm serious.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.761
If--if everyone
in government were like you,

19:34.829 --> 19:36.596
Then I would probably
still work there.

19:36.664 --> 19:38.866
I got you a going away present.

19:38.933 --> 19:41.302
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

19:41.370 --> 19:42.470
Here.

19:42.538 --> 19:44.038
Red tape.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.674
So you'll never
forget your roots.

19:45.741 --> 19:47.409
- That's really nice of you.
- Yeah.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.444
Well, I have something
for you too.

19:49.512 --> 19:50.813
You do?

19:50.881 --> 19:53.048
I, um...

19:53.116 --> 19:54.416
Sort of threw together

19:54.484 --> 19:58.152
Some plans for a future park.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.321
I couldn't fit everything in
that you wanted,

20:00.389 --> 20:01.789
Like the roller coaster
or the shark tank,

20:01.857 --> 20:04.625
But I think it's
a pretty good start.

20:06.494 --> 20:07.427
Thank you.

20:07.495 --> 20:09.462
You're really welcome.

20:10.764 --> 20:14.767
But, you know,
Pawnee's bankrupt.

20:14.835 --> 20:18.237
I doubt I'll get to build
a park anytime soon.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.973
I wouldn't bet against you.

20:25.846 --> 20:27.714
See you around.
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.150 --> 20:35.153

20:36.098 --> 20:37.598
Morning.

20:37.666 --> 20:39.067
Hi. What are you
doing here?

20:39.135 --> 20:41.470
Ron made me the official
parks and rec representative

20:41.537 --> 20:43.138
For the budget discussions.

20:43.206 --> 20:45.575
- That's only supposed to be--
- Essential personnel?

20:45.642 --> 20:47.210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:47.278 --> 20:48.378
So shall we get started?

20:48.445 --> 20:50.547
I have so many ideas.

20:53.818 --> 20:55.086
Is this an autographed picture
of Jaime Foxx?

20:55.153 --> 20:57.488
Oh, there it is.
Thank God.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.790
- So how long
is this shut-down gonna last?

20:59.858 --> 21:00.924
No idea.

21:00.992 --> 21:02.960
I might have to get a temp job.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.428
Maybe I should start
working on my cologne line.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.866
- Uh-oh. Check it out.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.436
Whenever Ron has sex,
the next morning,

21:11.503 --> 21:14.973
He comes in dressed
like Tiger Woods.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.641
You all set?

21:16.708 --> 21:17.642
Oh, God.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.477
What?
Who is that?

21:20.746 --> 21:22.614
That is my ex-wife.
