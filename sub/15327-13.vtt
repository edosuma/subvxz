00:01.710 --> 00:04.796
- So Mom sent me a birthday
present from Mozambique.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.465
She says it symbolizes
feminine strength

00:07.549 --> 00:08.675
and made her think of me.

00:15.098 --> 00:18.560
- The resemblance is uncanny.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.813
Especially around the face area.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.773
- Sixteenth birthday.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.359
So exciting. Any idea what
you want to do on your big day?

00:26.443 --> 00:27.694
- Go out for Tepanyacki.

00:27.777 --> 00:28.528
- Really?

00:28.611 --> 00:29.821
- Yeah.
That's what we always do.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.156
- I love how they chop
the food up

00:31.239 --> 00:32.991
and cook it right in front
of you.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.076
- Are you sure
that's what you want to do,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.328
Gabby, for your 16th birthday?

00:37.412 --> 00:41.624
- And I was thinking this year
maybe Noah can join us?

00:41.708 --> 00:43.293
- But it's our family place.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.753
It's just for the five of us.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.296
And Grandma Maggie.

00:46.379 --> 00:49.466
And whatever two strangers
they put at our table.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.760
- Dad...

00:51.843 --> 00:54.053
- [sighs] Fine. He can come.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.556
But he sits on the end
with the strangers.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.726
- Aw... thanks, Dad.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.437
- Charlie!

01:02.520 --> 01:04.022
- What? I relented.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.233
- No, clearly she wants
a surprise party.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.861
- What? Where do you get
that out of Tepanyacki?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.821
- I got that out of "duh."

01:11.905 --> 01:16.159
Nobody wants some lame family
dinner for their sweet 16.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.369
- Hey, there's nothing lame
about yacki.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.371
- Yeah, it's
like a food tornado--

01:20.455 --> 01:22.874
meat and noodles flying
all over the place.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.667
- She can have that at home.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.878
I can make meat and noodles
fly around.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.505
- We know. We all remember

01:28.588 --> 01:30.673
the linguine-on-the-ceiling
incident.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.052
- That's how you test
if it's done.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.387
- [all] It's done.

01:40.433 --> 01:46.022

everyone screams "surprise!"

02:03.623 --> 02:06.876
{\an8}- Are you really explaining
surprise parties to me?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.044
{\an8}- I wasn't sure

02:08.127 --> 02:10.045
{\an8}you knew how they worked
since you never gave me one.

02:10.128 --> 02:14.634
{\an8}- Oh, here we go again!

02:14.717 --> 02:18.221
{\an8}I told you
why I never gave you one.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.349
{\an8}Because I was busy raising you.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.603
{\an8}And it's a stupid thing.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
{\an8}- Ah, it's not stupid. It's fun.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.316
{\an8}- Oh, it's a whole lot of hassle

02:30.400 --> 02:34.070
{\an8}for five seconds
of whoo-whoo-whoo.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.781
{\an8}Just tell her it's happening
and let her plan it with you.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.992
{\an8}- No, I am not going to deny
Gabby what you denied me.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.579
{\an8}I am going
to parent better than you did.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.582
{\an8}- Parent better than I did?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.668
- I'm just saying I've
gotten pretty good at this.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.587
- Well, then we are going
to do it your way--

02:50.670 --> 02:53.047
your better-parent way.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.758
- Thank you. Can I put you
down for hors d'oeuvres?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.719
- No.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.889
Tiny food makes
my hands look big.

03:02.223 --> 03:06.436
But I tell you what
I'll do the invitations.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.521
That way, Gabby won't see
them laying around.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.607
- Good thinking.
You do the invites.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.608
I'll handle the food.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.609
[door opens]

03:12.692 --> 03:13.735
- GABBY: Hey, I'm home.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.779
- Oh. She's supposed to be
at Molly's.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.406
- Hey, guys.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.491
You doing some kind
of retirement party?

03:20.575 --> 03:23.036
- No!

03:23.119 --> 03:24.787
Why would you say
retirement party?

03:24.871 --> 03:27.790
'Cause it's in a banquet hall
and there's a waffle station.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.792
- This doesn't sound
like a cool party?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
- Nothing I'd think was cool.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.922
- The waffles have on toppings.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.965
- My grandmother loves toppings.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.468
But not caramel
because her teeth come out.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.136
- Yeah. Remember
that time we gave

03:40.219 --> 03:41.596
her kettle corn and she was all,

03:41.679 --> 03:45.308
[affected accent] "This kettle
corn is just so delicious."

03:47.685 --> 03:48.728
- Did you hear that?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.814

to that grandmomma.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.155

a total brain melt

04:01.032 --> 04:03.493
Gabby will have
when she sees what we got her.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.749
This car only cost me 50 bucks.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.835
Plus another 50 to have
it brought here by flatbed.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.629
You know it's a quality vehicle

04:14.712 --> 04:16.505
when it's delivered on top
of another vehicle.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.343
And the best part,
Gabby will owe me.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.679
She'll have
to drive me anywhere I want.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.014
I got a business I want
to get off the ground.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.309
- Importing baby hippos.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.727
- Why would I do that?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.187
- Nobody else is doing it.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.189
We would own the hippo business.

04:33.272 --> 04:36.359
And also, perhaps, a hippo.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.863
- I was thinking left
over pizza delivery.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.200
And now I can't get your stupid
hippo thing out of my head.

04:44.283 --> 04:48.162

we're doing it.

Let's fire this baby up.

Wait.

I'm picking out
her birthday present.

You know Gabby better
than I'd like.

I've got three awesome choices

05:41.507 --> 05:43.926
but I need help
narrowing it down.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.845
- Here's number one.
- Is that a snow cone machine?

05:45.928 --> 05:48.431
- Hehe.
You know it.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.850
She loves her snow cones.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.977
- Yeah, once a year
at the carnival.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.897
That would be like getting her
a corndog maker.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.028
- So much for number two.
Here's number three.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.863
Gabby always wants shoes.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.866
- Not shoes that light up.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.953
- They'll keep her safe
at night.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.955
All right, fine.
What are you getting her?

06:13.039 --> 06:15.249
- Jar of dirt.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.293
- That's a band, right?

06:17.376 --> 06:21.214
- No. I dug up the spot where
we met and I put it in a jar.

06:21.297 --> 06:25.051
- Gabby told me you two met
at the gym.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.803

06:26.886 --> 06:30.389
Then who did I-- Oh, yeah.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.474
I'm gonna need
a whole knew gift.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.101

Not until you help

I was just talking
to your dad about...

06:41.567 --> 06:43.444
man issues.

- And that's when you know
it's time to shave your head.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.242
Maybe we'll take this
manly discussion, you know,

06:49.325 --> 06:50.409
out back.

I thought you were going to ask
your dad for a sweet 16 party.

feelings.

We've been doing Tepanyacki for
my birthday since I was five.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.675

This is 16.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.345
And I was going to use your
party to get my party.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.013
That's how
I get everything I have.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.641
That's how I got braces.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.852
- Sorry I never needed
reading glasses.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.311
- That's okay.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.981
Lot's of people
don't go to college.

If you did want a dream party
for your birthday,

what would it be like?

- My dream party?

07:29.782 --> 07:30.700

07:30.783 --> 07:32.118

07:32.201 --> 07:34.162
- Of course.
- With a DJ.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.164
- And maybe karaoke.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.291

with props so we can be all,

07:47.091 --> 07:48.384
You don't photobomb
in a photo booth.

07:48.467 --> 07:52.054
- Yeah, that's how Gina Brown
got a concussion.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.725

like, a dent.

What about mini chicken tacos?

guacamole and tiny salsa.

Now what are you going to do?

How?

No, back to why.

parent's job to find a solution.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.940
it would be a pretty sweet gift.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.942
I bet you can get an engine down
at the salvage yard

09:28.025 --> 09:29.026
and drop it right in.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.152

09:30.236 --> 09:31.445

I mean, if I could afford it,

09:34.907 --> 09:36.784
I'd even fix it up
so it was safe for her to drive.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.536
- I'm pretty handy
with a credit card.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.705
Maybe we can work together.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.833
- So wait.
We're giving Gabby a car?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.334
Like, you and me?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.044
- I think so.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.671
Of course, we'll have to keep it
on the low-low

09:48.754 --> 09:50.464
if we want
to make it part of the surprise.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.468
