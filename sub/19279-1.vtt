00:58.500 --> 01:01.002
- Junior.
- Yes, Mum?

01:01.170 --> 01:04.297
- Have you seen your father?
- Dad went to get water.

01:04.465 --> 01:08.343
Hey, wait for me! Pass it, come on!

01:08.510 --> 01:11.554
Come on! Quickly!

01:13.933 --> 01:16.017
Hmm?

01:16.185 --> 01:18.394
Hmm...

01:50.177 --> 01:53.137
Ha-ha-ha! Bet l scared you, right?

01:53.305 --> 01:55.473
Now tell the truth.

01:55.641 --> 01:58.142
The hairs on my neck
are all standing on end (!)

01:58.310 --> 02:00.229
Hmm...

02:01.314 --> 02:04.733
What was I supposed to do?

02:04.901 --> 02:06.735
I know!

02:06.903 --> 02:08.821
Yes! Yeah!

02:13.285 --> 02:16.203
All right...

02:20.083 --> 02:22.084
Oh!

02:22.252 --> 02:24.253
Oops!

02:24.421 --> 02:26.338
Hey-ho, Giselle.

02:26.506 --> 02:28.465
Hmm...men!

02:28.633 --> 02:31.593
- Did you see that?
- Yes, but what WAS that?

02:31.761 --> 02:35.472
Only hard-as-a-rock,
sun-dried hyena poo-poo.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.099
Oh, l see...

02:42.147 --> 02:43.605
Fini!

02:43.773 --> 02:47.192
Well...how do l look?

02:47.360 --> 02:49.445
Erm... Uh...

02:49.612 --> 02:53.073
Totally chic! Unbelievable!

02:53.241 --> 02:55.326
Darling, this is a work of art.

02:55.493 --> 02:59.413
I call it "Macaroni and Cheese".

02:59.581 --> 03:03.292
It would suit you too, Giselle.
A neck wax wouldn't hurt, either.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.044
No, thanks.

03:05.211 --> 03:07.254
Hmm...

03:07.422 --> 03:09.381
Mm-hmm...

03:09.549 --> 03:11.675
It's a matter of concentration.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.302
Yes, clearly.

03:13.470 --> 03:16.347
And the perfect wind conditions.

03:16.514 --> 03:18.599
Naturally.

03:27.692 --> 03:29.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:32.989 --> 03:35.282
Aw...

03:35.450 --> 03:37.117
Billy?

03:37.952 --> 03:39.661
Yoo-hoo, my turtle dove!

03:39.829 --> 03:44.249
- What are you doing?
- Hello, Bonnie. You look lovely.

03:44.417 --> 03:49.421
We're, erm... What are we doing?
Walking around, thinking, talking...

03:49.589 --> 03:51.799
Hitting hyena poo into a hole.

03:51.966 --> 03:55.928
That as well.
I was just going to tell you.

03:56.096 --> 04:00.683
You hit...hyena poo-poo...into a hole?

04:00.851 --> 04:04.396
- With a stick.
- Oh, with a stick!

04:04.563 --> 04:08.691
- Bingo.
- Interesting. And who thought that up?

04:08.859 --> 04:12.153
- Me! l thought that up.
- I thought so.

04:12.321 --> 04:14.697
What were you supposed
to do today, hmm?

04:14.865 --> 04:18.535
Supposed to do today, supposed to do...
Uh...Socrates, do you know?

04:18.702 --> 04:21.913
- You were to get water.
- Oh, that's right!

04:22.081 --> 04:24.249
Oh, Billy...

04:24.417 --> 04:28.420
I really think you are
and always will be a scatterbrain.

04:30.798 --> 04:33.049
But l sure love you.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.471
This is serious!

04:38.639 --> 04:42.725
Er...don't tell me.
You went to a beauty salon!

04:42.893 --> 04:46.604
- Hmm?
- It'll grow out. lt's a law of nature.

04:49.108 --> 04:52.735
- I didn't say a thing.
- Stop acting like such a fool!

04:52.903 --> 04:57.490
The water that flows down the mountain.
It should have got here by now!

04:58.909 --> 05:01.161
I'll play the water
down here with my drum.

05:01.328 --> 05:02.620
Mm?

06:19.115 --> 06:22.076
Many world politicians
and economic leaders

06:22.244 --> 06:25.704
have gathered
for the 167th Climate Conference.

06:25.872 --> 06:27.790
Here to the north they've all come,

06:27.958 --> 06:31.961
as these brave officials examine
the dramatic effects of global warming.

06:34.464 --> 06:36.507
Quick, the buffet's getting cold.

06:42.138 --> 06:45.266
Peter Cook reporting
from Thule, Greenland -

06:45.433 --> 06:47.768
the gateway to the Arctic.

07:01.449 --> 07:05.244
This was a wonderful day, Winifred.

07:05.412 --> 07:11.317
I've heard you say that
for exactly 714 years.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.672
- Know what?
- Of course I know.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.966
It's our wedding anniversary,

07:19.134 --> 07:23.178
and l wouldn't have wanted
to miss a single day.

07:43.825 --> 07:46.910
Captain! Sir, l believe
that we've run aground.

07:47.078 --> 07:49.413
Hmm, what? Run aground?

07:49.581 --> 07:53.667
Bah, something
is moving all-righty. Yes!

08:11.646 --> 08:14.522
My dear, the time has come

08:14.690 --> 08:17.859
for us to be getting
on our way once more.

08:30.164 --> 08:32.374
? l've been driving all night
My hands wet on the wheel

08:34.418 --> 08:39.255
? There's a voice in my head
That drives my heel

08:39.423 --> 08:43.842
? lt's my baby calling
Says, "l need you here"

08:44.010 --> 08:48.306
? And it's half past four
And l'm shifting gear

08:49.809 --> 08:54.479
? When she is lonely
And her longing gets too much

08:54.647 --> 08:59.067
? She sends a cable
Coming in from above

08:59.235 --> 09:01.528
? Don't need a phone at all

09:01.696 --> 09:05.532
? We've got a thing
That's called "radar love"

09:07.034 --> 09:09.536
? We've got a wave in the air

09:09.704 --> 09:11.579
? Radar love...?

09:13.249 --> 09:14.874
Oh, man!

09:38.274 --> 09:40.066
You know what, pal?

09:40.234 --> 09:43.403
Getting out
while the getting's good is good.

10:27.407 --> 10:29.116
AAH...

10:36.750 --> 10:39.418
Here's to you, jumping buddy.

11:10.659 --> 11:12.493
Hmm?

11:21.837 --> 11:23.921
My name's Toby. What do they call you?

11:27.843 --> 11:30.177
Tell you what,
I'm gonna call you Smiley!

11:43.942 --> 11:47.194
Oh, crikey! Strong stuff, mate!

11:48.864 --> 11:50.531
Cheers.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.910
You know, Smiley,
life's just too stressful here.

11:55.078 --> 11:58.623
How does an ocean cruise sound?
The high life on the high seas.

11:58.791 --> 12:01.877
You know, relax.
Just really stretch out.

12:03.045 --> 12:07.215
Good. Now smile.

12:07.383 --> 12:10.093
Soon,you'll be braising
in a choice Burgundy.

12:10.261 --> 12:13.471
You pathetic worm.

12:13.639 --> 12:15.849
Death to the tyrants!

12:19.687 --> 12:22.355
Now, look at what I've done -
I've forgotten the garlic.

12:24.066 --> 12:27.903
Don't run away, l'll be back soon.

12:36.704 --> 12:38.580
Ooh la la!

12:41.167 --> 12:42.792
Huh!

12:46.881 --> 12:49.591
It's liberty or death!

12:49.759 --> 12:51.843
Vive la France...

12:58.309 --> 13:00.435
Adieu!

13:02.104 --> 13:03.980
A chicken?

13:04.148 --> 13:09.486
Hello and welcome.
My name is Winifred.

13:09.654 --> 13:12.572
- And l, Winston.
- The name's Toby.

13:12.740 --> 13:17.535
Charles. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

13:23.876 --> 13:28.630
- With whom do l have the honneur?
- This is my friend Smiley.

13:28.798 --> 13:31.424
Things got a little bit steamy
back in the bush,

13:31.592 --> 13:35.220
so we thought we'd take ourselves
on a holiday to cool off.

13:35.388 --> 13:39.432
First it was just me and Smiley,
but then old Sushi climbed aboard.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.186
- Euh, Sushi...?
- That's my name.

13:44.939 --> 13:49.693
Yes. Well, then, carry on,
my fearless marsupial.

13:49.860 --> 13:55.365
And then, four weeks out to sea,
we met the tortoises,

13:55.533 --> 13:57.618
and since then we've had a plan.

13:57.786 --> 14:00.246
Ah, a plan is good.

14:00.414 --> 14:02.081
Euh, what plan?

14:02.249 --> 14:07.503
The migratory birds who used to visit us
on our island in the summer

14:07.671 --> 14:10.381
told us of a paradise of wonder.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.550
Far away from mankind.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.386
Ah, oui, a charming idea.

14:15.554 --> 14:20.391
What a stroke of luck
that you 'ave met me. l will lead you!

14:22.394 --> 14:25.146
? La mer

14:25.313 --> 14:27.398
? Les a bercés

14:28.650 --> 14:31.485
? Le long des golfes clairs

14:33.196 --> 14:35.906
? Et d'une chanson d'amour

14:36.074 --> 14:38.451
? La mer

14:38.618 --> 14:40.953
? A bercé mon coeur

14:41.121 --> 14:43.664
? Pour la vie... ?

14:46.376 --> 14:51.005
Our supplies are just about gone.
The water holes are running dry.

14:51.173 --> 14:54.550
Now that you mention it,
my throat does feel rather dry.

14:56.136 --> 14:58.429
Oh, without water we're lost!

14:58.597 --> 15:00.556
And without water we'll die!

15:00.724 --> 15:04.226
My stress levels are through the roof.
I'm having an anxiety attack!

15:04.394 --> 15:07.104
I'll shut up.

15:07.272 --> 15:10.066
Well, l'll just consult with the oracle.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.611
An oracle consult? This could be good!

15:34.007 --> 15:36.300
O mighty oracle.

15:36.468 --> 15:41.430
We humbly seek your advice in this time
of great fear and uncertainty.

15:41.598 --> 15:45.101
Tell us, when will the water come?

15:45.268 --> 15:49.814
I would advise you now, more than ever,
to keep the oracle in good humour.

15:50.482 --> 15:53.275
Aw...

15:53.443 --> 15:56.237
That tree trunk just ate
our last bunch of bananas.

15:56.404 --> 16:01.159
Harrumph. The water will come...
when it comes, l suppose.

16:01.327 --> 16:06.540
- The water's coming?
- The cup falls down the well until it breaks.

16:06.707 --> 16:09.084
What in the world
is that supposed to mean?

16:09.252 --> 16:12.254
Please, Billy,
you're insulting the oracle!

16:12.421 --> 16:15.006
If the water doesn't come,
we have to find it!

16:15.174 --> 16:18.426
Not stand here talking to a dried-up tree!

16:18.594 --> 16:21.847
Did you just call me a dried-up tree?

16:22.014 --> 16:25.642
That guy has got some nerve! Loser!

16:25.810 --> 16:30.021
You offended the oracle!
It won't speak to us any more.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.440
That was slick, loser!

16:32.608 --> 16:34.651
Hey! My dad's no loser!

16:34.819 --> 16:36.611
Humph!

16:36.779 --> 16:38.655
Comrades.

16:38.823 --> 16:44.703
Each one of us 'as tragically lost
their 'ome, their friends, their family!

16:44.871 --> 16:46.955
Stolen from under our noses!

16:47.123 --> 16:50.792
And now, comrades,
we will find ourselves a new place to live.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.878
One where there is no place for man.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.462
Blaah!

16:54.630 --> 16:57.174
Spoken with conviction.

16:58.968 --> 17:01.011
Heads up, folks!

17:03.222 --> 17:05.640
Now, that's some stress hormone.

17:08.019 --> 17:12.897
We 'ave all crossed the Seven Seas
in nothing more than a rusty bathtub.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.567
We 'ave weathered
the most terrible storms...

17:15.734 --> 17:18.653
... and evil of winds.

17:20.615 --> 17:24.492
We are so close to our goal! Allons!

17:24.660 --> 17:26.744
Raaaah!

17:28.455 --> 17:31.333
? You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

17:31.500 --> 17:35.295
? You put your right foot in
And you shake it all about

17:35.463 --> 17:39.090
? You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around

17:39.258 --> 17:42.344
? That's what it's all about

17:42.511 --> 17:44.429
? You put your left foot in...

17:44.597 --> 17:47.933
Euh! Beyond those rocks,
my friends, lies paradise.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.811
We are now ever so close
to reaching our goal!

17:51.979 --> 17:54.314
? You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around

17:54.482 --> 17:57.068
? That's what it's all about ?

17:58.195 --> 18:00.738
My dad is the best dad in the world.

18:00.906 --> 18:03.115
He is gonna bring us water
from the water hole!

18:03.283 --> 18:07.078
He'll fight the rhinos, kick the buffalo
and chase away the elephants.

18:07.246 --> 18:09.872
Whoa, dream on!

18:10.040 --> 18:13.709
- Your dad's a zero. Get real!
- Hmm?

18:13.877 --> 18:17.046
- And not to mention...
- Mention what?

18:17.214 --> 18:19.090
Hmm?

18:19.258 --> 18:21.884
All other meerkats have
a light coat except for him.

18:22.052 --> 18:25.096
I guess my dad's just one of a kind!

18:25.264 --> 18:29.016
Note to self: Get water.
Piece of cake.

18:29.184 --> 18:32.728
First shoo the buffalo away,
then fight off the rhinos

18:32.896 --> 18:35.356
and then stop the elephants
from drinking us dry!

18:35.524 --> 18:37.608
Hey, Billy! Psst!

18:38.652 --> 18:43.322
If you let them drink first and leave
the water hole in a good mood, it's safer.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.659
Giselle! Please, don't panic.

18:46.827 --> 18:51.163
Just take a good look at that idiot squad.
Zero intelligence.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.500
If they were any more clueless,
their heads would explode!

18:54.668 --> 18:55.960
Really?

18:59.673 --> 19:01.757
Chino wants a drink.

19:01.925 --> 19:04.385
And Chino's gonna have a drink.

19:04.553 --> 19:07.263
Boys, let's have a drink.

19:11.476 --> 19:15.730
Hey, I didn't hear anyone say
you could have the first drink!

19:15.897 --> 19:18.065
You talking to me?

19:18.233 --> 19:21.819
Are YOU talking to ME...unicorn?

19:21.987 --> 19:24.697
Did that guy just call me a unicorn?

19:27.117 --> 19:32.079
One sip and I'll be watching the buzzards
pick your bones in the blinding sun.

19:32.247 --> 19:35.958
- Chino drinks when he wants to, si?
- Oh, yeah?

19:36.126 --> 19:38.919
Then just try it and you'll see!

19:39.087 --> 19:41.797
Yeah, in your dreams, pizza-face!

20:00.735 --> 20:02.778
Afternoon!

20:02.945 --> 20:06.656
Cannonball!

20:09.994 --> 20:11.203
Hmm...?

20:16.376 --> 20:18.460
OK...

20:18.628 --> 20:22.422
What's a hundred tons of raw meat
compared to a little natural charm?

20:22.590 --> 20:27.177
Of a meek, weak, cheeky...

20:27.345 --> 20:29.429
..little freak.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.684
Stay calm and smile.

20:35.895 --> 20:38.897
Big toothy grin...

20:39.065 --> 20:41.316
Distract them.

20:41.484 --> 20:43.110
Hey, look over there!

20:44.612 --> 20:47.656
And discreetly fill the...

20:47.824 --> 20:50.826
And a little more for Daddy.

21:01.546 --> 21:04.464
You've got a problem, huh?
Carrot top?

21:04.632 --> 21:06.550
Carrot top!

21:06.717 --> 21:08.885
Hey, who's talking to you, lightweight?

21:17.103 --> 21:19.521
Whoa!

21:26.863 --> 21:29.448
Yaah-hoo!

21:37.582 --> 21:39.291
My dad!

21:50.136 --> 21:52.220
Junior!

21:57.895 --> 22:00.146
You sure showed those buffalo, Dad!

22:11.408 --> 22:14.494
So, l sure showed all of them!

22:14.661 --> 22:18.623
That big.
They were all that big, with hats!

22:22.669 --> 22:25.505
Stop right here! Not another step...

22:29.510 --> 22:31.260
Oh, Billy.

22:32.262 --> 22:35.431
Hey, everything's under control,
my turtle dove.

22:35.641 --> 22:37.683
Ha-ha!

22:37.851 --> 22:40.394
And l've got the water.

22:43.065 --> 22:44.690
Uh, well...

22:44.858 --> 22:46.859
Oh, Billy...

22:47.027 --> 22:48.903
Let's recap.

22:49.071 --> 22:53.491
Dad was supposed to chase away
the buffalo and get water...super (!)

22:56.036 --> 22:59.455
I told them all you were going
to get the water for us.

22:59.623 --> 23:00.998
Uh... Aw...

23:02.918 --> 23:04.752
Junior, wait a minute.

23:12.970 --> 23:15.555
Our supplies are just about gone.

23:15.722 --> 23:19.934
- It's OK, l'll work it all out.
- Billy...

23:21.395 --> 23:23.479
You're such a dreamer.

23:24.690 --> 23:26.691
What will happen to us?

23:26.858 --> 23:31.070
I promise, this time
I'm not gonna let you down.

23:38.412 --> 23:41.205
Hey, Junior, there's your old man.

23:41.373 --> 23:43.499
The rhino whisperer.

23:50.257 --> 23:53.342
- Erm, hello, my son.
- Yes, what is it?

23:53.510 --> 23:56.763
I just wanted to let you know
that I promised your mother...

23:56.931 --> 24:00.851
I've heard it before! You're always
making promises you can't keep!

24:01.019 --> 24:06.023
Go and hang out with your lion,
or go off and play your drum,

24:06.190 --> 24:08.859
or go off and hit
some hyena poo-poo into a hole.

24:11.904 --> 24:14.573
You're not my father any more.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.125
Billy!

24:40.308 --> 24:44.603
- You shouldn't have said that.
- Leave me alone!

24:53.905 --> 24:55.989
Socrates, we're needed.

24:56.157 --> 25:00.077
The very fate of Okavango
is right in our hands.

25:00.244 --> 25:02.537
What kind of plant
have you been chewing?

25:02.705 --> 25:05.499
Think, and compare us to eternity.

25:05.667 --> 25:08.377
We're grains of sand and that's all.

25:08.544 --> 25:13.090
I'm not a grain of sand, buddy,
I'm a meerkat! My family needs water!

25:13.257 --> 25:16.343
My son thinks I'm a big loser -
that's what's real.

25:16.511 --> 25:19.221
And now my reality
is to go and find water.

25:19.389 --> 25:21.682
And you're coming with me!

25:21.849 --> 25:26.478
That is the stuff
of a wonderful, tragic ballad.

25:26.646 --> 25:29.356
The sweet, yet sorrowful song
of Billy the Meerkat,

25:29.524 --> 25:31.441
who set out in search of water...

25:31.609 --> 25:35.195
I can hear it! l can just hear it!
Yeah, that's my song!

25:35.363 --> 25:38.073
- Alas, never to be seen again.
- Uh?

25:38.241 --> 25:40.992
And his old friend Socrates the Lion

25:41.160 --> 25:43.829
spent the rest of his days
staying at home

25:43.996 --> 25:47.416
and growing old,
gazing peacefully into the sky.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.626
- Then l'll just go it alone.
- What?

25:49.794 --> 25:53.672
I'd think that one over again
because if you follow the river bed,

25:53.840 --> 25:56.467
you come to the Valley of Death.

25:56.635 --> 25:58.886
Did you say Valley of Death?

25:59.054 --> 26:01.347
So how do you know?

26:01.515 --> 26:03.891
That's easy - because l've been there.

26:04.059 --> 26:07.937
You were in... ln the Valley of Death?

26:08.105 --> 26:10.565
Yes, it was long, long ago.

26:10.733 --> 26:12.984
You see my scar up here?

26:13.152 --> 26:18.614
Well, deep within the Valley of Death
there lives a murderous shadow!

26:20.075 --> 26:21.743
The leopard?

26:21.910 --> 26:25.246
Such a beast,
who can slice you to pieces

26:25.414 --> 26:26.956
before you see him coming!

26:27.124 --> 26:32.211
He who enters the Valley of Death
gives up life itself!

26:33.380 --> 26:37.967
- You're not coming with me?
- No, Billy.

26:41.263 --> 26:45.516
Let's just do what we know how to do,
what we're best at doing.

26:45.684 --> 26:48.853
Laying around and killing time.

26:49.021 --> 26:53.149
Billy?

26:54.693 --> 26:56.110
BlLLY?

26:57.988 --> 27:00.948
? Trailers for sale or rent

27:01.992 --> 27:05.119
? Rooms to let, 50 cents

27:05.287 --> 27:08.915
? No phone, no pool, no pets

27:10.667 --> 27:13.920
? I don't need no cigarettes - ah, but

27:14.087 --> 27:17.256
? Two hours of pushing broom

27:17.424 --> 27:21.594
? Buys an eight-by-twelve, four-bit room

27:21.762 --> 27:25.389
? I'm a man of means by no means

27:25.724 --> 27:29.185
? King of the road ?

27:34.858 --> 27:37.527
Hey, what?
Who do we have here?

27:37.694 --> 27:41.197
Don't be shy, come a little closer.

27:41.365 --> 27:43.491
Why not sit here with us for a while?

27:43.659 --> 27:47.912
We won't bite!

27:50.374 --> 27:54.710
- Ouch! Ouch!
- I fancy a change of pace, don't you?

27:54.878 --> 27:59.716
- A smidge on the bony side.
- You don't have to be so negative.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.762
Welcome, lad, to the Valley of Joy!

28:03.930 --> 28:07.724
I thought I was
in the Valley of Death, right?

28:07.892 --> 28:13.605
Valley of Death?! Who put
those thoughts in your head, son?

28:13.773 --> 28:17.609
Is this the Valley of Death, old chums?

28:17.777 --> 28:21.613
Of course not! That's absurd.

28:25.577 --> 28:27.703
Safe travels, my friend!

28:27.871 --> 28:30.080
Catch you later!

28:41.134 --> 28:43.635
Hmm? Huh?

28:45.263 --> 28:46.763
Hello?

28:46.931 --> 28:48.849
Anybody there?!

28:50.268 --> 28:53.020
- Hello?
- Hello... Hello...

29:09.621 --> 29:12.331
Shh!

29:12.498 --> 29:14.625
I knew you wouldn't let me down!

29:14.792 --> 29:17.002
Now we're gonna be fine.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.799
The leopard...?

29:26.012 --> 29:29.181
Shoo, kitty!
Go on back through your cat flap.

29:29.349 --> 29:32.643
Or come out and show your whiskers,
you scaredy cat...

29:32.810 --> 29:36.647
Billy! Violence will get you nowhere.

29:38.399 --> 29:42.694
- Well, so what's plan B?
- How does running sound to you?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.878
Left, right, right, left...?

30:22.820 --> 30:26.155
Ha! That leopard's scared
of little old me!

30:42.047 --> 30:45.466
A po-po-polar...b-b-b-b-bear!

30:55.602 --> 30:58.021
A polar bear? In Africa?

30:58.188 --> 31:01.149
Cosmic.

31:01.316 --> 31:04.485
And a kangaroo? Tortoises?
A two-legged...

31:04.653 --> 31:08.239
- Raaah!
- ... mouth-monster?

31:08.407 --> 31:10.366
And a chicken!

31:10.534 --> 31:13.453
Huh? A chicken?!

31:13.620 --> 31:17.915
Pardon! A Gallic cockerel
is no mere chicken.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.418
Who are you?
Who sent you?

31:20.586 --> 31:22.545
Where are you from?
Tell me!

31:22.713 --> 31:25.339
He's one card short of a full deck.

31:25.507 --> 31:27.675
But l tell you, the guy's got guts.

31:29.136 --> 31:31.262
Exactly like us!

31:48.405 --> 31:50.156
It wasn't me.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.225
- Socrates?
- Mm-hmm?

32:16.392 --> 32:19.103
What's the story behind your scar?

32:21.064 --> 32:26.735
I was very young, inexperienced,
rash and very hungry.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.864
- My brother and l...
- Wait! You had a brother?

32:31.032 --> 32:35.494
His name was Mambo.
We were inseparable.

32:35.662 --> 32:40.749
Racing across the Savannah,
chasing buffalo and hunting antelope.

32:40.917 --> 32:46.847
- Hold on... But you're a vegetarian!
- Youth, you see. l was a cub.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.174
That was ages ago.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.636
So Mambo and I,
though forbidden by our parents,

32:52.804 --> 32:55.180
walked right up to the Valley of Death.

32:55.348 --> 32:59.184
And, as you can imagine, there was
a good reason we were forbidden.

32:59.352 --> 33:03.105
After all, this is where
the elephants came to die.

33:03.273 --> 33:07.693
But we knew no fear
and we were driven by curiosity.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.488
Mambo?

34:18.641 --> 34:24.395
- Was it the leopard?
- No, Billy. lt wasn't the leopard.

34:24.563 --> 34:29.150
It was a creature
I've never seen before, or since.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.444
That's creepy.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.197
But from that day, my only wish

34:34.364 --> 34:39.409
is for all the animals of the Savannah
to live in peace and harmony.

34:54.635 --> 34:58.096
Cock-a-doodle...

34:59.390 --> 35:04.936
All right! Comrades, morning is 'ere.
We must set off before the sun is 'igh.

35:05.104 --> 35:10.984
You'll have to go on without me.
I'm much too weak.

35:11.151 --> 35:17.140
Non! I will stay with Sushi
and the tortoises and look after them.

35:17.408 --> 35:23.246
As for the lion and the euh...weasel,
they will find the water.

35:23.414 --> 35:27.292
And Toby and Smiley
will accompany them. Humph!

35:41.807 --> 35:43.308
Shh.

37:00.762 --> 37:04.431
Here at the Eden Paradise Hotel,
we now find the participants

37:04.599 --> 37:09.436
of the 168th Conference
on Climate Change in attendance.

37:09.604 --> 37:14.066
And here is someone who is clearly
not the least impressed with any of it.

37:14.234 --> 37:18.320
Hello, I'm Maya. For sure, we all know
what happens at these things.

37:18.488 --> 37:22.950
You grown-ups love to hear each other
talk and talk and nothing ever happens!

37:23.118 --> 37:26.620
I'm sure you're all awaiting the results
of the conference, as we are.

37:34.337 --> 37:36.004
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:36.172 --> 37:42.144
I welcome you all to the Eden Paradise
as guests of the Climate Conference.

37:42.512 --> 37:47.558
The important job of the buffet opening
falls to our very own house mascot.

37:47.725 --> 37:51.395
It's true, may l present...Toto!

37:55.609 --> 37:59.237
- The water's trapped like a rat.
- Who would do such a thing?

38:15.171 --> 38:17.380
Going a bit fast, aren't we?

38:19.175 --> 38:20.967
Woooah!

38:32.521 --> 38:35.440
Billy, they've stolen your idea.

38:36.901 --> 38:41.529
Hmm... How do they get
the hyena poo-poo so round?

38:42.490 --> 38:44.782
I love it, l love it, l love it. Cool!

39:04.428 --> 39:06.304
Give me five! Whey-hey!

39:07.515 --> 39:10.600
Australians!

39:24.532 --> 39:26.407
Oh, he's so cute!

39:37.711 --> 39:40.296
What?! Hunter!

39:47.471 --> 39:49.639
They're a strange breed of monkey.

39:56.731 --> 39:59.942
They're cute, though.
A little funny-looking, but cute.

40:00.110 --> 40:02.570
See you later, Billy.

40:02.737 --> 40:05.322
Now! Where's the beast, huh?

40:08.535 --> 40:09.868
Ahh!

40:29.973 --> 40:31.640
Cannonball!

41:00.670 --> 41:02.421
Ha-ha-ha... Jaw.

41:51.471 --> 41:54.933
Come on. Over here!

42:06.487 --> 42:08.113
No! No!

42:39.937 --> 42:43.231
You must know, l saved
your life on my lunch break, humph!

42:46.318 --> 42:48.653
Er, now, now, gentlemen,
if you please...

42:48.821 --> 42:53.450
I can guarantee you personally that
this whole unfortunate fiasco is over.

42:54.326 --> 42:56.244
RAAAH!

42:56.412 --> 42:59.956
- His ears have gone red.
- Here it comes!

43:08.883 --> 43:12.260
Smiley, I can't think of a better argument
for good, clean outdoor living.

43:20.770 --> 43:22.937
Eurgh!

43:56.848 --> 44:01.060
Actually, the wellness suite
is solely for paying hotel guests.

44:07.025 --> 44:08.943
Mm, wild!

44:09.110 --> 44:10.653
Eh, Smiley, you try it on.

44:20.664 --> 44:24.500
Two words, gentlemen:
mini bar, capiche?

44:25.710 --> 44:27.378
Voilà!

44:33.969 --> 44:37.555
Hands off! This is the honeymoon suite.

44:40.308 --> 44:43.185
OK, I'll watch for Hunter.

44:43.353 --> 44:45.437
You do not wanna mess around with him.

44:45.605 --> 44:47.940
You'd better behave yourselves,
if you know what's good for you!

44:48.108 --> 44:49.316
Cool.

44:55.282 --> 44:58.993
Hold on. Better
we don't take a single shot.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.287
We hate bad press.

45:01.454 --> 45:04.957
Instead, catch and send it
to our casino in Vegas.

45:05.125 --> 45:08.252
At least we can make a profit
out of this whole mess.

45:20.098 --> 45:22.182
I don't trust that monkey.

45:37.782 --> 45:40.242
Didn't l tell you not to touch anything?

45:45.040 --> 45:47.917
Where is the armchair?

45:51.171 --> 45:53.964
Oh...you uncultured pig!

45:54.133 --> 45:56.217
We sit on chairs, we don't eat them!

45:56.385 --> 45:59.179
Raah?

46:08.773 --> 46:12.817
- And where's the little guy?
- Billy is in the water cave.

46:12.985 --> 46:16.488
? Splish-splash, l was taking a bath

46:16.656 --> 46:20.283
? All-about-a Saturday night, ooh

46:20.451 --> 46:22.911
? Rub-a-dub, just relaxing in the tub

46:23.079 --> 46:26.289
? Thinking everything was all right ?

46:27.458 --> 46:29.751
That's quite enough
rub-a-dubbing for today!

46:29.919 --> 46:32.796
I happen to have a job here,

46:32.964 --> 46:36.299
and l have no desire to get
into trouble on account of you!

46:36.467 --> 46:39.302
I worked hard to get my position.

46:39.470 --> 46:42.305
What is it you want from me?

46:42.473 --> 46:44.307
We want water!

46:46.018 --> 46:51.398
Ah, right here you have water!

46:51.565 --> 46:54.359
- So now if you would get out.
- One thing.

46:54.527 --> 46:57.487
Why on earth did you help us
by hiding us in here?

46:57.655 --> 47:00.323
Because with Hunter,
you would have been killed.

47:00.491 --> 47:03.618
So, l see. You are one of us, after all.

47:03.786 --> 47:05.704
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

47:05.871 --> 47:10.041
I was born in a Brooklyn zoo -
not that you know what that means.

47:10.209 --> 47:12.502
I'm very, very sorry
but you're dead wrong

47:12.670 --> 47:14.921
and l am certainly
not who you think l am!

47:15.089 --> 47:16.923
I am not one of your kind for sure!

47:17.091 --> 47:21.219
We need water! l mean lots of water!
For all of us!

47:21.387 --> 47:25.140
Good. Then we go over to the dam,
open the floodgates,

47:25.307 --> 47:27.392
and run the water to your valley.

47:27.560 --> 47:29.436
And then you folks get lost!

47:29.603 --> 47:34.385
And so what we have created is
what we like to call an oasis of peace.

47:34.552 --> 47:37.888
In total harmony with nature,
which is of course the key,

47:38.056 --> 47:41.100
and that's called ecological tourism.

47:41.267 --> 47:43.936
The result: guaranteed sustainability,

47:44.104 --> 47:47.356
with enough electricity
generated to power several cities.

47:47.524 --> 47:50.484
You can imagine the benefits
for the local economy.

47:50.652 --> 47:55.115
You should imagine what that means for
the poor animals that live downstream.

47:55.282 --> 47:58.368
- Erm...
- They're dying of thirst without water!

47:58.536 --> 48:02.122
Maya, go to your room at once.
You know nothing of this.

48:02.289 --> 48:06.292
It's always about money, right?
That's all you ever think about.

48:06.460 --> 48:09.796
These kids... Go figure.

48:09.964 --> 48:13.508
And now, if you would follow me
into the complex interior.

48:16.554 --> 48:20.473
I'll go in there, open the spout,
then l'll come back out.

48:20.641 --> 48:25.061
Meanwhile, you make sure
you do not move from this spot!

48:37.074 --> 48:38.908
Yoo-hoo!

48:43.372 --> 48:45.457
Yes!

48:45.624 --> 48:51.045
As you can imagine, the most modern
and stringent security measures

48:51.213 --> 48:54.340
are utilised in this
most sensitive of areas.

48:54.508 --> 48:58.386
Everything is state of the art
and hermetically sealed.

48:58.554 --> 49:02.140
Unauthorised access
is totally out of the question.

49:20.701 --> 49:22.368
Socrates!

49:22.536 --> 49:24.287
Oh, l feel rather woozy.

49:24.455 --> 49:25.914
I'm coming!

49:26.081 --> 49:29.083
Ooh...

49:31.754 --> 49:33.129
Oh, no!

49:34.590 --> 49:36.925
Oh, no! Not again!

50:06.456 --> 50:09.291
Raaah! Raaah!

51:04.806 --> 51:07.224
Come, if you are man enough to do it!

51:12.314 --> 51:14.189
En garde.

51:24.242 --> 51:26.035
Hmm...

51:31.291 --> 51:32.541
Thanks.

51:32.709 --> 51:37.129
Oh, no, that's totally not fair.
No, no, no!

51:37.297 --> 51:39.840
Brave veterans, can you stand the pace?

51:40.008 --> 51:44.720
We're fine, thank you. Though we're not
quite as young as we used to be.

51:45.764 --> 51:48.223
Well, l see, heeh-heeh...

51:48.391 --> 51:50.643
a beauty in the prime of her life.

51:50.810 --> 51:54.314
Well, l'm 715 years old.

51:54.482 --> 51:57.525
Winston is twelve years older.

51:57.693 --> 52:02.947
She has aged splendidly,
my dear little lotus blossom.

52:03.115 --> 52:05.450
You, with the sweet talk.

52:06.243 --> 52:08.870
Ahh...l'amour!

52:09.789 --> 52:13.750
The 'eroism of the tortoises
has saved us all,

52:13.918 --> 52:18.213
but without water all that awaits us
is certain death.

52:18.381 --> 52:23.218
And we are doomed if we go back
to free Socrates and release the water.

52:23.386 --> 52:25.595
We are much too weak.

52:25.763 --> 52:30.266
Then we have to get help!
We'll call all the animals of the Savannah.

52:30.434 --> 52:32.102
Excellent, weasel!

52:34.063 --> 52:36.231
Daddy? What are you doing with the lion?

52:36.399 --> 52:39.234
Maya, Daddy has no time
for this right now.

52:39.402 --> 52:41.194
Set the lion free right now!

52:41.362 --> 52:45.782
There is nothing l can possibly do.
The lion is dangerous

52:45.950 --> 52:50.286
and we can't just let it loose
to run around all over the place.

52:50.454 --> 52:54.666
And besides, l've already sold
the lion to a casino in Las Vegas.

52:57.253 --> 52:58.878
Humph!

53:06.762 --> 53:09.806
You have successfully
penetrated the security zone,

53:09.974 --> 53:13.893
while your friends have disappeared
in the drink.

53:14.061 --> 53:17.605
You! Looks like you're the lucky one.

53:17.773 --> 53:21.776
- Smith sold you to a casino in Las Vegas.
- Las WHAT?

53:21.944 --> 53:25.071
You hit the jackpot.
Top of the mountain!

53:25.239 --> 53:29.784
I've always dreamed of doing
an appearance in Las Vegas, just once.

53:29.952 --> 53:32.704
Huh?

53:45.760 --> 53:48.052
I'm not hungry.

53:48.220 --> 53:50.305
Drink.

53:50.473 --> 53:53.099
It'll taste a lot better.

53:56.772 --> 53:59.565
Oh, Mum, did you have
something to drink?

53:59.733 --> 54:01.734
Of course I did!

54:02.986 --> 54:05.070
You're a really bad liar, you know.

54:07.657 --> 54:09.325
Junior?

54:20.545 --> 54:24.006
This is my water hole, crocodile bait!

54:24.174 --> 54:27.551
- So?
- You go find your own puddle, si?

54:27.719 --> 54:29.678
Or you can find my horn!

54:29.846 --> 54:33.974
Instead l'll use your horn
as a toenail clipper, OK?

54:34.142 --> 54:37.394
You're asking for it.

54:47.989 --> 54:51.700
300 pounds, and not an ounce of brain
in their fat heads.

55:12.222 --> 55:15.099
On three.
One... Two...

55:15.267 --> 55:17.059
Three...go!

55:41.835 --> 55:43.878
No!

55:56.142 --> 55:57.809
Hey, look!

56:05.651 --> 56:07.110
Aw...

56:13.868 --> 56:15.619
Mum!

56:18.331 --> 56:20.540
Hold on, sweetheart.

56:22.710 --> 56:25.420
STOP!

56:34.013 --> 56:36.556
Haven't you idiots
got anything better to do?

56:36.724 --> 56:38.850
- Erm, nope.
- Eh, no.

56:39.018 --> 56:43.146
Have you ever thought why you two
are fighting in the first place?

56:43.314 --> 56:45.941
Naturally. Because...

56:46.108 --> 56:49.861
- Eh...'cause...
- Mm-hmm...?

56:50.029 --> 56:54.407
- What do you think, Biggie?
- Hey, l don't know.

56:54.575 --> 56:56.201
Just as I thought.

56:56.369 --> 56:59.955
From now on, go and play
your juvenile games somewhere else!

57:00.122 --> 57:02.123
Got it? Hmm?!

57:06.420 --> 57:11.049
Let's go talk to Angie. She is
actually the president of Okavango.

57:11.217 --> 57:15.428
A female president!
Hmm, why not?

57:15.596 --> 57:19.975
I will attempt a bit of diplomacy with 'er,
the way l know 'ow.

57:22.228 --> 57:24.980
My skin is utterly
and completely dried out.

57:25.147 --> 57:28.692
My nails are all cracked,
my complexion - ruined!

57:28.859 --> 57:33.154
My lashes are like barbed wire.
The end is near!

57:33.322 --> 57:35.198
Giselle...

57:35.366 --> 57:39.202
- We've got other things to worry about.
- Oh, well, that's charming.

57:39.370 --> 57:43.123
I'm falling apart and you say,
"We've got other things to worry about!"

57:43.290 --> 57:45.583
Oh, do not despair, mesdames!

57:45.751 --> 57:49.838
Oh, no! l hear voices!
Aah, l know this is the end.

57:50.006 --> 57:52.382
And l look like such a mess.

57:52.550 --> 57:54.385
Ahem!

57:54.553 --> 57:58.014
'Ello, the name is...Charles.

57:58.181 --> 58:01.350
Charles! My, my, what a lovely name!

58:01.518 --> 58:04.812
By the way, the oppressive 'eat
can do nothing to 'ide

58:04.980 --> 58:07.273
your noble and sublime beauty.

58:07.441 --> 58:09.150
Ooh! Mmm!

58:10.652 --> 58:15.948
If l may be so bold, you seem to 'ave
been blessed with a delightful nose.

58:16.116 --> 58:18.200
Mmm...

58:18.368 --> 58:22.038
So soft! And the most silky trunk!

58:23.707 --> 58:25.750
Pooh! Go marry her, then.

58:25.917 --> 58:28.502
We must call a conference.
Tout de suite!

58:28.670 --> 58:33.090
- A conference?
- A gathering of all the animals.

58:33.258 --> 58:36.177
There we must figure out
'ow this hero of yours

58:36.344 --> 58:38.637
was able to discover the water.

58:38.805 --> 58:43.142
I have a hero? Erm, who is it?

58:43.310 --> 58:45.811
- Yoo-hoo!
- Billy?

58:45.979 --> 58:47.855
Hmm...

58:48.023 --> 58:50.858
Then someone's got to blow
the great horn!

59:12.464 --> 59:13.839
Dad?!

59:19.971 --> 59:21.847
Mm.

59:34.402 --> 59:39.824
There is a great gathering of the animals
in two hours, called a conference.

59:39.991 --> 59:42.576
You don't want to be late!

59:42.744 --> 59:44.995
I'm on my way!

59:45.163 --> 59:48.999
Ugh! Let's see, two hours.
I know l can do it.

59:49.167 --> 59:51.836
Thank heaven for shortcuts.

59:54.465 --> 59:57.425
Well, look who's here.
It's the lightweight!

59:57.593 --> 59:59.928
Hey, Biggie.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:03.014
What's so funny, carrot top, eh?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.529
We are all gathered together
to discuss our precarious situation.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:22.993
As you all may know, this is our first
great historical animal gathering.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:27.706
For the duration of the proceedings,
no-one will inflict harm upon another!

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:33.336
- Fine by me!
- Meerkats only really count as snacks!

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.922
No one is allowed to touch anyone!

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.550
Eh?

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.719
Billy? Your report.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:45.307
Yeah. So, here's the scoop.
Uh, I found the water, cool.

01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:48.018
Who cares what that worm has to say?

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:51.646
He's nothing but
a squashed fly on my hoof, sí?

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:57.152
Problem is, the water's trapped
way up in Leopard Canyon,

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.196
by these massive stones.

01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:01.489
It was the leopard?!

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:07.604
No it was because of a bunch of strange,
ugly creatures, naked, without any fur!

01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:09.497
Oh, that's gross!

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:12.584
We're talking bloodthirsty, awful beasts.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.878
They call themselves humans!

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.047
What a pile of garbage!

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:21.051
And since when did we ever listen
to the drivel from a meerkat?

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:25.513
Chino is a dumb buffalo,
but for once he's got a point.

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:30.185
Mon ami. This, well, meerkat

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.730
has shown more courage
than all of you combined.

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:36.983
Oh, such big words
coming from you, you...

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:38.610
..you little half-pint.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:43.073
Do you 'ave any idea what
this little 'alf-pint has been through?

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.159
Do you just know 'ow many
of my comrades l 'ave lost?

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:49.579
The things l 'ave seen
from a dark dungeon,

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:54.585
where my kind and l were locked up
only to languish in the smallest of cells,

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:57.630
while wondering if we were
to end up on a skewer?

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:00.549
Or perhaps a burgundy sauce?

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:05.263
Mankind treats us like...animals!

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.808
Well, that certainly was clear as mud.

01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:11.686
And that's why we have to do something!

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:13.980
We have to free up the water now!

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.108
Er, correct me if I'm wrong,
but doesn't that mean

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:20.027
we have to go through the...
Valley of Death?!

01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:25.741
The water has always come,
and it will come this time.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.077
We just have to wait.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:32.123
The water is not simply water.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:36.002
It is the blood of our forefathers.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:40.006
Come on, what's with these two old-timers!

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:44.343
These two tortoises know mankind
better than any other alive!

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:47.638
And, of course, much, much longer.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.224
- Good...
- ... evening.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:53.185
My name is Winston and...

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.438
..l am called Winifred.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.691
We were born more than 700 years ago...

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:03.112
..on an island located deep
within the Pacific Ocean.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.950
In all that time, we have come across
many human beings.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:10.619
They have stolen and have murdered

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:16.208
and destroyed everything
many, many times.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.961
And we let it happen.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:23.758
And because of this,
we have lost everything.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.012
Our beloved home is sadly no more.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:33.977
Where once were blooming flowers
of all colours is now dry and arid.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:38.272
Where once the very air vibrated
with the twittering

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.194
of thousands of kinds of birds
is now only silence.

01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:47.239
Where once seals and the beasts
of the ocean bobbed in the waves,

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:50.910
all life is now at an end.

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:53.955
Galápagos, our wondrous home,

01:03:54.123 --> 01:03:59.544
is now little more than a wretched,
black, dark and oily mass.

01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:04.966
The entire world is nothing more
than a black, dark and oily mass.

01:04:06.052 --> 01:04:10.180
Except for this place here.

01:04:10.348 --> 01:04:12.140
But if you do nothing to stop it,

01:04:12.308 --> 01:04:16.395
this place too will become
no more than a blackened stain.

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:19.648
For Man is a thief
who comes in the night

01:04:19.816 --> 01:04:22.150
and takes what he wants from the land.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.577
He is like a snake
who eats his own tail to survive.

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:37.416
But the Earth does not belong to Man.

01:04:38.334 --> 01:04:41.169
He's only a tiny part of it.

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:46.508
Man did not weave the fabric of life.

01:04:46.676 --> 01:04:52.606
He's but a thread within it,
for we all share the same breath.

01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:56.768
The rising mists
of the lush green forests,

01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:59.938
the refreshment
of the rocky mountain breezes,

01:05:00.106 --> 01:05:03.984
the perfumed scent of the wind
after a cooling shower of rain,

01:05:04.152 --> 01:05:07.779
the plants, Man and we, the animals.

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:13.952
What Man doesn't realise is
what he does to the land

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.330
he ultimately does to himself,

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:21.001
and when the land is finally destroyed

01:05:21.169 --> 01:05:24.713
and the animals are
either driven out or killed,

01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.550
Man will rule over the Earth alone.

01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:34.222
Then, lost and forlorn, he too
will be wiped from the face of the Earth.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:40.312
But that is a cold comfort to us now,
for every one of you will perish

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.649
if you don't defend yourselves
against humanity.

01:06:04.046 --> 01:06:09.175
My dear, you spoke wisely
and with great care.

01:06:09.343 --> 01:06:15.139
Well, that's because
they were your thoughts that l spoke.

01:06:15.307 --> 01:06:18.935
What you spoke was greater
than every thought.

01:06:19.102 --> 01:06:25.041
And still all meaningless,
compared to my many years with you,

01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:28.444
our years together.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.073
It's been wonderful.

01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:36.577
Good. So good...

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.628
Winnie?

01:06:45.796 --> 01:06:48.005
Winnie?

01:07:27.254 --> 01:07:31.799
Winston and Winifred
have gone to sleep for the last time.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:38.931
But they live on
in all our dreams and in our hearts.

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:27.229
The day 'as come.

01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:30.984
Madame,
we are waiting on your command.

01:08:31.152 --> 01:08:33.654
But shouldn't we consult the oracle first?

01:08:33.821 --> 01:08:36.907
I don't think so, dear.
Been there, done that.

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:40.868
- So, to battle!
- And down with the beast!

01:08:41.037 --> 01:08:43.162
And down with the beast!

01:08:43.372 --> 01:08:46.875
Allons! Et vive la liberté!

01:09:02.433 --> 01:09:05.769
Well! The least they could have done
is consult the oracle.

01:09:05.937 --> 01:09:08.020
I get no respect!

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:11.566
What happened to tradition?
It's a disgrace!

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.402
Did you hear what l heard?

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:16.654
We've all been asking
for advice from that guy?

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:21.076
A hairdresser who talks from both sides
of his mouth at the same time?

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:37.384
A proud army, to be sure, Madame.

01:09:37.551 --> 01:09:41.345
It is a true honneur
to be allowed to march with you.

01:09:41.514 --> 01:09:44.933
Yes, we're proud,
but are we strong enough?

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.562
Remember, the buffalo
and the rhino didn't come along.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:53.401
The 'eroic courage of our brave soldiers
will make up for them.

01:09:56.864 --> 01:10:00.408
Socrates, hang in there. We're coming!

01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:24.182
How about those
who don't have a banana milkshake?

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:26.142
Or a drop of water?

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:28.394
Hey, I can read you like a book.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:31.981
You wanna make me feel all guilty
so that l'll help you escape.

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:35.318
But you're wasting your time.
I can't do anything.

01:10:35.486 --> 01:10:38.112
The big guy with the rifle's
got the key to the cage.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.242
Here l am, confined to a cage,
but yet somehow l remain free.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:48.206
You are outside,
but you're not really free at all. Are you?

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:50.166
Hmm...?

01:10:50.334 --> 01:10:52.210
So...

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:56.005
Duty calls!

01:10:56.173 --> 01:10:59.300
Just go. Playing monkey must be fun.

01:10:59.468 --> 01:11:02.970
? You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

01:11:03.138 --> 01:11:06.974
? You put your right foot in
And you shake it all about

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:11.062
? You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:13.189
? That's what it's all about

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:17.443
? You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out

01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:20.029
? And you shake it all about

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:23.825
? You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:26.953
? That's what it's all about ?

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:39.924
Clearly you are a meat-eater.

01:11:40.092 --> 01:11:43.803
One can tell by that, euh,
unpleasant breath.

01:11:43.971 --> 01:11:47.014
And 'ave a little respect!

01:11:47.182 --> 01:11:49.934
Just look at yourself.
Stand up straight!

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:52.563
Chest out!

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.773
And why are you so late?

01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:57.776
What kind of discipline
is that for a soldier?

01:11:57.944 --> 01:12:01.321
And take your incredibly
filthy paws off my uniform!

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:06.243
To your unit! This year, please...

01:12:10.582 --> 01:12:15.794
- Everything all right, my brave hero?
- But of course!

01:12:15.962 --> 01:12:19.673
I simply 'ad to reprimand
the cowardly deserter.

01:12:31.644 --> 01:12:33.729
Showtime!

01:13:10.642 --> 01:13:12.017
Hey!

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:47.511
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:09.450
Toto?

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.904
Oh, damn.

01:14:47.072 --> 01:14:52.535
The most worthy of foes,
yes, without question.

01:14:52.703 --> 01:14:58.642
Madame, if you'd allow me, then
I strongly suggest we send a message.

01:14:59.209 --> 01:15:02.045
Send a message? Hmm...

01:15:02.212 --> 01:15:05.840
And if we're not understood?

01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:08.843
This message will be unequivocal!

01:15:16.268 --> 01:15:18.811
Oh! What's that?

01:15:54.641 --> 01:15:56.558
Each conference participant

01:15:56.726 --> 01:16:01.021
is leaving in an almost giddy,
light and ecstatic mood.

01:16:35.682 --> 01:16:37.683
Come on.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:13.404
Comrades!
We cannot wait any more! Let's go!

01:18:13.572 --> 01:18:15.907
It's time for heads to roll!

01:18:16.075 --> 01:18:19.494
Giselle, l've never heard you
speak that way before!

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:22.455
Thank you.

01:18:22.623 --> 01:18:24.666
And attack!

01:18:34.802 --> 01:18:39.597
'Ard. Very 'ard.
This could be tricky.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:46.104
What is that roar?

01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:48.356
It's the buffalo.

01:18:50.985 --> 01:18:52.944
And the rhinos, too!

01:19:08.794 --> 01:19:11.212
What do you know?
Hey, lightweight!

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.089
Eh...

01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:16.884
See you in hell...carrot top!

01:20:00.513 --> 01:20:04.433
Socrates! Socrates!

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:08.687
Start your drumming, Billy.
You've got the groove!

01:20:08.855 --> 01:20:11.273
I've got the groove!

01:20:13.151 --> 01:20:14.985
Uh-huh!

01:21:33.273 --> 01:21:34.731
Mon Dieu.

01:21:34.899 --> 01:21:38.527
Do you see that? That's my dad!

01:21:57.882 --> 01:21:59.757
Billy!

01:22:01.552 --> 01:22:03.219
Turtle dove!

01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:05.889
Billy, the time has come.

01:22:06.056 --> 01:22:07.932
Party time!

01:22:24.533 --> 01:22:26.409
? Well, she got her daddy's car

01:22:26.577 --> 01:22:29.954
? And she cruised
through the hamburger stand, now

01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:33.625
? Seems she forgot all about the library

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:36.836
? Like she told her old man, now

01:22:37.004 --> 01:22:38.963
? And with the radio blasting

01:22:39.131 --> 01:22:41.633
? Goes cruising
just as fast as she can, now

01:22:42.885 --> 01:22:45.094
? And she'll have fun, fun, fun

01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:49.724
? Till her daddy takes the T-bird away

01:22:49.892 --> 01:22:53.520
? The girls can't stand her 'cause
she walks, looks and drives like an ace

01:22:53.687 --> 01:22:56.439
? You walk like an ace, now
You walk like an ace

01:22:56.607 --> 01:23:00.693
? She makes the lndy 500 look like
a Roman chariot race, now

01:23:00.861 --> 01:23:02.862
? A lot of guys try to catch her

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:07.408
? But she leads them
on a wild goose chase, now...

01:23:07.576 --> 01:23:11.746
The hotel is finished. I'm ruined.

01:23:11.914 --> 01:23:15.333
- Are you satisfied?
- Yeah.

01:23:15.501 --> 01:23:18.044
Look at how happy they are.

01:23:26.512 --> 01:23:30.515
? Well, you knew all along that your dad
was getting wise to you, now

01:23:30.683 --> 01:23:32.809
? You shouldn't have lied, now

01:23:32.977 --> 01:23:35.478
? And since he took your set of keys
you've been thinking

01:23:35.646 --> 01:23:38.565
? That your fun is all through, now
You shouldn't have lied ?

01:23:38.732 --> 01:23:42.277
Charles, your passion thrills me
more than I can say.

01:23:42.444 --> 01:23:48.199
Ah, ma chérie, this is the first step
on the journey of a lifetime.

01:24:01.214 --> 01:24:02.840
Huh?

01:25:09.366 --> 01:25:14.662
From the 169th Climate Change
Conference here in New York...

01:25:14.829 --> 01:25:16.914
Huh?

01:25:17.082 --> 01:25:20.250
I see that we may entertain
some unexpected visitors.

01:25:20.418 --> 01:25:23.837
And it appears that the animals
are finally going

01:25:24.005 --> 01:25:26.298
to make us accountable for our actions.

01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.734
Well, what do you know?

01:27:49.903 --> 01:27:53.739
- G'day, Ken!
- Howdy-ho, jumping buddy!

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:28.524
Pal, help me out.
Where's the conference?

01:28:28.692 --> 01:28:31.652
What? The conference of the animals?

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.696
Why, it's in America!

01:28:33.864 --> 01:28:38.784
America?
I just happen to have a shortcut.

01:28:40.704 --> 01:28:43.414
Oh, what a shame.
I could have given him a shave.

01:29:06.062 --> 01:29:08.564
? Nobody is gonna stand in our way

01:29:08.732 --> 01:29:11.233
? Nobody is gonna hurt us again

01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:13.485
? Some say they wanna shoot the game

01:29:13.653 --> 01:29:17.156
? But use your brains
We know who's to blame

01:29:17.324 --> 01:29:19.992
? Nobody is gonna stand in our way

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.536
? Nobody is gonna hurt us again

01:29:22.704 --> 01:29:25.039
? Some say they wanna shoot the game

01:29:25.206 --> 01:29:28.751
? But use your brains
We know who's to blame

01:29:28.919 --> 01:29:31.295
? Let's go towards a new horizon

01:29:31.463 --> 01:29:33.923
? A place where we can all be free

01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:36.383
? What keeps you all from realising

01:29:36.551 --> 01:29:40.220
? We are no part of humanity?

01:29:40.388 --> 01:29:43.140
? We could have shared
and would have lived

01:29:43.308 --> 01:29:45.976
? Forever and again

01:29:46.144 --> 01:29:48.729
? Going there and doing this

01:29:48.897 --> 01:29:51.650
? Like when children play

01:29:51.817 --> 01:29:54.653
? But we can't let you get away

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.155
? With murder, first degree

01:29:57.323 --> 01:30:00.033
? This is the planet of the apes

01:30:00.201 --> 01:30:02.535
? And, Man, you will see

01:30:02.703 --> 01:30:05.205
? Let's go towards a new horizon

01:30:05.373 --> 01:30:07.916
? A place where we can all be free

01:30:08.084 --> 01:30:10.377
? What keeps you all from realising

01:30:10.544 --> 01:30:13.546
? They won't grant us humanity?

01:30:13.714 --> 01:30:16.883
? All they wanna do is hate us

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:19.177
? Kill us or cage us in

01:30:19.345 --> 01:30:22.097
? Please, wake up, brothers and sisters

01:30:22.264 --> 01:30:24.933
? lt's a fight that we can win

01:30:25.101 --> 01:30:30.981
? This is the dawning
of the Age of the Animals

01:30:31.148 --> 01:30:36.236
? The new leader of the world
will be one of us

01:30:36.404 --> 01:30:41.658
? You had your chance
but you built bombs to rain down on us

01:30:41.826 --> 01:30:45.078
? You hung a bell on us

01:30:45.246 --> 01:30:49.332
? We won't take prisoners

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.086
? Ooh-ooh-ooh ?
