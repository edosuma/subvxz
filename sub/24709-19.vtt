WEBVTT

00:24.107 --> 00:25.191
GOOD MORNING.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.234
GOOD MORNING, DOCTOR.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.569
DID YOU GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP?

00:27.610 --> 00:28.570
8 GOOD HOURS.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.447
HE LOOKS VERY ALERT.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.240
HOW DID YOU DO?

00:32.282 --> 00:33.491
ASK YOUR NEXT QUESTION.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.453
I'M GOING TO TALK YOU
THROUGH THE PROCEDURE AGAIN

00:36.536 --> 00:37.495
FOR YOUR SURGERY, ANDY.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.747
ALL RIGHT.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.081
YOU'LL MEET
YOUR ANESTHESIOLOGIST

00:40.123 --> 00:41.249
IN THE HOLDING AREA--

00:41.291 --> 00:43.251
HE KNOWS NOT TO USE
NO DYE.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.004
NO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO
USE ANY RADIOACTIVE DYE.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.798
HE'LL GO OVER YOUR HISTORY
WITH YOU AND GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO RELAX,

00:48.882 --> 00:51.968
AND THEN AFTER A WHILE,
YOU AND I WILL GET BACK
TOGETHER.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.511
THIS IS IN
THE SURGERY ROOM?

00:53.595 --> 00:54.763
Dr. Garrick:
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.765
HE'LL GIVE YOU YOUR ANESTHETIC,
YOU'LL GO TO SLEEP,

00:56.806 --> 00:58.266
AND THEN I'LL DO
YOUR OPERATION.

00:58.349 --> 00:59.601
I'LL EXAMINE YOUR AORTA

00:59.642 --> 01:02.270
AND THE SIDES OF
YOUR BLADDER AND BOWEL

01:02.312 --> 01:04.731
TO MAKE SURE YOUR CANCER
HASN'T SPREAD.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.108
THEN I'LL REMOVE
YOUR PROSTATE AND
THE TUMOR THAT'S IN IT.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.276
OK.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.111
WHEN YOU WAKE UP,
YOU'LL HAVE AN INCISION

01:10.153 --> 01:13.156
FROM THE BASE OF YOUR PENIS
TO A LITTLE ABOVE
YOUR BELLY BUTTON,

01:13.239 --> 01:15.617
A TUBE IN YOUR BLADDER
TO DRAIN YOUR URINE,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.577
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HURT LIKE HELL.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.163
BUT YOU'LL HAVE A MACHINE
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO REGULATE

01:20.246 --> 01:22.123
TO GIVE YOU PAIN MEDICINE.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.708
WE KNOW PATIENTS
DO BETTER

01:23.792 --> 01:25.794
WHO CONTROL THAT PART
OF THEIR CARE THEMSELVES.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.462
SHE'LL HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.965
ANDY, YOUR ADDICTION'S
A DIFFERENT THING
FROM PHYSICAL PAIN.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.093
I'M GONNA BE HERE.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.804
YOU'LL HAVE SOME
ELASTIC STOCKINGS ON

01:35.845 --> 01:38.306
TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS
FROM BLOOD CLOTS,

01:38.348 --> 01:39.974
AND WHEN YOU'RE
NOT TOO WOOZY,

01:40.016 --> 01:42.227
WE'LL GET YOU ON YOUR FEET
A LITTLE WHILE AS WELL.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.978
SOUNDS LIKE A FULL DAY.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.439
WE'VE GOT A RIGHT TO BE
OPTIMISTIC, ANDY.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.484
YOUR SCAN SHOWED NO EVIDENCE
THE TUMOR'S SPREAD.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.820
THAT DOESN'T ABSOLUTELY
PROVE IT HASN'T--

01:51.861 --> 01:55.406
THAT'S WHY DR. GARRICK'S
GOING TO EXAMINE
YOUR LYMPH NODES.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.326
BUT A PSA LEVEL OF 6

01:58.368 --> 01:59.828
PUTS THE ODDS
IN OUR FAVOR.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.080
THAT'S MY PROSTRATE SCORE
ON MY BLOOD TEST.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.498
EXACTLY RIGHT.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.999
Nurse: THEY'RE
READY TO TAKE YOU

02:05.041 --> 02:07.252
TO THE SURGICAL
HOLDING AREA,
MR. SIPOWICZ.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.711
FINE.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.841
IT <i>IS </i>GOING TO BE
A FULL DAY,

02:12.924 --> 02:15.343
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.011
FINE.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.182
THANKS.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.350
SURE.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.849
HE'S GOT A BULLET WOUND
IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.935
[SIMONE SIGHS]

04:28.977 --> 04:30.812
THE GUY IN THAT WINDOW'S
COMING DOWN HERE.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.398
HE WAS SIGNALING
LIKE HE WAS ON
A BATTLESHIP CARRIER.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.151
CHECK OUT HOW TORN UP
MY BOYS ARE OVER THERE
ABOUT THEIR FRIEND?

04:37.193 --> 04:39.404
Parking Attendant:
HE'S BURNT?
Medavoy:
HE'S BURNT.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.571
TOTALLY BURNT?

04:40.655 --> 04:41.739
TOTALLY BURNT.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.491
THE PARKING ATTENDANT.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.328
WHOA.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.539
Medavoy:
TOTALLY BURNT.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.665
HEY, I'M DOWNSTAIRS,

04:50.748 --> 04:53.501
WHY I'M NOT AWARE
OF THE FIRE AND SUCH.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.086
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THIS VAN
COMING IN HERE?

04:55.169 --> 04:58.214
NO. I, UH, WASN'T
AWARE OF IT.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.675
DID YOU NOTICE
ANY OTHER CARS
LEAVING QUICKLY

05:00.758 --> 05:02.427
IN THE COURSE
OF THE NIGHT?

05:02.510 --> 05:04.429
NO.
NOTHING YOU'RE
AWARE OF.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.805
IS THIS GONNA TAKE
MUCH LONGER?

05:05.888 --> 05:08.224
2 MORE MINUTES, YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR FIRST BOILERMAKER.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.894
WHERE'S YOUR EQUIPMENT SHOWS
TRAFFIC GOING IN, COMING OUT?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.688
REPOSSESSED.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.106
REPOSSESSED?

05:16.274 --> 05:19.110
ALL RIGHT.
COME WITH ME.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.947
RECITE YOUR NAME, SO FORTH,
THEN YOU'RE DISMISSED.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
YOU WANT MY NAME?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.366
VAN BELONGS TO YOU?

05:25.450 --> 05:28.161
YEAH. NEIL BORROWED IT
ABOUT, WHAT, UH,

05:28.244 --> 05:29.162
8:30 LAST NIGHT?

05:29.245 --> 05:30.788
COULD'VE BEEN
UP TO 10:00.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.165
I HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.875
GUESS WE ALL HAD.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.377
MORNING.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.837
HEY, POP!

05:37.920 --> 05:39.839
YEAH, POP.
RIGHT BACK AT YA.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.549
WELCOME BACK,
JAMES.
THANKS, JILL.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.301
JAMES MARTINEZ!
GOD BLESS.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.386
HEY, BOBBY.
THANKS A LOT.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.846
Kirkendall:
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ
AND HIS WIFE

05:46.929 --> 05:48.348
HAD A BABY BOY
3 WEEKS AGO.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.683
YES, I--I DID ALSO.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.060
UH, DIFFERENT
CIRCUMSTANCES.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.519
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.189
HOW MANY ARE YOU AND
YOUR WIFE UP TO NOW,
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ?

05:56.272 --> 05:57.523
THAT'S OUR FIRST ONE.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.317
SO THE D.O.A.'s IN THE VAN?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.818
YEAH. NEIL STREETER.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.363
NEIL'S FRIENDS CAME
LOOKING FOR HIM
THIS MORNING.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.199
YEAH. NEIL, UH, BORROWED
MY VAN LAST NIGHT.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.451
YOU PARK HERE FOR THE PLACE
WE'RE STAYING AT.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.703
LOOKS LIKE BEFORE
HE GOT BURNED UP,

06:10.787 --> 06:12.163
YOUR BUDDY GOT SHOT.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.206
IS THAT RIGHT?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.499
Simone: YEAH.
BACK OF HIS HEAD.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.917
Kirkendall:
THE FELLAS SAW NEIL LAST

06:16.000 --> 06:17.627
BETWEEN 8:30 AND 10:00
LAST NIGHT.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.003
HE BORROWED JOSH'S VAN.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.589
HE WENT OUT
BY HIMSELF?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.508
HE SAID HE WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING ON HIS OWN.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.009
HE WAS BEING
A LITTLE MYSTERIOUS.

06:25.093 --> 06:29.013
HE WAS BEING MYSTERIOUS
ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED
TO DO, SO...

06:29.097 --> 06:30.765
I JUST GAVE HIM THE KEYS.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.017
THESE GUYS
WERE IN THE SERVICE
TOGETHER 4 YEARS AGO.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.268
SOME REUNION.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.521
YEAH, WELL, I'M SORRY
IT TURNED OUT THIS WAY.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.689
WHAT BRANCH OF THE SERVICE
YOU GUYS IN?

06:38.731 --> 06:39.690
ARMY.
FORT DRUM.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.150
WHAT BRANCH
WERE YOU IN?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.485
ARMY RESERVES.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.154
SO, UH, HOW WILL YOU
SOLVE WHAT HAPPENED?

06:45.196 --> 06:47.198
WE'LL CANVASS,
LOOK FOR POSSIBLE
WITNESSES.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.950
DID THAT ATTENDANT
SEE ANYTHING?

06:49.033 --> 06:51.369
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA BE
TALKING TO HIM SOME MORE.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.703
WAS HE ASLEEP?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.163
LISTEN, GUYS,
I THINK
IT'LL BE BETTER

06:54.205 --> 06:56.124
IF WE ALL GO TALK AT
THE STATION HOUSE.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.375
SURE.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.877
ON, UH, WHAT BASIS
IS THAT?

06:59.919 --> 07:03.297
AS MUCH AS WE CAN GET
ON PEOPLE YOU AND NEIL
MIGHT'VE MET,

07:03.381 --> 07:06.217
PLACES YOU WENT
HE MAY HAVE GONE
BACK TO.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.719
ALL THAT COULD BE HELPFUL
IN WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.887
COULD WE DO THAT LATER?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.056
WELL, IT'D BE GREAT IF
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.724
WHATEVER WE CAN DO
TO HELP.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.059
Kirkendall: WE'LL
DRIVE YOU OVER.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.312
ANYONE KNOW HOW TO
CONTACT NEIL'S FAMILY?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.897
Josh: NO. UH-UH.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.110
SO, UH, THIS GENTLEMAN SAW
THAT VAN PARK ON THE ROOF

07:24.193 --> 07:25.153
AT 2:00 THIS MORNING.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.113
THERE WERE A BUNCH
OF GUYS IN THAT VAN

07:27.196 --> 07:28.156
WHO COULD BE
THOSE GUYS.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.407
COME OVER HERE
WITH ME, SIR.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.075
TALK IN
A LOWER VOICE,
ALL RIGHT?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.578
ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER,
I SAW THE VAN ON FIRE.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.663
WHAT WERE THE GUYS
DOING?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.540
THERE WAS NO ONE
LEFT AROUND.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.084
I MEAN, THE DEAD MAN
MUST'VE BEEN IN THE VAN,

07:40.126 --> 07:41.169
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.712
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY
SHOTS OR THE LIKE,

07:42.753 --> 07:44.005
ANY LOUD VOICES?

07:44.088 --> 07:45.506
NO.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.093
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE INTERVENING
15 MINUTES?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.511
OFFICE WORK.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.931
THIS IS BETWEEN
1:45 AND 2 A.M.?

07:55.016 --> 07:57.185
YOU WORKING
WITH ANYONE?

07:57.268 --> 07:59.187
MY SECRETARY.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.605
MMM.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.689
WHO SAW NOTHING...

08:01.772 --> 08:04.942
AND WHOM I DON'T
WANT INVOLVED.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.194
NO PROBLEM.

08:06.277 --> 08:10.198
CAN I GET JUST YOUR NAME
AND PHONE NUMBER, SIR?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.033
Y-YOU WANT MY NAME?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.951
JUST YOUR NAME
AND PHONE NUMBER.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.087
SO, UH, THIS WAS LIKE
A REUNION, HUH?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.803
FORT DRUM.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.639
THAT'S UP NEAR CANADA.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.098
NEAR WATERTOWN.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
PRETTY COLD.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.562
I'D HAVE FIGURED
YOUR REUNION FOR MIAMI.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.316
HOW'D YOU COME
TO PICK NEW YORK?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.652
ALL THE WONDERFUL SIGHTS.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.612
STATUE OF LIBERTY...

08:49.654 --> 08:51.822
ELLIS ISLAND...

08:51.906 --> 08:53.282
U.N.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.162
WHERE YOU FROM, JOHN?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.081
HUNTSBURG, OHIO.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.168
EVER HEAR OF IT?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.336
MM-MMM.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.004
NICE TOWN?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.674
IF YOU WERE A SARDINE,

09:09.757 --> 09:12.176
WOULD YOU PREFER
LIVING IN A CAN

09:12.260 --> 09:14.178
OR HAVING ROOM TO SWIM?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.680
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.432
I'VE BEEN A CAN DWELLER
ALL MY LIFE.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.021
ANY IDEA HOW NEIL
WOUND UP DEAD?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.818
MY IDEAS WON'T HELP YOU
SOLVE YOUR CRIME.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.903
LAY ONE ON ME.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.533
BASED ON WHO LIVES HERE,
HOW THEY'RE LIVING,

09:35.616 --> 09:37.702
AND UNDER WHOSE THUMB
THEY'RE SQUIRMING UNDER,

09:37.785 --> 09:39.704
YOU HAVE A LARGE
CHOICE OF OPTIONS.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.040
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME NARROW
DOWN MY SUSPECT LIST, JOHN.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.295
I DIDN'T PICK THE BIG APPLE'S
POPULATION.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.216
YOU, UM...

09:52.300 --> 09:55.177
YOU MIND STICKING AROUND
A FEW MINUTES MORE?

09:55.219 --> 09:57.388
DO I MIND? YES.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.391
AM I LEAVING
MY FRIENDS BEHIND?

10:00.474 --> 10:03.477
I GUESS YOU WERE NEVER
IN THE SERVICE.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.909
YOU AND ME LUCK OUT,
TRUMAN.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.661
GET TO TALK
IN THE REFRESHMENT ROOM.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.164
YEAH, IT'S A GREAT DAY.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SOUND OFF-HANDED.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.422
I REALIZE YOU JUST
LOST YOUR FRIEND.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.924
WHATEVER.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.510
ARE YOU PISSED OFF AT ME
FOR SOME REASON?

10:38.095 --> 10:39.555
WHY WOULD I BE
PISSED OFF AT YOU?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.057
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M WONDERING.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.266
WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO ASK ME...

10:42.350 --> 10:44.268
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.270
DOESN'T THAT QUALIFY
AS A QUESTION?

10:46.312 --> 10:47.772
WHAT ARE YOU ACTING
PISSED OFF FOR?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.857
I'M NOT UNDER ARREST,
AM I?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.484
NO, YOU'RE NOT
UNDER ARREST.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.444
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
YOUR HELP ON WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR FRIEND.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.445
AND IF I WAS
ARRESTED,

10:54.528 --> 10:55.738
I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO SPEAK

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY
PRESENT. WOULD I?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.075
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.618
AND NOT BEING
ARRESTED,

11:00.701 --> 11:03.621
I ALSO DON'T
HAVE TO SPEAK.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.749
SO, TRUMAN, YOU FIND
YOURSELF SPONTANEOUSLY
HITTING IT OFF REAL GOOD

11:06.791 --> 11:08.084
WITH PEOPLE YOU JUST MET?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.753
WE REPORTED
WHAT HAPPENED TO NEIL.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.297
YOU PEOPLE CAN
MESS IT UP FROM THERE.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.259
DON'T TAKE NONE
OF THE REFRESHMENTS.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.936
SO, UH, NEIL SAYS
HE'S TAKING A RIDE
UP TO MIDTOWN.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.690
DID HE TELL YOU
WHERE ESPECIALLY
HE WAS LOOKING TO GO--

11:30.773 --> 11:32.566
UH, TIMES SQUARE,
ROCKEFELLER CENTER?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.694
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR THE PEEP SHOWS,

11:34.777 --> 11:36.112
THE DIRTY MOVIE PLACES.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.655
MAYBE TO MEET SOMEBODY.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.657
SO THIS--
THIS'D BE LIKE,

11:39.740 --> 11:42.034
UH, EIGHTH AVENUE,
45th STREET?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.286
WELL, I GUESS YOU'D KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ME.

11:44.328 --> 11:47.832
DID HE SAY HE WAS INTERESTED
IN ACTUALLY BUYING SEX?

11:47.915 --> 11:50.000
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A BLACK GIRL.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.294
NOW, SEE,
THAT'S HELPFUL.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.215
WE COULD SHOW
NEIL'S PICTURE

11:56.298 --> 11:59.885
TO BLACK GIRLS
ON THE STROLL
ON 45th STREET,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.847
MAYBE GET A TIME LINE
WHEN HE WAS LAST SEEN.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.182
MAYBE ONE OF THEIR
BLACK PIMPS KILLED HIM.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.227
THAT'S ALWAYS
A POSSIBILITY.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.856
OR MAYBE THE BLACK WHORE
HAD A RAZOR UNDER HER TONGUE

12:11.939 --> 12:13.232
AND CUT HIS THROAT.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.734
NEIL BEING BURNED UP
LIKE THAT,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.485
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TELL.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.532
THAT'S A, UH,
POSSIBLE SCENARIO
AS WELL.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.617
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GO WORK THAT OUT?

12:26.328 --> 12:28.205
HAVE YOU GOT ME
CONFUSED SOMEHOW

12:28.247 --> 12:31.208
WITH SOMEONE
AWAITING ORDERS
FROM YOU, ROYCE?

12:31.292 --> 12:34.044
OH, YEAH. WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH ME--

12:34.086 --> 12:36.297
THINKING GOVERNMENTAL
EMPLOYEES WORK
FOR THE PEOPLE?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.885
SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT
QUESTION, ROYCE.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.972
YOU GOT ANY STRONG
POSITIONS ON CIVILIANS
BEARING FIREARMS?

12:45.055 --> 12:48.017
YOU GOT ANY STRONG POSITIONS
ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS?

12:48.058 --> 12:50.227
I'M FOR 'EM.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.730
SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE
THE SECOND AMENDMENT?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.192
ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTION
THEN, DIDN'T I?

12:57.109 --> 12:58.778
EXCUSE ME
JUST A SECOND.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.746
OH, BOY.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.332
HEY, GREG.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.583
HOW'D YOU GUYS DO
ON THE CANVASS?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
OK.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.169
OH, I--I...

13:15.252 --> 13:17.755
I WAS JUST SPEAKING
WITH, UH, ROYCE,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.256
UH, FRIEND
OF THE VICTIM.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.841
I'M GONNA BRIEF
LIEUTENANT FANCY.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.426
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
BRIEF HIM, TOO.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.636
HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.346
SAY, YOU FIGURE
WHO KILLED NEIL YET?

13:25.429 --> 13:27.431
I WISH WE WORKED
THAT QUICK.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.849
ANYBODY TALK
TO YOU GUYS YET?

13:28.933 --> 13:29.934
NOBODY YET.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.560
MM-HMM.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.774
WELL, SOMEBODY'LL BE
WITH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.942
Josh: SWELL.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.741
I GOT SOME STRONG
RIGHT-WING WHIFF OFF
MY GUY I INTERVIEWED.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.868
YEAH, RIGHT-WING WHIFF.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.745
DID YOU GET THAT
OFF YOURS?

13:49.787 --> 13:52.289
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA TRY AND SAY IT
TOO MANY MORE TIMES.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.543
MY MAN JOHN'S
GOT US CITY FOLK
PEGGED FOR HELL.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.380
ABOUT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,
GUY IN AN OFFICE BUILDING
THAT OVERLOOKS THIS ROOF

13:59.463 --> 14:02.716
SEES A BUNCH OF GUYS
PARK, GET OUT, AND SET UP
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA PARTY.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.718
ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER,
THE GUY LOOKS OUT AGAIN.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.471
THE CAR'S ON FIRE.
EVERYONE'S GONE.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.890
ON HIS FIRST LOOK,
DID HE NOTICE
ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROOF

14:09.974 --> 14:12.017
BESIDES THE GUYS
HE THOUGHT
WERE GONNA PARTY?

14:12.101 --> 14:15.229
HE SAID HE COULDN'T SWEAR
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF THERE
WAS ANYONE ELSE UP THERE.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.732
I GUESS SOMEONE ELSE
COULD'VE COME UP BETWEEN
THE GUY'S LOOKS, TOO.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.818
WHAT WAS HE DOING
AT THE OFFICE THAT LATE?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.153
WORKING
WITH HIS SECRETARY.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.405
AH.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.781
LOT ATTENDANT
COULDN'T HELP?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.074
HE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED
A MISSILE ATTACK.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.827
OUR PUSH IS THE SAME
WHETHER THESE GUYS
DID IT THEMSELVES

14:29.910 --> 14:31.996
OR SOMEBODY ELSE
CAME UP ON 'EM
AND THEY BOOKED.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.289
THE WITNESS PUTTING THEM
ON THE ROOF CONTRADICTS

14:33.330 --> 14:35.040
WHAT THEY TOLD US
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.002
AT THE CRIME SCENE,
THEY SAID THE D.O.A.
TOOK THE CAR OUT HIMSELF.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.838
WILL YOU PEOPLE STAY AROUND
WHILE BOBBY AND DIANE
TALK TO THE LAST TWO?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.339
YEAH. THEY'RE NOT LOOKIN'
TO GO NOWHERE.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.843
I THINK THEY'RE ENJOYING
FEELING LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING US CONFUSED.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.970
DARK HAIR'S GOT
A WAY WITH THE LADIES.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.597
HOW ABOUT
IF I TAKE HIM?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.640
I GOT THE OTHER
ASSHOLE.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.156
HERE COMES
THE F-TROOP.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.120
COME ON, JOSHUA. I'LL
SHOW YOU HOW TO JIMMY
OUR SODA MACHINE.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.955
JUST DON'T ARREST ME
FOR IT AFTERWARDS.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.291
NAH. I WOULDN'T
SET YOU UP LIKE THAT.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.919
YOU DREW ME,
MICHAEL.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.798
WELL, I GUESS I GOT
ALL THE LUCK, HUH?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.306
SO, WHERE YOU FROM?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.307
THE WEST.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.935
MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.478
THAT'S NOT BAD.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.313
MONTANA, IDAHO?

15:39.396 --> 15:41.148
2 GREAT STATES.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.609
SO HOW COME YOU GUYS
DIDN'T TELL THE TRUTH

15:43.651 --> 15:46.737
ABOUT BEING UP
ON THAT ROOF WITH NEIL
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.573
2 GREAT STATES.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.284
I DON'T LIKE YOUR
CHANCES OF GETTING BACK
TO EITHER ONE OF THEM

15:52.326 --> 15:54.662
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT ROOF.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.663
[SIGHS HEAVILY]

15:55.746 --> 15:57.957
IN THE PARKING LOT
ON THAT ROOF,

15:57.998 --> 15:59.333
WELL...

16:00.417 --> 16:01.919
WE FOUND OUR FRIEND...

16:02.002 --> 16:03.003
DEAD.

16:04.088 --> 16:08.008
YOU WERE SEEN
WITH YOUR FRIEND
ON THAT ROOF

16:08.092 --> 16:10.844
LESS THAN 15 MINUTES
BEFORE HE DIED.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.306
THAT'S INCORRECT.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.351
YOU'RE SURE ALL 4
OF YOUR BUDDIES ARE GONNA
BE ON THE SAME PAGE?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.478
SURE AS SHOOTIN',
LADY.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.698
SO, JOSHUA, WHAT ARE YOU
AND YOUR BAD-ASS EX-ARMY
BUDDIES ALL ABOUT, HUH?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.574
IT'S YOUR WORLD.
YOU TELL ME.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.743
MY WORLD?
THAT'S RIGHT...

16:34.827 --> 16:36.203
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.248
IT'S YOUR WORLD.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.583
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MOVE AROUND IN IT.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.712
YOU WANT TO STAND UP
AND WALK AROUND?
WALK AROUND OUTSIDE?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.839
HOW ABOUT I WALK
THE HELL OUT
THE FRONT DOOR ON MY OWN?

16:46.880 --> 16:47.881
FREE COUNTRY.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.216
YEAH, RIGHT.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.428
DETECTIVE...

16:52.511 --> 16:53.887
SIMONE.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.099
JOSHUA, YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY FREE
TO WALK OUT THAT DOOR.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.768
BUT IF YOU STAY IN THIS ROOM
AND KEEP PUTTING
STINK ON MY NAME

16:59.852 --> 17:02.563
EVERY TIME YOU SAY IT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SMACK YOU IN THE MOUTH.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.106
IS THAT HOW THEY DO IT
DOWN IN PUERTO RICO?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.566
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO PUERTO RICO.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.359
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT
HERE IN THE BIG CITY.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.403
SO IT WAS YOUR FOLKS
THAT CAME OVER.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.573
YEAH. MY FOLKS CAME OVER.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.241
HOW'D THEY LIKE
BEING STOWAWAYS?

17:14.283 --> 17:16.910
JOSHUA, WE GOT
YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES

17:16.952 --> 17:18.954
LYING ABOUT COMING
ON NEIL DEAD.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.499
A WITNESS PUTS YOU
ON THAT ROOF 15 MINUTES
BEFORE HE DIED.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.126
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.629
WE GOT A WITNESS
PUTS YOU ON THAT ROOF.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.548
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT A COLLAR FOR MURDER.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.550
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.265
JOSH, HOW COME I'M SO SURE
THAT WHEN I GO TO CHECK OUT
YOUR ARMY RECORDS,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.726
YOU'RE GONNA TURN OUT
OTHER THAN HONORABLY
DISCHARGED?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.352
WILL YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO READ THAT TO YOU?

17:42.436 --> 17:43.604
EXCUSE ME.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.773
THAT WAS A HELL
OF A BEATING YOU
HANDED OUT TO ME.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.275
THE DAY'S
STILL YOUNG.
AND SAN JUAN'S HOT.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.778
YOU GOT A COUPLE
OF EXTRA FINGERS
AND TOES, JOSH?

17:50.819 --> 17:51.779
YEAH.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.947
ALL OF US ARE
IGNORANT REDNECKS.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.408
ALL OF WHO, JOSH?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.669
ATF'S GOT A PACKAGE
ON THIS ONE...

18:07.753 --> 18:11.298
AND THE KID
GREG WAS TALKING TO
FOR GUN VIOLATIONS.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.885
AND THIS ONE OF DIANE'S
IS SUSPECT IN A THEFT
OF EXPLOSIVES

18:14.968 --> 18:16.637
FROM A POST IN GEORGIA.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.639
I AIN'T GONNA GO BACK
AT HIM RIGHT NOW.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.641
IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING
TO HOLD HIM ON.

18:20.682 --> 18:24.353
HE AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE.
HE'S GONNA WANT TO HUDDLE UP
WITH HIS ASSHOLE BUDDIES.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.321
JOSH. THIS IS MY BOSS--
LIEUTENANT FANCY.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.989
HOW'S IT GOIN',
LIEUTENANT FANCY?

18:36.031 --> 18:36.990
ALL RIGHT.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.659
SO I'M GONNA
TAKE OFF.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.286
WE CAN STILL REACH YOU
AT THAT HOTEL, RIGHT?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.539
YEAH.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.833
UH...I'M--I'M
GONNA LEAVE HERE...

18:45.916 --> 18:47.835
UNLESS YOU LET ME
TALK TO MY FRIENDS.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.795
SURE. COME ON.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.549
AND I WANT TO TALK
TO THEM IN PRIVATE.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.551
OH, NO. WE CAN'T
LET YOU DO THAT.
Fancy: NOT RIGHT NOW.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.553
WE'RE TRYING TO GET
EVERYONE'S STORY
STRAIGHT.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.221
IT JUST MAKES
EVERYTHING ALL CONFUSED.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.598
NEW YORK REVOKE THE RIGHT
TO ASSEMBLE? I WANT
TO SEE MY FRIENDS.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.933
I WANT A RAISE.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.018
I WANT A TRYOUT
WITH THE KNICKS.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.196
LOOK, I'M--
I'M GONNA SPLIT.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.531
[SIGHS]

19:17.573 --> 19:19.700
WELL,
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A LITTLE EXERCISE.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.994
YEAH, LET ME JUST
TALK TO MICHAEL.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.121
JOSH, I'M
ABSOLUTELY READY
THIS TURNS OUT

19:24.204 --> 19:27.124
SOME GANG OF BLACK
OR PUERTO RICAN KIDS

19:27.207 --> 19:30.961
COMIN' UP
ON YOU GUYS ON THE ROOF,
EVERYBODY RUNS BUT NEIL,

19:31.044 --> 19:33.380
AND YOU GUYS
LEAVING YOUR FRIEND
TO GET KILLED.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.425
THAT ALL FITS THE FACTS.
BUT UNTIL WE HEAR THIS
COMING FROM YOU,

19:36.508 --> 19:38.594
WE GOTTA TREAT YOU
LIKE POSSIBLE
PERPETRATORS.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.387
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S WHAT?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.014
THAT'S JUST
HOW IT HAPPENED.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.517
RIGHT, MICHAEL?
THEY GOT A WITNESS

19:45.559 --> 19:49.396
THAT SA-SAW US
ON THE ROOF JUST
BEFORE NEIL GOT KILLED.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.064
THIS DETECTIVE HERE,
UH...

19:51.106 --> 19:53.775
WORKED OUT THE REST
IN HIS HEAD.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.112
THAT'S EERIE, MAN.
YOU GOT IT,

19:57.196 --> 19:58.572
CHAPTER AND VERSE.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.573
[CHUCKLES]

19:59.656 --> 20:02.367
LET'S NAIL DOWN
THE DETAILS.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.085
COME ON IN,
GUYS.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.047
[WHISTLES]
WE COULD CHOOSE UP
SIDES FOR BASKETBALL.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.840
GRAB A SEAT.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.426
YOU'RE ALL WELCOME
TO ANYTHING WE GOT
IN THE FRIDGE THERE.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.221
GOSH, IT'S LIKE
A 4-H CLUB SOCIAL.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.098
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
TALKIN', I TOOK
A HALF A BURN AT TRUMAN,

20:25.182 --> 20:26.266
TOLD HIM NOT TO HAVE
NONE OF OUR SNACKS.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.601
WE'VE MADE FRIENDS SINCE,

20:27.684 --> 20:29.436
RIGHT, DETECTIVE MARTINEZ?

20:29.519 --> 20:31.939
YEAH. LAST 20 MINUTES,
YOU'VE HAD, WHAT,
3 CRULLERS?

20:32.022 --> 20:33.899
WELL, THEY'RE GOOD CRULLERS.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.986
SO, UH, JOSH AND MICHAEL
HAVE TOLD US WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED WITH NEIL.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.614
AND IF YOU ALL AGREE
WITH THEIR VERSIONS,

20:40.656 --> 20:44.117
YOU'LL BE DONE,
AND WE CAN GO AHEAD
WITH OUR INVESTIGATION.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.787
A WITNESS SAW US ALL
ON TOP OF THE ROOF
15 MINUTES

20:46.828 --> 20:49.957
BEFORE MY VAN WAS SET
ON FIRE, SO I TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE GANG

20:50.040 --> 20:52.668
OF MARAUDING MULATTOS
ATTACKING US UP THERE
AND KILLING NEIL.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.798
IT'S JUST LIKE THEY SAID.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.258
Simone: GOOD.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.884
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.429
THAT'S GREAT.
IF I WAS GONNA SAY
ONE THING TO YOU GUYS--

21:04.471 --> 21:07.599
DON'T LAND TOO HARD
ON YOURSELVES...OK?

21:07.641 --> 21:10.310
IT'S GONNA BE REAL EASY
FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO CALL
YOU COWARDS OR SCUMBAGS

21:10.394 --> 21:12.312
OR--OR THAT YOU LEFT
YOUR FRIEND TO DIE.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.314
BUT THEY WEREN'T
ON THAT ROOF.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.607
THEY WEREN'T AFRAID
FOR THEIR LIVES.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.650
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WOULD'VE DONE.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.193
NO. THAT'S
DEFINITELY RIGHT.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.863
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A FUTURE FILLED
WITH BEING UNCOMFORTABLE

21:21.947 --> 21:24.408
LEAVING NEIL
TO THE MARAUDING
MULATTOS.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.243
THAT'S GONNA WORK
ON OUR HEADS.

NO. HE'S SAYING

21:29.454 --> 21:33.667
IF YOU BENT OVER
FOR THOSE GUYS OR
WHATEVER YOU HAD TO DO.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.336
WHY DON'T YOU
BEND OVER FOR ME?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.842
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, JOSH.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.177
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.802
THAT YOU GUYS ARE NOT
COOPERATING WITH US,

22:25.886 --> 22:28.347
WE'RE GONNA BREAK
YOUR BALLS. NOW,
DO YOU REALLY WANT US

22:28.388 --> 22:30.515

AMONGST YOURSELVES.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.577

"MARAUDING"?

22:50.619 --> 22:52.746
HOW DO YOU SPELL "CAT"?

23:21.233 --> 23:24.152
THIS IS DIANE RUSSELL,

23:24.236 --> 23:27.114
HAS ANDY SIPOWICZ
COME BACK TO YOUR FLOOR?

23:29.574 --> 23:32.119
SO THAT'S GOOD, ANYWAY,
IF HE'S IN RECOVERY.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.998
HI, DOUG. I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK ON THE BOYS.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.085
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN THEY'LL BE
BRINGING HIM UPSTAIRS?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.587
WELL, IS HE WARM?

23:42.671 --> 23:44.464
SEE HOW GINA
AND THE BABY ARE.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.466
I'm sorry.
I stole your desk.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.094
ANYWAYS, I KNOW ANDY'LL
STILL BE SLEEPING
WHEN THEY BRING HIM UP,

23:49.177 --> 23:50.846
BUT WOULD YOU LET HIS WIFE
KNOW WE'RE THINKING OF HIM
AT HIS WORK,

23:50.887 --> 23:53.014
AND, UH, WE SEND
OUR LOVE AND PRAYERS?

23:53.056 --> 23:56.977
WELL, IF HE'S COUGHING,
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE OUTDOORS.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.979
WELL, TELL HIM
MOM'S A BAD EGG

23:59.020 --> 24:01.481
AND ASK KYLE IF MAYBE
HE'LL STAY IN WITH
HIS BROTHER AND PLAY.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.899
HI. IT'S JAMES.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.195

24:16.037 --> 24:19.207

ANDY'S ALREADY

THE PAPERS TOGETHER,

24:53.575 --> 24:55.494
AND THEN
I'LL COME HOME.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.038
DR. GARRICK SAID
EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD.

24:58.079 --> 25:01.374

LOOKED GOOD AS FAR
AS HE COULD TELL.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.109
IT'S JUST A FORMALITY.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.070
YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

27:35.153 --> 27:38.156
YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO COUNSEL. IF YOU
CAN'T AFFORD COUNSEL,

BE APPOINTED FOR YOU.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.334
WE WERE SUSPECTS,

29:13.376 --> 29:14.669
AND YOU WENT THERE
FISHING FOR EVIDENCE
AGAINST US.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.212
AND THAT'S
INADMISSIBLE IN COURT.

PRESSED YOU

ALL IN THE ROOM

29:21.176 --> 29:22.510
WRITING UP
YOUR STATEMENTS.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.137
NOW THAT WOULD
SHOW IN ANY COURT

29:24.179 --> 29:26.097
THAT WE WERE NOT
TREATING YOU
LIKE SUSPECTS

29:26.181 --> 29:28.975

NOT THE PURPOSE
OF OUR SEARCH.

KIND OF PROBLEM HERE.

IN YOUR ROOMS,

START LOOKING OUT
FOR NUMBER ONE.

NOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT THAT HIP
ON GEOGRAPHY,

30:47.428 --> 30:49.097

31:20.962 --> 31:22.297
OK, JOSH...

31:24.591 --> 31:26.593
NOW START SELLING OUT
YOUR FRIENDS.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.237

INFRINGES,

HAVE TO BE MADE.

I'M NOT GONNA
IMPINGE NEIL.

NEIL WAS A FRIEND
AND A GOOD PERSON.

HE WAS SUBJECTED

SUBLIMINAL
BOMBARDMENTS.

32:19.270 --> 32:23.858
DID YOU GUYS FEEL
NEIL WAS SOME TYPE
SECURITY RISK?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.109
DID <i>I?</i>

32:27.195 --> 32:29.155
DON'T ASK ME
WHAT I FELT.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.283
NO ONE ELSE
EVER DID.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.749
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO NEIL,

32:39.832 --> 32:43.002
THAT WASN'T YOUR IDEA.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.214
DON'T ASK
WHAT MY IDEAS WERE.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.635
BELIEVE ME...

32:50.677 --> 32:53.054
I DIDN'T HAVE THEM.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.729
WHO HAD THE IDEAS?

33:04.941 --> 33:06.275
BELIEVE ME...

33:09.195 --> 33:10.363
NOT ME.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.580
A REVOLUTION
WAS FOUGHT

33:19.664 --> 33:22.792
TO DEFEND THE RIGHT
TO BEAR ARMS.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.338
2 OR MORE RACES
IN THE SAME COUNTRY

33:27.380 --> 33:29.632
HAS HISTORICALLY
NEVER WORKED.

33:36.180 --> 33:41.602
IF YOU THINK THAT
I WANTED TO SEE...

33:41.686 --> 33:44.272
THE FIRST GUY
I SAT WITH
ON THE BUS...

33:46.691 --> 33:49.527
DIE BEGGING...

33:49.610 --> 33:52.822
NOT TO GET SHOT
IN THE BACK
OF HIS HEAD...

33:58.161 --> 34:00.872
BELIEVE ME...

34:00.955 --> 34:03.541
THAT'S WHERE
I DRAW THE LINE.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.795
WHO SHOT NEIL
IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.386
BELIEVE ME...

34:18.931 --> 34:20.600
IT WASN'T ME...

34:25.146 --> 34:28.066
OR ROYCE OR TRUMAN...

34:31.027 --> 34:32.779
OR JOSH.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.925

THEN JOSH SENT A COPY
OF NEIL'S LETTER

34:56.469 --> 34:58.346
TO ALL OF YOU
EXCEPT NEIL

34:58.429 --> 34:59.764
WHERE HE WROTE,

34:59.847 --> 35:02.767
"CONFRONT NEIL ON THIS
WHEN WE GET TOGETHER."

35:02.850 --> 35:06.020
THEN ON YOUR COPY
OF THAT LETTER,
YOU WROTE,

35:06.104 --> 35:08.606
"LESS TALK, MORE ACTION."

35:08.648 --> 35:11.776
SEE, THE HANDWRITING
ON "LESS TALK,
MORE ACTION," MICHAEL,

35:11.859 --> 35:14.445
THAT MATCHES
YOUR WRITTEN STATEMENT.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.406
THAT'S THE FAMOUS

35:17.448 --> 35:19.283
"LESS TALK, MORE ACTION"
CRIME, RIGHT?

35:19.325 --> 35:20.451
NO, MICHAEL.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.953
THAT'S THE FAMOUS

35:21.994 --> 35:24.747
"JOHN ADMITS ONE OF YOU
GUYS KILLED NEIL,

35:24.789 --> 35:28.584
BUT IT WASN'T HIM, JOSH,
ROYCE, OR TRUMAN" CRIME.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.299
HOW ABOUT THE FAMOUS...

35:35.341 --> 35:37.885
"SOMEBODY WHISPERS
IN YOUR EAR,

35:37.969 --> 35:39.846
<i>"DO IT TO HIM,</i>

35:39.929 --> 35:41.889
<i>OR I DO IT TO YOU"</i>
CRIME?

35:41.973 --> 35:44.642
IF YOU'RE SAYING
YOU KILLED NEIL

35:44.684 --> 35:46.811
IN FEAR
FOR YOUR OWN LIFE,

35:46.853 --> 35:49.897
THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
PRETTY MITIGATING
CIRCUMSTANCES.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.983
YEAH? WELL,
YOU FIGURE OUT
WHO DID THE WHISPERING.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.819
YOU FILL IN THE NAME
OFF YOUR OWN
OBSERVATION.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.320
NO.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.532
YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM UP.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.828
SURE.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.497
REAL EASY.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.082
GIVE UP YOUR FRIEND.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.209
YEAH. YEAH, A FRIEND
WHO TOLD YOU

36:10.293 --> 36:11.752
TO KILL ONE
OF YOUR OTHER FRIENDS,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.213
OR HE WAS
GONNA KILL YOU.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.942
OK?

36:36.861 --> 36:38.196
YEAH.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.868
NOW WRITE WHAT
JOSH MADE YOU DO.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.980
HEY.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.900
SURE MISSED
THE PAPERWORK.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.735
YEAH. UH,
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

37:17.777 --> 37:20.571
I WANNA SHOW YOU
THE VIDEOTAPE
OF ABBY'S DELIVERY.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.614
RIGHT.

37:21.697 --> 37:25.201
JAMES IS FINISHING UP HIS 5,

37:25.243 --> 37:28.120
AND THEN I'M GONNA SHOW HIM
THE DELIVERY TAPE.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.090
WELL, SHOULD WE WAIT
SEEING ANDY?

37:39.173 --> 37:40.758
MAYBE WAIT TILL MORNING.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.219
YEAH. LET HIM GET HIMSELF
TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.100
SO WHY THIS NEIL
HAD TO DIE?

37:49.183 --> 37:51.143
RESIGNING FROM
THE EXPLOSION-SITE
COMMITTEE,

37:51.227 --> 37:53.813
HE'D BECOME A TOOL
OF INTERNATIONAL ZIONISM

37:53.896 --> 37:55.314
AND THE NONWHITE RACES,

37:55.398 --> 37:56.941
DILUTING
CHRISTIAN VALUES

37:56.983 --> 37:58.776
AND UNDERMINING
THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.278
THAT WAS BAD.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.779
PLUS BEING
THE FIRST IN HIS GROUP

38:01.862 --> 38:03.823
TO TRY TO GROW UP.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.619
Greg on videotape:
GOOD GIRL, GOOD GIRL.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.121
THERE. SEE THAT, JAMES?

38:10.162 --> 38:11.622
[ABBY MOANING
IN PAIN]

38:11.664 --> 38:13.499
THAT'S THE BABY'S
CROWNING.

38:13.582 --> 38:15.334
THAT'S THE TOP
OF THE BABY'S HEAD
BEGINNING TO EMERGE.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.462
LOOK HOW FOCUSED
ABBY IS

38:18.504 --> 38:19.964
THROUGH THIS PART
OF THE LABOR.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.841
Abby: SHUT UP, GREG!

38:21.924 --> 38:23.342
Greg: GOOD, GOOD.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.220
HEY, GREG, YOU WANNA
STOP THE TAPE
FOR A SECOND?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.972
RIGHT HERE, OR DO YOU
WANT ME TO REWIND?

38:28.055 --> 38:29.974
Greg: ATTA-GIRL, ABBY.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.434
NO, I TELL YOU...

38:31.475 --> 38:33.311
I TELL YOU, UH...

38:33.352 --> 38:34.729
THAT'S SUCH A...

38:36.522 --> 38:38.816
BEAUTIFUL,
PRIVATE MOMENT.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.818
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

38:40.901 --> 38:44.905
IT IS. IT'S SO, UH...
PRIVATE.

38:44.989 --> 38:49.035
IT WAS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL
LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO
YOU SHOWED ME

38:49.118 --> 38:50.745
OF GINA AND JAMES JR.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.414
YEAH. WITH THE BABY
WRAPPED IN HIS BLANKET

38:53.497 --> 38:55.708
SEVERAL HOURS
AFTER THE DELIVERY.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.503
I APPRECIATE YOUR
SHARING THAT WITH ME.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.391
[ABBY MOANING]

39:28.866 --> 39:31.577
LET'S GIVE YOU SOME
MORE MEDICINE, ANDY.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.037
IT'S OK.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.414
THE MACHINE WON'T
LET YOU HAVE

39:35.498 --> 39:36.957
ANY MORE MEDICINE
THAN YOU'RE ALLOWED.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.210
I WANNA KEEP IT
IN RESERVE.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.548
SO THEY THINK IT'S
NOT SPREAD TOO BAD?

39:44.590 --> 39:47.468
NONE OF THE NODES
LOOKED POSITIVE,

39:47.551 --> 39:49.303
AND THAT'S WHY
HE WENT AHEAD
WITH THE PROCEDURE.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.097
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.474
I DON'T MIND
REPEATING GOOD NEWS.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.313
ARE YOU READY TO TRY
WALKING A LITTLE,
MR. SIPOWICZ?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.440
FOR MY BLOOD CLOTS
IN MY LEGS.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.359
SO YOU DON'T
GET BLOOD CLOTS.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.568
THAT'S RIGHT.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.404
IF IT GOES TO YOUR CHEST,
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.072
MIMI'S GONNA
HELP YOU WALK.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.365
AND WHILE
YOU'RE DOING THAT,

40:09.407 --> 40:11.075
I'M GONNA STRAIGHTEN
YOUR BED FOR YOU.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.456
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA
SIT YOU UP.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.874
I'M GONNA PUT MY HAND
BEHIND YOUR NECK.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.376
IT'LL BE
LESS UNCOMFORTABLE

40:20.418 --> 40:21.794
IF YOU LET ME
BRING YOU FORWARD.

40:47.069 --> 40:50.197
I KEPT THINKING
ABOUT THE CANDY STORE.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.199
YEAH. YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT

40:52.283 --> 40:55.661
PUTTING THE SUNDAY
PAPERS TOGETHER.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.038
WAS I? THAT WAS
ONE OF MY JOBS.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.333
I THINK YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE LATE
FOR SOMETHING.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.335
THEY'D LET ME
USE THEIR PHONE.

41:03.419 --> 41:06.172
I WAS PROBABLY
CALLING MY MOM.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.882
AS MR. SIPOWICZ SITS UP,

41:07.965 --> 41:09.633
YOU CAN BRING HIS FEET
TO THE SIDE OF THE BED.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.926
ALL RIGHT.

41:14.221 --> 41:16.515
READY, MR. SIPOWICZ?

41:16.599 --> 41:18.559
GO AHEAD, YES.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.151
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
ANDY?

41:27.193 --> 41:29.361
IT'S...IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.740
JUST GET YOUR BEARINGS
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.367
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD,
THAT DISCOMFORT.

41:35.451 --> 41:36.827
GOOD.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.624
THAT THING'S
GONNA ROLL WITH ME?

41:41.665 --> 41:43.000
Nurse: THEY'LL ALL
ROLL WITH YOU.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.836
ARE YOU DIZZY AT ALL?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.838
NO MORE THAN NORMAL.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.965
DO YOU WANNA
TRY STANDING?

41:51.467 --> 41:52.843
YEAH.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.178
HERE I GO.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.013
OK.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.140
OHH.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.391
OHH!

41:59.475 --> 42:01.060
THAT'S YOUR INCISION
STRETCHING, MR. SIPOWICZ.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.853
Sylvia: DO YOU WANNA
SIT BACK DOWN, ANDY?

42:02.895 --> 42:05.272
TRY TO TAKE
SOME DEEP BREATHS.

42:07.399 --> 42:10.194
GOOD, ANDY.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.363
[COUGHS]

42:12.404 --> 42:15.616
[GROANING
PAINFULLY]

42:15.699 --> 42:17.117
OH, IT HURTS.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.370
I'M SORRY,
ANDY.

42:19.411 --> 42:21.205
DO YOU WANT THIS NOW?

42:21.288 --> 42:24.166
NO. THAT'S FOR MY RESERVE.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.045
THIS IS AS BAD AS IT'S
GONNA GET, MR. SIPOWICZ.

42:35.010 --> 42:37.596
NOW SHOULD I WALK?

42:37.680 --> 42:41.058
TRY TO TAKE
A FEW STEPS.

42:41.141 --> 42:43.352
I'LL...I'LL HOLD
MY ROLLER.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.853
YOU HOLD YOUR ROLLER,

42:44.895 --> 42:48.732
AND WE'RE GONNA
HAVE OUR HANDS
RIGHT AT YOUR ELBOWS.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.901
AREN'T YOU WORKING
A LONG SHIFT?

42:50.985 --> 42:52.236
Nurse: MIMI WANTED
TO SEE MR. SIPOWICZ
THROUGH

42:52.319 --> 42:53.779
GETTING UP
ON HIS FEET.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.039
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, ANDY?

43:05.374 --> 43:07.376
YEAH. IT'S NOT TOO BAD.
