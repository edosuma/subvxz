[Emily] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.741 --> 00:10.611
[man] Fantastic routine
by Kelly Parker!

00:10.644 --> 00:12.113
No one missed you
in London.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.447
No one's gonna miss
you in Beijing.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.283
I know what's best for you.
You gotta trust me.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.285
Trust the man who had
an affair with my mom?

00:17.318 --> 00:20.121
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Could you arrange for

00:20.154 --> 00:21.755
a private sports
endowment group

00:21.789 --> 00:24.125
to fund Emily Kmetko's
scholarship?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.694
- I don't see why not.
- No one can ever know it's me.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.262
I can do the
round-off Arabian.

00:28.296 --> 00:32.066
It favors tiny girls
and Genji is ten pounds lighter.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.203
Do you think you're
over-training? You don't
wanna risk a serious injury

00:35.236 --> 00:36.604
and then have to start
all over again.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.107
[Sasha] You can be more
of an artistic gymnast.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.110
Oh!

00:43.611 --> 00:44.778
[Chloe gasps]

00:46.680 --> 00:48.582
[dance music plays]

00:48.616 --> 00:51.051
* Chase it down
Turn around *

00:52.086 --> 00:54.555
OK, guys.
Close your eyes.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.426
Picture us all making
the cut for the World Team.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.761
We're stepping
onto the podium.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.265
We're shaking hands
with the National Committee.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.601
- See it.
- [groans] I just
made the National Team.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.138
I cannot wrap my brain around
making the World Team.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.805
We're all making the World Team.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.474
No Rock girl
will be left behind.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.114
Stop looking at me.
I don't want your pity.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.750
I just want you guys
to kick ass at the National
Team practice tomorrow.

01:22.783 --> 01:27.688
Payson's right. This is the
last National Team practice
before the World Team tryouts.

01:27.721 --> 01:31.625
- We've all got to shine.
- Especially those girls who
snuck out to see boys in Calais,

01:31.659 --> 01:34.162
and fell to the bottom
of the National Team's ranking.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.665
Emily knows she's gotta
nail her practice tomorrow.
Don't you, Em?

01:37.698 --> 01:41.269
It's hard to forget when
you guys keep reminding me.

01:41.302 --> 01:45.606
Speaking of having to forget
stuff, are you OK with Marty
coming back, Kaylie?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.308
Yup. Mom and I both are.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.611
We're gonna be like
any gymnast and gym mom.
Like it never happened.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.582
You can do that? I mean,
your coach and your mom were
doing the humpty dumpty...

01:54.615 --> 01:57.485
- Hi, girls!
- [all] Hi, Mrs. Cruz.

01:57.518 --> 02:01.289
- Here's a printout
of your training schedule.
- Thanks, Mom.

02:01.322 --> 02:05.125
OK, girls. Stay hydrated, OK?

02:06.727 --> 02:09.363
- Like it never happened.
- Thatta girl.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.532
- Hey, you get the
day off tomorrow?
- [Payson] Unfortunately, no.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.734
While you guys are taking
the next step towards
the World Team,

02:13.767 --> 02:16.704
I'll be prancing
in ballet class.
Yippee skippy.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.508
Yum. Fresh blueberries
and cucumber water.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.875
Where are the hot towels?
[laughs]

02:21.909 --> 02:24.612
Whoopsie! Almost
forgot the hot towels.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.182
* It's gonna get ya
It's gonna get ya *

02:28.216 --> 02:31.785
* It's gonna get ya fallin' off
the ground, inside out **

02:31.819 --> 02:35.856
Ellen Beals said
they need two desks,
three dedicated telephone lines,

02:35.889 --> 02:38.326
a printer,
five reams of copy paper.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.395
Are they holding the
National Team practice here
or opening a Kinko's?

02:41.429 --> 02:45.799
Yeah, I wanted to tell
her what she could do
with her reams of copy paper.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.236
Hey.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.238
We've got to make the
National Committee feel like

02:50.271 --> 02:52.240
they're being taken
care of here at The Rock.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.175
Are you sure?

02:55.209 --> 02:58.379
Because you can't be too
excited to see Ellen Beals.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.215
We've gotta put our
grudges aside for the girls.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.618
I don't feel like
putting my grudges aside.

03:04.652 --> 03:08.822
I can't believe that woman
encouraged Payson to petition
onto the National Team

03:08.856 --> 03:12.326
when you knew she wasn't ready.
She can kiss my...

03:12.360 --> 03:17.631
I'm sorry. I'm not so good
at this political stuff.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.668
- You know me, I speak my mind.
- [Sasha] As do I.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.603
And no one is worse
at the political
stuff than I am.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.672
But we don't really
have a choice here.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.641
We can't give the National
Committee any more reason
to dislike The Rock.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.910
So we will welcome
them with open arms.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.512
Do you think the girls
will be OK?

03:31.545 --> 03:34.582
I don't trust Beals,
but I do trust Marty Walsh.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.418
As a coach.
He'll look after the girls.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.592
- Did you tell?
- No, Lauren!

03:44.625 --> 03:48.729
- But someone has to!
- You can't tell Dad
about me and Carter. Please!

03:48.762 --> 03:51.765
You can't expect me to hide
this from your father!

03:51.799 --> 03:55.336
You understand, Chloe.
You're a woman.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.739
What would've happened to you
at my age if your father
found out you were having sex?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.743
- Yeah, well...
- See?

04:02.776 --> 04:06.814
This happened because
I don't have a mom.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.983
I'm not lucky like Payson.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.787
Or Emily. But I can never talk
about any of this with my dad.

04:13.821 --> 04:17.791
- He'd never understand.
- Lauren, there are
a lot of things

04:17.825 --> 04:20.728
you need to think about
before you decide to have sex.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.798
Like is it really
the right person?
Is it really the right time?

04:24.832 --> 04:28.001
I mean, you need to think
about the consequences
and precautions.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.705
See? That's what I need.
Mother stuff.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.575
Just like you
and Emily have.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.312
Well, Emily won't exactly let me
have the sex talk with her.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.948
[laughs] But you're
so good at it!

04:40.981 --> 04:44.318
- Really?
- Please, Chloe.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.686
Please don't tell.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.622
Well, you, uh, ready

04:48.656 --> 04:50.624
- for the big practice tomorrow?
- Yep.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.360
Chloe was just
giving me some advice.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.495
I really appreciate
your support.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.630
I couldn't
survive without it.

04:58.599 --> 05:02.470
- Bye, Daddy.
- Wow!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.738
You and Lauren,
you're actually getting along.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.776
- You're like BFF's.
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.478
I didn't think
I'd ever see that.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.480
We're making real progress.

05:12.513 --> 05:17.351
Here. This... is for you.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.789
A key to the house.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.725
I think it's time.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.760
Steve, I don't
know what to say.

05:37.571 --> 05:43.511
- [siren wailing outside]
- [dog barking]

05:53.921 --> 05:57.324
Hi, skoodle-doodle!
What are you still doing up?

05:57.357 --> 06:02.896
Oh, I don't know.
Trying to take a shower when
there is no hot water again?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.466
Sorry about that, hon.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.501
Did you have a good time
in richy-rich land?

06:07.535 --> 06:11.138
Lounging on nice furniture,
eating good food
in a clean house?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.675
I'm sorry.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.678
I'm so sorry.
I'm super stressed.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.449
We have a huge practice
this weekend and I
have to be flawless

06:21.482 --> 06:25.586
after my royal
screw-up in France.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.755
You will be,
sweetheart.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.657
You'll be great.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.527
[rock music plays]

06:33.561 --> 06:38.031
All right, guys. This is it.
We need to have a perfect
practice this weekend. OK?

06:38.065 --> 06:42.570
- * Hey, man
- Hm.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.705
* It's been a while

06:44.738 --> 06:47.140
Let's welcome our teammates.

06:47.174 --> 06:51.679
- Hey, teammates.
- Oh, are you talking to us?

06:51.712 --> 06:56.484
- We thought you said teammates.
- Yep. That's right.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.653
Last I heard, you were rebelling
against the National Team

06:59.687 --> 07:03.591
and forming your own team
with your own photo shoots
and your own press.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.093
Um, you obviously
don't know us.
It's not like that.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.663
Well, if the "Rock Rebels" are
too good for the National Team,

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
we're fine with that.
Right, girls?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.702
- [all] Mm-hm.
- We'll just be our own team.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.838
Good luck doing this
practice on your own.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.810
Well, that went well.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.679
Well, for my money, Kelly Parker
is still the best we've got.

07:25.713 --> 07:29.449
- Kaylie Cruz did better
against China.
- It's close between them.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.919
But Kelly Parker is still
the most consistent.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.555
Have her perform
ten days in a row,
she won't win every day,

07:34.588 --> 07:37.625
- but she'll win the most days.
- That's true. But Kaylie,
on the other hand...

07:37.658 --> 07:40.761
Kaylie Cruz is really becoming
a controlled gymnast.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.864
I used to think she was too
emotional and headstrong to
be a real disciplined athlete,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
but I like
where she's heading.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.701
Lauren Tanner
is coming around, too.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.871
- I think she's leaving her
rebel days behind her.
- Yeah.

07:50.904 --> 07:54.007
- But Emily Kmetko...
- What about Emily?

07:54.041 --> 07:57.144
Well, she breaks the rules of
her scholarship by having a job,

07:57.177 --> 08:00.047
she breaks them
by competing against China,
she breaks them in Calais.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.182
- She's still pretty green.
- Look, hey,

08:02.215 --> 08:04.652
I appreciate raw talent
as much as the next guy.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.020
But she's a horse
that can't be tamed.

08:07.054 --> 08:10.691
I mean, we've all given
her a chance to transcend
her circumstances

08:10.724 --> 08:13.927
and become a refined,
elite, obedient athlete,
but she won't take it.

08:13.961 --> 08:17.230
- I think she has it in her.
- Well, we'll see.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.800
That's what this
practice is about.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.896
Conditioning, it's the power,

08:48.929 --> 08:52.700
the heartbeat,
the fuel of every gymnast.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.036
So let's see how
conditioned you are.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.271
- Circuit one.
- [rock music plays]

08:58.305 --> 09:03.210
Windsprints, squat jumps,
lunges, pull-ups and dips.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.012
- Go!
- [blows whistle]

09:11.318 --> 09:14.521
You go all the way to Europe
and only bring back
the team silver?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.857
Nice going, Kaylie.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.859
At least we
brought home a medal.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.761
Ellen Beals and Marty
said if I had been there,

09:20.794 --> 09:22.896
it would've been gold.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.834
* I get my way when I try

09:26.867 --> 09:29.637
* I get my way
when I try, yeah *

09:29.670 --> 09:31.171
Nice work in Calais, Kmetko.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.207
I can't believe they took you
instead of one of us.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.277
- And you choked.
- I'm not talking to you.

09:37.310 --> 09:41.114
Emily, no talking!
You'll do two sets of circuits!

09:41.148 --> 09:44.685
[classical music plays]

09:49.256 --> 09:51.124
We have a very famous guest
with us today.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.761
It's The Hunchback
of Notre Dame.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.964
- [giggling]
- Come on! Shoulders back!
Chest high! Come on!

09:56.997 --> 09:58.732
My great-grandmother's
got better posture than you.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.134
She's dead.
All right, everyone!

10:01.168 --> 10:03.771
I'd like a grand-plie in first,
second, fourth and fifth.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.073
Port de bras avante
and derrier Begin.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.810
[sighs]

10:12.245 --> 10:14.848
Have we never done ballet
before, Miss Keeler?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.817
- Oh, I have but...
- Tiana, please.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.020
Can you show our new
and painfully awkward student

10:20.053 --> 10:22.823
how to do a grand-plie
in first position. Thank you.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
Voila.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.063
Miss Keeler, it's your turn.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.267
For the love of all
that is holy,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.269
don't roll these
pigeon toes, please,

10:36.303 --> 10:40.340
and keep your heels down
on the ground.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.075
Go.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.980
You're moving like cement.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.116
I'm sorry, Miss Viola.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.751
I'm not a ballerina,
I'm a gymnast.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.721
and I'm here
to get more grace

10:53.754 --> 10:55.756
to help the artistic
side of my gymnastics.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.758
There is no art
in gymnastics.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.292
All that flipping
through the air,

10:59.326 --> 11:01.228
it's just a sideshow act.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.131
I'm not here
to train circus freaks.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.399
I'm here to make dancers.
Turn around.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.770
Again! Go.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.306
Smile. It's beautiful.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.875
Ballet.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.718
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.320
[clears throat]
How you doing?

11:27.354 --> 11:30.190
Good. Um...

11:30.223 --> 11:32.025
You know,
Kaylie's doing so well.

11:32.059 --> 11:36.029
- And I'm managing her now.
- You're managing her?

11:36.063 --> 11:39.099
- Yeah.
- What about Alex?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.802
Well, we're both managing her.

11:41.835 --> 11:46.006
Which is a little tricky
because...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.941
...we're getting divorced.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.678
I'm sorry.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.714
It's... It's gotta be...

11:55.916 --> 11:59.119
- I don't know what to say.
- It's OK.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.854
It's not...
It's not your fault.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.792
Our fling isn't the reason
my marriage ended.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.795
It's just...
Alex and I...

12:07.828 --> 12:10.864
- We didn't have a fling.
- Excuse me?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.733
It wasn't a fling.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.835
Not for me, anyway.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.705
I loved you, Ronnie.
[laughs]

12:18.738 --> 12:20.340
I guess I still do.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.477
And don't worry, I'm not
gonna cross the line.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.913
I learned my lesson.

12:25.946 --> 12:29.049
I wouldn't do anything to hurt
any one of the girls ever again.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.785
I just thought
you should know.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.925
- It's OK.
- Yeah, OK...

12:45.866 --> 12:48.268
[rock music plays]

12:58.078 --> 13:01.781
- [timer beeps]
- OK. Good work.
Let's start practice.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.551
Uh, Emily, not you.
On the ropes. Five times.

13:06.419 --> 13:11.391
- Yes, Miss Beals.
- Kaylie?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.126
I hope you've been upping
your game

13:13.160 --> 13:14.794
since France
like we talked about?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.063
Oh. Yes, Miss Beals.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.266
Um, actually, I've been
doing some work on a

13:19.299 --> 13:24.037
- round-off Arabian mount.
- Are you kidding?

13:24.071 --> 13:27.440
- [chuckles]
- Can't wait to see that.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.813
Kaylie has really been
pressing to get that move.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.349
- Genji Cho is the only
one who can do it.
- I agree.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.986
I think Kaylie has all the
skill to do it, it's just...

13:39.019 --> 13:41.554
It's just her body type
isn't exactly right.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.557
She thinks she has
to lose weight to get it.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.427
- It's ridiculous.
- You know how headstrong
she can be.

13:52.900 --> 13:57.070
Kaylie, I'd like
to see you do the routine
with your original beginning.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.845
[Beals] Can I help you, Belov?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.581
Um, I don't think
it's wise for Kaylie

14:08.615 --> 14:10.350
to work on her
round-off Arabian mount.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.452
She thinks she needs
to lose weight for it,
and I don't think...

14:12.485 --> 14:14.554
This is a National
Team practice, Belov.

14:14.587 --> 14:19.092
- Your opinion doesn't matter.
- I'm totally aware of that.

14:19.126 --> 14:23.230
It's just... It's just
that I'm her club coach.

14:23.263 --> 14:27.200
I work with these girls
intimately, day by day.
I know them.

14:27.234 --> 14:31.438
If you know them so well, why
on earth did you bring Austin
Tucker to train at this gym?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.841
- Excuse me?
- I guess you don't know
Emily Kmetko well enough

14:34.874 --> 14:37.177
to know the real reason she
didn't compete in Calais.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.048
Emily was caught with
Austin Tucker after curfew.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.583
- That doesn't
even sound like her.
- Sorry I didn't tell you.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.119
But the girls trust me
to keep their confidences.

14:46.153 --> 14:50.924
Now, I think it would be good
if you left this gym for
the remainder of practice.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.296
You're kicking me out
of The Rock?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.599
Bye-bye.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.172
- * Bang, bang, bang
- * You sat in those flames

15:05.205 --> 15:08.608
- * Bang, bang, bang
- * The fortune and fame

15:08.641 --> 15:12.445
- * Bang, bang, bang
- * Keep shooting for the top

15:12.479 --> 15:14.881
* Never gonna stop

15:14.914 --> 15:17.450
* Bang, bang, bang *

15:27.527 --> 15:30.597
Emily, every toe
needs to be precise.

15:30.630 --> 15:35.468
Precise big toe.
Precise little toe.
Precise every toe in between.

15:35.502 --> 15:40.107
You need to think of
the moves as you make them.
Stay in the moment.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.342
That's hard for a girl
who can't stay put,

15:42.375 --> 15:45.145
say, in a hotel room,
even when she's told to do so.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.348
Stay in the moment.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.550
- Got it.
- Come on, Emily!

15:50.583 --> 15:52.152
Keep those arms steady.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.187
Just like you do when you
carry those pizzas around.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.124
- [laughing]
- Come on! Concentrate!

15:57.157 --> 16:00.127
Tempo, tempo, tempo!
Hit it! Hit it!

16:00.160 --> 16:02.996
Hit it!
Hold in that stomach!

16:03.030 --> 16:06.366
Energy all the way
through the fingertips!

16:06.399 --> 16:08.668
Since when did you
get creepy Madonna arms?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.237
What are you talking about?

16:11.638 --> 16:15.108
- Oh, my God.
- What?

16:15.142 --> 16:18.411
I'm toner now because
I'm working out more,
training harder.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.614
- You're just hurting yourself.
- I don't expect you
to understand,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.550
because you're not the
National Champion, are you?

16:23.583 --> 16:26.119
No one knows you
like your competition.

16:26.153 --> 16:29.356
I know the pressure
we're under to stay small.

16:29.389 --> 16:34.261
I'll keep your secret,
but I'm just telling you,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.096
be careful.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.467
[rap-rock music plays]

16:40.500 --> 16:45.038
All right, ladies.
Let's do a set of windsprints
before calling it a day.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.178
Two sets for you,
Emily. Go!

16:51.211 --> 16:57.050
* Well, I don't care
I was made for this! **

16:58.785 --> 17:02.489
Payson, how did your
ballet lesson go?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.724
Turns out I'm a circus
freak with bad posture.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.326
Who knew?

17:06.359 --> 17:10.029
Payson, I know you're
not too keen on having
to go to ballet class...

17:10.063 --> 17:12.265
- 'Cause it sucks.
- ...when what you really want

17:12.299 --> 17:14.067
is to be in The Rock
at National Team practice.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.103
But you have to keep
your chin up.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.138
I know you think
there's only one path
to going to the Olympics.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.307
But trust me,
you have your own path.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.076
You weren't there, OK? You
didn't just spend three hours

17:23.110 --> 17:27.247
being poked and prodded
by Mistress Viola,
who is mean and rude and...

17:27.280 --> 17:31.584
...mean! So it's easy for you
to sit there and bark out orders
and inspirational la-dee-das

17:31.618 --> 17:33.753
when you aren't the one
who has to do any of this!

17:37.124 --> 17:40.127
And another thing.
Who eats cereal for dinner?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.099
You looked good
out there, kiddo.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.235
Thanks, Mom.
I felt good, too.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.803
Even though Kelly Parker
is trying to game me.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.141
Oh, please.
She's just jealous
of you, sweetie.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.746
Did you talk
to Marty today?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.483
A little.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.286
And? Was it weird?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.488
What did you guys talk about?

18:11.191 --> 18:15.362
Nothing. Just small talk.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.230
It's like she's even
more mad at me than ever.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.099
She obviously doesn't think
I belong on the National Team.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.303
And I'd like for her to take
her entire wardrobe back

18:23.336 --> 18:25.372
to the Adidas outlet
where she bought it.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.540
Mom, this is serious.

18:27.574 --> 18:31.311
The head of the National
Team doesn't think I'm for real.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.480
Sometimes, I feel
like an imposter.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.715
- Honey!
- I can't help it.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.317
Sometimes, I just
feel like a big fake,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.219
and that everybody
is gonna find me out.

18:39.252 --> 18:42.389
That's how I felt all day,
like Ellen Beals found me out.

18:42.422 --> 18:46.159
Honey, you can't fake your way
into a scholarship

18:46.193 --> 18:47.694
and into the best gym
in the country

18:47.727 --> 18:50.397
and onto the National Team
and into two medals

18:50.430 --> 18:53.333
against the best team
in the world.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.235
Nobody's that good
of a faker.

18:55.268 --> 18:59.105
- Thanks, Mom.
- What about your sponsors?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.507
The Kippman Sports
Endowment Group.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.110
They could've chosen any athlete
they wanted in the world,

19:04.143 --> 19:09.616
and they chose you.
A private sports endowment
group believes in Emily Kmetko.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.320
Thank you for saying that.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.423
We can go home now.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.193
What if we were home now?

19:31.871 --> 19:35.141
- We could live here?
- We could.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.445
I crunched the numbers,
and between what you get
from The Kippman Group

19:38.478 --> 19:40.913
and what I make at the
salon, we could swing it.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.916
We have to sign
a two-year lease, but...

19:43.950 --> 19:47.153
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- [laughs]

* In the back of my mind

20:02.235 --> 20:06.739
* There are no surprises

20:06.773 --> 20:08.975
* It's the way I want it

20:13.646 --> 20:18.217
* There's a hair in your face

20:18.251 --> 20:21.454
* That the wind plays with

20:25.592 --> 20:29.962
* It dances

20:29.996 --> 20:32.932
* Just a little bit

20:36.969 --> 20:42.575
* It's blue

20:42.609 --> 20:45.545
* Sunshine

20:45.578 --> 20:47.580
* I can taste it

20:47.614 --> 20:50.450
- [knocking]
- Can I come in?

20:50.483 --> 20:53.353
* Like citrus on my chin

20:55.455 --> 20:59.292
You know, I was always gonna
get us a house when I made it.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.261
That was always
part of the plan.

21:02.295 --> 21:06.733
And here it is.
So, what's the problem?

21:10.269 --> 21:14.507
It's just all
happening so fast.

21:14.541 --> 21:18.611
I've been dreaming
about this for so long,

21:18.645 --> 21:21.013
you know,
like my whole life?

21:21.047 --> 21:24.817
And then, pow.
I'm at The Rock.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.554
And I'm on the National Team.
All of it, in a year.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.256
And all of this isn't cool?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.893
I was really good
at dreaming it,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.895
but living it...

21:40.032 --> 21:42.034
Sometimes, I just feel like...

21:44.036 --> 21:45.905
...like I'm under
attack from all sides,

21:45.938 --> 21:47.306
like that video game
that you're always playing.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.309
- ThunderForce.
- Yeah.

21:52.612 --> 21:56.916
I was fine with being
the great white hope

21:56.949 --> 22:00.319
of the Kmetko family.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.021
I wanted to be that.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.057
But now that it's here,

22:05.091 --> 22:06.926
I'm just under
so much pressure.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.897
And I don't want
to let us down.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.400
Emily, you can
never let us down.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.639
You and I have had a lot
of disappointments, Bri.

22:24.744 --> 22:28.815
I don't want to be the one
who disappoints you this time.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.717
I can't.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.854
Emily, you're my hero.
I mean that.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.056
You can do things that I can't,

22:37.089 --> 22:39.526
not only with your body,
but with your heart.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.028
I mean, you got guts.

22:42.061 --> 22:46.065
You know how you always
tell me that I'm like the
smartest person you know?

22:46.098 --> 22:49.001
Yeah.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.938
The one thing I know for sure
is that you're gonna make it.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.940
And it's not just me.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.443
The Kippman Endowment Group,
they believe in you, too.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.448
You know what?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.418
You're right.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.988
We're gonna get this house.
[laughs]

23:13.392 --> 23:16.028
- You wanna know
something funny?
- What?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.164
You're my hero, too.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.003
So are you really sure
you're going to be elected?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.773
Well, I am running
virtually unopposed

23:26.806 --> 23:29.742
and the president
of the Parents Board
has a lot of influence.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.812
You need more than influence
to get rid of Sasha Belov.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.048
- I need something concrete.
- What, like dirt?

23:36.082 --> 23:41.120
Exactly. By the way, your
Kippman Endowment Group
paperwork is being generated.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.724
Let me remind you,
it is imperative not
to let Emily Kmetko know

23:44.757 --> 23:47.393
I'm her benefactor.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.061
You're putting your money
on the wrong horse, Steve.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.531
Emily Kmetko does not have what
it takes to go all the way.

23:51.564 --> 23:55.001
- [door opens]
- Big news! I'm about
to be the lady of a house!

23:57.504 --> 24:00.139
Um, am I
interrupting something?

24:00.172 --> 24:03.543
So Lauren's passport really
does have to be in order

24:03.576 --> 24:06.513
- before she goes on any
more international meets.
- I'll make sure of it.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.682
I'll find my way out.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.051
Mr. Tanner, Miss Kmetko.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.525
I thought that you told me
we were exclusive, Steve.

24:18.558 --> 24:22.194
[laughs] You think...

24:22.228 --> 24:26.899
That woman is about as sexually
attractive as a drag queen.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.769
Then what exactly
was she doing here?

24:29.802 --> 24:33.072
And please don't expect me
to believe that passport BS.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.976
Chloe, I tell you all the time
how political this sport can be.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.478
If I have access
to Ellen Beals,

24:39.512 --> 24:41.047
is it so wrong for me
to use it,

24:41.080 --> 24:44.016
to encourage her to
be supportive of our girls?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.887
No.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.123
So you really told her

24:51.157 --> 24:54.026
to be supportive
of Emily, too?

24:54.060 --> 24:57.530
That's exactly
what I told her.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.510
You will be doing
selected routines today.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.245
As you all know, in two weeks

25:13.279 --> 25:16.515
the Worlds Team will be selected
from amongst the 12 of you.

25:16.549 --> 25:20.486
What you don't know
is that only ten of you
will go onto the trials.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.190
And we're choosing
those ten girls today.

25:24.223 --> 25:28.127
The rest of the National
Committee will be here any
moment to begin the review.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.062
So let's get in
one last rehearsal.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.263
And furthermore...

25:32.999 --> 25:36.168
Excuse me! No parents will
be allowed to observe today!

25:36.202 --> 25:39.906
Private practice!
Let's all exit now. Single file.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.877
Good luck. I'm confident
the very best among you

25:44.911 --> 25:47.146
will represent our great nation.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.286
- [classical music plays]
- And one,

25:54.320 --> 25:57.590
two and three,
and one...

25:57.624 --> 25:59.258
You know, this really
isn't difficult.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.061
You're making it look
as ghastly as The Macarena.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.697
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.966
You could always quit.

26:06.999 --> 26:11.337
Oh. Please, feel free
to join us whenever
it's convenient for you.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.141
I'm sorry for my tardiness,
Miss Viola.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.645
Mm-hm. Everyone
to the bar, please.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.713
- What are you doing here?!
- You were right.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.816
It's easy for me to give advice
when I don't have
to do it myself.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.819
Mr. Belov, let's see
if you are capable of more
than just idle chitchat

26:26.853 --> 26:30.089
in my classroom, shall we?
First position.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.760
Yes, heels together.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.663
[laughs]

26:36.696 --> 26:38.264
Officially, you are
the worst student here.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.868
- I can only improve.
- Better pray for a miracle.

26:41.901 --> 26:45.905
I'm here with you, for you,
every step of the way.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.207
You're taking an unusual road
to the Olympics, Payson,

26:48.240 --> 26:51.778
and I want you to know
I'll be by your side
and we'll get there together.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.781
Stop talking!
What is this arm pose?

26:54.814 --> 26:57.083
I mean, it's like you're
spooning a hippo or something.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.252
Payson, yours
is actually quite lovely.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.923
Can you please show this
ungraceful fool how it's done?

27:10.863 --> 27:12.732
Now, face front.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.912
There is excellent
choreography in this
new routine, Emily.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.827
- Oh! Damn it!
- You OK?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.662
- Yeah. Just rolled it.
- Do it again.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.332
Uh, let's give her a minute.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.668
- She just rolled her ankle.
- I said do it now.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.638
What would happen if she rolled
her ankle in the Olympics?
Would we say, "Take it easy?"

27:52.671 --> 27:54.841
Or would we say,
"Do it again?"

28:04.250 --> 28:07.386
Hang... Hang on, Emily.
A word, please?

28:11.157 --> 28:13.359
What's your problem with her?

28:13.392 --> 28:16.362
I thought we agreed today's
practice was to see what
these girls were made of.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.798
- I'm testing her.
- You're bullying her.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.033
You came here with the
intention of getting her cut.

28:21.067 --> 28:25.337
[scoffs] That girl is dangerous
because she's streaky.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.740
She'll choke five days in a row,
then come out of nowhere

28:27.774 --> 28:29.408
and take the rightful spot
of a girl

28:29.441 --> 28:31.744
who listens to authority
and follows the rules!

28:31.778 --> 28:34.346
I appreciate your insight
and input as the head
of the National Committee.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.882
But I am, however, the coach.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.751
And I don't want Kaylie Cruz to
do the round-off Arabian mount,

28:38.785 --> 28:41.821
and I want you to give
this girl a freaking break.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.690
We have a chance here

28:44.723 --> 28:47.827
to put together the best
Olympic team in history, Marty.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.831
Now is not the time
to go all girly on me.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.465
All girly?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.434
Maybe you could use
a dose of "girly"

28:55.467 --> 28:58.037
so you could let go
of this slavish demand

28:58.070 --> 29:00.907
for total reverence
to authority you think you need

29:00.940 --> 29:02.474
to put together
a winning Olympic team.

29:02.508 --> 29:07.046
Lady, it's not your will that
will make the best gymnasts.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.015
It's their heart!

29:13.185 --> 29:16.989
Excuse me. The Committee
and I have a few things
we need to discuss.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.524
You do that.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.431
- Is Emily OK?
- Um, she's hanging in there.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.434
- She'll be OK.
- Are you sure?

29:28.467 --> 29:31.237
Beals seems
to have it out for her.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.141
Well, Steve has
an in with Ellen.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.810
He made her promise
to look out after Emily.

29:37.844 --> 29:42.014
Steve had a private
meeting with Ellen Beals?

29:42.048 --> 29:45.952
Mm-hm. You know Steve.
He has an in with everyone.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.861
Marty? A word?

30:02.401 --> 30:06.472
The Committee feels
we have made a mistake
in lifting your suspension.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.841
So, what are you saying?
I'm still suspended?

30:08.875 --> 30:12.311
No. This time,
you're fired.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.169
You're leaving again?

30:39.071 --> 30:40.339
Listen to me, Emily.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.475
I have never been more excited
or amazed by anyone's raw talent

30:43.509 --> 30:46.478
as I was the day I walked into
the Fresno YMCA and I saw you

30:46.512 --> 30:48.447
just flying across the gym

30:48.480 --> 30:52.418
with the kind of freedom
you can't teach.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.486
You are it, Emily.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.355
Don't let anyone
take that away from you.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.990
You understand me?

31:04.063 --> 31:06.966
[Beals] Could I have
everyone's attention?

31:06.999 --> 31:09.368
I have an announcement to make.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.911
Marty Walsh is no longer
the coach of the National Team.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.914
So, who is gonna be our coach?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.484
I am.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.895
So it's a very important day.

31:36.929 --> 31:40.866
Only ten of you will
be invited to the trials
for the World Team.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.602
And two of you will be cut.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.205
Today.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.641
Let's begin the review.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.012
[dance music plays]

31:57.984 --> 32:01.153
* You focus all your passion
like a laser beam *

32:01.187 --> 32:05.624
* You're pushing
all distraction
and it keeps it clean *

32:05.657 --> 32:08.927
* You're gonna make a spectacle
A crazy scene *

32:08.961 --> 32:12.631
* It's a shot at glory
of the likes you never seen *

32:12.664 --> 32:15.467
We've seen enough of
your vaulting, Emily.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.702
We'd like to see your beam.

32:16.735 --> 32:21.540
But vault is becoming one of
Emily's best events and beam...

32:21.573 --> 32:24.376
My worst.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.646
* It's all yours

32:27.679 --> 32:30.616
- * Let it roll
- * Get down, start it up

32:30.649 --> 32:36.622
* Push it to the edge
and then you take control *

32:36.655 --> 32:39.992
* Get down, start it up
Take it to the limit *

32:40.026 --> 32:44.296
* And you take control

32:44.330 --> 32:47.266
* Get down, start it up
Take it to the limit *

32:47.299 --> 32:49.168
* And let it...

32:49.201 --> 32:51.670
Well, we have far better
beamers than Emily Kmetko.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.206
Let's see how she does
in the second round.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.419
* Let it roll

33:07.453 --> 33:10.522
* Get down, start it up
Push it to the edge *

33:10.556 --> 33:14.660
* And then you take control

33:14.693 --> 33:18.197
* Get down, start it up
Take it to the limit *

33:18.230 --> 33:23.235
- * And let it roll *
- [clapping]

33:29.508 --> 33:31.710
I think that will be good
enough to get you there, Lauren.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.679
Go ahead and put
on your sweats.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.215
Oh, and could you
do me a favor?

33:37.149 --> 33:38.717
Give this to
your dad for me.

34:02.641 --> 34:06.078
- You're welcome.
- For what?

34:06.112 --> 34:09.481
The Kippman Group, who so
believes in you as a gymnast,

34:09.515 --> 34:13.085
- is my father.
- [laughs] What are
you talking about?

34:13.119 --> 34:15.487
My father is funding
your whole life.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.389
[scoffs]

34:19.691 --> 34:23.028
But I can promise he's
not paying you because
you're a great gymnast.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.664
He's paying your mother because
she's having sex with him.

34:35.741 --> 34:39.077
Emily! Emily?
What's... What happened?

34:39.111 --> 34:40.712
Did you make it?
Are we going to Worlds?

34:40.746 --> 34:43.048
No, we're not going anywhere.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.083
We're not going
to some new house,
and we're not going to Worlds.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.786
And I have you and your
money-bags boyfriend
to thank for it!

34:47.819 --> 34:50.088
- Honey, what are
you talking about?
- Don't tell me you don't know!

34:50.122 --> 34:52.691
The Kippman Endowment Group,
it's Steve Tanner, Mom!

34:52.724 --> 34:56.061
It's all a fraud! A lie!

34:56.094 --> 34:58.697
Emily, what
are you talking about?

34:58.730 --> 35:03.569
And the worst part is
that you let me think that
I got this on my own merit.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.205
How could you do that to me?

35:06.238 --> 35:08.807
I guess the joke's on me, huh?

35:08.840 --> 35:12.611
No, no, no. Emily,
I promise you,

35:12.644 --> 35:15.247
I had no idea that Steve
had anything to do
with the endowment.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.450
I told him we didn't want
the money, just like you asked.

35:19.851 --> 35:23.189
I swear to you, Emily,
this is news to me.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.326
I believe you, Mom.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.762
Um... OK, look. You just
have to get it together,

35:30.796 --> 35:33.165
- and get back in there.
- No!

35:33.199 --> 35:37.169
There's no way
that I'm gonna make it.

35:37.203 --> 35:41.573
I cannot get back in there
and perform in front
of Lauren and Beals.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.775
Yes, you can, Emily!

35:43.809 --> 35:47.246
I don't care if the
Kippman Group or Santa Claus

35:47.279 --> 35:52.618
or Barack Obama himself believes
that you can get to Worlds, OK?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.186
[sobbing] Why,
because you believe in me?

35:54.220 --> 35:57.789
No, I do believe in you, but
that doesn't matter either.

35:57.823 --> 36:03.762
Emily, it's easy to think
that you're gonna make it
when everything is hunky-dory,

36:03.795 --> 36:08.267
but it's when the going gets
tough that you have to ask
yourself one question.

36:08.300 --> 36:12.571
Do you believe in you?
In your gut.

36:12.604 --> 36:18.143
Honey, only you
can answer that question, OK?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.878
So now, do you?

36:22.814 --> 36:26.485
Kaylie, I told the
Committee about your
round-off Arabian mount,

36:26.518 --> 36:28.820
- and they're eager to see it.
- Oh, great.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.757
Um, but it isn't
perfect yet.
I'm still working on it.

36:31.790 --> 36:35.527
They're just impressed that
you're even attempting a move
that only Genji Cho can do.

36:35.561 --> 36:39.298
It shows tremendous discipline,
exactly what we like
to see in our Olympians.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.367
You're looking more
like a captain every day.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.734
Thanks for having faith
in me, Miss Beals.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.170
- Coach Beals.
- Right.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.506
And I'm going to get it
competition ready.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.940
I know you are.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.617
[exhales]

37:14.900 --> 37:17.469
Wow.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.237
Excellent job, Kaylie.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.706
She's our girl.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.844
Can't you see? Kaylie's
obviously getting too thin.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.747
[Beals] You know what I see?
A disciplined champion

37:28.780 --> 37:30.949
who is doing everything she can
to be the winner.

37:30.982 --> 37:35.721
OK, looks like our final
girl is Emily Kmetko.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.623
Emily?

37:37.656 --> 37:40.792
She's missing. Again.
Can't say that I'm surprised.

37:40.826 --> 37:44.696
Miss Beals?
I think it's my turn.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.232
Emily, how nice
of you to join us.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.968
Your final exercise today
will be floor.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.305
- That is, if your ankle...
- I feel great,
but thanks for the concern.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.017
[Kaylie] Great job, Emily.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.362
What's this?

38:50.396 --> 38:52.431
I saw what you were
eating for dinner

38:52.464 --> 38:54.433
and thought you could use
a more well-balanced meal.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.468
So I made you this.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.970
- Is this what I think it is?
- Romanian stuffed peppers.

38:59.004 --> 39:02.541
I know it's no Shredded Wheat,
but I think I did an OK job.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.310
Payson, this is...
this is fantastic.
I haven't had this dish since...

39:05.343 --> 39:07.746
Since your mother used
to make it after a big meet?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.981
I know, it's in your book.
Do you like it?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.852
I love it.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.354
Hey, why don't you
have some with me?

39:21.493 --> 39:24.463
[indistinct chatter]

39:24.496 --> 39:26.865
We are happy to announce
the ten girls

39:26.898 --> 39:30.502
who will be going
on to compete for the
six spots on the World Team.

39:32.671 --> 39:36.542
- Kaylie Cruz, number one.
- [applause]

39:37.576 --> 39:39.445
- Kelly Parker.
- [laughs]

39:39.478 --> 39:41.012
Kristen Henneford.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.382
- Lauren Tanner.
- [sighs]

39:44.416 --> 39:45.917
Beth Atchinson.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.053
Tessa Grande.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.621
Annie Dillon.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.624
Andrea Conway.

39:52.658 --> 39:54.059
Vivian Lee.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.633
And Emily Kmetko.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.535
- [applause]
- [sighs]

40:06.572 --> 40:09.775
- We will see you in two weeks.
- [all cheering]

40:12.444 --> 40:16.848
Payson, I know you always
thought that was your road.

40:16.882 --> 40:20.786
And, I'll admit, we're taking
an unconventional route.

40:20.819 --> 40:24.590
But your training is just
as important as anything
they're doing inside that gym,

40:24.623 --> 40:27.559
and it will get us
where we want to go.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.929
But if you need a reminder,
I want you to have this.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.739
This is your Olympic
gold medal, Sasha.
I... I can't take this.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.908
I'm not giving it to you.
I'm just lending it to you

40:42.941 --> 40:44.743
until you can replace it
with one of your own.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.479
You're that sure that I'm
gonna make it to the Olympics,

40:47.513 --> 40:49.447
that your plan
for me will work?

40:57.556 --> 41:00.458
[indistinct chattering]

41:03.228 --> 41:05.531
- We made it!
- [squealing]

41:05.564 --> 41:07.599
- And Lauren did, too.
- All right!

41:10.636 --> 41:12.904
- Congratulations, honey!
- Your girl made it.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.540
I heard!
I'm so happy for you!

41:14.573 --> 41:17.142
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about Emily.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.046
Ellen Beals told me
to give you this.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.121
I hope you break up with him.
You clearly can't trust him.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.924
- Emily...
- He lied to you, Mom.

41:32.958 --> 41:37.128
God, I feel so ashamed.
I wish I could just take
a shower and wash it all away.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.631
I'm sure he had
a good reason.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.036
We have to give
back every penny.
You know that.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.139
We have to find
a way to make ends meet.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.241
I don't know what
we're gonna do, Emily.

41:52.944 --> 41:56.882
Well, I know
what I have to do.

42:13.799 --> 42:17.268
- So, what did Marty tell you?
- He told me to watch my back.

42:17.302 --> 42:20.606
That Ellen Beals
was gunning for me.
Don't worry.

42:20.639 --> 42:24.776
She can't get her claws into me.
I'm a club coach.
What can she do?

42:26.177 --> 42:28.614
She can plant a mole.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.916
Steve Tanner had a private
meeting with her last night.

42:30.949 --> 42:34.219
- And he's running for
head of the Parents Board.
- He can't win.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.622
Well, he doesn't really
have any competition.

42:36.655 --> 42:37.723
Who could beat him
at this point?

42:41.092 --> 42:43.261
What, me?
Are you kidding?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.063
You're the most trustworthy
parent in the gym.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.132
That's because
I stayed out of the politics!

42:47.165 --> 42:48.266
Maybe it's time you got in.

42:48.299 --> 42:51.637
[soft ballad plays]

42:59.110 --> 43:03.181
* Soon

43:03.214 --> 43:05.250
* I'll be

43:08.219 --> 43:10.188
* Complete

43:13.091 --> 43:15.293
* No retreat

43:17.896 --> 43:20.031
* On my feet

43:23.702 --> 43:26.905
* You are everything

43:26.938 --> 43:30.308
* That you want to be

43:30.341 --> 43:33.278
* You are everything

43:33.311 --> 43:36.682
* That you want to be

43:36.715 --> 43:39.818
* You are everything

43:39.851 --> 43:43.054
* That you want to be

43:43.088 --> 43:46.191
* You are everything

43:48.860 --> 43:52.030
* We are everything

43:52.063 --> 43:55.233
* That we want to be

43:55.266 --> 43:58.737
* We are everything *
