WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.303
GILES: Previously on
Buffy, the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.804
BUFFY: Tell me what kind
 of demon I'm fighting.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.908
MAN: Glory isn't a demon.
 She's a god.

00:07.939 --> 00:11.079
Tell me where the key is.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.314
We had to hide the key.
Made it human.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.984
-Sent it to you.
-BUFFY: Dawn.

00:17.016 --> 00:19.219
I know you got a lot
on your mind.

00:19.253 --> 00:23.724
You decide you wanna
let me in on any of it,
you let me know.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.327
Buffy's like nobody else
 in the world.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.696
But she doesn't love me.

00:28.728 --> 00:31.699
-They want me back, Buffy.
-Are you going?

00:31.731 --> 00:35.703
-I don't know.
If we can't work this out--
-This is goodbye?

00:38.072 --> 00:39.307
Riley!

00:43.143 --> 00:46.546
There's something that
you need to know about Dawn.

00:46.579 --> 00:49.283
Why does everybody start acting
all weird when I'm around?

00:49.317 --> 00:53.020
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it
with her life,

00:53.052 --> 00:55.956
so they sent the key to her
in the form of her sister."

00:58.826 --> 01:01.027
-Is this blood?
-What did you do?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.530
I'm not a key.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.765
-I'm not real.
-You're the key.

01:04.798 --> 01:08.602
Go. Before she finds you.
She's here!

01:08.635 --> 01:10.138
I love you.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.740
The only chance you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

01:13.774 --> 01:18.579
I want you out.
I want you out of this town,
I want you off this planet.

01:18.611 --> 01:22.582
You don't come near me,
my friends, or my family again,
ever. Understand?

01:31.525 --> 01:35.929
(grunting)
Spike!
Spike wants me.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.632
-How obscene is that?
-Well, it is very strange.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.533
I mean, I can't imagine
what he's thinking.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.004
Not that
you're not attractive.

01:45.037 --> 01:49.242
I feel gross, you know?
Like-- like dirty.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.780
That's ridiculous.
You can't be responsible
for what Spike thinks or feels.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.950
Well, aren't I responsible?
I mean, something about me had
to make him feel that, right?

01:56.984 --> 02:01.688
Something that
made him say, "Woof,
that's the one for me."

02:03.623 --> 02:06.694
-GILES: Buffy, I think you
should perhaps calm down.
-Me, too.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.763
Oh, Puffy Xander. Um--

02:09.795 --> 02:14.768
I'm sorry. I got--
I guess I got carried away.
Are you okay?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.038
I'm alive.
I can tell
'cause of the pain.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.040
(grunts)
Do you want to sit down?
I'm not that bendy.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.578
-I could lean.
-GILES: I'll get some ice.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.782
BUFFY: Here.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.185
(grunting)

02:31.218 --> 02:33.787
Comfy?
Oh, yeah.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.390
This leaning--
this is the stuff.
(sighs)

02:37.425 --> 02:41.662
So, that's my secret
to attracting men. You know,
it's simple, really.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.664
You slap 'em around a bit.
You torture 'em. You make
their lives a living hell and--

02:44.698 --> 02:47.167
Buff--
Sure, the nice guys,
they'll run away,

02:47.200 --> 02:50.403
but every now and
then, you'll come across a
real prince of a guy like Spike

02:50.437 --> 02:51.872
who gets off on it.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.442
Buffy, stand me up.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.611
(groans)

03:00.381 --> 03:04.784
The problem is not you.
Don't do this to yourself,
please.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.256
I just--

03:08.288 --> 03:11.157
I just wanna know
that there's gonna
be another good one,

03:11.191 --> 03:13.593
one that
I won't chase away.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.564
There will be, promise.
He's out there. He can
come along any minute.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.199
Yeah, and the minute
after that, I can
terrify him

03:20.234 --> 03:23.069
with my alarming strength
and remarkable
self-involvement.

03:23.103 --> 03:26.674
What? I don't think
you're like that.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.377
Maybe I could change.
You know, I could--
I could work harder.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.212
I could spend
less time slaying. I could
laugh at his jokes.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.748
I mean,
men like that, right?
The joke laughing at?

03:35.783 --> 03:39.387
Or maybe you could
just be Buffy. He'll
see your amazing heart,

03:39.420 --> 03:41.989
and he'll fall in love
with you.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.895
Xander, that's--
ohh.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.001
This is the day
you choose to hug me?
(sighs)

03:55.502 --> 03:57.971
Buffy?
Mm-hmm?

03:58.004 --> 04:00.774
You ever think
maybe the reason you haven't
found a great relationship

04:00.807 --> 04:04.211
on the Hellmouth
is because it's a Hellmouth?

04:04.243 --> 04:07.480
Seems to me
it's a pretty terrible place
to try to build anything.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.318
Mm.

04:11.352 --> 04:15.122
You wanna get
some coffee or something?
Yeah.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.261
(people chattering)

04:29.502 --> 04:32.406
Thank you for picking me up.
I'm very grateful for the ride.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.576
You sure you wanna
get out here? I mean,
this place is kind of--

04:36.610 --> 04:38.512
What are you looking for
in Sunnydale, anyway?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.613
True love.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.720
(theme music playing)

05:41.875 --> 05:44.244
I might like it more than
the others. Can you spin around
again?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.382
Ooh, I'm not sure.
Once more.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.353
Now, could you
go the other way?

05:56.923 --> 05:59.492
You're messing with me.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.161
We just wanted to see how many
times we could get you to do it.

06:02.194 --> 06:03.863
Was that five
or four and a half?

06:03.896 --> 06:05.733
So, is anyone gonna talk
about my dress?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.367
-I like it.
-You sure?

06:07.401 --> 06:11.338
-I mean, it's not too mom-ish?
-Oh. That was why I liked it.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.841
You're both crazy. It's not
mom-ish at all. It's sexy.

06:14.875 --> 06:19.612
It screams, "Randy sex kitten.
Buy me one drink, and I'll--"

06:19.646 --> 06:22.281
-Oh, wait. That's not
really good either.
-Uh-un.

06:22.314 --> 06:24.584
Oh, god.
What time is it?

06:25.752 --> 06:29.055
4:23. You have
lots of time until 7:00.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.225
Vast acres of time in which
you could plant crops.

06:32.259 --> 06:36.129
-Now, tell me about this Brian
and what his intentions are.
-Maybe he's a gigolo.

06:36.163 --> 06:40.067
-Was his shirt all shiny?
-No. He works for
a publishing house.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.603
-He's a nice, normal guy, okay?
-I think I've heard of those.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.305
He came to the gallery
my first day back,

06:46.338 --> 06:49.543
when I was, you know,
kind of shaky, starting over.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.579
And he asked a question
about these antique cameos.

06:51.612 --> 06:56.949
Oh, and I was so lost
because Carol had been doing
the ordering while I was sick.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.786
Well, it turned out
that he didn't know
anything about them either,

06:59.819 --> 07:01.555
so we had a lot to talk about.

07:01.588 --> 07:07.127
-So what's the plan for tonight?
-Dinner and then a movie.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.297
Or maybe it was a movie
and then dinner,

07:10.329 --> 07:15.636
which might be better because,
you know, then we could talk
about the movie.

07:15.668 --> 07:19.839
Maybe a movie isn't a good idea
at all, because you can't talk
during,

07:19.872 --> 07:21.908
and then what's the point
of any of it?

07:21.942 --> 07:26.245
Oh, and about the restaurant--
Do you think that

07:26.278 --> 07:31.184
it should be one with candles
and romantic music, or is that
pushing it?

07:31.218 --> 07:35.254
Buffy, what do you think? Should
I try to make things romantic

07:35.288 --> 07:37.456
or sort of let him
set the pace?

07:37.490 --> 07:40.259
Oh, no. Love Doctor Buffy
is not in.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.262
I am not qualified
to give dating advice.

07:43.295 --> 07:46.766
I've had exactly
two boyfriends,
and they both left.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.935
Really left.
Left town left.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.673
Honey, you just
had some bad luck.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.141
Well, you're going to that
spring break party tonight.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.476
-Maybe you'll
find someone there.
-Mm-hmm.

07:57.511 --> 08:01.514
Maybe Brian has a son, and Mom
and I can go on some unspeakably
awkward double dates.

08:01.548 --> 08:05.252
(gasping) Oh, god-- Brian.
What time is it now?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.355
4:24.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.725
-You sure
the dress is okay?
-Hm.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.862
Spin again,
real fast this time.

08:14.894 --> 08:18.064
Willow's good with
all that computer stuff,
but me not so much.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.132
Do you really
understand all that?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.702
Oh. Well, at first,
it was confusing.

08:22.735 --> 08:27.007
Just the idea
of computers was, like,
"Whoa, I'm 1,100 years old."

08:27.040 --> 08:29.843
I had trouble
adjusting to the idea
of Lutherans.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.245
I go online sometimes,
but everyone's spelling
is really bad.

08:33.279 --> 08:36.182
It's depressing.
But you have to try
online trading.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.519
It's great.
The secret is avoiding
the tech companies

08:39.552 --> 08:43.056
everyone was jumping on,
and going with
the smaller firms

08:43.090 --> 08:46.525
that supply
the basic components.
Uh-huh.

08:46.559 --> 08:50.697
Anyway, I took the money
from working for Giles,
and I tripled it.

08:50.730 --> 08:54.835
Tripled? Like, first money,
then money, money, money?
Yes.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.504
I'm thinking about buying
something very expensive,
maybe an antelope.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.174
Hi.
Hi.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.578
I'm looking for Warren. Do you
know where Warren is? And if
you do, could you tell me?

09:05.613 --> 09:09.616
Um, I don't think
we know a Warren.

09:09.649 --> 09:14.754
Well, all righty.
No harm in asking. Thanks.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.057
-Hi. Do you know Warren?
I need to find him.
-MAN: Uh, I'm sorry.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.427
You can do all this stuff
with a regular computer?

09:21.461 --> 09:25.398
I'll show you. You can also
see the website I designed
for the magic shop.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.034
Huge photo of me.

09:28.067 --> 09:32.338
(stereo: rock)
(chattering)

09:39.446 --> 09:41.581
How you doin'?
Having o' the fun?

09:41.615 --> 09:44.216
You know, I am.
Dancing with you
is way better

09:44.250 --> 09:47.220
than trying to hook up
with some good-looking guy.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.322
I think I liked it better
when you were kicking me
in my puffy groin.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.995
I let them do that.
Dance together.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.463
That was me.
Very nice of you.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.133
WILLOW: A good deed.
ANYA: Yes.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.971
I'm expecting
a big karmic reward
any second now.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.941
(giggling)

10:07.975 --> 10:11.077
Thank you.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.681
(tempo change,
 rhythmic beat)

10:31.563 --> 10:34.100
Buffy?

10:34.134 --> 10:37.136
Ben! Hey. I didn't
even know you were here.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.438
And again with
the non-medical clothing.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.408
Well, actually, these are
orthopedic pants.

10:43.043 --> 10:46.479
Man, that sounded
so funny in my head.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.282
(forced laughter)

10:49.316 --> 10:53.086
It's very, very funny.
It's funny in my head, too.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.289
Having a good time?
Yeah, I am.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.726
I was dancing earlier,
and, you know,
my friends are here, so--

10:59.759 --> 11:02.895
But, I mean, not that
it's all about me.

11:02.929 --> 11:06.499
Are you
enjoying yourself?
I am now.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.505
So, um, do you
maybe wanna dance?

11:14.774 --> 11:16.777
I'm not really good
with rhythm.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.480
Sure. I'd love to.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.851
Let me just dump this.
I'll be right back.
Okay.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.524
Look at these
tiny grain patties.

11:32.558 --> 11:36.395
They're woven.
That's craftsmanship.

11:36.428 --> 11:41.668
-(crunching)
-They aren't handwoven,
you know.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.504
-Then how?
-XANDER: Well, it's a machine,

11:45.538 --> 11:50.177
and it's--
it sort of-- it presses.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.546
And there
may be a mold
of some sort--

11:55.081 --> 11:56.984
Who's that?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.020
Warren?

12:01.053 --> 12:03.690
Oh, that girl.
Tara and I met her.

12:03.722 --> 12:07.894
She speaks with a strange
evenness and selects her words
a shade too precisely.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.931
Well, some of us like
that kind of thing
in a girl.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.232
GIRL: Warren?

12:15.836 --> 12:18.738
Hi. Did you get me a drink?
Gotta go.
She's gonna see me.

12:18.772 --> 12:23.409
She who?
What's up, Warren?
It doesn't matter. Come on.

12:23.442 --> 12:28.215
-Is Warren here?
-I thought you were
getting the crunchies.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.418
Xander got hypnotized
by the strange girl. I am
remaining calm, however.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.788
XANDER: Uh-un. No, I'm--
I'm right with you.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.190
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Here she comes.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.626
I heard that
Warren was here.
Is Warren here?

12:40.659 --> 12:43.129
Um,
Warren who?

12:43.163 --> 12:47.100
He's... Warren.
And he's looking for me.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.668
He lost me.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.342
-Is Warren here?
-It's that girl again.

12:56.375 --> 13:01.313
Is she still
looking for Warren? Weird.
It's been, like, all day.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.984
There's something
strange about her.
She talks funny.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.086
Some men
find that appealing.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.923
-Have you guys seen Warren?
-MAN: Uh, Warren?
-I just hope she finds him.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.660
Somehow, I don't think a girl
that looks like that's gonna
be lonely for too long.

13:14.693 --> 13:18.664
Definitely not.
Oh, not me. I--

13:18.697 --> 13:21.433
I was just saying
a pretty girl like that,

13:21.467 --> 13:26.239
there's always
someone lurking around,
looking for some action.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.484
Small world.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.855
Oh, dear.
If looks could stake.

13:41.889 --> 13:47.460
Are you having fun, pet?
You, uh, trolling
for your next ex?

13:47.494 --> 13:51.463
I gotta say,
you could do better.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.167
I told you I w--
Thought I was
gonna leave town?

13:54.201 --> 13:59.706
It's a free country.
Free party.

13:59.739 --> 14:05.511
If you want me to leave, you can
put your hands on my hot,
tight little body and make me.

14:07.279 --> 14:10.182
Get away from me.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.251
(sucks teeth)

14:20.759 --> 14:22.361
(sighs)

14:23.931 --> 14:25.532
Was that guy
bothering you?

14:25.565 --> 14:30.169
Should I offer to get
inappropriately violent
or something?

14:30.202 --> 14:34.908
No.
Good, 'cause, honestly,
I don't wanna.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.380
So, are you ready
to dance?

14:41.413 --> 14:44.850
Um, first--
What's that?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.220
Oh, yeah,
my phone number.

14:47.254 --> 14:51.591
I was gonna try to subtly
work it into the conversation,
but it didn't pan out,

14:51.624 --> 14:55.662
and I thought I should
try to give it to you
before you see me dance.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.570
You know,
in case you wanna
get coffee.

15:06.505 --> 15:11.410
Thank you. Um, I just--
I think you should know

15:11.443 --> 15:16.749
that I kind of
have this bad history
in which, you know,

15:16.783 --> 15:20.620
we go get coffee,
and, well, it all ends
with you leaving town--

15:20.653 --> 15:22.788
and you just got here
and everything--

15:22.822 --> 15:28.427
Apparently we'd be risking
a tragic chain reaction, but
I just really like... coffee.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.664
I think coffee
might be worth it.

15:32.698 --> 15:36.202
And I would like
to get to know
coffee better.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.975
Then I'll call you.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.183
-Have you seen Warren?
-No. Sorry.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.753
And who are you,
darling?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.922
I'm April.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.759
I'm lookin' for my fella.
Maybe you
just found him.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.961
Really? Where?

16:06.732 --> 16:07.966
Ohh!

16:09.168 --> 16:11.971
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-GIRL: That would be wrong.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.639
You are
not my boyfriend!

16:15.975 --> 16:17.177
(glass tinkling)

16:26.519 --> 16:29.389
Bloody hell.
You threw me
through a window.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.394
-What's that about?
-GIRL: You cannot make
those suggestions to me.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.865
-I have a boyfriend.
Warren is my boyfriend.
-You know what?

16:38.898 --> 16:40.866
My bleeding sympathies
to Warren.

16:43.602 --> 16:46.572
No one but Warren
can touch me.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.844
Excuse me. Hi.
Um, maybe you and I
could talk,

16:51.878 --> 16:54.547
you know, 'cause
throwing Spike
through a window--

16:54.581 --> 16:59.052
Well, that's really good.
Um, but, you know,
generally speaking--

16:59.086 --> 17:03.222
Do you know my boyfriend?
Okay, I think you
need to take a second

17:03.255 --> 17:06.925
-and stop looking
for your boyfriend.
-MAN: Hey, hey, hey.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.862
I have to find him.
(groans) Ow.

17:13.098 --> 17:16.169
If I hurt you just now,
I am sorry.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.904
And I hope
that your boyfriend
will take good care of you.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.248
Ow. I don't know
about you guys,
but I've had it

17:28.280 --> 17:30.717
with super-strong
little women who aren't me.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.452
At least she didn't
do too much damage.
XANDER: Are you kidding?

17:33.486 --> 17:38.224
Double-glazed glass
ain't cheap. And the jamb
needs to be completely repaired.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.693
Oh, dear god.
I'm the grown-up who sees
the world through my job.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.896
I'm like my uncle Dave,
the plumber, and I must
be shunned.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.634
-Okay.
-So, what do you guys
think she is?

17:48.667 --> 17:52.372
This may sound nuts, but I kind
of got the impression
that she was a--

17:52.404 --> 17:55.208
-Robot.
-XANDER: Oh, yeah. A robot.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.977
Yeah, I was gonna say robot.
What do you think she wants?

17:58.009 --> 18:01.480
-Warren, whoever that is.
-It's gotta be the guy
that built her.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.884
It's an unusual name.
There's hardly any,
except Warren Beatty

18:04.916 --> 18:07.619
and, you know,
President Harding.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.257
It-It's probably
not either of them.

18:10.289 --> 18:14.394
-Wil, can you track down this
guy with only a first name?
-Given enough time.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.463
I can get a list
of the Sunnydale students
named Warren tonight,

18:17.497 --> 18:21.500
but then we'll
have to call them
or go to their dorms,

18:21.534 --> 18:25.003
so we probably can't
start narrowing it down
till tomorrow.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.508
She could do
a lot of damage by then.
To who? Spike?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.611
See how vigorously I don't care.
She was looking for this Warren,

18:31.644 --> 18:33.180
but it didn't sound like
she wanted to hurt him.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.515
She said
he's her boyfriend.
WILLOW: I agree.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.750
I'm not sure
this is a code red.
Is there a code pink?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.188
We need more codes.
BUFFY: Okay.

18:41.221 --> 18:45.758
We'll track down Warren
tomorrow. Tonight, I better
go back and rescue Giles.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.094
He's been watching Dawn
while my mom's out
on her date.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.497
And I have a feeling there's
only so much he can take.

18:50.529 --> 18:54.099
Oh, Giles and Dawnie?
I bet they ended up
having a blast.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.538
Dear god, Buffy, there's only
so much I can take. We're gonna
have to change the system.

18:58.570 --> 19:01.240
A 14-year-old's
too old to be baby-sat,
and it's not fair on her.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.676
What'd she
make you do?
Um, well,

19:04.711 --> 19:07.213
we listened to
aggressively cheerful music
sung by people

19:07.247 --> 19:09.481
chosen for their
ability to dance.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.417
Then we ate
cookie dough and
talked about boys.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.954
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sorry,

19:15.988 --> 19:19.726
but if it makes you feel
any better, my fun-time
Buffy party night

19:19.759 --> 19:22.862
involved watching a robot
throw Spike through a window.

19:22.894 --> 19:26.398
So, if you wanna trade--
No, wait.

19:26.432 --> 19:30.836
I wouldn't give that memory
up for anything.
A robot? Sounds interesting.

19:30.869 --> 19:34.374
We're gonna work on it in
the morning-- unless you wanna
stay. Then you and I could--

19:34.406 --> 19:36.875
Who wants
to hear everything?

19:36.909 --> 19:40.747
-Listen to my mom
talk about boys.
-Right. Must go.

19:40.779 --> 19:44.384
See you tomorrow.
Bye, Joyce.
Bye, Rupert.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.520
Gosh, I'd forgotten
how much fun
dating can be.

19:48.555 --> 19:53.326
I don't know.
I was standing right here.
I didn't see Prince Charming.

19:53.359 --> 19:57.329
I didn't even see
a good-night kiss. It all
looked pretty tame to me.

19:57.364 --> 20:01.834
I suppose, by your
standards, it could
seem pretty-- Oh, dear.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.271
What?
I left my bra in his car.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.607
Mother!
I'm joking.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.544
(sighs)
Good god,
that's horrible.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.012
Don't do that.
I left it
in the restaurant.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.016
No more! No more!
No more!

20:17.048 --> 20:19.586
On the dessert cart.
I can't hear you!

20:19.618 --> 20:21.820
(knocking)

20:25.156 --> 20:28.193
Yeah? What?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.462
Hi. Does Warren
live here?

20:30.497 --> 20:33.465
What the hell?
What are you doin'? It's 3:30.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.903
Yes, it is.
Does Warren live here?

20:41.106 --> 20:44.009
Okay, then. Bye.

20:59.858 --> 21:03.261
And you're certain
she was a robot?
Absolutely.

21:03.296 --> 21:06.665
She practically had
"genuine molded plastic"
stamped on her ass.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.936
Just trying
a little spicy talk.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.638
She was looking for
someone named Warren.

21:12.672 --> 21:16.008
-Wil's already checked
the Sunnydale enrollment.
-And got nothing.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.111
I found one Warren,
but he moved out
of the country a year ago.

21:19.144 --> 21:23.516
-I'm checking nearby schools.
-Whoever he is,
he knows his stuff.

21:23.549 --> 21:27.886
That girl, well--
(chuckles)
That was a nice-looking girl.

21:30.021 --> 21:34.361
It's okay for him
to say that, 'cause I know
that he really loves me only.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.828
GILES: Is there something
the rest of us could be doing?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.965
-What can we do?
-Do you have any books
on robots?

21:39.999 --> 21:43.435
Oh, yes. Dozens. There's
an enormous amount of research
we should do before--

21:43.470 --> 21:46.673
No, I'm lying. I haven't
got squat. I just like
to see Xander squirm.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.711
Funny.
Charming and funny.

21:51.743 --> 21:55.382
Hey, I-I think
I found him.
A Warren Meers.

21:55.414 --> 21:58.884
He went to
Sunnydale High with us
for a semester,

21:58.917 --> 22:01.953
then he went
to the tech college
over in Dutton.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.356
I've got a local address
where his folks
still live.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.393
He's probably home
for spring break.

22:06.425 --> 22:10.328
Well, I'll go talk to him.
No, no. Wait. We don't know
what you're walking into.

22:10.363 --> 22:13.799
We have no idea
what his motive is
for building this thing.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.703
Um, don't you think
she's just--

22:17.737 --> 22:21.039
Yeah. She's
just sort of a--

22:21.073 --> 22:25.211
She's a "sexbot." What guy
doesn't dream about that?

22:25.243 --> 22:29.147
Beautiful girl
with no other thought
but to please you,

22:29.181 --> 22:30.717
willing to do anything.

22:36.689 --> 22:40.226
Too many girls.
I miss Oz. He'd get it.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.761
He wouldn't say anything,
but he'd get it.

22:42.795 --> 22:46.598
Why would anyone do that
if they could have
a real live person?

22:46.633 --> 22:49.669
Maybe he couldn't...
find a real person.

22:49.701 --> 22:53.506
Oh, come on. The guy's
just a big wedge of sleaze.
Don't make excuses for him.

22:53.539 --> 22:57.375
WILLOW: I'm not. I'm just saying
people get lonely.

22:57.410 --> 23:01.146
Maybe having someone around,
even someone you made up,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.750
maybe it's easier.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.752
TARA: But it's so weird.
I mean,

23:06.786 --> 23:09.955
everyone wants
a nice, normal person
to, you know, share with,

23:09.989 --> 23:15.394
but this guy-- if he
couldn't find that--
I guess it's kind of sad.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.171
(sighs)

23:33.278 --> 23:37.215
(gasping, moaning)

23:37.249 --> 23:41.453
(telephone ringing)
(gasps, grunts)

23:46.025 --> 23:50.395
-Hello?
-Hey, Ben, it's Buffy.
Is this a bad time?

23:50.429 --> 23:55.267
-I know it's kind of early.
-No, I just-- I just
got in is all.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.403
Night shift at the hospital.
I'm glad you called.

23:58.436 --> 24:01.140
Well, I found your number
in my pocket,

24:01.173 --> 24:03.476
and, you know, I figured
I'd pick up the phone
a couple times

24:03.509 --> 24:05.678
and then hang up,
and then finally call

24:05.711 --> 24:10.348
and see if maybe you wanted
to get that cup of coffee
or do whatever you wanna do.

24:10.382 --> 24:14.520
Yeah. Yes,
coffee would be great.

24:14.554 --> 24:18.490
Tomorrow night.
Sure. Bye.

24:23.529 --> 24:26.732
(sighs)
Oh, fine.

24:33.072 --> 24:37.476
But we just got here. If you
don't wanna be here, why didn't
we just stay in Dutton?

24:37.509 --> 24:39.478
Or we could've
gone to my sister's.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.682
Katrina, I don't wanna hear
about your sister's place again.
Pack your stuff now.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.717
Why the rush?
It's real early.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.019
Are we even gonna say
goodbye to your mom?
You can call her.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.222
Warren,
is something going on
you don't want me to see?

24:51.257 --> 24:54.861
Katrina, if you don't
wanna pack, that's fine.
We can buy new stuff.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.896
Now, let's just go.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.736
-I have to talk to you.
-Who's this?

25:03.769 --> 25:06.238
-Is this about her?
-Yes.

25:06.271 --> 25:10.676
Her who? Warren,
something's going on here.
Strange girls.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.880
Katrina, please be quiet,
okay? This is important.
Wait in the kitchen.

25:13.913 --> 25:18.183
And I'm not important? Warren,
just tell her to go away.
I can't.

25:18.217 --> 25:21.587
You're keeping secrets
from me-- other girls
and who knows what else.

25:21.621 --> 25:27.058
Trina, shut up.
That's it. Forget it,
Warren. I'm gone.

25:27.093 --> 25:31.196
No. Katrina! Ugh!

25:31.230 --> 25:34.432
My name is Buffy Summers. We
were at Sunnydale High together.
Do you know who I am?

25:34.465 --> 25:37.737
Yes, I know. April.
Did she hurt someone?

25:37.769 --> 25:40.372
Not yet. Well,
no one that matters.

25:40.405 --> 25:43.710
She's looking for me, you know?
She followed me here.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.613
Okay, kind of
figured that out.
No, no. There's more.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.248
There's something you need
to know about her.
I know.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.751
No, wait. This is important.
Believe me,
I worked it out.

25:52.785 --> 25:56.655
No, this is something
that you can't possibly know.

26:00.058 --> 26:04.329
She's a robot.
Uh-huh?

26:08.968 --> 26:11.637
DAWN: A robot? Really?
Was it Ted?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.873
'Cause they always said
there could've been more
than one of him.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.808
Nope. Whole new robot.
This one was a girl.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.778
Buffy's busy tracking down
the guy that made her, so I'll
drop you off at school,

26:19.811 --> 26:21.146
and if she's
not finished, then--

26:21.180 --> 26:23.849
-Coming through!
Coming through!
-(gasping)

26:26.352 --> 26:28.487
Fire, fire!

26:30.122 --> 26:33.692
(sighs)
Hello, all.
What's going on, then?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.829
Spike, you're
not welcome here.

26:37.864 --> 26:41.667
Yeah, and by the way,
we're working on a way
to de-invite you from here,

26:41.701 --> 26:43.769
even if it is
a public place.

26:43.802 --> 26:48.473
Nah, forget it. Letting him in
is good, 'cause then we get
to toss him out.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.242
Ooh, can we throw him
out the window
like the robot did?

26:51.277 --> 26:55.647
-'Cause that was neat.
-Robot? That's what she was?

26:55.682 --> 26:58.317
Huh. I knew something
wasn't right.

26:58.349 --> 27:02.621
Hey! Someone's glad to see me.
Aren't you, little bit?

27:02.654 --> 27:05.324
Stay away
from me.

27:05.356 --> 27:10.829
-I think you'd better go.
-Okay, now. I was afraid
of this.

27:10.863 --> 27:16.501
(sighs) Misrepresentations,
misunderstandings,
slurs, and allegations.

27:16.535 --> 27:19.371
I don't know
what Buffy told you,
but the thing is,

27:19.404 --> 27:22.141
Slayer and I worked together,
side by side,

27:22.173 --> 27:25.211
to get rid of Dru,
who was up to no good,
and I don't mind telling you--

27:25.243 --> 27:29.280
Spike, listen to me.
It's just--
I'm trying to explain.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.651
She might have said
some things that sounded

27:32.684 --> 27:35.988
like I expressed
some kind of feeling--

27:39.157 --> 27:42.594
We are not your friends.
We are not your way
to Buffy.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.267
There is no way to Buffy.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.372
Clear out of here.

27:53.404 --> 27:56.742
And, Spike, this thing?
Get over it.

27:59.045 --> 28:02.080
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.549
Move the hell on.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.954
(inhales sharply)

28:24.871 --> 28:28.207
-I'm looking for
my boyfriend, Warren.
-What?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.742
He comes from here,
and I need him.

28:30.777 --> 28:34.512
But it's confusing,
and I've already walked
a really long way.

28:34.546 --> 28:38.917
I'm sure he's nearby.
Oh, Warren!
You're looking for Warren?

28:38.951 --> 28:41.619
Yes! Do you know him?
Do you know where he is?

28:41.653 --> 28:44.022
Let me think.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.794
Please think.
Jeez, this is too bad.
You just missed him.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.261
Yes? Where did he go?

28:50.296 --> 28:56.035
Warren? Uh, he headed out,
uh, that way. Hurry.
You might catch him.

28:56.067 --> 29:00.105
(sighs) Thank you.
I was getting very tired.
Thank you.

29:02.508 --> 29:07.046
Who's Warren?
Hell if I know.

29:07.078 --> 29:11.150
So, you have girl troubles.
They're not talking to you.
You're not getting dates.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.986
You start thinking,
"Hey, this isn't fair."

29:14.019 --> 29:18.390
Yeah, I felt like I deserved
to have someone. Everyone
deserves to have someone.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.492
So, naturally, you
turned to manufacturing.

29:21.527 --> 29:25.230
-Kind of.
-And how long did it take to
build yourself that little toy?

29:25.263 --> 29:29.969
Oh, no. She's not a toy.
I know what you're thinking,
but she's more than that.

29:30.001 --> 29:33.138
Look, I'm sure
she has many exciting
labor-saving attachments.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.407
No. I made her
to love me.

29:36.442 --> 29:40.612
I mean, she cares
about what I care about,
and she wants to be with me.

29:40.645 --> 29:42.848
She listens to me
 and supports me.

29:42.882 --> 29:46.184
I didn't make a toy.
I made a girlfriend.

29:46.218 --> 29:51.457
A girlfriend?
Are you saying--

29:51.490 --> 29:53.659
Are you in love
with her?

29:53.692 --> 29:58.763
I really thought I would be.
I mean, she's perfect.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.268
I don't know. I guess it was
 too easy and predictable.

30:02.300 --> 30:08.140
You know, she got boring.
She was exactly what I wanted,
and I didn't want her.

30:08.173 --> 30:11.542
-I thought
I was going crazy.
-Really? You?

30:11.576 --> 30:16.481
Then something happened.
Katrina was in
my engineering seminar,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.184
and she was
really funny and cool.

30:19.218 --> 30:23.055
She was always
giving me a hard time,
real unpredictable.

30:23.088 --> 30:27.226
She builds these
little model monorails
that run with magnets and--

30:27.259 --> 30:30.896
Anyway, I fell in love
with Katrina.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.400
Swell. Romance
and magnetic trains.

30:34.432 --> 30:37.635
But first, you decided to
take April out of the box,
play with her

30:37.669 --> 30:39.471
for five minutes,
 and then what?

30:39.505 --> 30:42.407
You got bored,
 decided to dump her,
 tell her to go away?

30:42.441 --> 30:47.012
-Kind of.
-And she got mad.
She didn't go, huh?

30:47.046 --> 30:51.583
Okay, I didn't really dump her
as much as I went out
and didn't come back.

30:51.616 --> 30:55.554
I left her. I left her
in my dorm room.

30:55.586 --> 30:58.324
You left her
in your dorm room?

30:58.356 --> 31:03.229
I figured I could just get away
until her batteries gave up,
which should have been days ago.

31:03.261 --> 31:08.233
Did you even tell her?
Did you even give her a chance
to fix what was wrong?

31:08.267 --> 31:11.769
I didn't need to fix anything.
Her batteries were supposed
to run down.

31:11.803 --> 31:15.441
Really, they should
be completely dead by now.
So, why aren't they?

31:15.473 --> 31:20.078
I don't know.
Maybe-- She must be
recharging them somehow.

31:20.112 --> 31:23.182
Warren, this is important.
Is she dangerous?

31:23.214 --> 31:25.951
She's only programmed
to be in love.

31:25.984 --> 31:30.056
Then she's dangerous.
Do you have any idea
how to find her?

31:30.088 --> 31:33.459
She's looking for me,
so my guess is
she's probably pretty close.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.396
(distant chattering)

31:38.430 --> 31:42.201
Hi.
(scoffs)

31:42.233 --> 31:44.971
Do you know
where Warren is?
I need to get to Warren.

31:45.003 --> 31:47.806
This is getting insane.
How many of you are there?

31:47.838 --> 31:52.478
There's only me, April.
April?

31:52.510 --> 31:57.383
Fine. Listen up, April.
Warren is my boyfriend.
Mine.

31:57.415 --> 32:01.086
And you others probably
ought to figure that out. Ow!

32:01.119 --> 32:04.390
Ow! Let go!
Don't go.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.159
You have to stay
and tell the truth.
What?

32:08.660 --> 32:12.431
Stop.
(gasping)
You're lying.

32:12.463 --> 32:15.933
He cannot
be your boyfriend.
Say that he's my boyfriend.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.804
I can't-- (gasping)
I can't breathe.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.440
Let go.
(ribs crack)

32:21.472 --> 32:25.144
(gasping)
You have to stop lying.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.923
Bloody right,
I'll move on.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.493
April!
April, are you there?

32:42.528 --> 32:45.596
If the batteries are still
working and she hears my voice,
then she'll answer.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.134
She's voice-activated?
Well, I made it so that

32:48.166 --> 32:51.002
if she heard me and didn't
answer, it causes this kind
of feedback.

32:51.037 --> 32:54.640
Wait. If you call her
and she doesn't answer,
it hurts her?

32:54.673 --> 32:58.210
You're one creepy
little dweeb, Warren.
April!

32:58.243 --> 32:59.545
Warren.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.281
-April.
-Where have you been?

33:03.315 --> 33:06.984
I couldn't find you,
and this girl
kept lying to me,

33:07.019 --> 33:09.221
and then
she went to sleep.

33:16.994 --> 33:20.132
April, what did
you do?

33:20.165 --> 33:24.569
Please don't be angry,
Warren. I'm trying very hard
to make you happy.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.873
April, I want you
to put the girl down.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.576
Warren,
what should I do?

33:30.608 --> 33:32.943
Talk to her.
Put her down!

33:34.546 --> 33:38.284
This is Buffy.
Give Katrina to Buffy.

33:41.752 --> 33:44.455
Is she broken?

33:47.625 --> 33:51.197
-She's alive.
-Thank god.

33:51.230 --> 33:56.034
Warren, honey,
what's going on? Why did you
go away? Is it a game?

33:56.067 --> 33:59.037
No, no. This isn't a game.
Did I
do something wrong?

33:59.070 --> 34:03.409
I waited a long time,
and you never came back.
A long time.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.678
-I made you five sweaters.
-That's great. You could go
back there and get them.

34:06.711 --> 34:11.250
-So, you could wait there--
-Warren. You have to tell her.
And do it right.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.322
What is she saying, Warren?
What do you need to tell me?

34:20.925 --> 34:24.963
-April, I made a mistake.
-You can't make mistakes.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.132
No. I did.

34:27.166 --> 34:31.202
I thought that I made you
everything that I wanted--
(computer processing)

34:31.237 --> 34:33.938
But it wasn't
what I really wanted.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.777
I'm sorry,
but it's over.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.382
But I can be
whatever you want.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.652
I love you. I'll do
whatever you want.
Would you like a neck rub?

34:46.684 --> 34:51.789
No. See, I know
that you love me, but
the truth is, I can't love you.

34:51.822 --> 34:56.295
-It's not your fault,
but... I don't love you.
-(static)

34:56.327 --> 34:59.130
(warning signal)
I love her.

35:00.666 --> 35:04.269
-(growling)
-She growls?

35:04.302 --> 35:06.637
-You made her
so she growls?
-Well, I--

35:26.891 --> 35:29.527
-(short-circuiting)
-What's going on?
-WARREN: No, no, Trina.

35:29.561 --> 35:30.829
Get away.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.708
What is-- What--
That's a robot.

35:42.740 --> 35:47.278
She wasn't just for sex.
Is that-- Is that
your ex-girlfriend?

35:47.313 --> 35:50.181
(stammering)
No. Get the hell
away from me!

35:50.215 --> 35:52.851
No, no, no, Trina. No.
Trina, wait. Listen to me. No.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.028
(short-circuiting)

36:11.536 --> 36:14.405
You took my man.
I'm going to kill you.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.675
I'm going to--

36:16.708 --> 36:19.777
(high-pitched tone)
I can't-- can't crush--

36:20.911 --> 36:23.914
(gasping)
So... tired.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.585
(grunts, coughs)
Warren?

36:27.619 --> 36:30.356
Where are you?

36:30.389 --> 36:34.460
(mechanical whirring,
slowing)
what's happening to me?

36:39.231 --> 36:42.701
Can you cry?
Sometimes I feel better
when I cry.

36:42.733 --> 36:46.237
But there might
be rust issues.
Crying is blackmail.

36:46.271 --> 36:49.807
Good girlfriends
don't cry.
Oh.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.579
I've rechecked
everything.

36:53.612 --> 36:58.115
I did everything
I was supposed to do.
I was a good girlfriend.

36:58.148 --> 37:01.018
I'm sure you were.

37:01.052 --> 37:06.891
I'm only supposed
to love him. If I can't
do that, what am I for?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.626
What do I exist for?

37:10.128 --> 37:15.099
I don't know.
It isn't fair.
He wasn't fair to you.

37:18.068 --> 37:22.273
It's getting dark.
It's so early
to be dark.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.143
Yeah.

37:27.978 --> 37:31.081
What if he comes back
and he can't find me
in the dark?

37:31.115 --> 37:34.119
I'm here. I'll make sure
that he finds you.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.224
Maybe this is
a girlfriend test.

37:40.257 --> 37:44.128
If I wait here
patiently this time,
he'll come back.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.565
I'm sure he will.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.603
And he'll-- he'll tell you
how sorry he is.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.507
You know, he told me
how proud he was of you

37:56.541 --> 37:59.677
and how impressed he was
with how much you loved him

37:59.710 --> 38:01.179
and how you tried
to help him.

38:02.547 --> 38:05.016
He didn't
mean to hurt you.

38:05.050 --> 38:09.186
He's going to take me home,
and things'll be right
again.

38:10.822 --> 38:13.759
It'll be fine.

38:13.791 --> 38:18.963
When things are sad,
you just have to be patient,

38:18.996 --> 38:20.898
because--

38:22.568 --> 38:26.871
because every cloud
has a silver lining.

38:28.206 --> 38:32.510
And when life
gives you lemons,

38:32.543 --> 38:34.713
make lemonade.

38:36.681 --> 38:41.119
Clouds and lemonade, huh?
Yes.

38:41.152 --> 38:46.190
And-- And things are...
(mechanical sputtering)

38:46.224 --> 38:50.161
(voice lowering and slowing)
always darkest...

38:50.195 --> 38:54.099
before--
(mechanical whirring
peters out)

39:25.764 --> 39:29.534
See, you construct
the wood jamb and frame
the glass into it,

39:29.568 --> 39:31.670
and that's what you set
into the opening.

39:31.702 --> 39:36.442
-Yeah?
-One of the cool things
about that, you see,

39:36.474 --> 39:41.346
is the jamb can be
shimmed to be square,
even if the opening isn't.

39:41.378 --> 39:45.851
Shimmed? Is that even
a real word? Do you have any
idea what you're talking about?

39:45.884 --> 39:50.588
Yeah, I do.
Scary, isn't it?

39:50.621 --> 39:54.626
I think I've actually turned
into someone you want around
after a crazed robot attack.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.929
And if you ever start
your own business, you'll
have your slogan right there.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.469
-And she wasn't crazed.
-Yeah?

40:05.436 --> 40:09.574
She devoted everything
to making this
one person happy.

40:09.608 --> 40:15.447
And then it was like with him
gone, there was just no reason
for her to exist anymore.

40:15.481 --> 40:18.784
Robots are
the strangest people.

40:18.817 --> 40:23.121
No. People are
the strangest people.

40:23.153 --> 40:26.891
I mean, look at me
obsessing about being
with someone.

40:26.925 --> 40:31.161
It's, like, I don't
need a guy right now.

40:31.195 --> 40:33.331
I need me.

40:33.364 --> 40:37.402
I need to get comfortable
being alone with Buffy.

40:37.434 --> 40:41.271
Well, I'll say this--
she's a pretty cool person
to be alone with.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.641
Thank you.

40:57.021 --> 41:02.628
Hi. It's Buffy. Um,
I hope this is your machine.
There wasn't a message.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.963
Anyway, um, about coffee--

41:05.996 --> 41:09.199
I, um-- I just--

41:09.233 --> 41:15.106
I don't think this
is the best time for me
to be drinking... coffee.

41:15.139 --> 41:20.378
(over machine)
Um, I'm sorry.
And, um, bye.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.880
(line clicks off)
What the hell?

41:22.914 --> 41:25.851
If I may, your
inconceivableness,

41:25.884 --> 41:29.487
it sounds to
these humble ears
like our Ben

41:29.521 --> 41:31.690
tried to make a date
with the Slayer.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.695
A date with the Slayer?

41:37.896 --> 41:39.697
No, no, no, no, no.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.568
He is planning something.
He's working against me.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.206
She turned us down?

41:49.239 --> 41:52.878
Trina-- No, wait.
Listen. I'm so sorry.

41:52.911 --> 41:56.414
Yes, I am s--
No, no. Just give me
a chance to explain.

41:56.447 --> 42:00.150
Yes! No, but she-- No, no.
Listen. I'll do anything.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.519
Just-- No, no!
Don't hang up!

42:09.527 --> 42:13.530
(yells)
How did you get in here?
Your mum let me in.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.768
I'm placing an order.

42:16.802 --> 42:19.737
Oh, no. I'm not
making any more girls.
Sure, you are.

42:21.106 --> 42:22.407
Here's your specs.

42:25.643 --> 42:28.914
You're gonna
make her real good for me.

42:32.617 --> 42:35.954
Hey, Mom. Oh.

42:41.992 --> 42:46.731
Still a couple
of guys gettin' it right.

42:46.764 --> 42:51.769
Hey, flower-getting lady,
want me to pick Dawn up
from school?
