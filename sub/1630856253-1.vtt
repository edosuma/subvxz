WEBVTT

00:16.884 --> 00:19.787
* It's that time of year

00:19.853 --> 00:23.057
* When Santa comes
to bring that cheer *

00:23.091 --> 00:26.227
* He ain't comin'
by boat or plane *

00:26.260 --> 00:29.563
* He's loaded down
with candy canes *

00:29.563 --> 00:33.901
* I only hope he keeps
one open seat *

00:33.934 --> 00:35.403
* Oh yeah

00:36.370 --> 00:38.572
* Come on Santa,
bring those toys *

00:38.572 --> 00:40.541
Sorry! Ooh, sorry!

00:40.574 --> 00:42.910
* For the girls and boys
Come on, Santa *

00:42.943 --> 00:44.044
Sorry!

00:45.079 --> 00:46.247
Okay.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.319
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.588
Hmm.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.425
* Let's hope
the weather's good *

00:57.425 --> 00:58.559
Ugh!

01:01.129 --> 01:02.896
Oh, sorry!

01:04.432 --> 01:07.801
* But this year
he's gonna use the door *

01:09.002 --> 01:10.238
Sorry!

01:14.408 --> 01:15.609
* Come on, Santa

01:15.609 --> 01:16.844
Whoop!

01:17.445 --> 01:18.846
Ah!

01:21.115 --> 01:23.851
* The only thing I need
Come on, Santa *

01:23.917 --> 01:27.455
* Is my baby on Christmas Eve

01:28.989 --> 01:31.024
Come on, Santa!

01:31.959 --> 01:33.161
Ugh!

01:33.194 --> 01:35.863
* I wrote a letter
and tried to explain *

01:35.929 --> 01:38.166
* I sent it Santa Mail
on a North Pole train *

01:38.199 --> 01:39.500
Thank you very much.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.136
* It wasn't a list,
the only thing it said was *

01:42.136 --> 01:45.373
* She's about this tall
And her lips are ruby red *

01:45.973 --> 01:47.175
* She doesn't take much room

01:47.208 --> 01:48.976
* It's just one seat

01:49.009 --> 01:50.211
Lucy!

01:50.978 --> 01:53.147
Oh, he came!

01:53.147 --> 01:55.015
When you asked me to bring
your delivery to work,

01:55.048 --> 01:57.185
you didn't think to mention
it was a life-sized Santa?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.552
And ruin the surprise?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.888
He's gonna help us win
best decorated office this year.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.656
You know, I don't love
dragging a fully grown man

02:02.690 --> 02:04.525
around the streets,
even if it is Santa.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.898
Oh, he is just perfect.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.333
Okay, what do you think?

02:12.333 --> 02:15.068
Does he look happy by the door
or should I move him?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.904
- Juliet? This is important.
- Hm?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.406
How does he look?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.007
Who, Santa?
He looks like Santa.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.909
I just have to write this e-mail.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.545
We can't let Gerald
from accounting win again.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.680
So, take these decorations
and help me out.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.582
No, no, no, I can't.
I have a meeting with marketing

02:28.649 --> 02:30.318
in 10 minutes about
our new yoga mats.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.986
Well, you better be fast!

02:33.487 --> 02:35.155
Okay.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.226
So, uh, where did you disappear
to so early this morning?

02:38.259 --> 02:41.161
Oh, breakfast with Felix,

02:41.195 --> 02:43.264
the guy I met at Christmas
trivia last week.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.399
- A second date?
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.602
You and I are both gonna spend
Christmas with someone special this year.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.173
Uh yeah, I'm gonna tell you
something,

02:53.207 --> 02:55.175
but I really don't want you
to freak out.

02:55.209 --> 02:59.046
No words of consolation,
no sad eyes.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.015
You're doing it already
and I haven't even said anything yet.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.551
You broke it off
with Lewis, didn't you?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.619
- No, no, I didn't break it off.
- Oh, good!

03:05.686 --> 03:07.555
I just evolved right out
of the relationship.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.723
- I grew and moved through it--
- And you broke up with him.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.059
Yeah, I broke up with him,
but it was for the best.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.627
We had nothing in common.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.196
I had put together
a spreadsheet and-- - No, you didn't.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.466
Yes, of course, I did.
And it was clear on paper that

03:18.532 --> 03:21.134
we were just headed
in different directions.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.238
Okay. Well, who are you gonna
spend Christmas with this year?

03:24.238 --> 03:25.739
I don't know.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.309
Mom and Dad are
taking a cruise, so...

03:28.376 --> 03:30.077
Spend it with me and my family?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.313
Oh, my parents only live
an hour away.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.581
We'll make it fun.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.215
We'll make a road trip
out of it.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.551
You can sleep on the floor
of my childhood bedroom.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.052
Oh, please say yes!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.754
- Yes. Thank you.
- Oh!

03:40.788 --> 03:42.590
- You're the best.
- Aw!

03:42.590 --> 03:44.592
- Okay, now keep working.
- But I have five minutes.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.560
Okay. Can you put
a gold one on the top?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.729
You're directing me?
I'm trying to help you.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.764
We're trying to win
first place. First place!

03:50.798 --> 03:52.733
We wanna win, we wanna win.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.403
I'll go ask reception
for more tinsel.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.439
I love what
you've done, but do you have

03:58.439 --> 04:00.674
- any spare gold tinsel?
- Um...

04:00.741 --> 04:03.411
Hilda! I thought you left
for Palm Springs already.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.512
Change of plans.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.179
I've been on the phone
with the board.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.248
Talking them down off a cliff.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.351
Do you have a moment?

04:10.418 --> 04:11.419
Yes.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.124
No! No.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.791
Sorry, uh, Lucy went
a little overboard.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.461
I will move him.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.131
So, you were saying
the board's in a panic?

04:24.131 --> 04:25.165
To put it mildly.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.801
Sales are down 15%
from last year.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.603
Oh, well, that is worrying.
Although,

04:29.637 --> 04:31.505
the landscape has changed.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.174
We were the first
direct-to-consumer wellness and lifestyle brand

04:34.207 --> 04:36.710
and now, the market's crowded.
It makes sense sales are down.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.547
But the board wants a new
strategy to increase sales.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.181
Not a post-mortem.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.351
Did you tell them all
the strategies we have in place?

04:43.384 --> 04:46.153
All the strategies that
aren't working? Of course not.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.389
- Of course not.
- But I did tell them

04:48.456 --> 04:51.392
about a new product drop coming
before Christmas,

04:51.459 --> 04:54.728
designed to drive traffic to
the website and increase sales.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.164
I don't know anything
about that. What is it?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.166
That's up to you.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.501
I don't follow.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.471
There is no product. Yet.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.673
- That's where you come in.
- Come in and do what exactly?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.409
To develop a small product
drop before Christmas.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.178
Wait, wait... this Christmas?

05:11.178 --> 05:13.180
Like the Christmas that's in
two weeks from now?

05:13.180 --> 05:16.316
'Cause normally,
it takes months, even years

05:16.350 --> 05:18.419
to develop a p... product.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.220
It's not
a full-product launch,

05:20.253 --> 05:22.590
it's just a very small,
one-off drop.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.358
That's still a lot of work.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.860
We need to create
a scarcity mindset.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.697
Now, they'll probably find
the product sold out,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.432
but while they're on our site,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.867
they will find something else
that they need.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.537
Do you wanna take notes?
Because this is marketing gold I'm giving you.

05:36.570 --> 05:41.575
Yes, um, so, a new,
highly sought after-product by Christmas.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.445
Something that oozes luxury.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.381
Something people have
not seen before.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.550
Okay. I uh...

05:49.550 --> 05:51.218
- This won't be easy.
- Hmm.

05:51.251 --> 05:54.422
But if you can pull it off,
the Senior VP job will be yours.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.691
Wow! Okay.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.359
You can... you can count on me.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.694
- Great.
- Yeah.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.396
I will see you at 5:00
for your pitch.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.798
- 5 p.m. today?
- That's right.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.700
Oh.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.802
I like him there.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.738
He looks happy.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.382
Mm...

06:29.790 --> 06:32.660
* Merry Christmas, baby

06:35.262 --> 06:38.832
* Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year *

06:38.899 --> 06:40.601
Okay.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.335
Ugh!

06:44.572 --> 06:47.608
* Merry Christmas, baby

06:49.242 --> 06:54.682
* Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year *

06:56.784 --> 06:58.285
Ugh!

06:58.285 --> 07:01.755
* And when you tell me
that you love me **

07:01.789 --> 07:04.492
How's the brainstorm...ing?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.427
Oh, what do you need?
Tea? Green juice?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.929
Something very deep-fried?

07:08.962 --> 07:12.199
How am I supposed to come up
with a pitch by 5 p.m. today?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.635
I-I-I gotta get outta here.
I can't think in here.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
I'll be back at 5:00.
Wish me luck!

07:16.269 --> 07:17.538
Uh, where are you going?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.473
To get inspired.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.641
Hmm.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.857
This one was a long time
in the making.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.259
I took years to perfect
the balance of scents.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.328
Wow, I had no idea
candle making was such a science.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.830
Oh, yeah, it really is.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.668
Here, that's leather,
cardamom, and sandalwood.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.738
That's beautiful.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.707
It's our most iconic candle.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.948
Oh, that smells like
<i>e ChÃ¢teau des Fleurs</i> in Paris. <i>l</i>

08:35.015 --> 08:37.517
It should. It was made
especially for that hotel.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.553
Unbelievable, I recognized it!

08:39.553 --> 08:41.288
That was... 10 years ago.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.923
Not that hard to believe,
actually.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.726
Scent is an incredibly powerful
trigger for memory,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.895
and unlike our other sense,

08:47.895 --> 08:49.630
it travels directly to the part
of our brain

08:49.697 --> 08:50.631
that activates emotions.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.069
Oh!

08:56.069 --> 08:57.871
Oh. Oh, easy. Easy there.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.573
Uh... oh, my goodness.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.974
I am so sorry.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.475
Uh, are you all right?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.412
Yes! I-I'm fine,
I'm just a little embarrassed.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.414
Uh, I will pay for any damage.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.918
Uh, it doesn't look like
anything's broken, just a mess.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.320
Easily fixed.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.323
Can I help you with anything?
Did you wanna buy "Dreamy Eyes"?

09:16.757 --> 09:17.925
What did you call me?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.761
Not you, the... the candle.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.095
It's, um...

09:22.596 --> 09:23.931
it's called Dreamy Eyes.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.498
Oh.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
The candle's called Dreamy Eyes.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.437
When I thought I couldn't get
more embarrassed. Um...

09:30.437 --> 09:32.740
no, I should go.
But thank you.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.642
And I'm really sorry.
But thank you.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.778
And uh, I'm... I'm very sorry.
But thank you.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.413
And thank you.
Uh, thank you!

09:59.633 --> 10:00.934
You're late.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.671
You missed the staff
Christmas treat.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.373
Sorry. I got lost in time.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.441
That's all right.
I got you one.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.010
Oh.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.013
It smells just like Christmas.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.382
Which leads me to my pitch.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.817
Scented candles.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.986
I'm not talking about
ordinary candles.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.823
- I wanna make memory candles.
- I'm listening.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.525
All right, so today, I was
feeling really stressed out,

10:25.558 --> 10:27.995
like a lot of our customers do
every day, and I wandered into

10:28.028 --> 10:30.831
this candle store and I found
a candle that smelt

10:30.864 --> 10:33.566
just like my grandma Minnie's
house on Christmas morning.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.002
Took me straight back.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.872
I could feel my grandma's kiss
on my cheek and...

10:38.906 --> 10:42.676
and smell her perfume mingled
with dinner cooking in the oven.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.545
It was all the love and joy
of that morning

10:45.578 --> 10:47.681
just came rushing back.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.016
Changed my whole day.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.051
That sounds like
quite a candle.

10:51.084 --> 10:56.990
I wanna make chic, beautifully
packaged memory scent candles,

10:57.024 --> 11:00.728
giving our customers the gift of
a joyful Christmas memory.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.832
I like it. Original. Quirky.

11:04.865 --> 11:09.703
But how will these candles be
exclusive? A must-have item?

11:09.703 --> 11:11.571
Well, I found
this incredible candlemaker

11:11.604 --> 11:13.173
and his brand with
the Goodwell could be

11:13.206 --> 11:15.542
an amazing collaboration.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.543
Hmm.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.581
You have one week to put
a sample pack together.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.617
If I like what I see,
we'll start the marketing campaign

11:24.684 --> 11:27.554
and launch a small batch
a week later.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.191
If website traffic increases,
the position is yours.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.793
We'll increase traffic.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.963
Well, that sounds perfect,
then.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.965
Oh, one last thing.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.134
Who is this mysterious
artisan candlemaker?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.737
You'll have to wait and see!

11:53.713 --> 11:55.148
-Hey, Tom!
- Daddy!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117
Hey! How was
the Christmas market?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.486
We bought so much candy.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.589
- Maya.
- What? I am the fun aunt.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.924
It is my job.
Hmm.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.625
- How's your day been?
- Slow.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.761
- Any sales?
- A couple.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.663
When Catherine and I
first opened, we'd be out of stock by mid-December.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.800
Well, maybe everyone's putting
off their Christmas shopping.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.234
I know I am.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.904
As a matter of fact, Olive and I
are gonna head out now.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.671
Oh, before you do, Olive,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.808
do you wanna pick a candle
for Mom this year?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.943
- Yeah.
- Okay, off you go.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.127
This one because
when I smell it,

12:40.127 --> 12:42.095
it makes me remember my mom.

12:43.864 --> 12:44.965
It's perfect.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.534
- Come on, kiddo.
- Okay.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.536
- See you later.
- Bye. - Bye, Dad.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.814
So, tomorrow, I'm
going back to the candle store

13:00.848 --> 13:02.682
to make the candle guy
a proposal.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.717
- Is he hot?
- Lucy.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.787
What? He's a candle guy,
so he's gotta be hot.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.991
Like a burning flame with
smouldering good looks.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.160
- See what I did there?
- Can we stay on topic?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.194
And it's Christmas.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.795
Anything is possible
at Christmas.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.664
Great! How about launching
a brand new product

13:17.664 --> 13:19.900
to help drive traffic to
the website? Is that possible?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.801
- I don't know about that.
- Stop it.

13:21.835 --> 13:22.870
I'm kidding!

13:22.903 --> 13:24.237
You're the most organized,
efficient,

13:24.304 --> 13:25.839
hard-working person I know.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.875
So, if anyone can do it,
you can. - Thank you.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.711
I just need to work around
the clock. And I need the candle guy to say yes.

13:31.744 --> 13:35.015
A big corporation is taking
his candles to the world.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.683
Of course he'll say yes.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.051
No.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.752
No?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.221
Yeah, no.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.690
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.192
I mean, it's an original idea,

13:45.225 --> 13:46.826
I'm just not interested
in a collaboration.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.062
Oh, so you like the idea,
but you're not interested.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.998
Well, two things can be
true at the same time.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.700
Wa... wait.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.869
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:55.869 --> 13:57.270
Hi, again.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.240
I don't mean to pry, but most
small business owners

14:00.273 --> 14:02.175
dream of an opportunity
like this.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.044
- Not me.
- Can I ask why?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.847
- Do you want me to be honest?
- Of course.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.616
I don't think
your idea's doable

14:09.682 --> 14:12.385
and I'm really not interested in
cheap, mass-produced gimmicks.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.922
Uh, "cheap gimmicks"?
No, no, no, no.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.390
This would be a small,
exclusive drop.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.093
I didn't mean to offend you
and I appreciate your offer,

14:20.127 --> 14:22.062
but I need to protect
my brand's integrity.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.297
Right. 'Cause creating
candles with me

14:24.364 --> 14:26.934
would taint your brand
and damage your integrity.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.136
No, that came out wrong.
I...

14:29.736 --> 14:32.072
It's just not for me.
I'm sorry.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.907
All right.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.286
Lucy said you met
with the candlemaker.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.156
Yes, that is exactly what
I was doing. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.257
Did you give him the contract?

14:50.290 --> 14:51.824
Um...

14:51.891 --> 14:52.993
Not... not quite yet.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.262
I'm... I'm working on it.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.897
Better get moving.
Time is of the essence.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.266
Yeah.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.408
He's arrogant, and pretentious,

15:08.441 --> 15:11.278
and opinionated,
and self-absorbed.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.746
He's also like, really tall.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.115
Do you know how
annoying that is?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.950
So then, kick him to the curb

15:16.950 --> 15:18.685
and find a new supplier.
Solved.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.820
But I've done my research.
His candles can be seen

15:20.853 --> 15:23.123
in boutique hotels
and style magazines.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.959
His brand is just what we need.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.828
But you know
so many influencers.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.363
Why don't you just find
a new style icon?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.465
'Cause he's more
than just a brand.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.368
His candles are... incredible.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.769
I can't explain it.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.338
All I know is
an ordinary candlemaker

15:38.371 --> 15:41.774
can't recreate these complex
nuanced scents like he can.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.811
So, how are you gonna
change this new, cool,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.713
extraordinary
candlemaker's mind?

15:46.779 --> 15:47.814
I'm not.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.116
He made it pretty clear
he wants

15:49.149 --> 15:50.950
nothing to do with me.

15:50.984 --> 15:54.287
I'm just gonna have to come up
with a better idea, and fast.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.223
Mm-hmm. Before you do that,

15:56.289 --> 15:57.724
can you make this bow for me?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.326
Thank you!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.494
- I hear you.
- Mm-hmm?

16:01.494 --> 16:02.395
Yeah, yeah.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.031
I'm totally listening.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.165
- Are you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.067
Okay.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.174
Where'd the star disappear to?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.809
- Uh, to the end of the table.
- Oh.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.980
Who's Juliet Sweeney?

16:21.014 --> 16:22.515
No idea.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.154
Oh, uh, she stopped by
the store today

16:27.187 --> 16:29.156
and asked me to collaborate
with her company, the Goodwell.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.391
The Goodwell are huge!

16:31.424 --> 16:33.193
That's amazing! Congratulations!

16:33.226 --> 16:34.494
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.030
What? Why not?
You said things were slow.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.999
They are, but business
will pick up. - And if it doesn't?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.235
Look, I'm not partnering
with another company again.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.536
Not after last time.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.839
- Well, that was different.
- No, it's the same.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.841
They offered me a bunch of money
to collaborate,

16:48.875 --> 16:50.543
ripped me off, and left
the business in tatters.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.945
Well, that last part hasn't
happened this time.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.547
Yeah, yet.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.119
- Oh, Mom's calling.
- Oh, put it on speaker.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.788
Hi, Mom.
I'm here with Maya.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.457
- <i>: Hi!</i>
- Hello, my darlings.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.858
How are Christmas
preparations coming?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.560
Well, we're just decorating
the tree right now.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.797
It'll look like
a winter wonderland in here

17:10.863 --> 17:12.232
<i>by the time you arrive.</i>

17:14.233 --> 17:15.568
Mom, you still there?

17:17.569 --> 17:21.407
I... I'm sorry, I'm just
a little overwhelmed.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.276
I've got a lot of folks
down there

17:23.310 --> 17:25.377
<i>packing family charity boxes.</i>

17:26.113 --> 17:27.480
200 down!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.249
2,000 to go.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.452
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>we lost our major donor.</i>

17:33.120 --> 17:34.421
<i>Things are very tight.</i>

17:34.421 --> 17:36.956
<i>I can't hire more helpers</i>
<i>without a donor.</i>

17:37.324 --> 17:39.426
And if I don't lend a hand,

17:39.426 --> 17:42.129
we're not going to get
the family boxes out in time for Christmas.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.297
You didn't tell us
you lost a donor.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.599
Well, I was hoping
to find one quickly,

17:46.599 --> 17:49.001
but it... it didn't
work out that way.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.304
<i>Which is... is why I called.</i>

17:51.338 --> 17:55.475
I... I'm so sorry, but I'm not
going to be able to make it

17:55.508 --> 17:56.609
to see you at Christmas.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.446
Oh no, Mom. Really?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.614
I... I don't know how
I can leave.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.017
<i>I've got people working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:06.953
<i>I mean, this is my charity.</i>

18:06.953 --> 18:08.455
<i>II've run it for 20 years</i>

18:08.455 --> 18:10.623
and I hope to run it
for another 20.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.425
I need to be here.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.960
Of course you do.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.529
We'll miss you, that's all.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.298
<i>Well, we can videoconference</i>

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
all day long.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.468
That way, I won't miss a thing.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.637
It'll be like
I'm right there with you.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.975
Now, can you please get
my beautiful granddaughter

18:29.008 --> 18:31.311
- <i>so I can tell her?</i>
- Oh, it's okay, Mom.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.646
<i>he's at a friend's for dinner.S</i>
<i>But I'll tell her.</i>

18:33.646 --> 18:36.483
<i>Just um... you get back to it,</i>
<i>okay? Love you.</i>

18:36.516 --> 18:38.050
Love you!
Bye!

18:41.154 --> 18:43.223
You can put the star on.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.158
You're taller.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.334
I don't understand!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.035
Does she not wanna see me?

18:56.068 --> 18:57.304
Oh, of course, she does.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.538
Then, what is it?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.174
Well, it's... it's kind
of hard to explain.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.675
It's grown-up stuff.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.212
I hate grown-up stuff.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.513
But Grandma loves you.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.215
And so do Maya and I,

19:08.248 --> 19:11.017
and we're gonna make sure you
have the best Christmas ever.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.385
Okay?

19:12.419 --> 19:13.920
'Kay, Dad.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.087
Okay.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.323
It's time for sleep now, kiddo.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.557
Night.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.025
Night, Dad.

19:19.025 --> 19:19.992
Night, sweetie.

19:39.078 --> 19:43.950
Bring Grandma here
for Christmas.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.068
How'd she take it?

20:02.101 --> 20:05.071
Uh, she'll be okay.
You know, kids are flexible.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.073
Are those my accounts?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.741
They were just
sitting on the table.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.444
- Maya!
- You said things were a little slow.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.745
They are a little slow.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.714
It's worse than that
and you know it!

20:14.747 --> 20:16.316
You can't just put
your head in the sand.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.418
I'm not putting my head
in the sand,

20:18.451 --> 20:20.420
I am focusing on
what I'm good at,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.289
which is making
beautiful candles, okay?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.257
The rest will just work
itself out.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.725
No, it won't.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.896
You need to work it out,
with the Goodwell.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.751
I need an update on
the candle project.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.353
Yes, uh, for sure. Of course.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.188
Um, great news, actually.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.992
The project has evolved into
something different, better.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.329
Instead of candles, uh...

21:02.362 --> 21:03.596
I greenlit candles.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.665
Why are you moving in
a different direction?

21:05.698 --> 21:08.167
Uh, well, the truth is...

21:08.200 --> 21:10.337
the candle supplier is...

21:11.604 --> 21:12.639
Right here.

21:14.341 --> 21:17.477
Uh, Hilda, this is...

21:18.378 --> 21:20.046
Tom Turner.
Tom Turner.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.148
Pleased to meet you, Tom.
I'm Hilda Holstein.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.351
I'm the CEO and founder
of the Goodwell.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.286
Juliet and I were just
about to go over

21:27.320 --> 21:30.523
some preliminary numbers
if you'd like to join us?

21:30.557 --> 21:32.024
Budgets already?

21:32.492 --> 21:35.194
Ugh. Supplier issue.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.296
I gotta go.
We'll talk tomorrow.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.165
- Tom.
- Absolutely!

21:43.336 --> 21:44.537
Nice Santa.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.340
Thank you. Yeah,
he's a real asset.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.346
Do you have time to talk?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.181
Sure.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.851
Look, the truth is, it's hard
for me to trust a company

21:58.851 --> 22:01.220
that got rich selling
detoxes and crystals

22:01.253 --> 22:02.655
- to vulnerable people.
- You make us sound

22:02.689 --> 22:04.657
- like a bunch of criminals.
- No, not at all.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.192
I mean, none of it
is technically illegal,

22:06.192 --> 22:07.760
just immoral and...

22:07.827 --> 22:10.096
All right, just stop.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.500
Did you just call me out
of a meeting just to trash me and my company again?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.735
No, I came because I realized

22:15.768 --> 22:18.204
that my business needs
rejuvenation

22:18.237 --> 22:19.672
and I should take a risk.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.574
With you.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.510
So, you want to work together?

22:23.543 --> 22:25.277
Well, I don't know if "want"
is the right word,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.779
but I think I need to.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.348
And what makes you think that
I still wanna invest in you

22:29.382 --> 22:31.451
when you think so little of me
and my company?

22:31.518 --> 22:34.454
I have a feeling you think
me and my candles are worth it.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.724
What do you say? We got a deal?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.727
I'll send you the contract.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.895
Deal.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.606
Thank you.
And have a merry Christmas.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.644
So? How did it go?

22:58.310 --> 23:01.313
You're looking at
the new Goodwell collaborator.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.782
Good for you!

23:03.416 --> 23:05.785
I feel I'm gonna be sick
to my stomach.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.420
Oh, come on,
it's not that bad.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.756
The Goodwell has
a great reputation. - Mm-hmm.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.425
It's sustainable, high end.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.261
Or maybe just think
about the money.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.730
It's a great opportunity
for the business.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.599
We'll see.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.238
Is there a line of
candlemakers in your family?

23:26.272 --> 23:29.609
-Uh...
- I bet your candles are woodsy.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.777
Yeah, some of them.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.779
How long does it take
to make a candle?

23:32.779 --> 23:34.781
Oh, Juliet!

23:34.781 --> 23:36.182
Your candlemaker's here.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.517
You can just call me Tom.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.486
Sure, candlemaker Tom.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.853
Okay, thank you, Lucy.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.189
I'll let you know if
we need anything else.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
Mm-hmm.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.961
- Morning.
- Oh, is it still morning? I've been here for hours.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.663
Yeah, it's 10 a.m.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.532
I like to start at
8:00 at the latest.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.833
Ah.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.468
- Shall we get started?
- Sure!

23:55.502 --> 23:57.837
Great! I'd like to begin
by telling you a little bit

23:57.870 --> 24:00.439
about the Goodwell, just
to dispel any misconceptions

24:00.473 --> 24:01.774
or preconceived ideas
you might have.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.309
Is that really necessary?

24:03.342 --> 24:05.277
I'm not sure I need to know
all the ins and outs.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.213
The Goodwell
was founded in 1992

24:07.279 --> 24:09.882
by our visionary CEO,
Hilda Holstein.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.786
It was the first
direct-to-consumer wellness and lifestyle brand.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.322
The Goodwell was
the first company of its kind

24:16.355 --> 24:18.357
to harness the power
of social media.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.561
And today we are
the second-largest wellness company in the marketplace.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.663
Any questions?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.999
- Tom?
- Hmm? Yep.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.467
Questions?

24:28.501 --> 24:29.702
Yeah, can we get outta here?

24:29.736 --> 24:31.738
I think this lighting
is dulling my senses.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.472
Uh, no, not... not yet.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.841
I can call in some lunch

24:34.841 --> 24:37.877
or get some coffee,
tea, activated water. That--

24:37.910 --> 24:39.512
I need some air.
I'll be back soon.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.747
Wait, Tom, where are you...

24:40.813 --> 24:42.815
where are you going? Wait.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.350
Wait!

24:47.854 --> 24:49.822
Tom, wait!

24:52.024 --> 24:53.526
Tom, wait!

24:53.526 --> 24:55.427
You can't just storm out
of a meeting!

24:55.494 --> 24:56.696
I didn't storm, I strolled.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.397
I was in the middle
of a presentation.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.532
Look, if we're gonna work
together,

24:59.532 --> 25:00.833
we need to communicate
clearly

25:00.867 --> 25:02.535
and respect each other's time.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.271
We also need to work
in a space where we can be creative.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.007
- Not in there.
- In there, meaning my office.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.676
Yeah, how do you think
in that place?

25:09.709 --> 25:12.344
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.

25:12.378 --> 25:15.882
Look, you want me to make
something special and beautiful,

25:15.915 --> 25:17.850
then we need to be in
an inspirational space

25:17.884 --> 25:20.286
- for it to come to life.
- Like where?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.520
Why not my shop?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.590
No! I need to be
in the office.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.692
Look, it's not just
about creating beauty,

25:25.725 --> 25:27.794
it's about crunching numbers
and understanding customers

25:27.860 --> 25:29.562
and those things are important!

25:29.596 --> 25:31.063
Okay, what if we split
our time?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.065
We can finish today
at your office and then,

25:33.099 --> 25:34.466
tomorrow, we're on my turf.

25:37.436 --> 25:38.404
Fine.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.974
Oh.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.377
Christmas is a time for giving.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.314
Wow, that's very generous.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.916
Don't sound so surprised.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.983
Come on.

25:58.424 --> 26:01.594
Well, here are some designs
our team have come up with.

26:04.496 --> 26:05.932
Do you have any others?

26:05.965 --> 26:07.466
You don't like these?

26:07.499 --> 26:09.468
Uh... not really.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.471
That's surprising. Our design
team is award-winning.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.774
I just see this kinda thing
everywhere.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.442
It's overdone.

26:16.442 --> 26:19.411
You said you wanted to do
something different and special.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.114
I'll ask for more options.

26:22.114 --> 26:27.119
Oh, um, I put together a list
of names for our candle range.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.520
Hit me.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.989
Remember Candles.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.124
Memory Lights.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.025
- No.
- All right,

26:33.092 --> 26:34.961
just try to keep an open mind.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.996
- Memory Flame.
- Oof.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.130
Memory Journey.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.966
Ooh, hard pass.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.802
Okay, do you have anything
constructive to contribute?

26:42.802 --> 26:44.603
Because being a critic is easy,

26:44.637 --> 26:48.540
but actually coming up with
the ideas is a little hard, so--

26:48.607 --> 26:50.609
What about...
Memories by Pure?

26:50.643 --> 26:53.379
Because they're memories
and they're pure.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.381
You like it. Admit it.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.484
Sh... I don't,
I don't, I don't mind it.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.452
I can come up with
a few more if you'd like.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.721
No, no, no,
we don't have time.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.523
So, let's just go with
Memories by Pure.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.993
- Okay.
- And uh, we'll move on.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.628
- Sure.
- 'Cause it's... it's fine, you know.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.697
Okay.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.833
Yep, so good work
for both of us.

27:13.866 --> 27:14.967
Okay.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.842
How do you think
it went today? - I give us a 5 out of 10.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.477
- Ouch.
- I was hoping to make a little more progress.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.680
Well, the creative process
takes as long as it takes.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.917
No, actually, in this case,
it takes one week or less.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.719
- Roger that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.986
Bright and early.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.691
- Smells like romance.
- Stop it.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.726
Okay.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.777
- Morning!
- Oh!

27:59.511 --> 28:01.714
Hmm... what is this?

28:01.714 --> 28:03.850
- Green juice.
- Yes, I can see that it's green.

28:03.883 --> 28:04.951
Why would you drink it?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.685
It strengthens your
immune system,

28:06.719 --> 28:08.721
controls inflammation,
increases red blood cell production.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.222
Tastes like lawn clippings.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.623
Okay.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.561
Here are some spreadsheets
that I put together.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.897
We need to quickly come up
with a list of candle names,

28:17.897 --> 28:19.799
- scents, colours, ingredients.
- We don't need that.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.068
Making candles is not about
filling out a spreadsheet.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.236
This is a tried-and-true
product development method.

28:24.236 --> 28:27.239
It helps streamline the process
and makes things super efficient.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.809
Making candles
is an exploration, okay?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.710
We need to take the long
and winding road

28:31.744 --> 28:32.912
to get to where we need to go.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.546
I can't tell if you're joking.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.916
I mean, I really hope
you're j...

28:36.916 --> 28:38.084
Are you joking?

28:38.751 --> 28:40.119
I've never been more serious.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.922
All right, we don't have time
to take the scenic route.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.624
We are on a tight schedule
and I'm looking for a shortcut.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.259
There are no shortcuts.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.061
Come on, I'll show you.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.497
And you can leave
the spreadsheets behind.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.774
- Not what you were expecting?
- Not at all.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.010
All I can see and smell
is Christmas.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.978
Oh, and taste.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.650
Mm! This gingerbread's
delicious.

29:12.651 --> 29:13.786
Uh-huh...

29:16.088 --> 29:18.958
Now, all of our senses
are loaded with Christmas.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.126
We can begin.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.527
Begin what exactly?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.529
Exploring all of the scents

29:23.595 --> 29:25.297
and seeing what combinations
we wanna work with.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.603
You're probably not gonna need those spreadsheets.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.940
So what, I'm just
flying blind then?

29:33.973 --> 29:35.141
Not exactly.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.775
I know the way.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.189
I can't believe
how many ideas, memories,

29:50.222 --> 29:52.658
and emotions came flooding back

29:52.658 --> 29:54.326
about Christmas while
we were brainstorming.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.829
Yeah, I find stimulating
all the senses really helps

29:56.829 --> 29:58.564
trigger ideas and creativity.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.566
Being able to smell,
taste, and touch,

30:00.632 --> 30:01.968
it was all pretty incredible.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.836
And we didn't even
need the spreadsheet.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.671
Although, I will be going back
to the office

30:05.704 --> 30:07.639
and putting this all down
into a document.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.742
Okay. But first, some lunch?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.011
Okay, where do you
wanna order from?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.145
Oh.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.314
I made us some sandwiches.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.183
- Oh.
- Let's go.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
I've only known you a few days,

30:24.857 --> 30:27.860
but you really love the outside.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.696
Yeah, well, outside is
where I get my inspiration.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.032
I mean... smell that?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.234
Roasting chestnuts?

30:35.267 --> 30:37.736
Little cedar
and a little balsam.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.771
I mean, there are ideas
everywhere.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.075
All right, let's get this out.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.711
- You've prepared it all.
- Yep.

30:45.711 --> 30:49.048
We have turkey and cranberry
on sourdough.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.921
Mm. This bread is delicious.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.622
- I made it myself.
- Mm-hmm?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.224
Took a little while
to perfect.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.359
I got a sourdough starter
from my neighbour.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.029
- Uh-huh.
- You know what? It... never mind.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.630
I...

31:04.696 --> 31:07.299
Look, my sister banned me from
talking about breadmaking.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.969
She said she had to listen to me
drone on for 10 years

31:10.036 --> 31:11.237
about candle making,

31:11.237 --> 31:13.072
so breadmaking is where
she draws the line.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.942
Wow, you must really
love making things.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.776
Yeah, I do.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.947
You know, the... the art
and the science, the...

31:20.980 --> 31:22.281
the what and the how of it.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.416
- You like making things?
- Um, no.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.419
No, I'm universally terrible at making anything.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.055
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

31:29.088 --> 31:32.391
Well, I guess I'm good
at making decisions?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.093
And appointments.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.929
Well I'm... terrible
at making appointments.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.831
So, maybe together,
we'll make a great team.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.734
Maybe.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.071
Cheers!

31:49.775 --> 31:51.677
That's better. Nice and toasty.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.680
-Daddy! Daddy!
- Oh, hey pumpkin!

31:54.746 --> 31:57.749
- How was school?
- Great! We made Christmas cards.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.118
Oh, great!

31:59.118 --> 32:00.786
I'm Olive and I'm eight.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.455
Hi, Olive. I'm Juliet.
Nice to meet you!

32:03.489 --> 32:05.958
We won't be here long.
We just popped in for some art supplies

32:05.958 --> 32:07.193
for the ornament
decorating workshop.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.961
Oh. Go grab whatever you need.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.263
Ornament decorating
sounds fun.

32:11.297 --> 32:14.433
25 eight-year-olds fighting
over a single glue gun.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.935
It'll be something!

32:17.469 --> 32:19.138
He's terrible
at introductions.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.107
Hi, I'm Maya, Tom's sister.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.342
- You must be Juliet.
- Nice to meet you.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.177
I hope Tom isn't
boring you too much

32:25.211 --> 32:26.979
with the science of
candle making.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.781
Hey. Candle making is
very interesting.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.283
Wait till he starts in
on breadmaking.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.484
Too late.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.286
Will you guys stop talking

32:34.320 --> 32:36.022
about me like I'm not here?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.991
-I'm ready!
- That is my cue.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.160
Juliet, it was lovely
to meet you.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.029
Tom, I'll see you later.
All right.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.163
Have fun.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.966
You got a cute kid.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.801
It seems like a pretty
great sister, too.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.037
Yeah, I'm lucky.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.305
Maya helps out with
Olive all the time.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.141
I don't know how other
single parents do it.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.808
Yeah, must be a lot.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.511
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.180
One day.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.483
We should get back to work.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.018
Sure.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.527
So, what do you think?

33:15.561 --> 33:18.164
I'm going to a costume party
with Felix tonight.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.866
Oh, I think you make
a perfect Mrs. Claus.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.435
I wanted to say I'm fun,
I'm easygoing,

33:23.502 --> 33:25.204
I don't take life too seriously,

33:25.237 --> 33:27.839
but also, I'm looking for
something very serious

33:27.873 --> 33:29.041
and you might be my soulmate.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.077
I don't think a costume
could say all that.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.545
I feel like I could
fall in love tonight.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.214
It's your third date.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.384
Love can happen on
the third date if you let it.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.452
Especially during Christmas.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.521
Which is why you need to keep
an open mind

33:42.554 --> 33:43.922
about Hot Candle Guy.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.958
His name is Tom
and we're working together.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.761
Nothing else is going on at all.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.563
Mm-hmm.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.133
You don't know how
this could end...

33:54.200 --> 33:55.301
Yes, I do.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.303
In a successful project
and promotion,

33:57.369 --> 33:59.238
and that is all
I care about right now.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.372
Fine.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.074
But be honest with me.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.076
- This is hot, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

34:04.943 --> 34:05.911
I love the glasses.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.479
- Very authentic.
- Thank you.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.148
My granny gave them to me.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.581
And she's blind as a bat.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.252
- Oh. Can you see?
- Not even a little.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.253
Oh.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.562
- Did I do it right?
- Sure did. Looks perfect.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.965
- Can I go play?
- Of course you can. Off you go.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.103
So, Juliet seems lovely.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.172
Well, you met her
for less than 90 seconds.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.440
Well, I only needed that long

34:34.473 --> 34:37.109
to work out that
she's friendly and gorgeous.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.110
Is she? I hadn't noticed.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.281
When you knocked over
my snow globe in 2nd grade,

34:42.313 --> 34:44.616
I knew straight away.
So, don't even try.

34:45.251 --> 34:48.286
- Okay, she's a nice person.
- Mm-hmm.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.621
She's attractive.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.956
And nice and attractive people

34:51.956 --> 34:54.293
don't just fall into
your lap every day.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.328
She didn't fall in my lap.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.265
- She kinda did.
- Okay, stop.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.099
We're not having
this conversation.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.135
Juliet and I are just
doing a project together.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.303
That's it.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.971
We'll see about that.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.340
No... we won't.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.284
What do you think?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.352
I asked you to put together

35:20.386 --> 35:23.522
a range of different candle
samples for us to choose from.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.557
Yeah, here they are.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.561
- But these are all identical.
- Ah, but they're not.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.364
Each one is handcrafted
and organically shaped.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.233
No two are the same.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.001
The magic is in the aroma.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.969
Okay. Um...

35:38.003 --> 35:40.138
when I asked for samples,

35:40.172 --> 35:43.475
I meant a range of different
shapes and sizes,

35:43.509 --> 35:45.344
like tall candles for the table

35:45.344 --> 35:47.313
or small ones
for stocking stuffers.

35:47.346 --> 35:50.048
- Stocking stuffers?
- Yeah, well, it's Christmas, you know.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.917
But that's not how I work.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.019
My brand is
the one shape and colour.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.355
Well, that's another thing.
We're gonna have to offer more than one colour.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.556
Hilda will never
agree otherwise.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.591
Hold... hold on.
I thought you came to me

35:59.658 --> 36:02.494
- because you wanted my candles.
- And I do.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.496
Well, it sounds like
you're trying to make something completely new.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.266
No, no, no, not at all.
You are in charge of the candle making.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.568
I'm just in charge of
the marketing strategy.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.670
Like, okay, imagine
you're scrolling through

36:11.703 --> 36:13.705
- your social media and--
- I'm not on social media.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.207
Of course you're not.

36:15.207 --> 36:18.176
But I am, and my job is
to sell via social media.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.412
And the Goodwell was built
on social media,

36:20.446 --> 36:22.281
so you're gonna have
to trust me.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.051
Okay. Fine.
Explain what you want us to do.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.455
All right, so customers love
the organic shape of your candles.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.390
But I really wanna
catch their eye

36:31.390 --> 36:33.459
when they think of Christmas.
So, why don't we try

36:33.525 --> 36:36.962
just a few subtle
Christmas shapes and colours

36:37.028 --> 36:41.099
that really evoke gift-giving
and celebration, huh?

36:41.433 --> 36:43.569
Okay. I... I guess
we could give it a try.

36:43.602 --> 36:46.071
- That's the spirit.
- But we're just in the testing phase.

36:46.071 --> 36:47.406
I will take it.

36:52.411 --> 36:55.381
Here are the bottles of dye
and everything we need.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.584
Great. Let's try
some Christmas colours, red and green.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.453
Okay. Let's make some candles.

37:02.087 --> 37:05.223
* He ain't comin'
by boat or plane *

37:05.724 --> 37:08.260
No, no, just push
like this. Just push.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.597
Chunks off.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.332
Ugh!

37:14.766 --> 37:17.269
* Come on, Santa
Bring those toys *

37:17.269 --> 37:18.670
Come on!
I can't!

37:18.737 --> 37:20.238
You can do it.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.510
* The only thing I need
Come on, Santa *

37:24.576 --> 37:28.414
* Is my baby on Christmas Eve

37:33.485 --> 37:36.121
* Let's hope
the weather's good *

37:36.121 --> 37:40.125
* And his elf flight crew
finds my neighbourhood *

37:40.125 --> 37:43.329
* I know that
he's been here before *

37:43.362 --> 37:46.665
* But this year
he's gonna use the door *

37:46.698 --> 37:49.635
* I'm beggin' please
keep an open seat *

37:49.635 --> 37:51.303
Doing okay?

37:51.303 --> 37:52.638
What?

37:53.305 --> 37:56.542
* Come on Santa,
bring those toys *

37:56.608 --> 37:59.110
Oops!

38:00.278 --> 38:02.481
* The only thing I need
Come on, Santa *

38:02.514 --> 38:05.351
* Is my baby on Christmas Eve

38:05.384 --> 38:07.118
- Look.
- Like that?

38:11.857 --> 38:14.660
* It's that time of year

38:15.527 --> 38:17.829
Oh, here we go.
There it is.

38:17.829 --> 38:21.367
* He ain't comin'
by boat or plane *

38:21.400 --> 38:24.670
* He's loaded down
with candy canes *

38:24.670 --> 38:28.707
* I only hope he keeps
one open seat *

38:28.740 --> 38:30.576
* Oh yeah

38:31.343 --> 38:32.478
Okay.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.680
- Yay!
- Yay!

38:34.713 --> 38:37.716
* Bring all the presents
for the girls and boys *

38:37.749 --> 38:40.519
* The only thing I need
Come on, Santa *

38:40.519 --> 38:45.857
* Is my baby on Christmas Eve

38:49.495 --> 38:52.197
* Let's hope
the weather's good *

38:52.197 --> 38:56.267
* And his elf flight crew
finds my neighbourhood *

38:57.202 --> 38:58.336
- Yep.
- Are you ready?

38:58.370 --> 39:00.238
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go. It's gonna be hot.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.607
Okay!

39:02.374 --> 39:03.709
Smells so good.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.112
- Last one, here we go. Red.
- Yeah.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.880
* Oh yeah

39:08.914 --> 39:11.216
We're all done.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.687
Mm!

39:18.790 --> 39:22.894
* Is my baby on Christmas Eve

39:29.535 --> 39:30.602
- Boo!
- Oof!

39:30.636 --> 39:32.237
Very impressive.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.905
The green, red, and white
are a good combination.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.409
- You were right.
- Can I get that in writing?

39:37.409 --> 39:39.377
And the different shapes
work for Christmas.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.547
Well, thank you
for trusting me.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.449
What are you doing now?

39:43.482 --> 39:45.417
Oh, um, Lucy and I
are decorating cookies

39:45.451 --> 39:47.653
for the office.
Spreading some Christmas cheer.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.621
Olive's been bugging me
to make cookies.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.322
Maybe she and I should
do that tonight, too.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.592
Yeah. Ooh, hold on.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.563
Hey, I was just talking
about you.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.798
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.233
Yeah, just go have fun
with Felix.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.602
Okay.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.837
Well, that was over
before it started.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.573
Lucy has a better offer,

40:07.606 --> 40:09.608
a date with a new guy
she's crazy about.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.409
Hard to compete with new love.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.844
Yeah, but it's a bummer.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.313
I had some new decorating hacks
I wanted to try.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.282
I thought you didn't
like making things.

40:17.315 --> 40:19.951
Oh no, I do.
I'm just a disaster zone.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.788
I wouldn't recommend you actually eat anything I make.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.456
You know, I make
a pretty mean cookie.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.825
I remember.
Your gingerbread was delicious.

40:26.858 --> 40:29.495
And... if you're looking
for some company,

40:29.528 --> 40:30.796
Olive and I could join you.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.199
I'd be happy to show you
some of my baking tips.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.501
Really, are you sure?

40:35.534 --> 40:37.435
I mean, Olive would love it

40:37.469 --> 40:41.473
and I'm always interested in
learning new hacks in any genre.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.341
Okay, yeah, let's do it.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.977
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- 'Kay.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.828
This is Mrs. Claus.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.564
Oh, well, Mrs. Claus
is my favourite.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.998
Me too!

41:06.998 --> 41:08.867
You know she does so much work
behind the scenes

41:08.900 --> 41:11.837
and never gets any credit?
It's all Santa, Santa, Santa.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.972
Exactly.
That's what I think.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.707
- Oh!
- Santa's pretty good too.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.809
I mean, he's busy
making all those toys.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.512
Daddy, the elves
make the toys.

41:20.512 --> 41:22.347
- Ooh.
- She's right.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.250
Well, Santa makes a list.
Checks it twice.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.353
Uh, I think we all know
Mrs. Claus made that list.

41:28.386 --> 41:31.723
All Santa does is
deliver the toys.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.725
The glory work we call that,
right, Olive?

41:33.759 --> 41:34.993
That's right.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.428
You know, you're super fun
to hang out with.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.430
- So are you!
- Aw.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.700
Do you wanna come visit us
on Christmas Day?

41:41.700 --> 41:43.334
We have room.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.904
My grandma can't come.

41:46.371 --> 41:47.505
Um...

41:47.539 --> 41:49.608
I'm sure Juliet has
her own people

41:49.675 --> 41:51.509
to spend Christmas with.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.713
- Yes, I... I do. I do.
- Okay.

41:54.746 --> 41:57.048
But if you change your mind,

41:57.048 --> 42:00.051
our address is 1258 Davis Way.

42:00.085 --> 42:03.054
1258 Davis Way. Got it.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.759
She's having a ball.

42:08.426 --> 42:09.595
So am I.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.864
Marshmallow fight!

42:12.898 --> 42:14.800
Oh! Oh!

42:17.803 --> 42:18.804
No way! No way! No way!

42:21.406 --> 42:23.041
Oh!

42:23.074 --> 42:24.576
Excuse me!
Me too!

42:24.610 --> 42:27.646
Sneak attacks are not allowed!
Not allowed!

42:38.423 --> 42:40.926
- Hey.
- Hey! Right on time.

42:40.959 --> 42:44.429
- Right on time.
- Well, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.

42:44.429 --> 42:46.097
Are you kidding?
I love this place. - Oh good!

42:46.131 --> 42:47.633
I thought we could just
walk around

42:47.666 --> 42:49.768
and take in all
the Christmas smells and sights,

42:49.801 --> 42:52.437
and try to come up with
a few Christmas memories to base our candles on.

42:52.437 --> 42:54.940
Oh, so you've decided that
a sterile office

42:54.940 --> 42:57.108
isn't the best place
to come up with ideas?

42:57.108 --> 43:00.679
Yeah, someone told me ideas
flow when you fill your senses.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.447
Oh, that someone sounds
really wise,

43:02.480 --> 43:04.950
not to mention incredibly
cool and interesting.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.451
- Yeah, he's all right.
- Oh!

43:06.451 --> 43:08.319
Come on, let's go.

43:08.854 --> 43:10.856
Oh, when I was a little girl,

43:10.922 --> 43:13.692
I used to bake gingerbread
with my Grandma Minnie.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.994
She was so soft-spoken
and patient.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.029
She didn't care if
I took too long

43:18.096 --> 43:20.799
or if my gingerbread
turned out to be terrible.

43:20.832 --> 43:23.001
She just loved
spending time with me

43:23.034 --> 43:24.602
and I loved spending time
with her.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.872
My mom was a single mom,

43:26.938 --> 43:29.641
and her mom died before
I was born, so...

43:29.675 --> 43:31.476
I never got to know
my grandmother.

43:31.476 --> 43:34.680
I feel so lucky that Olive
is so close with my mom.

43:34.713 --> 43:37.615
I just... I love watching them
spend time together.

43:37.649 --> 43:40.518
She'll remember it always.
I know I have.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.656
That should be
our first scent.

43:44.656 --> 43:47.693
We can call it,
"Grandma's Christmas Snuggles."

43:48.126 --> 43:49.995
- I like it.
- Yeah, I think it's good.

43:50.028 --> 43:51.496
Yeah.

43:51.496 --> 43:52.664
Oh, look over there.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.734
Oh!

43:55.801 --> 43:57.568
You know, I still have
my stocking

43:57.635 --> 43:58.837
from when I was a kid.

43:59.204 --> 44:01.907
- Do you?
- No, no.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.509
We moved so much, I don't know
what happened to it.

44:04.509 --> 44:06.912
My parents aren't really
the sentimental type.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.748
I'm not sure they kept anything,
except for me, of course.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.150
My mom was
the total opposite.

44:12.183 --> 44:13.885
She saved everything.

44:13.919 --> 44:15.486
And she loved making
things by hand.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.188
She actually made
my stocking for me.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.991
And it's covered in
these intricate snowflakes.

44:20.025 --> 44:22.994
It's a... it's
a real masterpiece.

44:23.028 --> 44:25.430
I don't remember her
making mine, I was too young,

44:25.496 --> 44:27.733
but I remember watching her
make my sister's,

44:27.766 --> 44:30.001
and it was like... magic.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.938
I mean, her furrowed brow,
her focus.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.540
So, you've loved handmade
things since you were a kid.

44:36.574 --> 44:39.010
Yeah, I... I guess
I got that gift from my mom.

44:39.044 --> 44:40.779
She put it in
your stocking for you.

44:40.846 --> 44:44.015
Yeah. Well, she also put
in a lot of chocolate and candy canes.

44:44.716 --> 44:46.918
Oh, well, that should be
our second memory, then.

44:46.952 --> 44:49.220
"Christmas Stocking Goodies."

44:50.188 --> 44:52.457
Yeah, Mom will get
a real kick out of that one.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.592
- Great!
- Okay.

44:57.262 --> 44:59.865
We have five memories so far.

45:00.631 --> 45:02.700
The first one is
Grandma's Christmas Snuggles,

45:02.734 --> 45:05.703
which smells like
my Grandma Minnie's perfume,

45:05.737 --> 45:07.138
herbs, and fabric softener.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.107
Christmas Stocking Goodies,
which smells like chocolate

45:09.140 --> 45:11.209
- and candy cane.
- My personal favourite.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.144
Under the Christmas Tree,
which smells like

45:13.211 --> 45:15.046
Christmas tree, hot cocoa,
and cookies.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.748
Making Gingerbread,
which smells like

45:16.748 --> 45:18.950
cinnamon, ginger, cloves,
star anise, and honey.

45:18.984 --> 45:21.119
And then, finally,
Marshmallow and Kisses,

45:21.152 --> 45:23.088
which smells like
marshmallow and shampoo.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.723
Remind me why shampoo again?

45:25.757 --> 45:27.926
'Cause whenever my mom
would snuggle and kiss me,

45:27.959 --> 45:29.260
I could always smell
her shampoo.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.663
Are you gonna be able
to pull this off?

45:33.164 --> 45:34.232
I can try.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.935
Ideally, we need
one more memory.

45:36.935 --> 45:39.637
- Ugh, my brain is fried.
- Yeah, mine too.

45:39.670 --> 45:41.272
Could probably use
some sustenance.

45:41.272 --> 45:43.775
How do you feel about
ordering in some takeout to eat,

45:43.775 --> 45:45.076
inside this time?

45:45.110 --> 45:47.278
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.989
Christmas seems much more fun
when you have a kid around.

45:58.023 --> 46:00.625
We do have some pretty
special Christmas memories.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.829
There is one in particular.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.264
It was Olive's first Christmas.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.699
Her mom and I were so excited.

46:09.134 --> 46:11.837
Olive couldn't even roll over
and I bought her a tricycle.

46:14.172 --> 46:17.843
Oh Christmas Day, she laid
down on a blanket beside us,

46:18.309 --> 46:19.978
mesmerized by the lights
on the tree.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.049
She was giggling and smiling.

46:24.715 --> 46:26.284
Sounds pretty perfect.

46:27.685 --> 46:29.888
Olive and I lost Catherine,
so...

46:29.955 --> 46:32.858
that memory becomes
more and more precious to me every Christmas.

46:33.191 --> 46:35.961
Oh, Tom, I'm so sorry.

46:35.994 --> 46:37.896
Oh, it was a long time ago.

46:39.197 --> 46:41.967
Now, I just try to be present.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.235
And live in each moment.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.878
This building has such
old wiring.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.712
The power should
come back on soon. - Oh.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.714
Luckily, we're in
a candle store.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.856
It all looks so beautiful.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.058
Yeah, it does.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.827
Oh... what I meant was,

47:09.861 --> 47:13.098
sometimes it takes a blackout
to see things clearly.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.235
I should get that
in case it's Olive.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.904
Of course.

47:20.005 --> 47:21.372
Hey, Maya.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.341
Uh... oh no.

47:23.374 --> 47:25.576
Okay. I'll see you soon.

47:28.079 --> 47:29.780
- Oh.
- Oh. Power's back on.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.749
But um, I gotta go.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.118
Is everything okay?

47:33.184 --> 47:35.053
Well, Olive has a tummy ache.

47:35.053 --> 47:36.754
It's probably just
too many candy canes,

47:36.787 --> 47:38.689
but Maya thinks that
she should skip the Santa visit

47:38.723 --> 47:40.758
- they had planned, so...
- Hmm.

47:40.791 --> 47:43.228
- It's not going over well.
- I'm sorry she has to miss out.

47:43.228 --> 47:44.729
Yeah, me too.

47:54.439 --> 47:57.909
"Flashing across the sky
like a shooting star."

47:59.444 --> 48:00.745
Who's that?

48:00.745 --> 48:01.913
I don't know.

48:01.947 --> 48:03.248
I'll go check.

48:03.982 --> 48:05.250
You wait here.

48:08.386 --> 48:09.720
Merry Christmas!

48:09.754 --> 48:11.822
Tom, this is Mrs. Claus.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.758
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir,

48:13.758 --> 48:16.327
but I'm not here to see you,
so move aside!

48:17.128 --> 48:20.231
1258 Davis Way was
the address Santa gave me.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.800
Come on in.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.772
I'm looking for
a girl named Olive.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.840
- Does she live here?
- Mrs. Claus?

48:29.907 --> 48:32.810
Sure am!
And you must be Olive.

48:32.843 --> 48:34.145
What are you doing here?

48:34.812 --> 48:35.981
A little elfie told me

48:36.014 --> 48:37.315
you were supposed to see
my husband today,

48:37.348 --> 48:39.150
but didn't make it
to your appointment.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.319
I have a tummy ache.

48:41.352 --> 48:43.989
Oh. Well, Santa's stuck
at the mall,

48:44.022 --> 48:45.690
but I had an opening
in my schedule,

48:45.756 --> 48:46.857
so I thought I'd come instead.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.960
You're even better than Santa.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.861
Thank you. I know.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.164
That's what I've been
trying to say.

48:53.198 --> 48:55.800
Can I get you a drink of water
or hot cocoa, Mrs. Claus?

48:55.833 --> 48:58.303
No, not for me.
Now, leave us to it.

48:59.004 --> 49:01.339
Are you here to ask
what I want for Christmas?

49:01.372 --> 49:04.209
Yes, I am! Let me get ready.

49:05.810 --> 49:08.713
Okay, Olive, shoot.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.781
It's pretty tricky.

49:10.815 --> 49:12.317
Oh no, don't worry about that.

49:12.350 --> 49:15.453
I've got incredible
resources at my disposal.

49:16.054 --> 49:20.491
And it's not the normal
kind of thing kids ask for.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.160
No such thing as normal.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.996
One time, a little boy
asked me for a pet unicorn.

49:25.030 --> 49:27.465
And then, another wanted
an invisibility potion.

49:27.498 --> 49:30.901
And one time, a little girl
asked me to make her pet hamster smile.

49:32.503 --> 49:35.240
This is definitely
easier than that.

49:35.306 --> 49:36.307
Okay.

49:39.477 --> 49:44.015
I really, really, really...

49:45.916 --> 49:48.986
want my grandma to be here
on Christmas Day.

49:49.354 --> 49:51.422
No toys or anything.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.358
Just my grandma.

49:53.358 --> 49:54.759
Oh...

49:57.028 --> 49:59.764
O-okay, Olive.
You know what?

49:59.830 --> 50:02.367
I'm gonna put a special word in
with Santa for you.

50:02.367 --> 50:04.535
Thanks, Mrs. Claus.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.903
Oh!

50:05.936 --> 50:07.238
Oh.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.908
Okay, now, my reindeer have to
their dinner, so I've gotta go.

50:10.941 --> 50:13.278
Can Mrs. Claus
read me a story?

50:13.344 --> 50:16.047
Oh, I'm sure Mrs. Claus needs
to get back to the North Pole.

50:16.081 --> 50:18.449
Oh, no, no, no,
I'd love to read her a story.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.385
Why don't you show me
to your room?

50:20.385 --> 50:22.120
Let's go.

50:23.254 --> 50:24.789
So, what do you think?

50:24.855 --> 50:27.192
Can you make her Christmas wish
come true?

50:27.892 --> 50:30.795
My mom runs a big charity called Together,

50:30.861 --> 50:33.264
and they just lost
a major donor, so...

50:33.298 --> 50:35.400
things are a bit tight,
and she can't get away.

50:35.433 --> 50:37.102
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:37.135 --> 50:40.271
Yeah, I didn't realize that
Olive was taking it this hard.

50:40.305 --> 50:43.808
- But now I do, so thank you.
- Anytime.

50:43.874 --> 50:46.111
I should probably go
check on them. - Mm-hmm.

50:59.624 --> 51:01.926
Sorry, I was trying to get her
to go to sleep,

51:01.926 --> 51:03.961
but still story time
with Mrs. Claus.

51:03.994 --> 51:06.431
It's okay. Uh, she is
such a great kid.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.333
Yeah, yeah, she really is.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.569
Look, thanks so much for making
tonight so special for her.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.304
- Oh, it was nothing.
- No.

51:13.338 --> 51:16.141
No, it was... it was
definitely something.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.476
You are...

51:19.610 --> 51:21.279
Whoo!

51:21.312 --> 51:22.847
Daddy, look at me!

51:22.913 --> 51:24.182
Story time's over.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.284
- Um, I should...
- We should...

51:26.284 --> 51:27.252
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:27.285 --> 51:28.986
- See you tomorrow?
- Yes.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.456
Come on. Off to bed.

51:39.464 --> 51:41.999
It's just not coming together.

51:42.032 --> 51:43.301
And we're running out of time.

51:43.334 --> 51:44.335
Let me smell.

51:45.503 --> 51:47.438
That's supposed to be
Under the Christmas Tree.

51:47.472 --> 51:50.308
Hmm, maybe too much
Christmas Tree. - Hmm.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.343
I'll try it again with
less pine and frankincense.

51:53.478 --> 51:54.979
Uh...

51:56.347 --> 51:57.982
Hi, Hilda.

51:59.049 --> 52:01.652
Yeah, right now?
Okay, I'll see you soon.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.622
Hilda wants to discuss

52:04.655 --> 52:06.457
the preliminary budget
right now.

52:07.024 --> 52:07.992
I'll keep working at this.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.494
Okay, good luck.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.507
They are stunning.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.242
And they really evoke Christmas.

52:24.309 --> 52:26.344
We're just finalizing
the scents and--

52:26.377 --> 52:28.479
I would've thought you'd have
finished the product by now?

52:28.513 --> 52:30.381
Well, it's only been
a few days.

52:30.415 --> 52:32.483
That is not
our biggest problem.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.352
These costs are simply too high.

52:34.352 --> 52:36.687
- Well, it's a high-value item.
- That may be so, but at this point,

52:36.721 --> 52:40.057
we're going to have
to price them at $150 a unit.

52:40.090 --> 52:43.261
And they will be worth it.
They are uniquely tailored.

52:43.328 --> 52:45.263
A one-of-a-kind creation.

52:45.330 --> 52:47.198
A meaningful gift with hours
of burning life.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.934
Juliet, the purpose
of this project

52:50.000 --> 52:52.036
is to create a small
product drop

52:52.069 --> 52:55.373
that will drive a wide range of
customers to our website.

52:55.406 --> 52:59.109
The product has to have
a wide appeal. - I... I know this.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.445
Well, you also know a candle

53:00.511 --> 53:03.714
with $150 price tag
has a limited market.

53:03.748 --> 53:06.451
Most people are gonna look
at that and they're just gonna move on.

53:06.517 --> 53:09.086
I see your point.
But Tom and I really believe--

53:09.119 --> 53:11.121
I am not interested
in what Tom thinks.

53:12.390 --> 53:13.691
Well, we're partners.

53:13.724 --> 53:15.560
He is your supplier.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.295
This is your project.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.197
I'm beginning to think that
you've become distracted

53:20.231 --> 53:23.601
with the creative process
and your handsome collaborator.

53:24.269 --> 53:26.971
So, put your business hat on.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.406
The numbers need to add up.

53:28.406 --> 53:32.610
So, bring the costs down
and lock in the product.

53:32.643 --> 53:35.145
Because you are running
out of time, Juliet.

53:43.754 --> 53:46.491
Why do we give presents
to all our neighbours,

53:46.557 --> 53:48.058
even the ones we don't know?

53:48.092 --> 53:49.627
Well, it's a neighbourhood
tradition.

53:49.660 --> 53:53.097
And because Christmas
is a time of giving.

53:53.130 --> 53:55.065
Grandma is helping
families in need

53:55.099 --> 53:57.101
and we are doing
our part by giving gifts.

53:57.101 --> 53:58.669
Yeah, like working
at the soup kitchen.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.272
- Maya and I do that every year.
- We sure do.

54:01.272 --> 54:03.240
I like that we help people,

54:03.608 --> 54:06.311
but I still wish
Grandma was here.

54:06.344 --> 54:07.745
Me too, kiddo.

54:12.483 --> 54:14.084
I'm all done.

54:14.118 --> 54:16.687
- I'm gonna go play now.
- Okay.

54:20.791 --> 54:24.429
So... how is the memory candle
project going?

54:25.363 --> 54:27.532
Well. Really, really well.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.435
Oh! Really, really well.

54:31.268 --> 54:33.638
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

54:33.671 --> 54:35.473
I was talking
about the candles.

54:35.506 --> 54:37.308
I finally figured out
all the scents today.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.676
It was really complicated.

54:38.709 --> 54:40.044
Mm-hmm?

54:40.945 --> 54:43.648
- What?
- Nothing! It's just like

54:43.681 --> 54:47.485
so obvious that you really,
really like Juliet.

54:47.518 --> 54:50.220
Maya, you said
you were gonna stop trying to set me up with people.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.722
I am not trying to set you up.

54:51.789 --> 54:55.826
I am just nudging you
towards happiness.

54:55.826 --> 54:58.363
- Feels more like a shove.
- I just want you to be happy.

54:58.396 --> 54:59.530
I am happy.

54:59.564 --> 55:03.133
Really, really happy?

55:03.668 --> 55:04.735
What? Okay.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.808
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm. Come on.

55:18.349 --> 55:20.485
- Hi.
- Hey! You made it.

55:20.518 --> 55:21.852
What is all this?

55:21.886 --> 55:24.689
So, I finally worked out
the Christmas tree scent.

55:24.689 --> 55:26.591
- Goodness.
- What do you think?

55:28.659 --> 55:30.595
Smells just like
a Christmas tree.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.197
Can't believe it.
You're... you're a genius.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.500
So, why are we here?

55:35.533 --> 55:37.201
Oh, so now that we have
all the scents,

55:37.201 --> 55:39.336
we could get
some customer feedback,

55:39.370 --> 55:41.406
and then, see if we need
to do any final tweaking.

55:41.439 --> 55:44.274
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- And then, once we get the feedback,

55:44.341 --> 55:45.710
we're finally done.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.879
Well, not exactly.

55:48.913 --> 55:51.215
Um, I just spoke to Hilda

55:51.248 --> 55:53.718
and we need to get
our unit price down.

55:54.251 --> 55:55.553
But the only way to do that

55:55.586 --> 55:57.588
is by using cheap,
artificial scents.

55:57.622 --> 55:59.424
And you know that's not
what I want,

55:59.457 --> 56:01.426
but we need to explore
all options.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.463
- This is how it starts.
- The... how-what starts?

56:05.530 --> 56:07.765
What exactly
are you talking about? - You change one thing,

56:07.798 --> 56:10.568
and then another, until
there's nothing left of the original idea.

56:10.601 --> 56:12.269
That's not what's
happening here.

56:12.302 --> 56:14.405
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

56:14.439 --> 56:17.274
Look, I care about this project
as much as you do.

56:17.307 --> 56:19.410
You're not the only one
that has a lot riding on it.

56:19.444 --> 56:20.745
What does that mean?

56:20.745 --> 56:24.615
Well, this project is
kinda like a test for me.

56:24.649 --> 56:27.785
If I can pull it off,
I get a huge promotion.

56:28.419 --> 56:30.888
So, you just brought me in
as a pawn so you could get a promotion?

56:30.921 --> 56:33.724
No! That... that's not
what I just said!

56:33.758 --> 56:36.293
And here, I was thinking
that we were trying to make something special together.

56:36.326 --> 56:37.628
We are!

56:37.662 --> 56:40.431
Two things can be true
at the same time.

56:40.465 --> 56:41.632
Come--

56:42.967 --> 56:45.836
Tom, I don't understand why
you're so upset about this.

56:45.903 --> 56:48.773
I asked you to be
totally transparent.

56:48.773 --> 56:51.442
- And I have been.
- Seems like a pretty big detail to leave out.

56:51.476 --> 56:53.444
A personal detail
about my career.

56:53.478 --> 56:55.513
You and I have
a business relationship.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.281
A business relationship?

56:58.516 --> 56:59.784
That... that came out wrong.

56:59.784 --> 57:02.487
No. No, you're right,
this is just business.

57:02.520 --> 57:06.491
Tom, I have been honest
with you about everything.

57:06.524 --> 57:09.960
Look, I didn't keep this
from you, I just didn't think it mattered.

57:09.994 --> 57:14.298
That's all. I...
I never thought you would feel this way about it.

57:16.467 --> 57:19.169
To be honest... neither did I.

57:19.804 --> 57:22.807
Look, my last collaboration
did not go well.

57:22.807 --> 57:24.675
There were a lot of lies.

57:25.510 --> 57:28.212
I guess I'm just a little
suspicious this time around.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.315
What if I pitched to Hilda
a two-tier line?

57:31.315 --> 57:33.784
A premium line with
more natural ingredients

57:33.818 --> 57:37.522
that you want, and then,
a cost-effective line that she needs?

57:38.556 --> 57:39.957
I could be okay with that.

57:40.491 --> 57:41.959
You can trust me.
I promise

57:41.992 --> 57:43.661
we are in this together.

57:44.662 --> 57:45.496
Good.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.832
Let's get back to the stall.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.503
Could we get you to smell
a candle for a second?

57:52.537 --> 57:56.240
Hi! Would you like to just...
take... hmm.

57:56.306 --> 57:57.908
Hi, would you like to try a...

57:58.843 --> 58:01.679
Hi! Would you like
to smell... the candles?

58:01.679 --> 58:03.413
Sir, could I get you
to smell the...

58:03.480 --> 58:04.682
I...

58:05.816 --> 58:09.720
Do you wanna smell... just...
all right.

58:09.754 --> 58:13.023
Hi, do you have five minutes
to answer some questions about a...

58:13.057 --> 58:14.925
Nope.

58:15.860 --> 58:17.361
Everyone's in such a rush.

58:17.962 --> 58:19.329
I have an idea.

58:19.363 --> 58:20.865
- Be right back.
- Where are you going?

58:20.898 --> 58:23.701
To get something that'll make
people stop in their tracks.

58:26.537 --> 58:29.707
Could I get you to... no?
Okay.

58:33.711 --> 58:35.445
Where did you even
get these from?

58:35.512 --> 58:38.783
Lucy. Her wardrobe is
like a costume store.

58:39.383 --> 58:40.618
We don't even
look like candles.

58:41.385 --> 58:42.720
Speak for yourself.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.355
I look and feel like
a burning flame.

58:45.389 --> 58:47.725
I can't believe
I agreed to this. - Yeah, well, it's working.

58:47.758 --> 58:49.760
- Hi! Would you like to smell?
- Oh, hi.

58:49.794 --> 58:52.797
Can you answer some questions
after if you like it?

58:55.766 --> 58:57.602
Is it good? Yeah?

58:57.635 --> 58:59.904
Would you like to smell? Yeah?

59:00.871 --> 59:03.307
What if I went like this?
Whoop!

59:03.373 --> 59:05.375
Oh, can I hit you up?
You'll like it.

59:05.409 --> 59:06.711
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah?

59:06.744 --> 59:08.312
Okay, the Christmas Tree.
Wanna smell that one?

59:08.378 --> 59:09.814
You like it? Yeah, yeah!

59:09.880 --> 59:12.049
Oh!

59:12.082 --> 59:15.485
Oh! Yeah, a little
high candle there.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.093
Can't believe how fast
the day went.

59:23.093 --> 59:25.630
I feel really burnt out.
Get it?

59:26.430 --> 59:28.766
- Yeah, I get it.
- You're really wick...ed.

59:28.766 --> 59:31.568
- They were no match for us!
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

59:31.602 --> 59:33.804
What, you don't like my pun?
That makes no "scents!"

59:33.838 --> 59:35.773
Please stop.

59:35.773 --> 59:36.807
Oh.

59:39.109 --> 59:42.512
Uh, hi, Hilda. Um...

59:43.080 --> 59:45.816
Tomorrow? But it's only been a--

59:45.850 --> 59:48.485
okay, sure.
I will see you then.

59:48.953 --> 59:51.622
Uh, Hilda's getting a little
nervous on our timeline

59:51.656 --> 59:53.758
and wants to hear
our presentation tomorrow.

59:53.791 --> 59:55.626
Doesn't she know that
we're nowhere close to ready?

59:55.860 --> 59:57.962
Well, there's no
such thing as not ready.

59:57.995 --> 59:59.630
I'll just have to work
through the night.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.799
Looks like we'll be burning
the candle at both ends.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.868
Oh, look who's having pun now.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.836
But I'll work on the budgets

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.371
and I'll get you some
new numbers for tonight.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.706
Okay, great.
And I'll make sure that

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:10.374
our presentation is
tea-lightful.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.776
Ha-ha.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.817
Uh...

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:23.153
- Hey, where are you?
- About that.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:24.889
Maya can't open the store
this morning

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.057
and I think you can handle
the presentation on your own?

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:28.558
<i>It's a little last minute,</i>

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.460
but um, yes, yeah,
I can handle it.

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:32.897
- <i>I'll let you know how it goes.</i>
- Okay, thanks for understanding.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:33.998
Good luck.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.567
Great.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:43.407
Now priced at $75 per unit,

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.410
the Memories by Pure range
are organic candles

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:50.014
made with 100% pure soy wax
and natural oils,

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:51.849
designed for
a broad customer base--

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:53.183
This all looks great.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:55.519
No, no, no, I still have
a lot more to go through.

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:57.187
I haven't even told you
about the premium line.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:59.523
I have heard enough.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.591
It ticks all the boxes.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.061
I just have a few tweaks,
and then, we have sign off.

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.864
- A few tweaks?
- Oh, nothing significant.

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:09.499
Just an amendment clause or two
I'll attach to the contract

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:12.703
and send it to Tom.
There is no time to waste.

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.672
All right, well,
I'll get started on the social media campaign.

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:18.575
Congratulations, Juliet.
You did it.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.877
Thank you.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:21.912
This is my favourite.

01:01:21.946 --> 01:01:24.715
Mm.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.620
Have a merry Christmas.

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:34.925
Hey. How'd it go?

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.193
Hilda loved it.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.228
So, it's happening?
Just like that?

01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:40.064
<i>Pretty much.</i>

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:42.566
Yeah, she said she had a few
tweaks, but it's all systems go.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.735
<i>Uh, we have so much work to do</i>

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.904
- before the launch next week.
- I'd better get started.

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.138
How many candles do we need?

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:51.041
Uh, we are still
working that out,

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.543
but you should receive
paperwork today with the order.

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.780
I feel like I've been

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:57.948
half holding my breath
since we started.

01:01:57.982 --> 01:02:01.085
Well, now you can breathe
easy 'cause we did it.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.153
- Together.
<i>- We did.</i>

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.756
Catherine and I started
this business together.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.258
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a team

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.626
and share the wins.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.962
We should get a drink.
We should celebrate!

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:13.130
<i>Do you have time for a drink?</i>

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:16.100
Uh... not really.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.168
There's just so much to do.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.004
Of course. Um...

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.772
let me know if there's
anything I can do.

01:02:21.806 --> 01:02:22.940
Okay.

01:02:36.921 --> 01:02:39.623
Juliet, something
amazing's happened!

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.826
Fantastic. Just tell me
about it after the launch.

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:43.260
Juliet?

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.630
Oh, is that for
best decorated office?

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:49.299
First place!
The candle launch, and this,

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:51.201
an equally important
achievement.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.702
You should be celebrating!

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.204
I wish. I need to work.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.640
You don't need to work.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.975
- You've been at it all day.
- Wow.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.878
And I will continue
to be at it all night.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.847
This is a major moment.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.050
Can you please stop and smell
the rose-scented candles for once?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.717
Great things are happening.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.954
You should try to enjoy it.
That's all I'm trying to say.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.188
Maybe you're right.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.622
Of course I'm right!

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:14.158
And speaking of being right,

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:17.327
I think you should
open yourself up to Tom.

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:19.997
I know you and you've been
walking on air

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:23.200
- for the last few days.
- I've just been enjoying the creative process.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.069
It's not just that
and you know it.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.704
So, you can bury your head
in work and let it pass you by,

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.074
or you can take this

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.142
and see what happens.

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:33.844
Hmm?

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.149
The Goodwell
sent the order.

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.685
This is incredible news!
What's the next step?

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.654
I'm not sure,
but it's all in here.

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.029
What's wrong?

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:53.830
These are new contract pages.

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:56.700
They made some
pretty big changes.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.342
20 different scents?
Candles in every colour?

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.744
Customers get to choose
their scent combinations?

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:10.214
I mean, that's not
a few minor tweaks, that's total destruction.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:12.716
- I'm not doing it.
- This is so unclear.

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:14.784
I don't even understand
how they can do this.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.887
They're activating
an option, apparently.

01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:19.789
"If the product is deemed
successful by the Goodwell,

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:23.393
the Goodwell has the right
to opt to increase production

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:27.064
and extend the aforementioned
product collection."

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:30.034
This is so unclear.
They don't define successful

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.969
or how much they can
increase production.

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.403
Maybe you should talk
to a lawyer?

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.705
I don't have that kind
of money. You know that.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.908
I need to figure out a way
to make this work.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:40.810
I never should've signed.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.984
Oh! I love it!

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:48.285
I'll take this one.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:51.755
Thank you!

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.092
For the launch, you have
to make 300 candles,

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:57.928
but next year,
when they increase production,

01:04:57.928 --> 01:04:59.930
you could be required
to make 5,000 a week.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.966
That's impossible.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:03.333
I... I can't deliver that.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.935
You're gonna have
to find a way

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:06.770
or you might be
in breach of your contract.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:16.413
I decided you were right.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.083
We should celebrate. Here.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.118
And this is a little something
I saw for Olive

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:23.420
to put under the tree.
I couldn't help myself.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.027
Is everything okay?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.996
We need to talk.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:38.435
I took this process seriously

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.137
and I was proud of what
we came up with.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.272
Yeah, I'm proud, too.
What's going on?

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:43.807
I read the paperwork.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.377
Memories by Pure range
isn't six, beautiful,

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:48.945
well-crafted memory candles.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:52.316
It's a cheap, DIY, mass-produced
scented candle range

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:55.119
where customers
mix and match scents online.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:55.986
Uh...

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.188
Mixing scents is complex.

01:05:58.222 --> 01:06:00.157
I can't let customers
do that themselves.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.492
It's a terrible idea
that won't work,

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:04.328
which is something
I could've told you

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:06.896
- if you had just asked me--
- I didn't know about any of this.

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:09.733
How can you say that
with a straight face?

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.168
I didn't!

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:13.903
I've been working
on the social media campaign.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.040
I've spent all day
talking to influencers.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:18.342
I hadn't read over
Hilda's changes yet.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.977
Tom, you can trust me.

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.979
I didn't know!

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:27.084
Look, Hilda said she wanted
a small drop, a boutique range.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.086
She obviously changed her mind.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:31.355
Look, I'm sorry she made
all these changes, okay?

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.523
I didn't know about any of this!

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:37.094
Okay. Okay, so now that
you do know, will you change it back to the way it was?

01:06:38.262 --> 01:06:40.230
- I... I can't.
- Of course you can't.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:44.201
Hilda is my boss, okay?
She does what she wants.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.036
This is obviously
what she wants.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:48.338
What she wants is gonna
ruin my business.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:51.041
How is that possible?
Your business will be booming!

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:54.878
Next year, I am contracted to make 5,000 candles a week.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.781
5,000 a week! I don't have
the facilities for that.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.949
And if I don't deliver,
the Goodwell will sue.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.785
That is easily solved.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.888
Because I can help you
expand your operation

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:07.291
and open... open
another workshop!

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:10.194
There's still time
to make changes! - But that's not what I want!

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:13.397
I thought you understood.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:17.067
I don't wanna make junk
and constantly push and grow.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:20.970
I wanna protect and enjoy
the beauty I already have.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.374
I don't...

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:40.424
It's not a complete disaster.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:42.926
Kind of feels
like it is right now.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.296
But you're almost Senior
Vice President of Marketing.

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.099
I know. It's amazing.

01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:50.300
It's just that...

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.437
Tom and I worked so hard on this

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:56.273
and he's so mad at me right now.

01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.443
I'll get over it.

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:02.011
You mean you'll get over him?

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.947
Yeah, I mean I'll...

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.249
get over all of it.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:10.154
- Reload?
- Yeah.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:17.161
Cheers.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.640
Daddy! Daddy! Do you wanna
make a gingerbread house?

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.443
- Not right now.
- Why?

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:35.111
I'm super busy, kiddo.

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:36.979
But Dad, please?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.651
Look, I'm... I'm sorry,
sweet pea, I just have a lot to do, okay? Maybe tomorrow.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:52.196
Hey, Juliet, it's Olive.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.465
Do you wanna come over
and make a gingerbread house?

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:57.033
Pretty please?

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.903
My dad wants to talk to you.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.473
Hi.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.143
Yeah, she's very persuasive.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.550
This is going to be
the best gingerbread house in the world.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:16.019
I think so, too.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:20.323
Uh, um, where would you
put this one?

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.691
Hmm...

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:25.495
maybe here because
it kind of looks like

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.997
Christmas lights
on top of a roof.

01:09:28.031 --> 01:09:30.434
Yeah, it... it does.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:36.540
Hey, Dad, doesn't it
look amazing?

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:40.042
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
it looks great, honey.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:45.582
Uh, so I think,
let's just let this dry.

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.417
- It should take about 20 minutes.
- Thanks, Juliet.

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:51.187
- I'll see you then.
- Okay.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:05.735
- You don't have to do that.
- It's fine. Um...

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:11.308
um... look, Tom...

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:16.280
I'm really sorry about
how things ended up.

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.649
When I came by the store, um...

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:23.653
seeing you so angry,
this was the last thing I expected to happen.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.555
Why did you come by the store?

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.325
Just to celebrate and um...

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.395
see where the night took us.

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:36.600
I never thought
it would take us here.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:42.339
Uh, look, if you need help with
the launch, I can bring--

01:10:42.406 --> 01:10:44.140
It's... under control.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.276
I'd rather work alone
from now on.

01:10:48.312 --> 01:10:52.081
Okay. Um, so I should...
I should probably go.

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:56.286
But just tell Olive
goodbye for me, okay?

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:05.329
* Happy to be around

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:08.632
* Happy to say I'm here

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:12.168
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas *

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.305
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas **

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:17.807
- How's everything shaping up?
- Good! Good.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:20.644
Tom is working around the clock
on the small release of candles.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.812
We sent samples to a range
of wellness influencers

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:24.514
- to start the marketing campaign.
- Good.

01:11:24.548 --> 01:11:25.815
Countdown to the website is on

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:27.817
and traffic to the website
has increased already.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:30.520
Hmm. What are you thinking
for the launch?

01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:32.456
Oh, just something
small and online

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:34.524
- from the Goodwell offices.
- Oh no.

01:11:34.558 --> 01:11:37.327
We need something
in person and online.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.332
How about we have a launch
party at the candle store?

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:45.301
Do a Q&A with Tom,
we'll stream it on social media

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:47.170
and take questions from
all over the Internet?

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.473
Ooh, do we really need
to have Tom there?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.541
Of course we do.
Tom's brand gives

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:53.242
the whole range credibility.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.345
- And he's easy on the eyes.
- Hilda.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:57.347
Well, it's true.
It doesn't make sense

01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:59.816
not to have him
front and centre.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:01.150
So, you'll speak to him.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.086
Sure.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:12.529
Okay, listen up,
we have just one hour

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.063
before the press arrives.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.500
Careful with those.
They're antiques.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.201
Hey.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.704
Uh, thanks for hosting.

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.207
Well, I'm not planning
on staying. I'm not needed, so I'm--

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.509
Actually, you are.

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:28.111
Um, Hilda wants you on the panel

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.113
as the face of Pure Candles.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.281
Of course she does.

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.400
Hey.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.537
Are you ready? Are you okay?

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.572
I'm fine. Just stressed.

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:58.575
Oh, well, public speaking
used to give me anxiety too.

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:01.277
I'm not anxious,
I'm exhausted.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:04.313
I've been up most
nights worrying. - About what?

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.585
How to avoid a lawsuit, make
thousands of DIY memory candles,

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.253
and be a father
to Olive next year.

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:12.155
Yeah, it's a lot to juggle.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.258
Um, hey, if you need help
with any of it--

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:18.161
Thanks, but I got myself
into this, I need to work out

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.329
a way to handle it on my own.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:33.276
So, I think we have time
for one more question.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.945
- Uh, yes?
- This is a question for Tom.

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:38.682
What does the future hold
for Pure Candles,

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.918
your own candle brand? I mean,
this is a little different

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:44.454
than your locally made products,
isn't it?

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:46.790
Um...

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:52.428
Well, that I'm unsure of.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.363
I...

01:13:58.502 --> 01:14:02.472
Well, um, that's all
the time we have for questions.

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:04.608
But I do have
a final announcement.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:07.644
The Memories by Pure candles

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.847
next year will be mass-produced
by another candlemaker

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.617
under a sister brand,
name to be announced soon.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:22.391
We thank Tom for bringing
his magic to the Goodwell

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.461
and bringing Christmas
memory candles to us all.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.896
So, thank you, Tom.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.332
We are very grateful
for the gift of

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:31.501
handmade products
made with love.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.509
Mm-hmm.

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:50.554
- Thank you again.
- All right. Thank you.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.861
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:15:00.029
You really are
full of surprises.

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:01.998
Yeah, well, it felt like
the right thing to do.

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:03.900
Well, judging by the look
on Hilda's face,

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:06.002
it was the first
she'd heard of it.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.905
Yeah, let's just call it
a spur-of-the-moment decision.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:11.340
Juliet, can we talk?

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.376
Yeah, excuse me.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.545
-How are you doing?
- Okay.

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:18.882
So, what was that stunt
you pulled? We need Pure.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:20.717
Needed. Past tense.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:22.351
Now that the Christmas
drop is done,

01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:24.721
another company would be
a better fit.

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:28.725
I disagree. The Pure brand
association is very valuable.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:32.896
Look, the truth is...
Tom was gonna be a liability.

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:35.565
We wanna go big
and his operation just isn't up for it.

01:15:35.599 --> 01:15:38.401
It was looking too risky.
I was protecting our business.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:41.971
I guess that makes sense.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.575
- Do you have another supplier?
- Yeah, I have options to choose from.

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:47.543
We can decide in the new year.

01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:48.712
All right.

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.314
Smooth things over with Tom.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.718
Increase his one-off payment
and get it processed ASAP.

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:56.920
Well, it looks like

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:59.088
website traffic is
through the roof.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:02.058
Congratulations.
Promotion is yours.

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:07.731
Hey.

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:09.833
Great news. Hilda has
instructed me

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:10.967
to increase
your one-off payment.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.069
It'll be in
your account tomorrow.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:14.337
Thank you.

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:16.640
Is there something wrong?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.643
When you told me you'd use
another supplier next year

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.477
because it was
the right thing to do,

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.779
I believed you.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:24.447
Good, that's the truth.

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:26.650
But you just told Hilda that

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.785
you did it because
I'm a liability.

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.955
No, I was just saying that.

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:35.024
So, you say things behind
my back that you don't mean?

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.126
No, I... I mean,
it's complicated.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.795
I did not mean it.

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:40.997
Another company would
be a better fit.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.633
But you said yourself
Pure wouldn't cope,

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.802
that you were stressed.
I thought this was what you wanted.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.504
It is and I'm grateful.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:49.706
Just...

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.008
I thought you and I could be...

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.944
Be... be what?

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.716
Nothing. I...

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:02.451
I'm not sure I know
who you are and um,

01:17:02.485 --> 01:17:04.854
it feels like you just are
who people want you to be.

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.356
Wow.

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.392
All right.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.695
Um... I'm gonna go.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.742
Senior Vice President.

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:28.177
- Has a nice ring to it.
- Sure does!

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.679
And well deserved.

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.715
I just got off the phone
with the board.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:34.417
Traffic's up, sales are up,
everyone's happy.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.720
Oh, and just in time
for Christmas. - Mm-hmm.

01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:38.888
Well, since everyone's happy,

01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:40.656
do you think I could
ask you a favour

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.692
as the new Senior
Vice President?

01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:44.527
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Well, every year,

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:46.696
the Goodwell makes a donation
to a charity, right?

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.898
We do. It's the last bit
of business before Christmas.

01:17:48.932 --> 01:17:50.700
Do you think the board
would allow me

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.001
to pick the charity this year?

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:54.103
How could they refuse?

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.872
Good!

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:58.674
'Cause I think
I have a great idea.

01:17:58.708 --> 01:17:59.843
I bet you do.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.778
Merry Christmas, Juliet.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.212
Merry Christmas.

01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:11.554
Good morning!

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:14.090
Things look back to normal
around here.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:16.860
Yep. The whole Goodwell mess
is behind me

01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:18.728
and I couldn't be happier.

01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:20.629
You don't look very happy.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.598
What are you talking about?
I'm overjoyed.

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.100
I have money in my account,

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:27.904
collaboration's over,
everything is peachy.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.939
- Peachy?
- Yeah!

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.776
Why are you smiling like that?

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:34.243
I'm happy.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:35.879
Yeah, you said that.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:38.047
Have you spoken to Juliet yet?

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:39.248
Of course not.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:41.584
Tom, she deserves
a simple thank you.

01:18:41.584 --> 01:18:44.087
She did a pretty
great thing for you. - It wasn't for me.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:45.721
Well, she said
that was the reason.

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:47.924
She said a lot of things.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.106
I miss Grandma.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.108
Yeah, me too, sweetie.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:08.978
Yoo-hoo!

01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:11.247
- Surprise!
- Grandma!

01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:13.616
Ah, my baby girl!

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.018
I... I can't believe it.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.752
But what are you doing here?

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.122
Did Mrs. Claus send you?

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:20.756
Who knows?!

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.625
She might have had
something to do with it.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:25.128
She works in mysterious ways.

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:26.662
But how did you get away?

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:29.098
Well, we got a donor
at the 11th hour,

01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:31.868
and I got the last plane ticket.

01:19:31.935 --> 01:19:33.602
It all worked out in the end.

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:35.638
Oh, it's good to see you, Mom.
I missed ya.

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:38.541
Oh, I missed you both so much.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:39.976
Button.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.160
Out of all our Christmas
traditions,

01:19:57.193 --> 01:19:59.662
I think Christmas Eve waffles
might be my favourite.

01:19:59.695 --> 01:20:01.865
I think my favourite
is seeing the three of you

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:04.067
in these ridiculous,
matching Christmas sweaters.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.735
Yes, especially when you make me wear yours.

01:20:07.871 --> 01:20:09.672
And mine is opening

01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:12.641
one present on Christmas Eve.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:15.178
- Can we do that?
- It's a little early yet, Button.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:18.347
Please, Dad,
please can we do it?

01:20:18.381 --> 01:20:20.850
Okay. Which one?

01:20:20.884 --> 01:20:23.586
- This one.
- Who's it from?

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.190
Juliet!

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:29.158
Juliet, huh?

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.864
It's Mrs. Claus!
I love it.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:37.200
Who's Juliet?

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.869
- A friend of Daddy's.
- She's gorgeous.

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:41.037
We love her.

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:43.072
Oh, tell me more.

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:45.041
It's not like that.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.876
We collaborated together
on a project.

01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:50.213
She works for this uh,
wellness and lifestyle company.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:53.082
Oh, it's a super cool company.
A lot of celebs buy their stuff.

01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:55.018
They're only on social media
and online, though,

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.719
so you probably haven't
heard of them.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:59.188
I go online.

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:01.257
I'm hip.
What's it called?

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.893
The Goodwell.

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:07.196
I know the Goodwell,
but not online.

01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:10.066
The Goodwell is our new donor.

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.767
No, that...
that can't be right.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.236
Yes. Yes.

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:18.374
The Goodwell, a wellness
and lifestyle company.

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:21.210
Just made a very
generous donation.

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:22.912
I don't believe it. I...

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:26.049
I do. That was Juliet.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:28.817
- She did this for you.
- No, it's just a coincidence.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:30.419
And how could she have known
that's Mom's charity?

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:31.720
I didn't say...

01:21:33.456 --> 01:21:35.791
You told her about Together.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:39.929
Yeah, when Mrs. Claus
was here, I said that Mom

01:21:39.929 --> 01:21:42.098
couldn't make it because
they had lost a major donor.

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:46.269
Well, I wanna meet this Juliet
and thank her personally.

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:47.903
Well, you can't, Mom.

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:50.439
Tom, the big doofus,
isn't talking to her.

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:52.275
Don't call
your brother a doofus.

01:21:52.308 --> 01:21:55.244
No, it's... it's okay, Mom.
I am a doofus.

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:56.779
Oh, fair enough.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:22:00.016
A complete and total fool.
I... I gotta go.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.118
- Where?
- Uh, I...

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:05.088
I gotta see if I can catch her
before she leaves for Christmas.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.099
Are you okay?

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.134
Yeah, um...

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:21.037
- You ready?
- Let me just go grab my bag.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.472
That must be Felix.

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:26.009
Gotta get my phone charger.

01:22:31.014 --> 01:22:32.281
Oh!

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:36.152
Look who I found.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:40.956
Hi.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:42.691
Hi.

01:22:52.035 --> 01:22:54.203
Uh...

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:55.838
you're on your way out.

01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:58.241
Yeah, we're leaving
any minute.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.909
You two take
all the time you need.

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:04.847
So, I'll, uh,
I should be quick.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.183
Um...

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:10.019
I'm a doofus.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:12.488
What?

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:15.391
I was suspicious,
and stubborn,

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:17.326
- and unreasonable.
- Okay...

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.762
And I understand if
you don't wanna hear me out.

01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:23.532
I should've believed you
when you made things right.

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:26.769
I should've trusted your word,
and I didn't, and I'm sorry.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.438
- You don't need to apologize.
- No, I do.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.374
After all you've done,

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:33.509
making that donation
to my mom's charity,

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:35.010
thank you.

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:40.283
That's Felix.

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:42.518
Uh... sorry.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.887
We should um...
we have to get going.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.789
We wanna beat traffic.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:47.423
Or you could stay.

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:51.360
Spend Christmas Eve with me?

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:54.063
I can't. I can't.

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:55.298
Yes, she can.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.234
Lucy, no.
No, it would be rude of me

01:23:58.267 --> 01:23:59.402
to cancel on your family.

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:01.904
It's not rude.
It's smart.

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:05.141
My uncle ever stops talking,
my mom burns everything she cooks.

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:06.809
So, go.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.277
See the night through.

01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:10.913
I can't believe it, but somehow,

01:24:10.913 --> 01:24:13.982
you and I are both gonna spend
Christmas with someone special.

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.792
Um, no, well, I guess
that's a yes, then.

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:26.061
Great.

01:24:28.164 --> 01:24:29.465
Let's get your coat.

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:48.117
I hope Santa
likes my cookies.

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:50.953
Of course he will.
They're made with love.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:52.988
I haven't done this
in a really long time,

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.491
so thank you all for
including me in the magic.

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:58.527
- Of course!
- Everybody deserves a little Christmas magic.

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:03.031
Oh, I think it's time for somebody to go to bed.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.633
Santa will be here soon.

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:06.635
You'll come back tomorrow,
right?

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:08.036
Of course I will.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.206
- Good.
- I'll tuck her in.

01:25:10.273 --> 01:25:14.009
I'm really, really happy
this all worked out.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.012
- Good night.
- Thanks.

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.149
Uh, I should get going.

01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:22.618
- I'll walk you home.
- Oh no, you don't have to.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:26.155
Of course I do.
And uh... I want to.

01:25:39.335 --> 01:25:41.136
You know, I just realized,

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.539
you're gonna wake up
on Christmas Day all on your own.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.009
You should come straight over
for Christmas morning pancakes.

01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:48.377
Olive made me promise
to remind you.

01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:50.313
I will be there.

01:25:50.346 --> 01:25:52.014
Oh, this isn't the way.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:54.417
Uh, I wanna take a detour.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.584
Come on.

01:26:02.325 --> 01:26:05.027
- I love this place.
- Yeah, me too.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.563
Thank you for today.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.998
I love your family traditions.

01:26:10.032 --> 01:26:12.034
Like the one of you
getting stuck up the chimney

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:15.037
- looking for Santa.
- Yeah, that is a family favourite.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:20.175
I think I made some
new favourite Christmas memories today.

01:26:20.643 --> 01:26:22.177
Me too.

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.380
But not just today.

01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:27.583
The last couple weeks with you.

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:29.218
Like uh...

01:26:29.252 --> 01:26:31.554
like making candles
at the shop with you.

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:33.222
Oh, um...

01:26:33.256 --> 01:26:35.224
walking through
the Christmas market.

01:26:35.258 --> 01:26:36.459
When we made cookies
with Olive.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.227
Yeah, the marshmallow fight.

01:26:38.261 --> 01:26:39.262
Oh.

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:40.929
That was something.

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:42.731
When the power went out.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.301
And when we first met.

01:26:45.368 --> 01:26:46.435
Dreamy Eyes.

01:26:46.469 --> 01:26:47.703
- What did you call me?
- Yeah.

01:26:50.105 --> 01:26:53.442
But I think
my favourite memory is...

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:55.644
is this moment right now.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.714
Me too.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.751
What do you say we come back
here again next Christmas?

01:27:02.785 --> 01:27:05.588
A new Christmas tradition
just for the two of us.

01:27:05.588 --> 01:27:08.257
Oh, that's a leap of faith.

01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:10.158
Planning something so far ahead?

01:27:11.093 --> 01:27:12.661
I thought you liked planning?

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:18.501
Oh, I do, but I don't normally
plan something without data,

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:22.170
and a risk analysis,
and a roadmap.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:25.240
Ooh, well, I guess we'll
just have to wing it, then.

01:27:25.808 --> 01:27:27.443
I guess so.

01:27:28.444 --> 01:27:30.112
Merry Christmas, Juliet.

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:32.014
Merry Christmas, Tom.

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:49.031
* I feel your heart so true

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:57.373
* Your eyes light gently blue

01:27:59.508 --> 01:28:04.780
* Like when we touch the moon

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:12.220
* Never let me go

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:18.494
* You always touch my soul

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:23.566
* I will find something
to say to you *

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.403
* Never let me go

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:36.311
* Let's fly away from here

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:44.553
* Let's dive into the years

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:52.695
* Unfold your broken heart

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:59.702
* And hope we reach the stars

01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:07.275
* Never let me go

01:29:10.613 --> 01:29:13.716
* You always touch my soul

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:18.554
* I will find something
to say to you *

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:22.124
* Never let me go

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.466
* Happy to be around

01:29:30.533 --> 01:29:33.569
* Happy to say I'm here

01:29:34.236 --> 01:29:37.372
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas *

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:41.276
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas *

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.646
* Happy to fly the skies

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:47.149
* Happy to see the world

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:50.419
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas *

01:29:50.453 --> 01:29:53.489
* It's Christmas
It's Christmas *

01:29:53.556 --> 01:29:56.124
* When you're seeing
the world **
