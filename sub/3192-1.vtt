00:31.249 --> 00:35.211
(indistinct shouting)

00:36.497 --> 00:37.644
[Man Filming] Holy shit.

00:37.679 --> 00:40.391
Oh my God.

00:46.577 --> 00:49.567
- This is fucked.
- God damn it!

00:49.601 --> 00:51.582
Ah, fuck!

01:01.175 --> 01:03.086
Maybe I should do it again?

01:04.233 --> 01:06.945
(indistinct shouting)

01:10.906 --> 01:14.696
(indistinct screaming)

01:15.703 --> 01:17.997
It's gone.
Oh, my fucking...

01:18.032 --> 01:19.944
It's fucking...
Oh my God.

01:55.743 --> 01:57.239
(pop)

02:01.444 --> 02:04.642
(light switch clicks)

02:47.982 --> 02:50.938
(distorted music from radio)

02:55.560 --> 02:56.950
(glass breaks)

02:59.418 --> 03:03.033
* Is there anybody home? *

03:05.535 --> 03:07.239
(record skipping)
* Is there anybody... *

03:07.273 --> 03:08.977
* Is there anybody... *

03:09.011 --> 03:10.992
* Is there anybody... *

03:11.027 --> 03:13.007
(clattering)

03:15.302 --> 03:17.492
* I don't care if you... *

03:17.527 --> 03:18.813
(clattering)

03:18.847 --> 03:22.115
* I don't care..., I don't care... *

03:22.149 --> 03:24.582
* I don't care..., I don't care... *

03:24.618 --> 03:27.432
* I don't care..., I don't care... *

03:27.467 --> 03:30.665
* I don't..., I don't...,
I don't..., I don't... *

03:30.699 --> 03:34.940
* Is there someone right behind you? *

03:34.974 --> 03:39.424
(distorted) * Is there
someone right behind you? *

03:39.458 --> 03:41.301
(ghostly whisper)

03:53.604 --> 03:54.856
Fuck!

03:59.027 --> 04:01.946
(ghostly whispers)

04:06.013 --> 04:09.523
(ominous ambience)

04:32.706 --> 04:34.061
(gun clicks)

04:49.494 --> 04:52.622
(squeaking)

05:13.997 --> 05:15.839
(smash)

05:22.895 --> 05:26.057
(seagulls calling)

05:26.093 --> 05:28.559
(upbeat music)

06:07.175 --> 06:08.218
Toby.

06:08.878 --> 06:13.223
Sorry, a dog ate yours,
you can have mine.

06:13.257 --> 06:14.544
Here you go.

06:15.273 --> 06:16.281
Thanks.

06:17.324 --> 06:18.889
God, I just don't get Australian maps.

06:18.923 --> 06:20.695
Do you get any maps?

06:20.730 --> 06:21.947
Just saying.

06:23.025 --> 06:24.276
Give it here.

06:27.021 --> 06:29.385
Well, that's definitely North.

06:34.807 --> 06:35.989
Toby, give me my camera.

06:36.023 --> 06:37.935
You had it last.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.951
No, I gave it to you at the Big Banana.

06:39.985 --> 06:41.967
I mean sometimes I think Mom
and Dad were punishing me

06:42.002 --> 06:43.634
by sending us on a trip together.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.069
Well, at least I'm not adopted.

06:46.103 --> 06:47.284
We could reach the Eiffel tower.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.501
You know maybe you'll lose your passport

06:48.535 --> 06:49.752
and get trapped here.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.178
At least I'm not trapped up your ass.

06:51.213 --> 06:53.054
At least my ass isn't
the size of a house.

06:53.089 --> 06:55.314
Well, at least my dick's
not the size of an ant.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.913
We could go get lunch in Central Park.

06:56.947 --> 06:58.164
You have a dick?

06:58.198 --> 06:59.484
Guys, come on!

07:03.968 --> 07:07.374
Run, Forrest!
(laughs)

07:10.990 --> 07:12.866
You'd be lost without this.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.716
We already are.
(laughs)

07:15.750 --> 07:18.844
Oi, Geordie, the dick's finished!

07:18.878 --> 07:20.929
Yeah, he's not with me.

07:22.494 --> 07:23.641
Thanks.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.689
(laughs)

07:32.817 --> 07:33.894
Okay.

07:36.604 --> 07:38.377
We've got all afternoon
to find the hostel.

07:38.413 --> 07:39.732
Just relax.

07:39.768 --> 07:41.922
Yeah, it'd just be good
to drop our bags.

07:41.957 --> 07:44.391
Toby, tell her we're staying.

07:44.425 --> 07:45.676
We're staying.

07:47.657 --> 07:50.195
- Oi, map girl.
- Oh hey.

07:50.229 --> 07:52.558
- You still lost?
- Hey.

07:52.594 --> 07:54.992
You guys heard of a game called cricket?

07:56.311 --> 07:59.093
(feel-good music)

07:59.127 --> 08:01.978
(indistinct shouting)

08:07.677 --> 08:09.242
Come on, America.

08:11.014 --> 08:14.073
[Amelia] Where are the bases?

08:14.107 --> 08:18.174
Get closer to the wickets!
Like that.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.225
This, no.

08:22.588 --> 08:24.188
Left foot out,

08:24.222 --> 08:27.384
you wanna like take up,
and then swing through.

08:27.420 --> 08:30.270
(playful screams)

08:35.345 --> 08:36.908
No!

08:42.885 --> 08:45.597
Drip, drip, drip.

08:46.466 --> 08:48.759
Every time that she woke scared,

08:48.795 --> 08:51.158
she just put her hand down
to the side of the bed,

08:51.194 --> 08:53.800
so her dog could lick it, making
her feel more comfortable,

08:53.834 --> 08:56.233
so she could go back to sleep.

08:56.268 --> 08:58.770
Drip, drip, drip.

08:59.813 --> 09:01.413
She woke again, but this
time she went to see

09:01.447 --> 09:03.567
where the drip was coming from.

09:03.602 --> 09:06.626
She forget to turn the tap off
or something like that?

09:06.660 --> 09:08.816
No, no.

09:08.850 --> 09:10.101
She forgot to turn the tap off.

09:10.135 --> 09:11.422
No.

09:11.456 --> 09:14.098
She went into the bathroom,

09:14.133 --> 09:17.955
and there in the mirror,
written in blood,

09:17.991 --> 09:20.632
humans can lick, too.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.274
And then hanging from
the shower was her dog.

09:23.309 --> 09:26.228
The drip, drip was its blood.

09:28.174 --> 09:29.425
That's the end.

09:30.364 --> 09:31.372
That's it.

09:31.406 --> 09:34.814
- Pretty scary story.
- Yeah, that was cool.

09:34.848 --> 09:37.802
- What? It was great.
- An American classic.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.714
Nah, it was good.
Why do you guys do that?

09:39.748 --> 09:41.035
Why do Americans do that?

09:41.070 --> 09:42.459
Why do you all sit around campfires

09:42.495 --> 09:43.850
and tell ghost stories?

09:43.884 --> 09:46.422
Well, what else are ya gonna do?

09:46.457 --> 09:48.229
Aw, we just...

09:48.264 --> 09:51.253
We don't do that here, do we?

09:51.288 --> 09:53.165
Well what do you do?

09:54.069 --> 09:55.980
We just sit around the campfire,

09:56.015 --> 09:58.274
telling real stories.

09:58.308 --> 09:59.908
Oh, sorry, real stories.

09:59.943 --> 10:01.890
Okay, give us a real story.

10:01.924 --> 10:03.141
Come on.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.392
Alright, I'll give you a real story.

10:04.426 --> 10:05.955
And no, I don't need the torch.

10:05.990 --> 10:07.658
I don't use special effects

10:07.693 --> 10:11.447
or anything like that
to make my story better.

10:11.482 --> 10:14.436
Okay. This is how my story starts.

10:17.739 --> 10:19.302
It was a dark and stormy night.

10:19.336 --> 10:21.456
[Group] Oh, please.

10:21.492 --> 10:24.968
The academy award for
the best cliche goes to Oscar.

10:25.002 --> 10:25.836
(laughs)

10:25.872 --> 10:28.061
Alright, here it is.

10:28.096 --> 10:29.694
It's about a man, right?

10:29.729 --> 10:31.154
Is he hot?

10:31.953 --> 10:33.934
Is he, I need to know.

10:33.969 --> 10:35.465
I don't know if he's hot.
I don't know if he's hot.

10:35.499 --> 10:36.403
Let's just say he is.

10:36.438 --> 10:38.870
He's hot, thank you.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.477
This guy, he owns a motorbike.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.988
And he's always really
careful on his motorbike,

10:45.022 --> 10:50.444
because he's got two beautiful
young kids and a wife.

10:50.479 --> 10:53.572
So he's driving home this one night.

10:53.607 --> 10:57.743
And he gets to the intersection
at Lemon Tree Passage Road.

10:57.778 --> 11:02.053
It's fine, he looks left,
he looks right,

11:02.088 --> 11:04.591
sees that there's nothing there,

11:04.625 --> 11:06.954
and he just edges forward
just ever so slowly...

11:06.989 --> 11:07.823
Bang!

11:07.857 --> 11:09.282
Oh my God!

11:10.117 --> 11:12.202
(laughs)

11:12.932 --> 11:14.496
He's been hit.

11:14.530 --> 11:15.851
No seriously, he's just been hit

11:15.886 --> 11:18.563
by a car full of fuckin' teenagers.

11:18.597 --> 11:21.725
Right, they've just run this guy over.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.264
So they stop, they stop
to see what they've done,

11:24.298 --> 11:27.600
and you know, they know
they just haven't ran over

11:27.634 --> 11:29.858
some fuckin' kangaroo
or anything like that.

11:29.894 --> 11:31.701
(laughs)
What?

11:31.735 --> 11:33.056
- A kangaroo.
- Toby!

11:33.091 --> 11:34.411
Shut up.

11:34.446 --> 11:38.304
Seriously they've
just killed a dude. Right?

11:38.340 --> 11:39.625
So they take off.

11:39.659 --> 11:41.954
They're teenagers they
don't want the trouble.

11:43.275 --> 11:47.132
It's said that the ghost of this guy

11:47.168 --> 11:49.774
haunts Lemon Tree Passage Road.

11:50.956 --> 11:55.335
And every time a car full
of teenagers goes down it,

11:55.370 --> 11:58.950
a bright light shines on 'em.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.982
All the way.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.543
And that's how you tell a fuckin' story.

12:08.578 --> 12:09.690
(laughs)

12:09.725 --> 12:10.941
A real story.

12:13.548 --> 12:15.565
- Have you seen it?
- Of course I've seen it.

12:15.599 --> 12:17.058
I wouldn't believe it otherwise.

12:17.093 --> 12:19.040
- Then where is it?
- It's like 20 minutes away.

12:19.074 --> 12:20.152
(loud shout)

12:20.186 --> 12:23.732
- [Amelia] Oh my God!
- Jesus, Toby, give it up.

12:23.767 --> 12:27.311
(rock music)

12:27.347 --> 12:29.467
(laughs)

12:35.897 --> 12:38.017
(indistinct chatter)

12:38.051 --> 12:39.790
And what did I say on the drive home?

12:39.824 --> 12:46.080
(indistinct chatter)

12:46.116 --> 12:47.957
(laughter)

12:47.993 --> 12:51.816
[Man on radio] Tomorrow,
it's going to be hot, hot, hot.

12:51.851 --> 12:53.032
Hey!

12:53.067 --> 12:54.109
Whoa!

12:54.804 --> 12:57.099
What, didn't you hear
him say "hot hot hot"?

12:57.133 --> 12:59.983
The Aussie version of mistletoe.

13:00.018 --> 13:02.173
- No it's not!
- Does that ever work for you?

13:02.207 --> 13:05.161
It works all the time,
what's your problem?

13:05.197 --> 13:07.247
- Hey, hey left here.
- What?

13:07.282 --> 13:08.639
- Left here. Left here.
- Here?

13:08.673 --> 13:10.202
Yeah, you'll see.

13:10.236 --> 13:12.740
You're gonna blow your
shit when you see this.

13:12.774 --> 13:15.658
(girls cheer)

13:21.810 --> 13:23.479
It will work, it will work, trust me.

13:23.514 --> 13:26.190
- I need you to go faster, mate.
- Mate, I'm trying.

13:26.225 --> 13:28.032
- Come on, grandma!
- Mate, go faster.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.813
Put your fuckin' foot down
on the pedal, ya pussy.

13:30.848 --> 13:33.142
- [Toby] What're you doing?
- There's nothing there.

13:33.176 --> 13:35.504
- (engine revs)
- [Amelia] I don't see anything.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.243
- Keep your eyes out the back.
- Where am I supposed to be looking?

13:37.277 --> 13:39.154
The faster we go, we're gonna see him.
We're gonna see it.

13:39.190 --> 13:41.309
If we do, you owe me a
kiss then, definitely.

13:41.344 --> 13:42.734
Oh!

13:45.376 --> 13:46.974
Okay, okay, keep looking.

13:47.009 --> 13:48.366
I promise.

13:49.581 --> 13:52.015
130, and any moment now
you're gonna see this...

13:52.049 --> 13:53.926
(screaming)

13:53.960 --> 13:55.211
There it fuckin' is!

13:55.247 --> 13:57.506
What did I say, what did I tell you?

13:57.542 --> 14:01.295
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

14:01.329 --> 14:02.615
I can't see it.

14:02.650 --> 14:04.145
Okay, keep your eyes on it.

14:04.179 --> 14:06.404
We tell real stories here.

14:06.439 --> 14:07.828
Real stories.

14:07.864 --> 14:10.089
- Okay, keep your fuckin' eye on it.
- I can't see it.

14:10.123 --> 14:12.104
You can't see that?
How can you not see that?

14:12.140 --> 14:13.391
It's a car.

14:13.425 --> 14:16.796
Look at it, are you sure it's not a car?

14:16.831 --> 14:18.186
[Oscar] How can that be a car?

14:18.221 --> 14:21.175
(suspenseful music)

14:26.493 --> 14:30.282
It's gonna stay there like that.
Keep the speed up.

14:30.317 --> 14:31.810
Okay now, watch this.

14:31.846 --> 14:33.827
And now it's gonna smack right
into that pole over there.

14:33.861 --> 14:35.739
Wait, wait, wait.

14:35.773 --> 14:37.165
[Amelia] Oh my God!

14:37.199 --> 14:38.901
[Group] Oh!

14:38.936 --> 14:40.152
[Oscar] It just goes.

14:40.188 --> 14:41.960
- That was, like, totally awesome.
- That was insane!

14:41.995 --> 14:44.393
Let's go again, let's go again.

14:44.428 --> 14:46.896
Let's go again!
Let's go again!

14:46.930 --> 14:50.406
How good was that?
How good was that?

14:50.441 --> 14:52.283
That was awesome let's do it again!

14:52.318 --> 14:54.021
[Oscar] Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.

14:54.056 --> 14:55.516
Why don't we go back?

14:55.550 --> 14:57.323
Look, Toby's empty,
let's go back to the house,

14:57.357 --> 14:58.400
he needs a drink.

14:58.435 --> 14:59.686
Yeah, come on, let's go.

14:59.721 --> 15:00.902
[Oscar] Aw.

15:00.938 --> 15:02.919
Yeah, we'll go home, get another drink.

15:02.953 --> 15:05.004
- I'm thirsty!
- Oh my God!

15:10.322 --> 15:14.736
We stayed in this one
hostel in... Melbourne?

15:14.771 --> 15:16.057
Melbourne.

15:16.092 --> 15:17.169
Melbourne.

15:17.204 --> 15:19.254
(laughs)
Whatever.

15:19.290 --> 15:22.244
Yeah, well we had to share a
room with like 20 other people,

15:22.278 --> 15:23.703
and there was this girl who liked to...

15:23.738 --> 15:25.268
Duck wack!

15:25.302 --> 15:28.048
- What?
- Shit, mate, I thought I lost ya.

15:28.082 --> 15:30.898
Maya, Wacky.
Wacky, Maya.

15:30.932 --> 15:32.183
It's very nice to meet you.

15:32.219 --> 15:33.852
She sounds funny doesn't she?

15:35.311 --> 15:38.405
Geez, mate, you are looking haggard.

15:41.255 --> 15:43.793
You're cuter than your friend.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.114
Aw, hey.

15:45.530 --> 15:46.885
Sorry.

15:47.373 --> 15:48.658
I loved him.

15:48.694 --> 15:50.988
Used to take him around
with me everywhere.

15:51.022 --> 15:53.317
Mum thought I got too old.

15:53.351 --> 15:54.464
How old were you?

15:54.498 --> 15:55.297
16.

15:55.332 --> 15:57.522
(laughs)

16:00.790 --> 16:03.292
I should get to the others.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.115
He's wrong, you know.

16:07.150 --> 16:10.659
I'm not boxing myself in down there.

16:10.695 --> 16:14.449
[Man on TV] This radio station
will remain on the air day and night.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.886

16:56.366 --> 16:58.764
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean...

17:00.779 --> 17:02.622
Who the fuck are you?

17:04.532 --> 17:06.792
Sammy, this is, uh, my friend, Maya.

17:06.827 --> 17:10.580
She's traveling with her
friends from America.

17:10.616 --> 17:11.798
Good on them.

17:11.832 --> 17:14.473
Yeah, we were watching a movie.
Did you wanna?

17:14.508 --> 17:15.724
Not really.

19:11.709 --> 19:14.003
(soft cry)

19:26.516 --> 19:28.115
Well, look at you.

19:28.914 --> 19:30.582
Living up to your word?

19:30.617 --> 19:32.146
Excuse me?

19:32.180 --> 19:35.379
Kissing as many hot
Australians as you can get.

19:35.414 --> 19:36.526
Firstly, we didn't.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.499
(giggles)

19:37.533 --> 19:39.236
Secondly you said that.

19:39.271 --> 19:40.452
Really?

19:41.322 --> 19:42.817
That doesn't sound like me.

19:42.851 --> 19:44.138
No, not at all.

19:44.172 --> 19:46.223
(laughs)

19:48.413 --> 19:49.559
Oh, Geordie.

19:50.636 --> 19:52.618
(giggles)

19:52.652 --> 19:54.391
Good night, Amelia.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.214
[Amelia] Oh, Sarah.

19:58.248 --> 20:00.159
- (lips smacking)
- Stop!

20:04.922 --> 20:07.354
(clock ticks)

20:24.491 --> 20:26.193
[Woman whispering] Were you scared?

20:27.688 --> 20:28.939
Were you?

20:32.102 --> 20:33.700
[Woman] It felt good.

20:34.848 --> 20:35.925
Okay.

20:38.775 --> 20:40.791
[Woman] Let's go back.

20:40.825 --> 20:41.903
Why?

20:43.502 --> 20:45.970
(eerie music)

20:50.801 --> 20:53.407
(faint screams)

20:56.397 --> 20:58.586
(creaking)

21:16.451 --> 21:19.475
(distorted speaking, screaming)

21:26.566 --> 21:28.651
[Man] Is this Mom's jewelry?

21:28.685 --> 21:29.832
Is it Mom's jewelry?

21:29.868 --> 21:32.509
(girl screams)

21:43.979 --> 21:47.142
(heavy breathing)

21:47.177 --> 21:50.444
(frantic screams)

21:50.478 --> 21:52.355
(indistinct shouting)

21:52.391 --> 21:54.719
[Man] I'm done!

21:56.978 --> 21:58.751
Get away from me!

21:58.785 --> 22:01.323
You need to get the fuck away from me.

22:01.358 --> 22:04.346
Hey, Maya, Maya, it's okay.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.536
Shh.

22:08.482 --> 22:10.013
Where am I?

22:11.680 --> 22:12.897
You're in the closet.

22:14.148 --> 22:15.434
You okay?

22:16.650 --> 22:19.293
(cries)

22:19.327 --> 22:21.099
I think I had a bad dream.

22:21.134 --> 22:22.942
I think you were just sleepwalking.

22:24.019 --> 22:25.096
Come here.

22:35.384 --> 22:36.601
Come on.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.825
Fucking corker?

22:38.860 --> 22:40.528
Basically, to sound Australian,

22:40.564 --> 22:42.579
you've gotta say fuckin'
in front of everything.

22:42.614 --> 22:44.352
Right, okay.
(laughs)

22:44.386 --> 22:46.854
Alright, fuckin' corker.

22:46.889 --> 22:48.593
(Laughs)
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

22:48.627 --> 22:49.740
Wait, wait, wait, let me have a go.

22:49.774 --> 22:51.059
Okay, alright.

22:52.276 --> 22:53.979
(splash)
(giggles)

22:54.015 --> 22:54.918
Watch it.

22:54.953 --> 22:56.795
Well dry faster than.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.340
Sorry.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.695
That's what Australians
say when they cheers.

23:01.730 --> 23:02.878
Go, give it a go.

23:02.913 --> 23:05.241
Up the bum, no babies.

23:06.283 --> 23:08.855
Do you think you saw
anything last night?

23:09.968 --> 23:11.463
Something.

23:11.497 --> 23:13.409
But not a ghost.

23:13.444 --> 23:14.938
What about you?

23:14.973 --> 23:16.084
No.

23:16.989 --> 23:18.796
Was just a busted street light.

23:19.839 --> 23:21.542
What do I have to do convince you guys?

23:21.576 --> 23:23.732
Stand in the middle of the bloody road?

23:34.436 --> 23:36.488
I can't believe you're
making him do this.

23:36.522 --> 23:37.773
Say something, dude.

23:37.808 --> 23:38.955
[Oscar] Go fuck yourself.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.145
[Toby] (laughs)
Okay, we can hear ya.

23:41.179 --> 23:42.778
Okay, I'm standing here

23:42.814 --> 23:44.759
in the middle of
Lemon Tree Passage Road.

23:44.795 --> 23:48.027
And it's pretty bloody dark, actually.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.208
You're such a weirdo!

23:49.243 --> 23:51.850
Shut the fuck up, this is serious.

23:51.885 --> 23:54.179
Okay we're coming up to you man.

23:54.214 --> 23:55.709
[Oscar] Okay, there's still
no sign of the...

23:55.710 --> 23:57.099
...ghost, but if they
pick up their speed.

23:57.133 --> 24:00.296
Whoa, holy shit, dude.
Dude, you're standing right next to it.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.659
- Where?
- It's right beside you.

24:02.694 --> 24:05.405
Okay, according to reports,

24:05.441 --> 24:08.081
I'm currently standing
next to a real live ghost.

24:08.116 --> 24:09.924
Can you see it?

24:09.958 --> 24:11.071
I can't see it.

24:11.105 --> 24:12.565
[Toby] Dude, it's right fuckin' there.

24:12.599 --> 24:14.754
[Oscar] I'm gonna move, I'll go
over where I can get a better look.

24:14.790 --> 24:16.561
Oh, no mate, don't move.
We won't know where to find ya.

24:16.597 --> 24:19.030
[Oscar] Okay, I'm...
(voice becomes indistinct)

24:22.401 --> 24:23.722
Oscar?

24:24.591 --> 24:26.154
Oscar?

24:26.190 --> 24:27.650
Oscar?

24:28.449 --> 24:29.874
[Toby] What's he doing?

24:29.908 --> 24:31.368
It dropped out.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.245
Okay, call him back.

24:35.088 --> 24:37.520
(phone rings)

24:39.120 --> 24:40.335
[Oscar] Hello?

24:40.371 --> 24:41.656
Hey mate, we're gonna turn around.

24:41.691 --> 24:43.533
- What are you near so we find you?
- [Oscar] Got ya!

24:43.568 --> 24:44.958
This is actually a voice message,

24:44.993 --> 24:47.357
but if you've got nice
tits like Geordie's mother,

24:47.392 --> 24:50.172
you may as well leave a message, ha!

24:50.206 --> 24:52.422
Let's just turn around
and pick him up, yeah?

24:52.423 --> 24:53.160
Yeah.

24:53.196 --> 24:56.254

25:04.875 --> 25:07.411
[Man] Listen man, you're
imagining things, alright?

25:07.446 --> 25:10.644
That's not fucking happening, okay.

25:10.678 --> 25:12.521
It can't be, you know what happened.

25:12.555 --> 25:14.294
Just forget about it.

25:32.124 --> 25:34.556
(eerie music)

25:48.807 --> 25:51.171
(rock music)

25:55.723 --> 25:56.940
You alright?

26:00.451 --> 26:01.736
Hey, Maya.

26:11.781 --> 26:14.561
Maybe we should go looking for Oscar.

26:14.596 --> 26:16.092
Maybe we should.

26:23.217 --> 26:24.502
You have a flashlight?

26:24.538 --> 26:27.666
Oh, Oscar's going to enjoy this.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.322
Here's one, and another one.

26:33.365 --> 26:34.721
Here I think.

26:37.605 --> 26:39.135
There ya are, knock yourselves out.

26:39.170 --> 26:41.672
You guys didn't wanna
come with us did you?

26:41.706 --> 26:44.105
Someone should stay here
in case he comes back.

26:44.141 --> 26:46.434
Well, yeah, how about
you guys stay here,

26:46.469 --> 26:49.075
and we'll go idiot hunting.

26:49.110 --> 26:50.744
Have fun, you guys.

26:54.602 --> 26:55.819
(laughs)

26:55.853 --> 26:57.904
Good luck getting
that chastity belt off.

27:07.531 --> 27:08.992
This is so weird.

27:09.721 --> 27:11.424
(indistinct)

27:11.459 --> 27:14.135
Yeah, would be strange.

27:15.073 --> 27:17.158
Um...

27:17.194 --> 27:18.723
How about this one?

27:18.758 --> 27:20.808
(song on radio changes)

27:22.581 --> 27:23.520
Maybe?

27:23.555 --> 27:24.910
No, no listen.

27:28.003 --> 27:29.636
(laughs) No.

27:29.671 --> 27:30.993
Okay.

27:31.652 --> 27:33.703

27:34.954 --> 27:36.589

27:42.914 --> 27:44.165
I like it.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.007
Aw, come on, you are killing me here.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.084
I'm sorry.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.205
(laughs)

28:04.011 --> 28:05.715
It'll kill ya you know.

Whoa, are you okay?

28:22.468 --> 28:23.579

What the fuck?

28:40.228 --> 28:41.758
[Maya] I don't know.

28:41.793 --> 28:44.329
Just try to stay calm, okay?

28:48.986 --> 28:50.725
Has it gotten cold?

28:52.394 --> 28:55.522
Run it just for a minute,
but we need the battery.

29:04.663 --> 29:07.234
Can you smell something?

29:08.764 --> 29:09.946
Gas!

29:09.980 --> 29:11.371
Shut it off.

29:14.776 --> 29:16.827

29:42.929 --> 29:44.250
Wake up, wake up.

31:29.669 --> 31:31.198
Geordie, I don't know what it means...

31:31.232 --> 31:32.379
[Automated Voice]
You have reached a number...

31:32.414 --> 31:34.360

(phone clatters)

31:52.086 --> 31:53.372

32:13.357 --> 32:16.034
You're cuter than your friend.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.405

32:57.360 --> 32:59.098
Hey, hey, shh.

32:59.132 --> 33:00.905
He's in the car, and it was an accident.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.400
It's okay.

33:02.435 --> 33:03.999
I didn't mean to.

33:04.938 --> 33:06.153
Oscar's in the boot.

33:06.189 --> 33:07.926
He's dead.

33:07.961 --> 33:10.985
Get him out, we've got to get him out.

No, leave it!
Just leave it.

33:14.807 --> 33:17.172

33:25.896 --> 33:27.599
Wait! Help us!

33:28.120 --> 33:29.684
Stop!

33:29.719 --> 33:30.761
Stop!

33:30.797 --> 33:32.117
Help us!

33:34.272 --> 33:35.557
Hello?

33:35.593 --> 33:37.400
What the hell?

33:37.434 --> 33:38.930
Hello?

33:41.605 --> 33:43.066
Hello?

33:52.554 --> 33:55.022
(eerie music)

34:20.081 --> 34:22.445
(asps) Geordie, he's gone!

34:29.952 --> 34:31.447
Where is he?

34:34.436 --> 34:36.139
He was just in here!

34:36.174 --> 34:37.842
He was here, right?

34:38.641 --> 34:40.241
Oscar?

34:41.351 --> 34:42.777
You know, I can't believe you two.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.132
This is so messed up.

34:44.168 --> 34:45.350
You know what?
This is a sick joke.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.565
You guys disgust me.

34:46.601 --> 34:47.540
We're not joking!

34:47.574 --> 34:49.451
Alright, then where is he?

34:49.485 --> 34:50.981
[Amelia] Toby!

34:51.016 --> 34:52.509
[Maya] Amelia, wait!

34:52.545 --> 34:55.186
(ominous music)

35:05.926 --> 35:07.629
Would I lie to you about this?

35:07.665 --> 35:08.950
[Amelia] Well, I don't know
what to believe

35:08.984 --> 35:10.097
from you anymore.

35:10.131 --> 35:11.418
Amelia this isn't a fucking joke.

35:11.452 --> 35:13.225
Yeah, well, I need to find my brother.

35:13.259 --> 35:14.406
Amelia, wait!

35:14.442 --> 35:15.657
Toby!

35:15.693 --> 35:17.708
Just stop, we gotta go back to the car.

35:17.743 --> 35:18.995
He knows where the car is!

35:19.030 --> 35:20.941
I was supposed to be
meeting him ages ago.

35:20.975 --> 35:22.193
Okay, where?

35:22.227 --> 35:25.146
I was supposed to meet
him where I left him.

35:25.181 --> 35:26.258
Stop, we need to get back to the car.

35:26.294 --> 35:28.066
Cause Oscar's...

35:28.101 --> 35:29.248
We need to figure this out!

35:29.282 --> 35:31.543
I need to find my brother.

35:36.477 --> 35:37.868
Hey, guys.

35:46.175 --> 35:47.843
Maya, what are you doing?

35:47.877 --> 35:49.720
The light over there.

35:49.754 --> 35:51.109
What light?

35:51.145 --> 35:53.786
I thought I saw Toby's flashlight.

35:53.821 --> 35:55.142
Maya, stop.

35:55.976 --> 35:57.331
I don't know what you saw,

35:57.366 --> 35:59.625
but I didn't see his torch.

36:03.867 --> 36:05.256
I need to pee.

36:07.828 --> 36:09.914
Just go behind that bush, quick.

36:25.623 --> 36:28.057
[Oscar on recording]
Alright, give this one a go.

36:28.092 --> 36:30.455
Up the bum, no baby.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.765
Go fuck yourself.

36:36.259 --> 36:40.117
Okay, I'm standing here in
the middle of Lemon Tree...

36:40.152 --> 36:41.543
No, I can't see it!

36:41.577 --> 36:43.628
Ah, hang on, I'm gonna move.

36:43.663 --> 36:46.408
I'll go over where I
can get a better look.

36:46.443 --> 36:50.614
Okay, I'm walking to the edge of
the woods... (distorted noise).

36:52.317 --> 36:54.576
(screams)

36:55.861 --> 36:59.059
(ghostly voice, laughter)

37:01.701 --> 37:03.509
Listen to this, it's Oscar.

37:03.544 --> 37:05.664
- Where did you get that?
- Just play it.

37:07.401 --> 37:08.583
Play it!

37:14.561 --> 37:15.708
It's busted.

37:17.968 --> 37:19.497
You know what, I am so tired of...

37:19.531 --> 37:21.478
It was Oscar!
Someone was hurting him.

37:21.513 --> 37:22.972
Maya, slow.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.449
We're all tired and scared, okay?

37:26.483 --> 37:28.499
Sometimes it can affect your mind.

37:30.828 --> 37:31.975
I didn't imagine it, it was a...

37:32.009 --> 37:33.817
Just shut up, okay?

37:38.682 --> 37:40.803
(distant scream)

37:45.426 --> 37:47.789
[Geordie] Where's that coming from?

37:47.824 --> 37:49.180
Toby!

37:49.215 --> 37:51.717
(ghostly whispers) Toby!

37:51.751 --> 37:53.802
[Ghostly Voice] Amelia.

37:57.522 --> 37:59.536
(gasps)

38:01.552 --> 38:04.472
(heavy breathing)

38:24.319 --> 38:26.439
(groans)

38:49.934 --> 38:52.124
Help!

38:52.159 --> 38:54.314
(scream)

39:10.406 --> 39:12.075
It's Toby's shoes.

39:15.238 --> 39:16.419
Toby!

39:16.454 --> 39:18.157
Shh!
(flapping)

39:19.234 --> 39:21.285
(bird calling)

39:38.420 --> 39:40.854
(eerie music)

40:32.606 --> 40:34.205
[Amelia] No!

40:34.726 --> 40:36.811
(cries)

40:40.497 --> 40:41.886
Oh, no.

40:51.723 --> 40:54.399
(screams)

40:54.433 --> 40:56.172
Toby, wake up!

40:56.206 --> 40:58.188
(cries)

41:08.893 --> 41:11.708
(distorted noise)

41:12.438 --> 41:14.523
(gasps)

41:26.202 --> 41:28.774
(high-pitched scream)

41:28.808 --> 41:29.885
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.032
We gotta get out of here.

41:31.068 --> 41:32.875
Come on. Come on.

41:35.343 --> 41:36.907
No, no.

41:36.942 --> 41:39.653
(cries)

41:39.688 --> 41:42.085
(suspenseful music)

41:42.121 --> 41:43.719
Run!

42:01.516 --> 42:03.566
Mate! Mate, stop.

42:39.955 --> 42:45.518
(radio flipping through channels)

42:54.449 --> 42:56.500
(radio stops)

43:13.531 --> 43:15.026
(car stalls)

43:15.060 --> 43:16.625
Fuck!

43:20.830 --> 43:23.784
(suspenseful music)

43:40.954 --> 43:43.805
(ghostly whispers)

43:46.829 --> 43:49.574
(somber music)

44:15.051 --> 44:16.823
So, what Oscar said...

44:18.527 --> 44:20.925
The guy on the bike.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.420
It's not real.

44:22.454 --> 44:24.226
But I saw it.

44:25.234 --> 44:27.111
Tell us the story again.

44:30.796 --> 44:33.959
A guy was knocked off his
bike by a bunch of kids.

44:33.994 --> 44:36.253
It's a warning not to speed.

44:45.046 --> 44:46.436
[Amelia] But you saw it?

44:46.472 --> 44:48.140
[Geordie] No.

44:48.174 --> 44:50.085
The 26th of November.

44:50.747 --> 44:52.102
That's today.

44:57.976 --> 44:59.678
[Amelia] Why is he after us?

44:59.714 --> 45:01.243
[Geordie] It's just
a stupid ghost story,

45:01.278 --> 45:02.668
he's not after us.

45:05.830 --> 45:08.090
But how do you know that?

45:15.042 --> 45:16.641
You're exhausted.

45:18.692 --> 45:20.324
Why don't you just rest?

45:21.124 --> 45:23.766
(somber music)

45:40.935 --> 45:42.743
It's the wrong story.

45:57.063 --> 45:59.913
(fire crackling)

46:06.203 --> 46:09.123
(ghostly whispers)

46:34.740 --> 46:36.685
(laugh)

46:36.720 --> 46:39.674
(ghostly whispers)

47:04.734 --> 47:06.264
(whoosh)

47:06.299 --> 47:08.349
(gasps)

47:10.434 --> 47:12.764
(eerie music)

48:13.763 --> 48:14.909
(whimpers)

48:14.944 --> 48:16.646
[Man] Everyone wants in, right?

48:16.681 --> 48:18.697
But you don't just get in.

48:18.731 --> 48:20.748
(indistinct babbling)

48:20.782 --> 48:22.833
(woman crying)

48:28.081 --> 48:30.063
(claps)

48:30.097 --> 48:31.697
(woman screams)

48:31.731 --> 48:33.191
Stop!

48:34.129 --> 48:36.875
What the fuck is wrong with you?

48:38.092 --> 48:39.865
Make them fucking stop!

48:39.899 --> 48:41.116
Maya.

48:45.217 --> 48:46.468
I caught her sleepwalking last night,

48:46.503 --> 48:48.484
she's probably doing the same thing.

48:49.457 --> 48:52.481
(suspenseful music)

50:08.773 --> 50:10.997
(ghostly whisper)

50:18.330 --> 50:19.930
Who's there?

50:24.448 --> 50:28.027
(suspenseful music)

50:28.063 --> 50:30.774
(ghostly whisper)

50:31.608 --> 50:33.485
Who's out there?

50:43.981 --> 50:46.241
Come out so I can blow
ya fuckin' head off.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.985
(faint screams)

51:05.252 --> 51:07.824
(eerie music)

51:28.261 --> 51:30.381
(thunder)

51:30.417 --> 51:33.197
(ghostly whispers)

51:38.550 --> 51:40.009
No, no.

51:40.044 --> 51:42.025
(cries)

51:44.979 --> 51:47.622
[Whispering Voice] Your brother is here.

51:47.656 --> 51:48.977
Geordie?

51:49.011 --> 51:50.750
[Whispering Voice] She'll kill him.

51:50.784 --> 51:53.808
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

51:55.025 --> 51:56.831
[Whispering Voice] She's here.

51:56.867 --> 51:58.396
She lives here.

51:58.430 --> 51:59.751
(Cries) Who?

51:59.785 --> 52:03.609
[Whispering Voice]
You know who, Brianna.

52:03.644 --> 52:05.556
No, no, no, no.

52:05.591 --> 52:06.807
(Ghostly whisper)

52:06.842 --> 52:08.476
Stop, stop, stop, stop,

52:08.510 --> 52:10.666
I'll do whatever you want!

52:15.392 --> 52:18.346
(heavy breathing)

52:57.622 --> 52:59.707
She was in a closet,
she was scared out of her...

52:59.742 --> 53:01.167
Look!

53:01.758 --> 53:03.391
Maya.

53:09.161 --> 53:11.732
(soft music)

53:28.869 --> 53:31.927
Was she stripping
her clothes off last night, too?

53:34.359 --> 53:35.610
Maya!

53:36.757 --> 53:38.079
Maya!

53:38.704 --> 53:40.025
Maya!

53:40.964 --> 53:42.528
Maya!

53:42.563 --> 53:44.196
Maya, no!

53:47.568 --> 53:49.235
No!

53:49.270 --> 53:50.696
Get the life ring.

53:51.634 --> 53:53.615
(splash)

54:16.729 --> 54:18.223
Come on.

54:28.164 --> 54:29.763
(grunts)

54:34.351 --> 54:35.915
(screams)

54:35.949 --> 54:37.479
Shh.

54:37.514 --> 54:39.946
(screams)

54:39.981 --> 54:42.693
(ominous music)

55:11.853 --> 55:15.085
If I let go, you promise me
you're not gonna scream?

55:15.121 --> 55:16.545
Yeah?

55:16.580 --> 55:18.179
Promise?

55:18.214 --> 55:19.708
Help!

55:19.743 --> 55:21.758
Help!

55:23.114 --> 55:24.540
See?

55:25.444 --> 55:27.284
You see what you did?

55:29.683 --> 55:31.143
Come on.

55:35.522 --> 55:37.156
(grunts)

55:48.243 --> 55:51.094
Oh my God, Sam.

56:01.729 --> 56:03.050
Sam.

56:03.779 --> 56:05.760
(cries)

56:11.148 --> 56:13.059
What are you doing?

56:15.667 --> 56:17.683
Keeping an eye on you.

56:28.319 --> 56:30.994
You gonna tell me why you're out here?

56:38.780 --> 56:40.866
Why the fuck you out here?

56:46.496 --> 56:48.651
Okay, you don't wanna talk?

56:51.363 --> 56:52.614
Let's try this.

56:55.810 --> 56:57.861
I'm out here looking for Geordie.

56:59.008 --> 57:02.206
So, why the fuck
are you out here? Here?!

57:02.241 --> 57:04.083
Oh my God, you're a freak!

57:04.118 --> 57:06.065
(cries)

57:11.347 --> 57:12.633
Geordie.

* You know where you can find me *

58:28.126 --> 58:31.567
* Is there anybody home? *

58:32.574 --> 58:36.606
* Take a look inside the window *

58:38.622 --> 58:41.716
* And I don't need to know *

58:41.750 --> 58:44.218
[Man] Alright, I'll do it, I'll do it.

58:46.581 --> 58:49.119
You're struggling like a little
fuckin' animal, aren't ya?

58:49.153 --> 58:50.752
No, don't touch me!

58:50.786 --> 58:52.525
(screams)

58:52.559 --> 58:54.471
Let me go!

58:55.653 --> 58:59.684
* Is there someone right behind you? *

58:59.720 --> 59:02.986
* Are you ready for the fall? *

59:03.021 --> 59:05.384
- (woman screaming)
- Tie the legs up.

59:05.420 --> 59:10.320
* Do you know where you can find me? *

59:10.355 --> 59:16.403
* And I don't need
to hold it close to be free *

59:16.438 --> 59:17.619
(screams)

59:17.654 --> 59:19.323
[Man] Round the neck it goes.

59:22.555 --> 59:23.563
Beautiful!

59:23.598 --> 59:25.405
(rips)

59:25.440 --> 59:27.107
Come on, suck it up.

59:29.784 --> 59:33.851
(screaming, struggling)

59:36.457 --> 59:40.454
(indistinct speech)

59:41.601 --> 59:44.869
(dramatic music)

59:49.108 --> 59:51.090

01:01:10.823 --> 01:01:13.568
(gasps for air)

01:01:16.383 --> 01:01:18.539
(coughs)

01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:45.961
I got you.

01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:47.596
Come here.

01:01:48.222 --> 01:01:50.132
Okay, come on, let's go.

01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:52.253
(gasping)

01:01:54.374 --> 01:01:55.555
Let's go.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:59.239
It's okay. Okay.

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:02.854
Come here, get warm, get warm.

01:02:03.688 --> 01:02:05.460
Where's Amelia?

01:02:05.495 --> 01:02:07.546
She's...

01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:09.561
(gasps)

01:02:09.597 --> 01:02:13.664
(suspenseful music)

01:02:33.856 --> 01:02:38.931
(ghostly whisper)

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.616
Come on, come on.

01:02:42.651 --> 01:02:44.667
- Where was she?
- She was here.

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:49.776
Amelia!

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.027
Wait, wait, wait. I saw
something down there.

01:02:52.028 --> 01:02:52.766
What?

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.336
I don't know, it was like a
vision or something, I don't know.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.804
Wait, wait, wait!
Listen to me, you're not safe.

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.056
I'm safe, Amelia isn't!

01:02:59.091 --> 01:03:02.184
No, there's this girl, okay?
They dumped her out there.

01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:04.860
All of this shit that's happening
to us, it's happened to her.

01:03:04.895 --> 01:03:07.432
- Come, Maya.
- No, but listen, listen, listen.

01:03:09.657 --> 01:03:11.081
Police are searching for a Sydney girl

01:03:11.117 --> 01:03:13.167
who went missing from
a Newcastle Night Club

01:03:13.202 --> 01:03:15.948
on Saturday the 26th of November.

01:03:15.982 --> 01:03:17.755
The 26th of November, that's today!

01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:20.570
- We don't have time for this!
- That's her, Brianna.

01:03:20.605 --> 01:03:22.969
If we don't find Amelia...

01:03:24.116 --> 01:03:26.167
Oh my God, you're right!

01:03:26.201 --> 01:03:27.383
[Sam] Geordie?

01:03:38.645 --> 01:03:39.860
Geordie?

01:03:44.622 --> 01:03:47.055
I saw your car on the road, bro.

01:03:49.905 --> 01:03:53.694
Bumped into your, uh, American friend.

01:03:53.728 --> 01:03:56.788
(ghostly whispers)

01:04:01.966 --> 01:04:03.425
Geordie?

01:04:09.473 --> 01:04:10.898
What's that?

01:04:10.933 --> 01:04:13.297
(faint music)

01:04:13.331 --> 01:04:14.686
It's music.

01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:22.681
- What the fuck is Sam doing here?
- Huh?

01:04:22.716 --> 01:04:24.175
Sam's car.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.469
(faint music)

01:04:40.685 --> 01:04:42.944
Well he can't have gone far.

01:04:43.952 --> 01:04:46.872
- Maya?
- Amelia?

01:04:46.906 --> 01:04:48.610
- Maya!
- Amelia!

01:04:50.592 --> 01:04:52.259
Oh my God!

01:04:57.403 --> 01:05:01.088
- You're okay?
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:05:01.123 --> 01:05:03.139
What the fuck happened?

01:05:03.173 --> 01:05:05.432
Oh my God, it's Sam.

01:05:05.467 --> 01:05:07.726
We gotta get out of here,
he's got a gun.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.429
Geordie untie her!

01:05:11.063 --> 01:05:13.426
You're gonna be okay, I promise.
I promise you.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.817
C'mon, hurry!

01:05:14.851 --> 01:05:17.215
I can't get it.
Check the car for a knife.

01:05:17.249 --> 01:05:18.570
I'll be back.

01:05:18.604 --> 01:05:20.655
(murmuring)

01:05:46.827 --> 01:05:49.260
- Can't see it.
- [Oscar] You can't see?

01:05:49.296 --> 01:05:51.485
[Amelia] It's already following us!

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.266
- [Oscar] Look at it.
- Has it gotten cold?

01:05:54.301 --> 01:05:56.455
He's in the car and it was an accident.

01:05:56.491 --> 01:05:58.158
Have fun, you guys.

01:06:13.139 --> 01:06:16.302
(ghostly whispering)

01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:21.897
Don't you fucking dare.

01:06:32.185 --> 01:06:35.383
(high-pitched whine)

01:06:52.448 --> 01:06:53.874
Help!

01:06:54.429 --> 01:06:56.759
No!

01:06:56.794 --> 01:06:58.496
No, Amelia!

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.581
Amelia, please.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.910
(crying out indistinctly)

01:07:02.945 --> 01:07:04.892
(cries)

01:07:04.926 --> 01:07:07.116
(groans)

01:07:09.272 --> 01:07:10.488
No!

01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:14.345
(crying out indistinctly)

01:07:30.473 --> 01:07:33.463
No. No!

01:07:33.497 --> 01:07:34.852
Shit.

01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:38.780
No, no!

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.977
(cries)

01:07:42.013 --> 01:07:44.967
(intense music)

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.338
Amelia, please.

01:07:48.373 --> 01:07:50.563
(cries)

01:07:53.413 --> 01:07:54.872
[Sam] Geordie?

01:07:57.305 --> 01:07:58.834
Come on, come on, come on.

01:07:58.869 --> 01:08:00.051
No, no.

01:08:00.642 --> 01:08:03.527
(suspenseful music)

01:08:44.435 --> 01:08:47.006
(distorted noise)

01:08:52.639 --> 01:08:58.999
[Maya] (with an Australian accent)
You are looking... haggard.

01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:05.810
What?

01:09:08.522 --> 01:09:10.469
Nothing to say?

01:09:11.823 --> 01:09:15.194
Your funny friend was a lot more chatty.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.366
It's okay.

01:09:29.238 --> 01:09:30.767
Can you see this?

01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:37.787
I'm not crazy, am I?

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:42.550
You can see it?

01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:48.145
You can feel it?

01:09:56.244 --> 01:09:58.989
Maybe not as sharp as I remember.

01:10:05.732 --> 01:10:06.983
Maya?

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:11.189
It's me.

01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:13.622
It's Geordie.

01:10:18.523 --> 01:10:19.843
Maya.

01:10:22.728 --> 01:10:25.160
Maya, it's a weird name.

01:10:28.116 --> 01:10:29.506
Nice legs, though.

01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:34.268
What did you do to Oscar?

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:40.038
Same thing that's gonna happen to you.

01:10:41.531 --> 01:10:43.513
Well, a little different.

01:10:44.972 --> 01:10:47.927
That was more of a gassing thing.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:53.663
Or would you prefer to be strangled?

01:10:55.748 --> 01:10:58.945
Have something shoved down your throat?

01:11:02.039 --> 01:11:06.800
Play a little bit of... noosey, noosey.

01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:19.417
Who are you?

01:11:50.038 --> 01:11:51.497
Okay.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:57.406
- What do you...
- Drop it.

01:11:57.441 --> 01:11:59.874
Sam, what the fuck are you doing here?

01:12:01.265 --> 01:12:02.654
Hi.

01:12:05.782 --> 01:12:07.451
You got old.

01:12:10.615 --> 01:12:11.830
Boo.

01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.020
No, no, no, don't.

01:12:14.055 --> 01:12:15.271
I've got to.

01:12:16.418 --> 01:12:20.172
You know your brother
here and I go way back.

01:12:20.207 --> 01:12:22.153
Don't listen to her, mate.

01:12:23.335 --> 01:12:25.455
I'm offended.

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:28.896
That's very rude
to forget anniversaries.

01:12:30.773 --> 01:12:32.928
Five years, what is that now?

01:12:33.831 --> 01:12:36.821
Ruby, diamond?

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.019
It's wood.

01:12:41.513 --> 01:12:43.946
Isn't that appropriate?

01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:46.379
What's she talking about, Sam?

01:12:46.414 --> 01:12:51.349
Yeah, Sam, better tell him
what's going on.

01:12:53.955 --> 01:12:55.416
Fuck you.

01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:57.119
Let me.

01:12:58.092 --> 01:13:01.394
It was a dark and stormy night...

01:13:02.263 --> 01:13:05.113
and you fucking killed me!

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:09.944
Weren't you listening to my story?

01:13:09.978 --> 01:13:12.551
I said, it was a dark and stormy night.

01:13:12.585 --> 01:13:14.289
- What're you talking about?
- It's nothing, mate.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.165
Nothing?

01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:23.951
Just a bit of fun.

01:13:28.608 --> 01:13:30.798
I wanna hear you say it.

01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:42.094
Okay, fine.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.984
We're waiting.

01:13:51.374 --> 01:13:53.633
You have ruined my life.

01:13:53.668 --> 01:13:55.198
Ruined your life?

01:14:02.566 --> 01:14:04.374
That's an idea.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:14.940
I've never had an audience before.

01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:21.161
One last thing.

01:14:24.532 --> 01:14:26.409
Do you enjoy the light?

01:14:29.746 --> 01:14:31.831
If you see it, you're dead.

01:14:34.473 --> 01:14:38.330
If you don't, well I like your legs.

01:14:44.101 --> 01:14:47.194
You know I really enjoy
these anniversaries.

01:14:48.619 --> 01:14:51.365
I'm so glad that you could make it.

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:56.334
Did you bring me a present?

01:14:56.370 --> 01:14:59.498
Sam, you've gotta turn yourself in.

01:14:59.533 --> 01:15:00.749
What?

01:15:00.784 --> 01:15:02.382
Have her kill you too?

01:15:02.417 --> 01:15:06.136
I didn't expect it
to be wrapped or anything.

01:15:07.734 --> 01:15:09.716
I love surprises.

01:15:16.355 --> 01:15:17.676
Tell you what.

01:15:19.274 --> 01:15:22.124
I'll make it a little easier for you.

01:15:23.516 --> 01:15:29.042
I'll turn around,
and count back from five, hm?

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:37.175
- Five, four...
- What are you doing?

01:15:37.209 --> 01:15:38.807
You can't bury this, Sam.

01:15:38.843 --> 01:15:40.164
...three...

01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:42.284
Geordie just close your eyes, mate.

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:45.238
- No, no what are you doing?
- ...two...

01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:46.732
- [Geordie] Sam, stop.
- ...one...

01:15:46.768 --> 01:15:48.019
- I'm sorry.
- Sam! No, Sam!

01:15:48.053 --> 01:15:49.478
(gunshot)

01:16:32.543 --> 01:16:34.141
(gasps)

01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:36.400
Leave him!

01:16:37.652 --> 01:16:39.250
Ah!

01:16:51.832 --> 01:16:53.431
What have I done?

01:16:55.621 --> 01:16:57.010
Maya?

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.096
(cries)

01:17:01.425 --> 01:17:02.885
No.

01:17:04.449 --> 01:17:05.560
Well, who?

01:17:05.596 --> 01:17:08.203
Sam... Sam did it.

01:17:21.897 --> 01:17:23.218
Are you okay?

01:17:28.779 --> 01:17:30.517
What happened to me?

01:17:33.471 --> 01:17:35.105
It wasn't you.

01:17:57.592 --> 01:17:59.504
I don't understand.

01:18:00.269 --> 01:18:01.763
Why did he...?

01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:07.221
He ended it.

01:18:44.242 --> 01:18:48.585
* I go nowhere high *

01:18:48.621 --> 01:18:52.271
* Go nowhere warm *

01:18:54.182 --> 01:18:59.161
* Until I see your smile *

01:18:59.196 --> 01:19:03.157
* And feel your calm *

01:19:07.285 --> 01:19:11.978
* And I lick a dime *

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:16.079
* I crave for you, boy *

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.527
* You're like a parachute *

01:19:20.563 --> 01:19:24.594
* Descending from the sky *

01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:35.730
* But I'm sure you're on your way *

01:19:37.624 --> 01:19:40.440
* Yes I'm sure *

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:45.619
* you're on the run *

01:19:46.878 --> 01:19:54.385
* And I reckon there is
nothing more to say *

01:20:03.163 --> 01:20:08.064
* Do you know where you can find me? *

01:20:08.098 --> 01:20:12.026
* Is there anybody home? *

01:20:12.999 --> 01:20:17.135
* Take a look inside the window *

01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:24.260
* And I don't need
to know that I'm gonna win *

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:34.688
* And I don't care
if you reset to begin *

01:20:36.043 --> 01:20:40.596
* Is there someone right behind you? *

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:45.531
* Are you ready for the fall? *

01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:50.849
* Do you know where you can find me? *

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:58.844
* And I don't need
to hold it close to be free *

01:21:04.857 --> 01:21:09.201
