WEBVTT

02:06.501 --> 02:08.419
What happened?

02:08.503 --> 02:10.171
Stay calm, everyone!

02:10.255 --> 02:11.214
Look!

02:11.297 --> 02:13.925
That's Praetorian!

02:14.926 --> 02:16.845
I've met you somewhere before.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.806
You've got the wrong guy…

02:21.391 --> 02:22.350
It's not working.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.898
I knew it.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.359
It was that woman
who was controlling my powers.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.529
One of them was still here.

02:35.196 --> 02:39.826
It's Praetorian! Of all of them,
why the one with 200 different powers?

02:41.202 --> 02:44.289
I get it. So there's no evidence.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.167
It appears they were quite clever.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.295
Now it's time to take care of this.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.589
No way! Honey!

02:54.048 --> 02:55.925
-Take that!
-Honey!

03:02.015 --> 03:02.932
You okay?

03:03.516 --> 03:04.809
Splash Body…

03:05.393 --> 03:07.645
Normal setting. This won't do.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.189
Let's run while we've got the chance!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.567
What luck!

03:18.531 --> 03:19.866
Are you all right?

03:19.949 --> 03:21.784
-Me?
-No! Honey!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.244
She's just passed out!

03:27.373 --> 03:29.042
Don't think you can get away.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.794
-Praetorian in the flesh! What a stud!
-Wow!

03:31.878 --> 03:33.421
I never thought I'd see him up close!

03:35.757 --> 03:38.092
Okay. You take care of my honey.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.177
What will you do?

03:39.928 --> 03:43.264
We've got to buy Ghost some time.

03:43.848 --> 03:48.228
This guy doesn't even know
what kind of power he'll use against you!

03:48.311 --> 03:49.646
That's right,

03:49.729 --> 03:53.191
but I owe this jerk one.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.276
What do we have next?

04:00.698 --> 04:02.242
Doesn't he care who he hits?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.955
Laser Eyes! Nice!

04:21.386 --> 04:23.471
You lose! Iron Body!

04:24.138 --> 04:25.473
You bastard!

04:29.936 --> 04:32.146
Die!

04:52.959 --> 04:54.669
Seriously?

04:54.752 --> 04:56.170
Give me a break.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.548
Where is it?

05:01.217 --> 05:02.510
Where is this treasure?

05:06.764 --> 05:07.598
"Danger"?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.934
Then this must be the place.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.939
Seriously?

05:16.065 --> 05:16.899
Next…

05:17.775 --> 05:18.651
Fire Bomb!

05:26.326 --> 05:28.953
There isn't much time, Ghost!

05:41.549 --> 05:45.053
Help! Someone!

05:55.229 --> 05:56.272
It's The Flare II!

05:56.355 --> 05:57.732
I'm here to save you!

06:00.526 --> 06:01.360
Paragon!

06:01.444 --> 06:02.695
Ruby Red!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.781
Oh, my gosh! What's going on?

06:04.864 --> 06:07.450
What is this? Call of Duty zombie mode?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.626
Look! Who's that?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.294
It's The Utopian!

06:19.462 --> 06:20.963
And Lady Liberty!

06:21.964 --> 06:23.883
We will take care of this.

06:23.966 --> 06:24.842
Right.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.774
Everyone, we've arrived now,
so everything will be fine.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.573
Leave this to us!

06:48.699 --> 06:50.243
They're kicking our butts.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.744
I'm just getting started.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.047
What's it like inside?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.632
It's full of zombies.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.510
Ruby Red evacuated everyone left inside.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.178
But there's no end to them.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.099
I'll handle…

07:20.022 --> 07:22.191
What putrid, rotten scum!

07:23.526 --> 07:25.987
There are a lot of them,
but they don't put up a fight.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.029
I've had it!

07:34.328 --> 07:35.163
What's going on?

07:39.167 --> 07:42.670
I changed the molecular makeup
of the zombies' clothes into steel.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.921
Nice work!

07:44.005 --> 07:46.591
Awesome, Molecule Master!

07:55.433 --> 07:58.728
It appears that someone is animating them.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.854
So it seems.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.066
Over there!

08:10.031 --> 08:12.617
He's the ringleader, right, Dad?

08:20.666 --> 08:21.792
Stop!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.093
The Necromancer!

08:37.808 --> 08:40.978
You won't be laughing for long!

08:41.812 --> 08:43.064
Look at that!

08:43.147 --> 08:47.985
The Necromancer returned from hell,
but our Utopian is facing off against him!

08:48.069 --> 08:50.238
It's a battle for retribution.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.697
For what?

08:51.781 --> 08:52.949
Didn't you know?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.784
The Necromancer is one of the villains

08:54.867 --> 08:59.372
that The Utopian once captured and locked
away in Supermax a long time ago.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.707
Seriously? Nice!

09:01.791 --> 09:02.833
All right then…

09:04.669 --> 09:06.379
Let's spice things up!

09:07.338 --> 09:08.256
What?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.136
It's dangerous here. Get out of here now.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.514
Uh, right. Sorry.

09:18.849 --> 09:22.311
You there. Haven't I seen you before?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.354
Let's go!

09:24.480 --> 09:29.527
Hey! Wait up! How come?
It's just getting good!

09:29.610 --> 09:33.823
Come on! That guy caught me
the other day in Florida!

09:37.743 --> 09:38.828
There's been an explosion!

09:38.911 --> 09:41.539
What's going on at the headquarters?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.377
Ouch…

09:49.005 --> 09:50.590
What the heck's going on?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.262
That was close! That guy never gives up.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.851
How pitiful.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.230
I'm just a little thief.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.190
Do you really have to go this far?

10:10.818 --> 10:12.445
I hate holding back.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.115
This is you guys' HQ, right?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.200
I don't care.

10:18.284 --> 10:22.371
I don't know what you snuck in here for,
but give it up.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.915
Otherwise, you'll die!

10:25.791 --> 10:28.419
Fuck you, you playing-card freak!

10:29.670 --> 10:30.880
Then you're through!

10:33.132 --> 10:34.592
You're toast--

10:36.886 --> 10:37.720
Not again!

10:44.560 --> 10:45.770
You found it?

10:45.853 --> 10:46.896
Nice work!

10:46.979 --> 10:49.315
Now put it on and say the magic word!

10:49.398 --> 10:51.609
Yeah, I found it, but I ain't doin' that!

10:51.692 --> 10:54.820
This thing is cursed!
Let's just get outta here--

10:54.904 --> 10:56.197
Hurry it up, Ghost!

10:56.280 --> 10:57.907
What did you come down here for?

10:57.990 --> 11:01.661
Just do it! If you don't hurry,
playing-card freak will find us!

11:01.744 --> 11:03.245
Fine! I will.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.206
What's the magic word?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.125
-I don't know.
-What?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.002
Seriously? We're through!

11:10.086 --> 11:12.630
I can't think of anything. What'll we do?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.090
Think, Ghost!

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
Are you fucking…

11:18.844 --> 11:19.678
Is this it?

11:19.762 --> 11:22.264
That's it! Nice work!

11:22.348 --> 11:23.391
Oh, shut up.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.976
Okay! Hurry up and put it on
and say the magic word!

11:26.060 --> 11:28.187
Wait a minute! Why do I gotta do this?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.485
I missed?

11:34.568 --> 11:35.694
Ghost!

11:35.778 --> 11:38.030
I'm doing it! Let's see…

11:38.697 --> 11:43.369
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

11:47.415 --> 11:49.083
What's that?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.544
Good! Now make a wish!

11:51.627 --> 11:56.549
What? Take us somewhere
far away that's safe…

11:56.632 --> 11:57.925
To Black Rock!

12:07.268 --> 12:08.310
They disappeared.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.771
It's about time to end this.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.442
Yeah, but what do we do next?

12:14.525 --> 12:15.776
What? I don't know.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.550
Dad took him down.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.265
May you return to hell.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.527
Headquarters was attacked?

13:03.532 --> 13:06.035
What? What happened? What's going on?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.077
Honey!

13:07.786 --> 13:09.330
Well done, Ghost.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.040
Everything went perfectly.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.711
Honey, are you all right?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.588
Where are we?

13:17.671 --> 13:18.756
You're conscious?

13:18.839 --> 13:21.300
This is Black Rock in Romania.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.635
Romania?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.723
Damn, that was a total success.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.892
But that was a close call.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.936
Who'd have thought
Praetorian was still there?

13:32.019 --> 13:36.273
Yeah. And I never would have guessed
the magic word would be written here.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.651
Seriously, guys. You'd better thank me.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.736
Playing zombie apocalypse was fun too.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.155
I wish I'd filmed that.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.908
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.371
The Count will be arriving soon,
so make yourselves comfortable here.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.541
Whoa! Liquor! How considerate.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.627
Let's start by drinking
a toast to ourselves.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.715
Here you are.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.841
Thank you.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.678
With that,

14:05.761 --> 14:10.307
Count Orlok can make his comeback
as the greatest supervillain ever.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.726
And the Network will be through.

14:13.310 --> 14:17.147
When that happens, the Count would like

14:17.231 --> 14:20.192
to make all of you members
of the new Syndicate.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.777
Syndicate?

14:21.860 --> 14:22.861
That's right.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.198
This place was our hideout back then.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.909
The supervillain Syndicate, right?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.495
You always told me about it
when we worked together.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.039
It was 30 years ago.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.165
Really?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.834
That's before the Network.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.461
It's just old folklore.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.631
Say, I'd like to take a shower. Can I?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.799
This way, please.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.720
Come on, tell us, The Heat.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.814
The mysterious Syndicate.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.401
The central members were

15:03.652 --> 15:05.446
the up-and-coming

15:06.614 --> 15:09.909
and energetic me, The Heat,

15:09.992 --> 15:13.495
and the lord of this castle,
Count Orlok, as well as

15:13.996 --> 15:15.414
one more.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.711
The Bastard.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.673
At that time,

15:24.757 --> 15:30.012
when the proliferating superheroes in
the US established The Union of Justice,

15:30.095 --> 15:34.516
we decided to get away from them
by branching into Europe.

15:37.019 --> 15:41.148
When we first formed the Syndicate,
our teamwork was superb.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.029
But while
the carefree Count Orlok loved surprises,

15:47.112 --> 15:51.784
Matts was always quiet and you could
never tell what he was thinking.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.370
-Oh, stop!
-They just didn't get along.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
So this is our HQ.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.586
Surprise!

16:02.670 --> 16:03.504
What?

16:05.089 --> 16:09.426
I hate being surprised by people
more than anything else.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.511
Remember that.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.429
Don't get mad.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.891
This is the dawn of our era!

16:16.684 --> 16:18.769
The Syndicate?

16:20.479 --> 16:25.985
Unlike superheroes, an organization
of villains can't possibly go well.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.697
We were always fighting
amongst ourselves, backstabbing,

16:29.780 --> 16:34.868
and trying to best one another.
That's just what villains do.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.788
When the Syndicate collapsed

16:37.871 --> 16:40.541
and The Bastard broke off from us,

16:40.624 --> 16:44.420
that's when the Network was formed.

16:47.089 --> 16:51.385
And this old castle was used as
a warehouse, a live music venue,

16:51.468 --> 16:55.889
and a rental studio for movies.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.645
It's been 30 years since then.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.314
But just for tonight,

17:04.398 --> 17:08.027
this is again the headquarters
for the Syndicate of us villains.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.279
The Heat is back!

17:12.239 --> 17:15.325
Yes, today truly is a special day.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.213
She's got a nice body.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.513
Honey! You're a breathtaking beauty.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.766
Aren't you guys exhausted?

17:39.266 --> 17:40.726
I'm starving.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.019
When's the pizza coming?

17:42.102 --> 17:43.729
I am very sorry.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.147
It should be here soon.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.649
That Orlok is late as well.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.279
-It's the pizza!
-All right! Here we go!

17:52.988 --> 17:54.281
Roddy!

18:03.082 --> 18:04.333
Too bad.

18:04.833 --> 18:09.254
Right now my power
stops you from moving. Mega Freeze.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
Your thoughts are frozen as well,

18:11.924 --> 18:15.844
so you can't speak,
and naturally, you can't use your powers.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.890
This way, you can't use
that crazy power of yours either.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.770
Come in, boss.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.947
How are you doing, everyone?

18:37.032 --> 18:40.828
The Heat, it's been a while.

18:40.911 --> 18:45.082
I can't believe you chose
this musty place for a hideout.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.043
What's that?

18:48.585 --> 18:52.381
Your look seems to say,
"Why is a superhero here?"

18:52.881 --> 18:57.427
You see, though I'm a member
of The Union of Justice,

18:57.511 --> 19:00.097
I'm a member of the Network
at the same time.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.141
I bet that surprises you,

19:02.224 --> 19:04.852
but this surprised me too.

19:04.935 --> 19:10.482
I never thought The Heat would
team up with Count Orlok again.

19:11.108 --> 19:15.487
People, your misconduct
needs to be rectified.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.614
You understand, don't you?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.616
My eyesight really is failing.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.871
Remember how you shouted "Black Rock"
when you disappeared?

19:23.954 --> 19:26.582
We're lucky we knew where that was.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.545
I also didn't know this chintzy helmet
had that kind of power.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.798
It was Count Orlok's secret weapon.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.969
Its power is truly to be reckoned with.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.597
Even if I am just about to retire…

19:41.680 --> 19:47.436
In fact, exactly because I am about to,
I must protect my Network.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.687
In other words…

19:48.770 --> 19:53.775
We can't ignore people who pull off jobs
without telling the Network.

19:54.359 --> 19:58.071
Normally, you have to pay 30% of the haul.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.992
But now that we've discovered
that you were hiding it from us,

20:02.075 --> 20:03.827
it'll cost even more.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.207
We'll take the whole
five million dollars that you made.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.543
It will all go to my retirement fund.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.547
And I'm not through!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.133
That was just the start.

20:19.092 --> 20:25.265
Traitors must be fined
a little more than that in blood.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.768
Ordinarily,

20:27.851 --> 20:32.773
I would go to painstaking lengths
to make life miserable for you

20:32.856 --> 20:39.238
by killing every last family member,
friend, and lover of yours.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.367
But since I'm about to retire…

20:46.745 --> 20:48.288
I'm not in the mood for that.

20:49.164 --> 20:54.127
After I retire, I plan on spending my time
painting pictures on an island in Japan.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.422
But there was one thing bothering me.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.175
This.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.470
The Bastard will retire,

21:03.553 --> 21:05.847
but The Salamander
will take over the Network.

21:06.556 --> 21:11.770
If someone like Count Orlok
got his helmet back and got carried away,

21:11.853 --> 21:14.147
it would interfere with our business.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.109
That's why I'm here.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.085
Excuse me! Pizza delivery!

21:35.794 --> 21:36.795
What?

21:36.878 --> 21:38.714
I got lost.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.885
Allow me to continue--

21:43.969 --> 21:46.013
Surprise!

21:46.096 --> 21:49.433
While I was hiding
in the attic waiting for you,

21:49.516 --> 21:51.727
I fell asleep.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.146
What?

21:54.229 --> 21:57.733
Why are you all standing still?
What kind of game is this?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.610
Oh, that's right!

22:02.779 --> 22:05.782
Here. The money I promised you.

22:05.866 --> 22:10.203
Come to think of it, where's my helmet
that was sitting right here?

22:16.209 --> 22:18.045
I thought I told you

22:18.128 --> 22:22.924
I hate being surprised by people
more than anything else.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.844
What are you doing here?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.023
Want some?

22:41.234 --> 22:44.362
Well now, I doubt we'll be meeting again.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.000
Oh, that's right.

22:58.293 --> 23:01.213
If you say a single word
about what happened here,

23:01.296 --> 23:03.381
I swear you're dead meat.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.385
You're lucky that The Bastard
was in a good mood.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.641
So long!

24:40.395 --> 24:45.400
