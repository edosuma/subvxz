WEBVTT

00:02.061 --> 00:06.005
(upbeat rock music playing)

00:09.068 --> 00:11.343
(bell rings)

00:11.420 --> 00:13.737
Well, that call definitely
robbed me of my appetite.

00:13.756 --> 00:16.831
Yeah, who'd have thought that
hipsters and hatchets and beer

00:16.851 --> 00:17.832
would be a bad idea?

00:17.926 --> 00:19.076
Hey, don't knock it.

00:19.094 --> 00:20.410
Axe throwing
is the new hot thing.

00:20.429 --> 00:22.246
Yeah, maybe not
so hot after today.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.023
It's a pretty cool
idea for a date,

00:24.174 --> 00:26.266
if somebody wanted
to step up his game.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.268
There will be no stepping up
of any game

00:28.345 --> 00:29.695
because my game is just fine.

00:29.772 --> 00:32.180
Bland chicken dinner
is not game.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.681
Girls wanna be surprised.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.350
What are y'all squabbling about?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.369
Nothing.
It's not firehouse talk.

00:37.521 --> 00:39.187
Fine. We'll wait
until we're home

00:39.281 --> 00:40.855
to discuss
your hot date tomorrow.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.023
Hey!

00:42.101 --> 00:43.784
Okay, now it's firehouse talk.

00:43.936 --> 00:45.269
Who's the lucky lady, Cap?

00:45.271 --> 00:47.695
Nobody. And my chicken
is not bland.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.381
Come on, Cap, we want the deets.

00:49.533 --> 00:51.199
-OWEN: No deets.
-PAUL: How about a name?

00:51.277 --> 00:53.126
-She doesn't have one.
-MATEO: It's Catherine.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.445
Oh, Catherine,
the cocktail waitress?

00:55.447 --> 00:57.705
Nah, the political powerhouse
who works for the governor.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.891
You know, the one he kidnapped.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.118
Oh, yeah!
Kidnapped Catherine.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.044
The one you met
on my dating app?

01:03.122 --> 01:04.971
Yes.
And I didn't kidnap her.

01:05.124 --> 01:06.565
I borrowed a car
to save a child.

01:06.642 --> 01:08.975
She was only held
against her will very briefly.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.310
And they say
romance is dead.

01:10.462 --> 01:12.646
No, it won't be,
if somebody surprises her

01:12.798 --> 01:14.131
with something special tomorrow.

01:14.149 --> 01:15.982
Okay, Catherine, like me,

01:16.059 --> 01:17.859
is a type-A
master of the universe.

01:17.894 --> 01:20.637
We're organized,
value time management.

01:20.656 --> 01:21.747
And you know what we hate?

01:23.325 --> 01:25.233
-Bland chicken?
-(all laughing)

01:25.327 --> 01:26.993
Surprises.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.403
The answer is surprises.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.737
-FIREFIGHTER: Captain Strand?
-Yeah.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.422
You got a delivery.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.073
Is it my vegetable spiralizer?

01:32.093 --> 01:34.593
No, it's, uh, it's not that.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.554
I want to know.

01:41.493 --> 01:44.085
-Oh, God, no.
-Whoa-ho! No way!

01:44.163 --> 01:45.178
PAUL:
You got a parrot, Cap?

01:45.331 --> 01:46.847
MATEO:
I'm pretty sure it's a toucan.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.107
It's a... it's a macaw.

01:48.183 --> 01:50.016
Did anything come with this?

01:50.018 --> 01:51.926
-Yes, this letter.
-(squawking)

01:51.946 --> 01:53.094
OWEN: She wouldn't.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.671
-Who?
-She?

01:54.673 --> 01:55.781
Gwyn.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.116
This is a letter.

01:57.192 --> 01:59.509
From her lawyer.

01:59.528 --> 02:01.453
She left me
this bird in her will.

02:01.605 --> 02:03.363
Hello, butt face.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.456
-Ooh.
-Oh!

02:04.533 --> 02:08.352
(theme music plays)

02:08.370 --> 02:11.446
NORAH: Oh, my God, babe,
we are gonna be so late.

02:11.523 --> 02:13.523
I bet the service
already started.

02:13.525 --> 02:14.616
<i> Just breathe, Norah.</i>

02:14.635 --> 02:16.802
<i> They're not gonna</i>
<i> start without you.</i>

02:16.953 --> 02:18.712
I was so on time too.

02:18.864 --> 02:22.457
And then Liana spat up avocado
all over her christening gown.

02:22.534 --> 02:25.144
<i> Norah, don't sweat it.</i>
<i> You're gonna be fine.</i>

02:25.295 --> 02:27.371
I just hate you missing
all her milestones.

02:27.373 --> 02:28.313
<i> Me too.</i>

02:28.390 --> 02:29.130
LIANA: Mom?

02:29.208 --> 02:31.817
Say hi to daddy, Liana.

02:31.968 --> 02:33.059
<i> Hi, baby.</i>

02:33.212 --> 02:34.153
<i> Daddy loves you.</i>

02:34.304 --> 02:35.970
(babbles)
I love you too.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.230
(Norah laughs)

02:37.383 --> 02:39.658
She is so beautiful, Javi.

02:39.851 --> 02:41.385
I can't wait for you
to meet her.

02:41.478 --> 02:42.644
<i> Oh, me too.</i>

02:42.663 --> 02:43.811
<i> But I'll meet her soon.</i>

02:44.072 --> 02:48.333
Soon? You mean in six months
after your deployment?

02:49.061 --> 02:50.460
<i> Closer to about...</i>

02:51.063 --> 02:52.588
<i> 60 seconds.</i>

02:53.899 --> 02:55.716
What? What...

02:56.568 --> 02:57.342
Is that...

02:57.494 --> 02:59.469
That's St. Luke's
behind you.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.238
JAVIER: Huh.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.740
I guess it is.
(laughing)

03:03.833 --> 03:05.592
Javier, are you serious? How?

03:05.669 --> 03:08.762
<i> How about 29 hours</i>
<i> in the jump seat of a C-5.</i>

03:08.838 --> 03:11.339
I can't believe it.
Did you hear that, Liana?

03:11.433 --> 03:13.767
Daddy's here.
You're gonna meet Daddy.

03:13.843 --> 03:16.177
<i> I made it home in one piece</i>
<i> just like I promised.</i>

03:16.197 --> 03:18.488
-(horn blaring)
-(tires screeching)

03:19.516 --> 03:20.532
(screams)

03:27.282 --> 03:29.190
He's stuck under my car!

03:29.268 --> 03:31.001
-(siren wailing)
-(horn honking)

03:37.276 --> 03:38.458
(groans) Please hurry.
He's over here.

03:38.535 --> 03:40.052
-TK, assess the husband.
-TK: Yeah, Cap.

03:40.128 --> 03:41.053
TOMMY: I'm gonna
take a good look at you

03:41.129 --> 03:42.554
and your baby, okay?
Come on.

03:45.784 --> 03:46.800
Can you tell me your name?

03:46.876 --> 03:48.969
(groans)
Staff Sergeant Javier Galvez.

03:49.045 --> 03:50.454
How's your pain, Sergeant?

03:50.472 --> 03:52.622
JAVIER: It hurts, if that's
what you mean. (groaning)

03:52.624 --> 03:53.974
TK: Where are you
feeling the pain?

03:54.126 --> 03:55.067
Hands and feet or neck or head?

03:55.218 --> 03:56.551
Mostly my leg.

03:56.628 --> 03:59.479
That's not motor oil
I feel, is it?

03:59.631 --> 04:01.990
All I wanted to do
was meet my daughter.

04:03.485 --> 04:05.410
Alright, Judd,
get the bags and the cribbing.

04:05.562 --> 04:06.653
Marjan, the jaws.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.229
Alright, everybody,
we need to move back.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.540
Give us a little room to work.

04:11.827 --> 04:14.503
(tense music playing)

04:19.242 --> 04:21.075
He made it through three tours
without a scratch

04:21.095 --> 04:22.427
and then I run him over?

04:22.579 --> 04:24.096
Hey, I need you to take
some deep breaths, okay?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.514
TK: Hey, Cap.

04:27.326 --> 04:28.416
What are we looking
at under there?

04:28.510 --> 04:29.509
It's hard to tell exactly,

04:29.661 --> 04:31.252
but he's bleeding out
above the knee.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.604
He's probably lost
a liter of blood.

04:32.756 --> 04:34.439
Could be the popliteal artery.

04:34.625 --> 04:35.832
Can you tourniquet?

04:35.851 --> 04:37.183
Not with the way
he's stuck under there.

04:37.336 --> 04:38.852
Captain Strand, you're up.

04:38.928 --> 04:39.927
Roger that.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.113
Paul, Mateo, start the cribbing.

04:41.264 --> 04:42.597
Judd, chock these wheels.

04:42.658 --> 04:46.176
Marjan, fire up the jaws,
set the stabilizer plate.

04:46.178 --> 04:48.120
Let's get this car
off the ground.

04:49.848 --> 04:51.623
(groaning)

04:52.960 --> 04:54.184
-TK: Okay, set?
-MARJAN: Yeah.

04:54.202 --> 04:55.294
Alright, Cap,
we're ready for it.

04:55.445 --> 04:57.504
-Do it.
-(whirring)

05:00.134 --> 05:02.192
-(screaming)
-Hey! Stop! Stop!

05:02.194 --> 05:03.877
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

05:04.029 --> 05:05.378
(screaming continues)

05:05.455 --> 05:08.307
His leg's jammed between
the frame and transmission.

05:08.383 --> 05:09.549
We lift the car, we left him.

05:09.626 --> 05:11.125
Alright, we've gotta
get his leg free.

05:11.203 --> 05:12.293
Alright, so what are you
thinking, Cap,

05:12.313 --> 05:13.703
disassemble the engine,
do it that way?

05:13.705 --> 05:16.389
That would take a Dale Earnhardt
pit crew 20 minutes.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.633
His BP's dropping, Cap,
it's 79 over 45.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.653
Alright, we can't lift the car,
we can't disassemble it.

05:22.064 --> 05:22.988
Captain?

05:23.215 --> 05:24.564
Field amputation?

05:24.641 --> 05:26.049
Good chance
he'll bleed out first.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.809
So how about
an old-fashioned lube job?

05:27.886 --> 05:30.329
Captain, you mind if we borrow
a couple 30-mil syringes?

05:30.480 --> 05:32.238
And a lot of
water-based lubricant.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.749
-Got it?
-On it, Cap.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.173
Alright.

05:41.249 --> 05:43.400
-How you doing, Sergeant?
-(weakly): I'm cold.

05:43.402 --> 05:44.734
You just hang in there, Sarge,

05:44.736 --> 05:46.386
we're gonna get you
out of here in no time.

05:47.497 --> 05:49.239
Alright, Cap,
he's about as lubed up

05:49.257 --> 05:50.182
as we're gonna get him.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.908
Alright, Marjan,
nice and easy.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.061
(whirring)

06:03.088 --> 06:04.178
MATEO: Hey, he's fading.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.031
Alright, let's get him
out of there!

06:08.369 --> 06:10.485
-(rumbling)
-JUDD: Whoa!

06:11.688 --> 06:14.998
-Hey, his leg's free.
-Come on, let's move!

06:17.269 --> 06:19.503
TK: Easy, easy.

06:22.774 --> 06:24.424
One, two, three.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.035
I got the tourniquet.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.036
(Liana cooing)

06:29.038 --> 06:31.264
(flatline)

06:32.300 --> 06:34.784
-Lost pulse, Cap.
-He's crashing.

06:34.786 --> 06:36.395
TK, bolus fluids.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.380
Pushing epi.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.441
-Start compressions.
-TK: On it.

06:44.053 --> 06:46.113
(flatline continues)

06:48.242 --> 06:50.659
(radio chatter echoing)

06:57.142 --> 06:58.658
Oh, God. Oh, God, Javi!
Please, please!

06:58.810 --> 07:01.420
Ma'am, it's better
that you stay back.

07:01.496 --> 07:03.255
NORAH:
She never got the chance
to meet him.

07:03.406 --> 07:05.465
At least let her say goodbye.

07:14.159 --> 07:16.843
-NORAH (crying): Javi.
-(Liana crying)

07:16.845 --> 07:18.645
I'm so sorry.

07:22.668 --> 07:25.026
-We love you so much.
-(church bells ringing)

07:26.021 --> 07:27.696
This is Liana.

07:31.343 --> 07:34.035
(Liana babbles, cries)

07:35.847 --> 07:38.081
(beeping)

07:39.201 --> 07:40.667
He's coming back to sinus.

07:41.853 --> 07:43.128
NORAH: Javi?

07:44.189 --> 07:45.964
(Liana crying)

07:46.041 --> 07:47.073
Is that her?

07:47.150 --> 07:48.950
NORAH: Yeah.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.117
Yeah, this is her.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.637
This is her, Javi.
This is our baby.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.057
JAVIER: Wow.

07:56.885 --> 07:58.351
She is beautiful.

08:02.131 --> 08:04.065
(truck beeping)

08:07.512 --> 08:09.321
Hey, Paul.
Can macaws eat cereal?

08:09.397 --> 08:11.323
Captain said
that one eats fingers.

08:11.399 --> 08:12.732
I was thinking
of lowering some in

08:12.884 --> 08:15.142
like they did with the goat
in "Jurassic Park."

08:15.162 --> 08:17.220
Hey, Judd, straighten out.

08:17.239 --> 08:19.055
That was a cow, not a goat.

08:19.057 --> 08:20.332
MATEO:
No, I remember a goat.

08:20.408 --> 08:21.725
It was definitely a cow.

08:21.727 --> 08:24.244
It moos the whole way down.
It's awful.

08:24.396 --> 08:26.746
Paul, would you
tell Marjan she's wrong?

08:26.898 --> 08:28.173
It was both.

08:28.324 --> 08:29.841
The Raptors got the cow,

08:29.918 --> 08:31.593
the T-Rex got the goat.

08:33.496 --> 08:34.846
PAUL: Judd, stop!

08:34.848 --> 08:36.348
Stop! Judd!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.758
-Right.
-Okay.

08:38.835 --> 08:40.602
PAUL: No! No! No!

08:41.504 --> 08:42.687
(groans, screams)

08:42.764 --> 08:44.380
(panting)

08:44.382 --> 08:46.007
-MARJAN: Hey. Hey.
-PAUL: No. No.

08:46.084 --> 08:47.359
-No. No.
-MARJAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:47.435 --> 08:49.510
-MARJAN: Hey, hey, hey.
-PAUL: God.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.029
MARJAN: Hey. Breathe.

08:51.773 --> 08:53.031
Breathe.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.849
Oh!

08:54.943 --> 08:56.109
(exhales)

08:56.185 --> 08:58.185
Will you please let me
get Captain Vega

08:58.263 --> 08:59.262
to take a look at you?

08:59.264 --> 09:00.956
No, no, no, I'm good.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.374
I'm good.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.543
MARJAN: The nightmares
just keep coming, huh?

09:05.379 --> 09:06.936
What is that, five this week?

09:06.955 --> 09:08.547
Yeah, something like that.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.549
MARJAN: And they seem
to be getting worse.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.275
Do you wanna talk about it?

09:12.277 --> 09:15.387
No. Look, it's nothing
to talk about, okay?

09:15.463 --> 09:17.097
It's probably something I ate.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.132
It's just dreams, Marjan.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.967
MARJAN: Dreams that
have you hyperventilating

09:21.044 --> 09:23.061
and waking up drenched in sweat.

09:24.122 --> 09:25.305
-Look, I'm-I'm fine.
-Hey.

09:25.457 --> 09:27.691
(Paul inhales
and exhales deeply)

09:28.735 --> 09:30.026
I'm alright.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.362
(exhales)

09:33.448 --> 09:34.698
-Dude.
-What?

09:36.818 --> 09:38.118
Your heartbeat.

09:39.154 --> 09:41.079
It's all over the place.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.587
GLORIA (over laptop):
<i> Owen Strand,</i>
<i> it's been too long.</i>

09:48.738 --> 09:51.164
-I'm already being billed,
aren't I?
-(bird squawks)

09:51.316 --> 09:53.483
<i> I wish we weren't</i>
<i> renewing our acquaintance</i>

09:53.501 --> 09:55.485
<i> under such</i>
<i> tragic circumstances.</i>

09:55.503 --> 09:59.005
Yes, because
the divorce proceedings
were such a joy.

09:59.157 --> 10:00.990
<i> Water under the bridge.</i>

10:00.992 --> 10:02.492
<i> We aren't enemies anymore.</i>

10:02.494 --> 10:06.754
Did you facilitate the delivery
of a macaw to my firehouse?

10:06.832 --> 10:07.497
<i> I did.</i>

10:07.515 --> 10:08.514
Then we remain enemies.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.516
MACAW:
Sleep on the couch, butt face.

10:10.669 --> 10:13.778
OWEN: You hear this?
This animal
is abusive and hateful,

10:14.005 --> 10:15.113
not to mention a biter.

10:15.264 --> 10:17.115
There's no way that
you can make me keep it.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.617
<i> Mr. Strand,</i>
<i> as Gwyn's lawyer,</i>

10:18.693 --> 10:22.028
<i> I am simply executing</i>
<i> her care plan for Ginsburg,</i>

10:22.105 --> 10:25.874
<i> as stipulated by her will</i>
<i> and letter of final wishes.</i>

10:27.294 --> 10:30.795
There is no way that Gwyn would
make me keep this animal.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.279
There has to be a mistake.

10:32.357 --> 10:33.857
<i> "If my</i>
<i> Harlequin Macaw Ginsburg</i>

10:33.875 --> 10:35.041
<i> "is alive at my death,</i>

10:35.193 --> 10:37.210
<i> I leave him in the care</i>
<i> of Owen Strand."</i>

10:37.362 --> 10:38.970
<i> -Are you Owen Strand?</i>
-Yes.

10:39.122 --> 10:40.363
<i> Then he belongs to you.</i>

10:40.382 --> 10:42.140
Sounds like
Mom wanted this, Dad.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.200
OWEN: Maybe 20 years ago,

10:44.202 --> 10:45.459
when we were making our wills.

10:45.537 --> 10:48.037
Things were very different
between us then,

10:48.131 --> 10:49.463
mostly because we were married.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.298
<i> Actually, her will was updated</i>

10:51.318 --> 10:53.393
<i> one month after</i>
<i> the birth of the baby.</i>

10:53.545 --> 10:55.469
Which baby?
The baby that's a baby

10:55.489 --> 10:57.213
or the baby
that's now a grown man

10:57.232 --> 10:58.990
and smirking at me?

10:59.067 --> 11:00.400
<i> Baby Jonah.</i>

11:00.552 --> 11:02.385
He's really not
that terrible, Dad.

11:02.387 --> 11:04.145
Why don't you take him home?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.997
I'm just gonna... go.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.557
(squawks)

11:07.559 --> 11:09.668
Alright, Gloria, are you sure
you don't want the bird?

11:09.819 --> 11:12.170
Because I think the two of you
would really get each other.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.246
You're both high maintenance

11:13.340 --> 11:15.840
and you spread misery
wherever you go.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.900
<i> Sorry, Owen.</i>

11:16.918 --> 11:18.343
<i> You're the only one</i>

11:18.420 --> 11:20.753
<i> Gwyn intended</i>
<i> to give the bird to.</i>

11:20.906 --> 11:22.180
Yeah, well...

11:22.331 --> 11:24.590
she really did give me the bird.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.517
(caws)

11:28.263 --> 11:30.355
TOMMY:
Hey, how's it going up there?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.265
I, I think I heard squawking.

11:32.341 --> 11:33.525
That was just Dad.

11:33.676 --> 11:36.010
He's really trying
to get rid of that bird, huh?

11:36.029 --> 11:40.273
Yeah. Mom was kind of undefeated
when it came to legal matters,

11:40.425 --> 11:43.851
and looks like
her streak's gonna continue.

11:43.929 --> 11:46.187
Are you headed
somewhere special right now?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.206
No, just-just home. Why?

11:48.283 --> 11:50.116
You mind sittin' for a minute?

11:50.268 --> 11:52.627
Okay.
(clears throat)

11:55.239 --> 11:56.214
Listen, I... (sighs)

11:56.365 --> 11:58.532
I'm really not good
at this stuff.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.442
Sitting?

11:59.461 --> 12:03.037
Discussing uncomfortable things.

12:03.131 --> 12:04.764
It's okay, Cap, I...

12:05.708 --> 12:07.142
I know what this is about.

12:07.786 --> 12:08.952
You do?

12:08.970 --> 12:10.228
The narcotics safe.

12:10.305 --> 12:12.397
I opened it last week
without logging it

12:12.474 --> 12:14.640
and, uh, whichever way
you wanna reprimand me,

12:14.793 --> 12:15.883
I... I understand, alright?

12:16.219 --> 12:19.053
But you have my word
it will not
happen again, Cap.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.147
I know it won't, TK.

12:21.224 --> 12:23.408
And I appreciate your honesty.

12:23.635 --> 12:26.119
But that is not why
I wanted to talk to you.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.170
What's... What's up?

12:28.172 --> 12:31.082
We've hardly spoken
since your mom passed.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.085
I want to know
how you're holding up.

12:34.237 --> 12:36.045
Well, she's, uh...

12:37.832 --> 12:39.007
She's dead.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.409
What other option do I have

12:42.429 --> 12:46.097
than just
getting through it, right?

12:46.249 --> 12:48.457
Yeah. Okay.
So, so, here we go.

12:48.459 --> 12:53.087
And if-if this is weird
or we cross some...

12:53.164 --> 12:55.256
work-life boundary,

12:55.333 --> 12:57.025
do not hesitate to say no.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.029
But there's a meeting
I go to sometimes.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.357
It's for people
who have lost someone.

13:04.433 --> 13:08.177
Yeah, I might...
I know the thought
of pouring your guts out

13:08.196 --> 13:11.706
to a bunch of strangers
sounds excruciating.

13:12.775 --> 13:15.018
You know what?
I-I definitely see

13:15.020 --> 13:16.536
that I have overstepped, so...

13:16.688 --> 13:19.756
Cap, I would love
to go to a meeting with you.

13:21.359 --> 13:22.509
Okay.

13:23.286 --> 13:24.385
Okay.

13:27.032 --> 13:28.047
(door opens)

13:28.199 --> 13:30.291
DR. NELSON:
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

13:30.368 --> 13:32.811
I wanted to run
some of your test results

13:32.962 --> 13:34.687
by my chief of cardiology.

13:38.301 --> 13:40.209
Okay, well, that sounds ominous.

13:40.228 --> 13:45.490
Mr. Strickland,
you have a serious arrhythmia.

13:46.551 --> 13:47.733
How serious are we talking?

13:47.886 --> 13:49.494
DR. NELSON:
Frankly, given
the demands of your job,

13:49.571 --> 13:53.906
I'm surprised you haven't had
a cardiac event already.

13:54.025 --> 13:55.834
But I feel like a million bucks.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.335
That's not entirely true.

13:57.412 --> 13:59.320
He's had a few dizzy spells

13:59.339 --> 14:03.508
and shortness of breath
at night sometimes.

14:03.659 --> 14:06.235
Yeah, but it's been so mild,
I didn't think to bring it up.

14:06.296 --> 14:07.661
DR. NELSON:
Do you recall when
you first started

14:07.739 --> 14:09.681
experiencing these symptoms?

14:09.832 --> 14:11.407
Few months ago, I guess.

14:11.426 --> 14:13.409
He was in that gym collapse
in the blizzard

14:13.411 --> 14:14.927
and he got hypothermia.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.429
DR. NELSON:
I see that in your chart,
and that makes sense.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.189
Does anybody
in your family have

14:18.266 --> 14:20.692
a history of cardiac trouble?

14:22.511 --> 14:25.613
My dad, uh, he
died of a heart attack.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.533
May I ask how old he was?

14:29.427 --> 14:30.451
Thirty-six.

14:31.112 --> 14:32.612
I didn't know that.

14:32.764 --> 14:34.855
Yeah, but it was
the Chicago comfort food
that got him,

14:34.933 --> 14:37.600
you know, too much
deep dish and ugly dogs.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.711
I eat clean.
I work out six days a week.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.120
I'm telling you, I'm good.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.881
Mr. Strickland, um...

14:43.032 --> 14:43.956
Can I ask you a question?

14:44.109 --> 14:46.217
It may seem strange.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.461
Have you been having nightmares?

14:48.537 --> 14:51.797
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, he has
as a matter of fact, why?

14:51.892 --> 14:56.210
I believe you have something
called Brugada syndrome.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.956
It's a very rare
heart condition,

14:59.974 --> 15:01.290
it's quite serious.

15:01.476 --> 15:07.071
Um, arrhythmia and nightmares
are the telltale symptoms.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.941
Okay, so, so,
what is he looking at?

15:10.093 --> 15:12.911
Untreated, it can be fatal,

15:12.987 --> 15:16.305
but the good news is

15:16.324 --> 15:18.474
there are simple,
proven remedies

15:18.476 --> 15:22.903
that can minimize
the mortality risk

15:22.923 --> 15:25.164
to almost nil.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.967
(sighs deeply)
That is good news.

15:28.987 --> 15:30.486
What-what kinda remedies?

15:30.505 --> 15:32.505
I'd like to implant
a defibrillator.

15:32.581 --> 15:33.431
What, a pacemaker?

15:33.508 --> 15:36.008
It's more...
sophisticated than that.

15:36.161 --> 15:39.162
But, yeah,
in layman's terms, yes.

15:39.164 --> 15:40.939
I... I'm 38 years old, man.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.106
I can't have a pacemaker.

15:42.183 --> 15:43.942
You know what that
would do to my fitness?

15:44.018 --> 15:45.184
They'd put me on limited duty

15:45.261 --> 15:46.669
or, or force me
to early retirement.

15:46.762 --> 15:49.430
Okay, you can, you can train
your body back to full strength

15:49.449 --> 15:52.008
even with a pacemaker,
right, Doc?

15:52.026 --> 15:54.702
Um... it's technically possible.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.455
But it's not likely.

15:57.606 --> 15:58.623
DR. NELSON: I'll be blunt.

15:58.850 --> 16:01.417
Mr. Strickland,
without this procedure...

16:02.629 --> 16:04.712
I don't see you making it to 40.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.687
So you wanna order takeout?

16:21.464 --> 16:22.463
Whatever.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.391
What are you feeling,
ramen, Thai?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.568
I-I don't care,
I'm not really hungry.

16:29.230 --> 16:33.307
Look... I know this sucks, okay?

16:33.401 --> 16:36.052
But you're not gonna
go through this alone.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.720
Tomorrow, we walk
into Cap's office

16:37.722 --> 16:40.832
and tell him together,
and then I will be by your side

16:40.983 --> 16:42.500
every step of the way.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.628
I'm not doing
the surgery, Marjan.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.323
MARJAN: What do you mean?

16:49.342 --> 16:52.251
You heard what the doctor said
happens if you don't.

16:52.328 --> 16:54.178
Yeah, and I heard
what happens if I do.

16:54.288 --> 16:57.740
-You don't know that.
-Yeah, I do.

16:57.759 --> 17:00.667
Okay, so even if you don't,
your life's not over

17:00.745 --> 17:03.579
just because you can't run
into burning buildings anymore.

17:03.598 --> 17:06.190
Well, either way,
I don't intend to find out.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.417
MARJAN: So that's your plan?

17:08.419 --> 17:11.437
Just keep going to work
and pretend like
nothing's happening?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.756
What if you have to run a line
up 20 flights of stairs

17:13.775 --> 17:16.701
or lift a car off a motorist
and you go into cardiac arrest?

17:16.778 --> 17:19.762
Marjan, I've been
doing that for 18 years.
So far, so good.

17:19.764 --> 17:22.457
Damn it, Paul,
you're gonna end up
just like your dad!

17:24.619 --> 17:26.602
Which would be an honor.

17:26.621 --> 17:29.363
My dad was the greatest man
I ever knew.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.108
He taught me to live my life
with passion,

17:32.126 --> 17:35.278
with purpose, without shame.

17:35.296 --> 17:38.056
To be exactly who I am,
no matter what anybody says.

17:38.132 --> 17:40.349
And this is who I am.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.478
I just don't want you to die.

17:45.957 --> 17:47.398
I don't want that either.

17:48.459 --> 17:50.551
But I would rather
die a firefighter

17:50.570 --> 17:52.570
than live any other way.

17:58.653 --> 18:01.895
(calm meditation music playing)

18:01.973 --> 18:04.231
WOMAN (over speakers):
<i> Ground yourself</i>
<i> to the universe</i>

18:04.309 --> 18:06.900
<i> with a long, deep inhale.</i>

18:06.920 --> 18:08.327
(inhales deeply)

18:08.479 --> 18:10.996
<i> Allow yourself to be</i>
<i> infused with tranquility</i>

18:11.149 --> 18:13.499
<i> as you exhale</i>
<i> through the nose.</i>

18:13.576 --> 18:18.096
<i> Unburden yourself</i>
<i> of the toxicity</i>
<i> of the mundane.</i>

18:18.172 --> 18:19.555
(bird squawks)

18:23.678 --> 18:25.177
(bird chirping)

18:25.330 --> 18:26.920
GINSBURG:
Outta the road, jackass!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.013
(squawks)

18:28.166 --> 18:31.150
Get over it.
(squawking)

18:32.928 --> 18:33.927
Get out of my house.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.354
Ginsburg, shut up!

18:35.506 --> 18:37.448
(loud squawking)

18:37.525 --> 18:38.858
(inhales deeply)

18:39.010 --> 18:40.434
(low squawking)

18:40.453 --> 18:42.328
GINSBURG:
Call me, sweetheart.

18:43.681 --> 18:45.848
Please, can't you be quiet?

18:45.850 --> 18:48.775
It's impossible to meditate
when it sounds like rush hour

18:48.837 --> 18:49.869
at 42nd Street.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.687
GINSBURG:
Get over it.

18:51.706 --> 18:54.357
Hey, do you want the cage cover?

18:54.359 --> 18:56.283
Because I will give you
the cage cover.

18:56.361 --> 18:59.286
-GINSBURG: Hey, butt face.
-Alright, that's it.

18:59.364 --> 19:01.322
MATEO: Hey, everything
okay in here, Cap?

19:01.324 --> 19:03.624
Actually, Mateo, it's not.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.385
Feathered spawn of Satan
has taken up residence
in my living room.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.462
GINSBURG:
Bitch and moan,
bitch and moan.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.724
If it makes you feel any better,
I've had worse roommates.

19:11.876 --> 19:12.708
I doubt that very much.

19:12.727 --> 19:14.710
My last ones blew up my house.

19:14.712 --> 19:15.711
OWEN: Fair enough.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.546
But at least
they weren't trying to heckle

19:17.548 --> 19:20.383
and taunt you for literally
the rest of your life.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.568
You know, these birds can live
to be over 100 years old.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.537
-No way.
-Yeah way.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.081
Winston Churchill's macaw...

19:27.892 --> 19:29.241
is still alive.

19:29.394 --> 19:30.168
Damn!

19:30.319 --> 19:31.485
I mean, can you imagine

19:31.562 --> 19:33.396
the history that bird
must have witnessed?

19:33.398 --> 19:34.897
Oh, I'm imagining
the next 40 years of my life

19:34.916 --> 19:36.323
with this beaked bastard.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.417
MATEO:
I mean, maybe if you're
gonna be stuck with him...

19:38.494 --> 19:40.236
maybe you should
make peace with him.

19:40.238 --> 19:41.846
Hmm, that's impossible.

19:41.997 --> 19:43.422
GINSBURG: Get over it.

19:43.499 --> 19:45.257
You see? Evil.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.593
Uh, maybe make him
an offering.

19:47.670 --> 19:50.688
An offering, you mean like a,
like a sacrifice to the demon?

19:50.765 --> 19:52.064
Or a peanut?

19:53.008 --> 19:53.933
Oh, what are you doing?

19:54.009 --> 19:55.175
I'm telling you,
the last person

19:55.195 --> 19:56.419
who put their hand in that cage

19:56.421 --> 19:59.422
got the tip of their pinkie
bitten off.

19:59.515 --> 20:00.773
It was one of
TK's stupid friends.

20:00.942 --> 20:03.451
-What-what are you doing?
-I'm showing him some trust.

20:05.446 --> 20:06.353
Here you go, boy.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.948
Here you go. Good boy.
Come on.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.041
GINSBURG: Love you, honey.

20:10.192 --> 20:11.934
(Mateo laughs) Oh!

20:12.027 --> 20:14.286
I love you too, Ginsey.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.287
Yeah.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.197
You said that
just like Gwyn used to.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.865
How-how are you doing this?

20:18.943 --> 20:19.942
He hates people.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.444
GINSBURG:
Shut up, butt face.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.888
Well, maybe
he doesn't hate people

20:24.039 --> 20:26.641
as much as he just hates you.

20:31.046 --> 20:33.064
Oh! (laughs)

20:33.215 --> 20:36.025
After you, dear. I'm sorry.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.736
Aw.

20:41.315 --> 20:42.365
Oh!

20:44.135 --> 20:45.910
Oh, what the hey.

20:46.061 --> 20:47.245
(chuckles)

20:47.396 --> 20:48.971
DAPHNE:
So now I don't know what to do.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.248
He used to love the chicken,

20:50.324 --> 20:52.399
but he has
a poultry allergy now.

20:52.477 --> 20:54.252
-ISAAC: That's too bad...
-Uh, ex... Excuse me.

20:54.403 --> 20:55.419
ISAAC:
Try something with salmon.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.813
The oil does
wonders for their coat,

20:57.832 --> 20:59.648
and it's quite yummy.

20:59.667 --> 21:00.716
Or so you hear.

21:01.986 --> 21:04.244
Uh... y-young man?

21:04.264 --> 21:07.156
Could I borrow
those big muscles of yours

21:07.158 --> 21:09.008
to lift some kitty litter?

21:09.160 --> 21:12.661
Uh, sure thing.
I'll be with you right after
I finish with this customer.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.665
Let's get you all set up.
Uh, I'm Isaac, by the way.

21:16.684 --> 21:19.092
-I picked up on that.
-Really? How?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.611
Name on your name tag
around your neck.

21:20.763 --> 21:22.521
-Aah. That.
-(both chuckle)

21:22.673 --> 21:23.506
DAPHNE: I'm Daphne.

21:23.691 --> 21:25.508
ISAAC: Well, Daphne,
you're in luck.

21:25.526 --> 21:27.693
I have something here
with fresh-caught fish

21:27.845 --> 21:29.120
and ancient grains.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.122
-Ooh!
-ISAAC: Top-shelf stuff.

21:31.273 --> 21:33.106
-DAPHNE: Oh. Literally.
-ISAAC: Literally.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.709
(dog whining)

21:35.795 --> 21:37.044
(toots)

21:37.797 --> 21:39.204
Young man, I'm waiting.

21:39.281 --> 21:41.373
Yes, ma'am, I told you
just one second.

21:41.526 --> 21:45.152
And I told you,
you gulp of hot horse piddle,

21:45.229 --> 21:47.029
I need that litter.

21:47.031 --> 21:48.789
Ma'am.
There's no need for that.

21:48.866 --> 21:50.049
She can go ahead of me,
it's fine.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.034
No, it's not fine.
You were here first.

21:52.053 --> 21:53.477
-She can wait her turn.
-(horn tooting)

21:53.629 --> 21:58.541
Quit wasting my time while
you're eye-humping this hussy.

21:58.543 --> 22:00.042
Okay, now I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

22:00.061 --> 22:01.968
Oh, you want me to leave?

22:02.046 --> 22:03.529
Ma'am. Ma'am!

22:04.065 --> 22:05.230
DAPHNE: Brisket!

22:58.119 --> 22:59.860
She said multiple casualties?

22:59.937 --> 23:01.120
Correct. Female, 30s.

23:01.196 --> 23:03.029
Trapped under
those shelving units.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.289
She's conscious and talking,

23:04.442 --> 23:06.199
but because of
the electrical issues,

23:06.219 --> 23:07.701
no one's been able to get close.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.945
Alright. Mateo, let's get
to the breaker box.

23:09.947 --> 23:11.113
Turn the power off.

23:11.132 --> 23:12.723
Paul, Marjan,
let's get some work lights

23:12.875 --> 23:13.966
and set up some airbags.

23:14.118 --> 23:15.467
The other casualties,
where are they?

23:15.620 --> 23:18.120
Store employee took a can
to the forehead in the attack.

23:18.122 --> 23:20.472
Attack?
Where's the suspect?

23:20.625 --> 23:23.308
That would be
our final patient there.

23:23.461 --> 23:24.735
(groans sharply)

23:24.812 --> 23:26.478
What, you're telling me
Mee-Maw did all this?

23:26.555 --> 23:29.815
Let me go,
you sons of bitches!

23:29.892 --> 23:31.242
(woman yells)

23:31.318 --> 23:33.577
Never underestimate a Mee-Maw
on a motorized cart.

23:33.729 --> 23:36.062
If you wouldn't mind
checking her out
so we can take her to jail.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.489
Captain Strand,
how long do you think

23:37.566 --> 23:39.232
to extricate the lady
under the shelves?

23:39.310 --> 23:40.325
Ten minutes more or less.

23:40.478 --> 23:41.977
Great. We'll take care
of these two.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.495
Radio when you need us.

23:43.648 --> 23:46.239
Alright, we have a plan.

23:46.317 --> 23:48.651
Let's get to work.

23:48.653 --> 23:51.003
Hey, Cap, I'm barely
getting a BP reading.

23:51.155 --> 23:53.413
Try manually.

23:53.491 --> 23:55.157
-TK, you need to hold her still.
-(woman groans)

23:55.159 --> 23:57.509
Yeah, I'm trying,
but she's very strong.

23:57.662 --> 23:58.844
ISAAC: Yeah, no kidding.

23:58.921 --> 24:00.086
She went Nolan Ryan on me

24:00.164 --> 24:01.346
with a can of cat food.

24:01.423 --> 24:04.424
You deserved it,
you hippie ass wipe.

24:04.502 --> 24:07.352
You know, I never believed
the crazy cat lady stereotype.

24:07.429 --> 24:08.428
Not until today.

24:08.506 --> 24:11.115
WOMAN:
Get your meat hooks off me!

24:11.192 --> 24:14.267
TK:
Uh, Cap, her cuff
is on correctly,

24:14.345 --> 24:16.454
but it's like her BP
is bottoming out. It's weird.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.956
She shouldn't be conscious
much less cursing people out.

24:19.107 --> 24:22.275
I have an idea as to why.
Okay. Ma'am?

24:22.295 --> 24:23.944
How many cats do you have?

24:23.963 --> 24:26.355
Sixteen little angels.

24:26.357 --> 24:29.133
And you two nitwits
are keeping me from 'em!

24:29.284 --> 24:31.135
Alright, listen to me.
Do you change your cat litter?

24:31.286 --> 24:33.212
Of course, I do!
They're my babies.

24:33.288 --> 24:34.788
TK, start a line right now.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.290
-This is toxoplasmosis.
-You think it's a parasite?

24:37.368 --> 24:39.201
It's often found in cat feces

24:39.294 --> 24:41.461
and linked
to sudden rage disorders

24:41.481 --> 24:45.149
and will mask symptoms like
extremely low blood pressure.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.693
Would you two stop lollygagging?

24:48.470 --> 24:49.487
I'm tired.

24:49.638 --> 24:52.214
I know you are, honey.
TK, diazepam, now.

24:52.233 --> 24:53.473
-Why?
-Because she's about to have a--

24:53.493 --> 24:55.976
-(screams)
-Alright, it's okay, ma'am.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.143
I got you. I got you.

24:57.221 --> 24:58.645
Can we get these handcuffs?

24:58.664 --> 24:59.830
(groaning)

24:59.982 --> 25:01.223
Alright, it's okay.

25:01.242 --> 25:02.908
Alright, we need
that line now, TK.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.335
I'm trying, Cap,
but I can't find a vein.

25:04.411 --> 25:06.078
TOMMY:
She's probably dehydrated.

25:06.154 --> 25:07.246
Her veins have collapsed.

25:07.398 --> 25:09.006
-You got the Veinlite?
-Yeah.

25:09.157 --> 25:10.156
-Here.
-Okay.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.301
(groaning sharply)

25:14.922 --> 25:16.013
TOMMY: Found one.

25:19.076 --> 25:20.476
Get ready to push.

25:21.169 --> 25:22.728
-TK: Okay.
-Got it?

25:23.581 --> 25:25.731
-Alright.
-Go.

25:30.178 --> 25:31.695
(exhales deeply)

25:33.440 --> 25:35.424
Mrs. Engel?

25:35.426 --> 25:37.109
Hey. Can you hear me?

25:37.185 --> 25:40.095
(weakly): Oh, dear.
What... What happened?

25:40.114 --> 25:41.263
Where am I?

25:41.265 --> 25:42.931
You just had a seizure, ma'am.

25:42.933 --> 25:44.283
Goodness.

25:44.435 --> 25:45.876
I need to get home
and feed my babies.

25:46.028 --> 25:47.269
No, no, no, no, no. You relax.

25:47.362 --> 25:50.105
We're gonna take you
to the hospital first. Alright?

25:50.124 --> 25:51.957
They're gonna give you
some antibiotics.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.051
Oh, my.

25:54.202 --> 25:56.554
I hope I wasn't
too much trouble.

25:56.705 --> 25:59.631
(whimsical music playing)

25:59.708 --> 26:02.601
Alright, ma'am, you hang on,
we're almost there.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.065
(Daphne groans softly)

26:08.292 --> 26:09.567
Let's clear a path.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.314
JUDD: Miss?
Can you reach my hand?

26:15.466 --> 26:16.699
DAPHNE: Yeah.

26:18.226 --> 26:19.151
The other hand.
The other hand.

26:19.227 --> 26:20.319
-DAPHNE: Yeah.
-There you go.

26:20.395 --> 26:21.996
(cries)

26:23.824 --> 26:25.140
JUDD: Backboard.

26:25.142 --> 26:26.642
Need you to wait
just a little bit.

26:26.660 --> 26:29.311
Hold tight, hold tight.
Just gotta lay you in there.

26:29.313 --> 26:30.754
I'm gonna put her right here.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.315
-MARJAN: Okay, guys.
-JUDD: Alright, guys,

26:33.317 --> 26:34.758
-get the other two.
-Nice and easy.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.428
Okay, on three.

26:37.504 --> 26:39.471
One, two, three.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.017
Alright, Captain.

26:45.496 --> 26:47.329
Hey, hon, I'm Tommy,
this is TK.

26:47.331 --> 26:48.272
We're gonna
take a look at that leg.

26:48.423 --> 26:50.332
I don't care about my leg.

26:50.351 --> 26:51.333
Brisket?

26:51.352 --> 26:52.425
Where is he?

26:52.445 --> 26:54.111
-Brisket?
-Whoa, whoa. Who's Brisket?

26:54.262 --> 26:56.113
He's my dog.
He's a white Shih Tzu.

26:56.264 --> 26:57.448
I lost him
when the shelves fell.

26:57.599 --> 26:59.174
OWEN:
Alright, everybody,
we're looking for

26:59.176 --> 27:01.009
a little white dog
named Brisket.

27:01.028 --> 27:02.286
ALL: Brisket?

27:02.437 --> 27:03.120
Brisket!

27:03.289 --> 27:05.289
-ALL: Brisket!
-Come here, boy.

27:05.366 --> 27:06.865
OWEN: Alright, whoa, whoa.
Stop everything.

27:07.017 --> 27:09.376
Ma'am, why don't you
try calling your dog?

27:09.945 --> 27:11.536
Bris... Brisket?

27:11.689 --> 27:13.689
-Come here, buddy.
-(Brisket barking)

27:13.707 --> 27:14.873
-Brisket...
-Hey, hey!

27:14.950 --> 27:16.708
Cap, I hear him.
He's under here!

27:16.861 --> 27:18.284
DAPHNE:
God, get him out of there!

27:18.304 --> 27:19.303
Don't-don't move.
Don't move, Daphne.

27:19.454 --> 27:21.121
You'll just
hurt yourself further.

27:21.198 --> 27:22.139
He's stuck.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.140
Mateo, how long will take you

27:23.291 --> 27:24.867
to reposition those airbags?

27:24.869 --> 27:26.201
Five minutes, Cap.

27:26.294 --> 27:27.811
Hey, we don't need the bags.

27:27.888 --> 27:29.146
I can see him! I can get him.

27:29.297 --> 27:31.373
-Paul!
-(grunting)

27:31.375 --> 27:32.391
Paul, what are you doing?

27:32.543 --> 27:34.151
Come on, boy.
(smacks lips)

27:34.302 --> 27:35.635
(barks)

27:35.655 --> 27:37.303
Okay, okay.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.156
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.933
Dr. Bruce Banner, let's go!

27:42.085 --> 27:43.143
Hi! Hi!

27:43.162 --> 27:45.412
-Really?
-What?

27:52.396 --> 27:55.080
The chicken needs
a few more minutes.

27:55.232 --> 27:56.899
Can I refresh your glass?

27:56.917 --> 27:58.509
CATHERINE: Oh, please.

28:00.421 --> 28:01.253
I have to say,

28:01.405 --> 28:03.830
dinner in
as the second date

28:03.908 --> 28:05.090
was quite the gambit.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.167
How's it going so far?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.927
No dirty dishes in the sink,

28:09.004 --> 28:10.095
weird stains on the carpet,

28:10.172 --> 28:11.580
or screams coming
from the basement.

28:11.598 --> 28:13.582
Yeah, I had the basement
sound-proofed.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.508
So what do you think?

28:15.586 --> 28:18.253
I love it.
Contemporary minimalist.

28:18.255 --> 28:20.180
Clean lines with no clutter.

28:20.257 --> 28:21.181
Not a fan of clutter.

28:21.258 --> 28:23.575
Hmm. A man after my own heart.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.430
How's the gambit coming?

28:28.449 --> 28:30.523
Well, I haven't
tried the chicken,

28:30.601 --> 28:34.044
but... it's trending
in the right direction.

28:37.107 --> 28:38.865
GINSBURG:
Get out of my house.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.943
Uh... What was that?

28:40.961 --> 28:42.294
Nothing.

28:42.446 --> 28:44.221
GINSBURG: I'm changing
the locks, butt face.

28:44.298 --> 28:46.448
Is there somebody else
in the house?

28:46.450 --> 28:48.875
No, not somebody. Something.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.287
Who's gonna get an extra hour
of cage cover in the morning

28:52.289 --> 28:53.455
if it doesn't shut up?

28:53.457 --> 28:54.806
-GINSBURG: Get over it.
-CATHERINE: Owen.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.400
Is there a bird in there?

28:58.220 --> 29:00.237
You didn't tell me
you're a bird person.

29:00.314 --> 29:02.055
-It's not my choice.
-GINSBURG: Get over it.

29:02.132 --> 29:03.223
(sighs)

29:03.300 --> 29:04.649
It's such a mood killer.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.392
I mean, that thing
eavesdropping on us.

29:06.487 --> 29:08.662
I would understand
if you'd wanted to just...

29:09.397 --> 29:10.080
call it a night.

29:10.232 --> 29:12.708
No. But I do wanna meet him.

29:14.495 --> 29:16.086
OWEN:
Catherine, meet Ginsburg.

29:16.163 --> 29:18.146
GINSBURG: Hello, butt face.

29:18.148 --> 29:19.631
Told you he was a jerk.

29:20.909 --> 29:23.093
CATHERINE:
Wow. He's so handsome.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.595
He's a macaw, right?

29:24.746 --> 29:25.745
You know your birds.

29:25.823 --> 29:27.656
We had
an African Grey growing up.

29:27.658 --> 29:29.433
Where'd this guy come from?

29:29.510 --> 29:32.603
My ex-wife left him to me
in her will.

29:32.679 --> 29:36.014
Obviously to torture me
for the rest of my natural life.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.258
Was she a vindictive person?

29:38.335 --> 29:41.670
No. She was kind.
She was very kind.

29:41.688 --> 29:46.116
Oh. So torturing you probably
wasn't high on the agenda.

29:46.268 --> 29:49.694
Maybe she thought you'd
take the best care of him.

29:49.771 --> 29:51.437
-Hmm.
-You know, he's grieving too.

29:51.515 --> 29:54.199
For a bird to lose his person
can be very painful.

29:54.276 --> 29:56.868
-(chattering)
-Tsk. Poor thing.

29:57.021 --> 29:58.854
GINSBURG
: Love you, honey.

29:58.856 --> 30:01.131
See? He's not so bad.

30:02.359 --> 30:04.802
Why don't you just
try petting his head?

30:04.878 --> 30:06.286
Uh... Alright.

30:06.363 --> 30:08.388
But my blood is on your hands.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.560
GINSBURG (squawks):
Sleep on the couch, butt face.

30:15.297 --> 30:17.389
Does he always
call you that, butt face?

30:17.483 --> 30:18.890
Yes. It's not funny.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.876
I mean, it's pretty funny.

30:20.894 --> 30:23.879
It's also probably
not a coincidence.

30:23.897 --> 30:26.064
-What do you mean?
-CATHERINE: Higher birds

30:26.141 --> 30:27.157
have more social neurons

30:27.309 --> 30:29.217
than any creature
in the animal kingdom.

30:29.236 --> 30:32.162
They pick up on
our feelings about them.

30:32.239 --> 30:34.556
As if he wasn't
creepy enough as it is.

30:34.558 --> 30:38.910
Is it possible that you had
some bad or traumatic experience

30:39.063 --> 30:40.587
with this guy in the past?

30:41.415 --> 30:42.230
There's nothing.

30:42.249 --> 30:45.233
He's just an irrational animal.

30:45.252 --> 30:47.252
I've never harmed
a gaudy feather

30:47.404 --> 30:49.847
on his gaudy little head.

30:49.998 --> 30:52.257
(oven dings)

30:52.409 --> 30:55.602
Except maybe cooking
his cousin for dinner.

30:57.172 --> 30:59.022
Let that be a warning to you.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.603
(bell rings)

31:04.679 --> 31:05.696
Whoa. Cap.

31:06.090 --> 31:08.181
Looks like you were
on the losing end of a brawl.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.759
A brawl called breakfast.

31:10.761 --> 31:14.538
Well, I take it those are
beak-related injuries there.

31:14.689 --> 31:17.115
Damn, that really is
a little demon bird, huh?

31:17.192 --> 31:18.950
I've always thought so.

31:19.103 --> 31:20.377
What do you mean?

31:20.454 --> 31:23.213
Well, right after
he did this to me,

31:23.365 --> 31:26.608
he ate a piece of cereal
out of Mateo's mouth

31:26.627 --> 31:27.551
and then kissed him.

31:27.628 --> 31:30.278
(chuckling)
Alright...

31:30.280 --> 31:31.722
So Mateo kissed a bird?

31:31.873 --> 31:33.465
Yeah, I mean...

31:33.541 --> 31:36.226
they seem to be
building quite a bond.

31:36.378 --> 31:38.729
Was it, was it
an open-mouth kiss?

31:38.956 --> 31:40.046
Was it a close-mouth kiss?

31:40.065 --> 31:42.048
That's not exactly
the point, Judd.

31:42.109 --> 31:45.551
So... Catherine said something

31:45.629 --> 31:49.389
that maybe the bird
has a personal grudge against me

31:49.483 --> 31:51.366
because of something
I did to it.

31:51.802 --> 31:52.910
Okay.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.303
Yeah, well, I haven't seen
the bird in 20 years,

31:55.322 --> 31:58.140
so that's insane, right?

31:58.142 --> 31:59.917
Well, animals know their people,

32:00.068 --> 32:02.477
and they don't ever forget.

32:02.496 --> 32:03.629
Oh. Yeah.

32:05.165 --> 32:07.832
I was afraid you'd say
something like that.

32:07.909 --> 32:10.677
Did you do something that you
would have beef with this bird?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.099
So after 9/11...

32:17.344 --> 32:19.661
I threw myself into my work.

32:19.663 --> 32:22.397
I was always at the firehouse.
I was never home.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.692
Even when I was, I wasn't.

32:26.853 --> 32:28.028
I wasn't home.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.858
And I started
drinking a lot and...

32:33.935 --> 32:36.436
Gwyn and I started fighting.

32:36.513 --> 32:39.581
And that bird
had a front-row seat.

32:40.184 --> 32:41.107
To all of it.

32:41.201 --> 32:44.186
And it was so protective of her.

32:44.204 --> 32:46.688
Squawk and snap and...

32:46.690 --> 32:48.590
whenever we fought, so I...

32:49.693 --> 32:52.094
I yelled at him,
"Shut up...

32:52.972 --> 32:54.554
butt face."

32:57.459 --> 33:00.644
So you called the bird
butt face first.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.605
It wasn't my finest hour.

33:05.818 --> 33:09.060
And I've been thinking
about the last thing
that I said to Gwyn,

33:09.137 --> 33:11.396
the night that I moved out.

33:11.473 --> 33:13.031
She had, um...

33:14.551 --> 33:16.827
She told me that
I had sucked the joy

33:16.829 --> 33:18.996
out of our family.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.415
And out of her.

33:23.651 --> 33:25.335
And what did you tell her?

33:26.154 --> 33:27.713
I told her to get over it.

33:30.584 --> 33:32.009
I've always regretted it.

33:33.403 --> 33:35.512
I always wanted
to apologize for it.

33:37.591 --> 33:39.516
Now she's gone. Well...

33:41.078 --> 33:42.686
I never will.

Marjan, where am I?

36:18.735 --> 36:19.718
Hospital.

36:20.620 --> 36:21.970
What?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.572
What happened?

36:24.633 --> 36:26.999
You don't remember
any of it, do you?

36:27.077 --> 36:28.602
No, no. No.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.354
I must have blacked out.

36:31.431 --> 36:34.357
Yeah, I got to you just in time.

36:34.434 --> 36:36.676
I had to kick in
your front door, though.

36:36.753 --> 36:39.070
Serves you right
for not answering my texts.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.199
That door is solid oak.

36:42.275 --> 36:44.609
Wasn't gonna keep me
from my best friend.

36:44.761 --> 36:46.611
Oh... I left the stove on.

36:46.688 --> 36:49.039
Hey, hey, no, the stove is off.
Everything's fine.

36:49.115 --> 36:50.432
Just try not to move

36:50.450 --> 36:51.933
and the doctor
should be here soon.

36:52.026 --> 36:54.461
What--
What is this?

36:57.958 --> 36:59.382
What is this?

37:00.034 --> 37:01.551
It's the battery.

37:01.628 --> 37:02.594
Battery?

37:03.129 --> 37:04.471
Battery to what?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.432
Your pacemaker.

37:13.623 --> 37:15.623
-You called 9-1-1?
-MARJAN: I did.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.567
And I rode with you
to the hospital, too.

37:17.719 --> 37:19.143
You had me pretty freaked out.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.529
And you let them
put this thing in me?

37:21.982 --> 37:23.556
Let them?

37:23.558 --> 37:25.909
Well, did they say
I was gonna die on
the table or something?

37:26.102 --> 37:27.244
They didn't exactly
consult with me.

37:27.395 --> 37:28.653
But you didn't stop them?

37:28.805 --> 37:29.913
MARJAN: Stop them?

37:30.064 --> 37:32.140
How was I supposed to do that?
And why would I?

37:32.158 --> 37:34.325
Because, because
you knew my wishes.

37:34.402 --> 37:37.087
You knew I didn't want this.
Why didn't you say anything?

37:37.163 --> 37:38.404
Hey. Paul, are you serious?

37:38.482 --> 37:40.498
It wasn't your choice to make.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.317
And I didn't make it.

37:42.319 --> 37:45.320
The doctors did. Your body did.
I saved your life.

37:45.322 --> 37:46.554

37:48.825 --> 37:50.100
Please leave.

37:53.013 --> 37:55.313

look at you right now.

37:57.834 --> 37:58.817

Okay. (sniffles)

38:02.764 --> 38:03.697
(exhales)

38:05.859 --> 38:06.992
Thank you.

38:08.361 --> 38:09.268
No problem.

38:09.346 --> 38:11.621
(somber music playing)

38:36.206 --> 38:37.388
Hello, Ginsburg.

38:37.465 --> 38:39.707
GINSBURG: (squawking)
Hello, butt face.

38:39.726 --> 38:40.400
OWEN: Yeah.

38:41.561 --> 38:44.379
Well, there comes a time
in every man's life

38:44.381 --> 38:46.406
when he's gotta eat
a little crow.

38:46.974 --> 38:48.158
(caws softly)

38:49.402 --> 38:53.054
Sorry, that was
an unfortunate turn of a phrase.

38:53.073 --> 38:54.998
(caws softly)

38:55.149 --> 38:56.374
I want to apologize...

38:57.169 --> 38:59.410
for being such a dick to you

38:59.563 --> 39:02.547
those last few months
we lived together in New York.

39:04.234 --> 39:05.967
To you and to her.

39:07.754 --> 39:10.088
In the, uh... (chuckles)
(sniffles)

39:10.240 --> 39:12.256
In the years since I've...

39:12.351 --> 39:15.393
tried to bury it, but, um...

39:17.263 --> 39:18.730
'Cause I was ashamed.

39:19.933 --> 39:22.192
I was mortified by my behavior.

39:22.268 --> 39:25.362
But now that you're here,
I can't hide it.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.348
Man, if I think it's messed up
that you're here,

39:29.426 --> 39:31.183
I can only imagine
what you feel

39:31.203 --> 39:32.702
or how much you miss Gwyn.

39:32.779 --> 39:33.853
(caws softly)

39:34.039 --> 39:36.498
You don't even understand
why things changed.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.502
I don't.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.051
I wonder,
did she have time to think?

39:49.295 --> 39:51.012
Did she see it coming?

39:53.225 --> 39:55.058
Was she scared or...

39:57.211 --> 39:58.803
Did she just blink her eyes

39:58.880 --> 40:00.605
and there was heaven?

40:03.476 --> 40:04.651
Or just black?

40:10.150 --> 40:12.650
Anyway... that's about it.

40:12.727 --> 40:13.993
Oh.

40:15.062 --> 40:17.539
I am sorry I called you
butt face.

40:19.066 --> 40:20.417
GINSBURG: Here's a blanket.

40:21.311 --> 40:22.326
What was that?

40:22.479 --> 40:24.963
GINSBURG:
I don't want you to get cold.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.151
The first night
I slept on the couch,

40:30.153 --> 40:32.637
Gwyn came out
and said that to me.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.557
And you heard it?

40:36.342 --> 40:38.309
GINSBURG: Love you, honey.

40:40.087 --> 40:41.563
(caws softly)

40:49.614 --> 40:52.097
TK:
Anyway, the wedding was
on this beach in Montauk

40:52.117 --> 40:54.342
and Mom was the maid of honor,

40:54.344 --> 40:56.360
and, uh, she asked me, she said,

40:56.513 --> 40:59.514
"TK, please don't wander off
while we do the pictures."

40:59.516 --> 41:03.851
But me being me,
of course, I wandered off.

41:03.870 --> 41:08.280
I went to the edge of this pier
and I fell in headfirst.

41:08.358 --> 41:11.134
I was maybe, I don't know, five.

41:11.285 --> 41:13.118
I didn't know how to swim.

41:13.196 --> 41:14.378
I didn't know which way was up.

41:14.531 --> 41:16.055
I was so scared.

41:17.534 --> 41:18.883
And suddenly...

41:19.035 --> 41:20.292
there was my mom.

41:20.386 --> 41:22.812
Heels and all,
plunging in after me,

41:22.964 --> 41:24.522
dragging me back to shore.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.558
Her dress was sopping,

41:27.711 --> 41:33.881
it was clinging to her
like this big beige beach towel.

41:33.883 --> 41:39.237
I said, "Mom, I'm, I'm so
sorry I ruined your dress."

41:39.389 --> 41:42.056
And she said,
"Honey, this dress was ruined

41:42.058 --> 41:43.833
before it even
landed on the rack."

41:43.910 --> 41:45.543
(laughter)

41:49.490 --> 41:52.091
Man, I haven't
thought about that in years.

41:55.421 --> 41:57.263
And I probably wouldn't have.

41:58.165 --> 42:00.058
If I didn't come here tonight.

42:02.003 --> 42:03.436
So, um...

42:04.856 --> 42:06.564
thank you for this.

42:07.008 --> 42:08.441
Yeah.

42:13.923 --> 42:15.031
Shh. Let's be quiet.

42:15.182 --> 42:16.849
He likes to go to bed early.

42:16.901 --> 42:20.328
It's gonna be like
Christmas morning
for him tomorrow.

42:21.614 --> 42:24.115
Gotta admit, pet store
was not on my bingo card

42:24.267 --> 42:25.357
for the third date.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.876
Is it wrong that I just
wanna wake him up

42:27.028 --> 42:27.952
and show him his toys?

42:28.029 --> 42:30.880
No. I think it's great.

42:31.032 --> 42:33.216
I hope these bite-proof gloves
do the trick.

42:33.401 --> 42:34.717
I had a rubber pair,
he chomped right through 'em.

42:34.794 --> 42:37.945
Yeah, our African Grey
used to do that once in a while

42:37.964 --> 42:39.514
when he was cranky.

42:40.450 --> 42:42.541
Is this really gonna be my life?

42:42.561 --> 42:44.118
CATHERINE: Okay. Owen?

42:44.137 --> 42:46.287
Take it easy. Don't spin out.

42:46.289 --> 42:47.972
I mean,
look at all of this stuff.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.066
I mean, I'm gonna die
a bird person.

42:50.143 --> 42:51.475
I mean, I-I should
talk to my lawyer

42:51.628 --> 42:53.552
to make sure he's
taken care of in my will.

42:53.572 --> 42:56.239
Okay, why don't, why don't
you just take a deep breath

42:56.316 --> 42:58.316
and go say hello to him?

42:58.392 --> 42:59.391
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.

42:59.469 --> 43:01.536
Good idea. Good, good idea.

43:03.323 --> 43:05.915
Ginsburg!

43:06.034 --> 43:07.542
Daddy's home.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.632
Huh.
