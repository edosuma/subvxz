00:01.392 --> 00:04.395
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.439 --> 00:06.397
The surgeon is going
to cut off her hip

00:06.441 --> 00:09.574
with a bone saw and
replace it with titanium.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.054
A bone saw?

00:11.098 --> 00:13.230
Yes, it's a saw used
to cut bone.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.625
Oh, look,
he's starting to cut.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.019
Oh, my...

00:19.062 --> 00:20.324
It is amazing,
isn't it?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
There's so much blood.

00:23.719 --> 00:27.070
Yes, the adult
human body holds

00:27.114 --> 00:28.898
one and a half gallons
of blood.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.293
Are you all right?

00:32.336 --> 00:34.643
Mm-hmm.

00:34.686 --> 00:35.905
No, you are not.
Sit down.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.083
Breathe.

00:41.258 --> 00:45.175
Okay. You're right.
I'm good.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.090
Totally good.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.874
I am not good.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.704
What's going on?

00:52.748 --> 00:54.358
How is Dele going
to become a doctor

00:54.402 --> 00:55.968
if he gets sick
at the sight of blood?

00:56.012 --> 00:57.709
Yeah, that's a problem.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.276
But better he found out now.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.843
Better for who?

01:00.886 --> 01:03.411
Everybody?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.245
What about these biology books?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.420
In the trash.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.465
This one looks kind of cool.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.032
Then you keep it.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
Okay.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.558
Microscope?

01:20.602 --> 01:22.734
Aw...

01:22.778 --> 01:24.823
I got that
for his third birthday.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.303
Third?

01:26.347 --> 01:28.175
What was I supposed to get him?

01:28.218 --> 01:29.611
A teddy bear?

01:29.654 --> 01:31.439
Put it in the box.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.224
You know,
I can't help thinking

01:34.268 --> 01:36.444
that maybe
you're overreacting.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.142
But then, that thought
just flies away.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.449
Here's something for Dele.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.625
It says here
the fastest growing field

01:43.668 --> 01:46.976
is software quality
assurance analysts.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.238
Dele will not do that.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.239
Why not?

01:49.283 --> 01:51.067
If I do not know
what it is,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.590
how can I brag
about him at church?

01:54.201 --> 01:55.854
Perhaps he should be
a lawyer.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.334
He would stay busy.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.641
Americans always want
to sue each other.Mm-hmm.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.947
I can picture
the billboards now.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.340
"Injury on the job?

02:03.384 --> 02:06.735
Call Dele
The Nigerian Hammer."

02:06.778 --> 02:09.390
You can always use a lawyer
in the family.

02:09.433 --> 02:12.306
More specifically,
I could use one next month.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.960
After winning several

02:15.004 --> 02:16.788
high-profile murder cases,

02:16.832 --> 02:20.096
he can easily transition
into politics.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.360
He does have
a likable face.Mm-hmm.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.275
"Vote Dele Adebambo

02:25.319 --> 02:28.452
for
The Nigerian Hammer."

02:29.758 --> 02:32.413
Does it bother you that they
talk like you're not here?

02:32.456 --> 02:33.805
Please don't
draw attention to me.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.851
Sorry.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.461
If he does go
into politics,

02:37.505 --> 02:39.724
someone might dig up
that my late husband and I

02:39.768 --> 02:41.944
were communists
for a couple of days.Mom.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.424
We thought it was
a swingers party.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.078
What do you want to do, Dele?

02:48.777 --> 02:50.866
I really don't
think it's my place.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.086
We know what is best
for Dele.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.307
Maybe, but even if you force him
to go to some fancy law school,

02:57.351 --> 02:59.918
there's no guarantee he's gonna
get a job out of it.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.572
What are you
talking about?

03:01.616 --> 03:04.575
Well, I used to date
a Harvard Law graduate.

03:04.619 --> 03:05.750
Glenn.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.752
Not traditionally
handsome, but cute.

03:07.796 --> 03:12.279
He had really short arms
like a tyrannosaurus rex.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.672
Cut to the closing
argument, honey.Um...

03:14.716 --> 03:16.500
Well, he was working
at a 24 Hour Fitness.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.849
Eh?

03:17.893 --> 03:18.937
That is impossible.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.157
Are you sure
it was the good Harvard?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
Well, he had the sweatshirt.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.466
Anyway,

03:25.509 --> 03:27.207
big firms are looking for people

03:27.250 --> 03:30.558
with a more well-rounded
liberal arts education.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.517
Abishola, explain to me
what she is saying.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.737
I do not know.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.218
She's saying where
and what you study in school

03:38.261 --> 03:40.132
doesn't really mean
as much as it used to.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.441
Does anyone know what
they are talking about?

03:44.485 --> 03:45.964
You've eaten at Chipotle, right?

03:46.008 --> 03:47.314
Oh, yes.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.098
I love the convenience
of fast food

03:49.141 --> 03:52.188
and the quality of
a casual sit-down.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.539
Their CEO got his degree
in art history.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.585
Heck, there are plenty
of billionaires

03:57.628 --> 03:58.586
that never even finished school.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.022
Oprah, Bill Gates.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.502
Look at me,
I'm a college dropout.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.593
Is this true?

04:05.636 --> 04:07.464
We do not speak
about it.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.249
I have a successful company.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.163
But imagine how much
better it would be

04:11.207 --> 04:12.687
if you had gotten
your degree.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.342
You know, it's not
too late for you.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.952
It is, and it's fine.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.606
No, it is not fine.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.957
Let us all calm down.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.089
Bob is not on trial here.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.352
Dele is.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.162
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.250
My daughter
will love these.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.773
It's great she wants
to be a doctor.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.080
Oh, she doesn't.
But now she will.

04:59.603 --> 05:02.171
Please send my condolences to
your wife for her tragic loss.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.346
It's not a loss.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.869
The kid's gonna be fine.Of course he will.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.786
If you ask me,

05:08.830 --> 05:10.571
planning out a child's life
at such an early age

05:10.614 --> 05:12.137
puts too much
pressure on them.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.661
Pressure builds character.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.185
It is how you separate
the strong from the...

05:16.228 --> 05:17.621
...Dele.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.364
My parents put
tremendous pressure on me

05:21.408 --> 05:23.540
and I always
resented them for it.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.107
See?Until I moved to America

05:25.150 --> 05:27.196
and saw how you raise
your children.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.067
With your hugging and your

05:29.111 --> 05:32.157
"You'll
get 'em next time, Cody."

05:32.201 --> 05:34.421
Cody
will not get them next time!

05:34.464 --> 05:35.726
All right, I'm stopping
the cycle.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.727
Give me back the box.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.250
Aw.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.513
And you know what?

05:39.556 --> 05:41.906
I'll bet Cody is damn happy.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.821
Actually, he was crying.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.128
Goodwin's daughter scored
11 goals on him.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.695
Geez, don't they have
a mercy rule?

05:47.738 --> 05:48.870
They do now.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.574
You will not
believe this.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.533
One of the patients
from the psych ward

05:59.576 --> 06:02.666
walked into my kitchen
and started peeling potatoes.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.407
Uh...
What did you do?

06:04.451 --> 06:07.236
I let her finish and then
I handed her some carrots.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.370
Hey, ladies.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.371
Hello.
Hello.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.720
Abishola?Hmm?

06:12.763 --> 06:13.634
I made you cookies.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.505
Mmm.Why?

06:15.549 --> 06:17.289
To cheer you up.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.335
You've been talking
about "Dele the doctor"

06:19.379 --> 06:20.423
as long as I've known you.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.946
I'm fine.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.426
I will take a cookie.Ah!

06:23.470 --> 06:25.385
They're not for you.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.169
I don't need cookies.
I need to move on.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.520
Honey, I am not
gonna let you

06:30.564 --> 06:31.782
bury your feelings.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.349
Yes, it's better
to eat them.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.395
Ah!

06:35.438 --> 06:37.962
Thank you, Gloria,
but this is not necessary.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.183
I stayed up two extra
hours last night,

06:41.226 --> 06:43.359
I missed my shows
and I burnt my finger.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.100
Let me console you, damn it.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.710
Fine.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.590
Oatmeal raisin
is not my favorite.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.243
Keep eating.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.815
Ah, there is my son.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.077
E kaasan, Dad.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.165
How are you doing?

07:07.209 --> 07:08.471
You have not called in days.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.517
I'm sorry.
Something has come up.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.606
Yes, your lunch.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.173
You heard?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.525
Everyone heard.

07:18.568 --> 07:19.830
You think it's funny?

07:19.874 --> 07:22.137
I am the same way with blood.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.530
When my auntie slaughtered

07:23.573 --> 07:26.054
one of the animals for dinner,
I could not watch.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.751
Nothing is quite as embarrassing

07:27.795 --> 07:29.971
as vomiting
on a headless chicken.

07:31.015 --> 07:34.062
I threw up on my mom's shoes.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.413
Okay, you win.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.417
But all is not lost.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.072
Now you will follow in
my footsteps.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.248
There is no blood
in engineering.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.119
Engineering?Yes.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.252
I have told everyone
that I work with.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.515
So you're going to
pick my career now?

07:52.559 --> 07:54.691
Obviously. I am your father.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.040
It should have been me
all along.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.304
How are you with heights?

07:59.348 --> 08:01.089
It does not make you sick,
does it?

08:01.132 --> 08:02.917
Not that I know of.Well,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.353
we cannot risk it.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.050
You have embarrassed
the family enough.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.705
This weekend, eat a big meal.

08:08.749 --> 08:11.142
Then, go to the top
of a tall building...

08:12.361 --> 08:14.189
...and look out a window.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.936
Let's up the resistance!

08:21.979 --> 08:23.285
I can't do it, Cole.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.113
You can do it, everybody!

08:25.156 --> 08:27.550
I said I can't do it,
you sexy bully!

08:28.812 --> 08:30.379
Oh, thank God.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.471
Hang on. I'm coming!

08:38.953 --> 08:40.563
Dele?

08:40.607 --> 08:41.608
Hi.

08:41.651 --> 08:42.826
Are you okay?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.612
No.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.744
Oh, come here.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
I'm sorry I'm so sweaty.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.151
Okay, we're gonna
head out.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.456
What do you think
of this guy?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.501
Swipe left
or swipe right?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.850
I don't want to see that.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.940
I know he's chunky,
but he's got a motorcycle.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.073
I'm not helping you pick out
my new stepdad.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.422
Slow down.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.467
I'm only looking for
a little slap and tickle.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.558
Says so on my profile.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.516
That's not even you,
that's Doris Day.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.736
I've been told I look like her.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.912
Christina.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.827
I've never been more glad
to take your call.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.962
I just wanted to let you know
that Dele is safe

09:32.006 --> 09:33.137
and here with me.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.140
I'm gonna do my best
to heal him, Bob.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.101
What are you talking about?

09:40.144 --> 09:41.755
He ran away.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.061
And he ran to me.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.628
Oh, my God, is he okay?

09:45.672 --> 09:47.630
He's fine.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.677
He hasn't said much yet,
but I'll get him to open up.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.635
That's what I do.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.637
Christina?Yes?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
This is not some
baby rabbit you found.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.293
You can't keep Dele.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.121
Oh, but they've
got the same innocent eyes.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.296
No.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.602
You bring him home
right now

10:02.645 --> 10:03.907
before Abishola finds out.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.474
I'm not gonna do that.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.215
Christina...

10:07.258 --> 10:09.478
Tell Abishola not to worry.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.175
Auntie Chrissy's got this.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.396
Crap.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.833
So Dele went
to Christina's, huh?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.705
I was wondering

10:18.748 --> 10:20.707
where he was going
when he ran out of here.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.360
You saw him
and you didn't tell me?

10:22.404 --> 10:23.884
I'm no rat.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.104
Abishola's already
stressed out,

10:27.148 --> 10:28.932
that's the last
thing she needs.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.368
She doesn't need to know.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.543
Well, I'm not gonna
lie to my wife.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.893
You're kidding, right?

10:32.936 --> 10:34.721
How are you gonna stay married?

10:34.764 --> 10:36.679
Trust. Communication.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.466
She's up there getting ready
for a nice night out,

10:41.510 --> 10:42.424
and you're gonna ruin it
with the truth?

10:43.991 --> 10:45.427
She does need a break.

10:45.470 --> 10:49.779
Then look her in the eye
and lie your ass off.

10:49.823 --> 10:52.608
It's how you show your love.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.394
Are you ready to go?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.833
Yeah.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.446
But it's because I love you.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.275
Okay...

11:08.276 --> 11:09.233
You kids have fun.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.061
I'll watch Dele.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.421
This ceremony is called chado.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.293
And right now,
your role in it

11:25.336 --> 11:27.730
is to just be present.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.863
I can do that.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.386
Have you had this before?

11:31.429 --> 11:32.735
Tea? Sure.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.823
Ah.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.999
This isn't just tea.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.219
It's matcha.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.873
It's what monks drink.

11:39.916 --> 11:44.094
Now, for usucha,

11:44.138 --> 11:47.358
or thinner tea,
we use less matcha.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.099
Makes sense.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.581
But this situation
calls for koicha.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.715
Full strength? Hai.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
Now,

12:00.807 --> 12:03.984
let's take a deep,
cleansing breath

12:04.027 --> 12:05.420
and have a sip.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.943
Okay.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.778
Do you really like this?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.388
No.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.782
It's not good.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.175
But...

12:21.218 --> 12:22.872
it's about the ritual.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.577
Yeah, it never gets better.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.537
Can I ask you something?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.582
Sure, anything.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.193
How do you deal with being

12:39.236 --> 12:40.847
such a disappointment
to your family?

12:41.978 --> 12:43.719
Wow.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.503
Somebody's been spending time
with Grandma Dottie.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.811
I mean that you left
your family's company

12:48.855 --> 12:51.074
and went against everything
they wanted you to do.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.816
Oh, that disappointment.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.514
Well, I hit a wall.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.734
Yeah, I kind of did, too.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.258
We had just had
another board meeting

13:01.302 --> 13:04.174
where nobody in the family
was listening to me.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.785
And I found myself fantasizing

13:05.828 --> 13:08.265
about making a pretty jacket
out of Grandma Dottie's skin.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.007
Wow.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.966
When I began wondering
if there would be

13:13.009 --> 13:16.056
enough skin left for shoes,
that's when I knew

13:16.099 --> 13:18.667
I needed to get out
of the situation.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.671
Does that answer your question?

13:24.499 --> 13:26.849
Honestly, I don't remember
my question.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.594
Well, be patient and
the universe will guide you.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.989
I was kind of hoping
you could do that.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.079
No, I can't.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.168
Oh, but I have tarot cards.

13:44.867 --> 13:45.955
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.174
Do you work here?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.089
Yes, sir,

13:49.132 --> 13:50.177
I took your order earlier.He is kidding.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.482
He likes to make jokes.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.093
Ah. Good one.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.140
I thought it was funny.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.490
Thanks. It's nice
to see you smiling.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.798
With a 2005 Merlot,
how could I not?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.321
This was a good idea.
Thank you.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.453
Of course.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.455
I know there's been
a lot going on,

14:07.498 --> 14:09.109
but think of this
as a little vacation.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.893
We're on a stress-free island.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.982
I like that.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.378
I can't help thinking
that even though

14:17.421 --> 14:19.380
he cannot stand
the sight of blood,

14:19.423 --> 14:21.686
Dele would have made
such a good doctor.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.384
Yeah, he would've.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.951
When he was little, we would do

14:24.994 --> 14:26.909
"Head, Shoulders,
Knees and Toes,"

14:26.953 --> 14:30.086
and he would recite
all 206 bones in the body.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.436
That's a much longer song.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.526
But not as useless.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.355
You're really gonna miss
your study buddy, huh?

14:39.617 --> 14:40.618
I am.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.361
It was just the two of us
for such a long time.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.365
I'm scared we are going
to lose that connection.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.150
Well, you ever think
about telling him that?

14:50.193 --> 14:51.238
Telling him what?

14:51.281 --> 14:52.413
That you're gonna miss him.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.936
Why would I do that?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.764
So he knows how you feel.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.418
He already knows how I feel.If he did,

14:57.461 --> 14:58.593
he wouldn't have gone
to Christina for help.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.987
What?What?

15:02.553 --> 15:05.252
Why would he go to Christina's,
and why would he need help?

15:05.295 --> 15:07.950
These are all great questions.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
Bob.All right,

15:09.996 --> 15:12.128
apparently he was upset
and he went to Christina's.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.000
But the important thing is,
he's fine.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.784
When did this happen?

15:15.827 --> 15:19.222
It might have been just
before we left for dinner.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.181
And you are only
telling me this now?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.660
I thought you could use a break.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.879
So you lied to me.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.054
I didn't lie,
I waited to tell you

15:25.098 --> 15:26.186
because I love you.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.363
I need the check.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.408
And you are...?Not the time.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.028
Hold a question

15:42.071 --> 15:43.899
you want answered
in your mind...

15:45.031 --> 15:46.423
...and then pull a card.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.777
Upright Strength card.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.346
This means inner courage,

15:56.390 --> 15:57.826
bravery,

15:57.869 --> 16:00.176
overcoming self-doubt.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.569
I know this is nonsense,

16:01.612 --> 16:03.745
but it kind of
makes me feel better.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
I get it.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.271
But don't call it nonsense,
you'll anger the cards.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.013
Dele!

16:11.057 --> 16:12.841
What do we do?Okay,

16:12.884 --> 16:15.191
let-let's stay calm and ask
how this is gonna go.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.845
Oh, my.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.675
Christina, open
this door right now.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.155
Okay, Abishola,
I can tell you're mad,

16:22.198 --> 16:23.417
but I need you to promise

16:23.460 --> 16:25.158
to open your ears
and your heart.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.463
Let me in
before I break down this door.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.900
Yep, no problem.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.164
How dare you run away
without my permission.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.469
I'm sorry, Mum.

16:32.513 --> 16:33.470
And you!

16:33.514 --> 16:35.385
What is wrong with you?

16:35.429 --> 16:37.344
You should have called me
the moment he arrived.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.780
Well, let me explain.

16:38.823 --> 16:39.999
Don't engage, just apologize.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
I'm sorry, Abishola.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.219
Why are you even here?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.699
Because I listen.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.006
Do you? 'Cause I just
told you not to engage.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.225
He thinks you're all
disappointed in him.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.488
I'm done.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.316
Why would you think that?

16:53.360 --> 16:54.709
Because you are.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.580
I am disappointed,

16:56.624 --> 16:57.668
but not in you.

16:57.712 --> 16:58.713
You've worked so hard

16:58.756 --> 16:59.931
for me to become a doctor.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.151
You have worked hard.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.761
And it is not fair.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.329
But you cannot control
the way your body betrayed you

17:06.373 --> 17:08.114
and ruined my shoes.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.333
I just wanted to make you proud.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.379
I am.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.381
You are the thing
I am most proud of.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.512
Even now?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.515
Even now.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.605
Don't worry.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.520
We'll find you a new plan.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.567
No.

17:27.698 --> 17:28.960
Excuse me?

17:29.004 --> 17:30.223
No new plan.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.834
Upright Strength card.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.968
I've done everything
you've ever asked,

17:37.012 --> 17:38.057
but I need a break.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.536
I don't want to be doctor Dele

17:39.580 --> 17:42.365
or lawyer Dele,
or engineer Dele.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.585
I just want to be me
for a minute.

17:47.718 --> 17:48.893
Fine.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.069
Really?

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
Really?Really?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.292
I can see that you are tired.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.165
And I know that very soon

17:59.208 --> 18:00.818
you will be ready
to work hard again.

18:00.862 --> 18:01.950
Of course.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.648
So have your break.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.085
Thank you, Mum.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.652
We will not talk about
your future for two weeks.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.177
I'll take it.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.440
Let's go home.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.355
A-And any time I can be

18:15.398 --> 18:17.139
a vessel for healing,
please use me.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.794
Vessel? Sure.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
Christina.Yes?

18:24.668 --> 18:25.887
You are a good auntie.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.281
Thank you.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.499
But I am still angry
with you.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.631
Yeah, fair enough.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.378
I'm a good auntie.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.734
We're home.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.344
Welcome back.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.085
Dele's already in bed.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.174
He wore himself out
reading me Bible stories.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.438
Hello.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.663
Oh...

19:02.706 --> 19:05.274
So, you were also
a part of this whole thing?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.797
Absolutely not.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.886
I'm just as much a victim
as you are.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.541
Good night.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.326
Good night, sweetie.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.199
You see how happy
she was I lied?

19:18.679 --> 19:20.681
Good night, Mom.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.117
Really?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.337
This is the thanks I get
for saving your marriage?
