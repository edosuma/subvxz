[whoosh]

21:32.058 --> 21:33.491
[electricity crackling]

21:40.799 --> 21:42.867
And so it's come to this--

21:42.869 --> 21:45.603
No home, no best friend...
[sniffles]

21:45.605 --> 21:49.607
And sleeping under a bus stop.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.575
Hello, little nematode.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.411
Will you be my friend?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.212
That a boy.

21:55.214 --> 21:58.649
[giggles]
that tickles!

21:58.651 --> 22:01.419
Hey, my wallet!

22:01.421 --> 22:03.054
Good thing I canceled
those credit cards.

- [grunts]

22:04.057 --> 22:05.156
- Gary.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.191
I mean--oh, hey.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.061
What are you doing here--
waiting for a bus?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.630
[slurping]

22:12.632 --> 22:14.131
Oh, gary.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.168
Does this mean you've come to
love me more than that chew toy?

22:17.170 --> 22:18.269
- [grunts]

22:18.271 --> 22:20.638
- Yippee!

22:20.640 --> 22:23.774
Look, we're closer than ever.
[laughs]

22:23.776 --> 22:25.776
Come on, gary, let's go home.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.311
[sniffs]

22:27.313 --> 22:28.479
Do you smell something burning?

22:28.481 --> 22:32.350
[explosion, whistling]

22:32.352 --> 22:34.151
Hey, look,
isn't that your ball?
