00:01.668 --> 00:03.036
ALL EVENTS AND CHARACTERS
PORTRAYED HEREIN ARE FICTITIOUS.

00:03.103 --> 00:04.671
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.359
-Let's go.
-Give us another week, please.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.696
No way! Get your stuff out now
or leave it behind.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.565
We have to leave, honey.

00:32.632 --> 00:34.434
No, I won't go anywhere.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.238
Let me go!

00:40.940 --> 00:43.476
Let me go, bastard!

00:44.644 --> 00:47.247
Let me go!

00:47.547 --> 00:48.915
Shut up, bitch!

00:50.016 --> 00:54.154
My house!
My stuff!

02:00.220 --> 02:04.657
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

02:09.863 --> 02:13.066
Train 1123.
Do you copy me?

02:35.722 --> 02:36.823
Does it happen frequently?

02:37.824 --> 02:42.595
It depends.
It can happen twice a week.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.566
Once a month.
Suddenly, they disappear.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.371
But sooner or later
they are back, waiting for us.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.942
Did you report it?

02:56.609 --> 02:58.111
Many times.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.512
Where? At the court?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.548
The police are no good.
They don't do anything.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.982
You must go see a judge.

03:03.249 --> 03:07.353
What can we tell him?
We don't how, where or who.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.925
This happened to Carranza?

03:15.895 --> 03:18.398
The kid he hit was doing this?

03:18.831 --> 03:20.934
You'd better get off
at the next station.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.705
I want to continue
talking to you, Lucio.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.144
I don't.
You aren't supposed to be here.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.512
It's my job.
It is dangerous.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.084
Let's meet some other time then.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.287
I'll call you.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.730
-Did you get on the train?
-Yes, luckily.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.599
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
learned about it.

04:59.666 --> 05:00.633
These people are very quiet.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.869
Train drivers, I mean.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.305
Not like the engines they drive.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.473
Aren't there cameras
at the railway crossings?

05:07.540 --> 05:10.109
Yes, but most of them
don't work.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.845
I want to find out
how many people died...

05:13.112 --> 05:16.249
this year and the previous ones
on the tracks.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.617
Fine, but don't get
just figures.

05:17.884 --> 05:21.154
Figures are boring.
We need a story, Vero.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.356
You should focus on the kids,
not on the figures.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.159
This is something serious, Pato.
Look.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.028
This is an article from 2011.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.863
It doesn't go too deep.
But it is clear.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.499
I don't know who wrote it.
It is not signed.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.438
All right. Let me see
what I can do about it.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.306
Fine.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.085
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.853
Patricia told me
you are writing an article...

05:53.920 --> 05:55.455
about the train driver
who committed suicide.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.624
Yes, though it's much
more complex than that.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.893
Remember not to make
the mistake you made last time.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.830
-I will.
-That's good.

06:05.131 --> 06:08.201
You'll learn some things
only through experience.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.207
-Anything else?
-No.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.843
-What about you?
-Nothing.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.555
Lunch time, babe.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.924
Here you are.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.033
I don't get it.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.803
Its stomach is made of iron.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.372
Did you put enough poison?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.742
Yes, a lot.
The whole pack.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.112
Okay, let's go.
We'll be late for school.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.680
You should go.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.484
I'll fetch some detergent
and I'll put it in the water.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.986
That damn dog must die.

07:00.653 --> 07:04.323
He is alive.
Forget it. Let's go.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.829
Are you going
to that lousy club today?

07:10.897 --> 07:12.999
You're jealous
because you were not asked.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.500
Yes, sure.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.837
Yes, today at00 p.m.
Why?

07:18.404 --> 07:21.307
Nothing.
I had something to do.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.376
But if you can't come with me,
I'll tell Martina.

07:24.577 --> 07:29.816
Come and take the test.
I'll talk to the coach.

07:30.850 --> 07:35.154
No way!
Besides, my ankle still hurts.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.556
Come on!

07:36.622 --> 07:37.890
Damn!

07:40.960 --> 07:44.330
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.699
-Let me get you some water.
-No, I'm okay.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.434
I'll get you some water.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.584
How are you, Leti?
Where is dad?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.353
He is with a client.
He'll be with us soon.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.888
I got something for Benja.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.226
Money.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.829
-Has Dani arrived yet?
-Yes, she is at the restroom.

09:24.363 --> 09:28.234
-Hi. How are you?
-Take a seat.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.936
What happened to you yesterday?

09:31.537 --> 09:34.807
-I had a very busy day.
-What a shame!

09:34.874 --> 09:37.143
I had bought Benja
the car racing track you asked.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.278
But I left it in the cab.
I'm so dumb.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.147
You should've bought him
another one.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.149
They are sold at any toy store.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.984
What did you want
to talk to me about?

09:47.954 --> 09:50.456
I'm writing an article
about train accidents.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.058
Not on the train itself
but on the tracks.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.727
I wanted to know
what happens at the clinic.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.128
Do you get a lot of cases
like these?

09:56.195 --> 09:57.997
Are most of them children?

09:58.064 --> 09:59.899
That is why you came
to have lunch with us?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.802
It's unbelievable.
You'll never change.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.804
I'll tell dad to hurry up.

10:08.641 --> 10:12.244
You should've come!
We all waited for you yesterday.

10:12.311 --> 10:13.746
Especially Benja.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.848
You seem to be
his favorite aunt now.

10:15.915 --> 10:20.186
I meant to be there.
But something came up. Really.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.521
-I know those things happen.
-I got home very late.

10:22.588 --> 10:24.690
I wanted to kill myself
when I saw the time.

10:25.825 --> 10:26.926
I saw something terrible.

10:27.259 --> 10:29.895
Don't say anything to me.
Talk to Leti. Explain it to her.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.098
And to dad.
He was also very upset.

10:32.431 --> 10:37.069
Well, we rarely see
those cases at the clinic.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.505
When a train hits somebody,
nothing is left.

10:39.772 --> 10:40.973
It goes directly to the morgue.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.608
But some of them get away.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.543
Yes, but they aren't taken
to a private clinic.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.846
They are usually taken
to public hospitals.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.214
Because of their social status.
They are lower-middle class.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.784
What does their social status
have to do with it?

10:51.851 --> 10:53.052
You're kidding me?

10:53.119 --> 10:54.787
That's a fascist comment, Dani.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.089
It's not an opinion,
it's a fact.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.392
You ask me, I answer.
It's like that.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.095
Were there accidents
where kids were involved?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.964
I didn't see any.

11:05.231 --> 11:09.568
If you wish, I can
call some friends...

11:09.635 --> 11:13.072
who work in public hospitals
to see what happens there.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.741
-Will that help?
-Yes, thanks.

11:17.610 --> 11:18.644
Won't you stay for lunch?

11:18.711 --> 11:21.180
I'm sorry. I'm too busy.
Hello, Pato.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.350
I found it out.
Her name is Beatriz Frías.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.619
This is her telephone number.

11:26.919 --> 11:30.956
You read the article.
It's in general terms.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.460
I got some data by chance.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.797
A safety barrier guard.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.999
He was on duty
at the railway crossing.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.701
There was a boy
looking for a tennis shoe.

11:41.967 --> 11:46.172
Who told him he had lost
his shoe the night before.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.406
In a competition.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.408
What do you mean
by competition?

11:49.742 --> 11:51.911
He was competing
with another boy...

11:51.977 --> 11:53.979
to see who stayed
on the tracks the longest.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.648
Do you have the name
of the safety barrier guard?

11:55.948 --> 11:58.417
-Can I talk to him?
-No, that's impossible.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.786
He is in a coma.

12:01.087 --> 12:04.023
He was run over by a car
on his way out of a disco.

12:04.356 --> 12:05.858
I guess he was drunk.

12:07.593 --> 12:11.397
-Do you remember his name?
-Yes, Alberto Lette.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.065
Double T.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.335
He asked me not to include
his name in the article.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.037
That's why
I didn't mention him.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.772
You had a lot of information,

12:19.839 --> 12:22.675
why didn't you include
any details?

12:22.742 --> 12:27.213
I could never relate the kids
to the competition.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.715
I had no witnesses.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.685
Most of his relatives
lived in the provinces.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.754
They went back home.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.822
I had to hand in the article.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.692
And that is what I did.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.230
I'm afraid
there is no room for you now.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.464
Maybe some time in the future.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.932
I'll let you know
through your friend.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.237
Fine.
My ankle hurts anyway.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.173
Come and see
a training session though.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.242
He can't even take the test?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.543
Not for the time being.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.712
If something comes up,
I'll let you know.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.547
Come on, boys.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.653
At least we tried.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.588
Fuck him!

13:09.655 --> 13:12.591
Who does he think he is?
I don't care!

13:12.925 --> 13:14.493
There are hundreds of clubs
like this.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.629
I'll go somewhere else.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.666
How did you do?

13:21.867 --> 13:23.536
-Where?
-In River.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.305
Just fine.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.908
They said they'd call.
I have to wait and see.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.410
He is a friend of mine.
We call him "Dientes".

13:31.477 --> 13:32.678
He plays in the ninth position.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.747
-Or in the fifth.
-Yes, it depends.

13:35.114 --> 13:38.017
-Did you take the test?
-No, my ankle hurts.

13:38.684 --> 13:41.120
-Would you like some Coke?
-We don't have any money.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.356
I do.
We'll buy a big bottle.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.563
This is Carranza.
The guy who committed suicide.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.231
And this is Lucio Valrossa.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.601
He is hot.
Where did you get the picture?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.269
I sent Diego Malvino,

13:57.336 --> 13:59.071
the only train driver
who is single,

13:59.138 --> 14:00.773
a friend request on Facebook.
From a fake profile.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.007
And he confirmed it.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.009
I can't believe
you're having sex with him.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.044
-Who? Lucio?
-Come on!

14:05.444 --> 14:07.580
He is really handsome.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.848
This is not
a good picture though.

14:09.215 --> 14:12.551
Maybe, but I can only speak
based on what I see there.

14:12.818 --> 14:13.853
He is handsome.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.588
There is another picture
where he looks much better.

14:15.654 --> 14:16.689
Show it to me.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.791
This is a mess.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.702
What are you doing?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.470
Can you help me?
I'm taking all out.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.840
-Everything?
-Yes, that's right.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.422
You're quite a detective.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.794
Who is it?

14:57.196 --> 14:58.864
-The cute guy.
-Who?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.234
The guy I met at the bar
the other night.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.037
How on earth
did he get my number?

15:05.104 --> 15:08.641
I'm sure it was Pili.
She is so dumb.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.210
What are you saying to him?

15:12.211 --> 15:14.046
I'll give him a second chance.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.148
We've talked about it
many times, Vero.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.950
You don't know him.
It's dangerous.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.518
If I were a man,
you wouldn't say that.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.254
But you are not.
Please, Verónica.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.124
Is he calling you now?

15:25.557 --> 15:27.059
No, it's Valrossa.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.297
Hello.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.465
Hello.
We're back from the funeral.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.669
I talked to Carina,
Carranza's sister.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.138
She told me you helped them
get the corpse.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.308
No, it wasn't me.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.542
I talked to a friend
who knows the D.A.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.944
It must've been him.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.546
Thank your friend
for us, please.

15:49.515 --> 15:50.783
Bye.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.524
Everything all right?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.561
Have you talked to your sister?

16:02.828 --> 16:03.963
No, I'll cancel.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.666
No, don't cancel.
I'll start the fire.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.501
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.138
Call her.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.375
Training is over.

16:49.942 --> 16:53.545
Leave your vests here, ladies.
Good practice.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.553
Peque, come here.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.526
You did it very well.
You're improving.

17:07.793 --> 17:08.827
Yes, I feel good.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.697
You may be a fixed player
in the next match.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.298
-Really?
-I said maybe.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.967
I have to think about it.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.003
I need an authorization
from your parents.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.538
The match is in Ciudadela.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.173
Otherwise, they will have
to take you there.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.641
They can't.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.111
My mother doesn't have a car
and she works all day.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.647
-What does she do?
-She is a cleaning lady.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.816
-What about your dad?
-I don't have one.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.185
We'll work it out.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.787
We'll probably leave from here.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.155
When I know for sure,
I'll give you...

17:36.221 --> 17:37.656
the authorization
your mother must sign.

17:38.690 --> 17:39.892
You may go now.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.710
Let me see
what I can find, Vero.

17:58.777 --> 17:59.978
Thanks, Fede.
Could you also...

18:00.045 --> 18:02.281
find out something
about Alberto Lette?

18:02.347 --> 18:05.684
A safety barrier guard.
If you can, obviously.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.088
My life is not just
about doing favors to you.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.357
I know.
I'll make it up to you.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.595
What happened with the gun?
Have you talked to the driver?

18:16.862 --> 18:18.931
I have.
He said the same thing.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.766
He has no idea how it got
into Carranza's hands.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.167
And did you believe him?

18:23.535 --> 18:24.570
Why shouldn't I?

18:24.636 --> 18:26.638
Because you're the most
mistrustful person in the world.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.281
-Hello, dad.
-Hi.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.753
-You are mad at me.
-No, happy as a lark.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.422
I've talked
to Benja and Leticia.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.324
I apologized to them.
What else can I do?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.826
I want to understand.
What are you up to?

18:48.760 --> 18:51.630
I am working very hard.
It is a complex story.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.098
Fine, but family comes first.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.900
If we have no family,
we have nothing.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.001
Don't forget that.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.095
By the window?

19:31.670 --> 19:32.871
What would you like to drink?

19:32.938 --> 19:35.507
-Black coffee.
-Two coffees, please.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.314
Why did Carranza have your gun?

19:43.549 --> 19:44.816
I told you, I don't know.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.952
What's your theory?

19:47.553 --> 19:50.355
As far as I know,
guns don't walk.

19:50.789 --> 19:51.924
The only thing I know is
that's the gun he used...

19:51.990 --> 19:52.925
to kill himself.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.396
Maybe someone took it
away from you...

19:57.462 --> 19:59.264
and gave it to him
to get you involved.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.768
-Involved in what?
-In all this.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.102
What is all this?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.004
Who would want
to get me involved?

20:06.071 --> 20:07.706
I don't know, Lucio.
That's why we're talking.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.776
Write down in your story
that the gun was...

20:10.842 --> 20:13.579
the way Carranza found
to get some peace, Verónica.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.189
Thanks.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.927
I'd like to talk
to Sandra, his wife.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.130
Carina Carranza volunteered
to ask her to see me.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.599
But since you are here...

20:36.802 --> 20:39.171
Forget it.
I'll call Carina later on.

20:39.238 --> 20:44.176
-I'll see what I can do.
-As you please. Thanks.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.981
I used to come to this bar
with my dad when I was a kid.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.918
I had a sandwich at the counter
and he had some vermouth.

20:54.786 --> 20:58.056
-I never came back here.
-Even though you work nearby.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.592
That's life!

21:01.627 --> 21:03.929
Is the interview over
or there are more questions?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.364
It's over.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.334
I'd like to know more
about what we saw...

21:09.401 --> 21:10.502
the other night.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.005
But that's not the reason
why you are here.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.477
It isn't?
What did I come here for?

21:19.645 --> 21:21.146
Are you a natural brunette?

21:23.148 --> 21:24.883
Yes, I'm a natural brunette.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.219
I used to dye my hair
but not anymore.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.923
-What's your wife's name?
-Mariana.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.660
-Your children?
-Patricio and Fabián.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.895
My father is Raúl.
My mother is María Angélica.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.363
My dog is Ulises.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.567
-Do you smoke a lot?
-Quite a lot.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.237
I also smoke pot.
And I like whisky.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.571
In case you're interested.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.775
Anything else?

23:48.927 --> 23:51.530
Yes, I want that too.

23:51.863 --> 23:52.964
What's wrong?

23:53.031 --> 23:55.333
I wanted to know
if I'm going to play, Rivero.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.102
You said I could
be a fixed player.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.605
I'll call you back.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.643
-Did I tell you that?
-Yes, yesterday.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.513
I haven't made up
my mind yet.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.682
I can hit the ball
with my head.

24:10.749 --> 24:11.950
And kick it
with my left foot too.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.652
That's great.
Are you really strong?

24:13.718 --> 24:15.487
Or they kick you in the leg
and you start crying?

24:15.554 --> 24:17.656
-I'm very strong.
-Are you sure?

24:18.190 --> 24:19.691
I go up against anybody.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.261
It's a very difficult match.
You've got to have balls.

24:23.728 --> 24:26.765
I have very big balls.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.634
Look at you!
Come here.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.240
All right.
Then you are in.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.977
But you can't get cold feet.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.213
-You mustn't back out.
-Okay.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.316
Go practise.

25:02.467 --> 25:03.568
Nice helmet.

25:06.204 --> 25:08.306
Was he really hit by a car?

25:08.373 --> 25:10.308
Yes, at least that is
what the judge ruled.

25:10.575 --> 25:13.044
It was not Lette but Lete.
Single T.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.446
It was very hard for me
to find him.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.281
Was he very drunk?

25:16.348 --> 25:18.183
Yes, his blood alcohol content
was two percent.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.351
Totally drunk.

25:20.485 --> 25:22.954
What about the note
I gave you?

25:23.021 --> 25:25.056
I couldn't take care of that.
It's complicated.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.592
I must go to court
and ask for the file.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.629
Don't worry, Fede.
I'll do it.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.498
Write a permission note for me
and I'll go to court.

25:33.565 --> 25:36.368
You don't need a note.
Your last name is all you need.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.670
You just say you're
Aaron Rosenthal's daughter.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.982
Is that you, Rafa?

25:52.183 --> 25:53.685
Long time no see!

25:53.752 --> 25:54.853
How are you, Droopy?

25:54.920 --> 25:57.022
I thought you were in jail.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.258
No, I'm fine.
How is Claudia?

26:00.525 --> 26:02.394
She's fine.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.864
No, she is not fine.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.901
She is in hospital.
She's got Aids.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.203
Are you serious?
I'm so sorry.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.607
-Tell her I say hi.
-I will.

26:16.274 --> 26:17.442
Nice seeing you.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.845
Wait! We haven't seen
each other for so long!

26:20.912 --> 26:22.781
Stay with me for a while.

26:23.481 --> 26:25.116
I'm so happy to see you.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.721
We'll get together
at Mario's this evening.

26:29.788 --> 26:30.789
Why don't you come over?

26:30.855 --> 26:32.724
I can't, Droopy.
I'm seeing my girl today.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.093
I didn't remember
you had a daughter.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.494
-What was her name?
-Martina.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.763
-Nice name.
-That's right.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.932
-How is she?
-Fine. She's beautiful.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.936
Go visit her
and then come with us.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.605
Bring some beer.

26:46.671 --> 26:48.373
Don't reject my invitation.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.175
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.476
You promise?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.612
-Yes.
-See you.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.647
-Nice seeing you.
-Bye.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.321
This is warm.
Did you turn off the fridge?

27:03.388 --> 27:07.692
-No, the beer is cold.
-That is not true.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.364
-That's 70 pesos?
-Yes, everything goes up.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.868
Turn on the fridge next time.

27:29.948 --> 27:32.584
Do you know that man?

27:32.951 --> 27:34.519
No, I don't know who he is.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.123
Shall we go
to the Chacarita match...

27:38.189 --> 27:40.892
-next Sunday?
-Maybe.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.406
He is alive.
Thank God!

27:55.373 --> 27:57.642
I gave him poison.
I want him to die.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.911
I don't want him to live.
Damn dog!

28:00.178 --> 28:03.748
I felt sorry afterwards.
I had bad dreams last night.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.350
You are just a chicken.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.318
Did you add detergent?

28:07.652 --> 28:10.255
There wasn't any at home.
My mother didn't have any.

28:10.321 --> 28:13.158
-But I added limestone.
-Limestone?

28:13.224 --> 28:15.794
Yes, I got it from the highway
construction work.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.595
Let's wait and see.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.464
I won't stay to see this.
I'm leaving.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.404
Will you be a fixed player?

28:27.005 --> 28:28.139
I think so.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.275
You aren't sure?

28:30.608 --> 28:32.210
He said I was the one.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.015
The one?
You are so dumb.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.883
All coaches say the same
and they never let you play.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.452
He will let me play.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.593
He is going to die.

28:48.993 --> 28:50.562
If not, you know
what I will do.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.564
I'll get a gun at the slums
and shoot him.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.934
I'm on the train.
I'm about to depart.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.569
Can we talk later?

28:57.635 --> 29:00.905
Just one question.
Did you ask Carranza's wife?

29:01.172 --> 29:04.342
Yes, but she wouldn't
talk to you.

29:05.176 --> 29:08.980
Thanks anyway.
I'll talk to you later.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.926
Hello.

29:29.634 --> 29:31.569
What can I do for you?

29:31.970 --> 29:35.173
I'm doing some research
on minors hit by trains.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.209
What court are you from?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.445
From Rosenthal's law firm.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.915
You don't work
in a court of law?

29:43.982 --> 29:45.517
I'm Aaron Rosenthal's daughter.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.385
Aaron Rosenthal?

29:51.189 --> 29:53.558
-Come with me.
-Thanks.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.148
Here it is.

30:17.782 --> 30:20.084
Here you will find cases
from the last five years.

30:20.351 --> 30:23.421
Call me if you need something.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.156
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.234
Seven accidents
involving children...

31:09.300 --> 31:11.369
in the last five years.
All of them very confusing.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.571
Two deadly ones.
One of them is Carranza's.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.139
Four of the children
got severely injured.

31:15.406 --> 31:16.941
And only one
miraculously saved his life.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.310
-All in different stations?
-Yes.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.814
This is not a child's game.
These kids are not playing.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.516
Someone makes them
do what they do, to compete.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.318
What's the next step?
What do you have in mind?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.487
Héctor Amante called me.
Do you know who he is?

31:29.787 --> 31:30.788
What did he say?

31:30.855 --> 31:32.657
He left a message
saying one of the workers...

31:32.724 --> 31:36.060
called him to say
a reporter was asking around.

31:36.361 --> 31:37.795
Never mind.
He talked bullshit.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.365
But I want to meet with him.
To see what he has to say.

31:41.065 --> 31:45.770
Okay, I'll support you.
But you can't go on forever.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.213
What is it, Dani?

31:55.513 --> 31:56.948
I have a friend who works
at Clínicas hospital.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.817
She says there is a victim
of a train accident there.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.454
He was hit
but he didn't get killed.

32:03.521 --> 32:04.956
He is in a coma.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.124
What's his name?

32:06.190 --> 32:07.525
I don't know.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.396
The weird thing is
he's a safety barrier guard.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.331
A safety barrier guard?

32:14.198 --> 32:15.900
Isn't he Alberto Lete?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.069
I don't know. I didn't ask.
I can find it out.

32:18.336 --> 32:19.504
Yes, please.

32:20.038 --> 32:23.775
Tell him what happened
to your friend Lorena.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.446
They bully her at school.
They call her names.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.915
-Silly, dumb, idiot.
-All those names?

32:31.449 --> 32:32.517
And many more.

32:32.583 --> 32:35.219
-But you don't, do you?
-Of course not.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.155
Someone has to defend
that girl.

32:37.221 --> 32:41.092
Don't tell her that.
Do you want her to get hurt?

32:41.159 --> 32:43.227
-Let me talk to her.
-No, stay out of it, mom.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.729
Take the girl inside, Gloria.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.499
-Calm down.
-Do as I say, please.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.102
What the hell are you doing?

32:51.169 --> 32:52.503
She is my daughter too.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.339
Nice way to take care of her.
You asked her to lie for you.

32:54.772 --> 32:58.176
No, she didn't want
you to get upset.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.510
She knows what I think
about you.

32:59.577 --> 33:00.611
She knows it is true.

33:00.678 --> 33:01.846
I am okay, Andre.
I swear.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.147
Don't call me that.

33:04.015 --> 33:06.351
I haven't had anything
for months.

33:06.417 --> 33:07.585
Not even alcohol.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.487
Do you want me
to give you a medal?

33:09.554 --> 33:12.690
No, not a medal.
Just understand me, Andrea.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.226
You're right.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.396
I shouldn't have come
without your permission.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.766
I couldn't find another way
to do it.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.870
I've found it out.
So it's over, Rafael.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.606
Don't do this to me.
She needs me.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.442
She needed you.
That was a long time ago.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.844
And you weren't there.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.812
Now the best thing for her
is to be away from you.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.114
Please, Andrea.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.850
How many times you got clean
and you got dirty again?

33:39.250 --> 33:40.785
Two hundred times?

33:41.886 --> 33:45.156
People like you don't change.
You can cheat yourself.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.158
You may believe you will change
but you won't.

33:48.326 --> 33:49.994
Stay away from the girl.

33:50.061 --> 33:52.930
Don't make me hire a lawyer.
I don't have money for that.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.600
Don't screw up my life again.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.216
This way.
Take a seat.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.552
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

34:20.491 --> 34:22.427
Can I have you mobile phone,
please?

34:23.761 --> 34:25.229
It's not something personal.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.898
It's just
that I don't know you.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.334
Here it is.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.545
Let me explain something to you.

34:40.611 --> 34:43.614
The train drivers are nervous
and it is understandable.

34:43.881 --> 34:46.717
When there are reporters around,
there is trouble.

34:46.984 --> 34:49.787
They call me and I try
to find answers for them.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.490
That's what the union is for.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.226
I thought your duty
was to protect them.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.462
You don't have to protect
them from me.

34:57.728 --> 34:58.729
I'm here to help.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.601
I'm writing an article
on accidents on the tracks.

35:03.868 --> 35:05.236
I'm focusing on train drivers.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.505
The state of their psyche
after an incident like this.

35:08.072 --> 35:11.042
Wait a minute.
Let me tell you something.

35:11.342 --> 35:12.710
If you're driving a car
and a person suddenly...

35:12.777 --> 35:15.613
appears in front of you,
you can turn the wheel quickly.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.882
You can't do that on a train.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.951
What do I mean by this?

35:20.218 --> 35:22.820
You have to be careful
with what you write.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.591
What do you mean?

35:27.091 --> 35:29.026
How does the company look?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.763
That depends on what the company
does to protect them.

35:32.830 --> 35:33.931
There is a protocol.

35:33.998 --> 35:37.101
Therapy.
A two-month sick leave.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.470
Then they are discharged
and drive the train again.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.007
Don't you find it terrible?

35:43.074 --> 35:45.810
-It depends.
-On what?

35:46.077 --> 35:47.512
On each case.

35:47.578 --> 35:51.482
We want to change things
but employees don't cooperate.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.351
They want to come back to work
as soon as possible.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.086
Because they lose money.

35:56.454 --> 35:57.755
So?

35:57.822 --> 36:00.858
Things work fine
just as they are.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.094
Somehow they work.

36:04.862 --> 36:06.197
Yes, sure.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.366
A week ago a train driver
committed suicide.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.501
But things work.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.271
And a butcher and a lawyer.

36:13.538 --> 36:16.741
Near my home, a pregnant woman
jumped off the terrace.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.176
So what?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.711
What can you tell me
about the kids...

36:20.778 --> 36:21.712
who play competitions
on the tracks?

36:22.914 --> 36:24.415
What kids?

36:24.482 --> 36:27.251
They stand on the tracks
and when the train comes...

36:27.318 --> 36:28.519
they jump off.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.688
That's not true.

36:30.755 --> 36:32.423
It's true.
I saw it.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.659
How could you see it?

36:35.393 --> 36:38.129
Well, I didn't actually saw it.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.398
But I was told about it
by a very reliable source.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.033
The only ones who know
what really happen...

36:42.099 --> 36:44.735
on the tracks are
those who drive the trains.

36:44.802 --> 36:49.173
I can talk
about security at the stations.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.274
Poor working conditions.

36:50.341 --> 36:54.145
Do you know Alberto Lete?
A safety barrier guard.

36:54.679 --> 36:55.713
The one who is in a coma?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.448
Yes, that is right.
He had a labor accident.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.084
He was hit by a train.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.253
We are not talking
about the same person.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.921
The one I am talking about
was run over by a car.

37:03.988 --> 37:04.989
He was drunk.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.857
Yes, we are talking
about the same person.

37:06.924 --> 37:08.859
-I don't understand.
-I don't understand either.

37:10.261 --> 37:11.529
That's why I'm here.

37:11.596 --> 37:12.997
I'd like you
to help me understand.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.667
I can only talk
about the things I know.

37:17.301 --> 37:20.004
The rest is impossible.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.328
Hello,
I'm Verónica Rosenthal.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.030
I missed a call
from this number.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.743
It is the first time I go out.

38:02.146 --> 38:04.915
Why do you think
your husband did it, Sandra?

38:06.350 --> 38:09.287
-He had no way out.
-Why?

38:11.922 --> 38:16.827
I never thought
he'd do such a thing.

38:19.997 --> 38:23.768
Looking back, I think
it'd happen some time.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.271
Do you think the company
was responsible?

38:29.407 --> 38:30.908
I don't know
if they were fully responsible.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.814
But I'm sure
they were somewhat responsible.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.384
He was seeing a therapist.

38:40.451 --> 38:44.755
He was supposed to help him.
Not to end like this.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.163
Someone must be
held responsible.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.832
At least to keep it
from happening again.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.537
That's why you're writing
your article, right?

39:06.577 --> 39:07.678
I have something for you.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.527
-Is this one of your boys?
-No.

39:26.964 --> 39:28.599
It's the kid Alfredo hit.

39:34.805 --> 39:37.141
Alfredo kept his picture.
I don't know why.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.411
-What made you change your mind?
-What do you mean?

39:41.946 --> 39:43.147
At first you didn't want
to talk to me.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.315
But then you called me.

39:44.582 --> 39:46.217
I never said
I wouldn't talk to you.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.687
Not to me, to Lucio.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.089
You told him
you wouldn't talk to me.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.791
Do you know Lucio?

39:54.358 --> 39:57.027
Yes, I asked him
to talk to you.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.663
Lucio never talked to me.

40:00.097 --> 40:02.433
My sister-in-law gave me
your number, not Lucio.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.029
Come on, kid.

40:45.509 --> 40:46.477
Get on.

42:22.339 --> 42:23.440
Well, this is Peque.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.209
And this is Cholito.
You already know him.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.645
You must do your best, kids.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.481
-How much time do we have?
-Five minutes.

42:30.748 --> 42:33.717
Not much.
Listen, Peque.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.253
You'll stand on the tracks
one next to the other.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.789
You can't back out now.
You'll see the train coming.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.992
You stay as much as you can
and then you jump off.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.761
Just for coming here,
you've got 100 pesos.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.396
The winner is the one
who jumps off the last.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.197
That one gets 400 pesos.

42:47.264 --> 42:48.699
It's 500 pesos to spend
on whatever you want.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.134
Good luck.

42:50.834 --> 42:53.938
Stand there.
A step backwards.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.673
Move aside, please.

42:56.373 --> 43:01.779
Now we'll see
who is the strongest.

43:48.525 --> 43:51.195
-You'd better jump off.
-You too.

43:52.262 --> 43:53.964
Have you heard about Jonathan?

43:55.132 --> 43:56.066
He thought he was smart.
Just as you.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.602
And he lost a leg.

43:59.336 --> 44:02.773
I'm not dumb.
I'll be fine.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.577
You'd better jump off.
Listen to me.

44:23.894 --> 44:25.029
Damn!

44:31.468 --> 44:33.137
Jump, asshole.
Come on!

44:57.795 --> 44:58.729
Come in.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.202
-Where shall I put the wine?
-Over there.

45:10.274 --> 45:12.176
I'm having a gin tonic.
Would you like one?

45:12.242 --> 45:13.277
Yes, please.

45:26.423 --> 45:27.357
Stop here.

45:34.398 --> 45:37.167
Get off, Peque.
We'll take Cholito home.

45:38.268 --> 45:40.471
You did it very well.
Here.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.007
You've earned it.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.712
These are peanuts
considering what we do.

45:51.515 --> 45:54.084
We'll talk it over.
All right?

45:54.151 --> 45:56.019
Remember to keep
your mouth shut.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.088
There are lots of crazy people
out there.

45:58.622 --> 46:01.158
If you don't say anything,
you'll make a lot of money.

46:02.426 --> 46:03.627
Go now, champ.

46:57.181 --> 46:59.249
Would you mind leaving?
I have to get up early tomorrow.

47:01.418 --> 47:02.653
-Do you want me to leave?
-Yes.

47:04.388 --> 47:05.889
-Don't you want me to stay?
-No.

47:09.927 --> 47:11.061
Fine.

47:59.710 --> 48:03.213
-Shall we go to bed?
-I am coming.

48:04.982 --> 48:07.417
You can watch TV upstairs.

48:07.484 --> 48:10.187
I don't want to bother you.
Go get some rest.

48:11.788 --> 48:13.357
Don't fall asleep on the couch.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.176
I need you to find
the address for this phone.

50:46.243 --> 50:47.878
I think this is the house
where lives the boy...

50:47.944 --> 50:48.879
that Carranza hit.

50:49.179 --> 50:50.347
Where did you get
the money from?

50:50.714 --> 50:51.948
I can't tell you.

50:52.249 --> 50:53.583
You have a good eye.
You know what I need.

50:54.317 --> 50:55.919
Find me another one like Peque
and I'll help you out.

50:56.820 --> 50:58.021
There you are.

50:59.022 --> 51:00.557
Here is some for you, girls.

51:02.259 --> 51:03.226
How long have you been clean?

51:03.527 --> 51:04.795
Seven months.

51:05.529 --> 51:06.730
Here he is.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.332
Actually, he is not in a coma,
but in a vegetative state.

51:09.633 --> 51:12.702
You don't seem to understand.
There are children involved.

51:12.769 --> 51:13.804
And you have children, Lucio.

51:13.870 --> 51:15.138
I want more money.

51:15.205 --> 51:17.174
-Last time you gave me peanuts.
-Come on!

51:17.674 --> 51:20.377
I saw many people there.
At least, 2,000 pesos.

51:20.444 --> 51:21.778
Do you know how much is that?

51:21.845 --> 51:23.380
There is no competition then.

51:23.447 --> 51:25.816
-You know what happened.
-Yes, but I need to know more.

51:31.488 --> 51:32.389
Get her!
