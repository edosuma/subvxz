00:01.766 --> 00:04.285
Previously on Magnum P.I...

00:04.359 --> 00:07.288
My one redeeming quality
in this life is that I've always

00:07.313 --> 00:09.079
tried to be a father figure to you.

00:09.148 --> 00:10.747
Man, I was surprised when you called.

00:10.816 --> 00:12.416
I didn't think you were up for parole

00:12.485 --> 00:14.184
for another 18 months.

00:14.253 --> 00:15.853
You'd be surprised how far

00:15.950 --> 00:18.917
a charming personality will take you.

00:18.958 --> 00:21.158
- How long?
- Couple of months.

00:21.227 --> 00:23.193
Doc says it's stage IV cancer.

00:23.262 --> 00:27.397
I'm gonna enjoy every bit
of life I got left with you.

00:28.610 --> 00:30.601
- My visa's expired.
- What are you gonna do about it?

00:30.669 --> 00:33.005
Well, I have an immigration
lawyer who's working on it.

00:33.079 --> 00:34.771
Well, you know, you can always
overstay your visa.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.307
- You have 180 days.
- Yeah.

00:37.376 --> 00:40.410
And 171 days ago,
that might have been an option.

00:40.479 --> 00:42.446
Everything okay? My immigration lawyer.

00:42.515 --> 00:45.442
He filed an emergency appeal,
but it was denied.

00:45.499 --> 00:47.718
And, 'cause I overstayed so long,

00:47.786 --> 00:49.553
there is a chance that
they'll deny me entirely.

00:49.622 --> 00:52.623
Which means I'll be
moving back to London.

01:20.619 --> 01:23.086
Magnum!

01:45.065 --> 01:46.910
_

01:47.645 --> 01:50.180
Easy. Easy.

01:50.249 --> 01:52.849
Okay, s-steady, boys.

01:52.918 --> 01:53.951
Steady.

01:54.019 --> 01:55.953
Steady.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.287
No, no, no, Magnum,
you're doing it all wrong.

01:57.356 --> 01:58.589
How can I be doing it wrong?

01:58.657 --> 01:59.957
I-I haven't even done anything.

02:00.025 --> 02:03.360
Dogs have a pack mentality,
Magnum, right?

02:03.429 --> 02:05.762
In every pack, there is an alpha.

02:05.831 --> 02:07.130
The alpha has the first

02:07.199 --> 02:08.966
and the last say;
you need to be commanding

02:09.033 --> 02:11.101
and lose all the emotion from your voice.

02:11.170 --> 02:12.288
- Right?
- Okay.

02:12.339 --> 02:14.071
Whatever you say, Master Yoda.

02:14.139 --> 02:15.973
Sorry, I-I don't get the reference.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.441
Not a Star Trek fan.

02:17.509 --> 02:20.844
Star Trek? You got be kidding me.

02:20.913 --> 02:22.145
Yes. Of course I'm kidding you.

02:22.214 --> 02:23.747
That was a test, which you failed

02:23.816 --> 02:25.482
because you're still being too emotional.

02:25.551 --> 02:28.218
Now be... the... alpha.

02:28.287 --> 02:29.620
Okay.

02:30.623 --> 02:32.956
- Apollo.
- Magnum,

02:33.025 --> 02:34.124
that is Zeus.

02:34.193 --> 02:35.292
Surely, you can tell them apart.

02:35.361 --> 02:36.660
Of course I can't.

02:36.729 --> 02:38.362
What did I say about being too emotional?

02:38.430 --> 02:40.998
Okay, okay, okay.

02:41.066 --> 02:43.367
Zeus... sit.

02:43.435 --> 02:45.335
- No, too late.
- Okay.

02:45.404 --> 02:46.970
Ea-Easy, boys, easy. Heel!
They sense your indecisiveness.

02:47.039 --> 02:48.071
Heel.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.207
Okay, which is it, Magnum?
Is it sit or is it heel?

02:50.275 --> 02:51.642
Do they even know the difference?

02:51.710 --> 02:53.043
Do you?

02:54.346 --> 02:56.480
And don't roll your eyes, Magnum.

02:56.548 --> 02:58.181
How can you even see that
from over there?

02:58.250 --> 03:00.917
I don't need to see it, Magnum.
I know you. Now focus.

03:00.986 --> 03:03.320
I need to know
that you can look after the lads

03:03.389 --> 03:04.614
whilst I'm in London.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.256
Okay, you know what?

03:06.325 --> 03:08.025
Listen to me, you two maniacs.

03:08.093 --> 03:09.326
I've had enough of this crap, all right?

03:09.395 --> 03:11.294
I am tired of you guys terrorizing me.

03:11.363 --> 03:12.396
All right? I'm the alpha.

03:12.464 --> 03:13.697
I'm the alpha,

03:13.766 --> 03:15.198
and you're gonna do exactly as I say.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.367
And right now,
I command the both of you...

03:17.436 --> 03:18.602
to sit!

03:23.208 --> 03:24.675
It worked.

03:29.381 --> 03:31.481
Oh, my God.

03:31.550 --> 03:32.916
Higgins!

03:41.877 --> 03:44.061
Hold on. You met a
woman in the cancer ward?

03:44.129 --> 03:45.762
Not just a woman, Teddy.

03:46.145 --> 03:47.444
An angel.

03:47.513 --> 03:49.346
Look at you, you old hound dog.

03:49.415 --> 03:50.714
How did this happen?

03:50.783 --> 03:52.750
I don't know. We were just
the only two patients

03:52.818 --> 03:54.885
not distracted by our cell
phones, so we started talking,

03:54.954 --> 03:57.654
and two hours later,
we're still at it, and ended up

03:57.723 --> 03:59.556
grabbing a bite in the cafÃ© downstairs.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.724
Wow. That's amazing.

04:00.793 --> 04:02.766
Yeah, we got plans for next week.

04:03.629 --> 04:05.509
We are going skydiving.

04:05.574 --> 04:07.364
Ha! Ooh!

04:07.433 --> 04:08.665
Hold on, hold on.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.134
You realize how dangerous that is?

04:10.202 --> 04:11.735
Oh, how dangerous can it be?
What's the worst

04:11.804 --> 04:13.404
that can happen, man...
my chute doesn't open?

04:13.472 --> 04:14.905
I'm dying

04:14.974 --> 04:16.473
of terminal cancer, boys.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.575
I'm checking out either way.

04:18.644 --> 04:20.144
Ice, that is not funny.

04:20.212 --> 04:21.978
All right, I'll-I'll be right back.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.781
I got to hit the head.

04:25.551 --> 04:28.218
You know, I know
the odds aren't great, but...

04:28.287 --> 04:29.987
I'm glad he decided to fight this thing.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.420
Yeah.

04:34.126 --> 04:35.459
What are you doing?

04:35.528 --> 04:36.593
Just a little digging.

04:36.662 --> 04:38.028
Ice has been acting weird lately.

04:38.097 --> 04:39.496
Plus, he's never had a cell.

04:39.565 --> 04:40.731
A cell phone?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.859
Now, that is suspicious.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.850
Don't mock me, all right?
I can tell something's up.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.752
Ice never has had a cell phone,

04:46.821 --> 04:49.104
even when most guys in prison
had burners.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.354
Hmm.

04:51.607 --> 04:53.767
- What is it?
- It's a text chain

04:53.854 --> 04:56.054
with some number I don't recognize.

04:56.119 --> 04:58.197
Ice is meeting up with somebody tonight.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.098
Well, it's probably the woman
he was just talking about.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.901
Nah, not the way they're
texting. This is a guy.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.436
Ice could be up to something.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.938
He's probably just meeting up
with some dude

05:06.006 --> 05:07.105
to hang out.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.748
Kind of like we're doing right now.

05:09.823 --> 05:11.043
Yeah.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.044
Ooh, yeah.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.314
Everything good?

05:15.923 --> 05:17.583
Yeah. You ready for another Coops?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.284
Yes, sir. I gotcha, buddy.

06:05.199 --> 06:08.133
Well, this doesn't look
suspicious at all.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.449
What the hell you doing here?

06:09.502 --> 06:10.969
You know, I could ask the same
of you, pal.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.071
How'd you find me? I made
sure I wasn't followed.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.607
I put Friend Finder on
your phone at the bar earlier.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.709
Friend what? What-what the hell is that?

06:17.778 --> 06:20.612
It's an app. You can track your
friends' movements, you know,

06:20.681 --> 06:22.314
in case they decide
to do something stupid.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.182
Now it's your turn. What's going on?

06:26.099 --> 06:27.159
A score.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.855
I'm hitting up a warehouse
over at Pearl City with a guy.

06:29.924 --> 06:32.090
- You out of your mind?
- Look, it's an easy pinch, man.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.825
I'll be in and out in under 20.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.727
Nobody gets hurt. It's a no-brainer.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.663
You just got out. You want to go back in?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.270
This is none of your business, kid.

06:39.346 --> 06:41.300
You're family...
that makes it my business.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.869
Rick, I love you, man, I do,
but I'm doing this thing.

06:43.938 --> 06:46.638
So you either turn me in,
or you get in that car,

06:46.707 --> 06:49.041
you drive away... only two options here.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.413
Okay.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.949
Give me a hug first, just in case.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.050
All right.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.651
Come on, man. All cool.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.620
All right. Be safe, okay?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.021
Always.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.498
Very smooth, kid.

07:14.043 --> 07:15.233
Learned from the best.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.768
Give 'em back.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.503
Eh, you know I can't do that.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.638
Knock it off, Rick.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.039
I'm already late as is.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.175
Why? Just tell me that. Why?

07:25.802 --> 07:27.145
I got this friend,

07:27.666 --> 07:29.348
he needs somebody to hold his hand.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.515
So why has it got to be you?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.717
Guy had my back in prison.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.225
Ice, you're a 63-year-old man
with lung cancer.

07:34.283 --> 07:35.721
You haven't had a score since the '90s.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.255
You're gonna get caught.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.590
I know what I'm doing.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.025
Ice, it's taken me long enough

07:40.094 --> 07:41.727
to accept the fact that you're sick.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.195
All right? The only way I can cope

07:43.263 --> 07:45.597
is by enjoying the time
that we still have left.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.100
So hell no, you're not getting
these keys back.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.274
Damn you, kid.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.244
All right.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.879
All right, what?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.581
All right, you win.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.084
You're a stubborn
son of a bitch, you know that?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.053
I learned that from you, too.

08:08.122 --> 08:10.255
Come on, I'll give you a lift home.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.260
It's gonna look bad,
me backing out like this.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.962
Come on. You're Icepick.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.697
You're a legend.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.600
Your reputation can take a hit.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.802
Yeah.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.852
I've been working
every angle I can think of

08:40.921 --> 08:43.054
to keep Higgins in Hawaii,
but time's running out.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.624
A few days from now,
she'll be on a plane to London.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.559
She says she'll be back, but who knows?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.628
Could take a while
for this whole visa thing

08:49.696 --> 08:50.829
to get sorted out.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.531
A lot can happen between now and then.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.865
Maybe she'll change her mind,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.934
decide London is where she ought to be.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.302
Maybe she'll meet someone.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.904
One thing seems certain, though:

08:58.972 --> 09:00.672
it looks like I'll be without a partner

09:00.741 --> 09:02.674
for the foreseeable future.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.444
On the plus side, I'm getting
two dogs that hate me.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.415
Thomas Magnum.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.357
Hey. It's Adam Noshimuri with Five-O.

09:12.402 --> 09:13.858
Tani Rey gave me your number.

09:13.913 --> 09:15.687
Yeah. Thanks for getting back to me.

09:15.754 --> 09:16.721
Of course.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.942
Tani fill you in?

09:18.001 --> 09:19.438
She did. And I reached out

09:19.480 --> 09:20.892
to an immigration attorney I know.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.708
He's hooked up a few yakuza
with legit papers.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.664
He says there might be one option,

09:25.732 --> 09:28.600
but it's a long shot and very expensive.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.601
Legal?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.089
As far as I know.

09:31.145 --> 09:32.337
He didn't get into details.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.273
Look, I'll text you his contact
info so you can follow up.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.175
Great. Yeah, much appreciated.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.010
No problem. Hope it works out.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.645
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.615
An expensive long shot.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.084
Doesn't sound very encouraging,
but it's something.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.686
Gonna need some help, though.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.122
Good thing I know someone
with deep pockets.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.923
Hey, Robin.

09:52.632 --> 09:54.025
It's me.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.036
Ice?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.539
Ice?

10:08.542 --> 10:10.775
Ice, I know you're in there. Come on.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.577
We got to talk!

10:14.073 --> 10:15.606
Ice, I'm coming in.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.519
Ice?

10:21.722 --> 10:22.754
Ice!

10:23.924 --> 10:25.056
Oh, man.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.258
Hey, kid.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.693
You lied to me... you went
through with it anyway.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.228
Yeah, I should've listened to you, man.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.596
The whole thing went sideways.

10:31.665 --> 10:32.998
Yeah, no kidding. It's all over the news.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.799
They're saying you guys
killed a security guard.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.636
Not me. No, man, not me.
My-my... my partner.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.604
- You know he was gonna do that?
- No, of course not!

10:39.673 --> 10:42.027
Son of a bitch popped the guard,
then turned the gun on me

10:42.101 --> 10:43.808
before splitting with the cash.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.877
- I was lucky to get away.
- That looks bad.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.180
- I got to get you to the hospital.
- No. No, no hospitals.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.315
- You're gonna bleed out.
- Then let it bleed out.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.483
I'm getting your ass to the hospital,

10:51.552 --> 10:52.651
you're gonna tell the cops what you know.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.252
Ricky, Ricky, forget it!

10:54.321 --> 10:55.720
You were there.
You know who the killer is.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.088
I'm not turning myself in.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.324
I didn't kill nobody
and I didn't steal nothing.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.259
Ice, you got to do something.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.062
I am not gonna spend what time
I got left in a cage.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.198
Besides, I tell Five-O everything I know,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.083
you're gonna end up there with me.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.380
What happened? Whose blood is that?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.282
- Icepick's.
- Is he okay?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.450
He's alive.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.252
Listen, I-I need your help.

11:27.321 --> 11:28.920
You heard about that
warehouse that got hit

11:28.989 --> 11:30.222
in Pearl City last night?

11:31.057 --> 11:32.956
Yeah, I-I saw it on the news.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.626
Icepick was there.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.462
Well, you got to tell HPD.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.563
I can't.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.899
Rick, someone died last night.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.167
I know you guys are family,
but this is...

11:43.257 --> 11:44.569
Magnum, it's about more than that.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.404
Look,

11:46.429 --> 11:48.796
I knew it was going down.
I saw Icepick last night.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.843
So you knew about it,
and you didn't do anything?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.845
No, I got in his face,
I told him he couldn't do it.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.647
I told him to turn around and walk away.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.849
Hell, I thought he did.
I gave him a ride home.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.151
- And he still went through with it?
- Yeah.

12:00.235 --> 12:02.847
You were with him last night,
you had advance knowledge of it.

12:02.912 --> 12:04.856
Considering your relationship,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.157
they're gonna think you were involved.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.993
That's why I'm here.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.262
If I go to the cops,
we could both end up in prison.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.496
But there's a killer on the loose.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.998
Somebody's got to catch him.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.707
And I'm sorry to put you guys
in this position,

12:15.792 --> 12:18.136
but I don't know who else to turn to.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.373
Look, Thomas, I need your help.

12:34.297 --> 12:35.997
Sorry about the blood.

12:36.565 --> 12:39.393
There's some pain medication in
the cabinet next to the fridge.

12:39.455 --> 12:40.901
I didn't want to come here.

12:40.970 --> 12:42.369
Rick insisted on it.

12:42.438 --> 12:43.537
It's just as well he did.

12:44.518 --> 12:45.884
Tell us about your partner.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.742
His name is Adrian Reese.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.911
We were in Halawa together.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.480
He was getting out,
he had a score lined up,

12:53.549 --> 12:54.648
wanted to pick my brain about it.

12:54.717 --> 12:56.383
I figure, "I ain't going anywhere, so..."

12:56.452 --> 12:57.751
So you gave him your take on it.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.055
For a roll of commissary stamps
and a pack of smokes, yeah.

13:01.123 --> 13:04.525
But then, I got out early, and

13:04.593 --> 13:06.493
I figured, "What the hell?
I'll hit up Reese,

13:06.562 --> 13:08.929
and maybe he wants some company."

13:08.998 --> 13:10.352
Where do we find this guy?

13:12.968 --> 13:14.568
I wouldn't know.

13:14.637 --> 13:16.070
Is there any information
you could give us?

13:16.138 --> 13:17.905
Any detail that might help?

13:18.941 --> 13:20.174
No.

13:20.242 --> 13:21.608
Come on, there's got to be something.

13:21.677 --> 13:22.960
Ice, think.

13:23.032 --> 13:24.679
There's a guy lying dead
in the morgue because of us.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.113
What are you talking about,
"Because of us"?

13:26.182 --> 13:27.414
I didn't see you there.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.972
I should've stopped you. Come on, Rick.

13:28.997 --> 13:30.303
You know you had nothing to do with this.

13:30.335 --> 13:32.625
No, I should've stayed with him,
made sure he didn't go back.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.323
Instead, I trusted you.

13:36.348 --> 13:40.250
Yeah, well, then you didn't
learn what I taught you, kid.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.963
- What's that?
- Never trust a crook.

13:43.032 --> 13:44.565
Yo.

13:44.633 --> 13:45.966
Yo, I got your message.

13:46.035 --> 13:48.135
You all right? Yeah, I'm fine.

13:48.204 --> 13:51.071
All right, anything you need, I got you.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.040
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:53.109 --> 13:54.808
- Thanks, TC.
- I'm here for him.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.276
If you didn't have a hole in you,

13:56.345 --> 13:57.811
the two of us would be having words.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.402
You're a good friend.

13:59.427 --> 14:00.659
Like you should've been?

14:00.816 --> 14:02.216
Look, my boy could go down

14:02.284 --> 14:04.151
- because of what you did.
- All right, TC, just...

14:04.220 --> 14:05.586
take a breath.

14:05.654 --> 14:07.120
No, he's right.

14:07.144 --> 14:09.286
I got myself into this.

14:10.226 --> 14:11.816
I'm the one who's got to make it right.

14:11.841 --> 14:13.216
Where do you think you're going?

14:13.241 --> 14:14.507
To find Reese.

14:15.209 --> 14:16.964
Yeah, that's not happening.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.233
Magnum's right.
You're in no fit state to go anywhere.

14:19.301 --> 14:20.634
You need to stay here

14:20.659 --> 14:22.257
till you get your strength back.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.072
Let us do our job.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.679
What's this about?

14:32.704 --> 14:34.571
Our client thinks this guy Reese
might be the father

14:34.596 --> 14:38.231
of her child, so we need
to find him and collect DNA.

14:38.431 --> 14:40.364
Well, you need a court order for that,

14:40.389 --> 14:41.989
unless you plan to raid
his trash in search

14:42.057 --> 14:44.379
of a half-eaten sandwich
or some used dental floss.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.294
Right now, we're just focused
on, uh, tracking him down.

14:47.363 --> 14:48.996
He's gone off grid.

14:51.567 --> 14:54.301
I can let you look at the file,
but you can't take it with you.

14:54.370 --> 14:55.958
Deal.

15:01.377 --> 15:03.677
Here he is.

15:03.746 --> 15:05.746
All right. Thanks.

15:07.383 --> 15:10.350
Hey, listen, I just want to say
I'm sorry to see you go,

15:10.419 --> 15:12.219
but I think you made the right decision.

15:12.288 --> 15:13.387
I appreciate that.

15:13.457 --> 15:15.722
I hope this one doesn't give you
too much grief while I'm gone.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.790
Heard that.

15:16.859 --> 15:18.225
Let me know when you get settled.

15:18.294 --> 15:20.367
I'm thinking about taking my son
to Europe for summer vacation.

15:20.413 --> 15:22.066
- Maybe we'll look you up.
- Oh, yeah,

15:22.107 --> 15:24.787
you absolutely have to.
I'd love to show you around.

15:24.812 --> 15:28.047
Okay. It looks like our guy
Reese has a bunch of aliases.

15:28.204 --> 15:30.537
Okay, well, that's a good place to start.

15:30.606 --> 15:33.173
All right. Thanks, Gordon. Owe you one.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.218
Just one?

15:34.243 --> 15:36.910
Cheerio.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.150
Hey, when you're back
in London, you don't mind

15:43.219 --> 15:45.919
if I ask you to do stuff
like this for me, right?

15:45.988 --> 15:48.855
Hmm. If I said I would mind,
would it stop you?

15:49.428 --> 15:50.591
Probably not.

15:51.109 --> 15:53.427
And besides, I figure
it's the least you can do,

15:53.495 --> 15:56.763
considering you're kind of
bailing on our partnership.

15:57.436 --> 16:00.500
I'm sorry, but that is not my choice.

16:00.569 --> 16:02.869
Is that why you've been
avoiding me this whole time?

16:02.938 --> 16:05.339
- 'Cause you think I'm abandoning you?
- I'm not avoiding you.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.007
You've been on the surf ski
three times a day

16:07.076 --> 16:08.426
since I told you I was leaving.

16:08.530 --> 16:09.785
Well, I like to surf-ski.

16:09.809 --> 16:11.278
No one likes paddling that much, Magnum.

16:16.258 --> 16:18.192
Okay, I take it back.

16:18.546 --> 16:21.210
You're not bailing on me. I just, um...

16:23.331 --> 16:25.532
I'm disappointed that you're leaving.

16:27.630 --> 16:29.176
So am I.

16:31.859 --> 16:33.125
Hey.

16:33.357 --> 16:34.635
Anything yet?

16:34.703 --> 16:35.802
We're working on it.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.291
How's Mr. Hofstetler?

16:37.316 --> 16:38.661
He's, uh... he's sleeping.

16:41.663 --> 16:42.862
What's going on?

16:42.887 --> 16:44.286
Robin's coming to Hawaii.

16:44.513 --> 16:46.647
I told him it wasn't necessary,
that we could

16:46.672 --> 16:49.039
deal with the particulars
of my exit over the phone.

16:50.786 --> 16:52.819
I-I don't think that's it.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.154
What do you mean?

16:55.550 --> 16:57.417
Well, I talked to a guy
from Five-O, and he said

16:57.442 --> 16:59.876
he may know a lawyer
who can help out with this,

16:59.901 --> 17:02.168
but it-it's very expensive,

17:02.351 --> 17:03.951
so I asked Robin to look into it.

17:04.199 --> 17:05.565
I wish you hadn't done that.

17:05.634 --> 17:06.767
Why not?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.791
Because Robin's
already done so much for me.

17:08.817 --> 17:11.251
Yeah, you didn't ask
him to do anything. I did. And besides,

17:11.276 --> 17:12.340
it's a long shot.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.165
Uh, almost zero percent chance

17:14.191 --> 17:15.722
that it's gonna work.

17:16.512 --> 17:17.778
What is it?

17:17.846 --> 17:20.781
I don't know, but Robin said that, um,

17:20.848 --> 17:23.183
if it doesn't work, he still
wanted to say goodbye.

17:24.653 --> 17:26.252
That's very thoughtful of him.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.145
Yeah, well, that's Robin.

17:30.693 --> 17:32.292
You know, I'd like to throw you a party

17:32.317 --> 17:33.549
before you go. Uh,

17:33.574 --> 17:34.940
assuming I'm not in jail.

17:35.336 --> 17:37.269
- Thank you, Rick.
- Yeah.

17:40.169 --> 17:41.501
Why don't you go home,

17:41.570 --> 17:44.171
take a shower
and maybe check in on the bar?

17:44.239 --> 17:46.273
Uh, no, I'm-I'm okay. I'll stick around.

17:46.342 --> 17:47.741
Rick, seriously,
go take care of yourself.

17:47.810 --> 17:48.942
We've got this.

17:50.446 --> 17:53.413
All right. Well, uh,
call me if you find Reese.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.267
I feel bad for him.

18:01.089 --> 18:03.022
Shouldering the weight of this problem.

18:03.225 --> 18:04.825
He shouldn't blame himself.

18:04.893 --> 18:07.608
I don't think it's that.
I-I just think he feels like...

18:08.764 --> 18:10.127
Icepick betrayed him.

18:10.152 --> 18:11.819
Well, he's not wrong.
I mean, if it were me,

18:11.844 --> 18:13.677
I don't know that I would protect him.

18:13.869 --> 18:15.302
Yeah, I don't think I would, either.

18:15.371 --> 18:17.537
But it's complicated.
I mean, without Icepick,

18:17.606 --> 18:21.074
Rick probably would've ended up
on a very different path.

18:21.663 --> 18:23.377
Rick feels like he owes him.

18:23.445 --> 18:25.085
Yeah.

18:26.482 --> 18:28.141
Oh. I have something.

18:28.206 --> 18:29.916
Reese used one of his aliases

18:29.985 --> 18:31.752
to check into the Honua Lani Inn.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.175
Then let's head over there.

18:40.496 --> 18:41.495
But, uh...

18:41.563 --> 18:43.363
But, um, this is the picture of the guy.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.400
216.

18:46.468 --> 18:48.802
Promise me you won't use
that fake badge when I'm gone.

18:48.871 --> 18:51.037
This little piece of tin
opens a lot of doors, okay?

18:51.106 --> 18:52.205
So that's a no?

18:52.274 --> 18:54.174
It-it helps me do my job.
Asking me not to use it

18:54.243 --> 18:57.150
is like asking Steph Curry
not to use his jump shot. A jump shot...

18:57.220 --> 18:59.379
Yeah, we have basketball
in England, Magnum.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.314
The door's been busted open.

19:13.495 --> 19:14.961
Mr. Hofstetler.

19:15.439 --> 19:16.863
He ain't here.

19:16.932 --> 19:19.032
We must've just missed him.

19:19.101 --> 19:20.333
You lied to us.

19:20.402 --> 19:22.302
Yeah, well, I didn't
want you more involved

19:22.371 --> 19:23.603
than you already are.

19:23.672 --> 19:26.106
So you were just gonna execute
a man in cold blood?

19:26.175 --> 19:28.275
He didn't hesitate to pull
the trigger on that guard.

19:28.343 --> 19:29.776
Last night could've been a clean score,

19:29.845 --> 19:31.077
but that wasn't good enough for Reese.

19:31.146 --> 19:33.280
No, no, he wanted
to have it all for himself,

19:33.348 --> 19:35.282
and he didn't want
to leave any witnesses.

19:35.671 --> 19:38.452
20 years ago, I never would've
trusted a guy like that.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.575
Because I did...

19:41.723 --> 19:44.224
you're all in a fix now.

19:44.359 --> 19:45.992
Maybe you can still do some good.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.228
Tell us what you know
about Reese so we can find him.

19:49.798 --> 19:50.876
Yeah, then what?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.105
Then we turn him in.

19:52.130 --> 19:54.023
Figure out some way to keep you
and Rick out of this.

19:54.048 --> 19:55.581
Man, you don't get it.

19:55.606 --> 19:58.207
I don't want to put him back behind bars.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.507
I want someone
to stick him in the ground.

20:01.571 --> 20:03.510
It's the only way
you stop a man like that.

20:04.099 --> 20:05.479
He's evil.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.271
Even if you are right,

20:10.224 --> 20:12.190
that's not what Rick wants us to do.

20:19.228 --> 20:21.064
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?

20:21.119 --> 20:23.004
There was a guy in here looking for you.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.510
- Who?
- He didn't leave his name.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.288
He's sitting in the booth over there.

20:27.569 --> 20:29.416
All right, thanks.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.780
Funny. I've been looking for you.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.082
Walk.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.932
- Walk.
- All right.

20:47.022 --> 20:48.155
Where's the car?

20:48.222 --> 20:49.863
Take it easy. It's the Porsche.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.157
Good. Let's go for a ride.

20:51.226 --> 20:52.692
Okay. Where do you want to go?

20:52.761 --> 20:54.294
You're gonna take me
to Icepick. Let's go.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.515
If he moves off that sofa,

21:25.584 --> 21:27.350
- shoot him.
- You got it.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.245
Rick.

21:38.063 --> 21:40.063
Okay. We're on our way.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.653
We got to go.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.707
Okay, I know it doesn't look like it,

21:50.776 --> 21:52.776
but I swear I got in
some pretty good shots.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.045
- Yeah, sure, you did.
- I did, seriously.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.948
- And I believe you.
- It doesn't sound like you do, Theodore.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.382
Guys, please.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.618
What did he want?

22:01.687 --> 22:03.520
He wanted to finish
what he started with Ice.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.942
Yeah, dude must've
seen coverage of the robbery,

22:05.994 --> 22:08.658
heard that there was only
one dead body instead of two,

22:08.727 --> 22:09.760
knew he messed up.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.367
Yeah, well, if he's hunting Icepick,

22:11.434 --> 22:13.396
it's only a matter of time
before he finds him.

22:13.465 --> 22:15.165
I'm more concerned
about you at the moment.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.306
I'm gonna be fine.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.567
Maybe now you are.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.336
But Reese knows that
you can link him to that heist.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.670
He's gonna want you dead, too.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.372
Ah, he's got the money. If he was smart,

22:22.441 --> 22:24.074
he'd get off this rock
while he still can.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.543
If he was gonna do that,
he would've done that yesterday.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.879
Think he's more concerned
with tying up loose ends.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.347
You sure?

22:30.415 --> 22:31.815
It sounds risky.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.717
I guess it's better
than looking over your shoulder

22:33.786 --> 22:34.818
for the rest of your life.

22:34.887 --> 22:35.819
We don't have a choice.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.053
We have to bring the fight to Reese.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.922
We have to find him and take him down

22:38.991 --> 22:40.390
before he gets to Rick and Icepick.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.525
You guys got any leads?

22:41.593 --> 22:43.193
None of Reese's other aliases

22:43.262 --> 22:45.629
from HPD panned out,
but Icepick did mention

22:45.697 --> 22:47.497
another name he's been using.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.832
Carl Brewer.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.033
We're looking into it now.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.601
All right, well, I'm
staying here with Orville

22:51.670 --> 22:52.769
until this whole thing's over.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.104
I don't need a bodyguard.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.939
- I'm staying.
- He's staying.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.784
I don't know you too well,

23:07.853 --> 23:09.619
but the way you're looking at me,

23:09.688 --> 23:12.355
feels like you might
want to use that thing.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.925
Believe me, I'm tempted.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.295
No one was supposed to get killed.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.863
Given your experience,

23:19.932 --> 23:22.532
you had to know
that was still a possibility.

23:22.601 --> 23:25.202
I've been on the inside for a long time.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.738
Being on the prowl...
that's... it's what I do.

23:29.260 --> 23:31.775
I couldn't resist one last score.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.412
I really didn't want anyone to get hurt.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.746
Uh-huh.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.248
What about Rick?

23:39.061 --> 23:40.283
What about him?

23:40.352 --> 23:41.618
He's like your son.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.453
You're supposed to protect him.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.788
I always have.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.423
Best I could.

23:46.491 --> 23:47.924
Until now.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.060
You put him
and everyone I love in danger.

23:50.128 --> 23:51.661
And for what? Money?

23:52.032 --> 23:54.130
You only care about yourself.

23:54.535 --> 23:56.036
Should be ashamed.

23:56.954 --> 23:58.468
I am.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.138
Wasn't about the money, though.

24:02.543 --> 24:04.207
Then why'd you do it?

24:05.244 --> 24:07.310
I haven't got that long left.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.145
I just wanted to

24:09.170 --> 24:12.471
feel like... it used to.

24:12.584 --> 24:16.052
I needed something
to make me feel alive again.

24:16.724 --> 24:18.855
Really, really alive.

24:19.351 --> 24:21.625
If only for just one night.

24:22.661 --> 24:25.729
Figure what have I got left to lose?

24:27.443 --> 24:28.903
You had Rick.

24:29.945 --> 24:31.739
Wasn't that enough?

24:36.247 --> 24:37.995
It should've been.

24:44.850 --> 24:48.785
I guess I've been lying
to myself about being at peace.

24:49.465 --> 24:51.121
Truth is...

24:53.469 --> 24:56.459
...I'm not ready to die just yet.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.671
- Anything on Carl Brewer?
- Yeah.

25:07.739 --> 25:11.308
Reese actually used that alias
to get a cellular data plan.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.143
Oh, okay. Score one for Icepick.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.011
- Mm-hmm.
- Ping the phone yet?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.480
Why is it, everything that comes
out of your mouth is a query?

25:17.549 --> 25:19.482
What? I'm driving. You're laptop-ing.

25:19.963 --> 25:21.363
Laptop-ing?

25:21.987 --> 25:23.320
It's just not my thing.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.821
Firstly, "laptop-ing" is not a word.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.590
And secondly, you really ought
to make it your thing, Magnum,

25:27.659 --> 25:29.392
if you're gonna continue
your business without me.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.194
Well, maybe you can teach me
before you leave.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.163
I have days, Magnum, not months.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.198
And as to your query, I can't ping

25:35.267 --> 25:37.000
Mr. Brewer's cell phone
because it's dead.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.135
But according to his cell phone records,

25:39.204 --> 25:40.737
he did call one number

25:40.806 --> 25:43.773
more frequently than most,
and that belongs to a...

25:43.842 --> 25:45.342
Leon Yates.

25:45.813 --> 25:47.344
Leon Yates.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.245
Name sounds familiar.

25:49.314 --> 25:50.859
Could you pull up the news coverage

25:50.883 --> 25:52.404
- from the robbery?
- Uh-huh.

25:57.203 --> 25:58.212
Leon Yates

25:58.237 --> 25:59.889
was the armed guard
who was killed during the heist.

26:00.703 --> 26:03.126
Seems he wasn't such
an innocent victim after all.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.961
No, he's more like an inside man.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.296
Which would explain how Reese knew

26:06.365 --> 26:08.565
that there was a safe
full of cash in the warehouse.

26:08.633 --> 26:09.966
Yates have any family?

26:10.035 --> 26:11.701
Says here he was survived
by a girlfriend...

26:11.770 --> 26:13.370
Cynthia Lloyd in Kalihi.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.109
Maybe she knows something.

26:37.162 --> 26:38.294
Ms. Lloyd?

26:38.363 --> 26:39.829
Yes?

26:39.898 --> 26:41.998
I'm Jan Hawks. This is Travis McCoy.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.700
We're investigating the warehouse robbery

26:43.769 --> 26:46.169
on behalf of its insurance company.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.937
We're very sorry for your loss.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.205
We heard your boyfriend Leon

26:49.274 --> 26:51.140
was a very dedicated security guard.

26:51.237 --> 26:52.776
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

26:52.844 --> 26:54.310
Do we have to do this now?

26:54.798 --> 26:57.080
We understand
it's a difficult time for you.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.848
Generally, in these circumstances,

26:58.917 --> 27:00.583
it's better to move quickly.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.318
We'll only take a minute.

27:05.724 --> 27:06.923
Thank you.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.059
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.294
I, um...

27:11.363 --> 27:13.296
I just don't know how I can help.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.832
For starters, you can tell us

27:15.857 --> 27:18.464
if you recognize this man.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.574
- No. I've never seen him before.
- Okay.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.611
So, you, uh... you live here alone, huh?

27:28.680 --> 27:30.125
Just me.

27:33.295 --> 27:35.852
This is, um, you and Leon, huh?

27:35.921 --> 27:37.153
Looks like

27:37.222 --> 27:38.755
Wailua Falls.

27:39.259 --> 27:40.523
Last Christmas.

27:46.141 --> 27:47.330
Thank for your time.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.467
We're very, uh...
very sorry for your loss. Jan.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.535
We'll call you if we
have any more questions.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.937
Our sincere condolences.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.738
Can't let you leave just yet.

28:05.769 --> 28:06.901
Lock the door.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.935
Look... we mean no disrespect.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.393
We're just working for our clients.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.028
Clients, right.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.362
Friends of Rick.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.198
Looked him up online.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.533
Saw a press conference, you guys
got back from the sandbox

28:23.602 --> 28:24.568
few years ago.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.969
P.O.W. heroes.

28:27.722 --> 28:30.107
Okay. You got me.

28:31.184 --> 28:33.743
But this doesn't
look like a hostage situation.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.246
On a hunch, I'd say these two

28:36.315 --> 28:38.548
had something going on
behind Leon's back.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.351
So, what, you use Leon,

28:41.420 --> 28:43.720
stab him in the back,
and then steal his girl?

28:43.789 --> 28:46.089
Not in that order, but yeah.

28:47.659 --> 28:48.772
What do you want?

28:48.812 --> 28:50.360
You're gonna call your buddy.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.630
You're gonna bring him and the
old man down here, and if you don't,

28:53.699 --> 28:56.066
it's lights-out
for old Mary Poppins here.

29:02.674 --> 29:03.693
Thomas, what's up?

29:03.756 --> 29:05.942
Good news. We got a lead on Reese.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.244
Yes. I love you guys.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.745
Seriously, mai tais for life.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.406
Or any other beverage of your choosing.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.581
What's wrong with mai tais?

29:11.650 --> 29:13.917
I'm just saying it's not your
best cocktail, that's all.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.252
And you're just now telling me this?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.486
Eh, Kammy said it, too.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.721
- Kammy said it?
- Rick, listen,

29:17.789 --> 29:19.122
I think we have a way to draw him out,

29:19.191 --> 29:20.437
but we're gonna need Icepick's help.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.625
Do you think he's up for it?

29:21.693 --> 29:23.426
Yeah,
of course. Anything to get this guy.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.061
Okay, uh, great.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.330
I'm gonna need you to be my QRF,
just like in the Korengal.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.665
But, uh...

29:28.734 --> 29:30.167
I'll shoot you the address in a second.

29:30.235 --> 29:33.329
- Yeah. Yeah, you got it.
- All right. Thanks.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.941
- That was weird.
- Right?

29:38.010 --> 29:40.911
QRF? We were his primary unit.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.246
Yeah, and we didn't have
a QRF in the Korengal.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.981
That's the whole reason
the Talis were able to grab us

29:45.050 --> 29:46.456
when Hannah sold us out.

29:46.530 --> 29:48.585
Thomas is sending us a message.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.020
He and Higgins are in trouble.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.188
Yeah.

29:59.037 --> 30:00.730
So, what happens when they get here?

30:01.867 --> 30:04.301
- Kill all four of us?
- Or five.

30:05.270 --> 30:06.603
She's a witness, too.

30:06.672 --> 30:07.871
Wha-What?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.272
Don't listen to 'em, babe.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.473
They're just messing with your head.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.043
Another word out of you,
last words you ever say.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.592
- Gordon.
- Save it.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.828
Your pal Icepick is going
down for murder one,

30:31.897 --> 30:33.463
and you helped cover it up.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.631
That makes you an accessory.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.059
I get that.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.002
You could face charges.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.805
I know. We don't really have
time for that right now.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.840
Yeah, he's right.
Let's just get our friends back

30:43.909 --> 30:45.318
and worry about the rest later.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.449
Stay on comms.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.588
And these are to be
used only if necessary.

31:00.873 --> 31:02.302
Sure you don't want
to give me the bigger gun?

31:02.327 --> 31:04.327
Just follow me.

31:13.049 --> 31:15.649
Reese is armed. He's got Thomas, Higgins

31:15.674 --> 31:17.073
and the homeowner in the living room.

31:17.142 --> 31:18.575
But there could be other hostiles

31:18.600 --> 31:19.899
in there I can't see.

31:21.604 --> 31:23.231
Make the call.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.543
It's Rick.

31:27.611 --> 31:28.618
Put it on speaker.

31:31.364 --> 31:32.589
Rick. What's going on?

31:32.658 --> 31:33.757
We're on our way.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.026
Should be there in about ten minutes.

31:36.094 --> 31:38.094
Okay. See you soon.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.866
All right,
it's go time. You got two entry points,

31:42.934 --> 31:44.267
- front and back.
- Copy that.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.802
Front door.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.246
- There's someone out there.
- Son of a bitch!

32:03.055 --> 32:04.554
- Gordon!
- He hit my vest.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.356
Go get him. Go get him.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.692
Don't move!

32:27.779 --> 32:29.297
Terrific.

35:25.977 --> 35:27.610
Magnum!

36:26.858 --> 36:28.391
You okay?

36:28.460 --> 36:30.126
Yeah.

36:30.493 --> 36:32.362
How did you know I wasn't gonna go flying

36:32.431 --> 36:33.763
off the top of that thing?

36:33.832 --> 36:35.365
I knew you'd do something.

36:35.915 --> 36:37.186
How?

36:37.234 --> 36:41.638
Because after two years,
Magnum, I think I know you.

36:44.501 --> 36:46.635
Better late than never, I guess.

37:03.234 --> 37:05.428
Mind if I have a moment?

37:05.497 --> 37:06.738
You got a minute.

37:08.412 --> 37:09.778
Hey.

37:11.403 --> 37:14.003
Listen, I'm sorry for everything, kid.

37:14.072 --> 37:15.672
I know you are.

37:15.740 --> 37:19.842
I was just, uh, scared of wasting away.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.611
Looking for one last thrill.

37:24.213 --> 37:25.815
I should've gone skydiving.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.284
Hey, look,

37:28.353 --> 37:30.653
I don't want you to feel bad for me.

37:30.722 --> 37:33.356
I lived my life the way I wanted to.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.426
And most parts, I'm... I'm proud of,

37:36.893 --> 37:38.695
other parts not so much.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.698
But the part that had to do with you...

37:43.974 --> 37:45.974
...I'm most proud of that.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.299
'Cause you turned out
to be one hell of a man.

38:07.792 --> 38:09.726
And always be grateful for them.

38:09.794 --> 38:11.427
Family.

38:12.364 --> 38:15.365
That's all we got... in the end.

38:18.570 --> 38:20.036
I'll see you soon.

38:20.105 --> 38:21.538
I love you.

38:25.342 --> 38:27.269
Expect to hear from the
prosecuting attorney.

38:39.858 --> 38:41.858
We got you, brother.

38:56.942 --> 38:58.708
Higgins is leaving today.

38:58.777 --> 39:01.244
I did everything I could
to keep her here.

39:01.313 --> 39:04.547
I'm not sure if there was
anything else I could've done.

39:04.616 --> 39:07.550
She drives me crazy, but I got to admit,

39:07.619 --> 39:08.918
I'm really gonna miss her.

39:21.299 --> 39:24.000
I trust that Magnum will look
after you as I have done.

39:26.037 --> 39:28.438
Try not to be too hard on him, all right?

39:32.310 --> 39:34.644
I know it doesn't look like it
from the outside, but

39:34.713 --> 39:37.213
he can be quite fragile.

39:43.186 --> 39:47.056
That being said, do give him
a nick once in a while,

39:47.125 --> 39:48.758
remind him who's boss.

39:50.528 --> 39:52.228
I'm gonna miss you.

39:54.971 --> 39:56.504
Juliet?

39:57.576 --> 39:59.876
TC just landed. Mr. Masters is here.

39:59.901 --> 40:01.662
Okay.

40:02.663 --> 40:05.408
Good boy. He's a good boy.

40:05.477 --> 40:06.529
Yes.

40:39.242 --> 40:41.244
Looks like Robin made it.

40:41.312 --> 40:42.645
He's up at the house.

40:46.249 --> 40:47.884
So, I guess this is it.

40:47.952 --> 40:51.020
Actually... it's not.

40:52.046 --> 40:53.856
Turns out I don't have
to leave after all.

40:54.465 --> 40:55.591
What do you mean?

40:57.829 --> 41:00.596
Robin met with the attorney, and together

41:00.665 --> 41:02.432
they resolved my visa status.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.735
It's all taken care of.

41:06.771 --> 41:08.004
So you're not going?

41:08.073 --> 41:09.238
Uh, you want me to?

41:09.307 --> 41:10.406
No.

41:10.475 --> 41:12.108
Not at all. I'm just...

41:13.778 --> 41:15.194
...surprised.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.613
What did they do?

41:18.322 --> 41:20.750
It turns out, there's this
obscure law in the book

41:20.819 --> 41:25.021
that says if you own a company
that's valued at $500,000

41:25.090 --> 41:27.190
and you have at least five employees,

41:27.258 --> 41:29.158
then you're entitled to a visa.

41:29.227 --> 41:31.027
Yeah, but you don't have that.

41:32.063 --> 41:33.996
No. No, I don't.

41:34.065 --> 41:35.832
But, uh...

41:35.900 --> 41:39.202
...thanks to Robin, I now do.

41:39.270 --> 41:41.304
I still don't understand.

41:43.575 --> 41:48.244
Robin's just signed over full
ownership of his estate to me.

41:50.281 --> 41:52.749
You now own Robin's Nest?

41:53.785 --> 41:56.753
Yes. And all of its contents.

41:56.821 --> 42:00.690
And with employees like Kumu
as cultural curator and,

42:00.759 --> 42:04.193
well, you as security
consultant, amongst the others,

42:04.262 --> 42:07.864
I'll be allowed to retain
my legal resident status.

42:07.932 --> 42:10.466
So, technically, we now work for you?

42:12.537 --> 42:15.138
Well, yes, I mean, there's no
"technically" about it,

42:15.206 --> 42:16.272
actually, Magnum.

42:16.341 --> 42:18.007
You and all the other employees

42:18.076 --> 42:19.809
are now on my payroll.

42:21.012 --> 42:22.178
Okay.

42:23.648 --> 42:25.181
How is this gonna work?

42:27.652 --> 42:29.810
That remains to be seen.

42:31.156 --> 42:33.272
Anyway, best not keep Robin waiting.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.826
You know, I'm not sure
I like this new setup.

42:36.895 --> 42:38.995
Well, Magnum, you kind of
only have yourself to blame.

42:39.063 --> 42:40.830
You were the one that put
this whole thing in motion.

42:40.899 --> 42:42.899
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

42:43.902 --> 42:45.635
What about the Ferrari?

42:45.703 --> 42:46.803
Oh, the Ferrari?

42:46.871 --> 42:50.239
Yes, well, technically, that's now mine.

42:50.308 --> 42:52.408
You know, I think I might rechristen it.

42:52.477 --> 42:54.610
Higgins 2. What do you think?

42:54.679 --> 42:56.145
I hate it.

42:56.214 --> 42:58.314
Ah, reckon I will, then.
