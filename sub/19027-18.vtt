WEBVTT

00:01.208 --> 00:03.250
Oh, what a cutie.

00:03.333 --> 00:04.583
Where did this
little guy come from?

00:04.667 --> 00:07.250
Doug found him in some
dead guy's colon.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.375
Aah!

00:09.250 --> 00:10.625
Hey, little guy.

00:10.709 --> 00:13.041
Doug's still pretty upset
about the whole thing.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.458
Why would he live in there?

00:15.542 --> 00:19.291
Diseased rodents shouldn't be
nowhere near my pregnant Princess.

00:19.375 --> 00:21.500
(J.D.) <i>Carla being pregnant</i>
<i>changed everyone.</i>

00:21.834 --> 00:23.583
<i>It made Dr. Kelso softer.</i>

00:24.583 --> 00:28.333
I think that children in pediatrics
would love this little fella.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.875
(J.D.) <i>Carla's pregnancy also</i>
<i>affected Elliot.</i>

00:32.583 --> 00:34.667
Ok, so, we're both off
in a few minutes.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.834
Here's what's gonna happen.

00:35.917 --> 00:38.583
-We're heading back to my place.
-Oh, yeah.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.917
I'm gonna put on something very
nice.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.792
-Awesome.
-And then we're gonna have sex

00:42.875 --> 00:44.125
and pretend that we aren't using
protection

00:44.208 --> 00:45.458
and that we're trying
to make a baby.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.792
-Un-awesome.
-Keith, we're doing this.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.125
I need it.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.125
(J.D.) <i>As for me, I bought</i>
<i>a custom-made Italian suit.</i>

00:55.792 --> 00:57.709
Huh? What do you think?

00:57.792 --> 00:59.417
I had it made for the christening.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.083
That little mixed-race embryo
got a Godfather yet?

01:03.166 --> 01:06.083
J.D., that's something we have to
discuss as a couple.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.667
You know what?

01:08.750 --> 01:11.291
I'm not sure that suit works on you.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.083
Thanks for your opinion, Carla...

01:14.375 --> 01:17.208
but I'm much more interested
in what you all think.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.125
We don't love it.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.083
Well, who cares, Lonnie?

01:21.166 --> 01:26.125
Because all that really matters
is whether or not America loves it.

01:26.208 --> 01:32.125
For the last time, it's a miracle,
and of course I love it.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.750
I made it.

01:33.834 --> 01:37.041
He's a dynamite tailor.
Not sure why he's here.

01:37.625 --> 01:40.125
You better put your scrubs on.
Herbert's back.

01:40.208 --> 01:42.000
-Wha--
-Shh.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.500
How you doing, buddy?

01:43.583 --> 01:44.583
(J.D.)<i> Because of his weight,</i>

01:44.667 --> 01:47.333
<i>Herbert was a frequent visitor</i>
<i>and no one liked treating him.</i>

01:47.417 --> 01:48.917
<i>It wasn't a mean thing.</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:52.250
<i>See, with big people, even the</i>
<i>simple stuff is more difficult.</i>

01:53.458 --> 01:55.792
<i>I didn't mind because</i>
<i>Herbie was my man.</i>

01:55.875 --> 01:57.458
How you feeling, love bug?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.083
Fully loaded.

01:59.166 --> 02:01.667
Hey, it's time for my sponge bath,
right?

02:02.458 --> 02:03.458
I need 3 girls.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.375
Herbie, it's not a bathhouse.

02:09.583 --> 02:12.500
We'll get those bandages off
later today, Mr. Brooks. All right?

02:12.583 --> 02:13.750
-Mm-hmm.
-(whistles)

02:13.834 --> 02:15.792
Ok, as you all know,

02:15.875 --> 02:19.625
Sacred Heart is dealing with a
mountain of malpractice lawsuits,

02:19.709 --> 02:21.542
courtesy of bumbling interns,

02:21.625 --> 02:23.625
clueless doctors, and hack surgeons

02:23.709 --> 02:26.333
or, as I like to refer to them,
"you people."

02:27.000 --> 02:28.834
Now, since sweaty Teddy here

02:28.917 --> 02:31.125
backs up his infinitesimal
knowledge of the law

02:31.208 --> 02:34.041
with absolutely zero
knowledge of medicine,

02:34.125 --> 02:36.667
one of you is going to have to help
him go through the claims,

02:36.750 --> 02:39.667
decipher the medical stuff
and somehow relay all of that

02:39.750 --> 02:41.166
into his tiny peanut brain.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.667
Ted, how many times did I insult you
during that speech?

02:43.750 --> 02:44.750
I was shooting for 5.

02:44.834 --> 02:47.917
Only 3, unless you count "sweaty
Teddy" as an insult.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.417
But my mom calls me that,
and she loves me, right?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
No, Ted. She hates you. 4.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.750
Now, since Ted has no life--
and that's 5...

02:56.291 --> 02:58.500
I'm going to let him
hand-select his very own victim.

02:58.583 --> 03:01.083
-Ted.
-I'll take Claire.

03:01.709 --> 03:02.875
Oh, God.

03:02.959 --> 03:05.208
You turned me down
14 times for drinks.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.125
Well, who's the creepy
little loser now, huh?

03:08.208 --> 03:11.291
(J.D.)<i> And just like that, I had</i>
<i>the chance to comfort Claire.</i>

03:11.375 --> 03:14.125
You look like you need to be
rescued.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.291
(J.D.) <i>Life was good.</i>

03:15.375 --> 03:17.625
<i>But then came a surprise visit</i>
<i>from my brother</i>

03:17.709 --> 03:20.959
<i>and a round of the game he likes to</i>
<i>call "watch her leave."</i>

03:21.500 --> 03:22.834
There's no easy way to say this.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.500
We got the crabs.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.667
Wow. She was cute.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.625
-Yes, she was, Dan. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:30.959 --> 03:32.458
We'll be right back.

03:34.417 --> 03:35.625
Was he talking to us?

03:35.709 --> 03:38.333
Don't know. Don't care.
Here. Take this.

So, Dan, to what
do we owe this something?

03:58.500 --> 04:00.709
I had to blow out of town.
Mom doinked her boyfriend

04:00.792 --> 04:03.500
and then guilted him into getting me
a job interview where he works.

04:04.291 --> 04:06.375
Well, you know,
mom does what she has to do.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.375
What do I need
with a full-time job?

04:08.458 --> 04:11.000
I got a sweet setup at home. I got a
sweet pad up in mom's attic.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.250
I'm driving dad's old Plymouth
horizon, rest his soul.

04:13.333 --> 04:16.166
And because I'm the senior
bartender at K.J.'s,

04:16.250 --> 04:19.166
I get to take home half the extra
chicken wings, thank you.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.834
Dan, do you ever have
to pinch yourself

04:21.917 --> 04:24.041
to make sure it's not
all some crazy dream?

04:24.583 --> 04:28.333
That does not count
as a formal hello, Coxsmith.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.834
-Don't call him Coxsmith.
-I call him Coxsmith.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.542
-Well, ok.
-What's new around here?

04:32.333 --> 04:33.583
Carla's pregnant.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.000
Dude.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.333
Bummer.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.083
No. We're trying to have kids.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.166
Oh, congratulations. That's great.

04:40.709 --> 04:42.208
Not really a big kid person.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.709
Are you guys totally freaking out?

04:44.792 --> 04:46.125
-No.
-No.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.917
(J.D.) <i>And they weren't.</i>
<i>They were taking it all in stride.</i>

04:50.000 --> 04:52.208
Here's how I think
we should name our baby.

04:52.291 --> 04:55.959
It's what my parents did. If it's a
girl, I get to pick the name.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.291
-If it's a boy, you pick the name.
-Ok.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.250
I like Angie for a girl.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.333
And if it's a boy,
say hello to Fuquan.

05:03.417 --> 05:04.750
Wassup?

05:04.834 --> 05:07.375
Ok, you know what? Maybe we should
pick the names together.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.792
Ok. 'Cause I was thinking for a
girl--

05:10.875 --> 05:13.125
Sweetie, we already have
the girl's name.

05:13.208 --> 05:16.291
Now, for the boy, why not name him
after your cousin?

05:16.375 --> 05:17.875
Tiger?

05:17.959 --> 05:20.125
Turk, I'm begging you to stop
telling people that.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.375
No one believes you.

05:21.458 --> 05:25.125
Well, tell that to the last 2 women
I slept with before you. Ok?

05:25.208 --> 05:28.208
Shaboing boing. Oh, God.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.750
I'm talking about your other cousin,
George.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.250
-I like that.
-Yeah.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.834
George and Angie. All right.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.041
Oh, and, Turk, you mention
the names to anyone,

05:37.125 --> 05:39.250
they'll ruin them for us,
so don't tell anyone, ok?

05:39.917 --> 05:41.375
No one.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.709
What's up, my Negro amigo?

05:46.959 --> 05:47.959
Nothing.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.083
Hey, look, I paged you

05:50.166 --> 05:52.375
'cause I can't figure out
what's going on with Herbert.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.750
He's got acute back pain.

05:55.417 --> 05:57.125
If we have a girl,
we're gonna name her Angie.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.208
Hey, boys.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.208
Hey, Chris, if there was a test

Dan train. Whoo-whoo!

06:38.959 --> 06:40.333
-Thanks a lot, dude.
-What?

06:40.417 --> 06:42.625
The Dan train used
to hook up with Elliot.

06:42.709 --> 06:43.917
So?

06:44.250 --> 06:46.667
So? Man, your boy J.D.'S
been telling him

06:46.750 --> 06:48.041
that Elliot still likes him.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.041
Doctor-patient confidentiality
goes both ways,

06:51.125 --> 06:53.875
Mr. "I prefer my temperature taken
through the back door."

06:53.959 --> 06:55.625
What? I mean, it tickles.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.000
Look, Dan doesn't exactly have
the world by the tail.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.250
Ok, and every time
he calls me all depressed,

07:01.333 --> 07:02.750
the only thing I can
think of to cheer him up

07:02.834 --> 07:04.834
was to say "Elliot still digs you."

07:05.542 --> 07:08.750
I'm just trying to find a way to
make him feel good about himself.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.667
If we have a boy,
we're gonna name him George.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.208
What about Tiger?

07:13.291 --> 07:14.834
Hey, man, where your brother go
anyway?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.417
Oh, boy.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.917
Call Elliot.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.750
No. Call Elliot.

07:24.709 --> 07:25.792
No.

07:26.417 --> 07:28.917
No-- call Elliot.

07:29.792 --> 07:30.792
Got her.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.834
(rings)

07:33.709 --> 07:37.208
We don't want any distractions
while we try to make a baby.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.583
-Ok, you got to stop saying that.
-Keith, we're role-playing.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.667
This is not real.
Now, let's just do this.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.834
All right.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.208
Promise me that you'll
hold me like this

07:50.291 --> 07:52.709
when I'm pushing your baby
out my bajingo.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.625
All right, I'm putting on a third
condom.

07:54.709 --> 07:55.959
Keith.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.875
(phone rings)

07:58.667 --> 07:59.667
What?

07:59.750 --> 08:00.750
(doorbell rings)

08:01.208 --> 08:04.375
No, J.D. I'm not gonna act
like I want to bone your brother.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.792
I'm telling him the truth.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.709
Hey, Elliot's wearing lingerie.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.125
Hey, Dan.
J.D. told me you were coming.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.583
This is Keith.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.417
I'm sure you're a little
disappointed.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.250
Yeah. Maybe. I go first.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.125
Um... Um...

08:23.208 --> 08:26.291
Elliot, you have to ask me
about things like this.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.500
And that is the father
of my fake baby.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.125
I've got to go down
to Jack's preschool.

08:38.208 --> 08:41.750
Apparently, Seymour was teasing him,
so he punched him in the face.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.792
Do Seymour's parents
have to go down there?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.583
I doubt it. They're turtles.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.000
Count yourself lucky.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.333
My son just sent me
a picture of himself

08:49.417 --> 08:51.834
sitting on the lap of his
new boyfriend Winston.

08:51.917 --> 08:52.917
(both) Oh.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.291
Why are they dressed up as <i>Tonto</i>
and the <i>Lone Ranger</i>?

08:56.375 --> 08:58.792
I'd like to tell you they're going
to a costume party,

08:58.875 --> 09:00.959
but apparently those are their
jammies.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.041
Look at the bright side.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.250
He is like the daughter that you
never had,

09:04.333 --> 09:06.000
only gay and unsuccessful.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.917
Ha! Tell me about it.

09:10.542 --> 09:12.709
So funny the way kids are, isn't it?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.333
You never know
how it's gonna go.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.166
(J.D.)<i> Now that Dan knew</i>
<i>Elliot wasn't into him,</i>

09:18.250 --> 09:20.583
<i>my focus had shifted from keeping</i>
<i>him away from her</i>

09:20.667 --> 09:22.875
<i>to avoiding him</i>
<i>so he doesn't kill him.</i>

09:24.542 --> 09:25.917
Hey, Mr. Brooks.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Let's get these bandages off you,
huh?

09:30.375 --> 09:31.375
What are you doing here?

09:31.458 --> 09:34.583
Mr. Brooks wanted some safety tips
on operating propane heaters.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.375
As long as you're not my brother.

09:36.458 --> 09:39.458
I had a brother once. I shouldn't
say "once." He's still my brother.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.542
My parents adopted him
when I was about 12.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.959
He was about 46.
Actually older than my parents.

09:46.041 --> 09:47.709
His name was Clete.
He talked like this.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.333
"Way to go. Way to go."

09:50.083 --> 09:51.542
Good kid.
Did what they said.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.250
Make the bed, mop the floor,

09:53.333 --> 09:54.709
sweep the lawn,
whatever had to be done.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.500
Everything was good
until he was in his 50s.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.667
Then, wow, did he have
a midlife crisis.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.250
Him and my dad
had fought constantly.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.750
Really physically
beating on each other.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.750
But I don't blame him for it,
though.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.333
I blame my mom for sleeping
with him.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.834
That's just out of line.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.250
-Yeah.
-The reason I'm telling you this

10:10.333 --> 10:13.750
is because your brother told me that
if I could keep you focused on me,

10:13.834 --> 10:15.667
-he would let me watch.
-Watch what?

10:17.542 --> 10:19.083
Hey, little brother.

10:19.458 --> 10:20.458
(crashing)

10:22.709 --> 10:24.083
I can't believe
those kids are playing

10:24.166 --> 10:25.500
with that dead guy's
butt hamster.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.125
That is disgusting.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.333
It's my turn to hold Angie.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.250
What did she call that thing?

10:34.333 --> 10:36.250
-Baby, we should go.
-Ah.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.291
Where did you come up
with that name?

10:40.291 --> 10:42.291
I guess I could help you name her.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.792
Let's see.
She's a girl hamster.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.375
What about Angie?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.792
-I love it.
-Me, too. Angie, guys?

10:48.875 --> 10:51.500
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
-Angie it is.

10:55.959 --> 10:56.959
Hold his arms.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.208
Turk, it was an accident.
The name just popped into my head.

11:00.291 --> 11:02.792
Shut up!
You just shut up right now.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.458
Pink belly.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.375
No! Turk!

11:07.458 --> 11:08.500
(J.D.) <i>Unfortunately,</i>

11:08.583 --> 11:11.875
<i>Turk was the greatest pink</i>
<i>bellyer in all the land.</i>

11:11.959 --> 11:14.458
Aah!

11:14.542 --> 11:18.375
You know, Bobbo, I find you less
repugnant as of late.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.959
Dare I say I'm developing a
begrudging indifference to you.

11:21.041 --> 11:23.542
Ah, Perry, you're so edgy
and cantankerous.

11:23.625 --> 11:25.250
You're like hause.
Without the limp.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.250
Ted, I've decided this project

11:28.333 --> 11:30.208
is over the head of that pretty
little lady there,

11:30.291 --> 11:32.208
so Dr. Cox will be replacing her.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.250
That was the longest
3 hours of my life.

11:36.875 --> 11:37.875
(Ted) Call me!

11:39.375 --> 11:41.125
I'll tell you what
she's not good at.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.792
Staring contests.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.166
Why, Bob?

11:46.667 --> 11:47.917
Why the hell not?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.792
So, Herbert, how you
doing with your diet?

11:52.875 --> 11:55.166
The best I can do, man.
How's your tummy?

11:55.250 --> 11:58.750
Turk was so proud of his handiwork
that he signed it.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.834
I think he knows it's so painful,

12:00.917 --> 12:02.750
I won't be able
to wash it for some time.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.750
Hey, man, y'all two ok?

12:05.375 --> 12:06.792
(J.D.) <i>Actually, we were,</i>

12:06.875 --> 12:08.333
<i>because the way the whole</i>
<i>brother thing works,</i>

12:08.417 --> 12:11.000
<i>now that Dan had beaten me up,</i>
<i>it was all over.</i>

12:11.083 --> 12:12.417
Why did you lie
to me about Elliot?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.959
(J.D.) <i>Or not.</i>

12:14.041 --> 12:15.041
Oh, come on, man.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.709
A girl like Elliot could never
really be into somebody like you.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.000
Why wouldn't she be into me?

12:21.083 --> 12:22.542
(J.D.) <i>The obvious response was,</i>

12:22.625 --> 12:25.041
<i>"Elliot was looking for a guy</i>
<i>with more going on in his life."</i>

12:25.583 --> 12:28.667
<i>And the only way to gently break</i>
<i>that to my brother was this.</i>

12:29.333 --> 12:33.250
Elliot wants to have kids right now
and she knows you're not ready.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.083
Oh.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.291
Bummer.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.917
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
He bought it. It's cool.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.667
(J.D.)<i> I have to talk to Elliot</i>
<i>before my brother Dan does.</i>

12:52.417 --> 12:54.667
Herbert, I'm afraid your back pain
may involve your spinal cord,

12:54.750 --> 12:57.458
-so we need to get you an M.R.I.
-Now, where is my pen?

12:57.542 --> 13:00.417
Elliot!

13:02.250 --> 13:05.250
-What's up, J.D.?
-My brother's on his way up.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.500
You have to tell him the only reason
you don't wanna be with him

13:07.583 --> 13:09.041
is 'cause he doesn't
want kids right now.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.208
J.D., just tell him the truth.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.375
Elliot, the last time I was honest
with Dan about his life,

13:15.458 --> 13:16.959
it just made him feel like crap,

13:17.041 --> 13:19.041
and he didn't talk to me again
until our dad died.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.208
You really want me to do that?

13:20.291 --> 13:22.959
'Cause I'm not sure what would get
us back together this time.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.792
Dad can't die again.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.792
What's going on, guys?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.792
I'm not having a staring
contest with you, Ted.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.625
Ok. 1-nothing, me. Oh, yeah.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.625
Yeah.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.125
Ok, back to work.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.375
This next patient claims their...

13:49.041 --> 13:51.875
Stent was implanted incorrectly.
What's a stent?

13:51.959 --> 13:54.041
A tube that holds arteries open.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.417
All right.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.083
And...

13:58.041 --> 14:00.667
What's a buckland?

14:00.750 --> 14:03.333
It's a predominantly hairless growth
that's never found on women.

14:04.041 --> 14:05.333
Weird.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.542
It's your last name, Ted.

14:09.625 --> 14:10.875
Good one.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.458
So, uh, you got the baby fever, huh?

14:16.542 --> 14:19.625
Yep. Hopefully, I'm already pregnant
with Keith's child.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.208
Oh, come on!

14:21.834 --> 14:23.834
I'm 25.
I haven't even been to Europe.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.083
Keith, wait.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.917
I got a good feeling
about those two.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.000
-Well, I'm off.
-All right, man.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.166
-Say hi to mom for me.
-Yep. Get my stuff.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.875
(J.D.)
<i>And like that, he was gone.</i>

14:39.000 --> 14:41.208
You know what name I've always liked
for a girl?

14:42.458 --> 14:43.542
Honor.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.083
Turk, you know how mean boys are.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.208
They'd be all like, "I got Honor.
Did you get Honor?"

14:49.917 --> 14:52.625
"Yeah, everybody got Honor.
She's easy."

14:53.291 --> 14:55.041
-It's your daughter.
-Yes, it is.

14:55.458 --> 14:59.125
It's just weird. Angie was perfect.
Now nothing seems as good.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.875
What you got there, sir?

15:02.959 --> 15:04.583
Dead hamster.

15:04.667 --> 15:05.875
Angie's dead?

15:06.875 --> 15:09.166
-Baby, we got our name back.
-Yeah.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.333
Sir, if no one's
officially called dibs...

15:12.417 --> 15:13.667
Take it, freak.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.250
What?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.875
I'm making a hamster vest
for one of my squirrels.

15:20.750 --> 15:21.750
What's going on?

15:22.250 --> 15:24.834
I love you, too, dumpling,
but I have to work late.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.917
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.333
Ted's on the phone with his mom,
so we're taking a 5.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.125
Why?
Why is Kelso doing this to me?

15:33.208 --> 15:35.250
-Well, you know.
-No, I don't.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.000
All I remember is that we were both
making fun of our kids,

15:38.083 --> 15:39.667
and then, bam,
he stuck me with Ted.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.166
No, no.
You made fun of your kid.

15:42.250 --> 15:46.834
He made fun of his kid,
and then you made fun of his kid.

15:46.917 --> 15:51.166
Don't you get it? You can never say
bad things about someone else's kid.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.542
Ever.

15:53.917 --> 15:56.834
If you can't reach
that spot with the lotion,

15:56.917 --> 15:59.333
I'll get it for you
when I get home late tonight.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.166
Ok. Kisses.

16:02.667 --> 16:06.291
-You ready to get back in there?
-Yeah. Got to vomit first.

16:06.834 --> 16:07.834
Ok.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.750
Ok, guys, let's all gather around.
Huddle up.

16:10.834 --> 16:14.625
You guys, Herbert
in there needs an M.R.I.,

16:14.709 --> 16:16.083
but he won't fit into our machine.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.417
What should we do?

16:17.500 --> 16:18.834
(J.D.)<i> Nobody wanted to say it.</i>

16:18.917 --> 16:22.500
<i>But sometimes when hospitals have</i>
<i>Herbert-size patients,</i>

16:22.583 --> 16:23.959
<i>we'll send them to the one place</i>

16:24.041 --> 16:25.875
<i>that has M.R.I. machines big enough.</i>

16:26.458 --> 16:27.583
<i>The zoo.</i>

16:27.667 --> 16:29.333
I know what you're all thinking.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.792
But I'm not gonna do that to
Herbert. It's too humiliating.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.417
Herbert, you're too big
for our M.R.I. Machine,

16:38.500 --> 16:39.959
so we're gonna have
to take you to the zoo.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.250
Damn.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.250
Well, that sucks.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.333
You kind of brought this
on yourself, didn't you?

16:49.125 --> 16:50.542
Why do you hate Herbert?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.917
He's been here 7 times,
all for weight-related problems.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.583
He's never even tried
to get healthier.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.834
Sometimes protecting someone's
feelings isn't the best way to go.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.750
Spare me the tough love speech.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.917
You really think that going in there
being mean to Herbert

17:03.000 --> 17:05.542
is gonna cause him to turn his life
around and lose a hundred pounds?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.458
Probably not.
But as long as I'm still in there

17:07.542 --> 17:09.875
trying to get him to change,
then I can sleep at night.

17:10.667 --> 17:14.000
When you think about your brother
later, how are you gonna sleep?

17:20.458 --> 17:22.625
-Angie and George.
-Hmm.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.959
Wow.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.959
-You know what's weird?
-Hmm?

17:26.041 --> 17:30.041
Now that they have names,
everything seems so real.

17:30.625 --> 17:31.959
I can see George's smile.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.083
I can see Angie
having your curly hair.

17:35.417 --> 17:38.041
I hope she doesn't have
my ear infections.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.166
I was really sick as a baby.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.166
I was a climber. Our windows don't
have bars on them.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.250
If George gets up there,
he's falling right into the alley.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.125
What if George doesn't love me?

17:49.208 --> 17:50.792
What if Angie stops
breathing in her sleep?

17:51.625 --> 17:53.375
Why did we have to pick
these stupid names?

17:53.458 --> 17:54.750
I hate it when things get real.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.500
When I was in high school,

17:56.583 --> 17:59.166
I had a shop teacher named
George who hated black people.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.875
There was a prostitute at my town
mall. Her name was Angie.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.583
Great. Well, those names are out.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.250
-Yeah, they're out.
-We don't need new ones.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.291
Don't need new ones for 9 months.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.917
-I'm ready for bed.
-Me, too.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.333
Hey, Bob, you got a minute?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.583
If you killed Ted,
I don't wanna know about it.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.750
Just make sure it's not traceable
to the hospital.

18:18.291 --> 18:21.041
That's not why I'm here,
but it's good to know.

18:22.083 --> 18:27.875
Look, uh, I just wanted to apologize
for what I said about your son.

18:27.959 --> 18:33.166
Well, he hasn't turned out
exactly as I planned.

18:34.375 --> 18:36.041
For example, I always imagined

18:36.125 --> 18:38.959
we'd spend his 13th birthday
fly-fishing in Montana.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.458
-Where did you spend it?
-On 42nd street,

18:41.542 --> 18:43.959
camped out for
<i>Ain't Misbehavin'</i> tickets.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.875
He's a good kid, though.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.041
Tell me about him.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.041
He is a good kid.
He's always been a good kid.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.041
The first time I knew
we weren't on the same page

18:55.125 --> 18:57.542
-was when he took up knitting.
-Knitting?

18:57.625 --> 19:00.125
Yeah. I thought he was gonna
learn how to tie knots.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.500
Hey, Dan.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.583
Hey, Johnny. Just packing up.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.458
Thought you had to work.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.750
I do, but I wanna talk to you
about something.

19:12.834 --> 19:13.834
Yeah. What's up?

19:15.291 --> 19:17.542
Elliot doesn't wanna
have babies with Keith.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.041
Oh. Tough break for Keith.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.166
You know, I almost had
a threesome with that guy.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.500
When I said Elliot would
never be into a guy like you...

19:27.125 --> 19:29.834
it's because you're
a 35-year-old bartender

19:29.917 --> 19:31.500
who still lives in our mother's
attic

19:31.583 --> 19:33.083
and is showing no signs of changing.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.333
I'm not saying this to make you feel
bad, Dan.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.917
I'm telling you this because I think

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
you've the potential to do whatever
you wanna do with your life.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.667
But you have to actually try.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
(J.D.) <i>And then I got the answer</i>
<i>I expected.</i>

19:47.500 --> 19:48.917
Don't you have to go back to work?

19:56.166 --> 19:58.291
(J.D.)<i> Even though I knew my brother</i>
<i>wasn't gonna change,</i>

19:58.375 --> 19:59.375
<i>Elliot was right.</i>

19:59.458 --> 20:01.291
<i>It comes down to what</i>
<i>helps you sleep at night...</i>

20:01.375 --> 20:02.709
Who are we kidding?

20:02.792 --> 20:05.625
This is so real now.
There's no way we can sleep.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.250
(J.D.) w<i>hether it's a strong sense</i>
<i>of denial...</i>

20:12.208 --> 20:14.000
<i>or the fact that you love your son.</i>

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
(J.D.) <i>As for me, I was just happy</i>
<i>to get some rest.</i>

20:22.083 --> 20:25.250
(beeping)

20:26.959 --> 20:27.959
Hey.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.208
Hey, Johnny. Are you cool
that I borrow this suit?

20:33.291 --> 20:36.041
I might wear it to that job
interview.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.542
You know what, man?
You might as well just keep it.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.250
Yeah, I'll keep it.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.709
Hey, uh, you think anyone
would ever really hire me?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.500
I think you can do
whatever you wanna do.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.959
Take it easy, little brother.
