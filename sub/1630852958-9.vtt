WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:04.903
Sometimes being too
confident comes back

00:04.922 --> 00:07.339
to bite you in the ass and she's
going to learn the hard way.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.933
Sometimes you make
a lot of things about you.

00:17.968 --> 00:19.585
You're being a ----ing
idiot, so...

00:19.620 --> 00:21.520
-No, I'm not being an idiot,
-you better stop it.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.955
-I'm just like, you know...
-You know what? [bleep] off.

00:22.990 --> 00:26.442
Gabby's disrespect for me
is a no-no.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.831
She's a kiss-ass.
She wants to be a second stew.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.266
-Come on.
-It's fine.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.534
You can feel what you want.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.971
We don't have to be
best friends.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.606
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:40.641 --> 00:45.577
I'm like... Imploding
and I'm so ----ing embarrassed.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.962
Perfect timing.

00:46.997 --> 00:48.981
We all had to say
goodbye to tom.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.382
Obviously, we're man down.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.284
I am working on getting
another deckhand in

00:52.303 --> 00:55.754
very soon, but not until
we drop this one.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.993
Ooh!

01:01.028 --> 01:02.761
What is that slamming?

01:02.797 --> 01:04.146
Oh, jesus christ!

01:04.181 --> 01:05.981
They're going to break!

01:06.016 --> 01:08.700
Ahh, mother----er.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.335
[groans]

01:27.521 --> 01:29.254
ah!

01:29.290 --> 01:30.956
[bleep] me.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.024
-You okay?
-Mm-mm.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.010
-You want ice?
-Mm.

01:35.045 --> 01:38.297
Ah! My...

01:38.332 --> 01:40.766
-[bleep] me.
-Aw, [bleep].

01:42.603 --> 01:44.386
[groans]

01:48.976 --> 01:50.109
yeah.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.028
Yeah.

01:53.063 --> 01:55.447
[groans]

01:58.319 --> 02:01.120
mother----er.

02:03.574 --> 02:05.040
Hopefully we'll be
out of this shortly.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.325
Oh my god.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.493
It's a little crazy
down there.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.862
But you look fabulous, darling.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.764
Here, get some air.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.267
Oh my god.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.070
Oh my god,
I just wanna stop moving.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
[bleep]

02:20.107 --> 02:22.057
he's just hurt his finger.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.542
Hey gary, you okay?

02:23.577 --> 02:24.776
Ah!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.062
[groaning]

02:27.097 --> 02:28.480
hey-oh!

02:30.651 --> 02:33.452
Do you still have your finger?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.821
Look at my finger. Ah!

02:35.856 --> 02:37.573
[bleep]

02:37.608 --> 02:38.907
you haven't worked in
a sailboat unless you've

02:38.943 --> 02:40.409
smashed a finger or toe.

02:40.444 --> 02:43.295
It's okay, okay,
you're gonna be okay.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.630
----Ing hell!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.615
You're always using your
hands with things

02:46.667 --> 02:48.233
that have
so much weight on them.

02:48.252 --> 02:51.253
It literally has to be the most
common injury in a sailboat.

02:51.288 --> 02:53.872
Do you want three
ibuprofen?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.413
Hit his finger
or something like that.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.650
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.968
I just needed a big scream.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.519
I just don't want
to scream outside.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.121
How you doing, man?

03:09.156 --> 03:11.056
Is it all under control now?

03:11.091 --> 03:12.958
That door is locked and bolted?

03:12.993 --> 03:13.959
Cork-screwed. And belt snapped.

03:13.994 --> 03:17.129
The belt snapped? Okay.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.997
Are you okay?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.432
Do you just need a hug?

03:22.636 --> 03:23.669
Do you have iced tea by chance?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.438
-Yes.
-That would make my day.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.123
And I'll have some
more of these bubbles.

03:28.158 --> 03:30.275
Okay.
I feel off this morning.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.211
I don't feel right.
I'm off my game.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.714
Ohh whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.683
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:37.718 --> 03:40.252
I was in
hospitality for 15 years.

03:40.287 --> 03:45.424
Dropping a tray of glassware is
not something that happens ever.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.677
Iced tea. Let's not drop
it this time.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.963
I'm distracted by my thoughts
and problems

03:50.998 --> 03:52.965
and I need to focus on my work

03:53.000 --> 03:56.018
and focus on being
a better team member.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.488
-Ah, thank you. Thank you,
-you're welcome.

03:59.523 --> 04:00.739
Okay, let's try to do this.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.641
Can you go back
there please?

04:02.660 --> 04:03.692
Inside?

04:03.744 --> 04:07.779
No, could you come
sit right here on my lap, kels?

04:09.199 --> 04:10.165
Where?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.500
Pull this line out.

04:11.535 --> 04:13.452
Yeah. I'm coming over
here though.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.753
Where you...
What you doing?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.505
I'm coming... Look at all this.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.124
Can you go to that side and
pull that line out please?

04:19.159 --> 04:20.692
You said come to
your left. Sorry.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.377
I said come to my left cause
that's... Never mind.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.179
Gotcha, okay.
I'm pulling.

04:24.214 --> 04:25.364
Oh, it hurts.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.349
The captive winch got tangled

04:27.384 --> 04:30.686
and gary is
obviously in a ton of pain.

04:30.721 --> 04:32.354
Unhappy with the situation.

04:32.389 --> 04:34.189
No, but pull the slack
that you've got

04:34.224 --> 04:35.440
from your left hand, kels.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.841
I am pulling.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.694
You're not, there's slack here.
Pull!

04:38.729 --> 04:40.779
Come on,
we're better than this.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.533
That just rope burned me,
but it's cool.

04:44.568 --> 04:46.318
<i> Glenn, glenn, gary.</i>

04:46.353 --> 04:47.653
<i> Capstan's done.</i>
<i> You can do what you need.</i>

04:47.688 --> 04:50.222
<i> Okay?</i>

04:50.257 --> 04:51.790
It's like super calm, now.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.991
Normal. Good.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.229
She's the only vegan
and so I have to try to please

04:57.264 --> 04:58.997
everyone a little bit.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.699
<i> Gary, gary, glenn.</i>

05:00.718 --> 05:03.085
Just to let you know I'm gonna
put the staysail away now.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.419
<i> Copy.</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:09.091
Maybe you do from 12 to 12
and I do from 12 to 12.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.225
And that's nine hours sleep

05:10.260 --> 05:12.978
if you come up at 12.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.313
Starting now, yeah.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.250
[cheering]

05:18.285 --> 05:19.751
and a baby.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.854
Okay, honey.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.962
Oh, no.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.264
God.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.032
Ah!

05:34.068 --> 05:35.834
Let her go, let her go.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.788
Knives and forks, salt, pepper.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.608
That feels like
a pretty good bite.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.510
<i> -Yeah.</i>
-That's main engine off.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.014
-How you doing?
-I'm exhausted.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.085
Before I even decided
to enter yachting...

05:53.120 --> 05:54.786
Mm-hmm?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.622
I knew living in close
quarters with your coworkers.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.858
I knew it was gonna be hard,
so I'm disappointed

05:59.893 --> 06:01.977
a little bit
in some of my behavior.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.278
You can control that.

06:03.313 --> 06:04.780
Yes, I know.

06:04.815 --> 06:08.116
I know you can control that,
but it's...

06:08.152 --> 06:10.535
It takes a while to be like,
okay, I'm doing this

06:10.571 --> 06:11.787
-and I don't...
-I don't think so, but...

06:11.822 --> 06:13.655
I don't want it
to affect my job.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.124
Like, I don't want it
to send me home.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.847
Oh, sit down,
think about yourself,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.315
think about what you wanna be.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.083
Yeah, that... I think
that's the biggest thing

06:25.118 --> 06:28.086
is that I want to
come like start fresh.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.492
I get it.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.028
Oh, good chat.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.682
Make me cry.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.068
At this point,
it feels like no one likes me.

06:43.103 --> 06:47.072
I seriously want to crawl into
a hole and ----ing disappear.

06:48.358 --> 06:49.524
Phew.

06:50.694 --> 06:52.544
Here we go.
I want to get the clips.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.447
Ready?
One, two, three.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.998
How you doing mate?

06:57.034 --> 06:57.833
Your hand really hurts?

06:57.868 --> 06:59.317
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.036
[bleep]

07:01.088 --> 07:02.354
-is it throbbing?
-Throbbing, yeah.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.622
Yeah it's swollen for sure.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.656
I mean you're gonna lose
that nail.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.991
I've had that many times.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.509
What I do normally
is I get a hot needle,

07:07.544 --> 07:09.060
I get it red hot.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.712
Poke it through
let the blood out cause

07:10.764 --> 07:12.164
the blood's the pressure.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.999
I had a buddy on another boat,

07:14.034 --> 07:17.102
he was reaching down into
a locker to grab something

07:17.137 --> 07:20.205
and as he was reaching down
with his head kind of on the...

07:20.240 --> 07:24.526
On the frame the door
came down, it crushed his skull

07:24.561 --> 07:27.646
and he was
in hospital for weeks.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.198
He... I mean he was
that close from dying.

07:30.234 --> 07:33.902
There's no harm in splinting
it and then just tape it up.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.704
That could have been way worse.

07:35.739 --> 07:37.322
Ashley, ashley, daisy.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.324
-Start...
-Bringing stuff up.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.992
Yeah, thank you.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.911
I'm going to start
taking stuff, marcos.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.045
Okay.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.532
-Wow.
-That is something.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.201
-Oh my goodness.
-This is beautiful.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.170
So glad this is a light lunch.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.040
Hello, guys.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.144
We have our couscous
salad, grilled vegetables

07:59.179 --> 08:00.762
with balsamic reduction

08:00.814 --> 08:03.265
tarragon lemon chicken
and smoked salmon.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.584
-Smoked with applewood.
-You're the best.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.352
-Alright, guys, enjoy it.
-Thank you.

08:07.387 --> 08:11.406
I really like the variety.
It's just so delicious.

08:11.441 --> 08:13.859
How much weight has
one charter ever gained?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.962
[bleep]

08:16.997 --> 08:18.246
I guess we've kissed already,

08:18.282 --> 08:19.931
it doesn't make
a difference, does it?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.418
Your face.

08:23.453 --> 08:25.070
What, is there stuff?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.922
I never slagged you off.

08:29.459 --> 08:31.009
Gary, come here.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.043
Please!

08:32.078 --> 08:33.745
You need to listen
to the old man.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.680
You see? Okay, okay.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.949
Gary!
Get off of me.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.384
I'll hurt your finger.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.053
-You guys are on one point...
-Going to [bleep].

08:42.088 --> 08:44.022
I don't even
hate-[bleep] people and that's

08:44.057 --> 08:46.625
the closest gary's
having sex with me.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.144
[mock weeping]

08:49.196 --> 08:51.162
now you're cursed.
Now you're cursed.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.815
That salmon is amazing.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.151
This meal is amazing.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.202
-It is.
-Really.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.453
My finger's gone purple.

08:58.488 --> 09:00.005
Yeah, of course
it's bruised, man..

09:00.040 --> 09:02.106
You probably have to do that
whole hot needle thing

09:02.125 --> 09:04.175
because it relieves
the pressure.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.827
You wanna be very careful
you don't go too deep.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.746
You have to put pressure
on to go through your nail.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.881
If it's relatively fresh,
it'll come out as

09:09.917 --> 09:12.217
really dark blood and
that'll relieve the pressure.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.470
The main thing is we just got
nothing else to do right now,

09:15.505 --> 09:17.806
so we poke holes
in each other's nails.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.758
Why the hell not, right?

09:21.345 --> 09:22.310
What do you need it for?

09:22.346 --> 09:23.645
-That.
-Eww. Really?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.730
That's what glenn said.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.316
-Find one?
-Yeah.

09:28.352 --> 09:29.968
Sweet.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.336
Still gonna lose the nail.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.357
[bleep], this is going to hurt.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.708
You hold that.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.043
The trick is to just
go through the nail,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.511
-obviously not to...
-I'll do that.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.946
Not into the skin.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.681
Ready?

09:42.716 --> 09:45.200
-I don't want to poke through.
-[bleep]

09:45.252 --> 09:47.819
-gently, gently.
-Yes.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.255
I never did it on
an angle like that.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.523
Oh, sh--.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.291
[gary shouts]

09:55.328 --> 09:56.661
-ready?
-I don't wanna poke through.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.430
[bleep]

09:58.465 --> 09:59.431
gently, gently.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.932
Ah!

10:00.967 --> 10:03.401
-There we go.
-There, that's what you want.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.071
Should we go up back up top
or what do we wanna do?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.672
[bleep], that's quite easy.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.974
-Look, it's all...
-That's what you want, dude.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.208
Because that's the pressure.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.676
I can move my finger now.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.161
Do you feel less pressure now?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.413
A lot less, that ----ing takes
a lot of the pain away.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.948
So what can I put on this?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.249
Don't think it has to go inside.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.584
It'll kind of work...
You do it.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.953
-Does it hurt?
-Might hurt once it goes inside.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.425
Yeah, get your ass out there.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
----Ing hell, look at that.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.565
Can I get anyone anything?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.533
Uh, yeah, rose.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.435
Sure. Would you like anything?

10:37.471 --> 10:38.470
You're okay with your...

10:42.309 --> 10:44.075
-Captain glenn!
-How's that jacuzzi?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.527
It's getting warmer.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.562
I would love to jump in
the water somewhere though.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.715
We can't open that stern
door with this much swell.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.983
Yeah.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.451
Uh, we could
put you on the ladder.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.819
We'll get you down
in the tender

10:54.855 --> 10:56.121
and you can jump in
from the tender.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.323
-Thank you.
-Suns out buns out.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.430
I'm making all this aioli's,
cashew aioli.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.431
Oh nice.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.866
Should we come on down?

11:07.901 --> 11:09.734
The tenders kind
of jumping around.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.102
Jump in, swim around.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.704
I'll help you get back up.

11:12.723 --> 11:15.473
For a captain. Your first mate
is really your right arm.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.508
Oh...

11:19.680 --> 11:22.747
So now it's like,
okay, let's see what I can do.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.733
Guests are paying
for an experience

11:24.768 --> 11:27.051
and they don't care how
they get their experience.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.987
They just want it.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.156
You can also jump from
the side if you want.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.191
One, two, three, go!

11:33.226 --> 11:34.459
Woo-hoo!

11:34.494 --> 11:35.160
She's bad ass.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.363
-Beautiful.
-Yeah, james!

11:38.398 --> 11:39.631
Holy sh--.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.468
-Oh, pretty.
-Thanks.

11:45.672 --> 11:46.904
This is cute.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.239
If there's a cabin free,
gabriella,

11:48.275 --> 11:49.441
you can go down and do it.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.126
Wait, am I doing cabins
or service?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.644
-Or does it matter?
-Yeah, I think she...

11:52.679 --> 11:54.929
Did we say she was doing
the table and service tonight

11:54.965 --> 11:56.681
and you're
doing it tomorrow night.

11:56.717 --> 11:57.882
I'm tomorrow.
Okay, cool.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.354
♪ be positive,
be be be positive ♪

12:03.390 --> 12:05.924

12:13.834 --> 12:15.800
oh, look at this.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.619
This is lovely.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.170
Come on, broski.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.805
Most people don't know
sh-- about making vegan food.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.341
It's not easy,
but I have a gift.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.695
-You're gonna have enough?
-Yeah.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.930
All right. Vamanos.
Okay.

12:47.317 --> 12:49.300
-Hello.
-Marcos, here he is.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.821
We have a cigalas and
with a salad

12:52.856 --> 12:55.240
and I make a like cherry
vinaigrette

12:55.275 --> 12:56.841
and a white balsamic tarragon.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.943
And for you I
make a beet root

12:58.979 --> 13:00.829
with the cashew aioli and pesto.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.548
-Thank you guys.
-So impressive.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.849
I may turn vegan after
that description.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.085
Honestly, it's lovely.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.654
-What's this thing in here?
-That's the butternut squash.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.256
Butternut squash?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.225
That I'm making like...
Look like a beef tenderloin.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.510
So I'm gonna grill it.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.295
They're going
to look like steak.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.631
You've got a few tricks
up your sleeve, I must say.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.065
-Hey.
-Ah!

13:21.101 --> 13:22.600
What the hell?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.853
You're "yumpy."

13:24.888 --> 13:26.304
I'm "yumpy."

13:28.275 --> 13:30.058
all right, so marty,
what games did you bring?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.276
We're playing
two truths and a lie.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.777
I'll play this game.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.747
I spent a year in tokyo.
I have a tattoo of my body.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.782
Is it a tramp stamp?

13:37.818 --> 13:40.118
Um...

13:40.153 --> 13:43.388
And I could dunk when
I was in 11th grade.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.873
-Wow.
-Can you still do it?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.658
-Nope.
-It was a lie.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.326
Total bullsh--.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.878
How's your finger?

13:49.913 --> 13:50.895
Better.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.896
Still bleeding, though.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.897
Is it still bleeding?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.365
It hurts still.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.383
Yeah, it's gonna hurt,
it's bruised.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.435
Look good, no?
Vamos.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.805
Hey, hey, marcos.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.642
You guys have a rock lobster
tail actually from minorca.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.311
Creamy mashed potato
with vegan butter.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.479
And then for you
I did the same thing but

14:08.515 --> 14:10.181
I make a butternut
squash tenderloin.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.016
-All right enjoy it.
-Thank you.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.686
This is
this food I dream of.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.689
And he did the mashed
potatoes vegan, like, why not?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.891
Make up for today with
the water toys tomorrow, huh?

14:19.910 --> 14:21.693
Yeah, 100%.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.527
Paddleboard, kayak.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.928
Get sea bobs and
and everything out.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.215
wow.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.633
Please, show us more.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.135
This isn't too bad.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.720
You're probably be
in bed earlier.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.940
-I don't...
-What's wrong?

14:51.975 --> 14:53.090
Nothing.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.192
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.960
Everything's fine.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.146
I don't want to like complain
about stupid things.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.231
She--

15:00.266 --> 15:01.482
how are you guys going?

15:02.819 --> 15:03.952
Okay.

15:03.987 --> 15:04.953
Let me know if
you need my help, ash.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.204
Okay.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.705
I'm not dumb.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.624
I can feel vibes and
I can read the ----ing room.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.377
Whatever. I don't want
to make this any worse.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.629
I'm just going to...

15:14.664 --> 15:16.547
Suck it up, I guess?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.548
Nothing.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.083
-Ashley.
-No, nothing's wrong.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.555
It's frustrating, sometimes.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.391
Wakey wakey.
You're up.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.493
-Yeah, how are you?
-I'm good, thanks.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.763
I have a hole on the top of my
head from that car accident.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.598
-Yeah?
-When I blow...

15:33.633 --> 15:34.399
[laughing]

15:34.434 --> 15:35.934
so I told ashley
to clear upstairs

15:35.969 --> 15:36.901
and she can finish at 12.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.302
Okay.

15:38.321 --> 15:40.238
But obviously if you
need her, keep her on.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.907
-I'll be up at 6.
-Okay.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.158
I'm going to bed.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.493
You guys never
seen sh-- like this...

15:45.528 --> 15:47.195
Can I...

15:47.247 --> 15:49.497
[screaming]

15:49.532 --> 15:52.417
sorry I got angry
at you earlier on today.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.952
Pull, you're not pulling.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.987
-I am pulling.
-You're not, there's slack here.

15:56.006 --> 15:57.288
Pull.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.490
I was just
frustrated with myself.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.158
There's nothing against you.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.660
-I know.
-Promise.

16:02.679 --> 16:03.995
I'm sorry I can't read
your mind sometimes.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.964
I wish I could,
but I can't.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.333
If you wanna go to bed,
get some sleepy sleep.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.035
There he goes.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.370
Good night, y'all.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.554
See you in the morning.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.024
Sleep well.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.725
Goodnight, jamie.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.417
I'm talking about you
right now.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.454
Talking about it the
girls in love with you.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.290
[bleep], I don't know.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.325
----Ing daisy would
be a good... Good shag.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.994
Ah, but you see?

16:36.029 --> 16:39.047
Yeah, well, of course it's
in the back of my mind, bro.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.581
Because as much as
she might deny it,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.417
she's definitely
been flirting with me.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.837
Ashley, ashley,
ashley, gabriella.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.308
-Go ahead.
-What's your location?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.760
I'm in the galley
washing the glasses.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.179
Was just going to ask her to
do that. She's already doing it.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.351
Thanks for coming down
here to do this.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.552
No worries.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.088
I was going to ask
you to anyways.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.440
Now I don't have to.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.734
If I don't like you, you will
know that I don't like you

17:16.753 --> 17:18.336
and it's not because I'm
going to get into your face

17:18.371 --> 17:20.922
and make sure you know,

17:20.957 --> 17:22.573
it's because I'm not
going to talk to you.

17:22.592 --> 17:23.925
I'm not going
to acknowledge you.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.460
All right, I'm out.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.544
Before I'm told to
do anything else.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.346
I will just shut you out.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.086
Coming up...

17:35.121 --> 17:36.087
It's crazy.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.388
I love it.

[alarm beeps]

17:55.341 --> 17:58.743
I'm a sweaty girl. Yeah!

17:58.778 --> 17:59.544
Morning.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.212
How did you sleep?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.213
Good.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.581
What's going on?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.020
[laughing]

18:09.055 --> 18:10.721
-good morning.
-Good morning.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.958
We're thinking of
going towards mahon where

18:13.977 --> 18:17.695
we can get protected water
for paddleboarding, kayaking.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.963
-All that stuff.
-All right.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.648
Hello.

18:24.687 --> 18:29.240
Gary's finger,
it's like pussing from the nail.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.843
Blegh!

18:31.878 --> 18:32.777
No.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.948
So we're going
to leave in a few minutes.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.484
You obviously are welcome to eat
breakfast whenever you want.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.818
I could be ready right now.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.553
Yeah, we can bring
up some stuff for you.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.955
Go down for break
and then come back up

18:43.990 --> 18:45.156
at, say 2:00 o'clock.

18:45.175 --> 18:46.657
-Okay.
-Let's just hope this

18:46.693 --> 18:48.693
is the only sh---weather
we get this season.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.330

18:53.349 --> 18:56.834

marni and brian's cabin please?

18:56.870 --> 18:57.935
Copy.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.104
So three people that are up

19:00.140 --> 19:01.372
are going to sit down
for breakfast now.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.041
Can I bring this stuff up?

19:04.077 --> 19:06.844
-Quite the spread.
-That's just the decoration.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.095
-Good, how are you?
-Good, thank you.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.364
Here is a vegan sausage
and vegan scrambled egg.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.634
-Oh my gosh, I'm so grateful.
-There you go.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.751
Do you want me
to start hauling?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.036
Let's do it.

19:32.055 --> 19:34.088
Yeah, let's start
picking up.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.389
<i> Hey, glenn, anchor's</i>
<i> off the bottom,</i>

19:35.425 --> 19:37.258
<i> anchor's off the bottom.</i>

19:40.046 --> 19:42.513
<i> -Anchor's home.</i>
-Copy. Thanks mate.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.984
Can I get you another
coffee or anything?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.552
Sure I'll have one more coffee.

19:48.571 --> 19:50.021
-What do you have just black?
-Just black.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.323
Good morning,
how's breakfast?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.324
-Delicious.
-Fabulous.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.559
-Insane
-awesome.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.559
I just wanted to say
good morning.

19:55.578 --> 19:56.894
Good morning, thank you.

19:56.913 --> 19:59.764
Ladies, could we get
another black coffee?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.899
Okay, thanks dais.

20:01.918 --> 20:03.584
No, sure not.
I'm glad you've actually

20:03.620 --> 20:04.835
come to terms with that.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.072
It's taking you how long?
Woo-wee!

20:08.091 --> 20:10.174
<i> Colin, colin, colin, glenn.</i>

20:10.210 --> 20:13.010
<i> I'm coming ahead to the spot</i>
<i> where I'm going to re-anchor.</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:15.713
Okay, mate, you can let it go.
Let it go.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.053
It looks like it had
a good bite.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.939
Yeah, mate, we're done.
Thank you very much.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.891
How nice is it to
be in flat water, huh?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.926
Yes, tell me about it.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.461
So I'm going to go to break.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.596
Gabriella, you're in charge.

20:32.615 --> 20:33.898
Laundry is obviously
pretty good,

20:33.933 --> 20:36.617
but just keep it turned over.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.035
-All good?
-Yeah.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.704
Thanks, girls.
Thank you.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.072
Enjoy your nap.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.810
We can take
a tender to that cove.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.411
I think it's
better swimming than here.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.080
Okay, I'll get
the tender ready

20:49.115 --> 20:51.082
and we'll get some drinks
and stuff like that ready.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.833
We're going to take
the guests just out there

20:52.885 --> 20:54.218
towards the front of the inlet

20:54.254 --> 20:57.088
so the water is a lot
nicer for them to swim.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.290
And maybe we need
a bag of drinks.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.308
Yeah.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.796
Fruit? Yeah.
I'll let chef know.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.999
I'm just going
to grab a platter.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.803
Marcos, the guests would like
a little fruit platter

21:12.822 --> 21:14.188
to take to the beach.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.973
-If you can do that.
-What time, now?

21:15.992 --> 21:19.277
Yeah. Do you want to pack
waters and a couple beers?

21:19.312 --> 21:20.111
I'll get ice.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.079
Can you use
these two small bowls?

21:22.115 --> 21:24.815
They're plastic,
it's fine for the beach.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.451
-Where are the other ones?
-I don't know.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.487
-I don't know.
-That was right there.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.656
Like the glass ones?

21:31.691 --> 21:33.007
No plastic.
No this ones broken.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.292
Okay.

21:34.327 --> 21:39.130
In the yachting industry you
have to treat your coworkers

21:39.165 --> 21:41.498
just the same when you
party and drink

21:41.517 --> 21:42.833
as you treat them at work.

21:42.852 --> 21:44.352
You don't go in hot.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.170
Sometimes you make
a lot of things about you.

21:46.189 --> 21:47.905
Tomorrow you're gonna
think about it, what you say.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.173
No, I'm not.

21:49.192 --> 21:51.709
-Yes, you are man.
-Okay, cool cool.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.110
One, no?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.445
-Or two.
-Yeah. I think one.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.481
Okay. When I have this
kind of situation,

21:57.516 --> 21:58.816
cooking is my therapy.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.652
I can get lost for hours
so I just wanna forget.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.821
I become a freaking animal.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.356
Okey dokey.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.409
-Are we going now?
-I think soon.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.331
[knocking]

22:19.472 --> 22:20.738
okay.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.739
We're going to party
like rock stars.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.374
<i> Gary, gary.</i>

22:23.393 --> 22:25.409
<i> Please let me know when</i>
<i> you're ready to take off.</i>

22:25.445 --> 22:26.844
I'm ready.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.145
Thank you, chef.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.181
Ashley. Can you please go
on a break?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.215
Copy.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.751
Might be easier standing on
that wooden piece.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.056
-Let's do this.
-Have fun.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.571
Go!

22:53.606 --> 22:54.939
[laughing]

22:59.078 --> 23:00.294
-ashley?
-Yeah.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.179
What's going on
with you and gabriella?

23:02.215 --> 23:04.014
I'm just
frustrated at this point.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.421
She's like I don't
trust any of you guys.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.390
I don't want to drink with
any of you guys anymore.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.195
I won't say anything.
Thanks for listening to me.

23:19.649 --> 23:22.099
Yeah.

23:22.118 --> 23:24.118
Like I feel like a lot's
going on behind my back

23:24.153 --> 23:27.271
which I get, but
I don't feel it's fair that

23:27.290 --> 23:30.291
I'm talking to you
without talking to her.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.377
Obviously I'm trusting you
and like I'd hope

23:33.413 --> 23:35.346
that what you're
telling me is the truth.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.047
I don't know what's going on.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.250
I don't really understand
the competitiveness

23:39.285 --> 23:42.953
with ashley about the boys,
about their jobs.

23:42.972 --> 23:44.388
About everything.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.927
We do have the same
amount of experience.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.962
This whole title of
second stew, third stew

23:51.981 --> 23:53.597
is a little obsolete
right now.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.099
I'm not ----ing stupid.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.650
It's a about
being number one.

23:56.686 --> 23:59.136
-Okay?
-Want a reese's?

23:59.155 --> 24:01.522
No, thank you.
Enjoy your break.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.157
Thanks for the chat.

24:07.345 --> 24:08.479
Woo!

24:08.514 --> 24:09.747
[laughing]

24:09.782 --> 24:11.982
are my shorts still on?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.284
That's brilliant.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.971
The two girls are still pissing
each other off.

24:17.006 --> 24:18.989
-Again?
-I think so, yeah.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.658
It's work,
it's about gary.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.644
They just don't like each other.
That's all I need.

24:23.679 --> 24:26.480
-That's crazy.
-Are we getting ready to depart?

24:26.516 --> 24:28.899
Believe so.
All crew, all crew.

24:28.935 --> 24:29.900
We're heading back
to the boat.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.168
Copy that.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.503
Is someone
down on the swim platform?

24:32.538 --> 24:34.021
Yeah, coming.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.108
Welcome back!

24:38.144 --> 24:39.343
Why aren't you sleeping?

24:39.378 --> 24:41.946
Because I was so
excited to see you guys.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.280
Can I get anyone else anything?

24:43.315 --> 24:45.649
-Clase azul?
-Yeah, absolutely.

24:45.668 --> 24:46.784
How was your excursion?

24:46.819 --> 24:47.952
It was pretty good.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.421
Thank you.

24:52.041 --> 24:53.174
-It's so weird.
-What?

24:53.209 --> 24:55.292
Just a slower charter.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.828
-Yeah, I like it though.
-They're really nice.

24:57.847 --> 24:59.029
Yeah.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.214
Are you okay, ashley?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.349
Just tired.

25:02.385 --> 25:04.501
How many hours of sleep
did you get?

25:04.520 --> 25:08.022
Like 8. It just, like,
it's catching up.

25:12.395 --> 25:14.028
I'm really trying with ashley.

25:14.063 --> 25:15.946
-You need anything?
-No, I'm okay.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.214
Thanks.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.150
I just can't.
I just can't.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.185
Let me know if
I can help you with anything.

25:22.205 --> 25:23.537
Thanks.

25:24.874 --> 25:26.207
[whines]

25:33.916 --> 25:35.266
don't do that.

25:36.719 --> 25:38.085
Marcos.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.273
You can do it.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.064
You make a vegetable broth
that's going to soak

25:50.099 --> 25:51.649
so you have flavor.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.100
You take the corn flake.

25:53.152 --> 25:56.053
This is going to be like
the chicken skin.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.355
Crispy.
----Ing crazy, bro.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.573
Cute.

25:59.609 --> 26:01.759
Can I go downstairs
and start turndowns?

26:01.794 --> 26:03.244
Yeah.

26:03.279 --> 26:05.062
You look like a beautiful
gwen stefani this evening.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.432
Whoa, that's the best thing
I've heard in my whole life.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.134
Dais, what's that beautiful
thing connected to your head?

26:10.169 --> 26:11.602
Oh, it's your body.
It's your body.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.137
What?

26:14.106 --> 26:16.040
Texture is good.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.876
Tofu's good if
you know how to make it.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.595
Oh... Holy sh--.

26:21.631 --> 26:22.963
He's a magician.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.049
I don't know how to describe it.

26:26.769 --> 26:28.585
Yeah, vegan.

26:28.604 --> 26:29.637
You ready?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.789
Oh my god. This looks beautiful.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.290
I mean, literally I love this.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.759
Wow, you guys look amazing
with the backdrop.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.261
This is perfect.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.479
Thanks for arranging
the sunset for us.

26:38.531 --> 26:39.647
You're welcome.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.534
-We're ready.
-That's what I need to hear.

26:43.569 --> 26:44.602
Vamanos!

26:44.637 --> 26:48.005
You got the middle two
and all at the same time.

26:50.293 --> 26:51.976
-You doing well?
-Oh my god.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.144
We have a saffron
asparagus risotto.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.798
Yours, I cook it
with vegan butter.

26:57.833 --> 26:58.916
Vegan butter?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.217
You eat it at home
all the time.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.418
I know I do.
I know.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.988
-I love vegan butter.
-So good.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.123
I'm gonna cook this.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.810
-How's everything?
-That was wonderful.

27:09.845 --> 27:13.464
Good. It looks like
everyone's finished.

27:15.318 --> 27:16.333
That's starters cleared.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.319
Damn, they're eating fast.

27:18.354 --> 27:19.687
You guys go with this.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.338
Yes, ashley, you can come
with us as well.

27:21.374 --> 27:25.576
This is dover sole
with clams and mussels,

27:25.611 --> 27:27.277
-paprika sauce.
-And what's this?

27:27.312 --> 27:29.513
-Fried chicken.
-Okay.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.498
-Thank you.
-Oh my goodness.

27:31.534 --> 27:33.751
So just to let
you know that you have

27:33.786 --> 27:35.486
-got vegan fried chicken.
-Thank you.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.186
You're welcome.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.989
Oh, that makes me so excited.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.591
How's the fried chicken?

27:40.626 --> 27:43.160
It's like crispy,
it's beautiful.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.327
Rinse the whole boat.

27:44.347 --> 27:45.846
-Okay.
-Cool.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.664
-Cool beans, dude.
-I'll see you in the morning.

27:47.683 --> 27:49.049
[bleep], I know I'm forgetting
to tell you something

27:49.101 --> 27:50.500
and I don't know what it is.

27:50.519 --> 27:52.553
You know if glenn's
found somebody yet?

27:52.605 --> 27:54.337
I believe glenn said
after this charter,

27:54.357 --> 27:56.523
so he'll probably come
tomorrow or the next day.

27:56.559 --> 27:57.341
Okay.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.226
I hope they have
a good personality

27:59.278 --> 28:00.477
and they're a hard worker.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.279
I hope they can make me laugh

28:02.314 --> 28:04.698
and then I hope they're hot,
but that's third on the list.

28:04.734 --> 28:07.151
I'm going to bed.
Yeah, I'll see you at 6.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.619
You want a strawberry shot.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.520
Yeah, because what
I'm doing is like

28:10.539 --> 28:13.540
a kiwi strawberry spaghetti,
you know.

28:13.576 --> 28:16.543
Gabriella, we need a
strawberry shot for dessert.

28:16.579 --> 28:17.494
Okay.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.329
-When did you go vegan?
-Three years ago.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.215
I could
be full on vegetarian.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.467
I could actually eat
that fried chicken.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.718
Hands down, best food
in my entire life.

28:24.754 --> 28:26.637
Should we all be sober
tomorrow night?

28:26.672 --> 28:27.755
Nope.

28:27.807 --> 28:28.756
Gabriella...

28:34.379 --> 28:36.280
Gonna start to make
my way up the stairs.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.765
[bleep] this.

28:37.817 --> 28:38.916
Where's daisy?

28:38.951 --> 28:41.819
Wow, this looks amazing.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.103
What do we have?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.239
Strawberry three ways.

28:45.274 --> 28:47.091
We have spaghetti strawberry
with kiwi,

28:47.126 --> 28:48.725
-white chocolate chips
-so good.

28:48.744 --> 28:51.245
In the middle,
we have vodka strawberry shot

28:51.280 --> 28:53.063
and then we have
strawberry ravioli

28:53.082 --> 28:55.749
with passion fruit and mint.

28:55.785 --> 28:56.934
-Cheers.
-All right guys.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.919
I'm very happy
that you guys love it.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.287
Adios!

29:00.339 --> 29:01.939
-Thank you.
-Bravo.

29:01.974 --> 29:02.940
Thank you, thank you for real.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.258
Appreciate it guys.

29:04.293 --> 29:05.943
I think I like
the last one the best.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.211
I know it.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.762
-Yeah
-because you love passion fruit.

29:08.798 --> 29:10.431
It's only 10:00.

29:10.466 --> 29:11.799
I know.
It's 11.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.635
You should get up early.
We're super boring.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.419
-Yeah, for sure.
-I know, I know.

29:16.439 --> 29:18.222
<i> Ashley, ashley.</i>
<i> Gabriella.</i>

29:18.257 --> 29:19.523
Go ahead.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.892
I don't need you so you
can go to bed

29:21.927 --> 29:24.645
if you're finished
with your laundry.

29:24.697 --> 29:25.562
<i> Copy.</i>

29:25.597 --> 29:27.765
-Well, that was fun.
-That was so fun.

29:31.003 --> 29:31.969
Goodnight, dais.

29:32.004 --> 29:32.970
Night.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.337
Do you have time to talk?

29:34.356 --> 29:35.606
I don't feel comfortable
to talk to anyone else.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.457
I can chat.

29:36.492 --> 29:38.909
All right man,
see you in the morning.

29:38.944 --> 29:43.180
So you know I'm tired and
I had a really bad day today.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.581
I've had a couple
chats with ashley,

29:44.616 --> 29:47.450
but then something is weird
about it.

29:47.470 --> 29:50.787
Like I'm not being...
Respected.

29:50.806 --> 29:51.688
Yeah.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.423
The way I'm respecting
other people.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.959
And I don't feel
a part of the team.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.179
It's really hard for me
to respect people off the clock

29:59.231 --> 30:02.516
when we're getting loose
and it's negatively affected.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.352
My way to mesh with this crew.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.637
I already know
that ashley hates me.

30:07.656 --> 30:10.473
Marcos will not
give me the time of day.

30:10.493 --> 30:12.276
I can't get a read on daisy.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.610
I don't know what to do.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.512
And I think you're
on the right track

30:15.548 --> 30:18.615
of just being aware
and wanting to improve.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.984
While you want to develop those
friendships with everyone,

30:21.020 --> 30:23.203
there's also a level
of professionalism

30:23.255 --> 30:24.321
with just coexisting.

30:24.340 --> 30:26.006
-Yeah.
-Because we wear

30:26.041 --> 30:27.674
so many hats on this boat.

30:27.710 --> 30:30.344
Maybe I'm more
sensitive than I was,

30:30.379 --> 30:32.012
you know, a year ago when
I first joined.

30:32.047 --> 30:35.498
I don't think... You're
in the gutter though.

30:35.518 --> 30:39.853
I think, personally...
Fresh start, move forward,

30:39.889 --> 30:41.688
don't dwell on
the negative energy

30:41.724 --> 30:44.024
and make the most out of
the time you have left there.

30:44.059 --> 30:48.028
If you think about it, you
still have half the time left.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.730
Thanks, kelsey.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.867
Don't cry.
You're a good sister.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.583
Oh, sh--.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.419
Pretty much all of this in
the cockpit are shammied.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.755
Do you want to go on a break,
then?

31:14.790 --> 31:16.423
I'll set my
alarm for 11.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.511
Morning.

31:22.681 --> 31:23.981
Good morning.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.048
So what are you going
to drink tonight?

31:29.188 --> 31:31.688
-I will watch you.
-I'm not going to go crazy.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.427
Nighty night.

31:37.446 --> 31:39.396
-Morning, ladies.
-Morning, glenn.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.465
I'm fine, everything's fine,
I can do this.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.783
-Morning.
-Morning. How are you?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.318
Good.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.802
We're thinking
about going out for a sail.

31:45.838 --> 31:46.803
There's a little bit
of wind.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.372
-Cool.
-How are you?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.040
-I'm good. How are you?
-I'm good. Thank you.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.792
Yeah, can I get
you anything to drink?

31:51.827 --> 31:53.043
-I'll do ice tea, please.
-Yeah, of course.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.511
Thank you.

31:54.546 --> 31:58.131
Dais, we'll fire up
soon and head out.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.283
Two of them are up.

32:00.302 --> 32:01.785
Maybe the others will get up

32:01.820 --> 32:04.221
and you have a little
bit of time to for them to eat.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.757
Won't take long to
clear that though, right?

32:06.792 --> 32:10.310
Yeah, I mean no, but
we still have to put sh-- away.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.496
Is there anything in
here you guys can stow?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.353
But we will wanna go, so...

32:19.405 --> 32:22.406
How much time do you need?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.693
10 minutes? 15 minutes?

32:26.745 --> 32:30.831
Till we can actually
get sails up and heel over.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.717
20, so 15 in a pinch?

32:33.752 --> 32:36.420
You could stick stuff in the
sink or something, right?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.856
I'd like to give these guys
a little sail.

32:39.892 --> 32:43.210
The guys are putting the
nautibuoys away.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.494
-Two of them are up.
-Two are up.

32:44.513 --> 32:46.213
-Yeah.
-That's still four more.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.848
We can't not sail.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.217
We gotta find a way to do it.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.718
End of story.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.687
You do you glenn, but I can
only do what I can do.

32:53.722 --> 32:57.007
I know but I wanna,
wanna, you know.

32:57.026 --> 32:58.392
You do you.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.243
We're gonna get going
in a few minutes.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.244
We gotta hop.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.246
Glenn wants to go sailing.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.065
Start picking up.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.851
It's 12 knots now and it's going
to be more outside the harbor.

33:07.870 --> 33:09.069
We're going to heel hard.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.487
Oh, they have to eat now.

33:10.522 --> 33:11.738
I'll go and ask them do
they want breakfast

33:11.790 --> 33:12.873
because we're about
to go sail--

33:12.908 --> 33:14.858
I'm in such a bad mood.

33:14.877 --> 33:16.326
Good morning!

33:16.361 --> 33:17.761
We're gonna start
sailing in a few minutes.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.379
Dang, they're already
packing and everything.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.831
Yeah, I was just gonna put
everything on the floor.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.082
And just pull them up.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.767
That seems logical.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.303
-Anchor's in.
<i> -Copy that, mate.</i>

33:26.338 --> 33:28.872
Ready for breakfast? Or do
you want a few minutes?

33:28.907 --> 33:31.675
Dais... I'm thinking
of getting sails up

33:31.710 --> 33:33.577
as soon as we get
out the entrance here.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.079
If there's a way we can.

33:36.115 --> 33:41.485
Okay, should I do breakfast
to order or I don't...

33:41.520 --> 33:43.653
-Do you guys?
-We don't have to sail.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.155
-No, we want to sail.
-I'd prefer to sail than...

33:45.190 --> 33:46.423
-We can wait to eat.
-Are you hungry?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.791
I can do like
something in your hands.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.243
We'll have sails up
in about 15 minutes.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.896
Oh why don't we just eat
quickly and then we'll be done.

33:52.915 --> 33:54.114
Okay, let's do that.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.450
This is a disaster
waiting to happen.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.118
Whatever you guys want.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.836
Gabriella, daisy.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.621
Would you mind coming up and
helping with breakfast, please?

34:01.673 --> 34:02.939
Sure.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.377
We're putting up sails
in 15 minutes while they eat,

34:07.413 --> 34:09.796
and then that gives me
0 seconds to clean up.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.751
Good morning, crew.
Hi.

34:14.787 --> 34:17.254
Put the plate
of meat right by dawn.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.259
These are vegan crepes.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.228
Thank you.
Wow.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.430
This is so good.

34:27.449 --> 34:30.266
This is going to flow away.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.669
Is anyone having
like granola and yogurt?

34:32.704 --> 34:34.955
If not, they can probably
take that stuff, right?

34:34.990 --> 34:36.973
You wanna like start
bringing stuff in case we...

34:37.009 --> 34:39.976
Start heeling over?
Yeah, it's imminent.

34:40.012 --> 34:42.646
Let's slow down
start heading up into it.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.965
-Daisy, daisy, glenn.
-Go ahead, glenn.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.084
We're going to slow down and
start putting sails up

34:47.119 --> 34:50.420
so you've got about another 10
minutes before we start heeling.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.556
-Is that cool?
-We'll do our best.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.974
We have to
take everything right?

34:54.009 --> 34:55.792
Well, yeah, it's...
We're gonna heel hard.

34:55.828 --> 34:56.793
It's 13 knots.

34:56.812 --> 34:57.627
Oh, sh--.

34:57.663 --> 34:58.962
Okay, I'm going to
start going up.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.850
Does anyone want anymore fruit
before I take it down?

35:03.902 --> 35:06.236
-Great, thank you.
-You're welcome.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.971
Okay, copy.

35:07.990 --> 35:09.990
If you're ready, we'll
start getting up the main, too.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.245
-Should go up top?
-Yeah.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.581
Yeah, that's good.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.381
Whoa.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.983
Sails are going up.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.952
<i> Daisy, are you guys ready?</i>
<i> We're going to...</i>

35:21.987 --> 35:23.920
<i> We've got sails up now,</i>
<i> we're going to start heeling.</i>

35:25.791 --> 35:27.958
Copy, yeah, you can go ahead.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.344
You guys are good?
We can go ahead.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.882
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Thank you.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.884
Gary, can you call trim
on the genoa?

35:37.936 --> 35:39.336
Yeah, keep going.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.221
Here we ----ing go.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.274
Yeah, do a hard turn to get us
through it as quick as possible.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.411
-It's crazy!
-I love it.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.746
I got it.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.348
You can call me
spiderman after this.

35:52.818 --> 35:56.186
I don't even think
a picture could do this justice.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.021
[clattering]

35:58.056 --> 35:59.623
[bleep]

36:02.244 --> 36:03.376
sh--.

36:03.412 --> 36:04.794
What the [bleep] was all that?

36:06.798 --> 36:10.050
Gary, can you
help these guys inside?

36:10.085 --> 36:11.301
It's okay, I've got it.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.054
-Are we gonna be tacking?
-100%.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.057
Whenever you want
to tack, go for it, mate.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.975
Careful, marni.

36:19.011 --> 36:21.011
Oh my god.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.008
We are really heeling now.

36:35.043 --> 36:36.376
This is incredible.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.761
We're underwater.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.382
Are you kidding me?
Are we upside down?

36:42.434 --> 36:45.569
Seriously...

36:45.604 --> 36:46.887
Keep turning down until
we get it behind us.

36:46.939 --> 36:47.938
Yeah.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.239
----Ing joke.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.740
[singing in spanish]

36:52.978 --> 36:54.277
ah!

36:54.313 --> 36:56.213
I try to put myself
in a better mood.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.648
Maybe you need a hug from gary.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.568
No, he definitely gets
way too many hugs from me.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.570
Amazing.
You getting some video of this?

37:03.622 --> 37:06.356
-Crazy.
-It's beautiful.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.824
Is that considered a steep heel?

37:07.859 --> 37:09.025
Not the steepest I've ever seen,

37:09.061 --> 37:10.227
but is pretty steep.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.495
-But for amateurs like us?
-Yeah.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.830
Do it again.
Do it again.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.966
-Alright, come on, jay.
-What, we gotta go pack?

37:16.001 --> 37:17.867
-Yeah.
-No.

37:17.886 --> 37:19.586
Okay, I think we'll start
putting this away.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.771
As soon as we're past this mark
you can watch the mizzen

37:21.807 --> 37:23.039
and he can watch the main.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.258
[sniffs]

37:25.310 --> 37:26.443
that was a good sail.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.949
These are yours.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.067
Thank you.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.620
It was okay until...

37:36.655 --> 37:37.821
You roll out of bed?

37:37.856 --> 37:38.688
Yeah.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.074
-Did you really?
-No.

37:41.109 --> 37:43.443
Interior, interior,
can we get somebody topsides

37:43.495 --> 37:44.861
and get the fenders out?

37:44.896 --> 37:47.247
Yep, yep. Yep.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:47.282 --> 37:49.582
All right, kels, we're just
going to pull out the fenders.

37:49.618 --> 37:51.084
Are these heavy to pull out?

37:51.119 --> 37:52.786
They're not heavy,
they're just awkward,

37:52.838 --> 37:54.671
and then glenn doesn't
want us to drag them.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.641
<i> Okay, gary, I'm gonna</i>
<i> start my spin in a second.</i>

37:57.676 --> 37:59.643
It's insane.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.847
Put it a touch
forward half a meter.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.715
That's good, that's good.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.083
There, that's good.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.386
Okay, gary,
let's get a stern line on.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.722
That's main engine off.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.125
All crew, let's get everybody
on the dock please.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.977
Okay.
'til we meet again.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.429
Gabriela could be first.
Girls first boys.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.797
We're gonna miss you guys.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.132
Thank you so
much for everything.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.433
See you again.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.934
You guys are amazing.

38:24.953 --> 38:27.120
I want to say thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

38:27.155 --> 38:30.123
We appreciate everything
from the fun water sports

38:30.158 --> 38:34.411
and this morning's
sail was just spectacular.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.414
-That, too.
-Thank you very much.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.382
We'll miss you.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.383
-Thank you.
-Bye.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.584
Bye, guys.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.121
You're such a pest.

38:45.140 --> 38:46.489
[ship horn blows]

38:49.678 --> 38:51.461
-all right guys.
-Thank you.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.296
[bleep]

38:53.332 --> 38:55.432
one more charter down.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.168
-Try to contain yourself.
-I just got carried away.

38:58.203 --> 39:01.538
Want to start the bunny pad and
then start covering up cushions?

39:03.108 --> 39:08.078
Can everybody meet me in
the saloon for a tip meeting?

39:15.187 --> 39:16.169
Hello.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.123
Charter number 5.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.392
So we're... We're more
than halfway through the season.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.961
Great job. Means a great
deal that you guys are keeping

39:24.996 --> 39:26.996
these guests happy
even when we're short

39:27.032 --> 39:29.182
a couple hands
and maybe a finger.

39:29.217 --> 39:30.433
Yeah.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.885
So there is
a little bit of update

39:31.937 --> 39:33.553
regarding our new deckhand.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.605
They should be here
on board before

39:35.640 --> 39:36.723
we pick up the next charter.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.642
Check all the girl's smile.

39:39.678 --> 39:43.313
So now for the tip,
the total is 20,000.

39:43.348 --> 39:44.314
-[bleep]
-wow.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.815
Wow.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.318
Per person
works out to 2500.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.403
Oh yeah.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.872
Oh, sh--!

39:52.908 --> 39:54.491
[bleep], almost fell
off my chair there.

39:54.526 --> 39:57.693
Tonight, you guys are gonna
head out for a nice dinner,

39:57.712 --> 40:01.548
but I recommend
keeping it low key because

40:01.583 --> 40:02.966
tomorrow you have the day off.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.901
[cheering]

40:04.936 --> 40:08.471
I've secured a local villa
for you guys to use

40:08.507 --> 40:12.575
and have some much deserved
downtime and just have some fun.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.061
Thank you for organizing that.

40:15.097 --> 40:16.646
Thank you very much.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.581
[laughing]

40:18.617 --> 40:20.483
I need this recharge.
I need this reset.

40:20.519 --> 40:23.186
I do need to get out of my head
and this is the perfect way

40:23.221 --> 40:24.187
to do it.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.189
I am ----ing crumbling here.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.257
Cheers.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.458
Well, done great charter.

40:28.493 --> 40:31.394
Thank you very much.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.729
-Gabriella?
-Yes.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.731
-How are you getting on?
-Okay.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.535
Yeah for sure.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.922
I want to be
an extension of you.

40:42.958 --> 40:44.924
I want you to be able
to trust me and rely on me

40:44.960 --> 40:47.043
and I feel like I was
doing that in the beginning.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.711
But with the rocks
that we've had

40:48.746 --> 40:51.014
with personality differences,
I feel like

40:51.049 --> 40:55.218
I've lost some of your trust
and some of the other hods.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.803
This isn't fun for me

40:56.855 --> 40:59.189
and I don't want to
drag anyone else down either.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.590
I feel defeated.

41:00.609 --> 41:02.659
-First of all...
-Yeah.

41:02.694 --> 41:03.793
You're a great stew.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.161
The guests love you.

41:05.197 --> 41:09.232
You are excellent at service,
table decor.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.836
When you want to bring
good energy,

41:12.871 --> 41:14.771
you bring great energy.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.539
-Yeah.
-I want you here.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.174
Glenn wants you here.

41:18.210 --> 41:22.462
You have incredible potential,
but you have to want to be here.

41:22.497 --> 41:23.830
Thank you.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.798
Not that this is
what I wanted to happen,

41:25.834 --> 41:28.918
but with the ashley stuff
I feel dismissed sometimes

41:28.953 --> 41:31.054
-and I did take it personally.
-Yeah.

41:31.089 --> 41:34.474
I wasn't coming
to you with my initial things

41:34.509 --> 41:38.678
I was noticing and because
of me and things I've done,

41:38.730 --> 41:40.313
it sent me into
a downward spiral,

41:40.348 --> 41:43.566
so I'm trying really, really
hard to pull myself out of it.

41:43.602 --> 41:46.186
But ----ing mental
gymnastics for me.

41:46.238 --> 41:49.072
If you ever wanted to come and
talk to me, [bleep] man,

41:49.107 --> 41:50.190
take a coffee.

41:50.242 --> 41:51.107
We go up in the bow.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.610
Don't let things consume
you because...

41:53.645 --> 41:55.745
Yeah. This is the result.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.680
This is the result.

41:57.716 --> 41:58.915
-Okay?
-Thanks, daisy.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.250
You're awesome.

42:00.285 --> 42:04.153
I'm just going to
work on myself

42:04.172 --> 42:07.323
because I feel like
complete sh--, to be honest.

42:07.342 --> 42:10.793
Oh my god.

42:10.828 --> 42:14.547
Oh, I am emotionally drained.

42:14.599 --> 42:17.217
I'm just so burned out.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.106
Next on "below
deck sailing yacht"...

42:23.141 --> 42:24.274
We're here.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.576
Yeah, baby.

42:26.611 --> 42:28.378
Yes!

42:28.413 --> 42:31.581
He might accidentally sleep with
every girl on this boat.

42:31.616 --> 42:32.815
This is trouble.

42:33.685 --> 42:34.851
To gabriella.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.153
To new beginnings
fresh starts.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.022
No, no.

42:40.041 --> 42:41.691
That's not cool man.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.930
That's your problem, not mine.

42:46.965 --> 42:49.632
I can't have my chef
and my stew not talking.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.101
-Hey glenn, can I talk to you?
-Sure.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.174
Take a moment.
