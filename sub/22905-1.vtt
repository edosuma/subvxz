00:26.057 --> 00:28.926
Dude,
first day of high school.

00:28.928 --> 00:30.961
Oh, you are so lucky.

00:30.963 --> 00:33.063
What I'd give to go back
and do it all again,

00:33.065 --> 00:35.432
exactly the same way.

00:35.434 --> 00:36.767
Star quarterback,

00:36.769 --> 00:38.135
- prom king...
- Prom king.

00:38.137 --> 00:39.303
Class vice-president.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.938
All the glory, none of
the responsibility.

00:41.940 --> 00:44.043
I know, Dad. I've heard it
a thousand times.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.209
Remember what I told you.

00:46.211 --> 00:47.277
Be popular.

00:47.279 --> 00:48.344
It's the best.

00:48.346 --> 00:49.913
Check. Whatever.

00:49.915 --> 00:50.847
Don't forget that.

00:50.849 --> 00:52.551
See you tonight.

01:05.063 --> 01:05.995
Ready?

01:05.997 --> 01:07.466
As I'll ever be.

01:11.403 --> 01:12.539
Cole.

01:13.772 --> 01:16.042
Stop trying to peek at
Maddy's nipples.

01:16.875 --> 01:18.477
Oh, my God! Dad!

01:19.712 --> 01:21.177
Sorry about that.

01:21.179 --> 01:23.147
He doesn't know
he's an adult.

01:24.816 --> 01:25.915
You wanna race?

01:25.917 --> 01:28.321
Nah. Not today.

01:29.455 --> 01:30.390
Afraid you'll lose?

01:30.789 --> 01:32.456
Ha!

01:32.458 --> 01:33.724
Yeah, you're right.

01:33.726 --> 01:37.828
'Cause I mean, boys are just
so much faster and stronger.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.366
And total suckers.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.432
Thanks for the headstart.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.766
Oh, shit.

01:42.768 --> 01:44.367
Incoming freshman
Maddy Dadner

01:44.369 --> 01:47.539
is on point to finally beat
her arch rival Cole Reed.

01:48.974 --> 01:50.342
And the crowd goes wild.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.180
I don't want people to think
I'm a loser.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.948
Worse case
you always have me.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.782
At school and next door.

01:59.784 --> 02:01.220
- True.
- Oh, hey. Hold on.

02:08.526 --> 02:09.863
Whoa!

02:10.729 --> 02:11.598
Thanks.

02:17.168 --> 02:19.937
But, uh, do you really think
high school's gonna be

02:19.939 --> 02:21.141
all that different
from middle school?

02:21.540 --> 02:22.806
Probably not.

02:22.808 --> 02:25.109
It's all the same kids we've
known since kindergarten.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.480
How much could people really
change in three months?

02:46.999 --> 02:48.468
Go on, I'll meet you
at class.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.203
Oh, okay.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.037
What's up, bro!

02:57.676 --> 02:59.379
Look at those
tighty whiteys.

03:00.011 --> 03:01.547
Nice to meet you, tiny.

03:12.524 --> 03:14.059
Guess who got
a new nickname.

03:24.602 --> 03:25.872
What's up, Tighty?

03:26.571 --> 03:29.338
Ooh, Tighty.
Fantastic, baby.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.510
Keeping it clean, Tighty?

03:35.848 --> 03:37.247
Hey, Tighty.

03:37.249 --> 03:39.116
You think you're fooling people
with those headphones,

03:39.118 --> 03:41.418
but I know you've been
listening and keeping track

03:41.420 --> 03:43.287
of how many times
you've been called Tighty,

03:43.289 --> 03:45.825
because you're totally lame and
obsessed with your shitty nickname.

03:46.659 --> 03:47.858
Good morning, City.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.392
The only thing
"good" about this morning

03:49.394 --> 03:51.463
is that it's one day closer
to graduation.

03:53.165 --> 03:54.034
Oh, no.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.900
You are an inspiration.

03:56.902 --> 03:58.602
The M&Ms are goddesses.

03:58.604 --> 04:01.604
The M&Ms are called that because their
first names are Maddy and Marissa,

04:01.606 --> 04:03.042
which starts with an "M".

04:15.220 --> 04:16.456
Sup, Stuffs?

04:17.723 --> 04:19.925
Come on, Maddy. G2G.

04:21.459 --> 04:24.394
It's Stufts, with a "T".

04:24.396 --> 04:25.564
Not "stuffs".

04:26.699 --> 04:28.264
Why do you even
try anymore.

04:28.266 --> 04:30.067
You know they don't
listen to you.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.634
It's the principle
of the thing.

04:37.977 --> 04:39.709
Principal Statszill here.

04:39.711 --> 04:41.745
Welcoming all you
sexy young things

04:41.747 --> 04:43.045
back from spring break.

04:43.047 --> 04:44.680
<i>Prom is just
around the corner.</i>

04:44.682 --> 04:46.550
<i>Don't wait to find a date.</i>

04:46.552 --> 04:50.286
<i>The last thing you want is to squander
the greatest night of your young life</i>

04:50.288 --> 04:53.259
on some third tier loser
from AP Cal.

04:54.292 --> 04:57.326
So consider this your
official "save the date"

04:57.328 --> 05:00.797
<i>for May 17th,
the night of the big "P".</i>

05:00.799 --> 05:02.232
<i>Prom, that is.</i>

05:02.234 --> 05:03.233
<i>Good day.</i>

05:06.605 --> 05:07.838
Alrighty, then.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.976
Group study time.
Pair up, pair, up, pair up.

05:12.744 --> 05:14.310
Tig.

05:14.312 --> 05:16.413
Tig. Tig.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.387
Eat a bowl of dicks!

05:23.021 --> 05:25.189
Could you please focus on
something other than

05:25.191 --> 05:27.624
making your peers
hate themselves?

05:27.626 --> 05:29.158
Now go ahead and
take out your phones

05:29.160 --> 05:31.230
and use them in ways your parents
and I will never understand.

05:34.432 --> 05:35.601
Well, what do we have...

05:36.100 --> 05:37.167
Come on!

05:37.169 --> 05:39.235
You can't hide your drawings
from me forever.

05:39.237 --> 05:41.071
Only until they're finished.

05:41.073 --> 05:43.206
When's that? 2047?

05:43.208 --> 05:44.507
May 17th.

05:44.509 --> 05:46.310
The art school I've applied to
is hosting a gallery night,

05:46.312 --> 05:48.177
and that's where I'll
show my drawings.

05:48.179 --> 05:50.413
That is the best
news ever.

05:50.415 --> 05:53.285
Thank you for officially giving
me a reason to miss prom.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.954
Hey, guess what I'm doing
on May 17th.

05:57.956 --> 05:59.689
Um, nobody cares.

05:59.691 --> 06:01.190
I'm going to Cole's art show

06:01.192 --> 06:03.128
and everyone else
can suck it.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.831
Freak.

06:06.564 --> 06:09.334
Oh. What do we have here?

06:09.867 --> 06:11.535
Cole on Instagram.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.769
And where is he at?

06:12.771 --> 06:15.175
Oh, of course.
Maddy Dadner's feed.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.510
It's just for inspiration.

06:18.343 --> 06:19.810
From Maddy's feed?

06:19.812 --> 06:22.980
Why can't you pick one of the other
16 billion girls on Instagram?

06:22.982 --> 06:26.016
Come on. Everyone is
on her feed.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.451
Did you guys see Maddy's
eyebrows from last weekend?

06:28.453 --> 06:30.055
Oh! On fleek.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.422
There's a very
specific reason

06:32.424 --> 06:34.992
why she has the most followers
in the entire school.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.026
Because no one's monitoring
pervy old dudes

06:37.028 --> 06:38.327
who don't want to
pay for porn.

06:38.329 --> 06:39.295
Sad but true.

06:39.297 --> 06:41.367
But it is also
because of her hair.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.699
<i>Every day
since freshman year,</i>

06:43.701 --> 06:45.002
<i>Maddy's had
a different hairstyle</i>

06:45.004 --> 06:46.472
<i>and posted a photo
of every single one.</i>

06:49.107 --> 06:50.673
Stalker.

06:50.675 --> 06:52.908
Even you can't resist
the M&M's.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.644
The M&M's are
an inspiration.

06:54.646 --> 06:56.178
The M&M's are goddesses.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.115
- The M&M's are...
- Not even here right now.

06:59.117 --> 07:01.018
What is wrong with
all of you?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.653
Like you're innocent.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.754
I know you still talk to
Maddy sometimes.

07:04.756 --> 07:07.189
Yeah.
And I self loathe for it.

07:07.191 --> 07:08.759
I look at myself
in the mirror and say,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.830
"Stupid bitch,
she stole your boyfriend."

07:15.533 --> 07:17.434
I am running up
lines for a play.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.935
Oh. Oh, yeah.

07:19.937 --> 07:21.940
I know that play, okay?

07:22.441 --> 07:23.810
I live that play.

07:30.949 --> 07:33.617
<i> Charles
Adams may not have been accepted by</i>

07:33.619 --> 07:35.584
<i>his presidential
father, John,</i>

07:35.586 --> 07:37.420
<i>but you can find acceptance</i>

07:37.422 --> 07:39.024
<i>by fitting in.</i>

07:41.526 --> 07:43.894
Tighty and Stuffs.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.398
That's a match
made in heaven.

07:45.963 --> 07:48.834
It's "Stufts" with a "T".

07:49.434 --> 07:50.435
Idiot.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.408
Hi, Maddy.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.410
Oh, my God. Your hair
looks great today, Maddy.

08:01.513 --> 08:03.413
I can't believe we
used to be friends with them.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.115
Wish I'd never met
a single one of them.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.850
In a way I used to be them,

08:06.852 --> 08:08.218
so there is a one.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.886
Easy with the riddles,
Master Baggins.

08:10.888 --> 08:13.055
Actually, if you were
still a "them",

08:13.057 --> 08:14.790
we wouldn't be friends.

08:14.792 --> 08:17.326
Can we please not bring up the incident
that brought us together, Tighty?

08:17.328 --> 08:19.896
We've rehashed that one
enough to make a breakfast.

08:19.898 --> 08:20.997
And a second breakfast.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.535
- Or elevenses.
- You need to stop that.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.903
What do you think
about this one?

08:26.905 --> 08:29.072
I feel like it captures
the essence of high school.

08:29.074 --> 08:31.576
Sports, winning,
Kane and I.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.913
IDK.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.015
Well, what about...

08:36.414 --> 08:38.914
this one?

08:38.916 --> 08:41.485
Shouldn't we use photos
of, like, the whole squad,

08:41.486 --> 08:42.652
not just you and Kane?

08:42.654 --> 08:43.953
Well, sure.
But we discussed having

08:43.955 --> 08:46.022
an aspirational power couple
pic of Kane and I.

08:46.024 --> 08:48.091
I just have to find
the best one.

08:48.093 --> 08:49.658
Why don't we just do
a collage of your hair pics

08:49.660 --> 08:50.929
and call it a day?

08:51.863 --> 08:53.296
Marissa, are you riled?

08:53.298 --> 08:54.530
No.

08:54.532 --> 08:56.298
But if you could stop being
a selfish pigeon for one sec,

08:56.300 --> 08:57.234
that would be great.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.436
Did you just call me
a pidge?

08:59.438 --> 09:00.573
So what if I did?

09:06.210 --> 09:07.979
How dare you?

09:13.117 --> 09:15.454
Come on. You know I would
never betray you like that.

09:17.054 --> 09:18.587
Go with the football pic.

09:18.589 --> 09:19.789
It's more iconic.

09:19.791 --> 09:20.992
Like a Taylor Swift song.

09:21.593 --> 09:23.029
Oh, you're so right.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.428
Now onto the group shots.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.030
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Be right back

09:28.032 --> 09:29.000
Wow.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.499
What?

09:30.501 --> 09:32.201
Marissa, I'm so impressed.

09:32.203 --> 09:33.205
No abbreviation.

09:33.838 --> 09:35.241
Laughing out loud.

09:43.748 --> 09:45.317
She needs to take this.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.923
Hey, M, you forgot your...

09:52.690 --> 09:54.526
You pidge!

09:55.861 --> 09:57.427
Maddy, it's not what
it looks like.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.830
So it's not my boyfriend
and best friend making out,

09:59.832 --> 10:01.534
but rather some optical
illusion of that?

10:03.801 --> 10:05.504
Well, if you believe that,
then, yes.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.003
Oh, my God.

10:07.005 --> 10:09.272
You? I can't even...
This...

10:09.274 --> 10:11.173
Yeah, Maddy.
You're right.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.174
Oh, fuck it.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.445
It's not what it
looks like.

10:16.548 --> 10:18.117
Mm.

10:20.285 --> 10:21.353
Believe it.

10:33.332 --> 10:34.567
Maddy, what's wrong?

10:35.132 --> 10:36.168
Nothing.

10:37.502 --> 10:38.969
Everything.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.471
Kane didn't do something
without consent, did he?

10:41.473 --> 10:43.208
- What?
- No.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.342
I mean, yeah, he did.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.677
Oh, not my baby!

10:47.679 --> 10:48.979
- Oh, gosh!
- Not my baby!

10:48.981 --> 10:51.380
- Call the police.
- It's not like that.

10:51.382 --> 10:52.982
Thank God.

10:52.984 --> 10:54.985
Confrontation remains
a challenge for me.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.385
That and dairy.

10:56.387 --> 10:58.120
I hate high school.

10:58.122 --> 11:00.258
I just want it to be over.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.692
Whoa. Really?

11:02.694 --> 11:03.994
But...

11:03.996 --> 11:05.629
Honey, honey. Listen.
I wanna tell you something.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.397
Your father and I,
we can relate.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.532
Our high school years,

11:08.534 --> 11:11.033
they were pretty much
the equivalent of being

11:11.035 --> 11:13.370
locked in
an emotional prison

11:13.372 --> 11:14.937
of constant ridicule

11:14.939 --> 11:16.206
and torture.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.575
Your father got the living
crap kicked out of him

11:18.577 --> 11:19.975
on a daily basis.

11:19.977 --> 11:22.778
And I was called
a greasy headed troll.

11:22.780 --> 11:25.414
Everything happens
for a good reason.

11:25.416 --> 11:26.816
Even though it may feel

11:26.818 --> 11:29.554
horribly humiliating
and punishing and cruel.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.453
At... At the time.

11:31.455 --> 11:32.991
I don't like it.

11:36.093 --> 11:39.162
I never thought that perfect
popular kids in school

11:39.164 --> 11:41.331
had anything to get
this upset about.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.434
Well...

11:44.136 --> 11:45.872
Maybe she's not
that popular.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.343
Oh, no, honey.
Your father didn't mean it.

11:50.775 --> 11:51.910
Honey...

11:52.209 --> 11:53.245
I...

11:54.011 --> 11:55.448
We're bad parents.

11:55.948 --> 11:56.980
Ditto to that.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.523
What's up!

12:07.525 --> 12:08.991
Jesus!

12:08.993 --> 12:11.027
Why can't you just
pop your head in

12:11.029 --> 12:13.663
and ask me how my day was,
like any other human father?

12:13.665 --> 12:14.764
So it was lame, huh?

12:14.766 --> 12:16.332
No, it was fine.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.601
I'm guessing you still don't
have a date for the prom.

12:18.603 --> 12:19.836
You know my art show
is that night.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.905
Ugh! Art is boring!

12:22.907 --> 12:24.607
Prom is about sex.

12:24.609 --> 12:26.845
Sex is exciting.

12:30.147 --> 12:32.581
Look, I know you're kind
of a weirdo,

12:32.583 --> 12:34.017
and getting laid
before graduation

12:34.019 --> 12:36.186
is kind of a pipe dream.
But...

12:36.188 --> 12:37.988
Maybe there's some
girl out there

12:37.990 --> 12:39.221
who's weird just like you,

12:39.223 --> 12:41.860
that's down to clown
on prom night.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.528
What a classy male
role model I have.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.297
What do you want
from me, Cole?

12:47.299 --> 12:48.764
I was prom king.

12:48.766 --> 12:49.966
I ruled over a night

12:49.968 --> 12:52.168
where dozens of virginities
were laid to rest.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.538
I think I want a DNA test
for my graduation present.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.740
Forget it.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.276
You're stuck with me
for life.

12:58.876 --> 13:01.244
Ugh! Dad, come on!

13:10.655 --> 13:12.054
I know
this is inappropriate,

13:12.056 --> 13:14.526
but I bet that girl
is a killer in the sack.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.182
You okay?

13:40.184 --> 13:41.618
I'm fine.

13:54.598 --> 13:55.834
What happened, Maddy?

14:00.271 --> 14:01.137
Okay.

14:01.139 --> 14:02.971
We don't have to talk.

14:02.973 --> 14:06.578
We can just wait for my dad to shout
something offensive from my house.

14:08.713 --> 14:10.279
It's okay.

14:10.281 --> 14:11.980
It's a good distraction
from the fact that

14:11.982 --> 14:13.182
I've been completely betrayed

14:13.184 --> 14:15.818
by both my ex-bf and my ex-bff.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.486
In a way...

14:17.488 --> 14:21.057
it's not that surprising.

14:21.059 --> 14:23.259
Prom and graduation are
just around the corner,

14:23.261 --> 14:26.395
everyone is losing their minds
trying to create

14:26.397 --> 14:29.966
one last set of picture perfect
memories they can post,

14:29.968 --> 14:32.568
to prove how awesome

14:32.570 --> 14:34.105
their high school
experience was.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.273
You're right.

14:38.275 --> 14:41.244
You know, it's been a while
since we hung out like this.

14:41.246 --> 14:44.382
Does consoling you sobbing
constitute us hanging out?

14:49.588 --> 14:52.322
Do you remember when
we drew those chalk outlines

14:52.324 --> 14:55.995
of ourselves on the front sidewalk
and called the cops as a prank?

14:56.428 --> 14:58.027
Yeah.

14:58.029 --> 15:00.163
Do you remember that transmutation
circle I added nearby?

15:00.165 --> 15:01.099
Yeah, I do.

15:02.032 --> 15:03.600
Did you ever
watch <i>Brotherhood?</i>

15:03.602 --> 15:05.036
Oh, God. No.

15:08.405 --> 15:09.541
Was it good?

15:10.675 --> 15:12.044
Doesn't matter.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.887
I thought he loved me.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.356
You now what?
Screw him.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.293
They are drama absurdity.

15:30.328 --> 15:31.530
And I know you.

15:33.397 --> 15:34.596
I see you at school,

15:34.598 --> 15:38.069
and you are different from
all of the other popular kids.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.239
Then why don't you
ever talk to me?

15:42.741 --> 15:44.242
I could ask you
the same thing.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.019
Cole, come on,
we're taking a selfie.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.986
What? No.
No, no, no.

15:57.988 --> 15:59.557
Yeah. Come on,
let's go.

16:00.925 --> 16:02.328
Okay, but I've...

16:03.895 --> 16:05.965
never done that before.

16:06.363 --> 16:07.596
Wait...

16:07.598 --> 16:09.468
You're a selfie virgin?

16:10.702 --> 16:12.338
A surgeon?

16:12.703 --> 16:13.836
Yes.

16:13.838 --> 16:16.438
Oh, I am so taking
your selfie virginity.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.207
Smile. Look happy.

16:20.645 --> 16:22.378
Wait, why are you
taking so many?

16:22.380 --> 16:23.145
"So many"?

16:23.147 --> 16:24.346
I'm just getting started.

16:24.348 --> 16:26.182
I have to take at least 40
before I can post.

16:26.184 --> 16:26.950
What?

16:26.952 --> 16:28.083
You'll get used to it.

16:28.085 --> 16:29.852
What is your Insta,
so I can tag you.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.888
Oh, no.
No, no need for that.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.425
Give me your phone.
Come on, give me.

16:40.732 --> 16:42.168
Wow, did you do these?

16:43.234 --> 16:44.369
Uh, yeah.

16:45.203 --> 16:47.336
My drawing skills
are pathetic.

16:47.338 --> 16:49.340
I don't have any cool
talents whatsoever.

16:51.175 --> 16:52.277
Actually...

16:53.344 --> 16:55.979
I remember something that

16:55.981 --> 16:57.550
you were pretty amazing at.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.290
The crowd goes wild!

17:04.588 --> 17:05.957
Ah!

17:09.993 --> 17:11.128
All right. You done?

17:12.230 --> 17:13.999
You ready to crown me victor?

17:18.536 --> 17:20.068
Perfect.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.738
What happened to
40 pictures?

17:21.740 --> 17:23.473
Moments like this
should be unfiltered.

17:31.616 --> 17:33.016
Oh, p.s.,

17:33.018 --> 17:35.287
you are being followed by
the whole school on Instagram.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.589
What?

17:38.255 --> 17:39.055
Byproduct.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.155
Why did you do that?

17:40.157 --> 17:41.526
I don't want people
seeing my stuff.

17:43.094 --> 17:44.129
Um...

17:45.597 --> 17:47.630
I'm deleting my account.

17:47.632 --> 17:48.901
Very funny, Cole.

17:54.204 --> 17:57.009
Oh, we are so different now.

17:57.675 --> 17:59.410
Maybe you are.
I'm not.

18:01.378 --> 18:02.915
Why did we stop talking?

18:06.384 --> 18:07.553
Really?

18:08.686 --> 18:10.155
You don't remember?

18:11.388 --> 18:12.523
No.

18:15.559 --> 18:16.960
Tighty?

18:16.962 --> 18:18.560
I never called you that.

18:18.562 --> 18:19.862
Yeah, well,
when that happened

18:19.864 --> 18:21.600
that was the beginning
of the end for us.

18:24.001 --> 18:26.068
What's up, bro!

18:30.375 --> 18:31.774
How you doing, Tighty?

18:31.776 --> 18:32.978
What you got there?

18:54.165 --> 18:55.834
I don't really know
what to say.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.101
Doesn't matter.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.239
What gets me though is that
Kane and I used to be friends.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.876
Well, at least
we're friends again.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.309
We are?

19:07.311 --> 19:09.048
Yeah, we are.

19:12.649 --> 19:14.217
Damn it!

19:14.219 --> 19:17.122
Why did all of this have to
happen right before prom?

19:18.322 --> 19:19.489
That's it.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.789
What's it?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.090
Prom.

19:22.092 --> 19:23.526
As long as you
go to prom,

19:23.528 --> 19:26.528
your high school experience
won't be a complete bust.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.964
And if you're crowned prom
king or queen,

19:28.966 --> 19:31.267
it's like being told
you win at high school.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.368
Yeah, but sometimes
it's the gay kid,

19:33.370 --> 19:34.636
or the trans-sexual kid,

19:34.638 --> 19:36.005
or the crippled kid.

19:36.007 --> 19:39.409
So that the popular kids
can feel like good people for

19:39.411 --> 19:41.046
<i>allowing</i> it to happen.

19:41.913 --> 19:43.848
I never thought
of it that way.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.883
See, um...

19:46.885 --> 19:48.518
What the popular kids
don't realize

19:48.520 --> 19:51.386
is that most of their awesome
high school experiences

19:51.388 --> 19:53.155
are at the expense

19:53.157 --> 19:55.394
of the unpopular
kids' feelings.

20:05.036 --> 20:06.839
What if we ruined it?

20:08.740 --> 20:10.173
What?

20:10.175 --> 20:11.740
Prom.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.276
You mad, bro?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.743
No, I'm serious.

20:14.745 --> 20:16.244
I mean, don't they deserve it?

20:16.246 --> 20:18.114
I think you're just a little
upset about what happened today.

20:18.116 --> 20:21.150
No, this is my chance to
reject the last four years.

20:21.152 --> 20:22.317
How?

20:22.319 --> 20:24.319
We'll make it a night that
they'll never forget.

20:24.321 --> 20:27.623
We'll do it by
completely destroying it.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.692
I mean, it sounds fun, but...

20:29.694 --> 20:31.096
I already have plans
that night.

20:31.328 --> 20:32.364
Oh.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.366
Hot date, huh?

20:35.532 --> 20:36.767
What's her name?

20:37.799 --> 20:38.468
The art school that
I've applied to

20:38.470 --> 20:41.240
is holding a gallery night for
their prospective students.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.107
Okay.

20:44.475 --> 20:45.974
But come on, Cole.

20:45.976 --> 20:48.146
This is how you win
at high school.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.616
Do it with me.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.155
Fine. I'm in.

20:57.521 --> 20:58.857
Yes!

21:02.393 --> 21:04.894
We're doing this. I can't
believe we're doing this.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.863
You and me,
back together again.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.431
Reality check.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.401
We're gonna need
some help.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.000
No way.

21:12.002 --> 21:13.236
"No way"?
What do you mean "no way"?

21:13.238 --> 21:14.804
You hate them all
worse than I do.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.172
I'm just not
that riled.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.374
Besides, getting revenge
on the popular kids?

21:18.376 --> 21:20.343
That's like bullying
from our side.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.380
So, are you in?

21:22.614 --> 21:24.046
She's involved.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.250
Yeah, not happening.

21:25.649 --> 21:27.182
Hey, Cole.

21:27.184 --> 21:28.084
Hey.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.252
Holy shit, he talked to you.

21:30.254 --> 21:32.622
City, come on.
This is our last chance

21:32.624 --> 21:34.957
to create the memories we
wanna leave high school with.

21:34.959 --> 21:37.125
Hey, you're Cole, right?

21:37.127 --> 21:39.394
I'm so sorry. I was trying to
follow you on Instagram,

21:39.396 --> 21:42.330
but for some reason I cannot
find your account at all.

21:42.332 --> 21:43.201
What's the deal?

21:43.934 --> 21:45.136
I deleted it.

21:45.435 --> 21:46.338
What?

21:46.703 --> 21:47.973
Oh!

21:53.144 --> 21:54.076
Yeah.

21:54.078 --> 21:55.944
Definitely want
no part of this.

21:55.946 --> 21:57.882
City, we're trying
to make a statement.

21:59.416 --> 22:00.682
A statement?

22:00.684 --> 22:03.952
Since when have you spoken up
about anything, you basic bitch?

22:03.954 --> 22:05.491
City, find your chill.

22:05.723 --> 22:07.222
Why?

22:07.224 --> 22:09.192
Because suddenly life isn't
perfect for Little Miss Popular

22:09.194 --> 22:11.460
and now she wants
her revenge?

22:11.462 --> 22:12.761
Why should I
give a shit?

22:12.763 --> 22:14.063
City...

22:14.065 --> 22:16.531
Who! Excuse me, Tighty,
didn't see you there.

22:16.533 --> 22:18.166
Don't call him that.

22:18.168 --> 22:20.068
What is up with you, Maddy?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.871
Taking selfies
with this loser

22:21.873 --> 22:23.172
and not returning my texts?

22:23.174 --> 22:25.277
I almost got desperate
and used my phone...

22:26.444 --> 22:27.676
as a phone...

22:27.678 --> 22:29.247
to like actually call you.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.217
What are you
looking at, Stuffs?

22:34.652 --> 22:35.921
My name is...

22:39.389 --> 22:40.391
You know what?

22:41.158 --> 22:42.326
Forget everything I just said.

22:43.161 --> 22:44.229
I'm in.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.301
Principal Statszill here.

22:53.303 --> 22:55.871
Another inspiring day
comes to a close,

22:55.873 --> 22:58.274
here at Charles Adams High.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.509
Whoo!

22:59.511 --> 23:01.176
<i>I've been fielding complaints
from the juniors</i>

23:01.178 --> 23:04.115
<i>about the amount of time I spend
discussing the senior prom.</i>

23:04.448 --> 23:06.048
<i>I say...</i>

23:06.050 --> 23:07.916
<i>Get a senior to take you.</i>

23:07.918 --> 23:10.353
It's only statutory
if you get caught.

23:10.355 --> 23:13.256
Oh, and finals are
right around the corner.

23:13.258 --> 23:14.393
So, uh...

23:15.526 --> 23:17.062
Study, I guess.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.575
Stay away from me.

23:32.577 --> 23:35.644
I came to pee and you were
an unfortunate byproduct.

23:35.646 --> 23:36.881
So gladly.

23:37.447 --> 23:38.349
Marissa, wait.

23:42.453 --> 23:44.153
Yes?

23:44.155 --> 23:46.391
How long has it been going on
between you and Kane?

23:48.192 --> 23:49.357
Depends.

23:49.359 --> 23:51.829
Does sending him nudes
count as the beginning?

23:52.163 --> 23:53.429
Wow.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.866
Typical Marissa.

23:55.366 --> 23:56.665
Yes, yes, yes.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.901
Typical whore Marissa.

23:58.903 --> 23:59.902
Way to slut shame.

23:59.904 --> 24:01.304
He was my boyfriend.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.506
And you were supposed to be
my best friend.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.374
We may be the M&Ms,

24:05.376 --> 24:07.509
but everyone knows
it's all about Maddy.

24:07.511 --> 24:10.479
And her hairstyles, and her
Instagram, and her boyfriend.

24:10.481 --> 24:12.213
None of that is my fault.

24:12.215 --> 24:14.583
What about giving me
an eating disorder

24:14.585 --> 24:16.251
by yelling, "Delete it. Fat."

24:16.253 --> 24:18.119
any time I post
a bikini pic on Instagram?

24:18.121 --> 24:19.689
I was trying to be helpful.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.390
And never tagging me
in any pics of us,

24:21.392 --> 24:23.224
claiming you'll never
do that for anyone,

24:23.226 --> 24:24.894
just so you'll get
more followers.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.896
And then you go
and tag Tighty? WTF?

24:27.898 --> 24:29.531
Oh, enough with
the abbreviating.

24:29.533 --> 24:31.866
Tagging you on Instagram and
hooking up with my boyfriend

24:31.868 --> 24:33.368
are not even in
the same universe.

24:33.370 --> 24:35.171
The BF you wouldn't even
have if it weren't for me.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.075
Stop abbreviating!
You...

24:38.608 --> 24:40.108
Wait, what?

24:40.110 --> 24:42.144
The only reason Kane was in
the gym during cheer practice

24:42.146 --> 24:44.713
and saved you from that
basket toss gone awry,

24:44.715 --> 24:46.481
was because I texted him.

24:46.483 --> 24:49.652
Then with fate's cruel twist,
you landed in his arms.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.319
Your perfect meeting

24:51.321 --> 24:52.788
was an accident.

24:52.790 --> 24:56.161
Not some Disney princess
destiny bullshit.

24:57.561 --> 25:00.496
So why are you
doing this now?

25:00.498 --> 25:03.265
Easy. Prom.

25:03.267 --> 25:05.968
I know how much being
crowned queen means to you.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.371
Which only makes me
want it more.

25:08.373 --> 25:12.077
And being with Kane
equals prom queen, pidge.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.044
Now just reflect

25:15.046 --> 25:17.149
and listen to
my urine hit the water.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.222
I reflected.

25:27.224 --> 25:28.993
My whole life has
been a lie.

25:29.659 --> 25:31.329
Excuse me!

25:34.365 --> 25:36.001
Ready to do this, Dadner?

25:36.567 --> 25:38.002
Hell, yeah.

25:52.015 --> 25:53.449
How do you do this?

25:53.451 --> 25:54.953
Thirty-nine more.
Here we go.

26:34.192 --> 26:37.559
Yeah, we're gonna need
more people to pull this off.

26:37.561 --> 26:39.561
Who would wanna
help us?

26:39.563 --> 26:42.367
Every kid you and your
ex-friends ever made fun of.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.858
What's up, big guy?

27:09.860 --> 27:11.160
Not today, you guys.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.328
I got you a pulled
pork sandwich.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.363
No, that's...

27:14.365 --> 27:15.931
You're not gonna believe
what I got for you.

27:15.933 --> 27:17.700
A little hot dog.

27:17.702 --> 27:18.968
My mom packed
you a necklace.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.301
- Wait, no. Please...
- Sausage links.

27:20.303 --> 27:21.737
Oh, look at that.

27:21.739 --> 27:23.538
Fresh ham,
right out the deli.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.707
Hanks are
non-kosher, okay.

27:24.709 --> 27:25.807
How about this one?

27:25.809 --> 27:26.912
Oh!

27:28.678 --> 27:30.211
Could you pick that up
for me, please?

27:30.213 --> 27:31.413
I can't move without it
on my head.

27:31.415 --> 27:34.450
You guys are killing me
right now. Just...

27:34.452 --> 27:35.921
I have to get to class.

27:36.553 --> 27:37.886
Shut up, Strings.

27:37.888 --> 27:39.421
It's called a <i>tzitzit.</i>

27:39.423 --> 27:41.022
Yeah, whatever, Strings.

27:41.024 --> 27:43.491
Strings,
Strings, Strings,

27:43.493 --> 27:45.193
Strings,
Strings, Strings,

27:45.195 --> 27:47.496
Strings,
Strings, Strings...

28:10.021 --> 28:10.986
OMG.

28:10.988 --> 28:12.320
You're so sweaty.

28:12.322 --> 28:14.990
It's like your body is
literally crying for help.

28:14.992 --> 28:17.459
I can't believe you're
talking to me.

28:17.461 --> 28:19.862
Not kidding, but the sweat
stain on your back

28:19.864 --> 28:22.601
literally looks like the
United States of America.

28:24.501 --> 28:26.268
I'm posting this.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.671
<i>Sweat that makes up stains
in an abnormal way</i>

28:28.673 --> 28:30.538
<i>is seriously gross.</i>

28:34.278 --> 28:35.510
Ew.

28:35.512 --> 28:36.878
You look like a swamp.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.480
Did you jump in the pool?

28:38.482 --> 28:39.949
It's not my fault!

28:39.951 --> 28:41.453
I have a glandular issue.

28:58.769 --> 29:00.402
"Boo Radley was an outsider.

29:00.404 --> 29:02.837
A recluse who never left
his house, thanks to..."

29:04.008 --> 29:05.574
"The terrible rumors
spread about him..."

29:05.576 --> 29:06.808
...those titties.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.644
Those were supposed to
be for my boyfriend!

29:08.646 --> 29:10.382
Please stop spreading
them around.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.619
You shared it with them?

29:19.857 --> 29:21.225
Whatever.

29:22.059 --> 29:23.392
You shouldn't have
trusted me.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.961
<i>Tig, Tig, Tig, Tig!</i>

29:25.963 --> 29:28.730
Tig, Tig, Tig, Tig!

29:28.732 --> 29:30.899
Tig, Tig, Tig, Tig!

29:30.901 --> 29:33.035
Tig, Tig, Tig, Tig!

29:33.037 --> 29:35.871
Tig, Tig, Tig, Tig!

29:35.873 --> 29:38.140
High school is
the God damn worst.

29:57.627 --> 29:58.961
Who here
did the reading,

29:58.963 --> 30:01.899
and knows the difference
between DNA and RNA?

30:03.233 --> 30:04.333
Emile?

30:04.335 --> 30:05.971
The difference is...

30:07.003 --> 30:08.569
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

30:09.740 --> 30:11.343
The difference is...

30:12.376 --> 30:13.411
Anyone else?

30:14.211 --> 30:15.943
Yes, Achiva?

30:15.945 --> 30:17.078
<i>The difference is...</i>

30:17.080 --> 30:18.980
He sounds like
a sick parrot.

30:18.982 --> 30:20.715
Squawk, squawk, little bird.

30:20.717 --> 30:22.183
He's such a nerd!

30:40.404 --> 30:43.174
I'll never speak again.

31:40.697 --> 31:42.564
Whoo!

31:48.672 --> 31:51.576
Legals! Legals! Legals!

32:24.942 --> 32:27.709
Okay, here's the sich, people,

32:27.711 --> 32:29.510
we are going to destroy prom

32:29.512 --> 32:32.013
for all the a-holes who
destroyed high school for us.

32:32.015 --> 32:34.950
Seriously, who cares
about the stupid prom?

32:34.952 --> 32:36.652
Pretty much
everyone at school,

32:36.654 --> 32:37.986
except for us.

32:37.988 --> 32:39.688
How do we know that
this isn't some

32:39.690 --> 32:41.522
cruel game that
she is playing

32:41.524 --> 32:43.357
to humiliate us later, huh?

32:43.359 --> 32:44.593
I would never do that.

32:44.595 --> 32:45.827
So we're just supposed
to forget

32:45.829 --> 32:47.563
about all the pain your
people put us through

32:47.565 --> 32:48.864
and help you out?

32:48.866 --> 32:50.499
Yeah, no way.

32:50.501 --> 32:51.569
I'm out.

32:54.704 --> 32:56.104
Listen.

32:56.106 --> 32:58.906
Here's something I've
learned the hard way.

32:58.908 --> 33:01.175
Popularity is just some
ridiculous concept

33:01.177 --> 33:02.880
that ruins people's lives.

33:03.746 --> 33:05.847
Truth is,
you're the lucky ones.

33:05.849 --> 33:08.049
I'm envious of
all of you.

33:08.051 --> 33:09.553
An M&M is envious?

33:10.788 --> 33:12.421
- Of us?
- Yes.

33:12.423 --> 33:16.124
Despite being rejected, you all
have stayed true to yourselves.

33:16.126 --> 33:19.461
I've always done everything
in my power to fit in.

33:19.463 --> 33:22.663
And I'll admit my reasons
for doing this are pathetic.

33:22.665 --> 33:25.767
My popular boyfriend leaves
me for my popular best friend.

33:25.769 --> 33:27.070
Big deal, right?

33:28.739 --> 33:31.209
But it's not too late to
correct the errors of my ways.

33:32.943 --> 33:34.578
I don't deserve your trust.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.250
But I do wanna
change things.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.255
Together we can
make a statement.

33:46.322 --> 33:47.324
So what do you say?

34:05.909 --> 34:08.245
I have no idea how we
all understood that, but...

34:09.647 --> 34:11.282
Okay, we're in.

34:12.447 --> 34:13.583
Yes!

34:15.252 --> 34:16.449
Okay, you guys.

34:16.452 --> 34:19.187
Maddy is like the Khaleesi
and Cole us King of the North.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.987
Then what does that
make me?

34:20.989 --> 34:23.391
Brienne, the bad ass
lady knight?

34:23.393 --> 34:24.659
Eh, I'll take it.

34:25.629 --> 34:27.360
- What's up, losers?
- Whoa.

34:27.362 --> 34:28.830
A popular person.

34:28.831 --> 34:31.264
It's okay, guys.
He's one of us.

34:31.266 --> 34:33.503
Your text was cryptic,
City, but...

34:34.536 --> 34:36.138
Now I see.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.038
See what?

34:37.040 --> 34:39.005
Just trying to find
a place to fit in.

34:39.007 --> 34:40.775
Apparently I'm too gay
for the straights,

34:40.777 --> 34:42.347
and too straight
for the gays. But...

34:43.446 --> 34:45.045
maybe with you, Cole.

34:45.047 --> 34:47.415
Somewhere I fit in.

34:47.417 --> 34:50.150
If you help us out, Cole will
blow you, no questions asked.

34:50.152 --> 34:51.085
I what?

34:51.088 --> 34:52.520
Unlike on
the basketball court,

34:52.522 --> 34:53.788
I shall pass.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.391
Sorry, buddy,
no offense, but...

34:56.525 --> 34:57.558
you're just too fat
for me.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.026
But I'm still in.

34:59.028 --> 35:00.162
What's the plan?

35:00.164 --> 35:02.763
We meet away from school,
my place tomorrow.

35:02.765 --> 35:04.167
And I...

35:05.970 --> 35:08.602
Sorry, I just wanted
the last word.

35:08.604 --> 35:11.105
<i> Maddy
Dadner, report to the principal's office.</i>

35:11.107 --> 35:13.343
<i>Maddy Dadner,
principal's office.</i>

35:27.423 --> 35:29.326
Oh! Madeline Dadner.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.325
Oh, Maddy!

35:31.327 --> 35:33.662
Maddy, Maddy! Oh!

35:33.664 --> 35:35.897
Maddy, the model student!

35:35.899 --> 35:37.568
Maddy Miss Popular.

35:38.535 --> 35:43.908
Maddy. Maddy, who reminds
me so much of myself.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.707
Why am I here?

35:45.709 --> 35:47.078
Because of this.

35:49.847 --> 35:51.113
I'm not sure I follow.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.383
That is a picture of
you and Cole Reed.

35:54.283 --> 35:55.517
So?

35:55.519 --> 35:57.618
Cole Reed is...

35:57.620 --> 35:58.488
weird.

35:59.589 --> 36:01.589
Okay? He's always drawing.

36:01.591 --> 36:04.993
Looking like he belongs in a
hipster version of <i>iCarly.</i>

36:04.995 --> 36:07.462
I mean, he doesn't
even belong to a clique.

36:07.464 --> 36:10.598
Are you trying to tell me who I
can and can't be friends with?

36:10.600 --> 36:11.933
Oh, Maddy.

36:11.935 --> 36:14.803
I just don't want you
squandering your reputation

36:14.805 --> 36:15.937
here at the finish line.

36:15.939 --> 36:17.141
What do you mean?

36:18.642 --> 36:20.979
High school sets
the tone for life.

36:21.477 --> 36:22.276
All right?

36:22.278 --> 36:24.546
Look at me.
Honor Society, yearbook,

36:24.548 --> 36:28.082
and the only freshman ever
to be elected class president.

36:28.084 --> 36:30.819
And captain of
the cheer squad. Whoo!

36:32.756 --> 36:35.057
And where did
that lead me? Hmm?

36:35.059 --> 36:38.192
To becoming the youngest
high school principal

36:38.194 --> 36:39.560
in the history of the state,

36:39.562 --> 36:40.995
right back where
it all began,

36:40.997 --> 36:42.833
here at Charles Adams High.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.200
Whoo!

36:45.202 --> 36:48.270
I don't get how this has
anything to do with me.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.607
The point is...

36:51.542 --> 36:54.575
I didn't throw it all away
in the last minute

36:54.577 --> 36:56.046
by hanging out with...

36:56.647 --> 36:57.949
Well...

36:59.283 --> 37:00.182
<i>Those</i> people.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.084
And what do you mean
by "those people"?

37:02.086 --> 37:03.752
Oh, you know
what I mean.

37:03.754 --> 37:04.953
Not really.

37:04.955 --> 37:06.921
Oh, come on, girl.

37:06.923 --> 37:08.559
You're a smart cookie.

37:09.392 --> 37:10.658
Yeah, and I don't get it.

37:10.660 --> 37:11.993
The losers!

37:11.995 --> 37:14.361
Don't hang out with
the losers.

37:15.932 --> 37:17.131
Just looking out
for you, hon.

37:17.133 --> 37:18.866
By calling
my friends losers

37:18.868 --> 37:21.069
and printing out
my Instagram feed?

37:21.071 --> 37:22.671
I don't even know
how to do that.

37:22.673 --> 37:23.971
Oh, there's an app
for that.

37:23.973 --> 37:26.241
Why are you even
on my Instagram?

37:26.243 --> 37:27.245
Oh, honey...

37:28.111 --> 37:30.212
If you think
the entire faculty

37:30.214 --> 37:32.580
isn't following
their students online...

37:32.582 --> 37:34.117
then you're cray cray.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.185
Wow.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.352
Think about
what I said, okay?

37:38.354 --> 37:39.523
Selfie time? Hmm?

37:40.624 --> 37:41.790
Maddy?

37:41.792 --> 37:42.823
Maddy!

37:42.825 --> 37:44.292
Oh, this lighting
is great. Maddy!

37:44.294 --> 37:46.528
Maddy, Maddy, Maddy.
Turn around.

37:46.530 --> 37:47.895
Turn around.

37:47.897 --> 37:49.464
Oh, Maddy!

37:53.769 --> 37:55.172
So when can I read it?

37:57.073 --> 37:58.707
When it's good enough.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.044
Which may be never.

38:02.479 --> 38:05.046
You're so talented.

38:05.048 --> 38:07.285
Any art school would be
crazy not to take you.

38:09.553 --> 38:10.922
So, yeah.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.090
You're in my room.

38:13.689 --> 38:15.059
So I am.

38:15.758 --> 38:17.392
Oh, it's no big deal.

38:17.394 --> 38:18.826
Not a big deal
at all.

38:18.828 --> 38:20.932
No. I don't really think
it's a big deal.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.336
So, what did Statszill say?

38:27.303 --> 38:28.837
Oh, just enough
for me to know

38:28.839 --> 38:30.671
that I'm 100%
doing the right thing

38:30.673 --> 38:32.008
in ruining the prom.

38:34.044 --> 38:35.413
You are doing
the right thing.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.216
Oh, well...
We are.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.419
Together.

38:46.890 --> 38:48.924
Listen, Cole...

38:48.926 --> 38:50.792
I'm sorry about everything
that's happened

38:50.794 --> 38:52.294
since the first day
of high school.

38:52.296 --> 38:53.928
We've been over this before.
It's fine.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.066
- No.
- Really.

38:55.798 --> 38:57.167
No, it's really not.

39:01.004 --> 39:03.174
We used to hang out
in here all the time.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.776
And I used to sit
right here,

39:08.778 --> 39:10.044
just like this.

39:10.046 --> 39:11.645
Jesus! How many hours
do you think we spent

39:11.647 --> 39:12.950
playing Pokemon in here?

39:13.450 --> 39:15.716
Like a million.

39:15.718 --> 39:18.886
And we talked about how crazy
it would be when we turned 16

39:18.888 --> 39:20.191
and were able to drive.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.429
Prom wasn't even on
our radar back then.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.904
Cole...

39:33.403 --> 39:34.437
I have to honest.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.404
Yeah.

39:37.406 --> 39:39.876
I used to think about prom
even back then.

39:42.044 --> 39:44.481
Wait, are you having second
thoughts about our plan?

39:46.682 --> 39:49.683
I guess I'm just saying...

39:49.685 --> 39:51.218
as much as I wanna
go through with it,

39:51.220 --> 39:53.925
I think part of me just
wishes I could go to prom.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.526
Does that make me
a hypocrite?

39:58.394 --> 39:59.361
Not really.

39:59.363 --> 40:01.899
I think to some degree
we all kinda want to go.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.135
Society, right?

40:06.370 --> 40:07.167
Good.

40:07.169 --> 40:08.539
At least I'm not alone.

40:09.805 --> 40:11.876
What do you say we kick it
old school style?

40:13.075 --> 40:14.875
How so?

40:14.877 --> 40:17.812
Like eat microwave popcorn,

40:17.814 --> 40:19.149
watch some TV?

40:20.082 --> 40:22.185
You said <i>Brotherhood</i>
was good, right?

40:23.486 --> 40:25.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:25.622 --> 40:29.957
So the beginning is almost exactly
the same as the original <i>Fullmetal.</i>

40:29.959 --> 40:30.959
- Okay.
- But, uh...

40:30.961 --> 40:33.560
then it takes
this huge turn...

40:33.562 --> 40:34.828
Ooh.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.397
Suspenseful.

40:36.399 --> 40:37.867
You remember it, right?

40:38.669 --> 40:40.401
Refresh my memory.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.203
Gotcha.
Okay, here we go.

40:42.205 --> 40:45.443
Edward and Alphonse Elric,
brothers.

40:46.575 --> 40:47.808
Alchemists.

40:47.810 --> 40:49.410
They got transmutation
circle thing.

40:49.412 --> 40:50.812
They're trying to
bring their mom back.

40:50.814 --> 40:51.879
It all goes wrong.

40:51.881 --> 40:53.515
Alphonse loses
his body.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.283
Edward loses his leg...

41:37.560 --> 41:38.692
Hey, baby.

41:38.694 --> 41:40.060
- Not now.
- WTF.

41:40.062 --> 41:41.830
Come on, Kane, let's
give everyone a show.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.434
Jesus! Would you stop it!

41:44.100 --> 41:45.033
What's your damage?

41:45.035 --> 41:46.433
This was a mistake.

41:46.435 --> 41:47.736
We're done.

41:47.738 --> 41:48.939
What?

41:50.573 --> 41:53.073
Did you see who Maddy
was going to prom with?

41:53.075 --> 41:54.642
Oh, my God.
He's totes hot.

41:54.644 --> 41:57.379
I'm totally voting for them
as prom king and queen.

41:57.381 --> 41:58.513
Me, too.

41:58.515 --> 42:01.218
I dind't see it until now,
but I totally shifted.

42:16.932 --> 42:18.466
No lunch today?

42:18.468 --> 42:20.435
Nothing here's kosher.

42:20.437 --> 42:23.071
Wait, you're Jewish, too?

42:23.073 --> 42:24.605
You don't
look like it.

42:24.607 --> 42:26.040
On my mom's side.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.912
My dad's
a struggling Buddhist.

42:28.979 --> 42:30.611
Mm. Interesting.

42:30.613 --> 42:32.279
But, <i>shomer negiah...</i>

42:32.281 --> 42:33.984
What's all
the hollering about?

42:34.316 --> 42:35.318
Um...

42:36.385 --> 42:37.819
I can't touch a girl

42:37.821 --> 42:40.087
even the slightest bit, so...

42:40.089 --> 42:41.492
Unless you're my wife...

42:41.925 --> 42:43.060
we can't.

42:45.194 --> 42:46.196
Oh, no.

42:47.763 --> 42:49.363
I didn't mean...

42:49.365 --> 42:50.967
Well... Never mind.

42:53.870 --> 42:56.236
Oh, how exciting.

42:56.238 --> 42:59.040
Prom king and queen,
right beside us.

42:59.042 --> 43:02.410
Shouldn't we be excited that we're
all technically going to prom now?

43:03.613 --> 43:04.946
Wait. Guys, hold on.

43:04.948 --> 43:06.214
I wanna document
this moment.

43:06.216 --> 43:08.850
I'm gonna take a selfie
and tag all of you in it.

43:08.852 --> 43:10.020
Cool!

43:14.457 --> 43:15.656
- Sweet.
- Got it.

43:15.658 --> 43:17.158
Hold on. Hold on.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.430
We have to take at least 40 or 50
to make sure we all look good.

43:38.481 --> 43:39.948
Hey, Tighty.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.816
Calling me that is not gonna help
you get whatever you want from me.

43:41.818 --> 43:43.517
But I got your attention.

43:43.519 --> 43:45.386
You didn't get my attention as much
as you shoved me a locked closet.

43:45.388 --> 43:47.187
Yeah, but you
didn't fight back.

43:47.189 --> 43:49.524
Marissa,
what do you want?

43:49.526 --> 43:51.658
You, me, prom.

43:51.660 --> 43:53.727
I'm already going
with Maddy.

43:53.729 --> 43:55.462
Ditch tat pidge
and come with me.

43:55.464 --> 43:56.763
Are you high?

43:56.765 --> 43:58.633
A little. But that doesn't
mean I don't mean what I say.

43:58.635 --> 43:59.933
Why do you wanna
go with me?

43:59.935 --> 44:01.769
Your profile is
on the up,

44:01.771 --> 44:03.738
and Kane's is on the down.

44:03.740 --> 44:06.406
If I go with you,
prom queen could be mine.

44:06.408 --> 44:08.542
What makes you think
I would ever go with you

44:08.544 --> 44:10.377
after what
you did to Maddy?

44:10.379 --> 44:12.913
You're an idiot if you think she's
actually going to end up going with you.

44:12.915 --> 44:15.549
Kane wants her back
and Kane gets what he wants.

44:15.551 --> 44:17.986
She'll abandon you and your
loser friends in a heartbeat.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.153
You don't know her
like I do.

44:19.155 --> 44:21.022
I think it's
the other way around.

44:21.024 --> 44:24.392
Besides, she just wants
to go as friends.

44:24.394 --> 44:25.792
On the other hand,

44:25.794 --> 44:27.629
if you go with me,

44:27.631 --> 44:31.167
I'll make it very
worth your while.

44:32.435 --> 44:35.303
Let me take off
those tighty whiteys.

44:35.305 --> 44:36.236
Mm.

44:36.238 --> 44:37.471
Yeah, no.

44:37.473 --> 44:38.305
Wait, which one?

44:38.307 --> 44:39.908
You said yes, and then
you said no.

44:39.910 --> 44:41.241
It's gonna be a pass.

44:41.243 --> 44:43.578
"Pass"?
You can't just pass.

44:43.580 --> 44:45.245
Or shoot the ball,
whatever.

44:45.247 --> 44:47.549
You're not really good with
sports metaphors, are you?

44:47.551 --> 44:48.886
Not really.

44:59.595 --> 45:01.164
Hey, City, wait up.

45:01.765 --> 45:03.698
What is it, Dadner?

45:03.700 --> 45:05.569
Well, I thought we could
have some girl time.

45:06.535 --> 45:07.935
You're shitting me.

45:07.937 --> 45:10.171
What, you don't
do girl time?

45:10.173 --> 45:12.109
Somewhere in there
I know you do.

45:13.443 --> 45:15.078
Oh, great.

45:15.711 --> 45:16.877
Hey, Maddy.

45:16.879 --> 45:17.912
What's up, Stuffs?

45:17.914 --> 45:18.946
My name is Stufts.

45:18.948 --> 45:22.250
It's Stufts, not Stuffs.

45:22.252 --> 45:24.188
And I've nothing more
to say to you.

45:26.189 --> 45:28.689
You really don't wanna
go to prom with me?

45:28.691 --> 45:30.159
Not even slightly.

45:32.629 --> 45:33.897
Why don't you wanna
go with me?

45:34.531 --> 45:35.863
Are you dense?

45:35.865 --> 45:38.066
Because you cheated on me
with my best friend.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.301
It was a mistake, baby.

45:40.303 --> 45:42.106
And now that
you're with Tighty...

45:42.772 --> 45:44.538
I mean Cole.

45:44.540 --> 45:46.406
I realize that I can't stand to throw
away our relationship like this.

45:46.408 --> 45:48.075
Maybe you should have
thought of that

45:48.077 --> 45:50.477
before you had your tongue
hanging out of Marissa's nose.

45:50.479 --> 45:51.581
She sent you that pic?

45:53.850 --> 45:55.783
Never mind. Uh, look.

45:55.785 --> 45:57.352
I fucked up.

45:57.354 --> 45:59.287
All right? And I don't expect
things to go back to normal.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.589
But we have talked
about prom for years.

46:01.591 --> 46:03.491
We have to go together.

46:03.493 --> 46:05.261
Just because you apologize

46:06.363 --> 46:08.065
doesn't mean you get
what you want.

46:09.231 --> 46:10.567
Madeline.

46:13.870 --> 46:15.239
I'm sorry.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.442
All right? Truly.

46:19.475 --> 46:21.042
But please don't let
a single mistake

46:21.044 --> 46:22.946
rob us of our final
memories together.

46:25.381 --> 46:26.714
At the very least

46:26.716 --> 46:28.482
don't embarrass yourself
by making new ones

46:28.484 --> 46:29.452
with the losers at school.

46:32.888 --> 46:35.089
Nice speech.

46:35.091 --> 46:37.725
You know,
to some of us,

46:37.727 --> 46:39.229
you're the loser.

46:43.298 --> 46:45.600
You know, maybe if I'd kept
dating Stufts all these years,

46:45.602 --> 46:47.200
she'd be less of
an emo asshole.

46:47.202 --> 46:48.304
I'm not emo.

46:50.106 --> 46:52.910
Come on, let's go hang
out with Cole and the others.

46:53.209 --> 46:54.310
Wait.

46:54.977 --> 46:57.011
You and Kane?

46:57.013 --> 46:58.412
Oh, come on, you knew.

46:58.414 --> 46:59.881
No, I didn't.

46:59.883 --> 47:01.683
You're the one
he left for me.

47:01.685 --> 47:03.685
Yes, technically, but...

47:03.687 --> 47:05.218
seeing as I don't
really care,

47:05.220 --> 47:07.587
at all, just drop it,
okay?

47:07.589 --> 47:09.122
So when
Marissa said she got

47:09.124 --> 47:11.459
some girl out of the way,
that was you?

47:11.461 --> 47:13.660
- You're that girl?
- Yes, how do you...

47:13.662 --> 47:14.995
not know this?

47:14.997 --> 47:16.798
I mean, you're best friends
with all of the people

47:16.800 --> 47:18.633
who hate me
and call me Stuffs.

47:18.635 --> 47:20.968
I never took
part in it.

47:20.970 --> 47:22.837
I don't even know why
they call you that. Tell me.

47:22.839 --> 47:24.008
Fine.

47:33.249 --> 47:34.848
All of the boys have been
talking about

47:34.850 --> 47:36.750
which one of us
has the biggest chest.

47:36.752 --> 47:38.352
That is so judgmental.

47:38.354 --> 47:40.921
Like we can
control our bodies.

47:40.923 --> 47:43.991
I've been stuffing
for, like, two weeks.

47:43.993 --> 47:45.692
I'm getting
so much attention.

47:45.694 --> 47:46.761
Stuffing?

47:46.763 --> 47:48.229
Toilet paper
in my bra.

47:48.231 --> 47:49.930
It totally sells.

47:49.932 --> 47:51.401
Kane even talked
to me today.

47:52.267 --> 47:53.334
OMG.

47:53.336 --> 47:55.169
Wait, but isn't he
dating someone?

47:55.171 --> 47:57.174
Yeah, but she's
a total Aunt Jemima.

47:57.973 --> 47:59.107
You mean she's black?

47:59.109 --> 48:01.345
No. She's just
flat as a pancake.

48:02.312 --> 48:04.580
He'll lose interest
soon enough.

48:13.289 --> 48:14.522
Hey, Kane.

48:14.524 --> 48:16.691
Hey, there's my girl.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.428
I'm gonna go
get more fries.

48:21.531 --> 48:23.598
Oh, I'm so sorry!

48:23.600 --> 48:24.968
Oh!

48:25.568 --> 48:27.401
Wow.

48:27.403 --> 48:29.069
Wait, wait, you...

48:29.071 --> 48:30.473
What are you doing?

48:37.412 --> 48:38.381
Hey, wait.

48:39.381 --> 48:40.383
No.

48:41.651 --> 48:43.817
And Stuffs was born.

48:43.819 --> 48:46.155
All because I wanted
Kane to like me.

48:47.856 --> 48:49.392
And then he ended up
with me.

48:50.359 --> 48:51.959
You know, it's funny.

48:51.961 --> 48:54.932
I might have become you
had that not happened.

48:57.533 --> 48:59.001
Maybe it's better
you didn't.

48:59.502 --> 49:00.767
"Maybe"?

49:00.769 --> 49:02.105
I'd say definitely.

49:04.006 --> 49:05.975
Come on, Dadner.
Let's go.

49:11.147 --> 49:15.116
All right, so TJ and
Emile, you get above this stage,

49:15.118 --> 49:17.785
and that is our grand finale.

49:17.787 --> 49:19.587
Just one small issue.

49:19.589 --> 49:20.854
It's Shabbos tomorrow,

49:20.856 --> 49:22.892
so I can't do anything
involving electricity.

49:23.926 --> 49:25.826
Or using the phone.

49:25.828 --> 49:27.028
Or money.

49:27.030 --> 49:28.428
Until after sundown.

49:28.430 --> 49:29.763
Don't worry,
I'll come to your house

49:29.765 --> 49:31.534
and take care of
the dirty work for you.

49:34.102 --> 49:35.271
Okay.

49:36.205 --> 49:37.238
Sounds great.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.640
Perfect. It looks like
we're good to go.

49:39.642 --> 49:40.908
- Yes.
- Cool.

49:51.787 --> 49:53.553
What was that?

49:53.555 --> 49:55.525
- Nothing.
- Okay, now I have to see.

49:57.526 --> 49:58.758
Yep, he's right.
Nothing.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.530
Well, now I have to see.

50:02.631 --> 50:03.698
Oh.

50:03.700 --> 50:05.399
Well, now we have to see.

50:05.401 --> 50:06.403
What is it?

50:07.703 --> 50:08.736
Marissa pics.

50:08.738 --> 50:10.240
Oh, let me see that.

50:11.607 --> 50:14.709
It's for the scandal,
not the girl parts. Gross.

50:14.711 --> 50:16.076
Just chill, guys, okay?

50:16.078 --> 50:18.080
She's just trying to get me
to go to prom with her.

50:20.649 --> 50:21.852
This is perfect.

50:22.318 --> 50:23.220
Beyond.

50:25.488 --> 50:27.223
All right, um,
fill me in.

50:28.091 --> 50:29.293
You have to take her.

50:30.325 --> 50:31.491
Wait, what?

50:31.493 --> 50:34.127
Oh, I get it. Hmm.

50:34.129 --> 50:36.332
All right. Somebody just
clue me in here.

50:37.399 --> 50:38.732
If she goes with you,

50:38.734 --> 50:40.901
then we can set her up and ensure
everything we have planned

50:40.903 --> 50:42.338
she gets the worst of.

50:44.774 --> 50:45.740
What's this?

50:45.742 --> 50:46.841
Yes.

50:46.843 --> 50:48.542
My son having a party?

50:48.544 --> 50:53.046
Why in God's name would anyone
wanna come to a party he throws?

50:53.048 --> 50:55.117
Oh, 'cause they're
all freaks.

50:57.053 --> 50:59.122
But Maddy is here.

51:01.457 --> 51:02.790
We were just finishing up.

51:02.792 --> 51:05.062
Oh, I'm so sorry
you guys are leaving.

51:06.361 --> 51:08.595
You know, Maddy,
if you wanna hang out,

51:08.597 --> 51:10.031
I'll totally
get you guys beers.

51:10.033 --> 51:11.732
But you can't tell
your parents, okay?

51:11.734 --> 51:13.237
Okay, huh?

51:13.535 --> 51:15.269
Huh?

51:15.271 --> 51:16.372
Goodbye, Dad.

51:17.272 --> 51:18.441
Okay.

51:21.477 --> 51:23.080
Dude, when your balls drop...

51:27.550 --> 51:29.716
All right. Well,
on that note...

51:29.718 --> 51:31.252
let's call it a night.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.589
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:33.823 --> 51:35.288
We'll see you guys later.

51:35.290 --> 51:36.260
Bye.

51:42.631 --> 51:44.033
Hey.

51:45.767 --> 51:47.905
Ah... I thought
you took off.

51:48.771 --> 51:50.104
Well, I tried,

51:50.106 --> 51:52.843
but your dad insisted on showing
me his school yearbooks.

51:53.843 --> 51:55.178
All four years.

51:56.845 --> 51:58.912
Ah, I'm so sorry.

51:58.914 --> 52:00.883
Nobody should have to
endure that alone.

52:02.551 --> 52:04.988
Hey, you're really incredible
in leading us all.

52:06.656 --> 52:08.592
More like you.
It was all your idea.

52:09.258 --> 52:10.591
I'm no leader.

52:10.593 --> 52:11.861
Well, I think you are.

52:14.263 --> 52:16.500
So, are you sure you want me
to take Marissa to the prom?

52:20.068 --> 52:21.938
I know it sounds mean,

52:22.571 --> 52:24.437
but, yeah.

52:24.439 --> 52:25.406
I mean, she deserves it,

52:25.408 --> 52:27.375
and now that Kane's
not gonna take her,

52:27.377 --> 52:29.209
we need to ensure that
she shows up.

52:29.211 --> 52:30.347
Yeah.

52:30.979 --> 52:33.714
I was just kind of...

52:33.716 --> 52:35.452
really looking forward
to going with you.

52:37.586 --> 52:38.919
Oh.

52:38.921 --> 52:40.888
I mean, I know it would
just be as friends and all,

52:40.890 --> 52:44.024
and possible crushes
and whatever, but...

52:44.026 --> 52:45.792
even just getting to hang out
with you for the night,

52:45.794 --> 52:47.296
that's just...

52:52.568 --> 52:54.000
I'm... I'm sorry.

52:54.002 --> 52:55.636
- It's okay. Really.
- I don't know what I'm doing.

52:55.638 --> 52:56.770
It's fine.

52:56.772 --> 52:58.038
I gotta go.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.343
I'll call you tomorrow.

53:00.743 --> 53:02.145
Yeah, tomorrow.

53:23.066 --> 53:24.732
Are you all right, chicklet?

53:24.734 --> 53:27.535
I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine.

53:27.537 --> 53:30.004
Honey, I know you don't
always love our advice,

53:30.006 --> 53:32.272
but you can try and
talk to us.

53:32.274 --> 53:34.077
And we can try not
to screw it up.

53:36.044 --> 53:38.779
I feel like I'm on a treadmill
going way too fast

53:38.781 --> 53:40.147
for me to possibly step off,

53:40.149 --> 53:42.783
so I just keep going
faster and faster.

53:42.785 --> 53:44.451
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

53:44.453 --> 53:45.685
I thought you hated the gym.

53:45.687 --> 53:46.754
No, Mom.

53:46.756 --> 53:48.221
I'm talking about prom.

53:48.223 --> 53:49.323
- Oh.
- Ah.

53:49.325 --> 53:50.524
Wow, prom.

53:50.526 --> 53:53.093
Metaphors are not
our cup of soup.

53:53.095 --> 53:56.464
I don't get why I care
about it so much.

53:56.466 --> 53:59.667
Because, missy, ever since
you were a little girl,

53:59.669 --> 54:01.468
all you talked about
was prom.

54:01.470 --> 54:04.638
You would try on my dresses and
dance around in your room

54:04.640 --> 54:06.540
with your little
Teddy Ruxpin doll.

54:06.542 --> 54:07.540
So cute.

54:07.542 --> 54:08.875
You were adorable

54:08.877 --> 54:11.377
You even crowned your other
stuffed animals king and queen.

54:11.379 --> 54:15.281
I hate to admit it,
but I want to be prom queen.

54:15.283 --> 54:17.350
Even though it sounds
stupid and shallow.

54:17.352 --> 54:18.886
It doesn't sound stupid
at all, honey.

54:18.888 --> 54:20.053
- No.
- It's a little shallow,

54:20.055 --> 54:21.455
but it's not stupid.

54:21.457 --> 54:23.189
Most girls feel that way.

54:23.191 --> 54:24.758
Did you wanna be
prom queen?

54:24.760 --> 54:26.160
Of course I wanted
to be prom queen.

54:26.162 --> 54:28.261
But I'm sorry. Nobody
was gonna put a crown

54:28.263 --> 54:31.598
on Murphy Dadner's and
Christine Likinfelt's head.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.665
Oh, come on.

54:32.667 --> 54:33.801
I know it's hard to believe,

54:33.803 --> 54:35.669
because we're so cool now.

54:35.671 --> 54:37.470
You know, it's kind of
bizarre to have a daughter

54:37.472 --> 54:40.006
who's like the most
popular girl in school,

54:40.008 --> 54:42.111
when we were thought of
as being so weird.

54:43.211 --> 54:44.880
People still call us weird.

54:45.381 --> 54:46.546
To our face.

54:46.548 --> 54:47.983
You guys are weird!

54:48.718 --> 54:49.716
See?

54:49.718 --> 54:51.253
Well, what was
your prom like?

54:53.856 --> 54:55.388
Attention, everyone.

54:55.390 --> 54:59.392
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

54:59.394 --> 55:01.597
This is the crowning
of this year's

55:02.430 --> 55:03.897
prom king and queen.

55:03.899 --> 55:06.299
Murphy Dadner and
Christine Likinfelt.

55:08.571 --> 55:09.904
Not!

55:15.810 --> 55:17.944
I'm so sorry
that happened to you guys.

55:17.946 --> 55:20.281
Ah, no pain no gain.

55:20.283 --> 55:22.482
Listen, honey.
You're a good girl.

55:22.484 --> 55:25.752
If going to prom and
being crowned prom queen

55:25.754 --> 55:26.886
is gonna make you happy,

55:26.888 --> 55:28.055
then we say go for it.

55:28.057 --> 55:29.957
- Go for it.
- And don't you dare

55:29.959 --> 55:31.691
worry about what
anybody says,

55:31.693 --> 55:33.194
or what anybody thinks.

55:33.196 --> 55:34.297
You be you.

55:35.865 --> 55:37.031
Okay.

55:37.033 --> 55:39.767
- I love you.
- Aw, I love you, too.

55:39.769 --> 55:40.901
Thank you.

55:40.903 --> 55:42.405
You're welcome, chicken.

55:43.972 --> 55:45.341
'Night, peanut.

55:47.475 --> 55:49.442
I think this is the one time
we gave good advice.

55:49.444 --> 55:51.779
Let's enjoy it, because it's
not about to happen again.

55:51.781 --> 55:53.413
No, never.

55:53.415 --> 55:54.647
You're killing me.

55:54.649 --> 55:55.950
You're killing me!

55:55.952 --> 55:57.718
You're taking bread out of
my children's mouth.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.785
Get here. Look...

55:58.787 --> 55:59.986
I don't care what...
Look at the...

55:59.988 --> 56:01.357
Hey, Uncle Moish.

56:02.591 --> 56:04.457
I'll call you back.

56:04.459 --> 56:07.396
How much money would it take for you to
cancel all the limos for the prom tonight?

56:08.464 --> 56:10.129
I'd never do that.

56:10.131 --> 56:11.899
But what if I told you
it was for your nephew Efraim,

56:11.901 --> 56:14.435
and he was willing to spend the rest
of his bar mitzvah money on it?

56:14.437 --> 56:17.337
Listen, girl-who-uses-piercings-
to-get-attention,

56:17.339 --> 56:20.309
How do I know you're really
here for my nephew Ephraim?

57:46.861 --> 57:48.497
<i>Hey, lover.
When's the limo coming?</i>

57:49.265 --> 57:50.730
Limo canceled.
We're cabbing it.

57:50.732 --> 57:53.102
<i>I can't be seen
coming from a...</i>

57:53.669 --> 57:55.069
<i>I mean, okay.</i>

57:55.071 --> 57:57.004
<i>Doesn't matter,
as long as we're together.</i>

57:57.006 --> 57:58.872
<i>Prom's gonna be lit.</i>

57:58.874 --> 58:01.475
<i>Maybe you could do that thing on Instagram
where you're looking at me with heart eyes.</i>

58:01.477 --> 58:02.975
Yeah, whatever.

58:02.977 --> 58:04.544
<i>No need to get riled.</i>

58:04.546 --> 58:06.312
<i>I know you're upset Maddy
and Kane got back together,</i>

58:06.314 --> 58:07.881
<i>but don't take it out
on me.</i>

58:07.883 --> 58:09.386
I'm not upset about anything.

58:12.455 --> 58:13.886
What did you say?

58:13.888 --> 58:15.589
<i>I know.
Competish for sure.</i>

58:15.591 --> 58:18.392
<i>But I think everyone feels
really bad for you,</i>

58:18.394 --> 58:20.363
<i>so we still have a shot
at winning king and queen.</i>

58:23.531 --> 58:25.367
<i>Hello! Earth to Cole.</i>

58:27.903 --> 58:32.008
<i>Either way, you're so
gonna get laid tonight.</i>

58:40.883 --> 58:42.383
What the fuck!

58:42.385 --> 58:43.386
Maddy!

58:45.354 --> 58:46.919
Leave her alone, man.

58:46.921 --> 58:48.490
Kane, don't.
Just wait, please.

58:49.859 --> 58:50.823
What are you doing?

58:50.825 --> 58:51.991
Cole, calm down.

58:51.993 --> 58:53.627
How could you do this to me?
To all of us?

58:53.629 --> 58:54.928
- It's complicated.
- Try me!

58:54.930 --> 58:56.596
It's all happening too fast.

58:56.598 --> 58:58.064
Did last night
mean nothing to you?

58:58.066 --> 59:00.267
No. I just decided I'm not
gonna let petty revenge

59:00.269 --> 59:02.468
get in the way of me having the
prom that I've always wanted.

59:02.470 --> 59:05.805
Yeah, but with the guy
that ruined high school for me.

59:05.807 --> 59:06.973
That guy!

59:06.975 --> 59:09.075
I don't expect
you to understand.

59:09.077 --> 59:11.310
I just wanna go to prom
with my boyfriend

59:11.312 --> 59:13.513
to take pictures and enjoy
the last moment of high school

59:13.515 --> 59:15.082
like any other normal kid.

59:15.084 --> 59:17.183
Yeah, it's cliche,
but I don't care.

59:17.185 --> 59:20.754
Everything about high school
is cliche.

59:20.756 --> 59:24.160
Especially the part about the popular
girls being human garbage fires.

59:27.863 --> 59:30.033
Look, I promise,
this is for the best.

59:30.899 --> 59:32.533
Now you can go
to your art show.

59:34.602 --> 59:36.937
Look, I won't
rat you guys out.

59:36.939 --> 59:38.337
But with everything
you have planned,

59:38.339 --> 59:40.477
Just don't ruin prom
for me, okay?

59:45.948 --> 59:47.281
Are you done
with your fight?

59:47.283 --> 59:48.251
Can we go now?

59:55.024 --> 59:56.857
Hey, rage monster,
what's going on in here?

59:56.859 --> 59:58.024
What do you care?

59:58.026 --> 59:59.692
I care that you're
destroying the house.

59:59.694 --> 01:00:01.962
You're about to go off to
college and never look back.

01:00:01.964 --> 01:00:03.199
I still live here.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.138
Maddy went to prom
with Kane.

01:00:08.803 --> 01:00:11.205
Oh!

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.906
Well, that makes sense.
Kane's awesome.

01:00:12.908 --> 01:00:14.441
Are you serious
right now?

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:16.276
Yeah, I'm serious.
He's way cooler than you.

01:00:16.278 --> 01:00:17.444
Oh!

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:21.180
Cole, I'm sorry. I know
how you feel about Maddy.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:23.216
If I was 25 years younger,
I'd wanna hit that, too.

01:00:23.218 --> 01:00:25.852
- Dad!
- And I know about your prom plans.

01:00:25.854 --> 01:00:28.154
- How?
- You left your blueprints out.

01:00:28.156 --> 01:00:31.725
- They were in my room.
- Yeah, out... in your room.

01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:34.761
Okay? You know, sometimes I
come in here and I hang out.

01:00:34.763 --> 01:00:36.430
Pretend I'm not an adult
with a job,

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.868
the responsibilities...
It's very stress relieving.

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.000
Oh, my God.

01:00:41.002 --> 01:00:42.669
Sometimes I think what
it would be like to go back

01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.207
and make different
choices, too.

01:00:49.444 --> 01:00:50.513
You're being weird.

01:00:51.613 --> 01:00:53.113
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:54.584
I was doing it for her.

01:00:57.285 --> 01:00:58.252
Maybe.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.022
But you were doing it for
the other kids, too.

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.256
Ever since you were
a little boy,

01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:04.861
you were always much nicer
to people than I ever was.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.362
I admire that.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.133
You're being nice.
What's happening?

01:01:14.169 --> 01:01:16.473
Maybe you didn't notice,
I'm kind of a dick.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.971
- Well...
- No, don't argue!

01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:20.941
I know it's true.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:23.576
Which is why you have to
see your plan through.

01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:25.113
So people like Kane

01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:27.550
don't become like me.

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.019
I have so much regret

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.589
when I think about
how I treated people.

01:01:34.756 --> 01:01:36.622
Oh, God.
What I did at prom.

01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:38.725
But you were prom king.

01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:40.928
You were popular,
had tons of friends.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.796
I've seen the portrait.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.937
Yeah, but I was an asshole.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.306
Which is why your mom
eventually left me.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.546
Prom king was
the highlight of my life.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.615
Except for you.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.216
There was...

01:02:03.218 --> 01:02:06.386
supposed to be like
a sweet moment, but...

01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:07.290
- Yeah, so...
- Oh.

01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:09.156
Cool.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.059
Yeah.

01:02:11.225 --> 01:02:13.495
So what happened
at your prom?

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:18.131
It wasn't my finest hour,
that's for sure.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:19.499
Attention!

01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:20.566
Attention, everyone.

01:02:20.568 --> 01:02:24.370
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:02:24.372 --> 01:02:27.040
This is the crowning
of this year's

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.841
prom king and queen.

01:02:28.843 --> 01:02:31.548
Murphy Dadner and
Christine Likinfelt.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:36.549
Not!

01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:41.053
Did you see the look
on their faces?

01:02:41.055 --> 01:02:42.756
I'm the prom king.

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.691
Obviously.

01:02:44.693 --> 01:02:46.493
I'm gonna go
get laid, all right?

01:02:46.495 --> 01:02:48.227
'Night, losers.

01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:50.529
You did that
to Maddy's parents?

01:02:50.531 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah, and then I bought the
house right next to them,

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.834
so I could torment them
indefinitely.

01:02:54.836 --> 01:02:56.903
That's insane!

01:02:56.905 --> 01:02:58.238
Why don't you stop?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.740
Because...

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.611
nobody sabotaged my prom.

01:03:02.944 --> 01:03:04.111
Dad, you're reaching.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.013
If someone had
ruined my prom,

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:08.048
I'd be much less
of an asshole,

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.482
we'd live in a nicer house,

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:12.252
and your mom wouldn't have
abandoned you.

01:03:12.254 --> 01:03:13.453
I'm begging you.

01:03:13.455 --> 01:03:15.221
Destroy that prom.

01:03:15.223 --> 01:03:17.459
You'd be doing everybody
a huge favor.

01:03:20.729 --> 01:03:22.595
Good talk.

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:41.911
Whoo!

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:44.076
Hello, students,

01:04:44.078 --> 01:04:47.814
and welcome to the best
night of your lives.

01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:50.053
Prom! Whoo! Whoo!

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.888
Whoo! Whoo!

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:57.156
Seriously, you'll be lucky
if you can top it.

01:04:57.158 --> 01:05:01.761
Oh, and don't forget to vote
for your prom king and queen.

01:05:01.763 --> 01:05:04.230
Oh, and don't forget to
wear a condom...

01:05:04.232 --> 01:05:05.397
or pull out.

01:05:05.399 --> 01:05:06.566
Whatever.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:08.037
Have a great night.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.435
Whoo wee!

01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:11.504
So, guys, I spiked
the punch bowl.

01:05:11.506 --> 01:05:12.638
Just like a little bit.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.877
- Are we good to go?
- Yeah.

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.477
The voting in for
prom queen and king

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:20.580
is said to guarantee
Marissa and Kane win.

01:05:20.582 --> 01:05:23.683
And we are totally ready to
Carrie them with paint.

01:05:23.685 --> 01:05:25.551
That reference is
so played out.

01:05:25.553 --> 01:05:28.187
Can't we call it wrecking
them from <i>Degrassi?</i>

01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:31.258
Oh, my gosh, do not
reference that stupid show.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.292
Who cares what
we call it?

01:05:33.294 --> 01:05:34.928
All right? We just have
to make sure

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:36.566
that they're both up there
at the same time.

01:05:37.399 --> 01:05:38.401
Where's Dadner?

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.569
She's out.

01:05:41.336 --> 01:05:43.303
That pidge.

01:05:43.305 --> 01:05:45.171
Well, the proverbial jig
is up, my friends.

01:05:45.173 --> 01:05:47.774
Why am I even at prom?
I didn't want to come to prom.

01:05:47.776 --> 01:05:48.908
Hey!

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.144
We don't need Maddy
to validate this.

01:05:51.146 --> 01:05:52.444
All those people out there,

01:05:52.446 --> 01:05:54.848
just want their perfect
high school memories

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.783
to their perfect
high school life.

01:05:56.785 --> 01:05:59.218
We can't let that
happen again.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.921
So let's go out there
and give them

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:05.725
just a small taste of what they've
done to each and every one of us.

01:06:05.727 --> 01:06:08.361
You guys ready to make this
a prom they will never forget?

01:06:08.363 --> 01:06:09.962
- Yeah.
- Hell, yes.

01:06:09.964 --> 01:06:11.964
I'm so turned on
right now.

01:06:11.966 --> 01:06:13.332
Come on, guys,
let's bring it in.

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:14.936
- All right, here we go.
- Whoo!

01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:16.970
One, two, three!

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.772
- We are Groot!
- What?

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.607
- All right, all right.
- So many options.

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:21.875
One, two, three!

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:22.875
Holler G.

01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:24.477
- Oh, my God.
- Goodness gracious.

01:06:24.479 --> 01:06:25.812
Come on, guys...

01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:28.080
We go bass side?

01:06:28.082 --> 01:06:30.886
Okay, I think
we should stop.

01:06:52.506 --> 01:06:53.909
Can I cut in?

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.808
Leave us alone, Marissa.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:56.942
Are you kidding me?

01:06:56.944 --> 01:06:58.481
You forgive him and not me?

01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.413
F this.

01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:03.482
Hey, babe.

01:07:03.484 --> 01:07:05.588
I have something
special for you.

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:08.324
It's over here.

01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:10.490
What's so funny?

01:07:10.492 --> 01:07:11.625
Nothing.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.593
Nothing at all.

01:07:13.595 --> 01:07:15.430
- Punch?
- Yeah, whatever.

01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:31.379
Here you go.

01:07:36.151 --> 01:07:37.086
All right.

01:07:38.886 --> 01:07:40.787
All ready.

01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:42.091
Okay, hand me the flashlight.

01:07:47.828 --> 01:07:49.194
Uh...

01:07:49.196 --> 01:07:51.932
I wish I'd have met
you sooner.

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:55.067
I would have given anything to have a
friend like this the past four years.

01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:57.039
I wish we would have
met sooner, too.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:00.943
And, Efraim,

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:02.912
it's okay to look.

01:08:03.377 --> 01:08:04.576
No, seriously.

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:06.147
Look right now.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.618
Now plug in the HD mic cord
and let's get out of here.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.923
Got it.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:15.925
All right.

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:22.930
What are you
staring at, Sweats?

01:08:26.568 --> 01:08:27.602
Oh, my God!

01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:49.421
Oh, you're gay.

01:08:49.423 --> 01:08:50.290
Yo, bro, are you gay?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.858
No, you're
out of the clique.

01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:56.028
Girl, you're straight?

01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:57.429
Get out of the clique.

01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:05.638
Hey, now. Hey, now.
Everything is still okay.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.008
Just calm down.

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:09.242
Now then,

01:09:09.243 --> 01:09:12.245
let's watch your life
in memories.

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:13.246
The best memories

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:15.451
that any of you
will ever have.

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:17.550
Ever.

01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:18.718
Hit it.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:39.442
I have to admit. This feels
pretty good, Efraim.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:42.975
Efraim?

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:59.392
Guys. It's not...

01:09:59.394 --> 01:10:00.893
It is not me.

01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:04.099
It's me, all right,
but it's not my penis.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.532
It's not my penis!

01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:23.452
You realize you're probably gonna get
arrested for distributing porn, right?

01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:25.785
Worth it.

01:10:25.787 --> 01:10:28.054
Oh, no. You are coming
with me, little man.

01:10:28.056 --> 01:10:30.126
No, I can't be
touched by a girl.

01:10:34.695 --> 01:10:35.929
Well...

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:38.267
We will never be able
to unsee that.

01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:42.202
Which might not
be a bad thing.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.504
All right, all you crazy kids.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.939
Voting is officially closed.

01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:49.008
It's time to find out
our king and queen.

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.643
What the hell
are you doing?

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:52.112
Going against
my better judgment.

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:54.279
I know you're still
in love with me.

01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:55.482
Sorry, though.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.986
No happy ending for us.
I'm saving that for Maddy.

01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:02.023
You can be
such an asshole.

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.425
Wanting to be with
my girlfriend

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.527
when we win king and queen
makes me an asshole?

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.394
You're the one trying to
get with me right now.

01:11:09.396 --> 01:11:11.563
Okay, first of all,
in your dreams.

01:11:11.565 --> 01:11:14.666
And second, I know you're
not an asshole, Kane.

01:11:14.668 --> 01:11:16.536
You just mastered
acting like one.

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:18.770
As a former prom queen,

01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:21.573
this is a moment that
you never forget.

01:11:21.575 --> 01:11:23.475
It symbolizes
an entire school

01:11:23.477 --> 01:11:27.382
coming together and agreeing
upon one thing.

01:11:27.882 --> 01:11:29.448
Popularity.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:32.152
You know, I remember when you weren't
such a complete douche lick.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:35.223
And somewhere in my
cold, dead heart, I...

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:40.693
I still want my last
memories with you

01:11:40.695 --> 01:11:42.895
to be something more
than just terrible.

01:11:42.897 --> 01:11:44.867
Let's reveal this thing.

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.404
I know how I left
you for Maddy was shitty.

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:50.435
Then why did you do it?

01:11:50.437 --> 01:11:51.804
Because I had to.

01:11:51.806 --> 01:11:53.673
No, you didn't.

01:11:53.675 --> 01:11:57.210
You could have just broken up
with me like a normal person.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:12:00.846
Instead of giving in to all the
pressures of becoming king jock

01:12:00.848 --> 01:12:03.148
and kicking me to the curb
like some stray dog.

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.652
This year's
king and queen are...

01:12:06.654 --> 01:12:08.123
Can I get a drumroll?

01:12:09.056 --> 01:12:10.089
Now...

01:12:10.091 --> 01:12:12.425
Okay, I'll do it myself.

01:12:15.163 --> 01:12:17.130
I mean, whatever happened
to that sweet kid

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.499
that used to ask permission
to kiss me?

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.100
Who used to give me
rubber bands every day

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:23.870
because you knew
I liked to play with them.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.805
Not surprisingly...

01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:28.474
Maddy and Kane!

01:12:29.543 --> 01:12:31.678
Are you kidding me!

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.911
I gotta go.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:34.115
Trust me...

01:12:34.615 --> 01:12:35.551
you don't want to.

01:12:41.522 --> 01:12:43.656
What the hell, guys? That
was supposed to be Marissa.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:55.971
Enjoy it...

01:12:58.038 --> 01:12:59.072
Wow.

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.740
This is a surprise.

01:13:00.742 --> 01:13:02.008
Okay, this was
all Maddy's idea.

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.878
She does not deserve
our judgment.

01:13:04.745 --> 01:13:06.011
Wow, Cole.

01:13:06.013 --> 01:13:07.315
That was very big of you.

01:13:07.748 --> 01:13:09.148
Yeah, very big.

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.220
This is something
I've always wanted.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.254
Uh, Kane?

01:13:15.489 --> 01:13:16.889
Where is Kane?

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:18.858
Be a good guy, Cole.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.596
You're a bigger man than
either one of us are.

01:13:22.596 --> 01:13:23.565
Mutey, hit it.

01:13:32.507 --> 01:13:33.609
Saved you.

01:13:43.918 --> 01:13:45.652
That dress is wrecked.

01:13:57.097 --> 01:13:58.867
Now you know
what it feels like...

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:00.933
assholes.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.087
How could you
do this to me?

01:14:22.089 --> 01:14:23.958
I never did anything
to you.

01:14:25.493 --> 01:14:27.626
It wasn't supposed to
go down like that.

01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:29.194
It wasn't supposed
to be you.

01:14:29.196 --> 01:14:31.397
You blame your entire
shitty high school experience

01:14:31.399 --> 01:14:34.334
on me as if you being
a loser is my fault.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.568
You just stood on the
sidelines judging me,

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:37.905
thinking you were better
than me.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.377
Right. I'm sorry.

01:14:43.744 --> 01:14:45.346
Sorry's not good enough.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.588
Are you kidding me?

01:14:53.421 --> 01:14:54.586
Tighty lives.

01:14:55.656 --> 01:14:57.122
Tighty's back!

01:15:07.735 --> 01:15:09.305
Enough!

01:15:11.439 --> 01:15:12.441
I'm sorry, Maddy.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.342
But this is all on you.

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:15.808
What?

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:17.577
I didn't even
do anything.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:18.547
Exactly.

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.147
You never do anything.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.982
Which is exactly why
guys like Kane

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:24.884
think it's okay to
torment us endlessly.

01:15:24.886 --> 01:15:27.719
Because there are no
consequences to their actions.

01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:28.854
You stay their friend.

01:15:28.856 --> 01:15:30.022
You go to their parties.

01:15:30.024 --> 01:15:31.523
You become their girlfriend
or boyfriend.

01:15:31.525 --> 01:15:34.393
You stand idly by like
citizens of a war who believe

01:15:34.395 --> 01:15:36.962
they have no blame
for the atrocities

01:15:36.964 --> 01:15:38.167
that happen in high school.

01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:40.869
So, yeah,
we ruined your night.

01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:43.038
So what?

01:15:44.739 --> 01:15:46.107
We didn't
shoot up the school,

01:15:47.074 --> 01:15:48.510
none of us
committed suicide.

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:50.910
Even though we may
have thought of it

01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:52.347
just because of the way
you treat us.

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:55.180
And the saddest
part is that

01:15:55.182 --> 01:15:57.218
most of us just wish
you liked us.

01:16:00.154 --> 01:16:01.489
We even fall in love
with you.

01:16:03.857 --> 01:16:05.561
We all grew up together.

01:16:07.328 --> 01:16:08.861
The only people
in our entire lives

01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:10.462
we'll be able to
say that about.

01:16:10.464 --> 01:16:13.465
And here we are, using all these
new forms of communication

01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:14.700
not to bring us all together,

01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:17.202
but to rip each other apart.

01:16:17.204 --> 01:16:19.104
Movies have been made
for decades

01:16:19.106 --> 01:16:21.506
about how cruel we are
to each other.

01:16:21.508 --> 01:16:22.508
And we can relate.

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.046
Just nothing ever happens.

01:16:25.446 --> 01:16:28.281
High school is just
a popularity contest.

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.916
But for some reason,
that's not good enough.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.554
So we created an actual
popularity contest...

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:36.188
for prom king and queen.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:38.926
To verify just how unpopular
the rest of us are.

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.197
What is up with that?

01:16:48.436 --> 01:16:49.405
Prom.

01:16:58.745 --> 01:17:00.047
Fuck the prom!

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.018
Yeah, fuck the prom.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.018
Fuck the prom!

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.553
Yeah, fuck the prom.

01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:08.754
Fuck the prom.

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:09.889
Fuck the prom.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:11.724
Fuck the prom.

01:17:11.726 --> 01:17:13.559
Fuck the prom.

01:17:13.561 --> 01:17:15.193
Fuck the prom.

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:16.696
Fuck the prom.

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.264
Fuck the prom.

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:19.799
Fuck the prom.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.533
Fuck the prom.

01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:22.902
Fuck the prom.

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.603
Fuck the prom.

01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:26.005
Fuck the prom.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.596
Wait, can we have a second?

01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:50.098
Make it quick.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.168
I knew this would happen.

01:17:54.668 --> 01:17:56.001
We didn't even
get to dance.

01:17:56.003 --> 01:17:57.169
I've told you.

01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:59.040
I'm shomer. I can't...

01:18:02.276 --> 01:18:03.709
All right,
that's enough.

01:18:03.711 --> 01:18:04.844
That's enough.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.580
Back up. Back up.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:10.118
You're gonna be in the sex offender
list for the rest of your life, kid.

01:18:10.717 --> 01:18:12.186
Definitely worth it.

01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:23.865
Do you wanna dance?

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:27.336
Sure.

01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.736
No. I'm sorry.
Can't... Can't do it.

01:18:30.738 --> 01:18:31.906
Nope, can't do it.

01:18:36.543 --> 01:18:37.546
Felicity.

01:18:39.713 --> 01:18:40.915
Felicity.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.186
Felicity Stufts.

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:49.091
You don't respond to
your own name anymore?

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:53.028
Well, no one's called
me that since...

01:18:53.994 --> 01:18:56.297
Well, you.

01:18:58.565 --> 01:18:59.867
Dance with me, Felicity.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.220
You wanna dance?

01:19:22.222 --> 01:19:23.389
Yes!

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.560
Let's go.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.128
Cole, can we talk?

01:19:38.972 --> 01:19:41.008
Moments like these
should remain unfiltered.

01:19:41.642 --> 01:19:42.843
Right?

01:20:20.181 --> 01:20:21.947
Well, they let me out
on probation,

01:20:21.949 --> 01:20:24.483
but I'm on the sex offenders
list indefinitely.

01:20:24.485 --> 01:20:26.518
Let's discuss the fact
that we're trending.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.620
Fuck the prom.

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:28.720
So awesome.

01:20:28.722 --> 01:20:30.322
Why wasn't I
speaking before?

01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:32.191
Oh, my God.
Maddy's hair.

01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:33.628
This is
the same hairstyle...

01:20:35.762 --> 01:20:37.129
That hair, though.

01:20:37.131 --> 01:20:39.234
The hair, it's the same!

01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:57.119
Dadner.

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:07.529
Cole, wait.

01:21:10.964 --> 01:21:14.069
Just give him a few
more days to cool off.

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:17.001
Yeah.

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.773
Well, hello.

01:21:21.775 --> 01:21:23.108
To what do I
owe the pleasure?

01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:25.044
Is Cole here?

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:28.080
He's probably up playing
68 sided dice game somewhere.

01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:30.318
Perfect. Can I come in?
I'm looking for something.

01:21:30.818 --> 01:21:32.184
Yeah.

01:21:32.186 --> 01:21:33.919
Oh, and do you know what
school Cole's art show is for?

01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:35.222
I don't care.

01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:56.544
Cole Reed.

01:21:57.244 --> 01:21:58.245
Yeah!

01:21:59.413 --> 01:22:01.045
<i>Kane Heely.</i>

01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:02.483
<i>Felicity Stufts.</i>

01:22:03.117 --> 01:22:04.683
<i>TJ...</i>

01:22:04.685 --> 01:22:06.354
<i>Brian Hertsenburg.</i>

01:22:07.221 --> 01:22:08.953
<i>Larry Max.</i>

01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:10.688
<i>Abby Klein.</i>

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:12.758
Emile Clan.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.460
Also, I love talking.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:15.795
Whoo!

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:17.729
Maddy "the bomb" Dadner.

01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:18.863
Whoo!

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.367
That's my girl!

01:22:22.369 --> 01:22:24.135
You know, you may have cleaned
up your act a little bit,

01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:25.603
but I still think
you're weird.

01:22:25.605 --> 01:22:26.874
Oh, said the lonely perv.

01:22:27.374 --> 01:22:28.573
True.

01:22:34.781 --> 01:22:36.215
So you got in.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.148
So I did.

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.253
When do you leave?

01:22:39.887 --> 01:22:41.252
Right now.

01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:43.221
Yeah, it starts
this weekend.

01:22:43.223 --> 01:22:45.925
Are we gonna make
one of those stupid

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.863
high-school-best-friend-pacts
to keep in touch?

01:22:48.729 --> 01:22:50.161
I mean, if that's what
you need to

01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:52.264
protect your
vulnerable feelings.

01:22:52.266 --> 01:22:53.732
Me? Vulnerable?

01:22:53.734 --> 01:22:56.835
Mr. I-Made-A-Speech-At-Prom-
With-My-Pants-Around-My-Ankles.

01:22:56.837 --> 01:23:01.242
Says Ms. I-Saved-My-Ex-Bf-
Who-Used-To-Give-Me-Rubber-Bands.

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:03.444
Shut up.

01:23:05.712 --> 01:23:07.712
Thank you for...

01:23:07.714 --> 01:23:09.950
not making high school
completely suck.

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:13.855
Are we supposed to
hug now or something?

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.295
All right, guys.
Selfie time.

01:23:21.294 --> 01:23:22.827
I thought once your
hair got boring

01:23:22.829 --> 01:23:24.263
you didn't care
about selfies, Dadner.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.200
Shut up and
get in the picture.

01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:29.568
Sorry, I'm out.

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:30.635
Wait, what?

01:23:30.637 --> 01:23:31.703
How come?

01:23:31.705 --> 01:23:33.175
- Okay.
- Gotta go.

01:23:34.507 --> 01:23:35.773
Dude, you're just
gonna leave?

01:23:35.775 --> 01:23:36.774
Leave me hanging?

01:23:36.776 --> 01:23:38.309
Come on. Come on, Cole.

01:23:38.311 --> 01:23:39.446
Cole.

01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:42.982
I gotta go, guys.

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:45.220
- Maddy, come on.
- Gosh.

01:23:45.753 --> 01:23:47.252
Cole...

01:23:47.254 --> 01:23:50.188
Dude, I don't know how you
haven't figured this out yet,

01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:53.060
but Maddy's the whole reason
you got into art school.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.327
What are you talking about?

01:23:55.329 --> 01:23:58.130
She was the one that sent your
portfolio to Head of Admissions.

01:23:58.132 --> 01:23:59.631
How do you not
know this?

01:23:59.633 --> 01:24:00.899
Because nobody
told me that.

01:24:00.901 --> 01:24:04.103
Oh, my God.
You are such a dumb boy.

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.274
Thank God I'm off to college
where real men await.

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.209
What am I supposed
to do?

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.312
Thank her?

01:24:20.654 --> 01:24:21.956
Hey.

01:24:22.656 --> 01:24:23.925
Can we talk?

01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:27.162
Yeah, of course.

01:24:28.095 --> 01:24:30.895
I owe you
a huge thank you.

01:24:30.897 --> 01:24:32.997
Huh. For what?

01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:35.470
Being a terrible friend,
or for ruining your prom?

01:24:38.105 --> 01:24:39.574
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

01:24:42.743 --> 01:24:46.111
Cole, you're one of the most
incredible people I've ever met.

01:24:46.113 --> 01:24:48.350
Not to mention hands down
most talented.

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.683
I could't live with myself

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.520
if you didn't make it into your
dream school because of me.

01:24:59.293 --> 01:25:00.262
What's this?

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.362
A going away present.

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.634
But you're the one moving.
Should I have given you a gift?

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.168
You already have.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.437
Come on, open it.

01:25:50.511 --> 01:25:52.013
It says you love me.

01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:55.950
Is that real, or is that
just the story?

01:25:57.851 --> 01:25:59.086
It's not fiction.

01:26:13.967 --> 01:26:15.235
We shouldn't...

01:26:17.771 --> 01:26:19.004
Can't you stay till
the end of summer,

01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:20.208
before school starts?

01:26:21.007 --> 01:26:22.109
I don't think so.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:26.511
Things got so intense
between us so quickly,

01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:29.117
I think it might be best
if we're just friends.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.589
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:26:41.395 --> 01:26:43.397
Do you think college will
be easier than high school?

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.168
I hope so.

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.841
So, what do we do now?

01:27:11.869 --> 01:27:16.869
