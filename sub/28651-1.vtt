01:35.162 --> 01:36.395
Hey guys.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.397
Daddy!

01:39.133 --> 01:40.999
Hey, come here!

01:41.001 --> 01:42.301
Oh, muah, muah, muah.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.405
Daddy, don't forget
to give Maddie a kiss.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.290
Who's Maddie?

01:48.291 --> 01:50.174
She's the most beautiful
princess in the land.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.944
Yeah, well I know a princess

01:51.946 --> 01:54.346
that is far more
beautiful than she.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.180
Really?

01:55.182 --> 01:56.014
Yeah.

01:56.016 --> 01:56.849
Who?

01:56.851 --> 01:57.683
It's a secret.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.517
Tell me.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.202
Okay, she's beautiful.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.886
She's got long brown
hair, bright blue eyes.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.889
She loves the color teal.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.525
And she's very, very afraid
of the tickle monster!

02:06.527 --> 02:08.092
The tickle monster.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.930
Hey bud.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.499
Hey Dad.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.200
Why's the front door open?

02:15.202 --> 02:17.035
Mom's cooking again.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.570
Oh.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.573
Yup, she's cussin'
like a sailor in there.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.476
Alright guys, I'm gonna go in,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.078
I'm gonna do some
damage control,

02:26.080 --> 02:28.247
and if I'm not back
in 10 minutes,

02:28.249 --> 02:29.248
call Grandma.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.250
Okay.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.255
Damn it.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.400
Ow!

02:48.402 --> 02:49.701
Shit!

02:49.703 --> 02:52.137
Well, it looks like the
chicken's done.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.543
You okay?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.415
Hi, can I have a
large pizza please?

03:04.218 --> 03:06.585
Half cheese and half pepperoni.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.221
Uh, yes, I guess garlic bread.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.290
You don't have to do that,
I can whip somethin' up.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.425
No, no, I'll pick
it up myself.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.826
15 minutes, great.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.828
Thanks.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.798
You haven't cooked in years.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.500
Yeah, but you don't
have to go pick it up,

03:21.502 --> 03:22.334
we can have it delivered.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.336
Right?

03:25.573 --> 03:27.472
I gotta get outta this house.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.583
Who
will become

03:37.585 --> 03:38.984
America's most talented new act?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.186
Results, when we return
with Million Dollar...

03:41.188 --> 03:42.588
I'm sorry this took so long,

03:42.590 --> 03:44.590
they messed it up and had to
remake it.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.901
Is Mommy mad?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.337
No, honey, Mommy's fine.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.139
She looks mad.

04:01.842 --> 04:02.674
Okay, kids.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.609
It's time for bed.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.510
But we don't know who won yet.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.345
Bed, now.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.446
We're gonna watch it tomorrow.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.448
Come on.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.167
Catherine.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.538
Catherine.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.241
Catherine, you awake?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.247
Hi,
I'm Josh Grobon,

05:49.249 --> 05:52.284
and I wanna thank you for
listening to this audio cassette.

05:52.286 --> 05:56.421
You should be proud of yourself
for taking the first steps

05:56.423 --> 05:58.190
to finding your inner happiness.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.192
Nope.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.433
True happiness
comes from taking small

06:08.435 --> 06:12.537
and effective steps toward
becoming the man or woman

06:12.539 --> 06:14.373
who you wanna be.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.708
You can have happiness
and in fact,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.744
I would say you
deserve happiness.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.680
Now is the time
to figure out what feeds you

06:21.682 --> 06:24.182
and throw away the
things that don't.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.817
If it doesn't motivate you,

06:25.819 --> 06:28.220
if it doesn't allow you
to grow anymore,

06:28.222 --> 06:31.690
it's time to let it go
and move forward.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.691
Guess what?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.360
You have to start today.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.829
If not today, then when?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.178
Come in!

06:53.180 --> 06:55.180
Ho ho!

06:55.181 --> 06:57.181
Hide the pornography, your
new boss is in the house.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.217
You got a second?

06:59.219 --> 07:01.186
Yeah, I was just about
to take my lunch break.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.188
Have a seat.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.625
Mm, Tony's.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.293
I like that place.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.295
Yeah, me too.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.144
What can I do for you, Nick?

07:26.146 --> 07:28.613
Oh, you know I just wanted to
make sure

07:28.615 --> 07:30.816
there wasn't any
hostility between us.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.152
You know, with me getting
the promotion and all.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.654
You know?

07:35.656 --> 07:36.855
Thanks Nick.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.923
Of course.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.659
Well, I appreciate you
coming in,

07:40.661 --> 07:41.793
but we're good.

07:52.039 --> 07:56.808
Oh yeah, by the way, you
have another field trip today.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.109
Fourth graders this time.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.146
Joy.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.750
So basically, the water
and waste are separated.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.086
After that's completed, it
goes to the filtration system,

08:08.088 --> 08:09.088
where it's...

08:11.258 --> 08:13.358
After that's completed, it
goes to the filtration system,

08:13.360 --> 08:14.360
where it's...

08:18.165 --> 08:21.900
Goes to the filtration
system, where it's...

08:26.607 --> 08:28.607
You need to stop that
and take your class back.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.609
I'm done.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.582
Where are you goin'?

08:37.583 --> 08:38.482
I'm outta here.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.650
Man, what about the children?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.852
I quit!

08:43.857 --> 08:46.091
Alright, bro, you do you.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.200
I did it, I did it.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.202
Hold on, man.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.572
Okay, what'd you do?

09:00.574 --> 09:01.406
Is that sweat?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.240
Did you run a marathon?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.775
What's going on down there?

09:03.776 --> 09:05.309
No, I'm trying to fix
the sink, the plumbing.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.078
There's something wrong with it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.880
Okay, come on, tell me,
what'd you do?

09:08.882 --> 09:09.882
I quit my job.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.551
You quit your job?

09:12.553 --> 09:13.902
Just now.

09:13.903 --> 09:15.252
Whoa, 10 minutes ago,
but you get it.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.621
Obviously.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.455
I feel...

09:17.457 --> 09:18.490
I feel liberated.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.091
Hit me with a beer.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.427
Dude, Catherine's
gonna kill you.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.562
What?

09:23.563 --> 09:24.696
Why would you say that,
why would you just assume

09:24.698 --> 09:26.264
that I didn't run it
by her first?

09:26.266 --> 09:27.266
Well, did you?

09:29.303 --> 09:30.303
No.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.472
It was that tape that
you gave me.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.906
Ah, you finally
listened to it, huh?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.107
Yeah, I did.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.093
You know, I never quite realized

09:38.094 --> 09:40.078
how miserable I was at my job,
just bored out of my mind.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.746
It used to feed me,
but it doesn't feed me,

09:41.748 --> 09:42.814
not anymore.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.848
I see.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.683
Catherine knows that.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.617
She'll understand.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.651
She will.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.653
If you say so.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.522
She will.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.860
God, you quit your job, Steve.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.530
How can you make a decision
that affects both of our lives

09:58.532 --> 10:00.498
and not even run it by me?

10:00.500 --> 10:01.333
I know, I just...

10:01.335 --> 10:03.234
You are so
selfish.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.070
I wasn't happy Catherine.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.855
I hated that job.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.639
It was the most pathetic I've
ever felt in my entire life.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.808
And you knew that.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.076
Yeah, I did.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.877
You've been mopin' around
the house every morning

10:12.879 --> 10:14.713
for almost a year.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.947
You don't like your job?

10:15.949 --> 10:16.881
Fine, I get it.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.416
But who does?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.884
What, you just woke
up this morning,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.853
and you decided to
do something crazy?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.889
God, have you seen the bills,
Steve?

10:24.891 --> 10:25.724
Yes!

10:25.726 --> 10:27.242
Great!

10:27.243 --> 10:28.759
Then you've seen that we can't
pay 'em.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.729
This wasn't about the money.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.831
Logan wants
to play soccer,

10:32.833 --> 10:34.499
that costs money.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.601
Are you gonna tell him that he
can't play?

10:36.603 --> 10:38.036
Or does that land on me?

10:39.039 --> 10:41.740
I hate being the bad guy.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.845
I have sacrificed so much
for you and this family.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.163
I know you have.

10:48.164 --> 10:49.480
I wanted to work, do you
remember that?

10:49.483 --> 10:50.448
Yeah.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.084
But you wanted to be
the bread winner.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.252
And what?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.887
Now you've changed your mind?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.622
You don't want
that role anymore?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.958
God, I can't handle this.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.827
I cannot handle your
midlife crisis right now.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.662
My midlife crisis.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.496
Yes.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.897
I can't keep doing this.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.266
What?

11:18.478 --> 11:21.112
Steve, I want a divorce.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.817
What?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.252
I don't want this anymore.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.026
But I love you.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.931
Doesn't matter.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.169
You and I,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.972
we're not happy people anymore.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.727
So we'll talk tomorrow, then?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.667
So I told you guys I
already got divorced.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.504
Wife got the kids.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.140
I get to see them about once a
week now.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.808
For like, an hour.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.710
About the same time
that you guys

12:58.711 --> 13:00.611
get to see your proctologist
every week.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.415
Anyway, it's not all bad,
cooking's really fun.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.818
Until you look up the recipe
and can't find a single serving

13:06.820 --> 13:08.386
when it's just for two people.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.622
Constant reminder.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.626
But, good news is, I don't
have to buy salts anymore.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.927
I can just use my tears.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.228
Dude, your phone's ringing.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.830
Who is it?

13:18.832 --> 13:20.765
It's your brother.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.134
Ignore it.

13:23.135 --> 13:23.700
My mother in law,
she's a really gem.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.203
Dude, it keeps on ringing.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.505
Can't you see I'm in the
middle of a set here, man?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.808
Just trying to do some
hecklers, am I right?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.009
Yeah.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.209
Yeah, she's been filling
my kids heads

13:32.212 --> 13:33.645
with all kinds of stuff.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.514
So to honor her, I got an M
tattooed on this butt cheek.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.687
Thank you, thank you,
you guys have been great.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.521
What?

13:43.523 --> 13:44.455
Mic drop.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.658
Dude, mics are
expensive, come on.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.493
Get off the stage.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.828
Here, come here.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.162
I love my fans, thank you.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.464
Hey, friend.

13:54.868 --> 13:55.667
What's up?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.501
Who are you?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.570
Oh, this is Sarah.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.738
And Sarah, this is Steve.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.740
Hi.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.844
Let me get you a drink.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.579
Hey, hey.

14:07.581 --> 14:08.581
Be nice.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.017
How you guys know each other
so well?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.386
Oh, I've known this one
since we were in diapers.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.688
We grew up down the
street from each other.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.190
Well, how come I
haven't seen you around?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.193
Sarah, just graduated
from college in the city.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.029
She was eager to leave us,
small town folks, behind.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.165
What did you study?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.401
Business administration and
management.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.369
Oh.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.538
Yeah, it's not as exciting as
it sounds.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.241
I never said it sounded
exciting.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.309
Oh.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.376
So you couldn't hack
it in the city,

14:38.378 --> 14:39.711
why'd you come back here?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.847
What's with the 20 questions?

14:42.849 --> 14:44.849
I'm just trying to figure
out what I'm working with here,

14:44.851 --> 14:46.918
'cause my man, you know...

14:46.920 --> 14:47.785
Steve.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.620
Stop.

14:48.622 --> 14:49.687
What, I got your back, buddy.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.521
Dude.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.823
Stop.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.726
This man holds a
special place in my heart.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.562
He took me in when
I was a lost puppy.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.131
And it was cold outside
and he gave me a home.

15:00.133 --> 15:00.965
And he is...

15:00.967 --> 15:02.367
Oh, please.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.035
Stop talking, okay.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.238
He has, since day one,
had my back.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.973
And you know what?

15:08.975 --> 15:11.776
I got his too.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.578
And you come in here all young
and smiley, like an angel,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.314
and I wanna make
sure you're not,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.583
as the great Elvis Presley
would say,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.184
the devil in disguise.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.020
R-I-P to the king.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.022
Let's start over.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.391
I'm Sarah, life long
friend of David.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.959
Went to college for the past
five years

15:27.961 --> 15:31.596
and today I officially just
joined the rest of my generation

15:31.598 --> 15:33.064
by moving back in
with my parents.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.066
So...

15:35.769 --> 15:36.651
That's exciting.

15:36.652 --> 15:37.534
It's nice to meet you, Sarah,
I'm Steve,

15:37.537 --> 15:38.670
David's new roommate.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.507
Well, not that you're
all friends.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.175
Cheers.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.578
Cheers!

15:50.417 --> 15:51.616
What was that?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.017
Yours was ginger ale.

15:53.019 --> 15:53.851
Why?

15:53.853 --> 15:55.403
Because I cut you off.

15:55.404 --> 15:56.954
You had too much
to drink tonight.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.423
Haven't you ever heard
of a water shot, genius?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.858
Carbonation like that
could kill a man.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.512
Is that funny?

16:04.513 --> 16:05.996
That's my queue, I'm gonna go
hit the hay.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.998
Hey, hey, hey.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.266
Aren't you gonna pay your bill?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.768
You know where I live.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.970
It's true, I do know
where he lives.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.159
What is...

16:38.264 --> 16:39.264
Oh, Connor.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.510
Hey!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.112
What do you think?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.482
It's an original.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.255
Connor!

17:04.257 --> 17:05.823
Can I talk to you?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.326
We're playin'...

17:11.263 --> 17:13.164
Five, five, five guys.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.905
Sup?

17:20.906 --> 17:23.140
Don't you think it's a
little early to be doing this?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.842
It is never too
early for music.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.011
You gotta do it when the
inspiration hits.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.180
To be honest, we gotta practice

17:29.182 --> 17:31.482
before Kyle's shift starts at
Shake Hut.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.650
Our town got a Shake Hut?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.719
Mhm, last week, pretty cool,
huh?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.287
Kyle gives us
his discount so...

17:36.289 --> 17:37.989
It's awesome.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.858
Okay, I'm afraid to ask.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.861
Does this happen every morning?

17:43.863 --> 17:47.832
When the adults are away,
the cool Cool Kats will play.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.700
Okay, well maybe you can
start a little later next time,

17:49.702 --> 17:51.936
give people a chance to wake up
in peace.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.372
Hmm, no can do, sorry.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.241
Alright boys,
break time is over.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.844
Let's give me two ones
and a bottle of brew.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.046
You're a jerk, Connor.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.681
I can't hear you.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.784
I swear you're adopted!

18:06.786 --> 18:07.786
Ha!

18:22.235 --> 18:25.303
We're not open yet,
sorry.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.141
We're not open, yet.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.009
Hey, Sarah, what's up?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.244
Hi.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.413
What are ya doing up there?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.948
That light was
flickering,

18:36.950 --> 18:38.516
but it looks like it's
working now.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.719
You must be my good luck charm.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.887
What's wrong?

18:42.889 --> 18:44.923
Everything okay?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.958
Yeah, just got woke up by
Connor and his stupid band.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.392
Oh, Cool Kats, nice.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.827
You know them?

18:49.828 --> 18:51.261
Yeah, they played here a
couple times.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.463
They're pretty good.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.698
And really loud.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.534
That too.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.403
Can I use your razor?

18:59.405 --> 19:00.938
Mine has some weird stuff on it.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.041
Dude, put some pants
on, this is a business.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.310
Calm down, you're not even
open yet.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.245
Sarah?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.813
Nice to see you again.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.647
Likewise.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.349
Dude, pants.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.683
Dude, razor.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.885
Second drawer on the left.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.070
Thank you.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.254
And turn the oven
off this time.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.488
I will!

19:17.490 --> 19:18.389
God.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.857
He will not stop cooking.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.492
I mean, there's dishes
everywhere.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.061
How hard is it to put
a dish in a dishwasher?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.166
So, how long have you
two been together?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.268
Hilarious, Sarah.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.678
Anyways, what are you doing
for the rest of the day?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.642
I don't know, was hoping to
hang out here for little bit.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.943
Yeah?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.243
You're just gonna hang
out at the bar with me?

19:40.246 --> 19:41.445
Is that okay?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.047
Yeah, fine with me.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.017
Cool.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.990
Hey, man, you want a drink?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.825
I have to pack,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.726
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you
mean pack?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.361
Where you going?

19:57.363 --> 19:59.063
I have to go to
California tomorrow,

19:59.065 --> 20:01.165
pick up my dad and move
him back here.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.300
I thought your brother
was taking care of him?

20:02.302 --> 20:03.351
So did I.

20:03.352 --> 20:04.401
But apparently, he's
got better things to do.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.070
Oh, man.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.206
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.307
This is my brother we're
talking about,

20:09.309 --> 20:10.641
I should've seen this coming.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.376
Hey, if there's
anything I can do to help,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.277
let me know, okay?

20:13.279 --> 20:14.979
Thank you.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.416
Is he gonna be okay?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.130
Where are you going?

20:33.132 --> 20:36.734
I am going to audition for
Million Dollar Entertainer.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.736
What?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.838
Million Dollar Entertainer,
the TV show.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.607
No, I know the TV show.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.809
What, you and the Cool Kats?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.612
No, screw the Cool Kats
they're a bunch of losers.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.514
Wow, that's a complete
change from this morning.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.983
Well yeah, well, I
thought we were gonna miss

20:51.985 --> 20:54.151
the local auditions because
Kyle had a shift at Shake Hut.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.836
But apparently that's not true.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.520
Apparently it's because
nobody thinks

20:57.523 --> 20:58.522
we can make it into anything

20:58.524 --> 21:00.691
other than a band in
my parent's basement.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.527
Well, maybe they're right.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.562
You too?

21:04.564 --> 21:05.896
Ha, well you know what?

21:05.898 --> 21:07.665
I'm letting any of
ya hold me back.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.700
I'm going to California,
auditions are in LA.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.370
Three days from now,
I'm gonna be there.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.105
Connor, this is ridiculous.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.373
Have you even told Mom and Dad.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.841
Yes, I did.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.242
I texted them this morning.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.479
And Mom said, and I quote,
have fun,

21:21.481 --> 21:24.048
make sure Sarah takes
care of RoX.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.750
You have to take care
of the dog.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.985
This is crazy.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.654
You can't go to a city
like that by yourself.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.589
Yeah, well I am.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.792
Unless, you want to
come with me.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.060
That's even crazier.

21:36.062 --> 21:36.894
Yeah?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.429
What are you doing these days,

21:38.430 --> 21:40.150
Miss business administration
and management?

21:41.934 --> 21:42.767
Whoa.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.219
You could be my manager.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.670
I mean, your professors did
think you were start enough

21:45.672 --> 21:47.872
to graduate, and you
are my sister.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.807
So I guess I can trust you.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.941
Aw, thank you.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.410
I actually need some
help with travel costs.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.944
So it's more like a

21:53.946 --> 21:56.881
somewhat costly adventure
with some learning involved.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.449
How you gettin' there?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.653
I haven't totally thought
that one through yet.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.892
Do you know anyone
going to California?

22:11.831 --> 22:12.831
Do you?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.173
Hey, thank you for driving us.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.240
That was really nice of you.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.608
Thank David, he made me.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.211
Okay.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.813
Will do.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.082
It's my payment for
crashing in his place.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.851
Thank you, David.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.955
David just sent me
a picture of Rox.

22:37.957 --> 22:38.957
Oh, let me see.

22:41.961 --> 22:42.961
Aw, how cute.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.800
Typical girls, taking
advantage of the nice guys.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.701
Excuse me?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.937
Come on, you makin' him
watch your dog,

22:52.939 --> 22:56.407
it's a classic use
and abuse situation.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.545
I did not use and
abuse him.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.013
He offered.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.215
Yeah, because he likes you.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.417
Everybody knows David's
a cat person.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.753
No he's not, he's always been
into dogs.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.922
That shows how much you know
about him.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.557
Couple years ago,
during a thunderstorm,

23:13.559 --> 23:15.993
he fell in love with a
kitten names Whiskers.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.863
What?

23:18.865 --> 23:20.931
Yeah, it was a thunderstorm,

23:20.933 --> 23:23.834
David heard some meowing
behind the dumpster.

23:23.836 --> 23:27.037
He looked down and there was
this little cherub faced kitten

23:27.039 --> 23:28.039
lookin' up at him.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.875
Doey eyes.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.779
He picked it up
and brought it inside

23:34.781 --> 23:35.880
and nursed it back to health,

23:35.882 --> 23:36.981
cuddled it all night.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.184
Just a man and his
dumpster kitten.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.852
Sounds like a made up sap story.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.025
My car, my tunes.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.562
Love it man, rock on.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.085
Whoa, it's the Arch.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.188
Oh, wow.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.022
Huh.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.690
I always wanted to go up there.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.158
Me too.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.726
He what do you say, captain?

24:22.728 --> 24:24.161
There's no time.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.830
Oh, come on.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.498
Haven't you heard that half
the fun is getting there.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.666
That doesn't apply
to this trip,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.134
I don't even wanna be going.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.671
Well, my are you going?

24:33.673 --> 24:34.939
My dad's a great man.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.341
He always put his family first

24:37.343 --> 24:38.776
and taught us everything
we know.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.411
He deserves better
than that lunatic,

24:40.413 --> 24:41.946
some people call, my brother.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.382
How did he end
up out there?

24:45.384 --> 24:47.651
After my mom passed,
we thought some sunshine

24:47.653 --> 24:50.521
and a change of scenery
would do him some good.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.122
Come on, captain.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.958
I heard that in order to
get to the top of the Arch,

24:53.960 --> 24:56.861
you get to sit in these
hard compact balls.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.530
Traveling up an arch above the
city in hard compact balls,

24:59.532 --> 25:01.632
now that sounds like a
solid adventure to me.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.634
No.

25:03.703 --> 25:04.568
I bet they
have a cool gift shop.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.237
For the last time, no!

25:19.485 --> 25:20.985
I have to use the restroom.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.688
We have a few more
miles before we can stop.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.557
Oh, are you serious?

25:26.559 --> 25:28.192
Look, I just wanna get
there as fast as I can.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.227
We stop when we need gas and
that's it.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.300
Come on.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.701
What was that?

25:50.583 --> 25:52.216
Come on.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.584
What'd we hit?

25:53.586 --> 25:54.552
Can we...

25:54.554 --> 25:55.853
Can we still drive on it?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.156
Can we?

25:59.158 --> 26:00.658
Are you serious right now?

26:00.660 --> 26:02.960
No, no, no, you can't
drive on a flat tire.

26:04.063 --> 26:04.895
Okay.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.530
Hey, where you goin'?

26:06.532 --> 26:08.699
To pee, it's not like
we're gonna hit a gas station

26:08.701 --> 26:10.200
any time soon.

26:12.905 --> 26:13.737
So what do we do?

26:13.739 --> 26:15.439
We call someone or somethin'?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.943
No, we change the tire.

26:18.945 --> 26:19.945
Like you and me?

26:20.846 --> 26:21.846
Yes.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.015
Okay.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.893
Flash flood warning?

26:38.864 --> 26:39.914
That's weird.

26:39.915 --> 26:40.965
I can't believe your
dad never taught you

26:40.967 --> 26:42.600
how to change a tire.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.868
Yeah, you know, I guess
he never got around to it.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.405
Smile.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.407
Selfie.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.141
Alright.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.076
Where is it?

27:05.658 --> 27:10.828
- Oh my god!
- Oh!

27:10.830 --> 27:12.830
Open the doors!

27:21.440 --> 27:26.477
Oh my god, open the door!

27:30.716 --> 27:31.716
What the!

27:39.892 --> 27:42.092
Oh my god, we're soaking wet.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.360
Hey Connor,

27:43.361 --> 27:44.627
can you grab me some of
my clothes from the back?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.030
That was exciting.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.053
Nope.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.821
Not a chance, you're
sharing a bed with Sarah.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.222
I am not sharing a bed
with my sister.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.458
Yeah, no, I am not
sharing a bed with him.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.392
You two share.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.127
No, no, no.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.861
We are grown men, we're
not sharing a bed either.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.264
Agreed.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.332
Alright well,
I'm taking this one,

28:22.334 --> 28:23.534
you two figure it out.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.837
Youngest, floor.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.405
Now!

28:28.407 --> 28:29.407
Let's go.

28:38.484 --> 28:41.051
Can I at least get a pillow?

29:13.552 --> 29:16.019
Dude, I'm sorry,
this floor is disgusting.

29:38.611 --> 29:39.943
Hey.

29:39.945 --> 29:40.844
Hi, checkin' out, sir?

29:40.846 --> 29:41.912
Yes, please.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.180
Great, and how was your stay?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.548
It was fine, thank you.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.483
Just one second, here.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.720
And you're set.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.355
Is there anything else
I can do for you today?

29:51.357 --> 29:54.124
Yeah, you got any good
breakfast places around here?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.860
You mean other than our
complementary breakfast buffet?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.232
Okay.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.201
Well, if you prefer,

30:04.202 --> 30:06.169
there's a Paul's Pancakes down
the road.

30:06.172 --> 30:09.740
A couple miles South of that,
there's a Hamburger Luke's.

30:09.742 --> 30:11.475
A Weasel and Hutch.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.843
Did you say Weasel and Hutch?

30:12.845 --> 30:13.911
Yeah.

30:13.912 --> 30:14.978
That was my favorite
restaurant as a kid.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.446
Well, it's a great one at
that, sir.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.948
It's about 30 miles
down the road.

30:17.950 --> 30:18.782
Thank you.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.184
Yup, have a good day.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.852
Guys, we're
going to Weasel and Hutch.

30:21.854 --> 30:22.854
Come on.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.888
What's a Weasel
and Hutch?

30:24.890 --> 30:26.156
You'll find out.

30:30.196 --> 30:35.265
¶ I promised her that someday
I'd write her a song. ¶

30:35.801 --> 30:37.734
¶ Just as pretty as she was... ¶

30:37.736 --> 30:39.820
Oh my god, I can't believe
we're here.

30:39.821 --> 30:41.905
How have you guys not been
to a Weasel and Hutch before?

30:41.907 --> 30:43.140
What kinda childhood
did you have?

30:43.142 --> 30:45.709
This place was my favorite
restaurant growing up.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.344
It's got everything on
the menu, everything.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.447
Pot roasts, pancakes, the
sweet tea is unimaginable,

30:50.449 --> 30:52.115
it's literally amazing.

30:52.117 --> 30:55.118
This place inspired me to wanna
be a chef when I was a kid.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.653
Here, everybody leaves happy.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.556
Whoo.

30:59.992 --> 31:00.824
He's finally lost it.

31:00.826 --> 31:01.959
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.060
Welcome to Weasel and Hutch.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.027
How many people in your party?

31:04.029 --> 31:05.362
Table for three please.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.231
We've got some first time
Weasels today.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.065
Oh, great.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.700
Welcome Weasels.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.235
Cool, right this way.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.206
Right here, please.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.579
My dad used to take my brother
and I here every weekend.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.314
And we could order
whatever we wanted

31:24.316 --> 31:25.816
and we ordered everything.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.118
So much food would come
to the table so quickly.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.087
And I always thought the chef
was magical,

31:30.089 --> 31:32.990
that he had the ability to
cook so many delicious dishes,

31:32.992 --> 31:34.291
so quickly.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.627
I just hope to have a
gift like that one day.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.198
Great.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.666
If you guys wanna take
a look at your menus,

31:42.668 --> 31:44.501
your server will be
with you in just a sec.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.336
Thank you.

31:46.337 --> 31:48.170
They still have the exact
same game on every table.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.923
Have you guys ever played this?

31:49.924 --> 31:51.674
This is the best
game ever created.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.509
Looks like it.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.044
If memory serves me correctly,

31:54.046 --> 31:55.312
we divvy up the colors...

31:55.314 --> 31:56.380
Hi, my name is Daisy

31:56.382 --> 31:59.016
and I'll be taking care
of you today.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.384
Can I get you started
with something to drink.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.552
Three sweet teas and I
think we're ready to order.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.387
But I...

32:03.389 --> 32:04.421
Oh, no, no, I got this.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.123
Trust me, I got this.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.824
May we have one Hutches'
friend breakfast, extra bacon,

32:07.826 --> 32:10.494
some bow tie blueberry
pancakes, buttermilk short stack

32:10.496 --> 32:12.729
with peach topping,
extra whip cream,

32:12.731 --> 32:16.967
some fruit, cheese grits, and
a side of macaroni and cheese.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.268
And that'll be shared
for the table, please.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.303
Sounds good.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.305
Comin' right up.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.642
Um...

32:25.644 --> 32:28.712
I'm sorry, what did
you just order?

32:50.002 --> 32:51.002
That was so good.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.504
It's heaven on Earth,
man, really.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.506
Gut bomb.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.908
What's a gut bomb?

32:59.478 --> 33:02.012
You know when you eat too
much unhealthy food too fast?

33:02.848 --> 33:04.481
Nope, never heard of it.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.985
Alright, folks, can I
get you anything else?

33:07.987 --> 33:08.952
No, thank you.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.387
I think that's gonna be it.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.022
Okay, here's the check,
whenever you're ready.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.024
Thank you.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.626
I got this.

33:17.830 --> 33:18.895
Thank you.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.564
You're welcome.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.898
Welcome to the club, guys.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.334
Now you've had the Weasel
and Hutch experience.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.204
I like it.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.339
Hit the road?

33:29.341 --> 33:30.474
- Yeah.
- Sure.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.461
Where are we?

33:51.363 --> 33:52.662
Just outside of Tulsa.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.631
Tulsa, Oklahoma?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.200
Yes.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.069
Can we stop at the
golden oil drill?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.005
What?

34:02.241 --> 34:04.508
It's a 75 foot statue
of a golden oil drill

34:04.510 --> 34:06.943
from when Tulsa was the
oil capitol of America.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.079
Before Houston took over.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.181
How do you even know all that?

34:13.752 --> 34:14.752
This brochure.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.420
Where'd you get that?

34:17.422 --> 34:18.554
Got it at the Weasel and Hutch

34:18.556 --> 34:20.791
while you were going
gaga in the gift shop.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.196
Come on, let's go see it.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.799
If I get a picture next
to the golden oil drill,

34:28.801 --> 34:31.735
all my friends are
gonna be so jealy.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.335
Jealy?

34:33.338 --> 34:34.338
Jealous.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.542
Have you been awake
this whole time?

34:38.543 --> 34:39.543
Yes.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.378
Are you spying on us?

34:42.281 --> 34:43.880
No.

34:43.882 --> 34:44.748
Eavesdropping?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.983
No, I'm just resting my eyes.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.721
So, this oil driller...

34:54.393 --> 34:55.393
Fine.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.712
Really?

34:58.713 --> 35:00.463
Long enough to take
one picture, you hear me?

35:00.466 --> 35:02.833
One, just one and then
we're back on the road.

35:04.770 --> 35:09.840
¶ But this poor gambler's heart
won't go without a fight. ¶

35:12.845 --> 35:13.845
David!

35:14.980 --> 35:16.146
Catherine!

35:16.148 --> 35:16.980
Hi.

35:16.982 --> 35:17.814
Hey, how are you.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.382
I'm...

35:19.384 --> 35:20.384
I'm okay.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.554
Did you get a dog?

35:23.555 --> 35:25.522
Oh, no, that's the
Martin's dog.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.857
Oh, I thought he
looked familiar.

35:26.859 --> 35:28.842
Hey, Rox.

35:28.843 --> 35:30.826
Yeah, Sarah asked me to
watch him while she's gone.

35:30.829 --> 35:31.661
Sarah?

35:31.663 --> 35:32.829
Oh, Sarah.

35:32.830 --> 35:33.996
I didn't know she
was back in town.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.833
Yeah, she was for
a brief moment.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.503
But then she went to LA
with Steve and Connor.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.872
Steve?

35:41.874 --> 35:43.240
Yeah.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.808
You know.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.143
Steve...

35:46.145 --> 35:47.811
Steve?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.246
My ex?

35:49.248 --> 35:51.581
Yeah, I thought he
woulda told you.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.384
Interesting, he didn't mention
it to me.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.520
Oh.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.522
Yeah.

36:03.695 --> 36:04.695
Sorry.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.335
I can't believe no
one was there.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.571
That's like, the coolest
statue in America.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.240
People are just driving by it.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.410
I can think of a few statues

36:20.412 --> 36:22.179
people may deem more important.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.181
Like?

36:24.082 --> 36:25.682
Statue of Liberty.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.703
Mount Rushmore.

36:29.704 --> 36:31.321
Rocky, top of the step,
Philadelphia, Stallone.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.089
Look, I already got 65 likes.

36:34.660 --> 36:35.492
That make you happy?

36:35.494 --> 36:36.893
Yes, it does.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.199
Oh, shit, I gotta...

36:42.201 --> 36:43.667
I gotta take this, be quiet.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.638
Hello?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.140
Steve.

36:50.142 --> 36:51.675
Hello, Catherine.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.437
Where are you?

36:53.979 --> 36:56.580
I'm out driving right now,
going to pick up some food.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.814
Drop the bullshit.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.983
I just saw Dave and he told
me what you were doing.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.652
Of course he did.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.320
You're drive to Los Angeles?

37:03.322 --> 37:05.488
Are you insane?

37:05.490 --> 37:08.692
What is this, your second
round of your midlife crisis?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.662
God, what am I gonna
tell the kids?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.864
What do you mean,
tell the kids?

37:14.866 --> 37:16.010
Sorry,

37:16.011 --> 37:17.155
Daddy can't take
you this weekend.

37:17.156 --> 37:18.300
Because he's out gallivanting
across the country...

37:18.303 --> 37:19.803
I didn't tell you

37:19.804 --> 37:21.304
because I knew this is the
exact reaction I would get.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.806
I'll see you Saturday!

37:28.380 --> 37:29.879
Are you okay?

38:15.861 --> 38:17.027
Where are we?

38:18.430 --> 38:20.697
New Mexico, couple
miles from Albuquerque.

38:25.904 --> 38:26.904
Aren't you tired?

38:27.839 --> 38:29.572
Shouldn't we pull over?

38:31.009 --> 38:34.044
We will, few more
miles before we can stop.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.854
You know, I think
it's really great

38:44.856 --> 38:46.890
how much passion you have for
you kids.

38:48.894 --> 38:52.896
I don't mean to pry on
your situation or anything.

38:52.898 --> 38:55.832
It's just, most guys I know

38:55.834 --> 38:57.400
only think about themselves.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.738
It's always refreshing to see.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.007
Well my kids
are my everything.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.694
I don't know how to be
away from them,

39:07.695 --> 39:09.712
I guess I'm still learning how
to adjust.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.949
I can only imagine.

39:15.087 --> 39:17.821
I hope you have to never
find out what this feels like.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.223
Yeah, me neither.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.294
But it's an admirable trait,

39:26.398 --> 39:27.398
captain.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.406
Okay, I'm gonna go
back to sleep.

39:36.408 --> 39:39.642
Promise you'll pull over
before you run us off the road.

39:42.247 --> 39:43.780
I promise.

39:58.330 --> 39:59.162
Are we all checked out?

39:59.164 --> 40:00.563
Yup!

40:00.565 --> 40:02.399
You're in a great mood.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.800
I feel refreshed.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.069
Everybody in the car, LA,
here we come.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.025
Well, it looks like
we're here.

41:04.996 --> 41:05.996
Hey, you okay?

41:08.066 --> 41:09.066
No.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.035
Yes, it just...

41:13.672 --> 41:15.672
I can't believe we're
actually here.

41:15.674 --> 41:16.674
Believe it.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.775
And you'll do great, buddy.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.712
I'm shaking.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.447
I'm actually shaking.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.649
Is that normal or am I
having a stroke here?

41:27.586 --> 41:28.485
I think you're just nervous.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.320
Yeah, you're probably right.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.589
Or it could be low blood sugar,

41:32.591 --> 41:34.951
I heard that shaking happens
to people with low blood sugar.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.261
Got any candy on ya?

41:38.263 --> 41:39.762
No, I'm fresh out of candy.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.699
Well, maybe we should
go to the store, you know?

41:42.701 --> 41:43.533
Just to be safe.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.435
Connor, you're gonna
crush this.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.506
Come on, Connor, let's
go show 'em what you got.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.774
We didn't drive all
this way to go back now.

41:53.478 --> 41:56.079
You're right, you're right.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.014
Okay.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.616
Alright, let's go show 'em
what we got.

42:07.726 --> 42:08.992
Knock 'em dead, buddy.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.127
You're not comin'?

42:11.129 --> 42:11.961
I can't.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.763
I have to do what I came to do.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.299
I need you in there, man.

42:16.301 --> 42:17.301
You don't need me.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.669
You're gonna nail this, Connor.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.772
Getting there is half the
battle and look where you're at.

42:22.774 --> 42:23.774
You're here.

42:24.509 --> 42:25.708
Just trust in yourself.

42:26.511 --> 42:27.677
Captain to co captain.

42:30.549 --> 42:31.549
Co captain.

42:32.517 --> 42:33.517
You got this.

42:34.553 --> 42:35.652
Thanks, captain.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.591
I'll see you guys
back at the hotel.

42:41.593 --> 42:42.425
Alright.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.427
Good luck!

42:45.997 --> 42:47.430
- You checked in?
- Yes.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.264
Checked in?

42:48.266 --> 42:49.098
You're checked in?

42:49.100 --> 42:49.933
Cool.

42:49.935 --> 42:50.767
You guys here for the auditions?

42:50.769 --> 42:51.968
No, I'm here to rob a bank,

42:51.970 --> 42:53.170
what, that piano give me away?

42:55.574 --> 42:56.472
I am so sorry.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.509
I have rude, not funny
verbal spillage

42:59.511 --> 43:00.376
going on.
- Connor, stop talking.

43:00.378 --> 43:01.778
Yes.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.179
Yes, we are here
for the audition.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.681
Great.

43:04.682 --> 43:06.182
Take this waver, fill it out to
check in.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.352
Then wait behind these
folks to be called, alright?

43:09.354 --> 43:10.219
Thank you.

43:10.221 --> 43:11.287
Thank you.

43:12.524 --> 43:13.423
Okay.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.425
Let's go.

43:31.242 --> 43:36.312
¶ Oh, this retched old soul ¶

43:36.681 --> 43:38.247
¶ I'm too young and naive ¶

43:38.249 --> 43:43.152
¶ to be feelin' this worn down
and old. ¶

43:43.154 --> 43:47.256
¶ I think about her. ¶

43:47.258 --> 43:48.524
¶ When the... ¶

43:56.034 --> 43:57.200
Hey.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.268
No, no, I don't see ya.

44:01.806 --> 44:02.639
Oh, there you are.

44:02.641 --> 44:04.273
Hey.

44:04.275 --> 44:05.275
How are ya, man?

44:06.911 --> 44:08.911
Good to see you,
how was the drive?

44:08.913 --> 44:09.746
Ah, it wasn't bad.

44:09.748 --> 44:10.880
Good, good.

44:10.882 --> 44:11.848
Gosh, these houses,
people live like this?

44:11.850 --> 44:13.049
Yeah, I know,
can you believe it?

44:13.051 --> 44:14.784
We're actually prepping this one

44:14.786 --> 44:15.618
for an open hose this weekend.

44:15.619 --> 44:16.451
You wanna guess what's it's
goin' for?

44:16.454 --> 44:17.620
No idea.

44:17.622 --> 44:18.454
$4.5 million.

44:18.456 --> 44:19.355
Jesus.

44:19.357 --> 44:20.507
I know.

44:20.508 --> 44:21.658
It's owned by some drummer in
some band,

44:21.660 --> 44:23.626
the Cross Scheme Tremors?

44:23.628 --> 44:24.761
Travers, Cross Cave Travers.

44:24.763 --> 44:26.062
Yeah, that's the one.

44:26.064 --> 44:27.664
No kidding, that's a big band.

44:27.666 --> 44:28.965
Hm, never heard of them.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.033
Check out this view.

44:33.705 --> 44:34.705
Wow.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.008
Doesn't get any
better than this.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.043
Wow.

44:40.045 --> 44:41.210
Well, no, no, no,
I take that back.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.446
Technically it does get better,
two weeks after closing.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.081
Two words, bro.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.883
Commission check.

44:46.885 --> 44:49.218
There's literally
nothing better than that.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.753
Doin' good, Brad.

44:50.755 --> 44:52.255
Livin' the dream.

44:52.257 --> 44:53.690
Not too late for you to hop on,

44:53.692 --> 44:56.192
now that the old ball
and chain's been cut.

44:56.194 --> 44:58.154
I mean, not that I'm saying
Catherine's, you know,

44:58.897 --> 44:59.729
old or whatever.

44:59.731 --> 45:00.753
I just...

45:00.754 --> 45:01.776
I don't know, sometimes
I get a little sad

45:01.777 --> 45:02.799
whenever I think
about your life.

45:02.801 --> 45:03.933
Sad?

45:03.935 --> 45:05.601
Well, you married your
high school sweetheart,

45:05.603 --> 45:07.003
you had two kids before
you were 30.

45:07.005 --> 45:09.605
You never got to explore what's
out there.

45:09.607 --> 45:12.608
But now, you can.

45:14.245 --> 45:15.278
Welcome to freedom.

45:19.884 --> 45:21.551
Is that what this feeling is?

45:21.553 --> 45:22.485
Freedom?

45:22.487 --> 45:25.154
Yeah, and you should
embrace it.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.756
I mean, why live the life of a
one girl,

45:26.758 --> 45:29.592
old school country man, when
you can live like a king?

45:31.029 --> 45:33.796
I'm talkin' models, everywhere.

45:33.798 --> 45:37.400
And they let you do
whatever you want.

45:38.236 --> 45:39.068
Eh, okay.

45:39.070 --> 45:39.902
Where's Dad?

45:39.904 --> 45:40.737
He's in the car.

45:40.739 --> 45:41.804
What, here?

45:41.806 --> 45:43.072
Yeah.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.907
What are you doing?

45:46.811 --> 45:48.144
Dad.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.179
Calm down,
I cracked the windows.

45:53.451 --> 45:54.984
Dad!

45:54.986 --> 45:56.586
Dad!

45:58.156 --> 45:59.388
Ugh, thank you.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.290
Open the car, jack ass.

46:01.292 --> 46:02.658
Relax, he's fine.

46:04.796 --> 46:05.728
Dad?

46:07.298 --> 46:08.131
What is he even doing here?

46:08.133 --> 46:09.932
What happened to
his house nurse?

46:09.934 --> 46:10.767
Oh, she quit this morning.

46:10.769 --> 46:11.868
She quit?

46:11.870 --> 46:13.336
It's hard to find good help
these days.

46:13.338 --> 46:15.088
What are you talking about,
man,

46:15.089 --> 46:16.839
she looked after him for almost
two years.

46:16.841 --> 46:17.673
What did you do?

46:17.675 --> 46:18.508
Nothin'.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.109
Bradford, what did you do?

46:20.111 --> 46:21.744
Okay.

46:21.746 --> 46:23.212
I may have slept
with her daughter.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.215
Disgusting, you know that.

46:26.217 --> 46:27.483
Well, you know, she always
liked me.

46:27.485 --> 46:29.285
I didn't think she'd mind.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.254
I can't even look at you right
now, man.

46:31.256 --> 46:33.489
Just livin' the dream, man.

46:33.491 --> 46:34.590
Is that what this is?

46:34.592 --> 46:36.893
The dream is living like
the biggest prick in life?

46:36.895 --> 46:39.729
A money hungry, womanizing,
dirt bag,

46:39.731 --> 46:41.497
who can't treat his father,
the man that raised us,

46:41.499 --> 46:43.232
with just a little bit
of human decency?

46:43.234 --> 46:44.700
Is that the dream that
you're talkin' about?

46:44.702 --> 46:46.335
Okay, I think you
need to calm down.

46:46.337 --> 46:47.403
No, I'm not gonna calm down.

46:47.405 --> 46:48.905
You lived your entire life

46:48.907 --> 46:50.406
like the world revolves
around it.

46:50.408 --> 46:52.675
And it was slightly cute
when you were a kid,

46:52.677 --> 46:54.544
but you're an adult now,
it's pitiful.

46:54.546 --> 46:56.712
You need to start
acting like one.

46:56.714 --> 46:57.613
Water.

46:57.615 --> 46:59.649
Yeah, I'm sorry Dad, we'll
get you one in a second.

46:59.651 --> 47:01.517
Feel better, getting
all that out?

47:02.287 --> 47:04.821
You're such a son of a bitch,
Steve.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.255
You think you always know best.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.423
It's your way or the highway.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.991
Well, guess what?

47:08.993 --> 47:09.826
I picked the highway,
and look at us.

47:09.828 --> 47:11.961
No, no, no, look at me.

47:11.963 --> 47:14.764
Rich, fit, good looking.

47:14.766 --> 47:16.432
And look at yourself,

47:16.434 --> 47:19.602
jobless, bearded, and divorced.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.504
I gotta say,
I think I'm winning.

47:24.809 --> 47:25.741
Dad, whoa.

47:25.743 --> 47:27.076
Dad, are you okay?

47:27.078 --> 47:28.078
Dad?

47:42.093 --> 47:43.025
Is he okay?

47:43.027 --> 47:44.660
Yes, he's fine.

47:44.662 --> 47:46.729
Just a little bit dehydrated.

47:46.731 --> 47:49.632
You're very lucky that he
wasn't hurt during the fall.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.434
You have to be more careful.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.837
I will, thank you.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.606
It says here that
he was diagnosed

47:56.608 --> 47:58.341
with early stages of dementia,

47:58.343 --> 48:00.042
a couple months ago.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.410
Is there a problem?

48:01.412 --> 48:04.313
No, it's just that talking
with him,

48:04.315 --> 48:07.516
he seemed to really
be not there.

48:08.920 --> 48:11.320
Dementia affects people
at different rates.

48:12.123 --> 48:13.689
But it was just so quick.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.993
Yeah, none of us really
saw it coming.

48:18.196 --> 48:20.363
You can go in and see him if
you'd like.

48:21.633 --> 48:22.633
Okay.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.391
Hey, Sarah.

48:48.393 --> 48:49.393
Yeah?

48:51.329 --> 48:54.797
Thank you for coming to LA
with me.

48:54.799 --> 48:56.065
If I were here by myself,

48:56.067 --> 48:58.534
I probably woulda
skipped out by now, so...

49:01.673 --> 49:05.608
I know we bicker sometimes

49:08.046 --> 49:10.446
but I'm really glad you
suggested I come along.

49:13.751 --> 49:14.751
I hate to admit it,

49:15.520 --> 49:16.686
but you were right.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.056
This has been an
amazing adventure

49:20.058 --> 49:23.492
and I definitely needed it.

49:23.494 --> 49:25.027
20-84.

49:25.029 --> 49:26.762
20-84?

49:26.764 --> 49:28.331
Come on in.

49:28.333 --> 49:29.398
Go get 'em.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.406
Come on in.

49:50.855 --> 49:53.055
Don't worry,
I won't press charges.

49:53.057 --> 49:54.757
Now who's the
good looking one?

49:55.960 --> 49:58.594
Where's you learn
to throw a punch like that?

49:58.596 --> 50:00.029
The Steve I know couldn't
throw a punch to save his life,

50:00.031 --> 50:01.063
now would he.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.367
I honestly don't know.

50:04.369 --> 50:05.489
I think I just hit my limit.

50:06.704 --> 50:09.672
I never really expected my
life to turn out like this.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.474
It just wasn't part of my plan.

50:11.476 --> 50:12.641
It's understandable.

50:14.779 --> 50:15.779
Wanna go in?

50:19.317 --> 50:20.783
No, no, I can't.

50:20.785 --> 50:22.618
I'm actually late for a date.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.787
Do you mind saying
goodbye for me?

50:24.789 --> 50:25.789
Seriously?

50:27.625 --> 50:28.491
Can't keep the ladies waiting,
bro.

50:28.493 --> 50:29.525
Thanks.

50:42.940 --> 50:44.140
20-85.

50:47.879 --> 50:49.211
I can't believe I
didn't get it.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.282
At least you put
yourself out there.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.450
I guess, but I failed.

50:54.452 --> 50:56.018
No, you didn't.

50:56.020 --> 50:59.855
This is a stupid TV show more
that it is a talent show.

50:59.857 --> 51:01.957
They're looking for specifics
that appeal

51:02.960 --> 51:04.660
to their target audience
to raise their ratings.

51:04.662 --> 51:07.196
Like, aesthetically
pleasing people.

51:08.099 --> 51:09.999
That doesn't
make me feel better.

51:10.001 --> 51:12.535
Okay, that's not what I'm
trying to say.

51:13.671 --> 51:16.005
I just mean,
this is one rejection.

51:16.007 --> 51:18.841
There can be many more
for whatever reason.

51:18.843 --> 51:20.843
Kudos for putting
yourself out there.

51:24.615 --> 51:25.214
Thank you.

51:25.215 --> 51:25.814
That alone, puts you
above millions of others.

51:25.817 --> 51:26.817
Thanks.

51:27.952 --> 51:28.952
20-87.

51:31.022 --> 51:32.488
Hey.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.657
Dude, I heard you
playin' through the door,

51:34.659 --> 51:36.659
you're like amazing, you're
really good.

51:36.661 --> 51:37.960
Thanks, man.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.995
Here, take my card.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.898
I'm Cody, I'm a guitar player,

51:42.900 --> 51:44.133
originally from Minnesota.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.634
I don't know what your next move
is, man,

51:45.636 --> 51:48.404
but I really like the
way you play the keys.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.805
Thanks man.

51:49.807 --> 51:50.639
Yeah.

51:50.641 --> 51:51.641
I'm Connor.

51:52.310 --> 51:53.776
That's my sister, Sarah.

51:53.778 --> 51:54.610
Cool.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.744
What are you guys doing later?

51:55.746 --> 51:58.347
We're having a little get
together at our place,

51:58.349 --> 51:59.815
maybe you wanna stop by?

52:00.585 --> 52:03.786
Food, booze, nothin'
too extreme, you know.

52:03.788 --> 52:04.687
Yeah, man, maybe.

52:04.689 --> 52:06.956
My number's on the card,
just text me for details,

52:06.958 --> 52:08.257
networking.

52:08.259 --> 52:10.593
I'm told that's how
this city works.

52:10.595 --> 52:11.427
Yeah, man.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.261
Alright.

52:12.263 --> 52:13.095
Cool.

52:13.097 --> 52:13.929
Cool, see you tonight?

52:13.931 --> 52:14.964
- Yeah, for sure.
- Alright.

52:14.966 --> 52:16.098
Later, Sarah.

52:17.468 --> 52:18.667
Can you believe it?

52:33.384 --> 52:34.384
Hey.

52:36.988 --> 52:38.621
What are you doing here?

52:38.623 --> 52:40.489
Did your date throw
herself down the stairs

52:40.491 --> 52:42.591
at the sight of you?

52:42.593 --> 52:44.727
I just came back to see
how he was.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.563
And I guess I felt a
little bad about leaving.

52:48.966 --> 52:49.966
He's fine.

52:50.902 --> 52:52.468
And I wanted to talk to you.

52:53.771 --> 52:54.771
Then talk.

52:57.975 --> 52:59.391
I just wanted to say,
thank you,

52:59.392 --> 53:01.072
for picking him up and
taking him with you.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.347
It's what any normal son would
do.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.349
Or should do.

53:07.618 --> 53:08.618
I know.

53:10.955 --> 53:12.087
You've always been the one to
step up

53:12.089 --> 53:14.190
whenever responsibilities
struck.

53:14.192 --> 53:15.991
And we know sometimes
I am not.

53:21.165 --> 53:22.165
Look...

53:25.036 --> 53:25.968
The way I see it,

53:25.970 --> 53:28.571
you've got two beautiful kids
you've managed to keep alive,

53:28.573 --> 53:29.838
for what, three years now?

53:29.840 --> 53:31.373
Six and nine.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.375
No.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.276
Wow.

53:34.278 --> 53:36.011
It's been that long.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.446
Jeez.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.548
Well, tell 'em Uncle Brad said,
what's up?

53:40.351 --> 53:42.651
But in all honesty, I can't
even keep a fish alive

53:42.653 --> 53:44.019
for more than a few days.

53:44.021 --> 53:44.887
It's true.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.256
I had a pet fish, no name.

53:47.258 --> 53:48.557
I got him because I heard women
like it

53:48.559 --> 53:50.426
whenever you have a pet.

53:50.427 --> 53:52.294
Shows a compassionate side
or somethin' like that.

53:52.296 --> 53:55.698
Anyway, I kept forgetting
that he was in the corner.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.366
It's not like they
make any noise

53:58.202 --> 53:59.702
or give you any reason to
remember them.

53:59.704 --> 54:02.404
Therefore, his presence
is easily forgotten.

54:05.343 --> 54:07.376
Dad's kinda become the fish.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.611
What?

54:08.613 --> 54:10.012
He doesn't say much

54:10.013 --> 54:11.893
and whenever he does, it
doesn't make any sense.

54:12.183 --> 54:13.616
Let me get this straight.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.318
You just compared our father to
a fish

54:16.320 --> 54:19.221
that sits in solitude and
swims around in its own crap?

54:20.258 --> 54:21.538
Well, look at him, am I wrong?

54:22.326 --> 54:23.692
You are seriously disturbed.

54:23.694 --> 54:24.793
Ah, but not wrong.

54:28.065 --> 54:29.048
Bradford.

54:29.049 --> 54:30.529
I don't know what went wrong
with you,

54:31.202 --> 54:32.301
but I have to tell you this now

54:32.302 --> 54:33.401
because I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

54:33.404 --> 54:34.370
Frankly, I don't care.

54:34.372 --> 54:36.705
But you don't deserve a father
like ours.

54:38.142 --> 54:39.241
Hey...

54:39.243 --> 54:40.276
He's the best man
I've ever known

54:40.278 --> 54:42.378
and he loved being a dad to us.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.581
He didn't raise you to
become this selfish,

54:46.450 --> 54:49.485
narcissistic, disgrace
that you turned out to be.

54:51.188 --> 54:52.721
Steve.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.323
I don't know what's
happenin' for you right now.

54:54.325 --> 54:56.292
Just go, man,
I got it from here.

54:58.362 --> 54:59.362
Okay.

55:01.332 --> 55:02.332
Bye Pop.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.034
Bye Steve.

55:05.036 --> 55:06.036
Bye.

55:08.072 --> 55:08.904
You should go out tonight.

55:08.906 --> 55:10.172
Take in the city.

55:10.174 --> 55:12.341
Have yourself an adventure,

55:12.343 --> 55:15.377
Dad will still be here in
the morning, I promise.

55:19.784 --> 55:22.351
Oh yeah, hey babe, I'm
sorry to keep you waiting.

55:22.353 --> 55:25.421
Yeah, I got stuck in traffic.

55:46.577 --> 55:47.409
Hey.

55:47.411 --> 55:48.243
Hey, good to see you.

55:48.245 --> 55:49.345
Let's get you a drink.

55:49.347 --> 55:50.347
I'm okay.

55:52.216 --> 55:53.349
I was gonna stay
and I don't know.

55:53.351 --> 55:54.283
it's just...

55:54.285 --> 55:55.451
Really isn't my style anymore.

55:55.453 --> 55:57.019
Oh, come on, one drink.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.154
You don't wanna have a little
bit of fun?

56:00.324 --> 56:01.857
You forget I grew up
in the Boondocks.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.325
This, with beer pong and booze

56:03.327 --> 56:04.893
was every summer night for me.

56:05.963 --> 56:09.365
Okay, I'll accept that.

56:09.367 --> 56:10.399
Come on, you have
to at least stay

56:10.401 --> 56:11.500
for on of Connor's songs.

56:11.502 --> 56:12.502
Yeah.

56:14.772 --> 56:17.206
They've been practicing
ever since auditions.

56:18.409 --> 56:19.969
I think Connor found himself a
new band.

56:21.178 --> 56:22.010
Wow, that's move's quickly.

56:22.012 --> 56:24.012
Yup.

56:24.013 --> 56:26.013
Thank you for coming to
our house party tonight.

56:26.016 --> 56:28.317
Today, we auditioned
for the show,

56:28.319 --> 56:30.352
Million Dollar Entertainer.

56:30.354 --> 56:32.955
Maybe some of you guys have
heard of it.

56:32.957 --> 56:35.858
Who knew my brother would
be so good at networking?

56:35.860 --> 56:37.025
Sometimes people surprise you.

56:37.027 --> 56:38.160
Well,

56:38.162 --> 56:40.462
we didn't make it,
unfortunately.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.066
However, as a firm believer

56:44.068 --> 56:47.102
that everything happens
for a reason,

56:47.104 --> 56:50.572
we met the most amazing
keyboard player.

56:50.574 --> 56:55.644
So please welcome,
to our jam session,

56:56.814 --> 56:59.314
all the way from Wisconsin,

57:00.451 --> 57:01.451
Connor Martin!

57:37.288 --> 57:38.320
It's Dad, it's Dad.

57:38.322 --> 57:39.254
Hey, sweetheart.

57:39.256 --> 57:40.589
Hi, Daddy.

57:40.591 --> 57:41.757
Hi Dad.

57:41.759 --> 57:42.791
What's up, buddy?

57:42.793 --> 57:44.209
How's soccer going?

57:44.210 --> 57:45.626
I heard you
made the championship.

57:45.629 --> 57:46.662
Yes.

57:46.664 --> 57:48.697
Oh, man, I'm so proud of you.

57:48.699 --> 57:50.833
Dad, are you going
to be there.

57:50.835 --> 57:51.633
Oh yeah.

57:51.635 --> 57:52.501
I'll be there.

57:52.503 --> 57:54.436
I'll pick you up on Saturday.

57:54.438 --> 57:57.339
Hey, can I talk to your
mom for a second, please?

57:58.509 --> 57:59.341
Hold on.

57:59.343 --> 58:00.343
Love you, bud.

58:01.579 --> 58:02.744
No, Logan, I don't need to
talk to him.

58:02.746 --> 58:05.547
Oh, no, no, Logan, your mom,
not Grandma.

58:05.549 --> 58:06.549
Logan, please, no.

58:07.618 --> 58:08.951
Steve...

58:09.753 --> 58:10.753
Miriam.

58:12.857 --> 58:14.990
So, where's Catherine?

58:14.992 --> 58:17.292
She's out, dinner
with a friend.

58:19.263 --> 58:20.362
So I get the kiddos
for the evening.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.530
I hope they're behaving.

58:21.532 --> 58:23.765
Of course, they're good kids.

58:23.767 --> 58:25.200
Please tell Catherine
I called.

58:25.202 --> 58:26.202
I will.

58:28.506 --> 58:30.546
Could I talk to the kids
one more time real quick?

58:30.641 --> 58:32.241
Aw, look how late it is.

58:32.243 --> 58:34.843
Grandma's lettin' you
stay up past your bedtime.

58:34.845 --> 58:36.612
You better not get used to it.

58:36.614 --> 58:38.046
You be good for her, okay?

58:38.048 --> 58:39.781
I'll see you soon.

58:39.783 --> 58:41.049
Bye Daddy, love you.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.851
Bye, I love you.

58:42.853 --> 58:43.853
Bye...

59:30.067 --> 59:30.899
Hi.

59:30.901 --> 59:31.767
Hey.

59:31.769 --> 59:33.669
Why aren't you sleeping?

59:33.671 --> 59:34.703
I couldn't sleep.

59:36.106 --> 59:37.005
Are you okay?

59:37.007 --> 59:39.374
Yeah, I was just
wondering if I could come in

59:39.376 --> 59:40.376
and chat for a bit?

59:41.645 --> 59:43.679
Oh.

59:43.681 --> 59:44.813
Okay.

59:47.084 --> 59:48.084
Connor's sleeping.

59:49.720 --> 59:50.852
Right.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.955
We all have a
really early morning.

59:54.058 --> 59:54.923
We do.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.893
Should you be resting up?

59:57.895 --> 59:59.428
Right.

59:59.430 --> 01:00:00.462
Good night then.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:04.634
Wait.

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:11.073
I guess we could chat for a
little bit.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.708
Just not in here.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.811
Oh, that'd be great.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.079
Okay.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.113
Let me get my sweatshirt.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:28.457
Business administration and
management.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:29.459
Yup.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.395
I just can't see
you doin' that.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.665
Why is that?

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.900
I don't know, I picture
you as a librarian

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:41.069
or a kindergarten teacher or
something.

01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:42.638
Me?

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.707
What made you choose
that major?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.810
A boy.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:52.114
Wow, I did not see
that coming.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:57.836
And my parents.

01:00:57.837 --> 01:00:58.786
I didn't know what I wanted
to study at the time,

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.389
and you gotta choose something.

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:04.559
So that seemed like the
satisfactory fit.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.896
I see.

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:10.832
You know, I took a
creative writing class once.

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:15.037
I wrote a lotta pieces,

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.738
but I never showed
it to anybody.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:18.908
Just my teachers.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.677
Why not?

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.645
Oof, I don't know.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:26.081
Guess it's personal reflection.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:30.585
I really loved it though.

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.088
Almost changed my major.

01:01:34.258 --> 01:01:35.457
What was the holdback?

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:38.193
There's no money in the arts.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:41.496
And I'm the successful child.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:44.332
The one that gets
the good grades

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.034
and goes to the good school,

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:49.438
gets the steady job.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:54.209
'Cause I'm probably going
to be taking care of Connor.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.779
Because let's face it, he's
not gonna grow up anytime soon.

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.216
I don't feel like it's
fair for you parents

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.538
to put that kinda
pressure on you.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.421
That's what's funny.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:07.423
They didn't.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.793
I put that expectation
on myself.

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:13.195
Why would you do that?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.231
I don't know.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.302
It's really funny to say this
out loud.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.757
Um...

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:27.238
It's just safer to color
in the lines.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:32.647
And I was already too
invested in business,

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:36.151
that it would have been a
complete waste of time and money.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.552
Well, I can speak
from experience

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.221
that that's where you're wrong.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.090
It's never too late
to start over.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.459
Look at me, I'm a perfect
example for that one.

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:46.628
Whatever career I get when I go
back home,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.231
I have no choice but for it to
be new.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.267
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.435
I have no idea.

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:58.440
I spent so many
years in routine,

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:01.143
I think I forgot what I loved.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:05.981
Well, you have a long
car ride home.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.318
Maybe the road will
help you remember.

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:13.655
We do have a long trip back,
don't we?

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:16.325
Oh...

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.795
I'm not going back.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:21.897
I figured Connor would stay,

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.465
but why aren't you going back?

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.835
I have nothing to go back to.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.871
Of course you do.

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.772
This could be the start
to a great new friendship.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:32.607
Yeah?

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:33.475
Yeah.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:35.644
And David, he'd love to see you,

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.179
spend some time with
you and stuff.

01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:39.581
Yeah, I guess.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:45.320
I'm just gonna make sure
that Connor is okay first.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:46.555
You're a good sister.

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:50.192
You're wise beyond your
years, you know that?

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.626
I think you should
start writing again.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.762
yeah?

01:03:53.764 --> 01:03:55.096
Yeah.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:59.234
Perhaps you're right.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.501
We learn about ourselves
through the stories of others.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.404
The ones that are
courageous enough

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:04.139
to share their
experiences with us.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.675
Everything, from their
flaws and failures.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:10.078
To their success
and purpose in life.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.348
Interesting.

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.577
Who knows, maybe one day
I'll be telling a story

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.786
about a unwanted
cross-country adventure I took

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:19.254
with a girl and her brother.

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:24.159
And how it may have been
the most life changing,

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.094
eye opening adventure
of my life.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:30.098
Now, that's a good story.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.434
And the best thing about it,

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:33.436
is that it's true.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.338
Yeah, the best ones
usually are.

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:47.716
I think we've had a
little too much wine.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:49.718
I think you're right.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.786
Come on, I'll walk you
to your room.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.310
Another beautiful day
in the city.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.313
You smell that, brotha?

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.317
That is the smell of endless
opportunity headed my way.

01:05:26.657 --> 01:05:27.657
Where's Sarah?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.593
I'm gonna get a soda,
you want anything?

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.827
No, I'm good, thanks.

01:05:38.835 --> 01:05:41.002
Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:42.837
Hi.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:45.941
You okay?

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.742
Yeah, are you okay?

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:48.977
Yeah, it's just...

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.780
After last night I just wanna
make sure

01:05:51.782 --> 01:05:53.648
it wasn't weird between us.

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.483
Steve, I enjoyed it.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.519
It was nice to have a real
conversation.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:05:59.955
I'm cool if you're cool.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:00.957
I'm cool.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.458
Gonna hug it out?

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.592
Yup.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.128
Check it out,
it's Mountain Fresh.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.565
I haven't seen this
stuff since 2004.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:11.633
What are you guys doin'?

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:12.901
Get in here, buddy.

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:14.035
We're having a little group hug.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.005
Ah.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:20.409
What a journey.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.477
Okay, my friends.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.447
It's time for me to get going.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.650
I'm sad to see you go,
captain.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.151
Thank you for the ride.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.153
My pleasure.

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.121
Good kid, Connor.

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:35.090
Proud of you for
pursuing your dreams.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:36.891
That means a lot.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:39.060
It's not too late for
you to go with us.

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:40.996
I know, and I appreciate it.

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:43.398
But I'm gonna help Connor
get an apartment

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.967
and point him in the right
direction of a grocery store.

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:46.868
I get it.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.571
The two of you will be
great at whatever you do.

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:51.806
Thank you.

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:52.674
Welcome.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:53.742
Hey, do you think
David would mind

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:55.744
watching Rox for a
little bit longer?

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.512
Ah, I'm sure he'll be fine
with it.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:06:59.681
See ya later, kid.

01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:12.627
You all good, Pop?

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:35.885
You comfy, Dad?

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.624
Excited to get back
to your roots?

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.826
Taylor and Logan are
gonna be happy to see you.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.300
Dad?

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:55.737
Can you even understand me?

01:07:58.141 --> 01:07:59.307
Is this how we all end up?

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.011
Is this what the end is like?

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:06.849
Is this it?

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.388
I quit my job, I got divorced by
my wife,

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:15.490
I lost my kids.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.661
I keep thinkin' it can't
get any worse than this,

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.095
but if this is the end...

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.300
Shit.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.506
I'm nervous to go home, Dad.

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:32.508
It's different.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:36.377
Catherine and I split up,

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:40.215
and I guess for us, it was
over a long time ago but...

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.785
But my kids.

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:48.490
I don't know how to lose them.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.559
I'm not losing the per se,
I just...

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.162
I feel like I'm getting demoted.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.706
You and Ma, you loved each other
for life.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.979
You'd go in the office,
and you'd work hard

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.013
and then you'd come home
and you'd work harder

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:13.747
to be a husband and a father.

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:17.785
For years I couldn't
figure out how you did it.

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:20.555
I think I know now.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260
You loved it.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.863
The job, the family.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.501
You made us your world because
it brought you happiness.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.006
That's what I can't figure out,
Dad,

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:41.676
I don't know what brings
me happiness anymore.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:42.977
I know it's being a father,

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.013
but now that I'm a part time
dad, I...

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:55.190
It just hurts, Dad, I don't...

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:56.457
I don't know what to do.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:02.130
You'll figure it out, son.

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:04.266
What?

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:06.734
Did you...

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:08.636
Did you just respond to me?

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:09.638
Yeah, I did.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540
And I heard you.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:17.512
I am so confused right
now, I thought you had...

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:18.846
Dementia, yeah, I know.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:21.584
I made it up.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.085
I made it up.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:26.037
I made it up.

01:10:26.038 --> 01:10:27.154
It was the only way I
could get you to rescue me

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:28.756
from your brother's care.

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:31.793
Why didn't you just call me?

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:32.861
I...

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:33.928
I would have come
and picked you up.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:34.762
I know you would have, Steve,

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:36.831
you're always a good kid.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.899
But I wasn't gonna take that
risk, nope.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:41.502
So you faked dementia?

01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.504
Yeah.

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:44.939
You're sick, Dad.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.841
I mean, I'm happy that
you're okay right now,

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:48.676
but you're sick.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.361
Ah, maybe a little

01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:52.045
but I'm really happy with
this situation, you and I.

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.281
I mean, this is great.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.949
Oh, well that's comforting.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:58.553
I'll ignore your sarcasm,
sonny boy.

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.989
But let me answer some
of your questions, here.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:06.261
You and Catherine, I always
liked her, sorry to see her go,

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.164
but people grow apart,
they grow together.

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:11.733
That's the way it is.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.269
It's not a bad thing,
it's just the way life is.

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:17.572
But you and Mom
never grew apart.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:18.790
That's different.

01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:20.351
She was one of a kind, she was
an angel.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.745
And this part time dad thing...

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.380
You're a full time dad.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:27.782
Not when the
court is involved.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:29.417
No, you listen to me, son.

01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:32.820
You have to take
advantage of every minute.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:35.890
So you have a limited
time to be with them?

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.226
So you make sure
you're fully there,

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:39.661
every second you're with 'em.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.763
You play with them,
you talk to them,

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.131
you teach them life lessons,

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:45.400
you make memories that
will last a lifetime.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:47.235
That's how you become a full
time dad

01:11:47.237 --> 01:11:49.337
and a part time situation.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:50.772
That sorta makes sense.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:51.839
Of course it does.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:56.911
This job thing, I mean,
don't sweat it.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.179
You should use this time

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:01.549
to figure out what you really
want to do.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.384
I mean, time off, it's a gift.

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:04.585
Do not waste it.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.855
Thank you, Dad.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.557
Don't thank me,
it's the truth.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:14.195
But you could do your old dad
one favor.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:17.499
Name it.

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:20.201
Remember those recipes you and
your mom

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:21.602
used to prepare for dinner?

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:27.008
Yeah, I haven't made any
of those since college.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.210
Yeah, and I haven't had
'em since she passed away.

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:34.282
I need you to make me a
real corned beef sandwich,

01:12:35.085 --> 01:12:37.752
the whole shebang with
horseradish and everything.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:41.589
Let me tell you, that low-carb
pudding at the hospital

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:43.057
did not suffice.

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:02.610
Daddy!

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.644
Hey, princess.

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:04.646
Muah, muah.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:06.748
You know, a friend
arrived for you?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:07.682
For me?

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:09.751
Yeah, what was his name?

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:11.285
Hold on, it's gonna come to me.

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:14.722
Uh, oh yeah, it's the tickle
monster.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:15.556
Daddy!

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:16.391
Daddy, stop.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:17.776
What's wrong?

01:13:17.777 --> 01:13:19.160
I'm too old for
the tickle monster.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.095
Too old for
the tickle monster?

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:24.799
How you guys doin'?

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:27.101
It's good to see you.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.102
Good to see you too.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:28.936
You look incredible.

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:29.771
Thank you.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:30.605
You remember Ben.

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:32.340
Yeah, hey Ben,
good to see you.

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:33.408
Thanks for coming.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.242
Oh, are you kidding me?

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.476
Thanks for having us,

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:37.545
I'm so excited to see this
place, it's looking great.

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:40.982
Yeah, it's been a long
road but it's finally here.

01:13:40.984 --> 01:13:41.883
Go one in, enjoy yourself.

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:43.684
It's an open bar.

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.519
Uh oh, look out.

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:45.953
Yeah.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.323
You look great.

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:50.792
Thanks, you too.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:52.761
Thanks.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.530
God, I'm really proud of you.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:59.700
You know, I didn't think
that we were...

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:00.735
I know, I know.

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:01.737
Me too.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:04.605
Okay.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.278
Steve, can you talk to Logan,

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.480
he's still adjusting.

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.584
Yeah, I'll have a
chat with him.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.320
Thank you.

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:21.022
No problem.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.490
get in there
and go enjoy yourself.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:25.828
Have fun.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.133
Good to see you, Steve.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:32.967
Hey, Miriam.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.335
Yeah, you look nice.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:35.870
Thank you, thank you
for coming.

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.071
Oh, of course.

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:39.207
I appreciate the invite.

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:41.542
Oh, get in there
and have some fun.

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:42.376
It's good to see you.

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:44.178
It's good to see you.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.012
Hi Dad.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:45.913
Hey bud.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:46.915
You okay?

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.352
Ben treating you nicely?

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:56.591
You know bud,

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.962
he's a part of you life now.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:01.996
It's okay to like Ben.

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:04.466
Do you like Ben?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.003
I do like him.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.738
You wanna know why I like Ben?

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.473
He's good to the people I love.

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:14.509
You, Taylor, your mom.

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.378
He doesn't play
soccer with me.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.081
It's okay, I'll play soccer
with you anytime you want.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.315
Does that sound good?

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:23.417
Yeah, I love you Dad.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:24.952
I love you too, buddy.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:25.954
You hungry?

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:27.622
Yup.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:28.864
Good, let's go get some grub.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.182
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:56.984
tonight it gives
me great pleasure

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:00.521
to introduce you to my
friend, my business partner,

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:04.158
and man responsible for the
amazing honey ginger salmon

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.459
that melts in your mouth,

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:07.328
Mr. Steve Anderson.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:14.770
Thank you, guys.

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.072
I just...

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.740
Seeing all of you here,

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.710
I can't tell you how much
that means to David and I.

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:27.448
I never thought my life
would end up like this.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:31.285
Looking back,
it's the unexpected occurrences in my life

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:33.554
that now seem to be
the most rewarding.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.758
I look around at
all of you here,

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.194
and I'm overwhelmed with
an amount of gratitude.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.264
If I've learned anything
from this whole experience,

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:47.034
it's that life
is forever changing,

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:49.437
and it's never too late for a
new start,

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.339
to go chase a dream.

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:53.341
And I wanna thank you
guys for all being here,

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:55.409
to watch the Honey Bee
come to fruition.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:01.315
Without further ado, big
surprise, all the way from LA,

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:02.783
Wings on the Road.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.852
This is a new one.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:07.555
It's dedicated to my sister,
Sarah.

01:17:07.557 --> 01:17:10.491
Chicago is gaining one hell
of a writer next summer.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.480
Whoo!

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:25.786
I've got blisters on my
fingers.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:26.788
Ow!

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:34.395
Ow!

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.263
Take this thing back, will ya?
