Ladies, gentlemen,

00:04.583 --> 00:09.750
the missing mutant scientists
and I have built
a mutants-only asteroid.

00:09.750 --> 00:14.750
Where any mutant may
live apart from humanity,
free from its cruelty.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.958
My mission is peaceful.

00:16.958 --> 00:20.708
Any intervention
would make it otherwise.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.708
Magneto’s got missiles
up there.

00:22.708 --> 00:25.083
He says they’re defensive.
But how can I take that chance?

00:25.083 --> 00:29.625
If I can speak with him,
I’m certain
we’ll find a peaceful solution.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.958
You thinking about
moseying skyward?

00:31.958 --> 00:35.333
Don’t worry, chere.
Gambit’s got no bags packed.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.458
-You’re coming back, Cajun?
-Promise, chere.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.000
I will not tolerate

00:40.000 --> 00:42.833
-your endangering my asteroid.
-I renounce you!

00:42.833 --> 00:45.083
You renounce me?

00:45.083 --> 00:51.833
You will serve our cause
much better
as a martyr.

slowing down!

your lives,
take us to the shuttle!

You go on.
Gambit will hold them off.

We may not be able
to wait for you.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.250
So then Gambit become
the first X-Man in orbit.

02:27.958 --> 02:31.750
Now we’re playing a new game,
and it’s Gambit’s deal.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.708
I’ll take care of him.

It is our pursuers,

On Asteroid M.

04:25.458 --> 04:28.458
I should’ve known
he’d sneak out on us!

04:28.458 --> 04:30.083
It is not what you think!

04:30.083 --> 04:33.416
Gambit had no intention
of staying with Magneto.

04:33.416 --> 04:36.875
His sacrifice
allowed us to escape.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.708
-Sacrifice?
-Do not worry.

We shall get him back

is Charles Xavier?
-I am Xavier.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.750

to speak to the President.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.875
What about Gambit?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.083
I’m afraid
our return to Asteroid M
will have to wait a few hours.

It is imperative that
we inform the world’s

you could get away with it?

That we would allow him
to go unavenged?

-He’s a traitor to mutants!
-Kill him!

to you only as Magneto,

Magnus had a tragic past.

down a destructive path.

06:33.166 --> 06:37.250

to spare future generations

to endure.
Though I abhorred his methods,

of his character.

But it ain’t Magneto

try again?

like you miss me.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.416
ROGUE: Remy, when
I get my hands
on you...

18:12.250 --> 18:13.958
(ALL SCREAMING)

18:15.458 --> 18:19.250
I have come for the one
who betrayed me.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.875
Have mercy!

18:23.000 --> 18:24.458
Look like our cue to go.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.375
I live only for you, my...

18:30.958 --> 18:33.958
-Chere!
-Come on!

18:33.958 --> 18:37.375
Just like you to be running
around with another woman.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.166
What took you so long, chere?

18:42.166 --> 18:44.750
Gambit had to hold this place
on his own.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.208
Just take it easy, hotshot.

18:47.208 --> 18:51.083
And next time you go
gallivanting around some
big old space rock,

18:51.083 --> 18:53.833
why don’t you take
someone along
to look after you.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.166
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

18:55.166 --> 18:56.875
You’re making me sick.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.958
Make one last pass.

19:00.958 --> 19:05.000
(TELEPATHIC) Magnus, you must
come with us.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.625
Thank you, Charles.
But if my dream must die,

19:08.625 --> 19:11.875
I must see it through
to the end, alone.

19:11.875 --> 19:14.875
In time, the world might have
learned to trust us.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.000
Now that hope has been lost.

19:21.125 --> 19:25.458
Do not concern
yourself. I shall survive it.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.125
Why did you offer to save
Magneto?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.958
He is my friend.
Nothing can change that.

19:45.958 --> 19:49.750
And what is there for him now,
Charles? His dream is gone.

19:49.750 --> 19:54.875
He could help us. As you could,
Amelia, to fulfill my dream.

19:54.875 --> 19:59.958
Working for a better future for
all, mutant and human alike.

19:59.958 --> 20:04.125
A generous offer, Charles
Xavier, given our
past together.

20:06.625 --> 20:10.000
But I just tried
following another man’s dream.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It is time I discovered my own.

20:15.458 --> 20:20.333
-Where am I?
-APOCALYPSE: With your
true savior.

20:20.333 --> 20:25.000
I don’t understand.
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.625
APOCALYPSE: You were saved
from the asteroid

20:27.625 --> 20:32.958
because your talents will
prove useful to me very soon.

20:32.958 --> 20:36.250
But who are you?

20:36.250 --> 20:39.416
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

20:44.208 --> 20:46.125
