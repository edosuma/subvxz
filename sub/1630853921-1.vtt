02:08.461 --> 02:10.005
<i>Piglet!</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:13.091
<i>Come home!</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:19.306
<i>It's better to die
in freedom from starvation</i>

02:19.723 --> 02:22.184
<i>than to be satiated in slavery.</i>

02:22.434 --> 02:24.061
Piglet!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.939
<i>Farmer's daughter Kirke</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:30.150
<i>took a more pessimistic view
on the liberation.</i>

02:30.442 --> 02:32.361
<i>Dwelling upon the likelihood</i>

02:32.528 --> 02:35.322
<i>that the piglet
had already been torn to pieces</i>

02:35.531 --> 02:38.075
<i>and devoured
by the local wolves.</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:50.379
<i>The animal had no idea
that his first day of freedom</i>

02:50.587 --> 02:51.755
<i>would soon end up</i>

02:51.922 --> 02:54.967
<i>in the most ridiculous
and incredible accident…</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:58.345
<i>To be caused
by the main hero of our tale,</i>

02:58.679 --> 03:02.933
<i>Samuel or Chef Sam
as he liked to be called.</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:08.355
<i>The young man had arrived in
a country that he had never heard of</i>

03:08.647 --> 03:12.776
<i>to find his father
he had never seen before.</i>

03:32.004 --> 03:33.005
Hey!

03:33.589 --> 03:34.715
Hey, hey, hey!

03:35.299 --> 03:37.217
- Do you speak English?
- No.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.804
Do you know this man?

03:42.306 --> 03:43.724
His name is Lazins.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.893
Ladins... Hey!

03:46.476 --> 03:47.477
Hey!

03:48.687 --> 03:50.189
What the fuck!

04:08.415 --> 04:10.584
<i>Destination not found.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:14.129
No, no, no, no! Come on!

04:39.488 --> 04:40.489
Fuck!

04:40.822 --> 04:41.823
Fuck.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.852
You owe me, you know that, right?

05:57.191 --> 05:58.317
Do you know Lazdins?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.951
What the fuck am I saying?
Just a fucking pig.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.482
Hello?

08:31.303 --> 08:36.058
Watch where
you're going! Don't drive so fast!

08:36.225 --> 08:37.476
I don't understand.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.358
Oh, it's alive...

08:44.942 --> 08:45.984
English?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.694
Do you speak English?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.447
Pig is a money.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.535
Fine.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.877
I'll take you home.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.676
I mean...
I even don't know where I am.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.944
- He's suffering too much.
- No. He's just too happy.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.876
<i>The only one disappointed</i>

09:44.042 --> 09:46.712
<i>by the recent turn of events,
was the piglet.</i>

09:47.045 --> 09:50.757
<i>He would have preferred
to be devoured by wolves</i>

09:50.883 --> 09:56.847
<i>rather than return
to his boring, filthy life</i>

09:57.347 --> 10:02.394
<i>surrounded by wretched congeners
and miserable human beings.</i>

10:43.602 --> 10:44.603
Dammit!

10:45.812 --> 10:47.272
Loose again.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.529
Wait, wait. Let me do it.

11:06.875 --> 11:07.960
Here you go.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.861
And you?

11:35.821 --> 11:36.989
I don't drink.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.119
Okay.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.755
Where are you from?

12:41.470 --> 12:42.971
I come from...

12:45.557 --> 12:46.808
...a noisy place.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.353
Not like this.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.857
There's almost...

12:55.108 --> 12:56.902
...no people left out here.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.404
Just pigs.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.700
And we're selling them
little by little.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.746
Maybe we'll have to
move to the city.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.708
I guess you can't wait to do that.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.753
No.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.090
No, I want to stay here.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.761
Just like my mother wanted.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.813
Do you know a man named...

13:34.356 --> 13:35.357
Ladzins?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.195
Lazins?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.699
La... La... Ladzins

13:43.991 --> 13:46.201
Do you know him? You know him.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.289
No.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.753
You're probably tired.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.589
I...

14:19.651 --> 14:21.069
Don't be scared.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.864
My mum won't disturb your sleep.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.742
She was an English teacher.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.624
This is the best place.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.400
Stay as long as you like.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.904
We have... plenty of room and...

15:05.030 --> 15:06.031
...food.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.950
That's very kind, but I've...

15:09.618 --> 15:11.495
…got to get going
in the morning.

15:39.106 --> 15:43.902
<i>Hot food, a warm bed
and the caring hands of a woman</i>

15:44.111 --> 15:48.824
<i>are enough to soothe the brow
of the most frantic traveler.</i>

15:49.575 --> 15:54.037
<i>Soon he would forget not only
about searching for his father</i>

15:54.246 --> 15:59.501
<i>but also about his faithful
companion, loneliness.</i>

15:59.626 --> 16:02.421
<i>Or as he called it, freedom.</i>

16:04.882 --> 16:09.845
<i>Peace of mind was such a rare state
in the life of this young man.</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:20.063
<i>Kirke tried very hard
to dismiss the thought</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:23.317
<i>that soon she would
never see him again.</i>

16:24.568 --> 16:26.528
<i>She was enormously impressed</i>

16:26.653 --> 16:29.031
<i>by the nobleness
of the foreigner's manner.</i>

16:29.448 --> 16:33.577
<i>And the feeling of empathy
she believed he had for her.</i>

16:38.415 --> 16:41.752
<i>Indeed the young lady was grateful
to her mother</i>

16:41.960 --> 16:43.795
<i>for such a generous gift.</i>

16:46.381 --> 16:47.966
Thank you.

17:12.366 --> 17:13.367
Hi!

17:28.590 --> 17:29.758
What's going on?

17:32.678 --> 17:35.138
Your mother
has to stare at his ass.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.099
He is a good one, Dad.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.185
He's strong. A real foreigner.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.314
I want him to stay.

17:47.276 --> 17:50.237
Maybe if you
ask him about Lazins?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.114
Ladzins?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.074
Yeah!

17:54.283 --> 17:55.450
Lagzdins!

17:56.201 --> 17:58.412
Yeah.
You know where I can find him?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.375
Jancuks!

18:04.251 --> 18:06.461
He looks harder than your skull!

18:06.628 --> 18:09.882
Can you translate?
I don't understand.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.363
You said you were going
to feed him to the pigs.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.533
Maybe I'll give that piglet to you.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.787
It'll give my foreigner
ideas of running away.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.583
He'll burn down your farm.

18:45.751 --> 18:49.004
Let's chop him up
and feed to the pigs.

18:49.129 --> 18:53.675
The foreigner is mine!
I'll do what I want with him.

18:58.764 --> 19:00.641
Your house is a mess, Kirke!

19:00.766 --> 19:04.269
You are a woman and
women can't keep things tidy!

19:04.770 --> 19:07.439
I've told you
what women are good for!

19:07.606 --> 19:10.484
As if you knew
what women are good for!

19:14.696 --> 19:17.282
- He's our property!
- Stop it!

19:17.533 --> 19:19.868
Let's bring his things inside.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.748
Don't you dare touch him!

19:49.273 --> 19:52.776
<i>Jancuks
had grown up in these parts.</i>

19:52.901 --> 19:56.530
<i>He had never known anything
but the sun, the trees</i>

19:56.697 --> 19:59.032
<i>and the ambition to marry Kirke.</i>

20:00.492 --> 20:03.245
<i>Neither the old man
nor his daughter</i>

20:03.453 --> 20:06.582
<i>suspected the aspirations
of their frequent guest.</i>

20:08.792 --> 20:12.504
<i>In some dark corner
of his tiny jealous mind,</i>

20:13.172 --> 20:16.049
<i>he imagined Sam touching Kirke.</i>

20:17.676 --> 20:19.636
<i>The graphic image he summoned up</i>

20:19.803 --> 20:23.515
<i>irritated and aroused him
in equal measure.</i>

20:28.562 --> 20:31.023
Don't go to him, he'll kill you.

20:31.565 --> 20:36.445
- Go home to your daddies.
- It’s for your own good!

20:36.612 --> 20:41.575
If you touch her,
I'll cut your balls off!

20:42.492 --> 20:45.245
- Tell him what I said.
- Get lost!

20:51.543 --> 20:52.920
Let me go!

21:19.404 --> 21:20.614
Look at me!

21:21.365 --> 21:22.324
Look at me!

21:25.202 --> 21:26.870
You son of a bitch!

23:33.205 --> 23:34.456
Now watch.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.142
Mix.

23:54.935 --> 23:55.936
And feed.

23:57.521 --> 24:00.858
Alright, stop it.
Let him do the work.

24:03.694 --> 24:04.695
Like this.

24:15.205 --> 24:16.790
Get to it!

24:18.417 --> 24:19.501
Please.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.420
Do it.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.759
You will get some normal food.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.304
If you do what I say.

24:31.972 --> 24:32.973
If not...

24:34.308 --> 24:35.809
...my father will punish you.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.145
Believe me,
I don't want it to happen.

24:56.163 --> 24:57.247
This is for you.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.532
I'm not your pig.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.284
- You dirty...
- Dad, let him starve.

25:35.494 --> 25:36.495
That'll teach him.

25:37.287 --> 25:40.582
Tell him that next time
I'll feed him to the pigs.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.552
If you want to be happy...

25:53.178 --> 25:54.680
...you have to obey.

27:39.243 --> 27:42.246
No, no, no, no!
Hey! Hey! Shh!

27:42.412 --> 27:43.914
Shh! Hey! Shh!

27:45.415 --> 27:46.416
Hey, hey!

27:47.417 --> 27:48.418
Shee!

27:49.586 --> 27:51.088
Shh! Shh!

28:35.215 --> 28:36.925
Gustavs, it reeks here!

28:39.887 --> 28:43.015
Look at the pigs suffering
in this shithole.

28:57.362 --> 28:58.572
Help me!

28:58.864 --> 29:01.450
Help me! Please. Help me!

29:02.951 --> 29:04.119
Help me!

29:05.662 --> 29:07.539
<i>Brothers Vilhelms and Marks</i>

29:07.664 --> 29:09.374
<i>were blessed by good health,</i>

29:09.541 --> 29:12.503
<i>pragmatic minds
and senseless hearts.</i>

29:12.711 --> 29:14.963
<i>These qualities were perfect</i>

29:15.088 --> 29:18.217
<i>for managing and maintaining
a prosperous farm.</i>

29:19.635 --> 29:23.013
<i>The brothers lived in harmony
with their chickens, cows,</i>

29:23.180 --> 29:27.059
<i>turkeys and their faithful,
but clumsy Jancuks.</i>

29:28.894 --> 29:29.895
Please!

29:30.854 --> 29:31.855
Please!

29:33.982 --> 29:35.442
Hey, hey, help me! Help!

29:35.651 --> 29:37.486
Hey, help me! Help!

29:38.445 --> 29:41.240
<i>At this moment,
they had a great chance</i>

29:41.323 --> 29:44.201
<i>of replacing him
with a better labourer.</i>

29:45.244 --> 29:46.286
Please!

29:47.663 --> 29:52.251
Now he works here.
But Kirke and I - we just rest.

29:53.961 --> 29:57.965
His arms and legs are
more impressive than his work.

29:58.632 --> 29:59.633
Jancuks!

30:00.509 --> 30:01.510
Come here!

30:06.014 --> 30:07.975
- Show us your arms!
- Why?

30:09.059 --> 30:10.727
Show us your arms.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.325
We want to buy the foreigner.

30:25.659 --> 30:30.038
- Don't! He's a dickhead.
- Shut up.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.207
Dad, he eats a lot.

30:32.541 --> 30:34.543
We'll take eight pigs
and the foreigner.

30:34.585 --> 30:37.254
Plus half a ton of fodder
for you.

30:39.673 --> 30:43.385
He was sent by God.
I can't sell him.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.763
It would be
like spitting in God's face.

30:46.930 --> 30:48.473
He'd take offence.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.814
We'll talk about that later.

30:56.565 --> 31:00.319
I'll speak to God Almighty.

31:00.736 --> 31:05.282
He is much kinder to us
than he is to you, Gustavs.

31:05.741 --> 31:06.742
Okay.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.369
This is a good one.

31:09.620 --> 31:13.457
That one has a bent back.
We'll take it anyway.

31:13.582 --> 31:16.543
- It's a healthy pig.
- It's got a weak back.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.003
Jancuks, mark it!

31:58.043 --> 31:59.586
Shh! Quiet!

32:23.110 --> 32:25.404
Come on! Come on!

32:25.988 --> 32:27.114
Come on!

32:36.206 --> 32:37.207
Come on!

32:38.333 --> 32:40.836
Come on!
Before she starts screaming!

32:56.185 --> 32:57.269
Stop!

33:16.872 --> 33:20.417
He'll fuck you
and fuck up your farm too!

33:38.894 --> 33:40.979
I hate you! Dirty dog!

33:41.188 --> 33:43.607
I'd rather die than be with you!

33:43.857 --> 33:46.026
You stinky creep!

33:47.945 --> 33:48.946
Hang on!

33:52.866 --> 33:53.867
Come here.

33:55.702 --> 33:56.703
Come here.

33:58.372 --> 33:59.373
Come closer.

33:59.957 --> 34:00.958
Come.

34:01.542 --> 34:02.543
Come.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.128
Kiss me.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.803
Shut up!

34:13.053 --> 34:15.054
I'll cut your nose off.

34:15.222 --> 34:18.433
Even the pigs
will be scared of you.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.791
Get lost!

34:42.875 --> 34:46.210
And thank the old men
that I didn't shoot you.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.670
Old fool!

34:48.422 --> 34:49.797
What are you lying there?

34:51.425 --> 34:52.967
Get up, let's go.

34:55.637 --> 34:56.972
What did he say?

34:58.515 --> 35:00.767
He thanked you
for saving my life.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.732
I only saved your nose.

35:39.932 --> 35:41.099
Dad loves you.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.607
Why did you lure me here?

35:58.408 --> 36:00.244
You offered me the ride.

36:01.453 --> 36:02.704
I never asked for that.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.376
You tricked me.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.003
You drank my vodka.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.589
I never forced you to.

36:27.521 --> 36:28.814
Now it's time to work.

36:38.532 --> 36:43.453
<i>The hard physical work
was a way to disperse thoughts</i>

36:43.620 --> 36:47.040
<i>about the inhuman conditions
of his existence</i>

36:47.332 --> 36:49.710
<i>to which Sam
had become accustomed.</i>

36:51.920 --> 36:54.298
<i>The shower reassured the pigs</i>

36:54.506 --> 36:57.593
<i>that someone
was taking care of them.</i>

37:01.138 --> 37:03.891
<i>Cleanliness is to some a virtue,</i>

37:04.016 --> 37:07.519
<i>to some a necessity,
to others - a luxury.</i>

37:21.950 --> 37:25.495
I'll give you
a new chain, Foreigner.

37:25.704 --> 37:29.416
If you work hard,
I'll make the chain even longer.

37:30.584 --> 37:34.588
So that you can get to the shed
and chop some firewood.

37:36.256 --> 37:39.885
I only sold eight pigs
to those bastards.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.012
We still need a pair of hands.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.015
You see, Kirke...

37:46.141 --> 37:47.351
She's a woman.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.438
And I'm not as strong
as I used to be.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.361
It's a serious business,
Foreigner.

37:58.111 --> 38:00.113
Our farm was falling apart.

38:00.739 --> 38:04.201
Life is not worth living
if I have to sell all the pigs.

38:09.748 --> 38:13.085
Such a pity
you don't understand me.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.925
It's not like you could
say a word.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.211
Hey! Come!

39:38.504 --> 39:39.505
Come here.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.381
Pigs, work.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.134
Work!

39:45.552 --> 39:46.553
Here!

39:48.222 --> 39:49.223
Bang!

39:54.478 --> 39:55.479
Slam!

39:57.689 --> 39:58.690
Dead!

40:00.025 --> 40:01.026
Pig - dead!

40:04.821 --> 40:05.822
No.

40:06.365 --> 40:08.116
Tomorrow, a party.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.869
No. No, no, no. No. No.

40:13.997 --> 40:17.459
Damn.
I'll have to do it myself.

40:18.168 --> 40:19.628
Watch and learn.

40:20.003 --> 40:21.421
You swing it back...

40:21.672 --> 40:22.673
And - bang!

40:30.013 --> 40:31.223
Come here.

41:06.300 --> 41:07.301
Mamma.

41:09.011 --> 41:10.137
Fuck!

41:12.139 --> 41:13.307
My mamma.

41:34.411 --> 41:37.122
Stop moving.
The party starts soon.

41:37.289 --> 41:40.167
You're not sitting with everyone
until you're clean.

41:40.501 --> 41:44.338
Dad wants to show you.
Make the brothers jealous.

41:45.756 --> 41:47.090
What do I say to people?

41:48.300 --> 41:49.718
I don't speak the language.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.346
Put a smile on your face.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.097
Look pretty, I guess.

41:55.349 --> 41:56.475
Turn your back.

42:02.231 --> 42:03.357
Bend over.

42:15.744 --> 42:18.121
You have to wash
from time to time.

42:19.331 --> 42:21.542
Sets a good example
to the other pigs.

42:22.668 --> 42:23.752
I'm not a pig.

42:24.211 --> 42:25.504
I’m not finished.

42:33.762 --> 42:35.722
Stop thinking too hard.

42:36.181 --> 42:38.642
In this world,
a pig's destiny is a sad one.

42:39.309 --> 42:40.686
We keep them to...

42:41.478 --> 42:43.146
Nomnom piggies.

42:43.814 --> 42:46.900
A pig doesn't have a choice.

42:48.777 --> 42:52.239
You are reliable.
That's a rare thing around here.

42:53.282 --> 42:56.451
I do regret selling those pigs.
But too late now.

42:56.994 --> 43:00.706
Foreigner, eat well!
You deserve it.

43:02.374 --> 43:05.878
You should be grateful
I invited you.

43:06.670 --> 43:11.592
Easy. Our guy isn't
as smart as your foreigner.

43:12.342 --> 43:17.014
I hope your dog teaches him
all about loyalty and obedience.

43:17.139 --> 43:19.683
Try stealing my foreigner

43:19.808 --> 43:22.769
and I'll feed
that dimwit of yours to my pigs.

43:23.228 --> 43:25.981
Oh! What a juicy bite!

43:26.190 --> 43:31.528
See, you were wrong.
You should have bought that pig.

44:21.370 --> 44:22.579
Hey, you.

44:24.581 --> 44:26.458
You can have some too.

44:29.837 --> 44:31.672
That bastard ruined everything!

44:31.839 --> 44:33.841
I said, don't underestimate him.

44:34.007 --> 44:38.470
You could have had it all!
The pigs and the whole farm!

44:38.929 --> 44:41.181
You had to marry me with Kirke!

44:45.060 --> 44:46.854
And who'd have had it all then?

44:47.855 --> 44:49.273
We or you?

44:53.151 --> 44:56.488
Are we like warty dogs to you?

44:57.114 --> 44:59.283
Dad, I never said that!

45:01.118 --> 45:03.245
Can you speak like a dog?

45:03.662 --> 45:06.081
I always do
everything you tell me to.

45:06.456 --> 45:07.958
On all fours!

45:14.798 --> 45:15.966
Stop it.

45:16.216 --> 45:18.594
Do what the master tells you to.

45:32.149 --> 45:33.859
And now, bark!

45:34.193 --> 45:36.820
Bark like your father barked
in that fire.

45:40.073 --> 45:41.200
I can't hear you.

45:43.702 --> 45:45.162
I can't hear you!

45:48.123 --> 45:49.499
Can't hear you!

45:52.252 --> 45:53.921
And remember...

45:54.296 --> 45:57.216
Never say what you really think.

45:58.509 --> 46:01.512
Do what we tell you to! Got it?

46:02.429 --> 46:03.430
Yes.

46:03.555 --> 46:05.349
- Yes, what?
- Yes, Master!

46:05.599 --> 46:07.100
In dog language!

46:07.768 --> 46:10.604
From now on, you'll
be speaking dog language.

46:20.572 --> 46:22.991
If you don't want them
to have your bone...

46:23.200 --> 46:25.911
Show them who's the strongest!

46:48.267 --> 46:51.061
Hands off, Foreigner!
Don't rush it.

46:51.603 --> 46:53.897
You don't deserve her yet.

46:56.859 --> 46:58.193
You should go.

50:01.752 --> 50:04.713
The foreigner is running away!

50:08.884 --> 50:10.761
I was not gonna run, you idiots!

50:11.136 --> 50:12.804
I have a chain around my neck.

50:25.651 --> 50:27.778
<i>Despite Kirke's certainty</i>

50:27.986 --> 50:31.823
<i>regarding the righteousness
of the punishment</i>

50:32.282 --> 50:35.953
<i>she still took pleasure
in having a man beside her.</i>

50:36.203 --> 50:40.457
<i>One who listened, obeyed
and even smiled sometimes.</i>

50:47.172 --> 50:51.927
<i>Instead of finding his father,
Sam had met the first woman</i>

50:52.261 --> 50:54.930
<i>who had succeeded
in making him suffer.</i>

50:55.931 --> 50:58.976
<i>For now, the torment
was merely physical.</i>

50:59.643 --> 51:04.314
<i>Mental torture was no more
than a promise for the future.</i>

51:21.123 --> 51:22.833
Why isn't he helping us?

51:23.375 --> 51:26.628
They're your pigs now.
You deal with them.

51:27.254 --> 51:31.008
Let him sit on a shorter chain
for a while.

51:47.232 --> 51:48.233
What?

51:49.818 --> 51:52.196
There's no way out of this.
Leave!

52:15.552 --> 52:18.347
Hey, idiot! You lost one!

52:41.954 --> 52:43.288
Try to catch it!

52:49.086 --> 52:51.547
Go, Jancuks, go!

54:33.524 --> 54:35.025
Faster!

54:35.943 --> 54:37.736
Run faster!

55:16.942 --> 55:19.903
<i>The lonely heart
of an abandoned woman</i>

55:20.070 --> 55:22.114
<i>is sad and cruel.</i>

55:24.283 --> 55:26.410
<i>Kirke would prefer to die</i>

55:26.577 --> 55:29.830
<i>rather than return
to her boring, lonely life</i>

55:30.539 --> 55:33.876
<i>with the stubborn,
sickly half-witted father.</i>

55:35.335 --> 55:36.670
Stay at home!

55:36.879 --> 55:39.506
<i>The young lady
was horrified by the thought</i>

55:39.631 --> 55:44.970
<i>that Sam could have been
torn to pieces by wolves.</i>

55:48.599 --> 55:51.602
<i>If only she knew
the foreigner would soon return.</i>

55:51.768 --> 55:55.898
<i>Driven by strong feelings
and exalted intentions.</i>

57:03.590 --> 57:04.591
Fuck!

57:05.008 --> 57:06.009
Fuck!

57:06.718 --> 57:08.011
Fuck!

57:56.185 --> 57:57.603
Where did you get this?

58:14.661 --> 58:15.787
Thank you.

58:29.468 --> 58:30.677
You hear that?

58:44.691 --> 58:46.527
I dreamt of going home.

58:50.531 --> 58:51.532
No.

58:51.865 --> 58:52.991
My real home.

58:55.744 --> 58:57.329
Far away from here.

1:00:33.217 --> 1:00:35.385
<i>For the first time in his life</i>

1:00:35.552 --> 1:00:40.641
<i>Sam had so many pairs of ears
listening to his every word.</i>

1:00:40.891 --> 1:00:43.727
<i>Even though
they understood none of it.</i>

1:00:44.811 --> 1:00:50.943
<i>Sam's heart burst with
a desire to care and lead.</i>

1:00:51.151 --> 1:00:53.820
<i>But there was no one
he could love here.</i>

1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:33.902
You're a pig. I'm a human.

1:01:35.070 --> 1:01:37.781
Before we ate the same food
because there was no choice.

1:01:38.198 --> 1:01:40.075
Out here, things are different.

1:01:49.418 --> 1:01:53.839
<i>Sam's search
for Lagzdins had failed.</i>

1:01:54.047 --> 1:01:58.510
<i>He didn't have the strength
to go back home anymore.</i>

1:01:59.136 --> 1:02:02.931
<i>No one was waiting
or missing him.</i>

1:02:09.438 --> 1:02:13.692
<i>Kirke couldn't stop
thinking about him.</i>

1:02:14.026 --> 1:02:18.822
<i>Remembering happier times
when Sam was chained up</i>

1:02:18.989 --> 1:02:22.201
<i>staring at her
with his trusting eyes.</i>

1:02:26.205 --> 1:02:30.542
<i>The only thing she could do
was wait and hope.</i>

1:03:32.729 --> 1:03:34.106
<i>Love...</i>

1:03:34.439 --> 1:03:37.693
<i>What changes it wreaks
in the heart of a man!</i>

1:03:38.026 --> 1:03:40.362
<i>What strange actions,</i>

1:03:40.529 --> 1:03:43.490
<i>inexplicable
to the unaffected mind,</i>

1:03:43.699 --> 1:03:47.244
<i>has it caused
on so many occasions!</i>

1:03:48.078 --> 1:03:50.914
<i>However... unlike a woman,</i>

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:54.960
<i>a man is never able
to admit this to himself.</i>

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:05.971
It's just...

1:04:09.850 --> 1:04:12.895
I never experienced
such feelings.

1:04:16.356 --> 1:04:18.650
You want to laugh and cry
at the same time.

1:04:22.738 --> 1:04:23.822
Kirke.

1:04:51.099 --> 1:04:54.728
<i>Despite the persuasive
nature of his companions,</i>

1:04:54.937 --> 1:04:59.316
<i>Sam had a determination
to go back to Kirke.</i>

1:05:01.151 --> 1:05:05.614
<i>If only the pigs could've known
that soon they would meet</i>

1:05:05.822 --> 1:05:10.869
<i>the singularly horrifying fate
of being burned alive.</i>

1:05:13.830 --> 1:05:15.457
You don't have to follow me.

1:05:18.669 --> 1:05:20.128
For me it is.

1:05:26.468 --> 1:05:27.928
It's wolves howling.

1:05:35.060 --> 1:05:39.481
Stop shooting!
Bullets cost money.

1:05:39.773 --> 1:05:42.818
If you see the foreigner,
let me shoot him.

1:05:43.527 --> 1:05:46.113
Find the pigs, dimwit!

1:05:46.697 --> 1:05:48.448
Pigs cost money!

1:05:48.657 --> 1:05:52.452
Each minute it's more likely
we'll only find their bones.

1:05:52.619 --> 1:05:56.707
When I find Foreigner,
I'll cut his chain short.

1:05:57.624 --> 1:05:58.917
Can you shoot?

1:06:01.086 --> 1:06:02.337
You take him out.

1:06:41.835 --> 1:06:43.295
Where are the pigs?

1:06:43.879 --> 1:06:45.297
Pigs. Where?

1:06:47.049 --> 1:06:49.259
Give me the pigs,
and I'll tell no one.

1:06:49.676 --> 1:06:51.470
Or take them back to the pigsty.

1:06:51.595 --> 1:06:53.889
Pigs. Home. Fast.

1:06:54.056 --> 1:06:55.557
I'll make your chain longer.

1:06:55.724 --> 1:06:57.100
Come on!

1:06:57.226 --> 1:06:58.560
Shoot him in the leg!

1:06:58.727 --> 1:07:02.314
- He'll show us the pigs.
- Shoot him in the leg.

1:07:02.439 --> 1:07:05.359
- Where are the pigs?
- Shoot!

1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:08.153
The pigs. Where?

1:07:08.362 --> 1:07:09.363
Shoot!

1:07:09.863 --> 1:07:11.114
Run!

1:07:11.490 --> 1:07:12.991
Where are the pigs?

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:21.542
His hands are shaking!
Shoot!

1:07:21.834 --> 1:07:23.377
Just run!

1:07:53.448 --> 1:07:56.493
Careful... Foreigner!

1:07:56.660 --> 1:07:58.370
Be careful! They...

1:07:58.787 --> 1:08:00.539
They shot me in the leg.

1:08:00.664 --> 1:08:01.915
Easy.

1:08:02.124 --> 1:08:06.128
Hang on!
Don't touch the pigs.

1:08:16.721 --> 1:08:18.432
<i>Sam was grateful to fate</i>

1:08:18.682 --> 1:08:22.269
<i>for honouring him with
the chance to return to Kirke</i>

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:24.520
<i>neither a slave nor labourer,</i>

1:08:24.688 --> 1:08:29.026
<i>but as a conquering hero
in the aftermath of battle.</i>

1:08:30.444 --> 1:08:34.406
<i>The foreigner was indeed
God's gift to all.</i>

1:08:51.881 --> 1:08:54.176
Dad, drink this.
It'll ease the pain.

1:08:57.304 --> 1:08:58.971
I'm crying with happiness.

1:08:59.223 --> 1:09:02.059
I sold the pigs
and got them back again.

1:09:06.063 --> 1:09:07.898
Don't throw the pellet away.

1:09:08.814 --> 1:09:11.527
I'll put it on a string
and show it to those bastards.

1:09:11.859 --> 1:09:15.154
So that they know who is
the smartest cookie around here.

1:09:15.781 --> 1:09:18.367
They crashed their truck too!

1:09:25.707 --> 1:09:28.252
Your foreigner
is a real godsend.

1:09:28.544 --> 1:09:29.545
Kirke.

1:09:30.045 --> 1:09:31.880
Have kids with him!

1:09:34.258 --> 1:09:36.593
May God give you
healthy children.

1:09:37.094 --> 1:09:39.680
They will look after the farm
when I'm gone.

1:09:39.930 --> 1:09:41.890
Have a sip, you'll sleep better.

1:09:42.057 --> 1:09:43.267
No.

1:09:43.850 --> 1:09:46.770
I want to live
to see your wedding.

1:09:48.063 --> 1:09:51.191
I won't go to sleep
until you're married.

1:09:52.526 --> 1:09:54.111
I'll keep an eye on you.

1:10:22.556 --> 1:10:25.350
My father has lost a bullet and...

1:10:25.642 --> 1:10:27.853
...asks you to help find it.

1:10:57.424 --> 1:11:01.762
What you're looking for
might be right in front of you.

1:12:28.015 --> 1:12:30.058
You understood
what my father said?

1:12:35.022 --> 1:12:36.023
He said...

1:12:38.984 --> 1:12:40.360
He wants us to marry.

1:13:12.309 --> 1:13:13.644
Let's do it.

1:13:31.537 --> 1:13:32.913
You're burning, Kirke.

1:13:35.290 --> 1:13:36.708
Yes, I do, Sam.

1:14:21.712 --> 1:14:23.005
Why did you do that?

1:14:23.338 --> 1:14:25.757
If he touched you,
I'll kill both of you.

1:14:25.924 --> 1:14:28.343
Why did you
set fire to the pigsty?

1:14:28.677 --> 1:14:30.179
I'll go back to school!

1:14:30.262 --> 1:14:32.639
Why did you
set fire to the pigsty?

1:14:32.931 --> 1:14:34.766
Let's run away
from the parents!

1:14:48.322 --> 1:14:49.615
Hey!

1:15:48.131 --> 1:15:49.716
Dear congregation.

1:15:51.552 --> 1:15:53.387
We have come here...

1:15:53.512 --> 1:15:58.183
<i>Despite being innocent
of the arson at the pig farm,</i>

1:15:58.433 --> 1:16:02.980
<i>Vilhelms and Marks
paid compensation for the losses</i>

1:16:03.063 --> 1:16:05.649
<i>and agreed to bury the hatchet.</i>

1:16:06.066 --> 1:16:08.652
<i>Soon they would lose
all their livestock</i>

1:16:08.819 --> 1:16:12.739
<i>to an outbreak of bird flu
and face bankruptcy.</i>

1:16:13.907 --> 1:16:17.286
<i>They would later be found
hanging in the chicken coop.</i>

1:16:17.494 --> 1:16:20.664
God bless your children
and your family. Amen.

1:16:22.457 --> 1:16:25.794
May God bless you
and protect you.

1:16:26.587 --> 1:16:27.588
Amen.

1:16:35.095 --> 1:16:38.348
<i>Gustavs never saw
his bloodline continue.</i>

1:16:39.266 --> 1:16:42.978
<i>His old heart stopped beating
on their wedding night.</i>

1:19:01.074 --> 1:19:03.911
<i>The pig's farewell
filled Sam's heart</i>

1:19:04.119 --> 1:19:07.080
<i>with an
all-encompassing sadness.</i>

1:19:07.289 --> 1:19:09.416
<i>At this moment, he realized</i>

1:19:09.541 --> 1:19:13.253
<i>his journey had been devoid
of any sense or meaning.</i>

1:19:13.420 --> 1:19:17.966
<i>Having given up his freedom
and not having found Lagzdins.</i>

1:19:23.889 --> 1:19:27.059
<i>Suddenly,
Sam was racked with doubt.</i>

1:19:27.309 --> 1:19:29.853
<i>He wondered
if he should abandon Kirke</i>

1:19:29.978 --> 1:19:31.855
<i>and to continue his journey.</i>

1:19:32.064 --> 1:19:33.649
<i>Even though in freedom</i>

1:19:33.815 --> 1:19:37.444
<i>he would encounter
even greater threats.</i>
