Your eyesight

but I don't
think they're me.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.001
Hello, Mr. Peepers.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.603
Oh, hello, Nonny.

20:37.669 --> 20:40.339
I'd like to pick up
my glasses, please.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.941
Why, yes.
You're just in time.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.344
We were about to
close for the day.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.512
Let me go get them.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.914
GUPPIES:
Hi, Nonny!

20:48.981 --> 20:51.984
You found the store
all by yourself!

20:52.050 --> 20:54.019
Yes, I used my senses.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.289
Here they are, Nonny.
All fixed.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.826
I will put
them on for you.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.097
GIL:
Whoa!

21:05.163 --> 21:06.465
MR. GROUPER:
Hmm...

21:06.531 --> 21:09.534
Um, I don't think
these are my glasses.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.737
I think they look great!

21:11.803 --> 21:15.440
I think that those
might be my glasses.

21:15.507 --> 21:19.044
Yes, I think
you're right.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.348
NONNY:
That's better.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.017
Thank you.

21:25.083 --> 21:28.353
How does it feel to have
your glasses back, Nonny?

21:28.420 --> 21:33.091
I feel...

21:33.158 --> 21:37.029
...like me.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.564
(Guppies cheering)

21:42.701 --> 21:45.303
I'm so glad that Nonny
got his glasses fixed.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.705
Me, too.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.608
And he used his other
senses to help him.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.209
Hey, that reminds me.

21:51.276 --> 21:54.946
I never found Bubble Puppy
using only my ears.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.448
Bubble Puppy!

21:56.515 --> 21:58.283
Where are you, boy?

21:58.350 --> 22:00.252
Ah, there you are, boy!

22:00.318 --> 22:01.453
Time for your walk!

22:01.520 --> 22:03.155
Uh, Gilly, that's not--

22:03.221 --> 22:06.058
Now just hold still
and I'll put your leash on.

22:06.124 --> 22:07.459
There we go!

22:07.526 --> 22:09.394
Ready for our walk, boy?

22:09.461 --> 22:11.229
Ahem.

22:11.296 --> 22:12.998
Woof.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.766
Ahhh!

22:14.833 --> 22:17.602
