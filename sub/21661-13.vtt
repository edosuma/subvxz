WEBVTT

01:24.292 --> 01:25.126
What's up?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.254
What do you want to talk about?

01:31.633 --> 01:32.884
I'm sorry about...

01:34.552 --> 01:35.386
last time.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.434
I'm sorry for texting you nonstop, too.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.024
I'm sure there are a lot more
I should be sorry for.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.697
This was my first relationship
and my first breakup,

01:55.990 --> 01:57.242
so that's why.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.787
Because it was the first time
I felt these emotions.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.626
Still, I shouldn't have done that.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.379
I'm sorry.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.054
And thank you.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.060
For letting me learn

02:24.853 --> 02:26.187
what it's like to be loved,

02:29.232 --> 02:30.984
and for letting me learn...

02:33.069 --> 02:34.529
what it's like to like someone.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.994
I wanted to thank you.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.248
I felt like I really had to say that.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.507
Thank you.

03:01.973 --> 03:02.974
Jong-yeoul.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.687
May I ask you for a favor?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.191
Sure.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.321
If you date someone else,

03:18.114 --> 03:20.950
don't call her a knucklehead.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.955
Okay.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.335
If you date someone else,

03:31.085 --> 03:32.795
wait a little longer.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.091
Okay.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.179
Don't be too nice to me.
I'll get confused again.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.645
But don't be too mean to me either.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.150
Okay.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.281
I'm really glad

04:01.074 --> 04:03.076
that you were my first love.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.211
I'm sorry.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.880
Bye.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.761
Goodbye.

05:40.506 --> 05:46.596
EPISODE 13
SEEING ONESELF #AllthePrettyHorses

06:00.151 --> 06:01.611
We need to do this much.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.407
Did you find them?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.118
Here they are.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.838
-Hey...
-Talk later. I'm busy. Bye.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.298
-Later...
-Go already.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.387
Is she playing hard to get?

06:32.266 --> 06:34.018
She should be home soon.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.686
Should I call her?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.068
She's coming.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.664
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

06:58.042 --> 06:59.627
-What is this?
-Blow.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.338
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BREAKUP

07:02.421 --> 07:03.548
Did it go well?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.259
I forgot a few things.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.973
"Even if we have nothing to do
with each other, be happy."

07:12.515 --> 07:14.559
I should have said that.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.562
Lend me that. I want to use it
when I get dumped.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.771
You'd better not.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.190
When do we open this?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.361
Hey. You should've popped it
when she walked in.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.488
-Give it to me.
-I don't know how to open it.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.241
Come in again.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.452
Careful.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.793
Okay. Here is to first breakup
of our youngest.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.045
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.173
Bottoms up.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.677
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST BREAKUP

07:49.760 --> 07:52.054
Your eyes are swollen.
You need an ice pack.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.558
I can say this now,
but it was dangerous for a bit.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.312
You're right. I was afraid
she would turn into a stalker.

07:59.395 --> 08:03.566
Really? How come I didn't know?
Did you know, too?

08:05.109 --> 08:07.153
You were in your dark stage back then.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.447
Excuse me.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.576
Hey. Did you find him?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.457
Really? Is he famous?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.543
What is his address?

08:23.711 --> 08:24.545
Okay.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.257
Okay.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
Paju Hoedong-gil

08:30.927 --> 08:32.929
Why won't you eat?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.231
What are you doing?

08:43.397 --> 08:46.108
Mom. Nabi won't eat this.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.695
Let's go in and wash your hands
and get ready to...

08:53.241 --> 08:54.116
Who are you?

08:56.786 --> 08:59.580
Is this Mr. Gwan-young Han's place?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.884
I don't drink coffee,
so is oolong tea okay?

09:12.468 --> 09:14.387
Yes, anything is fine.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.610
So, which grade school did you say?

09:30.861 --> 09:34.282
Ganae Elementary School.
It's in Gwangcheon.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.742
Ganae Elementary School.

09:41.539 --> 09:45.835
Yes. The creek behind the school
was really nice.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.425
So, Ji-won Song.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.265
I'm sorry.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.726
I don't have the best memory.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.727
So...

10:03.853 --> 10:05.146
were you in the art department?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.441
No. I was terrible at art.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.114
I was talking about the past with friends,
and was reminded of you.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.827
Do you remember Yun-woo Jung?
She was the president of class 3-2.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.621
Her father had a poultry farm.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.873
Yun-woo Jung?

10:25.791 --> 10:26.792
I don't recall.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.130
Do you remember Sang-eun Cho?

10:31.255 --> 10:33.299
Her parents had the supermarket
right by the school.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.051
Sang-eun Cho...

10:35.760 --> 10:37.136
My goodness.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.016
They say old memories come back to you
when you get old.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.562
I don't know if I'm still young,
or if I'm just stupid.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.360
Do you remember Hyo-jin Moon?

10:55.905 --> 10:59.450
Her dad had passed away
and her mom worked in a restaurant.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.169
-Dad, I'm leaving.
-Okay.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.047
I made dinner, so heat up the stew, okay?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.006
Okay.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.680
Your wife...

11:22.848 --> 11:23.891
Two years ago.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.159
How's the tea? Is it okay?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.286
Yes, it's good.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.173
-Have a nice day.
-Get home safely.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.571
-Did you recognize him?
-No. Not at all.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.531
He's an average old man.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.742
He has white hair,
but he looks kind of young for his age.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.078
Anyway, he's not what I expected.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.248
What did you expect?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.000
I expected him to be...

12:36.213 --> 12:37.506
You're right.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.511
Look.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.974
So, which grade school did you say?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.811
Ganae Elementary School.
It's in Gwangcheon.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.149
Do you remember Hyo-jin Moon?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.945
Suspicious, right?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.073
I can't tell.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.575
What do you mean?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.912
He flinched as soon as I asked
if he knew Hyo-jin Moon. Watch again.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.207
Do you remember Hyo-jin Moon?

13:14.668 --> 13:16.337
Her dad had passed away...

13:16.420 --> 13:17.755
It may be in your head.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.256
...restaurant.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.216
Why you...

13:21.634 --> 13:22.551
Look.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.722
Dad, I'm leaving.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.932
Then what's this?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.060
I know how frustrated you are,

13:31.435 --> 13:33.062
but this isn't enough.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.980
I have my memory.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.732
Memories can be distorted.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.362
Are you saying I manipulated my memory
to make myself feel better?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.197
We need objective proof.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.081
FIND A TEACHER

13:52.706 --> 13:53.791
Gwan-young Han

13:55.292 --> 13:58.712
CHUNGCHEONGNAM-DO OFFICE OF EDUCATION
GWAN-YOUNG HAN

14:03.926 --> 14:06.971
RESEARCH WORK: DONATION FOR EDUCATION
VIA PERSONALIZED FIELD ACTIVITIES

14:43.841 --> 14:45.593
This doesn't get recycled, right?

14:46.176 --> 14:47.595
Are you throwing it away?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.889
You have to put it in a garbage bag.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.557
A garbage bag?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.684
You'll end up throwing it away anyway.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.687
Sure. I know that, but...

14:58.647 --> 15:00.274
I wish there were a service

15:00.357 --> 15:03.027
that would keep things for me for a while
and throw them away later.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.738
Like a memory preservation service.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.617
-Are you going out?
-Yes.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.286
-What is that?
-Apple jam.

15:13.120 --> 15:13.954
It's hot.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.333
Don't take anything from Jang-hoon
that's too big.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.543
What's the standard of "big"?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.629
A shoebox.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.381
If it's bigger than a shoebox,
it'll be a pain to get rid of later.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.218
She just scoffed at me, right?

15:28.552 --> 15:32.556
She thinks her love will last forever.
She'll think it won't ever change.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.476
You think you're an exception, right?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.605
That's how she was last year,
and so was I before.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.025
-What?
-Something smells incredible...

15:46.111 --> 15:47.446
General Cho.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.993
My General Cho
turned into a female general.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.204
That's why you're freaking out?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.206
See you later.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.375
Bye.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.961
-You saw her in a dress before.
-When?

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
When we went apple picking.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.798
She wore my mom's dress.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.715
She did?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.678
I know you were in a dark stage,
but that's too much.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.014
Where is she going, dressed like that?
That's hot.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.392
Probably to see the landlord.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.851
Jang-hoon? Why?

16:24.191 --> 16:25.067
Stop.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.409
-What brings you here?
-Just.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.632
One of my housemates

16:49.299 --> 16:51.635
broke up with her boyfriend recently.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.348
Actually, it ended a few months ago,

16:57.558 --> 17:01.103
but she finally let go recently,
and asked him to break up.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.481
So, the housemates threw her a party.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.483
What about it?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.902
That's all.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.327
If you get to that point too,
I'll throw you a party.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.626
I didn't understand a word you said.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.129
They don't look good.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.300
Those shoes.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.596
They don't go with the dress.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.737
Wow. That's really nice.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.156
-Who is that?
-Eun.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.700
I see. It's Eun.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.123
It's Eun.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.167
Hi. You came.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.545
You're wearing a skirt.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
You look really pretty. Like a princess.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.222
Why are you laughing?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.350
I'm just...

18:23.185 --> 18:24.728
Why are you still in the hospital?

18:26.605 --> 18:30.984
I wanted to get a thorough checkup
while I'm here.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.822
Quit smoking and exercise a little.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.992
Look at that belly.
And you faint in front of the kid...

18:39.910 --> 18:40.828
You're right.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.414
How's school? Is it okay?

18:46.041 --> 18:46.875
Yes.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.461
How do you like living on your own?

18:49.795 --> 18:52.089
It's not like I'm living by myself.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.383
Then what is it?

18:55.008 --> 18:56.468
It's a share-house.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.680
It's not bad.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.516
Do you have a boyfriend?

19:04.351 --> 19:05.811
I'm leaving.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.772
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

19:08.939 --> 19:09.773
Already?

19:13.861 --> 19:16.113
She cried the other day.

19:17.364 --> 19:21.451
-Why?
-I said I disliked my hair, and she cried.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.412
I was so surprised.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.747
What do you mean?

19:26.331 --> 19:29.835
Seriously. I'll tell you slowly,
so listen carefully, okay?

19:30.043 --> 19:30.878
Okay.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.796
The other day,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.424
-Yes.
-I said I didn't like my hair,

19:35.507 --> 19:37.426
-Yes.
-and she cried.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.805
So, why did she cry
when you didn't like your hair?

19:54.693 --> 19:55.652
Where did you go?

20:00.782 --> 20:03.785
What's this? Whom did you see
dressed like that?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.747
-Just.
-Why you...

20:07.456 --> 20:09.875
If you get dolled up, show it to me first.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.922
Give me a spin.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.514
Come here.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.141
Seriously.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.485
-Put your face closer.
-What?

20:53.794 --> 20:54.836
I forgot something.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.591
I forgot something, but what was it?
I forgot.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.260
What was it? Shoot.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.231
I should have gotten the set.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.694
Your mother is 80 years old.
I have never seen her wear earrings.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.281
A gift isn't necessarily for her to wear.
It's the thought that counts.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.867
Yes. But must you show off like that?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.662
I don't want to be compared to my sister.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.622
It needs to be at least similar.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.801
Put on a different lipstick.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.137
Okay.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.474
-We're here.
-Hello.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.933
Hi.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.185
Come in.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.312
-You look good.
-How have you been?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.106
-When did you get in?
-Yesterday.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.858
-Hi, Ye-eun.
-How have you been?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.069
I hear you're busy with your thesis.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.653
I barely submitted it.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.322
-Sit down.
-Long time no see.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.034
-You're looking good.
-You look good, Mom.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.164
I heard you took time off.
Why? Did something happen?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.792
Of course, not.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.212
She was taking classes
and getting experience here and there.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.381
It's so hard to get a job,

23:03.465 --> 23:06.593
that it's normal to take time off
to build up their resume.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.888
Do people in your department
get jobs well?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.516
Regardless, she's a science major.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.310
It's good she chose that
back when she was in high school.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.771
If she chose liberal arts as she wanted,
where would she be?

23:17.854 --> 23:18.730
Right?

23:19.314 --> 23:20.774
You've gotten prettier.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.651
Do you have a boyfriend?

23:22.943 --> 23:26.196
She doesn't know about things like that.
She's too naive.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.658
When she graduates and gets a job,

23:29.741 --> 23:31.743
introduce her to someone nice
at your company.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.411
Okay, fine. I will.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.254
Happy birthday to you

23:42.337 --> 23:46.341
Happy birthday to you

23:46.424 --> 23:50.387
Happy birthday, dear Grandma

23:50.512 --> 23:54.141
-Happy birthday to you
-Thank you.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.767
Happy birthday.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.646
Happy birthday, Grandma.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.773
Happy birthday, Mom.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.694
Happy birthday, Mom.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.904
Happy birthday, Mother.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.322
Thank you.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.825
Mom, this is something nice.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.910
Thank you, my dear daughter.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.803
-Why aren't you eating?
-I am.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.224
You have lost weight.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.895
She did not. Young kids these days...

24:39.978 --> 24:41.646
I didn't ask you.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.983
Are you eating well?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.652
Yes, Grandma. I am.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.404
Is school fun?

24:49.487 --> 24:52.032
Of course. School is good.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.663
Good. As long as everything is okay.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.482
-Whose milk is that in the fridge?
-It isn't mine.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.567
-Not mine either.
-It's probably Ye-eun's.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.945
It expires today. May I drink it?

26:12.028 --> 26:13.280
I think so.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.992
Ye-eun went to a family dinner.
She'll be eating expensive food.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.744
Madame Jung, bring us leftovers.

26:19.869 --> 26:20.870
Please.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.484
Actually, the truth is,

26:53.236 --> 26:56.239
-the reason I took time off...
-Ye-eun.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.746
It wasn't to gain experience
and build up my resume.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.336
Uncle.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.921
I had a boyfriend.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.841
We had dated for three years.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.095
You know. You see it in the news at times.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.598
Dating violence.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.772
That's what happened to me.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.442
What are you talking...

27:32.525 --> 27:35.653
So I took time off from school
and underwent therapy.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.783
I'm not completely better yet,

27:40.408 --> 27:41.534
but still...

27:42.660 --> 27:44.537
I have gotten a lot better.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.708
-You're back.
-How was it?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.168
Hi, Ye-eun.

29:18.798 --> 29:19.966
Come on.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.052
Yes, that's it.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.639
-Got it.
-Stop it.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.771
What's wrong?

29:34.147 --> 29:35.064
Nothing.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.861
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

29:40.403 --> 29:41.988
Didn't you go to a Chinese restaurant?

29:42.572 --> 29:44.115
Didn't you have a full course?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.326
Yes, I did eat, but...

29:47.535 --> 29:49.204
You'll gain weight.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.207
So be it.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.710
Who wants to eat with me?

29:55.877 --> 29:56.795
-Me.
-Me.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.006
Did you find anything?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.550
No. Only stories of praise.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.553
He must've been such a great teacher.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.348
His students insisted on throwing him
an appreciation banquet.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.434
This is bad.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.613
Seosan Elementary School - Retired

30:28.743 --> 30:30.662
EXHIBITIONS

30:30.745 --> 30:31.746
ASSOCIATIONS

30:56.771 --> 30:57.939
You sing well.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.566
I was a singer.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.527
Jin-myung.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.071
I'm going back home next week.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.282
-Next week?
-Yes.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.075
You're sad, right?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.913
-Let's all have dinner together first.
-Okay.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.915
Your treat.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.417
Okay.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.628
Let's all eat together...

31:21.671 --> 31:23.172
and have a farewell show.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.425
A farewell show?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.844
Yes. One last time.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.477
A farewell show?

31:45.194 --> 31:46.070
Just a minute.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.328
-Thank you.
-Sorry?

31:53.411 --> 31:55.288
We heard from Heimdallr.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.916
-I'll go ahead.
-Okay.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.921
The truth is, we felt bad
that only we were kept

32:03.713 --> 32:04.964
after we disbanded.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.216
We felt too bad to call the others, too.

32:08.384 --> 32:11.804
Heimdallr called earlier and told us
you're giving us a farewell show.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.390
Oh, that? That's...

32:14.974 --> 32:15.808
Thank you.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.231
Jin-myung.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.098
CLEAR PAPER JAMS

32:58.476 --> 32:59.394
Jin-myung!

33:00.144 --> 33:01.771
Yes? Just a minute!

33:11.698 --> 33:12.824
Jin-myung!

33:13.199 --> 33:14.993
Yes! Just a minute!

33:35.680 --> 33:36.848
-What!
-What!

33:46.357 --> 33:48.276
You're so awesome!

34:01.164 --> 34:03.499
This is heaven on earth.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.045
What are they doing?

34:07.628 --> 34:10.840
I don't know. They were doing this
when I got home.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.974
That was great.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.643
-Thank you.
-Drink this! It's nice and cold.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.770
Drink this.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.771
Thank you.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.355
-You're sweating.
-Thank you.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.024
You were so cool.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.443
It's okay. You could take it off.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.779
I want to wipe your sweat for you.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.864
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

34:34.947 --> 34:37.533
Practicing. We need to practice
before going on stage.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.202
What?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.704
Don't worry.
The agency gave their approval.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.206
Guys. Say hi.

34:43.956 --> 34:44.916
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:45.917 --> 34:46.959
Thank you.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.046
I was really upset at how it ended.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.964
Don't be lame.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.217
Thank you.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.970
A farewell performance.
I never even dreamed of that.

34:58.554 --> 34:59.764
Thank you.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.808
-Thank you.
-We'll do our best.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.604
Also, I'm sorry for cursing at you
that time.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.818
-Okay, come on. Let's rehearse.
-Okay.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.820
Let's make it Asgard's best performance!

35:14.487 --> 35:15.530
-Okay.
-The best!

35:15.613 --> 35:16.531
The best.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.575
-Don't do this.
-Why not?

35:22.328 --> 35:23.955
I guess it is late.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.456
What do we do?

35:27.083 --> 35:28.918
You can use my living room. Come in.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.545
-Really?
-Really? May we?

35:30.628 --> 35:32.255
It isn't big, but it isn't small.

35:32.338 --> 35:34.340
-Is it really okay?
-Thank you.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.342
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.678
Go in! Don't be shy! Go in!

35:38.761 --> 35:41.597
Go in. Let's go in together.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.851
Where are you going? Come here.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.311
-That way. I need to go...
-Okay.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.939
-We'll see them later.
-I want to go that way.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.400
-Come on. Let's go.
-That way.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.403
-Come on.
-There are so many men.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.654
Goodness.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.489
Karaoke?

35:59.782 --> 36:00.867
Yes.

36:00.950 --> 36:05.830
I meant let's all go out for dinner
and go to karaoke or something.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.925
I don't think karaoke will cut it.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.261
-It won't.
-It won't.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.554
Definitely not.

36:22.763 --> 36:23.931
What do we do?

36:24.015 --> 36:27.685
What can we do?
They're all really looking forward to it.

36:27.768 --> 36:29.896
Shouldn't we tell them right away?

36:30.271 --> 36:33.316
It'll get harder and harder to tell them,
the longer we wait.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.861
Asgard.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.656
-Good work.
-Good work.

36:40.823 --> 36:43.034
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Eat breakfast.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.411
-I'm tired.
-By 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.704
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.084
Jin-myung.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.757
I need to talk to you.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.800
I'm sorry,

37:00.384 --> 37:03.721
but the farewell show I mentioned
isn't quite what you're thinking.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.556
I just meant we could...

37:07.391 --> 37:08.976
Do you think I'm stupid?

37:09.560 --> 37:12.021
Do you think I expected a concert hall?

37:13.814 --> 37:18.819
It's okay even if it's small.
We just need a stage and a mic.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.198
"This is Asgard. This is our end."

37:22.281 --> 37:24.617
As long as we can announce that together.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.973
A stage and a mic?

37:48.641 --> 37:50.101
At least five million won?

37:50.893 --> 37:54.146
What? Five million won?
Why is it so expensive?

37:54.772 --> 37:57.441
You have to rent the amps, lights...

37:57.942 --> 38:00.236
That's just for the basics.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.117
Community centers are cheaper.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.246
They're booked for two months.

38:22.174 --> 38:23.175
Have a nice day.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.011
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.401
What is it?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.403
I'm sorry for lying.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.741
I'm sorry too, for being a nag.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.535
Are you mad at me?

38:50.786 --> 38:51.620
No.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.124
Are you busy this weekend?

38:56.250 --> 38:57.501
I don't know.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.462
Do you want to watch a cartoon?

39:02.423 --> 39:04.717
I'm tired. I'm going to stay home.

39:16.854 --> 39:17.897
What's up?

39:21.317 --> 39:22.193
Is something wrong?

39:24.236 --> 39:25.529
Where's Heimdallr?

39:25.738 --> 39:26.906
He went to meet a friend.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.867
Then may I come in?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.663
Sure. Come in.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.028
Ye-ji...

40:11.951 --> 40:13.035
What did she say?

40:14.495 --> 40:15.746
She won't do anything.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.707
We've just drifted apart.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.964
She's a million times more distant
than when she screams and cries.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.510
When you were little,

40:30.052 --> 40:32.054
did you make a vow
that only the two of you

40:32.805 --> 40:34.140
would be friends?

40:37.059 --> 40:37.893
You did.

40:40.729 --> 40:43.357
Back then, I didn't need anyone else
and still had fun.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.489
We were friends for 12 years.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.742
Wow, 12 years...

40:54.743 --> 40:57.204
It must be worse than breaking up
after dating.

40:59.081 --> 41:01.917
I was annoyed because she was so clingy,

41:03.252 --> 41:05.337
but now I'm annoyed
because she's so distant.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.929
I'm terrible, aren't I?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.723
Everyone's like that.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.647
You want a drink?

41:51.175 --> 41:53.886
Here's to your 12-year-long friendship.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.777
No relationship lasts forever.

42:12.279 --> 42:13.489
And your relationship...

42:14.698 --> 42:16.492
was too exclusive.

42:17.826 --> 42:20.246
Whether love or friendship,
if you do that...

42:29.838 --> 42:30.756
Then what?

42:32.675 --> 42:35.344
It gets too tough. It's so tough.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.013
You're right.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.482
You know...

42:50.234 --> 42:52.152
when I told my friends
that I got a girlfriend,

42:53.237 --> 42:55.197
they said I should

42:55.281 --> 42:58.742
take you somewhere
and get it done before I join the army.

43:01.829 --> 43:04.957
I used to make stupid jokes like that
without thinking in the past too.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.460
But I didn't like hearing it.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.089
I don't want you...

43:13.757 --> 43:18.554
to question if that's what I was after
after I join the army.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.142
Do you understand?

43:26.478 --> 43:31.025
You may say what's the big deal
about going to the army,

43:31.984 --> 43:33.694
but in my position...

43:35.362 --> 43:37.239
Stop scratching. What's wrong with you?

43:38.699 --> 43:39.825
It's itchy.

43:40.492 --> 43:41.952
I feel sick, too.

43:46.206 --> 43:47.207
Can you not drink?

43:50.878 --> 43:52.296
My head hurts.

43:52.379 --> 43:53.922
-What's going on?
-Hey.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.133
-General Cho!
-Oh my gosh.

43:56.216 --> 43:58.052
-There.
-Careful.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.596
-Careful.
-Be careful.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.474
Get up.

44:03.557 --> 44:06.185
Hey! How much did you make her drink?

44:06.477 --> 44:08.187
-Well...
-Three bottles?

44:08.270 --> 44:10.648
No! Three sips. I swear.
It was three sips.

44:10.731 --> 44:11.899
Is something wrong?

44:14.693 --> 44:16.487
Ye-ji and I broke up.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.575
We decided to break up.

44:27.289 --> 44:30.125
Maybe we broke up long ago.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.420
But this time, it's definitely the end.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.506
What? That's it?

44:37.341 --> 44:38.175
Yes.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.052
That's all.

44:42.971 --> 44:46.183
Other people don't know
what kind of a relationship we had.

44:48.477 --> 44:49.478
You know,

44:49.978 --> 44:53.941
I knew Ye-ji for two-thirds of my life.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.029
I was closer to her than to my parents.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.660
Ye-ji was once my entire life.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.582
So tell me,

45:11.041 --> 45:12.918
am I supposed to be sad or not sad?

45:14.503 --> 45:16.422
Sad. You're sad.

45:16.505 --> 45:18.132
Yes. It's natural to be sad.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.925
So, let's go in.

45:20.008 --> 45:22.511
-Let's go in and sleep.
-Let's sleep.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.179
Let's go.

45:24.263 --> 45:25.889
You're so mean!

45:27.057 --> 45:28.100
Why do you discriminate?

45:28.809 --> 45:29.643
What?

45:30.185 --> 45:32.187
When Eun-jae was dumped,

45:32.688 --> 45:36.024
you popped party poppers
and threw her a party and stuff.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.861
Why don't you do it for me?

45:42.406 --> 45:43.407
I want one, too.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.286
Do we have any poppers?

45:48.787 --> 45:49.621
Yes.

45:51.165 --> 45:51.999
Get them.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.876
That's so tacky...

45:59.506 --> 46:01.884
-Let's take two each.
-Okay.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.846
Ready? Okay.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.850
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

46:12.019 --> 46:12.895
Congratulations!

46:14.730 --> 46:16.231
Congratulations!

46:16.398 --> 46:17.649
-Good night.
-Good night.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.818
-Good night.
-Good night.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.739
When she gets drunk...

46:23.906 --> 46:25.073
She's super cute, right?

46:28.202 --> 46:29.036
Here.

46:29.745 --> 46:30.579
Good night.

46:31.330 --> 46:32.164
Later.

46:56.271 --> 46:57.940
I never saw Eun drunk before.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.359
I thought she would be a heavy drinker.

47:00.776 --> 47:01.818
I know, right?

47:15.332 --> 47:17.918
INVITATION

47:19.294 --> 47:22.589
You are invited to Gwan-young Han's
appreciation banquet.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.641
Hello?

47:33.308 --> 47:34.935
Hello. Well...

47:35.477 --> 47:38.146
I'm calling about Gwan-young Han's
appreciation banquet.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.064
Yes?

47:40.399 --> 47:42.150
My name is Ji-won Song.

47:42.734 --> 47:45.862
I received an invitation,

47:46.488 --> 47:48.991
and I wondered how you knew my address.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.576
Just a minute.

47:51.493 --> 47:55.205
FIND: Ji-won Song

47:55.289 --> 47:57.874
JI-WON SONG: GANAE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 2007

47:58.584 --> 48:00.961
You wrote it down
when you came by last time.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.879
Last time?

48:03.505 --> 48:06.008
Yes, when you came in the spring.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.429
In the spring?

48:11.221 --> 48:12.347
On March 2.

48:12.848 --> 48:14.975
The banquet got delayed
from the initial date.

48:15.058 --> 48:19.521
We had planned it for May,
but my dad kept refusing, so...

48:21.690 --> 48:22.524
Hello?

48:24.318 --> 48:26.778
Yes. Yes, I understand.

48:28.238 --> 48:29.448
Thank you.

48:42.628 --> 48:43.462
What's up?

48:44.421 --> 48:47.424
-Where's Heimdallr?
-He isn't back yet.

48:49.676 --> 48:52.095
He said he was going to get costumes
for their performance.

48:54.973 --> 48:56.183
Okay.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.018
Would you like some tea?

48:58.393 --> 49:00.312
-No, I'm good.
-Okay.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.121
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.833
Did you tell Heimdallr?

49:22.417 --> 49:23.460
Not yet.

49:23.877 --> 49:26.713
Don't tell him yet.
I think we may figure something out.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.341
-How?
-I'll tell you later!

49:40.060 --> 49:42.104
MAILBOX

49:50.404 --> 49:51.405
What are you doing?

50:00.831 --> 50:02.249
I asked what you are doing.

50:04.751 --> 50:05.836
Well...

50:14.970 --> 50:17.514
Did an invitation come in the mail?

50:17.889 --> 50:19.391
For Hyo-jin...

50:42.038 --> 50:43.206
Is this it?

50:49.796 --> 50:51.256
TO: HYO-JIN MOON

50:56.178 --> 50:57.429
How did you know she got this?

50:58.805 --> 51:00.766
-What?
-Did you get one, too?

51:04.311 --> 51:06.521
-Well...
-Who's Gwan-young Han?

51:07.814 --> 51:10.525
He was your teacher
during third grade, wasn't he?

51:14.029 --> 51:15.947
It wasn't you, but Gwan-young Han

51:16.865 --> 51:18.617
who ruined Hyo-jin's life.

51:23.830 --> 51:25.582
Hold on. Where are you going?

51:54.110 --> 51:55.153
Who are you?

51:56.863 --> 51:58.198
I'm here to stop you.

51:58.990 --> 51:59.991
Who told you?

52:00.742 --> 52:01.743
Ji-won?

52:04.871 --> 52:06.748
God... Get lost!

52:18.426 --> 52:19.469
I may kill you.

52:27.853 --> 52:30.146
-What do you plan to do?
-I'll kill that bastard.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.898
-You can't.
-Why not?

52:31.982 --> 52:35.318
Because that isn't what Hyo-jin wanted.

52:35.443 --> 52:36.736
How do you know?

52:38.071 --> 52:39.447
Because she put my name down.

52:40.282 --> 52:43.869
Because she wanted to go
to the banquet with me.

52:46.621 --> 52:49.916
Hyo-jin wanted me to be there.

52:50.500 --> 52:53.670
She wanted me to be there
when she confronted Gwan-young Han.

52:55.463 --> 52:57.007
Then you do what you want.

52:57.507 --> 52:58.758
I'll do it my way.

52:58.925 --> 53:02.262
If you do it your way,
I can't do what I planned.

53:02.929 --> 53:06.099
If I can't do what I planned,
we can't do what Hyo-jin wanted.

53:07.309 --> 53:09.477
Don't you think I thought of that?

53:10.562 --> 53:12.105
I thought of coming here

53:12.355 --> 53:14.733
in the middle of the night
and smashing his head in.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.903
Or even breaking into his house
with a knife.

53:19.529 --> 53:21.323
I thought of them, too.

53:22.157 --> 53:26.077
I'm sure that if I thought of them,
so did she.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.039
But she didn't do it. Why not?

53:30.707 --> 53:32.250
Because that isn't it.

53:32.959 --> 53:36.838
Because that isn't what Hyo-jin wanted.

53:39.633 --> 53:41.217
She planned to go...

53:42.218 --> 53:44.220
to the banquet with me.

53:46.181 --> 53:49.225
I don't know why she died
before then, but...

53:51.269 --> 53:52.979
now, I must do it alone.

53:54.105 --> 53:55.440
So, I'm going to do it.

54:09.579 --> 54:10.580
Do it right, then.

54:22.342 --> 54:23.176
What are you doing?

54:23.593 --> 54:25.595
I heard noises outside.

54:26.471 --> 54:27.555
Where's Bi-joo?

54:28.306 --> 54:29.766
She finally fell asleep.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.394
She hates to sleep.
I wonder who she takes after.

54:32.477 --> 54:34.604
Who else? She gets it from you.

54:35.146 --> 54:36.606
-Me?
-Definitely.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.109
Once you got on my back,
you wouldn't get off.

54:39.526 --> 54:40.735
No way.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.612
-Good night.
-You, too.

54:55.458 --> 54:56.292
Does it hurt?

54:58.003 --> 54:58.837
Why?

54:59.129 --> 55:00.171
Does it hurt you, too?

55:05.343 --> 55:07.303
Nothing's gone right since I met you.

55:09.723 --> 55:10.682
I'm sorry.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.227
You were the only person I could ask.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.275
But it's almost over.

55:21.359 --> 55:22.485
What do you plan to do?

55:24.988 --> 55:28.158
I must do what Hyo-jin planned to do.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.329
Will you be okay?

55:36.249 --> 55:39.794
Even if I won't be, I will do it anyway.
I have no choice.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.096
Don't worry.

55:52.515 --> 55:53.349
Sorry.

56:11.701 --> 56:13.536
TO: HYO-JIN MOON

56:13.620 --> 56:16.456
TO: JI-WON SONG

56:18.458 --> 56:23.713
FROM: NAN-HO HAN

56:43.149 --> 56:43.983
Let's go.

56:48.655 --> 56:52.700
What kind of a life
did that child dream of back then?

56:53.576 --> 56:57.747
Did she want an average life
or did she want to be special?

56:59.082 --> 57:00.708
Did she dream of adventure?

57:01.584 --> 57:03.294
Did she dream of love?

57:05.004 --> 57:08.133
I mourn for her way too late.

57:09.843 --> 57:13.513
I mourn for her dreams that were wasted.

57:15.515 --> 57:19.936
I couldn't remember nor forget.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.231
My friend Hyo-jin Moon.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.287
Today, I pray for them

57:38.413 --> 57:40.832
that they may not face any storms,

57:41.749 --> 57:45.503
that they may not experience things
they can't do anything about,

57:47.464 --> 57:49.591
that even if they get bored
and frustrated,

57:50.258 --> 57:52.051
they may live average lives.

57:54.804 --> 57:56.514
And I also pray...

57:58.725 --> 58:01.144
that if they experience something
they can't do anything about,

58:01.686 --> 58:02.812
they may overcome it.

58:04.772 --> 58:08.568
I pray that even if they're afraid,
they may still go forward.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.287
Hyo-jin Moon

58:19.370 --> 58:20.997
I pray that they may give all they have

58:21.623 --> 58:23.416
to become the person...

58:24.792 --> 58:26.127
they wanted to become back then.

58:26.211 --> 58:30.882
Ji-won Song

58:35.637 --> 58:39.974
HYO-JIN MOON, JI-WON SONG

59:04.249 --> 59:05.124
You don't want to go?

59:05.208 --> 59:07.710
You don't know how a guy
going to the army feels.

59:07.794 --> 59:09.587
-Who is that?
-My girlfriend.

59:09.671 --> 59:11.214
-Hello.
-Come in.

59:11.297 --> 59:13.174
Ho-chang. Your sisters must be here.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.134
-Ho-chang!
-Ho-chang!

59:15.218 --> 59:16.302
Hello.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.012
-I can't do it.
-Shut it!

59:18.096 --> 59:20.181
Who cares if you mess up?
Sing your heart out.

59:20.265 --> 59:21.391
Jin-myung Yoon!

59:22.684 --> 59:24.602
-How may we help you?
-Ji-won Song...

59:24.686 --> 59:27.355
You saw Choong-hwan today, right?
He said you changed a lot.

59:27.438 --> 59:28.773
Date him. He's a nice guy.

59:28.856 --> 59:30.900
He apparently looked you up.

59:30.984 --> 59:34.821
-You should stop her from going to jail.
-You should have told me...

59:34.904 --> 59:35.947
You would have stopped me.

59:36.030 --> 59:39.659
Are you 100% sure?
You don't have even 1% of doubt?

59:40.159 --> 59:42.787
I won't apologize. I can't apologize.

59:50.503 --> 59:52.797
8 YEARS LATER

59:57.677 --> 1:00:00.638
WHY AN APPLE OF ALL THINGS?

1:00:02.348 --> 1:00:04.684
SINGLE EYELIDS?

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.104
PINK?

1:00:09.355 --> 1:00:11.399
VERY LONG LEGS?

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:16.613
Let's go.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:25.622
Is this the house where Mom used to live?

1:00:27.373 --> 1:00:28.207
Yes.

1:00:33.713 --> 1:00:36.174
