WEBVTT

00:13.540 --> 00:15.380
I'll take you as
far as the broad,

00:15.380 --> 00:17.980
then I've got to go see
my mum's lawyer.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.860
I know, you already said.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.220
No.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.460
Definitely not.

00:28.580 --> 00:29.860
Oh, yes.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.220
What do you think?

00:34.220 --> 00:35.340
No capes, Lyra.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.660
"No capes."
Eh, what does he know?

00:41.940 --> 00:43.420
Or hats.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.940
The point is to blend in.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.780
Is this good enough for you, Pan?

00:51.780 --> 00:53.100
You can't put Pan in that.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.220
Lyra, people are going to
be looking for me.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.540
Bad people, the police.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.940
You mustn't look different
or you'll draw attention to us.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.340
They'll start asking questions.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.100
They'll find this window
and everything.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.380
This is a good hiding place.

01:05.380 --> 01:09.180
I'm safer here,
so let's keep it that way.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.500
Lyra?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.820
Sorry, Pan. Unbelievable.

01:17.020 --> 01:19.460
It stinks of old goat!

01:28.300 --> 01:32.380
You're sure you remember
where this is? This is the gate.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.300
I can see it, Will.

01:44.140 --> 01:45.740
Lyra, wait!

01:45.740 --> 01:47.020
Wait!

01:53.820 --> 01:55.580
Are you OK?

01:56.820 --> 01:59.740
Yeah. They don't have cars
that fast in my Oxford.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.420
You don't have the word
"wait" either?

02:01.420 --> 02:03.580
Come on, get up.

02:03.580 --> 02:05.420
This way.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.700
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.980
Is this similar to your Oxford?

02:18.300 --> 02:19.580
I guess.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.220
Sort of.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.860
We need to be careful.
Blend in.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.540
Sorry.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.220
Would you like a picture?

04:30.220 --> 04:31.620
Oh, look at that guy!

04:37.100 --> 04:38.580
Come on.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.740
Mind out! Oh!

04:39.740 --> 04:40.780
Lyra.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.380
Wait, that building's close
to Jordan in my world.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.540
Lyra, slow down!

04:50.860 --> 04:52.460
I've never heard of Jordan College.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.140
The tower's right there -
it's right next to it!

05:08.460 --> 05:10.660
Oh! So sorry, so sorry.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.540
Further back that way.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.580
What's the matter?

05:26.580 --> 05:29.980
You were right - Jordan College
doesn't exist in your world.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.940
This isn't like our Oxford at all.

05:34.380 --> 05:35.820
Come on.

05:57.740 --> 06:01.820
Your Eminences,
venerable brothers,

06:01.820 --> 06:05.420
I will not use this solemn day

06:05.420 --> 06:09.140
to tell of the wildness
of the witch

06:09.140 --> 06:13.820
whom I saw strike our
brother Sturrock down.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.420
But have no fear.

06:17.820 --> 06:22.540
She and her kind
will be brought to account.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.100
As acting cardinal...

06:25.660 --> 06:27.700
..of this Magisterium,

06:27.700 --> 06:30.860
I have a duty to tell you

06:30.860 --> 06:34.260
that these troubled times

06:34.260 --> 06:38.100
call for strong,
decisive leadership.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.980
And the Authority has blessed me

06:41.980 --> 06:43.900
with a clarity of purpose

06:43.900 --> 06:47.060
which cuts through my grief...

06:48.060 --> 06:49.300
..like a knife!

06:51.420 --> 06:53.220
In deepest respect,

06:53.220 --> 06:55.900
I dedicate myself...

06:57.740 --> 07:00.260
..to this great task.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.260
That's nothing.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.140
One time, I fell off a tree,

07:10.140 --> 07:12.420
and the librarian thought
I'd broken my leg.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.780
So he carried me all the way

07:13.780 --> 07:15.900
from the Botanic Gardens
back to Jordan.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.820
We have the Botanic Gardens.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.380
My mum used to take me.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.340
Good as new.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.500
What's that thing, anyway? Why
do you keep looking at it?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.260
I just need to do something.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.060
What's it do?

07:47.220 --> 07:51.820
You phone people on it and it
tells you stuff, like the news.

07:53.060 --> 07:56.020
I have something a bit
like that, but better.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.540
Mm-hm.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.020
I asked it about you, Will.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.940
It told me you're a murderer.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.180
What?!

08:06.940 --> 08:08.860
I needed to know about you,
so I asked it.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.580
And it's fine - it's the
good kind of murderer, like...

08:11.580 --> 08:13.020
Stop saying that word.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.260
You don't know
what you're talking about.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.460
I had no choice.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.660
What's it saying?

08:27.660 --> 08:30.100
It's saying I need to see my mum.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.460
I have to make sure she's all right.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.380
Stay out of trouble, OK?

08:36.580 --> 08:39.780
I'll meet you at
the Botanic Gardens, 5pm.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.220
You shouldn't have
called him a murderer.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.340
This looks more like our Oxford.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.060
I do not like this place. Get in!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.540
Huh? Sh.

09:42.980 --> 09:47.620
Where do I find the scholar
to tell me about Dust?

09:52.140 --> 09:55.020
Keys - which saint held the keys?

09:55.020 --> 09:56.300
St Peter, wasn't it?

09:56.300 --> 09:58.260
So there must be a
St Peter's College.

10:00.740 --> 10:03.340
It's telling me to look for the
door with the mountain on it.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.220
It's saying...

10:08.220 --> 10:10.340
..not to lie to the scholar.

10:10.340 --> 10:13.100
How are you going to manage that?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.660
It's telling me to focus on the boy.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.220
To help him find his father.

10:19.220 --> 10:21.060
But...

10:21.060 --> 10:23.220
..I thought Will was supposed
to be helping us.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.260
We don't have much time.
Let's find the scholar first.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.460
OK.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.260
You're interested in skulls?

10:55.260 --> 10:56.580
Huh?

10:57.900 --> 10:59.900
Did you know...

10:59.900 --> 11:01.580
..that people still do that?

11:01.580 --> 11:03.340
Drill holes in their heads.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.660
They must be lunatics.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.260
There's a name for it.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.140
I've forgotten what it's called.
Trepanning.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.540
Are you a student in Oxford?

11:15.540 --> 11:18.060
No, it says it there.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.100
I wish I knew so much at your age.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.260
Charles.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.140
Lizzie.

11:29.740 --> 11:31.300
I'm a collector.

11:32.540 --> 11:36.220
I've donated various items
to this place.

11:36.220 --> 11:40.180
Listen, if you ever want to know
more about these artefacts...

11:42.020 --> 11:43.620
Thanks.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.820
Nice to meet you, Lizzie.

12:29.660 --> 12:30.940
You were right.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.700
Will texted me - he'll be in
touch soon.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.140
The head of
the Magisterium, Ruta?

12:48.140 --> 12:52.540
He was a bloated monster who spread
hate and fear and blindness.

12:52.540 --> 12:55.060
I had to send Dr Lanselius
as a peace envoy

12:55.060 --> 12:56.820
to clean up this mess.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.180
We can't get drawn into this
cycle of futile revenge.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.060
We must focus on the girl
and the prophecy.

13:03.060 --> 13:05.060
You speak as if you are above this.

13:05.060 --> 13:08.140
And you act as if you
have no self-control.

13:08.140 --> 13:09.540
I protected the prophecy.

13:09.540 --> 13:13.060
Thanks to me, our enemies still
don't know the child's name.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.900
We need to unite the nine clans.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.500
We've cut the head off
the Magisterium.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.620
So let's finish what they started.

13:22.420 --> 13:23.900
The world's changing.

13:25.060 --> 13:27.060
We've all sensed it.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.900
The skies are darkening.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.820
The light is dull.

13:34.380 --> 13:38.940
I'm trying to reach for the child,
but...she feels indistinct...

13:40.860 --> 13:42.300
..like she's behind a veil.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.660
If we cannot reach her,
all will be lost.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.180
This is it, St Peter's College.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.140
You mustn't go lying to
the scholar, remember that.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.500
Pan, I won't lie to him.
I can do that.

14:43.620 --> 14:44.660
Hi.

14:44.660 --> 14:48.260
Er, can you please tell me
where the physicist is?

14:48.260 --> 14:51.420
Well, what kind of physicist
are you after? Will I do?

14:51.420 --> 14:52.540
You're a scholar?

14:54.020 --> 14:55.940
Believe it or not, I am, yeah.

14:55.940 --> 14:58.060
What were you doing?

14:58.060 --> 14:59.820
Oh, I'm watching...

14:59.820 --> 15:02.620
There's a nest of fledglings
in the drain - wrens.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.460
They come back every year.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.340
Sorry, you are?

15:06.340 --> 15:07.660
Lyra Silvertongue.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.740
Mary Malone.
You're not a student, are you?

15:11.740 --> 15:13.380
Can you please tell me about Dust?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.620
Dust?

15:15.700 --> 15:17.380
What do you mean?

15:17.380 --> 15:19.740
Well, we call it Dust in my world,

15:19.740 --> 15:22.900
or we also call it Rusakov
particles - you ever heard of them?

15:22.900 --> 15:25.220
In your world...
In your school, you mean?

15:25.220 --> 15:26.340
No.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.260
We're not allowed to study Dust

15:28.260 --> 15:30.380
because the Magisterium
thinks it's original sin.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.820
They take children to the North,
and now there's an opening.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.300
And my father is...

15:37.140 --> 15:38.860
I'm saying it all wrong.

15:38.860 --> 15:40.980
I didn't think it would be
this difficult.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.780
I'm not sure I'm who you're
looking for, Lyra. Yes.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.300
Yes, you are.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.460
I know you are.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.060
Is there someone I can call to
help, your parents or...?

15:50.060 --> 15:51.220
No.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.980
This matters.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.340
This matters...

15:59.340 --> 16:00.460
..so much.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.460
You see, my friend was killed.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.700
Because of Dust.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.540
I've travelled so far.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.300
I found myself here.

16:16.420 --> 16:17.740
And Jordan's gone...

16:19.220 --> 16:20.620
..and I don't know where to go.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.340
I need to find out about Dust,

16:23.340 --> 16:24.940
because if I don't find
out about Dust,

16:24.940 --> 16:26.260
it will all be for nothing.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.020
Roger's death will be for nothing.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.900
I miss him so much.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.340
I'm sorry about your friend.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.380
I need you to tell me about
the particles you study.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.540
Please.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.020
OK.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.060
OK.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.820
Hmm.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.420
You missed the funeral.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.420
You know, I'm not sure you've
shown Cardinal Sturrock

17:13.420 --> 17:15.140
the respect he deserves.

17:15.140 --> 17:18.300
Will you help MacPhail
keep the top job?

17:18.300 --> 17:22.620
I vote this evening,
but he has stiff competition.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.740
Father Graves.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.860
I think you'd make a better
cardinal than either of them.

17:29.860 --> 17:32.020
Graves is on quite the crusade.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.100
He's arrested half the North,

17:34.100 --> 17:36.740
and the council seem rather pleased.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.180
I saw they're holding

17:39.180 --> 17:42.260
that manservant of Asriel's
down in the basement.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.380
Any sign of the man himself?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.460
Uh-uh. Not a trace.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.540
Where have you been hiding?

17:58.500 --> 17:59.540
Away.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.020
On business.

18:03.820 --> 18:04.980
And you?

18:04.980 --> 18:07.420
How is that charming
daughter of yours?

18:09.100 --> 18:10.740
The escape artist.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.980
They grow up so fast.

18:15.980 --> 18:18.460
Has her daemon settled yet?

18:18.460 --> 18:20.820
My daughter is
none of your business.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.900
You are Dr Martin Lanselius,

18:38.900 --> 18:41.420
consul to the witches of the North,

18:41.420 --> 18:44.940
and you claim to have been
sent here as a peace envoy.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.180
Is that correct?

18:46.180 --> 18:52.740
Appointed by Queen Serafina Pekkala
to reaffirm the mutual tolerance

18:52.740 --> 18:54.540
between our cultures.

18:54.540 --> 18:58.780
I was sorry to hear
of the cardinal's death,

18:58.780 --> 19:00.340
but that witch acted alone.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.620
We have grounds to believe
you are here as a spy.

19:03.620 --> 19:07.780
Do you deny that the witches
have been conspiring

19:07.780 --> 19:09.780
against the Magisterium

19:09.780 --> 19:11.700
with the heretic Asriel,

19:11.700 --> 19:14.860
and you are here to gain
intelligence?

19:14.860 --> 19:16.220
Absolutely.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.060
To side in human conflict
is against their nature.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.980
You will find no evidence
of conspiracy because...

19:23.180 --> 19:24.500
..there is none.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.620
I am here to offer our deep
regret and broker peace.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.420
That is all.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.140
May I question the prisoner?

19:37.820 --> 19:43.100
Dr Lanselius, you are the son of
a witch, born out of wedlock.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.940
This witch, did she raise you?

19:44.940 --> 19:47.340
I spent my childhood in the lakes,

19:47.340 --> 19:49.260
then, as is the tradition...

19:50.780 --> 19:53.780
..when my daemon settled,
I left home. Ah.

19:55.860 --> 20:00.100
What sort of a mother
would send her child away?

20:00.100 --> 20:03.860
Is this not all a perversion
of all that is natural?

20:05.220 --> 20:09.460
She sent me to my father to spare me
the pain of the daemon ritual.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.340
A barbaric practice.

20:11.340 --> 20:15.380
No, the ritual is beautiful.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.860
There is a region
in the furthest North

20:17.860 --> 20:19.500
where daemons cannot go.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.620
To become a witch, a girl
must cross it alone.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.820
It allows separation
without breaking the soul.

20:25.820 --> 20:29.460
Witches have been hiding the power
of daemon separation for centuries.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.140
Rituals aren't a secret.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.340
The witches have no
quarrel with you.

20:33.340 --> 20:36.260
Witches are the enemies of men.

20:36.260 --> 20:39.620
They use their soft,
deceitful ways to seduce us.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.900
They steal men's seed and then
they abandon their offspring.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.020
Well, then, you have
misunderstood them.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.580
Oh, please, enlighten me.
Witches see...

20:49.900 --> 20:52.260
..the mysteries and beauty
of this planet

20:52.260 --> 20:55.140
in ways that men cannot see.
Blasphemy!

20:55.140 --> 20:57.340
Did you hear that? Blasphemy!

21:05.900 --> 21:07.340
Thank you, Father Graves.

21:12.860 --> 21:16.420
Only the Authority can know
the mysteries of this world.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.500
All rise.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.540
Dr Lanselius...

21:28.300 --> 21:31.580
..you are hereby condemned
as a traitor.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.780
By Magisterium decree,

21:33.780 --> 21:36.660
on the charges of heresy,
collusion and conspiracy,

21:36.660 --> 21:39.580
you are sentenced to
eight years' hard labour

21:39.580 --> 21:41.140
and daemon captivity.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.500
Take him downstairs.

21:52.580 --> 21:57.460
Next detainee to be called,
number 1584.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.580
Thank you.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.780
Please.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.100
Thank you for seeing me.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.500
I'm Will Parry,
Elaine and John Parry's son.

22:18.660 --> 22:21.460
In this letter he wrote to my mum,

22:21.460 --> 22:24.740
he said if there was ever any
trouble, she should contact you.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.140
I expect he was talking about the
trust I helped him set up.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.380
Your mum's been getting a
small payment

22:29.380 --> 22:31.620
from the fund
every month. William...

22:31.620 --> 22:33.660
We need the money now.
I'm afraid,

22:33.660 --> 22:35.860
by law, you're still a minor,

22:35.860 --> 22:38.900
and therefore I can't let you
have the money just like that.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.580
Your mum would need to
come and see me herself.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.460
She's not very well.
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.460
Your file, Ms Perkins.

22:49.380 --> 22:51.340
Well...

22:55.820 --> 22:58.140
..you could ask
one of the other trustees.

23:01.460 --> 23:06.020
Hmm. Graham and Annabel
Parry, your grandparents.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.380
What?

23:07.380 --> 23:09.220
Ah.

23:09.220 --> 23:13.020
I recall there was some dispute
over your father's estate.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.780
Yes, here we are.
They have an Oxford address.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.900
I have grandparents in Oxford.

23:31.820 --> 23:34.420
Thanks. So...

23:34.420 --> 23:37.260
..you wanted to ask me
some questions?

23:41.540 --> 23:42.940
Sorry, they're a bit stale.

23:46.220 --> 23:49.380
OK. I promise to
answer your questions

23:49.380 --> 23:51.700
if you promise to answer
mine in return. Deal?

23:56.820 --> 23:58.740
Fire ahead.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.900
Do you study Dust?

24:00.900 --> 24:02.660
I don't know what your dust is,

24:02.660 --> 24:05.060
but we study something
called dark matter.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.300
And what's dark matter?

24:07.500 --> 24:10.900
We don't really know,
that's sort of the point.

24:10.900 --> 24:12.940
It's... It's not visible.

24:12.940 --> 24:17.900
It's the matter in between all
the known bits of the universe,

24:17.900 --> 24:19.740
stars and galaxies.

24:19.740 --> 24:21.700
You study physics?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.980
Er, sort of.

24:23.980 --> 24:27.820
Well, we were trying to find
a particular type of particle,

24:27.820 --> 24:31.220
one that doesn't respond to light,
so it's very difficult to detect.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.860
We call them shadow particles.

24:32.860 --> 24:35.980
We built an electromagnetic
field around a detector

24:35.980 --> 24:38.620
to try and isolate their signal,
and then we fed that

24:38.620 --> 24:42.460
through the Cave - our
computer - to amplify it.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.420
And...

24:47.420 --> 24:50.380
..what we discovered was
actually pretty extraordinary.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.740
I started testing objects
to see if the particles

24:56.740 --> 24:58.860
would respond differently.

25:05.220 --> 25:08.340
I saw more activity when
the items were man-made -

25:08.340 --> 25:12.060
a chess piece,
my I Ching box in particular.

25:20.660 --> 25:23.500
Finally, in a moment of madness,

25:23.500 --> 25:25.260
I attached myself.

25:27.540 --> 25:31.580
But it was only afterwards,
when I was lost in thought,

25:31.580 --> 25:33.180
that it happened.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.420
What did you find?

25:40.540 --> 25:43.340
The set of particles made contact.

25:43.340 --> 25:44.900
They seemed to be...

25:46.420 --> 25:47.580
..conscious.

25:48.820 --> 25:51.700
I don't know how else to put it.

25:52.740 --> 25:56.180
You can't see them
unless you expect to,

25:56.180 --> 25:58.740
unless you put your mind
in a certain state.

25:58.740 --> 26:01.060
Do you know the poet John Keats?

26:01.060 --> 26:04.380
He has a phrase for it -
negative capability.

26:04.380 --> 26:08.940
You have to hold your mind
in a state of expectation,

26:08.940 --> 26:10.860
without impatience.

26:12.020 --> 26:14.700
And then they flock to your
thoughts like birds.

26:15.980 --> 26:17.540
That's Dust.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.220
Lyra, how do you know about my work?

26:25.220 --> 26:27.260
None of it's published.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.140
Because of this.

26:43.820 --> 26:46.580
That's really beautiful.

26:46.580 --> 26:48.820
Is it some kind of game?

26:48.820 --> 26:50.260
It's not a game.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.100
It told me to look for the door
with a mountain on it.

26:56.100 --> 26:59.580
Ask me something
I'd never be able to know.

26:59.580 --> 27:00.820
Oh, gosh.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.820
Um...

27:04.980 --> 27:07.060
OK.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.500
Tell me what I did
before I became a scientist.

27:29.580 --> 27:30.860
You were a nun...

27:32.340 --> 27:34.620
..but you stopped believing
and you left.

27:36.940 --> 27:39.220
They'd never let you
do that in my world.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.540
Wha...?

27:42.420 --> 27:44.020
How did you do that?

27:46.660 --> 27:47.780
Well...

27:49.780 --> 27:50.980
..it's like you said.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.860
I put my mind in a sort of...

27:55.140 --> 27:56.540
..in-between state...

27:57.860 --> 27:59.620
..and the meanings just come to me.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.740
And that's how you knew
about my research?

28:01.740 --> 28:03.900
It told me you'd tell me about Dust.

28:03.900 --> 28:07.060
It's the original sin.
Original sin?

28:07.060 --> 28:09.580
I became a physicist

28:09.580 --> 28:11.780
so I wouldn't have to think about
things like that.

28:11.780 --> 28:13.300
Well, you need to.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.820
The Magisterium in my world
want to destroy it.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.500
Who are the Magisterium?

28:18.500 --> 28:20.620
They control everything.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.500
They think Dust is evil.

28:24.660 --> 28:26.980
But I think what they do is evil.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.780
Sometimes people are afraid of
things they don't understand.

28:34.700 --> 28:38.300
Dark matter does sound pretty
ominous, but in my experience,

28:38.300 --> 28:40.340
it's actually quite beautiful.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.260
Can I see your computer Cave?

28:47.620 --> 28:49.140
Please.

29:22.100 --> 29:25.940
We've been waiting for you to come
and see us, hoping you would.

29:27.540 --> 29:28.980
Why don't I know you?

29:30.580 --> 29:32.260
When your dad went missing...

29:33.580 --> 29:35.820
..we were all very upset.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.660
Some thoughtless words were said.

29:38.980 --> 29:41.660
But we're very happy
that you've found us.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.980
How is Elaine?

29:42.980 --> 29:44.780
We know she had a hard time

29:44.780 --> 29:46.700
after your father disappeared.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.140
Is she OK now?

29:48.140 --> 29:49.380
Why did he leave us?

29:49.380 --> 29:52.460
I know Johnny found it very
hard to be away from you.

29:52.460 --> 29:53.980
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

29:53.980 --> 29:56.300
I just need your help
with this trust stuff.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.060
Oh, for heaven's sake. You see.
What did I tell you?

29:59.060 --> 30:00.860
She sent him here for money.
Graham.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.460
She didn't send me anywhere.
Graham!

30:05.020 --> 30:07.300
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just give him a moment.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.220
DI Walters.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.060
It's Graham Parry.

30:21.060 --> 30:23.700
You were right, he came to us.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.940
Keep him there, I'm coming now.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.540
I understand why you're angry.

30:28.540 --> 30:33.260
John's absence has been hard on
all of us, but we can help you.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.380
You can even stay here if you like.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.100
Can Mum stay?

30:38.700 --> 30:41.780
It sounds like your mum needs
some professional help.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.260
How do you know that?

30:46.940 --> 30:48.300
Mum's fine.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.700
She's not fine, is she, Will?

30:50.700 --> 30:52.420
And neither are you.

30:53.700 --> 30:57.660
Your parents exchanged
letters and, for some reason,

30:57.660 --> 31:00.180
the police think that
they're important.

31:00.180 --> 31:03.260
If you could just explain
and help us find them,

31:03.260 --> 31:04.740
then all of this can be over.

31:04.740 --> 31:06.180
Oh!

31:06.180 --> 31:08.020
I'm sorry. Don't worry at all.

31:44.060 --> 31:45.540
You can sit just here.

31:48.180 --> 31:51.660
I'm just going to attach these
electrodes to your temples

31:51.660 --> 31:54.380
to hook you up, and when I do,
just try to clear your mind.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.660
You can look at that screen there.

31:56.660 --> 31:59.660
I've only managed to do this
once with a small response,

31:59.660 --> 32:01.220
so let's just see what happens.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.260
Oh, you can relax,
it won't hurt you.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.180
All set.

32:13.180 --> 32:15.100
Just...give it a go.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.020
What?

32:43.020 --> 32:44.620
Did I do something wrong?

32:44.620 --> 32:47.220
No, no, no. That's the...

32:47.220 --> 32:49.820
That's the best display I've ever
seen. What were you thinking?

32:49.820 --> 32:52.300
I was just asking if it was Dust.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.740
I think that means yes,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.740
but I can get it clearer
than that - look.

33:32.420 --> 33:33.980
What...?

33:33.980 --> 33:35.580
Those are pictures.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.460
It must be Dust.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.860
Your particles... It's talking in
the alethiometer's language now,

33:45.860 --> 33:48.100
but you could get it
fixed into words very easily.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.660
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Say that again.

33:50.660 --> 33:52.020
It says you're important.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.900
You have something important to do.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.620
But you have to make
the connection yourself.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.500
The Chinese box you have upstairs -

34:07.500 --> 34:09.260
you'll need it where you're going.

34:09.260 --> 34:10.900
You mean the I Ching?

34:13.100 --> 34:15.140
Time... Oh, no.

34:15.140 --> 34:18.980
Um, I have to leave, I'm late.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.460
What?! No, you can't go. Sorry.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.060
I've got someone waiting for me.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.300
Will you come back?
Tomorrow, please!

34:25.300 --> 34:26.620
OK.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.140
Bye.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.220
Come on, Lyra.

34:55.100 --> 34:59.180
Well, now that party's over,
I think I'll take my leave. Leave?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.580
What kind of woman raised
Father Graves, do you think?

35:02.620 --> 35:04.860
Did you see how he paraded himself?

35:04.860 --> 35:07.380
I cannot understand why he
is afforded such admiration.

35:07.380 --> 35:10.740
Sometimes, subtlety is overrated.

35:10.740 --> 35:11.940
What are you suggesting?

35:15.300 --> 35:18.340
You must go one step further
to beat him.

35:18.340 --> 35:19.860
My thanks to you, Lord. Mm.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.060
You heard Lanselius.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.660
We know where the witches
are vulnerable.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.260
It would be most irregular to act

35:28.260 --> 35:31.220
before the trials have terminated.

35:31.220 --> 35:35.100
Graves is a man of big words.
Be a man of big actions.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.540
The cardinalship is yours,

35:39.540 --> 35:40.900
you just need to show some...

35:42.260 --> 35:43.980
..strength.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.340
Will, I found the scholar!

35:51.340 --> 35:54.260
She's called Mary Malone and she's
got an engine that can see Dust,

35:54.260 --> 35:56.740
and she's going to make it talk.
Will, it was incredible.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.500
I found out the Dust might
not be sin at all.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.420
I don't know what it is,
but we need to find out.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.900
We need to go...now.

36:07.700 --> 36:08.900
Will.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.540
I never knew there were so
many ways to talk to Dust,

36:14.540 --> 36:15.940
actually talk to it.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.500
I mean, the alethiometer,
the Cave, the Chinese sticks...

36:18.500 --> 36:20.100
If I could just go
back there tomorrow

36:20.100 --> 36:21.740
and play a bit more
with the engine...

36:21.740 --> 36:24.540
Will, what's the matter?
I thought you'd been caught!

36:24.540 --> 36:27.260
I was waiting for you out there when
the police were looking for me,

36:27.260 --> 36:29.860
and you were playing.
I was doing something important.

36:29.860 --> 36:31.700
What am I doing around
waiting for you?

36:31.700 --> 36:33.220
What am I doing here?

36:33.220 --> 36:34.900
I came back here to make
sure my mum was OK,

36:34.900 --> 36:36.100
not to mess around with you.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.300
Because you need my help.
Why do I need your help?

36:38.300 --> 36:40.140
To find your father!

36:42.140 --> 36:43.620
What do you know about my father?

36:43.620 --> 36:45.300
I only...

36:45.300 --> 36:48.060
I don't know, I've only been told we
need to find him. Told by whom?

36:48.060 --> 36:52.140
They're lying. OK? My dad left me
and my mum took off to the Arctic.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.420
OK? He's dead.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.580
Will you let me show you?

37:03.020 --> 37:05.100
It's called an alethiometer.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.660
If you ask it a question,

37:06.660 --> 37:08.780
it will tell you the truth.

37:08.780 --> 37:11.260
I've asked it about your father.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.180
He took some letters
and he ran away.

37:16.540 --> 37:19.660
It was a man.
I think he was thief.

37:19.660 --> 37:20.900
And...

37:23.340 --> 37:24.660
..and you killed him.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.100
I wasn't meant to.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.100
They were scaring my mum.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.060
He tried to steal her letters...

37:34.100 --> 37:35.420
..and he fell.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.660
I can't stop thinking about it.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.540
Can you ask it whether
my mum's OK?

37:48.020 --> 37:49.740
I need to know she'll be all right.

37:56.060 --> 37:57.260
She's worried,

37:57.260 --> 37:59.780
but the man you left her with,
he's kind.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.220
She's safe.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.020
It says she's safe, Will.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.100
And that thing only
tells you the truth?

38:09.100 --> 38:13.180
Yeah, not good or bad, just truth.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.940
Did it really say
my dad was alive?

38:24.020 --> 38:26.220
It said we need to find him.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.580
I don't know who to trust any more.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.020
I didn't either.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.420
People that I thought were safe...

38:37.340 --> 38:39.180
..turned out not to be.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.500
But you can trust me.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.020
I won't give you away,
not to anyone, I promise.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.020
I've done that before.

38:55.020 --> 38:56.460
I betrayed someone.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.220
I hate myself for it.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.580
I'm going to have to leave her,
aren't I?

39:11.260 --> 39:12.860
Just like my dad did.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.140
I don't want to, Lyra.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.220
But I'll put her
in danger if I stay.

39:21.220 --> 39:24.820
The alethiometer told me you're
connected to Cittagazze.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.420
Maybe your father is, too.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.780
I like it here.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.580
Me too.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.780
I think it was the most
extraordinary

39:44.780 --> 39:46.900
discussion I've ever had.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.580
She had this quality about her.

39:49.580 --> 39:51.340
And the things she knew!

39:51.340 --> 39:56.140
Listen, Oliver, she achieved
the best results we've ever had.

39:56.140 --> 39:59.540
What we need is a tangible solution
to this funding situation.

39:59.540 --> 40:02.060
She hasn't got a spare million
as well, has she?

40:02.060 --> 40:05.020
She's going to come back tomorrow,
and then you'll see for yourself.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.180
Have a little faith.

40:06.180 --> 40:08.420
Oh, let's leave faith
out of it, shall we?

40:08.420 --> 40:10.380
Just get a good night's sleep.

40:19.420 --> 40:21.100
See you tomorrow.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.020
Mm-hm.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.100
Sorry to disturb.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.740
The council have approved
your proposal.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.180
The men are ready.

40:47.180 --> 40:50.940
The order only needs your signature,
and we shall launch the airships.

40:57.060 --> 41:00.260
A great many of us are in
support of this, Father.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.340
The witches must be cleansed.

41:14.620 --> 41:17.340
I'm praying for your success
at the vote this evening.

41:18.380 --> 41:19.540
Hmm.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.500
It has to be done.

41:45.660 --> 41:46.980
It all...

41:48.220 --> 41:50.540
..had to be done.

41:50.540 --> 41:53.220
Yes, a necessary sin.

41:54.780 --> 41:55.980
But still a sin.

41:57.260 --> 41:58.580
We will atone for it.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.260
Put your hand out.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.300
I gave you every chance to escape...

42:43.460 --> 42:44.900
..and yet here you are.

42:47.980 --> 42:50.100
I haven't got long, Thorold.

42:51.420 --> 42:53.580
I believe Lyra's in danger,

42:53.580 --> 42:56.220
so if Asriel knew anything
of her whereabouts,

42:56.220 --> 42:57.500
you must tell me.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.140
Well, they came to the lab.

43:01.180 --> 43:03.100
What? When?

43:03.100 --> 43:06.140
She travelled all that
way to find him...

43:06.140 --> 43:08.260
..and he was going to...

43:09.900 --> 43:11.140
What, Thorold?

43:13.020 --> 43:14.340
..cut her...

43:15.700 --> 43:18.380
..and use the energy
to create a window.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.940
Instead, he used a boy,
the kitchen boy.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.660
He never mentioned the prophecy.

43:24.660 --> 43:26.020
Where did she go?

43:27.220 --> 43:28.660
She went to save the boy.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.140
She's...

43:33.260 --> 43:36.340
She's followed Asriel, she's
followed him through that window.

43:38.700 --> 43:41.140
She's in another world entirely.

43:44.620 --> 43:47.540
Thank you, Thorold.

46:55.340 --> 46:56.540
Marisa.

46:58.460 --> 47:02.300
They voted unanimously
in my favour.

47:04.740 --> 47:06.140
I owe you my thanks.

47:07.380 --> 47:09.220
You have nothing to thank me for.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.820
Don't you see?

47:13.820 --> 47:15.460
This...

47:15.460 --> 47:17.180
..is a curse.

47:17.180 --> 47:18.780
A web of my design

47:18.780 --> 47:21.700
in which you are both
the spider and the fly.

47:23.260 --> 47:25.540
I have had to bite my lip

47:25.540 --> 47:27.580
while all of you parade around,

47:27.580 --> 47:30.380
concocting your
fearful little schemes,

47:30.380 --> 47:32.500
daring to judge me.

47:33.540 --> 47:35.180
And all the while,

47:35.180 --> 47:36.860
there's a myriad of universes

47:36.860 --> 47:39.420
out there that you could
only hope to fathom.

47:39.420 --> 47:41.140
Careful.

47:41.140 --> 47:43.300
You forget yourself.

47:43.300 --> 47:44.980
I forget myself?

47:47.180 --> 47:49.460
No, Cardinal.

47:49.460 --> 47:52.540
I have a very, very good memory.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.060
And since you need
the past to remain buried,

47:55.060 --> 47:57.940
you'll turn the other cheek
while I take what I want.

47:59.980 --> 48:01.540
Where are you going?

48:05.340 --> 48:07.220
I'm leaving.

48:07.220 --> 48:09.180
Where?

48:09.180 --> 48:11.580
Are you going to find Asriel?

48:14.060 --> 48:15.460
No.

48:15.460 --> 48:19.580
I'm in search of something
infinitely more valuable.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.660
Good luck, Hugh.
