45:20.485 --> 45:22.821
We have to--
We have to get out
of this town

45:22.854 --> 45:24.289
and start building
an audience again.

45:24.322 --> 45:25.390
So pack
your lunches.
Two weeks.

45:25.423 --> 45:26.424
Yeah.
We're going on tour.

45:26.457 --> 45:27.959
You know, uh--
You know we have

45:27.993 --> 45:29.127
our gigs on Thursdays
and Sundays.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.428
Every Thursday.

45:30.461 --> 45:32.263
Okay. Why don't
we go to the Gem,

45:32.297 --> 45:33.799
and we'll just have
a beer, and we'll
talk about it.

45:33.832 --> 45:35.133
No, you know what?
My sitter's done at 4:00.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.167
Okay, okay.
But you're
coming, right?

45:36.201 --> 45:37.535
Just because I've had a baby

45:37.568 --> 45:38.904
doesn't mean I can't
come on tour, okay?

45:38.937 --> 45:39.871
Okay, Sweetie, good.

45:40.939 --> 45:42.540
I can't go.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.375
I already used up
all my vacation
on the recording.

45:44.409 --> 45:45.977
Okay.
I can't just go on tour.

45:46.011 --> 45:47.545
It's a temp job.
Take some time off.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.848
No, they made me permanent
six months ago.
I told you that.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.050
You either decide
to be in the band, or
you don't. Like, what--

45:52.083 --> 45:54.920
I am in the band, but you
have to check with the band
before you book a tour.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.788
I have ten people's
schedules in my head.
I'm trying to org--

45:56.822 --> 45:57.789
A 3-week tour?

45:57.823 --> 45:58.790
2 1/2 or something.

45:58.824 --> 46:00.025
I'm going.

46:00.058 --> 46:01.793
Wait, don't you want
to come for a drink?

46:01.827 --> 46:02.928
Uh, no.
No, I'm cool.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.129
You're--
Come on, We'll toast--

46:04.162 --> 46:05.897
Why? You're going
to be talking

46:05.931 --> 46:06.932
about tour shit,
apparently.

46:06.965 --> 46:08.433
Tour shit?
I told you about this.

46:08.466 --> 46:10.802
Are you seriously
going to Espanola

46:10.836 --> 46:12.037
with a funk band?

46:12.070 --> 46:13.805
Claire.

46:13.839 --> 46:14.840
That's gonna--
Claire.

46:14.873 --> 46:15.941
It's not
the right crowd.

46:15.974 --> 46:17.275
You're so boring
sometimes, okay?

46:17.308 --> 46:19.144
I'll see you.
I'll see you later, okay?

46:21.312 --> 46:22.914
Okay.
Nobody knows us
outside of Toronto.

46:50.641 --> 46:53.945
...wedding, and my mom
had me wear this
ridiculous outfit.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.280
It had frills on it.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.048
You know
I don't wear frills.

46:57.082 --> 46:59.584
That's not me.

46:59.617 --> 47:00.952
What's up, Twist-off?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.989
Tiffany,
I really don't want

47:04.022 --> 47:05.323
to fucking
do this today, okay,

47:05.356 --> 47:06.858
so just shut
the fuck up, please.

47:06.892 --> 47:07.859
Really?
Yeah.

47:07.893 --> 47:09.627
You really want
to start this?

47:09.660 --> 47:13.264
I--I just said
I don't want to start
this, actually.

47:13.298 --> 47:17.035
Whatever. I have
to go to class. Let's go.

47:19.938 --> 47:22.440
Ohh! Ahh!
Get off of me.

47:22.473 --> 47:26.011
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

47:26.044 --> 47:27.478
You were screaming
like a little bitch.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.347
You had my hair
in your hand.
You saw it.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.049
Fuck. It's fake hair.
Can't even feel it.

47:31.082 --> 47:32.383
You have a fake face.
Whatever.

47:32.417 --> 47:33.584
You know what?
Both of you,

47:33.618 --> 47:35.253
I don't want
to hear it.
Stop it.

47:35.286 --> 47:38.289
In my office,
now.

47:38.323 --> 47:41.059

* You're so cold

48:01.079 --> 48:06.584
* You're so cold...

48:06.617 --> 48:08.987
And they were totally psyched
to go to the show, right?

48:09.020 --> 48:10.321
Correct.
And then I turn in,

48:10.355 --> 48:13.124
and it's a--
it's actually a gymnasium.

48:13.158 --> 48:14.292
A fucking
high school gymnasium?

48:14.325 --> 48:16.027
Yes, and
the booking agent says,

48:16.061 --> 48:17.662
"You said you wanted
to play Edmonton,

48:17.695 --> 48:19.197
but you didn't say
where in Edmonton."

48:19.230 --> 48:20.631
Did they play the show?
Did they walk out?

48:20.665 --> 48:22.968
Yes, they played the show.
No, no, no, they played it.

48:23.001 --> 48:24.402
They were fucking amazing.
They totally rocked it.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.072
All the ladies are
jumping, screaming.
Hey.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.073
Hey, sweetheart.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.208
You are
out of mints.
Hey.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.709
I was just
telling James

48:31.742 --> 48:35.080
what an awesome time
he's gonna have
on the road.

48:35.113 --> 48:36.081
Yep.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.648
So how's
it going?

48:37.682 --> 48:41.386
Not bad. You're having
beers with my mom
in my kitchen.

48:43.054 --> 48:44.089
Ahem.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.091
Don't trust him,
Claire.

48:46.124 --> 48:47.625
He's a musician.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.128
What?

48:52.097 --> 48:53.999
I came to see you.

48:54.032 --> 48:55.100
Me?

48:55.133 --> 48:57.035
You took off on me
after rehearsal.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.641
Aren't you supposed
to be on tour
or something?

49:03.674 --> 49:06.111
[ laughs ]
You're funny.

49:06.144 --> 49:08.346
I'm not trying
to be funny.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.982
Why don't you come? Hmm?

49:11.016 --> 49:13.118
Why don't you
come on the tour?

49:13.151 --> 49:14.585
What, to Espanola?

49:14.619 --> 49:16.187
[ laughs ]

49:16.221 --> 49:19.224
There is life
north of Edmonton,
you know, Claire.

49:19.257 --> 49:21.126
Really?
Mm-hmm.

49:21.159 --> 49:22.127
Not interested.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.294
Come on, I'm serious.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.565
I was watching you
the other night
in the crowd, and it...

49:29.634 --> 49:31.469
could be like that
every night.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.306
Hmm?

49:40.511 --> 49:42.213
When do you go?

49:44.215 --> 49:46.184
Wednesday.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.618
Or Tuesday.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.154
Hmm.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.256
I don't know.
It's Wednesday or Tuesday.

49:51.289 --> 49:52.423
I can't remember.

49:52.457 --> 49:55.193
I guess you got school
and stuff, huh?

49:56.627 --> 49:58.629
Yeah, I have
a math test tomorrow.

49:58.663 --> 49:59.597
You should go.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.669
RUTH: I usually
put a little bit
of mint in this,

50:04.702 --> 50:08.406
but Edward
forgot to get the mint
at the grocery store.

Mmm. It's okay.

by the way.

Oh, thank you.

50:13.711 --> 50:16.414
I made them for
a fundraising bake sale.

Mmm, for what?

50:17.448 --> 50:18.583
Planned Parenthood.

50:18.616 --> 50:20.685
Actually, I have
a pamphlet here.

50:23.654 --> 50:24.622
Thanks.

There's a number
on the back.

50:28.459 --> 50:29.727
Oh.

There's no such thing
as a stupid question.

we should, um...

50:38.636 --> 50:41.139
Oh, right.
Yeah.

50:41.172 --> 50:44.242
I'll just leave
you guys to, uh--

50:44.275 --> 50:46.211
Yeah. Just...

really friendly.

I was gay.

any acid left?

Uh, yeah, mm-hmm.

51:06.497 --> 51:08.233
Well,
for personal use.

51:08.266 --> 51:09.467
'Cause I was thinking

51:09.500 --> 51:13.304
that we could drop and
go to the planetarium.

Wow. Okay.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.207
Good idea?

to handle my balls?

would I mean?

52:07.925 --> 52:10.361
And I asked if, uh,
you think can handle them.

52:10.395 --> 52:11.529
I think I can try.

52:11.562 --> 52:13.130
You got some confidence?
Yep.

at a--at a pool party.

can see how things

will get, uh, blown out
of proportion, then.

just exaggerating
though, and...

to worry about it,

with having wisdom.

to pass it on.

to some people.

that even after
all these years,

even changed

01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:04.507
You were absent.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.042
Well, I'm embarrassed,
okay?

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.812
Because I don't
understand math,

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.747
and it makes me feel
like an idiot,

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.048
and I'm lost,

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.784
and I feel like I can't
even concentrate,

01:29:15.818 --> 01:29:17.686
so I don't
come to class,

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.555
and that's why.
And I don't--

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:22.858
Now I have a friend,
and I think he
can help me.

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:24.793
You have a friend?
Yeah.

01:29:26.128 --> 01:29:27.129
Hmm.

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:28.597
And he's really smart,

01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:31.066
and I think he
could probably help me.

01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:35.938
All right, people,
wake up.

01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:38.907
Hey, just
because this is
remedial gym,

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:41.109
doesn't mean
you won't sweat.

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:44.813
Now, we're
gonna start with
a long-distance run.

01:29:44.847 --> 01:29:47.082
We're gonna go twice
around the school.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.951
Take as much time
as you need.

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:50.653
On your mark.
Get set. Go.

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:51.654
[ faint whistle ]

01:29:51.687 --> 01:29:53.789
* I'm fine

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:55.924
* But I've nothing to give

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:57.726
* But I just
have to leave... *

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.462
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Jeez.

01:29:59.495 --> 01:30:00.629
I can taste blood.

01:30:00.663 --> 01:30:01.630
Oh, actually?

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:07.035
I seriously
might die.

01:30:09.472 --> 01:30:10.706
Oh, come on.

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:13.676
* I don't want
to be seen, enough *

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:16.579
* I would run
and live on a train *

01:30:16.612 --> 01:30:19.147
* Yes, I lie

01:30:19.181 --> 01:30:21.984
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:25.420
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:29.157
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:31.994
* Oh, oh

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.830
* Face

01:30:36.665 --> 01:30:39.067
* I'm down

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:41.003
* 'Cause I've
nothing to lose *

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:43.138
* I'm alone in a cruise

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.573
* Enough

01:30:44.607 --> 01:30:47.209
* I would run
and live on a train *

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:49.111
* And now

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:53.616
* I'm crying

01:30:53.649 --> 01:30:55.618
* 'Cause I don't want
to be here *

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:58.854
* I don't want
to be seen, enough *

01:30:58.887 --> 01:31:01.724
* I would run
and live on a train *

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:04.159
* Yes, I lie

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:07.162
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:11.734
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:31:11.767 --> 01:31:15.504
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:31:15.538 --> 01:31:18.807
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:22.711
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:31:22.745 --> 01:31:26.048
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:28.884
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:31:30.085 --> 01:31:31.754
* Oh, oh

01:31:31.787 --> 01:31:34.657
* Ahh

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.993
* Ahh

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:41.897
* Destination nowhere

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.601
* On this train

01:31:45.634 --> 01:31:49.104
* Destination nowhere

01:31:49.137 --> 01:31:51.106
* On the train

01:31:51.139 --> 01:31:55.210
* You got nothing to lose

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:57.713
* Except you

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:02.050
* Yes, I lie

01:32:02.084 --> 01:32:04.920
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:08.624
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:32:08.657 --> 01:32:12.260
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.297
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:32:16.832 --> 01:32:20.302
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:23.906
* Oh, baby, I lie

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:26.742
* If I tell you that I'm right

01:32:27.843 --> 01:32:29.578
* Oh, oh
