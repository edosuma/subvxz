00:31.760 --> 00:33.880
[sighs]

00:33.960 --> 00:35.800
[in Norwegian]
Could you at least help me a bit?

00:37.120 --> 00:41.280
- My fingers get so cold.
- Is that so?

00:41.360 --> 00:42.880
Yeah.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.320
Anyway, I'll see you later.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.320
[sighs]

01:00.480 --> 01:03.160
- [dog yelping]
- What the...?

01:06.160 --> 01:08.600
[whale bellowing]

01:13.600 --> 01:16.080
[theme music playing]

01:51.320 --> 01:53.320
[engine revving]

02:03.480 --> 02:05.000
[Roy in English] Ho, ho, ho!

02:05.080 --> 02:09.200
- Are you booked for a Christmas party?
- Yeah, but it's fucking closed.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.160
[Roy] Happy Christmas,
you fucking commie.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.760
- [woman screaming]
- [man grunting]

02:18.480 --> 02:20.120
[Roy grunts]

02:22.040 --> 02:23.440
[spits]

02:27.520 --> 02:29.320
Not one of the shooters.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.400
[Roy] You sure?

02:34.440 --> 02:36.800
Okay. You're sure.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.720
Make this look like a random mugging.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.000
[in Norwegian] Do you mind if I take that?
I've always had a thing for pink gold.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.160
[anchor on TV]  Hollywood star
and animal lover Hayden Panettiere

02:59.240 --> 03:00.920
posted a blog today

03:01.000 --> 03:05.840
claiming the Norwegian authorities are
not doing enough to help Heikki the whale.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.480
[Torgeir in English] So, boys...

03:07.560 --> 03:09.240
[in Norwegian] What do you think?

03:09.320 --> 03:11.760
[in English] This is happening, right?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.560
- [Arne in Norwegian] Bloody hell.
- Huh?

03:13.640 --> 03:16.320
A Norwegian was arrested in Brazil
for drug smuggling.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.680
Thirty-eight-year-old Roar Lien
from Lillehammer

03:20.760 --> 03:23.800
was arrested this morning.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.640
[in English]  I just want to say
I'm innocent. This is bullshit!

03:26.720 --> 03:29.840
[in Norwegian]  Brazilian authorities
maintain that Lien planned to use

03:29.920 --> 03:35.320
a wedding cruise as a front
to smuggle 10 kilos of cocaine.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.520
[Johnny in English] So when exactly
did you plan on telling me

03:37.600 --> 03:40.760
- we're bringing cocaine in from Brazil?
- No, he's... He's innocent.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.800
He never said a word about cocaine.

03:43.880 --> 03:49.880
I'm 100% sure he's innocent,
or 98% sure he's innocent.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.680
Ninety-eight or 100?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.440
Well, what's the difference, you know?

03:53.520 --> 03:57.200
He's my brother.
He's the only brother I have.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.240
- [bars clanging]
- [prisoners clamoring]

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
[shouting continuing]

04:28.080 --> 04:29.080
Hello.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.280
[chuckles] It looks like someone did
a bad painting job here.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.600
It's not paint.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.320
Well, so what happened?

04:47.560 --> 04:50.560
He snored too much is what happened.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.680
[Roar exhales]

05:10.840 --> 05:14.040
Hi, it's great to see you all.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.680
Welcome to today's
anger management class.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.760
How are you?

05:18.840 --> 05:22.240
- Hi, there. I see you've started.
- Hi!

05:22.320 --> 05:28.400
This is Muhammad. He'll be joining
our anger management class.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.200
[Jan] Hi. It's great to meet all of you.

05:31.280 --> 05:36.040
People often feel intimidated

05:36.120 --> 05:37.960
when they encounter us Muslims.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Ooh-aah!

05:39.120 --> 05:40.360
[Jan laughs]

05:40.440 --> 05:45.200
So I thought
I'd start off with a little joke.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.840
What do you say to a Muslim

05:48.920 --> 05:52.680
with his hand stuck up a camel's ass?

05:52.760 --> 05:53.760
[Rannveig laughs]

05:53.840 --> 05:58.160
- "Engine trouble?"
- [Rannveig] That's a good one.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.720
[in Arabic] This man isn't a real Muslim.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.360
[Jan laughs]

06:03.440 --> 06:08.320
[in Arabic] I understand
what you're saying. I can speak Arabic.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.080
Then maybe you'll understand this:

06:11.160 --> 06:15.600
tell one more racist joke
and I'll cut your balls off. [spits]

06:15.680 --> 06:17.720
[in Norwegian] No, Rashid! Stop it.

06:17.800 --> 06:24.040
We have agreed that in this group
we would all speak Norwegian. Okay?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.120
So...

06:27.200 --> 06:32.200
Maybe you'd like to tell us
how you ended up here?

06:32.280 --> 06:33.560
[Jan] Sure.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.040
The thing is...

06:36.120 --> 06:40.000
...I killed a wonderful girl
whose name is...

06:40.080 --> 06:42.080
...was Randi.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.920
We had some professional differences.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.880
And I completely lost it.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.560
[growls] So watch out, Rashid!

06:52.640 --> 06:53.880
[Jan laughs]

06:53.960 --> 06:57.480
I'm just kidding. I was just joking.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.400
It's important to be able to joke around

07:02.480 --> 07:04.960
about something as serious as murder.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.720
[sighs] Yeah.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.200
Does anyone else here feel a little angry?

07:13.280 --> 07:16.440
Would anyone
like to share anything with us?

07:22.840 --> 07:26.080
[in English] I'm just a Maxi Taxi driver
from Norway, you know.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.640
I don't think I can handle this.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.360
Don't think so much.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.760
But my cellmate, he kills people.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.640
- Stop it.
- [crying] Sorry.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.000
- [Oscarito] Stop it.
- I'm sorry.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.720
Listen, partner.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.000
To show fear is to invite the devil.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.960
Prison is hell.

07:44.040 --> 07:48.400
A man in prison has no other choice
than to embrace the flames.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.600
Got it?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.600
Now eat your fucking food.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.160
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

08:14.960 --> 08:16.360
[in Norwegian] Hi. Welcome.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.120
Torgeir Lien.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.560
Follow me.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.160
[Ekern] You have our deepest sympathy.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.640
- We are doing everything we can to help.
- [Torgeir] I appreciate it.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.800
[in English] My brother is innocent.
Hundred percent innocent.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.640
Well, we are currently gathering
information about Roar's situation.

08:33.720 --> 08:38.080
We have also put together a group
of crisis management psychologists.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.760
Psychologists?

08:39.840 --> 08:42.440
Yes, to help you get through
this difficult time.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.520
All due respect,

08:45.600 --> 08:50.920
if you want to help us,
send in the fucking Norwegian Navy SEALs.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.160
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that you fully appreciate

08:53.240 --> 08:56.280
how delicate situations like this
must be handled.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.480
I am an American.

08:58.560 --> 09:02.160
We know what to do when
a banana republic fucks with our citizens.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.320
Listen, I'm really sorry,
but I have a ten o'clock meeting.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.120
- We'll get back to you--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not done.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.840
Fuck your ten o'clock.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.720
I'll go talk to 'em

09:15.240 --> 09:17.440
I don't think that's a very good--

09:17.520 --> 09:19.200
[in Norwegian] You heard him.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.560
Navy SEALs.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.880
[in English] Excuse me, folks. I'm sorry.
You got to come back another day.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.120
And...

09:32.200 --> 09:33.840
Who are you?

09:33.920 --> 09:36.280
I'm the guy
with a friend in jail in Brazil,

09:36.360 --> 09:39.920
and we need Mr. Secretary right now,
so it's a matter of life or death.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.680
[scoffs] We are also here
to address life or death.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.760
There is a beautiful blue whale
stranded in Lofoten.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.360
A blue whale?

09:47.440 --> 09:50.080
Who cares?
What is this  Free Willy  bullshit?

09:50.160 --> 09:55.120
Please. You're blocking my way,
and I have a whale to save.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.520
[in Norwegian] Don't touch him!

09:57.600 --> 10:00.280
- You fucking hippie!
- [Johnny] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:00.360 --> 10:03.600
All right, calm down. Calm down.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.560
[in Norwegian]
I am calm. I am calm. I'm calm.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.400
- [Johnny] All right?
- [Tormod] Okay?

10:08.480 --> 10:09.480
[Johnny] All right.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.960
[yells] Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

10:15.800 --> 10:18.120
Take it easy. Take it easy.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.440
[security guard in Norwegian]
No more trouble from you today, okay?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.720
[in English]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck you very much.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.880
[Torgeir] Yeah.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.520
[spits]

10:29.480 --> 10:31.160
What do we do now?

10:31.240 --> 10:33.640
[man] ...and in our involvement...

10:35.320 --> 10:36.680
[Ekern in Norwegian] Helicopter?

10:36.760 --> 10:39.520
The only way back to the sea
is across the mainland.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.800
How much will this operation cost?

10:48.640 --> 10:51.760
Seriously? Forget about it.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.960
You don't understand--

10:54.040 --> 10:55.880
I need you to come with me.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.120
I'm sorry. I have to go.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.320
[Johnny in English, on TV]
It's a shame and a tragedy

11:02.400 --> 11:06.200
when the richest country in the world
can't protect its own citizens.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.840
This man's innocent brother

11:07.920 --> 11:11.680
has been arrested in Latin America
for no good reason.

11:11.760 --> 11:16.520
[reporter in Norwegian]  How do you feel
about this? Do you miss your brother?

11:17.520 --> 11:20.080
You could say...

11:20.160 --> 11:21.920
...that I love him.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.880
That's right. And what's the government
doing about it? Absolutely nothing.

11:27.960 --> 11:33.360
Well, we're flying to Rio in the morning.
I only pray that we're in time.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.800
[in Norwegian]  A strong indictment
of Norwegian crisis management.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.680
Back to the studio.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.000
Ida, book two tickets to Rio.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.320
[Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66's
"Mas Que Nada" playing]

12:16.320 --> 12:17.880
[in English] Do you want a taste?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.840
I outgrew mystery meat
somewhere around puberty.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.680
[in Norwegian]
I've been eating kebabs for 20 years.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.480
[in English] So my immune system
is super strong, you know.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.640
[loud gurgling]

12:35.720 --> 12:40.480
- So how is that immune system doing?
- I'm just... I'm cool.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.800
It's just probably the jet lag. No biggie.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.160
Oh, there's Alex.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.440
Jeez. Well, they'll probably have a few
good years before menopause, huh?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.040
[in Norwegian] No, she's the other one.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.160
The other one.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.440
[Johnny] Wow.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.600
Where did that come from?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.080
Uh... Internet.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.240
I got to get me one of those Internets.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.920
- [Torgeir] Hi.
- [Alex] Hi.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.840
- Good to see you, Torgeir.
- [Torgeir] Good to see you, too.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.280
I'll just have a quick look at the hotel.
Just have a...

13:16.480 --> 13:17.760
What's wrong with him?

13:17.840 --> 13:22.760
- He decided to sample the local cuisine.
- [laughs] Oh.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.240
[Johnny chuckles]

13:24.320 --> 13:26.920
- Johnny.
- Alex.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.400
Please.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.280
[whistling]

13:45.360 --> 13:49.080
[in Brazilian Portuguese]  Your heart is
pounding like a herd of wild bulls.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.960
Oh, God!

13:51.040 --> 13:56.240
You wrote  The Half Sister  screenplay?
How did you come up with all that?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.320
I smoked a lot of crack back then.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.960
Awesome, dude. Awesome.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.480
I am not a woman.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.640
[woman on TV]  Hector's coming!

14:17.800 --> 14:21.040
Look! Our cleaning lady
looks just like Hector Rossi.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.640
[laughing]

14:22.720 --> 14:24.600
[sniggers] Check it out.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.760
Hector has a double.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.840
[laughing]

14:29.920 --> 14:31.280
[in Englsih] What the fuck is this?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.760
Hey, come here, Hectorina.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.200
Give me an autograph!

14:35.280 --> 14:39.240
You're going to let that little jerk
disrespect you in front of everybody?

14:39.320 --> 14:41.320
[laughing]

14:47.840 --> 14:49.240
Oh!

14:49.320 --> 14:50.720
[shouting]

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
It was the gringo!

14:52.880 --> 14:54.520
[Roar in Englsih] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.600
[chanting in Brazilian Portuguese]
Fight! Fight!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.080
You will die.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.640
[prisoners] Fight! Fight!

15:04.720 --> 15:06.840
No, no, no.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.640
[prisoners] Fight! Fight!

15:09.720 --> 15:11.720
[Roar sobs]

15:14.000 --> 15:17.600
[in Norwegian] Pie question!
Pie question! Pie question!

15:19.680 --> 15:22.760
[man] Okay, guys.
I'll give you the pie question.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.840
- The subject is history, all right?
- Yes.

15:25.920 --> 15:31.160
"Which royal house
did Henry VIII belong to?"

15:31.240 --> 15:34.480
[man 2]
What kind of a question is that?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.680
I could be of help with that question...

15:38.720 --> 15:40.240
...if you need another player.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.520
[Jan chuckles]

15:41.600 --> 15:44.000
I just got some bad vibes, guys.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.720
Did I say something wrong?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.120
Don't you recognize me?

15:51.120 --> 15:52.520
No.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.960
Two thousand six.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.920
Case 17B.
Permanent disability benefits.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.800
Denied by caseworker Johansen.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.560
You had much longer hair back then.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.000
A lot was different back then.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.560
Can't we let bygones be bygones?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.680
That was almost 10 years ago.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.640
Let's play some other time, guys.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.360
[Buffalo Springfield's
"Expecting to Fly" playing]

16:29.680 --> 16:31.040
[Jan in Arabic]  Oh, God.

16:32.480 --> 16:37.200
As long as you're not angry at me, I will
not worry about any other difficulties.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.920
[sobs] But...

16:47.400 --> 16:49.120
PRAYER ROOM

16:55.200 --> 16:57.520
- [in Norwegian] Everyone has a right--
- [Rashid] Shut up!

16:57.600 --> 17:01.360
No fake Muslims allowed.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.360
[Johnny]  Salute.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.880
[in English] So, uh, we've known
each other, what? An hour now?

17:25.960 --> 17:28.600
I think I can ask you a personal question.
What do you think?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.240
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.320
Do you love him?

17:38.960 --> 17:42.120
Yeah, yeah. He's nice.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.360
Nice?

17:47.840 --> 17:51.480
Look, Johnny. You live in
the richest country in the world.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.240
I mean, you can afford emotions.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.200
Okay.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.200
What happens if, by some chance,

18:01.280 --> 18:03.520
you meet someone

18:03.600 --> 18:05.880
that you really make a connection with?

18:07.280 --> 18:10.600
[cell phone rings]

18:11.960 --> 18:13.200
[Alex] I'm sorry. Just...

18:14.840 --> 18:16.840
[in Brazilian Portuguese] Hi, Dad.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.040
In the hospital? But how?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.640
[in English] Um... Excuse me.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.760
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Why is he in the hospital?

18:23.840 --> 18:26.160
I'll grab a taxi. See you in a bit.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.720
[in English]
Everything all right?

18:32.960 --> 18:37.720
No. There was a fight at the prison
and my brother got stabbed.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.720
- How bad?
- I don't know. He's in the hospital.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.760
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I have to go see him, so... Sorry.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.320
Was Roar involved?

19:02.800 --> 19:07.120
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
How nice. Look at the little girl.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
[chattering]

19:15.160 --> 19:16.600
[in English]
Excuse me.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.840
[clears throat] I'm here to see Roar Lien.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.600
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Unit 3. Take him there.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.040
[Torgeir in English] No. You're...

19:38.120 --> 19:39.160
You're, uh...

19:39.240 --> 19:42.560
You're at the...
You're in the wrong place.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.080
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Mariana, my love.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.320
[inmate pants]

19:47.400 --> 19:49.920
[in English]  Mister,
you're in the wrong booth.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.600
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Tell me more about your lovely legs.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.440
[inmate breathes heavily]

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
[pants]

20:05.680 --> 20:08.040
[in English]  Uh... Excuse me.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.000
Sir?

20:10.080 --> 20:14.200
A blind pervo
took my brother's booth, so I...

20:14.280 --> 20:17.560
[in Brazilian Portuguese] The gringo was
sent to the sex offender unit.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.320
[laughing]

20:19.400 --> 20:20.360
[hoots]

20:20.440 --> 20:21.640
[guard in English]
Sorry. Mistake.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.480
[in Brazilian Portuguese] Try Unit 2.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.000
[keys jingling]

20:48.240 --> 20:49.360
[in Norwegian]  Hi.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.880
[Torgeir sniffles]

20:53.640 --> 20:55.240
Is everything all right?

20:56.240 --> 20:57.760
[Roar sniffles]

20:57.840 --> 20:59.120
[whimpers]  No.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.480
We'll take care of this. We will.

21:05.560 --> 21:10.160
Don't worry. We're meeting
some really important people tomorrow.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.800
I'm never getting out of here.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.000
Don't talk like that. Don't!

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
[buzzing]

21:23.120 --> 21:24.280
[Torgeir] What's that?

21:24.360 --> 21:27.000
I'm never getting out of here.

21:27.080 --> 21:30.400
Wagner sent this death message.

21:30.480 --> 21:34.320
- He's coming for me.
-  Who's Wagner?

21:34.400 --> 21:37.760
[sobs]  Please, just...

21:37.840 --> 21:39.480
[gasps]   He's going to...

21:41.400 --> 21:42.480
[muffled] Roar!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.560
[muffled] Torgeir!

21:46.640 --> 21:49.480
[cries] I'm so scared, Torgeir!
I'm so scared!

21:49.560 --> 21:51.440
We're going to get you out of here!

21:52.600 --> 21:54.440
[shouts] We're going to get you out!

22:32.920 --> 22:35.600
[in English] The head
of the Brazilian delegation, Anton Ortiz,

22:35.680 --> 22:37.880
will meet us at the consulate
in half an hour.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.160
The meeting is about the Amazon fund.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.000
We will have about five minutes
to discuss Mr. Lien's case

22:43.080 --> 22:45.200
after the rainforest session.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.160
- Good.
- But please let me do the talking.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.280
You're just there to play the part
of the grieving family, yeah?

22:51.360 --> 22:55.600
It's your tribe. You know the lingo.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.760
[Torgeir] Okay.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.800
[in Norwegian]
Are you going to the beach?

22:59.880 --> 23:00.920
Huh?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.440
Do you intend to meet Anton Ortiz
in shorts?

23:04.520 --> 23:08.280
These are zip-off pants. I'll put on
the bottom part before I meet him.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.160
- I'm not an idiot!
- Of course not.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.080
[in English] I'll just go and see
if the driver is here.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.720
- [in English] What?
- Was he dissing me right now?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.400
- Him?
- Yeah.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.280
Nah. He's just jealous.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.160
- Yeah.
- [Johnny] Come on.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.520
[in Brazilian Portuguese, on radio]
Activists have taken to the streets today

23:33.600 --> 23:36.080
to protest against whaling

23:36.160 --> 23:41.280
after a beached whale was found
in pro-whaling Norway.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.160
[protesters in English] Stop killing
the whales! Stop killing the whales!

23:45.240 --> 23:48.080
- [in Norwegian] Is this a capoeira party?
- This is no capoeira party.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.760
[in English] It's your fault.
You liberals.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.880
- Give these hippies an inch, and then...
- [protesters] Stop killing the whales!

23:53.960 --> 23:55.560
[Johnny] It's your fault.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.520
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Why are you in Brazil?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.360
You have no right
to treat whales like this.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.360
[yells] It's a fish. Who cares?

24:02.760 --> 24:05.000
What's your problem, man?

24:05.080 --> 24:08.520
- [Johnny] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No way Norway!

24:08.600 --> 24:10.920
[shouting indistinctly]

24:11.000 --> 24:12.320
[Johnny] The press is here.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.440
[protesters shouting]

24:21.440 --> 24:23.480
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
What a bunch of idiots!

24:23.560 --> 24:24.880
[in English]
Are you all right?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.160
Yeah, yeah. I'm just...

24:26.240 --> 24:28.720
I've got to zip my pants. Toilet?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.200
[Ekern in Norwegian] In there.

24:30.280 --> 24:34.200
Let's bring Ortiz in
through the back door.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.760
- The meeting has been canceled.
- What?

24:37.840 --> 24:43.360
Ortiz wants no contact with Norway as
long as the negative attention continues.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
[sighs]

24:46.240 --> 24:49.160
- [in English] Where does that leave Roar?
- Now, listen.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.760
The Climate and Forest Initiative
is our most prestigious project.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.200
I'm not going to risk that
defending some drug trafficker.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.880
Alleged drug trafficker.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.440
It's politics. It's not about
how things are,

25:01.520 --> 25:04.200
it's about how they appear.

25:04.280 --> 25:08.000
[in Norwegian] Ida, call the press office.
It's time to put out some fires.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.120
[Ida] Yeah, sure.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.120
[Ekern in English]
You boys just have to wait in line.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.320
Yes, hello?

25:15.760 --> 25:17.160
What?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.160
They canceled the meeting.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.800
What? They canceled?

25:29.080 --> 25:30.960
No...

25:31.040 --> 25:32.160
What?

25:35.480 --> 25:36.880
But how...?

25:42.400 --> 25:44.440
[in Norwegian]
It will feel good to burn off

25:44.520 --> 25:46.200
some steam after a day like today.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.720
[in English] Nothing like a ski ride
in the old tropical sun, huh? Am I right?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.600
Absolutely.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.680
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.320
Don't forget your sports beverage.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.080
[in Brazilian Portuguese] Thank you.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.640
[in English] Got to hydrate.

26:11.520 --> 26:16.160

to the Center of the Mind" playing]

[sighs]

27:30.080 --> 27:31.600
[in Norwegian]
What are you doing here?

27:32.720 --> 27:34.880
We're closed.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.280
[in English] Good.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.800
Who hired you to snoop around
outside our massage parlor?

27:46.880 --> 27:50.280
[in Norwegian]
I haven't "snooped around" anywhere.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.600
And now I want you to leave.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.800
[Laila grunts]

28:08.880 --> 28:11.600
[groans, whimpers]

28:47.960 --> 28:51.640
[stammering in English]
Excuse me, but where am I?

28:51.720 --> 28:53.840
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
I don't speak English.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.360
[phone rings]

28:58.400 --> 28:59.920
[Ekern] I'm sorry.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.440
- Hello?
-  Hey, it's Johnny.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.720
We were worried sick here.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.520
I think I'm losing my mind. Can you...?

29:10.600 --> 29:14.000
[Johnny]  What happened? We're missing you
at the hotel. Where are you?

29:14.680 --> 29:15.800
Uh...

29:16.800 --> 29:19.680
I have... I have no idea. It's, um...

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
Wait, it's...

29:25.520 --> 29:30.000
Eros... Motel Vidigal.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.320
[Johnny]
Okay, hold on. We'll be right over.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.520
Okay.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.880
Yes, I'm...

29:41.040 --> 29:42.880
I'm so sorry. It's, uh...

29:50.320 --> 29:53.480
Somebody must have drugged me.
I don't remember a thing.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.760
My guess is you probably roller-skied
right into the wrong part of town.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.120
[Torgeir] Thank you and thank you.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.600
What have we got?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.280
Let's see.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.320
[women laughing]

30:13.400 --> 30:15.920
[Johnny] All right. Oh, boy.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.880
Well, it looks like these girls got
some kind of extortion scheme going on.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.000
Huh?

30:26.080 --> 30:30.040
They videotaped you doing things
that may still be illegal in Norway.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
What do they want?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.120
[woman]  Dirty boy.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.120
What they want

30:35.200 --> 30:38.760
is for you to start paying some
fucking attention to Roar's situation.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.640
Pay some fucking attention.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
It's you?

30:43.080 --> 30:46.840
It's you who's responsible
for this blackmail?

30:46.920 --> 30:50.080
Blackmail's such an ugly word.
Call it a wake-up call.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.720
[gasps] Oh, Jesus.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.760
[Johnny] What's important now

30:53.840 --> 30:57.360
is what you're prepared to do
to keep this from coming out.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.640
I'll report this to the police.
What really happened.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.040
You could do that,

31:03.120 --> 31:05.560
but a wise man once told me,

31:05.640 --> 31:09.200
politics is all about appearances.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.400
And it looks to me
like some guy having a very good time.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.440
[Ekern] Oh, my God.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.320
Do you really think,
"They drugged me and made me do it,"

31:17.400 --> 31:23.080
is going to fly when this gets dropped
into the in-boxes of every world embassy?

31:23.160 --> 31:24.920
You like doggy-style, huh?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.360
[Torgeir barks]

31:28.520 --> 31:32.120
[stammers]
Okay, fine. What do you want me to do?

31:32.200 --> 31:35.920
[in Norwegian]  And now over to Vesterålen,
where things are starting to happen.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.760
These images show military helicopters

31:40.840 --> 31:46.080
on their way
to bring Heikki the whale to safety.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.440
All you do is watch TV all day.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.560
Don't you know
those wild animals need fresh air?

31:54.960 --> 31:58.240
Can't you take her?
It's freezing out there!

31:59.760 --> 32:04.560
I realize it's hard to leave
your life in Oslo. But enough is enough.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.080
There's more life
in that beached whale than you!

32:11.880 --> 32:15.840
Undersecretary Rolv Ekern had this to say.

32:15.920 --> 32:20.720
[Ekern on TV]  We were glad to have
an opportunity to show our support

32:20.800 --> 32:22.120
for the animal's welfare.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.480
[in English] I love the way you guys
handled the situation with the whale.

32:28.560 --> 32:33.080
You know us... animal rights,
a proud Norwegian tradition.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.680
So, have you looked
at the offer we sent you?

32:36.760 --> 32:40.360
Yes, I have. It's, um...

32:40.440 --> 32:46.320
Look. I know.
$3,000 per hectare is a little steep.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.200
We're actually prepared
to pay the asking price this time.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.440
It's just, um...

32:53.360 --> 32:55.640
We need something in return.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.480
Yes?

32:57.560 --> 33:01.280
We need you to release
a Norwegian prisoner.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.160
Are you trying to bribe me, Mr. Ekern?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.760
You know, Anton...
You mind if I call you Anton?

33:12.840 --> 33:17.520
We're very proud of Rolv back in Norway.
He's one of our finest diplomats.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.600
But business just isn't his thing.

33:20.680 --> 33:26.960
What we had in mind was more like
5,000 times your 750 hectares.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.680
How does that sound?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.840
What would that total amount come to?

33:32.920 --> 33:36.720
Roughly $3.75 million.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.520
Well...

33:42.800 --> 33:47.640
...correcting human rights violations
has always been very important to me.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.880
What's the prisoner's name?

34:03.000 --> 34:06.600
[in Norwegian]
I didn't say a word to that woman.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.920
We'll get them, Laila.
Try to get some nourishment.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.840
Arne, you do realize
we'll have to seek revenge today?

34:14.920 --> 34:17.400
The boss told us to stay put.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.520
You're in charge. You have a job to do.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.880
Do you think Johnny
would let them get away with this?

34:23.960 --> 34:25.840
No way!

34:25.920 --> 34:28.280
Fine. I'll call one of the boys.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.560
- Are you okay?
- Mm.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.240
[Roy] Hello.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.000
[quietly] Where are they?

34:49.080 --> 34:51.520
I thought you said they would be here.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.040
They must be nearby.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.200
[Andrius in English] Here is your share.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.480
I'm glad.
We're moving in the right direction.

35:15.960 --> 35:19.120
[in Norwegian] Maybe we should get
a massage while we wait...

35:20.320 --> 35:23.000
...so we don't look too suspicious.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.880
I think you're right.

[in Lithuanian] Hi, faggot.

35:52.320 --> 35:56.120
[shouts in Norwegian]
Arne, get the hell out of here!

35:56.200 --> 35:57.320
Shit!

35:57.400 --> 35:59.680
[yells] Get out of here!

36:34.400 --> 36:35.800
- Hi.
- [Johnny] Hi.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.280
Excuse me.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.560
You know we're not
picking him up until later, right?

36:40.640 --> 36:43.120
Yeah, yeah. I know.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.440
In fact, I came by to tell you
that I'm not going to join you,

36:46.520 --> 36:48.760
because Oscarito's surgery is tomorrow.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.240
Yeah, I hope he's all right, you know.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.320
[Alex] Yeah.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.160
I'm just doing a little packing here.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.960
I wish you weren't leaving so soon.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.640
Yeah, well...

37:04.680 --> 37:07.480
...we better get out of town
before they change their minds.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.760
But don't worry. He'll, uh...

37:11.840 --> 37:13.360
He'll be in touch with you.

I don't want to rush you,
but we have to go.

the beached whale was a problem,

back to health, step by step.

and hard work by Greenpeace,

Unfortunately,
Hayden was double-booked.

She also had to be on  Letterman
and we have to respect that.

To me, socialism is about
everyone having equal opportunities.

he didn't have the same opportunities
as other whales.
