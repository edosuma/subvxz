-What?
-Oh, why?

00:32.075 --> 00:33.326
You already watched it today?

00:34.493 --> 00:36.705
Yes, Mother and I
watched it this morning.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.331
--Now it makes sense.

00:38.414 --> 00:41.167
Uh, I got something
that's kinda Perfect Storm-ish.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.336

I hope we're not too loud or anything.

01:23.877 --> 01:25.586
Not at all.
That's why I'm here, man.

01:25.670 --> 01:26.671

03:29.836 --> 03:31.129
Shaun is great.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.423
At every single party in our 20s,
she flashed her tits at some point.

03:34.507 --> 03:36.092
I'm assuming she has great tits.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.011
Legendary.
But she has a kid now,

03:38.094 --> 03:40.179
so I don't know
what kind of condition they're in.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.556
I was never a big titty flasher.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.269
Oh. I went through a brief phase
of that at college.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.229
Pretty much never had a top on.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.355
Hmm.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.859
Should I invite that guy, Gus?

03:52.942 --> 03:54.318
Why, you like him?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.738
No, but I feel like
he'd be fun at a party.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.531
Well, I'm excited to meet
some new people.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.574

04:03.369 --> 04:04.996
No, not at all.

04:06.039 --> 04:08.707
But we should get you some new friends
so that doesn't happen.

need to meet a guy.

to do it this morning.

07:55.226 --> 07:56.519
-Why didn't you just do it then...
-Hello?

07:56.602 --> 07:58.229
...like I asked, instead of making me
stressed out now?

07:58.312 --> 08:00.481
Because I'm the one
that went to Whole Foods.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.026

-Yes.

08:06.029 --> 08:07.905
There's still bird shit
all over the fucking patio chairs.

08:07.989 --> 08:09.282

to sit in them all night?

08:09.365 --> 08:10.574

08:19.667 --> 08:20.876
party.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.546
I think I'm just here
a little too early, right now, so...

08:23.629 --> 08:25.339
How many people did Mickey invite?

08:25.423 --> 08:28.634
This isn't the kind of thing
she can just invite a million people to.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.012
You know what, I--
I'm cool just to wait outside

08:31.095 --> 08:32.930
until the party gets going,
and then I'll get back in here.

08:33.014 --> 08:35.349
No, man, I'm sorry.
I mean, this was just a bad time.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.434
-Come in.
-Let me get you a drink.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.851
I'll get him a drink.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.562
You go hose off the patio furniture.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.480
You know what?
I can hose off the patio furniture.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.399
-Perfect. That's perfect.
-Oh, thank you.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.650
You're so sweet.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.527
-You are like a little angel.
-Okay.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.154
- Come on, Russ.
- Thank you.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.174
Did you get it?

09:08.257 --> 09:09.592
Yeah.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.884
Do you ever get these?

09:10.968 --> 09:12.095
Oh, yeah.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.888
They just keep coming.
I'm like The Fly.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.933
Like a sweet Australian fly.

09:40.831 --> 09:41.915
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.834
I'd love to hear a dubstep from Kurt.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.593
-Yes.
-Uh, Shaun?

09:52.676 --> 09:53.969
-Hey.
-Sorry to interrupt.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.180
Um, I was actually wondering
about Mickey.

09:56.264 --> 09:59.142
Is she, like,
usually a late person or...

09:59.225 --> 10:02.978
Um, like, she's normally either late
or she doesn't show up at all.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.231
So she's probably
not gonna come,

10:05.314 --> 10:07.608
'cause she hasn't come
to the last three things that I've had.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.653
Okay. Well, I think I might just
wait around here

10:10.736 --> 10:12.238
for a little while longer.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.948
Got a... got a pretty good feeling
she's on her way.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.784
--So she should be here any moment.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.786
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.522
It's a Band-Aid.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.983
That'll heal all your wounds,
inside and out.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.944
- Oh, thanks. It's beautiful.

10:59.702 --> 11:00.828
Hey, man.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.622
Hey, I'm Len.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.416
You wanna come
and tattoo something on me?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.835
Oh. No, I don't.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.337
You really want me to?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.796
It's my way of connecting with people.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.424
My tattoos represent where I've been,
who I've met.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.633
Come on in.
Give it a try.

11:14.717 --> 11:15.843
Oh.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.720
You know what?
That's actually, uh...

11:17.803 --> 11:19.263
It's pretty cool.
I like that.

11:19.347 --> 11:21.098
All right, let's do it.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.182
Okay.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.101
Mickey!

11:24.184 --> 11:25.353
- Oh, my God.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.104
Look at you.
You look so hot.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.147
You're like a fucking hot mama.

11:29.232 --> 11:30.441
Thank you.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.025
Oh. This is my roommate, Bertie.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.862
Hi. Thanks so much for inviting me.
Your house is gorgeous.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.490
Um, I love your accent.
Where are you from?

11:37.573 --> 11:40.409
Oh, she's from Australia,
and yes, she has hugged a koala.

11:40.493 --> 11:41.619
It's the first thing I asked her.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.371
Is there anywhere I may get a drink?

11:43.454 --> 11:44.705
Yes, there's a bar
set up in the kitchen--

11:44.788 --> 11:46.707
- Alcohol!

11:46.790 --> 11:47.791
I'm just joking.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.960
But I do really need a drink.
Nice to meet you.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.712
-Aw.
-I really like her.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.256
-She's cute.
-She's super cute.

11:53.339 --> 11:55.549
This is like a full-on grown-up's house.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.884
I know.
It's super weird, right?

11:56.967 --> 11:58.802
No, it's great.
I'm so proud of you.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.389
You've come such a long way
from that one-bedroom in North Hollywood.

12:01.472 --> 12:02.681
You remember those creepy guys next door

12:02.765 --> 12:04.433
who always tried to give us massages?

12:04.517 --> 12:05.643
Oh, God.
They were the worst.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.270
Mmm. Did I blow one of them?

12:07.353 --> 12:08.937
You definitely did.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.774
Oh! Some guy you invited is here.

12:11.857 --> 12:12.858
Oh, yeah, Gus.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.902
Yeah. Um, he was the first one here

12:14.985 --> 12:16.737
and Brian made him clean off
all of our patio furniture.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.864
-Aw.
-Is he your boyfriend?

12:18.947 --> 12:20.073
No. God, no.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.784
I just thought he'd be, like,
fun at the party.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.995
Uh, yeah.
Well, so far he's not.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.670
--All right. All done.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.838
-Done?
-All done, yeah.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.340
What do you think, huh?

12:37.383 --> 12:39.051
What's a sarcoma?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.512
Oh, you don't know?
Kind of ruins the joke.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.139
Uh, sarcoma's like a form of cancer.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.975
-Cancer?
-What? No.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.060
Not like cancer-cancer.

12:48.143 --> 12:51.104
It's, like, malignant tumors, usually,
like bone or muscle, or fat--

12:51.188 --> 12:52.773
That's fucking worse than cancer.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.358
What are you, a fucking idiot?

12:54.442 --> 12:56.402
-No. You told me--
-Are you fucking stupid?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.487
You put... you put fucking
cancer on my back?

12:58.571 --> 12:59.572
-You-- Not cancer--
-I should throw you

12:59.655 --> 13:00.781
through the fucking window.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.158
How about you get
the fuck away from me?

13:03.241 --> 13:05.285
-Len, you said do my personality...
-Get away from me.

13:05.369 --> 13:06.537
-...and that's my personality.
-Get...

13:06.620 --> 13:07.663
I'm a goofball, okay?

13:07.746 --> 13:09.247
You need to get the fuck
away from me.

13:09.332 --> 13:10.458
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.292
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Okay, you said...

13:12.376 --> 13:14.837
Well, don't tell somebody to write
anything if you don't mean it.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.921
Cancer?

13:16.004 --> 13:18.215
Great.
Yeah, it's on Little Santa Monica...

13:18.298 --> 13:19.967
- Cool.
- ...in Beverly Hills.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.051
Mickey?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.637
-Hey.
-Hmm. Gussy!

13:23.721 --> 13:25.348
- How's it going?
- How are you?

13:25.431 --> 13:28.016
-Good. I'm good.
-Oh, I'm so glad you showed.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.561
Yeah, it's good.
It should be a fun party. Huh?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.355
It's a Shaun party.
It's gonna be awesome.

13:32.438 --> 13:34.482
Oh, definitely.
We're gonna have a blast. Yeah.

13:34.565 --> 13:37.234
-Have you been here long?
-No. No, not too long.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.069
Really? She said you were
the first one here.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.071
She did?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.116
Oh, I ought to wring her neck.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.410
--Uh, no. Yeah, I was just, uh...

13:46.494 --> 13:48.161
I think I got the time wrong.
I don't know.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.372
I said 7:00.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.501
Right. Well, I guess, uh,
I thought you said 6:42.

13:53.584 --> 13:57.337
So, in my mind,
I was, like, totally, fashionably late.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.464
Can I get you a drink?

13:58.547 --> 14:00.340
I would...
Yeah, I'd love a drink.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.385
-You wanna go get one? Cool.
-Yeah, sure.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.554
Oh, my God.
Is that Dustin?

14:05.638 --> 14:07.473
That's my ex-boyfriend. Fuck.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.307
I gotta go say hi to him.
I'll be right back.

14:09.392 --> 14:10.893
Okay. Do what you have to do.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.352
And, uh...

14:13.896 --> 14:16.440
Shit. Shit. Fuck.

14:16.524 --> 14:19.402
Hey, Cori.
How's everything going over there?

14:19.485 --> 14:21.570
Good. It's just me and Chris.

14:21.654 --> 14:23.155
Uh, just cleanin' up.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.907
How is the party?

14:24.990 --> 14:27.410
Uh, it's kind of weird.

14:28.411 --> 14:32.373
Everybody here at this party looks like
a grown-up version of that movie Kids.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.875
Plus, Mickey showed up late
and then she, like,

14:34.958 --> 14:37.586
blew me off to go talk to an ex.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.922
And it's like, I just feel...

14:40.005 --> 14:42.340
really stupid right now.

14:42.425 --> 14:43.759
See if he has bread?

14:43.842 --> 14:45.218
Like, why did I come?

14:45.302 --> 14:47.888
Like, why did I shoot
my mouth off to everybody,

14:47.971 --> 14:49.390
like I was gonna make out with her?

14:49.473 --> 14:51.224
That's so fucking stupid.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.186
No one thought you guys were actually
gonna make out, anyway, right?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.439
It's just like... I feel like...

14:56.522 --> 14:59.107
I feel like she's sick of me already
or something, you know?

14:59.191 --> 15:00.859
It's like, this happens all the time.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.987
It's like, I meet somebody,
and then they like me initially,

15:04.071 --> 15:05.448
and then I just, like, fuck it up

15:05.531 --> 15:07.741
and they get tired of me
or something, you know?

15:07.825 --> 15:09.242
It's like, you know,

15:09.326 --> 15:13.038
you're, like, my only friend, who, like,
grew into liking me, seriously.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.289
That's not true.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.833
Okay, that's true.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.335
But you were like--
When I met you, you were like...

15:18.419 --> 15:20.128
- You were like...
- "Hi, I'm Gus.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.130
What's your major?"

15:22.214 --> 15:23.757
I didn't say that all the time.

15:23.841 --> 15:24.842
Yeah, you did.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.845
You always said that, and everyone
called you Major Gus behind your back.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.681
I thought you called me Major Gus,
like, you know...

15:30.764 --> 15:34.518
Like, in a David Bowie,
Major Tom way, like,

15:34.602 --> 15:38.439
"Ground control to Major Gus"
sort of thing.

15:38.522 --> 15:39.732
No.

15:41.484 --> 15:44.319
Uh. Sorry, occupied.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.946
Are you in the bathroom?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.405
No. Yeah. What?

15:47.490 --> 15:49.533
I think
I'm just gonna go home.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.660
It was, like, a huge mistake
coming here.

15:51.744 --> 15:52.828
Don't go home.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.872
You went all the way there
to talk to her,

15:54.955 --> 15:56.499
so why don't you
fucking talk to her?

15:56.582 --> 15:58.709
Why don't you be a man?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.169
Just be a man.
You're a man, aren't you?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.672
Okay. Yeah. All right.

16:03.756 --> 16:06.091
-Bye, Cori.
-Bye.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.556
You can do this, Gus.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.016
You're the man.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.810
You're... like a man.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.813
You're close to being a man.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.859
Fuck you,
you piece of shit.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.113
Hey.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.409
Um... that smell was in here
before I got in here.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.411
Yeah, you're the man.

16:34.495 --> 16:35.704
You heard me?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.040
Fuck you.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.252
Dustino.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.004
-Hey.
-Hey, no, where are you going?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.464
I haven't seen you in forever.
Let's hang out.

16:46.549 --> 16:47.675
Why would I wanna do that?

16:47.758 --> 16:50.468
I don't see you for years
and suddenly everything is just cool?

16:50.553 --> 16:52.763
What's the problem?
We said we were gonna be friends.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.431
Is that how you remember it?

16:54.515 --> 16:55.974
You were awful to me.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.267
No, I wasn't.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.811
You stole my laptop.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.063
Had my family photos on it.
I didn't have those backed up.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.566
Are you crazy?
I never stole your laptop.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.109
My couch has cigarette burns
all over it because of you.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.402
You could've burned down my house.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.572
I have dogs!
Did that ever occur to you?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.239
Okay. Okay.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.200
But who cares?
It was years ago.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.868
You destroy everything that you touch.

17:14.952 --> 17:17.955
I've spent thousands of dollars
on therapy because of you.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.957
Okay. Well, yeah,
you did shit to me, too.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.667
It's called being in a relationship.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.336
I didn't cheat on you.
You cheated on me, though, right?

17:24.419 --> 17:26.379
With Atwater Carl.
Big surprise.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.506
You fucking crazy?

17:28.591 --> 17:31.594
Carl was my best guy friend,
and you couldn't handle that,

17:31.677 --> 17:33.345
so you're making up
all this bullshit.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.557
Can you tell the truth,
one time, for once? Please?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.184
I am. I am. I swear on my life.

17:39.267 --> 17:44.147
I swear on fucking Shaun's baby's life
that I did not cheat on you with Carl.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.232
And you know what?

17:45.315 --> 17:47.400
I was really looking forward
to seeing you for one second

17:47.484 --> 17:49.194
until you started
with all this bullshit.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.071
Oh, my God. Just...
Whatever. Fuck off.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.564
Hey.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.734
Hey.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.444
You're that guy that tattooed Len
right after me, huh?

18:31.528 --> 18:33.571
I did, I did.
Did you see that?

18:33.656 --> 18:35.616
What happened?
Why'd he flip out?

18:35.699 --> 18:40.495
He had a mole on his back
and I tattooed "sarcoma" next to it.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.123
- That's amazing.
- He didn't like that, yeah.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.710
Oh, man. That dude needs
to lighten the fuck up, right?

18:46.794 --> 18:49.504
I mean, he's got a piece of pizza
tattooed on his chest.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.632
I know, right?
It's like, "Chill out, dude."

18:53.425 --> 18:55.052
What about you?
You got any tattoos?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.054
I do. Just this little guy.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.264
Oh. Right there.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.308
Yeah, what is that?
A moon, stars?

19:01.391 --> 19:03.143
-Something like that.
-Yeah.

19:03.226 --> 19:06.104
Get some horseshoes, clovers,
you got all the Lucky Charms, right?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.480
--Oh, yeah.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.858
You've probably heard that,
like, five billion times, yeah?

19:09.942 --> 19:11.735
How about you?
You have any?

19:11.819 --> 19:14.196
Tattoos? Uh, no.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.741
I'm not really, uh, the kind of guy
who could pull off a tattoo, you know?

19:17.825 --> 19:20.160
-Like earrings, ball caps, tattoos.
-You could pull it off.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.578
-None of that.
-You could pull off some tats--

19:21.662 --> 19:23.121
Like, just some sleeves.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.331
Oh, some sleeves over here.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.333
Or, like, just, like,
"fuck" across your throat.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.626
- Oh. Yeah, maybe.

19:28.711 --> 19:29.962
Maybe, I'll, uh...

19:30.045 --> 19:31.839
I could get one of those,
like, teardrop tattoos

19:31.922 --> 19:33.131
for every person I've killed.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.925
- That'd be good.
- And I've killed a lot.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.135
So, I'd have, like,
12 teardrops on my cheek.

19:37.219 --> 19:40.597
Or, like, a little swastika
or something on your...

19:40.681 --> 19:42.683
- Maybe. What?
- Oh!

19:42.766 --> 19:44.852
-What?
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.103
Why?
Do you think I'm Jewish?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.105
Every-- That's okay,
everybody thinks I'm Jewish.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.606
I'm not, so I don't care.

19:49.690 --> 19:50.733
-No way.
-Yeah.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.275
I mean, I do care.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.362
I'm a non-Jewish person
who cares about swastikas.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.115
Why don't I go grab a drink

19:58.198 --> 20:00.868
and think up some cooler tattoo ideas?

20:00.951 --> 20:02.828
- Some non-swastika tattoos.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.954
Yeah, that'd be good.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.455
-And come find you.
-Yeah, yeah.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.623
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.125
-I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.835
Good. See you around.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.067
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.527
Is this cool? Sorry.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.653
You play?

20:36.737 --> 20:39.697
-Uh, not well. No.
-Me, neither.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.076
Actually, I'm pretty good.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.327
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.788
Where's my fucking amp?

20:45.871 --> 20:48.581
I mean, at Jeffrey
and my record label alone...

20:48.665 --> 20:50.333
I mean, we've had, like,
what, four bosses

20:50.417 --> 20:51.543
-in the past five years?
-Yeah.

20:51.626 --> 20:55.255
Four? That must be so confusing.
How do you guys keep track of them?

20:55.338 --> 20:56.673
Um...
This is bullshit.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.300
-Why are we talking about this?
-No, it's not.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.802
It think it's kind of fascinating

20:59.885 --> 21:01.719
- from a sociological standpoint.
- Really?

21:01.804 --> 21:04.139
Yeah, okay. What do you do?

21:04.222 --> 21:06.308
I work in, uh,
focus group research.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.268
- I moderate focus groups.
- That's awesome.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.519
Oh, for, like, movies or...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.230
Yeah, uh, sometimes for movies,
mainly for food.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.857
Okay,
so you get, like, people to tell you,

21:13.941 --> 21:15.358
like, what chips are the crunchiest?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.527
Yes, very perceptive, Jeffrey.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.237
-Give us your spiel. Let's see this.
-Oh, okay, uh...

21:19.321 --> 21:21.990
I'd bring everyone into the room
with all the brands,

21:22.074 --> 21:23.992
but then I would
turn the labels away from you

21:24.076 --> 21:25.786
- so you're not prejudiced.
- Sure.

21:25.869 --> 21:26.912
And then I'd be like,

21:26.995 --> 21:29.706
"So, okay, which tequila
tastes best?"

21:29.790 --> 21:31.208
First, try number one.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.211
Drink.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.254
-Okay.
-All right, we're doing this, I guess.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.132
Now try number two.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.095
Mmm.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.847
It's... It's one.
It's so clear.

21:44.972 --> 21:45.973
-Yeah, I'm one as well.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.599
Now let's try number three.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.434
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.899
Um, it's one.
I have to stay loyal.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.400
No. No, it's three for me.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.069
Three? I love it.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.904
So then I'd ask you some
follow-up questions

22:00.988 --> 22:02.155
about how three makes you feel.

22:02.239 --> 22:03.698
So, like, does, uh,

22:03.781 --> 22:07.202
three make you feel like you might do
something you might regret later on?

22:07.285 --> 22:09.872
Like, something you
wouldn't normally do

22:09.955 --> 22:12.457
in a party full of people
with just someone,

22:12.540 --> 22:14.334
- maybe, who you just met?
- Uh-huh.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.418
Yeah, I think I might.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.880
I think I might
do something crazy tonight.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.464
- That's great.
- Yeah.

You're here?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.951
This party is like The Christmas Carol.
Every guy I've ever dated is here.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.661
That's probably
why it's so crowded.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.456
I'm kidding.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.834
What are you doing here?
Did Shaun invite you?

24:19.917 --> 24:23.505
No, she Instagrammed a picture of it,
and I saw you in the background.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.715
And, uh, I wanted to talk to you, so...

24:25.798 --> 24:27.925
Save your breath,
I'm not joining Bliss House.

24:28.010 --> 24:30.345
I'm over that nonsense, all right?
That's... that's done.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.554
That was...

24:31.638 --> 24:35.308
That was me trying to fill
this God-sized hole that I had.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.435
But then I realized it's not God.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.354
It was... It's a Mickey-sized hole.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.064
Oh, brother.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.984
How long is this fucking jam session
gonna go on?

24:45.068 --> 24:46.611
You know, I'm sober.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.323
Quit drinking. I stopped.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.159
Good for you, okay? Bye.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.244
-All right, okay, wait.
-What?

24:54.327 --> 24:55.537
What about you?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.539
-You're not sober.
-I'm in AA.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.042
You're drinking wine
straight out of the bottle right now.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.501
You know what?
I'm on my own path.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.586
You worry about your journey,
I'll worry about mine.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.505
Okay, uh... I just...

25:07.549 --> 25:09.967
-I want to make love to you sober.
-What?

25:10.052 --> 25:12.554
I love you,
and I miss you.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.765
And I'm doing this for us.
I'm doing this for you.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.225
You're doing this for me?

25:17.309 --> 25:18.476
You don't even fucking know me.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.521
You just wanna fuck me
and then go to your mom's house.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.939
You know what?
You're this...

25:23.022 --> 25:26.318
Oh, you're this cute,
pixie, little nice woman,

25:26.401 --> 25:27.402
but you know what?

25:27.485 --> 25:28.736
You're a fucking bitch.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.406
Here's an idea.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

25:31.489 --> 25:33.575
- Hmm?
- Hey, Mickey. Guess what?

25:33.658 --> 25:35.452
Atwater Carl confirms.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.414
We fucked! What are you talk--
We fucked, like, three times.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.499
-God, all right.
-You know we did, Mick.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.000
By the way,
you look super-hot.

25:43.085 --> 25:44.252
Fuck you, Carl.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.503
-What's the matter?
-Fuck you!

25:45.587 --> 25:47.380
-He's telling the truth.
-Go away!

25:47.464 --> 25:48.506
-Go away!
-What's going on here?

25:48.590 --> 25:50.633
-Are we, uh, destroying another soul?
-Get the fuck out of here.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.510
-Why are you talking to this whore?
-Don't call her a whore.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.429
-I love her.
-Hey, buddy, I don't know you, okay?

25:54.512 --> 25:55.888
But I guarantee you
she's cheated on you.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.390
What's your fuckin' problem?

25:57.474 --> 25:59.892
What's my fuckin' problem?
She is my fuckin' problem.

25:59.976 --> 26:01.978
Well, you're my fucking
problem now, dude.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.273
So would you recommend this tequila,
or would you highly--

26:05.357 --> 26:08.193
Highly recommend this tequila.
Yeah.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.653
And, like, if an orgy
were to break out,

26:10.737 --> 26:13.781
would you like for that
to be a large-sized orgy

26:13.865 --> 26:16.784
or like, just like,
a nice, mid-sized orgy?

26:16.868 --> 26:18.745
Nice, mid-sized. Yeah.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.913
You're really cute
when you're drunk, you know?

26:20.997 --> 26:23.125
Obviously, I've never
seen you not drunk, but...

26:23.208 --> 26:24.292
You're pretty cute, too.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.169
I'm sorry.
What's going on?

26:27.254 --> 26:28.963
Are you pretending to be straight?

26:29.046 --> 26:31.174
Because you weren't pretending
to be straight last night.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.717
Oh, my God.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.427
What's happening?

26:34.511 --> 26:36.012
Oh, my God.
Fuck you, Daniel.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.972
You know,
sexuality's a spectrum, okay?

26:38.055 --> 26:39.974
-And we're not a couple. So...
-And you're here.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.644
I'm outta here.
Fuck you, man.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.564
- Where's he going?
- Fuck.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.691
Sorry.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.319
I don't mind that he has sex with boys.

26:51.403 --> 26:53.655
Mmm, I don't mind, either.

26:53.738 --> 26:54.989
Fuck you.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.408
-I'm trying to fucking help you.
-Dude!

26:56.491 --> 26:57.867
- Dude, stop it!
- Fucking help me.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.452
You guys are acting like idiots.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.454
-Just fucking-- Just admit it, Mickey.
-Okay, fine!

27:01.538 --> 27:03.415
I fucked around on you.
But guess what?

27:03.498 --> 27:05.417
There are bigger deals
than cheating on your boyfriend

27:05.500 --> 27:07.544
-when you're 28 years old!
-You know what troubles me?

27:07.627 --> 27:10.588
Is that you swore on a baby's life
that you were telling the truth.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.006
I told you she's a fucking whore!

27:12.089 --> 27:13.800
I told you not to call her that!

27:13.883 --> 27:15.760
Fine, punch each other.
I don't give a fuck.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.970
--Oh, shit!

27:18.054 --> 27:19.806
It's like his thumb
went right in my eye.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.266
I didn't think
that was gonna happen.

27:21.349 --> 27:24.394
If anything, I thought you were
gonna beat the shit out of him.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.771
And thank you for defending my honor.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.648
I am the one that called you a whore!

27:29.316 --> 27:31.193
You know what?
Fuck you, and fuck you, too.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.361
I can't believe I fucked
either one of you.

Boo!

28:10.482 --> 28:11.858
Mickey, maybe we should head home now.

28:11.941 --> 28:15.695
No. This-- We need to be fuckin'
wild and free, right, guys?

28:15.778 --> 28:17.239
Don't you remember?

28:17.322 --> 28:19.407
The night... the night that
fuckin' Elliott Smith died,

28:19.491 --> 28:21.784
Shaun and I did crack
and then we went and we banged

28:21.868 --> 28:23.661
on everybody's doors
and told them about it.

28:23.745 --> 28:24.871
That was a fuckin' night.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.540
Come on! What the fuck?
You're sitting on the floor.

28:27.624 --> 28:30.084
Let's go in there in the pool.
Let's go fucking christen the pool.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.294
Let's do it! Fuck!

28:31.378 --> 28:33.170
Christen the pool!

28:33.255 --> 28:35.172
Come on!
Alexis, get in the pool.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.716
I can't.
I have my phone on me.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.218
-Get in the fuckin' pool.
-Hey, not a great idea.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.262
It's cold out
and the pool's not heated yet.

28:40.345 --> 28:41.554
What? Who cares?

28:41.638 --> 28:43.598
We once pissed in your mouth
in Palm Springs

28:43.681 --> 28:45.475
because Shaun and I dared you.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.101
Can you please stop
bringing that up?

28:47.184 --> 28:49.479
By this time of night,
we'd all be hookin' up with each other.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.689
The least we can do
is get in the pool.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.024
Like, come on.
Let's make shit happen.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.942
Fuck the police!

28:56.068 --> 28:57.445
- Yes!

28:57.529 --> 28:59.656
Yes! Dude, it is on!

28:59.739 --> 29:01.241
Shaun, get your tits out.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.742
Please don't.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.577
Whoo!

29:14.379 --> 29:15.963
--Whoa!

29:21.969 --> 29:24.514
We're not dead yet, fuckers!

29:27.559 --> 29:29.561
--Shit.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.775
-I can't... breathe!
-It's okay.

29:35.858 --> 29:37.109
- It's okay.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.236
- It's all right.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.325
-It's... like...
-It's all right.

29:43.408 --> 29:47.704
It's like somebody
body-slammed my stomach.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.790
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.419
Okay.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.795
It's getting better.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.924
Yeah, see?
Everything's okay.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.930
I just...
I just wanted to have fun.

30:06.013 --> 30:09.058
Aw. And you did have fun.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.852
You just got, um, you know...

30:10.935 --> 30:12.895
- super injured.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.321
Are you all right?

30:21.404 --> 30:24.073
You really smashed into the water.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.158
-Yeah. Aw.
-I'll take care of you.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.536
-Hi, Gus.
-Hey, Bertie.

30:32.123 --> 30:35.335
You guys are like my parents,
but... nicer.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.087
Hey, you know what?

30:39.922 --> 30:43.885
You are the nicest, sweetest,
most caring people I know.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.720
You guys should go on a date.

30:46.429 --> 30:49.724
You would make
such a good couple.

30:51.225 --> 30:52.226
- Mmm...
- Uh...
