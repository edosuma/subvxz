WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:09.968
(elevator bell dings)

00:19.936 --> 00:23.565
Hey, how you doin'? Frankie Cox.
Looking for a guy named Alan Shore.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.233
I think he works here in litigation.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.402
-Hey, how you doing?
-Do you have an appointment?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.779
No, I'm a walk-up,
but I'm an attorney myself.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.948
So, you know,
professional courtesy and all.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.284
There's my card. Hey, how you doing?

00:34.367 --> 00:36.244
RECEPTIONIST:
Um, may I tell him what it's regarding?

00:36.327 --> 00:39.998
You may if privilege extends
to receptionists here.

00:40.081 --> 00:44.586
-I would have to tell him something, sir.
-Okay. I killed somebody.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.880
That work for you?

00:51.301 --> 00:55.555
I didn't kill anybody.
I just, uh... well, I embellished.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.892
Try to get myself in the door a little.
You know what I'm saying.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.936
You're a busy guy.
I figured, "Hey, make it good."

01:02.020 --> 01:04.147
-Well, homicide's a dandy.
-(chuckles)

01:04.230 --> 01:08.777
What's the real reason
you're taking up my... busy time?

01:08.860 --> 01:09.819
Well... (clears throat)

01:09.903 --> 01:12.906
it is homicide, actually,
but, uh, I didn't do it.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.450
-My brother did.
-Your brother did?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.202
Yeah, he killed his wife.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.622
But if you know him, you'd be shocked,
because he's a very principled guy.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.249
I'm the black sheep.
Anyway, he killed her.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.211
Uh, he bought murder two.
He's doing eight to 20 at Cedars.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.754
He's already done five. The thing is,

01:27.837 --> 01:30.715
I tried to help him cover it up
so he wouldn't get caught.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.259
Obviously, not my best work
since he got convicted.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.304
So anywho, Neill. Uh, that's my brother.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.473
He came up for a parole hearing
a month ago

01:38.556 --> 01:40.058
where he had to tell the whole truth,

01:40.141 --> 01:42.560
which my involvement
was a part of that truth,

01:42.644 --> 01:45.647
so now the cops do have a case against me.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.732
And I'm on the hook
for obstruction of justice,

01:47.816 --> 01:49.776
concealing evidence and, you know...
(clears throat)

01:49.859 --> 01:53.780
...a laundry list of...
lesser charges, whatever.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.948
-Can I smoke?
-No.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.120
So, now I'm facing 15 years myself.
Your name come up.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.789
That's why I'm here, taking a shot.

02:02.872 --> 02:06.751
And if I were to represent you,
what exactly would be our defense?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.546
(inhales) I don't know. Uh...

02:09.712 --> 02:11.381
(snaps fingers) Brotherly love.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.591
(stammers)
They founded a nation on that idea, right?

02:13.675 --> 02:16.052
Or at least Philadelphia! (laughs)

02:18.888 --> 02:23.143
As you can plainly see, I got personality.
I testify good. Jurors love me.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.229
-You've been on trial before?
-Little stuff, nothing big like this.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.858
Pretty please?

02:29.941 --> 02:34.529

-Brad.
-Hey, Paul. What's up?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.767
I need you to read this, sign it.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.936
Get it back to me
by the end of the day, please.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.771
-What is it?
-It's a love contract.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.149
-A what?
-A love contract.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.569
Basically, it's a document
to limit our liability

03:14.652 --> 03:17.238
-when good relationships go bad.
-Excuse me?

03:17.322 --> 03:21.034
More and more corporations are using them
as sexual harassment shields.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.996
You and Denise are romantically
or physically involved,

03:25.079 --> 03:26.706
which is very nice.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.584
But should it turn ugly,
we need to protect ourselves.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.752
You gotta be kidding me.

03:31.211 --> 03:35.548
-Brad, I know it's silly, but it's policy.
-BRAD: I don't care.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.426
-The policy is dumb, and I won't sign it.
-You have to sign.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.429
I won't. A love contract?
Are you kidding me, Paul?

03:41.971 --> 03:43.932
Do you know how many billions of dollars

03:44.015 --> 03:47.393
are paid out on sexual harassment
claims every year?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.354
Did Shore sign one? Denny?

03:49.437 --> 03:53.274
We only require it of those who have
disclosed an interoffice relationship.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.693
I'm not signing it. Forget it. It's dumb.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.365
The managing partners
unanimously agreed on this policy.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.450
Paul, you can't validate stupidity
by unanimous consent.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.576
I don't think you understand.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.413
Failure to sign is grounds
for termination of employment.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.331
This is getting dumber and dumber.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.667
-If you do not sign, you will be fired.
-I'm a partner.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.918
-I don't care.
-I'm not signing it.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.419
You're not hearing me, Brad!

04:13.503 --> 04:14.963
I'm hearing you,
but you're not hearing me.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.507
I am not signing this ridiculous document.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.639
-You're fired.
-What? I'm a partner.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.976
You're fired, partner.

04:39.904 --> 04:40.738
You fired him?

04:40.822 --> 04:44.826
I had to. He just defied me,
defied the entire partnership.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.120
-So you just fired him?
-He forced my hand.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.747
-I'm telling you, I had no choice.
-Well, of course you did.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.208
You decide either to do it or not do it.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.419
And had I not? What authority would I--

04:54.502 --> 04:57.964
Paul, Brad's a partner,
a pretty beloved one by a lot of people.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.049
You-you don't think
this is a bit draconian?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.969
No. He was flat-out insubordinate.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.181
Look, I adore him, too,
but there is a rank and file here.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.937
I'd like to be able to tell him
that if he signs the contract,

05:13.021 --> 05:14.689
he won't be fired. Can I do that?

05:16.357 --> 05:20.153
Fine. But I need you
to back me up here, Shirley.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.117
-(knocking on door)
-Denny, I...

05:28.453 --> 05:30.955
What are you doing? Denny?

05:33.374 --> 05:35.376
-What are you doing?
-Secret.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.671
Certainly you can tell me.
I'm your flamingo.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.591
No, no, no, <i>The Secret.</i> Haven't you heard?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.800
-The law of attraction.
-Ah.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.094
-Get with the program, man.
-What are you talking about?

05:45.178 --> 05:49.057
(sighs) If you think positively,
you become a magnet

05:49.140 --> 05:51.351
and pull in everything you want
towards you.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.771
-Really?
-I figure if I concentrate on world peace,

05:54.854 --> 05:56.397
maybe I can actually make it happen.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.483
You're sitting here concentrating
on world peace?

05:58.566 --> 06:02.362
Oh, God, no. Gotta start smaller.
I'm thinking Raquel Welch.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.323
-Get her first, then go for peace.
-Yes.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.076
In the meantime,
how about trying a case with me?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.912
I've got a guy charged with trying to help
his brother get away with murder.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.789
-Is he guilty?
-Hundred percent.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.749
Count me in.
But if Raquel Welch shows up--

06:14.832 --> 06:15.917
You have an out.

06:25.676 --> 06:29.430
I-I don't want the complaint
actually filed. Just have it ready.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.433
I plan to attach it to the demand letter
so they know we're serious.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.935
A straight drip, please.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.229
I did review it. It's ready.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.356
You just need to print it out,

06:38.439 --> 06:40.942
and I will sign it when I get in,
so have a messenger...

06:47.782 --> 06:49.283
-(giggles)
-BARISTA: Two and ten please.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.911
-Ma'am?
-What?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.416
Oh, um... uh, thanks.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.592
I'll sue him.
He can't just unilaterally fire me.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.886
Brad, all he has to do
is get partnership approval and--

07:08.970 --> 07:10.763
I'll sue them all.
Talk about a wrongful termination.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.058
The grounds is my refusal to sign
a love contract? Would you sign that?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.601
-Well, I did.
-What?

07:15.685 --> 07:18.938
Brad, they're becoming boilerplate
in almost every major company.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.982
-Which is even more insane.
-SHIRLEY: Really?

07:21.065 --> 07:23.317
Insanity would be settling
sexual harassment claims

07:23.401 --> 07:25.069
to the tune of high six figures
every year.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.028
Come on, Shirley.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.906
Moreover, you've backed Paul
into a corner.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.201
That's just bad lawyering.
Maybe we should fire you for that.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.996
(chuckles)
Don't think you're bigger than us, Brad.

07:35.079 --> 07:38.916
Everybody's expendable,
even though with Jeffrey Coho's departure,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.420
we know full well we're down
to our last Buzz Lightyear.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.426
Sign the document
or clean out your office.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.938
DETECTIVE: We knew almost immediately
the crime scene had been staged.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.648
-How so?
-Well, the victim had died

08:02.732 --> 08:04.775
from a blow to the back of the head.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.445
The suspect maintained
it was self-defense.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.406
A knife conveniently lay
at the floor next to the victim.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.951
It had her prints on it.
And yet, portions of it had been wiped,

08:14.118 --> 08:16.871
probably the parts that had the suspect's
prints or the defendant's.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.414
-Objection.
-Overruled.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.210
I could be wrong, Judge,
but when a witness says "probably,"

08:22.293 --> 08:24.462
that's usually a sign
that speculation is implied.

08:24.545 --> 08:29.800
I know that! You don't have to object to
every little thing that's objectionable.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.011
I know what to ignore.

08:32.094 --> 08:36.349
I see. And not to be a nuisance,
but how would the jury know to ignore it?

08:37.391 --> 08:39.227
-Sustained.
-There we go.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.230
-Detective?
-As I was saying,

08:42.313 --> 08:44.357
the whole thing looked staged,

08:44.440 --> 08:46.651
meticulously so,
like he got help from a lawyer.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.486
-Objection.
-But we couldn't prove it.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.239
Then the brother testified
before the parole board.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.158
He admitted that they restaged
the entire crime scene

08:54.242 --> 08:55.701
to make it look like self-defense.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.454
He further said
that it was all the defendant's idea.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.831
And he said that everything
the defendant had told us

09:00.915 --> 09:03.584
when we got to the crime scene
was a complete lie.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.212
So now we got proof.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.631
Thank you, Detective.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.717
Your witness.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.891
Totally beatable, right?

09:20.434 --> 09:21.644
(whispers) Sic 'em, Fido!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.241
-(taps on door) Hello.
-Hello.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.451
I was wondering whether you'd like
to get lunch.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.038
Oh. No.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.376
Anything else?

09:48.838 --> 09:49.714
What-what's the matter?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.096
Clarence, this is not working out.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.350
-What-what's not working out?
-Us.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.604
It's great in many ways,

10:04.687 --> 10:09.734
but... well, when I, um,
consider long-term, it--

10:09.817 --> 10:10.651
I just don't see it.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.571
So I was thinking
maybe we should take a break.

10:15.615 --> 10:20.286
Oh, uh... okay.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.750
Can we, um, talk later?

10:25.833 --> 10:28.669
Because I really need
to get these documents filed.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.588
Uh, o-okay.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.382
(thuds)

10:36.552 --> 10:39.263
Oh, come on. Clarence!

10:40.931 --> 10:43.351
And who's idea was it, sir,
to stage the scene

10:43.434 --> 10:45.519
to make it look
like your wife attacked you?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.981
-Well--
-I remind you, sir, you're under oath.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.068
It-it was Frankie's.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.946
-JOHN: Frankie's idea to plant the knife?
-Yeah.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.658
What do you mean "no defense?"

10:58.741 --> 10:59.575
-Are you kidding me?
-Frank.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.620
I'm tellin' ya, brotherly love
Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell.

11:02.703 --> 11:03.996
Make it work for ya!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.248
-What are your thoughts, big guy?
-Raquel Welch.

11:06.874 --> 11:10.086
Look, Frank, I thought maybe we could poke
some holes on the elements,

11:10.169 --> 11:13.172
-but ultimately, we have no defense.
-Go with <i>The Secret.</i>

11:13.255 --> 11:15.925
I don't think Raquel Welch
is coming to our rescue.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.635
Brotherly love, like he said.

11:17.718 --> 11:18.594
-That's not a defense.
-DENNY: Make it one.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.638
Are we not our brother's keeper?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.557
-Cain and Abel. Read the bible, man.
-Cain killed Abel.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.686
Whatever. Coen brothers.
Go with them. They're hot.

11:26.769 --> 11:31.315
<i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>
The jury will suck it up. Denny Crane.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
I've got to have your brother
describe for the jury

11:34.318 --> 11:37.363
-how and why he killed his wife.
-What good would that do?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.199
You helped a murderer, Frank.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.744
Before I can get them to forgive you,
I need them to forgive the murderer.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.335
-CLAIRE: Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes.

11:53.129 --> 11:53.963
No.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.468
-Why?
-I told you.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.138
It's just--
I don't think it's meant to be.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.932
You're covering.
I know when you're covering.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.395
What's going on, Claire?

12:12.398 --> 12:16.444
I saw you this morning
in the coffee shop with that woman.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.160
-Oh.
-"Oh?" Well, that clears it up.

12:25.286 --> 12:29.582
You picked the wrong girl to cheat on,
Clarence. Zero tolerance.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.375
-It wasn't me.
-It wasn't you?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.377
-It was Clevant.
-Okay, you know what? (chuckles)

12:33.461 --> 12:36.797
I really don't care. Because I expect
loyalty from the whole team.

12:36.881 --> 12:41.260
Clarice, Clevant, Oprah, if any of them
are seeing other women, I'm out.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.553
Claire, Claire!

12:44.472 --> 12:47.892
-Please.
-Clarence, I can't do it.

12:48.893 --> 12:53.355
I don't mean to punish you, but... (sighs)

12:53.731 --> 12:56.400
I am not strong enough, okay?

13:00.029 --> 13:04.450
I can't do it. Now you need to leave.

13:06.076 --> 13:06.911
Please leave.

13:29.642 --> 13:34.146
I don't see any boxes,
so I assume you have a signed document.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.024
I do, actually.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.693
This is a notice of appeal,

13:39.777 --> 13:41.654
which I'm entitled to file
with the managing partners,

13:41.737 --> 13:45.366
requesting a full hearing.
Assemble the ranks, Shirley.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.452
Brad, you can't win this.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.704
I'm either going to win it here
or in court later.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.540
It's cheaper for you if I win it here.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.211
I'm concerned. Not all of my ideas work.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.923
Well, yours is the only one we've got.
It's brotherly love, full speed ahead.

14:01.006 --> 14:04.093
Just as long as we're clear,
this is your case.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.011
We lose, I'm still undefeated.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.807
Clarice, where's Clarence?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.351
Vacation. I'm just filling in.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.687
-Where did he go?
-Bora Bora.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.815
Any aging sex symbols show up
looking for me?

14:18.148 --> 14:21.235
-I wouldn't know.
-Clarice, may I have a word?

14:21.318 --> 14:25.114
-Take two. I'm busy.
-In my office, please.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.414
-What's going on?
-I told you. Clarence took some time.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.791
-I'm temping.
-Clarice, what's going on with Clarence?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
-I don't--
-And don't tell me you don't know. You do.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.336
What's happened?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.007
He got dumped.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.427
-Dumped?
-Yes, dumped.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.180
-By that bitch.
-Claire? Why?

14:50.264 --> 14:53.267
Because she saw Clevant
with another woman.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.477
What was Clevant doing with another woman?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.524
He was with an escort.

15:01.942 --> 15:07.448
-An escort? Call girl?
-Yes. Clarence is afraid of intimacy.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.409
He thought maybe he could get
more comfortable

15:10.492 --> 15:12.036
if Clevant just hung out with...

15:12.828 --> 15:17.541
Not for sex,
but just maybe simple affection,

15:17.625 --> 15:20.586
some surrogate nonsense. Stupid.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.005
-Does Claire know this?
-No.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.841
-I would like to talk to Clarence, please.
-No.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.720
-I really--
-Clarence is gone. Just forget Clarence!

15:30.054 --> 15:30.888
He's gone.

15:46.403 --> 15:50.157
-An escort?
-As some sort of surrogate.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.618
They weren't having sex. They were just...

15:54.036 --> 15:58.916
Clarence is trying to work on
his intimacy issues through Clevant.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.546
(sighs)
It's not that I don't forgive him, Alan.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.965
I know what I'm dealing with.

16:07.967 --> 16:12.221
-But?
-I just don't think I can deal.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.350
You know, I am not as rock-solid
as everybody cracks me up to be,

16:16.433 --> 16:22.147
and I think I need to protect myself
before I... love him.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.067
Claire, you already love him.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.657
-At least talk to him.
-Who, Clarence?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.410
He's not even reachable.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.122
I mean, Clarence has left the building,
which is what he does whenever...

16:40.416 --> 16:44.503
Look, I am not going through
Clevant or Clarice or Oprah.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.715
I am not going to be with a man
I can't get in a room with.

16:54.054 --> 16:57.099
BRAD: Well, suppose a person were gay,
in the closet.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.350
Suddenly, under company policy,

16:58.434 --> 17:00.686
it's his duty to declare
his sexual orientation?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.938
That's it? You're gay?

17:03.147 --> 17:05.733
Very classy, Paul,
trying to exploit my homophobia.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.902
But in this country,
we have a fundamental right to privacy,

17:08.986 --> 17:12.156
and as a legal principle, one would
expect it to be observed by a law firm.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.743
I have a right to my private life.
It's not subject to your jurisdiction,

17:15.826 --> 17:18.037
and if you're so afraid of exposure
to harassment claims,

17:18.120 --> 17:20.456
just have the lawyer sign
indemnity agreements.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.043
But the-the idea of a love contract
is just stupid.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.713
The very idea undermines
our credibility as attorneys.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.341
We're grown-ups. For God's sake.

17:37.931 --> 17:43.103
The right to privacy loses some of
its luster once we start getting sued

17:43.187 --> 17:47.775
for the private acts of employees.
If we are to be held accountable,

17:47.858 --> 17:51.445
we have to at least be apprised
of what is going on.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.739
Oh, balls.
That will just incur more exposure.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.908
-Better not to have notice.
-May I finish?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.534
What if it is adultery,

17:57.618 --> 18:00.496
and the victimized spouse
sues us for enabling?

18:00.579 --> 18:02.581
-Why create the paper trail?
-May I finish?

18:02.664 --> 18:05.793
This policy isn't to give you notice.
It's to chill relationships,

18:05.876 --> 18:09.004
-just nip them in their romantic bud.
-Let me speak.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.965
Do you farts have any idea how hard it is
for someone who is single,

18:12.049 --> 18:13.801
who works 60 hours a week to meet someone?

18:14.051 --> 18:15.511
The deck is already stacked against us

18:15.594 --> 18:18.055
without you piling on
these oppressive contracts!

18:18.138 --> 18:20.265
-Brad!
-I am sick and tired of being lonely!

18:26.772 --> 18:27.731
Aren't you?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.945
What if Denise,
instead of signing this contract,

18:33.028 --> 18:35.197
she decided to just sever?

18:35.989 --> 18:38.325
She's worried enough about
making partner as it is.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.245
I am sick of being lonely.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.622
You can all go to hell,
and you don't own me!

18:45.791 --> 18:46.959
And another thing,

18:47.042 --> 18:48.710
there's so much sleeping around
that goes on in this firm,

18:48.794 --> 18:50.212
you're gonna have to hire
a whole army of lawyers

18:50.295 --> 18:52.214
just to draft the contracts!

18:58.178 --> 18:59.346
He seemed upset.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.695
I was in a very... difficult marriage.

19:15.487 --> 19:19.533
I was often verbally abused,
extremely subordinated.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.829
I'm sure it speaks to my own character,
as well as that of my late wife's.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.208
And your wife became late
after you hit her

19:28.292 --> 19:30.002
on the back of the head
with a rolling pin?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.004
Yes.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.716
Mr. Cox, we've heard what happened
after you hit her.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.302
Could you please tell us
what happened leading up to it?

19:38.385 --> 19:41.013
Well, uh, we were having dinner.

19:42.723 --> 19:47.436
I had finally summoned the strength
to leave her, or so I thought.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.606
We were sitting in the kitchen.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.275
What's wrong with you?

19:55.903 --> 19:58.030
-Nothing.
-LYNNIE: Why are you so damn quiet?

19:58.822 --> 20:01.116
Usually you blabber on,
albeit about nothing.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.243
Bad day at work?

20:03.327 --> 20:06.079
Spill the boss' coffee
while you were fetching it like a dog?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.379
Lynnie, I think we've reached
a point where...

20:15.505 --> 20:16.506
where you and I...

20:20.761 --> 20:24.598
need to... redo the living room.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.059
I just chickened out.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.979
That might have been the end of it, but...

20:31.063 --> 20:33.732
Redo the living room?
What is wrong with you?

20:34.066 --> 20:37.361
Lynnie, I was just thinking.
We've done the kitchen, bathroom.

20:37.986 --> 20:42.866
We had the roof redone last year,
but the house never changes, does it?

20:43.867 --> 20:47.412
It remains... (stammers)
my little destination of failure,

20:48.205 --> 20:50.207
where I get to drive home to every night

20:50.290 --> 20:52.501
to hear about
how I'm not good enough or...

20:52.834 --> 20:55.587
-or-or how I don't measure up or--
-You mean, you don't hear it at work?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.343
-I hate you.
-(clicks tongue) That's nice, Neill.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.850
I almost lost the nerve again,
but I refused to.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.480
It's over.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.066
-(utensil clinking)
-What's over?

21:16.149 --> 21:20.320
Us, we're over. I want out.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.447
Where are you gonna go, Neill?

21:23.073 --> 21:27.035
The only life you have is the one
I've managed to manufacture for you,

21:27.119 --> 21:28.745
-and you know it.
-I'm leaving.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.873
You really think you're strong enough
to live without me?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.875
-(voice echoes) To live without me.
-Yes.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.381
Then the abuse started to escalate.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.385
I remember getting up,
moving away from the table.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.595
But she wouldn't let up.

21:46.305 --> 21:50.142
She was so... punishing.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.187
Here's what you probably
didn't think through.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.899
Remember how years ago
I was screwing your boss?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.193
Well, it seems I didn't stop.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.905
-(shudders)
-Upside, he and I still have a dialogue.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.866
If I tell him to fire you,

22:06.616 --> 22:10.620
gee, there's something we could have
in common. He can screw both of us.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.790
That's when I just reached
for the rolling pin.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.630
I don't remember
actually deciding to swing it.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.466
(voice echoes) He can screw both of us.

22:22.549 --> 22:26.053
NEILL: <i>She turned her head away,</i>
<i>and I struck her near the back,</i>

22:28.597 --> 22:30.015
<i>and then she started falling.</i>

22:34.561 --> 22:39.983
<i>The next thing, she was lying</i>
<i>on the floor and blood was coming out.</i>

22:42.527 --> 22:43.612
She wasn't moving.

22:45.739 --> 22:49.076
-She was...
-Late.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.663
I didn't know what to do,
so I called Frankie.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.464
I have nothing further.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.633
I have nothing, Judge.

23:05.842 --> 23:10.263
All right, this would probably
be a good time for a bowel movement.

23:11.306 --> 23:15.602
Uh, uh, lunch, I-I mean lunch!
Uh, uh, two o'clock.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.647
-Could we say 2:30 and make time for both?
-Silence!

23:19.147 --> 23:23.360
-I won't stand for your... your...
-Poop?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.916
Don't worry about me. I testify good.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.085
ALAN:
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.587
Frank, you need to check
all the personality at the door

23:42.671 --> 23:44.339
and just be honest up there.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.677
-Honest? The truth likely puts me in jail.
-And lying will guarantee it.

23:49.386 --> 23:53.056
If you never have another honest moment
in your entire life,

23:53.140 --> 23:54.766
you need to have one now.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.769
-Am I right, Denny?
-She's coming. I can feel it.

23:58.478 --> 24:02.023
My love goddess is about
to walk in right about now.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.776
-You all need to get to court.
-(chuckles)

24:05.986 --> 24:07.904
Denny, Frankie,
I'll meet you by the elevators.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.489
I need a second with Clarice.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.617
-(whispers) Is that a guy?
-It ain't Raquel Welch.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.456
I won't bore you
with a lecture on how life is hard.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.834
All I'll say is love's harder.
The odds are against us,

24:20.917 --> 24:22.878
and if you retreat inside Clarice
or anybody else

24:22.961 --> 24:26.256
every time it gets a little painful,
you haven't got a chance.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.049
If you really do love Claire,

24:28.133 --> 24:30.260
Clarence better catch
the next flight out of Bora Bora

24:30.343 --> 24:31.261
and get his ass back here.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.193
It's official. I popped.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.070
Wow, overnight?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.907
Well, over the last week.
I've been dressing around it.

24:51.990 --> 24:56.203
-Do we need to go to the hospital or--
-Yeah, in a couple of months.

24:57.454 --> 25:02.667
-Can I touch it?
-Yes, Brad. It's your baby. (chuckles)

25:09.883 --> 25:12.969
Sometimes,
you can actually feel him salute.

25:13.845 --> 25:18.266
Wow. We really need to start
focusing on schools.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.310
(clicks tongue) Yeah. Um...

25:23.396 --> 25:28.693
I heard you sort of exploded yourself
in front of the managing partners.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.988
Some pretty intense feelings, I'm told.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.243
-Well, it's a stupid policy.
-A lot of intense feelings about me.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.412
How intense exactly?

25:41.706 --> 25:43.041
Denise, you are such an idiot.

25:48.547 --> 25:53.677
Denise... I've been in love with you
for the past three years.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.764
-Oh.
-And I think you love me, too.

25:58.848 --> 26:03.186
You don't want to. You think I'm
this silly, right-wing conservative,

26:03.562 --> 26:06.356
and you're horrified that you actually
could love me, but I think you do.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.900
And you're what,
getting this from a psychic?

26:08.984 --> 26:10.485
-No, from you.
-Mm.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.237
Every time we make love.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.657
You see, when people just have sex,
their eyes dart around all over the place,

26:15.740 --> 26:17.993
like their hands,
sometimes they even close.

26:18.076 --> 26:22.497
But with you, your eyes are just
laser-locked, right onto mine.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.296
So, how much longer
are you going to deny this?

26:30.505 --> 26:33.633
Brad, we're dating.
Really, what more do you want?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.344
-I'd like to get married.
-What?

26:36.928 --> 26:39.347
-I want to get married.
-But we--

26:39.431 --> 26:40.599
You don't have to respond.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.685
I just want you to know
that the offer is on the table.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.606
That's a love contract I'll actually sign.

26:52.402 --> 26:57.699
It was maybe around seven o'clock.
My phone rang, and it was Neill.

26:58.074 --> 27:00.952
He sounded hysterical, I-I guess.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.538
I... I don't know.
I-I couldn't really hear him too good.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.417
Uh, I-I was on my cell phone,
I was in a motel room with a prostitute.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.169
-She was licking my toes at the time.
-Frank.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.005
-You said be honest.
-(chuckles)

27:12.088 --> 27:14.090
Uh, she was licking your toes?

27:14.174 --> 27:16.176
I got a few kinks, Judge.
I ain't proud of 'em.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.969
Do they charge extra for that?

27:18.053 --> 27:19.679
-Judge.
-What?

27:21.431 --> 27:23.391
ALAN:
After you got the call from your brother?

27:23.475 --> 27:28.063
I went over to his house,
and I went in his kitchen, and... I saw.

27:30.857 --> 27:34.027
Neill... (stutters) what happened?

27:34.110 --> 27:35.570
(stutters)
I told her I was gonna leave her,

27:35.654 --> 27:37.989
and then-then she started in on me.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.242
And I-I just swung it,
but I didn't mean to kill her.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.995
God, Frankie, what am I gonna do?

27:45.413 --> 27:48.375
Truth is,
I was becoming as undone as he was.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.294
You think you-you're prepared
for these things being a lawyer.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.589
You know what I'm saying?
But when it's your very own brother...

27:55.298 --> 27:58.885
Neill, Neill, look, now the police
are gonna figure this out, okay?

27:58.968 --> 28:01.012
It's gonna be pretty clear
that you killed her.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.055
I'm feeling nauseous.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.933
But as clear as it may be that you did it,

28:05.016 --> 28:08.103
proving it is gonna be
a whole different thing.

28:09.270 --> 28:14.317
I just kicked into survival mode,
Neill's survival.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.986
(clattering)

28:17.070 --> 28:19.489
Forensics, fingerprints, they don't
mean nothing, 'cause you live here.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.200
All the physical evidence
can be explained away with a lie.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.035
-(clattering)
-I need a big kitchen knife.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.663
-What?
-A kitchen knife.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.456
I need to get her prints
on a kitchen knife

28:28.540 --> 28:31.501
-so it looks like she lunged at you.
-Is that legal?

28:31.584 --> 28:33.753
You killed your wife.
Don't get hung up on the legal's!

28:33.837 --> 28:37.298
M-maybe I can say I came home
and found her like this.

28:38.925 --> 28:42.470
Listen to me.
They always look at the husband.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.932
You got no alibi.
She's screwing your boss.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.059
There has never been a bigger suspect.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.270
You've got to forget about
erasing suspicion.

28:50.937 --> 28:55.316
Our goal here is for you
to get away with murder.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.571
So that's what we did.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.031
We put the knife in her hand

29:02.115 --> 29:05.034
and made up the story
about her attacking Neill.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.328
Everybody knew she was abusive,
so we thought that would fly.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.371
What else?

29:08.455 --> 29:10.248
And we put her blood
on the edge of the counter,

29:10.331 --> 29:11.916
so it would look like
that's where she hit her head

29:12.000 --> 29:13.418
after Neill pushed her and...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.087
And then I got rid of the rolling pin.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.257
You concealed evidence,
obstructed justice,

29:19.340 --> 29:23.970
did everything you could to help
a person get away with murder?

29:24.637 --> 29:27.974
-Yes.
-ALAN: Mr. Cox, you're a lawyer,

29:28.057 --> 29:30.018
-an officer of the court.
-And that's my brother,

29:32.645 --> 29:37.275
a brother I spent a lifetime
probably embarrassing.

29:38.151 --> 29:42.614
Neill's a very moral person. I'm not.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.327
I've been arrested a bunch of times,
been busted with hookers.

29:51.122 --> 29:55.335
This is the first time I was ever
really in a position to help him.

29:56.586 --> 30:00.298
He, on the other hand,
always supported and helped me.

30:02.967 --> 30:03.843
I love him.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.679
And I would rather go to prison than...

30:09.224 --> 30:13.144
So, yes, I tried to help him
get away with a murder

30:13.228 --> 30:15.730
that I know, in his heart,
he did not mean to commit.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.873
The defendant admits
to concealing evidence.

30:34.374 --> 30:37.252
He admits to obstructing justice.
You listened to him yourself.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.170
Fact finding isn't in play.

30:39.879 --> 30:43.675
The only thing you have to do
is uphold the law.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.637
Now clearly,
defense doesn't want you to do that.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.265
In fact, if they stand here and say,

30:50.348 --> 30:52.976
"Hey, we admit
that he disregarded the law,"

30:53.852 --> 30:56.646
they are preying on your willingness
to do the same.

30:58.147 --> 31:01.985
When this trial began
you took an oath not to do that.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.197
An oath.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.662
I think oaths are overrated.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.582
An oath in this context

31:15.665 --> 31:20.336
is a sworn commitment to a set
of absolute fixed ideas

31:20.420 --> 31:22.422
within rigidly narrow parameters.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.091
The letter of the law
is often framed in absolutes.

31:25.174 --> 31:30.889
It's stated in black and white
but very often served in shades of gray.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.349
Stop playing the race card
in my courtroom!

31:33.433 --> 31:38.354
(chuckles) Let's not forget,
nobody got away with murder here.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.107
The brother is in prison.
He was convicted and put away.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.358
But that's not enough, I guess.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.821
The police want to go after Frank
and for what? He didn't hurt anybody.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.743
All he did was try and help a loved one
in desperate need.

31:52.368 --> 31:57.206
I bet we've all asked ourselves, uh,
the question at some point in our lives,

31:57.290 --> 32:01.502
"Would I help my brother or my father,
a friend,

32:01.586 --> 32:04.714
uh, try to get away with a crime,
a murder even?"

32:05.632 --> 32:06.841
Have you ever wondered?

32:08.885 --> 32:09.761
Have you?

32:10.511 --> 32:15.058
I doubt the answer comes quickly,
without a bit of a struggle.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.811
Frank Cox was faced with that question.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.439
He came down on the side
of brotherly love.

32:21.522 --> 32:24.192
Did that make him smart? Maybe not.

32:25.276 --> 32:32.075
But human... in our weakest moments
and perhaps our noblest, we're human.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.871
The law is meant to be human as well.

32:36.955 --> 32:42.794
That's why we temper all those written,
black-and-white absolutes with jurors,

32:43.378 --> 32:47.590
to humanize our judicial system,
to render the system fair,

32:48.383 --> 32:50.843
compassionate, imperfect.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.431
Frankie Cox loves his brother very much.

32:56.891 --> 33:01.312
That night when he discovered him
most desperately in need of his help,

33:02.730 --> 33:06.901
he gave it to him
as a loving brother would.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.680
(knocking on door)

33:39.809 --> 33:42.770
I'm sorry. I got, uh...

33:45.481 --> 33:49.527
I-I have certain fears
I'm trying to work on.

33:50.153 --> 33:50.987
And, uh...

33:52.530 --> 33:58.036
If I am going to be with a man,
he needs to work on his fears with me,

33:58.661 --> 33:59.495
not with call girls.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.582
Claire, I'm...

34:04.459 --> 34:09.047
I'm working hard to become a better man

34:10.548 --> 34:13.092
to the extent that you don't see
the work in progress.

34:13.176 --> 34:18.139
Clarence, even in the wig,
you are the best man I have ever known.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.307
(chuckles)

34:27.356 --> 34:31.694
The point of a relationship
is to see each other,

34:31.778 --> 34:35.865
know each other, the warts,
the work in progress;

34:35.948 --> 34:39.577
for you to be who you are,
what you are, all you are,

34:39.660 --> 34:41.913
trusting that none of it will be rejected.

34:41.996 --> 34:42.830
(chuckles)

34:44.999 --> 34:47.668
-Uh...
-What?

34:49.462 --> 34:50.296
I've...

34:51.881 --> 34:56.552
I've just never been able
to trust like that before.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.517
Please start.

35:04.143 --> 35:07.146
-Start with me.
-(chuckles)

35:17.490 --> 35:19.158
They've kind of been out forever,
haven't they?

35:19.242 --> 35:22.203
They've been deliberating
for less than an hour.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.414
Well, in my trials,
jury's back in half an hour, always.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.834
-(knocking on door)
-Of course, I always lose. Verdict?

35:27.917 --> 35:29.794
Uh, no, but someone's out here
looking for Mr. Crane.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.049
-A celebrity?
-(chuckles) Well, yeah. How did you know?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.718
-Icon, sexual predator?
-Actually, yeah.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.846
-Show her in, man.
-Okay.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.516
<i>-The Secret!</i>
-(chuckles)

35:45.643 --> 35:49.605
I heard you were here!
Remember me? Phyllis Diller!

35:50.148 --> 35:52.525
We had a moment during World War II.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.864
The man's an animal.
An animal, like a dog!

35:58.739 --> 36:01.576
(both laughing)

36:01.659 --> 36:04.162
I can see <i>The Secret</i>
has a few kinks to iron out.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.080
Sorry. Now we do have a verdict.

36:07.373 --> 36:14.130
-Oh.
-(cackling)

36:18.092 --> 36:20.052
The defendant will please rise.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.140
All right, what say you?

36:27.476 --> 36:32.148
Oh. Uh, uh, what say you?

36:32.815 --> 36:35.526
"In the matter
of <i>The Commonwealth vs. Frank Cox</i>

36:35.610 --> 36:38.529

36:38.613 --> 36:41.407
Members of the jury,
this concludes your service.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.035
-Judge.
-What?

36:44.118 --> 36:45.286
I believe there's more.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.207
Oh, dear. Is-is there, uh, more?

36:50.750 --> 36:54.337
We the jury find the defendant
Frank Cox...

36:55.713 --> 36:56.756
not guilty.

36:56.839 --> 36:57.715
(people murmuring)

36:57.798 --> 37:01.510
-What? Didn't I tell ya?
-You testify good.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.764
Members of the jury, this concludes
your service. It's concluded.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.391
-It's adjourned.
-(gavel bangs)

37:09.769 --> 37:11.604
Listen, Mr. Shore, seriously,

37:11.687 --> 37:14.398
(stammers)
I don't often speak from the heart,

37:14.482 --> 37:17.151
-since, you know--
-You've been unable to locate it.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.528
Good one. I gotta remember that.

37:20.321 --> 37:24.408
-Anyway, I'll never forget this.
-Neither will I, Frank.

37:25.117 --> 37:25.993
You don't have to...

37:26.077 --> 37:27.453
-(chuckles)
-...hug me.

37:35.711 --> 37:40.758
Brad, your passion carried the day.
The partners ruled in your favor.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.635
We're ditching the love contract policy.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.470
Oh, good.

37:44.553 --> 37:45.930
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.475
Shirley, would you have really fired me?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.521
Between you and me? Yes.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.986
Passion carried the day.
No more love contracts.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.905
-Oh, well, then you're two-for-two.
-What do you mean?

38:03.531 --> 38:05.866
The answer is yes.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.539
I am not going to give birth
to a litter of young republicans,

38:11.622 --> 38:13.582
but I don't suppose there's any harm
in having one

38:13.791 --> 38:15.042
who's in charge of homeland security,

38:15.835 --> 38:20.506
one who I'm horrified to admit I... love.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.384
-(elevator bell dings)
-ALAN: World War II?

38:23.467 --> 38:26.095
I was in a bunker.
She jumped me from behind.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.223
-Laws of attraction, I guess.
-I'm gonna sue those people.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.936
I believe I spoke last.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.523
-Are you gonna say anything at all?
-Oh, yes.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.695
Uh, only that I promise
you will never regret this.

38:42.778 --> 38:46.407
I will wake up every morning
and dedicate myself to making you happy.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.327
I believe you.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.831
-May I kiss the bride?
-You may.

I might. Who you got in mind?

39:20.983 --> 39:23.527
(chuckles) Nobody really.

39:26.864 --> 39:32.411
Oh, love can cause
such a variety of... insanities.

39:33.412 --> 39:37.249
It can impel a man to risk his freedom
for the sake of his brother.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.503
It can drive one to commit murder.

39:41.921 --> 39:46.258
And I suppose, of course, in the absolute
height of madness, it can--

39:48.844 --> 39:51.347

I worry about Clarence being in love,
the pain that goes along with it.

40:04.693 --> 40:09.824
-When were you last in love, really?
-(sighs)

40:11.367 --> 40:15.371
Ooh. Don't you long for it?

40:17.581 --> 40:22.169
I do, but I also fear it.

40:24.171 --> 40:30.803
The idea of part of me
being controlled by somebody else.

40:30.886 --> 40:35.933
Oh, that's the joy, the surrender.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.939
-Have you ever cried with a woman, Denny?
-Oh, many, many.

40:44.358 --> 40:48.529
-No. You?
-Never.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.825
-Some men do that, you know.
-Oh, I know. They're just weak men.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.162
-Not like us. We're, uh...
-BOTH: Strong.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.957

-Oh, damn it!

41:22.980 --> 41:25.941
And you wonder why I resist
these tender moments.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.319
-Just forget it.
-Oh, fine. Now I'm the bad guy.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.279
I said forget it. Can you do that?
