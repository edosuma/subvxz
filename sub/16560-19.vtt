WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.293
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.421
You will never get one-up on me, son.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.798
Dad, I fired you as my doctor years ago.
What are you talking about?

00:06.881 --> 00:07.882
And that was a mistake.

00:07.966 --> 00:08.967
Why'd you come to the game?

00:09.050 --> 00:12.429
To tell you, I'm not talking
about the end of my marriage with you.

00:12.512 --> 00:16.141
The next battle you fight will not be one
that you can handle alone.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.267
You know about my dialysis.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.935
I'm not gonna risk your
life to save my own.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.187
You need a kidney
or you're not gonna make it.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.815
For a guy who needs a kidney transplant,
you're going kind of hard.

00:24.065 --> 00:24.899
You taking my pulse?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.777
I run a seven-minute mile, I bench 325.
I think I'm gonna be all right.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.820
I just got to make sure.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.212
All right, listen up.

00:46.296 --> 00:50.300
Apparently, we have a vigilante
that keeps resurfacing in Little Havana.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.469
People are calling him Santo.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.972
Now, Santo, he isn't
some crackpot cherub of justice.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.557
This man is highly skilled.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.312
Recently, he's focused his attention
on the Calle Ocho cartel,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.482
which you guys are all aware
are notorious for robbing

01:05.565 --> 01:07.567
the local businesses in Little Havana.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.652
Two things you should know about Santo:

01:09.736 --> 01:12.072
he never kills, he never uses a gun.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.990
His weapon of choice...

01:14.491 --> 01:15.658
a baton.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.753
Okay, my two cents,
the longer Santo is out there,

01:26.836 --> 01:29.547
the more he will inspire
other nut jobs to copy him.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.091
Perhaps, but like it or not,

01:31.174 --> 01:32.842
this son of a bitch
is getting the job done.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.552
You see, I like to call it God's work.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.021
Now, lucky for us, one of my CIs

01:45.105 --> 01:47.607
just got the drop on a person
who fits Santo's description,

01:47.690 --> 01:49.275
last seen outside a building in the area.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.819
Got a couple of units
heading over there now.

01:50.902 --> 01:51.903
Ira...

01:52.278 --> 01:53.363
you care to run point?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.580
Police! Get down!

02:06.668 --> 02:07.669
I got two!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.381
They're still alive.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.424
Call an ambulance.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.592
You got it, Detective.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.303
Two inside! Two inside!

02:17.387 --> 02:19.973
...bound and unconscious
by the hands of local legend Santo.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.184
This is his fourth citizen's arrest
this past month.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.272
I'm Eagle Eye Ian Gutierrez,
your eye in the sky.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.441
Any chance Santo might be
able to save us tonight?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.360
There's always a chance.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.946
There is not a chance.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.114
We all know the deal.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.783
Rosie is having
kidney transplant surgery in two days.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.660
Lucky for y'all, Pippy's got a plan

02:40.743 --> 02:43.705
to make sure that his stay
in the hospital is on point.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.166
Okay, so we are doing...

02:46.958 --> 02:47.917
a makeover.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.003
Yeah, get excited.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.881
I want his hospital room
to feel like home.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.924
Okay, with that said,
Tee, you are in charge

02:55.008 --> 02:56.759
of buying those bougie
little pillows that he likes

02:56.843 --> 02:58.136
and some Pima cotton bedsheets.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.220
I'm on it. Got it.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.015
And, Mom, you are
in charge of Rosie's recovery.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.560
Okay, now, those books in the study,
they're a start, okay, but aromatherapy...

03:06.352 --> 03:07.353
That's really great.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.730
Vetiver oil, to be exact.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.481
Okay, Pipp, look, taking care of me

03:10.565 --> 03:11.983
pre-and post-surgery
has always been your thing,

03:12.066 --> 03:13.526
and you've been incredible at it.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.611
-You've really done a good job.
-Very good.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.695
-Right? She's done a great job.
-So good, yeah.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.489
But I'm thinking maybe
that it's time that...

03:20.074 --> 03:21.659
that I use my inside voice from now on.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.619
Please do that.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.954
Mitchie, I need you to
redress Rosie's room with stuff

03:25.038 --> 03:26.289
that's already here, okay?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.958
-Chairs, sofa, flat-screen.
-Sweet.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.168
Anything I can do for Slade?

03:30.251 --> 03:31.294
-Got that covered.
-And me?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.004
I just need you to do
what you always do, okay?

03:33.087 --> 03:36.341
Bring your surgery soundtrack,
Steely Blue on vinyl.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.135
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.511
Yes, ma'am, everything is...

03:40.595 --> 03:41.888
Good. Here we go.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.516
I've got hard-copy printouts
of your to-do list.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.601
Okay, there you go.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.603
So, guys, you can read them
right there in black and white.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.439
Please keep me in the loop
of any progress.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.732
Do not make me find you.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.192
All right, anybody hungry?

03:54.275 --> 03:55.526
I am starving.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.239
Pop! Hey!

03:59.656 --> 04:00.990
Hey! There's my guy!

04:01.783 --> 04:02.992
I'm a few days early. That okay?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.285
Of course. Of course.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.329
You're so early! Why didn't you tell us?

04:07.038 --> 04:08.122
Hi!

04:09.666 --> 04:11.376
-Pippy.
-It's a nice surprise.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.127
You know?

04:13.711 --> 04:14.712
Hey!

04:15.171 --> 04:16.339
-How you doing?
-Good.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.312
Yeah, nice shot.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.192
Hey, no, for real. This is Carlito's, huh?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.277
It is.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.363
Yeah, I am digging this new makeover, man.

04:40.446 --> 04:44.284
Flat-screens, a gentleman's pour of rum,
the sweet scent of picadillo.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.205
To Marcos and his work overseas,
the pride of Little Havana!

04:49.580 --> 04:50.581
Salud!

04:50.707 --> 04:52.250
-Salud!
-Salud!

05:05.471 --> 05:06.514
Yeah, the kid's still got it.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.598
Yeah, whatever.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.225
-Seal the deal with the--
-What did you say?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.686
Wow. She only gave you six numbers.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.770
Shut the...

05:13.438 --> 05:14.564
You're stupid, man.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.899
So, how's the job search going?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.068
Slow, but I'll get there.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.570
Why? You guys hiring?

05:20.653 --> 05:21.571
Who?

05:21.654 --> 05:22.822
EMPD.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.329
Probably. I mean, I don't know,
but I can ask.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.288
I mean, if you're...

05:30.371 --> 05:33.124
Wow. You really hit me
with the double "I mean."

05:33.207 --> 05:34.625
-That's not good.
-What?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.128
Of course it's good.
You're good, I'm good.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.963
The triple "good"? That's even worse.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.090
Relax. I'm just messing with you anyway.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.384
A body on 12th and Memorial?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.428
That's around the corner.
Mind if I go with you?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.639
-Be your plus-one?
-First of all, never say "plus-one."

05:48.723 --> 05:51.225
Secondly, the position's already occupied.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.104
Get a body bag.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.197
Go ahead.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.700
Oh, wow.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.203
Satellite dish in your
hospital room... fancy.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.497
Pippy tagged you into the mix, huh? Nice.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.790
Well, listen, feel free to say no.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.168
But trust me, when she sinks her teeth in,
she really sinks her teeth in.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.461
Her latch game is strong.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.879
I'll be there in the morning.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.381
Meet our John Doe.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.384
One of the locals spotted him
on their way to work.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.843
No ID, no nothing.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.931
Looks like the cause of death
is blunt-force trauma.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.058
Looking at the tram track
parallel contusions

06:32.141 --> 06:36.020
across the body, I'd say he was assaulted
with some type of steel rod or stick.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.814
No signs of a struggle.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.482
Or arterial spray, for that matter.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.983
He must have been dumped off.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.653
Look at that mark on his arm.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.948
Looks like a pitchfork
inside a faded circle.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.324
That's a trident spear.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.909
Wait a second, isn't that the same mark

06:49.992 --> 06:52.245
found on all of Santo's
"citizen's arrests"?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.497
Well Villa, those are real arrests, okay?
You don't need the air quotes.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.582
Well, it must have been
from the baton he uses.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.501
His wrists are bound
together by a green zip tie,

06:58.584 --> 07:00.253
another one of Santo's signatures.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.004
Yeah, but killing has never been his MO.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.881
That's because his MO keeps switching.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.550
In a month, Santo has gone

07:05.633 --> 07:08.428
from breaking up bar fights
to making arrests.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.013
I mean, in my opinion,
Santo looks good for this.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.098
Excuse me, Detective...

07:12.181 --> 07:14.642
Are you saying that Santo has just
committed his first murder?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.325
So, how's life in Pima cotton land?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.618
Glorious.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.703
That bad, huh?

07:34.328 --> 07:37.373
Well, Rosie's hand-woven sheets
are out of stock,

07:37.457 --> 07:40.710
and I've searched
everywhere from the Internet,

07:40.793 --> 07:43.296
the black market, and my last option is...

07:43.379 --> 07:45.339
wait for it... a sheet broker.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.757
A sheet broker?

07:46.841 --> 07:48.134
-Don't ask.
-Well, you know what?

07:48.217 --> 07:51.220
The cost of booking a mover last minute
is a third of my savings.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.305
Everything okay?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.639
-Couldn't be better.
-Fantastic.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.766
-I would say...
-One of the best days of the week.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.185
Listen, if the stuff
with Pippy is too much,

07:57.268 --> 07:58.519
you know you can tell me, right?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.146
Rosie, you've done so much for us.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.898
We're very happy to be doing this for you.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.358
Yeah, you didn't just give us a job,
you gave us a family.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.486
We got your back, man, no matter what.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.612
And you fear Pippy.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.946
That also.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.451
Hey. So, how's Slade feel
about our first TV close-up?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.161
-How do you think?
-Not great.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.954
Well, now that Santo knows we're onto him,

08:17.038 --> 08:18.956
we have to get in front of this
before he strikes again.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.084
I ran the victim's prints through CODIS,
but no identity popped up.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.754
We're checking other databases, as well.
Anything here?

08:24.837 --> 08:25.796
Well, the aluminum baton

08:25.880 --> 08:28.007
left a trace metal signature
on the arm and the leg.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.800
The brand is definitely a trident spear,

08:29.884 --> 08:31.636
but even at maximum resolution,

08:31.719 --> 08:33.763
we're struggling to make
out a really clear image.

08:33.846 --> 08:38.434
Also found burns and flesh wounds
along John Doe's back and his legs.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.937
And substantial swelling
in his liver and his spleen.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.522
He had some type of liver disease.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.106
You know, I can run
the peripheral blood smear

08:44.190 --> 08:45.775
under the microscope,
see what that gets us.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.068
Okay.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.236
Leaving so soon?

08:48.319 --> 08:51.197
Well, Feldheim canvassed Little Havana,
but nobody's talking.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.449
If anyone can get them to talk, it's me.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.034
Perks of being one of their own.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.328
-You want to come?
-Thought you'd never ask.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.045
Okay, well, if you hear or see anything,
here's my card.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.925
Wow. So, you grew up here?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.260
Look, I'm just warming up.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.928
Just warming up?
That's like the ninth person.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.846
-Ten's the charm.
-Ten's the charm...

09:15.930 --> 09:17.056
says no one.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.141
You could commit a crime
here and not get arrested.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.351
-Okay.
-No one could identify you.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.019
No one would pick you out of a lineup.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.481
Yeah, see, this place will
put you in the right space.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.401
Villa, tell me, what do you see
when you look at those anthuriums?

09:28.776 --> 09:29.777
Flowers.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.320
No, happiness, Villa. Okay?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.488
-Abundance.
-Leese!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.198
It's me, Izzy!

09:34.282 --> 09:35.658
Izzy Vermundo.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.785
Don't you remember me?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.829
Daisie and I used to work at Felipe's.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.038
You remember Felipe's.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.165
C-rating, three-day-old turrones.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.792
The place was a disaster!

09:44.875 --> 09:47.169
Right, right. Of course, of course.
Izzy, how are you?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.339
Good. You know, I hear you're a cop now.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.509
I've heard stories about you two,
mainly him.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
Good. So maybe you can help us out.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.180
We're looking for anything
you might have on Santo.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.851
Come on, Leese.
You know we don't talk to the cops here.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.270
But I can tell you this,
Santo is the reason

10:04.353 --> 10:06.355
I got my stolen money returned.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.525
And not just mine, all the other
businesses in the neighborhood.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.112
I never met the man,
but I am indebted to him.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.239
He is the lead suspect in a murder.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.907
Doesn't mean he did it.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.909
Hey! Marcos!

10:18.993 --> 10:20.202
Miss Vermundo!

10:21.329 --> 10:22.163
How are the twins?

10:22.913 --> 10:25.374
Wild, crazy, always hungry.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
I'd lock up their food, but
I think they'd eat the locks.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.420
-Right.
-Excuse me.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.213
What are you doing here?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.424
I'm meeting the waitress from last night.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.550
Can't show up empty-handed.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.178
Figure some roses for her,
some daisies for my Daisie.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.221
Cool points. Can never collect too many.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.765
So, what's up?
You guys working on the case?

10:40.848 --> 10:41.849
Yeah.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.310
What? He asked. I answered.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.187
I'm sorry.
Was this a violation of the sibling code?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.188
There's no sibling code.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.190
Well, there needs to be stat!

10:50.232 --> 10:51.776
Update from the lab. Excuse me.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.863
Extra set of eyes ain't gonna hurt, Leese.
Let me help you.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.448
There's nothing to help.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.325
-Okay? We have this under control.
-All right.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.495
Just got the X-rays back
from our John Doe's spine.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.538
Turns out there's damage
to the inferior surfaces

11:04.622 --> 11:06.457
is between the T5 and the L4.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.460
An injury that significant
is normally related to hikers.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.004
Or boot camp. I had that same injury.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.382
Maybe your John Doe was in the military.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.513
A friend of mine at the precinct said
Beaumont is working a case

11:20.930 --> 11:22.348
two days before his surgery?

11:22.431 --> 11:24.517
Well, we could tell him to slow down,

11:24.600 --> 11:27.395
but when he is determined to
get justice for a victim--

11:27.478 --> 11:29.063
Like a freight train with no brake.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.147
Ah-huh.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.441
No matter the personal cost.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.610
Our son grew up to be a remarkable man.

11:35.945 --> 11:36.946
Yes, he did.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.490
Remember that doctor who told us

11:39.573 --> 11:42.910
that he wouldn't make it
to his 15th birthday?

11:43.369 --> 11:46.414
And I remember two parents
who fought to prove him wrong.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.291
Two freight trains with no brake.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.836
Everything we are, we owe to that boy.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.633
-You okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.137
Because he's gonna be fine.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.349
You know, once I got close to the lab,
my ears started burning.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.270
Now that I see the two of you,
let's just say my ears are on fire.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.440
We were talking about you working a case
two days before your surgery.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.691
Hmm?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.776
So, when are you gonna solve this thing?
What's the latest?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.070
Well, our John Doe might
have been in the military.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.532
If so, his liver condition might be
connected to his service overseas.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.367
Well, it was.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.453
Tests revealed he had
visceral leishmaniasis.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.579
Also known as black fever.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.747
-Yeah.
-Huh?

12:27.830 --> 12:30.124
That's caused by
protozoan parasites, which is--

12:30.207 --> 12:31.876
Common in Syria and the Middle East, yeah.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.127
And if he was taking medication, then--

12:33.210 --> 12:34.545
VA could have a record.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.088
Could help us identify John Doe.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.590
The man, the myth, the legend.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.133
I see you, Pop. I see you.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.801
Aw. That's great.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.886
Hey, Pipp.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.389
You, uh, free to grab a bite?

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
Oh, I forgot. We need a record player
for Steely Blue.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.268
Can you get on that?

12:49.351 --> 12:51.562
The man, the myth, the legend,
whoever's available.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.150
First she ignores me
at Beaumont's, now this.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.528
Is there something I need to be aware of?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.946
You know, I could help you
figure this out,

13:01.030 --> 13:03.491
but where's the fun in that?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.493
Welcome home.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.793
-You wanted to see me, Cap?
-Oh, there he is.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.628
Yeah, what's the deal, Ira?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.087
These past few weeks,

13:17.171 --> 13:19.215
you've been the first one in,
last one out.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.509
Just trying to get ahead of the paperwork.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.345
Which brings me to my next point,
your reports have been tip-top.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.514
When are they not tip-top?

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
No, see, you don't understand.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.976
Recently, they have been,
tip-top.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.645
New year, new me.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.730
Just tightening up my game.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.815
Hmm? Okay.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.359
And here I thought it had
something to do with my...

13:38.442 --> 13:39.485
temp replacement.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.154
You know, post-surgery,
I'm on the mend four to six weeks.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.697
I'm aware of that.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.367
It's between you and Pearson
for my proverbial seat-warmer.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.493
Tortoise and the hare.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.786
You're the hare, I'm assuming?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.204
Actually, the tortoise.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.414
Bald head, world on my back.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.124
Yes. I see it.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.669
So, I looked into the local VA hospitals.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.589
Only one has treated a patient
for black fever in the past six months.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.300
Our John Doe's name is Dax Honeycutt.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.761
Ran his info, turns out,
he used to be in the Army.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.221
You think Santo is targeting vets?

14:07.304 --> 14:10.391
Well, I'm heading over to Dax's place
to get a better idea.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.978
So, Dax was in the Army.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.356
Well, that's a check
in the right column for Marcos.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.358
Yeah, one check. Una marca.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.609
I don't know, Villa.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.486
People in your neighborhood
really seem to spark to him.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.696
Yeah, people spark to me, too.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.447
Well, actually, in this scenario,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.575
you're a Sheriff Woody
and he's like Buzz Lightyear.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.368
Really? You just went Toy Story on me?

14:29.451 --> 14:30.703
Yeah, I went full Toy Story, yeah.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.205
See, Buzz and Woody, they didn't get along
throughout the whole movie,

14:33.289 --> 14:34.290
You know why?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.292
They were polar opposite.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.295
No, they actually were very similar,
kind of like you and Marcos,

14:39.378 --> 14:40.671
but here's the difference.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.965
Marcos has a whole lot
of room in his sandbox

14:43.048 --> 14:44.133
for other kids to play.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.467
Can you say the same?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.232
East Miami PD.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.613
Down on the ground now! Hands in the air!

15:05.696 --> 15:07.072
Get on the... Really?

15:08.782 --> 15:09.950
No! Wait!

15:10.034 --> 15:12.036
Eagle Eye Ian, the reporter.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.122
Aluminum baton, trident spear.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.541
You're Santo?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.008
You've got
the mild-mannered reporter thing down.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.635
Wouldn't have guessed that you're Santo.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.219
Because I'm not.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.348
But if I were,
you wouldn't be able to get me to talk.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.016
Really? Do tell.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.685
Your technique is... is weak.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.021
I can teach you a few things
after this is over.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.398
I mean, asking questions
is kind of my thing.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.109
Let's see if answering questions
is your thing, too.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.528
Why were you at Dax's apartment
with Santo's baton?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
The baton is for protection,

15:48.405 --> 15:50.908
and I was at the apartment
trying to find evidence

15:50.991 --> 15:52.201
to exonerate Santo.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.577
Huh?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.746
Looks like I picked up another skill.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.248
But do you have an alibi?

16:00.084 --> 16:03.879
Now, let's talk about how you
used this baton to kill Dax.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.547
You're gonna get a call from Pippy.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.132
Already did.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
She wants to make over my hospital room.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.011
I tried to decline,
but she blew right through me.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.347
She just wants you to be comfortable.
Embrace it.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.143
We got to get in there.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.065
The emblem on the baton does not
match the brand on Dax's body.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.067
The baton is fake.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.571
Which means I am not Santo.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.573
That doesn't mean you're not his lackey.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.201
Eagle Eye Ian is no one's lackey.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.996
You're a grown man who made a baton,
like another grown man.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.831
Calling you his lackey was me being nice.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.125
We mimic those who inspire us,
so the question is,

16:41.208 --> 16:43.377
what does Santo do to incite such faith?

16:43.460 --> 16:46.255
I knew revealing Santo's identity
would make a great story.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.508
When I was investigating him,
I ran into some thugs, and...

16:51.051 --> 16:52.302
their guns.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
Santo saved my life.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.225
I am a mild-mannered reporter.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.644
But I owe it to Santo to be more.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.147
I need to protect him
so he can give other people

17:03.230 --> 17:04.773
the second chance he gave me.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.316
What did you learn about Santo?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.610
That he's really good
at covering his tracks.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.738
I have no idea who he is.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.614
But how does Dax fit into this?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.659
Every time I was
investigating a lead on Santo,

17:15.743 --> 17:17.453
Dax wasn't far behind.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.705
Why would Dax follow Santo?

17:20.289 --> 17:21.415
I don't know.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.251
Look, Santo wears a disguise for a reason.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.671
But if Dax was close to
finding out Santo's identity,

17:27.755 --> 17:29.923
he may have killed him
to protect his secret.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.009
We need to find out
what Dax learned about Santo.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.222
Hey, look who I saw signing in
at the front desk,

17:37.306 --> 17:38.557
like a regular person.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.101
He is a regular person.
Marcos, what are you doing here?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.352
Come on, Villa. It's obvious.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.771
He's doing a pop-by.
I'm proud of you for that.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.231
Thank you. See, since I figured
I cracked the case wide open,

17:46.315 --> 17:47.316
I figured I'm part of the team now, right?

17:47.399 --> 17:48.859
Well, you know, really,
it's a tough process,

17:48.942 --> 17:50.527
but for you, we'll take it to a vote.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.071
All in favor, say "Aye."

17:52.154 --> 17:53.155
-Aye.
-Aye.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
Can you get an "Aye"? No?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.741
"Aye"? "Maybe"?

17:55.824 --> 17:58.786
Look, you did help us out,
but the crack you made was small, at best.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.913
Well, Dax was following
Santo for a reason,

18:00.996 --> 18:02.915
which means we got to
get inside Dax's head.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.042
And who better to help than another vet?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.295
Okay. What do you got?

18:08.378 --> 18:09.713
Vets thrive on routines,

18:09.797 --> 18:12.549
so if you want to find out
who or what's important in Dax's life,

18:12.633 --> 18:13.842
just look for any patterns.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.970
The tech guys got into Dax's bank records.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.182
I'll do a search for
repeating transactions.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.852
Every Thursday around 5:00 P.M.,
there's a $20 charge

18:23.936 --> 18:25.979
for Soldiers United in Coconut Grove.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.398
His first light-bulb moment.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.943
You know, I feel like
a proud big brother right now. No, I do.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.487
There's a support group
that meets around that time.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.197
And the money is for a rental fee,

18:35.280 --> 18:38.534
'cause in that group,
they don't sit around drinking coffee.

18:38.909 --> 18:39.993
You need ammo! Cover!

18:44.581 --> 18:45.833
Move!

18:49.711 --> 18:50.671
Follow me!

18:50.754 --> 18:51.839
Darn it!

18:52.464 --> 18:53.465
I'm out.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.510
The organization I work
with plans events for vets.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.721
I turned the field behind
my paint and body shop into a range.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.057
False sense of combat
gives a rush of adrenaline.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.601
Releases the endorphins,
gives the men a natural high.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.478
Bottom line, what we do...

19:07.563 --> 19:09.690
we get guys like you and me

19:09.773 --> 19:12.067
to do the one thing we hate most...

19:13.152 --> 19:14.153
talk.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.781
Head on a swivel,
measured steps, dilated pupils,

19:18.198 --> 19:19.658
combat withdrawal.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.702
You ever need to scratch that itch,

19:21.785 --> 19:23.453
you're welcome here any time, brother.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.539
Yeah, we're not here for me, man.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.668
So, did Dax ever mention Santo?

19:29.751 --> 19:31.712
Marcos, I ask the questions.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.131
What he said.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.050
No. He didn't really talk that much.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.427
Exception to the rule here.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.887
What about Dax's state of mind?

19:39.970 --> 19:42.181
Was he struggling with anything
since his time in the service?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.141
Look, I want to help
you, but if the guys learn

19:44.224 --> 19:46.018
that I'm spilling my guts to you,

19:46.101 --> 19:48.562
then they might start to feel
like this isn't a safe place.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.147
And I can't have that.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.523
But what about Dax?

19:51.607 --> 19:53.817
Or do you not care about your clients
once they're dead?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.861
You got a job to do. I get it.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.239
But what you won't do
is question my commitment to these men.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.700
-Let me tell you something--
-I was in the Army.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.535
I started in mine clearance.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.454
I showed other soldiers where to step

20:05.537 --> 20:07.539
so they could make it
to the other side safely.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.792
The things we did...

20:11.376 --> 20:14.213
make it nearly impossible
to come home whole.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.840
It's like walking into a mine field,

20:17.257 --> 20:19.092
one false step, and you're done.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.220
But if something Dax
went through over there

20:21.303 --> 20:23.722
led to a misstep over here,
then we need to know about it.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.226
His story could help guide
another brother safely to the other side.

20:30.103 --> 20:34.233
Dax was depressed, forgetful.
And he had a temper.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.318
I mean, he'd be messing
around with you one minute,

20:36.401 --> 20:38.737
and the next minute,
he would have you by the throat.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.033
Whatever demons he had over there,
they followed him home.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.286
I tried to help him. I did, but...

20:47.871 --> 20:48.872
I couldn't.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.584
Excuse me.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.299
I have an idea about Dax's demons.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.385
Is it normally this quiet?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.929
Hey, you wanted to be on the case.
This is being on the case.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.514
Bro, please tell me you found something.

21:05.764 --> 21:10.269
We found something and nothing,
a classic MCL twofer.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.354
If you only found one thing,
it's more like a one-er, right?

21:12.437 --> 21:15.816
The absence of something
is something. Ergo, twofer.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.276
-But--
-Marcos, just roll with it.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.527
He can do this all day. Trust me.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.738
Okay, Dax suffered from memory loss,
depression, and mood swings.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.950
Indications of brain disease,
like chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.744
Yes... CTE.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.248
Now, most people associate this
with head trauma from football injuries.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.542
Soldiers, though, are just as likely
to have a brain injury.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.503
If Dax had CTE,
that would bring up new avenues to follow.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.297
How'd he get hurt? Was it accidental?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.424
That might give us a clue to
what was going on in his head.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.967
We didn't find any evidence of CTE.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.427
We found algae.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.721
Yes, naegleria fowleri.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.850
We found traces in his nasal canal,
but it's probably from repeated exposure.

21:49.933 --> 21:53.687
And then we also found another
unknown substance in his nasal passage,

21:53.770 --> 21:55.022
so we're running tests to identify it,

21:55.105 --> 21:57.399
but we think it's unrelated
to the naegleria fowleri.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.026
Wait, I've heard of this algae.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.945
We had it in the water system
in our old high school in Little Havana.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.989
Soon after, they closed the school down.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.615
Well, Dax was following Santo.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.326
Maybe his search led him there.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.328
We need to check out that
high school right now.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.204
Santo could strike again at any moment.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.877
No sign of Dax outside.
Maybe we'll have better luck inside.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.213
Leese, this used to be our high school.
Man, look at it now.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
Yeah, well, with all the crime coming in,

22:21.965 --> 22:24.176
the school district
stopped pumping money in.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.553
Which is why we need guys
like Santo now more than ever.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.763
I'm sorry, what?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.265
Santo is a killer and a danger
to Little Havana.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.808
I don't think Santo murdered Dax.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.268
He was killed with Santo's baton.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.353
Or a replica.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.063
He's protecting us in ways
the police won't.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.147
We can't lose that.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.066
Who wants a one-way trip
to the happy place? On me.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.610
Why don't we get your opinion?
You've been abnormally quiet.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.404
And please don't say you fall
somewhere in the middle.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.698
I'm on Team Villa.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.117
-Which Villa?
-Which Villa?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.205
A door. A door that leads somewhere.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.748
Let's check it out.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.517
This is where Santo set up shop.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.645
Rosie, we need your team down here.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.690
Can you stop? You're messing up my thing.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.109
Why? This is better.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.860
Blue makes it better. Stop what?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.278
- Get out the blue.
- Why?

23:25.362 --> 23:26.405
What do you got?

23:27.280 --> 23:30.659
Well, we compared Dax's fingerprints
to the prints found in this room,

23:30.742 --> 23:32.953
and we got a hit, he was definitely here.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.205
All in all, there are ten sets of prints
in the boiler room.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.415
And we know who they belong to.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.542
Oh.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.836
-The prints belong to Dax.
-Didn't see that coming.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.462
Which means Dax was Santo.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.052
-Rosie, I want news.
-Oh, I got news.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.512
That's good, 'cause we got bupkis.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.805
Since Dax was Santo,

23:51.888 --> 23:53.807
we looked into everyone
who wanted Santo killed.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.351
All the low-level criminals
he turned in are still in jail.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.978
What about the Calle Ocho cartel?

23:58.061 --> 23:59.354
Dax targeted it for weeks.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.565
They were on surveillance
the night he was killed.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.567
They had an all-hands-on-deck meeting

24:03.650 --> 24:05.193
about how they were
gonna get rid of Santo.

24:05.277 --> 24:09.990
Yeah. So, in a strange turn of events,
cops provided an alibi for criminals.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.325
Yeah. We live in trying times.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.579
We matched the brand of the baton
to the marks on Dax's skin.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.248
But there was no blood
or DNA on the baton.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.793
Okay. Wow, so there's another baton
out there in the hands of our killer.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.211
Rosie, I asked for good news.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.547
No, you asked for news.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.966
Adjectives, Villa,
adjectives are our friends.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.927
If our killer isn't
from Dax's time as Santo,

24:31.011 --> 24:33.680
then maybe we need to look into
other parts of his life.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.474
There's nothing in his life
before or after

24:35.557 --> 24:37.392
his military career that sticks out.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.394
The Army just sent over Dax's file.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.730
You're looking at
ten years of military service.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.815
We're gonna need a little help
narrowing down a window.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.567
Well, maybe the body
will shed some light on that.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.902
I'll get back to the lab, check it out.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.111
I'll dig into the baton.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.197
If it's military issue,
that could help us.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.576
♪ I'm leaving on a jet plane ♪

24:55.494 --> 24:58.288
♪ And I covered up my tracks ♪

24:58.371 --> 25:01.124
♪ And I'm driven first place ♪

25:01.208 --> 25:02.209
♪Leaving first class ♪...

25:02.292 --> 25:04.503
-Just say it already.
-I told you Santo didn't kill Dax.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.129
Okay, well, now that that's over...

25:06.213 --> 25:08.298
No, I need to soak up that moment.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.633
I know how much you hate being wrong.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.009
Well, not always.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.971
I wish I was wrong about
how similar you and Dax are.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.349
I mean, look, whatever
he went through out there,

25:17.432 --> 25:19.518
he brought it back home, and now he's...

25:20.936 --> 25:22.354
He's dead, and...

25:22.771 --> 25:23.813
I don't want that for you.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.774
Yeah, look, I fought in a war.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.400
Came back shook up.
Don't make this a thing.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.860
It is a thing.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.696
You can't act like
your dishonorable discharge didn't happen.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.783
Not with you around. That's for damn sure.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.161
Look, hanging with you the last few days
has been great.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.289
I just wish it wasn't always
a long-winded interrogation with you.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.374
Damn!

25:42.457 --> 25:45.502
I wasn't interrogating you.
I was trying to be a good sister.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.586
You know what?

25:47.170 --> 25:50.257
Ever since you put on that badge,
you've been less sister, more cop.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.051
I just wish you could
turn off Detective Villa

25:53.134 --> 25:54.177
and just be Annalise.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.720
Everybody in the neighborhood
feels the same way.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.013
Oh, wow.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.683
You've been back for, like, two seconds,

25:59.766 --> 26:01.059
and you already have
your finger on the pulse.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.894
Oh, yeah? Remember Izzy
from the flower shop?

26:02.978 --> 26:03.979
Yeah.

26:04.771 --> 26:05.855
What about her?

26:06.189 --> 26:09.025
I knew about her kids
'cause I write letters to her

26:09.109 --> 26:10.443
and other people in the neighborhood.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.988
These people, this place, it's where
I feel the most comfortable, okay.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.865
So when I was over there dodging bullets,
I made time to stay connected.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.325
What about you? Hmm?

26:18.118 --> 26:20.579
Too busy playing cop.
That's why nobody trusts you.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.085
Does that include you?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.677
Yeah, I got to go.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.684
Your surgery is tomorrow.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.769
Tell me this case is winding down, not up.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.731
Well, let's just say
it's winding sideways.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.815
Look...

26:49.274 --> 26:51.860
I know you hate leaving
something unfinished, so...

26:51.943 --> 26:54.279
if it'll make you feel better,
I'd be happy to pitch in.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.157
I think Mitchie's got it covered.
But thanks.

26:58.825 --> 26:59.826
Okay.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.540
Oh. You have everything you need
for the surgery?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.042
Yeah, for the most part.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.210
Well, that doesn't sound good.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.795
What's missing?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.093
Steely Blue.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.637
And let's just say it's a long story

27:18.720 --> 27:21.306
that ends with me not having
it in my possession anymore.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.558
But you let Pippy think you had it.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.143
Yeah.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.354
Ooh. You in trouble.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.980
Only if she finds out.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.358
Well, your secret's safe with me.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.360
She's still giving me the cold shoulder.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.570
-I'm gonna get going.
-All right.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.541
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-Hmm.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.001
I'm not talking about Dad.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.628
Okay, you listen, I'll talk.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.630
"Sibling silence is golden."

27:53.713 --> 27:54.839
You're sibling coding me?

27:55.507 --> 27:57.300
Number 42... Respect the code.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.470
Okay, well, right back at you.
"Sibling silence is golden unless..."

28:01.429 --> 28:02.430
I forgot subsection A.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.308
"Unless it hurts a member of the family."

28:05.850 --> 28:08.520
Now, you and Dad not talking
is no bueno to me, so spill it.

28:09.562 --> 28:13.233
All right, well, since the divorce,
Dad hasn't been himself.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.444
Look, between my breakup with TMI
and you going off the rails,

28:16.528 --> 28:17.904
he hasn't lifted his finger
one time to help.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.115
He offered, but we... that includes you...

28:20.198 --> 28:21.408
said that everything was okay.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.952
Our father doesn't need
to ask to get involved.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.413
You know, he likes to just
get all up in your business,

28:26.496 --> 28:29.499
and now he's acting like he's a guest
in his own family.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.460
Yeah.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.380
I...

28:37.006 --> 28:38.216
I forgot my coat.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.054
Well, maybe Dad is off his game

28:43.138 --> 28:46.641
because he feels like
we didn't need him on the roster.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.435
All right, Rosie, this is cuckoo bananas.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.145
Is it?

29:03.533 --> 29:04.534
I'm sorry.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.164
The divorce, living away from family...

29:10.123 --> 29:13.918
I guess I'm just trying to find my way
in this new normal.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.504
Well, let me help you out.

29:17.630 --> 29:18.798
We always need you.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.678
Especially when it looks like
we've got it all worked out.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.433
Dax was in the Army for a decade.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.851
That's dozens of missions.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.060
I think I've found something

29:31.144 --> 29:33.646
that pinpoints which mission
we should be focused on.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.024
Now, when I cue you, tap the button.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.776
And why can't you do it?

29:37.859 --> 29:40.361
Because I can't say
"Black-light my world!"

29:40.445 --> 29:42.030
if I'm the one
black-lighting my world, okay?

29:42.113 --> 29:44.324
So... black-light my world.

29:46.826 --> 29:51.039
Sometimes healed scars are
invisible in normal light.

29:51.831 --> 29:52.665
What caused them?

29:52.749 --> 29:54.709
My theory, electric cables.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.628
On the soles of his feet?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.421
Rosie, are you saying Dax was tortured?

29:58.505 --> 30:01.591
Well, it's a technique called falaka,
a trademark of the Syrian intelligence.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.219
Now, Mitchie did some digging.
Tap the button in the square.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.970
Do I look like Vanna White to you?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.430
Will you just hit the button?

30:09.974 --> 30:13.061
Three years ago, Army paratroopers
from the 85th Airborne Unit

30:13.144 --> 30:14.687
were captured by Syrian intelligence.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.772
Yes, it made the news.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.025
It says here, after a few months,
they were rescued.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.778
This is an emblem of
the 85th Airborne Unit.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.655
Tap the square at the end.

30:24.697 --> 30:25.698
Last time.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.123
The emblem is the perfect match
to the mark left by Dax's baton.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.459
Exactly. I think Dax was part
of the 85th Airborne Unit.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.879
If the baton is standard issue,
it makes sense that there's more than one.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.757
Which means Dax was killed
by someone he served with.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.683
We started digging into the 85th Airborne.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.017
They had ten members.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.061
One of them sticks out... Carly Velasco.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.814
She had both batons made,
but they're not military issue.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.816
She put in a request to
use them during combat.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.109
Were she and Dax involved?

31:01.192 --> 31:03.611
Not sure, but she was from Little Havana,

31:03.695 --> 31:06.823
and she was tortured with Dax
and others from the 85th Airborne.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.950
"Was"? So she's resting
in peace somewhere?

31:09.033 --> 31:10.368
Arlington Cemetery.

31:10.451 --> 31:12.370
She died as a result of the torturing.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.081
We're looking into the other members
of the 85th Airborne.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.165
Keep me posted.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.752
Ira, can I talk with you for a minute?

31:20.712 --> 31:21.754
What's up, Cap?

31:21.838 --> 31:23.506
Well, I wanted you to hear it first.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.134
You're not the guy.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.720
I'm picking Pearson
as the temporary captain.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.638
Okay. Well, thanks for letting me know.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.807
Hey, that's it?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.184
You have something else to say?

31:35.268 --> 31:37.228
Well, yeah, I do have
something else to say.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.897
I thought this would be a lot more fun.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.065
I'm kidding with you.
Of course you're the guy.

31:41.983 --> 31:42.984
What's wrong with you?

31:44.444 --> 31:45.445
Thank you.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.031
But I decline.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.490
You decline? Are you serious?

31:49.574 --> 31:51.534
Yeah, I'm serious. You're having surgery.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.369
You're gonna need things,
help and whatnot,

31:53.453 --> 31:56.539
and I want my schedule open
in case I'm the guy you want to call.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.459
So that's why you've been
burning the candle at both ends.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.169
What you're doing for Rosie...

32:02.128 --> 32:03.129
that's tip-top.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.423
That makes you family.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.092
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for family.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.852
Pipp, can I have my phone back, please?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.104
Why? So you can bug Villa
for an update on the case?

32:20.188 --> 32:21.522
I don't think so.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.691
Hurricane Pippy's in full effect.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.569
Hurricane who? What was that?
Is that what you guys call me?

32:26.653 --> 32:28.112
Pretty much all of us, yeah.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.115
Whatever. You can't deny that
Hurricane Pippy gets it done.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.200
That is true.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.953
I mean, you've turned this room
into a five-star suite.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.121
How long has Hurricane Pippy been a thing?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.999
I think since, what, nine?

32:40.083 --> 32:43.795
Mom and Dad, they wanted to make me feel
like I was a part of what was going on...

32:43.878 --> 32:45.505
So we made her Beaumont's caretaker.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.216
Yeah, man, that taught me,
like, responsibility,

32:48.299 --> 32:49.759
gave me confidence.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.136
All right, only one tradition left.

32:52.595 --> 32:53.888
Rosie, where's Steely Blue?

32:55.974 --> 32:56.975
I don't have it.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.769
Rosie. Did you lose it? Did you break it?

32:59.852 --> 33:01.729
And why was Pippy not informed, guys?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.231
'Cause I didn't want
to have to admit to you

33:03.314 --> 33:05.400
or to myself what actually happened to it.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.694
Tawnya happened to Steely Blue.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.654
Son, you don't need it.

33:09.737 --> 33:12.198
You can just push on forward without it.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.282
There's no need for that.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.494
I found another copy of the album.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.539
Pop, Steely Blue is seven kinds of rare.
Where'd you get it?

33:19.622 --> 33:23.751
The Internet. There's a site that pieces
together albums from various sources.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.795
It's great. I'd never heard of it.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.130
-Mitchie?
-Yeah, Mr. Rosewood,

33:27.213 --> 33:28.840
I'm gonna need to scrub
your computer later

33:28.923 --> 33:29.966
so you don't get arrested.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.385
Well, anyway, Mom, you know what?
I think you're right.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.762
It's time for me to press forward
without Steely Blue.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.765
I think I know someone
who needs it more than I do.

33:47.984 --> 33:50.028
I'm loving the tricked-out hospital room.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.946
Yeah, well, Pippy Rosewood
worked her magic.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.781
I mean, half this stuff isn't even mine.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.991
I got you a gift.

33:55.324 --> 33:56.492
You didn't have to do that.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.749
"I gave Rosie a kidney,
and all I got was this lousy coffee mug."

34:04.208 --> 34:05.877
Nice. Thank you.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.962
So, where are we with the case?

34:08.046 --> 34:10.715
We checked into the other members
of the 85th Airborne,

34:10.798 --> 34:12.759
and they all have alibis, but get this...

34:12.842 --> 34:17.180
Dax was Carly's commanding officer
on the mission when they were captured.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.682
In fact, he requested her.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.393
So you think somebody in Carly's life
blamed Dax for her murder?

34:22.477 --> 34:23.478
Feldheim's digging.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.522
And I'll join him once
you're done with surgery.

34:26.606 --> 34:27.440
Okay?

34:27.523 --> 34:29.567
Ah. Update on the case.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.693
I was going through withdrawals.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.153
Aren't you supposed to be resting?

34:32.236 --> 34:33.279
I want to talk to Slade.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.406
I'll give you two a moment.

34:41.496 --> 34:45.792
You know, when I had my first surgery,
I met this other patient.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.712
He was a musician, Kenny Fitzpatrick.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.506
He was having heart surgery, just like me.

34:51.589 --> 34:55.009
But Kenny lost his family,
his possessions,

34:55.093 --> 34:56.260
and he was losing his health.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.970
And despite all of that,

34:58.054 --> 35:00.848
Kenny still managed to see
the world through this prism

35:01.766 --> 35:03.810
that allowed him to see
the very best in everyone.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.269
Sounds like somebody I know.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.146
Yeah, well, he was my rock.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.690
When it came time for my surgery,
I was so scared.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.693
So he gave me a copy of his album...
Steely Blue... to play in the O.R.

35:12.777 --> 35:16.823
So he wanted you to feel
like he was there with you.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.199
Yeah.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.784
What happened to him?

35:20.701 --> 35:22.495
He died during surgery.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.789
And ever since then,
I've made it my mission

35:24.872 --> 35:27.583
to emulate the light
that he gave to the world.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.546
And Steely Blue plays during
every single surgery I've had.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.507
Anyway...

35:36.509 --> 35:37.510
I want you to have it.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.347
I hope it helps you the way it helped me.

35:43.724 --> 35:44.725
Thank you.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.653
Pop, how are you in here?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.405
People in high places.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.074
Do I need to remind you that you got this?

36:00.658 --> 36:01.659
Maybe just a little.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.327
You got this.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.913
You're the strongest person I know.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.374
And there's still a lot
in this life for you to do.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.626
Do we understand each other?

36:18.050 --> 36:21.345
You know, I never...
thought about what an OR sounds like.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.264
I don't like it.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.391
Regretting giving up Steely Blue?

36:25.474 --> 36:30.104
No, I mean, you're here,
thinking about Steely Blue...

36:37.069 --> 36:38.738
That's therapeutic enough for me.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.573
What's going on?

36:40.656 --> 36:42.241
I just gave myself a light-bulb moment.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.327
I need you to deliver a message.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.416
Check the substance in Dax's nasal passage
for calcium carbonate.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.500
Okay. Why?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.669
Beaumont thinks
it'll prove who killed Dax.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.759
On your left! Nine o'clock.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.139
Figured you'd be back.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.101
Couldn't say anything earlier,
not in front of my sister...

37:09.185 --> 37:11.687
but I was hoping to get
some one-on-one time.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.272
Absolutely.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.358
This whole place is your canvas, man.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.777
I'm not sure if you knew
or if anybody knew,

37:17.860 --> 37:20.029
but... Dax was Santo.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.031
Got a lot of love for vigilantes.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.742
They're the voice for the little people,
you know?

37:25.117 --> 37:27.078
Tasked to repair a broken community.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.581
But sometimes they cross the line.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.459
See, I know all too well, man.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.836
I was dishonorably discharged.

37:36.420 --> 37:40.091
I took matters into my own hands,
and somebody got hurt.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.175
But you...

37:41.926 --> 37:43.427
You took it a step further.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.054
We know you killed Dax, Asa.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.765
Yeah. You did it here
and dumped his body in Little Havana.

37:47.848 --> 37:48.975
You got to be kidding me.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.560
We found calcium carbonate
in his nasal cavity...

37:51.644 --> 37:53.938
an ingredient
that's normally found in paint.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.482
And the paint was a special blend
found in two places...

37:56.565 --> 37:58.693
your paint shop and the aluminum baton.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.320
Dax inhaled it
during a therapeutic game of paintball.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.656
And the baton,
well, you made that for Carly.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.157
You're a welder by trade.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.994
We also found an engagement
ring in Carly's effects.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.037
You two were planning on getting hitched.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.747
But you kept that a secret.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.711
Me, Dax, and Carly, we met in boot camp.

38:16.794 --> 38:20.214
She was the only girl,
but she could hold her own.

38:20.298 --> 38:25.845
The three of us did a few tours overseas,
but we made a pact

38:26.762 --> 38:29.682
that we would retire after the third one.

38:29.765 --> 38:33.769
But Dax convinced Carly to join
the 85th Airborne, do one more tour.

38:33.853 --> 38:38.065
He promised me
that he would bring her back to me.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.445
When Carly died, you gave one baton to Dax
and used the other one to kill him.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.155
You blamed Dax for her death,

38:44.238 --> 38:46.324
even though you knew it was accidental.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.701
The vigilante thing was Carly's idea.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.163
She was raised in Little Havana,
and recently,

38:52.496 --> 38:55.833
her whole neighborhood took a rough turn.

38:55.916 --> 38:56.917
She...

38:57.835 --> 38:58.878
She wanted to fix it.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.714
But couldn't.
That's where Dax stepped in.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.550
His way of finishing the job
Carly never got a chance to start.

39:04.633 --> 39:07.595
Asa Stratton, you're under arrest
for the murder of Dax Honeycutt.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.679
Get up.

39:35.039 --> 39:40.711
♪ Do I take only what I'm given? ♪

39:41.295 --> 39:46.342
♪Do I harbor only regret? ♪

39:48.344 --> 39:49.970
♪ Like a stone in the water ♪...

39:51.680 --> 39:54.517
♪ A stone in the water ♪

39:55.059 --> 39:56.477
♪Riding on ♪

39:56.560 --> 39:57.561
Gerald.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.982
You didn't have to come
all the way down here.

40:03.025 --> 40:05.152
I told you... I'm okay.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.487
I know.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.364
But a little birdie told me to ignore you.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.865
Which birdie?

40:10.366 --> 40:13.911
I just passed along Gerald's number, so...

40:13.994 --> 40:15.371
You're everybody's rock.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.332
But sometimes,

40:18.791 --> 40:20.334
you need a rock, too.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.586
It's a pleasure. Pleasure to meet you.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.921
Pleasure's all mine.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.427
So, for those keeping score,

40:29.510 --> 40:33.305
you have brought Rosie his album
and Gerald to Mom.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.933
So what you got for Pippy?

40:43.774 --> 40:44.775
I'll take that.

40:49.155 --> 40:54.577
♪ They will chase me down the river ♪

40:55.453 --> 41:00.916
♪ They will never hear me cry ♪

41:02.543 --> 41:05.379
♪ Like a song from a mother ♪

41:06.130 --> 41:08.716
♪ A song from a mother ♪

41:09.175 --> 41:13.471
♪ Singing on, singing on ♪

41:13.554 --> 41:17.349
♪ Till the angel comes ♪

41:19.727 --> 41:20.728
Hey.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.480
I owe you an apology, Leese.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.064
No, you don't.

41:24.899 --> 41:25.983
You were right.

41:26.066 --> 41:29.737
I mean, it's okay to put the badge away
from time to time

41:30.154 --> 41:32.156
and reconnect with the old neighborhood.

41:32.823 --> 41:33.824
It's just...

41:35.075 --> 41:36.243
The museums,

41:37.244 --> 41:40.831
the old guys in the park playing dominoes,

41:42.333 --> 41:45.044
the scent of hand-rolled cigars...

41:45.127 --> 41:46.629
It reminds you of Dad.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.672
Everything I love about that place

41:50.132 --> 41:52.092
is what I miss about him.

41:52.718 --> 41:53.844
Yeah.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.554
Guess who I ran into the other day.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.140
Ramon Campos.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.685
The kid who used to bully you
in the fourth grade?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.229
Every day that year.

42:03.312 --> 42:06.607
Till you caught wind of it
and you put him in the...

42:06.690 --> 42:08.776
in the camel clutch, like The Iron Sheik.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.402
I loved that wrestling move.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.366
From that day on,
the legend of Leese grew.

42:15.866 --> 42:19.161
Being with you today
took me back to that time.

42:20.329 --> 42:23.624
I realized that, in small ways,

42:23.707 --> 42:28.128
my sister Annalise always
had a little Detective Villa in her.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.673
And that's cool with me.

42:32.424 --> 42:35.219
Hey, thanks for letting me be
a part of the take down today.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.137
Of course.

42:37.513 --> 42:41.600
And just FYI, that stuff I said to Asa...

42:43.310 --> 42:44.311
it was true.

42:45.020 --> 42:50.776
♪ I will turn to face the shadows ♪

42:52.903 --> 42:54.363
There's been a complication.

42:54.613 --> 42:55.447
Miss D.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.450
Is everything okay?

43:02.788 --> 43:04.081
Charging.

43:04.456 --> 43:05.457
Clear!

43:07.084 --> 43:08.085
