- DAVE: Oh, my God.
- Is this garlic hummus?

00:01.454 --> 00:03.091
- DAVE: I like it.
- Should we, like, switch

00:03.091 --> 00:04.427
to tahini, or... ketchup?

00:04.427 --> 00:06.064
I think we should, like, uh,

00:06.064 --> 00:08.001
abandon all condiment-based
hand jobs just for a moment.

00:08.001 --> 00:09.504
- You could be right.
I don't know.
- We can reconfigure,

00:09.504 --> 00:10.874
come up with something new
fun to do.

00:10.874 --> 00:12.209
What do you want to do next?

00:12.209 --> 00:13.880
Uh, wash my hand?

00:13.880 --> 00:15.516
Right this way.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.453
- Yeah.
- You think
you know my home, right?

00:17.453 --> 00:19.057
- I think I do.
- You think you know me.

00:19.057 --> 00:20.694
You think you know
what I stand for?

00:20.694 --> 00:22.096
- Where you going?
- Turns out
you don't know anything

00:22.096 --> 00:23.666
about my home.

00:23.666 --> 00:24.868
Shut up!

00:24.868 --> 00:27.373
Turns out...
I'm a little bit of a mystery.

00:27.373 --> 00:29.344
As is this secret passageway.

00:29.344 --> 00:31.749
This is so much cooler
than a hummus hand job.

00:31.749 --> 00:33.820
- DAVE: Yeah, we should
probably wash up.

00:53.726 --> 00:55.864
Is she gonna actually

- Who's she?
- Oh. Emma.

She just left this here.

01:02.009 --> 01:03.546
You're basic for saying

01:03.546 --> 01:05.049

- You're better than that?

01:05.049 --> 01:06.284
No, you're just a contrarian,
you know?

01:06.284 --> 01:07.486
Come here.
I'm gonna shut you up.

01:07.486 --> 01:10.192
Oh, what the fuck is this?

01:11.729 --> 01:12.864
What?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.802
That's my bear mace.

01:14.802 --> 01:17.206
- Your bear mace?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.206 --> 01:18.508
(laughs):
To be fair,

01:18.508 --> 01:20.714
that was supposed to go
next to the bed.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.450
Yeah, look, we'll put it
in the closet,

01:22.450 --> 01:24.354
'cause things like this
don't belong out in the...

01:24.354 --> 01:26.191
- This is not how we do it
in Los Angeles, okay?
- Good call, Captain.

01:26.191 --> 01:27.794
Yeah. And I'm not above
what I preach, you know?

01:27.794 --> 01:29.364
We can't have crossbows
in the closet, either.

01:29.364 --> 01:32.169
This was from tour.
This will be moved.

01:32.169 --> 01:33.606
- Oh, look at this.
- (closet door closes)

01:33.606 --> 01:35.009
- Is that my elephant?
- Yes, he made a friend.

01:35.009 --> 01:36.846
- Oh, wow.
- Look.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.950
DAVE:
Oh, which one is he? He's--
Oh, he's the sturdy one.

ROBYN:
You know that you don't
actually own him, right?

01:40.987 --> 01:43.559
You just--
you finance his survival.

01:43.559 --> 01:45.396
And one day, me and you
are gonna go to Africa,

01:45.396 --> 01:46.966
and we're gonna visit our boy.

01:46.966 --> 01:48.536
- Stop.
- Yeah, it's our son,

01:48.536 --> 01:51.408
and we deserve to see him,
and he deserves to see us.

01:51.408 --> 01:53.512
You're such a good
hands-on father.

01:53.512 --> 01:55.950

02:09.477 --> 02:11.514
He wants me to get fitted
for the Met Gala.

02:11.514 --> 02:14.087
- Uh, I got invited, and I--
- Wait, what?

02:14.087 --> 02:15.422
- Yeah.
- Wait, what?

02:15.422 --> 02:17.393

Yeah. Yeah.

02:20.499 --> 02:22.103
Why are you so high-pitched?

02:22.103 --> 02:24.541
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's crazy.
Wait, that's huge.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.444
I-I don't get wrapped up
in this superficial

02:26.444 --> 02:28.616
Hollywood pecking order bullshit anymore.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.785
That's old me.

02:29.785 --> 02:32.022
New me, way more into...

you walking up those steps

- Yeah?

02:37.601 --> 02:39.170

- Mm.

02:39.170 --> 02:41.274

You can bring attention to

- A cause.

05:05.062 --> 05:06.632

05:20.994 --> 05:22.664

- Hmm.

05:22.664 --> 05:24.735
We have 11 years
to stop the temperature

05:24.735 --> 05:27.072
from rising
1.5 degrees Celsius,

05:27.072 --> 05:28.709
and if we don't do that,

05:28.709 --> 05:30.112
it will lead to
catastrophic damage

05:30.112 --> 05:31.749

I use my platform for good?

I'm living in the world

or two and a half degrees
Celsius not reach

17:08.409 --> 17:11.281
My name's Jack.

17:12.684 --> 17:14.053
What's your name?

17:14.053 --> 17:15.390
Like, my legal government name?

17:15.390 --> 17:17.661
'Cause I know you know
my artist name.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.101
The whole reason
that you're even here

17:21.101 --> 17:23.305
- is because I came first.
- Mm.

17:23.305 --> 17:26.144
Look at how you've modeled
your whole physicality.

17:26.144 --> 17:28.983
I mean,
surely you must hear it a lot.

17:30.052 --> 17:32.123
I do know who you are,
and you're actually...

17:32.123 --> 17:34.628
the worst thing that's
ever happened to my career.

17:34.628 --> 17:36.197
Hard to compete.

17:36.197 --> 17:38.335
You know, just being associated
with you at all is...

17:38.335 --> 17:40.840
it's tough. I can't lie, but...

17:40.840 --> 17:42.544
I get through it,
as you can see.

17:42.544 --> 17:44.815
It's hard to be associated
with this level...

17:44.815 --> 17:46.485
of art.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.288
It's a breeze
at the end of the day.

17:48.288 --> 17:50.125
- (both laugh)
- Don't touch.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.129
You can look,
but you can't touch.

17:52.129 --> 17:53.566
I'd rather touch almost.

17:53.566 --> 17:55.370
I'll give it to you,
you got hot.

17:55.370 --> 17:56.906
Some people want to be hot,
some people don't, I get it.

17:56.906 --> 17:58.409
"Ooh, I put earrings in."

17:58.409 --> 17:59.978
If I wore those,
I'd look like a woman.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.448
- (sniffing)
- What are you doing?

18:01.448 --> 18:02.918
Mmm.

18:02.918 --> 18:05.088
You stink, bitch.

18:05.924 --> 18:08.396
I like that.

18:09.832 --> 18:12.002

Got beef?

18:12.002 --> 18:14.541

18:15.810 --> 18:18.114
Pussy.

18:18.883 --> 18:21.321
Okay.

18:21.321 --> 18:23.191
"Slab"?

18:27.064 --> 18:30.573
Thank you all so much
for joining us here today.

18:30.573 --> 18:33.044
So, Demi, tell us,
where do you stand

18:33.044 --> 18:34.815
on the media's portrayal
of mental health?

18:34.815 --> 18:38.054
Well, look, I've made
my fair share of mistakes.

18:38.054 --> 18:40.125
And I love you, media,

18:40.125 --> 18:42.296
but you love to tear us down.

18:42.296 --> 18:44.601
Still if you've got a platform,

18:44.601 --> 18:46.372
you have to stay open,

18:46.372 --> 18:47.974
keep yourself accountable,
you know what I mean?

18:47.974 --> 18:50.112
I agree, you got
to put your shit out there

18:50.112 --> 18:51.815
- every day.
- Wait, we can curse?

18:51.815 --> 18:53.051
I want a do-over.

18:53.051 --> 18:54.388
(laughter)

18:54.388 --> 18:56.157
Oh, yeah, you a fool,
Demi Lovato.

18:56.157 --> 18:58.563
And you got a cold-ass falsetto, but...

18:58.563 --> 19:00.667
that's what it's about though,
you know? Share your pain,

19:00.667 --> 19:03.004
and somebody else
will share theirs, too.

19:03.004 --> 19:04.708
Lot of people connect
with me, honestly,

19:04.708 --> 19:06.110
'cause I am bipolar.

19:06.110 --> 19:07.514
(audience murmuring)

19:07.514 --> 19:08.683
Oh, me, too.

19:08.683 --> 19:10.185
I feel you on that.

19:10.185 --> 19:12.056
I think it's about staying
true to your feelings.

19:12.056 --> 19:13.726
For me, at least. You know,

19:13.726 --> 19:15.663
when I was younger,
things were a little confusing.

19:15.663 --> 19:18.536
I had to understand
my gender identity,

19:18.536 --> 19:20.038
my sexuality...

19:20.038 --> 19:21.742
Sexuality? Oof!

19:21.742 --> 19:23.144
That shit got me going crazy.

19:23.144 --> 19:24.681
Did y'all know
that I'm a sex addict, too?

19:24.681 --> 19:26.050
Check this story out.

19:26.050 --> 19:27.687
One time, I was in my car,
bored as hell,

19:27.687 --> 19:29.290
so I, you know,
slide in a chick's DM,

19:29.290 --> 19:30.526
tell her to come through,
she pull up,

19:30.526 --> 19:32.497
whoop-deep-whoop,
yada, yada, yada.

19:32.497 --> 19:34.367
But she didn't look nothing
like her pictures though.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.937
That's when I realized

19:35.937 --> 19:39.043
I got sucked by a fat bitch
just to feel something.

19:39.043 --> 19:41.849
And after I bust,
I'm like, "Damn.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.753
Nigga really got a problem."

19:43.753 --> 19:45.456
(audience whispering, murmuring)

19:45.456 --> 19:47.259
What the fuck is
Gata talking about

19:47.259 --> 19:48.996
in front
of all these white people?

19:48.996 --> 19:50.867
Hey, do you, do you know him?

19:50.867 --> 19:52.904
Uh, unfortunately.

19:52.904 --> 19:54.841
Aw, man, your friend is awesome.

19:54.841 --> 19:56.244
Uh, my name's Ted Shunim.

19:56.244 --> 19:58.081
- I make reality TV.
- Elz.

19:58.081 --> 19:59.451
I've got this new show.

19:59.451 --> 20:01.922
It's a mental health show
called <i>Nut Haus.</i>

20:01.922 --> 20:04.060
He would be great.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.430
I mean, you could talk to Gata.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.966
He'd do anything
to be famous at this point.

20:06.966 --> 20:08.769
What, I'm supposed to be up here
keeping it real, right?

20:08.769 --> 20:10.440
No need to whisper.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.577
- Right.
- (audience murmuring)

20:12.577 --> 20:14.180
And, um...

20:14.180 --> 20:17.387
uh, Mr. Steer,
you've talked about--

20:17.387 --> 20:19.290
And I never met my dad.

20:19.290 --> 20:21.929
And I call my aunt my mom
because she raised me.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.599
Oh.

20:23.599 --> 20:26.438
- GATA: That shit
kills me every day.
- Mm.

20:26.438 --> 20:28.943
I'm not gonna allow y'all
to sit up here and judge me.

20:28.943 --> 20:31.782
Only God can judge me.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.552
That's cognitive dissonance.

20:33.552 --> 20:36.124
- That's beautiful.
- (applause)

20:38.663 --> 20:41.435
Thank you so much
for sharing that with us.

20:41.435 --> 20:43.773
He's gonna be famous.

20:45.309 --> 20:46.845
I want to save the Earth, too,
Al, I really do,

20:46.845 --> 20:49.016
but, like, Don Cheadle's here,
Harlow-- (stammers)

20:49.016 --> 20:51.455
It's like, it's a lot.
It's an overwhelming situation.

20:51.455 --> 20:53.693
<i>ALLY:
Look, it's not a lost cause.</i>

20:53.693 --> 20:56.164
<i>Because the most visible
picture at this thing</i>

20:56.164 --> 20:57.967
<i>is always the bathroom selfie.</i>

20:57.967 --> 21:00.373
I have no idea what that means.
What is the bathroom selfie?

21:00.373 --> 21:02.377
<i>Every year the coolest celebs</i>

21:02.377 --> 21:03.946
<i>go to the bathroom
at the same time</i>

21:03.946 --> 21:05.483
- and take a selfie.
- (sighs)

21:05.483 --> 21:07.152
<i>You've got to find out
when they're doing it,</i>

21:07.152 --> 21:08.689
get in there and pull that cord.

21:08.689 --> 21:10.393
Well, how does it,
how do I do that?

21:10.393 --> 21:11.795
- I don't know how
that fucking shit works.
- Um...

21:11.795 --> 21:14.735
excuse me, do you,
do you mind if I, um...

21:14.735 --> 21:17.674
just, uh, plug in here?

21:17.674 --> 21:20.145
Thanks, Olaf, bye.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.815
- Is that okay? Okay.
- Yeah.

21:21.815 --> 21:24.353
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Yeah, take a seat.

21:24.353 --> 21:26.458
There's, like, one outlet
in this whole place.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.996
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I could use a seat.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.300
- Whew!
- Whew.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.038
Oh, that feels better.

21:33.038 --> 21:35.308
(exhales)

21:36.512 --> 21:37.814
You okay?

21:37.814 --> 21:39.484
Yeah, just...

21:39.484 --> 21:41.855
- can't see anything
with this thing on.
- Oh, yeah.

21:41.855 --> 21:43.324
I'm Rachel.

21:43.324 --> 21:44.394
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hi.

21:44.394 --> 21:45.463
I'm Dave. Nice to meet you.

21:45.463 --> 21:47.199
Dave, nice to meet you.

21:47.199 --> 21:49.036
You having fun?

21:49.036 --> 21:51.742
Uh, not particularly.

21:51.742 --> 21:53.546
- (laughs): No.
- To be frank with you, no.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.917
It's my first Met Gala,
and it's just not going

21:55.917 --> 21:57.987
anywhere close
to how I envisioned it.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.760
Hey, honestly, these things
really stress me out.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.764
- Yeah?
- I only came,
my publicist forced me,

22:02.764 --> 22:04.935
so I could promote
my next movie.

22:04.935 --> 22:07.374
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

22:07.374 --> 22:08.576
I will go see that movie.

22:08.576 --> 22:10.546
So the promotion
actually worked.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.719
Tell your publicist you've got
one customer locked in

22:13.719 --> 22:15.021
to go see that new film.

22:15.021 --> 22:16.425
- All right, I will...
- Yeah.

22:16.425 --> 22:18.294
- I'm gonna let her know,
thank you.
- Yeah.

22:18.294 --> 22:19.931
My publicist made me
come here, too.

22:19.931 --> 22:22.771
- Really?
- Yeah, I've got
a publicist, as well.

22:22.771 --> 22:24.408
What do you do, Dave?

22:24.408 --> 22:26.812
I'm a rapper.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.582
- Yeah.
- A rapper?

22:28.582 --> 22:30.586
- Cool, right?
- Very.

22:30.586 --> 22:33.526
- Yeah.
- So, like, you could write
a rap about us

22:33.526 --> 22:37.132
meeting like losers
on the ground.

22:37.132 --> 22:39.003
Couple of people chitchatting,
sitting Indian style.

22:39.003 --> 22:40.807
I would knock it
out of the park.

22:40.807 --> 22:42.510
(laughing)

22:42.510 --> 22:44.648
I'm really bummed
that you're not having fun

22:44.648 --> 22:46.819
- at your first Met Ball.
- Uh, well...

22:46.819 --> 22:48.354
What can we do
to turn that around?

22:48.354 --> 22:49.925
How can we make it better?

22:49.925 --> 22:52.329
I mean, do you know anything

22:52.329 --> 22:54.434
about this
bathroom selfie thing?

22:54.434 --> 22:55.937
I feel so lame asking that.

22:55.937 --> 22:57.306
No, don't feel lame.

22:57.306 --> 22:58.776
I felt the exact same way.

22:58.776 --> 23:00.546
You just need someone
to get the ball rolling.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.884
- Okay.
- So I'm gonna
corral everybody up.

23:02.884 --> 23:05.188
And you're gonna go
to the bathroom.

23:05.188 --> 23:08.496
Everyone comes in, and it's
gonna down just like that.

23:08.496 --> 23:09.931
You really have
that kind of influence, huh?

23:09.931 --> 23:11.602
I got them eating
out of the palm of my hand.

23:11.602 --> 23:13.672
- Yum, yum, yum.
- Ah!

23:13.672 --> 23:15.977
- Are you gonna be
in this picture with me?
- No, God no.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.181
No, no, no. I don't take
pictures in bathrooms anymore.

23:18.181 --> 23:20.686
The elephant in the room is,
like, getting up is gonna be,

23:20.686 --> 23:22.690
like, borderline impossible
in this outfit.

23:22.690 --> 23:24.226
- Really?
- Yeah, will you help me up?

23:24.226 --> 23:25.997
I can't.

23:25.997 --> 23:27.500
I was hoping you would help me.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.969
Ah, let's combine...

23:28.969 --> 23:31.441
- the inertia of...
- Where are our publicists?

23:31.441 --> 23:33.278
I know. Here, we can...

23:33.278 --> 23:35.383
if we just... (grunts)

23:35.383 --> 23:37.420
- (screams)
- I got you.

23:37.420 --> 23:39.356
- Sorry, sorry. Yes, I'm up.
- You okay?

23:39.356 --> 23:41.127
- (laughs)
- Should we do the plan now?

23:41.127 --> 23:42.329
Yes.

23:42.329 --> 23:43.933
- Okay, copy you.
- Okay.

23:43.933 --> 23:45.903
- Copying that.
- Rachel's on the move.

23:45.903 --> 23:48.041
- Roger, you.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom downstairs.

23:48.041 --> 23:49.377
- Okay, yes.
- Across the hall.

23:49.377 --> 23:51.314
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- Third door. Okay.

24:13.057 --> 24:16.498
No, that's what I'm saying, I
just did it a couple hours ago.

24:17.467 --> 24:20.272
Just handle it, please.
Jesus Christ.

24:20.272 --> 24:23.178
So I need you
to get in there and--

24:23.178 --> 24:24.881
Hang on a second.

24:29.023 --> 24:30.626
Okay, yeah.

24:30.626 --> 24:32.730
I need somebody to get in there
and get rid of it, okay?

24:32.730 --> 24:35.068
Get it out of there
before it opens tomorrow.

24:35.068 --> 24:38.409
Yeah, big red letters
right by the crown.

24:38.409 --> 24:40.011
Yeah, on the inside, Carla,
you think

24:40.011 --> 24:42.450
I scaled the outside of
the fucking Statue of Liberty?

24:42.450 --> 24:44.353
No, you don't yell at me, okay?

24:44.353 --> 24:45.923
This is your fucking job!

24:45.923 --> 24:47.359
It's what I pay you for.

24:47.359 --> 24:49.363
Why do you need to know
what it says?

24:49.363 --> 24:50.766
It doesn't matter what it sa--

24:50.766 --> 24:52.904
It says "fuck white people,"
okay?

24:52.904 --> 24:54.608
Just get--

24:54.608 --> 24:57.513
No, I wasn't on fentanyl again.
Jesus Christ.

24:57.513 --> 24:59.851
(whispers):
"Fentanyl"?

24:59.851 --> 25:01.989
(stammers)

25:10.238 --> 25:12.142
Fuck.

25:34.854 --> 25:36.925
(whistles)

25:39.431 --> 25:41.969
- (overlapping conversations)
- You crushed it out there.
- Thank you.

25:41.969 --> 25:44.006
- So I'm saying it's like,
it's like pickleball.
- Yeah.

25:44.006 --> 25:45.776
- But it's better
than pickleball.
- Okay.

25:45.776 --> 25:48.181
CHEADLE: Because you can,
you don't have to be dressed.

25:48.181 --> 25:50.051
- Right, that's true.
- Exactly.

25:50.051 --> 25:52.724
KELLY:
Dude, this has become
my favorite part.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.594
- Let's do the selfie.
- Up yours.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.097
(indistinct chatter)

25:56.097 --> 25:58.602
Man, that food sucked.

25:58.602 --> 26:00.305
Whoo!
We look good, baby.

26:00.305 --> 26:02.009
- Let's do it.
- (toilet flushes)

26:03.512 --> 26:05.750
- Selfie time?
- What the fuck?

26:05.750 --> 26:07.319
Whoa.

26:07.319 --> 26:09.189
DAVE:
No?

26:09.189 --> 26:11.060
Wait... (chuckles)

26:11.060 --> 26:13.231
Are we doing
the bathroom selfie, no?

26:13.231 --> 26:15.636
Were you waiting in the stall
for the selfie?

26:15.636 --> 26:17.640
- (laughter)
- DAVE: No.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.811
If you must know,
I was taking a shit.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.147
So...

26:21.147 --> 26:23.117
- Ah.
- Ew.

26:23.117 --> 26:25.121
Shitting, he says.

26:25.121 --> 26:27.927
(sniffing)

26:31.334 --> 26:33.839
It's fine, guys.

26:35.943 --> 26:37.613
Yeah, uh...

26:37.613 --> 26:39.951
I don't think this guy
was taking a shit.

26:39.951 --> 26:41.087
Wow.

26:41.087 --> 26:42.724
And I'm from Kentucky,
so I know shit.

26:42.724 --> 26:44.995
- That's facts.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he does.

26:44.995 --> 26:46.665
What? What the fuck
does that even mean?

26:46.665 --> 26:48.902
Why would you lie about that?
That's so lame.

26:48.902 --> 26:50.906
I'm not lying.

26:50.906 --> 26:52.844
Do you guys want to smell
my asshole for proof?

26:52.844 --> 26:55.081
- Uh, what do you want?
- No, gross.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.219
- FOX: Ew!
- I'm sorry.
- Ugh.

26:57.219 --> 26:59.624
Criticism aside, I owe you
an apology from Germany.

26:59.624 --> 27:01.895
I am sorry about what happened.

27:01.895 --> 27:03.732
I don't blame you for the
Holocaust just 'cause you're

27:03.732 --> 27:05.936
- a tall Aryan guy.
- That's not at all
what I'm talking about.

27:05.936 --> 27:07.707
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:07.707 --> 27:09.243
I've never even been
to Europe, dude.

27:09.243 --> 27:10.513
Oh! You've never been to Europe?

27:10.513 --> 27:12.349
- Wow.
- Whoa.
- Really?

27:12.349 --> 27:13.585
HARLOW:
Oh, God.

27:13.585 --> 27:15.221
You would love Europe.

27:15.221 --> 27:17.259
Okay, you don't know
anything about me.

27:17.259 --> 27:19.163
None of us do.

27:19.163 --> 27:22.002
BARKER: You guys,
shut the fuck up, let's take

27:22.002 --> 27:24.106

27:24.106 --> 27:25.443

Why don't you guys stand
right next to me, no, stand

27:28.882 --> 27:30.853

Stand right next to me.

27:30.853 --> 27:32.924

27:32.924 --> 27:34.694
Yeah.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.600
- Okay, remember... Okay.
- You're gonna remember
this shit forever.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.171
- Whole world's gonna
see this shit.
- KELLY: All right.

27:40.171 --> 27:42.008
All right, so, uh,

27:42.008 --> 27:43.946

27:51.661 --> 27:53.665

- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

27:53.665 --> 27:55.536
Sorry. (grunting) One more.

27:55.536 --> 27:57.139
Oh, sorry.

27:57.139 --> 27:59.243
You said you didn't want to be
in the bathroom selfie.

27:59.243 --> 28:00.679
Oh, well, well,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.550

- KELLY: Yes, sir!

28:17.212 --> 28:18.982
CHEADLE: All right, I'm gonna go
hang out with some Black people.

28:18.982 --> 28:21.588
Man, that was an exhilarating
mission, wasn't it?

28:21.588 --> 28:22.790
Uh, yeah.
