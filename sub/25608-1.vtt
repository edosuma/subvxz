00:23.224 --> 00:28.172
Okay, so this is
Test Subject X-119,

00:28.196 --> 00:31.465
in Hebrew block 614, Trial 5.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.513
Take the cleaver
and strike the object.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.973
Take the cleaver
and strike the object.

01:55.183 --> 01:58.486
Take the cleaver
and strike the object.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.386
This one.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.054
It's ready.

02:40.461 --> 02:44.498
On the 19th of October, 2022,

02:45.333 --> 02:47.968
the world changed...

02:49.270 --> 02:50.438
forever.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.353
No one knew
who had launched first.

02:56.377 --> 03:02.226
No one knew why they fell on remote
areas, Ohio, and not New York,

03:02.250 --> 03:04.994
Calais, and not Paris,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.355
Yorkshire, and not London.

03:10.123 --> 03:14.895
No one realized the bio-power
plants were being targeted.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.904
All the beauty of
the Northern hemisphere...

03:27.975 --> 03:29.009
gone.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.923
Radiation from
the nuclear fallout

03:33.947 --> 03:37.651
spawned a bacteria
that spread south,

03:38.286 --> 03:40.521
killing everything.

03:42.323 --> 03:45.201
Thus war came and went
in the south

03:45.225 --> 03:47.628
and society broke down.

03:53.401 --> 03:57.671
The spurt of humanity
struggled to rise...

03:59.873 --> 04:01.074
again.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.170
What the hell is that?

08:10.591 --> 08:12.325
Six people.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.228
No masks.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.299
Taking water from the river.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.746
You know, maybe you're right.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.873
Maybe the bacteria hasn't come
this far of south.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.372
Did you see, Bug?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.379
Oh, I know you like it here.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.993
Yeah, I'll get you some help.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.340
Says we're here...

09:36.276 --> 09:37.444
and they're here.

09:46.053 --> 09:50.700
Now, I understand
why you're going.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.101
You wanna take control
of your life,

09:52.125 --> 09:55.004
you wanna take control
of your situation.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.832
What I don't understand is why you're
not doing that right now, right here.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.034
Why don't you breathe?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.780
Breathe...

10:06.006 --> 10:06.940
Good.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.043
Control.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.314
Reach around and grab my ankle.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.388
I know this is a difficult
time for you, Jake...

10:23.123 --> 10:24.825
...but you're
not finished yet.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.233
Master Crane.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.780
I need to be with her, you know.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.748
Been away from Molly
far too long.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.842
You got the next one?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.754
You're with us in spirit...

10:44.778 --> 10:46.947
Despite of my feelings, Jake...

10:53.787 --> 10:54.955
I'm proud of you.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.129
You're free to choose, you know.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.464
You just have to submit.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.334
There's no choice.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.439
Thank you.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.012
Hey, little Bug.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.625
Time for Mommy to help change
those diapers, isn't it?

11:33.460 --> 11:34.971
Look at you, holding a baby.

11:34.995 --> 11:38.474
Daddy's had enough
of that goofy smile.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.910
When you first came in here, you
couldn't hold a glass of water

11:40.934 --> 11:43.303
without getting it all
over you, you remember?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.184
The other kid, she's gonna be...

11:48.208 --> 11:51.420
That is gonna be
one special kid.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.314
Her parents are two of the most
stubborn people I've ever met.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.126
Thank God her mom is brilliant.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.563
That's why I need to get my
two girls back together.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.290
She's been away from her mother
for far too long. Haven't you?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.201
Little Bug.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
Come on.
Let's put you down.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.237
Heads up.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.478
Control this.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.804
Is it dead?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.231
It is now.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.677
Ugh. Smells like ass!

12:48.701 --> 12:49.970
We need to make this quick.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.715
I was starting to think
you guys bailed on me.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.985
Why? And give up
on all this?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.044
What you got there?

13:31.611 --> 13:32.745
Dinner.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.646
A hospital?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.322
Oh, again, come on.

14:16.890 --> 14:17.833
Ah!
See.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.069
Baseball, baseball takes
all day.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.637
All day? I fall asleep
in the second innings.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.740
This, from a man who used to play
a sport that takes five days,

14:24.764 --> 14:26.009
sometimes even a month.
Cricket.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.510
Cricket has all different
kinds of approaches.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.112
There's all different
kinds of bowlers...

14:29.136 --> 14:31.280
I'd rather lick
my grandmother's feet.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.715
Your grandmother...
Hey, stop!

14:32.739 --> 14:33.740
Stop right there!

14:38.111 --> 14:39.555
Stop!
Hey, hey, hey.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.457
Stop right where you are.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.617
What is in the package?
What is in the package?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.462
I need a doctor.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.507
Why is he wearing a mask?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.519
She's breathing...

15:43.943 --> 15:45.245
Look around.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.519
You won't be
needing that anymore.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.551
What is this place?

16:15.575 --> 16:16.609
Well...

16:18.811 --> 16:20.280
it's home...

16:21.114 --> 16:22.582
to many.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.584
Who are you?

16:25.785 --> 16:27.254
I'm Dr. Harris.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.323
My daughter...

16:31.191 --> 16:32.525
she's sick.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.141
How long has she been like this?

16:38.165 --> 16:39.608
How old is she?

16:39.632 --> 16:40.833
Since the flash.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.569
She's eight.

16:44.804 --> 16:45.838
And you are?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.208
Jake.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.354
My name is Jake.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.712
Is this a hospital?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.058
Of sorts.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.384
I must say, Jake,
you're a lucky man.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.319
We can help her.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.322
And you.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.259
We're rebuilding here.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.038
Getting people a home,

17:09.061 --> 17:10.297
security,

17:11.098 --> 17:12.398
sense of purpose.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.679
The transport is minimal.
Only what we could salvage.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.359
Do you have electricity?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.361
It's battery, mostly.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.631
We've had to rebuild
since the AMP,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.690
but yes, we have what we need.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.693
The lightning?
The flash?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.241
It was an electromagnetic pulse.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.375
That's right.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.377
It came from that tower.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.814
Clearly, by the mask,
you're aware of the bacteria.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.407
I was following
the signal from the south.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.509
Said there was a cure.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.912
Also from our tower.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.195
Population was decimated
by the bacteria.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.298
We were able to
save these people.

18:09.322 --> 18:15.795
The EMP delivered software directly
into the brain of the survivors.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.532
Mr. Jake,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.701
it's all electricity.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.741
Sit down. Make
yourselves comfortable.

18:30.977 --> 18:31.911
Okay.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.419
Now keep your head still,

18:40.987 --> 18:42.389
and look at this.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.038
Unfortunately,

18:50.062 --> 18:54.834
after the pulse, there were
unintended consequences.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.637
Molly.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.675
How often does this happen?

19:04.344 --> 19:05.845
Every couple of days.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.327
I need another nurse here.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.162
We need to take her inside.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.830
No. No, she's not
going anywhere.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.733
We have, uh, more facilities.
No.

19:17.757 --> 19:22.004
Jake, it's been two years
since the pulse.

19:22.028 --> 19:26.141
How long have you been out there
scavenging, and on your own?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.067
You found doctors.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.737
We can help you both.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.450
We need to take her inside.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.285
I go where she goes.
Okay.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.345
No exceptions.
Okay.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.647
Let's attend to you first.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.948
Please.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.230
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.566
Anesthetic for the pain.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.792
We're just gonna
clean you up, okay?

19:56.396 --> 19:59.832
He is in a remarkably good shape

20:00.900 --> 20:05.714
for someone who has been
like this for two years.

20:05.738 --> 20:09.017
She hasn't changed.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.610
She hasn't changed.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.556
We're gonna need
the life support.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.081
What did you do to me?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.031
Feel like going for a climb?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.946
Did you eat junk food
or something lately, Bug?

22:17.970 --> 22:18.871
Higher.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.719
Your mother was the tall one.
I'm at full stretch here.

22:23.743 --> 22:27.322
It'll hopefully grow where I could fit
through a hole the size of a golf ball...

22:27.346 --> 22:28.848
What are you trying to say...

22:38.257 --> 22:40.202
What do we have here?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.268
Dad!

23:49.295 --> 23:51.030
It's a nice jacket, asshole.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.251
Get out of the way.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.955
Nice one, Bug.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.102
Did you find the food?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.106
Enough for a month.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.586
Molly.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.221
The ladder. You see it?

24:39.245 --> 24:40.680
I'm on it.

24:48.387 --> 24:51.867
No, no, no, come back, come back, come
back. Come on, come on, come back.

24:51.891 --> 24:55.638
You gotta jump, baby.
You gotta jump. Molly, please.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.265
You come one inch close and I will
fucking kill you, I swear to God.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.743
Molly.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.268
I don't wanna jump.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.136
Trust me, Bug.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.369
Who are you?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.415
Let me go.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.717
She was six years old...

25:41.741 --> 25:43.042
Let me go!

25:45.712 --> 25:46.989
She had red hair...

25:47.013 --> 25:47.790
Molly.

25:47.814 --> 25:48.891
Where's Molly?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.382
What have you done to her?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.121
What is that?

25:55.788 --> 25:56.956
Is that her?

26:00.292 --> 26:01.427
No!

26:03.730 --> 26:05.307
<i>♪ London Bridge
Is falling down ♪</i>

26:05.331 --> 26:06.966
<i>♪ My fair lady</i>

26:10.402 --> 26:12.180
She had red hair, you see?

26:12.204 --> 26:13.215
Red hair.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.184
You need to find and see.
You need to get out.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.519
Go on. Run.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.745
They just saw me.

26:26.653 --> 26:27.963
What have you done to her?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.865
Stop singing and
tell me where she is.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.131
I'm so sorry.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.778
But I'll see you soon.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.380
Tell me where the fuck
my daughter is!

26:47.506 --> 26:48.540
Find the girl.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.586
She's in danger.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.945
They'll kill her.

26:53.579 --> 26:54.881
Follow the map.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.759
Find MadCap.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.326
Ahh...

26:58.350 --> 27:00.319
Find MadCap.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.264
Ahh...

27:07.860 --> 27:09.872
Where... Where is she?
Wait, wait.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.230
Wait, wait, wait.
What did you see?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.065
Come on, no!

27:17.169 --> 27:18.237
God.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.319
Slowly...

28:45.892 --> 28:47.736
You're early.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.096
It's like an hour
until shift change.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.066
You can't be back there.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.644
You got a key for this?

28:56.668 --> 28:57.970
Of course I got...

28:58.337 --> 28:59.305
Wait.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.975
You're not Jenkins.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.630
No!

29:44.116 --> 29:45.451
You see something?

29:47.653 --> 29:50.189
I see your royal flush.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.550
Whoa!

30:08.574 --> 30:10.352
Who the hell are you?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.220
Today is Tuesday, right?

30:12.244 --> 30:13.521
Is this some kind of a joke?

30:13.545 --> 30:16.224
I don't think so.
I'm not very funny.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.060
We turn down just up here.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.461
How do you turn...
Go!

30:20.486 --> 30:21.387
Whoo!

30:42.674 --> 30:44.987
Yo, people do that for fun...

30:46.678 --> 30:47.789
Ow, ow, ow, no!

30:47.813 --> 30:49.057
No, no, no. No, no, please.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.526
She sent you.
She sent you. The lady.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.694
She sent you to MadCap.

30:52.718 --> 30:53.996
Yeah.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.264
Follow the map to find MadCap.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.466
Okay. I just need
to get something from here.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.935
Dammit. Get off me.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.603
Get off me!

31:11.637 --> 31:12.704
Okay...

31:14.974 --> 31:16.885
Okay.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.445
Wait. You need to
come with me.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.190
Yeah. To the Resistance Camp.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.126
Yeah, you'll be safe.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.593
It's what they said.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.330
No, you're right, of course.
You're not safe.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.532
Because they've seen you,
you'll never be safe.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.700
But you gotta believe me,
my people can help.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.627
They spend their days working on
ways to circumvent the virus.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.241
The virus?
Yeah, the virus.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.976
The reins. The control.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.344
The bacteria.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.204
You're kidding. No. Not
the bacteria, the virus.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.074
You have no idea.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.280
They will never stop hunting you.
Hunting her.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.416
You can't outrun them
carrying her.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.385
Please, come with me.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.030
I promise you'll be safe.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.389
Come on, let's go.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.013
See, they call me MadCap...
I don't care.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.214
Right.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.416
The virus is like
nothing you've...

32:21.440 --> 32:24.810
Is that what that crazy woman was
trying to warn me about before she died?

32:25.177 --> 32:26.378
She died?

32:30.016 --> 32:31.150
Yeah.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.454
She a friend of yours?

32:36.888 --> 32:38.733
Yeah. A friend to many.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.891
Her name was Brooke.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.609
Hey... I just need
to check her eyes.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.600
Yeah.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.743
It's the virus.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.181
The same virus
that killed your friend?

33:02.914 --> 33:04.159
Molly's got it?

33:04.183 --> 33:05.817
Yeah, everyone's got it.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.220
Weird thing is you don't.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.632
The virus is a software.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.524
It was transmitted
from the tower.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.170
The flash.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.771
They said that was
the immunization.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.341
Yeah, well, yeah.
The EMP did, in fact,

33:19.365 --> 33:21.309
carry an immunization
to the bacteria,

33:21.333 --> 33:22.677
but it was just a cover.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.047
A virus was what they
wanted to deliver.

33:25.071 --> 33:28.383
It lives inside the brain and
makes us do whatever they want.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.784
That's impossible.

33:29.808 --> 33:30.752
Is it?

33:30.776 --> 33:32.811
You've already seen it
when you arrived.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.791
See, the brain is electrical
like a computer.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.462
Uh, when the nukes wiped out
the top half of the world,

33:40.486 --> 33:43.098
and the bacteria migrated south,

33:43.122 --> 33:45.467
society just tore itself apart,

33:45.491 --> 33:48.270
the order steeped in
to control the chaos.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.304
Is that not a good thing?

33:49.328 --> 33:50.805
No, not the way they did it.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.508
See, as far as we
can tell, they immunized us

33:53.532 --> 33:56.044
by making our brains, uh...

33:56.068 --> 33:59.447
stimulate an over-production of
ATP, which is a tendency to...

33:59.471 --> 34:01.216
I know what ATP is.
ATP...

34:01.240 --> 34:02.617
It seems to
counteract the bacteria.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.643
I mean, that's
ingenious, really.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.880
But they also delivered
software right into our brain.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.750
But no one controls me.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.895
Yeah.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.431
That's why you and your
daughter are so valuable.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.224
Somehow you're immune.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.735
What about Molly?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.070
You're strange enough.
You don't have the virus.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.539
But little Clare, she...
Molly.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.340
Yeah, right.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.474
But right now,
we need your help.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.009
You said you could help us.

34:28.033 --> 34:32.313
And I can. I... The
tower transmits a control signal.

34:32.338 --> 34:35.117
Also, that's how they
control the population.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.819
Also, it has to be destroyed.

34:37.842 --> 34:38.920
Also...

34:38.944 --> 34:39.945
Also?

34:41.147 --> 34:42.790
Also?

34:42.813 --> 34:45.127
Also, you're the only one
who can destroy it.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.393
They don't control you.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.929
We gotta keep moving.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.232
Hey, what do you mean I'm the
only one who can destroy it?

34:50.255 --> 34:53.400
Well, see this,
this gives me a moment.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.661
Not long enough to willingly
destroy the tower.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.596
It has to be you.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.598
Get your hands off me.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.439
It's this way.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.491
Okay, try it again.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.687
Now punch in the other one.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.372
Yeah, that's it.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.398
All right. How does
that feel, Max?

35:41.840 --> 35:44.810
You have a call from
the General, ma'am.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.047
Okay, we're here.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.360
I thought you were
taking me to your camp.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.128
Yeah, I am.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.331
The Resistance Camp.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.833
I just need to grab
something from here first.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.202
It's my secret lair.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.003
If this is a trap,
I will kill you.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.505
Hey, I don't doubt it.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.242
You're still alive.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.500
Okay.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.538
Here we are.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.344
Great, huh?

36:19.245 --> 36:20.455
I love these shapes.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.390
You like limestone?
Temple Limestone.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.715
I love limestone.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.417
Okay.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.397
Just let me...

36:29.421 --> 36:30.822
Just keep this away.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.906
You can just put her down here.

36:38.930 --> 36:39.898
Just be a minute.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.442
You hear that, Bug?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.711
We're gonna get you some help.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.715
I'm never gonna let you
out of my sight again.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.861
Over the last year,

36:59.885 --> 37:03.855
we've been able to plant a series
of bombs on the transmission tower.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.903
Unfortunately,
the last guy got caught

37:08.927 --> 37:11.630
and fortunately,
he's found his way out.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.902
So, yeah. They still don't
know why he was there.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.005
He, uh...

37:20.806 --> 37:22.007
He resisted...

37:22.874 --> 37:24.075
right till the end.

37:24.743 --> 37:25.811
Uh...

37:26.578 --> 37:28.179
Just gotta find...

37:29.315 --> 37:30.482
a detonator.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.119
Okay, here we are.

37:35.721 --> 37:39.000
I built this to
detonate remotely,

37:39.024 --> 37:42.193
but the virus stops me
getting close enough to use it.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.729
But...

37:44.396 --> 37:45.840
you, I mean,

37:45.864 --> 37:47.098
you could do it.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.454
Whoa. Careful with that.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.912
Careful. Careful.
What is this?

38:02.681 --> 38:03.682
This...

38:04.616 --> 38:06.652
This is the most
valuable thing of all.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.923
This is freewill.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.700
Okay.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.548
You see, everything that happens

38:26.572 --> 38:27.915
comes from something else.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.485
You know, like an asteroid
bumps into some space-dust,

38:30.509 --> 38:32.253
and then bumps into
some more space-dust,

38:32.277 --> 38:33.855
and eventually forms a planet...

38:33.879 --> 38:35.690
Sounds like it's gonna
be a long story.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.258
No, just think about it.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.461
You know, cause and effect, all
the way back to the Big Bang.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.628
That's where we're different.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.431
I mean, this world,
this pale blue dot.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.200
We're not the product of
what came before.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.635
We can choose what comes next.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.070
Good job we've done with that.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.738
There've been
some bad choices, I know,

38:50.762 --> 38:53.274
but at least
they're ours to make.

38:53.298 --> 38:54.542
I mean, they have to be.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.811
And that's what the Order's
taken from us.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.746
They've taken
our right to choose.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.448
What, with the virus?

39:00.472 --> 39:04.586
Yeah. I've discovered that we could
communicate without being detected

39:04.610 --> 39:06.421
if we think one thing

39:06.445 --> 39:09.123
and then say or do another.

39:09.147 --> 39:09.924
You know, like,

39:09.948 --> 39:11.693
holding a conversation
while, um,

39:11.717 --> 39:13.752
I don't know, playing
a guitar, you know.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.131
We usually sing nursery rhymes,

39:17.155 --> 39:20.635
but, I mean, to act directly
against the order,

39:20.659 --> 39:22.036
I gotta use this.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.605
See, the... the jolt

39:23.629 --> 39:25.940
short-circuits the virus
temporarily.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.700
But it's not
a long-term solution.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.612
Why?

39:30.636 --> 39:32.571
We're almost out of batteries.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.174
You sure it's a virus?

39:37.075 --> 39:37.943
Yeah.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.748
Could it wake up Molly?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.051
Uh...

39:47.519 --> 39:48.687
Yeah.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.288
Probably. Uh...

39:51.557 --> 39:54.802
Yeah, I mean,
someone her size, it, uh...

39:54.826 --> 39:57.304
It might completely
destroy the virus.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.206
Yeah. It's worth a shot.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.575
It shouldn't kill her.

40:00.599 --> 40:01.709
Kill her?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.134
Uh, yeah.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.236
Yeah. That's...

40:06.772 --> 40:08.940
Don't wanna kill
the last child on earth.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.777
What did you say?

40:14.279 --> 40:15.213
The...

40:16.948 --> 40:17.983
The last...

40:20.586 --> 40:22.163
Wow. You...

40:22.187 --> 40:24.289
You really didn't get
the memo, did you?

40:27.893 --> 40:28.860
Um...

40:30.161 --> 40:32.063
The EMP, uh...

40:32.598 --> 40:33.799
it...

40:38.670 --> 40:40.138
It killed all the children.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.251
What?

40:44.275 --> 40:46.878
Yeah. When it went off, uh...

40:48.346 --> 40:50.048
anyone too young to take the...

40:50.516 --> 40:51.817
they just, uh...

40:53.619 --> 40:54.786
All but her.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.765
You see, that's why
they won't stop.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.090
Why they won't ever stop.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.995
She's a holy grail, Jake.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.398
That's why you have to help us.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.919
Unintended consequences.

41:17.943 --> 41:20.221
You know, they say they
want to build civilization,

41:20.245 --> 41:24.125
but, I mean, isn't the first
step having more children?

41:24.149 --> 41:28.253
You know, there have been no
newborns since the pulse.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.757
No births in two years.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.827
And people are
disappearing, Jake.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.766
I don't know what it is,
but they're up to something.

41:41.533 --> 41:42.901
They're up to something.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.583
You know, they said
that they can help her,

41:48.607 --> 41:50.852
and they tried to drill
into her brain.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.854
When you say that you can help,

41:52.878 --> 41:54.345
you're trying
to blow up the tower.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.348
I'm being used.
That is it.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.296
What? No, no. No. No.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.371
There another way out?

42:10.395 --> 42:11.362
You mean like a secret way?

42:12.631 --> 42:13.641
Nope.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.366
There's a gas mask in my pack.

42:16.467 --> 42:17.612
All right, you keep her safe.

42:17.636 --> 42:18.804
Okay. Got it.

42:33.484 --> 42:34.419
What are you doing?

42:35.320 --> 42:36.230
Keeping her safe.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.498
Put her down!

43:06.184 --> 43:07.185
Protect...

43:15.727 --> 43:16.862
MadCap!

43:17.629 --> 43:19.197
Meet me at the bridge.

43:21.332 --> 43:22.400
MadCap!

43:30.241 --> 43:32.077
MadCap!

43:40.385 --> 43:42.520
MadCap!

44:03.041 --> 44:05.110
You like cheddar
more than blue, huh?

44:05.944 --> 44:07.846
News from above?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.249
He wants the damn thing
to go out tomorrow.

44:11.817 --> 44:13.094
Close it up.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.128
Tomorrow?

44:14.152 --> 44:15.362
But that's impossible.
It can't be done.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.564
There's still so much
testing to do.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.590
It can be done and it will be.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.161
Get another rat.

44:24.963 --> 44:26.998
Find coffee. It's gonna
be a long night.

44:30.401 --> 44:31.536
Sorry, Max.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.486
Ow. Ow.

45:02.734 --> 45:03.869
What have you here?

46:07.132 --> 46:09.376
Go install this in the device.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.712
But I'm not supposed to...
Just do it.

46:11.736 --> 46:13.680
This has to get up by morning.

46:13.704 --> 46:16.474
The General was very explicit.

46:21.612 --> 46:22.680
And, Gavin,

46:23.915 --> 46:25.383
get another rat.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.193
I'm not sure if this is the...

47:27.778 --> 47:29.090
Enough!

47:32.017 --> 47:33.727
Enough!

47:46.064 --> 47:47.498
Are you okay?

47:58.809 --> 48:01.079
This is gonna sting.

48:17.963 --> 48:19.230
Tell me.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.773
I'm not sure.

48:35.346 --> 48:36.614
Looks like it's worked.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.515
Stop right there!

49:11.949 --> 49:13.151
He's still coming.

49:13.718 --> 49:14.785
How's he doing that?

49:18.556 --> 49:20.491
What are you doing?
They'll see you.

49:21.859 --> 49:22.970
I need your help.

49:22.994 --> 49:24.405
How'd you do that?

49:24.429 --> 49:26.464
MadCap is in there
with my daughter.

49:27.532 --> 49:29.300
You need to help me find them.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.337
Daughter?

49:34.039 --> 49:36.917
So it's true.

49:36.941 --> 49:40.654
If she's here, they will have taken
her to the tunnels under the tower

49:40.678 --> 49:43.714
where they experiment on
anyone different.

49:44.582 --> 49:45.616
Experiment?

49:48.653 --> 49:51.132
Here. Take this.

49:51.156 --> 49:52.899
It's not all mapped out, but...

50:02.900 --> 50:04.111
You okay?

50:04.135 --> 50:05.812
When you find MadCap,

50:05.836 --> 50:07.714
tell him 31...

50:07.738 --> 50:11.685
Tell him 312, right
where the drains go through.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.378
Go! Go!

50:24.555 --> 50:26.224
Tell me about your home.

50:28.593 --> 50:31.329
How was your life
before the war?

50:32.063 --> 50:33.631
Did you have...

50:34.832 --> 50:35.933
a family?

50:37.868 --> 50:38.803
Hmm?

50:40.971 --> 50:42.840
I'll never tell you anything.

50:44.909 --> 50:46.511
You just did.

50:52.117 --> 50:54.885
We can now see
anything you think.

50:58.923 --> 50:59.957
Shit.

51:08.766 --> 51:12.546
<i>♪ My grandfather's clock
Was too large for the shelf ♪</i>

51:12.570 --> 51:16.150
<i>♪ My grandfather's clock
Was too large for the shelf ♪</i>

51:16.174 --> 51:18.152
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

51:18.176 --> 51:20.621
Back, back, back.

51:20.645 --> 51:21.746
Right there.

51:25.950 --> 51:27.128
Erase it.

51:27.152 --> 51:28.629
Erase. Erase it all.

51:28.653 --> 51:29.863
The General's gonna want this.

51:29.887 --> 51:32.499
The General is gonna
want to test that himself.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.692
Do you want to be
the one to deny him that?

51:39.197 --> 51:40.665
Tell me about the bombs.

51:41.532 --> 51:43.043
They're in the tower.

51:43.067 --> 51:47.714
<i>♪ My grandfather's clock

51:47.738 --> 51:50.475
You... You wanna
blow up the tower?

51:52.277 --> 51:53.920
<i>♪ ...the day that he was born</i>

51:53.944 --> 51:58.159
<i>♪ It was always

51:58.183 --> 52:00.994
Is that what this is for?

52:02.187 --> 52:04.455
That doesn't work anymore.

52:06.257 --> 52:08.635
Trust me.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.138
You don't want
the tower to be destroyed.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.242
It will ruin everything.

52:15.266 --> 52:18.078
<i>♪ ...short, never to go again</i>

52:18.102 --> 52:21.315

52:21.339 --> 52:24.285

52:28.045 --> 52:29.523
No, no, no, no, no.

52:29.547 --> 52:30.957
No, no, no, no, no!

52:30.981 --> 52:32.326
No, no!

52:47.565 --> 52:50.968
This could be so easy
if you just cooperate.

52:51.402 --> 52:52.537
You bitch.

52:53.371 --> 52:55.406
Thank you, Mr. Capper.

52:57.141 --> 52:58.576
Doctor, it's the General.

53:14.425 --> 53:16.427
He wants to disperse it at dawn?

53:17.362 --> 53:19.139
That's in less than an hour.

53:19.163 --> 53:20.365
Hey, no.

53:21.899 --> 53:23.043
Please.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.311
You can't do this.

53:24.335 --> 53:25.646
Please.

53:25.670 --> 53:27.348
Please don't do this.
You can't distribute that.

53:27.372 --> 53:29.082
You can't steal
people's thoughts!

53:29.106 --> 53:30.641
Hey!

53:31.242 --> 53:33.010
Hey!

54:41.045 --> 54:43.614
How many are you? Hmm?

54:45.215 --> 54:50.664
How many traitors are among us?

54:50.688 --> 54:52.165
There's four at the camp,

54:52.189 --> 54:53.734
one of them died,

54:53.758 --> 54:56.202
there's more in another camp.

54:56.226 --> 54:57.828
One of them is a guard.

54:59.864 --> 55:00.974
You know,

55:00.998 --> 55:03.801
we know you found
a way to communicate.

55:05.135 --> 55:08.706
In a few minutes' time,
none of that would matter.

55:12.810 --> 55:16.490
Your friend showing up
like he did

55:16.514 --> 55:20.685
has exonerated matters
considerably.

55:31.596 --> 55:34.641
Your very thoughts betray you.

55:41.205 --> 55:47.111
This update will render
your little workaround...

55:47.878 --> 55:49.055
useless.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.648
It's Bio-S2.

55:51.449 --> 55:52.593
What?

55:52.617 --> 55:54.761
It's called Bio-S2.

55:54.785 --> 55:57.121
It's a biological operating...
It doesn't matter.

56:00.858 --> 56:05.062
How did he avoid infection?

56:38.696 --> 56:41.732
Time to be more persuasive.

56:52.543 --> 56:54.845
Tell me about the girl.

57:00.951 --> 57:02.152
Who is she?

57:04.154 --> 57:05.255
Who is she?

57:06.356 --> 57:08.569
How did she survive?

57:30.147 --> 57:31.649
No!

57:45.462 --> 57:47.373
Jake! Jake!

57:48.566 --> 57:50.043
Man, I just work here!

57:50.067 --> 57:51.211
Where is Molly?

57:51.235 --> 57:52.245
Jake!

57:52.269 --> 57:53.814
Where is Molly?

57:53.838 --> 57:55.081
Jake, what are you doing?

57:55.105 --> 57:56.750
You took her, gave her to them!

57:56.774 --> 57:58.384
What? No, no, no, no!

57:58.408 --> 57:59.886
Where?
The MedLabs,

57:59.910 --> 58:02.122
up the stairs,
at the end of the next hallway.

58:12.156 --> 58:13.634
The Guild took her.

58:13.658 --> 58:15.268
I told you
what I'd do to you if you...

58:15.292 --> 58:16.661
And I believed you.

58:17.461 --> 58:18.829
Look where we are, Jake.

58:25.369 --> 58:27.905
The update doesn't
interest you, Marion?

58:32.543 --> 58:33.678
You know,

58:34.545 --> 58:37.558
I saw something very compelling

58:37.582 --> 58:40.694
on my monitor just now.

58:40.718 --> 58:42.428
You told me he was dead.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.954
Yeah. I thought he was.

58:44.955 --> 58:46.667
They bombed the hospital,

58:46.691 --> 58:49.570
The rehabilitation wing that he was
working in was completely destroyed,

58:49.594 --> 58:51.071
and I looked.
Believe me, I looked.

58:51.095 --> 58:53.931
I could not find...
You saw me easily enough.

58:55.065 --> 58:56.810
Think about
what we have accomplished.

58:56.834 --> 59:00.814
Think about what we've done.
With your research.

59:00.838 --> 59:04.742
We have stopped violence.
We have stopped violence.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.587
Chaos,

59:06.611 --> 59:07.954
the rape of women,

59:07.978 --> 59:11.115
the senseless slaughter of
men, women, children.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.761
We slaughtered the children.

59:14.785 --> 59:18.665
I'm sorry, okay? Don't think a day
doesn't go by that I don't regret that.

59:18.689 --> 59:20.200
I will not let that
happen again.

59:20.224 --> 59:23.503
Well, there are no more children
left to kill, are there?

59:23.527 --> 59:26.439
Look, we can't have an anomaly.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.842
We can't. We can't have some new
resistance to the software.

59:28.866 --> 59:31.945
That man is the only reason
we have any software.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.313
You have no idea what is coming.

59:33.337 --> 59:34.981
Trust me, you have no...
It's all based on his DNA!

59:35.005 --> 59:36.617
We have to go upstairs right now.
We have to go upstairs.

59:36.641 --> 59:38.351
We have to broadcast
the update right now.

59:38.375 --> 59:39.886
Will you come with me, please?

59:39.910 --> 59:42.723
Will you come with me so we can broadcast
the update without resistance?

59:42.747 --> 59:44.591
Please.

59:44.615 --> 59:49.630
Move your ass so we can go
upstairs, and start world peace!

59:49.654 --> 59:50.855
Please?

59:52.723 --> 59:53.934
What happened back there?

59:53.958 --> 59:56.193
You just froze.
Oh, look, ports.

59:59.063 --> 01:00:01.441
So you're saying here that
you're gonna help me find her.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:02.609
Yeah, of course, I will.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:03.910
But we just gotta
get to the tunn...

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.502
Now!

01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:08.248
Look, look.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:11.217
They're gonna release an update to
the virus, like, any minute now.

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:14.655
Okay, which... It allows them to
literally see our thoughts, okay,

01:00:14.679 --> 01:00:18.591
and if that happens, all hope
for the Resistance is lost.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.126
We gotta get to the tower.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.262
I don't care about
your Resistance.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.030
I don't care about your Order.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:27.200
I care about finding Molly and
getting the fuck outta here!

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:29.703
They tested
the update on me. They saw.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.028
They know you're here.

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:33.940
They know about Clare.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.033
Oh my God.
They know about Clare.

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.946
You know what?
I'll do it myself.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.114
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.949
She may have survived
the EMP once,

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.284
but this close to the tower?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.152
Look, if we don't
stop that pulse,

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.945
even if you get to her first...

01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:49.847
Jake!

01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:52.549
If that update goes out,

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:54.885
she's dead anyway.

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:01.992
Fuck!

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.547
Are we getting close?

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:15.548
What?

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.606
I was following you.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.753
Yeah.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.011
We're close.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.581
Hey, that's mine.

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:33.423
It's this way.

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.311
Spot 16.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.990
Inter-transmission code.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:59.649
Codes entered.
Generator is coming online.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.298
You should be proud.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.600
Your work here
is gonna save mankind.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.202
Hold code accepted.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.161
Twelve minutes till transmit.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.342
If he's alive, where is he?

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.578
Harris said that
he escaped from the camp.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:19.579
No one has seen him.

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:20.646
We have to find him.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.882
Yeah, we do.

01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:24.350
I'm going to see how
the Whippett is faring,

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:26.920
perhaps you can find something
out from the prisoner.

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:28.478
You're... You're not staying?

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.281
You got this.

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:37.287
Yes, I do.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.541
You've been here before, right?

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.034
You recognize anything?

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.279
According to Clare's map,

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.681
the elevator to the tower
is this way.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:57.884
Molly.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:59.409
No, we can't.
We don't have time.

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.447
Jake! No!

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.253
Jake, if the pulse goes off...

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.488
Damn it!

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:29.749
Stop it!

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.175
Stop doing that!

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:35.679
Please. Please.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:40.650
She's the only child to survive.
We need to know why.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:44.188
If there's a glitch
in the software...

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.056
Dr. Conners,
there is a call for you.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.707
It's me.
He's gone.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.509
Who's gone?

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:34.271
The anomaly came and
broke the prisoner free.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.518
Guards!
Take your men to the cells.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:42.788
Do whatever you have to but
do not let them get in here.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.114
Go!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.119
Time to change the world.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:03.944
Is she okay?

01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:05.011
She's still alive.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.379
Okay. Come on.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.304
Come on.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.436
No, no, you don't underst...

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.740
I can't stop it.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.276
Sequence is initiated.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:48.955
Ah! Come on!

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:50.156
There's no override.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.824
What about the bombs?

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.026
I destroyed the remote.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.818
Don't worry about them.
Just do your jobs!

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.563
Stop!

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:59.123
I think we can
detonate it manually.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.002
Uh...

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:03.703
Freeze!

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:04.637
Detonate it manually?

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.339
Yeah. Yeah.
From the transmitter.

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:08.941
Let the guards do their jobs.
You do yours!

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.911
But it's on the roof. We can't
get to there from here.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:15.839
Through there.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.852
I'm not sure I can fit.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:20.744
Not you.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:25.282
Station 143,
quickly. Paulson down.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.832
You had that the whole time?

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.591
It's Clare's, right?
I think it's fine.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:40.273
Okay, we're only gonna get
one shot at this.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.242
But it's gonna be
the full charge.

01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:43.633
This much power...

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.446
could kill her.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.339
90 seconds, and
she's dead anyway, right?

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:06.523
Come on, Jake.
Come on.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:12.805
I love you so much, Bug.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:13.863
More than anything.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:45.838
Come on, baby.

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:46.896
Come on, Bug.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.299
Be back.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:03.547
You're getting sad all over me.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:10.520
Did you catch me?

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.339
Oh, God.

01:08:19.363 --> 01:08:20.906
Where is the pirate?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.299
Where are we?

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:30.350
Look here, okay?
Something's happened, okay?

01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:32.484
You listen to me
really carefully.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:33.586
Okay.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.854
This is...

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:35.921
This is MadCap.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:36.912
Hi.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.192
Hi.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:40.760
He's gonna tell you what to do.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.196
It's really important that
we do it really quickly, okay?

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.287
Okay.

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:49.669
You gotta try to find the
little red box on the wall

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:50.870
Okay.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:53.139
Remember when you unlocked
that roller door for me?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.029
Duh.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:04.149
You know, a fully-grown man can fit
through a hole the size of a golf ball.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:09.488
That's... uh. Yeah, just through
the hole ahead that way,

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:14.827
and, uh, and you'll see
a small flashing blue light.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.961
I see it.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:19.999
Okay. Now, turn the key
from "Remote" to "Local," okay?

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:21.267
And press the button.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.702
I can't really read.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.870
Okay. Just turn the
key and press the button.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:25.970
It's stuck!

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.139
It's just tight!

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.598
It is just tight.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:30.567
Jake?

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.104
Marion?

01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:59.905
Oh, God, no.

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:01.565
What have you done?

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.502
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
You know her?

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.539
Great job, Bug.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:20.393
Okay, we gotta get out of here.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.951
This whole tower's
gonna crumble.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.790
Marion, is there
another way out?

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:28.725
Like a secret way?

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:33.897
Marion.

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:05.995
The power's out.
The elevator won't work.

01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:12.011
Come on, you gonna
give me a hand or what?

01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:21.611
Molly, you see through there?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.849
There's strings.

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:30.563
We gotta go.

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:31.997
Climb out through the cage...

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.457
Molly, get back here!

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.028
Now. You.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:40.740
Huh.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.065
No, no, no, no.
I can't crawl in there.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:43.809
Climb out.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.478
Go, now!

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:47.580
Oh, no, no, no.
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.482
Get on your back, okay?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.240
Just lie down till
the cage moves.

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:53.477
You gotta hurry.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:00.817
Jesus.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.862
Ah, I can't!

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:05.598
You go, man.
You gotta go, now!

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:06.790
Tell me to move.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:10.202
Just tell me what to do.

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.837
Put your legs over the rails.

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:14.340
We can't stay here.
We gotta go.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.035
Molly, can you get me the...

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:24.608
Okay.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:29.879
Hold tight, okay?

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.607
The tower's falling.

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:50.233
If we can get down from
that mountain right now.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.873
I need to reach that cable.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.844
I need you to wriggle
round on to my back, okay?

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.655
I don't wanna.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.180
Be brave for me.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:05.982
Come on.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.329
Grab me around my neck.
Grab my neck, I got you.

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:15.267
Come on.
You can do it.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.269
Not that side.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.538
Let's get up there.
Ready?

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:19.763
Hold on.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:40.717
Just slide down.
Come on, keep going.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.687
Bug?

01:14:18.522 --> 01:14:19.699
You okay?

01:14:19.723 --> 01:14:21.190
I hurt my knee.

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:37.249
You!

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:38.383
Up against the wall.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:39.643
My foot's caught.

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:44.456
I can't!

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.558
Jake.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.426
Tell him to put the gun down.

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.862
Just tell him to put the gun down.
He'll listen to you.

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:56.301
Tell The General I got the
anomaly and the girl.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.794
They were with Dr. Conners.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:00.129
Jake, tell him.

01:15:00.564 --> 01:15:01.665
Wait.

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:04.276
Please.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.111
No, no! Like you mean it.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.079
Like a demand.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:08.905
Put it down now!

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:15.178
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and tell him
to put his hands up in the air.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:18.682
Put your arms up in the air.

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:37.209
I don't understand.

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:41.614
How... You shouldn't be able
to strike the security team.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:45.718
Electricity shorts the virus
and it can't read my mind.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:47.944
Didn't see
that one coming, did you?

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.349
Get out of the way, kid.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.984
No!

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:59.364
It's okay.
It's okay, Molly.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.224
You can let him live, okay?

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:06.405
Okay, I'm just gonna
free his legs.

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:08.007
Your daddy and I are friends.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.498
I wouldn't go all that far.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.586
MadCap, no!

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.589
She's the one
who made the virus.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:25.290
She's the one, Jake.

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.959
She tortured me,

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.160
she gave me the update.

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:29.252
She's gotta die.

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.263
She's gotta die.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:32.564
She gave me the update.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:33.857
She's my wife.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:37.293
She's my wife.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.873
Hi, baby.

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:56.880
You're so beautiful.

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:01.484
I thought that you...

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.924
When the hospital was hit, I...

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.160
He told me you were killed.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.897
And when the pulse went off...

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:18.034
Dad said you were tall.

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:24.140
Did he now?

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:00.877
Okay, we gotta go.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:03.179
We gotta go.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:02.906
Come on. Come on.

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.347
Over here.

01:19:13.016 --> 01:19:16.252
Okay, you guys go first.
Go, go, go. Go, go.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.707
Come on, hurry up. Let's go.

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:42.078
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:43.947
There could be guards.

01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:48.051
Yeah, there's guards.

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:54.299
I'm not gonna stand here
and get shot at, okay?

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.634
So you cover us, we're going.

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:57.660
Okay. Okay. Go, go, go!

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:16.612
Just a second.

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:41.704
In here.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.419
Lock the door.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.521
Okay, we go left,
get back to the camp.

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:50.990
Which one?
Uh...

01:20:51.014 --> 01:20:53.082
Just up here, right where
the drains go through.

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:55.594
What did you say?

01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.762
Uh, we go left to
get back to the camp.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:58.864
No, no, no, no. After that.

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:01.557
Uh, right where
the drains go through.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.404
Right where
the drains go through.

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:12.401
What's in here?

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.340
I don't know. Secrets.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.785
Maybe you should ask your wife.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:24.613
We've been trying to get in but
can't complete the code. So...

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:26.615
312...

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:28.327
What?

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:29.661
There's something Clare said.

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:32.564
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Clare?

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:36.359
She said "312, right where
the drains go through."

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:39.838
3... 3...

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:41.173
She meant "turn," right?

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:42.641
I don't know.
She kept repeating.

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:45.068
"312, right where
the drains go through."

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:46.878
312...

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.104
Come on, 312...

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.052
312...

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:24.207
Oh, my God.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:29.321
Did you know about this?

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:30.922
Of course she did.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.557
I knew they're up to something.

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:35.684
Jake, I swear we were only
told what we needed to know.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.034
These weapons are like
nothing I've ever seen before.

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:44.460
Uh, well, actually...

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:46.972
Are these upgrades
for the guards?

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:49.698
That's too many for...
Too many for just guards.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.079
Enough for an army. For everyone,
so we can fight their war.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:56.481
War? Fighting against who?

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:57.916
I don't know.
Does it matter?

01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.818
I don't know. Maybe they wanna
retake cities of the north.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:01.020
Maybe other camps.

01:23:01.044 --> 01:23:03.722
You know, this is what this
whole camp was designed for.

01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:05.157
No, we were trying to help.

01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:07.426
Oh, yeah, to help?
What, build armies?

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.285
Send people to their deaths?

01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:14.066
That's why there's no newborns.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:15.758
'Cause it'd be a liability.

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.229
These don't work anyway.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.543
Molly, come here.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:26.635
If he's planning to go to war...

01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.736
Molly, get away from him.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:35.671
Come here.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:38.974
What's wrong with them?

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.521
They're looped.

01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:44.123
Wait, wait.
What do you mean "looped"?

01:24:44.147 --> 01:24:48.293
They're stuck searching for a signal.
Without a carrier signal,

01:24:48.317 --> 01:24:50.695
they're paralyzed.

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:53.332
They're paralyzed?
They can still breathe.

01:24:53.356 --> 01:24:54.899
Their tongue's
functions are fine.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:58.237
You see what she did?
You see what this virus is?

01:24:58.261 --> 01:25:01.273
She's paralyzed
an entire population.

01:25:01.297 --> 01:25:02.807
You did this.

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.443
You did this.

01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:06.445
Actually, you did this.

01:25:06.469 --> 01:25:09.714
When you blew up
the tower, you did this.

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:11.583
You were about to
release an update

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:13.485
that was gonna steal
everyone's thoughts.

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:15.478
I was about to release a cure.

01:25:18.381 --> 01:25:19.882
What about the guards?

01:25:21.684 --> 01:25:24.896
Well, staff like me
are on a different version.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.956
It's self-contained with
no violence inhibitor, but...

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:31.794
it's permanent.

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:33.862
And the update,

01:25:35.398 --> 01:25:36.508
is that permanent?

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:38.801
That's why I had to act now.

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:42.481
The virus wouldn't have
worked after the update.

01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:44.949
But how could you even
create something

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.286
that's just gonna rob people
of their own free will?

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:48.644
I did it for her.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.490
Her dad was dead and

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:54.350
if I could stop the violence
and keep her safe...

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:57.829
But, then, the pulse happened.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:25:59.322
Killed all the children.

01:26:02.225 --> 01:26:03.559
All but her.

01:26:05.528 --> 01:26:07.463
She shares her DNA.

01:26:10.065 --> 01:26:11.467
It saved her life.

01:26:12.134 --> 01:26:13.278
We gotta go.

01:26:13.302 --> 01:26:14.579
Like... like, now.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.891
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:28.159
I'm sorry.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.261
I couldn't help it.

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:30.895
I thought about
the Resistance Camp,

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:33.898
and whether they're
frozen like this too.

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.300
We...

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.059
we've kept this
secret for years.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.662
I've just shown them the way.

01:26:40.763 --> 01:26:42.541
We'll be slaughtered, Jake.

01:26:42.565 --> 01:26:44.600
Then we better get there first.

01:26:52.074 --> 01:26:53.184
Hey.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.377
She's nice.

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:25.508
Stay down.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.720
We need to find cover.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.413
Right there, right there.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.688
Hope we need that weapon.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.527
Hold on.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:53.698
I'm holding steady.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.691
I'm a better shot
than you, remember?

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.702
I don't suppose
you packed any extra ammo.

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:32.220
Hold on.

01:31:53.909 --> 01:31:56.078
Good thing you stole
the fastest car.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:00.148
Uh, looks like
they got one, too.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:03.185
No, no, they only got...

01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:08.724
Oh, no. What?

01:32:11.594 --> 01:32:14.272
Oh, you gotta be
playing with my balls.

01:32:31.013 --> 01:32:32.715
He's headed towards
the mountains.

01:32:34.449 --> 01:32:37.152
Right there. He's going towards
the tunnels. Follow him.

01:32:58.206 --> 01:32:59.141
Up here.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:01.109
Hurry. Hurry.

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:10.762
Got the camps just through here.
It won't take long.

01:33:10.786 --> 01:33:13.632
Just over the next hill.
Ten minutes tops.

01:33:13.656 --> 01:33:15.333
Ow.

01:33:15.357 --> 01:33:17.702
See, most people think that diamonds
come from coal. They don't...

01:33:17.726 --> 01:33:19.570
Do you ever shut up?

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.506
Hey, you said "About 15
minutes" about an hour ago.

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.275
Yep, not far.

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:27.011
See, the pulse killed
everything, except the flies.

01:33:27.035 --> 01:33:29.447
Get the...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up.

01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:30.915
I swear I just saw a snake.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:32.216
Well, that's perfect then.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.217
Come on.

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:34.977
Well, here it is.

01:33:36.078 --> 01:33:37.588
I can't see anything.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.982
If you could see it, your friends
would have already wiped it out.

01:33:43.018 --> 01:33:44.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33:44.887 --> 01:33:46.221
Are you crazy?

01:33:46.789 --> 01:33:47.990
Well, I'm not.

01:33:49.257 --> 01:33:50.558
You're out of your mind.

01:33:51.026 --> 01:33:51.894
Maybe.

01:34:00.869 --> 01:34:03.214
There's a tunnel that leads
you out from the bottom to the hole

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:05.016
into a series of trenches
that we carved.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.617
And that will take us
around the camp.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.219
The passageway
is mostly crammed.

01:34:08.243 --> 01:34:10.822
Funny word "crammed".
It comes from the Latin word...

01:34:10.846 --> 01:34:13.224
So, uh, the kid. Is she...

01:34:13.248 --> 01:34:15.660
It's mostly quartz, feldspar...

01:34:21.857 --> 01:34:23.025
It's okay, Jim.

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:25.894
We're gonna get you out of this.

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:29.431
Don't they starve?

01:34:49.752 --> 01:34:51.119
How do we unfreeze them?

01:34:55.891 --> 01:34:57.025
Clare.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:58.436
Madison?

01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.771
They're, uh,

01:34:59.795 --> 01:35:00.929
they're with me.

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.307
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:05.143
Clare. Clare.

01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:07.178
Clare, it's okay now. I'm here.

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:10.114
I... I'm sorry, I...

01:35:10.138 --> 01:35:12.851
I tried resisting
as long as I could, but...

01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:15.510
I know. I hope they're better.

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.158
It's done something to my head.

01:35:20.182 --> 01:35:22.293
I can't see out my left eye.

01:35:22.317 --> 01:35:24.920
Resisting can cause
hemorrhaging.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.657
Why is she here?

01:35:31.026 --> 01:35:33.061
Uh, it's a long story.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:34.396
Um.

01:35:35.697 --> 01:35:37.041
Can you walk?

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.943
Easier with my zapper.

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:40.511
Uh, yeah, I know.

01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:41.679
Um, it's gone.

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:43.181
We...

01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:47.009
We had to kill the virus
to wake up the girl.

01:35:52.214 --> 01:35:53.148
So...

01:35:53.816 --> 01:35:55.183
So, there is hope.

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:57.152
Yeah.

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:09.440
You got any weapons here?

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:10.574
We need to leave.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:11.542
And go where?

01:36:11.566 --> 01:36:14.378
This is the only place
with food supplies.

01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:16.104
Look, there are a couple
of guns in the armory.

01:36:16.872 --> 01:36:18.116
But not very many.

01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:21.543
They've beat us here.
They're slaughtering.

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:24.122
Armory.

01:36:24.146 --> 01:36:25.380
Just up there.

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:05.596
Molly.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.621
Molly!

01:37:11.927 --> 01:37:14.038
No! No! No!

01:37:14.062 --> 01:37:15.940
No.

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:24.782
It's all right.

01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:27.275
Shh. It's all right.

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:28.686
It's okay.

01:37:30.645 --> 01:37:31.856
Dad.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.681
I... I saved her.

01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:35.483
Yeah, you did.

01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:37.252
Yeah.

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:47.262
No.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:37:59.741
Enough.

01:38:09.651 --> 01:38:10.718
No!

01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:24.842
No. No!

01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:25.767
No.

01:38:28.003 --> 01:38:30.581
You! You killed her!

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:31.506
That's enough.

01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:33.708
Master Crane?

01:38:34.977 --> 01:38:36.311
You killed her.

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:45.653
I'm sorry.

01:38:46.888 --> 01:38:50.525
My guards acted in self defense.
I am truly sorry.

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:54.762
Your loss is regrettable.

01:39:00.702 --> 01:39:02.680
Good to see you, Jake.

01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:05.340
I don't understand,
Master Crane. I...

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:08.419
I thought you were...

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.221
I thought you were dead, too.

01:39:10.245 --> 01:39:13.224
But, fortunately, we were
both wrong, huh?

01:39:13.248 --> 01:39:14.882
How could you be part of this?

01:39:16.985 --> 01:39:18.862
Slaughtering all these people?

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:20.331
Slaughtering? No.

01:39:20.355 --> 01:39:23.201
We didn't... There's no slaughter.
We saved these people.

01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:24.935
You tried to kill me.

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:26.070
Wait.

01:39:26.094 --> 01:39:27.305
You tried to kill Molly.

01:39:27.329 --> 01:39:28.772
You know him, too?

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.976
No one tried to kill Molly.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.446
When I heard that there was a
man who could not be governed,

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:38.882
carrying a living child,
I thought...

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:42.486
I had to know. I had to know if
there were any other like you.

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:45.547
Others who were not
responding to the software.

01:39:46.381 --> 01:39:48.316
For the sake of humanity, Jake.

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:49.727
What's humanity?

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:51.686
You stole our humanity!
Would you please?

01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:54.999
They said that
you promised peace.

01:39:55.023 --> 01:39:57.135
Rebuilding society,
immunization...

01:39:57.159 --> 01:40:00.371
And did we not deliver
upon that? Did we not stop

01:40:00.395 --> 01:40:02.240
the slaughter of the weak?

01:40:02.264 --> 01:40:04.742
Did we not make
the world a safer place?

01:40:04.766 --> 01:40:07.235
No, you did not.

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.513
We did not.

01:40:09.537 --> 01:40:12.583
I thought we were doing
something noble.

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:15.586
You speak of peace
and prepare for war.

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:17.721
You're manufacturing weapons?

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.457
You're so noble.

01:40:19.481 --> 01:40:21.883
Dragging these people
to their death.

01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:25.863
Fuck your war.

01:40:25.887 --> 01:40:26.997
My war?

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:30.825
This is every bit as much
your war as it is mine.

01:40:32.194 --> 01:40:33.761
This is mankind's war.

01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:36.798
Let me show you something.

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:38.933
Bring it in.

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:53.257
This, my friends,
is what is coming.

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:56.518
This is what Mr. Capper
refers to as "my war."

01:41:02.157 --> 01:41:04.068
So, that creature did all this?

01:41:04.092 --> 01:41:05.169
What is that?

01:41:05.193 --> 01:41:08.372
It is something else.

01:41:08.396 --> 01:41:12.042
This is what bacteria and radiation
did to the survivors in the north.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:15.546
Radiation didn't find its way
this far south, bacteria did.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:19.317
Bacteria alone killed people.
They were the lucky ones.

01:41:19.341 --> 01:41:22.553
Combined with radiation,
you get this.

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:26.023
There is a hoard of these
about a week away from here.

01:41:26.047 --> 01:41:28.426
This is one of the many scouts
they have been sending.

01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:31.562
And you are damn right
I am manufacturing weapons.

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:33.321
If this was the whole point,

01:41:34.222 --> 01:41:35.490
why not tell everyone?

01:41:36.158 --> 01:41:37.492
'Cause they would run.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.738
Yeah, some would
fight, sure, but...

01:41:40.762 --> 01:41:44.242
unless we override fear,
override mass hysteria,

01:41:44.266 --> 01:41:47.545
we are gonna be
as dead as our friend.

01:41:59.414 --> 01:42:00.782
They are formidable.

01:42:01.516 --> 01:42:02.860
And they are hard to kill.

01:42:02.884 --> 01:42:05.263
But you can't make
people fight these things.

01:42:05.287 --> 01:42:06.530
Yeah, but they would fight.

01:42:06.554 --> 01:42:08.899
I mean, if they had the choice.

01:42:08.923 --> 01:42:09.991
Would you fight?

01:42:10.892 --> 01:42:12.303
Mr. Capper.

01:42:12.327 --> 01:42:13.895
You're damn right I would.

01:42:21.436 --> 01:42:23.371
And if you chose to fight...

01:42:24.138 --> 01:42:27.785
if you all chose to fight,

01:42:27.809 --> 01:42:29.344
how long would you last?

01:42:29.744 --> 01:42:31.655
You farmers.

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:36.951
You teachers. You florists.
You are not soldiers.

01:42:38.286 --> 01:42:39.421
The update

01:42:41.623 --> 01:42:44.768
does more than
let me read your minds.

01:42:44.792 --> 01:42:47.028
It... well, observe.

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:00.342
What the hell are you doing?

01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:10.918
Your ideas,

01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:12.896
they're flawed, Jake.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.122
I'm sorry, man.
It's not me, it's the...

01:43:18.226 --> 01:43:19.837
Oh, whoa, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:21.429
Free will hesitates.

01:43:29.003 --> 01:43:31.906
Free will has regrets.
It makes mistakes.

01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:37.521
Free will falters.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:40.014
It grows weary.
It becomes weak.

01:43:55.196 --> 01:43:56.840
Free will lacks conviction.

01:43:56.864 --> 01:43:59.977
You must understand this, Jake.
This is your most important lesson.

01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:00.968
I'm sorry, man.

01:44:03.037 --> 01:44:06.216
Even if they have the will,
they do not have the skill.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.174
Are you okay?

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:09.086
Am I okay?

01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:11.489
Even if they wanna fight,
they don't have the...

01:44:11.513 --> 01:44:12.647
Might.

01:44:16.017 --> 01:44:16.994
The ability.

01:44:17.018 --> 01:44:18.796
I can't stop, Jake.

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:19.663
All right.

01:44:19.687 --> 01:44:21.088
Let me help you with that.

01:44:32.233 --> 01:44:35.503
The update gives them
that ability.

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.776
Nod if you follow me.

01:44:43.878 --> 01:44:44.988
Correction,

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:47.849
don't fucking move
if you follow me.

01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:51.185
Thanks to your little stunt,

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.565
you gave me
an army of mannequins.

01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:56.233
I thought it would free them.

01:44:56.257 --> 01:44:58.101
Never fear, Mr. Capper,

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.337
there is still a way.

01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:00.404
You know there is.

01:45:00.428 --> 01:45:02.730
How?
The tower's gone.

01:45:07.569 --> 01:45:08.670
What are you doing?

01:45:14.075 --> 01:45:15.686
Marion Conners,

01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:17.321
you have betrayed the order.

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:20.648
You know the penalty.

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:22.826
Jake.

01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:25.829
Ready?
Hey, what are you doing?

01:45:25.853 --> 01:45:28.122
Baby, I will always love you.

01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:29.624
Aim.

01:45:33.227 --> 01:45:34.304
Thank you.

01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:35.639
Jake.

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:37.932
And fire.
No!

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:46.216
I am so sorry, buddy.
I had to be sure.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.685
That you could kill my family?

01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:49.420
No, that you could stop me,

01:45:49.444 --> 01:45:52.856
and, man, but go ahead, you tell 'em.
You're the one who discovered.

01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.726
I just... saw it
on a little scream.

01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:56.718
What?

01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:01.164
Okay, okay, okay.

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.790
Okay. Okay.

01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:04.568
Jake has the virus.

01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:06.169
But you told me
that I was immune.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.738
Yeah, but I was wrong.

01:46:07.762 --> 01:46:09.130
You weren't controlled.

01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:11.475
In the cave I felt it.

01:46:11.499 --> 01:46:12.643
You told me to keep Molly safe,

01:46:12.667 --> 01:46:14.111
and I had no choice.

01:46:14.135 --> 01:46:15.979
When that animal
was gonna cut me in half,

01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:18.940
I... see, that's why
they listened to you.

01:46:20.842 --> 01:46:23.120
Jake, you have the virus.

01:46:23.144 --> 01:46:24.546
But unlike the rest of us,

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.224
you can broadcast.

01:46:27.248 --> 01:46:28.182
And there we have it.

01:46:29.150 --> 01:46:32.062
You are the tower, Jake.

01:46:32.086 --> 01:46:35.332
You were able to broadcast
the update. And you alone

01:46:35.356 --> 01:46:36.333
can save us.

01:46:36.357 --> 01:46:38.235
Oh, so this is a test?

01:46:38.259 --> 01:46:40.027
You wanna fucking test me?

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.098
Let 'em go.

01:46:44.632 --> 01:46:45.933
Step forward.

01:46:48.570 --> 01:46:50.071
Kick each other in the nuts.

01:46:57.912 --> 01:46:58.846
Run!

01:47:00.181 --> 01:47:00.958
Run!

01:47:00.982 --> 01:47:03.150
Run until your lights give away.

01:47:04.519 --> 01:47:05.563
Jake,

01:47:05.587 --> 01:47:07.531
you're no virus.
You can free them.

01:47:07.555 --> 01:47:09.591
This, Marion,

01:47:11.058 --> 01:47:13.027
after all the work
we've done together?

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:18.141
No!

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:21.368
That was the last strand
of uninfected DNA.

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.582
This device

01:47:24.606 --> 01:47:26.974
will amplify your reach
to that of the tower.

01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:30.377
Careful, it will sting.

01:47:38.119 --> 01:47:40.564
Well, come on, you see these people, Jake.
They're trapped.

01:47:40.588 --> 01:47:42.966
You gotta free 'em. There's
no choice here. Come on.

01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:45.335
You taught me
the value of control, Crane.

01:47:45.359 --> 01:47:46.637
I understand the need.

01:47:46.661 --> 01:47:49.773
The update can save
these people.

01:47:49.797 --> 01:47:52.166
You say free will
lacks conviction.

01:47:52.734 --> 01:47:54.244
It falters.

01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:55.713
It has regrets.

01:47:55.737 --> 01:47:57.404
Grows weary and tired.

01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:01.943
What I've learned
from these people

01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:03.821
is my greatest lesson.

01:48:03.845 --> 01:48:05.146
'Cause no matter what,

01:48:07.348 --> 01:48:09.927
you always have a choice.

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:14.221
You're wrong, Marion.

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:18.135
There is still uninfected DNA.

01:48:18.159 --> 01:48:19.360
Trust me, Bug. Come.

01:48:21.462 --> 01:48:22.429
No!

01:48:23.565 --> 01:48:24.866
Ow!

01:48:56.698 --> 01:48:58.332
The other hoard is coming,

01:48:59.667 --> 01:49:02.069
and we stand and
face them together.

01:49:06.774 --> 01:49:08.819
Many fled.

01:49:08.843 --> 01:49:11.178
Many more chose
to stay and fight.

01:49:18.219 --> 01:49:20.731
There are other camps
further south.

01:49:20.755 --> 01:49:23.290
But we are their
last line of defense.

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.896
And we choose to fight.

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:05.368
Oh, MadCap?

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:07.304
