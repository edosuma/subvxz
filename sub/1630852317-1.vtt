WEBVTT

00:34.284 --> 00:37.921
Vodka, without ice. My name is Collette.

00:38.627 --> 00:40.989
Is a French name?

00:41.022 --> 00:44.756
Go, you yes you know. Of Paris.

00:46.099 --> 00:48.581
I Am Lloyd. Of Presno.

00:49.004 --> 00:50.888
I like in knowing you, Lloyd.

00:51.271 --> 00:53.851
Collette, a beautiful name
for a pretty young lady.

00:54.912 --> 00:58.678
- Miss, not?
- It picks up your things, Lloyd.

00:59.223 --> 01:02.380
I am available. You only have to pay.

01:04.043 --> 01:06.112
Not while I am here.

01:06.438 --> 01:09.116
It excuses, I am speaking
with the gentleman.

01:11.228 --> 01:14.733
- I don't find a gentleman.
- What do you want?

01:16.752 --> 01:18.604
I want to take you to house.

01:27.481 --> 01:28.853
This place is fantastic.

01:36.294 --> 01:38.591
Take off the clothes. I want to see you.

01:51.558 --> 01:53.245
Everything.

02:23.935 --> 02:29.324
This goes against my rules.

02:34.856 --> 02:36.478
Do you have the clean hands?

02:38.336 --> 02:41.014
- How do you say?
- Wash you them, please.

02:42.679 --> 02:44.268
With soap.

02:47.628 --> 02:48.999
It is in the shower.

03:00.496 --> 03:03.555
THIRSTY OF IT BLEEDS

03:19.081 --> 03:20.387
You made it well.

03:20.804 --> 03:22.393
Tell me where Bishop is, and I leave.

03:22.975 --> 03:24.217
In due course of time.

03:24.636 --> 03:29.328
Perhaps I didn't express myself well. Where is it?

03:33.704 --> 03:38.429
1653. Do you know how to drive?
There you will find Bishop.

03:38.622 --> 03:40.179
Now, veto.

03:42.166 --> 03:45.542
Sr. Harrison. We see each other in the hell.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.875
My God!

03:51.842 --> 03:53.267
Now you release yourself of here.
And you won't tell to anybody

03:53.566 --> 03:55.090
what you dressed. Because
if you make it, I will know it

03:55.385 --> 03:57.008
and I will go behind you.

03:58.323 --> 04:00.555
And do look for you a decent work, yes?

04:04.964 --> 04:07.642
- Thank you.
- I told you that you left.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.903
6 months ago

04:48.200 --> 04:49.571
Everything will be well.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.831
I swear that I won't take water.

04:54.266 --> 04:55.986
It is a joke.

04:56.374 --> 04:58.922
OK, I have a call in the
another line. I have to hang.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.609
I also love you. Good-bye.

05:02.121 --> 05:03.363
I sit down it. He/she was speaking with my mother.

05:05.921 --> 05:09.209
Yes. OK. We see each other tonight.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.795
OK.

05:13.201 --> 05:15.880
Yes, I also love you. Good-bye.

05:18.757 --> 05:21.054
Hello. Did you want to see me?

05:21.376 --> 05:22.966
What it is it that always
do you request and do you never have?

05:23.930 --> 05:25.552
A boyfriend that knows how to cook?

05:25.846 --> 05:29.613
- You have the cover.
- My God!

05:30.093 --> 05:33.054
- I am very proud of you.
- I cannot believe it.

05:33.445 --> 05:34.817
I tell you that an am
not very afraid with your

05:35.170 --> 05:36.792
infiltramientos in these
awful shows.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.382
Neither that you say it. This me
it put the hen skin.

05:39.768 --> 05:40.943
Do we take place tonight?

05:41.301 --> 05:42.727
Not I can. Tonight I will take
to my mother and my sister

05:43.025 --> 05:44.167
to have dinner.

05:44.462 --> 05:46.400
Your family is interfering
too much in your social life.

05:47.623 --> 05:49.146
- What do you want?
- Is Sadie there?

05:49.283 --> 05:51.547
I have to teach him/her something.

05:52.541 --> 05:55.404
You remember to the shy girl
that he/she didn't allow to interview?

05:56.532 --> 05:59.112
Yes, the cousin Tricia. I called
to the number that gave me...

05:59.406 --> 06:01.126
But it was not a number
of telephone, truth?

06:01.449 --> 06:03.354
- I supposed that he/she had deceived me.
- Yes, he/she would make sense.

06:03.716 --> 06:05.719
But I looked well at the number
and I took it to a mark

06:06.015 --> 06:07.833
in a book. So
I got the book and I settled down

06:08.155 --> 06:10.800
a heap of strange bonds and I obtained

06:11.029 --> 06:14.665
countersigns. Most
without importance, but...

06:15.020 --> 06:16.261
Ethan, I don't want to be weighed,
but the track lost you

06:16.585 --> 06:17.923
in that of the book.

06:19.363 --> 06:21.246
, THE ROAD THIS IN YOUR
BLEED YOU HAVE TO BE HE ALONE

06:21.534 --> 06:22.960
, THE WRITING THIS IN YOUR
ALMA ADVANCES IN THE DARKNESS

06:23.258 --> 06:24.401
THE BANQUET BEGINS TONIGHT

06:24.695 --> 06:25.642
That everything is?

06:25.940 --> 06:28.651
Three hours that I could have
past seeing pornography

06:28.942 --> 06:33.340
Brazilian or it fights. But me
I gave bill that the pages

06:33.636 --> 06:36.118
they hide a map of
images reveal.

06:36.541 --> 06:38.512
That it takes to where?

06:39.288 --> 06:41.008
Araphoe #987
- An address.

06:41.331 --> 06:43.693
And it stops your luck, I have an appointment

06:44.078 --> 06:47.747
with a vixen. Perhaps
know to a very pretty one.

06:48.005 --> 06:49.724
Ethan, the report is already complete.

06:50.048 --> 06:51.866
My smaller sister you
it graduates of the secondary.

06:52.123 --> 06:55.085
And I will take it to Mexico to
to take sun and Daisies.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.101
We go.

06:58.383 --> 07:00.167
Not curiosity?

07:01.703 --> 07:03.804
A little. But there is not
anything that he/she can make.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.633
I already finished.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.609
- Not I plan to enter.
- Not be cowardly.

07:20.893 --> 07:21.623
Everything will be well.

07:21.916 --> 07:24.495
Sealed windows, any
car. For sure it is here?

07:24.758 --> 07:27.598
Your father would not die if
did he/she know that their girl is here?

07:28.174 --> 07:29.894
Busy demasiad is
,to think of my.

07:29.994 --> 07:31.997
We will have a good time.

07:33.762 --> 07:37.017
- I don't believe it.
- Seriously?

07:37.562 --> 07:40.239
Always faces the same thing.
We enter to greet.

07:40.532 --> 07:42.055
We are half
hour. And then we leave.

07:43.979 --> 07:45.634
I will call to a taxi,
and I will leave home.

07:45.928 --> 07:47.266
Where will you find a taxi here?

07:47.556 --> 07:49.340
Then, I will be seated in the car.

07:49.759 --> 07:53.014
You are a chiquilla.
This will be the last time

07:53.303 --> 07:55.470
that it goes out with you. Give me ten minutes.

07:55.763 --> 07:58.245
- Tуmate your time.
- Well. That they are 15.

08:17.699 --> 08:18.940
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.406
- Kaitlin, not?
- Yes.

08:20.669 --> 08:22.127
- Ahead.
- Thank you to invite me.

08:22.424 --> 08:23.600
- Divine Luz.
- You also.

08:30.504 --> 08:33.628
Did I arrive very early?
Where are all?

08:34.398 --> 08:37.969
Below. That you have a good time.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.225
Hello?

10:02.816 --> 10:04.155
Kaitlin?

11:20.216 --> 11:21.457
Kaitlin?

11:24.432 --> 11:25.542
Hello?

12:40.491 --> 12:42.591
Dad, answers.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.543
Answer!

12:54.764 --> 12:55.809
Dad.

13:02.332 --> 13:05.587
He/she leaves your name and number. I will call you.

14:04.438 --> 14:05.580
Outside of my road!

14:06.290 --> 14:08.619
- I speak seriously.
- Outside of my road!

14:09.674 --> 14:10.687
Outside of my road!

14:12.133 --> 14:14.942
Jesъs! iNo tells me
that it is her, damned it is!

14:15.581 --> 14:18.771
Tricia! Jesъs!

14:27.268 --> 14:28.411
He/she hears.

14:32.189 --> 14:35.052
Not it is the red area of
Tijuana, but he/she looks at this.

14:35.734 --> 14:37.454
This is not the girl that you interviewed?

14:47.197 --> 14:49.776
He/she said that he/she went to a party, a banquet,

14:50.071 --> 14:51.496
,but I thought that it was a joke.

14:52.753 --> 14:55.910
- Ethan this already saw?
- Not he/she came today.

14:57.383 --> 14:59.103
Neither neither on Friday.

15:21.075 --> 15:22.415
Hello?

15:29.697 --> 15:31.286
Hello?

17:07.534 --> 17:08.676
Ethan?

17:40.007 --> 17:41.532
Ethan?

17:45.309 --> 17:46.516
Hello?

17:47.416 --> 17:50.573
Not I wanted to get scared. I am friend of Ethan.

17:51.534 --> 17:54.844
Hello. I came to bring their correspondence.

17:59.006 --> 18:03.504
- Very kind.
- I believe that I leave.

18:04.307 --> 18:05.897
Linda wallet.

18:10.119 --> 18:12.024
Are you looking for your spray of pepper?

18:15.131 --> 18:17.777
Not it is a very friendly expression.

18:18.070 --> 18:20.585
- Do I have violator's face?
- No. Me only...

18:21.359 --> 18:25.474
- He/she looks...
- Not I will look.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.355
He/she stops to say that.

18:27.649 --> 18:31.602
- Sadie Blake.
- What do you want?

18:33.013 --> 18:34.471
I want to take you to go for a walk.

18:35.121 --> 18:36.067
I not even know you.

18:36.877 --> 18:38.564
We can make that this is easy.

18:39.847 --> 18:41.338
But it would not be amusing.

19:27.519 --> 19:29.337
Sadie Blake in meat and bone.

19:30.713 --> 19:32.618
I loved your report.

19:33.011 --> 19:35.972
You describe the plates very well.

19:36.269 --> 19:40.003
And that of the cocktails of
bleed it was fantastic.

19:40.548 --> 19:42.485
You are more beautiful of that than I imagined.

19:42.846 --> 19:44.784
- What do I make here?
- You will respond questions.

19:45.081 --> 19:46.289
I don't know anything!

19:47.348 --> 19:48.295
OK.

20:02.420 --> 20:05.479
- What is that?
- It takes a look.

20:37.512 --> 20:40.669
He/she sits down again, calm down
and tell me what you know.

20:40.961 --> 20:42.267
I don't know anything!

20:49.071 --> 20:52.577
You know what I am. What we are.

20:52.870 --> 20:53.796
My God!

20:57.086 --> 21:00.113
I am here God.

21:00.407 --> 21:04.522
So obey me and tell me
what Tricia told you.

21:05.708 --> 21:08.189
He/she didn't tell me anything!

21:09.508 --> 21:14.386
Ethan found a place and he told it to me.

21:15.159 --> 21:17.162
- I swear him!
- Don't run off with the voice.

21:26.175 --> 21:27.699
You are a valiant girl.

21:29.847 --> 21:33.832
You know, I take a lot of time in this.

21:34.414 --> 21:36.514
I have known much
people and I have seen how

21:36.744 --> 21:38.334
they pass them terrible things.

21:43.993 --> 21:46.093
But you are different.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.153
Hour of leaving.

21:56.384 --> 22:00.117
- He/she tries to relax you, affection.
- Please, don't make it.

22:00.503 --> 22:02.321
You not even know about what it is.

22:02.610 --> 22:03.785
Not I want to die.

22:04.270 --> 22:05.696
I have not harmed them any.

22:05.995 --> 22:06.920
I am a good person.

22:07.209 --> 22:10.104
- It imagines that we are friends.
- Let us speak of this...

22:14.807 --> 22:20.229
It is usually different.
But to you I will kill you.

23:12.283 --> 23:13.840
What do we have?

23:15.190 --> 23:17.933
Does he/she hear, what devils do you make here?

23:20.330 --> 23:23.520
- Who is?
- I don't still know it.

23:24.066 --> 23:27.059
- Veto to house.
- I am well.

24:09.536 --> 24:10.940
Hello!

24:14.293 --> 24:15.370
Hello!

24:21.701 --> 24:25.686
Somebody that helps me!

30:26.514 --> 30:28.648
- Hello? Hello?
- Mom...

30:28.941 --> 30:31.456
Baby, are you?

30:33.827 --> 30:39.281
- Where are you?
- Mom, I love you a lot.

30:40.053 --> 30:45.344
- What do you make, mom?
- He/she is your sister, affection.

30:45.736 --> 30:48.186
Mom, Sadie is dead.

33:04.222 --> 33:06.868
- How do you feel?
- Not very well.

33:07.193 --> 33:11.787
That is work of the physics.
Graveness, concrete.

33:12.141 --> 33:13.666
You chose the worst way
to find out that

33:13.962 --> 33:15.236
you don't die.

33:18.273 --> 33:19.797
Who are?

33:20.476 --> 33:23.665
Somebody that is very
interested in the man

33:23.956 --> 33:26.373
that he/she made you this. Bishop.

33:27.245 --> 33:30.305
- Do you know it?
- You spoke sleeping.

33:31.875 --> 33:35.544
There are two types of people
that they speak while they sleep.

33:36.792 --> 33:41.093
Those that cannot be quiet and
those that have something to say.

33:58.378 --> 34:00.348
There is only a form of killing Bishop.

34:00.933 --> 34:03.033
But before you will have that
to choose among what you want

34:03.423 --> 34:04.403
and what you need.

34:04.669 --> 34:06.770
- I want be alive again.
- Not you can.

34:07.318 --> 34:11.587
Wonder to yourself what you want now.

34:15.398 --> 34:17.694
I want to impede them to make him/her
the same thing to other people.

34:17.983 --> 34:20.824
- We will make it.
- But how the encounter?

34:21.688 --> 34:23.952
I will guide you in your search.

34:28.554 --> 34:29.728
Rourke.

34:30.085 --> 34:30.976
Eve.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.378
Harrison.

34:32.703 --> 34:33.716
Poe.

34:34.013 --> 34:35.025
Bidhop.

34:39.186 --> 34:40.808
How do you know their name?

34:41.101 --> 34:42.179
I know some people.

34:42.538 --> 34:46.752
I will take you until here, then
you will have to continue here.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.302
I will give you some tools.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.453
This is so that you feed.

34:59.111 --> 35:00.733
And when does he/she finish?

35:07.636 --> 35:09.161
Not I can make it.

35:10.702 --> 35:12.553
Not I will kill innocent people.

35:13.385 --> 35:15.801
In all war there is low, Sadie.

35:17.663 --> 35:21.583
And you don't deceive yourself. Nobody is innocent.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.269
Nobody.

35:26.061 --> 35:29.120
From now on, you spread
that to accept your dark side.

35:30.659 --> 35:32.564
You were born again, Sadie.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.019
He/she listens your interior voice.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.968
- In what can I serve you?
- I need a room.

35:54.258 --> 35:56.326
It is well. To happen
the night or per hour?

35:56.621 --> 35:57.567
Different rates.

35:57.802 --> 35:59.870
I need the room
where Rourke is.

36:01.794 --> 36:03.034
Of what do I have face?

36:03.359 --> 36:04.762
Not ask unless you want to know.

36:05.146 --> 36:06.866
- Do you want clothes of Dayana?
- Not I know Dayana.

36:07.573 --> 36:10.121
- To shave?
- Let us begin again.

36:10.415 --> 36:11.786
Wonder in what you can serve me.

36:12.139 --> 36:13.761
- In what can I serve you?
- In what room is Rourke?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.323
310.

36:18.493 --> 36:21.748
- Hear!
- What do you want?

36:22.230 --> 36:23.176
To you.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.090
Miss, what devils did he/she make there up?

36:32.383 --> 36:33.624
He/she calls to the police.

36:34.012 --> 36:35.535
Tell me where I find Eve.

36:38.259 --> 36:40.523
- Who are?
- Where is she?

36:42.346 --> 36:47.997
You nailed it to me very deep.

36:48.286 --> 36:49.939
If you believe that I forgot
the question that I made you

36:50.233 --> 36:51.919
- you are in a serious error.
- Not I know where it is.

36:52.308 --> 36:54.214
- Do I call to the police?
- That was what I told you.

36:58.088 --> 36:59.872
I believe that it should be in Red Angel.

37:00.483 --> 37:03.705
- Do you believe?
- I can take you.

37:04.379 --> 37:05.521
If it is so important.

37:17.150 --> 37:20.624
You won't feel well when
kill for the first time.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.609
But then it will be you easy to eat.

37:26.730 --> 37:29.506
Not let him to affect you.

37:59.588 --> 38:00.382
It was.

38:01.406 --> 38:02.963
- Now.
- Curse.

38:04.504 --> 38:05.996
What was what you told me in the track?

38:06.229 --> 38:09.353
That he/she could not dance
because it was very hot.

38:09.645 --> 38:11.365
How hot!

38:29.666 --> 38:31.037
He/she greets.

38:32.731 --> 38:33.907
She is my sister.

38:36.212 --> 38:37.735
What devils it is
making with that crossbow?

38:38.383 --> 38:41.953
Go, go. Sadie Blake.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.591
Comely to that have
a million questions.

38:45.855 --> 38:47.314
Tell to the boy that leaves.

38:54.413 --> 38:55.555
It is well.

38:59.937 --> 39:03.312
Bishop had already finished
of eating up and you didn't die.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.994
So he/she told me that I finished.

39:07.152 --> 39:09.733
But I never saw anybody resist so much.

39:10.123 --> 39:12.159
You had too much blood.

39:14.369 --> 39:16.666
I knew that you wanted to stay.

39:17.786 --> 39:18.766
It is well.

39:19.159 --> 39:21.042
So you did feel pity?

39:21.330 --> 39:24.487
You have to stop to hate what you are.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.259
I began you, but you finished alone.

39:29.026 --> 39:32.151
- Alone in the morgue.
- Of what are you speaking?

39:33.240 --> 39:35.124
The conversion takes three days.

39:35.412 --> 39:38.123
It is a very delicate process.
It is necessary to know how to make it.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.192
You transformed into one
of us because that

39:40.489 --> 39:42.971
- it was what you wanted.
- Not I am as you.

39:43.651 --> 39:46.460
- Sure?
- Not I am as you.

39:48.823 --> 39:55.072
-  And how is Arturo?
- It belongs one to you.

39:55.433 --> 39:59.070
Not it belongs only one to us.
He controlled everything.

39:59.743 --> 40:03.084
Until Bishop got tired.
Didn't he/she tell you anything of that?

40:04.470 --> 40:07.278
Not you would have made anything
if you knew the truth.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.344
What truth?

40:09.578 --> 40:11.200
That he wants to get rid of Bishop.

40:20.690 --> 40:22.954
I prayed because you arrived, Sadie Blake.

40:29.087 --> 40:32.528
- Is that what you want?
- Not I will have what I want.

40:34.549 --> 40:36.367
Then, make what you came to make.

40:38.669 --> 40:40.574
And good luck.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.794
Harrison will be who betrays Bishop.

41:01.883 --> 41:04.692
But I notice you that not
confuse their disability

41:04.979 --> 41:06.286
with weakness.

41:08.332 --> 41:13.689
He/she will only give you to Bishop
when you give him/her what needs.

41:14.527 --> 41:16.726
And he/she has very specific likes.

41:21.265 --> 41:25.281
1653. Do you know how to drive?
There you will find Bishop.

41:25.639 --> 41:26.717
Now, veto.

41:28.832 --> 41:32.273
Sr. Harrison, we see each other in the hell.

42:37.802 --> 42:39.044
Is it well, young lady?

43:47.604 --> 43:49.194
We go, man, we already happen for this reason.

43:49.488 --> 43:51.872
- But I am coming closer.
- To achieve that they say goodbye to me.

43:52.969 --> 43:54.688
From now on,
you will become invisible.

43:54.884 --> 43:56.702
And I will maintain you to the so much of everything.

43:56.992 --> 44:01.587
He/she remembers that I was me who
he/she brought you to this place.

44:03.602 --> 44:05.061
It is well.

44:06.858 --> 44:08.100
I know how much it means this for you.

44:08.392 --> 44:10.111
You don't know it.

44:11.010 --> 44:13.852
I meant that I can imagine it.

44:14.618 --> 44:16.044
And he/she wanted them to have you
assigned the case officially...

44:17.396 --> 44:20.488
It is well, Joe. I will play ball.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.389
We go, Sadie, you don't have so much urgency.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.130
Without caring how much
lie you to yourself,

44:46.517 --> 44:48.933
your heart is not able to
against your nature.

44:49.966 --> 44:52.774
To face Bishop,
you have to be strong.

44:54.022 --> 44:55.959
If not, all this will have been in vain.

44:59.577 --> 45:00.622
Veto the demon!

45:09.348 --> 45:11.831
- Thank you.
- To where do you go?

45:12.222 --> 45:13.876
Sacred Bбrbara.

45:14.425 --> 45:16.940
But I conform to with
that you leave me to the north.

45:17.682 --> 45:20.458
- My name is Alex.
- Are you of there?

45:21.034 --> 45:24.094
Yes, I came to visit some friends.

45:24.482 --> 45:27.291
We had a party.

45:33.232 --> 45:34.440
Are you hungry?

45:37.702 --> 45:39.259
I am well. Thank you.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.676
- Not you are police, or yes?
- Do I have police print?

45:53.062 --> 45:54.619
That wanted them.

45:57.212 --> 46:01.807
I asked you because
he/she will offer herb.

46:02.258 --> 46:04.108
Ahead. It doesn't bother me.

46:11.646 --> 46:14.901
And then, Alex, are you married?

46:18.161 --> 46:21.154
- Children that to maintain?
- Not that I know.

46:27.101 --> 46:28.308
Girlfriend?

46:29.560 --> 46:31.312
No, truly not.

46:42.875 --> 46:44.051
What do you make?

46:44.503 --> 46:48.292
You already know how we are the women.

46:49.070 --> 46:50.790
Yes, nobody understands them.

46:52.007 --> 46:54.238
Because I go to the grain.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.112
In fact, yes I have girlfriend.

46:57.403 --> 46:58.993
We all lie at some time.

47:03.918 --> 47:08.315
- He/she looks, allow me to finish this.
- Don't worry about me.

48:44.787 --> 48:46.790
Will you come, or will you only look?

48:47.183 --> 48:49.414
Give me a time to relax the view.

48:51.046 --> 48:54.268
They had never told me that.

48:55.133 --> 48:58.574
He/she would make any thing for
to relax the view with you.

48:59.093 --> 49:02.021
To take among my
arms and to take you to house.

49:03.084 --> 49:06.339
Meanwhile, a towel reach me.

49:07.012 --> 49:08.918
At what time is the party tonight?

49:10.078 --> 49:11.416
To the stocking night.

49:12.695 --> 49:17.094
And at what time do we eat?
Are you never hungry?

49:19.176 --> 49:20.418
As.

49:24.669 --> 49:26.737
You speak to me of your family.

49:29.427 --> 49:31.462
Not I speak a lot with my father.

49:32.908 --> 49:35.652
My mom became to
to marry and he/she lives in Reindeer.

49:36.453 --> 49:39.794
And I have a sister that
he/she was born one minute before me.

49:40.475 --> 49:42.990
He/she won't believe me when he/she speaks to him/her of you.

49:45.010 --> 49:46.317
To what do you refer?

49:46.607 --> 49:52.159
We go. Hetero, single,
rich, with sense of humor.

49:53.408 --> 49:58.383
With class. There was never
well-known to somebody as you.

49:58.804 --> 50:01.864
Why did you notice me?

50:02.158 --> 50:05.185
Comely to that were
an adorable virgin.

50:05.670 --> 50:11.321
- To what do you refer?
- Did you bleed a lot?

50:12.791 --> 50:14.194
The first time.

50:16.909 --> 50:18.401
Seriously you do want to know it?

50:18.698 --> 50:22.138
They say that the sex and the murder are those

50:22.434 --> 50:24.437
only pleasures that the man has left you/they.

50:26.202 --> 50:28.085
You are getting scared.

50:30.992 --> 50:33.354
Did I catch you for a moment, truth?

50:35.877 --> 50:38.327
Don't serve the youth, Poe a lot.

50:39.326 --> 50:42.766
He/she has to be walked with
care. The rich bachelors and

50:43.158 --> 50:44.976
elegant almost always
they are some sicуticos.

50:46.127 --> 50:47.269
It is true.

50:56.665 --> 50:59.919
- For the Australian crocodiles.
- Did you speak seriously?

51:00.208 --> 51:01.154
As for what?

51:01.453 --> 51:02.695
At about that the sex
and the murder is those

51:02.923 --> 51:05.786
- the man's pleasures.
- That seems in these times.

51:07.137 --> 51:11.797
- Not I wanted to sound reactionary.
-  And for what reason will you use me?

51:16.908 --> 51:18.628
For both.

53:42.482 --> 53:46.978
Date the turn slowly. Very slowly.

53:50.816 --> 53:52.242
Give me the telephone.

53:56.756 --> 53:59.239
- Where is Bishop?
- He/she didn't tell it to me.

54:26.548 --> 54:29.063
I will facilitate you the things.
You left it in a place.

54:30.507 --> 54:33.882
I cannot say it. He would kill me.

54:34.531 --> 54:35.772
Not he/she will have opportunity.

54:56.116 --> 55:00.297
He/she is escaping. Not he/she knows anything about you.

55:00.586 --> 55:03.548
He/she believes that a policeman pursues him.

55:03.843 --> 55:04.605
What police?

55:04.897 --> 55:08.239
The only thing that knows is it
that it passed to the other ones.

55:08.473 --> 55:09.714
To where does he/she go?

55:11.794 --> 55:14.178
Not make pauses, because
he/she makes me think that you lie.

55:15.945 --> 55:18.525
Not I am afraid of dying.

55:23.673 --> 55:27.657
Good, the things are different now.

55:56.562 --> 55:59.239
- Hello, Bishop.
- Where is Poe?

55:59.563 --> 56:01.827
Not count on him.

56:05.471 --> 56:08.758
- Who does speak?
- Sure you remember me.

56:09.876 --> 56:13.349
- Did I make you something?
- You took off everything.

56:13.516 --> 56:16.097
So you killed to my family.

56:16.390 --> 56:19.003
- And you are the next one.
- I already see.

56:20.031 --> 56:24.212
Why? Not we are so
different, you and me.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.471
You and I only have
, a thing in common.

56:27.183 --> 56:28.674
And that what it is?

56:29.003 --> 56:34.359
When it finishes the night,
both will be dead.

57:05.021 --> 57:07.667
A man used that telephone
as 20 minutes ago.

57:08.152 --> 57:10.731
It is a public phone.
A lot of people use it.

57:11.599 --> 57:14.310
The one that I say has some
30 years, dark hair.

57:15.527 --> 57:18.684
- Are you police?
- Police, lover, mates.

57:18.975 --> 57:19.922
To who does he care it?

57:20.156 --> 57:21.942
Any thing that
remember it could be useful.

57:22.423 --> 57:26.245
The type entered, he/she took a
I swallow, he/she made a call.

57:26.543 --> 57:28.775
Did you dress their car? Did he/she speak with somebody?

57:30.087 --> 57:33.047
No. He/she had never seen it.

57:33.345 --> 57:35.543
If you see it again,
you call me to this number.

57:39.954 --> 57:42.055
Eve. Is your name?

57:47.234 --> 57:50.097
Lament to bother you. But you
I heard speaking with the barman.

57:50.427 --> 57:52.811
- Are you looking for Bishop?
- What do you know about him?

57:53.109 --> 57:53.969
I know where it is.

57:54.228 --> 57:56.078
-  And will you say it?
- I will take you.

57:56.462 --> 57:57.670
I will catch my things.

57:59.975 --> 58:01.880
- Did I exaggerate?
- What do you find?

58:02.178 --> 58:03.158
Help me.

58:08.788 --> 58:10.888
It is well, take you its
car, we see each other there.

58:11.183 --> 58:14.242
- She has the keys.
- What do you make?

58:14.918 --> 58:17.694
- Perhaps he/she has them hide-and-seek.
- Not I can believe that

58:17.983 --> 58:19.191
be warming with
her. iVamos, man!

58:19.868 --> 58:22.992
Calm, brother. What it accuses
do I have him to be a vixen?

59:50.999 --> 59:52.588
Dad.

01:00:08.594 --> 01:00:10.118
- Yes?
- Are you awake?

01:00:10.415 --> 01:00:11.656
Two more cadavers.

01:00:14.757 --> 01:00:18.425
A girl went by the
local pharmacy to buy

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:21.873
- first helps.
- Do they know what direction it takes?

01:00:22.229 --> 01:00:28.293
- I want you to take charge of that.
- I have it.

01:01:14.388 --> 01:01:15.563
I have a he/she arms!

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.804
Not I want to make you I damage.

01:01:39.676 --> 01:01:40.819
Curse!

01:01:52.544 --> 01:01:53.971
I believe that you left my leg.

01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:58.379
- That seems.
- Damned maniac!

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.449
- He/she had a bag. Where is it?
- Which bag, dog?

01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:06.623
- My bag. Where is it?
- He/she has it Dwayne.

01:02:06.945 --> 01:02:08.632
- He was taken your car.
- To where?

01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:10.265
To a called place The Press.

01:02:10.554 --> 01:02:13.232
To some 20 miles of here.

01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:15.851
There it is where Bishop is?

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:19.169
Bishop only told me that it took you to him.

01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:20.736
Did he/she say my name, does he/she know who am?

01:02:21.027 --> 01:02:24.532
No, he/she told me that he/she went to the one
bar and it grabbed anyone

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.026
that he/she asked for him. iEspera!

01:02:28.466 --> 01:02:30.186
How do I go to...?

01:02:42.293 --> 01:02:43.718
- Did something say?
- Anything.

01:02:44.304 --> 01:02:45.643
That was in the car.

01:02:47.179 --> 01:02:50.999
- We will already take it.
- How does he/she call himself?

01:02:51.297 --> 01:02:53.593
Dwayne Musgrove. It is
in freedom low word.

01:02:54.012 --> 01:02:55.831
It is well. I take charge
starting from now.

01:02:56.184 --> 01:02:57.642
- I believe that...
- Give me the keys.

01:03:03.463 --> 01:03:04.704
Will you make it difficult?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.986
Tell me, Dwayne.

01:03:12.787 --> 01:03:16.008
You would say that you are a good one
thief of cars, or one bad?

01:03:17.098 --> 01:03:20.125
Because you believe me, there would not be him
stolen if you had known

01:03:20.418 --> 01:03:21.845
of who it was.

01:03:27.028 --> 01:03:29.031

or you will tell me where
did you find that car?

01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:35.449
- Not I know of what he/she speaks!
- Where?!

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:39.384

Yes.

01:04:17.639 --> 01:04:20.350
You told me that he/she called you
if he/she saw to the type again.

01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:24.434
- Yes.
- Good, it returned to the bar.

01:04:41.555 --> 01:04:43.340
- Where is it?
- Eve?

01:04:45.642 --> 01:04:48.603
- What do you want?
- To make unites questions.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.848
I believe that that is yours.

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:05.565
- I know you.
- Yes?

01:05:05.855 --> 01:05:07.760
Yes. Never forgetfulness a face.

01:05:10.932 --> 01:05:13.795
- Occupational hazards of the occupation.
- Ah, yes?

01:05:14.859 --> 01:05:17.058
I will grab that
bag and I will leave of here.

01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:19.256
I won't harm you if
you don't try to stop.

01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:21.688
- Go condition.
- That depends on you.

01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:27.690
- Only some questions.
- Perhaps in another occasion.

01:05:40.595 --> 01:05:42.282
Loose the bag, put those
hands against the bar.

01:05:42.575 --> 01:05:44.610
You are arrested. You have
right to remain quiet.

01:05:44.971 --> 01:05:46.342
- I need my things!
- I suggest that you welcome yourself

01:05:46.598 --> 01:05:48.633
- to that damned right.
- Listen to me.

01:05:49.089 --> 01:05:51.473
- Not you understand.
- Of course.

01:05:52.059 --> 01:05:55.695
- Everybody is innocent.
- Me not. Neither from a distance.

01:05:59.563 --> 01:06:02.687
Were you? Did you kill her?

01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:04.731
- To who?
- To my daughter.

01:06:06.428 --> 01:06:08.811
- Did you play it?!
- He/she hears, partner, soft.

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:10.961
Behind!

01:06:16.007 --> 01:06:18.107
- Not I am who believe.
- Seriously?

01:06:18.434 --> 01:06:19.740
Not you are a murderess?

01:06:38.582 --> 01:06:40.106
Tricia is the reason for the
which am put in this mess,

01:06:40.466 --> 01:06:43.591
but I didn't kill her. I am
pursuing the one that made it.

01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:46.593
- Of what are you speaking?
- He/she calls himself Bishop.

01:06:48.354 --> 01:06:51.608
I will kill him. And when
that happens, I finished.

01:06:52.823 --> 01:06:54.576
I am no longer a person.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.255
You look at me.

01:06:59.752 --> 01:07:01.276
In the mirror.

01:07:04.797 --> 01:07:06.255
Seriously you don't remind me?

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:12.361
- My name is Sadie Blake.
- That... it is impossible.

01:07:13.514 --> 01:07:15.202
I will kill your daughter's murderer.

01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:18.236
And you can return me the one
favor killing me.

01:07:18.528 --> 01:07:21.369
Let us say that I believe you. Still
I cannot help this way you.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:26.469
You are making me lose
a time that I don't have.

01:07:26.766 --> 01:07:28.073
The keys of the wives.

01:07:44.362 --> 01:07:46.658
We will attempt it of
new. You are arrested.

01:07:47.236 --> 01:07:51.253
I will shoot if you don't stop.
Last warning!

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:08.109
That hurted, damned it is.

01:08:29.225 --> 01:08:33.524
Tylor? Hello?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.212
I will clean to extract the bullet.

01:08:52.535 --> 01:08:54.157
I will throw alcohol.

01:08:56.558 --> 01:08:59.813
- Tell me which your state is.
- I have pain, I am

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.268
- exhausted, bothersome...
- I don't refer to now.

01:09:02.593 --> 01:09:06.413
But to since... it happened. How is it?

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.022
- Pain, fatigue, anger.
-  And the food?

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.031
- What is there with that?
- Not you can live without eating.

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:15.680
You are very skilled to make that
a girl feels comfortable.

01:09:16.642 --> 01:09:18.460
- It proves with another question.
- With how many men

01:09:18.718 --> 01:09:21.939
- have you gone to bed?
- Since I am this way?

01:09:23.508 --> 01:09:25.837
- With none, I suppose.
- Do you suppose?

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:30.461
- Let us return to the food.
- The first.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:36.205
- It excuses.
- Did you have to prove, not?

01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:38.408
I apologize for what comes now.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.286
That was the easy one. This
it will hurt a lot you.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:44.165
There I go.

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:54.831
Hello, Dwayne. Where is it?

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:58.237
Tylor brings it. He/she told me that
we would be here.

01:09:58.536 --> 01:10:00.734
He/she had to bring their car,
but I was not able to, so...

01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:03.224
How did you say that it was seen?

01:10:04.666 --> 01:10:06.386
Man, everything was quick.

01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:09.071
Young.

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:12.893
- Black hair.
- Black.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.924
Asian. It is Asian.

01:10:25.102 --> 01:10:27.779
When he/she came in the one
car, they stopped me, but

01:10:28.072 --> 01:10:30.554
I swear you that I didn't tell him/her anything
to the police on the girl.

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:41.604
Why there would be of
to make it? Thank You, Dwayne.

01:11:07.955 --> 01:11:10.121
Take off the wives.
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:11:13.509 --> 01:11:15.415
You continue being a murderess in series.

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.935
And I hate the surprises. Get up.

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.498
The door is open. Not discuss.

01:11:33.563 --> 01:11:35.054
You are the one that sends.

01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:46.557
You had a relationship
narrow with Tricia?

01:11:50.964 --> 01:11:53.098
Not a lot in the last years.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.840
That doesn't mean me not to care.

01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:01.528
Do you need help?

01:12:02.269 --> 01:12:03.826
In all my life, you are the one
first type that offers

01:12:04.122 --> 01:12:05.711
to go up my pants.

01:12:06.101 --> 01:12:07.527
Not I am here to flirt with you.

01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:13.283
Already coarse of conversations
strangers among us.

01:12:17.022 --> 01:12:19.058
Would you rot?

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.085
Thank you.

01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:37.734
Not I am medical, but never
he/she had seen a fabric

01:12:38.032 --> 01:12:41.854
, that it was regenerated this way. It is incredible.

01:12:42.631 --> 01:12:44.253
Are you becoming personal?

01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:47.984
- I only went up your pants.
- Very amusing.

01:12:48.761 --> 01:12:50.284
Not assume that you know me.

01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:52.812
Will we make this, yes or not?

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.552
He/she remembers which the one is
treatment. I kill Bishop

01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:59.802
- and you kill me.
- I remember it. We go.

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:15.609
The party begins.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.962
He/she looks, we stay together,
without caring what pass.

01:13:29.729 --> 01:13:31.994
I need you to send this for
mail when everything finishes.

01:13:37.168 --> 01:13:38.595
Your mother?

01:13:38.893 --> 01:13:40.416
Not I had opportunity to say goodbye.

01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:18.103
We are waiting visit. Get dressed.

01:14:42.148 --> 01:14:43.574
He/she looks.

01:14:45.884 --> 01:14:49.455
- Blessed Christ!
- Do you know it?

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:52.205
He/she is the boy that stole your car.

01:14:54.124 --> 01:14:57.378
Not it takes a lot of time
there. The blood is fresh.

01:16:09.129 --> 01:16:11.513
- Tricia.
- Dad!

01:16:13.025 --> 01:16:14.071
Tricia!

01:16:25.797 --> 01:16:27.485
It was terrible!

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:32.086
Now already I am here. And not
I will let him to happen to you anything.

01:16:33.812 --> 01:16:35.946
Date hurry. He/she will return soon.

01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:37.738
Sadie!

01:16:43.487 --> 01:16:44.728
- Rawlins.
- Help me, quickly.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:46.392
- Rawlins, get up.
- What does it happen?

01:16:48.373 --> 01:16:49.897
Get up.

01:16:53.386 --> 01:16:55.269
- What does he/she spend?
- It belongs one to them.

01:16:55.749 --> 01:16:58.710
- Bishop converted it.
- Lower the weapon!

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:03.595
- Affection?
- Not I am your affection.

01:17:04.498 --> 01:17:07.426
You disgust me. I hate all that you defend.

01:17:07.755 --> 01:17:09.726
You no longer have to be able to on me.

01:17:10.118 --> 01:17:12.795
- Now I am free.
- Not you are the one that is speaking.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.262
They made you this.

01:17:14.556 --> 01:17:16.341
Bishop predicted that.
,reactionary this way.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:20.072
Because you cannot accept
the idea that I think

01:17:20.368 --> 01:17:22.022
- with my head.
- No.

01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:24.995
Finally I found a place where I fit.

01:17:25.285 --> 01:17:29.748
Tricia. I am your father. I love you.

01:17:30.074 --> 01:17:35.049
Bishop is my father. And
my brother and my lover.

01:17:35.344 --> 01:17:38.685
You would become crazy if you see
the things that me ago.

01:17:39.047 --> 01:17:42.487
He completes me. And you
you are not anything for me.

01:17:43.582 --> 01:17:45.682
- Anything.
- Lower the weapon, now!

01:17:45.977 --> 01:17:48.143
And I won't let you to destroy the
only good that have in the life.

01:17:50.063 --> 01:17:51.238
No!

01:19:00.057 --> 01:19:02.441
- He is not your master!
- Get lost.

01:19:15.095 --> 01:19:16.238
Why do you help him?

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:19.110
He/she wants to get rid of
us. Not he/she understands anything.

01:19:19.407 --> 01:19:21.225
You have five seconds for
to tell me where Bishop is.

01:19:21.929 --> 01:19:22.974
Five.

01:19:24.196 --> 01:19:25.338
Four.

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.786
One.

01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:33.032
Fair when you believe
that there won't be surprises.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.664
It completed 18 next week.

01:19:41.917 --> 01:19:43.539
It has never been in New York.

01:19:45.398 --> 01:19:47.847
I can understand the one
their father's behavior.

01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:51.529
But why do you make this?

01:19:52.298 --> 01:19:54.365
- You belong one to us.
- Not because I chose it.

01:19:54.755 --> 01:19:58.806
To choose? What it is
that? Nobody chooses anything.

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.874
You chose to violate me
and to give me for dead.

01:20:03.888 --> 01:20:05.314
You are being infantile.

01:20:05.612 --> 01:20:08.289
Everything happens for a reason.

01:20:51.434 --> 01:20:55.647
You are deceiving yourself with
the idea of a vengeance.

01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:58.135
Perhaps be only an excuse
to transform into it

01:20:58.426 --> 01:20:59.852
that you are in fact.

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:03.144
Not I am as you.

01:21:04.077 --> 01:21:05.700
Not you believe that all
we are afraid and we are

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:08.030
- confused at the beginning?
- Not I am as you.

01:21:09.059 --> 01:21:12.532
It continues repeating it and such
time you convince yourself to yourself.

01:21:14.615 --> 01:21:15.857
You are crazy.

01:21:16.147 --> 01:21:19.402
My lunatic definition is
a person that believes that

01:21:19.628 --> 01:21:21.315
their don is a curse.

01:21:22.119 --> 01:21:24.568
And he/she believes that he/she doesn't have election.

01:21:26.206 --> 01:21:29.776
I choose to experience
all that the world has

01:21:30.069 --> 01:21:34.250
to offer to change
of an unconscious life.

01:21:36.839 --> 01:21:41.434
Nobody will miss to those
good for anything, Sadie.

01:21:42.108 --> 01:21:47.563
What will you choose, Sadie Blake?

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:51.713
You honest.

01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:55.262
Because you are dead if you are it.

01:21:56.317 --> 01:21:58.135
And you are dead if you are not it.

01:22:00.053 --> 01:22:01.990
I prefer to be dead.

01:22:02.383 --> 01:22:03.624
That it is this way.

01:22:06.663 --> 01:22:08.698
You know, Eve made a mistake regarding you.

01:22:10.909 --> 01:22:14.034
Not you should be another thing
that a beautiful sacrifice.

01:22:15.507 --> 01:22:19.525
In that case, you have taken a lot in dying.

01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:53.371
But he/she always remembers,
Sadie that you are not only made

01:22:53.442 --> 01:22:57.361
of shades. Not you are as them.

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:01.381
That is an it details crucial. He/she is your don.

01:23:23.744 --> 01:23:28.012
- Am I dead?
- Not I know how to answer you.

01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:35.295
I sit down it if you are dead.

01:23:35.591 --> 01:23:37.496
Be quiet.

01:24:01.615 --> 01:24:02.954
This will hurt you.

01:24:11.001 --> 01:24:14.638
- What do you believe that you make?
- Treatment of stopping the hemorrhage.

01:24:16.175 --> 01:24:19.517
It is well, I called reinforcements.
They are already in road.

01:24:20.102 --> 01:24:22.203
Not I arrived until here
to leave walking.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.003
What I mean is that
you cannot even walk.

01:24:26.969 --> 01:24:29.005
I won't leave of here until the dull thing.

01:24:29.299 --> 01:24:30.790
Not you have your cross.

01:24:57.016 --> 01:24:58.061
Stay with me.

01:24:58.421 --> 01:24:59.596
Another time.

01:25:04.742 --> 01:25:06.843
How can you help her?

01:25:07.138 --> 01:25:08.510
She killed your daughter in cold blood.

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:15.370
Go irony.

01:25:22.274 --> 01:25:24.179
All you are same.

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:27.441
They are always about saving
to mistaken people.

01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:29.067
Be quiet.

01:25:31.789 --> 01:25:33.192
Get up, Sadie.

01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:48.356
I will tell you the truth about your daughter.

01:25:48.649 --> 01:25:50.499
At the beginning I found
similar to the other ones.

01:25:50.851 --> 01:25:52.670
A confused adolescent.

01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:55.919
But while more he/she knew it,
and I refer to know it

01:25:56.216 --> 01:25:59.503
very thoroughly, more you
he/she made me a revelation.

01:26:03.688 --> 01:26:08.282
Your girl was wonderful. You should know it.

01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:14.410
Allow it to go.

01:26:15.598 --> 01:26:17.600
It is certain what you/they told me of you.

01:26:18.152 --> 01:26:22.104
At the end always flaws. No
you pay attention to the details.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.860
Lament that of your daughter.

01:26:46.316 --> 01:26:47.393
Seriously that yes.

01:26:50.626 --> 01:26:52.248
It was already dead.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.344
Me also.

01:27:02.441 --> 01:27:04.738
We go, it finishes with this.

01:27:10.647 --> 01:27:12.072
Not think.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.711
- Only make it.
- Sadie.

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:18.689
You owe it to me.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:21.176
Not I can live this way.

01:27:24.633 --> 01:27:25.972
Make it.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.703
Please.
