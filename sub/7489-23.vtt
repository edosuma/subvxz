WEBVTT

00:04.469 --> 00:07.835
Guess who got a job as a Coach
on America's Top Talent?

00:07.836 --> 00:10.223
I love that show.
How'd you get on it?

00:10.224 --> 00:13.678
I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about you and Ally.

00:13.679 --> 00:15.847
You guys are gonna be guest
coaches on the show.

00:15.848 --> 00:16.881
- No way.
- Seriously?

00:16.882 --> 00:18.464
Yeah. They're coming to Miami.

00:18.465 --> 00:21.148
And all the contestants are
gonna sing Austin Moon songs

00:21.149 --> 00:23.364
because it's Austin Moon week.

00:23.365 --> 00:24.689
This is so exciting!

00:24.690 --> 00:28.154
- Trish, you're the best manager ever.
- I know!

00:28.155 --> 00:31.224
We get to help aspiring
singers get their big break.

00:31.225 --> 00:34.047
Yeah. And I'm getting
my own week.

00:34.048 --> 00:36.210
First thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna get rid of Monday

00:36.211 --> 00:39.737
and replace it with Friday
and call it Moonday.

00:39.738 --> 00:44.252
And since I got you the gig, you
should call Tuesday Trish day.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.251
Nah. That would be silly.

00:47.252 --> 00:49.014
I can't wait.

00:49.015 --> 00:52.341
Austin, we're gonna be
making dreams come true.

00:52.342 --> 00:54.427
What up?

00:54.428 --> 00:57.248
Dude! That's our thing.

00:57.249 --> 01:00.644
Sorry, Dez. I just got excited.

01:00.645 --> 01:04.245
- What up?
- That's better.

02:03.236 --> 02:04.853
Oh hey, guys.
Welcome to the set.

02:04.854 --> 02:06.625
- Hey, Jett.
- Good to see you.

02:06.626 --> 02:11.551
Wow. The set looks so much bigger than
when I watch the show on my phone.

02:11.552 --> 02:15.509
It's the spinning chairs. Oh, I
wish I could take one in my house.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.243
You can't just walk on a set and take
stuff that doesn't belong to you.

02:19.244 --> 02:22.282
Check out this cool
jacket I found backstage.

02:22.283 --> 02:24.478
- That's mine.
- Oh.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.249
Well, you should really
put your name on things.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.290
I did.

02:29.591 --> 02:30.940
Hmm.

02:30.941 --> 02:33.002
Hey, Jett, can we check out
the spinning chairs now?

02:33.003 --> 02:35.661
Oh, we don't let anybody sit
in those until showtime.

02:35.662 --> 02:37.691
The spinning mechanisms
are really delicate.

02:37.692 --> 02:39.616
Woo! Whee!

02:39.617 --> 02:42.797
Get out of that chair!

02:43.451 --> 02:46.072
Woo. I love being dizzy.

02:46.073 --> 02:49.013
Wait. No, I don't.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.648
Dez, wait up. We're gonna go
make a team Austin & Ally sign.

02:54.649 --> 02:57.050
Oh, that's sweet. You
want to support us.

02:57.051 --> 03:01.054
No. The people who make the best
signs always get put on camera.

03:01.055 --> 03:04.115
I want to be on TV.

03:04.859 --> 03:08.317
So do you guys want a tour or
should I just see you on camera?

03:08.318 --> 03:14.218
- Actually, a tour would be...
- Great. I'll see you on camera.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.877
Sorry to bother you. But are you
Austin Dawson and Ally Moon?

03:18.878 --> 03:21.263
Uh, sort of.

03:21.264 --> 03:24.944
Sorry. I'm nervous. I'm Lucy,
a contestant on the show.

03:24.945 --> 03:27.914
Well, we can't wait
to hear you sing.

03:27.915 --> 03:30.334
I can't believe I'm
actually meeting you guys.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.887
I don't know what to do.
Somebody tell me what to do.

03:33.888 --> 03:37.524
Lucy, relax. I understand why
you're a little nervous.

03:37.525 --> 03:39.926
I used to get that way
before I performed.

03:39.927 --> 03:42.564
Thanks, Ally. You're
like my hero.

03:42.565 --> 03:45.031
Please don't think I'm weird.

03:45.032 --> 03:48.572
No one thinks you're weird.

03:48.836 --> 03:52.092
Okay. She's a little weird.

03:52.093 --> 03:54.278
I liked her.

03:54.279 --> 03:56.009
Isn't she hilarious?

03:56.010 --> 03:57.744
That's our joke contestant.

03:57.745 --> 03:59.145
What do you mean, joke?

03:59.146 --> 04:01.971
Oh, we always have one contestant
that has no shot of winning,

04:01.972 --> 04:05.715
but they make the
audience laugh and laugh.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.393
That's terrible.

04:07.394 --> 04:10.162
Remember last year when the kid
came and sang with his parrot,

04:10.163 --> 04:15.263
but the coaches picked the
parrot instead of him?

04:15.455 --> 04:18.755
I mean, that's terrible.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.974
Welcome to America's Top Talent.

04:27.975 --> 04:32.045
I'm Jett Deely. We're coming to you
live from Miami for Austin Moon week.

04:32.046 --> 04:34.047
Let's go ahead and meet
our guest coaches.

04:34.048 --> 04:36.924
First up, she says she's
a rising music producer

04:36.925 --> 04:38.988
who will do anything
to get to the top...

04:38.989 --> 04:41.449
Val Crawford.

04:43.755 --> 04:48.735
He's right. I'm ruthless
and I lack integrity.

04:49.198 --> 04:52.061
Next up, he's the editor
of Miami Music Magazine.

04:52.062 --> 04:53.408
The caped critic himself...

04:53.409 --> 04:56.409
Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

04:59.249 --> 05:03.488
This is so bunny rabbit.
I feel warm, fuzzy...

05:03.489 --> 05:06.130
And I want to jump for joy.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.166
And finally, we
love their music.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.665
She writes, he rocks.

05:09.666 --> 05:14.406
Give it up for Ally
Dawson and Austin Moon!

05:16.924 --> 05:18.859
Thanks, Jett. We're
happy to be here.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.769
And thank you, America,
for all of your support.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.015
You know, a lot of people don't
realize the importance...

05:24.016 --> 05:26.800
Thank you, Ally Dawson.

05:26.801 --> 05:30.103
Oh, you got some pretty supportive fans
in the audience. Look at that sign.

05:30.104 --> 05:32.265
This is it. We're
gonna be on TV.

05:32.266 --> 05:35.775
Oh, but it's not as big as that
sign for Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

05:35.776 --> 05:39.316
Get a camera on those fans.

05:39.698 --> 05:42.110
Of course their sign's bigger.
His name's longer.

05:42.111 --> 05:45.172
I didn't put all this work into
our sign not to get on TV.

05:45.173 --> 05:46.962
Uh, I did all the work.

05:46.963 --> 05:50.090
Right. So it's all your fault.

05:50.091 --> 05:51.565
Before we meet our contestants,

05:51.566 --> 05:54.939
let's welcome back the winners of
last year's America's Top Talent...

05:54.940 --> 05:57.640
Chloe and Halle!

05:59.800 --> 06:03.510
Hey, girls. So, do you have any
advice for this year's contestants?

06:03.511 --> 06:05.839
- To work hard.
- Follow your dreams.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.320
And have a talented sister.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.682

07:27.021 --> 07:30.861
Give it up for Chloe and Halle.

07:33.861 --> 07:36.061
Now it's time to meet
our contestants.

07:36.062 --> 07:38.810
Coaches, when you find a performer
that you want to mentor,

07:38.811 --> 07:40.320
spin your chair in a circle.

07:40.321 --> 07:45.241
And remember, if you
spin it, they are in it!

07:45.318 --> 07:47.793
We gotta make sure we pick
a contestant who can win.

07:47.794 --> 07:52.535
Oh, we're gonna win because we're
much better coaches than those fools.

07:52.536 --> 07:56.196
You realize your mics are on?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.180
Sorry.

07:58.181 --> 08:00.821
You're awesome!

08:01.789 --> 08:04.576
<i>♪ Come on and give it

<i>♪ And break... break

08:09.067 --> 08:10.664
She's really good.
We should pick her.

08:10.665 --> 08:12.232
- Let's spin our chair.
- I don't know.

08:12.233 --> 08:15.353
Too late. She's mine.

08:19.217 --> 08:21.333
<i>♪ You're legit, you're the boss.</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.822
<i>♪ Even when the mic is off.</i>

08:23.823 --> 08:26.459
<i>♪ Nobody rocks it,

08:26.460 --> 08:28.263
Okay this guy's a winner
let's spin our chair.

08:28.264 --> 08:31.984
- Hold on.
- I choose Clayton!

08:35.852 --> 08:37.962
He's so baby eagle.

08:37.962 --> 08:43.863
With my nurturing, one day he
will spread his wings and soar!

08:44.278 --> 08:49.078
Now our next contestant,
little Lucy Gluckman.

08:50.409 --> 08:52.929
Lucy Gluckman.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.193
I was in the bathroom.

08:58.194 --> 09:02.044
Sorry. You didn't
need to know that.

09:02.045 --> 09:05.651
Okay. I guess I'll sing now.

09:05.652 --> 09:08.441
<i>♪ I'm standing at a crossroads.</i>

09:12.621 --> 09:15.058
Well, we know who's
not getting picked.

09:15.059 --> 09:17.060
We choose Lucy!

09:17.061 --> 09:18.294
Seriously?

09:18.295 --> 09:19.295
Seriously?

09:19.296 --> 09:21.131
Seriously?

09:21.132 --> 09:22.714
Seriously?

09:22.715 --> 09:24.935
Seriously?

09:35.079 --> 09:36.881
What are you guys doing?

09:36.882 --> 09:39.984
These big balloons are
guaranteed to get us on TV.

09:39.985 --> 09:42.549
We're gonna write Austin
& Ally rock on them.

09:42.550 --> 09:44.410
Huh.

09:44.686 --> 09:47.266
Oh, not again!

09:52.046 --> 09:53.617
I don't even know why
we're doing this.

09:53.618 --> 09:56.736
Do we really want to be seen
supporting that awkward weird girl?

09:56.737 --> 09:59.137
- Hey.
- I wasn't talking about you.

09:59.138 --> 10:01.101
I was talking about the
other awkward weird girl.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.241
Double hey.

10:02.242 --> 10:04.682
He's right. We should
have never picked Lucy.

10:04.683 --> 10:08.742
- She's just there as a joke.
- Lucy is not a joke.

10:08.743 --> 10:13.353
She has a good voice and with our
coaching, I think she can win.

10:13.354 --> 10:15.433
Austin, you saw the
potential in me.

10:15.434 --> 10:18.923
And I see the potential in her.

10:18.924 --> 10:20.759
Okay, Ally. Maybe you're right.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.828
I mean, you turned out pretty
great, and you were a real mess.

10:23.829 --> 10:25.859
Triple hey.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.099
Whatever.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.236
You're on board, and the Lucy
train's leaving the station.

10:30.237 --> 10:34.677
Chugga chugga chugga chugga...
whoo whoo!

10:46.051 --> 10:48.429
Welcome back to
America's Top Talent.

10:48.430 --> 10:52.186
Tonight we see our final
performances and we pick our winner.

10:52.187 --> 10:56.178
But before we do that, let's see how our
coaches got their contestants ready.

10:56.179 --> 10:58.488
The most important part
about a Coach-performer

10:58.489 --> 11:01.020
relationship is mutual respect.

11:01.021 --> 11:06.241
It's more of a partnership
than a one-way street.

11:06.630 --> 11:09.000
Should I do some vocal warm-ups?

11:09.001 --> 11:13.462
Do you not see me
talking to this camera?

11:13.463 --> 11:15.130
Where was I?

11:15.131 --> 11:19.091
Oh yes, respect for
the performer.

11:20.448 --> 11:25.608
Clayton, to win, you must
make the camera love you.

11:25.609 --> 11:27.194
Watch.

11:27.195 --> 11:29.615
Hello, camera.

11:29.616 --> 11:33.016
- I am Jean Paul Paul-Jean.
- You look beautiful.

11:33.017 --> 11:35.533
Did you get a haircut? Mmm.

11:35.534 --> 11:38.488
Are you busy this Friday night?

11:38.489 --> 11:40.774
We think Lucy's really talented.

11:40.775 --> 11:43.323
She just needs to be
more sure of herself.

11:43.324 --> 11:46.064
Oh, I'm very sure of myself.

11:46.065 --> 11:48.146
Aren't I?

11:48.147 --> 11:51.949
The first thing we worked
on was her dancing.

11:51.950 --> 11:56.301
She really needed a pro to show
her how to dance with some style.

11:56.302 --> 12:01.282
Which is why I stepped
in as soon as possible.

12:04.116 --> 12:06.240
Then we worked on her volume.

12:06.241 --> 12:07.543
She's kind of shy.

12:07.544 --> 12:10.736
<i>♪ It's like I'm
balanced on the edge.</i>

12:10.737 --> 12:14.295
<i>♪ Looks like I'm
hanging by a thread.</i>

12:14.296 --> 12:18.945
So we brought in some specialists to
train her in the nicest way possible.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.759
<i>- ♪ It's like I'm hanging...
- Come on, Lucy! Let's hear it.</i>

12:21.760 --> 12:25.651
- I can't hear you! What?! What?!
- Keep going! All the way.

12:25.652 --> 12:27.736
- Louder. Project.
- Still can't hear you.

12:27.737 --> 12:29.558
<i>♪ Don't look down. Down down...</i>

12:29.559 --> 12:30.990
Come on, Lucy.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.807
We noticed she had some trouble
looking up when she sings.

12:33.808 --> 12:35.858
We tried everything.

12:35.859 --> 12:38.836
Finally, I had no choice.

12:38.837 --> 12:42.737
Ally put my head in a dog cone.

12:42.769 --> 12:45.988
Then we had a discussion
about what song to sing.

12:45.989 --> 12:48.741
You're singing don't look down.
End of discussion.

12:48.742 --> 12:52.818
I just don't think it's right for me.
I'd rather sing the song who I am.

12:52.819 --> 12:56.953
Don't look down is the song I sang the
first time I felt confident on stage.

12:56.954 --> 12:59.366
It worked for me,
it'll work for you.

12:59.367 --> 13:03.686
Uh... don't you think we should let
her sing what she's comfortable with?

13:03.687 --> 13:06.143
She doesn't know what
she's comfortable with.

13:06.144 --> 13:07.226
I do.

13:07.227 --> 13:10.955
And I'm gonna do everything I can to
make her comfortable with who she is.

13:10.956 --> 13:15.156
Now let's go change
her entire look!

13:15.228 --> 13:17.670
I think Lucy's right
where we want her to be.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.673
Yeah, she's gonna
blow you guys away.

13:20.674 --> 13:25.174
That's what you wanted
me to say, right?

13:26.513 --> 13:29.648
Good stuff. Now let's
meet our contestants.

13:29.649 --> 13:33.129
Quick, hold up the balloon.

13:33.876 --> 13:37.275
Hey, would you look at those balloons? How
clever, get some cameras on these fans.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.622
Oh, this is it.
He's coming to us.

13:39.623 --> 13:41.593
How's my hair?

13:41.594 --> 13:44.297
Oh, there goes their balloon.

13:44.298 --> 13:46.404
And their chance to
be on television.

13:46.405 --> 13:52.285
But hey, those Jean Paul fans
have really outdone themselves.

13:54.097 --> 13:56.185
Now let's meet Jean
Paul's protege.

13:56.186 --> 13:59.767
You knew him as Clayton Vanderbilt,
but now you know him as...

13:59.768 --> 14:03.848
Clayton Vanderbilt
Vanderbilt-Clayton.

14:06.743 --> 14:09.281
He is so African elephant.

14:09.282 --> 14:13.296
He's big, loud and he'll
trample the competition.

14:13.297 --> 14:16.605
Oh, he also likes peanuts.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.413
Next, let's meet
Val's contestant.

14:18.414 --> 14:24.314
You knew her as Agnes Roach,
now you know her as Fiona Fox.

14:27.597 --> 14:33.497
Lock up your chicken coop, because Fiona Fox
is gonna bust in and eat you for lunch!

14:36.111 --> 14:37.666
Disturbing.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.144
Ah. And now our
final contestant.

14:40.145 --> 14:46.045
You met her as little Lucy Gluckman,
but now she's little Lucy G.

14:46.076 --> 14:47.609
Whoa!

14:47.610 --> 14:51.513
I was expecting Lucy Gluckman.
Not a glamorous fashion model.

14:51.514 --> 14:53.862
So what do you think
of the new you?

14:53.863 --> 14:57.643
Well, I liked my old self, but
Ally said I wasn't working.

14:57.644 --> 15:01.490
She said to be successful,
I can't be myself.

15:01.491 --> 15:03.912
That's not what I was
trying to teach her.

15:03.913 --> 15:06.913
Well, lesson learned.

15:07.719 --> 15:10.289
I can't believe
Lucy thinks that.

15:10.290 --> 15:13.388
I can. You were kind of out
of control coaching her.

15:13.389 --> 15:16.862
You made her wear a dog cone.

15:16.863 --> 15:20.122
I was just trying to help her. You saw
her when she first came out here.

15:20.123 --> 15:21.706
She was the joke contestant.

15:21.707 --> 15:23.507
Oh!

15:24.568 --> 15:26.515
You think I'm a joke?

15:26.516 --> 15:28.175
No, I...

15:28.176 --> 15:30.516
Lucy, wait!

15:41.342 --> 15:44.250
Lucy, I am so sorry.

15:44.251 --> 15:46.137
I don't think you're a joke.

15:46.138 --> 15:47.982
Then why'd you say that?

15:47.983 --> 15:49.712
Because...

15:49.713 --> 15:53.086
The show only put you on so
people could laugh at you.

15:53.087 --> 15:57.454
Oh, like the funny
guy with the parrot?

15:57.455 --> 16:00.035
Wait. Oh, man.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.881
I'm this year's
funny parrot guy?

16:01.882 --> 16:05.376
You were supposed to
be, but you're not.

16:05.377 --> 16:08.168
You're special and I
have faith in you.

16:08.169 --> 16:11.071
Then why did you change
everything about me?

16:11.072 --> 16:13.361
Okay. Good point. Look...

16:13.362 --> 16:16.390
I wanted to give you confidence.

16:16.391 --> 16:20.993
But I realize now the way to do that
wasn't to make you a new person.

16:20.994 --> 16:23.984
It was to make you believe
in who you already are.

16:23.985 --> 16:25.731
I do believe in myself.

16:25.732 --> 16:28.088
Wait, do I?

16:28.089 --> 16:33.989
Lucy, go out there, have fun, and
sing whatever song you want to.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.834
Just...

16:37.870 --> 16:41.110
Remember to be yourself.

16:41.236 --> 16:45.039
No matter what, I'll
be proud of you.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.840
Aw.

16:49.210 --> 16:52.930
You know your mic's still on.

16:56.317 --> 17:01.957
And now, let's welcome back
to the stage little Lucy G.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.423
Correction. It's
little Lucy Gluckman.

17:07.424 --> 17:09.096
Woo!

17:09.097 --> 17:10.854
This song's called who I am.

17:10.855 --> 17:16.269

that is, but let's hear it anyway.

21:24.278 --> 21:27.208
There is no way she
got all the votes.

21:27.209 --> 21:30.092
So she must be a Cheetah.

21:30.093 --> 21:31.449
Face it, guys.

Moon week here in Miami.

Let's say goodnight
to our guest coaches,

Austin, Ally, Val, and
Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

21:57.478 --> 21:59.479
Hey. It's Trish and Dez.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.200
Our plan worked. We're on TV!

22:04.823 --> 22:06.923
This is so unicorn.

22:06.924 --> 22:09.804
Magical and unreal!

22:11.446 --> 22:15.526
What happened to
Val and Jean Paul?

22:16.898 --> 22:20.400
The kid on the phone said there
was a baked potato bar back here.

22:20.401 --> 22:21.995
But I don't see one.

22:21.996 --> 22:24.841
Hmm. This is so mosquito.

22:24.842 --> 22:27.177
Annoying and it
stings a little bit.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.593
Mmm.
