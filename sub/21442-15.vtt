00:08.241 --> 00:10.043
- What's up, guys? Welcome
to "The Dude Perfect Show"!

00:10.110 --> 00:12.846
Today, we've got some
very special guests with us.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.214
Our pups!

00:14.280 --> 00:15.715
Hey! Ah-ah!

00:15.782 --> 00:16.649
This is Sadie.

00:16.716 --> 00:17.650
- This is Sully.

00:17.717 --> 00:18.885
- This is Trooper.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.754
- Anyways, we've been invited
to a dog show.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.456
It's not an official dog show,
but it's kind of a fun match

00:23.523 --> 00:25.358
where we get to go participate
with some other dogs

00:25.425 --> 00:27.260
that are kinda new
to the whole program.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.529
The problem is,
there's one spot for a DP dog,

00:29.596 --> 00:31.498
so we've gotta pick between
these three to see

00:31.564 --> 00:34.868
who's gonna represent
Dude Perfect in the DP Dog Show.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.636
Pups, you guys ready to do it?

00:36.703 --> 00:37.771
Let's go!

00:37.837 --> 00:39.639
Come on!
- Come on, Sul!

00:39.706 --> 00:44.744
- ♪

00:44.811 --> 00:47.881
♪ La, la, la,
here we go, go, go ♪

00:47.947 --> 00:51.017
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, go, go ♪

00:51.084 --> 00:53.787
♪ La, la, la, here we go ♪♪

00:53.853 --> 00:55.989
- ♪

00:56.055 --> 00:58.458
- Only one dog
can represent Dude Perfect

00:58.525 --> 01:00.093
in the upcoming dog show.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.562
We are here to figure out
whose dog that will be.

01:02.629 --> 01:03.897
- Come on, Trooper!

01:03.963 --> 01:05.732
- Why don't you show us
what Trooper's got?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.133
- What do you mean
what he's got?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.735
- What kind of tricks?
- Oh, tricks?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.403
Oh, trick--uh, Trooper.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.638
Don't move a muscle.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.440
- [panting]

01:13.506 --> 01:15.175
- GARRETT: That's pretty good.
- Okay.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.010
Does he do like any
of the traditional tricks?

01:17.076 --> 01:19.512
Like a sit, stay,
shake kind of thing?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.314
- Definitely no.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.716
- Okay. Alright,
so during the dog show,

01:23.783 --> 01:25.051
I think there is
a little section

01:25.118 --> 01:26.486
when you kinda
gotta do like a walk-around.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.221
So maybe just do
a little loop around us

01:28.288 --> 01:29.589
and let's see how he walks.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.391
- Okay, so here we go.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.426
- [laughing]

01:37.163 --> 01:38.665
- I like your dog trot.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.266
- I can't take that seriously.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.069
I gotta say,
you are on a fast pace

01:43.136 --> 01:45.271
to being the number-one dog.
- I agree.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.940
I like what I'm seeing,
because you gotta remember,

01:47.006 --> 01:48.541
whatever dog we choose here,

01:48.608 --> 01:51.077
we're still gonna send
to training before the show.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.912
So they're gonna get
a little bit of extra tune-up.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.047
Alright, Gar.
- Yeah.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.583
- Love to see some tricks
from Sullivan.

01:56.649 --> 01:59.252
- Sully, sit.
- Wow!

01:59.319 --> 02:02.589
- Shake!
- Oh, very nice.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.624
- Lay down.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.026
- What about fetch
or something like that?

02:07.093 --> 02:08.193
- Yeah, probably not.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.929
- Okay.
How 'bout a walk and trot?

02:09.996 --> 02:11.598
- Oh, yeah, the walk and trot.

02:11.664 --> 02:15.235
So as I was told in my obedience
class, you wanna be the alpha.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.770
So just watch me be the alpha.

02:17.837 --> 02:18.905
- It sounds dangerous.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.040
- This should be good, Gar.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.509
Alpha, Gar, alpha.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.077
- Yeah, Sully, this way.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.613
- Seems like there's more
dragging than actual walking.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.281
- We haven't really
worked on the trot.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.482
- Okay.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.184
- But appearance wise,
I feel like he's a ten.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.318
- Appearance, great.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.854
So obedience,
I'd say pretty good.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.523
Walk and trot pretty good.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.691
Off-the-leash training,
little questionable.

02:38.758 --> 02:39.826
- Yeah.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.928
- So this is Sadie Swift Toney.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.129
- Oh, nice.

02:43.196 --> 02:44.564
- Named after Taylor herself.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.032
- Oh nice, I like that.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.767
- So I'll just run through
some tricks with her.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.868
Sadie, heel.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.303
Sit.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.438
- You're the alpha
in this situation.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.807
- Sit.

02:54.874 --> 02:55.975
- Oh wow.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.310
I could not do that.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.345
- Here.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.680
Sit.

03:00.747 --> 03:01.814
- Trooper, take notes.

03:01.881 --> 03:02.982
- GARRETT: Yeah.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.250
Sully is paying close attention.

03:04.317 --> 03:05.919
- You guys wanna see
our walk and trot?

03:05.985 --> 03:06.886
- CODY: Please.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.187
- TYLER: Okay, Said, heel.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.923
- Yeah, I don't know
what you're doing. Trotting?

03:09.989 --> 03:11.991
It just seems--feels weird.
Feels wrong.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.059
- Your trot seems off.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.694
- Yeah. The dog looks great.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.995
Calibrate again.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.664
- Am I supposed to be
trotting or walking?

03:17.730 --> 03:19.699
- I don't--not that.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.167
You look like a rooster.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.902
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.771
- Sully does not like
the way you trot.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.039
- [laughs] Okay.
- Very offensive.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.173
- Okay.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.709
- You know, I gotta say,
Sadie, A plus.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.045
You unfortunately--woooo,

03:32.111 --> 03:33.680
we gotta put you
in some lessons there.

03:33.746 --> 03:36.382
- Hey, I agree. I think I could
use a little bit of help

03:36.449 --> 03:38.585
on the old walk and trot,
but I think she might have

03:38.651 --> 03:40.486
what it takes when it comes down
to crunch time.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.522
- As long as you're willing
to put in the work,

03:42.589 --> 03:43.790
you've got my vote.
- Absolutely.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.158
- Got our vote.
- [applause]

03:45.224 --> 03:46.960
- I think we found
our dogs, boys.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.828

04:12.251 --> 04:13.519
- Hey, we're not
worried about Sadie.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.254
Worried about you, sir.
- How's it going?

04:15.321 --> 04:16.389

04:16.456 --> 04:17.991
- Nice to meet you, Rachel.
I'm Tyler.

- Hi, Glory.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.327
This is Sadie.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.795
- We appreciate you
coming out here

04:22.862 --> 04:24.097
{\an8}and setting all this up for us.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.965
{\an8}This should be good time.
- Sure, I'm happy to.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.300
{\an8}- We're training
for a dog show.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.369
And Sadie was the best
out of all of our dogs.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.204
But it's mostly Tyler
we're worried about.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.372
- Appreciate that, boys.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.273
- Don't worry,
that's pretty typical.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.409
We're usually working with
a human just as much as the dog.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.311
- That's good.
- So why don't we step over

04:38.378 --> 04:40.179
to a jump and see how Sadie does
with jumping?

04:40.246 --> 04:41.614
- This is gonna be interesting.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.317
- Lead her over here, and have
her stop in front of the jump.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.686
And you come to the other side
of it and call her over

04:46.753 --> 04:49.255
and give her a treat.
- Got it. Sadie, sit.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.659
- No way.
- No way.

04:52.725 --> 04:53.693
- Come here, Sadie.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.962
- Oooh! Smart dog!

04:56.029 --> 04:58.531
- Okay, you saw me walk around.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.366
It thought, "Hey, why don't I
do the same thing?"

05:00.433 --> 05:01.868
- Maybe you should do
a hop-skie,

05:01.934 --> 05:04.570
and then she'll do one as well.
- Okay, I'll give it a hop-skie.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.140
Sit.
- Ty can't even jump that high.

05:07.206 --> 05:10.043
- [laughing] Uh-oh,
in the flip flops.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.144
[grunts]
- Oh my--

05:11.210 --> 05:13.713
- Come here. Oh, there we go.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.548
- You leading
actually helped a lot.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.550
I think you need to go through
the whole course,

05:17.617 --> 05:19.686
show her how it's done.
And then she'll know.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.020
- I agree.
- What?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.222
- I think that's a good call.
- Rachel, does that help?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.391
- It's a little unconventional,
but it can't hurt.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.227
I mean, you can give it a shot.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.328
- [imitates a beep]

Watch and do as he does.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.611
- Nice!
- He's very frog like.

05:45.678 --> 05:49.148
- And weave, Ty, weave, weave.
- Faster weaver.

Go in the tunnel.

- You know what, dude?

06:22.348 --> 06:24.050
She didn't know where to go.
We were close.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.718
- Victory trot, hey!

06:25.785 --> 06:28.588
- Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!

Stay with me, stay with me,
oh, oh, oh!

06:30.923 --> 06:33.526
- So do you maybe wanna fix
that trot a little bit?

06:33.593 --> 06:35.027
- What do I need to change?

06:35.094 --> 06:39.398
- So maybe bend your knees
a little bit when you run.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.367
- I'm telling you, they don't
do that when--they walk

06:41.434 --> 06:43.503
like this when they do it.
- No, they don't.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.773
- Yes, they do. So you're just
saying more just like a--

06:46.839 --> 06:48.841
- There you go.
More like a natural run.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.177
- It's almost a high knee.
- Keep your head still.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.146
- But try to keep it smooth.
- There you go.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.280
- That's better.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.681
- It's more like head's even
like this.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.550
- Cody, that's
actually really good.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.585
- I told you I saw it,
and I was like,

06:59.652 --> 07:01.454
"That's what I gotta look like."

07:01.521 --> 07:02.889
- I think
you're getting it down.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.257
You look a lot more natural.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.958
- I think that's a lot better.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.360
- Rachel, thank you very much.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.661
Appreciate all your help.

- Absolutely.

Better go throw her a ball.
She found the ball bag.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.767
Okay, I'll throw it to you.
