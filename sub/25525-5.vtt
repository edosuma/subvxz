13:17.159 --> 13:20.126
Why would I sacrifice my only
daughter for something like that?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.277

14:10.466 --> 14:12.021
to be delivered to the Prime Order

14:12.027 --> 14:13.672
in the event of my untimely death.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.684
Which means they haven't
been delivered already.

14:17.883 --> 14:19.984
That tells me you want
something for your silence.

14:21.399 --> 14:23.436
Your Majesty is wise beyond her years.

14:23.442 --> 14:24.769
Get to the point.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.693
I simply seek justice.

14:27.542 --> 14:30.009
Give up Talon. Your friend.

14:30.595 --> 14:32.162
She's to be executed

14:32.197 --> 14:34.623
and her body delivered
to the Prime Order.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.654
Of all the things, why that?

14:36.903 --> 14:39.241
Why is her death so important to you?

14:39.247 --> 14:41.739
Because this is our
only chance to protect

14:41.745 --> 14:43.714
the Outpost from the Prime Order!

14:44.043 --> 14:46.177
My Outpost!

14:47.423 --> 14:50.424
They will surely take control.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.284
And in that event,

14:54.255 --> 14:56.654
you stand to lose more than I do.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.960
A true leader must
sometimes sacrifice one

15:06.804 --> 15:08.249
for the good of many.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.701
WYTHERS: Listen to your father.

15:11.183 --> 15:13.217
He of all people should understand.

15:13.252 --> 15:15.910
Don't you dare try and
dignify blackmail.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.838
He calls me Majesty and extorts
me in the same breath.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.319
If... If I agree,

15:27.208 --> 15:29.212
Garret will accompany you immediately

15:29.218 --> 15:31.185
to destroy the dispatches
you have prepared.

15:31.191 --> 15:34.125
After which he'd put his
sword through my heart,

15:34.161 --> 15:35.827
something he's longed to do for years.

15:35.862 --> 15:37.725
No. The letters stay where they are.

15:37.731 --> 15:40.015
So you can make more
demands, once Talon is dead.

15:40.103 --> 15:42.003
I just wanna do my job.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.672
Grant me that,

15:44.506 --> 15:46.686
and your secret is safe.

15:54.811 --> 15:56.681
So be it.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.798
To satisfy the law,

16:00.233 --> 16:02.767
Talon will be executed.

16:03.594 --> 16:05.523
Immediately?

16:06.648 --> 16:07.729
Immediately.

16:14.901 --> 16:16.768
Shh!

16:17.671 --> 16:19.404
I've killed men for less.

16:19.439 --> 16:21.373
Watchmen are coming.

16:21.408 --> 16:23.508
The Mistress told them you're down here.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.710
[GROANS] She did see me.

16:25.746 --> 16:27.962
Wythers gave the order to
have you killed on sight.

16:27.968 --> 16:29.987
- But Gwynn...
- No, the things have changed.

16:30.003 --> 16:31.669
All right, Gwynn can't
protect you anymore.

16:31.705 --> 16:33.234
- Why?
- My father, he...

16:33.240 --> 16:34.573
Look, there's a lot to explain.

16:34.579 --> 16:36.679
I need you to go! Now!

16:48.488 --> 16:51.756
I wish I could say I was
surprised to see you, son.

16:53.615 --> 16:55.341
You can put those down,

16:55.558 --> 16:57.133
I'll go peacefully.

16:57.163 --> 16:58.630
I'll leave the Outpost

16:58.665 --> 17:00.665
and I won't come back, I swear it.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.167
You had your chance to get out.

17:03.763 --> 17:05.136
And instead there's another body

17:05.171 --> 17:07.012
under your window.

17:10.343 --> 17:12.443
Put these on her,

17:12.479 --> 17:14.837
or she dies here and now.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.690
You're making a mistake.

17:29.778 --> 17:32.530
I might have said the same thing to you.

18:10.562 --> 18:12.428
Hold up.

18:13.778 --> 18:14.931
Stay there.

18:14.966 --> 18:16.548
Get over there.

18:16.693 --> 18:17.926
Be quiet.

18:18.499 --> 18:20.166
Hello, Cedric.

18:20.172 --> 18:21.791
It's been a long time.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.525
You're not welcome, Shek.

18:25.561 --> 18:28.328
I decide who comes through that gate.

18:28.363 --> 18:30.985
You and your band of
thugs can bugger off.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.533
You don't want to cross me today.

18:33.569 --> 18:34.801
Oh?

18:35.326 --> 18:37.904
And why is today any different?

18:37.940 --> 18:39.353
Because today,

18:39.540 --> 18:40.806
me and my...

18:41.095 --> 18:42.575
How did you put it?

18:42.581 --> 18:44.281
Band of thugs.

18:44.287 --> 18:46.566
Me and my esteemed companions

18:47.386 --> 18:50.373
are here as honorary ambassadors
of the Prime Order.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.045
Strictly Covenant business.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.597
And what business is so despicable

19:01.603 --> 19:04.571
that it requires your twisted skills?

19:06.099 --> 19:08.081
Do you know who killed Toru Magmoor?

19:10.982 --> 19:12.931
Yeah, I have a few leads.

19:13.609 --> 19:15.799
And how about that strange

19:15.805 --> 19:17.756
message you sent Everit Dred?

19:17.853 --> 19:19.085
"One remains."

19:19.091 --> 19:20.529
What of it?

19:25.318 --> 19:27.395
I'll make this easy on you.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.482
I'll be gone from your precious Outpost

19:30.488 --> 19:32.337
the moment you hand me a body

19:32.343 --> 19:34.128
that has dark pointed ears

19:34.134 --> 19:35.867
and black blood in its vein.

19:41.870 --> 19:43.970
[LAUGHING]

19:44.656 --> 19:46.222
Pointed ears?

19:46.633 --> 19:48.766
Black blood?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.276
I'd say you were joking,

19:50.282 --> 19:53.016
but I know your a
humorless, gutter snipe.

19:56.518 --> 19:58.854
"Tell Dred one remains."

19:58.860 --> 20:00.559
- You sent that.
- Aye.

20:00.978 --> 20:02.999
Those were Toru Magmoor's last words,

20:03.005 --> 20:04.938
written in his own red blood.

20:05.316 --> 20:08.750
There's no mention of black
blood or pointed ears.

20:09.159 --> 20:11.320
I want Toru's killer dead.

20:11.355 --> 20:12.816
As do I.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.488
And when that happens,

20:15.494 --> 20:17.961
the Prime Order will be
the first to hear about it.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.610
You've lost your touch, Wythers.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.386
You know, there was a time you'd

20:23.392 --> 20:25.077
your man within hours, not days.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.953
None of us are what we used to be.

20:31.069 --> 20:33.924
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a job to do.

20:50.358 --> 20:53.259
Why? Why didn't you just hand her over?

20:53.714 --> 20:57.496
I don't serve the Prime
Order any more than you do.

21:01.936 --> 21:04.036
[GRUNTS]

21:08.910 --> 21:10.892
Why are you doing this?

21:11.730 --> 21:15.132
Protect me from Shek so you
can murder me yourself?

21:15.316 --> 21:17.348
You should be thanking me.

21:17.858 --> 21:20.793
My way is quick and done.

21:21.077 --> 21:23.677
Their way they might
torture you for years

21:23.683 --> 21:25.816
before Dred lets you die.

21:26.094 --> 21:28.343
You'll be begging for your own death.

21:28.349 --> 21:30.316
Well, just let me kill him.

21:31.065 --> 21:33.032
Then you can have your way.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.630
Interesting.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.736
What's Shek to you?

21:36.771 --> 21:40.239
He and his men killed my family.

21:40.275 --> 21:42.208
It's tempting.

21:42.243 --> 21:44.425
Shek dead. You dead.

21:44.740 --> 21:47.741
But it leaves so many loose ends.

21:48.216 --> 21:51.811
I mean, Dred sent Magmoor to the Outpost

21:51.817 --> 21:53.684
and he gets killed.

21:54.322 --> 21:58.224
Then he sends Shek to the Outpost
and he's killed, too? No.

21:58.259 --> 22:00.532
Suddenly Dred and his Covenant agents

22:00.538 --> 22:02.566
are snooping all over the gaff.

22:02.597 --> 22:05.131
It'd be a right bloody mess.

22:05.166 --> 22:10.202
Or I turn over your dead body

22:10.238 --> 22:13.005
to Shek and say,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.941
"Look! I found your Blackblood.

22:15.977 --> 22:18.277
She's the one who killed Toru Magmoor."

22:19.278 --> 22:21.905
How many questions are
left unanswered then?

22:22.223 --> 22:23.608
None.

22:23.614 --> 22:25.580
They killed my family!

22:25.787 --> 22:27.520
My whole village.

22:30.825 --> 22:32.958

What the hell are you?

Garret...

24:08.222 --> 24:10.356
GARRET: All those murders?

24:10.391 --> 24:11.735
Was that you?

24:11.741 --> 24:13.826
You and... and... and that thing?

24:13.861 --> 24:15.452
I can't control it.

24:15.458 --> 24:18.069
If I could, I would never have
let it hurt those people.

24:18.075 --> 24:20.533
But it just now obeyed you.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.334
I've been learning.

24:22.370 --> 24:23.869
It's the first time it's done that.

24:23.905 --> 24:25.291
I think because I spoke

24:25.297 --> 24:27.297
in my ancestral language.

24:30.626 --> 24:32.399
So what now?

24:34.749 --> 24:36.215
I need a minute.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.324
The black blood.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.027
Is that why you can control it?

24:48.062 --> 24:50.029
Something like that.

24:52.279 --> 24:55.013
That's why the Prime
Order want you so badly.

24:58.506 --> 25:00.439
You have to let me go.

25:00.475 --> 25:01.941
Why should I?

25:01.976 --> 25:03.864
Because I'm the only
one who has any chance

25:03.870 --> 25:05.411
to rid us of this thing.

"One remains."

25:16.215 --> 25:17.764

25:20.286 --> 25:21.927
It's me.

I chased it into the sewers.

26:41.073 --> 26:42.581
Only after I fought it.

26:42.617 --> 26:44.150
And lost.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.186
Instead of just finishing me
off, it just left me there.

26:47.221 --> 26:48.707
It knows.

It knows you're the only
hope for its kindred.

saved me from my execution.

bend you to its will.

never open that door again.

I was about to die when
it listened to me.

27:15.082 --> 27:16.850
How is that without fear?

27:17.725 --> 27:21.397
Maybe you thought you were going to die

27:21.762 --> 27:24.363
so you had nothing to lose,

27:24.398 --> 27:26.365
you were past the point of fear.

27:26.992 --> 27:28.851
Kind of splitting hairs, aren't you?

27:28.857 --> 27:31.548
Now you must command it
back through the portal.

27:31.939 --> 27:35.438
Yeah, that's the bit you didn't explain.

Neither do I.

27:44.739 --> 27:46.472
What do you mean?

27:46.478 --> 27:48.594
Your ancestors lived in fear

27:48.611 --> 27:50.311
that the power would
used for destruction.

27:50.346 --> 27:52.446
So they took great pains
to hide any information

27:52.482 --> 27:55.792

piece of the puzzle.

27:56.269 --> 27:58.986

you can tell me about it.

Only this...

28:02.592 --> 28:06.093
All Blackbloods have the
power to control demons.

28:06.129 --> 28:07.968
But only one at any time

28:07.974 --> 28:10.241
can open the passageway to their world.

28:10.276 --> 28:13.711
And that power is handed
down from father to son,

28:14.089 --> 28:16.223
from mother to daughter.

28:20.719 --> 28:22.157
My mother.

28:23.256 --> 28:25.763
Before she died, she touched me.

28:25.935 --> 28:27.735
And I felt something happen.

28:27.741 --> 28:29.541
Sounds like you already understand more

28:29.547 --> 28:31.380
than I could ever teach you.

28:41.407 --> 28:44.375
Come back when the Lu-Qiri is gone.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.377
I have a surprise for you.

28:46.412 --> 28:49.547
And we can sit and discuss
the ways of your people.

29:12.705 --> 29:14.082
What?

29:15.775 --> 29:17.608
Why didn't you tell me?

29:18.276 --> 29:19.933
About what you are.

29:21.288 --> 29:23.055
'Cause I'm still the same person.

29:23.061 --> 29:25.241
You're not, though, are you?

29:27.420 --> 29:29.353
I mean, after everything

29:29.388 --> 29:31.023
I've done to help you,

29:31.271 --> 29:32.862
you should have told me.

29:32.868 --> 29:34.066
Why?

29:35.272 --> 29:36.728
Now you know the real me,

29:36.734 --> 29:38.233
- I disgust you?
- No!

29:38.264 --> 29:40.988
Look, I don't know what to think.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.526
All right, you control this creature.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.360
This thing that is killing people.

29:46.366 --> 29:49.867
- People I am responsible for...
- I do not control it!

29:52.352 --> 29:53.744
Did you tell Gwynn?

29:54.184 --> 29:55.203
Yeah.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.370
I told her that Wythers let you go.

29:59.376 --> 30:01.877
But I didn't tell her how it happened.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.851
Did she tell you why she turned on me?

30:05.403 --> 30:07.236
Why suddenly she was all too happy

30:07.242 --> 30:09.442
to let the marshal cut off my head?

30:11.112 --> 30:12.900
All I can tell you is that

30:14.189 --> 30:16.633
she didn't have much of a choice.

30:16.639 --> 30:18.372
No, I get it.

30:18.668 --> 30:20.390
She was saving her own skin.

30:23.048 --> 30:25.363
GARRET: What are they doing?

30:27.394 --> 30:28.760
Checking ears.

30:29.048 --> 30:31.448
Those are the Bones.

30:31.484 --> 30:32.712
Aren't they?

30:33.322 --> 30:35.584
The men who killed your family.

30:37.356 --> 30:38.756
So, first the Bones,

30:38.791 --> 30:40.591
then the creature. That's your plan?

30:41.799 --> 30:43.361
Shouldn't your first priority

30:43.367 --> 30:45.031
be getting rid of that thing?

30:45.037 --> 30:46.296
It's called a Lu-Qiri.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.334
Fine.

30:47.340 --> 30:50.688
Shouldn't stopping the
Lu-Qiri take precedence

30:50.694 --> 30:52.227
over getting revenge?

30:55.008 --> 30:57.708
All my life, I have
searched for those men.

30:58.589 --> 31:00.944
I can't really explain it, it's just...

31:01.647 --> 31:04.548
I feel as though I'll never be
able to control the Lu-Qiri

31:04.583 --> 31:07.225
until I clear my mind
of everything else.

31:09.153 --> 31:11.320
Until I can put my past behind me.

31:12.992 --> 31:15.109
If it makes you feel any better,

31:16.531 --> 31:19.663
I'm hoping to solve
both problems at once.

31:21.269 --> 31:24.535
Well, if you ask me, I think
you're being selfish,

31:24.570 --> 31:27.237
and completely suicidal.

31:29.029 --> 31:31.296
And for what it's worth,

31:31.526 --> 31:34.994
I would at least rather you
not do the suicide part.

31:59.123 --> 32:01.970
I knew one day you'd show up at my door.

32:03.470 --> 32:06.176
Good to see you again, old Wolf.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.408
And you left us for this?

32:09.354 --> 32:11.915
What's worth more than peace of mind?

32:12.795 --> 32:14.336
I don't know.

32:14.342 --> 32:15.892
A good horse?

32:16.931 --> 32:19.289
A pair of boots?

32:22.161 --> 32:24.100
You must know why I'm here.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.074
First Magmoor, now you.

32:27.829 --> 32:29.602
Maybe we're having a reunion?

32:31.118 --> 32:32.840
Where's the Blackblood?

32:34.320 --> 32:35.850
Blackblood?

32:36.308 --> 32:37.741
If that's what you've come to find,

32:37.777 --> 32:39.120
you've come a long way for nothing.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.911
Yes. It was a long ride

32:40.946 --> 32:43.389
out to this armpit of the Realm.

32:44.016 --> 32:46.083
Gave me lot of time to think.

32:46.118 --> 32:47.623
"One remains."

32:48.507 --> 32:49.907
How is that even possible?

32:49.913 --> 32:51.713
We killed them all.

32:52.224 --> 32:54.205
And then I remembered.

32:55.283 --> 32:57.394
The girl in the tomb.

32:57.429 --> 32:59.730
My arrows never miss.

32:59.765 --> 33:02.966
Now, that's precisely
what I told myself.

33:04.660 --> 33:06.560
Unless you aim to miss.

33:07.072 --> 33:10.274
Now why would you do that, I wonder?

33:11.191 --> 33:13.577
There's something about her, Shek.

33:14.151 --> 33:16.352
It's bigger than you or me.

33:17.216 --> 33:19.249
I tried to kill her once, but I failed.

33:19.285 --> 33:20.490
And so will you.

33:20.496 --> 33:22.345
That's not her destiny.

33:23.482 --> 33:26.256
Spoken like a man who's lost his touch.

33:26.292 --> 33:27.933
And also his mind.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.761
Leave and be done with it, Shek.

33:30.796 --> 33:34.118
There are forces at work here
you will never understand.

33:34.124 --> 33:37.267
I kill whatever, whenever I please.

33:38.321 --> 33:42.005
There's no destiny
here, there's no Gods.

33:43.037 --> 33:46.109
There's only strength and weakness.

33:46.145 --> 33:49.773
Today I'm one, and you're the other.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.452
I will not fight you, Shek.

33:55.487 --> 33:57.254
Kill me if you must,

33:57.289 --> 33:59.223
but there'll be no sport in it for you.

33:59.258 --> 34:00.575
Sport?

34:02.239 --> 34:04.274
This is vengeance.

34:04.451 --> 34:06.384
You should never have turned

34:06.390 --> 34:08.014
your back on me, old Wolf.

34:08.021 --> 34:09.889
The Wolf died that day,

34:09.896 --> 34:11.666
in the Blackblood village.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.571
The Smith will die today,

34:14.607 --> 34:16.887
happy to have done some
good in this life.

34:16.893 --> 34:18.289
Oh?

34:18.295 --> 34:20.362
And what good have you done?

34:22.246 --> 34:24.279
One remains.

34:25.382 --> 34:26.917
Not for long.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.654
[GASPS]

34:33.958 --> 34:36.994
- [GROANS]
- Before she dies,

34:37.029 --> 34:40.422
I'm going to enjoy telling
her what you really are.

34:41.433 --> 34:43.400
[GASPS]

34:52.244 --> 34:55.379
[GASPS]

35:18.296 --> 35:20.196
This is for the Blackbloods.

[YELLS]

36:18.422 --> 36:21.223
[GASPS]

37:02.566 --> 37:04.399
This way.

37:08.305 --> 37:09.938
SHEK: Guide us all.

37:09.974 --> 37:12.107
BONES 2: To the right.

37:18.616 --> 37:20.749
SHEK: Stay quiet!

37:57.054 --> 37:58.854
[SCREAMS]

[GRUNTS]

39:21.071 --> 39:23.238
[GROANS]

39:23.498 --> 39:25.165
So Dred was right.

39:25.171 --> 39:27.493
You Blackbloods can
control these monsters.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.334
I just thought he was
a religious nutter.

39:31.580 --> 39:34.074
We did some good eradicating your kind.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.518
[GRUNTS]

39:41.558 --> 39:43.467
What? You can't win in a fair fight?

39:43.473 --> 39:45.060
You need your beast to do it for you?

39:45.095 --> 39:46.495
Fair fight?

39:46.530 --> 39:48.895
You murdered unarmed
peasants and children!

39:48.901 --> 39:51.333
I spilled a lot of black
blood that night,

39:51.618 --> 39:53.551
but not as much as your friend the Wolf.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.271
Magmoor said that name, too.

39:56.710 --> 39:58.677
Who is this Wolf?

39:58.683 --> 39:59.975
[LAUGHS]

40:00.010 --> 40:02.113
You don't know?

40:02.119 --> 40:03.720
It's that Blacksmith you've been

40:03.726 --> 40:05.170
spending so much time with.

40:05.176 --> 40:06.284
No.

40:06.945 --> 40:10.419
Yeah, his arrows killed so
many Blackbloods that night.

40:10.454 --> 40:12.587
[GRUNTS]

40:15.753 --> 40:17.225
Arrows.

40:26.970 --> 40:29.137
[GROANS]

40:32.402 --> 40:34.600
So really it's him you should
be seeking revenge on,

40:34.606 --> 40:36.572
wouldn't you say?

40:37.169 --> 40:39.170
They were your men.

40:39.176 --> 40:40.467
You were the leader.

40:40.473 --> 40:41.672
Was I?

40:42.730 --> 40:45.042
If a sword kills your people,

40:45.048 --> 40:47.115
do you find and destroy the sword?

40:47.150 --> 40:50.452
No, I destroy the man.

40:50.487 --> 40:52.011
I'm just a sword.

40:52.142 --> 40:54.909
A cold piece of steel in
the hands of Everit Dred,

40:55.259 --> 40:57.525
If not me, he would
have paid someone else.

40:57.561 --> 41:00.295
So you see, even if you defeat me,

41:00.330 --> 41:01.696
which you won't,

41:01.732 --> 41:04.833
you'll have destroyed
nothing but a sword,

41:04.868 --> 41:07.969
while the true killer goes free.

41:14.912 --> 41:17.312
[GRUNTS]

41:21.618 --> 41:24.452
Your ugly friend's worried about you.

41:28.792 --> 41:30.262
