02:22.120 --> 02:24.111
Griff, what's with
all the stampeding women?

02:24.360 --> 02:27.158
Well, either Enoch the janitor's
dancing bottomless again...

02:27.360 --> 02:30.397
...or Babcock Shoes is having
another sale.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.755
l don't get it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.912
l've been working in the same mall
with Babcock for 20 years.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.549
What does his shoe store have
that this one doesn't?

02:40.960 --> 02:44.839
-Do you have any black pumps?
-Nope, never carry them.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.514
Then l'm going to Babcock's.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.672
Why does Floyd's business
do better?

02:50.920 --> 02:52.717
You know, Griff, l think it's location.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.196
l doubt it. Babcock's is between
World of Carbuncles...

02:56.400 --> 02:58.789
...and House of Floss.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.039
Well, whatever it is,
just once l'd like to beat him.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.510
Griff, l'm gonna
have to do something crafty.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.990
Maybe you could slip him
a stick of dynamite...

03:08.240 --> 03:11.437
...cleverly disguised
as a Cuban cigar.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.315
You idiot. Where am l gonna get
a Cuban cigar?

03:18.720 --> 03:23.635
Griff, is it me or is there the smell
of Old Spice and bacon in the air?

03:24.760 --> 03:28.196
-Hello, Babcock.
-Bundy, glad you're here.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.989
Though, if you weren't,
sales might improve.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.474
lt's so busy at my store...

03:33.680 --> 03:37.195
...that my son here, Little Floyd,
can't study.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.193
lf you're looking for peace and quiet,
don't take him home...

03:40.400 --> 03:43.836
...where the Chicago Bulls
are practicing lay-ups with your wife.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.160
An adultery joke. You see, Bundy...

03:50.360 --> 03:53.352
...that doesn't work on a guy
with two beautiful mistresses.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.672
-You didn't hear that.
-Yes, Dad.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.235
Come on, Babcock.
You didn't bring your boy--

03:59.480 --> 04:02.790
Who suspiciously looks
like Dennis Rodman.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.790
--you didn't bring him down here
just to study.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.190
You're right.
This is more of a life lesson.

04:08.440 --> 04:14.788
You see, my son, Little Floyd,
and your son, Little Nobody...

04:15.040 --> 04:18.350
...are in the same Entrepreneurial
Studies class at Trumaine.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.875
And we both have to come up with
a product and a marketing campaign.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.594
And you brought Little Dweeb-o here
to the mall...

04:28.560 --> 04:30.551
...to see how real businesses work?

04:30.800 --> 04:35.476
Yes, and to your store
to see how they don't work.

04:35.720 --> 04:39.679
So you see, son, when you create
your marketing product...

04:39.920 --> 04:43.151
...what are you not going to do?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.879
Don't worry, Bundy, you'll beat me
at something someday, maybe.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.877
Just kidding.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.712
Your wife's uglier than my wife.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.713
-Oh, good one, Al.
-That's it.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.192
lf l can't beat Babcock in business,
l'll beat him where it hurts.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.749
ln the nads?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.550
Close. His son.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.117
Great. l'll keep the car running...

05:15.320 --> 05:18.198
...while you hit that little guy
with a bag of oranges.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.238
That's what they expect me to do.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.079
No. l'll get my revenge...

05:24.280 --> 05:27.875
...when Bud beats Little Floyd
in his marketing project.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.112
Bud's product, whatever it is...

05:31.320 --> 05:33.834
...will be pure genius.

05:34.040 --> 05:39.114
And now,
the Bundy hands-free page-turner.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.638
This is what you're planning
on marketing?

06:00.400 --> 06:03.551
l don't know why l let you put yourself
through college.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.437
Son, don't you understand?
This project is very important?

06:07.680 --> 06:09.955
l didn't know you cared so much
about my education.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.111
Well, l don't.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.516
This is about me and Floyd Babcock.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.075
See, l've never been able
to beat him in business.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.116
Yeah, so order some nice shoes
and have a sale.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.752
Why would l work that hard
when l have you?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.918
See, Bud, his son and you
are in the same class.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.755
Now, all you have to do is get a
higher grade than him on this project...

06:31.960 --> 06:33.996
...and l'll have my revenge.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.351
See, this is exactly
why l didn't play Little League.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.593
No, son, you didn't play Little League,
because you threw like a girl.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.152
What sells in the '90s...

06:47.360 --> 06:50.193
...is the same thing that has sold
since the beginning of time.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.317
-What, shoes?
-Well, sure, of course.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.398
That's why we're living here
in the lap of luxury.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.672
Bud, l'm talking about sex.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.674
So, what, you want me
to become a pimp?

07:04.760 --> 07:07.911
No, you'd have to be able
to protect your girls for that.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.629
Well, what then, Dad?

07:10.880 --> 07:14.839
Why do l have to think of everything?
You're supposed to be the smart one.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.431
-Hello.
-Hi, Al.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.835
-Peg?
-Yeah, it's me.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.991
l'm just on my way out to find Dad.

07:23.720 --> 07:27.349
Well, when did you leave?

07:29.760 --> 07:30.715
Yesterday.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.798
Well, no wonder the sex was good
last night.

07:35.400 --> 07:39.109
Oh, but don't worry, Al,
l'll be home just as soon as l find Dad.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.239
And believe me,
l am leaving no stone unturned.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.756
-Where are you?
-Well, l just left Tiffany's.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.549
You wouldn't believe how big
some of their stones are.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.716
You ought to see some of mine.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.398
l just felt a big one leave my kidneys
and head for my urinary tract.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.075
Now, look, Peg...

07:59.280 --> 08:02.909
...don't go using this trip as an excuse
to spend all my money.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.749
Al, l am trying to save
my parents' marriage.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.600
This is not about you
and your stupid money.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.758
Now, look, l gotta go.
l'll call you later.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.629
-That was Mom?
-Yeah.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.672
Yeah, she left us.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.390
-Mom's gone?
-Yeah.

08:25.360 --> 08:29.069
-Was it something l did?
-l don't know.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.758
Maybe.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.037
But, look, Bud, the important thing...

08:35.240 --> 08:37.799
...is that you come up with a good idea
for this project.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.594
One that'll beat Little Floyd.
Son, you're my last chance.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.188
My children are my only hope.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.356
Hey, you guys.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.715
My new calendar came in.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.037
The Buns of '' USC.''

08:55.360 --> 08:57.999
Looks like it's just down to you, son.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.710
Oh, my God, look at these buns.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.713
Oh, l knew l should have gone
to '' USC.''

09:06.000 --> 09:11.632
Kelly, l think you just '' imbeciled''
onto a great idea.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.356
What, sending me to '' USC''?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.588
No. Making a calendar like this
for Trumaine.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.872
You wanna make a calendar
of men's butts?

09:21.120 --> 09:24.635
No. l'm talking about doing a calendar
of the girls of Trumaine.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.350
See, all l'll need is a camera
and 1 2 beautiful women.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.879
Well, let's see.

09:30.120 --> 09:34.511
You have your Lieutenant Uhura doll.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.596
Barbie.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.918
lsis.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.276
Strawberry Shortcake.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.674
Oh, and that little pink sock
you put on your hand and call Missy.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.596
Yeah, go ahead and scoff now, Kel.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.549
But if l put out a casting call
and say l'm making movies for HBO...

09:55.760 --> 09:57.113
...beautiful women will come.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.272
Oh, yes, they will come.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.678
Oh, cool.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.718
Page-turner for my calendar.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.150
That-- That was great.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.233
-That was the best shoot of the day.
-Thanks, bud.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.317
l was a little nervous
about doing this...

10:54.520 --> 10:58.479
...because, well, all my friends say
you're a perverted horndog.

10:58.680 --> 11:03.071
-But you're really not.
-Oh, well, thanks.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.237
By the way, did you drop
your contact lens on the floor there?

11:07.440 --> 11:11.069
l thought l saw your....

11:20.280 --> 11:21.838
Hey, Bud.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.838
Move, you're blocking my shot.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.553
lt's okay, Jefferson.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.433
l've got her covered from here.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.153
Oh, man.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.873
Hold it right there.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.793
Well, l believe that we now
have photographed...

11:57.000 --> 12:00.037
...the back of every shoebox
in Chicago.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.832
Just as we intended...

12:03.080 --> 12:06.390
...for that coffee-table book
of shoebox backs.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.039
Well, to the Fotomat.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.071
Run.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.639
What is it?
Al, l'm trying to run a business.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.871
But you wouldn't know
anything about that.

12:23.040 --> 12:27.397
Yeah, like l wouldn't know about you
trying on women's shoes after closing.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.315
You didn't hear that.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.114
Babcock, l just brought you here
to show my genius son...

12:34.360 --> 12:36.237
...and what his class project is.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.591
lt's the calendar of the girls
of Trumaine. She's Miss November.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.399
lt's not bad, Bundy,
but l'm sure my son can top that.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.269
-What's your project Little Floyd?
-Okay.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.629
l've invented a printer...

12:49.840 --> 12:53.628
...that is simultaneously compatible
with both lBMs and Macintoshes.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.872
lt'll revolutionize
the computer industry.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.840
You win, Bundy.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.396
How dare you take my name,
Little Floyd?

13:11.640 --> 13:16.555
From this moment forth,
l shall refer to you only as Little.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.519
That's funny,
that's how Mom refers to you.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.475
You didn't hear that.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.791
Damned if l didn't.

13:32.560 --> 13:37.429
Hey, l just remembered something.
l don't wear contact lenses.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.910
l'll see you
in Astrophysics tomorrow, Bud.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.315
l'll be right behind you.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.839
You guys think she's great?

13:51.080 --> 13:54.231
l've got Crystal Clark
to be on the cover of my calendar.

13:54.440 --> 13:58.433
-You got Crystal Clark?
-Who's Crystal Clark?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.157
Right here.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.470
Al, l've got an idea.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.635
Divorce our wives...

14:05.840 --> 14:08.195
...and move to Saudi Arabia
so we can marry Crystal?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.072
No.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.952
Yes.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.112
But first, l propose we talk
to a publisher friend of mine.

14:15.360 --> 14:19.069
We can take this calendar national,
make ourselves a fortune.

14:19.320 --> 14:23.154
-But we still marry Crystal?
-Oh, sure, sure.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.828
Well, how much are you willing
to invest?

14:26.360 --> 14:27.475
Ten thou.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.638
Great. l'll throw in 1 0 too.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.714
So we'll have $20,000.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.072
No, we'll have $1 0,01 0.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.835
Oh, it was my son Bud's idea.
l want half.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.355
Forget it. Look, Bundy,
l'm taking all the risk.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.558
l mean, what if
this is a touched-up picture?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.678
-Hi, Crystal.
-Hi, Bud.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.831
Well, l'm touched.

14:54.680 --> 14:58.639
And l'm up.
Let's go fax this to the publisher.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.591
So are you ready
for your photo shoot?

15:02.800 --> 15:05.951
Sure. Who were those two
drooling geezers with Little Floyd?

15:06.720 --> 15:09.598
Those-- Those were our fathers.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.516
That was Big Floyd and Big Void.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.238
Crystal, remember how l said
this was gonna be a class project?

15:18.480 --> 15:21.870
Well, l've got great news.
We are going national.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.516
This is gonna be sold coast-to-coast
and all you can say is, ''Oh''?

15:29.720 --> 15:34.157
l can also say l'm sorry, Bud,
l can't pose for your calendar anymore.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.392
What do you mean
she doesn't wanna do it?

15:38.600 --> 15:42.912
Don't you know how much money
l've got riding on this calendar?

15:43.120 --> 15:46.954
-Oh, yeah, l know. You had $1 0, Dad.
-That's beside the point.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.033
Don't you realize how many
hundreds of thousands of dollars...

15:50.280 --> 15:52.510
...that $1 0 was going to earn?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.075
You were gonna share how much
of that money with me?

15:55.280 --> 15:58.033
Again we deviate from the point.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.676
Look, Dad, l got her to come over.
l'll talk her into it, okay?

16:02.920 --> 16:06.708
You better,
or l'm cutting you out of the will.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.030
Wait a minute, that's no punishment.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.753
l'm putting you in the will.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.430
You'll owe millions.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.678
Hi, Dad.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.878
Kelly, l don't get it.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.112
Why would Crystal not wanna be
in a national calendar?

16:29.360 --> 16:33.956
l mean, if someone asked me
to pose in Speedos, l'd do it.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.391
Gee, Bud, thanks for the visual.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.512
Kelly, please help me.
Crystal's gonna be here any second.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.598
l have no idea how l'm gonna
convince her to be in my calendar.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.553
Well, why don't you try
being sincere?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.991
What, you mean
like completely honest?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.912
That goes against everything
l stand for.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.270
That'd almost be like talking
to a guy.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.151
Well, that's exactly how she'll feel.
Anyway, l'm gonna go upstairs...

17:02.360 --> 17:06.876
...and finish reading my calendar
of the Buns of '' UCLA.''

17:11.079 --> 17:15.153
-Hey, Bud. You wanted to see me?
-Yeah, Crystal.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.949
l wanted to be sincere with you about
this calendar and what it means to me.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.679
Okay.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.712
Crystal...

17:28.400 --> 17:32.393
...l don't talk about my brother much.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.717
But, well, Judd and l...

17:40.800 --> 17:44.156
...we were born Siamese twins.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.631
We shared everything.
Well, we had to.

17:49.280 --> 17:54.229
And then came that awful day
when we had to go our separate ways.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.471
l went to school...

17:56.680 --> 17:59.990
...and Judd went into a Mason jar.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.077
We don't expect him
to live very long.

18:05.320 --> 18:10.599
l mean, he's not much more
than an eye and a foot and some hair.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.471
But you see,
l made him this solemn promise...

18:16.680 --> 18:18.432
...that l would make him a calendar...

18:18.640 --> 18:21.552
...of the best damn good-looking girls
at Trumaine.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.268
So, Crystal,
if you can't do this for me...

18:24.520 --> 18:29.514
...just do it for that little lost boy
in the Mason jar.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.348
What do you say?

18:34.920 --> 18:36.956
Okay.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.950
The truth is, l really need you
to pose for this calendar...

18:43.160 --> 18:44.752
...because without you,
it's nothing.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.439
l'm sorry, Bud. l just can't pose
for a national calendar.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.676
l mean, what if my parents saw me?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.678
Yeah, but it's not like
you're gonna be nude or anything.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.714
-Well, what would l be wearing?
-This.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.148
-That?
-Yeah, yeah, it's a large.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.394
l'm sorry, Bud, l just can't.
You don't understand.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.870
Oh, Crystal, please, please.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.157
Look, you've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.470
l mean, you got a great body.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.915
And don't worry
about what your parents think.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.674
Parents love their children
no matter what they do.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.195
Damn you, Kelly!

19:26.080 --> 19:29.038
You ate my last Hershey's Kiss!

19:29.720 --> 19:33.110
-You're in the will!
-No, Dad, no!

19:35.560 --> 19:38.279
Crystal, please.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.353
You are the most beautiful woman
l've ever seen.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.160
And l'm not just talking
on the outside.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.868
l mean, you should be proud
of who you are.

19:49.080 --> 19:53.870
You know, maybe doing this calendar
isn't such a bad idea after all.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.193
l'll let my parents know
l've finally become a woman.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.279
Thank you, Bud.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.277
You don't know how much
this means to me.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.550
And you don't know how much
that meant to me.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.988
Yes.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.599
Oh, man.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.154
ls Crystal wearing
really, really short cutoff jeans...

20:29.400 --> 20:32.472
...or does she just have
stonewashed skin?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.830
lt doesn't matter.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.473
Hey, Floyd, next time, let's do
the 1 2 Months of Crystal calendar.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.712
All Crystal, all the time.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.599
l think l can dig up about 5 bucks.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.319
Dad, guess what.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.711
l got an A-plus on my project.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.353
l knew you wouldn't let me down,
son.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.639
-How'd you do, Little Floyd?
-l got an A.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.189
Come on over here, son.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.317
Not you.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.751
Our son, mine and Al's.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.477
Hey, guess what.
There's more great news.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.473
Crystal's going on Chicago Live
to publicize the calendar.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.513
Floyd, can you say:

21:25.280 --> 21:27.919
Oh, l'm telling you, Dads...

21:28.120 --> 21:31.999
...she is so hot,
l think l'm gonna ask her out tonight.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.596
You can marry her with me and Floyd
for all l care.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.150
As long as she keeps making
these calendars, she's family.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.794
Hey. Hey, guys, be quiet.
Chicago Live is on.

21:42.040 --> 21:46.192
Now, Crystal, what made you decide
to do a calendar lik e this?

21:46.440 --> 21:49.000
A wonderful man named Bud Bundy.

21:49.240 --> 21:53.028
With his kind words, he convinced me
that l have nothing to be ashamed of.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.431
And he's quite the kisser.

21:58.360 --> 22:03.753
Yes! Everyone knows l kissed her.
l am a god.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.349
Now, Crystal...

22:06.560 --> 22:09.313
...you said there's something
you wanted to tell the world...

22:09.520 --> 22:11.590
... live on our show.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.195
She's gonna propose to me.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.510
l do.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.119
Yes.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.995
lt's time for my family
and the rest of the world...

22:22.200 --> 22:24.236
...to see the person l've become.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.313
Bud Bundy has made me proud
to be a woman...

22:27.560 --> 22:30.632
... who was born a man.
