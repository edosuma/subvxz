Oh, it's finely made.

02:19.020 --> 02:23.060
It's a...a timepiece, Pedro.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.260
It's called a pocket dial.

02:25.340 --> 02:29.900
But how can it tell the time?
Well, there's a part missing.

02:29.980 --> 02:33.260
A band that travels around it,
and the ring itself is

02:33.340 --> 02:36.180

Hey, can you fix it?

The doctor says
until your back is mended.

aiming to come and see me,
I refuse it.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.780
If you found it, Pedro,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.620
then a simple twist of fate
declares that it is yours.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
But, sir, is it not valuable?

You truly wish to give it to me?

05:02.340 --> 05:04.300
I have other questions first, sir.

in your wine?

There is no advantage
to me in that gambit.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.420
It was not fit well with itself.
And I thought it to be true.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.380
It seems we live
in times without trust.

kept an advantage.

the balance of things.

Pedro and Maria to his child
in his will.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.820
Who will stop this vulture?

37:06.900 --> 37:08.900
I will.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Ugh, soup?

37:19.740 --> 37:21.740
How long have I been here?

37:21.820 --> 37:23.780
You are here today, sir.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.980
(SIGHS)
See what my mistress gave to me.

37:31.740 --> 37:34.100
It's a timepiece.

37:34.180 --> 37:36.780
I don't know how it works,
but it has time in it.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.700
It tells you of the time
when you look into it.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.740
Could it serve our wits,

37:45.380 --> 37:47.380
twist away all them years?

37:47.460 --> 37:49.420
(POIGNANT MUSIC)

37:51.540 --> 37:53.540
You might keep it, sir.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.940
Soup.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.340
(SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN)

(SNORES)

39:23.620 --> 39:25.620
(FLOORBOARD CREAKS)

39:27.100 --> 39:30.500
Governor, my ancestors have
returned.

39:30.580 --> 39:33.940
They asked me
to speak with you, Governor.

39:34.020 --> 39:36.780
There is wickedness about.

39:36.860 --> 39:40.940
(INHALES)
The night is foul with dangers.

39:42.140 --> 39:46.420
A rock or a word
might dash your brains out.

39:48.660 --> 39:50.660
Do not sleep,

39:50.740 --> 39:53.980
for your dreams will abuse you.

39:54.060 --> 39:58.260
The moon will catch
your secret thoughts

39:58.340 --> 40:00.300
and prison them forever.

40:01.380 --> 40:04.220
Wake, sir.

40:04.300 --> 40:07.340
For safety's sake, wake.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.340
Wake.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.900
(PANTING)

40:17.540 --> 40:19.540
Meredith?

40:19.620 --> 40:22.660
(SNORING)
Meredith!

40:22.740 --> 40:24.700
The mariners that stole
from the treasurer

40:24.780 --> 40:26.740
and vanished into Virginia,

40:26.820 --> 40:28.900
Verity says you were told
where they went to.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.780
How do you know
when it is all too late?

40:36.900 --> 40:38.900
Meredith, where did they go?

40:41.460 --> 40:43.460
Gloaming Creek.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.140
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC)

41:05.060 --> 41:07.300
I will go upriver
to seek out the mariners.

41:08.660 --> 41:12.340
I will go alone.
You're too late, sir.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.380
The mission is already taken up.

41:15.420 --> 41:17.420
Who?

41:33.060 --> 41:35.260
James, I'm coming with you.

41:35.340 --> 41:37.820
Gloaming Creek is where I heard
tell Tam was headed to.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.620
No. It is a month upriver.
You are not coming.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.860
I will seek out the boy.
Oh, sure you will (!)

41:42.940 --> 41:45.900
Look, I may not care
for the lad, but I care for you.

41:45.980 --> 41:48.980
So, if I get to Gloaming Creek,
then I will look for him.

41:49.060 --> 41:52.860
James, if I don't go with you now
and I never hear of that lad more,

41:52.940 --> 41:56.540
I will be as ruined
and as tormented as Meredith is.

41:56.620 --> 41:59.340
Would you do that to me,
would you?

41:59.420 --> 42:01.380
Be a true friend to me, James.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
Be a true friend, won't ya?

42:09.300 --> 42:11.300
Damn you, woman.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.020
Where is Pedro?

42:19.100 --> 42:21.820
The Widow Castell asked him
to accompany her

42:21.900 --> 42:23.980
to prospect new land
along the river.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.220
I protested that she has
her own men. She said -

42:26.300 --> 42:28.540
It was my ancestors.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.660
I told Lady Yeardley
they had bid Pedro

42:32.740 --> 42:35.140
to go up the river
with Mistress Castell, sir.

42:36.900 --> 42:40.380
They told me that
the moons will come and go, sir.

42:40.460 --> 42:44.620
The leaves will fall, and Pedro
will carry news back to you.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.940
He will return with word
of the thick, cunning threats

42:48.020 --> 42:50.180
that you must beware yourself of.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.780
It is as it must be, sir.

42:57.420 --> 43:00.220
We cannot defy my ancestors.

43:02.220 --> 43:04.220
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

43:30.460 --> 43:33.420
The cage, Master Crabtree,
will be placed upon your flesh.

43:33.500 --> 43:36.780
I know the business well
enough, sir (!) VERITY: Jocelyn!

43:36.860 --> 43:39.580
If you spend your time
comforting her, she will die.

43:39.660 --> 43:43.540
No-one will know how I will be
when I meet these serpents!

43:44.180 --> 43:48.100
TEMPERANCE: When you fall,
you will fall like Lucifer,

43:48.180 --> 43:50.620
