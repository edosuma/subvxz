WEBVTT

01:52.612 --> 01:54.114
Aunt Zelda? Ambrose?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.283
Cousin, what was that?
It sounded like--

01:57.367 --> 01:58.451
Aunt Zee?

02:01.955 --> 02:02.997
Aunt Zelda!

02:03.081 --> 02:05.166
-Ambrose!
-Oh, sweet Satan.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.211
Aunt Zelda! Aunt Zelda! Can you hear me?

02:09.295 --> 02:10.672
Aunt Zelda?

02:11.172 --> 02:12.006
Aunt Zelda?

02:13.424 --> 02:16.553
-Ambrose, she barely has a pulse.
-Stay with her. We need help.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.766
Aunt Zelda? Can you hear me?
Stay with me, okay?

02:21.850 --> 02:25.812
I'm not done driving you crazy yet.
Just... just hold on, okay?

02:25.895 --> 02:28.106
Just hold on. Help is coming.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.316
Cousin! I've brought reinforcements.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.071
The bleeding won't stop,
and her heartbeat's so faint.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.157
It'll be all right.
Mambo Marie said she can help.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.408
I will try, <i>chéries.</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:41.786
Where in this house can we operate?

02:43.037 --> 02:44.330
Downstairs.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
Here it is.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.926
Is there something more
that we could be doing, Mambo?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.845
I am afraid not.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.016
If we are going to save Zelda's life,
she will need great strength.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.352
You three, you have no strength to give.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.776
There is life here,

03:13.860 --> 03:17.572
but she is lost between the land
of the dead and the living.

03:18.406 --> 03:23.745
Her <i>esprit</i> has wandered deep
into the "in-between,"

03:24.704 --> 03:26.497
the Nether Realm of the Gede Lwa.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.916
So what, she's in Limbo?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.918
Different words for the same place.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.046
Now we wait.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.757
And we burn the violet candles.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.885
For that is the best way
to lead Zelda back to us,

03:39.552 --> 03:41.804
here, in this life.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.392
Oh, no! What is that?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.685
Go. See.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.978
You three.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.396
I can take care of Zelda here.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.525
But whatever it is,
do not let it enter this house.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.152
Go!

04:04.285 --> 04:05.495
That is a banshee.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.413
Also known as a wailing woman.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.165
Why is she here?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.833
It's an omen, Sabrina.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.878
I'm sorry, but a member
of the Spellman Family

04:13.962 --> 04:15.380
is going to die soon.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.216
Maybe more than one.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.802
No, Prudence.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.556
I don't care what she is.
No one in this house is dying.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.120
Yes.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.746
Much better.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.958
And now, Lilith,

04:53.042 --> 04:54.168
your reward.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.801
You separated me from that buffoon,
Blackwood.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.471
As you requested, my liege.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.182
You know what comes next, don't you?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.727
That's why
you haven't even bothered to run.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.358
You kill me for the part I played
in overthrowing you.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.484
Yes, except...

05:19.777 --> 05:23.156
a lot has changed
since your little nap in the tub.

05:23.948 --> 05:24.824
Blackwood's gone.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.120
I gave him the Mark of Cain,
which means no one can hurt him,

05:30.121 --> 05:31.122
not even you.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.207
And, in exchange,

05:35.626 --> 05:37.003
he gave me your seed.

05:37.086 --> 05:40.089
-What?
-And Satanic miracle of miracles,

05:41.549 --> 05:42.592
I am with child.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.844
No. Your child!

05:44.927 --> 05:46.220
Your child.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.186
What you say is true.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.607
But I already have an heir.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.026
-Sabrina.
-You wouldn't...

06:01.861 --> 06:05.990
kill your own son, now would you?

06:10.620 --> 06:11.579
Son?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.748
Oh, yes,

06:14.749 --> 06:15.917
it's a boy.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.879
A mother knows these things.

06:22.256 --> 06:26.427
This is not a pardon, Lilith,
it's merely a stay of execution.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.179
In the meantime,

06:28.262 --> 06:32.725
perhaps you could sort out the mess
your daughter's made in Hell,

06:35.353 --> 06:37.313
if only for our child's sake.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.440
Very well.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.361
Summon the Infernal Court.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.033
Tell them Daddy's back,

06:50.576 --> 06:54.122
and he's very, very angry.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.917
They were here!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.627
The witches.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.295
They killed four of our tribe.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.383
The Great Flowering of the Green Man
is almost upon us.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.843
Calm yourself, lover.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.638
And the blood of our dearly departed

07:11.806 --> 07:13.933
nourishes the Green Man.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.393
Have faith, my love.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.020
It is our time.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.110
What is this?

07:24.861 --> 07:27.613
We found him hiding in the shadows.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.742
My name is Faustus Blackwood,

07:35.705 --> 07:37.165
and you cannot kill me,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.126
for I bear the Mark of Cain.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.296
Why have you come here?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.630
I seek an alliance with you.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.466
Your enemy is my enemy.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.010
The Church of Night betrayed me,
and I wish them dead.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.179
Go on.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.100
You can kill the witches in their beds
while they sleep.

07:56.184 --> 08:00.480
There are tunnels and a secret door
known only to myself.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.774
I lead you in. You kill them.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.153
Nagaina and I have business,

08:08.404 --> 08:10.698
but if we lent you some of our men,

08:12.158 --> 08:15.161
what do you get, Faustus Blackwood?

08:15.244 --> 08:17.038
They stole something from me,

08:18.956 --> 08:20.374
and I want it back.

08:22.126 --> 08:26.130
<i>♪ Missing out</i>
<i>Yet you're growing older ♪</i>

08:29.133 --> 08:30.218
Are you scared?

08:31.302 --> 08:32.553
A little.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.306
Okay, maybe a lot.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.267
But I'm also happy.

08:39.810 --> 08:43.189
I never thought I'd meet anyone
who would accept me as I am.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.608
Not until you.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.904
-I feel the same way.
-What do you mean?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.717
I'm a hobgoblin.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.718
Cool!

09:12.802 --> 09:13.844
Um...

09:13.928 --> 09:15.429
What does that mean, exactly?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.681
I can run...

09:17.557 --> 09:18.391
fast.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.398
Theo, are you sure
you wanna do this tonight?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.234
I do.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.657
I mean, only virgins can be sacrificed
to the, uh... the Green Man, right?

09:35.533 --> 09:36.617
Great.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.996
I really like you, Robin,

09:40.079 --> 09:42.999
and I really, really want to be with you.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.933
<i>♪ I'm losing my mind for you ♪</i>

10:02.643 --> 10:05.271
<i>♪ All the wicked things you do ♪</i>

10:09.191 --> 10:10.026
Everything okay?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.654
Yeah.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.615
Yeah.

10:29.045 --> 10:29.920
What?

10:30.671 --> 10:32.632
What is it? Talk to me.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.218
I really don't wanna ask this,

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
especially not right now.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.099
Do you still love Sabrina?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.059
What?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.436
No.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.980
No, Rosalind.

10:48.981 --> 10:49.857
I love you.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.946
What are you seeing when you kiss me?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.157
You and Sabrina,

10:59.241 --> 11:00.201
together.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.037
God!

11:03.788 --> 11:07.583
I've never hated the cunning
more than I do at this moment.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.626
Rosalind.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.590
Sabrina was my first girlfriend.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.385
You've had other boyfriends before me.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.137
But I am all in with you.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.639
You have no idea.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.974
I don't care if that stupid
Pythagoras spell didn't work.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.018
I know what's in my heart.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.645
I love you.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.105
Oh, wait...

11:30.147 --> 11:32.191
what spell, Harvey?

11:35.528 --> 11:40.282
My lords and ladies of Disrule, rejoice.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.326
For I am returned.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.286
Kneel before me,

11:44.370 --> 11:45.955
and let's get back to business.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.331
Kneel before you?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.876
Weren't you dethroned and imprisoned
by your own witches?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.215
Any more questions?

11:56.924 --> 11:58.259
Lord Morningstar?

11:59.927 --> 12:02.221
-Oh, this should be good.
-Yes, and you are?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.348
Caliban, Prince of Hell.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.269
How can you be Prince of Hell
when I, who am Hell itself,

12:08.352 --> 12:09.645
know nothing of you?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398
Respectfully, my lord Lucifer,

12:12.857 --> 12:14.275
we are in the middle of a quest

12:14.358 --> 12:17.153
for the three objects
of the Unholy Regalia.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.280
Yes, I'm quite aware, Beelzebub.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.907
Infernal protocol must be followed.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.077
The contest must be seen to the end.

12:25.161 --> 12:29.665
Caliban and Sabrina
have each found one item.

12:29.749 --> 12:34.462
Whoever finds the third,
Judas Iscariot's 30 pieces of silver,

12:34.545 --> 12:36.922
will sit upon the throne of Hell.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.469
And not even you can interfere
with that quest.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.762
Where, then, is my daughter?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.054
She'll turn up.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.849
She usually does.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.851
<i>This is insane.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:52.521
Aunt Hilda was turned into a spider
and buried in the Cain Pit.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.232
Aunt Zee is downstairs,
hovering between life and death.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.359
Pagans are trying to take over Greendale.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.404
My father is who knows where,
and despite all our efforts,

13:00.488 --> 13:01.447
we are still powerless.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.324
We need energy.

13:03.407 --> 13:07.536
That is the crux,
and I think I know of a way we can get it,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.622
but it is quite cutthroat.

13:09.705 --> 13:13.626
Ambrose, as things stand right now,
Aunt Hilda may not resurrect.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.712
Aunt Zee might not wake up, ever.

13:17.463 --> 13:22.551
Using the hedge witches to imbue you
with power gave me the idea.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.471
And I found a spell, a siphoning spell.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.307
If we can get them into the center
of our stone circle,

13:28.390 --> 13:31.060
we can take their energy,
replenish our coven,

13:31.143 --> 13:33.938
and most importantly, our aunties.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.607
Okay, then why aren't we already doing
the siphoning spell?

13:36.690 --> 13:37.525
Right.

13:37.608 --> 13:41.028
Because the hedge witches are older,
and there are only a few of them.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.490
-Siphoning would likely kill them.
-Then they would die with honor.

13:44.573 --> 13:47.159
No, we didn't invite these witches here
to slaughter them.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.036
That's what the pagans would do. We...

13:49.495 --> 13:50.996
We have to figure out a different way.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.333
Huh. Unless you know of a younger, fitter,

13:54.416 --> 13:56.627
more nubile coven
to bring into the circle--

13:56.710 --> 13:57.545
Hold on.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.925
It's the very definition
of an unholy Magdalene, but...

14:04.176 --> 14:07.471
Ambrose, I think I already belong to one.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.726
Baron-yo, leaders of the Gede,

14:13.727 --> 14:16.605
have mercy on this here precious soul

14:16.689 --> 14:18.482
and leave her be,

14:19.692 --> 14:22.778
for it is not yet her time.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.086
Sabrina?

14:40.504 --> 14:41.547
Ambrose?

15:08.991 --> 15:09.825
Hilda?

15:11.410 --> 15:12.453
You're here?

15:14.788 --> 15:15.789
Zelds!

15:15.873 --> 15:17.583
You're just in time for breakfast!

15:17.666 --> 15:20.711
Sit yourself down,
Dr. Cee will be down in a minute.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.132
-Sister?
<i>-</i>Yes!

15:25.674 --> 15:27.343
I don't believe he's coming.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.803
Don't you recall what happened?

15:30.512 --> 15:31.722
What do you mean?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.767
You transformed into a giant spider.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.478
You killed him.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.229
Then I killed you.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.817
You're in the Cain Pit,
and Ms. Wardwell, I believe, shot me.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.528
We must be in the Nether Realm.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.491
Even in death,
you have to ruin things, don't you?

15:50.574 --> 15:54.662
Yes, well, we must divine a way back
so that we can stop the pagans,

15:54.745 --> 15:57.331
and before we find ourselves
permanently dead.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.625
Hello?

16:00.793 --> 16:01.627
Sisters?

16:02.086 --> 16:02.962
I'm home.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.259
-Edward!
-Edward!

16:13.514 --> 16:14.556
Roz!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.100
Can I talk to you for a sec?

16:16.183 --> 16:19.979
Sure. I kinda wanna talk to you too.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.730
But you go first.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.898
Oh, okay.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.609
Well, I find myself in need of a young,

16:25.693 --> 16:29.530
energetic group of women
who often chant and move in unison.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.532
The Ravenettes?

16:31.615 --> 16:32.533
Exactly.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.495
I mean, what are cheerleaders
if not a kind of coven?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.416
Any chance you'd be willing to help me
with an extra special performance

16:40.499 --> 16:41.667
at the Academy this afternoon?

16:42.710 --> 16:45.254
Ambrose has a plan to re-energize
the Church of Night's members.

16:45.337 --> 16:50.259
It's literally a matter of life and death,
but I can't do it without your help.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.930
How can I say no to that?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.473
Thanks, Roz. You're the best.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.727
What did you wanna talk to me about?

16:59.810 --> 17:00.686
Oh...

17:02.062 --> 17:03.022
it can wait.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.735
So how exactly are we supposed
to get the Baxter High Ravenettes

17:07.818 --> 17:09.445
to perform at your witch school?

17:09.528 --> 17:12.573
I might be able to pull off
a tiny spell of persuasion.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.284
Hey, girls!
What are you two talking about?

17:19.121 --> 17:22.041
So, what is this place again?

17:22.124 --> 17:26.879
And, uh, not be mean,
but who are all these weird people?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.298
Just like we told you.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.134
It's... sort of a multi-use space
for performance art.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.762
Perfect place for a flash mob, right?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.722
-Mm-hmm!
-Totes!

17:37.222 --> 17:39.975
Has either of you seen Dorcas?
Why is she never where we need her?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.102
She said she was coming.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.898
Prudence, we really must start.
Dorcas can join in when she arrives.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.576
<i>♪ Oh, Mickey, you're so fine</i>
<i>You're so fine you blow my mind ♪</i>

17:57.659 --> 18:00.162
<i>♪ Hey, Mickey</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:29.733
Goddess Terpsichore, Mother of Dance.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.945
We offer you muses,
enchant them with trance.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.864
Let body and movement and spirit romance.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.992
Your powers to our coven,
dark magicks enhance.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.726
Roz.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.145
Roz...

19:07.146 --> 19:08.772
thank you so, so much.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.150
Lizzie, you have no idea
how incredibly important that was.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.069
How are you guys feeling?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.238
Uh... a little woozy.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.240
Like that time Billy gave me mono.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.868
Yeah, just sleep for 16 to 18 hours,
and you should be fine.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.911
Well, well.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.790
I see the Academy's changed in my absence.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.375
-Lucifer?
-Guess again.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.501
Father!

19:34.131 --> 19:35.132
Ravenettes!

19:35.215 --> 19:36.341
Huddle up!

19:36.425 --> 19:37.718
Everybody grab hands.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.404
Roz?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.407
What... what happened?

20:02.993 --> 20:06.622
We were all gonna go check out
a new space for practice.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.375
But you thought it would be better
if we stayed at Baxter High.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.212
Right, okay.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.090
Sabrina?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
Where did you bring us?

20:18.967 --> 20:20.093
Pandemonium.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.553
Everyone will be safe here.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.804
Safe?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.766
Sabrina, you just sent what remains
of our coven to Hell.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.893
Oh, praise be heaven!
We left the effigies behind!

20:27.976 --> 20:29.978
-I'll go get them!
-No! It's too dangerous, cousin.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.397
Those effigies are full of energies
our aunties need.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.690
-Be right back.
-Be careful.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.528
Ms. Spellman!

20:40.530 --> 20:43.408
Blackwood! So you're with the pagans now.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.661
Strange bedfellows, I admit.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.497
But these are extraordinary times.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.124
Tell me, the hedge witches
in the Desecrated Church,

20:51.917 --> 20:53.377
they're yours, aren't they?

20:54.002 --> 20:56.004
-What did you do to them?
-Those withered crones?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.714
They're not even worth killing.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.633
Unlike you and your family.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.890
This one is ours!

21:07.933 --> 21:10.477
We found this witch
in one of the cells in the dungeon.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.896
She was already dead.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.690
Dorcas?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.942
But who did this to you, child?

21:17.734 --> 21:18.694
I did.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.654
Agatha?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.448
Will you take care of me, Father?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.244
I'm good at killing things now.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.413
Why, yes, my dear child.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.373
You may be of use to me.

21:34.084 --> 21:38.505
I want... every... last... Spellman...

21:39.715 --> 21:40.549
dead.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.843
The rest of your coven is gone.

21:42.926 --> 21:46.430
My former coven was your quarry, pagan,
not mine.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.891
My prize is something else.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.936
Likely hidden within these walls.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.691
But do keep looking,
those witches can't have gone far.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.945
I bumped into Father Blackwood.
He's no longer bonded with the Dark Lord,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.905
which means we've got my father
to worry about.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.074
Yes, you do, daughter!

22:08.285 --> 22:11.455
Lucifer and Lilith,
the Dream Team, back together again.

22:11.538 --> 22:15.208
Don't mistake survival
or co-dependency for love.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.753
We are very much not together.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.297
Playtime is over, Sabrina.
The Kings have called

22:20.380 --> 22:23.091
for the third challenge
of the Unholy Regalia.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.178
You must retrieve
Judas's 30 pieces of silver

22:26.261 --> 22:29.222
and secure the infernal throne
for the House of Morningstar.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.391
Unfortunately,
my family needs me back on Earth.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.311
I am your family, Sabrina.
And though you have betrayed me,

22:34.394 --> 22:37.022
I will see you upon the throne
ruling by my side.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.690
My aunties are on death's door.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.443
I can deliver the effigies to them,
cousin,

22:41.526 --> 22:43.487
and protect them from Blackwood
until they recover.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.155
-You can't go alone!
-I'll go with him.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.284
-My sisters are still unaccounted for.
-What are you two saying?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.036
That you want me to go on this quest?

22:51.119 --> 22:52.788
The power siphoning might have worked,

22:52.871 --> 22:55.332
but perhaps temporarily,
and there may be a battle to be fought

22:55.415 --> 22:58.126
with Blackwood tonight, yes,
but there is a much bigger war brewing.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.212
The pagans are coming for all of us,

23:00.712 --> 23:04.383
and the Unholy Regalia would give you
the infernal power to defeat them.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.388
Well, it's decided then.

23:10.514 --> 23:16.019
You shall win the final challenge
and take your place as Queen of Hell,

23:16.895 --> 23:20.774
keeping the throne warm
for your little brother.

23:23.735 --> 23:28.031
Right, and all I have to do is
betray our aunties.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.200
Well, this is the Judas challenge.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.619
Betrayal was kind of his thing.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.248
Ambrose, Prudence,

23:36.331 --> 23:38.792
protect the Spellman house
and our aunties at all costs.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.170
The rest of the coven stay here.
No more of us can die.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.716
Let's finish this.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.303
Edward, we have so many questions.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.055
I'll answer those I can, sister.

23:52.139 --> 23:56.977
Well, to begin with, did you know
the truth about Sabrina's lineage?

23:57.060 --> 23:58.937
-That the Dark Lord was her father?
-Oh, yeah.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.731
Yes.

24:02.232 --> 24:06.695
Diana and I made an appeal
to the Dark Lord, begged for a child.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.657
Well, Sabrina's been quite the handful.
You could've warned us.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.076
No, Sabrina needed to find her own path.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.662
As you, Zelda, must find yours now.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.709
I will guide you and follow you
as I always have.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.920
Aww. Like a little angel
on your little shoulder, isn't he?

24:24.004 --> 24:25.046
No!

24:26.047 --> 24:27.132
Like my <i>mèt-tèt!</i>

24:28.258 --> 24:29.134
My what?

24:29.217 --> 24:33.513
That comely Vodou priestess Marie
said that each of us has a <i>mèt-tèt.</i>

24:33.597 --> 24:36.975
A spirit,
a guide that's been with us all our life.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.644
-Perhaps that's why I'm here.
-Hello?

24:39.728 --> 24:43.607
Why we're here. Perhaps this is
where I'm meant to find the solution,

24:43.690 --> 24:47.027
and once I find it, we'll be able
to go home, to our real home.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.820
But what solution, specifically?

24:48.904 --> 24:50.489
To everything, Hilda!

24:50.572 --> 24:53.617
To defeat the pagans.
To finally replenish our coven's gifts.

24:56.536 --> 25:01.291
Edward, as my <i>mèt-tèt,</i>
can you tell us where to go, what to do?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.002
We'll start in the past.

25:04.085 --> 25:04.920
Ooh!

25:07.047 --> 25:07.923
Do we go--

25:08.006 --> 25:09.966
He knows
that's the botanical rooms, right?

25:10.050 --> 25:13.053
-Hilda, it's the Nether Realm.
-Didn't know I'd have to walk.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.763
Thought there'd be some perks.

25:18.099 --> 25:21.061
That's me, as a girl!

25:21.728 --> 25:23.063
And Faustus!

25:23.647 --> 25:26.274
Oh, when we were students at the Academy!

25:27.067 --> 25:28.276
I remember this.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.904
Time exists simultaneously
in the Nether Realm.

25:30.987 --> 25:33.031
-We're simply visiting a memory.
-Cool.

25:33.114 --> 25:37.244
Faustus, what is it you're reading
that's got you in such a snit?

25:37.869 --> 25:38.703
Rubbish.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.001
Nothing you need to know about,
Zelda Spellman.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.587
It's best we get to class.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.177
Come along now, Zelda.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.515
Always a little tyrant, wasn't he?

25:59.349 --> 26:02.269
I never did get to see
what he tore out of that book.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.313
Well, there's nothing stopping you now,
is there? Go on.

26:14.489 --> 26:15.532
What does it mean?

26:17.659 --> 26:19.411
I dunno. Hmm...

26:19.995 --> 26:22.998
We just celebrated the Hare Moon.
Think it's got anything to do with that?

26:23.081 --> 26:26.793
Perhaps, but no, there's something else.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.468
That Prince of Clay
will never find Judas's silver.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.845
What makes you so sure?

26:36.928 --> 26:40.015
Because Judas himself was the only person
who knows where it is.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.809
And I am the one person
who can take you to Judas.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.144
Careful, Dark Lord.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.980
Sabrina must complete the task on her own.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.274
Any help from you
in front of the Kings of Hell

26:49.357 --> 26:51.401
and the challenge
could be deemed a forfeit.

26:51.484 --> 26:56.448
Let the final challenge for the coins
of the great betrayer,

26:56.531 --> 27:00.076
Judas Iscariot, begin!

27:05.749 --> 27:07.876
<i>Go to the Ninth Circle,</i>
<i>the hottest in Hell.</i>

27:07.959 --> 27:10.295
<i>There, in a volcanic cave,</i>
<i>embedded in the walls,</i>

27:10.378 --> 27:12.714
<i>you will find the three worst betrayers</i>
<i>in history,</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:16.217
<i>Cassius, Brutus, and Judas Iscariot.</i>

27:18.845 --> 27:23.516
Mambo Marie,
this effigy is infused with life force.

27:24.267 --> 27:27.270
With any luck,
its power will transfer into Auntie Zee

27:27.812 --> 27:29.356
helping to right this ship.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.358
But wait, we have our powers back.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.401
Can't we just heal her?

27:34.319 --> 27:37.947
It is not a matter
of her physical body healing now.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.451
It is her soul
that must find its way back to us.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.746
-Marie.
-Yeah.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.457
Father Blackwood and the pagans
have taken over the Academy.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.958
They could be coming here next.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.422
Could you please keep her safe whilst
we do what we can to protect the house?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.717
It is my honor.

27:59.302 --> 28:00.303
Thank you.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.522
Prudence,
I'll be the first line of defense

28:10.605 --> 28:12.899
holding the perimeter
against Blackwood and the banshee.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.776
Will you stay and guard the house?

28:14.859 --> 28:17.070
Okay, Ambrose,
but if my father approaches?

28:17.153 --> 28:20.573
You will have the killing blow,
I promise you.

28:50.937 --> 28:51.938
Judas Iscariot.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.114
-Who is that?
-I'm Sabrina Morningstar,

29:01.197 --> 29:02.657
daughter of Lucifer Morningstar.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.413
He himself put me here.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.790
I've come to ask you, Judas,

29:10.874 --> 29:14.127
where are the 30 pieces of silver
you were paid to betray the Nazarene?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.879
What will you give me

29:17.380 --> 29:19.674
to tell you the secret of their location?

29:25.930 --> 29:30.310
Water.
The taste of cold water on your lips.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.604
What say you, Judas?

29:33.396 --> 29:35.607
Tell me how to get the silver,
and it's yours.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.695
There is an easy way,

29:41.529 --> 29:44.073
in which the silver simply appears to you.

29:44.157 --> 29:48.578
And a harder way,
in which you must seek it out.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.497
For once, let's go with what's easy.

29:50.580 --> 29:56.461
All you need to is betray someone you love
with a kiss,

29:56.544 --> 29:58.087
-as I did.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.719
Just one kiss
and the silver appears to me?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.305
Yes.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.142
I'll be right back.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.062
Harvey, hey!

30:15.355 --> 30:16.231
Sabrina?

30:17.023 --> 30:20.151
-What are you doing here?
-I, uh, wanted to see you.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.737
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, fine.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.073
I just need to ask you a favor.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.283
-Did Roz talk to you or something?
-No!

30:27.909 --> 30:29.244
Why, did something happen?

30:29.744 --> 30:31.120
Um...

30:31.913 --> 30:32.831
No.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.875
More like what didn't happen.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.876
You guys okay?

30:37.460 --> 30:38.837
To be honest, I'm not sure.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.882
Oh, Harvey.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.717
I know.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.014
I love her so much, 'Brina.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.058
I don't know what's wrong.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.687
I can't do it.

30:56.145 --> 30:58.815
I won't betray you or Roz.
No matter what Hell throws at me.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.233
What? What are you talking about?

31:00.316 --> 31:03.152
You and Roz are great together.
Forget that stupid spell.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.029
For all we know, Caliban made it up.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.867
She loves you, you love her,
don't let anything ruin that, okay?

31:09.284 --> 31:10.410
You guys are endgame.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.037
I believe it.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.456
Stay safe, Harvey.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.092
Well, that didn't work.
So tell me, Judas...

31:27.343 --> 31:28.303
what's the hard way?

31:28.386 --> 31:30.513
Are you familiar with the Field of Blood?

31:31.139 --> 31:32.515
Just that it's a burial ground.

31:32.599 --> 31:37.854
My silver is buried in a crypt
with the first vampire,

31:38.479 --> 31:40.440
deep beneath the Field of Blood.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.067
Okay, if you tell me
I'm about to meet Dracula--

31:43.151 --> 31:46.529
His name is Vlad the Impaler.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.698
Vlad the Impaler?

31:48.781 --> 31:51.534
But he's... he's dead, right?

31:51.618 --> 31:52.785
Yes.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.705
The pieces are in a bag at his side.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.168
Count them to be sure they're all there.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.253
Copy. How do I get to his tomb?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.547
You open a portal.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.759
I can tell you the words, but first...

32:09.135 --> 32:10.970
give me my water.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.516
-Shh!

32:15.600 --> 32:16.768
Settle down, children.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.398
Please, I am not in the mood today
for your foolish...

32:23.775 --> 32:24.776
chitter-chatter.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.694
Jeez, what's wrong with her?

32:28.947 --> 32:32.909
<i>Attention, students. This is Mrs. Meeks</i>
<i>with an exciting announcement.</i>

32:32.992 --> 32:36.579
<i>Baxter High has been invited</i>
<i>to the Final Night Festivities</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
<i>at the town carnival!</i>

32:38.498 --> 32:42.043
<i>Free admission! Free rides!</i>
<i>Free caramel apples!</i>

32:42.126 --> 32:43.211
<i>Tonight only!</i>

32:43.294 --> 32:45.505
Final night? That can't be good.

32:45.588 --> 32:49.300
<i>Also, will Ms. Rosalind Walker,</i>
<i>Mr. Harvey Kinkle,</i>

32:49.384 --> 32:53.846
<i>and Mr. Theo Putnam</i>
<i>please report to the principal's office,</i>

32:53.930 --> 32:56.557
<i>to collect some fun prizes!</i>

33:10.446 --> 33:11.739
Oh, crap!<i> </i>Run!

33:25.753 --> 33:27.255
Theo, where's Robin?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.090
-I don't know.
<i>-</i>Guys...

33:29.173 --> 33:30.133
Shh!

33:43.479 --> 33:44.564
Children...

33:46.315 --> 33:51.029
don't be scared.

33:52.488 --> 33:55.575
You're going to be
a part of something beautiful.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.288
Greendale will be the New Eden.

34:01.664 --> 34:05.084
The seeds of ruin
and rebirth will blossom.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.586
His seeds.

34:06.669 --> 34:11.215
The Green Man, the oldest of the Old Gods,
is returning.

34:13.760 --> 34:19.682
Only one last thing is needed
for his Great Flowering to begin.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.185
The innocent blood of a young virgin.

34:23.770 --> 34:28.441
One of you still is suitable.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.814
Look upon me, child.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.695
Not these ones. You won't have these ones!

35:15.113 --> 35:16.489
Betrayer!

35:20.451 --> 35:21.661
Hello?

35:21.744 --> 35:23.496
Who turned off the lights?

35:28.042 --> 35:29.877
Yes, can I help you?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.838
No, we were just leaving.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.682
What the hell just happened?
Did we just--

35:42.765 --> 35:45.726
-Did we just teleport or--
-No, Robin saved us.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.521
-He's a hobgoblin.
-We have to go.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.858
All of us. And as many others
as we can convince to leave Greendale.

35:51.941 --> 35:52.817
Why?

35:53.276 --> 35:54.735
Well, you heard them, Harvey.

35:54.819 --> 35:59.866
It is time. The Green Man is coming back,
and all who are flesh will die.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.367
We can't just leave.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.787
We have to fight.
We have to stop that from happening.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.289
-We need--
-Sabrina!

36:06.747 --> 36:10.501
We need Sabrina. We do.
Except that I think she's still in Hell.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.211
Can we reach her down there?

36:14.839 --> 36:18.134
Wait! Yes. We can!

36:18.217 --> 36:19.927
That magick marker of hers.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.430
The magick marker she uses to IM Nick!

36:22.513 --> 36:25.183
It's in her locker!
Maybe we can use it to send her a message.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.727
-Do you know her locker number?
-And combination.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.855
She's my best friend.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.360
This way, sisters.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.112
- Is that--

36:38.821 --> 36:41.282
Wait, I recognize that sound.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.869
It's Sabrina! When we got her.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.120
Watch this now.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.997
What is that infernal bleating?

36:48.080 --> 36:50.291
It sounds like a baby!

36:52.627 --> 36:55.296
Father Lucifer, it's Sabrina!

36:55.379 --> 36:58.174
But what does that mean for Edward?

36:58.674 --> 36:59.550
And Diana?

37:02.261 --> 37:03.387
It can't be good news.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.328
The half-moon.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.290
Curiouser and curiouser.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.876
There's one last thing you must see.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.216
Okay, here we go again.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.384
Sabrina?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.762
Nicholas? What are you doing here?

37:44.845 --> 37:46.347
Watching the bar for Dorian.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.517
-What's going on?
-Nick, everything.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.396
My Aunt Zelda was shot.
My Aunt Hilda was also shot.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.274
Blackwood's come back.
He's working with the pagans now.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.359
-What?
-Yes, and I have to find the final piece

37:58.442 --> 38:00.403
of the Unholy Regalia before Caliban does.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.364
Wait, seriously?

38:05.741 --> 38:08.703
The Sabrina Spellman I know
would never leave her family in trouble

38:08.786 --> 38:10.079
to go on some stupid quest.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.624
But I guess you're not a Spellman anymore.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.334
You're a Morningstar.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.295
For your sake, you better hope I'm both.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.172
Good luck, Sabrina.

38:24.218 --> 38:27.138
With these words,
I seek Vlad the immortal.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.015
Open to me this hidden portal.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.882
The silver.

39:28.115 --> 39:32.745
One, two, three, four...

39:42.088 --> 39:43.172
Six.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.094
Listen to my voice.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.722
Hear my words.

39:51.806 --> 39:57.019
Your thoughts and your will belong to me,

39:57.103 --> 39:59.313
and only me, now.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.233
Say you understand.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.818
I understand.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.030
Did my father send you?

40:09.698 --> 40:10.616
No...

40:11.700 --> 40:12.952
Judas did.

40:14.703 --> 40:17.665
Judas <i>is</i> my father.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.084
The father of vampires.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.295
What's your name, girl?

40:26.215 --> 40:27.967
Sabrina.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.556
You're very beautiful, Sabrina.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.147
Say thank you.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.526
Thank you.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.866
You're going to let me drink your blood

40:51.949 --> 40:55.369
and feast on your flesh, aren't you?

40:56.912 --> 40:58.497
Of course.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.918
That's a good girl.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.049
Your neck,

41:10.885 --> 41:14.013
is so very...

41:16.390 --> 41:17.558
very...

41:29.153 --> 41:31.864
Your blood! It burns!

41:34.033 --> 41:35.367
You're a celestial?

41:35.451 --> 41:37.745
My father was an angel. I have his blood.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.457
Also? Consent, it's real.

41:47.963 --> 41:51.217
-Still no word back from Sabrina.
- What's taking her so long?

41:51.300 --> 41:53.219
Harvey, we don't even know
if she got the message.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.137
She didn't. But I did.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.806
But that was meant for Sabrina.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.351
That's not how the magick marker works.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.228
And I wouldn't expect her back
any time soon.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.106
-Now, who needs help, and why?
-We do.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.025
It's the pagans.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.777
Catch me up, talk fast.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.320
The Great Flowering is upon us.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.365
They've been trying to resurrect
the Green Man for centuries,

42:14.448 --> 42:15.491
and it's finally happening.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.079
All flesh fails when he flowers.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.497
What the hell does that mean?

42:21.580 --> 42:23.916
First, the... the locals are "seeded."

42:23.999 --> 42:27.086
They're implanted with a spore,

42:27.169 --> 42:28.879
something they eat
that can grow inside them.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.589
The caramel apples
they're gonna give away.

42:31.298 --> 42:34.051
And then, when the Green Man is ready,

42:34.593 --> 42:37.513
when he's ripe with the blood
of a local virgin,

42:39.640 --> 42:41.350
that is when he will bloom.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.019
And then what?

42:46.438 --> 42:47.815
It's the pollination.

42:50.192 --> 42:52.278
It'll be the end of everyone in Greendale.

42:53.654 --> 42:54.530
How do we stop it?

42:55.864 --> 42:57.116
You don't!

42:59.410 --> 43:01.203
It is as Robin Goodfellow says...

43:02.371 --> 43:04.873
all flesh fails!

43:04.957 --> 43:06.500
I told you.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.921
Once I have a virgin's scent,
none can hide from me.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.140
If that banshee comes
anywhere near Aunt Hilda,

43:21.223 --> 43:24.184
you claw her to pieces, Salem, okay?

43:26.645 --> 43:27.605
Good boy.

43:29.023 --> 43:29.982
Settle in.

43:31.317 --> 43:32.776
It's going to be a long day.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.285
Will that banshee shut up already?

43:50.711 --> 43:51.629
Hello?

43:58.761 --> 44:00.304
Agatha, is that you?

44:02.640 --> 44:03.599
Agatha?

44:04.391 --> 44:05.851
Agatha, is that you?

44:12.358 --> 44:13.484
Agatha?

44:26.121 --> 44:27.539
I've been looking for you.

44:28.582 --> 44:29.541
Agatha?

44:31.543 --> 44:33.253
Agatha, whose blood is that?

44:34.380 --> 44:36.215
Why, our sister's, of course!

44:38.467 --> 44:42.471
And now she's dead, dead, dead.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.264
Dorcas's?

44:44.348 --> 44:45.849
Don't be sad.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.645
First, I played with Dorcas,

44:50.896 --> 44:52.398
and now I wanna play with you.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.067
No, sister. Stop. Stop, sister.
I don't want to--

44:58.070 --> 44:59.655
No, sister. No!

44:59.738 --> 45:01.198
-No!

45:02.616 --> 45:04.243
Sister, no!

45:06.203 --> 45:07.538
I'm sorry.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.958
Black... wood.

45:19.758 --> 45:20.759
Tell me, daughter.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.095
Where are you keeping Judas and Judith?

45:24.763 --> 45:28.934
I need their help
to find something precious to me.

45:44.825 --> 45:48.078
<i>Ambrose, come to me, hurry.</i>

45:48.787 --> 45:49.913
Prudence.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.335
No, no, no, no, no!

46:00.048 --> 46:01.550
Blackwood.

46:02.509 --> 46:04.219
Blackwood. He's here.

46:04.678 --> 46:07.222
He's... he's looking for...

46:10.476 --> 46:11.935
Stop him.

46:13.353 --> 46:15.314
I can't. I can't leave you.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.484
-I can't go, no.
-You must.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.683
May your <i>mét-tét</i> protect and guide you.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.395
May the light show you the way.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.654
<i>Edward,</i>
<i>what are you trying to show us?</i>

47:07.741 --> 47:09.243
Oh, Hilda.

47:11.995 --> 47:14.706
It seems these witches are standing vigil,

47:14.790 --> 47:17.960
praying for a safe crossing
to the afterlife, but for whom?

47:29.388 --> 47:31.682
Zelds, it's you.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.354
Darling...

47:38.897 --> 47:40.649
look who's come to see you.

47:42.901 --> 47:43.902
Auntie, I'm here.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.323
I came to say that I love you.

47:49.783 --> 47:51.910
And I couldn't have asked
for a better mother.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.748
And your work is done here.

47:59.084 --> 48:00.335
You can rest now.

48:03.213 --> 48:04.464
You can let go now.

48:12.806 --> 48:15.559
Aunt Hilda, she's gone.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.527
She waited for you, you know.

48:27.195 --> 48:29.573
-To say bye.

48:44.421 --> 48:49.134
The new moon,
the half-moon, the full moon.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.096
Maiden, Mother, Crone.

48:53.847 --> 48:54.848
Of course!

48:55.515 --> 48:58.894
The three phases of the moon.
The three phases of a witch's life.

48:58.977 --> 49:00.145
I understand.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.732
I have the answer.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.985
I know how the coven can regain its power
and defeat the pagans!

49:24.586 --> 49:25.587
Faustus!

49:27.214 --> 49:28.674
I curse you, Blackwood.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.776
Did you get them?

49:47.859 --> 49:50.070
I did. Your son nearly killed me.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.947
Let me feel their weight

49:52.489 --> 49:53.615
in my hand

49:54.533 --> 49:55.826
one last time.

50:09.172 --> 50:10.173
Ah.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.095
How I love when you do
all the work for me.

50:15.679 --> 50:16.888
What?

50:18.015 --> 50:18.890
Caliban?

50:18.974 --> 50:20.267
<i>Nostra versa loca!</i>

50:23.854 --> 50:24.688
Caliban!

50:24.771 --> 50:26.440
You knew what you had to do.

50:27.482 --> 50:30.652
Betray someone with a kiss,
and yet you did not.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.822
-Why is that?
<i>-</i>I'm not a betrayer, unlike you!

50:33.905 --> 50:35.073
Aren't you?

50:35.157 --> 50:37.367
Did you not choose this quest
over your family?

50:37.451 --> 50:39.161
Your friends?

50:39.244 --> 50:42.289
And while you were dashing off,
collecting trinkets,

50:43.331 --> 50:44.541
I was arranging a coup.

50:44.624 --> 50:46.918
My father and Lilith
won't let you get away with this!

50:47.002 --> 50:48.503
They don't have much choice!

50:51.173 --> 50:53.175
The House of Morningstar has fallen.

50:56.136 --> 50:59.848
All hail King Caliban.

50:59.931 --> 51:01.224
-No.
-Yes.

51:03.727 --> 51:04.770
Now...

51:05.937 --> 51:10.275
I have a mortal realm to conquer
and a tenth circle to create.

51:19.576 --> 51:22.954
Awaken, children, and witness his glory!

51:25.791 --> 51:31.713
Sadly, young Robin Goodfellow
and your warlock friend had to die.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.508
No!

51:34.591 --> 51:37.094
Robin! Robin!

51:37.177 --> 51:38.428
But not you.

51:39.679 --> 51:41.598
You pose no threat.

51:42.349 --> 51:46.061
You're merely meat, merely flesh,

51:46.144 --> 51:49.773
and I wanted you to see!

51:50.315 --> 51:51.858
- Roz!

51:51.942 --> 51:53.360
Please, somebody!

51:53.735 --> 51:55.946
Please help!

51:56.029 --> 51:57.197
Somebody!

51:57.280 --> 51:58.323
Somebody help me!

51:58.949 --> 51:59.866
Please!

52:00.408 --> 52:01.576
Behold!

52:02.077 --> 52:05.247
The great and terrible show is upon us!

52:05.789 --> 52:09.209
The Green Man is about to flower!

52:09.793 --> 52:11.211
Oh, don't be scared!

52:11.294 --> 52:12.546
This isn't the end!

52:13.046 --> 52:14.798
This is the beginning!

52:15.549 --> 52:20.554
And your friend, his virgin blood
is giving the Green Man life!

52:23.557 --> 52:24.641
Look!

52:25.934 --> 52:26.977
Look!

52:27.060 --> 52:28.395
No!

52:28.478 --> 52:29.479
Please!

52:39.156 --> 52:41.616
Sabrina, no!

52:59.843 --> 53:00.927
Ladies and gentlemen!

53:01.344 --> 53:02.846
Boys and girls!

53:02.929 --> 53:07.184
I give you the end of all flesh!

53:08.059 --> 53:09.019
Rejoice!

53:12.230 --> 53:13.315
Rejoice!

53:14.107 --> 53:15.275
Sabrina!

53:15.358 --> 53:16.943
Sabrina!

53:19.070 --> 53:20.488
<i>Rejoice!</i>

53:21.781 --> 53:23.200
<i>Rejoice!</i>

53:23.283 --> 53:24.701
<i>Sabrina!</i>

53:24.784 --> 53:26.328
<i>Sabrina!</i>
