<i>How far
would you go to find love?</i>

00:55.822 --> 00:58.632
<i>Oh! I don't know,
it depends on the love.</i>

00:58.691 --> 01:01.365
<i>Magical, beyond
your wildest dreams?</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.072
<i>I would kill for that.</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:06.304
<i>What if I told you,
you didn't have to?</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:07.834
<i>Consider this,</i>

01:08.802 --> 01:11.840
<i>you are the source of the love
that you want for your life.</i>

01:12.972 --> 01:14.532
It sounds too good to be true.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.309
It's not.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.286
Believe me when I tell you this.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.439
That's what your book
is about, isn't it?

01:22.982 --> 01:27.260
It's about getting over your past,
creating the love that you want,

01:27.921 --> 01:31.528
putting that love in your future
and then living into that future.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.906
So what's in Matthew Taylor's future?

01:39.032 --> 01:43.845
I am putting dinner and dancing
with the lovely you in my future.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.283
I don't date guys from work.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.947
- Come on, it's not a date.
- Oh, really? Then what is it?

01:54.581 --> 01:55.821
Let's find out.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.435
Sorry!

02:05.291 --> 02:06.395
It's okay.

02:07.527 --> 02:08.835
It usually goes away.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.567
Matthew, can I talk to you?

02:11.264 --> 02:12.299
You're done.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.002
Hey, bro.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.388
We are ready for you, Mr. Taylor.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.812
Okay. Can you check this out?

02:19.405 --> 02:21.612
- What's up? What am I looking at?
- Bestsellers list.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.581
- I thought we're ranked number 12.
- We were, now we are 14.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.888
I am sorry, Mr. Taylor,
but we really need you right now.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.361
- Of course!
- Okay, just chill out!

02:32.385 --> 02:34.729
Listen man, we went from 11 to 14,

02:34.787 --> 02:37.393
that's not the direction
we need to go to get to number one.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.267
These local talk show crazies
ain't cutting it for us.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.006
Then why are we doing a local circuit?
Because that's all we've got!

02:43.062 --> 02:46.236
I am terribly sorry, but if we don't
get going they are...

02:46.299 --> 02:48.819
- They are going to...
- Okay, they are going to just chill out.

02:49.202 --> 02:53.173
We have to get your face and our message
on a national show, period.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.751
Is there a reason you are telling me this
right before I do an interview?

02:55.775 --> 02:57.745
Yes, because I need
you to consider this...

02:57.770 --> 02:59.246
For the love of God, please!

02:59.279 --> 03:01.384
Will you just...
Will you just come with me please,

03:01.447 --> 03:02.721
just do me this solid.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.102
You have to go, she is losing it!

03:04.150 --> 03:06.858
Listen man, do your thing, man,
go get them, champ.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.927
Okay. You need a Percocet.

03:09.989 --> 03:12.589
Something in your life
to calm your ass down, be careful with her.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.864
Be careful. Get right to the stage.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.276
Please welcome my next guest,
Matthew Taylor!

03:27.941 --> 03:31.388
- Look at you.
- Look at you, Ms. Raquel.

03:32.645 --> 03:36.718
- You look beautiful as always.
- And you look hotter every time I see you.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.391
I am just saying.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.281
I think I'll take that as a compliment.

03:43.656 --> 03:47.160
You better because I don't say that
to just everybody, just so you know that.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.399
Okay, now I know.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.305
Look at that face.

04:01.608 --> 04:06.023
Hi! Sorry, I was on a very long phone call.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.655
He's cute.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.391
No, he's gorgeous.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.101
<i>It's been a pretty good week.</i>

04:20.125 --> 04:23.005
I mean, I have just been feeling good.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.237
Nothing has happened or anything. I just...

04:27.200 --> 04:30.181
I feel okay. First time in a long time.

04:30.903 --> 04:35.283
You know sometimes we can get
locked into a certain mode of feeling

04:35.341 --> 04:40.290
and even if that mode isn't comfortable,
like sadness or depression,

04:40.346 --> 04:44.192
it can become ingrained to the point
where it becomes our new baseline.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.230
That's a very normal part of the process.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.630
Do you think there is a little of that
going on with you maybe?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.326
No.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.836
Honestly, I just think I'm over it.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.068
What does that mean to you?

04:58.931 --> 05:04.005
It means that I am ready to put my divorce
behind me and get on with my life.

05:05.004 --> 05:08.679
- I am ready to end therapy.
- That's good, that's good.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.721
That means we are starting
to make real progress.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.778
Starting?

05:11.844 --> 05:14.757
As I said to you in the beginning,
therapy is marathon not a sprint.

05:15.248 --> 05:19.663
Well, my insurance only pays for sprints,
so, you know, I am going to wrap it up.

05:22.088 --> 05:25.729
Okay, just open my calendar.

05:53.953 --> 05:57.127
- Wow!
- Oh, my God!

05:59.092 --> 06:00.503
You have a whole lot of energy.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.945
I don't think I'll have to
work out for a month.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.017
I have a crazy idea.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.449
What? I'm listening.

06:20.413 --> 06:25.385
Let's spend all of tomorrow together.

06:27.086 --> 06:31.933
I will make breakfast and we will pack
a beach picnic and lay out.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.368
Oh,

06:33.426 --> 06:38.307
let's catch up play
or watch a double feature.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.846
Oh, it will be amazing.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.650
Unless you have plans.

06:53.613 --> 06:54.614
Well,

06:55.581 --> 06:58.289
I did. I mean, I do.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.163
I mean that's okay, right?

07:04.223 --> 07:05.702
Of course!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.832
I was just being silly.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.766
It was sweet!

07:12.832 --> 07:13.970
I should go.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.539
- No! No!
- Yeah!

07:15.601 --> 07:16.912
- I should.
- You don't have to...

07:16.936 --> 07:18.574
I should go.

07:19.005 --> 07:24.148
Uh, Lisette, you don't...
You don't have to go, seriously.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.950
I had a great time.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.821
I will see myself out.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.155
Ah, God!

07:31.451 --> 07:33.556
Did you at least take her to breakfast?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.724
T, it didn't even get that far.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.789
You are a dog!

07:36.856 --> 07:39.700
Oh, come on, cut it out.
She ripped up out of here.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.966
- I wanted her to stay.
- No, you didn't.

07:42.361 --> 07:45.342
Look, I am never going to get in the way
of a brother doing his thing,

07:45.398 --> 07:49.039
but a relationship guru should be
in a relationship longer than a minute.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.605
How about you just stick to doing your
thing and I will stick to doing mine?

07:52.939 --> 07:56.386
Getting you prepped for a national TV tour
is my thing.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.148
People love controversy, Matthew,
and they are going to start digging it up.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.459
What do you want me to do?
You want me to be in a relationship

08:03.483 --> 08:05.327
because you think
it will be better for my image?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.763
Image is everything, don't forget that.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.537
- Stop!
- Stop what?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.040
Stop looking at me like that!

08:19.098 --> 08:21.218
What do you mean?
That's what dads are supposed to do.

08:21.634 --> 08:26.140
Yeah, you are totally right and everything,
but, like, we are in public.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.982
Oh. my bad! My bad!

08:28.040 --> 08:30.850
I wouldn't want to mess up
your little cool points, sorry!

08:31.110 --> 08:32.554
Dad, you are so corny.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.582
- Oh, come on, that was funny.
- Corny!

08:36.349 --> 08:37.589
I thought it was funny.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.791
Hey, hey! Did you just stare down that boy?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.964
Seriously, I am 13,

08:48.027 --> 08:51.770
like 30% or whatever
of 13-year-olds are having sex.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.640
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute!

08:53.699 --> 08:56.543
You better be on the right side
of that 30%, young lady.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.708
I was just kidding. It's more like 10%.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.218
And yes, I am an angel.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.913
Hurry up already!

09:04.410 --> 09:07.084
10%! Oh, no! No!

09:19.458 --> 09:20.766
Aleya!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.237
- Aleya!
- That's crazy!

09:24.964 --> 09:27.410
Yeah, you can thank your Uncle Terry
for this silly thing.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.911
It's kind of cool.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.813
Wait, what are we doing in here?
You know what I look like already.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.716
I want to get it for Mom.

09:37.276 --> 09:41.122
Sweetheart, I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.618
What if I told you,
Mom and George are on the rocks

09:44.684 --> 09:46.527
and she might need to bounce back?

09:47.486 --> 09:50.194
- Did they? I mean are they?
- No,

09:50.256 --> 09:52.930
but I know she and George
are dying to read it.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.062
Look here, sweetheart,

09:55.094 --> 09:57.040
if your mom wanted
to read the book so bad,

09:57.697 --> 09:59.438
why didn't she just ask me for a copy?

09:59.665 --> 10:00.735
I don't know.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.337
She wants you to have your privacy
or whatever.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.847
You should ask her yourself.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.025
Hello?

10:24.090 --> 10:26.832
Whatever you're doing, drop it,
and get over to Nine stat.

10:26.892 --> 10:27.927
I can't.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.270
Look, I know exactly
what you're doing, okay?

10:30.329 --> 10:34.004
And your journey of self-discovery
is going to be there when you get home.

10:34.066 --> 10:37.138
Well, you go ahead and mock,
but as the great G.l. Gurdjieff says,

10:37.203 --> 10:39.481
"Without understanding the workings
and functions of his machine,

10:39.505 --> 10:40.575
"man cannot be free."

10:40.640 --> 10:43.382
Yes, and without a penis
your vagina would soon turn to stone.

10:43.442 --> 10:44.785
Very classy, Sarah.

10:44.844 --> 10:47.654
Just get over here!
I am not taking no for an answer.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.016
She's hung up.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.533
Dan 't get me wrong,

10:57.990 --> 11:02.234
<i>I just never got anything out of this life
by sitting around introspecting myself.</i>

11:02.762 --> 11:05.538
<i>The mind is an ugly place to dwell.</i>

11:06.365 --> 11:08.402
<i>We all hear those voices in our heads.</i>

11:08.601 --> 11:10.274
What is this guy talking about?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.044
<i>It's that same voice
that's asking you right now,</i>

11:13.105 --> 11:15.107
<i>what the hell is this guy talking about?</i>

11:15.174 --> 11:18.917
<i>Well, see, the key is to get
out of your head and get into action.</i>

11:19.545 --> 11:22.719
<i>And my book The Bounce Back
will help you do just that.</i>

11:26.085 --> 11:29.430
Oh, brother! How about this for action?

11:31.357 --> 11:37.035
Here is to Kristin and a rare night out
among the single and sexually active.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.336
- Woo!
- Turn up!

11:38.431 --> 11:39.432
Oh, brother.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.271
Cheers!

11:45.671 --> 11:47.014
- One more!
- Ah!

11:47.073 --> 11:48.916
- Again!
- Ah!

11:49.642 --> 11:51.622
- Two more! I lied.
- Ah!

11:51.844 --> 11:53.653
- You're nothing today!
- Ah!

11:53.713 --> 11:54.987
Nobody!

11:55.047 --> 11:57.789
You've got Big Vlad. That's me. That's it.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.491
- Where's your head at?
- Ah!

12:03.122 --> 12:05.295
One minute! Get your mind right.

12:05.357 --> 12:06.392
Yeah.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.833
Get back to work!

12:10.062 --> 12:11.769
Why do you let him talk to you like that?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.318
I pay him a lot of money
to talk to me like that.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.772
He is creepy!

12:16.202 --> 12:18.513
- You're going to stand up to him?
- I ain't afraid of him.

12:18.537 --> 12:19.538
Oh, please!

12:25.478 --> 12:26.718
Unbelievable!

12:27.813 --> 12:31.317
Oh, come on T,
don't sweat that national spotlight thing.

12:31.717 --> 12:32.752
We'll get there.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.456
The news cycle lasts minutes these days,

12:34.520 --> 12:37.797
either you're going viral
or you're played out, simple as that.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.293
What?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.506
I see you've got yourself an idea.
What? Spit it out!

12:44.764 --> 12:47.506
<i>- The George Addison Show.
- Don't even go there</i> T!

12:47.566 --> 12:48.977
- I am serious.
- Hey, what did I say?

12:49.001 --> 12:50.173
Hear me out.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.375
We've got to crack the bestseller top 10.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.975
He has a nationally syndicated talk show.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.419
I mean, we keep slipping points, we can
kiss getting to number one goodbye.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.617
Plus, there's a relationship
between you two.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.887
Thanks, T, the irony is not lost on me.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.597
I don't know what you mean by that,
but we need this.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.690
That's my family you're messing with.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.136
What are you talking about? Listen, man,

13:13.192 --> 13:16.503
Julie and Aleya look happier than ever.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.839
They're not going to mind you, you know,
working on George for a break.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.907
What is wrong with you?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.840
Oh, man!

13:28.808 --> 13:31.550
You're not afraid of me, huh?
You owe me some sits!

13:31.610 --> 13:34.420
Get in there! That's it! That's good!

13:35.881 --> 13:37.724
You must be an only child, huh?

13:38.350 --> 13:40.489
You're one ugly kid.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.163
Let's go faster!

13:42.221 --> 13:43.894
- Let's go!
- Okay!

13:46.725 --> 13:47.726
Matthew!

13:48.294 --> 13:49.364
Matthew. Come on, dawg.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.473
Why would you leave me in that gym
with that crazy man?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.374
- Terry, I've got to go, man.
- Look! Hey!

13:53.432 --> 13:55.434
I am sorry. I was out of line.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.514
I was out of line, man. Um,

13:59.038 --> 14:01.678
look, I know
this Bacardi-sponsored pool party.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.051
Boy, we could slide through there,
get you a little hot girlfriend.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.056
You know I am about to go do my seminar.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.318
You really should come.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.088
No, no, I'm cool, cool.
No, I have a perfectly healthy love life.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.595
Please! No, you don't!

14:12.651 --> 14:14.528
- How would you know?
- You're a grown man

14:14.587 --> 14:16.396
who has never been in love,
that's how I know.

14:16.455 --> 14:20.699
Look, man, bag yourself a girlfriend, dawg,
a famous one would be nice.

14:20.759 --> 14:21.760
Think about it.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.034
Up and coming relationship guru

14:24.096 --> 14:27.566
comes into a love thing
with a famous Hollywood actress.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.635
It sounds good, don't it? Do it!

14:32.271 --> 14:36.515
It's been valuable. I am
not saying it hasn't.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.391
I just don't know if this is for me.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.815
I see!

14:43.315 --> 14:45.693
And why is that you think?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.358
No one

14:49.421 --> 14:52.732
ever got anything they
really wanted in life

14:52.791 --> 14:55.362
sitting around introspecting themselves.

14:56.695 --> 15:02.145
Sometimes you have to get out
of your head and into action.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.939
Matthew Taylor,

15:05.070 --> 15:09.382
the person that you're quoting,
you're quoting Matthew Taylor.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.442
No.

15:11.677 --> 15:15.591
One can only introspect oneself,
that's what the word means.

15:16.115 --> 15:19.096
So saying introspect oneself is redundant

15:19.151 --> 15:21.028
and might suggest that
Mr. Taylor doesn't know

15:21.086 --> 15:22.966
what he is talking about
when he uses that word.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.092
Yeah, but...

15:24.156 --> 15:26.261
Secondly, he is a life coach,

15:26.325 --> 15:32.503
i.e., he has no training of any kind
in psychology or human behavior.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.840
I took his seminar last weekend

15:35.734 --> 15:37.771
- and it changed my life.
- And it might

15:37.836 --> 15:39.440
seem like that right now,

15:39.505 --> 15:44.420
but in time, I assure you that you will
realize that you wasted your money.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.955
.Really?
Yes!

15:46.545 --> 15:49.185
- Yes!
- You should try it.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.990
It might help you
pull the stick out of your ass.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.832
Oh, God! I blew that one!

16:10.703 --> 16:13.616
- Get in!
- What is this thing?

16:13.672 --> 16:16.778
Remember that professional wrestler guy
that I kind of dated and then...

16:16.842 --> 16:18.787
Oh, wait, hey, no, look,
as far as you're concerned,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.690
it doesn't matter,
this is your weekend chariot.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.558
Yeah, she is right.
Here is how it's going down,

16:23.582 --> 16:25.942
we're going to go to your house.
You have exactly 15 minutes

16:25.985 --> 16:28.522
to pack a bag and then
we are taking you away for the weekend.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.567
No is not an acceptable answer.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.296
No, we will not answer any questions,
so don't even try.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.999
Well, here...

16:36.061 --> 16:38.501
Here is for when your asshole
gets too tight for its own good.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.073
Fine, I'll take them,
but I won't take them.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.237
- Get in!
- Okay.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.953
- Ready?
- Yes.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.387
We <i>freak in</i> my jeep

16:54.446 --> 16:57.222
<i>Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo</i>

16:59.551 --> 17:02.464
<i>You could travel the world</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:04.159
<i>But nothing comes close</i>

17:04.223 --> 17:06.964
<i>To the golden coast</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:09.801
<i>Once you party with us</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:12.001
<i>You'll be falling in love</i>

17:12.064 --> 17:14.044
<i>Oooooh? Oh Oooooh?</i>

17:14.098 --> 17:16.204
<i>California girls</i>

17:16.268 --> 17:17.770
<i>We're unforgettable</i>

17:17.836 --> 17:21.443
<i>Daisy Dukes Bikinis on top</i>

17:21.507 --> 17:22.952
<i>Sun-kissed skin</i>

17:23.375 --> 17:25.320
<i>So hot we'll melt your my jeep</i>

17:25.377 --> 17:27.983
- Hey!
- Hi!

17:28.047 --> 17:29.958
- I am ready for the Gas Lamp.
- Oh!

17:30.015 --> 17:33.929
Yes, but first, we're going to do
a little personal enrichment.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.163
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.064
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.403
It's going to be really exciting.
You're going to love it.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.730
Thank you, ladies.

17:44.997 --> 17:48.308
Now, the man you've all been waiting for.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.719
<i>That guy.</i>

18:02.881 --> 18:04.292
He is gorgeous.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.661
Hello, ladies.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.940
My name is Matthew Taylor and
this is The Bounce Back!

18:20.632 --> 18:22.202
What we're going to do this weekend

18:22.267 --> 18:24.076
is delve into the strategies in creating

18:24.136 --> 18:27.379
the kind of love that
you want for your life.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.248
Oh, no! No way!
This is not happening, girls.

18:29.308 --> 18:33.120
- Hey, wait, you need to be open to this.
- How many of you are here

18:33.178 --> 18:35.021
because you've had
your heart broken recently?

18:37.216 --> 18:38.559
That's original.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.260
Okay. Do me a favor, keep your hands up

18:41.320 --> 18:43.095
until I ask you to put them down, okay?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.297
If you've had your heart broken
in the last week,

18:47.359 --> 18:48.679
go ahead and put your hands down.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.132
In the last month,

18:51.196 --> 18:53.156
if you've had
your heart broken in the last month,

18:53.198 --> 18:54.518
go ahead and put your hands down.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.311
- Six months?
- Really?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.105
How about the last two years?

19:00.639 --> 19:01.640
Three years?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.509
Five years?

19:04.176 --> 19:06.087
- Keep it up.
- I don't want to keep it up!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.620
Six years?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.018
Miss?

19:14.119 --> 19:15.120
Miss?

19:16.455 --> 19:17.456
Miss?

19:18.590 --> 19:22.163
- Would you mind stepping up to the mike?
- Oh, no, no, I am good.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.332
What's your name?

19:25.364 --> 19:26.707
Kristin Peralto.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.336
Kristin. So how long has it been, Kristin?

19:32.638 --> 19:34.640
It has been six and a half years.

19:34.706 --> 19:35.878
Oh! Ooh!

19:36.108 --> 19:39.112
Okay, okay, it's all good.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

19:39.478 --> 19:42.152
All of us here know how hard it is
to get over a relationship.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.925
Kristin, if you would humor me, step up to
the mic so everybody can hear you?

19:49.888 --> 19:51.333
I'm good. I'm good.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.370
I'm good. I'm really good.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.267
I'm good, I'm good.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.612
How many of you have heard the old saying

20:08.640 --> 20:11.120
about how long it takes
to get over a relationship?

20:11.376 --> 20:13.617
Oh, half as long as you were in it.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.956
There it is, that's the one I was looking
for, half as long as you were in it.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.017
How many of you
actually agree with that theory?

20:21.019 --> 20:22.630
Would you like to know
how long it really takes?

20:22.654 --> 20:23.860
Yes.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.898
Exactly as long as you want it to.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.536
So, Kristin,

20:32.431 --> 20:35.674
getting over a relationship
takes exactly as long as you want it to.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.543
Yeah, if it were that easy.

20:40.872 --> 20:43.648
- What do you do for a living?
- I am a therapist.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.322
So you are trained to dissect the past,

20:48.313 --> 20:51.453
to really dig into it, sift through
it in great detail, am I right?

20:51.516 --> 20:54.827
If you insist on
grossly oversimplifying it, sure.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.934
How is that working out for you?

20:58.156 --> 21:02.195
I've heard your spiel
and it sounds marvelous,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.935
who wouldn't want
to get over a painful breakup instantly?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.000
You don't.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.044
People grow real attached to their pain.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.482
It becomes a constant story
that they play back over and over again.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.651
They tell their friends, their coworkers,
their relatives,

21:16.675 --> 21:18.086
just wonk, wonk, wonk...

21:19.678 --> 21:23.387
And your friends listen to the story
and then they regurgitate it right back.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.449
Now. why?

21:25.250 --> 21:27.890
Well, it's because
this story gives you a payoff.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.729
You don't have to face the things
that you know that you should,

21:31.156 --> 21:32.396
like going to the gym.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.330
Allowing yourself to feel vulnerable
with a man,

21:38.063 --> 21:39.201
or in your case, Kristin,

21:40.666 --> 21:42.386
standing here
and listening to me right now.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.978
The problem with therapy

21:45.037 --> 21:47.847
is even once you finally
understand your pain,

21:49.374 --> 21:50.854
it doesn't really help you let it go.

21:51.109 --> 21:54.454
You... You can't just will yourself
to not feel pain.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.985
- Consider that it's possible.
- It's not. It's not possible. It's not.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.661
- Would you at least consider it?
- No.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.634
- Have... Have any of you tried it?
- Yeah.

22:05.691 --> 22:09.002
Yeah. I am sure you have, a million times.
I know I have.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.638
I wake up in the morning and I think, hey,

22:10.662 --> 22:14.371
I am feeling better
and then I go on a bad date.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.437
I go home. I watch Ice Loves Coca
and I burst into tears.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.982
Why? I have no idea why.

22:20.038 --> 22:22.712
The mind is a complete freaking mystery,

22:22.774 --> 22:25.277
which is why there are
highly trained professionals

22:25.344 --> 22:27.153
whose job it is to help.

22:27.546 --> 22:30.959
Quick fixes like yours are always a scam,

22:31.016 --> 22:35.089
whether it's a pill, a book, or a seminar.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.133
Wow! I'm sorry.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.140
Settle down. Settle down.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.440
I actually agree with Kristin
to some extent,

22:50.502 --> 22:53.176
but this seminar is not a quick fix.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.245
What we're going to do
over the next two days

22:56.308 --> 23:00.017
is give you the tools
to get over it and stay over it.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.619
Oh, my God!

23:05.517 --> 23:07.394
What was that?

23:08.053 --> 23:10.659
I'm embarrassed.
I sounded like a bitter old hag, didn't I?

23:10.722 --> 23:11.723
Totally!

23:11.790 --> 23:14.100
But in a Kristin kind of way.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.263
- Right!
- Yeah.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.131
It was good.

23:17.195 --> 23:20.665
No, look, I am sorry, you guys were trying
to do something nice and I ruined it.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.837
No, no, no, you just gave us a story

23:22.901 --> 23:26.144
that we are going to be able to tell
for years to come, okay?

23:26.204 --> 23:28.582
This is just totally worth
the price of admission.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.710
Yeah, because I paid.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.981
Really you guys aren't mad?

23:31.042 --> 23:33.215
Hell no! Chicks before dicks.

23:33.678 --> 23:34.679
Let's get out of here.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.324
No, no, no, I don't want you
to miss the rest.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.925
Oh, come on, I don't want to break this up.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.123
Yeah, yeah. Gas Lamp, bitches.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.431
Gas Lamp, bitches.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.796
Come on!

23:45.857 --> 23:47.700
- Gas Lamp, bitches.
- Gas Lamp, bitches.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.965
Let's go!

23:49.027 --> 23:51.205
- Just do it, it will make you feel better.
- Gas Lamp, bitches.

23:51.229 --> 23:52.765
- Yes!
- Yeah!

23:54.666 --> 23:56.441
I know it's going to be fun.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.780
Oh, oh, sex bomb, <i>3</i> o'clock.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.627
Would you excuse me for just a moment?

24:04.409 --> 24:05.410
Ladies!

24:06.111 --> 24:07.249
Ladies!

24:08.246 --> 24:09.366
You're not leaving, are you?

24:10.916 --> 24:13.760
I am sorry, but this just isn't our thing.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.123
It's not exactly Ice Loves Coco.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.998
Yeah. That's right.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.594
Well, I'd be more than happy
to refund your money.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.538
No, keep it.
We're going to go to the Gas Lamp

24:24.596 --> 24:26.474
to deal with our problems
the old-fashioned way.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.705
- That's right.
- She means drinking.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.041
Yeah. I think he gets it.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.274
Well, good luck with that!

24:32.971 --> 24:35.611
- I am sorry you're not staying.
- Thanks.

24:37.742 --> 24:39.050
Bye.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.622
I am really sorry
about what happened over there.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.698
Hey!

24:50.021 --> 24:51.056
So who read the book?

24:51.122 --> 24:55.036
- He was staring at your ass so hard!
- Oh, please! No!

24:55.093 --> 24:56.731
No, he looks at every woman like that.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.002
Believe me, I know that kind of guy.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.880
Okay. Really, what do you think
of Matthew Taylor?

25:05.904 --> 25:07.611
He is hot. I will give him that,

25:07.672 --> 25:09.674
but that's exactly my point.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.414
If he looked like Dr. Phil,

25:11.476 --> 25:15.049
he wouldn't have a gaggle of
fawning bimbos hanging on his every word.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.093
Yeah, but that's just the way
the world works.

25:17.148 --> 25:18.821
That doesn't make it right.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.488
Well, it doesn't make it wrong either.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.497
I mean, you are doing the same thing
as these bimbos,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.228
you're judging the book by its cover.

25:26.925 --> 25:30.771
Is this a book about relationships
or a swimsuit calendar?

25:30.829 --> 25:32.365
Does anyone really care?

25:32.898 --> 25:34.571
You guys are hopeless.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.772
No! We are celebrating.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.809
Hold on! This could be a client.

25:42.741 --> 25:43.742
Hello?

25:44.843 --> 25:45.844
Yes.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.684
When?

26:00.358 --> 26:02.269
Uh-oh! He is honking for you.
You better hurry.

26:04.262 --> 26:05.832
- Love you, babe.
- Love you.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.244
Move your butt, slowpoke.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.883
Dad, you really need to get a girlfriend.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.652
Excuse you?

26:22.514 --> 26:23.515
And why is that?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.354
I don't know, even out the scores.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.497
Mom has George.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.763
You should meet him.

26:34.092 --> 26:38.006
Aleya, why would I want to meet George?

26:38.697 --> 26:40.643
He is a nice guy, you would like him.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.505
- You like him a lot, huh?
- Yeah, he is good for Mom.

26:49.074 --> 26:52.419
Sorry. Does that make you feel bad?

26:53.712 --> 26:55.214
It's complicated, sweetheart.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.859
I've heard that one before.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.703
I promise you will understand
when you get older.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.223
Oh, my God!

27:02.287 --> 27:04.198
Now I have really heard that one before.

27:04.255 --> 27:07.668
Okay! You know what,
can you stay a little girl

27:07.726 --> 27:09.637
just a little while longer, please?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.406
You are such a busybody.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.203
Wow!

27:20.672 --> 27:24.916
- Speedy! What's the rush?
- No rush, I just don't want to miss him.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.315
Miss him? Him who?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.818
Come on, Dad.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.985
Come on, Dad, nothing. Miss who?

27:31.049 --> 27:32.653
Hey! Who is him?

27:32.717 --> 27:35.596
Nice, man! I see you out there.
Keep that up.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.797
Maybe I can show you a thing or two.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.667
Aleya! Hey!

27:43.261 --> 27:45.366
Oh, hey! What's up?

27:45.797 --> 27:47.708
You know, the same old shit.

27:48.566 --> 27:49.636
Is that your dad?

27:51.036 --> 27:52.845
Uh, yeah.

27:52.904 --> 27:54.611
Oh! Cool!

27:54.973 --> 27:56.509
Hello. I'm Jeff.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.112
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.615
Uh, you wanted to go to the Gap, right?

28:03.381 --> 28:04.382
Hmm?

28:04.449 --> 28:06.053
Oh, right, right, the Gap.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.522
Yeah, Gap.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.198
Dad needs some new V-necks.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.701
Okay. I will meet you over there
in a couple of minutes.

28:13.558 --> 28:14.559
Okay.

28:15.326 --> 28:17.829
Well, it was nice to meet you, Jeff.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.711
Hmm? Yeah?

28:24.169 --> 28:25.170
No?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.206
Okay.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.084
I am sorry about that.

28:34.846 --> 28:35.881
It's cool.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.461
T, how did we get two segments?

28:42.887 --> 28:46.164
Hey. Don't worry about that.
We are on our way.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.502
You just make sure you go out there
and you don't screw this up.

28:48.526 --> 28:50.699
Thanks! I appreciate the pep talk.

28:50.929 --> 28:53.432
Live Night is a great look for us,

28:53.498 --> 28:56.479
but this Lindsay McCormick chick
is unpredictable.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.514
But her show is national.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.743
That means you've got
to be ready for anything, man!

29:00.805 --> 29:02.910
Like what, man?
What, a paternity test? Come on!

29:02.974 --> 29:05.818
It's not a joke, okay.
You've got two segments.

29:05.877 --> 29:08.483
I need you to nail both of them. Okay?

29:08.546 --> 29:10.548
Show them that we are good television.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.821
Who is them?

29:11.883 --> 29:14.625
The powers that be, the audience,
the world!

29:14.686 --> 29:17.166
Oh, T, T, T, you know,
you are being paranoid.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.265
Everything is going to be fine.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.101
I am going to walk out there
and I am going to do my thing.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.366
And what happens when I do my thing?
It never fails.

29:22.427 --> 29:26.307
Yeah, but what if she says, "Why isn't
the relationship expert in a relationship?"

29:26.364 --> 29:28.275
Uh? Yeah, fix your face.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.177
You better get me one of these chairs
for my birthday, seriously.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.812
There is like three Thai ladies in here.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.416
Ah!

29:42.413 --> 29:46.259
I am Lindsay McCormick,
and this is Live Night!

29:47.986 --> 29:51.229
We are back with Matthew Taylor,
author of The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:53.394
- Matthew!
- Hey! Talk to me girl.

29:53.458 --> 29:58.168
I loved your book.
There is really no other way to say that.

29:58.363 --> 30:01.003
But reading it
was like a relationship bitch slap.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.871
- What inspired this book, a broken heart?
- Yeah... Oh, yeah.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.383
I was in a 10-year marriage
that just went wrong.

30:09.207 --> 30:11.327
What I'd like to say,
and I say it in The Bounce <i>Back,</i>

30:11.676 --> 30:14.555
is to consider that the past doesn't exist.

30:15.079 --> 30:18.959
See, what I focused on is creating
new possibilities for your future

30:19.017 --> 30:21.088
and how you can live into that future.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.129
It took me a while to hone
that thoroughbred that you see right there.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.603
- Is that right?
- Damn straight!

30:28.726 --> 30:31.764
It's kind of like the man
behind the man situation,

30:31.830 --> 30:33.571
you know me, I am Terry Jackson.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.409
I know who you are.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.171
I booked you for the show.

30:37.235 --> 30:39.374
Oh! I thought Jerry booked us
for the show.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.348
He did, he works for me.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.544
Oh, okay.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.484
- Anyone?
- Confident.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.148
Confident, okay. How about over here?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.287
I didn't see you down at the seminar.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.124
Oh, well, you should have told me
you were coming to the seminar,

30:53.184 --> 30:54.891
I would have set things up for you, baby.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.934
You know, got your full access passes
and everything.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.309
Yeah, I would like to do
my own research though, thank you.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.129
How many had a vision of someone?

31:04.395 --> 31:07.774
Now, I am not saying that you are or you
are not going to end up with this man,

31:07.832 --> 31:08.833
but...

31:09.701 --> 31:11.180
An idea when flamed

31:12.570 --> 31:13.674
might just catch fire.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.278
And to catch that kind of fire,

31:17.342 --> 31:20.755
you all need to go out and
buy a copy of The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

31:24.449 --> 31:26.952
Okay, we like to look at all sides
here on Live Night,

31:27.018 --> 31:28.622
so let's bring out our next guest.

31:28.686 --> 31:31.166
She is a licensed clinical psychologist,

31:31.222 --> 31:33.668
Kristin Peralto. Come on down, girl!

31:37.128 --> 31:38.630
So what's going on?

31:39.497 --> 31:41.340
The same thing that went down
at the seminar.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.311
<i>Kristin, you specialize
in love and relationships.</i>

31:44.369 --> 31:45.746
Wait a minute!

31:45.803 --> 31:47.646
You don't agree with Matthew's assertions.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.480
No, I don't.

31:49.540 --> 31:53.818
Mr. Taylor and people of his ilk
are charlatans.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.380
Oh!

31:55.880 --> 31:59.089
Meaning they have very good intuition
about what makes people tick,

31:59.150 --> 32:00.823
about what people want to hear,

32:00.885 --> 32:02.865
and what's going to
make people feel better

32:02.921 --> 32:05.595
about themselves, at least temporarily.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.967
And what's so wrong with that?

32:09.794 --> 32:12.832
Well, self-help gurus like you

32:12.897 --> 32:16.174
sell a magical elixir
that's going to lead to lifelong happiness

32:16.234 --> 32:20.444
without any work or sacrifice
and that's a sham.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.644
It's just not possible.

32:22.707 --> 32:26.348
And the only reason people are willing to
believe you is because they are vulnerable.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.113
What the hell are you up to?

32:28.880 --> 32:32.418
Just what she said,
presenting both sides of the argument.

32:32.750 --> 32:37.028
No, no, no, no, argument,
no one is having an argument with nobody.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.089
Trust me.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.466
I just did you a big favor.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.835
No, you trust me,
I'm going to talk to your boss

32:42.894 --> 32:46.000
and this is not the last time
you will see me, trust me.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.775
See, when I was in therapy,

32:47.799 --> 32:50.006
the conversation
was always about the process,

32:50.835 --> 32:52.712
the road you're going to have to endure

32:53.204 --> 32:54.949
and how you have to grieve
in order to move forward,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.180
but see my book
The Bounce <i>Back</i> isn't about grieving,

32:58.409 --> 32:59.410
it's about creating.

32:59.944 --> 33:03.289
That's because you're unwilling
to face uncomfortable truths.

33:05.216 --> 33:07.127
Well, here is the truth, as I know it.

33:07.785 --> 33:11.232
I have tried it your way,
it just didn't work for me,

33:11.923 --> 33:13.334
so I developed my own way,

33:13.391 --> 33:15.803
maybe you should give it a try
as a professional courtesy.

33:17.395 --> 33:20.706
If you are implying that
we're in the same profession, we are not.

33:20.965 --> 33:25.345
My job as a therapist is to increase
the individual sense of well-being,

33:25.403 --> 33:29.146
not to fill their heads with fantasies
about the rippling abs in their future

33:29.207 --> 33:30.880
that's what E.L James is for.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.952
All right, well that's the perfect place
to cut this off.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.722
Thank you Matthew Taylor
and Kristin Peralto,

33:38.783 --> 33:40.285
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

33:55.566 --> 33:56.909
So, where's the other guy?

33:56.968 --> 33:58.845
He didn't seem too happy.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.006
He wasn't.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.109
They told me to let you have it.

34:04.675 --> 34:06.086
Don't think I got that memo.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.356
Look, that really sucked.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.764
Um, I am not a bad person really.

34:19.524 --> 34:22.402
Can I buy you a coffee? Truce?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.033
Let's make it a drink.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.310
Yeah, we can get a drink.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.348
<i>When in Home, huh?</i>

34:37.641 --> 34:39.178
I highly doubt the Romans drank that.

34:40.545 --> 34:43.321
Is that what you studied at, uh, hmm...

34:43.380 --> 34:47.226
What's that school you went to again,
that school?

34:47.284 --> 34:48.286
Subtle.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.665
Sports Science at Georgetown
and then Law at UCLA,

34:51.722 --> 34:53.201
I was on track to be a sports agent.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.668
So you were a jock in college?

34:55.726 --> 34:57.171
Says the drama student.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.839
Drama is very therapeutic. Thank you!

35:00.298 --> 35:01.868
And how do you know I was in drama?

35:01.933 --> 35:03.344
Psychic abilities.

35:03.701 --> 35:06.462
Just because you have a voice
in your head doesn't make you a psychic.

35:08.739 --> 35:11.418
Do you ever wonder why that voice
in your head is usually very negative?

35:11.442 --> 35:15.788
Well, there is never a single reason why.
There's always some underlying

35:15.847 --> 35:17.656
personal Night is at work.

35:19.717 --> 35:20.718
Okay.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.399
What if you could control that voice?

35:24.355 --> 35:25.993
You can't control your subconscious.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.666
That is true,
but you can choose to listen to it

35:28.726 --> 35:30.569
when it's good and ignore it when it's bad.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.671
Okay. How?

35:33.264 --> 35:34.902
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.173
- I don't think you mean it.
- No, I do.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.247
- No, you don't.
- Don't tell me what I mean.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.620
I actually want to know how.

35:45.009 --> 35:47.649
It would be very helpful for me
to ignore the voice in my head.

35:54.919 --> 35:55.989
You are terrible!

35:56.053 --> 35:57.760
- Just read it.
- Never!

35:57.822 --> 35:59.893
- That hurts!
- Good!

36:02.093 --> 36:05.734
If I am bored out of my
mind, I'll consider.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.733
You have really beautiful eyes,
you know that?

36:14.672 --> 36:15.707
Sorry!

36:17.608 --> 36:18.609
Hello!

36:18.676 --> 36:20.485
What the hell is this?

36:21.412 --> 36:22.618
An apology drink.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.226
Apology-

36:26.751 --> 36:28.753
- Really?
- You're crazy, Matthew!

36:29.387 --> 36:33.130
That's crazy, I guess.
I don't know, should I?

36:35.126 --> 36:37.936
Producers at The Chat just called.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.303
- Are you serious?
- Yup!

36:39.764 --> 36:40.868
That's a good thing, right?

36:41.632 --> 36:43.771
- They want the two of you.
- They do?

36:44.302 --> 36:45.406
Why not?

36:45.469 --> 36:49.246
I'll tell you why not, message confusion.
We have a brand.

36:49.307 --> 36:53.221
We can't be out here presenting it and let
Ms. Fire-Breather try and burn it down.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.114
- She is right there.
- I don't care!

36:56.514 --> 37:00.826
Hey, are you guys doing this?
It's kind of a big deal, right?

37:01.385 --> 37:02.591
No, we're not doing it.

37:04.088 --> 37:05.761
Um, they're not doing it.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.201
- How come?
- Because we don't like you.

37:09.493 --> 37:10.597
Okay.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.669
- He doesn't mean that like...
- Yes, I do! Don't lie.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.335
No, I don't.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.474
Did you hear that?

37:19.003 --> 37:20.107
Hold on!

37:21.372 --> 37:22.544
Ah!

37:22.607 --> 37:23.608
Hello!

37:24.175 --> 37:25.279
No, we're not doing it.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.050
I know who you are...

37:27.612 --> 37:30.786
Why? Because we don't know
who she is, do you?

37:31.115 --> 37:33.425
Does she have any lawsuits out there
for malpractice?

37:33.484 --> 37:35.020
She is a therapist, not an MD.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.363
Look, we have the best-selling book
in the country.

37:38.856 --> 37:41.427
Yes, and she is just
a venom-spewing hatemonger

37:41.492 --> 37:44.283
trying to tap my
client's celebrity status.

37:44.308 --> 37:45.259
Excuse me?

37:45.296 --> 37:47.333
Nobody is tapping anybody.
He is just talking.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.605
- You heard me.
- Why don't you tell those D-list

37:49.667 --> 37:52.079
pop psychologists
that I took it easy on them,

37:52.136 --> 37:54.480
and if they ever have the balls
to face me again,

37:54.538 --> 37:59.419
I will expose their fortune cookie theories
and the napkin they thought it all up on.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.581
Okay, guys, seriously.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.784
- Fortune cookie?
- Fortune cookie!

38:02.847 --> 38:05.828
You know what, your talk show days
are over anyway, Ms. Lady!

38:05.883 --> 38:08.295
- Great! Wonderful!
- Fantastic!

38:08.352 --> 38:11.196
I can't believe I spent $35
on two stupid drinks.

38:11.522 --> 38:14.128
- I'll take care of it.
- Don't you dare!

38:14.191 --> 38:16.193
Oh, we dare! We dare!

38:16.260 --> 38:19.036
- You get off! You get off it!
- Let go!

38:19.664 --> 38:21.302
We dare the most!

38:21.999 --> 38:24.809
All right.
Get out of here as quickly as possible.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.250
You are a true gentleman!

38:30.608 --> 38:33.987
Oh, you've got your credit card on you?
I'll pay you back.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.252
You know I am good.
Come on, man. Stop playing.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.850
I got it! I got...

38:56.033 --> 38:58.604
<i>"How To Grow Your Business Today"?</i>

39:00.104 --> 39:01.208
Stupid!

39:10.548 --> 39:11.549
Really?

39:24.595 --> 39:26.632
Not so cute anymore, huh, Matthew Taylor.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.807
Bounce back from this!

39:39.310 --> 39:40.311
Hi.

39:41.245 --> 39:42.246
Um...

39:43.280 --> 39:44.816
We know each other.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.896
It's a really long story.

39:52.089 --> 39:53.090
I'll get this.

40:10.674 --> 40:11.675
Hey, there.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.190
Hey, Julie.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.319
She is going to be a few.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.988
Do you want to come inside for a minute?

40:21.051 --> 40:22.086
Oh!

40:22.553 --> 40:24.794
I'm fine. Thanks. I'm okay.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.859
George and I
started reading The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

40:29.360 --> 40:30.930
Matthew, it's really great!

40:31.295 --> 40:34.299
I can see why you're having
so much success with it.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.837
You know, you should really talk to him.
I think that you...

40:37.902 --> 40:38.972
Oh! No.

40:40.771 --> 40:41.772
I'm fine.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.615
It's okay, but thank you though.

40:48.979 --> 40:52.552
Well, I just wanted you to know
that you are always welcome.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.652
Thank you.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.125
Bye!

41:02.293 --> 41:03.363
Take care.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.463
- Hey, babe!
- Hi!

41:05.596 --> 41:06.836
Have fun, okay?

41:06.897 --> 41:08.843
- Love you.
- I love you too.

41:08.899 --> 41:10.310
Hey, short stuff.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.480
Hi, Dad.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.344
Here, give me that.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.079
Are you ready?

41:23.447 --> 41:24.687
I need a favor.

41:26.851 --> 41:27.989
Uh-oh!

41:54.144 --> 41:55.623
- Hey.
- What's up?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
What's up, man?

42:24.708 --> 42:27.018
- What are you doing?
- I'm drinking, man, I'm drinking.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.917
That's what I'm doing.
I'm getting my drink on.

42:29.780 --> 42:32.351
Come on, Terry.
It was great television, let it go.

42:32.416 --> 42:33.622
Look, I'm sorry, man.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.158
I'm just emotional right now.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.394
You do know it's still daytime
, you might want to slow that down.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.336
Oh! Look,

42:42.059 --> 42:44.164
when we started,
we had a vision, you and me.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.072
You are Durant, I am Westbrook, right?

42:47.131 --> 42:48.508
Yeah, and we still are.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.834
- I just feel like I let you down.
- Terry, what are you talking about?

42:53.337 --> 42:55.977
<i>The producers of Entertainment Tonight
called today.</i>

42:56.040 --> 42:57.519
Okay. And?

42:57.575 --> 42:58.815
They want you in the show.

42:59.276 --> 43:03.247
You know, how this thing works, you know,
nothing gets a crowd like a crowd,

43:03.314 --> 43:07.319
you get ET, the next thing you know,
Love Nation is calling.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.788
That is great news! What is the problem?

43:10.754 --> 43:13.963
They want you on the show, with her.

43:16.860 --> 43:20.034
It's not funny, man. What's so funny?

43:21.865 --> 43:24.402
All right. So just call her and apologize.

43:24.468 --> 43:26.588
- It's not that simple.
- She wouldn't take your call?

43:28.072 --> 43:29.683
Did Kristin said she wouldn't talk to me?

43:29.707 --> 43:34.213
That woman is not talking to either of us,
even if we pay her, because I tried that.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.855
I thought you just said
she wouldn't take your call.

43:35.879 --> 43:38.189
I emailed her, hit her on Facebook.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.694
I liked all her pictures
on Instagram, nothing.

43:40.751 --> 43:43.197
Hit her on Pinterest, Linkedln.

43:43.253 --> 43:45.790
I went to every Starbucks
that a chick would hang out,

43:45.856 --> 43:48.427
because every chick hangs out
at Starbucks for the free Wi-Fi.

43:48.492 --> 43:49.630
She wasn't there either.

43:49.693 --> 43:52.264
I can't do anything else, Matthew.

43:52.329 --> 43:54.275
I mean, I don't even know
where her mother lives.

43:54.331 --> 43:56.140
I don't know her family like that.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.374
I mean, I don't know what else I could do.
I mean, does she have a blog?

44:09.680 --> 44:10.954
Matthew Right.

44:12.282 --> 44:14.284
Communicate, associate, empathize...

44:22.760 --> 44:26.071
- This is a good book.
- You need to leave. I have an appointment.

44:29.199 --> 44:32.373
With me.
You have an appointment with me.

44:33.437 --> 44:34.507
Mr. Right.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.118
I get it, ha-ha, very funny.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.519
- Can you just give me five minutes?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

44:39.543 --> 44:42.683
You're a therapist, right?
I'm a patient in need.

44:43.947 --> 44:45.358
Just five minutes.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.860
You're paying for 50, put the book down.

44:54.958 --> 44:56.164
I'm listening.

44:58.295 --> 45:00.707
Terry was wrong and foolish.

45:01.865 --> 45:04.072
He just... He gets very protective,

45:05.536 --> 45:08.915
but frankly, sometimes he's got
his foot stuck so far up his...

45:08.972 --> 45:10.007
Turn around please.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.484
I am here to ask you
to do the show with us.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.993
Give me one good reason.

45:20.718 --> 45:21.822
I'll give you millions.

45:26.123 --> 45:29.161
That's <i>how</i> many <i>people</i>
watch <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

45:30.027 --> 45:32.564
Come on, imagine the opportunity
to help all those people!

45:32.629 --> 45:35.371
People aren't helped one iota
by mass market sound bites.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.210
The appearance fees can be kind of nice.

45:39.269 --> 45:41.545
Helping people
also isn't about making money.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.750
Look,

45:49.346 --> 45:52.122
I am going on television
with or without you,

45:53.016 --> 45:56.088
and me and my mass market sound bites
are all they're going to hear.

45:56.153 --> 45:57.996
Why do you care so much if I come?

45:58.856 --> 46:01.063
People deserve a balanced perspective,

46:03.494 --> 46:04.495
and I like you.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.096
Excuse me?

46:06.630 --> 46:09.133
I do. I enjoy talking to you

46:10.267 --> 46:11.746
and enjoy being around you.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.403
I want to do the show with you
because I think it would be good for us,

46:15.739 --> 46:17.499
and I think it would be
good for you, and...

46:20.210 --> 46:22.087
I can't stop looking at your eyes.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.385
Really?

46:25.716 --> 46:28.424
If someone is going to rip me to shreds
on national television,

46:30.454 --> 46:31.865
I'd like it to be you.

46:33.924 --> 46:34.994
Say yes.

46:40.063 --> 46:42.543
<i>The best-selling book
bouncing across the country</i>

46:42.599 --> 46:46.741
and two celebrity experts,
with two very different opinions,

46:46.804 --> 46:50.183
we're going to be speaking
with Matthew Taylor and Kristin Peralto

46:50.240 --> 46:52.481
right after this,
the team behind The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

46:52.543 --> 46:54.921
- Cut!
- I know, do it again.

46:54.978 --> 46:55.979
Okay.

46:58.015 --> 47:00.859
The best-selling book bouncing across
the country...

47:00.918 --> 47:02.522
- What?
- Yeah, right.

47:02.586 --> 47:04.998
- Now she is a part of the team?
- Terry!

47:05.322 --> 47:07.928
How did you get her to do it anyway?
Did you hit it?

47:07.991 --> 47:09.629
- No.
- Did you get up in them jeans?

47:09.693 --> 47:10.933
No, come on, man, stop!

47:10.994 --> 47:12.701
- Look at me.
- I am looking right at you.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.106
Now, stop, Terry, no.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.533
Man!

47:19.970 --> 47:21.711
I am sorry about that. He is, uh...

47:22.840 --> 47:24.751
He is just really nervous
about this press tour.

47:24.808 --> 47:26.651
You know I am going
to rip you apart, right?

47:28.045 --> 47:29.046
Bring it.

47:29.746 --> 47:32.090
<i>Welcome to Entertainment Tonight!
Lam</i> Rocsi <i>Diaz,</i>

47:32.149 --> 47:36.291
and today, we're talking to Matthew Taylor
about his controversial new book.

47:36.353 --> 47:39.425
That is a very dangerous perspective
if you don't take into consideration...

47:39.489 --> 47:40.968
What the hell is she talking about?

47:41.024 --> 47:43.561
First of all, she called him
a charlatan on TV, dawg.

47:43.627 --> 47:46.130
I need to talk to my client.
Hey, hey, hey, okay.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.882
That's not realistic.

47:56.940 --> 47:59.386
She calls my philosophy a scam,
I call it a belief.

47:59.443 --> 48:02.981
The payoff can't be achieved
through a magical elixir.

48:05.549 --> 48:09.087
Stop it. I am going to take as much
as I feel like taking.

48:12.322 --> 48:13.767
Oh, my God!

48:25.869 --> 48:27.576
I promise you, read the book.

48:27.638 --> 48:30.050
You can't promise somebody a happy...

48:30.107 --> 48:32.109
I am all about living a happier life.

48:32.476 --> 48:36.822
Today we're here with Matthew Taylor,
the author of The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

48:36.880 --> 48:38.524
Well, my book has sold millions of copies.

48:38.548 --> 48:40.660
Well, I think that's because
you're a very good-looking guy.

48:40.684 --> 48:43.084
That's the first time
she has actually given me a compliment.

48:47.824 --> 48:49.929
Are you okay?

48:49.993 --> 48:51.495
No, no, no.

48:52.429 --> 48:53.430
Peace.

48:54.097 --> 48:55.132
- No.
- It's perfect.

48:55.198 --> 48:56.768
- No, this is terrible.
- No.

48:56.833 --> 49:00.212
How is that
something that you could actually sell?

49:01.104 --> 49:03.880
Let's read the book together, okay.
Let's just try.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.221
This is a train wreck right now.

49:16.987 --> 49:19.991
Come on.
I know Kristin loves 40 questions, right?

49:20.057 --> 49:22.230
Come on! No.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.946
Come on, admit it.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.954
- Come on! This is fun.
- It's not.

49:43.013 --> 49:46.688
- Kristin, this is fun.
- I am not having fun. Stop it.

49:47.517 --> 49:48.894
Just say it.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.830
- Fine, I am having fun.
- Oh, there we go.

50:25.255 --> 50:26.256
Hi.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.667
Come to the window, why?

50:41.238 --> 50:42.444
Hey. you. What's up?

50:42.539 --> 50:43.677
What are you doing here?

50:44.441 --> 50:46.853
I was kind of thinking we could go out,
get a bite to eat.

50:47.677 --> 50:48.985
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.020
Go put something cute on, let's go.

50:54.818 --> 50:55.956
Okay.

51:13.203 --> 51:14.648
You look beautiful!

51:14.704 --> 51:16.115
You look ridiculous.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.460
You're going to wanna put one on, trust me.

51:19.476 --> 51:21.353
I have to say I'm impressed.

51:22.045 --> 51:25.515
I am impressed with how open you've been to
such a radically different point of view.

51:25.882 --> 51:28.282
It says a lot about how much
you believe in your methodology.

51:28.518 --> 51:31.089
Oh. Somebody's been reading my book.

51:31.154 --> 51:33.259
- No.
- Oh! Come on now, tell the truth!

51:34.524 --> 51:35.867
I read the introduction.

51:36.359 --> 51:37.463
And?

51:37.961 --> 51:40.498
- Not terrible.
- I will take it. I will take it.

51:42.299 --> 51:43.972
All right, here we go. Thank you.

51:45.869 --> 51:47.013
You're okay with this, right?

51:47.037 --> 51:49.574
For your information, I love ribs.

51:50.507 --> 51:52.027
How did you find out about this place?

51:52.576 --> 51:54.351
An old friend introduced me to this joint.

51:54.611 --> 51:56.454
Old flame more like it, I'll bet.

51:58.615 --> 52:02.085
Ooh. It was an old flame, wasn't it?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.531
It was my ex-wife actually.

52:05.755 --> 52:06.927
Did she break your heart?

52:07.457 --> 52:09.869
Let's just say I lost my faith in love.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.607
- Don't tell me she wasn't faithful?
- No, no.

52:14.064 --> 52:15.805
She woke up one morning

52:16.600 --> 52:19.604
and she decided she was
absolutely sure she wasn't in love with me.

52:19.870 --> 52:21.042
That sucks.

52:21.104 --> 52:24.085
We must have said those three little words
to each other like 1,000 times.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.942
All of a sudden it was like
it never happened.

52:27.210 --> 52:28.484
How did that make you feel?

52:32.415 --> 52:36.363
I was consumed with it. I didn't eat.
I didn't sleep. I didn't do anything,

52:37.287 --> 52:40.825
until one day I said screw it,
enough is enough.

52:41.191 --> 52:43.137
I am not going to let love on me like that.

52:43.894 --> 52:45.498
It's time for me to take control.

52:46.263 --> 52:47.974
And that's where the concept
of creating the love

52:47.998 --> 52:50.808
that I want for myself
and my life came from.

52:52.135 --> 52:54.638
There, doesn't that feel better?

52:56.139 --> 52:59.245
That's processing. That's therapy.

53:02.512 --> 53:06.289
Okay. That was pretty good.
You got me, I'll give you that.

53:07.417 --> 53:08.862
Tell me everything about your ex.

53:09.119 --> 53:10.154
I would rather not.

53:10.220 --> 53:11.995
Oh! Come on now, let's process together.

53:12.322 --> 53:14.700
I have talked about it enough
for one lifetime.

53:15.258 --> 53:17.568
<i>That is The Bounce Back.</i>

53:19.362 --> 53:20.602
Let's eat.

53:25.101 --> 53:26.409
All right! Be careful.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.044
That's amazing!

53:29.206 --> 53:30.344
That is sexy

53:32.075 --> 53:33.179
and way too cute.

53:38.381 --> 53:39.883
So pretty!

53:40.750 --> 53:42.127
- You like it?
- Yeah.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.825
I think of it as my
little oasis in the sea.

53:48.792 --> 53:50.203
I like these lights.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.368
That's my little angel, her name's Aleya.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.601
- She is beautiful.
- Yeah.

53:56.666 --> 53:58.373
I like her hair.

53:59.169 --> 54:01.877
That little lady has saved me
more times than I care to admit.

54:04.307 --> 54:05.718
She is something else.

54:14.618 --> 54:15.824
What are you thinking about?

54:18.221 --> 54:19.825
- Nothing.
- Come on.

54:20.190 --> 54:22.192
I know something when I see something,
spit it out.

54:22.993 --> 54:23.994
- Nothing.
- Kristin?

54:24.060 --> 54:26.131
- What?
- Don't think I didn't notice that you

54:26.196 --> 54:28.540
sidestepped that whole conversation
about your ex.

54:29.566 --> 54:30.601
God.

54:32.302 --> 54:33.508
Do I have to?

54:39.909 --> 54:42.446
I was sure that it was
going to last forever,

54:43.213 --> 54:47.753
just like my parents,
almost 50 years and counting.

54:49.252 --> 54:52.995
And I loved him more than anything

54:55.025 --> 54:57.096
and I was sure that he loved me

54:57.927 --> 54:58.928
but

55:00.096 --> 55:01.370
I was wrong.

55:01.498 --> 55:04.411
I literally could not have been more wrong.

55:04.501 --> 55:05.502
What happened?

55:06.670 --> 55:07.910
I am sure you can guess.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.176
I'm sorry.

55:12.542 --> 55:16.854
That image of him and that person

55:18.682 --> 55:19.820
it's, um,

55:21.484 --> 55:23.691
it's printed in my brain.

55:28.024 --> 55:30.144
It takes up a whole lot of space up there,
doesn't it?

55:31.561 --> 55:35.407
And I am sure you are the guy who is just
going to come and make it all go away?

55:36.132 --> 55:37.440
Do you want me to?

56:44.300 --> 56:46.837
Oh, okay, okay, I am sorry.

56:48.204 --> 56:50.480
What? What?

56:51.307 --> 56:52.752
I have to go to the bathroom,

56:54.144 --> 56:55.145
just for a minute.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.519
- Okay.
- Okay?

56:56.579 --> 56:58.490
- Where is it?
- Right there.

56:58.548 --> 56:59.618
Okay.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.525
- All right. Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.

57:04.287 --> 57:05.630
Oh, wow.

57:07.624 --> 57:11.037
Just calm down, just calm down,
calm down.

57:12.262 --> 57:15.266
Six years, this is a good thing,

57:15.331 --> 57:18.676
this is a good thing,
you deserve this, you want this.

57:27.944 --> 57:29.924
Disgusting. Ugh.

57:42.425 --> 57:43.426
It's show time.

58:04.781 --> 58:05.919
Oh, wow.

58:10.887 --> 58:13.299
I don't ever want to forget this moment.

58:17.560 --> 58:18.630
You won't.

58:43.486 --> 58:45.488
- What's wrong?
- Mmm.

58:46.089 --> 58:47.500
Nothing at all.

58:51.294 --> 58:52.773
I feel amazing.

58:54.564 --> 58:55.872
You look amazing.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.525
What is so funny?

59:12.782 --> 59:14.318
Nothing, I just...

59:14.951 --> 59:16.726
I just feel...

59:18.821 --> 59:19.959
Phew.

59:23.192 --> 59:25.866
Oh, my God, you smell so good.

59:27.263 --> 59:28.765
You always smell so good.

59:30.300 --> 59:32.246
It's one thing I've noticed about you,

59:34.270 --> 59:38.946
and your abs, especially your abs,

59:40.276 --> 59:41.584
look at you.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.558
You should be in a Bowflex commercial.

59:44.614 --> 59:45.820
Okay. Um.

59:46.683 --> 59:47.923
What has gotten into you?

59:48.184 --> 59:49.959
Hopefully you in a few more minutes.

59:51.187 --> 59:52.894
Okay.

59:52.956 --> 59:54.458
Okay. Hey, hey, hey, Kristin.

59:54.524 --> 59:56.026
- Kristin, hey, Kristin.
- Yeah.

59:56.092 --> 59:59.266
Look at me. Are you on something?

59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.869
Sarah gave me some Bowflex Willys.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.873
What kind of Bowflex Willys?

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.909
Happy Bowflex Willys.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:09.674
I feel so good. Oh, my God!

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.786
But not as good as you're about
to make me feel.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:15.379
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:20.827
It's been six years of celibacy
and six years of celibacy

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.521
can make a woman feel like stone,

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:25.088
but I am not made of stone.

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:29.435
- Hopefully one of us...
- Okay. Oh, wow!

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.438
Okay, hey, um,

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.905
I don't know if this is such a good idea.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.035
Oh, my God! You're so strong.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.278
Just grab me, just like really tight.

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:43.044
Tarzan meet Jane.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:44.346
Wooh!

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.887
Okay. Hey, look at you. Whoa, you okay?

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.355
Okay, um, you know,

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:52.359
maybe you should just
lay down for a second, what do you think?

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:55.259
No! I am not gonna lay down.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.288
I am gonna take this bra.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:58.923
- Okay, hey, hey, hey.
- What?

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.633
I don't know
if you should do that right now.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.866
Come on, as soon as I get this off
we're about to get to business.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.201
Kristin?

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.106
Kristin?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.693
Matthew?

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.810
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:49.842
Thanks.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.514
Did we?

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.547
No.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.950
- Not even a little bit.
- Hmm.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.689
I slept on the couch.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.086
Hmm.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.389
Did you take some kind of
medication or something?

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.496
My girlfriend gave me a...

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:09.995
Oh, my God.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.868
I ruined it, didn't I?

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:17.177
You called me Tarzan.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.680
And you did quite the Jane impression.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:22.442
I mean, it was sexy, I am not going to lie,

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:26.282
but you were a little out of control,
but it was definitely sexy.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.617
Is there something I should know?

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.855
Uh-uh. I mean...

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.592
I am not on drugs or anything,
if that's what you mean.

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.590
- Okay.
- Uh-uh.

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.099
So then what, what is it then?

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.299
Tell me about this,

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.235
I am sure there is a wonderful story
behind it.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.802
It represents my pride,

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.207
protection.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:56.542
What is it protecting?

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:59.612
Me.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.724
Was it too soon?

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.458
No, too soon, why?

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:15.525
It's a big deal.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.133
- Are you nervous?
- Hmm?

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.733
No.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.077
You don't have to be nervous at all.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.441
Trust me, my little girl
has been bugging me

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.580
to get myself a girlfriend
for as long as I can remember.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.912
Really?

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.319
She is gonna be ecstatic to meet you,
don't worry about it.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.144
Okay.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.255
You are nervous. Look at you.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.451
- I am.
- That's cute.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.085
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.651
Hey, you.

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:46.396
So, um, did you see Jeff today?

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.669
Um, he went with his friends.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:50.931
Anyway.-

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.397
Well, Aleya.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:56.743
Hi, Aleya! I am your dad's, uh, friend

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:59.006
- and I'm Kristin.
- Kristin, right?

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:00.746
I have seen you guys on TV together.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.477
You have? Wow.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.178
Okay, well, um, it's
really nice to meet you.

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.244
So are you my dad's girlfriend?

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.880
Oh, whoa, whoa, hey, hey Aleya!

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:12.154
Seriously, if you like him
please be his girlfriend,

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.354
he needs one badly.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.377
You know I am standing right here,
I can hear you.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.557
All right! Anyway, um,

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.661
well, I was thinking we could all go get
a little frozen yogurt or something.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.530
Why don't you go get some frozen yogurt

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.037
and, um, we'll go shopping

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.541
and you can tell me all about your dad,

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.044
and I'd love to hear all about Jeff,

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.380
I'll keep it between you and me.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.573
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.013
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.607
What is happening right now?

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.079
We're going shopping.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.175
- Okay.
- Bye!

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:49.325
And then she got this
skirt that has these studs on it.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.864
It looks so good on her.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.397
It better not be short, okay?

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.422
It's not.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.500
None of these short shorts,
you hear me, young lady?

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.764
It's all right.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.176
Dad, I like her. Don't mess this up.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.179
Okay, you know what,
get your little butt in the house.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.236
Okay.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.220
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, let me help you out.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:14.346
No, I got it.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.417
I know you got it, but come on now!

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.950
Oh, right, trying to impress the lady
by being a gentleman!

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.896
Maybe, but you're kind of messing up
my game right now.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.265
Okay. I love you.

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:29.428
I love you too.

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.304
Hey, baby.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.563
So that's Julie?

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.790
- Yeah.
- She is pretty.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:03.999
Let's get out of here.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:17.183
Aleya is a wonderful young lady
and a sassy little thing.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:19.446
That she is.

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:22.786
Thank you for being so amazing
with her today.

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.681
You done good, Mr. Dad.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:28.718
What?

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.255
What?

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.724
What is that look?

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.433
I think I'm falling for you.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.955
Listen, I, um,

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.426
just wanna say I'm sorry
for that whole thing back there.

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.128
What thing?

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.721
You mean me seeing Julie,

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:08.464
or Julie seeing me?

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.470
It just was unexpected.

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:15.400
Okay.

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.914
Why don't you go get some rest?

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.565
I'll see you at the show tomorrow.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.011
Is that okay?

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:33.588
Good night.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.091
Good night.

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.500
God.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.637
Argh.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.701
What do you want, Sam?

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.679
I guess that means you're still mad at me?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.875
Yes, I am.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.579
But you saved my name and number
in your phone, so...

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.622
Girl, please don't tell me you called
to rub in the fact that I like you.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.364
No, I didn't, um...

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.583
Yeah, well...

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.986
Well, damn!
You might wanna pep it up, mamacita!

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.325
We're on in 20.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.824
Yeah.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:15.531
You are so sweet!

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.332
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.339
Everything okay?

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:27.737
Yeah.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:34.411
Ah, Matthew, put your number in there.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.616
Oh, um...

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.182
Oh, I am... I am sorry,
are you two together?

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.658
No, we're not.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.252
For the show we're,

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.455
you know, debating philosophies.

01:08:57.765 --> 01:09:00.269
All right, we're back with Matthew Taylor,

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.441
<i>author of The Bounce Back,</i>

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:07.045
and Nina says, go out and get this book
because we love this book.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.212
Am I right, Love Nation?

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.957
We love this book.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:17.488
But Matthew,
my next guest has a bone to pick with you.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:22.332
Please welcome clinical psychologist,
Dr. Kristin Peralto!

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.350
Come on out Dr. Kristin!

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.604
That's right, Dr. Kristin.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.377
<i>Welcome to Love Nation!</i>

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.848
Thank you so much for having me!

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.283
Thank you for coming!

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:42.854
So you have a beef with Matthew.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.715
Yes, I do, Nina,

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.589
because Mr. Taylor

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:50.124
preys on weak-minded women.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.962
He tells them what they want to hear
in order to get them to expose themselves,

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:57.334
and well, he just doesn't want to
follow-through when push comes to shove.

01:09:57.393 --> 01:10:01.739
Hmm, are you talking about his book
or is this something personal?

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.075
I think for people like Ms. Peralto,

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.106
- a common...
- Excuse me, people like me?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.116
You mean, women who trust you,
who you make feel special?

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:12.083
And I am talking about the book,

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.586
I am talking about reading the book.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:19.092
They feel as though your words
are the most comforting thing imaginable

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:24.120
and then this whole you thing,
with your swagger and your self-confidence.

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.031
- Nina, let me ask you a question...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.633
And this is for all of the women
in the audience.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:35.334
How is it that a relationship guru
isn't in a relationship?

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.569
Mmm.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.169
Girl, you are going in for the kill,
but, Matthew, I got to say,

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.112
my brown sister has a point.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:43.806
We'll see, in my book The Bounce <i>Back,</i>

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:46.853
I actually ask people
to focus on the past...

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:49.183
Oh, I am sorry, is that in the

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.781
"I haven't really gotten over my ex-wife
who woke up and said

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:54.760
"she didn't love me anymore" chapter?
Because I didn't read that.

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:59.158
Whoa! This is getting
better than I thought.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.335
She is a piece of work, isn't she?

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:03.991
Are you still in love with your ex-wife?

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:10.307
Well...

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.013
I didn't see that one coming, Nina.

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.877
But the answer is,

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:20.616
when my ex-wife woke up one day
after ten years of marriage

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.687
and told me that
she didn't love me anymore,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.754
I decided that I needed
a new definition of love.

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:29.989
What is love?

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.493
Is it a feeling,

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:34.961
is it a commitment,

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.628
a happily ever after pill?

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:41.065
I would like to think it's a choice.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.600
See, Nina, we choose people
for who they are

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.545
and who they aren't

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.208
and we make that choice
every single day that we are together.

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.386
So yes, Ms. Peralto,

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:55.482
I do love my ex-wife.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.852
I don't think I will ever stop loving her,

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:03.623
but she is not the woman that I choose
to give my love to anymore.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.766
See, I really believe that we have to
stop thinking that love just happens.

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:12.166
That somehow, we are helpless
and just along for the ride.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:17.336
I honestly believe
that we make that choice.

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:19.446
Wow.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.674
<i>That's how we do on Love Nation.</i>

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:25.241
Well, I'd like to thank Matthew Taylor
and Dr. Kristin Peralto

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:26.980
for coming on Love Nation

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:30.114
and having a passionate discussion
about The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:34.023
And everyone in the studio
audience is going home

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.586
with a complimentary copy
of The Bounce <i>Back.</i>

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:45.003
That has been our show today,
and remember we are a nation of love.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.649
Matthew, I need to talk to you.
We got good news, brother.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.211
Good news!

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.315
Come on, man. What are we waiting for?

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.518
Can we focus here?

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:11.524
Can I get your mic?

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.668
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.236
<i>I know you slept
with her, just tell me, don't deny it.</i>

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.504
- The mic is still live.
<i>- I</i> can smell it.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:20.672
Touch that dial
and I will break your fingers.

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:21.936
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.373
- What's going on?
- You did it.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:25.902
I knew you did it.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.504
T, what's the good news?

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.048
First of all I just wanna say
that I should have had more

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:34.144
<i>faith in you because I thought it was over for
us after that whole Live Night situation.</i>

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:37.622
<i>Phew! I saw your wheels turning,
but I didn't know how you would go</i>

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.824
out and get her to do the show with us,
you know what I am saying?

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:43.625
But then you had the fire-breather in here,
following you here like a little puppy.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.495
Ah! That was masterful, bro.

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:49.362
<i>And just to seal the
deal, you sealed a deal.</i>

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:53.166
You threw her
right out of her game.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.003
She was out there looking ridiculous.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.474
<i>So what are you getting at?</i>

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:57.738
<i>Problem solved.</i>

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.276
<i>We just booked the Jason Kennedy Show.</i>

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.640
- What?
- Yeah, I told you, I am working for you, man.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.183
<i>What are we
supposed to do about her?</i>

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.785
<i>What do you mean,
what we are going to do?</i>

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.083
<i>I mean, come on, man!</i>

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.417
The monkey is off our back.

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.852
Oh, T, I don't know, man.

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:13.552
What exactly are you going to tell her?

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.959
I got to talk
to her, T, I got to.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.426
Are you ser... Matthew!

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.700
Excuse me.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.768
What the hell was that?

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.735
Uh, your microphone is still on.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:36.345
- Wait a minute, did she...
- She did.

01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:00.335
<i>I am gonna blow
his seminar up online.</i>

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:04.673
When I am finished with him,
he is going to wish he never met you.

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.843
Big Momma is gonna take care of you.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.534
- Maybe that's him.
- Don't do anything.

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.135
- Don't.
- I won't.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.198
Kristin!

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.233
Kristin!

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:43.116
Kristin! Open up! I know you're home!

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:46.484
I am not leaving here
until you talk to me, Kristin!

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.182
Hey, man. Has it occurred to you,
she might not be at home?

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:50.279
Kristin!

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.581
Kristin!

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.187
- Kristin!
- Stop it. Stop saying Kristin.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:59.052
Kristin, come on,
I know you are home, open up!

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.732
- It's my neighbor.
- Man.

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.634
Daryl. Hi.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.904
Um, why don't you just tell him
that I'm not coming home tonight.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.534
Okay.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.980
She said she's not coming home,
you are wasting your time.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.244
Where is she?

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.116
She doesn't wanna talk to you,
you need to go home.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:21.483
Look, I know she is here.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:24.119
Kristin! Kristin!

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.754
Please go home, Matthew!

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.687
Listen to me, I can explain.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.828
You are not explaining your way
out of this one, okay,

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.923
- you slimy, no good...
- Okay.

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:35.764
Self-help guru whatever you think you are.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.293
Kristin, please.

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.168
I know, I know, it's not what I think,

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:42.240
I am sure that there is a perfectly good
reason why you lied to me for a month

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.676
and then sold me down the river
as soon as something better came along.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.838
I didn't lie to you.

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.812
So all that talk about, uh,

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.748
wanting to bring balance to the tour,
that wasn't a lie?

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.184
I meant it when I said that, I meant it,

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.720
I really wanted you there with me.

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.382
Goodbye, Matthew!

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.584
I agree. Kick rocks. Bye-bye.

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:01.660
I am not letting you go,
I'm not losing you like this.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:04.596
You used me. What am I supposed to say,

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.827
the past doesn't exist and move on?

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:08.865
I am not like you, Matthew.

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.741
Love don't live
here anymore, buddy.

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.016
Hello.

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:36.821
Wait a minute, what?

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:40.566
Okay, hey. Slow down, Julie, slow down,
she is not with me.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.796
Where is George?

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.792
All right, I'll be right there,
I will pick you up.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.283
Okay, where would she be?

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.018
Over there.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.724
Hey, Julie, slow down, slow down.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.569
Wait, I am gonna go up, you go down,
we will circle back.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.266
Are you going to kill me?

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:52.961
I think your mom is
going to kill you twice over.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.201
Doesn't matter.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.474
What happened?

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:03.677
He didn't come.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:09.416
Maybe he just got held up.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.148
No.

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:15.092
He was here, he just didn't come over.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.891
It was all a joke to him.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.032
Look at you.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:29.268
You are beautiful,
you are smart, you are so sweet.

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:33.805
Aleya.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.043
Love

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:42.635
is the most beautiful thing
that we can experience in this world.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.925
And if you were lucky enough
to feel this for that boy,

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.892
nobody can ever take that away from you,

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.896
that's something special just for you.

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.499
And I promise you something,

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:58.236
one day you are gonna meet someone
who loves you back,

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.966
just as much as you love him.

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:03.607
And when that happens,

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:07.974
it's magical.

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.143
I know, Dad.

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:13.444
Oh, you do?

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:16.015
Uh-huh.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.556
But it still hurts,

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:22.020
and it totally sucks too.

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:27.497
So I think I'm just gonna
keep crying until it stops hurting.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.820
Thank you.

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:25.855
Hey. I know you are upset,
but you can't stay mad at me forever.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.852
I am not mad at you.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.085
Grateful.

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.453
Grateful?

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:38.902
I read it,

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.804
cover to cover,
and you know what, you're right.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:47.138
The only way to heal is to learn to accept
that the past doesn't exist,

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.547
and you got me to that point.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:55.150
I am ready to create my future.
I know what I want,

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.452
and it isn't this.

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.652
It doesn't matter
how hot we are for each other,

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:08.096
we are too different
and chemistry isn't enough.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:23.443
I am sorry, Matthew,
but, um, I have a busy schedule today,

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:25.917
if you can believe it.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.811
Oh, hey.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.410
Matthew Taylor.

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:59.145
Yeah, I know. I'm George.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:02.318
I know. It's nice to finally meet you.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.550
Aleya, she raves about you.

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.617
Not as much as she raves about her daddy.

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:12.756
Come on in.

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:18.400
Who is at the door?

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.995
Dad.

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:27.302
Hey, Julie.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.314
HEY. baby girl.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:31.851
Oh, what a nice surprise.

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:36.613
Your place, uh, it looks great.

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.416
It's all George's.

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:42.621
Um, he's got the touch.

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.253
Oh, don't embarrass me.

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:02.237
Hmm.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.781
He's a meat lover.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:19.422
He is nice, and you two are nice together.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.225
Thank you.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.161
George really likes you.

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:28.974
I am just happy
you and I can finally be friends.

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.599
Yeah.

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.339
Julie,

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:40.315
you never loved me as much as I loved you,
did you?

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.717
I really wanted to.

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:53.291
I am sorry.

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.065
Don't be, don't be.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:03.799
I think...
I think I found somebody who does.

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.113
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.786
So I recognize this great hookup
you giving me.

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:23.886
Hmm.

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:25.256
So what's the angle?

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:28.432
Angle? I am just helping out some
friend in the talent department.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:31.926
Oh, so your being here today
has nothing to do with me.

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.438
Oh, pure coincidence.

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.639
Do you think I am gonna believe that?

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.241
I don't know what you
are willing to believe.

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:39.973
You like me, don't you?

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.843
- Admit it!
- Everybody settle down

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:47.819
and we are on in five, four, three, two...

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:52.589
Welcome back. My next guest is
author and relationship expert

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.627
Matthew Taylor.
His new book The Bounce <i>Back</i>

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:59.631
is for anyone struggling to get back on
their feet after the end of a relationship.

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.832
- Nice to see you, man.
- Well thanks for having me, Jason.

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:04.530
I am curious though,
what do you hope people walk away with

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:06.401
after reading The Bounce <i>Back?</i>

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:10.136
What if I told you that
you don't have to endure, overcome...

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.810
See that's why the book
is winning right there.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.747
He is honest,
he knows how to connect with people.

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:19.580
I would say I wanna know how your book
can deliver all those promises.

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.054
Well, um...

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.925
<i>But then</i> I <i>read The Bounce Back,</i>

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:35.456
and I got to say, I get it, especially
when you talk about the past.

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:38.432
Yeah, the past.

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.776
<i>You know a lot of relationship...</i>

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.973
Don't look at me, he is your guy.

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:51.414
Gurus talk about the past
and making peace with it,

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:56.478
but you don't say that at all,
you say the past doesn't exist.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:58.747
But doesn't it, Jason?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.927
I mean, it's a great idea in principle.

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.990
Pretending like the past doesn't exist,

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:09.295
it's not the same thing as completing it.

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.467
I don't think I read
that in the book though.

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:14.002
That's because it's not in there, Jason.

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.174
I didn't know it when I wrote this book.

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.337
Oh. Oh, my God.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.206
No, no!

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:24.014
Even though you might think
that you are done with the past,

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:26.483
it doesn't necessarily mean that
the past has always done with you.

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.077
What are you trying to say exactly?

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.383
I am full of crap.

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:35.125
What?

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:37.163
I am sorry, I am sorry,
I should not have laughed.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:40.062
- You...
- You guys... You guys are amazing.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.623
You think so?

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.097
<i>My book The Bounce Back,</i>

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.968
it didn't help me get over my ex-wife.

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.166
What did that?

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:51.733
I didn't get over, not really.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:57.246
I just created a philosophy
to keep me from getting hurt.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.149
This has gotta stop.

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:01.915
Shhh! Are you crazy?
This is live television.

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:03.319
You can't go on, okay.

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:04.413
Matthew!

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.118
The funny thing is,

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:10.263
I don't even think that I realized
that's what I was doing

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.956
until I met the girl of my dreams.

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:18.030
That's when I felt things that
I had never felt before.

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:22.204
This, uh, normally I go for a medium rare,

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:24.436
'cause that's where
most of the nutrients are,

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.843
because if you get it more well done
then it's...

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.608
You have a beautiful nose.

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.806
Mmm.

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.476
Just I had to say it.

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.314
I... I don't like my nose.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.016
No, it's beautiful and that was weird.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.622
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.789
Uh, yeah, you're welcome.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:42.893
<i>Who is this special person?</i>

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.089
<i>Kristin Peralto.</i>

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:45.187
Is that you?

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.329
Hey, go back a couple.

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.836
No, no, no, no, there's...
No, no, no, not needed.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:55.465
<i>She is the therapist who doesn't think
too highly of your book, right?</i>

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.368
<i>I was scared.</i>

01:28:58.766 --> 01:28:59.972
I know that now.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:06.649
But what I didn't know
was how to handle her love.

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.386
- What are you doing?
- Just wait.

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:11.583
Can he hear me? Matthew!

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.022
What I was going through.

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:17.056
I might still be with her right now.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.497
Well, it was nice meeting you.

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.467
No, no, no, no, don't leave,

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.936
I... We... We are not together.

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:28.769
That guy is on national television
pouring his heart out to you.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.104
Yeah, I understand but...

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:32.906
Hey, lady, you're on TV.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.547
Oh, my God! That's her.

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:37.172
<i>Jason, um...</i>

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.912
<i>By all means, do what you need to do
right there.</i>

01:29:45.246 --> 01:29:46.924
Please can somebody go...
Can we go to commercial?

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.092
- Can you tell them...
- Stop!

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:50.461
Talk to the people in the...
Talk to the people in the booth.

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.520
Kristin,

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.294
I'm sorry.

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.299
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.770
Hey. Turn that up.

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.981
<i>Nothing has happened
the way that I planned it.</i>

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.712
<i>I never saw you coming.</i>

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:17.655
Matthew, don't cry on TV, man! Suck it up.

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:20.224
<i>I Vow that I ha ve caught a glimpse
of you in my life,</i>

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.662
<i>I can't imagine it without you
in it anymore.</i>

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:31.060
<i>I didn't honor the love that you felt for
me because I had never experienced it.</i>

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.398
<i>I didn't know what it was</i>

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.110
<i>to be loved back.</i>

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.149
I think he's in love with you!

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:46.074
Check, please.

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:48.794
<i>I appreciate your honesty,
for you being candid. Thank you.</i>

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:54.415
<i>We are gonna be right back
with the surprising Matthew Taylor.</i>

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.585
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:18.940
Hello.

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.214
Matthew Taylor!

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.686
Wait a minute! What did you say?

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.084
- What are you doing?
- Where?

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.854
Okay. Thanks.

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:29.622
- What the hell is going on, man?
- T, I'm sorry.

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:33.291
If you don't go in there right now and fix
this, everything we worked for is over.

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.455
I love her.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:37.466
What? Her? Really?

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.538
- Her?
- I can't let her get away.

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.873
I know this means the world to you, I do.

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.604
But look at me. T, look at me.

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.308
I have been dead inside
for way too long, you know that.

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:51.443
He is not leaving, is he?

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:53.952
Shhh... Let's give it a minute.

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:56.086
- I don't wanna give it a minute.
- Give it a minute.

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.057
Guess we could kiss
being the number one bestseller goodbye.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.158
If you really want me to go back in there
and do this...

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.025
Yeah, man. Whatever, man.

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.086
You know what. It's a good gesture.

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:08.847
But at the end of the day
you gotta do what's right for you, man.

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:13.405
And what real friend is gonna
get in the way of that?

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:15.572
- It looks like he is leaving to me.
- Alex, you are losing it

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.274
- I am getting anxiety attacks.
- You're losing it.

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.742
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Give it a minute.

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:19.767
Gi...

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:23.716
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, this is not happening!

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.685
- T, you got this. You sure?
- Yeah, you're good.

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:28.176
Thank you.

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.254
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this is beyond unacceptable.

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:31.522
- Shhh.
- We are on in 30 seconds.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.423
- Lower your voice, lower your voice.
- I will call security.

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:34.858
You are not gonna call anybody!

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:36.593
- Excuse me! Let me do my job.
- Let me tell you something.

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:39.029
You better back up
before I put these two books in your ass.

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.437
Um, Gary, do we have
Jeff Goldblum available?

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:50.033
I am impressed.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:51.776
Thank you. Thank you.

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:53.470
With him.

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.442
Of course.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.876
Oh. That was good.

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.584
You wanna go get a drink?

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.182
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:12.195
So he lied to me,
he used me to get on this stupid talk show

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.960
just to promote his stupid book.

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:17.762
Sounds like he is just scared
to fall in love again.

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.467
He did sound sincere about that.

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:22.670
You two should really talk this out.

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.903
Listen, I am done with him.

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.377
I am completely through
with Matthew Taylor.

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.381
- Get in the car!
- Oh.

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:39.718
Kristin, wait!

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.418
Why we are racing to the car?

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:44.486
- Just take me home, Glen.
- All right.

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:45.832
Wait! Kristin! Kristin!

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:48.992
Just, please, please let me talk to you
for a second. Hear me out, please!

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.194
Is that him?

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:51.435
- Drive Glen, please!
- Okay.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:52.529
No, no!

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.971
No, don't move the car.
Stop the car, please!

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:57.737
- How did you know I was here?
- Sarah told me.

01:33:57.798 --> 01:34:00.404
- Is that your friend?
- Yes, drive! Please go!

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.074
- I don't know if I feel comfortable.
- Shut up, Glen! Please!

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:06.846
I messed up, Kristin, okay?
I didn't know what to do.

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.652
I really think you two
should talk this out.

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:10.519
- Please just go, Glen!
- All right.

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.615
I am getting anxiety.

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:15.387
Kristin, please!

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.458
Shut up Glen and just go. Just go!

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.520
Okay.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.624
Not backwards, Glen, forward, forward!

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:23.691
If I go forward, I'm gonna hit him!

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:25.760
No, he is gonna move out of the way.
Just go, Glen!

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.328
Shut up, Glen and just go!

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:28.874
I just need you talk to me!

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.431
- Go, Glen! Please!
- Okay!

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.705
- Shut up! Just go forward!
- Fine!

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.474
- Forward! Go!
- I'm gonna hit him!

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:35.775
- Forward!
- All right!

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.440
Matthew, get out of the way!

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.711
I am not moving.

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.983
You want me to go forward? Forward!

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:44.653
- Matthew, get out of the way!
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:45.780
Get out of the way!

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.017
Ahhh!

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.057
Oh, my God!

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:52.478
- Are you dead?
- Matthew!

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.127
Matthew.

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:59.504
You're crazy.

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:03.731
- What are you doing?
- Kristin.

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:07.302
Kristin, Kristin, just
listen to me, please.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.243
You were right,

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:14.549
you can't create a future without
completing the past, you were right.

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:19.755
Pretending like Julie and I never happened,
it doesn't work, okay?

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.496
You're the only person in my life
who has ever loved me back

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:25.826
as much as I love them.

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.865
I know you think I was trying to play you.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.640
And I was. I am so sorry for that.

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:38.777
I will never hurt you again.

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:46.143
You're too important to me.

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.115
I need you.

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:55.658
Kristin, I love you.

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.356
You love me?

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:00.891
Yes.

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.690
Really?

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.668
Yes. Yes.

01:36:06.727 --> 01:36:08.104
Really, really?

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:12.638
I do.

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:47.375
<i>Welcome</i> back <i>to
The George Addison</i> show!

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:50.608

Well, thank you for having us, George!

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:12.161
There is an interesting story
on what you guys did on your honeymoon.

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:13.966
Let's just say we were, uh...

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.433
We were very productive.

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:19.141
We were. We were productive writing.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.173
- I love their chemistry.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.738
- They feed off each other perfectly, right?
- Uh-huh.

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:26.375
This is good. This is good.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:28.885
It's a very impressive booking
right out of the gate.

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.188
Honestly, it was all Matthew.

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.551
Thank you for the invite.

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:38.993
You know, I've never been
part of someone's posse, so...

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.196
Because you're usually
the behind the scenes,

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:43.175
calling the shots type of girl, huh?

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:51.035
Hey, he's... Actually, we have another
relationship seminar in Diego,

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.476
would you be interested in coming down
for the weekend?

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:55.303
It would be cool.

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.840
You want me to spend
the weekend with you?

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:01.546
At the relationship seminar,
it's nice weather, people...

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.849
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.947
Beaches, military.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.587
Sure.

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.958
Military?

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.002
We started talking about
our first kiss, right?

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:21.665
Yes, and how undeniable it was,

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:24.369
our connection,
and our attraction for one another.

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:26.202
We were connecting a lot.

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:30.344
<i>And brainstorming, George, we were...</i>

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.941
<i>She was brainstorming.
I was trying to connect.</i>

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:36.352
<i>This is true, mostly me,
I was brainstorming.</i>

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.121
Come here!

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:57.634
Come here.

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.471
I am looking for something.

01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:01.011
What do you mean
you're looking for something?

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:02.241
Just, hold on.

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.077
Oh, okay, well, hold on, wait a minute.

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:08.493
Kristin, you're about to step up
to the mic, what are you doing, huh?

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:09.980
I can't find it.

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:11.554
Babe, it's right
there in the middle.

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:12.989
No, I'm not talking about that.

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:14.788
It's going to sneak up on you.
Watch out now!

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:15.926
Hold on, I'm trying to find something.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.260
- What do you mean find something?
- Where'd it go?

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:20.263
- Babe?
- Huh?

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:23.182
I think we need
to start a new book.

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:24.795
Start a new book?

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:29.863
What?

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:37.771
No.

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:40.411
Really?

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:43.214
We're having a baby.

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:44.917
We're having a baby.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.583
- We're having a baby?
- Yes.

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.856
- Kristin, we're having a baby?
- Yes.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:58.930
I love you. We're having a baby.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.966
We're having a baby.

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.210
- We're having a baby.
- Yes!
