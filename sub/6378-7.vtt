WEBVTT

00:14.723 --> 00:17.260
Pig!

00:33.534 --> 00:37.618
Just give in. It feels so good.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.621
Tara, what has she done to you?

01:08.360 --> 01:10.066
What the...?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.903
Stop, Sam.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.298
Here, Sam. You're gonna be the one.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.044
Hey! Nobody move.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.126
I said don't fucking move.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.050
Terry?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.306
What the hell are you doing?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.969
Put on some goddamn pants.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.101
What the hell?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.362
Godric! Godric, can you hear me?

04:09.124 --> 04:12.036
Isabel and Eric sent us. Godric!

04:12.210 --> 04:15.919
I know he's down here. I heard the awful
things they're planning to do to him.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.798
Remember how I said I was claustrophobic?
I wasn't making that part up.

04:19.968 --> 04:24.507
It's bad. Okay?
I can't take elevators, walk-in closets.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.263
You know hotels,
how they tuck the sheets in all tight?

04:27.434 --> 04:30.141
Just thinking about that
makes me wanna scream.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.928
"Jesus Christ: Vampire Exterminator"?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.846
"Silver and Stakes"?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.686
-"Send 'Em Back to Hell"?
-SooMe.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.816
So sick, teaching kids to hate like this.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.649
I don't have time for games.
I need to get out of here.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.438
Take a deep breath.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.198
Look at me.

04:45.368 --> 04:49.407
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure this out, all right?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.164
Okay. Okay.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.246
Okay. I'm okay.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.207
So the Newlins knew who we were
the minute we walked in.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.838
Same way they knew
to come after me at the airport.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.547
-Someone at that nest's a traitor.
-A vampire's siding with the Fellowship...

05:04.721 --> 05:09.090
-...to get Godric out of the way?
-Stan? Because he wants to be sheriff?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.883
I've heard of ambitious,
but that's just plain crazy.

05:12.062 --> 05:16.101
Well, you've met him. I mean, he would rip
our throats out for looking at him sideways.

05:16.274 --> 05:21.109
If it's true, Bill and Eric could do
a lot worse to him when they find out.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.024
Bill had to have sensed my fear.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.569
He's gonna come storming through
this church any second.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.659
And you don't seem happy
about that because...?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.284
These fanatics are about to barbecue
a 2000-year-old vampire...

05:37.462 --> 05:39.953
...in front of the entire congregation.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.259
Who knows what else they're capable of?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.759
-Get out of my way.
-But we have so much catching up to do.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.591
Move now!

05:49.224 --> 05:51.761
I will not ask again.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.218
You smell like her.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.262
Sweet...

05:58.233 --> 06:00.189
...and cheap.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.538
Some might say it's a weakness,
but I've always found it oddly cute.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.246
We can play this game all night,
but we both know I am stronger and faster.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.131
So, really, what's the point?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.718
What are you doing here?

06:30.307 --> 06:32.093
I've missed you.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.054
It's been so long.

06:48.325 --> 06:52.819
-You're back early.
-I loathe musicals.

06:52.996 --> 06:57.160
They're always so
desperately cheerful, aren't they?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.873
I brought you a present.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.832
Frances, this is Alfred.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.467
-Alfred, Frances.
-Hello.

07:09.638 --> 07:14.678
Frances is in the chorus.
She has real talent.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.682
Show him.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.270
-Right here?
-That will not be necessary.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.665
Don't mind him.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.328
He's in one of his moods.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.246
Again.

07:46.883 --> 07:52.674
But I'm sure we can find a way
to cheer him up.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.885
I meant what I said.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.800
No more.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.517
You can't starve yourself, darling.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.354
Just taste her.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.360
She smells like...

08:16.538 --> 08:18.870
...apricots.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.366
Remember those?

08:40.937 --> 08:43.098
Leave now.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.232
You are such a wet blanket.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.362
I don't know why
I keep bothering with you.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.615
Why do you?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.446
I can't stand the sight of you.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.824
So dramatic.

09:04.544 --> 09:09.163
Perhaps we should head back South.
This town's a cultural desert.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.127
-lt's no wonder we are so depressed.
-l'm not depressed.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.963
I'm seeing clearly
for the first time in years.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.176
I won't do this any longer. It's over.

09:22.353 --> 09:28.064
No more innocent lives and bloody beds
and cruelty for sport.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.818
You are a vampire. They are food.
That's your nature.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.821
No. It is your nature.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.779
You have lost your humanity,
and you have stolen mine...

09:38.953 --> 09:40.614
...made me into a monster.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.162
| forgot myself...

09:44.375 --> 09:48.414
...and I will have to live with the things
that we've done for an eternity.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.506
I sometimes forget how young you are.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.507
This conscience of yours,
you will outgrow it.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.182
Trust me.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.847
We will get through this together.

10:06.356 --> 10:10.395
I will never again be
what you want me to be.

10:22.497 --> 10:28.458
lf Sookie is hurt in any way because of you,
I will not stop until I drive a stake...

10:28.628 --> 10:32.212
...through whatever semblance of a heart
you have left.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.710
It's true.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.633
You're in love...

10:38.346 --> 10:40.382
...with a human.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.633
That's so tragic it's funny.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.060
You have got to be joking me.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.237
This is the Fellowship of the Sun?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.023
That's their army?

11:00.201 --> 11:03.284
Scared little boys
with Bibles and crossbows?

11:03.454 --> 11:07.322
Don't underestimate them.
Support for their movement is growing.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.833
Their leadership camps are overflowing
with self-righteous extremists...

11:11.004 --> 11:14.041
...all willing and ready to die
for their cause.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.706
That can be arranged quite easily.

11:16.885 --> 11:20.252
Not until we know for sure
the Fellowship has Godric.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.342
What about your boy, Hugo...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.427
...and Sookie?

11:25.602 --> 11:28.469
-They've been in there too long.
-There's no sign of alarm.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.104
And if Hugo were in serious danger,
I would know it.

11:32.275 --> 11:36.268
I felt something earlier, but it passed.
He's okay now.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.645
Tell me...

11:39.490 --> 11:43.699
...what is it that you find so fulfilling
about human companionship?

11:45.872 --> 11:49.285
They feel much more strongly
than we do.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.700
Everything is urgent.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.834
Exciting.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.792
Maybe because their lives
are so temporary.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.799
Yes, they certainly don't keep well.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.263
Don't you find the prospect of him
growing old, sickly, crippled...

12:05.433 --> 12:09.642
...somewhat repulsive?

12:09.812 --> 12:13.475
No. | find it curious.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.766
Like a science project.

12:16.194 --> 12:20.813
How does Bill Compton feel
about your interest in Sookie?

12:22.325 --> 12:24.862
I'm not interested in Sookie.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.195
And even less in how Bill Compton feels.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.991
My only interest is finding Godric.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.410
Of course.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.749
Don't look at me like that.

12:38.549 --> 12:42.758
Do you really believe these fools
could overpower a vampire such as Godric...

12:42.929 --> 12:44.510
...and hold him for weeks?

12:44.806 --> 12:46.922
Stan is sure of it.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.840
But I have known Godric a long time.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.636
It's hard to imagine
anything could overpower him.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.609
Not anything human.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.366
It just don't make sense.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.788
Hey, ain't that a song?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.880
Hey.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.800
Don't cry, now.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.005
It's my fault.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.091
lf anyone's going to hell...

13:33.229 --> 13:35.220
...it's gonna be me.

13:35.857 --> 13:39.475
I wanted this
every bit as much as you did.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.770
And the strange thing
is I don't even feel guilty about it.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.866
So you're crying because...?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.161
Because I'm so happy.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.290
Oh, Jason.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.247
I thought I loved Steve.

13:59.422 --> 14:03.256
But I never even knew what love was
until you just showed me.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.929
-That's intense, huh?
-I know.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.176
Right now, here with you...

14:16.439 --> 14:19.556
...| feel closer to God than I ever have.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.019
Come on, we have to go.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.607
Yeah.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.572
-Yeah, I gotta get ready for training.
-No, forget training.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.452
We have to go tell Steve.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.783
What?

14:35.291 --> 14:39.284
Vow of honesty, Jason. Just because
I broke my vows to my husband...

14:39.462 --> 14:42.750
...doesn't mean I'm ready
to throw all my beliefs out the window.

14:42.924 --> 14:46.587
Hold on a sec.
We just can't walk in there and tell him.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.217
No, we have to.

14:48.679 --> 14:53.764
Somehow, someday, God will forgive us.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.597
It's the only way
we can have a future together.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.355
Let's just think about this for a second.
A, Steve has guns.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.391
Then there's the lockdown
tomorrow night.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.902
And secondly,
we're gonna be locked in this church...

15:07.073 --> 15:08.813
...with Steve and his guns all night.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.777
Oh, my Lord, the lock-in.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.238
-The morning ceremony. You're right.
-Right.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.654
We have to put God's interests
before our own.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.073
That's right. God comes first.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.333
But I promise you...

15:20.503 --> 15:25.998
...when I am standing up there
next to Steve...

15:26.843 --> 15:28.834
...all I'm gonna be thinking about is you.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.467
Yep. Yeah, me too.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.256
And the minute it's over,
we'll tell him, right?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.518
-Absolutely. I can't wait.
-Me either.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.188
-Okay?
-Okay.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.365
There's something I have to tell you.

16:02.003 --> 16:06.167
I haven't--
I ain't never told nobody before.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.757
Not even my best friend.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.044
Hell, especially not my best friend.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.187
I ain't never done it.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.182
With a girl, I mean.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.769
What have you done it with?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.617
Just myself.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.201
Oh, so you're a virgin?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.003
Well....

16:48.174 --> 16:50.665
Well, big whoop. So am |.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.170
You are?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.882
What, just because I'm a vampire,
you think I'm a slut?

16:55.223 --> 16:57.179
Of course not.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.761
I don't think you could ever be a slut.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.095
I don't think anybody is, really.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.729
People, theyjust want
somebody to be with.

17:09.612 --> 17:13.275
Well, I totally would've been a slut
if I could've gotten away with it.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.781
Me and my friend Laurie...

17:15.952 --> 17:19.444
...we had this bet since eighth grade
over who'd lose it first.

17:19.622 --> 17:24.537
I mean, she was, like, pregnant
before I even got my first kiss.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.202
I mean, my dad was such a dickhead.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.547
So, what's your excuse?

17:32.593 --> 17:35.801
l was gonna wait, you know...

17:36.472 --> 17:38.804
...till I met the right one.

17:40.685 --> 17:44.644
But the right one just never showed up.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.310
And by then, I'd waited for so long...

17:48.484 --> 17:52.068
...I figured I can'tjust give it away
to anybody.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.315
So now I'm 28...

18:00.371 --> 18:06.162
...and most girls probably think I'm, like,
some kind of bisexual gay or something.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.997
Not that I got
any kind of problem with them.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.040
But I'm not.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.506
Well, I'm not most girls.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.839
I'm not even a girl, technically.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.560
But if you're okay with that...

18:27.898 --> 18:30.025
...l'd be your first.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.356
You would?

18:40.870 --> 18:45.455
-What, now?
-No, silly. No, not tonight.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.038
It's gonna be dawn soon.
| get sick if I don't rest during the day.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.544
It's no problem. That's great.

18:51.714 --> 18:55.832
But we can cuddle if you like.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.047
Just don't freak out if I look a little...

18:59.221 --> 19:00.722
.udead.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.559
Maybe the little rats have run off,
joined the Fellowship themselves.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.190
-Careful. Hugo is mine.
-Oh, please.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.694
If you cared about him so much,
we'd have been in that church hours ago.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.231
With no plan, no exit strategy.
That's why you'll never be sheriff, Stan.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.991
-You don't think.
-And you're too chickenshit to act.

19:23.621 --> 19:27.113
Which is why we've been getting
Godric's coffee for the last 40 years.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.031
And you...

19:29.210 --> 19:31.451
...Fellowship has your maker
and your telepath...

19:31.629 --> 19:34.712
...and still you do nothing.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.332
Are you questioning my loyalty, Stan?

19:39.428 --> 19:42.215
Just trying to return Godric
to his rightful position.

19:42.390 --> 19:46.929
Oh, really? Because I think
maybe you have another agenda.

19:47.103 --> 19:51.392
Maybe you think starting a war with the
Fellowship will distract us from the truth...

19:51.565 --> 19:54.932
...that you're so starved for power,
you murdered Godric for his title.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.268
That is a lie.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.152
How dare you accuse me?

19:59.323 --> 20:02.941
Eric, we don't know this.
There's no proof.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.657
Not yet. But I will find it.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.284
And when I do...

20:11.001 --> 20:12.957
...there will be no mercy.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.587
In the meantime...

20:16.757 --> 20:20.215
...you two can stand here
and quibble over his position...

20:20.970 --> 20:25.179
...or run into that church and kill them all.
| no longer care.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.801
lf Godric is gone...

20:31.272 --> 20:34.014
...nothing will bring back
what I have lost.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.325
Eggs, wake up.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.504
Hey, gorgeous.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.792
What are we doing on the couch?
How did we get here?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.840
l have no idea.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.224
Last thing I remember...

21:10.394 --> 21:14.763
...was following those Reese's Pieces
clothes into the woods.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.858
I don't even remember coming back here.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.860
Wow, me neither.

21:22.031 --> 21:25.273
I guess thatjoint
must've knocked us out cold.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.361
That's never happened to me before.
At least not from smoking one joint.

21:30.539 --> 21:35.659
It's happened to me a couple times.
Maryann's weed is some serious shit.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.710
Yesterday, that weird place
you took me to with the blood...

21:41.884 --> 21:43.795
-...you couldn't--
-I got no idea what that is.

21:43.969 --> 21:48.053
But I'm pretty sure it's got nothing to do
with us getting high and passing out, okay?

21:48.224 --> 21:52.308
Well, maybe we've been smoking too much.
Maybe we need to sober up.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.560
Hey, that's okay.
I'm high enough just being with you.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.728
Oh, listen.

22:04.573 --> 22:08.191
Just because you got a little too stoned,
that don't make you your mama.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.325
You're right.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.742
Sometimes it's like you're Sookie.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.921
Like you can read my mind or something.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.919
| just get you, that's all.

22:59.128 --> 23:03.041
Morning. Refreshments?
How'd y'all sleep?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.671
They're coming for us, you know?

23:04.842 --> 23:07.504
That's what I thought.
I figured a pretty girl like you...

23:07.678 --> 23:09.794
...would have a vamp running off
to her rescue.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.510
-We were hoping for it, weren't we, Gabe?
-Yes, sir. Bring it on.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.471
We're ready for them.
We've been ready for a long time.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.978
You're gonna get yourself killed.
That's not a threat, it's a fact.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.983
They've got you all twisted up,
haven't they? With their glamouring...

23:25.154 --> 23:28.988
...and their empty promises
and their evil blood.

23:29.158 --> 23:32.446
You're the ones who are twisted.
You call yourself Christians?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.281
Jesus would be ashamed of you.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.833
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree on that one.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.915
Now...

23:44.506 --> 23:47.339
...things got a little out of hand
last night...

23:49.178 --> 23:51.260
...and I apologize for that.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.638
I'm not the monster that the vampire-loving
media makes me out to be.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.345
-Yeah, right.
-All I want from you is a couple answers.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.647
Then I'll be happy to feed you breakfast
and send you on your way.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.429
-What do you wanna know?
-Shut up.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.315
We need to get out of here.
Tell them what they wanna know.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.818
Her name is Sookie Stackhouse,
and I'm Hugo Ayers.

24:07.988 --> 24:12.197
We were sent here by the vampires
of Area 9 to find their sheriff.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.401
Sookie Stackhouse.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.119
From Bon Temps?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.791
How do you know where I'm from?

24:21.585 --> 24:24.292
You're Jason Stackhouse's...

24:25.047 --> 24:28.039
...sister. Am I right?

24:28.217 --> 24:30.208
You know Jason?

24:30.386 --> 24:33.048
He's got nothing to do with this.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.058
Come on, Gabe.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.759
How do you know my brother?

24:45.401 --> 24:46.481
-Nice work.
-Hey.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.394
We sat here all night
waiting for your boyfriend to show up.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.155
You can play damsel in distress
all you want, but I'm getting us out of here.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.362
Hugo, do me a favor, please.
Just shut the fuck up.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.415
Barry. Barry, can you hear me?
You've gotta help me.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.042
[need you to go to the hotel
and find Bil] Compton.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.205
Tell him I'm at the Fellowship of the Sun
church in the basement.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.090
The sheriff is here somewhere,
and I'm in big trouble.

25:12.261 --> 25:16.470
Please don 't ignore me.
This is a life-or—death situation. Please.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.092
We need to rest.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.395
So the minute I shut my eyes...

25:25.566 --> 25:29.104
...you can run into the sunlight
and destroy yourself to save her?

25:29.278 --> 25:32.190
Care about you too much to allow that.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.239
I may love her, but I am not suicidal.

25:39.413 --> 25:43.281
I know better than anyone
what you are capable of.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.375
Lorena, this is foolish.

25:55.637 --> 25:59.630
We are getting weaker.
The bleeds have begun.

26:01.685 --> 26:06.600
You may be able
to keep me here awake for a day...

26:06.774 --> 26:08.685
...maybe two...

26:09.568 --> 26:11.149
...but not forever.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.318
You're right.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.151
Forever is a long time.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.657
Then again...

26:18.827 --> 26:20.408
...l'm very patient.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.795
And who were you gonna call?

26:36.970 --> 26:40.258
If you will not let me go to her...

26:41.016 --> 26:44.008
...at least let me find someone who will.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.558
I am begging you.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.682
Let me call and wake up Eric Northman.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.523
He is the reason that Sookie's in danger.

26:56.156 --> 26:59.364
He is also the reason I'm here.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.705
He wants the girl, William.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.120
Just let him have her.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.469
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.382
-Hey, Stackhouse.
-How's it going? Looking good.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.552
Hey. Where you off to, Jason?

27:29.565 --> 27:30.600
Just taking a walk.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.641
-With your suitcase?
-Yeah.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.112
Get in the car, Stackhouse.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.071
-Get in the fucking car.
-Okay, okay.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.736
Now.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.913
Go.

27:55.465 --> 27:59.424
With a bull mask and these giant claws.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.381
Claws?

28:01.555 --> 28:05.343
And the whole town had these
big black saucer eyes like zombies.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.869
Good morning.

28:37.466 --> 28:41.800
-Maryann, you okay?
-Oh, I am fantastic.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.258
I slept outside last night
and l communed with my animal nature.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.630
No shit.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.469
This little fella hopped by,
and I thought, "Yummy. Rabbit stew."

28:52.856 --> 28:54.687
Poor bunny.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.726
Feeling sorry for things is just an excuse
not to celebrate your own happiness.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.481
Speaking of...

29:04.243 --> 29:08.577
...you two look positively glowy.
What did you do last night?

29:09.831 --> 29:13.369
We just crashed out, I guess.

29:14.294 --> 29:17.001
Did you throw a party here
while we were gone?

29:17.172 --> 29:21.882
Because when we got home,
the place looked like a frat house.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.839
I had a few people over for drinks.
That a problem?

29:25.013 --> 29:27.925
It's Sookie's house,
and she can come home anytime.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.807
And when she does,
I'm sure she'll be grateful...

29:30.978 --> 29:34.516
...that you fixed that nasty old water heater
and you took care of the place.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.480
You're such a good friend.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.942
Karl?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.320
Karl?

29:44.116 --> 29:48.576
-She is so fucking weird.
-I know. Isn't it great?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.663
You know what burns me the most,
is that I brought you into my home.

29:56.837 --> 30:00.125
-I treated you like family.
-I know, and I'm so sorry.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.881
It's just that I'm weak.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.087
Yes, you are.

30:05.262 --> 30:10.302
I gave you a chance at salvation,
a chance to live in his holy light...

30:10.475 --> 30:11.851
...and you chose them?

30:12.019 --> 30:14.055
I know it was wrong. |--

30:14.938 --> 30:17.975
-Wait. Who are "them"?
-Oh, please, cut the act.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.893
I know who you are
and who you're working for.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.150
The road crew?

30:25.866 --> 30:27.777
That's funny.

30:27.951 --> 30:31.068
Oh, boy. I didn't think that you were
the sharpest tool in the shed.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.578
Good at taking orders, but not too bright.

30:33.749 --> 30:38.083
But, boy, was I wrong.
You are snakier than a snake in the grass.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.670
Steve, buddy--

30:44.968 --> 30:48.005
You're making a mistake, okay?

30:48.180 --> 30:52.264
You're confusing me
with somebody else or something.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.974
Say a prayer.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.937
You are going to hell.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.270
And you are going there today.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.028
-Steve.
-Take care of him.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.564
Yes, sir.

31:08.742 --> 31:11.028
Start walking, vampire lover. Come on.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.675
Hello, Sam.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.879
Been looking for you.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.927
Figured you would be.

31:36.937 --> 31:37.972
Now, what's that for?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.307
Come any closer...

31:40.482 --> 31:42.393
...you'll find out.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.476
You think I'm scared of dying?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.229
I know you're scared of Maryann.

31:50.117 --> 31:54.577
Those scars on your back,
that how she got you to be her whore?

31:54.955 --> 31:56.946
It ain't whoring if you do it for love.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.866
Why don't you stop pretending
you ever gave a shit about me?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.625
Honey, I ain't talking about you.

32:03.004 --> 32:06.792
-We had fun, but--
-We had fun?

32:06.967 --> 32:09.879
I fucking trusted you.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.090
I shared parts of myself
I never shared with anyone.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.846
How can you do this to your own kind?

32:16.017 --> 32:20.135
Sam, I used to be scared and stupid...

32:20.313 --> 32:23.396
...full of shame, just like you.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.353
She could've killed me.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.484
l deserved it.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.271
But she saw something in me...

32:32.284 --> 32:33.820
...and she saved me.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.736
Gave me a whole new life.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.871
No fear, no limits, just love.

32:41.209 --> 32:45.327
Killing people, cutting out their hearts,
that ain't love.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.791
You know what you are
next to Maryann?

32:47.966 --> 32:51.129
An ant. No, a flea.

32:51.553 --> 32:55.637
-lt's kind of perfect.
-If I'm so fucking insignificant...

32:55.807 --> 32:59.095
...why is she going through
all this trouble trying to get me?

32:59.269 --> 33:03.057
Because you got away from her once.
She can't control you.

33:04.107 --> 33:09.818
See those funny big black eyes folks are
running around with, acting all crazy?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.650
That's Maryann's energy inside of them.

33:12.824 --> 33:18.239
She is driving them
like tiny little remote-control airplanes.

33:18.580 --> 33:22.323
But that don't work on us
because we're shifters?

33:22.876 --> 33:26.243
All supernaturals,
we got a natural resistance.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.547
She can force our shifts
and other stuff with other supes...

33:30.717 --> 33:33.208
...but she can't get inside us.

33:33.386 --> 33:38.471
We gotta go to her on our own free will.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.099
And she just loves a challenge.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.521
I'm not a challenge.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.179
I'm a person.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.941
Well, not exactly.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.569
l'm sweating like a pig. God.

33:56.743 --> 34:00.110
You wanna get wet with me
one last time, Sammy?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.956
What is she?

34:07.295 --> 34:10.128
What the fuck is she?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.714
She's God, dumb-dumb.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.673
Hey.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.384
Hey, I need to use the bathroom.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.517
Hey! Come on, let me out of here!

34:23.687 --> 34:25.177
Here.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.471
-|'|| turn my back.
-I don't need that.

34:27.649 --> 34:31.141
-I need to get the hell out of here.
-Hugo, this is not helping.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.605
Just sit down.

34:33.780 --> 34:34.986
Just-- Look, try to relax.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.488
Praise his light. Open your heart.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.696
-|'|| infiltrate the Fellowship of the Sun.
-Absolutely not.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.280
Let her speak.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.071
They're sending in a spy tomorrow.
I'll be with her.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.497
You?

34:50.213 --> 34:51.953
You're the traitor.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.332
Maryann is not God.

34:55.510 --> 34:59.674
Well, she's as close to God
as we'll ever get.

34:59.848 --> 35:06.845
People call her all kinds of things:
Kali, Lilith, Isis, Gaia.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.185
But what she really is, is a maenad.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.645
What the fuck is that?

35:13.820 --> 35:17.859
According to the Greeks,
maenads were handmaidens of Dionysus.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.695
But they're really a lot more than that.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.609
Dionysus, the god of wine?

35:23.705 --> 35:26.617
You did own a bar. It makes sense
that you would know that one.

35:26.791 --> 35:31.455
But guess what else they called him.
The horned god. Sound familiar?

35:32.922 --> 35:36.210
-Satan?
-Dionysus, Satan.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.545
It's reallyjust a kind of energy.

35:38.720 --> 35:44.386
Wild energy,
like lust, anger, excess, violence.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.891
Basically, all the fun stuff.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.223
Maryann brings it out in people.

35:49.397 --> 35:53.310
She channels it, controls it.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.191
She's immortal, Sam.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.024
She never wasn't here.

35:58.573 --> 36:02.157
So there ain't no point in fighting her,
you see? You'll never win.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.703
Well, I'm not gonna just let her kill me.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.745
Being a part of something divine
is worth dying a thousand times.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.083
You'll see.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.710
If I give myself up...

36:22.847 --> 36:24.758
...will she go away,
leave everyone alone?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.925
I wouldn't bet on that.
She's having too much fun.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.015
And this town's full of crazies
ripe for the picking.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.228
She's like a pyro
in a room full of matches.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.771
Just go to her, Sam.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.402
Play nice.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.437
She might even let you live.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.198
Stay the fuck away from me.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.619
I used to be just like you.

36:53.169 --> 36:58.630
Thought I was a real emancipated thinker.
Especially when Isabel took me to bed.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.961
And the sex was...

37:01.678 --> 37:02.884
...amazing.

37:03.054 --> 37:07.548
The best I ever-- Well, you know.
It's addictive, isn't it?

37:08.435 --> 37:13.225
-To be desired by something that powerful.
-l'm no addict.

37:13.815 --> 37:17.478
No. I guess you wouldn't know
how your life changes to suit them.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.812
You start missing work...

37:18.987 --> 37:22.605
...can't get up in the morning,
can't stand to leave them after dark.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.615
Before you know it,
you're somebody you don't even recognize.

37:25.785 --> 37:29.573
So you went to the Fellowship
because you can't control yourself?

37:30.290 --> 37:32.952
I begged her to turn me.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.458
It was the only way
we could be together as equals.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.789
But, see,
they don't want us to be equals.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.209
No, she's just been using me.

37:44.387 --> 37:48.346
-The same way that Bill's been using you.
-You don't know Bill.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.303
I know he and his friends
are having you do their dirty work.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.935
A telepath's gotta be a real trophy
for a vampire.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.188
-Shut up.
-All they care about is their own kind.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.269
Okay? That's why I joined the Fellowship.

37:59.444 --> 38:03.904
So if the Newlins care so much about you,
how come you're still in here?

38:04.449 --> 38:08.988
Face it, Hugo, you're nothing
but a fangbanging traitor to them.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.031
Gabe?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.873
Gabe, she knows everything.
You can let me out now.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.034
Hey. Anybody.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.046
Come on, let me out!

38:19.214 --> 38:24.629
Yep, you're so all-fired important
to them, aren't you?

38:26.679 --> 38:31.469
Welcome. So glad you're here.
Praise his light. Cute pajamas.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.760
Simon. Julia.
This is your first lock-in, right?

38:34.938 --> 38:37.725
-We're so excited.
-l'm excited too. Amen.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.732
-Hey, darling. Looking good.
-You too.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.860
Well, I told you that suit was a winner.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.738
I need to talk to you in private.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.319
Did you bring your Bible?

38:49.494 --> 38:53.328
-lt's about Jason Stackhouse.
-Of course.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.865
-Hey there, Bob. See you inside.
-Good to see you guys.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.620
I'm a good soldier for Christ.

38:58.795 --> 39:01.582
And I'm telling you, man,
there's been some kind of mistake.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.418
You're damn right
there's been a mistake, boy.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.876
And it started the minute
your mama spread her legs...

39:08.054 --> 39:11.387
...and pushed out you
and your whore of a sister.

39:14.477 --> 39:18.186
Don't ever talk about my sister.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.391
That the best you can do, sister fucker?

39:39.919 --> 39:44.959
No. That's the best I can do, dick brain.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.768
Forget what I said last week.
Live in the now, baby doll.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.101
-I don't know.
-Because I'm back...

40:02.275 --> 40:04.391
...and I'm packing something wild,
you feel me?

40:04.569 --> 40:05.979
So yes or no, sweetness?

40:06.154 --> 40:09.362
Because this shit is going faster
than fritters at a fat farm.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.490
-I can do half a vial.
-Well, okay.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.654
Is that so?

40:21.336 --> 40:24.203
-Eggs, Tara, y'all seen Sam?
-He ain't here.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.247
Blew off the whole day
with Little Miss Employee-of—the-Month.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.541
Thank you, Jesus, Santa Claus
and Hare Krishna.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.960
-I need to borrow her a minute.
-Wait for me.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.179
Okay.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.765
-Excuse you, it says "ladies" on that door.
-So, what you skank ho's doing in here?

40:40.939 --> 40:46.855
-Watch yourself, bitch.
-I am, and l's is gorgeous.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.612
How's your leg?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.697
Great.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.951
What? I got a powerful immune system.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.533
You got a powerful death wish
is what you got.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.618
And we're gonna talk about this later.

41:08.341 --> 41:10.707
Oh, Tara.

41:10.885 --> 41:16.972
Oh, God, I think | might've done
something bad. Something real bad.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.518
Oh, hey, coming out of your mouth,
that's scary.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.803
So Terry and l, we've been, you know--

41:22.981 --> 41:25.142
-FucMng.
-No.

41:25.316 --> 41:30.026
Well, Lord knows I've been pulling out
all the stops: my hot oils...

41:30.196 --> 41:34.360
...my nasty lingerie. But, you know,
every time we get cozier than first base...

41:34.534 --> 41:37.241
...he goes running
like somebody lit a fire in his whiteys.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.870
Okay, cut to the real bad part.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.452
So last night...

41:44.335 --> 41:47.998
...I thought I'd try getting a few drinks
in him, loosen him up...

41:48.172 --> 41:51.255
...and it seemed like
it was working pretty good.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.666
Till I blacked out.

41:55.430 --> 41:56.840
You blacked out?

41:57.348 --> 42:00.215
Hadn't happened to me
since junior prom.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.386
The thing is...

42:07.608 --> 42:11.772
...I think | might've had my way...

42:12.822 --> 42:15.609
...with him a little bit...

42:16.117 --> 42:20.451
...kind of against his will, maybe.

42:20.621 --> 42:24.113
Are you telling me
you date-raped Terry Bellefleur?

42:25.334 --> 42:28.792
-How's that even possible?
-God, I don't know. But he was just--

42:28.963 --> 42:32.797
He was acting so weird when we woke up.
I mean, weirder than usual.

42:32.967 --> 42:38.883
And there were certain telltale signs
that we'd, you know....

42:39.057 --> 42:42.390
-And you don't remember anything?
-No.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.610
Now, see,
that just ain't motherfucking fair.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.490
Excuse me?

42:56.949 --> 43:00.487
The first time in my goddamn life
I ain't chasing after trouble...

43:03.081 --> 43:07.495
...and itjust keep walking in
my fucking door.

43:07.668 --> 43:11.126
Look at you. Damn.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.289
Ain't nothing good
can come out of something so pretty.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.582
You must be Lafayette.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.004
l'm Eggs.

43:19.055 --> 43:20.966
Tara's Eggs?

43:21.140 --> 43:23.882
You know, thatjust don't sound right.
Your name's Benedict.

43:24.060 --> 43:26.346
-Why don't people call you Ben?
-Or Dict.

43:26.521 --> 43:29.228
-Behave.
-Satan in a Sunday hat, girl.

43:29.398 --> 43:33.812
I'm trying to tell you,
Satan in a beautiful fucking Sunday hat.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.188
Terry.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.028
Terry Bellefleur.

43:38.491 --> 43:39.526
Get out here.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.362
I'm gonna kick your ass so hard,
you'll be shitting boots.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.698
Andy, what happened to your arm?

43:44.872 --> 43:48.205
I ain't talking to you, devil worshiper.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.701
I saw you last night.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.167
-I saw all of you.
-You saw us what?

43:55.341 --> 43:56.456
Go ahead, deny it.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.671
Laugh at the crazy drunk guy.
But I know what I saw.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.677
-Terry.
-He ain't here, Andy.

44:01.848 --> 44:04.464
-You want me to go call him?
-Fuck you, zombie woman.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.805
-Andy.
-Fuck all y'all devil zombies.

44:07.979 --> 44:12.097
Turning this town into an orgy from hell.
I'll stop you.

44:12.275 --> 44:16.314
I will stop you,
if it's the last thing I ever do.

44:17.530 --> 44:21.068
Oh, my God. Did you smell him?

44:21.242 --> 44:24.029
Well, at least
it never gets boring around here.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.068
Pick you up later?

44:26.747 --> 44:28.408
Hey, Sam.

44:30.042 --> 44:33.250
Sam, you look like you just saw a ghost.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.443
Oh, hey.

45:09.165 --> 45:10.780
l was just...

45:11.876 --> 45:13.662
...decorating.

45:16.214 --> 45:19.627
I got these at the gift store downstairs.

45:20.176 --> 45:22.007
They're blood scented.

45:22.178 --> 45:25.045
But to me, theyjust smell like soup.

45:27.183 --> 45:28.298
You like them?

45:30.144 --> 45:31.884
They're perfect.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.310
Well, that's what I was going for.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.313
Because you're perfect,
and I want your first time...

45:43.491 --> 45:47.075
-...to be as perfect as you are.
-Hoyt, just...

45:48.829 --> 45:50.785
...take off your pants.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.788
Okay.

46:12.561 --> 46:15.428
Fuck. Shit.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.519
Jason!

46:21.028 --> 46:22.609
Sarah?

46:23.990 --> 46:27.858
Thank God it's you.
Been running for hours.

46:28.035 --> 46:33.871
Steve and Gabe, they gone crazy.
They tried to kill me.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.042
Oh, Sarah. No.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.557
Finally.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.852
I've missed you.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.566
Thank you...

47:06.741 --> 47:08.857
...for your service.

47:34.435 --> 47:35.971
Gabe.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.227
What happened to your face?

47:39.398 --> 47:41.889
She knows everything,
which never would've happened...

47:42.068 --> 47:44.309
...if you hadn't kept me here
with a mind reader.

47:44.487 --> 47:47.775
Yeah, I hope the reverend knows
that I'm gonna need protection now.

47:47.948 --> 47:50.610
You want protection,
you fangbanging sack of shit?

47:52.495 --> 47:56.534
How's that for protection, huh?
Here's a little more protection for you.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.117
Stop it!

48:03.297 --> 48:07.631
You and your moron brother think
you can make an asshole out of me?

48:07.802 --> 48:11.636
-That's what you think, huh?
-Get your filthy hands off me!

48:11.806 --> 48:14.172
What's wrong?
Your own kind not good enough for you?

48:14.350 --> 48:16.807
How about if I show you
what you've been missing?

48:17.311 --> 48:21.975
--and a decade or so in Miami.

48:22.149 --> 48:28.270
The beaches are gorgeous at night,
and the German tourists are delicious.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.114
Open that door, and I will end you.

48:33.119 --> 48:36.737
I've given you everything. Everything!

48:36.914 --> 48:40.498
And you threw it away,
moaning over what you've lost?

48:40.668 --> 48:42.283
You disgust me.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.997
-Then let me go.
-No.

48:44.171 --> 48:48.835
-I made you, and you are mine.
-You know I don't love you.

48:49.343 --> 48:53.677
-You have never tried.
-I have spent decades trying!

48:53.848 --> 48:56.305
I despise myself for what I did for you.

48:56.475 --> 49:00.093
God help me, I killed innocent people
to prove to you that I loved you.

49:01.397 --> 49:04.013
But it was pure nihilism.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.852
I do not...

49:09.697 --> 49:11.858
.ulcannot”

49:12.700 --> 49:15.191
...I will never love you.

49:20.124 --> 49:24.413
Men have readily laid down their lives...

49:24.587 --> 49:28.705
...to spend just one night with me.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.212
What more can I give?

49:33.596 --> 49:35.712
What is it that you want from me?

49:36.432 --> 49:38.138
Choice.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.683
Let me go.

49:43.772 --> 49:46.024
Without me...

49:46.192 --> 49:49.901
...you would be alone forever.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.979
You're the one that's afraid of that.

49:54.492 --> 49:57.700
You are the saddest, loneliest creature
l have ever known.

49:58.204 --> 50:00.536
How dare you?

50:08.422 --> 50:10.253
You hate me that much?

50:11.300 --> 50:13.040
Let me go.

50:15.721 --> 50:19.088
I cannot live without you.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.715
You will have to.

50:21.894 --> 50:24.010
No,dont

50:30.486 --> 50:32.772
As your maker...

50:36.116 --> 50:38.368
...I release you.

50:42.957 --> 50:46.199
You released me.
There was nothing left between us.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.493
What could you possibly have
to gain from this?

50:48.671 --> 50:52.129
You're making a fool of yourself
with that girl.

50:52.299 --> 50:55.291
You have no future with her.

50:55.761 --> 50:58.252
Everyone knows it but you.

51:01.433 --> 51:04.641
Someday you'll see this for what it is:

51:05.479 --> 51:07.470
an act of love.

51:09.858 --> 51:12.565
-Yes?
-l have a message for Bill Compton.

51:12.736 --> 51:17.070
-He there?
-l'm sorry, he's tied up right now.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.981
I'll be happy to pass it along.

51:20.035 --> 51:23.653
