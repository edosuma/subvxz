00:03.169 --> 00:04.270
Out of my way!!

00:04.270 --> 00:06.306
I've got millions to make!

00:06.306 --> 00:08.842
And I don't want a smelly
car factory

00:08.842 --> 00:10.777
destroying our forest!

00:11.311 --> 00:13.780
When in doubt,
go for their throats!

00:13.780 --> 00:15.749
In this case, their fuel supply.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.150
Ha-haaa!

00:20.453 --> 00:21.021
This is the Evergreen

00:21.021 --> 00:21.154
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.626
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.630
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.465
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:34.234 --> 00:36.002
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.603 --> 00:37.837
Yikes!

00:38.438 --> 00:39.739
Yaaaah...

00:42.308 --> 00:43.843
Yeaaaah!

00:43.843 --> 00:46.946
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.723
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.358 --> 00:59.793
Cyril Sneer!

01:03.229 --> 01:05.398
And his life would be simple
except for...

the Raccoons!!

01:23.550 --> 01:26.886

in for the night.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.458
Except for Cyril Sneer.

01:31.458 --> 01:35.562
And so it is with great
pride that I, Cyril Sneer

01:35.562 --> 01:38.965
present to the press a
brilliant new automobile design,

01:38.965 --> 01:40.633
the Sneermobile.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.938
Designed by the college-trained
mind of my son, Cedric.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.277
Mr. Mammoth:

01:51.277 --> 01:54.447
Providing, of course
that Mr. Mammoth here

01:54.447 --> 01:56.749
sees your car's worth too.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.353
A mere formality, of course.

02:00.353 --> 02:04.724
Imagine it, Mammoth Motors,
mass producing on this site

02:04.724 --> 02:07.260
the biggest car makers
in the universe

02:07.260 --> 02:09.529
at work here, in the
Evergreen Forest.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.398
Of course the forest
will have to make way for my

02:12.398 --> 02:14.400
Sneermobile factory.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.437
Uuuuh...

02:17.437 --> 02:20.940
The car of the future
built by Sneer and Mammoth.

The following day,
Ralph, Melissa and Bert Raccoon

02:28.581 --> 02:32.152
learn some disturbing news
from the morning newspaper.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.321
Cyril Sneer,

02:35.321 --> 02:37.590
teaming with Mammoth Motors?!

02:38.124 --> 02:40.860
To build a huge auto plant here?

02:41.828 --> 02:44.531
This could be the end of
the forest as we know it.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.100
This could be
the end of our way of life.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.136
Hey, this could
be the beginning

02:50.136 --> 02:52.372
of a brand new career!

02:53.006 --> 02:55.375
What?!
A brand new career?

02:55.375 --> 02:58.344
Yeah, Bert Raccoon,

02:58.344 --> 03:00.680
test car driver!

03:01.948 --> 03:03.716
Vroom-vroom-vroom...

03:03.716 --> 03:05.218
But Bert,
don't you understand

03:05.218 --> 03:07.020
the danger of
something like this?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.993
Oh... I do now.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.329
We can't let
Cyril Sneer get away with this.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.703
Hello!
What's that Mammoth?

03:23.703 --> 03:26.139
You test-marketed our idea?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.442
And you don't want a
solar-powered car?

03:29.442 --> 03:32.212
Uhm, uh, oh...

03:32.212 --> 03:35.582
Of course, you don't want
a solar powered car!

03:35.582 --> 03:37.784
How could you sell,
Mammoth gasoline?

03:37.784 --> 03:39.419
You think I didn't
think of that?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.523
That's what I've been
saying all along.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.060
We've got my son Cedric
to blame for this!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.162
There'll be adjustments
made, Mr Mammoth.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.932
Now don't you worry. I'm taking
care of the situation myself.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.067
See you Saturday.

04:04.677 --> 04:08.881
Okay, be careful now,
it's very fragile.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.918
Easy, easy.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.720
Careful!!

04:14.120 --> 04:16.889
Perfect. It's
going to look great.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.460
Cedric?!
Pop?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.195
Get rid of that thing!

04:22.862 --> 04:25.465
But Pop,
that's the solar panel.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.233
It's crucial!

04:27.233 --> 04:29.435
So is
the Mammoth contract.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.903
Get rid of that too.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.174
A solar powered car!?
Ridiculous!

04:35.174 --> 04:37.443
I told you time and time again,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.746
when you were drawing up
those plants, Cedric,

04:39.746 --> 04:43.483
a car has to eat gas!
Belch smoke and burn pavement!

04:43.483 --> 04:45.451
And not necessarily
in that order!

04:45.451 --> 04:48.588
But Pop, you
approved everything.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.257
You must have
caught me in a good mood.

04:51.257 --> 04:54.260
Don't just stand there, start
converting this contraption

04:54.260 --> 04:55.361

04:55.361 --> 04:57.764
The Pig: A road hog!?

04:57.764 --> 05:00.300
The Pigs: Oh good, oh good, Sir!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.634
Strip that body.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.970
Get rid of that
excuse for an engine.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.339
I want a real man's car!

05:06.339 --> 05:08.775
Something oil refineries

05:20.019 --> 05:22.021
Don't worry, Cedric,

05:22.021 --> 05:24.490
maybe your dad will
change his mind.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.492
I don't think so.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.363
Oh, Cedric,

05:30.363 --> 05:32.999
there must be

Hi Cedric, hi Sophia.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.737
Oh, hi, gang!
Hi!

05:37.737 --> 05:39.706
We read about
your father's deal

05:39.706 --> 05:41.641
with Mammoth Motors, Cedric.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.444
Yeah! And I don't
want a smelly car factory

05:44.444 --> 05:46.446

05:48.247 --> 05:50.049
Uh, headache?

05:50.049 --> 05:53.186
Factory? What factory?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.121
The factory your
father's going to build

05:55.121 --> 05:57.390
to manufacture the Sneermobile.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.359
My Sneermobile?!

05:59.359 --> 06:00.793
Huh?

06:00.793 --> 06:04.197

of the Sneermobile?!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.232
The ex-Sneermobile.

06:06.232 --> 06:09.369
It was supposed to be a simple
home assembly model,

06:09.369 --> 06:12.038
but Pop's opted for one
that guzzles gas

06:12.038 --> 06:14.307
and eats stop signs for breakfast.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.811
Hey!!!
What was that?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.882
The Pig: Clear out, clear out!

06:22.882 --> 06:25.218
What's going on here?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.887
The Pig: Can't you see we're
blasting for the test track

06:27.887 --> 06:30.490

trial-run on Saturday?

06:30.490 --> 06:32.091
Clear out, clear out!!

06:34.026 --> 06:36.696
Test track? Trial run?!

06:36.696 --> 06:38.531
It's the contract.

06:38.531 --> 06:42.869
If the Sneermobile passes the
final test run for Mr Mammoth,

06:42.869 --> 06:44.737
Pop will get his contract.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.873
And the green
light for his factory.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.941
But he can't
get that approval.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.077
We've got to do something.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.845
Hmm...

06:52.845 --> 06:55.448
I've got an idea,
that just might work.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.697
We'll be toasting
the town tonight.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.266
How do you like caviar?

13:20.666 --> 13:22.001
Cigar?

13:29.775 --> 13:30.776
The gang:

13:32.011 --> 13:33.012
Hey!!

13:38.617 --> 13:41.253
See? What did I tell you?

13:41.253 --> 13:42.755
She's a born winner!

13:43.489 --> 13:45.191
Prepare to keep the lead!

13:45.191 --> 13:48.494
The Pigs: Yes, Sir, Yes,
- Sir!
- Three bags full!

14:03.509 --> 14:05.477
Huh?! Uh oh.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.687
The Pig: Hold it, hold it,
pull over!

14:19.425 --> 14:22.394
Is everything okay, officer?

14:22.394 --> 14:26.799
The Pig: That's some fancy
driving you was doing, boy!

14:26.799 --> 14:29.401
Y'all got a license?

14:29.401 --> 14:31.170
My.. um-oh-uh.. license?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.805
Uh-what-uhm

14:32.805 --> 14:34.673
Oh, he-he, here it is.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.008
Oops.

14:36.008 --> 14:39.011
The Pig: Oh-oh-uoh-ooh!

14:39.011 --> 14:40.212
Oink!

14:40.212 --> 14:41.347
What?!

14:42.047 --> 14:45.417
Hey, you guys aren't
cops, you're pigs!

14:52.091 --> 14:53.492
The gang:

15:04.336 --> 15:06.572
See? What
did I tell you?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.841
A car with a
healthy appetite?

15:08.841 --> 15:11.343
It'll take that solar toaster

15:11.343 --> 15:12.945
a half-hour to catch up.

15:18.183 --> 15:19.952
What?! Already?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.388
You're doing great, Bert!

15:22.388 --> 15:24.356
Quick.
Let's check the oil.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.426
More brake fluid, it's low.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.029
The solar panels
are holding up well.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.698
All set?
All set!

15:38.804 --> 15:41.907
Now you bungling bundles
of bacon, get this straight

15:41.907 --> 15:44.910
No more foul ups!
Pull out all the stops!

15:44.910 --> 15:47.880
You got that?
All the stops!

15:53.419 --> 15:54.987
And at the halfway mark,

15:54.987 --> 15:57.089
both cars are still in the race.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.559
Wait'll you see the lead
we take in this lap, Mammoth!

16:00.559 --> 16:03.862
Heh! There'll be enough daylight
between us and them

16:03.862 --> 16:05.564
to fill an Arctic summer!

16:33.025 --> 16:34.259
Oiiiink!

16:34.259 --> 16:36.362
The Pig: Wait! Wait, wait!!

16:36.362 --> 16:38.330
Oink!

16:49.808 --> 16:51.844
The Pigs: Uaaaah!

16:53.645 --> 16:55.948
You porkers couldn't
pour water out of a boot,

16:55.948 --> 16:58.150
if the instructions were
written on the heel.

17:03.822 --> 17:06.191
Hey, this is
April, isn't it?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.693
They should be heading north.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.566
The Bear: Quack-quack!

17:18.804 --> 17:19.805
The Bears:

17:36.822 --> 17:39.158
She'll be pulling in
any second now, Mammoth!

17:39.158 --> 17:41.360
Miles ahead of the competition.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.541
What did I tell you?
There she is now!

17:58.644 --> 18:00.279
And here
comes the leader.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.448
Wait, it's, it's, it's, it's...

18:02.448 --> 18:05.017
Bert!!
He's taken the lead!

18:05.751 --> 18:06.852
What?

18:07.653 --> 18:11.657
The gang:

18:17.729 --> 18:18.897
The Pig: Change those tires

18:18.897 --> 18:20.666
and fill her up
with high octane.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.702
Um, excuse me!

18:26.105 --> 18:27.973
You're
doing great, Bert!

18:27.973 --> 18:30.275
Just hold
on for one more lap.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.412
Everything looks okay,
you're all set!

18:38.750 --> 18:39.985
What's going on?

18:39.985 --> 18:42.421
Don't you realize
we have a race to win?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.756
The Pig: But Sir,
she's not ready.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.459
Not ready?!
Here, give me that helmet.

18:48.827 --> 18:49.828
The Pig: But Sir...

18:50.596 --> 18:52.564
It needs an overhaul!!

18:52.564 --> 18:55.567
Out of my way.
I've got millions to make.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.305
The Pig: Oooh!

19:09.081 --> 19:11.183
Incredible,
ladies and gentlemen!

19:11.183 --> 19:13.452
Bert Raccoon looked like
he was out of this race

19:13.452 --> 19:16.955
from the beginning, recovered
from so many great setbacks.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.758
to gain the lead in
this grueling race!

19:19.758 --> 19:21.627
Enough of
this fancy stuff.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.462
Let's get back to basics.

19:23.462 --> 19:26.131
When in doubt, go
for their throats.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.634
In this case, their fuel supply.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.506
Mind if I smoke?

19:35.407 --> 19:37.976
Kiss the sun goodbye, suckers!

19:46.518 --> 19:47.519
The Pig: Oh goody, goody.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.721
Here comes the boss!

19:50.355 --> 19:51.356
Oh!

19:51.356 --> 19:52.991
The Pig: Uh-oh! Oooh!

19:55.060 --> 19:57.196
The Pigs: Oink-oink-oink!

20:00.699 --> 20:04.136
Uh oh!
No sun, I'm stopping.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.340
Time for the backup power!

20:09.841 --> 20:11.476
The Pigs: Uaaaah!
Hurry!

20:11.476 --> 20:13.345
The Pigs: Uaaaah!
Hurry up!

20:13.345 --> 20:14.479
The Pigs: Uaaah!
Huh?!

20:25.757 --> 20:27.359
All right!

20:34.366 --> 20:36.401
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

20:36.401 --> 20:38.670
Time for turbo power!

20:38.670 --> 20:40.772
Ha-haaa!

20:43.609 --> 20:46.712
The Pigs: Uh-ouh-uh-oh!

20:49.214 --> 20:52.017
Their too much

20:52.017 --> 20:53.118
But what's this?

20:56.288 --> 20:58.957
The Sneermobile is
back in the race!

20:58.957 --> 21:01.093
Or what's left of it.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.863
And it's closing fast
on Bert's tail.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.965
What an incredible
turn of events!

21:07.933 --> 21:11.136
It looks like it's going
right down to the wire!

21:11.136 --> 21:13.138
Come on, Bert!

21:13.138 --> 21:15.741
Go, Bert,
you can do it!

21:17.209 --> 21:20.379
And with an incredible
burst of power,

21:20.379 --> 21:22.414
the Sneermobile wins it!!

21:23.448 --> 21:24.916
The Pigs/The Bear:

21:24.916 --> 21:27.486
Hooray, hooray for the boss!

21:31.056 --> 21:34.793
The Bears:

21:34.793 --> 21:37.229
I won! (laughs) I won!

21:45.237 --> 21:47.439
Mr Mammoth says congratulations,

21:47.439 --> 21:49.741
you've got the contract.

21:49.741 --> 21:52.744
The contract.
Of course. I got the contract!

21:54.279 --> 21:55.614
Who's got a pen?

21:55.614 --> 21:57.516
But first, Bert,

21:57.516 --> 22:00.819
Mr. Mammoth would like to
test the car personally.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.487
Me. Me?!

22:02.487 --> 22:05.023
Wha-wh-why.. of course!

22:05.023 --> 22:07.025
What a beauty it is, Sir,

22:07.025 --> 22:09.861
why she drives like a dream.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.531
Bert's car? What?!

22:12.531 --> 22:15.334
That thing?
Wait a minute, I won!

22:15.334 --> 22:18.136
I! Me!! We had a deal.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.440
Mr. Mammoth: Peppy
little number, isn't it?

22:21.440 --> 22:23.275
She sure is.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.044
Mammoth! Mammoth!!

22:26.044 --> 22:28.347
I'll renegotiate.
I'll take a pay cut!

22:28.347 --> 22:31.383
We'll only take 85%. How's that?

22:31.383 --> 22:32.384
Mammoth?!

22:33.685 --> 22:35.287
Mammoth, get back here!

22:35.287 --> 22:37.556
I won fair and square!!

22:37.556 --> 22:40.459
Mammoth! Mammoth!
Come back here!!

22:40.459 --> 22:43.662
Through inspiration,
imagination and teamwork,

22:43.662 --> 22:46.198
Schaeffer and the Raccoons
accomplished quite a lot.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.534
They proved to Mr Mammoth
that he could hedge his bets

22:49.534 --> 22:53.438
with a marketable car that could
be built without a factory,

22:53.438 --> 22:56.074
thereby preserving
the natural beauty

22:56.074 --> 22:57.743
of the Evergreen Forest.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.345
As for Cyril Sneer, well,

23:00.345 --> 23:01.913
not one to miss a trick.

23:01.913 --> 23:04.549
He collected the royalties
on Cedric's design

23:04.549 --> 23:06.251
for years afterwards.
