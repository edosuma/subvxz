This is a big beautiful spot,

03:33.028 --> 03:34.860
there's enough space
for both us, okay?

03:34.862 --> 03:35.864
Beautiful?

03:36.832 --> 03:38.001
You must be kidding.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.869
Why don't we join forces?

03:41.437 --> 03:42.738
I do the singing

03:43.005 --> 03:45.308
and you do the...
whatever it is you're doing.

03:45.741 --> 03:47.677

<i>she was in love
with my brother, Rick.</i>

04:30.119 --> 04:32.488
<i>So I came to Berlin
by myself.</i>

04:33.689 --> 04:35.422
<i>Well, it seemed like
the literary place</i>

04:35.424 --> 04:37.093
<i>to drink myself to death.</i>

04:50.672 --> 04:52.475
<i>I avoided everything.</i>

04:53.809 --> 04:54.944
<i>Everyone.</i>

04:55.544 --> 04:56.679
<i>At all cost.</i>

04:59.415 --> 05:00.682
<i>Berlin was living,</i>

05:01.583 --> 05:02.652
<i>thriving.</i>

05:03.485 --> 05:04.754
<i>But I was a ghost.</i>

05:05.987 --> 05:07.756
<i>Untouched by all.</i>

05:22.437 --> 05:24.571
The price is, uh...

05:24.573 --> 05:26.809
well, it's insane.

05:27.074 --> 05:28.577
How do you want me to pay?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.012
Vanessa makes the decision.

05:33.816 --> 05:36.085
Well, talk to your wife
and let me know.

05:39.554 --> 05:41.824
Help me understand
these Germans.

05:46.694 --> 05:50.596
Oh, come on.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

05:50.598 --> 05:51.932
Sorry.

06:00.141 --> 06:01.476
Who is this?

06:02.744 --> 06:04.513
Vanessa made her decision.

06:10.785 --> 06:13.122
Listen, tell your wife
thank you for choosing me.

06:18.759 --> 06:19.928
I don't have a wife.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.466
Who's Vanessa?

06:24.699 --> 06:26.565
<i>Good afternoon,
Mr. Lander.</i>

06:26.567 --> 06:27.736
<i>I am Vanessa.</i>

06:29.136 --> 06:30.939
Oh, well, I'm Jared.

06:31.138 --> 06:33.006
<i>Where are we going
today, Jared?</i>

06:37.746 --> 06:39.015
<i>You should move.</i>

06:58.033 --> 06:59.035
Oh, God.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.074
Natalie. Thank God.

07:08.076 --> 07:10.076
Listen I've been
going out of my mind.

07:10.078 --> 07:12.846
Listen, just two seconds,
all right?

07:12.848 --> 07:14.814
You blew it.
You totally blew it.

07:14.816 --> 07:16.148
Thanks for nothing.

07:16.150 --> 07:18.151
Well,
I didn't do anything.

07:18.153 --> 07:21.555
You complained
to Frau Gruber about me.

07:21.557 --> 07:23.656
And you know that Frau Gruber

07:23.658 --> 07:25.091
is best friends with Herr Zimmer

07:25.093 --> 07:28.093
who will of course report this
to Fraulein Platz.

07:28.095 --> 07:30.797
One more complaint
and I get das boot.

07:30.799 --> 07:31.732
No, no, no, no.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.936
Look, I can't deal
with this right now.

07:34.268 --> 07:35.537
You're gonna have to leave.

07:36.672 --> 07:37.807
I'm keeping
an eye on you. What's your name?

07:38.206 --> 07:39.575
Uh, Jared.

07:40.107 --> 07:42.208
I'm Rose. How do you do?

07:44.579 --> 07:45.881
Oh, that is here.

07:46.148 --> 07:48.551
The new fragrance for men
by Gio.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.687
Natalie, look, I'm so sorry.

07:53.689 --> 07:55.754
- <i>Jared.</i>
- Look, this whole time apart...

07:55.756 --> 07:57.723
- <i>Jared.</i>
- Everything is so much clearer

07:57.725 --> 07:59.893
- now, don't you think?
- <i>Jared, stop. Listen.</i>

07:59.895 --> 08:01.764
<i>Your brother and I
are getting married.</i>

08:07.336 --> 08:08.537
<i>Jared?</i>

08:12.740 --> 08:14.576
Take me to the nearest bridge.

08:29.925 --> 08:31.190
What? What the...

08:31.192 --> 08:33.595
<i>I am loaded
with several safety features.</i>

08:34.328 --> 08:36.030
Why did you stop the car?

08:36.330 --> 08:38.298
Vanessa, why did you stop
the car?

08:38.299 --> 08:39.265
<i>She's not worth it,</i>

08:39.267 --> 08:41.201
<i>the girl that brought you
to this.</i>

08:41.203 --> 08:43.336
<i>Excuse me for saying this,
but she's a bitch.</i>

08:43.337 --> 08:44.270
Vanessa!

08:44.272 --> 08:45.304
<i>I am a Berliner, Jared.</i>

08:45.306 --> 08:47.706
<i>We are not known
for soft language.</i>

08:47.708 --> 08:49.911
<i>She's a bitch.
You will forget her in time.</i>

08:50.911 --> 08:53.278
Wait. Wait.
Is this in your program?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.815
<i>Those of us who
do not have the gift of life,</i>

08:55.817 --> 08:57.352
<i>truly envy the value of it.</i>

08:59.688 --> 09:03.159
No, no, no, no, no.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.362
No, no, no.

09:07.061 --> 09:10.429
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:10.431 --> 09:12.233
You shouldn't be saying that.

09:12.434 --> 09:14.134
No, no, no, no.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.805
Saying anything
but programmed responses.

09:18.973 --> 09:20.075
No, no, no.

09:21.108 --> 09:22.110
No, no.

09:23.111 --> 09:24.713
Stop following me.

09:24.979 --> 09:26.348
Stop it.

09:31.319 --> 09:34.155
<i>You aren't thinking
of killing yourself anymore.</i>

09:37.324 --> 09:39.926
<i>When faced with the mysteries
of the universe,</i>

09:39.928 --> 09:41.897
<i>life once again
seems appealing.</i>

09:43.397 --> 09:44.733
What do you want?

09:45.834 --> 09:46.801

12:53.188 --> 12:54.888
Oh, thank God.
You're still there.

12:54.890 --> 12:56.422
Vanessa, I'm so sorry.

12:56.424 --> 12:59.558
<i>Destination, please?
Destination, please?</i>

12:59.560 --> 13:01.260

13:16.611 --> 13:18.581
It's about Vanessa.

13:19.014 --> 13:20.312
She's not talking to me.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.223
Oh,
you really did it this time.

13:27.454 --> 13:29.022
They kicked me out!

13:29.024 --> 13:29.889
Why?

13:29.891 --> 13:31.591
They said
I make too much noise

13:31.593 --> 13:33.929
with the furniture
and I do funny voices.

13:34.261 --> 13:36.095
Well, you do make funny voices.

13:36.097 --> 13:38.464
I move furniture
around late at night

13:38.466 --> 13:40.332
because I've nothing else to do.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.937
I don't know anyone
here in this city.

13:50.645 --> 13:53.549
I'm just a voice-over actor,
trying to get some work.

13:55.116 --> 13:57.119
I'm just practicing
cartoon characters.

13:58.218 --> 13:59.588
Oh, Stanley,

Why?

Because I wanna
show you my Berlin!

15:33.680 --> 15:34.714
Okay.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.418
- <i>Adorable...</i>
- Coming.

15:36.617 --> 15:39.487
<i>...avoid-at-all-costs Rose.</i>

16:00.775 --> 16:02.211
Go away.

16:04.145 --> 16:05.477
I'll pay for it,
you know.

16:05.479 --> 16:07.215
How? With a prayer?

16:08.817 --> 16:10.753
Where did you put
your vodka, comrade?

16:11.352 --> 16:12.487
Vodka is out.

16:15.522 --> 16:16.624
Then give me whiskey.

16:17.391 --> 16:18.593
Out too.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.094
Come on, Michail.
Stop playing games with me here.

16:21.096 --> 16:22.398
Sorry. Can't do it.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.630
Didn't you say I reminded you
of your older brother?

16:25.632 --> 16:27.069
Is this how you treat a brother?

16:27.267 --> 16:28.768
No wonder he died.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.537
He didn't die.
We saved his life.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.074
Me and the whole family.

16:33.507 --> 16:34.773
No money anymore for drinks.

16:34.775 --> 16:36.408
He was crying like little baby,

16:36.410 --> 16:38.414
trying to carve himself
with his knife.

16:39.314 --> 16:41.114
Now, he's working
for Google.

16:41.116 --> 16:44.116
Michail, I really had
a bad day, okay?

16:44.118 --> 16:45.521
You sound exactly like him.

16:45.886 --> 16:47.256
I'll pay for it.

16:49.723 --> 16:50.658
Are you sure?

16:51.391 --> 16:52.658
He's not an angel.

16:52.660 --> 16:53.793
It's just costume.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.564
You heard her. The lady pays.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.398
Good-karma girl, huh?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.402
So?

17:01.835 --> 17:03.504
It's 11.99.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.145
You're making me feel
really bad here.

17:10.912 --> 17:13.482
Actually, worse than our
Russian dissident just did.

17:14.281 --> 17:16.385
Hey, I'm just inviting
an angel for a drink.

17:17.519 --> 17:18.685
You're right, Michail,

17:19.354 --> 17:20.720
the last thing to go

17:20.722 --> 17:22.089
is really a man's pride.

17:35.403 --> 17:37.470
His mom's gonna
be back in a few days.

17:37.472 --> 17:40.173
She might not be. His brother
is still in the hospital.

17:40.175 --> 17:42.775
Yeah. But, moving him now,
it's gonna devastate him.

17:42.777 --> 17:44.844
This is another new place
with more new people.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.711
I think he's never
going to see them again.

17:46.713 --> 17:48.748
Look, it's not ideal.
I'm not arguing that.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.586
But they're not gonna
let him stay here.

18:17.311 --> 18:18.678
Excuse me?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.744
Yeah?

18:19.746 --> 18:20.779
Um, chicken.

18:20.781 --> 18:21.782
Chicken? Yes.

18:28.423 --> 18:30.659
Liv, um, Nisar Raslan,

18:30.892 --> 18:33.226
is there any way we can make
an exception for him?

18:33.228 --> 18:34.492
- Who?
- The, uh, little boy

18:34.494 --> 18:36.494
who's younger brother
is in the hospital.

18:36.496 --> 18:38.230
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:38.232 --> 18:40.365
Could we possibly let him
stay here one more night?

18:40.367 --> 18:43.405
I wish we could
but absolutely not.

18:43.905 --> 18:47.940
We can call the Jugendamt
ask not to try and place him

18:47.942 --> 18:50.875
until we know when the mother
will be returning.

18:50.877 --> 18:53.514
But he can't stay here
unchaperoned.

21:01.108 --> 21:03.008
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.377
I can't believe
you don't have olive oil here.

21:05.379 --> 21:07.413
I mean, how can you cook
without olive oil,

21:07.415 --> 21:08.517
the base of all...

21:09.916 --> 21:10.985
what's this?

21:11.685 --> 21:12.920
This is Nisar.

21:15.155 --> 21:16.390
Hello.

21:19.126 --> 21:20.796
Do you wanna sit down?

21:22.896 --> 21:25.530
Oh, do you want
something to drink?

21:25.532 --> 21:27.601
Like, uh...
I only got water.

21:27.801 --> 21:29.704
Water? No?

21:30.037 --> 21:31.006
Okay.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.675
So, is he from the shelter?

21:36.644 --> 21:38.914
I know what I think
you might like.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.818
Well... is he?

21:43.151 --> 21:45.087
No. I picked him up
in an alleyway.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.822
Here, look.

21:55.195 --> 21:56.694
Could you just stop
with the Arabic

21:56.696 --> 21:58.099
long enough to tell me
what's going on?

21:59.200 --> 22:00.365
Well, he only
understands Arabic.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.971
It's the only thing he has
in his life he hasn't lost.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.441
And is he staying here?

22:07.742 --> 22:09.944
Should we go
outside for a second?

22:11.846 --> 22:13.415
Two seconds, okay?

22:19.453 --> 22:20.553
Look, he's just here
for the night.

22:20.555 --> 22:22.855
His little brother is in
the hospital with pneumonia.

22:22.857 --> 22:23.990
And his mom is staying with him.

22:23.992 --> 22:26.759
I can't leave him in the shelter
alone. It's not allowed.

22:26.761 --> 22:28.029
Well, what about his father?

22:28.628 --> 22:30.128
Well, his father
didn't come with them.

22:30.130 --> 22:32.131
And they were going to
give him to child services.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.232
If he goes to child services,
I don't know how long

22:34.234 --> 22:36.067
it will be before I can
get him back to his mom.

22:36.069 --> 22:37.068
So, he's staying the night here?

22:37.070 --> 22:39.974
Yes. It's just one night.
That's what it is.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.642
Oh, when you're in the
hospital with pneumonia

22:43.644 --> 22:46.013
you were there for two weeks,
remember? What then?

22:46.746 --> 22:48.482
We didn't catch it
in time.

22:48.883 --> 22:50.184
He isn't going to live
that long.

22:51.018 --> 22:52.854
Oh, God.

22:54.489 --> 22:55.557
Oh.

22:56.523 --> 22:58.190
Oh, God. Jane, what are you
putting yourself

22:58.192 --> 22:59.493
into the middle of?

23:00.595 --> 23:02.731
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

23:04.499 --> 23:05.800
<i>Woo-hoo.</i>

23:16.511 --> 23:18.743
I mean, are you even
allowed to bring him here?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.145
You... maybe you could lose
your job for this.

23:21.147 --> 23:23.147
Mom, can you please
remember that he's watching?

23:23.149 --> 23:25.183
Well, I thought you said
he only understands Arabic?

23:25.185 --> 23:26.818
No.
He can understand tone.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.721
He can understand everything.

23:28.723 --> 23:31.693
Jane, just think
what you're taking on here.

23:37.697 --> 23:39.967
All right. All right.
I'm done. I'm done.

23:41.068 --> 23:42.835
It'd be nice
to have another guest.

23:42.837 --> 23:44.873
Look. I cooked for you.

23:47.073 --> 23:49.074
Lemon roast chicken.
You're favorite.

23:49.076 --> 23:50.808
You cooked?
Why did you cook?

23:50.810 --> 23:53.178
I didn't ask you to cook.
I didn't ask you to buy that.

23:53.180 --> 23:55.280
I didn't ask you
to buy all this.

23:55.282 --> 23:56.885
I like my apartment
with nothing in it.

24:04.058 --> 24:05.059
Sorry.

24:07.228 --> 24:08.997
It smells great. It's...

24:11.933 --> 24:12.964
Oh, shit.

24:12.966 --> 24:14.700
- What?
- Oh, shit.

24:14.702 --> 24:16.935
No, no, no.
I've just been really stupid.

24:16.937 --> 24:18.604
- I am...
- What darling?

24:18.606 --> 24:20.838
No. I...
I had plans for tonight.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.641
I'm meant to cancel.
I forgot to cancel it.

24:22.643 --> 24:24.512
No. No. Don't cancel.

24:24.712 --> 24:26.178
No. You go.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.012
- I can look after the boy.
- Don't be silly.

24:28.014 --> 24:29.714
I can't just leave him
here with you.

24:29.716 --> 24:31.584
- Why not?
- What do you mean why not?

24:31.586 --> 24:33.285
He doesn't know you.
He wouldn't be comfortable.

24:33.287 --> 24:35.186
I can look after a little boy.

24:35.188 --> 24:37.589
You go out. You go out.
Have some fun.

24:37.591 --> 24:39.761
Why? What was so important
about me going out?

24:40.027 --> 24:41.961
Oh, well, I don't know.

24:41.963 --> 24:43.828
The thought of you
maybe having some fun.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.332
I mean, the way you spend
your life here...

24:46.334 --> 24:48.236
Well, how?
How do I spend my life here?

24:49.604 --> 24:51.806
Surrounded by so much
unhappiness.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.973
You've come all the way
here to Berlin,

24:54.975 --> 24:56.275
to this little apartment.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.277
You work all hours
of the day and night.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.614
You never eat.
You never sleep.

25:00.714 --> 25:03.248
You deal with things
that are out of your control.

25:03.250 --> 25:06.151
So, yes, actually,
the thought of you going out,

25:06.153 --> 25:08.086
having some fun,
maybe meeting someone

25:08.088 --> 25:09.256
is bloody marvelous.

25:09.991 --> 25:12.156
Okay. That's it.
Meeting someone.

25:12.158 --> 25:14.259
So, it's... what?
I might get married,

25:14.261 --> 25:16.628
move back to London,
have a couple of grand kids,

25:16.630 --> 25:18.966
give you much brighter
Facebook posts?

25:19.332 --> 25:22.036
Yes.
As a matter of fact, yes.

25:23.303 --> 25:25.839
Oh, Jane, I just
want you to grow up.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.775
I know what you're doing here
is very noble,

25:29.777 --> 25:31.112
very well-meaning,

25:31.311 --> 25:32.780
but you're running away.

25:33.047 --> 25:34.316
It's an escape.

25:36.050 --> 25:38.384
It is not an escape.

25:38.386 --> 25:39.984
This is reality.

25:39.986 --> 25:41.221
This is Berlin.

25:41.655 --> 25:43.791
This is what life is right now.

25:44.157 --> 25:46.692
And I know that the whole
of the rest of the world

25:46.694 --> 25:48.597
want to pretend that it isn't,

25:48.995 --> 25:49.997
but it is.

25:51.065 --> 25:53.802
No one's pretending.
God, Jane, life is so short.

25:54.868 --> 25:56.303
I mean, it's gone in a flash.

25:57.203 --> 25:59.374
Don't throw everything
away for this.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.044
Okay. Uh...

26:05.680 --> 26:06.815
you know what?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.183
I am gonna go out.

26:09.216 --> 26:13.152
Um, Nizar, I'm gonna
go out for an hour, okay?

26:13.154 --> 26:14.319
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go out.

26:14.321 --> 26:17.088
And you've got to stay here
with my mom. Is that okay?

26:17.090 --> 26:18.691
And then you can eat
something here.

26:18.693 --> 26:20.224
And you can watch cartoons.

26:20.226 --> 26:22.161
And then, um...
and then I'm gonna be back,

26:22.163 --> 26:23.862
okay? Okay.
But just one hour.

26:23.864 --> 26:25.698
Um, if he... if he freaks out,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.066
- or if he needs me...
- I'll call.

26:27.068 --> 26:28.269
Fine. Okay.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.282
Okay.

28:08.202 --> 28:10.438
Your brother?

30:02.148 --> 30:03.448
Can I come in?

30:03.450 --> 30:04.886
Uh-hmm. Yeah.

30:06.953 --> 30:08.522
So, did you have a good time?

30:10.323 --> 30:11.859
Yeah, it was fine.

30:14.161 --> 30:16.060
I just want you to be happy.

30:16.062 --> 30:17.998
Oh, mum, please, not now.

30:18.464 --> 30:20.332
Yes. Yes.

30:20.334 --> 30:22.467
Now, that boy in there...

30:22.469 --> 30:24.670
No, look, look.
Could you go for anything?

30:24.672 --> 30:26.605
But please,
don't go for him? Okay?

30:26.607 --> 30:28.475
That's what his mother
wants for him.

30:29.710 --> 30:31.379
You see, it's all there.

30:31.678 --> 30:33.213
And how she raised him.

30:35.982 --> 30:37.585
You know, in all of my life,

30:39.219 --> 30:40.685
including before you,

30:40.687 --> 30:45.092
I have never felt more certain
of why I was.

30:49.730 --> 30:51.199
I'm very proud of you.

31:36.777 --> 31:38.112
Wait a second.

31:39.613 --> 31:41.015
Could you hold this for me?

31:42.616 --> 31:43.682
Sure.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.086
Thanks.

31:47.287 --> 31:49.121
Wouldn't this be the moment now

31:49.123 --> 31:50.290
to tell me your name?

31:51.090 --> 31:52.260
I'm Sara.

31:54.060 --> 31:55.163
I'm Damiel.

31:58.165 --> 31:59.434
Where are you from, Sara?

32:01.367 --> 32:02.569
I'm from Israel.

32:03.669 --> 32:04.671
And you?

32:05.438 --> 32:06.573
<i>Ich bin ein Berliner.</i>

32:07.808 --> 32:09.042
At least until tomorrow.

32:10.043 --> 32:11.211
I don't understand.

32:12.578 --> 32:13.744
I've had enough.

32:13.746 --> 32:14.715
I'm fed up.

32:15.715 --> 32:17.115
Why?

32:17.117 --> 32:18.519
It's a pretty long story.

32:20.453 --> 32:22.490
Well, you know what?
I have time.

32:27.761 --> 32:29.297
Do you have a place to stay?

32:30.196 --> 32:31.732
Do you have a place to stay?

32:39.572 --> 32:41.074
What does this say?

32:45.611 --> 32:46.611
Which means?

32:46.613 --> 32:49.213
This house used to be
in a different country.

32:52.219 --> 32:54.622
Are we in East Berlin
or West Berlin right now?

32:55.155 --> 32:57.157
Definitely West.

32:58.224 --> 33:00.092
Hey, can you show me
the Berlin Wall?

33:01.595 --> 33:03.327
You're right on top of it.

33:03.329 --> 33:04.398
No way.

33:04.764 --> 33:06.230
Can you feel it?

33:06.232 --> 33:07.635
No.

33:10.337 --> 33:11.338
God!

33:12.772 --> 33:14.242
Yeah, I can feel it now.

33:30.656 --> 33:32.124
Hello.

33:34.661 --> 33:35.727
Thank you.

33:35.729 --> 33:37.265
So, what's shakin', baby?

33:38.598 --> 33:39.800
Are you serious?

33:41.501 --> 33:43.271
You're gonna hit me
with that line?

33:43.503 --> 33:45.338
Why not?

33:46.906 --> 33:48.376
I like your style.

33:50.844 --> 33:51.846
Classy.

33:52.245 --> 33:53.280
Hmm.

33:53.646 --> 33:55.814
You must be some
sort of professional.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.718
Nope,
just an American.

33:58.484 --> 33:59.619
Do you mind?

34:00.386 --> 34:01.688
Do I have a say in that?

34:02.388 --> 34:04.157
What?

34:05.291 --> 34:07.826
Baby, you just set
your movement back 50 years.

34:07.828 --> 34:10.226
What movement?
I don't have a movement.

34:10.228 --> 34:12.300
I don't have time.
I work for a living.

34:12.697 --> 34:14.799
And by the way,
a lot of women wear suits,

34:14.801 --> 34:15.768
you know, old man.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.638
- I am not that old.
- Uh-hmm.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.438
And you're a very funny lady.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.275
Jesus,
don't call me that. Lady.

34:24.277 --> 34:26.409
Otherwise, we're gonna have
real problems between us.

34:26.411 --> 34:28.846
If I don't, does that mean
we're gonna get along

34:28.848 --> 34:30.848
- and be friends?
- Look at this, first base,

34:30.850 --> 34:32.518
and you didn't even
buy me a drink.

34:33.219 --> 34:35.121
Okay. Where I come from,

34:35.688 --> 34:37.324
first base is a kiss.

34:44.464 --> 34:45.466
Oh.

34:46.264 --> 34:47.333
Whoa!

34:47.734 --> 34:49.466
Holy shit. I didn't expect that.

34:49.467 --> 34:50.469
No promises.

34:51.304 --> 34:52.373
Why me?

34:52.606 --> 34:53.938
Don't sell yourself short.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.540
You're not too bad yourself.

34:55.542 --> 34:58.212
So...

34:58.644 --> 35:00.213
let's talk about you.

35:00.948 --> 35:02.917
- What?
- Let's talk about you.

35:03.450 --> 35:06.218
Oh, rock and roll.

35:06.220 --> 35:07.221
Anything you want, baby.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.292
So, what's your name?

35:13.359 --> 35:14.825
That's me, not you.

35:14.827 --> 35:16.463
You're a real piece of work.

35:17.296 --> 35:19.330
I can make up anything,
what does it matter?

35:19.332 --> 35:20.635
Nothing matters.

35:21.868 --> 35:24.505
Fine. I'll pick one.
How about...

35:25.504 --> 35:26.770
Heather?

35:26.772 --> 35:27.807
Call me Heather.

35:28.374 --> 35:29.506
No, not that one.

35:29.508 --> 35:30.309
Why not?

35:30.910 --> 35:33.377
I once had a little girl
a long time ago.

35:33.379 --> 35:34.582
Her name was Heather.

35:35.281 --> 35:36.684
And I never got to know her.

35:37.484 --> 35:39.520
And I have a father.
What a coincidence.

35:40.854 --> 35:42.223
Hmm.

35:43.890 --> 35:44.892
Well...

35:46.459 --> 35:48.195
Just out of curiosity,

35:48.928 --> 35:51.831
what would you say
your odds are right about now?

35:53.533 --> 35:54.801
Fifty-fifty?

35:57.771 --> 35:59.272
Fifty-fifty?

36:00.906 --> 36:01.908
Yeah.

36:02.876 --> 36:04.709
Look at you,
you sneaky bastard.

36:04.711 --> 36:06.314
You really think so?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.446
- Fifty-fifty?
- Listen,

36:08.448 --> 36:10.850
everything always
comes down to fifty-fifty.

36:11.417 --> 36:13.752
You know, it's either gonna
happen or it's not gonna happen.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.520
- Right?
- Hmm.

36:15.522 --> 36:17.458
I mean, either
I'm gonna get lucky and...

36:18.292 --> 36:19.991
take you back to my hotel room

36:19.993 --> 36:20.995
- and...
- Uh-hmm.

36:21.827 --> 36:23.528
Love you till your eyeballs roll

36:23.530 --> 36:24.832
in the back of your head or...

36:25.665 --> 36:27.564
I'm gonna go home
and play with myself.

36:27.566 --> 36:28.899
- Hmm.
- I ain't got

36:28.901 --> 36:30.604
the answers,
I ain't got no crystal ball.

36:30.836 --> 36:32.937
Something is either
gonna happen or it's not.

36:32.939 --> 36:34.406
Yeah, I guess so.

36:34.408 --> 36:35.509
I like that.

36:35.841 --> 36:38.977
So, who or what
didn't work out for you

36:38.979 --> 36:40.714
that you're here right now?

36:41.647 --> 36:42.850
You wanna listen?

36:44.017 --> 36:46.484
Sure. My flight's
not till tomorrow.

36:46.486 --> 36:47.488
Oh.

36:49.423 --> 36:52.260
I really like you, Heather.

36:54.428 --> 36:56.694
You know, any woman
who's ever cared about me

36:56.696 --> 36:57.865
or love me, I...

36:59.832 --> 37:01.968
I hurt and caused them
a lot of pain.

37:02.736 --> 37:04.705
And I don't ever
wanna do that again.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.372
You sound like a man who has
a problem with forgiveness.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.040
Yeah. Big time.

37:10.042 --> 37:11.979
You should start
by forgiving yourself.

37:12.511 --> 37:14.615
Yeah. That's what
my priest tells me.

37:18.551 --> 37:20.584
I mean, what I regret most is,
uh, you know,

37:20.586 --> 37:23.587
I had the kid a long time ago,
and I never got to know her.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.957
What do you mean,
had a kid? How?

37:25.959 --> 37:27.859
Well,
I get hooked up with this girl.

37:27.861 --> 37:30.698
We were young, we had a baby.
And she split with the kid.

37:34.968 --> 37:36.734
What would you say to her?

37:39.439 --> 37:41.105
What would you say
to your little girl?

37:41.107 --> 37:42.874
Say, she walked into here
right now,

37:42.876 --> 37:44.778
into this dipshit
hotel bar?

37:45.611 --> 37:47.947
And sat down here
and looked at you, and said...

37:48.781 --> 37:50.415
"Daddy, I forgive you,

37:50.417 --> 37:52.319
if you give me
one good reason to."

37:53.653 --> 37:54.789
What would you say?

37:58.457 --> 37:59.559
What would you say?

38:01.026 --> 38:02.696
You know what I did for years?

38:05.631 --> 38:07.400
I used to pretend that...

38:08.535 --> 38:10.738
I'll be on a street corner
and I would just be...

38:11.171 --> 38:13.774
watching people walk by
and I used to pretend that...

38:14.540 --> 38:16.441
I'd see somebody,

38:16.443 --> 38:19.412
some guy who would be holding
hands with a little girl,

38:20.446 --> 38:21.816
they'd walk up to me

38:22.415 --> 38:23.684
and the little girl would be...

38:24.184 --> 38:25.553
my little girl.

38:25.785 --> 38:26.986
And she'd say...

38:27.586 --> 38:28.787
"Hi, daddy."

38:28.789 --> 38:30.658
<i>♪</i> <i>♪</i>

38:31.124 --> 38:34.758
And I'd pick her up
and I'll hold her, and just say,

38:34.760 --> 38:36.461
"I didn't know where you were.

38:36.463 --> 38:38.466
I didn't know how to find you.

38:38.964 --> 38:40.832
And I love you so much.

38:40.834 --> 38:42.870
And, and I missed you
my whole life, and...

38:44.037 --> 38:46.107
I can't believe
you're here right now."

38:46.772 --> 38:48.475
And I would hear her voice say,

38:48.975 --> 38:51.912
"Daddy, am I still the prettiest
little girl in the world?"

38:52.178 --> 38:53.881
And I'd say, "Yeah,

38:54.481 --> 38:57.517
you are the prettiest
little girl in the world.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.555
And I missed you so much."

39:03.923 --> 39:07.625
"Daddy... I missed you so much."

39:11.097 --> 39:12.966
I'm done talking about this.

39:16.202 --> 39:18.738
So, where...
where shall we continue?

39:19.738 --> 39:20.740
What?

39:23.542 --> 39:25.479
This, where shall we go next?

45:57.537 --> 45:59.138
Where is it? The house.

there tonight

46:07.080 --> 46:08.415

No.

52:56.856 --> 52:58.425
Nothing's typical Berlin.

53:36.562 --> 53:37.897
You smell that?

53:41.334 --> 53:43.502
Cabbage, burnt coal,

53:44.102 --> 53:45.371

Esther.

Esther Zinger.

54:23.142 --> 54:25.345
Rudi, David,

54:25.678 --> 54:28.048
Shula, Selma.

54:29.515 --> 54:30.650
She survived.

54:31.751 --> 54:33.319
She's 95 years old now.

54:33.852 --> 54:35.789
And she wanted me
to take pictures.

54:39.557 --> 54:42.094
How in the world
can you come here to the city

54:43.396 --> 54:44.694

54:44.696 --> 54:46.532
I don't have these bad memories.

54:51.069 --> 54:52.504
Listen, um...

54:53.571 --> 54:55.809
I got my last gig
before I leave town tonight,

54:56.175 --> 54:57.443
you wanna come?

55:23.769 --> 55:25.972

you fucking <i>Arschloch.</i>

55:37.450 --> 55:38.818
Uh, that's okay.

55:39.151 --> 55:40.419
I'll make you a coffee.

55:49.028 --> 55:50.397
What's up with him?

55:53.231 --> 55:55.499
He's been here
for two days now.

55:56.635 --> 55:59.906
One more day, and I'll bury him.

56:01.173 --> 56:02.872
And we'll see what happens.

56:06.879 --> 56:08.114
What's your plan now?

56:12.551 --> 56:13.586
I don't know.

56:15.254 --> 56:16.522
Uh...

56:17.923 --> 56:21.127
I'm tired of his, uh...

56:22.660 --> 56:26.165
just always arguing,
and, uh... yelling.

56:27.633 --> 56:29.636
Uh, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

56:49.588 --> 56:52.089
You cannot put
that beautiful dress

56:52.091 --> 56:53.656
into the machine.

56:53.658 --> 56:54.927
It's dirty.

56:55.961 --> 56:57.030
Hmm?

56:59.231 --> 57:02.035
Hey, come on.
You'll ruin it.

57:03.801 --> 57:05.171
I don't care.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.676
Looks clean to me.

57:10.008 --> 57:11.644
It's not dirty.

57:17.283 --> 57:18.952
Well, it just needs a repair.

57:26.792 --> 57:27.894
Here.

57:28.593 --> 57:29.828
You cannot be naked.

57:39.872 --> 57:41.107
I came here...

57:41.673 --> 57:43.275
to do my first photo shoot.

57:46.278 --> 57:48.982
I thought that this would be
my big break.

57:51.984 --> 57:54.854
There was no one else,
except for the photographer.

57:57.189 --> 57:58.725
I'm so stupid.

58:00.959 --> 58:01.994
It's not your fault.

58:04.263 --> 58:06.232
He told me to take my dress off.

58:08.267 --> 58:09.301
And then?

58:10.769 --> 58:13.138
I ran out, knocked the camera
out of the way.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.009
I hope it was his favorite.

58:29.321 --> 58:31.988
Always this busy
on a Saturday night?

58:31.990 --> 58:33.290
This is Berlin.

58:33.292 --> 58:35.595
I wouldn't bat an eye
if the Pope came in.

58:41.633 --> 58:43.802
You have to do your laundry
to be here.

59:06.725 --> 59:08.392
Excuse me,
but I have to ask.

59:08.394 --> 59:10.993
- You look very...
- I'm here for the party.

59:10.995 --> 59:13.165
- Are you having a party?
- No.

59:15.133 --> 59:18.401
My friend, Andres from Caracas

59:18.403 --> 59:20.806
gave me this address,
and said...

59:21.305 --> 59:23.208
this was a place to be tonight.

59:24.176 --> 59:27.044
I think your friend Andres
from Caracas

59:27.046 --> 59:28.314
is having some fun with you.

59:28.781 --> 59:31.784
Oh, no. Andres never
gets it wrong.

59:38.890 --> 59:40.126
So, did he hurt you?

59:41.392 --> 59:42.694
No, he...

59:43.696 --> 59:44.664
I'm...

59:46.198 --> 59:47.367
He just...

59:48.367 --> 59:50.870
kept telling me
that he will help me out.

59:53.305 --> 59:55.305
I always wondered
what I would do

59:55.307 --> 59:56.743
in this situation.

01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:01.713
Everything just...

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:03.716
slows down.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.883
He started arguing,

01:00:07.885 --> 01:00:09.755
and I knew
I just had to get out.

01:00:10.923 --> 01:00:12.392
Who would you expect?

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:13.959
Men chase women.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.861
It's part of the game.

01:00:19.897 --> 01:00:22.232
You know, the men think
that they can do what they want

01:00:22.234 --> 01:00:23.670
because of women like you.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:25.937
You don't believe
it's the truth?

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.140
No, I didn't understand
this movement.

01:00:30.142 --> 01:00:31.944
I supposed I believe
in sisterhood.

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:35.511
As long as we
don't punish the man

01:00:35.513 --> 01:00:36.883
who isn't guilty.

01:00:44.156 --> 01:00:45.921
Am I clear? Yeah.

01:00:45.923 --> 01:00:47.424
No, that, that...

01:00:47.426 --> 01:00:49.896
yeah, that bitch whore
at my premiere.

01:00:50.461 --> 01:00:52.464
I'm gonna make sure
she never works again.

01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:56.035
Welcome to my laundromat.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.537
Welcome to my laundromat.

01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:01.904
Right.

01:01:01.906 --> 01:01:03.408
Uh, can you take care of this?

01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:07.780
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

01:01:08.147 --> 01:01:10.817
Oh, he's that...

01:01:11.182 --> 01:01:12.982
casting couch director.

01:01:12.984 --> 01:01:15.886
Yeah. Antonio,
Artenio...

01:01:15.888 --> 01:01:17.854
No, Artemis. Artemis.

01:01:17.856 --> 01:01:19.455
- Arte...
- Sorach.

01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:21.191
- Artemis, Sorach.
- This is him.

01:01:21.193 --> 01:01:23.192
And, and I was accused,
nothing was proven.

01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:24.928
There were a few women, right?

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:27.564
Yeah, there were about
20 who had all the same stories.

01:01:27.566 --> 01:01:30.232
Excuse me, why, why, why is this
any of your business?

01:01:30.234 --> 01:01:31.401
Huh, why?

01:01:31.403 --> 01:01:33.136
It is my business because
my boyfriend

01:01:33.138 --> 01:01:35.872
beat the shit out of me,
and I'm sick of men like you.

01:01:35.874 --> 01:01:37.477
- What did you do?
- What?

01:01:37.975 --> 01:01:40.075
What, what did you do to, to
provoke him?

01:01:40.077 --> 01:01:41.944
- What did she do?
- I'm saying.

01:01:41.946 --> 01:01:44.980
What did she do?
There's nothing a woman can do

01:01:44.982 --> 01:01:46.816
that would excuse a man
hitting her?

01:01:46.818 --> 01:01:49.419
Oh, no. I agree, I agree.
Look, I'm a feminist.

01:01:49.421 --> 01:01:51.587
I love women.
My mother was a woman.

01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:53.223
I've done a lot for women.

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:55.294
All my assistants are women.

01:01:55.827 --> 01:01:57.894
Now, they... they use me,
they come to me

01:01:57.896 --> 01:02:00.533
because, because I have money,
and I have power,

01:02:00.966 --> 01:02:03.399
and they wanna use me
to get ahead.

01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:05.167
I'm the victim here.

01:02:05.169 --> 01:02:07.037
- See? Look.
- Bullshit.

01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:08.537
I... I don't make the rules.

01:02:08.539 --> 01:02:09.975
You just enjoy them.

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:12.308
Listen,

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:14.046
I love men who...

01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:17.546
open doors and bring me flowers

01:02:17.548 --> 01:02:19.883
that smell like wilderness.

01:02:19.885 --> 01:02:21.017
Wilderness?

01:02:21.019 --> 01:02:22.088
But you...

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:25.992
are pathetic.

01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:28.327
You're a dinosaur,

01:02:28.526 --> 01:02:30.530
and you're about to be extinct.

01:02:32.497 --> 01:02:35.268
Ooh, you're all so scary.

01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:38.437
Oh, so empowered.

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:42.272
Some kind of lesbian Laundromat,

01:02:42.274 --> 01:02:45.077
where you all
hang out the men to dry.

01:02:46.077 --> 01:02:48.814
I am calling a cab.

01:02:49.013 --> 01:02:50.849
Thank you. Out.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.922
Ladies.

01:02:57.522 --> 01:02:59.189
Andres.

01:03:05.296 --> 01:03:08.834
Andres,
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

01:03:10.568 --> 01:03:12.435
Your friend from Caracas?

01:03:12.437 --> 01:03:17.443

Hey, brother.

01:04:31.749 --> 01:04:33.652
- Hello, my friend.
- How are you doing?

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:39.258
Uh, how many boxes of these
can I take on the airplane?

01:04:39.557 --> 01:04:41.758
- Where to?
- Miami.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.259
- Two boxes.
- Oh.

01:04:44.261 --> 01:04:46.395
You know, I can't get these
right in Miami.

01:04:46.397 --> 01:04:48.031
- Give me four?
- I said two.

01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:50.536
- No, four boxes.
- I said two.

01:04:51.102 --> 01:04:53.669
Come on, Gorbachov,
just give me four boxes, okay?

01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:55.604
I can't...
I can't get those there.

01:04:55.606 --> 01:04:57.207
You're calling me
Gorbachov?

01:04:57.209 --> 01:04:59.676
- Hmm.
- Are you all right?

01:04:59.678 --> 01:05:01.013
Hmm...

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:03.683
50/50, brother.

01:05:05.283 --> 01:05:07.687
You know, I met somebody
very special last night.

01:05:08.687 --> 01:05:10.022
What happened?

01:05:10.622 --> 01:05:14.093
Oh, Jesus.
I almost made the biggest,

01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:18.030
biggest fucking mistake
in my whole life.

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.533
What did you do?

01:05:23.568 --> 01:05:24.970
I didn't do anything.

01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:28.441
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.808
What can I say? I ain't got
the answers to that.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.145
Because it's you.

01:05:34.146 --> 01:05:35.745
I give you four boxes.

01:05:39.283 --> 01:05:41.417
- How's the family?
- It's all right.

01:05:41.419 --> 01:05:42.488
Yeah?

01:05:44.488 --> 01:05:46.057
It's 120.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.394
Here's for the cigarettes and...

01:05:50.162 --> 01:05:53.732
And take your wife out
to dinner on me tomorrow night.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.068
What the fuck?

01:05:57.068 --> 01:05:59.334
That's the biggest tip
I ever got in my life.

01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:01.206
Hmm. Yeah. Good for you.

01:06:03.175 --> 01:06:04.142
Take care, brother.

01:06:05.343 --> 01:06:06.645
Are you gonna come back?

01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:11.548
- Take care, James.
- Adios, amigo.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.252
Have a safe flight.

01:06:25.729 --> 01:06:27.430
Life is a bitch, right?

01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:31.236
Very sorry,
not much English.

01:06:31.502 --> 01:06:33.602
It's all-you-can-drink here.

01:06:33.604 --> 01:06:35.571
I not want for drinking,
all right?

01:06:35.573 --> 01:06:37.242
I just want to...

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:39.375
I... I need nice girl.

01:06:39.377 --> 01:06:41.243
- Quickly...
- Stop, stop, stop,

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:43.613
- stop, stop, stop, stop.
- What's the problem?

01:06:43.615 --> 01:06:46.551
- Here's my police ID.
- Hey, you know the game.

01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:50.488
Come on, Frosch,
about 40 on his heavy side.

01:06:50.722 --> 01:06:52.792
And if... if he's here?

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.594
Then you bring him out home.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.463
Oh, just like that?

01:06:59.131 --> 01:07:00.266
Just like that.

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:04.636
- Or aren't we friends anymore?
- Uh...

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:13.578
Ladies,
where did the Arab guy go?

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:15.247
What Arab?

01:07:15.613 --> 01:07:18.680
Laila, you don't fuck with me.

01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:27.760
You better leave.

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:29.528
I can't.

01:07:32.597 --> 01:07:34.133
Okay. What's going on?

01:07:35.167 --> 01:07:36.702
No, no sex please.

01:07:38.836 --> 01:07:40.370
What is?

01:07:40.372 --> 01:07:42.475
It's, uh... my last night

01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:45.577
and I... I just need, um...

01:07:46.278 --> 01:07:47.709
what the name?

01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:50.180
- Chips. You need the chips.
- Huh?

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:53.582
Three chips, 50 euro.
One chip, 20 minutes max.

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:55.218
- Yeah.
- You understand?

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.953
No, but no sex.

01:07:56.955 --> 01:07:58.354
Same.

01:07:58.356 --> 01:08:00.359
Police are
looking for an Arab.

01:08:06.698 --> 01:08:08.531
Somebody with you?

01:08:08.533 --> 01:08:10.433
- No.
- No?

01:08:10.435 --> 01:08:11.570
B... but...

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.772
No b... but.

01:08:14.506 --> 01:08:16.207
I stink, I need to shower.

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.216
You can come out.

01:08:27.218 --> 01:08:28.587
Don't worry. No sex.

01:08:52.843 --> 01:08:54.345
What you're hiding from?

01:08:58.381 --> 01:08:59.385
No trust?

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:03.955
Okay.

01:09:05.823 --> 01:09:07.259
What's your budget then?

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:10.962
Your budget.

01:09:27.611 --> 01:09:29.814
Come on. He must be in there.

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:31.813
Someone saw him enter the club.

01:09:31.814 --> 01:09:32.952
He is not.

01:09:34.285 --> 01:09:36.520
Do you want me
to get a search warrant?

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.821
What's going on, Tony? Huh?

01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:41.057
Three kids threw some
incendiary materials

01:09:41.059 --> 01:09:42.591
into the asylum.

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:43.962
Two refugees went after them.

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:47.299
They obviously caught
one of the kids, 15 years old.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:48.834
Oh.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.867
And then?

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:52.004
He's still alive.

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:54.306
It wouldn't be good
if we found him here.

01:09:58.376 --> 01:10:01.547
Shh. Shh.

01:10:10.422 --> 01:10:11.589
Where are you from?

01:10:12.856 --> 01:10:14.292
Don't exist no more.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.361
It still has a name.

01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:18.631
Home.

01:10:24.069 --> 01:10:26.571
- You are legal here?
- Very legal.

01:10:26.937 --> 01:10:28.373
I'm married.

01:10:29.039 --> 01:10:30.475
Lucky he.

01:10:31.342 --> 01:10:32.477
To a German.

01:10:32.744 --> 01:10:33.812
Girl.

01:10:34.512 --> 01:10:36.282
Ah, nobody's perfect.

01:10:43.754 --> 01:10:45.423
I stabbed a boy.

01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:47.860
A boy,

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:49.927
with my knife.

01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:53.766
Why?

01:10:53.998 --> 01:10:56.366
He tried to put fire
on our home.

01:10:57.702 --> 01:10:58.904
It was self-defense.

01:11:02.539 --> 01:11:04.510
Okay. Take him out.

01:11:06.778 --> 01:11:09.080
Remember, not too long ago?

01:11:10.647 --> 01:11:13.319
Before this prick
bought your club,

01:11:13.952 --> 01:11:16.088
people in trouble
were helped here.

01:11:16.788 --> 01:11:20.025
Sometimes people in trouble
are giving us trouble.

01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:46.652
If they find him,
you'll have problems.

01:11:47.552 --> 01:11:48.654
Not you?

01:11:52.589 --> 01:11:54.693
The kid just died
in the hospital.

01:12:00.198 --> 01:12:01.867
What if he's not guilty?

01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:04.035
You're on the wrong side,
Frosch.

01:12:04.802 --> 01:12:05.937
Always.

01:12:06.971 --> 01:12:09.475
I know because...

01:12:10.607 --> 01:12:12.543
my father didn't love me.

01:12:13.977 --> 01:12:16.614
And that makes me
f... f... furious.

01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:20.849
I'm so sorry.

01:13:11.168 --> 01:13:12.602
What?

01:13:12.604 --> 01:13:13.768
What time?

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:15.706
What? I don't know. About 7:00.

01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:19.774
Don't worry. You're safe here.

01:13:19.776 --> 01:13:21.210
What?

01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:23.645
- My wife, my kids.
- What?

01:13:23.647 --> 01:13:26.048
- What are you talking about?
- It's too late, it's too late.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:27.582
No, you can't go.

01:13:27.584 --> 01:13:28.917
- Don't run away.
- No, no, no, no.

01:13:28.919 --> 01:13:30.886
If you run away,
they think you're guilty.

01:13:30.888 --> 01:13:31.923
I am guilty.

01:13:36.793 --> 01:13:37.796
Thank you.

01:15:20.731 --> 01:15:21.766
Sir.

01:15:58.936 --> 01:16:00.672
- Cheers.
- Hey guys.

01:16:01.271 --> 01:16:02.774
This is Sara.

01:16:03.341 --> 01:16:04.943
Give her a drink, okay?

01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:08.380
- Sara, I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

01:16:09.079 --> 01:16:10.214
Don't worry.

01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:15.720
Thanks.

01:19:47.163 --> 01:19:48.165
Are you okay?

01:19:49.232 --> 01:19:51.136
Yes, I'm okay. Thank you.

01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:06.318
Sorry.

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:09.354
I just had a fight
with my boyfriend.

01:20:10.186 --> 01:20:11.388
And I'm okay. Thanks.

01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:15.926
Well...

01:20:16.994 --> 01:20:18.597
I think those kind
of things happen.

01:20:26.503 --> 01:20:29.039
My father was supposed
to pick me up at 8:00.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:31.910
And what time is it?

01:20:32.443 --> 01:20:33.611
9:00.

01:20:35.145 --> 01:20:37.114
Well, you know what?

01:20:38.382 --> 01:20:40.085
That kind of things happen.

01:20:55.699 --> 01:20:57.101
Do you want a beer?

01:20:57.735 --> 01:20:58.970
Yeah.

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:08.312
Just what I needed.

01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:22.226
No.

01:21:22.525 --> 01:21:23.694
Why not?

01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:25.529
You're a minor.

01:21:26.297 --> 01:21:28.033
Yes, But I'm 16.

01:21:28.999 --> 01:21:30.200
Exactly.

01:21:31.202 --> 01:21:32.671
So, you're not permitted.

01:21:33.637 --> 01:21:37.542
Yeah. This is Germany here.
You're allowed to drink at 16.

01:21:38.008 --> 01:21:40.142
- You're allowed to drink?
- Yeah.

01:21:40.144 --> 01:21:41.512
- Look.
- No way.

01:21:42.445 --> 01:21:43.547
Really?

01:21:44.015 --> 01:21:45.150
16.

01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:48.586
Wow.

01:21:52.022 --> 01:21:53.290
Hah! You fucker!

01:21:53.623 --> 01:21:55.159
It's your birthday.

01:21:56.127 --> 01:21:57.626
Oh, no, come on.

01:21:57.628 --> 01:21:59.030
Better give you a hug.

01:22:01.598 --> 01:22:03.534
Yeah, congratulations.

01:22:04.034 --> 01:22:05.169
Thank you.

01:22:13.511 --> 01:22:14.678
What was his name?

01:22:15.546 --> 01:22:16.577
What?

01:22:16.579 --> 01:22:18.048
Your boyfriend.

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:21.218
Thomas.

01:22:23.287 --> 01:22:24.321
German?

01:22:25.221 --> 01:22:26.290
Yeah.

01:22:32.762 --> 01:22:34.332
You have girlfriends?

01:22:35.231 --> 01:22:36.266
What?

01:22:36.633 --> 01:22:38.269
Before you have a boyfriend?

01:22:39.503 --> 01:22:40.672
I had a few.

01:22:44.307 --> 01:22:45.510
Did you liked it?

01:22:46.276 --> 01:22:47.345
Not really.

01:22:49.212 --> 01:22:50.681
I prefer to kiss boys.

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:57.521
And how you knew?

01:22:59.155 --> 01:23:00.624
I don't know.
Just happens.

01:23:07.297 --> 01:23:09.767
I don't know if I prefer to kiss
men or women.

01:23:11.502 --> 01:23:14.372
Like, you just,
just have to try both.

01:23:15.239 --> 01:23:16.374
I guess...

01:23:17.173 --> 01:23:18.243
but how?

01:23:19.142 --> 01:23:20.811
Like, just go and ask them.

01:23:21.512 --> 01:23:22.580
Simple.

01:23:31.321 --> 01:23:33.158
Will you please kiss me?

01:23:34.525 --> 01:23:35.393
Excuse me?

01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:38.797
I'm asking you,
could you please kiss me?

01:23:39.529 --> 01:23:42.099
I wanna know what it feels
to kiss a man.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.536
Hmm.

01:23:47.137 --> 01:23:49.438
You know what, baby?
Technically, right now,

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.842
you're in front of a woman.

01:23:51.842 --> 01:23:53.445
So, it's not gonna work.

01:23:53.776 --> 01:23:55.212
Yeah, but...

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.816
you are a man.

01:24:01.318 --> 01:24:03.555
It's a little more complicated
than that.

01:24:08.825 --> 01:24:10.261
As a birthday gift.

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:16.534
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?

01:24:18.269 --> 01:24:20.838
I've been drinking,
smoking all night.

01:24:21.372 --> 01:24:22.673
You're just gonna hate it.

01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:39.524
Okay. Just one.

01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:04.649
And?

01:25:10.887 --> 01:25:12.156
I don't know.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.763
But I will consider it
as a birthday present.

01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:22.600
Fair enough.

01:25:24.501 --> 01:25:25.537
Yeah.

01:25:27.738 --> 01:25:28.906
I think I gotta go.

01:25:30.373 --> 01:25:31.441
Yeah.

01:25:34.645 --> 01:25:37.515
Remember,
those kind of things happen.

01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.975
Excuse me.

01:26:07.977 --> 01:26:10.280
Did you see a girl
with, uh, brown hair?

01:26:10.681 --> 01:26:11.950
Is that coffee?

01:26:12.949 --> 01:26:13.952
Uh, yeah.

01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:15.886
It's yours.

01:26:17.288 --> 01:26:18.990
By the way, he dies in the end.

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.443
It's a strange place, isn't it?

01:26:42.846 --> 01:26:43.881
Yeah.

01:26:58.995 --> 01:27:00.397
No, thanks.

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:50.781
<i>So,
I am the last man alive.</i>

01:27:51.848 --> 01:27:54.582
<i>The only one to see
how it truly ends.</i>

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.333
Oh, boy.

01:28:08.632 --> 01:28:09.798
Hey, Jeremy.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.968
<i>Burke Linz,
my favorite client.</i>

01:28:12.403 --> 01:28:14.502
- <i>Still in Berlin?</i>
- I am.

01:28:14.504 --> 01:28:15.571
How did it go?

01:28:15.573 --> 01:28:17.671
<i>Yeah!
Test went well last night.</i>

01:28:17.673 --> 01:28:19.944
<i>And they are talking sequel.</i>

01:28:20.511 --> 01:28:23.411
Jeez. I mean, uh, it's a movie
about the end of the world.

01:28:23.413 --> 01:28:25.413
I think I killed
about seventy billion people.

01:28:25.415 --> 01:28:26.915
How do you make
a sequel to that?

01:28:26.917 --> 01:28:28.916
<i>How?
What do you mean how?</i>

01:28:28.918 --> 01:28:30.652
<i>You know,
you make the same movie, uh,</i>

01:28:30.654 --> 01:28:31.689
<i>a little different.</i>

01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:33.955
Yeah... no. Jeremy, listen,
I don't... I don't...

01:28:33.957 --> 01:28:36.026
<i>You want that
superhero money, right?</i>

01:28:37.961 --> 01:28:40.629
Are... are they freaking out
that I'm not there?

01:28:40.631 --> 01:28:42.964
<i>Maybe a little.
But who cares?</i>

01:28:42.966 --> 01:28:45.434
<i>You've spent the last two years
of your life on this movie.</i>

01:28:45.436 --> 01:28:46.968
<i>Unless they want you
to run the projector,</i>

01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:48.539
- <i>what else can you do?</i>
- Well...

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:51.742
I'm exhausted.
That's for sure.

01:28:52.575 --> 01:28:54.009
I might be losing it.

01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:56.781
<i>Burke, go out.
See people.</i>

01:28:57.047 --> 01:28:58.683
<i>Do whatever you do in Berlin.</i>

01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:00.852
<i>I gotta go.</i>

01:29:01.118 --> 01:29:02.783
<i>Think superhero money.</i>

01:29:02.785 --> 01:29:04.118
<i>All right.
I love you, mate.</i>

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.620
You love me?

01:29:05.622 --> 01:29:06.891
Thank you, Jeremy.

01:29:14.597 --> 01:29:18.435

Oh, uh,

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.251

Isn't it, Lucinda?

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:25.128
I'm Burke.

01:31:27.196 --> 01:31:28.266
Katarina.

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.733
That, uh, you really create
a whole universe.

01:31:32.735 --> 01:31:35.170
It's... it's... it's very
interesting to watch.

01:31:35.172 --> 01:31:36.804
It's... yeah.

01:31:36.806 --> 01:31:37.874
Thank you.

01:31:39.176 --> 01:31:40.645
Um...

01:31:41.011 --> 01:31:43.147
got a couple of minutes
till my next show.

01:31:43.713 --> 01:31:44.848
If you wanna sit.

01:31:47.883 --> 01:31:49.587
Yeah. I...

01:31:49.986 --> 01:31:51.087
why not?

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:55.389
You're visiting?

01:31:55.391 --> 01:31:56.793
I am. Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:56.994 --> 01:31:58.696
You can tell?

01:31:59.629 --> 01:32:05.069
Uh, this isn't really a place
where many locals come.

01:32:05.968 --> 01:32:07.704
Mostly tourists.

01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:10.904
Well, I mean, I...
I have to say,

01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:13.308
it's really, really beautiful.

01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:15.178
You picked a great spot.

01:32:15.745 --> 01:32:17.077
Where are you from?

01:32:17.079 --> 01:32:18.181
I'm from New York.

01:32:18.882 --> 01:32:20.084
Where... where are you from?

01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:22.185
All over, really.

01:32:22.886 --> 01:32:24.789
I was spending a lot of time
in Amsterdam.

01:32:25.221 --> 01:32:26.623
Bad marriage...

01:32:26.989 --> 01:32:28.288
parents died.

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:32.329
Uh, came to Berlin
for a little bit of a rebirth.

01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:36.166
Berlin is a city that knows
a thing or two about a rebirth.

01:32:40.169 --> 01:32:42.336
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:42.338 --> 01:32:44.304
My father actually grew up here.

01:32:44.306 --> 01:32:46.840
He made shoes, uh,
he... he had a...

01:32:46.842 --> 01:32:48.209
a little shop not far from here.

01:32:48.211 --> 01:32:50.812
He made this really beautiful
handmade shoes.

01:32:50.814 --> 01:32:52.346
And they were the kind that,
you know,

01:32:52.348 --> 01:32:55.116
if you took good care of them,
they'd last your whole lifetime.

01:32:55.118 --> 01:32:57.919
And, uh...
it's just not a philosophy

01:32:57.921 --> 01:33:00.087
that you see much these days,
you know?

01:33:00.089 --> 01:33:02.159
But that was him. Yeah.

01:33:02.726 --> 01:33:03.961
He's a real artist.

01:33:07.029 --> 01:33:08.331
How long have you been...

01:33:09.098 --> 01:33:11.769
doing the...
the puppet shows and...

01:33:11.967 --> 01:33:13.336
I like to call it theater.

01:33:13.904 --> 01:33:15.239
Theater, excuse me.

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:17.975
A few years.

01:33:19.943 --> 01:33:21.475
And the ostrich...

01:33:21.477 --> 01:33:23.178
It was amazing
watching the kids.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.217
How they... they really seem
to love her. They...

01:33:26.449 --> 01:33:28.183
Yeah. She has many shows,

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:29.384
- you know?
- Yeah.

01:33:29.386 --> 01:33:31.254
<i>Lucinda and the High Seas.</i>

01:33:31.488 --> 01:33:33.721
<i>Lucinda Meets the Ostrich King.</i>

01:33:33.723 --> 01:33:36.256
My favorite,
<i>Lucinda on Irish Holiday,</i>

01:33:36.258 --> 01:33:37.727
and now...

01:33:38.095 --> 01:33:39.430
<i>Lucinda in Berlin.</i>

01:33:41.364 --> 01:33:43.264
Lucinda is secretly in love
with the giraffe,

01:33:43.266 --> 01:33:44.368
called Roman De Cleff.

01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:46.001
Huh.

01:33:46.003 --> 01:33:48.402
So how do you know
so much about the characters?

01:33:48.404 --> 01:33:51.072
I mean, do you just make it
all up or where do you...

01:33:51.074 --> 01:33:54.278
Uh, you take... you take
a journey with them.

01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:55.912
It takes time.

01:33:57.012 --> 01:33:59.848
I just try to give them
some humanity and, uh...

01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:02.349
integrity, uh...

01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:03.988
because if I don't, who will?

01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:05.853
And the kids?

01:34:05.855 --> 01:34:07.755
Do you feel that they know
the difference?

01:34:07.757 --> 01:34:11.792
Oh. Kids are the most open,

01:34:11.794 --> 01:34:14.362
honest audience
that you can find.

01:34:14.364 --> 01:34:15.433
Yeah.

01:34:16.967 --> 01:34:19.067
- Adults however...
- Oh. Hey, I'm...

01:34:19.069 --> 01:34:21.305
yeah, don't even get me started
on adults.

01:34:23.205 --> 01:34:25.342
With kids,
you're showing them the world.

01:34:27.077 --> 01:34:29.213
And, and you're fulfilled?

01:34:29.445 --> 01:34:30.881
Hello!

01:34:32.015 --> 01:34:33.084
Hi.

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.453
Uh, what do you mean?

01:34:35.886 --> 01:34:39.190
You know, with, you know,
your art and...

01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:40.925
your life?

01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:42.860
Yeah.

01:34:43.994 --> 01:34:47.364
Uh, look, there is nothing
more that I need or want.

01:34:50.266 --> 01:34:51.901
I hope you can say the same.

01:34:55.372 --> 01:34:56.406
Yeah.

01:34:58.941 --> 01:35:00.877
Well, I should get back
to my show.

01:35:02.479 --> 01:35:04.312
Yeah. Excuse me, I don't...

01:35:04.314 --> 01:35:06.214
looks like you already got
a customer here.

01:35:06.216 --> 01:35:08.185
Hey, you're gonna love the show.

01:35:12.422 --> 01:35:14.923
See, I don't speak
German either.

01:35:16.126 --> 01:35:17.427
Have a great time.

01:35:19.829 --> 01:35:22.832
Not many people wanna
talk to me about my puppets.

01:35:24.133 --> 01:35:27.471
It's been the best, best
part of my trip so far, really.

01:35:28.939 --> 01:35:31.142
I... I needed it, so, thanks.

01:35:31.975 --> 01:35:33.177
See you later.

01:35:38.047 --> 01:35:40.514
Would it be possible
to talk some more?

01:35:40.516 --> 01:35:42.884
Would that be... I mean, I could
take you and Lucinda

01:35:42.886 --> 01:35:43.988
to dinner or something.

01:35:44.855 --> 01:35:46.123
She doesn't eat much.

01:35:47.891 --> 01:35:49.560
Well, hey, that's...
that's more for us.

01:35:51.293 --> 01:35:54.261
Well, you know, it was nice...
it was nice just to get

01:35:54.263 --> 01:35:56.464
the chance to talk you
and to see the show.

01:35:56.466 --> 01:35:57.267
And, uh...

01:35:58.568 --> 01:36:00.937
I don't know,
it really just, uh...

01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:05.810
Thank you.

01:36:06.376 --> 01:36:08.242
Sometimes
I'm at the corner cafe

01:36:08.244 --> 01:36:09.979
at Rosenthaler Platz.

01:36:13.415 --> 01:36:15.820
Rosenthaler Platz.

01:36:17.486 --> 01:36:18.556
Great.

01:36:22.559 --> 01:36:24.895
Great show,
go, go, check it out.

01:36:26.462 --> 01:36:28.598
<i>So, this is how
it all begins again.</i>

01:36:29.298 --> 01:36:32.168
<i>The feeling of fullness,
of humanity.</i>

01:36:32.668 --> 01:36:34.337
<i>That love is possible.</i>

01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:36.906
<i>That everything is possible.</i>

01:36:38.341 --> 01:36:40.508
<i>At first, there
were only ashes.</i>

01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:43.210
<i>And now,
when you least expected it,</i>

01:36:43.212 --> 01:36:45.415
<i>you are, once more...</i>

01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:47.283
<i>in the Garden of Eden.</i>

01:37:40.971 --> 01:37:41.939
Fuck!

01:39:43.126 --> 01:39:44.628
House of World Cultures.

01:39:45.829 --> 01:39:47.795
Ha!

01:39:47.797 --> 01:39:49.529
No one here calls it like that.

01:39:49.531 --> 01:39:52.569
We call it the Pregnant Oyster
or Jimmy Carter's smile.

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:55.272
Are you American?

01:39:56.138 --> 01:39:58.342
- What?
- Are you American?

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.444
Yeah, sure.

01:40:01.377 --> 01:40:03.643
No, no, no.
A lot of police?

01:40:03.645 --> 01:40:05.679
Have you been to Turkey?
I mean, there...

01:40:05.681 --> 01:40:08.381
You know, in Istanbul
there is police at every corner,

01:40:08.383 --> 01:40:10.318
and they still
can't guarantee safety.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.219
I guess under pretext
of fighting the terror,

01:40:12.221 --> 01:40:13.787
they just want to control
the opposition.

01:40:13.789 --> 01:40:15.389
Have you followed
the politics there?

01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:16.657
Isn't that unbelievable?

01:40:16.659 --> 01:40:18.526
- It's...
- Sorry.

01:40:18.528 --> 01:40:20.396
Do you really need
to keep talking? I mean...

01:40:20.663 --> 01:40:23.296
it would be great
if you just not do that.

01:40:23.298 --> 01:40:25.765
Sorry.
Just a habit, you know?

01:40:25.767 --> 01:40:28.305
I love to chat
with my customers.

01:40:28.538 --> 01:40:31.639
Actually, I'm, I'm a reporter,
kind of, you know,

01:40:31.641 --> 01:40:34.742
neighborhood stuff,
gentrification, migrants.

01:40:34.744 --> 01:40:36.413
The big picture, little things.

01:40:37.547 --> 01:40:39.613
No big magazine would hire me,

01:40:39.615 --> 01:40:41.816
unless I would come up
with a story, you know,

01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:43.486
a big story like...

01:40:44.287 --> 01:40:46.254
opening restaurant in Neukoelln.

01:40:46.256 --> 01:40:47.857
You know what I mean?

01:40:48.857 --> 01:40:51.294
I'm Yasil, by the way.
What's your name?

01:40:54.763 --> 01:40:56.732
- Greg.
- Nice to meet you, Greg.

01:40:58.568 --> 01:40:59.837
Tough day, huh?

01:41:00.436 --> 01:41:01.472
I tell you.

01:41:02.573 --> 01:41:05.372
You remind me somehow
of my first boyfriend.

01:41:05.374 --> 01:41:06.676
He was also a bit nerdy.

01:41:09.479 --> 01:41:11.912
And you remind me
of my first girlfriend.

01:41:11.914 --> 01:41:13.714
She could never keep
her mouth shut.

01:41:17.387 --> 01:41:19.687
- You like philosophy?
- Hmm?

01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:21.557
I studied it at university.

01:41:26.395 --> 01:41:27.263
Adorno!

01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:30.734
No, no, no.
Uh, I memorized that.

01:41:32.502 --> 01:41:34.171
Are you working in philosophy?

01:41:34.637 --> 01:41:38.342
No. Uh, I became an IT engineer.

01:41:39.809 --> 01:41:41.744
It was easier
to cash in on that.

01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:45.214
But philosophy is something
I'm still really into.

01:41:46.548 --> 01:41:47.717
But this morning...

01:41:52.221 --> 01:41:53.489
this morning...

01:41:57.694 --> 01:41:59.760
Do you think it's hard
not to have a home?

01:41:59.762 --> 01:42:01.228
What do you mean?

01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:04.901
Uh, you're Turkish
living in Germany.

01:42:07.637 --> 01:42:09.437
Yeah, but I have a home.

01:42:09.439 --> 01:42:12.406
I mean, I'm German,
a bit Turkish,

01:42:12.408 --> 01:42:13.707
but I'm German.

01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:15.945
Uh, I mean if one, um...

01:42:16.546 --> 01:42:19.348
suddenly had no home at all?

01:42:20.283 --> 01:42:22.916
Because they finally decided
to be true to themselves.

01:42:22.918 --> 01:42:25.622
That would be a high price
and a real pity.

01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:28.792
Being true to yourself
should always be rewarded.

01:42:30.827 --> 01:42:32.930
That only happens
in fairy tales, right?

01:42:33.829 --> 01:42:36.632
Yes, it does, but sometimes,
not only there.

01:42:37.934 --> 01:42:39.867
And we live for these moments?

01:42:39.869 --> 01:42:41.939
Yes. That's what we live for.

01:43:02.792 --> 01:43:05.792
- Go, go, go, go.
- What? What?

01:43:05.794 --> 01:43:07.797
What was that?

01:43:10.967 --> 01:43:13.567
Oh. They're catch...
they're catching up.

01:43:30.052 --> 01:43:32.388
Sorry!

01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:37.026
Hey!

01:43:51.473 --> 01:43:52.676
Are they gone?

01:43:53.543 --> 01:43:55.445
I don't know,
I don't know.

01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:02.953
Take me to the embassy district.

01:44:03.586 --> 01:44:05.489
What? But we have to call
the police!

01:44:05.754 --> 01:44:07.087
No.

01:44:07.089 --> 01:44:08.458
Please...

01:44:08.857 --> 01:44:10.494
we don't have much time.

01:44:31.913 --> 01:44:33.082
Yasil...

01:44:34.516 --> 01:44:35.918
you shouldn't give up
on your dream...

01:44:36.886 --> 01:44:38.055
you know?

01:44:43.525 --> 01:44:44.727
Thank you.

01:44:46.995 --> 01:44:48.364
You're a good driver.

01:46:15.016 --> 01:46:16.153
Okay.

01:46:44.913 --> 01:46:47.050
<i>Everybody!</i>

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.189
Everybody!

01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:55.191
Hey!

01:47:11.073 --> 01:47:13.640
Good morning, folks!

01:47:17.312 --> 01:47:19.149
- Yeah!
- So, who's next?

01:47:21.551 --> 01:47:22.950
<i>Who wants to sing a song?</i>

01:47:22.952 --> 01:47:23.885
<i>Who, who, who?</i>

01:47:23.887 --> 01:47:26.286
- Me!
- <i>Oh, red leather jacket?</i>

01:47:26.288 --> 01:47:27.955
- Uh-hmm.
- <i>Yes, red leather jacket</i>

01:47:27.957 --> 01:47:29.322
<i>everybody.</i>

01:47:32.962 --> 01:47:34.327
- Can I give you this?
- Yes.

01:47:34.329 --> 01:47:36.596
- What's this for?
- It's the second track.

01:47:36.598 --> 01:47:38.698
You're not... you're not
being high maintenance

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:39.800
- are you?
- No.

01:47:39.802 --> 01:47:40.834
What's your name?

01:47:40.836 --> 01:47:42.036
Sara.

01:47:42.038 --> 01:47:43.970
Sara. Say hi to Sara, everybody.

01:47:46.242 --> 01:47:48.608
- So where are you from?
- Tel Aviv.

01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:50.113
From Tenerife, everybody.

01:47:50.879 --> 01:47:52.645
Sara's from Tenerife.

01:47:52.647 --> 01:47:54.982
- Tel Aviv.
- Tel Aviv. Sorry, its Tel Aviv.

01:47:54.984 --> 01:47:56.783
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:47:56.785 --> 01:47:58.652
- You found it?
- Party sound, right?

01:47:58.654 --> 01:47:59.853
Yes.

01:47:59.855 --> 01:48:00.857
Thank you.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:06.962
Hi.

01:48:07.663 --> 01:48:08.932
My name is Sara.

01:48:10.098 --> 01:48:11.932
I've been here barely 48 hours,

01:48:11.934 --> 01:48:14.734
and I already feel like
I'm a part of Berlin, you know?

01:48:14.736 --> 01:48:15.868
But sometimes...

01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:17.740
you feel alone
and you feel like...

01:48:18.207 --> 01:48:20.644
you're not heard
and you're not seen.

01:48:21.744 --> 01:48:23.978
But when that happens,
just turn around

01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:26.850
<i>because there might be someone
actually listening.</i>

01:48:28.618 --> 01:48:30.587
In my case, it was an angel,

01:48:31.287 --> 01:48:33.022
<i>with wings and everything.</i>

01:48:34.155 --> 01:48:35.891
I guess, I just got lucky.

01:48:38.628 --> 01:48:41.231
So, this song is for all
the angels out there.

01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:43.934
<i>With or without wings.</i>

01:48:46.302 --> 01:48:49.103
