WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.307 --> 00:10.844
We're back and things
are about to get fucking naughty.

00:12.245 --> 00:15.815
It's going to be bigger...
and better than ever before.

00:15.882 --> 00:16.883
(all cheer)

00:16.950 --> 00:18.451
(cheering)

00:18.518 --> 00:20.320
More kissing...

00:20.387 --> 00:22.255
Getting fucked up.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.691
Tears...
(sobbing)

00:24.758 --> 00:26.493
...arguing.
(shouting)

00:27.961 --> 00:29.429
(screams)

00:30.230 --> 00:32.131
Bring... it... on.

00:33.666 --> 00:37.103
Nothing is ever innocent
with Gary fucking Beadle.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.508
I fucking hate ya!
Psycho Charlotte is back.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.384
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.

00:51.451 --> 00:55.855
We take over the boys' room and make
it the official Boyfriend Clubhouse.

00:56.656 --> 00:57.624
(moans)

00:59.359 --> 01:01.361
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.763
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.266
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.134
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.403
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.338
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.407
I'm colourful
and full of mischief.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.209
I'm fit, flirty with double Fs.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.778
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:18.845 --> 01:21.281
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:39.799 --> 01:42.001
Last night we took over
the boys' room

01:42.068 --> 01:45.839
and made it the official
Boyfriend Club. Winning.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.978
It's weird waking up in a room
full of couples, naked.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.346
Like a swingers' party.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.116
Yous had sex?

01:57.183 --> 02:00.520
Char's let 'em back in
the Boyfriend Club. Did yous?

02:00.587 --> 02:02.055
Yeah.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.690
Oh, my God, you were.

02:04.991 --> 02:07.427
Oh, my God, that's so embarrassing.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.763
This is awkward.
They all heard me and Gary at it.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.702
Then again, it's not the first time,
and it definitely won't be the last.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.504
Did anything happen with yous?

02:17.570 --> 02:18.771
No. (laughs)
No.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.140
Not a thing?
It's not all about sex.

02:21.207 --> 02:24.878
Me and Kyle have been getting along
great. I don't wanna ruin that.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.681
(laughs)
Right, let's not talk about that.

02:28.748 --> 02:32.452
I'm not gonna lie, I'm horny.
I've got the girl I fancy in bed.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.988
The fact it's Holly,
it's worth the wait.

02:42.228 --> 02:46.566
I've woken up alone. I left the club
last night because I felt alone,

02:46.633 --> 02:50.537
and that lot are shacked up in some
sort of Boyfriend Club bonanza.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.605
Are you OK today?
Yeah, are yous?

02:52.672 --> 02:53.773
Yeah.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.112
Yeah.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.447
Yeah.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.886
It's nice of the girls to come and
check on us, and make sure I'm OK.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.222
15 hours later!

03:09.289 --> 03:11.691
Is the Boyfriend Club
ruining everything?

03:14.227 --> 03:19.132
Yeah, but it shouldn't be at the cost
of us being happy with you.

03:19.198 --> 03:23.136
We've been so obsessed with Boyfriend
Club that we have neglected Vicky.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.572
I forgot she was here.
I feel like such a dick.

03:25.638 --> 03:30.476
You've gotta accept that people are
going to do what they want first.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.612
Yeah.
And that's what yous are doing.

03:32.679 --> 03:36.783
The girls are thinking with their
vaginas. I hate Boyfriend Club.

03:36.849 --> 03:40.386
It's another reminder of the fact
that I'm not with me boyfriend.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.226
I've got a plan to make Vicky
part of the Boyfriend Club.

03:47.293 --> 03:50.029
I'm gonna ring her boyfriend
and invite him round,

03:50.096 --> 03:52.532
then we can all have
a massive orgy.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.667
We're all a bit worried about Vicky.

03:56.436 --> 04:00.840
She's just so down, James,
she just wants to see you so bad.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.712
He's keen. This means
Vicky's finally gonna be happy.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.889
Underwear shopping.
Brilliant, I was correct.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.625
I'd rather be anywhere else
in the world

04:19.692 --> 04:23.329
than looking at crotchless knickers
with this set of twats.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.265
But it beats lying in bed
feeling sorry for meself.

04:28.067 --> 04:32.505
We're off shopping, because we know
something that Vicky doesn't know,

04:32.572 --> 04:35.975
and what she doesn't know,
she needs underwear for.

04:37.543 --> 04:40.079
Erm, right, so what does James like,
Vicky?

04:41.748 --> 04:43.082
What colours?

04:43.983 --> 04:46.919
I honestly don't know why the lasses
brought us here.

04:46.986 --> 04:50.857
It's all about them and Boyfriend
Club. This is a fucking bag of piss.

04:50.923 --> 04:54.661
What are you doing?
It's a bit dusty down there.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.763
That is like Gary's, Charlotte.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.097
It's a bit bigger.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.300
Me and Charlotte can rely on
bonding over Gary's cock.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.705
It's so big, I struggle to think
how he gets by in life with it.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.341
I think Aaron would like
something like this.

05:08.408 --> 05:12.645
I wanna find something sexy to tease
Aaron, make him want us even more.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.149
I have found the perfect present
for Kyle.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.518
Wow.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.621
I think it'd be funny
if I get Kyle a fake vagina.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.589
I'm not ready to sleep with him yet.

05:23.656 --> 05:28.261
I want him to prove he really does
like me. So he's got a fake vagina.

05:28.327 --> 05:31.798
Oh, my God, it feels like one!
It feels amazing, doesn't it?

05:39.272 --> 05:42.909
To cheer Miss Mardy up, us lads
have cooked up a proper feast

05:42.975 --> 05:44.644
from a variety of packets.

05:47.747 --> 05:51.184
Blow me over with a feather.
They've tried to do something nice.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.853
They've made us a meal
and it's almost edible.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.254
(laughs)
What is it?

05:55.321 --> 06:00.093
I got Gary a cheeky present earlier.
He's gonna absolutely love it.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.067
Charlotte's given me passport photos
of herself.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.103
What am I gonna do with them?

06:10.169 --> 06:14.307
Gary, this is one for your bedside
table, one for your wallet,

06:14.373 --> 06:17.944
one for your car,
one for your pocket...

06:18.010 --> 06:20.012
(laughter)

06:20.079 --> 06:23.282
I am never, ever
getting rid of this girl.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.486
OK. Can't wait to see what Holly's
got us from the sex shop.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.795
Cheers, darling, that's wicked.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.631
(girls) What?!

06:39.465 --> 06:42.268
How is it? It's funny.
Well, this is awkward.

06:42.335 --> 06:47.039
I felt bad because I wasn't gonna
have sex. I thought it was a nice...

06:47.106 --> 06:50.743
Holly needs to realise I've done
all this effort, this hard work,

06:50.810 --> 06:52.445
to prove I like her.

06:52.512 --> 06:56.149
The way she repays us is giving us
a fake fanny. Fuck that.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.421
If I thought he'd get embarrassed
I would have never bought it.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.923
I just thought it was a joke.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.692
Kyle, you've upset Holly
a little bit,

07:06.759 --> 07:08.928
because she actually
got you a present.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.731
She didn't mean it in a bad way.

07:13.566 --> 07:17.970
Kyle takes it way too far and acts
like a giant plastic vagina,

07:18.037 --> 07:19.739
which is quite fitting.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.107
He's a fucking idiot.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.810
Don't get upset.

07:27.914 --> 07:32.218
I think that's disrespectful.
I actually am offended by it.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.454
I'm sorry for shouting,
but she needs to know how I felt.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.224
She made us look stupid
in front of everyone.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.965
I don't wanna be a cock tease.

07:46.032 --> 07:50.703
I do really like Kyle. I want him to
really like me before I do anything.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.777
Not that I wanted a great big
"We're sorry, Vicky" day,

07:57.844 --> 08:00.012
but if I did,

08:00.079 --> 08:03.282
this would be would be the worst
attempt in world history.

08:03.349 --> 08:07.420
It's ended up being about Poochie
Bear and his fucking plastic pussy!

08:07.486 --> 08:09.355
Boyfriend Club can suck me dick.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.291
(knock on door)

08:14.093 --> 08:16.362
(laughs) Hello.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.964
Vicky.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.266
(cheering)

08:20.333 --> 08:23.436
I can't believe it.
They managed to do something right.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.774
Thank fuck James turned up.
Vicky's absolutely buzzing.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.278
I thought at one point her face
would be stuck like a permanent N.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.748
(cheering)

08:35.815 --> 08:41.320
Vicky's gone from miserable bitch to
over the moon slag in 0.3 seconds.

08:43.322 --> 08:45.157
He's even brought us presents.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.894
FYI, Kyle,
this is how you accept a gift.

08:56.535 --> 09:00.206
Everyone needs a good night out.
Let's hit the toon and get fucked.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.244
Right, I'm off.
You're going?

09:05.311 --> 09:08.180
I don't see the need
to drag meself to Bijoux.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.883
We're gonna spend some
quality time together.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.886
Come on, then!

09:13.953 --> 09:18.124
If tonight is anything like last
night, it's gonna be boomtastic.

09:24.196 --> 09:28.067
It's Bijoux time for this bad boy.
Let's have a fucking mint night.

09:35.441 --> 09:39.145
I feel so sorry for Holly.
She looks really distant from Kyle.

09:39.211 --> 09:40.713
I have to sort this out.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.820
Holly needs to realise
I'm not pulling girls for her.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.957
That's the first time
I've ever done that in me life.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.733
I feel distant from Kyle.
I don't know what to do about it.

10:07.907 --> 10:12.945
I love Holly. There's no need for
her to be worrying about Kyle.

10:20.753 --> 10:23.422
This is mine and Kyle's
first argument here.

10:23.489 --> 10:27.026
Everybody goes through it.
I hope this isn't the first of many.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.465
So good to see you.

10:33.532 --> 10:37.103
It's so nice to just have that sense
of normality for a change.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.639
I'm just sitting in a nice bar
with me good-looking boyfriend,

10:40.706 --> 10:43.609
and I'm the one tashing on for once.
Buzzing.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.616
Tonight is the happiest I've been
in a long time.

10:50.683 --> 10:53.185
I really do love me Geordie family

10:53.252 --> 10:55.688
but I'm just not sure
I belong here any more.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.027
Hi. Nurse Marnie at your service.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.728
Willy has a pulse.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.930
I need a bit of time.
Eh? See yous.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.700
Where the fuck has that come from?

11:07.767 --> 11:11.237
Mad dog Marnie's escaped
out of her cage. (screams)

11:11.303 --> 11:13.739
Keep your distance,
or you'll get bitten.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.442
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:18.511 --> 11:18.711
.

11:21.247 --> 11:21.447
.

11:31.791 --> 11:36.162
Bijoux is banging tonight, and we're
gonna get absolutely trollied.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.599
Marnie's looking fit.
She's turning us on.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.469
I just wanna know
if she's got any knickers on.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.379
I don't want her
to feel uncomfortable,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.748
so there's no rush
to take things further.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.050
But fuck me,
a man's gonna explode soon.

12:01.854 --> 12:06.792
Boyfriend Club has turned us into
a bunch of giggling schoolgirls.

12:20.906 --> 12:25.010
I love how things are with me and
Aaron. I don't want it to change.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.346
If I sleep with him, they will.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.656
It's been a mint night. Everyone's
mortal, there's been no kick-offs.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.959
Time to get back to the house.

12:43.362 --> 12:44.697
Hiya.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.367
We get back to the house, and Vicky
and James look so loved up.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.838
For a change,
I'm just as pissed as everyone else.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.607
Talk about a romantic night.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.144
We're home,
but it doesn't feel like it.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.880
It feels like we've went
to the next bar,

13:00.946 --> 13:04.850
because everyone wants to stay up,
get drunk and dance like lunatics.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.426
Me and Aaron are getting on so well.

13:14.493 --> 13:18.964
Now is the perfect time to show him
that surprise I bought him earlier.

13:21.066 --> 13:25.604
Marnie has put on a sexy nurse's
outfit. Fuck me, she looks amazing.

13:25.671 --> 13:26.839
Right then.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.607
What, are you joking me?

13:28.674 --> 13:30.309
This is for you.

13:30.376 --> 13:34.914
Hi, Nurse Marnie at your service.
What might the problem be today?

13:37.149 --> 13:40.486
Oh, my God. Willy has a pulse!

13:40.553 --> 13:44.323
Marnie is winding me up so much.
She definitely knows how to tease.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.694
Nurse is getting naughty. (laughs)
Nurse's getting fucking aggressive.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.768
Marnie is absolutely mortal.
She's banged me head off the wall.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.504
I think that's the only bang
I'm getting tonight.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.006
I feel vulnerable.
I need to get changed.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.648
Everyone's getting on,
but I'll tell you one thing.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.117
I'm having that fucking shag pad
tonight.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.021
It's so nice having James here,

14:16.088 --> 14:19.325
but when he goes, will it just go
back to the way it was before

14:19.391 --> 14:21.093
when I feel alone?

14:31.070 --> 14:34.673
This girl is driving me crazy.
She's such a fucking tease.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.976
Aaron, I...

14:39.211 --> 14:43.015
Wow. Where the fuck has that come
from? Why has Marnie slapped us?

14:43.082 --> 14:45.517
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.957
If someone lifts me dress up, me
immediate reaction is to slap them,

14:52.024 --> 14:53.959
but I slapped Aaron too hard.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.863
You shouldn't lift me dress up.

14:57.930 --> 15:01.533
I didn't fucking lift that dress up.
I was wafting it as a joke.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.335
Marnie's overreacted.

15:05.437 --> 15:09.708
If I was Aaron, I'd put Marnie in
an envelope and fucking post her

15:09.775 --> 15:11.610
cos that kid is a nightmare.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.179
Whoa, hold on, Marnie. That hit me.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.348
Fucking sick.
Calm down.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.184
Look. Fuck, ah! Fuck!
You lifted me skirt up.

15:19.251 --> 15:23.322
You fucking hit us! What the fuck
you doing, you stupid bitch?

15:23.389 --> 15:26.225
Fuck this. I'm stuck in the middle.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.266
Warning, mad dog Marnie's
escaped out of her cage.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.069
Keep your distance or
you'll get fucking bitten.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.642
I'm calming you down, man.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.811
You just threw
a glass bottle at him.

15:45.878 --> 15:49.682
This is fucking typical. The one
night we all have a mint night,

15:49.748 --> 15:53.118
we get back and it's World War
fucking Three. Fuck off, Scott!

15:53.185 --> 15:55.788
Why don't you just calmly listen-
(shouting)

15:55.854 --> 15:57.189
(screams)

15:58.957 --> 16:00.659
Get away, get away, get away.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.162
Get away from the glass.
No, I'm going home.

16:03.228 --> 16:07.132
Marnie wants to leave. I hope she
fucking does and doesn't come back.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.971
Did Aaron just call me a slut?

16:13.038 --> 16:16.442
What did he just call us, a slut?
How fucking dare he?

16:16.508 --> 16:20.612
Did he just call me a slut? I
haven't even fucking slept with him.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.349
Shock. This is fucking drama,
kicking off again.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.385
Let go of us, Kyle!
Calm down. Let go.

16:27.353 --> 16:30.889
I thought tonight was gonna end
really well with me and Marnie.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.925
How fucking wrong could I have been?

16:32.991 --> 16:35.861
Let me deal with this.
You threw a glass bottle at us!

16:35.928 --> 16:39.965
I'm meant to be her best friend
but I've had it up to here with her.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.502
Just stay out of it, Kyle.
Go and see Holly.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.205
Can't believe how quickly things
can turn round.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.975
One minute everything's fine,
the next it's a complete disaster.

16:52.010 --> 16:56.815
I never thought it could get this
bad. I wanna go home. I want me mam.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.762
I'm glad she's left. Only thing she
knows how to do is fuck things up.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.530
It's time to go to bed.

17:13.031 --> 17:16.468
After all this drama, I want
a cuddle and I wanna go to bed.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.037
Charlotte's snoring,
so I'm gonna wake her up.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.906
But we know what happens
when Charlotte wakes up.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.076
(moans)

17:46.665 --> 17:49.067
What the fuck happened last night?

17:49.134 --> 17:50.969
I know I've done nothing wrong.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.806
Nothing to provoke that.
That slap was out of order.

17:53.872 --> 17:58.210
Again, Marnie ruined everything by
overreacting and attention seeking.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.679
She can stay
out of the house for good.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.850
All of a sudden, like,
she just went... radge.

18:04.917 --> 18:09.188
She threw a bottle. If Kyle didn't
stop it, it would've hit me face.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.490
Marnie always runs away
from problems,

18:11.557 --> 18:13.692
but she's gonna have to face up
to them.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.063
It's actually sort of fucking weird

18:18.130 --> 18:21.900
that there's no drama
between me and you.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.168
Shall we get married?

18:23.235 --> 18:25.838
What?
(laughs)

18:27.239 --> 18:30.943
All I'm saying is, it's nice that me
and you are having no drama.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.612
That does not mean
we're gonna get married.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.748
Like, you just proposed to us.
(laughs)

18:36.815 --> 18:41.386
I thought that's what you meant
if we were getting on well. (laughs)

18:41.453 --> 18:42.888
Wow.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.162
(yawns) I've had a lovely sleep.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.297
Me, too.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.366
It's so nice having James here.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.836
I wouldn't hate being here
if I knew I could have him with us.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.852
Sometimes I love
being in this house.

19:13.919 --> 19:18.423
But sometimes, I hate it with every
fucking single fibre of my being.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.692
I don't know if I wanna be here.

19:20.759 --> 19:21.960
(sighs)

19:31.069 --> 19:34.172
One thing's for certain,
I need to get out of this house

19:34.239 --> 19:37.609
and away from these bellends
if I wanna make a decision.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.080
Hi, Vick. What you doing?

19:44.716 --> 19:45.717
Packing.

19:45.784 --> 19:49.054
We go upstairs and we find Vicky
packing. What the fuck?

19:49.121 --> 19:53.325
I just think I need a bit of time
to meself, I think.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.462
Just, er, with James,
to meself and James.

19:57.529 --> 20:02.301
Vicky's leaving with James and she's
packed all of her stuff already. Eh?

20:02.367 --> 20:05.737
I need to sit down for this.
But I just think, like,

20:05.804 --> 20:10.342
when James came, like,
I was truly happy.

20:10.409 --> 20:14.947
I realised, like, when he's around,
that is when I'm at me happiest.

20:15.013 --> 20:18.817
I hope Vicky leaving doesn't
make her wanna be here any more.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.986
It wouldn't be the same without her.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.124
Yeah, I'm gonna leave with James.

20:26.191 --> 20:30.228
Vicky's boyfriend come. We thought
that would've made her feel better.

20:30.295 --> 20:33.165
But it's made her feel like
she misses him more.

20:33.231 --> 20:36.668
Just a couple of days
to get me head round everything.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.571
You'll feel miles better.
See if I can cheer up.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.974
This won't be the last
we'll see of Vicky.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.011
A few days off to get bucked, she'll
come back with a smile on her face.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.746
See yous.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.683
See yous, lasses.
Bye, Vick. Love ya.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.254
Charlotte is walking
down the stairs butt naked.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.023
(both) # I'm gonna get mortal #

20:58.090 --> 21:00.292
Somebody pass me a cup. (gags)

21:01.493 --> 21:03.161
Stop naming vegetables!

21:03.228 --> 21:06.965
I'm gonna get Charlotte's initials
tattooed behind my ear.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.001
What the hell am I meant to say?

21:09.067 --> 21:11.570
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:13.805 --> 21:14.006
.

21:16.508 --> 21:16.708
.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.253
(phone rings)
Phone!

21:29.187 --> 21:33.525
With Vicky gone and the phone
ringing, it's gonna be Anna for work.

21:33.592 --> 21:38.263
If there's any chance of anyone being
the new boss, I'm getting in first.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.331
Hello.

21:40.666 --> 21:41.667
It is, yeah.

21:43.602 --> 21:46.405
She's not,
she's, er, left with her boyfriend.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.774
She's left.

21:55.514 --> 21:59.151
I think I'd make a much better boss
than Vicky. She's shit.

22:05.323 --> 22:06.758
No problem. Thank you.

22:06.825 --> 22:11.463
I answered the phone. I could say I'm
the new boss and no-one would know.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.265
I'm the new boss.

22:13.331 --> 22:15.467
(laughter)

22:15.534 --> 22:17.903
No, I'm joking.
I was gonna say!

22:17.969 --> 22:19.771
Work for yous two.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.340
Lucky you.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.377
I'm getting ready for work.
I'm excited it's with Kyle.

22:25.444 --> 22:29.047
It's a perfect opportunity to clear
this fake fanny business up.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.818
I don't think I look that bad.
I look like a fucking dick.

22:32.884 --> 22:36.054
You do realise that's not a hat,
that's Holly's handbag.

22:36.121 --> 22:38.023
(laughter)

22:38.090 --> 22:41.727
I'm not keen on the fancy dress,
but I'm buzzing it's me and Holly.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.730
It'll be nice to get out the house.
Leaflets.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.699
You single and looking for love?
There you go.

22:47.766 --> 22:51.203
So are you OK, like,
after yesterday, now?

22:51.269 --> 22:56.374
I tell Kyle that I wasn't trying to
insult him. I thought it was a laugh.

23:05.150 --> 23:09.221
I know I overreacted when Holly gave
me the fanny. It felt like a dig.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.223
It's the first time I've said,

23:11.289 --> 23:14.893
"I'm gonna change and not go out
and bang a fucking random bird."

23:14.960 --> 23:18.697
It's obvious I do like Holly,
but it's new and scary.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.166
But I definitely wanna
see it through.

23:29.708 --> 23:33.979
I'm so glad we've cleared the air.
The King of Hearts has his tart back.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.081
Do you wanna hold me hand?
What?

23:36.148 --> 23:39.684
Do you wanna hold my hand?
Do you want a leaflet? No.

23:47.959 --> 23:52.397
Everyone's proper buzzing. There's
no Marnie so it means no drama

23:52.464 --> 23:56.735
and no Vicky so it means everyone
can actually have a good night.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.270
Cheers.

24:00.605 --> 24:05.076
I cannot wait until the first drink
is in my hand. Bring it on.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.814
(both) # I'm gonna get mortal and
There's no-one here to look after us

24:08.880 --> 24:12.984
# I'm gonna get mortal
There's only just the two of us #

24:16.354 --> 24:19.691
We're get to TupTup.
Everyone's buzzing for a mint night.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.765
Everyone's loving life.
It's always amazing

24:26.832 --> 24:29.134
when we have a good night
and no drama.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.173
Aaron is literally
a different person tonight.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.277
No worry, no stress, having fun.
This is the Aaron I know.

24:45.517 --> 24:48.486
I never realised how much pressure
I felt with Marnie.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.488
Without her I can just enjoy meself.

24:54.926 --> 24:58.563
Tonight is amazing. Me and Holly
are on such a love buzz.

25:09.074 --> 25:14.012
I'm so happy at the minute but I'm
worrying that it's not gonna last.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.964
Fuck, I am absolutely mortal.
Somebody pass me a bucket.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.267
Oh, no, wait, there's a cup.
(retches)

25:36.801 --> 25:41.206
Holly's had too many shots and she's
being sick in a cup. That's cool.

25:47.812 --> 25:50.282
We're all smashed.
We've had a mint night.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.484
Now it's time to fuck off
to the nest.

26:00.525 --> 26:03.261
Ah-woo!

26:03.328 --> 26:06.898
So we get home, and Gary's gotta
carry us in cos I can't walk.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.334
I am literally so smashed.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.506
(all) One, two, three, show.
Me and the lads are proper mortal,

26:14.572 --> 26:19.277
so it's time to see who has to neck
a red onion and garlic cocktail.

26:19.344 --> 26:23.048
(all) One, two, three, show.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.183
What a fucking liberty. I lost.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.618
Man, I'm hungry!

26:26.685 --> 26:29.020
(all talk)

26:29.087 --> 26:30.088
Ugh!

26:30.155 --> 26:31.890
Yeah!

26:32.958 --> 26:34.960
(all groan)

26:35.026 --> 26:39.130
That drink smelt like Charlotte's
armpits the day before big wash.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.637
Sick is something
that I can't deal with.

26:45.704 --> 26:48.173
Once Scott starts being sick,
so do I.

26:59.517 --> 27:02.087
Things are going really well
with me and Kyle.

27:02.153 --> 27:05.590
It just seems quite surreal.
I think he feels the same.

27:13.031 --> 27:16.868
I've had a wicked night with Holly,
but she's paranoid I'll hurt her.

27:16.935 --> 27:20.271
I don't know how to convince her
I'm not that guy.

27:21.806 --> 27:26.244
Me and Kyle are getting a lot closer,
so I invite him into my bed

27:26.311 --> 27:30.315
for a bit of a special cuddle.
And dry humping's classy, right?

27:35.120 --> 27:40.158
Charlotte is absolutely mortal so I'm
gonna be a gent and put her to bed.

27:45.063 --> 27:49.734
It turns out I'm not quite ready
for bed yet. I need one last outing.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.737
But I seem to have
forgotten something.

27:52.804 --> 27:55.106
What the fuck...?

27:55.173 --> 27:59.210
Am I seeing things here? Charlotte is
walking down the stairs butt naked.

27:59.277 --> 28:01.479
Come here, Char, I'll sort you out.

28:09.654 --> 28:11.923
Nope. I can't be sleeping in there.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.359
Definitely not in there.

28:18.096 --> 28:21.666
Don't bother looking,
I'll just go choose another bed.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.418
I've woke up,
it's like fucking bed swap.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.687
I'm in Kyle's bed,
Charlotte's in mine.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.289
You piss my bed?

28:44.355 --> 28:46.925
I didn't wee in yours, but, like,

28:46.991 --> 28:51.296
I may have had wee on the body,
you might need to wash your quilt.

28:51.362 --> 28:52.664
Ugh!

28:52.730 --> 28:56.534
That scruffy bitch, she wants to
wash them sheets before I go nuts.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.336
Did you miss Marnie last night?

29:04.609 --> 29:06.945
Last night was drama free
without Marnie

29:07.011 --> 29:10.348
and as much as I do fancy her,
we just don't work.

29:15.987 --> 29:21.126
I feel like...
you've been very... respectful.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.695
I can't talk about sex
in the morning

29:23.761 --> 29:25.964
because I've got a morning rock on.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.302
I'm surprised there's enough room
for me in this bed.

29:31.369 --> 29:34.205
Kyle's balls must be the size
of giant watermelons.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.656
What do you do when you've got
nothing on? Go and get tattooed.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.062
All right. I'll go first.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.132
To remember our time here,
we're gonna get a blue skull.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.936
Is it hurting?
It is at the minute, mate.

30:07.038 --> 30:10.175
I'm surprised there's
any room to fucking tattoo,

30:10.241 --> 30:14.512
he's probably gonna end up with
that blue skull on his arsehole.

30:16.247 --> 30:18.650
Before I leave,
I've had a genius idea.

30:18.716 --> 30:21.486
I'm gonna get Charlotte's
initials behind my ear.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.459
It's fake.
Charlotte doesn't know that.

30:28.526 --> 30:31.095
She will shit herself.
It'll be so funny.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.264
Thank you very much. See you later.

30:39.470 --> 30:43.141
We get back and we're buzzing.
Can't wait to show everyone.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.343
So what have yous been doing?

30:45.410 --> 30:48.479
Tattoos. Howay, let's see.
Blue skull crew.

30:48.546 --> 30:51.449
Oh, my God, that's so cool.
Wow, I love it!

30:51.516 --> 30:55.920
The perfect chance to get Charlotte
outside, show her the fake tattoo.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.226
No, please don't say this is true.

31:04.295 --> 31:05.797
Look.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.067
(both laugh)

31:09.133 --> 31:15.039
Gary has gone and got C-L-C
behind his ear. What?

31:15.106 --> 31:16.441
That isn't real.

31:19.911 --> 31:22.647
Who in their right mind
would do that?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.616
You gotta get G-B behind your ear.

31:24.682 --> 31:27.652
I can't, because, er...

31:27.719 --> 31:30.655
(both laugh)

31:30.722 --> 31:32.390
What the hell am I meant to say?

31:33.291 --> 31:34.492
...because...

31:34.559 --> 31:36.327
Come on, then.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.795
Because...

31:38.863 --> 31:41.165
Because (laughs)...

31:41.232 --> 31:43.234
Because I...

31:45.370 --> 31:47.839
What the fuck?
Where's this came from?

31:47.905 --> 31:50.808
I thought things were going
really well, now this.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.844
I like you, but I don't...

31:52.910 --> 31:55.880
It's nothing like
how I liked you before. Yeah.

31:55.947 --> 32:00.618
And I'm scared that I'll start
to like you like that again.

32:00.685 --> 32:03.888
I'm telling Gary to pull,
but I don't know what I want.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.124
This has moved far too quickly,

32:06.190 --> 32:09.427
and I'm starting to feel
really wobbly about it.

32:14.732 --> 32:17.969
I'm not just gonna go out
and grab the first bird.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.404
I dunno.
I won't.

32:19.470 --> 32:22.240
I thought this time
we were getting things right.

32:22.307 --> 32:25.643
I've enjoyed being her boyfriend.
I thought we could work.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.612
Right, that's fine.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.784
Fuck. What have I done? I've just
told Gary that he can go pull.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.988
I'm scared cos I don't want him
to pull. Why have I said that?

32:37.055 --> 32:39.724
Oh, my God. What the hell?

32:44.095 --> 32:46.698
Marnie's back.
I knew the good times had to end.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.966
Do not fucking take me for a mug.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.835
He told me he didn't wanna pull.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.140
What the fuck is going on?
Gis a cuddle.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.042
Why don't you suck each other off?

32:58.109 --> 33:00.078
Boyfriend Club is out the window.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.480
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:04.882 --> 33:05.083
.

33:07.585 --> 33:07.785
.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.969
Everyone's getting ready. Charlotte
says I can pull and she wants me to.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.871
I am so fucking confused.

33:33.711 --> 33:38.149
Charlotte said she wants Gary to
pull. But he doesn't want to. Eh?

33:38.216 --> 33:40.985
The old Gaz would've jumped
at the chance.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.024
I've been away for two nights.
Now I'm back to face the music

33:47.091 --> 33:51.095
after all the trouble I've caused.
I've got some apologising to do.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.667
It feels like she's been gone
forever.

33:56.734 --> 34:00.204
As long as she doesn't kick off,
it will be nice to have her back.

34:00.271 --> 34:03.741
I'm gonna apologise sincerely
about throwing the bottle

34:03.808 --> 34:04.909
cos that's awful.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.811
I don't wanna do stuff like that.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.648
After I threw that bottle, I was
simply too embarrassed to stay.

34:11.949 --> 34:16.454
Me and Aaron need to sort this out.
I may as well get it over with.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.022
Hiya.
You all right?

34:18.089 --> 34:19.657
How are you?
Sound.

34:19.724 --> 34:23.895
Marnie's back. I knew the good times
had to end at some point. Shit.

34:23.960 --> 34:28.166
I'm so sorry for... I still can't
understand how that escalated.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.934
We were having such a good time.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.402
You slapped us, man.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.739
I was drunk, I didn't realise
how hard I slapped you.

34:34.806 --> 34:39.177
Me and Marnie would be too explosive
as a couple. All we do is argue.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.679
I went home and thought about
things. You know what I've thought?

34:42.746 --> 34:46.083
As much as I find it hard,
cos I really like you,

34:46.150 --> 34:49.219
I feel like we need
to stay away from each other.

34:49.286 --> 34:53.491
Marnie thinks she's ending things
with me. I'm ending things with you.

34:53.558 --> 34:57.929
You do your thing, I'll do my thing.
We should be friends and that's it.

34:57.995 --> 35:00.498
Once feelings got involved,
that happens.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.535
Me and Aaron don't work. Even though
I know I'm doing the right thing,

35:04.602 --> 35:07.371
I feel sad cos I still like him.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.574
Right, OK.
Sound. See you later.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.279
We're getting ready. Tonight is me
first night as a single lad.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.882
I'm gonna dive in head first.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.054
(all talk)

35:27.291 --> 35:31.362
I hope House of Smith is ready cos
we are goning radge tonight, like.

35:39.036 --> 35:41.539
I'm looking at Gary doing
his stupid dancing.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.008
I'm thinking,
"Why'd I say you could pull?"

35:57.588 --> 36:02.093
That's it. It's time to see whether
Gary's love is water resistant.

36:06.397 --> 36:10.334
What the fuck? It's not even real.
Half of us is really glad,

36:10.401 --> 36:13.971
but the other half is gutted.
I really thought he'd done that.

36:18.175 --> 36:21.178
I was gonna tell you
that the tattoo wasn't real,

36:21.245 --> 36:26.384
until you dropped the bombshell of me
pulling girls. So I kept it going.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.962
All the lads on the dance floor.
Aaron's single,

36:38.029 --> 36:39.730
Gary's got the green light.

36:39.797 --> 36:42.600
It's nice
I've got a girl to go back to.

36:54.512 --> 36:58.015
So Kyle's come back
from the dance floor with a girl.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.051
Are you having a fucking laugh?

37:04.989 --> 37:09.393
Mate? Mate my fucking arse!
Keep cool, Holly, keep cool.

37:20.471 --> 37:25.409
Why the fuck are you doing this,
Kyle? Get away from the girl.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.887
These girls are mint.

37:36.954 --> 37:41.192
I hope I don't have to choose cos
there's plenty of me to go around.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.469
I see two wicked blonde birds.

37:51.535 --> 37:54.405
It's not that I wanna pull,
but I'll go talk to them.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.874
That'll teach Charlotte.

38:03.247 --> 38:06.450
Gaz has spotted the blondies
I've been cracking on with.

38:06.517 --> 38:10.187
You'd think
he would have learnt his lesson.

38:11.722 --> 38:12.923
I'm goning in.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.267
Scott comes steaming in
and starts squaring up.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.672
I was just talking to them.

38:33.544 --> 38:37.048
What is going on? They need to sort
their fucking heads out.

38:39.283 --> 38:41.919
Scott goes ballistic.
Mate, what's the matter?

38:41.986 --> 38:45.756
I was talking to a girl that
I thought I was allowed to talk to.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.924
Turns out, I'm not.

38:54.265 --> 38:58.235
Fuck this. I'm gonna tell Charlotte
what that prick has been up to.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.143
What a fucking prick.

39:06.210 --> 39:10.214
Not only has Gary fucked Scott over,
he's also tried to pull.

39:10.281 --> 39:13.484
We're fucking through.
I feel fucking free because of it.

39:15.986 --> 39:20.157
It's all gone tits up. I need
to go and sort out the drama.

39:24.595 --> 39:27.998
Kyle's walking his friend out
and gives her a goodbye kiss.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.968
And then another kiss.
And then another fucking kiss.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.471
What the fuck,
are you taking the piss?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.612
You necked on with her.
No, I didn't.

39:47.585 --> 39:50.387
Are you kidding?
Are you fucking kidding us?

39:50.454 --> 39:53.357
I cannot believe
I've been accused of necking on.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.359
All I did was kiss me mate goodbye.

39:57.361 --> 40:02.133
I seen it with my own eyes.
Do not fucking take me for a mug.

40:08.205 --> 40:10.641
I can't be fucked with this.
I'm off.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.411
Why the fuck is this happening again?

40:14.478 --> 40:16.781
Holly's really upset. She's sobbing.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.183
Kyle just went too far this time.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.053
I told him I liked him.
I fucking told him everything.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.923
He told me he didn't wanna pull.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.460
This has been one of my worst
fucking nights in Geordie Shore.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.396
I can't fucking wait to get home
and get to bed.

40:40.404 --> 40:44.175
So come with Scott, and we'll go...
and I'll explain the situation.

40:44.241 --> 40:48.245
We get back. Me and Scott are gonna
get it sorted once and for all.

40:48.312 --> 40:51.282
I didn't want any of it.
Just forget it, forget it.

40:51.348 --> 40:54.985
Blonde birds, fucking brunette birds,
nothing happened, right?

40:58.255 --> 40:59.924
Gis a fucking cuddle.

40:59.990 --> 41:04.662
Fuck all these arguments. We should
all have one big fucking cuddle.

41:04.728 --> 41:07.364
Why don't you
suck each other off now?

41:07.431 --> 41:10.601
Gary and Scott have made up,
but I'm still furious with Gary

41:10.668 --> 41:13.037
for arguing about a girl
in the first place.

41:15.105 --> 41:19.476
Yous are arguing about it in front
of our faces. It's disrespectful.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.348
Yeah. You did try, until Scott
kicked off at you. I didn't.

41:24.415 --> 41:29.453
Charlotte comes in absolutely raging.
How many times? I didn't wanna pull.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.423
Telling us to do it,
you're angry cos I talked.

41:32.489 --> 41:35.292
Kyle, you're fucking supposed
to be liking Holly.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.895
What? I haven't done anything wrong.

41:37.962 --> 41:40.364
You ignored her.
I ignored her?

41:40.431 --> 41:44.668
Yeah, you did. Why would Holly
be in tears for no reason?

41:44.735 --> 41:47.838
Charlotte's having a go.
She needs to keep her nose out.

41:47.905 --> 41:51.508
Just cos her and Gary aren't working
out, don't take that out on me.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.447
The relationships are all over.

41:56.513 --> 41:59.984
We're literally living in a house
of warfare.

42:02.253 --> 42:06.590
The girls and boys have separated.
The Boyfriend Club is out the window.

42:18.002 --> 42:19.336
I need to speak to Holly.

42:19.403 --> 42:22.940
I know if I leave it the girls
will poison her against us.

42:23.007 --> 42:26.243
I did kiss her,
but it wasn't a neck on.

42:26.310 --> 42:29.780
Just because I give me mate a kiss
doesn't mean I'm pulling.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.249
Holly needs to realise
what I'm giving up.

42:32.316 --> 42:36.287
I feel as though because I'm not
having sex with you, you think...

42:36.353 --> 42:40.724
...I don't like you, because of that,
when really it's the opposite.

42:40.791 --> 42:44.561
Holly's telling us she's not
sleeping with us cos she likes us.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.698
I've never had that before.
It's difficult to handle.

42:47.765 --> 42:53.771
I'm literally wearing my heart on my
sleeve here. I didn't wanna like you.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.639
I never wanted this.

42:55.706 --> 43:00.077
This is shit. I really, really like
Kyle and I feel like I'm losing him.

43:00.144 --> 43:03.280
I don't know how long
I'm gonna fucking wait for you.

43:12.189 --> 43:14.725
(shouts excitedly) Whoo-hoo.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.427
Ho, ho, ho. Why-aye.

43:19.129 --> 43:22.366
It's like one big, hot tub orgy.

43:23.400 --> 43:27.237
I feel like I'm about to pop
my cherry for the first time.

43:27.304 --> 43:30.174
Being together on Christmas Day
was just amazing.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.109
Oh, my God, it's Vicky.

43:32.176 --> 43:35.079
She's got something to say.
It is over.

43:35.145 --> 43:39.917
I just love her so much and I don't
want her to go. I'm sorry.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.987
That's one way
to kill the fucking buzz.

44:07.878 --> 44:08.078
.
