WEBVTT

00:13.720 --> 00:19.000
<i>Edward marched his forces to Eoferwic,</i>
<i>where he received momentous news.</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:23.280
We have been both blessed and cursed.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.360
There can be no more bastards.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.720
We are to be wed.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.880
Let us fetch a priest.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.000
So soon, Father?

00:32.080 --> 00:33.760
So I am to be replaced also.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.360
<i>Aelfweard left the city</i>
<i>with reluctant company…</i>

00:37.439 --> 00:38.800
Journey to where?

00:38.880 --> 00:40.320
To join my grandfather.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.160
<i>…for Aethelhelm had traveled north</i>

00:43.240 --> 00:46.160
<i>and made an alliance</i>
<i>with King Constantin of Scotland.</i>

00:46.240 --> 00:48.840
You help me raise rebellion
against the king,

00:48.920 --> 00:52.640
we put my grandson
on the throne in Wessex,

00:52.720 --> 00:56.960
we would offer half the profits
from the lands of Mercia

00:57.040 --> 00:59.760
through a marriage bond
to the Lady Aelfwynn.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.000
<i>Lady Aelswith failed</i>
<i>in her attempt to free Aelfwynn…</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:04.720
<i>-…from Aethelhelm's men.</i>

01:05.840 --> 01:07.880
Do not fight it!

01:11.360 --> 01:14.560
-Aelfwynn! Run!

01:14.640 --> 01:17.360
-<i>Following Sigtryggr's death,</i>

01:17.440 --> 01:20.840
<i>Stiorra sought revenge</i>
<i>against those who brought her sorrow.</i>

01:20.920 --> 01:22.760
Please tell me
Brida is your captive.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.880
I cannot.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.680
Then tell me she will be mine
so that I may punish her.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.880
<i>Knowing our fates are entwined,</i>
<i>I answered Brida's call.</i>

01:31.960 --> 01:36.880
<i>We both knew this was a fight to</i>
<i>the death, but our bonds were too deep.</i>

01:37.440 --> 01:38.680
I will not kill you.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.240
If there was hope before,
there can be hope again.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.200


01:45.040 --> 01:47.520
-What have you done?!
-Ragnar…

01:48.840 --> 01:50.120
<i> Destiny is all.</i>

01:53.560 --> 01:56.320


01:56.400 --> 01:58.400


02:26.560 --> 02:29.840
-<i>What are you doing here?</i>

02:58.760 --> 03:00.360
I will see you in Valhalla.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.120
Stiorra.

03:13.000 --> 03:13.880
Stiorra!

03:15.840 --> 03:19.200
Stiorra! Why will you not speak with me?

03:19.280 --> 03:22.760
I have freed you from her curse,
there is nothing more for us to say.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.840
She did not curse me.
She was coming back to me.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.280
She could have been saved.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.880
Sigtryggr did not have
the chance to be saved.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.960
I will never understand
why you were granting it to her.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.560
You could have stopped her,
but you never did.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.240
You let this happen, many times.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.080
It is done. It is over now.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.600
Stiorra, please come with me.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.320
We can go home.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.680
You have no home.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.000
You have nothing to offer me.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.760
Stiorra, you have suffered too much.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.360
No! Those who have hurt me
have suffered too little.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.200
No one has felt pain like I have endured.
Not yet.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.000
Your life is not over.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.840
Yes, you have lost,
but you will find new purpose.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.400
We carry our losses,
but we journey onward.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.200
I will journey onward, yes,
but not with you.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.320
We will build here.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.680
There is wood and fresh water and loyalty.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.920
Other Danes are coming.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.399
-We will live as Danes and die as Danes.
-You will not find peace here.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.360
Then I will find it
in Sigtryggr's dead embrace.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.080
No, do not say that.
That path is not meant for you.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.720
That is not what the gods want.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.640
I no longer believe in destiny.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.560
You have always spoken as though
every action is part of some plan.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.160
Everything you have done has been excused
because it was not your choice.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.600
That is not true.
I have not walked blindly.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.720
All your battles,
all those you have killed.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.560
You chose them over your family
and called it fate.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.600
What your destiny has brought me
is pain and grief.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.520
So now my choice
is to turn my back on you.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.400
-Yah!

06:13.520 --> 06:15.520


06:24.920 --> 06:26.920


06:45.720 --> 06:47.080
Lord Aethelhelm…

06:50.000 --> 06:51.160
You have visitors.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.080
-The Lady Aelfwynn is here?
-No.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.320
Then kindly tell them I will attend
when I am ready.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.680
I am not your lackey.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.480
You may be an ally of King Constantin,
but you are a guest in my fortress--

07:12.560 --> 07:13.480
I am ready.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.200
Who is here for me?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.000
-Your grandson.
-Aelfweard?

07:18.680 --> 07:19.840
Why did you not say?

07:30.080 --> 07:34.200
Now, this, this is a mercy!

07:34.280 --> 07:37.120
Oh, beloved child of my child!

07:37.200 --> 07:39.120
At last we're reunited.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.920
-Oh, no.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.640
Oh, now, whatever is the matter?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.560
You've been told of my mother's death?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.240
Of course.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.280
And though my heart is broken...

07:56.480 --> 08:01.080
having you here is some reprieve
from the unending sadness.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.520
My father has already remarried.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.880
The new queen is with child.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.440
Ah.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.880
It will likely be a boy,
your father's seed is strong,

08:10.960 --> 08:14.080
and should he view you
as a threat to the succession,

08:14.160 --> 08:16.160
then your life will be in danger.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.880
My worst fears come to pass.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.600
I… I do not think he would harm me.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.840
The king can be most… unforgiving.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.280
Indeed, in my darkest hours,

08:28.360 --> 08:32.040
I imagine your mother's death
was on his command.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.960
No, it was the Danes.

08:34.880 --> 08:39.320
He may not have loved her as we did,
but… but that he would not do.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.760
Of course. I am sure you are right.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.760
But everything we do hence
is to honor her hopes for you.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.160
Are we united?

08:51.240 --> 08:54.480
Always. With a whole heart.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.000
And Father Benedict.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.680
Welcome to Bebbanburg!

09:09.000 --> 09:11.480
My everlasting thanks
for bringing the boy.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.400
All debt to me is paid.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.840
Twice over.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.240
Now come,
tonight we celebrate your arrival.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.640
Drink well, feast well, all.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.920
Great energy will be required
for the times ahead.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.440
Eat!

09:55.240 --> 09:56.360
How are we to proceed?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.440
Well, first…

10:04.760 --> 10:05.600
A wedding.

10:07.520 --> 10:12.080
King Constantin of Scotland travels here
to be married…

10:13.440 --> 10:14.720
to Lady Aelfwynn.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.960
My cousin is here?
May I see her?

10:18.040 --> 10:21.120
She has not yet arrived,
despite your grandfather's promises--

10:21.200 --> 10:24.160
She will be here.
She's simply taking her time.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.440
-Like all women, she rides slowly.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.280
She wishes to marry this King Constantin?
I would not want her to be forced.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.040
She will understand
that it is for the best, my boy.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.960
It seals your alliance
with the Scottish king

10:38.040 --> 10:40.720
and gives him reason
to support our rebellion.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.880
It will provoke your father to war.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.920
A war? I thought you said
we could do this without bloodshed--

10:47.000 --> 10:48.800
Not war.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.680
Confrontation, which we will win.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.160
Some blood may be spilled,
some villages burned, but…

11:05.360 --> 11:08.600
We will present the king
with our superior strength

11:08.680 --> 11:11.280
and he will concede defeat.

11:11.360 --> 11:16.840
And in return for that concession,
you will be declared the next king.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.440
Then it will be an end.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.200
Or your father will be killed.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.880
Grandfather, reassure me
to kill my father is not part of the plan.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.000
I am a man of peace.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.040
All I do is for the good of the Saxons.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.840
Edward, he's grown tyrannical.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.960
Tell that to the Danes of Rumcofa
killed on your order.

11:44.120 --> 11:49.080
Each one complicit
in the murder of my daughter!

11:50.240 --> 11:52.640
Do not doubt me on this, Benedict.

11:53.640 --> 12:00.560
I have proved many times
that I am righteous in word and deed.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.040
Then I would hate for you
to meet that which you dread.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.760
I should like to pray, alone.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.280
I have verses I must study.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.000
Perhaps there are

12:18.080 --> 12:23.760
some wise words
in the book about the sort of man I am.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.680
Perhaps you do not know me as you think.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.320
Lord King,
word has returned from the south.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.360
Aelfweard is not in Winchester,
nor anywhere in Wessex.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.640
Do you think he went to Aethelhelm?

13:07.440 --> 13:08.600
It would seem likely.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.720
Though we know not where.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.120
The ingratitude.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.720
The dishonor of it.
How could the boy be so foolish?

13:17.960 --> 13:21.760
He is still in grief for his mother
and our marriage was quite hasty.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.880
-Do not attempt to dilute my anger.
-He is a boy. As my child will be a boy.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.280
No mother wants
to see a man reject his son.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.920
As ever, you speak with reason.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.760
I am wounded by his betrayal.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.160
As you should be.
It is a grievous offense.

13:43.240 --> 13:48.080
I thought I had more mastery of things,
but now I find myself reacting yet again

13:48.160 --> 13:51.280
to Aethelhelm's provocation,
unable to gain the momentum.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.200
Dragging myself on horseback to chase him.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.520
The momentum brought you Eoferwic.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.480
And your boldness against Sigtryggr
won you a kingdom that eluded your father.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.720
At whose arrangements? Aethelhelm's.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.560
-That is a cruel irony, yes, but it--
-I fear it is more than that.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.920
What does this mean?

14:14.080 --> 14:17.240
All of it, why… why does it occur?

14:18.520 --> 14:21.760
In unreasonable haste,
I win Mercia and Eoferwic.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.400
Two conquests that evaded kings
greater than I--

14:25.480 --> 14:27.080
-You deserve your success.
-Do I?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.640
Perhaps God tests me.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.680
Or perhaps the devil tempts me
to overplay my hand.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.880
This humiliation...

14:37.640 --> 14:42.880
this betrayal by my son…

14:48.960 --> 14:52.400
…it is a moment that challenges my pride
and I must think clearly.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.320
Aelfweard is lost to me.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.280
Were we to find him,
this I would struggle to forgive.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.960
To flee the palace and ally with a man

15:08.040 --> 15:10.360
who has done so much wrong
to me and to Wessex,

15:10.440 --> 15:12.040
I do not think I can forgive it.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.480
We have another son in your belly.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.480
Perhaps I should accept
Aelfweard is forfeit

15:29.560 --> 15:32.480
and allow him to range
like a fugitive with Aethelhelm.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.760
That will mean he is always a threat.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.800
Better a threat away from Winchester
than within the palace.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.600
Well, it would take great strength
to ignore such an offense.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.720
I know and I struggle with it,
but my heart tells me

15:55.800 --> 15:59.440
to not once again take the bait
Aethelhelm has cast upon the waters.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.840
I ignore provocation,
fortify enough to rebuff them,

16:07.920 --> 16:10.880
but do not chase them down
and walk into a trap.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.000
Am I foolish? Is that the devil's course?

16:18.680 --> 16:19.640
Well, I…

16:21.560 --> 16:24.120
I would never try to guess
the mind of the devil.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.720
Just as I would never suggest
you forfeit your son for my child.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.400
But as one who counsels you, I would say

16:34.480 --> 16:37.640
it is a wise strategy
to settle for these gains.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.840
You control three of the four kingdoms.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.120
In time, our son can fight for the last.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.120
There is no dishonor in this path
if you choose it with a clean heart.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.280
-If I do not play, Aethelhelm cannot win.
-Mm.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.040
He then dances to my song.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.400
And I prevail.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.680
After the fight is over…

17:08.840 --> 17:10.880
when we agree a truce,

17:12.480 --> 17:14.319
we build a new palace…

17:16.880 --> 17:18.079
in Lundene.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.440
It stands between Mercia and Wessex.
It's well placed for trade.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.240
It should be at the heart
of your new kingdom.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.240
This is all very ambitious, Grandfather.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.119
I only hope I'm worthy
of your faith in me.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.800
It is not mere faith! It is your blood!

17:38.280 --> 17:40.240
With the right advice...

17:40.800 --> 17:46.360
your people will sing of you
as Aelfweard the Great!

17:46.440 --> 17:52.200
Your reign will hold in the same esteem
as Charlemagne!

17:54.640 --> 17:59.440
And we will raise a minster
to your dear mother.

18:00.560 --> 18:06.440
Under your rule, never again
will a heathen harm any of our people.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.600
Never will a boy lose his mother
as you did.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.120
-Is he drunk?
-He has not been on the ale.

18:20.200 --> 18:25.680
I think perhaps he really believes
he can unseat the Saxon king.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.280
Maybe it's time to kiss his arse?

18:30.360 --> 18:33.360
I am a man of low principles.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.000
-I prefer to call you pragmatic, Lord.
-Mm.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.040
Yet even I would not stoop
to seek the favor of that…

18:43.120 --> 18:44.800
…Wessex turd.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.000
I am not certain that our host
welcomes your ambition.

18:58.360 --> 19:03.360
Then he will learn what happens
when you cross men like us.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.000
You! Boy!

19:09.080 --> 19:12.720
-Fetch me ale! Fetch ale for your king.
-Ye… Yes, Lord.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.320
Watch his back hoof, he's tired.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.360
I have abused his good nature.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.720
Uhtred.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.960
She failed to kill me.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.640
What a joy
to see you well, Pyrlig.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.240
-Did you find her?
-Yes, I found her.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.760
Where is she now?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.480
She's with the gods.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.280
-You decided to kill her?
-No.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.880
You were right. But, uh…

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
I will tell you all.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.040
For now I want you to go to your sister.
She has secluded herself in the forest.

20:12.120 --> 20:17.280
I want you to find her, speak with her
and make her come to Rumcofa.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.920
Why has she gone to the forest?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.920
She believes there's no place for her,
but she's wrong.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.560
She has suffered much, Uhtred.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.680
Perhaps it is wiser to let her be
rather than to command her.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.000
No, I shall not abandon her again.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.640
I will prove there is a place
for her in Rumcofa.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.040
And that I can be a true father.

20:36.120 --> 20:41.280
Father, the sentiment is truly noble,
but Stiorra has been a queen.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.520
She cannot live
in Rumcofa as a trader's wife.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.440
Besides, too much has happened there
for it to be a place of sanctuary.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.160
Nevertheless, it is all we have.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.640
Lord!

21:01.920 --> 21:04.080
Ah. You're alive.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.000
I am.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.760
And Brida?

21:07.640 --> 21:09.120
No.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.320
I know you did what you could.
At least it's over now, hmm?

21:16.680 --> 21:19.480
We know you will have chosen
the right path, Uhtred.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.040
You should take some time, rest yourself.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.560
Indeed.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.680
I was thinking it is time we go back
to the peace of Rumcofa.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.120
I promised I'd return you
to your families.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.600
The danger's over now.
We can stop running for Wessex,

21:36.680 --> 21:39.040
make some coin from the toll
on the trade river.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.520
Fight the raiders,
go back to how things were.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.240
Lord, no.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.680
Our families have fled to Wessex, Lord.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.880
They have settled.
They are waiting for us.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.160
Our lives in Rumcofa are destroyed.
Let the dead rest in peace, hey?

21:58.040 --> 22:03.160
But it can be a home,
a real home for us, for our families.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.720
-Aethelstan, you loved it there.
-I did.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.120
-I do wish to be alongside you--
-And I want you there.

22:11.200 --> 22:17.160
I also wish to serve my father.
He needs loyalty. And I… I need--

22:17.240 --> 22:19.920
I understand.
You will come visit us, I'm sure.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.760
Lord…

22:22.880 --> 22:26.840
Uhtred, we are brothers for life,
thick and thin.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.080
We'll ride with you to death.
You know that.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.840
But this is not the right choice, Lord.
Our time in Rumcofa has passed.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.200
There… There are too many things there
to remind us of what we have lost.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.720
But we cannot roam forever.

22:38.680 --> 22:42.080
We cannot leave our children
without a place to find comfort.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.800
Uhtred, come on!

22:43.880 --> 22:46.440
I've lost Stiorra
until I can offer her hope.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.560
I need you to agree.

22:54.920 --> 23:01.480
If you command Rumcofa, we'll follow you.
But I ask, is there another path?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.440
Open the front gate!

23:21.160 --> 23:26.360
A lesson for you, act with confidence,
providence smiles.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.240
Lady Aelfwynn.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.280
Will you come down from your horse?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.960
-Do I have any choice in the matter?
-Do not be afraid.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.160
I do not intend violence,
merely to bring peace.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.360
Where's Bresal?

23:52.840 --> 23:56.160
There was a fight.
He did not survive. I'm sorry, Lord.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.040
I know he was a good friend to you.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.920
The men I truly count as friends
do not die so easily.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.920
-Lord King!

24:32.240 --> 24:34.920
-One moment.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.840
-Lord King, Lady Aelswith is here.
-Yes.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.800
My King, whatever's the matter?

24:50.880 --> 24:53.480
Prepare for a new attack.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.880
-The Danes? Or Aethelhelm?
-Neither.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.280
Shorter and more vicious.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.520
Oh, my dearest son.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.120
Mother, what happened to your plan
to spirit Aelfwynn away from Mercia?

25:08.200 --> 25:12.760
It went awry and so I bring grave news.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.680
-Aelfwynn was captured on the road.
-By who?

25:15.760 --> 25:20.680
We are not certain, but one,
at least, did not survive my wrath.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.400
We believe them to be hired men.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.240
We suspect an association
with Lord Aethelhelm.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.760
Rouse Lord Aldhelm, tell him
I come imminently to discuss the matter.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.920
Send a command to search for her now!

25:42.400 --> 25:43.720
What is there to discuss?

25:44.640 --> 25:47.400
She is your blood and she is in danger.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.400
And that is to say nothing
of her value to your enemies.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.560
Edward, why do you hesitate?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.120
I'm not hesitating!

25:57.720 --> 26:00.400
I am simply not rushing blindly
into action.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.800
-Edward, why--
-Please do not argue with me, Mother.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.560
-She is Aethelflaed's child!
-I am aware of her bloodline.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.600
But I am also aware of Lord Aethelhelm.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.360
I will not react with haste to
this provocation, nor chase him blindly.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.840
We do not even know where he is,

26:14.920 --> 26:18.560
so allow me to follow what I know
to be the right path.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.160
Oh, you have not had the chance
to meet properly.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.080
-Mother, this is your new--
-I will not acknowledge

26:34.160 --> 26:36.200
whichever harlot you've decided to bed!

26:36.280 --> 26:38.400
I was going to say this is your new queen.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.880
Eadgifu and I are wed.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.320
She is with child.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.600
Well…

26:53.400 --> 26:56.520
A… A baby will be a blessing.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.440
Thank you.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.080
I… I did not mean to call you, um…

27:04.800 --> 27:08.160
I would kneel,
but my bones are stiff from--

27:08.240 --> 27:10.880
No, I quite understand.
You are no longer young in years--

27:10.960 --> 27:14.040
From slaughtering a man
with my bare hands.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.280
A slight exaggeration.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.880
I drove a knife through his neck.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.160
I was not wearing gloves.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.440
It has been an eventful time.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.280
Mm. Then you have surely earned
a good rest.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.360
I will ensure you are given
the grandest chamber in Eoferwic.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.200
The king and I can sleep elsewhere.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
It is my honor to honor you.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.840
I hope, in time,
you deem me worthy of your son.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
What has changed within my son, I wonder,

28:08.640 --> 28:11.800
that he has no appetite
to fight for his niece

28:11.880 --> 28:13.880
and against Lord Aethelhelm, no less?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.920
His new bride, perhaps?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.200
No, I do not think
the king's so easily distracted.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.200
Then he maneuvers in ways
I simply cannot understand.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.040
Lady Aelswith,
there is another possibility.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.400
You have silver.
You could easily buy the men to find her.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.760
Silver? For the honor
of saving the blood of Alfred?

28:37.840 --> 28:40.920
-I merely suggest--
-Men should be paying me

28:41.000 --> 28:43.520
for the privilege of fighting in her name.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.680
As ever, the Lord provides.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.600
I have a job for you.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.160
Lord Uhtred, it is Eadith.

29:11.720 --> 29:12.560
Yes?

29:17.360 --> 29:19.120
I thought you had left for Frankia.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.960
The gods had other ideas.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.400
It has been quite the journey.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.680
It is a relief to see you.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.560
Mm, do not be too hasty.
I bring only trouble.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.880
I have spoken with your men.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.400
They say you are returning to Rumcofa.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.160
I am.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.400
You are welcome to join us
should you wish.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.240
That is kind.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.480
Are you set on this path?

29:47.200 --> 29:52.400
Yes. I know the men have suffered there,

29:52.480 --> 29:57.800
but I have to take Stiorra away
from Eoferwic and the lands she has lost.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.360
A darkness has found her.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.560
What has happened to her?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.320
I did not stop it.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.800
I did not protect her.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.280
Well, perhaps I could talk with her.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.480
Find a way to cure her heart.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.560
I'm afraid it's already too late.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.320
For many years I was not there
when she needed me.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.360
I gave my life to Wessex and the Saxons.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.600
This feeling I know.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.840
My children have suffered.

30:46.600 --> 30:50.600
I never gave them a chance to live
as a family after they lost their mother.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.360
I thought that to be absent was to protect
them from the dangers I faced, but…

30:58.520 --> 31:02.000
I was not a father, not as they deserved.

31:07.760 --> 31:11.040
Stiorra is being swallowed by a dread.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.800
I've seen it before. In Brida.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.240
I've seen what it can do.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.880
She needs a place to heal,
to become herself again.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.080
And that place is Rumcofa?

31:25.120 --> 31:28.800
I do not know, but it is all I have got.

31:31.040 --> 31:37.960
-Why do you ask me of this?
-Aelfwynn has been taken by Aethelhelm.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.520
The king is reluctant to act,
so Lady Aelswith and I were wondering

31:44.600 --> 31:48.520
-if perhaps you might gather your men--
-No, Eadith, I cannot.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.720
She is Lady Aethelflaed's daughter.
You swore to protect her.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.760
I cannot give myself to others
when my daughter needs me!

32:02.040 --> 32:03.800
Lady Aelswith has silver.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.920
I've tried to persuade her to buy men,
but she will not. She's--

32:07.000 --> 32:08.920
The king should look to his duty.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.560
Not me, not you, the king.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.840
The king is deaf to it.

32:15.840 --> 32:19.040
I'm sorry.
I have to take care of my daughter.

32:24.880 --> 32:25.960
So, what shall I do?

32:33.520 --> 32:37.600
Uhtred,
whatever you need for this pursuit,

32:37.680 --> 32:38.960
Mercia will supply.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.280
-I will not be leaving to seek Aelfwynn.
-But you must.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.600
Edward has refused.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.120
And yet I cannot help Mercia with this.
In time the king will come to his senses.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.120
-Trust that I have my reasons.
-Of course.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.240
But, please, speak with the king
on this matter, he will not heed me on it.

33:00.320 --> 33:03.480
-Despite himself, he listens to you.
-Lord Aldhelm!

33:03.560 --> 33:05.080
Not today.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.200
Will you ask for me
to speak with the king?

33:08.280 --> 33:11.960
-I will summon you when the time is right.
-My business is urgent.

33:12.040 --> 33:17.120
-Lord Aethelhelm is fomenting rebellion.
-We know this. He will be stopped.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.320
I'm not so certain.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.520
He has the Scottish army on his side.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.680
He has made an alliance with Constantin

33:24.760 --> 33:27.160
and has offered him
the hand of Lady Aelfwynn.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.560
Of course. She is to be used in a bargain.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.400
How do you know this?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.680
I have heard Aethelhelm
speak of it himself.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.280
I escorted Lord Aelfweard
to find his grandfather.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.920
-Then you are an enemy of the king.
-I know.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.200
And I will accept
what punishments may come.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.520
But the threat from Aethelhelm
seemed too great to ignore.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.200
He is set on war with the king
and the Scots follow him.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.400
And when Christian realms
turn on each other, I fear all is lost.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.440
You should leave here. Protect yourself.
I will report your message.

34:14.239 --> 34:16.600
Lord Aethelhelm, where will we find him?

34:17.080 --> 34:20.560
In a fortress north of here,
name of Bebbanburg.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.159
He is the guest of Lord Wihtgar.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.320
I trust you slept well.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.400
I did not sleep at all.

34:46.080 --> 34:51.480
The howling of the wind can unsettle
those softened to such things.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
Please, eat.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.320
You will find the food
is not what you are used to.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.040
It is the food of my lands.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.320
And what a bounty your lands provide.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.560
Why have you brought me here?

35:06.640 --> 35:10.480
For your protection, child, from the king.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.960
He would never harm me. I am his blood.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.240
He has remarried.
The new queen is with child.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.800
He is creating a new bloodline.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.440
History has proven, time and again,

35:23.520 --> 35:27.360
a new regime wants rid
of remnants of the old.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.360
We are kin. I do not need this protection.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.520
The king has denied you
the throne your mother left you,

35:35.600 --> 35:38.720
murdered the ealdormen to seat himself.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.840
His disregard for you is apparent.

35:41.920 --> 35:45.640
If you were not here, you would surely
already be dead by his hand.

35:46.880 --> 35:50.680
And to secure your protection,
as your mother would have wished,

35:52.320 --> 35:53.720
we have found you a husband.

35:55.280 --> 35:59.080
I am already betrothed
to Cynlaef of Rumcofa.

35:59.160 --> 36:03.120
A boy from Rumcofa?

36:03.680 --> 36:06.720
Hardly a match
for a granddaughter of Alfred.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.200
No, you will marry a king.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.040
Not him!

36:12.880 --> 36:15.920
Too much kinship is bad for a bloodline.

36:17.320 --> 36:21.320
It creates weak men,
and weak men make for weaker kings.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.000
I speak of Constantin of Scotland.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.040
An alliance with him
will leave Saxon lands safe.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.080
I do not wish to be traded like cattle.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.920
I do not see any other purpose for you.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.440
You are not a queen.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.480
You are not a warrior.

36:45.560 --> 36:49.160
You are, by your own admission,
barely a lady.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.800
It is a good marriage,
you should be grateful.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.480
Please, cousin. If you have

36:58.560 --> 37:02.680
-any remaining loyalty to your family--
-It is not I who has been disloyal.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.920
It's my family
who has been disloyal to me.

37:12.360 --> 37:16.240
I will throw myself from the walls
sooner than marry this man.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.520
Then do it!

37:17.600 --> 37:22.400
It will just be one less thing
for me to be concerned with.

37:25.920 --> 37:29.880
I thought so.
Do not make promises you cannot keep.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.160
What is it that you want of me?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.120
Talking to yourself, Uhtred?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.320
Or is this you at prayer?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.600
-I think I'm cursed.
-Then consider me the curse-slayer.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.400
Call me a foolish old priest,
but I sense you are troubled.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.400
Aethelhelm has joined
with the Scots to take Northumbria.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.320
And he's launching his rebellion
from Bebbanburg.

38:27.440 --> 38:31.160
Now, that is a strange twist of fate.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.600
It's not strange at all.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.480
My gods are doing it to taunt me,
to tempt me from my duty to my family.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.760
Why would they do that?

38:43.840 --> 38:45.200
-What've you done?

38:45.280 --> 38:47.160
-Well, that I never understand.
-Mm.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.000
All I know is that for most of my life,

38:49.080 --> 38:52.400
I've given my sword to Wessex
and it drew me away from my family.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.160
Stiorra thinks it was my choice, but…

38:57.280 --> 38:58.640
…I'm not so sure.

39:01.320 --> 39:05.200
Sometimes I think that my fate
is to wander and to never arrive.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.760
You've served the House of Wessex
with much honor.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.000
I've worked hard
for Alfred's ambition, yes.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.920
But my own kin suffered for it.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.720
-Well, it brought you Aethelflaed.
-And then she was taken.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.040
-The gods are cruel.
-Mm.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.040
And now they offer this?

39:23.360 --> 39:28.320
All life is a test, true.
But my god does not want you to fail.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.200
Perhaps there is design in this

39:32.280 --> 39:34.400
-that is benevolent.

39:34.960 --> 39:39.360
Then perhaps you are not meant to choose
between your fate and Alfred's ambition,

39:39.440 --> 39:41.280
between your children and his.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.720
Perhaps you are meant to serve both.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.280
I cannot serve two masters.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
But what if there's only one master?

39:48.920 --> 39:52.920
-One god, one destiny, many branches.
-Yes, yes.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.000
-One tree.
-That is where our beliefs differ.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.040
And this is where I will insist.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.000
Think about it.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.640
You retake Bebbanburg and ensure
Northumbria does not fall to the Scots.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.720
In that act,
you find a home for your bloodline.

40:10.920 --> 40:15.840
You're saying that it is my destiny
to make England for Edward?

40:18.920 --> 40:22.640
That all this wait
for Bebbanburg served a purpose?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.080
-Maybe.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.560
Your god has a sense of humor.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.480
It seems he does.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.800
-And do you want to accept this calling?

40:34.880 --> 40:40.240
Yes, I want to accept, but is it a path
of destiny or… or of arrogance?

40:40.320 --> 40:42.760
Am I being tempted for a fall?

40:42.840 --> 40:48.400
Perhaps the threads my gods have woven,
perhaps they make a net to snare me?

40:48.480 --> 40:52.640
And when I failed the first time,
that was the sign that I ignored.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.960
When Father Beocca was taken--

40:55.040 --> 40:57.560
It was a sign that Beocca
believed in your mission.

40:58.520 --> 41:02.040
-But perhaps you were not ready.
-I felt as ready then as I feel now.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.400
-What if I fail again?
-But what if you don't?

41:06.560 --> 41:09.840
What if you do? If you died
in the doing of it, what would happen?

41:11.360 --> 41:15.120
All reputation lost, all bloodline left
to roam without protection.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.800
The shame would be heavy in Valhalla.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.440
But there is no shame in heaven.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.320
That is the beauty of it.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.320
So my advice would be
believe my god is on your side.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.080
And that you do not walk alone.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.880
-There is no God.
-Mm.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.720
Only the gods.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.800
[Uhtred chuckles softly

41:42.120 --> 41:43.600
Thank you for your kindness.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.760
You could be right.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.920
Maybe they are on my side.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.800
Have you heard from
Lord Aethelhelm?

41:57.880 --> 42:00.040
Has he taken possession
of the Mercian girl?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.200
Last night, I hear.

42:04.720 --> 42:08.920
I'm impressed. I thought perhaps
he'd overplayed his hand.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.640
I still think it is unwise
to trust a man who betrays his king.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.320
True.

42:17.880 --> 42:22.360
But what he offers is sound, so we move
our soldiers closer to the border.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.640
It may take a while.
There have been floods in Cumbraland.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.240
Then we do not alert Edward
to our presence

42:31.320 --> 42:33.840
until all our numbers are gathered.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.760
When we are as one,
we shall face him down.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.320
What if he will not be cowed?

42:41.400 --> 42:44.480
Then he will face a battle he shall lose.

42:45.080 --> 42:49.440
And in the face of defeat,
he will make us a better offer.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.120
What, <i>us</i> being the Scots?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.600
Or <i>us </i>being the alliance
with Lord Aethelhelm?

42:55.680 --> 42:57.760
I will stand by my word.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.920
For as long as is necessary.

43:07.160 --> 43:09.400
We will be ready
to move out by the morning.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.800
-Lord King.
-I have been informed of Benedict's news.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.360
But not of my plan, which will return
Aelfwynn and deliver Aethelhelm.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.400
And as I already told my mother,
this situation requires restraint.

43:18.480 --> 43:23.240
-We are returning to Wessex.
-Listen to me. I know how to end this.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.640
There is no ending to this
that is satisfactory.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.800
Aethelhelm will be expecting me to lead
an army into battle, it is surely a trap.

43:30.880 --> 43:32.880
I know, but we have the advantage.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.880
Father Benedict told us of their plan.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.600
We have a moment to strike
whilst they're unprepared.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.480
-It would be foolish not to use it.
-I can assure you I am not foolish.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.920
Only unwilling to behave
as my enemies dictate.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.560
So we divide those enemies.
We leave immediately,

43:47.640 --> 43:50.440
we cut off Constantin
before he even reaches Bebbanburg.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.960
If I can intercept him
and stop the incursion, then--

43:53.040 --> 43:55.440
Aethelhelm would be without allies
at Bebbanburg.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.760
He may control the household guard,
but they'd be no match

43:57.840 --> 44:00.800
for the Mercian army. It would not
be easy to breach the fortress.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.360
But it is possible
if we're our full number.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.360
I lead the men of Wessex and we push
the Scots back over the border.

44:06.440 --> 44:09.200
Meanwhile, Aethelhelm will be forced
to surrender and Aelfwynn returned.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.080
But what will stop Constantin from making
another incursion in years to come?

44:13.640 --> 44:16.920
You fortify the lands north of Bebbanburg
and I hold them for you.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.480
Uhtred, Lord of Bebbanburg,
just as you always wanted.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.240
-And you hold it alone?
-Not alone.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.280
I take it you're not heading
to Rumcofa after all, Lord.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.280
We heard from Lady Aelswith that there may
be something you might need our help with.

44:37.360 --> 44:42.280
You have found the men I sought to return
Aelfwynn when you refused, I see?

44:42.360 --> 44:44.520
Yes,
thank you very much for this.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.760
So, then, when you are dead,
who holds the north after you?

44:50.240 --> 44:52.800
Your seedless son,
or a child of Stiorra the Dane?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.040
I cannot speak for my daughter.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.120
No, you cannot.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.160
Uhtred's plan has much to commend it,

45:00.240 --> 45:02.280
but still this is not
the correct course of action.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.080
You're going to allow the marriage
to take place? Edward!

45:05.160 --> 45:08.760
I'm going to make Constantin an offer
in exchange for Aethelhelm's head.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
He is the greater threat to our kingdom.

45:13.160 --> 45:16.520
Northumbria is a land much disputed
between us and the Scots.

45:16.600 --> 45:20.800
Until a settlement is made, there will be
no peace and those that will suffer

45:20.880 --> 45:23.680
are not those in this room,
but farmers, fishermen, families.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.160
I am a king for all Saxons,
not king to one man.

45:27.240 --> 45:30.000
And though I owe that man a debt,
I cannot put that debt

45:30.080 --> 45:32.720
nor that man's ambition
above the lives of my people.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.240
Constantin's reputation
is that of a man who seeks

45:38.320 --> 45:40.840
to protect Scotland at all costs,
above all else.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.600
So, I will come to an agreement with him.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.440
In exchange for marrying Aelfwynn
and isolating Lord Aethelhelm,

45:50.040 --> 45:51.840
we will divide Northumbria in two,

45:51.920 --> 45:54.880
to create an area of fortification
around the Scottish border.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.760
You would split Northumbria!

45:58.080 --> 46:00.960
These are lands my forebears died for.
Saxon lands!

46:01.040 --> 46:03.240
Now, finally, you're a Saxon?

46:03.320 --> 46:05.040
The people there speak your language.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.720
They were once two kingdoms.
It has been thus before.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.400
The lands around Bebbanburg
fall to the Scots

46:11.480 --> 46:13.280
and Aethelhelm is disposed of.

46:13.360 --> 46:17.400
-With Aelfwynn sacrificed alongside him?
-Not a palatable choice, but sensible.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.920
If Northumbria is divided,

46:19.000 --> 46:22.320
you forfeit any chance to create
the kingdom your father hoped for.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.360
Yes, but in return, I will bring peace

46:24.440 --> 46:27.600
to a land larger and more unified
than he ever achieved.

46:28.840 --> 46:32.120
I have ended the tyranny
of bloody succession the people endured.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.800
Now they thrive
under the protection of a man,

46:34.880 --> 46:36.920
who does not take their deaths lightly.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.440
-Lord King, your choice has no honor.
-No honor?

46:41.040 --> 46:45.400
To forego my chance to unify all
of these lands for the sake of my people?

46:46.160 --> 46:50.880
To put aside my father's dream, the dream
of my family, to ensure that we prosper?

46:50.960 --> 46:52.840
That is not honor. That is martyrdom.

46:52.920 --> 46:56.320
If the people wish to reward me
in their prayers, that is their will.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.640
My father's ambition failed them
in the end. I do not have his failings.

47:00.720 --> 47:04.880
-It was not ambition, it was vision.
-Visions are nothing more than dreams.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.440
Only a fool would chase them.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.400
I think that you are afraid.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.280
Of war, of death.

47:13.080 --> 47:13.920
You're afraid.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.880
Only a fool would not be.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.960
And I am not a fool.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.840
No.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.200
Lord King, this is callous,

47:33.280 --> 47:36.240
to Aelfwynn and to all those
in Northumbria who are Saxon.

47:36.320 --> 47:38.400
Mercia owes both a debt of loyalty.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.800
Mercia is best served
when the south is secure.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.800
Not at the expense of the north.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.240
Aethelflaed would listen to Uhtred now.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.680
As must we.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.440
And I gave your sister my word
that I would keep Aelfwynn safe.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.520
I will not sacrifice her as you do now!

47:59.320 --> 48:01.040
And nor will the Mercian army.

48:12.520 --> 48:15.480
-I stand with Uhtred.
-Well, there we have it.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.720
Not only Lord Aethelhelm
who seeks to rebel.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.680
With respect, Lord King…

48:24.440 --> 48:27.240
it is not only Lord Aldhelm
who believes you to be wrong.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.200
There are good people in Northumbria.
They are your people.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.360
You owe them your protection.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.320
We stand with Uhtred.

48:41.400 --> 48:44.000
It is not
that you are wrong, my son.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.520
It is that you are simply mistaken
on this occasion.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.720
Whilst your arguments are considered...

48:52.480 --> 48:56.480
I would urge you to follow
the counsel of Lord Uhtred.

48:57.400 --> 49:01.960
Your father trusted his judgment,
as should you.

49:33.280 --> 49:37.400
Aethelstan, my boy,
what do you say?

49:38.840 --> 49:42.280
Should we take a fight to the Scots,
risking decades of conflict,

49:42.840 --> 49:48.000
or seek a solution that profits both sides
yet denies Uhtred his ancestral home?

49:48.080 --> 49:51.320
-You do not have to answer, Aethelstan.
-And yet he should.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.440
Since Aelfweard
has shown himself disloyal...

49:56.200 --> 49:58.840
Aethelstan could be the king
to face the Scots.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.360
What do you say, Aethelstan?

50:18.600 --> 50:20.960
Our faith teaches us to speak the truth.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.120
It teaches us to seek peace.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.080
And that all Christians must unite.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.080
To abandon those in your kingdom…

50:43.200 --> 50:44.520
divide their lands...

50:46.400 --> 50:47.480
that is not unity.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.040
I will follow Lord Uhtred.

51:03.720 --> 51:07.680
Not sure things are going your way,
Lord King.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.720
As I told you, Uhtred,
you do not walk alone.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.360
We gather an army...

51:16.440 --> 51:19.280
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:22.280 --> 51:24.240
I will brook no more defiance.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.960
I am a just king,
but think on those who I have crushed.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.680
Think on the ealdormen.
Think of Sigtryggr.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.640
The gates will be closed to all.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.160
No one will leave on penalty of execution.

51:49.760 --> 51:52.920
Then the Mercian Guard will be ordered
to ram the gate down.

51:53.400 --> 51:56.320
You can try to fight us, Lord King,
but we will fight back.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.520
You delay and we lose the advantage.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.960
So, you can join our mission
or you can flounder here.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.240
But we will be gone by sunrise.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.160
Choose!
