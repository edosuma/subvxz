00:52.596 --> 00:55.780
Mrs Tuttle expecting you, gentlemen.
She's in the library.

02:32.699 --> 02:35.820
- You got that Mr. Salisbury?
- Yes Ms Tuttle.

02:35.821 --> 02:36.921
New paragraph.

02:37.498 --> 02:42.597
The entire block in downtown Kansas City
between the streets mentioned previously

02:42.632 --> 02:45.051
to be cleared of all existing structures

02:45.052 --> 02:49.990
and the erection of the
25th Tuttle Department Store...

02:50.093 --> 02:56.718
to begin not later than...
Oh, not later than June the 1st.

02:56.919 --> 02:59.311
That will be all, Mr. Salisbury.

02:59.691 --> 03:01.690
Come in, gentlemen.

03:10.189 --> 03:13.588
Your daughter, Barbara,
evidently met Norman Phiffier

03:13.589 --> 03:17.188
during the first week in January.
We cannot ascertain the exact date.

03:17.687 --> 03:21.160
January, that's when she left home.
Go on, go on...

03:21.186 --> 03:24.085
- I want to know all about him.
- Mr. Phiffier is 26.

03:24.185 --> 03:28.184
He was born in Weehawken, New Jersey.
- Weehawken?

03:28.219 --> 03:31.683
Mr. Phiffier lost his parents early.
No other family.

03:32.182 --> 03:34.882
Public school education to the fifth grade.

03:34.917 --> 03:38.145
And Barbara was educated at Wellesley.
Graduated with honors.

03:38.180 --> 03:43.679
What can they possibly have in common?
Continue Mr. Orlandos!

03:44.180 --> 03:47.428
Mr. Phiffier has worked as
a delivery boy at Macys,

03:47.463 --> 03:50.677
theater usher at the New York Paramount,

03:50.678 --> 03:53.477
caddy at the Larchmont country club,

03:53.512 --> 03:56.376
a TV repairman in the Bronx.

03:56.475 --> 04:00.774
And Mr Phiffier also attempted to
become a mailman, but failed the test.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.639
How can anyone fail becoming a mailman?

04:03.674 --> 04:07.672
Sloping shoulders,
the bag kept slipping off.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.637
Mr. Phiffier has also tried
other means of employment,

04:10.672 --> 04:14.136
- not all listed here.
- Never mind the details.

04:14.171 --> 04:19.619
Apparently he can't hold a job.
What is he doing now?

04:19.754 --> 04:24.967
Mr Phiffier is at present employed as
a poodle dog walker and animal sitter.

04:25.268 --> 04:27.631
I'm not sure I heard you.

04:27.666 --> 04:33.164
I said Mr Phiffier is at present employed
as a poodle dog walker and animal sitter.

04:33.165 --> 04:37.664
Now I'm sure I heard you.
Will you kindly tell me what that means.

04:38.164 --> 04:40.953
Well as a poodle dog
walker, Mr Phiffier walks

04:40.965 --> 04:43.527
poodle dogs... for busy
poodle dog owners.

04:43.562 --> 04:46.765
And as an animal sitter he...
sits with animals

04:46.777 --> 04:49.389
as a baby sitter who
sits with a baby.

04:49.424 --> 04:54.861
Invariably the creature he sits with are
neurotic cats or paranoid parakeets.

04:55.159 --> 04:59.158
- Are you ready with the film?
- Yes, Mr Orlandos.

04:59.159 --> 05:04.157
A slope shouldered Weehawken born
animal sitter and poodle dog walker...

05:04.192 --> 05:07.121
I just can't wait to see him!

05:07.156 --> 05:11.154
Mrs Tuttle, this first reel of film
was taken with our hidden camera

05:11.189 --> 05:14.871
after certain financial
arrangements have been completed

05:14.906 --> 05:19.253
with the owner of the lunch counter
where Mr Phiffier has his noon hour repas.

05:33.648 --> 05:35.926
You must be joking!

05:35.927 --> 05:39.880
I wish I were Mrs Tuttle,
but alas that is Norman Phiffier.

05:45.246 --> 05:47.645
My daughter cannot be in love with...

05:47.680 --> 05:51.644
She can't be that ill!

06:01.041 --> 06:06.640
He's a human disposal!
All that's missing is a switch.

06:16.538 --> 06:19.637
And at least he washes.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.600
He does have lovely manners.

06:38.801 --> 06:43.358
Now this next scene, Mrs Tuttle...
show Mr Phiffier his present occupation.

06:43.428 --> 06:47.296
Fifi! Easy!
Marcelo, Marcelo slow down!

06:47.331 --> 06:49.519
Versailles!

06:49.554 --> 06:52.098
Here Tonya... stay away from Murray!

06:52.353 --> 06:54.504
Easy... there's a tree!

06:54.505 --> 06:57.731
Hey! There's a tree.

06:57.732 --> 07:00.223
A fine sense of coordination.

07:00.258 --> 07:02.430
Listen, there's a tree!

07:05.078 --> 07:07.030
Marvelous!
That must be the end of him.

07:07.031 --> 07:10.316
Not quite Mrs Tuttle. He landed in
another tree across the street.

07:10.351 --> 07:13.642
But he was well enough to take your
daughter to a  motion picture that evening.

07:13.677 --> 07:17.478
These next films were also
photographs by our secret camera

07:17.479 --> 07:21.018
as he walked your daughter
Barbara back to her apartment.

07:22.374 --> 07:27.673
Now would yo look where she chooses
to live, when she could be living here!

07:30.671 --> 07:33.170
Oh, no!

07:36.269 --> 07:37.938
Barbara stop it!

07:50.184 --> 07:55.095
- Oh, I've seen enough!
- But we have five more reels, Mrs. Tuttle.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.100
Well, leave them here!
I'll burn them.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.262
I'd rather know I never saw
my daughter’s temporary insanity.

08:01.332 --> 08:06.531
You bring up a child, gives her the
best of everything money can buy...

08:06.566 --> 08:08.629
and she meets a thing like that!

08:09.530 --> 08:14.494
Falls in love, moves out of this
into some run down brown stone...

08:14.529 --> 08:18.028
changes her name so that no
one will know she is an heiress...

08:18.427 --> 08:23.026
work incognito in one of my stores, one of
the stores she will eventually inherit...

08:23.528 --> 08:27.027
- If I may make a suggestion Mrs Tuttle?
- Yes.

08:27.526 --> 08:29.987
We have ascertained that
Mr Phiffier, in spite

08:29.999 --> 08:31.989
of his multitude in
the shortcomings

08:32.024 --> 08:36.023
is a proud young man bent on
making his own way in the world.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.320
A word to him that Barbara is wealthy,

08:38.321 --> 08:40.688
and not the poor working girl
he believes her to be...

08:40.722 --> 08:44.020
his pride would make him
end the relationship!

08:44.020 --> 08:47.127
My daughter and I are far apart as it is.

08:47.721 --> 08:49.948
If I ever openly interfered in this...

08:49.949 --> 08:52.421
romance, she'll never forgive me.
I'll never get her back.

08:53.054 --> 08:59.517
There has to be another way!
She's weak minded... just like her father.

09:01.516 --> 09:08.514
I'm going to the office, dear.
Oh oh! Excuse me, I didn't know you...

09:08.813 --> 09:15.512
- Yes, dear. You're going to the office.
- Yes, thank you, dear. Thank you.

09:19.211 --> 09:24.956
Oh! Just like her father!
That will be all Mr Orlandos.

09:25.010 --> 09:27.833
<i>You mean there will be no
further need of our services?</i>

09:28.234 --> 09:32.184
I think not.
I like to have a listen myself.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.502
Going up!

09:51.002 --> 09:54.501
- Good morning, Mr. Tuttle!
- Good morning, Miss Fuller!

09:54.536 --> 09:55.901
Close please!

09:56.002 --> 09:58.801
- Ladies lingerie?
- Fourth floor.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.498
- Panties, bras, girdles.
- I need all of them.

10:08.497 --> 10:12.496
Panties, bras, girdles?
My... how professional we're getting.

10:12.531 --> 10:15.751
- How are you, father?
- How are you, Miss Fuller?

10:15.996 --> 10:17.960
Miss Fuller is just fine.

10:17.995 --> 10:20.503
I understand, but don't tell
your mother I understand.

10:20.504 --> 10:22.022
How is mother?

10:22.057 --> 10:25.457
Please. You'll put me off my game. Let's
talk about something pleasant, like...

10:25.492 --> 10:29.081
- How is your secret romance?
- Oh, it's just wonderful.

10:29.091 --> 10:32.490
- It must be. You look radiant.
- Why shouldn't I be?

10:32.491 --> 10:35.490
I finally found someone
who loves me for me.

10:35.525 --> 10:38.489
Not that I'm a Tuttle heiress,
but me the elevator girl.

10:38.524 --> 10:39.787
When will I get to meet him?

10:39.788 --> 10:42.471
I'll introduce him to you
after we're married,

10:42.506 --> 10:45.452
and it's too late for him to get
away from me and my inheritance.

10:45.487 --> 10:46.732
Why? Doesn't he like money?

10:46.733 --> 10:49.865
Of course.
But only if he earned it himself.

10:50.421 --> 10:55.450
Oh dad. He's the first real
honest boy I've ever met.

10:55.485 --> 10:58.484
Well, as your mother always says,
you have to made your choice.

10:58.519 --> 11:02.982
Either be rich or honest.
Good for him!

11:06.981 --> 11:11.444
Nurse, this patient is suffering
from a ruptured spleen,

11:11.479 --> 11:15.778
a dislocated kidney, and his
eyes are bloodshot.

11:16.478 --> 11:21.477
Right after this operation, Bosley.
It's bedtime for you. Don't forget.

11:21.977 --> 11:24.976
Scalpel.

11:29.975 --> 11:32.974
Did you forget the anesthesia?

11:33.474 --> 11:36.576
Don't worry about it, Bosley.
TV actors never die.

11:36.659 --> 11:40.592
Well in this case anyhow. Because he is a
TV doctor. And he has to be on next week.

11:40.627 --> 11:44.557
Patients die. They can't
do that with the doctors.

11:44.592 --> 11:49.056
Don't be concerned about them now.
Just don't worry about it.

11:49.556 --> 11:55.550
Old Ben will take care of 'em.
That's Ben you know, behind that mask.

11:55.555 --> 11:57.120
He isn't even smiling.

12:01.052 --> 12:04.116
Hell, we've gone this far.
Just hold on.

12:04.151 --> 12:07.850
I don't know how see television,
anyhow. Through all that hair.

12:08.051 --> 12:12.215
Give a look and maybe you'll see something.
You'll stop eating. Here... take a peek.

12:12.250 --> 12:18.549
And now, some scenes from next week's show.
"The Case of the Missing Kidney".

12:22.247 --> 12:26.132
Ok Bosley. That's it. It's beddie
time. Come on! We're going to bed.

12:27.103 --> 12:29.062
Here we go sweetheart.
Swing 'em. Come on.

12:29.133 --> 12:33.385
No! You're tired, now there's no point
in walking. Come on sweetheart! Here we go.

12:35.043 --> 12:37.116
Wait Bosley! Bosley!

12:38.542 --> 12:40.629
Bosley, here we go!
Come on baby.

12:43.641 --> 12:50.040
Oh, not to me, Bosley. I love you.
Here, look don't growl. Look how good?

12:50.940 --> 12:55.243
Here see? He growled...
Come, Bosley! Let's go.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.734
<i>Tuttle Department Store.</i>

13:06.735 --> 13:08.351
Mr. Quimby's office, please.

13:11.568 --> 13:15.497
- Quimby here!
- You're out of breath, Quimby.

13:15.532 --> 13:19.032
Yes. I... I'm working late.
Long day.

13:19.067 --> 13:22.556
Oh don't put me on Quimby.
You've had at least three Scotches...

13:22.591 --> 13:26.030
and you're winded from
chasing your pretty secretary.

13:26.065 --> 13:29.028
But no worry, Quimby.
I'll okay a next raise.

13:29.228 --> 13:34.527
I've always considered you not only
my boss, but a dandy friend Mrs Tuttle.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.113
<i>How's my daughter doing?</i>

13:36.114 --> 13:39.474
Barbara? Oh she's doing fine.
Makes smooth stops.

13:39.509 --> 13:42.089
Barbara is not doing fine!

13:42.124 --> 13:43.823
Barbara is in love with an imbecile!

13:43.924 --> 13:46.417
Oh! Not Barbara!
She's too intelligent.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.922
Well, look what I married!

13:48.023 --> 13:50.023
- Yes, Mrs. Tuttle.
- Now listen, Quimby.

13:50.522 --> 13:53.986
I want you to hire this booblay of hers...

13:54.221 --> 13:58.020
<i>I want him to work at the store so that
they'll be thrown together every day.</i>

13:58.021 --> 14:03.519
I want you to give this nut
every impossible dirty job there is.

14:03.554 --> 14:05.539
<i>I know you've trouble holding jobs.</i>

14:05.618 --> 14:08.582
<i>We make it tough
enough on him, he'll quit.</i>

14:08.717 --> 14:11.859
And Barbara will see for herself
that he is not the man for her.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.998
You understand, Quimby?

14:14.015 --> 14:16.193
Yes, Mrs Tuttle.
I like the way you think.

14:16.515 --> 14:22.514
- Now go back to your honeypot.
- Yes... I mean, no, no Mrs. Tuttle.

14:24.613 --> 14:29.512
- Am I disturbing you dear?
- Oh come in, darling.

14:32.011 --> 14:36.510
Come and tell me all about
your day at the office. Hmmm.

14:37.009 --> 14:42.008
Well dear, I did manage to make a few
putts I was rather proud of, you know.

14:46.506 --> 14:50.754
You know dear, I think if I had a...
sort of a green rug on my office floor,

14:50.755 --> 14:52.823
I...I might even do better.

14:53.005 --> 14:55.408
You know it might give
me the impression I

14:55.420 --> 14:58.004
was... right out there
on a real golf course.

14:58.503 --> 15:03.501
Now I'll have Quimby install one
tomorrow. They're on sale.

15:03.502 --> 15:10.500
- Blue grass green.
- Blue grass green? Oh that's nice.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.499
In bed, wait.
It Beddie bye bye!

15:18.497 --> 15:22.497
Bosley don't fight it!
You have to get your rest!

15:22.497 --> 15:26.496
You're almost a year old.
Don't you want to grow?

15:26.497 --> 15:32.495
Bosley! Don't fight it.
You have to sleep a few hours, then we...

15:33.494 --> 15:35.420
Good.
Your mommy and daddy home.

15:35.993 --> 15:38.720
Hi Norman!
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

15:38.793 --> 15:42.146
Yeah, some work. Putting puppy to sleep.
Some work. Come on in.

15:42.181 --> 15:43.844
I've got good news!

15:43.891 --> 15:46.888
The only good news is I'll never save up
enough money for us to get married.

15:46.889 --> 15:47.963
That's the only good news.

15:48.090 --> 15:52.455
No! You can start working
at Tuttle's tomorrow.

15:52.490 --> 15:56.300
- T...Tuttles where you work?
- Yes! I was talking to Mr Quimby.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.987
- What's a Quimby?
- Norman, don't get so excited.

15:58.988 --> 16:03.117
Well, I am excited! I'll see you every day
where you work. And I... What's Quimby...

16:03.285 --> 16:05.985
Mr. Quimby is the manager
of Tuttle's department store.

16:06.285 --> 16:08.584
And tonight, coming
down in the elevator...

16:08.619 --> 16:11.583
he was telling me how impossible
it is to find bright young men

16:11.683 --> 16:13.582
for those important jobs at the store.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.683
Yeah. And you... bright young...
And you told him about me?

16:16.782 --> 16:18.946
Yes. Now I told him
you were just a friend

16:19.081 --> 16:21.750
because they don't approve
of employee romances.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.979
Remember you're just my friend
and he wants to see you tomorrow.

16:25.014 --> 16:27.479
Yeah, okay. I'll remember.
I'm just a friend.

16:27.678 --> 16:29.752
Yeah, but friends don't kiss,
so... I'll take that back.

16:29.778 --> 16:32.777
Tomorrow I go into the store
and I start right in.

16:32.778 --> 16:33.596
The first thing I'm going to do...

16:33.597 --> 16:36.570
I'm gonna wash in the morning. Because
it is better that you have it clean.

16:36.605 --> 16:39.205
And then I'll wear my new suit,
the one that's pressed stiff...

16:39.206 --> 16:41.033
You'd walk like that,
which is like a regiment.

16:41.075 --> 16:45.625
That's the... then I'll walk in, I'll stay
like cool, I won't be... you know excited.

16:45.660 --> 16:48.029
I'll just walk in and have
a heart attack and faint.

16:48.072 --> 16:50.971
- You think I'll do good. I...?
- Of course you will!

16:51.273 --> 16:54.472
You just need an opportunity.
You've never had one.

16:54.873 --> 16:55.678
Right.

16:55.713 --> 16:57.371
Getting a job! Wow...!

16:57.472 --> 16:58.772
We can save money.

16:58.971 --> 17:03.871
We can... I can... You no save.
I save... I save money!

17:03.906 --> 17:05.968
And then, I'll buy the engagement ring.

17:06.002 --> 17:07.739
And then we can get married soon.

17:07.867 --> 17:10.266
Yeah. That's it.
And then you quit your job

17:10.267 --> 17:14.465
and then I can babysit for our children,
instead of cats and parakeets and dogs like

17:14.501 --> 17:18.467
Bosley there.
Bosley! Bosley!

17:20.064 --> 17:22.767
Bosley, come back here!
You wait here!

17:22.768 --> 17:24.730
No! I'm coming with you!
We do everything together.

17:24.765 --> 17:25.832
Alright!
Hurry up.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.364
Oh darling, are you hurt?

17:41.738 --> 17:44.714
Yeah, but it's a good hurt.
Because of you.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.573
Oh, darling...

17:46.574 --> 17:49.346
I can't believe it.
You're so beautiful and...

17:49.756 --> 17:50.956
And what?

17:51.056 --> 17:54.054
Well, you're the first person
I ever met that I really trust.

17:55.956 --> 18:00.458
Darling!
Just remember that I love you.

18:00.755 --> 18:03.155
Love and trust.
They're the same thing.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.279
Mr. Phiffier is here.

18:35.344 --> 18:36.144
Who?

18:36.145 --> 18:37.373
Mr. Phiffier.

18:37.642 --> 18:42.368
Oh yes, yes! Bring him in!
You may have to take notes.

18:46.940 --> 18:48.906
Mr Phiffier.
Mr Quimby.

18:49.424 --> 18:52.338
How do you do, Mr. Quimby.
I'm very glad.

18:52.438 --> 18:55.239
Mr. Phiffier, sit down.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.339
Yes, thank you.

19:02.437 --> 19:06.336
Well, Mr Phiffier. You certainly
come highly recommended.

19:06.371 --> 19:08.792
Highly. Indeed highly.

19:08.827 --> 19:11.433
Oh you must be referring
to Ms Barbara Fuller.

19:11.468 --> 19:16.432
Well, she may very well be biased on me.
Uh that is... somewhat biased.

19:16.467 --> 19:17.730
Oh! We're friends.

19:17.831 --> 19:20.218
You're modest, Mr Phiffier.
Well, that's good.

19:20.253 --> 19:23.390
We need modest and
intelligent young men.

19:23.391 --> 19:26.661
Men to learn the mercantile
business, from the ground up.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.929
Oh you mean I start from the first floor?

19:28.964 --> 19:33.471
Funny. Funny.
Funny. Droll.

19:34.427 --> 19:37.926
Miss Fuller also spoke in glowing
terms regarding your honesty.

19:38.161 --> 19:40.824
Oh yes, I believe that
honesty is the best...

19:40.925 --> 19:44.889
Policy! Right, my boy!
Right.

19:44.924 --> 19:48.988
How do you suppose I got to be the
General Manager of this great store? How?

19:49.457 --> 19:51.305
- How? How?
- I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.767
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- I will. I will.

19:55.422 --> 19:58.477
By being honest, boy.
That's how.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.884
- Excuse me.
- Why? Do you have a cold?

20:01.919 --> 20:04.418
Yes. I did get it while
working late last night.

20:05.918 --> 20:08.712
We all worked late
around here, Mr Feeffier.

20:09.118 --> 20:10.737
No, that's a Phiffier.

20:10.917 --> 20:13.779
Well, we all work late
around here, Mr. Phiffier.

20:13.814 --> 20:18.697
We are all vitally interested in our work.
We all want to get to the top.

20:19.014 --> 20:23.413
And in this organization
there is a room at the top!

20:23.348 --> 20:25.813
Yeah, well I'll have no trouble
with that going to the top

20:25.814 --> 20:28.713
because nose bleed don't bother me.

20:28.814 --> 20:30.826
And you will be rewarded, boy.

20:30.961 --> 20:31.869
You will get raises.

20:31.870 --> 20:35.023
Ask Shirley, my secretary,
how many raises she has received.

20:35.106 --> 20:37.410
That's right, lots of raises.

20:37.445 --> 20:41.408
- That was from doing your job good?
- That's right.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.208
And you too will do good work.

20:44.307 --> 20:47.406
But first you must get
the feel of this great store.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.706
I'll have no trouble with that.
I have very sensitive fingertips.

20:50.905 --> 20:54.504
You must get to know every nook
and cranny of this great store.

20:54.505 --> 20:56.933
Oh I'm very good in
nookying and crannying.

20:57.903 --> 21:00.910
So you agree to start your
great climb to success?

21:01.104 --> 21:04.899
- Your climb to the very top!
- I'm ready to climb!

21:04.938 --> 21:06.295
By starting at the very bottom.

21:06.401 --> 21:11.665
Right down below the depths of the bottom
deep lowest place where I am I'll start.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.536
You will do the jobs I assign to you
and I will watch every move you make.

21:15.537 --> 21:17.020
- Right!
- Right!

21:17.027 --> 21:17.898
Whatever you say!

21:18.398 --> 21:20.235
Here's a list of things
I've lined up for you to do.

21:20.396 --> 21:24.245
Now hop to the top, tackle the task,
move that mountain, love that labour.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.395
See the personnel manager on the 9th
floor, and welcome aboard my boy!

21:28.895 --> 21:33.417
- Thank you, Mr Quimble!
- No no no! It's Quimby, Mr. Feeffier.

21:33.452 --> 21:36.592
No! Phiffier, Mr. Quimble.
Oh I... I'm...

21:37.393 --> 21:41.255
If I get married and I get a little kid
the birth name it will be yours...

21:41.256 --> 21:42.823
little Quimby Phiffier.

21:42.891 --> 21:46.840
- Well what if it's a girl?
- We'll name it Ms Quimby Phi... No.

21:46.875 --> 21:50.287
Thank you very much. When we have
a baby we'll name it after you Shirley.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.647
Oh gung ho.

22:07.385 --> 22:09.552
Excuse me, Mr Quimby
told me to come down...

22:09.553 --> 22:10.767
Oh please wait inside.

22:10.983 --> 22:13.882
Oh yes.
Thank you.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.305
Mr. Quimby's office!

24:46.340 --> 24:49.339
Oh Mrs. Tuttle. Yes.
Just a minute please.

24:50.839 --> 24:54.338
- Yeah. What do you want?
- Mrs Tuttle on one.

24:54.838 --> 24:56.980
- Yes Mrs Tuttle.
- Have you met him?

24:56.981 --> 24:58.746
Yes I did.
An hour ago.

24:58.781 --> 25:00.801
What job did you give him to do?

25:00.836 --> 25:05.335
I gave him a long list of
choice, impossible, dirty jobs.

25:05.336 --> 25:07.135
He must be starting the first one now.

25:07.236 --> 25:08.336
What is it?

25:08.338 --> 25:11.637
He's going to to paint the knob
on the end of our flagpole.

25:11.838 --> 25:15.496
The flagpole extending
from the 9th floor?

25:15.531 --> 25:17.024
Exactly, Mrs Tuttle.

25:17.434 --> 25:22.984
Mr. Quimby, I like the way you think.

25:23.233 --> 25:26.402
You can see him from
your window can't you?

25:26.433 --> 25:27.655
Hang on.

25:50.226 --> 25:52.226
Well...

26:08.321 --> 26:10.720
He's crawling out on the flagpole!

26:10.921 --> 26:14.238
Well don't hang up!
Tell me every move!

26:14.539 --> 26:17.120
You... stinker you.

26:37.714 --> 26:38.913
He slipped!

26:39.414 --> 26:40.246
Did he fall?

26:40.415 --> 26:42.421
He's... But he's...
But he's hanging on.

26:44.711 --> 26:47.668
He's hanging on...

26:54.108 --> 26:55.877
He's going back into the window.

26:57.208 --> 26:59.257
He's disappeared.

26:59.292 --> 27:02.109
Where has he gone?
Oh well, maybe he's quit.

27:02.207 --> 27:04.276
Maybe he's gone!
I would have get rid of him already.

27:04.677 --> 27:07.154
No! No wait.
Wait! He's coming back.

27:08.904 --> 27:12.703
He's at the window again.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.963
What is he doing?

27:29.098 --> 27:33.698
Oh he's smarter than
we thought, Mrs. Tuttle.

27:35.697 --> 27:40.661
What do you mean?
Come tell me! Speak up!

27:40.696 --> 27:43.652
Why do you mean he's
smarter than we thought?

27:45.195 --> 27:50.194
Just what I said, Mrs Tuttle.
Just what I said...

28:08.188 --> 28:11.152
- I beg your pardon. I...
- Yes?

28:11.187 --> 28:14.661
Well your secretary isn't here,
so I thought I'd barge right in.

28:14.662 --> 28:17.188
Well, I have no secretary.
Come right in young man.

28:17.223 --> 28:19.684
Well thanks.
I was painting this...

28:19.719 --> 28:23.563
I... was painting the flagpole, you know.

28:23.684 --> 28:27.147
And I couldn't get underneath from
above, so I thought I'd come through...

28:27.182 --> 28:28.620
and use your window, if you don't mind.

28:28.621 --> 28:33.016
Thank you. Because I have a few little
itsy bitsy touches to get yet... and I...

28:33.181 --> 28:37.911
thought I could... get it
from here... I think.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.837
There's a spot right...

28:45.179 --> 28:46.779
Hey, that's extraordinary!

28:47.177 --> 28:49.081
Goodness!
Well you're doing a good job.

28:49.082 --> 28:51.757
Yeah if I get one little
fleck there... spot.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.176
Yeah I see it.

28:53.374 --> 28:56.372
Yeah! I got it!
Well that's it. Finire.

28:56.374 --> 29:00.873
That's very clever. Making a long
brush handle out of a fishing pole.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.374
Thank you very much.

29:02.575 --> 29:07.073
Most man would have been stupid enough
to crawl out there on that pole to do that.

29:07.172 --> 29:12.463
I don't believe anyone be that
stupid to go out on a flagpole...

29:12.498 --> 29:14.269
I mean...
How could anyone be so stupid?

29:14.370 --> 29:16.870
Well, conditioning would do it.
Take me for instance.

29:17.069 --> 29:18.845
I'd have been stupid
enough to have done it.

29:18.846 --> 29:20.841
Oh no!
I don't think so.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.068
You look like a very intelligent man.

29:23.167 --> 29:28.165
You look... like that...
man on the wall.

29:28.665 --> 29:33.130
You look just like this... that's you
John P. Tuttle, president of the...

29:33.165 --> 29:38.347
- Yes, that's me, old J.P., President.
- Oh I'm very sorry Mr President.

29:38.382 --> 29:42.185
I'm very sorry. I know you're very busy.
It was very nice to have met you.

29:42.220 --> 29:43.684
No! No no. I'm not busy.

29:43.685 --> 29:47.187
Well your brain must be very
busy to be a president with a...

29:50.996 --> 29:53.658
Just like an IBM machine.
How else you get to be president?

29:54.658 --> 29:56.556
You're new around here, aren't you?

29:56.591 --> 29:58.731
Yes sir. My very first day at Tuttles.

29:58.766 --> 30:01.014
Yeah that's right. Otherwise
you would have known about me.

30:01.015 --> 30:04.827
Oh! Well I know you're Mr President...
and you have a lovely office and...

30:05.362 --> 30:07.260
But you don't look very happy.

30:07.295 --> 30:13.297
You know, I think that you ought to
know the facts about me first hand

30:13.332 --> 30:16.218
without getting them from
rumors at the coffee break.

30:16.553 --> 30:22.402
Now there I am, J.P. Tuttle,
President from 1941 to...

30:22.486 --> 30:25.349
whenever I shuffle off this mortal coil.

30:25.350 --> 30:26.750
Oh! Don't say that.

30:27.149 --> 30:29.148
Nice people should never shuttle off...

30:29.183 --> 30:31.947
We don't have a nice people enough
to go around now yet a bunch...

30:32.048 --> 30:32.548
Well thank you.

30:33.148 --> 30:38.446
And that's P.P. Tuttle.
He was President from 1900 to 1941.

30:38.481 --> 30:39.884
That's a very long job.

30:39.947 --> 30:42.146
And that's Z.P. Tuttle.

30:42.245 --> 30:46.088
He was President from 1860 to 1900.

30:46.123 --> 30:47.109
Oh that's when he got a job...

30:47.144 --> 30:51.143
The rest of these fellows date back
from 1799, when the firm was started.

30:51.343 --> 30:53.495
But you don't look anything
like the rest of them...

30:53.496 --> 30:54.771
Here! Let me show you.

30:54.772 --> 30:55.959
Yes, I would like to see...

31:00.740 --> 31:02.325
It's witchcraft!

31:02.826 --> 31:04.843
That's terrific, the way you...

31:05.140 --> 31:08.639
These are the real presidents.
They are all related.

31:08.674 --> 31:11.602
Myself and the other men
were just the husbands.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.187
We weren't even named Tuttle.

31:13.188 --> 31:15.183
We changed our names
when we married them.

31:15.218 --> 31:16.345
The Tuttle women.

31:17.935 --> 31:21.134
So they were the bosses, huh?

31:22.134 --> 31:24.233
You mean to tell me she bosses you?

31:24.434 --> 31:26.034
She's got the money, son.

31:26.133 --> 31:28.524
Whoever has the
money is always in charge.

31:28.825 --> 31:30.732
Never marry a rich woman.

31:31.130 --> 31:32.243
Oh I don't plan to.

31:32.244 --> 31:34.651
The woman I'm going to marry
is going to be plain and poor.

31:34.665 --> 31:37.330
And all she's going to do is
stay at home and have babies.

31:37.331 --> 31:41.704
I believe a man has gotta be king
in his own ranch type style tract house.

31:41.739 --> 31:43.728
You keep thinking that way, son.

31:43.729 --> 31:47.828
Oh yeah, that's the only way I...

32:09.620 --> 32:13.177
That's three.
Excuse me, Mr. President... Mr Tuttle...

32:13.212 --> 32:14.897
Sir... if you don't
mind my mentioning it.

32:14.898 --> 32:17.099
I think you're holding
the club incorrectly.

32:17.618 --> 32:20.017
Oh I don't think I'm very
good at holding anything.

32:20.118 --> 32:22.094
Well you should try the
new golf practice machine...

32:22.095 --> 32:23.095
in the sporting goods department.

32:23.153 --> 32:24.216
Golf practice machine?

32:24.217 --> 32:26.059
Yeah, I saw it this morning.
Very good.

32:26.094 --> 32:27.561
Would you like to try it out?

32:27.596 --> 32:28.280
Yes, I would.

32:28.415 --> 32:29.981
Well, I'll show it to you.
I'll take your bag for you.

32:29.982 --> 32:34.450
It's a very good thing. Just practice
and it's like you're on a gold course.

32:34.485 --> 32:37.114
I'd have been a very good
mailman if it wasn't for that.

32:37.249 --> 32:39.547
After you, Mr. President.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.611
I was a caddy when I was very young.

32:41.612 --> 32:43.638
You know, I like you, old man.

32:43.673 --> 32:45.859
Oh, that's good!
Very young old man.

32:47.810 --> 32:50.565
Oh! The more I rub the shinier it gets...

32:54.608 --> 32:55.807
Keep rubbing!

32:55.808 --> 33:00.722
Now don't get sore. You look
kinda cute all polished up.

33:00.757 --> 33:02.435
Shut up and keep rubbing!

33:05.806 --> 33:09.105
Going down!
Going...

33:11.603 --> 33:12.898
Going down?

33:17.602 --> 33:22.801
- Sporting goods, please.
- That's the third floor, sir.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.197
Thank you.

34:16.585 --> 34:18.585
Third floor.

34:42.078 --> 34:43.672
How does this work, son?

34:44.078 --> 34:46.942
This ball is attached to this iron tee.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.426
Now, it won't go nowhere,
no matter how hard you hit it.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.896
But it is also attached
electronically to that machine... see.

34:52.952 --> 34:53.945
And when you hit the ball...

34:53.946 --> 34:56.714
it registers on the machine
how far your ball went in yards

34:56.715 --> 34:58.233
like as if you were on a link.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.767
I see. Let me try it.

35:01.973 --> 35:05.186
Yeah here. Here's you
driver, Mr. President.

35:05.198 --> 35:06.571
Thank you Jackie.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.539
Oh, that was good.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.819
Now, how's this?
Is this...?

35:10.820 --> 35:12.419
No no... First you have
to approach the ball.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.076
Well, just get right over the ball.

35:14.077 --> 35:16.318
That's it. Now...
just don't let the knees...

35:16.353 --> 35:19.607
Well that's good. Although... maybe
you could just be a bit more upright.

35:19.668 --> 35:22.746
That's enough. Take the right
shoulder down and the right hand out...

35:22.767 --> 35:26.640
Take your left foot back... and
yes, left foot back... no that's the right.

35:26.641 --> 35:27.712
You see you have a set.

35:27.747 --> 35:30.480
Now just open the knees...
just a little bit, and the toes.

35:30.564 --> 35:33.191
Now just keep your chin down
and the eye on the ball.

35:33.192 --> 35:35.399
Open the right arm, if you can.

35:35.534 --> 35:38.112
The left should be stiff...
extend it down somewhat.

35:38.198 --> 35:41.034
Now back away, just drop back.
That's good.

35:41.035 --> 35:43.029
Now... how does that feel?
Just keep your head down.

35:43.064 --> 35:46.008
No... but on the ball. The eye
on the ball and the head down.

35:46.071 --> 35:48.486
Good? Now how does that feel?
Is that good that way?

35:48.487 --> 35:49.804
Now! You ready?

35:50.060 --> 35:52.367
Keep your around it and
swing and hit that thing!

35:53.258 --> 35:55.200
Good! Look at that!

35:55.857 --> 35:59.056
260 yards!
My boy, you've made a golfer out of me!

35:59.256 --> 36:01.656
But next time you'll even do better.
If you let me show you.

36:01.657 --> 36:02.431
Will I?

36:02.454 --> 36:07.982
Yeah! If you hold the club... like so
and keep you eye on the ball, and aim...

36:07.983 --> 36:09.354
and just easily...

36:12.953 --> 36:16.931
This is my first day!
Come, come come on.

36:43.045 --> 36:45.109
What a swing!
Still going!

36:48.443 --> 36:50.019
Yeah, but where is it going?

36:51.942 --> 36:54.284
Oh...This is one of those days...

37:04.039 --> 37:06.063
So he painted the flagpole successfully.

37:06.064 --> 37:08.898
But don't concern yourself, I'm on my toes.

37:28.032 --> 37:31.789
1,250 yards and still going!

37:31.824 --> 37:34.909
Oh! Thirteen is my unlucky number!
I hope it stops!

37:52.526 --> 37:57.925
1300! Let's go Mr Tuttle.
I told you, 13 is my unlucky number!

38:29.015 --> 38:30.877
He doesn't have any confidence left.

38:30.878 --> 38:33.471
That rich wealthy wife of his,
is gonna ruin him.

38:33.549 --> 38:35.770
And he's the nicest guy
I ever met in my whole life.

38:35.814 --> 38:40.478
- I think I've seen him in the elevator.
- Well, he and I are very very good pals.

38:40.513 --> 38:42.782
- I'll introduce you.
- Oh no. Don't do that.

38:42.783 --> 38:44.738
They're against employees going together.

38:44.811 --> 38:47.347
They might fire us.
I told you.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.761
Oh yeah, that's right, I forgot.

38:49.009 --> 38:51.781
- How did you like dinner, darling?
- Oh! Just great.

38:51.809 --> 38:54.189
You never once went for a
can opener or a frozen food.

38:54.224 --> 38:56.256
You found a whole new
fresh way of cooking.

38:56.307 --> 38:59.506
I think everything should
be fresh, don't you?

39:00.007 --> 39:00.907
Yeah!

39:01.506 --> 39:04.861
Romance should be fresh,
food should be fresh.

39:05.062 --> 39:09.898
- Marriage should be fresh.
- Yeah, it certainly should.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.618
Yeah, fresh...

39:11.653 --> 39:14.457
Everything will be fresh
with us, darling.

39:14.503 --> 39:16.298
Yeah. Don't you worry.

39:16.299 --> 39:19.741
Once we're married, I'll be the freshest
husband you ever saw in your whole life.

39:20.501 --> 39:22.573
Be fresh with me now, Norman!

39:22.702 --> 39:23.596
Oh wait!

39:24.400 --> 39:25.800
Oh Barbara, we're not married yet.

39:25.901 --> 39:27.532
I love you.

39:27.567 --> 39:28.648
I know dearest...

39:28.683 --> 39:32.297
But I... I'm trying to save up
$850 for down payment...

39:32.498 --> 39:35.597
for our Ranch type style
tract house in Queens.

39:35.598 --> 39:37.107
We could live here!

39:37.396 --> 39:39.122
Okay, but you love that house.

39:39.396 --> 39:40.763
I love you!

39:44.994 --> 39:47.315
Barbara, please not on a full stomach.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.394
Oh marry me!

39:48.493 --> 39:50.377
You like the way I cook.

39:53.292 --> 39:55.351
Yeah, but I'm getting a little heartburn.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.489
850...

40:04.989 --> 40:07.488
630...

40:11.488 --> 40:13.487
440...

40:15.486 --> 40:17.985
390...

40:19.486 --> 40:21.985
209...

40:27.381 --> 40:29.150
Could I save up at least fifty dollars?

40:29.182 --> 40:30.840
Oh! We could live here!

40:30.980 --> 40:33.059
I have a single bed!

40:38.479 --> 40:41.362
You win baby.
Go ahead.

40:44.478 --> 40:48.175
Norman! Norman!

40:52.475 --> 40:55.474
Mrs. Tuttle on one.

40:56.174 --> 41:00.973
- Good morning, boss!
- What are our plans for today, Quimby?

41:01.008 --> 41:04.872
I am putting Mr Norman Phiffier
in the lady shoe department.

41:04.907 --> 41:07.936
Lady shoe department?
What does that accomplish?

41:07.971 --> 41:12.970
At exactly 12:32, a lady will arrive
to purchase a pair of shoes.

41:13.005 --> 41:17.268
And that particular lady is a
professional lady I have engaged.

41:17.303 --> 41:20.624
Professional? What profession?

41:20.659 --> 41:24.980
A lady wrestler.
Champion lady wrestler.

41:25.466 --> 41:29.226
I like the way you think, Mr. Quimby.

41:40.562 --> 41:45.941
I can't wear that on.
Oh! No!

41:47.342 --> 41:49.629
No, that's terrible tight.
I can't!

41:50.164 --> 41:52.153
I know, but I can't get that one on.

41:52.658 --> 41:57.207
Well just wait one second.
Maybe... My shoe horn.

41:57.442 --> 42:00.852
Try it now. It might be a
little more comfortable.

42:00.856 --> 42:03.811
- Oh! Yes. Oh...
- How is that?

42:04.055 --> 42:06.111
- Still...
- Oh oh... your foot is in the box.

42:06.153 --> 42:08.423
Yes, still seems quite tight.

42:08.424 --> 42:12.523
Oh... It's not the most
comfortable shoe I've ever had on.

42:12.852 --> 42:16.366
Oh... your thumb is in there,
young man!

42:16.852 --> 42:19.871
Oh heavens.
Would you watch it, please?

42:29.248 --> 42:31.023
They were made for you.

42:31.024 --> 42:33.950
Oh. Thank you. They are
very attractive aren't they.

42:33.951 --> 42:36.291
They are really very very nice looking.

42:36.325 --> 42:40.245
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yes, I think I'll take the other pair.

42:40.446 --> 42:41.345
The other...

42:41.444 --> 42:42.344
These you mean?

42:42.545 --> 42:43.345
Yes.

42:43.547 --> 42:46.178
Well, you'd never know the difference.
They're almost identical.

42:46.244 --> 42:48.825
- Is that cash or charge?
- That will be a charge.

42:48.844 --> 42:49.844
A charge.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.213
Thank you very much.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.239
Here you are Mrs Glucksman.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.638
Thank you young man.

43:01.639 --> 43:03.363
You're welcome.
Thank you very much.

43:04.239 --> 43:05.039
Barbara!

43:05.140 --> 43:06.239
Hi, Norman!

43:06.537 --> 43:07.493
How are things going?

43:07.538 --> 43:09.437
Oh just great. I'm really
getting a feel of shoes now.

43:09.538 --> 43:10.434
Oh good.

43:10.469 --> 43:13.636
This morning I sold... four pairs
of shoes to a basketball team.

43:13.671 --> 43:16.135
There would have been five pairs
but one guy was on penalty.

43:16.136 --> 43:17.884
- Wonderful!
- Oh, that's not all.

43:17.935 --> 43:19.754
A man walks in this morning
with a little girl.

43:19.769 --> 43:21.781
And he said I'd like to
get golf shoes for her.

43:21.782 --> 43:22.978
I said, well sneakers are
good enough, you know.

43:23.013 --> 43:23.859
Help me please!

43:23.933 --> 43:26.067
Oh watch!
Show you how I operate.

43:26.134 --> 43:27.333
Go ahead.

43:29.432 --> 43:33.431
Something you women would like?
That is...

43:33.729 --> 43:35.162
Could I show you something in shoes?

43:35.230 --> 43:36.384
My feet, I hope.

43:37.828 --> 43:40.819
Oh! That is good.
Yes, the size and style?

43:40.854 --> 43:42.828
Black spring eliter, size three.

43:43.928 --> 43:47.578
Size... three?

43:47.613 --> 43:48.548
Three.

43:49.826 --> 43:51.111
Size three?

43:51.146 --> 43:52.824
Something the matter
with your hearing aid?

43:52.825 --> 43:56.177
Oh no, I could turn it up...
What I meant was... size three it is.

43:56.259 --> 43:59.375
The customer... black spring eliter.
Just excuse me one moment.

44:03.976 --> 44:05.805
Size three it is.

44:09.020 --> 44:10.128
Black spring eliter.

44:10.220 --> 44:12.831
One of our very very loveliest model.

44:15.919 --> 44:18.840
May I... size three.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.844
Must have had this on for some time.

44:31.815 --> 44:34.914
You've been a ... Chinese
with a cement by chance?

44:40.112 --> 44:42.111
Yup... this should be perfect.

44:42.112 --> 44:43.610
I'll be judge of that.
Slip em on.

44:43.710 --> 44:48.410
Yes, you certainly will.
And I'll slip them right on.

44:48.810 --> 44:50.049
That should be...

44:51.827 --> 44:54.376
They're not slipping very well, are they?

44:55.508 --> 44:58.793
If I could just grab one of these,
maybe the others will follow.

45:02.405 --> 45:05.473
This should be okay if
you don't mind cold heels.

45:05.508 --> 45:08.045
- Slip the other one on.
- Slip the other one on!

45:09.703 --> 45:14.121
Well... ok. Customer is always right.
Would you mind?

45:15.703 --> 45:17.216
Oh! It's a set.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.148
That's what the air is like, I suppose.

45:26.399 --> 45:28.437
Well, it looks like we gonna have to...

45:31.497 --> 45:33.204
Just let me get up.

45:33.205 --> 45:35.111
Good to hold here!

45:36.396 --> 45:39.264
Are you making improper advances to me!

45:39.930 --> 45:41.996
My back is to you, lady.
My back is to you.

45:41.997 --> 45:44.064
I'm not making anything.
I'm just trying to...

45:44.099 --> 45:45.662
Your wife is on the phone.

45:45.697 --> 45:47.195
- Hang up.
- Yes sir.

45:47.293 --> 45:48.405
Would you cut that out!

45:48.494 --> 45:50.091
Lady... lady.

45:50.526 --> 45:51.859
Would you put that shoe on!

45:51.892 --> 45:53.692
We need to please our
customers lady, and I'm getting...

45:53.793 --> 45:54.962
Would you cut that out!

45:54.991 --> 45:56.451
Would you wait one second!

45:57.092 --> 45:59.812
Norman, watch out!

45:59.890 --> 46:01.639
Wait lady. Lady don't go...

46:02.189 --> 46:06.026
Lady, let me just get... Here, it
will take a second. Let me just...

46:06.823 --> 46:10.343
Ma’am, ma’am. Lady!
Let me... Wait a second...

46:12.486 --> 46:13.990
Well you're crazy?

46:17.285 --> 46:20.835
The boots? Boots will be good.
Lady! Wait lady. What...?

46:20.884 --> 46:22.296
Lady, what's with the boots!

46:31.980 --> 46:34.144
Lady! Just for shoes?

46:39.879 --> 46:41.326
Norman!

47:07.871 --> 47:13.163
That's was a smarter!
Alright, who's the wise guy?

47:13.164 --> 47:14.484
Get away from me!

47:49.859 --> 47:51.397
Go already!

47:53.229 --> 47:55.885
Come on!
Hurry it up will ya!

48:08.454 --> 48:12.353
- Good morning, Norman!
- Oh! Good morning, Shirley!

48:12.388 --> 48:14.505
Still on your way to the top?

48:14.540 --> 48:16.518
Yeah, but I don't know how far I'm going.

48:16.851 --> 48:20.760
You can go as far as you want.
Why don't you give me a jingle.

48:21.386 --> 48:22.694
I'm in the phone book.

48:22.950 --> 48:26.636
Under Welcome, you big,
strong, handsome man.

48:32.348 --> 48:34.125
She's right boy.

48:40.345 --> 48:42.139
Go on, that's right boy.

49:15.735 --> 49:18.608
- Ready, Herman?
- Yeah, Mabel.

49:30.731 --> 49:34.330
- Ah you see, Mr Pepper...
- No! that's Phiffier, Mr Kastonten.

49:34.365 --> 49:37.915
Not Kastonten, Mr Cahastrophe.
The T is silent.

49:37.916 --> 49:39.128
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

49:39.193 --> 49:42.560
- It's Mr Cahastrophe.
- Excellent, Mr Fuber.

49:42.728 --> 49:45.197
No, there's no Fu. First you
have a Paf. It's Phiffier.

49:45.198 --> 49:49.168
There's no Fife and Fuf and Puf.
It's Phiffier. This is easy.

49:49.203 --> 49:50.102
What's your first name?

49:50.137 --> 49:50.827
Ervin.

49:50.928 --> 49:53.164
- Irving?
- Erving... Now come along.

49:53.199 --> 49:55.110
Yeah, well my name is Norman.
See that would be easy...

49:55.111 --> 49:55.811
What am I doing...?

49:55.812 --> 49:57.025
Hey just a minute!

49:58.323 --> 50:00.046
This is important.

50:16.776 --> 50:18.234
Yeah, well...

50:18.818 --> 50:21.682
Now that we're acquainted could
you tell me what my job is.

50:21.717 --> 50:25.816
All we stock here in the gourmet
department is exclusive imported delicacy.

50:25.851 --> 50:27.825
Oh like Swiss cheese from Holland?

50:27.826 --> 50:30.163
You mean EM Cheese from the Netherlands.

50:30.315 --> 50:34.421
No, no. That is common. You can
get that in any delicatessen.

50:35.234 --> 50:40.512
Along with hot pastrami. Here
we have only gourmet delight.

50:41.910 --> 50:46.185
- Here we have Escargot.
- Oh I dropped my button.

50:46.186 --> 50:47.086
You have what?

50:47.310 --> 50:50.810
Escargot. Snails.

50:51.309 --> 50:56.308
- Like from on a lawn?
- In all assorted flavours. Now come along!

50:56.807 --> 51:01.506
Now there is a stock...
roasted grasshoppers.

51:03.006 --> 51:06.302
Unfortunately, we have an
oversupply of roasted grasshoppers.

51:06.303 --> 51:08.453
- Yes I see.
- Too many roasted grasshoppers.

51:08.488 --> 51:09.682
Do you understand, Mr. Puffer?

51:10.103 --> 51:12.689
So we must now push the
roasted grasshoppers.

51:12.690 --> 51:13.400
Push the roasted...

51:13.402 --> 51:14.925
To every customer you must say

51:14.926 --> 51:19.151
"May I please suggest nice,
fresh, roasted grasshoppers".

51:19.301 --> 51:23.828
And another item we must push
because of oversupply, are these.

51:24.799 --> 51:30.497
- Toasted black ants in scent free salt.
- Toasted black ants in scent free salt.

51:30.698 --> 51:34.037
Oh that's almost better
than roasted grasshoppers.

51:34.238 --> 51:35.244
Delicious!

51:35.279 --> 51:39.260
- Oh they look just elegant.
- Have some. Go ahead. Have some.

51:39.295 --> 51:41.044
You must taste them.
You can't tell a

51:41.056 --> 51:43.094
customer how it taste
unless you taste them!

51:43.329 --> 51:45.619
And they're just... Mmm.

51:46.230 --> 51:48.971
Go ahead. Test them, taste them.

51:48.972 --> 51:51.371
You must recommend how
good they really are.

51:51.406 --> 51:54.025
- Oh they're very...
- Yeah ok perfectly toasted...

51:56.143 --> 51:57.255
Eat!
Yes now...

51:57.290 --> 52:00.989
- What are you going to push?
- I'm going... myself off a tall building.

52:01.024 --> 52:06.541
- Now speak up! What are you going to push?
- I'm going to push... toasted grass...

52:06.588 --> 52:11.443
grasshoppers and and ...
ants and those are very...

52:12.185 --> 52:14.900
Repeat. What you going to push?

52:14.901 --> 52:17.856
I'm going to push all
of the grasshoppers...

52:17.868 --> 52:20.176
and the toasted ants.
I understand!

52:20.283 --> 52:24.583
Very good indeed! Great!
Good work Puffer.

52:29.882 --> 52:33.281
- Norman are you alright?
- Oh I'm fine, fine.

52:33.316 --> 52:35.279
I'll meet you in an hour.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.280
An hour?

52:36.281 --> 52:37.311
For lunch!

52:43.778 --> 52:45.554
Now remember Phiffier.

52:45.555 --> 52:49.827
There's nothing to sell, everything's
on sale and automatically sells itself.

52:49.862 --> 52:51.675
Yes, I understand. I'm ready.

52:51.676 --> 52:53.077
You're sure you're ready?

52:53.174 --> 52:56.373
Well yeah. What's to be ready for?
Ladies going shopping... that's...

52:56.374 --> 52:57.620
What are so nervous about?

52:58.074 --> 53:01.236
Alright Jerome. Open the doors!

53:43.760 --> 53:45.621
Hey! Give me that tie!

53:47.259 --> 53:50.758
Let me have that coat! Did you think
I'm going to give it up now...!

53:51.357 --> 53:55.055
Lady. This coat is not...
Lady! Lady that's my... Lady!

53:55.657 --> 53:57.173
Lady! My coat!

53:57.474 --> 53:59.940
That's it! You can't buy this...
That's it!

54:05.253 --> 54:07.241
Can anyone find a pair of shorts?

54:15.751 --> 54:16.883
Just a minute!

54:22.122 --> 54:26.608
Wait a minute! Wait! Those are mine.
I bought them at Macy's.

54:26.709 --> 54:28.517
Those are mine! Wait a minute!

54:29.452 --> 54:32.197
Cover me!

54:59.611 --> 55:00.931
Phiffier!

55:06.810 --> 55:09.273
Yes, sir. Mr. Quimby sir.

55:09.308 --> 55:13.307
If we can get that ... through the jungle!

55:13.807 --> 55:16.706
Yes sir, Mr. Quimby! Here I am, sir!

55:16.741 --> 55:19.805
Mr Phiffier, could you
be stealing the TV set?

55:20.805 --> 55:27.269
Me stealing, Mr. Quimby?
Oh, I'd never steal anything.

55:27.304 --> 55:29.718
If I recollect correctly, Mr
Phiffier, you're supposed

55:29.730 --> 55:31.803
to be working in the
mattress department today.

55:31.838 --> 55:34.167
Oh yeah. I am working in the
mattress department today.

55:34.168 --> 55:35.231
And then what are you doing here?

55:35.602 --> 55:39.623
Well I was just merely trying to satisfy
a charge customer you see, sir.

55:39.800 --> 55:43.597
A lady that wanted to see on a
mattress just how good the TV set was

55:43.598 --> 55:44.923
so I borrowed two ladders.

55:44.924 --> 55:47.092
And I put a surfboard on
top of two ladders that I

55:47.104 --> 55:49.198
borrowed from the Hawaiian
hooky hula department.

55:49.233 --> 55:51.795
I just wanted to satisfy a
charge customer so I can be...

55:51.796 --> 55:55.246
the greatest salesman, just like you.
You who are my idol, Mr Quimby.

55:55.281 --> 55:57.668
If I ever turn out to be
as good as you I shall

55:57.680 --> 55:59.780
really live and breathe
the air of kings.

55:59.795 --> 56:02.048
Oh If I could ever be like you. Oh boy.

56:02.049 --> 56:03.149
It'd never be...

56:11.292 --> 56:13.391
Please hurry up. I getting sleepy.

56:13.392 --> 56:16.191
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry ma'am.

56:29.288 --> 56:31.751
How's that?

56:31.786 --> 56:34.106
This mattress is very comfortable
for TV viewing

56:34.170 --> 56:38.284
but I could tell better if you had
larger TV set like the one I have.

56:38.784 --> 56:40.463
Oh well. What size is that ma’am?

56:40.498 --> 56:43.740
"Channel Master" color set, 30 inch screen.

56:45.782 --> 56:49.281
Thirty? Yes ma’am.

57:15.773 --> 57:18.463
30 inch "Channel Master"

57:26.270 --> 57:27.698
How's that ma'am?

57:30.769 --> 57:32.249
Lady!

57:44.366 --> 57:47.063
Lady, you're sleeping through your nap!

57:52.262 --> 57:54.631
Oh miss! Lady!

57:55.562 --> 57:58.762
Narvalo, darling!
Narvalo!

57:59.662 --> 58:02.094
No! I'm Norman.
My name is Norman.

58:02.095 --> 58:03.358
I wanted to know if...

58:03.362 --> 58:05.161
Oh Narvalo, oh darling!

58:05.260 --> 58:09.867
You've come back to me! Oh darling!
You're back again! You're mine again.

58:10.259 --> 58:14.284
Oh darling! Narvalo! You've
come back to me, darling.

58:14.743 --> 58:16.310
I'm Norman!

58:16.311 --> 58:18.364
Fifi... Phiffier!

58:18.756 --> 58:22.675
Lady, this is no way to buy a mattress.
Lady, I'm Norman.

58:23.754 --> 58:25.653
Lady, I'm Norman!

58:29.554 --> 58:31.298
Mr. Quimby!

58:37.457 --> 58:38.278
Watch it.

58:39.751 --> 58:43.011
I hope you feel better soon, Mr. Quimby.

58:43.284 --> 58:46.229
Oh Mr. Quimby, are you alright?
I'm terribly sorry.

58:46.400 --> 58:50.247
Oh you clonker! Get out of the way you...!

58:50.382 --> 58:53.909
That boy! He's gonna drive me crazy!

58:56.244 --> 58:59.444
Norman! Norman, what happened?

58:59.645 --> 59:00.445
Everything!

59:00.544 --> 59:02.743
I heard there was an accident
in the mattress department.

59:02.744 --> 59:06.443
That's right. Mr. Quimby's right.
Everything I touch goes wrong.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.943
Oh! That's not true.

59:08.044 --> 59:09.531
I've never done anything right. Never!

59:09.842 --> 59:11.142
Listen, darling...

59:11.143 --> 59:13.142
No! You should get yourself another guy.
I am a loser.

59:13.441 --> 59:14.941
Norman, don't say that!

59:15.142 --> 59:16.141
No, it's true.

59:16.239 --> 59:19.438
You should get yourself a guy
that isn't as accident prone.

59:19.473 --> 59:21.038
I have found my guy!

59:21.139 --> 59:21.839
What?

59:21.840 --> 59:23.239
I found my fellow!

59:23.437 --> 59:26.636
- What? I can't hear you!
- Oh! Come in here.

59:26.637 --> 59:28.228
I'm telling you. What I'm
telling you is right.

59:28.329 --> 59:30.607
You should really get to somebody, I'm...

59:31.036 --> 59:33.800
I said I found my fellow.
It's you.

59:34.235 --> 59:38.034
No wonder everything is going wrong.
Look at the jobs they're giving you.

59:38.069 --> 59:41.083
As though they're trying to give you
the worst job they can think of.

59:41.633 --> 59:45.575
And I'm proud of you for not
giving it up, for sticking to it.

59:46.232 --> 59:50.730
Don't you understand, Norman. I'm proud
of you and I love more than I ever did?

59:51.029 --> 59:53.229
You're honest and you try hard.

59:53.230 --> 59:57.229
What more could any girl want from
the boy she's going to marry?

59:57.264 --> 01:00:01.505
And besides, there's something else
about you that makes you perfect.

01:00:01.506 --> 01:00:03.858
What.. What's this something else?

01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:11.222
You have sexy lips.

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:43.014
Ladies and gentlemen, the
great Tuttle department store

01:00:43.026 --> 01:00:45.435
is proud to bring you this
great demonstration...

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:49.673
In this window, you see Mr. Norman
Phiffier tiring himself out...

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:53.214
to show the greatness of
the great Tuttle mattress.

01:00:53.713 --> 01:00:56.076
Mr Phiffier has been on the
exercise bike for three

01:00:56.088 --> 01:00:58.417
hours and is tired enough
to go to sleep right now.

01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:02.211
Right Mr. Phiffier?

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:06.809
Oh but Tuttle's Department store
doesn't think he's tired enough.

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:08.062
What?

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:13.282
Mr. Phiffier is now going
to walk around this great

01:01:13.294 --> 01:01:16.023
Tuttle store so that her
gets even more tired.

01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:25.704
And here he comes, ladies and gentlemen!
Mr. Phiffier on his very first lap.

01:01:25.705 --> 01:01:27.527
Let's give him a big hand.

01:01:32.703 --> 01:01:35.122
And here comes Mr. Phiffier,
on his tenth lap

01:01:35.134 --> 01:01:37.301
around the great Tuttle
Department store.

01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:39.326
Look at that boy move.

01:01:49.698 --> 01:01:55.326
And ladies and gentlemen, here
comes Mr Phiffier on his 56th lap.

01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:59.188
Isn't that boy doing fine?
That's fine, Norman.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:28.549
Here, Norman. Stop.
Have some water.

01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:46.222
Just what are you trying to do, Mr. Quimby?

01:02:46.315 --> 01:02:48.220
Do? Do what Barbara?

01:02:48.281 --> 01:02:52.180
It seems to me you're making things
as difficult as possible for Norman.

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:54.436
You mean... your friend Norman?

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:57.312
I think I see, Mr Quimby.

01:02:59.077 --> 01:03:01.157
Hello? Yes?

01:03:02.677 --> 01:03:06.721
Aah!  Well...

01:03:09.575 --> 01:03:13.174
Barbara! This is a surprise.

01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:20.090
Darling, I've had your room redone. It's so
pretty. You'll love it, I know you will.

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:22.294
Thank you very much
mother, but I'm sure I've

01:03:22.306 --> 01:03:24.671
outgrown the color scheme
you've picked out for me.

01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:27.688
And you can be sure that I
know what you're trying

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.833
to do to Norman and it
isn't going to work.

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:32.825
Rubbish! You're a Tuttle woman!
You couldn't possibly love him.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.661
I love him and I'm going to marry him.

01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:40.146
You can give me a wedding present if
you please, please just disinherit me!

01:03:40.165 --> 01:03:41.318
You will never marry him.

01:03:41.366 --> 01:03:46.165
Mother, if you do one more thing to
interfere with Norman and me...

01:03:46.665 --> 01:03:49.765
I promise you, you will never see me again.

01:03:50.065 --> 01:03:52.936
Barbara, you've made a terrible mistake.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:57.684
The only mistake I ever made was
being born without a mother.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.678
You have that, Shirley?

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:20.139
Yes sir. Memo to ladies
sportswear department.

01:05:20.174 --> 01:05:23.138
The bikini cut ski pants are now selling
for the month sale next Monday.

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:24.834
And now the toy department.

01:05:24.938 --> 01:05:28.137
Memo to the buyer. Order 3
carloads of disintegrator guns,

01:05:28.372 --> 01:05:30.004
5 carloads of spacesuits

01:05:30.035 --> 01:05:32.813
and 12 carloads of approved and
semi-harmless atomic bombs.

01:05:33.114 --> 01:05:35.421
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.815
That's the new elevator operator.

01:05:47.854 --> 01:05:49.490
Isn't she beautiful?

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:53.608
Are you drunk, Quimby?

01:05:53.629 --> 01:05:56.428
Your daughter Barbara just bought a
wedding gown in our bridal shop.

01:05:56.429 --> 01:05:59.409
and told Ms Johnson that she was
getting married in one week.

01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:00.546
Well it can't happen!

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:03.553
But frankly Mrs Tuttle, this
boy Phiffier is a dynamo.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:04.951
Nothing stops him.

01:06:05.126 --> 01:06:08.116
Forgive me for saying this
but this boy has character.

01:06:08.226 --> 01:06:11.887
And I know what character is!
I remember when I had it.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.147
Oh! Shut up Quimby. Let me think.

01:06:15.122 --> 01:06:19.621
I've got one week to stop this
terrible tragedy. Let me think.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.619
What are you supposed to be?
A Boy Scout leader?

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:35.157
- I'm a great white hunter.
- Ha ha. What did you ever catch?

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:39.089
The measles. Now beat it you
drunken kid before I shoot you!

01:06:46.615 --> 01:06:50.310
Do you work here?
Are a salesman?

01:06:50.345 --> 01:06:52.341
Well, not until I sell something.
I'm new in the store...

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.112
- Show me your elephant guns.
- Elephant guns? Yes right this way.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:57.611
We have...

01:06:59.111 --> 01:07:00.719
My heavens. If it isn't.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.386
Aren't you Emily Rothgraber,
the famous big game hunter?

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.110
No autographs. Just show
me your elephant guns!

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:10.571
Oh Miss Rothgraber!
I see you on the television all the time!

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:11.456
You look the same in person.

01:07:11.642 --> 01:07:14.907
What a powerful woman!
To watch when you had that gorilla...

01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:18.106
and he jumped all over, and you
hit one shot and roped it...

01:07:18.605 --> 01:07:20.843
And that boa constrictor
when he opened up and ate

01:07:20.855 --> 01:07:23.104
the cameraman and the camera
and part of the rock!

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:27.770
A greatest wrestling where you tie that
snake and you ripped it and broke it also.

01:07:27.805 --> 01:07:31.230
It was fantastic! You've gotta be the
bravest woman in the whole world!

01:07:31.237 --> 01:07:34.791
- Are you married?
- No, no, not yet.

01:07:34.902 --> 01:07:39.001
Well if you were, then your wife would
be the bravest woman in the world.

01:07:39.036 --> 01:07:45.098
- Now get me an elephant gun!
- Yes, I certainly will.

01:07:45.099 --> 01:07:50.374
And you're strong. And you would have to
be because these are very heavy guns...

01:07:53.596 --> 01:07:56.095
Give me some shells!

01:08:00.394 --> 01:08:04.012
Shells? Oh you mean elephant shells?

01:08:04.094 --> 01:08:08.459
No! No you see I am going
canary hunting with this gun.

01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:15.417
- Of course, I mean elephant shells!
- Yes I thought what it was...

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:21.184
Here you are. Elephant shells.
And they're very good.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:23.010
But that was a good gag about the canary.

01:08:23.045 --> 01:08:26.252
The action is slow on this gun.
Get me a Browning elephant gun.

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:28.770
- A brown elephant gun?
- Brown... ING!

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.667
Brown-ing. Oh well. Here is a Browning.

01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:34.977
It's just as heavy as the
other one, but that’s

01:08:34.988 --> 01:08:37.085
the newest, finest
Browning big game gun.

01:08:37.584 --> 01:08:40.051
That's really a... Well if
you ever shot in a canary...

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:43.087
- Much better. I'll take it.
- Oh good. A sale!

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.080
- I mean...
- A charge.

01:08:44.081 --> 01:08:45.421
- A charge. Yeah.
- Charge.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:52.100
Thank you very much, Miss Rothgraber!
We'll charge it.

01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:06.768
Big white hunter!
Lousy TV show anyhow...

01:09:06.812 --> 01:09:09.636
with monkeys, orangutans and giraffes!

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.573
And point!

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.559
Very good, Mr. President Tuttle sir!
That was a fine pot.

01:10:06.359 --> 01:10:08.522
You're doing just great,
Mr President Tuttle sir?

01:10:08.523 --> 01:10:09.687
Getting better eh, son?

01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:12.305
Better? My heavens. Your
grip is magnificent. Your

01:10:12.317 --> 01:10:14.637
stance is excellent. You
got it all made now.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.256
Thanks to you boy.
And how are you doing?

01:10:16.457 --> 01:10:17.394
Oh just fine, thank you.

01:10:17.456 --> 01:10:20.755
I'm giving a little wedding Sat...
that is I'm getting married Saturday.

01:10:20.756 --> 01:10:22.585
And well I need a best man.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.954
I trust my girl.
And I trust you and...

01:10:24.989 --> 01:10:26.418
I can't think of anything nice than having

01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:28.092
the two people I trust at my wedding.

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.550
Norman, you honor me.

01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:43.561
Oh! Well thank you very much, Mr. Tuttle.
It's just that I want you for my best man.

01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:47.748
I haven't been a man much less a
best man since I get married myself.

01:10:48.383 --> 01:10:49.621
Where is your wedding taking place?

01:10:49.622 --> 01:10:51.658
Oh! Well my girl picked
a cute little chapel.

01:10:51.693 --> 01:10:53.691
And it's beautiful... with a bell...

01:10:53.726 --> 01:10:57.509
No chapel Norman! You're going
to get married in my house.

01:10:57.544 --> 01:11:00.096
Boy I've got a house is so big, I
get lost going to the bathroom.

01:11:00.178 --> 01:11:02.479
Oh I'm awfully sorry, but
my girl is very high class

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.542
and she would never have
a wedding in the bath.

01:11:04.577 --> 01:11:07.592
The last wedding that took place
in that house was my own.

01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:09.246
I've got to get the smell
of that out of the place.

01:11:09.347 --> 01:11:11.237
Boy, I got a big elegant place.

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:16.572
We got lawns and gardens and marble
staircase and a great big cathedral organ!

01:11:16.642 --> 01:11:22.329
Oh that's magnificent. I couldn't think...
I can't think... Excuse me.

01:11:22.364 --> 01:11:26.241
What... what about the little woman?

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:33.527
- Got to consider her.
- Well as you said, Phiffier...

01:11:33.934 --> 01:11:37.372
A man has gotta be king in his own
ranch type style tract house!

01:11:37.533 --> 01:11:39.258
And I'm beginning to feel like a king.

01:11:40.033 --> 01:11:43.878
You bring your girl over to my house,
Norman. I'm sure she'll love it.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:45.985
You're very confident now.
That's wonderful.

01:11:46.031 --> 01:11:47.754
And I shall bring her.
And I'll surprise her.

01:11:47.755 --> 01:11:49.022
I won't tell her that
she's going to meet you.

01:11:49.082 --> 01:11:49.800
Good!

01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:52.703
I could just see this. A wedding with
a garden and a chapel and an organ.

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:55.767
And a girl dancing with bells
ringing from organ chapelling...

01:11:55.768 --> 01:12:00.431
What a beautiful here, comes my friend,
all dressed in twang, I have a ...

01:12:56.512 --> 01:13:01.710
I don't understand you JP!
I really don't understand you!

01:13:01.745 --> 01:13:04.875
The very idea of you
turning over our home to a

01:13:04.887 --> 01:13:08.357
couple of minor employees
for their dreary wedding...

01:13:08.392 --> 01:13:12.910
I'm not turning over our home.
I'm turning over our house.

01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:16.488
Our house has never been
our home, Mrs. Tuttle.

01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:17.539
What did you say?

01:13:20.505 --> 01:13:25.489
A man has got to be king in own
ranch type style tract house.

01:13:25.603 --> 01:13:28.203
That's a quote Mrs. Tuttle

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.942
What happened to you?

01:13:31.003 --> 01:13:37.302
I made a 15 foot putt in my
great big empty office today...

01:13:37.337 --> 01:13:38.885
That's what happened to me.

01:13:38.924 --> 01:13:42.853
Moreover I made that 15 foot putt

01:13:42.854 --> 01:13:48.897
on that great big piece of bluegrass green
carpet you were so kind as to give me.

01:13:48.898 --> 01:13:51.698
Not that that was what that make
the difference you understand?

01:13:52.032 --> 01:13:57.071
The difference was I can putt.
You understand?

01:13:57.172 --> 01:13:58.786
Putt putt putt putt putt.

01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:04.492
Not only can I putt putt. I can talk
talk talk. And I'm talking to you!

01:14:04.493 --> 01:14:08.100
You who drove our daughter
away from this house!

01:14:08.135 --> 01:14:10.130
I did not drive her away!

01:14:10.165 --> 01:14:14.412
No, you're quite right. She had the
good sense to escape from you.

01:14:14.447 --> 01:14:16.487
More sense than I ever had!

01:14:16.522 --> 01:14:18.520
Well I didn't want her to marry a boob.

01:14:18.523 --> 01:14:19.947
And why not?

01:14:19.948 --> 01:14:23.816
Why shouldn't she marry a boob?
You did!

01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:26.686
All you Tuttle women married boobs!

01:14:27.087 --> 01:14:29.946
That's the only kind of men
that have married Tuttle women.

01:14:30.087 --> 01:14:31.884
Oh! Get out of my house!

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:34.584
Now, you've said it!
That's right! Your house!

01:14:34.985 --> 01:14:39.269
But tonight I'm entertaining
two minor employees at dinner!

01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:42.447
Well you entertain them alone!
I'm going to bed!

01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:44.116
Good!
That's the best news I've heard!

01:14:44.117 --> 01:14:47.554
They won't have to meet you.
Go! Go to bed!

01:14:57.678 --> 01:15:05.331
Well honey, I hope your secret romance
is half the man Norman Phiffier is.

01:15:05.975 --> 01:15:07.934
Norman, I don't understand.

01:15:08.269 --> 01:15:10.855
Wait. You'll see.
It's a surprise.

01:15:10.875 --> 01:15:12.024
How can I see?

01:15:12.076 --> 01:15:14.376
When we get there, you'll see.

01:15:14.674 --> 01:15:17.239
Alright Norman.
I trust you.

01:15:17.274 --> 01:15:19.879
You get to meet our best man.
And I trust him.

01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:25.565
No peeking.
And wait!

01:15:36.267 --> 01:15:38.533
Here driver. Keep the change.
I work at Tuttles.

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:40.321
Thank you very much sir.

01:15:40.365 --> 01:15:41.396
Come on, dear.

01:15:43.466 --> 01:15:44.508
That's it.

01:15:49.764 --> 01:15:52.457
Mr. President, I'd like
you to meet Barbara.

01:15:53.463 --> 01:15:55.341
Barbara, this is Mr Tuttle.

01:15:55.662 --> 01:15:59.255
Miss Fuller...
Mr. Tuttle... This is our best man.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:01.476
He's the best friend I have beside you.

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.958
Well, I... I know Miss Fuller.
She's one of our elevator operators.

01:16:09.957 --> 01:16:13.879
Oh yes. I believe I've seen
you in the elevator, Mr Tuttle.

01:16:14.214 --> 01:16:16.182
So you two are going to get married?

01:16:16.456 --> 01:16:19.009
Well I couldn't be more pleased.

01:16:23.054 --> 01:16:26.837
- Thank you, dad.
- I couldn't be happier dear.

01:16:26.954 --> 01:16:28.927
Oh! You act like you know
one another all your life.

01:16:28.928 --> 01:16:30.029
And you just met.

01:16:30.488 --> 01:16:31.422
That's good.

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:32.967
Thank you, Mr. Tuttle.

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:37.119
Don't hold high.

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:59.457
- Hey, you!
- Oohh.

01:16:59.458 --> 01:17:02.101
I'm leaving your house!

01:17:08.344 --> 01:17:09.216
Yes!

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:10.705
Mrs Tuttle on one, sir.

01:17:11.542 --> 01:17:12.901
Hello, Mrs. Tuttle?

01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:14.903
Quimby, how are you?

01:17:15.138 --> 01:17:16.130
Terrible!

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:18.717
Going insane waiting to hear from you.

01:17:18.974 --> 01:17:21.742
That baboon of a boy has just about
rigged the good name of Tuttle.

01:17:21.973 --> 01:17:23.760
I thought you said he had character?

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.936
But there's no place in business
for a man of character!

01:17:26.937 --> 01:17:29.336
His sincerity could ruin the world!

01:17:29.537 --> 01:17:30.194
Naturally.

01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:33.193
That's why we the innocents
here must be in charge.

01:17:33.934 --> 01:17:36.343
Relax. I have a plan.

01:17:36.378 --> 01:17:37.484
Well tell me, tell me!

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.447
I'll come with anything to get rid of him!

01:17:39.633 --> 01:17:42.586
Well I'm on my way in. I can't
trust this to a telephone.

01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:44.721
I'll be there in ten minutes.

01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:49.256
Now this machine will not only
wash your husband's clothes,

01:17:49.257 --> 01:17:51.084
but it will also wash your husband.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:54.030
I might add.
This carries a lifetime guarantee.

01:17:54.129 --> 01:17:55.028
Oh! That's good.

01:17:55.029 --> 01:17:56.996
I'm just about to be
married and my marriage

01:17:57.008 --> 01:17:58.767
is going to last longer
than a lifetime.

01:17:59.063 --> 01:18:01.025
And he must be a very lucky man.

01:18:01.026 --> 01:18:04.719
And rich too.
He's already saved up $790.

01:18:05.126 --> 01:18:06.824
Only $60 to go.

01:18:06.926 --> 01:18:12.380
No, with the quarterly interest, dear,
it is now $793 with only $57 to go.

01:18:13.023 --> 01:18:15.098
Like I said, he's a rich man.

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:18.676
Well, marrying you is what
makes him rich, miss.

01:18:18.711 --> 01:18:21.351
How very gallant you are, dear.

01:18:21.352 --> 01:18:23.460
Oh, it's nothing at all dear.

01:18:28.918 --> 01:18:30.958
Appliance salesman!

01:18:32.517 --> 01:18:37.063
Salesman!
Is there no one in this department?

01:18:37.616 --> 01:18:42.191
Where's the manager?
Appliance salesman!

01:18:42.226 --> 01:18:43.286
Yes ma'am... Ooh!

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:07.991
Where is Francois?

01:19:07.992 --> 01:19:10.766
Oh! Francois is he the chauffeur?
Well he's fine.

01:19:10.839 --> 01:19:13.907
He's with the nurse.
He... He's fixing his foot.

01:19:13.942 --> 01:19:16.796
Well, was there something you
wanted to purchase, madam?

01:19:16.909 --> 01:19:20.370
I did purchase something.
I purchased this vacuum cleaner...

01:19:20.405 --> 01:19:24.712
in this store, six years ago.
And now it doesn't operate.

01:19:24.904 --> 01:19:29.220
Oh well I'm terribly sorry. But there
is no guarantee on anything beyond...

01:19:29.225 --> 01:19:33.095
My guarantee is my personal
friendship with Phoebe Tuttle.

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:36.365
Oh! Oh you mean Mrs Tuttle,
this... from this...

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.248
Oh! Well the guarantee and the warranty
on this particular item is for years.

01:19:40.249 --> 01:19:42.238
What seems to be the
trouble with this one?

01:19:42.281 --> 01:19:47.011
Well, the suction is weak.
My carpets are 3 inches thick and...

01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:49.498
3 inches thick?

01:19:50.265 --> 01:19:53.409
You better not ever invite Mickey Rooney
or you'll never be able to find him.

01:19:54.395 --> 01:19:56.361
3 inches thick!
Mickey Rooney!

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:02.462
Well, let's see if we can figure this out.

01:20:02.463 --> 01:20:05.020
So you're suffering from
a weak suction, eh?

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:07.671
Well that will never do. You
have to have a strong suction.

01:20:08.442 --> 01:20:09.772
Really pull in.

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:15.988
What are you doing?

01:20:16.023 --> 01:20:18.872
Well you see in these
newer models, very often

01:20:18.884 --> 01:20:21.319
the wires get criss crossed.
Understand?

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.265
- You see what I mean?
- No.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:28.344
You see if this red wire here ever
makes a direct contact with the yellow

01:20:28.387 --> 01:20:30.566
by the elongation of the wire.

01:20:30.567 --> 01:20:33.975
Then naturally it's going to
short out and you won't get...

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:37.084
Now I think that by...
getting at the entire wire

01:20:37.096 --> 01:20:40.182
section back after the
snipping and the cutting...

01:20:40.217 --> 01:20:42.394
I think you'll find
that this might very

01:20:42.406 --> 01:20:44.756
possibly work better
than it did originally.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.419
Are you sure it will operate now?

01:20:47.454 --> 01:20:49.114
Oh well, I never lost a patient yet.

01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:51.783
You just stand right
by and watch this. And

01:20:51.795 --> 01:20:54.562
if it doesn't work, I'll
be a monkey's uncle.

01:21:04.152 --> 01:21:06.620
You should get a much
stronger suck in suction now.

01:21:15.657 --> 01:21:18.576
My pearls!

01:21:25.659 --> 01:21:27.558
Isn't it's in the works, ma'am?

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:32.042
Turn it off!

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:36.126
- The switch doesn't work.
- Alright do something!

01:21:48.351 --> 01:21:50.772
And in a moment the toast pops up.

01:22:29.081 --> 01:22:31.073
You see why I'm almost crazy!

01:22:32.879 --> 01:22:35.338
Oh please! Let me do it myself!

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.045
You're mad!

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:23.872
Oh my shoes!
Oh somebody!

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.936
My hat!
My shoes!

01:23:34.789 --> 01:23:36.811
No no no no no!

01:23:37.406 --> 01:23:38.662
Oh my corset!

01:23:40.843 --> 01:23:43.442
No no no!

01:24:14.876 --> 01:24:16.428
You idiot!

01:24:39.088 --> 01:24:41.222
Oh oh dad.
I see mother.

01:24:41.257 --> 01:24:44.155
Oh oh! That's trouble.
Come on. Don't let her see us.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.584
Where's my dog?
Where's my Fifi?

01:25:12.283 --> 01:25:16.675
Oh oh... My Fifi!

01:25:16.882 --> 01:25:19.495
You sucked my Fifi in!

01:25:19.519 --> 01:25:22.168
You brute!
You're mad!

01:25:22.982 --> 01:25:24.691
You are a monster!

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.618
You... You're insane!
You're a monster!

01:25:40.076 --> 01:25:41.655
Hold on, Fifi!

01:25:43.636 --> 01:25:44.725
Here we come, baby.

01:25:49.078 --> 01:25:51.077
He's got a knife!
He's gonna blow up that!

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.305
Mrs Tuttle, I think you're right!

01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:55.075
What do you all want?
It's nothing I'm gonna do...

01:25:57.575 --> 01:26:00.168
Relax! Take it easy. Isn't it...?
I'm just going to give a little...

01:26:00.172 --> 01:26:03.010
Then it's gonna... Psst! That's it.

01:26:03.806 --> 01:26:04.618
Okay!

01:26:15.978 --> 01:26:19.400
Help me, Mrs. Tuttle!

01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:21.587
Fifi! Where are you?

01:26:21.622 --> 01:26:26.401
Don't worry. I...I...
Here... see? She's fine.

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:29.897
Oh Fifi!

01:26:32.566 --> 01:26:36.933
Fifi's alright.
Here... Here's Fifi.

01:26:37.366 --> 01:26:40.297
We shall never trade in this store again!

01:26:40.332 --> 01:26:41.688
Well I'm terribly sorry ma'am.

01:26:41.719 --> 01:26:45.567
You hear Phoebe Tuttle?
We shall never trade in this store again!

01:26:45.602 --> 01:26:47.536
I don't blame you, Hazel.

01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:49.774
I'm terribly sorry, but...

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:53.165
Oh! I saw your picture
in Mr Tuttle's office.

01:26:53.464 --> 01:26:55.133
You're Mrs. Tuttle?

01:26:57.565 --> 01:27:01.323
- Isn't this yours Mrs Tuttle?
- It was.

01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:05.192
Well, let me put it back
all the way it was...

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.026
I'll just... see how it's
almost a perfect fit.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.915
Maybe if you look... you see you
could still... peek through it...

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.845
Take your stupid hands
off me, you imbecile!

01:27:21.715 --> 01:27:23.314
Take your stupid hands off...

01:27:23.349 --> 01:27:24.356
Mother, stop it!

01:27:24.559 --> 01:27:28.311
Well, I told you I was sorry Mrs. Tuttle...
Mother?

01:27:28.656 --> 01:27:31.057
That's Mrs Tuttle,
Phoebe Tuttle that owns this store.

01:27:31.092 --> 01:27:34.056
This store and 25 other stores.

01:27:34.057 --> 01:27:38.356
And they will all be inherited my
daughter, Barbara Tuttle. You hear me?

01:27:38.491 --> 01:27:42.167
Do you hear me? By my
daughter, Barbara Tuttle!

01:27:42.554 --> 01:27:44.159
- Norman...
- I hear.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.001
Norman, son... I... I...

01:27:46.329 --> 01:27:48.212
And you too.
I trusted you also.

01:27:48.301 --> 01:27:50.335
And the other night when
we came up to the house.

01:27:50.336 --> 01:27:51.927
You knew it was your
daughter all the time...

01:27:51.962 --> 01:27:52.953
and you didn't say anything.

01:27:53.154 --> 01:27:55.292
Son, I want you two to get married.

01:27:55.352 --> 01:27:56.319
I'm all for it!

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:56.945
Yeah sure...

01:27:57.051 --> 01:27:59.751
and then wind up in a big empty
office putting the rest of my life?

01:27:59.785 --> 01:28:00.569
No thanks.

01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:04.411
I think I'm better off with the poodle
dog walking service. If you don't mind.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:05.114
Norman!

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:10.050
Happy, my dear?

01:28:12.048 --> 01:28:16.810
Oh daddy.

01:28:35.151 --> 01:28:38.240
THE I'M SORRY POODLE SERVICE

01:28:45.542 --> 01:28:48.626
ME TOO SORRY POODLE SERVICE

01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:59.201
FORGIVE ALL OF US POODLE SERVICE

01:29:01.744 --> 01:29:03.629
Mutt! Mutt! Wait for me!

01:29:06.303 --> 01:29:07.436
Mutt! Wait for me!

01:29:08.305 --> 01:29:14.373
