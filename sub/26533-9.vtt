Previously onCharmed...MAGGIE: Wait.
I know what you're feeling.

00:06.049 --> 00:09.313
ALISTAIR: I don't see
the Scythe of Tartarus.Sorry, Dad, it...

00:09.357 --> 00:11.098
got away.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.316
MACY: Our new lab manager
starts today.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.405
Julia Wagner.I've heard she's difficult.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.406
Where did you see this mark?

00:15.450 --> 00:17.104
MACY:
On a friend.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.105
Oh, no. Stay away from him.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.584
They're not for you.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.369
I may be weeks too late,
but if there's any chance at all

00:21.412 --> 00:22.935
for us to have another shot,

00:22.979 --> 00:24.372
I want it.GALVIN: Okay.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.416
All right, well,
I-I got a few things

00:25.460 --> 00:27.375
to finish up here first, so...

00:27.418 --> 00:28.463
MACY: I'll wait. MEL: Who are you?

00:28.506 --> 00:29.942
And why are you trying
to kill me?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.596
I'm Jada. I'm half-witch...

00:31.640 --> 00:33.250
half-Whitelighter.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.425
I'm not here to
kill you, Mel.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.687
I'm trying to recruit you.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.125
We believe the newly-formed
Sisters of Arcana

00:38.168 --> 00:39.778
are responsible
for the death of your mother

00:39.822 --> 00:41.345
and the other Elders.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.000
You want us
to fight the Sarcana?No.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.219
We want you, Mel,

00:45.262 --> 00:47.308
to join them.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.368
What's going on?

01:04.412 --> 01:06.675
What do you want?

01:06.718 --> 01:08.546
Hey.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.592
You're the one that broke in.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.986
Sorry.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.119
One of my comrades
overreacted.

01:16.163 --> 01:19.427
So, does this mean you want in?

01:19.470 --> 01:21.298
I don't know.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.692
You might want to reevaluate
your recruitment methods.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.433
Well, we're not the Elders,
who just force you

01:25.476 --> 01:27.696
into their way of life
once you become a witch.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.306
We're here for you, Mel.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.569
I think you belong with us.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.398
Do you want this or not?

01:36.531 --> 01:37.880
MEL:
If I want in

01:37.923 --> 01:40.404
I'm supposed to come back
for initiation.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.971
Oh, just like Kappa.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.365
Don't freak out if they
make you do weird stuff,

01:44.408 --> 01:47.759
like eat Oreos
until you puke.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.501
It's just part of initiation.HARRY: Well, you'll be lucky

01:50.545 --> 01:52.155
if it's only weird stuff.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.332
Look, Mel, this is an
extremely dangerous mission.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.334
The Sarcana
are terrorists.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.510
They'll think nothing
of killing you if you're caught.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.556
Not to mention
they are adept at mind games.

02:01.599 --> 02:05.081
You could be seduced.Harry, your hysteria
is not helping.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.778
I beg your pardon-- hyster...

02:06.822 --> 02:09.390
Is it quite necessary
to use that anti

02:09.433 --> 02:11.392
Not to mention, I have
yet to find any evidence

02:11.435 --> 02:13.263
that they're evil.Mel,

02:13.307 --> 02:15.091
I think I'm with Harry
on this one.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.440
The whole thing
seems kind of shady.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.833
Plus, if they
really did

02:17.876 --> 02:20.488
kill Mom...Then this is
our big chance.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.794
You guys, if me
infiltrating The Sarcana

02:22.838 --> 02:24.405
leads us to Mom's killer

02:24.448 --> 02:26.276
and prevents other
Elders from being killed,

02:26.320 --> 02:28.235
then it's worth it.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.454
We also need to know who
they released from Tartarus.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.414
We're witches.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.633
We face danger every day.

02:35.677 --> 02:36.895
This is just

02:36.939 --> 02:39.289
one more thing
on the to-do list.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.177
That was easy.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.656
You'd think they'd have
some safeguards

02:58.700 --> 02:59.918
in a place like this.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.355
PARKER:
It should be over there.

Hello, Saint Dragos.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.671
We've come to relieve you
of your bling.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.330
I always figured that
the Amulet of the Archangels

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245

impressive.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.718
I should just stay away

09:54.681 --> 09:56.639
Oh, come on.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.250
Get some Christmas spirit.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.426
I do feel a little bad,
not telling him.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.559
Your brotherly affection
would be cute

10:03.603 --> 10:05.909
if it wasn't so useless.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.519
And now...

10:07.563 --> 10:10.871
Parker is too soft for that.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.916
The prophecy's clear:

10:12.960 --> 10:15.049
the Source
will possess a demon

10:15.092 --> 10:18.095
born of a human.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.054
Aw, don't be jealous.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.925
You get to be the fun one.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.274
And we will finally

10:23.318 --> 10:25.973
have all the power we need.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.932
All in the family.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.721
Merry Christmas.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.038
So, what do we do?
We can't kick Galvin out.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.605
He can't even move
from the couch.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.042
We have to at least wait
till his leg feels better.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.045
If I go near him,
he's obviously doomed.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.394
You.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.962
Go ply him with alcohol
and conversation.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.268
Just act like you want
to get to know him.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.749
He's fun. Should have
plenty to talk about.

11:02.792 --> 11:06.143
I'll stay here and pretend
to help you cook.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.843
Off you go.I'm going. I'm going.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.323
You know you could
actually help me cook.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.890
Jada just texted.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.457
I'm gonna head there now.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.241
Be careful.
It's entirely likely

11:17.285 --> 11:20.244
they're onto you already,
and you're walking into a trap.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.899
Text me if you need to.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.684
Calling my name
may raise suspicion.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.773
Don't worry, Harry.
No one wants to take

11:26.816 --> 11:28.949
these bitches down
more than I do.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.733
Coquito.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.388
Believe it or not,
it's better than eggnog.

11:33.431 --> 11:36.565
The secret, I'm told,
is the coconut.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.180
You're not
on heavy painkillers, are you?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.791
No, I'm good.
Hand it over.

a storm, so don't even think

No, I'm just running an errand.
Uh, Maggie's in the kitchen.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
Thanks.All right.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.748
PARKER:
Hey.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.662
Hey.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.403
Merry Christmas.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.537
Oh, I got this for you.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.887
Thank you.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.410
I'm gonna go put it

Uh, you don't
want to open it now?

12:41.499 --> 12:44.024
Oh, we, um, we open presents
at midnight.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.288
It's what we
did with my mom.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.160
I was just... I got excited
about showing it to you now.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.510
You know what, screw it.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.077
I'm too excited.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.170
Oh, wow.I found it at this,
uh, vintage shop.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.434
It's beautiful.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.655
Here, let me help.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.581
I love it.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.149
Thank you.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.628
And this is

13:23.672 --> 13:25.456
for your dad.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.807
I know you said
he's in Japan for the year.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.027
It's a chess set inspired by
the Japanese netsuke carvings.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.290
So thoughtful.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.031
I don't deserve you.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.207
Too perfect.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.167
Are you okay?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.690
You look a
little pale.

Uh, I'm all right.

In blood and spirit,
join with us.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.097
In blood and spirit,

14:41.141 --> 14:42.446
join with us.

14:47.147 --> 14:50.280
Welcome to the Sisters
of the Arcana.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.260
MEL:
Jada said

15:13.303 --> 15:14.522
the crows do their bidding.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.524
The Sarcana control them.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.353
There were crows in the house
the night Mom died.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.311
Hmm.Mom and the other Elders

15:21.355 --> 15:23.618
that were killed all had
that tree branch pattern.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.054
It's consistent
with the scarring left

15:25.098 --> 15:26.534
from Jada's power.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.449
It all points to her.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.711
So the crows were

15:29.754 --> 15:31.713
accomplices

15:31.756 --> 15:34.498
Something like that.
I'll have to keep looking.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.152
No, it's a good
working theory, Mel.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.545
I can't believe this.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.155
We might finally
know what happened.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.504
Harry.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.899
What...?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.335
:
What on Earth are you doing?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.381
You're supposed to be
keeping Galvin company

15:47.424 --> 15:49.078
while I'm in the kitchen.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.906
Macy, he's
very happy.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.429
Look, look.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.957
You see? He's with

15:58.000 --> 15:59.741
your sister and her beau.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.963
Fine. I'll get him
another coquito.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.584
Hey, are you okay?

16:16.627 --> 16:19.195
Uh, I'm fine.
Um, could I just get some water?

16:20.501 --> 16:21.458
:
We need to talk.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.026
MEL:
Are you sure?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.550
Yes, I'm sure.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.639
When the mark flashed,
he winced,

16:28.683 --> 16:30.032
like it was
hurting him.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.600
Okay.
But we have to be sure.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.818
We can't just
go tell Maggie

16:33.862 --> 16:36.038
that we think her boyfriend
might be a...

16:36.082 --> 16:38.301
I don't even know
what he could be.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.781
Not a demon, right?

16:39.824 --> 16:42.566
I should call Mama Roz.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.264
She seems to be the expert
on these things, and...

16:45.743 --> 16:47.223
You go keep an eye on Parker?

16:47.267 --> 16:49.095
Okay.

16:51.662 --> 16:55.057
If this is true, this is bad.
And very dangerous.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.624
MACY:
Dangerous?

16:56.667 --> 16:57.886
What do you mean?

16:57.929 --> 16:59.409
The more the evil magic

16:59.453 --> 17:01.542
is within one,

17:01.585 --> 17:03.544
the more the mark
will repel them.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.980
If the mark is causing

17:05.024 --> 17:06.590
pain to this being...

17:06.634 --> 17:08.766
Then the intentions are evil.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.857
Okay, thanks.
Thanks, Mama Roz.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.305
What the hell?
Is this really necessary?

17:25.348 --> 17:28.656
You asked for help.
I did what needed to be done.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.919
Really bad luck to run into one
of those protection marks, bro.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.703
What are the odds?

17:32.747 --> 17:35.097
Listen, the amulet
still needs to power up.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.751
In the meantime,
I'll get rid of that mark,

17:36.794 --> 17:38.753
and get the time witch
off your case.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.277
How are you gonna do that?

17:53.724 --> 17:55.770
Get back in there, bro.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.685
Your girlfriend's probably
waiting for you.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.863
I'll be there in a sec.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.527
Hmm.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.236
I can't wait

18:27.280 --> 18:29.108
to spend Christmas with you,

18:29.151 --> 18:31.110
my beloved sisters.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.068
Ugh.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.333
I'm gonna have to work on that.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.859
Oh!

18:45.254 --> 18:46.821
Oh...

18:46.864 --> 18:48.214
Oh.

18:51.042 --> 18:54.394
Kitten heel. Fun.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.265
MEL:
Macy. What the hell?

18:56.309 --> 18:58.398
That was so loud
I just told everyone

18:58.441 --> 19:00.400
that a raccoon must have
knocked something over.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.577
Let's hope Galvin and Parker
bought it. Are you okay?

19:03.620 --> 19:06.014
Yeah. I don't-I don't
know what happened.

19:06.057 --> 19:10.018
Oh, my God. Do you think
it was Galvin's mark?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.020
It must be.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.154
So you were right-- it really
doesn't want you two together.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.417
Totally.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.723
So what did Mama Roz say?
About the mark?

19:19.767 --> 19:22.378
Did she say
why it shocked Parker?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.598
She said it's malfunctioning.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.383
That must be
why it blew me back.

19:27.427 --> 19:28.776
Malfunctioning?

19:28.819 --> 19:30.430
That doesn't make
any sense.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.867
It's a protection ward from
his grandmother, not a toaster.

19:32.910 --> 19:36.436
You know, Mama Roz was getting
pretty snotty about it.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.351
She said his grandmother
probably made a mistake.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.353
But the good news is

19:40.396 --> 19:42.181
she gave me a spell
to remove the mark.

19:42.224 --> 19:45.358
Now that it's not working,
it's pretty dangerous.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.055
Do you think that's
what caused his accident?

19:47.098 --> 19:49.057
If I didn't before,
I do now.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.581
So I guess it's just
a coincidence

19:51.625 --> 19:53.540
that Parker winced
when the mark glowed.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.019
Oh.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.370
Parker is as much of a demon
as I am.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.980
Hmm.
Thank God we didn't

19:59.023 --> 20:00.764
go and tell Maggie, huh?

20:00.808 --> 20:01.896
She already thinks
I disapprove

20:01.939 --> 20:03.376
in her choice of men.

20:03.419 --> 20:04.377
Listen, bring me a drink
for Galvin.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.422
I need it to do the spell over.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.597
You'll have to be the one
to give it to him

20:07.641 --> 20:09.338
to remove the mark,
since I can't set foot

20:09.382 --> 20:10.644
in the house right now.

20:10.687 --> 20:14.691
So, let's do that,
because it's cold out here,

20:14.735 --> 20:17.259
and I can't wait to spend
Christmas with my sisters.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.435
Aw...
I know.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.531
[gentle music plays
in background]

20:28.575 --> 20:30.968
All done?Yeah.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.754
Uh, you're not gonna try to give
me any more of this, are you?

20:33.797 --> 20:35.669
I mean, look what
they did to your boy.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.807
MEL:
So, I think it worked.

20:43.851 --> 20:44.982
He drank the whole thing.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.854
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.117
Snuggle up to my man,
see how close I can get.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.684
Let's hope this ends

20:50.727 --> 20:52.729
in a little stocking stuffing,
am I right?

20:52.773 --> 20:54.775
You're not seriously
thinking about

20:54.818 --> 20:56.037
losing your virginity to him.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.821
Tonight?

20:57.865 --> 20:59.780
I'm... I'm kidding.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.565
Oh. You were so convincing.

21:06.743 --> 21:07.788
A virgin?

21:07.831 --> 21:10.138
Seriously?

21:13.750 --> 21:15.622
Pass me one of them.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.014
Thanks.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.713
Hi.

21:22.585 --> 21:23.630
Hey.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.022
Where you been all day?

21:25.066 --> 21:27.460
Someone's had some eggnog.No, actually,

21:27.503 --> 21:31.725
it's called coqu...
um, co...

21:31.768 --> 21:36.251
It's called something,
but it is muy fuerte.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.819
Mm-hmm.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.777
This is nice.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.866
Yeah, um,

21:42.910 --> 21:45.478
I don't-I don't think we've
been this close before.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.482
N-No. Well-well...

21:49.525 --> 21:51.310
first time for everything.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.314
Hmm.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.056
This is, uh...

21:59.100 --> 22:01.320
Cheesy? Yeah.
Mel hates it.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.147
She wouldn't even let me
put the whole thing up.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.236
I get it.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.542
All the figurines
are super white,

22:06.586 --> 22:07.891
playing traditional
gender roles.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.546
But it's from my dad.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.896
He used to give me a new
building every year.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.681
It's nice, not cheesy.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.422
Yeah.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.858
Hopefully he gets here soon.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.604
Parker?
You're sounding worse.

22:24.647 --> 22:25.866
Did you bring your medication?

22:25.909 --> 22:28.651
Actually, I'm supposed
to start a new regimen.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.914
Something experimental.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.873
It could cure me.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.614
Really?

22:34.657 --> 22:37.225
Well, that's...But there are side effects.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.706
I could feel like
a different person.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.404
That sounds horrible.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.406
But it's a cure?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.843
That's what they say.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.802
So, of course, my family
wants me to do it.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.847
Well, that's because
they love you.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.414
They want to save you.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.981
What about what I want?

22:54.024 --> 22:55.852
They never ask.

22:55.896 --> 22:56.810
I know they love me,
I just--

22:56.853 --> 22:58.812
I wish they would listen to me.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.815
I will always listen.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.730
I know.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.386
Hey, Maggie,
the plantains are ready.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.865
Okay.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.000
Let me go get you some water.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.964
Hey, so...

23:21.008 --> 23:22.923
Yeah, I'll get to
the plantains in a sec.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.403
Not that.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.622
Uh, the necklace
that Parker gave you,

23:26.666 --> 23:28.189
did he say where he got it?

23:28.232 --> 23:31.235
Um, some vintage store. Why?

23:32.367 --> 23:34.151
Just curious.

23:35.805 --> 23:36.937
You're never just curious.

23:36.980 --> 23:42.029
Just... I saw it
change color. Look.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.902
Oh.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.208
It's probably just
a mood necklace.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.124
What?

23:50.167 --> 23:53.214
I really didn't want to have
to tell you this, but earlier,

23:53.257 --> 23:55.869
Macy thought the Yoruba mark
affected Parker.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.827
It started flashing red
when he went near it,

23:57.871 --> 24:00.439
and now the necklace?

24:00.482 --> 24:01.440
What, exactly, are you saying?

24:01.483 --> 24:03.659
You think my boyfriend
is a demon,

24:03.703 --> 24:05.879
and my Christmas gift is evil?

24:05.922 --> 24:09.448
What Macy saw really
freaked her out.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.449
She even called Mama Roz.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.102
And what did Mama Roz say?

24:12.146 --> 24:15.236
That the mark was
malfunctioning.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.933
So, why are we even
talking about this?

24:16.977 --> 24:18.892
I just got a really
weird feeling right now.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.503
The way he was looking
at the necklace.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.027
You got a weird feeling,
and that's enough to tell me

24:24.071 --> 24:25.899
you think I'm so stupid
I wouldn't notice

24:25.942 --> 24:28.728
my boyfriend is evil?

24:28.771 --> 24:30.643
I am an empath.
I think I would know

24:30.686 --> 24:31.948
if there were something
going on with Parker.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.561
I've been reading
his thoughts for weeks.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.911
I know I can trust him.
Fine.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.739
Forget I said anything.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.523
No, you can't just do that
and then say, "Forget about it."

24:44.831 --> 24:46.354
It's Dad.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.964
He can't make it.

24:49.313 --> 24:52.055
Congratulations, Mel.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.970
You get to be right.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.799
I'm just as dumb and naive
as you think I am.
Maggie...

24:56.843 --> 24:59.019
Come on.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.763
Here.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.112
PARKER:
Maggie, slow down.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.593
Everything okay?

25:07.636 --> 25:09.812
I got it.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.240
PARKER:
Hey.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.984
I should be used
to it by now.

25:51.027 --> 25:54.422
Mel's right, he does
this all the time.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.034
Maybe I am too trusting.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.080
Hey, don't say that.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.741
Is this, like, a mood necklace?

26:10.394 --> 26:12.353
It is.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.615
I didn't mention that?

26:13.659 --> 26:16.139
No.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.579
I can trust you, right?

26:21.884 --> 26:25.148
Maggie, yeah, of course.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.978
Okay, good.

26:29.022 --> 26:33.548
I'm kind of putting it all
out there with you, and...

26:33.592 --> 26:35.681
I just don't think
I could take it if...

26:40.816 --> 26:43.253
I know.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.870
I will never hurt you, Maggie.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.270
I will never hurt you, Maggie.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.411
He pulled that necklace right
off her neck, and it changed

27:10.454 --> 27:11.978
back to white right away;
it was weird.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.588
He took the necklace off?

27:13.632 --> 27:17.070
I'm gonna wake Harry up

27:17.113 --> 27:18.811
and see if he knows
anything about an amulet.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.683
And I'll keep an eye on Parker.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.554
Okay.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.490
Hey, bro.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.492
Damn it, Hunter.

27:48.536 --> 27:52.714
Your human side
is so skittish. It's adorbs.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.498
You'd be better off without it.
You know that, right?

27:54.542 --> 27:57.719
Yeah, I know.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.982
You're lying.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.723
You took off the amulet.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.986
You idiot.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.596
Do you know what
you're throwing away?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.773
Listen to me.
This is about

28:07.816 --> 28:09.383
turning you into the Source.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.690
What?
Yeah.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.082
You can be a king.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.389
The Source of All Evil.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.782
Dad believes that's
your destiny.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.392
Dad wants me to be the Source?

28:18.435 --> 28:21.090
Dad didn't think you were ready,
because you're still human.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.092
But once we destroy
your human side,

28:23.136 --> 28:24.703
you'll be so much better.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.923
You won't have to worry about
emotions making you weak.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.665
So put the amulet back on her.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.451
You can be free.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.236
Don't you want that?

28:39.674 --> 28:43.156
Yeah, I do.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.291
HARRY:
It's the, uh,

28:48.335 --> 28:51.730
Amulet of the, uh, Archangel...

28:51.773 --> 28:53.122
Oh, bloody hell, my head.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.733
That infernal coquito.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.299
According to this...Yes?

28:56.343 --> 28:58.911
some saint-- Dragos--
has been wearing the amulet

28:58.954 --> 29:00.956
on his corpse
at a church in Bucharest.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.003
But originally,
the fallen archangel Belial

29:04.046 --> 29:08.224
used it to steal the powers
of all the other archangels.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.361
Parker is trying
to steal our powers.

29:14.404 --> 29:15.623
Impressive.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.364
It's the perfect plan.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.540
He gives his ingenue
a beautiful gift,

29:19.583 --> 29:21.455
and it siphons
the family powers.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.240
Oh, God, poor Maggie.
He targeted her.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.981
She always sees
the best in people.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.809
This will crush her.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.942
Maggie, I need to talk to you.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.031
Now? We're about to eat.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.946
This can't wait.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.817
Is everything okay?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.688
You're scaring me.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.995
GALVIN: Hey, Parker,
could you give me a hand?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.388
I need to hit the bathroom.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.085
All those drinks are finally
catching up to me.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.696
Sure. I'll be right back.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.176
Promise me
you won't go anywhere.

29:47.220 --> 29:50.005
Okay.

29:56.446 --> 29:59.058
Macy, where's Maggie?
She's in trouble.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.102
What?

30:01.887 --> 30:04.846
Harry! I need you.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.893
You're calling me for help,
but you're right here,

30:07.936 --> 30:09.895
which means...

30:11.113 --> 30:13.028
Oh, no.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.791
Night night, Whitelighter.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.836
Harry!

30:48.759 --> 30:51.327
You were just, uh...A little help here?

30:56.419 --> 30:59.509
Harry, are you okay?
What happened?

30:59.553 --> 31:02.512
Blimey, that strumpet nearly
made me soil my knickers.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.037
Why do you suddenly sound
even more British than usual?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.517
Because he's not Harry,
he's a shape-shifter.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.088
Hunter, no!

31:13.132 --> 31:15.047
Parker? How do you...

31:17.963 --> 31:20.052
Two Maggies?
Two Maggies!

31:20.095 --> 31:22.663
Fake me!She's the demon!
Kill her!

31:33.630 --> 31:34.936
No!

31:49.211 --> 31:51.039
You were gonna kill me.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.607
Dad was right. You are too soft.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.174
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.045
You never did.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.711
Can't...

32:10.754 --> 32:12.365
hold me... forever.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.374
No. No. No, it can't be.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.090
Maggie.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.049
It's you.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.965
You're the
Shadow Demon?

32:49.619 --> 32:51.534
Please, let me explain.

32:52.796 --> 32:53.580
HARRY:
Parker, no.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.755
MACY:
Maggie.

33:12.077 --> 33:16.037
I can't believe this.
You're a demon?

33:16.081 --> 33:18.257
I wanted to tell you.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.563
I tried to tell
you before...

33:20.607 --> 33:22.000
Please don't
be scared of me.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.611
Look, I made a mistake.
Let me make it up to you.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.791
You think destroying that's
gonna make it up to me?

33:32.271 --> 33:34.708
What was that for

33:34.751 --> 33:38.712
It was to drain
your powers.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.235
I can't believe this.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.628
But I couldn't
go through with it.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.065
Look, I didn't have a choice.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.460
I was born half-demon,
half-human.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.550
So everything we had
was a disgusting lie?

33:50.593 --> 33:52.160
You used me, you manipulated me.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.554
Please, Maggie.

33:54.597 --> 33:57.078
You promised
you wouldn't hurt me.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.906
I even heard it
in your thoughts.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.864
What? Were you...

34:00.908 --> 34:03.650
Were you faking those?Maggie.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.131
What you and I have,
it is real.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.352
Please.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.354
I love, I love you.

34:12.398 --> 34:17.055
Just stay away from me.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.561
What are you doing here?

36:12.605 --> 36:16.435
You're our new recruit.
Wanted to see if you were okay.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.001
Your very first night with us,

36:18.045 --> 36:20.134
you need protection
from our crows?

36:21.614 --> 36:24.834
You Charmed Ones,
next-level extra.

36:24.878 --> 36:28.142
So you sent them to help us?I told you,

36:28.186 --> 36:29.926
they do our bidding.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.928
They tried to help your mother,
too, you know.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.367
What?

36:35.410 --> 36:37.107
You know, they came
the night she died,

36:37.151 --> 36:40.676
but they failed, obviously.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.461
Whoever killed her

36:42.504 --> 36:44.027
was pretty damn powerful.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.987
But don't worry, we'll
help you find out who.

36:47.030 --> 36:51.078
Anyway, gonna take off.

36:52.732 --> 36:55.213
We'll be in touch.

37:07.094 --> 37:10.184
I've got big plans
for you, Vera.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.370
Guys, we drank
all the coquito.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.764
HUNTER:
Ho, ho, ho.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.287
Merry Christmas.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.290
You've been very
naughty girls this year.

37:29.334 --> 37:32.380
Santa's gonna make you pay.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.212
They're not the ones
who are gonna pay.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.867
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.174
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.526
Little brother,
you will pay for this.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.049
Temelechus...

37:49.092 --> 37:51.399
Poor...

37:51.443 --> 37:55.185
sick, weak Parker.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.927
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.801
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

38:03.193 --> 38:06.196
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.157
ALL:
Temelechus, deschide poarta.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.118

38:17.338 --> 38:18.905

38:19.558 --> 38:21.734

38:46.585 --> 38:50.502
