Well, my mom died when we were
pretty young, and my dad had a

hard time taking care of me and
my brother, so I kinda stepped

43:37.702 --> 43:39.791

I see these guys,
and they're running down

44:26.620 --> 44:28.230
the side of the
road. And I knew

44:28.274 --> 44:30.842
they were up to something. So I
tailed them with the lights off

shoot them. So anyway, they

saw my car, and they took off
across the graveyard with like,

44:53.212 --> 44:56.868
five containers of worms. So
I gave chase on foot. And

44:56.911 --> 45:05.746
most importantly, I out ran 'em.
I beat 'em. Yup, I still got it.
