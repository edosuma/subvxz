to remember something.</i>

00:17.572 --> 00:20.106
Glee Club is not
about competition.

00:20.141 --> 00:22.242
It's about something deeper.

00:22.276 --> 00:27.047
Glee is about
opening yourself up to joy.

00:28.082 --> 00:30.317
ALL:
Whoa...!

00:33.054 --> 00:34.721
It's time.

00:37.391 --> 00:39.392
(sighs)

00:41.395 --> 00:43.363
Can't remember the last time
I was this nervous.

00:43.397 --> 00:45.365
Oh, well, you don't
look nervous at all.

00:45.399 --> 00:46.700
You look great.

00:46.734 --> 00:48.702
Are you ready?

Yeah.

Would you mind
saying that again?

02:30.705 --> 02:32.345
I-I'm not sure
I understood you correctly.

02:32.373 --> 02:35.342
The District Board of
Education has decided

02:35.376 --> 02:37.477
to make McKinley an arts school.

02:37.512 --> 02:38.812
In a very short time from now,

02:38.846 --> 02:40.146
you and I will be standing

02:40.181 --> 02:42.149
in the choir room

02:42.183 --> 02:43.850
of the William McKinley
High School

02:43.885 --> 02:45.385
for the Performing Arts.

02:45.419 --> 02:46.987
Wh-Wh-What happened?

02:47.021 --> 02:49.322
To be completely honest, Will,

02:49.357 --> 02:50.357
you happened.

02:50.358 --> 02:52.325
Over the last decade,

02:52.360 --> 02:54.327
school districts across the
country have been facing

02:54.362 --> 02:55.495
multi-million dollar
budget shortfalls.

02:55.530 --> 02:56.830
Yeah.

02:56.864 --> 02:58.832
And our quick fix was

02:58.866 --> 03:00.834
eliminating arts
programs altogether.

03:00.868 --> 03:02.836
Prioritizing what we
would hope would be

03:02.870 --> 03:06.239
more essential subjects
like math, reading, science.

03:06.274 --> 03:07.374
You know what?

03:07.408 --> 03:08.742
We were wrong.

03:08.776 --> 03:10.177
Scores did not go up.

03:10.211 --> 03:12.012
In fact, in some places,
they got worse.

03:12.046 --> 03:16.249
But you... you refused
to let that stop you.

03:16.284 --> 03:19.186
And I decided it was time
for me to stick my neck out

03:19.220 --> 03:22.088
and make a pitch to the board.

03:22.123 --> 03:25.892
And to my great surprise,
they agreed with me.

03:27.461 --> 03:30.497
Superintendent Harris, I mean...
this is incredible news.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.467
Please, please,
if-if there's anything

03:33.501 --> 03:35.635
I can do to help,
just-just let me know.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.771
What are you talking about?

03:37.805 --> 03:40.285
I'm gonna have you
run the school.

03:41.409 --> 03:42.742
Uh, I beg your pardon?

03:42.777 --> 03:44.110
I'm making you principal, Will.

03:46.581 --> 03:47.914
Congratulations.

03:53.921 --> 03:55.655
WILL:
Okay.

03:55.690 --> 03:57.424
Wait, now, remember.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.758
What? That cookie
is for dessert.

03:58.793 --> 04:00.093
Oh, come on.
Okay?

04:00.128 --> 04:02.095
That is not an appetizer,
all right?

04:02.130 --> 04:04.064
Now that you're the principal,
you have to set

04:04.098 --> 04:06.066
a good nutritional example
for the other teachers...

04:06.100 --> 04:08.001
I don't know if I can
live up to that standard.

04:08.035 --> 04:09.955
You're just gonna have
to come have lunch with me

04:09.971 --> 04:10.971
every single day.

04:10.972 --> 04:11.972
Oh, my goodness, Will.

04:11.973 --> 04:13.673
Will...!
(laughing)

04:13.708 --> 04:16.243
We have to do everything
possible to be appropriate

04:16.277 --> 04:19.079
and professional now
that you are management.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.113
(sighs deeply)

04:20.148 --> 04:21.748
I am never gonna have to worry

04:21.783 --> 04:24.351
about getting funding
for another Glee Club costume

04:24.385 --> 04:27.320
or paint brushes or tap shoes
for a kid who can't afford them.

04:27.355 --> 04:31.992
Our son will be in the day care
that we set up in the gym.

04:32.026 --> 04:34.528
And my beautiful wife

04:34.562 --> 04:35.829
will be right down the hall,

04:35.863 --> 04:37.864
working tirelessly to help kids

04:37.899 --> 04:40.434
get into the best arts
colleges in the world.

04:40.468 --> 04:42.068
Oh, my goodness.

04:44.138 --> 04:46.106
I'm so proud of you, Will.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.443
It has been quite a journey
to get to this place.

04:49.477 --> 04:53.380
And you've made it the whole way
without losing your integrity.

04:53.414 --> 04:55.148
Except for those days
when you were rapping.

04:55.183 --> 04:57.184
(laughs)

04:59.520 --> 05:02.000
Can I be honest with
you about something?

05:04.258 --> 05:05.592
I am scared to death.

05:07.562 --> 05:10.697
Do I have the talent
to actually do the job?

05:10.731 --> 05:13.667
Will, you're the most
talented man in the world.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.836
Or at least in Ohio.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.037
That's more like it.

05:17.071 --> 05:18.839
(chuckling):
Right.

05:18.873 --> 05:21.374
I'm serious... you don't have
anything to be scared about.

05:21.409 --> 05:24.411
I'm not saying that
it's gonna be easy,

05:24.445 --> 05:27.080
but I am saying now is
the time for you and I

05:27.115 --> 05:29.082
to relax and have fun...

05:29.117 --> 05:30.117
Yeah.

05:30.118 --> 05:32.419
...and be in
love, right?

05:32.453 --> 05:35.088
Because if we don't like
something now, we can...

05:35.123 --> 05:38.091
you know, we can fix it.

05:38.126 --> 05:39.760
So no more bad guys.

05:39.794 --> 05:42.696
It is just you and me

05:42.730 --> 05:45.699
and the power of
our imaginations.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.370
I love you so much.

05:50.405 --> 05:52.906
I love you.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.408
Now go get
your son, Mr. Shue,

05:54.442 --> 05:55.909
and I will see you at school.

05:55.943 --> 05:57.110
(sighs) All right.

06:03.785 --> 06:05.752
You see that, Danny?

06:05.787 --> 06:08.255
Dreams really do come true.

06:08.289 --> 06:09.589
Yeah.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.625
(chuckles)

06:14.962 --> 06:16.930
Here he is!

06:16.964 --> 06:18.799
(cheering, whooping)

06:30.478 --> 06:32.446
Wow, um...

06:32.480 --> 06:34.448
I have to say this is
the most exciting first day

06:34.482 --> 06:36.450
of Glee Club
that we have ever had.

06:36.484 --> 06:38.452
No offense to the alumni
who have been here

06:38.486 --> 06:40.787
since the very first-ever
Glee Club meeting.

06:40.822 --> 06:42.122
(sighs)

06:42.156 --> 06:44.124
All right, please,
everyone, have a seat.

06:44.158 --> 06:45.992
(clears throat)

06:46.027 --> 06:49.262
So, Mr. Shue when are you
gonna start auditions?

06:49.297 --> 06:50.731
KURT: Yeah, I think you're
gonna have trouble sticking

06:50.765 --> 06:52.499
to your whole "whoever wants in,
gets in" rule.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.101
Not true, Mr. Hummel.

06:54.135 --> 06:55.669
The New Directions!
will be only one

06:55.703 --> 06:57.237
of the glee clubs
at this school.

06:57.271 --> 06:59.239
I'm bringing back
the Troubletones

06:59.273 --> 07:01.808
and starting an all-boys version
called the Duly Noted.

07:01.843 --> 07:04.144
And we're also gonna have
a junior varsity squad

07:04.178 --> 07:06.446
for those who feel like they
need a little seasoning

07:06.481 --> 07:08.248
before they're ready
for the big time.

07:08.282 --> 07:10.984
So, wait, how are you gonna
teach all those glee clubs

07:11.018 --> 07:12.319
and run a school?

07:12.353 --> 07:13.587
I'm not.

07:13.621 --> 07:15.155
I'm actually not coaching
any of them.

07:15.189 --> 07:16.490
Not even the New Directions?

07:16.524 --> 07:19.326
Well, uh, I've interviewed a...

07:19.360 --> 07:21.520
a candidate for that particular
job that I really like.

07:21.529 --> 07:23.096
But until then,

07:23.131 --> 07:27.134
I wanted to say farewell
to you all

07:27.168 --> 07:29.836
with a song that I prepared
for this occasion.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.174
My life changed...

07:34.208 --> 07:37.511
because of all the magic
that we created in this room.

07:37.545 --> 07:39.513
And if I've learned one thing,

07:39.547 --> 07:41.627
it's the message in the lyrics
of this song.

07:46.154 --> 07:48.355
This is for you guys.

(grunting):
Come on... a little...

10:36.812 --> 10:38.780
Hey, what are you doing?

10:38.814 --> 10:41.783
Oh, uh, just a little inventory.

10:41.817 --> 10:44.452
We got to do it
before we sell all this stuff.

10:44.487 --> 10:47.455
I mean, all these balls are
under one PSI, so...

10:47.490 --> 10:49.291
they're basically, uh, useless

10:49.325 --> 10:51.125
unless we fill them up
to 12.5.

10:53.062 --> 10:54.396
So listen, um,

10:54.430 --> 10:57.365
considering that you're
going to be unemployed

10:57.400 --> 10:59.368
somewhat soon, I was wondering

10:59.402 --> 11:01.270
you'd given
any thought to maybe,

11:01.304 --> 11:03.172
I don't know,
moving back to New York.

11:03.206 --> 11:05.441
We have this spare room
for you... it-it's perfect.

11:05.475 --> 11:07.576
It's really small; it's more of,
like, a closet, really, but...

11:07.611 --> 11:08.744
Uh, yeah.

11:08.779 --> 11:10.012
No, we talked about this before.

11:10.046 --> 11:11.547
I told you that
New York's not my speed.

11:11.581 --> 11:12.615
It's too fast; it's too loud;

11:12.649 --> 11:14.250
there's too many sports teams,

11:14.284 --> 11:15.951
so I get confused on who I'm
supposed to root for.

11:15.986 --> 11:18.120
We just root
for whichever one's winning.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.089
Okay, that's something
Kurt would say.

11:20.123 --> 11:21.991
That's what happens
when you get married.

11:23.426 --> 11:25.895
Kurt and I are
really happy, all right?

11:25.929 --> 11:28.464
That's good. W-We're having
a very good life together.

11:28.498 --> 11:30.266
We see everybody...
We see Rachel,

11:30.300 --> 11:32.268
we see Artie, Brittany,
Santana, Kitty...

11:32.302 --> 11:35.137
It's a lot of fun,
but I miss my best friend.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.139
Dude, I miss you,
too, man, you know?

11:37.174 --> 11:39.575
But this is home, okay?

11:39.609 --> 11:41.477
I need to be out in
the wide-open spaces.

11:41.511 --> 11:43.479
I need to be able to just
go out on the weekends

11:43.513 --> 11:44.833
and just shoot
stuff if I want to.

11:44.848 --> 11:46.482
Look, I'm happy.

11:46.516 --> 11:49.485
I am genuinely happy here, okay?

11:49.519 --> 11:51.587
This is where I'm meant to be.

11:51.621 --> 11:54.657
I just don't want you
to waste all of your talent.

11:54.691 --> 11:57.993
I'm not... I'm using all of
my talent in my new job.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.499
All right.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.501
Congratulations to all of you.

12:05.535 --> 12:08.504
You have been selected
as the best of the best.

12:08.538 --> 12:12.208
You are this year's
New Directions!

12:16.880 --> 12:19.849
Now I would like to introduce
you all to your new teacher,

12:19.883 --> 12:21.884
Mr. Sam Evans.

12:24.554 --> 12:25.855
Wait, hold on, no.

12:25.889 --> 12:27.189
Y-You're taking over
the glee club?

12:27.224 --> 12:28.224
Jealous?

12:28.225 --> 12:29.792
Yeah.

12:29.826 --> 12:32.128
I could not be more proud
to pass the baton off to you.

12:33.296 --> 12:34.363
Go get 'em, buddy.

12:34.398 --> 12:36.699
All right, all right, all right.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.367
So look,
I've been thinking a lot

12:38.402 --> 12:40.002
about the first week's lesson.

12:40.036 --> 12:42.705
This week, your assignment is...

12:47.077 --> 12:49.044
...country!

12:50.013 --> 12:51.147
Uh-oh.

12:51.181 --> 12:52.515
Let's see
where he goes with this.

12:52.549 --> 12:55.518
Country and blues come
from the same roots.

12:55.552 --> 12:57.019
The hardship of a rural life.

12:57.054 --> 13:00.689
Country uses little
personal stories

13:00.724 --> 13:02.691
about breakups or
broken-down pickups

13:02.726 --> 13:05.962
to express the deeper pains
of poverty and anxiety

13:05.996 --> 13:09.966
that was in still, uh, such a
normal part of life

13:10.000 --> 13:12.302
in the American South.

13:12.336 --> 13:15.305
Now, if we want to be great,

13:15.339 --> 13:18.375
we need to be able
to sing about hurt and loss.

13:18.409 --> 13:20.210
And even if we can't
relate to the specifics,

13:20.244 --> 13:21.845
make them our own.

13:21.879 --> 13:25.315
So who wants to start us off
with a country song?

13:25.349 --> 13:27.349
Let's do "She Thinks
My Tractor's Sexy."

13:27.351 --> 13:29.352
(others enthusiastically agree)

13:29.387 --> 13:30.387
MAN:
Yeah.

13:30.388 --> 13:32.022
WOMAN:
Okay.

13:32.056 --> 13:35.025
Well, looks like we're all
right where we belong.

13:35.059 --> 13:37.539
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

13:38.229 --> 13:39.929
MERCEDES:
Okay, wait.

13:39.964 --> 13:41.865
Stop right there.

13:41.899 --> 13:43.533
I just want you guys
to come in and listen,

13:43.567 --> 13:45.735
because I have to get
through this without crying.

13:49.874 --> 13:53.176
Okay, I have officially
been picked up

13:53.210 --> 13:55.845
to be the opening act
for Beyoncé's new world tour.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.447
(gasping, all talking excitedly)

13:57.481 --> 13:59.321
MERCEDES:
Effective immediately.

13:59.950 --> 14:01.885
- Yay!
- MERCEDES: I know.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.255
You know,
ever since I've been back,

14:05.289 --> 14:06.856
I've just been
walking these halls,

14:06.891 --> 14:09.859
trying to remember
how invisible I used to feel.

14:09.894 --> 14:12.195
And the funny thing is...

14:12.229 --> 14:15.098
It's getting really hard
to remember that Mercedes.

14:15.132 --> 14:16.866
Even when I got
the call earlier,

14:16.901 --> 14:19.536
I didn't think, "Oh, this must
be some kind of mistake,"

14:19.570 --> 14:22.539
or, you know,
"They must not mean me."

14:22.573 --> 14:24.774
That's because of you guys.

14:24.809 --> 14:26.776
Having friends like you
really did change me.

14:26.811 --> 14:29.813
You made me know
that good things are possible.

14:33.484 --> 14:37.620
It's not really... it's not
really that common to come by...

14:37.655 --> 14:39.656
and I'll remember you guys
for it.

14:40.992 --> 14:42.826
No, no, no, no,
do not come up here,

14:42.860 --> 14:44.427
because that is not
even the hard part,

14:44.462 --> 14:47.097
and if you come up here now,
I am gonna lose it,

14:47.131 --> 14:49.666
and I am determined to walk out
of here with some class.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.235
So, between

14:52.269 --> 14:57.907
the tour and rehearsals and
me cutting an album right after,

14:57.942 --> 15:01.144
I won't be seeing you guys
for a while.

15:01.178 --> 15:04.814
Maybe even a-a long while.

15:04.849 --> 15:08.952
You know, we'll keep in touch,
but it's not gonna be the same,

15:08.986 --> 15:11.588
and I think that we've all had
enough group hugs

15:11.622 --> 15:13.623
that can last us a lifetime.

15:15.192 --> 15:19.629
So, I wanted to say good-bye
my way... with a song.

15:19.664 --> 15:22.866
And then, I want to walk
out of here...

15:22.900 --> 15:27.103
like I'm gonna be seeing
everybody in Glee Club tomorrow,

15:27.138 --> 15:30.507
and like it's not
really good-bye.

Oh, hello, Porcelain.

18:14.774 --> 18:16.208
<i>Mrs.</i> Porcelain.

18:16.242 --> 18:18.444
What are you doing, Sue?

18:18.478 --> 18:20.145
Well, I just came in to, uh,

18:20.180 --> 18:21.914
drink in the old office
one last time,

18:21.948 --> 18:24.917
and to drop a hot one
in the middle of Will's desk.

18:24.951 --> 18:26.452
But that seemed childish, so,

18:26.486 --> 18:28.320
I, uh, just peed everywhere.

18:28.355 --> 18:31.557
Can you have a seat
for-for a second?

18:31.591 --> 18:33.959
We wanted to talk to you.

18:33.994 --> 18:35.561
As you probably already know,

18:35.595 --> 18:38.130
Blaine and I are leaving
for New York in a few days,

18:38.164 --> 18:39.898
but before we leave,

18:39.933 --> 18:42.568
we wanted to thank you for
getting us back together.

18:42.602 --> 18:44.169
If it hadn't been for you,

18:44.204 --> 18:46.405
we would still be apart,
and we would still be miserable.

18:46.439 --> 18:47.940
BLAINE:
So...

18:47.974 --> 18:49.575
thank you.

18:49.609 --> 18:51.510
We really meant it:
thank you.

18:51.544 --> 18:53.579
Porcelain...

18:53.613 --> 18:54.813
(sighs)

18:54.848 --> 18:56.815
The first moment
I laid eyes on you,

18:56.850 --> 19:00.319
I truly didn't understand
what I was looking at.

19:00.353 --> 19:02.287
With your hippo broaches

19:02.322 --> 19:04.123
and your knee-length sweaters,

19:04.157 --> 19:06.925
standing there all sassy
with your arms crossed

19:06.960 --> 19:08.961
and your hips
all... cocked out,

19:08.995 --> 19:12.064
and your eyes rolled back
as if to say, "Oh, how droll."

19:13.199 --> 19:15.167
But then, I got to know you.

19:15.201 --> 19:18.304
And even though
you still constantly annoyed me,

19:18.338 --> 19:21.440
I got to watch you go through
what you went through.

19:21.474 --> 19:23.342
The whole
coming-out thing

19:23.376 --> 19:26.612
with your dad, the death threats
from the bully

19:26.646 --> 19:28.480
whom Blaine later dated.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.449
I never knew

19:30.483 --> 19:32.451
I had thoughts and feelings
about those things

19:32.485 --> 19:34.320
until I watched you
go through them.

19:34.354 --> 19:36.989
But you expanded my mind.

19:37.023 --> 19:39.191
You taught me things
about myself

19:39.225 --> 19:42.061
that I would have never
discovered on my own.

19:43.663 --> 19:45.664
And for that, I thank you.

19:47.033 --> 19:49.034
Thank you.

19:51.071 --> 19:52.905
Blaine...

19:52.939 --> 19:54.907
I still don't really get you.

19:54.941 --> 19:57.843
Um, I guess I just am not
a fan of your thing.

19:57.877 --> 19:59.144
But, hey,

19:59.179 --> 20:01.380
you're doing you...

20:01.414 --> 20:03.182
and that's swell.

20:03.216 --> 20:05.017
Thank you, Sue.

20:05.051 --> 20:06.885
I feel the same way about you.

20:08.421 --> 20:09.888
And now, if you'll excuse me,

20:09.923 --> 20:12.191
there's somebody I need to see.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.234
I was coming to see you!

20:22.269 --> 20:25.604
I was coming to see you, too!

20:47.594 --> 20:48.761
Oh!

20:48.795 --> 20:50.596
Coach, I'm sorry that I said

20:50.630 --> 20:52.765
those horrible things
to a horrible adult.

20:52.799 --> 20:54.533
Oh, honey, I'm the
one who's sorry.

20:54.568 --> 20:56.468
I've been treating you
like an unpaid intern,

20:56.503 --> 20:59.138
when I should have been
treating you like a paid intern.

20:59.172 --> 21:02.041
But honey, there's still one
last person I have to see.

21:02.075 --> 21:03.776
- All right.

of the United States.

23:54.447 --> 23:56.949
With me now, before she heads
down to Times Square

23:56.983 --> 23:59.919
to meet the president and
the crowd of tens of thousands,

23:59.953 --> 24:01.754
the vice president,
Sue Sylvester.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.824
Madam Vice President, thank you
so much for being here.

24:04.858 --> 24:06.091
Well, thank you, Geraldo.

24:06.126 --> 24:07.446
And I just spoke
to the president,

24:07.460 --> 24:08.928
and he was curious
about where I was,

24:08.962 --> 24:10.996
and I told him
that victory rally could wait

24:11.031 --> 24:13.632
until I had a chat
with my old buddy Geraldo.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.334
Now, Madam Vice President,

24:15.368 --> 24:16.936
I have to ask you,

24:16.970 --> 24:19.238
will you be running
for president in 2024?

24:19.272 --> 24:22.408
You bet your sweet ass, Geraldo.

24:22.442 --> 24:25.077
Well, folks, you heard it here
first... the vice president.

24:25.111 --> 24:27.613
Thank you very much.
Congratulations to you.

24:27.647 --> 24:30.382
We'll be back with more election
night coverage right after this.

24:33.151 --> 24:35.586
I wanted to make a time capsule
of my time at McKinley.

24:35.620 --> 24:39.056
I know it's stupid, but it'd give me a
reason to come back every once in a while.

24:39.090 --> 24:40.958
Oh, it's really, really sweet.

24:40.992 --> 24:42.459
I have programs

24:42.493 --> 24:44.461
from our show choir
competitions,

24:44.495 --> 24:46.930
and... and oh, my <i> Rocky</i>
<i>Horror Picture Show</i> wig,

24:46.965 --> 24:49.032
and oh, my Gaga
heels, and, uh...

24:49.067 --> 24:51.702
and, oh, my favorite photo of
Finn, and oh, prom queen crown...

24:51.736 --> 24:55.038
and, oh, our picture from prom, and
the ring you got me that Christmas.

24:55.073 --> 24:57.040
(laughs)

24:57.075 --> 24:58.709
Wh...

24:58.743 --> 25:02.145
Wh-Why are you crying and
laughing at the same time?

25:02.180 --> 25:05.148
(laughs): Because you're
the only person I know

25:05.183 --> 25:07.150
that would do
something like this.

25:07.185 --> 25:08.285
(chuckles)

25:08.319 --> 25:09.553
You're the only one.

I love you so much.

to hear your side.

33:46.641 --> 33:48.708
What in the heck made you say
"yes" to being their surrogate?

33:48.743 --> 33:52.112

story based on how I was raised,

33:52.146 --> 33:54.147
but these guys have just
been so amazing.

36:18.192 --> 36:19.960
And I want to thank my

36:19.994 --> 36:22.929
two dads for all of those
singing and dancing lessons.

36:22.964 --> 36:24.931
Okay, I want to thank...

36:24.966 --> 36:27.000
Carmen Tibideaux at NYADA

36:27.034 --> 36:28.869
for giving me a second chance
at my degree,

36:28.903 --> 36:31.872
and to all of my friends
at McKinley High.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.674
Um, but I want
to dedicate this award

36:34.709 --> 36:37.511
to the person who's responsible

36:37.545 --> 36:39.513
for getting me
on this stage tonight,

36:39.547 --> 36:41.114
and that is Mr. Will Schuester.

36:41.149 --> 36:44.184
Um, Mr. Shue always taught
to my strengths

36:44.218 --> 36:46.119
and not my weaknesses,

36:46.154 --> 36:49.356
and he cheered the loudest
when I soared.

36:49.390 --> 36:51.992
And he picked me up when I was
in a million pieces.

36:52.026 --> 36:55.896
He taught me the one great thing
that all teachers do,

36:55.930 --> 36:58.031
and there are
so many of them out there.

36:58.066 --> 37:00.200
And that is, being a part
of something special

37:00.234 --> 37:01.868
does not make you special.

37:01.903 --> 37:04.204
Something is special
because you are a part of it.

37:04.238 --> 37:05.705
Mr. Shue, I love you so much.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.874
And to all of the boys
and girls out there,

37:07.909 --> 37:10.143
I just want to say quickly
before I walk off the stage,

37:10.178 --> 37:13.880
that dreams really do come true,
so, thank you.

37:13.915 --> 37:15.916
(applause and cheering)

37:23.745 --> 37:25.143
__

37:25.160 --> 37:27.428
Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice
President of the United States.

37:27.462 --> 37:28.629
(school bell ringing)

37:28.663 --> 37:30.664
(applause)

37:34.836 --> 37:36.804
Fantastic.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.340
Becky? Becky?!

37:39.374 --> 37:42.576
It's okay, honey.
He's clean.

37:44.980 --> 37:47.948
You know, a great big fat person
once stood on this stage

37:47.983 --> 37:50.151
and told a group of a dozen
or so nerds

37:50.185 --> 37:52.186
in hideous disco outfits

37:52.220 --> 37:54.822
that "glee,"
by its very definition,

37:54.856 --> 37:57.792
is about opening yourself up
to joy.

37:57.826 --> 38:00.628
Now, it's no secret
that for a long time,

38:00.662 --> 38:02.630
I thought
that was a load of hooey.

38:02.664 --> 38:05.132
As far as I can see,
the glee club is nothing more

38:05.167 --> 38:07.134
than a place where a bunch
of cowardly losers

38:07.169 --> 38:09.303
go to sing their troubles away,

38:09.337 --> 38:11.572
and delude themselves
that they live in a world

38:11.606 --> 38:15.643
that cares one iota
about their hopes and dreams,

38:15.677 --> 38:17.645
totally divorced
from the harsh reality

38:17.679 --> 38:19.747
that out in the the real world,

38:19.781 --> 38:22.583
there's not much more
to hope for than disappointment,

38:22.617 --> 38:25.219
heartbreak and failure.

38:25.253 --> 38:27.154
You know what?

38:27.189 --> 38:32.508
I was exactly right.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.344
But I was wrong
about the cowardly part.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.614
What I finally realize,

38:38.648 --> 38:41.517
now that I'm well
into my late thirties...

38:41.551 --> 38:43.452
It takes

38:43.487 --> 38:46.355
a lot of bravery to look
around you, and see the world,

38:46.390 --> 38:50.459
not as it is,
but as it should be.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.062
A world where the quarterback
becomes best friends

38:53.096 --> 38:55.131
with the gay kid,

38:55.165 --> 38:56.966
and the girl with the big nose
ends up on Broadway.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.403
Glee is about imagining
a world like that,

39:00.437 --> 39:03.906
and finding the courage
to open up your heart

39:03.940 --> 39:06.242
and sing about it.

39:06.276 --> 39:09.211
That's what Glee Club is.

39:09.246 --> 39:12.782
And for the longest time,
I thought that was silly.

39:12.816 --> 39:15.551
And now, I think it's just about
the bravest thing

39:15.585 --> 39:17.620
that anyone could do.

39:20.023 --> 39:23.159
I'm honored to be here
to rededicate this theater

39:23.193 --> 39:25.094
the Finn Hudson Auditorium.

39:29.766 --> 39:33.736
William,
it is with your hard work,

39:33.770 --> 39:36.772
in his memory, that you managed

39:36.807 --> 39:38.908
to accomplish something
unimaginable.

39:38.942 --> 39:41.243
McKinley High School
for the Performing Arts

39:41.278 --> 39:43.312
has become
an overwhelming success,

39:43.347 --> 39:47.516
a model for public schools
that showcase the arts,

39:47.551 --> 39:50.086
now being replicated
all across the country.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.088
(sighs)

39:52.122 --> 39:53.756
Congratulations, Will Schuester.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.658
You and your little Glee Club

39:55.692 --> 39:58.494
have accomplished something
quite remarkable.

39:58.528 --> 40:01.130
And now, without further ado,

40:01.164 --> 40:02.999
it is my pleasure to introduce

40:03.033 --> 40:05.034
