00:29.946 --> 00:32.073
<i>I remember when I was little</i>

00:33.199 --> 00:35.410
<i>I would watch my father.</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:40.457
<i>He was always very passionate.</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:44.753
<i>Always happy and excited.</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:48.965
<i>I liked what my dad did.</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:55.430
<i>I remember lighting the pit.</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:01.061
<i>The smell of the leaves.</i>

01:03.354 --> 01:06.066
<i>My father would slice an orange...</i>

01:09.527 --> 01:11.112
<i>"Open your mouth!"</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.824
<i>And he'd squeeze the orange.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:19.287
<i>I remember the slaughter of the lambs.</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:28.671
<i>I liked learning to cut off their heads,</i>
<i>to skin them.</i>

01:34.010 --> 01:36.888
<i>Those are some</i>
<i>very beautiful memories for me.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:43.436
<i>I'm still rooted in those customs.</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:48.191
<i>But it's been many years</i>
<i>since I've been home.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:53.822
Immigrants know this story all too well.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.454
<i>It's a story of family.</i>

02:02.330 --> 02:03.623
<i>Of separation.</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:08.294
<i>And this is what I would like to change.</i>

02:13.049 --> 02:18.513
<i>I'm not afraid to break something</i>
<i>to make it better.</i>

04:06.204 --> 04:10.625
<i>Lamb barbacoa is a very traditional dish</i>
<i>from Central Mexico.</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.546
<i>It's very difficult to prepare.</i>

04:24.639 --> 04:28.142
It is difficult enough
to find good barbacoa in Mexico.

04:32.814 --> 04:39.529
<i>So, when </i>Bon App√©tit <i>issued its</i>
<i>ten best restaurants in America list</i>

04:40.446 --> 04:44.826
<i>and there was a barbacoa restaurant</i>
<i>in Philadelphia...</i>

04:45.576 --> 04:46.786
It's a crazy idea.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.595
<i>But Cristina Martinez is more than a chef.</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:49.140
<i>Cristina is undocumented.</i>

05:51.809 --> 05:54.395
<i>Cristina was able to</i>
<i>change her circumstances</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:58.566
<i>and become an advocate for immigrants.</i>

06:00.109 --> 06:03.446
By saying that she is
an immigrant so publicly,

06:03.529 --> 06:05.364
<i>she is at risk all the time.</i>

06:56.707 --> 06:58.793
<i>My hometown is Capulhuac, Mexico.</i>

07:02.505 --> 07:05.800
<i>It is known as the capital of barbacoa.</i>

07:18.980 --> 07:24.026
<i>Barbacoa is a tradition</i>
<i>that began a long time ago.</i>

07:27.071 --> 07:31.117
My family has made it from the beginning.

08:01.272 --> 08:05.818
<i>Traditionally,</i>
<i>you make barbacoa in the pit.</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:14.869
<i>Cooking in coals</i>
<i>is the best thing for food.</i>

08:17.747 --> 08:20.374
<i>The barbacoa is made of lamb.</i>

08:20.458 --> 08:23.878
Marinated with orange and salt.

08:29.050 --> 08:34.514
<i>The meat, the feet,</i>
<i>the stomach, the entrails, and the head.</i>

08:35.806 --> 08:38.142
There is nothing that goes to waste.

08:41.270 --> 08:46.359
<i>The orange is needed</i>
<i>to remove the moisture from the lamb.</i>

08:55.326 --> 08:57.203
<i>We use maguey leaves</i>

08:57.286 --> 09:01.374
<i>to infuse it with a bitter flavor</i>
<i>that cannot be duplicated.</i>

09:05.378 --> 09:09.006
<i>You cover them, and then the magic begins.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:16.514
<i>You wait eight hours.</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:28.192
You can see how the barbacoa is breathing.

09:30.486 --> 09:34.532
<i>Vapors rise, and the smell is incredible.</i>

09:38.286 --> 09:43.874
<i>I've been cooking barbacoa</i>
<i>since I was six years old.</i>

09:46.919 --> 09:50.631
<i>And still, when I'm making barbacoa,</i>
<i>I feel something magical.</i>

09:53.551 --> 09:55.553
<i>I rejoice in my heart.</i>

10:10.109 --> 10:13.321
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i>
<i>hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come.</i>

10:13.404 --> 10:16.782
Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.369
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive our trespasses,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.414
as we also forgive
those who trespass against us.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.209
Do not let us fall into temptation.
And deliver us from evil.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.129
God, on this day...

10:31.088 --> 10:34.717
I want to thank you for all the
wonderful things you have given me.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.764
Having our family united
in the name of my sister, Cristina.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.352
Far from us,
but we always carry her in our heart.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.606
Let's eat.

10:57.698 --> 11:02.703
<i>Barbacoa on the weekends is like the</i>
<i>best thing that can happen to a Mexican.</i>

11:03.537 --> 11:05.122
Can I have some salsa?

11:07.708 --> 11:08.959
Whiskey is missing.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.676
It's a very special dish
that you have on Saturdays and Sundays.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.347
<i>You get together with family.</i>

11:22.640 --> 11:25.684
<i>They clear their schedule to be together.</i>

11:28.854 --> 11:31.565
<i>It's an important part of life.</i>

11:42.284 --> 11:45.371
<i>I have not seen my family for eight years.</i>

11:51.710 --> 11:55.631
<i>When I arrived in Philadelphia,</i>
<i>I was very saddened that I couldn't find</i>

11:55.714 --> 11:59.260
this sense of home that is barbacoa.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.433
<i>So now, I am setting an example.</i>

12:07.601 --> 12:10.980
<i>I believe food has power.</i>

12:13.524 --> 12:17.903
<i>I make my food with love,</i>
<i>with strength and with passion.</i>

12:24.660 --> 12:28.706
<i>Through food, we can find home.</i>

12:48.058 --> 12:52.271
<i>Growing up, I had four siblings.</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:57.526
We were always working together.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.030
<i>But we had lots of fun.</i>

13:01.113 --> 13:03.824
<i>My parents always wanted the best for us.</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:08.704
<i>My family was very happy.</i>

13:10.080 --> 13:12.374
And then at 17, I got married.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.050
<i>And I moved to his house.</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:28.599
<i>My husband's family also made barbacoa.</i>

13:30.434 --> 13:32.853
<i>They put me to work.</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:37.441
I was always busy
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.492
<i>Everything had to be cleaned,</i>
<i>chopped and stored.</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:54.083
<i>I'd go to sleep at 10:30 at night.</i>

13:54.166 --> 13:57.294
But at 3:00 in the morning,
I'd have to get up

13:57.378 --> 13:59.755
<i>because I'd have to remove the barbacoa.</i>

14:04.718 --> 14:06.887
<i>That was my job.</i>

14:10.683 --> 14:14.645
I was like an employee, not a wife.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.780
<i>I wasn't allowed to see my family.</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:40.796
<i>When I tried to say</i>
<i>that I did not like it,</i>

14:41.463 --> 14:44.884
<i>he started treating me so much worse.</i>

14:47.678 --> 14:52.016
He told me, "You're no good at anything.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.313
<i>You're not worth anything."</i>

15:01.108 --> 15:04.361
<i>He beat me brutally.</i>

15:09.825 --> 15:14.121
Hitting me every day. Over and over.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.583
<i>I'm screaming.</i>

15:19.001 --> 15:23.631
And his mother says,
"I don't hear anything."

15:26.300 --> 15:28.552
<i>I was never the same again.</i>

15:47.655 --> 15:51.158
<i>After two years of marriage,</i>
<i>Karla is born.</i>

15:51.241 --> 15:53.494
She's a girl. She's a beautiful girl.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.331
<i>And I was very happy.</i>

15:58.207 --> 16:01.627
I knew I wasn't going to be alone.
I will have someone to talk to.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.549
<i>Karla was the joy of my life,</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:12.012
and to this day, lights up my face.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.271
<i>The first 13 years of my life were...</i>

16:22.773 --> 16:24.441
<i>It was a difficult life.</i>

16:26.443 --> 16:31.198
From the age of six,
they started to take us to work.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.379
<i>All week,</i>
<i>we went to school in the morning,</i>

16:45.462 --> 16:48.632
<i>and in the afternoon, we had obligations.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:53.637
<i>It was work and work. Every day.</i>

16:59.309 --> 17:00.644
<i>When I started secondary school,</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:03.439
I told my dad
that I did not want to go sell anymore.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.820
<i>I wanted to dedicate myself</i>
<i>to homework, to school.</i>

17:11.947 --> 17:13.907
<i>My dad said no.</i>

17:17.703 --> 17:21.957
<i>Here, if your family</i>
<i>does not insist that you study...</i>

17:24.251 --> 17:26.128
<i>then you get married.</i>

17:29.882 --> 17:32.051
<i>You can't pursue anything else.</i>

17:33.135 --> 17:34.720
<i>It's like a chain.</i>

17:36.388 --> 17:39.141
There needs to be someone
to break that cycle.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.400
<i>When Karla was barely 13...</i>

17:50.110 --> 17:51.779
her dad told me that,

17:51.862 --> 17:55.074
<i>"I hope to make a good wife</i>
<i>out of my daughter."</i>

17:58.077 --> 18:01.163
<i>I took those words to heart</i>
<i>and said, "Wow."</i>

18:05.459 --> 18:07.628
<i>I was about to lose my daughter.</i>

18:10.923 --> 18:12.341
<i>I said to Karlita,</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:15.260
<i>"I don't want you</i>
<i>to repeat this same story."</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:19.598
She said to me,
"Well, I want to go to boarding school."

18:26.355 --> 18:30.192
Then I said, "Now what am I going to do?"

18:37.366 --> 18:39.660
<i>I was very worried about the money.</i>

18:44.665 --> 18:46.250
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

19:22.619 --> 19:27.708
<i>I knew I had to work hard</i>
<i>to make more money for Karla's school.</i>

19:29.543 --> 19:32.337
<i>My husband kept all the money.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:41.221
<i>So, the responsibility was mine.</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:48.478
<i>I had a very difficult decision to make.</i>

19:51.273 --> 19:56.236
<i>I talked to Karla and told her</i>
<i>that I have to go to the United States.</i>

19:57.237 --> 20:00.616
"But you'll be fine.
You're going to have money for school.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.076
I'm going to work for you. Just for you."

20:07.956 --> 20:09.541
<i>"Yes, Mommy, go.</i>

20:11.501 --> 20:12.836
I'll be fine."

20:17.049 --> 20:21.178
<i>I talk with the man</i>
<i>who is going to bring us in, the coyote.</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:28.310
<i>He asks me to wait a few months</i>
<i>and that I get ready to go in May.</i>

20:30.646 --> 20:32.189
<i>I prepare myself.</i>

20:33.398 --> 20:35.317
<i>I run every day.</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:38.654
And Karla tells me, "Eat well

20:38.737 --> 20:41.406
so that you are strong
when you cross the desert."

20:45.702 --> 20:47.996
<i>We flew to Ciudad Ju√°rez.</i>

20:50.707 --> 20:52.793
<i>Arrived at dawn.</i>

20:54.753 --> 20:56.922
<i>It was a group of 24.</i>

20:58.173 --> 21:01.551
<i>We are all together, we are united.</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:09.476
<i>We wear a cap and dark clothes</i>
<i>to be hidden in the desert.</i>

21:15.274 --> 21:18.735
Then they tell us
that we are going to start walking.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.625
I lift my eyes. See the sky.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.297
<i>And it was so bright.</i>

21:40.257 --> 21:45.137
You can hear the singing of the crickets
and nothing more.

21:52.185 --> 21:56.481
<i>We walked in the desert for 15 days.</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:05.198
<i>We ran out of food.</i>

22:13.123 --> 22:18.545
<i>There were rainstorms</i>
<i>you could not hide from.</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:25.969
<i>Finally, there are two roads.</i>

22:27.387 --> 22:29.181
<i>That is what is called "the line."</i>

22:32.184 --> 22:33.685
<i>You have to run.</i>

22:34.311 --> 22:39.357
And it has to be very fast because
immigration is checking with their radar.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.823
<i>I took a deep breath...</i>

22:48.825 --> 22:51.328
Then, I ran like I was being chased.

22:56.541 --> 23:00.462
You feel like you're flying,
like you have to make it.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.383
<i>You have to run and forget everything.</i>

23:06.843 --> 23:08.553
<i>You feel like you can't.</i>

23:10.263 --> 23:11.765
Run, run, run.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.150
Yes, give me that paper.

24:03.650 --> 24:04.860
Thank you.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.613
-Here are the eggs.
-Thank you.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.700
When I crossed the desert,

24:11.783 --> 24:15.036
I realized that there was
a different woman in me.

24:20.083 --> 24:25.839
<i>I walked the streets for a month,</i>
<i>looking for work.</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:31.428
Knocking on the doors
of restaurants, pizzerias...

24:32.137 --> 24:35.849
<i>"Give me a job. I want to wash dishes.</i>
<i>I want to do something."</i>

24:37.642 --> 24:39.728
<i>Finally, I met a chef.</i>

24:40.812 --> 24:44.983
He says, "Okay. You will do
the preparation and cut vegetables."

24:51.990 --> 24:56.494
<i>I am very focused, very silent,</i>
<i>doing what they are telling me.</i>

24:59.998 --> 25:02.459
<i>But the chef does not speak Spanish.</i>

25:04.669 --> 25:09.549
I don't speak English. That friction
of communication was very difficult.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.724
<i>So, I had to learn by watching.</i>

25:22.562 --> 25:27.609
I had to get everything right
the first time.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.574
<i>I had the strength to do it for Karla.</i>

25:39.246 --> 25:41.873
<i>Four months pass very quickly.</i>

25:43.208 --> 25:45.835
<i>Then, they say, "We want to talk to you."</i>

25:47.754 --> 25:51.383
"We want to offer you the opportunity
to make desserts."

25:56.721 --> 25:58.139
<i>I felt accepted.</i>

26:02.936 --> 26:05.730
But the most important thing was

26:06.690 --> 26:08.733
<i>I could send money to Karla.</i>

26:32.299 --> 26:34.509
-How many?
-Four.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.864
<i>I was working double shifts.</i>

27:00.493 --> 27:03.830
Focused on sending money to Karla.

27:31.107 --> 27:36.780
<i>And when I saw Ben for the first time,</i>
<i>I said, "I'm going to marry this man."</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:41.159
Then my coworker hears and says,
"You're crazy."

27:41.242 --> 27:44.162
And I say, "Yes, I will marry him."

27:48.666 --> 27:51.920
<i>Then we're talking a little bit.</i>

27:53.505 --> 27:57.342
But his Spanish is very little
and my English is nothing.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.055
<i>And I was very nervous.</i>

28:30.583 --> 28:34.587
<i>One day, Benjamin tells me,</i>
<i>"I want you to rest one day.</i>

28:36.297 --> 28:38.216
<i>Let's go to the river."</i>

28:41.469 --> 28:43.596
<i>I hear the birds.</i>

28:46.266 --> 28:49.686
<i>And the rustling of the trees.</i>

28:52.605 --> 28:56.901
<i>He took me by the hands and he kissed me.</i>

28:56.985 --> 29:01.823
And I was like,
"Wow! I have an American boyfriend!"

29:07.203 --> 29:12.167
<i>A week later, I talked to Karla,</i>
<i>and told her I met a man.</i>

29:12.250 --> 29:16.045
"Ay, Mommy!
I've never heard you so excited."

29:19.132 --> 29:22.552
<i>But I heard that my daughter</i>
<i>was very happy.</i>

29:22.635 --> 29:27.223
<i>That gave me the confidence</i>
<i>to go out with Ben.</i>

29:34.481 --> 29:35.857
<i>Time passes.</i>

29:35.940 --> 29:39.819
<i>It was more.</i>
<i>More chemistry, more love, more...</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:44.574
<i>I fell in love with Ben.</i>

29:49.412 --> 29:53.333
When I married Ben, my life changed.

29:58.546 --> 30:03.635
<i>Ben gave me light and confidence.</i>

30:06.304 --> 30:11.059
And I found that stability,
protection and that love

30:11.142 --> 30:14.938
that I searched for
for many years of my life.

31:16.583 --> 31:21.004
May we never lack sustenance
in every family, in every village.

31:21.087 --> 31:24.507
From our great An√°huac,
our great people of the Americas.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.134
Our great people of Mexico.

31:27.635 --> 31:31.139
<i>The energy of the corn is totally unique.</i>

31:31.764 --> 31:35.852
<i>It is more special, more original.</i>

31:42.191 --> 31:46.362
<i>It's something that nourishes</i>
<i>both your heart and your spirit.</i>

31:46.863 --> 31:49.824
<i>It makes us stronger men and women.</i>

31:52.493 --> 31:58.499
And since the taco is made from corn,
it deserves a lot of respect.

32:01.044 --> 32:05.882
Unfortunately, in the United States,
we have genetically modified corn.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.177
There isn't a natural corn.

33:15.868 --> 33:20.748
I'm very proud to be making tortillas
from indigenous corn.

33:24.252 --> 33:27.880
<i>To eat this tortilla is to feel at home.</i>

33:57.869 --> 33:59.579
It looks like you're in a canoe.

34:01.622 --> 34:05.001
Look, it's like this,
"Hey, this is the technique!"

34:05.585 --> 34:10.631
It's kind of getting puffy.
Yes, it's getting puffy.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.967
And how do you say "puffy" in English?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.354
It's very hot.

34:39.786 --> 34:44.916
<i>We go see a lawyer</i>
<i>to process my immigration papers.</i>

34:46.084 --> 34:50.963
The lawyer told me
that I have to ask for my boss's help.

34:52.131 --> 34:56.052
<i>To write me a letter of support.</i>

34:59.555 --> 35:02.475
<i>And the chef tells me</i>
<i>that he can't do anything.</i>

35:02.558 --> 35:04.268
<i>That he's sorry.</i>

35:06.270 --> 35:08.940
And they fired me from the restaurant.

35:14.862 --> 35:19.075
<i>Right then,</i>
<i>I realized that I was not accepted.</i>

36:06.080 --> 36:09.333
<i>The truth is that,</i>
<i>if you're married to an American,</i>

36:09.417 --> 36:13.171
it doesn't grant you the right
to automatically acquire your green card.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.472
<i>Because I crossed the border</i>
<i>through the desert,</i>

36:24.432 --> 36:26.184
<i>I was ineligible.</i>

36:29.478 --> 36:31.522
The doors were closed for me.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.161
<i>I couldn't send my daughter money anymore.</i>

36:50.833 --> 36:55.671
<i>I had lost something huge</i>
<i>that I cherished.</i>

37:03.095 --> 37:06.849
<i>I'm wondering,</i>
<i>"What am I even doing in Philadelphia?"</i>

37:16.359 --> 37:19.612
<i>And then I saw the light again.</i>

37:26.244 --> 37:28.246
<i>In the eyes of men...</i>

37:31.999 --> 37:35.169
<i>we must have a paper to say who we are.</i>

37:42.009 --> 37:45.680
But in the eyes of God, we're all equal.

37:53.437 --> 37:58.567
<i>I was dreaming of Mexico,</i>
<i>dreaming of barbacoa.</i>

38:02.905 --> 38:04.907
<i>It motivated me to keep going.</i>

38:10.121 --> 38:12.123
<i>The road was not finished.</i>

38:25.928 --> 38:29.598
Okay, this is the pancita.
Do you want to try it?

38:59.503 --> 39:01.464
<i>I was excited to start something.</i>

39:06.093 --> 39:11.223
I was clear with my barbacoa,
with my menu.

39:17.229 --> 39:21.150
<i>It was my home, my restaurant.</i>
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

39:30.409 --> 39:34.205
<i>More people started to arrive,</i>
<i>more people came to the apartment.</i>

39:36.290 --> 39:40.252
<i>Needing to eat and feel at home.</i>

39:42.963 --> 39:44.840
<i>They were immigrants like me.</i>

39:47.676 --> 39:51.305
That's when we began to form
our community.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.121
<i>Buenos d√≠as.</i>

40:58.914 --> 41:01.417
Once we opened the doors
to our restaurant,

41:02.877 --> 41:05.379
<i>our popularity grew.</i>

41:08.924 --> 41:11.469
<i>Chefs from all over the city</i>
<i>started coming.</i>

41:13.137 --> 41:15.973
<i>They told me it was very delicious.</i>

41:17.808 --> 41:19.310
<i>They were proud,</i>

41:19.393 --> 41:23.189
<i>because we needed new people</i>
<i>in the neighborhood with new ideas.</i>

41:24.106 --> 41:26.942
We were in an exciting time.

41:29.361 --> 41:33.657
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>I was listening to everyone. </i>

41:34.867 --> 41:39.079
<i>That the working conditions</i>
<i>weren't equal for immigrants.</i>

41:40.289 --> 41:43.834
<i>We shared ideas and talked about change.</i>

41:50.758 --> 41:52.551
<i>In November of 2016,</i>

41:52.635 --> 41:58.098
Bon App√©tit <i>released the ten best</i>
<i>new restaurants in the United States.</i>

42:03.062 --> 42:06.232
<i>When she started to get</i>
<i>that media attention,</i>

42:07.107 --> 42:10.778
<i>the most interesting thing was</i>
<i>the barbacoa was the least of it.</i>

42:11.487 --> 42:16.909
She wanted to say
there was a more important fight.

42:18.869 --> 42:23.874
<i>All of a sudden, I'm on the radio,</i>
<i>on TV, in magazines.</i>

42:25.292 --> 42:31.298
<i>I realized the voice of my community</i>
<i>could be my voice.</i>

42:34.134 --> 42:37.429
<i>Immigrants are hidden. They are exploited.</i>

42:39.431 --> 42:43.018
<i>This is the system</i>
<i>that I want people to see.</i>

42:45.771 --> 42:47.481
It didn't matter what would happen.

42:48.482 --> 42:50.526
<i>I was going to speak the truth.</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:20.097
<i>My community is very important.</i>

43:28.606 --> 43:29.690
<i>It's very important,</i>

43:29.773 --> 43:35.321
<i>because in each of them,</i>
<i>I see my own family.</i>

43:37.615 --> 43:41.535
<i>Every person who has come to my restaurant</i>
<i>has a story.</i>

43:43.912 --> 43:45.789
A story that weighs.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.493
<i>Cristina has risen above.</i>

45:05.828 --> 45:11.834
<i>Standing her ground for all these people,</i>
<i>fueled by love.</i>

45:13.919 --> 45:19.425
She is able to see her family
in each person who enters her restaurant.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.514
<i>She serves her food</i>
<i>prepared with all her love.</i>

45:27.766 --> 45:32.354
<i>All with the hope that one day</i>
<i>her daughter will step through that door</i>

45:32.438 --> 45:34.857
<i>and sit at her table and eat her food.</i>

46:06.805 --> 46:07.848
Hi.

46:08.682 --> 46:11.894
<i>Hello, Karla. How is everyone there?</i>

46:11.977 --> 46:15.564
Fine, fine. Busy but good.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.445
<i>We have tried twice to get my visa.</i>

46:21.987 --> 46:24.072
<i>I had the interview and...</i>

46:24.156 --> 46:25.949
And, well, I was denied.

46:27.367 --> 46:30.287
We had a very, very, very, busy week.

46:30.370 --> 46:35.334
And Ben is helping me a lot.
We are organizing.

46:37.669 --> 46:41.423
Well, for me, lots of work.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.884
I have been studying a lot.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.220
A lot, a lot.

46:47.095 --> 46:49.139
<i>You have to continue.</i>

46:49.223 --> 46:53.560
<i>I am here for you. Always.</i>

46:55.062 --> 46:58.440
<i>I feel really happy</i>
<i>that I'm going to be a nurse.</i>

46:58.524 --> 47:01.485
<i>I have one more year until I graduate.</i>

47:02.528 --> 47:07.658
But my dream is to be with her,
give her a hug and take a picture.

47:11.411 --> 47:14.665
<i>We made mole, we did tinga,</i>

47:14.748 --> 47:18.544
<i>a few rich tinga tostadas.</i>

47:20.087 --> 47:23.006
<i>I have my career, but she's far away.</i>

47:25.259 --> 47:27.177
<i>There are sacrifices you have to make.</i>

47:28.720 --> 47:30.639
I send you many kisses.
