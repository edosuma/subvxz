08:55.368 --> 08:56.970
OH, UM...SORRY.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.072
- WE BELIEVE THAT MONOGAMY

08:59.106 --> 09:02.075
IS THE FOUNDATION
OF A SOLID RELATIONSHIP.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.678
DON'T WE, SWEETHEART?
- ABSOLUTELY.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.313
- OH, THAT'S...

09:06.346 --> 09:08.281
THAT'S SO INSPIRING.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.783
UM...

09:09.817 --> 09:11.619
IT'S GOING TO BE
A REAL PRIVILEGE TO, UH...

09:11.652 --> 09:15.055
TO WORK FOR TWO DISTINGUISHED
GENTLEMEN LIKE YOURSELVES.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.323
SO...
[zipper unzips]

09:16.356 --> 09:17.991
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO START?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.292
both: WAIT!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.161
W-W-WHAT? I'M A...
NAKED MAID.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.230
DIDN'T THEY...
TELL YOU, THE AGENCY?

09:23.263 --> 09:25.966
- YES, BUT, UM,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.200
- WELL--
- YOU SEE,

09:27.234 --> 09:28.836
EVEN THOUGH SOME MEMBERS
OF OUR COMMUNITY

09:28.869 --> 09:31.705
FIND IT TITILLATING TO
SEXUALIZE EVEN DOMESTIC WORK,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.674
WE PREFER YOU
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.076
- WE'LL PAY YOU THE SAME FEE,
OF COURSE.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.245
- IT'S JUST OUR SMALL WAY
OF BRINGING A LITTLE DIGNITY

09:38.278 --> 09:39.246
TO OUR COMMUNITY.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.148
- OUR LAST MAID
GOT A PhD.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.751
- REALLY?
[chuckles]

09:43.784 --> 09:45.686
WELL, IF IT'S NOT
ONE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE,

09:45.719 --> 09:47.320
IT'S ANOTHER.

09:48.922 --> 09:53.293
SO, UH, WHICH WAY
IS THE DESIGNER KITCHEN?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.328
- THIS WAY.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.632
- COULD I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?
THANKS.

- NO. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO HAVE AS...

IS IN CRISIS.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.370
WE HAVE TO TALK.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.072
- HONEY, YOU'LL NEVER
GUESS WHO'S HERE.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.440
- OH, TANNIS!
PHILLIP!

12:20.473 --> 12:22.442
WHAT A SURPRISE,
HAVE A SEAT.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.082
- [clears throat]

12:29.116 --> 12:30.918
SO YOU WERE SAYING
WE HAVE A PROBLEM?

12:30.951 --> 12:33.253
[muffled buzzing]

12:33.286 --> 12:35.789
- HAVE YOU READ
HOWARD BELLWEATHER'S ARTICLE?

12:35.823 --> 12:37.490
- IF OUR CORPORATE SPONSORS

12:37.524 --> 12:39.392
HEAR THAT WE'RE GIVING
BRIAN KINNEY AN AWARD,

12:39.426 --> 12:40.828
THEY WILL CUT US OFF.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.864
WE'LL LOSE OUR SUPPORT,
OUR FUNDING...

12:43.897 --> 12:45.232
DO YOU HEAR A BUZZING?

12:45.265 --> 12:49.202
- OH, NO, I--UH,
THE BABY MONITOR'S ON THE FRITZ.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.004
- SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S COMING FROM...

12:51.038 --> 12:53.340
[buzzing]

12:53.373 --> 12:54.975
- OH! GOD!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.243
- OHH.
- EW!

12:56.276 --> 12:57.978
- THERE IT IS.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.048
- DID YOU KNOW, UM...

13:01.081 --> 13:02.816
VIBRATION IN THE SOIL

13:02.850 --> 13:05.118
PRODUCES IONIZATION,
WHICH IN TURN,

13:05.152 --> 13:07.554
STIMULATES GROWTH,
CAUSING THE PETALS TO OPEN?

13:07.587 --> 13:08.889
IT'S...

13:08.922 --> 13:10.557
- THIS IS
A COMPLETELY UNFAIR

13:10.590 --> 13:11.959
AND DISHONEST ATTACK.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.593
JUSTIN TAYLOR'S
A COLLEGE STUDENT.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.262
- [scoffs]
- THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS LEGAL,

13:15.295 --> 13:17.564
CONSENSUAL,
AND VERY LOVING.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.399
- BESIDES, THE AWARD
IS FOR BRIAN'S COURAGE,

13:19.432 --> 13:20.467
NOT HIS SEXUAL CONDUCT.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.502
- TELL THAT
TO OUR BENEFACTORS.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.972
THE SCENT OF A SCANDAL
COULD SEND THEM PACKING,

13:25.005 --> 13:27.007
ALONG WITH
THEIR CLUTCH PURSES.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.308
- THAT IS WHY YOU TWO

13:28.341 --> 13:30.577
HAVE GOT TO GET KINNEY
TO DECLINE IT.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.213
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH

13:33.246 --> 13:34.347
TO GET HIM TO ACCEPT IT?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.817
- WELL, THEN, IT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM, SHOULD IT?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.822
- OH.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.326
- HE STOOD ME UP.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.560
- [sarcastically]
NO!

13:47.594 --> 13:48.395
- HE PROMISED
HE'D BE THERE.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.330
I BOUGHT UBER-PASSES
AND EVERYTHING.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.232
- WELL, I HATE TO SAY THIS,
MICHAEL,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.201
BUT MAYBE YOU AND HE
ARE...

13:54.234 --> 13:55.235
DRIFTING APART.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.438
- HONEY, IT HAPPENS
TO THE CLOSEST OF FRIENDS.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.373
- SO HOW ABOUT COMING...

14:00.407 --> 14:01.574
[grunts softly]
WITH ME

14:01.608 --> 14:03.576
TO THE BELLWEATHER
BOOK SIGNING?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.412
- AFTER WHAT HE WROTE
ABOUT BRIAN?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.347
- OH,
BRIAN'S HARDLY A HERO.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.249
- GOD, TEDDY, WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SUCH A PRUDE?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.318
- SINCE HE LOST HIS JOB,
WHACKING OFF.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.486
- I'M NOT A PRUDE.
AND I WASN'T WHACK...

14:13.520 --> 14:14.421
I-I JUST...
I JUST...

14:14.454 --> 14:16.589
I HAPPEN TO THINK
HE MIGHT HAVE A POINT.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.892
- WELL, I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
ARE IN A POSITION TO JUDGE,

14:18.926 --> 14:20.560
CONSIDERING SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT WE'VE DONE.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.995
- I HAVE NOTHING TO BE
ASHAMED OF.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.296
- OH, I COULD REMIND YOU
OF A FEW.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.365
- OHH.
GOTTA GO!

14:25.398 --> 14:28.168
- YEP, ME TOO. I'M IRONING
MY BOSS'S PANTS.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.470
- AREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE BARE-ASSED?

14:30.503 --> 14:31.338
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

14:31.371 --> 14:33.440
THEY PREFER ME TO KEEP
MY CLOTHES ON.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.908
- ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE GAY?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.944
- [scoffs]
NOT ONLY ARE THEY GAY,

14:36.977 --> 14:39.012
THEY'RE THE MOST DECENT PEOPLE
I'VE EVER MET.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.382
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE BRIAN,
IF YOU EVER DO,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.117
YOU CAN TELL HIM
HE'S WRONG.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.653
THOSE PEOPLE ON GAY AS BLAZES
DO EXIST.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.989
[spraying]

14:55.428 --> 14:57.664
- HEY.
- OH! HEH, HI.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.499
[chuckles]
AH, BLAINE CALLED.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.102
HE'S, UH, DOING
SOME EXTRA PRO BONO WORK

15:02.135 --> 15:04.404
AT THE GAY HOMELESS SHELTER,

15:04.437 --> 15:08.141
AND YOU'RE DUE AT THE GAY
HARVARD GRADUATES' LUNCHEON.

15:08.175 --> 15:12.245
I'LL HAVE THIS DONE
IN A--IN A JIFF.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.214
- YOU'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB,
EMMETT.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.983
- THANK YOU.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.384
IT'S JUST, WELL...

15:17.417 --> 15:18.551
SEEING YOU TWO HAS...

15:18.585 --> 15:20.553
HAS REALLY INSPIRED ME
TO, UH,

15:20.587 --> 15:24.391
TO STRIVE, TO ACHIEVE,
TO BETTER MYSELF.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.259
- THAT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.029
- WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO,

15:29.062 --> 15:31.131
YOU LET ME KNOW.
- OKAY.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.565
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE!
[chuckling]

15:32.599 --> 15:34.634
- LET ME.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.172
OOPS!
DROPPED YOUR TOWEL.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.208
- YEAH, DARN.
I KNOW.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.544
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GET THAT FOR ME?

15:53.553 --> 15:57.157
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.159
- I--I SEE THAT.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.603
- HOW ARE MY SCRAMBLED EGGS
COMING, HONEY?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.205
- OH, SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

16:12.239 --> 16:15.308
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.583
- KEEP IT UP, SUNSHINE.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.518
THE GOOD WORK, THAT IS.
[chuckling]

16:25.552 --> 16:26.653
ISN'T HE SOMETHING?

16:26.686 --> 16:29.256
MM, MOTHER'S LITTLE HELPER.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.058
- MOTHER'S LITTLE HELPER
IS VALIUM.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.159
- HUH?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.694
- IT'S A DRUG REFERENCE
FROM A ROLLING STONES SONG.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.396
- I KNOW THE SONG,
THANK YOU.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.365
I WAS LISTENING TO IT
BEFORE YOU WERE FUCKIN' BORN.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.501
- ANCIENT HISTORY.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.670
- [chuckling]

16:45.105 --> 16:49.109
OKAY, WHAT'D HE DO
THIS TIME?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.210
- WHO?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.412
- "WHO?"
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.486
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET ME
AT THE COMIC CONVENTION, AND--

16:59.519 --> 17:02.389
- I'M BITING MY TONGUE SO HARD,
I'M TASTING BLOOD.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.158
- SO JUST SAY IT.
YOU WILL ANYWAY.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.834
- WHY MUST YOUR HAPPINESS
ALWAYS DEPEND ON SOMEONE ELSE?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.770
FIRST BRIAN, THEN DAVID.
NOW BACK TO BRIAN.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.607
- YOU FINISHED?
- I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.342
IF YOU CAME BACK HERE
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT

17:22.375 --> 17:24.377
BRIAN WAS MISSING YOU AS BAD
AS YOU WERE MISSING HIM,

17:24.411 --> 17:25.845
YOU FUCKED UP BIG-TIME.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.680
- THAT'S NOT
WHY I CAME BACK.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.516
- HE HAS A LIFE
OF HIS OWN.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.186
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
ABOUT YOU.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.155
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE ME SAYING THIS...

17:35.188 --> 17:38.325
- I'M SURE OF THAT.

17:38.358 --> 17:42.829
- I THINK HE ACTUALLY MIGHT
LOVE THIS KID.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.564
AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.767
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.236
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.772
AT LEAST I THOUGHT WE WERE.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.575
THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO CHANGE.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.452
- WELL, ONE MINUTE,
I'M STARCHING HIS COLLAR.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.188
THE NEXT MINUTE,
I'M SUCKING HIS COCK.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.158
SINGLE-HANDEDLY, I'VE DESTROYED
11 YEARS OF FIDELITY.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.525
THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.893
I'M SCUM.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.462
NO, I'M WORSE THAN SCUM.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.597
UH...
WHAT'S WORSE THAN SCUM?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.399
- WE'VE ALL BEEN AROUND
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

18:19.432 --> 18:21.334
THAT NOBODY DOES ANYTHING
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.735
THIS BLAIR SOUNDS LIKE
NO ANGEL.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.773
- PFFT, WELL, HE WAS.
NOW HE'S FALLEN.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.876
OH, I'M--I'M THE SNAKE
IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.744
THAT'S WHAT I AM.
- STOP BLAMING YOURSELF!

18:31.778 --> 18:33.880
- NO,
START BLAMING YOURSELF.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.215
YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED

18:35.248 --> 18:36.416
IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR MIND
OFF OF SEX

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
LONG ENOUGH TO THINK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.287
- LIKE WHAT?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.255
- LIKE GOING TO A MUSEUM.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.624
OR READING A BOOK.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.725
- A BOOK?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.728
- YEAH, IT'S GOT PAGES,
LITTLE...

18:48.761 --> 18:50.630
WORDS ON IT,
YOU KNOW, COVER.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.233
ALLEGEDLY IT IMPROVES THE MIND
AND...OH!

18:53.266 --> 18:54.934
HEY, YEAH, THEY HAPPEN
TO SELL THEM RIGHT HERE.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.102
ANYBODY CARE TO JOIN ME?

18:56.135 --> 19:01.608
- NO. YOU KEEP YOUR HERO.
I'LL STICK TO CAPTAIN ASTRO.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.576
- OH, MY GOD,
I'VE GOT TO GO

19:03.610 --> 19:06.746
MAKE DINNER
FOR BLAINE AND BLAIR.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.481
HOW AM I GOING TO FACE THEM?
WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY?

19:08.515 --> 19:12.452
- DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.254
AND FOR GOD'S SAKE,
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.256
- [sighs]

19:23.496 --> 19:26.199
- OW.
- SORRY.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.800
- IT'S OKAY.
WANT TO GO BACK?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.436
- NO.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.470
- SURE?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.705
- YEAH.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.375
LOOK, NO HANDS.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.977
HEY!
FUCKER.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.412
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.949
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST AN ACCIDENT.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.418
DON'T LET IT THROW YOU.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.598
- THANK YOU.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.437
- MR. BELLWEATHER,
I AM SO, SO VALIDATED

20:04.471 --> 20:05.605
BY WHAT YOU WRITE.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.709
YOU ARE A FONT
OF INSPIRATION AND WISDOM.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.710
[sighs]

20:10.743 --> 20:14.281
- A FONT?
WELL, HOW KIND.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.348
AND YOU ARE?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.250

"TO BRIAN KINNEY,

20:28.861 --> 20:31.764
"PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES
FOR WHAT I WROTE ABOUT YOU.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.966

- SUCH A BRIGHT,
BRAVE YOUNG MAN.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.845
IF ANYONE DESERVES AN AWARD
FOR HEROISM, IT'S YOU.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.580
- YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO SAY THOSE THINGS.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.716
- ON THE CONTRARY,
IT WAS MY OBLIGATION.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.584
- HE SAVED MY LIFE.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.621
- HE'S ALSO STOLEN
PART OF IT.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.022
YOUR INNOCENCE,

20:56.055 --> 20:58.591
YOUR YOUTH.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.628
ONE DAY YOU'LL SEE HE'S HURT
YOU AS MUCH AS YOUR ATTACKER.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.564
[all gasp]

21:04.597 --> 21:06.533
- COME ON, BRIAN.
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

21:06.566 --> 21:08.735
- [sighs]

21:10.570 --> 21:12.038
- BY THE WAY...

21:12.071 --> 21:14.441
I'M 30.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.676
- [grunts]

21:18.010 --> 21:20.046
[indistinct chatter]

21:20.079 --> 21:22.515
- [uneasy chuckle]
I...

21:22.549 --> 21:25.652
THANK YOU.
THAT'S GREAT.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.020
- EMMETT?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.656
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.891
- TELL YOU WHAT?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.994
[chopping rapidly]

21:35.027 --> 21:37.096
- THAT YOU COULD COOK.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.031
IT SMELLS FANTASTIC.

21:39.065 --> 21:43.069
- OH, IT'S...
JUST A LITTLE SAUCE PIQUANTE.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.003
FOR THE FISH.

21:44.036 --> 21:48.808
- HMM. BLAIR WILL BE SORRY
HE MISSED THIS.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.811
- HE'S, UH...
HE'S--HE'S NOT HERE?

21:51.844 --> 21:53.546
- IT'S HIS NIGHT TO READ

21:53.580 --> 21:57.550
TO THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
GAY SENIORS GROUP.

21:57.584 --> 22:02.689
- WELL, I'LL JUST, UH, I'LL JUST
SET THE TABLE FOR ONE, THEN.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.458
- WHY DON'T YOU
EAT WITH ME?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.694
I HATE DINING ALONE.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.600
- ALL RIGHT.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.535
- MIND IF I HAVE A TASTE?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.937
- UH, HERE.
LET ME.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.743
- MMM.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.578
- OH! OH!

22:25.612 --> 22:27.480
GOT SOME ON YOUR PANTS.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.583
BETTER--BETTER GET THAT OUT
BEFORE IT...STAINS.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.084
- I'LL TAKE MY PANTS OFF.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.586
- NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.755
DON'T DO THAT.
YEAH, W-WE'LL JUST...

22:35.788 --> 22:38.024
WE'LL JUST DO IT
THIS WAY.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.692
YOU KNOW, ON SECOND THOUGHT,

22:39.726 --> 22:40.993
MAYBE YOU...
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.930
GO AHEAD.
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.434
BUT...
YOU'D BETTER RUB HARDER.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.404
- YEAH, UH...

22:51.438 --> 22:52.905
BEEN TO ANY MUSEUMS?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.974
[panting]

22:55.007 --> 22:58.010
READ ANY GOOD BOOKS...
LATELY?

23:02.915 --> 23:04.083
[whimpers]

23:04.116 --> 23:07.153
LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE.

23:09.021 --> 23:12.158
FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.662
- [moaning]

23:17.897 --> 23:20.032
- CHATEAU FOUTRE, '90.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.635
IT'S A VERY GOOD YEAR.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.837
- BLACK ANGUS.

23:24.871 --> 23:28.140
SO BLUE, IT MOOS.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.509
[timer chimes]

23:29.542 --> 23:31.978
- WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT'S FOR DESSERT.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.682
DEATH BY CHOCOLATE.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.916
- IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY
TO GO?

23:36.949 --> 23:40.119
- AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT
IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER...

23:42.955 --> 23:44.824
- OH, YEAH.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.561
- [sighs]

23:51.831 --> 23:54.467
- [clears throat]
- HMM.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.705
MAYBE THERE IS MORE TO LIFE
THAN SEX.

23:58.738 --> 23:59.706
- [chuckles]

23:59.739 --> 24:00.940
- FINE FOOD,

24:00.973 --> 24:03.810
FINE WINE,

24:03.843 --> 24:04.877
FINE CIGAR.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.245
[both giggle]

24:06.278 --> 24:07.947
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:07.980 --> 24:10.817
- YOU'RE SO CYNICAL, YOU CAN'T
APPRECIATE A LITTLE T.L.C.?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.552
[all chuckle]

24:12.585 --> 24:14.854
- FROM LESBIAN
LUCY AND ETHEL?

24:19.025 --> 24:22.461
SPILL IT.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.997
- YOU KNOW THE AWARD
FROM THE CENTER?

24:25.031 --> 24:27.700
- THE ONE YOU NEVER WANTED
ANYWAY?

24:27.734 --> 24:28.768
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.937
- WELL, GUESS WHAT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.639
[chuckles]
- I DON'T?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.107
- WE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT YOU
DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

24:35.141 --> 24:37.677
WITH PUBLIC ATTENTION,
SO THEY SAID ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

24:37.710 --> 24:39.612
IS SAY, "THANKS ANYWAY,
BUT NO, THANKS,"

24:39.646 --> 24:41.514
AND THE WHOLE THING
WILL JUST GO AWAY.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.915
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

24:42.949 --> 24:44.050
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PREPARE A SPEECH.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.117
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
A TUX.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.821
NOTHING.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.190
- THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.492
- WHAT'S THE REAL REASON?

24:56.596 --> 24:58.798
COULD IT BE THEY READ
HOWARD BELLWEATHER'S BULLSHIT,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.933
AND NOW THEY'RE AFRAID
THAT IF THEY HONOR ME,

25:00.967 --> 25:04.236
THEY'LL TARNISH
THEIR SPOTLESS IMAGE?

25:04.270 --> 25:05.638
OR EVEN WORSE,

25:05.672 --> 25:09.542
LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS
CORPORATE SPONSORS?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.744
AND NOW THEY WANT ME TO
SPARE THEM THE EMBARRASSMENT.

25:11.778 --> 25:12.945
- [sighs]

25:12.979 --> 25:14.747
- GUESS WHAT.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.616
I'M NOT DOING THEM
ANY FAVORS.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.917
- OH, COME ON, BRIAN.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT IT.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.687
- WE PRACTICALLY HAD
TO FORCE-FEED IT TO YOU.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.089
- THAT WAS
BEFORE I REALIZED...

25:23.122 --> 25:24.223
WHAT AN HONOR
IT WOULD BE

25:24.256 --> 25:28.961
TO BE RECOGNIZED BY SUCH A FINE,
UPSTANDING ORGANIZATION.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.296
I'VE EVEN...

25:30.329 --> 25:34.634
STARTED WORKING ON
MY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, IN FACT.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.169
WANT TO HEAR IT?
- GOD!

25:37.203 --> 25:40.039
- [clears throat loudly]

25:40.072 --> 25:43.209
GREETINGS,
AND WELCOME, ALL YOU...

25:43.242 --> 25:45.878
SEXUALLY CHALLENGED,

25:45.912 --> 25:49.982
TRANSMOGRIFIED, BIPOLAR
WHATEVER-THE-FUCK-YOU-ARES...

25:50.016 --> 25:53.620
[upbeat music]

25:53.653 --> 25:56.723
- HEY, BOYS!

25:57.824 --> 25:59.626
HI, HONEY.

25:59.659 --> 26:02.028
HI, TEDDY.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.630
- EXCUSE ME,

26:03.663 --> 26:06.065
BUT I BELIEVE THESE SEATS
ARE RESERVED FOR THE LIVING.

26:06.098 --> 26:09.669
- MA, DO YOU HAVE
TO SIT HERE?

26:09.702 --> 26:11.938
- WELL, I DON'T SEE A SIGN
THAT SAYS, "RESERVED FOR BRIAN."

26:11.971 --> 26:14.774
- I TOLD YOU.
- I KNOW.

26:14.807 --> 26:15.942
I KNOW YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE

26:15.975 --> 26:18.377
HANGING OUT IN GAY BARS
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.846
BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.748
IF YOU MEET SOMEBODY NICE,

26:21.781 --> 26:23.616
YOU WON'T HAVE TO BRING HIM
HOME TO MEET ME

26:23.650 --> 26:25.117
'CAUSE I'M ALREADY HERE.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.853
[laughter]

26:26.886 --> 26:28.955
- I'M NOT MEETING ANYBODY.
- OH.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.725
- WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT,
YOU SURE AS HELL WON'T.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.094
YOU TWO STICK-IN-THE-MUDS
HAVE GOT TO GO HAVE SOME FUN!

26:35.127 --> 26:37.797
COME ON.
GO DANCING, HUH?

26:37.830 --> 26:39.265
GO GET LAID.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.400
- WHAT KIND
OF MINDLESS PALLIATIVE IS THAT

26:41.433 --> 26:42.902
FOR EXISTENTIAL ANGST?

26:42.935 --> 26:45.972
- SAY WHAT?
- A DAMN GOOD ONE.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.840
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE YOU TURN AROUND,

26:47.874 --> 26:49.141
YOU GUYS WILL BE OUR AGE.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.810
- GOD, DON'T REMIND ME.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.679
- AND YOU'LL REGRET
EVERY NIGHT YOU DIDN'T GO OUT

26:52.712 --> 26:54.146
AND GRAB A LITTLE LIFE.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.115
- NOT TO MENTION
A LITTLE ASS.

26:56.148 --> 27:00.787
[both laugh]

27:00.820 --> 27:03.189
- [clears throat]
WELL...

27:03.222 --> 27:05.725
I DID SEE AN INVITATION
ON HOTPITTS.COM

27:05.758 --> 27:07.393
TO A B.B. PARTY.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.061
- I THOUGHT YOU SWORE OFF
THE INTERNET.

27:09.095 --> 27:10.897
- IT WAS A SITE
I FORGOT TO DELETE.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.199
- A B.B. PARTY?

27:13.232 --> 27:14.701
- IT STANDS
FOR BODY BUILDERS.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.302
- MM.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.205
GOD, I JUST LOVE ROCK-HARD PECS
AND RIPPLED ABS.

27:19.238 --> 27:23.175
- GOD, MOM,
YOU ARE SUCH A FAG.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.178
- YEAH, IT PUTS
THE REST OF US TO SHAME.

27:26.212 --> 27:29.181
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

27:38.925 --> 27:40.159
[men moaning]

27:40.192 --> 27:43.162
[My One plays]

27:43.195 --> 27:44.897
*

27:44.931 --> 27:46.799
[indistinct chatter]

27:46.833 --> 27:50.336
- OH, YEAH. I'LL GET A DRINK
FIRST, THANKS.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.905
[loud grunting]

WHOA! HEH.

- SOME PARTY, HUH?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.418
- THIS ISN'T A PARTY.
THIS IS AN ORGY.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.154
- * I GET FROM YOU

28:08.187 --> 28:09.889
- YEAH.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.323
[chuckles]
HI.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.324
- * TAKE THE LEAD
- SORRY.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.894
- COME ON.
- UH...

28:14.927 --> 28:17.163
BOY, IF BRIAN ONLY KNEW
WHAT HE WAS MISSING.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.867
- FUCK BRIAN.

28:20.900 --> 28:25.872
- * YOU ALWAYS KNOW

28:25.905 --> 28:31.077
* JUST WHAT TO DO

28:31.110 --> 28:32.511
- OH, MY GOD!
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

28:32.544 --> 28:34.747
- DON'T POINT.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.182
- THAT'S HOWARD BELLWEATHER.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.117
- * GETS ME THROUGH

28:38.150 --> 28:39.952
- HE DOESN'T HAVE
A VERY GOOD BODY.

28:39.986 --> 28:43.089
- COURSE NOT,
HE'S A WRITER.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.391
- * OH, MY, MY, MY

28:45.424 --> 28:48.360
- THESE GUYS DON'T LOOK
MUCH LIKE BODY BUILDERS TO ME.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.930
- THEY CERTAINLY
ARE GETTING A WORKOUT.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.933
- THAT'S NOT ALL
THAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.802
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.804
- HORS D'OEUVRES?

28:59.471 --> 29:01.974
- CONDOMS.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.911
NO ONE'S USING CONDOMS.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.913
- OHH.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.981

29:47.419 --> 29:49.989
- OUR MISTAKE WAS SENDING

29:50.022 --> 29:51.490

IN THE FIRST PLACE.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.458
- FEMS.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.226
- IF KINNEY INSISTS
ON ACCEPTING THE AWARD,

29:54.260 --> 29:56.863
WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE
BUT TO REFUSE TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.030
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.866
- EXCUSE ME?
- HONEY, I...

29:59.899 --> 30:01.133
- IF YOU TAKE IT
AWAY NOW,

30:01.167 --> 30:03.169
YOU'LL BE IN BREACH
OF PROMISE,

30:03.202 --> 30:04.203
AND HE'LL TAKE ACTION.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.404
- WHAT KIND OF ACTION?

30:05.437 --> 30:06.438
- LEGAL ACTION.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.374
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING
HE'D SUE?

30:08.407 --> 30:11.310
- "NONPROFIT" WILL TAKE ON
A WHOLE NEW MEANING

30:11.343 --> 30:12.945
WHEN HE'S
THROUGH WITH YOU.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.214
- IS THIS TRUE?

30:15.247 --> 30:17.416
- IF HE WANTED TO,
HE COULD DRAG US TO COURT.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.451
- BUT THAT WOULD BE
FINANCIALLY RUINOUS,

THE HUMILIATION.

MY PROFESSIONAL ADVICE...

30:26.225 --> 30:30.262
IS TO JUST GIVE HIM
THE FUCKING AWARD.

CONGRATULATE MR. KINNEY

TO HIS LONG LIST

30:36.468 --> 30:38.837

30:43.475 --> 30:46.345
- BREACH OF PROMISE?
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.614

EVERYBODY'S BEHAVIOR?

31:13.339 --> 31:14.941
- ESPECIALLY BRIAN'S.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.576
- TO THINK I JUST SPENT
25 BUCKS ON HIS NEW BOOK.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.645
- MAYBE HE'LL USE THE MONEY
TO BUY RUBBERS.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.347
- IS THERE NO SUCH THING
AS DECENCY LEFT?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.449
- THERE WAS.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.551
ONCE UPON A TIME...

31:25.584 --> 31:27.186
UNTIL I CAME ALONG.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.457
- I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF!

31:31.490 --> 31:32.491

31:32.524 --> 31:34.226
YOU SAID THEY WERE
A HAPPILY COMMITTED COUPLE.
