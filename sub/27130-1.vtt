Paddle faster. Go!

03:10.580 --> 03:12.049
How are you?

03:13.516 --> 03:14.949
Just keep talking to 'em.
Go.

03:14.951 --> 03:17.619
See? I knew they'd
be here to see us.

03:17.621 --> 03:19.821
Anyway, the weather is nice,
isn't it?

03:19.823 --> 03:22.026
- Want to go swimming later?
- [chatters]

03:23.026 --> 03:26.394
- Aren't they awesome?
- Yeah.

03:26.396 --> 03:28.799
Hey, hold still, little buddy. Let's
get you on camera. Come here.

03:29.766 --> 03:30.935
Come here.

03:31.968 --> 03:33.602
That's your favorite one,

Let's go!

03:44.615 --> 03:46.815

[Kevin] All right.
Time to switch cameras.

05:11.601 --> 05:13.935
That footage,
though, was amazing.

05:13.937 --> 05:16.070
Are you gonna
be famous, Kev?

05:16.072 --> 05:19.443
Nah. I just wanna make
real movies, you know?

05:20.776 --> 05:22.776
Need a new camera,

05:22.778 --> 05:25.113
full editing suite,
sound equipment.

05:25.115 --> 05:26.815
Don't give up, okay?

05:26.817 --> 05:30.618
Christmas is
only 158 days away.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.120
Yeah, only you
would know that.

05:32.122 --> 05:34.459
You gotta keep up
with the important stuff.

05:35.225 --> 05:36.824
You're such a nerd.

05:36.826 --> 05:38.860
And you are just jealous.

05:38.862 --> 05:40.094
Yeah, sure.

Not.

[Kevin] Oh, hey, big guy.
How's the fishing today?

05:45.869 --> 05:47.601
[honks]
[Holly] Not good, I guess.

05:47.603 --> 05:49.837
He's got that "I'm hungry"
look. [Seasalt clucks]

05:49.839 --> 05:51.706
And I'm starving, too.

05:51.708 --> 05:52.873
Ditto.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.976
I'll get the fishing poles.
I'll get the stove ready.

05:54.978 --> 05:56.079
You fish, and I'll cook.

06:05.154 --> 06:06.156
Kevin!

06:07.057 --> 06:07.988
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

06:07.990 --> 06:08.860
Look.

06:10.293 --> 06:12.026
[Holly] Probably a loggerhead.
Mm-hmm.

06:12.028 --> 06:15.163
I just hope they hatch while we're here.
I wanna film 'em.

06:15.165 --> 06:18.669
Well, it takes them
about 60 days to hatch.

06:19.302 --> 06:20.935
You read way too much.

06:20.937 --> 06:24.072
Just depends
on the temperature,

06:24.074 --> 06:25.339
rain, "humididee."

06:25.341 --> 06:27.043
It's "humidity."

06:27.911 --> 06:30.178
That's what I said,
"humimidee."

06:30.180 --> 06:31.115
[chuckles]

06:32.182 --> 06:34.048
Hey, be careful.
You can't touch 'em.

06:34.050 --> 06:36.187
Duh. I know that.

06:37.653 --> 06:40.524
Loads of creatures around
like the taste of turtle eggs.

Yes, sir.

- [camera beeping]
- [man] Yeah, working on it.

07:47.189 --> 07:48.690
He's old friends
with the owner.

07:48.692 --> 07:50.358
We are gonna
be in business.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.827
[man 2] So break it to me.
Where do we stand?

07:52.829 --> 07:54.361
[man 1] The last 10 acres.

07:54.363 --> 07:56.664
[man 2] How many acres you say?
Mom called. We gotta go.

07:56.666 --> 07:57.432
[softly]
Get down. Look.

07:57.434 --> 07:58.933
[man 1] It's 100, I believe.

07:58.935 --> 08:00.168
[man 3] 102.
[man 1] Ah.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.070
I like exact.

08:02.072 --> 08:03.003
You stay here.

08:03.005 --> 08:04.007
Sure thing.

08:07.877 --> 08:09.877
Okay, are you 100 percent
sure this thing's covered?

08:09.879 --> 08:11.980
This thing goes south...
I'm finished.

08:11.982 --> 08:14.048
You have my word on it.
Election's coming up.

08:14.050 --> 08:16.050
I can't afford any screw-ups.
[sighs]

08:16.052 --> 08:18.420
Get us that zoning permit, and
I'll take care of the rest.

08:18.422 --> 08:20.988
This deal just might
help you win reelection.

08:20.990 --> 08:23.193
You just remember this,
Mills.

08:24.161 --> 08:26.030
I go down,
you go down, too.

08:27.064 --> 08:28.296
Gotta run.

Never keep hungry money waiting.
Don't laugh.

08:32.469 --> 08:35.706
You have two weeks to close the deal
with those investors, or they walk.

08:36.405 --> 08:37.974
It's done.
Don't worry about it.

08:40.043 --> 08:41.241
[sighs]

08:41.244 --> 08:43.177
Get, um...
Get those blueprints

08:43.179 --> 08:46.314
that fit all that EPA crap
on my desk ASAP.

08:46.316 --> 08:49.084
Sure thing. I'll have 'em drawn
up, by, say, Monday morning?

08:49.086 --> 08:50.421
Excellent, and, um...

08:51.455 --> 08:53.924
Let's keep this
quiet, okay?

08:56.393 --> 08:57.725
As a church mouse.

08:57.727 --> 08:59.026
What do you think
they're doing here?

08:59.028 --> 09:00.230
This is our cove.

09:02.131 --> 09:04.431
Don't know, but the man in the
suit sure looked familiar.

09:04.433 --> 09:05.702
[twig cracks]

09:07.269 --> 09:08.773
Mr. Mills.
Hmm?

09:09.940 --> 09:11.842
Uh, we got trouble.

09:14.878 --> 09:16.844
Hey, uh, you kids,
you want to come over here

09:16.846 --> 09:18.249
and take a look
through the telescope?

09:20.850 --> 09:23.320
I don't trust these guys. Let's book it.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

09:24.955 --> 09:27.124
[cell phone dialing]

09:30.527 --> 09:32.296
Hey, Jimmy.
Yeah, it's me.

09:33.395 --> 09:34.931
We might have
a little problem.

09:40.937 --> 09:41.969
Go, go, go.

09:41.971 --> 09:43.406
[squawking]

09:52.414 --> 09:54.148
That was a close one.

09:54.150 --> 09:56.386
Yeah. Wish I could have
filmed those guys.

09:57.153 --> 09:58.154
Something wasn't right.

09:59.822 --> 10:01.024
Over here, guys!

10:04.927 --> 10:07.829
[sighs] I don't see
the dolphins.

10:07.831 --> 10:08.999
Must not
like it either.

10:12.101 --> 10:13.937
Yeah, let's just
head back home.

10:22.178 --> 10:25.012
Hey! Hey, man!
Hey, no-wake zone!

10:25.014 --> 10:25.979
What're you doing?

10:25.981 --> 10:28.148
Hey! Watch where you're going!

10:28.150 --> 10:29.416
Make him stop, Kevin!
Make him stop!

10:29.418 --> 10:30.984
Holly, it's gonna be okay.
Just relax.

10:30.986 --> 10:31.889
Hey!

10:45.936 --> 10:47.271
Holly.

10:48.238 --> 10:49.273

11:28.611 --> 11:29.978
Holly, you okay?

11:29.980 --> 11:31.246
You okay? Come on.

11:31.248 --> 11:32.579
Come on. On the shore.

- [chatters]
- Go ahead.

11:36.152 --> 11:40.054
Come on. Right here.
Just breathe, okay?

11:40.056 --> 11:41.089
Keep breathing.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.090

[Kevin] What a loser.

11:43.092 --> 11:45.895
I'm gonna call the Beach Harbor Patrol!
You're toast, bro!

11:47.898 --> 11:49.430
[Holly] Thanks, Kev.

11:49.432 --> 11:51.232
I knew you'd save me.

11:51.234 --> 11:54.068
It's wasn't me.
It was them.

11:54.070 --> 11:55.570
They saved us.

11:55.572 --> 11:57.906
I'm gonna grab the kayak.
Wait here.

[man] Please tell me at least that
you were wearing your life jacket.

12:47.557 --> 12:48.993
No, sir.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.460
Kev, what if
you two had drowned?

12:53.462 --> 12:56.397
All right, we trust you to be
responsible and look after your sister.

12:56.399 --> 12:58.266
But... But the dolphins
saved us.

12:58.268 --> 13:00.501
Exactly, and it was all that crazy
guy in the speedboat's fault.

13:00.503 --> 13:02.436
Uh-uh. That's not
gonna cut it.

13:02.438 --> 13:04.738
I told you a thousand times,
you go on that water,

13:04.740 --> 13:07.010
you assume that
everyone's a nut-job.

13:07.977 --> 13:09.044
Could have lost my camera, too.

13:09.046 --> 13:11.612
You could have lost your life,
and your sister's.

13:11.614 --> 13:15.416
Now, you know the rules. Safety first.
Two weeks, no kayak.

13:15.418 --> 13:17.620
It wasn't our fault!
You want to make it three?

13:21.091 --> 13:22.357
Sorry, kiddos.
That's life.

13:22.359 --> 13:24.261
There are consequences
for breaking rules.

13:25.327 --> 13:26.694
Speaking of rules, sweetie,

13:26.696 --> 13:29.397
what did we say about the
hat at the kitchen table?

13:29.399 --> 13:31.565
Mm, you sure?

13:31.567 --> 13:33.370
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
Come on.

All right, that's it.

13:45.181 --> 13:47.348
All right, frogs outside.
Kids to bed.

13:47.350 --> 13:49.717
- We're gonna take this up in the morning.
- Sorry, Dad.

13:49.719 --> 13:52.119
- [frog croaks]
- Love you.

13:52.121 --> 13:53.286
Love you.

13:53.288 --> 13:55.189
[Holly] Love you.
[Kevin] Good night.

13:55.191 --> 13:56.791
I mean, what are we gonna
do with these two?

13:56.793 --> 13:58.059
[laughs]

13:58.061 --> 13:59.493
I never acted like that.

13:59.495 --> 14:01.628
Look, they're growing up.
It's just part of it.

14:01.630 --> 14:05.632
No, back in... back in my day and
age, we respected the rules.

14:05.634 --> 14:07.634
I mean, we knew the rules.
We practiced them,

14:07.636 --> 14:09.403
because practice makes...
Don't flinch!

14:09.405 --> 14:11.138
Ow! That's my bum shoulder.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.709
[groans] Obviously
your genes are dominant.

14:14.711 --> 14:17.078
What? Which is why
they're so good-looking.

What's wrong? I've got
a really bad feeling.

14:59.822 --> 15:02.456
Yeah. It's probably Dad's
breakfast burritos, huh?

15:02.458 --> 15:04.459
[laughs]
No.

15:04.461 --> 15:06.196
It's not a stomach-ache
bad feeling.

15:08.730 --> 15:12.336
They're in trouble.
I just know it.

15:14.604 --> 15:16.337
There's my queen.

15:16.339 --> 15:17.637
[chuckles]

15:17.639 --> 15:18.708
How's it going?

15:20.076 --> 15:23.210
I was just thinking that maybe
I should skip summer semester.

15:23.212 --> 15:25.680
Um, I was talking
about the Ryan Express.

15:25.682 --> 15:27.748
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah. Um...

15:27.750 --> 15:29.150
Just the water pump.

15:29.152 --> 15:30.785
Oh, just the water pump.
No big...

15:30.787 --> 15:32.389
Anything else
on your mind?

15:33.222 --> 15:35.455
Well, I don't know.

15:35.457 --> 15:37.425
I mean, maybe I should spend
summer with the kids,

15:37.427 --> 15:39.826
you know,
keep an eye on them.

15:39.828 --> 15:43.699
Honey, what happened
yesterday is not your fault.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.700
Okay? And you
spent so much time.

15:46.702 --> 15:49.302
We gotta get
this master's degree done.

15:49.304 --> 15:51.873
What would
Coach Dunn say, huh?

15:51.875 --> 15:54.175
You march all the way
down the field,

15:54.177 --> 15:55.276
if you don't score...

15:55.278 --> 15:56.877
I know. You'll never finish.
I know.

15:56.879 --> 16:00.448
That's right. And if you wanna
compete, you gotta complete.

16:00.450 --> 16:03.316
Look, well,
one semester won't hurt.

16:03.318 --> 16:06.286
All right, I can be with the
kids, maybe get a part-time job.

16:06.288 --> 16:07.454
Look, money's
been tight lately,

16:07.456 --> 16:10.193
and we got a lot of stuff
to take care of around here.

16:13.196 --> 16:14.264
Come here.

16:15.465 --> 16:16.531
I got this.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.166
Everything is
gonna be fine.

16:18.168 --> 16:20.600
In fact, I have a meeting
this morning with the boss,

16:20.602 --> 16:24.338
and I happen to know that he wants
to talk to me about the VP slot.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.272
Ooh.

16:25.274 --> 16:27.510
And you have a smudge
on your forehead.

16:29.445 --> 16:32.749
[laughs]
Perfect.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.352
The Captain would be
so proud of you.

16:37.419 --> 16:39.856
You think so?
Oh, I know so.

16:41.423 --> 16:43.259
I'll see you tonight.
Right.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.294
- Bye, kids!
- Bye.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.464
Listen to your mother.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.399
Looks like
we're stuck, Kev.

16:59.509 --> 17:01.677
[camera beeps]
I have an idea.

17:02.912 --> 17:04.911
[squeals]

17:04.913 --> 17:07.480
You see what I mean, Mom? Mom...
Aw, come on. [sighs]

17:07.482 --> 17:09.784
Look, Kev, your dad said
no ocean for two weeks.

17:09.786 --> 17:12.219
I know, but we'll just go check things out.
No harm in that.

17:12.221 --> 17:14.921
Look, I'm sure the
dolphins are just fine.

17:14.923 --> 17:17.991
Mom, you know how sometimes you get
that feeling down in your belly?

17:17.992 --> 17:20.894
A really sad,
bad feeling?

17:20.896 --> 17:24.498
Sweetheart, what's the matter?
I've got that feeling.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.566
She's pretty good
about these things, Mom,

17:26.568 --> 17:28.704
I mean, in a strange
and weird way, but...

17:30.240 --> 17:31.842
Well...

17:32.808 --> 17:34.475
I guess she could
use a test run.

17:34.477 --> 17:36.480
Yes.
Yeah.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.815
[dad] That sure
is a beauty, sir.

17:40.817 --> 17:41.849
This is it.
Wow.

17:41.851 --> 17:43.484
Tell you what. You, uh...

17:43.486 --> 17:45.419
You take your family out
anytime you want.

17:45.421 --> 17:46.519
Really?
Sure.

17:46.521 --> 17:48.759
Oh, they would love that.

17:49.692 --> 17:51.627
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.

17:54.896 --> 17:55.932
Just look at it...

17:57.967 --> 17:59.866
the mystery, the power.

17:59.868 --> 18:02.705
Feel it?
Oh. Yeah.

18:03.573 --> 18:05.405
The ocean's a, uh...

18:05.407 --> 18:07.341
it's a mirror
of life, Ryan.

18:07.343 --> 18:09.309
It's always moving
and flowing.

18:09.311 --> 18:12.546
It's making its own path, just
like we make our own path.

18:12.548 --> 18:14.282
Mm, yes, sir.

18:14.284 --> 18:17.751
My wife's a bit more astute
about the water than I am.

18:17.753 --> 18:21.588
I married the daughter of a
fishing boat captain. [chuckles]

18:21.590 --> 18:25.361
It's... It's Abby, right? You say
she's finishing up her master's?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.827
Yeah, mechanical engineering.

18:27.829 --> 18:30.933
That's what I like about you, Bob.
I mean, you're a family man.

18:31.901 --> 18:33.467
You're a hard worker,
a competitor.

18:33.469 --> 18:35.369
Football man, right?
Yeah.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.771
All Gulf Conference, receiver
at North Central State.

18:37.773 --> 18:40.540
[chuckles] Oh, well...
Well, yeah.

18:40.542 --> 18:43.344
I, uh... I was
a baseball rat myself,

18:43.346 --> 18:47.347
played a year of semi-pro until I blew
out my left knee sliding to third.

18:47.349 --> 18:49.083
It's funny. You know,
it still aches sometimes.

18:49.085 --> 18:54.755
Oh, I feel you. I mean,
both my knees are squinky.

18:54.757 --> 18:56.657
You know the greatest thing
about sports?

18:56.659 --> 18:58.793
Teaches you not only
how to win,

18:58.795 --> 19:00.694
but that the team
comes first.

19:00.696 --> 19:02.896
That's so funny
that you say that.

19:02.898 --> 19:05.466
My old coach, Dunn,
that was his motto.

19:05.468 --> 19:09.339
- "Team first, men, always."
- That is a smart man.

19:10.472 --> 19:11.838
Why don't we take her out?

19:11.840 --> 19:14.343
I wanna...
I wanna show you something.

19:45.508 --> 19:47.507
This is where we hang out.
Pretty sweet, huh?

19:47.509 --> 19:49.546
Yeah. Hasn't changed
since I was a kid.

19:50.546 --> 19:52.680
Your granddad
used to bring me here.

19:52.682 --> 19:56.851
- I caught my first yellowtail right over there.
- Cool.

19:56.853 --> 19:59.556
- Yeah, I'm cooler than you thought, huh?
- [chuckles]

20:01.624 --> 20:02.655
[dolphin squealing]

20:02.657 --> 20:03.690
Look!
There they are!

20:03.692 --> 20:05.729
[clicking, squealing]

20:08.431 --> 20:09.700
[Kevin] See?
That's them.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.670
Yeah, you're right.
Really beautiful.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.141
There's only four.
Where is he, Kevin?

20:20.143 --> 20:21.776
Who?

20:21.778 --> 20:23.477
Holly's favorite.

20:23.479 --> 20:25.115
He's not here.

20:28.049 --> 20:30.453
[Holly] Come here, little buddy.
Where are you? Come here.

20:30.952 --> 20:32.519
Where are you?

20:32.521 --> 20:34.455
I knew he was lost.

20:34.457 --> 20:37.056
Uh, I'm sure he's fine.
He'll be back soon.

20:37.058 --> 20:39.794
What are we gonna do? [Kevin] Just let
us come back tomorrow, Mom, okay?

20:39.796 --> 20:42.563
We'll wear our life jackets. We'll sign in.
I promise. We'll do anything.

20:42.565 --> 20:45.699
We'll talk to your dad
about that, okay?

20:45.701 --> 20:47.804
We'll head home down the
coast, and see if we spot him.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.739
Where are you,
little buddy? Come on.

20:52.741 --> 20:54.043
Where are ya?

21:23.172 --> 21:25.541
[Mills] I brought you out here
for a reason, Ryan.

21:27.576 --> 21:29.977
You know, Mr. Mills,
I just, uh...

21:29.979 --> 21:32.645
I got a couple of questions
about this project.

21:32.647 --> 21:34.815
Could you, um, just cut
the formalities, Bob,

21:34.817 --> 21:36.749
and call me Winston?
Uh, yes, sir.

21:36.751 --> 21:38.084
[chuckles] Winston.

21:38.086 --> 21:41.755
So, uh, I've been waiting on the
final paperwork from Legal,

21:41.757 --> 21:44.257
and the attorneys have been
more tight-lipped about this

21:44.259 --> 21:46.026
than anything
I've ever seen.

21:46.028 --> 21:48.094
Yeah, well, I kind of
wanted it that way,

21:48.096 --> 21:50.264
'cause I'm dealing with some
heavy financial hitters,

21:50.266 --> 21:53.534
and they requested
total confidentiality.

21:53.536 --> 21:55.172
That's why I brought you
out here myself.

21:56.137 --> 21:57.872
See it? It's 102 acres

21:57.874 --> 22:00.574
of prime ocean-front
real estate.

22:00.576 --> 22:02.709
This is our little secret.

22:02.711 --> 22:05.112
Deal is we're building an
aquatic-themed ocean park.

22:05.114 --> 22:07.113
Oh, that's good. My kids
are gonna love the idea.

22:07.115 --> 22:09.249
They're on the water out in
these parts all the time.

22:09.251 --> 22:11.584
They're gonna be so excited.
Oh. [chuckles]

22:11.586 --> 22:14.188
- When's the big announcement?
- Well, that's the one hiccup.

22:14.190 --> 22:18.191
There's one piece of land right in the middle
of the property that we haven't secured yet.

22:18.193 --> 22:20.596
The owner's been
a stickler at selling,

22:21.297 --> 22:23.663
so, uh, clock's ticking.

22:23.665 --> 22:27.535
We got less than two weeks to lock
up the deal, or my investors walk.

22:27.537 --> 22:28.635
Who's the holdout?

22:28.637 --> 22:32.006
It's, um, some ex-NFL player.
He's...

22:32.008 --> 22:34.744
Grew up around here.
His name's Luke Lawson.

22:36.546 --> 22:38.481
Luke Lawson?
Yeah.

22:39.548 --> 22:42.115
[laughs] That was
my college quarterback.

22:42.117 --> 22:43.284
What?
Yeah.

22:43.286 --> 22:46.286
We were roommates
all of senior year.

22:46.288 --> 22:49.289
You gotta be kidding.
What a small world. Yeah.

22:49.291 --> 22:50.757
Do you... Do you think...

22:50.759 --> 22:52.625
I don't know... maybe
you could talk to him?

22:52.627 --> 22:55.028
Well, yeah. I tell you what.
You take the lead on this.

22:55.030 --> 22:57.698
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.700
Luke. I mean, we haven't been
in touch in recent years,

23:00.702 --> 23:02.672
but I can...
I can certainly try.

23:03.673 --> 23:04.738
Just at least
think it over.

23:04.740 --> 23:07.074
I mean, it's, uh...

23:07.076 --> 23:10.878
You know, we lose this piece
of land, the deal goes away.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.750
You know, and I promise you, you
will be rewarded handsomely.

23:23.259 --> 23:25.261
[clicking, whistling]

23:36.204 --> 23:38.774
[speaking French]

23:42.278 --> 23:44.010
Izzy speaking French again?

23:44.012 --> 23:46.646
Yep. He thinks he's European.

23:46.648 --> 23:48.083
[speaking French]

23:49.151 --> 23:52.251
Mom, Izzy wants
a new aquarium.

23:52.253 --> 23:54.054
Oh, he does, does he?

23:54.056 --> 23:57.357
Well, I think Monsieur Izzy
is being a little too greedy.

23:57.359 --> 24:00.059
Did you know that there are
over 40 species of dolphins,

24:00.061 --> 24:02.962
and some stay with their mama
until they're eight years old?

24:02.964 --> 24:08.768
No, I didn't know that, but it
doesn't surprise me that you do.

24:08.770 --> 24:11.805
Maybe saying a prayer for your little
friend might be a good idea, too.

24:11.807 --> 24:14.240
I already did.
Said two, just in case.

24:14.242 --> 24:17.813
But what about tomorrow?
Can we go look for him?

24:18.980 --> 24:20.648
I'll talk to your dad
when he gets home.

24:20.650 --> 24:21.414
Okay?

24:21.416 --> 24:22.749
We'll figure something out.

24:22.751 --> 24:23.886
Okay.
Right.

24:25.253 --> 24:27.156
Good night.
Good night, Mommy.

24:32.294 --> 24:34.130
Come on. Come on.

24:34.930 --> 24:38.297
Where you at? Come on.

24:38.299 --> 24:39.799
Ah, bingo. Bingo.

24:39.801 --> 24:42.335
All right. [sighs]

24:42.337 --> 24:44.074
Hang in there, little buddy.

25:04.192 --> 25:06.727
[snorts]

25:06.729 --> 25:08.898
[clicking]

25:12.468 --> 25:16.703
[clicking]

25:16.705 --> 25:18.207
[Bob] Whoo! I'm late.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.708
[sighs]
Morning, darling.

25:20.710 --> 25:21.877
Morning.

25:23.112 --> 25:25.849
So did you think about what
we talked about last night?

25:26.749 --> 25:27.715
I mean,
the kids, they're...

25:27.717 --> 25:29.382
they're really worried
about that dolphin.

25:29.384 --> 25:31.384
Abby, I don't get it.

25:31.386 --> 25:34.388
It's a dolphin. What are you
gonna do, put an APB out on it?

25:34.390 --> 25:39.093
No. I mean, it's just good that they care
about the ocean, the animals, you know?

25:39.095 --> 25:41.730
Of course. The Captain
taught you well.

25:43.898 --> 25:45.998
The most beautiful boat
mechanic in all the world.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.236
And I still say no
on the kayak, all right?

25:49.238 --> 25:51.471
Um, I'm gonna try
and come home early tonight

25:51.473 --> 25:53.742
so maybe we could
throw the football around.

25:54.876 --> 25:55.942
[door closes]

25:55.944 --> 25:58.378
So? So?
So?

25:58.380 --> 26:00.346
Are we out of jail?

26:00.348 --> 26:02.815
So that's why
I haven't seen you two?

26:02.817 --> 26:05.754
- Mm-hmm.
- Sneaky little boogers.

26:06.422 --> 26:07.955
So he still
says no kayaks,

26:07.957 --> 26:09.823
and I can't
take you out today.

26:09.825 --> 26:12.162
Promised Ms. Peters I'd look at her
freezer. It's on the fritz again.

26:12.894 --> 26:14.294
Bummer.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.996
Sorry, kiddos.

26:15.998 --> 26:18.931
I mean, your dad says
we can put out an APB.

26:18.933 --> 26:22.469
- What's an APB?
- [sighs] Just kidding, sweetheart. Bad joke.

26:22.471 --> 26:25.873
It's "all points bulletin."
Police use it to find bad guys.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.810
Yeah, or missing persons.

26:29.878 --> 26:31.411
Is this your dolphin?
[Kevin] Yeah.

26:31.413 --> 26:32.946
Can you make
more of these?

26:32.948 --> 26:34.784
Sure. Why?

26:35.483 --> 26:36.449
Make 50 copies.

26:36.451 --> 26:39.253
Oh, and add the word
"missing" at the top.

26:39.255 --> 26:40.853
Missing?

26:40.855 --> 26:42.826
And your phone number
at the bottom.

26:43.325 --> 26:44.557
But why the pho...

26:44.559 --> 26:47.427
I get it.
A real APB. Okay.

26:47.429 --> 26:49.365
Good job, Mom.

26:59.141 --> 27:00.974
[knocking]

27:00.976 --> 27:03.276
I, um, need your
signature on this.

27:03.278 --> 27:05.077
Okay.
Thanks.

27:05.079 --> 27:06.513
Just initial at the
bottom of page one,

27:06.515 --> 27:08.582
and then sign
the second page for me.

27:08.584 --> 27:11.285
Great. Want to tell me
what I'm signing?

27:11.287 --> 27:14.090
Oh, it's just
a standard NDA.

27:14.957 --> 27:16.390
Sandy...
Mm-hmm?

27:16.392 --> 27:18.424
I haven't signed
a nondisclosure

27:18.426 --> 27:20.994
on any project
since I've been here.

27:20.996 --> 27:24.030
Well, this deal's being structured
a little bit differently,

27:24.032 --> 27:27.867
and there's several
private parties involved,

27:27.869 --> 27:29.937
and it's just
what Winston wants, so...

27:29.939 --> 27:30.974
Right.

27:32.208 --> 27:35.074
Uh, Winston was wondering if
you reached out to Mr. Lawson

27:35.076 --> 27:36.910
about that land.

27:36.912 --> 27:39.212
No, but, um...

27:39.214 --> 27:41.280
but I'm gonna be
right on that.

27:41.282 --> 27:44.086
Okay, good, 'cause, uh,
Winston was asking.

27:46.288 --> 27:48.354
And just so you know,
by the way, um,

27:48.356 --> 27:52.359
the word around the office is that
you're up for Jack's old position, so...

27:52.361 --> 27:56.028
I'm just saying, VP would look nice
on that trophy case back there.

27:56.030 --> 27:58.265
[chuckles] Yes.
Yeah.

27:58.267 --> 27:59.568
Yes, it would.

28:02.171 --> 28:05.307
[up-tempo pop, woman singing]

28:46.448 --> 28:47.617
[singing ends]

28:53.122 --> 28:55.525
[sighing]

28:56.392 --> 28:58.193
Done.
This is the last one.

28:58.626 --> 29:00.427
All righty.

29:00.429 --> 29:01.694
It's been a long day.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.663
Uh-huh. Do you
think we'll find him?

29:03.665 --> 29:05.364
I don't know.

29:05.366 --> 29:06.501
We will.

29:07.303 --> 29:08.471
[exhales loudly]

29:10.338 --> 29:11.604
[Kevin]
Hey, Digger. Hey, Mikey.

29:11.606 --> 29:13.507
Oh, hey, Kevin. What
are you two up to?

29:13.509 --> 29:15.308
APB on a missing dolphin.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.678
That's crazy. How could you
just lose a dolphin?

29:17.680 --> 29:19.478
It's a big ocean.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.115
This is a good picture. Are you
guys, uh, still doing that movie?

29:23.117 --> 29:24.284
Yeah.
It's a documentary.

29:24.286 --> 29:25.584
Have you seen him?

29:25.586 --> 29:27.453
He's about this big.
[all chuckle]

29:27.455 --> 29:29.623
I've seen a lot
of dolphins today.

29:29.625 --> 29:33.226
- Yeah, one almost jumped in our boat.
- More than any fish did.

29:33.228 --> 29:34.561
That's for sure.

29:34.563 --> 29:36.363
You know, we saw the,
uh, Marineland truck

29:36.365 --> 29:38.632
loading something up about
a half-mile up the beach.

29:38.634 --> 29:40.566
I mean, what do you think?

29:40.568 --> 29:43.370
Yeah, it was a pretty good size.
Could have been a dolphin.

29:43.372 --> 29:44.638
It's him!
I just know it is!

29:44.640 --> 29:46.539
Okay. Thanks, Digger!
Thanks, Mikey!

29:46.541 --> 29:48.374
Yeah, uh, good-bye.
Good luck.

29:48.376 --> 29:49.544
No problem.

30:05.094 --> 30:06.526
[knocking]

30:06.528 --> 30:08.027
[Kevin]
Hello! Hello!

30:08.029 --> 30:09.528
[Holly] Help!
Please let us in!

30:09.530 --> 30:11.097
Sorry. We're closed
for the day.

30:11.099 --> 30:12.565
Opens at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

30:12.567 --> 30:16.004
[Holly] You gotta let us in!
You've got our dolphin!

30:19.575 --> 30:20.640
[chattering]

30:20.642 --> 30:22.709
And this is
our entire facility.

30:22.711 --> 30:24.344
We have 16 dolphins.

30:24.346 --> 30:26.680
Oh, and be careful around
the edge of the pool.

30:26.682 --> 30:28.681
The dolphin we rescued
is over here.

30:28.683 --> 30:30.417
Oh, see?
He's got a bad sunburn.

30:30.419 --> 30:33.019
Must have been
beached for hours.

30:33.021 --> 30:35.154
I didn't know dolphins
got sunburned.

30:35.156 --> 30:37.092
Well, look at that.
I'm putting that on tape.

30:38.124 --> 30:38.528
The nerd doesn't
know everything.

30:39.795 --> 30:41.728
Yeah, they're a lot
like us in many ways.

30:41.730 --> 30:43.529
So what's gonna
happen to him?

30:43.531 --> 30:48.035
Uh, we'll keep him here under
quarantine and evaluate his progress.

30:48.037 --> 30:49.369
[Holly] When can he
go back home?

30:49.371 --> 30:52.506
I don't know. That's if
we can even find his pod.

30:52.508 --> 30:55.574
We know where his family is.
How do you know that?

30:55.576 --> 30:57.346
They're our friends.
We swim with them.

30:58.747 --> 31:00.747
Oh, no, that's not good.

31:00.749 --> 31:02.114
Why not?

31:02.116 --> 31:05.786
Well, even though dolphins seem
to love interacting with humans,

31:05.788 --> 31:07.054
they are wild animals.

31:07.056 --> 31:08.488
They're protected by laws.

31:08.490 --> 31:11.357
If we can release him, you
can't swim with him again.

31:11.359 --> 31:12.726
Okay?

31:12.728 --> 31:15.261
They aren't pets.
Promise?

31:15.263 --> 31:17.264
- Promise.
- Promise.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.565
I just wish I knew
how he got stranded.

31:19.567 --> 31:20.834
It was this crazy
boat driver.

31:20.836 --> 31:22.401
He even flipped over
our kayak.

31:22.403 --> 31:24.371
Hmm. That makes sense.

31:24.373 --> 31:27.173
Probably got disoriented
and separated from his family.

31:27.175 --> 31:29.543
Boats, litter, pollution,

31:29.545 --> 31:32.778
many reasons we need to be more
responsible for our oceans.

31:32.780 --> 31:34.216
[cell phone chimes]

31:35.084 --> 31:36.315
It's Mom.

31:36.317 --> 31:37.686
We're late again.

31:39.121 --> 31:41.124
I knew it.
He's glad we're here.

31:42.257 --> 31:44.458
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Uh...

31:44.460 --> 31:46.328
Okay, I guess.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.630
Looks like someone
has a best friend.

31:50.632 --> 31:53.068
[chatters]

31:53.868 --> 31:56.138
[cell phone chimes]

31:57.205 --> 31:59.305
- They're on their way.
- Oh, fantastic.

31:59.307 --> 32:02.342
You know, I left work early just to
have a little Ryan fam bam time.

32:02.344 --> 32:04.344
I shouldn't have said
anything about the football.

32:04.346 --> 32:05.548
Maybe.

32:06.682 --> 32:08.317
You think I was
too tough on 'em?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.086
Perhaps.

32:12.453 --> 32:14.488
[sighs]
That's very nice.

32:14.490 --> 32:17.289
- We're gonna get you a tryout with Miami.
- [chuckles]

32:17.291 --> 32:20.262
I just want what's
best for us, you know?

32:21.497 --> 32:23.666
I'm gonna give them
everything that I never had.

32:25.267 --> 32:28.634
Abby, I really think that Winston's
gonna give me this VP slot.

32:28.636 --> 32:31.073
[gasps]
That'd be sweet.

32:32.307 --> 32:33.507
I mean,
I knew you'd get it!

32:33.509 --> 32:35.741
- I said, "Might." What are you...
- Whoo!

32:35.743 --> 32:37.579
[laughs]
[both moan]

32:38.579 --> 32:40.881
I am so proud of you,
Robert Ray Ryan.

32:40.883 --> 32:42.815
Nobody works
harder than you.

32:42.817 --> 32:45.317
I said, "Might."
He picked the right man.

32:45.319 --> 32:47.853
[chuckles]
Boy, well, let's hope.

32:47.855 --> 32:49.826
Oh, brother. Really, guys?
Out in the open?

32:50.625 --> 32:52.191
Guess what!
We found him!

32:52.193 --> 32:53.860
Yeah. We found him.
[laughs]

32:53.862 --> 32:56.666
That's amazing. Yes!
Come here.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.934
[Kevin on recording] So
what's gonna happen to him?

33:01.936 --> 33:05.171
[woman] Uh, we'll keep him here under
quarantine and evaluate his progress.

33:05.173 --> 33:07.407
[Holly] Isn't he the
coolest dolphin ever, Mom?

33:07.409 --> 33:10.544
Pretty cool. Handsome
fella, for sure.

33:10.546 --> 33:12.711
Yeah, I could edit this footage,
post it on the Internet,

33:12.713 --> 33:14.483
and let everybody
know we found him.

33:15.349 --> 33:18.584
[sighs]
So as I was saying,

33:18.586 --> 33:19.920
if your old man
gets this promotion,

33:19.922 --> 33:22.655
it could be a really, really
big deal for the whole family.

33:22.657 --> 33:24.824
That's awesome. That's awesome.
Yeah, cool.

33:24.826 --> 33:27.561
Mom, he's got
a spot on his back.

33:27.563 --> 33:30.363
Did you know dolphins
got sunburnt?

33:30.365 --> 33:33.199
All right, I can
shoot some more tomorrow.

33:33.201 --> 33:36.670
We can make a "save the dolphin" video.
Yeah. Yeah.

33:36.672 --> 33:40.507
Ooh, ooh! What I have to tell you
has to do with the dolphins, huh?

33:40.509 --> 33:42.976
Really?
Oh, now you're interested.

33:42.978 --> 33:44.643
How would
you kids feel

33:44.645 --> 33:48.347
about an ocean-themed
marine park, huh?

33:48.349 --> 33:52.621
A marine park where your father can get
as many family passes as he wants?

33:53.521 --> 33:55.721
A marine park?
Mm-hmm.

33:55.723 --> 33:56.789
With sea animals?

33:56.791 --> 33:58.691
With sea animals
and lots of rides,

33:58.693 --> 34:01.260
an ocean park,
and it'd be really cool,

34:01.262 --> 34:04.597
because it'll educate people
about the sea animals,

34:04.599 --> 34:07.433
and it will stimulate
the local economy.

34:07.435 --> 34:09.469
What do you think
about that, huh?

34:09.471 --> 34:11.306
Win-win for everyone.

34:12.541 --> 34:13.643
[sighs]

34:18.012 --> 34:19.911
You done?

34:19.914 --> 34:21.449
Almost.

34:22.384 --> 34:24.554
I don't like
that marine park idea.

34:25.652 --> 34:28.224
Yeah, I wish Dad wasn't
so excited about it.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.693
[beeps]
All right.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.362
Exporting.

34:35.463 --> 34:36.896
I'm kind of nervous
about this.

34:36.898 --> 34:39.833
I've never posted any of
my stuff online before.

34:39.835 --> 34:41.603
It's gonna be great, Kev.

34:42.402 --> 34:44.507
Yeah. Yeah.

34:45.873 --> 34:47.773
So nothing out
of the ordinary?

34:47.775 --> 34:50.043
No one snooping
around the property?

34:50.045 --> 34:52.746
No, sir, not today.

34:52.748 --> 34:55.483
I found a few more nests,
removed 'em.

34:57.052 --> 35:00.356
Good. Get 'em all.

35:01.289 --> 35:03.226
I do have something for you.

35:06.994 --> 35:07.862
[chuckles]

35:09.630 --> 35:12.298
Yeah, that looks like them.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.636
I found a campsite
set up near the cove.

35:16.003 --> 35:17.804
And?

35:17.806 --> 35:21.744
I made it pretty clear the
area can be very dangerous.

35:23.577 --> 35:27.416
You know, I, uh, can't have
any kids getting hurt.

35:29.016 --> 35:31.486
Who said anything
about them being hurt?

35:39.695 --> 35:43.095
[Holly] What are you doing to him?
Working on that sunburn.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.331
Good news is his blood work
came back good,

35:45.333 --> 35:47.333
so we'll keep him here
under quarantine

35:47.335 --> 35:48.770
to monitor his progress.

35:49.503 --> 35:51.403
What happens then?

35:51.405 --> 35:54.740
[sighs] Well, we'd like
to find his pod.

35:54.742 --> 35:56.443
This is a rare case
for Marineland.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.012
We aren't a rescue
and rehab facility.

35:59.014 --> 36:01.514
Our animals can't be
released back into the wild.

36:01.516 --> 36:03.416
They couldn't survive
without our care.

36:03.418 --> 36:05.552
We'll help you for free.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.119
[laughs]
[chatters]

36:07.121 --> 36:09.456
We are definitely short-staffed
with the new budget cuts,

36:09.458 --> 36:11.990
so I might just take you up
on that offer.

36:11.992 --> 36:14.394
Oh. All our other
dolphins have names.

36:14.396 --> 36:15.662
Does he have one?

36:15.664 --> 36:17.496
Well, hmm.

36:17.498 --> 36:18.764
[squealing]

36:18.766 --> 36:20.766
Since he has
a big sunburn,

36:20.768 --> 36:21.903
how about...

36:22.570 --> 36:23.702
Bernie?

36:23.704 --> 36:26.409
[laughs] I love it.
It's perfect.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.512
[Kevin] You know what?
I have an idea.

36:30.612 --> 36:32.315
[squealing, clicking]

36:32.914 --> 36:34.581
Interesting.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.882
This could help us.

36:35.884 --> 36:39.088
Uh, Kevin, can you record
his responses?

36:40.588 --> 36:42.121
Think you guys
could find his pod,

36:42.123 --> 36:43.722
play them Bernie's replies?

36:43.724 --> 36:45.594
Sure, and we could...

36:47.094 --> 36:49.662
We can't. We're grounded.
We can't be in the water.

36:49.664 --> 36:51.634
Yeah, right. Oops.

36:52.601 --> 36:53.766
I'll call your mom,

36:53.768 --> 36:55.168
I'll see what
I can do to help.

36:55.170 --> 36:58.604
Oh, but no swimming
with them. Promise?

36:58.606 --> 37:00.407
Pinky swear.
[squealing]

37:00.409 --> 37:02.474
[laughing]

37:02.476 --> 37:05.644
[all laughing]

37:05.646 --> 37:07.016
[Holly] Oh, Bernie.
[laughs]

37:09.684 --> 37:11.954
[Holly] I don't see
the dolphins.

37:14.556 --> 37:15.789
Maybe they're not here.

37:15.791 --> 37:19.525
No, they'll be here.
They won't leave Bernie.

37:19.527 --> 37:21.528
It's like you're part dolphin
or something.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.662
What's wrong with that?

37:22.664 --> 37:25.697
Nothing. I'm just saying.

37:25.699 --> 37:26.766
[water splashing]

37:26.768 --> 37:29.001
- Look! There they are!
- Oh, sweet.

37:29.003 --> 37:31.406
Play his video.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:32.106 --> 37:33.639
[Bernie clicking]

37:33.641 --> 37:35.810
It's working.
Look. Look at 'em.

37:36.177 --> 37:37.177
Yes.

37:37.179 --> 37:38.780
Awesome.

37:56.063 --> 37:57.229
This was good.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.833
Cool. We got some
awesome footage today.

37:59.835 --> 38:01.503
I'll edit it later.

38:02.603 --> 38:04.137
Let's call it,
"Bernie's Journey."

38:04.139 --> 38:06.873
Cool. Let's go get
some shots of the cove.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.508
There's always something
going on there.

38:08.510 --> 38:10.546
All right. Let's do it.

38:13.514 --> 38:15.514
Yeah, I'll go ahead
and edit that part out.

38:15.516 --> 38:16.648
Hey!

38:16.650 --> 38:18.887
[laughs]

38:20.255 --> 38:21.856
What's all this?

38:22.657 --> 38:25.191
No trees passing?

38:25.193 --> 38:26.796
It's "trespassing."

38:27.195 --> 38:28.862
No bueno.

38:28.864 --> 38:31.697
[men talking indistinctly]

38:31.699 --> 38:33.867
[man] I got all the city
board members convinced.

38:33.869 --> 38:36.068
Our final zoning vote
is this week.

38:36.070 --> 38:39.141
It will pass unanimously.

38:42.710 --> 38:45.043
You gonna stand there staring,
or tell me where we stand?

38:45.045 --> 38:46.579
It's them again.
[camera beeps]

38:46.581 --> 38:48.584
It just needs
a working...

38:49.818 --> 38:51.120
I'm gonna get 'em
this time.

38:52.186 --> 38:53.786
[beeps]

38:53.788 --> 38:55.722
Just need the last 10 acres.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.923
But Bob Ryan's working on it.
He's old friends with the owner.

38:57.925 --> 38:59.726
But...
Shh! Shh!

38:59.728 --> 39:01.193
- [man] Well, it better work.
- Quiet.

39:01.195 --> 39:04.030
We're in way too deep
for this thing to be exposed.

39:04.032 --> 39:05.898
Don't worry, Mayor.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.867
Within 18 months,

39:07.869 --> 39:09.869
we are gonna
be in business.

39:09.871 --> 39:11.970
If this thing all goes as
planned, might just catapult you

39:11.972 --> 39:14.206
into a run for
the governorship.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.108
Governor Brock Winters.

39:16.110 --> 39:17.712
That does have
a nice ring to it.

39:21.983 --> 39:23.316
Got 'em, Mr. Mills.

39:23.318 --> 39:24.050
Look. That one.

39:24.052 --> 39:26.920
Shh. Shh.
The speedboat guy.

39:26.922 --> 39:28.854
You sure that's
all of it, Jimmy?

39:28.856 --> 39:31.693
Yes, sir.
It's all I could find.

39:32.927 --> 39:33.996
What do I do with 'em?

39:35.630 --> 39:37.863
Just get it
far away from here.

39:37.865 --> 39:40.333
Those crazy environmental
nuts see those eggs,

39:40.335 --> 39:41.333
it'll cost us
millions in fines.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.869
Hey, why don't you
just take 'em home, Mills?

39:43.871 --> 39:46.572
Show 'em to your kids.
They might hatch.

39:46.574 --> 39:51.744
Hey, what do you think about
buying that fish hospital?

39:51.746 --> 39:53.579
Fish hospital?
Yeah.

39:53.581 --> 39:55.347
What, are you talking
about the marine habitat?

39:55.349 --> 39:59.619
Yeah, I guess they found
some sunburned dolphin.

39:59.621 --> 40:02.988
With the right press coverage, we could
turn it into a moneymaker, you know?

40:02.990 --> 40:05.791
Slimy fish gets new home, and
then you and I look like heroes.

40:05.793 --> 40:06.592
Hey. Hey, hey.

40:06.594 --> 40:08.230
[mayor] I like
the sound of that.

40:09.264 --> 40:11.764
Bernie's not a fish!
He's a mammal!

40:11.766 --> 40:14.601
And we're gonna put him back in
the ocean when he feels better.

40:14.603 --> 40:17.869
- It's time to go. Come on.
- And you guys are going to jail for taking those turtle eggs!

40:17.871 --> 40:20.907
Now you just hold on
a second, okay?

40:20.909 --> 40:22.374
No one's going to jail.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.276
I'm the mayor.
You've seen me on television.

40:24.278 --> 40:27.313
There's nothing
to worry about.

40:27.315 --> 40:30.249
Listen, I don't need
any problems, okay?

40:30.251 --> 40:33.820
Don't worry, Mr. Mayor.
There are no problems here.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.354
Besides, these two
are trespassing.

40:35.356 --> 40:37.255
- That's my camera! What are you doing?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:37.257 --> 40:41.327
And this is my property, and you...
Aren't you Bob Ryan's kids?

40:41.329 --> 40:43.128
Yeah, and we're gonna
tell our dad everything!

40:43.130 --> 40:44.831
No, you're not gonna tell
your dad anything,

40:44.833 --> 40:48.133
because if you do,
I'll fire him.

40:48.135 --> 40:52.037
And, uh... Where's
your proof now, right?

40:52.039 --> 40:55.874
Tell you what. Why don't you both get out
of here before I have you both arrested!

40:55.876 --> 40:57.679
Come on!
Go, go, go!

40:58.646 --> 41:00.380
Not good, Mills.

41:00.382 --> 41:02.280
Need to lock this up.

41:02.282 --> 41:04.953
I'll take care of it, okay?
Get rid of that.

41:07.222 --> 41:08.757
I'll take care of it.

41:14.396 --> 41:15.894
[Bob] How long has it been,
10 years?

41:15.896 --> 41:17.130
[man] Longer.
Since your wedding.

41:17.132 --> 41:18.930
No, has it been that long? Yeah.

41:18.932 --> 41:20.133
Oh, man.
[laughs]

41:20.135 --> 41:21.668
Time flies.

41:21.670 --> 41:23.269
I gotta admit
I was a little jealous

41:23.271 --> 41:25.972
I wasn't the one catching
all those touchdowns.

41:25.974 --> 41:27.206
Hey, I just got lucky.

41:27.208 --> 41:30.075
Besides, you made me look
good, helped me get drafted.

41:30.077 --> 41:32.378
Oh. [laughs]
Yeah, right.

41:32.380 --> 41:33.845
Big Gun Law.

41:33.847 --> 41:35.815
You just had that
touch, you know?

41:35.817 --> 41:38.217
Always hit us
right in the numbers.

41:38.219 --> 41:39.887
Hey, sorry
I lost touch, R.R.

41:41.088 --> 41:43.423
Bouncing around the league
for 13 seasons,

41:43.425 --> 41:44.856
then wrecking my shoulder.

41:44.858 --> 41:46.258
One day, you're on
the field playing.

41:46.260 --> 41:49.398
The next day, you realize,
never play again.

41:50.764 --> 41:51.630
[Bob laughs]

41:51.632 --> 41:53.166
I wouldn't be
complaining too much.

41:53.168 --> 41:54.867
It looks like
you're doing all right.

41:54.869 --> 41:56.302
I mean,
what would Coach say?

41:56.304 --> 41:57.737
[mimicking]
"It's not how you start.

41:57.739 --> 41:59.137
It's how you finish,
dang it, Lawson."

41:59.139 --> 42:01.840
Oh, you sound just like him now.
[laughs]

42:01.842 --> 42:03.842
Doosh.
Enough about me.

42:03.844 --> 42:06.813
What's going on with you, Abby? I
hear you got two kids now, right?

42:06.815 --> 42:08.347
I mean, Abby's great.

42:08.349 --> 42:09.949
She's getting her master's.

42:09.951 --> 42:12.385
Kevin's 11. Holly's 9.

42:12.387 --> 42:14.887
They're both geniuses
like their mom,

42:14.889 --> 42:18.291
though, uh, Kevin's not
so much into football.

42:18.293 --> 42:20.059
Can't even get him
to play catch with me.

42:20.061 --> 42:23.798
Ah, give him time. Probably
late bloomers, like you.

42:25.365 --> 42:27.201
So glad you found me, R.R.

42:29.003 --> 42:32.405
So you mentioned my property
on the phone earlier.

42:32.407 --> 42:36.208
I had a real-estate firm try to buy
it from me a couple months back,

42:36.210 --> 42:38.376
but don't much like
the guy I talked to, though.

42:38.378 --> 42:41.847
Yeah, right. That's, uh, Winston Mills.
That's my boss.

42:41.849 --> 42:46.385
Hmm. I don't know, R.R. He just
seemed a little too slick for me.

42:46.387 --> 42:49.421
Look, I think the deal
could be good for you.

42:49.423 --> 42:51.224
It's definitely
a positive for the city,

42:51.226 --> 42:53.959
but the last thing I'm here
to do is hard-sell you.

42:53.961 --> 42:55.295
[scoffs] I'm gonna
show you the plans

42:55.297 --> 43:00.166
- after I... finish kicking your butt right now.
- Tell you what.

43:00.168 --> 43:03.405
You sink that next bag,
you got yourself a deal.

43:04.204 --> 43:06.139
Sure you wanna do that?

43:06.141 --> 43:08.106
Why not?
Like old times, right?

43:08.108 --> 43:09.944
Wow.
[laughs]

43:10.811 --> 43:11.746
Fine.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.148
[sighs]

43:18.887 --> 43:21.320
Ooh! Ooh!
[boat horn blows]

43:21.322 --> 43:23.057
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

43:58.860 --> 44:01.394
Why didn't you tell them off? You
could have helped me, you know?

44:01.396 --> 44:03.766
We just ran like
little scaredy-cats.

44:05.900 --> 44:09.037
You're right. Giving all
this stuff away. What?

44:10.038 --> 44:11.539
I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

44:13.106 --> 44:15.106
I'm done.

44:15.108 --> 44:17.142
So what, are you
just gonna give up?

44:17.144 --> 44:19.380
No camera, no more films.

44:20.347 --> 44:22.514
When did you
become such a baby?

44:22.516 --> 44:24.316
We just need to get
your camera back.

44:24.318 --> 44:26.952
That footage
could save Bernie

44:26.954 --> 44:29.391
and put those bad guys
in jail.

44:31.525 --> 44:34.059
The camera's gone,
and they're not our pets.

44:34.061 --> 44:35.427
All right? We caused this.

44:35.429 --> 44:38.866
You're right. They're not our
pets, but they are our friends.

44:48.175 --> 44:51.344
[Holly clapping slowly]

44:51.346 --> 44:55.483
[Holly clapping rapidly]
He's so fast.

44:56.150 --> 44:57.885
Go, Bernie! Go!

45:00.021 --> 45:01.354
[giggles]

45:01.356 --> 45:03.322
Wow. He looks great.

45:03.324 --> 45:07.829
Yeah. We should be able to
release him soon. Cool, huh?

45:09.429 --> 45:11.329
[Holly]
Hey, little buddy.

45:11.331 --> 45:12.264
[squeals]

45:12.266 --> 45:14.432
Here.
[clicking]

45:14.434 --> 45:16.469
[chatters]
[clicking continues]

45:16.471 --> 45:19.007
[laughs]
[snorts]

45:19.539 --> 45:21.641
[clicking]

45:21.643 --> 45:23.177
[chatters]

45:27.481 --> 45:31.052
Yay! Wow, look at him go.
He sure is happy.

45:32.052 --> 45:34.589
Bernie's video
has over 10,000 views.

45:36.958 --> 45:39.458
Hey, what's the matter, kiddo?

45:39.460 --> 45:42.128
Your footage is a hit. You
should be doing cartwheels.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.362
That's what I told him.
Be happy, like Bernie.

45:44.364 --> 45:46.465
[chatters]

45:46.467 --> 45:49.267
Hey, so what's the deal?
Where's your camera?

45:49.269 --> 45:51.405
[Bernie chatters]

45:53.041 --> 45:55.043
All right, somebody
better start talking.

45:56.311 --> 45:57.709
[Bernie chatters]

45:57.711 --> 46:00.012
Okay, I'll just call your mom.

46:00.014 --> 46:01.313
No, no, no.
No, don't. No.

46:01.315 --> 46:02.648
[chatters]

46:02.650 --> 46:04.516
Yeah, I can't help you
if I don't know how.

46:04.518 --> 46:07.253
There's nothing
anybody can do right now.

46:07.255 --> 46:10.222
[Bernie chatters] Our dad's boss and
the mayor, they're trying to...

46:10.224 --> 46:13.159
- Stop! Stop it! Stop it, Holly, right now.
- We need help, Kevin.

46:13.161 --> 46:15.264
You pinky promise
you won't tell?

46:16.496 --> 46:17.396
[chatters]

46:17.398 --> 46:19.465
[Mills] Well, yes,
I'm very interested.

46:19.467 --> 46:22.300
So it is for sale, then?
Then let's do it.

46:22.302 --> 46:24.336
All right, make...
make the offer.

46:24.338 --> 46:26.072
[rhythmic knocking]

46:26.074 --> 46:28.606
Hey, look, I gotta go.

46:28.608 --> 46:32.146
You make sure you get that offer in
before the end of the day, okay?

46:33.280 --> 46:34.916
Come in.

46:38.052 --> 46:39.751
Bob.

46:39.753 --> 46:42.690
Ah, successful meeting, I hope?
Well... [sighs]

46:45.126 --> 46:50.132
Got him to sign, and, uh,
I had him initial every page.

46:51.632 --> 46:55.034
This is, um...
This is well done.

46:55.036 --> 46:58.204
You are really something,
Bob Ryan.

46:58.206 --> 47:01.710
Ah, I'm just trying
to do my part, sir.

47:03.077 --> 47:04.175
Oh, please have a seat.

47:04.177 --> 47:05.547
Oh. Thank you.

47:10.150 --> 47:13.052
Ah. My kids have
that same camera.

47:13.054 --> 47:14.552
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I've...

47:14.554 --> 47:16.521
You know, I've had that thing forever.
My kids love to...

47:16.523 --> 47:18.023
They love
to fool around with it.

47:18.025 --> 47:21.293
You know, you! You scored
a touchdown, Bob Ryan.

47:21.295 --> 47:27.266
Or should I say... Mr. Vice President
of Commercial Acquisitions?

47:27.268 --> 47:29.101
Thank you, sir.

47:29.103 --> 47:31.306
It's a big job.
I know you can handle it.

47:32.072 --> 47:33.238
[exhales]

47:33.240 --> 47:36.474
[laughs] I mean,
you have no idea

47:36.476 --> 47:40.179
how much this means to me
and to Abby and the kids.

47:40.181 --> 47:41.780
Um... [laughs]

47:41.782 --> 47:43.416
You know,
talking about your kids,

47:43.418 --> 47:46.418
I ran into them yesterday
down at the cove,

47:46.420 --> 47:49.121
and it seems like
we had a slight...

47:49.123 --> 47:50.423
...misunderstanding.

47:50.425 --> 47:52.191
Maybe you
just heard them wrong.

47:52.193 --> 47:56.729
No, they said they'd fire Dad,
then buy Marineland.

47:56.731 --> 47:57.796
[chatters] [woman]
Buy Marineland?

47:57.798 --> 48:00.499
Yeah and they have the mayor
on their side, too.

48:00.501 --> 48:02.601
They're really
mean people, Sidney.

48:02.603 --> 48:05.237
I mean really,
really bad people.

48:05.239 --> 48:07.606
- [chatters]
- But we have to tell your parents.

48:07.608 --> 48:11.242
We can't. They said they'd fire Dad.
But listen. We got this.

48:11.244 --> 48:14.579
Mom and Dad always said we gotta be
responsible for our own actions, all right?

48:14.581 --> 48:18.184
We got ourselves in this mess.
We can get out.

48:18.186 --> 48:20.452
[chatters] [Holly] We'll do
the best we can, Bernie.

48:20.454 --> 48:22.423
Just hang in there.
[Bernie squeals]

48:24.157 --> 48:25.159
[Holly laughs]
[chatters]

48:27.561 --> 48:32.130
- Hey. There you are. How's Bernie?
- Better.

48:32.132 --> 48:34.833
He's eating a lot, and Sidney
says we can release him soon.

48:34.835 --> 48:37.336
Well, that's good news, yeah?

48:37.338 --> 48:39.106
Hand me the pliers, please.

48:41.708 --> 48:44.578
So, uh, what's with
the long faces?

48:46.514 --> 48:47.548
Mom...

48:48.715 --> 48:50.449
what if somebody
was doing something

48:50.451 --> 48:51.786
really, really wrong?

48:53.253 --> 48:56.525
Would you tell? Even if
they told you not to?

48:57.257 --> 48:58.460
That depends.

49:00.128 --> 49:01.763
What'd you guys do now?

49:04.532 --> 49:06.197
Um...

49:06.199 --> 49:07.800
Dad's boss, Mr. Mills,

49:07.802 --> 49:11.537
uh, he...

49:11.539 --> 49:13.805
Uh, he, um...
He what?

49:13.807 --> 49:15.708
He's not gonna build
an ocean theme park.

49:15.710 --> 49:18.213
[sliding door opens]
[Bob] Hey, kids.

49:19.313 --> 49:21.847
Kevin, what do you say
we grab the old pigskin

49:21.849 --> 49:23.916
and I teach you
the five-step drop?

49:23.918 --> 49:26.485
Because to succeed
in this life,

49:26.487 --> 49:27.920
you must go deep.

49:27.922 --> 49:31.559
Seems that they got
something to tell us, right?

49:32.460 --> 49:33.327
Dad...

49:34.795 --> 49:36.729
Mr. Mills is not gonna
build an ocean park.

49:36.731 --> 49:39.164
Mr. Mills told me that, uh,

49:39.166 --> 49:41.233
you overheard him
speaking with the mayor.

49:41.235 --> 49:44.670
Kids, he was talking about a
completely different project.

49:44.672 --> 49:46.704
Dad, he's lying, okay?
He said he'd fire you.

49:46.706 --> 49:48.673
Oh, he's lying? Is that right?
[both] Yeah.

49:48.675 --> 49:50.208
Well, that's...
that's interesting,

49:50.210 --> 49:52.213
because I just
kinda got promoted.

49:53.713 --> 49:55.548
You're looking
at the new VP.

49:55.550 --> 49:59.450
- That's great, hon. I'm so proud of you!
- Yes. [Bob laughs]

49:59.452 --> 50:01.519
Mmm! It is a big day
for the Ryans.

50:01.521 --> 50:03.923
Uh, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get changed.

50:03.925 --> 50:06.358
We're gonna take out
the Ryan Express,

50:06.360 --> 50:07.863
and I'm gonna
show you the spot.

50:10.231 --> 50:12.932
You see? Your dad knows
what he's doing, okay?

50:12.934 --> 50:15.470
It'll all work out.
Okay.

50:16.204 --> 50:18.140
[engine whirring]

50:24.311 --> 50:25.677
[Bob] There is it, kids.
Right there.

50:25.679 --> 50:27.412
Right on that piece
of land right there.

50:27.414 --> 50:30.715
That's where a massive
ocean park is gonna go.

50:30.717 --> 50:35.253
It's gonna have rides,
water slides.

50:35.255 --> 50:36.956
You're gonna love it.

50:36.958 --> 50:38.791
Uh, but, honey,
this is the kids' hangout.

50:38.793 --> 50:40.659
You sure this is it?
'Course I am, honey.

50:40.661 --> 50:42.628
Winston brought me
out here personally.

50:42.630 --> 50:44.398
[dolphins chattering]
Look. There they are.

50:45.465 --> 50:46.798
[Kevin] Tell them
Bernie's okay.

50:46.800 --> 50:50.235
Guys, Bernie's fine.
We found him, okay?

50:50.237 --> 50:52.371
He got beached,
and he's just sunburned,

50:52.373 --> 50:54.405
but he's fine now.

50:54.407 --> 50:56.608
Kev, where's your camera? You
can get some shots for Bernie.

50:56.610 --> 50:59.278
Um, I'm just
gonna use my phone.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.949
You don't have
your camera, Kev?

51:02.282 --> 51:04.516
- No.
- That's funny, you know?

51:04.518 --> 51:06.688
Winston has a camera
just like yours.

51:09.724 --> 51:11.757
All right.
Let's go in.

51:11.759 --> 51:13.659
I'm excited to show you
the lay of the land.

51:13.661 --> 51:15.427
[engine starts]

51:15.429 --> 51:18.867
[pop song, woman singing]

51:26.373 --> 51:27.641
[singing ends]

51:31.545 --> 51:33.811
[Kevin] Come on.
We're almost there.

51:33.813 --> 51:36.782
[Bob] Wait a minute, you guys.
I'm the tour guide here.

51:36.784 --> 51:38.816
Right there, that's...
that's our...

51:38.818 --> 51:40.688
What happened?
It's gone!

51:41.789 --> 51:43.491
Someone took all our stuff.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.461
[Kevin] What?

51:50.998 --> 51:52.434
Oh, no! The eggs!

51:53.668 --> 51:54.599
Holly!

51:54.601 --> 51:56.370
Where is everybody going?

51:58.306 --> 51:59.507
That's it, bud.

52:00.807 --> 52:03.075
Oh, and by the way, Winston
says no more coming down here,

52:03.077 --> 52:05.744
'cause once we start construction,
it could be dangerous.

52:05.746 --> 52:06.912
Um, Dad, uh...

52:06.914 --> 52:08.780
Isn't it something, huh?

52:08.782 --> 52:11.252
Yes, sir,
it's something, all right.

52:13.721 --> 52:15.688
We found them.
They're there.

52:15.690 --> 52:18.490
You found what?
Am I missing something here?

52:18.492 --> 52:21.693
- Mr. Winston's gonna...
- Gonna save the turtle eggs, Dad, right?

52:21.695 --> 52:23.829
Yes, of course, kids. We're gonna
be ecologically conscious.

52:23.831 --> 52:27.032
Yeah. Yeah, we'll stay away
from here from now on, Dad.

52:27.034 --> 52:29.903
That's good.
So that's it.

52:30.905 --> 52:32.704
Over here is gonna be
the entrance.

52:32.706 --> 52:35.773
And then,
Holly, over here,

52:35.775 --> 52:38.980
that's gonna be
a 50-foot water slide.

52:40.614 --> 52:41.882
[sighs]

52:43.583 --> 52:45.486
[chimes ringing]

52:50.824 --> 52:52.693
[owl hoots]

52:59.733 --> 53:01.869
Those kids of yours
are quiet tonight.

53:03.403 --> 53:04.769
Too quiet.

53:04.771 --> 53:09.807
Ab, you know I only want what's
best for you and the kids, right?

53:09.809 --> 53:11.346
Of course I do, honey.

53:12.012 --> 53:13.644
And the kids
know that, too.

53:13.646 --> 53:16.817
Sometimes I think
I just try too hard.

53:18.952 --> 53:20.686
Met with Luke Lawson today.

53:20.688 --> 53:22.054
Luke Lawson?
Mm-hmm.

53:22.056 --> 53:23.956
I haven't heard you
mention him in years.

53:23.958 --> 53:26.758
I didn't even know
that he was back in town.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.630
He owned some land
that we need for the park.

53:30.898 --> 53:32.731
I got him to sell.

53:32.733 --> 53:34.133
Well, that's good.

53:34.135 --> 53:35.637
You did your job.

53:37.070 --> 53:38.670
What's wrong?

53:38.672 --> 53:40.608
I know that look.

53:41.708 --> 53:44.943
Just brought back memories,
you know?

53:44.945 --> 53:47.713
I mean, sports has
always been my marker.

53:47.715 --> 53:51.115
It's how I judge success.

53:51.117 --> 53:52.953
I'm old-school.

53:53.853 --> 53:56.088
And our kids,
they're just, um...

53:56.090 --> 53:57.392
They're different.

53:58.458 --> 54:00.025
You know, seeing Holly
out there today

54:00.027 --> 54:02.561
with the dolphins.
[laughs]

54:02.563 --> 54:04.796
I mean, it was so cute.

54:04.798 --> 54:07.699
And I actually think that she
was communicating with them.

54:07.701 --> 54:09.938
You know,
I think that she was.

54:10.905 --> 54:12.503
Kevin with his filmmaking,

54:12.505 --> 54:16.810
I... haven't exactly
been supportive.

54:18.445 --> 54:21.546
It's no secret that I'm trying
to turn him into a ballplayer,

54:21.548 --> 54:25.217
but... I don't know
if that's right.

54:25.219 --> 54:28.086
Yeah, and maybe he
will be a ballplayer.

54:28.088 --> 54:31.123
They got a lot
of growing up to do.

54:31.125 --> 54:33.925
We teach them
the best that we can

54:33.927 --> 54:36.128
and pray that they make
the right choices.

54:36.130 --> 54:37.465
Oh, you're right.

54:38.798 --> 54:40.932
You're always right.

54:40.934 --> 54:43.034
I would never admit that
in public...

54:43.036 --> 54:44.605
Yeah.
...of course, but...

54:45.840 --> 54:49.443
[sighs] Some things
never change.

54:58.686 --> 55:02.054
So what'd you do that for? You know
they aren't saving any turtles.

55:02.056 --> 55:03.856
It's okay.
I have a plan.

55:03.858 --> 55:05.923
All right, so this is
Dad's office building.

55:05.925 --> 55:08.630
He said Winston has the
camera, my camera.

55:09.195 --> 55:10.662
Yeah. So?

55:10.664 --> 55:12.798
So, it's
in Winston's office.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.769
Oh, no. We both know
what he's thinking, right?

55:16.737 --> 55:17.970
It's the only way.

55:17.972 --> 55:20.108
Without the camera,
the bad guys win.

55:24.077 --> 55:26.547
[clicking]

55:28.681 --> 55:31.018
[squeals]

56:02.615 --> 56:03.684
[shutter clicks]

56:12.192 --> 56:14.094
[chattering]

56:16.764 --> 56:19.731
Can I help? Uh, yeah, sure.
Grab that bucket over there.

56:19.733 --> 56:21.769
Sure. It's time to feed Bernie.

56:27.307 --> 56:29.874
Ew. Dead fish.

56:29.876 --> 56:32.209
What'd you expect,
spaghetti?

56:32.211 --> 56:34.079
[squeaks]

56:34.081 --> 56:36.113
So the post
really worked, huh?

56:36.115 --> 56:40.588
Yep. We're getting well wishes from
countries all around the world.

56:40.987 --> 56:42.289
[chatters]

56:44.757 --> 56:49.061
- Okay, what's wrong?
- I think we caused all this mess.

56:49.063 --> 56:50.595
Hey, no, stop.

56:50.597 --> 56:52.130
You two helped save Bernie

56:52.132 --> 56:54.099
and learned a valuable
lesson about the ocean.

56:54.101 --> 56:56.867
I don't think he would have
survived without you guys.

56:56.869 --> 56:59.070
- [chatters]
- How'd it go with Mom and Dad?

56:59.072 --> 57:00.838
You tell them?

57:00.840 --> 57:02.608
Kind of.

57:02.610 --> 57:04.376
What's "kind of" mean?

57:04.378 --> 57:06.744
Means Dad got
a big promotion

57:06.746 --> 57:08.947
and thinks his boss
is super awesome.

57:08.949 --> 57:11.016
Well, that stinks.

57:11.018 --> 57:12.720
Want me
to talk to them?

57:13.621 --> 57:14.753
- Well...
- [chatters]

57:14.755 --> 57:17.789
The good news is the plan
is to release Bernie soon.

57:17.791 --> 57:19.791
Yeah, unless Winston
buys the place first.

57:19.793 --> 57:21.258
- [squeals]
- What was that?

57:21.260 --> 57:24.865
Nothing. Let's go. We got work to do.
Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Work to do.

57:28.702 --> 57:31.336
Something sure smells fishy
around here, Bernie,

57:31.338 --> 57:33.141
and it ain't the fish.

57:35.309 --> 57:37.111
[squeaks]

57:40.681 --> 57:42.349
[door hinges creak]

57:59.132 --> 58:00.867
[drawer closes]

58:05.438 --> 58:08.440
[door opens, closes]

58:08.442 --> 58:12.209
[sighs] I really need your
help on this one, Big Guy.

58:12.211 --> 58:13.811
If you just do me
this one favor,

58:13.813 --> 58:18.182
I promise I won't
ask you for anything else.

58:18.184 --> 58:21.788
Well, hope I won't have
to ask you for anything else.

58:22.956 --> 58:24.258
[footsteps approaching]

58:27.760 --> 58:29.197
Kev, you asleep?

58:31.831 --> 58:33.835
Sweet dreams.
Love you.

58:34.967 --> 58:36.403
[door closes]

58:49.782 --> 58:52.052
[whirring]

58:53.186 --> 58:54.688
[door opens]

58:59.793 --> 59:00.958
Going somewhere?

59:00.960 --> 59:02.360
Gotta get my camera.

59:02.362 --> 59:03.394
You crazy?

59:03.396 --> 59:04.862
Maybe.

59:04.864 --> 59:07.099
Well, I'm coming with you.

59:07.101 --> 59:08.800
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

59:08.802 --> 59:11.403
Come on, listen.
All right, you just go...

59:11.405 --> 59:13.037
What are you doing?

59:13.039 --> 59:14.805
I got Dad's skills.

59:14.807 --> 59:17.144
So are we doing this
or what?

59:18.077 --> 59:19.478
All right.

59:19.480 --> 59:22.179
So according to Dad's schedule, the
cleaning crew starts at 10:00.

59:22.181 --> 59:25.950
All right, I'll, uh...
set this thing for 9:55.

59:25.952 --> 59:30.822
If we're lucky, we'll be able to
get in and out in 15 minutes tops.

59:30.824 --> 59:32.193
All right.

59:32.893 --> 59:33.894
[tires squealing]

59:49.976 --> 59:51.075
[tires screech]

59:51.077 --> 59:53.211
[sighs] Oh, no.
No, no, no.

59:53.213 --> 59:55.347
Come on, go! Go! Go now!

59:55.349 --> 59:57.481
I can't. I can't.
Why not?

59:57.483 --> 59:59.217
It's a red light.

59:59.219 --> 01:00:01.253
[dog barking]

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:02.820
Really? Look.

01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:05.123
Anybody? Listen,
we don't have that much time.

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.291
Do you wanna get
in more trouble?

01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:07.793
All right?
The law's the law.

01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:09.094
I can't do nothin' about it.

01:00:09.096 --> 01:00:10.862
Oh, brother.

01:00:10.864 --> 01:00:12.400
[dog barking continues]

01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:14.465
Yes.
Here we go.

01:00:14.467 --> 01:00:16.136
[tires squeal]

01:00:27.114 --> 01:00:28.483
[lock clicks]

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:43.898
[whispering]
All right, let's go.

01:01:20.934 --> 01:01:23.869
[door opens, closes]

01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:26.503
[ringtone plays]

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.507
Hello.

01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:30.041
Oh, Mayor Winter. Hey.

01:01:30.043 --> 01:01:32.947
How did the, uh...
How'd the vote go tonight?

01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:36.918
Really? Well,
that's spectacular.

01:01:37.483 --> 01:01:39.886
That's good news indeed.

01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:43.291
Yeah.
What, it was unanimous?

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.657
It's him.
We gotta go.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.392
I gotta get my camera.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:52.898
Mayor, how many times
have I told you not to worry?

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.266
I mean, with income
you're gonna see...

01:01:54.268 --> 01:01:56.133
Oh, no.
...from the chemical plant...

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:58.003
Chuck's on the loose.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.137
- Why'd you bring him?
- For backup.

01:02:00.139 --> 01:02:02.106
- [croaks]
- [Mills] Yes, yes.

01:02:02.108 --> 01:02:05.309
What? Oh, no. Yeah, I've got the
signed documents right here.

01:02:05.311 --> 01:02:09.046
Yeah. Bob Ryan, he pulled it off.
[laughs]

01:02:09.048 --> 01:02:11.416
Oh, the... the poor sucker.

01:02:11.418 --> 01:02:12.854
[chuckles]

01:02:31.938 --> 01:02:33.371
All right.

01:02:33.373 --> 01:02:36.074
Please be unlocked.
Please be unlocked.

01:02:36.076 --> 01:02:37.108
[knob rattles]

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.376
Yes. Yes.
Yes.

01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:40.181
[hinges creak]

01:02:54.427 --> 01:02:56.429
[hinges creak]

01:03:03.737 --> 01:03:05.940
Sweet! Yes.

01:03:07.007 --> 01:03:08.943
[door opens] Oh, come on.
Come on.

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:15.282
[mutters]
Ah, there you are.

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.438
[Holly]
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:40.074
Well, well.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.441
Look who can't
stay out of trouble.

01:03:43.443 --> 01:03:47.512
Juvenile delinquents.
Your dad will be so, so proud.

01:03:47.514 --> 01:03:50.315
Oh, and you're
thieves as well.

01:03:50.317 --> 01:03:53.050
Run, run, run.
Go, go, go, go. Go.

01:03:53.052 --> 01:03:54.184
[door opens]

01:03:54.186 --> 01:03:55.556
[chuckles]

01:03:56.989 --> 01:04:00.791
You know that, uh, breaking and
entering is a very serious offense.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:02.760
No, you're the one
that's in trouble.

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:03.730
I don't think so.

01:04:09.268 --> 01:04:10.337
[groans]

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.309
Bye. It was so good seeing you.
You, too.

01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:19.543
We'll do it again, okay? Yes!

01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:20.547
Give me a call.
See ya.

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:24.382
[dog barking]

01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:25.652
[car alarm chirps]

01:04:26.619 --> 01:04:29.186
[panting]

01:04:29.188 --> 01:04:31.389
- Help! Help! He's after us!
- Holly?

01:04:31.391 --> 01:04:33.191
We have the evidence.
Evidence? I...

01:04:33.193 --> 01:04:35.492
Let me see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

01:04:35.494 --> 01:04:37.295
All right, just calm down.
Who's after you?

01:04:37.297 --> 01:04:38.695
Him! He's after us!
There he is!

01:04:38.697 --> 01:04:41.432
That is my camera!

01:04:41.434 --> 01:04:43.467
Thank you. Thank you
for stopping these...

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:44.504
these thieving kids!

01:04:45.505 --> 01:04:47.704
You're chasing
children, sir?

01:04:47.706 --> 01:04:50.675
Hey, they broke in
to my office.

01:04:50.677 --> 01:04:52.709
These are the Ryans' kids.

01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:54.248
I think you know them.

01:04:56.182 --> 01:04:57.715
Bob Ryan's kids?

01:04:57.717 --> 01:05:00.485
Oh, wow, I had no idea.

01:05:00.487 --> 01:05:02.420
I mean, come on. Look at
the way they're dressed.

01:05:02.422 --> 01:05:04.588
It was in my office.
It was dark.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:07.391
You know who we are, all right, and
we have you and the mayor on tape.

01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:08.860
What are you talking about?

01:05:08.862 --> 01:05:12.229
Look, look, now that I know who you
are, I think it's a little late.

01:05:12.231 --> 01:05:14.199
You know, I'm a little
concerned about their safety.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.767
- I'm gonna take 'em home.
- No. I'll take them home.

01:05:16.769 --> 01:05:19.838
Sure. That's a good idea. I'm just
gonna take my camera, thank you.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.175
Do not touch them!

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:24.108
[gasps]
What did you do?

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:24.943
Oh, my goodness.
That is a...

01:05:24.945 --> 01:05:26.711
That's a shame.
Isn't that a shame?

01:05:26.713 --> 01:05:28.378
It really, truly is.
I'll tell you what.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.516
I'm gonna pay
for your phone, okay?

01:05:31.518 --> 01:05:34.251
And I think this should
more than cover it.

01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.619
They were right.

01:05:35.621 --> 01:05:37.357
You are a mean man.

01:05:38.391 --> 01:05:39.824
Uh, so, um...
That's my camera!

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:41.793
No, we've been
through this before.

01:05:41.795 --> 01:05:44.329
All right, uh, you just make
sure to tell your father

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:46.463
I want to see him first thing
in the morning, okay?

01:05:46.465 --> 01:05:48.398
[grunts]
Big meanie!

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.534
I saw that.

01:05:49.536 --> 01:05:50.604
Let's go.

01:05:59.813 --> 01:06:02.479
[Sidney] They're safe.
That's all that matters.

01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:05.782
Thank you for taking care of them.
Abby, it wasn't their fault.

01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:09.454
Mr. Ryan's boss,
he's not a nice man.

01:06:09.456 --> 01:06:12.423
Broke Kevin's camera
and my phone, too.

01:06:12.425 --> 01:06:15.296
Oh. I'm sorry, Sidney.

01:06:16.295 --> 01:06:17.929
If you'd like me
to take a look at it,

01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:19.731
I'm pretty handy
at fixing things.

01:06:19.733 --> 01:06:20.868
It'll take a miracle.

01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:22.803
Okay.

01:06:36.516 --> 01:06:38.282
[door closes]

01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:40.520
I don't even know where
to begin with you two.

01:06:41.688 --> 01:06:46.657
Sneaking out at night,
taking my keys,

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:48.392
breaking and entering.

01:06:48.394 --> 01:06:49.961
Dad, we're telling the truth.
I can prove it.

01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:52.233
You realize that you
could have went to jail.

01:06:55.335 --> 01:06:59.436
Go. Both of you,
to bed. Now.

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:01.505
- We'll talk about this in the morning.
- But, Mom...

01:07:01.507 --> 01:07:03.376
I said bed.

01:07:07.514 --> 01:07:08.615
[sighs]

01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:11.618
Holy moly.

01:07:14.487 --> 01:07:16.688
How am I gonna
explain this one?

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.956
I'm gonna be the first VP
that never VP'ed.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:21.227
It'll all work out, honey.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.496
I talked to Sidney.

01:07:25.632 --> 01:07:27.735
She backs up their story.

01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:32.338
What?

01:07:35.976 --> 01:07:37.211
[knocking within]

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.649
Winston.

01:08:24.323 --> 01:08:25.822
Ryan. [chuckles]

01:08:25.823 --> 01:08:27.357
What are you
doing in here?

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.794
I guess you must have heard about your
kids breaking in here last night.

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:33.397
[chuckles]
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.465
You lied.

01:08:34.466 --> 01:08:39.469
I mean, you lied about
everything, didn't you?

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.072
Do some research
to back up your play?

01:08:42.073 --> 01:08:43.542
Big fan of mine, huh?

01:08:45.045 --> 01:08:46.613
Luke Lawson.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.316
[grunts]

01:08:51.318 --> 01:08:53.750
You used me to get
to my old pal.

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:56.019
Ryan, we keep files
on all our employees.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.854
That's just
standard company policy.

01:08:57.856 --> 01:08:59.790
"Come on, Bob.
Do it for the team,"

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:02.962
just like good old Coach Dunn
used to say, huh?

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.332
What about
that knee of yours?

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:10.567
The bum one. Which one
did you say it was?

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:12.069
Is it the left
or the right?

01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:16.107
Okay, um, why don't we just sit
down and talk this through?

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.774
Because I have
the sneaking suspicion

01:09:17.777 --> 01:09:20.977
that you never even
played baseball at all.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:22.846
I mean, you certainly
never played football,

01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:25.649
because a worm like you
wouldn't have the guts.

01:09:25.652 --> 01:09:28.352
All right, you know, get out of my
office before I call the police.

01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:29.754
Why don't we
call the police?

01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:31.522
What do you suppose we
should talk to them about?

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:33.691
Should we talk to them
about the marine park

01:09:33.693 --> 01:09:36.693
or the big, beautiful,

01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:40.098
illegal chemical plant
you're building?

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.000
You know, Ryan, your, uh, signature's
on those documents, too.

01:09:43.002 --> 01:09:46.470
If I go down,
you're going down with me.

01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:50.674
And you do not want to come at me.
Fifteen years of karate.

01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:51.742
Uh-huh.

01:09:51.743 --> 01:09:52.944
You know, Winston,

01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:56.817
I was gonna take the moral
high ground with you,

01:09:57.617 --> 01:09:58.950
but, uh...

01:09:58.952 --> 01:10:01.619
[yelps, groans]

01:10:01.621 --> 01:10:03.590
Now you got a bum knee.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.360
But the worst part
about it is...

01:10:07.527 --> 01:10:08.793
I actually trusted you,

01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:11.094
took your word
over my own kids'.

01:10:11.096 --> 01:10:13.865
I'm gonna sue you
for everything you have!

01:10:13.867 --> 01:10:16.070
That wasn't even
the right knee.

01:10:19.805 --> 01:10:21.071
Morning.

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:22.440
Morning.

01:10:22.442 --> 01:10:23.708
How 'bout
some breakfast?

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.076
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:25.078 --> 01:10:27.144
Where's Dad?
Trouble today?

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:28.345
He went in early,

01:10:28.347 --> 01:10:31.749
wanted to meet Mr. Mills,
try to explain what happened.

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:33.617
Sorry about last night, Mom.

01:10:33.619 --> 01:10:36.053
You know,
it's not good, Holly.

01:10:36.055 --> 01:10:38.522
Whatever happened, your Dad's
job is important to him.

01:10:38.524 --> 01:10:40.958
All right,
we all make mistakes.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.930
I just hope
this one works out.

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:46.998
Morning, buddy.
You okay?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.433
It depends on who's
mad at me, I guess.

01:10:49.435 --> 01:10:50.768
[Kevin grunts]
[cell phone chirps]

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.036
Hey! I think it's working.

01:10:53.038 --> 01:10:56.174
- What, are you serious? Here. Let me see it.
- Yeah, so...

01:10:56.176 --> 01:10:58.976
Hey, Kev, that's Sidney's phone.
You shouldn't be snooping.

01:10:58.978 --> 01:11:01.715
Yes. It downloaded from the camera.
It's here!

01:11:02.782 --> 01:11:04.551
[sighs]

01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:10.090
[squeaking, clicking]

01:11:10.957 --> 01:11:13.026
[squeals]

01:11:18.497 --> 01:11:19.629
Sidney, we got it.

01:11:19.631 --> 01:11:21.933
[squeals, clicks]
[Holly] Hey, Bernie.

01:11:21.935 --> 01:11:23.137
What's wrong?

01:11:24.203 --> 01:11:26.637
This was delivered
to my boss this morning.

01:11:26.639 --> 01:11:27.905
You were right.

01:11:27.907 --> 01:11:30.607
Winston Mills is planning
to buy Marineland.

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:32.143
Yeah, we'll see
about that.

01:11:32.145 --> 01:11:33.647
Check this out.

01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:36.848
Where did you find it?

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.915
Linked the footage from
my camera to your phone.

01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:41.054
Mom fixed it.
And watch this.

01:11:42.721 --> 01:11:44.254
[mayor] Well, it better work.

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:46.723
We're in way too deep for
this thing to be exposed.

01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:48.192
Don't worry, Mayor.

01:11:48.194 --> 01:11:50.527
[squeals]
Within 18 months,

01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:51.862
we are gonna
be in business.

01:11:51.864 --> 01:11:53.196
If this thing all goes
as planned,

01:11:53.198 --> 01:11:54.565
it might just
catapult you

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:56.099
into a run for
the governorship.

01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:57.802
Governor Brock Winters.

01:11:57.804 --> 01:12:00.207
That does have
a nice ring to it.

01:12:02.242 --> 01:12:04.741
Got 'em, Mr. Mills...

01:12:04.743 --> 01:12:06.880
[Abby] Well, those two
should be in jail.

01:12:07.546 --> 01:12:09.982
I am so sorry.

01:12:11.951 --> 01:12:13.918
I got greedy.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.655
I was blinded.

01:12:17.756 --> 01:12:19.723
I hope you all
can forgive me.

01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:21.125
It's okay, Dad.

01:12:21.127 --> 01:12:23.093
You were just doing
what you thought was best.

01:12:23.095 --> 01:12:24.928
Yeah, that's all right.
We all make mistakes.

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.768
Mmm, thanks, bud, 'cause
I just made a big one.

01:12:29.269 --> 01:12:31.035
I could be in some
real trouble here.

01:12:31.037 --> 01:12:33.173
But we have the footage, right?
Yeah.

01:12:34.039 --> 01:12:36.007
Oh, Winston
and the mayor

01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:38.576
will have too much leverage
over the judges in court.

01:12:38.578 --> 01:12:39.977
It'll be their word
against ours.

01:12:39.979 --> 01:12:42.178
But what about
the sanctuary?

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.581
Sidney says
he's gonna buy it

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.982
and keep Bernie.
What?

01:12:45.984 --> 01:12:48.251
Yeah, they got
an "indunktion" letter.

01:12:48.253 --> 01:12:50.053
They can't release Bernie.

01:12:50.055 --> 01:12:51.688
"Indunktion"?

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.924
- You mean "injunction"?
- Yes.

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:56.162
They're gonna put an injunction
on releasing that dolphin?

01:12:57.162 --> 01:12:58.164
I don't know, Ab.

01:12:59.231 --> 01:13:02.700
[sighs]
Well... [chuckles]

01:13:02.702 --> 01:13:05.736
You're the brains of the outfit.
What do you think?

01:13:05.738 --> 01:13:09.740
Well, we may not win
in a court of law,

01:13:09.742 --> 01:13:12.643
but we have the footage,
we have the Internet,

01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:14.615
and we have one secret weapon.

01:13:15.715 --> 01:13:17.113
We got Bernie, the dolphin.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:18.782
You're right.

01:13:18.784 --> 01:13:20.086
That's genius.

01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.623
What do you say, Kev?

01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:25.125
Give me a couple hours.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:33.000
[no audible dialogue]

01:13:53.386 --> 01:13:58.225

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.796

01:14:21.346 --> 01:14:22.748
[knocking]

01:14:27.987 --> 01:14:29.152
Can I help you?

01:14:29.154 --> 01:14:30.890
Mr. Robert Ray Ryan?

01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:35.259
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Bob Ryan.

01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:37.027
Mr. Ryan,
I'm Detective Wyatt.

01:14:37.029 --> 01:14:38.599
May I have a word
with you, please?

01:14:39.097 --> 01:14:40.600
Yeah, sure.

01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:48.641
Do you have any idea
why I'm here?

01:14:50.376 --> 01:14:52.212
Uh, yeah,
pretty good idea.

01:14:53.378 --> 01:14:57.313
Are you employed by
a Mills Realty Company,

01:14:57.315 --> 01:15:00.886
by one Mr. Winston Mills?
That's right.

01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:03.055
And do you know
the name...

01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:04.921
Luke Lawson?

01:15:04.923 --> 01:15:07.894
[helicopter whirring]

01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:11.898

[helicopter whirring]

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.981
Who was that
this early?

01:15:30.983 --> 01:15:34.154
That was a detective.

01:15:35.253 --> 01:15:36.352
What'd he want?

01:15:36.354 --> 01:15:38.090
He wanted
my side of the story.

01:15:39.292 --> 01:15:42.826
[mutters] What am I gonna do?
I told him the truth.

01:15:42.828 --> 01:15:44.697
Mom, Dad, come here!
Quick! Come here!

01:15:48.967 --> 01:15:50.804
[helicopter whirring on TV]

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:55.438
[Mills]
I deny these charges.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.441
I'm gonna sue all of you!

01:15:57.443 --> 01:15:59.509
[reporter] After a viral
video was released

01:15:59.511 --> 01:16:01.344
on real-estate mogul
Winston Mills

01:16:01.346 --> 01:16:03.280
and city mayor
Brock Winters,

01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:06.250
both men have been arrested
for investigation

01:16:06.252 --> 01:16:08.753
of a proposed massive
real-estate scheme.

01:16:08.755 --> 01:16:11.789
Now, a third accomplice,
still yet to be identified,

01:16:11.791 --> 01:16:15.058
was also arrested for stealing
endangered turtle eggs.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.527
This is a huge
misunderstanding.

01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:20.397
I continue to fight.
It's an election year.

01:16:20.399 --> 01:16:22.465
Vote Brock Winters!

01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:24.968
Go online
to brockwinters.com.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.871
Yeah, yeah. "Vote Brock Winters,
the mayor of the state pen."

01:16:27.873 --> 01:16:29.440
[chuckles] We did it!

01:16:29.442 --> 01:16:30.877
[cell phone chimes]

01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:36.379
[gasps softly] We got 20,000
hits since last night.

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.350
Let's go tell Bernie the good news.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:46.893
[sighs] Luke backed me up.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.168
[waves crashing]

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:06.277
[Holly] I think
he's feeling better.

01:17:06.279 --> 01:17:08.181
His sunburn doesn't
hurt him anymore.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.513
Oh, I got some good news.

01:17:10.515 --> 01:17:12.849
Just received
authorization from NOAA.

01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:13.584
Bernie can go home.

01:17:13.586 --> 01:17:15.119
Wait. Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:17:15.121 --> 01:17:17.120
The longer he stays here,
the harder it will be

01:17:17.122 --> 01:17:19.190
to adapt back
to his natural environment.

01:17:19.192 --> 01:17:21.125
We're releasing him tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

01:17:21.127 --> 01:17:23.326
We gotta find his pod and tell
'em Bernie's coming home.

01:17:23.328 --> 01:17:24.961
[chuckles] Did you
hear that, Bernie?

01:17:24.963 --> 01:17:27.430
You can go home.

01:17:27.432 --> 01:17:31.302
[chattering, clicking]

01:17:31.304 --> 01:17:33.507

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:42.205
Where are you?
Come on. We're over here!

01:18:42.207 --> 01:18:46.009
[recording continues]

01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:47.213
[Holly]
Where are they?

01:18:49.981 --> 01:18:52.886
Come on!
Please? Come on!

01:18:53.418 --> 01:18:54.451
[sighs]

01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:56.957
Don't lose faith,
all right?

01:18:58.356 --> 01:19:00.223
We'll say
some prayers tonight.

01:19:00.225 --> 01:19:02.127
[Bernie squeaking,
chattering continues]

01:19:05.597 --> 01:19:07.196
Hi. I'm Summer Sands,

01:19:07.198 --> 01:19:10.366
and with me today
I have Kevin and Holly Ryan,

01:19:10.368 --> 01:19:12.669
our local kids
whose viral footage

01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:15.272
unveiled real-estate mogul
Winston Mills

01:19:15.274 --> 01:19:17.407
and city mayor
Brock Winters' attempt

01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:20.143
to dupe the public
into a fraudulent scheme

01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:22.012
by constructing
a highly illegal

01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:23.479
and dangerous
chemical plant

01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:26.083
under the guise
of a seaside water park.

01:19:26.085 --> 01:19:28.652
So what gave you two kids
the courage to do this?

01:19:28.654 --> 01:19:31.187
Well, Ms. Sands, it was
really our dolphin friends.

01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:34.590
They saved us, so we had
to help save them, too.

01:19:34.592 --> 01:19:36.192
If everyone helps,

01:19:36.194 --> 01:19:38.361
all the ocean animals can have
a safe and happy home.

01:19:38.363 --> 01:19:42.232
Go, Bernie! I'm launching a video
companion called The Dolphin Chronicles.

01:19:42.234 --> 01:19:44.567
Mm-hmm. It'll mainly focus on
protecting the marine life

01:19:44.569 --> 01:19:48.339
and also tell... teach people
how to respect their habitats.

01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:51.107
Wow. Well, there...
There you go.

01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:53.477
True words of wisdom
from our two young heroes.

01:19:53.479 --> 01:19:56.312
We'll be back with the actual
release as it happens.

01:19:56.314 --> 01:20:00.049
I'm Summer Sands, reporting from the
sunny beaches of St. Augustine, Florida.

01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:01.387
Back to you, Peter.

01:20:13.131 --> 01:20:16.032
[Kevin] Come on! Come on, guys!
Bernie's coming home! Come on!

01:20:16.034 --> 01:20:18.102
[bleating] Bernie's coming home!
Let's go!

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:21.071
Hey!
[clapping]

01:20:21.073 --> 01:20:23.307
[bleating]
Dad.

01:20:23.309 --> 01:20:26.175
Dad, maybe just stick to
the human talk, please.

01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:28.144
Oh. Right.

01:20:28.146 --> 01:20:30.714
Here, dolphin,
dolphin, dolphin.

01:20:30.716 --> 01:20:32.652
Come on,
Bernie's family.

01:20:33.386 --> 01:20:34.518
That's them!

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.152
Aw, come on.

01:20:36.154 --> 01:20:38.187
No, it's them.
I'm not joking. Look!

01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:39.388
Are you kidding me?
That...

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.026
There they are! Yes! It's them!
Are you kidding me, Kev?

01:20:42.028 --> 01:20:43.360
Yes!
Yes!

01:20:43.362 --> 01:20:45.062
That's them?
Yeah, that's them!

01:20:45.064 --> 01:20:46.530
I'm a... Yo!

01:20:46.532 --> 01:20:48.969
Yes.
Whoo-hoo!

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.641
[Bob] Yo!

01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:58.575
We found 'em!

01:20:58.577 --> 01:20:59.942
You found them?
[Bernie clicking]

01:20:59.944 --> 01:21:03.513
The whole pod's out here, the whole family.
Yeah. Hey, Bernie.

01:21:03.515 --> 01:21:05.417
Come on, buddy. You can do this.
Come on, bud.

01:21:06.519 --> 01:21:07.718
Come on.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.352
The whole family's
out there, man.

01:21:09.354 --> 01:21:12.057
They're waiting for you.
[Bob] Bye, Bernie!

01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:14.590
Remember to write.

01:21:14.592 --> 01:21:18.128
Holly, it's time.

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:21.768
Me and Kevin will see him every day.
We're his family, too.

We knew you could
do it, buddy!

Check this out, guys.

01:23:00.298 --> 01:23:01.831
Yeah, awesome.

All right, guys, this is

Oh, man,

Hey, my turn.

Wait. What?
[scoffs]

No...
Okay, now you act.

01:23:24.323 --> 01:23:25.688
No, I'm the director.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.590
You're the one that's always
in front of the camera.

01:23:27.592 --> 01:23:29.927

"Bernie's Journey" for me.
