00:01.293 --> 00:06.089
E3 2001, when we saw <i>Halo</i>,
my friends and I, we were like, "Ugh."

00:06.173 --> 00:09.259
It's crashing, it's buggy,
it sounds terrible.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.678
It seemed like Microsoft bit off
more than they could chew.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.848
At each build,
it didn't seem to be improving at all.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.434
Like at some point
it wasn't about making <i>Halo</i> perfect.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.269
Honestly, we were just focused on,

00:19.353 --> 00:22.606
how do we get this thing
on disk in time for launch?

00:22.814 --> 00:25.442
There was an incredible pressure on <i>Halo</i>.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.778
This is our lead title
and this is what we've got?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.322
If this thing fails,
it would all be for nothing.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.657
Xbox was finished.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.371
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.664
Xbox is going to be....

00:38.747 --> 00:40.999
- The future.
- Truly the future of video games.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.043
Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.504
Limitless, connected
digital entertainment.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.964
You guys never understood!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.466
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.843
Sniper. Nooo!

00:50.926 --> 00:52.469
It's a ticking time bomb.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.304
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.473
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.725
A bold vision for the figure of gaming.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.936
It's the Xbooooooox!

01:15.993 --> 01:18.537
Soon, you will be food.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.672
On <i>Halo</i>, we were doing the thing

01:28.755 --> 01:31.300
that people weren't quite sure
would even work on a console.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.467
A first-person shooter.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.344
And the framerate was terrible.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.138
<i>HALO</i> Come on, make my day!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.684
All of a sudden we were in a new area,
console games,

01:40.767 --> 01:42.311
and what do we know about console games?

01:42.811 --> 01:44.271
I had only heard things about,

01:44.354 --> 01:45.647
you know, "It's not very good, really."

01:45.731 --> 01:48.609
Bungie may be a,
a good studio, may be a fine studio,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.819
but the game wasn't really
being received that well.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.197
We're gonna make it, aren't we sir?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.075
With <i>Halo</i> and Xbox's fates intertwined,

01:57.326 --> 02:00.704
something drastic had to be done
to get the game right.

02:00.787 --> 02:05.209
So, in a last-ditch effort,
Ed Fries and Bungie essentially

02:05.292 --> 02:08.045
put the development team under arrest.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.426
Ed Fries had put <i>Halo</i> behind the curtain
and won't let anybody see it,

02:14.843 --> 02:16.595
won't let anybody talk to the Bungie team.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.472
He's like, "You guys seal yourself off.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
Literally and metaphorically,
and deliver a great game."

02:21.225 --> 02:25.521
Like, our doors, I don't even think Ed
could get into some of the Bungie doors.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.898
I kept saying "Hey, Ed, you know,
when can I play <i>Halo?"</i>

02:27.981 --> 02:29.024
And he goes, "Oh, not yet."

02:29.107 --> 02:30.943
I mean we only had
a couple more months before

02:31.026 --> 02:32.778
we had to get this thing into boxes.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.530
Good to see you, Master Chief.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.406
Things aren't going well.

02:37.741 --> 02:42.371
We had to stand up a complete game
that was performant on new hardware.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.290
We had to create a compelling story
with characters,

02:45.374 --> 02:48.460
we had to cut levels, take shortcuts,

02:48.544 --> 02:53.215
just a mad rush of long days,
sleeping under desks,

02:53.298 --> 02:56.426
full-on, old-school crunch
to get this game done.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.513
- That's got to hurt. There it is.
That's got to hurt. Oof!

03:00.013 --> 03:01.431
The one positive thing

03:01.515 --> 03:05.435
that comes out of crunch
is ideation and invention and polish.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.104
Ultimately that was one of the things

03:07.187 --> 03:10.566
that Bungie took very,
very seriously, was polish.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.486
For us, at Bungie,
this was a passionate effort

03:14.570 --> 03:19.199
to make the best game possible,
but when you show up as Microsoft,

03:19.908 --> 03:24.413
you are open to a whole
different level of criticism.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.915
Yeah, dude, that's cool. All right!

03:26.999 --> 03:31.587
And <i>Halo</i> had the burden
of showing up excellent in all ways.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.137
And we had no idea<i>Halo</i> was gonna be a hit.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.305
We hoped people would like it.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.682
Here we go.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.775
But the rubber hits the road
when you meet the gamer for real.

03:53.859 --> 03:58.947
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

03:59.031 --> 04:05.454
- Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!
Go faster!

04:07.831 --> 04:09.374
<i>Halo?</i>
- Fourth And Long.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.502
Anybody else, <i>Halo?</i>
- <i>Halo</i>, yeah. <i>Halo</i>.

04:12.169 --> 04:16.548
I remember very vividly
going to local launch events.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.509
Hold it up!

04:18.884 --> 04:22.387
Starting to look
at chatter online with fan sites.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.224
And then game reviews. And then comments.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.268
And realizing,
"Oh my God. People like it."

04:28.352 --> 04:30.395
How the hell are we gonna beat this game?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.274
<i>Halo</i>, which had problems
entering the fray,

04:35.067 --> 04:37.653
came out on day one and it was amazing.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.238
It was really amazing.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.657
I just felt that sense of possibility.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.992
Damn it, Jenkins! Fire your weapon!

04:44.117 --> 04:46.453
That you could go anywhere and do anything

04:46.537 --> 04:49.039
on this beautiful, lush planet

04:49.122 --> 04:51.708
filled with things
that were trying to kill you.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.460
They just did it so well.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.880
The controls felt natural.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.340
You could tell like that
it was going to be

04:58.423 --> 05:00.843
a breakthrough for first-person shooters.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.220
I didn't care
that I wasn't using a mouse,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.513
I was using a controller,

05:04.596 --> 05:07.683
I was in the <i>Halo</i> universe,
and it was fantastic.

05:09.852 --> 05:13.397
It was a bit of an epiphany,
of, oh, [BLEEP], like, you can do that?

05:13.772 --> 05:16.859
Like, you can play
this kind of game on a console?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.154
Awesome!

05:21.947 --> 05:24.825
<i>Halo</i> was a phenomenon,
that dual player mode was, wow.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.744
Landing on the beach with the Warthog
trying to protect Marines

05:27.828 --> 05:29.121
with Master Chief...

05:30.122 --> 05:31.915
it just blew me away man.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.877
Banshee on flames
comes down and lands on the ice

05:34.960 --> 05:38.797
and is skidding towards me across the ice,
and it's gonna run me over and kill me.

05:38.881 --> 05:42.593
And it skids to a stop
right in front of me, and I live.

05:42.801 --> 05:43.969
It was like I was there.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.429
It was like I had that experience.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.222
Somebody order a Warthog?

05:47.681 --> 05:51.560
With <i>Halo</i>, Microsoft had
that platform-defining title,

05:51.685 --> 05:55.063
that you had to go out and buy an Xbox
if you wanted to play,

05:55.147 --> 05:57.524
and that was something
that I always envied and admired.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.695
<i>Halo</i> formed so much of the backbone
of, I think, what, what Xbox is.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.238
Woo hoo!

06:03.322 --> 06:04.573
Xbox!

06:04.656 --> 06:06.825
Watching the feedback
we were getting on <i>Halo</i>,

06:06.950 --> 06:09.369
the stories people were telling,
it was a cultural moment.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.746
- You getting <i>Halo?</i>
- Oh yeah.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.122
Good. Just checking.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.209
Without <i>Halo</i>, you know, we're not here.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.461
<i>Halo. Combat Evolved.</i>

06:19.254 --> 06:20.923
Microsoft estimated that they have sold

06:21.006 --> 06:23.884
one million copies
of <i>Halo</i> in the US alone.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.845
Fifty percent of Xbox owners
are also <i>Halo</i> players.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.514
Xbox was the <i>Halo</i> box.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.432
That's what made it work.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.601
<i>Halo</i> broke ground in so many ways.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.522
In game control,
camera control, storytelling.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.689
Even art style.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.692
It inspired a lot of people
to tell a different kind of story.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.946
It changed the game for Xbox
but I also think it changed

06:44.029 --> 06:46.198
the way we look at first-person shooters.

06:47.449 --> 06:51.578
First-person shooters had only really
largely existed at scale on PC.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.915
And mapping those controls
to the controller, they just did it right.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.500
It just felt right.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.836
No one had done it that well before,

06:58.919 --> 07:02.172
no one had nailed it,
they just nailed the controls.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.717
So before <i>Halo</i> came out,
the conventional wisdom was

07:05.801 --> 07:08.971
if you wanted to play a shooter
you had to do it on a PC

07:09.179 --> 07:12.057
because that's where you would have
the precision with the mouse

07:12.140 --> 07:15.644
and keyboard to aim,
make the small movements

07:15.727 --> 07:18.480
to land that headshot on your enemies.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.150
What Bungie did with the help

07:22.234 --> 07:25.779
of Microsoft's playtesting
and user-research labs,

07:26.113 --> 07:31.285
is figure out how to get something
that would approximate that feeling,

07:31.493 --> 07:37.249
on a console, where all you have
is the two sticks to move and aim.

07:39.793 --> 07:45.174
They weren't the first to do a shooter on
the console but they did it best by far.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.803
And the influence of what Microsoft
and Bungie were able to achieve

07:49.887 --> 07:51.930
is still being felt in games today.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.976
Even today it's
the largest genre in console gaming.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.355
And, really because of <i>Halo</i>, Xbox became
the console for first-person shooter fans.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.401
The multiplayer was transcendent.

08:04.526 --> 08:08.280
It was just something that you didn't
experience on any other platform.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.953
Microsoft made a huge bet on broadband.

08:15.037 --> 08:20.501
Every single Xbox had an Ethernet port
in the back and it paid off in spades.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.754
You could use it for LAN parties
and to system link on a LAN.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.259
Oh my God!

08:29.343 --> 08:32.888
PC gamers understood the joy of the LAN,
the local area network.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.933
You make a network of computers
in a local area

08:36.016 --> 08:40.270
which means you have to be face-to-face
and nose-to-armpit with gamers.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.148
- I got the flag I'm out the front!
- Oh, that sucks.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.817
And it's a fun experience,
you can all be in a shared virtual world

08:45.901 --> 08:47.861
and run around and do things
that you couldn't through a modem

08:47.945 --> 08:50.405
just because you're all there,
connected, and it's higher speed.

08:50.489 --> 08:53.492
Microsoft ushered that in for consoles.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.872
Manually plugging
machines together to play games

08:58.956 --> 09:00.541
was not a new concept.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.794
But it had always required
a lot of technical know-how.

09:03.877 --> 09:08.173
Now, the communal gaming experience
wasn't just for computer geeks.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.758
It was for everyone.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.512
Right now we have this game going here
which is sixteen.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.807
Downstairs, I was just down there,
they probably by now

09:16.890 --> 09:18.725
have at least a sixteen game going there.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.603
They keep on bringing in more stuff
and it seems to be expanding.

09:21.687 --> 09:25.691
It was a communal party
multiplayer atmosphere

09:25.774 --> 09:27.401
that you could have
with a massive group of people

09:27.484 --> 09:29.528
and have multiple consoles all connected.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.950
- We'd get together at like 8
- AM

09:35.409 --> 09:39.162
and play 16-player <i>Halo</i> all the way
- until 8
- AM the next day.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.498
I remember running
an Ethernet cable up the stairs

09:41.582 --> 09:43.792
so I could have a friend
bring his over and play.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.920
I'd go to my buddy's house
and we're on two different floors,

09:47.045 --> 09:49.590
we're in four different rooms
cause screen looking's a thing.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.091
Man, the fights were legendary.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.968
"You looked at my screen."
"No I didn't." "Yes you did."

09:53.051 --> 09:54.219
Don't look at my screen.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.430
I can't! I can't see your screen!

09:56.513 --> 10:00.893
We'd make a little flyer at work
like "Halo LAN Party," this Saturday.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.021
Bring an Xbox,
bring a controller, bring a TV.

10:04.188 --> 10:09.109
That changed everything about
my social life for probably ten years.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.694
And these, by the way, weren't small TVs.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.990
These were the big cathode ray TVs that
you had to find a way to be able to use.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.034
I had a heavy-ass TV.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.410
Flat screens weren't around back then.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.287
- You got it?
Yup.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.916
So I bought a PT Cruiser just
so I could get my TV around and my Xbox.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.502
That was a fashion statement
to have a Xbox in the car

10:26.585 --> 10:28.253
back in the days, with that big screen.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.255
- Gimme a second. Gimme a second.
Your foot! Your foot!

10:30.339 --> 10:32.007
I know it's my foot... Ow!

10:32.716 --> 10:36.762
I remember playing nonstop and just
sitting there in my own puddle of sweat.

10:36.845 --> 10:41.767
The minute you stepped into a multiplayer
match on <i>Halo</i>, time just disappeared.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.810
You just got sucked in.

10:43.894 --> 10:47.189
And we would play all night long.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.943
It provided me an experience I had
never had on a console before, period.

10:52.444 --> 10:56.031
<i>Halo</i> was a runaway hit,
that had spawned its own social scene,

10:56.240 --> 11:00.494
putting Microsoft in the big leagues
with Sony and Nintendo for the first time.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.454
But the team wasn't done.

11:03.121 --> 11:08.043
They saw a way to take those multi-room
raucous LAN parties, and make them global.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.546
Sniper. Sniper! Ohhhh!

11:10.629 --> 11:13.298
The initial concept for Xbox Live

11:13.674 --> 11:16.760
was one of those magical ideas,
so it gets to go in a special folder

11:16.844 --> 11:18.971
that I call Epic Pitches.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.307
Because they're pitches that even
though they were in their infancy,

11:22.391 --> 11:26.395
they planted a seed of ideas
that turned into something

11:26.645 --> 11:29.523
that had an impact on the entire industry.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.567
Maybe an impact on global culture.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.819
We built an Ethernet port in every unit,

11:33.902 --> 11:35.487
and the idea was is now we can

11:35.571 --> 11:38.991
actually have a networked community
of gamers from living room

11:39.074 --> 11:41.451
to living room around the world
no matter what language you speak,

11:41.535 --> 11:42.828
no matter where you are in the world,

11:42.911 --> 11:45.289
and we can all be part
of one bigger community,

11:45.372 --> 11:48.709
and that vision was like awesome.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.880
Yes!

11:53.630 --> 11:56.300
There definitely was some skepticism
about the idea of playing

11:56.383 --> 11:58.218
multiplayer games over the Internet.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.805
When we were scrambling to get Xbox done,

12:01.889 --> 12:04.766
Xbox Live is like a vague fog
in everybody's head.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.686
Nobody knew how that was gonna work,
and whether it was gonna be

12:07.769 --> 12:10.189
a good ecosystem, and whether
the quality would ever be there.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.691
And it became a huge point of tension

12:12.774 --> 12:14.943
in terms of how it was designed
and how it was gonna work.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.320
But we're gonna do it.

12:19.323 --> 12:23.660
Microsoft is putting literally billions
of dollars on the line to back us.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.246
But the program was fraught with risk.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.666
It required technology
that really hadn't been built

12:29.750 --> 12:31.293
anywhere in the industry before.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.713
And those kind of tech investments
are always, always risky.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.175
With so much riding
on the success of Xbox Live,

12:38.258 --> 12:41.303
the team couldn't afford to develop it
in a corporate vacuum.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.432
If they wanted to deliver
a gaming experience unlike any other,

12:45.682 --> 12:48.977
they needed gamers to tell them
exactly what they wanted.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.813
We went out
and talked to a whole bunch of gamers

12:51.897 --> 12:53.190
around the United States.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.900
One of the things that came back was

12:54.983 --> 12:57.986
that voice communications
was going to be imperative.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.031
You know, it is a good day
to die, Cheesemaker..

13:02.491 --> 13:05.494
Nobody wanted to sit there
and text with a typewriter,

13:05.577 --> 13:06.912
just taking out their buddies.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.872
The first thing was
you had to get this starter kit,

13:08.956 --> 13:10.666
it had a headset in it, it's like...

13:10.749 --> 13:12.876
You were talking about console gaming.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.795
What are you supposed to do
with a headset?

13:14.878 --> 13:16.046
The Xbox communicator.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.715
It lets you talk to other gamers
while you're playing.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.635
This broke down the barriers
of how you could speak.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.680
You simply banged on your headset,
and you could talk to anybody

13:24.763 --> 13:26.223
in the world that was on the platform.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.643
Back to throw!
Zips the pass over the middle.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.688
Your defense is offensive.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.439
Your defense is offensive?

13:37.276 --> 13:40.404
Building that global couch
where people can talk

13:40.487 --> 13:42.364
and kind of virtually elbow each other,

13:44.867 --> 13:48.954
with four gamers on four continents
and have it all perfectly fluid

13:49.037 --> 13:52.249
through headsets just as if they were
sitting in the same room together.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.626
This was before Skype.

13:54.710 --> 13:58.422
So the notion of low-latency,
great-quality voice,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.465
we had to go build out that tech.

14:01.216 --> 14:05.304
I like this one, you get your own
digital personal ID, remembers your moves.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.763
- That's a good idea.
Yeah.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.474
We're creating this giant gaming universe

14:09.558 --> 14:11.768
for gamers to play in over generations.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.605
We knew it was important
to have this one identity,

14:14.688 --> 14:18.483
ah, that linked to you, where you could
build your legacy in gaming.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.693
Your gamertag.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.238
It's your identity on Xbox Live,
the legend you build for yourself

14:23.322 --> 14:24.990
in this brand new gaming universe.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.410
Remember, you're building all your stats
and friends in that name.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.496
Rather than have a gamertag for <i>Madden</i>

14:31.580 --> 14:33.665
and a separate gamertag
for <i>Halo</i>, it's like,

14:33.749 --> 14:35.584
you just want to be known as one thing.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.753
My gamertag is TheRealB.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.254
My gamertag is Cowboy22.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.381
My gamertag is HeroProtagonist.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.342
- It's KingDoug.
- TheSpeceman.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.845
Xbox Live wanted to bring that

14:46.929 --> 14:51.350
fundamental instant fun
into the world of online gaming.

14:51.475 --> 14:56.063
You will never be without a game
to play, anytime, day or night.

14:56.146 --> 14:58.482
It was a revolution in online gaming.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.610
The team was finally feeling confident.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.780
They had the technical knowhow
to build Xbox Live.

15:05.364 --> 15:09.201
But on the other side of that challenge,
was another, even bigger question.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.663
If they built it, would gamers pay for it?

15:13.413 --> 15:16.792
The technology was in the
box, but the commitment from a player,

15:16.875 --> 15:19.002
we just didn't know how it was gonna fly.

15:19.545 --> 15:22.631
That firstly someone's gonna pay
fifty bucks a month for broadband,

15:22.881 --> 15:25.884
but they also have to go tell
their friends that it's worth it.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.637
Ah, I've never been shy
to share my opinion,

15:29.137 --> 15:31.348
and there was one time
where I was talking to J.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.392
and we ended up arguing about it
all the way into the hallway,

15:33.475 --> 15:36.854
and it was me saying,
"This Xbox Live idea you have

15:36.937 --> 15:38.689
is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.982
Like I hate this idea.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.694
Somebody's gonna pay 50 dollars for,

15:43.777 --> 15:46.405
for multiplayer games
when they can get it for free?"

15:46.488 --> 15:48.615
And people did laugh
at that and said this,

15:48.699 --> 15:52.160
"Why would you pay for access because
you're already paying for your game?"

15:52.244 --> 15:54.955
It wasn't just me,
it was like an entire division worth

15:55.080 --> 15:57.040
of people saying "What, are you nuts?"

15:57.124 --> 15:58.166
So this experience had to be amazing.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.794
That was crazy to people.
Like, who's gonna play

16:01.461 --> 16:03.589
multiplayer if they have to pay for it.

16:05.257 --> 16:09.261
Microsoft is taking the Xbox
game system to a whole new level.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.472
- Xbox Live.
- The future of video games arrives today.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.058
Microsoft is putting the Xbox online.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.102
Today the Xbox goes live.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.479
Manning is at his home in Indianapolis,

16:19.980 --> 16:23.108
Hasselbeck at his in Seattle,
and they're about to play

16:23.192 --> 16:27.654
each other in a video game,
using the Microsoft Xbox console.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.448
Oh, sit down!

16:29.990 --> 16:33.243
Son, don't your coaches tell you
you can't take a sack in the red zone?

16:33.702 --> 16:35.078
That is quarterback 101.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.207
Last night, we had gamers
all over the country

16:38.290 --> 16:41.335
playing against celebrities here in LA
where we had our big premiere party.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.296
We're checking the perimeter.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.547
All right. So here I go.

16:45.631 --> 16:48.675
Xbox Live launched exactly one year

16:48.759 --> 16:53.096
after the original Xbox itself
launched, November 15th, 2002.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.891
The launch of Xbox Live
was almost like a second launch for Xbox.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.769
Blow up and kill everything in sight.
Is that what you're getting?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.646
That's the idea man,
it's just like doing <i>RoboCop.</i>

17:00.729 --> 17:02.648
I'm gonna open up a can of whoop-ass
and see how it tastes.

17:04.483 --> 17:08.153
The two launch titles
that I have such fond memories of,

17:08.237 --> 17:11.698
<i>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</i>,
which was a port of the PC game,

17:12.449 --> 17:17.538
and <i>MechAssault</i>, which was a third-person
action-orientated take on <i>MechWarrior.</i>

17:18.497 --> 17:21.124
Just lightbulbs went off,
just the magic was there.

17:21.542 --> 17:26.839
Live let us add the element of community
and human society to game design.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.674
It was just immediately clear to me

17:28.757 --> 17:31.635
that this was gonna be like
the thing for video games.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.390
What Live did for Xbox
was it created this community

17:36.473 --> 17:40.352
that once you got into it and
attached to it, was very hard to leave.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.896
I met so many people online playing games

17:42.980 --> 17:45.649
that I never woulda been cool with,
based off of us playing each other,

17:45.732 --> 17:48.277
me beatin' him, him beatin' me,
him havin' some great plays.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.237
And there's an extraordinary number

17:50.320 --> 17:53.156
of like 50-year-old males
that play Xbox Live together,

17:53.699 --> 17:56.994
and they will not go to another system
because their buddies aren't gonna go.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.372
So they're only gonna buy a system
to hang out with the guys so they can play

18:00.455 --> 18:01.707
while the kids are sleeping
and they're gonna play

18:01.790 --> 18:02.875
<i>Call of Duty</i> or something right?

18:02.958 --> 18:04.918
Every night me and my homies be on a party

18:05.002 --> 18:08.255
with about 15 to 20 of us,
and we be talkin'

18:08.338 --> 18:10.757
and talkin' about what happened
in the day, and we playin' the games,

18:10.841 --> 18:15.679
and it's just like a great gossip line
for some grown-ass men.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.181
What a nice play!

18:17.264 --> 18:19.224
We had forecasted how many

18:19.308 --> 18:21.143
Xbox Live subscribers
we were gonna have, you know

18:21.226 --> 18:23.770
month 1, month 2, month 6, et cetera.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.107
Hey we got 50,000, hey we got 100,000.

18:27.191 --> 18:29.985
Hey, we got a million, hey we got
two million, it just kept growing.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.361
And that happened, like,

18:32.321 --> 18:34.531
like, I wouldn't say instantly,
but pretty damn close.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.033
It happened very, very fast.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.452
Xbox Live was unprecedented.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.580
Everybody else's version
paled in comparison.

18:41.663 --> 18:45.667
What you think of gaming today,
being on a headset,

18:45.751 --> 18:50.172
talking with friends, playing games,
that just seems commonplace now

18:50.255 --> 18:54.676
because it is commonplace now,
but Xbox made that possible in a big way.

18:55.427 --> 18:59.806
Xbox Live could be considered one
of the very first social-media platforms.

19:00.140 --> 19:04.228
Before Facebook, even before Myspace,
Microsoft really did pioneer

19:04.311 --> 19:07.272
the very first interactive
dynamic social platform.

19:07.481 --> 19:11.026
Quite frankly, Microsoft proved
to the world that online multiplayer

19:11.109 --> 19:12.528
was going to be the key to the future.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.701
Gamers flocked to Xbox Live in numbers

19:19.785 --> 19:22.955
that even took optimists
within Microsoft by surprise.

19:23.038 --> 19:27.626
But while the platform was teeming
with newly devoted fans who loved sniping

19:27.709 --> 19:29.837
their college buddies
from different continents,

19:30.128 --> 19:32.256
there was one consistent complaint.

19:32.714 --> 19:36.176
What happened to the game
that put Xbox on the map?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.428
Where was <i>Halo?</i>

19:38.929 --> 19:41.431
When we started working
on the second <i>Halo</i> game,

19:41.765 --> 19:45.102
the weight of expectation
came crashing down on us.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.979
<i>Halo 2</i> had to be a blockbuster movie.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.566
And that was always a danger is,
what if we just push to do this

19:50.649 --> 19:54.069
big triple-A spectacle,
and miss the heart of what

19:54.152 --> 19:56.238
made <i>Halo</i> a success in the first place?

19:56.321 --> 19:59.783
Goddamn we have a lot of work to do,
between now and E3.

20:01.285 --> 20:05.914
Everybody on the team had a different idea
about what being more excellent would be.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.003
We loved that you could get into vehicles,
for example, but it frustrated us

20:11.086 --> 20:13.380
that you couldn't, like,
tear someone out of a vehicle

20:13.463 --> 20:15.215
and jump into their vehicle
and take it over.

20:15.299 --> 20:19.219
So boarding vehicles
became a huge design initiative.

20:19.303 --> 20:20.804
Look out!

20:21.889 --> 20:24.975
We were really good
at coming up with great ideas.

20:25.058 --> 20:29.396
We weren't quite as good
at production discipline

20:29.479 --> 20:33.150
and figuring out how to right-size
all those ideas,

20:33.233 --> 20:36.528
fit 'em into a box,
timeline, and ship on time.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.282
When I got there, they had reached

20:40.365 --> 20:42.492
a point in development
where they were basically

20:42.576 --> 20:46.496
gonna have to cut half the game,
and in some ways start from scratch

20:46.580 --> 20:48.790
on a lot of the promises
that they'd made themselves.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.795
Within a year,
it became clear it wasn't working.

20:53.879 --> 20:57.299
Just the way the game felt
Jason really wasn't happy with.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.467
He looked at the game.

20:59.051 --> 21:00.052
this.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.638
And he came to me
and said, "You know we have a problem.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.556
I'm gonna have to rework
a bunch of the work

21:04.640 --> 21:07.684
and it's effectively gonna add
another year to the schedule."

21:07.809 --> 21:09.436
Jason help!

21:09.520 --> 21:10.854
There was a lot of pressure.

21:10.938 --> 21:13.190
How can we ship a better game than <i>Halo?</i>

21:14.233 --> 21:16.860
And from Microsoft's point of view,
Xbox's point of view,

21:17.027 --> 21:19.613
how can you ship that game
as quickly as possible?

21:19.696 --> 21:23.242
This is now by far the most
valuable franchise that we have.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.911
You know this is <i>Halo</i>,
we can't screw this up.

21:28.622 --> 21:33.085
Jason saying he needs a new year, time
for me to step up and do my job as a boss.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.212
I do know that Ed went to bat for us.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.172
Ed was very much a purist.

21:37.256 --> 21:39.883
He was about creating great games
and giving the dev teams

21:39.967 --> 21:43.554
the time they need,
and that is at conflict

21:43.637 --> 21:46.014
sometimes with actually making a profit.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.850
So, to me it was a no-brainer.

21:47.933 --> 21:50.978
But ah, Robbie wanted to put it in front

21:51.061 --> 21:54.273
of the other leads on the team,
because <i>Halo</i> was so important,

21:54.356 --> 21:57.985
it's gonna affect, you know,
the Xbox Live team and what they do,

21:58.068 --> 22:02.114
it would affect the continued marketing
of the platform and things like that.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.117
Microsoft back then
was a technology company.

22:05.576 --> 22:09.037
Software, shipping on time, at quality,

22:09.121 --> 22:11.164
was a big part
of the rhythm of the business.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.043
So, we go in and we have the meeting

22:15.127 --> 22:17.754
and Robbie basically goes around the room
and takes a vote.

22:18.422 --> 22:22.843
And it went around the room and everybody
voted to keep it on the original schedule.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.847
I walked out of the room and basically
I just threatened to quit immediately.

22:27.723 --> 22:28.807
Robbie gave in.

22:28.974 --> 22:32.978
He calmed me down and he agreed
and he gave us the extra year for <i>Halo 2.</i>

22:33.729 --> 22:36.940
Ed got the Bungie team
the time they needed to finish the game.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.944
But the delayed launch
had a ripple effect throughout Microsoft.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.447
Really that Bungie meeting
was the beginning of the end for me.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.866
When I walked out of there,
it wasn't just that I was mad,

22:45.949 --> 22:49.494
it was the first time I could
imagine leaving the company.

22:49.578 --> 22:52.831
I had been there since I was in college.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.791
I had a lot of stuff going on in my life.

22:55.042 --> 22:59.379
About to turn 40.
Um, I had been at the company a long time

22:59.463 --> 23:01.965
and made plenty of money
so I didn't need to be there.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.634
Within the next six months I quit.

23:04.593 --> 23:08.972
In January 2004,
Ed Fries resigned from Microsoft,

23:09.056 --> 23:13.268
while Bungie set out to finish
what they'd started, creating a sequel

23:13.352 --> 23:16.563
to one of the most popular titles
in console history.

23:16.855 --> 23:20.943
The extra year Fries bought them
turned out to make all the difference.

23:22.861 --> 23:28.367
Not only did it elevate the game,
it built fan excitement to a whole...

23:28.450 --> 23:29.451
New...

23:29.535 --> 23:30.661
Level.

23:32.913 --> 23:38.752
The lead-up to <i>Halo 2</i>, I had never
experienced anything like that in my life.

23:39.711 --> 23:44.758
It was genuinely a pop-culture event,
and I don't say that lightly.

23:44.842 --> 23:46.510
7,000 stores are opening on midnight.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.595
They've been waiting a long time for this.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.514
They were chanting, <i>"Halo 2!</i> "

23:50.597 --> 23:51.890
<i>Halo 2!</i>

23:51.974 --> 23:53.267
<i>Halo 2!</i>

23:53.350 --> 23:56.812
It just felt like something new
was going to happen in entertainment.

23:57.062 --> 23:59.857
Because <i>Halo 2</i> is the best,<i>Halo 2</i> is everything!

24:00.941 --> 24:05.779
Xbox's <i>Halo 2</i> is expected to generate
more revenue in 24 hours

24:06.488 --> 24:10.659
than day 1 sales of any full-feature movie
in entertainment history.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.874
<i>Halo 2</i> is probably, you know,
one of the biggest, ah,

24:16.957 --> 24:20.085
phenomenons to ever hit my life,
and a lot of people's lives.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.713
It was the biggest day
in entertainment history.

24:23.046 --> 24:28.218
<i>Halo 2</i> sold 2.4 million units

24:28.719 --> 24:30.804
in 24 hours.

24:30.888 --> 24:35.309
Here was a video game, for the first time
really crushing movies.

24:35.392 --> 24:38.395
It was a coming of age story
for the video-game industry.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.689
This game is simply
the best game on the planet.

24:41.023 --> 24:46.236
I played <i>Halo 2</i> with my friends
literally every night for at least a year.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.448
That's how transformative<i>Halo 2</i> was for me,

24:49.531 --> 24:53.994
and what it did for Xbox Live,
there had been nothing like that, ever.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.747
With the innovative success of Xbox Live,

24:56.830 --> 24:59.791
and a full-blown cultural
phenomenon in <i>Halo 2</i>,

25:00.167 --> 25:03.003
it seemed like Microsoft's
bets were paying off.

25:03.629 --> 25:07.049
Xbox was even surpassing
Nintendo in US sales.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.885
On a winning streak,
the team put their eyes

25:09.968 --> 25:13.013
on an industry-changing
follow-up to the Xbox.

25:16.099 --> 25:20.187
When I arrived at Microsoft,
it was my job to think about the way

25:20.270 --> 25:24.691
that the gamer was gonna be using this,
two, three, four years after launch,

25:24.775 --> 25:26.818
and how do you continue
to deliver content.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.531
We started then to plan this multibillion

25:30.614 --> 25:34.159
dollar investment,
that became the Xbox 360.

25:36.495 --> 25:39.456
Xbox 360 is the new entertainment system

25:39.623 --> 25:42.876
that's designed around high def,
wireless, and always connected.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.253
And it doesn't stop there.

25:44.378 --> 25:45.587
It's totally personalizable

25:45.671 --> 25:48.131
so you can change the way it works,
and the way it plays,

25:48.340 --> 25:50.133
and find your friends
no matter what you're doing.

25:50.509 --> 25:54.263
When they unveiled the 360,
I saw a very powerful console

25:54.346 --> 25:59.393
with a stunning interface, with a focus
on, on being online, always connected.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.437
This was all stuff that they had
sort of experimented with,

26:02.521 --> 26:05.816
with the original Xbox and Xbox Live
but now they were building it

26:05.899 --> 26:08.443
into the core experience of the console.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.490
Xbox 360 was
five to ten times more powerful

26:13.574 --> 26:15.284
than the original Xbox.

26:15.367 --> 26:18.787
To achieve that, we had to push technology

26:18.996 --> 26:22.791
and solutions that didn't exist
in the previous generation.

26:22.875 --> 26:26.003
We had to go explore things
that had never been done.

26:26.461 --> 26:29.923
As opposed to leveraging
a lot of off-the-shelf components

26:30.007 --> 26:32.301
and existing technologies,
we were actually building,

26:32.384 --> 26:36.763
a brand-new processor
and chipset for this particular console.

26:36.847 --> 26:40.017
So we were taking a lot more
of that engineering effort on internally.

26:40.684 --> 26:44.396
At the heart of the Xbox 360
are 3 IBM CPUs.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.441
Whatever you'd heard
about the PlayStation 2,

26:47.524 --> 26:50.402
Emotion Engine, you know,
whatever big, wild dreams

26:50.485 --> 26:53.113
you had created in your head,
we needed to create

26:53.197 --> 26:56.450
a leapfrog product that said,
"Hey, this is even more powerful.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.119
This is the most powerful
console on the planet."

26:59.203 --> 27:03.081
And so, we evolved the Xbox
from a powerful console

27:03.165 --> 27:07.127
that plays all the games you love,
to a console that connects you

27:07.211 --> 27:09.671
to all your friends
and connects you to a lifestyle,

27:09.755 --> 27:11.507
this digital entertainment lifestyle.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.717
We involved movies.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.305
We got content generated
that you could access, music.

27:18.430 --> 27:24.061
The magic in Xbox 360 is, it does
so much more than the original Xbox did.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.729
Xbox 360 guide?

27:25.812 --> 27:29.399
It is your launch pad
to all of your digital entertainment.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.945
Here you can store
your pictures, videos, and music.

27:33.445 --> 27:35.656
We've also added a new concept
called achievements.

27:35.739 --> 27:37.824
Sort of a record of everything
you've accomplished

27:37.908 --> 27:40.160
across your entire library of games.

27:40.244 --> 27:45.832
With Xbox 360, we've created technology
that will enable people from every age

27:46.124 --> 27:50.087
and every corner of the planet
to gather together in new ways.

27:50.420 --> 27:54.007
A product with games at its core,
surrounded by limitless,

27:54.299 --> 27:56.760
connected digital entertainment.

28:00.639 --> 28:03.183
Everything we were trying
to do had just never been done before.

28:03.851 --> 28:08.063
We're really focusing hardcore on building

28:08.146 --> 28:10.774
an online experience
for Xbox around games.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.151
Gaming was always first.

28:13.527 --> 28:19.074
But this was no longer just the ability
for you to play a game online.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.701
This was breakthrough thinking.

28:20.784 --> 28:23.328
We built Xbox 360 with a mission.

28:23.996 --> 28:27.082
They showed it as a media hub
in your living room.

28:27.165 --> 28:29.710
You could connect other devices to it,
you could play your photos.

28:29.793 --> 28:33.338
You can do this, that, the other.
They targeted a broad range of gamers.

28:33.422 --> 28:35.549
They were building this thing
to be future-proof.

28:35.966 --> 28:40.804
Microsoft's new Xbox 360 will be
first to hit store shelves this fall.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.724
It's huge.
It's a big, big statement for us.

28:43.974 --> 28:46.185
The next generation
of consoles starts now.

28:46.268 --> 28:49.313
We wanted to try something new
with the Xbox 360 launch.

28:49.396 --> 28:52.024
- Xbox rules, man!
What are your favorite games?

28:52.107 --> 28:53.275
- Woo!
Where are you guys from?

28:53.358 --> 28:55.777
Did you drive far?
- Well, from Indianapolis, Indiana!

28:55.861 --> 28:57.446
- And Kansas City.
- Los Angeles.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.281
- Los Angeles, Hollywood.
- I came in from Minneapolis.

28:59.364 --> 29:00.365
Orlando, Florida.

29:00.449 --> 29:02.826
It's the only way
to get it on the 360, you hear me?

29:06.288 --> 29:07.623
Hey this is Xbox Live's Major Nelson,

29:07.706 --> 29:09.583
we're here at Zero Hour
in the Mojave Desert.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.251
Hey guys, you ready to go?

29:12.753 --> 29:17.299
Tonight marks the biggest gaming event
of the year, and it starts right now.

29:17.841 --> 29:22.387
Zero Hour was this in-person fan
experience in the desert in California.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.599
I was at G4 at the time,
and I remember we got wind

29:25.682 --> 29:29.186
that they were just gonna throw
an epic party for Xbox fans.

29:29.603 --> 29:31.021
It's the Xbox 360!

29:31.104 --> 29:32.189
I'm hexed!

29:32.731 --> 29:35.776
We had a hangar in the middle of nowhere.

29:35.859 --> 29:39.905
And decked it out
with hundreds of gaming stations.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.366
We are seconds away
from this hangar opening,

29:42.533 --> 29:46.620
and all of these people getting a chance
to play the Xbox 360!

29:46.703 --> 29:50.499
And as the doors start to open,
like the biggest doors you'd ever seen,

29:51.083 --> 29:55.379
you knew that you're about to run in
to what would be the future of gaming.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.548
- Are you ready?
Yeah!

29:59.007 --> 30:00.759
And we basically said,

30:00.843 --> 30:02.302
"Hey, come here and you're gonna be
the first to play games

30:02.386 --> 30:04.221
and we're gonna sell you
consoles here as well."

30:04.304 --> 30:05.597
I want Xbox!

30:05.681 --> 30:07.224
Thousands of gamers came.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.101
People that had met on Xbox Live

30:09.184 --> 30:11.395
that had never actually seen
each other in person before.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.146
People were so happy.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.648
It was a magical launch event.

30:15.065 --> 30:19.319
The Zero Hour event was
a huge success, a massive celebration.

30:19.403 --> 30:22.030
We had so much pride in this product.

30:22.114 --> 30:23.907
Was this a transcendent moment for you?

30:23.991 --> 30:25.075
Oh yes.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.618
The excitement generated in the desert

30:26.702 --> 30:28.370
spilled into the rest of the country,

30:28.453 --> 30:34.251
as the console became available
to the public on November 22nd, 2005.

30:34.334 --> 30:37.963
I waited in line in like
freezing rain for like three hours

30:38.046 --> 30:42.134
outside this Best Buy to try and get
a slip so I could get an Xbox 360.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.970
I was so stoked
when I got it, I took a selfie.

30:45.679 --> 30:50.184
They had a great launch lineup,
they had the gamer in mind first.

30:50.267 --> 30:52.144
It had the features
that I would want in a console.

30:52.561 --> 30:55.439
It had the games for casual gamers,
for hardcore gamers.

30:55.856 --> 30:59.318
The Xbox 360 Marketplace
was where you could buy digital games.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.236
Sure you had Steam
and people could do it on PC,

31:01.361 --> 31:06.033
but this was a managed, curated portfolio,
much like you know as an app store today.

31:06.116 --> 31:08.452
And we were one
of the first ones to have it.

31:10.078 --> 31:14.166
I start downloading games, and I download,<i>Joust, Robotron,</i> and <i>Defender,</i>

31:14.249 --> 31:18.462
and like all of a sudden everybody's
having fun 'cause these games are amazing,

31:18.670 --> 31:23.091
and I'm like, okay, we were sitting here,
at grandma's house, and we were bored

31:23.175 --> 31:25.761
and I just got on the Internet
and downloaded games

31:25.844 --> 31:27.429
and now we're playing
video games and having fun.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.890
Huh? Ah!

31:29.973 --> 31:32.851
This is the future,
this is the greatest thing in history,

31:32.935 --> 31:35.354
and this is what this
console transition is about.

31:38.148 --> 31:40.692
I can view my profile, so I can see
you know, what games I've got,

31:40.776 --> 31:43.070
and it's got the whole
achievements thing here as well.

31:43.153 --> 31:45.155
It was the first console
with achievements.

31:45.239 --> 31:48.450
We take that for granted now
but all the little bonus points

31:48.534 --> 31:50.160
and your gamerscore and your rating.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.120
You achieved something in the game

31:52.204 --> 31:54.873
and that something is whatever
the developer decided.

31:54.957 --> 31:58.752
Hey, did you scale this mountain, did you
open this door, did you find this thing?

31:58.836 --> 32:00.003
Somebody could play through the game but

32:00.087 --> 32:02.339
if you wanted to really complete it
you had to get every achievement.

32:03.924 --> 32:05.342
Kick some ass.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.054
I've got 148,000 gamerscore.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.430
People are like, "What is that?

32:10.514 --> 32:12.307
Why do you, why do you care?"

32:12.391 --> 32:15.602
Because it's something that reminds me
of all the time that I've had,

32:15.686 --> 32:18.146
all the games that I've played,
all the, the...

32:18.230 --> 32:20.023
I feel like I've accomplished something.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.236
They had an incredible console that

32:24.319 --> 32:28.240
was built for always online,
always ready, with a stunning interface

32:28.323 --> 32:31.285
that ran on top of everything
and ah, they came out guns blazing.

32:31.368 --> 32:33.245
Mine, finally!

32:33.328 --> 32:34.538
We had low price, with high def,

32:34.621 --> 32:37.499
with great games,
and a product that was great.

32:37.749 --> 32:40.127
And so we felt we had
a chance that generation.

32:40.836 --> 32:44.423
Yeah, we were riding high, we were
celebrating, morale was extremely high.

32:44.506 --> 32:45.716
They had arrived.

32:45.966 --> 32:48.218
They had to gain the trust of developers.

32:48.302 --> 32:51.346
They had to make a statement
with the gamers, ah, they had to show

32:51.430 --> 32:56.310
that they belonged at this party,
and the 360 was a beautiful iteration

32:56.518 --> 32:59.062
of all of the lessons that they had
learned with the original Xbox.

33:02.441 --> 33:06.445
I think 360 was finally
that moment that J.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.989
and Seamus
and everyone, you know, dreamed of.

33:10.699 --> 33:15.287
Gamers were looking to see
whether we would get it right this time.

33:15.954 --> 33:17.539
And we thought that we did.

33:17.998 --> 33:21.543
We needed to be seen
as the start of the next generation.

33:22.169 --> 33:25.881
And this all needed
to come together flawlessly.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.384
Unfortunately,
that's not quite what happened.

33:35.390 --> 33:38.143
This is called an E74 error?

33:39.228 --> 33:42.022
Contact Xbox Customer Support.

33:43.398 --> 33:46.777
It was in the forums and I started
to notice that something wasn't right.

33:48.111 --> 33:49.905
I think there's something going on here.

33:50.113 --> 33:51.740
The criticisms that we're reading about

33:51.823 --> 33:53.033
are coming from the games press

33:53.116 --> 33:55.577
who are hearing from gamers,
who are saying,

33:55.661 --> 33:56.870
"I'm having a problem with my box."

33:57.996 --> 34:00.582
You can feel the top
of the Xbox, it's pretty hot.

34:00.666 --> 34:04.169
We could hear retailers starting to say...

34:04.628 --> 34:06.004
"There's an issue here."

34:06.213 --> 34:09.675
With the 360,
Microsoft had built something

34:09.758 --> 34:13.637
amazing and special,
but this problem was something...

34:14.263 --> 34:15.430
What the [BLEEP]!

34:15.514 --> 34:18.100
...that could kill the Xbox.

34:18.809 --> 34:22.563
And all the work that they had done
to get to this point.
