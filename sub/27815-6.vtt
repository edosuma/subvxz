00:01.120 --> 00:02.200
Where is Jaclyn ?

00:03.200 --> 00:04.480
I don't know.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.840
Are you sure ?

00:07.352 --> 00:08.480
Yes.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.960
Because I think you know
exactly where she is.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.520
The cartel have lost their drugs
and their bagman.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.400
Need a hand ?

00:20.920 --> 00:22.720
You know what I'm asking
of you, right ?

00:23.302 --> 00:24.558
Yeah.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.060
- This is for Simon and Helen.
- She hated you.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.160
- No, she didn't.
- She did.

00:29.240 --> 00:29.980
You shut up.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.700
The cattle is just the beginning.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.020
If we tell them, they will leave.

00:39.100 --> 00:42.460
And if they leave,
the whole colony dies !

00:42.540 --> 00:43.900
They're coming for all of us.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.500
Who's coming for all of us ?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.260
Liverpool.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.540
I've accused the police chief
and his wife of killing someone.

00:51.620 --> 00:52.940
How long I have
until they come after me ?

00:53.020 --> 00:56.180
I can assure you even if he does
try something, he won't get past me.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.300
- You're kidding me.
- Come on then.

TIN STAR

03:55.440 --> 03:57.280
Please...

03:59.920 --> 04:03.640
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to hurt Jaclyn.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.000
It was self-defense I promise.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.720
Do you think the Chief's going
to believe

04:14.040 --> 04:17.240
that you and Angela
left me no choice ?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.320
Can I ask you a question ?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.560
What are we going to do
with those drugs ?

04:32.800 --> 04:35.800
I would have figured something out.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.400
You ever done cocaine ?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.720
I like speed myself.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.760
Then the heroin got me.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.600
Now it's just the booze.
So, I'm clean.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.200
- We moved in different circles.
- Yes, we fucking did.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.400
You're what, your PR, right ?

05:04.040 --> 05:07.000
- PR ?
- Yes.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.120
I used to murder people.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.200
If I give you the drugs
will you let me go ?

05:53.840 --> 05:57.520
I'm done. I'm fucking done.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.160
I've tried everything.
I got nothing left.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.160
Here.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.320
You caught me on a good day.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.919
Mum ? What are we doing ?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.280
- We're improvising.
- What for ?

08:45.520 --> 08:49.560
- We have to do something.
- In case the cartel comes ?

09:01.240 --> 09:04.480
- Can I ask you something ?
- Yeah, sure.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.520
Were you another Helen ?

09:07.160 --> 09:11.960
What ? No, why would you say that ?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.840
But did you know about her ?

09:20.120 --> 09:23.160
Yes.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.360
And that was very painful.
But it wasn't her fault.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.080
I'm asking

09:38.720 --> 09:42.560
if Dad got you pregnant with me
as part of a job.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.560
No.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.760
No.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.480
In here !

11:00.440 --> 11:02.320
Alright ?

11:35.080 --> 11:38.600
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

11:52.520 --> 11:56.440
Yes. I have the packet.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.360
I'll be there.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.200
You think this is over, don't you ?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.080
Really, you do. Really ?

12:29.720 --> 12:32.720
You lost their drugs.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.480
- You lost their drugs.
- Whatever.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.680
- You got one of their men killed.
- You killed him.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.320
They are not gonna let this go.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.440
You are so fucked.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.840
Look at you, you are pathetic.
Where is your fucking God now ?

12:55.440 --> 12:59.480
You're a godless fucking savage !

13:02.480 --> 13:06.120
I've had enough.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.240
Are you done ?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.360
Right.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.400
So this is what's going to happen.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.480
You're going to give them
their drugs back,

13:48.560 --> 13:51.560
then get back to your family
before they get fucking killed

13:52.040 --> 13:54.600
and the whole fucking village.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.520
Then you're going to let them know
what's coming.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.480
Right ?

14:04.240 --> 14:07.240
And I'll show you what to do.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.960
Why do you just go now ?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.640
I will fix this for you.

14:14.680 --> 14:19.160
And then I will get my family
away from here.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.600
Hi.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.480
You're making me self-conscious now.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.880
- Is this goodbye ?
- No.

15:23.960 --> 15:28.600
It's thank you. For letting me be
a part of this for a while.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.080
You'll always be welcome here.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.880
Thank you.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.840
Are you sure you want
to go back to them ?

15:40.880 --> 15:43.560
Yeah, they're family.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.640
And my dad will sort this.
I know he will.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.800
That's a great act of faith, Anna.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.280
How long have we got ?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.760
Not long.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.640
- When do you think we should tell her ?
- I don't know, Jack.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.880
Can we just all have a day together ?
Just a day...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.080
Sarah.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.200
I'm looking for a book for Thomas.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.960
I'm leaving now.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.760
The Hans Christian Anderson ?
The Nightingale.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.360
I have to make the delivery.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.680
Have you nothing to say ?

18:09.760 --> 18:12.920
What do you like me
to say to you, Johan ?

18:14.440 --> 18:19.240
One of their men is dead, don't you
understand what that means for us ?

18:20.680 --> 18:23.640
Why would I understand anything about
this world you dragged me into ?

18:23.720 --> 18:25.440
You understand what I'm about to do.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.720
You understand that.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.200
Yes.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.040
I love you.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.320
- Stay there.
- Hey.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.400
Come here to me.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.640
- What are you doing ?
- Right, just stay there.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.360
You are gorgeous. Okay.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.200
There she is.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.400
Thank you.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.000
Thanks, dad.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.400
- Who gave you that ?
- Take it.

22:04.236 --> 22:08.396
I have spoken to your cousin
Samuel in Nelson.

22:09.636 --> 22:13.716
You can stay with them for a while,
just until things settle here.

22:13.796 --> 22:17.476
- Don't send me away, Mama.
- It's for your own good.

22:18.076 --> 22:22.116
- I don't want to go.
- I understand. But it's not safe here.

22:23.356 --> 22:26.956
What about Thomas,
do I take him too ?

22:27.036 --> 22:30.876
It's too much to ask of you.
You are young.

22:36.436 --> 22:38.956
Will Papa come home ?

22:41.756 --> 22:44.156
Of course, he will.

26:58.196 --> 27:00.116
Good evening, sir.

27:00.196 --> 27:02.196
- Where would you like me to set up ?
- Anywhere.

27:02.276 --> 27:04.996
- Just here good for you ?
- That's fine. That's great.

27:13.916 --> 27:16.636
- It's a fucking tip.
- It's a lot.

27:16.716 --> 27:20.036
If anyone asks,
I'm in room three forty one.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.316
Send them up. Then call me.
Understood ? Don't forget to call.

27:24.236 --> 27:27.996
Certainly, sir.
Will there be anything else ?

27:28.076 --> 27:31.356
- No.
- Have a great day.

27:32.796 --> 27:36.356
- Remember, call me !
- Yes, sir.

28:14.156 --> 28:16.076
You alright ?

28:18.476 --> 28:22.196
Do you think of her ? My mum.

28:23.756 --> 28:26.116
Yeah, I do.

28:26.196 --> 28:29.596
- Do you still love her ?
- I love you both.

28:32.916 --> 28:35.276
You owe us, Jack.

28:37.276 --> 28:39.436
Yeah, I know.

29:29.556 --> 29:31.436
- Hello ?
- Mr. Jackson ?

29:31.516 --> 29:34.356
- Yes.
- You have a visitor.

29:36.276 --> 29:39.036
Send him up.

30:35.476 --> 30:37.636
Hello, Jack.

32:10.840 --> 32:13.080
Glad you came, Jack.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.120
It's been long overdue.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.960
I'm here because of the boy.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.560
The boy.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.520
Your son.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.760
If it's Simon you're talking about,
he's not my son, Jack.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.800
He's my nephew.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.000
Yeah. He's that too.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.440
I'm here because of him.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.160
I don't know where you've get
your information from, Jack,

33:05.240 --> 33:07.960
but you're horribly mistaken, mate.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.120
Horribly, disgustingly mistaken.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.480
Hurtfully, I might add.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.160
I deeply resent the implication
that you're making, mate...

33:18.240 --> 33:20.360
That you raped your sister.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.320
- That you had sex with your sister.
- Stop this filth now.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.520
- You had sex with your own sister.
- Liar.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.320
You. Liar.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.840
Can she hear me ?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.040
She can hear me.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.360
- Hello, Helen.
- Christ.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.680
It's me, love.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.200
Jack.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.880
I'm sitting here with Frank.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.960
Your brother. Frank.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.280
- You want to talk to her ?
- No.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.080
- Talk to her.
- No.

34:29.199 --> 34:33.639
I don't know what you're trying
to achieve here, mate. I've no idea.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.360
You talk to her.

34:42.320 --> 34:46.080
- Tell her you're sorry.
- Why don't you ?

34:49.080 --> 34:50.360
I am.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.880
- Fuck you.
- Talk to her.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.680
Fucking talk to her.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.760
Hello, sweetheart !

35:13.480 --> 35:17.560
It's Frank here, love. Frank.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.720
I don't really know what to say love.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.960
Only...

35:35.960 --> 35:38.000
I'm sorry.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.080
I'm so sorry.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.680
I know what I did, love...

35:50.120 --> 35:52.520
And I shouldn't have.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.320
I shouldn't have...

36:01.280 --> 36:05.720
Please, forgive me.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.560
Yeah, it's not enough.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.480
Up you get, Frank.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.400
- No.
- Get up, Frank.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.080
Don't be daft, don't be fucking daft.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.040
It's not over, Sarah.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.160
I don't know how to solve this
according to God's laws.

40:19.640 --> 40:22.640
We'll not survive this without a fight.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.400
If we abandon everything
we believe in,

40:28.480 --> 40:31.160
what do we have left to fight for ?

40:35.160 --> 40:37.680
Our lives.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.320
I have some money.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.040
I can go anywhere. I can be anything.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.080
- You don't look too happy about it.
- I am.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.640
- You're not.
- I am.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.640
Why you're shitting yourself.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.200
You're going to be okay.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.320
- Am I ?
- Yeah.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.360
I reckon.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.480
You too.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.280
- I wish you'd let me drive you.
- I'll be fine.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.400
Tell the Elders to call me
when you arrive ?

42:08.480 --> 42:10.640
We'll see you soon, yes.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.560
Be good, Thomas.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.600
Go home, Anna.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.960
Go home and be with your family.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.520
She gone then ?

43:43.640 --> 43:46.880
- Yes.
- Probably for the best.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.880
She'll probably go off
and win a rodeo or something.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.200
Can you even win a rodeo ?

43:55.320 --> 43:58.280
Dad, what are you doing ?
Just trying to cheer you up ?

43:58.360 --> 44:01.920
Yes. How am I doing ?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.640
- How old is she ?
- Sixteen.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.440
How old are you ?

44:07.520 --> 44:10.360
Dad. You know I'm nearly eighteen.

44:10.440 --> 44:14.320
- When's your birthday ?
- Not for another three weeks !

44:17.360 --> 44:19.240
Right.

44:20.680 --> 44:24.880
Happy Birthday to you,

44:24.960 --> 44:28.720
Happy Birthday to you...

44:28.800 --> 44:32.760
Happy Birthday, dear Anna,

44:33.080 --> 44:36.880
Happy Birthday to you !

44:46.520 --> 44:48.840
Thank you.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.240
Cheers to you, dad,
for shooting me in the chest !

44:52.960 --> 44:55.280
Cheers to you, mum, for teaching me
how to shoot back

44:55.360 --> 44:59.840
and for having as shit
a singing voice as me !

45:01.080 --> 45:05.360
And cheers to you,
our bright and brilliant girl.
