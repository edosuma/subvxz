09:39.478 --> 09:42.448
HOW DID I MISS THAT ONE?

09:42.448 --> 09:44.717
LEAD THE WAY.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.653
Jake: HOLD ON.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.488
LOOK, IF YOU JUST
LET ME EXPLAIN, I--

09:49.488 --> 09:51.490
LOOK, JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.594
OK. IF I'M SOME SORT
OF DRAGON SLAYER,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.462
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT
DRAGONS ARE REAL,
RIGHT?

09:56.462 --> 09:59.498
ABSOLUTELY,
BUT WE'RE THE GOOD
GUYS, ACTUALLY.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.467
OH, YEAH.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

10:01.467 --> 10:05.204
I'M OFFICIALLY
CREEPED OUT. BYE!

10:05.204 --> 10:06.439
LOOK. WAIT.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.140
LOOK AT THIS MARK
ON YOUR HAND.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.508
IT'S A DRAGON.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.543
HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

10:10.543 --> 10:14.480
I'LL TURN INTO
A DRAGON AND PROVE
IT TO YOU.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.649
ROSE, LOOK AT
MY EYES.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.819
SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER ME.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.822
LET ME CALL AHEAD
AND MAKE SURE
MY FAMILY'S NOT HOME.

10:22.822 --> 10:26.492
IF YOU HAVE PROOF,
YOU CAN SHOW ME THERE.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.334
WELL, THIS IS JUST
THE STRANGEST MUSEUM

10:35.334 --> 10:40.673
OF ANCIENT CHINESE
WARRIOR ARTIFACTS
AND MODERN ART.

10:40.673 --> 10:44.443
OH, LOOK.
IT'S SOME KIND OF
INTERACTIVE DISPLAY.

10:44.443 --> 10:47.580
Female voice:
SELF-DESTRUCT
SEQUENCE INITIATED.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.416
T-MINUS 10 SECONDS
UNTIL THERMAL
DETONATION.

10:50.416 --> 10:55.588
YEAH. I THINK THIS
MUSEUM MIGHT BE
CLOSING EARLY TODAY.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.656
DO WE NEED TO PAY
FOR THIS STUFF

10:56.656 --> 11:02.428
Spud: UH, YEAH.
I'M SURE THEY'LL JUST
SEND US A BILL.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.664
WHOA!

11:06.432 --> 11:09.168
Rose: SO HERE WE ARE.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.337
ROSE, I'M SO SORRY
I HAD TO SPRING

11:11.337 --> 11:12.638
ALL THIS ON YOU.

11:12.638 --> 11:14.507
IT'S JUST THAT
MY GRANDFATHER'S--

11:14.507 --> 11:16.676
JAKE, THESE ARE
MY PARENTS.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.246
I HAD TO. LISTEN,
JAKE, YOU SEEM
REALLY NICE,

11:20.246 --> 11:22.615
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE SOME POWERFUL
DELUSIONS,

11:22.615 --> 11:24.650
AND I THINK YOU NEED
HELP LETTING GO.

11:24.650 --> 11:27.353
ROSE, NO. I KNOW
IT SOUNDS UNBELIEVABLE,

11:27.353 --> 11:28.754
BUT EVERYTHING
I TOLD YOU IS TRUE.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.890
I CAN PROVE IT.
WATCH THIS.

11:30.890 --> 11:35.461
ROSE, WAIT!
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ME.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.931
YOU HAVE TO.
PLEASE!

11:44.437 --> 11:46.772
UH!

11:47.973 --> 11:50.509
DRAGON UP!

11:50.509 --> 11:52.311
NO. I'M TOO LATE.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.381
THE ECLIPSE
ALREADY STARTED.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.449
I'M GONNA GO GRAB
SOME ICE.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.317
BE BACK IN A JIFF
AND A HALF.

11:58.317 --> 12:01.787
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

12:01.787 --> 12:04.623
LONG STORY SHORT--
GRAMPS HAS BEEN CAPTURED
BY THE DARK DRAGON,

12:04.623 --> 12:06.325
WHO'S FORCING JAKE TO SLIP
A MIND-CONTROL POTION

12:06.325 --> 12:07.960
TO ALL THE WORLD'S DRAGONS
AT A SECRET MEETING TONIGHT.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.564
OH. YOU'D THINK I'D GET
USED TO THIS KIND
OF THING BY NOW.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.266
WHERE IS JAKE?
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE WITH ROSE

12:14.266 --> 12:17.703
I DON'T KNOW, BUT
I'D BETTER PRACTICE
MY FIGHT MOVES.

12:17.703 --> 12:22.508
SILLY ME. I FORGOT
THE ICE BUCKET--AAH!
OH, GOOD GOLLY.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.643
HONEY, WAIT.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.012
MY DAUGHTER. SHE'S--SHE'S
SOME KIND OF

12:27.012 --> 12:28.647
PINK FLYING REPTILE HERE.

12:28.647 --> 12:31.450
UH, IT'S A MIRAGE.
NO, WAIT.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.954
UM, YOU'RE DREAMING.
YEAH. IT'S--IT'S--

12:34.954 --> 12:39.291
OH, IT'S MY SIDE
OF THE FAMILY.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.593
WE'RE DRAGONS.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.027
I JUST NEVER KNEW
HOW TO TELL YOU, HONEY.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.029
AND SINCE THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG HERE,

12:44.029 --> 12:46.632
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES?

12:46.632 --> 12:47.933
HEE HEE. OK, LISTEN.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.569
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
SIT DOWN. YOU KNOW--

12:50.569 --> 12:51.537
UH!

12:51.537 --> 12:54.507
OR LIE DOWN.
THAT WORKS, TOO.

12:58.511 --> 13:03.582
BUT THIS IS A
LITTLE MORE THAN
I BARGAINED FOR.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.051
OK, LET ME JUST
SUM IT ALL UP
HERE.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.653
YOU'RE ALL DRAGONS--

13:07.653 --> 13:10.389
MAGICAL
FIRE-BREATHING
DRAGONS.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.658
WELL, IT SKIPPED
MY GENERATION,

13:12.658 --> 13:15.394
BUT MY FATHER,
HALEY, AND--

13:15.394 --> 13:17.696
HE'S IN SOME
SERIOUS TROUBLE,
JOHN.

13:17.696 --> 13:21.467
BEFORE NOW,
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I KNOW YOU.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.568
WELL, IF JAKE
IS IN TROUBLE,

13:22.568 --> 13:26.539
COME ON. YOU CAN
FILL ME IN ON THE WAY.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.883
THE AMERICAN DRAGON--
LATE AS USUAL, I SEE.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.919
JAKE, WHERE ARE YOUR
GRANDFATHER AND HALEY?

13:39.919 --> 13:42.388
THEY'RE GONNA MISS
THE THOUSAND-YEAR TOAST.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.590
UH, THEY'RE RIGHT
BEHIND ME.

13:44.590 --> 13:48.928
HERE. LET ME GIVE YOU
A HAND POURING THAT.

13:50.629 --> 13:51.964
Dad: OK, ONE MORE
QUESTION.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.666
ARE UNICORNS REAL?
SURE.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.633
FAIRIES?
YOU BET.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.735
GNOMES, ELVES,
MERMAIDS?

13:56.735 --> 13:58.470
YES, YES, AND YES.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.505
SANTA CLAUS?

13:59.505 --> 14:03.676
AND YOUR FOOT ON
THE PEDAL, WILL YOU?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.978
WELCOME, DRAGONS,
ONE AND ALL,

14:05.978 --> 14:08.948
TO THE THOUSAND-YEAR
GATHERING.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.783
Dark Dragon: YES.
THE BOY IS SLIPPING THEM

14:10.783 --> 14:14.053
THE MIND-CONTROL POTION
JUST AS WE COMMANDED.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.022
Grandpa: JAKE, NO. DON'T.

14:17.022 --> 14:22.461
HIS LOVE FOR HIS FAMILY
IS HIS WEAKNESS.

14:26.665 --> 14:30.669
AND NOW WE TOAST
TO ANOTHER THOUSAND YEARS

14:30.669 --> 14:32.838
OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY

14:32.838 --> 14:36.642
THROUGHOUT
THE MAGICAL WORLD.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.984
Dark Dragon: HA HA HA!

14:45.784 --> 14:48.821
GREETINGS, MY DRAGON
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.423
ALLOW ME TO PROPOSE
ANOTHER TOAST--

14:51.423 --> 14:54.426
TO DRAGONS RULING THE WORLD!

14:54.426 --> 14:57.663
HA HA HA!

14:59.632 --> 15:02.668
FOOLS! IT IS USELESS
TO FIGHT ME.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.703
THE DARK DRAGON
SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.439
YOU ARE ALL UNDER
A MIND-CONTROL SPELL

15:07.439 --> 15:08.674
THAT YOU CANNOT
RESIST.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.609
YOU CAN THANK
THE AMERICAN DRAGON

15:10.609 --> 15:13.512
FOR SLIPPING THE SURPRISE
INTO YOUR DRINKS.

15:13.512 --> 15:17.850
I HAD NO CHOICE.
HE HAS GRANDPA.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.119
UH.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.756
GO AHEAD, DOUBLE "D."
MAKE THEM DO SOMETHING.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.824
VERY WELL.
KOREAN DRAGON,

15:25.824 --> 15:27.526
I COMMAND YOU
TO DESTROY

15:27.526 --> 15:29.962

15:30.930 --> 15:34.667
OH!

15:39.605 --> 15:42.741
HMM. THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY WHAT I HAD
IN MIND.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.610
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.545
Jake: THE MEANING
IS SIMPLE, DARK DRAG.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.880
I DITCHED YOUR POTION
AND GAVE THEM

15:47.880 --> 15:50.215
A LITTLE LOCAL
SPECIALTY INSTEAD--

15:50.215 --> 15:51.917

THE CHANCE TO JOIN ME

IN RULING THE WORLD,
BUT THE AMERICAN DRAGON

16:01.160 --> 16:02.995
HAS JUST SEALED
YOUR DESTRUCTION.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.596
Jake: IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN DESTRUCTION

16:04.596 --> 16:09.568
AND JOINING YOU,
WE'LL TAKE DESTRUCTION
EVERY TIME.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.875

OWN GRANDFATHER.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.645
HA HA!

16:20.079 --> 16:22.014
SORRY, TALL, DARK,
AND UGLY...

16:22.014 --> 16:26.118
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GO THROUGH US, TOO.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.619
ALL OF US.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.520

16:28.520 --> 16:30.823
VERY WELL.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.727
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
TO JOIN ME IN VICTORY.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.762
INSTEAD YOU SHALL ALL--

16:36.762 --> 16:37.896
UH, EXCUSE ME.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.899
BUT I MOVE THAT WE SKIP

I HAVE ANOTHER
QUESTION.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.253
IT'S JUST
BOTHERING ME.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.621
WHEN THEY TURN
INTO DRAGONS,

17:02.621 --> 17:04.522
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THEIR CLOTHES?

17:04.522 --> 17:09.762

YOU HAVE NO IDEA
OF MY DARK POWERS!

BUT HOW?

21:06.865 --> 21:09.835
YOU LEFT THIS
AT MY HOUSE.

21:10.402 --> 21:14.539
LET'S JUST SAY
IT BROUGHT BACK
SOME MEMORIES.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.144
[SIGH]
WHAT A DAY.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.113
I COULD GO FOR
A LITTLE SOAK

GONNA DO?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.187
GOOD NIGHT,

21:29.187 --> 21:31.189
ONCE AGAIN, YOU HAVE
MADE ME PROUD

21:31.189 --> 21:33.492
TO CALL MYSELF
YOUR MASTER.

21:33.492 --> 21:37.095
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS
WE STILL HAVE 6 DAYS

21:37.095 --> 21:38.563

TO BE TAKING THE
NEWS PRETTY WELL.
