They are everywhere.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.897
You must always be aware of
their presence,

01:11.070 --> 01:13.140
because they are aware of you.

01:28.540 --> 01:33.409
They study your every move,
looking for what you re veal to them.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.502
In this way, you are your own worst enemy.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.842
All the times that I got to remember

02:24.470 --> 02:26.131
Keep shying away

04:43.490 --> 04:44.809
I am so sorry.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.361
We 7/ make this r/ght.

05:00.090 --> 05:01.580
- We're taking care of it.
- What?

05:01.920 --> 05:02.909
That.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.876
Went with CIR.
Wilkins's recommendation.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.079
CI R?

05:07.470 --> 05:10.382
Crisis Intervention Resources.
They handle this sort of thing.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.638
Wayne Olsen himself is coming in at 4:00
for a risk assessment brief.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.097
That's the crisis response manual.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.226
It's good. Review it before the meeting.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.640
Commission payments are taken care of...

05:19.820 --> 05:20.809
Wait. We...

05:21.610 --> 05:24.488
we hired a crisis management team?

05:24.860 --> 05:25.895
You didn't get my e-mail?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.612
Oh, I missed that.

05:34.580 --> 05:35.786
You good for this meeting?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.996
- What do you mean?
- I just mean...

05:38.750 --> 05:40.126
Are you gonna be all right in there today?

05:40.460 --> 05:41.586
Why do you ask?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.876
What happened last night
can't happen again.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.910
I mean, I feel like I'm
on my own here, Ward. I...

05:46.010 --> 05:48.217
We have real trouble, and you...

05:49.140 --> 05:50.926
I mean, I have no idea
what's going on with you.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.499
Nothing is going on with me.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.882
Well, I tried to turn a blind eye.
I've tried to ignore it.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.896
I know what's in the drawer.

06:00.150 --> 06:01.970
Ah.

06:02.940 --> 06:04.146
Listen...

06:06.200 --> 06:07.736
Sorry.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.237
I threw out my back.

06:10.530 --> 06:14.239
I took too many muscle relaxers,
and I'm a lightweight. You know that.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.405
Look.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.256
It's not a thing.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.379
Promise.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.347
You scared me, okay?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.129
I made a mistake.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.669
Won't happen again.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.431
Okay.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.436
Oh. I need you to do
something for me.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.186
- Shoot.
- Danny.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.567
This is all about him. He has got to be
at that meeting today.

06:47.530 --> 06:51.864
Okay, I got it.
I'll make sure that he's there.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.485
Thanks.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.348
Found two more warehouses
on the Lower East Side, Mr Rand.

07:13.510 --> 07:14.716
- Is that everything?
- Yes, sir.

07:14.890 --> 07:16.926
Please, it's Danny.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.470
Megan, could you give us a minute?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.146
Of course, Mr Meachum.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.066
I'm a little busy, Ward.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.219
Danny...

07:28.780 --> 07:30.771
I found the man who makes
the Hand's heroin.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.440
But they kidnapped
the guy's daughter, so...

07:32.610 --> 07:33.611
Jesus, Danny.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.862
Look, I'm thinking they use
the Rand warehouse system.

07:36.030 --> 07:38.407
- She may be in one of these...
- Stop with your crazy story.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.322
- We have a real problem.
- This is a real problem.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.958
Have you seen the video
of you apologising?

07:45.130 --> 07:46.199
Yeah, I've seen it.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.257
In the time it took me
to walk from my office,

07:48.420 --> 07:50.661
we're probably over six million views.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.959
What's your point?

07:52.220 --> 07:55.257
We laid out a path for you to follow.

07:55.430 --> 07:57.386
Simple. Why didn't you?

07:57.680 --> 07:59.591
The woman's son was dying.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.301
Hey, sad story. Not our problem.

08:03.230 --> 08:05.471
Corporate leaders
do not admit culpability.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.891
We have to take control of this. Now.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.527
Here. Review this.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.817
These guys are gonna help us.
You're gonna be there.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.150
Meeting's at 4:00.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.026
You handle it.

08:18.620 --> 08:19.780
Excuse me?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.031
There's a woman's life in danger.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.030
So I'm thinking
I may not take the meeting.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.457
I made a promise that
you're gonna be there.

08:28.630 --> 08:29.949
You're gonna be there.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.087
We better get moving, then.
What do you mean?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.671
Six warehouses.
We can see 'em all,

08:35.840 --> 08:37.216
- and be back by 4:00, easy.
- Danny, come on.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.097
- Do this tomorrow.
- This can't wait.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.341
Fine. No more bullshit.

08:43.730 --> 08:46.472
I'm going with you.
You will be back here on time.

08:46.650 --> 08:47.935
Whatever, Dad.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.140
Don't even say that.

08:57.450 --> 08:58.610
That's yours?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.109
Sure is.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.993
- You sure we're gonna be back in time?
- In this...

09:05.290 --> 09:06.416
Yeah.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.663
Monastery boy in an Aston Martin.

09:17.180 --> 09:19.887
I had the fastest donkey cart
in K'un-Lun, too.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.157
That's it. I mean,
we gotta get him to a hospital.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.367
I don't want a hospital.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.997
- Mr Radovan...
- I... I want my daughter.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.536
Danny's taking care of that.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.497
Right now, we need to take care of you.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.450
Shh.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.056
We should call an ambulance.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.557
Not sure that's the best idea.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.894
Look, if we don't do something soon,
you're gonna have a dead man on your bed.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.937
Yeah, what about his daughter?

10:15.940 --> 10:17.237
That's Danny's problem.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.779
Our problem...
is if he continues to decline,

10:20.950 --> 10:22.986
there'll be nobody for
his daughter to come back to.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.401
If I go to the hospital, I'll be arrested.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.399
And they will kill Sabina.

10:28.460 --> 10:31.452
Hey, hey, hey. You have no idea what
they're capable of.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.086
Yeah.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.337
I've got a pretty good idea.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.922
We wait for Danny.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.545
He'll bring your daughter.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.658
This is the fourth one, Danny.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.987
It's three o'clock. We gotta head back.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.400
Not until I find her.

11:06.790 --> 11:10.783
You're wasting your time.
What's worse, my time.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.838
There is no heroin, no girl, nothing.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.412
Look, you can stay in the car if you want.
I'm not stopping.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.021
I thought you were staying in the car.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.270
Thought wrong.

11:40.570 --> 11:41.776
This it?

11:42.910 --> 11:43.899
Yeah.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.046
Holy shit!

12:02.970 --> 12:04.176
Holy shit!

12:09.730 --> 12:12.096
We have to call the police.

12:12.810 --> 12:13.970
We have to call the...

12:15.150 --> 12:16.390
No, no, no, no, no.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.896
Rand can't be tied to this.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.732
Danny, we have to get out of here!

12:24.360 --> 12:26.487
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.030
I fought him.

12:32.330 --> 12:34.662
Because he didn't stop me,
they killed him.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.000
What is that?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.046
An invitation.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.171
I'm not going anywhere else.

12:49.350 --> 12:50.419
You weren't invited.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.839
It's for me only.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.986
Danny.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.609
Hey.

13:09.620 --> 13:10.655
How is he?

13:10.830 --> 13:11.865
- Not good.
- Better.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.532
His right bronchi are contracting.
He doesn't have very long.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.620
What about his daughter?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.795
It’s called
o'a jue zhan.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.808
A grand duel.
The Hand's version of a challenge.

13:30.390 --> 13:31.846
Their best fighters against me.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.880
If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.805
You've done this before?

13:37.730 --> 13:39.607
In K'un-Lun, yeah.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.146
Not against the Hand,
but in order to advance

13:42.320 --> 13:45.312
and rise through the ranks,
I challenged and was challenged in return.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.269
Many times.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.230
It was a regular part of my life.

13:52.450 --> 13:54.498
_ You're serious? This...
this IS what you're gonna do?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.576
It's the only way to get Sabina back.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.989
Yeah, not the only way.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.627
There is a little thing called
"notifying the police."

14:00.790 --> 14:03.918
Nah, it's too rislq.
We can't take that chance.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.001
The duel begins at sundown.
We haven't got much time.

14:08.550 --> 14:11.553
Too rislq. Sundown. Of course.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.591
Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.169
I'll go with you.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.897
You can't.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.567
- This is for me only.
- Danny...

14:23.730 --> 14:26.358
- I've been doing this for 15 years.
- But not against the Hand.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.736
I know. You're right.

14:30.280 --> 14:34.114
The Hand was a myth drummed into me.
I'd never met them face-to-face.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.953
So you're saying I have more experience
fighting the Hand than you do?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.537
Well, if you want to get
technical about it.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.628
I know what they are, what they can do.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.411
This is not something you just walk into.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.580
This is what I'm supposed to do.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.507
What do you mean "supposed to do"?

14:53.810 --> 14:54.959
Look”.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.387
I'm not just an ordinary fighter, okay?

15:01.690 --> 15:02.930
I'm the Iron Fist.

15:06.110 --> 15:07.429
The hell does that mean?

15:09.530 --> 15:10.770
It means I never lose.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.651
The more you talk...

15:15.410 --> 15:16.570
the weirder this gets.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.075
Danny...

15:22.540 --> 15:23.746
Look, this is right.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.239
Why?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.716
Coming back to New York...

15:30.630 --> 15:32.336
I thought things were gonna be different.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.887
It hasn't been what I thought.

15:36.810 --> 15:41.133
I have been preparing to defend K'un-Lun
my entire life against the Hand.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.351
And now I find out that they are here?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.601
This is where I'm meant to be.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.489
What the hell?

16:13.300 --> 16:14.676
Oh, come on.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.176
Come on.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.386
Come on.

16:28.730 --> 16:29.981
Megan?

16:31.820 --> 16:33.026
Megan!

16:35.030 --> 16:38.272
- Did you empty my trash can?
- Maintenance came by early today.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.827
- Why?
- I... I didn't ask.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.456
Do you... you want me to...

16:42.620 --> 16:44.281
Hey, crisis management team is here.

16:44.580 --> 16:45.626
Okay.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.241
- Did I interrupt something?
- No. No, it's fine.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.467
Danny's not in his office.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.120
- Yeah.
- You got him, right?

16:54.380 --> 16:58.339
No, I didn't get him. You know how he is.
He's caught up in something of his own.

16:58.510 --> 16:59.886
I should've, but...

17:00.640 --> 17:01.629
Right.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.220
Hey, I'm sorry.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.049
I'm tired of hearing that.

17:11.190 --> 17:13.181
Come on, now. It's not that bad.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.566
Ward, Wayne Olsen.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.446
- Nice to meet you, Ward.
- Likewise, Mr Olsen.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.249
- And will Mr Rand be joining?
- Ah, afraid not, Mr Olsen. He's...

17:22.450 --> 17:24.327
- Uh. Indisposed.
- Understood.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.917
And call me Wayne. Your father did.

17:27.670 --> 17:28.785
Learned a lot from him.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.621
He always said, "Find fruit in failure."

17:31.920 --> 17:33.911
That he did.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.469
And you have more YouTube views
than that incredible green guy,

17:37.720 --> 17:40.632
which is its own sort of success.
It's a beautiful thing.

17:41.140 --> 17:42.516
So let's build on that.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.266
The greatest thing that
ever happened to Rand

17:45.520 --> 17:47.226
was the day Danny walked back
through the door.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.139
Okay.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.429
Okay.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.109
You're scared.

18:08.790 --> 18:09.779
No.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.869
I wanna help.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.176
Let me help.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.210
Just take care of Radovan.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.966
And I'll get Sabina.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.386
I understand why you're going.
I just don't want you to.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.687
I'm not going to get hurt.
I promise.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.568
I have a vision of total victory
and nothing else.

18:39.070 --> 18:41.402
It's the reason I've gotten this far.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.577
Defeat has no place in my mind.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.989
This isn't a tournament.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.126
Or any kind of challenge you're used to.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.415
If you lose...

18:57.420 --> 18:58.409
they'll kill you.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.329
Right?

19:01.010 --> 19:02.295
That's not gonna happen.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.806
Why are you so confident?

19:07.430 --> 19:08.806
It isn't confidence.

19:10.770 --> 19:13.352
Doubt leads to death.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.039
Tell me the legend again.

19:43.970 --> 19:46.347
Why are you so interested in
hearing it?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.056
Because it gives me courage.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.936
A child...

19:56.190 --> 19:57.521
touched by fire.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.858
Delivered from heaven to be
our greatest warrior.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.111
Destined for victory.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.578
- And that's me?
- Don't you know?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.030
I've mastered everything.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.665
Not everything.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.336
What else is there?

20:21.130 --> 20:24.008
You have yet to face the most
cunning opponent of them all.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.289
The Hand.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.340
No.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.090
Who're you talking to?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.441
It's time.

21:01.340 --> 21:02.716
Sabina.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.715
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no! Oh. Shh!

21:08.890 --> 21:11.768
He's really hurting. Shh.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.727
Calm, calm, calm, clam. Breathe.

21:13.890 --> 21:17.053
I need to get that bandage down.
Can you help me?

21:18.270 --> 21:20.602
I need you to stay calm. Shh.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.738
- Hey, hey, hey. Breathe.
- Sabina!

21:24.070 --> 21:27.153
No. No. I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not.

21:27.450 --> 21:28.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.072
Just... Just stay... hold on...
holding on to him. Okay?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.615
- Just talk to him... Shh.
- About what?

21:34.080 --> 21:35.286
Anything. Keep him calm.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.543
- Sabina, do you hate me?
- I don't wanna do this.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.831
You're doing great.
He's... He's focused on you.

21:45.090 --> 21:47.297
Just keep calm.
Just... Just another minute.

21:48.590 --> 21:49.921
You're my whole life.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.266
Then why did you leave?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.175
Forgive me.

22:01.770 --> 22:02.771
Is he...

22:04.280 --> 22:05.269
No.

22:06.490 --> 22:09.232
We got to take him in.

22:12.370 --> 22:13.359
Yeah.

23:22.190 --> 23:24.567
The Iron Fist accepts the challenge
of the Grand Duel

23:24.730 --> 23:26.721
in the name of the holy city of K'un-Lun.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.772
My terms are that, upon my victory,

23:29.950 --> 23:32.862
The Hand will relinquish custody of
the young woman Sabina

23:33.570 --> 23:35.788
and depart from Rand.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.670
Welcome.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.511
My master agrees to your terms.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.761
Should you lose, but remain alive,

24:06.150 --> 24:09.688
you must remove yourself
from all of our dealings.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.355
Agreed.

25:19.850 --> 25:23.559
I'm Danny Rand,
apprentice of Lei Kung.

25:24.270 --> 25:26.727
Champion of K'un-Lun.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.009
Is this for real?

25:29.940 --> 25:32.898
You're that rich kid that
everybody thought was dead.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.737
You were on the cover of
Forbes.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.439
People.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.578
You understand this is
a fight to the death, right?

25:40.030 --> 25:41.031
Why?

25:42.080 --> 25:44.867
- You wanna reconsider?
- Not a chance.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.326
We're just curious.

25:48.830 --> 25:50.912
Because if you really are the
Iron Fist,

25:51.500 --> 25:53.877
why aren't you standing
at the gates of K'un-Lun?

25:54.590 --> 25:55.875
And who cares anyway?

25:56.840 --> 25:59.547
Because I'm going to be the one
that puts the Iron Fist

26:00.100 --> 26:01.340
into a body bag.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.636
No, I think it's going to be me.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.641
Lot of bragging for two guys tag teaming.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.687
Except that we aren't two.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.315
We are one.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.083
You fall outside, you lose.

26:33.340 --> 26:36.161
Or if you die, you also lose.

26:48.730 --> 26:50.766
The challenge has begun.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.941
_ You cannot be
In two places at once.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.877
You must be a double-edged sword.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.309
So, you know how to fight.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.941
But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.861
Because the real Iron Fist would never
leave hIS post.

27:49.210 --> 27:52.031
It would immediately make him
unworthy.

27:52.210 --> 27:54.246
Did you run away, Danny Rand?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.832
- Shut your mouth.
- A sore spot.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.082
Or did you come here
to destroy the Hand?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.466
Is that why you're here?

28:00.630 --> 28:04.088
I don't think he knows why he's here.
He's just a little boy chasing girls.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.185
The enemy will try
and divide you.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.061
You are a living weapon.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.777
Drive all other thoughts out of your mind
except this...

28:27.540 --> 28:28.780
Destroy the Hand.

29:09.450 --> 29:10.439
Yield.

29:30.430 --> 29:32.386
The first battle is won.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.376
What do we do?

30:00.710 --> 30:01.995
I need pulmonary.

30:02.170 --> 30:03.580
- Oh, of course!
- Claire?

30:04.340 --> 30:05.625
Oh, Delicia, thank God.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.829
- I need a line hop.
- Done. What's the trauma?

30:08.010 --> 30:10.922
John Doe. Collapsing lung.
I improvised a seal, but it's not holding.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.261
Okay. Call upstairs.
We're bringing in an active.

30:16.310 --> 30:19.097
Can we forego on the fingerprints and ID?

30:19.270 --> 30:22.068
You haven't changed.
I'll buy as much time as I can.

30:22.230 --> 30:23.891
Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.271
Shit.

30:29.070 --> 30:30.947
Claire. Heard you were on the floor.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.906
- You heard I was on the floor?
- Mm.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.656
- I've been here 30 seconds.
- Mm-hm.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.032
- Friend of yours?
- Something like that.

30:38.210 --> 30:39.199
Yeah?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.958
Okay, fine. Fine, um...
put him at the head of the queue.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.410
Gentlemen, get him on a gurney.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.386
Thanks, Shirley.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.299
Sure.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.515
What are you doin'?

31:06.190 --> 31:08.818
We did the right thing, right?

31:10.030 --> 31:11.566
He's gonna be okay?

31:12.240 --> 31:15.539
Yeah. Yeah, they'll take good care of him.

32:02.460 --> 32:03.495
You're a woman.

32:03.790 --> 32:06.293
I am, indeed.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.719
Does that make you... uneasy?

32:12.510 --> 32:13.545
No.

32:16.260 --> 32:19.013
It does. I sense your fear.

32:19.930 --> 32:20.976
No, you don't.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.015
I fear no one.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.180
We all fear something.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.600
There's no need to hide.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.400
I'm not hiding.

32:34.450 --> 32:35.565
Aren't you?

32:42.210 --> 32:43.325
It's not a mask.

32:44.460 --> 32:45.449
It's who I am.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.837
Mm, I don't think so.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.917
That child died long ago.

32:53.010 --> 32:56.502
I think someone new is waiting to get out.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.106
Are we going to fight or not?

33:09.190 --> 33:10.475
We don't have to fight.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.989
Why don't you... kiss me instead?

33:17.910 --> 33:19.446
If you took me for pleasure...

33:20.950 --> 33:22.497
...how would that make you feel?

33:24.120 --> 33:25.280
Terrible?

33:28.170 --> 33:29.205
Or maybe...

33:30.800 --> 33:32.620
- Good.
-Hmm.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.461
Aw, you're worried.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.210
Even about a stranger.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.596
There's no need.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.526
What is this?

33:56.700 --> 33:59.908
Singing Spider venom. Very rare.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.788
It'll help you let go.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.821
And that's what you want, isn't it?

34:05.790 --> 34:06.779
No.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.495
Oh, it is.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.079
You want to be free of...

34:14.260 --> 34:17.002
...all that is boiling
inside of you to get out.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.598
You lose control now and then, don't you?

34:20.050 --> 34:22.052
- Stop!
- Don't you want to be free of

34:22.220 --> 34:25.223
the burden of keeping all that
in its cage?

34:25.390 --> 34:27.381
You can let it out. Let it take you.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.108
You're trying to get my heart racing
to spread the poison faster.

34:41.700 --> 34:44.112
Good! This is the real you.

34:44.290 --> 34:47.032
Follow me, Danny, and I will
let you be who you want to be.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.668
This is the person they wouldn't allow in
K'un-Lun, isn't it?

34:53.840 --> 34:56.582
The one who feels everything
and can't control himself.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.677
They wanted you to push it down.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.751
But it's here at last.

35:10.440 --> 35:13.819
I hear you crying at night in your room.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.187
Weeping over your parents and their loss.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.151
That grief is a weakness.

35:20.740 --> 35:21.866
Banish it.

35:22.910 --> 35:23.899
I can't.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.376
Yes, you can.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.506
Just give in.

35:37.170 --> 35:39.968
It's the life you want,
and I can give it to you.

35:40.930 --> 35:44.297
You were looking for freedom,
and here it is.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.346
Poisoned.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.670
A gift I freely give.

35:55.110 --> 35:57.021
Reject or accept the darkness.

35:57.730 --> 36:00.483
It is your choice. Both are acceptable.

36:01.740 --> 36:02.809
But your choice...

36:03.240 --> 36:04.730
Reveals who you are.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.017
The second battle is won.

36:37.900 --> 36:38.889
Are you hurt?

36:41.950 --> 36:42.939
Barely.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.440
If you wish to withdraw...

36:49.910 --> 36:51.491
I'm not leaving without the girl.

37:03.630 --> 37:05.211
It's a well-crafted statement,

37:05.390 --> 37:07.927
and I'm sure that Danny
can deliver it with sincerity.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.557
And it's not untrue. Uh, he was speaking
from his heart...

37:10.850 --> 37:12.090
Yeah, a great quality.

37:12.270 --> 37:14.761
He's just not up to speed on
everything that we do here.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.799
We admire his character, but...

37:17.190 --> 37:19.101
He didn't have all the data.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.469
Hmm.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.186
Right, Ward?

37:24.950 --> 37:25.939
Ward?

37:30.450 --> 37:31.439
Shit.

37:33.750 --> 37:36.571
Uh. Thanks for coming.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.706
I, uh... I guess we're done here.

37:42.550 --> 37:43.665
Ward?

37:46.640 --> 37:49.598
Hey, Ward! Stop, Ward!

37:54.020 --> 37:57.729
Yes. Yes, I know that I just had a refill,

37:57.900 --> 38:00.357
but like I already explained,

38:00.520 --> 38:04.433
my housekeeper accidently threw
the bag away with the pills in it.

38:07.740 --> 38:11.528
No. I can't wait until the doctor gets in,
in the morning.

38:15.910 --> 38:18.629
Okay, thank you for being
absolutely no help.

38:59.580 --> 39:00.911
Jeez.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.675
Ow!

39:18.310 --> 39:20.801
Ah! Ah, my hand.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.971
- I hurt it.
- Looks like it.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.430
Car door. I'm such an idiot.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.932
Why don't you have a seat?
We'll be with you as soon as we can.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.526
Uh, no, that's okay. Um, just, um...

39:30.200 --> 39:33.363
maybe some, uh, Tylenol with
Codeine or Percocet, maybe...

39:33.580 --> 39:35.366
I just...
I don't think anything's broken.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.326
All right,
let's let the doctor decide that, hm?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.912
I just need something for the pain.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.071
Look, we need to be sure.
It won't be long.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.581
Nothing is broken.

39:45.420 --> 39:48.412
Look, I've had a really long day
And now this.

39:48.670 --> 39:51.833
So I just need something
for the pain, and then I'll be on my way.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.841
All right, if I can just get you
to sign in, then...

39:53.930 --> 39:54.965
What the...

39:55.140 --> 39:56.425
Look”.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.763
Look”.
What would it take?

40:00.270 --> 40:02.647
- Three or four pills, huh?
- Oh, I see.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.266
What? Do you want the whole thing?

40:04.440 --> 40:06.852
Look, you can leave right now,
or I can call security.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.310
Security? Really?

40:08.610 --> 40:09.895
- Really?
- Ward!

40:10.360 --> 40:11.520
What is going on?

40:11.740 --> 40:13.059
Is this a friend of yours?

40:13.700 --> 40:14.689
He's my brother.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.749
Well... we seem to be
haVIng a problem here.

40:20.910 --> 40:21.911
Hey...

40:24.750 --> 40:25.990
Hey.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.717
I was just feeling a little...
You know, I... I hurt my hand.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.169
Yeah.

40:37.390 --> 40:39.767
It's not like that, Joy.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.009
Let's get you out of here.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.826
What's wrong?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.786
I didn't leave here on the best of terms.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.372
Shirley is not one to give up
without a fight.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.387
Unless someone forced her to.

41:21.310 --> 41:25.929
Hey, Delicia, um... can you check and see
which OR my John Doe was checked in to?

41:26.100 --> 41:27.647
Sure.

41:28.730 --> 41:30.607
- That's strange.
- What?

41:31.320 --> 41:32.776
He never arrived at an OR.

41:34.070 --> 41:35.059
Thanks.

41:35.950 --> 41:37.440
- They have him.
- Who has him?

41:37.740 --> 41:39.025
Come on.

41:42.370 --> 41:43.610
Claire, are you sure about this?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.615
Yeah, just one more sec, okay?

41:45.870 --> 41:46.871
- There.
- Where?

41:47.040 --> 41:48.587
- There.
- What level is this?

41:48.840 --> 41:51.547
- That is sub three.
- Okay.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.666
- Why would they have a patient down there?
- Because they're leaving!

41:53.840 --> 41:55.125
Come on. To the left.

41:57.220 --> 41:59.211
I asked Michelle
to change the schedules...

42:02.060 --> 42:03.095
Stop!

42:06.190 --> 42:08.806
I'm thinking maybe
I'll let you handle this one.

42:09.110 --> 42:10.259
I got this.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.445
- You make it look easy.
- It was easy.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.240
Both ways lead out.
I'll take the stairs.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.741
Okay.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.387
Sweet Christmas.

42:47.100 --> 42:48.180
Hey.

42:49.810 --> 42:51.016
Empty.

42:51.270 --> 42:52.567
The whole thing was a decoy.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.276
They took him a different way.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.827
At the entry to every door

43:07.000 --> 43:10.128
is the opportunity
to choose a different path.

43:12.250 --> 43:16.129
If you wish to continue as you are,
do not enter.

43:17.090 --> 43:21.538
But if you choose to face
the dragon inside,

43:22.050 --> 43:24.132
know that you risk everything.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.550
Should you live...

43:27.520 --> 43:30.011
Your former self will be destroyed.

43:34.150 --> 43:36.857
If you choose to take this up,

43:37.780 --> 43:39.566
you will be forever marked...

43:41.110 --> 43:42.486
as one of us.

43:42.950 --> 43:48.616
Are you willing to kill Danny Rand
so that the Iron Fist might live?

44:26.490 --> 44:27.650
Who the hell are you?

44:36.500 --> 44:39.082
When does the real warrior
get here?

44:40.300 --> 44:42.507
These childish insults are getting tiring.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.006
It's like you all trained
on the same playground.

44:48.850 --> 44:50.727
Would you like to choose a weapon?

44:51.890 --> 44:53.300
I am the weapon.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.395
Really?

44:58.650 --> 45:00.356
Because weapons don't feel pain.

45:03.530 --> 45:04.940
They are meant for one thing...

45:07.450 --> 45:08.735
and one thing only.

45:12.540 --> 45:14.280
To be used by their master.

45:18.710 --> 45:19.995
Who is your master?

45:21.010 --> 45:22.329
I serve only myself.

45:23.010 --> 45:24.750
Prepare to disappoint your master.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.912
And who do you serve?

45:57.330 --> 45:59.036
I serve the one who called me here.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.126
Without question.

46:01.630 --> 46:02.756
Without doubt.

46:03.670 --> 46:06.503
With a desire to serve... until death.

47:09.570 --> 47:11.526
Cast away your ch/lo'ish neeo's.

47:11.830 --> 47:14.037
Bury your mother. Bury your father.

47:14.910 --> 47:16.616
You belong to me and to me alone.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.246
You must submit; can you do it?

47:21.420 --> 47:22.409
Yes!

47:22.590 --> 47:24.740
Then tell me who you are!

47:24.920 --> 47:25.909
A child...

47:26.590 --> 47:27.966
touched by fire...

47:29.260 --> 47:31.330
delivered from heaven to become
the greatest warrior,

47:31.510 --> 47:34.001
destined for victory.

47:48.990 --> 47:50.605
Guardian of the Gate...

47:51.110 --> 47:52.771
Destroyer of the Hand.

47:54.990 --> 47:55.979
Stop!

47:58.660 --> 48:01.072
Strike him down, the girl dies.

48:01.790 --> 48:04.702
Withdraw from the duel,
and she'll be spared.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.706
That's dishonourable.

48:06.960 --> 48:09.008
What do I care for honour?

48:09.170 --> 48:10.546
Your purpose.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.007
Destroy the Hand.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.012
This is my purpose.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.881
No room for doubt. Finish it.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.725
Finish it now.

48:27.030 --> 48:29.146
You belong to me...

48:30.360 --> 48:32.237
and I command you.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.200
I withdraw.

48:53.510 --> 48:58.004
I never believed I would meet
another Iron Fist in my lifetime.

49:00.310 --> 49:01.675
I had hoped.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.182
But why are you in New York?

49:05.560 --> 49:06.640
Who are you?

49:07.110 --> 49:11.809
It seems you haven't come
to destroy us, so I'm curious.

49:12.030 --> 49:13.395
Answer my question.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.560
I am Madame Gao.

49:18.200 --> 49:23.069
Do you remember the katsura tree
in the centre of K'un-Lun Square?

49:26.290 --> 49:27.700
You've been to K'un-Lun.

49:29.880 --> 49:33.543
Its shade stretches on
for miles.

49:34.090 --> 49:36.752
And when it blooms,
it smells like brown sugar.

49:38.010 --> 49:39.716
I dream of it every night.

49:40.770 --> 49:44.513
So, please, why would you
choose to leave heaven?

49:46.600 --> 49:47.897
My reasons are my own.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.357
Like the girl?

49:50.530 --> 49:54.273
I am entertained by how your mind works.

49:54.490 --> 49:57.618
Has life inside the monastery
changed so much?

49:57.780 --> 50:01.238
Because you seem so different
from those I remember.

50:03.450 --> 50:04.906
They still teach honour.

50:06.210 --> 50:08.496
- And I made a promise.
- Honour.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.955
Yes.

50:10.210 --> 50:13.794
Something I thought your father, Wendell,
could use more of.

50:16.430 --> 50:17.465
What did you say?

50:19.510 --> 50:20.499
Wait a minute.

50:20.680 --> 50:22.420
You knew my father?

50:22.600 --> 50:24.090
Tell me about my father!

50:37.110 --> 50:38.441
I could've won.

50:39.740 --> 50:40.980
And I did win.

50:41.830 --> 50:44.367
She cheated.
What was I supposed to do?

50:45.460 --> 50:46.449
What?

50:53.800 --> 50:54.949
Was I supposed to let her die?

50:56.090 --> 50:57.079
What?

50:58.380 --> 50:59.790
What are you saying?

51:04.180 --> 51:05.590
Who are you talking to?

51:06.930 --> 51:08.056
No one.
