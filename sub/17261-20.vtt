Hot in Cleveland is recorded

00:04.713 --> 00:07.215
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.759
{\an1}Hey, Nicky, can you get two
coffees for table nine?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.136
Yeah, sure.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.432
{\an3}Oh, my God.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.767
{\an3}The new waiter
just touched my butt.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.311
Did he walk by and sort of
causally brush it with his hand?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.855
Yeah!

00:21.938 --> 00:24.065
He did that to me by the bar,
twice.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.818
He's groping us and making it
look like an accident.

00:26.901 --> 00:31.072
{\an3}Well, Joy, he probably thought
he was reaching for a mop.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.453
Where's Tony?

00:36.536 --> 00:38.663
{\an3}Oh, my beautiful son is outside
on a business call.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.624
Ladies, I have a major
announcement to make.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.793
{\an3}I have just been named
artistic director

00:43.877 --> 00:45.879
of the Cleveland
Studio Theater.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.130
- Oh!
- That's fantastic.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.257
But you've never
directed before.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.594
Oh, I know,
but how hard can it be?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.429
Directing is just
telling people what to do

00:54.512 --> 00:57.140
and sleeping with actors.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.349
The only downside is,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.769
I need investors for
my first production.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.812
{\an3}In the theater,
we call them "angels."

01:02.896 --> 01:06.566
{\an3}In real life,
they call them "suckers."

01:08.234 --> 01:11.279
Ladies, I have a major
announcement to make.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.656
The app that I developed
just sold for millions.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.492
- Oh, wow.
- Millions?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.828
{\an1}Oh, my clever boy,
my angel...

01:18.912 --> 01:20.997
{\an1}My angel.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.624
{\an1}Well, you'll be looking
for something

01:22.707 --> 01:23.958
to invest that money in.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.960
{\an3}Yeah, I was thinking
maybe a charity.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.212
{\an1}Charity?

01:27.295 --> 01:29.047
{\an1}Well, you can't make
any money on that.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.173
Now, theater,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.133
that's a sound investment.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.178
{\an1}And as luck would have it,
I am the new artistic director

01:35.261 --> 01:37.055
{\an1}for the Cleveland
Studio Theater.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.723
Oh, I would love to invest.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.851
Oh, that's fantastic.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.687
I just have one
tiny condition.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.439
{\an3}I would like a part
in the play.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.191
{\an1}Oh, have you ever
acted before?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.026
{\an3}No, but how hard
can it be?

01:50.109 --> 01:51.903
Acting is just pretending
to listen to your director

01:51.986 --> 01:54.364
{\an3}and sleeping with
the other actors, right?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.783
Well, our next play is
<i>Summer of the Locust</i>

01:56.866 --> 01:59.828
{\an1}based on a Willa Cather story
about a young farm boy

01:59.911 --> 02:02.038
{\an1}who is visited by the ghost
of his grandmother.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.832
Oh, there's an old lady part?

02:03.915 --> 02:04.874
{\an1}Yeah.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.627
Did you hear that, Joy?

02:11.339 --> 02:12.882
Well, we should celebrate.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.385
Hey, Nicky, can you get us
a bottle of champagne?

02:15.468 --> 02:16.678
{\an3}Oh, yeah, of course.
Coming right up.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.096
Thanks.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.225
He did it again.
Okay, that's it. He's got to go.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.227
Wait, you can't just accuse
someone of groping

02:24.310 --> 02:25.687
without proof.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.188
We need to go through
the security cameras

02:27.272 --> 02:29.357
and see if we have footage
of him doing it.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.944
Just don't look
at last Tuesday night.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.530
{\an3}But last Tuesday night
you were here with a date.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.407
You said you'd lock up.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.535
Wasn't that the night
we ran out of whipped cream?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.748
And sprinkles.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.224
{\an8}That was a great audition.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.101
{\an8}Elka, you nailed it.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.770
{\an7}I don't think we need to look
any further for the grandmother.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.440
{\an8}Oh, I think you do.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.776
{\an9}Grandma?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.070
{\an7}Mom,
what are you doing here?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.197
{\an8}Well, I heard about
the open auditions,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
{\an8}and I thought I should come down
and try out

03:20.366 --> 03:24.329
{\an8}because otherwise you might be
stuck with some local nobody.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.750
{\an8}Hello, Elka.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.169
{\an8}Hello, Penny.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.962
{\an7}Thank you so much
for warming them up.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.299
{\an7}Now it's time for
a professional actress.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.803
{\an7}You did a TV show
with puppets.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.140
{\an9}I'll have you know I can
express more with one hand

03:44.223 --> 03:47.602
{\an9}than most people can
with their entire bodies.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.189
{\an7}I can express how I feel
about you with one finger.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.819
{\an8}Elka was great.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.280
{\an9}Maybe she could be
Grandma's understudy.

03:59.364 --> 04:03.326
{\an7}So if something terrible
happened to Penny,

04:03.409 --> 04:06.496
{\an8}I'd step in?

04:06.579 --> 04:10.667
{\an9}Back off, blondie.
I've never missed a performance.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.962
{\an1}I bet your audiences
wished you had.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.220
{\an1}The security camera
doesn't lie.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.972
{\an1}Nicky groped me
by that table

04:24.055 --> 04:26.015
and you by the cash register.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.642
{\an3}No, don't zoom in.
Don't zoom in.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.310
I hate my butt.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.353
It's everywhere.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.522
He couldn't not grope it.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.982
Oh, shut up.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.817
You have an amazing butt.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.527
{\an1}It's so in fashion
right now.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.196
It's all about that bass.

04:40.279 --> 04:44.534
{\an1}Unlike my pancake ass.
I'm all treble.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.370
{\an3}Victoria,

04:47.453 --> 04:48.705
{\an1}what do you think
of our butts?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.498
{\an1}Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to get to rehearsal.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.459
{\an1}I don't have time to make up
an honest answer.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.422
Where the hell is my mother?

04:57.505 --> 04:59.173
Elka, would you read in
for her?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.508
(Elka)
I'd be happy to.

05:00.591 --> 05:04.846
It'll be nice to hear
how it should be read.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.597
Beat it, short stuff.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.890
Amateur hour is over.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.559
I'm terribly sorry I'm late,

05:09.642 --> 05:13.354
{\an3}but the city is tearing up
my street suddenly.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.273
Oh, I'm the mayor.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.859
{\an1}I'll find out
who ordered that.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.862
{\an3}I called.
They said it was you.

05:20.945 --> 05:25.742
{\an1}Well, that saves us
some time.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.244
Okay, everybody, we are going
to start with the scene

05:28.327 --> 05:30.246
where Phillip,
alone and desperate,

05:30.329 --> 05:31.956
sees a vision
of his beloved grandmother

05:32.040 --> 05:33.708
who died five years earlier.

05:33.791 --> 05:37.211
Now, it's a very pivotal
and poignant moment in the play.

05:39.338 --> 05:43.092
Phillip,
my darling, darling Phillip.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.763
Grandma,
is that really you?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.931
I can't believe it's you.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.601
I've missed you so much.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.104
{\an3}Oh, my God.
He's terrible.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.735
He's the worst actor
in the Chase family.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
And that's saying something.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.786
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.954
Stupid exercise.
Everything hurts.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.748
It makes me long for the days

06:13.831 --> 06:16.084
when women kept their rear ends
tucked away.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.794
We should go back
to hoop skirts.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.464
No one knew what the hell
was going on under there.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.007
Sure, half of them
died in childbirth,

06:23.091 --> 06:24.967
but at least they didn't
have to do squats.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.136
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.265
{\an1}You know, maybe we're
approaching this the wrong way.

06:31.349 --> 06:35.603
{\an1}Maybe we need to think
outside the butt.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.480
{\an1}It's not that our bottoms
look bad;

06:37.563 --> 06:39.774
{\an1}it's the way the cameras
make them look.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.109
You're right.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.486
We just need to adjust
the camera angles

06:43.569 --> 06:45.321
to make our butts
look better.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.448
Yes, and softer focus.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.325
{\an1}A little Vaseline
on the lens

06:49.408 --> 06:51.369
wouldn't kill anyone.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.954
{\an1}(Joy)
Hello, ladies.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.205
{\an1}Hey, how's <i> Summer of</i>
<i>the Locust</i> going?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.623
How's Tony?

06:55.706 --> 06:56.207
{\an3}(Victoria)
Well, um,

06:56.290 --> 06:58.209
he's a-a little raw,

06:58.292 --> 07:00.962
a little green,
a little untrained.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.714
He stinks on ice.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.015
Did you tell him?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.142
Oh, I couldn't.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.351
He'd hate me.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.019
So I thought of a better plan.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.187
{\an3}You do it.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.689
I can't do it.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.024
{\an1}It would break his untalented
little heart.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.068
{\an3}Well, you never had a problem
pointing out my faults

07:24.152 --> 07:25.653
when I was a kid.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.906
{\an1}That's different.
He's likeable.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.324
What, and I'm not?

07:30.408 --> 07:32.535
See?
We agree.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.871
{\an1}You know, parents
are supposed to support

07:34.954 --> 07:36.998
and protect their children.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.918
{\an3}Victoria, I have protected you
hundreds of times.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.504
Yeah.
Name one.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.755
{\an1}All right.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.386
{\an1}I never told you this, but your
father got a woman pregnant,

07:50.469 --> 07:53.764
and you have a secret sister.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.349
{\an3}What?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.018
{\an3}W-who is she?
What's her name?

07:57.101 --> 07:58.519
I don't know.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.188
{\an1}Susan someth--
something Italian.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.566
{\an1}I don't know, but we'll talk
about that tomorrow.

08:03.649 --> 08:07.570
{\an1}The important thing is,
what are we gonna do about Tony?

08:07.653 --> 08:09.614
{\an1}You know, maybe we could
tell him he's terrible

08:09.697 --> 08:12.241
by putting a message
in a fortune cookie.

08:12.325 --> 08:16.078
{\an3}You know, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.248
You know, I got one once saying
that dancing was not my forte.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.751
{\an1}Did you?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.758
That was you?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.593
Well, it worked.

Somebody robbed the bar.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.069
So there's no way
to identify the thief?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.696
I mean, we're out
thousands of dollars.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.698
{\an3}Sorry, ladies,
the footage is useless.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.327

to disguise his identity.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.870

are for security,

{\an3}not for making
your ass look great.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.262
{\an1}One day, science will invent
a camera that does both.

what we should have done

about the robbery.

Okay, I am so sorry,
but I can explain.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.086
I didn't know
I was touching you.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.421
I was in a really bad
car accident with my sister

11:12.505 --> 11:13.756
when I was a teenager.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.132
I severed all the nerves
in my hand.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.884
{\an1}Really?

11:16.967 --> 11:19.720
{\an1}So when you put your hand
on me like this,

11:19.804 --> 11:21.639
you can't feel anything at all?

11:21.722 --> 11:24.058
It's the other hand.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.105
{\an3}Oh, so you were just
accidently brushing us.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.316
{\an3}Oh, my God, you have no idea
what fools we've been.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.944
We got so obsessed about
the way our butts looked

11:35.027 --> 11:37.071
{\an1}in the security footage
that we adjusted

11:37.154 --> 11:39.323
{\an1}the camera angles
and put Vaseline on the lens.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.575
{\an3}Which is why we can't identify
the thief who robbed us.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.785
We're so stupid.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.162

You were groping us.

I'm sorry.

out in the open,

12:21.740 --> 12:24.034

I can't work here anymore.

it's for the best.

you to be tempted.

and wanting us so much.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.529
He's the thief
and the groper.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.073

greased out the bloody cameras.
