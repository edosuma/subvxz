19:14.100 --> 19:16.867
I GUESS I DIDN'T
PREPARE YOU AS WELL
AS I SHOULD.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.500

WITH THE COURSES

19:26.300 --> 19:28.400
THAT I'M TAKING

WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU

19:30.900 --> 19:34.300
WAS MOSTLY ABOUT LIFE
AND HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS

19:34.300 --> 19:37.200
AND HOW TO HELP
AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.300
THAT'S
WHAT YOU TAUGHT
ALL OF US.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.233
