WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:12.195
Mrs Tortelli?

00:12.455 --> 00:14.889
Oh, you must be Vito Ragonzoni.

00:15.201 --> 00:16.520
That's right.

00:16.741 --> 00:18.971
The young man who wants
to take out my little Anne Marie.

00:19.279 --> 00:21.713
- Yes, ma'am.
- Soda, Sam.

00:21.983 --> 00:24.451
Thanks for coming by, Vito.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.034
Anne Marie told me that you wanted
to take her to the movies,

00:28.308 --> 00:31.345
and I just wanted to meet you, get to
know you a little better, you know.

00:31.678 --> 00:33.077
Okay.

00:33.883 --> 00:37.114
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.694
Well...

00:40.124 --> 00:42.684
You certainly are a fine-looking
young gentleman.

00:42.954 --> 00:44.706
- No doubt about that.
- Thank you, ma'am.

00:44.993 --> 00:46.631
What movie you taking
Anne Marie to see?

00:46.907 --> 00:48.659
101 Dalmatians.

00:48.945 --> 00:51.857
- Oh, that's a Walt Disney, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

00:52.149 --> 00:54.583
Oh, one of my favourites, as I recall.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.414
It is not only entertaining--

00:59.639 --> 01:01.914
Turn to the left, please.

01:04.049 --> 01:07.121
--it has a nice message.
Now to the right.

01:08.252 --> 01:09.480
Thank you.

01:09.708 --> 01:13.462
Ms Tortelli, I'm getting the feeling
that you don't trust me too much.

01:14.618 --> 01:18.691
Oh, gee, Vito, I'm sorry. I guess
I'm being a little overprotective.

01:19.028 --> 01:21.383
You know, it's my little baby's
first date.

01:21.899 --> 01:25.608
But now that I see you, I see you're
a fine upstanding gentleman,

01:25.935 --> 01:28.130
so here, tell you what. Go on,
get out of here.

01:28.390 --> 01:30.062
Have some popcorn on me.
Have a good time.

01:30.304 --> 01:32.340
Thanks, Mrs Tortelli.

01:37.045 --> 01:39.161
Sam...

01:42.620 --> 01:46.135
...keep it in a safe place till the boys
from the lab get here.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.500 --> 03:02.138
A hearty heigh-ho, everyone.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.294
Hey, Frasier.

03:04.544 --> 03:06.978
- What's with the bird there?
- Oh, do you like it?

03:07.255 --> 03:09.052
I was doing some spring-cleaning
the other day,

03:09.297 --> 03:12.050
and I came across old Plato here.
He was my father's pet.

03:12.340 --> 03:15.457
Couldn't bear to part with him, not
even in death, so he had him stuffed.

03:15.758 --> 03:18.795
He's really got a lot of
sentimental value for me.

03:19.094 --> 03:21.210
He's an excellent example
of taxidermy.

03:21.470 --> 03:24.428
Quite valuable, I'm sure.
And I'd like you to have him.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.493
Frasier, I don't think so.

03:29.766 --> 03:31.597
- Well, then toss it.
- All right.

03:36.354 --> 03:38.788
Oh, and, Diane,

03:39.063 --> 03:41.293
I came across these slides
of our trip to Europe.

03:41.564 --> 03:43.634
I didn't want to throw them away
and didn't want them.

03:43.899 --> 03:46.208
I thought perhaps you'd like them.

03:46.484 --> 03:50.238
Oh, that's very thoughtful, Frasier.
I'd love to look at them.

03:50.612 --> 03:55.049
Well, hey, I got a projector
and a screen in the backroom there.

03:55.406 --> 03:57.283
You said that projector was broken

03:57.532 --> 04:00.330
when I wanted to show my slides
of Colombian art.

04:00.658 --> 04:04.537
Well, yes, it is broken when you wanna
show your slides of Colombian art.

04:07.787 --> 04:10.347
I don't see any reason why we should
show these slides here.

04:10.622 --> 04:13.341
Well, why not? I think those slides
might benefit everyone.

04:13.623 --> 04:16.012
It's a chance to see Europe's
cultural and artistic highlights

04:16.291 --> 04:18.442
with an informed commentary
by people who've been there.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.349
Anyone who wants to see slides
of Diane's and my trip to Europe,

04:21.627 --> 04:23.299
raise your hands.

04:24.671 --> 04:27.504
You could make disgusting noises
and shadow animals.

04:29.048 --> 04:30.959
Fine. I'll go set it up.

04:32.718 --> 04:34.470
- Say, Cliff.
- Yeah?

04:34.718 --> 04:37.437
Slides of the European trip, poolroom,
five minutes. Be there.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.551
Hey. Hey, yeah, great.
Wouldn't miss it.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.160
There's a major yawn.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.037
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

04:48.308 --> 04:50.617
- Norman.
- Hey, what's happening, Norm?

04:50.936 --> 04:52.688
You know, it's a dog-eat-dog world,
Sammy,

04:52.936 --> 04:54.927
and I'm wearing Milk-Bone underwear.

05:00.524 --> 05:02.276
Yeah.

05:04.609 --> 05:07.362
Vera has been phoning
every 15 minutes here.

05:08.278 --> 05:09.347
So, what's this for?

05:09.779 --> 05:12.009
Well, I told her you'd call
the second you got in.

05:12.322 --> 05:14.153
- Well, you lied.
- All right.

05:14.449 --> 05:16.724
Norman, maybe it's an emergency.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.625
No, I know why she's calling.

05:18.867 --> 05:21.097
You know the account-manager job
I'm up for?

05:21.369 --> 05:23.166
Well, it's between me
and this one other guy,

05:23.412 --> 05:25.403
and today's the day they're
making their decision.

05:25.663 --> 05:27.301
Pins and needles time, huh?

05:27.538 --> 05:29.654
Yeah. Vera's really a mess,
you know.

05:29.956 --> 05:33.266
Except she's always had kind of a low
threshold for excitement, you know.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.431
Yeah. You wouldn't believe
the tizzy she went into

05:36.710 --> 05:39.827
the day she cracked open
a double-yolked egg.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.638
I made the mistake of telling Vera
that if I get the promotion,

05:42.922 --> 05:44.514
we could buy a new house.
You know, so...

05:44.756 --> 05:47.589
It's always been a dream of hers
to have house with a bathroom so big,

05:47.883 --> 05:50.955
if you fall down,
you won't hit your head on anything.

05:51.302 --> 05:52.781
Well, now, that's smart. That's smart.

05:53.011 --> 05:55.650
Because, little-known fact,
42 percent of all deaths in America

05:55.929 --> 05:57.647
are caused by accidents
in the home.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.000
So were you.

06:02.391 --> 06:05.428
Anyway, these guys, they're really
giving us the full treatment.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.406
- What?
- Yesterday, the executive wives

06:08.686 --> 06:10.961
invited Vera to a luncheon
at a fancy French restaurant.

06:11.229 --> 06:13.379
- Hey, hey.
- Experience really changed her.

06:13.647 --> 06:15.956
She now refers to the Velveeta
as fromage, thank you.

06:18.191 --> 06:20.625
Well, you must be getting pretty
excited about this yourself.

06:20.942 --> 06:22.057
- Yeah.
- Not really.

06:22.277 --> 06:25.587
- Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
- All right, all right, I'm psyched.

06:25.904 --> 06:27.974
All right.

06:28.696 --> 06:29.811
Norman.

06:30.072 --> 06:34.065
If diligence, dedication and
the old-fashioned puritan work ethic

06:34.409 --> 06:36.718
have anything to do with it, I'm sure...

06:38.619 --> 06:40.371
Good luck, Norman.

06:42.997 --> 06:44.874
Well, it's time I stopped avoiding
the success

06:45.122 --> 06:47.078
that's been nipping at my heels
all these years.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.410
- My whole life stands before me.
- Right.

06:49.666 --> 06:51.816
I'm poised here on the brink
of destiny, guys.

06:52.085 --> 06:54.076
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look out, world, get off my runway.

06:54.335 --> 06:56.087
Ho! Look out!

06:56.379 --> 06:58.097
Hey, is everybody ready
for the slide show?

06:58.379 --> 07:01.132
Yeah, what the hell.
I got nothing better to do.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.314
All right, everybody. Filter on in here.
There's plenty of seats for everybody.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.969
Yup, come along, now. Come along.

07:11.262 --> 07:14.459
Now, if everybody's passports
are in order,

07:14.763 --> 07:18.802
we begin our sojourn
in merry old England.

07:20.850 --> 07:23.080
Yes. Here's Diane
at the Tower of London.

07:23.393 --> 07:24.712
Where's the tower?

07:25.478 --> 07:27.992
It's right there.
She's standing in front of it.

07:29.522 --> 07:31.274
Yeah.

07:31.522 --> 07:33.831
And here she is at
the changing of the guard.

07:34.108 --> 07:37.498
- Where are the guards?
- Well, if you look very closely,

07:37.817 --> 07:40.536
you can see them in the reflection
of her sunglasses.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.245
Which hide her eyes.
Which hide her emotions.

07:50.158 --> 07:52.388
And here she is in front of Big Ben.

07:52.658 --> 07:54.455
That wall looks just like
the other wall.

07:54.744 --> 08:00.296
But imagine that at the top of this wall
there's a clock.

08:01.288 --> 08:03.722
Do you actually ever take pictures
of things where you could

08:03.999 --> 08:06.308
see the things themselves?

08:07.417 --> 08:10.295
- Well, I'm sure I must have.
- Well...

08:16.589 --> 08:18.147
Scenery at last.

08:18.423 --> 08:21.654
Now, this is Diane boating
on the Seine.

08:22.009 --> 08:23.681
- Oh, yeah.
- You know,

08:23.926 --> 08:26.759
I think that was my last carefree day
on the Continent.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.717
But I digress.

08:30.805 --> 08:34.683
Yeah. Here she is pretending to enjoy
herself in front of Notre Dame.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.385
I was enjoying myself.

08:38.642 --> 08:41.110
Of course you were.
I didn't mean to imply anything else.

08:42.562 --> 08:44.632
And on to sunny ltaly.

08:44.937 --> 08:46.609
Boy, she doesn't look happy there,
does she?

08:46.855 --> 08:49.210
- No.
- How could she?

08:49.482 --> 08:52.235
She was much too preoccupied
with thoughts of desertion.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.368
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry. Ignore that.

08:56.694 --> 09:00.130
Ah, yes, beautiful Florence.

09:00.488 --> 09:03.321
She looks just like Miss Chambers.

09:06.075 --> 09:08.714
It is Diane, Woody.

09:08.992 --> 09:11.062
I think this is the night
I proposed to her.

09:12.036 --> 09:14.186
Yes. You see, she's laughing at me.

09:15.787 --> 09:19.097
I am not laughing at you.
I'm smiling for the camera.

09:19.707 --> 09:22.858
Of course you were.
You're about to rip out my heart.

09:24.043 --> 09:28.355
Yes. Yes, here she is plotting her
betrayal in front of the Ponte Vecchio.

09:28.712 --> 09:30.782
How appropriate,
in the country of Lucrezia Borgia.

09:31.088 --> 09:34.125
- Frasier, you're incorrigible.
- Oh, Diane, wait.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.137
No, wait. Hey, let her--

09:36.424 --> 09:39.302
Well, that was a thrill a minute,
huh, Norm?

09:39.842 --> 09:42.151
I'd say your Florida slides
were better than that, Cliffie.

09:42.469 --> 09:45.063
Oh, I got them in the trunk of my car.

09:46.054 --> 09:48.045
It's a good place for them.

09:49.639 --> 09:54.315
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
I thought I was getting better.

09:54.684 --> 09:57.278
Frasier, sit down.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.915
You keep saying you're getting better,

10:00.229 --> 10:02.504
but I haven't seen any evidence of it.

10:02.813 --> 10:07.329
Now, hard as it may be, you've got to
stop being preoccupied with me.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.841
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Enough said.

10:10.108 --> 10:12.019
You don't have to hit Frasier Crane
over the head.

10:12.277 --> 10:14.427
Unless, of course, you'd like to.

10:14.694 --> 10:17.288
Where is your sense of humour?

10:18.031 --> 10:19.783
Frasier, here.

10:20.907 --> 10:24.422
Listen, been a long time since
I went out and raised a little hell.

10:24.783 --> 10:27.536
What do you say you and I go out
and get crazy?

10:27.827 --> 10:31.058
You know, a couple of guys giving
the women of Boston their best shot?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.429
- Well, this is a pity offer, isn't it?
- Basically.

10:34.748 --> 10:36.340
Okay.

10:37.082 --> 10:39.516
Might be just what the doctor ordered.
Rattle my cage a little.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.745
All right, that's the ticket. Listen,
I got a few things to do for a while,

10:43.043 --> 10:45.477
so why don't you just sit down here
and be a good little boy,

10:45.753 --> 10:48.551
and Sammy Claus will take you out
later and get your tree trimmed.

10:53.382 --> 10:55.942
- Hey, Norm.
- Jeff. What are you doing here?

10:56.217 --> 10:58.447
I just wanna have a beer
with the new accounts manager.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.751
- Did I get the job?
- I haven't heard anything definite,

11:01.052 --> 11:04.169
but if I had an extra dollar to wager,
I'd bet it on Norm Peterson.

11:04.472 --> 11:06.702
Since I don't,
could you buy me a beer?

11:07.724 --> 11:09.555
All right. Woody, two beers.

11:09.808 --> 11:11.321
- Come on. Have a seat.
- Great, great.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.511
I just wanted to come down
and wish you good luck.

11:13.769 --> 11:15.805
There's a lot of scuttlebutt
around the water cooler

11:16.060 --> 11:17.857
that you and Morrison
are neck and neck.

11:18.104 --> 11:20.857
But there's a lot of us down in
the trenches who are pulling for you.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.764
Thanks. That means a lot
coming from your peers.

11:24.025 --> 11:26.016
I just hope when you're up
in the executive suite

11:26.275 --> 11:28.470
and I'm down in steerage
we can still be friends.

11:29.151 --> 11:31.107
Of course. Were we before?

11:32.403 --> 11:35.156
"Were we before?"
Oh, God, that's great.

11:35.446 --> 11:37.721
Oh, I tell you, it's gonna be so great

11:37.989 --> 11:40.583
to have somebody up there with
a sense of humour. That's terrific.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.983
And by the way, that was a brilliant job
you did on the Stallings audit.

11:44.327 --> 11:47.205
I mean, who else would've figured out
how to write off Mrs Stallings'

11:47.495 --> 11:50.885
- breast reduction as a depreciation?
- Yeah.

11:52.290 --> 11:56.363
You know, I hear that Stallings will be
eligible for parole in our lifetime.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.925
Does anyone have more fun
than bookkeepers?

12:02.837 --> 12:04.907
Oh, face it, Norm,
you deserve to win.

12:05.171 --> 12:07.241
You're more experienced,
you're a nicer guy,

12:07.506 --> 12:09.736
and you got some professional ethics,
unlike Morrison.

12:10.216 --> 12:11.649
What are you talking about?

12:11.884 --> 12:13.317
Are you kidding?

12:13.551 --> 12:16.668
You don't know about Morrison
and the boss's wife?

12:17.386 --> 12:20.423
They've been making it every
Tuesday night for the past five months.

12:21.930 --> 12:25.240
- Jeffrey, I can't believe that.
- No, I'm serious.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.927
Once a week?

12:29.477 --> 12:32.753
Well, I guess if you're young,
you can handle that kind of schedule.

12:34.229 --> 12:35.662
I better shove off.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.816
- Mrs Reinhardt?
- Mrs Reinhardt.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.175
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.993
Would you promise me one thing?
When you get the promotion

12:43.276 --> 12:46.234
and it's time to hire an assistant,
you'll remember my name?

12:46.569 --> 12:49.641
- Sure. Yeah. What's that last name?
- You big lug, you.

12:49.945 --> 12:53.142
That's Warren, with two R's.
W-A-R-R-E-N.

12:56.949 --> 13:00.146
Well... Woody,
a little champagne, please.

13:00.493 --> 13:04.691
Sammy, some cigars for all my friends.
On the new accounts manager.

13:05.246 --> 13:07.157
No kidding, Norm? You got the job?

13:07.455 --> 13:12.006
No, not yet, but just learned a little bit
of information about my competition

13:12.416 --> 13:15.647
that ought to clinch it
when I accidentally let it slip.

13:16.001 --> 13:17.753
All right, Norm.

13:18.044 --> 13:20.433
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.

13:20.712 --> 13:24.864
Norm, I might have spoken out of turn
about Morrison and Mrs Reinhardt.

13:25.215 --> 13:28.013
You wouldn't let it go any further,
would you?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.655
Jeffrey, I'm insulted, man.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.855
So as I was about to say,
Jeff here lets it slip

13:42.129 --> 13:44.723
that my competition's making
the sheets sing with the boss's wife.

13:45.049 --> 13:47.324
Oh, yeah, that's pretty hot
information there, isn't it?

13:47.636 --> 13:48.955
You're gonna rat on him?

13:49.221 --> 13:52.293
No, I'm gonna sing "Moon River"
outside their motel room.

13:54.061 --> 13:57.690
I know you want this job pretty bad.
You think that's the way to go about it?

13:58.026 --> 14:00.699
I have to agree, Norman.
This just isn't you talking.

14:00.988 --> 14:04.025
You're not the ruthless, cutthroat,
aggressive type.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.886
I don't know where you guys
got the idea that I'm just some

14:07.164 --> 14:09.803
passive, easygoing lump.

14:10.460 --> 14:15.614
Norm, if your buns didn't fall asleep,
you'd never get off the bar stool.

14:18.847 --> 14:22.522
They're wide awake now, guys,
and I want this promotion.

14:23.687 --> 14:26.440
I want it for Vera. She deserves it.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.646
Norman, think for a moment
what you're about to do.

14:30.989 --> 14:32.388
This could even backfire on you.

14:32.616 --> 14:34.925
You don't even know
if this terrible rumour is true.

14:36.081 --> 14:38.754
Well, I have a pretty good idea
it might be.

14:39.043 --> 14:40.999
Mrs Reinhardt came on to me
at the Christmas party.

14:41.796 --> 14:42.911
What did she say?

14:43.131 --> 14:45.361
"Move it. You're standing
in front of the cheese dip."

14:47.179 --> 14:49.647
But she said it with bedroom eyes.

14:49.975 --> 14:51.806
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

14:53.104 --> 14:56.813
You guys all think that this is a bad
idea for me to use this information?

14:57.319 --> 14:58.798
Of course we do.

14:59.738 --> 15:01.376
Not everybody.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.767
You know, Norm,
this Morrison is an adulterer

15:04.036 --> 15:07.073
and shouldn't be allowed
to prosper by it.

15:07.416 --> 15:10.852
Now, if we let this type of un-American
activity go unchecked,

15:11.171 --> 15:13.127
before you know it,
our leaders will be in chains,

15:13.383 --> 15:15.453
our women will be learning
how to shot put,

15:15.719 --> 15:19.268
and all we vital American males
will be force-fed borscht

15:19.600 --> 15:23.195
along with generous helpings
of Das Kapital.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.371
That's not those fish eggs, is it?

15:27.236 --> 15:29.147
No, but it smells as bad.

15:29.866 --> 15:32.983
Well, then you tell them
Woody Boyd says nyet.

15:34.121 --> 15:36.077
Attaboy, Woody.

15:36.875 --> 15:40.948
Norman, a snitch is the lowest thing
on this earth.

15:41.297 --> 15:44.767
You know it. Little kids know it.
Old ladies know it.

15:45.095 --> 15:49.054
Dirty, rotten-toothed prisoners
in dark, wet cells know it.

15:49.768 --> 15:54.125
Norman, if you tell on this guy,
and your friends find out about it,

15:54.484 --> 15:57.203
- they are gonna hate your guts.
- How are they gonna know?

15:57.695 --> 16:00.573
I'll squeal like a stuck pig.

16:01.702 --> 16:03.181
Norm, come on. You can't do this.

16:03.413 --> 16:05.449
All right. You're right, you're right.

16:05.749 --> 16:07.785
Guys don't tell on other guys.

16:08.044 --> 16:09.716
It's just not right. I can't do it.

16:10.257 --> 16:12.088
Hey, Frasier, I'm ready if you are.

16:12.384 --> 16:14.579
Oh, wonderful.
Let's begin our evening of revelry.

16:14.845 --> 16:17.757
All right. Now, listen.
I wanna get one thing straight:

16:18.058 --> 16:20.731
Tonight, I don't wanna hear one word
about Diane Chambers. Okay?

16:21.021 --> 16:23.899
We're gonna get out there and get
your mind on more pleasant things.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.546
Agreed. Where are we going?

16:25.778 --> 16:30.215
Well, I think the first thing we need
is some female companionship.

16:30.576 --> 16:32.931
I know a couple of the hot spots,

16:34.248 --> 16:36.398
so why don't we just
mosey along here.

16:38.963 --> 16:41.318
Let me tell you how
this evening's gonna go here.

16:41.591 --> 16:44.742
Now, we're gonna probably walk
into some really nice little spot there.

16:45.055 --> 16:47.330
You're gonna see a beautiful woman
across the room.

16:47.642 --> 16:49.360
I mean hot, sexy.

16:49.812 --> 16:51.165
A woman you dream about.

16:51.397 --> 16:53.274
All right, now, her friend is for you.

16:55.153 --> 16:56.711
Got it?

17:03.581 --> 17:05.377
Good Lord. That's my boss,
Mr Reinhardt.

17:05.835 --> 17:07.426
That's the poor sap, huh?

17:07.671 --> 17:10.549
Cliffie, quick, breath test.
What do you smell when I do this?

17:11.090 --> 17:13.127
Milwaukee.

17:18.728 --> 17:21.195
Mr Reinhardt.
Hi, sir, how are you do--?

17:21.482 --> 17:24.598
Coincidence that you caught me in
here. I was just using the washroom.

17:24.903 --> 17:26.655
- What do you say we...?
- At ease, Peterson.

17:26.906 --> 17:30.946
We know you spend a lot of time here.
This is where we send your checks.

17:31.329 --> 17:33.604
That's very good.
That's good, sir. That's good.

17:33.875 --> 17:38.153
Well, have a seat.
So to what do I owe this pleasure?

17:38.549 --> 17:41.268
Well, I wanted to come
and tell you in person.

17:41.553 --> 17:44.272
It's not the easiest thing
I've ever had to say,

17:44.557 --> 17:46.513
but you didn't get the job.

17:51.149 --> 17:53.299
I appreciate your coming here
to tell me that, sir.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.960
It was a tossup between you
and Morrison right up to the end.

17:57.283 --> 18:02.915
I have to tell you, in virtually every way,
you match up perfectly.

18:03.375 --> 18:07.163
You both exemplify the high standards
we expect from our employees.

18:07.506 --> 18:10.020
In fact, we can't find a black mark
against either one of you.

18:11.887 --> 18:16.836
Your behaviour and Morrison's,
in and out of the office, is impeccable.

18:18.521 --> 18:20.830
If there were--
If there were just one thing,

18:21.150 --> 18:24.506
one tiny thing to tip the scale
in your favour,

18:25.490 --> 18:27.685
I'd go to bat for you.

18:33.334 --> 18:37.452
Sir, I think I ought
to tell you something.

18:38.883 --> 18:45.197
This is terribly personal,
and it could really be painful for you.

18:46.061 --> 18:49.451
Probably gonna change your life
in every way...

18:51.860 --> 18:53.851
...but before I get into it,

18:54.364 --> 18:56.320
would you like a cheese doodle?

18:56.618 --> 19:00.850
I have a craving for... Could I have
some cheese doodles, please?

19:01.208 --> 19:04.757
- No, Norman.
- Yeah, yes, Norm. Yes, yes.

19:05.129 --> 19:09.327
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, do it, do it. Yes, yes, yes.

19:12.306 --> 19:13.864
Who are those people, Peterson,

19:14.100 --> 19:17.058
and why doesn't one of them
want you to have a cheese doodle?

19:24.032 --> 19:29.345
She's actually-- She's trying to help me
watch my dairy intake, sir.

19:30.499 --> 19:33.218
Well, what was the terribly personal
thing you were gonna tell me

19:33.503 --> 19:36.859
- that's gonna change my life?
- Oh, that.

19:38.343 --> 19:42.131
It was-- That was nothing. You had
something in between your teeth.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.985
Do you have a--? No, no, no. It's--
I guess, you know, it's gone now.

19:46.313 --> 19:48.907
That combination of syllables
in your last sentence

19:49.192 --> 19:51.547
- must have just kicked it right out, sir.
- I see.

19:52.781 --> 19:55.614
- Well, I'd best be going.
- Sir.

19:55.909 --> 19:57.661
There's something you're
not telling me here.

19:57.913 --> 19:59.585
I mean, why didn't I get this job?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.948
Oh, I suppose I owe you
the truth, Peterson.

20:02.211 --> 20:04.247
Well, yeah, you do.

20:04.506 --> 20:06.224
It's your wife.

20:06.549 --> 20:08.141
What does my wife
have to do with this?

20:08.637 --> 20:11.754
Well, she didn't fit in with
the other company wives.

20:13.352 --> 20:16.310
That's-- Vera's a wonderful woman.
What are you talking--?

20:16.606 --> 20:19.200
Well, yes, I'm sure
in her own circle she is,

20:19.485 --> 20:24.115
but that lunch the other wives took
her to yesterday was sort of a test.

20:24.492 --> 20:27.962
A spouse has to be able to mix easily
with other people in the company.

20:28.289 --> 20:31.201
That's just great. Well, that's great.
Sir, tell you what.

20:31.502 --> 20:34.062
If my wife isn't good enough
for this company, neither am l.

20:34.339 --> 20:37.695
Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way,
Peterson. But I understand.

20:38.011 --> 20:40.525
And I admire you
for your loyalty to her.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.685
Now, wait a minute. Morrison's wife is
somehow more acceptable than mine?

20:44.104 --> 20:46.299
No. As a matter of fact,
Morrison's never had a wife.

20:46.691 --> 20:49.808
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't be too sure
about that one, sir.

20:51.782 --> 20:54.660
- Good luck.
- All right, fine.

20:56.412 --> 20:58.323
I'm so sorry, Norman.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.531
Thanks. That was the easy part.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.116
Now I have to break the news
to Vera.

21:07.762 --> 21:09.912
What are you gonna tell her?

21:11.184 --> 21:13.300
The truth, I guess.

21:13.561 --> 21:16.917
When she went to lunch with the
other wives, she didn't pass muster.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.915
Well, maybe she couldn't reach it.

21:33.591 --> 21:35.149
Hi, Vera.

21:35.677 --> 21:38.555
Listen, honey, no point
beating around the bush here.

21:38.848 --> 21:41.043
I didn't get the promotion.

21:41.310 --> 21:45.019
In fact, I just got so mad at the guy,
I just went ahead and quit.

21:47.026 --> 21:50.018
Yeah. Yes. Yes, they did,
they gave me a reason, hon.

21:51.407 --> 21:52.681
They said...

21:53.827 --> 21:55.624
...that...

21:56.373 --> 22:00.730
...well, what they said was, I'm just not
the right man for the job, you know.

22:01.630 --> 22:04.019
You just face it, honey, I'm a loser.

22:04.509 --> 22:08.422
I don't know why you just don't go just
pack up your bags and leave me.

22:08.765 --> 22:10.437
Hello?

22:13.856 --> 22:16.814
That's very funny. That's cute.

22:17.737 --> 22:22.174
Listen, sweetie.
There's something I have to tell you.

22:22.535 --> 22:24.605
Even on a terrible day like today,

22:24.872 --> 22:28.148
I feel like I'm the luckiest man
in the world, because I married you.

22:28.793 --> 22:31.432
I don't know.
I've had two, three, maybe.

22:35.470 --> 22:37.779
I'll talk to you later. Yeah.

22:40.894 --> 22:43.169
- Norman?
- Yeah.

22:44.024 --> 22:47.699
That's one of the finest things
I have ever seen a man do.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.543
Yes.

22:51.868 --> 22:53.540
How great, I'm unemployed.

22:53.829 --> 22:56.184
Don't worry, Mr Peterson.
Something else will come along.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.776
No, no, I mean, great, I'm unemployed.
Give me a beer here.
