ATHENA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.903
My name is Lee Adama,

00:28.987 --> 00:32.657
and I love Kara Thrace!

00:32.866 --> 00:36.619
Did you hear the news? We got
married, can you believe it?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.371
No.

00:38.664 --> 00:39.956
No, I can't
believe it.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.918
Congratulations, Sam, and good
luck. You're gonna need it.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.300
I missed you.
I missed you, too.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.471
GAETA: The child's life must
be protected at all costs.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.684
The first Cylon-human hybrid.
It truly is a miracle from God.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.353
This child will not
be raised by the Cylon,

01:02.438 --> 01:05.189
and we cannot risk Cylon agents
getting their hands on it.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.858
I've made my decision.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.234
We lost her.

01:08.318 --> 01:12.363
We did the best we could, but she's
dead and that's all there is to it.

01:12.698 --> 01:16.033
ROSLIN: As far as the Cylons
know, this child no longer exists.

01:16.118 --> 01:19.162
That is a good,
good thing.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.834
It's Hera.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.336
The first of God's
new generation.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.630
Have you seen the faces
of the other five Cylons?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.382
The ones that
no one has seen?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.677
Why do you want to know about
them? I could be a Cylon.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.721
KAT: I thought our food supply
was inexhaustible.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.807
The food manufacturing
system's been contaminated.

If we just hold on
until Athena gets back,

01:42.144 --> 01:44.228
this algae can
keep us alive indefinitely.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.523
There's a way through the star
cluster, and I found the planet.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.610
There's huge swathes of algae,
just like we thought.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.553
WOMAN 1: There's some
more over here.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.264
MAN 1: All right, I'll just have
one... MAN 2: About 45 meters...

02:20.349 --> 02:22.850
Fourteen inch intake.
Yeah, that's great.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.064
MAN 1: Just pack them
and stack them,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.233
and put them along this
back wall. Right there.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.613
MAN 3: I got your meter readings for the
light. MAN 4: All right. Get those in...

02:35.697 --> 02:38.616
All this can go in the first Raptor,
all that can go in the second one.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.085
Need a hand?
Yeah.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.506
Well, in a couple more days, we can
wrap this up, get away from this stench.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.383
It stinks as bad up here
as it does down there.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.094
At least it tastes as
good as it smells. Yeah.

02:58.178 --> 03:02.431
Well, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner
until someone finds a hot fudge planet.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
Now what is this?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.108
Who the hell is that?

03:13.569 --> 03:15.862
It's Starbuck,
I guess.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.406
Third time this week.

03:18.991 --> 03:23.035
It's amazing how she keeps landing
on the top of the pilot rotation.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.290
Oh, donut runs are
assigned off a coin flip.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.960
Kara probably thinks she's
running a stream of bad luck.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.462
You know, I should
probably get over there.

03:33.547 --> 03:37.300
I'm gonna skip the meet and
greet this time if you don't mind.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.801
Sure.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.557
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:56.320 --> 03:58.154
You brought her in
a little hot, don't you think?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.781
Yeah, well, had I known
I was being graded,

04:00.866 --> 04:03.242
I would have thrown in
a couple barrel rolls.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.170
Remind me to thank the CAG

04:14.254 --> 04:17.340
for sticking me
on these crap donut runs, huh?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.266
This is insane,
you know.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.351
Uh-huh.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.103
That's just the way
I like it.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.359
Should we start
emptying the tents?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.987
Yeah. Get this cleared up
first, and then get to the tents.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.238
Okay.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.742
Here.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.829
Good.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.130
I can barely
look Dee in the eye.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.176
We've got to do
something about this.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.844
Okay, like what?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.305
I don't know.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.932
Like divorce.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.142
Uh-uh. Mmm-mmm.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.147
Oh, come on,
let's get real here.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.733
You said yourself,
things were bad.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.695
Your marriage is failing.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.823
Yeah, but marriage
is a sacrament.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.575
It's not a Pyramid game.
You don't...

05:27.119 --> 05:28.869
You don't get
do-overs, Lee.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.000
I made a vow
in the sight of the Gods

05:34.084 --> 05:35.960
and I'm not gonna
break that.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.256
You're breaking it
every time we do this.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.135
Every time.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.098
Divorce is different.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.392
This is just bending
the rules.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.853

05:54.104 --> 05:56.355
No, no. I'm sorry, I...

05:56.440 --> 05:58.774
I can't.
I can't live like this.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.532
Every time I look at my wife, I see
my own guilt reflected in her eyes.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.368
Oh, wow. Wow, Lee, that
is really poetic of you,

06:09.453 --> 06:12.663
but you don't need to make
that big of a deal out of this.

06:12.748 --> 06:15.332
Well, it is a big deal,
Kara, it is.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.295
It is.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.423
Okay.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.135
So I won't divorce
and you won't cheat.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.641

suggests the Temple's
at least 4,000 years old,

11:56.508 --> 11:59.301
which lines up with the exodus
of the Thirteenth Tribe.

you've found the Temple of Five?

12:01.638 --> 12:02.763
Yeah.

I recognize it from the books in
my father's study, Madam President.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.686
He was a priest and the Temple of Five
was an important part of our faith...

12:09.771 --> 12:11.480
Well, his faith, anyway.

from sneaking into my dad's

12:24.119 --> 12:27.955
The Eye of Jupiter. What
exactly are we talking about?

12:28.331 --> 12:29.456
According to the scriptures,

12:29.541 --> 12:32.918
it's a marker that was left

Enough.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.758

is somewhere in that Temple

13:21.843 --> 13:23.552
and it really is a marker
on the way to Earth...

Something's odd here. Cylons
aren't launching Raiders.

Baseships are standing off,
outside of weapons range.

genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.308
This is Gaius Baltar.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.033
ROSLIN: I can't believe we're
allowing Cylons on this ship.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.493
They must want
something pretty bad

14:29.577 --> 14:32.329
or else they would've started
shooting as soon as they jumped in.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.664
Why would they send Baltar?

14:33.748 --> 14:36.250
They've got to know we
won't believe a word he says.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.834
He can say
whatever he wants.

14:37.919 --> 14:42.631
The longer he talks, the more time we have
to get Lee and his people off of the planet.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.674
It feels like old times,
doesn't it?

15:27.802 --> 15:30.387
I can't believe how much
I actually miss this place.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.514
You know you can't return.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.518
They'd toss you out the nearest
airlock, and then throw a party.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.520
Yes, I know.

15:41.232 --> 15:44.610
Still, I can't help
the feeling I'm finally

15:44.694 --> 15:45.819
home.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.615
If you're really a Cylon,
a member of the Final Five,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.367
these feelings are just
part of your programming,

15:52.452 --> 15:53.869
part of your cover.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.455
And if I'm a human being
after all?

15:57.248 --> 15:58.790
If I'm not one
of the Final Five,

15:58.875 --> 16:02.419
then this is the last chance I'll
ever get to see my kind again.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.398

hardly necessary.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.817
Yes, exactly.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.485
We come in peace.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.780
What do you want?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.826
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.912
So let's just skip all the
denials and protestations,

18:00.997 --> 18:02.122
and go straight to it.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.916
We know that you have
people on the ground,

18:05.001 --> 18:09.463
and we know that you've found the original
settlement of the Thirteenth Tribe.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.841
It also doesn't take a lot
of deduction to conclude

18:12.925 --> 18:17.512
that the only reason you haven't cut
your losses and jumped away by now

18:17.597 --> 18:20.182
is that you've probably
found the artifact,

18:20.266 --> 18:23.518
but you haven't been
able to retrieve it yet.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.353
Is that about right,
Madam President?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.938
We have our people
on the surface.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.815
We're not
leaving them behind.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.235
That's a touching,
but not very convincing idea.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.197
Look, the chances that we've all
converged on this small planet

18:35.281 --> 18:38.116
at the same time are
infinitesimally small.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.994
So, we will understand
it's not chance.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.289
You want the Eye,
the Cylons want the Eye.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.085
I would like to discuss the
practical issues that come to hand,

18:49.170 --> 18:50.128
and there are some,

18:50.213 --> 18:52.297
so that we can reach
some accommodation.

The less this man says,
the better this will go.

If it wasn't for me, the Cylons
would have blown you out of the sky

18:59.847 --> 19:01.807
two seconds
after we'd arrived.

19:01.891 --> 19:06.102
I think you can handle this
alone, if you can stomach it.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.230
So, I've saved your life

19:08.314 --> 19:09.773
again.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.317
How many times is that, now?
Because I'm beginning to lose count.

you'd all be dead!

You give us the Eye of
Jupiter, we'll let you go.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.376
And we'll throw in Baltar.

I'm improvising.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.507
Throw in something
to sweeten the pot.

19:35.591 --> 19:39.511
Besides, I suspect that the
Admiral and Madam President

19:39.595 --> 19:43.598
would enjoy some nice, quiet,
private time with the former leader.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.227
Am I right?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.021
Worth thinking about.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.610
Definitely worth
thinking about.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.244
Despite that uniform,
it's not your home anymore.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.708
I've made my choice and I
know where my loyalties lie.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.590
What if I told you that your
daughter was still alive?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.096
I'd say you were lying.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.015
Well, someone's lying.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.642
But it's not me.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.438
Hera's alive.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.151
At least for now.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.154
She's ill,
and we don't know why.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.697
Yeah, right.

20:41.991 --> 20:45.535
Baltar found her on New
Caprica during the evacuation.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.997
She's on our baseship
right now.

20:49.957 --> 20:54.377
From what we could gather, she was
hidden at Laura Roslin's school,

20:54.462 --> 20:58.882
which means that she probably planned
the whole thing in the first place.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.927
I don't need to listen
to this. Watch her.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.220
They let you think
that she was dead!

21:04.305 --> 21:06.598
You don't do that to a person,
you do that to a thing!

21:06.682 --> 21:08.600
That's what your friends
think of you, Sharon!

21:08.684 --> 21:11.478
You're not one of them!
You're a thing!

21:13.022 --> 21:16.107
We're not giving you the key
to finding Earth.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.696
You try bringing it up from
that planet and see what happens.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.990
We outnumber you
four to one.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.711
I'm setting the terms now.

21:37.380 --> 21:43.551
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,

21:43.636 --> 21:46.012
I'll launch every
nuke I've got.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.266
Lay waste
to the entire continent.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.396
You're bluffing.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.192
You want to find Earth
as much as we do.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.323
Guards, escort them
back to their ship.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.741
GUARD: Yes, sir.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.162
(DOOR OPENING)

22:27.471 --> 22:29.514
APOLLO: Well, it would help if
I knew what I was looking for.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.433
Does it really
look like an eye?

22:31.684 --> 22:32.934
ROSLIN: I don't know, Lee.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.020
I've looked at the scriptures
and they make reference

22:35.104 --> 22:37.397
to the Eye being left
in some sort of Temple,

22:37.481 --> 22:39.858
but there's no
physical description.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.111
All we know for sure is that it
supposedly points the way to Earth.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.779
And you believe that?

22:45.531 --> 22:48.533
The Cylons do. I can't take
a chance that they're right.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.036
If it looks like they're
gonna get into the Temple,

22:51.120 --> 22:52.287
your order is to blow it.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.750
Understood. What's my...

22:56.834 --> 22:58.209
(SHRILL BEEPING)

22:58.294 --> 23:00.003
What's going on?

23:00.087 --> 23:03.965
The Cylons are jamming
the wireless, every frequency.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.054
Okay, we need to establish
hard communications,

23:09.138 --> 23:12.599
work out a plan to defend this
Temple while Tyrol searches.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.269
Defend it with what? A dozen
Marines, maybe five more military?

23:16.353 --> 23:18.146
We're gonna have
to draft the civilians.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.523
Can I make a suggestion
that you won't like?

23:20.608 --> 23:22.776
Do you make
any other kind?

23:24.612 --> 23:26.946
Use Sam to command
the civilians.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.742
You're not serious.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.419
Lee.
Hey, Sam.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.838
Hi.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.175
Heard you were coming down.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.846
Guess it takes an emergency to
get us in the same room these days.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.599
Can we do this later,
please?

23:54.683 --> 23:56.935
APOLLO: Sam, I need you
to command the civilians.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.603
Form them into fire teams.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.397
I'll give my deployment orders
through Sergeant... Whoa, whoa.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.151
Wait. Deployment orders?
Fire teams?

24:05.236 --> 24:08.780
Come on, some of these guys have
never even held a rifle before.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.951
Well, you're supposed to be the expert
in turning civilians into soldiers.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.870
No, no, no.
We were guerilla fighters.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.288
All right? Hit and run.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.791
Keep moving,
keep the enemy off-balance.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.253
I've never had to defend a fixed
position, that's a whole different game.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.879
Well, then, you're just
gonna have to learn it fast,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.507
because that's what we're doing,
we're defending this fixed position

24:27.591 --> 24:29.300
until the Chief finds
this Eye of Jupiter.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.511
Oh, okay, so you want us
to risk our lives

24:31.595 --> 24:33.471
for something that you
haven't even found yet?

24:33.556 --> 24:36.349
Listen, Sam,
I'm not even sure it exists.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.935
But I don't have to tell you
every little gods-damn detail...

24:39.019 --> 24:40.478
No, you know what you
have to explain to me...

24:40.563 --> 24:42.689
Hey, hey, hey...

24:45.067 --> 24:47.569
The Major's in charge
of this one, okay?

24:48.904 --> 24:50.029
Okay?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.197
Huh.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.909
Well, I certainly wouldn't want
to step between you and your Major.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.797
Well, I thought
that went really well.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.257
He'll do it.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.717
He better.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.486
(BEEPS)

25:33.741 --> 25:35.366
I miss Nicky.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.076
Do you think he's okay?

25:37.161 --> 25:38.494
Yes, he's fine.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.372
He's on Galactica.
He's fine.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.749
I know.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.589
You know, when I was growing up,
I hated everything about the faith,

25:49.673 --> 25:53.551
the rules, the rituals, endless
discussions at the dinner table.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.306
I used to sneak into my mom's prayer
room, you know, holiest of the holies,

25:58.390 --> 26:02.185
and I would dance around naked with
porn magazines just to defy the Gods

26:02.269 --> 26:04.771
and tell them to frak off.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.357
I mean, I don't even know
how I found this place.

26:07.441 --> 26:13.112
I just got this urge to start
walking, and then suddenly here it is.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.078
Well, you should see the look
on your face when you're in here.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.289
There's this reverence.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.960
You even talk softer.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.676
I feel something in here.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.679
Something true.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.852
But here I am setting charges
in this special place.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.274
The holiest of the holies.
This is

26:50.943 --> 26:52.735
the Temple of Five.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.322
If my parents
could see this.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.746
And I'm gonna
blow it up.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.594
GAETA: I noticed some anomalies
in the solar radiation belt.

27:18.679 --> 27:22.223
I made an analysis
of the star's vibration modes.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.060
Sure enough, it appears
to be highly unstable.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.397
If you can believe it, on
the verge of going supernova.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.690
When?

27:31.567 --> 27:33.776
It could be tomorrow,
it could be next year.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.237
There's no way
of knowing for sure, sir.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.282
When it does happen, the only
warning that we're likely to get

27:39.366 --> 27:42.827
is a fast helium flash, at which
point we'll have to jump out of here

27:42.911 --> 27:46.122
before it obliterates
the entire planetary system.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.335
Sir, I'm not one to look
for religious signs,

27:50.419 --> 27:53.546
but I can't get my head
around these odds.

27:54.757 --> 27:59.677
That human and Cylon both converge
on this planet at this exact moment,

27:59.762 --> 28:02.847
just as the star is
about to go supernova?

28:02.931 --> 28:06.351
I'm not a religious person,
Mr. Gaeta, as you both know.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.355
So if this is the work
of a higher power,

28:10.439 --> 28:13.274
then they have one hell
of a sense of humor.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.866
We have a stand-off.
Very predictable.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.702
They have the Eye, and they'll
nuke it if we try to take it,

28:24.787 --> 28:28.998
and we'll shoot them down if they
try bringing it up to Galactica.

28:29.083 --> 28:32.377
Are we sure they have it? How
do we know they're not bluffing?

28:32.461 --> 28:33.878
You don't.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.714
We Threes feel that we can't
afford to take the chance.

28:36.799 --> 28:40.676
I think we're missing
the big picture here.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.222
We have the opportunity
to rid the universe

28:44.306 --> 28:47.475
of the human pestilence
once and for all.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.520
We can discuss that after
we get the Eye of Jupiter,

28:50.604 --> 28:52.063
after we find
the path to Earth.

28:52.147 --> 28:57.735
Let me point out that it doesn't
matter if we find Earth in five days,

28:57.820 --> 29:01.614
or if we find Earth
in 5,000 years.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.491
We're machines,

29:03.992 --> 29:07.662
we'll still be around
to savor the great miracle.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.082
So let them destroy the Eye,

29:11.166 --> 29:13.960
if indeed they have it.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.129
We have to take advantage
of the situation

29:16.213 --> 29:19.507
and take down Galactica
once and for all.

29:21.552 --> 29:24.554
Or we could stand here
and do nothing.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.014
We're not doing nothing,
Cavil.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.350
Plans are in motion.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.394
I'm sorry.
What was that?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.105
D'Anna.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.899
I've put a Heavy Raider down
on the planet's surface

29:36.984 --> 29:38.484
as soon as we jumped in.

29:38.569 --> 29:42.113
I thought that would be our best
chance of slipping by their dradis.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.073
Seems I was right.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.785
Was there any particular reason the rest
of us weren't involved in this decision?

29:47.870 --> 29:49.787
It was a need-to-know
mission.

29:49.872 --> 29:52.915
So, now I am telling you,
because you need to know.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.626
The point is, we have cut off
their troops' communications

29:55.711 --> 29:57.837
and we have put our own
troops on the ground.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.048
So, as soon as the Centurions
retrieve the Eye,

30:01.133 --> 30:03.134
you can take out Galactica.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.955
Okay, here's the deal.
We're out of options.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.166
The Cylons have got us
pinned on this rock

30:35.250 --> 30:37.627
and our only way out of here
is to hold this place

30:37.711 --> 30:40.546
until Galactica can send
a rescue party.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.174
So I've divided you
into two teams, okay?

30:43.258 --> 30:46.677
Team One is gonna be distributing
ammunition throughout the camp.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.847
Team Two is gonna be
making homemade tylium mines.

30:49.932 --> 30:50.932
Great.
Great.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.059
I know that's
not glamorous work,

30:53.477 --> 30:55.144
but we're gonna need
the extra firepower

30:55.229 --> 30:58.439
in case the Cylons decide
to take a shot at us.

31:00.317 --> 31:03.069
Look, I know some
of you are scared,

31:03.153 --> 31:06.155
and that's okay,
because I'm scared, too.

31:07.199 --> 31:11.118
But if we keep our heads and
we do our jobs, we can do this.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.371
We can all get out
of here in one piece.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.748
Now, Barolay has the list of
your names and your assignments.

31:15.832 --> 31:19.001
Make sure you get with her.
I'll see you outside.

31:25.968 --> 31:28.427
That was good, honest.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.722
You'd make a good officer.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.725
An officer, huh?

31:36.186 --> 31:37.853
Like you?

31:37.938 --> 31:41.566
Someone who swears an oath
and knows how to keep it?

31:45.779 --> 31:47.363
I'm not really sure
what you think is going on...

31:47.447 --> 31:50.491
Don't insult me, okay.
I'm not stupid.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.083
I know my wife.
I know how she is.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.085
We've been married
for a year-and-a-half.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.879
What, you think
you're the first?

32:07.009 --> 32:10.177
I chose to marry Kara.
That's my business.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.722
But you?

32:13.181 --> 32:15.725
I don't know what the hell
you think you're trying to do.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.062
Look, I'm trying
to fight a war.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.691
I'm trying to get these people
off this rock in one piece.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.027
Anything for the cause, Major.

32:35.370 --> 32:40.207
Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing
the faces of the Final Five Cylons.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.752
Maybe the face
of God himself.

32:45.380 --> 32:49.383
The Five Lights of the apocalypse
rising, struggling towards the light,

32:49.468 --> 32:53.721
sins revealed only to those who enter
the Temple, only to the Chosen One...

32:53.805 --> 33:03.731
The Chosen One...
The Chosen One...

33:04.149 --> 33:08.235
The Five await me.
The Chosen One...

33:09.112 --> 33:11.489
Gaius, I'm so close
to knowing the truth.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.948
CAPRICA SIX: What truth?

33:15.035 --> 33:16.327
Caprica.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.165
I'd like to think that we
three have shared something,

33:21.249 --> 33:23.959
have transcended the barriers
that separate people,

33:24.044 --> 33:27.129
and yet, somehow,
the more time goes on,

33:27.214 --> 33:30.383
the more I find myself
on the outside looking in.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.386
Well, that's not
the case at all, is it?

33:33.762 --> 33:35.846
Because we three,
we're integral,

33:35.931 --> 33:38.057
we're part of...
We're finished.

33:41.603 --> 33:48.109
Baltar and my destiny lie
separate from yours, Caprica.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.622
The Five Lights will be revealed
only to those who enter the Temple.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.254
We have to go down
to the planet.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.548
Only you and I can
see this through.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.259
What are you after?

34:13.343 --> 34:15.636
What is this secret
that you keep pursuing?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.222
You have to
tell me the truth.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.682
I love you both.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.308
We love you, too.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.147
But this is something
you cannot share with us.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.691
Something I can't
share with you?

34:28.775 --> 34:31.068
I loved you when everyone
else wanted you dead.

34:31.153 --> 34:33.738
Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.490
It's not personal.

34:38.243 --> 34:41.829
It's transcendent. It's like
what you said, it's transcendent.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.751
Pray for us, Caprica.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.504
We'll be praying for you.

35:09.983 --> 35:13.194
Okay, he wants us to set up
forward observation posts

35:13.278 --> 35:15.112
hardwired back to base
for communications.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.740
The obs are gonna be staggered
at strategic locations,

35:17.824 --> 35:21.702
giving us as much warning as
possible if there is a Cylon advance.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.581
Since we only have one Raptor,
Captain Thrace will fly point.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.749
Oh, joy.

35:26.833 --> 35:31.253
Wireless is dead, so if you
do make contact, do not engage.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.880
Fly to the closest
observation post,

35:32.964 --> 35:35.549
have them relay the
information back to command.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.385
Be sure to note force strength,
direction of march and position.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.138
I have flown recon
once or twice, Lieutenant.

35:41.223 --> 35:46.393
Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna
set up an observation post here.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.271
Henick and Ditko,
you go here.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.482
And who gets
lucky number three?

35:51.566 --> 35:54.360
That would be
Sergeant Fischer and me.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.446
Do you have a problem
with that, Captain?

35:57.531 --> 35:59.114
No.
We go in an hour.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.334
Green Base, Foxfire One.
Green Base, Foxfire One.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.878
We are open
for business, over.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.058
(ALARM SOUNDING)

36:27.394 --> 36:28.477
Son of a bitch.

36:31.940 --> 36:32.940
(BEEPING)

36:33.024 --> 36:34.525
Tell me you're seeing this.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.986
DUALLA:
She's relaying a message.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.029
It's Centurions!

36:40.991 --> 36:42.199
Starbuck's been hit!

36:42.284 --> 36:44.118
I say again,
Starbuck's going down!

36:45.537 --> 36:46.704
(SCREAMS)

36:59.134 --> 37:01.552
There's really not much more
on the Eye in these scriptures,

37:01.636 --> 37:04.221
but there's several interesting
stories about the Temple.

37:04.306 --> 37:05.389
Listen to this...

37:05.473 --> 37:08.893
"Five pillars of the Temple
were fashioned after

37:08.977 --> 37:11.228
"the Five Priests devoted to
the One Whose Name Cannot... "

37:11.313 --> 37:12.479
Laura.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.731
What?

37:15.025 --> 37:18.569
The Cylon we know as Boomer
arrived with the others.

37:20.071 --> 37:24.742
She told our Sharon
that her child was alive,

37:24.826 --> 37:27.620
and that she was onboard
one of the Cylon baseships.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.207
And that she had been seen on
New Caprica, in your school.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.886
The child is alive.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.976
Yes, yes.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.439
The child was at the school.
Yes, I kept her there.

37:55.523 --> 37:59.693
And we suspected that the Cylons
captured her during the exodus

38:00.278 --> 38:03.238
from New Caprica.
Yes, it's true.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.702
Listen, the thing you might
want to know is that when...

38:11.289 --> 38:12.539
(DOOR OPENS)

38:22.425 --> 38:25.386
Do you have any idea
what we've gone through?

38:31.601 --> 38:33.352
You, of all people...

38:37.399 --> 38:40.234
Know what it's like
to lose a child.

38:42.404 --> 38:46.073
The difference is,
your child is still alive.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.912
Eventually, I hope
you become grateful of that.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.555
I want to see her.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.687
What do you mean she's
gone down? Gone down where?

39:16.771 --> 39:18.439
Somewhere in
the North Valley.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.149
Okay, get your men
on the line.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.275
Full ammo loads.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.693
They're coming from the
north. What about Kara?

39:22.777 --> 39:25.237
We're gonna set up
a rescue party, right?

39:26.823 --> 39:28.032
No.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.951
We don't have the manpower.
We have to defend the position.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.995
Lee, she could
be dying out there.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.455
Yeah, I know that,
Sam. I know.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.207
But we are thin on the ground here
and the Cylons are on the march.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.461
We can't help her. We
have to hold our positions.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.340
Are you out of your
frakking mind?

39:51.598 --> 39:54.767
We just picked up six Heavy Raiders
falling away from the Cylon fleet.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.727
Definitely heading down
toward the planet.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.228
I don't get it.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.230
They have to know
we see them.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.024
They're testing us.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.235
Want to know if we're bluffing
about nuking the planet.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.321
Well, unfortunately,
we are bluffing.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.198
Are we?

40:12.452 --> 40:14.244
Mr. Hoshi.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.874
Order nuclear ground strike missiles
into launch tubes four through ten.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.375
HOSHI: Aye, sir.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.795
This is a nuclear
mission order.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.590
The Major's right.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.093
We don't have any troops to spare
if we're gonna hold this position.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.761
Screw this position!

40:30.845 --> 40:32.971
Listen, we can take those
hills, use guerilla tactics,

40:33.056 --> 40:34.431
that's what I've been talking
about this whole time.

40:34.516 --> 40:37.184
No, that is not the mission. We
have our orders. We are stronger...

40:37.268 --> 40:39.603
What are you, some gods-damn
wind-up tin soldier?

40:39.729 --> 40:43.107
This is my wife we're talking
about! Yeah, I know who she is!

40:43.191 --> 40:46.026
And I have known her and cared about
her a hell of a lot longer than you!

40:46.152 --> 40:48.237
Don't start lecturing me! You
can do whatever the frak you want!

40:48.321 --> 40:50.531
I am going after my wife!

40:51.699 --> 40:53.200
Missiles are loaded,
Admiral.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.119
Open launch tube doors.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.453
(BEEPING)

40:57.539 --> 40:59.498
Doors are open, Admiral.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.792
What are you doing?

41:02.710 --> 41:05.420
I'm getting ready
to nuke the planet.

41:15.098 --> 41:18.851
Radiological detection. They've
opened their missile doors.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.727
He's bluffing.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.358
I can't let you do that, Sam. I
am not asking you for permission.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.193
Sergeant Mathias.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.709
Load target package
Three-Bravo.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.753
Set ground zero for the
underground structure.

41:49.215 --> 41:51.592
ROSLIN: Are we prepared
to sacrifice Lee?

41:53.178 --> 41:54.636
They're loading
a targeting package.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.555
It's a bluff.
Don't let him rattle you.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.850
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.186
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch it.

42:02.270 --> 42:06.356
And D'Anna was explicit that she and
Baltar make it to the planet's surface.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.776
CAPRICA SIX: So, is that
what all this is really about?

42:14.824 --> 42:20.162
And the heavens opened up
and they saw the Eye,

42:20.288 --> 42:23.540
(BEEPING) but where
is that frakking Eye?

42:23.833 --> 42:27.085
Are you kidding me?
You gonna shoot me now?

42:29.088 --> 42:31.798
I can't let you go.
I need you on the line.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.759
I need you commanding
those civilians.

42:33.843 --> 42:36.887
I'm sorry, Sam,
but you cannot go.

42:36.971 --> 42:41.266
I'm sorry, too, Major,
but you can't stop me.

42:46.689 --> 42:50.025
Release of nuclear weapons
is now authorized.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.193
Sir.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.584
