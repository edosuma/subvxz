00:21.813 --> 00:24.149
It's here. They're unloading the Rolls.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.634
- Miss Prince?
- Yes.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.177
You're right on time.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.638
One custom 1935 Rolls-Royce Laundalet...

00:55.722 --> 00:57.891
with platinum hood ornament
coming right up.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.225
Thank you very much, sir.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.729
Always a pleasure to accommodate
the IADC.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.397
All right, fellows,
let's get the doors open.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.819
So what do we got going on here?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.739
Some kind of a spy caper or something?

01:36.262 --> 01:39.807
That's a Rolls, all right.
But ain't it kind of small?

01:56.365 --> 01:58.075
Stop that car.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.065
Raise this higher.

04:52.123 --> 04:53.791
Move it to the left.

05:42.673 --> 05:45.426
Wonder Woman,
what is happening, sister?

05:45.843 --> 05:47.553
What's in the back?

05:56.270 --> 05:59.148
I don't know, ma'am,
I guess it was a mix-up.

05:59.231 --> 06:02.985
Someone must have goofed
and sent two trucks to the same place.

06:03.152 --> 06:05.779
I don't know nothing about a stolen car.

06:05.863 --> 06:08.198
Did you get a good look
at the other driver?

06:08.282 --> 06:09.908
No, ma'am...

06:09.992 --> 06:13.871
he was so teed off about the mix-up
he refused to get out of the cab.

06:13.954 --> 06:16.164
At least, that's what it looked like.

06:32.681 --> 06:35.559
Nobody told me that the IADC...

06:35.642 --> 06:38.019
and two females were going to interfere.

06:39.563 --> 06:42.607
- Interfere?
- Would you settle for "meddle"?

06:42.858 --> 06:44.901
For your information, Inspector Bolt...

06:44.985 --> 06:47.028
Wonder Woman
and I were trying to retrieve-

06:47.112 --> 06:50.282
For your information, Agent Prince,
I was there on a tip...

06:50.365 --> 06:53.660
that could've busted the biggest
car theft ring since original sin!

06:53.743 --> 06:57.414
I was going to tail that Rolls-Royce
to its original source.

06:57.497 --> 06:59.874
And, I suppose,
you think your car thieves...

06:59.958 --> 07:02.419
are more important than national security.

07:02.502 --> 07:05.338
- My car thieves?
- All right.

07:05.422 --> 07:07.924
Enough squabbling, for crying out loud.

07:09.592 --> 07:13.012
You want the man
behind the car theft ring, right?

07:13.096 --> 07:14.180
Right.

07:14.305 --> 07:17.809
Diana, you and I want that hood ornament
off the antique Rolls.

07:17.892 --> 07:20.353
Now it's been decided and agreed upon...

07:20.436 --> 07:22.939
that the two of you
will be working together.

07:23.022 --> 07:25.733
Okay.

07:27.485 --> 07:29.279
Maybe I was off base.

07:30.572 --> 07:34.158
I take it all back. Except, the female part.

07:35.618 --> 07:37.829
You are most definitely female.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.126
Since birth.

07:45.169 --> 07:47.755
Good, now that we have
our genders straight...

07:47.839 --> 07:50.883
what can you tell us about
this car theft organization?

07:55.179 --> 07:57.390
- Hello.
- Sorry.

07:58.057 --> 08:00.726
Well, I've been after these guys
for quite some time now.

08:00.810 --> 08:03.855
And I've yet to get a specific line
on their operations.

08:03.938 --> 08:06.816
So I know they got to have
a headquarters somewhere, right?

08:06.899 --> 08:09.485
Some kind of drop for all these hot cars.

08:09.569 --> 08:13.614
Someplace where they can remove
the serial numbers, change the paint jobs.

08:13.990 --> 08:16.617
- You have no idea where this drop is?
- No.

08:16.701 --> 08:19.704
They always manage to
just slip away from me.

08:20.037 --> 08:22.581
Like today. But this time I know the buyer.

08:22.665 --> 08:24.959
An ophthalmologist, Dr. Samson.

08:25.042 --> 08:28.254
They concentrate primarily
on classic cars?

08:28.712 --> 08:32.006
Classics, antiques,
refurbished old sports jobs.

08:32.091 --> 08:36.720
Do you know there is a billion-dollar
business just on stolen parts alone?

08:36.886 --> 08:39.807
Samson would pay over a $100,000
for that Rolls.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.684
And even more if they could get him
a Duesenberg instead.

08:42.768 --> 08:45.062
And the man behind this ring?

08:46.146 --> 08:48.232
Another big question mark.

08:48.315 --> 08:51.652
Unless you subscribe to the theory
that all crimes fit...

08:51.735 --> 08:53.737
the personality of the perpetrator.

08:53.821 --> 08:56.198
In which case, our man...

08:56.281 --> 08:59.201
number one, is a gambler, a businessman.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.912
Efficient, well organized.

09:02.579 --> 09:06.583
And someone in touch with big money.

09:09.419 --> 09:11.463
Sam, what are you doing to me?

09:12.047 --> 09:14.341
Sell short. Yes, short!

09:15.843 --> 09:17.719
Yeah? Hold on.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.598
And buy the June bellies 10 minutes
before the bell.

09:22.224 --> 09:23.892
Go ahead, I'm listening.

09:24.559 --> 09:26.812
For 40 acres?

09:28.355 --> 09:29.564
All right.

09:30.232 --> 09:31.566
Brazil?

09:32.526 --> 09:34.403
Arbitrate and call back.

09:35.862 --> 09:39.449
Wondering, maybe we can get a hold
of a Duesenberg?

09:39.533 --> 09:40.951
We can give it a try.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.036
Sounds like you have a plan, Inspector.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.413
Best plan since Hannibal crossed the Alps.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.290
- Brilliant?
- But risky.

10:03.181 --> 10:05.016
Now just one second.

10:07.185 --> 10:09.521
There you go, Doc. Over this way.

10:10.063 --> 10:11.481
This is the Man.

10:11.564 --> 10:14.776
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Dr. Samson,
been one of those days.

10:14.859 --> 10:17.737
I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage, Mr...

10:17.946 --> 10:21.616
As intended, sir, my identity
remains a mystery to my clients...

10:21.699 --> 10:24.953
and all but my closest associates.
As intended.

10:25.328 --> 10:29.040
You are prepared to fill my order?
The 1935 Laundalet?

10:29.707 --> 10:34.420
For $100,000 in Swiss francs,
drawable on a Swiss account, yes.

10:36.589 --> 10:38.132
Make it $75,000.

10:39.008 --> 10:42.595
Split the difference,
and allow me to keep this.

10:53.022 --> 10:56.609
- A sentimental addition to my collection.
- Done.

10:57.693 --> 11:01.239
Why quibble? There must be hundreds
of ladies like her.

11:02.615 --> 11:03.908
It looks like this one...

11:03.991 --> 11:06.452
but the lady we're after
is very much one-of-a-kind.

11:06.536 --> 11:10.206
And more important to Uncle Sam
than the cars are to the police.

11:10.289 --> 11:13.459
Please remember that, Inspector,
in case your plan works.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.504
You can have your lady.
All I want is the Man.

11:17.046 --> 11:18.547
- You ready, partner?
- Yes.

11:18.631 --> 11:21.884
Just a minute.
Neither of you are quite ready yet.

11:22.259 --> 11:25.096
Diana, I have a lovely broach for you.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.808
It's a tiny microphone,
pick up every word you say.

11:28.891 --> 11:32.645
- I guess I'll have to watch my language.
- I certainly hope so.

11:32.728 --> 11:34.522
This is for you, Inspector.

11:35.940 --> 11:38.818
- A ballpoint tape recorder.
- Clever.

11:38.901 --> 11:41.445
- And that?
- And don't forget your camera.

11:41.529 --> 11:44.490
And remember, Inspector,
you are Arnie Lippincott.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.951
Small time thief with big ideas.

11:47.701 --> 11:49.078
Excellent!

11:50.037 --> 11:51.622
How are your eyes?

11:52.289 --> 11:56.085
Funny you should mention it,
they've been bothering me lately.

11:57.044 --> 11:58.462
"L-P-E-D."

12:02.549 --> 12:04.385
Now what do you see?

12:04.635 --> 12:07.304
I see 1935 Rolls-Royce Laundalet.

12:09.139 --> 12:11.391
- I beg your pardon.
- No, wait...

12:11.642 --> 12:14.061
it's an SJ-type Duesenberg.

12:14.728 --> 12:18.106
A Duesenberg that a certain
ophthalmologist has been looking for.

12:18.190 --> 12:20.442
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:22.402 --> 12:25.697
I know that you've been
putting out feelers for...

12:26.114 --> 12:29.159
a 1934 SJ-type Doozie.

12:29.493 --> 12:32.621
With dual windshields, front and rear...

12:33.121 --> 12:36.458
dual side mounts, body by Rollston...

12:37.209 --> 12:41.922
powered by the original
supercharged straight eight.

12:42.964 --> 12:45.384
You can get one for me?

12:50.764 --> 12:53.975
You never really wanted that Rolls-Royce,
did you?

12:54.059 --> 12:57.854
Not if I can get a 34 SJ-type Doozie.

13:14.913 --> 13:15.914
Yes?

13:16.164 --> 13:18.458
Samson didn't show to pick up the Rolls.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.085
Could be cold feet.

13:20.251 --> 13:23.129
- Could be competition.
- Yes, could be.

13:24.172 --> 13:26.591
Do you know what to do
in that eventuality?

13:26.674 --> 13:28.551
Yeah, I know what to do.

13:33.765 --> 13:34.974
Sure do.

13:54.952 --> 13:56.162
Hi.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.875
- Dr. Samson, Arnie Lippincott.
- Shall we?

14:34.033 --> 14:35.409
Let me drive her.

14:35.493 --> 14:38.579
No driving, not until the trade is made.

14:38.871 --> 14:42.500
- Tomorrow, I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- Then it's settled?

14:42.875 --> 14:46.128
We trade straight across,
this Doozie for the Rolls.

14:47.046 --> 14:48.422
Any day.

14:48.506 --> 14:50.883
Then that lady will be happy
to take you for a drive.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.225
There isn't going to be any trade.

15:05.564 --> 15:06.899
Brilliant.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.443
But risky.

15:24.249 --> 15:26.835
You had an appointment
with a Rolls remember, Doctor?

15:26.919 --> 15:30.088
But I gave him better merchandise
at a better price.

15:31.006 --> 15:32.799
Well, the trade's off.

15:33.258 --> 15:35.510
And I'm taking the Doozie to boot.

15:35.594 --> 15:38.180
- Just for wasting my time.
- Oh, no.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.601
Go for them, baby!

16:36.613 --> 16:39.657
- Its okay. You're a thinker, not a fighter.
- A thinker?

16:40.783 --> 16:43.036
If brains were rain
he couldn't make a drop.

16:43.119 --> 16:46.372
Let's go, wise guy,
you're not out of the woods yet.

16:56.424 --> 16:59.844
Steve, I take it you heard
what just went on back there?

17:00.094 --> 17:04.140
We didn't get the Rolls, but they did take
Bolt with them, just like you figured.

17:05.266 --> 17:08.102
So I'm going to take Dr. Samson
down to the police station...

17:08.185 --> 17:11.063
for a little chat with our friend,
Lt. Cline. Then I'll be in.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.793
Sounds like you're
putting on weight, Alfie.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.173
You know, Lippincott...

17:38.257 --> 17:41.802
you'd look like what's on my plate
if I had my way.

17:42.178 --> 17:45.890
Don't tell me you've gone
and lost your way now.

17:46.098 --> 17:49.351
First a Duesenberg, then a fight,
and now your way.

17:49.935 --> 17:53.647
You better watch out, Alfie,
next thing you know, it'll be your job.

18:00.237 --> 18:02.031
You know that sound?

18:02.531 --> 18:04.366
Yeah, I know that sound.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.244
If you don't want to hear
the one that follows...

18:07.369 --> 18:08.829
lay off of me.

18:09.913 --> 18:11.165
You bet.

18:40.235 --> 18:43.405
Your credentials have been checked,
Mr. Lippincott.

18:43.614 --> 18:45.866
- Passed inspection.
- Naturally.

18:46.074 --> 18:48.410
So what do you want from me now?

18:48.702 --> 18:50.579
Not much, actually.

18:50.871 --> 18:53.665
Simply instruct your female associate...

18:54.332 --> 18:56.793
to deliver that Duesenberg into my hands.

18:56.877 --> 19:00.005
Your hands?
My foot, that's my Duesenberg.

19:00.088 --> 19:03.049
Keep your greasy meat hooks off it,
whatever your name is.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.010
My impetuous friend...

19:05.927 --> 19:09.723
- that Duesenberg is worth $200,000.
- I know.

19:09.806 --> 19:12.726
Don't think for a moment
you won't die if I don't get it.

19:12.809 --> 19:14.811
You can't mess with Arnie Lippincott...

19:14.895 --> 19:17.689
my boys will be all over you
like green on grass.

19:18.732 --> 19:19.983
How colorful.

19:21.151 --> 19:25.280
But we both know, your midnight
auto supply is a one-man operation.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.033
No, with his chick it makes two.

19:28.408 --> 19:30.744
And she's not going to miss you.

19:31.453 --> 19:35.331
Okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

19:36.416 --> 19:38.460
I'm going to make you a deal.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.338
You are going to make me a deal?

19:42.422 --> 19:43.423
Right...

19:43.673 --> 19:46.301
Excuse me, this happens all the time.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.760
I got it.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.642
Is this, by any chance, part of your deal?

19:55.184 --> 19:56.978
A Packard insignia. So what?

19:57.061 --> 19:58.688
So, I just happen to have a line on...

19:58.771 --> 20:02.525
a 1937 Packard,
12-cylinder Roadster Coupe.

20:04.235 --> 20:06.362
- And?
- And it's yours.

20:06.821 --> 20:10.158
If you two guys
will let me out of here alive...

20:10.241 --> 20:11.909
and in one piece.

20:13.578 --> 20:16.497
Not particularly interested, Mr. Lippincott.

20:17.957 --> 20:20.460
But, by some strange some coincidence...

20:20.543 --> 20:24.338
I do have a buyer
for a 1929 Mercedes Phaeton.

20:24.839 --> 20:27.174
Totally restored and original.

20:27.633 --> 20:31.012
Well, if anybody in this world
can find one...

20:31.178 --> 20:33.347
- it's Arnie Lippincott.
- He's full of it.

20:33.431 --> 20:35.683
Why don't you let me waste him?

20:35.975 --> 20:38.394
By this weekend, Arnie Lippincott.

20:39.645 --> 20:42.231
For 20%, whatever your name is.

20:44.358 --> 20:46.694
A capitalist after my own heart.

20:46.777 --> 20:48.571
- Twenty percent it is.
- Done.

20:48.654 --> 20:50.281
And my insignia?

20:51.198 --> 20:53.075
- Of course.
- Thank you.

20:57.371 --> 20:59.874
I wouldn't give him 20% of nothing.

21:00.124 --> 21:02.084
I'd make him 100% dead.

21:04.712 --> 21:08.841
If he can do as he says,
I can use him in the organization, Alfie.

21:08.924 --> 21:12.386
After all, you haven't come across
with much recently.

21:13.304 --> 21:17.683
However, until he passes this little test...

21:18.100 --> 21:20.561
he's still on the expendable list.

21:27.401 --> 21:30.404
You better get 100% on this test, kid.

21:38.245 --> 21:42.082
Alfie, don't you think it's about time
we took this blindfold off?

21:42.165 --> 21:44.793
It might look a little less conspicuous.

21:44.877 --> 21:47.421
- Yeah, go ahead, take it off.
- All right.

21:50.424 --> 21:53.260
- You look better with it on.
- You're cute.

21:57.472 --> 21:59.182
What's the matter?

22:00.976 --> 22:03.729
I forgot to tell you, this car is hot.

22:03.854 --> 22:05.147
Terrific.

22:06.231 --> 22:08.692
Don't worry, nobody catches Alfie.

22:53.862 --> 22:55.989
- Put up the windows.
- Are you out of your mind?

22:56.072 --> 22:57.407
Put them up.

23:12.005 --> 23:13.339
- Get out!
- Get lost!

23:13.423 --> 23:16.426
Either get wet or get a bullet
through that fancy shirt of yours.

23:16.509 --> 23:18.511
Since you put it that way.

23:22.598 --> 23:24.600
- Come on.
- What about the car?

23:24.684 --> 23:26.853
- Let them have it!
- You are out of your mind!

23:26.936 --> 23:28.563
Let them have it.

23:41.701 --> 23:44.370
- It's the cops.
- Just act natural.

23:44.495 --> 23:46.914
Easy for you to say.
You're used to being all wet.

23:46.998 --> 23:49.542
I'm going home, get some dry clothes.

24:42.386 --> 24:43.554
Hello.

24:44.972 --> 24:48.433
- What hit you, a tidal wave?
- Would you believe a car wash?

24:48.517 --> 24:50.978
It looks like you went through it
without a car.

24:51.061 --> 24:53.146
- I did.
- Why?

24:53.814 --> 24:56.817
- Because it was hot.
- The car wash?

24:56.900 --> 24:59.861
- No, the car.
- Right.

25:00.988 --> 25:04.616
- Did you get photographs?
- Yes, got some pictures.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.285
Just open your palm.

25:08.286 --> 25:11.832
- And do we have a tape recording?
- That's in this pocket.

25:14.209 --> 25:16.211
Lift that cylinder off.

25:16.545 --> 25:18.046
There you are.

25:21.466 --> 25:24.135
Did you by chance get any fingerprints?

25:24.261 --> 25:27.305
Even got those. They may be a bit damp...

25:27.389 --> 25:29.641
but with the waterproof
protective coating...

25:29.724 --> 25:32.227
there shouldn't be too many smudges.

25:33.395 --> 25:35.814
Great, pretty soon we will know
who your man is.

25:35.897 --> 25:39.734
And with any good fortune
we will also have your lady for you.

25:40.110 --> 25:41.986
Who could ask for more?

25:42.070 --> 25:43.905
- Just one thing.
- What?

25:44.322 --> 25:47.492
The car that is described
on that tape recording.

25:48.243 --> 25:50.078
Well, we'll work on it.

25:58.336 --> 26:01.172
It may be a good idea
if you went down by yourself first.

26:01.256 --> 26:03.800
I got a shadow
lurking around here somewhere...

26:03.883 --> 26:06.886
it wouldn't be a good idea
for him to see us together.

26:23.694 --> 26:26.114
Your shadow is here, cop.

26:26.489 --> 26:28.699
Alfie's going to want to talk to you
real bad.

26:28.783 --> 26:31.202
Let's go. Slow.

26:53.099 --> 26:54.225
Help!

27:04.652 --> 27:07.196
Where you going? Somebody, help!

27:50.906 --> 27:52.699
"Interfering females"?

28:00.916 --> 28:02.918
Look after him, will you?

28:10.384 --> 28:13.303
You're the wizard who gives
flying lessons without a plane?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.931
Under the spell of my lasso
you have to tell the truth.

28:16.014 --> 28:17.641
- Who are you?
- Who is your boss?

28:17.724 --> 28:20.560
- Who are you working for?
- Alfie's my boss.

28:20.644 --> 28:21.937
He owns the car wash.

28:22.020 --> 28:24.773
What does this Alfie do with stolen cars?

28:25.273 --> 28:27.984
I don't know nothing about stolen cars.
I'm just a cashier.

28:28.068 --> 28:30.987
When I release you, you will forget
everything that's happened.

28:34.115 --> 28:35.325
You blew it.

28:35.408 --> 28:37.702
I couldn't help it! He gave me the slip.

28:37.786 --> 28:40.288
I'm just a cashier, man.

28:40.372 --> 28:43.083
Yeah. Where have you been all this time?

28:43.500 --> 28:46.086
- I don't know.
- Never mind, his car is here.

28:46.336 --> 28:47.629
He'll be back.

28:47.712 --> 28:50.340
Slim, you got that thing ready for him?

28:52.008 --> 28:54.010
Yeah, it's going to be ready.

28:57.764 --> 29:01.810
I don't think Lippincott is going to
cut into my territory anymore.

29:08.441 --> 29:10.610
But, by some strange coincidence...

29:11.027 --> 29:14.697
I do have a buyer
for a 1929 Mercedes Phaeton.

29:15.490 --> 29:17.700
Totally restored and original.

29:21.537 --> 29:24.540
The I.R.A. C computer
has analyzed the fingerprints.

29:29.379 --> 29:33.382
- Have you got an ID yet, Ira?
- Patience, Steve Trevor.

29:33.466 --> 29:34.634
"Patience, Steve Trevor. "

29:42.016 --> 29:43.684
How is it coming?

29:45.478 --> 29:47.730
When do you want it to go off?

29:47.813 --> 29:50.983
- When Lippincott's in the car.
- I know that, Alfie.

29:51.275 --> 29:55.237
This is a heat-activating timer.
It's used by all the big-time hit men.

29:55.321 --> 29:57.198
Say the temperature in the engine...

29:57.281 --> 30:00.326
runs at a 180 degrees
for 10 minutes, then...

30:00.409 --> 30:01.452
blooey.

30:02.203 --> 30:05.539
Ten minutes sounds good,
as long as it goes blooey.

30:06.123 --> 30:08.000
Don't worry about blooey.

30:11.962 --> 30:16.050
Suspect is Fiskle, Otis B.
Businessman, investor.

30:16.133 --> 30:17.801
Speculator, swindler.

30:17.927 --> 30:21.096
He has amassed two separate fortunes
With illegal schemes...

30:21.180 --> 30:24.516
and subsequently lost them
in legitimate enterprises.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.603
Sounds like he's working
on his third fortune in stolen cars.

30:27.686 --> 30:28.771
Where can we find him?

30:28.854 --> 30:31.357
Also convicted
of swindling pension money...

30:31.440 --> 30:33.942
from retired citizens in nursing homes.

30:34.026 --> 30:35.736
Real nice guy, but where is he?

30:35.819 --> 30:38.572
His record gets increasingly despicable.

30:38.739 --> 30:41.575
Ira, why do I get the impression
you're stalling?

30:41.658 --> 30:43.869
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

30:44.161 --> 30:45.788
Now where is Otis Fiskle?

30:45.871 --> 30:49.124
He always hides his operations
in unexpected places.

30:49.208 --> 30:51.960
If you don't know where he is,
why don't you just admit it?

30:52.044 --> 30:55.589
The I.R.A. C computer is unaccustomed
to admitting failure.

30:57.132 --> 30:59.593
Well, you still have a chance
to redeem yourself.

30:59.676 --> 31:02.596
Have you located the 1929 Phaeton
described on the tape?

31:02.679 --> 31:03.680
Affirmative.

31:03.764 --> 31:06.808
There. You see?
You're still good for something.

31:07.267 --> 31:08.477
All right, let me have it.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.979
The sooner Inspector Bolt
gets that car from Fiskle...

31:11.063 --> 31:13.148
the sooner he can get us
to that hood ornament.

31:24.576 --> 31:26.620
Just admiring your wheels.

31:27.704 --> 31:30.832
What are you doing, Alfie,
looking for a new job?

31:31.625 --> 31:33.084
By the way...

31:33.752 --> 31:37.005
what happened to that shadow of yours?
You lose him, too?

31:37.088 --> 31:39.341
You're real cute, Lippincott.

31:39.841 --> 31:42.093
Where's the M' Sedan
you promised me?

31:43.595 --> 31:45.680
- You mean you got it?
- Of course.

31:46.097 --> 31:48.683
- Well, where is it?
- I'm going to tell you?

31:48.767 --> 31:52.354
You think you're going to swipe that car
to get in good with the Man?

31:52.437 --> 31:54.522
Just doing what the Man tells me.

31:54.856 --> 31:57.358
No matter, the car is mine.

31:57.859 --> 31:59.152
Says who?

32:00.195 --> 32:02.113
Look over there, turkey.

32:06.951 --> 32:08.328
Says him.

32:10.330 --> 32:13.208
Now tell me all about my new car.

32:20.965 --> 32:22.884
- You got the keys.
- Yes.

32:23.259 --> 32:26.012
What a way to spend a Sunday morning.

32:26.429 --> 32:30.308
Mr. Chatsworth wasn't keen on the idea
of letting us pretend to steal his car.

32:30.391 --> 32:32.101
So, if anything happens to it...

32:32.185 --> 32:36.064
he'll have my head, neck, arms,
and possibly my firstborn child.

32:36.147 --> 32:39.025
Those are going to make this
the easiest car theft in history.

32:39.108 --> 32:40.651
What did Inspector Bolt have to say?

32:40.735 --> 32:43.321
I couldn't get a hold of him.
I thought he would be here.

32:44.614 --> 32:45.865
What do you mean "Uh-oh"?

32:45.948 --> 32:48.701
He may be taking matters
into his own hands.

32:48.784 --> 32:51.287
You mean he's hotwiring
Mr. Chatsworth's car?

32:51.370 --> 32:55.249
He said he'd do it, if we didn't get the
keys to him by the time he needed them.

32:55.333 --> 32:58.461
I better get to that antique car
with these before he does.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.797
Or else Mr. Chatsworth is going to be
very unhappy.

33:03.758 --> 33:05.593
To say nothing of me.

33:19.940 --> 33:23.611
I've got the best idea
since women's suffrage.

33:23.903 --> 33:25.779
Why not use the keys?

33:29.575 --> 33:30.910
Surprise.

33:32.202 --> 33:34.330
You expecting someone else?

33:41.337 --> 33:42.713
That's a good girl.

33:56.059 --> 33:57.811
What happened to Lippincott?

33:57.895 --> 33:59.354
He got all tied up.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.148
Why are you tying me up?

34:01.231 --> 34:02.941
Because I don't want him to get lonely.

34:03.025 --> 34:05.694
- Where are you taking me?
- Out to lunch.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.154
So get in.

34:10.991 --> 34:13.201
Lou, get down here, I may need your help.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.328
Diana's in trouble.

34:33.263 --> 34:35.724
We've stopped somewhere,
I can't tell where.

35:00.915 --> 35:02.208
We're in a car wash...

35:02.292 --> 35:04.544
but we seemed to be going down
in an elevator.

35:04.627 --> 35:06.838
Get a hold of Inspector Bolt's
Detail Command.

35:06.921 --> 35:09.549
There's got to be a way to reach him.

35:43.416 --> 35:46.419
Boss? Alfie. I got the car you wanted.

35:48.713 --> 35:51.340
About this guy Lippincott, he's useless.

35:52.091 --> 35:53.843
Had to do it myself.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.345
Okay.

36:04.770 --> 36:06.272
Trevor calling Lippincott.

36:06.939 --> 36:09.275
Trevor calling Arnie Lippincott.

36:11.569 --> 36:14.488
I'm getting numb, Shadow,
why don't you untie me?

36:15.448 --> 36:18.367
Not until Alfie gets back
with the special Phaeton.

36:22.163 --> 36:23.622
Then king me.

36:27.084 --> 36:28.294
Shut up.

36:31.130 --> 36:34.800
Arnie Lippincott, where are you?
Do you read me?

36:34.884 --> 36:37.970
- What's that?
- Come in, Arnie.

36:39.305 --> 36:41.849
Urgent message for Arnie Lippincott.

36:42.433 --> 36:45.060
Lippincott, come in, please. Over.

36:46.312 --> 36:47.563
Shadow.

36:52.109 --> 36:54.403
I guess it looks like you better do...

36:54.820 --> 36:56.321
exactly what I tell you to.

36:57.406 --> 37:01.827
You've got enough classics here
to start your own auto show.

37:02.661 --> 37:07.082
That's a familiar looking Rolls.
1935 Laundalet?

37:07.583 --> 37:10.002
You ought to be a used-car salesman.

37:10.502 --> 37:13.505
Cute. What happened
to the hood ornament?

37:14.506 --> 37:16.258
Boy, you're a nosey broad.

37:17.467 --> 37:20.304
But if you must know,
the boss took it for a souvenir.

37:20.387 --> 37:22.806
- Terrific.
- How nice.

37:23.557 --> 37:26.601
Trevor? This is Lippincott calling, come in.

37:30.522 --> 37:33.567
- Lippincott?
- Yes, Colonel, I'm still here.

37:33.692 --> 37:36.069
That last idea of yours, how good was it?

37:36.153 --> 37:38.655
Best idea since Hannibal crossed the Alps.

37:38.905 --> 37:40.991
- Brilliant?
- But risky.

37:41.575 --> 37:44.619
It is you! Listen. They've got Diana.

37:44.703 --> 37:46.621
- Where?
- I don't know.

37:46.705 --> 37:49.374
She says she's somewhere in a garage
full of classic cars.

37:49.457 --> 37:52.502
Under a car wash.
You have any idea where that might be?

37:52.586 --> 37:55.130
No, I don't. But, wait a minute.

37:55.922 --> 37:59.718
Wait a minute, it's a long shot but
I'd like to try Alfie's car wash, anyway.

37:59.801 --> 38:04.764
I suggest you get a few men down to the
garage and body shop on Grafton Avenue.

38:05.557 --> 38:09.185
- Grafton. I'll be there.
- I'll check with you later. Out.

38:17.527 --> 38:19.362
Don't go away, Shadow.

39:04.991 --> 39:07.827
Inspector? Bolt?

39:08.828 --> 39:10.204
Yes, Colonel, I'm still here.

39:10.288 --> 39:14.083
Diana indicated she's been transferred
to a green four-door Sedan?

39:14.834 --> 39:16.585
A green machine, got it.

39:20.506 --> 39:23.342
Matter of fact,
there's one coming in right now.

39:23.759 --> 39:26.178
I'll keep an eye on him
and move when they do.

39:26.262 --> 39:29.265
Let's hit the road.
We'll monitor on the way.

39:58.335 --> 40:01.171
Help! Help, somebody.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.430
Nobody answers at the garage.

40:10.514 --> 40:13.392
I got a bad feeling
about that guy Lippincott.

40:13.475 --> 40:15.227
Yeah. Like cop fever.

40:15.894 --> 40:17.854
I wonder who he really is.

40:18.021 --> 40:21.400
Doesn't matter,
he ain't going to cause us any trouble.

40:21.483 --> 40:22.734
Yeah, why?

40:22.818 --> 40:25.279
Because if he's running in that car of his.

40:25.737 --> 40:27.447
Blooey. Remember?

40:29.491 --> 40:31.076
You're strange.

41:27.882 --> 41:31.636
Do you hear that, lady?
Your boyfriend's going blooey.

41:32.679 --> 41:33.888
"Blooey"?

41:34.889 --> 41:36.015
A bomb.

41:36.808 --> 41:40.228
Inspector Bolt, this is Trevor.
There may be a bomb in your car.

41:40.311 --> 41:42.772
Repeat, a bomb!
Get out immediately. Over.

41:45.441 --> 41:47.360
Bolt, bail out now.

41:47.902 --> 41:50.279
Sorry, Colonel, I haven't got a parachute.

41:50.363 --> 41:51.739
That's an order!

41:51.948 --> 41:54.992
Not till I find out
where they're taking her.

41:56.619 --> 41:57.829
Out.

42:47.378 --> 42:49.588
- Fiskle?
- That's correct.

42:50.422 --> 42:53.175
I found the hideout.
It's a farm on Oak Creek...

42:53.384 --> 42:55.636
about four miles east of County Line Road.

42:55.719 --> 42:57.554
Bolt, are you out of that car yet?

42:57.638 --> 43:01.183
I'm getting out right now.
I'm going to follow them on foot. Out.

43:14.822 --> 43:15.823
Blooey!

43:17.449 --> 43:19.785
Bring her over here. Quickly.

43:22.913 --> 43:24.748
Take the top off this thing.

43:26.041 --> 43:29.419
Maybe you got rid of my partner...

43:29.503 --> 43:30.837
but that won't stop the others.

45:00.843 --> 45:01.969
Will you take it easy?

45:05.306 --> 45:08.935
Hold it! That's about enough
horsing around. Lou?

45:50.351 --> 45:52.895
Here's another one to add
to your collection, Colonel.

45:52.978 --> 45:54.104
Meet the Man.

45:54.188 --> 45:57.399
Nice work, Bolt.
All right, Fiskle, where is Diana Prince?

45:57.483 --> 45:59.068
She's right here.

45:59.902 --> 46:01.403
Alive and well.

46:02.071 --> 46:05.157
Which is more than I can say
for some people.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.826
Find another car wash, Inspector Bolt?

46:07.910 --> 46:11.955
- Won't have to take a bath for a month.
- But you got your man.

46:12.581 --> 46:14.249
Yes. I did that.

46:15.375 --> 46:17.252
Now maybe we can find your lady.

46:17.795 --> 46:21.131
There's a button on the bottom edge
of that picture frame.

46:33.393 --> 46:35.604
- There's your lady.
- Yep.

46:38.815 --> 46:40.651
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

46:48.075 --> 46:50.452
The E-COM-PHAZE missile plans.

46:50.535 --> 46:55.123
Touted by military intelligence as being
the most deadly system yet conceived.

46:56.416 --> 46:59.794
Now we can go forward
with a defense system to neutralize it.

47:00.212 --> 47:02.214
Yeah. Thanks to you two.

47:02.297 --> 47:06.468
That's us. The best team
since Mickey and Minnie.

47:06.718 --> 47:09.346
- That good?
- The best.

47:46.966 --> 47:48.009
