00:18.976 --> 00:20.603
Stolen secrets!

00:20.645 --> 00:24.649
Villainous mercenary Cad Bane
was hired by Darth Sidious

00:24.774 --> 00:28.319
to steal a holocron
from the vaults of the Jedi Temple.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.405
After fleeing the scene of the crime,

00:30.488 --> 00:33.574
Bane hunted down
and captured Master Bolla Ropal,

00:33.658 --> 00:37.328
who has a crystal which holds secrets
of the Jedi Order.

00:38.579 --> 00:41.332
As a Separatist fleet arrives
to help the bounty hunter,

00:41.457 --> 00:44.335
Anakin Skywalker races in
to cut off their escape

00:44.460 --> 00:47.839
and stop Bane
from delivering the stolen holocron.

00:50.091 --> 00:53.177
- I guess we're going down with the ship.
- Roger, roger.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.684
General, we're receiving
an urgent transmission from the planet.

01:06.065 --> 01:09.026
General Skywalker,
our base has been overrun!

01:09.152 --> 01:10.862
There's no possibility of evacuation!

01:12.238 --> 01:14.598
They've taken General Ropal
and the holocron memory crystal.

01:16.492 --> 01:18.536
Do you know where they've taken them?

01:18.661 --> 01:22.540
Sorry, sir. We tried to stop them,
but they left the outpost.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.044
Wait a second.
There's too much interference.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.547
Transmitter's been destroyed
at the source, sir.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.049
We have to find out
what ship Master Ropal is on.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.407
You will remain conscious, Master Jedi.

01:56.532 --> 01:59.619
The bounty hunter
has some questions for you.

01:59.744 --> 02:04.457
Attach mind limiters, pain pulsers
and give him a full dose of X-C33.

02:11.380 --> 02:15.968
Sir, that Republic ship has destroyed
our escort and is blocking our escape.

02:16.093 --> 02:18.638
Whoever's commanding that cruiser
is a bold one.

02:18.763 --> 02:22.433
Move us out of the battle zone
and prepare to jump to hyperspace.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.061
I have a small favor to ask our Jedi guest.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.069
General, a Separatist command ship
is fleeing the battle.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.949
You think they have Master Ropal
on board as a prisoner?

02:37.990 --> 02:39.283
I'm sure of it.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.370
Admiral, intercept them
before they can jump to hyperspace.

02:42.453 --> 02:46.332
- I'll ready the troops for boarding.
- Boarding? We have no boarding craft.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.544
We were prepared to land on the planet,
not aboard another ship.

02:49.627 --> 02:53.673
- You can't be serious.
- I am, Admiral. Thank you for your opinion.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.238
Now, target their hyperdrive.
We don't want them getting away.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.814
Sir! Captain!

03:09.897 --> 03:13.943
Sir, they hit the power converters
so we can't go into hyperspace.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.487
Hmm. I wonder what the Jedi are planning.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.243
I've rounded up three brigades, sir.
Where are we going?

03:22.326 --> 03:24.579
We're going to board a Separatist frigate,

03:24.662 --> 03:27.832
rescue Master Ropal
and recover an archive holocron.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.878
We have no assault craft, sir.
Only a couple of fighters and The Twilight.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.881
Waiting for orders, sir.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.924
And the plan is?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.551
Just curious.

03:42.513 --> 03:46.851
I came down to see if I could be
of any help, General Skywalker.

03:46.934 --> 03:50.354
Actually, you can.
Activate those walkers, Admiral.

03:52.523 --> 03:56.527
You are not thinking of using those
to transport the clones to that frigate.

03:56.611 --> 04:02.033
- Well, they are pressurized.
- And they're equipped with magnetic feet.

04:02.074 --> 04:06.704
- Hmm. Good call.
- Master, you're a genius.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.540
Those walkers are designed for terrain,
not space.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.793
Rex, load them up. Let's go, Snips.

04:12.877 --> 04:18.882
Execute Battalion, take AT-AT 300!
Carnivore Battalion, Walker 773! Let's go!

04:26.599 --> 04:29.518
Simply open this little box of yours,

04:29.602 --> 04:32.229
so I can get the information
from this crystal,

04:32.313 --> 04:34.899
and your suffering will come to an end.

04:34.982 --> 04:41.864
You will never get me
to unlock the holocron.

04:42.198 --> 04:45.785
Unfortunately, I don't have time
to discuss this with you.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.995
Hit him again, full power.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.543
I'm not sure
how much more of this he can take.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.880
- Are you a medical droid?
- No, sir.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.841
- Then step back and shut up.
- Roger, roger.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.385
More power.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.607
- We've lost all his vital signs.
- Check.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.196
- He is no longer functioning.
- Drop him.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.622
He's dead.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.709
Looks like we will have to find
another Jedi to open this holocron.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.878
Only next time,
I will try a different method.

06:08.325 --> 06:11.495
When Darth Sidious asked me
to loan you the Federation fleet,

06:11.537 --> 06:13.914
he didn't say you were going to war!

06:13.998 --> 06:17.501
Bane, you have already lost
four of my ships.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.754
I hope you can pay for all of this.

06:20.713 --> 06:24.550
One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal I was after.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.427
When my benefactor gets this,

06:26.510 --> 06:29.555
he will compensate you
for your puny fleet.

06:31.932 --> 06:34.185
Sounds like the Jedi want it back.

06:54.538 --> 06:57.041
The Jedi are overwhelming
our vulture droids.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.877
- Should we send out reinforcements?
- No.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.421
- What are you doing?
- Did you say, "No"?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.799
- Mmm-hmm.
- Roger, roger.

07:05.049 --> 07:08.761
The Jedi will board the ship
and get the holocron back!

07:08.886 --> 07:11.639
Transmit the information
and close the deal immediately!

07:11.722 --> 07:15.893
I can't. Only a Jedi can access the device.

07:15.935 --> 07:20.231
Fortunately, there are two Jedi
on their way to help me.

07:20.272 --> 07:22.900
One more than we need for our purposes.

07:22.983 --> 07:26.821
You'd better live through this.
I want my money, Bane.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.489
You can count on it.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.578
Artoo!

07:42.837 --> 07:46.674
Wipe all the frigate's memory banks
and destroy every record of our mission.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
Initiate the self-destruct sequence.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.595
You, transfer all ship functions
to my wrist com.

07:51.679 --> 07:55.266
I want control of doors,
gravity generators, everything.

07:55.307 --> 07:56.392
Roger, roger.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.644
The rest of you,
stay here and defend the bridge.

07:58.769 --> 08:02.565
We're defending the bridge alone?
Against the Jedi?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.275
I hate this job.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.461
Don't shoot! I'm not the commander.
He's the commander!

08:27.047 --> 08:28.966
Guess I'm the commander now.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.635
Artoo, see if you can find Master Ropal.

08:34.929 --> 08:38.642
One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal I was after.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.645
Oh, no. He has both pieces now.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.190
Rex, send a squad,
lock down the hangar bay

08:44.273 --> 08:47.318
and destroy all the escape pods.
No one gets off this ship!

08:47.401 --> 08:49.153
Yes, sir.

08:49.236 --> 08:52.364
Artoo, you have to find Master Ropal.
Hurry!

08:52.573 --> 08:54.742
What was that?

09:01.832 --> 09:05.502
General Skywalker, one of the engines
on that frigate has exploded.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.838
I caution you to avoid the aft section.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.133
- How much damage is there?
- I suggest immediate evacuation.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.302
Not until we get what we came for.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.264
Spread out. While you take on the clones,

09:17.348 --> 09:20.768
I will separate the Jedi
and lead one of them away.

09:27.816 --> 09:30.110
Master, I found him!

09:33.989 --> 09:37.243
Rex, have some men
take Master Ropal back to the Resolute.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.829
We might not be able to find
the holocron in time, Master.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.750
But if it's destroyed with the ship,
Nute Gunray won't get it either.

09:44.833 --> 09:48.629
Maybe, but I'd rather
return it to the library personally.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.634
Come on, Artoo.

09:54.718 --> 09:58.555
Artoo says we're close. Stay sharp.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.976
Ow!

10:02.309 --> 10:03.394
Switch to night vision.

10:15.572 --> 10:16.740
There!

10:28.752 --> 10:31.088
Welcome, Jedi. We've been expecting you.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.383
Kill them!

10:41.098 --> 10:43.767
Let's make this a bit more interesting.

10:45.644 --> 10:46.979
Lockdown!

10:52.276 --> 10:53.819
Magnetics! You were trained for this!

10:59.867 --> 11:03.037
Artoo, turn the gravity generators
back on!

11:29.271 --> 11:33.108
Check your fire! Hit one of those shells
and this fight is over for all of us!

12:21.365 --> 12:22.783
I'll get him, Master!

12:24.535 --> 12:26.745
Ahsoka, wait! It's a trap!

12:30.082 --> 12:32.459
Ahsoka, wait! We'll take him together!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.386
Whoops!

12:55.566 --> 12:57.109
You thought you could get away?

12:57.234 --> 13:01.280
You're not much of a challenge, youngling.
I got you right where I want you.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.158
Ow!

13:13.250 --> 13:15.002
I'm not impressed.

13:34.771 --> 13:40.277
General Skywalker, can you hear me?
Are you all right in there?

13:40.319 --> 13:43.071
Yeah, I'm all right.
Get back to the hangar.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.908
Find a transport,
but wait for us as long as you can.

13:45.949 --> 13:47.284
We're on it, sir.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.952
Ahsoka, do you copy?

13:59.463 --> 14:01.632
There's a power surge
heading toward the bridge.

14:01.673 --> 14:05.219
If you're there, get out immediately.
You must abandon your mission.

14:05.677 --> 14:08.096
I don't have the holocron memory

14:08.138 --> 14:11.308
and I seem to have misplaced
my Padawan.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.644
The ship is tearing itself apart!

14:13.685 --> 14:17.356
Move off to a safe distance, Admiral,
and await my signal for evacuation.

14:17.981 --> 14:21.693
Of all the Jedi,
why did I have to end up with Skywalker?

14:23.278 --> 14:25.864
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.825
Those binders have been
specially designed for Jedi.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.996
The more you struggle,
the tighter they get.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.667
- Impressed now, youngling?
- Not really.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.803
Enjoy this while you can, sleemo.

14:47.886 --> 14:51.056
This burning boat
is about to finish us both off.

14:51.139 --> 14:52.558
We have time.

14:52.641 --> 14:56.144
The bond between a Jedi teacher
and his apprentice is strong.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.856
Which means my Master
will be coming for me any minute.

15:02.609 --> 15:05.237
Let's see if we can get
him here any faster.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.371
You said we'd be safe back here.

15:14.454 --> 15:17.165
Come on,
there's three of us and only one of him.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.375
It won't matter.

15:20.168 --> 15:24.673
Sir, a Jedi is coming.
He looks very unhappy.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.597
Your Master has gotten the message.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.812
You have nowhere left to run,
bounty hunter.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.232
Let me worry about that, Jedi.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.901
If I activate this control,

15:44.985 --> 15:48.780
the outside airlock will open
and she will be sucked into oblivion.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.633
Do you think you can kill me
and then save her

15:50.657 --> 15:53.076
before she's pulled out into space?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.329
It's a horrible way to die.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.834
Besides, isn't negotiation the Jedi way?

16:04.296 --> 16:05.339
What do you want?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.884
This holocron carries information
I've been paid to collect.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.887
I can't unlock it, but you can.

16:11.970 --> 16:15.390
The last Jedi who had it wouldn't open it.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.060
I hope you don't make the same mistake.

16:21.104 --> 16:25.817
We don't have much time.
Hurry it up, Jedi, or she dies!

16:28.403 --> 16:32.658
- No, Master! Don't do it!
- I can't let you die, Ahsoka.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.409
Master, no!

16:38.789 --> 16:42.125
- We'll deal with the holocron later.
- How touching.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.131
All units make for that shuttle!

17:20.372 --> 17:23.916
Captain, the main reactor is exposed.
It will implode at any moment.

17:25.167 --> 17:28.171
Yes, sir. We're trying to make our way
to the shuttle now.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.507
- Get out of there!
- Sir! Yes, sir.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.342
You two find the General and help him!

17:32.384 --> 17:35.011
This frigate's not going to last.
We have to get out of here!

17:35.053 --> 17:36.179
Yes, sir!

17:38.098 --> 17:41.518
Come about. We need to put some
distance between us and that frigate.

18:04.207 --> 18:06.209
Now I will combine this holocron

18:06.251 --> 18:10.297
with the memory crystal
I acquired from your dead Jedi friend.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.182
My employers will be most pleased.

18:51.254 --> 18:56.301
- Bane, did the Jedi cooperate with you?
- With some encouragement.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.053
I have access to the holocron

18:58.094 --> 19:00.430
and all the information
the memory contains.

19:00.555 --> 19:02.599
I only have to get off this ship.

19:02.641 --> 19:08.438
Maybe you should transmit it to me now.
Then I can send another ship for you.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.651
No thanks, Viceroy.
I have a plan for my own escape.

19:19.616 --> 19:23.495
Hold it right there!
You're not going anywhere, bounty hunter.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.292
Rex, I hope you found us
a ride off this bucket!

19:29.417 --> 19:32.587
We've got to leave now.
The reactor's gonna blow. We cannot wait!

19:32.629 --> 19:35.382
You'll have to.
I'm going after that bounty hunter.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.969
Master, wait! Stop!

19:39.010 --> 19:43.139
This is the way to the hangar!
We must get off the ship now!

19:44.182 --> 19:48.103
- I can't let Bane get away.
- Patience, Master.

19:48.603 --> 19:49.855
Patience.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.524
You're right.

20:17.465 --> 20:19.175
Come on, come on!

20:27.517 --> 20:31.521
- Trooper, did you get the holocron?
- No, sir.

20:31.605 --> 20:35.317
- I'll get it, Master.
- No time. Rex, get us out of here.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.709
Well, it looks like
the holocron was destroyed,

20:52.834 --> 20:55.211
but at least the Separatists didn't get it.

20:56.379 --> 20:59.174
Bane's dead, but I can still feel him.

21:14.397 --> 21:18.902
Master, I'm sorry
I let that mercenary get the upper hand.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.740
It wasn't your fault, Ahsoka.
It was mine, start to finish.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.415
So, did you manage
to recover the holocron

21:32.540 --> 21:34.751
or capture the bounty hunter?

21:35.293 --> 21:37.754
Um, no and no.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.090
