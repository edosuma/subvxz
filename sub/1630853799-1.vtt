PROUD TO BE FROM THE OUTSKIRTS

00:26.583 --> 00:29.041
Livin' uptown
is no picnic, bro.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.041
You may think you know what to expect,

00:31.125 --> 00:33.166
but uptown is like a vintage car,

00:33.250 --> 00:36.791
you never know if it's gonna work.
It's always by chance.

00:38.916 --> 00:41.000
RICHARDSSON
OUR HERO

00:41.083 --> 00:43.666
Here, we have samba circles,
charmin' parties…

00:43.750 --> 00:45.291
Hey, check it. Make it funky.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.666
See you, fam!

00:50.291 --> 00:53.333
Here, we all consider the street
as a part of our home.

00:53.416 --> 00:54.791
Morning! Looking good!

00:54.875 --> 00:57.291
-Hey, better behave, boy.
-Why?

00:57.375 --> 01:00.000
And the best part,
we all take care of each other.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.083
BODY AND SOUL

01:02.166 --> 01:05.875
-Good morning, Pastor!
-Good morning, you cherub of glory!

01:05.958 --> 01:08.208
God is good
all the time, Pastor!

01:08.291 --> 01:09.416
PASTOR JOSIAS
SPIRITUAL LEADER

01:09.500 --> 01:11.958
There are brothers and sisters of Jesus
alongside atheists here.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
We lay offerings on the sidewalks.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.291
Nah.

01:25.291 --> 01:26.458
JURA
UNWORLDLY TRICKSTER

01:26.541 --> 01:29.000
Your life
can change in a second uptown.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.666
Everyone is hustling
to create a better life for themselves.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.791
We have faith that things'll work out…
with a little luck.

01:36.375 --> 01:37.333
Right, Mr. Luís?

01:39.416 --> 01:40.625
MR. LUÍS
THIS IS NOT HIS STORY

01:41.791 --> 01:42.791
Oh, man.

01:43.583 --> 01:46.208
The beauty here
lies between the old and new.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.291
What we want to buy
and what we can afford.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.250
It's not something easy to define.

01:51.333 --> 01:55.500
Our lives are fueled by sweat,
struggling, and natural guaraná.

01:55.583 --> 01:59.416
It's called "natural" because
it's water, sugar, and caramel color.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.083
Mother!
Thising door won't open!

02:15.166 --> 02:17.000
Come on! What the?

02:17.500 --> 02:18.583
Oh, seriously?

02:19.166 --> 02:21.375
You guys decided
to beep all my cursing now?

02:21.458 --> 02:22.916
Well, that!

02:24.083 --> 02:27.875
Yo, Mr. Luís, can you give me a hand,
please, with the door?

02:28.833 --> 02:31.583
Mom told me to fix it, but I forgot.

02:31.666 --> 02:34.750
If she sees this… she'll scold me.

02:34.833 --> 02:36.000
Richardsson!

02:40.458 --> 02:44.583
CRISTINA
OUR HERO'S MOM

02:45.458 --> 02:49.458
How many times
have I told you to fix that door, son?

02:49.541 --> 02:51.916
And look at the marquee!
It could fall and hurt someone.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
SAIGON
BEAUTY SALON

02:53.083 --> 02:54.541
How hard is it to fix it?

02:54.625 --> 02:55.666
Good morning, Mom.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.250
"Good morning, Richardsson, my son."

02:58.333 --> 03:02.000
See? Look. It's open.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.083
Hang on, aren't you
supposed to be in school, mister?

03:05.166 --> 03:07.458
No, Mom. We're just checking our grades.

03:07.541 --> 03:08.916
I even told Raquel.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.291
"Let's leave for school later."
She agreed.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.416
Later when, Richardsson?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.500
Later now, Mom. I was about to go.

03:17.583 --> 03:20.708
You look so beautiful with that…
that bow in your hair, a flower…

03:20.791 --> 03:22.416
Blessings! Bye, Mommy! Love you!

03:22.500 --> 03:23.625
Okay, God bless you.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.333
GREICE KELLY
POOR-MAN'S BEYONCÉ

03:34.041 --> 03:37.500
-Good morning, beloved! You're early!
-Good morning, Greice!

03:37.583 --> 03:40.875
You look so pretty already.
You make my job easier.

03:40.958 --> 03:42.208
Go in, I'll be right with you.

03:42.791 --> 03:45.375
That one
makes a living off of lying to others.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.625
Thank you.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.166
I'll take that one. Mmm-hmm.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.625
Did you pass?

04:09.375 --> 04:11.375
RAQUEL
THE LOVE INTEREST

04:12.458 --> 04:14.375
I passed, Quel. Did you?

04:14.875 --> 04:16.125
I passed in chemistry.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.541
You only passed in chemistry, Quel?

04:18.625 --> 04:21.500
I copied from the right person.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.250
Now that school is over,
what are you gonna do?

04:24.916 --> 04:28.125
-Hmm. Law. Law.
-Law is way too boring.

04:28.208 --> 04:31.500
-Look, a Black dude in a three-piece…
-You're some kinda activist?

04:31.583 --> 04:33.541
You're right. Business school, maybe?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.458
Capitalist scum.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.166
There is no winning with you today, huh?

04:38.250 --> 04:40.083
Keep trying. Who knows?

04:41.083 --> 04:43.458
Uh, yeah, I have to think of a career--

04:43.541 --> 04:48.125
What's up, love? Cheese Curd is here!

04:50.416 --> 04:52.916
CHEESE CURD
THE HEARTTHROB

04:54.250 --> 04:55.750
-Hey, there, Big Head.
-'Sup?

04:55.833 --> 04:58.375
-Did you pass, bro?
-I passed. How 'bout you?

04:58.958 --> 05:00.083
Only in chemistry.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.375
He copied from the person
who copied from the right person.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.875
It's the circle of life, dude.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.791
-Oh, you two are funny.
-Later, man.

05:06.875 --> 05:11.041
I'm off right now to meet Carol and record
MC Cheese Curd's first track. Wanna come?

05:11.125 --> 05:14.958
-Come with us, Richardsson.
-No can do. I gotta help my mom at Saigon.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.916
Ah, no worries. The struggle is real.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.625
-True that. I gotta go help.
-See you later.

05:20.416 --> 05:22.291
-Chow.
-Yeah, for sure, guys.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.375
Later.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.333
What? What are you looking at?

05:32.250 --> 05:33.083
Yeah, right.

05:34.666 --> 05:35.625
Thanks, driver!

05:36.875 --> 05:40.458
Richardsson, tell my why
you look so worried, my son!

05:40.541 --> 05:43.666
Easy now, Pastor. I didn't see you there.
You scared me, man!

05:43.750 --> 05:46.083
Today, I'm a secret agent of Christ.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.208
Really? So you're a spy now, Pastor?

05:48.291 --> 05:51.291
"Don't fear," Richardsson.
So says our merciful Lord.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.208
That's right.

05:52.291 --> 05:55.208
Unless of course you're
hiding some carnality of Jehovah.

05:55.291 --> 05:58.833
-And if that's the case, then do fear.
-No, Pastor. Nothing like that.

05:58.916 --> 06:01.083
I was at school. Guess what?

06:01.166 --> 06:04.458
I passed all my classes
with flying colors!

06:04.541 --> 06:07.250
A huge amen, my son!

06:08.333 --> 06:11.041
Well, son, tell me.
What will you do now? Hmm?

06:11.125 --> 06:15.375
What the-- Everybody's asking me that.
Yo, Pastor, I just finished high school.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.125
Yeah, but you have
to climb the ladder, you know?

06:18.208 --> 06:20.708
Uh, first there's college,
graduating from college,

06:20.791 --> 06:22.833
study medicine, tourism…

06:22.916 --> 06:23.916
Firefighter!

06:24.000 --> 06:27.750
-There are many firefighters at church.
-I hear you. All from Monte de Christo.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.333
Yeah, and now the church
even has celebrities, huh?

06:30.416 --> 06:32.500
-Is that right?
-And we have some soccer players, too.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.458
Yeah, right! Mmm, did they go pro?

06:34.541 --> 06:36.000
-Well, some day.
-Some day.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.583
The boy is not even eight yet.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.791
-And he's in Olaria's youth league.
-I see. Right.

07:04.791 --> 07:11.791
A PIECE OF SAIGON

07:19.333 --> 07:21.708
-Hello, Mother!
-Ahh! Boy, you really scared me!

07:21.791 --> 07:24.083
I was focusing! Out of the way.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.458
Okay, Mom, focusing on what?

07:27.625 --> 07:28.833
We have no clients.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.833
Oh, my baby! You're Mama's little boy,
my cutie pie.

07:33.916 --> 07:36.625
Use those powers of observation
on the college entrance exams.

07:36.708 --> 07:40.458
You'll pass the minute
you enter the exam room.

07:41.166 --> 07:44.583
-I wanted to talk to you about that--
-I don't want to hear it.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.833
Mom, I was just gonna say
that I'm not really sure what career--

07:47.916 --> 07:51.416
Richardsson, I've told you already,
you're going to college

07:51.500 --> 07:54.166
and applying for a public service job,
just like your father.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.083
Yo, Mom, didn't Dad quit his public job

07:57.166 --> 07:59.250
to help you here at Saigon? What if I--

07:59.333 --> 08:02.500
I'm sorry, this is
not something to play with, cutie.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.791
I won't even listen to you,
you're messing with me, all right?

08:06.875 --> 08:09.000
Hello! Saigon. Good morning.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.166
Of course I have a slot for you.
Definitely, dear.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.166
Uh, what treatment do you want? Uh-huh.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.375
Yeah, it's scheduled, darling.
I'll be here.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.291
Oh, thank you, God Almighty.
I have a client.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.875
But she wants to use a curl cauterizer
and I don't have one.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.791
Mom, I'm hungry.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.166
Do I look like a delivery service?

08:33.250 --> 08:34.958
What, Danielle didn't get us some food?

08:35.041 --> 08:38.916
Why is my name comin'
out of your mouth, boy? You little chump.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.125
Nah, Sis, I just said I'm hungry.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.125
-You're being chauvinistic, Richardsson!
-Come on.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.583
Stop it, you two!
Did you bring lunch or not, Danielle?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.041
I got it! Right?

08:48.125 --> 08:51.458
That a girl, Sis! Up top!

08:51.958 --> 08:54.166
You didn't put corn in this, did you?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.375
-Uh, Mom, that corn is transgenic.
-For your sister.

08:56.458 --> 08:57.750
"Transgenic."

08:57.833 --> 09:01.000
Now that she's in college,
all of a sudden she's got a big head.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.750
-Isn't that right, son?
-The pesticides aren't healthy, Mom.

09:03.833 --> 09:04.833
Oh, yeah, totally.

09:04.916 --> 09:08.500
And that thing you puff on
has pesticides and you inhale it?

09:08.583 --> 09:11.791
-There are hormones in that corn.
-Oh, shut up, you master chef!

09:12.958 --> 09:15.291
A friend from college
is coming later to do homework, okay?

09:15.375 --> 09:17.125
-Huh?
-That explains it, Mom.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.666
Disobedience and activism.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.500
-"A friend."
-Cristina!

09:23.291 --> 09:26.083
Oh, my God.
Father in Heaven, this is terrible.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.416
Hi, Jorge.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.416
I could've sworn you
were coming by later today.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.791
JORGE
OUR LANDLORD

09:33.875 --> 09:36.708
We've discussed this, Cristina.
You need to pay your rent.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.708
But what about our deal?

09:38.791 --> 09:42.250
I told you I'd give you partnership
and 30% of my profits.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.875
What, Mom? You two made a deal?

09:45.750 --> 09:48.708
Mom, this is my inheritance.
I should have been consulted.

09:48.791 --> 09:50.458
Us poor don't inherit anything.

09:50.541 --> 09:55.000
-Shut up, Richardsson. Mind your business.
-Cristina, 30% of zero is zero, right?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.458
You're already three months late.

09:57.541 --> 09:58.791
It's in the contract.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.250
You need to pay me one month's rent,
or you're kicked out.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.333
I need your stuff
out of here by tomorrow, all right?

10:04.416 --> 10:05.708
Tomorrow?

10:05.791 --> 10:08.666
I have someone who's interested.
I need to rent the space.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.375
You live off other people's hard work.
That's low.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.958
I'm a righteous man, boy.

10:14.041 --> 10:17.125
Get out of here, Jorge,
before I throw this fork at your head.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.125
Tomorrow, Cristina.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.291
Tomorrow, tomorrow…

10:21.833 --> 10:24.375
Richardsson, did you
have to pick a fight with the man?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.833
Now, we're all screwed!

10:25.916 --> 10:26.750
What? Me?

10:26.833 --> 10:30.125
Didn't you just tell the guy that
you were gonna throw a fork at his head?

10:30.208 --> 10:32.333
You should have, Mom.
You have to fight back!

10:32.416 --> 10:34.708
You'll only have power when you
own the means of production.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.958
Otherwise, he'll dilute
your productive power, Mom.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.541
He's screwin' us.
That's exactly what he's up to.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.791
Check out my plan.
I could help you out around here.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.125
-Let me cut people's hair--
-Don't even start, Richardsson.

10:44.208 --> 10:47.083
For God's sake.
Remember when your father wanted to help.

10:47.166 --> 10:50.291
He left the stability of a public job.
And what happened? He had a heart attack.

10:50.375 --> 10:53.750
But that's not why Dad had a heart attack.
It was his hypertension, Mom.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.416
-It's got nothing to do--
-Richardsson.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.916
-Look, you wanna help?
-Yes, Ma'am.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.125
I want you to go to Mother Andinha.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.166
Mother Andinha?

11:01.250 --> 11:04.625
Mother Andinha will have
the proper guidance for you, son.

11:04.708 --> 11:07.791
Enough! I'm so tired
of everyone telling me what to do, Mom.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.666
Richardsson, when you
come back from Mother Andinha's house,

11:12.500 --> 11:16.541
go to Greice Kelly's and borrow
some of her curl cauterizer fo me, okay?

11:16.625 --> 11:19.416
-Okay, Mom. I'll go, Mom.
-Go, Richardsson, please. Go.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.708
Why are you still here?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.083
-All right, I'm goin' now.
-Go, son.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.041
-Love you, Mom.
-I love you too, honey.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.916
-Bless you.
-Bless you.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.541
So, first to Mother Andinha's.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.250
-Then after that…
-What's up, Richardsson?

11:33.833 --> 11:35.458
-What's up, Johnny?
-Tough stuff.

11:35.541 --> 11:36.875
What now? What are you on about?

11:36.958 --> 11:39.625
Besides, don't you have power to steal?

11:39.708 --> 11:42.791
Hey, look, now there's a job for you.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.500
The grid's down, right?

11:44.583 --> 11:48.000
I could fix that, but I'd rather
make you a proposal instead.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.500
Easy money.
You just have to use your talent.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.166
Are you in?

11:53.750 --> 11:56.250
Mind your own business! This is private.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.875
Go back to your gambling.

11:57.958 --> 12:01.708
Yeah, so, Johnny, that easy money thing…

12:01.791 --> 12:04.458
You're pullin' my leg, man.
It doesn't exist.

12:04.541 --> 12:05.458
Hold on a sec.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.666
Hi, Raquel. Now?

12:07.750 --> 12:09.916
You're busy working for me, tell her that.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.625
No such thing. By the way,
I have a previous engagement, Raquel.

12:12.708 --> 12:15.000
-Come again?
-You wanna join me?

12:15.083 --> 12:17.458
-Sounds good! Bye!
-We're in the middle of talking business--

12:17.541 --> 12:20.416
I won! 14-12.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.791
First drawing?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.750
-You practice Santeria?
-Me? Santeria?

12:24.833 --> 12:28.250
No, I don't do no Santeria.
And you can't say "Santeria."

12:28.333 --> 12:30.500
Only those who
practice can say "Santeria."

12:30.583 --> 12:33.500
-Otherwise, it's derogatory.
-Ah! So you don't do it?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.791
No, I don't. But my mom does.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.125
She got married here.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.541
-What's your faith?
-Me?

12:39.625 --> 12:41.750
-Yeah.
-I'm a historical materialist!

12:43.541 --> 12:45.375
Shut up! You don't even know what that is!

12:46.125 --> 12:49.500
My son! Where's your mother?

12:49.583 --> 12:52.791
-You're blessing, Mother Andinha.
-May Obatala bless you, my son.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.583
My mom didn't come this time.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.791
-This is Raquel.
-Hi, there.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.250
Hmm. What a beautiful lady.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.750
You want a wedding ceremony?

13:01.625 --> 13:02.583
Ceremony?

13:02.666 --> 13:05.541
No, Mother Andinha.
Raquel is just a friend.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.041
Mmm-hmm.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.666
I know your mother's life is hectic.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.250
But she needs to come by more often.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.708
Well, Saigon's going bankrupt,
Mother Andinha.

13:15.791 --> 13:18.750
You've got to have faith, my son,
in her and in yourself.

13:19.791 --> 13:23.625
Knowledge without wisdom
is like water poured on sand, my son.

13:25.916 --> 13:28.666
Oshun is replying to us.

13:30.666 --> 13:33.125
Your ancestor is worried about you.

13:33.208 --> 13:36.250
He blames himself
for having left you so early.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.041
He just wanted to see you do well.

13:40.541 --> 13:42.750
Are you talking about my Dad,
Mother Andinha?

13:53.250 --> 13:56.333
-You wanna use the razor?
-The clippers, please. It's safer, Dad.

13:56.416 --> 13:59.833
Hey, are you scared? Damn.

14:00.958 --> 14:01.875
Trust your Daddy, son.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.541
Be brave, Richardsson.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.000
Own up to what you are.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.000
Find your place in the world.

14:11.125 --> 14:15.000
No man strays too far
from where the corn is roasting.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.250
A chicken!

14:26.666 --> 14:29.541
I don't think I get it.
Uh, can you explain, please?

14:29.625 --> 14:30.750
Come on, Richardsson.

14:30.833 --> 14:32.791
Has your mother taught you nothing?

14:33.625 --> 14:34.916
You should do as I say.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.166
Buy a chicken
and it will show you the way.

14:38.250 --> 14:41.458
But, Mother Andinha,
I don't have the money to buy a chicken.

14:41.541 --> 14:42.791
Do not fret, my son.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.875
I have a few chores
you can do for me here,

14:45.958 --> 14:47.791
and you can make a little money.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.208
Remember, child,

14:49.708 --> 14:52.625
a tree which bends itself

14:53.916 --> 14:55.333
is not broken by the wind.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.500
Cristina!

14:59.583 --> 15:03.458
Ah, you scared me, Sardine!
You know I hate being scared.

15:03.541 --> 15:06.875
I can't help it. I hope you're
not scared of my love for you, hon.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.583
Enough small talk, Sardine.
I have work to do, all right?

15:12.666 --> 15:15.833
I heard that you just applied for
a loan over at the bank. Ain't that right?

15:15.916 --> 15:20.625
-Hang on! Are you spying on me, Sardine?
-Not at all, brown sugar.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.166
What I'm saying here
is that over at the bank,

15:23.250 --> 15:26.541
they have a lot of demands
and ask for many guarantees.

15:26.625 --> 15:30.416
While me, I only want
one guarantee, one thing.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.875
-I just want you back, my brown sugar--
-Hey!

15:33.958 --> 15:37.333
Stop with the funny business!
Listen to me closely, okay, Sardine?

15:37.416 --> 15:39.333
Please stop trying to relive our past!

15:39.416 --> 15:42.125
You know it too,
that relationship was a long time ago.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.041
It's history.
We dated, but it was in school.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.875
We were just kids. Enough, already.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.208
Aren't you gonna tell me
what the priestess told you?

15:56.875 --> 15:58.416
It was no big deal, Raquel.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.916
-She told me to buy a chicken, that's all.
-That's all, Richardsson?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.666
-She said more.
-What do you mean?

16:05.041 --> 16:07.958
-Were you eavesdropping?
-No! Of course not!

16:08.041 --> 16:11.166
-Yes, you were!
-All right, I heard a little bit.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.458
That's invasion of privacy, Quel.

16:13.541 --> 16:16.458
What privacy, Richardsson?
That isn't even a thing anymore.

16:16.541 --> 16:19.375
Also, she was speaking in code.
"Corn?" Man, what's that?

16:19.875 --> 16:23.708
I didn't get it either.
But I'm focused on buying a chicken.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.750
That corn thing is interesting.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.500
It's about us
being connected to our origins.

16:28.583 --> 16:29.625
Uh-huh?

16:30.708 --> 16:33.375
So you're a specialist
in spiritual consultation?

16:33.458 --> 16:36.125
"A tree which
bends itself is not broken by the wind."

16:36.208 --> 16:37.250
I like that one.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.458
Since you find it so interesting,
solve it for me, philosopher.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.500
Ah, she was telling you to be flexible,

16:42.583 --> 16:45.583
not to be stuck to rules
and patterns about anything.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.416
Life choices, relationships.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.791
-Maybe hooking up with other people…
-Hooking up?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.166
I don't remember
Mother Andinha saying that.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.083
Oh, come on.

16:58.916 --> 17:01.166
Check it out! This one likes you!

17:01.916 --> 17:02.958
Don't be a jerk.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.875
Now, what? How do you choose?

17:07.083 --> 17:08.583
How the hell would I know?

17:09.416 --> 17:11.833
-I have past trauma.
-Richardsson, go.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.083
Hurry, Richardsson.

17:14.166 --> 17:18.166
One time, I was playing
in my own world, like kids do.

17:18.250 --> 17:22.583
The next thing I know, I looked at my dad.
He was sharpening a knife.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.875
And I thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna free that chicken."

17:26.958 --> 17:28.458
I said, "Fly chicken!"

17:28.541 --> 17:30.791
Fly away!

17:30.875 --> 17:32.833
And I threw her
over the fence!

17:32.916 --> 17:35.625
That's when I learned
that chickens don't fly.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.166
Since then, taking care
of an animal scares the hell out of me.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.375
I think you made a good choice, Big Head.

17:45.458 --> 17:46.291
PENHA HENS

17:46.375 --> 17:47.208
What is this?

17:47.291 --> 17:49.625
-Suddenly you're a chicken expert now?
-Yeah.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.375
CHEESE CURD
Artist's block, SOS

17:54.458 --> 17:57.583
Oh, Cheese Curd. He has writer's block.
He's such an artist.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.541
Go help him! It's okay, really.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.458
-No worries.
-No, relax. Don't screw it up.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.083
Shouldn't you be more positive, Raquel?

18:04.625 --> 18:05.833
Say it'll be all right.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.958
Ah, but that's not up to me right now.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.541
Take care, boy.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.083
Your name will be "Feathers."

18:18.833 --> 18:22.041
And your mission is to
show me my place in the world, all right?

18:22.541 --> 18:23.833
Quite the responsibility.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.500
So tell me, where we goin' now?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.333
That way? Let's go then, Feathers!

18:29.416 --> 18:32.208
People, please! Who's working on her hair?

18:32.291 --> 18:33.625
-Who's doing this one?
-I am.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.333
It's time to wash her hair, okay?

18:36.208 --> 18:37.500
Ms. Espir.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.375
Welcome back!

18:40.458 --> 18:42.833
I'll take care of you today.
Okay, Ms. Espir?

18:42.916 --> 18:44.458
We'll lighten these roots.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.833
When I'm done,
it'll be ready for church on Sunday!

18:47.916 --> 18:51.000
Oh, Glory to God! Glory to God!

18:51.083 --> 18:53.291
Hey, sweetie, look here.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.250
For this queen, let's do this sequence.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.833
One product at a time, in that order.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.750
It'll look amazing.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.708
Jorge!

19:03.500 --> 19:04.583
What is it?

19:04.666 --> 19:08.125
All set for us to seal the deal, Greice.
I talked to Cristina.

19:08.208 --> 19:11.041
-She's gone tomorrow.
-Ah, that's fantastic!

19:11.125 --> 19:13.666
We can inspect the place
whenever you want.

19:13.750 --> 19:17.208
Ah, great! For a minute,
I thought you wanted to be her partner.

19:17.291 --> 19:21.000
I'm a businessman, Greice Kelly.
I go where the money is.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.083
As soon as things cool down here,
we'll go look at it.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.000
Richardsson?

19:25.625 --> 19:27.250
-Are you lost?
-Uh…

19:27.333 --> 19:30.333
-Okay, then. I have to go, Greice.
-Sounds good.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.875
Uh, the roof is leaking.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.208
What are you doing here?

19:35.791 --> 19:37.625
-Hey!
-Nice chicken.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.166
That is so rude of you, Greice Kelly!

19:40.250 --> 19:43.416
I don't mind it,
but Feathers here has quite a pedigree.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.708
How dare you! I'm completely offended!

19:45.791 --> 19:49.166
I deeply regret having come to this place.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.041
But if you insist, I can stay,

19:51.125 --> 19:53.625
because I need
to borrow a curl cauterizer.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.083
Oh, you need to borrow it.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.750
I bet it's your mom
who wants to borrow it, right?

19:58.833 --> 20:01.583
-What difference does it make, Miss Kelly?
-It's different because--

20:01.666 --> 20:02.666
Greice!

20:02.750 --> 20:03.833
Cinara!

20:03.916 --> 20:06.166
-You're early for your appointment.
-Greice.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.166
Look at me.
The fact that I got here is impressive.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.291
-I brought Shantara.
-Ah!

20:11.375 --> 20:12.500
Tell me you can fix her.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.458
And it has to be now.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.000
Honey, our schedule is packed right now.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.333
Alexis, hold Shantara.

20:19.916 --> 20:22.750
Offer her some Champagne,
some water, anything.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.833
-Make yourself at home, dear.
-Yes, ma'am.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.041
-Thank you.
-Don't touch anything, okay?

20:27.541 --> 20:30.083
Don't let that chicken
out of that bag near my salon, got it?

20:30.166 --> 20:33.166
She has a pedigree!
She listens to commands! Watch this.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.791
Stay put, Feathers. You behave…

20:35.875 --> 20:37.416
Hey, you didn't watch.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.833
Grandma? Huh?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.625
My crazy grandson.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.958
What are you doing here, Grandma?

20:45.041 --> 20:48.583
I'm only exercising
my power as a consumer.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.791
This is the free market.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.250
Supply and demand.

20:52.333 --> 20:56.458
And I'll patron any salon parlor I want,
no matter what you say.

20:56.541 --> 20:59.375
Yeah, but that won't stop
my mom from getting heartbroken

20:59.458 --> 21:01.750
when she hears
you're here instead of Saigon.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.875
What about you, Grandson?
What are you doing here?

21:04.958 --> 21:06.875
I came to get some product.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.750
Things at Saigon
aren't the best right now.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.458
Look, I've already told your mother.

21:10.541 --> 21:14.541
Any time she needs,
you can all go live with me.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.458
My house has enough room for everyone.

21:17.541 --> 21:19.541
You think my Mom would agree to that?

21:19.625 --> 21:21.166
Of course not! You know her.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.750
There's a chicken!
Get it out of here! Get it! Get it!

21:23.833 --> 21:26.291
-Somebody get it!
-Stop it! Feathers, what are you doing?

21:29.250 --> 21:31.333
This is the craziest
thing I've seen in my life!

21:31.416 --> 21:33.916
-Come on!
-Here! Here's the bag!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.416
Oh, my God, Feathers!

21:35.500 --> 21:36.875
Get in the bag!

21:36.958 --> 21:37.833
Hold on, get it!

21:40.166 --> 21:41.625
Come here, Feathers.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.333
Look! It's smashing all the products!

21:44.416 --> 21:46.416
Richardsson, come here, please.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.875
-Yo! What is it?
-Come here.

21:52.291 --> 21:53.125
What's up?

21:53.208 --> 21:55.208
Will you watch Vitinho, this cutie here,

21:55.291 --> 21:57.458
so I can make his mother
look even prettier?

21:57.541 --> 22:00.750
Wait, a child? I've already got a chicken.
It's too much for me to handle.

22:00.833 --> 22:01.958
You want the product?

22:02.458 --> 22:04.083
-I need it.
-That's the price.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.375
We're ready, this way.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.333
Oh, man. No way. I'm in trouble.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.041
Cristina, I ran over here.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.458
-No worries. Were you able to get it?
-Yeah, here it is.

22:20.875 --> 22:24.416
Do you really think these products
can save the business from bankruptcy?

22:24.500 --> 22:26.041
Of course, my friend!

22:26.625 --> 22:30.375
Take a look at me here. I'm flawless.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.708
I'm just screwin' with you, girl.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.958
This is the face of success, Christie!

22:35.041 --> 22:36.375
You know where I studied?

22:36.458 --> 22:39.708
At the Success Coaching Sales School
for D-Norri products.

22:41.250 --> 22:45.916
With the Beauty Product Kit by D-Norri,
we guarantee temporary happiness.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.375
Have you ever had the feeling you found
something that will change your life?

22:50.458 --> 22:51.708
It's not just a feeling.

22:51.791 --> 22:54.458
It's the Lipo Big Blaster from D-Norri.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.916
The only product with aloe vera eyeballs
and tanager seeds.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.958
Hey, Simone.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.041
"Aloe vera eyeballs"?
Don't you mean "oil"?

23:02.125 --> 23:04.208
No, it's an eyeball, my friend.

23:04.291 --> 23:09.041
Aloe vera's like an exotic beast,
you know, it has a huge tail like this.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.583
-Huge teeth that--
-I won't sell any of that BS here.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.250
-Hello! Saigon, good morning.
-Yes! Thank you!

23:16.333 --> 23:17.291
Mmm-hmm.

23:17.875 --> 23:18.750
All right.

23:19.708 --> 23:22.666
Oh, girl, the only client I had…

23:24.208 --> 23:26.416
she thought this was Greice's salon.

23:26.916 --> 23:27.791
She canceled.

23:28.958 --> 23:30.708
Hey, kid! Oh, my God!

23:30.791 --> 23:33.833
Miss Greice is gonna kill me.
No, no, what are you doing, you little--

23:33.916 --> 23:35.416
-My name is Vitinho.
-Vitinho?

23:35.500 --> 23:37.750
That's what I said, bitch.
What do you want, Vitinho?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.750
Let's talk, Vitinho. Vitinho, don't…

23:39.833 --> 23:43.291
I want to have my hair cut!

23:43.375 --> 23:45.875
Well, Greice doesn't cut kids' hair, okay?

23:45.958 --> 23:48.583
Ahh! I wanna have my hair cut!

23:48.666 --> 23:50.333
-I wanna have my hair cut!
-Shh!

23:50.416 --> 23:54.000
Look. Look, I'll cut your hair, Vitinho.
I'll cut your hair. I'll cut your hair.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.875
But have you
ever cut someone's hair before?

23:55.958 --> 23:57.708
Sit down. There you go.

23:57.791 --> 23:59.583
We gotta comb first.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.708
So the clippers don't jam up on us.

24:02.791 --> 24:05.000
Holy shit!

24:05.625 --> 24:07.333
Come on! Where's the beep now?

24:07.833 --> 24:09.416
There's a kid here!

24:09.500 --> 24:14.000
I'll look like a star for the pre-party,
then the night really gets wild!

24:14.083 --> 24:17.250
Simone, I don't have the energy
for that sort of thing anymore.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.375
No, no, no! Hold on, hold on, hold on!

24:19.458 --> 24:22.500
I have a question for you,
but don't take it to heart.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.083
-Will you promise me?
-Uh-huh.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.708
You have to be honest with me.

24:27.583 --> 24:30.750
-Don't you ever get horny? Huh?
-Are you crazy? Of course I do!

24:30.833 --> 24:34.166
It's just that I alternate
between anxiety and horniness.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.000
I remember I'm horny and broke.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.041
And then the anxiety
smacks down my horniness.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.875
Hang on, this thing is vibrating.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.875
-Who is it? Hmm.
-Oh, my God! Yeah!

24:44.958 --> 24:46.375
PQD
Hi, gorgeous! It's been too long!

24:46.458 --> 24:48.416
-Who is that?
-I thought I had the wrong number.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.625
-"Wrong number"?
-Yeah!

24:49.708 --> 24:50.916
PQD
I'm still hot for you

24:51.000 --> 24:52.958
Explain it to me, I'm lost.
Who replied to you?

24:53.041 --> 24:54.916
PQD
Bet you're still hot. Can we meet?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.666
It's PQD, Simone!

24:56.750 --> 25:00.583
His aunt's cousin bumped into
my aunt's sister at the market.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.666
She said that he's separated now.
Can you believe that?

25:03.750 --> 25:06.125
PQD was so handsome.

25:06.208 --> 25:09.125
He's always wanted to hook up with me.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.958
And why didn't he, Christie?

25:11.041 --> 25:13.125
Oh, I was still in school.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.791
I wanted to be a teacher.

25:15.875 --> 25:19.583
I was a good student
and I had my whole life ahead of me.

25:19.666 --> 25:22.500
-And he didn't go to your school?
-No.

25:23.291 --> 25:24.833
He was already working,

25:24.916 --> 25:27.458
starting in the field of logistics.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.041
And I started going to nightclubs.

25:31.125 --> 25:34.208
I was there, feeling myself at the clubs.

25:34.291 --> 25:38.666
But then he joined the army.
That's when he became a paratrooper.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.833
But was he really a paratrooper?

25:40.916 --> 25:42.625
Well, sort of, yeah.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.000
When he quit,
he immediately looked for me.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.541
Okay, then what?

25:47.625 --> 25:50.083
I was already
getting married to Jura.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.250
Timing, Simone…

25:52.333 --> 25:55.708
We can't control it,
but maybe it's time now.

25:55.791 --> 25:58.125
Lift me some skin!

26:35.000 --> 26:36.750
I told you it will be lit!

26:36.833 --> 26:38.500
-You like it, right?
-I like it!

26:38.583 --> 26:40.541
I said it would look cool!

26:40.625 --> 26:42.958
-What's this?
-Look! I call it "compact."

26:43.041 --> 26:45.416
-Look at that! You did it yourself?
-Yeah.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.708
It looks great!

26:47.416 --> 26:49.000
What's that? What happened?

26:49.083 --> 26:51.041
What did you do to my son's hair?

26:51.125 --> 26:53.916
-Yeah, what did you do to her son's hair?
-Holy shit!

26:54.000 --> 26:55.375
I said that was a naughty word!

26:55.458 --> 26:58.583
I can't believe it, Greice Kelly.
My son learned to curse now?

26:58.666 --> 27:00.125
No, ma'am! He learned it online.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.708
-It wasn't me, I swear.
-Yeah, right.

27:01.791 --> 27:03.916
And now this guy even has the nerve

27:04.041 --> 27:05.791
to try and teach me
how to raise my own child?

27:05.875 --> 27:08.458
-I would never do that!
-It's disrespectful, Greice.

27:08.541 --> 27:12.291
Sweetie, when we get home, you and I
are gonna have a long conversation.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.083
Don't you dare!

27:15.166 --> 27:17.666
I won't pay for this horrible treatment,
Greice Kelly.

27:17.750 --> 27:20.583
And I am never,
never coming back here again!

27:20.666 --> 27:21.666
Let's go, baby.

27:22.666 --> 27:23.958
Bye, Egyptian prince!

27:24.541 --> 27:26.208
Calm. Calm.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.958
Miss Greice Kelly,
I did my job.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.416
I won't charge for the haircut.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.333
I took care of the kid, so…
the cauterizer?

27:32.416 --> 27:35.416
What job? I asked you to watch the child,
not give him a haircut.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.833
And now I lost a client.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.000
Uh, in my defense,
he was very difficult to deal with…

27:39.083 --> 27:41.416
Greice!

27:41.500 --> 27:44.250
Is this normal or what?

27:44.333 --> 27:46.500
Ms. Espir! What have they done to you?

27:46.583 --> 27:49.125
Look at my hair!

27:49.208 --> 27:52.291
-What is this? Oh!
-God! Someone changed the order of these.

27:52.375 --> 27:55.375
Look at me! You have to fix it!

27:55.458 --> 27:58.333
Miss Greice Kelly,
I expected better from you.

27:58.416 --> 28:01.333
Hey, at Saigon,
all of our products are top of the line!

28:01.416 --> 28:04.625
Yeah, right! You came to borrow mine!
Show me some respect.

28:04.708 --> 28:07.458
I had all those products
laid out in the right sequence.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.916
-You did it! You did this on purpose.
-No, I-- Come on! No!

28:11.000 --> 28:13.666
No, Grandma, I'd never do that on purpose.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.000
-Help me, Jesus.
-Get that product over here.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.916
At Saigon, Mom will fix it in a minute.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.625
Come on. Grandma, let's go.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.333
-Let's go to Saigon.
-This is my nightmare! Get me out!

28:25.083 --> 28:29.166
We're never coming back to this salon
where it's colorful and nice!

28:29.250 --> 28:31.500
Come on, Grandma! Grandma, we'll fix it.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.500
Oh, Simone, help me. It says here,
"Hi, gorgeous! It's been a while."

28:35.583 --> 28:36.750
What should I reply to that?

28:36.833 --> 28:38.958
You like my comebacks, don't you?

28:39.958 --> 28:40.791
Say…

28:41.583 --> 28:45.125
that you want to see him,
then send a baguette.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.708
-A baguette? But I didn't buy a baguette.
-Huh?

28:47.791 --> 28:51.000
An emoji, girl!
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.958
"I want to see you soon!"

28:58.083 --> 29:00.875
PQD
You wanna? Let's do it!

29:00.958 --> 29:02.541
Say "yes," girlfriend! Do it!

29:02.625 --> 29:03.458
"Yes!"

29:03.541 --> 29:04.708
CRISTINA
Yes!

29:05.208 --> 29:06.041
Oh!

29:07.416 --> 29:10.333
That's crazy! Oh, my God.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.208
I got butterflies in my stomach.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.375
Girl, I said "send a baguette."

29:16.458 --> 29:18.875
-You put hot butter all over it.
-What?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.333
Mom!

29:21.416 --> 29:24.708
I brought a client.
Check it, Mom, a client.

29:24.791 --> 29:27.875
Espir! What did they do to you?

29:27.958 --> 29:29.041
Stop it, Simone.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.958
Well, I guess I'll leave you to it.

29:31.041 --> 29:34.583
I have to sell my products.
Bye, bye, my friend!

29:34.666 --> 29:36.500
Look, Mom, a client. I got a client.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.958
Since when is my mother-in-law a client?
Go figure.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.083
Espir,
don't take offense, all right?

29:43.166 --> 29:45.708
But my Jura has left us,
he's in the Lord's arms,

29:45.791 --> 29:48.166
but I am not obligated to help here.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.500
Oh, yes, you are!

29:49.583 --> 29:53.250
I just wanted a day at the salon
to get a haircut, but no,

29:53.333 --> 29:55.333
your son shows up and did this to me.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.125
I was only trying to help, Grandma.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.083
-I didn't mean it.
-I see you have your chicken.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.166
Mother Andinha told you to buy it, right?

30:04.250 --> 30:07.041
"The chicken will show me the way."
Right, Feathers?

30:07.125 --> 30:09.625
Mmm-hmm. And you'll
take that chicken with you everywhere.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.083
Mommy! Gram, what happened?

30:12.166 --> 30:15.500
-Did you get shocked?
-Well, it's your brother's fault.

30:16.416 --> 30:17.666
I was just trying to…

30:19.000 --> 30:20.708
Mommy, this is Julinho.

30:20.791 --> 30:23.291
What is up, fam? You all good?

30:23.375 --> 30:25.291
What is he speaking?
I don't get it, Danielle.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.625
He's trying to use
the vocabulary from uptown.

30:27.708 --> 30:29.166
-Our slang, you know?
-Mmm-hmm.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.000
It's for his anthropological research.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.083
Yeah! The voice of your people moves me.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.916
"Moves." Okay, Danielle.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.333
You're dating this guy
to poke fun at us, right?

30:38.416 --> 30:40.583
-Uh, we're not exactly dating.
-We're not?

30:40.666 --> 30:41.833
You're not?

30:41.916 --> 30:45.666
Julinho's doing his thesis
about uptown anthropology.

30:45.750 --> 30:46.833
Mmm-hmm.

30:46.916 --> 30:49.750
If you want egg whites in your salad,
I'm not getting involved.

30:49.833 --> 30:52.541
I don't want to disrupt
this beautiful family of yours.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.708
I'm gonna hit the streets.

30:54.291 --> 30:55.791
-Be good, fam!
-Right.

30:56.291 --> 30:59.208
He's just doing research, all right?
You guys don't get it.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.666
Mom, I have an idea.
Why don't we update the salon?

31:04.750 --> 31:07.458
See, I could use that mirror
as a styling station--

31:07.541 --> 31:09.500
Okay, I know exactly
what you're trying to pull.

31:09.583 --> 31:10.416
You hear me, mister?

31:10.500 --> 31:12.375
You have a chicken
and now you're full of ideas.

31:12.458 --> 31:13.875
That's not what the chicken's about.

31:13.958 --> 31:16.875
-It's gonna reveal my path.
-Your path does not lead here.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.791
-Do me a favor and let me work.
-Mom…

31:21.875 --> 31:23.583
-Go on, beat it!
-Chill out, Mom!

31:23.666 --> 31:25.583
Leave me alone! Let me work!

31:28.625 --> 31:30.666
Hey, Feathers…

31:30.750 --> 31:33.791
Show me the way, please.

31:40.708 --> 31:41.916
Hey, Richardsson.

31:42.541 --> 31:44.333
-What's up, Johnny?
-Tough stuff?

31:44.416 --> 31:47.875
Why do I feel like we've
already had this conversation before?

31:48.500 --> 31:51.000
We tried,
but then your girlfriend interrupted.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.500
She's not my girlfriend, okay?

31:54.583 --> 31:58.333
Look, I don't want to pry,
but I heard Jorge wants the salon back.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.500
So you need cash. I want to help out.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.916
-Help out how, Johnny?
-The guys on the hill.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.833
They cut my cables again. It's not fair.

32:07.416 --> 32:09.500
But aren't those the cables
you connect over there

32:09.583 --> 32:11.708
to steal their internet
and sell it to us over here?

32:11.791 --> 32:14.333
Here,
the Green Lantern Militia rules, boy.

32:14.833 --> 32:18.541
"Green Lantern"? That name really sucks.
Why not "Wolverine"?

32:19.541 --> 32:20.750
Marvel blows.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.166
I need you to reconnect those cables.
Sound good?

32:24.250 --> 32:25.583
I'll pay you.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.083
-Uh, well, first I have an errand.
-No, do it now.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.833
-Pay me first.
-I'll pay after.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.000
-You'll pay, right?
-Come on!

32:38.833 --> 32:39.666
What about…

32:40.291 --> 32:43.083
you know, those channels?

32:43.166 --> 32:45.666
-What?
-Those channels…

32:46.916 --> 32:48.375
Oh!

32:49.333 --> 32:52.291
-What channels, huh?
-The dirty ones.

32:52.375 --> 32:53.791
Attaboy!

32:54.375 --> 32:57.375
Connect the cables, you'll get the cash
and the dirty channels.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.333
I'm on it. Deal, man.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.416
I'm good on that. I'm going now.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.458
Trust me. Trust me.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.250
PEACE

33:41.041 --> 33:42.291
Hold on, hold on.

33:43.375 --> 33:44.208
Here.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.916
I can't do it, Feathers.

34:06.125 --> 34:08.333
It's not right.

34:08.416 --> 34:10.583
I won't do it. Let's go.

34:11.125 --> 34:12.833
What do you think you're doing here, kid?

34:12.916 --> 34:16.208
Um, I, uh… I didn't do anything.
I was just curious.

34:16.291 --> 34:17.375
Wanted to check, that's all.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.625
How'd a punk like you
become a cable technician?

34:19.708 --> 34:20.666
Wait a minute, Ant,

34:20.750 --> 34:23.750
I'm pretty sure this kid is
part of that stupid Yellow Light Militia.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.041
Not "Yellow Light Militia,"
it's "Green Lantern."

34:26.125 --> 34:28.625
-I told them it was a sucky name.
-You are with the militia?

34:28.708 --> 34:31.166
If my boss hears about this, you're toast.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.958
No militia allowed in the favela.

34:33.041 --> 34:35.500
-Give me the chicken now! Come on!
-Easy, dude! I'm sorry!

34:35.583 --> 34:38.166
That's my friend!
What's with all the hostility, guys?

34:38.250 --> 34:40.000
I just came to do a friend a favor.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.125
I don't care. You'll have to pay now.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.875
"Pay now"? Come on.

34:43.958 --> 34:47.125
Guys, I didn't touch the cables.
Check it, I don't even understand it.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.666
-I didn't touch the cables.
-It's the thought that counts.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.416
-And now you have to pay a fee.
-"Pay a fee"?

34:54.625 --> 34:55.458
But…

34:55.541 --> 34:57.791
Well, things are really
hard for my family right now.

34:57.875 --> 35:00.958
Hey, your mom's the owner of Saigon.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.500
Bro, I went there
all the time as a kid.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.625
You haven't come by for a while.
Maybe you should come get a haircut.

35:06.708 --> 35:09.916
Hey, you better watch your mouth, kid!

35:10.000 --> 35:11.625
Yo, Ant, for real,

35:11.708 --> 35:14.041
you need to spruce up your look, huh?

35:14.833 --> 35:18.000
But old Saigon's past its prime now.
It's outdated.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.333
"Outdated"?
You know, I think your beard is outdated.

35:21.416 --> 35:23.083
-What's that, kid? Are you crazy?
-My bad.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.541
I have an idea. What if I
give you guys a haircut for free?

35:28.125 --> 35:29.875
-You've got balls.
-Yeah.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.791
-But I like the idea.
-For real?

35:32.875 --> 35:35.208
Let's go!
I'll tell my mom we have clients.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.666
-No!
-Hey, hey, hey! Where you going?

35:37.750 --> 35:41.416
-We're going up.
-Up where? What's "up" mean?

35:41.500 --> 35:42.666
Okay, easy.

35:50.291 --> 35:51.750
Don't pay too much attention.

35:58.666 --> 36:01.250
Don't get too attached.

36:05.041 --> 36:07.916
Since Razor Joe
only cuts hair for MC Marcinho,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.375
there's nobody left to cut our hair.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.541
If you pull off a dope haircut,

36:13.083 --> 36:15.000
you and the chicken are safe.

36:15.083 --> 36:16.333
Take it easy, Ant!

36:16.416 --> 36:18.291
Don't mess with the chicken, bro.

36:18.375 --> 36:21.750
-She's my buddy.
-I really think we should go to the salon.

36:21.833 --> 36:24.291
-At the salon, I'd feel--
-You better quit stallin' now, kid.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.333
-It's either here or…
-Come on, come on.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.291
I want a tight rainbow dye.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.375
Sides tight. Nothing too complicated.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.125
-Not complicated.
-White to red with a pompadour.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.125
White to red…

36:36.833 --> 36:40.083
You want a white-to-red rainbow pompadour?

36:41.625 --> 36:45.208
That's genius!
A white-to-red rainbow, uh, pompadour!

36:45.291 --> 36:46.208
Great idea.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.708
You're gonna start a new trend.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.333
Focus, Richardsson.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.041
It's all good.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.500
You can do it, son.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.083
What the hell, Richardsson?

37:17.166 --> 37:19.250
Seeing ghosts at a time like this.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.083
A ghost, boy? No.

37:21.666 --> 37:24.291
I want you to understand your history,
my son.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.583
Like some kinda plot device?

37:27.500 --> 37:28.833
Isn't that too cliché?

37:29.791 --> 37:31.750
If you prefer, I can be a ghost for you.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.750
I'll be a ghost, check this out.

37:34.583 --> 37:35.500
Boo!

37:35.583 --> 37:36.916
All right, Dad, stop!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.166
Stop! Don't do that!

37:38.250 --> 37:41.250
I liked you better as a plot device.
That was good.

37:41.333 --> 37:44.916
My son, pay attention.
I need you to remember who you are.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.416
You've got talent, like your mother.

37:48.041 --> 37:48.875
Do it.

37:48.958 --> 37:50.833
They'll ice me for sure if I mess up, Dad.

37:50.916 --> 37:51.833
Then do it right.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.000
Just do it your way.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.583
Just do it your way, Richardsson.

38:00.166 --> 38:01.208
Got it, Dad.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.375
So, how do you like it?

38:57.250 --> 38:59.250
Fucking awesome, man!

39:00.625 --> 39:02.666
You have the soul of an artist.

39:02.750 --> 39:06.041
Don't do go around doing shit
for that stupid Yellow Light guy.

39:07.375 --> 39:09.291
I'm glad you like it, for real.

39:09.791 --> 39:14.125
Next time I arrive at the party,
I'll be shining!

39:14.208 --> 39:16.875
You'll turn heads for sure, Ant!

39:17.708 --> 39:19.458
The clipper set's yours, brother.

39:20.375 --> 39:21.375
Come again?

39:22.125 --> 39:23.375
-It's mine?
-Yeah.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.250
I appreciate it!

39:26.208 --> 39:29.500
-You did good, fam. You can go now.
-So, do you want a receipt or something?

39:30.333 --> 39:31.541
Yeah, that'd be great.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.000
Yes, please.

39:35.583 --> 39:38.041
"That'd be great."

39:38.125 --> 39:39.875
A fuckin' receipt, kid?

39:40.958 --> 39:41.958
I was joking.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.666
Hold on, wait a minute.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.875
Hey, hey.

39:46.958 --> 39:49.625
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down real quick. Look.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.541
I forgot my signature.

40:07.541 --> 40:09.125
You see that, Feathers?

40:09.916 --> 40:11.458
I did real good, didn't I?

40:15.208 --> 40:18.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going in such a hurry, sir?

40:18.375 --> 40:20.291
Hurry? I'm not in a hurry, sir.

40:20.375 --> 40:22.625
I was just
walking fast because my mother's--

40:22.708 --> 40:25.208
Didn't you make a huge mess
at my cousin's salon?

40:25.291 --> 40:27.750
Oh, you must be Greice Kelly's cousin!

40:28.416 --> 40:30.291
I don't know about the salon, sir.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.166
-What's in the bag you got there?
-Which one?

40:32.250 --> 40:34.000
-That one on your shoulder.
-Open it.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.041
Damn! A hen, bro?

40:38.416 --> 40:39.958
What do you have in that case, sir?

40:40.041 --> 40:41.458
Hair-cutting equipment, sir.

40:41.541 --> 40:44.333
Ah! Where'd you get the stuff, huh?
The hair-cutting equipment?

40:44.416 --> 40:46.166
And what about
the receipt for that chicken?

40:46.250 --> 40:48.083
-I…
-Where'd you get all that stuff?

40:48.166 --> 40:50.583
The case was a present.
I got her at the aviary.

40:50.666 --> 40:53.125
"At the aviary," Almeida.

40:53.208 --> 40:55.583
Hey, are there any aviaries in the favela?

40:55.666 --> 40:57.916
Are you mocking my intelligence right now?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.750
No, sir. Far from it.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.166
Never. Never, sir, I promise you, sir.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.166
Check this out.

41:04.250 --> 41:06.958
DIRECT COMMUNICATION GROUP
Big Rat: Check out Ant's new look

41:07.041 --> 41:09.958
Take a look at Ant's new hairstyle!
How cool is that, man?

41:10.041 --> 41:11.416
Mmm-hmm!

41:11.500 --> 41:12.875
I did that.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.416
Animal stripes are my trademark.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.875
-It's dope as hell!
-It looks dope, I like it, boy.

41:17.958 --> 41:18.833
Excellent!

41:18.916 --> 41:21.250
But hang on a minute.
How come you guys have Ant's picture?

41:21.333 --> 41:24.125
Oh, it's just our favela text chain
that we use to…

41:24.208 --> 41:26.166
Whoa!
Don't try and change the subject, kid!

41:26.250 --> 41:28.416
Let's go back to the precinct
and clear all this up--

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
No, no, hold on, soldier.
Hold on, soldier.

41:32.916 --> 41:34.250
All right, here's the deal, kid.

41:36.166 --> 41:38.083
You give me a sick haircut

41:38.791 --> 41:41.125
and we'll let you go, boy.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.583
Hey, don't forget about my hair!

41:47.291 --> 41:49.458
PQD - Don't leave me hanging!
Send me a pic, too, hottie.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.666
Oh, damn…

41:51.875 --> 41:52.791
Simone…

41:53.791 --> 41:55.750
Simone, I need you here right now.

41:55.833 --> 41:58.083
It's urgent.
Hurry, I need you to help me right now.

41:58.166 --> 42:02.333
-Mommy!
-Danielle, for the love of God, look.

42:02.416 --> 42:04.791
Business is already slow
without you guys here.

42:04.875 --> 42:08.375
-What is he doing?
-It's for his thesis, Mommy.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.625
I love all the hostility!

42:10.708 --> 42:12.125
It's the representation

42:12.208 --> 42:14.833
of the structural divergence
of the division between classes.

42:14.916 --> 42:15.916
I'm gone.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.875
Danielle, you're dating him just
to annoy me, to pester me, aren't you?

42:18.958 --> 42:21.125
I'm not exactly dating him.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.416
Hey, Julinho,
don't take pictures without permission.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.458
-It's not cool, okay?
-But it's anthropological study.

42:26.541 --> 42:28.750
If I warn you,
it drains the truth from the moment.

42:28.833 --> 42:29.791
Excuse me, sorry.

42:30.375 --> 42:33.708
-Girlfriend, what happened? What's wrong?
-Thank you for coming. I need some advice.

42:33.791 --> 42:36.125
Jesus!
I wasn't prepared for that.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.500
You don't even need to zoom in.

42:37.583 --> 42:38.666
God's peace.

42:39.583 --> 42:43.625
-Want to set it as your wallpaper?
-God's peace. I'm looking for Richardsson.

42:43.708 --> 42:45.791
No, no, Richardsson hasn't come back yet.

42:45.875 --> 42:48.541
But there's two lost lambs for you.
Do your thing. Excuse me.

42:48.625 --> 42:50.666
-Hey, Pastor.
-Simone, inside. Inside, quick.

42:50.750 --> 42:54.333
Danielle. Danielle, I'm really worried.
Please, I have to talk to your brother.

42:54.416 --> 42:56.875
Talk? Oh, Pastor,
why not try listening once?

42:56.958 --> 43:00.083
Our minds are full from all these people
telling us what to do.

43:00.166 --> 43:02.208
Hang on.
Did your brother tell you to say this?

43:02.291 --> 43:04.000
My brother's not my boss!

43:04.083 --> 43:05.541
That's so chauvinistic!

43:06.375 --> 43:08.333
Well, perhaps you're right about that.

43:08.416 --> 43:11.125
I need to modernize the service,
that's true.

43:11.208 --> 43:14.500
-I should listen to the youth's language.
-Brilliant!

43:14.583 --> 43:17.625
Pastor, could you repeat it for me?
Act like I'm not here.

43:22.625 --> 43:24.791
All right,
follow these steps.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.791
On the right foot. Come on. To the right.

43:27.875 --> 43:28.916
Faster.

43:31.583 --> 43:35.125
Hey, hold on! Wait! Wait! Wait for me! Oh!

43:35.208 --> 43:36.750
You guys started without me?

43:36.833 --> 43:39.291
Did you forget how a clock works, bro?

43:39.375 --> 43:40.583
Still with that chicken?

43:40.666 --> 43:44.041
It's "Feathers." She's gonna
show me my path, remember, Quel?

43:44.125 --> 43:46.250
Brother, I'm so sorry I ran late.

43:46.333 --> 43:49.000
A cop stopped me on the way here
and wanted me to cut his hair.

43:49.083 --> 43:51.500
Legit. You have no idea
what to do with your life.

43:51.583 --> 43:54.041
-What's that mean?
-You gave Ant a dope haircut.

43:54.125 --> 43:56.000
We all saw it.

43:56.083 --> 43:58.625
-The color was lit.
-Wait a minute, how do you know?

43:58.708 --> 44:00.208
Are y'all in the cops' text chain, too?

44:00.291 --> 44:03.333
-Can someone add me to it, please?
-What text chain, bro?

44:03.416 --> 44:05.125
Don't you know? It's on TV!

44:05.208 --> 44:07.333
-On TV, Doninho?
-Check it! See?

44:08.000 --> 44:11.583
Talk to us, Ant. Please, Ant.
Wait, damn it! Fuck!

44:11.666 --> 44:14.416
Ant, what did you do?
Could you tell it to the camera?

44:14.500 --> 44:16.833
A pompadour with a rainbow dye!

44:16.916 --> 44:19.166
The stylist was Richardsson for Saigon.

44:19.250 --> 44:20.875
The boy's a real artist, right?

44:20.958 --> 44:22.916
No, Ant, I'm talking about your crime.
Focus.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.375
Oh, I don't know, man. I'm innocent.

44:25.916 --> 44:30.541
My name's not Ant.
Now my name is Dope Pompadour, baby!

44:33.500 --> 44:36.416
-Wow! I'm on TV, man!
-Told you!

44:36.500 --> 44:38.500
-Cool.
-You get to show off now!

44:38.583 --> 44:41.791
What a cool animal print.
Well done, Big Head.

44:43.208 --> 44:44.875
It's good to know there's finally

44:44.958 --> 44:47.708
a place in the neighborhood
for us to get a haircut now.

44:47.791 --> 44:49.750
You want a haircut, brother?

44:49.833 --> 44:51.500
Yeah, a fresh cut would be good.

44:51.583 --> 44:52.583
Me too!

44:52.666 --> 44:54.708
So, are you working at your mom's salon?

44:54.791 --> 44:56.541
You updating Saigon?

44:56.625 --> 44:59.000
Nah, my mom's
in the dark about all this, man.

44:59.083 --> 45:01.125
If she finds out, bro, it's all over.

45:01.208 --> 45:02.416
I would run.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.000
You'd take off, right?

45:04.083 --> 45:06.541
I don't know why
your mom's being like that.

45:06.625 --> 45:09.375
It's weird.
Everyone deserves a dope haircut.

45:09.458 --> 45:11.583
I hear you. Ms. Cristina is too stubborn.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.958
Yeah, but she'll come around.

45:14.041 --> 45:15.250
It's a matter of time.

45:15.875 --> 45:16.791
Thanks, babe.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.833
-You're talented, kid.
-For real?

45:18.916 --> 45:21.125
Say that to Ms. Cristina for me.

45:21.208 --> 45:24.166
Yo, Cheese Curd.
It's time to shoot the rap video, man.

45:24.250 --> 45:25.583
-For real?
-Yeah, come on, come on.

45:25.666 --> 45:28.041
-You rollin'?
-I'm nervous about tonight's show.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.208
Come on, brother, why be nervous?

45:31.250 --> 45:32.541
You're gonna slay.

45:32.625 --> 45:34.500
But you don't know that for sure,
Big Head.

45:34.583 --> 45:36.500
Yeah, but I can cheer in the stands.

45:38.583 --> 45:39.625
Come along.

45:39.708 --> 45:42.166
Ah, no can do.
I'm taking care of the chicken.

45:42.666 --> 45:44.000
-Right.
-Bye.

45:44.875 --> 45:47.375
Bye.

45:57.791 --> 45:59.333
Oh, come on, guys!

45:59.916 --> 46:02.000
I didn't do it! Get off my back!

46:19.208 --> 46:21.708
-Wow! What?
-Wow! Awesome, Vitinho!

46:21.791 --> 46:25.708
-Who gave you that haircut, man?
-It was my stylist, Richardsson.

46:28.416 --> 46:30.416
It's all right! Chill out, Feathers.

46:31.875 --> 46:35.375
I like it! Man, that boy is talented.
This is right, huh?

46:35.458 --> 46:37.708
It's nice and straight, huh, man?

46:38.333 --> 46:39.791
Hey, show me yours.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.833
Well, you know, mine is okay.
More or less.

46:41.916 --> 46:43.541
Huh. No, it looks really good, man.

46:43.625 --> 46:44.583
SAIGON
BEAUTY SALON

46:44.666 --> 46:46.166
All right. Here, here.

46:46.250 --> 46:48.375
The lighting is just perfect in here.

46:48.458 --> 46:51.375
Come on, you're making me
nervous with that thing, Simone.

46:51.458 --> 46:53.416
Trust me! Remember?

46:53.500 --> 46:55.458
I took an interior lighting workshop.

46:55.541 --> 46:57.875
My certification
took 30 hours to complete.

46:57.958 --> 47:00.375
Oh, now she knows interior lighting too.

47:00.458 --> 47:03.458
The queen of light! All lit up!
Are you sure I need all that?

47:03.541 --> 47:05.750
Tell me,
how else would you take a nude?

47:05.833 --> 47:07.166
"A nude"? Who said "a nude"?

47:07.250 --> 47:08.875
-You did, baby!
-Me?

47:08.958 --> 47:12.458
Aw, Feathers.
You pooped all over the damn bag.

47:12.541 --> 47:15.083
Hello, hundredth lamb of the Lord!

47:15.166 --> 47:17.958
Easy, Pastor, you gotta stop scaring me.

47:18.041 --> 47:22.458
Beloved, I have to ask you,
did you get mad at me or at the church?

47:22.541 --> 47:25.541
You know that I only
want what's best for you.

47:25.625 --> 47:26.875
That's the thing, Pastor.

47:27.458 --> 47:29.208
Everybody means well.

47:29.291 --> 47:33.291
Cool, but no one is interested
in knowing what I want for me.

47:33.375 --> 47:36.875
-You hear me?
-Come by and see tonight's service!

47:36.958 --> 47:38.958
Because it's going to be divine!

47:39.041 --> 47:41.791
We are even gonna have
a special guest appearance!

47:41.875 --> 47:43.750
-Like a feat, Pastor?
-What?

47:43.833 --> 47:47.041
A feat! It's when there's a special
guest appearance, right, Feathers?

47:47.125 --> 47:49.958
Lord have mercy.
Everyone is speaking in tongues now.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.833
Let's get our God on!

47:51.916 --> 47:54.208
Really? I'll be there!

47:54.291 --> 47:56.750
-All right, Greice, here we are.
-"Get our God on!"

47:56.833 --> 47:59.416
I want a complete remodel.
This is like stopping in time.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

48:01.583 --> 48:03.166
Richardsson, stay out of this.

48:03.250 --> 48:06.583
We're dealing with an issue
you're still too young to understand.

48:06.666 --> 48:07.833
My space is too small,

48:07.916 --> 48:11.041
so now this is going to be
an annex of Greice Kelly's Coiffeur.

48:11.125 --> 48:12.708
I got it. Wait, no, no, but… hold this.

48:12.791 --> 48:16.208
An annex would be next to it,
so that doesn't make sense.

48:16.291 --> 48:18.541
And what is it, smart ass?

48:19.125 --> 48:21.000
Um, that is called "a branch."

48:21.083 --> 48:23.791
-A branch, you know?
-Okay, a branch, whatever.

48:23.875 --> 48:26.250
-A branch! I like that. Let's see.
-No, wait!

48:26.333 --> 48:28.250
Mr. Jorge, nobody told my mom.

48:28.333 --> 48:30.416
When she discovers
you're selling to Greice Kelly,

48:30.500 --> 48:32.416
she's totally gonna lose it!
She'll freak out!

48:32.500 --> 48:34.958
Richardsson, get the hell out of my way,
will you?

48:35.041 --> 48:37.291
Wow, Mr. Jorge. Look at that, Feathers!

48:37.375 --> 48:40.375
Guys, don't go in!
Hey, guys, I'll get in trouble!

48:40.916 --> 48:42.375
This floor is terrible.

48:42.458 --> 48:44.208
We need to have it changed.
This rack also--

48:44.291 --> 48:47.041
What the hell?
What are you doing here, Greice?

48:47.125 --> 48:48.833
Who? Who let you in here?

48:48.916 --> 48:50.750
Richardsson, you blew it again!

48:50.833 --> 48:53.000
I told them not to enter,
but they did it anyway!

48:53.583 --> 48:55.458
I'm the one who let her in, Cristina.

48:55.541 --> 48:58.208
This is my building
and Greice Kelly is interested in renting.

48:58.833 --> 49:02.000
I already gave you notice, Cristina.
Your deadline is today.

49:02.083 --> 49:04.875
Tomorrow, this salon has to be empty.
You hear me?

49:04.958 --> 49:07.416
Cristina, thank you
for everything you've taught me.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.250
I do the exact opposite
and it's successful.

49:10.958 --> 49:14.750
See, Jorge? That rat's
all about stabbing people in the back.

49:14.833 --> 49:15.916
You're gonna be next.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.375
-She's not gonna pay you.
-Yeah, all right. All right.

49:18.458 --> 49:22.083
But of course I'll pay.
My business is doing so well.

49:22.166 --> 49:24.375
I'll use this space
to finally open my annex.

49:24.458 --> 49:26.666
It's not an annex,
Ms. Greice, it's a branch.

49:26.750 --> 49:29.083
-That one.
-Shut your mouth, Richardsson.

49:29.166 --> 49:31.666
Why don't I annex my hand
across your lying--

49:31.750 --> 49:33.166
-Christie!
-Whoa!

49:33.250 --> 49:35.916
Hold on, Mom! You're gonna
lose the argument if you hit her!

49:36.000 --> 49:39.833
Argument, shmargument!
I can do whatever I want!

49:39.916 --> 49:41.666
This is my building!

49:41.750 --> 49:44.375
-If I don't get paid, I'll find another…
-Hang on! Feathers, no!

49:44.458 --> 49:46.541
No! Ahh!

49:48.208 --> 49:50.708
I said you have to fix that sign!

49:51.500 --> 49:54.333
Yeah, I'm gonna sage this spot first.

49:54.416 --> 49:56.875
-After you move out.
-The chicken's fine, guys.

49:58.041 --> 50:00.333
Christie, calm down. Christie, calm down.

50:00.416 --> 50:02.791
-We'll figure it out, Mom.
-Figure out what, Richardsson?

50:02.875 --> 50:05.125
Your can't even
perform a proper sacrifice.

50:05.208 --> 50:07.125
I was just trying to help, that's all.

50:07.208 --> 50:09.791
Help? I know how you're trying to help.

50:09.875 --> 50:13.458
You think I don't know you've
been doing jobs for those Militia guys?

50:13.541 --> 50:15.625
No, Mom. That's not what happened.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.708
I was just giving those guys
some cool haircuts.

50:17.791 --> 50:19.916
-That's it.
-Richardsson…

50:20.000 --> 50:23.083
I thought I'd raised you properly,
but I see I couldn't do it.

50:23.166 --> 50:24.708
You wanna be useful?

50:24.791 --> 50:27.541
Start packing. I'm playing my last card.

50:28.875 --> 50:30.583
I'll look for an investor.

50:31.500 --> 50:32.875
I'm my father's daughter.

50:33.708 --> 50:34.708
I'll bend…

50:35.458 --> 50:36.458
but I won't break.

50:36.541 --> 50:39.208
-Wait, are you saying you're going to--
-Sardine!

50:39.291 --> 50:40.708
Oh, Mother of God!

50:57.000 --> 51:00.166
PACHECO'S SOUND
RENTAL CHAIRS FOR EVENTS

51:12.958 --> 51:15.416
Our love knew we had to wait.

51:16.208 --> 51:18.583
My heart's burning with desire.

51:18.666 --> 51:20.458
Cristina, you're the--

51:20.541 --> 51:23.541
Cristina,
you are the love of my life.

51:24.125 --> 51:26.833
And I swear to you, I'll always…

51:26.916 --> 51:28.375
Good evening, sir.

51:28.458 --> 51:30.416
Is this all for my mom?

51:30.500 --> 51:31.791
Ah!

51:31.875 --> 51:34.541
-Are you Cristina's son?
-Yes, since I was born.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.916
-Richardsson?
-That's me. And you are?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.791
A pleasure. I'm PQD.

51:39.875 --> 51:40.708
Huh.

51:41.916 --> 51:44.166
I wanted to surprise your mother, but…

51:44.250 --> 51:47.250
Surprise? Well,
my mom doesn't really like surprises.

51:47.333 --> 51:50.250
She usually gets scared and upset,
then starts yelling at the person.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.666
-Oh
-Yeah.

51:52.333 --> 51:54.041
Well, tell her I stopped by, okay?

51:54.125 --> 51:55.666
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

51:56.583 --> 51:59.416
You're an old friend of hers, right?
You can wait inside.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.000
She'll be back, you feel me?

52:03.500 --> 52:05.750
Cristina's a hell of a girl, isn't she?

52:08.500 --> 52:09.750
Yeah, she really is.

52:23.416 --> 52:26.166
I like that glow you get on your face
when you talk about my mother.

52:37.333 --> 52:40.083
Your mom has always been pretty.
I was in love with her.

52:40.166 --> 52:42.166
She used to wear
this beautiful red lipstick.

52:42.250 --> 52:45.250
One day, we went on a date
and she left the lipstick with me.

52:45.333 --> 52:48.000
She said she'd come back to get it,
but she never did.

52:49.083 --> 52:51.166
And you didn't
give it back to her?

52:51.250 --> 52:53.333
I was too young. What did I know?

52:54.083 --> 52:56.833
I was trying out for Madureira FC.

52:56.916 --> 52:58.666
I was a skilled left-winger.

52:59.166 --> 53:02.041
-Why didn't you go pro?
-Stop! Stop it, guys!

53:02.125 --> 53:03.875
Damn, kid, you really suck.

53:03.958 --> 53:07.416
I loved going out.
I went dancing at clubs.

53:07.916 --> 53:10.666
And I don't mean to brag,
but I was a hit with the ladies.

53:11.291 --> 53:13.083
I was a sweet talker.

53:13.166 --> 53:16.000
It seems your sweet talk
didn't work on my mom, though.

53:16.083 --> 53:18.375
At the time, I was joining the army.

53:18.458 --> 53:20.083
Come on, you bunch of sissies!

53:20.166 --> 53:21.541
The training was brutal.

53:21.625 --> 53:23.250
I want to see that curb

53:23.333 --> 53:24.791
all white!

53:27.750 --> 53:29.625
And your mom was busy studying.

53:30.125 --> 53:31.875
She wanted to be a teacher.

53:31.958 --> 53:34.250
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.

53:34.750 --> 53:38.500
She's worked at Saigon
for as long as I can remember.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.458
No condensed milk for you!

53:40.541 --> 53:42.166
I left the army.

53:42.750 --> 53:45.541
By then, your mother was already married.

53:48.041 --> 53:51.625
The story of you and my mom
sounds like a soap opera, PQD.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.625
And I never gave
that red lipstick back to her.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.750
I know what'll lift your spirits,
a haircut! How about it?

54:05.833 --> 54:08.333
Come, have a seat.
Let me cut your hair for you.

54:08.416 --> 54:10.166
It's gonna look live, bro.

54:18.916 --> 54:20.833
Your mom is an amazing woman.

54:21.875 --> 54:24.583
Sometimes I think
she never really wanted to date me.

54:25.375 --> 54:27.875
There was always something in the way,
you know?

54:27.958 --> 54:29.375
She always came up with an excuse.

54:29.458 --> 54:32.500
Maybe you just
needed to give it some time.

54:32.583 --> 54:33.791
-You know, man?
-Right.

54:35.000 --> 54:35.833
I think I'm…

54:35.916 --> 54:38.125
Well, I'm just getting
in my head right now, you know?

54:39.250 --> 54:40.666
I have a lump in my throat.

54:42.083 --> 54:44.875
Your mother was always
way out of my league.

54:45.791 --> 54:47.458
Gorgeous girl like that…

54:47.541 --> 54:48.541
Here's my two cents.

54:48.625 --> 54:51.708
She fell in love with my father
'cause he was a great man.

54:52.333 --> 54:55.416
Hard working, respectful,
and most of all, he liked her.

54:56.125 --> 54:57.916
I see the same qualities in you.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.791
Right on. Right on.

54:59.875 --> 55:02.125
Here, an ace in the hole.

55:02.916 --> 55:03.750
This.

55:04.291 --> 55:05.833
Give her this lipstick.

55:09.625 --> 55:11.125
Perfect, kid, that's it!

55:11.208 --> 55:13.583
That's genius!

55:13.666 --> 55:15.125
I appreciate the advice.

55:15.208 --> 55:16.541
Here's something for you.

55:17.416 --> 55:20.583
When your time finally comes,
don't snooze like me.

55:20.666 --> 55:22.916
Feel me? Don't miss the opportunity.

55:24.458 --> 55:26.000
-All right?
-All right.

55:26.083 --> 55:28.500
-Oh, and thank you for the haircut.
-Yeah, no worries, man.

55:28.583 --> 55:30.666
-See you.
-Later, PQD.

55:35.416 --> 55:36.541
Richardsson!

55:38.541 --> 55:40.541
What's up, Quel? You cool?

55:40.625 --> 55:43.583
-I didn't know you were coming over.
-Am I interrupting? Should I leave?

55:43.666 --> 55:46.708
Nah, it's not you.
I just have to pack up all this stuff.

55:49.333 --> 55:51.125
I'll miss you at school.

55:52.416 --> 55:55.333
Ah, Quel, we'll still
see each other plenty of time.

55:55.416 --> 55:57.875
Especially if you
keep just showin' up out of the blue…

56:06.125 --> 56:08.291
Real talk, I don't feel comfortable--

56:08.375 --> 56:11.291
Yeah, Richardsson. That's it.

56:11.375 --> 56:13.750
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, what's up?

56:13.833 --> 56:17.416
Bring her it in for a hug, bro.
Don't let her convince you.

56:17.500 --> 56:18.833
Convince me of what, bro?

56:18.916 --> 56:21.416
Convince you to give him
a haircut for the show.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.458
Oh. Oh, that right.
Um, I just packed everything up.

56:25.541 --> 56:27.416
Saigon is closed. I'm sorry.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.166
Oh, well, it must be a sign then.

56:29.250 --> 56:31.416
-Let's roll, baby.
-No, babe, it's your big day!

56:31.500 --> 56:34.250
-This is my look. I like my dreads.
-Richardsson!

56:34.333 --> 56:36.208
-What?
-Everybody wants you to cut their hair!

56:36.291 --> 56:37.500
Say something.

56:37.583 --> 56:39.250
Uh, he likes his dreads, Quel!

56:39.333 --> 56:42.291
What can I do?
If you like 'em, keep 'em, my brother.

56:42.375 --> 56:43.916
Don't let anyone…

56:44.916 --> 56:45.750
No.

56:45.833 --> 56:48.708
…tell you it's not time for a change,
change can be good.

56:48.791 --> 56:50.916
Look, I won't cut your dreads, sound good?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.791
-Sit down, sit down.
-Yeah, sit down.

56:52.875 --> 56:54.250
I'll get pictures with my phone.

56:54.333 --> 56:57.500
Yeah, Quel, do it. It's gonna be epic.

56:58.041 --> 56:58.916
Hmm!

56:59.000 --> 57:01.083
Check out Papa's equipment.

57:01.166 --> 57:02.291
Holy shit!

57:02.375 --> 57:06.166
Wow, this is
Saigon's swan song, my brother.

57:06.250 --> 57:08.875
I'm at your mercy, man.

57:09.750 --> 57:11.416
Just trust me, brother.

57:11.500 --> 57:12.666
-Trust.
-Look over here.

57:23.916 --> 57:25.208
#SaigonIsOn

57:26.708 --> 57:27.583
Lookin' good!

57:37.750 --> 57:39.291
#SaigonIsOpen

57:39.875 --> 57:41.166
All done, my friend.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.875
It's badass, dawg!

57:42.958 --> 57:45.208
You nailed it.
No joke. I'm really impressed.

57:45.291 --> 57:48.291
I hate to sound full of it,
but it's a work of art.

57:48.375 --> 57:50.333
You're my masterpiece!

57:50.416 --> 57:51.708
Who is it?

57:51.791 --> 57:53.916
Hey, uh, can I be next, man? Much respect.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.833
What's up, Richardsson?
I want to get a fade!

57:55.916 --> 57:58.083
"A fade" my ass! Excuse me, fam!
Get out, out, out!

57:58.166 --> 58:01.125
-Come on, man! I'm telling you!
-I'm serious! Come on!

58:01.708 --> 58:03.791
I sent it to our text chain.

58:04.791 --> 58:06.708
Yo, I'm the only one
not on that text chain.

58:06.791 --> 58:07.791
It's gotta be personal.

58:07.875 --> 58:10.416
Hey, I can't cut Tandro
and Doninho's hair right now!

58:10.500 --> 58:12.291
I shouldn't have
even touched Cheese Curd's.

58:12.375 --> 58:14.416
-Have my back, bro!
-You're doing really good.

58:14.500 --> 58:16.625
-Everyone likes it, man.
-He's right, you're doing good.

58:16.708 --> 58:18.541
You gotta cut everyone's hair now.

58:18.625 --> 58:20.541
How can I cut--

58:20.625 --> 58:22.875
Feathers! Please guide me.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.916
Tandro and Doninho are outside,
what do I do?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.625
Feathers, where are you going?

58:29.833 --> 58:32.833
Jura,
shouldn't you have left for work?

58:32.916 --> 58:34.458
It's a surprise.

58:35.041 --> 58:37.541
I arranged a deal for my resignation.

58:37.625 --> 58:38.958
I'm gonna kill you.

58:39.458 --> 58:41.916
Nah, I took a deal for good money.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.541
We can buy some chairs,
install air conditioning,

58:44.625 --> 58:46.708
put a neon sign outside, huh?

58:46.791 --> 58:48.708
Jura, it was a good public job.

58:48.791 --> 58:50.458
No! My love…

58:51.166 --> 58:52.958
I want to invest in our salon.

58:53.041 --> 58:54.583
-"In our salon."
-Yeah.

58:54.666 --> 58:55.791
Yeah, in our…

58:56.458 --> 58:57.583
our salon.

58:57.666 --> 58:58.750
Our salon.

59:01.166 --> 59:02.291
No man…

59:02.375 --> 59:05.250
strays too far
from where the corn is roast.

59:07.458 --> 59:09.416
Be brave, Richardsson.

59:10.833 --> 59:12.708
Own up to what you are.

59:12.791 --> 59:14.875
Find your place in the world.

59:15.375 --> 59:17.875
But have you
ever cut someone's hair before?

59:17.958 --> 59:19.416
You have the soul of an artist.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.458
Hey! Whoa, what the heck, people?

59:31.541 --> 59:34.791
No, it's too many people! Too many people!
No, too much hair! I can't! No!

59:34.875 --> 59:37.291
Relax, Richardsson.
Should I tell them the salon is closed?

59:37.375 --> 59:40.875
I've never cut that much hair, Quel,
but we can't close the salon.

59:40.958 --> 59:43.916
Saigon's my parent's dream.
My dream, Quel…

59:53.208 --> 59:55.791
'Sup, fam? Shh! Chill.

59:55.875 --> 59:57.500
Saigon is back in business!

59:57.583 --> 1:00:00.458
Yo, my friends
pay half the double price, deal?

1:00:00.541 --> 1:00:02.208
Come on in, guys. Get in.

1:00:03.250 --> 1:00:04.625
Now, we're talkin', bro!

1:00:04.708 --> 1:00:06.291
All that hair, Tandro? No way!

1:00:06.375 --> 1:00:08.541
You're paying double, man.

1:00:21.416 --> 1:00:23.625
Hey!
Are you listening, Sardine?

1:00:23.708 --> 1:00:24.875
Stop and listen to me.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:27.125
Let's settle what
I came to discuss with you.

1:00:27.208 --> 1:00:28.708
How about we talk tomorrow, baby?

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:30.333
Let's dance. Let's samba.

1:00:30.416 --> 1:00:32.583
Sardine, stop! Just stop it.

1:00:32.666 --> 1:00:34.708
Listen, I don't want to be with you.

1:00:34.791 --> 1:00:37.958
I want your friendship,
but right now, all I need is your money!

1:00:38.041 --> 1:00:40.916
Will you please lend it to me or not?

1:00:46.833 --> 1:00:48.708
#Fade

1:00:52.583 --> 1:00:55.125
There's nothing I can do. I'm broke.

1:00:55.208 --> 1:00:56.791
Broke, Cristina.

1:00:56.875 --> 1:00:58.708
Things are tough right now.

1:01:01.916 --> 1:01:02.791

I want some sugar.

1:01:09.208 --> 1:01:11.208
Come on, give me a kiss. It's nothing.

1:01:11.291 --> 1:01:13.166
Like this……a kiss.

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:21.291
Oh, Cristina…

1:01:21.375 --> 1:01:24.041
A deep fried Sardine sure hurts the heart.

Wow, baby bro!
You're killin' it in here!

1:01:54.291 --> 1:01:56.083
Yo! How's it going?

1:01:56.166 --> 1:01:59.500
Danielle saying good things about me?
For real? Do you have a fever, Sis?

1:01:59.583 --> 1:02:02.625
Give me a minute to warm up.
I'm saving it for later.

1:02:02.708 --> 1:02:04.833
So is it true that you
don't want to go to college?

1:02:05.416 --> 1:02:08.625
Don't believe everything Mom tells you.
I'll go to college, sure.

1:02:08.708 --> 1:02:11.708
But I'll study subjects
that help our business here, Saigon.

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:14.208
Well, maybe you could study economics.

1:02:14.291 --> 1:02:16.916
Then you could really break the bank.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.791
-Guys, come on, let's take a picture.
-Do it.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:23.333
-I'll post it, okay?
-Yeah, post it.

1:02:24.750 --> 1:02:26.583
When will you admit you're in love?

1:02:26.666 --> 1:02:28.541
She's spoken for, Dani.

1:02:28.625 --> 1:02:30.500
I don't want to get in the middle of that.

1:02:30.583 --> 1:02:31.833
Stop being a fool, dude.

1:02:31.916 --> 1:02:34.625
You're oppressed by the
monogamous patriarchal structure.

1:02:34.708 --> 1:02:37.000
I wouldn't know where to begin.

1:02:37.083 --> 1:02:38.833
But have you even tried?

1:02:40.458 --> 1:02:45.166
I'm digging this search for
African ancestry that's going on here.

1:02:45.250 --> 1:02:48.208
-That's where humanity came from--
-Enough, Julinho!

1:02:48.291 --> 1:02:49.875
Enough! I've had enough!

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:53.208
You're just another white man
who's tired of your bland culture.

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:54.541
Look, this is real life!

1:02:54.625 --> 1:02:56.500
Take a look around!

1:02:56.583 --> 1:02:59.041
No, Dani, you don't get it.
I was only trying to--

1:02:59.125 --> 1:03:01.208
No! You don't get it, Julinho!

1:03:01.291 --> 1:03:03.125
Decolonize yourself, guy.

1:03:03.625 --> 1:03:06.000
-Jesus.
-No joke.

1:03:06.083 --> 1:03:07.625
Just live life, my friend.

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:12.625
That's what I call reparation.

1:03:12.708 --> 1:03:16.083
Look, the only reason she's with that guy
is to annoy our mom.

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:19.666
-Come on, tell me the truth, Sis.
-We're not dating, okay, Richardsson?

1:03:19.750 --> 1:03:21.000
Especially not now.

1:03:22.375 --> 1:03:26.708
By the way, when Mom finds out about
all this, you're in big trouble, man.

1:03:26.791 --> 1:03:28.000
-Wow.
-Watch out!

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:30.291
-Are you upset now, Danielle?
-I just might tell her.

1:03:30.375 --> 1:03:31.958
-I'll clean up, okay?
-Uh-huh.

1:03:32.041 --> 1:03:33.708
She'll never know about it!
She's a snitch.

1:03:42.041 --> 1:03:44.625
I see you, Big Head,
you made a ton of cash!

1:03:45.666 --> 1:03:48.541
Everyone wants to
look good for a party, right?

1:03:48.625 --> 1:03:50.958
The before party
is already happening here, right?

1:03:51.541 --> 1:03:52.833
Excuse me!

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:54.708
Let me through! Out!

1:03:54.791 --> 1:03:56.333
Excuse me!

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:58.291
Boy,
look at Cheese Curd's hair!

1:03:58.375 --> 1:04:00.083
Man, it is a masterpiece. A work of art.

1:04:00.166 --> 1:04:02.708
What is going on in my salon?

1:04:02.791 --> 1:04:04.500
Since when is the party in here?

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:07.625
The party's out in the square! Get out!

1:04:07.708 --> 1:04:09.458
Get out of here! Everyone!

1:04:10.750 --> 1:04:12.333
-Good luck, Big Head.
-Thanks.

1:04:12.416 --> 1:04:14.291
-If you need it, I can help patch you up.
-Okay.

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:15.375
Come on, Auntie!

1:04:15.458 --> 1:04:16.875
Out! Keep all that on!

1:04:19.291 --> 1:04:21.333
You, too, Mr. Luís!

1:04:22.833 --> 1:04:25.083
What are you doing with my salon,
Richardsson?

1:04:25.583 --> 1:04:27.041
I can explain, Mom.

1:04:27.125 --> 1:04:30.791
I was packing everything up
and Cheese Curd and Raquel stopped by.

1:04:30.875 --> 1:04:33.875
-Mom, I cut everybody's hair--
-Richardsson, I told you a thousand times.

1:04:33.958 --> 1:04:35.125
I don't want you here.

1:04:35.833 --> 1:04:38.916
You have to keep on studying.
There's no future for you here.

1:04:40.625 --> 1:04:43.041
What are you doing with your life, my son?

1:04:43.125 --> 1:04:44.958
What are you doing to yourself?

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:48.500
Honey, look at who
you're hanging out with.

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:49.708
Wait. Wait a minute.

1:04:50.208 --> 1:04:52.250
Mom, you shouldn't lose faith in me.

1:04:52.333 --> 1:04:55.125
I swear, I never did
anything to betray your trust.

1:04:55.208 --> 1:04:57.666
Everyone keeps telling me
what I'm supposed to do,

1:04:57.750 --> 1:04:59.583
how to do it, when to do it, Ma.

1:04:59.666 --> 1:05:02.083
I can! I'm your mother.

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:05.375
I'm supposed to do that!

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.083
I say what, how,
and when you should do something!

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:11.000
And you gotta listen! Okay?

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:14.541
You can't, Mom.

1:05:15.125 --> 1:05:16.250
You can't, Mom.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.375
I have the task of finding my own path.

1:05:21.583 --> 1:05:24.083
And I have to do this task by myself, Mom.

1:05:24.166 --> 1:05:25.916
It has to be on my own.

1:05:26.708 --> 1:05:31.333
I just don't want you to give up on your
dreams like your father did, that's all.

1:05:31.958 --> 1:05:34.791
But my father didn't
give up on his dreams, Mom.

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:39.375
Don't you remember? He had your dream!
My dream's also your dream!

1:05:39.458 --> 1:05:40.875
I always loved this place.

1:05:41.541 --> 1:05:43.375
I see you struggling here, Mom.

1:05:44.250 --> 1:05:46.208
Working hard and making little.

1:05:46.291 --> 1:05:48.041
But I love this place.

1:05:48.583 --> 1:05:49.583
I love it here.

1:05:51.375 --> 1:05:54.458
I'm just really worried
about your future, my son.

1:05:55.333 --> 1:05:57.500
My future is here by your side, Mom.

1:05:57.583 --> 1:05:59.875
Cutting hair here at Saigon.

1:05:59.958 --> 1:06:02.708
But don't worry. I'll continue to study.

1:06:03.291 --> 1:06:06.041
I will even take a course
that will teach me how to give

1:06:06.125 --> 1:06:08.250
our salon a total makeover, Ma!

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:11.625
"Our salon"?

1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:14.625
It's the same thing all over.

1:06:14.708 --> 1:06:16.333
Our salon, Mom.

1:06:17.083 --> 1:06:18.041
It'll be fine.

1:06:23.625 --> 1:06:24.791
I love you, Mom.

1:06:26.125 --> 1:06:27.583
I love you, Mom.

1:06:28.166 --> 1:06:30.041
I love you too, my baby boy.

1:06:32.250 --> 1:06:35.541
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-What's this about?

1:06:35.625 --> 1:06:37.958
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1:06:38.458 --> 1:06:40.875
What's going on here, Cristina?

1:06:40.958 --> 1:06:42.541
What's this, Jorge?

1:06:42.625 --> 1:06:45.958
Cristina, you can't leave the place
looking like this, come on.

1:06:46.041 --> 1:06:48.083
I thought what I said was clear.

1:06:48.166 --> 1:06:49.958
You haven't paid
your rent in months, Cristina.

1:06:50.041 --> 1:06:51.791
It's my right to find a new tenant.

1:06:51.875 --> 1:06:54.416
No, man. Come on, hold on a sec.
Hold your horses.

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:55.625
I was waiting for you.

1:07:00.875 --> 1:07:01.791
Here you go.

1:07:02.791 --> 1:07:04.416
Here's one month's rent.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000
Now, you don't need to evict anybody.

1:07:07.083 --> 1:07:09.291
-Yup, it's all here.
-Uh…

1:07:09.375 --> 1:07:11.125
You're a hit, kid.

1:07:11.208 --> 1:07:13.125
Now, come on, Jorge. We had a deal, yeah?

1:07:13.208 --> 1:07:15.666
You were gonna
give me the lease to the space.

1:07:15.750 --> 1:07:17.750
-And soon after--
-Yes, Greice Kelly, I hear you.

1:07:17.833 --> 1:07:19.000
But you know, quite frankly,

1:07:19.083 --> 1:07:22.250
I do have a long-standing
commercial relationship with Cristina.

1:07:22.333 --> 1:07:26.166
In fact, we're even contemplating
a potential commercial partnership, so--

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:29.625
No, no, no, that deal's
been off the table for a while now.

1:07:31.083 --> 1:07:34.666
Oh, also, I have acquired
a new business partner, Jorge.

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:36.500
Oh, yeah? Very well!

1:07:37.916 --> 1:07:38.916
Till next month!

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:44.125
-Excuse me!
-Greice?

1:07:45.375 --> 1:07:47.166
You look better with curls.

1:07:50.583 --> 1:07:53.291
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:56.791
Yo, fam!
Saigon is definitely back in business!

1:07:56.875 --> 1:07:59.083
Come on in, I'll cut everyone's hair!

1:08:36.041 --> 1:08:37.750
Oh, glory!

1:08:37.833 --> 1:08:41.041
-What's up, people?
-Hi, Carol!

1:08:41.750 --> 1:08:44.541
Oh, acclaimed one, you came through!

1:08:46.041 --> 1:08:48.875
Yes! A sister has come to the rescue!

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:52.333
I'm not your sister,
we've hooked up plenty of times, Josie.

1:08:53.916 --> 1:08:55.291
Uh, who's that?

1:08:55.916 --> 1:08:57.875
You gotta be kidding me, right?

1:08:57.958 --> 1:09:00.625
Don't tell me you don't know MC Carol!

1:09:00.708 --> 1:09:02.333
Who is MC Carol?

1:09:02.416 --> 1:09:04.416
It's Josias. Josias.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.500
And now the youth!

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:08.166
Enjoy yourselves, people,

1:09:08.250 --> 1:09:12.375
and please listen closely
to the word of the Lord, hallelujah,

1:09:12.458 --> 1:09:14.500
which inspires the masses!

1:09:14.583 --> 1:09:17.125
Right now it's inspiring
a very small mass, right, Josie?

1:09:17.208 --> 1:09:19.500
She's really speaking the truth!

1:09:20.208 --> 1:09:21.500
All right, believers.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.333
Where two or more are gathered,

1:09:24.416 --> 1:09:27.541
the Lord shall be there as well!

1:09:27.625 --> 1:09:29.041
Jesus is everywhere,

1:09:29.125 --> 1:09:32.208
at church, at the salon,
at the funky parties.

1:09:32.291 --> 1:09:34.291
Jesus loved parties, right, Josie?

1:09:34.375 --> 1:09:36.750
The first miracle Jesus did

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:39.416
was transform water into wine.

1:09:39.500 --> 1:09:42.250
Come on, people! Enough chit-chat, Josie!

1:09:42.333 --> 1:09:44.125
Let's go to the party, man!

1:09:44.208 --> 1:09:47.041
Wow, this church is empty!

1:09:47.125 --> 1:09:48.541
Come on! Come on, Josie!

1:09:51.666 --> 1:09:53.083
Ah, there you go.

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:55.208
She looks really stunning, Mom!

1:09:55.291 --> 1:09:57.125
Okay, it's ready, my dear.

1:09:57.208 --> 1:09:59.500
Oh, my God, Cristina, I love it!

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.500
-It's really good, Mom.
-Gorgeous!

1:10:03.583 --> 1:10:05.125
Escort me to the party?

1:10:05.750 --> 1:10:09.333
I have something important that I need to
finish up here. I'll meet you there.

1:10:09.416 --> 1:10:11.458
I'll finish my manicure
and then we'll meet there.

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.916
-Yeah, Big Head?
-All right, see you there. Bye.

1:10:18.916 --> 1:10:20.250
I saw that!

1:10:20.333 --> 1:10:23.458
-What, uh… What, Mom?
-You have a crush, huh?

1:10:23.958 --> 1:10:26.208
What do you mean?
It's not like that.

1:10:26.875 --> 1:10:30.541
I'm so, so, so glad
you didn't give up your dreams.

1:10:31.791 --> 1:10:32.958
I'd never give up, Mom.

1:10:34.875 --> 1:10:37.583
On that note,
isn't it time we made you glow?

1:10:37.666 --> 1:10:39.500
What? More than I already am?

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:40.916
Come on, I can do it.

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:44.333
-I just need to make a little effort.
-I'm sitting down. I'm tired.

1:10:44.416 --> 1:10:46.833
Just relax
while I cover you all over in glitter.

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:48.833
We're gonna make sure
you shine tonight, Mom.

1:10:48.916 --> 1:10:52.416
Look, I already know
what I'm gonna do and how, Mommy.

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:53.750
I trust you.

1:10:55.041 --> 1:10:57.708
Let's do this!
You're gonna glow tonight, Mommy.

1:10:59.791 --> 1:11:00.875
Okay, Mom.

1:11:01.666 --> 1:11:04.666
-What do you think?
-It's wonderful, son.

1:11:05.583 --> 1:11:08.166
-Wait, seriously?
-It's amazing.

1:11:09.958 --> 1:11:10.875
Just a second.

1:11:12.875 --> 1:11:15.000
I'll just clean up the counter real quick.

1:11:15.083 --> 1:11:16.541
-Okay, Mom?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:11:22.541 --> 1:11:24.750
Our love knew we had to wait.

1:11:24.833 --> 1:11:26.375
What is that, Richardsson?

1:11:26.458 --> 1:11:28.750
-Our hearts burning with desire…
-What? No idea.

1:11:28.833 --> 1:11:31.583
You're gonna have to
go out there and find out.

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:34.000
Just know that it's not my fault, okay?

1:11:34.708 --> 1:11:36.000
Maybe a little.

1:11:50.791 --> 1:11:52.458
I came to return this.

1:11:57.375 --> 1:11:58.875
You're still beautiful.

1:11:58.958 --> 1:12:00.291
You're not so bad.

1:12:00.375 --> 1:12:02.333
I love your hair. It's beautiful.

1:12:02.875 --> 1:12:04.250
It's your son's work.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:06.833
I learned from the best!

1:12:08.041 --> 1:12:10.250
-Shall we?
-I need to close the salon.

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:13.041
No, Mom.
Tonight, why don't you let me do it?

1:12:13.125 --> 1:12:14.708
You lovebirds have fun.

1:12:14.791 --> 1:12:16.916
-I'll see you at the party.
-Thanks.

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:29.041
Bye, Mom!

1:12:30.083 --> 1:12:31.208
Richardsson!

1:12:31.791 --> 1:12:33.291
-Mother Andinha!
-Oh, my boy!

1:12:33.375 --> 1:12:35.291
Your blessing, Mother.

1:12:35.375 --> 1:12:37.833
May Obatala bless you, my son.

1:12:38.791 --> 1:12:42.125
So I take it that you finally
found your own way, is that right?

1:12:42.708 --> 1:12:44.833
I found it. I think I found it.

1:12:44.916 --> 1:12:47.000
I did. I did, Mother.

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.833
I don't really know
how to explain it

1:12:49.916 --> 1:12:52.083
or how to show appreciation, Mother.

1:12:52.166 --> 1:12:55.458
We don't ever need
to explain things like that, son.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:57.000
Just feel it.

1:12:57.583 --> 1:12:58.875
Feel it, understand?

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:00.541
Good evening, Richardsson.

1:13:00.625 --> 1:13:03.250
'Sup, Pastor?

1:13:04.833 --> 1:13:08.541
-Good evening, Mommy.
-What are you doing here, my boy?

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:11.208
I didn't know
the service ended early tonight.

1:13:11.833 --> 1:13:13.833
-Well--
-But don't worry, my son.

1:13:13.916 --> 1:13:15.916
There's dinner at home, all right?

1:13:16.791 --> 1:13:20.208
Mommy, actually right now,
I'm going to find Jesus…

1:13:20.291 --> 1:13:21.500
at the party.

1:13:22.875 --> 1:13:24.000
Hey, Richardsson,

1:13:24.583 --> 1:13:27.416
I decided that I want to be closer
to the community.

1:13:28.250 --> 1:13:32.666
But you made me see
that it's important to listen more.

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:35.041
-Mmm.
-To hear more.

1:13:36.166 --> 1:13:38.291
We have two ears and one mouth.

1:13:38.375 --> 1:13:40.000
That's where it is, Pastor.

1:13:40.083 --> 1:13:42.333
Well, how about it, for the time being,

1:13:42.416 --> 1:13:45.750
I give you a rad hairdo in the name of JC.

1:13:45.833 --> 1:13:47.291
-How about it?
-Ooh!

1:13:47.375 --> 1:13:48.291
All right.

1:14:22.375 --> 1:14:24.208
Hey! Thank you, sir!

1:14:24.291 --> 1:14:27.833
A toast, my friend!
If you don't toast, it's bad luck.

1:14:28.458 --> 1:14:29.291
Dani!

1:14:29.375 --> 1:14:31.875
You scared me, Julinho! I'm done with you.

1:14:31.958 --> 1:14:34.958
I'm not doing my thesis
on the uptown anymore.

1:14:35.041 --> 1:14:37.291
-I realized--
-Okay, then what are you doing here then?

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:40.583
My thesis is on Leblon.
I came here to party.

1:14:40.666 --> 1:14:43.166
I won't take advantage
of your culture anymore.

1:14:43.250 --> 1:14:45.333
I want to live, to live like you.

1:14:45.416 --> 1:14:46.833
Mmm!

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:49.125
-Sounds good in theory.
-Yeah?

1:14:49.208 --> 1:14:51.500
-Let's see it in practice, okay?
-Sounds great.

1:14:51.583 --> 1:14:55.208
-I'll be observing you!
-We'll observe each other.

1:14:55.291 --> 1:14:58.000
Yeah, as long as
you know we're not dating.

1:14:58.083 --> 1:15:01.083
No, we're just seeing how it goes, right?

1:15:01.166 --> 1:15:03.666
Let's see how it goes.
Let's see how it goes.

1:15:03.750 --> 1:15:05.750
Let's see how it goes.

1:15:32.708 --> 1:15:34.833
Richardsson,
I wanna talk to you.

1:15:34.916 --> 1:15:36.833
-What about? Huh?
-What's up with you and Raquel?

1:15:36.916 --> 1:15:38.666
You and Raquel, what's your deal?

1:15:38.750 --> 1:15:40.875
I just… There's nothing going on, brother.

1:15:40.958 --> 1:15:43.208
-What do you mean, "going on"?
-There isn't.

1:15:43.291 --> 1:15:46.125
-She kissed me, brother--
-She did and you kissed back.

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:48.625
No! No! It's just that I… no, no.

1:15:48.708 --> 1:15:50.875
Well, now she's mad at you.

1:15:50.958 --> 1:15:53.041
-Huh?
-Raquel is mad at you now.

1:15:53.125 --> 1:15:56.458
Wait, she's mad at…
What about you? You're not mad?

1:15:56.541 --> 1:15:58.750
No. Oh, God.
We have an open relationship, man.

1:15:58.833 --> 1:16:01.833
-Open what?
-Relationship! She and I.

1:16:01.916 --> 1:16:03.541
Are you all right with it?

1:16:03.625 --> 1:16:06.166
Yeah, I'm all right.
I just don't understand it.

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:08.333
You and Raquel, Raquel and I…

1:16:09.375 --> 1:16:10.333
You and I?

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.875
No, no, unless… you're into that.

1:16:16.791 --> 1:16:18.125
Anyway, never mind, man.

1:16:18.208 --> 1:16:20.500
I'll just tell her you're not into it.
It's fine.

1:16:20.583 --> 1:16:22.250
-What do you mean by--
-What's up, guys?

1:16:22.333 --> 1:16:24.416
-What's up, Quel?
-Raquel, he's not into it.

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:25.541
-How come?
-How come?

1:16:25.625 --> 1:16:29.375
No, no, I didn't say I don't want to,
I just said I don't understand.

1:16:29.458 --> 1:16:30.541
Raquel, you're incredible.

1:16:30.625 --> 1:16:33.833
And I think you're the most beautiful,
most intelligent girl I've ever known.

1:16:33.916 --> 1:16:36.666
-And me?
-You, you're my bro!

1:16:36.750 --> 1:16:39.458
You're really handsome
and you're a great singer.

1:16:39.541 --> 1:16:40.750
I like you both!

1:16:40.833 --> 1:16:42.875
I just don't know how that works.

1:16:42.958 --> 1:16:46.250
Richardsson, I already date him.
We're totally game.

1:16:46.333 --> 1:16:47.833
What about you?

1:16:47.916 --> 1:16:50.541
Me? Uh, I'm game too!

1:16:50.625 --> 1:16:52.500
Well, it's official then, brother.

1:16:53.250 --> 1:16:54.958
I've gotta get ready for the show now.

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:57.333
-All right? Later.
-Go ahead! All right.

1:17:15.541 --> 1:17:17.541
Hold on, I have to take care of something.

1:17:17.625 --> 1:17:19.166
Okay, I'll get us some drinks.

1:17:35.125 --> 1:17:36.000
Thank you.

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:42.958
What's up, people?

1:17:45.708 --> 1:17:51.375
I'd like to welcome to the stage
MC Cheese Curd!

1:17:53.458 --> 1:17:56.583
What's up, everybody?
Let's tear this place down!

1:17:58.791 --> 1:18:02.958
Because here with me
is none other than Carol de Niterói!

1:18:05.916 --> 1:18:09.250
Now, let me say,
that hairdo is the shit, brother!

1:18:09.333 --> 1:18:10.958
You got it at Saigon, right?

1:18:11.041 --> 1:18:13.416
That's right!
My brother Richardsson did it!

1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:15.625
Thanks, bro!

1:18:20.291 --> 1:18:22.166
There's the man! There's the man!

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:25.791
Hit it, DJ!

1:18:57.958 --> 1:19:00.625
Hey, Cheese Curd!

1:19:00.708 --> 1:19:02.875
Let's burn the fucking house down!

1:19:02.958 --> 1:19:05.208
I'm Carol from Niterói!

1:22:08.583 --> 1:22:11.541
Richardsson, look!
Look what those two are doing!

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:16.083
-Which way? Like this?
-No, let's spin it this way.

1:22:16.166 --> 1:22:18.291
-Like this. Yes.
-To the left or to the right?

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:20.500
-Make up your mind.
-I think to the left.

1:22:20.583 --> 1:22:23.041
Yeah. Yeah, right there.
There we go, perfect.

1:22:23.125 --> 1:22:26.833
-Richardsson Pereira dos Santos.
-Richardsson? That's me.

1:22:28.333 --> 1:22:29.166
May I?

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:30.458
Yeah, of course you can.

1:22:30.541 --> 1:22:32.875
Don't get too comfy.
The party hasn't started.

1:22:33.666 --> 1:22:35.625
You know there's e-mail,
right, baby brother?

1:22:35.708 --> 1:22:37.791
This is the kinda stuff
they send through snail mail.

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:39.458
-Let me see.
-What is that, son?

1:22:39.541 --> 1:22:42.041
It says here,
"University of Teresa de Benguela."

1:22:42.125 --> 1:22:45.041
It's the confirmation letter
for my enrollment in college, Ma.

1:22:45.541 --> 1:22:46.666
I'm in.

1:22:47.416 --> 1:22:48.750
I can't believe it, son.

1:22:48.833 --> 1:22:51.625
Is it true, my son? My son! My son!

1:22:51.708 --> 1:22:53.083
I'm so proud!

1:22:53.166 --> 1:22:55.833
Everyone, Richardsson got into college!

1:22:57.958 --> 1:23:01.833
Ooh, if my Jura were here,
he would be so proud.

1:23:01.916 --> 1:23:05.125
He is, Espir. You know he is!

1:23:06.666 --> 1:23:09.333
Son. Look, son,
you know I don't like surprises.

1:23:09.416 --> 1:23:11.083
But I liked that one.

1:23:11.166 --> 1:23:13.291
Before I forget, everyone,
let's take a picture, quick!

1:23:13.375 --> 1:23:15.708
Celso! Go get Feathers!
Everybody hurry up!

1:23:15.791 --> 1:23:17.333
We're taking a picture! My phone!

1:23:17.416 --> 1:23:18.958
-You have one?
-No, use my phone.

1:23:19.041 --> 1:23:22.500
Wait! Everyone, just wait a minute!
What's this here, "M-R-S-E-M-R"?

1:23:22.583 --> 1:23:24.500
It means, "Mr. and Mrs.," Ma, it's fancy.

1:23:24.583 --> 1:23:26.250
-Oh, it's fancy?
-It's fancy, Ma!

1:23:26.333 --> 1:23:28.583
-Okay, if you say so.
-It was Julinho's idea.

1:23:28.666 --> 1:23:30.750
-I got Feathers!
-Let's take a picture!

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:32.833
To the future, right, Ma?

1:23:32.916 --> 1:23:35.375
The salon will be too small
for all the blessings.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:36.958
Picture!

1:23:37.041 --> 1:23:39.208
That's the subject
for another story, right?

1:24:53.750 --> 1:24:57.333
WE OFTEN CONQUER THAT
OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER DREAMT,

1:24:57.416 --> 1:25:00.875
BUT IT IS WHAT OUR FOREFATHERS
WISHED FOR ALL ALONG.
