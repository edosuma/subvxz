WEBVTT

00:05.586 --> 00:07.628
LISTEN, TYLER,
I GOT A CALL

00:07.628 --> 00:09.760
FROM YOUR TEACHER,
MRS. BROCKMAN,

00:09.760 --> 00:12.553
AND APPARENTLY, YOU
ARE GETTING A "D"
IN YOUR ENGLISH CLASS.

00:12.553 --> 00:15.686
YES, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET ON THE D's LIST.

00:15.686 --> 00:18.349
I THINK YOU MEAN
DEAN'S LIST.

00:18.349 --> 00:19.690
THAT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO GET A's.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.902
I KNOW. I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE LIST I STARTED

00:21.902 --> 00:24.145
FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL
LEFT OUT BECAUSE THEY
DON'T GET A's.

00:24.145 --> 00:27.448
WHAT GOOD IS SCHOOL
IF YOU CAN'T FEEL
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF?

00:27.448 --> 00:29.450
OKAY.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.282
LOOK, MRS. BROCKMAN AND I
DISCUSSED IT,

00:31.282 --> 00:33.494
AND WE CAME UP WITH A WAY
FOR YOU TO BRING UP YOUR GRADE.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.246
PLEASE DON'T SAY HOMEWORK.

00:35.246 --> 00:37.288
I LIKE TO KEEP MY HOME LIFE
AND MY WORK LIFE SEPARATE.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.620
CAN'T YOU RESPECT THAT?

00:39.620 --> 00:44.665
AFTER YEARS OF ACTING
IN THE SHAKESPEARE
IN THE PARK FESTIVAL,

00:44.665 --> 00:47.468
THEY ASKED ME TO DIRECT
THE PLAY OTHELLO.

00:47.468 --> 00:50.050
- THEY COULDN'T GET
ANYONE ELSE, COULD THEY?
- NO, THEY COULD NOT.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.882
THE POINT IS,
MRS. BROCKMAN SAID

00:51.882 --> 00:53.634
THAT IF YOU PERFORM
IN MY PLAY, SHE'LL
BRING YOUR GRADE UP.

00:53.634 --> 00:55.136
COME ON, TYLER,
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YA,

00:55.136 --> 00:57.728
AND A CHANCE FOR US
TO BOND.

00:57.728 --> 01:00.601
- YOU COULDN'T GET ANY GUYS
TO BE IN YOUR PLAY, COULD YOU?
- NO, I COULD NOT.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.603
AND IF YOU DON'T DO THIS,

01:02.603 --> 01:05.186
I MAY BE FORCED TO PLAY
ALL THE MALE ROLES MYSELF.

01:05.186 --> 01:07.778
HANG POSTERS
ALL OVER YOUR SCHOOL

01:07.778 --> 01:11.652
- OF ME IN TIGHTS SAYING,
"COME SEE TYLER'S DAD--"
- OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

01:11.652 --> 01:13.994
- COULDN'T THINK OF
A WAY OUT, COULD YOU?
- NO, I COULD NOT.

01:33.474 --> 01:35.386
OKAY, I THINK
THESE STREET RACING MOVIES

01:35.386 --> 01:36.767
HAVE PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT
OF VEHICLES TO USE

01:36.767 --> 01:39.640
WHEN THEY START DOING
HOT AIR BALLOON CHASES.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.773
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT LAST CRASH
WAS PRETTY EXCITING.

01:44.064 --> 01:47.228
Both: NO!

01:47.228 --> 01:49.360
BONK.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.362
WHAT DOES AVERY
SEE IN THIS GUY?

01:51.362 --> 01:53.404
CHARMING, UNASSUMING
PERSONALITY,

01:53.404 --> 01:56.327
KIND EYES AND SMILE
THAT LIGHTS UP A ROOM.

01:56.327 --> 01:58.539
BLAH! BLAH!

01:58.539 --> 02:00.831
COME ON, STAN.
EVERY TIME WES
AND I ARE TOGETHER,

02:00.831 --> 02:02.793
YOU TRY TO WEDGE
YOURSELF BETWEEN US.

02:02.793 --> 02:05.836
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S IN THE WAY.

02:05.836 --> 02:08.339
LET'S DO WITH HIM
WHAT WE DID WITH
LAST WEEK'S TRASH,

02:08.339 --> 02:10.421
UP UNTIL THE POINT
WHERE I ATE LAST WEEK'S TRASH.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.213
I'M NOT EATING HIM.

02:12.213 --> 02:13.884
I CAN'T WAIT TILL
WE GO TO SHAKESPEARE
IN THE PARK TOGETHER.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.676
ME, TOO.

02:15.676 --> 02:19.850
FINALLY SOMEONE SMART
I CAN TALK ABOUT
THE PLAYS WITH AFTERWARD.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.892
TOTALLY. BUT
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

02:21.892 --> 02:24.725
I LOVE SHAKESPEARE SO MUCH,
IT LEAVES ME SPEECHLESS,

02:24.725 --> 02:26.727
SO YOU'LL BE DOING
MOST OF THE TALKING.

02:27.728 --> 02:28.939
I SHOULD BE GOING.

02:28.939 --> 02:31.402
OH. PARTING IS
SUCH SWEET SORROW.

02:31.402 --> 02:36.076
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF
A WAY TO SAY GOOD-BYE
AND YOU JUST NAILED IT.

02:36.076 --> 02:38.199
OH, WAIT, THAT WAS
SHAKESPEARE, RIGHT?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.411
- OF COURSE.
- LOOK AT US.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.912
TALKIN' ABOUT HIM ALREADY.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.416
- SEE YA.
- SEE YA.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.250
( sighs )

02:49.250 --> 02:53.254
UGH! THAT DISPLAY BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU WAS DISGUSTING.

02:53.254 --> 02:54.845
I JUST THREW UP
A LITTLE IN MY MOUTH,

02:54.845 --> 02:57.508
WHICH I ENJOYED,
SO THANK YOU.

02:57.508 --> 03:00.721
STAN, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?
YOU'VE BEEN DOWN ON
WES FOR WEEKS.

03:00.721 --> 03:02.893
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
OFF ABOUT THAT GUY.

03:02.893 --> 03:04.515
I CAN'T QUITE
PUT MY FINGER ON IT.

03:04.515 --> 03:06.146
THAT'S BECAUSE NOTHING
IS OFF WITH HIM,

03:06.146 --> 03:07.768
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FINGERS.

03:07.768 --> 03:09.019
DON'T I?

03:10.981 --> 03:12.733
I'VE BEEN KEEPIN' THIS FOAM
FINGER CLOSE BY

03:12.733 --> 03:15.406
FOR OVER A YEAR
WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT.

03:15.406 --> 03:17.658
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

03:17.658 --> 03:21.412
AVERY'S SO CRAZY ABOUT
THAT GUY,

03:21.412 --> 03:22.783
BUT WES REALLY
RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY.

03:22.783 --> 03:24.495
LITERALLY.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

03:24.495 --> 03:25.996
THERE ARE INCORRECT WAYS
TO PET DOGS.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.640
THAT'S NOT PETTING.
THAT'S JUST...

03:39.640 --> 03:41.302
WHAT IS THAT?

03:41.302 --> 03:43.724
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:45.436 --> 03:47.107
I DID IT!
I DID IT, MOMMY.

03:47.107 --> 03:50.351
I MADE MY OWN BED
EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH.

03:50.351 --> 03:52.443
SO NOW I GET
MY OWN ROCK STAR RABBIT
GAME ON YOUR TABLET

03:52.443 --> 03:54.485
JUST LIKE YOU PROMISED.

03:54.485 --> 03:55.906
I DON'T REMEMBER
PROMISING THAT.

03:55.906 --> 03:59.199
IF YOU MAKE YOUR BED
EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH,

03:59.199 --> 04:01.492
YOU'LL GET YOUR OWN
ROCK STAR RABBIT GAME

04:01.492 --> 04:03.494
ON MY TABLET.
I PROMISE.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.166
THAT'S NOT MY VOICE.

04:06.166 --> 04:10.080
"I WILL NOT DENY THAT
THAT'S MY VOICE.
ELLEN JENNINGS."

04:10.080 --> 04:12.633
YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF ANYTHING.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.715
HOW DID YOU HOLD
ONTO THAT FOR A MONTH?

04:14.715 --> 04:16.086
I TAPED IT TO MY PERSON.

04:16.086 --> 04:18.509
- YOUR BODY?
- NO, MY PERSON.

04:21.842 --> 04:25.055
AS SOON AS THIS BAR LOADS,
YOU CAN PLAY.

04:25.055 --> 04:27.518
YES! ROCK STAR RABBIT
AND I ARE GONNA COLLECT

04:27.518 --> 04:29.440
SO MANY CARROTS.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.061
LUCKY, YOU JUST
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

04:31.061 --> 04:32.853
I WISH I COULD JUST
WORK ON MY NOVEL

04:32.853 --> 04:35.105
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M SECRETLY WRITING A NOVEL

04:35.105 --> 04:37.568
ABOUT A WOMAN WHO'S
AN AVERAGE HOUSEWIFE BY DAY,

04:37.568 --> 04:39.199
BUT A SECRET NOVELIST
BY NIGHT.

04:39.199 --> 04:41.201
HER NAME IS HELEN.

04:41.201 --> 04:43.994
- PERHAPS I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.
- NO, DON'T STOP.

04:43.994 --> 04:46.407
THANKS, HON, I LOVE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM
FOR THE CONCEPT.

04:46.407 --> 04:48.829
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE TIME TO WORK
ON MY NOVEL

04:48.829 --> 04:50.831
ONCE YOUR FATHER ASKS ME
TO HELP HIM WITH HIS PLAY.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.293
HE ALWAYS ASKS ME,
AND I ALWAYS SAY YES.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.466
- YOU KNOW WHY?
- 14 CARROTS!

04:55.466 --> 04:57.678
HA, I WISH!

04:57.678 --> 04:59.840
I HELP HIM BECAUSE
I LOVE HIM.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.473
I JUST HOPE THIS YEAR,
HE DECIDES HE DOESN'T
NEED MY HELP.

05:02.473 --> 05:05.766
I JUST HOPE THIS YEAR,
SHE DOESN'T INSIST
ON HELPING.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.888
THIS PLAY IS MY THING,
BUT SHE ALWAYS WANTS TO

05:07.888 --> 05:10.310
GET IN ON THE ACTION,
AND THEN I GOTTA FIND

05:10.310 --> 05:11.932
SOME BUSYWORK
TO KEEP HER HAPPY.

05:11.932 --> 05:13.934
- YOU KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS?
- ANOTHER LIFE!

05:13.934 --> 05:16.527
I WOULDN'T GO
THAT FAR, CHLOE.

05:16.527 --> 05:18.899
NO, I JUST HAVE TO
OFFER HER SOME SMALL TASK

05:18.899 --> 05:20.821
AND HOPEFULLY,
SHE'LL SAY NO.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.654
SO... YOU WANNA
FLUFF THE RUFFLES

05:23.654 --> 05:26.617
ON THE COSTUMES
FOR THE PLAY?

05:26.617 --> 05:29.540
OF COURSE I DO.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.664
THIS IS A CRAZY GAME.

05:33.664 --> 05:34.955
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

05:37.668 --> 05:39.720
HEY, STAN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:39.720 --> 05:41.341
ACTUALLY, I NEED YOU TO SAY,
"WHAT'S UP?"

05:41.341 --> 05:43.263
I HAD THIS WHOLE THING
WORKED OUT WHERE YOU SAY,

05:43.263 --> 05:45.846
"WHAT'S UP?"
AND I SAY, "SOMETHING BIG."

05:45.846 --> 05:47.347
SO GO AHEAD.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.730
OKAY. FINE.
WHAT'S UP?

05:49.730 --> 05:51.602
NOTHIN' MUCH.
AH, DANG IT.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.736
ANYWAY, I JUST
SPENT THE DAY

05:55.736 --> 05:58.108
FOLLOWING WES AROUND.
DON'T WORRY, HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.980
I WAS IN DISGUISE.

06:03.784 --> 06:06.156
NOTHIN' TO SEE HERE, FOLKS.

06:06.156 --> 06:09.620
JUST A DOG AT THE PARK LOOKIN'
FOR A LITTLE PICKUP GAME.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.833
PLAYED SOME COLLEGE BALL,
CAME OFF THE BENCH.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.995
DON'T WANNA INTIMIDATE
ANYBODY.

06:16.757 --> 06:18.999
IN RETROSPECT,
THE B-BALL DUDS

06:18.999 --> 06:21.001
MAY HAVE ATTRACTED
MORE ATTENTION THAN I WANTED.

06:21.001 --> 06:23.844
OR MAYBE IT WAS THIS.

06:23.844 --> 06:27.267
ALL DAY, AVERY,
ALL DAY.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.852
ANYHOO, I THINK YOU'LL FIND
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

06:31.852 --> 06:33.564
IN HERE.

06:36.186 --> 06:38.819
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SPIED ON WES.

06:38.819 --> 06:40.400
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING, STAN?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.732
THERE'S NOTHING EVEN
INCRIMINATING

06:41.732 --> 06:43.904
- ABOUT THESE PHOTOS.
- OH, YEAH?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.786
WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE OF HIM
ORDERING A SANDWICH?

06:45.786 --> 06:46.947
WHAT ABOUT IT?

06:46.947 --> 06:50.160
HE MISPRONOUNCED
MAYONNAISE.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.202
YOU'LL HAVE TO
TAKE MY WORD ON THAT.

06:52.202 --> 06:55.456
YOU KNOW WHAT, STAN,
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.669
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE
THAT WES IS A REALLY GOOD GUY?

06:58.669 --> 07:01.802
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO'S THIS HE'S SITTING NEXT TO?

07:01.802 --> 07:03.674
JUST SOME ATTRACTIVE
MYSTERY GIRL

07:03.674 --> 07:05.255
HE WAS TALKING TO
FOR A FEW HOURS.

07:05.255 --> 07:07.508
NOW CHECK OUT THE NEXT ONE.

07:07.508 --> 07:09.760
HE'S STEPPIN' ON
A CRACK.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.852
DOES HE NOT EVEN CARE
ABOUT HIS MOTHER'S BACK?

07:11.852 --> 07:14.144
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

07:14.144 --> 07:16.226
HE CAN'T BE WITH
ANOTHER GIRL.

07:16.226 --> 07:19.059
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

07:19.059 --> 07:21.021
GOOD. AND WHILE
YOU'RE THERE,

07:21.021 --> 07:23.614
PLEASE TELL HIM THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS "MAYNNAISE."

07:23.614 --> 07:25.866
IF YOU DON'T KNOW,
JUST SAY MAYO, DUDE.

07:28.829 --> 07:30.831
IF YOU ARE, LIKE,

07:30.831 --> 07:33.243
SO FOND OVER
HER INIQUITY,

07:33.243 --> 07:35.415
GIVE HER PATENT
TO OFFEND, FOR IF IT,

07:35.415 --> 07:37.498
YOU KNOW, TOUCH NOT YOU,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.630
IT COMES NEAR
NOBODY, YO.

07:42.292 --> 07:45.085
DON'T NORMALLY TAKE A BOW
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCENE

07:45.085 --> 07:48.759
AMONG MANY OTHER
UNIQUE CHOICES, YO.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.722
I KIND OF LIKE
THIS ACTING THING.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.724
I KNOW. ISN'T IT
EXHILARATING,

07:53.724 --> 07:55.766
CONNECTING ACROSS
THE CENTURIES

07:55.766 --> 07:57.057
WITH THE MIND OF
A BRILLIANT AUTHOR?

07:57.057 --> 07:58.859
NO, I JUST MEANT
IT COMBINES

07:58.859 --> 08:01.231
MY TWO BEST SKILLS--
LOOKING GOOD AND BEING OUTSIDE.

08:02.312 --> 08:04.525
HEY, WES.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.316
WHAT YOU BEEN
UP TO ALL DAY?

08:06.316 --> 08:07.738
JUST READING SOME SHAKESPEARE.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.531
SO YOU'VE JUST BEEN
SITTING HERE ALONE?

08:10.531 --> 08:13.994
ALL ALONE.
JUST ME AND MY BOY,
BILLY SHAKES.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.917
OH, REALLY?
THEN WHO'S THIS?

08:18.879 --> 08:20.751
HOW DID YOU GET THESE?

08:20.751 --> 08:24.715
NEVER MIND THAT.
WHO'S THIS HANDSY
LITTLE STRUMPET?

08:24.715 --> 08:26.086
OKAY, FINE.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.338
SHE WAS TEACHING ME
ABOUT SHAKESPEARE.

08:28.338 --> 08:30.300
I WAS EMBARRASSED
TO TELL YOU THAT

08:30.300 --> 08:32.593
I DON'T KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT THIS AS YOU DO.

08:32.593 --> 08:35.225
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I WAS STUPID WHEN WE SAW
THE PLAYS TOGETHER.

08:35.225 --> 08:37.227
LISTEN, I HAVE
FAKE TUTORED

08:37.227 --> 08:39.349
TO GET CLOSE TO
A GUY I LIKE--
DON'T ASK--

08:39.349 --> 08:41.311
SO I KNOW HOW
THESE THINGS GO.

08:41.311 --> 08:43.233
WHY DID SHE HAVE
HER HANDS ON YOUR HEART?

08:43.233 --> 08:46.066
SHE WAS JUST SHOWING ME
HOW THE IAMBIC PENTAMETER
RHYMING SCHEME

08:46.066 --> 08:47.608
MIMICS THE HEARTBEAT.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.910
IT DOES DO THAT.

08:49.910 --> 08:52.412
WAIT, THIS ALL
MAKES SENSE NOW.

08:52.412 --> 08:55.535
YOU WENT THROUGH
ALL OF THIS TROUBLE
JUST TO IMPRESS ME?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.919
AW, THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.

08:58.919 --> 09:00.961
SHALL WE TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU LEARNED?

09:00.961 --> 09:03.584
AVERY, YOU SPIED ON ME.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.217
I DON'T THINK I CAN
BE WITH SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T TRUST ME.

09:16.476 --> 09:18.599
STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.101
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

09:21.101 --> 09:22.442
STAN, WAKE UP.

09:22.442 --> 09:24.184
OH! HEY, AVERY.

09:24.184 --> 09:27.397
I WAS JUST HAVING THAT DREAM
WHERE YOU WERE THE BOSS OF ME,

09:27.397 --> 09:29.780
AND I WAS TOTALLY
COOL WITH IT.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.822
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT JUST HAPPENED

09:31.822 --> 09:33.654
BETWEEN WES AND ME
AT THE PARK?

09:33.654 --> 09:36.196
YES, I WAS SORT OF THERE.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.659
I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AS LAST TIME,

09:38.659 --> 09:40.621
SO THIS TIME, I WENT AS
A GOLFER.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.795
YOU COMPLETELY RUINED
THINGS WITH WES FOR ME.

09:44.795 --> 09:47.708
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE JEALOUS,
OR WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

09:47.708 --> 09:50.420
MY PROBLEM IS, IF I KEEP
SPLITTING MY TIME

09:50.420 --> 09:52.212
BETWEEN BASKETBALL
AND GOLF,

09:52.212 --> 09:54.214
I'LL NEVER GET GOOD
AT EITHER ONE.

09:56.056 --> 09:57.718
ROBERT, GRAB MY CLUBS.

09:57.718 --> 09:59.179
WE'RE GOING TO
THE DRIVING RANGE.

10:01.181 --> 10:03.483
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I BOTHER PRACTICING.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.435
BECAUSE SOMEDAY, I'M GONNA
HAVE A DRINK NAMED AFTER ME

10:05.435 --> 10:07.858
THAT'S HALF LEMONADE,
HALF TOILET WATER.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.029
NOW COME ON!

10:12.863 --> 10:15.365
SO, GETTING
YOUR LINES DOWN?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.947
YEP, I GOT 'EM
ALL DOWN,

10:16.947 --> 10:18.448
ON THE BACK OF THIS KID

10:18.448 --> 10:20.240
WHO STANDS IN FRONT OF ME
IN ACT TWO.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.083
IS THAT WHY INSTEAD OF
GOING WHERE I DIRECTED YOU TO,

10:23.083 --> 10:24.745
YOU JUST KEPT
FOLLOWING HIM
AROUND THE STAGE?

10:24.745 --> 10:28.208
THAT, AND HE SMELLS
LIKE WAFFLES.

10:28.208 --> 10:32.092
LOOK, TYLER,
ACTING IS NOT JUST
ABOUT LEARNING THE LINES,

10:32.092 --> 10:34.214
OR WRITING THEM DOWN
ON PEOPLE.

10:34.214 --> 10:38.849
IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING
HOW THE CHARACTER
THINKS AND FEELS.

10:38.849 --> 10:42.312
YOUR CHARACTER, IAGO,
SUCCUMBS TO JEALOUSY.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.645
OR, AS SHAKESPEARE
CALLED IT,
THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.479
YOU SEE, HE USED WORDS
IN NEW AND INVENTIVE WAYS.

10:49.479 --> 10:51.231
I GET IT.

10:51.231 --> 10:54.775
IT'S LIKE HOW I CALL
TACOS CRUNCHY MEAT BOATS.

10:54.775 --> 10:58.198
YES, SON, YOU ARE
THE SHAKESPEARE
OF YOUR GENERATION.

10:58.198 --> 11:01.832
THE POINT HERE IS THAT
IAGO WAS JEALOUS OF OTHELLO

11:01.832 --> 11:04.244
WHICH LED HIM DOWN
A VERY DARK PATH.

11:04.244 --> 11:06.626
AVERY SAID I WAS JEALOUS.

11:06.626 --> 11:09.379
SEE, IT'S JEALOUSY THAT
CAUSES PEOPLE TO HURT

11:09.379 --> 11:10.791
THOSE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.343
I CARE ABOUT AVERY,
AND I HURT HER.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.255
BUT I WOULD'VE KNOWN
IF I HAD DONE THAT.

11:15.255 --> 11:17.137
BUT THEY OFTEN DON'T KNOW
THEY'VE DONE THAT.

11:17.137 --> 11:19.559
( screams )
THAT'S ME!

11:19.559 --> 11:21.932
I'M JEALOUS OF AVERY'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH WES.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.394
GOTTA MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
PICK UP MY BALL, ROBERT.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.068
GUESS YOU WON'T BE
TEACHING ME LIFE LESSONS

11:28.068 --> 11:30.861
USING GOLF AS
A METAPHOR TODAY.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.864
IT ALL MAKES
SO MUCH MORE SENSE NOW.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.655
IT'S NOT JUST
A BUNCH OF WORDS

11:35.655 --> 11:37.948
I'M READING OFF
WAFFLE'S BACK.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.580
YOU'RE REALLY
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.661
PROUD OF YOU, SON.

11:41.661 --> 11:43.283
THANKS, DAD.

11:43.283 --> 11:44.875
I DIDN'T KNOW
WORKING WITH YOU
WOULD BE SO COOL.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.828
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN EXPRESS

11:47.828 --> 11:49.499
HOW MUCH THAT
MEANS TO ME.

11:49.499 --> 11:52.252
WE BOTH KNOW YOU CAN,
SO LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

11:52.252 --> 11:54.334
GET IT IN HERE.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.549
WELL, I GOT
ALL THE RUFFLES FLUFFED

11:59.549 --> 12:01.181
FOR YOUR FATHER'S PLAY.

12:01.181 --> 12:02.472
JUMP THROUGH THE HOOP.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.604
EXACTLY. YOU GET IT.

12:04.604 --> 12:06.767
I NEED TO GET BACK
TO MY SECRET NOVEL.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.690
HELEN'S FOUND THE HIDDEN
CHAMBER INSIDE THE HEART
OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.

12:10.690 --> 12:13.403
AND SHE'S NOT ALONE.

12:13.403 --> 12:15.986
LET'S HOPE YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
DUMP ANY MORE WORK ON ME.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.779
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DUMP
MORE WORK ON HER.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.740
SHE FLUFFED
ALL THE RUFFLES.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.663
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO KEEP HER BUSY FOR
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

12:23.663 --> 12:26.206
- NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE FOR HER TO DO.
- YOU CAN DO IT, ROCK STAR.

12:26.206 --> 12:29.249
WELL, I DO WHAT I CAN
TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.172
SO I FINISHED
THE RUFFLE FLUFFING.

12:32.172 --> 12:34.044
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.927
SO I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WANT
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

12:36.927 --> 12:38.718
SURE, IF YOU WANT.

12:38.718 --> 12:40.801
PRINT THE PROGRAMS?

12:40.801 --> 12:43.053
AGE THEM, ROLL THEM
ALL INTO SCROLLS?

12:43.053 --> 12:46.646
THAT'S THE PERFECT
USE OF MY TIME.

12:46.646 --> 12:49.599
UGH, TRAPPED IN A MAZE
AND CAN'T GET OUT.

12:54.895 --> 12:56.817
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:56.817 --> 12:59.820
AVERY, I REALIZE THAT
WES IS A GOOD GUY,

12:59.820 --> 13:01.952
AND I WAS JUST JEALOUS.

13:01.952 --> 13:05.115
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE FIXED IT.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.747
HI, WES,
IT'S AVERY'S COUSIN.

13:07.747 --> 13:10.710
UH... IAGO.

13:10.710 --> 13:12.873
YEAH, THAT'S MY NAME.

13:12.873 --> 13:14.464
IAGO?

13:14.464 --> 13:16.006
IT'S GAELIC.

13:16.006 --> 13:18.298
IT MEANS NOTHIN' WEIRD
GOIN' ON HERE.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.470
SO ANYHOO,

13:20.470 --> 13:22.722
I'M CALLING TO TELL YOU
AVERY HAD NOTHING TO DO

13:22.722 --> 13:24.554
WITH THOSE PHOTOS.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.766
I TOOK THEM BECAUSE
I'M VERY PROTECTIVE OF HER.

13:26.766 --> 13:28.478
AND JUST SO
THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS,

13:28.478 --> 13:30.810
I CAN CUT YOU A DEAL ON
A COUPLE OF 8X10's,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.853
SOME WALLET-SIZED,
MAYBE A BUTTON.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.564
THE HOLIDAYS
ARE COMING UP.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.816
DID HE BELIEVE YOU?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.698
AT FIRST, YES.

13:38.698 --> 13:39.900
AND THEN YOU
KEPT TALKING.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.282
AVERY, PLEASE,
I'M TELLING THIS STORY.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.244
SO ANYWAY, THEN
I KEPT TALKING.

13:45.745 --> 13:47.537
SO I'LL TAKE
THREE BUTTONS,

13:47.537 --> 13:50.710
THE 8X10, AND A PICTURE
OF ME ON THE COVER

13:50.710 --> 13:52.712
OF SPORTS HERO MAGAZINE.

13:52.712 --> 13:55.835
THAT'S ONE OF
MY BIGGEST SELLERS.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.338
SO I'LL GET ALL THOSE TO YOU
NEXT TIME YOU'RE OVER HERE.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.719
OVER WHERE?

13:59.719 --> 14:01.461
YOU KNOW, AT AVERY'S.

14:01.461 --> 14:03.133
YOU'RE STAYING
AT AVERY'S?

14:03.133 --> 14:06.346
I'M OVER THERE ALL THE TIME,
AND SHE NEVER MENTIONED YOU.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.518
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:08.518 --> 14:10.100
SO YOU MADE HIM
SUSPICIOUS?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.522
DON'T WORRY.
I INVITED HIM OVER

14:12.522 --> 14:14.604
SO WE CAN TALK IT OUT
IN PERSON.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.736
- STAN, WHY WOULD YOU--
- SHH.

14:16.736 --> 14:19.239
TRUST YOUR DOG.

14:21.281 --> 14:22.983
SO WHEN I COME OVER,
I CAN'T SEE YOU

14:22.983 --> 14:25.745
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN A FULL-BODY CAST

14:25.745 --> 14:27.197
FROM A HOT AIR BALLOON
CHASE

14:27.197 --> 14:28.748
JUST LIKE THE ONE
AVERY AND I RECENTLY SAW

14:28.748 --> 14:30.200
IN A MOVIE.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.832
YES. THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I JUST SAID.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.794
FULL-BODY CAST
FROM HEAD TO TAIL... TOE.

14:34.794 --> 14:35.996
TOE TO TAIL.
HEAD TO TAIL.

14:35.996 --> 14:37.497
WHOA, HOW'D IT
GET BACK THERE?

14:39.299 --> 14:40.710
FOR SOME REASON,
THAT LAST THING

14:40.710 --> 14:43.423
MADE HIM EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS.
BUT DON'T WORRY.

14:43.423 --> 14:46.176
WE'LL CLEAR IT ALL UP
WHEN HE'S OVER HERE TONIGHT

14:46.176 --> 14:48.098
TO SEE ME IN
MY FULL-BODY CAST.

14:48.098 --> 14:50.680
WHAT?! WHY WOULD YOU
INVITE HIM TO COME OVER TONIGHT?

14:50.680 --> 14:53.223
I COULDN'T HAVE HIM
COME OVER NOW.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.605
I'M NOT IN
A FULL-BODY CAST YET.

14:55.605 --> 14:56.856
USE YOUR HEAD, AVERY.

14:56.856 --> 14:59.019
- STAN, I--
- SHH.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.655
WELL, THAT'S 300 SCROLLS.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.867
THEY'LL BE LUCKY
IF 60 PEOPLE SHOW UP,

15:07.867 --> 15:11.491
- BUT IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.
- UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.453
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M LIKE
A PUPPET ON A STRING.

15:13.453 --> 15:16.376
DANCE, PINOCCHIO,
DANCE.

15:16.376 --> 15:18.168
LEFT, RIGHT,
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.379
ALL RIGHT, CHLOE,
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

15:19.379 --> 15:20.710
NO NEED TO BELABOR IT.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.802
I'M JUST GONNA
TELL YOUR FATHER

15:22.802 --> 15:24.174
THAT I CAN'T
HELP HIM ANYMORE.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.635
I NEED TO GET
BACK TO MY NOVEL.

15:25.635 --> 15:27.467
WHEN WE LAST LEFT HELEN,
SHE WAS ENCAGED

15:27.467 --> 15:30.600
IN THE ZOO AFTER HAVING
BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A PANDA

15:30.600 --> 15:31.972
AND I NEED TO REWRITE THAT,

15:31.972 --> 15:34.604
BECAUSE IT'S
INCREDIBLY STUPID.

15:36.816 --> 15:39.819
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR MOTHER FINISHED ALL THESE.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.771
THIS HAS GOTTA BE
LIKE, 300.

15:41.771 --> 15:44.734
WE'LL BE LUCKY
IF 60 PEOPLE SHOW UP.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.656
IF ANOTHER MUSICAL
NOTE DROPS FROM THE SKY,

15:46.656 --> 15:49.159
THE DRAWBRIDGE
WILL OPEN.

15:49.159 --> 15:52.832
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHLOE.
I SHOULD JUST TELL HER
I DON'T NEED HER HELP.

15:52.832 --> 15:56.076
- I CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.
- I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP ANYMORE.

15:56.076 --> 16:00.170
Both: YOU REALLY GET ME.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.173
EW, GROSS!

16:03.173 --> 16:05.505
CHLOE, THAT'S NOT
A VERY NICE THING TO SAY.

16:05.505 --> 16:07.087
I THINK SHE'S
TALKING TO THE GAME.

16:07.087 --> 16:10.720
NO. NO, I AM NOT.

16:14.184 --> 16:16.266
WHEN WES COMES
TO MEET IAGO--

16:16.266 --> 16:17.727
HEY, THAT'S THE NAME
OF MY CHARACTER--

16:17.727 --> 16:19.729
NOT IMPORTANT.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.102
WE'LL NEED A FULL-BODY CAST
LAYING ON THE BED

16:22.102 --> 16:24.234
WHILE STAN TALKS
FROM UNDER THE BED.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.695
SO TO MAKE
THE PLASTER CAST,

16:25.695 --> 16:27.697
I JUST NEED TO USE
YOUR BODY AS A MOLD.

16:27.697 --> 16:30.780
ONLY IF I CAN FILL IT
WITH GRAPE JUICE AFTER,

16:30.780 --> 16:32.162
AND PUT IT IN THE FREEZER
TO MAKE A LIFE-SIZED

16:32.162 --> 16:35.245
TYLER POP.
YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.

16:36.916 --> 16:39.119
OH, AND I HAVE TO BE
AT THE PLAY IN THE PARK TONIGHT,

16:39.119 --> 16:40.330
OR I'LL LET DAD DOWN.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.791
NOT A PROBLEM.
I'LL CUT YOU OUT

16:41.791 --> 16:43.253
IN PLENTY OF TIME
TO MAKE IT TO THE PLAY.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.175
AND DO I STILL GET
THE LIFE-SIZED TYLER POP?

16:45.175 --> 16:47.837
WELL, THIS WHOLE PLAN
IS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION
OF LIES,

16:47.837 --> 16:49.089
SO SURE, WHY NOT?

16:49.089 --> 16:50.720
SWEET.

16:54.804 --> 16:57.727
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
THE PLAY'S GONNA
START SOON.

16:57.727 --> 16:59.769
I THOUGHT THESE CLIPPERS
WOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO CUT IT.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.691
AVERY, IF YOU DON'T
GET ME OUTTA HERE
RIGHT NOW,

17:01.691 --> 17:03.233
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.605
TYLER, YOU LET
A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

17:05.605 --> 17:07.567
PUT YOU IN
A FULL-BODY CAST.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.739
SHOULDN'T YOU REALLY BE
MORE MAD AT YOURSELF?

17:11.611 --> 17:13.613
WELL, I GOT ALL
WES' PICTURES.

17:13.613 --> 17:15.825
HE WENT FOR
THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL PACKAGE,

17:15.825 --> 17:18.208
BUT I'M ONLY CHARGING HIM
FOR THE VALUE PACK.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.920
SEE, THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD
REPEAT BUSINESS.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.623
( phone rings )

17:23.623 --> 17:26.966
AVERY, THAT'S MY PHONE.
IT'S PROBABLY DAD CALLING.
WILL YOU ANSWER IT?

17:26.966 --> 17:29.339
I COULD, BUT I'M
KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.341
- BIGGER FISH.
- SHARKS, TUNA, GROUPER.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.842
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

17:32.842 --> 17:35.014
DON'T WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DEAL WITH?

17:35.014 --> 17:38.057
OH, COOL, ARE YOU MAKING
TYLER POPS?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.939
- I HEARD THIS MIGHT
BE HAPPENING.
- ( ringing continues )

17:39.939 --> 17:42.182
GET ME OUT OF
THIS STUPID CAST.

17:42.182 --> 17:43.813
AND SOMEONE PLEASE
ANSWER MY PHONE.

17:45.185 --> 17:47.237
YOU GOT CHLOE.

17:47.237 --> 17:49.649
THAT'S HOW THEY TALK
ON TV.

17:49.649 --> 17:51.401
CHLOE, WHERE'S TYLER?

17:51.401 --> 17:53.743
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE CAST.

17:53.743 --> 17:56.616
I THINK HE'S
THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE CAST.

17:56.616 --> 18:00.330
WELL, HE MAY FEEL THAT WAY.
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.622
HE CAN'T, HE'S TRYING
TO GET OUT OF THE CAST.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.414
CHLOE, HE'S PROBABLY
JUST NERVOUS.

18:04.414 --> 18:05.835
TELL TYLER
HE'LL DO FINE IN THIS CAST,

18:05.835 --> 18:08.007
AND EVEN BETTER
IN THE NEXT ONE.

18:08.007 --> 18:10.300
TYLER, DADDY SAYS WHEN YOU
GET OUT OF THIS CAST,

18:10.300 --> 18:12.262
HE'S GONNA PUT YOU
IN ANOTHER ONE.

18:12.262 --> 18:15.845
OH, MAN, HE'S REALLY MAD AT ME
FOR NOT BEING THERE.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.717
TELL HIM IT'S
NOT MY FAULT.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.639
HE SHOULD BLAME THE PERSON
WHO PUT ME IN THIS CAST.

18:19.639 --> 18:21.931
HE SAID YOU SHOULD BLAME
THE PERSON WHO PUT HIM
IN THE CAST.

18:21.931 --> 18:23.853
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE GOOD FOR HIM.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.686
I GUESS I SEE HOW IT WOULD
KEEP HIM OUT OF TROUBLE.

18:26.686 --> 18:28.488
JUST TELL HIM I'M SORRY.

18:28.488 --> 18:31.191
I REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD
THE ACTING ITCH.

18:31.191 --> 18:33.653
DADDY'S SORRY
YOU HAD THE ITCH.

18:33.653 --> 18:36.326
I DIDN'T HAVE AN ITCH
BEFORE YOU SAID IT,

18:36.326 --> 18:38.288
BUT NOW IT'S ALL
I CAN THINK ABOUT.

18:38.288 --> 18:40.620
SO ITCHY.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.832
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

18:42.832 --> 18:43.873
TYLER IS NOT COMING.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.296
I WILL BE PLAYING IAGO.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.458
WAFFLES, I NEED YOU TO
STAY CLOSE TO ME

18:48.458 --> 18:50.129
SO I CAN READ MY LINES
OFF YOUR BACK.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.634
- ( doorbell rings )
- MY GOSH, WES IS HERE.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.716
YOU HAVE TO STAY IN
THE CAST UNTIL HE LEAVES.

18:56.716 --> 18:58.017
I'M NOT PLAYING ALONG.

18:58.017 --> 19:00.220
I'LL MAKE NOISE,
I'LL SAY THINGS,

19:00.220 --> 19:01.641
I'LL TELL HIM I'M NOT
REALLY IAGO.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.223
IF YOU BLOW THIS FOR ME,

19:03.223 --> 19:05.645
TYLER POPS WILL NEVER
BE FULLY REALIZED.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.817
THEY'LL REMAIN A BEAUTIFUL,
LIFE-SIZED,

19:07.817 --> 19:10.980
ICE-COLD PURPLE APPARITION
THAT TAUNTS YOU FROM AFAR.

19:10.980 --> 19:15.655
CURSE ME FOR
DARING TO DREAM BIG.

19:16.776 --> 19:19.078
WES, THIS IS
MY COUSIN IAGO.

19:19.078 --> 19:22.161
WOW, GUESS YOU WEREN'T
LYING ABOUT THE BODY CAST.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.833
Stan: OF COURSE
I WASN'T LYING.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.336
WHO WOULD LIE ABOUT
BEING IN A BODY CAST,

19:26.336 --> 19:28.708
OR BEING A PHOTOGRAPHER,
OR BEING HUMAN?

19:28.708 --> 19:31.211
NOT THIS GUY.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.132
OKAY, SO HOW DID
THIS REALLY HAPPEN,

19:33.132 --> 19:35.174
'CAUSE I KNOW IT WASN'T
IN A HOT AIR BALLOON CHASE.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.297
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

19:37.297 --> 19:39.799
HE JUST TELLS PEOPLE THAT
BECAUSE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
WAS TOO EMBARRASSING.

19:39.799 --> 19:42.302
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE SLIP ON
BANANA PEELS IN CARTOONS?

19:42.302 --> 19:44.514
THAT IS WHAT HE DID.

19:44.514 --> 19:46.646
I WAS WATCHING
ONE OF THOSE CARTOONS,

19:46.646 --> 19:48.808
AND I LAUGHED SO HARD,
I FELL OFF MY ROOF.

19:48.808 --> 19:51.311
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.613
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHY I WAS WATCHING CARTOONS

19:53.613 --> 19:56.276
- ON THE ROOF.
- NOBODY'S WONDERING THAT.

19:56.276 --> 19:58.818
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN SEE MY NEIGHBOR'S TV.

19:58.818 --> 20:01.911
AND THAT EXPLAINS
EVERYTHING.

20:01.911 --> 20:05.164
YOU SEE, MY TV BROKE
IN A HOT AIR BALLOON CHASE.

20:05.164 --> 20:06.746
REALLY?

20:06.746 --> 20:09.629
OKAY, AVERY, I THINK
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

20:09.629 --> 20:11.791
- YOU DO?
- YOUR COUSIN
IS A LOON.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.834
NO, I'M NOT.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.507
A LOON IS A CANADIAN BIRD.
I'M AN AMERICAN HUMAN.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.889
- Tyler: OW!
- SORRY.

20:19.889 --> 20:22.181
Stan: OW!

20:22.181 --> 20:24.434
I THINK I JUST
HAVE TO ACCEPT
IF I'M GONNA BE WITH YOU,

20:24.434 --> 20:25.975
THAT CRAZY THINGS
ARE GONNA HAPPEN.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.439
WOULD YOU? THAT WOULD MAKE
THINGS SO MUCH EASIER.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.694
SO I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE PARK LATER
FOR THE PLAY.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.696
AH, DON'T FORGET
YOUR PICTURES.

20:36.696 --> 20:38.818
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

20:38.818 --> 20:40.620
YOUR FACE ON
A THROW PILLOW.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.952
PERFECT FOR GRANDMA.

20:42.952 --> 20:44.784
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PARK.

20:44.784 --> 20:47.577
AND I'LL TAKE
TWO PILLOWS.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.829
I'VE GOT TWO GRANDMAS.

20:51.581 --> 20:53.333
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING, AVERY.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.874
I DON'T KNOW HOW I LET
MY JEALOUSY

20:54.874 --> 20:56.506
GET THE BEST OF ME.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.967
DON'T WORRY, STAN.

20:57.967 --> 21:01.090
NO BOY IS EVER
GONNA REPLACE YOU.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.383
YEAH, THAT'S REAL NICE,

21:03.383 --> 21:05.725
BUT I'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
RIGHT NOW.

21:05.725 --> 21:07.597
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PUT
PHOTOS ON PILLOWS

21:07.597 --> 21:11.020
AND TWO MEMAS
ARE COUNTING ON ME.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.943
YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS?
THE PLAY IS GONNA
START ANY MINUTE.

21:13.943 --> 21:16.195
I HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

21:16.195 --> 21:18.738
TYLER, WAIT. WE'LL GET
DAD'S TOOLS FROM THE GARAGE.

21:27.407 --> 21:29.789
THAT'LL WORK, TOO.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.833
WHEN YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEONE,
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT PERSON.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.585
AND IF IT'S SOMEONE
LIKE AVERY,

21:35.585 --> 21:37.216
OR IN BENNETT'S CASE,
TYLER,

21:37.216 --> 21:38.878
THEY'LL COME THROUGH
FOR YOU.

21:38.878 --> 21:40.880
YEP, TYLER MADE IT TO
THE PLAY IN TIME.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.422
AND BENNETT WON
RAVE REVIEWS

21:42.422 --> 21:44.684
FOR HIS RADICAL
REIMAGINING OF IAGO

21:44.684 --> 21:46.636
AS A GHOST.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.275
TYLER EVEN GOT
HIS TYLER POP.

22:00.199 --> 22:02.241
ALTHOUGH SOMEONE
ATE THE HEAD.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.536
AND CHLOE REALLY
CAME THROUGH FOR ELLEN

22:06.536 --> 22:08.448
WHEN SHE NEEDED HELP
WITH HER NOVEL.

22:08.448 --> 22:11.250
HELEN IS STUCK ON
A SNOW-COVERED ISLAND
IN FINLAND,

22:11.250 --> 22:14.714
TRYING TO UNCOVER
A 50-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY.
BUT WHAT DOES SHE FIND?

22:14.714 --> 22:17.457
- A UNICORN!
- PERFECT!
