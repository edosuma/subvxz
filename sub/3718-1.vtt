MAN: What the hell
was that?

00:33.867 --> 00:34.535
[Dogs barking]

00:34.735 --> 00:36.170
What the...
What was that?

00:38.506 --> 00:41.041
Molly?
What did you do?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.177
Relax. It was just
half an M-80 this time.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.546
Look, I made a crater.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.081
You have to come
to see this.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.116
I layered the sediment,

00:49.016 --> 00:49.083
And the ejecta
looks exactly...

00:49.917 --> 00:49.983
It's 4:30
in the morning.

00:50.818 --> 00:50.884
I swear,
I have neighbors.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.053
Why are you
doing this now?

00:53.954 --> 00:54.655
For Geology.
It's due tomorrow.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.126
Or today in, like,
3 1/2 hours actually, and...

00:58.326 --> 01:00.194
I have to get up
in the morning.
Remember that?

01:00.394 --> 01:03.597
I swear, at least
just one time,
I'm begging you,

01:03.797 --> 01:05.065
Just let me sleep
through the night.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.368
[Chuckles]

01:07.568 --> 01:09.403
There's gas lines
and water lines
down there.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.738
I checked.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.107
You can't just randomly
do stuff like this.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.442
I checked.
What?

01:15.643 --> 01:16.844
I had the utilities
come out yesterday and mark,

01:17.811 --> 01:19.147
And he did a survey,
and he marked.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.214
Look, I'm not stupid.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.183
And how much
did that cost?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.385
I... They spread it out
over the bills.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.088
Look, I just... It just
took me a lot longer
than I planned.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.757
A lot longer, and...

01:33.327 --> 01:36.230
All right, I'm up now.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.631
Show me what you're doing,
Professor.

01:37.831 --> 01:41.669
I wanted
to recreate craters
from volcanic eruptions,

01:41.869 --> 01:43.271
And I had
to do it here,

01:44.438 --> 01:44.872
Because the sedimentary
deposits are exactly...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.308
You couldn't have just made
a baking soda volcano?

01:48.376 --> 01:49.377
Well, as sad as I know
it makes you, Dad,

01:50.278 --> 01:51.779
I'm not in third grade
anymore.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.315
[Rumbling]

01:54.515 --> 01:56.384
Get out of there,
Molly!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.820
[Grunting]

02:00.020 --> 02:02.690
Molly, get out of there!

02:02.890 --> 02:04.358
Ow! Ow!
No, no, no, no!

02:04.558 --> 02:06.894
I'm really stuck!
It's stuck! It's stuck.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.295
Pull!
I'm trying!

02:08.496 --> 02:09.497
I can't!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.199
Pull harder!
I'm trying!

02:11.399 --> 02:12.433
I'm trying!
Oh, God!

02:14.535 --> 02:16.837
[Gasping]

02:17.037 --> 02:18.339
The whole house
is coming down!

02:18.539 --> 02:20.208
Come on, baby! Pull!

02:20.408 --> 02:21.542
Pull!

02:24.612 --> 02:26.280
Dad, you gotta
get out of here.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.415
No! No!

02:27.615 --> 02:29.350
Get out of here!

02:29.550 --> 02:30.718
Come here.
Come here.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.325
Daddy!

02:37.525 --> 02:38.892
Daddy!

WOMAN: Hey, guys!

03:54.602 --> 03:55.936
Uh, okay, it looks like

03:56.136 --> 03:58.906
We'll be out of cell range
till Monday at least.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.674
Uh, most
of the San Andreas Fault

04:00.874 --> 04:02.009
Is pretty much
in the boonies.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.611
We're up near Paso Robles

04:03.811 --> 04:05.779
Putting in the next set
of sensors,

04:05.979 --> 04:07.515
And if all goes well,

04:07.715 --> 04:10.318
We'll have them all in
by tomorrow evening.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.321
And I cannot wait
to come home.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.688
I've missed you both.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.790
So good night.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.625
Bye.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.972
MAN: Molly? Molly,
where are you?

04:32.172 --> 04:33.441
Oh, another
all-nighter, huh?

04:33.641 --> 04:34.475
Science doesn't sleep.

04:35.309 --> 04:35.909
Heh.
But normal people do.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.278
I did.
I just got up early.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.280
Done.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.951
Yes!

04:44.151 --> 04:46.019
Ah, it was just
a bad power supply.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.790
All 19 sensors are
up and running perfectly.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.058
Make you some eggs?

04:51.258 --> 04:52.726
Oh, no, no, no.
I made breakfast.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.295
Wait. What? Heh.
Since when?

04:55.496 --> 04:57.765
Since I thought it
would melt the ice storm
with Miss you-know-who.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.066
I thought we could
all eat together.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.067
Oh, that's sweet,

05:00.934 --> 05:01.935
But I told you
I'm taking up

05:03.070 --> 05:03.637
A couple of lovebirds
at 8:00 this morning.

05:04.538 --> 05:04.972
I only got
a couple of minutes.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.674
What? When?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.710
Last night,
when you were futzing
with your iPad.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.413
Shoot!

05:12.613 --> 05:14.548
Maybe I should have
sent you a text message.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.749
No, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.585
I've been distracted.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.453
And working
a little too hard?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.788
No, look, I'm sorry.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.723
I'm just getting
really close. These swarms.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.627
You know, we've had
12 minor M1 quakes
in the last 72 hours.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.362
Something's up,
something big.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.831
I don't feel like I have
any time to waste.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.867
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.
I know you will.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.537
At least let me
get you some toast.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.440
Oh.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.841
You like yours
well done, right?

05:41.041 --> 05:42.776
[Chuckles]
Perfect.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.380
Is Ali awake?

05:46.580 --> 05:47.848
I made
her favorites,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.751
French toast
with mascarpone
and turkey sausage.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
You know
how to make all that?

05:53.153 --> 05:56.089
No, but there's these
wonderful little books
that I found

05:56.289 --> 05:57.791
With step-by-step
instructions.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.528
Cooking books,
I think that's
what you call them.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.695
She'll come around.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.363
I hope so.
Eventually.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.098
Stepmoms are
no competition

06:05.298 --> 06:07.568
For the influence
of a new boyfriend.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.769
Mm.

06:09.803 --> 06:10.938
I figure when
that relationship ends,

06:12.205 --> 06:14.542
And I hope soon,
that she'll turn
to me again

06:14.742 --> 06:17.478
And I could convince her
to go back to school.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.479
Mm-hmm.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.548
[Beeping]
Oh.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.815
[Sighs]
Just a minute.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.150
Right.
Hold on.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.152
Morning, Ali.
I made you
breakfast.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.755
Dad. Molly.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.122
Really?
Hank.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.559
Thanks,
but I gotta run.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.595
But it's French toast
with mascarpone.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.063
Trying to watch
what I eat,

06:36.263 --> 06:37.798
All that sugar and carbs.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.933
Oh, please.
You're a rail.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.502
I gotta jet anyway.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.736
You know
how long it takes

06:42.936 --> 06:44.004
To get from Rosemead
to downtown?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.606
Why do we even live here?

06:46.874 --> 06:47.675
Because Rosemead
sits on a giant slab
of granite,

06:48.542 --> 06:48.876
And that's
exactly where you

06:49.943 --> 06:50.611
Want to be
when an earthquake
strikes.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.913
Well, it's not where you
want to be when you're 18.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.182
Well, why don't you
have your boyfriend
over here?

06:55.949 --> 06:56.584
We can
all have dinner.

06:57.585 --> 06:57.918
There's no boy.
See you later, Dad.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.655
You think
your passengers
want breakfast?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.957
[Chuckles]
I have plenty.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.427
Put it in the fridge.
I'll have it for dinner.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.598
And for one day, try to
not think of earthquakes.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.568
ANCHOR:
A series of minor temblors

07:14.768 --> 07:16.770
Causes jitters
throughout the Southland.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.506
Two dozen tiny earthquakes

07:18.706 --> 07:21.208
Registering 1.0
on the Richter Scale or lower

07:21.408 --> 07:24.478
Has seismotologists scratching
their heads this morning,

07:24.678 --> 07:26.814
While the string
of temblors seems to have gone

07:27.014 --> 07:29.016
Largely unnoticed
for most Los Angelenos.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.619
We'll check in with Tippi Santos
at Venice Beach,

07:31.819 --> 07:34.488
And your weather report
from Kaz.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.158
MOLLY: Okay, now with
this final piece in place,

07:38.358 --> 07:40.594
All 19 sensors
along the entire fault line

07:40.794 --> 07:41.795
Are gonna start
pinging each other,

07:42.863 --> 07:43.997
And the system
is gonna crunch that data

07:45.098 --> 07:46.500
And send me back reports.
And when we take

07:48.001 --> 07:49.970
All the data streams
from all the sensors,
we get this. Danny?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
Hold on
to your butts.

07:52.239 --> 07:56.009
Each sensor monitors
microseismic activity,

07:56.209 --> 07:58.612
And that's the changing
ratio between sheer waves

07:58.812 --> 08:01.481
And pressure waves
within a 50-mile radius.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.518
Real-time monitoring?
That's nothing new.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.019
No, not just
real-time monitoring.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.055
Predictive extrapolations

08:08.255 --> 08:09.857
For all
microquake activities

08:10.057 --> 08:11.992
Along the entire
San Andreas Fault.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.663
See these white circles?
They're microquakes.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.666
Can anyone tell me
the importance
of the microquake?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.702
Well, they're important,
because...

08:21.902 --> 08:23.103
Because some
theorize they could be

08:23.303 --> 08:24.104
Good predictors
for foreshocks

08:24.938 --> 08:26.139
Or even quakes
themselves.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.075
And if we were
in the business

08:28.275 --> 08:29.643
Of predicting earthquakes,
the microquake

08:29.843 --> 08:31.679
Would be
our best source of data.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.548
But it can't be done,
'cause it's
not possible.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.515
What can't?
Predicting quakes.

08:38.085 --> 08:38.952
Well, that might be true,
but I happen to believe
that it can be.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.221
Yeah, and how'd
that work out
for you in 2008?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.823
[Giggles]

08:44.024 --> 08:45.025
[Sighs]

08:45.225 --> 08:48.228
Well, someone's done
their homework for once.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.130
Yes, I was wrong.
I guess you could say

08:50.330 --> 08:52.633
I acted before I had
all the data. I was hasty.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.134
But this is different.

08:54.334 --> 08:54.935
Here's the catch.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.304
See these white circles?

08:57.504 --> 08:58.639
They're microquakes,

08:59.539 --> 08:59.907
And they haven't
happened yet.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.108
But I will bet you

09:02.042 --> 09:02.676
Dollars to doughnuts,
they will,

09:03.711 --> 09:04.845
And in an hour's time,
to be specific.

09:05.813 --> 09:06.880
And in predicting
the microquake,

09:07.881 --> 09:08.816
We can further
extrapolate that data

09:10.050 --> 09:11.885
Into exponentially bigger,
more timely predictions.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.887
[Scoffs]
I don't buy it.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.890
And that's all the time
we have for today.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.926
Come get
your graded field reports.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.027
Really good job, everybody.

09:20.928 --> 09:21.294
And if you have
any questions,

09:22.262 --> 09:22.963
I'll be in the campus café,
okay?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.949
All right.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.216
Come on.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.685
[Sighs]

09:44.885 --> 09:45.953
Show me
something good.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.758
I deserve an "A."
What?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.860
I need it.
I could lose
my scholarship.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.127
You should have
studied more.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.328
I'm trying, okay,

09:56.396 --> 09:57.665
But do you know
how many classes I have,

09:57.865 --> 09:58.999
How much I have to read?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.668
I'm working
all the time.

10:00.868 --> 10:01.969
"A" students
make the time.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.307
I have a problem with
know-it-all students who
show a lot of promise

10:07.507 --> 10:10.377
And squander it all away
on girls and drinking.
I know your type.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.745
You read
"On the Road" once,

10:12.780 --> 10:13.380
And suddenly you have
all the answers.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.348
I'm not seeing
a lot of girls.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.317
I might just be
a teacher, but I hear
all the gossip.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.120
And that's great.
You should be
having fun.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.388
But just because
you're smart, Nick...

10:22.489 --> 10:23.190
[Cellphone ringing]
And you really are.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.993
I can see
what you're capable of
when you actually try.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.261
But it doesn't mean
you don't have
to do the work.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.629
[Ring]

10:29.830 --> 10:31.832
Now excuse me.

10:32.032 --> 10:32.833
Hey.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.134
Hey. You okay?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.302
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a student.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.037
Same old, same old.
Any word from Ali

10:38.005 --> 10:38.806
On her first day
at the front desk?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.341
You know Ali. She's probably
running that hotel by now.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.243
She can fend
for herself.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.978
Too true.
You taking off yet?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.246
I'm gassing up right now.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.748
Hey, how was
the field trip?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.983
It was fine, except for

10:50.183 --> 10:51.852
The aforementioned student
brought up 2008.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.121
Ah, forget 2008.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.389
Remember that Edison
failed, like, 10,000 times

10:56.589 --> 10:58.025
Before he invented
the lightbulb, right?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.761
You mean,
before he stole it
and patented the idea?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.095
[Chuckles]
I'm just nervous.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.732
I'm waiting on some data
to come in.

11:04.932 --> 11:05.733
[Beeping]

11:05.933 --> 11:08.068
Oh, my God.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.203
What is it?
Oh, my God!

11:10.403 --> 11:12.405
What's going on?
Oh, my God, Hank!

11:12.605 --> 11:13.807
Molly, tell me
what's happening.

11:14.007 --> 11:14.908
It's working!

11:15.776 --> 11:16.443
It's really,
really working.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.311
Hank, oh, my God!
What is?

11:19.279 --> 11:19.847
The microquakes
that I predicted.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.782
The pressure,
the velocity, the slip,

11:22.649 --> 11:23.116
You name it,
it's happening!

11:23.784 --> 11:24.818
That's great, right?

11:25.953 --> 11:27.020
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.257
I gotta call
that smug S.O.B.
over at Caltech.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.358
I love you.

11:32.325 --> 11:32.826
I love you, too.
Yeah, go, go, go.

11:33.693 --> 11:33.761
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.364
Professor Dunn?

11:37.564 --> 11:38.365
Yeah, look at that.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.432
Those green dots,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.101
Confirmed predictions.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.171
That's 45 to 63 minutes
in advance.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.205
That's incredible.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.406
It's more
than incredible.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.275
It's...
[beeping]

11:50.110 --> 11:52.846
Oh, no.
Oh, I was worried
about the swarm.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.214
Something's up.
What?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.917
Look.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.385
It's big,
and it's close.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.087
You're saying that's
gonna hit in two minutes?

12:00.287 --> 12:02.155
The microquakes,
this system

12:02.355 --> 12:05.725
Had 97.7% accuracy
in predicting them.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.838
Oh.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.908
We've gotta
get everybody out.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.910
NICK: Are you sure?
I mean,

12:23.110 --> 12:24.878
Where are you getting
this confirmation data from?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.379
Yes, I'm sure.
Straight from the USGS.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.248
But have you checked
the raw data yet?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.350
Miss, we have
to get everyone

12:30.550 --> 12:32.252
Out of the restaurant.
Huh?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.421
We are about to have
an earthquake.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.289
Okay.
I have to talk

12:36.489 --> 12:37.457
To my manager
about that.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.026
Look, Professor Dunn,
I'm sure everything

12:39.226 --> 12:40.160
Is gonna be okay,
all right?

12:41.094 --> 12:41.161
There's nothing
to worry about.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.330
[Cellphone ringing]

12:48.401 --> 12:51.471
Gun! Gun!
He's got a gun!

12:51.671 --> 12:53.040
Everybody out!
He's got a gun!

12:53.240 --> 12:54.141
Hey, hey, wait!
I'm... What?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.343
GIRL:
Get out!

12:56.543 --> 12:58.145
It didn't happen.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.013
No, no, no,
it's okay!
I don't have a gun!

13:00.213 --> 13:01.014
Hands against the wall!
[grunts]

13:02.682 --> 13:04.084
I said
I don't have a gun!

13:04.284 --> 13:05.452
No, no, no, he doesn't
have a weapon.

13:09.122 --> 13:09.890
No, no, no.
Sir, sir, I'm sorry.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.191
He does not
have a weapon.

13:12.025 --> 13:12.092
Really,
I made a mistake.

13:12.893 --> 13:13.961
He doesn't
have a weapon.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.963
I made a mistake.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.832
You're clean.
Yeah.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.868
Confirm for me, ma'am.
There is no one
with a weapon?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.802
No, no one.

13:23.003 --> 13:23.871
With a weapon?

13:24.071 --> 13:25.172
No one
with a weapon.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.173
I'm sorry.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.342
Cancel code red.
False alarm.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.411
I repeat, false alarm.
Sir, I'm sorry.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.180
I was just trying
to get everyone out.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.982
Okay, we don't joke
about this at all.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.483
You know how much paperwork
I gotta fill out?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.253
I thought...

13:40.453 --> 13:41.922
I thought there was
gonna be an earthquake.

13:42.122 --> 13:42.990

just run into a building
in the middle of a quake!

14:02.609 --> 14:03.944
[Screams]

14:05.078 --> 14:06.146
You have to assess
the structural integrity...

14:23.296 --> 14:25.198
You okay?
Yeah.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.934
I'm fine.
Thanks.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.609
Bet it's a lot different
from Iowa, huh?

14:36.809 --> 14:38.912
Yeah. Well,
Roy's never seen the ocean.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.547
I was in the Army,
so I've seen a lot,

14:40.747 --> 14:43.083
But not much
was this breathtaking.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.086
Look at those boulders!

14:46.286 --> 14:47.487
Does that
happen a lot?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.023
Whoa.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.393
Control, this is
Bell Four Delta Chaz.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.929
I'm witnessing
a major rockslide event

14:56.129 --> 14:57.064
East of Point Mugu.

14:57.998 --> 14:58.631
Oh, man,
it's taking down houses

14:59.366 --> 14:59.666
And high-tension wires.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.134
Possible injuries.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.136
Notify emergency
services immediately.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.337
Oh, my God.

15:05.405 --> 15:05.472
[Radio] Roger that,
Bell Four Twelve.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.307
We're on it.
That's an earthquake.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.009
We're getting shook up
pretty good down here.

15:09.943 --> 15:10.543

up there for a moment.

over to Malibu Creek. Over.

Excuse me, guys.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.419
I need to make
a quick call.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.590
Ali, it's Dad.
Are you okay?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.165
What are you
so happy about?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.467
4.7 magnitude.
I was dead on.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.204
[Cellphone ringing]
I mean, off by a minute,

15:37.404 --> 15:38.938
But, hell, close enough.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.607
Hank, are you okay?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.042
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.310
We could see
the shaking

15:43.510 --> 15:44.244
From up here.
Are you okay?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.645
Yeah. How's Ali?
She's fine.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.047
I just talked
to her.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.582
Actually,
everything's great.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.584
My system gave me
over three minutes
warning.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.686
I was able to get
everyone to safety
before it struck.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.055
Thank goodness.

15:56.089 --> 15:56.156
So much for
no earthquakes today, huh?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.458
[Chuckles] Right.
Tell me about it.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.493
How'd your buddy Chet
take it?

16:01.594 --> 16:02.229
Oh, my God. I haven't
even called him yet.

16:03.096 --> 16:03.463
Everything happened
so fast.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.067
Well, make sure you
be careful, all right?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.069

16:15.342 --> 16:17.244
Hank, oh, my God.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.545
We've gotta get Ali
and get out of town.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.280
What are you
talking about?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.550
All the data
from the sensors
confirm it.

call Wednesday.

Residents in Malibu and parts
of Pacific Palisades today

Are reporting moderate damage
and no injuries after what...

[Sirens blaring]

16:53.280 --> 16:54.614
A hundred years old?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.316
I thought this place
was new.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.584
How can that be safe?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.152
Sir, I assure you,

17:00.387 --> 17:00.787
The hotel has
been retrofitted
for earthquakes.

17:01.821 --> 17:02.689
I know it looks
threadbare right now,

17:03.723 --> 17:04.656
But we do plan
to refurbish next year.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.061
No, no. I need
a lower room at least
near an exit.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.263
Ooh. [Chuckles]
I always said

17:11.464 --> 17:13.766
The first time
Arnie and I kissed,
the Earth moved.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.736
Glad to see
we haven't lost
our touch.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.070
So it was your fault.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.571
Well, no more,
please.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.209
I see you
had a productive time
shopping.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.510
That's a beautiful
necklace.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.811
Oh, you're a dear.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.480
Rubies are
for the 40th,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.150

prefer diamonds.

I don't usually
shop like this,

our anniversary.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.159
That's right.
You told us.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.160
That is
so wonderful.

Oh, you know,
we shared

right over there.

change.

please hold our bags

have a quick bite?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.808
Absolutely.

such a cute couple.

help you, sir.

to have to leave work.

out of town now.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.248
[Tone chimes]

19:09.916 --> 19:10.650
Hank?
I'm here.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.285
The call must
have dropped.

19:13.320 --> 19:13.386
I'll try her again.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.522
What if the cells go down?
What should we do?

19:16.423 --> 19:17.757
What?
Molly, can you hear me?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.726
We've gotta
get out of here.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.262
This is going to be
exponentially bigger
than what we just felt.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.697
The entire grid
is going to fall.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.698
Ali.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.670
I'm gonna go get her.
No, wait. I'll get her.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.705
You won't have enough time
to get out of the city.

19:32.905 --> 19:33.773
Okay, Molly?
Hank?

19:34.707 --> 19:35.242
Molly, can you hear me?
Listen.

19:36.309 --> 19:36.743
Honey, I don't have
enough time or fuel

19:37.410 --> 19:38.611
To get you and her.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.582
Get Ali!

19:44.050 --> 19:44.817
I'll see you there.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.853
Meet us on top
of her building.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.321
That's just
what I was gonna say.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.422
I was thinking
the same thing.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.725
In 80 minutes.
No later, Hank.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.394
Molly? Molly!

19:54.594 --> 19:55.495
Hank?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.963
Molly. Shit!

19:57.163 --> 19:58.498
Little detour, folks.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.500
We're gonna have to stop
and get some gas.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.808
[Tone chimes,
busy signal beeping]

20:09.008 --> 20:09.809
Shit!

20:10.643 --> 20:12.845
Hank, you better
get there.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.814
Ali, you better stay put.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.816
[Sirens blaring]

20:19.786 --> 20:21.654
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Ron Jantz,

20:21.854 --> 20:22.989
And this is 10 Action News

20:23.189 --> 20:25.725
Bringing you the latest
on the earthquake activity.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.728
We've got our team live
at the USGS facilities,

20:28.928 --> 20:31.998
And from what we understand,
they are about to start

20:32.198 --> 20:34.834
Their news conference
at any minute.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.536
Okay, here we go.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.639
We estimate it to be
a 5.1 earthquake

20:39.839 --> 20:41.774
With an epicenter in Malibu.

20:41.974 --> 20:42.909
In all likelihood,

20:43.876 --> 20:44.711
There will be
minor aftershocks...

20:48.047 --> 20:50.450
Do you have a phone,
a landline?

20:50.650 --> 20:51.818
Is it local?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.320
It's an emergency.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.792
Come on, Ali.
[busy signal beeping]

20:59.992 --> 21:01.027
Damn it.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.697
[Line rings]

21:04.897 --> 21:06.999
Our seismologists
will be reviewing

21:07.199 --> 21:08.501
The data more thoroughly,
[telephone ringing]

21:08.701 --> 21:09.602
But at this time,

21:09.802 --> 21:11.003
We estimate it to be...

21:11.203 --> 21:12.639
Caltech Geological Survey.
This is...

21:12.839 --> 21:13.773
Chet,
it's Molly Dunn.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.676
Oh, hey, Molly.
You okay?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.811
I heard
that last quake hit
a little close to you.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.781
Cell towers
are going down,

21:22.682 --> 21:23.683
And I don't know
the next time

21:25.117 --> 21:25.184
I'll be able to get
to a landline or how
long they'll last,

21:26.052 --> 21:26.786
So you have
to listen to me.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.322
We have got to enact
a level-four evac.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.358
This is
going to be big,

21:31.558 --> 21:33.360
Upwards of a M10,
Chet!

21:33.560 --> 21:35.395
Molly, Molly, please.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.465
My system works, Chet.
It knew about Malibu

21:38.665 --> 21:40.433
Four minutes
before it happened.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.868
Molly...
And now I'm showing

21:43.169 --> 21:44.637
No fewer
than 18 right lateral
strike-slip warnings

21:44.837 --> 21:46.305
On 19 of my units

21:47.607 --> 21:49.576
Up and down
all 800 miles of
the San Andreas, Chet.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.744
Yeah, and in 2008,
you said the same thing.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.813
Only, it turned out
to be dune buggies
and high wind.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.848
That was eight million
lines of code,

21:56.048 --> 21:57.584
Chet, your code!

21:57.784 --> 21:59.619
These are new rigs,
new code,

21:59.819 --> 22:00.920
And it's working!

22:01.120 --> 22:02.855
A level-four evac, Molly?

22:03.055 --> 22:05.358
You have any idea
what I'd have to do?

22:05.558 --> 22:08.027
Will you just look
at my data? Please?

22:09.095 --> 22:10.563
All right, fine.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.732
Send it over to me.
I'll take a look at it.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.434
I did! Check your inbox.

22:15.802 --> 22:16.536
We have got
to pull the trigger
on this evac protocol.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.005
You want me to evacuate
13 million people

22:20.206 --> 22:21.741
Because your science project
made a lucky guess?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.543
That's not good science.
It's...

22:23.743 --> 22:26.679
An M10, Chet.
Listen to me.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.981
I... I gotta go.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.850
There will be
minor aftershocks,

22:31.050 --> 22:32.251
But if any do occur,

22:32.452 --> 22:35.555
The frequency of these events
should taper off quickly.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.590
[Slams receiver]
Damn it.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.870
Oh, no, no, no!

22:51.070 --> 22:51.971
Professor Dunn?
Shit.

22:52.872 --> 22:53.906
Nick, I'm sorry
about earlier,

22:54.841 --> 22:55.675
And I'm sorry
about the grade,

22:56.876 --> 22:56.943
But I really don't have
time for this right now.

22:57.710 --> 22:57.777
No, no. How's Ali?
Huh?

22:58.411 --> 22:59.512
Ali. Is she okay?

23:00.146 --> 23:00.547
Yeah, she's fine.

23:01.380 --> 23:01.714
I can't
get ahold of her.

23:02.582 --> 23:02.882
Did she leave
the hotel yet?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.585
She's so stubborn.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.854
You're Ali's boyfriend.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.489
I wanted to be
up-front about it.

23:09.689 --> 23:10.890
She made me swear
not to tell.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.625
She said
you'd disapprove.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.127
Yeah, she's right.
Excuse me.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.395
Are you gonna
go get her?

23:16.596 --> 23:17.630
I am.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.566
You need a car, right?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.400
Yes, I will.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.436
We can use mine.
"We"?

23:23.636 --> 23:24.904
Or I can go on my own.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.607
If you think you can
get there before me,
be my guest.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.842
All right,
where's your car?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.444
Over here.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.783
Oh, you can't
be serious.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.117
She'll get us there.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.590
All right. Take PCH.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.825
We should stay off
the elevated freeways.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.934
Uh...

23:55.134 --> 23:56.536
Yeah, just go.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.986
[Sirens blaring]

24:17.323 --> 24:19.792
Lobby looks good.
I see no damage here,

24:19.992 --> 24:22.495
Not even a crack.
Meet me in the ballroom.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.565
Uh, that was
quite a little shaker
we had there.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.767
Um, is everything
looking okay? I mean...

24:27.967 --> 24:29.502
Yeah, that's actually
pretty old.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.637
It's nothing new.

24:31.538 --> 24:31.904
Everything's
checking out fine.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.976
Whoo-hoo! [Chuckles]

24:38.711 --> 24:41.113
Oh, the technology today.

24:41.313 --> 24:45.818
When I was a kid,
it was a real luxury
to have your picture taken.

24:46.018 --> 24:51.824
I've had more pictures taken
in the last five years
than my entire life.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.092
Say cheese.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.795
You'll send that to us?

24:55.995 --> 24:56.963
Of course.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.700
Oh, is dear
Mr. Dittmann around?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.168
No, at a conference,

25:03.402 --> 25:05.638
But I'm sure
he'll be happy
to see you tomorrow.

25:05.838 --> 25:06.639
Wonderful.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.247
I'll radio you when
the dim sum's here.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.683
Okay.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.552
Is this thing safe
so soon after a quake?

25:19.752 --> 25:22.254
Sure thing. It's
been retrofitted
up to an 8.0.

25:22.454 --> 25:25.558
All right, well,
too out of shape
to take the stairs then.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.594
All right. 14th floor.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.896
I hope this thing
can make it.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.163
Oh, it's perfectly safe.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.910
Okay. Uh, Hank, Ali,

25:44.110 --> 25:45.845
I've tried
calling and texting,

25:46.045 --> 25:47.914
And this is
the only other way

25:48.114 --> 25:50.182
I could think to get
a message to you both.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.051
2,000 hideous,
fake, metal palm trees

25:53.552 --> 25:55.321
Disguised as cell towers
all over the entire
Los Angeles area,

25:55.521 --> 25:58.024
And I can't even make
a single phone call.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.926
All right.
Well, here's the plan.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.260
I'm coming downtown.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.029
Ali, I know about Nick,

26:03.229 --> 26:05.765
And he's with me
coming to get you.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.001
We just got a glimpse
from up high

26:09.201 --> 26:10.970
Of the entire
San Gabriel basin,

26:11.170 --> 26:13.973
And there are
fires and smoke

26:14.173 --> 26:15.174
And helicopters.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.809
Angry people panicked.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.046
Ali, if you're getting this,
please just stay put.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.314
Stay in the hotel.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.315
It looks like the duration

26:23.515 --> 26:24.851
Between foreshocks
is decreasing,

26:25.818 --> 26:26.853
Which means
that The Big, Big One

26:28.254 --> 26:29.956
Might actually hit sooner than
my prediction model suggested.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.891
I can't be sure
until I get

26:32.091 --> 26:34.093
Some sort of GPS or cellular
to cross-reference

26:34.293 --> 26:35.695
The seismic
or the geological data

26:36.863 --> 26:37.964
From all the sources
on and off the continent,

26:39.131 --> 26:40.332
But forget about all that.
Just stay put, Ali.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.268
If you're getting this,
stay put.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.070
We're coming to get you.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.605
It is getting
very crazy out here.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.253
[Beeps]

27:01.453 --> 27:04.156
According to this,
we're about to have
another minor trembler.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.357
What's minor?

27:05.557 --> 27:06.926
M3 or 4.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.228
We might not even feel it,
though, in a moving...

27:25.377 --> 27:28.114
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

27:34.253 --> 27:37.656
[Tires squeal]

27:41.493 --> 27:43.763
[Screaming]

27:55.174 --> 27:58.144
[Panting]

28:01.948 --> 28:03.049
You okay?

28:03.249 --> 28:04.683
Yeah.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.390
[Engine grinds]

28:11.590 --> 28:13.225
[Warning chimes]
Aw, man.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.837
I told you so.
I knew it.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.739
I'm sorry.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.340
All right,
get me out of here.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.076
Don't worry, hon.
Don't worry.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.344
This contraption
has lasted 100 years.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.815
That means
it's... it's strong,
not weak.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.016
Ohh! Ahh!

28:37.216 --> 28:37.950
Are you okay,
Mr. Lowenstein?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.186
My heart.
Oh, what's wrong?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.788
Sweetheart,
Where's your medication?

28:41.988 --> 28:44.390
Nightstand.
Where do you think?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.492
Oh, he left his medicine
on the nightstand.

28:46.692 --> 28:48.861
Why would you
leave it there?

28:49.061 --> 28:49.896
[Groans]
Hello?

28:50.096 --> 28:50.897
Hello?
Anyone there?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.098
Jackson?

28:53.165 --> 28:54.400
God, please get
this door open, please!

29:10.282 --> 29:11.350
Malibu Aviation,

29:11.550 --> 29:13.953
This is Bell Four Delta Chaz
requesting landing.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.922
We've been rerouted
due to the earthquake.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.456
Roger that, Bell Four.
Affirmative.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.458
Be advised
it's chaotic down here.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.459
Proceed with caution.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.161
[Beeps]

29:26.365 --> 29:27.499
Minor tremors?

29:27.699 --> 29:28.534
Well, the data's

29:29.435 --> 29:30.136
Hitting me
in fragments, okay?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.004
The entire
infrastructure
must be hosed.

29:32.839 --> 29:33.339
I'm missing
some packets.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.441
Maybe if we're lucky,
we'll get some...

29:36.475 --> 29:37.977
A data signal or
a Wi-Fi or something.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.246
Oh, good.
I could use a latte.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.981
What are we gonna do?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.315
[Sighs]

29:43.515 --> 29:44.783
Look at
the bright side.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.520
[Birds squawking]

29:48.720 --> 29:50.990
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.992
How are
we gonna get downtown?

29:53.192 --> 29:56.395
Damn it! Not my baby!

29:56.595 --> 29:57.864
Can you fix it?

29:58.064 --> 29:59.265
She's not going anywhere.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.968
What are we
gonna do now?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.004
I got us covered.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.111
Bye, old girl.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.345
Really?

30:18.117 --> 30:19.318
What are you doing?

30:19.518 --> 30:20.920
This van was my baby.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.021
You don't remember
your first car?

30:22.221 --> 30:23.990
No.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.391
You don't remember
your first car?

30:25.591 --> 30:27.026
No. Come on.
Let's go.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.427
Ali said that about you.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.329
What?
Nothing.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.865
Let me
just grab something.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.134
Well, please hurry.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.176
Oh, my God,
Kerouac. Really?

30:44.376 --> 30:46.112
No.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.185
What was that?

30:53.385 --> 30:54.453
Nothing. Let's go.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.965
I gave her this.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.204
Which one,
you think?

31:12.404 --> 31:14.206
We're going
to steal a car?

31:14.406 --> 31:16.442
Well, if you're right,
there's not gonna be
a car left anyways.

31:16.642 --> 31:17.576
What if
the owners need it?

31:17.776 --> 31:19.278
More than we need it?

31:19.478 --> 31:20.947
No, no, no, no! Don't!

31:21.147 --> 31:22.348
This one's unlocked.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.017
Last thing we need
is a lacerated wrist.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.385
Think before
you act, please.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.553
Yeah, yeah.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.429
[Sparks crackle]

31:37.629 --> 31:39.231
You know, if you're trying
to convince me you're

31:40.599 --> 31:41.333
A good influence
on my stepdaughter,
it's not working.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.003
Look, I'm not
trying to convince you
of anything, all right?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.238
[Engine starts]

31:50.776 --> 31:51.910
All right.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.687
[Car horns honking]

32:04.090 --> 32:05.457
[Echoing]
Help me!

32:05.657 --> 32:07.093
Anyone!

32:07.293 --> 32:09.161
We're in the elevator!

32:09.361 --> 32:10.963
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
look at me.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.966
Look at me.
You're going to be
all right.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.467
Cough. Cough.
It helps. Cough.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.503
Take deep breaths,
Arnold.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.338
Arnie,
please don't leave me!

32:19.538 --> 32:21.440
Please stay with me.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.542
Sir, sir, hand me
my purse, please.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.211
I think there's
some aspirin in it.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.046
I think it could help.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.948
* Let me call you
sweetheart *

32:30.149 --> 32:34.253
* I'm in love with you *

32:41.660 --> 32:43.595
Damn it. The network
is completely down.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.966
I have no idea how
that activity affected
the prediction model.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.368
Take Canyon Road.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.138
Canyon Road?
That'll take forever.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.673
You think the freeways
are gonna be any faster?

32:54.873 --> 32:56.008
[Sighs]

32:59.378 --> 33:01.547
I just want you to know

33:01.747 --> 33:03.282
I'm not seeing
any other girls.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.018
I thought you weren't
trying to convince me.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.686
I'm committed to Ali.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.488
Well, if you were
so committed to her,

33:09.688 --> 33:11.557
Why did you convince her
to drop out of school?

33:11.757 --> 33:13.292
What makes you think
that was my idea?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.661
And that tattoo? I bet
that was your idea as well.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.663
God, you really
don't know Ali, do you?

33:17.863 --> 33:21.733
Look, she
dropped out of college
on her own, okay?

33:21.933 --> 33:23.602
It was holding her back.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.072
She wants to be
an event planner,
not a biology major.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.040
Obviously
I'm all for college.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.509
It's why I'm there.
I need it.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.512
But she doesn't.
She can blaze
her own trail.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.582
Thank you,
Jack Kerouac.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.585
[Crumbling]

33:41.653 --> 33:43.155
Stop the car!
What's wrong?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.556
The bridge is closed.

33:44.756 --> 33:45.624
What if they closed it

33:46.458 --> 33:46.525
Because of
the earthquake?

33:47.259 --> 33:47.826
Oh, look at the cracks.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.029
Should I turn around?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.631
We don't have time.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.401
We're just
gonna have to drive
across it carefully.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.336
You wanna go over it?
Carefully.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.737
Like that's gonna
make us any lighter.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.806
Just drive down
the middle slowly.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.322
Ohh!

34:18.724 --> 34:20.192
Okay.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.460
We're okay.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.067
Oh, no.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.203
Stop! Slow down!

34:38.210 --> 34:39.645
[Gasps]
Okay.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.246
Go! Get out of the way!

34:41.447 --> 34:42.481

[Engine grinds]

34:50.456 --> 34:51.290
Come on. Go. Go.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.725
I've got
a weak data signal.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.261
Oh, of course.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.496
96% chance
of an M5 foreshock.

34:57.696 --> 34:58.564
What? When?

34:58.764 --> 34:59.598
Any minute!

Come on.
Come on. Come on!

35:05.837 --> 35:07.406
We're okay.
We're off the bridge.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.407
Off the bridge.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.411
Come on!

35:12.611 --> 35:14.280
[Engine grinding]

35:15.814 --> 35:16.615

MOLLY: Leave the truck!
Come on!

35:19.017 --> 35:21.687
I can't!
My son, he's hurt!

35:21.887 --> 35:23.622
It's gonna collapse!
Please help me!

35:23.822 --> 35:25.657
We have to get him
to a hospital!

35:27.025 --> 35:28.227

35:28.427 --> 35:29.661
Please...
Here. Help me.

We've gotta go.
We've gotta go.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.411
He'll be all right.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.145
We just have to get him
to a hospital!

35:48.146 --> 35:48.747
I can't lift him.
Get to a hospital.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.751
Okay, welcome back, folks.
I'm Ron Jantz,

36:25.951 --> 36:28.387
And we're bringing you
everything we know so far

36:28.587 --> 36:29.921
About the series
of earthquakes

36:31.323 --> 36:32.224
That have struck the greater
Los Angeles area this afternoon,

36:33.725 --> 36:35.894
Starting with
the 4.0-magnitude quake
off the coast of Malibu.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.429
Now here's what we know so far.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.898
Authorities are attempting
to dig out residents

36:41.099 --> 36:42.501
In four residential blocks
near the intersection

36:43.735 --> 36:45.537
Of Temescal Canyon Road
and Pacific Coast Highway.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.906
Approximately 24 to 25 homes

36:48.106 --> 36:49.641
Have been destroyed
by landslides

36:49.841 --> 36:52.778
In what can only be called
a massive avalanche.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.513
[Rumbling]
[crew yelling]

36:54.713 --> 36:57.249
That's an earthquake.
I'm under the table, folks.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.784
Please,
everybody head for cover.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.587
Everyone be safe.
This is serious. Please.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.322
Oh, this is not good.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.386
[Sirens blaring]

37:42.761 --> 37:44.663
This can't be.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.804
Excuse me, sir?
Dr. Michaels?

37:54.039 --> 37:55.841
You are not
gonna believe this.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.680
I been asking
for aftershock activity
since 1 A.M.,

38:01.880 --> 38:02.948
Not worst-case
scenario models.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.383
Excuse me, sir.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.751
Wait a minute. Wait.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.753
Yes.
What are these nodes?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.388
That's the activity
today.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.056
That there,
that's the 5.0

38:11.256 --> 38:12.458
From 30 minutes ago,
right?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.427
This is Molly Dunn's
prediction data.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.729
It's a confirmation of
the slip-strike events.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.499
It's a near
perfect match with
the recorded live data.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.802
The readings,
they're going
well into tonight,

38:24.002 --> 38:26.037
And they're topping
over an M10.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.773
And you've cross-checked
all this?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.841
Three times.
So did Jenkins.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.577
Sir, those are
not aftershocks.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.078
They're foreshocks.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.647
Henry, get me
the Governor's office!

38:41.453 --> 38:44.322
Okay, for those of you
now just joining us,

38:44.523 --> 38:46.558
A general evacuation order
has been issued

38:46.758 --> 38:48.059
For the entire city
of Los Angeles.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.928
Now this includes all
of the outlying areas.

38:50.128 --> 38:53.331
I repeat,
a general evacuation order

38:53.532 --> 38:55.867
Has been issued for
the entire city of Los Angeles

38:56.067 --> 38:57.669
And all of its outlying areas.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.538
The evacuation is mandatory.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.872
The magnitude
of the next quake

39:01.973 --> 39:03.074
Is expected to exceed
the tolerance levels

39:04.309 --> 39:06.344
Of most, if not all,
of the area's infrastructure.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.979
Now we do have
confirmed estimates

39:08.179 --> 39:10.015
Out of the United States
Geological Survey

39:10.215 --> 39:12.618
Putting the expected quake
at a 10.0.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.720
An evacuation order
has been issued

39:14.920 --> 39:16.121
For all
of Southern California.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.556
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

39:27.132 --> 39:27.899
TOWER: Citation 223...
Damn it.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.035
Hold your position!
Any luck?

39:30.235 --> 39:31.837
Traffic on the runway!
No.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.939
Look, since we're
still paying for this,

39:34.139 --> 39:35.574
We need you
to take us to Pasadena.

39:35.774 --> 39:36.742
What? No.

39:37.776 --> 39:38.410
Pasadena is
not gonna be
any safer.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.712
No. To get our baby.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.749
Hey, look, I got
my own wife and
kid to worry about.

39:43.949 --> 39:44.816
They're relying
on me.

39:45.751 --> 39:46.384
But you said
they were downtown.

39:47.052 --> 39:47.586
This is on the way.

39:48.520 --> 39:48.587
Actually, it's not.
From Malibu,

39:49.521 --> 39:50.388
First is downtown,
then Pasadena.

39:51.557 --> 39:51.957
Well, we have
a signed agreement
with you.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.029
As soon as we
fuel up the chopper,
we'll take...

39:58.229 --> 39:59.665
This is our charter.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.700
Look, lady, you heard
of force majeure?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.735
This is about
as force majeured
as you can get.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.137
Hold on!

40:06.337 --> 40:08.406
Look, honey,
we'll be okay.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.912
No!
No!

40:25.791 --> 40:27.759
Hey, hey, hey, fella,
I'm glad to see you.

40:27.959 --> 40:28.894
We need
to rent a chopper.

40:29.795 --> 40:30.629
Sorry, man.
Everything's gone.

40:31.963 --> 40:32.664
As soon as I swap
out this starter,
I'm outta here.

40:33.965 --> 40:34.833
I wish I could
help you, but it's
only a two-seater.

40:36.034 --> 40:36.702
Come on. There's gotta be
something we can rent.

40:37.603 --> 40:38.169
Anything!
What about that one?

40:39.037 --> 40:40.739
Please, sir,
that old relic?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.608
You won't get it
two feet off the ground

40:42.808 --> 40:43.709
Without
a new rotor pin.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.076
Can't you please
fix it for us?

40:46.211 --> 40:47.713
Look, I gotta
get outta here,
all right?

40:47.913 --> 40:49.080
They're saying
this whole valley

40:50.315 --> 40:51.082
Will be underwater
by the time
this quake hits.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.183
Look,

40:52.383 --> 40:53.585
I'm begging you.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.087
My wife and daughter
are depending on me.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.490
Sorry, man.
It's every man
for himself.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.091
5,000.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.060
What?

41:02.260 --> 41:04.763
I will pay you
5,000 bucks to fix it.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.501
I don't know. I'd have
to weld a makeshift piece.

41:09.701 --> 41:10.502
I-I'm not sure.

41:10.702 --> 41:11.803
10,000.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.204
Uh...

41:15.607 --> 41:18.009
I will do my best.
No promises.

41:21.279 --> 41:24.650
On one condition.
We get my baby first.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.220
Okay, listen. Um...

41:30.722 --> 41:32.624
We have tried a couple
of different routes,

41:32.824 --> 41:34.492
And they are no good.

41:34.693 --> 41:38.096
Hank, if you can see a route
and get a text out to us,

41:38.296 --> 41:41.700
Anything,
we sure would appreciate it.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.036
Um, we're gonna keep trying.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.138
I'll see you soon.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.540
[Sirens blare]

41:49.741 --> 41:50.776
Ali?

41:50.976 --> 41:51.843
Jackson?
Yeah.

41:52.778 --> 41:53.812
Hello? Hello?
Get me outta here!

41:54.613 --> 41:55.246
Thank God!
Open the door!

41:56.114 --> 41:56.715
What do you think
I'm doing?

41:57.583 --> 41:57.949
Help me pry
this door open.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.585
Okay.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.732
Oh. Oh, thank God!

42:13.932 --> 42:15.033
JANTZ: Those of you
now just joining us...

42:15.233 --> 42:17.235
I have to get
to the room
and get medication.

42:17.435 --> 42:18.870
He's having
a heart attack.
Help them.

42:19.070 --> 42:21.873
Room 1333,
nitroglycerin!

42:22.073 --> 42:23.775
On the bed stand!
Hurry!

42:23.975 --> 42:25.777
Um, sir, could you
give me a hand?

42:25.977 --> 42:27.312
I... Sir?

42:27.512 --> 42:31.016
Mr. Kaplin.
Mr. Kaplin.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.751
We do have
confirmed estimates

42:32.951 --> 42:35.020
Out of the United States
Geological Survey

42:35.220 --> 42:39.224
Putting the expected quake
at a 10.0 in approximately
90 minutes.

42:39.424 --> 42:40.926
An evacuation order...

43:18.096 --> 43:19.865
I didn't
know which one.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.038
I have to help
Gary with something
on the third floor,

43:27.238 --> 43:28.173
Some kind of injury.

43:29.107 --> 43:29.708
Okay. Go. Go.
I'll be on walkie.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.810
Breathe. Breathe.
Just relax.

43:32.010 --> 43:32.878
San Andreas fault line.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.180
I repeat,
a general evacuation order

43:35.380 --> 43:38.650
Has been issued
for the entire city
of Los Angeles

43:38.850 --> 43:40.686
And all
of its outlying areas.

43:40.886 --> 43:42.821
Evacuation
is strongly urged,

43:43.021 --> 43:44.790
As the magnitude
of this quake
is expected...

43:44.990 --> 43:46.124
Evacuation?

43:46.324 --> 43:47.859
We've got
to get out of here.

43:48.059 --> 43:50.729
You said this place
can handle an 8.0?

43:50.929 --> 43:51.997
We gotta go, like, now!

43:52.197 --> 43:54.299
Wait! Please,
we need your help.

43:54.499 --> 43:56.668
I can't carry him.

43:56.868 --> 43:57.803
NICK: Ali?

43:58.870 --> 44:00.005
Yeah. Go ahead.

44:00.205 --> 44:01.873
I just got word
the National Guard

44:02.073 --> 44:04.409
Wants us all
on an evacuation bus
in 30 minutes.

44:04.609 --> 44:06.277
They can only fit,
like, 100 people.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.278
Okay. We're coming.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.114
100? We gotta hurry!

44:09.314 --> 44:11.750
We'll make it.
I promise you
we'll make it.

44:11.950 --> 44:14.219
I... I just can't
take that chance.

44:14.419 --> 44:15.220
Please!

44:18.289 --> 44:19.725
Fine.

44:19.925 --> 44:21.693
But if we don't
make it on that bus,

44:21.893 --> 44:23.361
There's gonna
be hell to pay.

44:24.796 --> 44:25.731
Come on.

44:28.366 --> 44:30.135
Who can predict
earthquakes, anyway?

44:30.335 --> 44:32.170
My stepmom, actually.

44:43.481 --> 44:45.250
[Sirens blaring]

45:11.843 --> 45:13.378
Good call on Zoo Drive.

45:13.578 --> 45:15.080
The freeway looks packed.

45:17.482 --> 45:20.118
Well, you were right
about Canyon Road.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.754
You know,
collapsing bridge aside.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.724
Oh, where are we?

45:26.925 --> 45:28.259
It's a shortcut
through Griffith Park,

45:28.459 --> 45:29.260
Behind the zoo.

45:31.196 --> 45:33.464
I hate to admit it,
but I'm really glad
you came along.

45:35.934 --> 45:36.868
Wow.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.404
Ali never listens to me.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.940
Oh, if you think
she listens to
everything I say,

45:42.140 --> 45:43.174
You got
another think coming.

45:44.275 --> 45:45.343
She just
crosses her arms
and says fine

45:46.477 --> 45:48.146
And then does whatever
she was doing anyways.

45:48.346 --> 45:49.881
Yeah, I get that,

45:50.081 --> 45:51.416
Followed by
a slammed door.

45:51.616 --> 45:52.851
Ah, I had that.
You know,

45:53.952 --> 45:54.019
I signed her up for
self-defense classes.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.187
I told her
New York could be
a dangerous place.

45:56.788 --> 45:57.755
Huh? Wait. What?

45:59.490 --> 46:01.893
She said
she was gonna tell you.

46:03.528 --> 46:05.496
You're moving to New York?

46:06.631 --> 46:07.933
Not right away.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.168
After I graduate.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.236
Why?

46:12.503 --> 46:14.840
Because we want
to live there?

46:16.241 --> 46:18.076
And you're taking
my stepdaughter with you?

46:18.276 --> 46:20.111
I'm not
taking her, okay?

46:20.311 --> 46:21.847
We want
to live together.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.215
No way.

46:27.652 --> 46:30.521
Absolutely not.
Okay, for starters,

46:30.721 --> 46:32.991
She's gonna go back to school
and get a degree,

46:33.191 --> 46:34.525
Event planner
or not, okay?

46:34.725 --> 46:36.127
Because this is
completely ridiculous!

46:36.327 --> 46:37.562
Look, nothing's
set in stone.

46:37.762 --> 46:39.797
[Both gasp]

46:39.998 --> 46:41.432
What the heck
was that?

46:41.632 --> 46:42.868
I don't know.
I barely saw it.

46:43.869 --> 46:43.935
Please don't tell me
that was human.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.304
Maybe it was a dog.

46:46.504 --> 46:48.239
That's just as bad!

46:53.278 --> 46:55.013
Oh, my God.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.247
Oh, my God.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.917
I-It's a baby hippo.

46:59.117 --> 47:00.852
[Groans]

47:01.052 --> 47:02.453
It's alive.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.122
[Sighs]

47:06.457 --> 47:08.359
[Roaring]

47:10.261 --> 47:11.930
Oh, God.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.164
No, no, no, no, no, no!

47:13.364 --> 47:15.466
Hey! Hey!
[car horn honking]

47:15.666 --> 47:17.035
Hey!

47:17.235 --> 47:18.303
Hey!

47:22.640 --> 47:23.574
[Grunting]

47:29.981 --> 47:30.982
[Screams]

47:33.251 --> 47:35.120
Hey! Hey!

47:36.221 --> 47:37.322
Wait!

47:39.624 --> 47:41.159
Wait! Stop!

47:42.293 --> 47:43.494
Come on!

47:48.099 --> 47:49.034
[Grunts]

47:56.474 --> 47:58.109
Come on! Let's go!

47:59.644 --> 48:01.146
Drive! Drive! Drive!

48:07.285 --> 48:08.219
Whew!

48:08.419 --> 48:10.421
Yeah,
definitely not dead.

48:10.621 --> 48:11.556
Yeah, I figured.

48:12.557 --> 48:13.291
Must have escaped
from the zoo, huh?

48:13.491 --> 48:14.292
Yeah.

48:14.492 --> 48:15.460
Yeah.

48:17.362 --> 48:18.663
[Grunts]

48:20.798 --> 48:23.434
All the animals
can feel it coming.

48:23.634 --> 48:26.137
This is gonna be
bigger than anything
we've ever seen.

48:27.705 --> 48:29.374
We might not
make it out, you know.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.280
Yeah.

48:52.230 --> 48:55.300
I'm Edna,
Edna Lowenstein.

48:55.500 --> 48:58.669
Uh, Kaplin,
Miles Kaplin.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.305
Oh, well, Miles,

49:00.505 --> 49:02.073
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

49:02.273 --> 49:05.010
Consider this
your good deed
for the day.

49:05.210 --> 49:10.681
Ah, well, no good deed
goes unpunished,
as they say.

49:10.881 --> 49:13.151
I-It's my anniversary.

49:13.351 --> 49:16.687
If this is
how much the Earth
moves on our 40th,

49:16.887 --> 49:20.158
Think of what
it'll do on our 50th.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.193
Sir, could you help us?

49:22.393 --> 49:23.494
Hey!
We have a sick man!

49:23.694 --> 49:25.063
Hey! Hey!

49:26.264 --> 49:28.099
Um, okay,

49:28.299 --> 49:30.368
Maybe we should
pick up the pace
a little bit, huh?

49:30.568 --> 49:32.503
[Sirens blaring outside]
Sweetheart.

49:32.703 --> 49:34.239
All right, come on!
Come on.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.076
Arnie? Oh, darling.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.058
Good afternoon, everyone.

49:53.258 --> 49:56.027
I'm Ron Jantz,
and this is 10 Action News

49:56.227 --> 49:57.462
With the latest on...

49:58.696 --> 50:00.231
Really the only way
to describe this situation now

50:00.431 --> 50:01.999
Is as a swarm of earthquakes,

50:03.434 --> 50:05.103
A swarm of ever more violent,
ever more stronger earthquakes.

50:05.303 --> 50:06.771
I just don't know
how else to put it.

50:06.971 --> 50:08.206
We're doing our best

50:09.307 --> 50:10.508
To keep our broadcast
on the air for you.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.444
Now, we just had to switch over
to our diesel generators.

50:13.644 --> 50:15.180
For those of you
just joining us,

50:15.380 --> 50:17.148
An evacuation order
has been issued for all...

50:17.348 --> 50:19.217
I think we're
the only idiots
driving into town.

50:19.417 --> 50:21.386
Shh!
Routes going into
the downtown area

50:21.586 --> 50:23.388
Have been blocked
by the National Guard,

50:23.588 --> 50:26.724
And both sides of the 10 Freeway
are now flowing east.

50:26.924 --> 50:30.695
Everyone is urged to get out
and get out now.

50:30.895 --> 50:32.497
Oh, please
let her be all right.

50:32.697 --> 50:34.031
She will be.

50:34.232 --> 50:35.366
The MTA has announced

50:35.566 --> 50:37.735
The suspension
of all subway services,

50:37.935 --> 50:41.772
But buses are taking people east
of the San Andreas fault line.

50:41.972 --> 50:44.142
I repeat,
a general evacuation order

50:44.342 --> 50:46.177
Has been issued
for the entire city
of Los Angeles...

50:46.377 --> 50:49.114
I didn't even know
she wanted to be
an event planner.

50:49.314 --> 50:52.183
I feel like I've
spent the last six years
trying to get to know her,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.085
And some kid
with a rap sheet
comes along,

50:54.285 --> 50:55.286
And she
just spills her guts.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.490
It's part of being
a parent, I guess.

51:00.758 --> 51:02.160
Your mother know you?

51:03.228 --> 51:04.562
My mom probably assumes

51:04.762 --> 51:05.563
I'm in jail...

51:06.964 --> 51:10.568
And my dad is M.I.A.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.638
My mom kind of
just checked out,

51:13.838 --> 51:16.407
So I hooked up
with a tough crowd.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.411
I didn't know that.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.081
That's why I've sunk
everything into college.

51:24.282 --> 51:26.083
Just hoping I can
turn everything around.

51:27.952 --> 51:29.454
You know I can't
change your grade

51:29.654 --> 51:30.521
Because of
a sob story, though.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.557
Hey, I'm not asking
for that, okay?

51:32.757 --> 51:34.392
I'm just asking
that you treat me

51:34.592 --> 51:36.127
Like I'm someone
that belongs there,

51:37.462 --> 51:38.529
Not like I'm some loser
that just walked
into class.

51:40.298 --> 51:42.633
You really think
I'd care so much
about a grade

51:42.833 --> 51:43.868
If I wasn't
being serious?

51:46.537 --> 51:49.640
Okay. If the college
is still standing

51:49.840 --> 51:52.310
After all of this,
you've got a deal.

51:53.411 --> 51:54.612
And same thing
with Ali, okay?

51:54.812 --> 51:56.447
I won't lie.
I've put up the numbers.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.283
Don't need to hear that.

51:58.483 --> 51:59.284
No, look.

52:00.551 --> 52:03.521
She's exactly
what I need, okay?

52:03.721 --> 52:05.390
I want to be the guy
she deserves.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.592
That's what drives me.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.128
That's sweet,

52:11.329 --> 52:12.630
But just so you know...

52:13.931 --> 52:15.533
She's my daughter,

52:15.733 --> 52:17.735
And I don't care much
what she does for you.

52:17.935 --> 52:19.204
I care
what you do for her.

52:20.538 --> 52:21.539
WOMAN: Please stop!

52:21.739 --> 52:23.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop!

52:23.708 --> 52:24.775
Please stop!

52:25.843 --> 52:26.644
Oh, Nick, I don't
think we should stop.

52:28.078 --> 52:29.580
Nick, please,
we don't have much time
left to get to Ali.

52:29.780 --> 52:30.715
Everything okay?

52:32.783 --> 52:34.719
I am so sorry
to stop you like that,

52:34.919 --> 52:37.788
But no one will stop.
I tried calling AAA,

52:37.988 --> 52:40.858
And all you get
is this recording saying
that nobody's available.

52:41.058 --> 52:42.293
Okay, so you got
some car troubles?

52:42.493 --> 52:43.861
Yeah.
All right.

52:44.061 --> 52:45.730
We had a giraffe
trample over our car.

52:46.797 --> 52:47.765
We gotta go,
all right?

52:47.965 --> 52:48.866
Let's get
you outta here.

52:49.834 --> 52:49.900
Why are you guys
heading that way?

52:50.535 --> 52:51.336
You gotta get out.

52:52.169 --> 52:52.603
My girlfriend's
downtown.

52:53.671 --> 52:54.472
Oh, honey, you're never
gonna make that.

52:55.139 --> 52:55.873
Well, we gotta try.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.175
No, no, no, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

52:59.109 --> 52:59.510
Why are you
heading up that way?

53:00.411 --> 53:00.745
How many miles
you got on this?

53:01.312 --> 53:02.179
About 100,000.

53:03.214 --> 53:04.181
Can you start the car
for me, please?

53:05.316 --> 53:07.785
[Engine grinding]

53:07.985 --> 53:09.320
Okay, you can
turn it off.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.322
[Sighs] Yeah,
I can't fix this.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.491
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.693
No, it's cool.
We got room in our car.
You can come with us.

53:15.893 --> 53:18.563
We don't have time
to go downtown.

53:18.763 --> 53:20.298
Please, there's roadblocks.
It's suicide.

53:20.498 --> 53:21.732
Well, we gotta try,
okay?

53:21.932 --> 53:23.468
We got the room.
You can come along.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.308
No, Mom! No.

53:30.508 --> 53:31.809
Mom!
Whoa!

53:32.009 --> 53:33.344
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.

53:33.544 --> 53:34.412
We have
to get out now!

53:34.612 --> 53:35.380
God damn it.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.848
My daughter
is all I've got...

53:38.983 --> 53:39.917
And we
don't have time

53:40.117 --> 53:41.452
To go downtown.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.522
I have to get
my baby out,
so let's go.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.791
I gotta save
my baby, too, okay?
I can't leave her!

53:46.991 --> 53:49.226
We got a helicopter on top
of a building down there!

53:49.427 --> 53:50.895
We have to get out now!

53:52.330 --> 53:54.332
Have you not been
listening to what they
have been saying?

53:54.532 --> 53:55.733
I can't leave her.

53:57.101 --> 53:58.769
Is that
your final word?

54:01.038 --> 54:02.573
[Laughs]

54:02.773 --> 54:04.675
Okay, you,
whoever you are,

54:04.875 --> 54:06.377
I'm gonna shoot
this nice young man

54:06.577 --> 54:08.279
If you don't give me
those car keys.

54:08.479 --> 54:09.614
No, Mom, don't!
Sarah!

54:09.814 --> 54:11.316
There are no keys.
What?

54:11.516 --> 54:12.717
I hot-wired the car!
Mama, please.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.352
What?
Ma'am, we are willing

54:14.552 --> 54:15.720
To take you wherever
you wanna go...

54:15.920 --> 54:16.954
No, Mrs. Dunn, it's okay.
No, it's okay,

54:17.154 --> 54:18.756
All right?
Just... Just go get Ali!

54:18.956 --> 54:20.257
That's what's important
right now!

54:20.458 --> 54:21.292
You better not!

54:22.192 --> 54:22.893
Just tell her
I love her! Go!

54:23.961 --> 54:26.431
Mom?
I will shoot him.

54:26.631 --> 54:27.765
No.

54:28.999 --> 54:31.536
I mean it.
I'm going to shoot him!

54:31.736 --> 54:34.004
Mom!
I mean it, Sarah!

54:34.204 --> 54:36.607
I'll shoot.
She's my baby!
I'll shoot!

54:36.807 --> 54:38.509
No! Ahh!

54:38.709 --> 54:40.277
No! No!
You...

54:40.478 --> 54:41.679
Don't!
Just take it!

54:41.879 --> 54:42.947
Just take it!
Just take it!

54:43.147 --> 54:44.349
Get the hell
out of here!

54:58.763 --> 55:00.297
I told you go to.

55:00.498 --> 55:02.633
And I told you we
shouldn't have stopped.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.572
JANTZ: The National Guard
has closed down

55:07.772 --> 55:09.840
All access
into downtown Los Angeles.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.977
All traffic on the 10 Freeway
is now eastbound.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.845
There is no westbound traffic.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.047
You cannot get
to downtown Los Angeles.

55:17.247 --> 55:19.684
The governor has declared
a state of martial law,

55:19.884 --> 55:20.985
And anyone caught trying

55:22.119 --> 55:23.320
To get into downtown L.A.
will be arrested.

55:25.089 --> 55:26.691
Shit,
they're getting closer.

55:26.891 --> 55:27.958
What do you mean?

55:29.159 --> 55:30.561
What are you doing?

55:30.761 --> 55:31.829
Seeing how much time
we have left.

55:32.029 --> 55:32.963
You got a signal?

55:33.163 --> 55:35.332
A faint data signal.

55:35.533 --> 55:36.601
But, shit, my battery.

55:36.801 --> 55:38.403
Oh. I have a backup.

55:41.071 --> 55:42.873
Thanks.

55:43.073 --> 55:43.874
Oh, no.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.009
No. Damn it!

55:45.209 --> 55:46.711
No, no. Shit.
What is it?

55:46.911 --> 55:47.912
No.
What is it?

55:48.979 --> 55:51.416
This thing that
I wanted to give to Ali.

55:51.616 --> 55:52.617
She loved it.

55:52.817 --> 55:53.784
What was it?

55:53.984 --> 55:54.819
Ferdinand.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.454
Who?
Ferdinand.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.589
This stupid duck.

55:58.789 --> 55:59.624
Damn it!

55:59.824 --> 56:00.891
You okay?

56:01.091 --> 56:01.959
Yeah. It's stupid.

56:03.093 --> 56:05.062
[Beeping]

56:05.262 --> 56:06.564
Oh, this can't
be right.

56:06.764 --> 56:07.732
What?

56:07.932 --> 56:08.799
Updated estimate.

56:10.635 --> 56:12.803
It's gonna be bigger
than we thought.

56:13.003 --> 56:14.505
It's saying a 12.0.

56:15.906 --> 56:17.942
Nothing's gonna be
left standing.

56:18.142 --> 56:19.444
So we better get going.

56:20.545 --> 56:21.779
Yeah.

56:32.690 --> 56:34.759
The quake that hit L.A.
earlier today

56:34.959 --> 56:36.093
Measured at 5.3

56:37.294 --> 56:39.163
According to the United States
Geological Survey.

56:39.363 --> 56:41.899
That quake was followed
by several strong tremors.

56:42.099 --> 56:44.001
One of them, we believe,
was another quake.

56:44.201 --> 56:46.537
There was some damage
to some buildings and homes,

56:46.737 --> 56:47.972
But nothing like the one

56:48.172 --> 56:50.641
That's about to hit
in roughly 60 minutes.

57:04.154 --> 57:05.656
[Gasping]

57:30.781 --> 57:32.483
109. 110.

57:32.683 --> 57:33.484
MILES: Wait!
111.

57:34.351 --> 57:34.418
[Radio]
No more! No more!

57:35.285 --> 57:35.352
We're stuffed
like sardines!

57:36.120 --> 57:36.186
Bus is full!
Copy that.

57:36.921 --> 57:37.988
Sir, the bus
is full.

57:38.422 --> 57:38.889
What?

57:39.089 --> 57:40.725
Wait. Is there...

57:40.925 --> 57:42.527
Is there
another bus coming?

57:42.727 --> 57:43.928
I doubt it.
Next best option

57:44.128 --> 57:45.530
Is a bomb shelter
on Flower.

57:52.803 --> 57:56.106
A general evacuation has been
given to Los Angeles and all

57:56.306 --> 57:58.909
Of the surrounding outlying
areas. Pretty much anyone

57:59.109 --> 58:02.046
West of the San Andreas
fault line must evacuate.

58:02.246 --> 58:05.983
A major catastrophic earthquake
event has been predicted

58:06.183 --> 58:09.620
To strike downtown
Los Angeles at any minute.

58:13.658 --> 58:14.992
Shit!

58:15.192 --> 58:16.026
They're
detaining people.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.596
Hey, you guys
can't be here!

58:18.796 --> 58:19.597
We're
evacuating!

58:19.797 --> 58:20.765
Ah, we're so close.

58:22.232 --> 58:23.868
What do we do?
What do we do?

58:24.068 --> 58:24.869
Tunnels.

58:28.305 --> 58:29.740
Sewer?
No, Prohibition tunnels.

58:29.940 --> 58:31.776
I used to run
all up and down them.

58:31.976 --> 58:32.943
They're famous.
Okay, where?

58:33.143 --> 58:34.845
Um, okay, follow me.
Okay.

58:36.914 --> 58:38.616
The entrance
is over here!

58:40.985 --> 58:43.788
What if your data is off
and it hits early?

58:43.988 --> 58:45.556
Then we're
crushed alive. And?

58:54.932 --> 58:57.067
The hotel is
about five blocks away.

58:57.267 --> 58:58.936
The tunnel runs
right under it.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.806
Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

59:04.742 --> 59:05.876
Careful for this wire.

59:06.076 --> 59:07.845
Might have
some electricity in it.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.179
This is crazy.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.548
You sure
you know your way
around down here?

59:12.983 --> 59:14.919
Just trust me.
Watch your step.

59:35.172 --> 59:37.574
No going back now anyway.
Let's go.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.111
Whoa.

59:42.312 --> 59:43.347
What?

59:43.547 --> 59:44.348
Oh, no.

59:45.115 --> 59:45.850
Oh, my God. What happened?

59:46.817 --> 59:47.284
Well, he didn't
die in the quake.

59:48.118 --> 59:48.653
There's no sign
of trauma.

59:49.453 --> 59:50.087
Looks like
he just died.

59:50.688 --> 59:51.656
What killed him?

59:52.723 --> 59:54.659
Oh, no.

59:54.859 --> 59:56.861
Same thing
that's corroding
this penny.

59:58.395 --> 01:00:00.798
Hydrogen sulfide.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.834
Earthquake must
have caused a leak.
[coughs]

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.803
This poor guy
must have been
just down here working

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:07.037
When he got overcome.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:08.138
Is it explosive?

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.840
Very.
[coughing]

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.108
That means...

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:13.110
We're in big trouble.
Come on.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.050
[Both coughing]

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:23.620
I'm so dizzy.
Keep going!

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:24.855
Ah, careful!

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:28.125
Damn it.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.300
[Both coughing]

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:43.808
Help me move this.
We've got to clear
an opening.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:51.081
[Both coughing]

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.883
I'm gonna pass out.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:55.820
I can't go on.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.789
We've got to.
Help me.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.357
Ah, I'm getting
so dizzy.

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.394
[Sirens blaring]

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.100
[Coughs]

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:13.938
Hey, Ali, this one's
just for you, kiddo.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:15.740
We're trying
to make it out to you,

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.808
But it's not looking
really good at this point,

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.376
So...

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.080
I need you to stay safe.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.683
Stay in that hotel.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.020
Your father's
coming to get you.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.289
He's gonna get you
out of there.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:38.796
All right, tell them!

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.398
Tell them I helped you!

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:43.233
I didn't have
to help you!

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:47.171
You told me
that we would make it
on that bus!

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.205
Sir, I understand,
but...

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:49.740
Look, it's leaving!

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.241
Look, I have a life!

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.744
Why should I
be punished for
helping them?

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:54.745
That doesn't make
any sense!

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:55.545
Sir...

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:56.881
I'm getting on that bus!

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:57.882
Sir!

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.016
Get your hands
off me!

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.385
Hey!

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.822
[Grunting]

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:07.391
Get your hands off me!

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:08.859
Get off me!

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.128
I deserve to be
on that bus!

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.197
Calm down, sir!
Calm down, sir!

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:14.264
Calm down!
Get off me!

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.100
[Gunshot]
[gasps]

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.439
Calm down, sir!
Calm down!

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:29.479
All right, back off.

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:32.850
You don't get to choose
who lives and who dies.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.519
I was supposed to be
on that bus.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:37.287
I helped them!

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:42.860
Well, if you
get to choose...

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:45.029
Well,
then so can I.

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.398
Mr. Kaplin,
please don't.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:50.534
You used me.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.176
Hank...

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:02.312
I'm just sending this
to you,

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.781
Because I don't want Ali
to hear or see this.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:05.983
I don't want her to lose hope,

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.118
But I don't want you
to lose hope either,

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:10.454
But things are getting
really tight down here.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:13.991
And you know I'm not the kind
that gets sentimental...

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:21.866
But I just want you
to know that I love you...

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:29.373
You big, strong,
wonderful flyboy, you.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:34.378
You are the Orville
to my Wilbur.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:36.380
Don't you dare say,
"Redenbacher,"

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.483
Because that's a stupid joke,
and I'm always saying

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:42.252
That you're too old
to be saying it, anyway.

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:47.324
But you are my husband,

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.895
My partner, my granite rock,

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:56.533
And I thank God
for you every day.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.139
Thank you so much
for saving me.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.541
You have no idea.

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.276
And no matter what happens,

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:09.013
There's nothing
that's going to take that away,

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:12.149
How I feel for you
and what you mean to me.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:18.889
And if we don't get out of this
alive or together...

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:22.592
Just know that I love you.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:28.532
I love you, Hank.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.036

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.387
She'll make it
without us.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:53.924
Wait.

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:55.359

coming.

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:05.302

I want
to tell you, Nick...

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.296
You're really
a solid guy.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.399
I think it's safe
to say that...

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:13.570
You would
have moved Heaven
and Earth for Ali.

about my grade now?

she threw it away

or something.

When she found that I had it,
she made fun of me...

But it grew on her,

01:07:11.295 --> 01:07:13.530

sentimental about it.

01:22:08.524 --> 01:22:14.030
* To drown
in black water tears *

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.032
* Is this real? *

01:22:16.232 --> 01:22:21.670
* Can we feel something
out beyond our reach? *

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.572
* What can it mean *

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:27.110
* When we wander aimless *

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:30.579
* Through the nightlands? *

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:36.385
* With every step *

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:41.524
* We falter
and fall upon our knees *

01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:44.260
* Beneath the sky *

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.964
* We hide
to escape ourselves *

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:52.235
* Endless night *

01:22:52.435 --> 01:22:57.406
* Before us, an empty void *

01:22:57.606 --> 01:23:00.343
* We cast ourselves *

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:02.645
* Inside *

01:23:02.845 --> 01:23:05.714
* To swallow all our fears *

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.750
* Is this real? *

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:13.722
* Can we feel something
out beyond our reach? *

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.724
* What can it mean *

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:19.062
* When we wander aimless *

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:22.598
* Through the nightlands? *

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.768
* Lands *

01:23:31.774 --> 01:23:35.111
* When we wander aimless *

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:39.348
* Through the nightlands *

01:23:40.305 --> 01:23:46.473
