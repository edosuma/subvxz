WEBVTT

00:34.076 --> 00:37.079
Sure. So, see how I've got them?

00:38.289 --> 00:39.707
There.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.209
- How good is that?

00:44.003 --> 00:46.547
Probably we'll see...

00:52.219 --> 00:55.347
-  What?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.936
Did that hurt, Dad?

01:00.936 --> 01:03.689
No, not really, poppet.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.696
It's just like
the night you were born.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.159
Tell me the story again.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.535
Please!

01:17.578 --> 01:21.707
Well, Cyclone Alice
had hit the coast.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.835
There was no way
to get to the hospital.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.755
So I got out of the truck,

01:27.755 --> 01:30.257
and I squatted down,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.635
and I gave birth to you in the laneway.

01:32.635 --> 01:35.304
And Daddy wrapped you up
in his shirt.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.807
But then he realised that
I wasn't breathing,

01:37.807 --> 01:40.851
and he was trying to
force the air into my lungs.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.854
And then suddenly...

01:43.854 --> 01:48.526
you began to cry,
wailing into the night.

01:48.526 --> 01:51.153
You brought me back to life.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.283
Why don't we have any other family?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.579
It's always been just us, bub.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.208
Us against the world.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.210
Yeah, but let's not forget,

02:06.210 --> 02:09.755
soon there's going to be a new addition
to our little family.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.634
A brother or a sister.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.829
♪ And now the marriage vow
is very sacred

02:41.829 --> 02:44.665
♪ The man has put us together now

02:44.665 --> 02:48.043
♪ You ought to make it stick together

02:48.043 --> 02:51.714
♪ Come on, come on, let's stick together

02:53.632 --> 02:59.638
♪ You know we made a vow
not to leave one another never... ♪

03:17.698 --> 03:23.537
♪ You know we made a vow
not to leave one another never... ♪

03:26.624 --> 03:28.000
- Bye, Daddy!

03:42.056 --> 03:46.727
And after seven long years, Selkie
finally found her skin,

03:46.727 --> 03:49.355
buried beneath the man's house.

03:49.355 --> 03:52.691
And even though she loved her children
more than life itself,

03:52.691 --> 03:56.403
she returned to the sea,
her true self,

03:56.403 --> 03:58.697
a selkie once more.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.823
Go and get it!

04:01.075 --> 04:03.118
Get it! You're gonna get it!

04:04.536 --> 04:06.747
- I'm gonna get you!

04:08.958 --> 04:10.459
I've got you.

04:30.062 --> 04:33.148
- Like bursting fire pods.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.235
- Beautiful, aren't they?
- Yeah.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.029
So, what do you want to do tomorrow?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.032
Town?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.245
Alice, we can't go to town.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.622
Please?

04:51.500 --> 04:54.294
We don't even have the car.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.338
We could walk.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.424
Pretty please?

04:58.424 --> 05:00.467
Dad's not back till Friday.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.929
I'd love to show you the library.

05:03.929 --> 05:09.935
I want to try... a lamington.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.854
Alright.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.741
Is there really a baby in here?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.661
Yeah.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.547
Are we still going to run away?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.872
Wake up, sleepyhead.
It's lamington day.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.565
Made you breakfast in bed.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.361
Just let me sleep.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.931
Stay.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.189
Hello.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.950
Can I help you?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
My name's Sally.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.958
I'm a librarian here.
What's your name?

08:21.335 --> 08:22.794
I'm Alice.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.839
Alice Hart.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.016
How old are you?

08:36.016 --> 08:39.061
I bet you're old enough
to have your own library card.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.562
Would you like one?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.860
There you go.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.159
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.036
Shall we have a cup of tea
and something to eat

08:56.036 --> 08:58.622
while you decide which books
you want to take home today?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.833
I'll just pop the kettle on.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.430
Hi, it's me.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.975
Listen, can you come down here?

09:19.393 --> 09:21.603
It's definitely Clem Hart's daughter.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.314
In her nightie.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.568
She's got bruises
all over her little arms.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.738
She must have walked here!

09:32.906 --> 09:34.825
Please, John, just come down.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.978
You can call off that search
party. She's, uh, she's here.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.689
Lucky I came back a day early, eh?

10:05.689 --> 10:08.400
Yeah, she just walked right in
through the front door. She's, um...

10:08.400 --> 10:10.694
Yeah, she's safe and sound.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.070
Cheers.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.324
No, no. Thank you for calling, mate.
Thank you. I really...uh...

10:15.324 --> 10:18.118
Yeah, I really appreciate the...
the time.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.411
Bye-bye.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.469
- Clem, please!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.305
- It was my fault...

10:42.309 --> 10:45.354
-  Don't you ever do that again!

10:45.354 --> 10:47.314
Da...

11:50.335 --> 11:52.671
You let Daddy
do all the talking, OK?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.886
- G'day, mate.
- Hey.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.222
I apologise
for turning up unannounced.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.266
- Can I come in?
- Come on through.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.986
Can I get you a cup of tea or...

12:15.986 --> 12:18.405
No, no. Don't go to any trouble.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.074
- Sorry about the mess.
- No, no.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.202
Just following up
after Alice's visit to the library.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.497
Ah, yeah.
She's an adventurous little thing.

12:27.497 --> 12:31.793
Scared the pants off everyone,
but, uh, no harm done.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.006
Look, I won't waste your time.

12:36.006 --> 12:40.510
The librarian reported seeing
bruising on Alice's arms and legs.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.346
- Alice is always climbing trees.
- Roughhousing with the dog, mate.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.432
Gets herself covered in bruises.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.146
Is this your dog, Alice?

12:52.606 --> 12:55.025
What's his name?

12:55.025 --> 12:56.985
Toby.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.279
Toby to blame for all these bruises?

13:01.323 --> 13:03.325
He didn't mean to hurt me.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.918
Well, um...

13:15.003 --> 13:16.671
You left these behind.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.888
Sally wanted me to tell you they're
all yours for the next four weeks.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.556
And then maybe
Mum can bring you into town

13:26.556 --> 13:27.891
and you can borrow some more.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.770
That'd be good, wouldn't it, Alice?

13:35.357 --> 13:39.027
Right, mate, well, um...
How about I show you out?

14:34.082 --> 14:38.712
"At the end of its life,
the Phoenix would build a nest

14:38.712 --> 14:41.548
"before erupting into flame.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.926
"its body consumed by fire...

14:46.011 --> 14:49.639
"...only to arise from the ashes,
reborn...

14:56.104 --> 14:58.690
"...made new again."

15:39.230 --> 15:40.440
Alice.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.651
Alice.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.196
Alice!

15:46.196 --> 15:49.658
I'm taking Mum for her check-up.
We won't be long, poppet.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.577
You stay here, OK?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.705
Be good.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.419
See you later, bub.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.050
How about I bring you back
a photo of the baby

16:07.050 --> 16:09.302
so you can see
what he looks like in there?

16:11.846 --> 16:16.851
We'll pick you up some more books
from the library if we have time.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.812
Can we keep the selkie story?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.438
We've already read that.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.983
- Alright.
- Come on, Agnes.

16:53.513 --> 16:58.101
"Fire is an element that
requires three things to burn:

16:58.101 --> 16:59.894
"friction,

16:59.894 --> 17:03.440
"fuel and oxygen."

17:32.302 --> 17:34.721
- It's OK, Toby.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.157
-  Alice!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.493
- Alice!

19:21.578 --> 19:25.164
- Alice... Alice!

19:27.709 --> 19:29.460
Alice!

19:30.712 --> 19:31.838
Alice!

19:31.838 --> 19:34.382
-  Come back!

19:39.220 --> 19:41.139
-  Clem!

19:41.139 --> 19:43.141
Alice!

19:43.141 --> 19:45.268
Alice!

19:47.687 --> 19:49.355
Alice!

20:14.422 --> 20:16.257
Hi, sweetheart. What's going on?

20:16.257 --> 20:18.301
- A fire.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.803
- At the Hart house.
- What?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.847
Agnes was just here.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.684
Call you when I know a bit more.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.635
Alice.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.595
Alice, can you hear me?

21:15.316 --> 21:16.693
Sally?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.904
I didn't know you were friends
with the Harts.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.614
Oh...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.116
A bit.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.826
Well, it's good of you to be here.

21:30.123 --> 21:34.419
They're taking her to theatre.
Alice is already upstairs.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.451
What the hell happened
out there?

23:36.999 --> 23:38.835
Is this our fault?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.218
Agnes...

25:04.503 --> 25:06.380
Just brings it all back.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.343
Being at that hospital.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.307
She's in the same room
that Gemma died...

25:19.560 --> 25:20.895
I know.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.503
So we have two fires,
one in the shed.

25:45.503 --> 25:49.799
And the other, which killed Clem,
started here, in the child's bedroom.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.804
An accelerant's been used,
most likely kerosene.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.709
Excuse me!

27:08.461 --> 27:11.380
Uh, this is a crime scene.
I have to ask you to leave.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.094
I'm Clem's mother, June.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.348
I want to see my son.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.226
And I want to see his family.

27:27.605 --> 27:30.483
Alice still isn't conscious.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.109
But you can talk to her.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.446
She can probably hear you.

27:52.254 --> 27:56.258
Butterfly bush.
Butterfly Bush.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.761
Means second chances.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.975
She has multiple fractures.

28:04.975 --> 28:08.521
Her right lung is collapsed, and there's
damage to her trachea from, um,

28:08.521 --> 28:09.730
from a trauma.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.273
What kind of trauma?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.777
Looks like she's been choked.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.739
And the baby?

28:18.739 --> 28:21.450
We had him airlifted to
a neonatal unit in Sydney,

28:21.450 --> 28:24.203
but realistically,
a baby born at 25 weeks, 700 grams,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.664
without his mother...

28:27.748 --> 28:29.375
...the outlook isn't good.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.837
When can I bury my son?

28:35.172 --> 28:38.300
Um... Well, maybe we should take a walk.

28:40.302 --> 28:44.265
There'll be a coronial inquest.
It'll be months, I'm afraid.

28:47.101 --> 28:50.354
So... may I ask why you've had
no contact with your son?

28:55.943 --> 28:57.611
Did you know Agnes?

28:59.780 --> 29:01.240
Nope.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.160
And Alice?

29:05.828 --> 29:08.581
Clem sent me a cryptic message
nine years back,

29:08.581 --> 29:10.958
so I assumed there was a child.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.378
But he didn't leave a return address.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.508
Um...

29:20.718 --> 29:24.138
Let me know
when I can make arrangements.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.348
Yeah, of course.
Where are you staying in town?

29:26.348 --> 29:28.100
I'm not.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.536
She's gone home.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.374
I don't mean to judge...

29:52.374 --> 29:54.084
Really?

29:54.084 --> 29:55.628
What a cow.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.591
What's gonna happen to the kids?

30:04.011 --> 30:08.557
They need... They need someone
to care whether they live or die.

30:08.557 --> 30:12.228
Yeah, um, I'll, uh...
look for another next of kin.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.782
Agnes is dead, too.
They're both gone.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.162
I think he did it.

31:54.330 --> 31:57.374
-  What about the girl?
- In a coma.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.793
And the baby?

31:59.793 --> 32:01.420
Not going to make it.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.799
Oh, my darlin', I'm so sorry.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.096
- We need to tell Candy.

32:13.891 --> 32:16.101
It'd be better coming from you.

33:05.359 --> 33:06.694
Mum?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.206
Who died?

33:39.560 --> 33:41.228
What are you doing?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.107
She's not coming back.

33:45.107 --> 33:48.694
No point keeping it for her.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.906
You can't just erase Agnes
like you did Clem, June.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.033
And you can't erase their child either.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.828
She's our granddaughter!

33:57.828 --> 33:59.246
The best hope that child has

33:59.246 --> 34:02.499
is to get as far away from this family
as she can.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.670
Don't try and change my mind.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.446
I know you love stories.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.493
What shall we read?

34:42.623 --> 34:44.124
"Bluebeard"?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.504
Nope.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.798
Bluebeard can fuck right off.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.680
Rumpelstiltskin can...

34:58.680 --> 35:00.390
get lost too.

35:13.904 --> 35:16.907
I know this was
one of your mom's favourites.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.829
At least it has a semi-happy ending.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.923
"A long time ago on
the wild Scottish coast,

35:32.923 --> 35:35.509
"the selkies lived proud and free,

35:35.509 --> 35:37.636
"part seal, part human,

35:37.636 --> 35:41.473
"singing their magical songs
with the voices of angels."

35:47.521 --> 35:48.605
Good boy.

35:48.605 --> 35:51.525
-  Fuck you!

35:51.525 --> 35:54.403
-  "Every full moon,

35:54.403 --> 35:58.031
"the selkies would come to the surface
to shed their seal skins,

35:58.031 --> 36:01.785
"and dance, naked, under the moonlight.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.329
- "One night..."
-  "...a fisherman hid away.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.791
"He saw one seal woman so beautiful

36:07.791 --> 36:11.420
"that he wanted to have her
all for himself."

36:21.638 --> 36:24.391
"So while she danced
with her sisters,

36:24.391 --> 36:27.060
"the fishermen stole her sealskin."

36:28.186 --> 36:29.646
Arsehole.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.065
How did she get out of her skin?
Was there blood?

36:32.065 --> 36:35.277
Alice, let me read.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.320
OK!

36:36.320 --> 36:40.699
"When it was time for the
sisters to return to the sea..."

36:40.699 --> 36:41.783
Alice.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.752
Come and have a look, poppet.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.714
I even carved
some of your favourite flowers.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.016
It's red river gum.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.696
Well, I take it that means you like it.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.995
"So the selkie woman
went with the fisherman,

37:26.995 --> 37:30.457
"and, over time, she fell in love.

37:31.667 --> 37:35.879
"They had... two beautiful children,

37:35.879 --> 37:38.131
"a girl and a boy.

37:40.759 --> 37:45.430
"But not even her children could make
the selkie woman forget her skin,

37:45.430 --> 37:47.432
"her sisters,

37:47.432 --> 37:49.226
"and the sea."

37:58.110 --> 37:59.736
Alice!

38:02.614 --> 38:03.907
It's OK.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.868
Deep breaths now, Alice.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.580
Deep breaths.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.846
Alice...

38:28.390 --> 38:29.933
There was a fire.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.644
At your home.

38:34.187 --> 38:37.357
A terrible, terrible fire.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.360
I'm...
I'm sorry, Alice.

38:42.404 --> 38:46.533
Your mummy and your dad
didn't make it.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.211
I'm so, so sorry, sweetheart.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.641
But you're not alone.

39:13.101 --> 39:17.481
I'm here, and I'm going to
take care of you.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.443
I'm here.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.061
Knock, knock.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.649
Someone left a present for you
at the nurse's station.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.442
Don't know who.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.958
Harry Potter!

40:19.084 --> 40:21.211
You don't know Harry Potter?

40:21.211 --> 40:25.465
Well, they're only the most famous
children's books ever written.

40:33.140 --> 40:37.561
But we can only read... if you eat,

40:37.561 --> 40:40.522
because if you're eating,
you can come home.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.903
You're going to love it, Alice.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.281
It's so beautiful.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.408
You've got your room all set up.

40:51.408 --> 40:54.911
We're right by the sea,
with a beautiful swing in the backyard.

40:59.082 --> 41:02.043
These are my famous
chicken sandwiches...

41:04.004 --> 41:07.299
...lemon tarts, and homemade lamingtons.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.428
Like lamingtons?

41:31.114 --> 41:32.616
Morning, Bub.

41:35.452 --> 41:36.995
Is June coming?

41:39.581 --> 41:42.334
Nup.
She left hours ago, for the funeral.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.757
You could plant that one for Clem.

41:48.757 --> 41:49.925
This one's for Agnes.

41:49.925 --> 41:53.011
And I got the last old man Banksia
for the baby.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.347
Put it in between them.

42:06.233 --> 42:09.027
Your name will be
written in the stars, little one.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.791
You know it's OK to cry for him?

42:24.709 --> 42:26.211
I know.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.196
Hi, June.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.367
It's good to see you.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.745
We can walk in together, if you like.

43:41.745 --> 43:43.705
I'm good on my own, thanks.

44:39.469 --> 44:41.179
Alice...

45:03.576 --> 45:05.078
Alice...

45:33.523 --> 45:35.358
Mum!

45:39.612 --> 45:42.532
Mum!

45:42.532 --> 45:43.992
Mum!

45:50.915 --> 45:53.877
Come back!

45:55.420 --> 45:56.880
Mummy!

46:28.953 --> 46:30.622
Alice?

46:32.207 --> 46:33.791
Alice?

46:54.354 --> 46:56.523
- It's OK.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.650
It's OK, Alice.

47:02.195 --> 47:03.821
It's OK.

47:11.079 --> 47:12.580
It's OK.

47:22.257 --> 47:24.175
There you go.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.598
See you've met your grandmother.

47:47.282 --> 47:49.867
-  I never signed anything.
-  You can't do this.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.078
- I can, actually.
- No. We had an agreement!

47:52.078 --> 47:54.414
- I'm her grandmother.
- And you didn't want her.

47:54.414 --> 47:56.583
Sal, June's the only next of kin.

47:56.583 --> 47:59.836
The decision is hers to make.
I'm sorry. It's...

47:59.836 --> 48:01.129
It's settled, then.

48:01.129 --> 48:03.756
Surely you can stop this?

48:03.756 --> 48:05.466
This is...

48:05.466 --> 48:07.010
Alice.

48:07.010 --> 48:09.387
the doctors say
you're well enough to go home,

48:09.387 --> 48:11.889
so you're coming with me
back to Thornfield.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.559
So point out whatever
you want to take with you.

48:16.102 --> 48:18.771
I'd like to get going
before it's too late.

48:30.867 --> 48:33.411
Let's start with your box of books.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.754
I'll let you in on a little secret.

48:42.754 --> 48:47.675
These books were actually a gift
from your grandmother.

48:49.385 --> 48:52.347
Because she knows how much
you love to read.

48:53.765 --> 48:59.103
And I also know that she is going to
take very good care of you

48:59.103 --> 49:01.189
and keep you safe.

49:16.788 --> 49:18.665
I'll always be here for you, Alice.

49:20.541 --> 49:22.043
Always.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.634
Don't forget him.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.619
You must be Alice.

51:19.619 --> 51:22.580
Welcome. I'm Twig.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.707
Alice doesn't talk yet.

51:24.707 --> 51:27.543
We're going to put her
in the belltower room.

51:29.462 --> 51:31.172
You must be tired.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.343
Why don't we get you cleaned up,

51:35.343 --> 51:37.386
and we'll, uh,
get you something to eat?

52:12.630 --> 52:14.006
This is John speaking.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.178
Yeah.
I'll grab her for you.

52:23.015 --> 52:25.142
It's for you.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.644
It's a solicitor.

52:29.105 --> 52:30.731
Sally Morgan here.

52:39.407 --> 52:41.576
No, I did not know that.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.667
Well, I'll wait to hear from you.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.464
What's going on?

53:01.137 --> 53:05.391
Agnes changed her will
four months ago.

53:08.311 --> 53:11.647
In the case that June
was unfit or unwilling

53:11.647 --> 53:13.649
to take care of the children...

53:17.653 --> 53:19.614
...she named me as their guardian.

53:21.574 --> 53:23.701
W... Why would she do that?

53:26.621 --> 53:27.997
You barely knew her.

53:32.668 --> 53:34.253
I don't know.

54:09.038 --> 54:12.208
I know it's all very strange
and frightening right now, Alice.

54:13.668 --> 54:15.503
But you're safe here.

54:16.796 --> 54:18.547
And I promise...

54:19.799 --> 54:23.344
...I won't ever let anyone hurt you
the way my son did.

54:26.347 --> 54:27.807
Goodnight.

55:06.762 --> 55:09.265
I knew you wouldn't be able to
leave without her.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.686
I just promised I'd keep her safe.

55:16.063 --> 55:18.107
Can we do that, Twig?

57:29.405 --> 57:31.866
So, did your dad every tell you
about Thornfield?

57:35.911 --> 57:40.082
Do you really think that
a refuge full of traumatised
people

57:40.082 --> 57:41.542
is the best place for her?

57:50.926 --> 57:52.970
How could you?

57:52.970 --> 57:54.722
Alice... Alice!

57:57.683 --> 58:00.352
I am not losing another child.

58:04.607 --> 58:05.941
Were you ever going to tell me?

58:05.941 --> 58:07.234
How could I?

58:10.738 --> 58:13.824
I've never felt like this
about someone before.

58:19.747 --> 58:20.956
Were you part of it?

58:24.251 --> 58:27.338
There's plenty of time
to tell her the rest.
