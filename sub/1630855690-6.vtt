WEBVTT

00:38.914 --> 00:42.752
Let's say we do
go to the West Coast one day.

00:42.752 --> 00:46.422
We pack our bags,
get in our trucks and just drive.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.179
And we would buy a shack
in the middle of nowhere.

00:54.764 --> 00:58.225
And we can grow our own food
and veggies,

00:58.225 --> 00:59.894
be self-sufficient...

01:01.353 --> 01:03.606
...on the edge of the Indian Ocean.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.613
Just the two of us?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.952
And we can grow fat on seafood,

01:16.952 --> 01:19.205
make babies.

01:20.498 --> 01:22.833
Chubby-legged babies.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.592
I'd love that.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.650
I don't want it.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.984
But you're in pain.

01:48.984 --> 01:52.780
No, I have too much to do.
I need a clear head.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.782
Well, how about a joint instead?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.534
You could move up to
the hard stuff later.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.578
So you want me to get
lung cancer as well?

01:59.578 --> 02:01.705
I can make hash brownies.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.541
Tempting.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.584
You're just scared.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.796
Well, of course I'm scared, you witch,
I'm dying.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.925
Have you heard from Twig?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.887
Please let me tell her.
She needs to know.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.722
She has to find Alice.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.519
I'm getting up.

02:25.396 --> 02:28.774
I don't want her to come back
because she feels sorry for me.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.028
When she wants to come home,
she will.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.201
Do you ever take it off?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.913
Only in the shower.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.709
What was she like?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.670
The best bits of me are her.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.424
She loved nature.

02:57.887 --> 03:01.724
She talked to flowers and plants,

03:01.724 --> 03:04.435
gently, like they were
sleeping children.

03:06.562 --> 03:10.190
She looks softer than you.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.067
Not as feisty.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.744
Mmm, it was hard for her.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.833
She'd tell me she wanted to leave
before the baby, but...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.172
But then she'd shut down.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
A policeman came to the house once.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.058
She covered up my bruises
so he wouldn't see them.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.851
Why would she?

03:47.686 --> 03:49.605
She was terrified.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.733
Yeah, but you wouldn't have
attacked her in front of a cop.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.902
She could have spoken up,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.779
said something, you know?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.449
She could still be alive.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.126
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.987
Your daughter?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.075
Granddaughter.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.868
You seen her?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.161
Sorry.

06:10.496 --> 06:11.705
I'm Mary.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.333
Twig.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.753
So who's your mob?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.296
Don't know.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.965
I was brought up
in a girl's home in Adelaide.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.342
Any kids?

06:23.342 --> 06:25.052
Adopted daughter.

06:25.052 --> 06:29.014
And, um, I had two of my own.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.559
Got a photo?

06:40.025 --> 06:42.027
That's Johnny.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.529
And that's Nina.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.491
I hooked up with their dad
when I left the home.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.744
Nunga fella. Good fella.
Cultural man.

06:50.744 --> 06:55.332
I was just too institutionalised.
Didn't work out.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.417
Picked up with a whitefella then, and...

06:57.417 --> 07:00.170
It was fun for a bit, till he got nasty.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.298
One day we had this big blue,

07:03.298 --> 07:06.176
and that night I was working
a double at the cannery.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.096
And... he rung the cops.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.432
Said I'd gone drinking,
dumped my kids with him,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.560
happened all the time.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.523
Social services come real quick, eh?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.067
It's my word against his.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.819
Tried everything to get them back.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.828
Can I have one of them flyers?

07:32.828 --> 07:34.288
Sure.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.378
And fire duty's coming up.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.380
Mandatory training
will be added to your rosters,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.382
so please check the boards.

07:45.382 --> 07:49.803
And the Bush Bash Ball is on tonight.
I hope you've all prepared your livers.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.897
So, you coming tonight?

07:59.897 --> 08:02.274
Um... I don't know.
I don't think so.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.193
Oh, come on.
We never see you anymore.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.279
I know Dylan's allergic to a good time,
but you should come.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.198
Everyone dresses up,
dances all night.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.532
You'd love it.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.701
No, she wouldn't.
It's lame.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.662
I'm pretty sure Alice
can decide for herself, yeah?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.372
I'm sure she can.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.335
Please come.
I miss hanging out with you.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.920
Oh, I miss you too.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.634
It would be lame if I went by myself.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.466
Ready for date night?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.477
Babe, what's wrong?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.400
Dylan?

09:29.236 --> 09:32.155
I take it that's Lulu's slutty dress.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.994
What?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.669
Why would you dress like that?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.925
So all the guys from work
can wank over you?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.784
What are you doing?
It's late.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.246
I just... have to get these...

10:21.246 --> 10:23.290
few things down...

10:25.542 --> 10:28.128
...for you girls.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.839
- June.
- Mmm.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.467
You need to take something
for the pain, OK?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.052
And then I'll help you.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.762
That's the beginning of the end.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.348
I'm good.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.062
Read what you've done.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.816
Please.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.847
It's good, huh?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.140
Hmm.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.560
Oh...

12:09.938 --> 12:12.899
Crowd goes up at the SCG...

12:28.415 --> 12:31.626
- Alice, where are you, dude?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.757
- Hi, Alice! Come on!

13:16.004 --> 13:18.340
Morning, sleepyhead.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.971
Shit.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.720
June!

14:06.763 --> 14:09.432
Hey. Come on.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.642
Hey.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.519
Are you OK?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.198
My mother told me that one day

14:25.198 --> 14:29.369
I would carve someone's name
next to mine.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.039
And she said I was safe here...

14:34.624 --> 14:36.668
...to love whoever I wanted.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.971
I need you to write a letter for me.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.431
Mm-hm.

14:58.315 --> 15:02.027
♪ In the chilly hours and minutes

15:02.027 --> 15:04.070
♪ Of uncertainty

15:04.070 --> 15:06.364
♪ I want to be

15:06.364 --> 15:11.828
♪ In the warm hold
of your loving mind... ♪

15:13.246 --> 15:14.998
Her name was Robbie.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.459
Roberta.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.087
She was a bit older.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.551
I thought everything about her
was thrilling.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.021
We'd camp out by the river

15:38.021 --> 15:40.607
when her husband was away mustering.

15:42.025 --> 15:46.112
And we'd cook out under the stars,

15:46.112 --> 15:50.116
stay up all night, just talking and...

15:51.326 --> 15:52.994
...fooling around.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.753
I want her to know

16:01.753 --> 16:06.591
how grateful I am
for every second we had together.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.303
And I'm sorry we lost touch.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.645
- I like your shirt.
- Thank you.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.356
And your scarf.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.779
What was her last name?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.239
Baron.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.909
The Robber Baron?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.955
The one you told us was Clem's dad?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.374
Yeah.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.052
Look at your nails.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.436
Oh, my God, your outfit is
burnt into my brain.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.104
What can I say?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.022
Naked cowboy
never goes out of style.

17:05.650 --> 17:09.446
Oh, those cocktails were lethal.
I think I'm still drunk, to be fair.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.908
Alice!

17:15.744 --> 17:17.454
You poor thing.

17:17.454 --> 17:21.583
- I didn't know you got migraines.
- Oh, yeah, I hardly ever do.

17:21.583 --> 17:25.003
Well, I want to see all the photos.
Come on. Every single minute.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.338
- Every single minute!
-  Hey!

17:29.758 --> 17:31.593
This is for you.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.186
I hope it makes up for the headache.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.374
Do you like it?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.087
Thank you.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.300
Last night...

18:14.719 --> 18:17.055
I just freaked out. I'm sorry.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.849
I'm never going to hurt you.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.685
Ever.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.349
So they're looking for
their baby,

19:01.349 --> 19:03.977
and they were crying out,
but nothing, nothing.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.895
The baby couldn't even hear them.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.148
So we believe that
the mother is the evening star,

19:09.148 --> 19:11.818
and the father is the morning star.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.237
And they're still out there
looking for their little one.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.699
On some nights, you can see
the evening star changing colour,

19:17.699 --> 19:20.618
and that's the mother
trying to bring her baby back home.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.787
That's fascinating, isn't it?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.959
Alright, you lot, follow me.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.837
And don't forget about
the water bottles you filled up...

21:14.899 --> 21:17.735
- Hey.
- You alright, Mary?

21:17.735 --> 21:19.445
Yeah. We're going out bush.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.614
Just us womans and kids.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.993
Can I give youse a lift?

21:24.993 --> 21:28.579
See! I told you,
my ride always come.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.393
Hey, did you...?

21:50.393 --> 21:52.395
Was anyone asking after me today?

21:52.395 --> 21:54.272
Not that I know of. Why?

21:55.523 --> 21:58.109
Nothing.
I just thought I saw someone I knew.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.402
Hey, stay for a drink.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.695
You owe us one for last night.

22:00.695 --> 22:04.490
Hey, have one for me.
I said I'd help Sarah with the budget.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.451
- See you back at yours?
- Mm-hm.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.292
You have to go?

22:17.795 --> 22:20.131
Of course not.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.299
No.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.178
And after the day I've had,
I'd murder a beer.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.263
Hair of the dog. Perfect.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.921
Hey, Mary.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.131
I think I'd better get back
to Agnes Bluff.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.425
In case someone calls about Alice.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.219
Oh...

23:06.219 --> 23:08.096
Where are you going to go?

23:08.096 --> 23:10.932
Look here, it's night time.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.476
Have a feed. Stay with us.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.186
Yeah?

23:17.063 --> 23:19.440
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.739
You know that game you were
playing earlier with the kids?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.866
I used to play that with my kids.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.995
I reckon you'd be about
the same age as my Nina.

23:32.995 --> 23:36.290
I like that name. Nina.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.792
It's pretty.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.104
Dylan?

24:00.148 --> 24:02.024
Hey! Hi.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.068
Hi.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.778
Have you missed me?

24:08.239 --> 24:09.574
Dylan?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.205
Dylan.

24:25.173 --> 24:28.885
Come on, Pip.
Let's see if he's at our place.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.772
Oh!

24:47.653 --> 24:48.946
Ugh...

25:12.261 --> 25:15.264
Hi, you've got, Dylan.
You know what to do.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.974
It's me again.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.478
Can you call me back, please?

25:20.478 --> 25:22.438
I'm... I'm worried about you.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.512
Look,

25:54.512 --> 25:57.265
she's still looking for her babies too.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.304
Hey.

28:01.389 --> 28:03.099
I'm so sorry about last night.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.226
I got home late.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.061
My back was killing me,

28:07.061 --> 28:09.522
so I took some painkillers,
knocked myself right out.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.526
Did you have fun
with the gang last night?

28:16.904 --> 28:18.697
Hey...

28:18.697 --> 28:20.908
You OK, sweetie?

28:21.951 --> 28:25.621
Look, let's, um,
let's do a bush walk after work.

28:25.621 --> 28:28.707
Just the two of us,
pack a couple of beers,

28:28.707 --> 28:29.959
watch the sun go down.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.962
What do you reckon?

28:34.296 --> 28:35.965
Yeah, I'd love that.

28:37.675 --> 28:39.301
Got to go.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.514
Fuck, you're beautiful.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.812
What's up, guys?

29:07.788 --> 29:09.123
Hi, you've called Twig.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.250
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.399
Hi, I heard you were
looking for Alice.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.859
Yeah, I've got it here right now.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.111
- She's sitting on my...
- Fuck off.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.491
Hey, Twig. It's me.

29:44.575 --> 29:48.621
I know you're looking for me,
but I've found a home and a job.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.374
And I've met someone.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.877
And I'm so in love.
And I'm really happy.

29:57.046 --> 29:58.797
I don't want to talk to you right now,

29:58.797 --> 30:00.716
or see anyone from Thornfield.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.677
But I'll call you when I'm ready.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.138
So until then,
please respect my wishes,

30:06.138 --> 30:08.516
and don't try and contact me anymore.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.486
I know.
We're going to go for a walk.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.536
Hey, handsome, we're here.
Where are you?

30:28.536 --> 30:30.871
So the diesel bore is down.

30:30.871 --> 30:34.291
I'm going to have to stay back.
So no walk tonight.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.668
I'm sorry.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.712
OK, um...

30:38.712 --> 30:41.507
Well...

30:41.507 --> 30:42.967
I'll just hang here with Pip,

30:42.967 --> 30:44.885
and make us a yummy dinner
for when you get back.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.805
You're the best.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.807
Your face is the best.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.433
Love you.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.726
Love you, too.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.869
- Come on, Pip.

31:36.979 --> 31:39.481
He's home! Huh?

31:39.481 --> 31:42.276
Yeah. Come on.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.404
- Let's go!

31:45.404 --> 31:47.781
- Go find him.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.742
Hey.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.619
Where the fuck have you been?

31:53.954 --> 31:56.373
- On a walk.
- Yeah?

31:56.373 --> 31:58.208
Who were you with?

31:58.208 --> 31:59.335
Pip.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.048
Who the fuck were you with? Huh?

33:07.069 --> 33:08.404
Hi, June.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.639
OK?

33:35.639 --> 33:36.849
OK.

33:43.814 --> 33:48.068
I went to the address that
you gave me,

33:48.068 --> 33:51.363
and there was this
young couple living there.

33:55.784 --> 33:59.455
They bought it off of Ned Baron,
a few years ago.

34:00.622 --> 34:03.459
After his wife, Roberta, died.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.129
I'm so sorry.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.182
It's OK.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.310
It was too late.

34:23.604 --> 34:25.022
I just...

34:27.608 --> 34:30.652
I wanted to tell her...

34:30.652 --> 34:32.988
I didn't blame her.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.541
You know you can talk to me.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.170
I'm here.

34:59.973 --> 35:03.393
We were lying on the riverbank...

35:03.393 --> 35:05.604
just stretched out...

35:05.604 --> 35:07.689
letting the sun dry us off.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.316
Just...

35:09.316 --> 35:11.235
You know.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.528
Kissing.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.864
Not a care in the world.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.535
And I...

35:19.535 --> 35:21.245
I heard a noise.

35:22.830 --> 35:25.123
There were three of them,

35:25.123 --> 35:28.627
and I pushed Robbie into the river
and I said, "Go!"

35:30.087 --> 35:32.214
And I went in right after her.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.050
But they caught me.

35:36.385 --> 35:38.929
I didn't...

35:40.305 --> 35:41.849
Uh...

35:41.849 --> 35:44.393
I just couldn't keep them off me...

35:46.144 --> 35:49.022
...and...

35:49.022 --> 35:51.441
I couldn't breathe.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.531
And... and...

35:57.531 --> 35:59.283
I think...

35:59.283 --> 36:04.454
I think one of them
must have knocked me out.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.874
Oh...

36:06.874 --> 36:09.418
And when I came to...

36:11.044 --> 36:13.589
It was night.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.841
I hurt all over.

36:16.884 --> 36:19.553
And I...

36:19.553 --> 36:22.848
I was afraid they might
still be there...

36:24.016 --> 36:25.601
...wanting another go.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.062
And so I just...

36:30.230 --> 36:31.773
...kept...

36:31.773 --> 36:33.108
still.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.659
I never told the police.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.579
I never saw Robbie again.

36:45.579 --> 36:48.123
She kept calling, but I...

36:48.123 --> 36:49.374
I just...

36:57.215 --> 36:59.843
And when Clem was born,

36:59.843 --> 37:01.553
he...

37:01.553 --> 37:05.724
he just cried for a whole year...

37:06.975 --> 37:08.602
...like he knew.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.357
And then...

37:14.441 --> 37:17.402
Then Twig came,

37:17.402 --> 37:19.404
and she saved us.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.614
Yeah.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.952
Saved us all.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.874
I'm so sorry.

37:32.042 --> 37:35.796
I'm so sorry. That's so horrible!

37:40.676 --> 37:42.552
I'm so sorry.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.040
I'm so sorry.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.129
I don't know what happened.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.094
We just went for a walk.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.306
Please don't leave me, please.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.104
You don't see
how other men look at you.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.440
What if you're out there walking,

38:36.440 --> 38:39.401
and one of them sees you,

38:39.401 --> 38:42.237
and you start talking
the way we used to talk?

38:44.781 --> 38:47.075
He'll fall in love with you.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.956
'Cause you light up the room, baby.

38:58.295 --> 39:01.256
- I love you so much.
- I know.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.968
There's no room
for me to love anyone else.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.429
No! I know. I'm sorry.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.097
No! No! No!

39:09.097 --> 39:11.183
Stop. Dylan, stop, stop!

39:11.183 --> 39:12.726
Dylan, stop it! Stop!

39:12.726 --> 39:14.936
You're scaring me. Stop!

39:14.936 --> 39:16.730
I'm sorry.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.148
Stop!

39:18.148 --> 39:20.692
I love you so much.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.780
I know.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.327
I don't want to be that guy.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.957
I need you
not to set me off like that.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.170
Could you do that?

39:43.340 --> 39:44.966
For us?

39:47.844 --> 39:49.304
Of course.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.421
You're overdue for more morphine.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.257
Well, I don't want it.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.009
I just don't want to get all...

40:28.009 --> 40:29.553
doolally.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.351
What's going on?

40:57.539 --> 40:59.040
Stop.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.335
In words, not bloody flowers.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.842
My will is in the top drawer
of the desk,

41:08.842 --> 41:12.095
along with my wishes for the funeral.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.225
So, what?
You're... You're giving up?

41:19.060 --> 41:21.563
What about the flowers?
They need you.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.358
They have you.

41:26.776 --> 41:30.697
What about all the things that
you wanted to do on the farm?

41:30.697 --> 41:33.158
The new season's all been planted.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.676
Who's that?

41:53.929 --> 41:56.765
Someone from Thornfield.

41:56.765 --> 41:58.433
Thornfield?

41:58.433 --> 41:59.893
What did they want?

42:01.353 --> 42:04.189
She's travelling, she wants to see me.
But I told her no.

42:04.189 --> 42:07.234
She's keen.
But she leaves tomorrow.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.611
And you don't want to see her?

42:09.611 --> 42:11.488
- No.
- You sure?

42:12.781 --> 42:14.074
Yeah.

42:14.074 --> 42:17.494
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.037
OK.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.288
Only one.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.194
Hey, Bub.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.492
Darling...

42:57.492 --> 42:58.785
What's wrong?

43:00.704 --> 43:02.747
June's dying.

43:02.747 --> 43:06.334
She told me not to tell you,
but I can't do this on my own.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.378
And I think
she's going to kill herself.

43:08.378 --> 43:10.005
Please come home, please.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.882
Please, Mum, I need you.
I really need you!

43:12.882 --> 43:16.177
I need you to come and stop this.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.393
Mum, I need you.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.984
I'm coming home now.

43:30.984 --> 43:32.193
OK.

43:33.486 --> 43:35.530
You tell her...

43:35.530 --> 43:36.906
I'm coming.

43:38.366 --> 43:41.244
- Shh...

43:45.498 --> 43:46.916
Weather's in our favour.

43:46.916 --> 43:49.586
We'll be focusing on this area
just south of the main track,

43:49.586 --> 43:51.713
into the crater.

43:51.713 --> 43:53.506
Remember, burn into the wind,

43:53.506 --> 43:55.759
and always be mindful of where you are.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.344
Know your escape routes.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.095
And keep an eye out for each other.

44:01.431 --> 44:03.725
Hey, how you feeling? You OK?

44:05.435 --> 44:07.812
You'll be good.

44:07.812 --> 44:11.316
Hey, Dylan. Dylan, that
diesel bore's gone down again.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.109
I need you back at base.

44:13.109 --> 44:14.611
Quick sticks.

44:14.611 --> 44:17.447
Yeah, um... Sure.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.159
Uh... Alice. Alice.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.119
Um, you stick with Aiden, right?

44:23.119 --> 44:24.662
Aiden?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.164
He'll show you the ropes.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.083
You ready?

45:37.652 --> 45:39.112
Alice, are you alright?

45:40.155 --> 45:41.489
OK?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.367
- Take a deep breath.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.244
Deep breath. That's it.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.080
You're good.

45:53.001 --> 45:54.586
Have a drink.

45:55.795 --> 45:58.006
I can radio someone to take you back.

45:59.257 --> 46:00.633
No, I'm good.

46:00.633 --> 46:02.135
- You sure?
- Yeah.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.014
Yeah, I can...

46:06.014 --> 46:07.599
I can see it through.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.311
Alright. Stay close to me.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.967
Hey, Alice.

46:45.470 --> 46:49.307
Look, I know how rough
it was for you out there today.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.770
Yeah, I don't know what
gave you that impression.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.233
Thanks for all your help.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.111
Just take it easy, eh?

47:58.585 --> 48:00.295
Well, it went well.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.508
I didn't completely
humiliate myself.

48:07.969 --> 48:11.472
Of course it went well,
because you're amazing.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.435
You're perfect
and everyone loves you.

48:23.484 --> 48:25.987
With those big eyes,

48:25.987 --> 48:28.281
and the butterflies.

48:28.281 --> 48:30.742
People can't get enough of you,
can they?

48:31.909 --> 48:34.871
And you play them
like a fucking song.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.836
Go on.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.881
Tell me.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.594
Come on!

48:49.594 --> 48:50.845
Tell me.

48:52.013 --> 48:53.431
Tell me all about it.

48:54.557 --> 48:56.976
How you wrapped your arms
around Aiden.

48:56.976 --> 48:58.269
Wasn't like that.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.979
How you cosied up to him.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.648
Hmm?

49:01.648 --> 49:03.024
You have to understand...

49:03.024 --> 49:04.275
Don't fucking lie to me!

49:04.275 --> 49:06.069
- Please, please, please...
- Please, please...!

49:09.030 --> 49:11.449
Is that what you wanted? Hmm?

49:12.784 --> 49:15.286
You fucking prick tease!

49:15.286 --> 49:16.788
- Please stop!
- Leading him on.

49:18.039 --> 49:19.999
Getting him to fight over you?

49:19.999 --> 49:21.584
Get off!

49:21.584 --> 49:22.794
Stop!

49:22.794 --> 49:24.462
Stop!

49:25.755 --> 49:28.716
Is he the one who's been texting you?

49:30.593 --> 49:32.053
Agh!

49:32.053 --> 49:33.680
See what you make me do?

49:37.475 --> 49:38.851
Agh!

50:09.757 --> 50:11.259
Fuck.

50:22.937 --> 50:25.314
You're so fucking dangerous.

50:27.066 --> 50:29.277
I mean...

50:29.277 --> 50:31.237
you killed your own parents.

51:41.224 --> 51:42.975
Run round the front!

51:42.975 --> 51:44.435
Don't look back!

52:51.460 --> 52:53.421
- Come on, Pip. Let's go.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.307
Come in, quick, come in.

53:29.081 --> 53:30.458
Bub.

53:32.043 --> 53:33.628
It's going to be OK.

53:35.504 --> 53:39.342
Just breathe. Just breathe.

53:39.342 --> 53:42.094
It's going to be OK, Alice,
just trust me.

53:46.849 --> 53:49.769
- Just open the door and let him in.

53:49.769 --> 53:51.896
Tell him you're sorry.

53:51.896 --> 53:53.230
Don't upset him, Alice!

53:53.230 --> 53:54.982
Come on,
I just want to talk to you.

53:54.982 --> 53:56.609
You don't know what he might do.

53:56.609 --> 53:57.985
Alice, I want to talk.

53:59.070 --> 54:00.905
We just need to talk, Alice.

54:00.905 --> 54:02.823
- Are you listening?
- Let's just talk, OK?

54:02.823 --> 54:04.784
Just open the door.

54:04.784 --> 54:06.994
Open the door!

54:06.994 --> 54:08.329
Alice!

54:09.747 --> 54:11.874
Alice, look at me.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.126
- Please!
-  Open the fucking door!

54:14.126 --> 54:16.045
Please, Alice, you're just
going to make it worse.

54:16.045 --> 54:17.296
Please.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.590
- Please.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.676
He's just going to get angrier
and it's just going to get worse.

54:21.676 --> 54:24.178
You need to let him in now.
Alice, just trust me!

54:24.178 --> 54:27.056
It's all gonna be OK,
just let him in...

54:27.056 --> 54:29.183
Bub, just, please...

54:29.183 --> 54:32.395
- Look at me.

54:35.439 --> 54:37.024
Alice!

54:37.024 --> 54:38.985
Open the fucking door
right now!

54:38.985 --> 54:40.820
Alice, you're not listening!

54:43.447 --> 54:44.991
Let him in.

54:46.033 --> 54:48.494
Let him in, Alice!

54:57.878 --> 54:59.171
It's Twig.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.841
I know you said not to contact you,

55:01.841 --> 55:05.011
and I know how angry
you must have been when you left.

55:05.011 --> 55:07.263
But there's things
you need to know, Alice.

55:08.514 --> 55:11.225
Things I can't leave in a message, bub.

55:13.144 --> 55:15.521
We all love you so much.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.399
And we miss you terribly.

55:20.151 --> 55:21.736
Take care, darling girl.
