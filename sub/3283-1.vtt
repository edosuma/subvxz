00:49.840 --> 00:51.775
I can't believe we
gotta do this shit, man.

00:51.776 --> 00:53.444
This thing's been in the
ground three fuckin' months.

00:53.445 --> 00:55.680
- You know what it's gonna smell like?
- Yeah, I know.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.915
Stop bitching and let's just
get this thing outta here.

01:02.285 --> 01:05.856
I remember about 10 years
ago, I had to do the same shit.

01:05.857 --> 01:09.258
I almost died from
the fucking stench.

01:10.194 --> 01:13.763
Oh, God. Here.

01:14.565 --> 01:18.169
All right. Let's do this.

01:30.214 --> 01:34.617
Oh, fuck. I'm gonna
break my neck out here.

01:37.521 --> 01:42.725
- Hey, Danny. How much further?
- Not far... just keep walking.

01:46.430 --> 01:49.633
- What the fuck?
- What is that?

01:49.634 --> 01:52.336
Do you think some kind of animal
or something could have did this?

01:52.337 --> 01:54.605
How the fuck is an animal
gonna dig a hole like that?

01:54.606 --> 01:56.361
Louie, gimme that
flashlight. Carmine.

01:56.387 --> 01:57.942
- What?
- Come here.

01:57.943 --> 02:01.310
Go down and see if
there is anything there.

02:01.979 --> 02:04.546
- Cock.
- Thank you.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.752
Louie, help me out. I'm
not a fucking kangaroo.

02:11.223 --> 02:14.925
There ain't nothing down here.
And I don't smell nothing neither.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.995
Really, Carmine? You don't
smell a rat down there?

02:21.699 --> 02:24.800
- Big "V" sends his regards.
- Louie! Louie, Louie, Louie!

02:30.641 --> 02:34.610
Let's bury the rat and just
get the fuck outta here.

02:37.148 --> 02:38.782
I don't even know
where the fuck we are.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.018
Why'd we have to come all
the way out here to do this?

02:41.019 --> 02:43.954
We've been burying pricks
like this out here for years.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.558
If these woods could only
talk, we'd all be in the can.

03:19.557 --> 03:20.824
Who's over there?

03:22.494 --> 03:23.661
Danny, look out!

03:23.662 --> 03:25.296
Danny, no!

05:30.954 --> 05:33.023
That is so pretty,
you're gonna look so hot.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.060
Pull it down, you don't wanna
give away the milk for free.

05:37.061 --> 05:38.762
It'll get so much
lighter with the sun.

05:38.763 --> 05:41.064
You have such a
nice butt, like J.Lo.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.935
Right here.

05:53.144 --> 05:57.448
- Can somebody pick up the phone?
- Why don't you answer the phone, bitch?

05:57.449 --> 05:58.882
Don't you dare call her bitch.

05:58.883 --> 06:01.785
I'll shove this curling iron right
up your fat fucking ass, bitch.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.819
I'll get the phone.

06:08.992 --> 06:13.163
A Touch of Class, Teresa speaking.
Hold on... Ricardo.

06:13.164 --> 06:17.501
It's for you. He says
that his name is Monty.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.502
Ugh.

06:21.739 --> 06:25.142
Excuse me. Who do you think
you are, calling me at work?

06:25.443 --> 06:30.812
Oh, no, and don't ever call me
again! Yech! <i> Ay, Dios mio.</i>

06:31.615 --> 06:33.684
- I like this outfit...
- Who's Monty?

06:33.685 --> 06:37.687
Oh, some pig I met online last night.
We were chatting for just 10 minutes

06:37.713 --> 06:40.757
and he expects me to drive
to his place at 1:00 a.m.

06:40.758 --> 06:43.694
I said, "No, you can't
just pick up the phone

06:43.695 --> 06:47.564
"and send for me in the middle of the night.
What do you think I am, Pizza Slut?"

06:48.833 --> 06:50.901
<i>Mira</i>, I have a picture of the slob.

06:50.902 --> 06:52.603
- Ugh.
- Is it the full Monty?

06:52.604 --> 06:53.770
Yeah, that's the pig.

06:54.906 --> 06:58.309
He's cute. Should have called
me last night. I deliver.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.878
Listen, honey, unless
your pizza has pepperoni,

07:00.879 --> 07:02.846
don't even bother
heating up your oven.

07:04.548 --> 07:06.617
Come on, Dina. I want
to beat the traffic.

07:06.618 --> 07:09.286
All done. Let me
just get my things.

07:09.287 --> 07:11.588
Where the hell are you two going?

07:11.589 --> 07:14.525
Down the shore for a girls'
weekend of sun and sin.

07:15.827 --> 07:17.794
Maybe the two of
youse can either drown

07:17.795 --> 07:20.731
or get eaten by a shark and
make it a holiday for all of us.

07:20.732 --> 07:24.635
Heh, or who knows? Maybe we'll find a
beached whale and name her Christy.

07:24.636 --> 07:28.739
Oh, sounds like fun. And while
you're looking for Mr. Right,

07:28.740 --> 07:31.074
Dina can sample all
the Mr. Right Nows.

07:32.310 --> 07:33.777
You said it, not me.

07:33.778 --> 07:35.812
- Whatever.
- I'm out of here.

07:35.813 --> 07:37.681
I just kidding...
you know you fabulous.

07:37.682 --> 07:41.818
- You look so pretty. You look so good.
- I tell her that every time.

07:41.819 --> 07:43.687
It's like a shelf up here.
They just hold up.

07:43.688 --> 07:44.955
I don't know how she does it.

07:44.956 --> 07:47.558
- I made it!
- Hey!

07:47.559 --> 07:48.859
- Mwah!
- Hey!

07:48.860 --> 07:52.062
- Oh, you're not working today, Gigi.
- You got that right.

07:52.063 --> 07:55.632
Oh, chica, you too? Wait, am
I the only girl not going?

07:55.633 --> 07:59.836
- Next time, we'll invite you, I promise.
- What am I gonna do this weekend?

07:59.837 --> 08:01.104
- Aww.
- I don't know.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.006
Maybe you should ask Monty.

08:03.007 --> 08:06.643
You get out of here,
you... Good-bye.

08:10.381 --> 08:12.916
Hello, Monty?

08:13.317 --> 08:15.652
Yes, I'll taste your chorizo.

08:16.654 --> 08:19.156
Come on!

08:19.157 --> 08:21.258
Come on, Gigi, let's go!

08:21.259 --> 08:23.894
All right, Dina, she's
coming, she's coming.

08:23.895 --> 08:26.330
Come on, Gigi, we want
to beat the traffic.

08:26.331 --> 08:29.331
Okay, Seaside
Heights, here we come!

08:30.334 --> 08:32.369
Michael, what are you doing here?

08:32.370 --> 08:35.606
I was just driving by, and I saw your
mother drop you off. Where you going?

08:35.607 --> 08:38.609
Not that it's any of your business, but I'm
going down the shore to see the girls.

08:38.610 --> 08:40.943
Well, I might be there too. So
maybe we should all hook up.

08:40.945 --> 08:42.679
That is so not happening, Michael.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.682
I just don't want you going down the
shore with a car full of single girls.

08:45.683 --> 08:47.684
Would you rather I go in
a car full of single guys?

08:47.685 --> 08:50.921
Don't be stupid, Gigi, you know you're
still my girl. Show me a little love.

08:50.922 --> 08:54.191
It's not happening, Michael! Now, go
do something with Tony and Fat Angelo,

08:54.192 --> 08:56.227
- and I'll call you on Monday.
- So it's like that?

08:56.228 --> 08:59.096
- Yeah, Michael, it's exactly like that!
- Yeah, it's like that.

08:59.097 --> 09:01.665
- Dina!
- What... he's a dick.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.266
- Dina!
- Hey, fuck you, Dina!

09:03.267 --> 09:07.771
Yeah, fuck all youse! You're gonna regret
this day, Gigi. Remember I said that.

09:07.772 --> 09:10.040
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Means drop dead!

09:10.041 --> 09:12.408
Fuck off, Michael!

09:17.081 --> 09:19.750
- What the fuck, Gigi?
- I don't know.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.385
I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing anymore.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.388
I mean, one minute, I think
I love him, and then the next,

09:24.389 --> 09:26.957
I wanna knock his fucking head
off and throw it in the river.

09:26.958 --> 09:30.193
- Like right now?
- Yes, I think so.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.030
But he really is sweet,
though, don't youse think?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.499
- So are you single or what?
- Yeah, right now, I am.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.668
You don't see no fucking
ring on my finger, do you?

09:37.669 --> 09:39.870
No, but if you really
think that there's a chance

09:39.871 --> 09:43.273
for you and Michael, don't go hooking
up with every guy in New Jersey

09:43.274 --> 09:45.242
just to prove to
yourself you're single.

09:45.243 --> 09:46.743
Fuck you, Dina!

09:46.744 --> 09:48.779
No, no, no, no,
no... I'm with Gigi.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.181
Until you're married, you
do whatever the hell you want

09:51.182 --> 09:53.932
with whoever the hell you want,
whenever the hell you want,

09:53.958 --> 09:56.854
'cause guess what, Teresa?
Life's just too fuckin' short.

09:56.855 --> 10:00.457
Okay... next topic. When are the
girls meeting us down in Seaside?

10:00.458 --> 10:04.690
Uh, Joanne said that she, Candi, and
Val left Brooklyn almost an hour ago,

10:04.716 --> 10:08.131
and that Val's cousin Rosemarie
can't make it till tomorrow night.

10:08.132 --> 10:12.135
So in other words, they could
have stopped for hot dogs.

10:12.136 --> 10:14.604
Or they're banging three
guidos at a turnpike rest stop.

10:14.605 --> 10:16.738
Eww.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.378
Oh, my God, speak of
the fucking devil.

10:23.815 --> 10:25.716
- Almost fucking killed us.
- Oh, my God.

10:25.717 --> 10:28.414
You should have seen the old
man's face at the toll booth.

10:28.415 --> 10:30.185
He was so funny, ha!

10:30.188 --> 10:34.424
- Put your tops back on and follow us.
- Yeah, Jersey Shore!

11:14.798 --> 11:17.067
Are you sure this is
the right house, Dina?

11:17.068 --> 11:19.501
Yeah, I'm fuckin' sure.

11:21.204 --> 11:23.338
Come on.

11:24.207 --> 11:27.077
Hello? What do you think
you're doing here?

11:27.078 --> 11:29.913
Excuse me? This is our rental.

11:29.914 --> 11:32.382
- What are you doing here?
- Nice try, chonga.

11:32.383 --> 11:35.919
This is our house, so get the hell out.
Take your little rat dog with you.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.121
Who are you calling chonga, <i>bruja?</i>

11:38.122 --> 11:40.524
Don't be scared, Pico.
I won't let her eat you.

11:40.525 --> 11:44.828
I'm calling all of youse chonga. And
I'm calling the owner right now.

11:44.829 --> 11:49.366
You no have to call, okay? He lives right
there, and I just gave him our check.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.368
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:51.769 --> 11:55.470
We'll see about that. Girls.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.954
Well... Hello there, ladies.

12:10.955 --> 12:13.490
I'm Ronnie... what
can I do you for?

12:13.491 --> 12:15.358
Yeah, Ronnie, we spoke
on the phone a month ago

12:15.359 --> 12:18.161
to confirm our reservation for
the house this weekend.

12:18.562 --> 12:22.499
Oh, yeah! Your friend just gave
me a check, so we're cool.

12:22.500 --> 12:26.303
- Romero, right?
- No... Romano.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.305
Dina Romano, you idiot.

12:28.306 --> 12:31.975
Romano. You're not all together?

12:31.976 --> 12:35.312
Uh, give me a minute. Don't
go away... hold on, just wait.

12:35.313 --> 12:37.746
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:45.421 --> 12:50.060
Here it is. You're Romano.
They're Romero.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.995
<i>♪ Romano, Romero, Romano ♪</i>

12:51.996 --> 12:56.499
You're two different parties.
That explains everything.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.701
Fine... so can you get those
chongas out of our house,

12:58.702 --> 13:01.238
so we can finally
shower and unpack?

13:01.239 --> 13:05.499
I'm afraid I can't do that,
and here's why. You see,

13:05.525 --> 13:10.213
I already gave them the keys, and
then now they take over the house.

13:10.214 --> 13:13.149
That's the law. See, the house
is not mine, it's theirs.

13:13.150 --> 13:16.052
I know it's a little peculiar, but
it's how they do it in Jersey.

13:16.053 --> 13:19.556
Now that every house and hotel are
booked, where are we supposed to go?

13:19.557 --> 13:23.093
Nice going, Ronnie. You
managed to fuck us all.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.196
Hold on... hold on, hold on. Why don't
you guys just stay here with me?

13:26.197 --> 13:27.631
Excuse me?

13:28.900 --> 13:34.158
Look, I can find ways of keeping
you girls reasonably...

13:34.184 --> 13:38.141
- entertained.
- Ugh!

13:38.842 --> 13:42.678
I'll take that as a no. Or
I'll take it as a maybe.

13:43.813 --> 13:48.517
Their loss. Okay,
pot, it's you and me.

13:52.056 --> 13:57.594
That bitch think she's better than me
just because she has fake tits. Huh!

13:57.595 --> 14:02.365
I don't speak Mexican or Puerto Rican, but
I know they definitely talking about us.

14:02.366 --> 14:03.967
Fuckin' nightmare.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.270
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

14:07.271 --> 14:11.141
If that chonga gives me one more look,
I swear, I'm gonna fuck her up.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.710
Who would believe that someone
could screw something up so bad?

14:13.711 --> 14:17.380
- Are you trying to say this is my fault?
- Well, whose fault is it?

14:21.952 --> 14:26.355
Oh, my God, your little fucking rat
dog just pissed on my fucking leg!

14:27.557 --> 14:32.095
Thanks for telling me. I gotta go
now and disinfect his pee pee.

14:32.096 --> 14:36.199
Oh, my God, you're the best!
Thank you! Thank you!

14:37.234 --> 14:38.234
Uh-huh.

14:38.235 --> 14:40.003
Ugh!

14:40.004 --> 14:42.739
- Everybody back in the car.
- Where are we going?

14:42.740 --> 14:44.341
- My Uncle Vito's house.
- Where's that?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.210
About 15 miles west of here.

14:46.236 --> 14:48.611
Do any of youse have a napkin?

14:48.612 --> 14:50.512
Follow us.

14:58.054 --> 14:59.756
Whoo!

14:59.757 --> 15:02.424
Kiss my ass, chonga!

15:16.739 --> 15:19.474
Gnaw on some meat?

15:27.384 --> 15:30.653
Do they even know where we're
going, or are we just lost?

15:30.654 --> 15:33.273
I'll tell you right now, we're
going straight back to Brooklyn

15:33.299 --> 15:35.959
if she thinks we're staying at a
fucking campsite all weekend.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.761
<i>Your news for Ocean County.</i>

15:37.762 --> 15:41.464
<i>Human remains were found today in the
Pine Barrens section of New Jersey.</i>

15:41.465 --> 15:46.202
<i>According to detectives, the victims were
alleged members of the Rubino crime family.</i>

15:46.203 --> 15:51.640
<i>Details of how this will affect the upcoming
trial of Big "V" Rubino, coming up.</i>

15:55.177 --> 15:59.514
- Wow.
- This ain't no campsite.

16:06.089 --> 16:08.557
Where the hell are we?

16:08.558 --> 16:12.095
We're right at the edge of the
Pine Barrens, that's where we are.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.364
So where's this Uncle Vito?

16:14.365 --> 16:18.101
He's at his home in Staten Island.
If he tries leaving the house,

16:18.102 --> 16:21.504
his ankle bracelet beeps, the cops
come, and he could be put in jail.

16:21.505 --> 16:24.808
So he's under house arrest?
I mean, what did he do?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.928
You know, he's an entrepreneur.
But because he's Italian,

16:27.954 --> 16:33.683
they keep harassing him for every
single thing he does. It's this way.

16:33.684 --> 16:35.584
Oh, wow.

16:38.688 --> 16:40.522
Here we are.

16:48.598 --> 16:50.800
You can put your stuff down here.

16:50.801 --> 16:54.237
Wow, look at all this stuff.

16:54.238 --> 16:58.442
This has all the Belgian whistles.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.643
You know, Teresa,
I know your uncle,

17:00.644 --> 17:03.012
and I can't ever see him
buying a house like this.

17:03.013 --> 17:06.749
- It was willed to him.
- Willed to him... by who?

17:06.750 --> 17:10.686
Some guy in the entertainment industry
that he used to do business with.

17:10.688 --> 17:14.590
- What happened to him?
- Uh, no one really knows.

17:14.592 --> 17:17.227
But since my uncle has
business in New York and Philly,

17:17.228 --> 17:20.396
he kept this place because it's
located right in the middle.

17:20.396 --> 17:22.898
What about the people
that live around here?

17:22.900 --> 17:27.838
My uncle says they're not really friendly,
unless they're trying to sell you things.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.606
Well, obviously,
they would be jealous,

17:29.607 --> 17:32.209
seeing how they live, and
then seeing all of this.

17:32.210 --> 17:36.213
It's pretty awesome... the only thing
we're missing now is a Jacuzzi.

17:36.214 --> 17:38.480
Hey, even better.

17:39.215 --> 17:40.683
Swimming pool!

17:42.419 --> 17:44.754
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

17:44.755 --> 17:46.422
Awesome!

17:46.423 --> 17:48.224
Perfect.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.828
Oh, my God.

17:51.829 --> 17:54.164
Oh, my God.

17:54.165 --> 17:55.897
Not too bad, right?

17:55.923 --> 17:58.768
Wow, you guys, we could
totally go swimming later.

17:58.769 --> 17:59.869
You guys can go.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.239
It's kind of dirty. Should
we call someone to clean it?

18:03.240 --> 18:08.643
Uh, no. I just have to clean the leaves off
with the skimmer and change the filter.

18:13.317 --> 18:14.884
Ew!

18:14.885 --> 18:18.488
- Where did that come from?
- He had to come from the lake.

18:18.489 --> 18:19.689
Ohh.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.858
Eww!

18:21.859 --> 18:23.493
What lake?

18:23.494 --> 18:28.363
Um, I think it's... that way.
Come on, I'll show you.

18:32.668 --> 18:34.604
Come on, little guy.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.214
This is not a good idea.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.152
Be free, little guy.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.627
- Saved your life.
- That's not funny!

18:57.628 --> 19:01.464
Teresa can't swim! She has a serious
fear of water, you stupid bitch!

19:01.465 --> 19:03.566
Fuck you, Dina. If you didn't
fuck up the beach house,

19:03.567 --> 19:06.171
we wouldn't be here right
now. I'm sorry, Teresa.

19:06.197 --> 19:09.439
It's okay. Let's just go back
to the house and unpack.

19:10.741 --> 19:14.709
- You okay?
- Yeah... I'm okay.

19:19.849 --> 19:25.155
Okay, so there's plenty of
rooms. I'll room with Dina.

19:25.156 --> 19:27.857
Gigi with Joanne, and Valerie
and Candi can share a room.

19:27.858 --> 19:30.793
- Uh-uh, I'm not rooming with Candi.
- Why not?

19:30.794 --> 19:33.429
- 'Cause she farts in her sleep.
- I do not.

19:33.430 --> 19:34.731
Yeah, you do.

19:34.732 --> 19:38.768
Okay, I'll stay with Candi, and
Dina can stay with Valerie.

19:38.769 --> 19:40.903
I'll just have to keep
my window open all night.

19:40.904 --> 19:42.605
Knock it off.

19:42.606 --> 19:44.040
Where's my cousin gonna sleep?

19:44.041 --> 19:46.709
Uh, if she shows up,
she can have the couch.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.745
- Good? Fine.
- All right, let's go.

19:48.746 --> 19:49.779
- Whoo!
- Good.

19:49.780 --> 19:52.815
- Come on, my little stinker.
- Oh, stop it.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.052
Uhh! This freaking bag is so...

19:56.053 --> 19:57.820
heavy!

19:57.821 --> 20:01.724
Just be careful. They already
started renovating downstairs.

20:04.528 --> 20:08.196
Sorry, Teresa. Was that expensive?

20:08.831 --> 20:10.967
You're not going to unpack?

20:10.968 --> 20:13.935
Ugh, I'm so fucking
tired, I'll do it later.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.908
What's that?

20:22.511 --> 20:24.314
What do you think it is?

20:24.315 --> 20:25.982
I know what it is, but really?

20:25.983 --> 20:27.963
Did you actually think you would
need that thing down the shore...

20:27.989 --> 20:30.453
I mean, you might as well
bring sand to the beach.

20:30.454 --> 20:35.558
Well, I don't leave home
without it, and don't touch it.

20:35.559 --> 20:39.060
Yeah, 'cause I'm just dying
to touch that skuzzy thing.

21:09.792 --> 21:12.026
My name is Edgar.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.800
Would you like to try
some of my sausages?

21:17.801 --> 21:19.869
No, thank you, Edgar.

21:19.870 --> 21:24.540
- Yeah, none of us eat meat.
- Yeah, we're all veterinarians.

21:24.541 --> 21:30.413
All you girls look so pretty
and shiny. Are you all sisters?

21:30.414 --> 21:36.319
I never had sisters. I have
a brother... he's a asshole.

21:36.320 --> 21:41.389
No, we're not sisters, but, um,
it was nice meeting you, Edgar.

22:04.413 --> 22:08.651
So instead of watching hot-looking guys
with washboard stomachs on the beach,

22:08.652 --> 22:12.088
we're gonna hang out with Edgar, the
300-pound axe murderer, instead.

22:12.089 --> 22:17.360
Just because he's big, sloppy, and weird
doesn't make him an axe murderer.

22:17.361 --> 22:20.130
So what are we doing
tonight? I'm getting bored.

22:20.131 --> 22:23.166
I'm not driving all the way back to
the shore in that traffic again.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.501
Fine, Teresa, what do
we do around here?

22:25.502 --> 22:30.640
Well, forget about going to a bar or a
club. Those things don't exist around here.

22:30.641 --> 22:34.076
Mm, there was that sign down the
road for that Jersey Devil tour.

22:34.683 --> 22:38.881
Are you kidding me? Walking around in the
woods, listening to stupid ghost stories.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.983
Well, we can either do
that or stay here all night

22:40.984 --> 22:43.186
while Edgar leers at
us through the windows.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.254
Who knows, maybe
we'll meet some hot guys.

22:53.897 --> 22:57.033
Well... Good evening, ladies.

22:57.034 --> 23:01.938
Would you like to take the,
uh, Jersey Devil tour?

23:01.939 --> 23:04.038
How much for the six of us?

23:04.707 --> 23:06.776
Uh... $7.50 apiece.

23:06.777 --> 23:12.114
Screw that... we want a discount.
Uh, $50 for the six of us.

23:12.415 --> 23:14.148
Fine.

23:16.151 --> 23:19.287
All right, soon as all
your group is here,

23:19.288 --> 23:23.433
we'll have Junior take
you on your tour.

23:23.459 --> 23:25.027
Is it scary?

23:25.728 --> 23:27.496
Scares the tar outta me.

23:27.497 --> 23:30.399
- Great, let's fucking go then.
- Okay, let's go.

23:37.107 --> 23:42.145
Okay, I hope we're all keeping our
eyes open for the Jersey Devil.

23:43.246 --> 23:48.684
What can you tell us about the... creepy
people living in the Pine Barrens,

23:48.685 --> 23:52.088
like cannibals, called Pineys?

23:52.089 --> 23:55.057
Well, there are people
that live around here.

23:55.058 --> 23:58.961
Yeah, we heard there are a few dozen Piney
families who are all inbred, illiterate,

23:58.962 --> 24:03.566
and very hostile towards outsiders,
living just about a mile down the road.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.835
Now that's creepy.

24:05.836 --> 24:07.770
- Hey, Junior?
- Mm-hmm?

24:07.771 --> 24:11.239
- Where do <i> you</i> live?
- 'Bout a mile down the road.

24:12.975 --> 24:18.564
Now, believe it or not, the
Jersey Devil was the 13th child

24:18.590 --> 24:24.820
of a woman named Deborah Leeds who
emigrated from London, England

24:24.821 --> 24:29.158
here to the New Jersey
Pine Barrens in the 1700s.

24:29.159 --> 24:33.195
Moving here from London and all,
was she able to learn English?

24:33.196 --> 24:36.766
That's a pretty good question. I'll
have to get back to you on that.

24:36.767 --> 24:42.351
But anyway, during a very
difficult and painful labor,

24:42.377 --> 24:46.108
Mrs. Leeds invoked the devil.

24:49.612 --> 24:51.814
And when the baby was born,

24:51.815 --> 24:56.652
it immediately grew into
a full-grown winged devil!

25:04.694 --> 25:09.765
And then escaped from the house
out into these Pine Barrens.

25:09.766 --> 25:11.299
Ohh!

25:14.069 --> 25:17.439
- Who keeps hitting my ass?
- No touching.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.842
Ugh... that's disgusting.

25:19.843 --> 25:24.180
There are have been hundreds of Devil
sightings throughout the years.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.015
I think these girls like us.

25:27.718 --> 25:31.787
There are six of
them and three of us,

25:31.788 --> 25:34.691
so you know what that means?

25:35.692 --> 25:38.227
Oh, my God.

25:38.528 --> 25:41.097
This could be the greatest
night of our lives!

25:41.098 --> 25:43.366
Shh... let's try
to keep them scared,

25:43.367 --> 25:47.770
so that they cling on to
us for safety, and then...

25:47.771 --> 25:51.340
- Back to the RV!
- Exactly!

25:52.776 --> 25:57.311
This is gonna be so amazing!

26:01.717 --> 26:06.421
...one in 1909 by
Councilman Wheaton,

26:06.422 --> 26:11.894
who heard flapping wings outside
his bedroom window one night,

26:11.895 --> 26:16.805
and then the next morning,
found large, cloven footprints...

26:16.831 --> 26:18.657
in the snow.

26:23.906 --> 26:27.176
Hi. Uh, m-my name is Henry.

26:27.177 --> 26:28.878
Uh, what's yours?

26:28.879 --> 26:31.814
- Joanne.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

26:31.815 --> 26:36.224
Um, are you girls headed
to the Sci-Fi Expo in DC?

26:36.250 --> 26:39.622
Uh, if so, we could
all go together.

26:39.923 --> 26:42.425
- Are you serious?
- Sure, uh...

26:42.426 --> 26:47.063
We even have a DVD
player, a microwave,

26:47.064 --> 26:49.230
and a queen-sized bed.

26:51.734 --> 26:54.702
Val, wait until you hear this.

26:56.705 --> 26:58.107
Cool!

26:58.108 --> 27:01.010
I think she's going to get all
her friends to come along also.

27:02.812 --> 27:05.480
- Try to keep them scared.
- Okay, okay.

27:07.182 --> 27:11.086
Hundreds of people have
heard the Jersey Devil

27:11.087 --> 27:16.025
rampaging through the
woods while shrieking.

27:25.835 --> 27:29.805
Or making blood-curdling cries.

27:35.612 --> 27:39.348
Some call it the Leeds Devil.

27:39.349 --> 27:43.452
Some call it the Wozzle Bug.

27:43.453 --> 27:49.992
And others call it the
Hoodle-Doodle Bird.

27:49.993 --> 27:54.864
Either way, no one comes
out here alone at night.

27:54.865 --> 27:57.266
Oh, God, I'm really feeling scared.
I want to get out of here.

27:57.267 --> 27:59.235
What are you worried about?

27:59.236 --> 28:02.204
I feel like we're being watched, and
I'm starting to freak out a little.

28:02.205 --> 28:04.073
Yeah, you guys, I wanna go back.

28:04.074 --> 28:07.042
Why don't you girls give us
your... your email addresses

28:07.043 --> 28:09.812
so we can put it on our phones now?

28:09.813 --> 28:11.180
Sure...

28:11.181 --> 28:13.449
Uh, it's getalife...

28:13.450 --> 28:15.284
- Getalife...
- at...

28:15.285 --> 28:19.555
yougottabefuckingkiddingme.com.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.757
What's with the mixed messages?

28:21.758 --> 28:26.328
I don't know. But it seems like every
girl we meet has the same problem.

28:26.729 --> 28:28.564
Help!

28:32.101 --> 28:33.869
Oh, damn!

28:33.870 --> 28:37.006
Oh, my God, somebody
give me their belt!

28:37.007 --> 28:40.441
- I gotta make a tourniquet!
- Oh, my God! Oh!

28:53.924 --> 28:55.825
Welcome to the country, girls.

28:56.426 --> 28:59.928
You kidding me? We're getting
the fuck outta here!

28:59.929 --> 29:02.998
That was so uncalled
for! Let me go!

29:02.999 --> 29:05.935
Come on, don't be
upset. It was all in fun.

29:05.936 --> 29:07.903
F-U-N, fun.

29:07.904 --> 29:11.907
No, it's stupidity.
S-T-U... pidity!

29:11.908 --> 29:13.075
Are you okay, Val?

29:13.076 --> 29:15.311
I want to get outta here.
I don't like being scared.

29:15.312 --> 29:16.312
Let's go.

29:18.281 --> 29:19.548
Hey, later, girls.

29:21.251 --> 29:23.285
Yeah, that's fucking great, man.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.388
Argh...

29:38.700 --> 29:39.902
Hey, you ready, Gigi?

29:39.903 --> 29:43.339
No... you guys go ahead. Mike's
gonna come pick me up later.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.041
I really need to see him
tonight. I'm sorry.

29:46.042 --> 29:49.578
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

29:49.579 --> 29:54.584
- Okay, I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

29:54.985 --> 29:57.953
She's ditching us for that
loser again, isn't she?

29:57.954 --> 30:00.623
She seems to love him, so
let her do what she wants.

30:00.624 --> 30:04.159
I don't buy that... I think Michael
just knows how to manipulate Gigi.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.595
He turns her into, like,
his little mental prisoner.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.365
Yeah, kind of like Stockholder
Syndrome or something.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.232
Mm-hmm.

30:10.233 --> 30:12.902
Hey, bitches, you
want some pound cake?

30:12.903 --> 30:16.639
- Oh, yeah, I'll take some.
- I can't even look at that.

30:18.808 --> 30:21.944
- Are you dieting, Val?
- I'm going to.

30:21.945 --> 30:26.482
I just took five laxatives last night to
help get my stomach down for the weekend.

30:26.483 --> 30:30.686
- Oh, my God.
- That really isn't good for you, you know.

30:30.687 --> 30:34.423
Ugh, well, I don't wanna look like a
stuffed sausage all weekend either.

30:34.424 --> 30:36.191
- Sure you don't want some?
- No.

30:36.192 --> 30:39.028
- You're just gonna shit it out anyway.
- No...

30:39.029 --> 30:42.564
I wanna have a six
pack for the yum yums.

30:42.565 --> 30:45.100
- Yum yums.
- Yum yum yums!

30:45.101 --> 30:46.934
It's hot as fucking here.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.711
Daddy!

30:55.712 --> 30:59.181
Wow, a jellyfish!

30:59.182 --> 31:00.582
Don't touch that.

31:00.583 --> 31:03.552
You could get stung
very badly by it.

31:03.553 --> 31:06.555
- Ouchie.
- Yeah, ouchie.

31:06.556 --> 31:08.490
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

31:08.491 --> 31:09.725
Ohh!

31:09.726 --> 31:14.430
Oh, my God! That took me
all morning to build!

31:14.431 --> 31:17.733
Well, build it somewhere else. The
thing just made me drop the ball.

31:17.734 --> 31:21.203
Are you kidding me? You have
the entire beach to play on!

31:21.204 --> 31:25.040
Because the people is over there,
and if we play over there,

31:25.041 --> 31:27.576
no one's gonna be able
to see us right there.

31:27.577 --> 31:30.566
So why don't you pick up
all your sand and move it?

31:30.592 --> 31:32.515
Over there! You feeling me?

31:32.516 --> 31:35.883
And take your faggot-ass
pail and shovel with you.

31:44.594 --> 31:46.927
Oww...

31:49.465 --> 31:51.333
Ouchie.

31:53.136 --> 31:55.569
What you looking at?

31:59.641 --> 32:01.343
There's no fucking parking.

32:01.344 --> 32:05.214
Well, if you didn't make us late, we
would have been here two hours ago.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.715
Fuck you, Joanne.

32:06.716 --> 32:10.652
- Can you both please stop it now?
- Stay the fuck outta this, Valerie.

32:10.653 --> 32:14.123
- Yeah, shut the fuck up, Valerie.
- Don't tell her to shut the fuck up.

32:14.124 --> 32:16.625
- Who the fuck are you?
- Bunch of pains in the asses.

32:16.626 --> 32:19.261
All right, guys, calm down.
We're already here.

32:19.262 --> 32:21.495
Ah, there's a space.

32:22.431 --> 32:25.734
Give me the handicapped pass in the
glove compartment, just in case.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.637
- We're not disabled.
- Just limp a little when you walk out.

32:32.274 --> 32:33.776
- Ready?
- Whoo!

32:33.777 --> 32:36.444
Here we are.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.647
Whoo!

32:40.917 --> 32:43.392
I was dying for one
of these corndogs.

32:43.418 --> 32:45.487
- Me too.
- Me three.

32:45.488 --> 32:49.258
- Hey, what about your diet?
- I don't wanna starve to death.

32:49.259 --> 32:52.161
Why don't we set up over here?

32:52.162 --> 32:56.065
No... I see where we should go.

32:56.066 --> 32:58.233
Yo, throw the ball!

32:58.234 --> 33:00.468
Hyuh! Freddy, you asshole!

33:01.670 --> 33:03.795
- Ooh la la!
- Let's go, girls! Come on!

33:05.408 --> 33:07.642
Let me out!

33:09.178 --> 33:10.645
Uhh!

33:10.646 --> 33:13.148
Gigi, get over here! I'm
not done with you yet!

33:13.149 --> 33:15.284
Well, I'm done with you, Michael, and
if you know what's good for you,

33:15.285 --> 33:17.586
get your ass off
Teresa's uncle's property.

33:17.587 --> 33:22.224
Gigi... you little bitch, get over here!
You know what, I'm done with you!

33:22.225 --> 33:24.992
Stop following me, Michael!

33:30.733 --> 33:32.634
I have to tell you, Tre...

33:32.635 --> 33:37.105
Despite the mix-up with the house, I think
this is gonna be a really good weekend.

33:43.779 --> 33:46.615
No, please, please! Help me!

33:46.616 --> 33:50.686
No, stop, please!
Stop, let me go! Please!

33:50.687 --> 33:55.491
And if not for you, we would've had to have
turned back yesterday and miss all of this.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.525
No, no, no!

34:05.033 --> 34:06.335
Thank you.

34:06.336 --> 34:10.172
You don't have to thank me.
We're all in the same boat.

34:25.353 --> 34:27.422
- That didn't take long.
- No, it didn't.

34:27.422 --> 34:30.259
Impressive, I have to say.
We gotta step up our game.

34:31.327 --> 34:32.661
Ah, ow!

34:32.661 --> 34:34.062
God.

34:34.063 --> 34:37.976
Teresa and Dina... This is...

34:38.002 --> 34:42.271
Tony, Joey, Gino,
Vinnie, and Freddy.

34:42.272 --> 34:44.873
- Hi.
- Hi...

34:45.646 --> 34:47.848
Oh, wow.

34:48.177 --> 34:50.179
- What is that?
- It's a mime.

34:50.179 --> 34:51.547
A what?

34:51.547 --> 34:54.216
What is he doing? Why
is he wearing that?

34:54.217 --> 34:57.486
- Dude, there's no window there.
- He's just pretendin', Tony!

34:57.487 --> 34:59.555
- Ohh...
- He is cute.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.323
I don't get it, either.

35:01.324 --> 35:02.858
Oh! Aww...

35:02.859 --> 35:05.327
Now he's hitting on her.

35:05.328 --> 35:08.397
Now get the fuck outta here, Bozo.

35:11.601 --> 35:14.636
- He's doing you, Gino!
- Gino, that's you.

35:14.637 --> 35:16.371
You gonna take that, Gino?

35:16.372 --> 35:17.906
Yo...

35:17.907 --> 35:21.677
Yeah, keep going. Really?

35:22.078 --> 35:22.778
Yeah.

35:25.615 --> 35:27.516
- One punch!
- Good night, motherfucker!

35:27.517 --> 35:28.984
- Now get the fuck outta here...
- Asshole!

35:28.985 --> 35:30.819
Before I throws you a real beatin'!

35:30.820 --> 35:32.221
Whoo!

35:32.222 --> 35:35.224
- Who's going in the water with me?
- I am, let's go!

35:35.225 --> 35:37.960
- Yo, Gino, go out for a pass.
- Hey, wanna catch some crabs?

35:40.796 --> 35:44.333
Hey, we're going to the Barnacle
Club later if you guys wanna come.

35:54.309 --> 35:58.285
There's something so relaxing,
you know, and elegant

35:58.311 --> 36:00.749
about the beach. You
know what I mean?

36:00.750 --> 36:03.919
- I just love the fresh air.
- Mmm.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.321
Those guys were kinda
hot, don't you think?

36:06.322 --> 36:09.825
- They were definitely hot for you.
- Ooh, yum, yum, yum.

36:09.826 --> 36:12.527
- Oh, my God!
- What?

36:12.528 --> 36:13.895
- Oh, I have to go!
- Go where?

36:13.896 --> 36:16.698
Uh, the laxatives are kicking in.
I have to go to the bathroom right now!

36:16.699 --> 36:19.534
Oh, my God, oh, quick, run up to
the boardwalk and find a restroom!

36:19.535 --> 36:22.671
Aah! Aah! Get out of the way!

36:22.672 --> 36:24.973
- What?
- I gotta go!

36:24.974 --> 36:28.644
- Oh, my God!
- Oh... my... God.

36:31.581 --> 36:33.048
Ohh.

36:33.049 --> 36:34.983
- Eww...
- Ohh.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.719
Look, Daddy, sea shells.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.689
Come on, Valerie. We've
gotta get ready for tonight!

36:42.891 --> 36:45.726
Hey, you got any more corndogs?

36:47.929 --> 36:49.463
Poopy.

36:56.438 --> 36:59.008
All right, we got dollar Jersey Devil
shots for the next two minutes,

36:59.034 --> 37:01.575
so go to the bar and get you some!

37:03.346 --> 37:05.547
- Here's to the king.
- What king?

37:05.548 --> 37:07.549
- Fuc-king!
- Fuc-king!

37:07.550 --> 37:10.385
Oh.

37:10.386 --> 37:13.655
So, fellas, who's gonna
pay for all these drinks?

37:13.656 --> 37:15.090
- He is.
- He is.

37:15.091 --> 37:16.391
- You are.
- You are.

37:16.392 --> 37:18.560
- I'm paying for the cab.
- I always pay for the cab!

37:18.561 --> 37:20.663
- No, you pay for the drinks.
- Hey, you watch yourself there.

37:20.664 --> 37:24.499
You gotta be faster than that to stay in
the ring with the Staten Island Stallion.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.769
Man, you got it all wrong.
If you weren't my boy,

37:26.770 --> 37:31.037
you wouldn't even make it to the ring.
Pa-pow! End of story, motherfucker.

37:31.063 --> 37:33.535
- Who's next?
- Bullshit!

37:33.561 --> 37:36.812
- You never popped nothing.
- How the fuck do you know?

37:36.813 --> 37:40.075
'Cause I've known you since we were 12,
and you have such a big fucking mouth

37:40.101 --> 37:42.217
that half of Staten Island
would have known about it.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.080
There would have been billboards
along the highway saying,

37:44.106 --> 37:47.456
"Gino Digideo whacked some
dude. Paid for by Gino Digideo."

37:47.457 --> 37:50.457
I like it. I like it.

38:01.403 --> 38:05.974
Yeah, let's do some more shots, buddy.
Let's get some more... which ones?

38:05.975 --> 38:07.008
Ohh!

38:07.009 --> 38:09.612
- What the fuck?
- I'll tell you what the fuck.

38:09.613 --> 38:13.415
That's for drugging and raping my friend
Tammy last week, you fucking dirty scumbag.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.517
Yo, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

38:15.518 --> 38:18.954
Yes, you do, and two other people saw
you drop a fucking pill in her drink.

38:18.955 --> 38:23.492
Yo, that bitch was DTF, so get the fuck
outta my face before I smack your mouth.

38:23.493 --> 38:26.061
I bet you would, you
fucking dirty scumbag.

38:26.062 --> 38:28.730
- Get the fuck out of here, you slut.
- You can't do that in here, come on.

38:28.731 --> 38:29.931
- You're out.
- Get off of me!

38:29.932 --> 38:33.433
- Bye-bye, you little twat.
- Peace!

38:34.102 --> 38:35.937
Works every time.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.640
Yo, bro, we gotta get another
bottle of that shit.

38:38.641 --> 38:42.042
All right, my guy's coming in
next week. I'll get a shitload.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.431
- Hello.
- How you doing?

39:02.432 --> 39:04.666
If I was you, I'd
be stalking me too.

39:04.667 --> 39:10.170
Oh... well, let's have a couple more
drinks and see who's stalking who.

39:14.443 --> 39:17.010
- After you.
- Thank you.

39:26.855 --> 39:29.655
Right now, I'm just working on my
demo, trying to get signed to a label,

39:29.681 --> 39:32.227
- you know what I'm saying?
- Get a label.

39:32.228 --> 39:35.630
What the fuck are you
laughing at, Dominic?

39:37.055 --> 39:42.103
Look at you, kid. Who we kidding?
You can't sing, you can't rap.

39:42.104 --> 39:44.072
You can't even play a
goddamn instrument.

39:44.073 --> 39:46.708
How the hell is a record
company gonna sign you?

39:46.709 --> 39:51.813
'Cause I'm that fucking down! Besides,
what the fuck do you know about records?

39:51.814 --> 39:53.949
You're just a part-time
manager at a nightclub.

39:53.950 --> 39:57.127
If I need the urinals or some
shit cleaned, I'll give you a call.

40:00.089 --> 40:03.124
- You don't know who the hell I am.
- That's the point.

40:03.125 --> 40:07.229
We don't know who the fuck you
are, and nobody else does either.

40:10.833 --> 40:12.866
I'll be back.

40:13.935 --> 40:20.108
So, I was just down in the ladies' room,
and it's, like, totally empty down there.

40:20.109 --> 40:25.981
Like, two people could totally have
sex and no one would know, but...

40:25.982 --> 40:29.885
that... that would be wrong, right?

40:30.953 --> 40:32.654
Oh, no.

40:32.655 --> 40:35.924
Yo, yo, yo, for the first
time in over two decades,

40:35.925 --> 40:41.730
give it up for the one, the
only, Jersey's own Italian Ice!

40:41.731 --> 40:43.632

43:50.786 --> 43:52.954
- Hey, all right!
- Fuck the police!

43:52.955 --> 43:54.389
Fuck the police!

43:54.390 --> 43:56.691
Hey, come on, come on.

43:56.692 --> 44:00.028
Hey, youse is all suspended from the
club for the rest of the summer.

44:00.029 --> 44:01.463
But they started it!

44:01.464 --> 44:03.665
- Yeah, but you threw your drink at her.
- It spilled!

44:03.666 --> 44:06.434
- Ah, get the fuck outta here.
- Motherfucker!

44:06.435 --> 44:09.971
We can't go out like this, so
let's just go back to the house.

44:09.972 --> 44:11.406
- Hey.
- Fuck it.

44:11.407 --> 44:14.742
- Hey, where youse goin'?
- Back to our house... you coming?

44:14.743 --> 44:16.911
- Yeah, we're going. Yeah, we're going.
- Just follow us.

44:16.912 --> 44:17.946
Come on.

44:19.781 --> 44:22.149
Let's have some fun now!

44:24.786 --> 44:27.789
How many times have you been
banned from this club before?

44:27.790 --> 44:31.392
- Ah, I've been banned, like, three times.
- Three times... no way!

44:32.394 --> 44:33.461
Shh! Shh...

44:33.462 --> 44:35.929
Shh.

44:37.165 --> 44:39.799
What the hell was that?

44:43.972 --> 44:46.307
- Someone's in the house.
- What?

44:49.145 --> 44:50.979
Who the hell are you?

44:50.980 --> 44:53.782
I'm Rosemarie! Val's cousin.

44:53.783 --> 44:57.252
- Rosemarie!
- Valerie, there you are!

44:57.253 --> 44:59.895
Everyone, this is
Rosemarie, my cousin.

44:59.921 --> 45:02.361
I texted her the address this
morning. I forgot to tell you.

45:02.362 --> 45:05.160
Thanks. Uh, how did
you get in here?

45:05.161 --> 45:09.297
The sliding glass door was unlocked, so
I just came in and made me some dinner.

45:09.298 --> 45:11.776
Oh, God, was I starving.
By the way...

45:11.802 --> 45:14.469
you're gonna need some more Super
Fudge ice cream and beef jerky.

45:15.971 --> 45:18.807
Yo, this place is fuckin' hooked!

45:18.808 --> 45:21.209
A little out of the
way, but hooked.

45:21.210 --> 45:24.379
What happened to Gigi? She should
have been back here by now.

45:24.380 --> 45:27.214
Maybe Rosemarie ate her.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.517
Watch it, that's my cousin.

45:29.518 --> 45:32.587
- Where do you keep the liquor?
- Screw that, where's the food?

45:32.588 --> 45:34.422
I'll nuke some fried chicken.

45:34.423 --> 45:36.456
- He's hungry.
- Yes!

45:37.858 --> 45:42.163
"Fat Camp Massacre!" This is
supposed to be the best movie ever!

45:42.164 --> 45:44.232
Oh, yeah, yeah, put it on.

45:44.233 --> 45:47.135
- Hey, I want a leg!
- I want breast!

45:47.136 --> 45:50.038
- I just want a piece of ass!
- Aah!

45:51.040 --> 45:54.108
Ooh... Oh, yeah...

46:09.425 --> 46:10.592
Roger.

46:11.594 --> 46:15.462
Roger. Roger!

46:17.598 --> 46:20.535
Roger! I smell pizza.

46:20.536 --> 46:25.406
I told you already. Stop thinking about
food, and go back to sleep, Keith.

46:25.407 --> 46:29.077
If they catch you eating at night one
more time, they're gonna kick you out.

46:29.078 --> 46:34.147
I don't care about that. I smell pizza,
I'm starving... I'm gonna find it.

46:51.933 --> 46:53.101
Cupcake!

46:57.305 --> 47:00.208
Ohh, I finally found you, cupcake.

47:00.209 --> 47:02.676
Mmm...

47:04.379 --> 47:08.916
Now where's that fucking
pizza? I'm starving!

47:11.386 --> 47:13.353
Pizza!

47:17.259 --> 47:18.660
Oh, my leg!

47:18.661 --> 47:22.397
I wouldn't mind being stuck in a bear trap
alone in the woods if it was with you.

47:22.398 --> 47:26.067
Ooh, who needs a bear trap when
I have handcuffs in my bedroom,

47:26.068 --> 47:29.003
- you sexy little ape, you?
- You little freak!

47:29.004 --> 47:30.271
- Uh-huh.
- Uhh!

47:33.642 --> 47:34.943
Oh, my God!

47:36.979 --> 47:40.682
- Bye! Whoo!
- Later, boys.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.762
Who are you?

47:44.788 --> 47:49.958
I'm Cupcake the Clown. And
you just ate my cupcake.

47:49.959 --> 47:53.061
So now it's time to cut a few
calories the old-fashioned way!

47:54.096 --> 47:56.397
Get me outta here, Mister.
Come on, get me outta here!

47:57.633 --> 47:59.100
Certainly.

48:01.603 --> 48:06.241
I'd smack that clown so fucking
hard, he'd be begging me to stop.

48:06.442 --> 48:09.110
Where are you taking
me, you big ape?

48:09.111 --> 48:13.114
- To the bedroom.
- We just passed it. Put me down!

48:17.351 --> 48:19.721
So... do you have a girlfriend?

48:19.722 --> 48:23.424
No, sweet tits. I don't
get burned like that.

48:23.425 --> 48:27.695
So why don't you do me a favor...
go into that bedroom.

48:27.696 --> 48:31.666
I'm going to the shower
and rinse off, okay?

48:55.256 --> 48:58.593
The Electro Beam 300? Classic!

49:21.650 --> 49:23.149
Ba ba!

49:41.069 --> 49:42.470
Yeah.

49:52.381 --> 49:54.348
You little freak.

49:55.751 --> 49:58.853
Oh, no. I'm a prisoner.

49:58.854 --> 50:01.487
Please, don't hurt me.

50:10.131 --> 50:11.798
What?

50:52.841 --> 50:55.576
I just wanted a slice!

50:55.577 --> 50:59.614
- Yo, get that fat piece of shit!
- Yeah, cry like a little bitch, fat boy.

51:23.204 --> 51:26.741
I can't take this shit.
Who wants to take a swim?

51:27.042 --> 51:28.409
Me.

51:28.410 --> 51:29.809
Let's go.

51:38.787 --> 51:41.956
Ha ha ha! Prepare to die!

51:46.728 --> 51:49.330
Ohh!

51:49.331 --> 51:50.932
Damn...

52:10.751 --> 52:13.353
Wait for me!

52:16.824 --> 52:20.561
I could totally see you as
becoming a lawyer. You know why?

52:20.562 --> 52:24.265
You got eyes just like the
guy from "Law and Order."

52:24.666 --> 52:27.835
Yeah, so maybe that's
what I should do...

52:27.836 --> 52:30.271
becoming a backstabbing lawyer
and make a lot of money.

52:30.272 --> 52:32.340
What about you?

52:32.341 --> 52:36.844
I could be your secretary. I got lots
of really sexy dresses and nice boobs,

52:36.845 --> 52:39.480
and I'm really good
at answering the phone.

52:40.081 --> 52:46.454
Val, Dina. Come over here so I can show
you the new pictures of Mr. Wiggles.

52:46.455 --> 52:47.788
- Mr. Wiggles!
- Ohh...

52:47.789 --> 52:49.322
You sit tight there.

52:52.359 --> 52:56.464
- Who the fuck is Mr. Wiggles?
- Rosemarie's pet ferret! Wanna see it?

52:56.465 --> 52:58.599
- Aww!
- Isn't he sweet?

52:58.600 --> 53:02.169
This is me and Mr.
Wiggles in the shower.

53:02.170 --> 53:03.404
Aww!

53:03.405 --> 53:06.040
Dude, what the fuck is wrong
with these fucking girls?

53:06.041 --> 53:08.409
I love that one!

53:08.410 --> 53:10.845
I'm not fucking putting
up with this shit no more.

53:10.846 --> 53:14.681
See, he's got a
personality like a person.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.087
Where do you two
think you're going?

53:21.789 --> 53:25.359
I'm taking my secretary...
to the boardroom.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.862
He wants me to take dick-tation.

53:29.498 --> 53:31.064
Oh, shut up.

53:53.654 --> 53:56.957
Get lost. We're trying
to have a conversation.

53:56.958 --> 53:59.327
- Freddy, come here.
- What?

53:59.328 --> 54:03.963
I don't know, I got a math question I'm
trying to figure out. Just get over here.

54:11.006 --> 54:12.373
What do you want?

54:12.374 --> 54:14.909
Look, Tony wants to get with Dina.

54:14.910 --> 54:17.745
I wanna get with Teresa, and you
wanna get with Valerie, right?

54:17.746 --> 54:18.746
Yeah.

54:18.747 --> 54:22.383
Well, there's four of them,
and there's three of us.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.751
So you know what that means?

54:23.752 --> 54:27.355
No one is gonna get with anyone until we
figure out a way to extract the grenade.

54:27.356 --> 54:28.556
Make it three on three.

54:28.557 --> 54:30.925
Hey, girls, girls, you guys...
you guys want a doughnut?

54:30.926 --> 54:32.988
No, the doughnuts are for
you, honey. We get it...

54:33.014 --> 54:35.351
you like to eat fuckin'
doughnuts all the time.

54:35.377 --> 54:38.666
No fucking way. I'm not taking one for the
team for the fifth fucking time in a row.

54:38.667 --> 54:41.402
- Oh, come on, Freddy.
- We got a better idea.

54:41.403 --> 54:43.404
Just start talking to
her as if you like her,

54:43.405 --> 54:45.740
and pretend you're interested
in what she says, right?

54:45.741 --> 54:48.542
Ask her to take you to the store,
like you gotta go get something.

54:48.543 --> 54:51.779
Yeah, use my car. Now, when you
get a few miles down the road,

54:51.780 --> 54:55.182
just open the door, let
her out, and drive away.

54:55.183 --> 54:58.886
Yeah, but then when she finds her way
back, they're all gonna hate us.

54:58.887 --> 55:01.155
So? We'll be done.

55:01.156 --> 55:05.159
Yeah... Tony will be smashing Dina,
I'll be hooking up with Teresa,

55:05.160 --> 55:06.894
and Valerie, she'll be all yours.

55:09.798 --> 55:10.798
Youse are good.

55:10.799 --> 55:13.566
- Go get 'em.
- Watch this.

55:16.070 --> 55:18.072
What are you guys talking
about over there?

55:18.073 --> 55:21.041
Tony just wanted to find
out the square route of 37,

55:21.042 --> 55:23.644
so I figured I'd help
him out, you know?

55:23.645 --> 55:27.181
Oh, okay.

55:27.182 --> 55:31.218
- You must be good with numbers.
- Well...

55:31.219 --> 55:33.687
I know a perfect 10 when I see one.

55:33.688 --> 55:37.758
Ohh.... You're so sweet.

55:37.959 --> 55:41.429
I never got to tell you about
my ferret, Mr. Wiggles.

55:41.430 --> 55:44.098
Oh, yeah, I'm so interested.
Please, tell me.

55:44.099 --> 55:48.068
Well, every Christmas, I dress
him up in a ballerina costume.

55:48.069 --> 55:51.105
Wow. Jeez.

55:51.106 --> 55:52.606
What?

55:52.607 --> 55:57.912
Oh, nothing, I just wish I had a cigarette
when we talked about Mr. Wiggles.

55:57.913 --> 56:00.714
We could drive into town
to get a pack, if you want.

56:00.715 --> 56:02.983
Yeah, that's a great idea!

56:02.984 --> 56:06.520
Then we could smoke cigarettes and
talk about Mr. Wiggles all night!

56:06.521 --> 56:08.221
Let's go!

56:23.604 --> 56:25.673
Oh, you nasty little bitch.

56:25.674 --> 56:28.876
Oh... oh.

56:28.877 --> 56:31.545
Oh, fuck yeah.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.520
Aah!

56:50.131 --> 56:54.101
- I have a hamster named Buzzy that...
- Oh, wow, that's fucking amazing.

56:54.102 --> 56:56.636
He knows how to swim.

57:05.979 --> 57:08.248
Hey, what's up?

57:08.249 --> 57:11.785
Nothing, just, uh,
catching up on some emails.

57:11.786 --> 57:15.288
That's cool. So, uh...

57:15.289 --> 57:19.602
- you get good reception out here?
- Yeah, it's not too bad.

57:19.628 --> 57:22.229
- Oh, really?
- Yeah...

57:22.230 --> 57:24.732
So, um...

57:24.733 --> 57:27.201
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

57:27.202 --> 57:28.869
Nothing, I'm just
hanging out, you know?

57:28.870 --> 57:30.871
- It's all good, sweetheart.
- It's, uh...

57:30.872 --> 57:35.877
- You're gonna have fun, come on.
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.

57:36.578 --> 57:38.112
Just relax.

57:38.113 --> 57:40.147
- I'm pretty relaxed.
- Just relax.

57:40.148 --> 57:42.516
- What the fuck?!
- What the hell was that?

57:42.517 --> 57:45.719
What the fuck?! What, you
don't wanna be with <i> me?</i>

57:45.720 --> 57:47.988
No, why would you think
I'd wanna be with you?

57:47.989 --> 57:51.292
'Cause every other bitch in New
Jersey would kill to wife me up!

57:51.293 --> 57:52.760
Wife... really?

57:52.761 --> 57:56.564
'Cause if I was married to you, I'd put
poison in your orange juice every morning!

57:56.565 --> 58:01.069
Yeah, well, if I was married to
you, I'd drink it, you fuckin' bitch!

58:03.438 --> 58:05.104
Dick.

58:10.644 --> 58:15.149
So, uh, is Buzzy a boy
or a girl hamster?

58:17.385 --> 58:20.287
So how much longer to the store?

58:20.288 --> 58:24.124
Couldn't be much further.
Oh, my God, you see that?

58:24.325 --> 58:25.159
See what?

58:25.160 --> 58:27.695
Looked like a little puppy
dog... it crossed the road.

58:27.696 --> 58:31.065
- A puppy dog?
- Yeah, it looked like it was lost!

58:31.066 --> 58:33.367
Stop the car!

58:33.368 --> 58:37.371
I think it ran into the cow pasture! Oh,
God, I hope the cows don't eat him!

58:37.372 --> 58:39.340
Oh, my God!

58:43.712 --> 58:47.114
Freddy! Freddy, you asshole!

58:55.123 --> 58:58.258
<i>There's so many hot
gorilla juiceheads in here...</i>

58:58.259 --> 58:59.994
Hey, where's Rosemarie?

58:59.995 --> 59:04.164
Uh, she saw an all-night buffet and
decided to go back for a midnight snack.

59:06.767 --> 59:08.102
What?

59:08.103 --> 59:10.938
<i>Mmm. Where's my shot?</i>

59:10.939 --> 59:13.007
<i>- Hey, wingman!</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah!</i>

59:17.144 --> 59:18.812
Huh?

59:18.813 --> 59:20.147
Ah!

59:27.856 --> 59:31.825
- Vinnie, you fucking asshole!
- What?

59:31.826 --> 59:35.296
Fuck all of youse. I need a smoke.

59:37.732 --> 59:39.400
Yo, hey, come back here, you pussy!

59:39.401 --> 59:42.535
What'd you have, two bowls
of stupid this morning?

59:46.408 --> 59:47.941
Oh, that was a good one.

59:48.943 --> 59:51.679
- Yo, that was dope.
- Eww.

59:51.680 --> 59:52.785
Why do they keep flying into it

59:52.811 --> 59:55.449
when they see their friends
exploding all over the place?

59:55.450 --> 01:00:01.121
Just mindless life forms following the
light aimlessly into the darkness.

01:00:07.295 --> 01:00:08.827
Mm?

01:00:37.325 --> 01:00:38.926
Hey, anybody home in here?

01:00:50.904 --> 01:00:54.341
- Hey, where'd Freddy go?
- He had a hissy fit and took off.

01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:57.010
Oh, he's got my fucking keys!

01:00:57.011 --> 01:01:00.180
You just gonna leave
me here? Screw him.

01:01:00.181 --> 01:01:03.817
- Ah, quiet, bitch.
- Screw you.

01:01:03.818 --> 01:01:06.086
Hey, Freddy!

01:01:06.487 --> 01:01:10.124
- What's he doing?
- Dropping dead, I hope.

01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:13.460
Hey, I'm starving.
What do we got to eat?

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.929
I got some hot dogs in the fridge.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.632
Hot dogs? I'm all over that shit.

01:01:24.539 --> 01:01:30.209
Hey, Freddy, you fucking
dickhead! Where are you?

01:01:40.587 --> 01:01:42.657
Freddy?

01:01:43.358 --> 01:01:45.159
Where the fuck are you?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.293
Vinnie!

01:01:49.062 --> 01:01:52.330
If he's fucking with me, I'm
gonna throw him a beatin'.

01:01:56.436 --> 01:01:58.304
Freddy?

01:02:04.478 --> 01:02:08.115
So, yeah, I do, like, about
1,000 push-ups every day.

01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:10.150
Really?

01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:12.319
I need to eat <i> now.</i>

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.890
Good... get the barbecue going
while I get the other stuff ready.

01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:19.293
All right.

01:02:38.612 --> 01:02:40.547
Mm!

01:03:33.533 --> 01:03:36.637
No...

01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:08.861
Kill me.

01:05:11.999 --> 01:05:14.768
Please kill me.

01:05:23.644 --> 01:05:25.712
Did you hear that?

01:05:26.013 --> 01:05:27.080
Hear what?

01:05:27.081 --> 01:05:28.782
I thought I heard
something outside.

01:05:28.783 --> 01:05:31.452
It's probably just the
guys horsing around.

01:05:34.755 --> 01:05:37.257
There it is again.

01:05:37.258 --> 01:05:39.459
Why don't you see if they
want anything to eat?

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.295
Yeah, Val, I'm starving.

01:05:42.296 --> 01:05:46.566
All right. I'll be right back.

01:05:48.669 --> 01:05:50.237
Mmm.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.272
Told you I was hungry.

01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:08.355
Freddy?

01:06:08.856 --> 01:06:11.023
Vinnie.

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:14.893
Freddy?

01:06:15.629 --> 01:06:18.230
Stop horsing around.

01:06:19.533 --> 01:06:21.701
Vinnie?

01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:28.373
Freddy?

01:06:34.047 --> 01:06:36.215
Vinnie?

01:06:38.618 --> 01:06:40.452
Freddy!

01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:45.559
Hey, how many dogs am I
supposed to be making out there?

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.830
- We don't know yet.
- Where the hell is Valerie?

01:06:50.331 --> 01:06:53.266
So, Dina, whose house
is this anyway?

01:06:53.267 --> 01:06:56.403
- It's Teresa's Uncle Vito's house.
- And who's Uncle Vito?

01:06:56.404 --> 01:06:59.372
Vito Rubino.

01:06:59.573 --> 01:07:03.677
Teresa's uncle is Big "V" Rubino?

01:07:03.678 --> 01:07:06.114
- Isn't he in jail?
- He's under house arrest...

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:10.216
but I wouldn't bet on too many
witnesses testifying against him.

01:07:10.217 --> 01:07:14.588
That's it. I gotta go find where these
meatballs are. I'll be right back.

01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:16.490
Hurry up.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:27.834
Yo, Freddy, Vinnie! Teresa's
uncle is Big "V" Rubino.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.869
We gotta get the fuck outta here!

01:07:35.408 --> 01:07:38.277
Hey, you dickheads in there?

01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:43.849
What the fuck?

01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:04.538
I'm gonna go and straighten
things up around the pool.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.240
- You want a hand?
- No, I got it, um...

01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:11.309
could you clean things up around here and
see when everyone would like to eat?

01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:17.749
I bet they'll be
dying to eat by now.

01:08:45.212 --> 01:08:46.912
Shit!

01:09:31.591 --> 01:09:33.892
Bunch of pigs.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.395
Ugh.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.376
You guys want something to eat?

01:10:01.555 --> 01:10:03.790
Dina! Dina!

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:07.294
Dina!

01:10:07.295 --> 01:10:10.411
Joey and Joanne! They're dead.

01:10:10.437 --> 01:10:13.661
- So is Gigi!
- What about Candi and Gino?

01:10:13.662 --> 01:10:16.670
I don't know... I don't know. They
have to still be in their room.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.339
Oh, my God.

01:10:32.852 --> 01:10:36.488
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:10:43.396 --> 01:10:44.831
Wait...

01:10:49.268 --> 01:10:50.670
Gino!

01:10:57.244 --> 01:10:58.912
Dina!

01:10:58.913 --> 01:11:03.083
Dina, open the door! Dina, help me!

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:05.083
Tony!

01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:20.934
Help me.

01:11:21.969 --> 01:11:25.839
- Oh, my God, what's going on?
- I don't know... call 9-1-1.

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:31.411
Uncle Vito? Uncle Vito, pick up!

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.013
Yeah, somebody's trying to kill us!

01:11:39.786 --> 01:11:42.254
Quick, open the door!

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.994
Ohh!

01:11:47.995 --> 01:11:52.030
Dina, it's stuck! Oh, my God.

01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:57.003
- Run!
- Oh, my God.

01:11:59.173 --> 01:12:03.042
Come on... come on,
get up! Get up... run!

01:12:03.043 --> 01:12:05.210
Let's get out of here!

01:12:10.384 --> 01:12:12.452
Oh, my God!

01:12:16.657 --> 01:12:18.825
- Oh, God.
- Oh, holy shit.

01:12:18.826 --> 01:12:20.760
Oh, God.

01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:23.663
- Where are the fucking keys?
- Come on!

01:12:33.139 --> 01:12:35.175
Come on!

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:37.777
Let us in!

01:12:37.778 --> 01:12:41.379
It's locked! Come on!

01:12:41.981 --> 01:12:43.949
Come on.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:46.451
Ohh!

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:07.073
Shit!

01:13:07.074 --> 01:13:10.877
- Where's the fucking light switch?
- I don't know. I got it!

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.957
Go, go, go! Go!

01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:27.827
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.467
Come on, come on!

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:40.673
- Valerie!
- Valerie!

01:13:40.674 --> 01:13:42.607
My God!

01:13:56.624 --> 01:13:58.822
- Where the fuck can we go?
- We can't use the cars...

01:13:58.848 --> 01:14:01.283
- and he'll catch us in the woods.
- If we can get to the rowboat...

01:14:01.309 --> 01:14:03.133
we can take it to the middle of the
lake, where he can't reach us.

01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:06.716
You know I can't swim!
If I fall in, I'll drown!

01:14:06.767 --> 01:14:09.936
Jesus Christ, Teresa,
he's gonna kill us!

01:14:10.938 --> 01:14:14.105
Who are you?

01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:18.111
Edgar?

01:14:18.112 --> 01:14:20.680
Troy, my name is.

01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:24.150
- Why?!
- It's a Jersey thing.

01:14:25.553 --> 01:14:26.953
Dina, look out!

01:14:28.055 --> 01:14:30.189
Dina!

01:14:55.881 --> 01:14:57.984
Police!

01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:03.089
What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong!

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:04.958
Everybody's dead!

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.860
Everybody? Is there anybody else?

01:15:07.861 --> 01:15:10.296
- In the house.
- All right, stay here.

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.998
Backup and the ambulance
are on the way.

01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:15.034
Stay right here. Dennis, come on.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.285
I'm Officer Davis. Do you need
any kind of medical assistance?

01:15:32.286 --> 01:15:35.154
Okay. Go check inside!

01:15:35.155 --> 01:15:37.624
Okay, I need you to tell
me everything that happened.

01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:40.660
- I need to see Dina!
- No, no, no.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.495
You can't go in there. You
need to stay out here with me.

01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:51.604
I'll take care of this one. Check
the rest of the barn for me.

01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:52.939
Okay.

01:15:55.442 --> 01:15:59.246
He's got a pulse! Help
me get the gurney.

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:17.730
Help me!

01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:22.101
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

01:16:22.102 --> 01:16:24.671
- What the fuck happened?
- Man, I was nervous.

01:16:25.172 --> 01:16:28.841
<i>- Gordon to Davis.</i>
- Hold on.

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:31.935
- Davis, go.
<i>- How do I explain this?</i>

01:16:31.936 --> 01:16:34.247
<i>- I have an 11-71.</i>
- Shit.

01:16:34.248 --> 01:16:36.315
<i>I think you should get
over here right now.</i>

01:16:36.316 --> 01:16:39.152
I'm on my way. Okay...

01:16:39.153 --> 01:16:44.622
I need you to stay in this
spot, okay? I'll be right back.

01:16:47.927 --> 01:16:50.897
Plant this in his hands. We'll just
say it was self-defense, all right?

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:54.900
All right, cool. Good
looking out, man.

01:16:57.904 --> 01:17:02.273
Dex, look at this. How am
I supposed to say that?

01:17:05.812 --> 01:17:09.247
Some weird shit going on here, man.

01:17:58.898 --> 01:18:02.767
This can't be the guy.
Wasn't this guy missing an eye?

01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:17.115
Get over here right now.

01:18:33.499 --> 01:18:36.035
Take that, motherfucker!

01:19:05.998 --> 01:19:09.100
Come back here, you bitch!

01:19:13.072 --> 01:19:16.241
I'll gut ya like a pig!

01:19:28.421 --> 01:19:32.593
I'll turn your insides
into sausage!

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:52.076
<i>♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪</i>

01:20:12.432 --> 01:20:14.100
No!

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:17.470
No!

01:20:22.409 --> 01:20:24.110
Please!

01:20:26.446 --> 01:20:28.447
Please!

01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:32.684
Get over here right now.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.355
Please!

01:20:41.928 --> 01:20:44.762
Get over here right now.

01:20:49.969 --> 01:20:52.537
Uncle Vito!

01:21:03.416 --> 01:21:04.951
Uncle Vito!

01:21:07.787 --> 01:21:12.391
He was gonna kill me, just like
he killed Dina and everyone else.

01:21:12.392 --> 01:21:16.228
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- How did you get here so fast?

01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:18.797
When Edgar called, we
knew something was wrong.

01:21:18.798 --> 01:21:19.999
Edgar?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.093
Last week, two of my guys went missing
down here, and when you called,

01:21:23.119 --> 01:21:26.973
said you were coming down for the weekend,
I asked Edgar to keep an eye on you.

01:21:27.474 --> 01:21:30.409
He left me this message
an hour before you called.

01:21:31.063 --> 01:21:34.547
<i>Mr. V., my brother's lost
his fuckin' mind today.</i>

01:21:34.548 --> 01:21:37.616
<i>Turned our barn into a
fuckin' slaughterhouse.</i>

01:21:37.617 --> 01:21:40.019
<i>Give me the phone, you big idiot.</i>

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.320
<i>Troy, no!</i>

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.758
Oh, my God.

01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:51.097
Promise me I'll never have
to see this place again.

01:21:51.498 --> 01:21:54.333
- Please.
- I promise, Princess.

01:21:54.334 --> 01:21:58.103
Never again. Never again!

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:20.794
It's so beautiful out here, and
I love all this nature, but...

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.062
don't you miss your beach
house down by the shore?

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:26.699
What beach house? After the
storm, there was nothing left.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.236
So I took the insurance money,
and I bought all of this.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:33.072
No way. You own all of this?

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:36.317
- This must have cost you a fortune.
- A fortune?

01:22:36.343 --> 01:22:41.149
A fortune? The little mobster who used
to own it was so anxious to sell it,

01:22:41.175 --> 01:22:47.281
he practically gave it away. So I wound up
spending pennies to buy a fully renovated,

01:22:47.282 --> 01:22:50.899
cool-as-balls home with a lake!

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:54.126
Tell me I'm not the
luckiest guy in the world.

01:22:54.127 --> 01:22:56.761
That's why I like you, Ronnie.

01:22:58.664 --> 01:23:01.734
'Cause you're smart
<i>and</i> you're classy.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:08.739
Ohh... life is good.

01:23:22.588 --> 01:23:27.026
Oh, my God! That's a huge gun!

01:23:27.527 --> 01:23:31.028
And it's always fully loaded.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.462
Here, little puppy.

01:24:03.663 --> 01:24:07.366
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:24:07.567 --> 01:24:10.870
Come here, little puppy.
Don't let the cows eat you.
