09:35.366 --> 09:37.577
Hey! Section's closed.
The boss is busy.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.996
Pueblo, let the boy through.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.629
Hello, son. I haven't seen you
around here before.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.797
I just got into town.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.551
My name is Miguelâ€¦ Diaz.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.220
Well, then it's a pleasure
to meet you, Miguelito.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.393
Uh, my mother is Carmen Diaz.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.564
Your old lady sounds hot.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.859
She's from Ecuador.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.698
What is this?
Is something wrong with your head?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.827
-Pueblo, get this guy out of here.
-Come on.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.005
You gonna let him
beat you up, cousin?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.675
You're brave, Miguelin.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.303
You want a beer?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.596
I want answers.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.931
Carmen and Rosa Diaz.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.018
You knew when you lived in Guayaquil.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.898
Dude thinks he's the boss.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.234
Look, man.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.737
I'm not the guy you're looking for.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.450
And honestly, I've never known
a fucking Carmen.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.287
Now if you don't fuck off,

11:03.371 --> 11:07.083
all these guys you see here
are gonna beat the shit out of you.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.336
So go to fucking hell.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.089
Sorry, uhâ€¦

11:15.341 --> 11:18.344
Okay. I'm leaving, sir.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.762
Get up, damn Pueblo.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.263
You're being dramatic, man.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.266
Goddamn stupid idiot.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.958
Hector!
What are you doing? That's Rogelio's job.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.546
He's really tired. He just
had a baby. We have to give him a break.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
Sometimes you're too nice, Hector.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.246
Holy shit.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.096
My name is Miguel.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.974
And you? Your name?

24:57.412 --> 25:00.040
Hey, thank you so much.

25:00.123 --> 25:00.957
Really.

25:01.791 --> 25:05.212
What you did was just incredible.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.300
It was nothing.
I was here at the right time.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.302
Where's your accent from?

25:13.428 --> 25:14.846
I'm American.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.397
You saved my son.
You're a hero.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.274
How can I repay you?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.819
Please have dinner with us.
