It's a chance for them to be successful
in their rehabilitation.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.375
[ominous music playing]

11:38.375 --> 11:41.875
- Admirable work, Father.
- So true. And very pious as well.

11:42.708 --> 11:45.041
In the archives
of the Cathedral of Santiago,

11:45.041 --> 11:47.166
we recently discovered
documented references

11:47.166 --> 11:49.625
to an ancient church
located in this very same spot.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.291
And here we have references
to testimony from pilgrims

11:52.291 --> 11:54.375
that also appear
in this Benedictine codex.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.916
With all this Latin shit
and history, he'll be so overwhelmed,

11:56.916 --> 11:58.083
he won't have time to think.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.625
And also in this codex from the College
of Saint-Martin-des-Champs.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.958
And here where it says,
<i>"Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi</i>."

12:06.000 --> 12:08.166
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

12:08.166 --> 12:10.125
I'm afraid I don't understand.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.625
This codex is from the fifth century.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.708
But you see,
my church was built much later. In 1240.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.541
If our calculations are correct,
then the oldest church

12:18.541 --> 12:21.541
in Paris would no longer be
the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.000
But this church below.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.916
[Berlin] <i>And what happens
to a man of the cloth,</i>

12:26.916 --> 12:29.041
<i>who is so completely
in love with his church</i>

12:29.041 --> 12:32.958
when he learns that he has
a priceless treasure right under his feet?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.333
He gets horny like a bitch in heat.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.416
[laughs]

12:36.416 --> 12:39.541
[uplifting orchestral music continues]

12:44.416 --> 12:47.125
Maybe we can all go down
to the crypt together. Hmm?

12:47.125 --> 12:50.500
We can take a look around,
seeing as you are all here.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.708
[GPR beeps]

13:05.875 --> 13:07.458
[steady beeping]

13:13.625 --> 13:16.375
[beeping grows faster]

13:17.791 --> 13:18.750
[Keila] Wait.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.458
[rapid beeping]

13:22.041 --> 13:23.583
The GPR has detected a foundation.

13:24.791 --> 13:26.583
The GPR has one significant advantage.

13:26.583 --> 13:30.333
No matter how hard you look,
nobody understands a damn thing.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.166
About five meters below.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.125
And Father Toureaux will be there,
watching, looking for clues,

13:35.125 --> 13:36.541
trying to grasp what's happening.

13:36.541 --> 13:40.500
<i>And he will see that glimmer
in our eyes, that ripple of emotion.</i>

13:40.500 --> 13:43.250
And he will understand
that he is witnessing history.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.041
Definitely stonework.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.541
- This could be a Roman arch.
- [gasps]

13:48.541 --> 13:51.833
And just as his climax
of anticipation approaches...

13:51.833 --> 13:54.041
- [mimics explosion]
- [music stops]

13:54.041 --> 13:55.125
...we pop his balloon.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.041
I'm not sure.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.291
Uh, not sure about what?

13:59.291 --> 14:01.375
[Damián] Just because
the radar detected stonework

14:01.375 --> 14:03.166
doesn't mean we've discovered an edifice.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.833
We'll need to gather more evidence
before excavating.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.708
[Berlin] <i>Toureaux has to have
absolute faith and trust in us.</i>

14:08.708 --> 14:11.458
Because we can't set up
a fake archeological dig

14:11.458 --> 14:13.416
just because the priest is horny.

14:13.416 --> 14:15.875
For that, we'll need
something more tangible.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.708
[rhythmic music playing]

14:17.708 --> 14:21.083
And why do we wanna set up
a fake archeological dig in this crypt?

14:21.083 --> 14:22.416
'Cause...

14:22.916 --> 14:26.625
this crypt actually has a secret passage
to the catacombs of Paris.

14:26.625 --> 14:29.958
Twenty meters underground
runs 300 kilometers of tunnels

14:29.958 --> 14:32.208
<i>that gives us access to the entire city.</i>

14:34.416 --> 14:35.250
What we want...

14:36.291 --> 14:40.250
is to follow the tunnels all the way to...

14:43.250 --> 14:44.125
here.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.625
Forty-five meters from the crypt.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.875
Exactly where all the royal families

14:48.875 --> 14:51.000
of Europe will have deposited
their jewels.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.666
So that Uncle Berlin
can make a withdrawal.

14:53.666 --> 14:55.833
What's there? Some kind of bank vault?

14:56.333 --> 14:58.166
- A museum?
- [Berlin] No...

14:59.083 --> 15:02.625
The biggest and most prestigious
auction house in Paris.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.416
[Bruce] Mm.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.541
- We do have a problem, though.
- Oh.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.625
A problem?

15:07.625 --> 15:10.000
They're not deposited at the same time.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.375
In fact, they'll arrive little by little
from 34 different cities.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.583
[Bruce] I don't get it.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.958
How are we supposed to swipe them
all in one night?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.375
By learning the date of the last shipment.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.916
And that's why we are staying here,
in this hotel.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.666
Across the street lives Monsieur Polignac,
director of the auction house.

15:27.666 --> 15:30.750
He's the only one who knows
the exact time of deposit.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.250
[rhythmic music ends]

15:34.250 --> 15:35.833
[Cameron] A different hairstyle?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.416
- [Keila] It's fine.
- [Cameron] You sure?

15:37.416 --> 15:40.291
Yes. [coughs]

15:40.291 --> 15:42.416
Do we have to dress
like we're going to a wedding?

15:42.416 --> 15:43.750
Keila.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.333
Thieves have this ridiculous habit

15:45.333 --> 15:48.125
of either dressing like thieves
or dressing too casually.

15:48.125 --> 15:51.333
Like those people
who wear tracksuits when they travel.

15:51.333 --> 15:54.833
But, if you intend
to break into an apartment

15:54.833 --> 15:56.833
in a very chic part of Paris,

15:56.833 --> 15:58.916
then you better dress accordingly.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.250
Wouldn't you agree?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.750
[Damián] And with this fabulous cake,
who would ever think you were thieves? Hm?

16:11.625 --> 16:15.041
[whistling nonchalantly]

16:15.041 --> 16:17.625
[Cameron] You look fine Keila.
It's really pretty.

16:17.625 --> 16:20.000
- [Keila] I'm not sure...
- Listen, Roi.

16:21.166 --> 16:25.125
I want to advise you that, even in love,
there are lines that you cannot cross.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.916
I happened to notice
that you've been making eyes at Cameron.

16:30.916 --> 16:33.208
No. I walked away.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.708
In actual fact,
she was the one looking at me.

16:35.708 --> 16:39.833
She looks at you, you walk away.
You've understood things perfectly Roi.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.666
Hmm.

16:41.666 --> 16:44.750
[sighs] That young lady
has a troubled past,

16:44.750 --> 16:47.625
but I'm afraid
this is not the time to get into that.

16:47.625 --> 16:51.541
All I can say for the moment is that
she's been in a mental institution.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.250
Considering I am not
father figure material,

16:55.958 --> 16:57.083
I'm asking <i>you</i>.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.041
I want you to keep an eye on her.

16:59.541 --> 17:01.250
On <i>her</i>, not her tattoos.

17:01.250 --> 17:05.458
[through gritted teeth] And I must insist
your relationship stays platonic.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.625
[gently] Have I made myself clear, Roi?

17:08.625 --> 17:11.458
[tense music pulsing]

17:11.458 --> 17:12.416
Yes, sir.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.333
[softly] That's settled, then.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.041
[Damián] Ready, everyone.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.666
All right. They've just left the house.
Time to move.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.458
[Damián on radio] <i>Bruce, follow them
in case they double back.</i>

17:36.291 --> 17:39.625
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Damián] <i>Relax. You look way too stiff.</i>

17:39.625 --> 17:42.750
You're on the way
to a friend's party, not to a funeral.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.708
You're too close to me.
I can't reach the lock.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.250
I have to. People are watching us.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.458
[lock rattling]

18:08.125 --> 18:09.375
[quietly] I can't do it.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.875
[grunts]

18:10.875 --> 18:14.000
I'm trying to get a small key
into a really small hole.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.666
What the fuck you doing?

18:17.666 --> 18:19.291
Can you get it in now?

18:28.250 --> 18:29.958
- [lock clicks open]
- Door's open.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.250
Keila, your turn. Go.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.291
[both speaking French]

18:40.500 --> 18:42.583
- Bonjour.
- [Keila] Bonjour.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.458
Roi, check the stairs.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.666
[Roi] There are three locks in the door.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.666
[high-pitched beep]

19:14.333 --> 19:15.375
[drill whirs]

19:26.166 --> 19:28.250
Careful. Neighbor in the building.

19:29.708 --> 19:31.333
[elevator clangs]

19:31.333 --> 19:32.875
- Hurry up.
- [Keila] Here.

19:33.416 --> 19:34.875
[drill whirs]

19:38.125 --> 19:39.708
- Ready.
- [lock clicks open]

19:39.708 --> 19:40.791

- Two down.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.416

20:13.916 --> 20:15.916
[tablet humming]

20:16.791 --> 20:17.625
[chimes]

20:20.500 --> 20:21.958
- [chimes]
- Six, five, seven, eight.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.583
- [lock clicks]
- We're in.

20:25.541 --> 20:26.833

21:05.500 --> 21:06.875
[Damián] Got it.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.708
[Cameron] <i>And now? Can you see me?</i>

21:10.708 --> 21:11.625
Got you.

21:11.625 --> 21:12.708
Okay.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.250
[drill whirring]

22:03.583 --> 22:05.083
Time to go.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.708
Shit! Someone's coming.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.791
[quietly] There.

22:18.333 --> 22:19.375
Keila, the alarm.

Let's go find Quentin.

Quentin?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.166
Quentin! Where are you?

Quentin?

22:49.750 --> 22:51.541
- [whimpers]
- [dog walker] Quentin.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.083
Quentin!

22:55.750 --> 22:56.708
Shh.

- Quentin!

[dog walker] Here you are. Hey, naughty.

23:15.666 --> 23:17.375
Do you wanna play?

23:17.958 --> 23:19.041
Come on.

Let's go. Milo.

Come here. Come on. We gotta go.

[upbeat, funky music playing]

24:30.208 --> 24:31.833
[Berlin] Okay. He's left the building.

24:31.833 --> 24:32.958
You can go now.

[elevator bell dings]

I'd rather stay here. Thanks.

24:49.291 --> 24:51.375

24:51.375 --> 24:53.500
I wanted to talk earlier,
but they were listening.

24:53.500 --> 24:57.208
Anyway, when I was picking that lock
and you grabbed my ass,

24:57.208 --> 24:58.708
in my opinion, you crossed the line.

24:58.708 --> 25:03.125
And please, don't take this personally,
but I'd prefer to keep our relationship

25:03.791 --> 25:04.666
professional.

25:04.666 --> 25:05.916
It <i>was</i> professional.

25:05.916 --> 25:07.541
I was helping you open the door.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.083
But no worries, I understand.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.250
Au revoir.

25:11.791 --> 25:15.083
Well, I also caught you watching me
while I was getting dressed.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.333
That was kinda weird.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.250
- Hmm?
- Nothing personal.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.041
I was just stimulating my imagination.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.583
When I wake up alone at night,

25:23.250 --> 25:24.333
I masturbate.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.333
It really helps me get to sleep.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.500
There are pills for that, you know?

25:29.500 --> 25:30.666
Oh yeah?

25:30.666 --> 25:32.333
For the insomnia, of course.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.000
Yeah. Of course, my insomnia.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.500
Any other ideas?

25:36.500 --> 25:38.750
I don't want there to be any confusion.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.125
Confusion about what?

25:42.208 --> 25:45.208
Our relationship.
About what happened today.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.333
Imaginary, professional, or otherwise.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.333
Got it.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.583
Would you like to know
about my first relationship?

25:51.583 --> 25:52.875
It was my only one.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.666
And since then, all that interests me

25:54.666 --> 25:57.333
when I'm with a guy
is his expiration date.

25:57.333 --> 26:01.583
Here, in capital letters. October 25th.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.791
So don't worry, Roi.
There's no risk of any confusion. [laughs]

26:04.791 --> 26:05.916
We're all clear, then.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.041
Crystal clear.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.625
Off you go. Time for your warm milk.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.208
You look so cute
in those glasses, Harry Potter.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.208
[chuckles] These are fake lenses.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.041
I wear them because they're cool.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.750
- They're a gift from Berlin.
- Ah, Berlin.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.208
We've been friends for a long time.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.958
- I'm what you would call his lieutenant.
- And do you always do what you're told?

26:27.958 --> 26:30.625
I suppose he told you
to come see me tonight.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.458
Very obedient, aren't you?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.875
Yes, he asked me to come here.

26:33.875 --> 26:36.208
In fact, he ordered me to babysit you.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.916
From what I hear,
it appears you have a screw loose.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.875
[chuckles softly]

26:42.458 --> 26:45.208
So I would suggest that you behave.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.291
Or no warm milk for you.

I've been with my wife for 24 years.

I had two bad affairs.

- Finding the love of your life takes time.
- No, Damián. I have to stop you there.

28:06.458 --> 28:09.125
The love of your life is a fairy tale!

28:09.875 --> 28:14.625
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
but... love just fades away.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.625
The only thing
worthwhile is the beginning.

28:17.625 --> 28:19.708
That's the best part about love.

When every song
you hear reminds you of her.

and all you do is talk.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.250
Mm-mm. No, no, no.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.291
Love is precisely
what comes after all that.

28:34.291 --> 28:35.666

28:36.166 --> 28:38.291
Then, during dinner,
you're happy to be quiet

28:38.291 --> 28:39.833

28:39.833 --> 28:42.166
To love someone,
you must really know them.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.583
How can you love someone you don't know?

28:44.583 --> 28:46.916
I guess I didn't know her that well, then.

- Hm.

28:48.583 --> 28:51.375

even if my third marriage fell to pieces,

39:12.458 --> 39:15.791
So, I was wondering.
I know this might seem crazy.

39:15.791 --> 39:18.958
But by any chance is the wonderful woman
you mentioned Polignac's wife?

39:18.958 --> 39:20.041
You're absolutely right.

39:20.041 --> 39:22.000
But what does that
got to do with anything?

39:23.208 --> 39:27.250
Together, we've just created
a beautiful fake archeological dig.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.791
And we're going to fill
this guy's basement with wooden beams,

39:29.791 --> 39:32.000
massive jackhammers, and hydraulics.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.791
And you want me to have a fuckin' coffee

39:33.791 --> 39:36.375
with the wife
of the man we're going to rob?

39:39.916 --> 39:40.791
You're right.

39:40.791 --> 39:45.250
I wanted so badly to meet someone
that I forgot about the plan.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.500
And I put everyone in danger.

39:47.500 --> 39:51.291
Andrés, listen. You know there
are billions of women on planet earth.

39:51.291 --> 39:52.750
Don't go and complicate things

39:52.750 --> 39:54.916
with the wife
of the man we're going to rob.

39:54.916 --> 39:55.875
[Keila] Psst!

39:55.875 --> 39:57.291
The priest is back.

39:57.291 --> 39:58.791
[tense music playing]

40:00.208 --> 40:02.166
[detector crackles, whirring]

40:02.166 --> 40:03.916
Professor, I found something.

40:04.791 --> 40:06.000
The signal's really strong.

40:12.541 --> 40:14.041
It looks like bronze.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.125
It's a chalice.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.791
That looks Byzantine to me.
Don't you think?

40:42.083 --> 40:44.750
[Berlin] Father, we'll need
more time for the excavation.

40:44.750 --> 40:48.000
I'd say about... three weeks. And equipment.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.791
I'll apply immediately
for parking authorization for the trucks.

40:51.791 --> 40:53.875
[whimsical music playing]

41:00.333 --> 41:02.166
[music fades]

41:03.125 --> 41:04.833
Can you tell me what we're doing here?

41:07.583 --> 41:11.458
Roi, have you ever... encountered someone
in the subway or the train,

41:11.458 --> 41:13.791
and you feel compelled
to know more about them?

41:13.791 --> 41:14.750
Definitely.

41:14.750 --> 41:17.291
Well, that's exactly
what happened to me last night.

41:17.291 --> 41:18.208
In that bar.

41:18.208 --> 41:20.125
So I'm waiting here,
hoping she'll come back

41:20.125 --> 41:21.250
so I can speak with her.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.500
Just two minutes.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.541
Two brief minutes.

41:23.541 --> 41:26.500
[chuckles] What use is two minutes?
You need an hour.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.291
Have coffee, get to know her.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.583
Two minutes. That's exactly what I need.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.750
When you're fascinated
by a woman, pfft, you become obsessed.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.458
And when you're obsessed, you're screwed.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.125
You become vulnerable.

41:38.125 --> 41:40.625
You become just another one
of those creepy morons

41:40.625 --> 41:41.875
who hit on her every night.

41:41.875 --> 41:45.208
Trying to make her laugh,
begging her for a date.

41:45.208 --> 41:47.958
- And I am not going to be one of them.
- So what are you gonna do?

41:47.958 --> 41:49.208
You follow military tactics.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.500
Scout the area, advance, and strike.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.875
Then, retreat.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.333
You get close to her,
have some small talk,

41:56.333 --> 41:58.083
and then you withdraw.

41:58.916 --> 42:02.375
I want her to be suitably impressed
and to appreciate the fact

42:02.375 --> 42:06.166
that I'm the first man
who <i>hasn't</i> tried to make love to her.

42:06.166 --> 42:07.958
- [both chuckle]
- Not a bad tactic.

42:09.166 --> 42:11.041
[whispering] Oh! Speak of the devil.

42:21.625 --> 42:23.458
[gasps] Roi, you come in

42:23.458 --> 42:26.000
and greet me like a friend
who hasn't seen me in a long time.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.791
Two minutes, okay? Two minutes, that's it.

42:28.791 --> 42:29.833
Shit! The book. Quick.

42:29.833 --> 42:32.166
This is gonna be perfect.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.375
[chuckles]

42:37.083 --> 42:38.625
[Camille, in French] Thank you, Bastian.

42:38.625 --> 42:41.333
[Bastian] Would you like
a croissant and orange juice?

42:41.333 --> 42:42.958
- Yes, please.
- You got it.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.166
Thank you.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.333
- Good morning.
- [Berlin] Morning.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.625
- [Bastian] What would you like?
- Café au lait, please.

42:52.625 --> 42:53.833
- [Bastian] Okay.
- Thanks.

42:53.833 --> 42:56.666
[instrumental music playing on stereo]

43:01.541 --> 43:04.416
Excuse me. Uh, are you Camille?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.625
Yes. Have we met?

43:06.625 --> 43:08.625
No. No, no. [chuckles] No.

43:08.625 --> 43:11.250
- <i>Merci.</i>
- I'm in Paris on vacation.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.958
Uh, my name is Simón.

43:12.958 --> 43:17.666
Uh, last night I had the pleasure
of hearing you sing.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.958
Ooh. I was impressed.

43:19.958 --> 43:21.583
[both chuckle]

43:21.583 --> 43:23.208
- [in English] I speak English.
- Oh.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.041
- It's my first language.
- [chuckles]

43:25.666 --> 43:26.500
Camila.

43:27.458 --> 43:29.291
Well, here in Paris, they call me Camille.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.416
- I've been here for eight years now.
- Ah.

43:32.416 --> 43:34.791
- Ah.
- Thank you for what you said earlier.

43:34.791 --> 43:36.708
Mm. I'm not much of a singer, though.

43:36.708 --> 43:39.625
[both chuckle]

43:41.500 --> 43:43.000
ABOUT PARADISE, CHARLES DUPOND

43:43.000 --> 43:44.125
Are you reading Dupond?

43:45.791 --> 43:47.208
Don't tell me you like Dupond.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.500
- Merci.
- He takes himself too seriously. [laughs]

43:50.500 --> 43:52.958
- You mean he's tedious.
- [both laugh]

43:52.958 --> 43:54.208
- True.
- I know.

43:54.875 --> 43:58.083
I keep trying to finish it,
but if I'm lucky maybe I'll lose it.

44:01.416 --> 44:02.916
Last night, you should've said hello.

44:02.916 --> 44:04.916
No, no. I didn't wanna bother you.

44:05.541 --> 44:08.041
Uh... last night, I was sitting there.

44:08.041 --> 44:10.291
I was thinking to myself
and wondering about,

44:10.291 --> 44:12.083
"What kind of music is on her playlist?"

44:12.083 --> 44:15.000
And I came up with 20,
maybe 30 songs I think you'd like.

44:15.833 --> 44:19.541
I'm not a fan of Spotify.
Me... [sighs] I prefer vinyl.

44:20.375 --> 44:22.666
So, let's see if you guess correctly.

44:23.166 --> 44:25.208
Okay. I'll give you two artists.

44:26.208 --> 44:30.291
And if I guess correctly, you have
to take me somewhere... extraordinary.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.125
Under V...

44:35.708 --> 44:37.166
Vanessa Paradis

44:38.375 --> 44:39.875
And Vinicius de Moraes.

44:39.875 --> 44:42.375
- [gasps] Wow! I'm impressed.
- Ah.

44:42.375 --> 44:43.583
[both laugh]

44:44.083 --> 44:46.458
And you don't have to worry
about our little bet.

44:46.458 --> 44:49.833
You see, I'm actually here to meet
a friend I haven't seen in a long time.

44:49.833 --> 44:52.208
Wow! Speak of the devil.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.583
[exhales, chuckles]

44:56.125 --> 44:57.375
[laughs]

44:57.375 --> 45:00.625
[Berlin] Long time no see.
How've you been?

45:00.625 --> 45:03.041
- It's so good to see you.
- Yeah. Mm.

45:03.958 --> 45:05.791
- How are you?
- Uh, fine. Thanks.

45:05.791 --> 45:07.041
Um... [laughs]

45:07.666 --> 45:08.791
It was nice to meet you.

45:08.791 --> 45:11.750
I hope I have another opportunity
to come see you sing again.

45:11.750 --> 45:12.833
- Hm.
- Hopefully.

45:12.833 --> 45:13.791
<i>Enchantée.</i>

45:13.791 --> 45:15.666
- <i>Enchanté.</i>
- Well, enjoy Paris.

45:15.666 --> 45:17.500
Thank you. <i>J'adore Paris.</i>

45:17.500 --> 45:18.958
- Mm.
- Au revoir.

45:18.958 --> 45:19.875
Au revoir.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.375
- Bye.
<i>- </i>  Au revoir.

45:21.375 --> 45:24.250
[quietly] Slowly. Not too fast.
Nice and easy.

45:24.250 --> 45:26.291
We're gonna take a seat over here.

45:27.500 --> 45:33.125
Right next to the exit,
and we observe as Cupid does his magic.

45:33.125 --> 45:34.500
[both chuckle]

45:35.791 --> 45:38.333
- And how will we know it's working?
- It'll be something discreet.

45:38.333 --> 45:41.083
Maybe she'll look at us
or smile on her way out.

45:41.666 --> 45:42.958
I'll know my tactics worked.

45:42.958 --> 45:45.208
- [chuckles]
- Hey kid! Stop staring.

45:46.916 --> 45:48.125
Tell me something quick.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.416
How's your grandmother?

45:49.416 --> 45:50.500
My granny?

45:50.500 --> 45:51.583
Here she comes. C'mon.

45:51.583 --> 45:54.000
- Start talking. Anything.
- Um... Yeah. Gran. Yeah.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.333
- She's on her own.
- I see. Yeah.

45:55.333 --> 45:58.458
Uh, we try to go visit her,
but it's not easy, you know?

46:02.041 --> 46:03.583
[bell chimes]

46:06.000 --> 46:07.166
[quietly] What the fuck?

46:07.833 --> 46:08.833
What happened?

46:09.791 --> 46:11.291
She didn't even look at me.

46:12.250 --> 46:17.791
Maybe. I mean, you probably noticed,
but that lady is Polignac's wife.

46:17.791 --> 46:18.916
She's married.

46:18.916 --> 46:20.000
So, maybe that...

46:20.000 --> 46:21.458
No. No!

46:22.125 --> 46:23.791
Maybe I played too hard to get.

46:23.791 --> 46:27.416
Or I didn't fall head over heels
for her like all the other men.

46:28.041 --> 46:31.333
Maybe she misunderstood
and she thinks that I'm gay or something.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.958
I mean, she saw you come through the door.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.291
The way you looked at me,
it was like you'd seen Madonna.

46:37.291 --> 46:40.125
You said we were best friends
and that we hadn't seen each other, so...

46:40.125 --> 46:42.416
And what's with the three kisses?
What were you doing?

46:42.416 --> 46:45.125
- That's how they do it in France.
- And are any of us French?

46:45.125 --> 46:46.541
You know, it's kinda fucking weird

46:46.541 --> 46:48.958
that two straight men
start kissing each other!

46:50.041 --> 46:52.500
- Yeah.
- We've planted plutonium.

46:53.208 --> 46:55.291
We've just destroyed this relationship.

46:55.291 --> 46:58.125
[in French] Sir, you left your book
at the bar.

46:58.125 --> 46:59.041
[Berlin] Hmm.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.791
[in English] And now she thinks
I like Dupond.

47:04.708 --> 47:07.166
[loud whirring]

47:08.166 --> 47:09.458
[tense music playing]

47:13.166 --> 47:15.458
Cameron, start putting down
the glow sticks.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.250
Some people have never made it outta here.

47:22.375 --> 47:24.041
[device beeping]

47:30.791 --> 47:34.583
REMAINS FROM THE HOLY INNOCENTS' CEMETERY
DEPOSITED IN APRIL 1786

47:36.083 --> 47:38.166
[tense music swells]

47:45.916 --> 47:47.041
[Damián] This way.

48:06.125 --> 48:06.958
That way?

48:08.041 --> 48:09.083
[Damián] No.

48:11.083 --> 48:12.125
That way.

48:13.833 --> 48:15.250
[tense music continues]

48:40.916 --> 48:45.125
It is... exactly... here.

48:45.750 --> 48:48.958
We will dig a 14-meter tunnel
at a 27-degree angle.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.125
This'll give us direct access
to the retaining wall

48:51.125 --> 48:52.916
in the basement of the auction house.

48:52.916 --> 48:55.750
[energetic rock music playing]

49:00.208 --> 49:03.166
You have to drill
exactly where the laser's pointing.

49:03.666 --> 49:06.166
[machinery whirring]

49:08.500 --> 49:10.375
[rock music fades]

49:12.166 --> 49:14.416
- [line ringing]
- [man] <i>Yeah?</i>

49:14.416 --> 49:16.500
[Camille] <i>Darling, I'm running late.</i>

49:16.500 --> 49:19.041
Can you grab my clothes
and bring them down, please?

49:19.541 --> 49:21.000
We're late for the concert.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.208
[Polignac] <i>What concert?</i>

49:23.333 --> 49:25.958
[Camille] <i>The Ópera.
We talked about it a few days ago.</i>

49:25.958 --> 49:27.250
[Polignac] <i>Camille, I'm sorry.</i>

49:27.250 --> 49:30.625
<i>I forgot all about it. I've got a dinner
at the Italian embassy in 30 minutes.</i>

49:30.625 --> 49:33.250
I told you it was important to me.
My friends are performing.

49:35.250 --> 49:37.500
Game on! They're having an argument.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.833
He forgot about the opera.
She's pretty pissed.

49:40.541 --> 49:42.583
[Camille] <i>I never ask you for anything.</i>

49:42.583 --> 49:44.041
It's always what <i>you</i> want.

49:44.041 --> 49:47.125
<i>C'mon, Camille.
I can't change this at the last moment.</i>

49:47.875 --> 49:49.708
You should've reminded me this morning.

49:49.708 --> 49:51.000
[sighs] So that's it?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.750
What? You don't care
what's important to me?

49:53.625 --> 49:56.416
Just forget it. I'll go on my own. [sighs]

49:57.416 --> 50:00.291
This guy forgets
what's important to her? You, mm... idiot.

50:02.041 --> 50:02.958
[Roi chuckles]

50:02.958 --> 50:04.625
[energetic music playing]

50:04.625 --> 50:06.583
Find my tux. I need my tuxedo!

50:06.583 --> 50:07.791
Wait. Where are you going?

50:07.791 --> 50:09.125
To the opera!

50:10.875 --> 50:13.208
Go downstairs and polish my shoes.

50:13.208 --> 50:14.375
Hurry.

50:16.250 --> 50:18.250
[engine running]

50:34.291 --> 50:35.375
[music fades]

50:35.375 --> 50:37.166
[Toureaux] Professor Vázquez?

50:38.291 --> 50:39.708
Over here, Father.

50:40.833 --> 50:42.333
God bless the work of your hands.

50:42.333 --> 50:45.083
I've brought you some food
and some refreshments. [laughs]

50:45.083 --> 50:46.875
Father, there was no need for that.

50:46.875 --> 50:48.250
My pleasure.

50:48.250 --> 50:50.541
In fact, I have a small favor to ask you.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.625
Would you mind if I borrow the chalice?

50:55.208 --> 50:56.791
[Damián] Um... the chalice?

50:57.375 --> 50:58.208
What for?

50:58.208 --> 51:00.666
Well, you see,
I'm taking a small trip back to Spain,

51:00.666 --> 51:03.375
and I was looking forward
to visiting your alma mater.

51:03.375 --> 51:07.000
[laughs] And presenting the dean
with the chalice.
