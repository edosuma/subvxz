03:12.819 --> 03:14.445
- Who is it?
- Room service.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.199
Is it eggs?

03:18.658 --> 03:20.618
I don't know, sir. I didn't order it.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.638
You want some water with that?

03:40.722 --> 03:42.140
No, no. No, I don't.

03:42.849 --> 03:44.267
Looks like you had a night.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.190
They look perfect.

03:51.649 --> 03:52.734
Get out.

03:57.572 --> 04:01.242
I intended to bring that
to the attention of a member of staff.

04:02.744 --> 04:04.996
I had some difficulty getting it to open.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.333
It's the little key on the door key, sir.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.585
Right.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.009
I was looking for some nuts.

04:23.348 --> 04:24.807
I tend to avoid alcohol.

04:29.354 --> 04:30.480
When I can.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.076
I don't speak Spanish.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.187
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.

05:48.725 --> 05:50.268
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.437
I said the Pirates, not the Yankees.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.355
It's going to be Roberto's
year, I'm telling you.

05:54.439 --> 05:56.024
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.525
End of the room.

05:58.109 --> 06:00.153
No, no, the Pirates.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.404
You guys are going to be all over.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.406
It's Roberto Clemente, man.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.616
And by the way, I want to talk about...

06:12.957 --> 06:14.292
Not now!

06:15.960 --> 06:18.046
He's having the Friday crisis.

06:21.716 --> 06:23.301
- You Kemp?
- Yeah.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.845
He was expecting you yesterday.

06:26.137 --> 06:27.221
We had some weather.

06:27.305 --> 06:28.556
Yeah, I heard.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.308
Big snow in New York.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.811
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?

06:33.895 --> 06:35.021
No, thanks.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.647
What's all the fuss out front?

06:36.731 --> 06:37.982
You came in the front?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.318
We don't use that door.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.695
<i>Not when losjibaros pitch up.</i>

06:43.154 --> 06:44.238
What do they want?

06:44.322 --> 06:45.323
I don't know.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.825
Some fucked idea of a living wage.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.787
They've been out there
on and off for months.

06:51.996 --> 06:53.915
By the way, my name's Sala.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.875
Bob Sala, staff photographer.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.168
Pleased to meet you, Bob.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.377
Yeah.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.588
He's off.

07:01.339 --> 07:04.008
You might want to try
another subservient knock.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.510
Yeah.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.721
Kemp.

07:09.055 --> 07:10.723
Don't notice the wig.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.396
Yeah. What?

07:28.699 --> 07:31.410
If you're
who I think you are, you better sit down.

07:42.839 --> 07:44.799
You find it a little bright in here?

07:46.217 --> 07:48.177
I'd take them off,
but I have a medical condition.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.887
What do you mean, you're blind?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.056
Conjunctivitis, sir.

07:53.808 --> 07:54.934
The old red eye, huh?

07:59.772 --> 08:02.692
You arrive at a very,
very trying time, Mr. Kemp.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.986
One of those days stacking up.

08:05.069 --> 08:08.698
So, why don't we cut through the niceties
and just get right to it, huh?

08:09.073 --> 08:10.491
That's how I like to proceed.

08:10.575 --> 08:12.243
Okay. Your resume here.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.416
Very impressive CV.

08:19.709 --> 08:20.793
Yeah.

08:20.877 --> 08:23.254
You worked your way up
some interesting titles.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.341
I really like the "fluent Spanish."

08:27.425 --> 08:28.759
Wow.

08:31.470 --> 08:35.224
This CV is a bunch of bullshit.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.602
IS it?

08:38.311 --> 08:39.854
This is two days on the wire.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.523
A day dead. We don't have it.

08:46.903 --> 08:48.905
What is the matter with Moburg?

08:49.572 --> 08:52.366
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.

09:01.334 --> 09:05.338
You see, the problem with
this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

09:05.421 --> 09:08.174
is that I am among many
who don't enjoy reading it.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.551
We have an ailing circulation,

09:10.635 --> 09:13.888
and I just have to look around
this building to understand why.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.683
Lack of commitment
and too much self-indulgence.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.438
So what I'm looking for

09:22.521 --> 09:24.607
is some enthusiasm, some energy,

09:25.650 --> 09:27.026
some fresh blood.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.072
And the question that I'm asking myself

09:31.155 --> 09:33.366
is how much alcohol is usual in yours.

09:33.824 --> 09:34.825
My fresh blood?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.285
How much do you drink?

09:36.827 --> 09:39.288
I suppose at the upper end of "social."

09:39.497 --> 09:41.207
I'm poised to give up.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.710
Well, Puerto Rico may not be
the best place on Earth to do that.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.716
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.178
I wouldn't have paid for your hotel
if I hadn't already hired you.

09:54.262 --> 09:56.305
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon,

09:56.389 --> 09:58.099
and I do not need another heavy drinker.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.602
Which I perceive, from the condition
of eyeballs behind glasses,

10:01.686 --> 10:03.312
that you might very well qualify as.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.898
This is a medical condition, Mr. Lotterman.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.692
I know it might look
like something else, but this is a...

10:07.775 --> 10:08.859
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.

10:08.943 --> 10:10.194
Does it?

10:17.618 --> 10:18.703
Come here.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.208
That's the kind of
commitment I like to see in a man.

10:25.501 --> 10:28.713
Determination,
balanced with appropriate humanity.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.631
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:33.426 --> 10:35.177
Which side do you dress, Kemp?

10:35.636 --> 10:36.679
I beg your pardon?

10:37.054 --> 10:38.180
Politics.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.474
I kind of hang in the middle.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.564
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.859
They got two languages,
two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.319
We bring them stuff they never had.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.820
They either hate it or
they want more of it.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.322
It's a reluctant part of America.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.449
It's like an England with tropical fruit.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.825
Bob.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.201
Just the man I wanted to see.

10:59.285 --> 11:01.329
This is Paul Kemp.
He's joining us from New York.

11:01.412 --> 11:02.663
Yeah, yeah, we already met.

11:02.747 --> 11:05.499
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.126
And this is Mr. Hubert, accounting.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.502
Listen, do me a favor, will you?

11:08.586 --> 11:10.004
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.422
Introduce him to some of the guys.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.673
I'll take him up to Al's.

11:12.757 --> 11:13.799
The hell you will.

11:13.883 --> 11:14.925
You take him to the library.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.135
You pull out some volumes.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.470
I want him to get a sense of the paper.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.597
You know,
make some notes, go back a few years,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.515
paying particular attention
to bowling alleys.

11:21.599 --> 11:22.767
There's bowling and bowling alleys.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.268
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.

11:24.352 --> 11:25.519
A new one premieres every week.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.021
- Been to Puerto Rico before?
- No.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.481
You're going to fall right into it.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.566
There's a boom on here, Kemp.
It's an open door.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.860
You play it right, you can surf the place.

11:35.488 --> 11:36.822
What do you know about horoscopes?

11:36.906 --> 11:37.907
Nothing.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.367
Well, if I can write one, you can.

11:39.450 --> 11:42.536
So it's every day with a
special "Star's Star"

11:42.620 --> 11:44.372
featured Saturday with Betty Grable

11:44.455 --> 11:46.332
and Neil Sedaka, things like that.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.126
So here, everything you
need is right there.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.338
It's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."

11:52.463 --> 11:53.464
What happened to Madam La Zonga?

11:53.547 --> 11:54.548
He got canceled.

11:55.341 --> 11:56.425
What do you mean, fired?

11:56.634 --> 11:57.802
They raped him to death.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.596
They raped him to death?

12:00.805 --> 12:02.890
There are very few places on this island

12:02.973 --> 12:04.350
I decline to visit,

12:04.433 --> 12:05.935
but the toilets frequented by sailors

12:06.018 --> 12:08.813
on the west side of Candado Pier is one.

12:09.814 --> 12:11.148
They raped him to death?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.484
La Zonga died in a cubicle.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.321
Say, you're not artistic, are you, Kemp?

12:17.822 --> 12:18.906
Oh, no.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.492
You might want to
rethink those menthol cigarettes.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.994
They don't do a thing for you.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.223
Come by the house.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.391
I will

12:48.102 --> 12:49.186
I like your stuff.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.022
The cuttings you sent to Lotterman.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.024
It's good writing.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.359
Thanks.

12:58.863 --> 12:59.947
We'll talk.

13:02.783 --> 13:03.993
One more floor!

13:05.244 --> 13:08.622
They put in automated
packing machines about six months ago.

13:08.706 --> 13:10.791
They mechanized almost everything.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.627
There used to be 50 guys down here.
Now there's five.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.379
Hence happiness in the street.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.757
Souvenir, day one.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.095
Here's to pretty women
with filthy thoughts.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.183
- Want a burger?
- No.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.684
- Burger?
- No, thanks.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.352
<i>Try it. Dos.</i>

13:31.937 --> 13:33.397
So how was the induction?

13:33.564 --> 13:34.815
Somewhat fraught.

13:34.899 --> 13:38.486
No disrespect, Paul,
but he didn't have a lot of choice.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.905
You know how many people
applied for the job?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.406
One. You.

13:42.615 --> 13:43.657
Is that right?

13:43.908 --> 13:45.868
Even then, I thought I'd blown it.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.328
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.829
Which is what?

13:48.913 --> 13:51.916
Two and a half unpublished novels
and references of equal fiction.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.417
You're a novelist.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.794
In a manner of speaking.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.546
Can't even get read.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.007
So I figured I'd do some words for money,

14:00.090 --> 14:01.425
see how it's looking in a year or two.

14:01.509 --> 14:02.801
<i>At El Star?</i>

14:03.219 --> 14:04.762
Hate to tell you this on the way in,

14:04.845 --> 14:07.306
but this publication's on its way out.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.767
And as far as I'm concerned,
it can't come soon enough.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.352
Not going to happen...

14:11.435 --> 14:13.437
You like a little vonga on that?

14:13.521 --> 14:16.190
I'll give you 13 to 2 this
thing's over by June.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.316
They're going to cut the cord.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.984
Then why put in all the new machinery?

14:19.193 --> 14:21.695
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.406
Well, like I'm tired of
arguing the obvious.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.908
Come on. Let's eat.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.744
Now, I got to go
and see a man about a horse.

14:29.954 --> 14:31.789
Good to meet you, Paul.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.504
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.673
You been here long?

14:41.131 --> 14:42.258
Too long.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.176
This place is like someone you fucked

14:44.260 --> 14:45.719
and they're still under you.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.054
Why don't you quit?

14:47.429 --> 14:48.681
Life's full Of exits.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.850
Because I'm waiting
for it to collapse so I get the payoff.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.812
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.149
Don't look left.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.986
That's an introduction
you don't want to have.

15:02.486 --> 15:03.612
Who's he?

15:04.113 --> 15:07.283
Living example
of everything that's wrong with this paper.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.201
His name's Moburg.

15:09.285 --> 15:12.871
Our Crime
and Religious Affairs correspondent.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.499
Lotterman can't fire him
because he never sees him.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.209
He's rarely out in daylight.

15:17.293 --> 15:18.794
Looks like he enjoys a drink.

15:18.877 --> 15:22.131
The entire substructure
of his brain is eaten away with rum.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.634
I'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.

15:26.010 --> 15:30.264
There's maybe three or four professionals
in the building running the entire show.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.809
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?

15:34.810 --> 15:36.270
In the library. Who's he?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.939
He used to work for the paper.

15:39.023 --> 15:42.318
Now he's what he says he is.
A PR consultant.

15:42.401 --> 15:45.321
Selling this place
street by street to the Yankees.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.199
Keeps a greasy little
bastard of a contact called Segurra.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.119
I saw him. We didn't meet.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.537
Wouldn't bother.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.039
Piss on the make.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.000
The boy, Segurra,
is at the property wickedness.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.878
I'm not sure where Sanderson fits.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.255
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.

16:03.339 --> 16:04.465
He's got some good connections.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.258
He's good for some freelance.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.388
This place is depressing me
beyond belief tonight.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.599
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?

16:15.059 --> 16:16.477
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

16:34.203 --> 16:37.414
I was thinking, if you need somewhere,

16:37.498 --> 16:39.249
I got a room for rent.

16:39.333 --> 16:43.087
Not the best address
in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.463
60 a month.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.757
Sounds inviting. I might remention that.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.592
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.771
Sir...

17:01.105 --> 17:02.815
I was hoping for a swim.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.441
The pool is closed tonight.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.318
Really? Why? What's going on?

17:06.609 --> 17:08.779
It's a Union Carbide party.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.280
It's a private function.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.498
Sorry.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.709
I didn't realize anyone was there.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.919
I thought it was just floating.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.172
It is just floating.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.632
You doing what I'm doing?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.177
I don't think so.

18:13.677 --> 18:14.887
What are you doing?

18:15.012 --> 18:17.347
Escaping the dreadful party.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.975
I just snuck out and unzipped.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.228
Well, that's very courageous of you.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.273
I thought maybe you were a mermaid.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.358
They tell me the coast
is infested with them.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.194
I'm from Connecticut.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.030
My boyfriend's making a speech.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.365
Takes exactly 21 minutes.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.035
Well, then I guess it's pointless,
me inviting you for a drink.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.287
What you got?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.122
No, I mean at the bar.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.460
Pointless.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.047
I'd better go before
they wonder where I went.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.301
Wait a minute. What's your name?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.762
Let's keep that a secret.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.472
I don't even know it.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.224
Well, then you'll keep it even better.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.809
What about your star sign?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.727
I'm an experienced astronomer.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.230
Could try Pisces.

19:06.647 --> 19:07.940
The fish.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.652
Oh, God.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.904
Why did she have to happen?

19:14.738 --> 19:17.115
Just when I was doing so good without her.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.702
What would you say you
like most about Puerto Rico?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.455
The bowling alleys and the casinos.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.541
Course, she likes the duty free.

19:25.624 --> 19:27.793
Well, the more you spend,
the more you save.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.503
Have you seen a lot of the island?

19:30.671 --> 19:32.130
We don't leave the hotel.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.966
It isn't safe.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.050
But you're having fun?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.761
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!

19:39.429 --> 19:41.682
<i>Have some fun with a fucking Luger.</i>

19:42.266 --> 19:44.268
<i>These alleys are magnets
to the glutton.</i>

19:45.394 --> 19:47.145
<i>They come off the
boats like locusts.</i>

19:49.523 --> 19:51.441
<i>Beasts of obesity.</i>

19:52.067 --> 19:53.986
<i>Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.</i>

19:56.113 --> 19:57.614
<i>The great whites.</i>

19:58.156 --> 20:00.492
<i>Probably the most dangerous
creatures on Earth.</i>

20:12.504 --> 20:14.047
There's your baby.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.132
Walt and his woman.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.218
Bowling alleys
isn't exactly what I had in mind.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.887
Tread it till the snow melts,

20:19.970 --> 20:21.388
then join the exodus.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.807
Red light!

20:23.891 --> 20:25.392
Looking for Kemp.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.730
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.565
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place,

20:31.648 --> 20:33.108
they want to read about what's right.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.735
- It's a rewrite.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.486
And while you're at it,

20:36.570 --> 20:38.405
you might want to rewrite
the title and call it

20:38.488 --> 20:40.657
"Ten Things That I Love About Puerto Rico."

20:46.246 --> 20:47.331
So,

20:48.582 --> 20:49.958
how's the sobriety coming along?

20:50.918 --> 20:51.960
I'm cutting down.

20:52.628 --> 20:55.631
By that,
I assume you mean the size of the bottles.

20:58.342 --> 21:01.511
How does anybody drink 161 miniatures?

21:02.512 --> 21:04.431
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.600
What, do they
stock the place four times a day?

21:06.683 --> 21:07.851
Are they not complimentary?

21:07.935 --> 21:09.269
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.563
And neither is wine
and long-distance phone calls.

21:11.647 --> 21:15.192
So, as of Monday,
you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.

21:15.484 --> 21:17.653
And what exactly
brings you into the building?

21:17.736 --> 21:18.779
Don't hazel me.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.615
I got the X-rays back.
I got less than a week to live.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.284
Hazel you? What are you talking
about, you Swedish twerp?

21:24.368 --> 21:27.537
You know, it may have crossed
what's left of your mind

21:27.621 --> 21:29.164
that I have a newspaper to run here,

21:29.247 --> 21:32.167
that we have
something called news going on out there.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.794
But as far as you're concerned,

21:33.877 --> 21:36.088
I might as well look out
of the fuckin' window!

21:36.755 --> 21:38.131
What are you doing here?

21:38.215 --> 21:40.467
This is a newspaper.
There's nothing here for you.

21:40.550 --> 21:44.096
Two of the best scoops
you ever had came out of my brain.

21:44.179 --> 21:47.349
And you better moderate your
language or I'll go elsewhere.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.560
Elsewhere where?
You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.312
You're worthless, Moburg.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.314
The last onion in the jar.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.525
Don't push me, Lotterman.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.985
I'm dangerous when pushed.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.569
I know why you're here.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.238
L'£'$ payday...

22:01.321 --> 22:03.657
But in your case,
deferred on a permanent basis.

22:03.740 --> 22:04.825
You're fired!

22:04.908 --> 22:06.326
You can't fire me.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.744
You owe me money.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.330
And you better pay it,
or I'll come through the roof

22:10.414 --> 22:12.582
and turn this place into
an insurance claim.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.126
Are you threatening me?

22:14.209 --> 22:15.335
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.

22:15.419 --> 22:17.421
You want to suffer some voodoo?

22:17.546 --> 22:18.714
You twerp!

22:18.797 --> 22:20.590
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!

22:21.675 --> 22:23.385
Come on, we're walking.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.429
Did you hear what he said to me?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.180
This guy's my blood pressure.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.765
This guy's going to kill me.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.561
And I want the negative
of that picture destroyed!

22:33.770 --> 22:36.398
I don't want that animal
in this building again.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.191
He is hygienically unacceptable.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.235
Did you see the side of his nose?

22:40.318 --> 22:41.737
Blackheads like Braille.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.655
They should have him put down.

22:45.782 --> 22:46.867
Moburg is history.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.119
He's out of here at the
earliest opportunity.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.081
And the earliest opportunity

22:55.292 --> 22:56.376
is you.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.129
You understand what I'm saying, Kemp?

22:59.546 --> 23:01.048
I think I get the drift.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.300
I want you to
immerse yourself into this paper,

23:03.383 --> 23:05.469
'cause you got
the talent and I think you got the will.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.679
You make it grow
and you grow right along with it.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.682
I'm not best placed to do that.

23:10.766 --> 23:14.061
You think it's my intention to keep you on
horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?

23:15.812 --> 23:18.356
Matter of fact, I'm gonna
move you right now.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.652
Take a cab to the airport.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.988
The mayor of Miami's coming in.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.699
Make him sound nice.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.077
I want a picture and an interview.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.495
Make it work, Paul.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.183
You leaving us already?

23:54.351 --> 23:57.187
I'm moving into an apartment if
this mayor guy ever shows up.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.524
They keep changing "delayed" to "delayed."

24:05.362 --> 24:07.030
You want to have some breakfast?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.865
Little lobster on the beach?

24:09.282 --> 24:10.492
Twenty minutes away.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.160
Sounds inviting,
but I got to wait for the mayor.

24:12.786 --> 24:13.954
Isn't coming.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.080
Canceled.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.332
That's not what it says on the board.

24:17.415 --> 24:18.875
It will in a minute.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.085
I just called Miami.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.504
Come on, let's have some breakfast.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.048
I got a couple things might interest you.

24:27.092 --> 24:28.552
I better call in.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.345
You can call from the car.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.315
All right. Yeah, thanks.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.655
There's only two of those on the island.

24:49.447 --> 24:50.740
Maybe three.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.618
No one told me it was so pretty here.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.913
God's idea of money.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.669
You know what makes
this place a gold mine?

25:03.795 --> 25:05.338
Something that doesn't exist.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.464
How's that?

25:06.548 --> 25:07.841
Land.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.759
There isn't enough of it.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.472
Those who know how to get it
get the gold.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.224
Chenault?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.482
Paul's joining us for breakfast.

26:06.149 --> 26:08.151
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.946
This is Chenault.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.534
You two know each other?

26:16.618 --> 26:19.162
I don't know,
I thought maybe we met on the plane.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.622
I don't think so.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.290
I flew Boyfriend Airlines.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.876
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?

26:25.335 --> 26:26.753
You know what, I might not have time today.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.922
I didn't realize the drive
was gonna take so long.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.006
How much time you got?

26:30.090 --> 26:31.841
In 15 minutes, I'm late.

26:32.175 --> 26:33.760
I'll cut up a pineapple.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.304
You might want to put on some clothes.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.849
She sunbathes in the nude.

26:40.141 --> 26:44.104
A few of the over-tanned locals
tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.605
Doesn't surprise me.

26:45.897 --> 26:48.066
I mean that in a very tasteful way.

26:48.149 --> 26:49.609
It's a private beach.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.944
They shouldn't be here.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.363
Sit down, Paul, sit down.
We'll grab you a cab.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.910
His name's Harry.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.371
Got the idea from a book.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.207
Paul, I wanted to talk,

27:04.374 --> 27:07.043
because I'm looking for someone who can

27:08.044 --> 27:11.548
assimilate contradictory points of view

27:11.631 --> 27:13.341
and make them into one voice.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.302
You're a novelist, right?

27:15.802 --> 27:16.886
Who told you that?

27:17.053 --> 27:19.347
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.475
I'm looking for someone who's good with
words, next day, you turn up.

27:22.559 --> 27:23.852
And 'cause I believe in good luck,

27:23.935 --> 27:25.478
I thought maybe you were it.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.272
What I need

27:28.356 --> 27:30.442
is someone with the right kind of eyes.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.944
For looking at what?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.405
Looking at that.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.286
An ocean of money.

27:54.549 --> 27:55.842
Hey, you made it.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.844
Door at the end.

27:59.596 --> 28:00.847
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.933
Hey. Just give me two minutes.

28:04.434 --> 28:05.810
Walk right in.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.103
All right.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.587
I was trying to
get the place shipshape before you arrived.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.089
<i>Adolf Hitler Speaks?</i>

29:16.172 --> 29:18.842
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.385
Moburg lives here?

29:21.010 --> 29:22.887
He keeps his uniform here.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.473
I never see him
from one month's end to the next.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.979
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.273
Don't look in the kitchen.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.358
The water's off.
There's a problem with the valve.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.111
Thought you said you had a TV.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.196
I said I kind of have a TV.

29:43.491 --> 29:47.704
The guy across the alley
has a TV, I have binoculars.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.289
His wife's deaf.

29:49.372 --> 29:51.666
With the window open, you hear every word.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.877
Here it comes.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.336
Water's coming up.

29:55.462 --> 29:58.006
I noticed
you had some chickens in the bedroom.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.132
Cockerels.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.467
Yeah, I'm sweating the grease out.

30:00.550 --> 30:02.635
Don't worry about them,
I'm moving them to my room.

30:02.719 --> 30:03.803
What do you do with them?

30:03.887 --> 30:05.054
- You eat them?
- Eat them?

30:06.306 --> 30:08.224
Nah. I don't eat them.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.535
Come on, baby, come on!

30:27.619 --> 30:29.370
Get in there, get in there!

30:29.454 --> 30:30.497
Come on!

30:45.803 --> 30:49.140
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy!
On a trade wind!

30:49.224 --> 30:50.433
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.

30:50.517 --> 30:52.810
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!

32:20.189 --> 32:22.358
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.028
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.

32:27.405 --> 32:28.865
Come on, we're out of here.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.995
<i>Come on, rapido, rapido.</i>

32:36.789 --> 32:38.124
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.209
Come on. Come on. Go on.

33:03.191 --> 33:05.902
I tell you, we were
on a roll till that thing turned up.

33:07.487 --> 33:08.863
That's $217.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.156
Not bad.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.075
$217 is a shitload of money.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.409
Relatively a shitload.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.370
They're expensive to train.

33:15.453 --> 33:18.665
I've seen guys win 2,000,
ten on North Beach.

33:18.748 --> 33:20.249
10,000?

33:20.333 --> 33:22.377
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?

33:22.460 --> 33:25.588
You're talking
the environs of the Hilton Hotel.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.674
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.

33:27.757 --> 33:29.592
There's no hope for his kind of hat.

33:32.512 --> 33:35.515
<i>The question, again,
is not one of goals.</i>

33:35.598 --> 33:36.641
<i>We're for those goals.</i>

33:36.724 --> 33:37.767
<i>It's one of means.</i>

33:37.850 --> 33:39.936
<i>Were you claiming
that the Eisenhower administration...</i>

33:40.478 --> 33:43.773
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?

33:44.607 --> 33:47.819
Look at this ingrate
besotted with his own righteousness.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.030
Black is a very dark shade of white.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.116
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.

33:54.492 --> 33:56.411
I can't listen to any more of this.

33:56.494 --> 33:57.787
Lies like he breathes.

33:58.705 --> 34:01.124
Imagine spending your entire life lying.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.750
Holy Christ.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.086
Never got worse.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.341
The only eventuality
worse than him is you know that one day,

34:10.425 --> 34:13.219
some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up,

34:13.302 --> 34:14.929
make him look like a liberal.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.306
The only upside
with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.143
He's got the grin.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.393
He ain't gonna win.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.020
Irish guy's going to win.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.897
But they'll never let him live.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.608
How do you know that?

34:28.275 --> 34:29.652
I do "horror-scopes."

34:32.739 --> 34:34.574
Thought you said he never came here.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.076
He's got filters.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.369
What filters?

34:39.871 --> 34:42.290
He goes over the wall
at the Barcardi plant.

34:42.373 --> 34:46.918
These filters are the last in
line in the distillation process.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.215
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.

34:51.299 --> 34:52.341
What's it like?

34:52.507 --> 34:54.092
A hand on the brain.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.844
Off the scale.

34:55.928 --> 34:57.597
470 proof.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.640
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.981
Certainty you might be
required to moderate.

35:09.692 --> 35:12.612
No smoking
in the extraction area, if you please.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.030
Don't be ridiculous.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.628
Not for the social drinker.

35:30.671 --> 35:31.881
You want to quaff?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.132
No.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.967
Not right now. I got to write.

35:35.051 --> 35:36.177
I got a deadline.

35:36.385 --> 35:38.054
What's he writing?

35:38.346 --> 35:41.015
He's lifting the stone
on the American Dream.

35:41.098 --> 35:42.266
Guayanilla Bay.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.769
Oh, yeah. It's bad down there.

35:45.478 --> 35:48.689
You might find such
a topic attracts a limited readership.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.191
Only need one.

35:50.608 --> 35:52.068
Taking it to Lotterman.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.987
Yeah. Did I hear somebody say "good luck"?

35:56.405 --> 35:59.116
Yeah, I went down there this morning,

35:59.200 --> 36:03.579
he unfired me
on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.

36:03.913 --> 36:06.249
I'd like to bring something
in to Lotterman.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.794
Like a slide-action, "fuck you" gun.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.755
Don't drink that here.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.176
Just a nipperoo, old boy.

36:17.260 --> 36:18.928
Quality test.

36:20.638 --> 36:24.183
Man, slow-motion murder,
just like they do in the movies.

36:25.268 --> 36:27.228
See him flying back,

36:27.311 --> 36:29.981
fuckin' arms flapping in the air.

36:30.648 --> 36:32.275
Okay, mother.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.570
Look upon the last
face you'll see this side of hell!

36:35.820 --> 36:36.904
Bam!

36:38.114 --> 36:43.494
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs
spinning off into flesh orbit.

36:43.578 --> 36:44.829
Bam!

36:44.912 --> 36:46.956
There goes his asshole.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.040
Bam!

36:48.124 --> 36:49.917
There goes his dick.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.919
Bam! Bam!

36:52.712 --> 36:54.213
Fuck you, Lotterman!

36:54.297 --> 36:58.134
You're in a B-fucking movie,
and I am the death machine!

37:01.637 --> 37:03.097
Shall we have some Adolf?

37:03.180 --> 37:04.390
Definitely not.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.684
On your way, on your way, Moburg.

37:07.101 --> 37:08.477
Hey, we're expecting guests.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.521
I thought you said he was writing a book.

37:10.605 --> 37:11.772
Said I was writing an essay.

37:11.856 --> 37:13.649
And it requires some shut mouth.

37:13.983 --> 37:17.069
Don't waste your time
on those junkyard losers.

37:17.612 --> 37:20.406
This country was
built on genocide and slavery.

37:20.489 --> 37:22.283
We killed all the black
guys that were here,

37:22.408 --> 37:25.661
and then
we shipped in new black guys of our own,

37:25.953 --> 37:28.247
and then we
brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.

37:28.331 --> 37:29.415
Let's go.

37:29.498 --> 37:30.791
You know it.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.044
I am the religious correspondent.

37:33.878 --> 37:36.047
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!

37:36.130 --> 37:39.050
If the Bible's God's
book, why didn't He give it to everyone?

37:42.845 --> 37:47.016
"We give more money to parking
meters than we do to kids to eat."

37:47.099 --> 37:49.518
Don't read me like that.
I've done the research.

37:50.311 --> 37:54.398
12,000-ton rust bucket went down in the
bay full of hydrochloric acid.

37:54.690 --> 37:55.900
Killed off everything in the sea.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.194
Killed off the fishermen.
Their kids are picking garbage.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.654
All right, don't get angry.

37:59.737 --> 38:00.947
It's hot outside.

38:02.156 --> 38:03.240
You want a Scotch?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.408
Yeah.

38:06.243 --> 38:09.038
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,

38:09.121 --> 38:11.082
I might have said go after it.

38:12.041 --> 38:13.751
Now I say go with it.

38:14.543 --> 38:15.795
There's nothing you can change.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.799
Sometimes you just
got to spew over the side and keep rowing.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.094
Into a nut brown sunset.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.972
It's the land of multiple outrage.

38:26.889 --> 38:29.558
Thousands trodden on
before you wake up for breakfast.

38:30.518 --> 38:33.062
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.731
And providing it isn't their sunset,

38:35.815 --> 38:38.651
nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.

38:38.734 --> 38:40.569
You underestimate your readers.

38:40.653 --> 38:41.696
I don't think so.

38:41.779 --> 38:43.489
You underestimate me.

38:43.739 --> 38:46.158
You told me to make it work,
that's what I want to do.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.661
Wind down this La Zonga crap
and make a newspaper.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.329
Let me tell you some home truth.

38:50.413 --> 38:53.624
This paper's been on its knees to a
bank since the day it opened.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.835
And like most every other
newspaper on Earth,

38:55.918 --> 38:57.336
it's financed by its advertising.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.630
And without advertising,
not only is there no La Zonga,

38:59.714 --> 39:01.590
there's no paper to put it in, so, thus,

39:01.674 --> 39:04.176
there are one or two things
that we don't write about.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.761
In other words, nothing at all.

39:05.845 --> 39:07.763
In one other word, discretion.

39:08.264 --> 39:09.682
You're not a foreign correspondent

39:09.765 --> 39:13.019
in some far-flung
foreign land, this is America.

39:13.185 --> 39:14.395
This is Puerto Rico.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.856
This is America.

39:16.939 --> 39:19.191
You think some plumber
from Normal, Illinois,

39:19.275 --> 39:22.236
saves up for 25 years
to come here on a cruise ship

39:22.319 --> 39:24.864
to read about bad times
in the sugar plantation?

39:24.947 --> 39:26.866
They don't give a fuck!

39:26.949 --> 39:28.534
The average guy don't rock the boat,

39:28.617 --> 39:30.327
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.

39:30.411 --> 39:33.080
And our readership is vividly average.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.543
They don't care who the losers are.

39:37.626 --> 39:40.421
They want to know who won.

39:40.504 --> 39:41.714
Who won the bowls,

39:41.797 --> 39:44.884
who won the races,
who won the pot at the slot machines.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.263
Look at me, Kemp.

39:50.014 --> 39:52.016
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.602
And this is the American Dream.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.023
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.108
You can see the sea
by checking into the hotels.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.443
Pay to see the sea?

40:02.943 --> 40:04.445
What's the matter with that?

40:04.528 --> 40:06.322
You're paying to be in the dream.

40:08.157 --> 40:09.575
There's a thin veneer, Kemp,

40:09.658 --> 40:11.327
between the dream and the reality.

40:11.744 --> 40:15.289
You wake them up and the people might
start asking for their money back.

40:21.754 --> 40:23.255
You're the boss.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.175
Not quite.

40:27.093 --> 40:30.846
The editorial policy
of this newspaper is owned by the dream.

41:21.063 --> 41:22.398
Oh, God.

41:27.570 --> 41:30.531
Oh, Christ.

41:35.703 --> 41:38.956
Oh, God, look at that.

41:39.039 --> 41:42.168
Oh, God!

41:43.502 --> 41:44.753
Hal?

41:45.421 --> 41:46.839
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.799
I was looking at his boat.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.676
She's a sweet little beauty.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.094
You been aboard?

41:52.178 --> 41:53.345
No.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.847
Great little island hopper.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.765
We've all been down on her.

41:56.849 --> 41:58.809
It's a wonderful experience.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.483
You two are early.

42:06.567 --> 42:07.610
You got lucky.

42:07.693 --> 42:08.819
Yeah.

42:09.111 --> 42:10.112
Did you meet?

42:10.196 --> 42:11.822
Yeah, we got first names.

42:11.906 --> 42:15.910
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S.
Marines, great friend of mine.

42:15.993 --> 42:18.537
<i>This is Mr. Paul Kemp,
New York Times.</i>

42:18.621 --> 42:19.872
You're the writer.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.123
Paul's a novelist.

42:24.168 --> 42:25.502
<i>New York Times?</i>

42:25.586 --> 42:27.504
He don't know one from the other.

42:27.588 --> 42:29.548
Just go with it. This guy's key.

42:29.632 --> 42:30.966
Key to what?

42:31.634 --> 42:33.844
Key to the discussion we're about to have.

42:37.556 --> 42:39.183
Look at those mothers.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.186
Come with me, Kemp.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.023
This is a private beach.

42:46.106 --> 42:47.316
We are not on it.

42:47.399 --> 42:49.151
No, but we are!

42:49.235 --> 42:51.153
And what we do is private!

42:52.529 --> 42:54.240
Now get the fuck gone!

42:57.243 --> 42:59.036
Get the fuck out of here!

42:59.328 --> 43:00.579
I see your face again,

43:00.663 --> 43:03.624
you're gonna have a 12-gauge shotgun
telling you what to do.

43:12.925 --> 43:14.802
Talking about Satan...

43:14.885 --> 43:18.180
If there ever was
a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

43:19.181 --> 43:22.518
The only way to come
to terms with Communism is to destroy it.

43:23.227 --> 43:27.439
Hit it before it hits us
in a devastating democratic strike.

43:27.523 --> 43:29.108
No more for the major.

43:31.026 --> 43:32.695
They're looking for a man
to push that button,

43:33.028 --> 43:34.446
I am that man.

43:34.530 --> 43:36.532
Yes, you are, honey.

43:38.367 --> 43:39.785
You look ravishing, Chenault.

43:39.868 --> 43:41.120
Thank you.

43:41.203 --> 43:42.246
You need rescuing?

43:42.329 --> 43:43.747
Don't take him away.

43:43.831 --> 43:45.457
He's very entertaining.

43:46.583 --> 43:50.963
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't know,
we kind of veered off, didn't we?

43:51.046 --> 43:53.424
Paul presents us
with a somewhat liberal point of view.

43:53.507 --> 43:55.175
There is no such thing as a liberal.

43:55.259 --> 43:58.721
A liberal is a Commie with a college
education thinking Negro thoughts.

43:59.013 --> 44:01.140
Well, here's a fact for you.

44:01.307 --> 44:05.728
76.4% of all Negroes
are controlled from Moscow.

44:05.978 --> 44:08.731
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.

44:08.814 --> 44:11.692
In my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,

44:11.775 --> 44:13.152
- let its people live in peace.
- Art.

44:13.235 --> 44:15.487
Hey. Come on, let's eat.

44:15.821 --> 44:16.947
Come on.

44:21.869 --> 44:23.078
Who's the guy in the shades?

44:23.162 --> 44:26.540
Segurra's Daddy.
It's who you're waiting for.

44:28.292 --> 44:30.252
Thank you for my roses.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.130
I didn't think you noticed.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.090
Of course I noticed.

44:38.761 --> 44:40.846
Paul, would you mind joining us?

44:47.144 --> 44:48.187
How do you do, sir?

44:48.270 --> 44:49.480
- Mr. Kemp.
- Nice to see you.

44:49.563 --> 44:50.647
Mr. Kemp.

44:53.442 --> 44:54.485
Okay.

44:54.568 --> 44:57.404
Let me just start by saying
this is a purely informal meeting.

44:57.488 --> 45:00.824
And, incidentally,
you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?

45:00.908 --> 45:02.076
Lotterman?

45:02.159 --> 45:04.453
<i>What the hell's Lotterman
got to do with The New York Times?</i>

45:04.536 --> 45:06.538
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.

45:06.622 --> 45:08.040
Occasionally, he writes for the news.

45:08.123 --> 45:10.250
What he does in his spare
time is his affair.

45:10.334 --> 45:11.668
That's how I like it.

45:11.752 --> 45:13.128
We'd like you to do some writing for us.

45:13.379 --> 45:14.546
So I gather.

45:14.630 --> 45:15.923
About what?

45:16.006 --> 45:18.133
In a sentence, we want to set something up,

45:18.342 --> 45:20.427
and have the public as our friends.

45:20.511 --> 45:22.763
And there are a variety
of ways we can do that.

45:25.808 --> 45:28.268
Let me tell you
how this kind of thing works, Paul.

45:28.352 --> 45:32.564
Suppose, by way of example,
you wanted to put up taxes by 5%.

45:32.648 --> 45:34.024
The smart way of doing it

45:34.191 --> 45:36.985
is to float the idea of a 10% hike.

45:37.069 --> 45:39.696
Let them all shout about it,
get themselves in a fuss,

45:39.780 --> 45:41.031
then you offer concessions.

45:41.115 --> 45:43.075
"How about 7%?" "No way," they'll say.

45:43.158 --> 45:48.580
"All right, let's stay friends
and make a compromise at five."

45:48.664 --> 45:49.665
Bingo.

45:49.748 --> 45:53.335
They think they won something, you get
the 5% you wanted in the first place.

45:53.419 --> 45:55.254
Same thing applies to real estate.

45:55.587 --> 45:57.423
You want to build five houses,

45:57.506 --> 45:59.800
you put in a planning application for 50.

46:00.717 --> 46:01.927
How many do you want to build?

46:02.010 --> 46:03.178
None.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.222
We want to build one hotel.

46:05.681 --> 46:06.807
Well, looking around this place,

46:06.890 --> 46:08.434
I don't think anyone would notice.

46:09.017 --> 46:10.310
It isn't in this place.

46:10.394 --> 46:11.603
It's an island.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.315
Sensitive for a variety
of reasons we don't want to get into now.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.026
Nobody wants a paradise
choked with hotels, but

46:18.902 --> 46:21.447
everybody will be pleased
to compromise at one.

46:21.697 --> 46:23.615
This is going to require
some clever writing

46:23.699 --> 46:25.325
in various carefully placed articles.

46:26.493 --> 46:28.328
Isn't that kind of thing illegal?

46:28.412 --> 46:29.872
If I may say, Mr. Kemp,

46:30.747 --> 46:32.624
that's an inappropriate comment.

46:33.542 --> 46:34.835
Where's the island?

46:34.918 --> 46:35.961
Can't tell you.

46:36.044 --> 46:37.129
Not yet.

46:37.212 --> 46:39.798
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.

46:39.882 --> 46:42.050
If you want to join us,
you'll have to sign some papers.

46:42.885 --> 46:45.137
We're having a meeting
tomorrow in Hal's office.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.388
If you want to be part of what will be

46:46.472 --> 46:49.391
a very exciting project, come along.

46:49.725 --> 46:52.227
There's a man outside
in a funny little car for Paul.

46:52.311 --> 46:53.312
Oh, yeah.

46:53.395 --> 46:54.730
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.315
I have to run.

47:02.362 --> 47:03.572
Can't stay?

47:03.655 --> 47:06.158
I hear the mermaids
come out in the moonlight.

47:12.706 --> 47:15.626
From the moment we met, I knew

47:15.876 --> 47:18.212
there was going to be something between us.

47:18.545 --> 47:19.963
It's called her fiancé.

47:20.047 --> 47:23.467
God, I'm so hopelessly
and progressively in love.

47:23.926 --> 47:25.844
Do not confuse love with lust,

47:26.178 --> 47:28.055
nor drunkenness with judgment.

47:29.223 --> 47:30.265
You want my advice?

47:30.349 --> 47:31.975
No. If it involves her, no, I don't.

47:32.059 --> 47:33.435
Stay away from her.

47:33.519 --> 47:34.853
And stay away from Sanderson.

47:34.937 --> 47:36.146
You're way out of depth.

47:36.230 --> 47:38.941
I got no brief for Sanderson
or his pissy rip-off island.

47:39.566 --> 47:42.528
I just want some
apple blossom lipstick and fucks.

47:42.736 --> 47:44.530
You are in total denial.

47:44.613 --> 47:45.822
She's fucking someone else.

47:45.906 --> 47:49.409
And as I understand it,
about to be married to him.

47:50.452 --> 47:52.120
You won't even make an invite.

47:54.164 --> 47:55.499
I don't believe this.

47:55.958 --> 47:57.626
We're right back where we started.

47:58.627 --> 48:00.504
That is the same Cabrones we passed

48:00.587 --> 48:01.964
ten minutes ago.

48:10.889 --> 48:12.766
We need directions.

48:13.809 --> 48:15.978
Let's get in there and
get something to eat.

48:19.189 --> 48:20.440
No.

48:20.524 --> 48:21.650
Please, no.

48:21.858 --> 48:25.779
I haven't spent all day
on a beach munching lobster with criminals,

48:25.862 --> 48:27.072
and I'm starving.

49:05.736 --> 49:08.864
Two beers, two rums, one steak.

49:08.947 --> 49:09.990
The kitchen is closed.

49:10.073 --> 49:11.533
All right then, two beers and two rums.

49:11.825 --> 49:13.410
And one steak.

49:13.493 --> 49:14.911
Cerrado, Mister...

49:14.995 --> 49:17.247
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.

49:17.331 --> 49:22.377
You got a sign down there saying, "Food
till midnight," and I want a steak.

49:27.299 --> 49:28.717
Girl of the swamp.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.720
Which reminds me, we need a map.

49:32.054 --> 49:33.347
You know what I think?

49:34.264 --> 49:36.016
I think we're drinking too much rum.

49:36.350 --> 49:37.392
There's no other way.

49:37.809 --> 49:42.648
I'm getting double ashtray
and double salt pot.

49:43.398 --> 49:45.192
You got a Moburg bifocal.

49:46.068 --> 49:47.569
Christ, this is heinous.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.238
Imagine what it must be like
to be an alcoholic.

49:51.365 --> 49:52.574
$2.

49:53.116 --> 49:55.202
You pay and you go

49:55.577 --> 49:56.995
I don't see a steak.

49:57.621 --> 49:58.914
No steak.

49:58.997 --> 50:00.248
What do you mean, no steak?

50:01.083 --> 50:02.668
I think he means no steak.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.379
The kitchen is closed.

50:05.462 --> 50:06.880
I got no way of serving you.

50:07.214 --> 50:10.676
Listen, you don't want
to hear about my bad day,

50:10.759 --> 50:13.220
and I don't want no grave side out of you.

50:13.303 --> 50:16.098
If you can't cook it, bring it like it is.
I'll eat it raw.

50:16.431 --> 50:19.309
Two dollars, you pay and go.

50:19.393 --> 50:20.811
Don't bother me.

50:20.894 --> 50:23.438
You pay now, or I call the cops.

50:23.939 --> 50:26.650
If you have no intention
of serving me steak,

50:26.733 --> 50:29.111
why don't you do your best to fuck off.

50:45.585 --> 50:48.130
It seems to me there's
a bad vibe developing.

50:49.047 --> 50:51.466
There are one or two oddities
giving us the eye.

50:51.883 --> 50:53.093
Don't get paranoid.

50:53.176 --> 50:54.553
He's on the phone.

50:54.678 --> 50:55.721
For what?

50:55.804 --> 50:57.055
Ordering food in a restaurant?

50:57.139 --> 50:59.307
Let's hope he's through to the FBI.

51:04.271 --> 51:05.522
What's the matter?

51:05.856 --> 51:07.190
What are you smiling at?

51:07.983 --> 51:09.401
I'm not smiling.

51:09.985 --> 51:11.611
I'm maintaining a casual face.

51:15.282 --> 51:17.117
A man just walked in

51:17.200 --> 51:20.746
and has good reason
for regarding us in a negative light.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.330
- Us?
- Me.

51:22.456 --> 51:24.249
And he's just seen me

51:24.332 --> 51:27.210
And he wants revenge on the white man.

51:28.420 --> 51:30.130
The fuck are you talking about?

51:31.381 --> 51:33.133
How about the one with the dent?

51:36.178 --> 51:37.220
The one with the eye?

51:37.304 --> 51:38.388
The very same.

51:39.931 --> 51:41.516
Do we walk or run?

51:42.434 --> 51:43.518
Walk.

51:43.643 --> 51:44.644
I'll push the car.

51:53.445 --> 51:55.197
Let's walk and hope he's happy.

52:09.878 --> 52:11.671
Hey, Yankee.

52:11.755 --> 52:13.173
Yankee!

52:33.610 --> 52:35.362
Don't let me see headlights.

52:36.738 --> 52:38.532
Please don't let me see headlights.

52:40.283 --> 52:41.868
I just seen headlights.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.120
Put your foot down.

52:44.204 --> 52:45.747
Where exactly do you think I got it?

52:56.258 --> 52:57.759
Can you go faster?

52:57.843 --> 52:59.094
Going fast as I can.

53:19.781 --> 53:21.032
Jesus Christ, man.

53:44.264 --> 53:46.516
We're gonna be killed!
We're gonna be killed!

53:52.105 --> 53:53.356
Hey!

53:58.570 --> 54:00.071
Get ready to run.

54:00.155 --> 54:01.364
Run in opposite directions.

54:01.448 --> 54:02.449
Give me the brew!

54:02.532 --> 54:03.617
Give me the fucking brew!

54:23.178 --> 54:24.387
Paul!

54:47.869 --> 54:50.580
Piece of luck. I just saw Moburg.

54:51.039 --> 54:52.666
At least I think he saw us.

54:55.085 --> 54:57.545
They got some kind of night court going.

55:11.476 --> 55:13.812
He says we were animals

55:13.895 --> 55:17.107
on a rampage of drunken anarchy,

55:17.190 --> 55:19.067
poured gasoline on one of his cops.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.783
Oh, my God, we're doomed.

55:27.409 --> 55:28.827
You have something to say?

55:30.495 --> 55:32.580
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

55:33.415 --> 55:37.669
Firstly, this guy
handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.

55:38.920 --> 55:42.298
And second,
we'd like a translation of the charges.

55:42.674 --> 55:43.800
You heard what they said?

55:44.050 --> 55:47.470
With respect,
I heard people speaking Spanish.

55:48.263 --> 55:51.433
What kind of language do you think we
speak in this country, Mister?

55:58.064 --> 55:59.107
He's not with us.

55:59.357 --> 56:01.943
The cops attached him to get a conviction.

56:02.902 --> 56:05.655
Did you leave
the Café Cabrones without paying?

56:07.699 --> 56:10.702
Did you set fire
to the police officer, yes or no?

56:10.785 --> 56:12.829
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
he got in the way of our flame.

56:13.121 --> 56:14.330
That's right.

56:14.414 --> 56:18.376
No way did we pour
gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.

56:18.877 --> 56:19.878
It wasn't like he said.

56:19.961 --> 56:21.337
Like he said?

56:21.463 --> 56:23.381
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.

56:23.631 --> 56:25.508
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.

56:25.592 --> 56:27.552
Well, he will
have plenty of opportunity to learn.

56:27.886 --> 56:29.637
The charges against you are grave.

56:29.721 --> 56:33.183
Resisting arrest carries a tariff
alone of one year in prison.

56:33.266 --> 56:35.518
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.

56:36.144 --> 56:38.563
I'm going to refer this
case to a higher court.

56:38.646 --> 56:41.900
Meanwhile,
I remand you both in custody for 30 days.

56:45.570 --> 56:46.905
If I may, Your Honor.

56:57.791 --> 56:58.917
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.

56:59.042 --> 57:00.502
Thank you, Your Honor.

57:00.627 --> 57:02.796
It isn't my purpose to
interrupt proceedings,

57:02.879 --> 57:06.591
but if the intention
is to remand these gentlemen,

57:06.674 --> 57:08.968
I would respectfully ask for a brief recess

57:09.052 --> 57:10.720
to allow me to contact their counsel.

57:11.304 --> 57:12.514
Who is who?

57:12.597 --> 57:13.765
Alfredo Quinones.

57:16.351 --> 57:18.228
It would necessitate
getting him out of bed, of course.

57:18.353 --> 57:21.731
But given the importance
of these gentlemen to

57:22.524 --> 57:24.025
various interests,

57:25.360 --> 57:27.695
I'm sure that he would be as pleased as I

57:28.905 --> 57:31.074
to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.

57:37.038 --> 57:38.623
How much did we cost him?

57:38.706 --> 57:40.708
About $1,000 apiece.

57:53.263 --> 57:54.681
I can't thank you enough.

57:55.473 --> 57:56.724
Don't be late.

58:24.752 --> 58:26.212
Mother of balls!

58:27.881 --> 58:29.632
We got to rescue the car.

58:30.592 --> 58:31.843
Not now. We'll do it later.

58:31.926 --> 58:33.136
I've got a meeting.

58:33.428 --> 58:35.013
We do not have later.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.557
They've already had it 12 hours.

58:38.266 --> 58:40.268
I know how these bastards work.

58:40.852 --> 58:44.022
They can strip a train
to axles in 12 minutes.

58:45.607 --> 58:47.442
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.

58:51.779 --> 58:53.281
How long is this gonna take?

58:53.364 --> 58:54.532
How would I know?

58:54.616 --> 58:55.700
I can't be late.

58:55.783 --> 58:57.535
I don't know why you're going at all.

58:57.619 --> 58:59.204
That guy is bad company.

58:59.412 --> 59:01.039
He's a manipulative prick.

59:01.122 --> 59:03.374
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?

59:03.458 --> 59:05.126
Now he fucking owns us.

59:06.753 --> 59:08.463
I got a tongue like...

59:10.298 --> 59:11.633
Like a towel.

59:11.966 --> 59:13.218
Want a beer?

59:14.260 --> 59:15.720
Do I want a beer?

59:17.180 --> 59:18.681
No, I do not.

59:20.099 --> 59:22.060
I am never gonna touch alcohol again.

59:34.822 --> 59:36.616
What fresh hell is this?

59:36.991 --> 59:38.451
Front seat's gone.

59:38.993 --> 59:40.703
That's a write-off. Isn't it?

59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.390
You know what, I've got a brilliant idea.

01:00:23.538 --> 01:00:25.081
What's that?

01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:27.292
There's too much weight on the axle.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:29.419
Try and move forward a bit.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:30.962
Gonna be late.

01:00:31.045 --> 01:00:33.047
I'm gonna be a week late.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.052
What are you doing, Sala?

01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:41.097
I suddenly realize how much I like you.

01:00:41.389 --> 01:00:42.682
What do you mean, what am I doing?

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:45.393
There's something wrong with the axle.

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:52.859
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:59.032
Try and look normal.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.791
Make a right! Make a right!

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.543
- What right? There is no right.
- Any right!

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:39.113
There he is. Paul, come in.

01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:41.532
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:43.618
I had to go home and start the day again.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:46.996
Tell me about it.
Some days are two sizes too small.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.873
Well, I'm afraid some of us had to leave.

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:50.875
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.544
And this is Mr. Green
of First National Maritime Bank.

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.629
You want some coffee?

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:56.672
I think we should move right along, Hal.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.049
- I gotta go.
- Sure.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:01:59.634
Sit down, Paul.

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.178
As you may know, Mr. Kemp,

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.223
the island is owned by the U.S. government.

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:07.809
Part of it presently
used as a target range by the Navy.

01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:10.186
We know from internal sources...

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:11.437
Is that what you're calling me?

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:16.401
That the government
is preparing to relinquish the lease,

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.361
and this place wakes up as 32 square miles

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:21.030
of magnificent and untouched real estate.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.533
Knock your eyes out.

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:25.785
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.

01:02:26.369 --> 01:02:29.705
Orientated around
one hell of a beautiful marina.

01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:33.000
Thought it was one hotel.

01:02:33.084 --> 01:02:34.585
We start with one hotel.

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:35.878
It's a foot in the door.

01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:38.339
Once we're up and running,
we're servants of a market.

01:02:39.048 --> 01:02:40.842
- Like here?
- Like here.

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:43.261
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.

01:02:44.387 --> 01:02:46.222
He's not worried.

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:47.598
Paul and I shared a tricky little night.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:50.268
Right, Paul?

01:02:50.643 --> 01:02:51.894
Neither of us got much sleep.

01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:54.981
I gotta 90, guys.

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:57.024
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.

01:02:57.191 --> 01:02:58.651
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:00.528
Doing that right now.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:03.531
What am I actually signing?

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:06.033
Just a confidentiality
agreement, affirmation of trust.

01:03:06.117 --> 01:03:08.953
Just so we're all sitting
in the same Jacuzzi.

01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:12.165
In case a turd floats up,
if you know what I mean.

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.004
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.968
Here you go.

01:03:25.553 --> 01:03:27.221
It's just a technicality, Paul.

01:03:27.305 --> 01:03:30.933
Means you promise
not to talk to anybody about the project.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.477
How's the head?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.936
Unpleasant.

01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:36.397
Gotta thank you again for
putting up the bail.

01:03:36.898 --> 01:03:38.858
It's held on my cognizance.

01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:42.361
And I think it
more than likely to slip various minds.

01:03:43.196 --> 01:03:45.615
This place is a sea of money, Paul.

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.617
Unbelievable money.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:51.412
Practically every
major corporation hides its cash offshore.

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:52.830
No, thanks.

01:03:52.914 --> 01:03:55.416
And that is good news for us,

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:58.252
because we are the shore.

01:03:59.754 --> 01:04:02.173
Not one dollar
that wings its way into Puerto Rico

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.758
pays a cent in tax.

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:05.760
- Nothing?
- Not penny one.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.053
That includes chemical companies,

01:04:07.136 --> 01:04:08.679
oil companies, mining companies.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.765
There's $12 billion worth of copper

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:13.267
in mountains less than 20 miles from here.

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:15.728
A dozen billion dollars.

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:20.441
And there's people like me

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.818
who know how to get it out.

01:04:24.737 --> 01:04:27.615
So, putting it into context,

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:31.452
I don't envisage the breaking of
bones to get at a thousand bucks.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.830
Because you weren't here,

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:37.333
I agreed to an itinerary
with Zimburger on your behalf.

01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:40.962
You'll be traveling down in the morning.
Hope that's okay.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.760
What do you need, Paul?

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:51.305
Well, just in the context
of this Zimburger thing,

01:04:51.389 --> 01:04:54.475
do you think
there's a possibility of an advance?

01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:57.728
I don't like to ask,
but Lotterman's pretty erratic

01:04:57.812 --> 01:04:59.313
with the paycheck, you know.

01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:00.439
Need to get a hold of a car.

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:01.857
You don't have a car?

01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:03.693
Nothing too reliable.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:06.153
Plus, sooner or later, I'm gonna
have to find a decent place to live.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.613
Well, we can help you with that.

01:05:07.697 --> 01:05:11.033
When you get back,
we'll sort you out something with a view.

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:15.621
Carol, what do we have in the garage?

01:05:16.539 --> 01:05:18.833
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.377
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you.

01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:25.339
Got you a car.
She'll give you the keys on the way out.

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:30.052
Feels like 500?

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:33.681
Yeah. Thanks.

01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:36.475
Paul...

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:38.603
How's your afternoon?

01:05:38.686 --> 01:05:40.271
A half-written horoscope.

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:43.107
Do me a favor, will you?
Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.650
I need her downstairs by 6:00.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.068
All right.

01:06:29.278 --> 01:06:30.863
So, this one?

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:33.574
Or...

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:36.744
This one?

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:38.829
What are these for, a party?

01:06:38.913 --> 01:06:40.581
It's for carnival.

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:42.917
Didn't he say anything to you about it?

01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:45.878
- No.
- You've got to come.

01:06:46.212 --> 01:06:48.464
We're all going down on the boat.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.092
He didn't invite me.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:53.219
Well, it isn't his carnival.

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:55.429
This one.

01:06:58.432 --> 01:06:59.684
I like the other one.

01:07:04.814 --> 01:07:05.898
Yes.

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.788
Love this car.

01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:24.125
Did he give it to you?

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:25.793
I Wish.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:28.087
Fast.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:31.841
You want a little bet?

01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:34.635
A bet about what?

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.221
That you scream before I do.

01:07:39.557 --> 01:07:41.684
That I scream
before you do, in relation to what?

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.770
Well, how fast does it go?

01:07:45.813 --> 01:07:47.314
I don't know.

01:07:49.984 --> 01:07:51.485
That's the bet.

01:07:57.158 --> 01:07:59.452
I already crashed one car today.

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:06.500
It's okay. I'll just go sit in
the foyer and wait for him.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.432
What do I get if I win?

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.602
I'll let you know if you do.

01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:15.754
Come on, I'll take you back.

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:29.476
Christ, where'd they get this?

01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:33.147
I don't remember.
I've been slightly avoiding Lotterman.

01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:35.691
You have me to thank for your freedom.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:36.984
Thanks.

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.445
I got a feeling of total anxiety

01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:43.324
trying to put my anxieties
together in a single, coherent lump.

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:45.743
I'm fucked without a car.

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:46.994
I got us a car.

01:10:47.328 --> 01:10:49.246
It's the Chevy downstairs.

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:51.457
It belongs to Mr. Sanderson.

01:10:51.749 --> 01:10:52.833
So what?

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:55.044
I gotta go type this up.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:00.466
I don't know what's going on.

01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:02.968
He's freaking out and we're down 12 pages.

01:11:05.346 --> 01:11:06.555
You better frigging do it!

01:11:06.639 --> 01:11:08.599
I see your filthy animal
face in here again,

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.684
I'll have you locked up!

01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:13.103
What part of the building
are you creeping towards, Sala?

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.772
- Darkroom.
- Cops are looking for you.

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:16.148
- Looking for me?
- Looking for you.

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:17.900
And it ain't just your mug in the paper!

01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:19.777
What a day.

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:21.820
What a week.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.280
I tell you, I'm out of here.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:25.199
One way to friggin' Mexico.

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:29.161
Listen, I got a trip tomorrow.
Sanderson's island.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.996
- No, no, no.
- Oh, dear.

01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:33.958
It's green money, and I'm thinking of
cutting across for the carnival.

01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:35.459
You know they
got that carnival in Saint Thomas.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:36.794
I know.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:39.004
Why don't you come with me?

01:11:39.088 --> 01:11:41.298
Give the cops a few days to forget.

01:11:41.382 --> 01:11:43.509
Yeah. Fun.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.712
Our guys. 12-inch Naval, 14 miles out.

01:12:20.254 --> 01:12:21.964
Nobody lives here?

01:12:22.423 --> 01:12:23.757
No one who's staying.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.135
Lazar!

01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:27.553
Mr. Zimburger.

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:34.226
This is Mr. Lazar,
our much put-upon site architect.

01:12:34.309 --> 01:12:35.519
- How do you do.
- Hello.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:36.687
Mr. Monk, I think you know.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.605
I assist Mr. Green, First Maritime Bank.

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:40.649
<i>This is Mr. Kemp from
The New York Times.</i>

01:12:40.733 --> 01:12:41.775
What did you say your name was?

01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:43.652
- Bob Sala.
- Yeah, Sala.

01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:46.447
From American Travel Writers Association.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:51.326
Mr. Kemp is preparing our brochure.

01:12:52.077 --> 01:12:53.871
"Wish you were here."

01:12:54.872 --> 01:12:56.081
Beer in the cooler, gentlemen.

01:12:56.165 --> 01:12:58.292
I have everything next door.

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.796
This and this are the main hotels.

01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:04.715
22 floors.

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:07.301
Guardians of the bay, so to speak.

01:13:07.843 --> 01:13:09.261
Why the different colors?

01:13:09.845 --> 01:13:12.973
Blue is for public
dissemination, red is for the investors.

01:13:13.057 --> 01:13:16.810
Yeah. Hill villas, ocean condos.

01:13:18.979 --> 01:13:20.189
Marina.

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.317
Parking for 2,000 cars.

01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:24.777
There's no roads.

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:27.821
Damn it, Lazar, you forgot the roads!

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.326
We're building them. We're building them.

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:35.204
Let's have some lunch.

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:55.849
10,000 waiters, maids,
bellhops, janitors, clerks.

01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:01.146
Plus, whores for the fat man.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.440
Hard to believe they'd do it.

01:14:11.073 --> 01:14:13.992
I was talking to that
architect kind of guy.

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:17.121
He's going
to Saint Thomas, if you want a ride.

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:18.330
When?

01:14:18.413 --> 01:14:19.957
How do I know when?

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.000
When he's finished here.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:24.878
You know what Oscar Wilde said?

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.590
"They know the price of everything,

01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:31.301
"the value of nothing."

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:51.738
Two rums.

01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:54.241
I thought you'd given up.

01:14:54.575 --> 01:14:56.577
Finally beat my willpower.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.165
Come on, let's go here.

01:15:15.304 --> 01:15:17.097
<i>He)', mi amigo!</i>

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:21.268
Hey, Rosie's a singer.

01:16:02.893 --> 01:16:04.144
Paul!

01:16:07.439 --> 01:16:08.565
Where's Hal?

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:10.275
- Boat
- Boat?

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:12.361
Help me find my girlfriend.

01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:19.159
Hey! How are you?

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:21.954
Watch your step.

01:16:22.037 --> 01:16:23.205
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:24.289
- There we go.
- Thank you.

01:16:24.373 --> 01:16:25.415
Hi.

01:16:25.499 --> 01:16:26.917
Look at you.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:29.711
Good. Grab some champagne.

01:16:30.128 --> 01:16:31.213
Hey, Captain.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.970
Did you take Sala to the island?

01:16:41.807 --> 01:16:44.101
You shouldn't have done that, Paul.

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:46.061
It's why we have a
confidentiality agreement.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:47.688
He isn't interested.

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.898
He's got a mouth like an AP wire.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.529
I just don't know what he was doing there.

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:58.782
And I sure as shit don't
know what he's doing here.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:31.023
Not going glum on us, are you?

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:34.067
Just thoughts.

01:17:35.527 --> 01:17:36.903
What's the book?

01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:39.281
<i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.</i>

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:42.784
It was written in 1797
by a junkie called Coleridge.

01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:47.539
He wrote that when he was 25 years old.

01:17:49.249 --> 01:17:52.586
I've been dragging
a typewriter around with me for 10.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:54.171
I've written nothing.

01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:56.131
You've written some books.

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:57.382
Nah.

01:17:57.883 --> 01:17:59.551
They had no voice.

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:05.182
I don't know how to write like me.

01:18:10.103 --> 01:18:11.605
I resent that.

01:18:11.772 --> 01:18:13.648
No, I really have to say he's all right.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:14.983
I have to admit.

01:18:15.067 --> 01:18:16.902
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

01:18:16.985 --> 01:18:18.070
Thank you for the afternoon.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:19.613
Maybe we'll see you in town.

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:20.781
Where you going?

01:18:21.448 --> 01:18:22.991
Her friend's playing in a band.

01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:24.326
We're gonna go check it out.

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.535
We want to come.

01:18:26.203 --> 01:18:27.496
I'll rephrase that.

01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:28.830
We don't want to come.

01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:30.707
Yes, we do. Us girls want to dance.

01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:32.709
You're dancing tomorrow.

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:35.587
What's the point of going to carnival
if everything is preplanned?

01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:37.881
I want to dance,
and if you're not going to take me,

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:39.716
- I'm gonna go with them.
- She's got you trumped, Hal.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.009
Sit down. You're drunk.

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:43.470
So what? So is everyone else.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:44.805
Come on.

01:18:45.097 --> 01:18:47.307
Come on, let's do it. It might be amusing.

01:18:56.108 --> 01:18:57.484
<i>Oh, cuidado. Careful.</i>

01:18:58.318 --> 01:18:59.486
Here we go.

01:19:25.262 --> 01:19:26.555
Yeah.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.445
We're done. We're spent.

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:42.737
- You're gonna go?
- Yes, we're gonna leave.

01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:43.822
You're done?

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:45.282
I can't dance no more. Really.

01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:48.201
Hold on. You know what? I'll be out.
Let me just get Chenault.

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.041
You want rum or beer?

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.293
Both.

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:59.713
<i>Dos rum, dos cervezas.</i>

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:00.964
- Whoa, whoa.
- We're gonna go.

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:02.632
- Hey.
- We're gonna go.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.801
- What?
- Natalie's leaving,

01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:06.178
- so let's go.
- Hey, hey.

01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.180
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.726
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:16.438
- Chenault.
- Stop it!

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.064
Chenault!

01:21:58.707 --> 01:22:00.667
Chenault, come here! Chenault!

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:04.004
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.803
You want to fuck with me?

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:14.723
You know who I am?

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:16.224
You motherfucker!

01:22:16.308 --> 01:22:18.184
You know who I am?

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.481
- You're a dead man!
- Go! Go!

01:22:23.565 --> 01:22:24.858
Get your hands off me.

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:26.359
- You're a dead man!
- Go!

01:22:26.693 --> 01:22:28.069
Forget it.

01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:31.698
- We'll call you a cab.
- Fuck off!

01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:37.787
I gotta get the girl.

01:22:38.038 --> 01:22:40.373
She's having a good time. We closed.

01:22:43.293 --> 01:22:44.628
You deaf?

01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.379
I said we closed.

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:47.964
No way, Paul.

01:22:48.423 --> 01:22:49.674
No way.

01:23:20.914 --> 01:23:22.666
I looked everywhere.

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:25.251
I went to the gendarme.

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:27.170
And?

01:23:28.338 --> 01:23:29.839
We went up there.

01:23:29.923 --> 01:23:31.758
Nothing. Nobody there.

01:23:33.885 --> 01:23:35.970
But an old woman with a mop.

01:23:38.264 --> 01:23:40.767
She was more help than the cops were.

01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:44.354
"What can I do if your girlfriend
likes someone else?" he said.

01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:47.273
He's right about that, Paul.

01:23:48.983 --> 01:23:50.902
She's not your girlfriend.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.958
Maybe she went back to the boat.

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.297
Did you try the boat?

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:12.966
No.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.720
I don't think he'd let her back on.

01:24:31.735 --> 01:24:33.027
Is she with you?

01:24:35.989 --> 01:24:37.115
Is she with you?

01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:40.994
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.497
I want the keys.

01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:46.791
The Chevy.

01:25:05.351 --> 01:25:07.020
You blew it, Kemp.

01:25:31.795 --> 01:25:33.546
It's all rust.

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:40.595
I've seen better tires
hanging over the side of a tug.

01:25:41.221 --> 01:25:42.931
You want it or not?

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.727
Yeah, we want it.

01:25:48.895 --> 01:25:52.106
Everyone turns up
for their Friday check, right?

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:54.400
No check, no Lotterman.

01:25:55.235 --> 01:25:58.738
So I go around to see
that unforgivably ugly wife of his.

01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:01.115
She tells me he's gone to Miami.

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:02.450
For what?

01:26:02.534 --> 01:26:04.661
You don't know, I don't know.

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:07.288
But the scabs are back.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.918
Since Morell went,
the paper took a turn for the worse.

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:15.839
Is there anything in the spinner?

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:17.590
We need a fresh sack.

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:21.386
Well, maybe I can
interest you gentlemen in something else.

01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:23.263
Like what, death?

01:26:23.972 --> 01:26:27.016
Like the most powerful drug
in the history of narcotics.

01:26:29.018 --> 01:26:31.813
I'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.

01:26:31.938 --> 01:26:35.024
All I can tell you is this
stuff is so powerful,

01:26:35.984 --> 01:26:37.193
they give it to Communists.

01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:38.862
Who does?

01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:40.530
The FBI.

01:26:40.947 --> 01:26:43.533
Why would the FBI get Communists high?

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:46.452
That I can't help you with.

01:26:48.162 --> 01:26:50.206
You take it like eye drops.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:54.043
In the eye?

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:55.753
So I understand.

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:58.548
It makes the eye see things.

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:00.258
You see a different reality.

01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:02.510
What do you want for it?

01:27:02.594 --> 01:27:05.805
I'll throw it in
with the bike if you do me a favor.

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:07.807
What's the favor?

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:12.520
I want you to come to the bathroom with me.

01:27:14.522 --> 01:27:15.940
He's your man.

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:17.984
- $50, right?
- Yeah.

01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:35.293
He wants me to look at his dick.

01:27:35.376 --> 01:27:37.003
I flatly refused.

01:27:37.337 --> 01:27:39.005
What does he want you to look at it for?

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:40.423
Says there's something wrong with it.

01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:41.674
It's a gentleman's matter.

01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:42.926
I'm not looking at it!

01:27:43.009 --> 01:27:44.302
All right, give me the drugs back.

01:27:44.385 --> 01:27:45.678
No! Wait.

01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:47.931
I'll look at it.

01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:55.021
I'll view it in the mirror.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.667
Is it clap?

01:28:18.002 --> 01:28:19.712
A standing ovation.

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:49.993
You see anything?

01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.494
No.

01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.832
Neither do I.

01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:17.020
We'll give it another five minutes.

01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:19.897
<i>Trouble making ends meet?</i>

01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:22.275
<i>- Then, you need the Lending Man.
- Right.</i>

01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:31.325
<i>Call the Lending Man now.</i>

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.348
How long since we took it?

01:29:57.894 --> 01:29:59.479
I don't know.

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:02.940
Awhile.

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:12.658
Bullshit, isn't it?

01:30:14.327 --> 01:30:15.828
Is it bullshit?

01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:43.666
Jesus.

01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:47.670
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.

01:31:54.427 --> 01:31:56.304
For Christ's sake, keep it out.

01:31:56.387 --> 01:31:57.555
What are you talking about?

01:31:57.638 --> 01:31:59.182
Your tongue belongs to Satan!

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:00.474
Are you out of your mind?

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.143
Keep it out!

01:32:03.436 --> 01:32:05.354
If it goes back into your
mouth, it'll kill you.

01:32:07.315 --> 01:32:08.566
We've got to get it into the sink!

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:12.195
You're giving me fear.

01:32:12.278 --> 01:32:13.696
Stop it! I've got fear!

01:32:13.779 --> 01:32:15.323
Fuck you. So do I.

01:32:15.406 --> 01:32:16.616
You're high, you fool.

01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:17.992
Drink some rum.

01:32:39.805 --> 01:32:42.350
I thought I was losing grip in there.

01:32:44.644 --> 01:32:45.728
What did we take?

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:47.313
I don't know.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:51.692
We need to get some more.

01:33:04.038 --> 01:33:05.122
That explains it.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.335
Doesn't it?

01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:11.295
Explains what?

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:15.383
The world.

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:19.178
And us.

01:33:25.351 --> 01:33:29.480
<i>I wonder what it is you might think
about our different worlds.</i>

01:33:31.691 --> 01:33:34.485
<i>He looked at me kind
of sideways and said,</i>

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:38.531
<i>"Human beings
are the only creatures on Earth</i>

01:33:39.448 --> 01:33:41.117
<i>"that claim a God.</i>

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:46.289
<i>"And the only living thing
that behaves like it hasn't got one.</i>

01:33:48.207 --> 01:33:51.002
<i>"Does the world belong
to no one but you?"</i>

01:33:53.337 --> 01:33:56.048
<i>And when he said it,
I was taken aback.</i>

01:33:58.092 --> 01:34:00.845
<i>Not because of who was
doing the talking,</i>

01:34:01.095 --> 01:34:03.806
<i>because I finally
understood the connection</i>

01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:06.392
<i>between children scavenging for food</i>

01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:10.688
<i>and shiny brass plates
on the front doors of banks.</i>

01:34:12.606 --> 01:34:13.941
Gotta go.

01:34:42.303 --> 01:34:43.804
Come in.

01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.681
Come in.

01:34:49.935 --> 01:34:51.604
We gotta go.

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:53.981
Give me a minute.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.779
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

01:35:11.957 --> 01:35:14.210
How nice of you to drop in.

01:35:14.293 --> 01:35:15.711
I was covering the carnival.

01:35:15.795 --> 01:35:17.129
That's not what I heard.

01:35:17.213 --> 01:35:19.382
I heard you were
in the moonlight for Sanderson.

01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:20.508
I was what?

01:35:20.591 --> 01:35:21.967
Moonlighting for Sanderson.

01:35:22.051 --> 01:35:23.052
Where's Segurra?

01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:24.470
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.

01:35:24.553 --> 01:35:25.554
I got a story for you.

01:35:25.638 --> 01:35:28.391
Yeah, you may have noticed
that I'm somewhat busy.

01:35:28.474 --> 01:35:32.311
This is real important, involving
Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

01:35:32.395 --> 01:35:33.896
I'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.

01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:36.816
I got 21 jobs on the line
and a newspaper going under.

01:35:36.899 --> 01:35:38.401
Print this, and you'll sell it.

01:35:38.484 --> 01:35:39.902
A planning scam.

01:35:39.985 --> 01:35:42.029
Literally despoliation of a paradise.

01:35:42.113 --> 01:35:44.365
A thousand people
will be swept into the sea like garbage.

01:35:44.657 --> 01:35:45.908
You are weird, Kemp.

01:35:45.991 --> 01:35:48.202
It's not what it's doing
to them, it's what it's doing to you.

01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:49.745
It's called journalism.

01:35:49.829 --> 01:35:51.205
Make me laugh.

01:35:51.664 --> 01:35:53.082
I asked you to tidy up the booze,

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:54.792
you couldn't even sweep out a room.

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:56.127
Why do you think you're working here?

01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:59.338
'Cause you're everything
that's wrong with a journalist.

01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:01.841
And you're everything that's wrong
with this insult of a newspaper.

01:36:01.924 --> 01:36:03.676
Unanimously agreed.

01:36:03.968 --> 01:36:05.845
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?

01:36:06.387 --> 01:36:08.681
You are a waste of human sperm.

01:36:10.683 --> 01:36:14.812
Die a prolonged and
relentlessly agonizing death!

01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:31.370
Enjoy her.

01:36:56.937 --> 01:36:58.606
Made you some tea.

01:37:05.571 --> 01:37:07.573
You should try and sleep.

01:37:08.073 --> 01:37:09.700
I stole your bed.

01:37:10.409 --> 01:37:12.161
It's okay.

01:37:12.578 --> 01:37:14.330
I'm going to write.

01:37:19.502 --> 01:37:20.961
I'm so sorry.

01:37:22.588 --> 01:37:24.089
Don't be sorry.

01:37:27.593 --> 01:37:30.095
You did me the best favor I ever had.

01:37:35.184 --> 01:37:37.269
There is no dream, Chenault.

01:37:39.438 --> 01:37:41.524
Just a piss puddle of greed,

01:37:42.816 --> 01:37:45.069
spreading throughout the world.

01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:53.327
<i>I want to make a promise
to you, the reader.</i>

01:37:54.245 --> 01:37:56.830
<i>And I don't know if I can
fulfill it tomorrow</i>

01:37:56.914 --> 01:37:58.999
<i>or even the day after that.</i>

01:37:59.625 --> 01:38:02.670
<i>But I put the bastards of
this world on notice.</i>

01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:07.091
<i>That I do not have their
best interests at heart.</i>

01:38:08.884 --> 01:38:11.303
<i>I will try and speak for my reader.</i>

01:38:12.263 --> 01:38:13.973
<i>That is my promise.</i>

01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:19.103
<i>And it will be a voice
made of ink and rage.</i>

01:38:22.356 --> 01:38:24.066
Sit down. I made you coffee.

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:25.484
Thanks.

01:38:28.279 --> 01:38:30.447
One for you and one for me.

01:38:33.701 --> 01:38:36.996
Oh, man, I would
rather not start the day with this.

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:39.540
- What is it?
- It's a writ.

01:38:39.623 --> 01:38:41.125
Means we're going to court.

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.627
It means
they can arrest us, should they so desire,

01:38:43.711 --> 01:38:45.588
any damn minute they please.

01:38:45.671 --> 01:38:47.256
We need to speak to a lawyer.

01:38:47.339 --> 01:38:49.133
We don't even have a phone.

01:38:49.216 --> 01:38:50.843
I know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.428
Kind of owes me one.

01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:53.971
You should get dressed.
We'll go down there.

01:38:54.054 --> 01:38:56.515
Water ran out. I'm covered in soap.

01:38:56.765 --> 01:38:58.517
Fuck it. See what I can do.

01:39:00.603 --> 01:39:02.104
What's it for?

01:39:03.856 --> 01:39:05.232
It's Hal.

01:39:07.359 --> 01:39:10.321
He put up a bond for us
on this thing, and now he's pulled it.

01:39:10.404 --> 01:39:11.530
Here.

01:39:17.411 --> 01:39:19.538
You know he's a crook, Paul.

01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:22.333
And we get the writs.

01:40:59.096 --> 01:41:00.472
What is it?

01:41:00.973 --> 01:41:03.225
It's Hitler.

01:41:12.526 --> 01:41:13.861
It's over.

01:41:14.153 --> 01:41:15.154
What is?

01:41:16.572 --> 01:41:18.240
They shut us down.

01:41:19.491 --> 01:41:21.618
He just stood there and lied to us.

01:41:21.702 --> 01:41:24.413
He hasn't got the morality
of a clapped out cash register.

01:41:24.496 --> 01:41:28.083
I hate to tell you this, guys,
but it was to avoid severance.

01:41:28.167 --> 01:41:29.918
We all know what it was for, Charlie.

01:41:30.002 --> 01:41:31.754
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

01:41:31.837 --> 01:41:34.798
There's nothing we can do,
except report him to the labor board,

01:41:34.882 --> 01:41:36.550
which is the same thing as doing nothing.

01:41:36.633 --> 01:41:38.010
I disagree.

01:41:38.135 --> 01:41:39.887
We gotta strike back

01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:42.681
and nail this bastard
to his own front door.

01:41:42.765 --> 01:41:44.433
And how, pray, do we do that?

01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:46.393
By printing the paper

01:41:46.977 --> 01:41:48.979
We got tons of stuff on Lotterman.

01:41:49.062 --> 01:41:52.024
Every happy maggot with
his hand in the till.

01:41:52.524 --> 01:41:56.612
It may be the last-ever issue,
but we go out in a blaze of rage.

01:41:56.695 --> 01:41:59.823
What are you talking about?
It costs $2,200 a shot.

01:42:00.032 --> 01:42:01.074
We bring in the scabs.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.284
They're picketing for money.

01:42:02.743 --> 01:42:03.911
You're through the looking glass.

01:42:04.036 --> 01:42:06.538
We haven't even
got enough money for drinks.

01:42:07.873 --> 01:42:11.043
It's not worth the fight. This has been
coming down the pike for a long time.

01:42:11.126 --> 01:42:12.628
You got to know it's over when it's over.

01:42:13.003 --> 01:42:16.507
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing
but a wrapping for fish heads.

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:17.633
Plus, it's a lockout.

01:42:17.716 --> 01:42:19.218
Fuck the locks.

01:42:20.093 --> 01:42:21.970
I say we just walk in.

01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:26.058
Anybody with me?

01:42:29.228 --> 01:42:30.312
Bob?

01:42:31.688 --> 01:42:33.565
You know I'm with you.

01:42:38.111 --> 01:42:40.239
We didn't pay the bill.

01:42:44.409 --> 01:42:45.911
Where's Chenault?

01:42:59.299 --> 01:43:01.218
She's gone to New York.

01:43:02.636 --> 01:43:04.263
She left me $100.

01:43:05.055 --> 01:43:06.765
I don't believe it.

01:43:07.558 --> 01:43:09.309
She didn't have any money.

01:43:09.393 --> 01:43:11.311
You should use it to go with her.

01:43:11.395 --> 01:43:13.105
Red-eye for 50 bucks.

01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:14.273
No.

01:43:15.232 --> 01:43:17.109
I'm not going anywhere.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.655
By some means or
another, I'm gonna put the paper out.

01:43:21.738 --> 01:43:23.699
Print the bastard, then we're gone.

01:43:23.782 --> 01:43:25.701
Face the reality, Paul.

01:43:25.951 --> 01:43:27.995
There's no job, no money, no girl,

01:43:28.078 --> 01:43:29.872
and a warrant out for our arrest.

01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:31.164
There's no contest.

01:43:31.248 --> 01:43:33.041
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.

01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:34.376
I'm not Donovan!

01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:36.795
And I'm not like the others.

01:43:37.296 --> 01:43:39.506
I'm telling you right now,
next time some greasy moron

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:42.467
starts bullshitting me,
I'm going after him.

01:43:44.303 --> 01:43:46.805
All the way up
to the president of the United States.

01:43:48.682 --> 01:43:49.808
I just want to win one once.

01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:51.810
One sheet.

01:43:51.894 --> 01:43:54.187
You ain't gonna get far on $100.

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:57.024
Some of the scabs will do it for nothing.

01:43:57.107 --> 01:43:59.902
We're gonna need 20 guys, plus vans.

01:43:59.985 --> 01:44:02.404
No, no, all you need is two grand.

01:44:04.615 --> 01:44:06.241
We're out of rum.

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:13.165
It's as if God, in a fit of disgust,

01:44:13.582 --> 01:44:15.834
has decided to wipe us all out.

01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:26.178
Yea, the cock crows thrice.

01:44:32.267 --> 01:44:34.186
What about El Monstruo?

01:44:36.813 --> 01:44:38.899
Bet the $100 on El Monstruo.

01:45:00.003 --> 01:45:01.546
How do you know he lives here?

01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:03.131
I saw him come out.

01:45:03.215 --> 01:45:05.717
You better let me do this on my own.

01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:12.641
If he gets it, we should
bring it to Papa Nebo.

01:45:13.058 --> 01:45:14.184
Who's that?

01:45:14.559 --> 01:45:15.727
My witch doctor.

01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:18.063
She's a hermaphrodite.

01:45:20.482 --> 01:45:22.609
Stop here! Stop here!

01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:28.281
By day, she drives a garbage truck.

01:45:29.741 --> 01:45:32.369
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo,

01:45:33.412 --> 01:45:36.081
the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead.

01:45:37.374 --> 01:45:40.460
When permission
is granted from Papa Samedi,

01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:43.547
the keeper of the cemetery,

01:45:43.714 --> 01:45:45.173
she'll visit,

01:45:45.298 --> 01:45:47.384
and she'll dig up a corpse.

01:45:48.010 --> 01:45:50.929
Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs

01:45:51.263 --> 01:45:55.684
are indispensable for use in ouangas.

01:46:16.496 --> 01:46:18.498
This is horseshit, isn't it?

01:46:18.582 --> 01:46:20.292
She cured my prick.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.599
She wants to know what you want.

01:46:38.143 --> 01:46:40.771
We want her to empower this fowl.

01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:43.398
We want it blessed

01:46:43.899 --> 01:46:47.778
and anything that tries to fight it, dead.

01:46:52.616 --> 01:46:54.409
Bring forth the fowl.

01:47:38.995 --> 01:47:42.207
She says that no fowl on Earth

01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:45.043
could challenge this cockerel and survive.

01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.253
Great.

01:47:46.336 --> 01:47:47.379
How's she off for curses?

01:47:48.505 --> 01:47:50.257
Pretty good.

01:47:50.674 --> 01:47:53.677
Let's have a curse on Sanderson.
Make his dick fall off.

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.178
And that fucker at the bank, Green.

01:47:55.554 --> 01:47:56.847
Mr. Green.

01:48:11.319 --> 01:48:12.404
Jesus!

01:48:12.529 --> 01:48:13.780
Curse active!

01:48:32.924 --> 01:48:34.134
Okay, come on.

01:49:09.586 --> 01:49:10.670
One down, two to go.

01:49:10.754 --> 01:49:12.214
Okay. I'm gonna call Moburg.

01:49:12.297 --> 01:49:13.423
Okay.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.767
Come on. Come on.

01:49:37.155 --> 01:49:38.698
He isn't there.

01:49:41.534 --> 01:49:42.994
He has to be.

01:49:44.829 --> 01:49:46.373
He isn't there.

01:50:06.726 --> 01:50:08.061
<i>- Where have you been?
- Sorry.</i>

01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:09.896
I never heard the phone.

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:11.022
How's it going?

01:50:11.690 --> 01:50:13.483
Winning, man. We're winning.

01:50:13.566 --> 01:50:16.111
Is everyone there? ls everyone there?

01:50:17.362 --> 01:50:19.197
Yeah, everyone's here.

01:50:19.322 --> 01:50:20.991
<i>What about the vans?</i>

01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:23.451
What about the vans, Moburg?

01:50:24.077 --> 01:50:26.079
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, vans.

01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:30.583
You hear that?

01:50:30.875 --> 01:50:32.294
We're on our way.

01:50:53.732 --> 01:50:55.400
What the hell is going on?

01:50:57.193 --> 01:50:59.070
He said he had the men.

01:51:03.241 --> 01:51:05.452
"All claims against
the former owners will be..."

01:51:07.078 --> 01:51:10.165
"Signed on behalf
of First Maritime Bank, Miami."

01:51:10.248 --> 01:51:12.375
Sanderson's pal, Mr. Green.

01:51:16.171 --> 01:51:17.589
Sorry, Paul.

01:51:18.965 --> 01:51:20.300
I didn't know how to say.

01:51:22.761 --> 01:51:26.014
They took all the machines out.

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.393
Not everything,
but just the parts that matter.

01:51:33.646 --> 01:51:35.273
I'll let you in.

01:52:09.224 --> 01:52:11.476
All I wanted was a front page.

01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:14.270
Probably for the best.

01:52:14.354 --> 01:52:16.981
Probably would've never pulled it off.

01:52:20.318 --> 01:52:22.946
How much did you guys win?

01:52:23.113 --> 01:52:24.906
Just under six grand.

01:52:25.615 --> 01:52:27.492
Oh, yeah, well, you...

01:52:27.575 --> 01:52:29.619
At least you can pay off the bond now.

01:52:29.702 --> 01:52:31.246
Screw the bond.

01:52:32.622 --> 01:52:34.290
We're out of here.

01:52:36.084 --> 01:52:37.210
It's over with.

01:52:37.293 --> 01:52:39.087
There's a midnight Pan Am.

01:52:39.170 --> 01:52:41.297
I'm not risking the airport.

01:52:44.175 --> 01:52:45.260
No.

01:52:47.679 --> 01:52:49.597
I figure this island owes us a boat.

01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:53.935
And I'm fuckin' taking one of Sanderson's.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.940
You smell it?

01:53:03.778 --> 01:53:05.822
It's the smell of bastards.

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.327
It's also the smell of truth.

01:53:15.039 --> 01:53:16.416
I smell ink.

01:53:50.283 --> 01:53:52.410
I got to take the hen back.

01:54:06.299 --> 01:54:08.426
Find yourself a trade wind.

01:54:09.305 --> 01:54:15.496
