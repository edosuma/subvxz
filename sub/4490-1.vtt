20:02.335 --> 20:05.305
WOULD YOU CARE
TO MAKE A STATEMENT?

20:05.338 --> 20:07.640
WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS

20:07.674 --> 20:10.643
IS A RETURN TO
SWEETNESS AND DECENCY

20:10.677 --> 20:13.813
IN THE SOULS OF
ITS YOUNG MEN AND...

20:13.846 --> 20:17.284
(GROAN)

20:20.353 --> 20:23.456
YEAH, I, UH, COULDN'T
AGREE WITH YOU MORE,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.824
BUT, UH...

20:24.857 --> 20:26.826
(WHISTLE)

20:35.335 --> 20:38.605
GET YOURSELF SOME COFFEE.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.829
LOOK, YOU TAKE
THE CAB.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.631
MMM...

21:09.536 --> 21:12.672
CLIMB IN THE CAB
AND GO HOME.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.906
MMM...

21:13.940 --> 21:15.342
SO HAPPY.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.344
YOU GOT ANY MONEY?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.811
NEVER CARRY MONEY.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.780
THAT'S A BAD HABIT.

21:20.813 --> 21:24.351
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DROP YOU OFF.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.319
IT'S A TAXI!

21:26.353 --> 21:28.621
WELL, IT'S NOT
THE SUPER CHIEF.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.825
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

21:32.859 --> 21:34.661
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

21:34.694 --> 21:37.364
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.332
HMM? COLISEUM.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.335
NOW, COME ON.
YOU'RE NOT THAT DRUNK.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.804
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE SO SMART.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.806
I'M NOT DRUNK
AT ALL.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.342
I'M JUST BEING
VERY HAPPY.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.812
HEY, NOW, DON'T GO
TO SLEEP AGAIN. COME ON.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.347
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

21:54.381 --> 21:56.115
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.684
UN MOMENTO.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.820
LOOK, NOW, WHERE DO
YOU WANT TO GO?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.922
WHERE SHALL
I TAKE YOU?

22:04.391 --> 22:06.526
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

22:06.559 --> 22:07.694
MMM...

22:07.727 --> 22:10.830
COME ON. COME ON.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.399
OH... I...

22:12.432 --> 22:14.834
COME ON!
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

22:14.867 --> 22:18.438
MMM! OH...
COLISEUM.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.109
SHE LIVES
IN THE COLISEUM.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.579
IS WRONG ADDRESS.
NOW, LOOK, SIGNORE.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.416
FOR ME, IT IS
VERY LATE NIGHT.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.118
I HAVE THREE BAMBINOS,
THREE BAMBINOS.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.821
YOU KNOW, BAMBINO.
UH... WAH!

22:34.854 --> 22:36.589
MY TAXI GO HOME.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.825
I GO HOME, TOO.
TOGETHER.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.627
VIA MARGUTTA 51.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.432
VIA MARGUTTA 51.
OH, MOLTO BENE!

22:57.209 --> 22:59.178
HERE IS VIA MARGUTTA 51.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.147
I AM VERY HAPPY.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.649
(TURNS OFF METER)

23:02.682 --> 23:04.817
1,000 LIRE.
MILA LIRE.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.453
MILA.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.662
CINQUEMILA.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.165
1, 2, 3, 4 MILLE.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.167
OK. MILA PER TE.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.802
FOR ME?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.170
SI.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.838
OH, GRAZIE MILLE.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.674
OK, OK. NOW, LOOK.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.176
TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT...

23:30.209 --> 23:31.678
YEAH?

23:31.711 --> 23:34.814
TAKE HER WHEREVER
SHE WANTS TO GO, HMM?

23:34.847 --> 23:37.183
CAPITO? CAPITO.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.651
BUONA NOTTE.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.853
GOOD NIGHT.
BUONA NOTTE.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.188
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

23:42.221 --> 23:43.590
OH!

23:43.623 --> 23:45.191
MOMENTO,
MOMENTO, MOMENTO.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.193
NO, NO, NO, NO.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.697
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
AS SOON AS SHE WAKES UP,

23:50.730 --> 23:54.133
SHE'LL TELL YOU WHERE
SHE WANTS TO GO. OK?

23:54.166 --> 23:57.169
MOMENTO. MY TAXI
IS NOT FOR SLEEP.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.171
MY TAXI. NO SLEEP.
UNDERSTAND?

23:59.205 --> 24:02.174
LOOK, PAL. THIS IS
NOT MY PROBLEM, SEE?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.176
I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.213
IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
IS NOT MY PROBLEM.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.181
WHAT YOU WANT?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.217
YOU DON'T
WANT GIRL, YES?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.185
ME DON'T WANT GIRL.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.154
POLICE!
MAYBE SHE WANT GIRL.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.190
STA CALMO. STA CALMO.
OK, OK, OK.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.693
VA BENE. VA BENE.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.235
SO HAPPY...

25:03.269 --> 25:06.706
SO HAPPY...

25:27.760 --> 25:31.030
I OUGHT TO HAVE
MY HEAD EXAMINED.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.236
IS THIS
THE ELEVATOR?

25:37.269 --> 25:39.706
IT'S MY ROOM.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.743
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
TO MENTION IT,

25:43.776 --> 25:46.913
BUT THE DIZZINESS
IS GETTING WORSE.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.749
CAN I SLEEP HERE?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.218
THAT'S
THE GENERAL IDEA.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.221
CAN I HAVE
A SILK NIGHTGOWN

25:55.254 --> 25:58.057
WITH ROSEBUDS
ON IT?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.193
I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL HAVE TO

26:01.227 --> 26:03.229
ROUGH IT TONIGHT...
IN THESE.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.731
PAJAMAS!

26:04.764 --> 26:06.733
SORRY, HONEY,
BUT I HAVEN'T

26:06.766 --> 26:09.035
WORN A NIGHTGOWN
IN YEARS.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.906
WILL YOU HELP ME
GET UNDRESSED,

26:13.940 --> 26:15.708
PLEASE?

26:18.945 --> 26:20.312
UH...

26:20.346 --> 26:22.048
OK.

26:32.124 --> 26:37.730
UH... THERE YOU ARE.
YOU CAN HANDLE THE REST.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.043
MAY I HAVE SOME?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.914
NO.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.783
NOW, LOOK...

26:56.816 --> 26:58.751
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL.

26:58.785 --> 27:02.254
I'VE NEVER BEEN ALONE
WITH A MAN BEFORE,

27:02.288 --> 27:04.724
EVEN WITH MY DRESS ON.

27:04.757 --> 27:08.761
WITH MY DRESS OFF,
IT'S MOST UNUSUAL.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.931
HA! I DON'T SEEM
TO MIND.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.066
DO YOU?

27:15.802 --> 27:19.772
I THINK I'LL GO OUT
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.941
YOU'D BETTER
GET TO SLEEP.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.275
MMM...

27:23.309 --> 27:25.277
OH, NO.
ON THIS ONE.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.279
SO TERRIBLY NICE.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.281
HEY. HEY.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.251
THESE ARE PAJAMAS.
THEY'RE TO SLEEP IN.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.286
YOU'RE TO CLIMB
INTO THEM.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.922
YOU UNDERSTAND?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.256
THANK YOU.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.792
AND YOU'RE SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.961
NOT ON THE BED.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.262
IS THAT CLEAR?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.765
DO YOU KNOW
MY FAVORITE POEM?

27:45.798 --> 27:48.134
YOU ALREADY RECITED
THAT FOR ME.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.270
"ARETHUSA ROSE
FROM HER COUCH OF SNOWS

27:51.303 --> 27:53.940
IN THE ACROCERAUNIAN
MOUNTAINS."

27:53.973 --> 27:55.307
KEATS.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.776
SHELLEY.

27:56.809 --> 28:00.312
KEEP YOUR MIND
OFF POETRY
AND ON THE PAJAMAS.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.781
KEATS.

28:01.814 --> 28:05.051
SHELLEY.
I'LL BE BACK
IN 1O MINUTES.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.086
KEATS.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.797
YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION
TO WITHDRAW.

28:17.830 --> 28:21.100
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.276
WELL, NO TRACE,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.278
HAVE YOU SEARCHED
THE GROUNDS?

28:32.311 --> 28:34.814
FROM THE ATTICS
TO THE CELLAR.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.050
YOU MUST NOT SPEAK
OF THIS TO ANYONE.

28:38.084 --> 28:41.821
THE PRINCESS
IS THE DIRECT HEIR
TO THE THRONE.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.823
THIS MUST BE
TOP CRISIS SECRET.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.092
HAVE I YOUR PLEDGE?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.293
YES, SIR.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.795
VERY WELL.

28:48.828 --> 28:54.100
NOW WE MUST NOTIFY
THEIR MAJESTIES.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.985
UH...

29:13.019 --> 29:14.787
OHH...

29:23.896 --> 29:25.798
(DOOR SLAMS)

29:34.306 --> 29:37.910
(SCRAPES
AGAINST FLOOR)

30:12.011 --> 30:13.812
UMM.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.615
SO HAPPY.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.952
THE PLEASURE'S MINE.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.124
AH, SCREWBALL.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.845
(STRIKING THE HOUR)

31:10.669 --> 31:13.039
HOLY SMOKE.
THE PRINCESS INTERVIEW.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.340
HMM?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.342
11:45.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.676
AHH.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.478
AH, SHH.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.690
HI, JOE.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.358
GOOD MORNING, JOE.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.194
HELLO, HONEY.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.200
MR. HENNESSY
HAS BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.169
UH-OH.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.173
THANKS A LOT, HON.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.176
COME IN!

32:30.216 --> 32:32.351
YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR ME?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.186
JUST COMING TO WORK?

32:34.220 --> 32:36.688
WE START OUR DAYS
AT 8:3O.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.690
WE PICK UP
OUR ASSIGNMENTS...

32:38.724 --> 32:41.193
I PICKED MINE UP
LAST NIGHT.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.362
WHAT ASSIGNMENT
WAS THAT?

32:43.395 --> 32:45.131
THE PRINCESS. 11:45.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.602
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
TO THE INTERVIEW?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.271
SURE. I JUST GOT BACK.

32:52.304 --> 32:57.343
WELL, WELL, WELL,
ALL MY APOLOGIES.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.677
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.512
THIS IS
VERY INTERESTING.

33:00.546 --> 33:04.216
DID SHE ANSWER
ALL THE QUESTIONS
ON THE LIST?

33:04.250 --> 33:06.718
OF COURSE. I'VE
GOT THEM SOMEWHERE.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.521
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF.
I HAVE A COPY HERE.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.225
HOW DID
HER HIGHNESS REACT TO
A EUROPEAN FEDERATION?

33:13.259 --> 33:15.661
SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST FINE.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.097
SHE DID?

33:18.130 --> 33:21.367
WELL, SHE THOUGHT
THAT THERE WOULD BE

33:21.400 --> 33:22.701
TWO EFFECTS...

33:22.734 --> 33:24.736
THE DIRECT
AND THE INDIRECT.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.238
REMARKABLE.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.707
NATURALLY, SHE THOUGHT
THAT THE INDIRECT

33:28.740 --> 33:33.245
WOULD NOT BE AS DIRECT...
AS THE DIRECT.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.381
THAT IS,
NOT RIGHT AWAY.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.249
NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.385
LATER ON, OF COURSE,
WELL...

33:39.418 --> 33:40.719
NOBODY KNOWS.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.221
WELL, WELL, WELL.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.223
THAT WAS A SHREWD
OBSERVATION.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.392
THEY FOOL YOU,
YOU KNOW,

33:46.425 --> 33:47.693
THESE ROYAL KIDS.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.695
THEY'VE GOT
A LOT MORE

33:49.728 --> 33:51.230
ON THE BALL
THAN WE SUSPECT.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.232
HOW DID
SHE FEEL ABOUT

33:53.265 --> 33:56.435
THE FUTURE FRIENDSHIP
OF NATIONS?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.704
YOUTH.

33:58.737 --> 34:02.241
SHE FELT THAT
THE YOUTH OF THE WORLD

34:02.274 --> 34:08.414
MUST LEAD THE WAY TO
A BETTER... WORLD.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.715
ORIGINAL.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.252
UH, BY THE WAY,
WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?

34:13.284 --> 34:16.255
OH, YOU MEAN,
WHAT DID SHE HAVE ON?

34:16.288 --> 34:18.556
WELL, THAT'S USUALLY
WHAT IT MEANS.

34:18.590 --> 34:22.228
WHAT'S WRONG?
IS IT A LITTLE
WARM IN HERE?

34:22.261 --> 34:24.563
NO. I JUST
HURRIED OVER HERE.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.699
NATURALLY,
WITH A STORY
OF THESE DIMENSIONS.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.735
DID YOU SAY SHE
WAS WEARING GRAY?

34:30.768 --> 34:32.704
SHE USUALLY WEARS GRAY.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.706
WELL, IT WAS A KIND
OF A GRAY.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.710
I THINK I KNOW
THE DRESS YOU MEAN.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.746
IT HAS
A GOLD COLLAR.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.313
THAT'S THE ONE.

34:42.348 --> 34:45.251
I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT
VERY WELL...

34:45.284 --> 34:48.254
IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT HER HIGHNESS

34:48.286 --> 34:50.656
WAS TAKEN VIOLENTLY
ILL AT 3 A.M.,

34:50.688 --> 34:53.259
PUT TO BED
WITH A FEVER,

34:53.292 --> 34:56.262
AND HAS HAD ALL HER
APPOINTMENTS FOR TODAY

34:56.295 --> 34:57.729
CANCELED IN TOTO!

34:57.763 --> 34:59.331
IN... TOTO?

34:59.365 --> 35:03.469
YES, MR. BRADLEY,
IN TOTO.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.736
(GULP)

35:04.770 --> 35:07.239
IT'S CERTAINLY
PRETTY HARD TO SWALLOW.

35:07.273 --> 35:11.243
IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT YOU JUST LEFT HER.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.745
IT'S ALL OVER
THE FRONT PAGE

35:13.779 --> 35:15.614
OF EVERY NEWSPAPER
IN ROME.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.750
OK, I OVERSLEPT.
IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.320
IF YOU READ
A MORNING PAPER,

35:21.353 --> 35:23.355
YOU MIGHT DISCOVER
LITTLE ITEMS

35:23.389 --> 35:26.392
THAT MIGHT
PREVENT YOU FROM
GETTING IMMERSED

35:26.425 --> 35:29.761
IN SUCH
A GOLD-PLATED,
STAR-SPANGLED LIE

35:29.795 --> 35:31.597
AS YOU HAVE
JUST TOLD.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.267
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D TRY SOME
OTHER BUSINESS...

35:35.301 --> 35:36.768
LIKE
MATTRESS TESTING.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.637
IS THIS THE PRINCESS?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.173
YES, THAT IS
THE PRINCESS.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.774
IT ISN'T
ANNIE OAKLEY

35:42.808 --> 35:44.776
OR MADAME
CHIANG KAI-SHEK.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.578
TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.781
YOU MIGHT
BE INTERVIEWING HER
AGAIN SOMEDAY.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.250
AM I FIRED?

35:51.283 --> 35:54.253
NO. WHEN I WANT
TO FIRE YOU,

35:54.286 --> 35:57.323
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO ASK... YOU'LL KNOW!

36:00.492 --> 36:02.561
THE MAN'S MAD.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.416
(RING)

36:24.450 --> 36:25.684
PRONTO.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.786
GIOVANNI, IT'S JOE BRADLEY.

36:27.819 --> 36:31.290
I WANT YOU TO HURRY
UP TO MY PLACE

36:31.323 --> 36:34.926
AND SEE IF THERE'S
SOMEBODY THERE ASLEEP.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.297
AHA. SURE, MR. JOE.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.299
I LOOK SUBITO.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.269
YOU WAIT. ASPETTA.

37:02.488 --> 37:03.855
MR. JOE?

37:03.889 --> 37:06.292
YEAH! TELL ME. TELL ME.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.427
BELLISSIMA!

37:09.661 --> 37:13.265
GIOVANNI, I LOVE YOU.
NOW, LISTEN.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.267
YES, MR. JOE?

37:16.835 --> 37:18.470
A GUN?

37:18.504 --> 37:19.605
NO!

37:19.638 --> 37:22.308
YES, A GUN, A KNIFE,
ANYTHING...

37:22.341 --> 37:25.311
BUT NOBODY GOES IN,
AND NOBODY GOES OUT.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.912
CAPITO?

37:26.945 --> 37:28.614
OK.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.329
YOU STILL HERE?

37:43.362 --> 37:45.831
HOW MUCH WOULD
A REAL INTERVIEW

37:45.864 --> 37:47.633
WITH THIS DAME BE WORTH?

37:47.666 --> 37:50.068
ARE YOU REFERRING
TO HER HIGHNESS?

37:50.101 --> 37:53.305
I'M NOT REFERRING
TO ANNIE OAKLEY.
HOW MUCH?

37:53.339 --> 37:56.342
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU GOT NO CHANCE.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.943
BUT IF I DID?

37:57.976 --> 38:02.080
A PLAIN TALK
ON WORLD CONDITIONS
MIGHT BE WORTH $25O.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.651
HER VIEWS ON CLOTHES
WOULD BE WORTH
MORE... 1,000.

38:05.684 --> 38:06.552
DOLLARS?

38:06.585 --> 38:09.821
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HER VIEWS ON EVERYTHING.

38:09.855 --> 38:10.789
HUH?

38:10.822 --> 38:14.360

LONGINGS OF A PRINCESS.

38:18.364 --> 38:23.735
IN A PRIVATE...
PERSONAL... EXCLUSIVE...

38:23.769 --> 38:26.304
INTERVIEW.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.810
CAN'T USE IT, HUH?

38:31.843 --> 38:34.713
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D LIKE IT.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.918
COME HERE.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.822
LOVE ANGLE, TOO,
I SUPPOSE?

38:43.855 --> 38:45.824
PRACTICALLY ALL
LOVE ANGLE.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.359
WITH PICTURES.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.127
COULD BE. HOW MUCH?

38:49.160 --> 38:52.364
THAT PARTICULAR STORY
WILL BE WORTH FIVE GRAND

38:52.398 --> 38:54.132

38:54.165 --> 38:56.702

JUST HOW YOU ARE
GOING TO OBTAIN

38:59.871 --> 39:01.373
THIS FANTASTIC
INTERVIEW.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.142
I'LL ENTER HER SICKROOM
DISGUISED AS A THERMOMETER.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.646
I WANT YOU TO SHAKE
ON FIVE GRAND.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.818
AND YOU REALIZE
HER HIGHNESS LEAVES
FOR ATHENS TOMORROW?

39:12.851 --> 39:13.785
YEP.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.656
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A LITTLE SIDE BET
WITH YOU.

39:17.689 --> 39:21.627
5OO SAYS YOU DON'T
COME UP WITH THE STORY.

39:26.164 --> 39:29.134
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT THAT FOR?

39:29.167 --> 39:31.903
I'M SEEING
WHAT DAY IT IS.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.138
IT'S A DEAL!

39:33.171 --> 39:35.974

LOSE THIS BET,

39:44.215 --> 39:46.151
YOU'LL OWE ME A THOUSAND.

39:46.184 --> 39:49.154
WHY, YOU POOR SUCKER,
I'LL PRACTICALLY OWN YOU.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.156
YOU HAVE
PRACTICALLY OWNED ME.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.159
I'M GOING TO WIN
THAT MONEY, THOUGH,

39:54.192 --> 39:58.163
AND BUY A ONE-WAY TICKET
BACK TO NEW YORK.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.031
I LOVE TO HEAR
YOU WHINE.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.668
WHEN I'M BACK
IN A REAL NEWS ROOM,

40:02.701 --> 40:04.670
I'LL ENJOY
THINKING ABOUT YOU

40:04.703 --> 40:07.072
WITH AN EMPTY LEASH
IN YOUR HANDS

40:07.105 --> 40:09.841
AND NOBODY TO TWITCH

45:07.338 --> 45:10.175
HE WAS SO MEAN TO ME.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.244

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:04.314
DON'T DO THAT, IRVING.
SIT DOWN. JOIN US.

01:08:04.348 --> 01:08:06.150

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.559
WHAT IS A RINGER?

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.261
OH, WAITER?

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.462
IT'S AN AMERICAN TERM,

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:21.265
AND IT MEANS, UH,

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:24.468
ANYONE WHO HAS
A GREAT DEAL OF CHARM.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:25.868

I'D LIKE TO HAVE
HEARD THAT.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.386
WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:44.888
THE SAME AS JOE,
ONLY I'M...

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.390
OH!

I'M AWFULLY SORRY,

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:50.560
WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU...

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:51.895
I'M SORRY.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:55.899
I CAN TAKE A HINT.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.901
YOUR DRINK'S JUST HERE.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.569
TAKE IT EASY.

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:01.371
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.907
SIT DOWN.
THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.276
THAT'S THE BOY.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:08.377
YOU'RE TW...

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.880
YOU'RE TWISTING
MY ARM, YOU KNOW.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:14.384
JUST BE A LITTLE
MORE CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.553
WHO'S BEEN DOING
THE SPILLING?

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:17.654
YOU.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:18.787

WHERE DID YOU FIND
THIS LOONY?

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.564
YOU'RE OK.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.399
HERE'S TO YOU, HUH?

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:31.401
HERE'S HOPING
FOR THE BEST.

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.937
IF IT WASN'T FOR
THAT HAIR,

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.406
I'D SWEAR THAT...

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.707
AAH!

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:38.942
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:41.278
THANKS.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.912
YOU SLIPPED
AND ALMOST
HURT YOURSELF.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.582
I SLIPPED?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.917
I ALMOST HURT MYSELF?

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.886
JOE, I DIDN'T SLIP!

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.888
YOU'VE GOT
A BAD SPRAIN.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.891
WE'D BETTER GO
AND GET IT FIXED UP.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.926
EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.428
I'M SO SORRY.

01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:00.430
JOE, NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

01:10:00.464 --> 01:10:02.899
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.901
HAVE YOU GOT
YOUR LIGHTER?

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.737
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO?

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.940
LISTEN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
FOR FIVE GRAND?

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:12.409
FIVE GRAND?

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:16.446
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO I AM
OR WHAT I DO.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.583
THIS IS MY STORY.
I DUG IT UP.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:20.917

ARE YOU BUYING
THE CROWN JEWELS?

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.908
SHE'S DRINKING
CHAMPAGNE THAT
I CAN'T PAY FOR.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.910
WE'VE GOT TO
ENTERTAIN HER.

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.946
WE CAN'T RUN AROUND TOWN
WITH A PRINCESS.

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:52.749
DO YOU WANT IN OR NOT?

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.923
THIS I WANT BACK SATURDAY.

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:01.958
OK. NOW WHERE'S
YOUR LIGHTER?

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:05.261
LET'S GO TO WORK.

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:13.937
BETTER NOW?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.605
HUH?

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:16.906

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.909
MY EAR? OH, YEAH.
JOE FIXED IT.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.612
WOULD YOU CARE FOR
A CIGARETTE?

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:23.613
YES, PLEASE.

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:27.617
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS,
BUT IT'S MY VERY FIRST.

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:28.952
YOUR VERY FIRST?

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.454

THE GISMO WORKS.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.603
WELL, WHAT'S
THE VERDICT?

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.937
UH, OK?

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.439
NOTHING TO IT.

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:51.475
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOTHING TO IT.

OH, NOT THAT WORD,
PLEASE.

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:13.963
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN
A WORK... SCHOOL SCHEDULE.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:16.466
I MEANT A FUN SCHEDULE.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.468

01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:21.471

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:24.107

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.502
LOOK AT THOSE MEN!

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:28.505
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
INCONSPICUOUS.

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:31.475

THE MOUTH OF TRUTH.

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.942
THE LEGEND IS THAT IF YOU'RE
GIVEN TO LYING

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:36.946
AND PUT YOUR HAND IN THERE,
IT'LL BE BITTEN OFF.

WELL, EACH ONE REPRESENTS
A WISH FULFILLED.

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:28.958
IT STARTED DURING THE WAR
WHEN THERE WAS AN AIR RAID.

01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:33.462
A MAN WITH HIS FOUR CHILDREN
WAS CAUGHT IN THE STREET.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:35.999
THEY RAN OVER
AGAINST THE WALL

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:37.967
AND PRAYED FOR SAFETY.

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:41.337
BOMBS FELL VERY CLOSE,
BUT NO ONE WAS HURT.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.975
THE MAN RETURNED AND PUT UP
THE FIRST OF THESE TABLETS.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:48.277
IT'S BECOME
SORT OF A SHRINE.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:51.447

AND WHENEVER THEIR
WISHES ARE GRANTED,

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.482
THEY PUT UP
ANOTHER PLAQUE.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:55.251
LOVELY STORY.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:21:00.389

OF THE INSCRIPTIONS.

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:16.906
Joe:
MAKE A WISH?

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.342
TELL THE DOCTOR?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:23.012
ANYWAY, THE CHANCES OF IT
BEING GRANTED

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:25.014
ARE VERY SLIGHT.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.482
WELL, WHAT NOW?

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:28.985
I'VE HEARD OF
A WONDERFUL PLACE

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:30.987
FOR DANCING ON A BOAT.

OF ANY WORDS.

COMPLETELY AWARE

COME BACK TONIGHT...

IS IT TRUE?
DID YOU REALLY GET IT?

01:42:50.332 --> 01:42:52.300
DID I GET WHAT?

01:42:52.334 --> 01:42:53.801
THE PRINCESS STORY.

01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:55.770
NO, I DIDN'T GET IT.

01:42:55.803 --> 01:42:57.272
WHAT?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:42:57.305 --> 01:43:00.275
JOE, YOU CAN'T
HOLD OUT ON ME.

01:43:00.308 --> 01:43:01.743
WHO'S HOLDING OUT?

01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:03.745
YOU.
I KNOW TOO MUCH.

01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:05.580
YOU COME
INTO MY OFFICE

01:43:05.613 --> 01:43:08.783
AND ASK
ABOUT AN EXCLUSIVE
ON THE PRINCESS.

01:43:08.816 --> 01:43:10.285
NEXT, YOU DISAPPEAR.

01:43:10.318 --> 01:43:13.621
THEN I HEAR THAT
THE PRINCESS ISN'T SICK.

01:43:13.655 --> 01:43:16.758
YOU BELIEVE EVERY RUMOR
THAT COMES YOUR WAY?

01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:19.627
YEAH, AND A LOT
OF OTHER RUMORS

SECRET SERVICE MEN.

01:43:26.334 --> 01:43:29.804
THEN COMES THE NEWS
OF THE LADY'S
MIRACULOUS RECOVERY.

01:43:29.837 --> 01:43:31.639
IT ALL ADDS UP.

01:43:31.673 --> 01:43:35.310
DON'T THINK YOU'LL RAISE
THE PRICE OF THAT STORY.

01:43:35.343 --> 01:43:37.312
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

01:43:37.345 --> 01:43:39.981
COME ON, COME ON,
WHERE IS THAT STORY?

01:43:40.014 --> 01:43:42.317
I HAVE NO STORY.

01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:44.786
THEN WHAT WAS
THE IDEA OF...

01:43:44.819 --> 01:43:46.588
JOE!

01:43:47.789 --> 01:43:50.492
MAN, WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THESE.

01:43:50.525 --> 01:43:53.461
HIYA, MR. HENNESSY.
YOU GOT HERE ON TIME.

01:43:53.495 --> 01:43:55.797
WAIT TILL YOU
GET A LOOK...

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:57.599
WHAT'S THE IDEA?

01:43:57.632 --> 01:44:01.636
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
CHARGING IN HERE
AND SPILLING THINGS?

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:05.307
I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THAT
ONCE BEFORE, REMEMBER?

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:07.342
JOE,
LOOK AT MY PANTS.

01:44:07.375 --> 01:44:09.344
COME DRY THEM OFF.

01:44:09.377 --> 01:44:10.778
NUTS TO THAT.

01:44:10.812 --> 01:44:13.481
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT SMITTY?

01:44:13.515 --> 01:44:14.482
SMITTY?

01:44:14.516 --> 01:44:15.583
IRVING.

01:44:15.617 --> 01:44:16.784
WAIT TILL...

01:44:16.818 --> 01:44:19.287
THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
IRVING.

01:44:20.855 --> 01:44:22.357
JOE.

01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:24.826
ALL RIGHT,
SAVE THAT TILL LATER.

01:44:24.859 --> 01:44:27.862
WHY DON'T YOU
GO HOME AND SHAVE?

01:44:27.895 --> 01:44:29.030
SHAVE?

01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:30.465
OR KEEP QUIET

01:44:30.498 --> 01:44:33.668
TILL MR. HENNESSY AND I
FINISH TALKING.

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:36.838
HEY, WHAT KIND
OF A ROUTINE IS THAT?

01:44:36.871 --> 01:44:38.340
WHO'S SMITTY?

01:44:38.373 --> 01:44:40.308
A GUY THAT WE MET.

01:44:40.342 --> 01:44:42.644
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SEE?

01:44:42.677 --> 01:44:45.347
IRVING'S DAMES.
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THEM.

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:47.315
UH, MAYBE YOU WOULD.

01:44:47.349 --> 01:44:49.651
WHEN YOU CAME
INTO MY OFFICE...

01:44:49.684 --> 01:44:53.321
I THOUGHT I HAD A LEAD.
I WAS WRONG.

01:44:53.355 --> 01:44:57.559
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
THERE IS NO STORY.

01:44:59.461 --> 01:45:01.929
SHE'S HOLDING
THE PRESS INTERVIEW TODAY.

01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:03.898
SAME TIME, SAME PLACE.

01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:07.535
MAYBE THAT'S ONE STORY
YOU CAN GET.

01:45:07.569 --> 01:45:10.104
AND YOU OWE ME
5OO BUCKS!

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:14.342
TAKE IT OUT OF MY SALARY...
5O BUCKS A WEEK.

01:45:14.376 --> 01:45:16.378
DON'T THINK I WON'T.

01:45:16.411 --> 01:45:17.812
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:45:17.845 --> 01:45:19.113
HEY, WHAT GIVES?

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:21.649
HAVE WE HAD
A BETTER OFFER?

01:45:21.683 --> 01:45:26.120
IRVING,
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT...

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:29.323
WAIT TILL I
SIT DOWN.

01:45:30.692 --> 01:45:37.365
WELL, IN REGARD
TO THE STORY THAT
GOES WITH THESE...

01:45:37.399 --> 01:45:39.867
THERE IS NO STORY.

01:45:41.403 --> 01:45:42.970
WHY NOT?

01:45:43.004 --> 01:45:47.409
I MEAN, NOT AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED.

01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:00.655
UH... HEY, THE PICTURES
CAME OUT PRETTY WELL.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:05.760
YOU... WANT TO HAVE
A LOOK AT THEM?

01:46:10.565 --> 01:46:11.966
HUH?

01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:16.604
HOW ABOUT A BLOWUP

01:46:16.638 --> 01:46:19.106
FROM A NEGATIVE
THAT SIZE, HUH?

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:22.176
OH, THAT'S HER
FIRST CIGARETTE, HUH?

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:23.845
OH, YEAH.

01:46:23.878 --> 01:46:26.080
HEY,
THE MOUTH OF TRUTH.

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.649
HA HA HA!

01:46:27.682 --> 01:46:30.051
HERE'S THE CAPTION
I THOUGHT OF...

01:46:30.084 --> 01:46:31.986
"BARBER CUTS IN."
HUH?

01:46:32.019 --> 01:46:36.758
I FIGURED THIS
WOULD BE THE KEY SHOT
FOR THE LAYOUT...

01:46:36.791 --> 01:46:38.926
"THE WALL WHERE
WISHES COME TRUE."

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.428
JOE, THAT'S GOOD.

01:46:40.462 --> 01:46:44.432
LEAD OFF WITH THAT,
THEN FOLLOW UP
WITH THE WISHES.

01:46:44.466 --> 01:46:47.435
I DUG THAT UP
OUT OF THE FILE.

01:46:47.469 --> 01:46:48.936
"PRINCESS
INSPECTS POLICE."

01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:51.172
YEAH.

01:46:51.205 --> 01:46:52.840
"POLICE
INSPECTS PRINCESS."

01:46:52.874 --> 01:46:54.776
OH!

01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:56.077
HOW ABOUT... OH!

01:46:56.110 --> 01:46:58.880
I GOT A TOPPER
FOR YOU.

01:47:00.848 --> 01:47:01.849
WOW!

01:47:01.883 --> 01:47:03.851
IS THAT A SHOT, JOE?

01:47:03.885 --> 01:47:05.687
WHAT A PICTURE!

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.855
"BODYGUARD
GETS BODY BLOW."

01:47:07.889 --> 01:47:09.156
HOW ABOUT THIS...

01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:10.825
"CROWNED HEAD."
HUH?

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:12.660
OH, I GET IT!

01:47:12.694 --> 01:47:14.962
THAT'S...
JOE, YOU GOT...

01:47:20.868 --> 01:47:22.670
SHE'S FAIR GAME,
JOE.

01:47:22.704 --> 01:47:25.973
IT'S ALWAYS
OPEN SEASON
ON PRINCESSES.

01:47:27.208 --> 01:47:30.211
YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

01:47:30.244 --> 01:47:32.213
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

01:47:32.246 --> 01:47:35.216
I CAN'T PREVENT YOU
FROM SELLING THE PICTURES,

01:47:35.249 --> 01:47:37.218
IF YOU WANT TO.

01:47:37.251 --> 01:47:39.220
YOU'LL GET A GOOD PRICE.

01:47:39.253 --> 01:47:40.822
YEAH!

01:47:46.728 --> 01:47:48.996
YOU GOING TO
THE INTERVIEW?

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:50.665
ARE YOU GOING?

01:47:50.698 --> 01:47:53.835
YEAH.
IT'S AN ASSIGNMENT,
ISN'T IT?

01:47:53.868 --> 01:47:56.003
YEAH.

01:48:00.875 --> 01:48:03.010
I'LL SEE YOU.

01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:21.696
IT AIN'T MUCH,
BUT IT'S HOME.

01:48:31.172 --> 01:48:34.709
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE APPROACH.

01:49:01.002 --> 01:49:02.904

01:49:33.801 --> 01:49:35.703

01:49:35.737 --> 01:49:38.973
THE LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE PRESS.

01:50:15.242 --> 01:50:16.878
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

01:50:16.911 --> 01:50:19.981
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL NOW
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.

01:50:20.014 --> 01:50:22.650
I BELIEVE
AT THE OUTSET,
YOUR HIGHNESS,

01:50:22.684 --> 01:50:26.654
THAT I SHOULD
EXPRESS THE PLEASURE
OF ALL OF US

01:50:26.688 --> 01:50:29.957
AT YOUR RECOVERY FROM
THE RECENT ILLNESS.

01:50:31.192 --> 01:50:33.094
THANK YOU.

01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:37.131
DOES YOUR HIGHNESS
BELIEVE THAT FEDERATION

01:50:37.164 --> 01:50:38.432
WOULD BE
A POSSIBLE SOLUTION

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:41.302
TO EUROPE'S
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS?

01:50:41.335 --> 01:50:44.438
I AM IN FAVOR
OF ANY MEASURE

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:49.443
WHICH WOULD LEAD TO CLOSER
COOPERATION IN EUROPE.

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:52.446
AND WHAT, IN THE OPINION
OF YOUR HIGHNESS,

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:56.450
IS THE OUTLOOK FOR
FRIENDSHIP AMONG NATIONS?

01:50:56.483 --> 01:51:00.822
I HAVE EVERY
FAITH IN IT,

01:51:00.855 --> 01:51:06.761
AS I HAVE FAITH IN
RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE.

01:51:10.264 --> 01:51:16.470
MAY I SAY, SPEAKING
FOR MY OWN PRESS SERVICE,

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:19.140
WE BELIEVE THAT
YOUR HIGHNESS' FAITH

01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:23.010
WILL NOT BE UNJUSTIFIED.

01:51:25.479 --> 01:51:30.451

ENJOY THE MOST?

01:51:44.165 --> 01:51:46.968
EACH IN
ITS OWN WAY...

01:51:49.036 --> 01:51:54.008
EACH IN ITS OWN WAY
WAS... UNFORGETTABLE.

01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:56.978
IT WOULD
BE DIFFICULT TO...

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:00.748
ROME.

01:52:00.782 --> 01:52:02.483
