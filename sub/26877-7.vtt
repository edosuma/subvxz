-Fine, take it.
-That's right, bitch.

He never had a chance.

But before shit went south,
Guadalajara was the fucking place.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.075
It was where mariachi music was invented.
Tequila too.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.286

Félix had changed the game.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.290

[Kiki in English] Fuck.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.438
Kikito! Playtime's after dinner, okay?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.148
[Kiki] Hey! Come on.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.026
But I hate fish sticks.
I want mac and cheese.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.862
Go. Take it to the table.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.828
Go put on a shirt.
Okay.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.459
[Kikito] Why can't we go where Mom is?
I want to be with Mom.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.086
You know what?
Mom's going to be home very soon, okay?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.005
Then we're going to move
to San Diego together.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.341
That means you've caught all the bad guys?

20:17.424 --> 20:20.636
Just... [sighs] Can you just eat, please?

20:22.095 --> 20:23.347
Stupid.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.308
[gunshots]

20:26.391 --> 20:27.559
[Kiki] Go to your room, mijo.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.811
[dog barking]

21:05.347 --> 21:07.015
[Félix in Spanish]
Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:07.432 --> 21:10.894
You know what happens
if you'd hit someone in that club?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.315
You know who goes to that club?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.442
Rich kids.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.945
Families that fucking mean something.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.573
And take off those glasses.

21:25.033 --> 21:25.867
[Rafa chuckles]

21:26.952 --> 21:29.371
My father used to give me that look.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.083
You already know
what I think of that asshole.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.796
The thing with you and Amado,
it has to stop.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.131
It will...

21:40.382 --> 21:41.842
when I kill him.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.054
[Rafa laughs]

21:46.138 --> 21:48.473
What's with you and that guy, anyway?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.435
That guy...

21:52.311 --> 21:54.354
just happens to be Neto's nephew.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.941
In other words, your business partner.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.194
-He works for you.
-No, he works for you.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.697
You don't give a shit
about the thing we built.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.198
Well...

22:06.074 --> 22:09.786
Don't worry, nothing changes.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.081
We're not substituting your product.

22:14.207 --> 22:18.712
-We're adding a new one, that's it.
-So why is no one moving my product?

22:21.006 --> 22:24.259
Then why the fuck haven't you been
to the field, man? For two months? Three?

22:24.551 --> 22:28.472
If you'd been there,
you'd know it's all fucking rotting.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.141
Just sitting there.
No one's fucking moving it!

22:35.687 --> 22:37.939
My sinsemilla put you
where you're standing.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.611
None of this other shit
happens without it.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.451
You think I don't know that?

22:53.080 --> 22:53.997
I know.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.296
I need you, man.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.883
Then get rid of Amado...

23:06.134 --> 23:07.803
or I will.

23:16.978 --> 23:17.979
Oh, gracias.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.023
[in English] Thank you very much. Gracias.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.109
That's the grand torta
I was telling you about.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.235
Grand indeed.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.905
[Kikito] Man, this is delicious.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.115
You like those, huh?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.158
[Kiki laughs]

23:30.867 --> 23:32.160
[Kikito] No more fish sticks.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.286
[chuckles]

23:33.370 --> 23:34.955
You excited Mom's coming home?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.790
[Kikito] Obviously.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.752
[door closes]

23:51.555 --> 23:52.556
[Kikito] Dad.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.892
-Who is it?
-[Kiki] Wait right there.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.694
Félix!

24:06.653 --> 24:09.030
-[engine turns over]
-I'm talking to you, motherfucker!

24:15.412 --> 24:17.414
[horn honks]

24:24.171 --> 24:25.297
[in English] Can we talk for a second?

24:26.339 --> 24:28.383
-Yeah.
-[Kiki] Somewhere else?

24:29.676 --> 24:30.552
Sure.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.739
[Félix] Maria?

24:53.825 --> 24:55.327
[in Spanish] I'm going to Sinaloa.

24:55.785 --> 24:56.786
What?

25:00.123 --> 25:01.541
Where are the children?

25:02.542 --> 25:03.752
With my mom.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.337
I sent them this morning.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.631
It's better they not see you.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.343
Wait. Maria. Maria, wait!

25:12.302 --> 25:13.845
What's going on?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.514
You spend the evening with her?

25:16.139 --> 25:17.224
[Félix] Huh?

25:17.807 --> 25:19.142
We came by the hotel.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.061
You were with her.

25:25.815 --> 25:26.733
Isabella.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.487
Isabella? [chuckles]

25:31.154 --> 25:32.364
You're kidding.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.785
I've known her since she was a girl.
She's like my niece.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.206
She's part of this business.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.083
What about the others?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.961
They're also a part of this business?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.881
The girl at the gallery...

25:52.342 --> 25:54.219
She's pregnant, asshole.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.388
Maria? Maria!

25:56.471 --> 25:58.473
-Go away.
-Maria, wait!

25:58.557 --> 25:59.558
Come here.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.101
Get you fucking hands off me!

26:01.685 --> 26:04.437
[panting]

26:04.521 --> 26:05.939
-[Félix] Maria, stop!
-No!

26:06.022 --> 26:07.107
Fucking listen to me!

26:07.190 --> 26:10.402
Enough! Stop, damn it!

26:10.485 --> 26:11.653
Enough.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.405
[Maria panting]

26:15.699 --> 26:18.535
You're the most important person
in my life.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.246
Is that clear?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.082
But you aren't the same.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.668
And I'm leaving.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.390
[both breathing heavily]

26:40.473 --> 26:42.100
[whispers] I want to fix this.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.146
I want to fix this.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.899
Then come back to Sinaloa.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.452
[Maria]
This business has become your life.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.911
-No, no, no.
-Yes.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.538
This is our business.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.914
It's ours.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.541
It's for you.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.212
It's yours.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.267
What can I do?

27:25.935 --> 27:28.271
You've made the agreement
with the Colombians.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.231
You made a deal with them.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.777
You can run this business from anywhere.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.536
Come home.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.804
[in English] I don't like that smile.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.430
Hola, Fredo.

28:02.722 --> 28:03.890
What up, gringo?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.059
Hey, can we buy you a drink?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.227
Sure. Why not?

28:07.310 --> 28:08.978
Great. We'll follow you.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.407
[Fredo in English] I help you out on this,
what are you going to do?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.492
I mean, how high is it going to go?

28:26.162 --> 28:27.497
[sighs]

28:29.124 --> 28:30.792
All the way to the top.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.342
I heard one of your CIs got killed
a little while back.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.554
Yeah. It's dangerous,
the noise we'd be generating.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.808
You've heard the news
of the eradication program, right?

28:49.477 --> 28:51.896
[Fredo]
Agricultural Department is rolling it up.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.150
Planes are being sent over to Belize.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.818
[laughs]

28:56.901 --> 28:59.779
Belize? Yeah, because they've got
such a problem down there.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.031
[Jaime] Jesus Christ.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.914
How long have you put into that program?

29:11.624 --> 29:12.792
Four years.

29:14.627 --> 29:15.628
Oh.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.467
-Four years of your life into something.
-[Fredo] Yeah.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.929
Everything you've got. For what?

29:36.191 --> 29:38.193
You can help us do something about it.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.037
[indistinct chatter]

30:33.498 --> 30:35.250
[video game sounds]

30:38.711 --> 30:41.130
[in Spanish] Hey, kid,
need to go to Guadalajara.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.509
-Boss called a meeting at the hotel.
-[Ramon] For what?

30:44.592 --> 30:45.468
No idea.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.429
Just said to be there.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.892
[Hector]
Boss called a meeting. At the hotel.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.144
-Did he say why?
-[Hector] No.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.480
[Chapo]
Said he wants to talk at the hotel.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.107
Did he say why?

30:59.190 --> 31:00.692
[man] Just wants to talk.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.570
[man] He'd like you to attend.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.951
[El Azul]
Something about "reorganization."

31:10.660 --> 31:12.495
Says he'll explain everything there.

31:13.913 --> 31:19.127
[Nava]
Finally, that fucker is coming around.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.963
[crickets chirping]

31:35.768 --> 31:37.562
[radio announcer in Spanish]

31:52.911 --> 31:54.037
[Mika in English] Where are you going?

31:54.621 --> 31:55.538
Oh.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.960
I'm going for a run.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.545
[Mika chuckles]

32:04.005 --> 32:05.632
You're the worst liar I know.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.301
That's because I never do, baby.

32:11.721 --> 32:12.805
What are you up to?

32:15.725 --> 32:17.060
Something I got to do.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.188
Work?

32:23.524 --> 32:24.525
Sort of.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.196
[Mika] Kiki, we leave in a week.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.660
-You told me you were done.
-Well, and I will be.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.585
This about the Wizard of Oz?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.979
Whatever it is you're doing,
are you sure it's a good idea?

33:02.563 --> 33:04.816
You said it yourself,
no one wants to hear it.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.361
[Kiki] I just...

33:11.447 --> 33:13.825
I know that I just can't
leave this place...

33:15.618 --> 33:17.787
without that motherfucker knowing my name.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.044
He has to.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.272
[vehicle approaching]

33:46.190 --> 33:47.108
[in Spanish] What, Fredo?

33:47.191 --> 33:50.111
-Putting in overtime?
-Better than putting up with my wife.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.904
[laughs]

34:05.960 --> 34:08.296
[Kiki in English] Don't you need
some sort of lights to take off?

34:08.379 --> 34:09.380
[Zavala] Nope.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.215
Don't get nervous on me now.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.093
I'm counting on you
to handle the camera, Kiki.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.220
Don't worry, I got it.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.395
[inhales]

34:26.105 --> 34:27.273
[inhales]

34:31.861 --> 34:32.695
[grunts]

34:32.779 --> 34:33.946
Ah!

34:35.948 --> 34:37.700
[in Spanish]
Let's go, we're taking a ride.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.077
[Sammy] Sure, boss.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.425
Where should I take you, sir?

34:54.509 --> 34:56.636
To see the man who killed my son.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.181
[engine turns over]

35:08.898 --> 35:10.650
[Omar in Spanish]
Make sure you scrub hard.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.113
-Are we almost finished?
-Yes.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.783
Then we'll go out and enjoy
the rest of the day.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.536
Keep drying that side.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.579
There's still a lot of soap.

35:23.663 --> 35:24.956
-Here?
-Yeah.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.088
Hector... that's enough.

35:34.966 --> 35:35.967
Amalia?

35:39.637 --> 35:41.389
Get your stuff and take him
to your mom's.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.393
[car doors close]

35:54.360 --> 35:55.528
How are you, Omar?

36:03.619 --> 36:06.747
[Don Neto] Have to decide
what's important in this life.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.419
Before you wake up...

36:12.712 --> 36:14.130
and it's gone.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.303
Course, me sitting here with you
proves I'm too late.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.898
Do you know why I'm here?

36:31.981 --> 36:34.984
[whimpers]

36:37.028 --> 36:38.029
Yes.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.952
I'm so sorry, sir.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.249
I'm sorry about what happened.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.378
For everything I've done.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.551
I loved Gilberto so much.

37:06.974 --> 37:08.226
Do you believe in God?

37:12.480 --> 37:13.481
No.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.401
-I don't.
-Neither do I.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.071
As a child, I did.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.407
It's important, I think,
to believe when we're young.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.118
Would you agree?

37:26.661 --> 37:27.662
Yes.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.795
But do you know who I worshipped
even more than God?

37:38.881 --> 37:40.466
Jesús Malverde.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.052
Sound familiar? From Sinaloa.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.180
Or so the legend goes.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.017
I liked hearing his story more.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.562
It may as well have been my own.

37:55.314 --> 37:58.901
Born in the fields,
to a family with nothing.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.197
His parents lived a clean life,
did what they could,

38:03.281 --> 38:04.824
but one day, things changed.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.785
He was young.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.331
No choice but to steal.

38:13.207 --> 38:16.377
They called him a thief, a bandit.

38:18.004 --> 38:21.340
Offered rewards for his capture.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.594
He only took what he needed.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.599
Gave everything to the poor.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.478
Loved by the people.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.774
Until one day he was shot.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.193
By a friend...

38:42.945 --> 38:45.072
who wanted the reward.

38:48.909 --> 38:52.538
Took his body to the governor,
who hung him in town for everyone to see.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.833
Forbidden to bury him...

38:57.043 --> 39:00.713
leaving his body to rot, as an example
to all of what happens to outlaws.

39:02.757 --> 39:06.635
His remains falling to the ground,
little by little,

39:06.719 --> 39:10.222
the people covering the body with rocks,
until he was gone.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.059
Rock after rock...

39:14.852 --> 39:17.438
until all that remained
was a shrine built of stone.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.358
Worshipping him.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.949
Because even in sin,
you can still be a saint.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.918
Gilberto loved you.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.544
[Omar sobs]

39:40.628 --> 39:43.839
Loved you like a brother.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.550
I loved him a lot as well.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.805
He was like my brother.

39:52.848 --> 39:58.562
He would've wanted me to come.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.904
I forgive you.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.660
I forgive you, my son.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.334
Gilberto would've wanted me
to forgive him...

41:05.713 --> 41:10.050
but I'd never forgive myself
if I let the man who killed my son live.

41:13.512 --> 41:14.638
Kill him.

41:40.122 --> 41:42.791
[Félix in Spanish]
Look around the room, what do you see?

41:43.751 --> 41:46.462
Consider where we started
and where we sit today.

41:50.424 --> 41:53.302
We got into this business
with the hope of great fortune.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.472
For our families, for our children...

41:58.015 --> 41:59.016
And it was here...

41:59.642 --> 42:04.355
that I asked you
to put your business in my hands.

42:05.231 --> 42:10.611
That with our leverage of superior supply
and our country-wide distribution,

42:10.903 --> 42:13.405
we would dominate the market.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.743
We underestimated ourselves.

42:19.745 --> 42:25.084
Now we have more money
than we can ever spend.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.212
You didn't come
dressed this way last time.

42:28.295 --> 42:30.256
[laughs]

42:31.048 --> 42:33.050
Fucking Acosta.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.972
But show me the man
who's happy with what he has...

42:38.931 --> 42:40.391
and I'll show you the fool.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.143
Hey.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.730
Business is changing
and we must change with it.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.405
I'll be making some adjustments
to the organization...

42:56.949 --> 42:59.410
specifically to management.

43:10.462 --> 43:13.215
Héctor Palma will now be
running operations in Mazatlan.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.470
And Juárez...

43:20.306 --> 43:22.016
we're sending you Amado.

43:23.726 --> 43:28.272
Under your guidance
and with his vision for the future...

43:29.064 --> 43:31.191
that plaza will take on new significance.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.240
Tijuana...

43:45.289 --> 43:46.790
Tijuana stays the same.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.878
The Arellano Félix brothers
will continue to oversee operations.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.590
The future is here...

43:55.633 --> 43:57.468
and that future is cocaine.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.920
[Acosta] I'm with the kid.

44:34.630 --> 44:38.884
"All of us don't sign on,
our 'federation' falls apart."

44:38.967 --> 44:40.386
Isn't that what you said?!

44:42.680 --> 44:43.764
[Félix] Not anymore.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.851
Who made the deal with the Colombians?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.397
I made the deal.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.440
No one else.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.946
Whoever doesn't agree
can get the fuck out of here.

45:19.591 --> 45:20.884
We're good then.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.809
So let's toast to the boss of bosses!

45:29.393 --> 45:32.730
-Cheers.
-[all] Cheers.

45:43.907 --> 45:46.410
[Jaime in English] It's, uh...
just outside of Guadalajara.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.370
A few hundred miles at most.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.582
In the state of Zacatecas.

45:55.753 --> 46:00.632
By our estimation, it's over 1,000 acres.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.928
That's the largest marijuana grow
in history.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.264
By anyone's estimation.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.016
What's your point?

46:10.684 --> 46:12.936
What are you looking
to get out of all of this, hmm?

46:14.271 --> 46:15.522
[Kiki] I'm trying to do my job.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.443
See, you can't ignore this
and neither can the Mexican government.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.529
What I want to see is change.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.448
[Kiki scoffs]

46:24.531 --> 46:27.451
This is the most backward fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.368
[Jaime] Kiki.

46:30.954 --> 46:34.124
Why don't you excuse us a moment,
Agent Camarena?

46:43.008 --> 46:43.842
Door.

46:50.474 --> 46:54.144
-What the fuck, Jaime?
-Sit down, Ed. Sit down.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.979
Ed, it just fell in our laps.

46:59.107 --> 47:04.655
What do we do with this? Understand me?
What do we do with this?

47:04.738 --> 47:06.073
[sighs]

47:07.574 --> 47:08.492
Nothing.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.577
-If this got out--
-[Jaime] Ed's right.

47:10.661 --> 47:13.664
If the press caught wind
that we had this and we buried it,

47:13.747 --> 47:15.499
given the First Lady's stance?

47:16.542 --> 47:17.417
[exhales]

47:17.501 --> 47:19.920
I imagine that would be a pretty bad look.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.881
For all of us.

47:23.465 --> 47:24.800
And how would that happen?

47:24.883 --> 47:26.093
[Jaime] It's Mexico, Ed.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.221
Who the fuck knows? [chuckles]

47:38.272 --> 47:39.189
[Jaime] Ed.

47:54.329 --> 47:55.747
[Jaime sighs]

47:57.708 --> 47:59.001
[Jaime] God damn.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.170
Well?

48:03.714 --> 48:05.799
Well, Ed's about fit to spit.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.384
What are they going to do?

48:08.176 --> 48:09.928
[Jaime] The only thing they can do.

48:11.763 --> 48:13.098
They're going to hit it, Kiki.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.894
They're going to burn
that fucking thing down.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.897
You wanted them to listen.
Well, they heard you loud and clear.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.274
-When are they going to do that?
-Um...

48:22.357 --> 48:24.192
Two weeks. Maybe less. I don't know.

48:24.276 --> 48:27.779
It's not like we can just ask
the MFJP for help. [chuckles]

48:27.863 --> 48:32.117
No, no, no. We gotta do this one right.
It's going to take some time.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.040
[Jaime sighs]

48:39.416 --> 48:41.668
I'm in San Diego in less than a week.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.171
The new transfer kicks in.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.423
[Jaime] Shit.

48:47.883 --> 48:49.301
Forgot about that.

48:52.304 --> 48:55.223
Hey, you still get the win. All right?

48:55.307 --> 48:57.851
Your name is on this
and everyone's going to know it.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.020
Kiki.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.190
You did enough.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.489
Let's go get a beer.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.955
[Félix in Spanish] You're upset.

49:20.749 --> 49:22.626
Reorganizing the plazas?

49:24.127 --> 49:26.088
Said it yourself... [scoffs]

49:26.463 --> 49:28.715
...Sinaloans are resistant to change.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.760
I didn't hear my name.

49:32.928 --> 49:33.762
You lied to me.

49:34.304 --> 49:36.181
I'm not sure that's true.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.560
Give it some time.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.689
A role will emerge
with the Arellano Félix brothers.

49:44.606 --> 49:46.024
I want what I was promised.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.443
-Twenty percent.
-Isabella--

49:48.527 --> 49:50.070
You gave me your word.

49:50.904 --> 49:53.532
-Said if I handled Falcón--
-But you didn't.

49:55.492 --> 49:57.119
I handled him.

49:59.496 --> 50:03.291
And if your partners found out?
What you did, how it was handled?

50:04.710 --> 50:06.211
If I were to tell them?

50:08.380 --> 50:10.966
Be careful what you're saying.

50:15.929 --> 50:17.556
Be careful what I'll do.

50:21.268 --> 50:24.604
Look at me.
You'll take what I give you...

50:26.231 --> 50:28.108
or have nothing at all.

50:28.942 --> 50:30.110
Understood?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.801
[Kikito growling]

50:59.473 --> 51:00.974
[in English] What are you doing there?

51:01.058 --> 51:03.018
Come on. We're setting the table.

51:45.185 --> 51:47.020
So are you going to tell me or what?

51:49.356 --> 51:50.315
What?

51:51.399 --> 51:52.442
How'd it go?

51:54.569 --> 51:55.904
Oh, uh...

51:56.613 --> 52:00.033
They took our intel
and said they were going to act.

52:01.993 --> 52:02.953
And?

52:06.456 --> 52:08.041
We're going to take the fields.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.504
[Mika] Mmm.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.842
-You did it, Agent Camarena.
-[Kiki chuckles]

52:16.925 --> 52:19.177
Going out with a bang. Hmm.

52:19.261 --> 52:20.178
Yeah.

52:20.262 --> 52:23.890
And, uh... Jaime said that, uh...

52:24.975 --> 52:26.726
it'll probably take a couple weeks.

52:28.311 --> 52:30.814
You know, so I'm gonna need
a little bit more time.

52:32.899 --> 52:34.276
[Mika sighs]

52:34.734 --> 52:36.945
-[Mika] I'm not doing this on my own.
-[Kiki] Mika.

52:37.028 --> 52:38.155
-What?
-Wait.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.322
What?

52:40.198 --> 52:42.325
What's more important?
This or your family?

52:48.165 --> 52:50.792
When is it finally enough, Kiki?

52:52.419 --> 52:53.503
[Kiki] Mika!

52:54.379 --> 52:57.132
[piano music playing]

52:58.675 --> 52:59.885
[in Spanish] Hey.

53:18.028 --> 53:20.071
-You pack everything?
-Yes.

53:23.491 --> 53:25.410
It's time for us to go home.

53:35.503 --> 53:37.505
You know me better than anyone.

53:43.136 --> 53:45.472
I knew we would be able to fix this.

53:47.265 --> 53:48.391
Together.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.021
[Maria sighs]

54:00.445 --> 54:01.655
You were right.

54:05.408 --> 54:06.743
I have changed.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.668
This is my home.

54:18.713 --> 54:20.173
My life is here.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.933
And I'm not going back to Sinaloa.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.447
You'll be fine.

54:50.203 --> 54:51.746
I don't need you anymore.

55:09.639 --> 55:12.142
[in Spanish] Cuco? Have you seen Neto?

55:12.225 --> 55:14.978
-[Cuco] What the fuck, man? You came.
-Have you seen Neto?

55:15.812 --> 55:19.482
No. Went to his house and he wasn't there.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.110
Glad you came, Rafa.

55:22.527 --> 55:23.611
You heard from Neto?

55:24.362 --> 55:26.781
[Cochiloco] Old man has
a lot on his plate right now.

55:27.240 --> 55:33.079
Why don't I fill yours up? [laughs]

55:33.163 --> 55:35.248
You gotta try this shrimp.

55:36.207 --> 55:37.625
Straight from Mazatlan.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.837
Not hungry. Just give me a beer.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.005
Take that one.

55:43.548 --> 55:45.675
You want to do some coke?

55:47.719 --> 55:50.096
Fuck yeah, I wanna do some coke!

55:50.472 --> 55:53.975
-But what are they really saying?
-Man, just shut the fuck up!

55:54.059 --> 55:56.811
[Rafa] You don't turn your back on family.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.565
He prefers planes? Fuck him!

56:01.566 --> 56:03.985
Weed gives us reasoning.

56:04.235 --> 56:07.113
-Weed is life.
-Cocaine is good, too.

56:07.489 --> 56:10.116
[Cochiloco] We're flying in
fresh seafood from Mazatlan.

56:10.200 --> 56:13.370
Met a guy with his own airplane.
Gets the shrimp early--

56:13.453 --> 56:15.830
Don't talk to me about fucking airplanes!

56:18.083 --> 56:20.043
[man 1 in English] This is it, right here.

56:20.126 --> 56:22.337
I'm telling you, man.
You gotta try the carnitas.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.630
They are the best in the city.

56:23.713 --> 56:25.465
Thank you so much. Gracias.

56:26.091 --> 56:28.134
Ah, yeah. So good it's closed.

56:28.218 --> 56:30.553
Fuck. Shit.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.056
What about over here?

56:34.974 --> 56:37.602
-Sinaloan-style seafood?
-Exactly.

56:37.894 --> 56:39.104
-Really?
-Come on, man.

56:39.187 --> 56:42.357
-I was kinda feeling carnitas.
-You never want to try anything new.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.275
How you gonna be a writer
if you don't want adventure?

56:44.359 --> 56:47.570
Oh, man, I know how things go
when it's an adventure with you.

56:47.654 --> 56:49.280
No, listen. Think of it this way.

56:49.364 --> 56:52.909
It's all you can eat, I imagine,
because it's Mexico.

56:52.992 --> 56:54.536
-All right. Now you're talking.
-It's cheaper.

56:54.619 --> 56:56.871
And Sinaloan seafood
is considered the best.

56:56.955 --> 56:59.374
-In all of Mexico. Everyone knows.
-Portions look large.

56:59.457 --> 57:00.917
[man 1] Not all gringos know this.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.628
-[man 2] I'm not a gringo.
-[man 1] We are completely gringos.

57:03.711 --> 57:06.464
[man 2] All right, I'm a gringo.
But you're a gringo too.

57:08.049 --> 57:09.884
[man 2] Is it even open?

57:09.968 --> 57:13.263
[in Spanish] We're tourists
from the United States.

57:13.346 --> 57:14.806
Thank you so much.

57:15.265 --> 57:17.642
-[in English] We're good, man.
-[man 2] Nice.

57:17.725 --> 57:20.645
See, this place--
this place is fucking authentic.

57:20.728 --> 57:22.272
Yeah, like that mural.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.525
Yeah, man, you know what?

57:25.650 --> 57:27.277
You know what, right here?

57:28.528 --> 57:30.697
That's our monologue in chapter two.
Gracias.

57:30.780 --> 57:32.615
That's our monologue in chapter two.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.451
A painting the guy sees on the wall.

57:34.534 --> 57:35.994
Yeah, yeah. Write that down.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.792
I don't think they stay fresh.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.335
Look at these fucking guys.

57:48.047 --> 57:49.299
[Cuco] They're Americans, man.

57:49.382 --> 57:51.134
They're writing your name, Rafa.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.428
-Could they be DEA?
-They're DEA?

57:53.511 --> 57:54.971
They're cops, Rafa.

57:55.054 --> 57:57.348
[Cochiloco] They're the assholes
that were outside my house.

57:57.432 --> 57:59.017
You motherfuckers!

57:59.100 --> 58:01.311
Lock the doors!

58:01.394 --> 58:03.605
What the fuck are you writing?!

58:03.688 --> 58:05.440
[Cochiloco] You're fucking cops!

58:05.523 --> 58:08.735
[overlapping yells]

58:13.323 --> 58:14.199
[gunshot]

58:14.282 --> 58:15.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:15.825 --> 58:16.951
-We're Americans!
-[gunshot]

58:20.246 --> 58:22.749
[grunting]

58:32.342 --> 58:33.885
[grunts]

58:37.514 --> 58:39.557
[grunting]

59:06.376 --> 59:07.752
Move, motherfucker!

59:08.545 --> 59:09.671
Turn him over.

59:18.888 --> 59:19.973
[Rafa grunting]

1:00:14.777 --> 1:00:19.699
[Nava in Spanish] "The boss of bosses."

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:22.619
Very...

1:00:23.703 --> 1:00:26.414
Very moving speech.

1:00:26.497 --> 1:00:28.082
I was very impressed.

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:30.835
So eloquent.

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:36.299
But I didn't hear shit, as far as my take.

1:00:39.802 --> 1:00:43.222
You want to discuss your price,
set an appointment with my secretary.

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:47.560
Fuck your secretary.

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:52.106
Fuck your secretary.
Fuck your mother. Fuck your dog.

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:56.319
I'm the one that gives you orders.
You understand, asshole?

1:01:00.198 --> 1:01:02.367
[grunting]

1:01:11.501 --> 1:01:13.503
[panting]

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:18.174
[grunts]

1:01:25.723 --> 1:01:26.724
[elevator dings]

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:35.358
Someone has a problem with this...

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:38.820
they know where to find me.
