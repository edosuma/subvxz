<i>Louise: Uh, lower.</i>

00:21.252 --> 00:22.452
L-lower.

00:22.486 --> 00:23.520
L-little lower.

00:23.554 --> 00:24.854
Just a tiny bit more.

00:24.889 --> 00:26.222
- Uh...
- Yeah, in the trash.

00:26.257 --> 00:27.524
Now, stomp it down with your foot.

00:27.558 --> 00:28.676
Louise, I'm beginning to think

00:28.700 --> 00:31.294
you might not care about Jimmy
Jr. winning this election.

00:31.328 --> 00:32.695
You're so wrong, Tina.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.297
I definitely don't care.

00:34.331 --> 00:35.699
Well, he's going to win.

00:35.733 --> 00:37.133
Henry Haber is the only other candidate,

00:37.168 --> 00:39.736
and his campaign slogan is "chess we can."

00:39.770 --> 00:40.737
Which game is chess again?

00:40.771 --> 00:41.738
The one with the checkers?

00:41.772 --> 00:43.173
Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.

00:43.207 --> 00:45.041
Why is my campaign poster in the trash?

00:45.076 --> 00:46.476
Because it won't fit in the toilet.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.144
Doesn't matter... the math club did a poll,

00:48.179 --> 00:49.879
and I'm up by 95 points.

00:49.914 --> 00:51.881
We're talking landslide, baby.

00:51.916 --> 00:53.650
(Laughing): Here come the mud!

00:53.684 --> 00:55.485
- (Laughing): Okay, don't landslide me, Zeke.
- I'm gonna get you.

00:55.519 --> 00:57.320
- I'm gonna get you. Come on, come on.
- Ow. Ow.

00:57.354 --> 00:59.723
Why do you even want to
be president, Jimmy Jr.?

00:59.757 --> 01:01.191
To pick songs at dances.

01:01.225 --> 01:03.892
I hate it when it goes fast
song, slow song, medium song.

01:04.361 --> 01:06.529
I want ten fasts, then ten slows.

01:06.564 --> 01:08.164
Guys, shh, Haber-danger.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.166
Oh, hey, Habes... you
about ready to say Uncle?

01:10.201 --> 01:11.868
The election is still four days away.

01:11.902 --> 01:13.536
Ever hear of the tortoise and the hare?

01:13.571 --> 01:15.105
Uh, no.

01:15.139 --> 01:16.740
What're you sayin' about Jimmy Jr.'s hair?

01:16.774 --> 01:18.742
It's nice!
- I mean, "hare", like, rabbit.

01:18.776 --> 01:20.243
Well, your hair looks like a weasel.

01:20.277 --> 01:21.945
What? That's... (Laughing)

01:21.979 --> 01:23.446
- Fast song, fast song, fast song...
- Go, go...

01:23.481 --> 01:24.881
- fast song, fast song, fast song...
- Go, go.

01:24.900 --> 01:25.320
fast song, fast...

01:25.416 --> 01:27.517
All right, Jimmy Jr. for president.

01:29.553 --> 01:30.620
They got a lotta ladles.

01:30.654 --> 01:31.788
Ooh, I liked saying that.

01:31.822 --> 01:33.056
Lotta ladles, lotta ladles.

01:33.090 --> 01:34.457
Lotta ladles, lotta ladles.
- Bob: Lin.

01:34.492 --> 01:35.625
- Lotta ladles, lotta ladles,
- Lin.

01:35.659 --> 01:36.660
- Lotta ladles.
- Lin, look at this.

01:36.694 --> 01:37.294
What?

01:37.328 --> 01:39.262
A kitchen knife for $300.

01:39.296 --> 01:41.231
- $300?!
- You think if I pick it up,

01:41.265 --> 01:43.233
a giant rock will come rolling at us?

01:43.267 --> 01:44.467
Wha...?

01:44.502 --> 01:46.202
I'm talking about Indiana Jo...

01:46.237 --> 01:47.604
Who the hell's Indiana Joe?

01:47.638 --> 01:49.439
- Whoa.
- Bob?

01:49.473 --> 01:51.441
(Singing nonsense)

01:51.475 --> 01:52.442
Hi, Louise! (Screams)

01:52.476 --> 01:53.777
Crap! Millie!

01:53.811 --> 01:55.211
What are you sneaking up on me for?

01:55.246 --> 01:57.213
I have a new secret handshake for us.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.815
I bend your finger really far back.
- Ow!

01:58.849 --> 02:00.450
And you bend my finger really far back.

02:00.484 --> 02:02.452
And then into a hug-shake! (Groans)

02:02.486 --> 02:04.087
Stop hug-shaking me.

02:04.121 --> 02:05.889
Tina, get her off of me!

02:05.923 --> 02:07.490
Okay, um, can you let her go?

02:07.525 --> 02:08.991
(Sighs) So what's new, Millie?

02:09.026 --> 02:10.759
Oh, I'm just doing the fourth grade thing.

02:10.794 --> 02:13.229
You know, taking some classes,
squeezing in some recess.

02:13.264 --> 02:14.831
All that running around
doesn't leave enough time

02:14.865 --> 02:16.800
for my best friend over here, though.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.435
We're not best friends, Millie.

02:18.469 --> 02:20.103
Right, I'm your Nemesis...
we love each other,

02:20.137 --> 02:21.404
but we've got some history.

02:21.439 --> 02:22.906
You're not my Nemesis.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.908
We are, we're nemesises... ses.

02:24.942 --> 02:26.509
We're rivals who are also totally obsessed

02:26.544 --> 02:27.977
with each other... "fremesises."

02:28.012 --> 02:29.412
Oh, like Batman and Catwoman.

02:29.447 --> 02:30.814
And like socks and sandals.

02:30.848 --> 02:32.415
Millie, this is all in your head.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.683
We are nothing. Nothing!

02:33.718 --> 02:34.818
So we're on for lunch?

02:34.852 --> 02:37.253
No, we're not on for anything.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.855
I want a Millie-free zone around me,

02:38.889 --> 02:40.490
at least three lunch tables wide.

02:40.524 --> 02:41.491
Okay, three inches wide.

02:41.525 --> 02:42.492
Not three inches!

02:42.526 --> 02:43.793
Three tables!

02:43.828 --> 02:45.195
♪ Little bunny Lou-Lou ♪

02:45.229 --> 02:46.796

02:46.831 --> 02:48.198
I don't even know why we're talking,

02:48.232 --> 02:50.934
because I am not getting a $300 knife.

02:50.968 --> 02:52.469
No, of course.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.471
The Fukinawa is really only
for professional chefs...

02:54.505 --> 02:56.473
Well, I'm a professional chef, actually.

02:56.507 --> 02:57.874
Eh. Of course.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.509
- I am.
- Absolutely you are.

02:59.543 --> 03:01.945
It doesn't mean I buy $300 knives.

03:01.979 --> 03:04.147
That are "hand-forged
by a master blacksmith

03:04.181 --> 03:05.982
in his mountaintop workshop."

03:06.017 --> 03:07.384
Oh, boy, that's really good.

03:07.418 --> 03:09.386
- Why is that good?
- Are we doing this?

03:09.420 --> 03:11.621
Okay, I'm recommending a
24-hour cooling-off period.

03:11.656 --> 03:13.023
I think we're doing this.

03:13.057 --> 03:14.457
Here, hold on.

03:14.492 --> 03:15.525
Spread it around.

03:18.362 --> 03:19.963
Chess we can.

03:19.997 --> 03:21.564
Mm-hmm, thanks.

03:21.599 --> 03:23.533
Another Jimmy Jr. Voter, huh?

03:23.567 --> 03:25.669
I get it, he's everybody's friend.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.304
Yeah, I'm not really political.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.005
I'd rather be everybody's president.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.408
You're their friend, but you're their boss.
- Oh?

03:31.442 --> 03:33.643
You-you have power over 'em, to help them.

03:33.678 --> 03:35.045
Power...

03:35.079 --> 03:36.646
- To help.
- Power.

03:36.681 --> 03:38.048
Y-you're focusing on the power.

03:38.082 --> 03:39.482
Power.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.484
I should... I'm gonna pass these out...

03:41.519 --> 03:42.519
- Power.
- Over here.

03:43.888 --> 03:45.855
No. I'm running for president, Louise.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.691
(Laughs)

03:47.725 --> 03:49.426
Ooh, I love your poster font, Millie.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.694
They use it for horror movies.

03:50.728 --> 03:52.162
Uh, Mr. frond?

03:52.196 --> 03:54.164
A fourth grader can't be president, right?

03:54.198 --> 03:56.166
Don't be a grade-ist, Louise.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.567
It's a young person's job.

03:57.602 --> 03:59.035
There's a lot of burnout.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.670
Button? (Screams)

04:00.705 --> 04:02.072
Get that thing away from me.

04:02.106 --> 04:04.207
And good luck convincing
anybody to vote for you.

04:04.241 --> 04:05.775
Thanks for your support!

04:05.810 --> 04:06.843
(Laughs)

04:06.877 --> 04:08.578
Louise: Good-bye, Millie.

04:08.613 --> 04:10.213
With all the ballots counted,

04:10.248 --> 04:13.250
Wagstaff's new president is Millie Frock.

04:13.284 --> 04:14.684
Ugh, I don't believe it!

04:14.719 --> 04:16.086
Louise, can you come up here, please?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.187
I want to make an announcement.

04:17.221 --> 04:18.255
No, thank you.

04:18.289 --> 04:19.689
Wrestling team, bring her to me.

04:19.724 --> 04:21.725
Ugh, let me go!

04:21.759 --> 04:23.927
Home ec class, sew her to my side.

04:23.961 --> 04:25.362
(Louise gasps)

04:25.396 --> 04:27.631
Metal shop, make a metal sculpture of us.

Oh, what a coincidence.

04:44.015 --> 04:45.482
You watch me when I sleep, too?

04:45.516 --> 04:46.983
No, I want to join the Jimmy Jr. campaign.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.985
(Yawning): Welcome aboard.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.654
I'll show you how to use
the puffy paints tomorrow.

04:50.688 --> 04:52.088
No, I know how to use them.

04:52.123 --> 04:53.456
I want to manage his campaign.

04:53.491 --> 04:54.658
But, um, that's what I do.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.493
Shh, shush, just go back to sleep.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.262
When you wake up, you'll be
assistant campaign manager.

04:59.297 --> 05:00.263
- But I'm the...
- Shh!

05:00.298 --> 05:01.298

05:02.610 --> 05:04.211
Millie is already up
to one percent support.

05:04.245 --> 05:06.780
Our lead was this, now it's this.

05:06.814 --> 05:08.982
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean "our" lead?

05:09.016 --> 05:10.884
Did Tina die and make you campaign manager?

05:10.918 --> 05:12.685
No, I didn't die, I just fell asleep.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.087
Well, I'm really popular.

05:14.121 --> 05:15.321
I'm not worried about Millie.

05:15.355 --> 05:16.523
You should be.

05:16.557 --> 05:18.658
Last month we had to
name the class chinchilla,

05:18.693 --> 05:20.293
<i>and Millie had the worst idea of all.</i>

05:20.328 --> 05:21.761
How about princess little piddles?

05:21.796 --> 05:22.929
<i>I said what everyone was thinking.</i>

05:22.964 --> 05:24.764
How about princess Fluffy vomit?

05:24.799 --> 05:25.932
Right, Millie?

05:25.967 --> 05:27.500
Is that what you're going for?

05:27.535 --> 05:29.469
You're gonna ruin this chinchilla's life.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.937
Then we all voted.

05:30.972 --> 05:32.939
And somehow "princess little piddles" was

05:32.974 --> 05:34.941
the name the class picked!

05:34.976 --> 05:36.843
Millie gets her way.

05:36.877 --> 05:38.912
I kind of want her to name me now.

05:38.946 --> 05:41.514
On to campaign strategy...
we've got to up our game.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.750
I can make another poster...
maybe I dot the "I" in "Jimmy"

05:43.784 --> 05:45.418
with a check mark? It's a little wild,

05:45.453 --> 05:46.519
but it just might work.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.921
(Chuckles) That's a good...

05:47.955 --> 05:49.122
That's actually a really good...
- Yeah.

05:49.156 --> 05:50.957
No, no posters... print is dead.

05:50.992 --> 05:52.626
We've got TVs in the classroom.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.361
We need a commercial.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.796
The only thing standing
between us and a Millie-ocracy

05:56.831 --> 06:00.033
is Jimmy Jr.'s dumb pretty face.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.067
Ow.

06:03.638 --> 06:04.704
That's the new knife, huh?

06:04.739 --> 06:05.939
Yeah, it's so responsive.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.340
It's, like, connected to my brain.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.309
I think "chop", and it chops.

06:09.343 --> 06:10.710
Yeah, I got a hammer like that.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.978
Us guys and our tools.

06:12.013 --> 06:13.613
- Chop.
- (Falsetto): Right away, Bob.

06:13.648 --> 06:15.015
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

06:15.049 --> 06:16.650
I think we got enough onions, Bob.

06:16.684 --> 06:18.485
Do I tell you or that car
payment you're holding?

06:18.519 --> 06:20.053
You can tell us both. (Sighs)

06:20.087 --> 06:21.488
It's a McLecklin, my hammer.

06:21.522 --> 06:23.156
You know that brand, Bob? McLecklin?

06:23.190 --> 06:24.958
I don't know hammer brands, Teddy.

06:24.992 --> 06:27.360
They're the best... they're
like the Meryl Streep of hammers.

06:27.395 --> 06:28.795
Ah, look at that slice.

06:28.829 --> 06:30.397
Uh, I'm not crying because of the onions,

06:30.431 --> 06:32.399
I'm crying because it's beautiful.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.834
And it's so thin, I could
actually use it as a tissue.

06:34.869 --> 06:36.569
Ow, ow, that's a bad idea.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.805
I made a video of my hammer pounding nails.

06:38.839 --> 06:40.807
I put a Natalie merchant song under it.

06:40.841 --> 06:42.075
Dedicated it to my dad.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.710
Yeah, but your hammer and my knife...

06:43.744 --> 06:46.479
(chuckling): It's not
really the same thing.

06:46.514 --> 06:47.714
Want to read some of the comments, Bobby?

06:47.748 --> 06:48.982
Uh, I don't... no.

06:49.016 --> 06:50.984
This guy... he says, "nailed it!"

07:22.416 --> 07:23.783
Let's do this!

07:23.818 --> 07:25.018
(Screams)

07:25.052 --> 07:26.720
Oh, barf.

07:26.754 --> 07:28.588
I want to slap that kid.

07:28.623 --> 07:30.156
I know, right? Oh...

07:32.159 --> 07:34.127
I'm Tammy with Wagstaff school news.

07:34.161 --> 07:36.563
Our top story... did a
super lame ad take Jimmy Jr.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.198
From front runner to dumb bummer? (Buzzing)

07:38.232 --> 07:39.733
We got reactions.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.601
I felt like I was covered
in something gross,

07:41.636 --> 07:43.136
and I wanted to burn my eyeballs.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.437
Basically.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.373
I wouldn't braid his hair with your hands.

07:46.407 --> 07:48.308
What a (Bleep). Sorry.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.442
We pooped the bed!

07:49.477 --> 07:50.577
This station is biased.

07:50.611 --> 07:52.245
I'm sure most people liked it.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.448
This just in... Millie's
gained 30 points on Jimmy Jr.

07:55.483 --> 07:56.449
Oh, man.

07:56.484 --> 07:57.450
Okay, a little setback.

07:57.485 --> 07:58.451
Manageable.

07:58.486 --> 07:59.653
Now we know what not to do,

07:59.687 --> 08:01.154
so we go hard the other way.

08:01.188 --> 08:03.156
Hang on, kids, we're going negative.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.958
<i>Gene: It's 3:00 p.m. at
Wagstaff, (Phone rings)</i>

08:04.992 --> 08:06.493
<i>And a telephone is ringing.</i>

08:06.527 --> 08:08.495
<i>The bake sale is out of snicker-doodles.</i>

08:08.529 --> 08:10.930
<i>Maybe that doesn't sound like a big deal,</i>

08:10.965 --> 08:13.500
<i>but it is because some
people really like them.</i>

08:13.534 --> 08:15.502
<i>Who do you want answering the call?</i>

08:15.536 --> 08:17.937
<i>A fourth grader with multiple tardies</i>

08:17.972 --> 08:19.773
<i>and multiple screws loose?</i>

08:19.807 --> 08:22.342
<i>Millie... too dangerous for the bake sale,</i>

08:22.376 --> 08:24.511
<i>too dangerous for Wagstaff.</i>

08:24.545 --> 08:26.446
<i>Vote for Jimmy Jr. maybe.</i>

08:26.480 --> 08:29.416
That was mean. Now I know
who I'm voting for, for sure.

08:29.450 --> 08:31.418
Our big brother is mean?

08:31.452 --> 08:33.419
Is that what we're gonna turn into?

08:33.453 --> 08:34.421
I won't let you.

08:34.455 --> 08:35.655
I'm turning!

08:35.690 --> 08:37.524
Leave before I hurt you!

08:37.558 --> 08:38.924
Oh, boy.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.260
<i>Tammy: I'm here in the studio</i>

08:40.294 --> 08:43.263
with Millie, the victim of a
vicious Jimmy Jr. attack ad.

08:43.297 --> 08:44.664
Girl, how you holding up?

08:44.699 --> 08:46.032
(Sighs) I'm okay.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.100
I'm strong.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.368
I-I have to be strong.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.703
For Wagstaff.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.705
You know what, negativity always backfires.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.007
Jocelyn does it all the time,
and it's lame, and she's lame.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.009
Not to be negative. This
is a great interview.

08:56.043 --> 08:57.344
You know, you're really good at this.

08:57.378 --> 08:58.545
I know, I know I am.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.213
I want to endorse you... can I do that?

09:00.247 --> 09:01.614
Mr. grant is shaking his head "no,"

09:01.649 --> 09:02.615
but I'm doing it.

09:02.650 --> 09:03.850
And I'm getting a new poll.

09:03.884 --> 09:05.285
Oh, my God, you're winning!

09:05.319 --> 09:06.453
Louise, what's going on?

09:06.487 --> 09:07.554
I'm supposed to be ahead.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.555
It's under control.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.190
Tammy just handed us the answer.

09:10.224 --> 09:11.558
Negativity backfires.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.994
Which means it also, uh, "front fires."

09:14.028 --> 09:15.228
Change of strategy.

09:15.262 --> 09:16.296
Posters, on it.

09:16.330 --> 09:17.464
Everybody like bubble letters?

09:17.498 --> 09:19.299
I don't know, they're pretty flashy.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.635
No, we go hard negative against Jimmy Jr.

09:22.670 --> 09:24.204
Huh? What?

09:24.238 --> 09:25.672
Try to keep up, pretty boy.

09:25.706 --> 09:26.873
Wait, what?

09:26.907 --> 09:28.308
Millie gets blamed.

09:28.342 --> 09:29.709
See, it's foolproof.

09:29.744 --> 09:31.144
I'm figuring this crap out, people.

09:31.178 --> 09:32.846
I'm feeling pretty confident now!

09:32.880 --> 09:34.214
(Groans nervously)

09:35.549 --> 09:38.018
Lin, I just cut a grain
of rice into six pieces.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.886
Come look.
- No!

09:39.920 --> 09:42.020
- Teddy, look at what
my Fukinawa and I did.

09:42.070 --> 09:42.750
- Can't, Bob.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.758
I brought my McLecklin in so I
can finish off this birdhouse.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.559
Wait, what? You can't do that here.

09:46.594 --> 09:48.895
We're two guys with tools
we love, making it happen.

09:48.929 --> 09:50.897
Teddy, stop... you don't
compare a stupid hammer

09:50.931 --> 09:52.332
to a Fukinawa knife.

09:52.366 --> 09:53.833
Stupid hammer?

09:53.868 --> 09:55.735
- And your birdhouse.
- Oh, here we go.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.270
Oh, I understand.

09:57.304 --> 09:58.905
I understand that your
weeny grapefruit knife

09:58.939 --> 10:01.107
isn't half the tool my McLecklin is.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.043
Not half! Take that back, Teddy.

10:03.077 --> 10:04.878
I'm not going to. You
know what, we'll settle it.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.680
- Okay, you're on.
- How do we do that?

10:06.714 --> 10:08.682
I don't know, it's probably impossible.

10:08.716 --> 10:11.084
Ugh, you men competing
over your little toys.

10:11.118 --> 10:14.655
The only way I'm gonna care
about this is if I get involved.

10:14.689 --> 10:16.889
Oh, I got it! Knife-hammer olympics

10:16.890 --> 10:18.291
I got to plan the opening ceremonies.

10:18.325 --> 10:20.694
<i>Gene: Wagstaff has questions for Jimmy Jr.</i>

10:20.728 --> 10:22.696
<i>Why does he dance all the time?</i>

10:22.730 --> 10:24.064
<i>What's he hiding?</i>

10:24.098 --> 10:25.732
<i>Does he have to go?</i>

10:25.766 --> 10:28.368
<i>Why doesn't he stop dancing and just go?</i>

10:28.402 --> 10:30.970
<i>Tell Jimmy Jr. to go
to the bathroom already.</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:33.873
<i>By the way, here's his fifth grade picture.</i>

10:33.908 --> 10:35.608
<i>It's terrible!</i>

10:35.878 --> 10:38.478
<i>Paid for by students of
Wagstaff of America for change.</i>

10:38.479 --> 10:40.246
I'm down by 70 points?

10:40.281 --> 10:42.282
No one blamed Millie.

10:42.316 --> 10:44.651
Why won't people just think
what we want them to think?!

10:44.685 --> 10:46.786
You turned Jimmy Jr. From hero to zero!

10:46.821 --> 10:49.456
It's not supposed to go that way!

10:49.490 --> 10:51.558
You took something beautiful,
and tore it to pieces.

10:51.592 --> 10:53.259
I don't even want to
hang out with him anymore!

10:53.294 --> 10:54.928
No, Zeke! No! No!

10:54.962 --> 10:56.329
I'm sorry, Jay-ju!

10:56.364 --> 10:57.430
She wrecked you!

10:57.465 --> 10:58.665
(Crying): Oh, God.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.933
Okay, we double down!

10:59.967 --> 11:01.501
We go after Jimmy Jr. harder.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.969
Nothing's off limits...

11:03.004 --> 11:04.604
the lisp, the weird brothers, dating Tina.

11:04.638 --> 11:06.239
I quit, Louise.

11:06.273 --> 11:07.607
Right, right. Take a break. Okay.

11:07.641 --> 11:08.942
Break's over. Back to work!

11:08.976 --> 11:10.243
Millie said if I dropped out,

11:10.277 --> 11:12.112
she'd let me pick songs at dances.

11:12.146 --> 11:14.014
It's all I wanted anyway.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.115
After all I've done!

11:15.149 --> 11:16.983
Good-bye, Louise!

11:17.018 --> 11:18.084
Ha-ha! (Gasps)

11:18.119 --> 11:19.853
Ready to wear my button, Louise?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.287
Never!

11:21.322 --> 11:22.956
Uh, Henry, hi, uh, hey!

11:22.990 --> 11:24.591
Meet your new campaign manager.

11:24.625 --> 11:25.925
First off, let's ditch those glasses.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.160
Uh, no, thanks.

11:27.194 --> 11:29.095
I've seen what your help can do.

11:29.130 --> 11:31.197
But we've got to stop Millie
from becoming president, Henry!

11:31.232 --> 11:32.932
Then maybe you should run yourself.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.601
You can manage your own campaign.

11:34.635 --> 11:36.770
The combination of you and
you should be unstoppable.

11:36.804 --> 11:38.705
Pretty sure you're being
sarcastic, but you know what?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.440
That's a great idea!

11:40.474 --> 11:42.342
Louise for president, everybody!

11:42.376 --> 11:45.578
Two more ears! Two more ears!

11:47.856 --> 11:49.456
I don't know Louis. Do you really think

11:49.457 --> 11:51.759
You can beat Millie?
- Yes. I'm way behind, but I've got

11:51.793 --> 11:53.493
core grassroots support
from friends and family.

11:53.528 --> 11:55.595
And are you wearing a
freaking Millie button?!

11:55.730 --> 11:58.630
Well, you've been the one
acting crazy lately, not Millie!

11:58.699 --> 12:00.500
Because she's making me act crazy!

12:00.933 --> 12:02.268
That's how good she is!

12:02.362 --> 12:03.569
At least gene is loyal.

12:03.604 --> 12:06.195
And it has nothing to do with
Millie being out of buttons!

12:06.205 --> 12:06.995
Nothing!

12:07.000 --> 12:07.940
Millie: Oh, Louise.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.470
You're so obsessed with me. I mean,

12:09.570 --> 12:12.065
I run for president, you run for president.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.615
Millie, I know you only
want to be president

12:13.649 --> 12:15.217
so you can control people.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.385
Control me!

12:16.419 --> 12:18.153
This election is about Wagstaff.

12:18.187 --> 12:20.856
Let's take the U and the I out of it.

12:20.890 --> 12:23.191
Oh, look, now it spells "lose".

12:23.226 --> 12:25.894
That was in Louise's name
all along and we never saw it!

12:25.928 --> 12:27.562
This is fun. Do "Tina".

12:27.597 --> 12:28.830
Just wait for the debate, Millie.

12:28.865 --> 12:30.065
I'm gonna pin you to the mat.

12:30.099 --> 12:31.400
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

12:31.434 --> 12:32.801
(Whispering): And speaking of pins, Millie,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.970
get any more in or not yet?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.805
Here is how it works.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.540
The knife and the hammer
will perform a series

12:38.574 --> 12:41.343
of parallel tasks designed
to determine the biggest tool.

12:41.377 --> 12:42.811
Better tool.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.546
Bob, you will slice ten tomatoes

12:44.580 --> 12:47.149
while Teddy pounds ten
nails into a board. Go!

12:47.183 --> 12:49.084
- Going pretty fast over here,
- Teddy. Listen to that tone, Bob!

12:49.118 --> 12:50.819
- That's McLecklin, baby!
- Fukinawa's in charge!

12:50.853 --> 12:52.254
- Don't hit your thumb!
- Don't cut off your pinky!

12:52.288 --> 12:53.021
- Done!
- Done!

12:53.070 --> 12:53.555
- Tie!

12:53.556 --> 12:54.589
Round two. Switch stations.

12:54.624 --> 12:56.358
Bob, pry up Teddy's nails.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.593
Teddy, nail Bob's tomatoes
back together and go!

12:58.628 --> 12:59.928
Nail tomatoes?

12:59.962 --> 13:01.263
All right, I took a shot.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.432
It took you a day to think of this?

13:03.466 --> 13:04.700
<i>Frond: The next question</i>

13:04.734 --> 13:05.767
is to Louise.

13:05.802 --> 13:07.035
What makes you best qualified

13:07.070 --> 13:08.103
to be president?

13:08.137 --> 13:09.204
It's pretty simple.

13:09.238 --> 13:10.405
I'm not Millie.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.506
People, Millie doesn't

13:11.541 --> 13:12.941
even want to be president.

13:12.975 --> 13:15.010
She just wants to be in my business.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.078
Live in my head

13:16.112 --> 13:17.212
and attach herself

13:17.246 --> 13:18.280
like a conjoined twin.

13:18.314 --> 13:19.881
Growing out of my side one leg,

13:19.916 --> 13:21.583
one arm, and a head on my head.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.552
Good answer. Thank you.

13:23.586 --> 13:24.619
Uh, okay.

13:24.654 --> 13:26.254
Millie, you have the floor.

13:26.289 --> 13:27.356
You've heard my platform.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.390
I would like to add that

13:28.424 --> 13:29.424
I would increase the budget

13:29.459 --> 13:30.525
for student counseling

13:30.560 --> 13:31.593
so that Louise can get the help

13:31.627 --> 13:33.095
she clearly needs.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.230
The help that I need?! That's like...

13:35.264 --> 13:36.632
I'm also for longer recesses,

13:36.666 --> 13:37.866
a besties system,

13:37.900 --> 13:39.368
and bigger desserts!

13:39.402 --> 13:41.770
Yeah!

13:41.804 --> 13:44.106
Wait. Back up. "A besties system"?

13:44.140 --> 13:45.440
I'm moderating, Louise!

13:45.475 --> 13:47.042
"A besties system"?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.311
"Besties"... it stands
for "buddying-up everyone

13:49.345 --> 13:52.047
with someone to improve
the experience of school."

13:52.081 --> 13:54.249
That's elegant. She's
really good at that stuff.

13:54.284 --> 13:55.617
School's hard. No one should have

13:55.652 --> 13:57.386
to go through it alone.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.887
With an assigned bestie,
you'll have someone

13:58.921 --> 14:00.155
to do homework with,

14:00.189 --> 14:01.390
someone to sit with at lunch.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.791
Someone who knows all your thoughts,

14:02.825 --> 14:05.460
who can finish your sentences! (Laughs)

14:05.495 --> 14:07.496
Here we go! What do you want to bet

14:07.530 --> 14:10.098
Millie assigns herself as my bestie, huh?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.601
Besties will be assigned
alphabetically by first name.

14:12.635 --> 14:14.670
Hey, Zane! You and me, bro!

14:14.704 --> 14:16.271
Huh. Well, who does that put together?

14:16.306 --> 14:18.473
Oh, Louise and Millie. What a surprise!

14:18.508 --> 14:19.608
See, people?

14:19.642 --> 14:20.943
Millie's obsessed!

14:20.977 --> 14:21.977
It's me now.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.946
But tomorrow it might be you!

14:23.980 --> 14:25.814
Or you! Probably not you,

14:25.848 --> 14:27.115
boy sucking on watch.

14:27.150 --> 14:29.685
Oh, Louise, you need a bestie so bad!

14:29.719 --> 14:31.320
Aw, someone give Louise a bestie!

14:31.354 --> 14:32.588
She's so sad.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.956
And that concludes our debate.

14:33.990 --> 14:35.357
I think we know who won.

14:35.391 --> 14:37.192
No questions for me? Seriously?

14:37.226 --> 14:38.493
Oh, didn't see you up there, Henry.

14:38.528 --> 14:39.795
After-debate
hug-shake!

14:39.829 --> 14:41.296
(Groaning)

14:41.331 --> 14:43.498
(Shushing) You'll like being my bestie.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.267
(Whispering): You'll have no choice!

14:45.301 --> 14:46.935
So, after five rounds, we're dead even.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.670
And we accidentally nailed
the board to the counter.

14:48.705 --> 14:50.439
That was bad. Who knew nails were so long?

14:50.473 --> 14:51.840
Hmm. Sorry.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.675
But it gives me an idea for the next event.

14:53.710 --> 14:55.844
Who can make a hole in
the counter first? Go!

14:55.878 --> 14:57.346
Oh, we're really gonna regret this!

14:57.380 --> 14:59.381
I'll fix it later... With my hammer!

14:59.415 --> 15:00.682
No, you won't! You'll never
fix anything with that!

15:00.717 --> 15:02.618
- Yes, I will!
- I'll come back later.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.052
Linda: Bye, Mort!

15:04.087 --> 15:06.021
Hey, kid! Yeah, kid!

15:06.055 --> 15:07.356
You, yeah! Hey, come on, vote for me!

15:07.390 --> 15:09.558
Come on, help a candidate out.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.460
Oh, gross, she's still running.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.895
Don't make eye contact, just keep walking.

15:12.929 --> 15:14.129
I saw you, Jocelyn!

15:14.163 --> 15:15.230
Keep walking, keep walking.

15:15.265 --> 15:17.165
I'm a human being! Look at me!

15:17.200 --> 15:18.533
I'll vote for you, Louise.

15:18.568 --> 15:19.835
Thanks, Andy.

15:19.869 --> 15:21.503
I'm Ollie! Forget it!

15:21.538 --> 15:23.972
Which one am I?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.540
(Groans)

15:25.575 --> 15:26.975
I'm gonna lose.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.777
Oh!

15:29.913 --> 15:31.313
"Follow the braid,

15:31.347 --> 15:33.248
check the files,

15:33.283 --> 15:34.716
what you find

15:34.751 --> 15:37.419
will make you smile."

15:37.453 --> 15:38.820
Maybe someone who wears braids.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.355
Snoop dogg? Follow Snoop Dogg.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.557
I already do.

15:41.591 --> 15:43.659
Mostly retweets and recipes.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.761
(Louise gasps) Braids! Abby!

15:45.795 --> 15:47.563
But how does she figure into this?

15:47.597 --> 15:49.097
Frond (Over intercom):
Attention... all students

15:49.132 --> 15:50.432
to the gymnasium.

15:50.466 --> 15:51.700
Voting for Mill... president

15:51.734 --> 15:53.702
will begin in 15 minutes.

15:53.736 --> 15:55.103
We've got to sneak into frond's office,

15:55.138 --> 15:56.205
and see what he's got on Abby.

15:56.239 --> 15:57.606
Okay, good luck. I have to go

15:57.640 --> 15:59.074
vote for Millie, bye. No, Tina!

15:59.108 --> 16:00.175
I need your help.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.510
I need an extra pair of hands.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.578
You messed up the campaign.

16:02.612 --> 16:03.846
You wouldn't listen to me.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.080
Yes, but party loyalty?

16:05.114 --> 16:07.249
We're both registered belchers.

16:07.283 --> 16:09.051
(Sighs) I am a belcher.

16:09.085 --> 16:11.220
Yay, us! The farty party!

16:12.455 --> 16:13.722
Quick, we'll dig through his files

16:13.756 --> 16:15.224
until we find something!

16:15.258 --> 16:16.525
And we'll dig through his zen garden

16:16.559 --> 16:18.026
until we find enlightenment.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.394
Or a clam.

16:19.429 --> 16:20.562
Look at the size of this file.

16:20.597 --> 16:21.597
That's Abby's?

16:21.631 --> 16:22.698
No, it's yours.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.765
Here's Abby's.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.033
Oh, my God!

16:25.068 --> 16:26.435
This changes everything!

16:26.469 --> 16:28.537
We've got to get down
there before the vote.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.305
What are you doing in my office?

16:30.340 --> 16:31.807
What are you doing in your office?

16:31.841 --> 16:33.242
I came up to get a little rubber thing

16:33.276 --> 16:35.077
for my finger to count votes with so...

16:35.111 --> 16:36.545
I don't have to explain myself!

16:36.579 --> 16:37.713
It's my office!

16:37.747 --> 16:39.147
Oh, we were just leaving.

16:39.182 --> 16:41.116
Get comfortable. You're not going anywhere.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.918
Who-who touched my zen garden?!

16:42.952 --> 16:45.687
It's gonna take me all
afternoon to re-zen that thing.

16:46.653 --> 16:49.411
- Please let us go, Mr. Frond!
- No. Frankly, Louise,

16:49.500 --> 16:51.601
your behavior lately
has been extra erratic.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.669
You need some counseling.

16:52.703 --> 16:54.771
Gosh, Mr. Frond, you're right.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.840
I think I might be on the
verge of a breakthrough.

16:56.874 --> 16:58.508
- Oh, good.
- Breakthrough!

16:58.543 --> 16:59.609
(All yelling)

16:59.644 --> 17:01.711
Damn you for making me run!

17:03.381 --> 17:04.446
We got to wrap this up, Lin. I mean,

17:04.482 --> 17:05.781
it's not great for business.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.517
We totally screwed up the counter.

17:07.551 --> 17:08.685
And nothing's settled. If anything,

17:08.719 --> 17:09.953
we've raised more questions.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.521
I'm gonna say we're still even.

17:11.556 --> 17:12.955
And there's only one thing left.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.023
Knife against hammer!

17:14.058 --> 17:15.191
Hammer against knife!

17:15.226 --> 17:16.693
Metal against metal!

17:16.727 --> 17:17.727
No way. We're-we're done.

17:17.762 --> 17:18.795
A tie is good.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.863
Yeah, Bob loves his knife.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.531
I'd hate to destroy it.

17:21.566 --> 17:23.666
My knife was made with hammers, Teddy.

17:23.701 --> 17:25.868
Hammering would actually
make it stronger, so...

17:25.903 --> 17:27.337
Whatever you want to tell yourself.

17:27.371 --> 17:28.905
I get to go first!

17:28.940 --> 17:30.207
Five second rounds. Go!

17:30.241 --> 17:31.374
Fukinawa, go!

17:31.409 --> 17:32.876
Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

17:32.910 --> 17:34.244
Ding! Hammer time!

17:34.278 --> 17:35.512
Mcleckli

17:35.546 --> 17:37.714
die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

17:37.748 --> 17:39.482
Aah! It's not getting stronger!

17:39.517 --> 17:40.750
Fukinawa!

17:40.785 --> 17:42.586
Teddy, you can stop! It's dead.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.020
We got a winner!

17:44.055 --> 17:45.255
Let me see that thing.

17:45.289 --> 17:48.558
God, I really want a McLecklin.

17:48.593 --> 17:50.360
Ah, good, we're not too late.

17:50.394 --> 17:51.828
Everyone, before you vote,

17:51.862 --> 17:53.496
I have something to say to Millie!

17:53.531 --> 17:55.532
And I want you all to hear it!

17:55.566 --> 17:57.567
Just give up, Louise! I have.

17:57.602 --> 17:59.269
I just want to say to Millie

17:59.303 --> 18:01.338
early congratulations, and you know what?

18:01.372 --> 18:03.106
I think being a bestie will be fun.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.108
Wha-what have you done with Louise?

18:05.142 --> 18:07.177
Oh, by the way, I won't be your bestie.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.079
I'll be Abby's.
- Sorry?

18:09.113 --> 18:11.548
Oh, you didn't know?
Abby's real name is Mabel.

18:11.582 --> 18:13.783
"Mabel" comes between
"Louise" and "Millie."

18:13.818 --> 18:15.752
Your alphabetical rule.

18:15.786 --> 18:17.621
Wait a minute... Abby is Mabel?

18:17.655 --> 18:18.855
Abby's actually a nickname for Mabel, but

18:18.890 --> 18:19.956
no one knows that, so I guess...

18:19.991 --> 18:21.558
I'm not talking to you, Abby!

18:21.592 --> 18:23.026
Oh, okay. Mabel, you still into braiding?

18:23.060 --> 18:25.028
Want to take a whack at this mop?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.796
Do you like French braids or a fishtail?

18:26.831 --> 18:29.366
Hey, you're my bestie, you decide!

18:29.400 --> 18:31.535
Yeah, well, whatever, we still
might end up being besties.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.569
Except we won't. I'll be Abby's.

18:32.603 --> 18:34.437
I mean Mabel's. Whatever.

18:34.472 --> 18:37.073
Whatever. But hey, we can
talk later. Let's vote.

18:37.108 --> 18:38.975
Yeah, let's vote. But
let's talk now for a minute.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.744
Because we will be besties, Louise!

18:40.778 --> 18:43.046
Yeah. But no. Look, it's your rule.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.282
Well, when I'm president, I'll
change the stupid rule, okay?

18:45.316 --> 18:47.050
The new rule will make us besties!

18:47.084 --> 18:48.718
And if it doesn't, I'll change it again!

18:48.753 --> 18:50.487
And I'll change it again!
Because you will be my bestie!

18:50.521 --> 18:54.090
And if I have to get rid of
Abby or Mabel or whoever, I will!

18:54.125 --> 18:56.927
Careful, that's a five-strand braid.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.495
Took me all morning!

18:58.529 --> 19:00.597
Millie!

19:00.631 --> 19:02.766
And... scene! Um...

19:02.800 --> 19:04.301
If elected, I'll-I'll
start an improv club.

19:04.335 --> 19:05.735
Let's do one more. Okay.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.504
Someone throw out a-an, uh, occupation...

19:07.538 --> 19:09.839
And an animal?

19:09.874 --> 19:11.474
I heard fireman?

19:11.509 --> 19:13.443
And pig?

19:13.477 --> 19:14.611
Did somebody say pig?

19:14.645 --> 19:15.912
I think Millie just lost.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.414
Impossible... the only losers

19:17.448 --> 19:19.416
in improv are the audience.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.850
Wait, do we still like her?

19:20.885 --> 19:22.319
We don't, right? She's gross, right?

19:22.353 --> 19:24.421
Millie is disqualified for attacking Abby.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.789
Louise, you were second in the poll.

19:25.823 --> 19:26.957
You're going to be president!

19:26.991 --> 19:28.325
Whew, head rush!

19:28.359 --> 19:31.027
I'm already a little drunk with power!

19:31.062 --> 19:33.830
Louise is disqualified for
breaking into my office.

19:33.865 --> 19:35.098
Oh. So we're out of candidates.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.666
No president this year.

19:36.701 --> 19:37.801
Uh... (Clears his throat)

19:37.835 --> 19:39.336
Oh, wait, Henry Haber.

19:39.370 --> 19:40.770
Congratulations, Henry Haber.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.107
Hi. Uh, today my vote really counted.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.043
In my country, before
the coup, I was president.

19:47.078 --> 19:49.613
You are so freaking lucky, Henry Haber!

19:49.647 --> 19:50.680
(Laughs) Luck.

19:50.715 --> 19:51.848
Is that what you want to call it?

19:51.883 --> 19:53.216
Uh, yeah.

19:53.251 --> 19:54.951
I guess I was just lucky when I figured out

19:54.986 --> 19:56.987
that to get rid of Jimmy Jr.,

19:57.021 --> 19:59.222
<i>I had to lure Millie into the race.</i>

19:59.257 --> 20:01.791
<i>And I guess I was just lucky when I knew</i>

20:01.826 --> 20:04.327
<i>that she would pull you
in on the Jimmy Jr. side,</i>

20:04.362 --> 20:06.296
<i>and that you would tank his campaign.</i>

20:06.330 --> 20:07.998
How could you know that?

20:08.032 --> 20:10.300
A chinchilla named princess
little piddles told me.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.468
What?

20:11.502 --> 20:12.536
My younger brother Hogarth

20:12.570 --> 20:14.204
<i>saw the whole thing.</i>

20:14.238 --> 20:15.839
<i>That name didn't have a chance</i>

20:15.873 --> 20:17.407
<i>till you went overboard dumping on it</i>

20:17.441 --> 20:18.975
<i>because it was Millie's idea.</i>

20:19.010 --> 20:21.645
<i>And all the kids felt bad for her.</i>

20:21.679 --> 20:23.547
Millie makes you completely irrational.

20:23.581 --> 20:24.748
I'm not irrational.

20:24.782 --> 20:27.350
She just drives me totally insane!

20:27.385 --> 20:29.019
Then I had to take care of Millie.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.887
So I got you to run.

20:30.922 --> 20:33.223
<i>Then I helped you take her down in a way</i>

20:33.257 --> 20:34.858
<i>that also took you down.</i>

20:34.892 --> 20:35.926
We were pawns?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.827
I believe you mean "prawns".

20:37.862 --> 20:39.329
You can't be that smart.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.363
Chess I can.

20:40.398 --> 20:41.998
Wow. Brains and brawn...

20:42.033 --> 20:44.334
Is what I would say if
you had the brawn part.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.503
How can you play with
people's lives like that?

20:46.537 --> 20:48.572
Who the hell do you think
you are, Henry Haber?

20:48.606 --> 20:50.173
You're gonna be an amazing president.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.875
I was an amazing president.

20:51.909 --> 20:53.843
What happened? Mmm... coup.
