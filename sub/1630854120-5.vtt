WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:06.832
<i>Previously on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:06.876 --> 00:08.965
To the Bloom sisters.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.836
Barely functional,
but a ton of fun.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.099
<i>You haven't told her
you're sober?</i>

00:12.142 --> 00:13.143
- Not yet.
- When?

00:13.187 --> 00:14.753
- Soon.
- Dr. Reynolds,

00:14.797 --> 00:16.233
I can say without a doubt

00:16.277 --> 00:19.062
that you are the worst patient
I've ever encountered.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.324
Hey, what'd you say
your name was?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.761
- I didn't.
- Hi, my name is Iggy,

00:22.805 --> 00:24.154
<i>and I'm on this app,</i>

00:24.198 --> 00:26.156
<i>because who wants
to go through this awful,</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:28.637
<i>confusing, joyous world alone?</i>

00:44.696 --> 00:45.654
Choo, choo.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.355
- I--
- Hey.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.662
- I wanna help you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.403
Hey, Luna--Luna.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.622
You gotta watch with your eyes, remember?

00:57.666 --> 00:59.059
Not your hands.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.712
Yeah, be careful.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.192
Here, give me that,

01:02.236 --> 01:03.889
you little strawberry thief.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.990
Okay.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.905
Whoa, hey, whoa, now, buster.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.559
Blenders are for big people.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.170
But...

01:23.213 --> 01:25.172
if you watch
those grabby hands--

01:25.215 --> 01:26.521
come here, you.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.913
Rawr.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.133
You can watch from right here.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.527
All right, here we go.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.185
Baby,
that was not a good choice.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.403
Here, give me that.
Let's put that back.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.101
Come here.
You're just making a mess.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.581
Oh, boy, okay. Ooh.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.584
All right, don't,
uh, touch anything, okay?

01:51.154 --> 01:53.330
Owie.
Grabby hand.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.767
Oh, no, no, baby, baby,
baby, come here.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.160
You okay?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.422
You all right?

01:58.466 --> 02:01.251
That's grabby hands.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.731
You know what?

02:02.774 --> 02:04.254
You're coming
with Daddy to work, okay?

02:04.298 --> 02:06.169
Come here. Ooh.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.132
Hey, Nurse.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.959
Trudy, wait up.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.265
Trudy?

02:15.309 --> 02:16.614
Hildegard?

02:16.658 --> 02:18.834
Do I look like
a Hildegard to you?

02:18.877 --> 02:22.142
You're right.
You look more like a... Olga.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.491
Not even close. Mm.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.188
I mean, you could
just tell me your name.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.190
And miss out
on all these crack guesses?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.540
Nah.
- Paloma?

02:29.584 --> 02:30.715
Margarita?

02:30.759 --> 02:33.109
Julep?
- You're just naming cocktails.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.893
I am not.
Harvey Wallbanger?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.417
Yeah,
I think you're just picking up

02:36.460 --> 02:37.983
that I want a cocktail.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.464
Yeah, well, let's make it
happen after work.

02:40.508 --> 02:43.163
Hey, girl,
you are not gonna believe this.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.034
- What?
- They just offered me

02:45.077 --> 02:47.297
a $20,000 bonus if I pack up

02:47.341 --> 02:48.864
and go to
Oklahoma City tonight.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.344
Good for you.

02:50.387 --> 02:53.173
I will meet you there
if the food is halfway decent.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.478
- Deal.
- Okay.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.176
- See you when I see you.
- I'll see you.

02:58.613 --> 03:01.093
So you're a travel nurse?

03:01.137 --> 03:04.140
Yeah, I'm here for eight
weeks and then on to the next.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.493
But you were talking
about after work?

03:11.582 --> 03:14.629
You know what?
I can't.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.588
But I'll see you on the rounds.

03:17.632 --> 03:18.589
Uh--

03:18.633 --> 03:19.721
okay.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.296
You must be as hung over
as I am.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.128
Here.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.348
Hair of the Dog.
- Oh, read my mind.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.576
Make yourself at home.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.882
Uh, I will, 'cause it is.

03:50.926 --> 03:53.972
Oh, yeah?
Mom still paying the rent?

03:56.671 --> 03:58.629
Yeah, when she remembers.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.675
Oh, God.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.851
Man, it is so weird,
Mom forgetting things

04:02.894 --> 04:05.070
'cause she's old,
not because she's hammered.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.116
I know.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.946
Sucks--makes it so much
harder to be mad at her.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.125
You ever think about it?

04:16.168 --> 04:18.954
About what?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.651
Getting clean.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.267
Uh, yeah.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.357
Yeah, sometimes.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.104
Oh, my God.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.106
Hey, do you remember--

04:41.150 --> 04:43.283
you remember when Mom
used to get, like, wasted

04:43.326 --> 04:44.893
and order, like,
8 million dumplings

04:44.936 --> 04:46.721
from that one place?

04:46.764 --> 04:47.722
Yeah?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.073
I want those dumplings.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.818
I say we get trashed,

04:56.861 --> 04:58.385
eat them tonight.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.908
What do you say?

05:01.562 --> 05:03.085
Reclaim our heritage, Lauren.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.350
Yeah, yeah.
I will pick some up

05:07.394 --> 05:09.134
on my way home from work.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.010
I'm, um...

05:16.664 --> 05:18.492
I'm glad you're here.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.366
Us talking, it feels, like, um,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.325
I don't know,
healthy or whatever.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.415
So let's keep talking.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.511
Just two little stitches.

05:37.554 --> 05:40.427
- Cool.
- What do we say?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.342
Thank you, Auntie Lauren.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.518
Oh, you are so welcome.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.563
I don't get to see you enough,
do I, big girl?

05:46.607 --> 05:49.174
Whoa! Whoa.
- Do not grab the scissors.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.960
Good news is we'll be seeing
Auntie Lauren again very soon.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.005
32-year-old woman
with respiratory arrest

05:54.049 --> 05:55.050
on the A train.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.921
Please keep an eye on her.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.663
Now with pulse ox
in low 90s on 100%.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.709
Uh, is that
what I think it is?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.537
Skin that blue, it's gotta be
sodium nitrate poisoning.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.668
I don't think
I've ever seen it before,

06:04.712 --> 06:05.887
it's so rare.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.758
51-year-old
with respiratory collapse.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.195
- On the A train?
- No, 34 West 57th,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.502
fifth floor office.
- Two unrelated cases

06:12.546 --> 06:13.851
of sodium nitrate poisoning?

06:13.895 --> 06:15.505
Yeah, well,
it used to be rare.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.028
65-year-old man

06:17.072 --> 06:18.856
in respiratory arrest.
- I think we get the picture.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.729
Okay, let's get all
three patients to curtains,

06:21.772 --> 06:24.035
and let's start
methylene blue times three.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.217
Guys, if you look out
your window to the left,

06:32.261 --> 06:33.697
you will note some very--

06:33.741 --> 06:36.004
Strange green objects
whizzing by.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.527
Those are what we commonly

06:37.571 --> 06:40.530
refer to as trees!

06:40.574 --> 06:42.053
Those are trees, everybody.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.578
You are officially out
of the city and into the woods!

06:44.621 --> 06:46.362
Whoo!

06:46.406 --> 06:48.538
Yeah!

06:49.931 --> 06:52.063
Now, you know,
I know our little therapy group

06:52.107 --> 06:55.153
is usually hospital bound,
but, um, you know, a good hike,

06:55.197 --> 06:57.852
amigos, that is a therapy
all to itself.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.375
It's unbelievable.
Our connection

06:59.419 --> 07:00.724
to the natural world is just--

07:08.515 --> 07:10.168
So, um--

07:10.212 --> 07:11.256
Anybody reading anything good?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.957
Ah, I see. Interesting.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.567
Yeah, I thought you guys

07:17.611 --> 07:19.177
might like to know
that we are about to drive

07:19.221 --> 07:21.092
right into a fire.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.877
Also, the bridge up ahead
looks like it's out,

07:22.920 --> 07:25.575
and I am definitely
going to crash the car.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.535
Bigfoot!

07:28.578 --> 07:31.102
Bigfoot straight ahead!

07:31.146 --> 07:33.453
All right, okay.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.503
Give me your phones.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.984
Phones, please.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.202
I'm almost done
with this level.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.377
It'll just be a second.
- My friends,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.249
we are going phone-free today.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.686
Oh, my God, you are so mad
with power right now.

07:49.730 --> 07:50.818
Can I have my phone back
if I do my breathing?

07:50.861 --> 07:51.993
Thank you.
Give it.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.999
Thank you.
This is not for me.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.523
It is for you.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.440
There, doesn't that
feel better already?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.322
Have you seen
their ID bracelets?

08:17.366 --> 08:18.498
Yeah.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.456
They all have the same address.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.631
I've been trying
to call the landlord

08:21.675 --> 08:23.241
to let him know
about the exposure,

08:23.285 --> 08:24.721
but I keep getting voicemail.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.854
"Hi there,
you're poisoning your tenants.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.682
Please call me back whenever."
- You try City Health?

08:28.725 --> 08:30.031
Yeah, that would be perfect,

08:30.074 --> 08:32.250
if we needed it dealt with
in ten years' time.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.036
Look, pick a nurse
with a tox background,

08:35.079 --> 08:36.733
and get her over there.
Someone needs to deal with this

08:36.777 --> 08:38.256
before anyone else gets hurt.
- I'll go.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.824
Uh, thanks,
but I think we can find someone

08:40.868 --> 08:42.173
a few ranks down
from Chair of Surgery for this.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.524
Text me the address.
This is some ripe--

08:46.961 --> 08:48.658
Okay.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.792
"Hi, Justine, it's very nice
to see you again.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.184
"Uh, it's totally normal
to be nervous,

08:53.228 --> 08:55.839
"and any questions you have,
just fire away.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.362
I promise I heard 'em all."

08:57.406 --> 09:02.411
I-ay ust-jay ad-hay
un-way estion-quay.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.198
It's Pig Latin.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.812
"Oh, why are you
speaking in Pig Latin?"

09:11.855 --> 09:16.207
Ell-way, ay-may
ids-kay aid-say.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.688
I can help.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.037
My kids did this
for a year once.

09:20.081 --> 09:24.694
Go ahead, hon.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.175
"I'm sorry
about the Pig Latin,"

09:27.218 --> 09:29.612
and, "My kids said

09:29.656 --> 09:34.486
it was good luck."

09:34.530 --> 09:37.664
"And just so you know,
I've resected lung cancers

09:37.707 --> 09:40.144
like yours hundreds of times."

09:40.188 --> 09:42.756
Excuse me, I need
Nurse Andrea Cantwell.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.235
- Okay.
- Sir, you need to step aside.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.889
"No, surgery
is about to begin.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.457
Whatever this is, it can wait."

09:48.500 --> 09:50.067
I'm afraid it can't.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.418
But New Amsterdam already
took responsibility for this!

09:53.462 --> 09:55.812
Okay.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.248
I know you're just
doing your job,

09:57.292 --> 09:58.946
but you're not hearing me, okay?

09:58.989 --> 10:02.079
But--but the hospital...
- "Keep prepping, Ms. Cerrado."

10:02.123 --> 10:03.559
Already took responsibility
for this, okay?

10:03.603 --> 10:04.821
This is not her fault.
- Sir, you need to step aside.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.040
You're not hearing me.
This is not her fault.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.519
Ma'am, you're under arrest.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.086
It's okay.
It's all right.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.088
My husband--someone
needs to call my husband.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.655
I will call him.
The lawyers are on this, okay?

10:12.699 --> 10:14.135
Andrea Cantwell, you have
the right to remain silent.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.571
Our whole legal team
is on this.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.007
Don't worry, okay?
We got you.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.095
You have the right
to an attorney--

10:18.139 --> 10:19.227
Don't worry.
We've got you--I--

10:19.270 --> 10:20.663
If you can't afford
an attorney--

10:20.707 --> 10:23.666
"What the hell is going on?"

10:23.710 --> 10:25.189
Two months ago,
Andrea's patient died.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.106
"Yeah, this is a hospital.
People die."

10:29.150 --> 10:31.065
Well, tell that to the D.A.,
because they're prosecuting her

10:31.108 --> 10:31.848
for murder.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.813
Uh, Ms. Sawhook,
you're running point

10:39.856 --> 10:41.510
on Nurse Andrea Cantwell's

10:41.553 --> 10:43.077
case, right?
- Yup, I drew the short straw.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.428
Great, so you know that
this death was not her fault?

10:46.471 --> 10:48.299
Andrea grabbed
the wrong medication

10:48.343 --> 10:50.214
and injected it
into a patient's IV,

10:50.258 --> 10:51.215
and it killed him.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.608
Sounds like her fault.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.349
Okay, uh,
meds in this hospital

10:54.392 --> 10:56.264
are dispensed
by MedRack machines--

10:56.307 --> 10:57.526
I'm sure you know that--
but sometimes,

10:57.569 --> 10:58.614
they make mistakes, all right?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.876
They don't dispense
enough meds,

10:59.920 --> 11:01.661
or they dispense too many,
and occasionally,

11:01.704 --> 11:04.707
the nurses have to override
these machines

11:04.751 --> 11:07.014
or patients would die.
- Careful, it sounds like

11:07.057 --> 11:08.145
you're admitting liability.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.364
Well, we already did that

11:09.407 --> 11:10.539
the first time
this went to court.

11:10.582 --> 11:13.020
Okay, HCC admitted
that this machine

11:13.063 --> 11:14.282
that every hospital
in America uses,

11:14.325 --> 11:16.110
made a mistake, all right?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.502
That's not on the nurses.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.461
That's on the entire
American healthcare system.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.116
That was in civil court.
This is a criminal charge.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.813
Andrea's not a criminal.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.510
She was doing her job.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.817
And the only reason that
this D.A. is pursuing this case

11:27.861 --> 11:29.732
is because it makes
for a great headline,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.516
and now it's open season
on nurses.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.475
But it's your responsibility
to protect--

11:33.518 --> 11:34.694
What's your job again?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.741
- Medical director.
- Well, this is no longer

11:38.785 --> 11:40.134
a medical problem.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.925
Sorry,
these stairs are off-limits.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.667
My hip hasn't let me
take those stairs in a decade.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.279
What's all this?
- This is, uh, rat poison

11:55.323 --> 11:56.803
laced with sodium nitrate.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.805
Yeah, no store brand
would have that--

11:58.848 --> 12:01.503
only cheap, basement-made crap
someone got off the internet

12:01.546 --> 12:03.287
to save a buck.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.594
Yeah, your landlord
was reckless, stingy,

12:05.637 --> 12:07.335
and damn lucky no one died.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.163
That's this building for you.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.687
Every day, something like this.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.211
Every day,
something like mass poisoning?

12:14.255 --> 12:15.822
Wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.262
- Try me.
- There was black mold

12:21.305 --> 12:25.092
in the bathroom.
Now I have severe asthma.

12:25.135 --> 12:28.356
There was asbestos
in my floors, in the walls.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.838
Now my G.I. tract is shot.

12:31.881 --> 12:35.624
Roaches in the food,
in the sheets.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.669
My ma got gastroenteritis.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.324
- Spiders.
- Water damage.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.892
- Sewage.
- Oh, New Amsterdam's great.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.111
You did such a good job

12:44.154 --> 12:45.590
when all those people here
got poisoned.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.941
He means the last time
people got poisoned.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.552
The furnace was out,
so everyone used gas ovens.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.555
No vents, carbon monoxide--
it was awful.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.383
Lucky for us,
our window was broken,

12:55.426 --> 12:57.037
so we just got hypothermia.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.778
And pigeons.

13:01.824 --> 13:05.045
All right,
does everybody have water?

13:05.088 --> 13:06.611
Sunscreen?
How 'bout hats

13:06.655 --> 13:07.787
to keep your heads
from exploding when you see

13:07.830 --> 13:10.790
the sheer beauty
of Bear Mountain?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.922
I, for one,
am not doing courtesy laughs

13:12.966 --> 13:14.750
until I get my phone back.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
Okay, fair enough--
gives me an opportunity

13:16.491 --> 13:18.058
to improve my material.
No big deal.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.668
It's not funny.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.583
You're punishing us, and we
didn't even do anything wrong.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.325
Come on.
Are you serious?

13:24.368 --> 13:25.892
This is not a punishment,
you guys.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.850
I'm not punishing you.
This is a gift.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.026
I am giving you
the gift of nature.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.507
Cell phone overusage,
social media, all that stuff,

13:32.550 --> 13:33.769
those are harmful things.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.597
It's like the early days
of cigarettes.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.120
People would run around
like a bunch of dum-dums,

13:37.164 --> 13:39.427
addicted to the things,
had no idea the damage

13:39.470 --> 13:41.081
they were doing
to their own bodies, right?

13:41.124 --> 13:42.909
And what about the Snapchat
thing this morning?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.780
Some kid died
doing a Snapchat challenge.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.390
That's awful.
- Okay, the kid jumps

13:46.434 --> 13:49.741
out of a car--a speeding car--
because someone on Snapchat

13:49.785 --> 13:50.655
told him to?

13:50.699 --> 13:51.874
Yeah, he's got bigger problems

13:51.918 --> 13:53.876
than things on the internet.
We're not morons.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.660
Our phones aren't,
like, damaging us.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.880
Mm-hmm, says the kid
who falls asleep in class,

13:57.924 --> 14:00.752
'cause he's up all night
texting with his buddies.

14:00.796 --> 14:03.886
And Skyla, when we first met,
you painted our entire art wall

14:03.930 --> 14:05.757
with a beautiful,
gorgeous mural.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.934
And now your folks tell me you
won't pick up a brush anymore,

14:07.977 --> 14:10.284
because you're too busy
watching other people paint

14:10.327 --> 14:12.547
on YouTube.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.331
- It's fun to watch.
- I know it's fun to watch,

14:14.375 --> 14:16.464
but watching is not doing.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.031
It's not the same thing,
you know?

14:18.074 --> 14:20.294
And I'm not picking on you.
I'm talking about everyone.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.817
This is everywhere.
Like, Austin,

14:21.861 --> 14:25.081
why did you have to
have thumb surgery again?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.909
I played too much "Fortnite."

14:26.953 --> 14:29.694
Yeah, you played
too much "Fortnite."

14:29.738 --> 14:31.958
Yeah, and Bizzie, you spent
half the damn ride up here

14:32.001 --> 14:33.307
trading seats with everyone,
trying to find

14:33.350 --> 14:35.135
the perfect lighting
for a selfie.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.571
There's only one person here

14:36.614 --> 14:40.053
who has their phone
on them 24/7.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.837
That's--okay,
that's totally different.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.926
I am a doctor, and I'm on call.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.537
I didn't hear any calls.
But back in the van,

14:46.581 --> 14:49.018
I did see a lot
of push notifications.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.718
Me too.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.590
My mom has that same app.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.201
Uh, she says
it's for professional singles.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.164
Okay, yeah, all right.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.687
Uh,

15:05.730 --> 15:07.907
you know what, guys?
You know what? You're right.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.386
You're right.
I'm not being fair.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.824
Mm-kay?
I got a solution though.

15:13.651 --> 15:17.046
There, now nobody gets a phone.
Okay?

15:17.090 --> 15:19.353
No phones for anybody--none.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.485
What do you think?

15:21.529 --> 15:24.358
Guys, calm down.
It's a 90-minute hike.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.534
I think you'll survive.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.014
All right.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.363
Let's go.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.887
Let's get that heart rate up
and blood pumpin'.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.541
Yeah.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.551
Nurse Banner just quit
in the middle of a shift?

15:43.594 --> 15:45.335
She's the fourth one today.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.644
"So I've got room in my O.R.

15:49.687 --> 15:50.993
"for the pulmonary
sleeve lobectomy.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.473
"It's a really
challenging procedure,

15:52.516 --> 15:54.388
but one you'll need to master
to make your careers."

15:54.431 --> 15:57.434
- No, thank you.
- I'll pass.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.870
Mm!

16:00.307 --> 16:01.961
"Okay,
it's a major opportunity.

16:02.004 --> 16:06.530
You're both just--
you're not interested?"

16:06.574 --> 16:09.490
Or we don't want
to end up in handcuffs.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.236
Um, can I see that?

16:20.109 --> 16:24.070
Hey, um, why was a CT ordered
for kidney stones?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.506
I mean, here's the X-ray.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.160
If Andrea wasn't protected
by MedRack,

16:27.203 --> 16:29.249
you think anyone's gonna be
protected by X-rays?

16:32.295 --> 16:33.775
Excuse us. Thank you.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.083
- Max!
- Max!

16:37.126 --> 16:38.998
Excuse me.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.044
"I just had to cancel
multiple procedures.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.438
Because of Andrea,
everyone is in a panic."

16:44.481 --> 16:46.831
I spent years trying to take
the fear out of medicine.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.833
Now we're back to square one.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.922
"This is not square one.
This is worse.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.968
"We are not treating anyone.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.275
"This place has ground
to a halt.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.799
What are we gonna do?"

17:02.238 --> 17:04.501
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.633
- You're in a hurry.
- Yeah,

17:05.676 --> 17:06.721
I'm headed to legal.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.592
I need to learn
about housing law.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.811
Okay, spill it.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.465
You and that building,
what's this about?

17:11.508 --> 17:14.250
It's about your sodium
nitrate victims who were just

17:14.294 --> 17:15.556
discharged
to an apartment building

17:15.599 --> 17:17.558
that's gonna make them sick
all over again.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.561
Hey, where are you going?
- I am having a bonding night

17:20.604 --> 17:23.259
with my sister,
which involves picking up

17:23.303 --> 17:25.435
our favorite
childhood dumplings.

17:25.479 --> 17:26.958
Oh, okay,
so you're still pretending

17:27.002 --> 17:28.090
to be a party-goer
to impress her?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.265
No, I think
what you're asking is

17:29.309 --> 17:30.962
if I'm still using
unconventional methods

17:31.006 --> 17:33.617
to form a therapeutic alliance
with my addict sister.

17:33.661 --> 17:34.966
No, I definitely meant
the first thing.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.359
Have you asked out
that nurse yet?

17:36.403 --> 17:37.882
Uh, no,
it's not gonna work out.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.710
That didn't stop
you and Malvo.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.625
- Tell your sister the truth.
- Ask out the nurse.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.974
- Agree to drop both things?
- Yes.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.150
All right.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.198
District Attorney Belber,
Max Goodwin.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.721
Thanks so much for coming in.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.027
Ah, well, almost in.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.637
Is this usually
where you greet your guests?

17:53.681 --> 17:56.292
Just the ones who
persecute hardworking nurses.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.685
If it's all the same,
I'd rather not let a fox

17:57.728 --> 17:59.252
into a henhouse.
- I figured that's what this

17:59.295 --> 18:00.775
is about.
Now, look.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.603
I'm glad that you reached out.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.040
Bringing criminal charges
against medical personnel

18:05.084 --> 18:06.476
is new ground,
and I want you to know

18:06.520 --> 18:08.348
where I'm coming from.
- Great, I appreciate that.

18:08.391 --> 18:09.479
I'd love to know
where you're coming from,

18:09.523 --> 18:11.133
'cause right now,
I don't see it.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
Do you know what an M&M is?
It's a conference

18:13.179 --> 18:14.484
that we have
after a patient dies.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.051
And doctors and nurses
get together

18:16.095 --> 18:17.618
to have a candid discussion

18:17.661 --> 18:20.142
about everything
that we could've done better.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.752
We look mistakes
right in the eye,

18:21.796 --> 18:23.798
because that's how you learn.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.627
And if admitting a mistake
means life in prison,

18:26.670 --> 18:28.716
just how candid do you think
people are gonna be?

18:28.759 --> 18:31.153
So it's your position that
medical deaths should be immune

18:31.197 --> 18:32.633
to criminal charges?
- No.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.330
If a surgeon operates drunk,
throw 'em in jail.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.419
But when a nurse does
everything possible

18:36.463 --> 18:38.987
to save a life
in the face of dire illness

18:39.030 --> 18:40.162
and a malfunctioning machine,

18:40.206 --> 18:41.729
then maybe cut her some slack.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.600
You know, I heard the same
line from the police union.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.472
Do you think I should stop
prosecuting wrongful deaths

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
with the NYPD too?
- Look, our nurse didn't

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
pull a trigger.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.174
She made the best decision
she could at the time

18:52.218 --> 18:54.133
under the circumstances.
And the truth is

18:54.176 --> 18:56.352
it could've happened
to either one of us.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.267
It was great
talking with you.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.877
Do you hear how quiet it is?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.883
We had to stop
taking ambulances,

19:05.927 --> 19:08.712
because it's gridlock in there.
Do you know why?

19:08.756 --> 19:11.846
Because our nurses
are quitting.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.195
Everyone is afraid.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.198
Please.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.722
Let Andrea go home to her kids.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.073
She will.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.250
Ten years.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.556
She already took a plea.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.609
Why is nature therapeutic?

19:35.652 --> 19:37.437
What is the point
of this activity?

19:39.874 --> 19:42.093
All right, guys, I know
we got off to a rough start

19:42.137 --> 19:44.095
with the phones and all that,
but hey,

19:44.139 --> 19:45.749
look around you.
Take a look around.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.405
Look at the wind blowing
through the trees, you know?

19:49.449 --> 19:50.711
Look at the leaves
dancing in the wind.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.148
Feel that air.
Feel the crispness.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.584
Right?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.282
These are all tactile
sensations that you can use

19:56.325 --> 19:57.413
to bring yourself
back to the moment.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.633
Where's the trail?

19:59.676 --> 20:00.764
Where's the--

20:00.808 --> 20:02.026
oh.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.203
Uh...
- Well, we were so busy

20:04.246 --> 20:05.334
looking at leaves.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.211
I think it's that way.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.909
No, no, it's, uh--

20:14.952 --> 20:18.391
no, I think it's over there.
- Was it that steep?

20:20.175 --> 20:22.351
Dr. Frome, are we lost?

20:22.395 --> 20:24.005
What?

20:24.048 --> 20:27.661
No.
Um, no, we just, uh--

20:29.010 --> 20:31.404
We just need...

20:33.710 --> 20:35.016
A sign.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.410
There we go--a sign, guys.
Come on, follow me.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.675
They must've put these here
for this exact reason.

20:41.718 --> 20:42.676
Huh?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.853
All right,
let's see what we got here.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.161
What's it say?

21:05.699 --> 21:07.004
"BP's low.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.354
She needs Levophed."
- I know.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.401
"She needs Levophed now!

21:12.445 --> 21:13.663
What the hell
are you waiting for?"

21:13.707 --> 21:16.492
The MedRack's refusing
to dispense the med.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.102
"How long have you been

21:18.146 --> 21:19.843
waiting?"
- Six minutes.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.193
"Override the machine now.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.675
If we don't act,
she's gonna die."

21:25.719 --> 21:27.286
I have kids.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.026
If I go to jail,
they'll have nobody.

21:30.463 --> 21:31.725
- Get out of the way!
- Get out.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.335
Elizabeth...

21:33.379 --> 21:35.946
Elizabeth, if you do this,
it's on you.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.394
Come on, come on.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.532
Mm!

21:56.576 --> 21:57.881
"Let's get her to the O.R.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.972
for a Left Ventricular
Assist Device, please."

22:02.016 --> 22:03.757
Was it the wrong med?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.454
"It was the right med.

22:05.498 --> 22:07.369
We just waited too long
to use it."

22:18.337 --> 22:19.816
I spoke to your landlord,

22:19.860 --> 22:21.514
and--hang on to your hat--

22:21.557 --> 22:24.734
Mr. Palumbo's prepared to fix
every problem in this building.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.519
- He will?
- Yup, he's gonna clean up

22:26.562 --> 22:29.652
all the black mold.
The asbestos in the walls?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.350
Gone.
- And in the ceiling?

22:31.393 --> 22:32.699
And in the ceiling.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.527
Hey, while we're at it,
how does an exterminator

22:34.570 --> 22:36.616
for the cockroaches sound?
- It's about time.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.313
Like you forgot the spiders.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.489
Oh, no, no, no.
He'll deal with the spiders.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.013
He'll deal with the rats.
He'll upgrade the furnaces.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.754
He'll fix your windows.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.756
He'll deal with the pigeons.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.236
Right?
He's gonna repair

22:48.279 --> 22:50.194
what's broken,
replace what's busted,

22:50.238 --> 22:53.284
and get this place
back up to code.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.721
How?

22:54.764 --> 22:58.115
Yeah, um,
so just hear me out.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.596
He will need
to increase your rent by 50%.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.252
- Raise it?
- This is illegal.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.775
- We have a lease.
- Are you kidding me?

23:05.819 --> 23:07.821
- Oh, I signed a contract.
- Hey, easy now.

23:07.864 --> 23:08.909
Do you think
we're made of money?

23:08.952 --> 23:10.084
- Ridiculous.
- Come on.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.172
Easy now.
Hey, I said hear me out,

23:11.215 --> 23:13.000
remember?

23:13.043 --> 23:15.350
Yes, it sucks that
you'll be paying more money.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.439
But hey, that's already money
you're spending every month

23:17.483 --> 23:20.050
on medical bills, right?
And on lost wages

23:20.094 --> 23:21.617
from missing work
when you're sick.

23:21.661 --> 23:23.140
I mean,
once this place is safer,

23:23.184 --> 23:25.316
those expenses vanish.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.188
Big picture,
you're breaking even.

23:27.231 --> 23:31.366
Only now, you have
a safe and livable building.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.933
Right?
What do you think about that?

23:32.976 --> 23:34.108
- No way.
- No, thank you.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.284
- Hell no.
- I think it sounds awful.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.678
- No, no.
- I don't--I don't get it.

23:38.721 --> 23:39.766
Mm-mm.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.115
I missed "Blue Bloods"
for this?

23:41.158 --> 23:42.508
I mean,
I really don't get it.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.814
You won't lose a dollar,
and you'd fix the building.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.469
That's right. <i>
We'd</i> fix it.

23:47.513 --> 23:51.038
Maybe higher rents would cost
the same as our medical bills,

23:51.081 --> 23:53.867
but we shouldn't have either.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.738
This is
the owner's responsibility.

23:55.782 --> 23:56.783
Not ours.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.751
Footprints!

24:08.795 --> 24:09.970
What?
Yes.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.362
Oh, yes!
Yes, Bizzie,

24:11.406 --> 24:13.800
you wonderful woods woman, you!

24:13.843 --> 24:15.976
Very nicely done. Okay.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.325
Okay!
Guys, what have I been saying?

24:17.368 --> 24:19.370
I said if we keep calm,
keep our eyes peeled,

24:19.414 --> 24:20.981
and we stick together,
we will get out of here

24:21.024 --> 24:21.895
in one piece, right?
- I think these

24:21.938 --> 24:23.505
are our footprints.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.898
Hmm?

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
No, no,
I don't think that's true.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.989
No, see the weird
worm thing in the middle?

24:29.032 --> 24:31.034
Those are Austin's shoes.

24:31.078 --> 24:32.819
I don't think
they look like worms.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.345
Uh...

24:37.388 --> 24:40.827
okay, okay, okay.
Yeah, um, okay, so

24:40.870 --> 24:43.438
we know that we've been walking
around in circles, right?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
That's good in a way.
That's a clue, right?

24:45.135 --> 24:47.834
We know now more than we did
five seconds ago.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.966
We do not wanna
keep going that way.

24:50.010 --> 24:54.101
We wanna go one of,
um, uh, the other...

24:57.191 --> 24:58.714
Ways.
- Wait,

24:58.758 --> 25:01.630
my dad said moss only grows
on the north side of trees.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.328
Oh, Lev, yes.
Amazing!

25:04.372 --> 25:05.591
Yeah, okay,
everybody come on over here.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.244
Guys, come on.
Come check out the moss

25:07.288 --> 25:08.550
over here.
We, uh--

25:13.860 --> 25:15.078
Moss sucks.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.341
North is not every direction, moss.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.997
Uh, Dr. Frome, I'm cold.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.129
Yeah, I know you are, bud.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.522
I know.
Me too.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.698
Um, sorry about that.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.047
You know,
if these clouds

25:27.090 --> 25:29.049
weren't so dang thick,
we could use the shadows

25:29.092 --> 25:31.355
from the trees
as, like, a sundial, you know?

25:31.399 --> 25:34.141
Get our direction that way.
- Those clouds look scary.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.712
Oh, don't--don't worry
about the clouds, okay?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.589
Dr. Frome, it's raining.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.243
Yeah, I'm aware, Skyla.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.419
Thank you.

25:51.462 --> 25:54.161
Okay, uh, guys, find cover.
Find cover.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.162
Come on.
Go, go, go.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.033
Find cover. Go.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.078
Okay,

25:58.121 --> 25:59.079
backs up against the tree.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.689
Dr. Frome, my dad told me

26:00.733 --> 26:02.125
never go under trees
when there's lightning.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.874
Hey, Doc.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.920
"How are you feeling?"

26:13.963 --> 26:15.530
Glad to be alive

26:15.574 --> 26:18.098
and able to speak
in normal English

26:18.141 --> 26:21.188
instead of Pig Latin.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.500
What is it?

26:31.459 --> 26:33.026
"There's been
a complication."

26:36.159 --> 26:37.944
The delay
in Justine Cerrado's care

26:37.987 --> 26:41.338
caused permanent kidney damage.
She'll need a transplant,

26:41.382 --> 26:46.692
and, um, her life will have
limits it did not have before.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.564
But hey, legally speaking,
we're in the clear.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.567
We were just
double-checking medications.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.005
We were just, uh,
being prudent.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.575
We were just covering our ass.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.405
Guys, I can't invent
a better MedRack.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.494
I can't fend off the D.A.
They could come after you

27:06.537 --> 27:09.802
for an honest mistake,
and I can't protect you.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.197
But if we're putting our
welfare ahead of the welfare

27:14.241 --> 27:17.679
of our patients...

27:17.723 --> 27:19.376
then we failed.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.945
We might as well
shut the doors,

27:22.989 --> 27:25.687
because patients first

27:25.731 --> 27:29.691
is the only way
I know how to do this.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.215
And if you can't do that,
then, uh...

27:35.218 --> 27:36.567
Then you should quit.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.836
And with everything
that's happening,

27:43.879 --> 27:45.141
I wouldn't blame you.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.627
Soup dumplings and memories

27:52.671 --> 27:54.760
of our mother's
inebriated past.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.413
Get 'em while they're hot.

27:56.457 --> 27:59.286
Ah, these are, like, 95% MSG,

27:59.329 --> 28:02.550
but they smell incredible.

28:12.168 --> 28:13.300
Vanessa...

28:14.954 --> 28:17.565
Three years sober...

28:17.608 --> 28:20.002
Wow, that's, um,

28:20.046 --> 28:21.351
that's impressive.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.833
Get out.
- Stop it.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.836
What--okay, look,
can we just talk about this?

28:27.880 --> 28:29.229
So I'm sober, who cares?

28:29.272 --> 28:31.753
Who cares?
You've been lying to me

28:31.797 --> 28:33.102
this whole time, Lauren!

28:33.146 --> 28:34.495
I mean, what are you
even doing here?

28:34.538 --> 28:36.845
Coming here to, like,
deprogram me or something?

28:36.889 --> 28:38.760
Acting like we're best friends
all of a sudden

28:38.804 --> 28:41.241
when you've been lying
to my face the whole time!

28:41.284 --> 28:42.895
I'm sorry.
Why is my sobriety

28:42.938 --> 28:44.897
any of your business?

28:44.940 --> 28:46.115
I mean, you only know about it

28:46.159 --> 28:47.726
because you went
through my stuff.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.990
Yeah, in my house!
I was looking for Adderall!

28:51.033 --> 28:52.252
I mean--

28:52.295 --> 28:53.906
Classic druggie sister, right?

28:53.949 --> 28:55.821
What will she do next?

28:55.864 --> 28:58.301
Vanessa!

28:58.345 --> 29:00.303
Okay, can you just--
please, can you just stop?

29:00.347 --> 29:02.305
- Get out of my way!
- I'm sorry!

29:02.349 --> 29:03.437
I don't ever
wanna speak to you again.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.917
I lied, I lied!
Okay?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.962
I'm a liar!
But this--us?

29:07.006 --> 29:09.225
This is not fake!
You know that!

29:09.269 --> 29:11.314
Just--can you just
tell me what I can do

29:11.358 --> 29:12.359
to fix this?
- I'm sorry, Lauren.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.621
I haven't read your A.A. book.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.362
I don't know
which step this is, exactly.

29:15.405 --> 29:16.798
- You're not a step.
- You're just using me

29:16.842 --> 29:19.322
to make yourself feel better
about your sad life,

29:19.366 --> 29:21.194
about the crap
you pulled when I was a kid.

29:21.237 --> 29:24.632
- No, I love you.
- You left me, Lauren--

29:24.675 --> 29:28.810
with our psychotic mother
when I was nine!

29:28.854 --> 29:31.813
Do you have any idea
how much worse things got

29:31.857 --> 29:33.641
after you were gone?

29:33.684 --> 29:36.862
I mean, literally.
Do you have any idea?

29:39.125 --> 29:40.256
Right.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.172
Get out.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.349
Pick those up.
You--

29:48.134 --> 29:49.222
Pick those up!

29:57.578 --> 30:00.015
I was an 18-year-old
runaway drug addict.

30:00.059 --> 30:03.018
And yeah, it sucks
that you couldn't come with me,

30:03.062 --> 30:05.847
but I couldn't
take care of you.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.110
And the real villain
of your life is Mom.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.330
It's not me.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.679
And now it's you.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.333
It's you
and your terrible choices,

30:13.376 --> 30:15.161
like the one
you're making right now,

30:15.204 --> 30:16.945
acting like
I somehow betrayed you,

30:16.989 --> 30:19.687
when what I am doing is
easily one of the nicest things

30:19.730 --> 30:21.341
anyone's ever done for you.
- Oh!

30:21.384 --> 30:23.822
Right, okay.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.084
Where are you going?

30:25.127 --> 30:26.520
- To get high.
- Oh, yeah, great.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.174
Hurt yourself
to get revenge on me.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.523
Go right ahead.
- Yup.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.524
Wait, Nessa, wait.
I didn't mean it.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.308
Just--
- Know what, Lauren?

30:32.352 --> 30:34.397
You wanna live here so bad?
Fine.

30:34.441 --> 30:35.659
Go right ahead.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.183
Nessa!

30:47.671 --> 30:50.631
Hey.

31:44.511 --> 31:47.731
- Hey, Dr. G.
- Um, uh,

31:47.775 --> 31:49.385
sorry.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.604
Just expected it to be

31:50.647 --> 31:53.520
a lot less
full of people who work here.

31:53.563 --> 31:56.349
Did you consolidate?
- I didn't have to.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.655
Nobody left.

31:58.699 --> 32:01.484
None of us got into this
business to cover our asses.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.242
You guys said this place
needs a better owner--

32:20.286 --> 32:22.766
someone who cares about it
as much as you do

32:22.810 --> 32:25.682
and who's willing to do
what it takes to keep it up.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.946
Well, I found them.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.819
- Who?
- You.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.518
Actually, all of you.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.607
- Some sort of joke?
- I can't afford a studio,

32:37.651 --> 32:39.870
never mind a whole building.
- This is ridiculous.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.220
Come on, Gabe.
- Hey, hang on.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.873
Let me explain.
New Amsterdam's gonna loan you

32:42.917 --> 32:45.398
the money--below market rate--

32:45.441 --> 32:48.009
to convert this place
into a co-op.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.273
That way,
you can all be owners.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.275
And why would
a hospital do that?

32:53.319 --> 32:56.539
Well, the short term is
it's a huge tax write-off.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.455
Long term, you guys
are all such frequent flyers

32:59.499 --> 33:02.806
that if we get you healthy,
we'll actually come out ahead.

33:02.850 --> 33:07.550
But the monthly cost of each
unit will increase by 50%.

33:07.594 --> 33:08.812
It has to.
- Yeah, we know.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.771
We already told you
we didn't want that.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.860
Why on God's green Earth
do you think any of us

33:12.903 --> 33:14.122
would pay
that much more in rent?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.298
'Cause it's not rent.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.344
It's a mortgage.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.389
So instead of giving
your money away,

33:20.433 --> 33:23.305
you'll be investing
in your future.

33:23.349 --> 33:26.178
If you own,
the only thing limiting you

33:26.221 --> 33:28.441
is how hard
you're willing to work.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.486
You wanna fix something?

33:30.530 --> 33:32.532
Do it.

33:32.575 --> 33:35.491
You can actually make this
place what you want it to be.

33:35.535 --> 33:38.016
You know why?
Because you own it.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.585
It's yours.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.808
I've been dreaming
of fixing up this place

33:47.851 --> 33:49.766
for 41 years.

33:52.334 --> 33:56.686
Lobby party.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.559
Yes, lobby!

34:09.047 --> 34:11.962
This wasn't just for us,
was it now?

34:12.006 --> 34:14.052
Well,

34:14.095 --> 34:16.097
we all deserve a good home.

34:25.324 --> 34:28.501
Wow, where did you learn
to build a fire like this?

34:28.544 --> 34:30.111
YouTube.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.201
That's impressive.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.551
Tell my parents.

34:36.900 --> 34:37.814
They're still mad
about what I did

34:37.858 --> 34:39.729
to the side of the garage.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.948
Right.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.650
Well, guys, I am--

34:47.694 --> 34:49.348
I am so sorry.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.960
I am so, so sorry.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.180
You know,
phones are a nightmare.

34:55.223 --> 34:59.488
They are a brain-damage-causing
actual nightmare.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.882
But, uh,

35:01.925 --> 35:03.405
taking them away like that...

35:05.407 --> 35:07.670
Yeah, that's not cool.
It's a therapist's job

35:07.714 --> 35:10.108
to help people cope,

35:10.151 --> 35:11.544
and I basically asked you guys

35:11.587 --> 35:14.112
to stick your fingers
in your ears

35:14.155 --> 35:16.026
and pretend
that phones don't exist.

35:17.550 --> 35:21.249
That's not therapy.
That's, um...

35:21.293 --> 35:24.122
that's, like,
scared-old-guy territory.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.126
Yeah.

35:28.169 --> 35:31.607
You know, and obviously,
phones aren't all bad.

35:31.651 --> 35:34.784
For example,
you can use them to call 911

35:34.828 --> 35:35.698
when you're lost.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.486
Bingo, Bizzie.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.531
Yeah.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.794
You know, what I'm really
apologizing for, though,

35:44.838 --> 35:49.886
is not for taking your phones
away or for getting us

35:49.930 --> 35:53.194
hopelessly lost in the woods.

35:53.238 --> 35:55.631
It's for not respecting
that you guys have

35:55.675 --> 35:59.635
more than enough character
and fortitude to handle

35:59.679 --> 36:02.682
anything that cell phones and
social media can throw at you.

36:04.727 --> 36:07.295
I mean, look at you guys.
Look at this.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.428
We're soaking wet.
We're lost in the woods,

36:09.471 --> 36:12.474
and you're not panicking--

36:12.518 --> 36:14.824
not even a little bit.
You're lighting fires,

36:14.868 --> 36:18.741
and you're being cool as
a bunch of cucumbers, you know?

36:18.785 --> 36:20.003
I'm proud of you.

36:25.705 --> 36:26.619
What was that?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.144
A bird, maybe,
or something like that--

36:30.188 --> 36:31.754
Austin, what was that?

36:33.582 --> 36:34.583
My iPad.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.150
Austin,
what is wrong with you?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.847
- Why would you hide that?
- You had it this whole time?

36:37.891 --> 36:39.197
He said phones.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.937
Give it to me.
Give me the iPad.

36:40.981 --> 36:43.766
- Okay.
- Hand it over.

36:43.810 --> 36:44.811
Thank you.

36:56.301 --> 37:00.218
Okay, all right,
we're good to go.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.045
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.134
Oh, my gosh, Austin.

37:11.751 --> 37:12.839
Gabrielle

37:12.882 --> 37:15.102
is my name.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.234
Gabrielle.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.368
All right.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.892
I'm gonna get
one of those fancy drinks

37:22.936 --> 37:25.155
you were talking about earlier.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.809
You still out?

37:37.124 --> 37:38.212
Yeah.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.388
Yeah, I'm still out.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.824
Are you one of those doctors

37:41.868 --> 37:43.435
that think you're too good
for nurses, or--

37:43.478 --> 37:45.132
No, no, no.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.830
No, uh, I'm just one of those

37:47.874 --> 37:51.399
doctors who's pushing 40,

37:51.443 --> 37:52.835
and I'm nowhere near
where I thought I'd be

37:52.879 --> 37:54.184
outside this hospital.

37:55.925 --> 37:58.101
I'm looking for something
more permanent.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.973
Mm.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.845
You know, and
I have been for a long time.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.241
How is that going for you?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.853
So bad.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.639
So bad,
you wouldn't believe it.

38:13.682 --> 38:18.252
See?
Maybe you have just been

38:18.296 --> 38:19.819
going about it all wrong.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.342
How is that?

38:21.386 --> 38:24.040
All I'm gonna say is

38:24.084 --> 38:28.131
it's surprising how much fun
you can have in eight weeks.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.490
Yeah?

38:40.143 --> 38:41.101
Yeah.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.631
You know what?

38:49.675 --> 38:53.461
I think I owe you and
your grabby hand an apology,

38:53.505 --> 38:56.464
because this morning,
when I was trying to make

38:56.508 --> 38:59.511
your smoothie,
you kept trying to help me,

38:59.554 --> 39:02.078
and I didn't let you.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.515
But I should've,

39:03.558 --> 39:06.822
because helping is everything.

39:06.866 --> 39:07.910
Right?

39:07.954 --> 39:08.911
That's what--
- Yeah.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.436
Yeah,
that's what family does.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.222
And you...

39:17.964 --> 39:20.227
You're all the family I got.

39:23.796 --> 39:27.103
Maybe that's why
I get so... scared.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.544
But the world has been
reminding me that--

39:32.587 --> 39:35.808
that fear isn't something

39:35.851 --> 39:38.376
that goes away.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.334
It's just something you face, right?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.422
Yeah.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.511
Yeah, so remember when I said

39:43.555 --> 39:45.644
that blenders
were for big people?

39:45.687 --> 39:46.775
Yeah?

39:46.819 --> 39:49.430
That was silly,
'cause you are big.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.301
You're the biggest.

39:52.215 --> 39:56.263
That's why you are gonna
make a smoothie right now--

39:56.306 --> 39:58.221
all by yourself.
- Yeah.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.876
- You ready?
- Yeah.
