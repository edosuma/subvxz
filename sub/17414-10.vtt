<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:05.266
<i>that you might need to know.
The Ring used me as a decoy.</i>

00:05.267 --> 00:06.566
You said I was safe, bro.

00:06.567 --> 00:07.400
Babe, we need to get away.

00:07.401 --> 00:08.366
Where do you want to go?

00:08.367 --> 00:10.267
Doctors Without Borders.

00:10.302 --> 00:10.999
I'm a spy, buddy.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.567
My best friend is a spy?

00:13.634 --> 00:15.534
This is the best news
I've ever heard!

00:27.067 --> 00:29.167
Dismissed.

00:31.034 --> 00:32.934
Lieutenant Alexander Coburn?

00:36.167 --> 00:37.566
Thank you for your service,
Lieutenant,

00:37.567 --> 00:38.832
but you have not qualified

00:38.833 --> 00:41.367
for training with Special
Operations Command.

00:41.434 --> 00:43.933
You'll be returning home
with your unit at 0800 tomorrow.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.900
Dismissed.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.900
Dismissed.

00:59.034 --> 01:00.934
Tic Tac?

01:02.334 --> 01:04.033
I'm sorry, Colonel?

01:04.034 --> 01:06.967
I know it's silly,
but they remind me of home.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.833
Go ahead and keep them.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.800
I have a feeling you're
gonna be out here a while.

01:17.367 --> 01:18.832
How would you feel if I told you

01:18.833 --> 01:22.100
that there was a covert
black ops team

01:22.167 --> 01:24.900
of America's finest snipers,
rangers and men

01:24.967 --> 01:27.701
willing to do anything
to protect this country,

01:27.768 --> 01:30.167
and that team wanted you?

01:30.234 --> 01:32.401
I'd say that sounds
like a dream come true, sir.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.900
And I'd say you have
quite a choice to make.

01:34.967 --> 01:39.134
Either go home to your family

01:39.200 --> 01:42.701
or you become the soldier
you always dreamed you could be.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.434
So, tell me,
Lieutenant Coburn...

01:49.334 --> 01:51.900
...are you ready to die today?

02:00.134 --> 02:03.534
I'm glad you took my call.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.501
In a matter of hours,
General Beckman

02:05.501 --> 02:08.533
is gonna give you and your team
a Trace Cell Mission

02:08.601 --> 02:10.900
to test the CIA's
security system.

02:10.967 --> 02:13.734
I need you to pick something
up for me while you're there.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.867
I know you'll make
the right decision.

02:24.933 --> 02:27.434
You always do.

02:35.867 --> 02:40.967
02200 and... two.

02:41.034 --> 02:43.034
Uh, p.m.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.301
NSA Agent John Casey
in his apartment,

02:47.367 --> 02:49.301
speaking to an
elderly gentleman.

02:49.367 --> 02:53.401
And I detect
a hint of Midwestern...

02:53.467 --> 02:55.634
I hear footsteps!

02:55.701 --> 02:58.467
Coming in from behind me,
closer, closer now.

02:58.534 --> 03:01.100
Whoever finds this video,
I want you to...

03:03.067 --> 03:04.400
Oh, it's just you, Chuck.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.601
I thought you were KGB,
maybe even a ninja.

03:06.668 --> 03:08.266
Although in that case,

03:08.267 --> 03:09.832
your footsteps would've been
a lot quieter, wouldn't they?

03:09.833 --> 03:10.733
Probably.
Yeah.

03:10.734 --> 03:12.133
What are you doing?

03:12.134 --> 03:13.667
A little spy work.

03:13.668 --> 03:15.166
I think Casey's getting a
mission. Want to listen?

03:15.167 --> 03:17.100
First of all, if Casey
was getting a mission,

03:17.167 --> 03:19.067
I would know about it because
I would be getting a mission.

03:19.084 --> 03:20.932
And secondly, you're being kept
out of the loop for a reason.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.367
Spy work is dangerous,
buddy. I can...

03:23.434 --> 03:25.334
Ooh, ooh.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.701
Pleasure working with you again,
old friend.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.668
Working on what?

03:44.734 --> 03:46.634
<i>Good morning, team.</i>

03:46.701 --> 03:49.200
Your task this week
is a Trace Cell Mission.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.733
Uh, excuse me, a Trace Cell?

03:50.734 --> 03:52.500
It means spy-proofing
our own security.

03:52.501 --> 03:54.467
The CIA's most valuable assets

03:54.534 --> 03:57.634
are held in a subterranean vault
at our Los Angeles facility.

03:57.701 --> 03:59.033
You'll need to break through

03:59.034 --> 04:00.700
15 levels of security
to get there.

04:00.701 --> 04:03.067
Will Shaw be joining us?

04:03.134 --> 04:05.234
No, Shaw's in D.C.

04:05.301 --> 04:07.133
Agent Walker,
you'll need to catch

04:07.134 --> 04:08.566
a later flight to meet him.

04:08.567 --> 04:11.200
You have your orders. Good luck.

04:11.267 --> 04:12.600
This is just great.

04:12.601 --> 04:14.900
So, now you're gonna
go meet Shaw in D.C.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.166
Does everyone have a secret
mission within a mission?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.966
It's not a mission, Chuck.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.466
This time it's personal.

04:21.466 --> 04:24.334
Oh, oh, right,
right, of course.

04:24.401 --> 04:27.501
Well, that would make sense
why I was kept out of that loop.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.267
My work is here, Chuck,
so, please, stay focused.

04:30.334 --> 04:32.501
We are up against the best
security in the world tonight.

04:32.567 --> 04:34.467
Our own.

04:47.134 --> 04:49.167
That's the door to level two.

04:49.234 --> 04:50.333
A hallway.

04:50.334 --> 04:51.466
Well, seems easy enough.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.367
Uh-uh.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.433
Oh.

05:03.434 --> 05:04.899
This is where
you flash.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.199
Just relax, Chuck,
you've got time.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.100
Nobody's banging down
on the door.

05:21.034 --> 05:24.034
* *

05:30.267 --> 05:31.500
Mission accomplished.

05:31.501 --> 05:34.100
Pace yourself, Chuck,
we've got 14 more levels.

05:38.768 --> 05:40.768
That was manageable.

05:48.501 --> 05:50.199
Now, Walker,

05:50.200 --> 05:52.301
watch the door.

05:53.534 --> 05:55.734
Hey, uh, shouldn't
we stick together?

05:55.800 --> 05:58.034
No, always gotta have
somebody watch your back.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.300
I got yours.

05:59.301 --> 06:01.201
The box we need
is around here.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.833
There it is.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.400
Did you just take something
out of that box?

06:51.401 --> 06:53.668
No.

06:53.734 --> 06:56.367
I literally just
watched you close it.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.467
Hey, hey, look,
if you're working on

07:01.534 --> 07:03.434
some secret side
mission, tell me.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.767
Breathe a word of this
to anyone,

07:06.768 --> 07:08.333
you're as good
as a dead man, Bartowski.

07:08.334 --> 07:10.234
You understand?

07:16.867 --> 07:19.167
Is everything okay?

07:21.467 --> 07:23.800
Yeah.

07:24.859 --> 07:29.091
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

08:05.333 --> 08:06.900
Chuck, hey.

08:06.901 --> 08:08.633
I need you to do
me a solid, bro.

08:08.634 --> 08:10.934
I need you to help Ellie commit
to Doctors Without Borders.

08:11.001 --> 08:13.467
What?
I- I thought that she did.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.434
Yeah, well, so did I,
but I think it all hit her today

08:15.467 --> 08:17.200
that it meant leaving L.A.
and leaving you.

08:17.201 --> 08:18.599
Now, she's
gonna come to you

08:18.600 --> 08:20.500
and I need you to back
me up on this, bro.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.332
That's probably her now.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.168
Okay. Okay.

08:26.534 --> 08:28.434
Is Devon here?

08:29.034 --> 08:32.299
Chuck, I got it.

08:33.366 --> 08:35.133
You-you got "it"?

08:35.134 --> 08:37.534
What is it?
What is this?

08:40.900 --> 08:43.299
Ellie, Ellie, this is amazing.
Oh, my God.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.000
Neurology fellowship at USC?

08:45.001 --> 08:46.366
You've wanted this since
you were in Middle School.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.432
I know, I know.

08:47.433 --> 08:48.633
But what do I do?

08:48.634 --> 08:50.366
Doctors Without Borders
is the only thing

08:50.367 --> 08:52.333
that Devon has been
excited about in weeks.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.134
Yeah, well, you know,
sometimes your dream job

09:00.201 --> 09:02.700
isn't always what you
expect it to be.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.100
<i>Unfortunately, your mission</i>

09:04.101 --> 09:06.867
at the CIA facility
was a day too late.

09:06.934 --> 09:08.233
The vault had already
been compromised

09:08.234 --> 09:11.001
and a new drug
called Laudanol was stolen.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.801
Military scientists were able
to create a prototype pill

09:13.867 --> 09:15.767
that could suppress emotions
in battlefield soldiers,

09:15.802 --> 09:19.867
make them stronger,
faster, fearless.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.499
Wait a minute,

09:21.500 --> 09:22.633
no fear?

09:22.634 --> 09:23.833
Could that help me flash?

09:23.834 --> 09:25.267
Well, maybe, but then

09:25.268 --> 09:27.367
you wouldn't feel
anything, Chuck.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.433
Right, but I could work...

09:29.500 --> 09:31.332
perfectly.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.167
We'll never know
unless we get it back.

09:33.168 --> 09:36.101
We think this might
have been an inside job.

09:36.168 --> 09:37.766
Only a handful of our people
knew the Laudanol

09:37.767 --> 09:40.867
was being kept in box 092407.

09:40.934 --> 09:43.700
Oh, yes.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.167
I get it now, you're good.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.666
You are good, General.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.567
You guys, you are good,
very good.

09:48.602 --> 09:49.966
This is a test, right?

09:49.967 --> 09:51.200
Bartowski.

09:51.201 --> 09:52.599
First there was the solo
mission on the plane,

09:52.600 --> 09:53.966
then turning an asset,

09:53.967 --> 09:55.100
now this time it's,

09:55.101 --> 09:57.101
"Chuck, will you
betray your country

09:57.168 --> 09:59.000
"or will you turn in
your friend and partner,

09:59.001 --> 10:00.766
John Casey,
for stealing the pill?"

10:00.767 --> 10:02.734
I'll play ball, okay?

10:02.801 --> 10:04.801
Guilty. He did it.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.300
Are you positive
you saw Colonel Casey

10:10.400 --> 10:12.300
take the pill, Mr. Bartowski?

10:12.367 --> 10:14.333
Yeah.

10:17.234 --> 10:19.134
No? No.

10:19.168 --> 10:22.433
No, I would-I would actually
not use the word "positive."

10:22.500 --> 10:25.101
It was very poorly lit
in that, um...

10:25.168 --> 10:28.034
I- I'm wrong half the time.

10:28.101 --> 10:30.667
Colonel Casey?
So...

10:30.734 --> 10:32.634
Would you care to respond?

10:40.433 --> 10:41.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hang on a second.

10:41.834 --> 10:44.268
Let's just all take
a breath here, okay?

10:44.333 --> 10:47.667
John Casey is one of the
most loyal spies out there.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.700
He would never do anything
to jeopardize the CIA.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.667
Casey, tell them!

10:56.467 --> 10:58.667
With all due respect, General,

10:58.734 --> 11:00.767
I will exercise my right
to remain silent

11:00.834 --> 11:02.734
under the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution.

11:02.769 --> 11:04.834
What?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.134
What are you doing?

11:09.201 --> 11:12.901
Agent Walker, please relieve
the colonel of his weapon.

11:26.101 --> 11:28.034
John, you want to tell me
what's going on?

11:45.268 --> 11:47.333
<i>Which is why I said
Left 4 Dead 2 would be better</i>

11:47.400 --> 11:49.500
as an expansion pack...
I need your help.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.033
The answer's yes.

11:51.034 --> 11:53.067
<i>I already set the DVR to record
the Mork and Mindy marathon.</i>

11:53.134 --> 11:54.599
This is not that.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.500
This is, uh, this
spy related, okay?

11:57.934 --> 12:01.201
Did you happen to record
Casey's conversation last night?

12:01.268 --> 12:03.567
That would depend.

12:03.634 --> 12:05.534
No, don't worry, don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.633
I actually need your help.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.267
Oh, sweet.
I knew you'd come around, dude.

12:10.268 --> 12:11.866
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

12:11.867 --> 12:12.866
What do you need,
audio or video?

12:12.867 --> 12:14.299
Whatever.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.834
MORGAN
2100 and 43 p.m.

12:16.901 --> 12:18.366
There's a chill in the air

12:18.367 --> 12:20.267
and hint of vanilla.

12:24.367 --> 12:27.467
A man enters
Casey's apartment.

12:28.767 --> 12:30.633
Is that static?

12:30.634 --> 12:32.534
Carrots actually.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.801
I'm sorry. I get
hungry on a stakeout.

12:46.034 --> 12:49.001
Holy crap. What is
it, Chuck? I want in.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.666
You know what, Morgan?
Trust me, in this case,

12:50.667 --> 12:52.667
the fewer details you know,
the better.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.001
Call me if you need me.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.233
Hey, show some respect.

13:09.234 --> 13:11.700
This guy was one of the best
that we had. Sorry, ma'am.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.667
Still no sign
of the Laudanol.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.333
Sarah.

13:19.901 --> 13:20.900
I just flashed.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.033
Casey is being played.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.399
His old commanding officer's

13:23.400 --> 13:24.566
a guy named James Keller.

13:24.567 --> 13:25.900
High up in special ops.

13:25.901 --> 13:28.767
He's the guy who turned
Casey's former sensei,

13:28.834 --> 13:30.967
because now
he's a member of the Ring.

13:31.034 --> 13:32.700
What? Casey doesn't
know anything.

13:32.701 --> 13:34.299
We got to talk to him
and tell him

13:34.300 --> 13:35.633
who this Keller guy
really is.

13:35.634 --> 13:37.167
We can't. Casey
committed treason.

13:37.168 --> 13:38.866
And he's still
refusing to talk.

13:38.867 --> 13:41.567
They're moving him to a
black site in Thailand-

13:41.634 --> 13:44.300
outside of U.S. torture
jurisdictions. When?

13:44.367 --> 13:45.900
Tomorrow morning.

13:45.901 --> 13:49.201
Okay, then we've got
to break him out before then

13:49.268 --> 13:51.801
and clear his name. If we do
this, and if we get caught,

13:51.867 --> 13:53.033
we're gonna be tried
for treason,

13:53.034 --> 13:54.533
and you're gonna
lose everything

13:54.534 --> 13:57.001
and you're never going to get
a chance to be a real spy.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.234
Is that what you want?

13:59.300 --> 14:01.867
It's Casey.

14:09.467 --> 14:12.367
You sure you're okay
missing your flight to D.C.?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.066
Yeah, Shaw can wait,
Casey can't.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.000
He's in a holding cell
on level 15.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.733
Now all we have to do
is just break through

14:17.734 --> 14:18.966
the security
we just spy-proofed.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.266
Well, it's only
been 24 hours.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.234
I'd be surprised
if they fixed anything.

14:22.301 --> 14:23.667
All right then.

14:23.668 --> 14:25.601
Time to save the day.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.034
Chuck, are you okay?

14:41.034 --> 14:43.167
Well, that wasn't
there before.

14:49.234 --> 14:50.700
Alert the general.

14:50.701 --> 14:52.701
We've captured
two infiltrators.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.734
I see you've encountered
my new security measures.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.734
Well done. Well done.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.366
Yeah, really
excellent work.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.199
You deserve a medal

15:06.200 --> 15:07.667
for adjusting all these
security measures

15:07.668 --> 15:08.767
so quickly.

15:08.768 --> 15:09.866
Yes, General Beckman,

15:09.867 --> 15:11.767
the spy-proofing
is excellent.

15:11.768 --> 15:13.266
Who to thank?

15:13.267 --> 15:16.634
Uh, Fitzroy.
Stanley Fitzroy.

15:16.701 --> 15:18.300
It means "son of the king."

15:18.301 --> 15:20.967
Did you get that,
General? Fitzroy?

15:21.034 --> 15:22.932
Son of the king-
she knew that as well.

15:22.933 --> 15:24.433
That's incredible.

15:24.434 --> 15:26.300
Yeah, okay, great.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.201
Uh, my name
is Charles Carmichael.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.100
And this is my partner
Sarah Walker.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.366
Uh, we're secure.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.668
Please forgive
the intrusion

15:35.734 --> 15:37.066
and condescending tone.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.401
I wasn't informed that
you two were coming.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.000
But then that must
have been the point.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.900
Um, do you like what I did
on level one?

15:44.967 --> 15:46.832
Very impressive.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.700
Very.

15:48.701 --> 15:49.832
Very, very.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.534
In fact, uh, I think
we'd both love to see

15:52.601 --> 15:54.233
what you've done
with level 15.

15:54.234 --> 15:55.400
Mm-hmm.

15:55.401 --> 15:56.700
Well, let me show you.

15:56.701 --> 15:58.601
I'll give you the tour.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.267
<i>I thought you'd be happy
for me.</i>

16:08.334 --> 16:09.667
Babe, I am.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.800
But if we do Doctors Without
Borders, we could save lives.

16:11.867 --> 16:14.467
We can save lives here in L.A.
next to my brother.

16:14.534 --> 16:15.932
I just talked
to Chuck this morning.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.266
He thought it was
a great idea.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.667
Oh, really? I find
that hard to believe

16:18.668 --> 16:20.533
because I told him about USC
and he was happy for me.

16:20.534 --> 16:22.534
Well, then I guess
we'll go talk to Chuck.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.767
Oh, nice to see you, too.

16:31.768 --> 16:33.701
Third opinion never hurts.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.967
Ellie agreed to do this. I agreed
to do Doctors Without Borders,

16:39.034 --> 16:41.000
which is a fantastic organization,
She said, and I quote, "I'm in."

16:41.067 --> 16:42.366
but that was before
I found out about my

16:42.367 --> 16:43.500
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières,
USC neurology</i>

16:43.501 --> 16:45.133
is every good doctor's
fellowship at USC,

16:45.134 --> 16:47.234
dream job. which is,
like, my dream job.

16:47.301 --> 16:49.534
Devon, it appears to me
you're being completely selfish.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.800
Morgan, sidebar now.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.767
Just a sec, babe.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.234
You can't tell Ellie
to stay here. Why?

16:58.301 --> 17:00.634
If you had all the information
that I had,

17:00.701 --> 17:02.333
you'd know that it's not safe
for her here.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.866
If you had all
the intel I had,

17:03.867 --> 17:05.768
you'd know that it is,
in fact, the safest place

17:05.867 --> 17:07.098
for her to be.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.701
What exactly do you
mean by that?

17:09.768 --> 17:10.932
Nothing. Chuck's here.

17:10.933 --> 17:13.000
He'd look after her.

17:13.067 --> 17:16.701
Yes, but Chuck's job

17:16.768 --> 17:18.833
can sometimes be

17:18.900 --> 17:21.667
more demanding
than most would expect.

17:21.733 --> 17:23.233
Indeed, sir, indeed.

17:23.233 --> 17:24.767
Sure, Nerd Herding
does often call for

17:24.768 --> 17:26.900
more than just
computer installs.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.799
Do you know?
Do you know?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.466
Do I know what? What
do you think I know?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.166
I don't think you know half
what you think you know.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.501
Fine. On three,
we both say what we know.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.566
Okay.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.266
One, two, three.

17:37.267 --> 17:38.400
Chuck's a...
Chuck's a...

17:38.401 --> 17:40.301
Oh, my God, you know.
Oh, my God, you know.

17:40.367 --> 17:41.767
When did you know?
When did you find out?

17:41.768 --> 17:42.600
A while, bro.

17:42.601 --> 17:44.534
Man, it is so cool, huh?

17:44.601 --> 17:46.668
Yeah, it's awesome, but
every time I go on a mission,

17:46.734 --> 17:48.734
I put Ellie in danger,
and I can't have that.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.200
Right.
I didn't think about that.

17:51.267 --> 17:52.932
Wait, you went on missions?

17:52.933 --> 17:54.700
You haven't?

17:54.701 --> 17:55.700
What? Of course, dude...

17:55.701 --> 17:57.601
You guys... I never
saw you out there.

17:59.234 --> 18:01.134
Hmm-hmm.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.867
Ellie, I've been thinking,
kids in L.A.,

18:04.902 --> 18:06.366
eh, they don't need your help.

18:06.367 --> 18:08.534
You know, with their
fancy designer jeans

18:08.601 --> 18:10.634
and Lady Gaga sunglasses.

18:10.701 --> 18:13.800
I say far, far away is where
a doctor could do the most good.

18:13.867 --> 18:15.233
I think that you should go

18:15.234 --> 18:16.566
and do Doctors Without
Borders, all right?

18:16.567 --> 18:18.266
<i>Médecins Sans
Frontières.</i>

18:18.267 --> 18:20.099
<i>Medecinse So Franswarez.</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:22.034
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières.</i>

18:22.100 --> 18:23.633
<i>Médecins Sans
Frontières.</i>

18:23.634 --> 18:26.967
<i>So, that was 14.
Here's level 15.</i>

18:27.034 --> 18:29.867
I'm just so glad you're pleased
with my new security measures.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.533
You know, I'm kind
of your biggest fan.

18:31.534 --> 18:32.932
Really?

18:32.933 --> 18:35.900
Yeah, yeah, I read and file
all of your mission reports.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.900
Remember when you
reverse-engineered

18:37.967 --> 18:39.066
an antidote to that bioweapon

18:39.067 --> 18:40.566
and kissed Colonel Casey
only to realize later

18:40.567 --> 18:42.199
it was all for naught?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.334
That must've been exciting
and scary

18:44.401 --> 18:45.667
at the same time, huh?

18:45.668 --> 18:46.832
Can we just skip
the details for now?

18:46.833 --> 18:48.667
We'll get
into that later.

18:48.668 --> 18:51.200
Right now I'm-I'm really
interested in how you've

18:51.267 --> 18:52.667
secured this holding cell.

18:52.668 --> 18:55.000
I'm the newest security measure.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.501
I have the only key card
in the whole building.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.301
This card is the only thing

19:00.367 --> 19:02.967
that stands between the bad guys
and the holding cell.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.199
Stanley...

19:05.200 --> 19:06.266
Hmm?

19:06.267 --> 19:08.167
We're gonna need that key card.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.866
But...

19:09.867 --> 19:11.767
Oh.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.600
Oh, no.

19:13.601 --> 19:16.933
I'll swallow the key card
if I have to.

19:18.334 --> 19:20.133
Well, that's weird.

19:20.134 --> 19:22.301
If we're still out here,
how is the alarm going off?

19:22.367 --> 19:23.899
Somebody's coming.
We don't have time for this.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.800
Time for what?

19:27.601 --> 19:28.866
Was that absolutely necessary?

19:28.867 --> 19:30.767
Yes.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.967
There, look, Casey.

19:41.234 --> 19:43.167
I really hope
that wasn't me.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.967
Don't take another step.
We just want the Colonel.

20:04.601 --> 20:07.401
Casey, you don't
understand.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.799
Keller is not who
you think he is.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.133
He's part of the Ring.

20:10.134 --> 20:12.701
Let's go, John.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.499
I can't believe that Casey's
a member of the Ring.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.866
What are we supposed
to do now?

20:36.867 --> 20:38.433
We just broke out of
a CIA facility.

20:38.434 --> 20:39.632
We gotta get out
of here first.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.533
Worry about finding
the Ring later.

20:46.334 --> 20:48.234
When three of my agents
are arrested for treason

20:49.267 --> 20:52.334
in 24 hours,
it reflects poorly on me.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.000
Look, General, Casey...

20:54.001 --> 20:55.499
You don't know
John Casey.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.966
Not the way you think.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.267
His real name is Alex Coburn.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.800
We've unsealed his file
and this is what we've learned.

21:01.867 --> 21:04.767
Alex Coburn faked his death
in Honduras

21:04.834 --> 21:07.967
in 1989,
the same day that John Casey

21:08.034 --> 21:09.733
was recruited for NSA Black Ops

21:09.734 --> 21:11.467
by a Colonel James Keller.

21:11.468 --> 21:13.000
Keller must've
recruited him again

21:13.001 --> 21:14.166
and this time for the Ring.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.566
And it's crucial
the Laudanol

21:15.567 --> 21:17.233
doesn't fall
into their hands.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.134
The only reason you're not
in federal prison right now

21:19.201 --> 21:21.633
is because I have a mission
only you can accomplish.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.234
Find and capture
Colonel John Casey.

21:24.301 --> 21:26.201
Dead or alive.

21:33.434 --> 21:35.033
Whoa!

21:35.034 --> 21:36.934
Don't say a word.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.133
Casey?

21:40.134 --> 21:41.532
Mm-hmm.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.600
I get it, I get it.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.567
This is some kind of
mission, isn't it?

21:45.867 --> 21:47.532
Yeah, that's right.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.567
How would you like to be
a part of a very important,

21:49.633 --> 21:50.933
very secret mission?

21:50.934 --> 21:52.834
Yeah, yeah, can I get
a cool call name

21:52.867 --> 21:54.233
like Condor or Lady Fingers?

21:54.234 --> 21:56.134
Yeah.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.967
Three years...

21:59.034 --> 22:01.734
three years of missions,
training, I'm his friend.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.433
How can all of that
have been a lie?

22:03.434 --> 22:05.468
I don't know,
some people change.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.067
You move forward as a spy,
and the line between what's

22:08.134 --> 22:10.267
right and wrong becomes
more and more gray.

22:10.334 --> 22:12.734
You don't know what
to believe in or...

22:12.800 --> 22:14.700
who to believe in.

22:18.034 --> 22:20.401
I thought you had changed.

22:22.934 --> 22:24.133
What do you mean?

22:24.134 --> 22:28.767
I know that you want
to be the perfect spy,

22:28.834 --> 22:31.934
and I know what
it means to you

22:32.001 --> 22:34.734
and what you've sacrificed
to get there.

22:37.667 --> 22:41.401
But please don't lose that guy
that I met three years ago.

22:44.533 --> 22:47.267
Don't give up on the things
that make you great.

22:53.533 --> 22:55.734
I'll always be that guy.

23:06.368 --> 23:08.033
Sarah, I...

23:08.034 --> 23:10.067
We should probably focus
on the Laudanol.

23:10.134 --> 23:13.134
So, the only reason

23:13.201 --> 23:15.234
that Keller would go to all
that trouble to break Casey out

23:15.301 --> 23:16.666
would be if he still
didn't have it.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.233
Which means if we get to it
before Casey does,

23:18.234 --> 23:19.532
we've got a shot
at catching him.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.500
Yeah, except there's
nothing left in the apartment.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.666
What about the Buy More?

23:22.667 --> 23:23.899
No, Casey's smarter than that.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.166
He knows he would
never get past

23:25.167 --> 23:27.033
those surveillance
cameras undetected.

23:27.034 --> 23:28.532
He would have to use somebody.

23:28.533 --> 23:33.034
And that someone would have
to be either desperate, stupid,

23:33.101 --> 23:35.334
or just plain willing to do
anything to impress him.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.400
<i>Planet of the Apes, huh?</i>

23:55.401 --> 23:57.100
Planning on watching that alone?

23:57.101 --> 24:01.101
<i>Yeah, well, you know me,
I can't get enough POTA.</i>

24:01.167 --> 24:02.333
Liar.

24:02.334 --> 24:03.566
You hated the original

24:03.567 --> 24:05.800
because their upper
lips never moved.

24:05.867 --> 24:07.733
I just...

24:07.734 --> 24:09.767
I know,
it's just so unrealistic!

24:09.834 --> 24:11.233
Morgan, did Casey ask you
to come here

24:11.234 --> 24:12.400
and get something for him?

24:12.401 --> 24:14.200
No, never.

24:14.201 --> 24:16.101
Really? Really?
Is that so?

24:16.134 --> 24:17.433
And could that something

24:17.434 --> 24:19.233
be in the case that
you're holding right now?

24:19.234 --> 24:20.467
That is absurd.

24:20.468 --> 24:21.933
Now you're just
making stuff up.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.733
Now you're just trying to...

24:23.734 --> 24:25.632
Listen, this is my
first mission, Chuck,

24:25.633 --> 24:26.766
and I don't want
to screw it up.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.100
Now Casey, he told me

24:28.101 --> 24:30.101
that I can't tell you anything,
and I won't.

24:30.167 --> 24:31.499
I'm a rock.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.167
If you give me that case
right now, I promise that later

24:34.234 --> 24:36.334
I will answer all questions
that you have

24:36.401 --> 24:38.700
about any of my missions.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.566
In sordid detail?

24:41.567 --> 24:43.467
Promise.

24:47.301 --> 24:48.400
You're making
the right choice.

24:48.401 --> 24:50.401
Okay, you're making
the right choice.

24:52.001 --> 24:54.767
Sarah, I got it.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.967
Where's Grimes?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.766
You convinced the little rodent

25:11.767 --> 25:13.100
to give you the case,
didn't you?

25:13.101 --> 25:16.301
I knew he was weak.

25:16.368 --> 25:19.834
Tell me where it is, now.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.267
Don't make me do this,
Bartowski.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.966
Don't shoot.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.867
Give me the case
and I won't have to.

25:39.934 --> 25:41.433
I believed in you.

25:41.434 --> 25:44.401
I trusted you.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.000
Chuck.

25:47.001 --> 25:48.467
I know everything, Casey.

25:48.468 --> 25:50.567
I know everything, okay?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.767
I know that you used
to be Alex Coburn.

25:52.834 --> 25:56.434
I know that you work
for James Keller,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.734
and that you stole
the Laudanol for the Ring.

26:02.867 --> 26:05.734
The only thing I don't know
is why.

26:21.967 --> 26:24.267
Alex Coburn...

26:24.334 --> 26:26.000
I had a fiancée.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.934
Now she thinks I'm dead.

26:29.967 --> 26:31.833
And if I don't turn over
the Laudanol to the Ring,

26:31.834 --> 26:34.633
they're gonna kill her.

26:40.301 --> 26:42.768
Her name's Kathleen McHugh.

26:42.833 --> 26:45.334
20 years ago, she was the girl
I was gonna marry.

26:45.401 --> 26:46.832
Love of my life.

26:46.833 --> 26:49.501
But to be a spy
and protect our country,

26:49.567 --> 26:50.600
I had to give up
that life.

26:50.601 --> 26:51.866
And now she's going to die

26:51.867 --> 26:53.033
because of a decision I made.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.967
No, we're not gonna
let that happen.

26:55.034 --> 26:56.233
If I don't deliver
the Laudanol

26:56.234 --> 26:57.400
to his location
in the next hour,

26:57.401 --> 26:58.866
they're gonna kill her.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.667
What are we waiting for?

27:00.668 --> 27:01.999
Let's go save her.
If I don't show

27:02.000 --> 27:04.100
at the meet, Keller will
know something's wrong.

27:04.167 --> 27:06.267
Well, then Chuck will
go to Kathleen's.

27:06.334 --> 27:07.767
Yeah, yeah,
Sarah's right, I'll go.

27:07.768 --> 27:09.668
Look, just give me the
address, I'll sneak her

27:09.701 --> 27:10.866
out of there,
put her in a safe house.

27:10.867 --> 27:12.199
I will protect her, Casey,
I promise.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.700
You could be charged
with treason.

27:13.701 --> 27:16.301
Hell, you didn't even know
I was Alex Coburn until today.

27:16.367 --> 27:17.667
I don't care who you were.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.568
I know who you are.

27:21.434 --> 27:23.367
And you're not in this alone.

27:25.467 --> 27:26.667
Keller still expects you
at the meet.

27:26.668 --> 27:28.568
What are we going to do?

27:32.634 --> 27:34.534
Let's go to a meeting.

27:46.967 --> 27:49.501
I'm alone, I'm unarmed.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.000
All I've got is this here Cuban.

27:52.067 --> 27:53.733
You mind?

27:53.734 --> 27:55.634
Smoke it.

28:18.467 --> 28:19.767
Hi, uh, Ms. McHugh?

28:19.768 --> 28:21.433
Yes, may I help you?

28:21.434 --> 28:22.899
Yes, I'm with the gas company.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.034
I was just checking your
meter here out back,

28:25.100 --> 28:27.367
and yeah,
I do detect a gas leak.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.434
I'm sorry to tell you, so
I need you to leave with me.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.401
Come on!
Oh...

28:32.867 --> 28:34.768
Back inside the house.
Back inside the house quick!

28:34.833 --> 28:36.133
But I thought you said...

28:36.134 --> 28:37.999
Well, ignore everything
I said previously.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.434
The gas leak is actually
outside the house. What?

28:40.501 --> 28:42.401
Trust me, ma'am, it's my job
to smell these things.

28:42.467 --> 28:43.767
See, I've been doing
it for years.

28:43.768 --> 28:44.932
The whole cul-de-sac
could blow right now!

28:44.933 --> 28:47.234
So, I need you back inside,
back inside the house.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.201
Inside, inside!

28:51.567 --> 28:54.100
Okay, this is, um,
this is getting kind of weird.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.733
Who are you really?

28:56.734 --> 28:59.434
I'm sorry, I promise
I'm not crazy.

29:00.668 --> 29:03.100
This is for your own good.
Huh?

29:03.167 --> 29:04.999
Hey!

29:05.000 --> 29:07.734
Hey, let me outta here!

29:17.601 --> 29:20.734
Hello, Alex.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.234
You got the Laudanol?

29:29.833 --> 29:32.267
I knew I could count on you.

29:33.833 --> 29:37.134
Good soldiers always
follows orders.

29:39.634 --> 29:40.999
You know, you wouldn't be
in this mess if you'd done

29:41.000 --> 29:44.301
what I told you
20 years ago.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.334
You were supposed
to let go of her.

29:46.401 --> 29:48.634
Stop caring.

29:49.668 --> 29:51.568
Tic Tac?

29:53.067 --> 29:54.899
What the hell is this?

29:54.900 --> 29:56.833
Your breath stinks.

29:56.900 --> 30:00.067
You think you're just
going to walk out of here?

30:00.134 --> 30:02.467
I got five men outside.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.967
The one thing
I always taught you,

30:05.034 --> 30:07.267
make sure you have
someone watch your back.

30:07.334 --> 30:10.167
I know.

30:14.567 --> 30:16.467
Five against one.

30:54.134 --> 30:56.200
You didn't think this through!

30:56.267 --> 30:57.866
You can't kill me

30:57.867 --> 31:00.167
or Kathleen will die.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.534
You'd never call them off.

31:02.601 --> 31:04.501
You're right.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.967
They're already at the house.

31:25.601 --> 31:27.099
Gas company, Ms. McHugh.

31:27.100 --> 31:29.000
I'm the gas company.

31:29.634 --> 31:30.566
Guys, how far are you?

31:30.567 --> 31:32.400
<i>Five minutes.</i>

31:32.401 --> 31:34.401
Look, anything immediate, you're
gonna have to handle yourself.

31:34.467 --> 31:35.932
Yeah, well,
everything is immediate!

31:35.933 --> 31:37.199
Well, then you have to flash.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.466
I can't.
There's too many of them.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.367
Take the pill, Chuck.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.233
What pill?

31:43.234 --> 31:45.234
You gave him the pill?
It's in your right pocket.

31:45.301 --> 31:48.200
The Laudanol was developed to
calm emotions, eliminate fear.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.033
Chuck, it can make you

31:50.034 --> 31:51.934
the Intersect you were
always supposed to be.

31:55.401 --> 31:56.832
Gas company, Ms. McHugh.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.733
Open up!

32:10.067 --> 32:11.967
Chuck!

32:16.000 --> 32:18.100
I just checked the meter,
everything's fine.

32:23.334 --> 32:25.150
Come on,
let me out! Help!

32:25.151 --> 32:26.899
Thank you so much... Hey!

32:26.900 --> 32:29.034
Wait a second.
What the...?

32:30.401 --> 32:32.800
You're not from the gas company.

32:44.933 --> 32:46.433
I'm not afraid...

32:46.434 --> 32:48.334
of any of you.

34:00.034 --> 34:02.100
Chuck! Chuck, stop!

34:12.800 --> 34:15.067
Oh, my God.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.000
Do I know you?

34:58.768 --> 35:01.034
Kath, I'm sorry.
I- I can't come home sooner.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.667
I've got one more mission.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.067
I think I'm going really
be able to help people.

35:05.134 --> 35:06.733
You don't have to explain.

35:06.734 --> 35:09.134
You love what you do
and you're good at it.

35:09.200 --> 35:13.134
I just want you to know,
if something happens to me,

35:13.200 --> 35:15.967
no matter what, I love you.

35:16.034 --> 35:17.799
Listen, you're never one
to get emotional with me,

35:17.800 --> 35:19.266
so don't let
your guard down now.

35:19.267 --> 35:24.634
That way you can get back to me
in one piece.

35:24.701 --> 35:27.167
Got it?

35:28.234 --> 35:30.200
Yes, ma'am.

35:30.267 --> 35:32.833
And when you do come back,

35:32.900 --> 35:36.000
I've got some news...

35:36.067 --> 35:39.067
Tonight at 2200,

35:39.134 --> 35:41.401
Lieutenant Alex Coburn
will be killed in battle.

35:41.467 --> 35:44.734
He'll die a hero
and be given a hero's funeral.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.334
From this point on,
your name is John Casey.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.334
Make it a good life,
soldier.

35:56.334 --> 35:59.534
The authorities just
arrived, Ms. McHugh.

36:01.434 --> 36:04.200
Mom.

36:04.267 --> 36:06.033
Alex.

36:06.034 --> 36:09.334
What's with the police
cars outside?

36:09.401 --> 36:11.334
It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

36:11.401 --> 36:14.534
I'll be all right.

36:14.601 --> 36:16.233
Casey...

36:16.234 --> 36:17.899
Wait.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.566
You-you can't just...

36:19.567 --> 36:20.999
What's dead is dead.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.900
It's too late now.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.667
Despite the success of
the mission, Colonel Casey,

36:35.733 --> 36:37.333
you abused your
privileged position

36:37.334 --> 36:38.966
and if you were
anyone else,

36:38.967 --> 36:40.867
you would be right back in jail.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.134
But you are not just anyone.

36:45.201 --> 36:49.067
And I'm about to give you
your second second chance.

36:49.134 --> 36:51.501
Which is two more
than most people get.

36:51.568 --> 36:52.799
Thank you, General.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.568
Second chance as a civilian.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.666
Um...

36:59.667 --> 37:00.866
but, uh-uh, General,

37:00.867 --> 37:02.599
Casey has given his entire life
to this country.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.568
I mean, surely you can't
just make him start over.

37:05.633 --> 37:07.534
He's done it once before.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.900
He shouldn't have a problem
doing it again.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.934
For the final time,

37:19.000 --> 37:20.900
you are dismissed.

37:26.967 --> 37:29.267
Good luck, John.

37:38.367 --> 37:40.267
Mr. Bartowski...

37:41.934 --> 37:44.568
Please escort Mr. Casey

37:44.633 --> 37:47.568
off government property.

38:08.401 --> 38:11.067
I want to commend
you, Agent Walker,

38:11.134 --> 38:12.833
for your work
with the Intersect.

38:12.834 --> 38:14.732
He seems to need you
less and less.

38:14.733 --> 38:18.667
Yes, uh,
Chuck has certainly changed,

38:18.733 --> 38:21.834
and he is well on his way
to becoming the perfect spy.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.700
A while back you requested
a transfer out of Burbank,

38:24.767 --> 38:26.133
and I haven't forgotten.

38:26.134 --> 38:28.834
There's an empty seat on
my flight back to D.C.,

38:28.900 --> 38:30.467
if you'd still
like to go.

38:30.468 --> 38:32.033
We could discuss it
on the way.

38:32.034 --> 38:34.434
I leave in an hour-

38:34.501 --> 38:36.401
if you'd like to join
me, Agent Walker.

38:36.434 --> 38:38.334
Thank you.

38:41.733 --> 38:43.767
* *

38:49.600 --> 38:50.999
Hey, stranger.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.400
I'm sorry, you are?

38:52.401 --> 38:54.200
Your brother,

38:54.201 --> 38:55.899
who you never see.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.433
How are you?

38:57.434 --> 38:59.534
You okay?
You look exhausted.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.034
I am. It's this, uh, it's this
Doctors Without Borders thing.

39:03.101 --> 39:05.767
I think Devon really
wants to do it.

39:05.834 --> 39:07.734
And I did, too.

39:08.468 --> 39:10.633
So I think I'm going
to do it, Chuck.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.067
Yeah?

39:13.134 --> 39:15.034
Yeah.

39:15.034 --> 39:18.667
USC neurology- that's
kind of been your dream

39:18.733 --> 39:20.633
ever since you
were a kid, El.

39:20.668 --> 39:21.933
I know, I know.

39:21.934 --> 39:24.468
But dreams change.

39:24.534 --> 39:26.700
And if there is one thing
that I know for sure,

39:26.767 --> 39:28.400
it's that I want
to be with Devon.

39:28.401 --> 39:30.100
And it might require
some sacrifice

39:30.101 --> 39:31.632
from both of us,

39:31.633 --> 39:35.367
but he's the best choice
I ever made.

39:37.534 --> 39:39.501
There you are, El.

39:39.568 --> 39:41.700
Hey, uh...

39:41.767 --> 39:44.600
can I steal you away?
Yeah.

39:44.667 --> 39:47.600
Love you. Both.

40:02.101 --> 40:03.666
Babe...

40:03.667 --> 40:05.867
I realize that I
didn't congratulate you

40:05.934 --> 40:07.732
for getting
the fellowship.

40:07.733 --> 40:10.401
And that was only
my first mistake.

40:10.468 --> 40:12.300
But I should have
talked to you first.

40:12.301 --> 40:16.301
If this is important to you,
then it is important to me.

40:16.367 --> 40:19.900
I'm sorry I lost
sight of that.

40:19.967 --> 40:22.201
Babe, take the job.

40:22.267 --> 40:24.700
We'll make it work.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.667
Together.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.568
See?

40:39.633 --> 40:41.733
This space can work.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.367
It'll be great
for civilian life.

40:45.434 --> 40:47.033
I mean, take
a look around.

40:47.034 --> 40:51.101
You got a... you
got a nice chair.

40:57.733 --> 41:00.767
You know, you can
still go back.

41:03.134 --> 41:06.934
The general made the terms
of my dismissal crystal clear.

41:12.067 --> 41:15.101
I was talking
about Kathleen.

41:19.534 --> 41:22.000
She lives right
around here, man.

41:22.067 --> 41:25.534
And, uh,
you got a daughter, Casey.

41:28.534 --> 41:31.600
You know I made my decision
between love and love of country

41:31.667 --> 41:34.000
a long time ago.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.967
And it was the right
decision for me.

41:38.934 --> 41:40.766
Now you have to make a decision

41:40.767 --> 41:42.667
whether that's
the right one for you.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.967
Walker's a good woman.

41:50.733 --> 41:52.633
It's still not too late.

42:01.301 --> 42:04.934
D.C.'s beautiful
this time of year.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.599
You from this area?

42:06.600 --> 42:08.366
No.

42:08.367 --> 42:11.301
But I'm thinking
of moving here.
