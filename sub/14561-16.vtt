WEBVTT

00:16.550 --> 00:18.486
CHARLIE: Yeah,
sorry for the short notice.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.453
It's just the one grad seminar.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.422
Oh, yes, yes. Not a problem.
Happy to help.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.356
All right.
Here are my lecture notes.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.757
They're pretty...
pretty self-explanatory.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.360
Mathematical physics. Fun.
(both chuckle)

00:26.394 --> 00:28.429
So, what's so important
that you have to miss it?

00:28.462 --> 00:30.098
Uh, you know, Amita and I

00:30.131 --> 00:31.799
have been offered
visiting professorships

00:31.832 --> 00:33.634
at Cambridge.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.503
So, we decided to move
the wedding date up

00:35.536 --> 00:37.538
to, uh... to today.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.740
(gasping)

00:39.773 --> 00:43.144
(laughing happily)

00:43.177 --> 00:44.745
Ah!

00:44.778 --> 00:46.214
Thank you.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.581
Oh, I wish I had
a visiting professorship.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.620
My shirt fits you pretty well.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.188
Ah, it's a little big.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.824
Not that we had a lot
of advance notice.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.193
What? I mean, did you
really want a big wedding?

00:59.227 --> 01:00.528
No.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.696
Actually,
I-I'm kind of relieved.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.465
Yeah. I'm excited.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.566
I think this will be good.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.403
Do you really need that?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.404
What do you mean? I'm on duty.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.506
- Ah.
- You ready?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.175
Are you kidding?

01:14.208 --> 01:15.509
Watching a son get married?

01:15.543 --> 01:17.311
Been waiting for this
a long time.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.247
All right.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.657
It's a lovely day,
an auspicious day.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.791
DAVID:
There he is.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.562
Hey, guys.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.131
- So, where's Don?
- Uh, he's bringing my dad.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.766
- Where's the bride?
- She's in her office.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.434
My dad's going to walk her down.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.602
Where's the minister?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.137
That would be me.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.605
You're a clergyman?

01:44.638 --> 01:45.873
I thought you were a monk.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.675
I'm also a minister

01:47.708 --> 01:50.478
of the Universal Life Church.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.181
A credential acquired, uh,
specifically for this occasion.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.649
Is that the one
you sign up for online?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.885
I don't take casually
the responsibility vested in me.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.487
I wouldn't imagine you would.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.688
Uh, Liz is at the office.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.257
We, uh, drew straws, and she had
to stay and answer phones.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.625
- You ready?
- Hey.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.693
I'd better be.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.827
All right.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.896
Any words of advice?

02:08.929 --> 02:10.598
Oh, yes.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.734
If you want to get out of it,
now's the time to run like hell.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.703
No, I'm serious.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.340
You are.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.745
I remember on my wedding day,

02:24.778 --> 02:27.748
I had this thought,

02:27.781 --> 02:30.551
"What if I just walk away?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.453
"Stay single, you know?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.855
"Live alone
and take things simple

02:34.888 --> 02:36.224
and easy."

02:36.257 --> 02:37.891
And over the years,
you know, I, uh...

02:37.925 --> 02:39.393
I often thought
about that other guy,

02:39.427 --> 02:40.428
that other me.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.230
On his own,

02:42.263 --> 02:45.199
free to do whatever he wanted,

02:45.233 --> 02:47.701
a life so simple
with a lot of fun.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.637
Whereas mine,

02:49.670 --> 02:52.673
well... it got
a little complicated,

02:52.706 --> 02:55.476
and sometimes painful and...

02:55.509 --> 02:56.877
Anyway...

02:56.910 --> 02:58.979
I never envied that other guy.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.281
Not once.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.751
Shall we?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.185
Yeah.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.683
LARRY:
Are you ready?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.586
At the request
of the bride and groom,

03:38.619 --> 03:41.622
uh, I'll keep my remarks short
and nontechnical.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.358
Well, as you all know, there
are four fundamental forces

03:44.392 --> 03:46.260
in physics: electromagnetism,

03:46.294 --> 03:48.262
strong nuclear interaction,

03:48.296 --> 03:50.431
weak nuclear interaction
and gravity.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.833
So, I wonder what the
technical version sounds like.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.001
I heard that.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.769
We've been talking here

03:55.803 --> 03:59.340
about the forces
that bind the universe.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.975
But what binds humans?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.744
Love.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.847
Powerful in small spaces,

04:06.880 --> 04:09.917
yet with profound effect
on distance.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.752
Love defies time,

04:11.785 --> 04:15.789
outliving both its source
and its object.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.891
Love is faster than light,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.527
for light requires time

04:19.560 --> 04:22.663
in order
to travel through space,

04:22.696 --> 04:27.401
but love reaches
its object instantaneously.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.004
Love journeys forever,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
into infinity,

04:32.940 --> 04:37.945
and it's here,
binding together two lives.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.747
Do we have the rings?

04:44.818 --> 04:45.619
Symbolic of eternity

04:45.653 --> 04:48.389
and rendered
in a beautiful element.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.824
Amita Ramanujan,

04:50.858 --> 04:53.894
do you take Charles Edward
Eppes to be your husband?

04:53.927 --> 04:54.995
Yes, I do.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.736
Charles Edward Eppes,

05:02.770 --> 05:04.738
do you take Amita Ramanujan

05:04.772 --> 05:05.973
to be your wife?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.074
I do.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.649
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.984
(all clapping)

05:23.056 --> 05:25.893
* We'll never, never, never

05:25.926 --> 05:27.661
* Never be the same

05:27.695 --> 05:31.699
* Forever, ever, ever...

05:31.732 --> 05:33.401
- ROBIN: Sparkling cider, huh?
- NIKKI: Yeah.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.102
No champagne.
We got to go back to work.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.770
Oh, hey, by the way, um...

05:36.804 --> 05:38.672
we're having a little party
at the house before they leave,

05:38.706 --> 05:39.807
so everybody's invited.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.543
Good, I still need
to buy a gift.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.378
I'm in the same state
of delinquency.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.746
I think you caught us all
by surprise.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.914
So, when are you guys
flying out to London?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.749
Three days.
It's hard to believe.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.917
(cell phone ringing)

05:49.950 --> 05:51.619
DON: Yeah, so how does it feel?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.086
Feels good.
Right?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.822
Of course, we've still got
a million things

05:54.855 --> 05:56.123
to do before we leave.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.858
And not a lot of time
to get them done.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.962
That was Liz.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.897
LAPD located Ted Dacosta.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.098
Here in L.A.?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.099
An informant spotted him

06:06.133 --> 06:08.001
20 minutes ago at a restaurant
in Larchmont.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.002
What's that?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.404
This case we've been working on

06:10.438 --> 06:11.505
for, like, two years.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.673
Go ahead.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.542
- You sure?
- I got classes.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.710
- Only my morning's covered.
- I'm sorry.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.446
- We'll celebrate later, okay?
- Don't forget to be there.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.880
- I won't. All right.
- Party. Yeah?

06:24.685 --> 06:25.953
We don't have an address on him.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.488
We don't even know

06:27.521 --> 06:29.022
- if he's staying in town.
- Let's grab him.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.866
Yeah, I want the right guy
to move it

06:38.899 --> 06:40.033
because I have so much
invested in this.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.870
Theodore Dacosta. FBI.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.438
No. You got to be kidding.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.006
DON:
No, we're not kidding you.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.207
You're arresting me?
For what?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.576
Confidence fraud,

06:48.609 --> 06:49.843
computer fraud,
financial fraud...

06:49.877 --> 06:51.945
Confidence fraud?
(glasses crashing)

06:51.979 --> 06:52.880
You mean you're a con man?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.615
This is a mistake.
I'll get it cleared up.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
You said you were
a real estate agent.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.151
You had this property
investment thing.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.754
I gave you $35,000!

07:00.788 --> 07:02.089
Sir, calm down and step back.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.156
No! He stole my money!

07:04.958 --> 07:07.160
(groaning)

07:07.194 --> 07:08.061
MAN:
You bastard!

07:08.095 --> 07:09.763
- You got it all.
- Hey!

07:09.797 --> 07:11.465
All my savings!

07:11.499 --> 07:12.265
Get off!

07:12.299 --> 07:13.501
DAVID: Dacosta, stay down.
Freeze.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.002
Don't move.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.537
- What's wrong?
- My gun.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.971
Someone grabbed my gun!

07:40.528 --> 07:42.830
So, LAPD has
a couple bystanders

07:42.863 --> 07:44.832
who say they can describe
the guy.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.700
He's Caucasian, medium build,

07:46.734 --> 07:47.535
brown hair.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.636
CATES: We got officers
canvassing.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.971
If we're lucky, it might be
someone living close by.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.674
Well, he had on jeans,
they were rolled up.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.842
These boots.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
Work boots?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.678
Brown leather,
you know, good quality,

07:57.711 --> 07:58.846
like, hip-looking.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.180
CATES:
Okay, we'll add that,

08:00.213 --> 08:02.215
see if we can make
a decent composite,

08:02.249 --> 08:03.751
but honestly,

08:03.784 --> 08:05.853
it's a long shot.

08:05.886 --> 08:06.920
Yeah. Thanks.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.292
Look, somebody picks a cop gun
up off the street,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.761
chances are they're going
to brag about it.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.863
Not if they plan to use it.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.799
Right, but maybe they plan
to stick it in a drawer

08:18.832 --> 08:20.033
at home and use it
for protection.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.035
That's not the point.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.871
I know. I get it--
it's your gun.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.238
Anything that happens,
you'll feel responsible.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.741
No. I am responsible.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.816
Okay, so we arrive
at Heathrow on Saturday.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.619
We can spend Sunday in London
before heading out to Cambridge.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.753
Oh, that's great.
I've always wanted

08:39.787 --> 08:41.889
to see the War Cabinet
Rooms Museum.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.958
Uh, I was thinking something
a little more romantic.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.326
The Tower of London?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.728
(Amita laughs)

08:47.761 --> 08:48.762
- That's romantic.
- No, it's not.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.930
You going somewhere?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.231
Huh? Yeah.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.200
I'm going to take a look
at some condos

08:53.233 --> 08:55.603
over by Old Town. I'll, uh...

08:55.636 --> 08:58.138
catch up.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.940
Didn't you tell him
that in India,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.341
it's tradition for parents
to live

09:01.374 --> 09:02.743
with their married children?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.578
I did, and he said

09:04.612 --> 09:05.879
that this isn't India.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.714
It... it doesn't seem right

09:06.747 --> 09:08.582
for him to move out
of this house.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.083
You know, I know
you own it, but...

09:10.117 --> 09:11.585
No, and it's his house.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.786
He always said that he wanted

09:12.820 --> 09:14.922
to find his own place
after I got married,

09:14.955 --> 09:16.189
and this is all
happening so fast,

09:16.223 --> 09:18.759
and now he's set on it.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.863
- Glock 19?
- Yeah.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.031
Academy gun?

09:24.064 --> 09:27.868
Uh, no. It was my second one.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.770
You've had this piece...?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.672
Six years.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.906
Feel like you've lost
a hand, huh?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.211
(groans)
That cannot be any fun.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.379
Yeah.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.314
Remember when I was issued
my first gun.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.916
I couldn't believe
I was expected

09:42.950 --> 09:44.818
to keep it on me all the time.

09:44.852 --> 09:45.919
After about a month,

09:45.953 --> 09:47.688
it's automatic.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.922
It becomes a part of you.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.759
Yeah. It doesn't have your name
on it, but it might as well.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.693
- You know?
- Losing your gun

09:52.726 --> 09:54.628
is one thing,
but knowing it's out there

09:54.662 --> 09:56.329
and someone else has it...

09:56.363 --> 09:57.865
If we have any shot

09:57.898 --> 09:59.332
at recovering this thing,
it's now, right?

09:59.366 --> 10:00.968
When people might
still be talking about it.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.970
I'll check with some guys
at Parker Center.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.039
You know, I know a few who work
with informants in that area.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.108
And one more.
Signature at the bottom.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.777
We're going to need the Bureau

10:09.810 --> 10:11.178
to send over
the original ballistics.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.081
For the unlikely scenario

10:14.114 --> 10:16.283
that your gun is used
in a crime.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.791
(sighs)

10:26.960 --> 10:29.963
Can you believe I used
to ride a bike to campus?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.199
Given your propensity
for mechanical mishaps,

10:32.232 --> 10:33.901
the world became a safer place

10:33.934 --> 10:36.937
when you opted for applied
mathematics over engineering.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.905
(chuckles)

10:37.938 --> 10:40.808
Boy, it's going
to be weird not being here.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.910
Cal Sci has been my home
for how long now?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.378
Well, why all this sentiment?
I mean,

10:45.412 --> 10:47.014
you'll be back soon enough.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.316
"No one steps twice
in the same river."

10:49.349 --> 10:51.985
Oh, yes. Heraclitus,
the weeping philosopher.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.987
It'll be different
when I come back.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.256
I mean, I'm moving on
to a new part of my life.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.925
Well, so are you.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.730
Every element in the universe
exists in a state

11:02.763 --> 11:05.298
of constant change and becoming.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.400
You know, I think it's important

11:07.434 --> 11:10.437
to let go of the things
to which we've grown accustomed,

11:10.470 --> 11:14.007
becoming mature,
gaining self-knowledge.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.709
All these trappings

11:15.743 --> 11:19.012
we surround ourselves with.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.247
You want my office, don't you?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.850
Well, I'm changing,
too, Charles.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.952
All part of the cosmic flux.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.319
And, uh...

11:26.353 --> 11:28.822
yes, I would like your office.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.496
Don heard we were making some
checks into finding his gun.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.765
LIZ:
What did he say?

11:37.798 --> 11:41.034
To treat it like any other case
of theft of federal property.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.236
In other words, don't put a lot
of time into it.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.872
Just... hey, uh,

11:44.905 --> 11:47.007
- where's Nikki?
- Putting a lot of time into it,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.442
- working her LAPD contacts.
- Ah.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.245
Good.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.781
- What's up?
- I was hoping

11:53.814 --> 11:55.048
to tell you guys all together.

11:55.082 --> 11:58.051
Um, I was offered a job in DC,

11:58.085 --> 12:00.988
running an anticorruption team.

12:01.021 --> 12:01.889
I decided to take it.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.525
That's a prestigious job.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.495
Yeah, I'm still kind of
getting used to the idea.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.365
We cool?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
We cool?
Of course we're cool, man.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.503
We had to break up
at some point, right?

12:16.536 --> 12:19.272
People were starting to talk.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.841
Don know yet?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.943
He was the one
that recommended me.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.034
(groaning)

12:47.067 --> 12:49.302
(dog barking)

12:51.204 --> 12:52.840
I mean, it doesn't sound

12:52.873 --> 12:54.975
like you could have done
anything differently.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.912
It's just one of those, uh,
unexpected things, right?

12:58.946 --> 13:01.281
But you seem troubled by it.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.150
It's the way it happened, Dad,
you know?

13:03.183 --> 13:05.518
I mean, it was right
in front of me.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.920
Yeah.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.521
Wonder what that guy
was thinking.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.124
Could have just gone off
and bought a gun, couldn't he?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.861
Not if he doesn't want it
linked to him.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.428
So, you're worried
that he's going to use it.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.331
This might sound funny
coming from me, but, uh,

13:18.365 --> 13:20.033
as they say: "It isn't guns
that shoot people.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.101
It's people that shoot people."

13:21.134 --> 13:24.104
Yeah, well,
I'm responsible for it.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.839
You trying to get it back?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.474
Yeah, I'm trying to get it back,

13:27.507 --> 13:29.609
but it's not like they can give
it special attention

13:29.642 --> 13:30.878
'cause it's my gun.

13:30.911 --> 13:35.115
You know, reason tells us that
what can be lost can be found.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.517
I'd like to help you
get your gun back.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.619
Charlie, you guys are leaving,
all right?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.122
And look, I do not want you
worrying about it.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.291
Here's the bag you wanted.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.959
Enjoy it. Use it in good health.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.627
Thanks. I've got three days.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.196
Charlie...

13:49.229 --> 13:51.031
I hate walking away
from a problem.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.432
Yeah, well, it's not
your problem.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.533
Okay, so I'm

13:53.566 --> 13:55.268
going to get on a plane,
go to Europe while your gun

13:55.302 --> 13:57.004
- is still out there?
- Yes.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.205
You know, we can't keep

13:58.238 --> 13:59.272
doing this forever.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.074
ALAN:
Oh, yes, you can.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.642
Until you're just
two old crime fighters

14:02.675 --> 14:04.144
with bladder problems.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.147
Well, yeah,
without the bladder problems.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.382
(phone rings)

14:09.416 --> 14:10.583
Eppes.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.119
Oh, great.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.353
All right, I'm on my way.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.355
LAPD has a lead on my gun, so...

14:15.388 --> 14:17.524
see you guys later.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.392
(door opens)

14:19.426 --> 14:21.128
(door closes)

14:21.161 --> 14:23.030
(sirens wailing in distance)

14:23.063 --> 14:25.065
(indistinct radio transmission)

14:36.476 --> 14:38.645
These two were known
drug dealers, Don.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.248
Both had records for assault.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.316
Both shot with the same gun.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.952
Nine mil?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.254
Preliminary tests
on the recovered shell casings

14:47.287 --> 14:49.156
match the murder weapon
to your Glock.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.235
(indistinct chattering)

15:04.137 --> 15:06.006
Nobody looks too upset.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.442
Residents complained for months
about these two.

15:09.476 --> 15:13.146
They sold to kids
and brought in a bad element.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.648
A community watch group kept an
eye on them, but LAPD was never

15:15.682 --> 15:17.184
able to make an arrest.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.286
Victims like this,
the shooters could be anybody--

15:19.319 --> 15:23.256
rival drug gangs,
robbers, locals.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.358
There are dozens of suspects.

15:25.392 --> 15:29.296
So, this shooting gives us
a second location on the gun.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.698
Narrows the search field
considerably.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.634
Well, the more the gun is used,
the more data we've got,

15:34.667 --> 15:38.305
even if bad things
are generating that data.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.241
I think Don feels responsible
for the shootings.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.310
Well, why?
His actions aren't the cause.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.246
Yeah. You'd think he'd blame the
guy who walked away with his gun

15:46.279 --> 15:48.348
or the guy who knocked it
out of his hand.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.350
Yeah, or the guy they arrested.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.453
I mean, he set the whole chain
of events in motion.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.988
You know, we keep thinking

15:55.022 --> 15:57.290
we can gauge cause and effect,
but we can't.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.459
Maybe just a small fraction

15:59.492 --> 16:00.627
of possible consequences.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.196
Aah!

16:03.230 --> 16:04.631
(phone beeps)

16:04.664 --> 16:07.400
You know, if I had known
that volunteering for the FBI

16:07.434 --> 16:11.204
I would again be tethering
myself to an electronic device!

16:13.240 --> 16:15.108
(electronic chiming)
Ooh.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.478
I think I just
inadvertently tweeted.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.380
I've been doing
an NSA-style keyword search

16:20.413 --> 16:23.383
on the Internet to find mention
of a gun matching Don's

16:23.416 --> 16:25.018
on gun sellers' Web sites.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.119
What did you get?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.087
There's
something weird going on.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.756
There are a ton of mentions
of a cop's gun,

16:29.789 --> 16:31.591
but not on sale sites.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.260
On social networking sites:

16:33.293 --> 16:35.662
Facebook, Twitter,
Craigslist, others.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.764
The social networking sites,
what are they saying?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.366
That this gun has taken care

16:39.399 --> 16:42.302
of a problem
that the cops couldn't handle.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.237
(typing)
Someone posted these photos.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.406
We're trying to track
whoever posted this.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.708
With every hour,
dozens more posts talk about it.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.244
Wait, so Don's gun
has gone viral?

16:51.278 --> 16:53.380
The message is
that this gun solves problems

16:53.413 --> 16:55.582
that good people have
with bad people.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.250
It's...

16:57.284 --> 16:59.219
it's the vigilante gun.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.387
Can we run this stuff down,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.222
you know,
find out where it is now?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.090
There are hundreds

17:03.123 --> 17:05.358
of screen names
and Web sites to track.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.360
You know who could really help
with this?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.298
Even when we rule out
the false positives,

17:11.331 --> 17:14.701
there's a lot of mentions
that clearly refer to Don's gun.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.537
Well, a Glock 19 dropped by
an FBI agent during an arrest

17:17.570 --> 17:19.772
is definitely
a specific data set.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.409
Shouldn't be too hard to perform
a social networking analysis.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.344
Identify our actors
and map their actions.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.412
Actors?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.147
People using the networks.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.250
We'll build a model
that focuses on individuals.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.785
That'll allow us to view the
structural network environment

17:32.819 --> 17:34.321
that provides opportunities

17:34.354 --> 17:36.356
- for their actions.
- That's beyond my skill set.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.291
Yeah, I've called
for reinforcements.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.360
LARRY:
Social network models

17:40.393 --> 17:43.296
interpret the structure
of human relationships:

17:43.330 --> 17:45.598
social, economic, political.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.235
Yes, yes, uh,
you'll need an adjacency matrix

17:48.268 --> 17:50.570
- for the network data.
- Adjacency matrix. Okay.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.504
Go for it.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.440
Hey, Larry, you going to be able
to handle

17:53.473 --> 17:55.275
all this FBI stuff
while I'm in Cambridge?

17:55.308 --> 17:56.443
No.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.544
No, you're not?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.212
Uh, not by myself, no.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.181
You know, like Sherlock's
brother, Mycroft Holmes,

18:01.214 --> 18:02.649
I prefer to do
the conceptualizing,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.485
leaving the grunt work
to others.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.220
Well, with me and Amita
both away,

18:07.254 --> 18:08.488
who's going to be
your algorithm slave?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.458
He stands at your chalkboard.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.825
OTTO:
Uh, if you express the nodes

18:12.859 --> 18:15.428
in this manner, you can identify

18:15.462 --> 18:17.264
relational ties
as channels for transfer

18:17.297 --> 18:19.332
or flow of material resources.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.900
(chuckles) I had no idea
that graph theory

18:20.933 --> 18:23.170
- could be so much fun.
- Otto, is this true?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.904
You're going to help him

18:24.937 --> 18:26.673
- on FBI cases?
- Am I?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.842
Oh, excellent. (chuckles)

18:29.876 --> 18:32.179
A chance to show
what physicists can do.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.346
You mathematicians,

18:33.380 --> 18:36.249
you had your shot.
(chuckles)

18:42.422 --> 18:45.292
They're talking about my gun
on the Internet?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.294
How do you know
if any of this stuff is real?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.561
We know when and where
it was stolen.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.197
We know it was used
in Highland Park.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.399
We've got the list of suspects.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.735
We've got anchoring facts,
and we're going to get more.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.171
You're talking about one gun
in all of L.A.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.873
You know about the six degrees
of separation phenomenon?

19:00.907 --> 19:02.675
- Yeah.
- In math,

19:02.709 --> 19:06.479
the same thing is called
the small world problem.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.948
By using principles
of the small world problem,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.550
we build an algorithm

19:10.583 --> 19:13.386
to filter through millions
of social links,

19:13.420 --> 19:16.556
and identify individuals
using local information,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.758
like the Internet,
to create paths in the network

19:18.791 --> 19:21.628
for a specific purpose:
the transfer of your gun.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.564
So, in essence, we turn
the immense social network

19:24.597 --> 19:27.567
of Los Angeles into
the equivalent of a small town.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.569
Charlie, what are you doing?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.471
You should get out of here.
You guys should be getting ready

19:31.504 --> 19:32.171
to go.

19:32.205 --> 19:32.705
This is my way of getting ready.

19:32.739 --> 19:33.640
What are you doing?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.408
You're not trying
to postpone all this,

19:35.442 --> 19:37.710
- now, are you?
- No.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.947
Charlie...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.815
look, this is my problem.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.617
You got to live your life.

19:44.651 --> 19:48.255
You know, most of our lives,

19:48.288 --> 19:51.891
we've lived in completely
separate worlds.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.427
I don't want
to go back to that.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.364
(sighs)

19:57.397 --> 19:58.831
Yeah, I hear you. I know.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.734
But I don't think we will.

20:01.768 --> 20:05.272
We won't be working together.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.841
That doesn't matter.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.447
Thanks.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.917
Hey, LAPD got a break
in the drug dealer shooting.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.919
Print on a shell casing
matched a member

20:19.952 --> 20:21.454
of the community watch group--

20:21.488 --> 20:23.490
a guy who got into a shoving
match with the victims

20:23.523 --> 20:24.624
when he was taking photos
of them.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.792
They run a GSR?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.560
Yeah, he recently fired
a weapon.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.998
I was cleaning the garage,
found some old fireworks.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.468
That's where the gunpowder
traces came from.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.936
- That's not going to hold up.
- It has to.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.939
- I didn't shoot anybody.
- DAVID: You knew the victims.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.509
You argued with them
days before they died.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.876
Me and a lot of people.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.044
Their buyers mugged kids

20:45.077 --> 20:47.680
walking home from school.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.483
78-year-old woman
had her arm broken by one

20:50.517 --> 20:52.218
of their customers.
(knocking)

20:56.088 --> 20:57.557
I got it off
this suspect's BlackBerry.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.958
He posted a message online

20:58.991 --> 21:01.661
saying he put the gun
in a trash can in an alley.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.963
LAPD says it's already gone.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.736
Who did you pass the gun to?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.638
No idea
what you're talking about.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.552
(metallic crashing,
car alarm blaring)

21:26.819 --> 21:29.689
(tires squeal)

21:33.092 --> 21:34.427
(tires squeal)

21:40.633 --> 21:43.603
(horn blaring)

21:48.375 --> 21:50.543
(horn stops, siren blips)

21:50.577 --> 21:52.445
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:54.381 --> 21:55.715
This is Evelyn Ryerson.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.450
She's got a couple of DUIs

21:57.484 --> 21:59.619
and several traffic accidents,
mostly minor,

21:59.652 --> 22:00.487
but about six months ago,

22:00.520 --> 22:02.655
she injured two people
at a crosswalk.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.791
What's she even doing

22:04.824 --> 22:06.058
behind the wheel?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.660
She's got no license.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.497
This is her brother's car,
taken without permission.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.865
There's an empty fifth
on the floor.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.135
Just wouldn't stop driving,
so somebody decided to stop her.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.804
I think people
are saying it's okay

22:17.837 --> 22:19.639
to take the law
into their own hands.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.841
Yeah, with my gun.

22:29.115 --> 22:32.084
DAVID: Evelyn Ryerson's murder
looks like a vigilante act.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.788
The chronic alcoholic,
menace behind the wheel.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.824
We got dozens of suspects.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.059
See, I can sort through
those suspects two ways:

22:40.092 --> 22:41.861
by motivation
and by opportunity.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.463
She was shot close to home.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.997
I'll weight her neighbors
pretty high.

22:45.031 --> 22:45.798
Lot of fake I.D.s

22:45.832 --> 22:47.066
and anonymous posts to go
through.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.536
You can hide your name-- it's a
lot harder to hide your motive.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.804
DAVID: She was set to check
into a rehab facility

22:51.838 --> 22:53.105
in three days.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.807
She paid for it in advance.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.008
Two months.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.511
Really?
She was trying to change.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.947
Yeah. She made her move
a little bit too late.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.049
ROBIN:
What's bothering you?

23:03.082 --> 23:06.653
This is about more than just
losing your gun, isn't it?

23:06.686 --> 23:08.788
You know, it's the gun.
It's the whole thing.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.157
Just trying to decide
what to do, where to go.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.594
It's tough when you're not
being given obvious choices.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.596
You're not being
assigned to something.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.565
Your family doesn't
need your help.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.967
It's just you
and what you want to do.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.536
What it is, is I have
this crazy take on all this.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.137
What's that?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.540
Like losing my gun
is some sort of test.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.043
And if I don't find it, that
means I should leave the Bureau.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.812
I don't think that you can let
a chance occurrence

23:32.845 --> 23:34.581
have that much influence on you.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.049
Yeah, but if I can't do
more good than harm, you know,

23:37.083 --> 23:38.851
I shouldn't be doing this.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.021
LARRY: This garage was built
the same year the house was?

23:42.054 --> 23:44.123
Yeah. Yeah, 1908.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.825
Never done much to it.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.460
Probably needs a lot of work.

23:47.494 --> 23:50.029
Yeah. Indeed, it does.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.631
Charlie, I think
I found something here.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.799
Okay, I've tracked a thread

23:52.832 --> 23:53.900
of messages on Victim-Aidline

23:53.933 --> 23:55.468
to different sites and servers.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.169
Most users have a shielded I.D.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.838
or account, but not this one.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.073
CHARLIE:
"Linda Samuelson."

24:01.107 --> 24:02.141
Do you know
that that's her real name?

24:02.174 --> 24:03.843
Well, it's linked to Web sites

24:03.876 --> 24:05.878
for her jobs, her kid's schools.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.580
Looks genuine.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.115
She's arranged
to pick up the gun.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.517
LARRY:
Linda Samuelson.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.985
Why would she use her real name?

24:13.019 --> 24:14.220
Well, she used a screen name,
"BusyMom8."

24:14.253 --> 24:17.023
Most people think that's enough
to hide who they really are.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.660
Well, then, we might have
just found Don's gun.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.499
I found the gun
in a bag in a park.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.734
Through an arrangement you made

24:27.767 --> 24:30.202
on a Web site
called Victim-Aidline.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.237
Who was your contact?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.072
It was anonymous.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.707
Why did you want the gun?

24:34.741 --> 24:37.276
My ex-boyfriend beat me up.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.046
He said he'd kill me
if I broke up with him.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.914
So, your solution
was to shoot him?

24:41.948 --> 24:44.917
I got a restraining order,
but that just enraged him.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.121
I have
an eight-year-old daughter,

24:49.155 --> 24:51.958
and I am not leaving her alone.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.127
So, when I read about a gun

24:55.161 --> 24:56.629
that couldn't be traced to me...

24:58.865 --> 25:00.132
Oh...

25:00.166 --> 25:02.068
then, when I actually
held it in my hand,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.070
I realized
what I'd have to do with it.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.240
DAVID: So, I understand
he's in jail now?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.876
He came to my work,

25:09.909 --> 25:11.778
and one of my coworkers
called the police.

25:11.811 --> 25:12.945
They arrested him.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.881
Well, the system did work.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.318
I don't know how long
he's going to be locked up.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.253
And I'm moving.
I'm changing my name.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.689
I've got no new job.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.624
I don't know where my daughter's
going to school.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.125
If that is the system working...

25:26.158 --> 25:27.159
(laughs angrily)

25:27.193 --> 25:29.161
Where's the gun now?

25:29.195 --> 25:31.230
I put a message

25:31.263 --> 25:33.265
on Victim-Aidline
and got a response.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.201
I left it
where they asked me to--

25:35.234 --> 25:36.869
by a bus bench in Silver Lake.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.204
I'm going to need a name.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.640
All I know is Jim.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.816
We found the bus bench
and the bushes,

25:49.849 --> 25:51.050
but the gun was already gone.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.085
There are some 20 sets
of prints on the bench,

25:53.119 --> 25:54.086
so we're running those down.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.154
Are any street cams in the area?

25:55.187 --> 25:56.222
Both ends of the street.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.791
One side was a bank,
the other was a gas station.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.093
We got the techs looking at
the tapes right now.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.895
All right,
we have some 800 people

26:02.929 --> 26:03.896
registered at Victim-Aidline.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.832
We got 37 named James or Jim.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.199
Of course.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.768
Too bad the name wasn't Eustice.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.070
Yeah. The top three Jims
on the list...

26:11.103 --> 26:12.905
So, one guy was injured
in a bar fight.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.206
The other one's got a neighbor

26:14.240 --> 26:15.274
who's bullying everybody
on the block.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.643
There's a third one who...

26:16.676 --> 26:18.277
he threatened a man
who was acquitted

26:18.310 --> 26:20.246
of raping his adult daughter.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.748
I'm not shooting him.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.215
I'm suing the bastard.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.285
You're filing a civil suit
against your daughter's rapist?

26:26.318 --> 26:29.388
In a civil suit, we don't need
proof beyond reasonable doubt.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.158
And we can strip him clean,
take everything he owns

26:32.191 --> 26:35.061
or will earn
for another ten years.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.166
I told the cops Stan hit me.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.400
He denied it.
My word against his.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.070
You posted on a Web site
that if you had a gun

26:44.103 --> 26:45.772
that couldn't be traced,
you'd use it.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.306
I was drunk when I wrote that.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.041
Did you get a gun?

26:53.079 --> 26:56.115
Look, Agent,
I'm not an idiot, okay?

26:56.148 --> 26:58.084
And besides,
he didn't kill me.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.653
Like they say,
"An eye for an eye..."

27:02.855 --> 27:04.991
I just want him
to wind up like this.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.660
MAN:
Call the police

27:07.694 --> 27:09.061
a dozen times, nothing happens.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.764
Post on a message board,
I've got the FBI in my house.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.033
You indicated an interest
in acquiring a stolen gun.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.003
- No. I only made some comments.
- DON: About what you

27:17.036 --> 27:18.170
would do with it.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.271
DAVID: You
said you were going to use it

27:19.305 --> 27:21.107
on your neighbor,
Michael Hiller.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.242
WOMAN:
Jim, no.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.011
Okay, I-I... I wrote some things

27:25.044 --> 27:26.746
I probably shouldn't have.
That's it.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.347
Listen, if I get a gun,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.116
I'm buying it legally.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.919
A gun is not going to solve
a conflict with a neighbor.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.987
A conflict with a neighbor.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.257
Yeah, you cops
always make it sound

27:38.290 --> 27:39.792
like it's a two-way thing.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.360
He's crazy.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.095
He dumps his garbage

27:43.129 --> 27:45.364
- on people's lawns.
- WOMAN: But if you say anything

27:45.397 --> 27:46.966
to him about it, the next day,
your windshield's smashed.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.367
Our neighbor
down the street tried

27:48.400 --> 27:50.136
to have a, uh,
backyard barbecue.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.371
He started to throw things
over the fence

27:52.404 --> 27:54.040
into their yard,
screaming that they

27:54.073 --> 27:55.341
were disturbing him.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.943
Our dog got out,

27:56.976 --> 27:58.344
ran into his yard.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.913
He kicked her so hard,
he nearly killed her.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.348
I go over

28:02.381 --> 28:04.283
to talk to him about it,
he punches me

28:04.316 --> 28:05.818
in the face, broke my nose.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.219
Did you report this?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.420
Yes, I reported it.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.455
The police told me

28:09.488 --> 28:11.724
that it was a mutual dispute.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.860
They told me
to stay off his property.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.228
The next day, all four tires
on my car are slashed.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.997
WOMAN: He taunts us--
he says he knows how to do

28:18.030 --> 28:19.165
whatever he wants to do
without being caught.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.099
JIM:
And the cops say

28:20.132 --> 28:21.934
that unless you catch Hiller
in the act,

28:21.968 --> 28:22.969
there's nothing you can do.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.985
With or without your gun,

28:39.018 --> 28:41.353
this situation
is not going to end well.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.923
Yeah. Let's see what we can do
about that guy, huh?

28:45.457 --> 28:47.994
DAVID:
Jim Mazzolla may or may not

28:48.027 --> 28:49.896
have Don's gun,
but he sure as hell

28:49.929 --> 28:52.098
has motivation to use it
because of this guy.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.432
COLBY:
Mike Hiller, the neighbor.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.868
This guy's just
a malignant narcissist

28:55.902 --> 28:57.436
who gets off on scaring people.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.938
He sets his own rules

28:58.971 --> 29:00.539
and wants everybody else
to play by them.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.208
Yeah, these types know
how to cause damage

29:02.241 --> 29:03.442
without getting caught,
and they don't stop.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.544
You think Mazzolla
would actually use a gun?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.146
DAVID:
I don't know.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.248
He feels helpless,
and this family...

29:09.281 --> 29:11.083
they are scared to death.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.451
I know. We got a lot

29:12.484 --> 29:13.986
of other Jims to look at, too.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.888
We need to find a way
to narrow it down.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.090
Hey, I got something
for you guys to take a look at.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.859
So, Amita and I have
a Bayesian filter--

29:19.892 --> 29:21.193
a spam filter, if you will.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.195
We set it loose
in the message boards

29:23.229 --> 29:24.997
with the post about Don's gun.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.332
This message thread

29:26.365 --> 29:28.334
is for people
who can't get police help--

29:28.367 --> 29:29.869
cases of harassment, abuse.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.137
DAVID:
Yeah, by

29:31.170 --> 29:33.239
estranged spouses,
uh, business disputes,

29:33.272 --> 29:34.073
neighborhood conflicts.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.007
Right,
we took the membership list,

29:35.041 --> 29:36.976
cross-referenced it
with police reports

29:37.009 --> 29:39.912
and got a high score
on this name.

29:48.354 --> 29:51.457
So you're rerunning the Bayesian
filter for verification.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.060
I'm not sure what help
a plasma physicist can provide

29:54.093 --> 29:55.527
for a pure
mathematical analysis.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.429
Well, it's the same
as a cosmologist.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.031
I mean, critical thinking.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.367
And any good
equation monkey needs

30:01.400 --> 30:03.335
to be familiar
with the applicable tools

30:03.369 --> 30:05.237
of mathematical crime fighting.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.039
Equation monkey?

30:07.073 --> 30:09.541
That's what Einstein used
to call his very good friend

30:09.575 --> 30:11.944
and mathematical contributor,
Marcel Grossmann.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.014
Has anyone noticed
how compromised the integrity

30:15.047 --> 30:16.248
of these load-bearing
elements are?

30:16.282 --> 30:18.450
What, you mean,
do Charlie and Alan realize

30:18.484 --> 30:19.919
the garage roof is sagging?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.921
Yes, yes. The roof.
Really saggy.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.023
You know, I tell you, it is odd

30:24.056 --> 30:25.958
how they've let
this garage deteriorate,

30:25.992 --> 30:28.227
especially given how much time
they spend here.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.461
This is a good space. You know,

30:29.495 --> 30:30.963
you could do something
with this place.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.865
Yes, yes, yes,
like-like park cars.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.634
Amita, as co-owner

30:35.667 --> 30:37.269
of this house,
would you consider

30:37.303 --> 30:40.439
a possible, oh,

30:40.472 --> 30:43.309
redefining
of this particular space?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.311
If you're thinking
what I'm thinking,

30:45.344 --> 30:46.879
I would be very interested.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.014
OTTO:
Good. Good.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.482
I love topological problems.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.218
Otto, you do realize

30:52.251 --> 30:55.988
we're talking
about remodeling the garage?

30:56.022 --> 30:57.289
Oh.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.125
I thought we were possibly
discussing defects

30:59.158 --> 31:00.659
and electronic properties
in graphene, but...

31:00.692 --> 31:02.929
Uh... no.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.630
Not this time.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.103
Who the hell are you?

31:11.137 --> 31:12.604
You can't come on my property.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.574
COLBY:
Understand you're having

31:15.607 --> 31:16.642
some problems
with the neighbors.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.979
I handle my own problems,
unlike some around here.

31:20.012 --> 31:20.947
What kind of problems, sir?

31:20.980 --> 31:23.049
I don't talk to cops,

31:23.082 --> 31:24.917
especially skinny bitch cops.

31:24.951 --> 31:28.120
Hey, you watch the way
you speak to my partner.

31:28.154 --> 31:29.888
I was referring to you.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.591
Now, get off my property,

31:32.624 --> 31:33.725
or my lawyer
will call your supervisor,

31:33.759 --> 31:35.627
and you'll both have a report
in your personal files.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.531
I don't like being harassed
by federal agents.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.969
Go.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.370
Scoot.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.974
Move.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.445
(door opens)

31:53.479 --> 31:55.414
(door closes)

31:57.183 --> 31:58.985
NIKKI:
Mike Hiller's got

31:59.018 --> 32:01.120
a driver's license
and a checking account,

32:01.153 --> 32:02.388
but nothing else.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.090
No birth certificate,
no employment history.

32:04.123 --> 32:07.026
It's like he never existed
until six months ago.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.160
Yeah, he's been
through the legal system.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.361
He knows the routine.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.629
And how to push a cop's buttons.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.498
This guy's got
a record somewhere.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.733
You think he'd be laying low,
trying to mind his own business.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.135
LIZ:
His type can't do that.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.503
They're addicted to conflict.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.770
They need to be aggressive
and threatening.

32:18.804 --> 32:22.674
Guys like Hiller only get worse
until they're finally caught.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.011
Hey, guys, techs found this
on the tape

32:25.044 --> 32:26.745
from a gas station security cam.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.480
It's Mazzolla's car.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.116
It's parked 50 feet
from the place

32:30.149 --> 32:32.184
where Don's gun was stashed
two days ago.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.485
NIKKI:
Mazzolla lied.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.720
He's got Don's gun.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.688
And he's going to use it
on his neighbor.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.698
You can't do this.
You don't have any evidence.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.067
It's called probable cause.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.035
Your car was videotaped

32:49.068 --> 32:50.669
at a drop site for the gun.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.172
There's no gun.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.373
Look, just calm down.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.175
It's better if you tell us.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.676
JIM:
This is ridiculous.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.078
Look all you want.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.612
I don't have it.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.114
Go ahead, tear the place apart.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.050
The money I get
from suing the FBI

33:04.083 --> 33:05.984
will pay for a great renovation!

33:07.119 --> 33:08.754
Damn.

33:08.787 --> 33:09.588
What is it?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.023
It's not him.
He doesn't have it.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.233
Finally,

33:21.267 --> 33:22.534
a cop when you need one.

33:22.568 --> 33:27.039
Enjoy juvie, kid.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.075
- Jim, what are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.309
Stopping him.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.111
Not like this, kid.
Can't do it like this.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.445
I have to

33:33.479 --> 33:35.781
before you take away the gun.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.152
You think this guy
is going to hurt your family.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.088
- We know that.
- JIM JR.: He won't stop

33:42.121 --> 33:43.322
until we stop him.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.590
DAVID:
And if you shoot him,

33:44.623 --> 33:47.559
you're going to ruin
your life forever.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.496
Fine.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.563
I want that punk arrested.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.565
Shut your mouth!

33:53.599 --> 33:56.202
Jim, I'm just going
to talk to you for...

33:56.235 --> 33:57.503
for a second here, okay?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.571
I'm not going to do anything.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.308
I've been an FBI agent
for 15 years.

34:02.341 --> 34:05.644
I trained for stuff like this.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.413
I can take that gun from you
if I want.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.780
I can trick you
into giving it to me,

34:08.814 --> 34:10.116
I can get inside your head,

34:10.149 --> 34:12.118
but I'm not going to do
any of that.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.253
Want to know why?

34:16.855 --> 34:18.357
I know you don't want
to shoot him.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.825
I know it.
You just want to scare him

34:19.858 --> 34:21.560
just like he did
to your family, and...

34:21.593 --> 34:22.761
and I understand, believe me.

34:22.794 --> 34:23.595
Protecting your family

34:23.629 --> 34:25.431
is the most important thing,
but...

34:25.464 --> 34:27.166
you got to give me
that gun, Jim.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.269
'Cause that's the best way

34:30.302 --> 34:31.737
to protect them now.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.288
HILLER: Hell of a way
to raise your son, Mazzolla.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.557
Assault with a deadly weapon.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.259
He's going to do time,

34:53.292 --> 34:54.626
and I'm going to sue you

34:54.660 --> 34:56.262
for every nickel you got!
And you,

34:56.295 --> 34:58.630
arrest that kid
and get your lousy Feds...

34:58.664 --> 35:00.199
Hey! Hey! What do you think
you're doing?!

35:00.232 --> 35:01.367
I didn't touch you.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.668
Get these cuffs off of me,

35:02.701 --> 35:04.670
- or your career is over.
- I don't think so.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.872
No? What are you
charging me with?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.374
- You've got nothing.
- You know what?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.776
I just have a feeling
I'll find something.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.811
Will you look at this.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.347
You trying to take my job
right out from under me?

35:16.382 --> 35:18.550
What the hell!

35:18.584 --> 35:20.652
You see, Hiller is really
Michael Ray Simmons.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.521
Escapee from the
Florida State Prison

35:22.554 --> 35:23.622
where he was doing
a life sentence

35:23.655 --> 35:24.923
without parole
for double murder.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.193
No way. I-I'm not that guy.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.126
Liz found a fingerprint match,

35:28.160 --> 35:30.229
saw my name on his sheet,
and here I am.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.630
Oh, so he's one of yours?

35:31.663 --> 35:33.365
I don't believe this.

35:33.399 --> 35:34.566
Yeah, sucks to be you.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.168
See you got your gun back.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.703
Good job, Eppes.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.872
Oh, and tell
that brother of yours

35:40.906 --> 35:43.375
I can't believe
I wasn't invited to his wedding.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.650
NIKKI:
We pieced the chain together

35:51.683 --> 35:53.852
from James Mazzolla Jr.
to the battered woman

35:53.885 --> 35:55.887
to Ralph Morris,
community watch guy.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.956
COLBY:
And we wound up with a fugitive

35:57.989 --> 35:59.458
on Ian Edgerton's list.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.526
What are the odds?

36:00.559 --> 36:01.793
Guess we'd have to ask Charlie.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.629
He'd say it was a coincidence.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.830
Hey, so, Betancourt,
you got a little

36:04.863 --> 36:07.299
extra time to help me out
with a case I'm, uh, working on?

36:07.333 --> 36:09.401
You looking
for a rebound partner?

36:09.435 --> 36:10.569
Yeah, maybe I am.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.737
Got a problem with that?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.239
Not at all, Idaho.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.740
- Not at all.
- LIZ: Great.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.775
Leave me to be the third wheel.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.477
We could all be partners.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.745
Not officially,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.647
but, yeah,
I get what you're saying.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.948
COLBY:
David's taking

36:22.981 --> 36:24.916
the promotion,
Charlie's moving to England.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.985
Guess it's just down to us, huh?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.987
What do they always say
in the movies?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.957
"If we all stick together,
everything will be okay."

36:31.990 --> 36:35.361
Fine. As long as we stay away
from hugging and high-fives.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.733
(laughter)

36:43.669 --> 36:44.870
(imitates explosion)

36:48.840 --> 36:51.277
You know I can't let you walk
out of here

36:51.310 --> 36:53.445
without saying something, right?

36:53.479 --> 36:55.447
And why is that?

36:55.481 --> 36:57.416
Losing your gun--
it helped to, uh...

36:57.449 --> 36:59.251
to capture a violent fugitive

36:59.285 --> 37:01.620
and saved a family.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.988
Three people
still lost their lives,

37:03.021 --> 37:03.989
even if they weren't
exactly innocent.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.426
You don't think the good
balances out the bad?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.328
You can't know that.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.930
Yeah, well,
you got that part right.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.500
I'm going to tell you something.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.035
I've worked with you
for six years.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.471
You know, and regardless
of how many times

37:19.505 --> 37:21.006
you've questioned
your decisions,

37:21.039 --> 37:23.275
or you've beat yourself up,

37:23.309 --> 37:25.577
I know...

37:25.611 --> 37:27.613
I know in my heart,

37:27.646 --> 37:31.049
in the end,
Don Eppes is a force.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.052
You are a weapon
for what's right,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.722
what's good and what's true.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.361
Thanks.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.997
Going to make yourself
one hell of a good team leader

37:46.031 --> 37:47.933
down there in DC.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.404
You know what? I will.

37:52.438 --> 37:56.308
* Twilight sky...

37:56.342 --> 37:58.276
(lively chattering)

38:00.412 --> 38:02.080
(glass clinking)

38:02.113 --> 38:03.749
(talking stops)

38:03.782 --> 38:07.052
I've been having
a hard time saying good-bye.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.921
My father and brother
are probably pretty tired

38:09.955 --> 38:12.591
of hearing me tell them
how much I love them.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.925
No.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.527
Hey, Larry,

38:15.561 --> 38:17.363
want to thank you for giving me
the wisdom I needed

38:17.396 --> 38:19.030
- to grow up.
- (quietly): Oh.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.499
And the frequent scientific

38:20.532 --> 38:23.068
beat-downs I needed
to expand my thinking.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.937
David, Colby, Liz, Nikki--

38:25.971 --> 38:28.039
thank you so much
for sharing your world with me.

38:28.073 --> 38:31.577
You've taught me the power
of courage and service.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.712
And you saved my life
a few times.

38:33.745 --> 38:37.048
Amita, you and I got
to share both worlds,

38:37.082 --> 38:38.784
and you married me.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.519
(laughter)

38:40.552 --> 38:41.753
Anyway, thank you all so much.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.422
- Hear!
- Cheers.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.890
- Congratulations.
- ALAN: Cheers.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.758
I might follow
those very kind words

38:46.792 --> 38:48.394
with a very brief announcement.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.561
You're not going back
into space, are you?

38:49.595 --> 38:51.129
No, but I am about

38:51.162 --> 38:54.132
to embark on a mission
to redefine space.

38:54.165 --> 38:59.137
The space I am referring to
happens to be your garage.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.373
While Charlie and I
are in England,

39:01.407 --> 39:04.376
Larry is going
to help Alan remodel the garage.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.944
ALAN:
He's going to do what now?

39:05.977 --> 39:07.379
It needs a renovation.

39:07.413 --> 39:08.480
Oh, yeah.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.781
And as co-owner
of this property,

39:09.815 --> 39:11.016
I think it would be best

39:11.049 --> 39:12.518
- redone as a guesthouse.
- Oh.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.720
Uh, what about
what the other co-owner thinks?

39:14.753 --> 39:16.154
I imagine that he would think

39:16.187 --> 39:18.824
that if his father chooses
to live in the new guesthouse,

39:18.857 --> 39:20.959
it would be a way
for him to stay close,

39:20.992 --> 39:22.594
yet have his own space.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.397
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.099
What do you say?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.470
I guess my first question
is, um...

39:32.738 --> 39:34.673
...what's the rent going to be?

39:34.706 --> 39:37.175
(laughter)

39:37.208 --> 39:40.078
- LIZ: Congratulations.
- DAVID: Congratulations!

39:40.111 --> 39:41.413
(whooping and whistling)

39:41.447 --> 39:46.885
* Twinkling above me

39:46.918 --> 39:51.590
* Show me you're lucky

39:51.623 --> 39:57.195
* And send my love tonight.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.498
(indistinct chatter)

39:59.531 --> 40:01.700
ROBIN:
Hey.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.102
Here's to lost things found.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.438
To brides and grooms everywhere.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.840
Mmm. They made a brave move.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.877
Well...

40:11.910 --> 40:13.845
we all have to move on sometime.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.180
Mmm.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.182
Sometimes it feels safer
to stay where you are.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.784
More to life than that, right?

40:18.817 --> 40:21.620
Yeah.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.856
You know, I was offered that
special agent in charge gig.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.925
Think I'm going to take it.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.895
That's great.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.162
I thought you were going
to quit.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.232
- It's what I do.
- Mm-hmm.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.468
- I'm good at it.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.237
That's good.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.206
You know,

40:41.239 --> 40:44.476
when I asked you to marry me
and you said no...

40:44.510 --> 40:46.945
you were right.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.915
I was trying
to figure things out,

40:49.948 --> 40:52.518
and I really wanted you
to decide for me.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.659
I know what I want...
more than ever.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.194
I want you to marry me.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.598
Will you marry me?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.771
Yes.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.273
(both laughing)

41:15.306 --> 41:20.145
* The winter's marked
the Earth *

41:22.614 --> 41:27.786
* Its floor with frozen glass

41:29.287 --> 41:33.825
* You slip into my arms...

41:33.859 --> 41:35.661
CHARLIE:
I can't believe that in 28 hours

41:35.694 --> 41:37.295
we're going to be living
in a country

41:37.328 --> 41:38.664
with 50-hertz electrical current

41:38.697 --> 41:40.265
and public health care.
(Amita laughs)

41:40.298 --> 41:44.069
Yeah. It's easy to get homesick
when you have a home like this.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.571
I'm going to finish packing.

41:45.604 --> 41:47.305
CHARLIE:
Okay.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.675
I'm just going to miss...
everything.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.677
Well, we're going to miss you,
too, Chuck.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.245
I won't miss
being called Chuck, but...

41:54.279 --> 41:55.747
(laughs)
For the first time

41:55.781 --> 41:58.316
in a long time, it feels
like things are really...

41:58.349 --> 41:59.150
settled here.

41:59.184 --> 41:59.851
ALAN: Well,
I guess that makes it

41:59.885 --> 42:02.120
the best time to move on, huh?

42:02.153 --> 42:03.321
What are you drawing?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.190
I thought I'd get a jump
on the new project.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.324
What do you got, the garage?
Let me see that.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.726
Uh, guesthouse.

42:07.759 --> 42:08.994
CHARLIE:
Uh, we haven't decided

42:09.027 --> 42:10.696
on what the rent is yet.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.164
I'll pay you with rib eyes
every Friday night.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.933
- Yeah, that sounds fair.
- CHARLIE: You'll be eating them

42:14.966 --> 42:16.935
while I'm 7,000 miles away.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.336
Hey, I'm your representative.
What do you got,

42:18.369 --> 42:19.871
like, a 50-inch plasma there?

42:19.905 --> 42:21.039
Uh, 60.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.574
- Sixty?
- Sixty?

42:22.608 --> 42:24.109
You're turning my garage
into a man cave.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.745
I like it. Might have to come by
once in a while.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.080
Tell us something we don't know.

42:29.114 --> 42:32.718
Everything changes,
everything's the same.

42:32.751 --> 42:37.222
* It's all for you

42:39.658 --> 42:42.560
* It's all for you

42:46.632 --> 42:51.302
* It's all for you.
