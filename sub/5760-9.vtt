00:08.484 --> 00:10.984
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.696 --> 00:15.573
I just got married,
just moved to a small town,

00:15.574 --> 00:17.700
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:17.701 --> 00:20.201
I might be just like you.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.580
Except from the time
that I was a little girl,

00:22.581 --> 00:25.750
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.751 --> 00:27.001
It's all right, honey.

00:27.002 --> 00:29.379
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

00:29.380 --> 00:30.755
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

00:30.756 --> 00:33.007
<i>because they have unfinished
business with the living.</i>

00:33.008 --> 00:35.728
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.844 --> 00:40.364
To tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.077
You know, I don't think that waiter
got your sense of humour.

01:01.078 --> 01:03.162
Yeah, I think it's because he was
looking at you so much,

01:03.163 --> 01:05.081
he didn't even hear me.

01:05.081 --> 01:07.166
Are you gonna pick up
your mom tomorrow at the train?

01:07.167 --> 01:10.086
No. No, no. She insists
on taking a cab, you know.

01:10.087 --> 01:11.670
She likes to think
she's low-maintenance.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.006
Ah, don't we all?

01:14.007 --> 01:16.342
She always has her reason.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.843
What?

01:19.221 --> 01:21.639
This is exactly where I parked the car.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.806
Are you sure?

01:22.807 --> 01:28.317
Yeah. Remember? When we almost
tripped over that crack there.

01:31.399 --> 01:34.235
I am not enjoying this moment.

01:36.821 --> 01:40.324
Evening. I need to report a stolen car.

01:40.325 --> 01:45.545
<i>415, Ovington Avenue.
Vehicle belongs to a Melinda Gordon.</i>

01:49.167 --> 01:50.584
That was quick work, Billy.

01:50.585 --> 01:52.336
Hey, slow night. What can I say?

01:52.337 --> 01:54.338
We caught him
running a stop sign a few blocks away.

01:54.339 --> 01:55.464
Oh, yeah?

01:55.465 --> 01:56.965
Damn near drove right over
the lawn of this house.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.592
A joyride, I'm guessing.

01:58.593 --> 02:00.302
A joyride of one?

02:00.303 --> 02:02.888
He's got a couple of misdemeanours,
no major priors.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.098
What you guys wanna do?

02:05.099 --> 02:06.850
Miles Jensen, the boy's father.

02:06.851 --> 02:08.518
I really apologise for this.

02:08.519 --> 02:12.105
My son, he's in that
troublemaker phase, I guess.

02:12.106 --> 02:14.274
No one was hurt.
That's all that matters.

02:14.275 --> 02:16.860
I know this is asking a lot,

02:16.861 --> 02:18.987
but would you consider
not pressing charges?

02:18.988 --> 02:21.488
I'll pay for the damage.

02:23.034 --> 02:25.534
Sure. Yeah. It's okay.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.621
I really appreciate that.

02:27.622 --> 02:30.207
I don't know what is with the kid.

02:30.208 --> 02:37.268
Sometimes I wish he'd wake up, be 21
and have all this teen crap behind him.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.431
Honey.

03:04.074 --> 03:06.694
He messed with your stations.

03:07.286 --> 03:10.486
We should prosecute. Let's go back.

03:10.498 --> 03:13.166
Hey, you know what my problem is?
I need to wake up, be 16

03:13.167 --> 03:16.207
and get over all this adult crap.

03:16.337 --> 03:19.057
Hold on. Pull over for a sec.

03:25.429 --> 03:27.680
What, are those
cell phone transmissions? What?

03:27.681 --> 03:29.140
I don't think so.

03:29.141 --> 03:30.975
I think these are spirit voices.

03:30.976 --> 03:32.769
Wait a minute. Normal guy.
How come I can hear them?

03:32.770 --> 03:34.187
I'm not sure.

03:34.188 --> 03:35.480
How do you know they're spirits?

03:35.481 --> 03:38.041
I feel it. I can feel them.

03:38.275 --> 03:39.817
What, the car's haunted?

03:39.818 --> 03:41.486
I don't know.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.614
I've never run into this before.
There's a name for it.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.115
Cool. I mean, creepy.

03:53.123 --> 03:55.207
Okay.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.503
<i>I am here.</i>

04:00.088 --> 04:02.588
<i>Can you see us?</i>

04:33.579 --> 04:38.239
Hello? Is there a handsome
paramedic in this house?

04:39.335 --> 04:41.711
<i>You have 4 messages.</i>

04:41.712 --> 04:43.671
<i>Your dry cleaning is ready.</i>

04:43.672 --> 04:44.881
<i>Hey, it"s Andrea.</i>

04:44.882 --> 04:48.259
<i>You were right about the estate sale
in LaKemont. Give me a call.</i>

04:48.260 --> 04:54.550
<i>Jim, it"s Tommy. Can you taKe
the 4:00 to 12:00 shift next Tuesday?</i>

05:10.365 --> 05:11.657
Hey.

05:11.658 --> 05:13.034
You all right?

05:13.035 --> 05:15.535
Do you hear that?

05:15.746 --> 05:19.446
Barely, but yeah. Don't know what it is.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.334
You okay?

05:21.335 --> 05:23.753
Yeah. Yeah, except for
a headache all of a sudden.

05:23.754 --> 05:25.588
All right.

05:25.589 --> 05:28.089
It'll be all right.

05:28.967 --> 05:33.577
You get a headache,
my mother arrives. Interesting.

05:34.723 --> 05:35.890
Hey.

05:35.891 --> 05:37.558
Hey, darling.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.351
I'm so happy to see you.

05:39.352 --> 05:40.811
It's great to see you, Mom.
How you doing?

05:40.812 --> 05:42.688
- Hi.
- Melinda, darling.

05:42.689 --> 05:44.899
Hey. Here you go, man. Thank you.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.609
- Thanks very much.
- Jim!

05:46.610 --> 05:49.653
- What?
- You just tipped my friend, Ellis.

05:49.654 --> 05:52.154
Sorry. Ellis Conway.

05:52.365 --> 05:54.074
This is my son, Jim.

05:54.075 --> 05:55.367
- Hiya there, Jimmy.
- Hey.

05:55.368 --> 05:56.952
And my beautiful
daughter-in-law, Melinda.

05:56.953 --> 05:58.495
Melinda. Heard a lot about you.

05:58.496 --> 05:59.830
Nice to meet you.

05:59.831 --> 06:04.671
Well, look, I got another bag to get.
Be right back.

06:04.753 --> 06:06.044
Isn't he sweet?

06:06.045 --> 06:07.254
Who is he?

06:07.255 --> 06:08.797
Well, you know who.

06:08.798 --> 06:10.174
I don't.

06:10.175 --> 06:12.134
He's my...

06:12.135 --> 06:14.470
Well, boyfriend is just
ridiculous, isn't it?

06:14.471 --> 06:16.680
He's a special friend.

06:16.681 --> 06:18.974
Boyfriend. Mom,
you didn't mention this.

06:18.975 --> 06:21.602
Didn't I? Melinda, you look wonderful.

06:21.603 --> 06:23.979
And you, Faith, you're just glowing.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.147
Mom...

06:25.148 --> 06:28.275
Jim, please don't be boring about this.
I'll explain more later.

06:28.276 --> 06:30.193
What a fantastic house, gee.

06:30.194 --> 06:32.446
- Yeah. Great. I got it.
- Thanks.

06:32.447 --> 06:33.655
Here, darling.

06:33.656 --> 06:36.156
Okay, well...

06:36.743 --> 06:37.909
Anyone hungry?

06:37.910 --> 06:40.410
Yeah. Sure.

06:40.705 --> 06:42.622
This is yummy.

06:42.623 --> 06:45.123
Wonderful.

06:46.919 --> 06:49.754
Hey. You're supposed to pay for those.

06:49.755 --> 06:51.548
Keeping track.

06:51.549 --> 06:54.926
All right. What's up with you and Ellis?

06:54.927 --> 06:56.261
What about me and Ellis?

06:56.262 --> 07:00.042
You haven't
spoken two words to the guy.

07:00.308 --> 07:02.808
It's nothing.

07:03.102 --> 07:04.811
Does it bother you
that him and your mom...

07:04.812 --> 07:08.315
Hey, hey, hey. Do we have to
put a name on it, huh?

07:08.316 --> 07:10.442
I don't get it.
He seems like a perfectly nice guy.

07:10.443 --> 07:13.945
Then how come he's checking out that
blonde who is clearly not my mother?

07:13.946 --> 07:18.658
Because, Jim, that blonde
is a Nordic goddess with huge

07:18.659 --> 07:19.993
pastries.

07:19.994 --> 07:22.120
A priest would be forgiven for glancing.

07:22.121 --> 07:24.789
That's not a glance.
That's a leer. Come on.

07:24.790 --> 07:27.542
I don't know. It just...
Something doesn't feel right.

07:27.543 --> 07:30.128
Has your mom dated anybody
since your dad passed away?

07:30.129 --> 07:31.963
Not that I know of.

07:31.964 --> 07:34.464
Say no more.

07:40.973 --> 07:42.807
I can't believe

07:42.808 --> 07:45.226
you tried to put their bags
in separate rooms.

07:45.227 --> 07:46.853
- Hey!
- I was kidding.

07:46.854 --> 07:48.521
They are adults.

07:48.522 --> 07:51.566
I don't know. Something about
this Ellis guy just doesn't seem right.

07:51.567 --> 07:54.861
You know how they met? He was
installing her new alarm system.

07:54.862 --> 07:56.696
He seems sweet and charming to me.

07:56.697 --> 07:59.657
Yeah, yeah, if you like
that sort of thing.

07:59.658 --> 08:01.451
What is this really about?

08:01.452 --> 08:03.786
I don't know. It's just...
You know what it is?

08:03.787 --> 08:05.621
He's too nice. I'm not buying it.

08:05.622 --> 08:07.373
Oh. Cynical.

08:07.374 --> 08:09.884
Dad's been dead five years.

08:13.755 --> 08:16.132
He's just...
He's really different from my dad.

08:16.133 --> 08:18.759
You know, maybe you should just
get used to the idea that your mother

08:18.760 --> 08:21.260
is dating.

08:22.681 --> 08:24.849
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.183
Damn headache.

08:26.184 --> 08:28.185
Give me that.
Is it the same as the ones before?

08:28.186 --> 08:31.188
Yeah. There were weird voices again
on the answering machine.

08:31.189 --> 08:34.900
I listened to them twice
and I've been sick all night.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.400
Don't listen to them.

08:38.363 --> 08:40.780
That is so male. I love that.

08:40.782 --> 08:42.658
It seems simple to me.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.451
Look, are you sure these things
aren't explainable,

08:44.452 --> 08:46.954
- I mean, like cell phone transmissions?
- No, they're not.

08:46.955 --> 08:49.331
You know how I can sense spirits,

08:49.332 --> 08:51.125
like I can feel what they're feeling?

08:51.126 --> 08:55.421
Now I'm on overload.
It's like tasting too many foods at once.

08:55.422 --> 08:58.882
I don't like this is making you sick.

08:59.050 --> 09:01.510
Should I get you some aspirin?

09:01.511 --> 09:04.930
You know what always makes
my headaches go away?

09:04.931 --> 09:07.431
Oh, yeah.

09:26.578 --> 09:29.205
Wait. Hold those doors.

09:29.289 --> 09:31.789
Please. Thank you.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.459
Thanks. You're a pal.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.795
Probably saved me
about a half an hour.

09:36.796 --> 09:38.005
Which floor?

09:38.006 --> 09:40.506
Well, same as you.

09:41.134 --> 09:42.592
Are you here to see Dr Huffman?

09:42.593 --> 09:44.386
- How did you know?
- Psychic.

09:44.387 --> 09:47.305
That, and there's only one office
on the third floor.

09:47.306 --> 09:50.435
Which makes you Dr Huffman.

09:51.269 --> 09:52.602
You seem a little surprised.

09:52.603 --> 09:57.043
Oh, no. No. I'm sorry.
It's just... You sounded

09:57.191 --> 09:58.859
- older on the phone.
- Yeah.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.193
I've actually had a lot of blind dates

10:00.194 --> 10:03.321
which began with that same phrasing.

10:03.322 --> 10:06.241
Melinda Gordon. We talked
this morning about my messages.

10:06.242 --> 10:08.869
Oh, yes! Of course.

10:09.537 --> 10:11.329
Electronic voice phenomenon.

10:11.330 --> 10:13.748
EVP, as we noise geeks like to say.

10:13.749 --> 10:15.292
Well, how much do you know about it?

10:15.293 --> 10:17.168
Oh, not much.
Just what I learnt on the net.

10:17.169 --> 10:19.379
Your name kept coming up
in my searches.

10:19.380 --> 10:23.175
You seem to be the go-to guy for EVP.

10:23.259 --> 10:27.470
Yet the chairman of my department
remains unimpressed.

10:27.471 --> 10:29.305
Would you care for some cheese?

10:29.306 --> 10:30.682
Smoked Gouda.

10:30.683 --> 10:33.477
Oh. I'm good. Thanks.

10:33.727 --> 10:36.896
So do you mostly work
in paranormal studies?

10:36.897 --> 10:39.858
Well, I don't think of it as paranormal.

10:39.859 --> 10:43.695
I'm simply trying to apply
scientific explanation

10:43.696 --> 10:45.822
to phenomena
that seem unexplainable.

10:45.823 --> 10:47.490
Is EVP common?

10:47.491 --> 10:50.034
Hard to know.
We don't exactly keep statistics.

10:50.035 --> 10:52.829
Most of the voices seem to mostly
come through the vacant bandwidth

10:52.830 --> 10:54.914
between regular broadcast stations.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.624
But it's not just radio, you know.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.959
It could happen
with anything electronic.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.338
TVs, monitors, VCRs, et cetera.

11:01.422 --> 11:05.591
Most people really don't know
exactly how or why it works.

11:05.592 --> 11:09.262
Most people believe
it's caused by ghosts.

11:09.263 --> 11:11.472
Do you believe in ghosts?

11:11.473 --> 11:12.682
Do you?

11:12.683 --> 11:14.267
I'd answer that truthfully,

11:14.268 --> 11:15.893
but I may be endangering my tenure.

11:15.894 --> 11:20.464
Let's just say I...
I like to keep an open mind.

11:21.108 --> 11:23.609
Now, you said you have messages.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.861
Oh. Yes.

11:25.862 --> 11:28.823
The voices are hidden
under my other messages.

11:28.824 --> 11:32.974
And I'm also hearing voices
on my car radio.

11:33.537 --> 11:36.037
Here.

11:41.795 --> 11:45.548
Good call on the cheese, by the way.
It's dreadful.

11:45.549 --> 11:46.882
It's just been driving me crazy

11:46.883 --> 11:49.343
that I can't understand
what's being said.

11:49.344 --> 11:53.284
See, there's a lot of warping.
Watch this.

11:56.643 --> 11:58.561
Very typical.

11:58.562 --> 12:00.854
Most of the voices seem
to be in mid-conversation,

12:00.855 --> 12:02.856
some asking questions.

12:02.857 --> 12:05.484
There's one female voice
which seems to pop.

12:05.485 --> 12:06.986
She doesn't seem to be in conversation

12:06.987 --> 12:10.864
as much as trying
to get someone to hear her.

12:10.865 --> 12:12.449
You suddenly seem unwell.

12:12.450 --> 12:13.951
No, I'm good.

12:13.952 --> 12:17.812
Can you just tell me
what they're saying?

12:23.086 --> 12:25.586
<i>I am...</i>

12:26.840 --> 12:29.340
<i>I am waiting...</i>

12:30.385 --> 12:32.885
<i>I am waiting for you.</i>

12:35.223 --> 12:38.267
And you think these voices
are making you sick?

12:38.268 --> 12:39.476
It's not so much the voices.

12:39.477 --> 12:42.437
It's just a lot of spirit
stuff happening all at once.

12:42.438 --> 12:43.647
I feel like my head's vibrating.

12:43.648 --> 12:46.608
You are looking
a little green around the gills.

12:46.609 --> 12:48.402
You look good, too.

12:48.403 --> 12:50.654
Why don't you just go home?
You know, I can handle things here.

12:50.655 --> 12:53.455
Don't be ridiculous. I'm fine.

13:19.850 --> 13:23.270
<i>Claremont in the woods.</i>

13:25.356 --> 13:27.315
Claremont?

13:27.316 --> 13:29.985
I'm sorry. I have to go.

13:49.421 --> 13:51.921
Now what?

14:19.867 --> 14:23.328
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

14:23.329 --> 14:25.038
Who am I?

14:25.039 --> 14:26.623
I'm the woman whose car you stole.

14:26.624 --> 14:28.500
And you should try being polite.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.503
Thanks to me,
you're not stuck in jail right now.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.796
Answer my question.

14:32.797 --> 14:35.924
You first. What are you doing here?

14:35.925 --> 14:38.510
I'm walking. It's a trail, man.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.470
Were you led here, too?

14:40.471 --> 14:43.598
What are you talking about?
Led here by who?

14:43.599 --> 14:45.642
Someone told me to come here.

14:45.643 --> 14:48.523
A woman. Did she tell you, too?

14:49.271 --> 14:52.601
You hear the voices, too, don't you?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.443
You're...

14:55.444 --> 14:56.694
You're nuts, okay?

14:56.695 --> 15:00.315
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:08.832 --> 15:11.042
You don't have to do this.
I'll feel better in the morning.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.795
Of course I do. I can't sleep anyhow.

15:13.796 --> 15:16.676
Don't tell me you're obsessing.

15:17.466 --> 15:19.133
What if he's a gold digger?

15:19.134 --> 15:20.885
I mean, what if he's just
after her money?

15:20.886 --> 15:23.388
This is a class thing, isn't it?

15:23.389 --> 15:25.098
I think you know me better than that.

15:25.099 --> 15:28.309
Come on, admit it. You don't think he's
good enough for your mother.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.644
It's not that.

15:29.645 --> 15:32.145
What then?

15:33.148 --> 15:37.428
I don't think he's
good enough for my mother.

15:37.611 --> 15:38.903
Feel better?

15:38.904 --> 15:42.740
I felt better hours ago.
I've been totally milking it.

15:42.741 --> 15:45.241
That's my girl.

15:46.745 --> 15:50.155
You know... Can I ask you a question?

15:54.878 --> 15:58.881
You've been through a lot
with this whole spirit game, right?

15:58.882 --> 16:00.091
We both have.

16:00.092 --> 16:04.178
True enough. But I've never seen it
make you sick before.

16:04.179 --> 16:06.514
Don't make it bigger than it is,
you know.

16:06.515 --> 16:08.557
I just can't get control of this one.

16:08.558 --> 16:11.186
My point. It's a bad thing.

16:12.312 --> 16:13.604
Look, do you ever think
there'll be a day

16:13.605 --> 16:15.189
where you can say,

16:15.190 --> 16:18.359
you know, "Sorry. I can't help you.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.777
"You're not good for me.

16:19.778 --> 16:24.073
"You're making me sick.
You're making me cry"?

16:24.074 --> 16:27.484
Do you think that day will ever come?

16:27.786 --> 16:30.286
I don't know. Should it?

16:35.251 --> 16:39.254
I'm gonna go downstairs and get
a glass of water. You want anything?

16:39.255 --> 16:41.048
Wisdom and patience.

16:41.049 --> 16:43.008
Always in short supply.

16:43.009 --> 16:48.459
Saltine crackers are gonna have to do
and those are for me.

17:04.196 --> 17:06.696
<i>MaKe him listen.</i>

17:07.492 --> 17:09.992
Who are you?

17:10.494 --> 17:13.580
<i>MaKe him listen!</i>

17:13.664 --> 17:16.164
Who are the other voices?

17:22.757 --> 17:25.666
<i>You were there. You did nothing!</i>

17:28.763 --> 17:31.263
<i>L"m waiting...</i>

17:38.856 --> 17:41.066
What's going on?

17:41.067 --> 17:42.317
Hey.

17:42.318 --> 17:43.568
I'm sorry.

17:43.569 --> 17:44.861
It's all right. You all right?

17:44.862 --> 17:48.907
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

17:48.908 --> 17:51.408
Come on.

17:53.829 --> 17:56.329
<i>Go bacK. Go bacK.</i>

18:41.793 --> 18:43.586
What are you trying to tell me?

18:43.587 --> 18:46.087
<i>My son.</i>

18:46.256 --> 18:48.756
<i>My son.</i>

18:52.304 --> 18:54.263
<i>My son.</i>

18:54.264 --> 18:57.644
<i>Where is he? You"ve got to tell him.</i>

19:25.337 --> 19:26.879
Hi.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.714
Damn. I forgot to send
the cheque for the car.

19:28.715 --> 19:30.132
You know, I can do that right now.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.259
No, no, no, no. The insurance
company's taking care of it.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.345
I just wanted to come by
and check on Kirk.

19:34.346 --> 19:35.554
Kirk.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.181
Yeah. Just see how he's doing.

19:37.182 --> 19:39.850
You said you weren't
going to press charges.

19:39.851 --> 19:41.435
Honestly, I'm not.

19:41.436 --> 19:43.520
I just, I don't know,
wanted to talk to him.

19:43.521 --> 19:46.440
You know, make sure there was
no hard feelings.

19:46.441 --> 19:49.109
Are you a social worker or something?

19:49.110 --> 19:52.154
I get that a lot. Not really. No.

19:52.155 --> 19:54.907
Well, it's nice of you to take an interest.

19:54.908 --> 19:57.784
But he's not here. He's never here.

19:57.785 --> 19:58.952
Where does he go?

19:58.953 --> 20:01.830
I'm not privy
to that information any more.

20:01.831 --> 20:03.999
It's just the two of you?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.167
Excuse me?

20:05.168 --> 20:07.044
Oh, I was just wondering.

20:07.045 --> 20:10.714
My wife passed away,
if that's what you're asking.

20:10.715 --> 20:13.258
You know, my son
was a good kid until then.

20:13.259 --> 20:15.427
Made good grades. He was happy.

20:15.428 --> 20:19.718
When his mother passed away,
he just spiralled.

20:20.058 --> 20:23.185
All of a sudden,
it was drugs and petty crime.

20:23.186 --> 20:25.353
You know, he doesn't say a word,
not to me or anyone else.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.355
And believe me, I try.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.565
I really try.

20:28.566 --> 20:29.774
I'm sorry.

20:29.775 --> 20:31.151
Anyway, I got to catch a plane.

20:31.152 --> 20:33.069
Right.

20:33.070 --> 20:35.363
Hey, I'm sorry to hold you up.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.615
Can I just leave a card?

20:36.616 --> 20:38.366
You know, just in case
he does wanna talk.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.911
You are a social worker, aren't you?

20:40.912 --> 20:42.412
Maybe you're right.

20:42.413 --> 20:46.958
Go ahead. He'll probably come home
when he's sure I'm gone.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.377
Excuse me.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.878
How did his mother die?

20:52.923 --> 20:56.863
It was an accident.
She died in the woods.

21:06.604 --> 21:09.104
<i>Find the red...</i>

21:09.565 --> 21:11.691
<i>Find the red glove.</i>

21:11.692 --> 21:15.321
<i>Red glove.</i>

21:15.404 --> 21:18.115
<i>Find the red glove.</i>

21:18.240 --> 21:20.116
<i>Red glove.</i>

21:20.117 --> 21:22.617
<i>Red glove.</i>

21:42.488 --> 21:43.989
- Billy.
- Hey, Jimmy.

21:43.990 --> 21:45.699
Doing a training thing here
or something?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.576
- No. Actually, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure, come on.

21:47.577 --> 21:50.328
You're not gonna try to Heimlich me
or something, are you?

21:50.329 --> 21:52.163
Maybe if you're lucky, next time.

21:52.164 --> 21:53.373
What you need, baby?

21:53.374 --> 21:56.459
Look, I wouldn't ask you this
if I wasn't...

21:56.460 --> 21:57.711
What?

21:57.712 --> 22:00.922
Well, my mom started seeing this guy.

22:00.923 --> 22:03.007
And I don't know.
Just got a weird feeling about him.

22:03.008 --> 22:04.217
Weird how?

22:04.218 --> 22:05.468
I don't know, Billy.

22:05.469 --> 22:07.303
I was just wondering if you could
run a check on him.

22:07.304 --> 22:08.555
He lives in Philadelphia.

22:08.556 --> 22:10.140
Philadelphia. Wow.

22:10.141 --> 22:12.142
I don't know what I can get from here.

22:12.143 --> 22:15.144
Maybe DMV. Maybe some
court records. It'd be a shot in the dark.

22:15.145 --> 22:16.729
I'd appreciate anything you could do.

22:16.730 --> 22:17.939
Okay, well...

22:17.940 --> 22:21.234
What's wrong with you guys?
Cutbacks?

22:21.235 --> 22:24.385
- What's his name?
- Ellis Conway.

22:24.905 --> 22:27.925
He's an electrician. Philadelphia.

22:29.243 --> 22:32.996
Oh, it is so cute.
He's all twitchy about Faith's boyfriend.

22:32.997 --> 22:34.288
Thank you.

22:34.289 --> 22:35.623
He seems like such a nice guy.

22:35.624 --> 22:37.458
Oh, he is. He really is.

22:37.459 --> 22:38.751
But, you know, it's Jim's mom,

22:38.752 --> 22:40.837
and he's always gonna look after her.

22:40.838 --> 22:42.255
She's a little impulsive.

22:42.256 --> 22:45.456
Oh, that's great. I love impulsive.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.400
Hey! Stop!

23:07.155 --> 23:09.655
Hi.

23:13.161 --> 23:15.661
Can you make this stop?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.167
<i>Red glove.</i>

23:20.168 --> 23:22.668
<i>Red glove.</i>

23:23.630 --> 23:26.090
<i>Red glove.</i>

23:26.091 --> 23:27.883
Who do you think it is?

23:27.884 --> 23:30.886
I don't care who it is.
I just want it to stop.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.447
It's your mother, isn't it?

23:36.309 --> 23:37.851
What did your mother do?

23:37.852 --> 23:41.105
She was an electrical engineer.
Designed circuit boards.

23:41.106 --> 23:42.606
What difference does that make?

23:42.607 --> 23:45.359
So she knew a lot about electronics.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.568
I guess.

23:46.569 --> 23:49.154
Spirits need our energy to manifest.

23:49.155 --> 23:51.657
She's out in the woods.
There's no one there for her to draw on.

23:51.658 --> 23:56.286
She's probably trying to communicate
on the only thing that's familiar.

23:56.287 --> 23:57.871
How do you know all this?

23:57.872 --> 24:01.572
It's what I do. The spirit part, anyway.

24:01.626 --> 24:04.044
Look, I think your mother's
trying to get a message to you.

24:04.045 --> 24:05.504
And she's there. She's waiting for you.

24:05.505 --> 24:07.130
I don't want any messages from her.

24:07.131 --> 24:10.011
I just want the voices to stop.

24:10.385 --> 24:13.804
You said you could help me, so do it.

24:13.805 --> 24:17.455
Do you know anything
about a red glove?

24:22.522 --> 24:24.773
My mother's a liar.

24:24.774 --> 24:29.744
I don't want anything
to do with her, living or dead.

24:53.844 --> 24:57.124
What happened to you in these woods?

25:00.434 --> 25:03.688
<i>An autumn day. Beautiful sun.</i>

25:05.606 --> 25:09.485
<i>Everything felt so good, so right.</i>

25:11.362 --> 25:14.242
<i>Free. I felt liKe a girl again.</i>

25:15.074 --> 25:17.158
<i>He did that for me.</i>

25:17.159 --> 25:19.659
<i>We met years ago.</i>

25:19.662 --> 25:21.788
<i>We were friends, that"s all.</i>

25:21.789 --> 25:26.999
<i>But my marriage was so cold,
and Bob made me feel loved.</i>

25:27.920 --> 25:30.420
<i>It was just a little fall.</i>

25:31.674 --> 25:34.174
<i>Didn"t hurt.</i>

25:45.270 --> 25:50.480
<i>There was a broKen power line
at the bottom of the well.</i>

25:50.526 --> 25:51.943
<i>I had been electrocuted.</i>

25:51.944 --> 25:53.152
Lacy!

25:53.153 --> 25:56.239
<i>I was dead before
I could even yell or shout out.</i>

25:56.240 --> 25:58.740
Help! Help!

25:58.992 --> 26:01.492
<i>How could I explain?</i>

26:03.205 --> 26:07.375
<i>My son KirK trusted me.
He would never understand.</i>

26:07.376 --> 26:09.876
<i>That"s when everybody Knew.</i>

26:10.045 --> 26:13.172
<i>- Knew what?
- That we were lovers.</i>

26:13.173 --> 26:15.216
<i>We were having an affair.</i>

26:15.217 --> 26:18.886
<i>My family was devastated.
And everyone felt betrayed.</i>

26:18.887 --> 26:21.806
<i>Even my son KirK lost faith in me.</i>

26:21.807 --> 26:23.474
<i>He was so angry.</i>

26:23.475 --> 26:25.476
<i>He started wasting his talent.</i>

26:25.477 --> 26:26.685
What about his father?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.437
<i>Miles doesn"t understand.</i>

26:28.438 --> 26:29.855
Doesn't understand what?

26:29.856 --> 26:33.346
<i>The red glove. He doesn"t Know that...</i>

26:37.447 --> 26:39.947
Red glove.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.606
<i>Hi. This is the Jensens.
Leave us a message.</i>

26:48.607 --> 26:50.316
Hey, Kirk, it's Melinda Gordon again.

26:50.317 --> 26:53.319
If I could just talk to you for, like,
five minutes. It's really important.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.905
If you could just
call my store or my cell.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.406
Thank you.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.660
Hey. Are you okay? You look worried.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.912
Yeah. I guess I'm always
worried about something.

27:02.913 --> 27:06.499
Here. You chop these,
and I will take care of the rest.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.252
This is fun. You know,
I never come home for lunch.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.045
Now I know why Jim's
such a good cook.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.507
To tell you the truth, I learnt
more from him than he did from me.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.802
He has always been interested in food.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.305
Let's hope he gives
poor Ellis a few crumbs at least.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.182
Does it bother you?

27:23.183 --> 27:26.435
It's what I expected, pretty much.
He's very protective.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.063
But he'll come round.
Ellis can win anybody over.

27:29.064 --> 27:33.609
You know, I have to admit.
I envy what you and Jim have.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.777
I wish that my mother and I...

27:34.778 --> 27:37.688
Whoa. Careful what you wish for.

27:37.781 --> 27:42.041
It's not easy,
especially the growing-up part.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.786
I can't even count the number of times

27:43.787 --> 27:45.913
we were furious with each other.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.959
Still happens. But he always knew
someone had his back.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.046
He always knew someone
was out there who understood him.

27:54.047 --> 27:57.341
Well, you and Jim have quite a bond.
Nothing's gonna change that.

27:57.342 --> 28:02.972
Now we just have to make him see that
Ellis isn't trying to.

28:10.563 --> 28:11.689
That was fast.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.649
Hey, if it was my mom's,
I'd be fast too, now.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.776
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, no, no. Look, I got to run.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.945
- All right, what do you got?
- Plenty, and it isn't good.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.280
Look, you call me later if there's
anything else you want me to do.

28:20.281 --> 28:25.841
- All right, Billy, thanks. I owe you one.
- Hey, no problem.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.737
<i>Son.</i>

29:11.499 --> 29:14.502
<i>I love you.</i>

29:35.439 --> 29:38.609
<i>Please, stop hurting yourself.</i>

29:45.699 --> 29:47.033
Mom.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.684
<i>Please, stop hurting yourself.</i>

29:50.120 --> 29:52.372
<i>- I love you.
- Mom!</i>

29:52.373 --> 29:54.873
Please! No!

30:04.385 --> 30:06.219
- You again?
- Is Kirk here?

30:06.220 --> 30:08.137
You have amazing timing,
I'll give you that.

30:08.138 --> 30:09.263
What's wrong?

30:09.264 --> 30:11.683
Welcome to my son's
latest crime spree.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.309
He just broke into an electronics store

30:13.310 --> 30:14.852
and trashed the place or something.

30:14.853 --> 30:16.396
Oh, is there anything I can do?

30:16.397 --> 30:20.441
You know, it's almost like he waits until
he knows I'm at my busiest

30:20.442 --> 30:21.734
before he pulls this crap.

30:21.735 --> 30:24.445
I doubt that it has anything
to do with you, Mr Jensen.

30:24.446 --> 30:27.532
Well, please, tell me, what is it about?

30:27.533 --> 30:29.826
He's grieving. He lost his mother.

30:29.827 --> 30:34.789
I lost, too. Talk about having the
rug pulled out from underneath you.

30:34.790 --> 30:36.207
You know,
I've done my best for that kid.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.209
I taught him to be tough,
with a thick skin.

30:38.210 --> 30:40.127
How else can you survive in this worid?

30:40.128 --> 30:44.898
Instead he throws garbage cans
through store windows.

30:47.302 --> 30:50.582
Oh, Mr Jensen, you left your door...

30:51.431 --> 30:53.931
...open.

30:56.812 --> 31:00.524
<i>Right here. Come.</i>

31:24.839 --> 31:27.339
<i>Find it.</i>

31:29.052 --> 31:31.552
<i>Find it here.</i>

31:46.277 --> 31:48.403
<i>Red glove.</i>

31:48.404 --> 31:51.741
<i>Underneath, where it should be.</i>

31:52.659 --> 31:54.451
<i>Mattress.</i>

31:54.452 --> 31:56.952
<i>Red glove, find it.</i>

32:21.229 --> 32:26.119
Excuse me, can I have a moment?
It's my son. Thanks.

32:26.901 --> 32:30.528
Why are you doing this?
I mean, is it that bad?

32:30.529 --> 32:33.281
I told you I'd send you
to a psychiatrist or a counsellor.

32:33.282 --> 32:34.866
Maybe if you actually
talked to somebody.

32:34.867 --> 32:36.284
But you can't keep doing this.

32:36.285 --> 32:39.871
Well, you let me know
when you find me somebody to talk to.

32:39.872 --> 32:42.372
All right, son, let's go.

32:56.138 --> 32:58.638
Thank you.

33:02.144 --> 33:03.394
What are you doing here?

33:03.395 --> 33:05.438
They told me no one's bailed you out.

33:05.439 --> 33:08.399
Yeah. He's teaching me a lesson.

33:09.485 --> 33:12.111
Nothing like doing
some hard time in the Grandview jail

33:12.112 --> 33:13.655
to turn a guy around.

33:13.656 --> 33:14.906
I'm sorry.

33:14.907 --> 33:17.492
It's fine. At least
I'll get a good night's sleep.

33:17.493 --> 33:19.494
They don't allow anything
electronic in here.

33:19.495 --> 33:22.872
I know what happened
with your mother.

33:22.873 --> 33:23.998
How?

33:23.999 --> 33:26.292
She told me.

33:26.293 --> 33:27.668
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

33:27.669 --> 33:30.919
She knows how angry you are at her.

33:32.174 --> 33:33.299
I doubt it.

33:33.300 --> 33:35.968
People make mistakes.
She feels badly.

33:35.969 --> 33:39.014
She should feel bad. She lied.

33:39.723 --> 33:41.599
I know why she had
to lie to my old man.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.726
But why did she have to lie to me?

33:43.727 --> 33:46.877
I told her everything about myself.

33:49.733 --> 33:53.235
She didn't love him.
Well, maybe she didn't love me, either.

33:53.236 --> 33:55.279
You know that's not true.

33:55.280 --> 33:59.116
Look, sometimes we don't understand
why people do what they do.

33:59.117 --> 34:02.137
Everybody fights their own battle.

34:03.955 --> 34:07.125
We may not even know what that is.

34:12.422 --> 34:13.964
Where the hell did you get this?

34:13.965 --> 34:16.465
She led me to it.

34:19.512 --> 34:21.013
You know what it's about?

34:21.014 --> 34:22.556
It's about a young man
who doesn't know

34:22.556 --> 34:26.016
how to tell his father that he's gay.

34:36.353 --> 34:38.688
Bailing me out
doesn't make up for what you did.

34:38.688 --> 34:39.981
Maybe to me it does.

34:39.982 --> 34:41.149
You had no right to read this.

34:41.150 --> 34:43.735
It was beautiful. It made me cry.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.529
And it was obviously
written by somebody with a great heart.

34:46.530 --> 34:47.906
You should keep writing.

34:47.907 --> 34:49.657
Look, it's none of your business.

34:49.658 --> 34:50.992
Who the hell are you anyway?

34:50.993 --> 34:52.659
Why are you even involved with this?

34:52.661 --> 34:55.455
Because it was my car
you chose to steal.

34:55.456 --> 34:58.286
And maybe that was no accident.

34:59.585 --> 35:01.377
Does your father know that you write?

35:01.378 --> 35:02.920
What do you think?

35:02.921 --> 35:05.298
Well, why not?

35:05.299 --> 35:09.269
He wouldn't understand,
and neither do you.

35:11.013 --> 35:13.973
Look, thanks for the bail.
I'll pay you back.

35:13.974 --> 35:15.516
Thank your father.

35:15.517 --> 35:18.644
He was the one that gave me
permissión to pick you up.

35:18.645 --> 35:21.273
Fantastic. I'm out of here.

35:31.283 --> 35:32.533
Check, sir.

35:32.534 --> 35:33.826
Thank you.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.996
I was sure I wouldn't get any good
Italian food out here.

35:36.997 --> 35:39.457
I was wrong. No, I got it.

35:39.458 --> 35:43.978
You're a man of few words, Jimmy.
I admire that.

35:44.588 --> 35:46.797
How long have you been
an electrician, Ellis?

35:46.798 --> 35:48.174
Electric...

35:48.175 --> 35:51.969
Well, I've been in the business
a good 14, 15 years now.

35:51.970 --> 35:54.930
Really? Ever done
anything on the side?

35:54.931 --> 35:57.183
On the side?

35:57.184 --> 35:59.018
I keep myself busy enough.

35:59.019 --> 36:00.978
I bet you do.

36:00.979 --> 36:02.688
I don't think I get you.

36:02.689 --> 36:05.869
Writing bad cheques, Internet scams,

36:06.151 --> 36:08.485
telephone fraud.

36:08.486 --> 36:11.905
My mother know you spent two years
in a federal prison?

36:11.906 --> 36:14.416
You checking up on me, Jim?

36:14.492 --> 36:17.292
I'm checking up on you, Ellis.

36:18.121 --> 36:20.621
May I see that?

36:24.836 --> 36:26.003
Right.

36:26.004 --> 36:28.754
Well, you see, a problem here.

36:28.965 --> 36:31.967
I go by "Ellis,"
but that's my middle name.

36:31.968 --> 36:34.678
My real name is Vincent.
Vinny Conway.

36:34.679 --> 36:38.098
This here "Ellis Conway,"
that's somebody else.

36:38.099 --> 36:40.726
So, why don't you go back to your guy

36:40.727 --> 36:43.103
and you give him the name
"Vincent E. Conway,"

36:43.104 --> 36:45.439
see what he comes up with.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.940
You know, Jimmy?
Your mother warned me about you.

36:50.111 --> 36:52.611
Hey, wait a minute.

36:53.489 --> 36:55.574
What? So, what, did you
change your name or something?

36:55.575 --> 36:58.952
I didn't change it.
I just dropped it. Thank you.

36:58.953 --> 37:00.912
Look, when I got my business started,

37:00.913 --> 37:05.500
I thought going by "Ellis" would
make me sound more high-class.

37:05.501 --> 37:10.964
You know how narrow-minded some
people could be about these things.

37:10.965 --> 37:14.010
Look, Jimmy, I understand. I do.

37:14.343 --> 37:16.428
Your mother's a wonderful woman.
We both know that.

37:16.429 --> 37:21.109
But she's been hurt,
she's lost, she's vulnerable.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.853
You're looking out for her.
That's something else I admire.

37:24.854 --> 37:27.731
Ellis, I don't know where
to begin to apologise.

37:27.732 --> 37:31.818
Forget it, huh? I've been
through a few things myself, you know.

37:31.819 --> 37:35.947
Ups and downs in business.
First wife passed away.

37:35.948 --> 37:38.950
Yeah, we all have
our wounds, kid. Right?

37:38.951 --> 37:42.787
Not as big as the one
I'd like to inflict on myself right now.

37:42.788 --> 37:45.081
I may not be a college guy,

37:45.082 --> 37:48.992
but I've made
some good moves in my time.

37:49.378 --> 37:52.213
Meeting your mom was one of them.

37:52.214 --> 37:54.215
Hey, wanna go get some ice cream?

37:54.216 --> 37:55.550
I say we get some ice cream.

37:55.551 --> 37:59.637
Then let's go get some ice cream.
And you can pay.

37:59.638 --> 38:03.057
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you bailed the kid out.

38:03.058 --> 38:05.476
I couldn't just let him
sit there in that cage.

38:05.477 --> 38:08.646
It didn't cost that much. Are you mad?

38:08.647 --> 38:11.147
Mad? Let me see.

38:12.401 --> 38:15.945
Just when I think I can't
possibly love you more,

38:15.946 --> 38:18.446
you prove me wrong.

38:18.657 --> 38:21.367
Can you imagine having
to keep a secret like that

38:21.368 --> 38:23.828
from the one person who's
supposed to love you no matter what?

38:23.829 --> 38:25.413
Speaking of secrets...

38:25.414 --> 38:27.914
<i>415, Ovington.</i>

38:30.961 --> 38:32.670
<i>415, Ovington.</i>

38:32.671 --> 38:35.173
<i>KirK. KirK. KirK.</i>

38:35.799 --> 38:37.174
How do I know that address?

38:37.175 --> 38:38.509
It was on the police report.

38:38.510 --> 38:41.262
That's where
the kid took our car when he stole it.

38:41.263 --> 38:43.055
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you. Are you kidding?

38:43.056 --> 38:45.558
We can't both leave in
the middle of the night. It'll look weird.

38:45.559 --> 38:47.309
I'll call you if I need your help.

38:47.310 --> 38:48.436
<i>Hurry!</i>

38:48.437 --> 38:50.937
I'll be fine.

38:56.945 --> 38:58.320
Hey, what are you doing here?

38:58.321 --> 38:59.780
This is his house.

38:59.781 --> 39:03.117
This is where my mother
really wanted to be, with her lover.

39:03.118 --> 39:05.077
Come on. Don't do this. Just talk to me.

39:05.078 --> 39:07.830
Don't worry.
He doesn't live here any more.

39:07.831 --> 39:11.041
The man my mother really loved,
he moved away.

39:11.042 --> 39:12.668
Hey.

39:12.669 --> 39:15.759
She knows how mad you are at her.

39:15.797 --> 39:17.673
She knows how much
the affair hurt you.

39:17.674 --> 39:20.217
But it's not just that, is it?

39:20.218 --> 39:23.721
She says you hurt
even more than you know.

39:23.722 --> 39:27.475
Really? More hurt
than even I know? Wow.

39:27.559 --> 39:29.184
That's a lot of hurt.

39:29.185 --> 39:31.019
And you hurt because
she was the only one

39:31.020 --> 39:35.840
who could possibly understand you.
She had your back.

39:40.363 --> 39:42.873
It wasn't her fault, right?

39:43.449 --> 39:45.949
The dying part, at least.

39:47.829 --> 39:50.499
She wanted you to have peace.

39:51.958 --> 39:54.084
She was like my map, you know.

39:54.085 --> 39:55.544
She could always
figure out where I was

39:55.545 --> 40:00.091
or where I wanted to go
just by talking to her.

40:03.094 --> 40:05.894
Even when I felt like a freak,

40:07.140 --> 40:10.392
she could look at me and I knew that

40:10.393 --> 40:14.523
everything was gonna be okay,
no matter what.

40:15.481 --> 40:17.981
And I believed her.

40:20.987 --> 40:23.497
I never got to say goodbye.

40:29.662 --> 40:32.162
Can I talk to her?

40:32.498 --> 40:34.666
She's here.

40:34.667 --> 40:39.217
She can feel your love.
It's giving her strength.

40:42.925 --> 40:45.425
I miss you so much.

40:46.345 --> 40:48.845
I feel so lost.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.352
Who's gonna tell me
that everything's gonna be okay now?

40:54.353 --> 40:57.398
You will. That's what she wants.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.901
You can keep her alive
in everything that you write.

41:01.902 --> 41:04.237
<i>L"m so proud of him.</i>

41:04.238 --> 41:08.449
And she wants you to know
that she's proud of you.

41:08.450 --> 41:11.119
<i>Tell him to be Kind to his father.</i>

41:11.120 --> 41:13.830
She's saying that
your father's a good man.

41:13.831 --> 41:16.374
He's just afraid of his heart.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.502
And he needs to be taught how to love.

41:19.503 --> 41:21.629
It's so hard.

41:21.630 --> 41:24.130
I know.

41:24.174 --> 41:26.674
But it's worth it.

41:28.345 --> 41:30.845
<i>ThanKs.</i>

41:33.142 --> 41:35.184
She's saying goodbye.

41:35.185 --> 41:36.644
So soon?

41:36.645 --> 41:39.145
It's time.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.239
Goodbye, Mom.

41:55.497 --> 41:57.997
Are you okay?

41:59.167 --> 42:01.667
Yeah. You?

42:01.837 --> 42:04.506
Yeah. Yeah, really okay.

42:05.340 --> 42:08.780
No more headaches. I feel much better.

42:10.846 --> 42:13.346
One more thing left to do.

42:14.057 --> 42:17.310
I can't. I can't give it to him.

42:27.278 --> 42:31.407
Mom, I did a pretty stupid thing.
This is about Ellis.

42:31.408 --> 42:33.908
Yeah. Did he mention it?

42:34.035 --> 42:36.535
No.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.289
I apologised to him,

42:41.418 --> 42:43.794
and I'd like to apologise to you,

42:43.795 --> 42:48.632
because I've been kind of a jerk
when it comes to Ellis.

42:48.633 --> 42:50.300
