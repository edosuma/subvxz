01:52.520 --> 01:53.960
Okay little chefs,

01:54.000 --> 01:55.960
make sure your pasta machine's

01:56.000 --> 01:57.720
are on the proper setting.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.560
That's number "one" on the dial.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.160
Yack...

02:02.161 --> 02:03.720
This isn't going well.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.940
What are you talking about?

02:04.941 --> 02:06.120
It's perfect.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.480
I always say, if pasta

02:07.481 --> 02:08.800
isn't lumpy, it's not delicious.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.920
- Have I learned
- how to make pasta?

02:15.960 --> 02:17.020
You haven't got

02:17.021 --> 02:18.080
the hang of it yet.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.600
Well, I think I'll keep trying.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.320
I never give up.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.840
[chef] Very good, Mia.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.240
That's perfect.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.480
Thanks.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.880
[mocking] "Very good, Mia.

02:37.881 --> 02:39.080
That's perfect."

02:43.960 --> 02:45.900
Here. Get this into her pasta

02:45.901 --> 02:47.840
machine without her noticing.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.240
Are you kidding?!

02:49.280 --> 02:50.800
I'm not gonna do that!

02:50.840 --> 02:52.360
Am I ever "kidding"?

02:52.400 --> 02:53.640
I never joke around.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.960
Now do it, it'll be hilarious.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.120
Agh...

03:08.280 --> 03:11.760
Wow, you're really good at that.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.200
It's not rocket science.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.640
Hey!

03:24.040 --> 03:25.800
- You want something to
- wipe that off with?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.640
Thanks.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.760
[all laugh]

03:46.880 --> 03:48.020
What's happening?

03:48.021 --> 03:49.160
Is she having fun?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.440
I didn't tell her to do that!

03:51.480 --> 03:53.120
Excuse me!

03:53.160 --> 03:54.656
- I don't know how I can
- be expected to learn

03:54.680 --> 03:56.360
- When there's
- all this disruption!

04:03.960 --> 04:05.360
I always thought it would be

04:05.361 --> 04:06.760
Violetta to get me in trouble.

04:06.800 --> 04:07.960
Not you guys.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.200
Oh lighten up.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.560
You started it.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.640
Violetta thought

04:12.641 --> 04:13.680
it would be funny.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.060
Violetta probably thinks

04:15.061 --> 04:16.399
chicken pox is funny,

04:16.440 --> 04:18.160
as long as somebody else has it.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.959
Probably.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.519
But it's nice being with

04:21.521 --> 04:23.040
the popular group for a change.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.140
When I'm hanging around

04:24.141 --> 04:25.200
Violetta,

04:25.240 --> 04:28.040
people want to talk to me.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.280
- Hello?
- There are two other people here

04:30.320 --> 04:31.600
With fresh pasta

04:31.601 --> 04:32.880
in their hair talking to you.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.260
And without insulting you

04:34.261 --> 04:35.600
or making you do mean things.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
You guys aren't like

04:38.241 --> 04:39.241
I thought you were.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.320
Mhmm...

04:43.080 --> 04:44.800
Um, Vincent,

04:44.840 --> 04:47.440
I have to... step out a second.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.080
Do you think you could...

04:49.120 --> 04:51.000
Right!

04:51.001 --> 04:52.880
I'll help you... step out.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.680
We'll be right back. Promise.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.260
- You got the door?

05:03.261 --> 05:04.320
- I got the door.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.640
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.060
"Near cave and vine

05:30.061 --> 05:31.440
the treasure lies,

05:31.480 --> 05:32.500
the least of them shall

05:32.501 --> 05:33.520
get the prize."

05:47.200 --> 05:53.240
Whoooaa... Aaaaaahh!

05:54.840 --> 05:56.240
[grunts]

05:56.280 --> 05:57.640
Agh!

05:59.960 --> 06:01.200
[neighs]

06:01.240 --> 06:03.160
Hello to you too.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
I hope I don't have any

06:04.561 --> 06:05.920
flour on me...

06:05.960 --> 06:07.160
Oh, never mind.

06:07.161 --> 06:08.360
It's a long story.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.160
[someone snoring]

06:11.200 --> 06:12.360
[Onchao neighs slightly]

06:12.400 --> 06:13.640
Aah... ehh.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.120
Oh, you're here.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.640
- She's here!

06:19.641 --> 06:21.120
- You were watching for me?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.400
That's all a Pan is good for

06:22.401 --> 06:23.640
around here.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.320
I wait until an elf shows up,

06:25.360 --> 06:27.640
- and then I tell the other elves
- about it.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.160
I could tell them myself.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.360
Well that's just great.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.640
So I'm no good for anything.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.140
There goes the last thing

06:35.141 --> 06:36.600
I had to cling to.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.440
- No, I didn't mean...
- [Yuko] There you are!

06:40.840 --> 06:41.900
Just when we were ready

06:41.901 --> 06:42.960
for some excitement!

06:43.000 --> 06:44.856
- Did the Oracle say where
- to search this time?

06:44.880 --> 06:46.820
It said: "Near cave and vine

06:46.821 --> 06:48.760
the treasure lies,

06:48.800 --> 06:50.240
but the least of them

06:50.241 --> 06:51.680
shall get the prize."

06:51.720 --> 06:52.760
[Mo] Hmmm.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.440
Cave and vine...

06:54.480 --> 06:56.760
Sounds like the Lofty Caves.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.440
There's lots of vines there!

06:58.480 --> 07:00.400
- It's a good place to start.
- Let's go.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.360
[Phuddle] I'm coming with you!

07:02.400 --> 07:03.680
Listen Phuddle,

07:03.681 --> 07:04.960
don't take it personally,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.400
but you can't come with us!

07:06.401 --> 07:07.800
Okay?

07:07.840 --> 07:09.400
Yuko is right, Phuddle.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.560
The Lofty Caves are no place

07:10.561 --> 07:11.680
for a Pan.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.480
Why?! I'm just as heroic as

07:13.481 --> 07:15.240
any of you elves!

07:15.280 --> 07:16.660
Name one thing you can do

07:16.661 --> 07:18.040
that I can't!

07:18.080 --> 07:19.560
- Fly.
- Water glare.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.080
- Fight a munculus.
- Smell nice.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.480
Whoa whoa whoa!

07:22.520 --> 07:24.600
I said one thing!

07:24.640 --> 07:26.040
Mhmmm...

07:26.080 --> 07:27.340
Stay here!

07:27.341 --> 07:28.600
Do not leave without me!

07:40.120 --> 07:42.456
- Do you think maybe you guys
- are being a little hard on him?

07:42.480 --> 07:43.840
We're just being realistic.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.360
[Phuddle] BEHOLD!

07:45.400 --> 07:48.480
Ladies and gentle-elves!

07:48.520 --> 07:50.360
I, Pan Phuddle,

07:50.400 --> 07:51.820
shall hence-to-forward

07:51.821 --> 07:53.240
no longer be a Pan!

07:53.280 --> 07:56.720
I will be an Elf like you!

07:56.760 --> 07:58.720
I can move like an Elf!

07:58.760 --> 08:01.680
Fight a munculus like an elf!

08:01.720 --> 08:02.740
Throw a Water Glare

08:02.741 --> 08:03.760
like an Elf...

08:03.800 --> 08:05.560
- Whoops!
- [chuckles nervously]

08:06.680 --> 08:08.000
[snorts]

08:08.040 --> 08:10.000
And, I can fly like an Elf!

08:10.040 --> 08:11.240
Observe!

08:14.600 --> 08:17.040
Whoaa... he he...

08:17.041 --> 08:19.480
[pants] wooo... Aah...

08:19.520 --> 08:22.040
Uh oh... Aaaaaaaaaaah!

08:22.080 --> 08:23.760
[grunts]

08:23.800 --> 08:25.600
[Mia] Phuddle, are you okay?

08:25.640 --> 08:26.920
That needed just

08:26.921 --> 08:28.200
a teensy adjustment.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.460
But I can be an Elf!

08:29.461 --> 08:30.680
Right, Mia?!

08:30.720 --> 08:34.559
Well, uummm... I guess... so.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.440
Oh please, please, please.

08:36.441 --> 08:38.280
Can I? Can I? Oh Can I...?

08:42.080 --> 08:44.440
Okay! Fine! You can come!

08:44.480 --> 08:45.800
Just stop looking at me with

08:45.801 --> 08:47.120
those big Pan eyes!

08:47.160 --> 08:48.760
Yippee!

08:48.800 --> 08:50.360
I'm an elf!

08:50.400 --> 08:52.080
I didn't say that.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.800
It was implied.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.280
I'm an elf, I'm an elf!

08:57.320 --> 08:58.960
You're in charge of him.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.936
- I'll take full responsibility.
- [Phuddle gasps]

09:00.960 --> 09:03.600
Unicorn dust!

09:03.640 --> 09:04.920
It is the duty of every elf

09:04.921 --> 09:06.200
to spread unicorn dust

09:06.240 --> 09:08.160
and keep Centopia thriving!

09:08.200 --> 09:10.240
You tell him that's Itch Fungus.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.360
- [sighs]
- He'll figure it out.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.080
I'm an elf! I'm an elf!

09:16.120 --> 09:20.680
Ough... agh... oh... uuhh...

09:27.680 --> 09:29.560
[Phuddle] Whoaaa! Oh, oh,

09:29.561 --> 09:31.440
ohhhhh! Look out... yaaaa!

09:31.480 --> 09:34.320
I... I got it! Flying! Oh oh...

09:34.360 --> 09:35.900
Mia, can you do something about

09:35.901 --> 09:37.440
Phuddle? He's slowing us down.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.020
Yeah. And he's going to

09:39.021 --> 09:40.560
attract Gargona's attention!

09:40.600 --> 09:42.160
I know, I know... you're right.

09:42.161 --> 09:43.720
I'll talk to him.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.720
- [with effort]
- Uh... uh... ugh...

09:45.760 --> 09:47.240
Listen, Phuddle.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.496
- Why don't you
- give your wings a break

09:48.520 --> 09:50.040
And ride on Onchao with me?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.180
Elf warriors

09:51.181 --> 09:52.280
don't ride on unicorns.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.880
They would if they could.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.880
- Right, Mo?
- Oh, yes.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.220
No Elf would pass up

09:57.221 --> 09:58.520
a chance to ride on a unicorn.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.620
It's a once

09:59.621 --> 10:00.680
in a lifetime opportunity

10:00.720 --> 10:02.380
to feel the bond

10:02.381 --> 10:04.040
between Elf and unicorn.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.760
Ohhhhhh...

10:08.760 --> 10:11.640
Ooh... I can feel it!

10:11.680 --> 10:14.280
I can feel our bond!

10:14.320 --> 10:15.520
[snorts]

10:15.560 --> 10:16.960
[elves giggle]

10:17.000 --> 10:18.200
Let's go.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.240
[Phuddle] WHEEEEEEEEeeeeee!

10:20.280 --> 10:23.000
Lofty caves here we come!

10:27.920 --> 10:29.680
[shrieks]

10:41.600 --> 10:42.880
- [laughs excited]
- [snorts]

10:42.920 --> 10:44.240
- Woooooooooo!!
- [grunts]

10:47.400 --> 10:49.060
What did I tell ya? This place

10:49.061 --> 10:50.720
is overgrown with vines.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.300
Onchao, do you feel like there's

10:52.301 --> 10:53.840
a piece of the Trumptus here?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.600
[snorts]

10:55.640 --> 10:57.080
[Phuddle] Found it!

10:57.120 --> 10:58.960
I found the Trumptus piece!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.960
I found the Trumptus piece!

11:02.000 --> 11:03.680
Oh. Um... false alarm.

11:03.681 --> 11:05.360
It's just a rock. [chuckles]

11:06.880 --> 11:07.940
Any elf could have

11:07.941 --> 11:09.000
made that mistake!

11:09.040 --> 11:10.960
It's a very Trumptussy rock!

11:14.200 --> 11:15.420
I know...

11:15.421 --> 11:16.640
he's my responsibility.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.200
- Phuddle,
- seeing as you've got wings now,

11:23.240 --> 11:24.640
I think it's time you had

11:24.641 --> 11:26.040
your first Flying Lesson.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.760
Elves do that?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.160
Sure they do.

11:29.161 --> 11:30.520
Yuko gave me a Flying Lesson.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.080
Now I'll give one to you.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.280
Woooaaah...

11:37.320 --> 11:39.240
Uuuff!

11:39.280 --> 11:41.800
- Better stick to the basics...
- [Yuko] With a little practice,

11:41.840 --> 11:42.880
One day you might be

11:42.881 --> 11:43.920
as good as Mia.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.040
[Yuko and Mo laugh]

11:46.080 --> 11:47.200
Let's try this in private,

11:47.201 --> 11:48.320
shall we?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
The first thing to know when it

11:52.321 --> 11:53.800
comes to flying is how to glide.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.360
Like this.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.160
Now you try it.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.040
- Don't flap your wings.
- Just glide.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.680
[grunts with effort]

12:04.720 --> 12:06.600
Haaa...

12:06.640 --> 12:09.480
Hey, I did it!

12:09.520 --> 12:10.540
I mean, um...

12:10.541 --> 12:11.560
[clears throat]

12:11.600 --> 12:12.960
too easy

12:12.961 --> 12:14.320
for a valiant elf warrior.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.960
I'm like Prince Mo...

12:15.961 --> 12:17.560
with nicer hair.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.440
- [both laugh]
- When you get better

12:21.480 --> 12:23.000
You can even try twirling.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.800
I'm not very good at that yet.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.160
I am!

12:26.200 --> 12:28.360
Em... Probably!

12:28.400 --> 12:29.780
- Wheee... whoaaaa!

12:29.781 --> 12:31.160
- Phuddle!

12:31.200 --> 12:33.820
- Wheee... Heeeeeeelp!

12:33.821 --> 12:36.440
- Oh dear!

12:39.480 --> 12:40.960
[neighs]

12:43.080 --> 12:44.680
[Yuko] He found it.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.780
- The Trumptus piece.

12:45.781 --> 12:46.840
- Whoaaaaaa!! Oof!

12:51.800 --> 12:53.160
Watch where you're going!

12:53.200 --> 12:55.120
It's not my fault!

12:55.160 --> 12:56.780
There's some kind of updraft,

12:56.781 --> 12:58.400
downdraft thingy up there!

12:58.440 --> 12:59.640
[Mo] That's just great!

13:03.120 --> 13:04.540
Now look what you've done,

13:04.541 --> 13:05.960
you bumbling bonehead!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.896
- You made me drop
- the Trumptus piece into a cave!

13:07.920 --> 13:09.440
You call yourself an Elf?!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.080
Hmmm... the little unicorn

13:16.081 --> 13:18.000
with the golden horn.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.800
It's a big cave.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.400
I can't feel anything!

13:26.440 --> 13:27.680
- [neighs]

13:27.681 --> 13:28.920
- [Mia] Onchao!

13:28.960 --> 13:30.700
- Come on, we gotta get him!

13:30.701 --> 13:32.440
- I don't think so!

13:32.480 --> 13:33.520
[hissing]

13:33.560 --> 13:34.760
[grunt]

13:34.800 --> 13:37.040
You're too late to help him now!

13:37.080 --> 13:38.680
[cackles]

13:41.720 --> 13:43.400
[dragons shriek]

13:43.440 --> 13:44.480
Phuddle, hurry!

13:44.520 --> 13:46.800
Urg! Ugh!

13:46.840 --> 13:50.000
I can't get it off!

13:50.040 --> 13:51.600
Pull harder! [grunts]

13:52.640 --> 13:54.120
[grunts with effort]

13:54.160 --> 13:55.760
- Thanks, Phuddle.
- Whoa!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.340
I can't believe I did that!

13:57.341 --> 13:58.880
[chuckles]

13:58.920 --> 14:01.240
AAAAH!

14:02.520 --> 14:03.560
Let's get 'em!

14:09.120 --> 14:10.680
Get out of my way!

14:12.160 --> 14:13.680
[Yuko laughs]

14:15.080 --> 14:16.720
- [Gargona] Don't let them
- get away!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.440
RAHHRR!

14:23.080 --> 14:24.800
[nearby neigh]

14:24.840 --> 14:26.640
Let him go! I said drop him!

14:29.920 --> 14:31.440
Meddlers! Hya!

14:33.240 --> 14:34.240
Ha! Give 'em a left!

14:34.241 --> 14:35.241
And a right!

14:35.280 --> 14:37.640
Show 'em who's boss!

14:37.680 --> 14:38.840
I'm gonna show her

14:38.841 --> 14:40.000
what we elves are made of!

14:40.040 --> 14:41.600
Um... Phuddle...

14:41.640 --> 14:43.240
Flee from my mighty

14:43.241 --> 14:44.840
elven water glare!

14:44.880 --> 14:46.120
[grunts]

14:47.760 --> 14:49.040
Ppffff...

14:49.080 --> 14:50.280
I bet that happens to Mo

14:50.320 --> 14:51.560
all the time. Heh...

14:54.600 --> 14:56.240
SPLASHH!

15:00.200 --> 15:01.700
[Mo] (GRUNTS) Ugh! He...

15:01.701 --> 15:03.200
Won't... Let... Go!

15:03.240 --> 15:04.440
Mo!!

15:04.480 --> 15:06.520
[Gargona] That unicorn is mine!

15:06.560 --> 15:08.180
I'll get him! You just got

15:08.181 --> 15:09.800
to use a little ingenuity.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.120
[scratching noises]

15:13.160 --> 15:15.480
ROARR!

15:15.520 --> 15:18.000
[Mo] My, aren't you resourceful.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.080
Look out!

15:22.680 --> 15:24.560
You haven't won!

15:24.600 --> 15:27.280
I'll have that unicorn yet!

15:29.800 --> 15:32.120
[Phuddle] Hooray! We did it!

15:33.320 --> 15:35.880
I'm so glad you're safe.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.020
[snakes hissing]

15:37.021 --> 15:38.120
Oh no! Look!

15:39.160 --> 15:41.040
[Mia] Gargona's snakes!

15:42.560 --> 15:44.440
That's not gonna make it easier.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.600
It's only a few. I'll go.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.080
No. This is my fault.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.200
I'll go in.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.300
You guys lower me down

15:51.301 --> 15:52.360
into the cave.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.760
No problem!

15:53.800 --> 15:56.360
I'll handle this myself, guys!

16:02.560 --> 16:04.080
Or... You can help.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.560
That's fine too.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.720
Urgh... ugh...

16:11.760 --> 16:13.400
I can't... fit in!

16:13.440 --> 16:15.880
The opening is too small.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.360
No Elf is gonna fit in there.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.680
But... A Pan might.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.120
A Pan doesn't have wings.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.720
- And a Pan would be
- stealthy enough

16:23.760 --> 16:25.040
To take the Trumptus piece

16:25.080 --> 16:26.320
without any of those snakes

16:26.360 --> 16:27.400
even knowing he was there.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.200
Sounds great!

16:29.240 --> 16:30.800
You guys know any Pans?

16:30.840 --> 16:31.960
[all] Phuddle!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.760
But...

16:33.800 --> 16:35.680
but I don't wanna be a Pan.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.720
I like being an Elf!

16:37.760 --> 16:39.380
Fake wings and a giant wig

16:39.381 --> 16:41.000
won't turn you into an Elf.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.460
You're a Pan and I think it's

16:42.461 --> 16:43.880
time you behaved like one.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.020
I behaved like one

16:45.021 --> 16:46.120
for most of my life!

16:46.160 --> 16:48.280
I am not good at it!

16:48.320 --> 16:49.420
Plus, I just thought,

16:49.421 --> 16:50.520
if I was an Elf,

16:50.560 --> 16:52.160
you guys might like me better.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.160
Phuddle... we like you just

16:55.161 --> 16:56.400
the way you are.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.000
I mean, the way you were.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.080
You know what I mean.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.240
It's true, Phuddle.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.080
Yeah. Just be yourself.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.640
[neighs]

17:03.680 --> 17:05.160
Besides...

17:05.200 --> 17:07.079
- I think that's
- what the Oracle meant!:

17:07.119 --> 17:08.319
"the least of them

17:08.320 --> 17:09.520
shall get the prize."

17:09.560 --> 17:10.920
It's you Phuddle.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.599
You're the smallest of us!

17:12.640 --> 17:14.960
Really? You think I can do it?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.400
Sure. Who built the Trumptus?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.560
I guess I did!

17:19.599 --> 17:21.520
- And who made his own
- working elevator?

17:21.560 --> 17:23.560
I did!

17:23.599 --> 17:25.460
Also five elevators that don't

17:25.461 --> 17:27.319
work, often catastrophically.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.800
But one that does!

17:28.840 --> 17:30.280
Oh... Maybe you're right.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.200
Maybe I am better as a Pan.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.720
You sure couldn't be any worse!

17:33.760 --> 17:35.440
You got that right!

17:37.080 --> 17:38.960
[chuckles with embarrassment]

17:45.360 --> 17:46.840
[elves] Phuddle!

17:55.280 --> 17:58.360
Well... here goes nothing...

17:58.400 --> 17:59.800
You think he'll be okay?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.520
Um... yes?

18:01.560 --> 18:04.600
[Phuddle] Laa. Lala... laaaa...

18:04.640 --> 18:06.200
[hissing]

18:07.240 --> 18:08.400
Duugh...

18:08.440 --> 18:09.480
[grunts]

18:09.520 --> 18:11.200
whoaaa Aaah.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.120
Agh!

18:15.160 --> 18:16.720
Woouu...

18:22.160 --> 18:23.840
[hissing]

18:24.880 --> 18:25.920
Duugh...

18:32.760 --> 18:33.920
[hissing]

18:50.360 --> 18:51.400
[gasps]

18:52.440 --> 18:53.480
Agh!

18:55.120 --> 18:56.880
[pants with fear]

18:56.920 --> 18:58.660
Come on Phuddle!

18:58.661 --> 19:00.400
You can do this!

19:02.440 --> 19:05.120
[grunts with effort]

19:09.000 --> 19:11.240
Got it!

19:11.280 --> 19:12.320
[hissing]

19:12.360 --> 19:13.440
Uh oh...

19:13.480 --> 19:19.360
Aaaaaaggghhhh!!!

19:19.400 --> 19:20.700
Aren't Pans usually

19:20.701 --> 19:22.000
more subtle than that?

19:22.040 --> 19:24.520
Aaaaaggghhh!!!

19:24.560 --> 19:25.720
Pull me up!

19:25.760 --> 19:27.520
Pull me up!

19:29.200 --> 19:31.360
Weeeeheeeeeeeeeee!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.040
Ta da!

19:35.080 --> 19:36.720
I knew you could do it!

19:36.760 --> 19:37.920
Can I at least

19:37.921 --> 19:39.080
have my elf hair back?!

19:39.120 --> 19:40.200
Phuddle!

19:40.240 --> 19:41.600
Oouhh...

19:47.920 --> 19:49.560
[cheers and applause]

19:56.400 --> 19:58.920
I hereby award you, Pan Phuddle,

19:58.960 --> 20:00.360
with the Elves highest honour,

20:00.361 --> 20:01.760
for bravery, courage,

20:01.800 --> 20:03.760
and heroism in the course

20:03.761 --> 20:05.720
of retrieving a Trumptus piece!

20:07.400 --> 20:09.040
Congratulations.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.800
[cheering]

20:21.160 --> 20:22.400
[Yuko] Nice work, Phuddle.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.080
Centopia thanks you.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.360
And just think...

20:25.400 --> 20:26.880
you did it all by being a Pan,

20:26.920 --> 20:28.280
not an Elf.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.200
[neighs]

20:30.240 --> 20:32.200
- So, do you have
- the Trumptus piece?

20:32.240 --> 20:33.880
Yeah, I've got it right here!

20:34.880 --> 20:36.360
I put it right...

20:36.400 --> 20:38.320
I... I had it a second ago...

20:38.360 --> 20:40.080
- Oh oh!
- [Mia] Phuddle!

20:40.120 --> 20:41.360
- You didn't drop it,
- did you?

20:42.840 --> 20:45.120
Kidding!

20:45.160 --> 20:46.340
[Phuddle] Seven down,

20:46.341 --> 20:47.520
thirteen to go!

20:51.600 --> 20:53.240
- Well,
- there's more oracles to get to.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.360
I'm not gonna get them

20:54.361 --> 20:55.440
hanging around here.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.256
- I'll be watching for you!
- Somebody's gotta

20:57.280 --> 20:59.160
- Let the elves know
- when you get here.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.340
I thought you weren't

21:00.341 --> 21:01.480
going to do that anymore.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.940
Meh. Truth is,

21:02.941 --> 21:04.360
I kinda like it.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.760
It's a good excuse for a nap.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.640
- You were napping on the job
- Phuddle?

21:08.680 --> 21:09.960
Uh... What?!

21:10.000 --> 21:11.640
NO! Of course not!

21:11.680 --> 21:12.880
Hee... Who said that?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.880
That would be so irresponsible!

21:14.920 --> 21:16.760
- [laughs] Well,
- I guess I'll see you

21:16.800 --> 21:18.240
When I come back, Phuddle.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.240
Bye guys!

21:20.280 --> 21:21.760
Bye Onchao!

21:21.800 --> 21:23.200
- Bye Mia!
- Bye bye, Mia!

21:23.240 --> 21:24.760
See you soon Mia!

21:26.480 --> 21:28.080
I got me an award!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.840
I got me an award!

21:29.880 --> 21:32.000
[all laugh]

21:48.360 --> 21:49.960
Um, hi um...

21:49.961 --> 21:51.560
do you want some help with that?

21:51.600 --> 21:53.680
It's alright. I can manage.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.840
Are you okay?

22:00.880 --> 22:03.040
Sure. Fine. Fine.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.080
Where's Mia?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.320
Um...

22:07.200 --> 22:08.800
Mia... who?

22:08.840 --> 22:10.080
Oh come on, MIA!

22:12.960 --> 22:14.040
That Mia?

22:15.640 --> 22:17.560
Um... hi.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.000
[Violetta] (KNOCKING) Paula?

22:20.040 --> 22:22.000
- Are you done
- cleaning up with those dorks?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.800
[Paula] Yes, yes!

22:24.840 --> 22:26.160
I'll be with you in a minute!

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
