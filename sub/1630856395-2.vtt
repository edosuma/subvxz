WEBVTT

00:19.791 --> 00:22.125
When you find him, he's mine.

00:35.916 --> 00:36.625
If she

00:36.625 --> 00:38.000
finds out you were here

00:38.000 --> 00:39.416
and you didn't see her

00:39.416 --> 00:41.833
you will break her heart.

00:52.583 --> 00:53.750
You're going to have a

00:53.750 --> 00:55.458
different life

00:55.458 --> 00:56.333
than me.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.833
When you're filled with rage,

00:59.833 --> 01:00.916
it makes you blind.

01:02.000 --> 01:02.791
You can be used.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.750
I need just one train car.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.291
I won't bring a war here.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.625
All we need is ten.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.375
You are needed.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.041
We will defeat you.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.250
- The crowd is fickle.
- Lowak!

04:04.416 --> 04:06.250
Whichever team loses this game...

04:06.500 --> 04:08.750
...will be banished
from these lands forever.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.625
You cannot lose focus now!

08:28.833 --> 08:30.625
Ever take this off-roading?

08:31.041 --> 08:31.750
Never.

08:32.458 --> 08:35.291
Grandma would kill me.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.083
I'm not good

08:38.083 --> 08:40.375
with the steering wheel on the wrong side.

08:41.625 --> 08:42.833
Think I could bother you

08:42.833 --> 08:45.625
to get a few more things I need from town?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.250
A shopping list?

08:56.375 --> 08:57.416
It's not illegal

08:57.416 --> 08:58.375
is it?

10:23.375 --> 10:25.208
Go away.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.250
Let's take a ride.

12:34.791 --> 12:35.541
Okay...

12:36.833 --> 12:37.625
I got

12:37.625 --> 12:38.666
supper

12:38.666 --> 12:39.666
at seven.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.500
I'm not supposed to

12:42.500 --> 12:43.666
have the truck...

12:43.666 --> 12:46.083
You can have supper with Chula

12:46.333 --> 12:47.791
'til you're 60.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.000
What are we doing here?

15:29.375 --> 15:30.875
I need one more thing.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.750
Am I missing something?

15:48.333 --> 15:49.708
Your phone, please.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.083
Follow the tracker.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.750
Almost a full moon.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.083
That'll help you see.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.416
Help me see what?

16:22.875 --> 16:23.875
Me.

23:23.958 --> 23:25.208
You almost died!

23:32.916 --> 23:34.250
Whatever you stole,

23:34.666 --> 23:36.083
it better be worth it.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.875
Steal?

23:38.041 --> 23:39.375
I didn't steal anything.

26:39.125 --> 26:39.791
Now...

26:39.791 --> 26:40.958
you say...

26:41.875 --> 26:42.750
you

26:42.750 --> 26:44.083
got that...

26:44.333 --> 26:46.041
caught in something?

26:46.500 --> 26:48.791
Think you can fix it?

26:51.875 --> 26:54.416
I want something like this.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.666
Where's my...

27:07.458 --> 27:09.583
slip-joint pliers?

27:19.833 --> 27:20.708
Thank you.

27:25.416 --> 27:26.791
I really

27:27.416 --> 27:28.750
miss you

27:28.750 --> 27:29.833
around here.

27:30.708 --> 27:33.708
20 years is... way too long.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.666
It wasn't my choice.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.291
I go...

27:41.875 --> 27:43.625
get things.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.375
somebody comes in...

27:50.125 --> 27:51.375
just, uhh...

28:55.250 --> 28:56.458
Thank you.

28:56.958 --> 28:58.500
The real one

28:59.250 --> 29:02.000
take time

29:02.666 --> 29:04.791
for me to build.

29:05.583 --> 29:06.833
That's temporary.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.541
Don't you run off with it.

29:12.166 --> 29:14.541
I doubt I could run with this
if I wanted to.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.291
Ah... You know her.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.166
That's...

29:48.541 --> 29:50.041
the first Choctaw.

29:50.333 --> 29:53.333
The one who saved everyone from the cave.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.375
Oh yeah.

29:54.833 --> 29:58.333
And when they emerged,

29:58.625 --> 30:02.166
they turned into human beings.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.541
Your grandmother

30:05.083 --> 30:06.625
could trace

30:06.625 --> 30:07.958
your roots

30:08.333 --> 30:10.000
back to

30:11.375 --> 30:13.291
the first Choctaw.

30:15.791 --> 30:16.958
Chafa and

30:16.958 --> 30:18.625
the ancestors would

30:18.625 --> 30:20.416
watch out for

30:20.875 --> 30:21.791
family

30:22.333 --> 30:25.000
in times of need.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.666
They're tricky.

30:29.416 --> 30:31.083
You can never predict...

30:31.083 --> 30:33.416
...when they might come calling.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.625
Your grandmother

30:36.625 --> 30:38.583
knows all that.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.583
Maybe you

30:41.583 --> 30:42.958
ask her?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.875
Let me know when

30:46.875 --> 30:48.916
my leg is ready?

30:49.333 --> 30:50.666
Thank you.

34:07.666 --> 34:10.041
I expected you here a while ago.

34:10.791 --> 34:12.708
What the hell do you think you're doing?

34:13.958 --> 34:14.708
Breakfast.

34:14.708 --> 34:17.250
Most important meal of the day.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.291
You want some?

34:18.708 --> 34:19.916
You

34:19.916 --> 34:21.833
have no idea

34:21.833 --> 34:24.125
what you're messing with.

34:27.083 --> 34:28.958
I gave you a chance to know what's coming.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.958
I wanted you with me.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.625
Meaning, you're starting a war.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.250
There's already a war.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.875
And I don't want

34:37.875 --> 34:40.458
New York problems coming here.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.666
I have a strategy.

34:48.666 --> 34:50.250
It's playing out the way I planned.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.416
No. This is chaos.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.708
People will die.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.958
I say when it starts.

34:57.208 --> 34:58.375
I say when it stops.

34:58.541 --> 34:59.500
That's not chaos.

34:59.708 --> 35:00.916
That's power.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.333
You sound like

35:05.875 --> 35:07.541
Fisk.

35:09.666 --> 35:10.916
So, are you with me

35:10.916 --> 35:12.375
or against me?

35:13.041 --> 35:14.833
All I know, is I...

35:15.375 --> 35:16.916
...gotta figure out

35:16.916 --> 35:18.583
how to clean your mess.

35:19.833 --> 35:22.458
Just lay low.

35:33.041 --> 35:35.750
You seem to have forgotten

35:36.208 --> 35:38.083
that people close to you

35:38.291 --> 35:40.416
are the ones that get hurt.

35:41.291 --> 35:43.500
And who's that, exactly?
