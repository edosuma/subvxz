<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.321 --> 00:02.220
Hey, I'm back.

00:02.288 --> 00:03.022
Shane?

00:03.023 --> 00:04.656
When're you gonna
talk to him?

00:04.724 --> 00:06.358
You know, maybe for once,
you should just...

00:06.426 --> 00:07.493
Try not to interfere.

00:07.560 --> 00:08.594
Look at you and Amy.

00:08.661 --> 00:09.828
You guys are sorta
back together,

00:09.896 --> 00:11.062
but neither one of you

00:11.130 --> 00:12.197
are saying you're actually
back together.

00:12.265 --> 00:13.632
We're closer than
we've ever been before.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.767
So, in that respect,

00:14.834 --> 00:16.134
yes,
we're back together.

00:16.202 --> 00:18.002
I'd love to go
and show Renard

00:18.069 --> 00:20.405
what I can do with Spartan
once...

00:20.472 --> 00:22.239
Once I can actually do
something.

00:22.307 --> 00:24.842
We're you planning on
telling me you're moving out?

00:24.910 --> 00:26.944
This is not Amy
and I breaking up, Jack.

00:27.012 --> 00:28.446
I think it's time
to take it to another level.

00:36.353 --> 00:37.421

<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Amy, what're
you doing</i> <i>out here?</i>

01:11.219 --> 01:13.888
Amy: I'm trying to work with
Spartan in a quiet place.

01:13.956 --> 01:15.156
I'm not talking
about Spartan!

01:15.223 --> 01:16.624
I'm talking about Ty
moving out

01:16.692 --> 01:18.893
and you acting like everything
is all good!

01:18.961 --> 01:21.495
It's just a couple of miles
up the road, Mallory.

01:21.563 --> 01:24.030
And, besides, we both agreed
that this was the best thing.

01:24.098 --> 01:25.866
Yeah. If you love someone,
set them free.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.901
Then just sit there
and watch

01:27.969 --> 01:29.870
as he takes off
and keeps going

01:29.938 --> 01:31.572
and going and going...

01:31.639 --> 01:33.674
Mallory,
it's not like that.

01:33.741 --> 01:35.108
I mean,
we're not kids anymore.

01:35.176 --> 01:37.410
We know how we feel
and we trust each other.

01:37.478 --> 01:39.278
Hey, where're you going?

01:39.346 --> 01:41.246
Grrr!
Thank you!

01:45.251 --> 01:46.652
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>So, you heard from Miranda</i>

01:46.720 --> 01:48.921
since Shane went back
to Moose Jaw?

01:48.989 --> 01:51.724
Well, she called to say
that they arrived.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.058
Since then, nothing.

01:53.126 --> 01:54.693
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>So, what? That's it?</i>

01:54.760 --> 01:57.395
From now on, I have to keep
lying to my granddaughters

01:57.463 --> 01:58.463
to protect you?

01:58.531 --> 02:00.131
I wouldn't call it lying,
Jack.

02:00.199 --> 02:03.502
I mean, I'd call it...
Not telling the truth.

02:03.569 --> 02:05.069
Yeah. Well, you'd call
a spade a diamond

02:05.137 --> 02:06.070
if it wins you the hand.

02:06.138 --> 02:07.606
This can't go on, Tim.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.240
I'm getting sick and tired
of pussy-footing around

02:09.308 --> 02:10.975
this whole issue.

02:11.042 --> 02:12.209
Well, I'm trying,
Jack.

02:12.276 --> 02:13.343
(Phone rings)

02:15.747 --> 02:17.280
Just... here,
hang on a second.

02:17.348 --> 02:19.583
I gotta take this.

02:19.651 --> 02:21.685
<i>Oh, surprise, surprise...</i>

02:21.753 --> 02:23.554
<i>No, I'm not busy.</i>
<i>I'm...</i>

02:23.622 --> 02:25.288
<i>Well, helping Jack.</i>

02:25.356 --> 02:26.556
Okay, yeah.

02:27.491 --> 02:28.558
Bye.

02:30.528 --> 02:32.328
What was that all about?

02:32.396 --> 02:34.096
Uh...
Oh, that was the track.

02:34.164 --> 02:34.864
I gotta go.

02:34.932 --> 02:35.798
The track?

02:35.866 --> 02:36.799
It's important, Jack,

02:36.867 --> 02:38.034
I gotta do this
right now.

02:38.101 --> 02:39.035
So?

02:39.102 --> 02:40.136
So?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.537
Miranda? Shane?

02:41.604 --> 02:42.704
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.641 --> 02:46.041
I'm-I'm on it.

02:47.276 --> 02:49.277
(Truck door closes
and starts up)

02:56.619 --> 02:57.685
(Objects clatter)

03:00.956 --> 03:04.191
You're not gonna forget this,
are you?

03:08.096 --> 03:09.830
Of course not.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.300
Still fits.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.401
You need to tilt it down
a little.

03:15.469 --> 03:16.570
- How's that?
- Better.

03:16.637 --> 03:18.171
Yeah?

03:18.238 --> 03:19.305
You know,
I used to think

03:19.373 --> 03:22.108
I was gonna turn you
into a cowboy.

03:22.176 --> 03:23.342
I guess I should've figured
you were more

03:23.410 --> 03:25.211
of a motorcycle helmet
kind of guy.

03:25.279 --> 03:26.846
(Mimics Caleb)
Yes, I am.

03:26.914 --> 03:28.715
Both:
(Laugh)

03:28.783 --> 03:30.382
Hey, if I'm moving
into Caleb's trailer,

03:30.450 --> 03:31.717
I gotta talk the talk,
right?

03:31.785 --> 03:33.285
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

03:33.352 --> 03:35.387
Just practicing.

03:35.455 --> 03:37.389
Hey, can you gimme a hand
with this stuff?

03:37.457 --> 03:39.858
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

03:42.862 --> 03:44.630
Ty:
All right...

03:44.698 --> 03:46.931
Ty: You got it?
Amy: Yeah.

03:54.406 --> 03:55.807
(Engine rumbles)

04:00.946 --> 04:02.579
So...

04:02.647 --> 04:03.914
You never call,
you never write,

04:03.982 --> 04:05.616
and suddenly, you're here?

04:05.683 --> 04:06.717
Good ol' Tim.

04:06.784 --> 04:09.385
No kiss, no hug,
not even a hello.

04:09.453 --> 04:10.420
It's good to see you.

04:10.488 --> 04:11.955
Good to see you too.

04:12.023 --> 04:14.691
But I gotta ask you,
what happened to California?

04:14.759 --> 04:17.494
Well,
California was great--

04:17.560 --> 04:20.262
plenty of work,
tons of money--

04:20.329 --> 04:22.732
but after leaving here,

04:22.799 --> 04:24.100
I just couldn't help feeling

04:24.167 --> 04:26.636
like there was something
missing from my life.

04:26.703 --> 04:28.604
Yeah,
I know the feeling.

04:28.672 --> 04:31.073
And then,
I met Cisco here.

04:32.009 --> 04:32.942
He's a two-year-old,

04:33.010 --> 04:35.710
16 hands
and still growing.

04:38.514 --> 04:39.748
So what, you...

04:39.815 --> 04:40.949
You drove
all the way up here

04:41.017 --> 04:42.083
to show me a horse
you bought?

04:42.151 --> 04:43.484
Oh, I didn't buy the horse,
Tim.

04:43.552 --> 04:44.886
You did.

04:44.954 --> 04:46.420
At least, that's what it says
on the bill of sale.

04:46.488 --> 04:47.588
No, wait a second.

04:47.657 --> 04:48.957
You're giving me
a racehorse?!

04:49.025 --> 04:50.624
Wow, Tim.
The way you picked up on that?

04:50.692 --> 04:51.659
(Inhales tightly)

04:51.726 --> 04:52.993
If he's half as fast as you,

04:53.061 --> 04:55.996
we're gonna have a real winner
on our hands.

04:56.064 --> 04:58.198
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Well, I guess</i>
<i>this about does it.</i>

04:58.266 --> 04:59.667
Yeah.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.401
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you

05:01.469 --> 05:03.771
and help you settle in?

05:03.838 --> 05:06.605
Thanks, but I don't have
that much stuff, Amy.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.941
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal about this, okay?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.242
Yeah. No, I know,
you're right.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.343
Just a change of scenery.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.279
Yeah.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.048
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.248
Yeah. Bye.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.052
(Hats clunk,
Amy chuckles)

05:19.119 --> 05:20.186
My bad.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.658
You know, maybe I should
just hang onto this,

05:26.726 --> 05:29.094
give you something
to come back for.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.096
I already have plenty
to come back for.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.034
Thanks, Mallory.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.037
Okay. Go on.

05:40.105 --> 05:41.172
See ya.

05:44.242 --> 05:46.711
(Engine sputters
and rumbles)

05:51.249 --> 05:52.616
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

05:52.684 --> 05:55.018
You should've kept
the hat.

05:55.086 --> 05:58.621
At least then
you'd have a souvenir.

05:58.689 --> 06:00.023

See? Looks like a champion.

06:51.472 --> 06:54.674
He's got spirit,
intelligence,

06:54.741 --> 06:56.609
and wait until
you see him run.

06:58.178 --> 07:01.180
Tim:
Yeah, he looks good.

07:01.247 --> 07:02.281
He looks real good.

07:02.348 --> 07:04.116
I just can't help
but wonder...

07:04.184 --> 07:07.286
What I did to deserve
such an extravagant gift?

07:07.353 --> 07:10.255
Well, he's not exactly
a gift, Tim.

07:10.323 --> 07:11.856
More like a business deal.

07:11.924 --> 07:13.925
I'm a jockey;
I can't legally own a horse.

07:13.993 --> 07:15.159
I need a partner.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.627
So why me?

07:16.695 --> 07:18.196
Well, maybe off the track,

07:18.263 --> 07:20.798
our relationship didn't
turn out so great.

07:20.865 --> 07:22.600
But on the track?

07:22.667 --> 07:24.203
We made a hell
of a team.

07:24.267 --> 07:25.703
Who better to
hook up with?

07:25.770 --> 07:27.805
Well, I mean,
he looks promising.

07:27.872 --> 07:29.240
There's no doubt
about that.

07:29.308 --> 07:31.374
You know me,
I can't pass up a good deal.

07:31.442 --> 07:32.942
So that means?

07:33.010 --> 07:34.077
That means nothing.
Not yet.

07:34.145 --> 07:35.912
Not until Scott
looks at him.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.214
You'd be a fool
to agree to anything

07:37.281 --> 07:38.548
without getting him vetted.

07:38.616 --> 07:40.250
Yeah, and a lawyer--
to look at the paperwork,

07:40.318 --> 07:42.051
make sure
everything's legal.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.786
Hey, yeah, sure.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.989
It's all gotta be
above board.

07:47.056 --> 07:50.058
And Amy,
I want her involved.

07:50.127 --> 07:52.794
<i>She really came through for me</i>
<i>with Dexter.</i>

07:52.862 --> 07:53.895
Right. You mean,

07:53.963 --> 07:55.731
when she turned him
into a jumper?

07:57.300 --> 07:58.567
Not a good start.

07:58.635 --> 08:00.037
(Snorted chuckle)

08:00.135 --> 08:02.637
Sure. Amy. Of course.

08:03.905 --> 08:05.406
Hey, Lou.

08:05.474 --> 08:08.276
Yeah, and how's
my favourite niece?

08:09.178 --> 08:10.978
Okay, okay...

08:11.046 --> 08:12.547
Yup.

08:12.615 --> 08:14.549
Mm-hm.
And the in-laws?

08:15.518 --> 08:18.285
Oh, okay.
No, I understand. I do.

08:18.353 --> 08:19.219
You know what?

08:19.287 --> 08:21.121
I'm gonna call you back
after dinner though.

08:21.189 --> 08:22.256
Okay.

08:22.323 --> 08:23.923
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bye.

08:23.991 --> 08:25.292
Geez,
she's in a good mood.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.027
Mmm...

08:27.094 --> 08:28.594
Expecting someone?

08:28.662 --> 08:30.363
For example, Ty?

08:31.298 --> 08:32.232
Uh...

08:32.399 --> 08:34.799
No. It's just got distracted
talking to Lou.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.837
(Door closes)

08:37.905 --> 08:39.238
Tim:
Hello!

08:39.306 --> 08:41.573
Amy: Hey.
Tim: Mmm, beef stew...

08:41.642 --> 08:44.442
Huh, somebody must've been
reading my mind.

08:44.510 --> 08:45.544
Anybody sitting here?

08:45.611 --> 08:49.014
So, Tim,
what brings you by?

08:49.082 --> 08:50.749
You know,
other than dinner?

08:50.817 --> 08:53.185
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Well, I have a
favour</i> <i>to ask... you.</i>

08:53.252 --> 08:55.220
- Uh-huh.
- It's about a horse.

08:55.288 --> 08:56.655
- Okay.
- I'd like you to look at him.

08:56.723 --> 08:58.824
He's a two-year-old,
hasn't run his first race yet.

08:58.892 --> 09:02.093
Race? What, you're talking
about a racehorse?

09:02.161 --> 09:03.961
Yeah, not just any racehorse,
Jack.

09:04.029 --> 09:05.396
We're talking about a horse
that's gonna put me back

09:05.463 --> 09:06.798
in the winners' circle.

09:06.865 --> 09:09.100
Yeah.

09:09.168 --> 09:10.568

<i>Amy:</i> <i>Yeah, I kinda
missed you</i> <i>at dinner.</i>

09:28.519 --> 09:31.054

lights on in the barn.

Yeah. It's gonna take
a while to get used to.

09:33.857 --> 09:35.524
Yeah, it must be weird.

09:35.592 --> 09:36.926
Be so quiet,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.728
after living four years
above a horse barn.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.662
(Animal chatters)

09:40.731 --> 09:42.898
Actually,
it's kinda noisy.

09:42.966 --> 09:44.033
(Laughs)

09:45.301 --> 09:46.301
(Animal chatters loudly)

09:46.369 --> 09:47.703
Hey, Amy?

09:47.770 --> 09:49.838
Um, I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

09:49.905 --> 09:51.272
Oh. Okay.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.141
Bye.
(Phone beeps off)

(Chattering)

10:13.061 --> 10:15.763
Whoa!

10:15.830 --> 10:17.497
(Hatch clunks shut)

10:19.634 --> 10:23.136
Hey, Caleb,
what's up with the raccoon?

10:23.203 --> 10:26.005
Raccoons?
A whole family of them?

10:27.574 --> 10:29.041
Yeah, they're back, man!

10:29.509 --> 10:32.344
You didn't tell me
they were here in the first place!

10:32.412 --> 10:33.479
That's exactly
what I'm looking for--

10:33.546 --> 10:35.614
a way to get rid of 'em.

10:37.049 --> 10:39.617
On the hook by the bed...
Okay.

10:39.685 --> 10:41.086
Yeah, I got 'em.

10:42.655 --> 10:44.122
Okay.
Thanks, man.

10:48.460 --> 10:50.361
This is your solution?

10:51.463 --> 10:53.864
No, it's great, man.
Thanks.

10:53.932 --> 10:54.999
No, thanks.

10:57.235 --> 10:58.302
(Exhales, annoyed)

11:02.373 --> 11:03.774
Scott:
Bingo!

11:03.842 --> 11:06.310
No problem getting in
through here.

11:06.377 --> 11:08.912
Ty: Might as well
hang a welcome sign.

11:08.979 --> 11:10.646
Well, we'll set the traps up
along here.

11:10.714 --> 11:11.915
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

11:11.982 --> 11:14.050
So, just like this.

11:14.985 --> 11:19.454
And this stuff here
is an oral rabies vaccine.

11:19.656 --> 11:21.657
It's like killing
two birds with one stone.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.759
You know,
without the killing part.

11:24.861 --> 11:26.228
Hey, thanks for doing this,
man.

11:26.296 --> 11:27.229
Caleb said
I should shoot 'em,

11:27.297 --> 11:28.530
but I couldn't do that.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.033
Well,
look on the bright side.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.835
If a gun's
your first option,

11:32.902 --> 11:35.204
maybe you're not cut out
to be a vet.

11:35.271 --> 11:37.605
So, let me ask you.
Um...

11:37.673 --> 11:39.007
What was it?

11:39.075 --> 11:40.741
The idea of actually
having to pay rent?

11:40.809 --> 11:43.945
Or just getting out
while the getting was good?

11:44.012 --> 11:45.546
What're you talking about?

11:45.613 --> 11:49.683
Well, sometimes, you stay
in one place too long and...

11:49.751 --> 11:50.985
Well, what I'm trying
to say is,

11:51.053 --> 11:52.153
you don't want
your girlfriend

11:52.221 --> 11:56.089
to think of you
as the charity case in the loft.

11:56.157 --> 11:57.924
Or the hired hand?

11:57.992 --> 11:59.525
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.994
To be honest,

12:01.062 --> 12:02.329
it was just starting to feel
too comfortable, you know?

12:02.396 --> 12:04.497
Well, no worries about that
happening in this place,

12:04.565 --> 12:06.466
that's for sure.

12:07.869 --> 12:08.835
Thanks.

12:08.903 --> 12:09.970
Have fun.

12:12.973 --> 12:14.340
Janice:
By the way,

12:14.407 --> 12:17.209
did you ever get things
sorted out with your son?

12:17.277 --> 12:19.011
Tim:
Yes... sorta.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.147
Just keep it under your hat,
will you, Janice?

12:22.215 --> 12:24.549
You still haven't told
your girls?

12:24.617 --> 12:26.118
I haven't told anyone,

12:26.186 --> 12:28.619
except for you
and Jack.

12:28.687 --> 12:32.423
You know, Shane was here,
a couple weeks ago, visiting.

12:32.491 --> 12:34.425
He and his mom moved
to Moose Jaw.

12:34.493 --> 12:36.261
You kidding me?
Moose Jaw?

12:36.328 --> 12:37.795
She left me a phone number
and an address,

12:37.863 --> 12:39.297
but...

12:39.365 --> 12:40.631
It's not gonna do me
a lotta good.

12:40.699 --> 12:43.401
'Cause she won't take
my calls anyway.

12:43.468 --> 12:45.102
Jack thinks
I should go after her.

12:45.169 --> 12:47.271
Tim... okay,
it's none of my business,

12:47.338 --> 12:49.706
but whatever arrangements
you have with this woman,

12:49.774 --> 12:51.841
- I mean--
- Miranda?

12:51.910 --> 12:53.343
Yeah, Miranda.

12:54.279 --> 12:55.445
Look,
whatever you choose to do,

12:55.513 --> 12:58.648
it's your decision,
not Jack's.

12:58.716 --> 12:59.849
I know you got a big heart,
Tim,

12:59.917 --> 13:01.951
but dragging your kid off
to Moose Jaw to get away from you?

13:02.019 --> 13:04.220
I'd say that's a pretty definite sign
to let this whole thing go.

13:04.288 --> 13:06.322
Well, that's...

13:06.390 --> 13:08.557
Sort of along the lines
I was thinking.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.993
Janice: You go chasing after somebody
who doesn't wanna be caught,

13:11.061 --> 13:12.795
it's only gonna lead you
to a world of pain.

13:15.532 --> 13:17.399
<i>(Horse whinnies nearby)</i>

13:18.434 --> 13:19.500
(Gentle command)

13:21.470 --> 13:23.371
(Gentle command)
Good boy.

13:24.873 --> 13:26.741
(Gentle command)

13:28.244 --> 13:31.313
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Surprised to see
you</i> <i>in the round pen.</i>

13:32.380 --> 13:33.847
Yeah.

13:33.915 --> 13:38.485
You know, I was doing great with him,
and then he decided to take off on me

13:38.553 --> 13:39.719
and I had to run after him.

13:39.787 --> 13:41.121
(Pen latch clanks)

13:41.189 --> 13:43.590
So you decided to take it back
a couple of steps?

13:43.658 --> 13:45.625
I guess
I just lost my focus.

13:45.693 --> 13:47.727
Well, I guess you got a lot
on your mind these days,

13:47.795 --> 13:49.329
what with Ty.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.763
You know, I...

13:50.831 --> 13:52.999
I didn't think it was
gonna feel like this.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.600
I didn't think
I was gonna hurt this much.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.035
Well, Ty's a young man.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.504
He's gotta find a place
for himself in this world.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.073
And whatever
he's looking for,

14:00.140 --> 14:02.208
I can guarantee
it's not an excuse

14:02.276 --> 14:03.509
to get away from you.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.244
(Reflective sigh)

14:09.983 --> 14:11.850
(Hoofbeats)

14:15.888 --> 14:17.856
Janice: You see that?
Told you he had speed!

14:17.923 --> 14:19.958
Yeah. He's blowing
pretty hard though.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.892
You think you're
pushing him a bit?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.327
Janice: Pushing's what you gotta
do to get a young horse in shape.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.496
Besides, it was only
an eighth of a mile.

14:25.563 --> 14:27.831
I don't know.
A racehorse?

14:27.899 --> 14:29.066
It's a lot of work.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.002
You know, I'll have
to think about this.

14:31.069 --> 14:32.003
Come on.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.170
Take him.

14:33.238 --> 14:35.206
Tim, I know
what I'm doing,

14:35.273 --> 14:36.539
and you know he can run.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.074
So how much thinking
is this gonna take?

14:38.142 --> 14:39.542
Tim:
We still gotta get him vetted.

14:40.644 --> 14:43.513
But if there's no problem
there...

14:44.448 --> 14:46.082
Okay, I'm in.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.784
You wanna seal the deal
with a handshake?

14:48.852 --> 14:50.086
Yeah,
it's a business deal,

14:50.154 --> 14:51.988
that's how people
normally...

14:52.055 --> 14:53.489
Well, I don't know
'bout normal people,

14:53.556 --> 14:54.823
but it isn't at all

14:54.891 --> 14:58.227
how I thought
we'd be doing this.

15:04.847 --> 15:07.349
Scott: <i>Well, he's got strong bones.</i>
<i>Still got some growing to do.</i>

15:07.416 --> 15:09.484
So far, so good.

15:09.552 --> 15:10.852
What'd I tell you?

15:10.919 --> 15:12.019
But you're gonna have
to keep an eye out

15:12.087 --> 15:13.621
for that swelling
around his joints.

15:13.688 --> 15:15.122
You don't worry about that,
Scott.

15:15.189 --> 15:16.490
Janice has been
taking him slow,

15:16.558 --> 15:18.325
working him gradually.

15:18.393 --> 15:19.493
Yeah, I'm gonna ice
Cisco's joints

15:19.561 --> 15:20.927
after every workout.

15:20.995 --> 15:22.496
Poultice and wrap 'em
and dose him with bute.

15:22.564 --> 15:24.097
Keep him comfortable
and ready to run.

15:24.165 --> 15:26.600
<i>Scott:</i> <i>His schedule
sounds</i> <i>a little heavy.</i>

15:26.668 --> 15:28.068
If he was my horse, I...

15:28.136 --> 15:29.602
I'm not sure that'd be
the way I'd go.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.036
Yeah, well,
we're on a strict budget,

15:31.104 --> 15:33.406
so we can't wait forever
to get him on the track.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.074
I'm just saying,

15:35.142 --> 15:37.277
put too much mileage
on a young horse,

15:37.344 --> 15:38.611
you're gonna pay for it
in the end.

15:38.679 --> 15:40.480
Tim:
Well, Amy's a part of this deal.

15:40.547 --> 15:41.781
She's working closely
with Janice.

15:41.848 --> 15:43.015
And you know Amy,

15:43.083 --> 15:44.150
she'll always
put the animal first,

15:44.217 --> 15:45.251
no matter what.

15:45.318 --> 15:46.718
Yeah. No worries
about Cisco here,

15:46.786 --> 15:48.052
with Amy onboard.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.921
So all we need from you
is a straight answer.

15:49.989 --> 15:53.358
Is the horse sound
or isn't he?

15:53.426 --> 15:54.493
Yeah. He's fine.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.062
Just don't work him
too hard, okay?

15:59.365 --> 16:00.432
Thanks, Scott.

16:03.669 --> 16:05.202
<i>Amy:</i> <i>That's what I'm
talking about,</i> <i>Ty.</i>

16:05.270 --> 16:06.504
<i>Look at Zenyatta.</i>

16:06.571 --> 16:07.971
They waited until
she was in her third year

16:08.039 --> 16:09.239
before they raced her,

16:09.308 --> 16:10.741
and then she won everything
she ever ran in

16:10.809 --> 16:12.209
except for the last one.

16:12.277 --> 16:14.077
Exactly what Scott was trying
to tell your dad.

16:14.145 --> 16:16.046
He thinks by doing training
as fast as possible

16:16.114 --> 16:18.214
you save money, but you end up
spending it on therapy

16:18.282 --> 16:19.716
and medication in the end.

16:19.784 --> 16:20.950
Yeah, but a two-year-old horse
shouldn't need to be drugged

16:21.018 --> 16:22.251
and wrapped.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.586
Too bad Janice doesn't think
like that.

16:23.654 --> 16:25.154
Janice?

16:25.222 --> 16:26.323
Tim's Janice?

16:26.390 --> 16:28.391
Yeah. The horse that
dad's looking at,

16:28.459 --> 16:30.059
Janice brought up
from California,

16:30.127 --> 16:32.529
and he wants me
to work with him.

16:32.596 --> 16:33.962
Jack:
Because he's concerned

16:34.030 --> 16:36.532
she's putting too much pressure
on the horse?

16:36.599 --> 16:38.734
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

16:38.802 --> 16:40.736
Tim seems pretty adamant
about moving things along

16:40.804 --> 16:42.137
as fast as possible.

16:42.205 --> 16:43.672
So I guess that means
you'll get caught

16:43.740 --> 16:45.474
right in the middle
of all this?

16:45.542 --> 16:47.976
Well, I haven't even
seen the horse yet,

16:48.044 --> 16:49.377
but...

16:49.445 --> 16:51.045
Yeah, I guess that's
what it's like.

16:51.112 --> 16:53.047
And there's one more thing,
Jack.

16:53.114 --> 16:54.549
Judging from appearances,

16:54.616 --> 16:56.351
it kinda seems like
they're...

16:56.418 --> 16:57.485
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

16:57.553 --> 16:59.086
Amy's dad and Janice--

16:59.154 --> 17:01.823
it's more than
about a horse.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.190
Well, it kinda seemed
that way, yeah.

17:03.258 --> 17:04.759
Mm.

17:04.827 --> 17:07.227
I can't help thinking that

17:07.294 --> 17:09.463
that woman does not
bring out the best

17:09.530 --> 17:10.597
in your father.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.801
Tim: I say tomorrow we
run him four furlongs,

17:15.869 --> 17:17.237
so he doesn't get
all tied up.

17:18.673 --> 17:20.073
You know, the one thing
about working at the track

17:20.140 --> 17:24.242
is you just always end up
taking work home with you.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.344
What do you mean,
taking work home?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.613
Are you talking
about me?

17:27.681 --> 17:29.482
Oh, is that the way
you see this?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.716
I spent four months, Tim,

17:30.784 --> 17:32.752
going through a whole range
of emotions,

17:32.819 --> 17:35.220
from denial to rage

17:35.288 --> 17:36.722
to acceptance.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.690
Now, being here with you,
I just...

17:38.758 --> 17:41.559
Realize it was all just
a huge waste of energy.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.161
Well, let's not forget
who walked out on who.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.998
(Scoffs) I haven't
forgotten for a second.

17:47.065 --> 17:48.900
But my biggest mistake
was not realizing

17:48.967 --> 17:50.368
that all I had to do
was turn around

17:50.436 --> 17:52.871
and come back up here.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.039
And I'd know
what I shoulda known all along.

17:57.675 --> 18:00.511
- So... are you inviting me in?
- Yeah.

18:00.578 --> 18:02.579
What the hell do you think
I was just doing?

18:02.647 --> 18:03.747
Tim: (Chortles) Okay, okay.

18:03.815 --> 18:04.581
Now take it easy,
take it easy.

18:04.649 --> 18:06.016
It's been awhile.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.084
Tell me about it.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.086
Tim:
Whoa!

18:14.958 --> 18:17.293
You know, I've had my fair share
of dinners at Heartland

18:17.360 --> 18:19.128
and, uh...

18:19.195 --> 18:20.797
I was thinking
that maybe next time

18:20.864 --> 18:23.198
I could make you dinner.

18:23.266 --> 18:24.667
At my place.

18:24.735 --> 18:26.601
Are you like asking me
on a date?

18:26.669 --> 18:28.670
Yeah, I guess I am.

18:28.738 --> 18:30.806
Dinner and dancing.
Whatever.

18:30.873 --> 18:32.106
Dancing?

18:32.174 --> 18:33.341
Well, I got a radio

18:33.409 --> 18:35.243
and about a square foot
of floor space.

18:35.311 --> 18:37.178
Both:
(Laugh)

18:37.246 --> 18:39.548
What do you say?
Six, seven o'clock?

18:39.615 --> 18:40.549
I'll be there.

18:40.616 --> 18:42.349
No you won't.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.051
I'm gonna pick you up;
That way it's a date.

18:44.118 --> 18:45.886
Not just you dropping by.

18:45.954 --> 18:47.054
- 'Kay?
- Okay.

18:47.121 --> 18:48.689
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:48.757 --> 18:51.459
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Okay, he opened</i>
<i>the car door...</i>

18:51.526 --> 18:52.693
He's getting in...

18:53.628 --> 18:56.129
No,
he's turning around.

18:57.065 --> 18:58.397
And there's the kiss.

18:58.466 --> 19:01.067
All right, Mallory,
enough with the play-by-play.

19:01.134 --> 19:02.669
I just thought
you may be concerned

19:02.736 --> 19:04.671
about your granddaughter's
social life.

19:04.738 --> 19:06.372
Well, I'm not.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.776
But what I am concerned
about is how,

19:09.844 --> 19:11.110
with Ty moving out,

19:11.178 --> 19:13.212
I need to find someone

19:13.280 --> 19:15.848
to help take care of this place
for the next couple of days.

19:15.915 --> 19:17.783
Are you going somewhere,
Jack?

19:17.851 --> 19:19.384
Like I said,

19:19.452 --> 19:24.089
I need someone
to give Amy a hand.

19:24.156 --> 19:28.059
Well, my job is to make sure the
dude ranch is good while Lou's gone.

19:28.127 --> 19:31.095
So, I'm afraid
the answer's no.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.798
No it isn't.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.834
The answer is
"Yes, Jack,

19:36.902 --> 19:41.138
and thank you
for the extra responsibility."

19:43.542 --> 19:47.010
(Soft creaking,
raccoons chatter loudly)

19:48.980 --> 19:50.446
Ty:
(Annoyed groan)

19:51.382 --> 19:52.582
(Sighs)

19:52.650 --> 19:55.485
Quiet!!
(Raccoons squeal and chatter)

19:55.553 --> 19:56.620
Ungh!

19:58.523 --> 19:59.923
That's it, guys!

20:01.525 --> 20:02.691
I've been patient...

20:02.759 --> 20:04.860
I've been patient
with you guys, okay?

20:04.928 --> 20:06.328
Not anymore.

20:06.396 --> 20:07.596
Not anymore!

20:07.664 --> 20:10.633
You hear that?
How 'bout that? Huh?

20:12.669 --> 20:15.103
(Trailer door slams shut)

20:15.171 --> 20:16.338
Okay...
(Cocks gun)

20:16.406 --> 20:17.472
I warned ya.

20:22.077 --> 20:25.179
(Gunshot blasts echoes
through the night)

20:25.247 --> 20:26.380
Yeah!

20:26.749 --> 20:29.216
That got your attention,
didn't it?

20:29.284 --> 20:30.351
Ah ha ha!

20:32.421 --> 20:33.487
All right.

20:34.422 --> 20:35.488
Okay.

20:35.557 --> 20:37.558
(Exaggerated relaxed sigh)

20:37.625 --> 20:39.026
(Calming breaths)

20:42.697 --> 20:44.698
(Raccoons start squealing
and chattering)

20:45.633 --> 20:49.269
Okay, guys,
that was my last warning shot!

20:49.336 --> 20:50.603
The next one's for real!

20:50.671 --> 20:53.272
So please, get in the cages
and shut up!

20:54.541 --> 20:55.608
(Infuriated howl)

20:56.543 --> 20:57.610
(Muffled growl)

20:58.545 --> 20:59.612
(Horn blasts)

21:00.614 --> 21:02.347
Tim:
(Dazed grumble)

21:03.483 --> 21:04.917
What?

21:04.985 --> 21:06.885
What is so important
you gotta call me at 6 A.M.?

21:06.953 --> 21:09.387
Well, it's been so long
since I've seen ya.

21:09.455 --> 21:10.689
I'm heading for coffee,

21:10.756 --> 21:11.556
I figured you might like
to join me?

21:11.624 --> 21:12.958
Coffee?
I got Jan...

21:13.025 --> 21:14.092
Come on.

21:15.027 --> 21:17.729
Oh. Okay.
You're buying.

21:17.797 --> 21:19.598
Don't I always?

21:23.134 --> 21:24.401
(Groans)

21:24.469 --> 21:26.470
I'm having breakfast.

21:26.537 --> 21:27.605
Full package deal.

21:34.579 --> 21:36.981
<i>Amy:</i> <i>I'm sure Peter's
mom</i> <i>means well, Lou.</i>

21:37.048 --> 21:39.983
<i>Well, she's a grandmother;</i>
<i>Comes with the territory.</i>

21:40.050 --> 21:41.618
Yeah.
Yeah, I gotta go.

21:41.685 --> 21:43.586
Okay. Yup. Bye.

21:44.755 --> 21:46.388
Hey.

21:46.456 --> 21:47.556
Hey.

21:47.625 --> 21:48.491
If you're looking
for your dad,

21:48.558 --> 21:50.059
he took off awhile ago.

21:50.127 --> 21:51.527
Well, actually,
he asked me to come out

21:51.595 --> 21:53.262
and have a look at Cisco.

21:53.330 --> 21:55.130
I just thought maybe
we could work out his schedule

21:55.197 --> 21:56.632
and his diet.

21:56.699 --> 21:58.600
Well, yesterday,
I galloped him for a mile,

21:58.668 --> 21:59.868
then opened him up
for an eighth.

21:59.936 --> 22:01.136
Did the same thing today.

22:01.203 --> 22:03.872
I plan on doing
the same thing tomorrow.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.140
You know, maybe, uh...

22:05.207 --> 22:06.574
Maybe should ease back
a little,

22:06.643 --> 22:08.309
take every second,
third day off,

22:08.377 --> 22:09.544
and put him out in a paddock.

22:09.612 --> 22:10.678
You don't put racehorses
in paddocks,

22:10.746 --> 22:11.612
especially not
with other horses.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.114
They could get hurt.

22:13.181 --> 22:15.082
He already is hurt
or you wouldn't be icing him.

22:16.584 --> 22:17.952
(Clears throat)
You know what, Amy?

22:18.020 --> 22:19.386
I really appreciate
your input.

22:19.454 --> 22:20.788
But I've worked
with dozens of racehorses,

22:20.856 --> 22:23.691
so I think I know
a little more about it than you do.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.626
I'm just trying to help,
Janice.

22:27.261 --> 22:29.195
Fine. You wanna do
some massage

22:29.263 --> 22:30.730
or whispering

22:30.798 --> 22:32.231
or give him his vitamins
and minerals or whatever,

22:32.299 --> 22:33.700
be my guest.

22:43.276 --> 22:44.710
(Truck rumbles)

22:50.383 --> 22:51.449
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

22:53.553 --> 22:55.253
Hey! What happened
to the coffee?

22:55.321 --> 22:56.288
Nothing.

22:56.355 --> 22:58.790
Except it's in Moose Jaw.

22:59.725 --> 23:00.925
Okay.

23:00.993 --> 23:02.160
All right.

23:02.227 --> 23:03.327
Pull the truck over, Jack.
Let me out.

23:03.395 --> 23:04.461
Hey, you want out,

23:04.529 --> 23:05.830
you're gonna have
to jump.

23:05.898 --> 23:07.098
- Oh, I will.
- Go ahead then, tuck and roll.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.299
Trust me, I will.

23:08.366 --> 23:09.901
And you'll be responsible
for my death.

23:09.968 --> 23:11.202
Promises, promises.

23:12.137 --> 23:13.437
Let me outta the truck,
Jack!

23:13.505 --> 23:16.606
Just think of it
as a friendly intervention...

23:16.674 --> 23:18.809
And an opportunity for you
to settle this Shane thing

23:18.876 --> 23:20.343
once and for all.

23:24.315 --> 23:25.381
All right.

23:26.984 --> 23:28.919
Moose Jaw it is.

23:28.986 --> 23:30.552
<i>Actually, your timing</i>
<i>couldn't be better</i>

23:30.620 --> 23:34.256
'cause I didn't get much sleep
last night.

23:34.324 --> 23:36.125
There's nothing like a long,
boring drive

23:36.193 --> 23:37.292
to make up for it.

23:38.795 --> 23:40.529
(Exhales)
Kinda like the old rodeo days,

23:40.597 --> 23:41.663
huh, Jack?

23:41.732 --> 23:42.898
(Laughs)

23:42.966 --> 23:45.167
Me driving,
you sleeping one off?

23:45.235 --> 23:47.368
Well, you just remember
it was your idea.

23:47.436 --> 23:49.104
So don't expect me
to pay for gas.

23:49.171 --> 23:51.973
Ha ha!
Exactly like the old days.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.837
<i>They kept me up</i>
<i>all night!</i>

23:57.840 --> 23:59.007
And I checked the traps.

23:59.075 --> 24:00.375
Nothing--

24:00.443 --> 24:02.977
No footprints or scat
anywhere near them.

24:03.045 --> 24:03.978
Scott: There might be
too many other options,

24:04.046 --> 24:05.512
in terms of food.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.581
I mean, they didn't choose
the place for the view.

24:07.649 --> 24:09.116
(Diner door closes)

24:09.384 --> 24:11.052
Ty: Hey.
Amy: Hey.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.253
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Aren't you supposed
to be</i> <i>at the track?</i>

24:12.320 --> 24:13.487
Yeah.

24:13.555 --> 24:14.756
Aren't you working
with Janice?

24:14.823 --> 24:17.024
I thought I was,
but Janice didn't.

24:17.092 --> 24:18.258
I mean, she treated me

24:18.326 --> 24:19.860
like I was some horse crazy
little girl!

24:19.928 --> 24:21.195
Well, she wasn't exactly
interested

24:21.262 --> 24:22.996
in my professional opinion
either.

24:23.064 --> 24:24.497
Yeah, your dad knows
a lot about horses,

24:24.565 --> 24:25.899
but he went along with her.

24:25.967 --> 24:27.567
Yeah, it's 'cause as far
as he's concerned,

24:27.635 --> 24:29.136
they're not doing anything
wrong.

24:29.204 --> 24:30.403
They're not breaking
the law,

24:30.471 --> 24:31.605
they're not doing
something

24:31.672 --> 24:32.772
that everyone else
isn't doing.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.374
It's just the way
racehorses are trained.

24:35.442 --> 24:38.745
And... (Sighs)
I don't know.

24:38.813 --> 24:41.214
Maybe I'm making a big deal
about nothing.

24:41.281 --> 24:42.448
Maybe I should
just forget about it.

24:45.086 --> 24:46.753
Well, that sounds like
a good idea, Amy.

24:46.821 --> 24:47.987
You just leave it alone.

24:48.055 --> 24:49.588
Probably best
for everybody concerned.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.023
Oh, very funny, guys.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.324
Scott and Ty:
(Laughing)

24:52.392 --> 24:54.493
Ty, my dad hired me
to do a job, okay?

24:54.561 --> 24:58.463
I can't just sit here
and watch this happen.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.066
I'm gonna go deal with it.
I'll see you tonight.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.200
Okay.

25:02.135 --> 25:03.202
(Diner door opens)

25:05.538 --> 25:07.272
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Okay, so just remember now,</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:09.708
she's been a single mother
for a long time now.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.910
So you don't wanna
dredge up the past

25:11.978 --> 25:14.462
and blame her for the way
things worked out.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.080
Yeah, I know.

25:15.148 --> 25:17.115
Now's not the time to set her
straight on how to raise her son.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.116
Yeah.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.785
Yeah, well, like I said,

25:19.852 --> 25:21.786
you want to build bridges,
not burn 'em.

25:21.854 --> 25:22.954
(Cell phone rings)

25:23.022 --> 25:25.056
Else the next time she moves,
you might never find her.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.891
Yeah, just hold
that thought, Jack.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.526
Hello.

25:28.593 --> 25:29.894
Whoa, whoa, Janice...

25:30.829 --> 25:32.429
<i>Slow down, honey.</i>

25:32.497 --> 25:34.431
Well, I, I realize
it's important.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.767
But there's nothing I can do
about it right now

25:36.835 --> 25:38.969
because I'm in Moose Jaw.

25:41.072 --> 25:44.274
Well, it's just gonna have
to wait 'til I get back.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.610
Well, maybe you should hear
what Amy has to say.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.614
I mean, that's why
I included her in the deal.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.949
<i>Janice:</i> <i>She doesn't
know</i> <i>what she's doing!</i>

25:53.017 --> 25:54.016
Okay...
(Janice shouts)

25:54.083 --> 25:55.284
Okay...

25:56.219 --> 25:57.986
Okay, yeah.

25:58.054 --> 25:59.821
Well, I gotta go.
Yeah.

25:59.889 --> 26:02.558
I'll talk to you later.

26:02.626 --> 26:05.261
Wow!
Wouldn't you know it?

26:05.328 --> 26:06.595
You get me out
on a road trip

26:06.663 --> 26:08.830
and everything starts
to fall apart back home.

26:11.334 --> 26:12.667
Okay, Amy,

26:12.735 --> 26:14.302
what the hell
do you think you're doing?

26:14.370 --> 26:15.637
Amy:
I told you.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.071
My dad wants me to work
with this horse

26:17.140 --> 26:19.374
and so far, you've ignored
everything I've said.

26:19.442 --> 26:21.976
Scott told you to ease back
and I said the same thing.

26:22.044 --> 26:23.645
So I'm just acting
in my dad's best interest

26:23.712 --> 26:25.079
and taking the horse
to Heartland.

26:25.147 --> 26:27.681
Well, I think your dad's gonna
have something to say about this.

26:27.749 --> 26:28.815
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

26:29.917 --> 26:31.519
Why don't we call him then?

26:31.586 --> 26:33.154
Get him over here,
we can work this out.

26:33.221 --> 26:34.855
Don't bother.
I already talked to him.

26:34.922 --> 26:36.089
Like I said,
he left early this morning,

26:36.158 --> 26:37.791
so he's not coming back
anytime soon.

26:37.859 --> 26:40.561
(Door squeaks
and clunks shut)

26:40.629 --> 26:42.028
All right.

26:42.095 --> 26:42.928
Well, I'm still taking
this horse to Heartland.

26:42.996 --> 26:43.963
(Huffs)
You know what, Amy?

26:44.031 --> 26:45.665
Fine.
Do what you want.

26:45.732 --> 26:46.832
It's your dad's horse,

26:46.900 --> 26:47.767
if you wanna take this horse
back home

26:47.834 --> 26:49.101
and give him some R and R,

26:49.170 --> 26:50.770
it's between you and him.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.275
Who knows?
Maybe while you're at it,

26:55.342 --> 26:56.842
you can teach him to jump
a few fences

26:56.910 --> 26:57.943
like you did with Dexter.

27:04.217 --> 27:05.251
(Truck engine starts)

27:15.427 --> 27:16.761
This is it?

27:16.828 --> 27:18.196
This is it.

27:18.264 --> 27:21.199
<i>And just in time too</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

27:21.267 --> 27:22.133
Tim:
Wish me luck.

27:22.201 --> 27:23.434
Jack:
All right.

27:25.804 --> 27:27.338
Tim:
Can I give you a hand?

27:27.406 --> 27:28.939
Miranda:
What're you doing here?

27:29.007 --> 27:30.907
Tim: I wanted to
see you, Miranda.

27:30.975 --> 27:33.143
I wanted to talk to you.

27:33.211 --> 27:34.378
You know, sort things out.

27:34.445 --> 27:35.445
I wanted to see Shane.

27:35.513 --> 27:37.314
Well, Shane's at school.

27:37.382 --> 27:39.883
I'm hoping to get an early start
tomorrow morning.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.451
Well, why?
Where're you going this time?

27:41.519 --> 27:44.054
Oh, see? This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.588
Having to account to you
for every little decision

27:45.656 --> 27:48.457
I make about where Shane lives
or what he does.

27:48.525 --> 27:50.326
No, you don't have to account
to me for anything.

27:50.394 --> 27:53.362
I just wanted to see my son--
our son.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.397
I mean, that is why
you came to Heartland

27:54.464 --> 27:55.731
in the first place,
isn't it?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.132
Yeah, it was.

27:57.201 --> 27:59.602
But now it's just a little
more complicated.

27:59.670 --> 28:01.170
Well, we're all trying
to do our best here.

28:01.237 --> 28:04.072
Yeah. But you're just trying
a little too hard, Tim.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.375
Ever since you got that
horse back for him,

28:06.442 --> 28:07.942
if he had his own way,

28:08.010 --> 28:10.512
he'd get on that damn bus
every weekend and visit you.

28:10.580 --> 28:11.746
I say he can't,

28:11.814 --> 28:12.514
and then suddenly
you're the hero

28:12.582 --> 28:13.815
and I'm the bad guy.

28:13.883 --> 28:16.084
Well, I'm not trying
to turn him against you.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.452
I mean, that's the last thing
I wanna do.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.587
Well, I guess he's just doing
that on his own.

28:19.655 --> 28:22.123
You know what?
I don't get you.

28:23.058 --> 28:25.527
First of all, you don't even
tell me that I have a son.

28:25.594 --> 28:27.262
And then you want Shane
to have a dad,

28:27.329 --> 28:28.963
instead of filling his head
with all these stories

28:29.031 --> 28:30.598
about some pretend
rodeo star.

28:30.666 --> 28:33.234
Except, Miranda,
I'm the pretend rodeo star!

28:33.301 --> 28:35.202
Yeah. Well,
as far as I'm concerned,

28:35.270 --> 28:36.870
you're as fake
as those stories.

28:36.938 --> 28:40.073
So how about you just go back
home to your real family

28:40.142 --> 28:41.142
and leave us alone.

28:41.209 --> 28:42.909
You can't lie to him!

28:42.977 --> 28:44.678
<i>I'm his father!</i>

28:44.746 --> 28:45.879
I have proof!

28:47.582 --> 28:48.682
<i>Agh!</i>

28:52.052 --> 28:53.853
(Sighs heavily)

29:00.060 --> 29:01.361
(Door slams shut)

29:02.430 --> 29:03.930
Well,

29:03.998 --> 29:07.200
I guess you just love
the smell of burning bridges.

29:08.235 --> 29:09.668
(Ignition starts)

29:11.538 --> 29:14.207
Amy! Do you know
what time it is?

29:14.274 --> 29:16.109
What're you doing?

29:16.176 --> 29:18.744
Amy: Well, the first plan would
be to get him out of the trailer

29:18.812 --> 29:20.513
and all settled
into the barn.

29:20.581 --> 29:22.347
This is Cisco,
my dad's new racehorse.

29:22.415 --> 29:23.615
I think there's something wrong
with his legs.

29:23.683 --> 29:24.616
I don't care about
the horse,

29:24.684 --> 29:26.618
I don't care
about its legs.

29:26.686 --> 29:29.188
You have a date with Ty;
You need to get ready.

29:29.255 --> 29:30.289
Ready?

29:30.356 --> 29:31.790
Mallory, I am ready.
It's just Ty.

29:31.857 --> 29:32.991
He knows what I look like.

29:33.059 --> 29:34.526
I don't have to put on
something fancy.

29:34.594 --> 29:36.228
You can't take him
for granted!

29:36.296 --> 29:37.628
Mallory,
I've got work to do.

29:37.696 --> 29:39.230
Okay?
Ty will understand.

29:39.298 --> 29:41.566
I know I wasn't down with
the whole Ty moves out thing,

29:41.633 --> 29:42.934
but now that
you've made that choice,

29:43.001 --> 29:44.702
you have to make it work.

29:44.770 --> 29:46.938
So I'll take Cisco,
you go get ready.

29:47.005 --> 29:48.473
And I don't mean ready

29:48.541 --> 29:50.241
like you don't stink too much
of horses and manure.

29:50.309 --> 29:52.444
I mean really ready.
Date ready.

29:52.511 --> 29:53.544
(Sighs)
Thanks.

30:06.591 --> 30:07.658
(Spits)

30:17.235 --> 30:18.301
(Timer dings)

30:29.980 --> 30:31.047
(Oven door squeaks shut)

30:32.516 --> 30:33.917
(Under his breath)
There we go.

30:34.951 --> 30:36.018
All right...

30:37.053 --> 30:38.119
Whew.

30:48.665 --> 30:49.765
(Raccoon chatters quietly)

30:54.737 --> 30:56.804
Hey, Mallory?
Is Amy around?

30:56.872 --> 30:59.106
She's in the house.

30:59.174 --> 31:00.508
I'm glad
you didn't overdo it.

31:00.576 --> 31:02.376
Because if you show someone
you care,

31:02.444 --> 31:04.145
next thing you know,
they've torn out your heart

31:04.212 --> 31:05.646
and they're line dancing
on it.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.516
Ty.

31:14.922 --> 31:16.323
You look great.

31:16.390 --> 31:17.324
So do you.

31:17.391 --> 31:18.992
Ty:
No, really.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.460
You look great.

31:20.527 --> 31:22.095
So do you.

31:22.529 --> 31:24.096
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Oh please!
</i> <i>Get out of here now,</i>

31:24.164 --> 31:25.597
or I swear,

31:25.665 --> 31:26.999
if I hear how great
someone looks one more time,

31:27.067 --> 31:28.367
I'm gonna hurl!

31:28.435 --> 31:29.501
Come on.

31:31.704 --> 31:34.307
Ty:
Oh. Let me get that.

31:34.374 --> 31:36.442
Amy:
Oh, thank you.

31:46.018 --> 31:47.718
Ty:
I got a pie for dessert,

31:47.786 --> 31:49.321
and it's your favourite--

31:49.388 --> 31:50.788
Saskatoon Berry.

31:51.924 --> 31:53.691
There is nothing too good
for my girl.

31:53.759 --> 31:54.826
Come on.

31:58.630 --> 31:59.696
(Chattering)

32:04.669 --> 32:07.338
(Dishes clatter,
glass shatter)

32:11.742 --> 32:13.843
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

32:13.912 --> 32:15.045
Wow.

32:15.113 --> 32:18.248
And I thought Caleb
was a slob.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.266
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Where did he go?</i>

32:22.436 --> 32:24.003
<i>Oh! Geez! Ty!</i>
<i>(Laughs)</i>

32:24.071 --> 32:25.738
He's under the bed!

32:27.674 --> 32:29.542
Oh! Okay, just, just...

32:29.609 --> 32:31.210
Go really slow.
We don't wanna spook him.

32:31.277 --> 32:32.778
And take the pressure off
when he goes the right way.

32:32.846 --> 32:34.980
Okay, we wanna make him think
it's his own idea.

32:35.048 --> 32:37.115
(Raccoon trills loudly)
Amy: Get up, get up, get up!

32:37.183 --> 32:38.317
Where'd he go?

32:38.385 --> 32:39.918
<i>(Distant chattering)</i>

32:39.986 --> 32:41.319
Ty:
He's over there.

32:41.387 --> 32:42.787
(Raccoon trills)

32:45.491 --> 32:46.725
(Whispering)
Okay... okay.

32:46.792 --> 32:47.726
Go from this side.

32:47.793 --> 32:48.960
Okay.

32:49.027 --> 32:50.895
(Chatters and squeals)

32:51.831 --> 32:53.565
Where'd he go?

32:57.001 --> 32:58.635
(Gasps) Geez, Ty!
He's right here.

32:58.703 --> 33:01.104
(Ty yelps,
raccoon chatters)

33:05.744 --> 33:08.479
So much for our big
romantic date, huh?

33:08.546 --> 33:10.514
What, you're not gonna
bail on me, are you?

33:10.582 --> 33:12.015
We could always go back
to Heartland

33:12.083 --> 33:14.551
and eat leftovers
with Mallory.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.153
Is that the best
you can come up with?

33:17.221 --> 33:18.855
Well, what do you
have in mind?

33:21.592 --> 33:23.460
Ty: I didn't know you liked
die chop woi chow mein.

33:23.527 --> 33:25.395
Amy and Ty:
(Laugh)

33:25.463 --> 33:28.164
Amy: And I didn't know you
were so good with chopsticks.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.734
Ty: Well, when I was
living with my dad,

33:31.802 --> 33:33.569
we ate a lot of takeout.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.738
Too much takeout, actually.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.708
That's why I taught myself
how to cook.

33:38.775 --> 33:42.177
You know, this plan of yours
is working.

33:42.245 --> 33:43.779
You move out
and suddenly,

33:43.847 --> 33:45.314
we're learning all these
new things about each other.

33:45.381 --> 33:46.948
(Cell phone rings)

33:48.250 --> 33:49.284
Ah, it's Lou.

33:49.352 --> 33:51.085
So, pick it up.

33:51.153 --> 33:52.554
Hey, Lou.

33:52.622 --> 33:53.855
(Exhales)

33:53.923 --> 33:55.857
Okay, well, I,
I can't talk right now.

33:55.925 --> 33:57.225
Uh... yeah.

33:57.293 --> 34:00.428
I'm sure Peter's mom
is a total monster.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.696
Come on.

34:01.764 --> 34:03.030
No, look how Peter
turned out.

34:03.098 --> 34:05.733
It can't be that bad.
(Laughs)

34:05.801 --> 34:07.635
Kay, well, I can't talk.

34:07.703 --> 34:10.137
I'm on a date right now.

34:10.205 --> 34:11.972
No, with Ty.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.608
Hey, Lou.

34:14.543 --> 34:16.277
No, it's not unbelievable.

34:16.311 --> 34:17.978
It's good.

34:18.045 --> 34:19.112
It's nice.

34:20.214 --> 34:21.181
Okay.

34:21.248 --> 34:22.683
Bye.

34:22.751 --> 34:24.451
Sorry.

34:24.518 --> 34:25.918
It's good?

34:25.987 --> 34:27.688
Just nice?

34:27.755 --> 34:29.489
It's perfect.

34:29.556 --> 34:31.858
But I just didn't want Lou
to feel bad

34:31.926 --> 34:33.627
about being stuck
in Estevan.

34:34.895 --> 34:35.962
(Laughs)

34:43.871 --> 34:45.804
<i>(Car rumbles by)</i>

34:46.741 --> 34:50.175
Jack: Well, we're good to go.
The place is practically empty.

34:51.110 --> 34:52.545
Tim:
I wonder why?

34:53.480 --> 34:54.847
Well, it must be my lucky day.

34:54.914 --> 34:56.815
I get to stay
in some fleabag motel

34:56.882 --> 34:58.351
on the outskirts
of Moose Jaw.

34:58.418 --> 35:00.620
Jack: It's the only
place with vacancies.

35:00.687 --> 35:01.754
It's really starting
to remind me

35:01.821 --> 35:04.756
of the old circuit days now,
Jack.

35:04.824 --> 35:07.226
Hey, all we need's a mini-bar
that neither of us can afford.

35:07.293 --> 35:10.629
You got yourself
into this mess, so...

35:10.697 --> 35:12.897
You only have yourself
to blame.

35:12.965 --> 35:16.368
<i>Tim:</i> <i>I'm not blaming
myself,</i> <i>Jack.</i>

35:19.239 --> 35:21.105
I'm blaming you.

35:23.075 --> 35:24.141
(Grunts)

35:25.678 --> 35:27.245
You get the floor.

35:53.804 --> 35:55.338
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Yeah, and then he
looks at us</i> <i>all offended,</i>

35:55.406 --> 35:57.207
like he owned the place
and we just interrupted

35:57.275 --> 36:00.109
his private little raccoon
dinner party.

36:00.178 --> 36:01.611
You do know that raccoons

36:01.679 --> 36:03.647
are the number one carriers
of rabies

36:03.714 --> 36:04.648
in North America?

36:04.715 --> 36:06.115
Oh, Mallory!

36:06.184 --> 36:07.617
There hasn't been a single
documented case in Alberta!

36:07.685 --> 36:08.784
Okay?
And you should've seen him.

36:08.852 --> 36:10.186
He was so cute!

36:10.254 --> 36:11.420
Well, tell me how cute
they are

36:11.488 --> 36:12.921
when you're writhing
on your deathbed,

36:12.989 --> 36:14.490
foaming at the mouth,

36:14.558 --> 36:16.225
body twisted up
like a pretzel...

36:16.293 --> 36:17.260
That's gross.

36:17.327 --> 36:18.894
Yeah.
You know what, Mallory?

36:18.962 --> 36:21.197
You've been like the voice
of doom for days.

36:21.265 --> 36:22.398
What's going on with you?

36:22.466 --> 36:23.932
Remember that
Spring Fling?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.066
Amy:
Yeah.

36:25.134 --> 36:26.834
You went solo with Jake?

36:26.902 --> 36:29.737
Mallory: Yeah. I know I said
he was just giving me a ride.

36:29.805 --> 36:31.206
But really,

36:31.274 --> 36:32.840
I was hoping that we could
spend some time together

36:32.907 --> 36:34.442
and we could pick up
where we left off.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.144
I'm guessing
that didn't happen?

36:36.211 --> 36:38.379
Mallory: The ride to
the dance was great.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.014
But as soon as we actually
got there,

36:40.081 --> 36:41.182
I'd reminded him
so many times

36:41.250 --> 36:42.183
that we were going solo

36:42.251 --> 36:44.318
he actually believed it.

36:44.386 --> 36:45.520
The second we got out
of the car,

36:45.587 --> 36:47.755
we didn't talk,
we didn't dance.

36:47.822 --> 36:48.855
I barely even saw him.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.892
So much for if you love someone,
set them free.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.662
Well, maybe you should
just be straight with him.

36:55.730 --> 36:57.364
Maybe then
he'll come around?

36:57.432 --> 36:59.500
Yeah, yeah.
And if he doesn't?

36:59.567 --> 37:03.137
It wasn't meant to be,
aka the story of my life.

37:03.204 --> 37:05.738
Mallory,
these things take time.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.640
These things take time?

37:07.708 --> 37:09.375
That's it?
The pep talk?

37:09.443 --> 37:11.010
That's the best you've got?

37:11.078 --> 37:12.479
Wow, that sucks!

37:12.546 --> 37:14.847
Okay, maybe it did.

37:14.915 --> 37:16.316
But I do know one thing.

37:16.383 --> 37:17.584
What happened with Jake,

37:17.651 --> 37:19.652
that's not gonna be
the story of your life.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.220
Promise?

37:21.288 --> 37:23.122
No guarantees.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.323
But I'll bet
in a few weeks,

37:24.391 --> 37:25.657
you'll have forgotten
all about him.

37:25.725 --> 37:26.925
(Cell phone rings)

37:27.860 --> 37:29.795
(Phone beeps)
Or not!

37:29.862 --> 37:31.597
It's a text from Jake.

37:32.532 --> 37:34.032
He wants me to meet him
at Maggie's!

37:34.101 --> 37:36.634
Can you please give me a ride?

37:44.243 --> 37:45.310
(Knocking)

37:46.879 --> 37:49.214
(Dog barks in the distance)

37:51.050 --> 37:52.149
Oh Jack, not you too.

37:52.217 --> 37:53.450
Ah...

37:53.517 --> 37:55.085
Miranda, wait.

37:56.020 --> 37:59.590
Please, get your foot
outta my door.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.960
You can close the door
on me.

38:03.027 --> 38:04.427
But if you close the door
on Tim,

38:04.495 --> 38:05.929
you'll never know
what could've been,

38:05.997 --> 38:08.565
you'll never know if you made
the right decision,

38:08.599 --> 38:09.799
and you'll never know

38:09.867 --> 38:10.900
how much your son
could've gained

38:10.968 --> 38:13.135
from getting to know
his father.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.470
I'm sorry.

38:14.538 --> 38:16.773
Then listen to this.

38:18.809 --> 38:20.176
If you let Tim
into your life,

38:20.243 --> 38:21.945
Shane won't just be
gaining a father,

38:22.012 --> 38:24.146
he'll be gaining
a whole family.

38:24.214 --> 38:27.115
Yeah, that's the whole problem
right there.

38:27.183 --> 38:28.350
From your point of view,

38:28.418 --> 38:29.818
Shane stands to gain
a whole new family.

38:29.886 --> 38:31.219
Which is a good thing,
yes.

38:31.287 --> 38:34.423
But have you thought about
what that does to me?

38:36.426 --> 38:38.627
I can't compete
with you guys.

38:40.363 --> 38:43.398
And I'm afraid I'm gonna lose
my son in the process.

38:43.465 --> 38:47.235
I understand how you feel.
I... I do.

38:47.302 --> 38:49.270
But now that the door's
been opened,

38:49.338 --> 38:52.373
I'm not so sure
you can close it again.

38:52.441 --> 38:55.376
Believe me, Jack,
I've thought about that.

38:55.444 --> 38:56.511
A lot.

38:57.412 --> 39:00.214
I know
it's a tough decision.

39:00.281 --> 39:01.448
But I'm here to ask you

39:01.517 --> 39:03.217
to think about it
a little more

39:03.284 --> 39:06.186
before you decide.

39:07.489 --> 39:08.523
Okay,

39:09.725 --> 39:12.626
I promise
I'll think about it.

39:12.694 --> 39:14.327
Okay.

39:14.395 --> 39:17.330
You know you're not at all
like the hard-ass son of a bitch

39:17.398 --> 39:20.133
Tim used to tell me about.

39:22.370 --> 39:23.604
(Chuckles)

39:34.247 --> 39:36.315
Come on.
(Tv show plays)

39:39.319 --> 39:40.887
(Horn honks twice)

39:43.891 --> 39:45.858
(Horn honks)
Tim: Whoa!

39:47.360 --> 39:49.027
God! What's going on?
I thought you ditched me.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.696
Where the hell you been?

39:51.665 --> 39:52.898
I picked up some breakfast.

39:52.966 --> 39:55.734
So come on,
we can eat on the road.

39:57.370 --> 39:58.571
You've been gone for hours.

39:58.638 --> 40:00.772
Now, suddenly,
you're in a big rush?

40:00.840 --> 40:02.173
What about Miranda?

40:02.240 --> 40:04.976
Think we should try
that one again?

40:05.043 --> 40:07.111
I don't know that
that's such a good idea.

40:07.179 --> 40:08.746
Shane needs to know
who his father is.

40:08.814 --> 40:11.082
Well, maybe it's Miranda's
responsibility

40:11.149 --> 40:12.416
to tell Shane,

40:12.485 --> 40:13.818
and your responsibility
to tell your daughters.

40:13.886 --> 40:14.953
Okay! All right!

40:16.621 --> 40:17.688
I'll tell 'em.

40:19.156 --> 40:21.257
As soon as Lou gets back.

40:21.325 --> 40:22.659
Speaking of which,

40:22.727 --> 40:25.228
you know, Estevan's just
a few miles up the road.

40:25.296 --> 40:28.632
We could just stop in...
Meet the new in-laws.

40:28.700 --> 40:29.833
Jack:
I don't think so.

40:34.137 --> 40:35.872
(Hoofbeats thud)

40:37.608 --> 40:39.675
Ty: Well, I'm still not sure
how this is helping Cisco

40:39.743 --> 40:41.343
get ready for the track.

40:41.411 --> 40:43.345
Amy: He's just getting used
to the saddle and bridle

40:43.413 --> 40:45.615
and being around other horses.

40:45.682 --> 40:48.684
And he's getting used to not
being distracted by new things.

40:48.751 --> 40:50.418
Well, maybe if you stopped
blocking my way,

40:50.487 --> 40:51.854
I could help you out.

40:51.921 --> 40:53.722
Well, he's gotta learn
how to be the leader,

40:53.790 --> 40:55.290
not the follower.

40:55.358 --> 40:56.992
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Kinda like you?</i>

40:57.059 --> 40:59.828
What does that mean,
like me?

40:59.896 --> 41:01.162
Ty: You say you're trying
to teach the horse

41:01.230 --> 41:02.531
how to be in the front,

41:02.599 --> 41:04.199
but I think it's you
who wants to be in the lead.

41:04.266 --> 41:06.334
Amy:
No, that is not true at all.

41:06.401 --> 41:08.970
I'm just seeing
if has a competitive spirit.

41:09.037 --> 41:11.539
Ty: Well, you know there's only
one way to find out for sure.

41:11.607 --> 41:13.274
Ty... Ty, no!

41:14.376 --> 41:15.477
(Groans)

41:15.544 --> 41:16.611
Okay, fine.

41:35.396 --> 41:36.463
Woo-hoo!

41:46.269 --> 41:48.603
<i>(Raccoons squeak and chatter)</i>

41:50.840 --> 41:53.375
Okay.
It comes down to two choices:

41:53.443 --> 41:56.511
Somewhere really close
to Janice's trailer...

41:56.779 --> 41:59.447
Or out by the Sheep river.

41:59.515 --> 42:00.816
I call heads.

42:00.883 --> 42:02.450
(Raccoons chatter)

42:03.452 --> 42:04.419
Heads it is.

42:04.486 --> 42:05.854
Sheep river wins.

42:05.922 --> 42:08.323
Best two out of three?

42:11.427 --> 42:13.395
Janice: So, you wanted
to show me something?

42:13.462 --> 42:14.529
Tim:
Cisco.

42:17.966 --> 42:20.302
He's getting along well
with the other horses,

42:20.369 --> 42:23.538
the swelling in his leg's
gone down.

42:23.606 --> 42:26.007
I'm glad you worked
your differences out with Amy.

42:26.074 --> 42:28.909
Well to be honest, Tim,
lightening up the schedule,

42:28.977 --> 42:31.245
letting him be a horse
for awhile...

42:31.313 --> 42:33.281
None of that
was really my idea.

42:33.348 --> 42:36.350
Well, you didn't stand
in her way.

42:36.418 --> 42:37.652
Yeah.

42:37.719 --> 42:40.421
Well, we'll just...
Take it slow,

42:41.356 --> 42:42.689
see what happens.

42:42.757 --> 42:44.524
You all right with that?

42:44.592 --> 42:45.659
So far, so good.

42:45.726 --> 42:46.959
(Cell phone rings)

42:47.895 --> 42:50.463
- I gotta take this.
- Sure.

42:51.732 --> 42:52.799
Hello? Yeah.

42:54.234 --> 42:56.303
Miranda, hi.
Yeah.

42:57.772 --> 42:58.737
<i>Oh, so you're not moving?</i>

42:58.805 --> 43:00.572
<i>Okay, good. Good, great.</i>

43:00.640 --> 43:02.308
See?
We're communicating now.

43:02.375 --> 43:03.442
(Laughs)

43:04.511 --> 43:06.444
Okay, good.

43:06.512 --> 43:07.578
Bye.

43:10.816 --> 43:12.049
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

43:12.117 --> 43:13.418
Are you sure
about this spot?

43:13.485 --> 43:14.619
Well, yeah.

43:14.687 --> 43:15.787
The river's right there,

43:15.854 --> 43:17.922
so they got lots of food
and water.

43:17.989 --> 43:19.890
It's okay, little guys.

43:19.958 --> 43:21.158
And there are no houses
around here,

43:21.226 --> 43:24.328
so I'd say
it's pretty much perfect.

43:24.395 --> 43:25.629
I guess.

43:28.065 --> 43:29.899
(Raccoons squeal)

43:29.967 --> 43:31.601
<i>Amy:</i> <i>You're not gonna miss</i>
<i>these little guys, are ya?</i>

43:31.669 --> 43:33.002
No way!

43:33.070 --> 43:34.371
I'm just making sure
we're far enough away

43:34.439 --> 43:36.139
so there's no chance
of them coming back.

43:36.207 --> 43:38.207
'Cause if they show up again,
I'm going for the gun.

43:38.274 --> 43:40.142
Yeah, right.

43:40.210 --> 43:41.143
Stand back.

43:41.211 --> 43:42.277
Okay.

43:43.513 --> 43:45.981
(Raccoons chatter and squeal)

43:50.220 --> 43:52.621
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Bye, Rocky!
</i> <i>Bye, Bullwinkle!</i>

43:52.689 --> 43:55.357
Rocky? Bullwinkle?
What're you talking about?

43:55.424 --> 43:57.492
Well, why not?

43:57.560 --> 43:59.093
Well, 'cause Rocky's
a squirrel

43:59.161 --> 44:00.995
and Bullwinkle's a moose.

44:01.063 --> 44:02.397
Yeah,
so if Rocky's a squirrel,

44:02.465 --> 44:05.266
why can't Bullwinkle be
a raccoon?

44:05.334 --> 44:06.401
(Laughs)

44:07.970 --> 44:10.036
âª I miss you when âª

44:10.104 --> 44:13.374
âª I miss you when you're gone âª

44:14.308 --> 44:15.609
âª I miss you when âª

44:16.544 --> 44:18.545
There he goes.

44:18.613 --> 44:21.915
âª I miss you when you're gone âª
