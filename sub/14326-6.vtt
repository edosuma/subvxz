09:46.043 --> 09:47.503
[GRR]

09:47.586 --> 09:48.838
I MUST OBEY.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.423
I WANT TO PLEASE.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.966
NOW, COSMO!

09:56.178 --> 09:57.638
[GRR]

09:57.722 --> 09:59.682
AAH!

10:01.309 --> 10:02.226
DON'T YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME A COOKIE?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.645
A REALLY BIG COOKIE?

10:05.521 --> 10:09.984
{\an1}CANNOT REFUSE
YOUR SILLIEST WHIM.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.572
AND MILK.

10:17.658 --> 10:21.245
COSMO, PLEASE,
YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.927
[SHOUTING]

10:42.058 --> 10:43.601
[GRR]

10:45.061 --> 10:46.145
Both: YAY, COSMO!

10:46.228 --> 10:48.522
YAY, ME!

10:51.233 --> 10:53.235
COSMO, YOU DID IT.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.571
YOU WON THE FAIRY
RAGE IN THE CAGE.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.156
AND NOW YOU GET
TO CHOOSE

10:57.239 --> 10:59.283
WHOSE FAIRY GODPARENT
YOU WANT TO BE.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.248
ROCK, IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S ME.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.833
OK, IT'S YOU.

11:13.005 --> 11:13.798
I WANT THAT ROCK.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.092
ECCH! YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIGHT ME FOR IT.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.386
Fairies: AAH!

11:18.469 --> 11:21.555
CAN WE PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.685
{\an1}Cosmo: AND YOU SAID
THE RETURN TUBE

11:26.769 --> 11:28.938
{\an1}FROM TEXAS TO DIMMSDALE
WAS A DUMB WISH.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.443
OH, MAN,
LESSON LEARNED:

11:34.527 --> 11:36.612
{\an5}IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN BEING WANTED
BY EVERYBODY

11:36.695 --> 11:38.823
{\an5}AND IGNORED
BY EVERYBODY EXCEPT
MY FRIENDS,

11:38.906 --> 11:40.616
I WISH I WAS IGNORED.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.451
TIMMY, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHOOSE

11:42.535 --> 11:44.245
YOUR WISHES
CAREFULLY.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.371
{\an1}DONE!

11:46.705 --> 11:48.249
THANKS, GUYS.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.834
GUYS?

11:49.917 --> 11:50.835
OH, GUYS?

11:50.918 --> 11:51.001
GUYS!

11:57.383 --> 11:59.552
{\an1}WE'RE IGNORING
TIMMY IN FRANCE?

11:59.635 --> 12:04.014
{\an5}HA! AND YOU SAID
THE ESCAPE POD TO PARIS
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.476
AAH!

12:07.560 --> 12:10.563
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

12:31.750 --> 12:33.794
Cosmo: IT WAS
REALLY NICE OF YOU

12:33.878 --> 12:36.088
{\an5}TO TAKE US
TO THE POINTY CROWN,
MAMA COSMA.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.842
Mama Cosma: WELL,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.760
{\an1}IT IS FAIRY WORLD'S
MOST FAMOUS RESTAURANT.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.931
{\an1}ONLY THE FINEST FOR
MY LITTLE COSMO LOO LOO.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.391
AND IT WAS REALLY
NICE OF YOU

12:47.475 --> 12:48.642
TO INVITE TIMMY
AND WANDA.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.853
HI, TIMMY AND WANDA.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.857
OW!

12:54.940 --> 12:55.733
UNH!

12:55.816 --> 12:57.401
{\an1}DID WE HAVE TO COME
TO FAIRY WORLD

12:57.485 --> 12:59.528
{\an1}TO HAVE LUNCH
WITH COSMO'S MOM?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.362
OW!

13:00.446 --> 13:04.033
YOU KNOW WHAT
A MAMA'S BOY COSMO IS.

13:04.116 --> 13:04.992
OW!

13:05.075 --> 13:07.620
{\an1}BUT THE ONLY TIME
SHE EVER INCLUDES US...

13:07.703 --> 13:08.496
Both: OW!

13:08.579 --> 13:09.872
IS WHEN IT INVOLVES
SOME SINISTER PLOT

13:09.955 --> 13:10.206
TO GET RID OF YOU...

13:10.289 --> 13:12.208
Both: OW!

13:12.291 --> 13:13.209
{\an1}AND TO GET HIM TO MOVE
BACK HOME WITH HER.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.376
Waiter: WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CHOCOLATE PUDDING?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.337
THAT DEPENDS.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.214
{\an1}WHICH DOOR DID
YOU COME OUT OF?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.091
{\an1}Waiter: EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU COSMO?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.844
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
ON MY UNDIES,

13:23.928 --> 13:27.431
{\an8}AND THEY'VE NEVER
LIED TO ME BEFORE.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.558
{\an1}HOW CAN WE HELP YOU,
MYSTERIOUS WAITER

13:29.642 --> 13:31.227
WHOM I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.229
I'M NOT REALLY A WAITER.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.190
{\an1}I'M BILLY CRYSTAL BALL,
AND THAT'S NOT REALLY PUDDING.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.901
Both: OW!

13:38.984 --> 13:41.445
IT'S REALLY FAIRY WORLD'S
FAVORITE TV SHOW,

13:41.529 --> 13:44.740
<i>THIS IS YOUR WISH!</i>

13:44.823 --> 13:46.116
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

13:50.704 --> 13:52.790
{\an1}AH! OH, MY GOSH!
THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.210
{\an5}I'M JUST AS
SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE,

13:56.293 --> 13:57.920
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.923
{\an1}HI, TIMMY!
HI, WANDA!

14:02.883 --> 14:04.093
WHAT?!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.679
{\an1}THIS HAS TO BE SOME
SORT OF DIABOLICAL PLOT.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.765
TIMMY, ORDINARILY
I'D AGREE WITH YOU...

14:09.848 --> 14:10.724
Both: OW!

14:10.808 --> 14:11.684
BUT THE SLIGHT
CONCUSSION

14:11.767 --> 14:14.728
IS MAKING ME
LESS SUSPICIOUS.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.814
HAS THAT HAT ALWAYS
BEEN ORANGE?

14:16.897 --> 14:19.149
{\an1}Billy: WELCOME TO THE SHOW
WHERE WE HONOR A SPECIAL GUEST

14:19.233 --> 14:20.734
BY RELIVING THE HIGHLIGHTS
OF THEIR LIVES.

14:20.818 --> 14:25.906
COSMO, DO YOU
RECOGNIZE THIS VOICE?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.243
I LOVE MY LITTLE
COSMO DEARLY,

14:29.326 --> 14:30.286
AND EVER SINCE
HE WAS BORN,

14:30.369 --> 14:33.122
I'VE BEEN TERRIFIED
OF LOSING HIM.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.083
I REMEMBER WHEN COSMO
GOT HIS FIRST WAND.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.042
DAD!

14:37.126 --> 14:39.253
COME ON, COSMO.
FLY TO DADDY.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.171
HMM? YAY!

14:45.509 --> 14:47.928
{\an1}GIVE MOMMY
THE WAND, COSMO.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.599
GIVE MOMMY THE WAND!

14:50.514 --> 14:51.599
YAY!

14:51.682 --> 14:54.059
DADDY! DADDY!
DADDY!

14:54.143 --> 14:56.228
{\an1}Mama Cosma, voice-over:
COSMO HAD MANY INTERESTS,

14:56.312 --> 14:57.479
WHETHER IT WAS ART...

14:57.563 --> 14:58.063
{\an1}I'M GONNA MAKE
A DAISY--

15:01.483 --> 15:03.235
AN EXPLODING DAISY!

15:03.319 --> 15:05.696
{\an1}Mama Cosma, voice-over:
HE ALSO LOVED SPORTS.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.989
PULL!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.838
[ROARS]

15:24.256 --> 15:25.799
IT'S SNOWBALL!

15:25.883 --> 15:27.926
All: AAH!

15:29.928 --> 15:31.430
{\an1}WHO'S THAT IDIOT
WITH THE GREEN HAIR?

15:31.513 --> 15:33.891
{\an1}IT WAS AFTER THAT
YOU WERE SENTENCED--

15:33.974 --> 15:37.436
{\an1}I MEAN SENT TO A SPECIAL SCHOOL
FOR SPECIAL FAIRY CHILDREN

15:37.519 --> 15:39.021
LIKE YOU!

15:39.104 --> 15:43.525
COSMO, DO YOU
RECOGNIZE THIS RAGE?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.694
Jorgen: COSMO,
YOU BUMBLING IDIOT!

15:45.778 --> 15:47.237
THAT COULD BE ANYBODY.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.698
IT IS ME,
JORGEN VON STRANGLE,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.367
TOUGHEST FAIRY
IN THE UNIVERSE.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.370
{\an1}WAIT. IT'S ON THE TIP
OF MY TONGUE.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.372
Billy: WE BROUGHT JORGEN HERE

15:56.455 --> 15:57.581
{\an1}TO TELL US ABOUT
YOUR FUN-FILLED DAYS

15:57.665 --> 15:59.333
AT THE FAIRY ACADEMY.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.336
AH, YES,

16:02.419 --> 16:04.421
I REMEMBER THE PAIN
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.382
I WAS A 5-STAR
FAIRY COMMANDER

16:06.465 --> 16:08.300
WHEN COSMO
VOLUNTARILY JOINED US

16:08.384 --> 16:09.551
AT THE FAIRY ACADEMY.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.596
NO! I DON'T WANT TO GO!

16:12.680 --> 16:15.015
{\an1}MOMMY!

16:15.099 --> 16:16.642
WELCOME TO THE FAIRY
ACADEMY.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.394
PRESENT WANDS--

16:18.477 --> 16:19.728
AND BY PRESENT WANDS

16:19.812 --> 16:21.522
I MEAN DON'T
DO ANYTHING

16:21.605 --> 16:23.190
{\an5}TO EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF
THE BRASS.

16:31.990 --> 16:32.116
Cosmo: SNOWBALL!

16:37.955 --> 16:40.165
YOU, CLEAN TOILETS

16:40.249 --> 16:41.875
FOREVER!

16:41.959 --> 16:43.502
BUT COSMO IMPROVED
OVER TIME, RIGHT?

16:43.585 --> 16:45.045
WRONG!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.630
{\an5}Jorgen: NO MATTER
WHERE COSMO WAS TAKEN
FOR TRAINING,

16:46.714 --> 16:47.965
IT ENDED IN DISASTER...

16:48.048 --> 16:49.717
{\an1}WHETHER IT WAS
THE SHINING UTOPIA

16:49.800 --> 16:50.759
THAT WAS POMPEII...

16:50.843 --> 16:53.929
{\an1}I KNOW HOW TO
MAKE IT WARMER.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.767
THE SPARKLING UTOPIA
THAT WAS ATLANTIS...

16:58.851 --> 17:01.145
{\an1}I KNOW HOW TO
MAKE IT CLEANER.

17:04.772 --> 17:07.108
OR THE HIGH-TECH
GLEAMING UTOPIA

17:07.192 --> 17:09.111
THAT WAS ONCE XANADU...

17:09.194 --> 17:11.655
I CALL IT PITTSBURGH!

17:14.450 --> 17:16.285
THOSE POOR PEOPLE.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.203
WE CAN NEVER
REBUILD THEIR LIVES.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.955
{\an5}I LOST EVERY ONE
OF MY 5 STARS
THAT DAY,

17:21.039 --> 17:23.040
AND IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT

17:23.125 --> 17:24.460
I WILL GRIND YOUR
BONES INTO DUST.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.503
AARGH!

17:33.719 --> 17:36.180
Audience: OOH!

17:36.263 --> 17:37.473
SERIOUSLY, WHO WAS THAT GUY?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.976
{\an1}WOW! THAT COSMO
IS A TOTAL IDIOT.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.436
HE'S A DANGER
TO HIMSELF

17:42.519 --> 17:43.645
AND EVERYONE
AROUND HIM.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.814
I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE

17:45.898 --> 17:47.649
SO WE CAN TAKE
HIS WAND AWAY

17:47.733 --> 17:49.818
{\an5}AND MAKE HIM
MOVE BACK HOME
WITH HIS MAMA.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.861
WHAT?!

17:50.944 --> 17:52.446
YOU MEAN THE AUDIENCE
GETS TO VOTE

17:52.529 --> 17:55.908
{\an5}ON WHETHER COSMO
GETS TO STAY
A GODPARENT OR NOT?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.993
{\an5}I DON'T REMEMBER
THAT BEING PART
OF THE SHOW.

17:58.076 --> 17:58.994
OH, THE RATINGS
WERE GOING DOWN,

17:59.077 --> 18:02.289
SO THEY ADDED THAT
DURING SEASON 3.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.333
{\an1}I KNEW IT!
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON

18:04.416 --> 18:06.168
{\an1}MAMA COSMA WAS BEING
SO NICE TO US.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.546
{\an1}IT'S ANOTHER PLOT TO GET
COSMO AWAY FROM YOU AND ME!

18:09.630 --> 18:12.132
{\an5}WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT COMPLETELY
CORRECT IDEA?

18:12.216 --> 18:14.051
OVER MY DEAD BODY!

18:14.134 --> 18:15.677
OH, YOU FIGURED OUT

18:15.761 --> 18:16.386
THE REST
OF THE PLAN?

18:19.389 --> 18:23.185
COSMO, DO YOU
RECOGNIZE THIS VOICE?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.228
COSMO,

18:24.311 --> 18:26.355
{\an5}YOUR MOTHER
IS TRYING TO
SEPARATE US AGAIN.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.022
UM, DENISE?

18:27.105 --> 18:29.107
THIS WHOLE THING
IS A PLOT

18:29.191 --> 18:31.777
{\an5}TO GET YOU ALL
TO THINK COSMO'S
A BAD FAIRY

18:31.860 --> 18:32.945
AND GET HIM
TO LOSE HIS JOB

18:33.028 --> 18:35.197
AND MOVE BACK HOME
WITH HIS MOTHER.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.115
{\an1}BRIGITTE?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.533
BUT I HAVE ONE
SPECIAL CLIP

18:37.616 --> 18:41.662
{\an5}THAT WILL SHOW WHAT
A WONDERFUL HUSBAND,
FAIRY, AND FRIEND

18:41.745 --> 18:42.454
COSMO CAN BE.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.790
JORGEN!

18:47.709 --> 18:48.585
Both: AAH!

18:48.669 --> 18:50.712
WE'RE DOOMED!

18:50.796 --> 18:53.257
WHO CAN SAVE US?

18:53.340 --> 18:53.882
ME, COSMO,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.844
THE GREATEST FAIRY EVER!

18:56.927 --> 18:58.971
Wanda: STOP THE CLIP!

18:59.054 --> 19:00.973
SEE? COSMO
ACTUALLY SAVED US

19:01.056 --> 19:03.559
FROM A HORRIBLE
CLICHED DEATH.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.852
All: THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

19:04.935 --> 19:05.936
LET HIM KEEP HIS JOB.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.939
ROLL THE REST
OF THE CLIP.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.941
{\an1}I'LL JUST SET YOU DOWN
NICE AND SAFE

19:11.024 --> 19:12.693
ON THESE SHINY METAL TRACKS,

19:12.776 --> 19:15.696
{\an1}AND TO KEEP YOU WARM,
HERE'S A ROPE COAT.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.909
Both: AAH!

19:20.993 --> 19:23.036
Mama Cosma:
STOP THE CLIP.

19:23.120 --> 19:23.579
SEE? HE'S TERRIBLE.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.206
SEND HIM HOME.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.041
ROLL THE REST
OF THE CLIP!

19:31.753 --> 19:33.672
Both: AHH!

19:33.755 --> 19:34.339
WHEW!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.967
ROLL THE REST
OF THE CLIP!

19:37.050 --> 19:38.135
THAT'S A RELIEF!

19:38.218 --> 19:38.302
AAH!

19:41.638 --> 19:43.473
Both: AAH!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.853
ROLL THE REST
OF THE CLIP!

19:53.150 --> 19:56.153
{\an1}SEE? YOU WERE NEVER
IN ANY DANGER.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.362
{\an1}SEE?

19:57.446 --> 20:00.616
ROLL THE REST
OF THE CLIP!

20:00.699 --> 20:01.575
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

20:01.658 --> 20:02.492
WHY THIS ONE SECTION
OF TRACK

20:02.576 --> 20:04.119
{\an5}IS SEPARATE
FROM THE REST
OF THE TRACKS.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.122
{\an1}THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S ON QUICKSAND!

20:08.081 --> 20:10.626
Both: AAH!

20:10.709 --> 20:11.585
WOW, THAT WAS QUICK.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.046
OK, I THINK WE'VE
SEEN ENOUGH.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.716
AUDIENCE,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.927
DOES COSMO KEEP
HIS JOB?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.930
OR DO WE RIP
HIS WINGS OFF

20:23.013 --> 20:25.140
AND SEND HIM HOME
TO HIS MAMA?

20:33.106 --> 20:33.357
STOP!

20:36.777 --> 20:37.986
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

20:38.070 --> 20:38.987
{\an1}YOU CAN'T TAKE
COSMO AWAY FROM ME

20:39.071 --> 20:41.531
WITHOUT SEEING <i> MY</i> CLIPS.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.158
{\an1}Timmy: WANDA, I WISH
I HAD SOME CLIPS--

20:43.241 --> 20:45.494
CLIPS THAT SHOW WHAT A GREAT JOB

20:45.577 --> 20:47.454
COSMO DOES
AS MY FAIRY GODPARENT.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.877
YOU WANTED A BIG
GLASS OF CIDER?

20:53.961 --> 20:54.711
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
A HUNGRY SPIDER.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.838
AAH!

21:01.259 --> 21:02.344
LAWN MOWER?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.346

THINGS GET FOR ME--

21:18.151 --> 21:19.903
{\an1}OR ME!

21:18.151 --> 21:19.903
WHATEVER!

21:19.987 --> 21:21.905
I CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON COSMO

21:21.989 --> 21:24.574
TO BE THERE FOR ME
AND CHEER ME UP.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.909
HE'S NOT JUST
MY FAIRY GODPARENT.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.245
I'M HIS GODKID,

21:28.328 --> 21:29.538
AND I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE HIM

21:29.621 --> 21:32.040
ANY MORE
THAN WANDA DOES!

WITH TIMMY

21:36.878 --> 21:39.464
{\an1}OR GO HOME
WITH HIS MOMMY?

21:45.512 --> 21:46.430
{\an1}OH, NO.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.390
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE
HIM BACK TO HIS MAMA.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.267
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

21:51.685 --> 21:53.812
{\an1}HEY, BEFORE YOU PUSH
THAT BUTTON,

21:53.895 --> 21:55.439
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:55.522 --> 21:59.151
{\an1}DO YOU REALLY WANT HIM
BACK HERE IN FAIRY WORLD?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.155
All: AAH!

22:11.163 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}Billy:
AND IN A LANDSLIDE VICTORY,

22:12.998 --> 22:13.832
IT LOOKS LIKE

22:13.915 --> 22:17.044
{\an1}COSMO GETS TO STAY
WITH HIS FAIRY GODCHILD!

22:17.127 --> 22:20.714
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

22:20.797 --> 22:22.841
All: YAY!

22:22.924 --> 22:24.426
I CAN'T BELIEVE

22:24.509 --> 22:26.178
{\an4}AFTER ALL THOSE
HEART-RENDING,
TEAR-JERKING MOMENTS,

22:26.261 --> 22:27.888
{\an1}YOU STILL VOTED TO TAKE
COSMO AWAY FROM ME.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.848
OH, NO.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.349
{\an5}AFTER SEEING HOW
COSMO TORTURED
WANDA,

22:31.433 --> 22:35.187
{\an5}I ACTUALLY VOTED
TO LET HIM STAY
WITH YOU.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.271
{\an1}THEN WHO WAS
THE ONE PERSON

22:36.354 --> 22:38.398
{\an1}WHO VOTED
TO SEND HIM HOME?

22:38.482 --> 22:38.565
[WHISTLING]

22:41.026 --> 22:43.904
WHAT?! I DIDN'T DO IT.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.447
{\an1}I'M JUST PRACTICING
MY WHISTLING.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.365
Cosmo: HEY!

22:46.448 --> 22:48.408
I KEEP PRESSING
THE GO HOME BUTTON,

22:48.492 --> 22:48.658
BUT WE'RE STILL HERE.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.497
I WISH WE COULD
JUST GO HOME.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.623
YOU'VE GOT IT, TIMMY!

22:54.706 --> 22:56.541
