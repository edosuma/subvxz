00:55.580 --> 00:57.172
OK, Take it easy.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.733
See you.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.168
Turn it down!

01:38.580 --> 01:39.729
I'm serious.

01:39.860 --> 01:42.215
No way! I don't believe it.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.857
No way. You're such a liar.
I can't believe you.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.936
Oh, no. Look behind us.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.653
That one's for you.
He's a live one.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.578
He's yours. Here's my stop.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.216
Hey, driver!

02:31.340 --> 02:32.614
Hey!

02:32.740 --> 02:34.731
Hey, driver, that was my stop.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.573
Driver, that was my stop!

02:49.260 --> 02:50.409
Driver, what's going on?

02:50.540 --> 02:51.734
Where are we going?

02:55.540 --> 02:56.814
- Driver!
- Where are you going?

02:57.540 --> 02:58.939
Stop it!

03:09.180 --> 03:10.659
Stop!

03:34.780 --> 03:36.179
Please. Please, stop.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.098
What... what is he?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.539
I think he's dead.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.729
Oh, no!

03:47.620 --> 03:48.575
Oh, my God!

03:52.780 --> 03:54.099
What's happening?

04:02.580 --> 04:04.377
Oh, my God. We're dead.

04:23.140 --> 04:25.256
Oh, my God! What is it?

04:42.260 --> 04:43.579
What's that?

04:44.580 --> 04:45.899
Oh, my God!

04:46.020 --> 04:48.250
Oh, my God! Help me!

05:01.620 --> 05:04.339
Look out, he's coming!
He's coming!

05:11.420 --> 05:13.092
We've got to keep balanced!

05:41.540 --> 05:44.771
Mommy, why can't Jesse wake up
like everybody else?

05:44.900 --> 05:46.697
Oh, honey, he's all right.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.697
He's just having a bad dream.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.777
Mmm. Thank you.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.129
Morning, honey.

06:28.260 --> 06:29.409
Hi, Mom.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.735
Well, two more. Hallelujah.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.291
I want that room unpacked
by tonight, young man.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.853
O K, Dad. I promise.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.130
I don't want
any more promises, Jesse.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.898
I want that room cleaned up, O K?

06:41.020 --> 06:42.612
All right. I'll g et on it.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.255
Angie, what are you up to?

06:47.380 --> 06:49.177
I'm trying to g et
the Fu Man Fingers.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.336
Want some eggs?

06:51.460 --> 06:53.178
Jesse, are you O K?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.655
It's just so hot up there.
I'm having trouble sleeping.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.815
I know.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.976
I wish you'd have
the air conditioning...

06:59.100 --> 07:02.137
There's nothing
wrong with it, Mom.

07:02.260 --> 07:03.329
It just needs a shot of Freon.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.370
Here they are.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.371
Dad, you're not trying to fix
something again.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.296
Nobody likes a smart ass,
buddy-boy.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.455
Look.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.489
Who is that?

07:18.620 --> 07:19.735
It's Lisa.

07:19.860 --> 07:21.088
I've got to get to school.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.448
Whoa. Who's Lisa?

07:24.660 --> 07:25.729
Who is Lisa?

07:26.500 --> 07:27.933
Just eat your eggs, dear.

07:41.540 --> 07:42.973
Don't you use a key?

07:43.100 --> 07:44.852
Why?

07:44.980 --> 07:46.459
Somebody could steal your car,
couldn't they?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.779
The deadly dinosaur?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.216
Grady, come on. You can hit it!

08:14.620 --> 08:16.417
Let's go, Grady!

08:16.540 --> 08:17.495
Ready, girls?

08:26.020 --> 08:27.339
Strike!

08:28.100 --> 08:30.455
It didn't feel right.
Give me a break.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.217
So, you getting any yet, Lise?

08:32.340 --> 08:34.570
Kerry,
he's my ride to school, O K?

08:46.060 --> 08:47.254
Are you all right?

08:48.340 --> 08:50.058
You O K?

08:54.460 --> 08:55.575
You O K?

08:55.700 --> 08:57.019
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.415
Well, pay attention next time.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.609
Very heads-up play.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.774
N ice catch, Walsh.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.253
Come on, come on! Let's go!

09:20.300 --> 09:21.619
You're out!

09:21.740 --> 09:23.378
Heads-up play, Grady.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.819
All right!

09:26.260 --> 09:27.329
N ice ass.

09:28.340 --> 09:29.853
Nail him!

09:30.860 --> 09:32.179
H it him!

09:32.300 --> 09:33.335
Come on, slug him!

09:38.820 --> 09:40.412
Here comes Schneider. Watch out.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.690
Get out of my way.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.928
Move it!

09:45.060 --> 09:46.573
O K, dirtballs...

09:48.060 --> 09:49.334
assume the position!

09:58.660 --> 09:59.888
See you around, coach.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.655
How much longer do you think
he'll keep us out here?

10:17.780 --> 10:18.974
It could be all night.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.250
He gets his rocks off like this.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.450
Hangs around
queer S and M joints downtown.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.137
He likes pretty boys like you.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.375
Get out of here.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.212
So what about
you and that rich babe...

10:34.340 --> 10:35.693
you've been cruising to school
with every day?

10:35.820 --> 10:36.775
What about her?

10:36.900 --> 10:39.095
Are you mounting her nightly
or what?

10:39.220 --> 10:41.097
Look, Grady,
you got some problem with me?

10:42.140 --> 10:44.256
No, bro. Just killing time.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.175
O K, dirtballs, hit the shower!

10:56.420 --> 10:57.899
So you live around here or what?

10:58.020 --> 11:00.136
Yeah. My parents bought a place
on Elm Street.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.136
Elm Street?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.330
You telling me you moved
into that big white house...

11:03.460 --> 11:04.939
with bars on the window?

11:05.060 --> 11:06.209
Yeah. What about it?

11:06.340 --> 11:09.059
Shit. Tell your old man
he's a real chump.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.772
What are you talking about now?

11:11.620 --> 11:14.134
Some chick was locked in there
by her mother and went crazy.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.933
She watched her boyfriend g et
butchered across the street...

11:17.060 --> 11:18.539
by some maniac.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.933
You're full of shit, Grady.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.815
Shit.

14:09.860 --> 14:11.259
Help!

14:13.700 --> 14:15.338
Daddy can't help you now!

14:24.660 --> 14:27.379
I need you, Jesse.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.015
We got special work to do here,
you and me.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.052
You've got the body...

14:38.980 --> 14:40.811
I've got the brain.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.093
You think
we should call a doctor?

15:01.380 --> 15:02.938
No, I'm fine.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.733
It's just a bad dream, O K?

15:08.260 --> 15:09.932
Yeah. Go to sleep.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.928
So...

15:15.540 --> 15:16.939
to review...

15:17.060 --> 15:18.379
the solid waste...

15:18.500 --> 15:21.412
those nutrients not absorbed
in the lining of the stomach...

15:21.540 --> 15:22.939
the large intestine...

15:23.060 --> 15:25.415
the small intestine,
and the alimentary canal...

15:25.540 --> 15:27.178
are passed out
through the colon.

15:30.740 --> 15:32.219
Liquid nutrients
are then carried...

15:32.340 --> 15:34.137
through an elaborate system
of filtering...

15:34.260 --> 15:37.218
aided by the pancreas,
liver, and gall bladder...

15:38.140 --> 15:41.416
or collected in the bladder
to be expelled at a later time.

15:42.980 --> 15:45.255
And this entire process
is kept moving...

15:45.380 --> 15:47.291
through
the circulatory system...

15:47.420 --> 15:49.092
the centre of which is...

15:51.900 --> 15:53.652
the heart.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.217
Four chambers... just like
the human heart, really.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.219
From the body...

16:03.340 --> 16:04.568
to the right auricle...

16:04.700 --> 16:05.769
to the right ventricle...

16:05.900 --> 16:08.130
and out the pulmonary
arteries to the lungs.

16:08.260 --> 16:12.094
There it trades off
carbon dioxide for oxygen.

16:12.220 --> 16:14.415
Carbon dioxide is exhaled...

16:14.540 --> 16:18.658
and oxygenated blood continues
passing through the veins...

16:18.780 --> 16:20.975
into the left auricle...

16:21.100 --> 16:23.455
through the left ventricle,
passing out again.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.454
If you want to play
with animals, M r Walsh...

16:56.580 --> 16:58.377
join the circus.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.611
Lisa, sweetheart!

17:18.740 --> 17:20.332
There's a Jesse on the phone.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.655
OK. Thanks, Mom.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.289
Where are you going, Jess?

17:40.420 --> 17:41.773
Just out for a little while.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.414
I told you
I want that room unpacked.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.576
Dad, it's just for a few hours.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.099
No. Upstairs.

17:48.220 --> 17:49.778
Right now, son.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.969
Right now.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.178
How do you like that, Dad?

19:17.660 --> 19:20.254
I'll leave the two of you alone.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.449
Excuse me.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.971
I told her you invited me over.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.532
I guess maybe
I should've called.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.535
It's fine, really.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.855
I mean,
I was just cleaning my room.

19:36.980 --> 19:38.652
I know.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.692
I figured
you might like some help.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.132
Where does this go?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.209
Do sweaters go in the closet?

20:08.300 --> 20:09.699
What's this?

20:09.820 --> 20:11.617
I don't know.
Looks like a diary to me.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.852
"Nancy Thompson,
1428 Elm Street."

20:21.980 --> 20:23.095
That's right here.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.616
You know this is five years old?

20:27.740 --> 20:29.059
You know her?

20:29.180 --> 20:31.375
No. Before my time.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.049
Wait. Listen to this.

20:35.180 --> 20:37.569
"Sometimes
when I'm lying here in bed...

20:37.700 --> 20:39.850
I see Glenn in his window
across the way...

20:39.980 --> 20:41.777
getting ready for bed.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.697
H is body is slim and smooth.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.811
I know I shouldn't watch him...

20:45.940 --> 20:48.135
but that part of me
that wants him...

20:48.260 --> 20:49.739
forces me to.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.059
That's when I weaken.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.091
That's when
I want to go to him."

20:56.780 --> 20:57.815
Can I see that?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.569
"March Fifteenth.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.179
He comes to me at night...

21:05.300 --> 21:08.178
horrible, ugly, and dirty...

21:08.300 --> 21:09.733
under the sheets with me...

21:09.860 --> 21:13.250
tearing at my nightgown
with his steel claws.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.731
H is name is Fred...

21:18.860 --> 21:20.896
and he keeps trying to take me
to the boiler room.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.538
He wants to kill me."

21:30.380 --> 21:31.893
What is it?

21:35.620 --> 21:37.019
"Tina is dead"?

21:41.420 --> 21:42.773
Jesse, are you O K?

21:44.780 --> 21:47.931
It's just something
that Grady said to me...

21:48.060 --> 21:50.130
about the girl
that used to live here.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.613
How she went crazy...

21:51.740 --> 21:54.459
when she saw her boyfriend
g et murdered across the street.

24:38.780 --> 24:39.895
Go ahead, Jesse.

24:40.860 --> 24:41.895
Try it on for size.

24:51.020 --> 24:51.975
Kill for me.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.256
It was
like I was sleepwalking.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.331
Maybe you were having
a premonition or something...

25:16.460 --> 25:18.735
like the guys
who help police solve crimes...

25:18.860 --> 25:20.737
and find missing people.

25:20.860 --> 25:22.691
You ever have anything like this
happen before?

25:22.820 --> 25:23.855
No, never.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.572
You think that's what it is?

25:25.700 --> 25:27.258
I don't know.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.450
Can I see the diary
for a little while?

25:30.620 --> 25:31.769
Thanks.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.016
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Kerry.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.938
I got your invitation
for the party this weekend.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.459
Any cute guys gonna be there?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.377
All of them.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.298
Is your dad
gonna be the D.J. Again?

25:43.420 --> 25:45.297
Mom's gonna try to keep him
upstairs this time.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.092
Oh, good.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.573
Last party I had...

25:48.700 --> 25:52.409
my dad insisted on playing
Benny Goodman all night.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.697
I'll see you later, O K?

26:08.460 --> 26:11.099
Hey, Grady,
do you remember your dreams?

26:11.220 --> 26:12.699
Only the wet ones.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.458
No talking!

26:21.060 --> 26:24.052
Schneider shouldn't have called
you out on that last play.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.530
Schneider's
got a stick up his ass today.

26:27.660 --> 26:30.652
Schneider's
always got a stick up his ass.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.577
Hello, dirtballs.

26:55.220 --> 26:58.530
Oh, it is so hot in here!

27:00.220 --> 27:02.097
Let me look at the thermostat.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.294
My God,
it is hot as an oven in here.

27:13.420 --> 27:16.492
Shh! The birds are sleeping.

27:17.740 --> 27:20.538
Cheryl, it's
ninety-seven degrees in here.

27:39.460 --> 27:40.654
Damn it!

27:41.820 --> 27:43.378
Angela, watch out!

27:45.940 --> 27:47.089
Watch out, Jesse!

27:49.940 --> 27:51.498
Ken, are you all right?

27:51.620 --> 27:52.609
Damn bird!

27:52.740 --> 27:54.537
Look out, Angela! Get down!

27:59.180 --> 28:01.250
Look out, Angela!

28:03.820 --> 28:05.572
Jesse, g et out of here!

28:29.940 --> 28:31.532
What are you doing, Jesse?
Help me move this.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.218
It isn't the gas.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.659
Don't tell me it's not the gas.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.657
Your mother thought
she smelled gas.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.498
Ken, I thought I did.
I wasn't sure.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.497
Then what is it? Bird rabies?

28:40.620 --> 28:42.099
It's that cheap seed
you've been buying.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.858
Please, Ken, really...

28:43.980 --> 28:45.698
There's gotta be
a rational explanation.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.936
Animals don't just explode
into flames for no reason.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.049
That's right.

28:49.180 --> 28:50.249
All right.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.859
It's sure not a leaky gas pipe.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.410
- You all right?
- Oh, it's all right.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.735
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

29:00.220 --> 29:01.209
What are you talking about?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.058
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.375
What did you use, firecrackers?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.218
He used a goddam cherry bomb.

29:07.340 --> 29:08.375
- Oh, stop.
- That's what he did.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.172
You can't talk to me like that.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.574
Jesse, come back here.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.179
Come back here, Jesse!

29:13.300 --> 29:14.619
Ken, stop it!
You're being ridiculous!

29:14.740 --> 29:16.014
Stop it!

29:28.180 --> 29:29.579
Shit.

30:32.380 --> 30:36.771
Jesus, I don't know.
He does the strangest things.

31:09.420 --> 31:10.899
Can I have a beer, please?

32:06.180 --> 32:07.499
H it the shower.

34:23.219 --> 34:25.016
No, God damn it!

35:44.140 --> 35:45.459
Oh, boy.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.656
Good evening.
Does this belong to you?

35:49.780 --> 35:51.850
Yes, sir. He's my son.

35:51.980 --> 35:54.175
We found him on the highway
wandering around.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.131
He was naked.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.860
I'd keep a short leash on him
if I were you.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.969
Thank you.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.374
Jesse, come in. Come in.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.049
Come here.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.498
Two questions...

36:12.740 --> 36:15.095
you answer them,
and we can all go to bed.

36:19.900 --> 36:21.253
What are you taking, son?

36:22.420 --> 36:23.739
Who are you getting it from?

36:26.100 --> 36:28.216
I'm not taking drugs.

36:30.260 --> 36:31.375
Mom, I want to go to bed.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.615
Yeah, come on.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.178
It's a problem
I have to work out on my own.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.972
I know,
but something's bothering you.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.852
I'm concerned about you. Jesse!

36:50.980 --> 36:53.813
I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.329
Can't we at least talk about it?

37:07.340 --> 37:08.489
He needs professional help.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.690
We have to take him to see
a psychiatrist.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.175
Are you out of your gourd?
What the hell will that do?

37:13.300 --> 37:16.212
I don't know. He needs help
we can't give to him.

37:16.340 --> 37:17.659
Oh, come on.

37:17.780 --> 37:20.214
Are you hearing me?
That boy's in trouble!

37:20.340 --> 37:21.932
No, he's not in trouble!

37:22.060 --> 37:24.528
What that boy needs
is a goddam kick in the butt.

37:24.660 --> 37:25.570
That's what he needs!

37:27.540 --> 37:30.008
Tell you what he needs.
He needs a methadone clinic.

37:47.820 --> 37:48.889
What's happening?

37:50.380 --> 37:52.336
I want all you students
to step back here.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.774
Don't worry.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.333
Let them do their work,
all right?

38:00.460 --> 38:01.939
Yo, man, where have you been?

38:02.060 --> 38:03.539
Schneider got wasted last night.

38:03.660 --> 38:05.139
He must've been working late.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.057
Some maniac sliced him up
like a kielbasa...

38:07.180 --> 38:08.169
hacked him in the shower.

38:08.300 --> 38:10.097
Got bloody footprints
all over the place.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.334
Kill for me.

39:11.980 --> 39:15.052
One, two

39:15.180 --> 39:19.571
Freddy's coming for you

39:20.300 --> 39:22.416
Three

39:22.540 --> 39:24.019
Four

39:24.140 --> 39:29.168
Better lock your door

39:30.180 --> 39:32.011
Five

39:32.140 --> 39:33.289
Six

39:33.420 --> 39:37.618
Grab your crucifix

39:41.980 --> 39:43.254
Morning, Jess.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.415
Morning.

39:55.140 --> 39:57.290
How come it took them five years
to sell this house?

39:57.420 --> 40:00.093
Oh, I don't know.
Couldn't g et the right price.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.575
You didn't know about the murder
across the street...

40:02.700 --> 40:03.849
and the crazy girl
that lived here...

40:03.980 --> 40:05.299
that saw the whole thing?

40:05.420 --> 40:07.217
They told me something about it.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.570
You knew something
about this, and...

40:09.700 --> 40:12.737
How do you think
we got such a good deal?

40:13.740 --> 40:16.618
Did they tell you
that that girl lost her mind...

40:16.740 --> 40:18.856
and her mother killed herself
in our living room?

40:18.980 --> 40:20.698
- What?
- Did they tell you that?

40:20.820 --> 40:22.936
Mom, I'm scared.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.049
Come here.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.329
Oh, honey, it's all right.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.815
Daddy and Jesse
are just pretending.

40:27.940 --> 40:29.578
We shouldn't discuss this here.

40:29.700 --> 40:30.769
See what you're doing?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.333
I don't want to hear
one more word about it.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.577
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with this house.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.769
Come on.

40:37.740 --> 40:39.014
Is something burning?

40:42.980 --> 40:44.049
Good Lord!

40:53.900 --> 40:56.368
That's the craziest damn thing
I've ever seen.

40:57.860 --> 40:58.929
Look here, Cheryl.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.408
It wasn't even plugged in.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.734
Jesse, you can't blame yourself
for what happened to Schneider.

41:09.860 --> 41:11.737
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't mean you did it.

41:11.860 --> 41:12.849
Where are we going?

41:12.980 --> 41:14.049
Bear left over here.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.939
I really think
this is all in your mind.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.449
You're picking up
some psychic signals.

41:46.700 --> 41:47.849
What is this place?

41:50.420 --> 41:51.819
Do you remember in the diary...

41:51.940 --> 41:54.170
when Nancy said she kept finding
herself in a boiler room?

41:54.300 --> 41:56.530
Fred Krueger worked here.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.059
It's an old power plant.

42:00.540 --> 42:01.575
Here.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.569
What is all this?

42:03.700 --> 42:06.419
I did some reading
on our friend Fred Krueger.

42:24.460 --> 42:25.893
How long has it been
closed down?

42:26.020 --> 42:27.658
A long time. Come on.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.816
Fred Krueger
kidnapped twenty kids...

42:34.940 --> 42:36.498
and brought them here...

42:36.620 --> 42:37.894
and killed them.

42:46.100 --> 42:47.169
Do you feel anything?

42:48.180 --> 42:49.169
What do you mean?

42:49.300 --> 42:52.212
I thought you might be able to
make a connection or something.

43:00.980 --> 43:02.299
I feel like a jerk.

43:02.420 --> 43:03.978
Shh. Just concentrate.

43:12.820 --> 43:14.458
Do you feel anything?

44:40.060 --> 44:42.494
Wake up, little girl.

44:46.700 --> 44:48.179
What time is it?

44:53.900 --> 44:55.015
It's late.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.898
Go back to sleep.

45:22.780 --> 45:24.338
Morning, honey.

45:24.460 --> 45:25.529
Did you sleep O K?

45:26.500 --> 45:28.218
Yeah, fine.

45:28.340 --> 45:29.329
Good.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.688
You're looking better.

45:41.460 --> 45:43.212
You had another nightmare,
didn't you?

45:44.140 --> 45:46.131
Yes, I had a bad night.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.659
Do you want to talk about it?

45:49.780 --> 45:51.816
My dad thinks I'm on drugs.

45:51.940 --> 45:53.259
My mom thinks I'm crazy.

45:53.380 --> 45:54.369
And you know, at this point...

45:54.500 --> 45:56.138
I don't know
if I don't agree with her.

46:00.180 --> 46:02.569
What's wrong with Jesse?
He seems kind of freaked out.

46:07.460 --> 46:09.610
You want to go get a movie
or something, hang out?

46:09.740 --> 46:12.459
Maybe g et things off your mind,
g et a pizza or something?

46:12.580 --> 46:13.615
Hey, guys.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.169
Hi, Ronnie.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.299
You going to Lisa's house
tomorrow night?

46:20.420 --> 46:22.251
Nope. Can't. I'm grounded.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.052
How come?

46:24.180 --> 46:26.489
I threw my grandmother
down a flight of stairs.

46:29.500 --> 46:31.138
Jesse, I think
you should eat something.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.295
I'm not hungry.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.376
I wish you would talk to me.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.649
We can figure it out.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.498
We can figure it out tog ether.

46:37.620 --> 46:39.497
There is nothing to figure out.

46:40.540 --> 46:41.655
I don't know
why you're wasting your time.

46:41.780 --> 46:44.453
- He's a basket case.
- Shut up, Grady!

46:46.580 --> 46:47.899
You want me to shut up?

46:48.020 --> 46:50.215
Fine! I'll shut up. No problem.

46:51.060 --> 46:52.288
See you around, buddy.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.779
Medium rare.

47:27.140 --> 47:28.812
Hey! Cut that out.

47:29.820 --> 47:30.889
I've got it.

47:32.900 --> 47:35.494
Sweetheart, it's a nice party.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.611
Come on, skinny.
It's time for bed.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.453
You're in charge, hot shot.

47:44.220 --> 47:46.973
Twelve-thirty, miss. No later.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.011
- Twelve-thirty.
- Have a nice time.

47:58.460 --> 47:59.973
What's the matter with Jesse?

48:00.860 --> 48:01.929
I don't know.

48:10.860 --> 48:11.929
I'll be out in a second.

48:12.060 --> 48:14.415
Can I please come in
and talk to you?

48:28.380 --> 48:30.848
Listen, I'm going to leave.
I'm not into this.

48:32.340 --> 48:33.489
I'm sorry.

48:34.540 --> 48:36.656
Jesse, why won't you talk to me?

48:39.660 --> 48:42.015
- Will you just leave me alone?
- You're not being fair.

48:43.260 --> 48:44.488
I want to help you.

48:45.820 --> 48:47.014
How can you help me?

48:48.500 --> 48:49.979
What are you gonna do for me?

48:50.100 --> 48:53.809
Look, I feel like
I'm losing my mind...

48:53.940 --> 48:56.534
and I don't want you to watch me
fall apart.

48:57.740 --> 49:00.174
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

49:01.380 --> 49:02.938
I'm afraid to stay awake.

49:03.060 --> 49:05.449
I'm ruining your party.

49:05.580 --> 49:06.774
They're gonna take me away.

49:06.900 --> 49:08.652
Come on. Don't say that.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.975
Listen, we'll stay up all night
if we have to.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.614
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

49:48.580 --> 49:50.616
Any second now. Any second now.

50:05.700 --> 50:06.769
Party time!

50:07.900 --> 50:09.777
I got the music!

50:26.060 --> 50:27.573
What the hell
are they doing down there?

50:27.700 --> 50:28.849
Oh, Eddie, they're kids.

50:28.980 --> 50:32.097
I know they're kids,
but I got to get some rest.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.379
What is it?

51:26.500 --> 51:27.933
Jesse, what's wrong?

51:43.900 --> 51:45.333
Jesus Christ!

51:45.460 --> 51:47.098
You scared
the shit out of me, man.

51:47.860 --> 51:49.816
Hey, what are you doing?

51:53.420 --> 51:55.809
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing in my room?

51:56.940 --> 51:57.770
Listen...

51:58.060 --> 51:59.288
I'm in trouble.

52:00.340 --> 52:01.932
I need you to let me
stay here tonight.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.618
Are you out of your mind?

52:04.540 --> 52:05.939
I don't know.

52:07.180 --> 52:08.249
Oh, man.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.255
Why don't you just go home and
take a bottle of sleeping pills?

52:16.900 --> 52:18.777
I killed Schneider.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.050
You what?

52:21.180 --> 52:23.330
Only it wasn't me, see?

52:23.460 --> 52:25.178
There's something inside of me.

52:25.300 --> 52:28.019
And last night it made me go
to my sister's room.

52:28.140 --> 52:29.937
And tonight,
with Lisa in the cabana...

52:30.060 --> 52:32.016
it started to happen again.

52:32.140 --> 52:34.734
I think you are seriously
losing it, bro.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.578
I'm scared, Grady.

52:38.220 --> 52:40.575
Something is trying
to g et inside my body.

52:40.700 --> 52:42.895
She's female and waiting for
you in the cabana.

52:43.020 --> 52:44.294
And you wanna sleep with me.

52:44.420 --> 52:47.651
Look, I don't care
if you believe me or not!

52:47.780 --> 52:49.133
Hey! I believe you!

52:49.260 --> 52:51.410
You've had
some scary dreams, O K?

52:57.860 --> 53:00.579
I don't... know.

53:02.100 --> 53:03.453
I'm all messed up.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.333
What difference does it make?

53:07.500 --> 53:08.979
I'm in trouble...

53:09.100 --> 53:10.977
and I need you to help me.

53:27.580 --> 53:29.332
All right, man.
What do you want me to do?

53:34.740 --> 53:35.934
Just watch me.

53:37.740 --> 53:39.776
If anything starts to happen...

53:40.780 --> 53:42.418
if I start to act weird...

53:42.540 --> 53:44.292
or start dreaming weird...

53:44.420 --> 53:46.012
or try to walk out of here...

53:46.140 --> 53:47.493
you gotta stop me.

53:47.620 --> 53:49.497
I don't care if you have
to hit me over the head...

53:49.620 --> 53:51.338
just don't let me leave.

53:51.460 --> 53:52.973
And, Grady...

53:54.420 --> 53:55.978
don't fall asleep.

53:58.460 --> 53:59.495
Hot dog?

54:03.700 --> 54:04.928
Come back in the water.

54:05.740 --> 54:07.093
I'm busy, O K?

54:10.260 --> 54:12.057
I don't know.
I feel I should go see him...

54:12.180 --> 54:14.296
but I can't
just leave the party.

54:14.420 --> 54:16.456
Fuck the party.

54:17.620 --> 54:19.019
Go see him.

54:27.740 --> 54:29.731
The land of the dead...

54:29.860 --> 54:31.532
I want youse to meet Lou...

54:31.660 --> 54:34.618
And now I see the...

54:34.740 --> 54:35.729
Gee, kid, you're a doll.

54:35.860 --> 54:37.009
You sure handled
that situation...

54:39.300 --> 54:41.894
Was he alive? That funnels
into a bottomless pit!

54:51.180 --> 54:52.533
Sweet dreams, pal.

55:10.740 --> 55:11.809
What?

55:13.580 --> 55:15.457
It's starting to happen again.

55:24.340 --> 55:25.329
Jesus.

55:26.340 --> 55:27.250
Hey, man.

55:30.220 --> 55:31.972
What the fuck's
wrong with you, dude?

55:45.100 --> 55:46.453
Shit.

56:08.340 --> 56:09.853
Dad, open the door!

56:42.940 --> 56:43.850
Oh, my God!

56:45.420 --> 56:47.058
Dad, open this door!

57:04.420 --> 57:05.489
What is it?

57:09.780 --> 57:11.213
Ron, open the door!

57:11.340 --> 57:13.456
Ron, are you all right?

57:16.940 --> 57:19.135
Ron, it's your father!
Open this door!

57:28.260 --> 57:29.375
Open it up!

57:36.380 --> 57:37.779
Get help!

58:12.860 --> 58:15.215
You son of a bitch!

58:16.220 --> 58:18.495
You killed him!

58:35.300 --> 58:36.892
Is somebody in there? Open up.

58:37.780 --> 58:39.975
Break it down. Come on.

58:42.780 --> 58:43.849
Hit it again.

58:45.460 --> 58:46.609
Again.

59:09.660 --> 59:11.378
Jesse! My God. What happened?

59:11.500 --> 59:14.333
I killed him. I killed him.

59:17.420 --> 59:19.934
Jesse, my God. You're hurt.
What happened?

59:20.060 --> 59:22.176
L... I killed Grady.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.531
Lisa, I killed Schneider.

59:29.820 --> 59:32.015
Oh, no. My God!

59:33.500 --> 59:34.979
I'm so scared!

59:35.100 --> 59:37.250
Jesse,
what are you talking about?

59:38.620 --> 59:39.689
He's inside me.

59:41.020 --> 59:42.009
I'm scared.

59:42.140 --> 59:43.539
Jesse, who is doing this to you?

59:43.660 --> 59:45.059
Fred Krueger!

59:46.540 --> 59:47.859
He's inside me...

59:47.980 --> 59:50.494
and he wants to take me again!

59:56.700 --> 59:59.009
This is not happening.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.779
It's got to be everything
you've taken in...

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.494
Schneider,
the diary, the glove...

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.655
only it's all mix ed up.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:09.853
Christ, what do I have to do
to make you understand me?

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.012
Last night, he made me
try to kill my sister.

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.773
I got blood on my hands.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.653
He owns me.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.780
Could somebody turn down
the heat in the pool?

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.738
What's going on?

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.088
Shit!

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.329
Yay, Rocky!

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.052
Our hero!

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.693
Come on. I just want you
to listen to this.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:20.290
It's something Nancy said
in the last page of her diary.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.489
Listen.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.611
"He is evil itself.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.413
I know now that I brought him
into my world.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.859
We all did.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.777
Gave him
all the energy he needed.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.495
Our screams
were all he needed."

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.140
Jesse, she wasn't crazy.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.613
All this really happened.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.537
You can fight him.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.651
Oh, God. He's coming back.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.849
Get out of here, Lisa!

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.129
Jesse, fight him!

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.454
I can't.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.574
Fight it, Jesse.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.492
You created him!
You can destroy him!

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.815
Lisa! Open this door!

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.613
He is living off of your fear.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.173
- Jesse, fight him.
- I can't!

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.369
Yes, you can!

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.449
Fight him!

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.458
You're not afraid of him.
He doesn't even exist!

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.935
Oh, my God!

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.859
He can't fight me.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.379
I'm him.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.769
It's getting too hot!

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.777
Get out!

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.538
Get me out!

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.692
Jesse, help.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.538
There is no Jesse!

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.139
I'm Jesse now!

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.013
Get away from me!

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.218
Kill me, Lisa.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.573
Please kill me.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.815
Come on, Lisa.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.373
Kill him!

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.455
I love you, Lisa.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.855
Oh, God.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.859
Oh, please.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.613
I love you, Lisa.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.450
Jesse, help!

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.650
Hey, is everybody O K?

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.896
Search me.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.658
What's going on?

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.099
Wait a minute! Wait!

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.449
Lisa, are you all right?

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.649
Mommy.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.657
Get her out of here!

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.769
All right!

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.651
Just calm down, all right?

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.899
Relax.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.053
It's going to be all right.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.259
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.859
Just tell us what you want,
all right?

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.897
I'm here to help you.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.454
Help yourself, fucker!

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.733
You are all my children now.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.779
- Daddy!
- Oh, shit!

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.658
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.658
Where'd he go?

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.778
Come to me, Lisa.

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.931
Jesse, I know you're in there.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.290
- Stop him!
- No. Jesse's dead.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.175
I love you, Jesse.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.376
Come back to me, Lisa.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.771
I am not afraid of you.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.537
He's in there...

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.651
and I want him back!

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.816
I'm going to take him
away from you...

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.096
and you are gonna go
straight back to hell...

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.539
you son of a bitch!

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.378
No. Jesse's dead!

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.418
Come back to me, Jesse.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.532
I love you.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.378
Come back to me.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.853
He's dead!

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.139
He can't hold you, Jesse.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:42.012
He's losing his grip.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.539
You can g et out.

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.810
He'll die with me.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.969
He'll die with both of us.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.258
It's great to have you
home again, Jess.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.699
I can't believe I'm going back.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.095
- I'm glad.
- Good.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.972
- Have a good day.
- OK.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.089
Thanks, Mom.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.658
What is so funny?

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.171
That was a really great party.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.619
Thanks, Lise.

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.014
Thanks a lot.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.289
I can't believe
it's actually all over.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.978
Let's not talk about it.

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.252
What is this?

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.213
Am I going crazy,
or is this bus going too fast?

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.693
It's going fine.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.048
No problem.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.336
This bus is going too fast.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:23.012
Lisa, it's starting to speed up.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.493
It's fine.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.609
Driver!

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.729
Driver, stop!

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.134
Jesse, just sit down.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.289
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.455
It's OK. It's all right.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.815
Jesse, it's OK.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.373
It's all over.
