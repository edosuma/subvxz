WEBVTT

00:08.480 --> 00:10.300
Enough already.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.450
Miley, honey.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.610
I know it's hard being around people in love.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.300
You're being so tragically alone and all but

00:17.340 --> 00:19.350
let's try not to be bitter, OK.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.990
I have no problem not having a boyfriend.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.120
Right, it's not like you're gonna turn into

00:24.120 --> 00:26.030
some old biddy who knits all day

00:26.030 --> 00:28.930
searching for ways to fill her empty social life.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.300
Hey, Christmas will be here before you know it

00:34.360 --> 00:36.540
and Uncle Earl has a thick neck.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.900
Keep your knees up, Wendy.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.600
Maybe when you're done you can knit yourself a guy.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.000
Keep it up and I'll knit your mouth shut.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.700
OK, alright!

00:47.770 --> 00:50.700
You know what would relief that tension? Love!

00:51.190 --> 00:53.950
I do not need a boyfriend.

00:54.300 --> 00:58.000
Ah, I'm on it. Yo! Single dudes, listen up.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.160
I got a perfectly good girl here

01:00.160 --> 01:02.700
good height-weight ratio not hard to look at,

01:02.700 --> 01:04.269
let's start the bidding at her.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.700
She's got a little temperament issue

01:09.750 --> 01:12.970
but I think the right guy could tame her.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.400
Miley, you're blowing the sales pitch.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.400
Look, I love that you guys care

01:20.440 --> 01:21.780
but could you care just a little bit less?

01:21.780 --> 01:23.240
I can get a boyfriend on my own.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.500
Well, you might wanna speed it up

01:26.510 --> 01:29.190
cause you're starting to look a little pathetic.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.900
Oh, I'm sorry he's your boyfriend now, may I?

01:31.910 --> 01:34.700
Oh, just not the face, I love that face.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.170
See, we went to the movies just like

01:41.170 --> 01:42.480
before you two were dating.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.720
I had a great time. I do not need a boyfriend to be happy.

01:44.990 --> 01:47.200
- Aha.  - Right.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.500
Why are there four place settings?

01:52.050 --> 01:55.200
Oh, come on! I told you guys to stop setting me up!

01:55.600 --> 01:57.800
Hey, I'm Tim. You must be Miley?

01:59.800 --> 02:03.200
Then again - a girl's gotta be open to new experiences.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.000
Well, hello, Tim.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.030
You get the limo out front.

02:18.550 --> 02:21.800
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

02:26.030 --> 02:29.600
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.660
Who would've thought that a girl like me

02:33.670 --> 02:39.000
Would double as a superstar?

02:40.180 --> 02:43.700
You get the best of both worlds.

02:44.270 --> 02:45.980
Chill it out, take it slow,

02:45.980 --> 02:47.400
then you rock out the show.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.000
You get the best of both worlds.

02:52.010 --> 02:54.840
Mix it all together and you know that

02:54.840 --> 02:57.250
It's the best of both worlds.

02:57.350 --> 03:01.040
Hannah Montana  S03E15  Once Twice Three Times Afraidy

03:02.040 --> 03:07.640
So argh, you went to camp with, with um

03:08.300 --> 03:09.800
Lilly

03:10.500 --> 03:11.510
Right, whatever.

03:13.310 --> 03:15.500
Yeah. Lilly was really one of my only friends there.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.900
I was kinda skinny and nerdy.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.300
Well. The years have certainly been kind to you.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.100
You have the cutest accent.

03:24.410 --> 03:29.000
Well fiddledeedee! I do believe I am a blushing.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.000
Oh, oh, let me help you with that.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.910
-Whoa.  -I know!

03:34.920 --> 03:39.710
Aha. OK, eyes on your own date, Lillypop!

03:39.720 --> 03:42.410
Oh, Olliepop, there's no reason to be jealous.

03:44.410 --> 03:46.500
I'm not jealous. I just...

03:47.840 --> 03:48.940
I just want to see if you guys

03:48.940 --> 03:51.520
take a look at the special board? It's right over there!

03:51.600 --> 03:54.100
Right over that region.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.380
Right over these mountains.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.300
Right here, if you are taking a look.

03:57.310 --> 04:00.100
So, what high school do you go to?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.400
Oh, well, I actually graduated early.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.030
I'll be at UCLA in the fall.

04:04.030 --> 04:04.890
Premed.

04:05.860 --> 04:06.870
You're welcome.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.900
Hey. I'll be your waitress - my name is Jenny.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.010
Are you OK?

04:13.800 --> 04:17.800
Yeah! It's just my ex-girlfriends' name was Jenny.

04:18.649 --> 04:22.079
And I haven't heard that name since the breakup.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.300
Breakup?!

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
I didn't know!

04:26.990 --> 04:31.380
Whoa! OK. Sorry. Just got... caught off guard there.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.700
Um... shall we order?

04:36.280 --> 04:39.100
So um... how is the Arctic Char dip?

04:33.430 --> 04:35.580
OK

04:39.100 --> 04:41.880
Arctic Char dip? That's Jenny's favorite!

04:45.540 --> 04:47.400
Would you argh... would you like some water?

04:47.910 --> 04:49.880
Jenny loved water!

04:50.850 --> 04:52.480
Oh, sweet niblets!

04:57.600 --> 05:01.240
Ah, balloons with your face on it? I like it.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.500
You know, always wanted to pop you one.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.100
Hey hey hey, those are for advertising.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.100
Well they certainly got my attention

05:13.040 --> 05:14.160
I mean look at you

05:14.770 --> 05:16.120
you are just so cute,

05:16.120 --> 05:20.080
I just want to hug you and squeeze you so tight!

05:22.630 --> 05:23.660
Oops!

05:24.400 --> 05:26.900
You just cost youself next Christmas bonus.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.000
I don't even get any Christmas bonus.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.900
Well you do now, and now you don't.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.130
Just pass them out along the beach,

05:34.140 --> 05:37.000
and try to look smarter than the balloon

05:37.300 --> 05:40.000
Fine, anything to get away from you.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.900
Jackson, what are you doing? Get back down here.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.700
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's my fault.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.650
Max, do something.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.800
Eh, grab the blanket.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.150
Hey, Jackson, while you're up there,

05:59.150 --> 06:00.950
yell "eat at Rico's!"

06:00.950 --> 06:05.950
-Rico?  -No no no, eat at Rico's.

06:06.850 --> 06:07.950
Ok, ok.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.350
A little more to the right,

06:11.160 --> 06:12.810
No no no no, back to the left,

06:13.400 --> 06:17.020
little more, little more, OK.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.620
Jackson, let go!

06:26.350 --> 06:27.800
Hey Traci, the limo just called,

06:27.800 --> 06:30.510
-we'll be in your place in fifteen.  -Super.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.990
-Hey, Miley, we have the best...  -Shhh.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.990
I'm on the phone with Traci.

06:33.990 --> 06:35.860
Oh. Excuse me, thanks.

06:36.820 --> 06:41.050
Hey Traci, it's Lola, just want to say hey and BTW,

06:41.100 --> 06:42.370
I hate your outfit.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.200
You can't see my outfit.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.340
Oh, did I say your outfit? I mean it's your face.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.540
-I'm hanging up!  -No, you're not.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.770
I love it when you take charge

06:52.770 --> 06:53.990
and cut people off in the middle.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.700
Hush, Oliver! We're here for a reason.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.800
Oh, yeah.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.290
First, ewgh!

07:00.360 --> 07:02.960
And second, if the reason is to set me up

07:02.960 --> 07:05.350
on another blind date, forget about it.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.890
We know and we're sorry. We made a mistake...

07:07.940 --> 07:10.480
-We never should've tried to pick a guy for you. -Exactly

07:10.500 --> 07:12.450
From now on, we're gonna let you choose for yourself.

07:12.450 --> 07:12.900
Thank you!

07:13.010 --> 07:15.300
That's why this time we bought pictures!

07:15.500 --> 07:16.800
Oh, no.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.370
Bachelor No.1, is a junior in North Lantrity Academy

07:21.380 --> 07:23.480
of varsity baseball player, who loves history...

07:23.490 --> 07:24.890
Lilly, stop.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.110
Bachelor No.2, also a junior,

07:28.110 --> 07:29.570
love snow boarding, playing the guitar.

07:29.590 --> 07:32.490
-I'm leaving  -Wait, Bachelor No.3.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.530
Oh, forget Oliver, she's gone.

07:35.140 --> 07:38.680
Wow, you cut me and the music off?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.540
Olliepop liky.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.900
-Hannah, kiss kiss.  -Traci.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.540
Who is this?

07:54.550 --> 07:58.140
Adam, my new beau? Isn't he fabu?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.680
I love the way you say fabu.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.990
I love the way you love the way I say fabu.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.180
Why do couples have to be so annoying.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.390
Fooled ya!

08:09.630 --> 08:11.340
Adam is not my boyfriend.

08:11.460 --> 08:15.030
He is an actor I hired to play my boyfriend.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.940
You hired a fake boyfriend?

08:16.990 --> 08:21.910
Well actually, I prefer the term, faux beau.

08:22.510 --> 08:24.700
And I know I'm gonna regret this

08:24.720 --> 08:27.740
but what did you need your faux beau fo?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.700
To get my clingy ex-boyfriend off my back

08:31.840 --> 08:35.760
once he gives up, Adam 'moves away'.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.049
But we keep up a long distance relationship,

08:38.049 --> 08:40.900
because we are so in love.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
Oh my gosh,Traci, that's genius,

08:43.549 --> 08:45.910
so is Adam available to fake date a friend of mine,

08:45.990 --> 08:47.330
who is single by choice,

08:47.330 --> 08:49.180
and wishes her friends would get off her back,

08:49.190 --> 08:50.680
cause she doesn't need a guy to complete her!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.900
She tells me everything.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.010
He's open! He's open!

09:03.060 --> 09:06.190
oh, man, I swear that guy has no hands.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.900
Yeah, sort of know how he feels.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.390
Little help here?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.610
Oh, sorry, man.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.830
Go, baby, go, go, go!

09:25.300 --> 09:28.210
-You're a big help, Max.  -Hey, man, I'm here for you.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.420
Hey-yo, buddio.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.310
I brought you a little something

09:35.410 --> 09:37.260
they wanted to add balloons,

09:37.260 --> 09:40.740
but I thought it was a bit too soon.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.340
Wow, Rico, thanks.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.850
But you know what would make me feel a lot better?

09:48.110 --> 09:50.470
If you put your face in front of my fist.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.030
You are upset, I understand.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.420
But I bet the nice zesty lemon bar

09:56.430 --> 09:58.780
and the movie about sky diving penguin

09:58.910 --> 10:02.180
would turn that frown upside down.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.520
So you actually think that a stupid cartoon and

10:05.520 --> 10:08.060
some lame lemon bars will make me forgive you?

10:08.090 --> 10:10.170
Thanks to you, for the next six weeks,

10:10.170 --> 10:12.060
I'm gonna need help just to pick my nose.

10:13.610 --> 10:14.800
Don't look at me dude.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.360
-Just go away!  -Ok

10:17.380 --> 10:19.580
Not you, you!

10:21.010 --> 10:23.740
But... leave the cart.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.190
Alright alright, I'm going.

10:26.460 --> 10:30.160
But before I do, I want you to know I feel terrible,

10:31.830 --> 10:35.000
I know this can't make up for it, but I hope it will help.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.260
I should just leave this right here.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.260
So you think you can just write a check

10:43.260 --> 10:45.360
and then everything is ok?

10:47.340 --> 10:49.580
I can not be bought, Mr.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.190
Not even for fifty thousand dollars?

10:58.670 --> 11:03.460
fifty thousand  @#$%^&  @#$%

11:08.570 --> 11:11.100
I was staring at that gorgeous face,

11:11.110 --> 11:12.560
trying to see how I was going to meet him,

11:12.570 --> 11:14.270
when the coffee lady yelled out:

11:14.490 --> 11:16.210
one double decaf soy, no foam,

11:16.210 --> 11:18.490
extra whipped latte with half the cinnamon.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.890
It was his, we both reached for it,

11:20.890 --> 11:24.180
but he said don't worry, I will wait.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.280
Oh!

11:25.480 --> 11:28.620
And then he offer to share his low fat apple crumble.

11:28.630 --> 11:31.670
Oh, apple crumble.

11:34.910 --> 11:37.150
I can't wait for you to meet him, you are gonna love him.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.410
Oh, Miley, we are so happy for you, aren't we, Olliepop?

11:41.500 --> 11:43.180
Is the low fat apple crumble

11:43.180 --> 11:45.710
as good as the regular apple crumble?

11:47.630 --> 11:50.470
It's him, I'm so excited.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.870
Oh! Our little girl's found love!

11:54.920 --> 11:56.160
Hi!

11:56.340 --> 11:58.860
Hey, yeah, I can't make it.

11:59.570 --> 12:01.260
Oh you!

12:02.290 --> 12:03.740
I will be right back.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.580
Hey, honey

12:06.990 --> 12:08.700
No show faux beau say what?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.040
I'm sorry, but this other friend of mine

12:12.040 --> 12:13.920
is still trying to shake her ex and well,

12:13.980 --> 12:15.000
she needs me tonight

12:15.120 --> 12:16.950
Oh, hang up already!

12:16.960 --> 12:18.150
Sorry, cupcake.

12:18.150 --> 12:21.340
I told you it's buttercup. Read your script!

12:21.380 --> 12:22.220
Look, Don't worry, alright?

12:22.230 --> 12:24.170
I sent my roomie, he knows what to do.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.670
Your roommate?

12:29.370 --> 12:31.480
-Excuse me, Miley?  -Aha?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
Hey, I'm Ralphie Barboochie.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.440
Your ah, boyfriend for the night.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.120
Oh, cheese in biscuits.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.160
Relax, toots, I got this covered.

12:42.170 --> 12:45.120
Hey, plus I got a few extra tricks up my sleeve,

12:45.160 --> 12:49.240
speaking of which, I believe this is your watch.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.880
Ha, you gotta love me, right?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.880
Unfortunately, I do. Come on.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.060
So we must have been at the coffee place

13:05.060 --> 13:06.730
for what like four hours.

13:07.540 --> 13:08.750
Which reminds me,

13:08.750 --> 13:11.590
do either of you happen to have the correct time?

13:11.590 --> 13:14.120
-Yeah.  -Oh, wait, of course you don't,

13:14.120 --> 13:17.030
'cause I got your watches, hahaha

13:17.040 --> 13:19.510
here you go, thank you, thank you. I'm just kidding.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.930
Come on, you gotta love me, right?

13:23.160 --> 13:25.370
Well I know I do.

13:27.490 --> 13:30.540
Oh, wow, Ralphie,

13:32.010 --> 13:36.830
-you are nothing like I've imagined.  -Not even close.

13:38.350 --> 13:42.510
He certainly is one of a kind. How did I get so lucky?

13:43.010 --> 13:45.360
Hey, I'm the lucky one here,

13:45.360 --> 13:46.900
Hey, as a matter of fact, I've just made up

13:46.900 --> 13:49.010
a love poem for you, you want to hear it?

13:49.070 --> 13:52.210
-Maybe we can do that...  -Roses are red, violets are blue,

13:52.290 --> 13:56.550
I got a hot girlfriend, and so do you my friend, pound it.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.440
Oh.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.510
See, I can pound the watch.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.100
Ah! Yeah, very clever,

14:05.110 --> 14:07.830
but I got your wallet. Hey, check, please.

14:09.460 --> 14:12.550
I don't know what I did to deserve him.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.710
I honestly don't.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.620
Alright, alright, hey hey,

14:22.590 --> 14:23.690
I was up all night,

14:23.690 --> 14:25.260
trying to figure out what kind of game you're playing,

14:25.320 --> 14:26.610
and I can't, so

14:27.540 --> 14:29.050
what kind of game are you playing?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.910
Yeah, what kind?

14:30.930 --> 14:34.720
There's no game, you got hurt because of me, I feel bad.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.330
Stop it, just stop it, you don't feel bad, you are Rico.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.190
Yeah, you are Rico.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.640
What? I'm helping

14:45.280 --> 14:47.070
And why would you give me more money

14:47.080 --> 14:48.740
than I would ever sue you for?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.200
Not really.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.900
Unless you're working on some kind of angle?

14:50.930 --> 14:52.370
Yeah, some... Sorry.

14:53.430 --> 14:54.650
Cause you're my friend.

14:54.670 --> 14:57.500
No, I'm not. Since the day I met you,

14:57.500 --> 14:58.660
all you've done is torture me.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.070
We had some fun, haven't we?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.020
Fun? You hate me!

15:05.160 --> 15:08.440
You honestly think I spend that much time on someone I hated?

15:08.940 --> 15:10.400
Jackson, face it,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.940
you're the closest thing of best friend I've got.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.680
How dumb do you think I am?

15:21.890 --> 15:23.190
I take this check to the bank,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.790
I get arrested for forgery,

15:24.890 --> 15:25.990
get sent to jail,

15:25.990 --> 15:28.190
and the last word I hear before I go over the river are

15:28.400 --> 15:30.640
Muahahahahah.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.170
Well what has two broken thumbs

15:33.170 --> 15:36.110
and ain't fallen for it? This guy!

15:38.620 --> 15:40.230
You know who I'm pointing at

15:41.570 --> 15:42.990
I'm gonna tear this thing up.

15:45.310 --> 15:46.560
Max tear this thing up.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.180
-But what if it's real?  -Oh it's real.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.910
-It's not real.  -It looks real.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.410
-Just rip it up.  -Fine.

15:54.490 --> 15:58.550
There, you'll never get the best of me, NEVER!

16:01.380 --> 16:04.190
-It was real wasn't it?  -Totally real, good as cash.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.110
Please! Let me bring him back, you can write him another.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.070
No, I can only be nice for so long.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.074

16:19.550 --> 16:22.600
You're late, Lilly and Olive gonna be here in any minute.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.770
What did you do to your hair?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.210
Hey, I spiffed up for you.

16:28.510 --> 16:30.930
Yeah, that would explain the catchup.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.700
Hey. So I stuffed a chilli dog on the way over,

16:34.700 --> 16:38.220
I can't be Mr wonderful without a little pooch in the pouch.

16:38.810 --> 16:40.850
I can't believe I'm paying for this

16:43.960 --> 16:45.310
Looks like you can afford it.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.980
Haho, nice place!

16:48.820 --> 16:52.210
Wow, is that one of those new wafer-thin computers

16:52.210 --> 16:54.260
that weighs less than a slice of lunch meat?

16:54.830 --> 16:57.400
I don't know, I don't weigh my lunch meat.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.190
Are you sure?

16:59.490 --> 17:00.670
cause this is two-hundred-dollar

17:00.670 --> 17:02.740
digital food scale begs to differ.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.450
Would you please focus?

17:05.470 --> 17:07.250
Lilly and Oliver are gonna be here,

17:07.250 --> 17:09.000
and I need to make sure you got the story...

17:10.030 --> 17:10.839
Mmh.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.400
I need to make sure you got the story straight,

17:13.450 --> 17:15.319
Your parents are moving away,

17:15.500 --> 17:17.310
but we are gonna keep a long distance relationship,

17:17.310 --> 17:18.569
because we are so in love.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.619
Yeah yeah yeah, I got it. I got it.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.650
Hi, guys.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.109
Miley what's the matter?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.990
Ralphie is moving away.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.870
What?

17:29.220 --> 17:31.260
His parents are going to England.

17:31.990 --> 17:36.430
Oh, wow, what a shame.

17:37.130 --> 17:41.600
Tell me about it, I don't even know how to speak 'englandish'.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.120
I'm gonna miss that sense of humor so much.

17:48.320 --> 17:54.170
Eh, you konw it's eh, whoo, it's gonna be ok

17:56.170 --> 17:59.570
Because my dermatologist has a son, he is so cute.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.070
You want to know why?

17:59.590 --> 18:02.760
and might get you a little discount on your stach bleaching.

18:03.870 --> 18:07.450
Thank you, but Ralphie and I are gonna make it work.

18:07.460 --> 18:10.000
We are just gonna have a long distance relationship.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.300
I mean good for you guys,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.390
that's gonna be great between you guys.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.390
Why?

18:18.530 --> 18:20.400
When you find somenthing as special as this,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.010
it's worth holding onto

18:22.010 --> 18:25.300
and not dating other people.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.040
It is worth holding onto.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.200
I don't want to say goodbye to you

18:30.780 --> 18:33.430
or my two new wonderful friends

18:33.920 --> 18:37.610
You know what? I'm not moving.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.880
I'm not giving up what we have without a fight,

18:38.080 --> 18:39.160
What?

18:41.930 --> 18:43.690
Look at you, you're a wreck.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.490
No, I'm not, see I'm really.

18:45.780 --> 18:47.420
Yeah, I will pull myself together.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.310
My mascara's not even running, see?

18:49.320 --> 18:50.710
I want you remember me like his, go,

18:50.710 --> 18:51.730
go now, go now, Ralphie.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.670
No, no, no, no, no way.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.920
I will go live with my grandma.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.270
-No, you won't!  -Sure I will!

18:58.070 --> 19:00.140
Would Romeo leave Juliet?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.500
Would Troy leave Gabriella?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.500
-Would you join me in the kitchen?  -OK

19:08.870 --> 19:11.530
I'm not sure I'm ready to give up this relationship.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.850
What are you doing?

19:11.930 --> 19:13.730
Please don't say you are falling in love with me.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.970
Ha, yeah, right

19:17.170 --> 19:18.550
The only thing I've fall in love

19:18.550 --> 19:20.860
with is this programmable coffee maker

19:20.860 --> 19:24.290
with built-in bean grinder and single cup convenience.

19:25.470 --> 19:26.610
You wouldn't!

19:26.620 --> 19:28.110
I bet you want me to go away.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.500
Fine.

19:33.610 --> 19:36.640
Well, as much as I would like to stay,

19:36.650 --> 19:38.460
my grandma just texted me that

19:38.460 --> 19:40.730
the condo didn't accept anyone under seventy five.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.090
so sadly, I must be going.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.840
But to remember me by

19:50.250 --> 19:52.110
please take our family coffee maker.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.900
Oh, no, no, no, stop, stop it,

19:56.900 --> 19:58.610
she's gonna make me cry, ok.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.900
Go, go quickly, Ralphie.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.520
and remember, wherever you are, my love

20:05.990 --> 20:07.620
and my coffee maker

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
we'll go with you.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.420
-I can't.  -Oh, yes you can.

20:12.430 --> 20:14.230
Oh. No, no, no, I can't.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.640
The hole in my heart is too big to be

20:16.640 --> 20:20.440
filled by such a small household appliance.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.460
How big is the hole, Ralphie?

20:24.350 --> 20:25.580
I don't know.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.610
About the size that plasma screen TV over there.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.290
I think I got something better,

20:32.290 --> 20:34.730
for you to keep closer to your heart.

20:42.910 --> 20:47.770
Ralphie boy, should've stopped with the coffee maker.

20:51.710 --> 20:56.790
You know, can't help feeling this is partly our fault.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.850
Well it's just that we were so happy,

20:59.850 --> 21:02.000
we wanted you to be so happy too.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.270
Partly?

21:02.010 --> 21:04.770
-I am happy.  -Of course you are.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.580
-I am.  -Whatever you say.

21:09.380 --> 21:10.660
-Let it go.  -Ok.

21:11.180 --> 21:15.210
Look when it's time for me to have a boyfriend, I will.

21:15.220 --> 21:19.110
But for right now, all I need is my best friends.

21:20.360 --> 21:25.420
And they're promised to stop trying to set me up

21:25.430 --> 21:27.300
unless you know Robert Pattinson.

21:27.310 --> 21:30.220
Are you kidding? If I knew Robert Pattinson, I would totally

21:30.520 --> 21:32.410
set you up with him.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.860
Nice save.

21:34.950 --> 21:37.160
Oh, come on, Olliepop, you know you are my guy.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.220
-I'd better be.  -You are.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.580
-Ok.  -Ok.

21:41.590 --> 21:42.910
-Ok.  -Ok.

21:44.930 --> 21:48.000
Oh, guys, guys, did I forget to mention?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.510
Blah!

21:55.260 --> 21:57.410
Hey, Miley, Come on, we will go catch a movie.

21:57.410 --> 22:00.260
I think the new Will Smith one starts in like

22:00.690 --> 22:01.980
Why do I keep looking?

22:03.540 --> 22:06.000
Getting a text from Ralphie.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.920
"Look in Oliver's backpocket."

22:09.300 --> 22:10.800
Hey our watches.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.800
Wow, that guy is good.

22:13.210 --> 22:17.430
Hold on, "now check in Lilly's backpocket."

22:21.300 --> 22:22.400
Ewgh!!

22:24.360 --> 22:26.330
No, they are mine.

22:22.830 --> 22:24.350
Are those Ralphie's?
