00:26.067 --> 00:28.945
[woman chuckles] Percy, back up.
You're about to take the whole fence down.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.197
You're making me look bad, man.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.451
My name is Jamie Wallace-Griner,

00:34.534 --> 00:36.661
and I run Safe in Austin Rescue Ranch.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.165
[woman] Gonna try not to cry,
'cause I am a crier.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.042
If you feel it, let it out, honey.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.710
It's… It's-- Thank you.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.628
Um, Jamie's pretty special.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.757
She has this enormous heart.
It's just enormous.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.717
And we nominated her

00:51.301 --> 00:54.596
because I want you guys
to kind of spoil her a little bit.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.514
Because she just
gives and gives and gives.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.602
[Jamie] Safe in Austin
is a non-profit rescue

01:00.685 --> 01:03.730
for special-needs animals and children.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.899
-Pinch here. It just comes out.
-[girl] Oh, my gosh.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.192
-[Jamie] Feel that?
-[girl] Yes.

01:07.942 --> 01:12.530
[Jamie] When you see
a blind child petting a blind pony,

01:12.614 --> 01:15.742
it's like literal magic. [laughs]

01:15.825 --> 01:17.744
There's something very calming about him.

01:17.827 --> 01:18.787
-Right?
-[girl] Yes.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.540
It helps with a lot of things
like anxiety and taking a breath.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.044
Our official motto is,
"Rescue animals rescuing children."

01:26.127 --> 01:27.837
But it's really for anyone.

01:27.921 --> 01:28.755
There you go.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.381
[tablet] <i>My little piggies are hungry.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:33.176
Your little piggies are hungry.
Yes, they are. Let's go feed 'em.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.345
Let's go this way, handsome.

01:35.428 --> 01:40.183
Any family or child or adult
that has a superpower of some sort.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.395
Sometimes it's autism, selective mutism.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.232
We invite them out
to heal next to our animals.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.691
[Jamie] You do a good job, Chris.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.902
We're a facility of sort of last resort.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.072
Most of the time, when we get a call
from somebody about an animal,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.658
it's either take it in
or have it put down.

01:56.741 --> 02:00.203
[Jamie] We have 18 different species
and somewhere around 170 animals.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.289
Come on, Penelope! Come on, baby.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.794
I didn't plan on running a non-profit.
It just sort of accidentally happened.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.295
We got it. Good girl.

02:09.379 --> 02:13.633
[Karen] Jamie has such empathic abilities.
Sometimes a little too much.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.677
-[laughs] Understatement, isn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.597
[Karen] She kept taking these animals
that no one else wanted,

02:19.681 --> 02:24.102
and I'll be honest, I was kind of like,
"Jamie Marie, what are we doing?"

02:25.228 --> 02:28.231
[Jamie] Then David came into my life,
and he's sort of game.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
She accuses me of being
the crazy one about animals

02:31.234 --> 02:33.153
because I have
a tough time turning them down.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.363
[pig snorting]

02:35.446 --> 02:38.116
That was the problem is that
neither one of us will say no to it.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.075
[pig groans]

02:39.159 --> 02:43.163
Our house is well-loved
and well-used. [laughs]

02:44.831 --> 02:48.751
We do have at least three pot-bellied
pigs that sleep in the house at all times,

02:48.835 --> 02:52.380
15 cats,
20 dogs that live here permanently.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.383
There is no avoiding rescue.
It's just-- It's everywhere.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.968
-Gabey!
-[barking]

02:57.051 --> 02:59.220
-Come here, my love.
-[woman] Aww.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.223
I think Texas needs to go
into the timeout. Come on.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.143
I have three awesome kids.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.770
In the beginning,
it was them cleaning everything,

03:07.854 --> 03:10.148
feeding everybody,
helping me throughout the night.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.067
We had to go around at eight o'clock
at night and feed all the animals.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.736
I've done the most feeding, though.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.864
-That's true, but--
-I had to feed the chickens and, like…

03:17.947 --> 03:18.781
Chickens are easy.

03:18.865 --> 03:23.620
At this point,
I'm trying to avoid them resenting me as--

03:23.703 --> 03:27.749
[laughs] bringing in 50 bazillion animals
and people constantly.

03:27.832 --> 03:32.128
Oh, oh, let's try not to drop
any puppies right now. Bad timing.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.757
Thankfully, we have a good amount of
volunteers that help us handle the chores

03:35.840 --> 03:41.137
so that their moments with the animals
can be not, like, a 24-hour job.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.597
JoJo!

03:42.680 --> 03:44.599
No, thank you. No, thank you.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.560
No, thank you. I know.
I'm so sorry. Breakfast is coming.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.354
It is 24/7. Yeah.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.398
Okay. That's a good boy.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.276
There's no way to have this many animals
and this much special needs

03:55.360 --> 03:58.738
without somebody needing me at all times.

03:58.821 --> 04:02.408
She never takes time for herself.
Like, ever.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.204
-She doesn't have a chance to turn off?
-No, she really doesn't think about it.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.790
She's torn in
so many different directions.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.335
"I've gotta help the animals. I've gotta
help my kids. I gotta help everyone."

04:13.503 --> 04:15.713
Sometimes I'm like, "If I could just…

04:17.006 --> 04:20.468
you know, take a moment to not be sad

04:20.551 --> 04:24.973
about people or animals
that are hurting or being ignored."

04:25.056 --> 04:26.474
That's the hardest part.

04:26.557 --> 04:32.981
[laughs] I think not being able
to not care for, like, a second.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.190
[laughs]

04:34.774 --> 04:37.151
But I know that I'm here for,
like, a reason,

04:37.235 --> 04:39.862
and I would never step away from that,

04:39.946 --> 04:41.322

04:48.663 --> 04:51.874
[Karen] I wanna see her genuinely happy,

04:51.958 --> 04:55.962
and I just want her to get a little bit
of what she gives to other people.

04:56.087 --> 05:00.216
[Jonathan] Aww. That is so sweet.
No, don't apologize!

05:00.300 --> 05:04.178
Out of curiosity, like,
where do you keep these 170 animals?

05:04.262 --> 05:07.598
We don't really have the facilities
for as many animals as we have.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.685
I have 60 special-needs
farm animals and no barn.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.521
We don't have giant corporate sponsors.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.606
We don't have big fancy board members,
any of that.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.151
-She'll give a kidney to get a barn.
-[laughing]

05:18.234 --> 05:21.029
Maybe we can do it
without her giving an organ.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.613
-I would like that.
-[laughing]

05:22.697 --> 05:25.325
'Cause I know some people,
and I think--

05:25.408 --> 05:27.368
I think a barn could be in the cards.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.246
[Karen] Jamie will--
she will lose her mind.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.458
I'm gonna have to do some pre-work to it,
so she's gonna see some stuff going on.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.585
You're gonna have to make up
some believable stories.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.379
Well, I will for this. I will.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.084
So, she has a permanent shake,

07:40.168 --> 07:44.464
which would have got her euthanized
at any of the beef farms that she was at.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.379
They haven't done
anything wrong to anybody.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.715
And apparently I needed
to be healed by animals today,

08:27.798 --> 08:30.384
because I am a complete emotional mess.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.346
I have three awesome kids,
one of which has autism.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.388
His name's Jackson.

08:34.472 --> 08:39.519
Eight years ago, I brought home
a dog appropriately named Angel,

08:39.602 --> 08:44.315
an, um, she healed parts of his heart
that even I couldn't get to as his mother,

08:44.398 --> 08:46.567
and sort of inspired this whole concept

08:46.651 --> 08:49.487
of what happens when you put
animals and children together,

08:49.570 --> 08:52.114
but especially extra-needs
animals and children.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.033
Do you just get emotional
every single day?

08:54.116 --> 08:56.035
[Jamie] Uh, yeah, but…

08:56.118 --> 08:59.705
you just can't imagine, when a kid
gets out here and meets them, it's magic.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.375
And I know that I'm so lucky
to be able to experience that.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.628
So I don't take it for granted,
and I can make it through all the hard,

09:05.711 --> 09:08.130
because the magic is so freaking cool.

[Jamie] So, this is Jackson,
who I was telling you about.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.176
Angel came into his life
and sort of inspired this whole concept.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.386
[Tan] Wow.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.096
-[Jamie] Are you okay?
-[Jackson] Yes.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.640
Hey, there's a lot going on.

Would you like to grab my puppy?
She's an angel.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.021
-Would you like to?
-Sure.

She really is an angel.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.024
-[Jackson] Yes.
-Yeah.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.193
She's got very warm.
I think it was my clammy hands. I'm sorry.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.864
Would you tell us why you think
your mom is just the very best?

10:14.947 --> 10:17.158
-[James] She's a little crazy.
-[Jackson] Yeah.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.784
-[laughing]
-That's why she's the best.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.786
-[laughing] Yeah!
-We love a crazy mom.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.121
[Antoni] We like the crazy.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.914
-It's a good crazy.
-We love a crazy mom.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.042
What do you think
we can help your mom with?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.711
-Fashion.
-[Jovie] She doesn't wash her hair.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.588
-She doesn't.
-[Antoni] The truth comes out.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.299
Okay, what else?
Who makes all the family dinners?

10:33.382 --> 10:34.342
-DoorDash.
-[Tan] Oh!

10:34.425 --> 10:36.844
Teenagers. [laughs]

10:36.927 --> 10:37.970
Since we're in the kitchen,

10:38.054 --> 10:40.473
I'd love to have a little moment with you,
if that's okay

10:40.556 --> 10:42.266
-Fine?
-[Jonathan] We're gonna go puppy bond.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.061
[Tan] Yeah.
We're gonna go find more puppies.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.229
It was so nice meeting you all.

10:49.231 --> 10:52.109
[Tan] Wow. Mommy loves her fringe.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.654
[Jonathan] Oh.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.658
[Antoni] Can we do a little snoop?

10:58.741 --> 11:01.035
[Jamie] A little of everything. Oh. Hi.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.453
Baking?

11:03.245 --> 11:05.164
-Um, what--
-[Antoni laughs]

11:05.247 --> 11:10.336
You seem… You seem surprised
to see all… all of this baking equipment.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.296
You have a stand mixer.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.173
No shortage of marshmallows. [laughs]

11:14.256 --> 11:16.884
Yeah, I don't know what's
going on with that. Vegan and regular.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.720
-Like everything.
-I've had these vegan ones. Really good.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.055
Formula.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.932
Formula for…

11:23.015 --> 11:24.058
Oh, for the goats.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.936
-[laughs] They're all on formula.
-I was like, you have babies here?

11:27.019 --> 11:29.647
-I wouldn't even be surprised, frankly.
-[laughs]

11:30.981 --> 11:32.692
Hey, baby.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.987
[Jamie] Food is complicated in my world.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.824
There's a lot of people
that don't understand,

11:39.907 --> 11:41.992
um, because I rescue farm animals,

11:42.076 --> 11:46.038
that I am not adamantly putting veganism

11:46.122 --> 11:49.417
on anybody that comes to visit
and everybody out there.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.878
Do you follow a plant-based diet
personally? Do you eat meat?

11:52.962 --> 11:57.007
Jovie and I don't eat meat,
and then the boys waver back and forth.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.177
-Okay.
-And then our guests have an option.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.847
We have a vegan snack drawer
and a regular snack drawer.

12:02.930 --> 12:06.475
And it's complicated,
because I suck at cooking anyway.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.478
I do walk into a grocery store
and I'm like, "What the heck?"

12:09.562 --> 12:12.231
I don't understand how people
look at all this and think,

12:12.314 --> 12:13.941
"I can make this and this and this."

12:14.024 --> 12:15.985
-You just get overwhelmed.
-Yeah.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.987
-[Antoni] Yeah. Hello.
-[Jonathan] Hi.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.822
-Oh, gosh. Oh, no.
-What?

12:19.905 --> 12:23.617
-It was really nice talking to you.
-You too. Thank you for understanding.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.745
-Let's go look at your bathroom.
-[Jamie] Okay.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.956
I did find horse shampoo
in your shower and no others.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.792
-Is it Mane 'N Tail shampoo?
-It is, but there's no other shampoo.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.710
Oh.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.712
That's like,
we've committed to that shampoo.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.423
-[Antoni] It worked for me for ten years.
-[Jamie laughs]

12:37.506 --> 12:39.133
I'll keep looking. You guys go.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.719
[Jonathan] PS.
I'm obsessed with these tiles.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.430
-Not that I'm like, Bobby design.
-[laughs]

12:44.513 --> 12:46.432
You are beautiful. Can I see your hair?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.768
Okay, yes, sure.

12:48.851 --> 12:49.894
So I do think--

12:49.977 --> 12:53.272
like, I love that you don't
overwash your hair. It's not good to do.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.816
Okay.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.943
Do you do your own color?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.069
Yes.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.656
-It's just this bluish, blackish thing.
-Right.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.285
It's, like--
I let the 14-year-old pick it out.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.620
-[Jonathan] Okay.
-[laughs]

13:07.703 --> 13:09.830
No, I'm not mad at her at all.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.875
So, what happens when you,
like, on a daily basis--

13:12.958 --> 13:16.003
-I'm the worst morning person ever.
-Not a morning person?

13:16.086 --> 13:17.171
-[Jamie] No.
-Okay.

13:17.254 --> 13:21.008
I get up and then I go pee,
and then I put my hat on,

13:21.091 --> 13:24.887
and then I go take care of my animals,
and that's, like, legitimately…

13:25.471 --> 13:27.723
I just don't know about
all that adulting stuff.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.767
Yeah. Your lashes stun.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.352
Oh, yes. Thank you.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.855
I barter for my lashes for my friend
that's been doing it for years.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.273
-Yes.
-I babysit her dogs.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.859
She's doing a really good job.
Your eyes are giving me pow.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.861
Jamers, you're gorgeous.

13:40.945 --> 13:45.157
You're doing the most,
but "rest" is not a bad four-letter word.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.077
I do want to help you cultivate
some self-care, though.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.162
It's the self-care that's lacking.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.373
One thing I really was struck by,
just first meeting you

13:52.456 --> 13:55.251
is that, like, I can just tell
that you're close to your edge.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.546
I know.
I know I need, like, more self-care.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.588
I wish I had, like…

13:59.672 --> 14:02.800
-20,000 more hours in the day already.
-Totally.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.011
And that doesn't make you any--
That just makes you a human.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.641
[goats bleating]

14:10.724 --> 14:13.519
Are you the king of the igloo? Yeah?

14:13.602 --> 14:17.439
[imitates bleating]

14:17.523 --> 14:19.775
I would love
to talk about your closet, please.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.862
-Okay.
-Um, first off, I can't get in.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.532
-[Jamie] Well, I call it my "cloffice."
-Uh-huh.

14:26.615 --> 14:32.413
And it's because I sit in my giant
bean bag chair and cry or post.

14:32.496 --> 14:38.085
-It's like my runaway place. [laughs]
-[sobs] Oh! Jamie, no!

14:38.168 --> 14:41.005
Let's clear out your sad sack.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.173
-[Jamie laughs] My sad sack!
-Clear out the sad sack.

14:43.257 --> 14:48.262
How incredibly sad that she goes to
kind of escape and shut off from the world

14:48.345 --> 14:50.681
in this depressing space
where these clothes

14:50.764 --> 14:53.350
have not seen the light of day
in many, many, many, many years.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.351
Okay.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.563
You've got the look on your face
like a naughty schoolgirl.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.357
-[Jamie] It's just decoration, really.
-It's a lot.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.026
[Jamie] I don't really wear any of this.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.194
-[Jamie] I wear yoga pants and shorts.
-Okay.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.990
And I don't know that
I could fit into most of these clothes.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.784
I assume you were, like, a girly girl.

15:10.868 --> 15:15.080
Not only the heels, but you've
got dresses. You've got very girly stuff.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.374
Was this ever you?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.669
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I used to have really good legs.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.716
I was a dancer before
the whole kid-and-animal concept.

15:25.799 --> 15:30.512
Now, I go to Tractor Supply and Target
sometimes, and that's really about it.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.848
[Tan] Her everyday life is Safe in Austin.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.558
She just needs a break.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.144
Maybe let's change
the way we use this closet.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.940
No more the crying closet.
Let's make it a joyful closet.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.697
[Bobby] Come on, babe. Aww. Yeah.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.033
Yeah, are you a pretty baby?

15:53.535 --> 15:55.162
All right, here's where the fun starts.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.915
Bumpy, bumpy, bumpy.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.213
-This is why it's worth it.
-Look at that. Oh, my gosh.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.465
[Jamie] I say, "Welcome to my church."

16:10.302 --> 16:13.514
How often do you get to find time
for yourself? To do stuff like this?

16:14.431 --> 16:18.143
-[laughs] That's not really a thing.
-That means no.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.645
Why is that not a thing?

16:19.728 --> 16:23.983
There is never a moment
in any part of any day, day or night,

16:24.066 --> 16:30.030
that there isn't someone that could
use my help, animal or human.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.198
[Karamo] Yeah.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.116
Ever.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.200
Yeah.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.828
I take in the ones
that nobody else wants to,

16:35.911 --> 16:39.373
so that involves commitment,
and I'm okay with that, but…

16:39.873 --> 16:40.708
Um…

16:41.500 --> 16:44.837
-But that just means a 24-hour deal.
-Yeah.

16:46.296 --> 16:51.260
You're coming across people every day
that have challenges in their life

16:51.343 --> 16:54.013
that in your mind are like,
"That's a real challenge."

16:54.096 --> 16:56.015
And so what we start to do is we start

16:56.098 --> 16:59.643
to minimize our experiences
and our challenges.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.978
You deserve more.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.857
Because burnout in
these type of positions is real.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.652
Well, I'm really tough. I can take it.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.071
[laughs]

17:11.155 --> 17:14.575
That right there,
that's the mindset that has to change.

17:16.994 --> 17:21.331
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't know that,
because I preach it all the time.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.667
I just don't know
what it looks like for me.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.919
-That makes sense.
-[shudders]

17:26.003 --> 17:28.464
And I'm afraid to let anybody down.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.508
[sighs] I need help.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.928
That makes sense.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.898
[Jamie] Come meet my big girls.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.735
-I love pigs. They have the best souls.
-They're so smart.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.488
-So smart, so kind.
-They're so smart.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.866
What has been probably one of
the most trying times you've had here?

17:55.949 --> 17:59.369
-The weather has been insanely ridiculous.
-Right.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.080
We had this crazy ice apocalypse,

18:01.163 --> 18:04.458
and then it's been raining
like we live in…

18:04.541 --> 18:06.293
-Like crazy.
-…Seattle or something.

18:06.376 --> 18:10.130
We do everything one, you know,
donated fence panel at a time.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.591
-So, we have to get creative, but…
-[laughs]

18:12.674 --> 18:16.720
There's a whole gamut of things that we're
just sort of making up as we go along.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.933
This… This year, we're…
we're calling it "The Year of The Barn."

18:21.016 --> 18:22.226
Okay, the Year of The Barn.

18:22.309 --> 18:26.897
It's kind of an ongoing joke that I have
60 special-needs farm animals and no barn.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.316
But that's, like, a someday.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.902
-A big dream. [laughs]
-A someday.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.404
-Oh, my gosh.
-During the freeze, what was that like?

18:34.488 --> 18:37.157
I heard there was
some horses in the house.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.117
It was terrifying,

18:38.200 --> 18:41.995
because every animal here comes
from a place that was scary or sad.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.874
I brought them here, and I promised them
that they were safe from now on.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.128
And so, when things happen
and I'm seeing icicles all over them,

18:49.211 --> 18:51.713
and I know that
they're uncomfortable, and it's scary,

18:51.797 --> 18:53.924
and that feels like
I'm breaking a promise.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.175
Did you lose anybody?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.927
We did lose a couple, I believe,

18:57.010 --> 18:59.471
to sort of the stress
of the whole thing. Yeah.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.516
They're just trying
to make it through every day,

19:02.599 --> 19:07.104
learning as they go,
with 170-plus animals.

19:07.187 --> 19:12.151
I hope that Jamie sees this farm as
something that she literally manifested.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.240
You've got this new slab over here.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.243
-I hear you got this donated recently?
-Mm-hmm.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.494
You come to me.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.038
-Come to Daddy Karamo.
-[Karamo] You come to me.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.915
-Hi, dear.
-Hi, dear.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.002
[Bobby] So, I hear that you guys had
a nice anonymous donor

19:30.586 --> 19:33.338
that poured you a slab
for the Year of The Barn.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.215
-[laughs]
-It wasn't an anonymous donor.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.967
The Year of The Barn is today.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.303
-[Jonathan] It's happening!
-[Antoni] Yay!

19:39.887 --> 19:42.848
-[Karen shouts]
-[scattered laughter]

19:42.931 --> 19:45.225
I would think that makes a lot more sense.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.561
[all laughing]

19:48.604 --> 19:50.856
You know, you were
talking earlier about how it killed you

19:50.939 --> 19:52.065
that when that freeze came,

19:52.149 --> 19:54.484
you felt like you couldn't
keep your promise to those animals

19:54.568 --> 19:57.154
that you would never let
anything bad happen again.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.449
And now we're gonna give you
the power to keep that promise. So…

20:00.532 --> 20:03.118
The Year of The Barn is now!

20:03.202 --> 20:05.370
[all cheering]

20:08.207 --> 20:10.542
-[Antoni] Group hug!
-[Jamie] Get in here!

[Karamo] Jamie thinks
that this is all on her,

20:25.515 --> 20:28.227
which is pressure that
she shouldn't be putting on herself.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.813
I want, for one moment, for her
not to feel that weight on her shoulders,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.149
so she can remember, you're not alone.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.986
[Jonathan] Safe in Austin is
a gorgeous sanctuary for animals, honey,

20:38.070 --> 20:41.031
but I need to know,
where is Jamie's sanctuary for herself?

20:41.114 --> 20:45.035
I just want Jamie to remember
that she's a multifaceted person.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.538
You can do all sorts of things that
bring you happy and still be of service.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.714

20:58.298 --> 21:01.843
I'm going to come up with whatever I can
to make her feel her very best

21:01.927 --> 21:04.346
and have a moment of happiness.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.766
[Antoni] With Jamie,
I think it's incredibly important

21:07.849 --> 21:10.686
to take her away from the farm
just for a couple of days,

21:10.769 --> 21:12.896
with her knowing that she has the support

21:12.980 --> 21:15.649
of everybody taking care of things
while she's gone.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.109
Oh, my gosh. This is fun.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.195
[Antoni] Miraval is a perfect space
where she can actually rest.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.155
I don't think I've met anybody in my life

21:22.239 --> 21:26.326
who needed actual rest more than Jamie.

21:26.952 --> 21:32.374
Big dreams require big actions,
and we are about to go big with Jamie.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.835
It's definitely gonna be
larger than I had even realized.

21:34.918 --> 21:35.752
[Bobby] Look at this.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.045
It's gonna be incredible.

-[Bobby] Six horse stalls.
-Yeah.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.258
[Bobby] She's pulled in so many
different directions on the farm.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.677
So, we worked with Bettr Homes
to come up with a design

21:43.760 --> 21:46.638
to centralize everything
that she needs to get done

21:46.722 --> 21:49.725
and free up a lot of time
to take care of herself.

[Karamo] This is Jamie.

-Thank you.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.425
Jamie works with animals.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.678
So, she knows this process.
We're just flipping the script on her.

-The teacher is now the student.
-[Leigh] Yeah.

22:28.805 --> 22:32.184
Jamie understands the value
of bringing kids to her farm

22:32.267 --> 22:33.894
so that they can heal with the animals.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.355
I want this to be a process
where you two are connecting

22:36.438 --> 22:37.856
and the animals are connecting.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.858
My hope is
that through this equine therapy

22:39.941 --> 22:42.569
she can start
to heal through animals herself.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.405
[Leigh] So, you have horses too?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.282
We do, yeah, seven.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.993
[Leigh] Your understanding of horses,
how they're used for therapy…

22:50.077 --> 22:51.912
-Have you had experience with that?
-Yes, yes.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.332
I invite children out
to be with the animals

22:55.415 --> 22:58.835
and find that healing
that we all know animals can provide.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.046
-Now, I have 173 rescue animals.
-Oh, my.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.715
[chuckles] And I take care of
a lot of people and animals,

23:03.799 --> 23:07.177
and… and I'm not doing
the best at remembering…

23:08.512 --> 23:09.805
me, I guess.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.432
We like to talk about paying attention
with not just our eyes,

23:12.516 --> 23:14.017
but with our whole heart.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.020
So, it definitely feels like I'm…

23:18.522 --> 23:20.440
You know, I'm on all the time.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.525
[Leigh] Yeah.

23:22.275 --> 23:26.863
So today, we'd like
to give you the opportunity

23:26.947 --> 23:28.990
to learn to make a request.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.285
So horses don't speak English.
They speak energy.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.538
Well, you know that
from what you do, right?

23:34.621 --> 23:37.833
And I really want you to feel
into your body any sensations, images,

23:37.916 --> 23:40.627

and just really feel yourself.

Maybe you can find a way
to bring that back in.

Would you like to try to ask him
to walk around the circle outside of you?

24:31.428 --> 24:34.931
It's good practice, right? To see,
"How does it feel when I make a request?"

24:35.015 --> 24:37.100
[Jamie] Sure. I'd be interested for sure.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.144
[Leigh] So, ask him to go.

I throw it on the ground really hard
so the rabbits and tortoises can eat it.

-Cilantro.
-Yeah! Do you like cilantro?

30:51.975 --> 30:53.977
-[Jamie] Mm-hmm.
-Roll it up like this.

30:54.060 --> 30:57.438

with the blade of your knife…

30:58.022 --> 31:00.608
There's no rush. Excellent.

-Weird.

"It's amazing."

31:10.577 --> 31:12.537

-But what's weird about it?

31:12.620 --> 31:13.872

-Do you miss the animals?
-Yeah.

31:16.583 --> 31:21.880

and I worry if anyone's needing me, but…

31:21.963 --> 31:23.923
You're worried if they're needing you?

31:24.007 --> 31:26.676

something like this every few months,

31:47.238 --> 31:48.823

that she can have for herself,

and her husband or her kids.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.877
-So, gochujang is a Korean chili paste.
-Okay.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.339
Pour in a bit of maple syrup
for sweetness and then you whisk it up.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.926
I just, like, go in with my pinky.

32:10.678 --> 32:11.554

49:30.550 --> 49:32.970
[Antoni] How in the hell are we
supposed to get off of this?

49:33.053 --> 49:36.098
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Tan] You should do like you! Real cute.

49:36.181 --> 49:38.475

49:39.309 --> 49:42.688
Thank you so, so much.
I'm so sad you're leaving. [laughs]

49:42.771 --> 49:44.022
We're not gonna be far.

49:44.106 --> 49:46.400
-[Jonathan] I live here.
-[Bobby] Not walking out forever.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.235
-[Karen] Can I hug you?
-[Bobby] Of course!

49:48.318 --> 49:49.152
[laughing]

49:49.236 --> 49:50.946
-I love you.
-Group hug!

49:51.029 --> 49:52.948
-[cheering]
-Thank you so much.

49:53.031 --> 49:54.074
[Jamie] I love you.

49:54.157 --> 49:57.703
This poor woman was exhausted
when we came around.

49:57.786 --> 50:01.748
It's funny. Sometimes the most giving
people forget to give to themselves.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.918
But in reality, we know that
we need to take time for ourselves

50:05.002 --> 50:06.962
in order to keep giving to others.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.797
[laughs] Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah!

50:08.880 --> 50:12.551
She has an amazing support structure
that she really needs to tap into

50:12.634 --> 50:14.428
and allow them to help her more.

50:14.511 --> 50:16.722
[Antoni] Please make sure
she takes care of herself.

50:17.431 --> 50:23.687
This week helped me see that it's not
about a ginormous amount of time.

50:23.770 --> 50:27.733
I can take care of myself
in little moments here and there.

50:27.816 --> 50:30.944
Get off the express train
and just go climb a tree.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.030
-We love you very, very much.
-I love you so much.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.449
-Bye, everybody.
-Thank you for everything.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.117
[Jamie] Thank you! Bye!

50:37.200 --> 50:39.953
-[Jonathan] Be careful now! Have fun!
-[Jamie] Love you!

My Spanx are too tight today.

-You forgot.

51:19.409 --> 51:23.121
I left the dates and the Marcona almonds
because I didn't think you would want any.

One of us likes animals. The other wants
to run right now. Right? You feel that?

This feels like when I'm with my friends
and I talk about my dog too much

51:34.633 --> 51:36.051
and they all just walk away.
