00:01.535 --> 00:04.405
LAINEY: Back in the '80s,
I was a cheerleader,
and it was a blast.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.740
But in the '90s,
it went to a whole new level.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.576
The cheerleaders were finally
seen as athletes,

00:08.609 --> 00:11.011
and TV competitions
captured our attention.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.747
Okay, girls. Know who's jazzed
to be your new coach?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.483
Here's a clue...
Whoo!

00:18.319 --> 00:19.520
Sorry, it's me.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.654
I'm just excited.
(CHUCKLES)

00:20.688 --> 00:22.123
Used to be a cheerleader
back in the day.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.425
I was actually team captain,
became real popular.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.794
Dated the Quaker mascot,
became less popular.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.229
Was it a mistake?
Yeah, perhaps.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.530
Do I still love the guy?
Who knows.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.831
His name was Barry.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.666
It was a long time ago.
He's a doctor now.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.834
We're getting off topic.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.170
Point is,
we're gonna kill it.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.438
Can I get a "Go Quakers!"?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.806
Go Quakers!

00:38.839 --> 00:40.007
I didn't hear you.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.310
(LOUDER)
Go Quakers!

00:42.343 --> 00:43.744
Damn right!
Now, let's get to work!

00:48.882 --> 00:51.051
(THUD)
What's going on right now?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.221
We gotta decorate the football
players' lockers today.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.189
And then we gotta
bake them all
game-day desserts.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.191
Oh, man. I forgot about
this part of cheerleading.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.227
Girls,
cheerleading has changed.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.961
It's not just about
rooting on the players.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.896
You're all just as much
of athletes as they are.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.565
We are?
Of course.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.235
You've seen cheerleading
competitions on ESPN, right?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.502
ESPN?

01:08.536 --> 01:09.903
That's
my dad's channel.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.071
Everyone, follow me.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.642
See, these girls
are fierce competitors.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.710
And you can be
just as badass.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.845
You really think so?

01:17.878 --> 01:19.880
Yes! But it means
more time practicing

01:19.913 --> 01:21.382
and less time
baking and crafting.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.384
So you really think
the football team
will go for this?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.753
I'll talk to Coach Mellor.
Coach to coach.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.854
What do you say, girls?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.088
We are so in.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.190
Go Quakers!

01:29.223 --> 01:30.391
Go Quakers!

01:32.260 --> 01:35.062
* One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here

01:35.095 --> 01:38.065
* Live your life
and finally be free

01:38.098 --> 01:40.834
* Go where you wanna go,
do what you wanna do

01:40.868 --> 01:44.772
* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

01:44.805 --> 01:46.907
LAINEY: It was April 3rd,
1990-something,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.876
and the school was on fire
with gossip.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.412
Back before social media,
it spread the old-fashioned
way...

01:51.445 --> 01:52.846
Notes and word of mouth.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.949
And no gossip was hotter
than news
of an after-school fight.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.385
Oh, this excites me.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.787
I heard Raday
was talking smack
about Reza in the pit,

01:59.820 --> 02:01.555
and he went berserk
and called him out.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.691
I heard
Raday and Reza's families

02:03.724 --> 02:06.394
are sworn mortal enemies
that date back centuries.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.096
Whoa, wait.
Who's fighting who now?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
Not Raday and Reza.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.166
Saved it.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.468
Code Red, people.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.304
Word of a fight
has spread like wildfire.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.540
Reza versus Raday, 2:30 sharp,
behind the gymnatorium.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.874
We got to
stop 'em now.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.910
Come on! Let's go.
Whoa, wait.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.312
Stop 'em? Why?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.046
'Cause we're teachers
and that's our job?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.781
Our job is to teach
these kids

02:27.815 --> 02:29.883
how to settle
their differences
by themselves.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.819
Just look
the other way.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.587
I'm sorry. Are you saying
we should allow these kids

02:33.621 --> 02:35.088
to just smack
each other around

02:35.122 --> 02:37.525
like Sgt. Slaughter
and Captain Lou Albano?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.060
What? I like WWF.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.629
I find the story lines
very compelling.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.965
Yes. That is how young men
squash their beef.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.934
No, we need to help them
squash the beef

02:46.967 --> 02:50.103
by talking it out
like normal,
rational adults.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.239
Talk? Come on.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.173
Have you ever had
beef to squash, CB?

02:53.207 --> 02:54.408
Not really.
Trust me.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.809
You let 'em
throw a few punches,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.678
or their beef
is gonna get beefier

02:57.711 --> 02:59.347
until it
can't be contained.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.448
Okay, there is no way

03:00.481 --> 03:02.182
that I'm letting
the entire student body

03:02.216 --> 03:03.951
stand outside
chanting "fight"

03:03.984 --> 03:06.287
as two nice kids
throw haymakers at each other.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.855
STUDENTS:
(CHANTING IN DISTANCE) Fight!

03:07.888 --> 03:10.023
Well, it seems we've
been debating
this issue so long

03:10.057 --> 03:11.425
that it's now 2:30.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.461
Damn it, Crosby!
You were stalling on purpose.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.662
Little bit.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.297
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

03:16.330 --> 03:19.267
They're doing that thing
where they're super charged
and in each other's faces.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.302
And now they're
doing that thing where
they jerk their arms

03:21.335 --> 03:22.603
like they're
about to throw a punch,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.538
causing the other one
to flinch like a little punk.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.906
And now Raday's doing
that hockey move!

03:25.939 --> 03:29.209
I'm going in!
Hey, everyone,
simmer down, okay?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.211
I'm breaking this up.
Pardon me.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.681
I am also breaking this up
because I am appalled

03:33.714 --> 03:36.149
at this pathetic display
of boxing skill.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.853
Okay, ignore everything that
your shop teacher just said
and get back to class.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.989
LAINEY: The next day,
Mr. Glascott discovered that,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.724
as the new principal,
he'd lost touch

03:43.757 --> 03:45.058
with what was happening
on the ground.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.260
Code Red, people.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.662
Just got word there's gonna be
a bare-knuckle throwdown,

03:48.696 --> 03:50.498
2:30 sharp
behind the gymnatorium.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.300
That was yesterday,
and we broke it up.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.801
What?
Don't sweat it, John.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.002
You're head
of the school now.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.870
You have more important things
to worry about.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.507
What exactly could be
more important
than the actual children?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.874
Well, you know,
all the important stuff

04:00.908 --> 04:03.744
like budgeting, and, um,
allocating the money,

04:03.777 --> 04:06.480
and scheduling the funds
and where they go.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.915
Those are all
the same thing.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.183
CB, set up a meeting
with me and those boys.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.019
No need, boss.
Already dealing with it.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.887
Without me?
But I'm head of school.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.256
Which is why I assumed
that you would want
nothing to do with this.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.425
Well,
you assumed wrong.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.192
So, what exactly
is your plan?

04:19.226 --> 04:21.261
Fight Club.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.896
Oh, yeah,
now we're talking!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.032
Fight club?
Are you nuts, man?

04:25.065 --> 04:27.401
Okay, calm down.
The first rule
of this Fight Club

04:27.435 --> 04:29.036
is that there's no fighting
in Fight Club.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.971
Instead, we read
the book Fight Club

04:31.004 --> 04:32.172
and then talk about it.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.074
So it's
a book club.
No.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.176
Sounds like a book club.
Fine, it's a book club.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.146
But it'll give the boys
an opportunity
to have real dialogue.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.848
I hate
this fight club.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.017
Wow, that's actually
a fantastic idea, CB.
Thanks.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.454
And just the thing I need
to get back on the ground

04:46.487 --> 04:48.556
where I belong,
helping these students again.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.623
Wait, what?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.359
John, I was hoping
to run point on this.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.960
I mean, it took me a while
to make the flyer.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.196
At first
I tried bubble letters,
then, um, puffy paint...

04:56.229 --> 04:58.799
Well, an issue this important
needs to be handled correctly,

04:58.832 --> 05:00.434
and, as a former GC,

05:00.468 --> 05:02.235
guidance counselor,

05:02.269 --> 05:03.804
I have
more experience.
Right.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.938
But that's
not your job anymore,

05:04.972 --> 05:06.574
which is why I think
the kids would prefer me.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.241
You made the right call
on the no bubble letters.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.443
You can feel good
about that.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.611
Can I at least
come to the meeting?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.779
Of course you can!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.781
That way you can see
how it's done.
O-Okay.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.884
I look forward to seeing
how the idea I just told you
is done.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.620
LAINEY: Principal Glascott
was insecure about being
replaced,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.121
but I was confident
Coach would help me

05:21.154 --> 05:22.790
take cheerleading
to the next level.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.124
Hey, Rick. Got a sec?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.827
For you, "Coach Lewis"?
Of course!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.496
Come in, come in!

05:28.529 --> 05:29.730
Gah, there you are.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.331
Wow, you're excited
to see me.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.134
Well, of course I am!
Because you've just begun
your coaching journey.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.936
Ah,
how I envy you.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.973
Soon you'll be glowing
with what we in the
coaching world call that...

05:40.007 --> 05:41.141
Coaching glow.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.043
Oh, here you go.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.113
Go on and take it.
Your first whistle.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.347
Once that's
slung around your neck,

05:47.381 --> 05:48.449
you'll
never be the same.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.150
Anyway, I wanted to talk
about the cheerleaders.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.152
Whatever you need,
it's done.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.854
Coaches helping coaches.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.088
That's what this
is all about.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.490
Perfect, 'cause I've
entered the girls

05:56.524 --> 05:57.791
into this big
cheerleading competition,

05:57.825 --> 05:59.026
but there's no time
to practice

05:59.059 --> 06:01.328
'cause they got to
decorate lockers and
make food and stuff.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.296
Ah! That reminds me.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.965
Recipe
for seafood gumbo.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.768
Nothing gets me
pumped for battle like
good old fish stew.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.671
Oh, right, I remember
the pre-game gumbo
we had to make.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.040
One of our school's
time-honored traditions.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.875
William Penn himself
loved the gumbo,

06:14.908 --> 06:16.477
a new taste
from far away.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.878
God, it's
so many ingredients.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.980
That's why it tastes
like victory, Coach.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.049
Go Quakers!
Okay, you're not getting it.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.952
My cheerleaders can't
make the gumbo that
simmers for 16 hours

06:24.985 --> 06:26.454
and win regionals.
Understand?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.856
Looks like you've got
your first coaching obstacle.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.892
But the great coaches,
they figure it out.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.161
Are you a great coach,
Lainey Lewis?

06:34.194 --> 06:37.397
Uh, you bet
your blue-shorted ass I am.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.733
I'll give you my word
as a fellow coach
you'll get your gumbo.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.901
Fight, Quakers,
fight.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.303
LAINEY: So, in order to get
more time to practice,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.172
I went to some kids
I was pretty sure

06:45.205 --> 06:47.240
would be willing to help
the cheerleaders.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.876
Attention,
chess club.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.744
The cheerleaders are
in dire need of help,

06:50.778 --> 06:52.345
and you're
our only hope.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.547
So,
what do you say?

06:53.581 --> 06:54.715
No, no, no, no.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.517
We're playing
a game of the mind, here.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.418
Shut up,
Ellen!

06:59.520 --> 07:00.854
Whatever it is,
we'll do it.

07:00.888 --> 07:04.424
Yeah. Consider us your bishops
in shining armor.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.827
Gah,
I mean knights!

07:06.860 --> 07:08.596
I'm just so...
Flustered!

07:08.629 --> 07:09.697
(CHESS PIECE CLATTERS)

07:09.730 --> 07:12.032
But yes.
The answer's "yes."

07:12.065 --> 07:14.367
LAINEY: I found my solution
to my problem,

07:14.401 --> 07:17.170
and Glascott found
CB's solution to his.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.673
Okay, boys,
welcome to Fight Club.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.441
TOGETHER: Yeah!

07:21.475 --> 07:23.844
We got a few rules
to discuss.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.713
The first rule
of fight club is...

07:25.746 --> 07:27.247
TOGETHER:
There is no fight club!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.382
...there's no fighting
in fight club.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.351
Wait, what?
Rule number two,

07:31.384 --> 07:33.521
do not touch the boiler.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.356
You will be burned,
and your parents will sue us.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.058
So that's a no-no.
Seriously?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.259
Rule number three,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.895
if you find the biology lab's
lost corn snake,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.564
do not approach it.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.299
She's pregnant
and very irritable.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.235
So, this isn't
a fight club at all.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.437
CB said the point of us
coming down here

07:50.470 --> 07:51.939
was to work out
our problems.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.075
Forget about CB. Ol' Glascott
is leading the charge now.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.244
And it'll feel
like fight club

07:57.277 --> 07:59.647
when we start reading
Fight Club.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.814
So it's a book club.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.915
CB: John?
Hmm?

08:01.949 --> 08:03.116
Can I talk to you?
Now?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.052
All right,
I'll be right back.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.320
Stop eyeballing that boiler,
Mankewitz.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.091
You changed
the meeting time.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.560
You said I could be
a part of this.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.094
Yes, but then
I saw the movie,

08:14.127 --> 08:15.896
and I realized
Ed Norton's whole problem

08:15.929 --> 08:17.998
was that Brad Pitt
kept interfering,

08:18.031 --> 08:19.933
so I decided to run
the club on my own.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.069
First of all,
Brad Pitt wasn't interfering.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.136
He's not even there.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.437
Well, for someone
who wasn't there,

08:24.471 --> 08:26.073
he sure did pop up a lot,
didn't he?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.575
Yes, 'cause he's
in Ed Norton's head.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.676
In his head?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.778
Brad Pitt was hooking up
with Helena Bonham Carter

08:30.811 --> 08:33.013
while Norton was eating cereal
in the kitchen.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.582
No, Ed Norton
hooked up with her.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.283
He just imagined
that she was with Pitt.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.651
So who's eating cereal?

08:37.685 --> 08:38.819
That part is unclear.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.353
Cereal
doesn't eat itself, CB.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.089
Okay, the movie
has some holes.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.757
But we were supposed
to do this together...

08:43.791 --> 08:45.025
STUDENTS:
(CHANTING IN DISTANCE) Fight!

08:45.058 --> 08:46.259
Damn it, not again.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.961
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

08:47.995 --> 08:49.096
Okay, okay.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.230
Enough!
(CHANTING STOPS)

08:50.263 --> 08:51.699
There's no fighting
in fight club.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.033
That's my
number one rule.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.236
For the record, your rules
and fight club make no sense.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.706
Oh, it's my club again.
I didn't make that flyer.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.440
It's a good thing that
I was here to break this up.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.809
Okay,
everybody out of here.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.344
CB's misguided Fight Club
is over.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.512
(SIGHS)

09:08.048 --> 09:10.017
What's this?
The team's
pre-game gumbo.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.320
Why are you presenting me
with the team's
pre-game gumbo, Ed Morris?

09:13.353 --> 09:14.655
Cheerleaders
are busy preparing

09:14.688 --> 09:16.156
for some
high-octane competition,

09:16.189 --> 09:18.692
so Ms. Lewis asked
the chess team to help out.
What?

09:18.726 --> 09:20.628
They're gonna root us on
at our next blitz tournament.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.529
Silently, of course.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.464
But actual female girls
will be there.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.498
Everyone wins!

09:26.734 --> 09:28.301
Okay, we have
a huge problem here.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.004
This school has glorious
traditions that must
be honored.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.040
Like the cheerleading
gumbo tradition.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.541
You can't
just change that.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.209
Didn't you get
Ed's gumbo?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.544
Oh, I got Ed's gumbo.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.679
It tasted
like six generations

09:38.712 --> 09:40.547
of loving home cooking
down on the bayou.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.015
But Ed is not
a cheerleader.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.751
Hey, I took
your coaching advice.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.019
I figured out a way to make
more time for practice

09:46.053 --> 09:48.155
so we can get ready
for regionals.
Come on.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.390
We both know my boys
are not gonna be happy

09:50.423 --> 09:52.893
with delicious gumbo
from the chess team.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.662
I'm not coaching
to make your boys happy.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.263
I'm coaching to make
my girls champions.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.999
Don't do that.
Don't make this
a boy-girl thing.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.701
I think you made this
a boy-girl thing

10:00.734 --> 10:04.237
when you turned your back
on Ed's delicious
seafood-and-sausage stew!

10:04.271 --> 10:07.708
Look, as much as
I appreciate your squad,
they're not athletes!

10:07.741 --> 10:09.943
They're cheerers.
It's right there
in the name.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.611
Not athletes, huh?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.747
What they're doing
is on ESPN,

10:13.781 --> 10:16.183
just like football
or basketball
or any other sport.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.419
No way is cheerleading
on ESPN...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.389
Sweet sod!
Jenny Nussbaum just flipped
like a land dolphin!

10:22.422 --> 10:24.624
Because this takes
real skill and strength.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.861
Sweet lord of Rah-Rah,
these ladies are fearless!

10:27.895 --> 10:29.262
Oh, God,
don't drop...

10:29.296 --> 10:31.064
Oh, what a save!
Did you see that?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.299
That's called
a "basket toss,"

10:32.332 --> 10:33.701
actually one
of our easiest moves.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.569
Sounds like you get
why we want to focus on this
instead of gumbo.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.637
Oh, I get it.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.773
Attention, cheerleaders!
No...

10:39.807 --> 10:41.608
Cheer athletes!

10:41.641 --> 10:45.045
From this moment on,
your glorious sport
is Mellor approved!

10:45.078 --> 10:47.447
Tradition as we know it
will never be the same!

10:48.181 --> 10:49.249
(GASPS)

10:49.282 --> 10:50.583
Oh! Oh.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.886
Maybe talk about
how the world's
changing after practice?

10:52.920 --> 10:53.987
Yes, I'm sorry.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.224
LAINEY: I had
convinced Coach Mellor

10:57.257 --> 10:58.726
that my cheerleaders
were athletes.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.894
Now he just had to convince
his players.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.295
Look, I know
you're all disappointed

11:02.329 --> 11:04.832
that the girls need to focus
on their own sport,

11:04.865 --> 11:06.233
but times are changing.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.902
Cheerleaders are now athletes
just like you guys!

11:08.936 --> 11:10.971
Does this mean
Marni's not gonna
decorate my locker anymore?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.640
No.
So, then, it'll be Cheryl?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.976
What? No. Nobody's decorating
anybody's locker.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.644
Then how will get
glitter and ribbons on them?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.746
You won't.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.114
From now on, all lockers
will be plain, bare metal

11:21.148 --> 11:22.515
with no arts and crafts
of any kind.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.818
But those decorated lockers
are how everyone in school

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
knows we're
awesome football players.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.856
It's cool, Weasel.
People will know when
they see the cheerleaders

11:28.889 --> 11:30.824
presenting us
with our game-day desserts.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.160
Guys,
this is not complicated.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.795
The cheerleaders
are no longer

11:34.828 --> 11:37.330
decorating your stuff
or baking you sweets.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.565
WEASEL: So, to be clear,

11:38.598 --> 11:42.635
the only thing
the cheerleaders now do
is cheer at our games?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.004
Yes.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.074
And if I may add,
there is a world where
they upstage you guys

11:47.107 --> 11:49.709
with their high-octane
acrobatic routines.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.779
Okay, I'm gonna speak
for the team here
and say "no."

11:51.812 --> 11:55.048
Look, I know tradition
is important,
and it will live on.

11:55.082 --> 11:58.986
How?
You now have the unwavering
support of the chess team,

11:59.019 --> 12:01.388
who will provide
all game-day treats.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.423
Who's up for some
homemade Louisiana lovin'?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.358
Come on! Get 'em out of here!
No!

12:05.392 --> 12:06.794
That's it.
No beignets for anyone.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.995
You'll not taste
one bite

12:08.028 --> 12:11.098
of their heavenly goodness.
Not one, okay?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.399
Go into my office,
men.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.134
You can watch me eat
these pastries on my own.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.302
We made three dozen
of these.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.569
Challenge accepted.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.372
LAINEY:
A day had passed since
the fight club book club

12:19.406 --> 12:20.908
turned into
an actual fight club,

12:20.941 --> 12:22.542
but the real battle
was now on.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.743
Hey, John.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.246
Um, I heard you're having
a sit-down with Alec and Reza.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.680
Yeah, that's right.

12:27.714 --> 12:31.184
General Glascott
has to return to the trenches
to save his troops.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.220
My point is,
I'm their class advisor.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.555
That's why you're invited
to watch me work my magic.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.957
By the time I'm done
with those boys,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.458
they're gonna be
best bros.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.396
Crazy.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.165
You're like
a pencil break black belt.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.067
Okay, enough.
What's going on here?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.201
I mean,
it has no official name,

12:48.235 --> 12:49.536
but we generally call it
pencil break.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.938
But that's
a whimsical game
of friendship.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.272
I haven't fixed
you two yet.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.573
Nah, we're good.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.075
No, you're not good.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.444
Alec has been busting
your balls all year, man.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.146
Yeah, which is why I just
had to stand up for myself.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.513
I got some mad
displaced anger

13:00.547 --> 13:02.082
because my parents
are making me go

13:02.115 --> 13:03.951
to Chestnut Hill Academy
next year.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.418
Dude, that sucks.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.719
Okay, enough.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.921
No more bonding.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.657
This burgeoning
friendship is over.
What?

13:10.690 --> 13:14.127
The moral of this story
cannot be that punching
solves problems.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.363
So, as the esteemed Head
of this School,

13:16.396 --> 13:19.632
I hereby declare that
you two are not friends.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.767
You can't do that.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.635
It's an unprecedented move,
sure,

13:22.669 --> 13:25.238
but (CHUCKLES)
my hands are tied.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.306
Back me up here, CB.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.807
Actually,
they do have a point.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.276
Don't need input.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.944
Just tell the children
they're dead to each other.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.713
You know what? They're not
the ones who need fixing.
It's you.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.182
Nice.
Dude!

13:35.215 --> 13:38.118
Reza Alavi is right.
Sometimes you just have to
stand up for yourself.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.219
Exactly.
Word.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.820
And if I let myself
get walked all over,

13:40.854 --> 13:42.422
then I deserve
everything you do to me.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.756
You're a (BLEEP)
and I'm tired of it.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.258
Boom.
This is the best day
of the year.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.659
Are you kidding me
right now?

13:46.693 --> 13:47.895
You're all over me
lately.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.596
You're picking on me.
You're taking my ideas.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.231
You're making me feel
like I'm the problem here.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.267
CB, honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.169
And that's
what makes it worse.
But you know what?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.471
I'm done. No more.
I'm done with you.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.974
By the way, Brad Pitt
is clearly Ed Norton's
imaginary friend.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.843
I watched it with
my 12-year-old nephew,
and he got it.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.178
He's a child.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.646
LAINEY: While CB
was done with John,

14:06.679 --> 14:08.982
my squad was ready
to cheer on the team

14:09.016 --> 14:10.417
at the biggest game
of the year.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.919
Coach Lewis, uh,

14:11.952 --> 14:13.820
it seems we got a little
situation brewing here.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.523
Oh, another coaching obstacle,
huh? Lay it on me.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.492
Well,
it's come to my attention
that the football players

14:19.526 --> 14:22.462
no longer
want the cheerleaders
on the team bus.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.498
Or cheering at all.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.633
What?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.767
You said you'd get them
on board.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.868
I know,
but it turns out

14:28.902 --> 14:30.537
they really like
their lockers decorated.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.973
Wait, are you saying they
don't want us to cheer at all?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.209
That's right.
We own the halftime show now.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.845
Oh, God.
We've been replaced by...

14:38.878 --> 14:39.947
Flag corps.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.348
Enjoy rolling up
to the game

14:41.381 --> 14:43.683
in your mom's
weak Pontiac Aztec, Harriet!

14:45.718 --> 14:48.055
(THUD)
Ugh, watch the pole.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.023
Just keep it straight.
No, you, like, flip it.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.358
Coach,
you have to stop this.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.960
The flag girls
are so jazzed.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.494
I can't take that
away from them.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.264
Look who's on
the bus now, bitches!
Great.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.067
We'd be on that bus
if we'd just kept things
the way they were.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.235
But now,
we've got nothing.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.703
We've got
a competition coming up.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.538
That's what cheerleading's
all about, right?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.208
Not flirting with
a bunch of football players
on the back of a bus.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.078
No! Thanks to you,
we don't even have
a team to cheer for,

15:11.111 --> 15:14.147
which means we're not even
cheerleaders at all.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.648
(SIGHS) Girls...

15:15.682 --> 15:19.386
Looks like we got ourselves
another coaching obstacle.
We'll figure this out.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.520
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:20.553 --> 15:22.689
No.
You figure it out.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.558
You may be a coach,
but I'm not.
(SCOFFS)

15:29.562 --> 15:31.264
Hey, C-to-the-B!

15:31.298 --> 15:33.100
It's me,
John Glascott.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.934
Can we have
a man-to-man talk?

15:34.968 --> 15:37.637
Not like boss and boss-ee
but more like friends?

15:37.670 --> 15:38.771
Of course.

15:38.805 --> 15:39.872
Okay,
here's the thing.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.609
John Glascott
is not a (BLEEP).
Take it back.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.377
I will not, 'cause that's
what you've been to me.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.745
How? Tell me.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.248
I demand to know
as your boss and also friend.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.449
Well, if you're
gonna make me say it,

15:49.482 --> 15:50.717
I think
you're jealous of me.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.287
Right, I'm jealous of a man
wearing a Snoopy tie.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.823
Actually, I like your tie.
It's fun.
Thanks.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.125
But what do I have
to be jealous about?

15:58.158 --> 15:59.959
'Cause I'm the teacher
that you used to be,

15:59.993 --> 16:01.661
and you
can't stand it, boss.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.895
Don't you dare
call me boss

16:02.929 --> 16:05.098
unless it's a pleasantry
between pals like,

16:05.132 --> 16:07.100
"Hey, I hope you had
a nice summer vacation, boss,"

16:07.134 --> 16:10.137
or "thanks for taking me
to that Dave Matthews
concert, boss."

16:10.170 --> 16:12.305
STUDENTS:
(CHANTING IN DISTANCE) Fight!
Oh, damn it, not again.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.307
I'll handle it.
Not if I can
handle it first!

16:16.276 --> 16:18.878
There is no fighting
at this school.
(CHANTING STOPS)

16:18.911 --> 16:20.647
Who is it?
Tell me right now.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.282
The two of you,
apparently.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.416
Us?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.817
Why would anyone
think that?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.486
Uh, because CB
called you a (BLEEP).

16:26.519 --> 16:28.521
What?
No, we don't have beef.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.123
I mean, we do,
a lot of it,

16:30.157 --> 16:31.724
but fighting
is not the answer.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
I just intercepted
a note in class.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.427
Has the fight
started yet?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.396
There is no fight!

16:36.429 --> 16:39.166
What adults do
is talk and listen.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.168
Violence solves nothing.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.636
Besides, I'm 20 years younger.
It wouldn't even be fair.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.737
Exactly.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.640
Given CB's youth
and lack of experience,

16:47.674 --> 16:50.177
things could get ugly
for him really quick,

16:50.210 --> 16:51.478
and we don't want that.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.545
Your principal is right.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.514
And to see me put
my judo training to use

16:54.547 --> 16:56.449
would make matters worse,
frankly.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.486
No worse than
me showing you
the art of capoeira...

16:59.519 --> 17:00.587
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

17:00.620 --> 17:02.855
...AKA
Brazilian dance fighting.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.292
Sure, I could flip your
principal into a trophy case,

17:05.325 --> 17:07.460
and glass
would rain down on him,

17:07.494 --> 17:08.861
but what
would that prove?

17:08.895 --> 17:09.962
Nothing!

17:09.996 --> 17:11.531
And not because
I would see it coming,

17:11.564 --> 17:13.600
I'd do a back flip
out of the way,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.702
kicking him in the forehead
as I land!

17:15.735 --> 17:17.937
Oh,
that's not possible.
You don't know!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.939
Oh, come on!

No!

Okay, come on.
This is crazy.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.653
I don't have it out
for you.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.423
You're one
of my favorite teachers,
and you know that.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.524
I used to.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.558
Not anymore.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.197
LAINEY: The football team
had won their game,

17:44.231 --> 17:46.833
but to Coach, it was
the worst loss of the season.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.835
Today was a total loss.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.470
Uh, but we just won.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.573
But you still lost
because you turned your back
on our cheer team.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.910
Coach, why are you sitting
in the locker room?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.079
Yeah, you only
just charge around

18:00.113 --> 18:01.848
all fired up,
throwing stuff.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.082
Not anymore, Weasel.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.185
This is on the cheerleaders
for thinking they're athletes.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.320
I'm sorry,
but they're not.

18:07.354 --> 18:10.590
Well,
if that's what you think,
then clean up.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.359
I'll be waiting for you
in the gym.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.461
It's simple.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.263
If you can do
just one basket toss,

18:16.296 --> 18:18.365
we'll all go back
to the way things were.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.866
I don't know
what a basket toss is,

18:19.899 --> 18:21.668
but if they can do it
wearing a skirt,

18:21.701 --> 18:23.102
I think
we'll be just fine.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.038
Ladies?

18:26.072 --> 18:28.208
Like Coach Lewis taught you.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.212
Let's see you do that!

18:32.245 --> 18:33.913
I can squat 350,
holmes.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.515
I don't think
it'll be a problem
to throw Weasel

18:35.548 --> 18:37.116
20 feet in the air.
Wait, what?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.251
I got your note.
What's going on?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.586
Just getting my boys
on board.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.354
Rick,
I appreciate the effort,

18:41.388 --> 18:43.223
but we both know
there is no way...

18:43.256 --> 18:44.357
On three!

18:44.391 --> 18:46.092
One, two,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.399
I'm so sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.202
So, yeah,
you're real athletes.
Big time.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.903
And we get it
if you never want
to cheer for us again

18:56.936 --> 18:58.205
after the way we've acted.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.907
Depends. Do you still want
the flag corps
to do the halftime show?

19:00.940 --> 19:01.974
Those girls are mean.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.543
And their giant sticks
are dangerous.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.745
Then looks like you just got
your cheerleaders back.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.846
Yes!

19:06.879 --> 19:07.947
Whoo!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.649
Welcome back, Coach.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.285
Just do me a favor
and no more quitting.
Deal.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.287
And don't worry. We'll make
you proud at regionals.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.122
And we'll be right there
cheering you on.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.257

a new tradition.

so well last time.

you were right, CB.

Why?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.508
It's so hard watching you
with those kids,

19:35.542 --> 19:37.244
being the one
that they depend on.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.947
That used to be me,
and back then,
I was so happy.

what I feel.

to a budgeting meeting.

Great.

Hey, you know, um,
just 'cause you're
head of the school now

19:53.059 --> 19:54.961
doesn't mean you can't still
be in the trenches.

are so crazy,

if that's possible.

that they grow
and change, too.

they've got their coworkers

So, you and Alec Raday
really got in this fight.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.949

I did not.

How long
did this fight last?

20:52.785 --> 20:54.587
REZA: You know,
it seemed like forever,

20:54.621 --> 20:55.888
but it was probably
10 seconds.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.357
Did he really
pull that hockey move

20:57.390 --> 20:59.025
where he pulled your shirt
over your head?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.092
Yeah, he did.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.494
What did your parents say
about the fight?

21:01.528 --> 21:03.095
Of course I didn't tell them
about the fight

21:03.129 --> 21:04.697
so they'll learn
from this TV show,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.499
but he did
step on my glasses,

21:06.533 --> 21:09.569

with some story
why I needed new glasses.

of fond memories of CB.
Yeah.

He was my swim coach.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.911

to make something

head underwater for
