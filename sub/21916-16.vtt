00:05.369 --> 00:08.295
Previously on Mystery Inc...

00:08.415 --> 00:10.453
The whole planispheric disc!

00:10.573 --> 00:12.756
I've *** together a rudimentary player

00:12.876 --> 00:14.264
for the planispheric disc.

00:14.384 --> 00:16.866
The sooner we find out
what this is supposed to do,

00:16.986 --> 00:19.202
the sooner we'll solve
the mystery of the *** treasure.

00:19.322 --> 00:20.528
Nibiru!

00:20.648 --> 00:21.724
Jeepers, Fred.

00:21.844 --> 00:24.104
You're living in a van, down by the river.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.373
I didn't have much choice.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.413
My folks got have 20 spare
bedrooms in the house

00:27.523 --> 00:29.886
and I'm sure if you moved in,
they wouldn't even notice!

00:30.596 --> 00:32.533
You and I should be okay in here.

00:32.653 --> 00:34.587
Nibiru has come!

00:34.707 --> 00:36.485
This has all happened before!

00:36.605 --> 00:38.332
It begins with the animal.

00:38.452 --> 00:40.334
The dog dies.

00:40.454 --> 00:43.000
Is he talking about me?

00:44.625 --> 00:47.173
If each of the pieces reveals a location,

00:47.293 --> 00:50.056
then all of the pieces together
should show us the treasure.

00:50.446 --> 00:51.382
Jeepers!

00:51.502 --> 00:53.398
It could be a cache of diamonds!

00:53.518 --> 00:54.438
In a gold trap!

00:54.558 --> 00:56.089
Covered in hot fudge!

00:56.209 --> 00:58.273
Like, wrapped in a burrito!

00:58.834 --> 01:01.226
What would be your opinion, Nova?

01:04.964 --> 01:06.131
Hmm?

01:09.235 --> 01:12.356
Jinkies, look at this, gang.

01:16.755 --> 01:19.499
"Senor P. Llave."

01:19.567 --> 01:21.369
Like, what kind
of name is that?

01:23.326 --> 01:25.491
And what's the deal
with the numbers?

01:25.559 --> 01:27.296
Maybe the numbers
are more coordinates.

01:27.364 --> 01:29.526
This could be the ultimate
treasure destination.

01:29.593 --> 01:32.152
We should be ready
to expect anything.

01:33.186 --> 01:34.947
You have to help me!

01:35.015 --> 01:36.511
Sheriff? What's wrong?

01:36.579 --> 01:38.579
We're in the middle
of a full-scale galactic war,

01:38.643 --> 01:40.981
and the earth is the prize.

02:11.357 --> 02:14.927
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

02:22.700 --> 02:26.302
Recently, these memories
came flooding back to me.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.637
I was 14, home alone,

02:28.704 --> 02:30.905
doing what all kids did
when their mom was gone...

02:30.973 --> 02:33.273
rifle through her drawers
looking for old candy

02:33.341 --> 02:36.141
and a used lipstick container
I could store my baby teeth in.

02:36.209 --> 02:38.076
Don't act like you never did it.

02:38.143 --> 02:39.310
- No.
- Never.

02:39.377 --> 02:40.810
Creepy.

02:40.878 --> 02:45.980
Anyway, there I was
late one night in the closet

02:46.048 --> 02:48.316
playing "dead justice"

02:48.384 --> 02:51.385
and pretending to fight
Nitro Wisinski,

02:51.453 --> 02:53.620
when I heard something
otherworldly

02:53.688 --> 02:56.290
coming from outside.

03:01.828 --> 03:03.428
And then all of a sudden,

03:03.496 --> 03:05.163
this bright light appeared
from outside.

03:05.231 --> 03:06.665
I felt a presence in the room.

03:06.732 --> 03:10.767
I was paralyzed,
and then it came for me.

03:10.835 --> 03:13.336
What came for you?

03:13.404 --> 03:16.138
- An E.B.E.
- An ebe?

03:16.205 --> 03:18.006
No, an E.B.E....

03:18.074 --> 03:20.608
an extraterrestrial
biological entity,

03:20.676 --> 03:23.777
an alien being
from far beyond the stars,

03:23.845 --> 03:26.012
a gray.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.513
- A gray what?
- A gray alien!

03:28.581 --> 03:30.314
You know, those dinky,
little bodies;

03:30.382 --> 03:34.218
great, big heads;
Smooth, hairless skin.

03:34.286 --> 03:37.587
Aren't you people
paying attention?

03:37.654 --> 03:40.423
So, like, you were
abducted by an alien.

03:40.490 --> 03:44.660
You could've just said that.
It would've been much clearer.

03:44.727 --> 03:47.428
Oh, thanks for the tip,
mushmouth.

03:49.164 --> 03:51.532
Enough, you two.
Continue, sheriff.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.731
As I was trying to say...

03:56.267 --> 04:00.436
They took me to their saucer and
put a chip in my nasal cavity

04:00.504 --> 04:03.037
so they could track me
and steal my memories

04:03.105 --> 04:05.706
and make me do awful things.

04:07.342 --> 04:09.209
What kinds of awful things?

04:09.277 --> 04:12.112
Awful things! Awful!

04:12.179 --> 04:14.614
Like, all right.
All right. We get it.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.415
Awful things.

04:16.483 --> 04:18.283
Have you told anyone else
about this,

04:18.351 --> 04:20.418
like maybe a licensed
psychiatric professional?

04:20.486 --> 04:22.654
Ooh, you don't believe me?

04:22.721 --> 04:25.389
Well, take a look at this.

04:27.926 --> 04:31.061
You were abducted
by a teeth-whitening kiosk?

04:31.129 --> 04:34.463
What? Oh, that little,
gray beast, he was right there!

04:34.531 --> 04:38.332
Rrgh, they're so crafty.
I need your help!

04:38.400 --> 04:42.368
I'm obviously desperate,
which I why I came

04:42.436 --> 04:49.073
to 4 child detectives
and their talking dog for help.

04:49.141 --> 04:52.509
Now, we must be vigilant.
They're very advanced.

04:52.577 --> 04:55.712
Hang on, gang.
Check out that store.

04:55.779 --> 04:57.881
Sheriff, this might be
a good time

04:57.948 --> 04:59.983
for you to do some sheriffing.

05:03.153 --> 05:06.855
Hello, not-real
law enforcementers.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.856
I'm sheriff Bronson stone.

05:08.924 --> 05:10.491
This is a minor theft, sheriff,

05:10.558 --> 05:12.426
some high-tech GPS
thingamajigger.

05:12.494 --> 05:14.394
We're gonna check out
the security footage

05:14.462 --> 05:16.996
if you want to tag along.

05:23.738 --> 05:26.342
Ooh! It's a gray. Hide me.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.779
I don't know, sheriff.

05:27.846 --> 05:29.848
It kind of looks like
a kid in a sweatshirt.

05:29.915 --> 05:31.449
There's another one.

05:31.517 --> 05:35.120
Holy battle beyond the stars,
it's a Nordic alien!

05:35.188 --> 05:38.790
Or a woman holding a newspaper
in front of her face.

05:38.858 --> 05:41.725
Don't be fooled
by their Nordic good looks

05:41.793 --> 05:43.660
and peaceful demeanors, girlie.

05:43.728 --> 05:47.131
Then, like, what's that?

05:47.199 --> 05:51.201
A lutoid, shape shifters
from Alpha Draconis.

05:51.269 --> 05:54.938
We're being invaded
from all sides!

06:00.778 --> 06:04.714
While some call the Nordic
aliens our space brothers,

06:04.782 --> 06:07.717
the less nitwitted among us,
by which I mean me,

06:07.784 --> 06:09.452
know why they're really here,

06:09.519 --> 06:11.887
and that is to conquer
and enslave us.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.955
Is that why the lizard aliens
came here, too?

06:14.023 --> 06:16.490
No. The reptoids
are already here

06:16.558 --> 06:18.225
living in the middle
of our planet

06:18.293 --> 06:20.260
in a sanctuary
called hollow earth.

06:20.328 --> 06:24.463
- Huh?
- Oh, for the love of...

06:24.531 --> 06:26.933
- Wh-what was that?
- Jinkies.

06:29.303 --> 06:31.571
Like, it's coming back.

06:31.639 --> 06:33.040
Oh!

06:34.642 --> 06:36.410
Mommy.

06:42.517 --> 06:44.485
Huh?

06:50.292 --> 06:53.592
Gang, prepare yourselves.
I think we're about to be...

06:53.659 --> 06:55.191
Abducted.

06:55.259 --> 06:58.460
Ohh! Ohh!

06:58.528 --> 07:00.529
Waah...

07:06.568 --> 07:09.003
Ah.

07:10.573 --> 07:13.941
Aah!

07:14.009 --> 07:16.510
Stupid, stupid corn!

07:20.181 --> 07:22.381
Get out of my way, corn!

07:26.686 --> 07:31.690
Weak. Need cheeseburger.

07:31.757 --> 07:35.226
Somebody, like, help.

07:35.294 --> 07:39.796
Huh? Yaah!

07:39.864 --> 07:41.164
Zoinks!

07:41.232 --> 07:42.632
Yaah!

07:42.700 --> 07:45.501
- Aah!
- Whoa!

07:50.909 --> 07:53.544
If this is where
sheriff Bronson stone

07:53.612 --> 07:57.574
makes his last stand,
then so be it.

08:06.693 --> 08:10.562
You can't have me,
you alien freaks!

08:11.730 --> 08:14.531
Waah! Aah aah aah!

08:14.599 --> 08:15.832
Uh...

08:15.900 --> 08:17.334
Like, sheriff?

08:18.436 --> 08:21.036
Shaggy? Scooby?

08:21.104 --> 08:23.371
Guys, a path.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.541
Who cuts down corn
from the middle out?

08:27.609 --> 08:29.342
Corn trap artists.

08:29.410 --> 08:32.712
It's not a path.
It's a circle, a crop circle.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.313
A bright, moving light;
the Mystery Machine dies;

08:35.381 --> 08:37.115
the radio; a crop circle?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.517
I hate to say it, but...

08:38.585 --> 08:40.352
There really are aliens
among us.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.620
So what do we do?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.222
First, we need to find
the others.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.357
After that, I know someone
who can help us,

08:45.425 --> 08:48.527
although I'm sure I'm going
to regret asking her.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.062
Alien invasion?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.564
Oh, sweetie, you have no idea
how happy this makes me.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.968
You finally believe.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.771
I told you I was going
to regret this.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.821
Velma has always poo-pooed
my little hobby...

09:08.882 --> 09:10.115
Obsession.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.151
But I knew
she'd come around some day.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.754
You know, the government
formed a secret agency

09:14.821 --> 09:17.523
called Majestic 12 to deal
with the alien menace.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.258
They focus mainly on grays.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.593
No matter
how many letters I write,

09:20.660 --> 09:22.661
they still neglect
the reptoid threat.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.165
I suspect the government
has a secret treaty

09:25.232 --> 09:26.533
with hollow earth.

09:26.601 --> 09:28.535
It is scientifically impossible

09:28.603 --> 09:30.337
for the center of the earth
to be hollow,

09:30.405 --> 09:33.206
much less for bipedal reptiles
to be living in it.

09:33.274 --> 09:35.909
When convention and science
offer us no answers,

09:35.977 --> 09:39.679
might we not finally turn to
the fantastic as a plausibility?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.516
Do you know that most people
who claim to have seen a UFO

09:42.583 --> 09:45.118
have really just seen
the planet Venus?

09:45.186 --> 09:47.226
Mrs. Dinkley, do you
really think you can help us?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.787
Certainly, dear.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.622
With the arrival
of the Nordic aliens,

09:50.690 --> 09:52.591
the reptoids have ventured
above ground.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.294
I suspect that the grays
are stealing technology

09:55.361 --> 09:56.962
to repair their ship.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.398
Now, sheriff, you are obviously
the key to everything.

09:59.465 --> 10:02.101
The item in your nasal cavity
is both controlling you

10:02.168 --> 10:03.736
and repressing your memories.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.406
I knew it! Is that bad?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.375
Very, but as I have been
trained by Dr. Vieber,

10:09.443 --> 10:11.944
the master of abduction
regression hypnosis,

10:12.012 --> 10:13.913
I believe I can help.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.382
Please raise
your right hand, dear.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.190
Now, don't be frightened,
sheriff.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.459
I won't make you quack like
a duck or flap your arms.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.628
- Quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Quack, quack, quack, quack.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.931
Huh?

10:31.998 --> 10:33.432
So susceptible.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.935
Curious the aliens didn't abduct
the two of you.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.172
Hmm. Now, sheriff,
keep your eyes on the watch.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.575
Breathe deeply in and out.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.645
Ahh...

10:47.148 --> 10:48.481
Yuck.

10:48.549 --> 10:51.251
Like, you said it, bud. Eww.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.454
Now, dear, tell me
about the light.

10:54.522 --> 10:56.960
They come to me over the years.

10:57.028 --> 10:58.996
I knew I'd been
repeatedly probed,

10:59.064 --> 11:01.465
but I had no memory of it.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.267
Then one night...

11:16.444 --> 11:19.713
And then what happened, dear?

11:19.780 --> 11:24.317
I was trapped
in its creepy alien light.

11:24.384 --> 11:28.054
They took me to their ship and
replaced the chip in my schnoz

11:28.121 --> 11:31.523
with something even bigger.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.124
Did they say anything?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.359
Aliens usually give away
their odious intentions

11:35.427 --> 11:37.026
while their victim
is helpless on the table.

11:37.094 --> 11:39.494
Well, they said...

11:39.562 --> 11:43.230
they said my brain
will keep the plans safe.

11:43.298 --> 11:44.698
What plans?

11:44.766 --> 11:46.934
The plans that will
take them back home.

11:47.002 --> 11:52.206
The aliens need my brain!
They're gonna steal my brain!

11:52.274 --> 11:54.340
Must not be
very complicated plans.

11:56.209 --> 11:58.042
What was that?

11:59.611 --> 12:01.712
Look. The space kook is missing.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.047
No, it's not. Like,
I think it's right over there.

12:04.115 --> 12:06.416
Look out.

12:06.483 --> 12:08.051
- Oh!
- Oh!

12:08.118 --> 12:11.153
Get her before she gets away.

12:11.221 --> 12:12.855
After her. Oh!

12:12.922 --> 12:14.823
Whoa!

12:14.891 --> 12:16.992
Uh!

12:19.096 --> 12:20.997
Aliens drive Winnebagos?

12:21.065 --> 12:24.734
Like I said, dear, they've
been here a long, long time.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.435
They want my brain.

12:26.503 --> 12:30.505
You have to protect my brain.

12:33.274 --> 12:36.075
You'll be safe here tonight,
sheriff.

12:36.143 --> 12:38.244
You can room with me.
You a side or back sleeper?

12:38.312 --> 12:39.979
Because I got this great
body pillow you can borrow.

12:40.046 --> 12:43.281
I don't need
some silly body pillow!

12:43.349 --> 12:46.082
But I am gonna miss
my footie PJs.

12:46.150 --> 12:48.451
While you guys are having
your little sleepover,

12:48.518 --> 12:51.453
Scooby, shaggy, and I have
some investigating to do.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.689
Will you take nova
for the night?

12:54.756 --> 12:56.957
You're investigating
without us?

12:57.025 --> 12:59.059
There better not be
a trap involved.

12:59.127 --> 13:01.293
Like, no trap, just a hunch.

13:04.762 --> 13:09.230
Mom, dad, I'm home.
It's only me, no one else.

13:09.298 --> 13:12.466
Honey, come see my new toy.

13:13.368 --> 13:16.436
It's a car in the dining room.

13:16.503 --> 13:19.138
I had to get rid of that flat,
wooden thing, of course.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.540
What's it called,
love of my life?

13:21.608 --> 13:23.075
A table, darling.

13:23.142 --> 13:24.709
Oh, yeah, a table.

13:24.777 --> 13:28.113
Ah, the Pangaea looks
much better here.

13:28.180 --> 13:30.448
It's named after
an energy-efficient continent.

13:30.516 --> 13:33.150
I feel greener
and more European already.

13:34.686 --> 13:36.219
Hello? Barty Blake here.

13:36.287 --> 13:37.987
Ah, Mr. Blake,
I was just checking

13:38.055 --> 13:39.555
on the delivery
of your automobile.

13:39.623 --> 13:40.956
Did it, perhaps, arrive safely?

13:41.024 --> 13:42.390
Oh, it sure did.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.325
It's right here
in my dining room.

13:44.393 --> 13:46.260
And what more perfect place
could there be?

13:46.328 --> 13:47.795
Enjoy the car, sir.

13:47.862 --> 13:52.032
Such wonderful
customer service.

13:55.804 --> 13:59.272
That dog is so happy,
it makes my teeth hurt,

13:59.340 --> 14:03.041
although that could be caused
by the chip in my nasal cavity.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.442
There's nothing
more awesome than love,

14:05.510 --> 14:07.578
well, except for traps.

14:07.645 --> 14:10.013
I remember what it was like
to feel love for somebody.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.748
It was like some amazonian
river fish

14:12.816 --> 14:14.750
had laid eggs in my chest

14:14.818 --> 14:16.986
and they all started
to hatch at once.

14:17.054 --> 14:20.089
- That's disgusting.
- That's love.

14:20.157 --> 14:24.426
Well, even with my brain,
it's hard enough to keep up

14:24.493 --> 14:27.194
with Mayor Nettles,
and if the aliens take it,

14:27.262 --> 14:30.364
then, why, I won't even be able
to fake knowing things

14:30.432 --> 14:32.767
like her first name
and how she likes her bacon cut

14:32.834 --> 14:34.802
into little heart-shaped
chunklets.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.037
Huh?

14:36.105 --> 14:38.306
You have to help me
keep my brain.

14:38.374 --> 14:39.774
You can count
on Mystery Incorporated

14:39.842 --> 14:41.142
to save your brain, sheriff.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.711
Now let's get some sleep.

14:43.779 --> 14:45.847
- Mm...
- Mm...

14:45.914 --> 14:47.882
Ah...

15:01.148 --> 15:04.778
I chased that idiot sheriff
off me property the other day.

15:04.898 --> 15:07.033
He was rooting
through the garbage cans,

15:07.101 --> 15:09.269
said he was looking for clues,

15:09.336 --> 15:12.171
but when I aimed
Nelly here at him,

15:12.239 --> 15:14.674
he skittered away
like a crayfish

15:14.742 --> 15:16.509
right back to the mainland,

15:16.577 --> 15:18.511
his arms full of rotten,
day-old clams

15:18.579 --> 15:20.814
that had been sitting
in the sun too long.

15:20.881 --> 15:22.516
Thanks, skipper.
That's helpful.

15:22.584 --> 15:25.552
Shaggy! Help!

15:47.377 --> 15:51.480
Mm...mm...

16:14.912 --> 16:16.579
Like, where should we look?

16:17.915 --> 16:20.917
Ugh! Bad smell. Bad smell.

16:23.588 --> 16:26.256
Like, smelly pens?

16:28.226 --> 16:32.063
Like, for the first time ever,
I'm not hungry.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.698
Me, neither.

16:33.766 --> 16:37.068
We've solved half the mystery.
As for the other half...

16:37.136 --> 16:39.003
jinkies, that's it.

16:39.071 --> 16:41.472
Weren't there 3 mysterious
figures at the mall?

16:41.540 --> 16:43.775
Boys, we've cracked
this mystery wide open.

16:43.843 --> 16:45.377
Like, we have?

16:45.444 --> 16:46.744
We will have after I make
some phone calls

16:46.812 --> 16:48.380
to the power company
and the army.

16:48.447 --> 16:51.115
Let's get the gang.

17:00.327 --> 17:04.230
Hey, what's going on?
Who's revving my baby?

17:05.964 --> 17:09.598
My car! My beautiful Pangaea!

17:15.804 --> 17:17.472
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh!

17:20.842 --> 17:22.008
Get in.

17:24.412 --> 17:26.878
My brain.
They almost got my brain.

17:26.946 --> 17:30.682
Hold on, everyone.
It's trapping time.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.597
- Ooh! Whoa!
- Ooh!

17:49.746 --> 17:51.847
Don't get too close.

17:51.914 --> 17:54.749
They still might have some
alien brain-stealing items

17:54.817 --> 17:56.151
ready to deploy.

17:56.219 --> 17:57.987
That might be true
if they were really aliens,

17:58.055 --> 18:00.560
but they are, in fact,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.621
traveler O'Flaherty,

18:03.027 --> 18:05.162
Sheila O'Flaherty,

18:05.230 --> 18:07.198
and Conor O'Flaherty.

18:07.266 --> 18:09.401
Usually, we all
recognize the villain

18:09.469 --> 18:11.069
and shout out his name
in unison.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.405
Yeah, Velm. Mind cluing us in?

18:13.473 --> 18:16.042
I know all the criminals
in crystal cove,

18:16.109 --> 18:18.143
and these jerks
aren't ringing a bell.

18:18.211 --> 18:20.546
Like, you had a wanted poster
for them on your wall.

18:20.613 --> 18:23.515
Oh, please. Nobody ever
pays attention to those.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.753
What is this, the old west?

18:25.821 --> 18:27.321
Were that it were, boyo.

18:27.389 --> 18:30.091
Then perhaps we could've earned
an honest living.

18:30.159 --> 18:31.459
When I was a wee lad,

18:31.527 --> 18:34.560
we couldn't even afford
peat for our fire.

18:34.628 --> 18:38.330
So I had to lift it.

18:38.397 --> 18:40.397
It turned out,
I was a right good thief,

18:40.465 --> 18:42.465
but then I discovered
there were things I could steal

18:42.533 --> 18:45.734
other than coal,
and, wouldn't you know it,

18:45.802 --> 18:49.972
my kids had an aptitude for
the family business, as well.

18:53.143 --> 18:55.878
We started getting a reputation
for our business,

18:55.946 --> 18:59.683
and there were our faces
splashed all over the universe.

18:59.751 --> 19:02.954
Aye. 'Twas then we got
the idea for the costumes

19:03.022 --> 19:05.257
because who'd ever say they saw
an outer space creature

19:05.325 --> 19:08.360
stealing a flat-screen
television set?

19:08.428 --> 19:11.197
I found out about the Blakes
purchasing the Pangaea.

19:11.264 --> 19:12.831
Seemed like it was
right up our alley,

19:12.899 --> 19:14.419
and we'd have gotten away
with it, too,

19:14.467 --> 19:16.936
if it weren't for you
frittering snappers.

19:18.105 --> 19:20.206
Meddling kids!

19:20.273 --> 19:22.475
But I know what I saw...
the aliens,

19:22.542 --> 19:24.376
the cornfield, my nose chip.

19:24.444 --> 19:26.946
Actually, sheriff,
during your hypnotic regression,

19:27.014 --> 19:29.749
shaggy and Scooby smelled
something on your breath.

19:29.816 --> 19:31.283
- Bad clams.
- Bad clams.

19:31.351 --> 19:32.985
The clams induced
a hallucination

19:33.053 --> 19:34.821
that made everything seem real.

19:34.888 --> 19:36.556
What about the lights
on the road?

19:36.624 --> 19:38.658
A weather balloon
that got loose from the army.

19:38.725 --> 19:40.326
And the Mystery Machine
fritzing out?

19:40.393 --> 19:42.461
Too many people turning on
their air conditioners

19:42.529 --> 19:45.064
at the same time created
an electromagnetic pulse

19:45.132 --> 19:47.300
that shut the Mystery Machine's
engine down.

19:47.368 --> 19:48.668
The crop circle?

19:48.736 --> 19:50.136
A farmer writing, "I love you"

19:50.204 --> 19:51.871
to his wife
for their anniversary.

19:51.938 --> 19:54.906
Aw, we must've been standing
in the "O" of "love."

19:54.974 --> 19:56.841
Or the "O" of "you."

19:56.909 --> 19:58.442
It was the "O" of "love," Fred.

19:58.510 --> 20:02.079
So I wasn't repeatedly abducted

20:02.147 --> 20:03.947
and experimented on by aliens?

20:04.015 --> 20:05.748
Doesn't seem so, sheriff.

20:05.816 --> 20:09.018
Then I'm no longer a victim,
and you, O'Flaherty family,

20:09.086 --> 20:11.087
are under arrest for thievery

20:11.155 --> 20:13.290
and impersonation
of invaders from outer space,

20:13.358 --> 20:17.428
and you're going away
for a long, long time.

20:17.496 --> 20:19.630
We still have
one big mystery to solve...

20:19.698 --> 20:21.432
the planispheric disc.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.201
I took the liberty
of punching in the coordinates

20:23.268 --> 20:25.303
into the Mystery Machine's GPS.

20:25.371 --> 20:28.673
Gang, we're heading
for Gatorsburg.

20:36.213 --> 20:38.180
This is the place.

20:50.595 --> 20:52.696
I found something.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.835
"Senor Primero Llave."

20:57.903 --> 21:01.305
"Primero" means first
in Spanish, and "llave" is key.

21:01.372 --> 21:04.041
Then maybe there some kind
of key in the coffin.

21:04.109 --> 21:06.812
Scoob, you feel
like digging, pal?

21:06.879 --> 21:09.916
Why do I always
have to dig up the graves?

21:09.984 --> 21:13.319
I just washed my paws.

21:23.264 --> 21:25.599
It's empty.

21:27.435 --> 21:30.605
Not quite.

21:30.673 --> 21:33.475
Like, what does an old gun
have to do with a key?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.511
No idea, shag, but we're
not gonna figure it out here.

21:36.579 --> 21:38.013
I say we head back to...

21:38.081 --> 21:40.749
Our office!

21:40.817 --> 21:42.618
What happened?

21:42.685 --> 21:44.453
No idea. It's a mystery.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.921
Good thing nobody was inside.

21:45.988 --> 21:48.790
Somebody could've gotten
really hurt.
