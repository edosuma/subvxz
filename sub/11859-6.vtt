WEBVTT

00:38.875 --> 00:41.625
Hey, got any glazed
in there, Donna?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.959
You got any fries
with that shake, baby?

00:43.041 --> 00:44.250
That's funny, Bruce.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.792
I just heard a guy
say that..

00:45.875 --> 00:48.291
...to your mother
at the drive-thru window.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.000
Oh, yeah?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.458
Alright, listen up.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.959
End of the month,
fellas.
Crunch time.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.125
Gotta move some serious steel

00:57.208 --> 00:58.792
before the new
inventory arrives.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.917
Top man on the board..

01:02.500 --> 01:04.625
...gets a fat bonus,
$1,500 cash.

01:04.709 --> 01:06.917
'Bottom fish? You don't sell
a car this weekend..'

01:07.000 --> 01:09.083
[blows raspberry]
...hit the bricks.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.750
Or you can get out now.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.792
'It's simple, men.'

01:14.875 --> 01:18.291
Get...them...
in...the car.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.875
Get 'em to, to smell it.

01:21.959 --> 01:23.792
Then you get 'em to drive it.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.625
Then you get 'em to buy it!

01:26.709 --> 01:28.458
The feel of the wheel..

01:29.834 --> 01:30.917
...seals the deal!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.458
The feel of the wheel.

01:32.542 --> 01:35.458
Rice burners got us beat
on price and mileage, Mickey.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.333
Yeah, we're busting
our humps out there

01:37.417 --> 01:39.250
but we're losing
loyal customers

01:39.333 --> 01:41.375
'with these new, uh,
K-cars.'

01:41.458 --> 01:43.500
The cars?

01:43.583 --> 01:45.875
The cars don't lose customers.

01:45.959 --> 01:47.500
Lousy salesman do!

01:48.750 --> 01:50.500
You think guys walk on this lot

01:50.583 --> 01:52.959
because they're thinking
about mileage?

01:53.041 --> 01:54.166
Guys walk on this lot

01:54.250 --> 01:56.333
because they wanna
buy American.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.667
'To give us their money.'

01:57.750 --> 01:59.500
And you know what you do?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.291
You take it, damn it!

02:01.375 --> 02:02.583
Take it!

02:02.667 --> 02:05.458
People want cars
to project an image.

02:05.542 --> 02:10.333
Cars to make 'em...
look younger or more powerful.

02:10.417 --> 02:13.583
'Men want cars
that women just wanna..'

02:15.208 --> 02:16.250
...get into.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.875
Ain't that right, Donna?

02:18.959 --> 02:21.333
Yeah, but I would have never
got knocked up at 17

02:21.417 --> 02:23.166
in some K-car.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.667
It ain't go no curves,
no back seat.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.583
Never take no
for an answer!

02:29.667 --> 02:30.917
'Someone says
they're just looking?'

02:31.000 --> 02:32.875
You tell 'em that's how
you met your wife.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.959
What-what if they say they
have
to check with the wife?

02:35.041 --> 02:37.500
Then you tell 'em to go get
their pants back!

02:37.583 --> 02:40.875
You get 'em in a box
and you close these bastards!

02:40.959 --> 02:44.250
And if you can't do it,
then you find someone who can!

02:44.333 --> 02:46.750
But you do not...
and I repeat..

02:46.834 --> 02:51.250
...you do not let them walk
out that door!

02:51.333 --> 02:52.709
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.458
- Are we clear?
- Yeah!

02:54.542 --> 02:58.125
Shall we go sell some cars?
Let's go sell some cars.

03:00.709 --> 03:04.041
Mickey! Mickey! Mickey!
Can I talk to you a sec?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.750
The phones aren't gonna answer
themselves, sweetheart.

03:05.834 --> 03:09.083
I know, it's just, um, things
are real tight for me right
now.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.083
- Oh, looking for an advance?
- Just for this week.

03:11.166 --> 03:14.959
- But I'm ready to take on
more.
- That's great.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.709
I'll tell you,
why don't you start by, uh..

03:16.792 --> 03:18.834
...cleaning this mess up
right here?

03:18.917 --> 03:21.834
Look at it,
pigsty right here. Look.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.417
(John)
'Classic car buff trolling
for parts found more'

03:54.500 --> 03:57.291
than he bargained for
in the trunk of this old
beater.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.500
Adult female?

03:58.583 --> 04:01.125
Looks like blunt force
trauma to the skull.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.166
'The tire iron
was in the trunk.'

04:05.709 --> 04:07.625
It's a '73 Eldorado.

04:07.709 --> 04:10.208
Guy probably wanted
the taillights.

04:10.291 --> 04:14.458
Donna D'Amico, age 22,
went missing back in '81.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.959
Anyone notify next of kin?

04:16.041 --> 04:17.375
(John)
'We're trying
to locate her mother'

04:17.458 --> 04:20.333
'who filed
the missing persons report.'

04:20.417 --> 04:24.333
The car don't belong to her.
The keys don't fit.

04:24.417 --> 04:26.959
And the VIN number
plate's gone.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.333
A '73.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.583
Cars had confidential
VIN numbers that far
back?

04:30.667 --> 04:32.250
Should be buried
in there somewhere.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.166
It's probably on the frame
or under the engine block.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.834
Whoever dumped her knew
what they were doing.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.250
The fat slob
at the gate said

04:38.333 --> 04:39.667
they don't inspect cars
at intake.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.792
The place should
advertise to criminals

04:41.875 --> 04:43.166
Dump-Jobs-R-Us.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.041
Let's tow the car. Let the
Auto
Squad

04:45.125 --> 04:46.625
take it apart in the garage.

04:49.583 --> 04:50.834
(Scotty)
'What is it?'

04:50.917 --> 04:54.875
A scrap of paper with
some names and some numbers.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.166
Still make out the ballpoint.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.875
"Lester, 1200 bucks."

05:00.959 --> 05:02.083
Somebody she owed money?

05:02.166 --> 05:03.583
The address at the top's
faded out.

05:03.667 --> 05:04.917
See if QD can
pull it up?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.709
I'll run the name Lester
against titles

05:06.792 --> 05:09.083
on '73 Eldorados.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.750
Donna's mother passed away
eight years ago.

05:10.834 --> 05:15.667
Only surviving next of kin
is her daughter, Marisa.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.041
How old was she back in '81

05:18.125 --> 05:19.458
when her mom disappeared?

05:19.542 --> 05:21.041
Five.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.375
I'll handle
the notification.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.000
It was a good thing we got
to her before the crusher.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.250
Donna D'Amico, 22-year-old
single mom took the bus

06:12.333 --> 06:13.959
to Steed Motors where
she worked as a greeter.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.583
Boss says she left at 7:00
P.M.
the day she disappeared.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.792
Never returned to pick up
her daughter from the
sitter.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.458
Witness statements back in '81?

06:20.542 --> 06:22.875
Nothing indicating foul
play.
Like she vanished.

06:22.959 --> 06:25.959
Only after she emptied
her bank account, 400 bucks.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.125
Any guys
in the picture?

06:27.208 --> 06:29.375
No husband, no degree..

06:29.458 --> 06:32.500
bad credit, crap job
with limited
prospects.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.208
(Will)
'Assigned figured
she skipped town'

06:34.291 --> 06:35.709
ditched the kid
and a miserable situation.

06:35.792 --> 06:36.834
(Nick)
'Wouldn't be the first.'

06:36.917 --> 06:38.041
We got any other friends
or family?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.625
(Will)
'Friend Paula coming in.'

06:39.709 --> 06:41.667
She was sitting the kid
the night she disappeared.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.333
- What about the daughter?
- Marisa D'Amico.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.291
She's not returning our phone
calls. Rush is hunting her
down.

06:45.375 --> 06:48.458
Checked registrations
on all '73 Eldorados.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.000
No hits
on the name Lester.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.250
Check the dealership.
See if there ever was a guy

06:52.333 --> 06:55.166
that name worked
on that lot.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.125
I hate car salesman.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.583
You could use
a new ride.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.542
What's wrong
with my car?

07:01.625 --> 07:03.458
Nothing, if you
like
being single.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.792
- Excuse me, is that Marisa?
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.709
Marisa?
Lily
Rush.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.959
I've called before
about your mother.

07:19.792 --> 07:23.000
My mother walked out
when I was five.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.208
We just
found
her body.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.000
Where?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.917
In the trunk of a car
out in Elmwood.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.083
Might explain
what happened to her.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.917
Can't say it's a real shock.
given her choice in men.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.375
Anyone in particular?

07:43.458 --> 07:44.959
I was referring
to the loser

07:45.041 --> 07:47.208
who knocked her up
in high school.

07:47.291 --> 07:48.500
Your dad.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.125
Got to be around
to earn that title.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.375
- Never even met him.
- Who'd you grow up with?

07:52.458 --> 07:55.792
Grandmother raised me...
who wasn't expecting to.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.125
'Reminded me constantly.'

07:57.208 --> 07:59.208
I know you were young,
but if there's

07:59.291 --> 08:01.375
'anything you can remember
about your mom'

08:01.458 --> 08:02.875
'what she was
involved in..'

08:02.959 --> 08:05.375
Only thing I remember
was we never had any money

08:05.458 --> 08:06.834
'or a place of our own.'

08:06.917 --> 08:08.417
The name Lester
mean something to you?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.792
No.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.333
Did she leave anything behind,
personal effects?

08:12.417 --> 08:14.458
Sorry, all I know is
the police said

08:14.542 --> 08:15.834
she cleaned out
her bank account.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.709
Couldn't get away fast enough.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.792
You think of
anything,
let me know.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.750
Always knew something
must have happened.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.917
Donna never would have
just taken off.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.542
She loved that kid.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.375
You were babysitting Marisa
the night she disappeared?

08:35.458 --> 08:37.208
'We were good friends
in high school.'

08:37.291 --> 08:39.250
Dodged a baby bullet myself.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.625
'Figured I'd help her out
whenever I could.'

08:41.709 --> 08:44.542
Any guys she was
involved with at the time?

08:44.625 --> 08:48.000
Dating was a hassle for
her,
the kid and all.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.667
She was really
struggling
to make it on her own.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.750
Any idea why she
emptied her bank account

08:52.834 --> 08:53.917
before she disappeared?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.750
No, but it couldn't
have
been much.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.083
Donna didn't have two nickels.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.250
She owe anybody?
Someone named Lester?

09:00.333 --> 09:03.125
Wasn't like her.
She hated to
borrow.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.625
Was a real blow when she had
to move back in with her mom.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.333
I wouldn't wish that
woman
on anyone.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.041
You worked with her
at the dealership?

09:10.125 --> 09:12.625
Helped her get
the job as a
greeter.

09:12.709 --> 09:15.250
Quit 'cause I
couldn't
stand it anymore.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.625
Bunch of sexist sharks.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.792
No idea why she wanted
to swim in that tank.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.125
Steed Motors. I'll transfer
you
to Service. Hold.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.458
Hi, Mommy.

09:32.542 --> 09:36.000
Aw, geez, Paula,
I totally forgot. Hi, boo!

09:36.083 --> 09:38.291
I gotta run, Donna. I told
you
I got a date tonight.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.083
Yeah, I just gotta close
out.
Just a few things.

09:41.166 --> 09:44.500
Donna, hold all my calls,
will you, doll?

09:44.583 --> 09:45.834
'Clear my next appointment.'

09:45.917 --> 09:47.875
'Tell Mickey
the fleet sales can wait.'

09:47.959 --> 09:49.375
I want to make sure
we get Mr. Callahan here

09:49.458 --> 09:50.834
all squared away tonight.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.375
Certainly, sir.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.542
Now, George, if I can get
him
to throw in the floor mats

09:54.625 --> 09:57.417
with the
rustproofing,
do we have a deal?

09:58.750 --> 10:01.000
'Come on, Frank.
I stole that guy's
trade-in.'

10:01.083 --> 10:02.667
The deal should have been
two-pounder, easy.

10:02.750 --> 10:03.959
Would you lower
your voice, please?

10:04.041 --> 10:06.333
You got a problem,
take it up with Mickey.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.834
Please, sir,
wait.
Sir, please.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.500
Someone has misplaced
Mr. Hathaway's keys

10:11.583 --> 10:13.041
to the Chevy Nova.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.291
I'll get right on that, Sanil.
Perhaps Mr. Hathaway would like

10:15.375 --> 10:18.959
to take one of our vehicles
home tonight, huh?

10:19.041 --> 10:20.542
Tell you what, sir.
Take the car home.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.834
'Bring it back
tomorrow, huh?'

10:21.917 --> 10:22.875
- Donna.
- Yeah.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.125
Stay late tonight?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.583
Yeah, you know,
about that, Mickey.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.500
I've been busting my hump
around here.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.542
We all appreciate
your hump, babe.

10:29.625 --> 10:32.083
Just give me a chance,
alright?
Let me sell a car.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.667
Who's gonna do your
job,
sweetheart, hmm?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.875
You know that Lincoln Mark
trade that came in yesterday?

10:36.959 --> 10:38.875
I know someone right now
I could flip it to.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.250
Alright, we'll see.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.041
What about tonight?

10:44.625 --> 10:47.291
Hey, you want your
shot?
Pay your dues.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.792
Pay your dues.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.792
I gotta stay late.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.458
Can you drop Marisa off
at my mom's, please?

10:54.542 --> 10:56.208
Alright, alright.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.333
Bye, baby.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.583
Single mom, no degree,
what are you gonna do?

11:03.667 --> 11:07.041
We found Donna's body
in the trunk of a '73
Eldorado.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.834
'You know anybody who drove
that kind of car?'

11:08.917 --> 11:13.333
No, but I wouldn't know
a K-car from a Corolla.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.667
'That was Donna's thing.'

11:14.750 --> 11:17.333
She could tell the car
a guy drove

11:17.417 --> 11:18.625
by the shoes he wore.

11:18.709 --> 11:20.083
Lot of late nights
at the dealer?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.417
Maybe too many.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.667
I know it was really
hard
on little Marisa.

11:26.166 --> 11:29.125
But her mom did the
best
that she could.

11:35.750 --> 11:39.750
Boss, Auto Squad found
a VIN number on that
Eldorado.

11:39.834 --> 11:42.041
Tracked the DMV records
on the owner.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.458
Marshall Brooks.
We got him?

11:43.542 --> 11:44.792
He died a
couple
years ago

11:44.875 --> 11:49.166
but he traded in
the Caddy to Steed
Motors

11:49.250 --> 11:50.625
the week before
Donna disappeared.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.291
What's was the name
of that sales manager

11:52.375 --> 11:53.458
who gave a statement
back in '81?

11:53.542 --> 11:54.709
'It was Mickey Thompson'

11:54.792 --> 11:57.250
today the proud owner
of Steed Motors.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.625
Thank you.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.291
You boys let me know
when the Philly PD

12:11.375 --> 12:12.625
is ready to upgrade.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.250
I'll get you into something
with real punch.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.959
'New Charger, 0 to 60
in five seconds.'

12:17.041 --> 12:19.500
'Volume deal,
below invoice.'

12:19.583 --> 12:21.417
Brass gets the new cars.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.166
We drive the beaters
till the wheels fall off.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.250
Personally, I prefer
the American classics

12:26.333 --> 12:31.000
like the '73 Eldorado we
found
Donna D'Amico's body in.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.709
That's a shame.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.333
That gal was a real pistol.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.166
You gave a statement,
said, uh

12:36.250 --> 12:38.250
she left work at 7 o'clock
that night.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.667
Sounds right.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.166
Failed to mention it was
in the trunk of the Caddy

12:41.250 --> 12:42.208
headed for the salvage yard.

12:42.291 --> 12:43.625
Title traced back to this lot

12:43.709 --> 12:45.166
when you were
sales manager, Mickey.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.750
Lot of cars come through, guys.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.250
The beaters go in one
door
and out the next.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.792
Sold off for parts.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.166
But before or after
you stripped the VIN number?

12:51.250 --> 12:53.542
[chuckles]
Hey, hold your horses.

12:53.625 --> 12:56.250
Now, who's the owner
that traded that car in?

12:56.333 --> 12:57.959
Marshall Brooks.

12:58.041 --> 13:01.166
No, I don't remember the car,
but I remember him.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.000
Repeat customer.
One of Bruce's clients.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.625
- Bruce?
- Bruce Donnelly.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.500
Must have taken the Caddy
off trade.

13:08.583 --> 13:11.041
Lot of cash slipped away
on used cars back then.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.417
You're saying this guy
dumped the Caddy?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.208
Well, if it was a clunker

13:14.291 --> 13:16.375
he could have had it stripped
for parts and sent to salvage.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.417
And this Bruce
had a problem with Donna?

13:18.500 --> 13:20.834
Not when she was
getting him
coffee.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.083
Donna was a go-getter.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.792
Hey, you wanna play
with the boys..

13:25.083 --> 13:27.375
...you gotta roll
with the punches.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.750
Yo, Donna.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.625
I just talked to the Tower.

13:34.709 --> 13:36.208
He sees you've been working
your tail off.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.000
I told him you could have
the next up.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.709
Come on.
Mickey went for
that?

13:39.792 --> 13:40.917
Yo, Mickey.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.417
Yeah, give it
to the green
pea.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.291
'Guy's looking
for his daughter.'

13:45.375 --> 13:46.875
'I sold him a car
two years ago.'

13:46.959 --> 13:48.500
'He's a whale.'

13:48.583 --> 13:50.083
I thought Sanil had next up.

13:50.166 --> 13:52.709
Sanil couldn't close a door
with two hands and an arm.

13:52.792 --> 13:53.917
Look, you work this right

13:54.000 --> 13:56.875
this could be worth a pound
or maybe two.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.500
I know everything
about that car, inside
out.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.542
Get him on the hook.

14:00.625 --> 14:01.792
You tell him
to follow you inside.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.917
Don't even turn around,
alright?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.041
Go on.
Go make me proud.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.792
Thanks, Bruce.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.667
Show time.

14:16.834 --> 14:19.417
Come inside?

14:19.500 --> 14:22.166
So the guy wants to know if
we'll take a check, full
amount.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.375
Damn! I knew that guy
was a laydown.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.458
How about that? Didn't even
have
to get him in the box.

14:26.542 --> 14:27.917
That's gotta be some kind
of a record

14:28.000 --> 14:29.542
writing the check
on the hood of a car.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.250
Don't I still have to get
him
inside? Sign paperwork?

14:32.333 --> 14:34.500
Yeah, why don't you get him
to wallpaper the showroom

14:34.583 --> 14:36.083
with his checks
while you're at it?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.667
I thought Bruce
sold him a car.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.291
Every schmuck on the lot
sold that flake a car.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.291
Every month
for the past five
years.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.625
What are you guys
talking about?

14:42.709 --> 14:43.875
The guys a major hoople.

14:43.959 --> 14:46.208
He just likes talking
to car salesmen.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.917
Oh, you think
that's funny, Bruce?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, you can't handle it,
why don't you go back inside

14:54.083 --> 14:55.458
and answer the phone,
sweetheart?

14:55.542 --> 14:57.959
Alright. I think
I'll call your wife
first

14:58.041 --> 14:59.208
tell her about all
the female
customers

14:59.291 --> 15:01.625
'you've been
test-driving, huh?'

15:01.709 --> 15:03.875
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

15:10.875 --> 15:13.500
Salesman should never mess
where he eats.

15:13.583 --> 15:16.125
Especially with the lady
who transfers his calls.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.291
Bruce and Donna had a thing?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.417
'Thing or fling.'

15:18.500 --> 15:19.667
Bruce was a dog.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.250
He always had women
calling the office.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.375
Donna ever get to
tell
on his wife?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.291
All I know
is that he took two weeks

15:25.375 --> 15:27.250
after she disappeared.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.166
Bruce was a closer.
He never took a vacation.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.667
- You never told the cops?
- 'He was still married.'

15:31.750 --> 15:34.125
And at the time,
my top salesman.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.834
Is he still selling cars?

15:35.917 --> 15:37.166
'Last I heard, up the street.'

15:37.250 --> 15:40.333
German luxury sedans,
so screw him.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.417
(Kat)
'Excuse me.'

15:54.667 --> 15:57.542
- Do you have an appointment?
- Don't need one, Bruce.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.500
Excuse me. I thought
you were customers.

16:00.583 --> 16:01.625
(Will)
'We can tell.'

16:01.709 --> 16:03.542
(Kat)
'Here about a car.'

16:03.625 --> 16:05.500
Remember this one?
'73 Eldorado?

16:05.583 --> 16:07.250
Can't say I do.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.625
(Will)
'You took it as a trade-in
from Marshall Brooks'

16:09.709 --> 16:12.375
back when you worked
at Steed Motors.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.250
Long time ago. Maybe I did.

16:14.333 --> 16:17.208
We found Donna D'Amico's body
stuffed in the trunk.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.834
'Greeter girl you had a thing
with before she disappeared?'

16:19.917 --> 16:22.792
I knew Donna. But we
definitely didn't have a
thing.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.875
Your old boss,
Mickey,
says different.

16:25.959 --> 16:28.291
Then he's mistaken.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.709
He's also a jealous schmuck.
Nothing more than a piker.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.291
You can tell him
I said that.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.834
Told us you were the last one
to handle that Cadillac.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.291
That's a crock.
Look, I sold cars.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.542
I didn't process trade-ins.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.291
And I had no problem with Donna.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.875
Way we heard it, she screwed up
your marriage pretty good.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.250
I

16:47.333 --> 16:49.375
All four of 'em.
Didn't need any help with
that.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.000
Truth is, I tried
to help Donna.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.250
'Nobody was moving American
back then.'

16:53.333 --> 16:55.083
'Gas prices..'

16:55.166 --> 16:56.583
...the economy in the toilet.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.709
But she saw something
none of those other jokers

16:58.792 --> 17:01.041
on the line did.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.083
Come on. The guy's
a tire-kicker. Look at
him.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.709
What?
'Cause he's a Puerto Rican?

17:10.792 --> 17:13.458
He won't even come inside.
He hates all the new models.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.417
- Deadbeat.
- Yeah, it's a waste of
time.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.041
Well, get rid of him
before Mickey sees.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.625
He's on the warpath today.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.583
Just let the parts manager
go this morning.

17:20.667 --> 17:21.917
Your kidding. Why?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.291
'Because the parts
keep disappearing, that's
why.'

17:24.375 --> 17:25.959
Blaming him for the break-in
last month?

17:26.041 --> 17:28.709
Hey, just get the chiseler
off the lot, alright?

17:28.792 --> 17:31.125
Mickey called.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.959
Actually, Donna,
you're up. For real.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.125
Mickey said you can't do
any worse than Sanil.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.083
This is no place
for a lady.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.625
You like that car, sir?

17:47.709 --> 17:50.125
I don't know
about these K-cars.

17:50.208 --> 17:53.208
It's a lot of money
for all that plastic.

17:53.291 --> 17:54.500
What's this
leatherette thing?

17:54.583 --> 17:56.709
I can't say
that I blame
you.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.834
Let me show you
something else.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.458
See, I, myself,
I prefer a car

18:02.542 --> 18:04.750
with a little more
meat on its bones

18:04.834 --> 18:07.709
you know what I mean?

18:07.792 --> 18:10.083
- This is a used car.
- And it's priced right.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.583
I mean, forget those
little four-bangers.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.959
What I like is a big V-8.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.625
Some real power
under the hood.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.375
It's a big car.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.667
(Donna)
'You look like the kind
of man that can handle it.'

18:21.750 --> 18:24.500
'I mean, look
at these lines.'

18:24.583 --> 18:27.834
That is real leather inside.
Power everything.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.750
Curves and chrome.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.250
I mean, I think
I lost my virginity

18:32.333 --> 18:36.166
'in the back of one of these
babies, you know?'

18:36.250 --> 18:38.583
- I'm Donna.
- Esteban.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.625
(Donna)
'You wanna talk price?'

18:40.709 --> 18:42.125
Follow me.

18:52.709 --> 18:55.792
She sold that sled
for a pound over Blue Book.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.542
Nobody was moving
the used stuff back then.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.041
And she was smart.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.208
Those American cars
are classics now.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.625
Nothing after 1980 is.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.166
That break-in
you mentioned.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.583
Anybody ever find
out
who did it?

19:06.667 --> 19:07.917
Nope.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.709
- Cops interviewed everybody.
- Inside job?

19:09.792 --> 19:14.625
That car lot, everybody
was working some kind of scam.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.208
(Scotty)
'I dug up the old
burglary report.'

19:19.291 --> 19:22.750
The break-in happened a month
prior to Donna's
disappearance.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.542
They killed the guard dogs?

19:24.625 --> 19:26.583
Yeah. Threw poisoned
meat over the fence.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.750
Stole two grand
worth of parts.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.583
- Insurance cover it?
- Yeah.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.375
The lock on the gate
wasn't even broken.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.667
Trying to track down
the insurance
investigator.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.834
Inside job, Donna could have
got
caught up in the mix somehow.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.083
Well, whoever did
it
had to know

19:39.166 --> 19:40.667
where to flip
stolen auto
parts.

19:40.750 --> 19:44.083
The salesman, Oscar Anderson,
called in the burglary.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.458
And was questioned extensively.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.709
Well, history's
about
to repeat itself.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.750
QD recovered the address
on the Lester receipt

19:49.834 --> 19:50.875
in Donna's jacket.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.125
Receipt?

19:53.917 --> 19:55.458
A business address?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.875
(John)
'482 Ridge Avenue.
Today, it's a Wawa.'

19:57.959 --> 20:01.250
But back in '81,
it was a Goodwill.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.125
Marisa D'Amico came by,
dropped that off.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.625
'Said you asked for it.'

20:04.709 --> 20:07.125
'Personal effects
from her mother.'

20:08.625 --> 20:11.834
I guess she thinks about her
more than she let on.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.291
Now, all you would need to do

20:14.375 --> 20:16.959
to collect your luxury spa
vacation getaway prize

20:17.041 --> 20:19.792
'Mrs. Hanover, is attend
a brief presentation'

20:19.875 --> 20:22.792
'upon your arrival
at our Las Vegas resort.'

20:22.875 --> 20:24.291
'Thank you.'

20:24.375 --> 20:26.000
Bye-bye.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.166
Once a salesman, always
a salesman, huh, Oscar?

20:32.250 --> 20:34.542
Oh, I just do this
to keep me young.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.792
There's nothing quite like
the rush from a good sale.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.041
You remember Donna D'Amico?

20:39.125 --> 20:41.125
I remember the day
the police came

20:41.208 --> 20:42.917
said she'd gone missing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.959
Yup. Left that
little girl
behind.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.125
It's just awful.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.917
You see her
the night before?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.625
No, I had a big
day
on the board.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.000
Took the boys
out
for drinks.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.208
There was a burglary
earlier that month.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.458
- You called it in?
- I was first one on the
lot.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.667
Had to prep a
car
for a customer.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.834
- You think Donna was involved?
- Do you?

21:01.917 --> 21:04.000
Well, I know
people
were desperate.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.834
'You see,
after the oil crisis'

21:05.917 --> 21:08.875
we were selling
an inferior
product.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.458
Hell, the government
had to bail out
Chrysler.

21:11.542 --> 21:13.125
What does that got to do
with Donna?

21:13.208 --> 21:16.250
A lot of guys were
struggling
just to feed their
families

21:16.333 --> 21:19.500
and then Mickey lets this
lady
start selling cars.

21:19.583 --> 21:20.500
Created some resentment.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.792
The day she went on the board

21:21.875 --> 21:23.500
the timing
could not have been
worse.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.250
We gotta squeeze more
out of every deal.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.125
Get 'em in the box.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.333
Work the four square.

21:30.417 --> 21:33.875
Price, down payment,
monthly, trade-in.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.542
And you hammer away.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.041
Start high,
you wear 'em down.

21:38.125 --> 21:39.542
You confuse them!

21:39.625 --> 21:41.000
'When they're ready
to give up'

21:41.083 --> 21:42.125
you call in a closer.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.667
It's not working, Mickey.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.417
They don't like the cars.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
What'd you say?

21:46.583 --> 21:48.375
He means they can't trust us

21:48.458 --> 21:50.542
when they don't trust
the product.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.291
I-I took a guy on a test drive.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.375
I cranked up the window,
and the handle broke.

21:55.458 --> 21:59.709
You want to sell?
They you do whatever it takes!

21:59.792 --> 22:02.667
Cold canvass!
Work the phones!

22:02.750 --> 22:04.041
No shown appointments,
no more ups.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.375
- I'm trying, Mickey.
- No.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.709
No, what you're doing

22:06.792 --> 22:09.500
is that you're
failing,
my friend, okay?

22:09.583 --> 22:12.375
I mean, the coffee girl
could sell cars better than
you!

22:12.458 --> 22:14.166
Yeah, because you let her
take my last up!

22:14.250 --> 22:16.834
- Whoa! I didn't take
anything.
- Shut your mouth, woman.

22:16.917 --> 22:18.208
'Haven't you done
enough already?'

22:18.291 --> 22:20.208
I only closed that deal
'cause you couldn't.

22:20.291 --> 22:23.417
You couldn't close
a window, Hoover.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.583
I've carried
you
long enough.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.166
You know what?
Why don't you..

22:26.250 --> 22:27.750
...why don't you try
selling vacuum
cleaners?

22:32.083 --> 22:35.583
Mickey, Mickey...
please..

22:37.625 --> 22:39.417
I-I-I need this job.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.375
Now you need a new one.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.834
Why are you still here?
Go on, hit the bricks.

22:50.917 --> 22:53.458
I told her not to
worry.
It wasn't her fault.

22:53.542 --> 22:54.750
But Sanil felt otherwise?

22:54.834 --> 22:56.667
I guess I never
thought
he'd hurt her.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.834
(Nick)
'So Donna got promoted,
Sanil got canned.'

22:58.917 --> 23:00.667
(Oscar)
'It's either in the blood
or it's not.'

23:00.750 --> 23:03.542
Some guys just can't close.

23:03.625 --> 23:04.959
Hmm.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.542
(Sanil)
'1979, I came here
with nothing.'

23:10.625 --> 23:13.125
Tried to sell cars
to make a living.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.291
- Chrysler.
- Perfect timing.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.500
Nobody wanted to buy
American anymore..

23:19.458 --> 23:21.625
...especially from me.

23:21.709 --> 23:22.917
Donna D'Amico sold cars.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.458
I understand you had
a big problem with
that.

23:24.542 --> 23:25.792
It wasn't personal.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.166
We were all struggling.

23:27.250 --> 23:30.125
- I realize that now.
- You were humiliated.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.959
They fired you
and you blamed her.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.125
No, I went to night school

23:34.208 --> 23:36.417
to learn computers.
Programming.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.417
1981... Now, that
was perfect timing.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
You ever see Donna again
after they let you go?

23:42.583 --> 23:45.083
Day when I came back
to get my last check.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.834
I hated that place.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.792
You didn't bleed
the customer dry

23:49.875 --> 23:52.333
somebody else
would do it for you.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.333
Esteban, what
are
you doing here?

24:02.417 --> 24:04.041
I can't afford
the car you sold me.

24:04.125 --> 24:06.333
What do you mean? We went over
the numbers, it's a good deal.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.250
But then they called me
to come back in.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.834
Told me there was a problem
with my trade-in.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.166
Problem?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.333
The man said it was worth
less than what you told me.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.375
That I owe more money.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.083
Who called you,
the finance
department?

24:17.166 --> 24:20.709
With this loan, I can afford to
make my payments and make rent.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.333
<i>por favor,</i>
could you do something?

24:23.417 --> 24:27.834
Yeah, just, uh...
just give me a minute,
okay?

24:31.083 --> 24:32.333
What is this, Frank?

24:32.417 --> 24:35.834
Uh, floor mats,
dealer prep fee..

24:35.917 --> 24:37.041
'24% on his loan..'

24:37.125 --> 24:38.667
Hey, I did my job.

24:38.750 --> 24:42.250
Mickey, come on, you got to do
something for this guy.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.792
'The bank's gonna repo his car
that he needs to get to his
job'

24:44.875 --> 24:47.458
'and it's going to
wreck his credit.'

24:53.125 --> 24:55.125
You, uh..
You sign for this?

24:55.208 --> 24:57.041
That your name right there?

24:59.125 --> 25:01.917
You, uh, looking
for a good buy, huh?

25:03.917 --> 25:06.917
Well... good-bye.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.542
You own it, buddy.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.291
Welcome to America.

25:16.041 --> 25:17.834
If they didn't get you
on the front end

25:17.917 --> 25:19.625
F and I got you
on the way out.

25:19.709 --> 25:21.417
Donna told him
she would never

25:21.500 --> 25:22.959
send a customer
in to him blind again.

25:23.041 --> 25:24.750
(Will)
'Big profits on used cars.'

25:24.834 --> 25:26.959
So Donna started cutting
Frank out of the loop?

25:27.041 --> 25:28.750
(Sanil)
'Sure, he figured it out.'

25:28.834 --> 25:31.500
I could think of a lot
of names for Frank.

25:31.583 --> 25:34.500
But stupid...
isn't one of them.

25:36.625 --> 25:39.917
Donna's compact, baby bracelet
from the hospital

25:40.000 --> 25:42.417
phone bills.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.667
It looks like the grandmother
swept it into a box

25:44.750 --> 25:46.834
after Donna disappeared.

25:46.917 --> 25:48.500
Kind of sad.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.041
All she has
left
of her mom.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.458
Christmas card
from the dealership.

25:54.542 --> 25:57.959
Doesn't say who sent it,
but the address is
handwritten.

25:58.041 --> 26:00.208
Nothing else
with the name
Lester.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.375
Are Donna's keys in there?

26:12.792 --> 26:15.083
There's uh..

26:15.166 --> 26:17.625
...grandmother's apartment..

26:17.709 --> 26:19.709
...car..

26:19.792 --> 26:21.458
...and then there's this one.

26:21.542 --> 26:24.250
(Nick)
'Kind of looks like it fits
one
of those old steamer trunks.'

26:35.291 --> 26:36.417
Huh!

26:38.041 --> 26:40.375
Finally found your Lester.

26:47.417 --> 26:48.834
Thanks for bringing
that stuff in.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.667
I'm sorry.
It's all I had.

26:53.583 --> 26:57.500
Your grandmother by any chance
own a piano, Marisa?

26:57.583 --> 26:59.458
A piano? No.

26:59.542 --> 27:00.792
Why?

27:00.875 --> 27:04.333
This is a key to a piano.

27:04.417 --> 27:07.041
The one your mother
put a down payment
on..

27:07.125 --> 27:09.208
...the day before
she was murdered.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.709
I don't get it.

27:17.291 --> 27:20.000
A Lester piano.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.333
The reason your mom
cleaned out her bank account.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.125
She bought a piano?

27:31.291 --> 27:33.750
(Marisa)
'She said we didn't have
any room for it.'

27:33.834 --> 27:35.792
She was looking
for a new place.

27:35.875 --> 27:38.375
I remember her
telling me that.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.750
I just wanted it
to be true.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.500
Let's do it again.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.000
We can't, boo.
I have to be at work.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.500
I want a
piano,
a real one..

27:55.583 --> 27:56.583
...to play at home.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.417
Well, maybe someday..

27:58.500 --> 28:00.041
...when we find
a place for it.

28:00.125 --> 28:02.542
Grandma doesn't
have enough space.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.625
And that is another reason why
mommy has to go to work now.

28:05.709 --> 28:07.583
I don't like it
when you got to
work.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.250
I don't either,
you know, but..

28:09.333 --> 28:11.125
everybody's got a job
they gotta do.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.750
Do you like
your job, Mommy?

28:12.834 --> 28:16.000
I like that I found
something that I'm good at.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.417
You know, it's
real important in life

28:18.500 --> 28:21.041
that you find something
that you're good at.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.500
She always had
to go away.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.875
I used to think
she went to work..

28:31.959 --> 28:33.917
...to get away from me.

28:37.125 --> 28:40.834
I know what it's like to
have
a parent walk out on you

28:40.917 --> 28:42.750
as a kid, Marisa.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.166
But that's not
what
your mother did.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.500
Now, I'm gonna find out
whoever took her away from you.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.792
I was in mortgages until
the sub prime thing blew up.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.375
Never thought I'd find
another business

28:59.458 --> 29:01.667
that would tank as bad
as American cars, but I did.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.792
Cars, caskets, still dinging
them on the way out, huh,
Frank?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.041
Your line of work

29:07.125 --> 29:09.542
should the bereaved
ever need a referral.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.583
You were the numbers guy
at Steed Motors

29:11.667 --> 29:13.000
back in the '80s?

29:13.083 --> 29:14.875
The numbers stunk.
That's why I got out.

29:14.959 --> 29:18.333
See, and we thought it was
'cause of that burglary in
'81.

29:18.417 --> 29:19.667
You saying I robbed the place?

29:19.750 --> 29:20.917
Well, probably made
the boss money

29:21.000 --> 29:23.125
on that insurance claim.
Win-win.

29:23.208 --> 29:24.458
Donna figure it out, too?

29:24.542 --> 29:26.250
All those calls of yours
she transferred?

29:26.333 --> 29:27.834
That what this is about,
Donna D'Amico?

29:27.917 --> 29:29.166
She cut you out.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.792
Kept you from screwing
the customers on the back end.

29:30.875 --> 29:32.208
She didn't get it.

29:32.291 --> 29:33.709
Customers have all the power.

29:33.792 --> 29:35.083
They can leave any time.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.917
Our job was no different
than yours.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.208
Come again?

29:38.291 --> 29:40.583
Get 'em in the box,
get as much as you can

29:40.667 --> 29:42.500
get 'em to sign before
they walk out the door.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.709
Do I look like a salesman
to you, Frank?

29:44.792 --> 29:46.750
You do what you have to do.

29:46.834 --> 29:50.875
Befriend, persuade,
control, lie.

29:50.959 --> 29:52.667
But once they sign..

29:52.750 --> 29:54.375
...they're gonna
pay for it for years.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.041
Oh, Donna got it, Frank.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.375
She just did it her way.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.291
It just turned out to be
bad for your business.

29:59.375 --> 30:02.000
Donna figured out how the real
money was made on the lot.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.875
And that put her
in direct conflict

30:03.959 --> 30:06.625
with someone a lot more
dangerous than me.

30:09.917 --> 30:11.500
Who the hell do
you think you are?

30:11.583 --> 30:13.792
Telling customers not to
buy
add-ons or financing.

30:13.875 --> 30:15.208
Why, so you can
rape my customers

30:15.291 --> 30:16.542
on the back end, Frank?

30:16.625 --> 30:18.125
You don't know
when to quit.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.709
Hey, she's right, Frank.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.125
All you young sharks
are destroying our business.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.917
You rip a customer's head off
on a deal, they never come
back.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.208
Stay out of this, Oscar.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.542
Kills all our referrals,
all our repeat business.

30:28.625 --> 30:30.083
You don't sell a man one car.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.375
You sell him a dozen cars
over a lifetime.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.792
That's a profession,
damn it.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.917
Go blow a sale,
you old bag of wind.

30:39.792 --> 30:40.917
Why would I help you, Frank?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.917
You're selling cars
out from under me.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.083
What are you talking about?

30:44.166 --> 30:46.125
I had a guy on the hook
the other day

30:46.208 --> 30:48.750
selling a '72 Chevelle
only to find out

30:48.834 --> 30:50.417
it had already
been sold.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.125
That wasn't my call. That car
was promised to the wholesaler.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.500
For a song. I know
the Blue Book on that car.

30:55.583 --> 30:56.959
I could have sold it
for twice that.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.250
Talk to the Tower.

30:58.333 --> 30:59.875
Who, Mickey?

30:59.959 --> 31:03.333
Why would we dump a good car
for that much less?

31:03.417 --> 31:05.000
If you know what's
good for you,
lady..

31:05.083 --> 31:08.250
...you talk to your boss
before
selling another used car.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.250
Donna figured out
the sales manager

31:13.333 --> 31:14.583
was giving the best trade-ins

31:14.667 --> 31:16.125
to the wholesaler for peanuts.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.959
Mickey?
Why would he do that?

31:18.041 --> 31:19.875
Kickbacks. He was
lining his pockets.

31:19.959 --> 31:21.458
Screwing over
the dealership owner

31:21.542 --> 31:22.625
and Donna knew it.

31:22.709 --> 31:24.125
But you signed her timecard.

31:24.208 --> 31:26.792
Said Donna left
at 7:00 that night.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.834
Mickey had me do that
for everybody.

31:28.917 --> 31:30.417
I closed a deal that night.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.000
She was there at least
till 10:00.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.583
He had you take care of
that
old Cadillac too, Frank?

31:34.667 --> 31:36.000
Me? No.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.917
Mickey decided what happened
to every trade-in.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.959
Whether it went to the lot,
wholesaler..

31:41.041 --> 31:42.875
...or the salvage yard.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.667
[chuckles]
Got me in the box,
Detective?

31:53.750 --> 31:55.041
Yep.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.417
Well, I've done this
to thousands of customers.

31:58.500 --> 32:02.166
Unlike those schmucks,
I know I can walk anytime.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.166
Yeah, you made quite
a living ripping people
off.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.583
People always think
they're getting ripped off.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.375
Look, you're trying
to get the best deal

32:07.458 --> 32:08.417
I'm trying to make a living.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.875
I just don't like to lose.

32:09.959 --> 32:12.375
Talking about you
ripping off your boss
off..

32:12.458 --> 32:13.625
...the dealership owner.

32:13.709 --> 32:15.291
Stole so much
you became one
yourself.

32:15.375 --> 32:16.750
Bunch of twaddle.

32:16.834 --> 32:18.458
The smart owner knows
every guy on the lot

32:18.542 --> 32:19.959
is working some kind of scam.

32:20.041 --> 32:22.375
Too bad Donna figured out
your big used car scam.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.583
'She didn't leave
at 7 o'clock like you said.'

32:24.667 --> 32:26.291
'She stuck around
to confront you.'

32:26.375 --> 32:27.834
You got nothing.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.709
One of your old lackeys clued
us in as to how you worked

32:30.792 --> 32:33.792
the break-in, the inside
job,
insurance fraud.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.709
Sounds like I need
better lackeys.

32:35.792 --> 32:37.542
Willing to
testify
that you sent

32:37.625 --> 32:39.667
that '73 Caddy
to the salvage
yard.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.125
'With Donna's body
in the trunk.'

32:44.458 --> 32:46.875
(Nick)
'The only thing we care about
here is the homicide, Mick.'

32:46.959 --> 32:48.375
Who told you this nonsense?

32:48.458 --> 32:49.500
Frank?

32:49.583 --> 32:50.542
Let's see..

32:51.834 --> 32:55.000
The price for
homicide
is life.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.375
Plus fees, which..

32:57.458 --> 32:59.500
...you'll be paying
on the inside.

32:59.583 --> 33:04.125
'Now your down payment
so far, is zero.'

33:04.208 --> 33:06.041
What do you want your
monthly payment to be?

33:06.125 --> 33:08.000
Unless of course,
you're offering a
trade-in?

33:08.083 --> 33:10.750
Do you have anything
to trade, Mick?

33:10.834 --> 33:12.667
'Except a bunch of bull?'

33:12.750 --> 33:14.250
See..

33:14.333 --> 33:15.709
I'm willing to
go
to bat for you

33:15.792 --> 33:17.166
but you gotta
give something
up.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.041
You gotta...you gotta
meet me in the middle.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.500
My boss..

33:20.583 --> 33:23.625
[chuckles]
...he's gonna
hammer me on this one.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.834
So this is your best offer.

33:30.291 --> 33:32.792
'I don't think it's gonna
get this deal done.'

33:36.250 --> 33:38.125
I liked Donna.

33:38.208 --> 33:41.750
Gotta hand it to her.
She was a hell of a salesman.

33:41.834 --> 33:43.834
In some ways, too good.

33:43.917 --> 33:46.583
- 'At selling cars?'
- Used cars.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.667
She had an eye for it.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.583
She knew what a car
was really worth.

33:50.667 --> 33:53.417
Like the ones you sent back to
the wholesalers for kickbacks?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.458
Couldn't let her kill
the golden goose.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.375
So I offered her a deal.

34:13.041 --> 34:14.625
I know what
you're
doing, Mickey.

34:14.709 --> 34:17.125
You know just enough
to get yourself in trouble.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.667
Close the door.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.834
Me? You're the one
stealing this place blind.

34:25.917 --> 34:27.125
You're screwing over
the owner.

34:27.208 --> 34:28.250
The owner thinks
I'm a hero

34:28.333 --> 34:30.000
'cause I make him
a lot of money.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.166
You?

34:32.250 --> 34:34.709
Well, he doesn't even know
your name, sweetheart.

34:34.792 --> 34:37.792
All I wanted was
a chance to sell, you
know.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.667
A chance to prove myself.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.625
Yeah, yeah, and you got that.
Thanks to me.

34:42.709 --> 34:45.250
Huh? Congratulations.

34:48.166 --> 34:50.125
You got your bonus.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.500
Fair and square.

34:51.583 --> 34:54.750
Tops on the board,
profit-wise.

34:54.834 --> 34:57.000
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.750
You know, Oscar was right.

34:58.834 --> 35:00.542
We keep doing business
like this

35:00.625 --> 35:01.959
and there ain't gonna
be
any business left.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.667
Oscar? Why you listening
to Oscar for?

35:03.750 --> 35:05.291
He hasn't
sold a car in months.

35:05.375 --> 35:06.917
What do you mean? I thought
you took him off the board

35:07.000 --> 35:08.166
to handle fleet sales.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.250
Oscar couldn't handle
a yard sale.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.667
'Would've fired him
a long time ago'

35:11.750 --> 35:13.667
but I felt bad
for the old guy.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.709
Let him wash cars
to earn his keep around here.

35:15.792 --> 35:17.333
I earned this.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.458
For me and for 'Riss.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.500
- Sure, kid.
- Yeah.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.709
Hey, hey..
But in the future?

35:22.792 --> 35:25.583
You check with me before
you sell a trade-in.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.667
Never came back.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.041
Thought she took
the money and ran.

35:32.125 --> 35:34.041
Tell me about this Oscar,
the has-been.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.625
Tough racket, selling cars.
Game just passed him by.

35:36.709 --> 35:38.750
Was he there the night
that Donna disappeared?

35:38.834 --> 35:39.959
Every night.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.959
He had a lot of cars to wash.

35:42.041 --> 35:44.125
Even let the old guy lock up.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.792
They pulled DMV records
on an Oscar Anderson.

35:49.875 --> 35:53.542
Found his name registered
to a 1971 Cadillac Eldorado.

35:53.625 --> 35:56.875
'71? Donna's body was
found
in the trunk of a '73.

35:56.959 --> 35:58.375
Right, a salvage yard beater.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.542
But the models share a lot
of the same parts

36:00.625 --> 36:02.417
and those require upkeep.
You know, seats, wheels

36:02.500 --> 36:03.917
'bumpers, you name it.'

36:04.000 --> 36:05.333
It's possible Oscar was
taking parts off the
beater

36:05.417 --> 36:06.625
for a '71 Caddy.

36:06.709 --> 36:08.208
Yeah, didn't know
he was gonna need it

36:08.291 --> 36:10.208
that night to hide a body.

36:15.834 --> 36:18.583
Power locks, power
steering, power roof.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.333
It's a car ahead
of its time.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.000
Won it back in '71.

36:22.083 --> 36:23.417
'Top man on the board.'

36:23.500 --> 36:24.875
'Nine out of 12 months.'

36:24.959 --> 36:26.709
- A real classic.
- Oh, yeah.

36:26.792 --> 36:29.709
Bet you Donna could appreciate
a car like this.

36:29.792 --> 36:32.375
She turned out to be
a pretty shrewd sales
gal.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.875
'Got to admit that.'

36:33.959 --> 36:36.792
Kind of a shame how it
ended for you there, Oscar.

36:36.875 --> 36:38.375
'At the dealership.'

36:38.458 --> 36:40.542
Oh, I had my cold spells.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.041
'But I'll tell you this.'

36:42.125 --> 36:44.709
When I was on a roll,
there was nobody hotter.

36:44.792 --> 36:48.583
Mickey told us you hadn't
sold a car in months.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.041
You lied to us, Oscar.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.291
(Rush)
'Said you were out
celebrating some sale.'

36:52.375 --> 36:55.000
Boozing with the boys
the night Donna disappeared.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.959
Well, that's ridiculous.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.792
I don't remember if
it was that exact night.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.375
You should, 'cause you
were there on the lot.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.000
Out back washing cars.

37:04.083 --> 37:06.125
You were the next Hoover.

37:06.208 --> 37:08.291
One step away from hawking
vacuum cleaners.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.083
- Magazines, telemarketing--
- Now, wait just a damn
minute.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.333
I had a run of bad luck
is all.

37:13.417 --> 37:15.417
But my customers
always came back to me.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.792
You were done, Oscar.

37:16.875 --> 37:18.208
Doing chores for Mickey.

37:18.291 --> 37:20.375
Locking up, taking
the beaters to salvage.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.125
Yeah, like that '73 Caddy.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.500
And when you stripped
the VIN number off

37:23.583 --> 37:25.083
'probably some parts, too.'

37:25.166 --> 37:28.583
'71 never had
an egg-crate style grill.

37:28.667 --> 37:29.959
It's 'cause it's from a '73.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.291
Oh, come on.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.542
We take this car apart
we're gonna find

37:32.625 --> 37:34.000
more parts from that '73?

37:34.083 --> 37:36.041
- You can't do that.
- You got careless, Oscar.

37:36.125 --> 37:37.792
You dumped the body,
but you took the parts.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.166
Stole her money, and left her
to rot in that junkyard.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.500
But, hey, you sent Donna's
family a Christmas card.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.250
Marisa saved it. It's
got
your handwriting on
it.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.125
Did you really think that would
make up for killing her mother?

37:46.208 --> 37:50.792
I didn't kill that woman.
And I did not steal her
bonus.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.417
What bonus, Oscar?

37:55.083 --> 37:57.125
How'd you know she got
a bonus, Oscar?

37:57.208 --> 37:58.291
You just told me.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.917
'No, we said
you took her money.'

38:00.000 --> 38:01.542
Now how'd you know about
the bonus she got that night?

38:01.625 --> 38:03.333
Now hold on a minute.
Just wait a second.

38:03.417 --> 38:07.125
I'm trying to explain.
I... I want to..

38:13.375 --> 38:15.917
It wasn't me that changed.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.959
You know, it...
it was the business.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.542
You give me a quality car

38:23.625 --> 38:26.792
bet your ass, I could
still close 'em.

38:26.875 --> 38:28.291
Sure you could.

38:29.792 --> 38:31.625
We can work something
out here, right?

38:31.709 --> 38:34.041
We...we can work
something out?

38:34.125 --> 38:36.792
Yeah, we can work
something out.

38:44.333 --> 38:47.375
Just a spell of bad luck,
that's all it was.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.959
If I could have just
broken through..

38:53.625 --> 38:56.542
I'd have been right back
on top of that board.

39:02.375 --> 39:03.834
Hey, Oscar.

39:03.917 --> 39:06.875
Oh, hey, Donna.

39:08.333 --> 39:11.250
Just prepping a car
for an appointment
tomorrow.

39:13.917 --> 39:16.125
It's good to see you
still get repeat business.

39:16.208 --> 39:17.667
Well, it's the only way.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.000
You build a reputation

39:19.083 --> 39:21.500
it's about
repeats
and referrals.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.917
Matter of time, I'm back
on
a roll bucking for that
bonus.

39:26.583 --> 39:29.041
Hey, who won it this
time,
by the way?

39:29.125 --> 39:32.208
I sold another car
today, Oscar.

39:32.291 --> 39:34.041
- I got the bonus.
- What?

39:34.125 --> 39:36.375
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.291
I..

39:38.375 --> 39:41.375
That's great,
kid!
Congratulations
!

39:41.458 --> 39:44.041
Yeah.

39:44.125 --> 39:45.917
So how'd you close
that baby?

39:47.291 --> 39:49.458
You know, I just knew
what the guy wanted.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.792
And I let the sale
come to me.

39:51.875 --> 39:53.875
Like you say.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.458
Get a real charge
out of it, too.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.125
Oh, don't I know it.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.875
That feeling
never gets
old.

39:59.959 --> 40:02.208
You see this car here,
came on the lot today?

40:02.291 --> 40:04.375
- 'Yeah, the Impala.'
- Yeah.

40:06.583 --> 40:09.875
Back in '72, I must have
sold 20 of these babies

40:09.959 --> 40:12.083
the minute
they
hit the lot.

40:12.166 --> 40:13.834
Still a good car.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.125
People just don't, uh..

40:16.208 --> 40:18.709
...hold on to them anymore.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.500
Harold Bloom.
Look at that.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.500
Yeah, that's his trade-in.

40:22.583 --> 40:25.250
That's the guy
I sold the car to today.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.166
I know Harold.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.166
I sold him this car.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.250
- You sold him this car?
- This Impala?

40:31.333 --> 40:32.709
Harold's my client!

40:32.792 --> 40:34.375
You know what I had to do
to make this sale?

40:34.458 --> 40:36.834
- Look, he just came in.
- He didn't ask for you.

40:36.917 --> 40:38.834
- Why the hell not?
- I don't know.

40:38.917 --> 40:41.750
Look, I feel terrible.
I am so sorry.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.166
I'll split the commission
with you.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.750
I don't want your charity!

40:44.834 --> 40:47.208
You know,
it's just, it's not
right.

40:47.291 --> 40:49.375
It's not
how you do
business.

40:52.166 --> 40:54.208
I feel horrible.

40:56.166 --> 40:59.125
- You don't have to do this.
- Do what?

40:59.208 --> 41:00.792
You don't have to
wash cars for Mickey

41:00.875 --> 41:02.500
'you know, you could do
something else.'

41:02.583 --> 41:04.375
How dare you?

41:04.458 --> 41:06.291
You know, I'm not some vacuum
cleaner salesman.

41:06.375 --> 41:08.083
Who do you think
you're talking
to?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.542
I was selling cars
when you were in
diapers.

41:10.625 --> 41:14.750
I have been a closer
since before you were
born!
