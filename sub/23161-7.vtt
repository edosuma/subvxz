WEBVTT

00:01.819 --> 00:03.548
He belongs behind bars.

00:03.621 --> 00:06.146
Not for murder.
Yes, for murder!

00:06.223 --> 00:07.451
He hurt Mommy.

00:07.525 --> 00:08.958
Did you see him do that?

00:09.026 --> 00:10.550
I'm not supposed to tell.

00:10.628 --> 00:11.788
Call off the hearing,
Aldridge.

00:11.862 --> 00:14.660
Mr. Magnum, I really
hope you have some other way
of earning a living,

00:14.732 --> 00:17.132
because your days
as a private investigator
are over.

00:17.201 --> 00:19.465
Well, you can't
take these matters
into your own hands.

00:19.537 --> 00:20.697
It might be justice.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.968
This is the only
physical evidence that
you bring into this courtroom

00:24.041 --> 00:26.066
to tie this man to a crime
he did not commit.

00:26.143 --> 00:28.475
I'm trying to answer
the question you asked me.

00:28.546 --> 00:30.104
Objection! Objection!

02:00.388 --> 02:02.219
Where are you going?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.547
You're not going out
without me.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.759
Greg, I'm talking to you.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.169
A birthday poem for Nana
from Beth.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.832
Honey, wait for me.
I'll change my clothes.

02:21.909 --> 02:22.876
Don't bother.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.672
It won't take
but a minute.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.804
I said, don't bother.

02:26.881 --> 02:30.044
Well, I am bothered.
And I wanna talk about it.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.317
There's nothing
to talk about.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.854
I'll see you later.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.914
Greg,
where are you going?

02:44.799 --> 02:47.734
If you think I'm gonna
sit home and wait for you,
you're crazy!

02:47.802 --> 02:49.599
I don't care
what you do.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.537
You're not...
Come back here!
You're not leaving!

02:52.606 --> 02:53.630
Watch me!

02:53.707 --> 02:55.299
Don't!

02:55.376 --> 02:57.173
Give me the keys.
I'm getting out of here.

02:57.244 --> 03:00.372
No!
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.938
That's right.
Keep pushing.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.174
Don't!

03:05.486 --> 03:06.817
I'll call the police.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.354
You leave
and I'll call the police!

03:08.422 --> 03:11.391
You humiliate me
one more time
and I'll kill you!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.854
Big man.
Big, scary man!

03:36.150 --> 03:37.811
Oh, my God.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.618
Ow.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.505
Good morning, Higgins.
How nice of you to knock.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.478
I was just making
some breakfast.
Protein drink.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.812
Goat's milk,
brewer's yeast, raw eggs
and desiccated liver.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.407
Would you like some?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.619
You want something, Higgins?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.954
I've just been examining
the grounds.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.955
Have you any idea
what you've done?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.497
The gate!

04:24.565 --> 04:26.692
Oh, I'm sorry about the lock.
See...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.632
I'm not referring to the lock.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.863
A breach of security
could perhaps be overlooked,

04:30.938 --> 04:33.964
but how can one
possibly overlook death
and mutilation?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.736
Mutilation?

04:36.177 --> 04:38.304
Do you deny that you drove
the car off the driveway,

04:38.379 --> 04:41.371
thereby destroying dozens
of healthy, thriving flowers

04:41.549 --> 04:44.040
which Kenji and I
had scheduled to plant
this morning?

04:44.118 --> 04:45.449
Flowers?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.581
What flowers?

04:49.290 --> 04:50.587
The flowers.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.420
Gee, I don't remember...
I...

04:53.494 --> 04:56.793
The hours Kenji and I spent
discussing, searching,

04:56.864 --> 05:00.095
seeking out the ideal plants
for that section
of the estate.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.533
The joy we felt
when the plants arrived.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.268
The hope we shared

05:04.338 --> 05:07.466
as this year's
Yard and Garden Show
judging drew near.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.942
All of that destroyed
with one reckless turn
of the steering wheel.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.273
It was dark.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.643
I mean, Higgins,

05:13.714 --> 05:16.615
don't you think
you're overreacting
just a little bit?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.208
They're just flowers.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.051
I might have expected
something like that from you.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.489
This morning,
I came to a startling
and horrifying realization.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.493
Since your arrival
at Robin's Nest,

05:27.561 --> 05:30.553
you have insidiously
eroded away
my sense of diligence.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.957
Security has fallen
completely apart.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.001
The grounds are in
a terrible state of neglect.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.264
This guesthouse
should be condemned.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.669
It doesn't look so bad!

05:38.739 --> 05:40.138
And the estate
is completely overrun

05:40.207 --> 05:41.697
with your
good-for-nothing friends,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.766
sleazy clients
and unexpected guests.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.573
That is not true!

05:45.746 --> 05:46.838
Hi, Thomas.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.548
The gate was open,
so I just came on in.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.478
I am now going
to call a locksmith

05:55.556 --> 05:57.490
before someone else
arrives unannounced,

05:57.558 --> 06:01.392
and then I am going
to put away the Ferrari
for good.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.588
Carol.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.789
Jonathan.
- Higgins?

06:03.864 --> 06:07.095
We are going back
to a strict regimen
around here.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.863
A military regimen.
Good day.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.029
Higgins!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.205
Thomas...
Carol.

06:13.274 --> 06:16.175
Come in, sit down,
have some protein drink.
I'll be right back.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.267
Where are you going?

06:17.344 --> 06:18.971
I'm...
Now, I made
a special trip over here

06:19.046 --> 06:21.606
because you said
you could talk to me
about my case.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.344
That's what you get
when you go to your friends
for free advice.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.510
I knew this would happen...

06:25.586 --> 06:27.451
I have to clear up
this car thing with Higgins.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.285
...so I had the department
give me an advance
on your salary. Cash!

06:35.129 --> 06:36.494
You're hiring me?

06:38.265 --> 06:40.199
<i>What makes you think</i>
<i>she's telling the truth?</i>

06:40.267 --> 06:41.495
Why would she lie to me?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.899
That's what lawyers
get paid to do.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.530
Look, Thomas, if it were such
an open-and-shut case,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.870
I mean, why would she hire you
to go snooping around?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.432
It's an important trial.
There's gonna be
a lot of press coverage.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.604
She just wants to make sure
the police didn't miss
anything

06:52.680 --> 06:54.307
in their investigation.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.470
Hey!

06:56.050 --> 06:57.244
What do you think
of this one?

06:57.318 --> 06:59.582
Look, did she tell you
that the girl
that turned up dead

06:59.653 --> 07:00.881
had something
of a reputation?

07:00.954 --> 07:03.980
$1,000 down,
limited 30-day warranty?

07:04.058 --> 07:06.526
$1,000 would eat up
the rest of my savings.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.584
Thomas, those girls
hung around the club a lot.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.289
They were the drinking
and partying set...

07:10.364 --> 07:11.524
Will you forget
about the case?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.930
I thought you were gonna
get me a deal on a car.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.663
Hey, Rick!
Okay, okay.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.804
Hey, bro!
Hey, how you doing?

07:18.872 --> 07:21.272
Hey, bro! How you doing?
All right, all right.

07:21.342 --> 07:24.869
Thomas Magnum, I want you
to meet Willie Kanati...
Kali... He's Hawaiian.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.845
Willie K., we'll say.
How are you?

07:26.914 --> 07:27.938
How's it?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.482
Willie here has got
the most incredible talent

07:29.550 --> 07:31.984
for putting the right car
with the right person.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.180
Thomas here is looking
for a good used car
cheap, Willie.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.181
Hey, today is
your lucky day!

07:41.895 --> 07:44.557
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>and you're wrong.</i>

07:44.631 --> 07:46.223
<i>I could have bought</i>
<i>something sensible,</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:48.063
<i>something with</i>
<i>low maintenance.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:51.263
<i>But I realized</i>
<i>that, as a professional</i>
<i>private investigator,</i>

07:51.338 --> 07:53.670
<i>I needed something with speed,</i>

07:53.741 --> 07:56.335
<i>something that would</i>
<i>help me out in an emergency.</i>

07:56.410 --> 07:58.344
<i>Something I could depend on.</i>

07:58.412 --> 08:01.381
<i>Not to mention the value</i>
<i>it had as an investment.</i>

08:08.188 --> 08:11.351
<i>You have to look</i>
<i>at these things</i>
<i>in terms of the long run.</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:24.194
You know,
if it weren't for Elizabeth,

09:24.264 --> 09:26.858
I'd probably
pull into a cocoon

09:27.401 --> 09:29.392
and hide away

09:31.038 --> 09:33.506
from this whole ugly mess.

09:34.341 --> 09:38.141
But, for Beth's sake,
I intend to see
that justice is done.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.210
Your granddaughter...

09:40.280 --> 09:41.508
It's funny

09:42.716 --> 09:47.551
how families come together
for weddings and funerals,
isn't it?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.215
The happiest day of my life

09:50.290 --> 09:53.123
was when Debbie married Greg.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.628
Her first husband died
in an automobile accident,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.690
and she always seemed

10:02.569 --> 10:04.503
a little lost after that.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.739
And Beth needed
a full-time daddy
around the house.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.701
She loved Greg so much.
We all did.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.106
To think, somehow,

10:17.451 --> 10:20.318
it has all deteriorated
to this...

10:28.829 --> 10:31.320
Those were taken
several months ago.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.495
Debbie decided she wanted
to file for divorce,

10:35.335 --> 10:37.030
and she wanted proof

10:37.905 --> 10:40.999
that Greg was beating her.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.600
Your granddaughter
witnessed the murder?

10:45.712 --> 10:48.909
You know, it wasn't
until after the funeral

10:50.484 --> 10:52.850
That I remembered
I even had these photographs.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.820
I hope they will do some good.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.624
Do you have any idea
what he might have done
with the murder weapon?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.627
I didn't even know
he had a gun.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.960
He must've been

11:06.800 --> 11:08.563
at very close range.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.266
I'm sorry. I...
We can talk about this later.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.807
No, no, it's all right.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.167
Our neighbors heard
the gunshot

11:18.245 --> 11:22.045
and they saw Greg
drive out of here very fast.

11:23.584 --> 11:25.381
After they found Debbie,

11:27.154 --> 11:30.590
the police picked him up
at his...

11:31.558 --> 11:33.526
At a lady friend's house.

11:33.594 --> 11:35.494
But they never found
the gun.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.661
Mrs. Carrington, I know

11:44.471 --> 11:46.905
that you don't want
your granddaughter to testify.

11:46.974 --> 11:50.137
No. No.
She's been through enough.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.968
But I wondered
if she could talk to me.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.781
She might remember something
that would lead us
to the weapon.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.383
There is nothing
she could tell you

12:00.921 --> 12:04.084
that I haven't already
told the police.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.130
This is where he went
off the road in his hurry
to get out of here.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.898
But the police said
these tracks
don't prove anything.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.967
I'm so glad you think
they might be useful.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.670
Has anyone moved
that car since...

12:23.744 --> 12:26.611
No, no,
the police impounded it.
They still have it.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.645
There's something else
that has been bothering me.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.682
For the last few months,
I began to hear gossip

12:35.756 --> 12:37.087
that Greg had been
married before,

12:37.157 --> 12:40.183
something he never mentioned
to Debbie or me.

12:40.494 --> 12:43.122
I tried to talk to her
about it, but somehow...

12:43.764 --> 12:47.200
Oh, I don't know.
She was always so insecure.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.931
Perhaps she didn't want
to know.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.998
Anyway, I don't know
whether this is any help
to your investigation,

12:54.074 --> 12:56.770
but I wanted to make sure
I told you everything.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.909
Well, thank you.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.525
I'm sure
it's nothing serious.
T.C. Can take a look at it.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.366
Carol!

13:24.071 --> 13:26.130
You just went through
a red light!

13:26.206 --> 13:27.639
Are you trying
to get me killed?

13:27.708 --> 13:29.437
You've come up
with worse suggestions.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.000
Okay, I am sorry
my car died.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.478
It's not like I did it
on purpose.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.481
The reason I hired you
to investigate

13:35.549 --> 13:38.450
was because
I didn't wanna go around
spending my valuable time

13:38.518 --> 13:40.315
driving around
gathering up evidence.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.718
Look out!

13:41.788 --> 13:43.346
Nice Ford.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.716
Let me out of here!

13:46.793 --> 13:48.488
You wanted to go
to the Hall of Records,

13:48.562 --> 13:50.996
I'm taking you
to the Hall of Records.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.497
After that,
you're on your own.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.658
Fine!

13:56.903 --> 13:59.303
These photographs
are incredible!

13:59.372 --> 14:02.603
This is just the kind
of evidence we need
to lock down the case.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.576
I thought it was
already locked down.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.441
Well, it is, practically.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.573
I mean, a lot of people
have offered to testify
that he had a violent temper.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.914
But now, we have
physical evidence
that he hit her.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.510
All you have
are some photographs.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.021
And if Mrs. Carrington's
hunch is right,

14:16.089 --> 14:18.717
if we do find an ex-wife
somewhere in the woodwork,

14:18.792 --> 14:20.919
we may have one hell
of a surprise witness.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.655
I still wish
we had a murder weapon.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.527
Can you make me
copies of these
to send to the defense?

14:25.599 --> 14:28.159
And I'll need a couple copies
of the tire tracks, too,

14:28.235 --> 14:30.032
because I want
to introduce them
into evidence

14:30.103 --> 14:31.627
to corroborate
the neighbor's testimony.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.605
Anything else?
Yeah.

14:34.941 --> 14:37.136
I'm sorry I yelled at you
in the car.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.242
Oh, forget it.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.075
No, no. There was no excuse.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.945
No, no.
No, I'm sorry.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.381
And you know what?
When I get back
to the office,

14:45.452 --> 14:46.817
I'm gonna call
the disbursement clerk

14:46.887 --> 14:49.185
and I'm gonna tell him
he was so wrong,

14:49.256 --> 14:50.814
'cause you really are
worth the money.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.153
Very funny.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.420
Thomas Magnum?
Yes, that's us.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.019
I've got that information
you wanted on Greg Bowman.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.121
Great!

14:58.198 --> 15:01.599
Now, I found only one
marriage license application,

15:01.668 --> 15:04.432
but there's something else
here I think you'll wanna
take a look at.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.062
Excuse me.

15:06.540 --> 15:07.700
Ms Jones.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.607
Ray, I'm busy. I told you
never to call me
at the office.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.211
What are you
talking about?

15:20.854 --> 15:23.652
You can't do this to me, Ray,
not on the phone.

15:24.825 --> 15:26.292
Is it someone else?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.528
Would you stop it, please?
I don't believe this!

15:28.595 --> 15:31.189
This is the same conversation
she had two years ago.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.424
Do you mind?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.660
You knew
I was a career woman...
It was the same conversation

15:34.734 --> 15:37.225
she had two years ago
when I was here
on another case.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.329
Could we just
get the paperwork
and get out of here?

15:39.406 --> 15:42.864
I don't see why
we can't at least
have dinner. I...

15:43.143 --> 15:45.168
Why can't we discuss this,

15:45.245 --> 15:48.305
you know, like
two civilized human beings?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.539
Ray.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.680
Don't you dare
hang up on me, Ray, I...

15:59.860 --> 16:01.191
Gee, I'm sorry.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.729
Why don't you just mind
your own business?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.924
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to listen, I...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.467
Thomas, look.

16:09.703 --> 16:14.538
"Application to marry,
Gregory Xavier Bowman,
Deborah Ann Carrington.

16:14.608 --> 16:19.045
"Certificate of live birth,
Gregory Xavier Bowman,
September 17, 1947.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.704
"Certificate of death,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.710
"September 19, 1947."

16:24.784 --> 16:27.309
Greg Bowman died
when he was two days old.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.355
Who've they got in jail?

16:33.793 --> 16:37.160
This time,
it is not going to work.
I know you.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.630
First, you hook me in
with some cockamamie story

16:39.699 --> 16:41.690
and then,
after I'm in over my head,
you yell, "Surprise!"

16:41.768 --> 16:43.895
Thomas, I am just
as surprised as you are.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.335
No, no, no, no.
Scout's honor.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.997
This is how you operate.

16:47.073 --> 16:50.065
First I find out
the suspect isn't the guy
you said he was,

16:50.143 --> 16:52.475
and now I find out
you don't even have a case
against the guy.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.944
I do!
You do not!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.412
Do you have a confession?
No.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.915
Do you have witnesses
to the crime?
Now, you listen here.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.508
You're just cranky...

16:59.585 --> 17:01.314
I am not cranky!

17:01.387 --> 17:04.117
Oh, all right, all right.
You are just out of sorts

17:04.190 --> 17:05.781
because your new car
broke down.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.848
But please don't take it out
on the case.

17:07.926 --> 17:10.020
You have been paid
to investigate.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.226
Well, Thomas, I think
your little red wagon

17:13.299 --> 17:14.732
is running again.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.361
I mean, that guy...
That guy must've
spent hours

17:17.436 --> 17:18.869
looking through
death certificate records

17:18.938 --> 17:20.838
to come up
with a new identity.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.035
So, all we had to do
was synchronize
the carburetor...

17:24.109 --> 17:26.101
What I'm wondering is,
why would he go
to that trouble

17:26.179 --> 17:27.669
unless he had
something to hide?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.511
He could have
for any number of reasons.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.111
...replace the condenser...

17:32.185 --> 17:35.018
Like trying to hide
criminal activity, huh?
...intake manifold gaskets...

17:35.088 --> 17:36.715
Nobody knows
where he came from,

17:36.789 --> 17:38.848
he has no visible
means of support...
...the fan belt...

17:38.925 --> 17:40.392
and yet he's able
to afford

17:40.460 --> 17:43.361
the services
of M. Barry Aldridge,

17:43.429 --> 17:45.863
one of the most
formidable criminal attorneys
in the state.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.593
Now, where does he get
that kind of money?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.862
Yeah, then I tightened
the fan belt

17:49.936 --> 17:51.301
and I changed the oil.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.032
You know, if you warm
this thing up properly,

17:53.106 --> 17:54.266
you shouldn't have
any more trouble.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.864
Oh, great, T.C. Thanks.

17:55.942 --> 17:59.503
And that should come
to $49.88.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.641
You're charging me?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.814
This is not
a mechanic's shop.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.747
I am doing you a favor.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.323
So you should be willing
to pay for your own parts.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.360
Thomas, the man
fled the scene of the crime.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.294
His skin was found
under his murdered wife's
fingernails.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.194
The bullet taken
from her body

18:19.265 --> 18:21.130
matches the gun
registered in his name.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.428
Everyone that knew him

18:22.502 --> 18:27.201
said that he had a brutal,
violent, possessive temper.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.865
He terrorized his wife.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.636
I think I can prove
he killed her.

18:30.710 --> 18:35.340
But I'm gonna need
every single piece of evidence
I can get to put him away.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.739
Well, I can
call his friends,

18:37.817 --> 18:40.411
see if they know
his aliases.
Great!

18:40.486 --> 18:44.513
And check with Five-O
for fingerprints
and see what they turn up.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.716
Oh, it's already
taken care of.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.555
I'm supposed to
stop by there
this afternoon

18:47.627 --> 18:49.561
to see what
they've come up with,
if anything.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.324
T.C., you have
my change?
What are you doing?

18:51.397 --> 18:53.661
Don't worry about it.
I'll take it off your fee.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.530
Doesn't it feel good
to be able to pay your debts?

18:55.601 --> 18:57.592
Yeah, well,
it feels good to me.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.598
Oh.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.667
10, 11, 12 cents.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.044
Island Hoppers.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.609
Maybe we'll get lucky.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.243
Maybe he'll just call us up
and tell us his name.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.379
You'll find it,
super-sleuth.
I know you will.

19:17.857 --> 19:22.021
Hey, Tom. Some guy's
been calling the club
trying to find you.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.892
Some lawyer named
M. Barry Aldridge?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.962
I understand
you work for the city.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.563
No,
I'm a private investigator.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.867
Oh, is that right?

19:34.941 --> 19:37.307
Make a pretty good living
at it, do you?

19:38.377 --> 19:39.537
I get by.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.074
Actually, I've heard a lot
of good things about you.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.140
You're a top-notch
investigator,

19:45.218 --> 19:48.676
the kind of guy
who'd do very well
working in a firm like ours.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.823
Well, I'm happy
working for myself.
I like the hours.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.017
We handle dozens of cases
every year, big cases.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.792
The kind
that keep my daughters
in private school.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.424
As a matter of fact,
we could use someone

20:01.501 --> 20:04.402
who knows when a case
is worth investigating
and when it isn't.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.841
Mr. Aldridge,

20:16.616 --> 20:18.106
what are you saying?

20:18.918 --> 20:23.252
Well, sometimes it works
better for everyone
not to spin your wheels,

20:23.523 --> 20:25.150
if you follow my drift.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.557
Wait a minute.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.692
You would pay me
not to investigate?

20:33.099 --> 20:34.828
If it was to our benefit.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.196
It's kind of like
a government subsidy
not to grow wheat.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.707
Something like that, I guess.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.944
So, in other words,

20:46.445 --> 20:49.243
let's say you had a case,
insurance fraud.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.207
Well, yes, that falls
within our area of expertise.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.150
Well, how much
would that be worth to me?

20:55.221 --> 20:58.782
I mean, would I be paid
on a commission basis
or hourly?

20:58.858 --> 21:01.588
I could spend a lot of time
not investigating.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.421
That would be
up to my discretion,
Mr. Magnum.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.132
Well,
would a murder be worth more
than a burglary, for instance?

21:08.200 --> 21:11.761
I mean, I'd hate to waste
my time not investigating
the penny ante stuff.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.135
I see we have nothing further
to discuss.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.504
No, no. This is
a fascinating concept.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.010
I just need some time
to think about it.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.341
You know, maybe I could
bring some cases to you.

21:21.414 --> 21:25.043
There's this one case that
I haven't been investigating
for nearly five years.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.210
Would this payment
be retroactive?

21:29.155 --> 21:32.022
He should be reported.
I'm going straight
to the Ethics Committee.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.549
He didn't say anything.
We were alone and he didn't
say anything incriminating.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.220
He should be taken
off the case!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.991
Will you calm down?
You're getting all rattled.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.225
That's exactly what he wants.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.597
Now, come on, calm down.
All right, all right.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.499
You're right. I'm calm.
Good.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.004
I just wish
I would've been there,
that's all.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.801
I think
we've got a match.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.477
Oh, Thomas, look.
He's our guy!

21:54.347 --> 21:55.746
His name is Randy Lewis.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.749
He was arrested
as he reported to work.

21:57.817 --> 22:02.777
Mr. Lucky's Casino,
Atlantic City.
Booking number 82015112.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.181
Suspicion of murder.
His wife.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.186
He was acquitted!

22:08.494 --> 22:11.657
Looks like he has
a whole string of assault
and battery arrests.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.221
And no convictions.

22:13.299 --> 22:14.561
Right.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.463
Thomas Magnum.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.103
Hi, Lieutenant.
Yeah, I heard
you were in here.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.901
Say, what's with you?

22:22.108 --> 22:24.133
You've been stepping
on some toes again.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.145
We just heard that
some very important people

22:27.213 --> 22:29.511
are after your license.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.909
Finding him
at the girlfriend's house
could be damaging.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.348
Perhaps we could send her
on a vacation?

22:35.421 --> 22:38.356
Someplace where
the prosecution can't find her
to make a deposition.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.823
Call off the hearing,
Aldridge.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.156
Mr. Aldridge,
I tried to tell him
you were busy.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.458
Mr. Magnum,
we are preparing a case.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.725
Now, we really don't have
any more time for banter,

22:46.799 --> 22:48.061
as amusing as you are.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.864
You got no grounds
for trying to pull my license.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.298
Well, let's see.
What about misrepresentation,

22:54.373 --> 22:57.740
conflict of interest,
unethical conduct,
just to name a few?

22:58.511 --> 22:59.910
You should have thought
of the consequences

22:59.979 --> 23:01.276
before you barged
into my office

23:01.347 --> 23:03.713
and tried to bully information
out of me about my client.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.479
I never talked
about your client.
You called me.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.750
I have no record
of our calling him.

23:16.629 --> 23:20.759
You're going to testify
under oath at a court hearing
that you didn't call me?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.858
Perhaps I won't have to
testify at all.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.630
It seems to me there are
a number of witnesses

23:24.704 --> 23:27.104
that can attest
to your abusive behavior.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.809
It doesn't matter whether
I investigate this case
or someone else does.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.076
You can't stop the process,
Aldridge.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.243
Your client
is going on trial,

23:40.319 --> 23:43.811
and it'll be up to a jury
to decide whether he's guilty
or innocent, not you.

23:43.889 --> 23:47.290
My client's guilt
or innocence is not really
any of my concern.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.595
My only concern is to see
that he's not convicted.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.956
And by the way,
the frosting on the cake

23:53.032 --> 23:55.500
is that I get to see
your license revoked.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.693
Now, I really hope you have
some other way of earning
a living, Mr. Magnum,

23:58.771 --> 24:01.672
because your days
as a private investigator
are over.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.073
Exactly what
is the meaning of this?

24:45.751 --> 24:47.776
Well, it's a little hard
to tell in the dark,

24:47.853 --> 24:50.048
but those look like
the keys to my car,

24:50.122 --> 24:53.353
a car I bought with earnings
from this very important case

24:53.425 --> 24:55.017
that I've been working on,

24:55.093 --> 24:58.529
because you, in a moment
of petty and impulsive
vindictiveness,

24:58.597 --> 25:01.293
a moment so unworthy
of you, Higgins,

25:01.366 --> 25:03.596
you took away my rights
to the Ferrari.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.159
Well, you're going
to have to do
something about it.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.704
It was belching
exhaust fumes

25:06.772 --> 25:07.864
all over
the Duchess of Wellington.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.771
Was? You didn't turn it off?
Of course I did.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.638
If you turned it off,
it won't start again!

25:11.710 --> 25:13.439
It was fouling
the rose garden.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.605
We're going back
to a strict regimen,
Magnum.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.410
You may as well
accept it.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.212
My God.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.413
What happened
to that poor woman?

25:25.857 --> 25:28.883
Her husband.
He's being charged
with her murder.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.094
Do these photographs
look funny to you, Higgins?

25:35.167 --> 25:39.297
I don't know whether
it's the light or the pose.
I don't know.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.237
Take a look at this.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.517
The lower
right-hand corner.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.918
This is a photograph
of a photograph.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.847
They've been doctored.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.887
That's a very distinct
possibility.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.296
I don't believe it.
How did she do it?

26:06.365 --> 26:09.960
Well, looks like
she took an existing
photograph,

26:10.035 --> 26:12.094
darkened it in areas
to look like bruises,

26:12.170 --> 26:16.300
and then took a photograph
of that so we couldn't tell
it was tampered with.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.967
But even the negatives
are perfect.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.505
Almost.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.947
Take a look at it. Here.

26:24.616 --> 26:28.313
You can just see the corner
of the original photograph
right there,

26:28.687 --> 26:29.915
in here.
Ah!

26:31.690 --> 26:33.885
Oh, that poor woman.
Yeah.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.450
That poor woman
gave you false evidence.

26:36.528 --> 26:39.554
Well, she's probably
too scared
to leave anything to chance.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.555
I know how she feels.

26:44.002 --> 26:47.768
Oh, Thomas, it's like
I have opening-night jitters.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.837
I keep having
this recurring dream.

26:51.677 --> 26:52.974
I dream that...

26:54.179 --> 26:55.840
You promise you won't laugh?

26:56.381 --> 26:57.848
Not even a snicker.

26:59.885 --> 27:01.250
In my dream,

27:01.787 --> 27:05.018
I get to court,
I open my briefcase,

27:05.490 --> 27:08.220
and I have nothing in it
except blank paper.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.353
You promised
you wouldn't laugh!

27:14.666 --> 27:17.533
I just keep thinking
that there's something
I haven't locked down,

27:17.602 --> 27:20.366
some loophole that Aldridge
will pull his client through

27:20.439 --> 27:22.168
and it'll be all my fault.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.236
I couldn't
concentrate yesterday,

27:24.309 --> 27:26.140
so I went for a walk
down to Queen Emma Street,

27:26.211 --> 27:28.076
and I'm just standing there,

27:28.146 --> 27:32.139
and I stood and I stared
at that courthouse
for the longest time.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.714
Well, anyway,
it made me feel better.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.250
Carol,

27:39.958 --> 27:42.392
maybe we should talk
to the little girl.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.419
No.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.699
She might remember something
that would lead us
to the weapon.

27:48.767 --> 27:50.997
And then what do we do?
We put her on the stand?

27:51.069 --> 27:53.867
Aldridge is gonna pull
every trick in the book
to get Bowman off.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.270
And you wanna play
by his rules?

27:55.340 --> 27:58.036
I don't want this guy
walking away.
Well, neither do I.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.475
Look, as a lawyer,
I can tell you

27:59.544 --> 28:00.943
that she's not
a reliable witness.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.572
She's too young,
she's too traumatized.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.515
There's no telling
what Aldridge would get her
to say.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.213
And the truth of it
is that most lawyers
would put her on the stand.

28:09.287 --> 28:13.451
I can't, Thomas.
I just can't ask her
to relive that night.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.894
We have enough
without her testimony.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.429
And I am now going
to go home

28:18.497 --> 28:20.829
and I'm gonna memorize it
all one more time.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.298
Thanks for supper.

28:23.668 --> 28:26.831
And don't worry
about it, Thomas.
We'll get him.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.968
Yeah, I know.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.870
<i>Part of me knew that Carol</i>
<i>was absolutely right.</i>

29:05.310 --> 29:09.076
<i>But part of me couldn't</i>
<i>put aside the price we'd pay</i>
<i>if she was wrong.</i>

29:11.249 --> 29:14.650
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>how I was going to get in</i>
<i>to see the little girl</i>

29:15.187 --> 29:17.781
<i>or what I was going to say</i>
<i>if I did see her.</i>

29:18.790 --> 29:21.816
<i>But I knew</i>
<i>I had to at least play it out.</i>

29:28.166 --> 29:29.292
Hi.

29:35.507 --> 29:38.874
Nana isn't here.
She's inside.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.643
Well, maybe I could talk
to you.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.340
Are you going
to take my picture?

29:47.719 --> 29:49.118
Do you want me to?

29:56.928 --> 29:58.691
I saw you before.

30:00.398 --> 30:04.528
Nana says you're going
to make Greg go to jail
for a long time.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.676
Do you know why?

30:17.983 --> 30:19.473
He hurt Mommy.

30:24.789 --> 30:27.849
Did you see him do that?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.353
I'm not supposed to tell.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.969
Well, I think
it would be all right
to tell me.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.743
No, it's all right.
You don't have to do that.

30:47.812 --> 30:49.109
It's all right.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.820
They were yelling
and yelling,

30:59.624 --> 31:01.251
and he hit her,

31:03.395 --> 31:05.488
and all the books fell down,

31:08.300 --> 31:09.665
and then he left.

31:11.469 --> 31:13.232
And I tried to hug her,

31:13.972 --> 31:15.564
but she pushed me away.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.009
She told me to go to bed

31:22.414 --> 31:23.904
and she...

31:25.717 --> 31:27.378
Then she...

31:28.787 --> 31:30.846
She picked up the gun.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.548
After he left?

31:35.860 --> 31:37.953
And it made a loud noise.

31:39.965 --> 31:43.765
And my mommy died.
My mommy died!

31:49.507 --> 31:50.804
It's okay.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.740
What have you done?

32:14.348 --> 32:15.679
She's sleeping.

32:20.555 --> 32:22.682
My daughter
was an only child,

32:23.324 --> 32:24.757
and she was spoiled.

32:24.826 --> 32:27.056
She was used to having
her own way.

32:27.128 --> 32:30.586
And Lord knows,
she had a lot of problems.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.430
But she didn't deserve
to die.

32:34.802 --> 32:37.066
Railroading Bowman
isn't gonna change that.

32:37.138 --> 32:38.628
The fact that
he didn't kill her

32:38.706 --> 32:40.571
is simply an accident
of timing.

32:40.641 --> 32:44.099
I wish to God I had pictures

32:44.612 --> 32:47.137
of every time he beat her up.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.278
But you don't.

32:50.351 --> 32:51.818
He tricked us, all of us,

32:51.886 --> 32:53.979
took us in
and then betrayed us.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.386
He robbed us of everything

32:55.456 --> 32:56.889
that was good
about this family.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.585
He belongs behind bars.

32:58.659 --> 33:01.389
Not for murder.
Yes, for murder!

33:02.430 --> 33:04.421
He killed his first wife.

33:04.499 --> 33:06.228
He was acquitted!
He was guilty!

33:06.300 --> 33:07.790
You don't know that!

33:10.171 --> 33:12.639
This is a recording

33:13.141 --> 33:15.871
my granddaughter was making
for my birthday.

33:15.977 --> 33:18.946
I found it
still in the tape recorder
the next morning.

33:19.013 --> 33:20.844
<i>Don't!</i>

33:22.016 --> 33:24.314
<i>I'll call the police.</i>
<i>You leave</i>
<i>and I'll call the police!</i>

33:24.385 --> 33:26.945
<i>You humiliate me</i>
<i>one more time</i>
<i>and I'll kill you.</i>

33:28.189 --> 33:30.817
<i>Big man.</i>
<i>Big, scary man!</i>

33:31.792 --> 33:34.784
<i>I swear I'll kill you.</i>
<i>I got away with it before.</i>

33:34.862 --> 33:36.159
<i>Don't push me.</i>

33:36.230 --> 33:37.356
<i>I'll do it again!</i>

33:38.866 --> 33:40.493
<i>Oh, don't hurt me.</i>

33:46.807 --> 33:49.674
<i>Big man.</i>
<i>Big, scary man!</i>

33:50.378 --> 33:53.711
<i>I swear I'll kill you.</i>
<i>I got away with it before.</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:55.180
<i>Don't push me.</i>

33:55.249 --> 33:56.443
<i>I'll do it again!</i>

34:00.288 --> 34:02.153
He leaves right after that.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.458
Then my daughter's suicide
is also recorded,

34:07.728 --> 34:11.596
establishing, of course,
that at least this time,
he was not responsible.

34:12.233 --> 34:16.192
When I found Debbie,
I wiped her fingerprints
off the gun,

34:16.270 --> 34:19.797
threw it
into the trash compactor,
and I called the police.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.833
I didn't think,
until much later,

34:24.312 --> 34:26.438
about fixing the photographs.

34:30.918 --> 34:33.284
You take it with you,
Mr. Magnum.

34:33.353 --> 34:36.790
Listen to it
as many times as I have

34:36.857 --> 34:41.521
and then tell me
if what I did was wrong.

34:44.899 --> 34:47.891
How'd the hearing go?
They gonna get your license?

34:47.969 --> 34:50.802
Aldridge withdrew the charges.
Hit-and-run tactic.

34:50.905 --> 34:52.532
How you doing?

34:53.306 --> 34:56.003
Well, the jury selection
went faster than I expected.

34:56.077 --> 34:59.137
He's rushing me,
hoping to push me off balance.

35:00.147 --> 35:02.081
Well, you're too wily
for that.

35:03.918 --> 35:05.146
I was gonna call you later.

35:05.219 --> 35:07.210
I've got you
on the docket tomorrow.

35:07.288 --> 35:09.188
I'm gonna be introducing
the tire track pictures,

35:09.257 --> 35:11.782
so you'll have to explain
how you went about
taking them,

35:11.859 --> 35:16.125
how you know that they match
the tires on the Rolls,
all that stuff. Okay?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.687
Is tomorrow all right?

35:17.765 --> 35:20.563
Carol, the tracks
don't prove anything.

35:20.635 --> 35:22.364
You don't need me to testify.

35:22.436 --> 35:26.099
When you've built a case
on overwhelming
circumstantial evidence,

35:26.173 --> 35:28.073
you need to present
every piece

35:28.142 --> 35:30.940
of that overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

35:31.012 --> 35:33.139
I know the tire tracks
aren't important
by themselves,

35:33.214 --> 35:35.842
but they do corroborate
the neighbor's testimony.

35:37.418 --> 35:39.283
I... I just don't know.

35:39.353 --> 35:42.220
Oh, come on, Thomas.
Don't hang me up.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.315
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:51.632 --> 35:55.363
<i>Private investigators</i>
<i>often work right</i>
<i>on the fringes of the law.</i>

35:55.436 --> 35:57.961
<i>As a private citizen,</i>
<i>I had no legal obligation</i>

35:58.039 --> 36:00.098
<i>to tell anyone</i>
<i>that Bowman was innocent.</i>

36:00.174 --> 36:03.632
<i>But what about the moral</i>
<i>and ethical obligations?</i>

36:04.378 --> 36:07.108
<i>I wanted time</i>
<i>to make the right decision,</i>

36:07.181 --> 36:11.311
<i>but it was clear</i>
<i>I wasn't in control</i>
<i>of how much time I'd have,</i>

36:11.719 --> 36:14.244
<i>or of anything else,</i>
<i>for that matter.</i>

36:17.391 --> 36:19.757
These are superb specimens,
Kenji.

36:19.827 --> 36:23.126
They'll look
absolutely magnificent
once they're planted.

36:23.197 --> 36:26.689
It will be comforting
living once again
in an ordered universe.

37:01.035 --> 37:02.525
<i>Hi, Thomas.</i>

37:02.603 --> 37:05.265
<i>I'm sorry if I was</i>
<i>kind of short with you today.</i>

37:05.339 --> 37:07.967
<i>I guess I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about the case.</i>

37:08.109 --> 37:10.669
<i>Will you call me back?</i>
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

37:21.322 --> 37:23.187
All right, Magnum,
what is it that you want?

37:23.257 --> 37:24.485
Well, I was hoping
I had butter,

37:24.558 --> 37:26.253
but I guess I'll just
have to eat it plain.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.091
Don't be flippant.
I'm referring to
that collection of scrap metal

37:29.163 --> 37:32.564
and baling wire
that you so whimsically
call your car.

37:32.633 --> 37:34.123
What do you want
to get rid of it?

37:34.201 --> 37:37.398
I would love to get
rid of it, Higgins,
but I can't.

37:37.471 --> 37:39.530
The guy who sold it to me
won't take it back,

37:39.607 --> 37:41.472
and if I sell it as is,
I'll lose money,

37:41.542 --> 37:44.670
so I guess I'll just
have to take it to T.C.
For another look.

37:44.745 --> 37:45.973
Popcorn?
No.

37:46.547 --> 37:48.947
It's perfectly obvious
what you're doing.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.415
You're resisting
my plan

37:50.484 --> 37:51.849
to go back
to a military regimen.

37:51.919 --> 37:55.047
This is all
an elaborate trick
to get the Ferrari back.

37:55.122 --> 37:57.682
But it won't...
Aren't you going
to answer your phone?

37:57.758 --> 37:59.851
No.
As I was saying,
it won't work.

37:59.927 --> 38:01.690
It's not a trick.
And don't answer my phone.

38:01.762 --> 38:03.093
You can't just
let it ring endlessly.

38:03.164 --> 38:04.825
Don't answer my phone!

38:05.766 --> 38:08.894
<i>Hey, Thomas, if you're worried</i>
<i>about testifying,</i>

38:08.969 --> 38:11.335
<i>we can talk about</i>
<i>what you're going to say.</i>

38:11.405 --> 38:15.364
<i>But at least call me</i>
<i>and let me know you're going</i>
<i>to be there tomorrow.</i>

38:15.576 --> 38:17.601
<i>Okay? Please?</i>

38:18.379 --> 38:20.677
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>
<i>Call me.</i>

38:23.551 --> 38:25.485
You're worried
about testifying tomorrow?

38:26.353 --> 38:28.150
I don't think I'm going to.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.456
Trial by jury is one
of the cornerstones

38:32.526 --> 38:34.187
of democracy.
I know that, Higgins.

38:34.261 --> 38:36.991
And yet you would
avoid your civic duty?

38:40.034 --> 38:41.729
Well, what would you do?

38:42.803 --> 38:47.263
I just found out this guy
killed his first wife
and was acquitted.

38:47.341 --> 38:49.832
He can never be tried
for that crime again.

38:55.049 --> 38:56.448
Well, even so,

38:57.451 --> 38:59.681
I realize there are flaws
in the system, but...

38:59.753 --> 39:03.154
But, Higgins, he's about to go
on trial for a second murder.

39:03.724 --> 39:06.887
Then this time, surely,
justice will prevail.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.356
Will it?

39:11.098 --> 39:14.465
I have the proof
that he didn't commit
this crime.

39:15.236 --> 39:16.931
Proof he doesn't
even know about.

39:17.004 --> 39:18.130
So what's my civic duty?

39:18.205 --> 39:21.402
Do I go forward
and inform the court
that he's innocent

39:21.475 --> 39:23.500
and let him walk away again?

39:25.412 --> 39:27.380
Or do I just keep quiet

39:27.448 --> 39:30.349
and let him go to jail
for a crime he didn't commit?

39:33.754 --> 39:36.587
Well, you can't
take these matters
into your own hands.

39:36.657 --> 39:38.386
That's vigilantism.

39:38.592 --> 39:40.025
That's anathema to everything

39:40.094 --> 39:42.995
that is civilized
and virtuous in human society.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.229
It might also be justice.

39:48.102 --> 39:49.831
Poetic justice, at least.

39:54.608 --> 39:56.075
<i>I'll call the police!</i>

39:56.143 --> 39:59.112
<i>You humiliate me</i>
<i>one more time</i>
<i>and I'll kill you!</i>

39:59.747 --> 40:03.046
<i>Big man.</i>
<i>Big, scary man!</i>

40:03.117 --> 40:05.984
<i>I swear I'll kill you.</i>
<i>I got away with it before.</i>

40:06.053 --> 40:07.645
<i>Don't push me.</i>

40:07.721 --> 40:09.052
<i>I'll do it again!</i>

40:18.999 --> 40:19.966
Hello?

40:20.034 --> 40:21.695
<i>Thomas,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

40:23.070 --> 40:24.799
<i>Carol, if I take the stand,</i>

40:24.872 --> 40:26.669
<i>what do I have to testify to?</i>

40:26.740 --> 40:29.937
<i>Just the photographs.</i>
<i>That's all the physical</i>
<i>evidence you have,</i>

40:30.010 --> 40:32.706
<i>unless you've come up</i>
<i>with a signed confession.</i>

40:33.147 --> 40:34.637
<i>That was a joke.</i>

40:34.982 --> 40:37.177
<i>You will be there,</i>
<i>won't you, Thomas?</i>

41:05.579 --> 41:07.069
That's my car!

41:12.186 --> 41:14.017
And it is
your expert opinion

41:14.088 --> 41:17.319
that these tracks
were made by the tires

41:17.391 --> 41:20.360
which are on the Rolls-Royce
driven by the defendant?

41:20.794 --> 41:22.455
Yes.
Thank you.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.368
Mr. Magnum,
how long have you been
a private investigator?

41:32.439 --> 41:33.633
Object.

41:34.074 --> 41:37.168
Overruled.
The witness will answer
the question.

41:37.478 --> 41:39.070
About six years.

41:39.346 --> 41:40.574
About six years.

41:40.648 --> 41:43.981
And before that, you were
in naval intelligence,
is that correct?

41:44.051 --> 41:47.543
Your Honor, I...
Establishing the credibility
of the witness, Your Honor.

41:47.621 --> 41:50.522
Something the prosecution
has already managed to do.

41:55.529 --> 41:56.518
May I?

41:58.799 --> 42:02.701
These tire tracks,
Mr. Magnum,

42:02.770 --> 42:04.567
they're very impressive.

42:06.073 --> 42:08.507
Is this the kind of work
you did for your country?

42:08.575 --> 42:10.008
Your Honor, I object.

42:10.077 --> 42:11.669
Withdraw the question.

42:13.547 --> 42:16.209
Mr. Magnum, you testified
that these tracks

42:16.283 --> 42:20.083
match the tread on the tires
of the Rolls-Royce
driven by the defendant

42:20.220 --> 42:23.280
on the evening
of July 18th of this year,
is that correct?

42:23.357 --> 42:24.415
Yes.

42:25.192 --> 42:26.454
I see.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.457
Can you pinpoint for me
the exact hour
that those tracks were made?

42:31.365 --> 42:32.389
No.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.797
I see.

42:34.868 --> 42:38.099
Or, perhaps, who was driving
the car the night the tracks
were left in the mud?

42:38.172 --> 42:40.868
Can your photographs
tell us that?
No.

42:40.941 --> 42:42.340
Your Honor, I object.

42:42.409 --> 42:45.572
Yet this is the only
physical evidence that
you bring into this courtroom

42:45.646 --> 42:48.274
to tie this man to a crime
he did not commit.

42:48.348 --> 42:49.542
No.

42:51.919 --> 42:53.011
What?

42:53.087 --> 42:56.454
No, it is not the only
physical evidence I have

42:56.523 --> 42:58.423
of the events of that evening.

43:11.939 --> 43:14.066
No further questions,
Your Honor.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.870
I'm trying to answer
the question you asked me.

43:17.377 --> 43:20.107
Your Honor, we request
a brief recess.

43:21.014 --> 43:24.415
The witness
will be allowed to answer
the question, Counselor.

43:25.853 --> 43:30.813
I have a tape recording
of the defendant
and the victim...

43:30.924 --> 43:32.824
<i>No!</i>
<i>You're not going anywhere!</i>

43:32.893 --> 43:34.019
...the night
that she was killed.

43:34.094 --> 43:36.688
Your Honor,
there is no foundation laid
for this evidence

43:36.764 --> 43:38.459
before anything
can be played here.

43:40.267 --> 43:42.735
<i>I'll call the police.</i>
<i>You leave</i>
<i>and I'll call the police!</i>

43:42.803 --> 43:45.431
<i>You humiliate me</i>
<i>one more time</i>
<i>and I'll kill you!</i>

43:46.640 --> 43:49.040
<i>Big man.</i>
<i>Big, scary man!</i>

43:49.109 --> 43:52.135
Objection! Objection!
Objection!
<i>I swear I'll kill you.</i>

43:52.312 --> 43:54.473
<i>I got away with it before.</i>
<i>Don't push me.</i>

43:54.548 --> 43:56.413
<i>I'll do it again!</i>

43:57.184 --> 43:58.515
Your Honor...

43:58.585 --> 44:00.553
Objection sustained.

44:00.854 --> 44:02.845
Testimony will be struck
from the record,

44:02.923 --> 44:05.756
and the jury is admonished
to disregard it.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.026
I will meet with counsel
in my chambers.

44:12.933 --> 44:14.833
You will join us, Mr. Magnum.

44:30.184 --> 44:33.642
Your conduct
in court today
was absolutely inexcusable.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.857
This is hardly the first time
you've testified
in a court of law.

44:37.925 --> 44:41.326
You know better than
to bring unsubstantiated tapes
to the witness stand.

44:41.395 --> 44:44.228
Your Honor, you didn't hear
what was on the rest
of the tape.

44:44.298 --> 44:45.560
I believe if you listen to...

44:45.632 --> 44:48.192
Hearsay evidence, Your Honor.
There's no way of knowing
whether that tape

44:48.268 --> 44:50.259
has been altered
or manufactured.
It hasn't.

44:50.337 --> 44:53.534
It's an unproven,
unknown voice and therefore
it's inadmissible.

44:53.607 --> 44:56.735
The little girl can verify
the conversation, Your Honor.

44:56.810 --> 44:57.902
Your Honor!

44:57.978 --> 44:59.445
I'll hear the tape.

45:02.182 --> 45:03.774
This is set on record.

45:08.488 --> 45:12.254
<i>Your conduct in court</i>
<i>was absolutely inexcusable.</i>

45:12.693 --> 45:15.594
<i>This is hardly the first time</i>
<i>you've testified</i>
<i>in a court of law.</i>

45:15.662 --> 45:19.029
<i>You know better than</i>
<i>to bring unsubstantiated tapes</i>
<i>to the witness stand.</i>

45:19.099 --> 45:21.693
<i>Your Honor,</i>
<i>you didn't hear what was</i>
<i>on the rest of the tape.</i>

45:21.768 --> 45:24.202
<i>I believe if you listen to...</i>
- <i>Hearsay...</i>

45:28.942 --> 45:30.466
Your Honor, I don't know
how that happened.

45:30.544 --> 45:32.409
I thought
I was turning it off.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.413
I mean, the buttons
are so close together.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.312
I'll tell you what was on
the rest of the tape.

45:36.383 --> 45:37.611
There's no foundation.

45:37.684 --> 45:40.346
I'd think there'd be
an exception made
in this instance,

45:40.420 --> 45:42.945
given the fact that evidence
has been destroyed.

45:43.523 --> 45:47.425
Even if we had the tape,
it'd be hard to establish
a foundation for its accuracy.

45:47.494 --> 45:48.518
But, Your Honor, if you...

45:48.595 --> 45:50.961
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to rule
for the defense.

45:52.132 --> 45:54.396
But I wanna make
one thing perfectly clear.

45:54.468 --> 45:57.198
There will be
no more theatrics
in my courtroom.

45:59.573 --> 46:00.801
Now, we'll recess

46:00.874 --> 46:03.775
while I consider
the ramification
of the altered tape,

46:03.844 --> 46:06.039
and then we'll resume
in an hour.

46:14.888 --> 46:17.186
Looks like you outsmarted me
after all.

46:22.663 --> 46:24.688
Thomas...
Let's go for a walk.

46:37.778 --> 46:40.303
Did you ever find yourself
in a position

46:40.380 --> 46:43.543
where you decide
to do the right thing,

46:44.184 --> 46:47.847
no matter how hard it is,
and then you go and do it

46:48.789 --> 46:52.816
and something else happens,
something entirely different

46:52.893 --> 46:55.020
than what you thought
would happen,

46:55.228 --> 46:58.288
and it turns out that that,
in an odd sort of way,

46:58.365 --> 47:02.028
is probably more right
than what you had in mind
in the first place?

47:02.903 --> 47:05.531
You wanna run that by me
one more time?

47:06.006 --> 47:08.167
No, I think
I better leave it alone.

47:08.642 --> 47:11.304
What do you think
the chances are
of a conviction?

47:11.378 --> 47:14.245
If the judge doesn't declare
a mistrial, real good.

47:14.348 --> 47:16.839
The jury was very impressed
with that tape.

47:18.452 --> 47:19.851
Thomas,

47:21.955 --> 47:25.482
it's better if I don't ask
what was on the rest
of that tape?

47:33.266 --> 47:35.200
Let's take a walk
down Queen Emma Street.

47:35.268 --> 47:37.634
There's a great view
of the courthouse
from the corner.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.168
Come on.
