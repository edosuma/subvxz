01:00.884 --> 01:02.443
Alright
Bobby, take care.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.164
Felix, we're up.

01:32.921 --> 01:35.679
AOP, red stamp reports

01:35.681 --> 01:39.119
overseeing officer for
housing assignments.

01:39.121 --> 01:41.719
All I can
do in here is count.

01:41.721 --> 01:46.481
The weekly ODs, the daily
assaults, the 14 murders.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.277
The thought of your face
is my only distraction,

01:51.279 --> 01:53.719
that and the constant hustle
it takes to write you.

01:54.839 --> 01:56.956
Every cent of every
stamp is hard-won

01:56.958 --> 01:58.477
and every minute I
don't hear from you

01:58.479 --> 02:00.439
feels like another
10 year sentence.

02:01.678 --> 02:02.476
Where are you?

02:02.478 --> 02:03.278
I'm counting on you.

02:04.279 --> 02:05.599
I can't stop counting.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.236
While you let me rot in
here, think about that.

02:12.238 --> 02:15.318
I saved you, now it's your
turn, you fuckin' owe me.

02:20.798 --> 02:22.278
Alright, let's
see what y'all got.

02:24.796 --> 02:25.597
Bullets.

02:28.637 --> 02:30.357
You done, take a walk.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.154
What, you got a
problem with my money?

02:34.156 --> 02:35.554
Fool, what money?

02:35.556 --> 02:38.674
I won every stamp you got,
maybe I should write your girl.

02:38.676 --> 02:39.914
Punches no longer
accepted, huh?

02:39.916 --> 02:42.113
Man, you in some darkness.

02:42.115 --> 02:44.955
But if you wanna bet that
pretty face, go right ahead.

02:57.914 --> 03:00.233
Let's see how good your
bluff is, now.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.466
Why you outta breath?

04:09.468 --> 04:10.268
Asthma.

04:11.149 --> 04:12.626
Got an inhaler?

04:12.628 --> 04:13.668
It ain't like that.

04:15.748 --> 04:17.267
Undiagnosed asthma, huh?

04:18.387 --> 04:20.464
Not running from the
scene of a murder?

04:20.466 --> 04:21.427
Who been murdered?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.384
Dumb motherfucker.

04:26.386 --> 04:27.387
Everyone hold up.

04:37.825 --> 04:40.104
What's your name, officer?

04:40.106 --> 04:41.107
Tera Sharpe.

04:42.305 --> 04:44.303
Right, you're
Gerald's daughter.

04:44.305 --> 04:45.104
Yes, Captain.

04:46.625 --> 04:50.063
Well Tera, the coroner's
calling this one a suicide.

04:50.065 --> 04:51.944
Captain, check his
boots, there's blood.

04:51.946 --> 04:54.143
You don't have to
prove anything to me.

04:54.145 --> 04:56.061
You're Gerald's kid,
I'm sure you got skills

04:56.063 --> 04:58.421
but I got experience,
which tells me

04:58.423 --> 05:01.741
that if you collar this fool
and collect all your evidence

05:01.743 --> 05:05.422
and so on and so on, it's not
gonna lead to a conviction.

05:05.424 --> 05:07.341
It's just gonna get fucked up.

05:07.343 --> 05:08.862
So what happens to the victim?

05:08.864 --> 05:12.622
The victim was serving three
consecutive life sentences,

05:12.624 --> 05:14.461
he was gonna die in here anyway.

05:14.463 --> 05:16.300
And this chump
gets to go free?

05:16.302 --> 05:19.620
Oh, he'll get
punished, just not by us.

05:19.622 --> 05:22.220
He's part of a
circle of death now.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.500
Whatever beef he had
that made him kill,

05:24.502 --> 05:26.300
it's gonna come
back to him somehow.

05:26.302 --> 05:27.743
Then he's gonna end up losing.

05:29.141 --> 05:31.901
Just let nature take it's
course, it's more efficient.

05:33.981 --> 05:34.781
We cool?

05:37.900 --> 05:38.701
Yeah.

05:41.660 --> 05:44.020
False alarm, release him.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.300
Deal me in, few minutes left.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.657
Every time you lose, my
fist lose mercy, motherfucker.

06:01.659 --> 06:02.858
Teach you how to punch.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.099
Well let's up it up, then.

07:11.094 --> 07:12.052
I already got him, Alexa.

07:12.054 --> 07:13.293
Yeah, he's clean.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.013
- I got six days.
- That's right, baby.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.970
Can't you get me something
for these fuckin' shakes?

07:30.972 --> 07:33.611
Problems ain't gonna be
fixed with pills, takes faith.

07:34.930 --> 07:38.249
Man, look around,
you in prison.

07:38.251 --> 07:39.489
Fuck faith.

07:58.648 --> 07:59.929
Hey, you got mail.

08:13.129 --> 08:14.448
Son of a bitch.

08:24.046 --> 08:24.845
Fuck!

08:30.127 --> 08:31.126
Cut it out.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.684
I said shut the fuck up.

08:49.644 --> 08:51.884
I know you from somewhere.

08:53.645 --> 08:56.045
Get used to it,
it only gets louder.

09:47.559 --> 09:52.359
♪ Happy birthday Vanessa ♪

09:53.520 --> 09:56.719
♪ Have a happy birthday ♪

09:58.159 --> 10:00.197
We're sorry, the
number you have reached is...

10:03.479 --> 10:05.156
I know she's thinking
about me just the way

10:05.158 --> 10:07.477
I'm thinking about her, I just
don't know how to find her.

10:07.479 --> 10:09.239
Seems she don't
wanna hear from ya.

10:10.118 --> 10:11.196
I love her.

10:11.198 --> 10:12.998
When you love
something, you chase it.

10:14.359 --> 10:16.918
What if you chasin' something
that ain't even there?

10:18.237 --> 10:20.675
See, we on the inside
get stuck in time

10:20.677 --> 10:21.955
thinkin' that the
rest of the world

10:21.957 --> 10:25.116
is on pause but it
ain't, we paused.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.877
Them on the outside are on play.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.276
This here is your life now.

10:31.837 --> 10:33.154
I'm telling you to find peace

10:33.156 --> 10:35.594
in what you got,
not what's missing.

10:35.596 --> 10:36.395
Preach it.

10:38.275 --> 10:39.196
How'd I know I'd
find you out here?

10:41.395 --> 10:42.794
You wander away
from my poppy fields

10:42.796 --> 10:45.555
and now look at ya,
man without a country.

10:47.116 --> 10:50.514
I hear you got 12
days clean, ups.

10:52.195 --> 10:52.994
Thanks.

10:56.513 --> 10:57.552
Yo, hold up.

11:00.634 --> 11:01.473
No disrespect.

11:03.514 --> 11:05.474
This here would
be Continental.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.232
What they call you?

11:11.072 --> 11:12.190
Lee.

11:12.192 --> 11:13.390
Best orderly in the joint,

11:13.392 --> 11:15.671
got me off that
poison you slang.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.273
A miracle worker, huh?

11:18.592 --> 11:20.991
- Stealin' my best customer.
- Ease up.

11:20.993 --> 11:23.269
My man is stingin',
his girl just left him.

11:23.271 --> 11:25.469
Came to Jules for
some schoolin'.

11:25.471 --> 11:27.109
Told me to give up.

11:27.111 --> 11:28.752
- That what you heard?
- Give,

11:29.911 --> 11:32.190
won't be seein' that
word in my memoirs.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.472
There's too much to take.

11:39.310 --> 11:40.471
Much love for ya, Jules.

11:55.309 --> 11:57.108
Mm mm, don't even.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.067
He ain't the one to listen to.

11:59.069 --> 12:01.467
Seems like a man
who gets things done.

12:01.469 --> 12:04.188
Sure, got his ducks in a row.

12:05.829 --> 12:07.187
Ducks?

12:07.189 --> 12:09.345
Yeah, ducks.

12:09.347 --> 12:11.468
Like quack quack
motherfuckin' ducks.

12:13.748 --> 12:18.508
Ducks are COs that get sucker
til they under a con's thumb.

12:19.668 --> 12:21.144
That's how he gets
the heroin, then.

12:21.146 --> 12:24.347
One foot inside with us,
one in the outside world.

12:26.867 --> 12:30.107
Whatever you're thinkin',
stay away from that man.

12:35.866 --> 12:37.305
You stay away from this shit.

12:51.305 --> 12:54.143
I don't wanna spend a
lot of time on specifics

12:54.145 --> 12:57.025
because it's the bigger picture
I want you to worry about.

12:58.384 --> 13:01.063
Curt Martin was arrested today
for narcotics trafficking.

13:02.463 --> 13:05.582
We all know it was his undue
familiarity with the inmates

13:05.584 --> 13:08.824
that led to such a charge,
he'll be punished accordingly.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.624
Good man, Captain.

13:11.743 --> 13:13.781
Okay, I don't
know about y'all,

13:13.783 --> 13:15.982
but I'm ready to wake
up from that nightmare.

13:17.543 --> 13:19.060
Let's face some facts,

13:19.062 --> 13:22.542
we have 100 officers
for 1,000 prisoners.

13:23.942 --> 13:27.260
Now, as CO Martin showed us
all, you can easily get lost

13:27.262 --> 13:29.622
if you get too close
and lose perspective.

13:30.582 --> 13:32.261
This place is a fuckin' jungle.

14:06.939 --> 14:08.818
I come bearing gifts.

14:17.058 --> 14:18.617
They ain't Gucci, but

14:23.217 --> 14:25.175
good lookin' out.

14:25.177 --> 14:28.497
Alright, I got
shit to attend to.

14:31.217 --> 14:33.374
Thought about
what you said to me.

14:33.376 --> 14:34.496
I'm gonna go after her.

14:36.536 --> 14:37.336
God bless.

14:40.015 --> 14:40.935
I want your help.

14:42.896 --> 14:43.695
With what?

14:46.175 --> 14:48.415
Gettin' out of here.

14:51.055 --> 14:52.255
What you know about me?

14:54.495 --> 14:56.172
Actually, I don't
know anything.

14:56.174 --> 14:59.971
Yet here you are asking
me to commit a felony.

14:59.973 --> 15:00.852
Man, I just thought we could

15:00.854 --> 15:02.253
- work this out.
- Bounce.

15:02.255 --> 15:03.691
And quit peddling
me shit like some

15:03.693 --> 15:06.572
Nigerian prince with
a Yahoo account.

15:06.574 --> 15:09.211
If you ever step to
me again like that,

15:09.213 --> 15:10.930
I'm gonna come down
to that infirmary,

15:10.932 --> 15:14.091
grab a syringe and stick your
carotid with it, dead center.

15:14.093 --> 15:16.534
Boom, air bubble
fuckin' embolism.

15:21.133 --> 15:22.693
This is my Zen garden.

15:25.413 --> 15:27.052
Not a single piece of paper.

15:29.732 --> 15:31.770
Know how I've got
15 years on the job?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.690
By not letting a
soul fuck with it.

15:36.891 --> 15:41.091
Your father taught me that,
he was a mentor of mine.

15:44.450 --> 15:47.331
He taught me something
crucial to my success here,

15:48.690 --> 15:52.807
there are lines drawn in sand
and lines drawn in concrete

15:52.809 --> 15:56.369
and to have a career here, you
need to know the difference.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.968
What do you know
about Curt Martin?

16:00.969 --> 16:03.850
Beyond what you said at
roll call, nothing really.

16:04.809 --> 16:05.689
Lot of rumors.

16:06.929 --> 16:08.408
I had him on midnight crew.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.328
Post with a lot of autonomy,
thought he could handle it

16:13.767 --> 16:14.688
and it buried him.

16:17.687 --> 16:19.367
I trust you won't
have that problem

16:21.367 --> 16:22.447
when you take it over.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.166
Thank you, Captain.

16:26.447 --> 16:30.085
Congratulations, run
it clean and it'll prove

16:30.087 --> 16:32.125
an excellent springboard
for advancement.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.366
- Make your daddy proud.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.123
Remember about the Zen garden.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.524
Don't worry, I
won't fuck it up.

16:41.526 --> 16:42.646
That a girl.

16:49.324 --> 16:50.124
Dad?

16:53.444 --> 16:54.245
Dad?

16:59.644 --> 17:00.444
The fuck?

17:02.164 --> 17:02.964
Daddy?

17:05.124 --> 17:06.684
You left the door open again.

17:09.323 --> 17:11.284
Oh, we'll
fix this, yeah.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.480
Come on, watch it, you got this.

17:17.482 --> 17:18.282
Dad?

17:19.962 --> 17:22.601
Pesticide,
Weed-B-Gon, fertilizer.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.199
What are you talkin' about?

17:25.201 --> 17:27.400
I tried everything, I tried
everything but the flowers.

17:27.402 --> 17:28.639
Do you want them
out of the ground?

17:28.641 --> 17:30.960
No, I didn't have
a choice, god dammit.

17:30.962 --> 17:31.762
Had no choice.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.361
This is my house, too.

18:19.797 --> 18:21.155
Up.

18:22.117 --> 18:23.515
What am I fuckin' doing here?

18:23.517 --> 18:25.916
Stop actin' like a bitch,
this ain't about you.

18:25.918 --> 18:28.517
You need to save my
cat, she's ODing.

18:31.037 --> 18:31.837
On what?

18:32.676 --> 18:33.477
Heroin.

18:35.117 --> 18:36.877
How did that happen?

18:39.676 --> 18:41.914
I don't know how to treat this.

18:41.916 --> 18:43.793
Jules said you were
some kinda medicine man.

18:43.795 --> 18:44.793
It's a cat.

18:44.795 --> 18:46.552
She's still a mammal, yo.

18:46.554 --> 18:49.312
Just give her the
human shit, just less.

18:57.634 --> 18:58.835
How much did she take?

19:00.194 --> 19:01.072
A lot.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.234
Come on, hurry up.

19:03.554 --> 19:04.711
I'll need supplies
from the infirmary.

19:04.713 --> 19:06.593
Yeah, Felix'll take you.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.314
Come on.

19:09.913 --> 19:11.352
But you'll make it up to me.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.311
Fine.

19:13.313 --> 19:14.113
Go.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.673
You haven't heard
what I want yet.

19:18.513 --> 19:19.353
Fuck.

19:22.872 --> 19:24.229
Speak it.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.469
Same thing I wanted last
time, midnight train outta here.

19:26.471 --> 19:28.590
What am I, Harriet Tubman?

19:28.592 --> 19:29.829
What I need from your
man is that it gets...

19:29.831 --> 19:30.631
No.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.391
Felix is still a duckling.

19:35.831 --> 19:37.429
He ain't got the
fat or the feathers

19:37.431 --> 19:39.148
for something like that.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.589
Even if he did, you
think he'd risk his job,

19:41.591 --> 19:44.590
his healthcare, his
motherfuckin' pension for you?

19:45.670 --> 19:47.707
The man's got a family, yo.

19:50.710 --> 19:51.987
We all got things we love.

19:51.989 --> 19:54.388
Yeah, you find your own duck

19:54.390 --> 19:56.830
and I'll help you down him
into a golden goose, hm?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.306
Now save my fuckin' cat.

20:11.909 --> 20:14.149
What I need's in that bag.

20:53.824 --> 20:57.382
We even, 'cause my
wife's probably waitin'.

20:57.384 --> 20:58.262
What?

20:58.264 --> 20:59.783
My wife's waiting for me.

20:59.785 --> 21:01.263
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, go.

21:03.344 --> 21:05.344
Hey, good lookin' out, friend.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.623
- Yeah, thanks.
- Go.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.701
That's my gangstress.

21:33.980 --> 21:34.781
Yeah.

21:41.261 --> 21:46.060
If it looks like shit

21:47.180 --> 21:51.699
and it smells like
shit, it might be dope.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.418
Yo, how about my
end of the bargain?

21:55.420 --> 21:57.420
You need to find some
feathers to ruffle.

21:58.339 --> 21:59.139
I got some.

22:00.899 --> 22:02.218
Tera Sharpe?

22:02.220 --> 22:04.939
Rumor is you know her
from somewhere else.

22:05.979 --> 22:07.379
She works midnight crew now.

22:08.298 --> 22:09.218
Midnight crew.

22:10.378 --> 22:12.935
How the hell am I gonna
get on midnight crew?

22:12.937 --> 22:15.895
You did good
tonight, I got you.

22:57.975 --> 22:58.774
Chill, lady.

23:00.375 --> 23:04.614
I think that overdose fucked
her up, she's so needy now.

23:08.294 --> 23:10.533
Anyways, congratulations.

23:12.490 --> 23:12.413
Look at this shit.

23:14.774 --> 23:15.973
I think she's done.

23:17.413 --> 23:19.211
So why the congratulations?

23:19.213 --> 23:22.011
You're gettin' transferred
to midnight crew.

23:22.013 --> 23:23.252
Time to get your dick wet.

23:24.292 --> 23:25.690
Any advice?

23:25.692 --> 23:28.369
The only difference between
downin' a duck and makin'

23:28.371 --> 23:31.611
a friend is what you're
lookin' to get in the end.

23:32.851 --> 23:34.049
I'm lookin' to get out,

23:34.051 --> 23:37.650
but don't I need some
kind of escape plan?

23:37.652 --> 23:42.368
You
duck shorty right,

23:42.370 --> 23:45.128
and she'll be the one
comin' to you with a plan.

23:45.130 --> 23:47.968
Midnight crew will give
you room to operate.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.370
You'll have her and this
whole joint to yourself.

23:51.969 --> 23:54.489
Get her believin' you
deserve to be free.

23:55.929 --> 23:59.646
Check out a CO handbook, every
rule you can get her to break

23:59.648 --> 24:01.729
is leverage in case
she don't take to you.

24:04.848 --> 24:08.448
Meow this, meow that, it's
gettin' on my fuckin' nerves.

24:12.807 --> 24:15.287
I think it's best you take her.

24:24.007 --> 24:28.807
Good luck, yo.

24:52.804 --> 24:54.602
Heartlock High,
that's how I know you.

24:54.604 --> 24:55.723
Hands in pockets.

25:00.485 --> 25:02.124
We were in high
school together.

25:04.443 --> 25:05.761
You don't remember that?

25:05.763 --> 25:07.641
I was class of '08, so
you must have been what?

25:07.643 --> 25:10.041
- Class of '09 or something?
- Stop.

25:23.962 --> 25:25.639
Alright, you boys
know the drill.

25:25.641 --> 25:26.880
Just do your thing.

25:26.882 --> 25:29.240
You, garbage detail.

25:29.242 --> 25:30.479
Tera Sharpe, right?

25:30.481 --> 25:32.159
No first names.

25:32.161 --> 25:33.359
The girl that always wore

25:33.361 --> 25:34.881
different colored
ribbons in her hair.

25:37.881 --> 25:40.918
I am not that girl,
I am not a girl,

25:40.920 --> 25:42.558
I am your CO and
you're an inmate

25:42.560 --> 25:44.759
so stop fucking talking
to me like you know me.

25:44.761 --> 25:46.039
Alright.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.519
Just never thought
I'd see you in here.

25:48.521 --> 25:51.640
Funny, 'cause I always
knew you'd end up in here.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.159
Hey, move.

26:03.758 --> 26:05.398
So you do remember me.

26:09.677 --> 26:10.476
Shit.

26:17.118 --> 26:20.354
Hey princess, don't
go past the dumpsters,

26:20.356 --> 26:21.677
they'll shoot your ass.

26:23.397 --> 26:24.197
Fuck.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.316
Hey, was that good for you?

26:34.196 --> 26:34.997
Laughing at me?

26:37.155 --> 26:39.356
Get your fucking hands
up against that wall.

26:42.116 --> 26:42.916
Tera.

26:46.955 --> 26:48.115
- What did you call me?
- CO.

26:51.115 --> 26:53.353
How long do I have to stay here?

26:53.355 --> 26:54.275
Til I say so.

27:14.392 --> 27:15.193
Goodnight.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.628
I'm sorry about last night,

27:41.630 --> 27:43.150
didn't mean to get you riled up.

27:48.391 --> 27:49.710
Hey, why don't you like me?

27:50.829 --> 27:53.227
Did I do something to
you back in the day?

27:53.229 --> 27:54.669
Turned your back on society.

27:55.990 --> 28:00.226
Come on, that's
like straight outta the manual.

28:00.228 --> 28:01.587
But your attitude,
that's personal.

28:01.589 --> 28:03.506
- Oh really?
- Mm hm.

28:03.508 --> 28:04.628
Please, enlighten me.

28:05.949 --> 28:08.347
I don't know, I'm
thinkin' maybe it's 'cause

28:08.349 --> 28:12.348
I knew you on the outside,
you know I've seen you smile.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.187
Oh really?

28:15.627 --> 28:19.467
You used to have a nice
smile, what happened?

28:21.066 --> 28:22.267
Break's over.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.904
- You know how snakes hunt?
- No.

28:32.906 --> 28:34.624
They taste
chemicals in the air,

28:34.626 --> 28:37.863
detecting every little
change, it's very precise.

28:37.865 --> 28:39.503
Nothin' gets by them.

28:39.505 --> 28:41.744
Are we gonna talk
business or what?

28:41.746 --> 28:43.145
The shade best be clean.

28:44.546 --> 28:45.863
No doubt.

28:45.865 --> 28:47.066
I chose the wrong duck.

28:48.945 --> 28:50.463
I can't get through to
her, her walls are up.

28:50.465 --> 28:52.303
You gotta find what's
in a person's soul

28:52.305 --> 28:54.023
before you can possess 'em.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.144
She won't talk to me.

28:56.224 --> 28:57.943
Maybe you just ain't
really listening.

28:59.385 --> 29:01.421
He has early onset Alzheimer's,

29:01.423 --> 29:04.582
he's in no position to
make decisions like that.

29:04.584 --> 29:07.223
All I'm asking is that
you call me first, Tom.

29:08.543 --> 29:11.181
I had to climb through a
window and he nearly shot me.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.820
I know he's your best friend,
but he's my father god dammit.

29:14.822 --> 29:18.020
I spent my life stuck in
this town taking care of him.

29:18.022 --> 29:21.903
Show me some respect, that's
all I'm asking, thank you.

29:24.103 --> 29:26.380
You and her ain't so different,

29:26.382 --> 29:28.422
you're both lookin'
to escape something.

29:30.742 --> 29:33.061
Yeah, I can work with that.

30:26.057 --> 30:26.857
Fuck!

30:30.017 --> 30:30.817
Shit.

30:33.616 --> 30:34.815
What happened?

30:36.296 --> 30:37.696
Cut it on a piece of metal.

30:46.656 --> 30:47.496
Thanks for this.

30:52.495 --> 30:54.415
Shit, this is
deeper than I thought.

30:55.493 --> 30:56.613
You might need stitches.

30:56.615 --> 30:57.534
No, I'll be fine.

30:58.933 --> 31:00.095
Will you just bandage it?

31:01.693 --> 31:05.053
Come on, I don't wanna
go to the infirmary.

31:09.213 --> 31:11.413
Hold this, I need to
tie it with something.

31:13.772 --> 31:14.572
Your.

31:17.691 --> 31:18.492
Oh yeah.

31:30.811 --> 31:32.290
You're pretty good at this.

31:32.292 --> 31:33.531
Make a good nurse.

31:35.051 --> 31:36.211
I'd never do that job.

31:37.371 --> 31:38.171
Why not?

31:40.650 --> 31:41.490
Hate hospitals.

31:45.331 --> 31:47.689
Last time I was in one
was at the San Onofre Bluffs

31:47.691 --> 31:48.730
on the Pacific coast.

31:51.288 --> 31:51.567
For a cut like this, actually,

31:51.569 --> 31:53.449
I stepped on a piece
of broken sea glass.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.608
Must be nice.

31:55.610 --> 31:56.409
Yeah.

31:57.328 --> 31:58.688
Was an adventure.

32:01.368 --> 32:02.169
What?

32:03.968 --> 32:06.807
We're just
different, that's all.

32:08.847 --> 32:09.648
How?

32:11.129 --> 32:13.448
You're one of
those guys, y'know?

32:14.847 --> 32:18.486
Who just does whatever he wants
like everything'll work out.

32:18.488 --> 32:20.965
Is that why you're
giving me such a hard time?

32:20.967 --> 32:22.406
You think?

32:22.408 --> 32:24.124
That you would turn
your back on everything

32:24.126 --> 32:25.884
and everyone if it
cramped your style?

32:25.886 --> 32:27.526
Yeah, pretty much.

32:33.565 --> 32:35.727
CO, you gotta come see this.

32:36.646 --> 32:37.445
Shit.

32:52.724 --> 32:54.165
- What's going on?
- Fuck.

33:02.325 --> 33:05.361
Red pin, freezer two, red pin.

33:05.363 --> 33:09.243
Fucked up, man.

33:20.402 --> 33:22.482
See, what'd I tell you?

33:23.522 --> 33:24.561
Circle of death.

33:25.642 --> 33:26.801
Okay, off the wall.

33:28.562 --> 33:31.120
Let this be a lesson
to all of y'all,

33:31.122 --> 33:35.159
remember who are and
where you belong.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.880
Alright, move out.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.479
- How 'bout this for leverage?
- What you goin'

33:45.481 --> 33:46.677
for with that?

33:46.679 --> 33:51.118
Article two, section
five, paragraph six.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.598
Exactly.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.278
Article of personal
value exchanged

33:54.280 --> 33:55.839
between staff member and inmate.

33:57.358 --> 33:59.437
Okay, you got yourself a prop.

33:59.439 --> 34:00.878
You got a story to go with that?

34:00.880 --> 34:03.237
Yeah, I cut my own fucking
hand to get her to touch me,

34:03.239 --> 34:04.876
she ended up giving it
to me as a tourniquet.

34:04.878 --> 34:08.195
Nah, circumstance ain't story.

34:08.197 --> 34:12.956
Peep this, me and Tera
were in the nasty.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.755
She ripped that
ribbon from her hair,

34:14.757 --> 34:16.916
wrapped my hands up
in it and took my dick

34:16.918 --> 34:18.478
in her mouth and
said.

34:20.717 --> 34:23.114
- Lie about it?
- Make it truth,

34:23.117 --> 34:25.275
make it emotional,
make her yours.

34:25.277 --> 34:26.877
- Gabos!
- Gabos, what?

34:27.956 --> 34:29.916
Giving ain't
based on sympathy.

34:32.397 --> 34:33.353
Yeah.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.512
Nigga, I'm talkin'
'bout goin' straight.

34:50.514 --> 34:52.274
A regular fuckin' job.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.351
The hell you talkin' about?

34:55.353 --> 34:57.232
Jewelry, start
sellin' jewelry.

34:57.234 --> 34:58.873
Aw man, I'm away from it.

34:58.875 --> 35:01.671
Just me in that bed squeakin'.

35:01.673 --> 35:04.272
Oh, you talkin' 'bout
wildin' the jewelry stuff, man.

35:04.274 --> 35:05.592
That's what I'm sayin'.

35:05.594 --> 35:07.272
Get away with all that
motherfuckin' jewelry

35:07.274 --> 35:10.154
and never get caught,
we won't get caught.

35:11.473 --> 35:12.953
Think about that one, man.

35:14.353 --> 35:17.233
Make sure do somethin'
good, though.

35:18.313 --> 35:19.193
Aight, Sweet.

35:26.312 --> 35:27.792
Do you have my ribbon?

35:31.752 --> 35:33.190
What ribbon?

35:33.192 --> 35:34.710
The one I used on your cut.

35:36.752 --> 35:38.548
Didn't I give it back to you?

35:38.550 --> 35:39.430
Pretty sure I did.

35:41.070 --> 35:42.471
Pretty sure you didn't.

35:43.871 --> 35:46.068
What, you don't trust me?

35:46.070 --> 35:47.109
Or don't you remember?

35:48.629 --> 35:49.910
Are you normally forgetful?

35:54.790 --> 35:55.948
I know you hate hospitals,

35:55.950 --> 35:57.830
but maybe you should
get that checked out.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.149
Come on, I'm not a bad guy.

36:04.268 --> 36:05.508
Stop fuckin' with me.

36:07.787 --> 36:09.508
Stop assuming
the worst about me.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.183
She took you to
find this girl that you

36:55.185 --> 36:57.581
were staying with, you
don't wanna spend more time

36:57.583 --> 36:59.941
in prison than you
have to, do ya?

36:59.943 --> 37:00.824
No.

37:02.144 --> 37:03.862
If you tell us where
she is, we can help you.

37:03.864 --> 37:08.224
I already told you, Lily
had nothing to do with this.

37:28.582 --> 37:30.941
So you been in Heartlock
ever since graduation?

37:35.261 --> 37:36.061
Nice try.

37:39.901 --> 37:41.178
What?

37:41.180 --> 37:42.378
We're not friends,

37:42.380 --> 37:44.020
I don't talk about my
personal life with you.

37:45.980 --> 37:48.821
Fine, let's talk
about mine then.

37:56.139 --> 37:58.379
Do you remember Lily Thomas?

38:04.419 --> 38:06.019
We started dating
in high school,

38:09.659 --> 38:11.976
both our parents were fucked up

38:11.978 --> 38:13.816
so we got the hell outta there.

38:13.818 --> 38:17.495
No money, no plan, but we
had each other, y'know?

38:17.497 --> 38:19.816
Made it all the
way to California.

38:19.818 --> 38:21.175
You have no idea
how beautiful it is

38:21.177 --> 38:24.497
to see the whole country
whiz by at 120 miles an hour.

38:26.976 --> 38:30.537
Man, I got to travel, got
to be in love, to be free.

38:33.336 --> 38:34.494
Just thinking about that gets me

38:34.496 --> 38:36.056
through the day to day here.

38:41.336 --> 38:43.415
How do you get through it?

38:45.135 --> 38:47.816
Like I always do, I
just get through it.

38:49.895 --> 38:50.696
Sounds shitty.

38:52.294 --> 38:53.812
Happens.

38:53.814 --> 38:54.614
What?

38:55.614 --> 38:57.172
Shit.

38:57.174 --> 38:59.533
Must have,

39:00.694 --> 39:02.374
seems both you and I
ended up in prison.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.769
So the third con pulls
out a bunch of tampons.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.809
So the
second con goes

39:35.811 --> 39:37.849
well what the fuck
can you do with those?

39:37.851 --> 39:40.728
Third con goes well
according to the box,

39:40.730 --> 39:43.569
I can go swimming or bike
riding or roller skating.

39:49.609 --> 39:51.090
Oh, you're laughing with me now?

40:01.848 --> 40:05.727
You and I are both just
people sharing the same planet.

40:06.888 --> 40:08.726
I've been through a divorce,

40:08.728 --> 40:11.205
I know what a good lawyer costs.

40:11.207 --> 40:14.165
But I also know that I just hate

40:14.167 --> 40:16.647
to see you get burned
by the legal system.

40:17.567 --> 40:19.365
You got a good referral?

40:19.367 --> 40:22.045
I'll do you one better,
I'll get you half off.

40:22.047 --> 40:25.046
I know this guy, he's
handled many of my affairs.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.325
I wouldn't say he owes
me anything per se,

40:27.327 --> 40:31.444
but accommodations
could be made if.

40:31.446 --> 40:32.844
If what?

40:32.846 --> 40:35.643
If you handle that package
thing I mentioned a while back.

40:35.645 --> 40:37.965
Can't you just
get another cat?

40:39.166 --> 40:40.205
You think it's easy?

40:41.965 --> 40:44.402
Lala's retired,
she's outta the game

40:44.404 --> 40:47.365
so I'm pulling
you off the bench.

40:49.084 --> 40:50.325
You should be thanking me.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.522
For what?

40:52.524 --> 40:55.444
Okay, let's not get
into who owes who.

40:56.603 --> 41:00.521
What matters is you
and I is friends,

41:00.523 --> 41:04.201
I care about you which is
why I'll be there to help you

41:04.203 --> 41:07.281
when you need it seeing as
you're helping me right now.

41:07.283 --> 41:09.441
With those packages,
just look for the ones

41:09.443 --> 41:11.882
addressed to my Christian
name, Kirkland Bosta.

41:13.202 --> 41:15.160
But the logs, you know
and they screen all the time

41:15.162 --> 41:16.842
and it just, it looks sketchy.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.480
Look, what about
my pension, man?

41:19.482 --> 41:22.842
Felix, that's why
I have you there.

41:23.961 --> 41:26.601
I trust you, you
can handle it, hm?

41:28.801 --> 41:30.242
You can handle it.

41:32.802 --> 41:33.762
Yeah, go on.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.361
Hey, come here.

41:49.959 --> 41:50.759
Come here.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.316
Felix buggin' on me.

41:55.318 --> 41:56.197
Felix?

41:56.199 --> 41:58.197
Yeah motherfucker, Felix.

41:58.199 --> 42:00.197
Seems pretty sucker to me.

42:00.199 --> 42:02.918
They always do
until they ain't.

42:39.955 --> 42:41.475
That last package turned red.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.472
- Huh?
- You put it

42:43.474 --> 42:44.356
in the cleared bin.

42:45.794 --> 42:46.595
Did I?

42:58.475 --> 42:59.393
Fuckin' machines.

43:00.753 --> 43:03.233
I'm tellin' ya, man, this
place is going to shit.

43:08.754 --> 43:12.470
It's like he knew
exactly what I was doing.

43:12.472 --> 43:13.953
Freaked me the fuck out, man.

43:15.432 --> 43:19.949
I just, I don't wanna end
up like Curt Martin, y'know?

43:19.951 --> 43:22.231
You know what they do to law
enforcement in the joint.

43:22.233 --> 43:24.990
Don't be cryin' no
rivers about Martin.

43:24.992 --> 43:26.591
He brought that shit on himself.

43:27.672 --> 43:29.190
How?

43:29.192 --> 43:31.510
It's not like either one
of us signed up for this.

43:31.512 --> 43:34.070
No, the skeletons
in your closet did.

43:36.191 --> 43:38.429
I didn't have any
skeletons til I met you.

44:10.587 --> 44:11.387
Hey.

44:23.867 --> 44:24.666
Sit.

44:31.507 --> 44:35.266
Those letters you got
back, they were from Lily?

44:37.267 --> 44:38.065
Mm hm.

44:39.346 --> 44:41.666
After we got back from
California, we were squatting,

44:43.225 --> 44:44.862
never knew where we
were gonna end up next

44:44.864 --> 44:47.825
so I opened a P.O. box in
case we ever got separated.

44:49.745 --> 44:51.265
That's where I sent the letters.

44:53.025 --> 44:55.064
You were worried
about getting separated.

44:56.343 --> 44:58.741
Well yeah, we knocked
off half a dozen

44:58.743 --> 45:00.064
convenience stores together.

45:01.624 --> 45:03.422
You told the police that you

45:03.424 --> 45:04.983
were the only one responsible.

45:07.783 --> 45:11.222
I looked at your file the
other day, saw your confession.

45:15.062 --> 45:18.142
Well that's just what you
do when you love someone.

45:22.582 --> 45:23.463
Suffer for them?

45:27.861 --> 45:29.302
I know what that's like.

45:31.382 --> 45:33.461
Better to have
loved and lost, right?

45:41.620 --> 45:43.860
I'm not like you,
I'm not a risk taker.

45:44.779 --> 45:45.579
Why?

45:51.980 --> 45:55.939
I guess I hate to lose,
it's just how I was raised.

45:58.980 --> 46:00.498
Lily taught me
that playing safe

46:00.500 --> 46:03.499
was worse than losing,
there's no room to win.

46:07.219 --> 46:08.497
You two sound dangerous.

46:10.978 --> 46:12.536
Yeah.

46:12.538 --> 46:14.216
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

46:45.815 --> 46:48.332
Hey, Officer Tera Sharpe,
New York State Corrections.

46:48.334 --> 46:50.014
I called you about
the Thomas file.

47:54.089 --> 47:54.889
Hey.

47:57.689 --> 47:59.488
There's something
I wanna tell you.

48:00.729 --> 48:02.207
Oh yeah?

48:02.209 --> 48:03.409
I went looking for her.

48:05.929 --> 48:06.727
Lily?

48:11.288 --> 48:13.406
Something happen to her?

48:13.408 --> 48:15.127
No, it's not like that.

48:17.928 --> 48:19.928
She's the reason
you're in here, Lee.

48:23.247 --> 48:24.046
What?

48:25.007 --> 48:26.087
She ratted you out.

48:28.807 --> 48:29.607
Here.

48:32.166 --> 48:32.966
I'm sorry.

48:34.126 --> 48:35.725
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

48:37.406 --> 48:39.725
You wanted to find
out where she is.

48:45.045 --> 48:45.964
That's where she is.

49:14.882 --> 49:18.161
I need you to
come in tomorrow.

49:18.163 --> 49:21.043
I got a fragile package coming
that needs your soft hands.

49:23.121 --> 49:25.120
- Yeah, but tomorrow's...
- Y'know, all I get from you

49:25.122 --> 49:28.800
is buts, negativity like
that kills relationships.

49:28.802 --> 49:31.000
I bet your wife told you
that shit in counseling

49:31.002 --> 49:33.361
but you probably
shut her out, too.

49:42.439 --> 49:43.920
Leadership is complicated.

49:45.799 --> 49:47.439
Why would she
fucking betray me?

49:48.640 --> 49:49.958
Why?

49:49.960 --> 49:52.799
'Cause people be
people, they do shit.

50:01.278 --> 50:02.918
It's like I never
even knew her.

50:05.918 --> 50:10.718
You know, I was in a similar
situation like that once.

50:11.877 --> 50:12.797
And look at me now.

50:14.797 --> 50:16.077
What happened?

50:17.878 --> 50:20.838
I killed her, summer of '91.

50:27.516 --> 50:29.196
That why you're in?

50:30.995 --> 50:32.955
Amongst other wrongs
I've had to right.

50:34.116 --> 50:36.795
What I'm tryin' to
say is I found anger

50:38.876 --> 50:40.516
just about solves everything.

50:42.235 --> 50:44.874
But hey, you know,
that's just me.

50:47.674 --> 50:50.555
Well I ain't like
you, I don't kill.

50:52.435 --> 50:54.434
And I don't get betrayed.

51:02.714 --> 51:05.713
Stuck here every night,
why the fuck am I here?

51:30.192 --> 51:31.872
How you holdin' up?

51:34.551 --> 51:37.909
Got the clientele,
got the employees,

51:37.911 --> 51:39.989
we ain't got us
in shit but bank.

51:39.991 --> 51:41.910
How much money we
talkin' a week, though?

51:42.990 --> 51:44.631
- Quarter mil.
- Straight up?

51:45.470 --> 51:46.430
No bullshit, yo.

51:47.511 --> 51:48.628
What up, Lee?

51:48.630 --> 51:50.670
- Oh, cowboy.
- You alright?

51:52.149 --> 51:53.388
Yeah, I missed.

51:53.390 --> 51:55.030
You alright,
what's goin' on man?

51:56.430 --> 51:58.867
Just getting rid of this shit.

51:58.869 --> 51:59.748
You what?

52:00.749 --> 52:03.907
Just getting rid of this shit.

52:03.909 --> 52:05.786
- I don't really know, man.
- That's right.

52:05.788 --> 52:06.786
- Check this out.
- What you got there?

52:06.788 --> 52:09.507
Oh shit, he's on the sauce?

52:10.588 --> 52:11.506
Oh that's that strong
shit, though, Sweet.

52:11.508 --> 52:13.427
Leave that shit alone, yo.

52:13.429 --> 52:18.065
That's that shit, though.

52:18.067 --> 52:19.987
Lee, not tonight, bro.

52:21.307 --> 52:22.866
Come on, man.

52:22.868 --> 52:25.745
No one wants anything
to do with me, fine.

52:25.747 --> 52:26.864
I don't give a shit.

52:26.866 --> 52:27.665
We
ain't say all that.

52:27.667 --> 52:29.104
Cowboy.

52:29.106 --> 52:32.943
Cowboy, don't call me a
cowboy, you piece of shit.

52:32.945 --> 52:36.143
- Oh, cowboy.
- It's like that?

52:36.145 --> 52:37.065
Lee, Lee?

52:39.065 --> 52:40.344
Yo, get the CO, man.

52:40.346 --> 52:42.383
- What the fuck is he doing?
- CO.

52:44.464 --> 52:45.506
Stop.

52:49.584 --> 52:51.424
Get down on the ground.

52:55.703 --> 52:56.504
Breach.

52:59.464 --> 53:02.543
Officer in pursuit,
tower stand down.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.301
What the fuck are you doing?

53:07.303 --> 53:08.421
Are you fucking crazy?

53:08.423 --> 53:10.542
You could have been killed.

53:12.663 --> 53:15.823
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

53:17.342 --> 53:19.220
She abandoned you, so what?

53:19.222 --> 53:21.262
People have left me, too.

53:23.462 --> 53:24.659
You good?

53:24.661 --> 53:25.461
Come on.

53:28.302 --> 53:30.941
- Inmate under custody.
- Copy that.

53:39.180 --> 53:41.540
I thought love conquers
all or some shit.

53:45.581 --> 53:48.418
Man, there ain't no
one thing that conquers.

53:48.420 --> 53:51.739
You talk about love the way
a junkie talks about smack.

53:57.139 --> 53:58.777
I'm no addict.

53:58.779 --> 54:02.416
Man, call it what you like,
you're an escape artist.

54:02.418 --> 54:03.659
I doubt Lily was blinded.

54:04.978 --> 54:08.058
Love needs to be about more
than running away from the past.

54:23.936 --> 54:25.095
Where's
my goddamn gun?

54:25.097 --> 54:26.535
Dad, stop okay?

54:26.537 --> 54:28.614
We've been robbed.

54:28.616 --> 54:29.975
I gave it back to Tom, okay?

54:29.977 --> 54:32.253
You can't have a gun anymore,
dad, you're too sick.

54:32.255 --> 54:33.734
What?

54:33.736 --> 54:36.454
What, I don't know that?

54:36.456 --> 54:37.416
I know that.

54:38.736 --> 54:42.255
Stop treatin' me like I'm
one of your prisoners.

54:43.655 --> 54:47.973
I mean you wouldn't even be
a CO if it weren't for me.

55:29.251 --> 55:30.051
Thanks.

55:40.251 --> 55:42.569
About the other night.

55:42.571 --> 55:43.531
It's okay.

55:52.930 --> 55:55.730
You said you were
abandoned, too.

55:58.169 --> 55:58.968
Yeah.

56:01.008 --> 56:03.088
My mom left my dad and me.

56:16.447 --> 56:17.408
Goodnight.

56:19.527 --> 56:20.487
Goodnight.

57:08.523 --> 57:09.801
- Hey.
- Hey,

57:09.803 --> 57:11.881
brought some donuts
to the staff room.

57:11.883 --> 57:13.681
Great yeah, I'll grab
some before my shift.

57:13.683 --> 57:14.483
Alright.

58:32.076 --> 58:32.876
Wow.

59:02.514 --> 59:03.474
I'm sorry.

59:05.514 --> 59:10.273
It's okay.

59:12.273 --> 59:13.073
Shall we sit?

59:14.512 --> 59:15.352
Let's eat.

59:59.348 --> 01:00:01.786
Heroin, weed,
crank, all that shit.

01:00:01.788 --> 01:00:04.145
- Fuck that.
- 25 to life, B.

01:00:04.147 --> 01:00:06.345
This ol' greasy
ass dude was there,

01:00:06.347 --> 01:00:09.306
the jake beat his ass in
front of the bodega one time.

01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:10.986
He was high and smokin' shit,

01:00:10.988 --> 01:00:13.706
then he ended up pissin'
on they boots and shit.

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.625
And there was some
winos across the street

01:00:15.627 --> 01:00:16.946
singin' In the
Still of the Night

01:00:16.948 --> 01:00:18.506
while they was workin' his ass,

01:00:18.508 --> 01:00:21.225

01:03:16.013 --> 01:03:16.892
I want out.

01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:20.250
After all the dirt you done?

01:03:20.252 --> 01:03:23.729
I got so much shit
on you, I own you.

01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:26.012
Not if I don't give a
shit if everyone knows.

01:03:27.932 --> 01:03:31.689
You wanna have to tell your
kids that daddy's a drug mule?

01:03:31.691 --> 01:03:32.972
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:03:34.131 --> 01:03:35.810
Sheila says she's
takin' the kids.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:38.888
Did you call that
lawyer I told you about?

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.808
I don't care,
I'm a slave to you.

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:45.928
I'm a slave to Hearst, do
whatever you have to do.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.447
I don't even wanna
be here anymore.

01:03:49.449 --> 01:03:53.090
If that's the way
you really feel, okay.

01:04:44.805 --> 01:04:47.004
Gettin' this far in
my world is a victory.

01:04:47.965 --> 01:04:49.006
Now taste triumph.

01:04:51.445 --> 01:04:52.244
To new lovers.

01:04:55.883 --> 01:04:57.764
Or is she just a
good fuck?

01:05:01.444 --> 01:05:04.243
You got yourself some
powerful leverage, boy.

01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:07.604
Sky's the limit to
what she'll do now.

01:05:09.283 --> 01:05:11.762
So the plan's for me
to drop my dirt on her?

01:05:11.764 --> 01:05:13.240
Exactly.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.881
Then earn your
keep, time to turn

01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:18.402
that bitch's title over
to her rightful owner.

01:05:20.281 --> 01:05:22.560
I got some immediate
uses for her,

01:05:22.562 --> 01:05:25.162
so you're gonna have to
put your plan on hold.

01:05:29.841 --> 01:05:30.641
We good?

01:05:33.321 --> 01:05:34.642
What do you want with her?

01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:37.039
We good.

01:06:03.919 --> 01:06:07.796
Baklava, it's a
Russian fuckin' ski mask

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.276
you pull onto the
top of your face, B.

01:06:09.278 --> 01:06:10.955
Had a Russian bitch named
Sonya that told me that.

01:06:10.957 --> 01:06:12.355
Baklava is motherfuckin'
dessert, man.

01:06:13.238 --> 01:06:14.636
- No, it' ain't.
- Yes it is.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:15.875
- What are you talkin' about?
- That's some great shit.

01:06:15.877 --> 01:06:18.956
Hey Lee, what you
know about baklava?

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.594
Come on, let's go.

01:07:15.753 --> 01:07:17.432
Wait, what is that?

01:07:33.032 --> 01:07:34.232
This is heroin.

01:08:34.185 --> 01:08:35.384
I hear you got
a lot of friends.

01:08:35.386 --> 01:08:36.863
Where they at now?

01:08:56.462 --> 01:08:57.263
What's wrong?

01:09:02.183 --> 01:09:03.702
You deserve better than this.

01:09:06.502 --> 01:09:07.301
I know.

01:09:10.622 --> 01:09:12.582
In another life, we'd
run away together.

01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:23.982
Why in another life?

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:43.260
Thanks, Jules.

01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:46.858
Is there anyone else who would
like to share with us today?

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:59.657
I'd now like to close this
meeting with a moment of silence.

01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:01.977
I think I'm finally
gettin' out of here.

01:10:01.979 --> 01:10:03.099
She's falling hard.

01:10:06.137 --> 01:10:08.337
One thing that
sobriety taught me

01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:13.178
is the reason I started
doin' dope way back when

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:17.418
was because my life had truths
that I couldn't face sober.

01:10:20.218 --> 01:10:21.497
Let me show you something.

01:10:28.736 --> 01:10:29.855
That's my son.

01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:33.816
I had no idea you had kids.

01:10:35.655 --> 01:10:37.255
He's a stranger to me now.

01:10:38.615 --> 01:10:40.215
Won't even take my calls.

01:10:41.336 --> 01:10:42.976
Why don't you try
to call him again?

01:10:46.696 --> 01:10:50.455
My point is I hurt
everyone that ever loved me.

01:10:51.575 --> 01:10:53.493
And until you decide
the kind of man

01:10:53.495 --> 01:10:55.573
you wanna be and
why you're still

01:10:55.575 --> 01:10:58.294
trying to escape,
you'll do the same.

01:11:30.491 --> 01:11:35.091
See if I don't get down like
Nelson Mandela, you bitch.

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.810
You can't break me.

01:12:05.328 --> 01:12:07.087
Now who's the bitch.

01:12:38.286 --> 01:12:39.684
Inmate at Heartlock
Correctional Facility

01:12:39.686 --> 01:12:41.324
is said to be released
from solitary confinement

01:12:41.326 --> 01:12:43.563
after these images of
his severely beaten face.

01:12:43.565 --> 01:12:45.604
Wounds he said he sustained
during an unprovoked attack

01:12:45.606 --> 01:12:48.242
by prison staff
surfaced earlier today.

01:12:48.244 --> 01:12:50.362
The inmate, known by his
street name Continental,

01:12:50.364 --> 01:12:52.043
indicated that he was
able to steal a cellphone

01:12:52.045 --> 01:12:54.243
while being attacked,
then using his camera,

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.482
documented his injuries
while uploading the selfies

01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:58.042
to several social media sites,

01:12:58.044 --> 01:13:00.082
with captions
pleading for his life.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:03.081
Photographs picked up the
attention of the ACLU,

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:04.241
prompting a thunderstorm meeting

01:13:04.243 --> 01:13:06.761
between ACLU lawyers and
the state's attorney.

01:13:06.763 --> 01:13:08.042
Although it's rare for
the state's attorney

01:13:08.044 --> 01:13:09.322
to get involved in
this sort of matter,

01:13:09.324 --> 01:13:11.361
it's not unprecedented,
especially given

01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:12.761
that this is the second
incident this year

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.921
involving alleged
corruption at Heartlock.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.879
The first was the arrest
of Officer Curtis Martin,

01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:19.001
who was charged with
drug trafficking.

01:13:19.003 --> 01:13:20.521
All this leads many to
question of what the crew

01:13:20.523 --> 01:13:21.720
is allowing full
scale corruption

01:13:21.722 --> 01:13:23.242
of the five under her command.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.157
So how the fuck did
I end up in the hole?

01:13:41.159 --> 01:13:44.197
How the fuck did my shit
get took from the mail?

01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:44.999
I don't know.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.721
- Don't play dumb.
- I'm not.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.996
So you think I
should kill Felix?

01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:55.439
He works the mail room,
he was there that night.

01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:59.157
So was your girly, you
think I should kill her?

01:13:59.159 --> 01:14:00.516
No.

01:14:00.518 --> 01:14:02.317
You protectin' her?

01:14:02.319 --> 01:14:05.117
Oh, you don't have
to answer that.

01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:07.356
But you do need to answer me.

01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:09.556
So you use your leverage,

01:14:09.558 --> 01:14:11.558
'cause she don't
belong to you anymore.

01:14:12.517 --> 01:14:14.277
Now bring that bitch to me.

01:14:16.276 --> 01:14:17.675
Where should I go?

01:14:17.677 --> 01:14:20.317
Mail room, you get on
the midnight crew tomorrow.

01:14:22.317 --> 01:14:23.515
Alright, no problem.

01:14:23.517 --> 01:14:26.756
Oh, there is gonna
be a fuckin' problem,

01:14:28.516 --> 01:14:29.356
just ask Felix.

01:15:22.992 --> 01:15:24.472
Know anything about Buddhism?

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:26.592
No.

01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:28.711
Didn't think so.

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:31.751
The Buddhists believe in karma,

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:36.269
a cycle of cause and
effect connectin' us all.

01:15:36.271 --> 01:15:38.029
What you do influences me,

01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:40.630
what I do influences
the next guy and so on.

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:45.547
You caused some shit by
seizing all those drugs.

01:15:45.549 --> 01:15:49.110
A big timer ended up in
the hole, and now he's out.

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:51.390
That's gonna come back at ya.

01:15:54.468 --> 01:15:56.587
You need to watch your back.

01:15:56.589 --> 01:16:00.349
If you have any vacation time,
now's a good time to take it.

01:16:11.028 --> 01:16:13.666
Let's run away together.

01:16:13.668 --> 01:16:14.468
Now?

01:16:16.427 --> 01:16:19.867
Why be stuck in here when
I can be free with you?

01:16:27.706 --> 01:16:29.465
You'd lose your job.

01:16:30.306 --> 01:16:32.466
Fuck, you'd lose everything.

01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:37.385
Hold 22.

01:16:40.865 --> 01:16:43.543
If you don't wanna
get out of here

01:16:43.545 --> 01:16:46.145
or if you don't wanna be with
me or if there's anything

01:16:47.465 --> 01:16:50.945
that you're hiding, now's
the time to tell me.

01:16:58.704 --> 01:17:03.504
How would we even do it?

01:17:06.984 --> 01:17:09.184
Meet me in the
chapel tomorrow night.

01:17:32.662 --> 01:17:34.101
Karma's a bitch.

01:17:47.859 --> 01:17:49.458
I've been watchin'
like you asked,

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.620
something's up with
her, I can feel it.

01:17:55.059 --> 01:17:57.058
Good lookin' out, friend.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:57.859
Yeah.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:44.809
Tera.

01:19:52.568 --> 01:19:54.249
Sad about our friend here.

01:19:57.889 --> 01:19:58.688
Heart attack.

01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:08.009
They sayin' it was
some sort of embolism.

01:20:11.528 --> 01:20:14.245
I told you I don't get betrayed.

01:20:14.247 --> 01:20:17.607
Word is you tryin' to
fly away with my duck.

01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:19.647
That true?

01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:22.847
- No.
- Cool.

01:20:24.127 --> 01:20:27.767
So, you still wanna be free?

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.324
What the fuck are you doing?

01:21:01.724 --> 01:21:03.044
World be crazy.

01:21:17.362 --> 01:21:19.682
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:21:22.482 --> 01:21:23.322
I love you.

01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:27.002
Come in, Sharpe.

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.834
Captain, the
ACLU is on the phone.

01:22:22.836 --> 01:22:25.716
They say they're
going to the press.

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:41.513
The ACLU claims
Heartlock inmate

01:22:41.515 --> 01:22:43.072
Kirkland Bosta has been killed.

01:22:43.074 --> 01:22:46.393
Bosta last made headlines on
Tuesday when he filed a lawsuit

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.953
against the facility
alleging police brutality.

01:22:48.955 --> 01:22:51.993
Sources say a guard was present
at the time of Bosta's death

01:22:51.995 --> 01:22:54.073
and that the body was
found in a restricted area.

01:22:54.075 --> 01:22:57.511
The ACLU is demanding
an investigation.

01:22:57.513 --> 01:22:59.232
Some guy with a
badge is outside,

01:22:59.234 --> 01:23:01.792
he says he wants to
photograph your injuries.

01:23:01.794 --> 01:23:03.111
Yeah, please.

01:23:16.273 --> 01:23:19.191
Hi, this is Dennis
Mahogany, attorney at law.

01:23:19.193 --> 01:23:22.710
I've been a longtime friend of
law enforcement, so you know,

01:23:22.712 --> 01:23:26.070
I hear things and well,
give me a call, 518.

01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:42.668
Yo, where's Tera?

01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.789
Beats me, she's in deep shit.

01:24:00.509 --> 01:24:03.789
You were right, getting with
Continental got me twisted.

01:24:05.869 --> 01:24:08.628
Glad you startin' to
see things straight.

01:24:10.788 --> 01:24:14.026
I don't know how to straighten
out without hurting people.

01:24:14.028 --> 01:24:17.505
You killed a man and left
Tera to take the blame,

01:24:17.507 --> 01:24:19.187
I'd say people are already hurt.

01:24:20.507 --> 01:24:23.906
You wanna fix things, god
dammit, start with the truth.

01:24:26.387 --> 01:24:28.904
It's the gruesomeness
of it all, and the fact

01:24:28.906 --> 01:24:31.666
that you were found there
alone covered in his blood.

01:24:34.706 --> 01:24:38.463
Those are the kind of details
the media latches onto,

01:24:38.465 --> 01:24:41.104
putting pressure on
the system to act.

01:24:41.106 --> 01:24:43.824
Now the DA's opening
up an investigation

01:24:43.826 --> 01:24:46.225
and there will inevitably
be a grand jury.

01:24:47.504 --> 01:24:49.464
Your name is likely
to surface soon.

01:24:50.984 --> 01:24:52.464
There's no runnin' from this.

01:24:53.903 --> 01:24:56.101
Your life, your
career, your past,

01:24:56.103 --> 01:24:58.901
it will all be dug
up and scrutinized.

01:24:58.903 --> 01:25:00.142
I don't need that
kind of attention

01:25:00.144 --> 01:25:02.224
anymore than you do, understand?

01:25:04.583 --> 01:25:06.663
I put in the paperwork
for your paid leave.

01:25:15.502 --> 01:25:18.660
If you have any dirty
laundry, it's time to burn it.

01:26:45.335 --> 01:26:46.135
Stop!

01:26:51.693 --> 01:26:52.614
I said stop.

01:26:56.133 --> 01:26:56.933
Wait.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:04.133
No.

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:53.688
Still with us.

01:27:54.529 --> 01:27:55.330
Barely.

01:27:59.728 --> 01:28:00.528
Right.

01:28:03.969 --> 01:28:07.489
Your father should be
proud, he raised a fighter.

01:28:18.367 --> 01:28:19.206
Get outta here.

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:21.326
Hold up.

01:28:22.407 --> 01:28:26.407
Say, this look familiar to you?

01:28:28.326 --> 01:28:29.887
We found it in Lee's pocket.

01:28:35.246 --> 01:28:36.446
Mean anything to you?

01:28:39.045 --> 01:28:39.845
No.

01:31:54.668 --> 01:31:55.548
Mm meow.

01:32:03.968 --> 01:32:08.968
