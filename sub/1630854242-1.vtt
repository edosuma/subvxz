WEBVTT

02:21.275 --> 02:25.646
- Portland's
number one station
for classic rock. 107.1.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.014
The Way Back.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.219
Oh, shit.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.799
This was my mom's jam.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.112
Were you sleeping?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.049
Sorry.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.918
Sorry.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.998
Hey! No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill us both.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.434
Oh!

04:37.878 --> 04:40.147
Yo.
Thanks, babe.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.184
I asked for something
vegetarian,

04:44.352 --> 04:47.355
but she just kind of
threw a bunch of sides
in the box, so...

04:47.421 --> 04:48.856
Hmm.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.492
Better have that thing
memorized by the time
we get to the trailhead.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.927
Do you have it memorized?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.128
You bet your ass I do.

04:55.228 --> 04:59.032
Really? Okay.
What's, uh,
this one right here?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.868
That one? It's so easy.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.270
Uh-huh.
Piccadilly sweet rose.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.074
Not even close. It's...

05:07.174 --> 05:08.709
Look, if I had it
memorized,

05:08.809 --> 05:11.545
I wouldn't have to lug
that thing around, would I?
Mm-hmm.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.084
Hmm, looks like
we have company.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.153
Hey, man.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.290
I could take your trash.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.693
Uh...

05:25.793 --> 05:28.396
Thanks, that's, uh...
Yeah, we just started.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.598
So, maybe you give us,
like, ten minutes?

05:30.698 --> 05:33.801
- Jimmy.
Can I get a hand
in here, please?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.943
Did you see
the red star come down?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.412
Okay, come on.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.755
What the fuck was that?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.520
Here we go.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.159
Ready?

06:33.727 --> 06:34.795
Mm-hmm.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.930
Yeah. It's...

06:37.030 --> 06:39.800
We can totally
chill in the car
if you need more time.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.868
I'm telling you though,

06:40.968 --> 06:42.235
once we get going,

06:42.335 --> 06:43.604
I don't think you're
gonna be nervous
anymore, okay?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.806
This is the fourth time
I've done this trail.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.743
I promise, nothing scary
about it.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.312
Okay?

06:52.480 --> 06:56.316
It's riskier for you
to drive your car to work.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.752
Or surfing. Surfing's
way more dangerous.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.087
You could break your neck,

07:00.187 --> 07:01.822
get eaten by a shark.
You can...

07:01.922 --> 07:03.891
I know that it's different.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.358
I'm comfortable in the ocean.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.494
I've been doing it
my whole life.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.728
I... No, I know,
but you'll be

07:07.828 --> 07:10.731
comfortable backpacking
after this.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.702
Right? Plus, when we're
like 80 years old

07:14.802 --> 07:16.804
and we're looking back
on all these adventures
we had together,

07:16.904 --> 07:19.339
you know, Yellowstone or

07:19.507 --> 07:22.175
Kilimanjaro or Machu Picchu
or something like that,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.645
you're gonna laugh
about how nervous you were.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.517
Yeah. Okay.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.884
Yes!

07:30.984 --> 07:33.153
Thank you. Great. Here we go.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.722
You're not going to
regret this.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.724
You might.

07:36.824 --> 07:37.791
Love you.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.549
- I was, like, 13.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.751
What was her name?

08:03.851 --> 08:04.885
- Belinda.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.854
- Oh, my God.
It was not Belinda.
What?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.288
- No, I swear it was.

08:08.388 --> 08:13.026
Belinda Caldwell.
Yeah, on a trampoline
in her backyard.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.127
- Whoa!
Yeah.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.263
So, who kissed who first?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.198
I'd say it was like
half-and-half, you know?

08:18.298 --> 08:23.637
We talked about it
for 20 minutes and it was all
very scientific, you know?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.573
How was it?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.808
Oh! Not good.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.211
Just not good, you know?
Pressed our mouths together
and kind of

08:31.311 --> 08:32.913
moved them around a bunch.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.281
I do remember thinking,

08:34.381 --> 08:37.084
"Why are there so many
teeth involved in this?"

08:38.752 --> 08:43.190
Like, "Is she gonna try to
bite my fucking tonsils out?"

08:43.290 --> 08:45.225
Like the inside
of my mouth...

08:47.895 --> 08:48.896
Shouldn't have...

08:48.996 --> 08:51.832
Hey, yo! Let's go.
We're burning daylight.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.819
Hey, uh...

09:13.086 --> 09:14.688
How's it coming back there?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.224
It's bad. I mean, it's bad.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.792
Do you wanna
help me, maybe?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.729
Hon, we're trying
to attack this thing
as a team, you know?

09:21.829 --> 09:24.297
I'm doing food,
you're doing lodging.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.735
With our powers combined,
we might make it
through the night.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.170
Just come over here
and try this, all right?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.805
We can deal
with the tent later.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.878
Mm, that's money.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.046
Here.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.448
Just try it.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.850
- Huh. Interesting.

09:42.950 --> 09:47.120
Is this the first of an eight
or nine-course meal or...

09:47.220 --> 09:49.522
Let me explain
a little something about
the human body, okay?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.058
- Hmm.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.894
It works most efficiently
when you give it
just enough fuel, right?

09:53.994 --> 09:57.665
'Cause if you have too much,
then you get sluggish
and you can cramp.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.333
You wanna keep that needle
right above empty. You know?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.470
Oh. Got it. Okay,
so I'll just kinda
eat like this, like...

10:04.705 --> 10:06.173
Yeah, you got it.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.080
What?
What?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.683
You're looking at me like
a weirdo. What is going on?

10:15.783 --> 10:18.819
I'm looking at you
super regular.
Hmm.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.821
How do you want me
to look at you?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.190
Hey, if you wanna kiss me,
just kiss me.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.658
All right.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.526
Love you.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.297
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

10:30.397 --> 10:33.366
It's me, Belinda.
I still love you.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.568
You know what?
Belinda's a good woman.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.038
And while that is exactly
what the kiss was like...

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
...she does not deserve
this ridicule.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.377
And here I think
I'm gonna get some
tooth-free kiss of passion.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.882
Listen, you set up
the tent, we can talk.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.084
Yeah?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.855
Hold this bowl.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.692
One minute. Time me.
For the tent, not the sex.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.961
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be,
like, 30 seconds.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.706
Ruth?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.042
Oh, my God. You scared
the crap out of me.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.077
Sorry, I just...
I woke up in the tent
and you weren't there.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.212
I didn't know where you were.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.681
Yeah, I was peeing
and then I saw something.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.883
Yeah? What?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.185
I think it was a deer.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.923
- Oh, fuck.
I thought you meant,
like, something scary.

12:36.023 --> 12:39.359
It was scary. It was
staring right at me.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.162
I mean, that's kinda what
they do. They just stare on.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.134
Are you done peeing?
Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.019
- Almost there.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.056
Watch your step.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.961
Here we go.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.729
This better be good.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.271
- Yeah,
it's something, isn't it?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.443
Here we go.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.078
Hmm?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.379
Um...

14:07.915 --> 14:09.649
Uh...

14:09.749 --> 14:15.188
You know, six years ago,
I just didn't know
what I wanted in life.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.494
And I swear to God,
I met you, and...

14:23.163 --> 14:25.265
well, it just felt like
all that changed.

14:28.835 --> 14:32.439
'Cause now I feel like
I'm going somewhere, you know?

14:32.539 --> 14:36.643
And I don't even know
where, but I just know
I wanna go there with you.

14:38.845 --> 14:43.616
You're smart
and you're funny.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.252
You're curious and, uh...

14:48.221 --> 14:49.422
I love you.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.194
I love you.

14:57.965 --> 15:03.270
So, um, I just
wanted to ask if, uh...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.281
Will you marry me?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.997
Ruth?

15:35.802 --> 15:36.803
Ruth?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Just stop. Stop.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.054
Harry, I'm... I'm sorry.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.792
Yeah, that's okay.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.796
That's okay.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.773
Harry, you know that it has
nothing to do with you.

16:46.873 --> 16:51.078
It's not about you or, like...
I know, I know.
That's okay. No, I know.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.812
No. You don't
have to say any more.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.722
I just feel like
a fucking idiot.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.670
That's still
a pretty damn good view.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.622
Shit.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.750
Harry.

18:03.850 --> 18:07.154
Look, we don't
have to do this.

18:07.187 --> 18:12.058
I'm sorry, okay?
Just leave it at that.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.630
It's just...

18:19.666 --> 18:21.201
Why did you do it?

18:24.571 --> 18:26.273
You knew.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.808
You knew how I felt about it.
You said that you agreed.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.210
You said marriage
wasn't a big deal.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.345
What do you want me to say?
I wanted to scare you off?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.783
Isn't this good?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.452
I thought this was good.
It is good.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.789
I want to be with you.
You wanna be with me.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.957
That's all that matters.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.895
All that marriage does is
lock you in and you can
lose control of your life.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.063
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.
We're not your parents.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.636
What do my parents
have to do with this?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.307
Are you kidding?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.377
Okay, fine. Um...

19:05.111 --> 19:06.213
I think
your parents splitting

19:06.313 --> 19:08.448
fucked you up more than
you'd like to admit.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.820
Wow. Nice.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.591
I'm not doing this.
You're not my therapist.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.227
Yeah, right.
Like you tell her anything.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.694
Excuse me?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.763
You tell her what
she wants to hear,
so you get your medicine.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.632
Are you kidding me?
You've admitted that.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.501
Look, maybe if you were
honest with her or you,
I don't know, fucking tried,

19:28.601 --> 19:30.303
then you wouldn't be
so stressed out
around this shit.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.938
Around what shit?

19:32.038 --> 19:34.607
Oh, my God. Ruth,
I just proposed to you
and you had a panic attack.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.444
You're stressed out
about commitment.
You're stressed out by travel.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.678
That is not how it works.
You're...

19:38.778 --> 19:41.548
I'm not stressed out.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.815
You don't know what
you're talking about,

19:42.915 --> 19:45.151
so just shut the fuck up!

19:54.561 --> 19:55.662
Harry, I'm...

22:08.761 --> 22:10.763
Dr. Ledlow's office.
How can I help you?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.501
Hello?

22:16.536 --> 22:17.504
Hello?

22:30.583 --> 22:31.818
What the...

23:00.947 --> 23:02.449
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

23:02.482 --> 23:06.218
It's just me. Whoa. Hey. Hey,
it's okay. It's just me.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.855
What's going on?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.490
Why did you leave...

23:10.590 --> 23:12.692
Oh. Holy shit.

23:12.792 --> 23:17.129
I was just walking
and I found it like that.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.100
My God.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.669
What could've done that?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.641
I don't know. Jesus Christ.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.584
- What's
all that stuff on it?

23:37.684 --> 23:39.886
- Looks like
some kind of fungus, maybe?

23:41.387 --> 23:43.490
Is that the deer
from the other night?

23:44.323 --> 23:47.159
No. No, no way.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.328
Do you know how many deer
are in these woods?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.701
Jesus, you're shivering.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.703
Hey. Hey,
hey, hey.

23:58.638 --> 23:59.739
It's okay.
We'll go back
to camp

23:59.839 --> 24:01.941
and I'll just
make you some lunch.
We'll relax.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.576
- Yeah.
All right.

24:04.711 --> 24:05.878
Jesus.

24:32.071 --> 24:37.343
Here we go. "Deer warts
or cutaneous fibromas are
caused by a papillomavirus.

24:37.443 --> 24:38.878
"They are usually temporary

24:38.978 --> 24:42.715
"and can vary
from half an inch
to several inches across."

24:48.621 --> 24:50.456
I guess that could be it.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.628
But whatever killed it
is still out there.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.463
Yeah, but it's not
gonna bother us.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.066
We're too loud, we wield fire.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.001
It's not gonna come
anywhere close.

25:06.773 --> 25:07.907
Look...

25:08.908 --> 25:11.778
I don't know
what we are right now.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.581
But I swear, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.749
Okay?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.688
Sorry.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.595
Harry, you're allowed
to touch me.

25:30.162 --> 25:34.934
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
Just for everything, you know?

25:36.468 --> 25:39.706
Honestly, I never even
thought about what
would happen if you said no.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.642
Just how awful
that would be for you

25:42.742 --> 25:44.010
to have to walk around
in the woods with me and...

25:44.110 --> 25:46.613
Harry, I'd walk around
in the woods with you any day.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.983
I love you.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.622
Yeah?
Yeah, of course I do,
you idiot.

25:56.856 --> 25:57.957
But...

25:59.058 --> 26:00.760
People change,

26:01.794 --> 26:04.030
and someday
you're gonna change

26:04.130 --> 26:09.068
and maybe that new version
of you will love me,
and maybe it won't.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.205
But you shouldn't
force anything.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.943
What we have is good.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.411
It's really good.

26:19.511 --> 26:22.114
That's why I don't want
to get married. I don't
want to mess it up.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.652
I've seen what can happen,
you know that.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.290
I'm with you
because I love you.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.061
Isn't that enough?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.569
Yeah.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.673
Yeah, it is.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.855
I was thinking
of maybe just going
for a little stroll.

27:35.955 --> 27:36.989
Yeah? You want me
to come with you?

27:37.089 --> 27:40.192
No, you, uh,
keep cooking.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.962
You sure?
I can finish this up.
I'll come with you.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.097
I'm going to
the bathroom, okay?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.365
Oh.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.502
- You're
a disgusting monster.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.387
No way.

28:26.405 --> 28:27.974
Piccadilly sweet rose.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.260
Whoa.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.156
What the hell?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.999
- Ruth!

30:35.634 --> 30:36.735
Ruth!

30:37.836 --> 30:38.804
Ruth!

30:38.905 --> 30:40.139
Jesus Christ.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.107
Hey!

30:49.615 --> 30:52.618
Ruth. Hey. Hey.

30:52.718 --> 30:53.752
Hi.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.688
Hi?

30:56.788 --> 30:58.157
You've been gone
for like half an hour.

30:58.257 --> 31:02.328
I know. I was distracted.
Thinking about stuff.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.164
Okay.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.733
I mean, you know, that's cool
and everything. I just...

31:07.833 --> 31:09.435
You gotta consider
the context.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.503
You did, like,
disappear into the woods
yesterday, so...

31:11.603 --> 31:14.806
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.843
It's okay.
I'm not trying to...

31:18.744 --> 31:20.246
It's okay.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.182
Are you all right?

31:23.682 --> 31:24.750
Mm-hmm.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.323
Okay. Cool.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.460
Let's head back, huh?
Before the birds
eat our breakfast.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.662
Come on.

33:25.971 --> 33:26.938
Ruth?

33:34.480 --> 33:35.747
Ruth?

33:42.621 --> 33:43.655
Ruth?

33:51.730 --> 33:52.931
Ruth?

34:09.915 --> 34:10.916
Ruth?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.287
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

34:16.988 --> 34:19.358
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack? What are you
doing out here?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.262
Is that my knife?

34:26.698 --> 34:28.234
I thought I heard an animal.

34:29.968 --> 34:33.038
I mean, that thing's
not gonna do much.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.370
- Good night.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.194
You get some sleep?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.197
- Mm-hmm.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.064
You know, Stevenson
said he's gonna retire
at the end of the year.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.734
So, I finish
my master's in time,

36:08.834 --> 36:11.370
then I'll be
on the short list
for vice-principal.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.448
You know, there'll be
other candidates, too, so...

36:23.249 --> 36:25.351
Don't get too excited.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.958
Should not be
a problem for you.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.068
I'm sorry.
What's that?

36:45.737 --> 36:48.006
I'm sorry that I was
being weird last night.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.009
It's just...

36:52.844 --> 36:55.146
I haven't been
feeling like myself.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.419
That's okay.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.931
You don't
have to apologize.

37:13.832 --> 37:18.003
I know the trip
got a little weird.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.007
Not what I intended,
obviously.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.414
I've actually
been thinking about that.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.385
I know this is probably
gonna come out of nowhere.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.424
But I think I was wrong.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.362
About?

37:44.129 --> 37:45.597
About us getting married.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.339
Are you serious?

37:54.673 --> 37:55.941
Yeah.

37:56.942 --> 38:01.780
It's just... You were right.
We're not my parents.

38:01.880 --> 38:06.918
Whatever their problems were,
that's their story.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.021
But we should have
a chance at our own.

38:11.890 --> 38:15.694
So, I don't know,
I think...

38:18.564 --> 38:20.165
I think we should do this.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.139
Are you sure?

38:29.675 --> 38:31.410
'Cause I just don't
want to do it if
you're not totally...

38:31.510 --> 38:32.678
Yes, I'm sure.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.382
But there's one condition.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.683
Okay. Yeah.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.521
I want you to ask me again.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.394
But I want us to pretend
like it's the first time.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.733
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.404
Um...

39:00.038 --> 39:01.573
Uh, yeah.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.042
No. Not here.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.612
What do you mean?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.431
- It's so beautiful.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.567
- Yep.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.736
Here we are again.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.975
Glad I didn't toss this.

39:43.081 --> 39:44.450
You ready?

39:47.919 --> 39:49.621
We're really doing this, huh?

40:03.134 --> 40:07.405
Ruth Miller,
will you spend the rest
of your life with me?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.678
Yes, I will.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.326
Damn, that looks good on you.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.471
That is the most
incredible thing
I have ever felt.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.814
I love you, Harry.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.218
- I love you.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.155
- No. No, no! No.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.227
- Oh, my God.

43:18.229 --> 43:19.665
Oh, my God.

43:24.069 --> 43:25.136
Oh.

43:26.872 --> 43:28.106
Viv?

43:28.840 --> 43:29.941
Vivian!

43:33.879 --> 43:35.146
Oh, my God.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.686
Are you okay?

43:41.687 --> 43:43.689
She's dehydrated.

43:47.258 --> 43:50.261
It's okay.
Just take a sip.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.164
Mm?

44:02.473 --> 44:06.277
Now, what happened to you?

44:09.380 --> 44:10.882
I don't remember.

44:13.551 --> 44:14.886
I'll call 911.

44:20.225 --> 44:22.227
Shit. No service.

44:25.163 --> 44:28.633
- You know what?
We're about to set up camp.

44:28.734 --> 44:31.136
Why don't you
come with us, huh?

44:32.203 --> 44:34.439
We'll get
some food in you.
Would you like that?

44:38.977 --> 44:40.078
Ray?

44:41.212 --> 44:42.313
Yeah.

44:57.763 --> 44:58.864
Still nothing.

44:58.964 --> 45:01.066
I know. Quiet as a mouse.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.269
I'm gonna give it
another shot.

45:10.508 --> 45:12.077
Hey there, hon.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.417
You feeling better?

45:23.789 --> 45:26.491
We're gonna head back
first thing in the morning,
I promise.

45:26.591 --> 45:32.430
But you, um, ready to tell us
what happened to you?

45:34.599 --> 45:36.334
I said I don't remember.

45:39.137 --> 45:42.507
Maybe you have
a campsite close by?

45:45.977 --> 45:47.278
What about your gear?

45:47.378 --> 45:51.382
You didn't have anything
with you. I mean,
were you alone?

45:54.652 --> 45:57.956
You didn't come
all the way out here
by yourself, did you?

46:04.062 --> 46:07.833
You know what?
Forget about it then.

46:07.866 --> 46:09.667
You'll remember
when you remember.

46:11.369 --> 46:13.704
Let's talk about
something else, huh?

46:14.405 --> 46:15.573
Um...

46:15.673 --> 46:20.245
What do you like
to do, Ruth?
You got any hobbies?

46:22.680 --> 46:24.049
I...

46:27.919 --> 46:29.855
...like to surf.

46:29.888 --> 46:32.457
Oh! That's great. Us, too.

46:33.391 --> 46:36.761
You know, we used to
lug our shortboards

46:36.862 --> 46:37.863
out to the beach here,

46:37.929 --> 46:40.065
but the last few times
we did,

46:40.165 --> 46:43.101
there were
way too many sharks.

46:43.201 --> 46:46.972
Global warming
pushes them all
inland. So...

46:55.780 --> 46:58.716
Honey, are you all right?

47:09.194 --> 47:13.664
You know, I'm gonna go
walk out a little further,

47:13.764 --> 47:18.603
and see if I can find
some service.
Get a call out.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.917
I think something's
really wrong with her.

47:32.017 --> 47:34.419
Honey, I don't think
we can wait until morning.

47:34.519 --> 47:35.553
Okay.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.158
Sweetheart...

47:43.361 --> 47:45.263
What are you doing
with that?

48:06.384 --> 48:08.486
Come on, kid.
Put that thing down.

48:11.022 --> 48:12.257
No.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.326
- Hey. There you are.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.795
- Who is that guy?

48:19.130 --> 48:20.165
Oh!

48:20.265 --> 48:21.466
It's him.

48:24.669 --> 48:25.703
Hey, Ruth.

48:26.571 --> 48:27.638
What the fuck?

48:28.139 --> 48:29.975
No. No.

48:30.675 --> 48:31.977
No.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.844
- Hey.
That's close enough.

48:35.113 --> 48:36.347
Who are your friends?

48:36.447 --> 48:37.582
No, no.
We're right here, honey.

48:37.682 --> 48:38.984
No, we have to run.
No, it's okay.

48:39.050 --> 48:40.485
Where are you going?

48:41.586 --> 48:43.054
Come back!

48:43.154 --> 48:46.591
Last time I'm gonna
tell you, buddy. Just stay
the fuck where you are!

48:46.691 --> 48:48.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're being
a little aggressive, dude.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.494
All right.
You had your warning.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.862
Hey. Relax, man.
I come in peace.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.551
Hey. Thanks for finding her.

49:16.887 --> 49:17.888
Ruth?

49:19.757 --> 49:20.758
Oh, God.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.365
What are you doing?

49:27.465 --> 49:28.899
We have to hide.
Okay.

49:34.039 --> 49:35.106
Who is that guy?

49:35.206 --> 49:36.841
Is he your boyfriend?

49:39.110 --> 49:41.879
That is not Harry.

49:47.352 --> 49:50.455
- Hello! Viv!

49:50.555 --> 49:52.457
No, no, no. Please.
Please, no. Stay.

49:52.557 --> 49:55.626
Sweetheart, it's okay.
It's just Ray.
It's my husband.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.263
Over here.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.035
- Thank God.

50:05.236 --> 50:06.671
Are you okay?

50:06.771 --> 50:07.905
I'm okay.

50:09.374 --> 50:10.608
- Well...

50:12.510 --> 50:14.379
Well, what about that guy?

50:16.114 --> 50:17.082
Well, where's he?

50:23.154 --> 50:25.156
Right behind me.

50:45.943 --> 50:47.078
Come on out, Ruth.

50:51.249 --> 50:52.883
I'm gonna kill her
if you don't.

51:05.596 --> 51:08.166
Hey. There's our girl.

51:11.802 --> 51:13.204
What did you do to her?

51:14.339 --> 51:16.006
Her?

51:16.141 --> 51:21.146
Oh, don't worry.
I can fix that. Watch.

51:27.152 --> 51:28.919
No!

51:31.722 --> 51:32.957
How did you know?

51:36.527 --> 51:38.663
How?
I don't wanna die.

51:38.763 --> 51:41.031
I saw where you took him.

51:44.169 --> 51:45.836
I found the cave.

51:54.011 --> 51:55.180
What the hell?

52:09.294 --> 52:10.695
Oh, my God.

52:12.330 --> 52:13.498
Harry.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.322
Oh, God. Oh, God.

53:00.278 --> 53:01.346
- Ruth!

53:02.513 --> 53:03.814
Ruth!

53:04.515 --> 53:05.950
Ruth! Jesus Christ.

53:07.252 --> 53:08.319
Hey!

53:09.587 --> 53:10.821
- I saw him.

53:11.556 --> 53:13.891
Fuck. The cave.

53:14.925 --> 53:16.494
I knew it was too close.

53:22.667 --> 53:24.935
What are you?

53:25.035 --> 53:27.538
I'm pissed off
is what I am, Ruth.

53:33.578 --> 53:35.313
I'm a scout.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.748
I get to the planet first,
then I report back
to the others.

53:37.848 --> 53:39.650
What am I fucking doing?

53:39.750 --> 53:41.118
What am I doing
telling you this?

53:44.489 --> 53:45.490
Goodbye, Ruth.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.992
No, no, no. No. Please.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.093
Please.

53:50.328 --> 53:54.164
What am I doing?
Just do it. Just do it.

53:59.136 --> 54:00.204
Goodbye, Ruth.

54:00.305 --> 54:04.642
No, no. No. I don't...
Please. Please.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.311
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

54:06.377 --> 54:09.847
All the creatures
I could stumble upon,
I gotta be this guy.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.949
Okay.

54:12.049 --> 54:18.155
I was better off
as the deer. Just do it!
Just do it.

54:18.323 --> 54:20.858
No, please. I won't
tell anyone. I promise.

54:20.958 --> 54:23.761
I promise I won't tell.
I won't.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.946
No. Wait, what...

54:43.614 --> 54:44.949
Do I love you?

54:46.551 --> 54:48.419
Like, do I love you?
Is that...

54:51.021 --> 54:52.590
Is that even possible?

54:57.362 --> 54:58.463
How the...

55:04.869 --> 55:06.371
I love your hands.

55:08.373 --> 55:09.374
What the...

55:11.075 --> 55:12.443
I love your smile.

55:13.978 --> 55:15.380
I love your laugh.

55:17.515 --> 55:18.683
Fuck!

55:20.551 --> 55:21.652
I love you.

55:23.187 --> 55:24.755
I love you, Ruth.

55:25.390 --> 55:26.090
No! Wait!

55:33.063 --> 55:35.700
Ruth! You don't
have to worry.

55:37.134 --> 55:38.569
I'm not gonna hurt you.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.271
I love you!

55:43.874 --> 55:45.676
Oh, it feels incredible!

55:54.419 --> 55:56.421
Ruth, let me explain.

55:56.521 --> 55:58.556
Okay.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.625
I see that you're angry.

56:02.893 --> 56:04.228
Get away from me.

56:04.328 --> 56:05.496
Hey. Why don't we
just calm down
and talk about this?

56:09.834 --> 56:10.968
This is so us.

56:11.068 --> 56:13.771
Look, I understand why
you're angry. I killed Harry.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.874
But, silver lining,
I am Harry.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.443
No, you're not.

56:18.476 --> 56:20.478
No. I literally am.
I'm an exact biological
replication of him.

56:20.578 --> 56:23.113
All of his thoughts,
his fears, his memories
are my thoughts,

56:23.213 --> 56:24.482
my fears, my memories.

56:24.582 --> 56:26.183
Our first date was
at the Sherwood Fair.

56:26.283 --> 56:27.785
I kissed you
on the Thunder Bolt.
What? Stop. Stop!

56:27.885 --> 56:29.687
Hey, Ruth. Hear me out.

56:30.755 --> 56:31.922
I've been
so many different things.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.758
I thought I felt everything
there was to feel, right?

56:33.858 --> 56:36.594
It turns out, I realized now,
I wasn't actually feeling
those things.

56:36.694 --> 56:38.763
It was just whatever I was
that was feeling them.

56:38.863 --> 56:41.866
But for some reason,
as soon as I felt love,
all of a sudden

56:41.966 --> 56:43.934
I was feeling those feelings.

56:44.034 --> 56:46.904
And not just feeling
the feeling of something else
feeling those feelings.

56:47.004 --> 56:48.305
Do you know what I mean?

56:51.308 --> 56:53.711
What do you want from me?

56:56.113 --> 56:57.347
I...

57:05.055 --> 57:06.524
I wanna
show you something.

57:34.652 --> 57:35.686
You know,
the craziest thing is,

57:35.786 --> 57:38.556
love doesn't even exist
anywhere else.

57:38.656 --> 57:41.258
It's a singularly
human emotion.

57:41.358 --> 57:44.194
Like, of all
the different things
that I've been,

57:44.294 --> 57:46.597
none of 'em feel it.
Isn't that nuts?

57:49.534 --> 57:51.401
Just tell me
where we're going.

57:52.737 --> 57:54.905
What part of
"it's a surprise"
don't you get?

57:58.876 --> 57:59.944
All right, you know what?

58:01.278 --> 58:02.547
You've been patient.

58:03.347 --> 58:04.615
You ready?

58:05.950 --> 58:07.051
For what?

58:16.260 --> 58:17.928
It's a pretty
sweet ride, right?

58:20.297 --> 58:22.567
Oh, my God.

58:30.307 --> 58:31.576
All right.

58:32.577 --> 58:35.946
Look, I know you love Earth.

58:36.046 --> 58:40.184
I just think a change
of scenery could be
really good for you.

58:40.284 --> 58:42.286
You know, just mentally.

58:42.386 --> 58:43.788
Obviously, here you've got
a lot of triggers,

58:43.888 --> 58:46.857
a lot of stressors,
but if we go someplace else,

58:46.957 --> 58:48.192
some quiet little planet,

58:48.292 --> 58:52.129
somewhere no one
will ever find us,
we got a fresh start.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.635
Bigger thing is,

58:59.236 --> 59:00.705
I really care about you,

59:01.639 --> 59:03.874
and I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

59:05.610 --> 59:07.778
There are a lot more
like me coming.

59:08.813 --> 59:11.415
They are gonna blend in
and take over,

59:11.515 --> 59:15.052
and they are gonna turn
this planet into a place
that you don't wanna be.

59:16.286 --> 59:17.521
Trust me.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.794
I can give you
an incredible life, Ruth.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.031
I really can.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.636
What do you say?

59:36.340 --> 59:37.642
Okay.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.646
Yeah?

59:41.679 --> 59:43.648
Yeah, you're serious?
Yeah.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.556
All right. All right.

59:52.657 --> 59:54.124
That's what
I'm talking about.

59:54.224 --> 59:56.393
You're gonna flip
when you see the inside
of this thing.

59:56.493 --> 59:59.664
I mean, it looks tight,
but once you're inside,
it's like a mansion.

59:59.764 --> 1:00:01.131
It's kind of hard...

1:00:02.499 --> 1:00:05.202
Oh, come on. Are we
really gonna do this again?

1:00:05.302 --> 1:00:06.871
Just get in the ship, Ruth.

1:00:09.473 --> 1:00:10.708
Oh, God.

1:00:13.243 --> 1:00:14.712
You've gotta
be kidding me.

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:22.252
Ruth!

1:00:23.888 --> 1:00:24.889
Ruth!

1:00:29.827 --> 1:00:30.828
Ruth!

1:00:44.909 --> 1:00:45.910
Ruth!

1:00:48.746 --> 1:00:50.314
You're gonna drown.

1:00:52.950 --> 1:00:55.686
Come on!
You're being ridiculous.

1:01:00.557 --> 1:01:02.860
Ruth, please!

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.763
Ruth,
what is the endgame
here? Seriously.

1:01:07.097 --> 1:01:08.866
Oh, do not look
at me like that.

1:01:08.966 --> 1:01:12.136
I'm just trying to help.
Let's just head back
and talk...

1:03:40.384 --> 1:03:41.986
Oh, my God.

1:04:51.788 --> 1:04:53.323
Oh, no.

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:47.544
I don't understand, Ruth.

1:05:49.013 --> 1:05:50.547
Why do you keep running?

1:05:54.251 --> 1:05:55.885
I'm trying to save you.

1:05:58.088 --> 1:05:59.789
Don't you wanna be saved?

1:07:09.559 --> 1:07:11.728
You know, it didn't
have to be this way.

1:07:13.630 --> 1:07:15.832
I just wanted us to love
each other, Ruth.

1:07:17.634 --> 1:07:19.203
I was never gonna
hurt you.

1:07:21.571 --> 1:07:24.808
It could have been
so easy.

1:07:34.318 --> 1:07:35.885
But you didn't want that.

1:07:37.387 --> 1:07:38.955
So I found another way.

1:07:45.129 --> 1:07:46.830
An even purer form of love.

1:07:52.502 --> 1:07:54.138
What do you think
love is, Ruth?

1:07:57.141 --> 1:07:58.242
It's desire.

1:07:59.309 --> 1:08:02.045
Sure, but for what?

1:08:02.146 --> 1:08:05.215
It can't be as simple as
wanting to spend time
with someone...

1:08:06.483 --> 1:08:08.185
Or have sex with them,

1:08:09.018 --> 1:08:11.155
or share
your darkest secrets...

1:08:13.657 --> 1:08:15.892
Because you and Harry
did all those things,

1:08:17.026 --> 1:08:19.663
and never once
did his love weaken.

1:08:25.202 --> 1:08:26.603
But shouldn't it?

1:08:28.238 --> 1:08:30.407
Hunger passes when we eat.

1:08:30.507 --> 1:08:33.277
Exhaustion fades
when we sleep.

1:08:34.478 --> 1:08:36.246
But that's not true
for love.

1:08:38.014 --> 1:08:40.784
That's what
makes it so unique.

1:08:41.785 --> 1:08:43.687
The goal is unattainable.

1:08:45.389 --> 1:08:50.294
It's two souls
desperately wanting
to become one.

1:08:51.895 --> 1:08:56.266
And that is a desire
human beings
could never fulfill.

1:09:11.581 --> 1:09:12.916
But I can.

1:09:36.005 --> 1:09:39.276
I've been longing
to see inside of you.

1:09:40.910 --> 1:09:45.415
All the colors,
the electricity, the passion.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:50.053
The love.

1:09:53.623 --> 1:09:54.991
You do love him.

1:10:01.431 --> 1:10:03.267
But so much pain.

1:10:08.372 --> 1:10:10.374
It makes so much sense now.

1:10:13.843 --> 1:10:16.246
I feel like I finally
understand you.

1:10:21.551 --> 1:10:23.052
Don't worry.

1:10:25.822 --> 1:10:28.458
I won't let your pain
hold you back any longer.

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:33.963
I'm gonna live the life
you always should have.

1:10:36.733 --> 1:10:38.968
I'm gonna make something
out of you.

1:10:41.771 --> 1:10:43.139
Goodbye, Ruth.

1:10:44.341 --> 1:10:48.177
No. That's not possible.

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:52.048
What's that?

1:10:52.148 --> 1:10:55.118
You said you won't let my pain
hold you back.

1:10:57.186 --> 1:11:02.526
But that's not possible
because you can't control it.

1:11:03.993 --> 1:11:06.663
The pain is a part of you.

1:11:06.763 --> 1:11:11.134
You can't separate it
from who you are.

1:11:11.234 --> 1:11:16.906
If you try and ignore it,
it'll just squeeze you
even harder.

1:11:18.007 --> 1:11:20.544
You'll think
about your future,

1:11:20.644 --> 1:11:23.513
but all you'll see
is your past.

1:11:23.613 --> 1:11:28.618
You'll hear them screaming,
glass breaking,

1:11:28.718 --> 1:11:31.855
everything falling apart
around you.

1:11:31.955 --> 1:11:35.992
And you'll remember
that's where it all leads.

1:11:37.193 --> 1:11:39.863
Mom never leaving
the house again.

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:42.065
Dad drinking himself to death.

1:11:42.699 --> 1:11:44.233
Which one are you gonna be?

1:11:44.368 --> 1:11:45.769
Huh? Huh?

1:11:45.869 --> 1:11:47.537
Stop.

1:11:47.637 --> 1:11:49.506
Can't breathe, can you?

1:11:49.606 --> 1:11:52.576
Feel like you're gonna die?
Please stop. Stop!

1:11:52.676 --> 1:11:54.243
Why?

1:11:54.378 --> 1:11:57.180
I thought you loved
being human.

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:59.716
You wanna feel everything
that we feel.

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:03.653
Don't you? Don't you?

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:26.776
There's none left.
Nothing's gonna save you.

1:12:30.046 --> 1:12:32.416
You will always be broken.

1:12:33.483 --> 1:12:34.718
You're worthless.

1:12:35.919 --> 1:12:37.587
You'll never be happy.

1:12:38.422 --> 1:12:40.089
What's the fucking point
of you?

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:43.092
Stop, please. Please.
I can't breathe.

1:12:43.192 --> 1:12:45.429
I can't. Please just stop.

1:12:45.462 --> 1:12:47.330
Please. Please.

1:13:06.750 --> 1:13:07.851
Please.

1:13:10.587 --> 1:13:12.922
It's... It's okay.

1:13:14.257 --> 1:13:17.594
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1:13:18.662 --> 1:13:20.163
It helps to lie down.

1:13:31.908 --> 1:13:33.209
There you go.

1:13:41.017 --> 1:13:42.318
Just breathe.

1:13:47.957 --> 1:13:49.258
There you go.

1:17:09.859 --> 1:17:15.464
Jesus, Ruth. I knew
you had issues, but wow.

1:17:17.333 --> 1:17:20.904
I didn't know you could be
so violent.

1:17:22.005 --> 1:17:25.541
Do you really think
that you can run?

1:17:25.709 --> 1:17:28.577
I know every last thing
about you.

1:17:28.712 --> 1:17:30.780
You can't hide from me.

1:17:31.547 --> 1:17:33.449
Or from what's coming.
