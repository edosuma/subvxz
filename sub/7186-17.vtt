00:13.080 --> 00:14.313

00:31.665 --> 00:34.633

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:34.635 --> 00:36.368

00:56.490 --> 00:57.756
<i>¶ And join the crew </i>

00:58.792 --> 01:00.559
Yo-ho, let's go!

01:00.561 --> 01:02.227
Ha-har!

01:03.296 --> 01:04.797
Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.799 --> 01:07.633
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:09.135 --> 01:10.169
Great!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.637
To start today's adventure,

01:11.639 --> 01:14.373
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.275
Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.277 --> 01:18.277
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:18.279 --> 01:19.611
One more time.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.680
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:24.851 --> 01:28.454
[Jake] A Bad Case of Barnacles!

01:28.456 --> 01:32.224
[Jake] Yo-ho, Bucky!
Set sail for open waters!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.159
We've got exploring to do!

01:34.161 --> 01:36.161
[clanging]

01:36.163 --> 01:37.796
Hang on, mateys.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.432
I got a feeling Bucky's
really going to move!

01:40.434 --> 01:45.204
- [bell clanging]
- [all] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:45.206 --> 01:47.539
It's almost as if someone

01:47.541 --> 01:50.509
or something was tickling him.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.178
What's going on Bucky?
You OK?

01:53.180 --> 01:55.647
- [all] Whoa!
- Oh, no!

01:55.649 --> 01:59.751
[Jake] Looks like
Bucky has a bad case
of Buccaneer Barnacles!

01:59.753 --> 02:01.854
Buccaneer whaty-whats?

02:01.856 --> 02:05.657
Little sea creatures
that stick to the bottom

02:05.659 --> 02:10.195
of pirate ships
and tickle 'em. A lot!

02:10.197 --> 02:11.763
[clanging]

02:11.765 --> 02:14.233
We've got to get
those things off our pal

02:14.235 --> 02:18.137
or he won't be able
to sail us anywhere! But how?

02:18.139 --> 02:20.172
I know.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.176
Check out my Big Book
of Never Land Flowers!

02:24.178 --> 02:26.311
Ah-ha! Here it is.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.681
"The Zebra Rose is
a very rare flower

02:29.683 --> 02:32.518
with black and white
stripes like a zebra.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.855
Its strong aroma chases off
Buccaneer Barnacles."

02:36.857 --> 02:39.224
It says here that
the Zebra Rose is

02:39.226 --> 02:42.828
only found on Crimson Isle!
That's Red Jessica's island!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.863
Then that's where we're going.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.233
Mateys, will you help us
find the Zebra Rose

02:48.235 --> 02:51.370
and make Bucky's bad case
of barnacles go away?

02:52.805 --> 02:54.173
Great!

02:54.175 --> 02:56.675
Keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.179
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.248
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.184
Is everybody ready?

03:05.186 --> 03:08.220
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.422
And I've got my pixie dust.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.825
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.694
But only in emergencies.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.331
Yo-ho, let's go
find the Zebra Rose!

03:21.968 --> 03:25.270
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:25.272 --> 03:27.606
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:27.608 --> 03:28.974
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:28.976 --> 03:32.311
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:32.313 --> 03:35.447
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:35.449 --> 03:37.516
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:39.586 --> 03:41.353
[all] Ahoy, Red Jessica!

03:41.355 --> 03:42.921
Ahoy, mateys!

03:42.923 --> 03:45.257
What brings ye
all the way to
Crimson Isle?

03:45.259 --> 03:47.226
It's our ship, Bucky.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.995
He's got a bad case
of Buccaneer Barnacles.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.765
I guess that means you've
come to find the Zebra Rose.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.535
That's right! Do you know
where we can find it?

03:56.537 --> 03:59.338
Aye, that I do!

03:59.340 --> 04:03.008
Smee, I cannot wait to
give this fair flower

04:03.010 --> 04:06.979
to the fairest pirate
maiden in Never... [gasps]

04:06.981 --> 04:10.816
Jake and his puny pirates?
What are they doing here?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.986
Oh, cap'n, I'm sure they
were just passing by and...

04:13.988 --> 04:15.420
Quick, hide!

04:15.422 --> 04:18.924
Now, little mateys,
follow this map closely

04:18.926 --> 04:20.993
and with a
little pokin' around,

04:20.995 --> 04:23.996
you'll find the
Zebra Rose for sure!

04:23.998 --> 04:25.964
- Gee, thanks!
- Bye-bye!

04:25.966 --> 04:27.599
<i>Arrivederci!</i>

04:27.601 --> 04:29.434
Did you hear that, Smee?

04:29.436 --> 04:34.940
Red Jessica sent the
popinjays on a quest
for a precious Zebra Rose.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.775
How delightful.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.977
[sighs] What am I doing?

04:38.979 --> 04:43.282
She won't want this
boring old red rose!

04:43.284 --> 04:46.752
I must get that Zebra Rose
and bring it to her first!

04:46.754 --> 04:50.622
We'll follow the
popinjays to the flower
she truly desires...

04:50.624 --> 04:52.724
...and take it!

04:52.726 --> 04:55.427
Oh dear, dear me...

04:57.730 --> 04:59.331
This way, mateys!

04:59.333 --> 05:03.302
The map says the
Zebra Rose is in Rose Valley,

05:03.304 --> 05:06.838
just over this... hill.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.474
[Jake] The whole valley
is full of roses!

05:09.476 --> 05:12.577
[Izzy] In every color
under the Never Land sun!

05:12.579 --> 05:15.047
Finding the Zebra Rose
down there will be like

05:15.049 --> 05:17.949
finding a cracker
in a haystack!

05:17.951 --> 05:20.485
I don't know, Skully.
It shouldn't be that hard

05:20.487 --> 05:23.689
to find a Zebra Rose in a
field of colorful flowers!

05:23.691 --> 05:25.857
Ah, coconuts!

05:25.859 --> 05:28.026
These rose bushes have thorns!

05:28.028 --> 05:31.963
If we try to walk through
those bushes, we'll get poked!

05:31.965 --> 05:34.800
But Bucky needs that Zebra Rose.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.035
This sounds like an emergency.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.504
Pixie dust away!

05:41.007 --> 05:46.111
C'mon, mateys!
Keep a lookout for
a striped Zebra Rose!

05:46.113 --> 05:49.081
Me genius plan
is working, Smee.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.818
Jake and his crew
will do all the work.

05:52.820 --> 05:58.390
Once they find the Zebra Rose,
I'll swoop in and take it!

05:58.991 --> 06:01.927
Yo-ho, mateys! I found it!

06:01.929 --> 06:04.763
Whoa! But I'm
not the only one!

06:04.765 --> 06:07.933
- [Izzy] Zebra Bees!
- [Cubby] Zebra Bees?

06:07.935 --> 06:11.370
Now how're we going to get
the Zebra Rose to help Bucky?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.739
Too bad there's no
Lion Flies around.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.876
Zebra Bees are afraid of them
because they roar like lions.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.847
That's it, Izz!
Let's roar like Lion Flies!

06:21.849 --> 06:24.449
[all roaring]

06:27.687 --> 06:29.054
[laughing]

06:29.056 --> 06:32.724
It worked! We chased
the Zebra Bees away!

06:32.726 --> 06:35.160
Now we can pick the Zebra Rose!

06:35.162 --> 06:37.829
And we got three
gold doubloons!

06:37.831 --> 06:40.098
Let's grab 'em
and go help Bucky!

06:41.033 --> 06:44.169
I'll take that! [laughs]

06:44.171 --> 06:48.407
Hey! Captain Hook!
We need that Zebra Rose!

06:48.409 --> 06:50.075
Puny pirates,

06:50.077 --> 06:55.013
I shall be the one
to deliver this
exotic specimen!

06:55.015 --> 06:57.849
"Deliver?" I'm confused!

06:57.851 --> 07:00.585
Who's Hook going
deliver the rose to?

07:00.587 --> 07:03.455
I don't know,
but we need to get it back.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.090
Bucky's counting on us!

07:05.092 --> 07:07.092
Look!

07:07.094 --> 07:09.961
We can see which rose
Hook and Smee are on.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.998
It bends down a little
when they hop on top of it.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.735
Hey... if we bend it all
the way down to the ground,

07:16.737 --> 07:19.805
maybe we could reach
the Zebra Rose!

07:19.807 --> 07:21.973
Great pirate plan, Cubby!

07:21.975 --> 07:25.076
Mateys, they're on that rose!

07:25.078 --> 07:28.146
Yo-ho, everyone jump!

07:30.082 --> 07:31.950
Smee, what's happening?

07:31.952 --> 07:36.688
Oh, dear. Perhaps I've had
too much pirate pudding, cap'n?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.623
- [chuckles]
- I'll take that back now!

07:38.625 --> 07:41.193
Got it! You can let go, mateys!

07:42.128 --> 07:46.731
[both screaming]

07:46.733 --> 07:53.171
We got the Zebra Rose
back, and we got three
more gold doubloons!

07:53.173 --> 07:57.075
Let's grab 'em and go
help good ship Bucky!

07:57.077 --> 08:00.979
[Hook laughs]
Thank you, puny pirate!

08:00.981 --> 08:05.550
The whirly-hook!
I never leave me
ship without it!

08:05.552 --> 08:09.154
Captain Hook, come back!
We need that rose to...

08:09.156 --> 08:11.756
I'm not listening!

08:11.758 --> 08:15.126
My pirate-gal
desires this rose

08:15.128 --> 08:19.998
and it shall be I
who delivers it to her!

08:20.000 --> 08:24.769
He's taking the rose
to Red Jessica!
After them, mateys!

08:26.005 --> 08:27.739
- Cap'n! Hold on!
- Whoa!

08:27.741 --> 08:29.274
[both grunts]

08:29.276 --> 08:32.644
James? Mr. Smee?

08:32.646 --> 08:38.016
The Zebra Rose...
for you, m'lady!

08:38.018 --> 08:40.051
[inhales deeply]

08:40.053 --> 08:42.854
Why, how wonderful, James.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.791
- I didn't know you cared...
- Why, of course I care...

08:46.793 --> 08:49.861
- ...about Jake and his ship!
- Jake and his... what now?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.930
Um, sorry, Madam...

08:51.932 --> 08:55.233
I'm afraid we're
both a tad confused!

08:55.235 --> 08:59.771
Why Jake and his
spunky crew came here
to find the Zebra Rose.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.873
They need it to cure
their ship, Bucky,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.643
of a bad case of
Buccaneer Barnacles.

09:04.645 --> 09:10.582
And you sweet man,
you found it for them!
Thank ye ever so much!

09:10.584 --> 09:12.083
[sighs]

09:12.085 --> 09:13.985
That's our cap'n.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.887
Ahoy, Jake!

09:15.889 --> 09:17.322
Ahoy, Red Jessica!

09:17.324 --> 09:21.059
Captain Hook was
good enough to find
the rose for ya!

09:21.061 --> 09:23.828
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.731
Um, and thank you,
too, Captain Hook.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.734
Don't mention it, Jake.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.572
Come on, crew!
Let's get down to the
dock and help Bucky!

09:33.574 --> 09:36.074
Psst! Here ya go, cap'n.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.910
You... you kept the red rose?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.212
Had a hunch you
might need it, sir.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.315
[clearing throat]

09:43.317 --> 09:46.051
I picked another rose today.

09:46.053 --> 09:50.889
A fair red rose for
a fair pirate lass.

09:50.891 --> 09:55.226
Oh James, it's beautiful.
Red is my favorite color!

09:55.228 --> 09:57.128
Thank you ever so much.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.031
Oh, why, well...

10:00.033 --> 10:02.601
Of course.

10:04.036 --> 10:08.740
Yo-ho, Bucky, we did it!
We found the Zebra Rose!

10:08.742 --> 10:10.609
[clanging]

10:10.611 --> 10:13.044
Get a whiff of
this, Barnacles.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.679
[Barnacles giggling]

10:14.681 --> 10:16.214
[sneezing]

10:16.216 --> 10:19.017
[Cubby] Check it out!
The sweet rosy smell

10:19.019 --> 10:21.853
is making 'em
sneeze and fall off!

10:21.855 --> 10:25.023
[sneezes]

10:25.025 --> 10:27.158
Yo-ho, we did it!

10:27.160 --> 10:29.995
We got the Buccaneer
Barnacles off of Bucky!

10:29.997 --> 10:32.764
And we got four more
gold doubloons!

10:32.766 --> 10:36.167
Let's grab and sail on
back to Pirate Island.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.303
On a tickle-free ship!

10:38.305 --> 10:41.272
- [clanging]
- [all] You're welcome, Bucky!

10:43.042 --> 10:46.177
Thanks for helping us cure
Bucky's barnacles, mateys!

10:46.179 --> 10:47.946
Bucky feels better.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.783
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.092
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:01.094 --> 11:03.128
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:03.130 --> 11:05.196
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:05.198 --> 11:08.099
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:08.101 --> 11:10.402
Come on. Count with us.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.171
[all] Yeah!

11:14.240 --> 11:16.908
[Izzy] One, two, three...

11:16.910 --> 11:19.044
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

11:19.046 --> 11:22.347
[Jake] Seven, eight, nine, ten.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.450
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:25.452 --> 11:27.952
we got 10 gold doubloons!

11:27.954 --> 11:29.921
[giggling]

11:29.923 --> 11:34.693
Crackers! I think Cubby's
got one of those tickling
barnacles stuck on him!

11:34.695 --> 11:39.297
[laughing]
No, I just remembered
how funny we sounded

11:39.299 --> 11:42.133
roarin' like Lion Flies!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.769
[all laugh]

11:44.771 --> 11:46.404
[roars]

11:48.008 --> 11:52.143
Something's gotten into
the Jolly Roger, sir!

11:52.145 --> 11:54.312
She won't sail in
a straight line.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.748
Maybe a ghost is
steering the ship?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.250
[sighs] Keep it down, ye louts!

11:59.252 --> 12:03.421
I am too busy being
joyous for a change.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.291
She loved my red rose!

12:06.293 --> 12:08.827
[sighs and chuckles]

12:08.829 --> 12:11.229
[Barnacles giggling]

12:16.202 --> 12:18.903
<i>[Jake]</i> Cubby's Pet Problem.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.105
[Stormy] Ahoy, mateys!

12:20.107 --> 12:22.741
Thanks for getting
here so fast, Stormy.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.809
You say you need
help with a map?

12:24.811 --> 12:28.246
Yep, it's a map of the
bottom of the Never Sea.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.783
And it shows where to
find the Cave of Neptune!

12:31.785 --> 12:34.919
Dancing dolphins!
I've heard of that place.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.256
Legend says that an amazing
sea creature lives there!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.158
But no one's ever seen it.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.327
Say, mateys,
let's check it out.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.130
Yeah, and I can
show you the way!

12:45.132 --> 12:48.466
Would you like to go find
the Cave of Neptune with us?

12:50.103 --> 12:54.239
Remember to keep a look out
for gold doubloons.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.375
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.079
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.149
Yo-ho, let's go on a
sea serpent search!

13:07.419 --> 13:10.889
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:10.891 --> 13:13.224
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:13.226 --> 13:17.929
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:17.931 --> 13:21.065
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:21.067 --> 13:23.134
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:25.070 --> 13:28.807
Hold up, Bucky!
Neptune City is
right below us!

13:28.809 --> 13:31.142
It's time to go underwater.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.581
- Wow.
- Awesome.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.083
[bell clangs]

13:39.085 --> 13:42.320
[all] Dive! Dive! Dive!

13:44.123 --> 13:47.325
[Cubby]
Cave of Neptune, here we come!

13:47.327 --> 13:49.861
- Cool!
- Wild!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.095
[Cubby] According to my map,

13:51.097 --> 13:53.498
the Cave of Neptune
is right around here.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.100
Come on, let's get
a closer look!

13:58.904 --> 14:01.940
Wow, you guys have
the coolest stuff.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.176
[wailing]

14:05.178 --> 14:08.346
Shiver me shellfish!
What was that?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.281
[Jake] It came from over there.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.988
I bet this is the
Cave of Neptune.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.389
[Izzy] It's so big.

14:18.391 --> 14:22.093
And whatever made that
big noise sounded big, too!

14:22.095 --> 14:25.363
[wailing]

14:25.365 --> 14:28.299
Aw, coconuts!
Here it comes!

14:29.935 --> 14:31.436
[squeaking]

14:31.438 --> 14:34.539
Whoa! It's a baby sea serpent!

14:34.541 --> 14:38.142
[Izzy] Aw, did you
make that big noise?

14:38.144 --> 14:41.246
- [squeaks]
- That was probably his mother.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.949
- [squeaks]
- [giggles] That tickles!

14:44.951 --> 14:48.419
You're so slinky,
I'm going to call you Slink!

14:48.421 --> 14:51.289
Hey! Slink!
You like to play?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.957
Then fetch, Slink!

14:52.959 --> 14:56.194
[burbles]

14:56.196 --> 14:59.163
Aw, Slink wants to
play some more, Cubby.

14:59.165 --> 15:04.002
Flyin' flounders!
That's my sister
Marina's signal.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.938
It's lunchtime!
Nice meeting you, Slink.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.907
- Bye, everybody!
- See you soon!

15:08.909 --> 15:10.074
- Bye!
- So long!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.477
- Later!
- [wailing]

15:12.479 --> 15:14.612
Sounds like
Slink's mama again.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.681
She doesn't sound happy!

15:16.683 --> 15:20.184
And I don't want to find
out why! Let's yo-ho go!

15:20.186 --> 15:24.255
OK, Cubby.
All hands back on Bucky!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.523
[Cubby] So long, Slink!

15:25.525 --> 15:27.325
[sighs]

15:30.095 --> 15:34.198
There's nothing like
fresh crackers after
an undersea adventure!

15:34.200 --> 15:38.036
Yeah, but it sure would've been
fun to bring Slink back with us.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.972
Maybe, but Slink's too little
to be away from his mom.

15:40.974 --> 15:45.043
And besides, taking care of
a sea serpent can't be easy!

15:45.678 --> 15:48.179
Crackers! My crackers!

15:48.181 --> 15:50.181
They're gone!
Who could've...

15:50.183 --> 15:51.482
[chomping]

15:51.484 --> 15:54.285
[Skully] It's my crackers!

15:54.287 --> 15:56.454
And Slink!

15:56.456 --> 15:58.289
[Jake] He must've
followed us home!

15:58.291 --> 16:00.458
We've got to get
Slink back to his home.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.260
- And his mother!
- [whimpers]

16:02.262 --> 16:04.562
Slink! Come back!

16:04.564 --> 16:07.231
<i>¶ When a sea serpent</i>

16:29.588 --> 16:31.522
We'll never catch him.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.525
Maybe he'll come to us
if we play fetch!

16:34.527 --> 16:38.162
Come on, Slink!
Fetch the stick!

16:38.164 --> 16:41.099
Got you,
you slippery little guy!

16:41.101 --> 16:42.500
[squeaks]

16:42.502 --> 16:47.105
Way to go! We caught Slink
and got two gold doubloons!

16:47.107 --> 16:51.142
Let's grab 'em and go
take Slink back home!

16:51.144 --> 16:54.679
[Hook] What an adorable,
slimy little beast!

16:54.681 --> 17:00.685
Why, it's the cutest sea serpent
I ever did see, sir! [chuckles]

17:00.687 --> 17:04.222
I must have it.
It will be perfect
for me latest venture...

17:04.224 --> 17:07.358
..."Captain Hook's
Seaside Petting Zoo."

17:07.360 --> 17:12.363
A zoo? Oh! I mean, oh dear!

17:14.233 --> 17:16.200
You keep Slink busy, Cubby.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.704
We'll get Bucky ready to go
back to the Cave of Neptune.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.239
You got it, Jake.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.142
Slink could play fetch
all day if we let him!

17:24.144 --> 17:26.511
[grunts] Go, boy, go!

17:27.312 --> 17:30.148
So sorry, sea pup cubby!

17:30.150 --> 17:33.084
[Bones] Cap'n's orders,
you know how he is!

17:34.286 --> 17:35.620
Good work.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.688
- Now, lock it up below!
- [squeaking]

17:37.690 --> 17:42.193
Slink's not going
anywhere without me. No way!

17:42.195 --> 17:43.728
Whoa! [grunts]

17:43.730 --> 17:49.133
[Hook] Smee! Cast off and
set sail for Never Land!

17:49.135 --> 17:51.369
Apologies there,
little slimy guy.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.205
But the cap'n says you
have stay locked in here

17:54.207 --> 17:56.641
till we get to his new zoo.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.177
[squeaks]

17:59.179 --> 18:01.779
Slink! It's OK,
I'm here for ya!

18:01.781 --> 18:04.115
No one's going
to put you in a zoo!

18:04.117 --> 18:05.650
[squeaks]

18:05.652 --> 18:09.187
But, we've got a problem.
My mateys don't know where I am.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.721
I've got to find
a way to signal them

18:10.723 --> 18:13.491
and let them know
we need help! But how?

18:13.493 --> 18:18.296
- [squeaks]
- This is no time
to fetch, Slink.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.866
- [toots]
- Huh?

18:21.868 --> 18:24.635
You made a flute out
of that hollow stick!

18:24.637 --> 18:27.872
I can signal my mateys
with it by playing a song!

18:27.874 --> 18:32.210
[playing theme song]

18:32.212 --> 18:35.346
- [Jake] Cubby!
- [Izzy] Where are you?

18:35.348 --> 18:39.350
Sorry, guys, but I don't
see Cubby or Slink anywhere.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.152
Where could they have gone?

18:41.154 --> 18:42.487
[faint tune playing]

18:42.489 --> 18:45.790
Hey! Somebody's
playing our song.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.461
It's coming from
the Jolly Roger!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.263
But who could be playing it?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.498
[both] Cubby!

18:53.500 --> 18:55.666
I hope my song worked.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.669
[Stormy] Ahoy!
Pirate friends? Is that you?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.738
Cubby! I heard your song!

19:00.740 --> 19:05.443
Way-hey! Our signal worked and
we got two more gold doubloons!

19:05.445 --> 19:08.779
Let's grab 'em and
go talk to Stormy!

19:08.781 --> 19:12.850
Hook's trying to put
Slink in a zoo, and
we've got to stop him!

19:12.852 --> 19:15.653
Hm... maybe I can help?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.390
Yo-ho, what do you know?

19:19.392 --> 19:21.826
Maybe this stick can
help us get out of here!

19:21.828 --> 19:25.363
Ah, Mr. Smee.
What a wonderful day!

19:25.365 --> 19:30.234
That little sea beast is going
to be the star of me new zoo!

19:30.236 --> 19:34.639
Oh, I do hate to rain on
your wonderful day, sir. But...

19:34.641 --> 19:37.708
Ahoy! Jolly Roger!

19:37.710 --> 19:39.443
We heard Cubby's signal,

19:39.445 --> 19:41.946
and we know he's
on board your ship.

19:41.948 --> 19:46.184
Smee, what is that puny
pirate bellowing about?

19:46.186 --> 19:49.220
- [Cubby] Us!
- [squeaks]

19:49.222 --> 19:54.859
Ah-ha! So a
teensy-weensy stowaway
is trying to steal away

19:54.861 --> 19:57.261
the star attraction of me zoo?

19:57.263 --> 20:02.266
Well, rest assured,
nothing is going to get
me to stop this ship!

20:02.268 --> 20:04.302
[wailing]

20:04.304 --> 20:06.270
What, pray tell, was that?!

20:06.272 --> 20:10.641
Captain Hook, I'd like you
to meet Slink's mother!

20:10.643 --> 20:12.910

20:12.912 --> 20:14.512

20:14.514 --> 20:18.849
Smee! Steer us clear
of that mommy!

20:18.851 --> 20:21.819
Mommy, yes! [screams]

20:23.522 --> 20:25.990
[Stormy] Uh oh, now
you've made her mad!

20:25.992 --> 20:27.291
Blast.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.861
- [wailing]
- [all screaming]

20:30.863 --> 20:33.798
We got to get Cubby
and Slink to abandon ship!

20:33.800 --> 20:35.666
This is an emergency!

20:35.668 --> 20:39.237
Which means...
Pixie dust away!

20:43.842 --> 20:46.777
- Thanks, Izzy!
- Any time!

20:46.779 --> 20:49.814
Yay-hey! We saved
Cubby and Slink

20:49.816 --> 20:52.783
and got six more
gold doubloons.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.952
Let's grab 'em and go!

20:54.954 --> 20:59.290
[Hook] Blast you!

21:01.293 --> 21:03.327
Thanks for
the help Stormy!

21:03.329 --> 21:06.864
- No problem.
- [wailing happily]

21:06.866 --> 21:09.433
And thank you too,
Mrs. Sea Serpent.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.271
- We got your baby
back safe and sound!
- [squeaking]

21:13.273 --> 21:14.972
[wailing]

21:14.974 --> 21:18.876
Well, Slink, I...
I guess this is
good-bye for now.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.344
[whines]

21:20.346 --> 21:23.047
Don't be sad.
I'll see you again soon.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.283
Hey! Why don't you
keep this stick

21:25.285 --> 21:27.351
so we can play some more
when we come visit you?

21:27.353 --> 21:29.654
[squeaks]

21:31.023 --> 21:32.957
[burbles happily]

21:35.427 --> 21:37.028
- Fair winds!
- Bye!

21:37.030 --> 21:38.663
- [Izzy] Bye!

Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

21:44.070 --> 21:46.404
Thanks for helping us
with Slink!

21:46.406 --> 21:50.708

our Gold Doubloons
into our Team Treasure Chest!

we got ten gold doubloons.

22:28.014 --> 22:32.550
Crackers! My crackers are
gone again! Is Slink back?

22:35.520 --> 22:39.123
Sorry, but there's nothing
better than fresh crackers

22:39.125 --> 22:42.093
after an undersea adventure!

22:44.062 --> 22:48.499
Alas, no beasts
have I for me zoo.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.736
Cheer up, cap'n!
We brought you some beasties!
