FOR THE HEADACHE

21:25.834 --> 21:27.700
YOU GOT FROM WEARING
SOMEONE ELSE'S GLASSES

21:27.700 --> 21:31.600
AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING
YOUR CLASSROOM.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.133
AND THIS ONE IS
FOR PRETENDING TO BE
A RUSSIAN GYMNAST

21:34.133 --> 21:38.133
AND BRUISING EVERY BONE
IN YOUR BODY.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.967
NOW, I HOPE YOU KIDS LEARNED
A LESSON FROM ALL THIS.

21:43.967 --> 21:47.767
BE YOURSELF.
BE YOURSELF.

21:47.767 --> 21:50.700
IT'S A LOT LESS PAINFUL.

21:55.867 --> 21:58.500
AHH.
AHH.

22:29.767 --> 22:30.767
Man: YEAH!
