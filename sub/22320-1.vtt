"The first meal..."

08:02.532 --> 08:04.930
No, no, no, Mr. Atkinson.

08:04.932 --> 08:07.664
I completely understand. I know it's late.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.463
The reason why I'm
actually calling is beca...

08:09.465 --> 08:12.165
I'm literally just walking
from the office now.

08:12.167 --> 08:15.766
Yeah, we got some news in today
that I thought I'd run by you.

08:16.866 --> 08:18.564
Yeah, um...

08:18.566 --> 08:20.198
we got another offer

08:20.200 --> 08:22.000
on the house that you really like.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.566
Yeah, I know, these things
happen all the time, sir.

08:26.599 --> 08:28.463
How are you? All right. Yeah.

08:28.465 --> 08:30.164
Can I get the usual please?

08:30.166 --> 08:33.231
Um, an Italian thin crust pizza.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.297
Pepperoni, obviously.

08:35.299 --> 08:39.765
Um, can you do me that... that
sour cream dip that you guys do?

08:41.331 --> 08:45.466
Yeah, um, one strawberry cheesecake.

08:47.366 --> 08:48.931
Yeah, and, um...

08:48.933 --> 08:52.600
could you throw in like
a cheeky bottle of coke?

08:53.598 --> 08:55.566
Yeah. You letch.

08:56.498 --> 08:58.397
You know my address, yeah?

08:58.399 --> 09:01.067
Okay. All right, then, how
long would that be roughly?

09:01.900 --> 09:04.897
All right. Yeah, no worries.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.500
All right, take care.

09:28.633 --> 09:29.899
Hey.

09:30.598 --> 09:31.867
You all right?

09:33.499 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, how's it going?

09:37.199 --> 09:38.566
Nice.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.897
Yeah, when are you back?

09:41.899 --> 09:43.496
Yeah, no, that shouldn't be a problem.

09:43.498 --> 09:46.166
Let me... write it down.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.330
Yeah, go on.

09:49.332 --> 09:50.700
What was that?

09:52.365 --> 09:55.533
Terminal... 2.

09:56.232 --> 09:58.866
12:22.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.564
Yeah. Not a problem.

10:01.566 --> 10:02.866
I'll be there.

10:03.565 --> 10:05.263
Of course I will.

10:05.265 --> 10:06.565
For you, anything.

12:34.566 --> 12:35.631
What the fuck?

13:55.866 --> 13:57.400
Fuck. Fuck.

15:45.532 --> 15:46.630
No, no, no.

15:46.632 --> 15:47.929
The last thing I'm trying to do, sir,

15:47.931 --> 15:50.464
is to pressure anyone
into making a decision

15:50.466 --> 15:53.197
that they don't want to go through.

15:53.199 --> 15:55.630
Yeah, and 15 percent is the
preferable rate these days,

15:55.632 --> 15:57.863
but I know some vendors that
are willing to offer 10 percent.

15:57.865 --> 16:00.196
And if I'm being completely
honest with you, sir,

16:00.198 --> 16:02.463
I saw you. Your aura...

16:02.465 --> 16:05.730
and... the whole ambiance in the house...

16:05.732 --> 16:08.164
that just connected really well.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.197
So I'll let you sleep on it.

16:09.199 --> 16:10.063
Then you can let me know

16:10.065 --> 16:11.497
what you want to do in the morning.

16:11.499 --> 16:12.832
You have a good night.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.400
Oh, shit.

16:48.266 --> 16:51.363
So... yeah. Listen, man, I need to re-up.

16:52.431 --> 16:54.430
Yeah, quick one.

16:54.432 --> 16:56.399
It's been like two
scores or something, yeah?

17:02.865 --> 17:06.464
That right-wing pussy
telling me to black it up.

17:06.465 --> 17:07.862
Is he mental?

17:16.665 --> 17:21.195
So! So! So!

17:21.198 --> 17:22.530
Your lift stinks.

17:22.531 --> 17:24.665
Shut up, man. That's you
that stinks, not my lift.

17:25.365 --> 17:27.632
Bruv, I mean, it's so quick.

17:36.632 --> 17:38.164
What are you wearing?

17:38.166 --> 17:39.396
What do you mean, what am I wearing?

17:39.398 --> 17:41.163
Why are you dressed like that?

17:41.165 --> 17:42.699
Went to a casting, innit?

17:43.399 --> 17:45.730
Oh, yeah. How did it go?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.929
Bruv, the director,
walks up to me and goes,

17:47.931 --> 17:50.899
"Excuse me, mate, do
you mind blacking it up?"

17:52.598 --> 17:53.764
- What?
- Yeah.

17:53.766 --> 17:55.133
I looked at him and goes,

17:55.832 --> 17:58.297
"How much more black can I get?"

17:58.299 --> 18:00.396
- So, what did you do?
- I had enough of that.

18:00.398 --> 18:02.699
Afterwards, he comes up to me and goes...

18:03.899 --> 18:05.397
"Do you mind adding a 'motherfucker'."

18:05.399 --> 18:07.829
Like, because I'm black

18:07.831 --> 18:09.565
I have to say "motherfucker."

18:10.398 --> 18:11.932
Just racist, innit?

18:12.832 --> 18:14.499
Now, imagine you're at the office...

18:15.632 --> 18:17.563
and someone comes up to you and says.

18:17.565 --> 18:20.666
"Hussein, do you want this bacon sandwich?"

18:22.332 --> 18:23.833
Would you eat it?

18:25.265 --> 18:26.600
Yeah.

18:27.865 --> 18:29.796
'Cause I eat bacon.

18:29.798 --> 18:31.633
Isn't it against your laws?

18:32.332 --> 18:33.666
I mean, yeah...

18:34.466 --> 18:37.364
but I eat pepperoni as well, so...

18:37.366 --> 18:38.796
There's no much difference, innit?

18:38.798 --> 18:40.400
But is it halal, though?

18:41.231 --> 18:43.633
There's no such thing as halal pig.

18:45.632 --> 18:46.999
Halal that.

18:51.199 --> 18:52.600
All right, cool.

21:14.698 --> 21:16.432
Hey, you all right?

21:17.732 --> 21:19.396
What?

21:19.398 --> 21:20.666
Already?

21:21.366 --> 21:22.896
Now, wait a minute.

21:22.898 --> 21:25.696
I thought you said 3 p.m.

21:25.698 --> 21:28.018
That's what I've got written
down. That's what you told me.

21:29.465 --> 21:31.666
Wha... So what are you gonna do?

21:33.266 --> 21:35.800
A-All right, all right,
I'll come now then, won't I?

21:36.564 --> 21:37.862
W-Wha...

21:37.864 --> 21:39.596
Okay. Chill out.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.399
I'll pick you up from the station then.

21:42.731 --> 21:44.429
Yeah.

21:44.431 --> 21:46.264
Hello?

21:46.266 --> 21:47.799
Hello?

21:48.498 --> 21:50.695
For fuck's sake, man.

21:50.697 --> 21:52.766
You told me 3 p.m.

21:53.632 --> 21:54.897
So it's my fault, innit?

21:54.899 --> 21:56.229
I can never do anything right.

24:14.431 --> 24:16.595
- You got me a present?
- No, I didn't get you one.

24:16.597 --> 24:19.197
Why would I get you a present?

24:19.199 --> 24:20.363
Look, I wrote it down on the wall.

24:20.365 --> 24:21.663
- Where?
- On the fridge.

24:21.665 --> 24:23.364
I told you I did. There.

24:23.366 --> 24:25.563
Oh, my God. The hell are...

24:25.565 --> 24:26.729
Oh, my God!

24:26.731 --> 24:28.662
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

24:28.664 --> 24:31.164
Oh, my God! W... Where did these come from?

24:31.166 --> 24:33.297
- Get rid of them!
- I'm trying to get rid of them!

24:33.299 --> 24:35.139
- Can you give me a towel or something...
- No!

24:36.266 --> 24:38.163
- Come on, man.
- No, I'm scared.

24:38.165 --> 24:40.196
- Well, what am I trying to do?
- Open the door!

24:40.198 --> 24:41.896
I need one. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

24:41.898 --> 24:43.462
Give me a towel, quick.

24:43.464 --> 24:45.296
No! Talk to them.

24:45.298 --> 24:48.264
Talk to them? I don't know
how to talk to the pigeons.

24:48.266 --> 24:49.663
Hey, pigeon.

24:51.631 --> 24:52.896
No!

24:52.898 --> 24:54.230
Get off my chair, man.

24:54.232 --> 24:55.462
Get off!

24:55.464 --> 24:56.929
Go! Go! Go!

24:56.931 --> 24:59.362
Man! Oh, they've
shit on my La-Z-Boy.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.798
Fuck, man.

25:10.331 --> 25:12.630
I swear I never left that window open.

25:12.632 --> 25:15.563
Well, you clearly did.
Have you not got any food?

25:15.565 --> 25:16.830
There's loads of food in there.

25:16.832 --> 25:18.362
You haven't even got teabags?

25:18.364 --> 25:19.896
What're you talking about.
I can see two teabags

25:19.898 --> 25:21.263
with my own eyes right there.

25:21.265 --> 25:22.662
- Where?
- On the counter.

25:22.664 --> 25:23.830
They're used.

25:23.832 --> 25:25.763
It's called recycling.

25:25.765 --> 25:26.862
Wow.

25:26.864 --> 25:29.428
I'm not your fucking houseboy.

25:29.430 --> 25:31.663
I'm a professional salesman.

25:31.665 --> 25:34.264
I ain't got time to be
fucking buying food for you.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.530
- So I'll go shop, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:35.532 --> 25:37.362
I think that's a great idea.

25:37.364 --> 25:40.164
Okay, cool. I'll go shop, so
we can eat some food tonight.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.630
- How 'bout that?
- Can you get me some...

25:42.632 --> 25:43.696
chocolate chip cookies?

25:43.698 --> 25:44.999
No, I can't.

25:54.832 --> 25:56.099
Glass of red?

25:57.166 --> 25:58.500
Oh!

26:14.731 --> 26:16.664
Game over.

26:30.397 --> 26:31.866
This is nice.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.432
Came to 35 quid.

26:36.798 --> 26:38.466
What, you're asking for money now?

26:39.330 --> 26:40.831
We said half and half.

26:41.698 --> 26:43.499
Half the bills, half the rent.

26:46.532 --> 26:47.998
I'll pay you tomorrow.

26:49.498 --> 26:51.329
What do you want me to do?

26:51.331 --> 26:53.295
Run out of the house now,
run to the bank or something?

26:53.297 --> 26:54.730
I'm just saying.

26:54.732 --> 26:57.429
And I'm just saying, what if
your food was actually dead.

26:57.431 --> 26:59.630
Okay, cool.

26:59.632 --> 27:02.099
I'm going to bed, yeah?
You can do the washing up.

28:23.264 --> 28:24.929
Breakfast is served.

28:24.931 --> 28:27.196
Morning.

28:27.198 --> 28:28.530
Morning.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.195
- Listen...
- That's nice.

28:30.197 --> 28:31.262
I'm so sorry, yeah?

28:31.264 --> 28:34.296
Don't be sorry. Just be nicer.

28:34.298 --> 28:37.196
I didn't mean to write
the wrong time down, did I?

28:37.198 --> 28:40.096
Yeah, I didn't mean to be a
massive bitch, but fucking hell.

28:40.098 --> 28:42.363
I think I was feeling
hemmed in or something.

28:42.365 --> 28:44.229
My head weren't in the right place.

28:44.231 --> 28:45.799
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

28:49.564 --> 28:51.431
Listen, I was thinking

28:52.130 --> 28:53.262
we should do something today.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.963
- What?
- Like...

28:55.965 --> 28:58.833
- go to the cinema, watch a film.
- Mm.

28:59.964 --> 29:01.230
Go and get some more food.

29:01.232 --> 29:02.596
What food?

29:02.598 --> 29:03.996
Go to the Chicken Shop.

29:03.998 --> 29:05.129
Okay.

29:05.131 --> 29:06.597
- You like the Chicken Shop?
- Yeah.

29:06.599 --> 29:08.200
Then we can come back...

29:08.930 --> 29:10.529
and then I can...

29:10.531 --> 29:12.531
What's that?

29:13.365 --> 29:15.028
What's that?

29:15.030 --> 29:16.396
- It's the...
- What?

29:16.398 --> 29:18.963
- The Slider.
- The Slider.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.496
Yeah, it's time for the Slider.

29:20.498 --> 29:22.529
You need to work on your moves.

29:22.531 --> 29:24.229
You know I can always use the Slider.

29:24.231 --> 29:25.862
You need to work on your Slider.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.195
Your Slider's dead.

29:27.197 --> 29:29.029
- You said the Slider was good.
- Mmm.

29:29.031 --> 29:30.529
That's not what you were saying.

29:30.531 --> 29:32.395
I faked it.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.162
What?

29:34.164 --> 29:35.263
You faked it?

29:35.265 --> 29:37.096
I'm so sorry.

29:37.098 --> 29:39.128
Stop it.

29:39.130 --> 29:41.162
- Were you faking that now as well?
- Yeah.

29:41.164 --> 29:43.330
Yeah, but that's different.
That's tickling me.

29:43.332 --> 29:46.029
Oh! You're meant to be nice.

29:46.031 --> 29:47.597
- I'm being nice.
- No, you're not.

29:47.599 --> 29:49.496
- I am.
- No, you're not. You're being...

29:50.330 --> 29:52.330
- Do you wanna be any louder?
- Yeah.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.429
I'll fucking scream the place down.

29:54.431 --> 29:56.128
You're meant to be nice to me.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.596
Stop it. I don't
like it when you play.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.396
Mmm.

30:03.398 --> 30:05.195
You said my Slider was dead.

30:05.197 --> 30:08.096
- Dead.
- No...

30:08.098 --> 30:09.895
Fine, I ain't
gonna bring out the Slider.

30:09.897 --> 30:11.363
No, I'm joking.

30:11.365 --> 30:12.928
I'll give you The Brown Hammer.

30:12.930 --> 30:16.498
The Brown Hammer...

30:24.130 --> 30:27.195
♪ I know you and you know
me and I know you, yeah ♪

30:27.197 --> 30:30.028
♪ That's my other half,
she stick to me like glue ♪

30:30.030 --> 30:31.263
What are you doing?

30:31.265 --> 30:33.263
- I didn't do that on purpose.
- Don't lie.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.230
Don't get ugly.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.062
What if my head was to
crack into that door.

30:36.064 --> 30:37.395
Oh, you're so dramatic.

30:37.397 --> 30:39.162
You wouldn't be living
in this amazing flat then.

30:39.164 --> 30:41.162
- You do know that, right?
- Are you serious?

30:41.164 --> 30:42.665
This place ain't amazing?

30:43.564 --> 30:44.963
- Mmm, it's all right.
- What?

30:44.965 --> 30:46.230
It'll do.

30:46.232 --> 30:47.563
So what would you change about it then?

30:47.565 --> 30:50.095
I'd get some plants in,
I'd get some candles in,

30:50.097 --> 30:51.396
I'd get some quotes.

30:51.398 --> 30:53.128
Quotes, all right. Quotes I can work with.

30:53.130 --> 30:54.262
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All right.

30:54.264 --> 30:55.597
We can do that. Can you, um...

30:55.599 --> 30:56.863
help me when you're done.

30:56.865 --> 30:58.430
Yeah,

30:58.432 --> 31:00.028
I can.

31:00.030 --> 31:02.096
What time are you home tonight?

31:02.098 --> 31:04.928
Um, probably later than usual

31:04.930 --> 31:06.230
- because...
- What?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.299
I've got to impress my first day back.

31:09.131 --> 31:10.563
But you said tonight we're gonna...

31:10.565 --> 31:11.496
What?

31:11.498 --> 31:13.928
- Put you against the wall.
- Yeah, we can,

31:13.930 --> 31:15.430
but I'm just gonna have to be later.

31:15.432 --> 31:16.262
All right.

31:16.264 --> 31:18.395
You better sell five houses today.

31:18.397 --> 31:19.862
- Five?
- Yeah.

31:19.864 --> 31:21.196
I mean, I got twelve lined up already.

31:21.198 --> 31:22.463
Oh, you're so full of it.

32:57.431 --> 32:59.329
Take these off.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.929
Come, then. Show me what you've got.

33:04.931 --> 33:06.063
Show you what I've got?

33:06.065 --> 33:07.362
- Oh, it's like that now?
- Yeah.

33:07.364 --> 33:09.062
- It's competition time?
- Yeah.

33:09.064 --> 33:10.530
- Last time that happened...
- Mmm.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.863
I'm sure I won.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.398
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:25.065 --> 33:26.399
Mmm.

33:30.064 --> 33:32.264
- Hello.
- Mmm.

33:32.964 --> 33:34.331
Hello.

33:40.365 --> 33:42.531
What's going on? Why is it not...

33:43.231 --> 33:45.098
Oh, for fuck's sake.

33:47.064 --> 33:48.731
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

33:49.464 --> 33:51.229
Why are you so ugly?

33:51.231 --> 33:53.711
It's all right. You ain't got
to be Mr. Lova Lova all the time.

33:55.198 --> 33:56.596
- All the time?
- Yeah.

33:56.598 --> 33:58.195
- It's fine.
- Of course I have to.

33:58.197 --> 34:00.528
No, you don't, man. It happens.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.496
And when is the last
time this happened to me?

34:02.498 --> 34:04.862
Before I went on a holiday.

34:04.864 --> 34:07.296
There's been so many times we're about
to have sex and you can't get it up.

34:07.298 --> 34:08.561
So what? All this is my fault?

34:08.563 --> 34:10.563
No, I'm just saying it's probably the weed.

34:11.897 --> 34:13.228
Messes with your libido, innit?

34:13.231 --> 34:14.629
- It's not the weed.
- It's not the weed, no?

34:14.630 --> 34:16.629
- Nah, it's not the weed.
- What is it then?

34:16.630 --> 34:18.629
It's you.

34:18.630 --> 34:20.027
It's your fault. It's not my fault.

34:20.030 --> 34:21.398
Why would it be my fault?

34:22.097 --> 34:23.562
'Cause you got a flat arse.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.096
That's why.

34:25.098 --> 34:26.532
How else can I not get it up?

34:27.264 --> 34:29.027
There's nothing even there, man.

34:29.030 --> 34:30.896
Cool.

34:30.898 --> 34:32.395
Prick.

35:10.898 --> 35:12.698
I feel like dog shit, man.

35:13.464 --> 35:15.199
Well, you look like dog shit.

35:18.897 --> 35:19.996
What?

35:19.998 --> 35:22.095
- That's funny?
- Yeah.

35:22.097 --> 35:24.929
You're such a pussy. Man
up. Grow some balls, man.

35:24.931 --> 35:26.331
Man-flu?

35:35.496 --> 35:37.528
- Have you seen my diamond tiepin?
- No.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.163
- What do you mean no?
- I mean no.

35:39.165 --> 35:40.832
We all great, innit?

35:43.098 --> 35:45.198
Shut up, man.

35:47.331 --> 35:49.164
So rude.

36:43.197 --> 36:45.098
Where is it? Oh.

37:27.264 --> 37:29.531
"Big monster dick."

37:30.330 --> 37:32.797
"Big monster dick."

37:34.030 --> 37:37.465
"Soldier in my Ass."

37:43.065 --> 37:47.664
"Suck My Nine Inch in a Gloryhole."

37:52.564 --> 37:54.630
"Monkeys in the Shower."

37:58.965 --> 38:01.098
"Cock-a-cock."

39:50.097 --> 39:52.161
- Oh, that's funny?
- That's not me.

39:52.163 --> 39:53.863
So, what is this? Why is it cut?

39:53.865 --> 39:55.194
I don't know.

39:55.196 --> 39:56.129
I left this morning, Mel.

39:56.131 --> 39:57.862
I found out mid-day whilst I was at work

39:57.864 --> 39:59.362
walking around like a fucking dickhead.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.429
Oh, there's no change
there. Is there, Hussein?

40:01.431 --> 40:02.995
Come on, Mel, man. I'm being serious.

40:02.997 --> 40:04.229
So am I, being serious.

40:04.231 --> 40:05.394
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

40:05.396 --> 40:07.029
- And what about my phone?
- What's... What?

40:07.031 --> 40:08.529
- What did you do to it?
- What do you mean?

40:08.531 --> 40:10.261
I put it on charge last night next to you.

40:10.263 --> 40:12.062
- Okay, cool.
- That's not funny.

40:12.064 --> 40:14.862
I walked out this morning, and
it was fucking zero percent.

40:14.864 --> 40:17.295
- Okay, what about my laptop?
- What about your laptop?

40:17.297 --> 40:19.362
Why is there porn on my laptop?

40:19.364 --> 40:21.329
- I don't know.
- You've been watching porn on my laptop?

40:21.331 --> 40:22.394
- No!
- No?

40:22.396 --> 40:23.494
- No!
- Okay.

40:23.496 --> 40:25.862
I don't watch porn on your laptop.

40:25.864 --> 40:29.361
Okay, so you're telling me, Hussein, that.

40:29.363 --> 40:31.261
"Soldier in My Arse" isn't you?

40:31.263 --> 40:33.162
- What?
- You've been watching gay porn on my laptop?

40:33.164 --> 40:34.561
- No, I haven't.
- I took this to work today.

40:34.563 --> 40:36.162
You know my boss, he saw that today.

40:36.164 --> 40:38.195
It's disgusting. It's actually rank.

40:38.197 --> 40:39.996
- Mel.
- What?

40:39.998 --> 40:41.529
I haven't been watching
gay porn on your laptop.

40:41.531 --> 40:43.195
What else has been
watching porn on my laptop?

40:43.197 --> 40:45.863
Why... Who else lives here?

40:45.865 --> 40:47.628
- Don't ask me dumb questions.
- Who else lives here?

40:47.630 --> 40:49.562
- No one.
- Okay, so just you and me live here, yeah?

40:49.564 --> 40:51.863
- Yeah.
- So you're telling me that somehow

40:51.865 --> 40:54.095
a ghost is watching porn on my laptop?

40:54.097 --> 40:56.995
- I don't know what "Solider in My Arse" is.
- Is that what turns you on?

40:56.997 --> 40:59.561
Is that what turns you on? You
know, it actually makes sense.

40:59.563 --> 41:01.128
That's why you can't get it up, ain't it?

41:01.130 --> 41:02.529
'Cause you like dick.

41:02.531 --> 41:03.996
Mel.

41:03.998 --> 41:05.494
I haven't been watching
gay porn on your laptop.

41:05.496 --> 41:06.764
And what the hell is this?

41:09.564 --> 41:11.495
- They're your knickers.
- Yeah, what's that?

41:11.497 --> 41:13.094
- Ugh! I don't know.
- It's your cum.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.028
- No, that's not.
- Yes, it is your cum.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.863
Why're you wanking over my knickers for?

41:16.865 --> 41:19.028
- You've been trying...
- That's nasty, Mel. I would not do that.

41:19.030 --> 41:20.629
I can't believe I
actually let you touch me.

41:20.631 --> 41:23.095
- It wasn't me. I didn't do anything.
- Whatever.

41:23.097 --> 41:24.596
- Why don't you ever understand?
- You're sick!

41:24.598 --> 41:26.099
You never listen.

42:28.598 --> 42:30.362
Oh, my God!

42:30.364 --> 42:31.462
- Hussein.
- Yeah.

42:31.464 --> 42:33.395
- Come flush the toilet.
- What?

42:33.397 --> 42:34.495
Flush the toilet.

42:34.497 --> 42:35.529
Why? I never used it.

42:35.531 --> 42:37.228
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

42:37.230 --> 42:38.895
You've done a shit, and
you've not flushed it.

42:38.897 --> 42:40.194
It's disgusting. Flush it.

42:40.196 --> 42:41.628
- I haven't shit yet.
- I'm not flushing that.

42:41.630 --> 42:43.162
What? Oh!

42:43.164 --> 42:45.461
- That's nasty.
- Yeah, it's nasty. Flush it.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.231
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

42:48.197 --> 42:50.628
- What do you want me to do?
- What are you lying?

42:50.630 --> 42:53.061
- I'm not lying.
- Yes, you are lying.

42:53.063 --> 42:56.328
- No, I'm not.
- And I guess you never used this, no?

42:56.330 --> 42:58.596
- No.
- This is my shampoo. You know that, right?

42:58.598 --> 43:00.194
- Yes.
- Cost me 40 pounds.

43:00.196 --> 43:01.963
It's empty.

43:01.965 --> 43:03.128
I've got my own shampoo.

43:03.130 --> 43:04.628
So use your own in the future.

43:04.630 --> 43:06.329
- I do...
- This is empty.

43:06.331 --> 43:09.462
This cost me 40 quid. You're so selfish.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.295
It's probably you overusing it.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.331
No, I haven't used it yet.

43:14.030 --> 43:15.531
All right.

43:17.463 --> 43:20.027
I can't even use that shampoo anyway.

43:20.029 --> 43:21.428
It don't even work in my head.

43:21.430 --> 43:22.862
I can't use that shampoo...

43:22.864 --> 43:24.561
I don't care whether
you can't use it or not.

43:24.563 --> 43:26.528
- I didn't do it.
- You're a compulsive liar, you know that?

43:26.530 --> 43:28.329
- I'm not lying.
- Yes, you are.

43:28.331 --> 43:30.461
You don't know the difference
between reality and a lie anymore.

43:30.463 --> 43:32.028
I didn't take a shit, and
I didn't use your shampoo.

43:32.030 --> 43:35.128
When are you gonna take these fucking
make-believe images out of your head?

43:35.130 --> 43:36.895
- It's not make-believe.
- Yes, it is make-believe.

43:36.897 --> 43:37.995
- No, it's not.
- It really is.

43:37.997 --> 43:39.863
- No, it's not.
- I haven't done it!

43:39.865 --> 43:42.261
I'm worried. You got
something wrong in your head.

43:42.263 --> 43:43.863
- Really? You think I'm mental?
- Yeah.

43:43.865 --> 43:45.261
You got bipolar or something.

43:45.263 --> 43:46.664
- You think I got bipolar?
- Yeah.

43:47.564 --> 43:49.328
You're a selfish asshole sometimes.

43:49.330 --> 43:50.528
- I'm selfish?
- Yeah.

43:50.530 --> 43:51.628
- Me?
- Yeah.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.027
When all I've done over these whole

43:53.029 --> 43:55.027
past few years is care for you.

43:55.029 --> 43:56.462
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:56.464 --> 43:58.261
- I've never not cared for you?
- And I've loved you.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.927
Yeah, have I loved you?

43:59.929 --> 44:02.061
- And I've allowed you to stay in this place.
- Ah, cool.

44:02.063 --> 44:03.562
- You've allowed me to stay in here, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:03.564 --> 44:06.195
Yeah, you've allowed me to
stay in here like I'm a burden?

44:06.197 --> 44:07.895
- How dare you?
- Is it not the truth?

44:07.897 --> 44:11.561
Whether it's the truth or
not, Hussein, how dare you!

44:11.563 --> 44:15.028
I stayed here 'cause I wanted to stay
here, not 'cause I needed to stay here.

44:15.030 --> 44:17.895
What, you think you're some amazing
estate agent, yeah? You're not.

44:17.897 --> 44:19.461
You're a little pussy, all right?

44:19.463 --> 44:21.428
Know that. I'm done.

44:21.430 --> 44:24.528
- You do that all the time.
- Do what? What do I do? What do I do?

44:24.530 --> 44:26.295
Just step away from the problem.

44:26.297 --> 44:28.531
You are the problem, Hussein.

44:32.296 --> 44:34.297
I think you should get ready for work.

44:36.996 --> 44:39.564
I won't be here when
you get back. I'm done.

44:41.964 --> 44:43.498
Cool.

44:48.897 --> 44:50.895
Don't call me and don't come
back knocking on my door.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.894
I ain't gonna call you.

44:52.896 --> 44:54.831
You fucking always do.

45:23.598 --> 45:26.131
Bon voyage.

47:17.164 --> 47:18.861
Oh, man!

47:18.863 --> 47:20.497
What the fuck is that?

47:22.597 --> 47:24.230
Ugh!

47:26.030 --> 47:28.062
So, what are you telling me?

47:28.064 --> 47:29.397
You've got a ghost?

47:30.863 --> 47:32.630
A ghost who shits.

47:33.564 --> 47:37.361
Well, how else do you explain it then, man?

47:37.363 --> 47:40.628
I don't know. I think your
bra is too tight or something.

47:40.630 --> 47:42.294
I don't wear a bra.

47:42.296 --> 47:44.961
I'm telling you, it was all her.

47:44.963 --> 47:46.395
I hear you.

47:46.397 --> 47:48.298
But you didn't see the size of...

47:48.996 --> 47:50.395
what I saw.

47:50.397 --> 47:52.561
It was a man's work, you know.

47:52.563 --> 47:54.628
Like a builder's work.
Know what I'm saying?

47:54.630 --> 47:56.461
Yeah, that's exactly what I said, bruv.

47:56.463 --> 47:58.561
You fucking dodged a
bullet with that one, mate.

47:58.563 --> 48:01.861
I told her. I actually told her...

48:01.863 --> 48:03.529
I laid down the plan.

48:03.531 --> 48:06.629
She was crying. Tears
running down her eyes.

48:06.631 --> 48:08.994
- Yeah?
- You know...

48:08.996 --> 48:11.895
"No, what? No, Hussein, don't do this.

48:11.897 --> 48:14.094
We can still be together."

48:14.096 --> 48:16.262
- Hmm.
- "Let's stay friends."

48:16.264 --> 48:17.361
Stay friends!

48:17.363 --> 48:19.961
- "I'll change." Fuck off!
- Fuck that.

48:19.963 --> 48:21.529
I got my life back now, innit?

48:21.531 --> 48:23.295
I'm a free man.

48:23.297 --> 48:25.095
- With the girls.
- Yeah, you're right.

48:25.097 --> 48:27.028
Yeah. You're right.

48:27.030 --> 48:31.198
And all you need to do now
is to stop looking like shit.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.829
Hello, Gerry.

51:25.831 --> 51:28.495
Yeah, mate. Um...

51:28.497 --> 51:29.960
Yeah, no, I'm not good, man.

51:29.962 --> 51:32.494
Listen, I've been meaning to ring you, man.

51:32.496 --> 51:35.629
Yeah, I'm iller than a
motherfucker right now, mate.

51:36.962 --> 51:39.628
Yeah, I can send you the schedule.

51:39.630 --> 51:40.931
Hm...

51:41.930 --> 51:44.764
Mmh, mmh...

51:58.731 --> 52:01.561
But I never even ordered one of these, man.

52:01.563 --> 52:04.328
Yeah, well, I dunno. Must be
a gift or something, innit?

52:04.330 --> 52:06.295
- A gift?
- Yeah.

52:06.297 --> 52:08.027
Who gets a freezer as a gift, mate?

52:08.029 --> 52:09.629
That's not our problem, is it?

52:09.631 --> 52:11.428
Look, if you don't want it, fair enough.

52:11.430 --> 52:12.893
But if you want to have it taken back,

52:12.895 --> 52:14.828
you're gonna have to
contact the depot yourself.

52:14.830 --> 52:18.498
- What?
- Yeah, you shouldn't have signed for it if you didn't want it.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.097
So immature, Mel.

52:34.396 --> 52:36.730
Oh, for fuck's sake, man.

52:37.464 --> 52:39.462
Hold on, what?

52:39.464 --> 52:42.030
What the fuck are you talking
about? Quilted for softness.

52:42.963 --> 52:44.698
Quilted for softness?

52:45.731 --> 52:48.262
You asked me for tissue,
and I gave you tissue.

52:48.264 --> 52:50.184
You're lucky I didn't
give you fucking sandpaper.

52:51.631 --> 52:53.527
No, man, I know. I'm grateful.

52:53.529 --> 52:55.395
Don't be grateful.

52:55.397 --> 52:56.893
Be embarrassed.

52:56.895 --> 52:58.196
Be ashamed.

53:00.963 --> 53:03.130
Listen, you staying for a puff or what?

53:04.297 --> 53:05.927
You what? What, share your joint?

53:05.929 --> 53:07.698
Yeah.

53:08.429 --> 53:10.960
And catch your herpes.

53:10.962 --> 53:13.428
Bruv, I rather eat onions.

53:13.430 --> 53:15.661
Look, I'm not doing
this bullshit again, man.

53:15.663 --> 53:17.697
I'm a busy man, you know?

53:18.597 --> 53:19.893
Yeah, I know you are but like I said,

53:19.895 --> 53:21.327
it was an emergency, wasn't it?

53:21.329 --> 53:23.028
- That why I needed you, bruv.
- Yeah.

53:23.030 --> 53:25.828
But, you know, when you get
yourself back on your feet, yeah,

53:25.830 --> 53:27.563
you owe me.

53:28.396 --> 53:31.294
Yeah. I'm starting to get better anyway.

53:31.296 --> 53:32.893
Look, I'm going to give
you some advice, yeah?

53:32.895 --> 53:34.530
You're gonna listen?

53:35.297 --> 53:36.931
Look up at the stars...

53:37.630 --> 53:39.064
and not at your feet.

53:40.330 --> 53:42.362
And try to make sense

53:42.364 --> 53:43.698
of what you see...

53:44.429 --> 53:46.427
and wonder...

53:46.429 --> 53:49.663
what really makes this universe exist.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.064
Be curious.

53:54.763 --> 53:57.597
Yeah, yeah. You're right, man.

53:58.497 --> 53:59.960
I need to be more.

53:59.962 --> 54:01.897
What the fuck is that, anyway?

54:04.529 --> 54:05.830
That.

54:07.996 --> 54:09.663
That's a freezer.

56:55.895 --> 56:57.963
What the fuck?

56:58.896 --> 57:00.964
I need one as soon as possible.

57:01.896 --> 57:05.427
Yeah, um, preferably today.

57:05.429 --> 57:08.029
Yeah. No, sorry, it's
an emergency, you see?

57:09.464 --> 57:10.964
One second.

57:13.364 --> 57:14.760
All right, Gerry, mate.

57:14.762 --> 57:16.295
Look, I can't really talk right now, man.

57:16.297 --> 57:17.564
I'm a bit busy.

57:21.563 --> 57:22.995
What?

57:22.997 --> 57:24.560
Hold on a minute.

57:24.562 --> 57:25.961
What are you talking about?

57:25.963 --> 57:27.964
I sent you the full schedule yesterday.

57:30.397 --> 57:33.498
Warning? You're gonna give me a warning?

57:34.563 --> 57:36.395
No, cool. No, it's fine, Gerry.

57:36.397 --> 57:38.362
It's all right. Go on,
give me a warning, innit?

57:38.364 --> 57:39.827
'Cause I let you know, yeah?

57:39.829 --> 57:42.694
That warning ain't gonna be
as bad as chemotherapy, is it?

57:42.696 --> 57:44.694
No, and just in case you wondered

57:44.696 --> 57:47.362
it's terminal as well.

57:47.364 --> 57:50.261
So, sorry if I got some other
things on my mind, mate, yeah?

57:50.263 --> 57:51.664
Fucking prick.

58:03.662 --> 58:05.760
A million and 50.

58:05.762 --> 58:07.295
A million and 10.

58:07.297 --> 58:08.563
A million and 20.

58:09.962 --> 58:11.294
Gerry.

58:11.296 --> 58:12.897
What are you doing here?

58:14.997 --> 58:17.264
What is that?

58:19.729 --> 58:21.264
It's a cock.

58:22.562 --> 58:25.262
- It is disgusting.
- Yeah, I know.

58:25.264 --> 58:27.960
- Are you sure it's not yours?
- It's not mine.

58:27.962 --> 58:29.694
But why are you looking at me like that?

58:29.696 --> 58:31.594
It certainly ain't mine.

58:31.596 --> 58:32.964
Have you seen it?

58:33.663 --> 58:35.361
It's white.

58:35.363 --> 58:36.495
Whose cock is it then?

58:36.497 --> 58:38.460
How the fuck am I meant
to know whose cock that is?

58:38.462 --> 58:40.361
It was sent from your phone. They all were.

58:40.363 --> 58:42.263
Well, my phone must have got nicked then.

58:42.962 --> 58:44.693
I spoke to you this morning.

58:44.695 --> 58:46.561
Yeah, and it must have
been in the afternoon.

58:46.563 --> 58:48.660
After I came out of the doctor's.

58:48.662 --> 58:50.995
That's it. My phone got
nicked in the afternoon,

58:50.997 --> 58:52.593
and they got sent.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.264
Why? When... when were they sent to you?

58:55.030 --> 58:57.361
- This afternoon.
- Hah! There we go.

58:57.363 --> 58:58.893
Makes sense, don't it?

59:04.329 --> 59:05.995
Oh dear. What is that?

59:09.329 --> 59:10.894
Look, Gerry, man...

59:10.896 --> 59:13.763
- I swear, I didn't mean to lie.
- Save it.

59:14.629 --> 59:15.994
You're fired.

59:15.996 --> 59:17.461
Effective immediately.

59:17.463 --> 59:19.494
- No, you can't do that.
- I just did.

01:01:11.263 --> 01:01:12.761
You better not be lying this time,

01:01:12.763 --> 01:01:14.960
or I swear to God.

01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:16.494
Yeah, well, of course I'm gonna ask you.

01:01:16.496 --> 01:01:18.597
You're the only person who
had access to my wallet.

01:01:19.296 --> 01:01:20.360
So it wasn't you

01:01:20.362 --> 01:01:21.727
who ordered this massive freezer

01:01:21.729 --> 01:01:23.696
that just sitting in my
living room right now?

01:01:24.729 --> 01:01:26.526
So, Mr. Hussein,

01:01:26.528 --> 01:01:28.894
new lock, bolts, and chain.

01:01:28.896 --> 01:01:31.029
You can't really do much more than that.

01:01:32.296 --> 01:01:34.729
Safe as houses, as they say.

01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:46.460
Go on, then.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:47.964
Sh-show your face.

01:02:49.762 --> 01:02:51.829
Fucking prick.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.930
What the fuck?

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:02.493
"According to the law in London,"

01:04:02.495 --> 01:04:04.660
you may sit down for the night,

01:04:04.662 --> 01:04:07.294
but the police must move you on

01:04:07.296 --> 01:04:08.997
"if they see you asleep."

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.863
Hey, how's it going?

01:04:24.562 --> 01:04:26.029
My friends.

01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:08.896
Yes, Mum, I've eaten.

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.597
I had, like, a pepperoni pizza before.

01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:15.761
No.

01:05:15.763 --> 01:05:17.530
I don't know whose it is.

01:05:18.363 --> 01:05:20.761
I'm being serious.

01:05:20.763 --> 01:05:24.597
Wh... Why are you asking me anyway?
Like you haven't seen my willy before.

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:28.427
No.

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:31.730
Th-That's not me trying
to show you that I'm gay.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:34.629
Mum.

01:05:35.328 --> 01:05:36.426
It...

01:05:36.428 --> 01:05:38.596
The willy was not even circumcised.

01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:44.761
So why... I don't understand why
you would even think it's mine.

01:05:44.763 --> 01:05:46.230
Have you seen the color of it?

01:05:48.295 --> 01:05:50.196
It looks like a fucking fish finger.

01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:24.096
I guess it's just us guys now, innit?

01:06:26.563 --> 01:06:28.629
Guess we gotta look after each other.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:13.029
You fucking idiot.

01:08:28.962 --> 01:08:31.497
Never a lender or borrower be!

01:08:32.395 --> 01:08:34.029
You used to say it all the time.

01:08:35.929 --> 01:08:38.095
Look, I know we're a working family,

01:08:38.828 --> 01:08:40.727
and...

01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:42.627
this isn't me trying to get you and Dad

01:08:42.629 --> 01:08:43.693
to pay for my mortgage.

01:08:43.694 --> 01:08:44.997
That's not what I'm asking.

01:08:45.894 --> 01:08:49.460
I just wanted to see if he was able

01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:52.096
to lend me a couple hundred
quid until the end of...

01:08:56.328 --> 01:08:58.393
No, I know.

01:08:58.395 --> 01:09:00.596
There is not a lot out there, Mum, but...

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.026
I'm gonna try it.

01:09:03.028 --> 01:09:04.627
I hope to find one.

01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:06.162
Pretty confident I can.

01:09:09.428 --> 01:09:12.426
Just gotta look up at the
stars and not down at my feet,

01:09:12.429 --> 01:09:13.763
I guess.

01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:18.529
What's the matter
with you? Can't say hello?

01:09:25.263 --> 01:09:27.162
What the bumboclaat?

01:09:28.996 --> 01:09:31.029
Holy shit!

01:09:36.928 --> 01:09:39.064
Bruv, what's going on? What's the matter?

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:48.359
Are you all right, bruv?

01:09:48.362 --> 01:09:50.127
Looks like a fucking crack den in here.

01:09:51.662 --> 01:09:52.959
Bruv...

01:09:52.961 --> 01:09:55.797
just give me my weed and fuck off, innit?

01:09:58.329 --> 01:09:59.830
Oh, so, it's like that, yeah?

01:10:05.395 --> 01:10:07.530
You know what, take
your fucking weed, yeah?

01:10:39.029 --> 01:10:40.326
Hola!

01:10:40.328 --> 01:10:42.293
Holy fuck!

01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:44.393
What the fuck? What are
you doing in my house?

01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:45.660
Fuck you!

01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:47.426
You didn't give me anywhere else to go.

01:10:47.428 --> 01:10:48.461
Who the fuck are you?

01:10:48.463 --> 01:10:50.494
Mister Flash Bastard!

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.293
Mister Wheeler Dealer!

01:10:52.295 --> 01:10:53.927
Fucking crazy-boy!

01:10:53.929 --> 01:10:55.497
Get out of my fucking house!

01:10:56.562 --> 01:10:59.063
Come on. Make your fucking move!

01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:03.628
I'll snap your fucking neck.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:04.960
Oh, please, man, please.

01:11:04.962 --> 01:11:07.262
We can sort something out.
We don't have to do this.

01:11:08.362 --> 01:11:10.262
I got some cash. I can give you some money.

01:11:11.296 --> 01:11:13.394
Money. Of course.

01:11:13.396 --> 01:11:15.663
Money? Fuck you!

01:11:16.363 --> 01:11:17.630
Sit down!

01:11:28.629 --> 01:11:31.697
Probably don't remember my girlfriend.

01:11:34.462 --> 01:11:36.293
Well...

01:11:36.295 --> 01:11:37.730
she lost her baby.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.096
She lost the baby, anyway.

01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:47.028
And I lost her.

01:11:48.028 --> 01:11:49.629
Court.

01:11:52.961 --> 01:11:55.962
I lost both, both of them.

01:12:00.828 --> 01:12:03.028
They do say it's stressful...

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:06.962
losing your home.

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.730
Man, I was just doing my job.

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:19.026
They tell us to do that stuff.

01:12:19.028 --> 01:12:21.727
Wait it out for the highest offer.

01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:23.996
'Cause I'm a victim of it
just as much as you are.

01:12:32.828 --> 01:12:35.260
H-Hey now, come on.

01:12:35.262 --> 01:12:37.162

Hello, Mum.

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.492
Yeah, listen to me, yeah?
Listen to me carefully.

01:15:11.494 --> 01:15:12.692
I need your help.

01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:14.360
Can you get Imran please?

01:15:14.362 --> 01:15:17.028
Tell him to come to my house... ASAP.

01:15:17.795 --> 01:15:20.196
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

01:15:22.263 --> 01:15:23.926
I-I'm...

01:15:23.928 --> 01:15:26.592
Basically, some old, crazy man

01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:28.496
has stuck me in a freezer.

01:15:30.029 --> 01:15:32.530
It's in the hallway. Why
does that even matter?

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:35.696
Yeah, can you just tell him to come quick.

01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:40.026
Yeah, I'll explain more la...

01:15:40.028 --> 01:15:41.728
No.

01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:45.229
This has not got nothing to do with sex.

01:15:46.695 --> 01:15:48.029
Yes, Mum.

01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:51.027
Hello? Hello?

01:15:51.029 --> 01:15:53.562
Mum? Mum?

01:15:54.395 --> 01:15:55.762
Mum?

01:16:50.461 --> 01:16:52.261
As far back as I can remember,

01:16:52.263 --> 01:16:54.230
I always wanted to be an estate agent.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.993
All right, calm down.

01:16:57.995 --> 01:16:59.526
That was a little lie.

01:16:59.528 --> 01:17:01.426
A fake statement.

01:17:01.428 --> 01:17:03.727
I got no qualifications, no experience,

01:17:03.729 --> 01:17:06.460
no license, nor training.

01:17:06.462 --> 01:17:08.626
I answered an ad in a job site saying.

01:17:08.628 --> 01:17:12.360
"Spineless and love negotiating?"

01:17:12.362 --> 01:17:13.459
At least I'm not like them.

01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:15.425
"Home Under the Hammer" spanners.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.692
Once the property is completed, I advise

01:17:17.694 --> 01:17:21.425
shut the fuck up, you bunch of wankers.

01:17:21.427 --> 01:17:24.993
I spray a can of Brut over
my 60 percent polyester suit.

01:17:24.995 --> 01:17:26.627
I spit shine my shoes.

01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:30.692
"Yes, Mrs. Brown. I'll
meet you outside at noon."

01:17:30.694 --> 01:17:32.592
See, to my face, people call me Hussein.

01:17:32.594 --> 01:17:36.026
Behind my back, "Saddam, pak rat, Taliban."

01:17:36.028 --> 01:17:38.262
Some even think Gandhi's my name.

01:17:38.995 --> 01:17:40.927
I know I'm not Indian.

01:17:40.929 --> 01:17:42.194
But we're still all the same.

01:17:42.196 --> 01:17:46.561
This race-based hate can raise
the strain and take the piss.

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.727
You think I'm a cabbie?

01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:50.993
A corner shop Ali, serving curry?

01:17:52.828 --> 01:17:56.293
As if. I'm an estate agent. A great agent.

01:17:56.294 --> 01:17:59.892
I make payments. And if there's a
new space vacant, I'm chain breaking.

01:17:59.895 --> 01:18:04.393
I could give a fuck if I sold
you a lame, stained basement.

01:18:04.395 --> 01:18:06.926
I mean, you viewed it, right?

01:18:08.794 --> 01:18:12.195
I remember this one
story about this one don.

01:18:12.961 --> 01:18:14.993
I think his name was John.

01:18:14.995 --> 01:18:17.827
He put a house on the offer, for a mansion.

01:18:17.829 --> 01:18:20.459
Oh! I thought the lot was on.

01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:22.460
But my commission was rotten.

01:18:22.462 --> 01:18:24.793
He wanted this place so bad.

01:18:24.795 --> 01:18:26.993
I decided to bend and break.

01:18:26.995 --> 01:18:29.793
"Yeah, mate, I'll ring the
vendor, and I'll negotiate."

01:18:29.795 --> 01:18:32.292
That's how I fucked him over.

01:18:32.294 --> 01:18:34.493
And that's the money
that paid for my holiday.

01:18:34.495 --> 01:18:37.927
So what if a client
outbid himself in the end?

01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:40.460
We're not relatives, acquaintances,

01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:41.995
or personal friends.

01:18:42.694 --> 01:18:44.525
The more you zoom in...

01:18:44.527 --> 01:18:45.859
the less we all count.

01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:48.792
It's like we're all
rats, ants, and parasites.

01:18:48.794 --> 01:18:50.259
All crawling around.

01:18:50.261 --> 01:18:52.360
It's a vicious cycle.

01:18:52.362 --> 01:18:54.460
We signed our lives to a trap.

01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:56.529
They say, karma can't harm ya...

01:18:57.262 --> 01:18:58.791
if it can't catch up.

01:18:58.794 --> 01:19:01.629
So run fast towards the darkness

01:19:02.361 --> 01:19:05.629
in hope... not trust.
