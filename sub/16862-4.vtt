00:00.959 --> 00:02.544
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue me...

00:02.544 --> 00:04.879
I'm tired of living
with two retarded people.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.132
One mentally,
the other emotionally.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.341
I mean, do you...

00:08.466 --> 00:10.844
Do you put any thought at all
into this relationship?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.345
More than you know.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.472
You think Tommy
will have to go to jail?

00:14.472 --> 00:16.975
I don't know. I don't think so.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.810
You love him, don't you?

00:18.935 --> 00:21.938
That's okay, because he's like a legend
at our house, you know?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.774
Everybody tells stories
about his saves, and...

00:24.941 --> 00:26.901
Yeah, he's a real heroic
son of a bitch.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.320
<i>Dispatch, dispatch,
13, officer down.</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:31.197
<i>Dispatch, officer down,
we need an ambulance.</i>

00:31.614 --> 00:33.283
Johnny's dead.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.368
Still think of him at times.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.787
Every goddamned day, I think of him.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.789
We all do.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.791
Please, Mr. Gavin.
Just let me explain.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.918
Explain?
How you kidnapped my daughter?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.504
Let me ask you something.
Does that nose ring hurt?

00:46.629 --> 00:48.131
- No.
- No? That's interesting.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.300
Um...

00:50.300 --> 00:52.594
I told your mother I was bringing
you home. Let's go.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.679
No. I can't live
with your shit anymore.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.931
I'm legal, and I'm staying here

00:56.931 --> 00:59.601
with somebody who loves me
and who treats me with respect.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
I'm getting that kid.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.188
And if you try to
steal him away from me,

01:03.313 --> 01:06.483
I'll use any piece of dirt
I can dig up on you,

01:06.608 --> 01:10.445
or Gavin, or anyone else
in your lowlife goddamn house. Anything.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.906
I've gotta...
I'm supposed to be in by 11.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.825
I have an 11:00, um...

01:15.992 --> 01:18.578
What... What are you...

01:20.580 --> 01:21.915
Wow, that's fast.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.042
Get out of my truck.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.169
Look, I got some cash.
It's not much,

01:26.169 --> 01:27.504
but we could
grease somebody's palm.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.005
Jerry, stop.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.340
Time to hang it up.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.342
- So that's it?
- Yeah, pretty much.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.677
Five days a week
down at headquarters.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.346
Put away a couple of bucks.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.014
Maybe move down
to Hilton Head

01:38.014 --> 01:40.058
and spend the rest
of my days working on my handicap.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.684
Michael?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.229
Your mom...

01:44.521 --> 01:45.814
She's passed.

02:01.746 --> 02:02.997
Jerry.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.999
Come on, let's go!

02:07.710 --> 02:11.840
<i>Let's sing a song of long ago</i>

02:12.048 --> 02:14.509
<i>When things were green</i>

02:14.509 --> 02:18.096
<i>And movin' slow</i>

02:18.429 --> 02:19.764
Jerry!

02:19.889 --> 02:23.518
<i>And people'd stop
To say hello</i>

02:23.726 --> 02:26.229
<i>Or they'd say hi to you</i>

02:26.729 --> 02:29.107
Jerry, let's go.

02:30.066 --> 02:34.028
<i>Would you like
To come over for tea</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:41.578
<i>With the missus and me?</i>

02:41.911 --> 02:45.456
<i>It's a real nice way
To spend a day</i>

02:45.456 --> 02:47.167
<i>In Dayton, Ohio</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:50.211
<i>On a lazy Sunday afternoon</i>

02:50.211 --> 02:53.464
<i>In 1903</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:57.760
<i>Let's sing a song
Of long ago</i>

02:58.219 --> 03:01.639
<i>When things could grow</i>

03:01.639 --> 03:06.186
<i>And days flowed quietly</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:10.690
<i>The air was clean
And you could see</i>

03:10.690 --> 03:13.568
<i>And folks were nice to you</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:20.575
<i>Would you like
to come over for tea</i>

03:23.494 --> 03:26.039
<i>With the missus and me?</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:31.586
<i>It's a real nice way
To spend a day</i>

03:31.586 --> 03:34.297
<i>In Dayton, Ohio</i>

03:34.422 --> 03:37.508
<i>On a lazy Sunday afternoon</i>

03:37.508 --> 03:42.847
<i>In 1903</i>

03:56.110 --> 03:57.362
Oh, crazy shit, man.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.863
Yeah, Jesus.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.199
Yo, Tommy. Did you call
his son, Peter?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.369
Yeah. He's gonna come back
from the honeymoon

04:04.369 --> 04:06.579
and be here
the day after tomorrow.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.581
He said to go ahead
with the cremation,

04:08.581 --> 04:10.583
and just to do whatever
with the ashes.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.669
You tell him the truth,
what happened?

04:12.794 --> 04:13.920
No, I mean, what's the point?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.797
If the department
starts sniffing around,

04:15.797 --> 04:17.924
I don't want him to know
the details, you know?

04:17.924 --> 04:20.510
I mean he's gonna get
the benefits, you know?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.220
- True.
- Doesn't make any sense.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.973
Jesus Christ, Jerry. Shit.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.224
There's no other way?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.558
You just don't get it, Franco.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.978
Yeah, no.
You're damn right we don't, Lou.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.854
Come on. You know why?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.440
Because you're young
and the future is your friend.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.318
You know, and your eyes work,
and your cocks work,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.696
and the way you think you're
gonna be on the job forever.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.698
Eating, smoking.
It don't work that way, boys.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.617
Okay, so if I get a little older,
a little sick, I should kill myself?

04:44.617 --> 04:45.910
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.662
You know what?
It was Jerry's life.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.163
And he was unhappy,
and he made a choice

04:49.163 --> 04:51.416
and obviously it was
a pretty severe choice,

04:51.416 --> 04:52.875
but you wanna know something?

04:52.875 --> 04:54.544
I give the guy all the respect I have

04:54.669 --> 04:56.045
for going out on his own terms.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.422
Yeah, well, I don't.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.090
He was a damn coward.
Watch it, Franco.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.466
I'm just saying how I feel, Lou.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.469
- You hear this shit?
- Yeah.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.263
I think I kinda agree with him.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.347
Well, then, screw you too.

05:06.347 --> 05:10.018
No. He was a coward.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.686
Watch it, Tom, okay?

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897
He was afraid.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.649
He was afraid of working
behind that desk

05:16.774 --> 05:18.693
down at headquarters
for the next five or--

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
Come on, Tom!
That's your excuse for the guy?

05:20.695 --> 05:23.072
He was afraid?
Shut up, asshole!

05:23.072 --> 05:25.283
What do you got,
eight years on the job?

05:25.283 --> 05:26.951
- No, I was--
- Shut up!

05:26.951 --> 05:29.329
Christ almighty.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.831
You know how much he hated
being the chief? Huh?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.916
Watching us run into jobs
while he stood outside?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.419
But he did it, you know why?
So he could teach assholes

05:36.544 --> 05:38.171
like you and you
what the job was about.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.006
When he was working
up in the Bronx,

05:40.006 --> 05:41.132
when the Bronx was burning,

05:41.132 --> 05:42.800
you ever hear
about those days, huh?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.887
They'd get 10, 12,
14 jobs a night!

05:45.887 --> 05:47.597
Shithead.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.932
He ran into a job one time
up on 279th Street.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.435
Pulled three kids in wheelchairs
out in 15 minutes.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.896
You know why? 'Cause the rest
of his crew was busy

05:54.896 --> 05:56.898
bringing old people out.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
There was a cold storage
warehouse fire one time

05:59.150 --> 06:02.403
up there, and, uh, the chief
on the job that night

06:02.403 --> 06:04.697
shot the job down 'cause
it was too hot for humans.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.823
You know what Jerry did?

06:05.823 --> 06:08.159
He went around the side,

06:08.159 --> 06:10.286
went in a side door,
pulled out two drunken assholes.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.872
Ends up the two same assholes
who started the goddamn fire,

06:12.872 --> 06:15.208
and he was working then
without a mask.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.501
Running in and out
of the building

06:16.501 --> 06:19.170
with a cigar
dangling out of his mouth.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.881
You wanna talk
about being brave,

06:21.881 --> 06:24.008
and who's a coward
and who's not a coward?

06:24.008 --> 06:25.134
Suck my cock.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.723
You wanna talk about--

06:33.935 --> 06:35.144
Being brave.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.188
Doing that work
up in the Bronx,

06:37.188 --> 06:39.315
he used up all
the goddamn brave he had.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.245
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:52.245 --> 06:55.456
<i>With these ropes tied tight
Can we do no wrong?</i>

06:55.706 --> 06:58.251
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

06:58.376 --> 07:01.671
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:05.091
<i>When my teeth bite down
I can see the blood</i>

07:05.216 --> 07:07.885
<i>Of a thousand men
Who have come and gone</i>

07:07.885 --> 07:11.639
<i>Now we grieve
'Cause now it's gone</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:14.267
<i>Things were good
When we were young</i>

07:14.392 --> 07:17.937
<i>Is it safe to stay?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

07:18.062 --> 07:21.023
<i>Was it right to leave?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

07:21.023 --> 07:24.694
<i>Will I ever learn?
C'mon, c'mon</i>

07:24.694 --> 07:27.780
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

07:33.786 --> 07:34.787
Engine trouble?

07:34.912 --> 07:36.789
Ow, oh! Hey.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.416
Hey. You okay there, sweetheart?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.126
Yeah, I just--
It won't turn over.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.253
I think it's the carburetor.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.839
Uh, yeah, no,
it's not the carburetor.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.424
Uh, I'm pretty sure
it's the carburetor.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.509
Yeah, no, there's no carburetor

07:48.634 --> 07:51.053
in this car.
It's fuel injected.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.183
Give me a second.
I'll go get my code reader.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.934
Hm, code--?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.811
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.022
- What's going on? You fix it?
- Um, almost. Uh...

08:01.022 --> 08:02.899
Yeah, was it the carburetor?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.775
Carburetor. It doesn't
have a carburetor.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.694
- It's fuel injected.
- Really.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.447
Well, listen, Mr. Goodwrench,
Jimmy the Jew

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
witnessed your little
father-knows-best routine

08:11.741 --> 08:13.367
- with Colleen the other night.
- Yeah?

08:13.367 --> 08:15.786
That's gonna seriously hamper us
getting a black probie.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.456
Wh-- What am I supposed to do?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.249
Something, otherwise you're
playing basketball,

08:20.249 --> 08:21.792
and that's something
I don't wanna see.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.294
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.463
Outta my way boys.
It'll take me two seconds.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.381
Did you guys take
my code reader outta my locker?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.550
'Cause that's
the last place I saw it.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.052
- Code reader.
- Yep.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.470
Hey, let me give you
a hand with that.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.389
Um, wow, this is a lot
different than mine.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.599
Mine's, um--

08:36.599 --> 08:38.226
Not real?

08:38.226 --> 08:41.604
No, I-I don't wanna get
in your way.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.272
It's your machine, so...

08:43.272 --> 08:44.941
Wow. That's awesome. Thanks.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.692
I know how I am
with my code reader.

08:46.817 --> 08:47.902
Right, yeah.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.445
All right, so I decided

08:49.445 --> 08:51.864
I'm gonna give you
another chance,

08:51.864 --> 08:55.117
since you were so thoroughly
pussified the other night

08:55.243 --> 08:56.953
on our first date.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.538
- Pussified?
- Yeah.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
He had to be in by 11.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.125
And then, I went to kiss him
and he just kept talking

09:03.125 --> 09:04.418
through the kiss,

09:04.418 --> 09:07.046
and I-- I've actually never
had-- Had that happen before.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.298
I was talking before
you came in for the kiss.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.509
You were on your way in
and I was, like, mid-sentence

09:11.509 --> 09:13.010
and that's when
you made contact.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.971
You must have had something
important to say.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.931
I-- We had a discussion
going on--

09:16.931 --> 09:18.975
Unless you were talking
about a cure for cancer,

09:18.975 --> 09:20.768
- you're gonna lose.
- Yeah.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.728
All right, fellas,
promise me something,

09:22.728 --> 09:25.856
if he misses the date
that I'm about to offer him,

09:25.856 --> 09:27.942
please bust
his balls forever.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.654
If he misses the date,
it's ball-busting bonanza.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.532
- Just like I thought.
- What?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.118
- You have a pinched vacuum line.
- Oh, you know, I--

09:37.118 --> 09:39.161
These are--
These are so pretty.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.122
I thought it was pinched.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.586
Okay.
That's nice.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.380
- All right, well, turn it over.
- All right.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.051
Ah, very nice.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.053
Very impressive.
Nice work.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.972
He actually thought this thing
had a carburetor.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.224
Heh, carburetor,
what an asshole.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.059
- What?
- What?

10:02.059 --> 10:04.228
All right, so we're on,
right, for tonight?

10:04.353 --> 10:05.605
- Yeah.
- No excuses.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.357
- No.
- Right? I'm picking you up?

10:09.734 --> 10:10.776
See you, princess.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.154
- Okay. All right.
- Dressed up.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.238
Okay.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.786
What's it gonna take to keep
the princess thing quiet?

10:24.540 --> 10:25.791
Hey.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.337
Don't you start.
Listen to me.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.297
Do you know what you're doing
to your mother? Huh?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.799
Do you have any idea? Huh?
Not to mention me.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.427
And your baby sister who you're
setting a horrible example for.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.553
- Dad, stop.
- Stop what?

10:37.762 --> 10:38.846
I came here to talk to you.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.848
- I'm not gonna stop.
- You're making it worse.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.850
I'm making it worse?
How much worse can it get? Huh?

10:42.850 --> 10:43.934
- Dad--
- What?

10:43.934 --> 10:47.313
- I'm in love with him!
- Ah, you're in love with him.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.023
Do you want to talk or what?

10:49.023 --> 10:51.025
Well, what am I supposed
to do here?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.361
Buy us something.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.947
So you're blackmailing me.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.116
Hey, you know what?
Stop just lecturing me

10:59.116 --> 11:01.285
and do something practical.
We need a lot of stuff.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.329
Tony's in a band,
he doesn't make a lot of money.

11:04.038 --> 11:08.167
I'll buy you a-a couple
of lamps and you call me

11:08.167 --> 11:10.544
and your mother
every two or three days.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.214
Yeah, okay, that'll cost you
a couple more than lamps.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.591
Just... gotta buy us a bed too.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.387
I'll buy you two lamps
and a--

11:20.930 --> 11:24.850
And a bed and you call me
and your mother

11:24.975 --> 11:26.852
every two or three days.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.855
Deal.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.985
What the hell is on the back
of your pants?

11:42.284 --> 11:45.287
Well, that... was fun.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.081
Mm, yeah.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.837
You know, I'm more of a darts guy,
really, than a pool guy.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.005
Probably explains the, uh,
ass beating you gave me

11:55.005 --> 11:57.383
on the pool table.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.845
I mean, not that I, you know--
I'm-- I can--

12:01.971 --> 12:03.180
Yeah?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.015
Handle myself. Hey, oh.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.851
Hm, wow. We didn't, um--

12:06.851 --> 12:08.352
Stop talking.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.563
No, I ju-just wanted
to say how soft your--

12:10.688 --> 12:12.648
- Stop.
- Jeans.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.070
Mm. Mm.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.448
Mm! Yeah. Ah.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.992
Mmm. Mm-hm.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.869
Um, heh.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.663
Whew. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.081
This working for you?

12:29.081 --> 12:31.876
Yeah. Mm.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.461
Mm.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.545
You sure about that?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.213
Yeah, yeah.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.471
What?

12:43.721 --> 12:44.930
No, it's not.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.309
No, it's just gonna take
a couple more minutes, that's all.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.187
No, it's not.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.897
No--

12:54.815 --> 12:56.859
You're sure that you, uh--

12:57.318 --> 12:59.069
You pulled me
outta that fire, right?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.905
No.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.532
- Really?
- Yeah, it was-- It was four of us.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.452
We dragged you out and, uh, actually,

13:06.452 --> 13:10.414
- I didn't even do anything.
- Really.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.417
Yeah, and then I yelled dibs
to give you mouth to mouth

13:13.417 --> 13:15.085
because your lips
are just so luscious,

13:15.211 --> 13:17.046
and you're just so hot.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.214
Uh-huh.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.924
You hard yet?

13:19.924 --> 13:22.134
No, because I-I think
you're lying to me.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.594
- Yeah.
- You were lying to me.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.054
- Yeah.
- I knew it. What?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.222
Zip up, get out.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.224
- Should I call you?
- No!

13:28.224 --> 13:29.934
Just-- Just go.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.320
- How's it going?
- Just another wonderful day

13:41.445 --> 13:43.405
joined at the hip
with the screamer.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.491
Come, come, come.
Oop. Oop.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
Hey.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.329
Oh, my God,
why does he do that?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.623
I don't know.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.959
I was expecting you
home hours ago.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.796
Yeah, I, uh--
I stopped to talk to Colleen.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.965
- You did?
- Yeah.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.926
No, I just--
I don't know.

14:03.926 --> 14:07.721
I thought I-I'd stop by
and have a conversation,

14:07.721 --> 14:10.766
and I ended up
buying my way

14:10.766 --> 14:14.311
back into a semi-relationship.

14:14.603 --> 14:18.399
Yeah, I made a purchase
for her and nose-ring boy,

14:19.108 --> 14:23.237
but she did end up
talking to me,

14:23.571 --> 14:27.449
so still thinking
that she's my, uh, little girl,

14:27.449 --> 14:29.493
which, of course,
I know she's not, but...

14:32.121 --> 14:35.541
Oh, I know.
I know what you mean.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.128
Um, you hungry?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.546
I could eat.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.674
Okay, I have some, uh,
leftover lasagna.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.469
What's going on?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.014
- Daddy.
- What'd you do?

14:50.139 --> 14:51.599
I cut myself.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.183
Okay, let me see.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.020
All right,
what were you doing?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.813
I was cutting some
construction paper.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.065
With the big-girl
scissors, right?

15:00.232 --> 15:01.817
Well, yeah.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.863
Honey, I know that
you're a big girl,

15:05.863 --> 15:07.573
but what did I say?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.075
Even big girls sometimes use
the little-girl scissors

15:10.075 --> 15:12.703
because they're just
not as sharp, right?

15:13.037 --> 15:14.496
Here.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.415
All fixed.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.083
You forgot something.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.418
What?

15:21.045 --> 15:23.047
Okay.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.049
Thank you, Daddy.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.342
All right.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.053
Your food's ready. Come sit.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.763
Oh, ah.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.143
At least I can

15:36.769 --> 15:39.897
still kiss a boo-boo away.

15:40.689 --> 15:46.070
Time I didn't know
that I still had,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.197
but apparently I do.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.413
What?

15:57.164 --> 15:59.625
I think that it's really sweet
that you went to see Colleen.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.126
You made that effort.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.795
Oh, well, you know, I--

16:02.920 --> 16:04.755
You're a good dad.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.257
I'm-- I'm all right.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.259
Mm-hm.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.430
Okay, I'm just gonna--

16:13.430 --> 16:14.974
I'm gonna say it
and put it out there.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.267
Okay, you can laugh, whatever.

16:17.267 --> 16:23.148
But, um, for Katy's sake,
and for his sake,

16:23.273 --> 16:24.858
maybe we should try again.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.780
How--? How would we, um...

16:31.532 --> 16:33.784
I don't know. I mean,
maybe we could see someone,

16:33.784 --> 16:37.246
a therapist,
and get them to assess our relationship

16:37.246 --> 16:40.332
and see if it makes any sense
for us starting again.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.545
Um, you know,
I mean, if--

16:44.795 --> 16:48.590
- I'm willing to try it.
- Okay. Let's do it.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.271
What?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.190
What?

17:05.983 --> 17:08.944
I... It's just that...

17:09.820 --> 17:12.823
...little exchange kinda...

17:12.823 --> 17:15.826
got the, uh, engine running.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.954
We have kids in the room.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.875
Right. Right, okay.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.639
Oh, where am I?
What's that?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.807
Oh, this?
A bottle of vodka.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.476
Found it sitting
behind the toilet.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.935
Well, is it empty?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.896
- No.
- Then leave it there.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.190
The next time I'm on the can
and I want a drink,

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
I don't want to have
to reach back and come up empty.

17:48.859 --> 17:52.071
Ugh! Oh, my head.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.822
Uh.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.449
What's your problem?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.659
You came home blitzed
outta your mind last night

17:57.868 --> 18:00.954
and I had a nice dinner
ready for us, and you pass out, okay?

18:00.954 --> 18:03.791
You think, maybe,
you're drinking a little too much, Maggie?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.375
Am I drinking right now?

18:05.375 --> 18:07.294
- No.
- Then that answers that.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.631
And don't move my babies, Sean.
There are others?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.258
Yeah, there's one under my side
of the bed for after sex.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.094
There's one
in the computer drawer

18:15.219 --> 18:16.678
for when I'm on the computer.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.680
And there's--

18:19.681 --> 18:22.267
There's one right here
for when I'm watching TV.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.519
You know what?

18:23.519 --> 18:26.188
I'm really tired of being married
to an alcoholic, okay?

18:26.188 --> 18:27.856
You need help. You're a drunk.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.068
And you're an idiot,
but I don't rake you over coals for it.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.862
My being an idiot
is not a choice.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.073
Neither is my being a drunk.
It's genetic.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.367
If it bothers you,
talk to my father.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.160
I want a divorce.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.079
Things have gotta change,
or I want a divorce.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.164
I am so sick and tired of you

18:44.164 --> 18:45.916
living in some drunken
parallel universe

18:46.041 --> 18:47.918
while I'm back here
on planet Earth

18:48.043 --> 18:49.253
trying to make
this marriage work.

18:49.378 --> 18:53.090
You want a divorce?
I'll give you a divorce.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.926
It's the least I can do
for all the trouble, Sean.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.470
- You got yourself a divorce.
- No, no, no, wait.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.265
I had a whole speech planned.
I was just getting started.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.433
Parallel universe,
blah, blah, blah,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.269
planet Earth,
I mean, it takes--

19:05.269 --> 19:07.688
You know, it takes two
to tango, Maggie.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.773
- Is that a crib sheet, Sean?
- Yeah.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.110
This relationship
is never gonna work. I'm done.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.112
I'll have my cousin Eddie
draw up the papers.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.740
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go vomit. Uh.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.201
What, uh, vomiting,
next on my list, by the way.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.286
Vomiting.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.502
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.837
- Surprise!
- Hey.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.006
- Surprise.
- What's going on?

19:34.131 --> 19:36.842
- Got you a little baby gift.
- Oh, cool.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.218
Yeah. Um,
did Eddie call you?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.012
I didn't check
my cell phone, why?

19:40.137 --> 19:42.806
Then I am also
the bearer of good news.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.725
Um, the insurance company
is settling.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.976
Oh, really? Wow.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.519
Yeah, they're gonna
cut us a check.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.479
And we are also
off the hook

19:49.730 --> 19:51.857
in terms of that whole, uh,
going to jail and shit.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.568
- That's awesome. That's great.
- I know!

19:54.735 --> 19:56.987
Great. Well, thanks.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.326
- Is it safe?
- It's not really.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.827
Janet just ran
to the store for--

20:03.952 --> 20:05.621
She's gonna be back
in five minutes--

20:05.621 --> 20:07.748
- I just wanna look at him!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

20:07.748 --> 20:09.082
You remember Troy! Troy.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.919
Oh! Sorry.
Hey, how you doing?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.212
- Great.
- Yeah?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.047
- Cool jeans.
- What?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.007
- Cool jeans.
- Yeah.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.344
- Great.
- Be careful, please.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.809
Oh, my God.
He's so gorgeous.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.354
He's the most gorgeous little thing.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.855
Oh, look at that.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.399
Give me that.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.194
- Are those G-Star? G-Star?
- What?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.904
The jeans. G-Star?

20:39.029 --> 20:40.572
I don't know,
my wife gets 'em for me.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.116
- Oh, yep.
- Yeah, cute, right?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.160
He's so cute!

20:45.160 --> 20:47.579
Yeah, I-I-- Really, I gotta
get him back down for his nap.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.206
Well, no, no, no, no.
He just woke up.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.874
No, but he-he-he takes
two naps.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.377
One right after the other.
It's-- You ask any doctors

20:53.377 --> 20:55.754
it's a big thing now.
It's called double napping.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.048
The first nap is like "nap-nap"

20:58.048 --> 21:00.592
and the second one's
like a power nap.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.053
So come--
Come on, give him to me.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.763
Got, uh, something to drink?

21:04.888 --> 21:06.390
No, that's what my wife
went to the store--

21:06.515 --> 21:07.891
Oh, that's fine.
I'll have water.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.977
Water? You want water?
He wants water.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.187
Help yourself to the water.
Come on, give him...

21:12.187 --> 21:13.605
Don't, get off,
I'm fine, I--

21:13.855 --> 21:15.941
- Hey!
- Hello!

21:16.066 --> 21:17.609
Look, Sheila dropped by.

21:17.859 --> 21:22.197
This is, uh, Sheila's
new boyfriend, uh, Derrick.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.407
Derrick?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.575
- Dennis, I'm sorry. Dennis.
- Troy.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.619
- Troy. This is Troy.
- Troy.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.288
And, uh, they, uh--

21:29.413 --> 21:31.373
They brought a gift
for the baby.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.167
This is like a-- I don't know
what it is actually.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.586
So you two seem
to be getting along famously.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.214
I know. I have the baby magic.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.507
- Okay, here.
- Oh, no, no.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.217
Let me take the baby.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.261
Hold it, okay, let go
of Aunty Sheila's hair.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.096
There we go. Mm.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
He gets a little cranky
at lunch.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.185
Um, it's time
for his nap.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.812
No, he just had a nap.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.440
Yeah, no, his second nap.
His power nap. Tommy told me.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.607
No, no, I said
he was hungry.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.735
Here you go.
Here's a soda.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.737
Did you guys come up
with a name yet?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.739
No, no, not yet.
We're still working on that.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.866
- How about Derrick.
- What?

22:05.866 --> 22:07.075
Derrick, great name.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.911
That's totally weird
that you guys haven't come up with a name.

22:10.037 --> 22:13.457
I bet you think that's weird.
Here, why-- Can I just--?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.376
Let me help you.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.879
Hi, boo-boo.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.714
Honey, the, uh--
The, um,

22:20.714 --> 22:22.758
insurance company
settled the suit.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.260
- So that's good news.
- That's wonderful news, yep.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.387
- G-Star?
- What?

22:27.387 --> 22:29.973
The jeans on this guy.
G-Star?

22:29.973 --> 22:31.892
Uh, I-I don't remember.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.477
Oh.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.896
Okay, um, you know what,
let me just...

22:35.896 --> 22:37.439
Here.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.067
I'll take the baby.
Okay, oopsie, oopsie.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.943
You okay?

22:41.943 --> 22:44.488
All right, okay, thank you
so much for the good news

22:44.488 --> 22:46.698
and the gifts, and it was very
nice meeting you, Dennis.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.450
Oh, it-- Oh.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.994
- Honey, did--
- That's just--

22:51.119 --> 22:52.704
Hon.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.166
Um, that baby hates her.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.959
He has gas.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.762
So, Tommy, um...

23:09.012 --> 23:10.680
You, uh...

23:10.680 --> 23:13.016
You're kinda like
a hero to, uh, me

23:13.141 --> 23:14.267
and a lot of guys in my house.

23:14.267 --> 23:18.313
- Yeah?
- And, uh, you did, uh,

23:18.313 --> 23:20.941
a bucket leap rescue
a few years back.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.275
I've done quite a few
of them, yeah.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.820
Yeah, well this one
in particular we saved the clipping from.

23:24.945 --> 23:25.946
It's on our board

23:25.946 --> 23:27.739
- in the kitchen and everything.
- Yeah.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.783
Yeah, I was just wondering

23:29.783 --> 23:32.077
if maybe you could do me a favor
and sign it for us?

23:32.202 --> 23:34.371
- Sure.
- Thanks.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.373
Yeah, he loves you.
He talks about you--

23:36.373 --> 23:37.999
That's not--
We don't need to--

23:37.999 --> 23:40.710
Okay, let's just...

23:40.710 --> 23:42.629
What do you want it to say?

23:42.629 --> 23:45.215
Um, "To Troy."

23:46.967 --> 23:48.218
Yeah?

23:48.218 --> 23:52.431
Um, "and everybody
at Oyster Cove,

23:55.350 --> 23:58.395
your buddy, Tommy."

23:58.812 --> 24:00.230
All right.
What are you doing? Hey, hey.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.023
I just want to feel the material.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.775
- It's jeans!
- Okay, you know what?

24:03.775 --> 24:06.820
We better go because I actually forgot
to put quarters in the meter,

24:06.820 --> 24:08.947
- so we're gonna...
- Yeah, okay, whatever.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.574
Okay, come on.
Yeah, yeah.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.452
Thanks. That's great.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.833
Mikey, what the hell's
the matter with you?

24:19.833 --> 24:22.961
Mikey, you okay?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.421
Mikey?

24:24.546 --> 24:27.424
I'm a grown man and I don--

24:27.424 --> 24:29.509
I don't even know
how to use a dryer.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.929
She did everything for me,
you know, guys?

24:32.929 --> 24:35.265
And I never even thanked her.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.601
I mean, I thanked her,
you know, like I said,

24:37.601 --> 24:39.728
"Thanks, Mom,"
but they were just words.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.354
I didn't really mean it,
you know?

24:41.354 --> 24:43.273
I just said it so she'd
do it again,

24:43.273 --> 24:46.526
like make my bed,
or cook me breakfast,

24:46.526 --> 24:48.028
or pick up my clothes.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.909
Lou, you make one gay joke
and I swear...

24:53.909 --> 24:56.786
Mike, I'm not gonna make
a gay joke.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.413
What then?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.795
It's all right.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.520
I can't believe you, uh--

25:22.395 --> 25:25.357
didn't make one gay joke
during that whole little monologue.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.692
Oh, Jesus, Tom.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.279
Kid just lost his mother,
you know?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.448
Can we not give him
a little bit of time?

25:34.324 --> 25:35.450
All right.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.453
So...

25:38.662 --> 25:40.372
First thing tomorrow morning?

25:40.497 --> 25:42.374
- Yeah. We attack at dawn.
- Oh, okay.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.627
How many gay jokes
do you think you have?

25:45.627 --> 25:47.254
Oh, I got, like, a dozen...

25:47.879 --> 25:49.214
Oof.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.050
Hey, you guys know that they cremated,
uh, Jerry's body today.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.635
Where should we put him, guys?

25:53.635 --> 25:55.345
I don't know.
Some place appropriate.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.596
I say we put him in the can.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.348
What about the gambling money?

25:58.348 --> 26:00.100
- Not that can, asshole.
- The shitter.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.518
I say stall number one.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.687
I think that was always
his personal favorite.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.606
Except it's my favorite too, and
what if I want to take a shit in there?

26:06.606 --> 26:09.734
I may not want the chief
staring at me making my ass tighten up.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.278
Well, then, young Mr. Garrity,

26:11.278 --> 26:12.737
I would suggest
you load up on bran.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.698
Bran?
Yeah, maybe prune juice.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.534
That make you shit?
Prune juice makes you shit.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.952
Tommy, where you taking us?

26:19.202 --> 26:20.912
There it is, guys.
Down there, see it?

26:20.912 --> 26:22.038
Around the corner.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.707
All right, ladder six and two,

26:23.832 --> 26:25.917
we got some, uh,
medium smoke up here on two.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.752
<i>Should I send somebody in?</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:29.379
- Yeah.
- It's seeping out, boys.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.048
- Here she is.
- You got this, Franco?

26:32.048 --> 26:33.550
Yeah.
Got that, bitch?

26:33.550 --> 26:35.635
Yeah, we're gonna need
a line up here.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.512
Run a line up on two.
Change tankers.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.763
You got it, Franco?

26:38.763 --> 26:40.515
Yeah, I got it. You all right?

26:40.515 --> 26:42.851
Where are we now?
Frankie, you got it?

26:42.851 --> 26:43.935
I'm good!

26:43.935 --> 26:45.312
You know where you're going?

26:45.312 --> 26:46.938
Yeah, yeah.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.148
<i>Where are you?</i>

26:48.148 --> 26:49.566
Where are we now?

26:49.566 --> 26:50.650
It's straight.

26:50.650 --> 26:54.362
I'm feeling a piece of cheese
is about to fall on my head.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.114
Yeah, yeah. Get the door.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.158
I don't think that's right.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.163
Get your masks on, boys.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.665
Party's on.

27:05.665 --> 27:09.127
Ah, shit! Ah, goddamn knee.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.754
You all right?

27:11.004 --> 27:14.382
Yeah, goddamn it! Ugh.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.092
All right, boys,
are we all right?

27:16.092 --> 27:17.510
Yeah, hang on, hang on.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.138
Are we good to go?

27:20.138 --> 27:21.598
One second!

27:21.598 --> 27:23.600
Let's go.
Let's get the hell outta here.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.518
<i>Goddamn it, somebody copy!</i>

27:25.769 --> 27:29.064
Ladder 62 to battalion.
We need some lines up here.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.566
Run some lines! Right away.

27:31.566 --> 27:34.027
<i>I'll get a line into you.
Where are you?</i>

27:34.027 --> 27:35.737
To the left. To the left.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.238
Yeah, yeah.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.700
<i>Guys, where are you?</i>

27:42.619 --> 27:44.537
Where the hell are we?

27:44.537 --> 27:46.289
Come on, guys,
I'm running outta air!

27:46.289 --> 27:49.793
You are?
Two minutes left in this tank.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.252
We gotta get the hell outta here.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.256
Check down that hall.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.508
What do you got, Tom?

27:56.508 --> 27:59.552
Tommy, find me something,
'cause we ain't got shit down here!

27:59.552 --> 28:01.471
I'm running low!
How's it going?

28:01.471 --> 28:04.307
Franco's got low air.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.976
You all right?
You all right?

28:06.976 --> 28:08.728
He lost his tank.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.064
Son of a bitch. He lost his tank.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.608
Goddamn it,
come on, get it off.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.235
You all right?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.112
Yeah.
Can you breathe?

28:17.112 --> 28:18.947
Goddamn, I screwed up
my knee, oh, shit.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.448
You all right to walk?

28:20.448 --> 28:22.951
We gotta get outta here.
I got no air.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.954
I got it.
Shit!

28:26.079 --> 28:28.832
<i>Talk to me, Tommy.</i> Yeah.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.583
Let's go.
Back the way we came.

28:30.583 --> 28:31.876
Okay, all right, good?

28:32.001 --> 28:33.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.839
Uh. Down here.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.799
<i>Guys, where are you?</i>

28:37.924 --> 28:40.635
This-- This looks familiar.
Yeah, yeah, that's it!

28:41.428 --> 28:43.722
Okay.
Thank God.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.682
Uh, goddamn it,
I lost a glove.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.727
Where the hell are we?
I don't know.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.853
Oh, man!

28:49.853 --> 28:51.855
We're officially
lost right now.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.190
Shit!
We were here before.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.526
- Where the hell are we?
- Where's Mikey?

28:56.526 --> 28:57.610
What?
What?

28:57.610 --> 28:58.945
Where's Mikey?

28:59.070 --> 29:00.405
I thought he
was with you guys.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.323
Mikey!

29:02.449 --> 29:03.950
Okay. All right, all right.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.910
Silletti! Where are you?

29:05.910 --> 29:08.079
Calm down. Calm down.
Check around there.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.706
See if that's a way out.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.126
Hey. See if that's
a way out. No?

29:13.126 --> 29:15.962
Nothing. Nothing!

29:16.087 --> 29:17.505
You got him on the walkie?

29:17.630 --> 29:19.048
<i>Somebody copy.</i>

29:19.048 --> 29:21.134
Christ.
It's worse down here, guys.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.094
This place is like a maze.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.472
I think it's out this way,
so everybody get low.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.806
Get low! Oh, shit.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.476
<i>Should I send somebody in?</i>

29:29.601 --> 29:32.520
Tom, Tom, it's not right.
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

29:32.520 --> 29:33.730
Listen, listen!

29:35.106 --> 29:37.734
Here, let's go!
Get over there.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.527
<i>Answer me, goddamn it!</i>

29:39.527 --> 29:41.821
All right, we got one!

29:41.821 --> 29:44.532
- Get away from the door!
- Get away from the door!

29:44.657 --> 29:46.117
Tell her to get away
from the door!

29:49.120 --> 29:50.997
Oh, shit.
Ah, Christ.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.791
Jesus.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.001
I don't know.
Looks like her water broke.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.712
Franco, what is she saying?

29:57.837 --> 30:00.298
She's dropping for real,
this baby's coming right now.

30:00.423 --> 30:03.426
We got two minutes
before this room is engulfed in flames.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.011
Two minutes?
We can't move her!

30:05.136 --> 30:06.513
We gotta get her outta here.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.640
What's going on?
You're not squeamish?

30:08.765 --> 30:11.351
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, God...

30:11.476 --> 30:14.062
- Oh, great. Oh, that's perfect.
- We've lost Sean.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.814
Goddamn dependable--

30:15.814 --> 30:18.066
Tommy, you get down there
and take care of this.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.859
All right, go ahead,
take a look.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.653
No, go ahead, go ahead.
You do it, you got kids.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.363
What do you--?
I didn't deliver my kids.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.073
I don't know nothing
about birthing babies.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.658
Come on. You do it.
I'll be right here.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.326
I'll assist. I'll assist.
That's great.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.829
I'm here for the assist.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.080
Oh, God.
I got my light.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.873
Okay, push, push,
push, push, push.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.750
- You got it?
- Oh, Jesus.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.585
It's gonna be fine, ma'am!
It's gonna be fine.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.214
All right, all right,
here's the baby.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.049
All right, hold this--
Hold this up.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.843
Hold still.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.137
Ah! Uh, all right now,
the cord is cut, you're gonna be fine.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.473
Let's go, guys!
I got a search line!

30:50.473 --> 30:52.809
Probie! Yes!
Let's go, guys!

30:52.809 --> 30:54.310
You got the baby. Okay.
You got her.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.145
Yeah.

30:56.145 --> 30:58.231
Come on, come on,
let's get outta here!

30:58.231 --> 30:59.774
You okay?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.568
Yeah, we're fine.
The baby's fine.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.902
They're naming it
after you, okay?

31:02.902 --> 31:04.612
They're naming the baby Sean?

31:04.904 --> 31:06.531
They're naming it Dickhead.
Let's go.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.907
So thank you for squeezing us in.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.409
I know that you're probably busy.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.829
No worries.
So, what can I help you with?

31:12.829 --> 31:15.915
Well, uh, we're not, um, really married.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.251
You know, we sort of--
We're sort of split up.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.128
Uh, yeah,
a couple times, but--

31:20.253 --> 31:23.089
Um, but we-- We've never really
made the divorce final, um,

31:23.214 --> 31:24.507
so we're sort of
at a crossroads.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.633
Yeah. Crossroads.

31:25.633 --> 31:28.803
And we're thinking of maybe making another
attempt to save the marriage.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.221
- Great.
- Yeah.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.891
So why don't you give me
a little recent family history

31:32.891 --> 31:34.601
so I know what we're dealing with.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.019
Um, high school sweethearts.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.813
- That's true.
- Yeah. Um, dated, had sex,

31:38.938 --> 31:40.315
- got pregnant, got married.
- Yeah.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.442
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Blah, blah, blah.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.944
- Um, the early years were good.
- Yeah, pretty good.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.614
- I thought they were great.
- Well--

31:47.864 --> 31:48.865
Then we kinda drifted apart.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.451
He was always emotionally absent
because of his job.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.120
I'm a firefighter,
so you have to keep all emotions

31:54.120 --> 31:55.580
and all that crap at bay,
you know?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.165
So he would work all day
and come home,

31:57.290 --> 32:00.251
but he wouldn't talk about work,
and, uh, I felt closed off,

32:00.376 --> 32:01.753
and I didn't feel like having sex.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.421
Yeah. This went on for a while.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.965
- Yeah, seven and a half years.
- Shit, really?

32:06.090 --> 32:07.300
- Yeah.
- Can I say shit?

32:07.425 --> 32:10.887
- Uh, that's fine.
- Yeah, shit. Wow.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.263
- So, um, we split up.
- Yeah.

32:12.263 --> 32:15.141
And, uh, then he rented
the place across the street from us

32:15.266 --> 32:16.851
so he could be near the kids

32:16.976 --> 32:19.854
and, um, to keep an eye on me
to watch who I was dating.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.356
You should've seen
that group of guys.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.316
Couple of winners there.
Like that guy Roger.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.193
Okay, yeah,
who swore that you tried

32:25.318 --> 32:26.861
to burn his face off
on your stove.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.947
I-- I can't even--
I don't even cook.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.907
Okay, so I don't know
what he's talking about.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.867
She takes the kids,
the furniture, the money,

32:32.992 --> 32:34.327
everything, goes to Ohio.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.162
It was not a good moment,
but I came back.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.956
- I tracked her down.
- Yes, and I came back.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.040
Yeah, you came back.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.541
Then he decided
to start dating

32:40.667 --> 32:42.794
the widow of his cousin
who died in 9/11.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.505
- Okay.
- Yeah, and then she got pregnant.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.507
Okay, I didn't decide,
it just happened. Okay?

32:47.507 --> 32:49.300
Okay, what are we, grade six?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.678
Sh-She either had a miscarriage
or she had an abortion.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.179
- I don't know which.
- She's a little...

32:53.179 --> 32:56.307
But she got pregnant
because she was sleeping with my brother.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.726
But I'm sure that's my baby
because we were having an affair

32:58.726 --> 33:02.271
while she was having the affair
with my now dead brother.

33:04.023 --> 33:07.276
And then, um, our son
was killed by a drunk driver.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.612
Yeah, and who my uncle,
um, then shot.

33:09.737 --> 33:13.658
You might have read about that.
That was in the papers and stuff.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.536
And... the "rape."

33:16.536 --> 33:18.955
Right, but we don't--

33:18.955 --> 33:20.665
We don't have time
to go into that right now.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.958
- Um...
- Um...

33:21.958 --> 33:23.626
So we've been through a lot.

33:23.626 --> 33:27.380
But, you know, we feel like
there's still some passion left.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.756
Passion.
So.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.883
Yeah, so, what do you think?

33:36.389 --> 33:38.182
One second.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.362
Yeah, Dick, Don Weiss.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.948
You got me! Almost!

33:55.408 --> 33:57.368
God, I almost fell for it,
you rotten bastard.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.953
But then it just went
way over the top.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.164
I mean, it just got
a little too crazy

34:01.164 --> 34:02.999
with the dead son,
and the killing

34:02.999 --> 34:05.126
of the drunk driver, and the--

34:06.461 --> 34:08.087
Really?

34:09.589 --> 34:11.257
Don't mess with me, Dick.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.137
Really.

34:19.432 --> 34:21.017
I'll call you later.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.317
I, uh--
You know, I don't...

34:29.442 --> 34:33.071
Really have the kind of time
that you're gonna need.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.081
Hey, how's it going
on the Jimmy the Jew front?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.624
You know,
it doesn't make sense.

34:44.749 --> 34:47.001
The guy is a shit stain.
There should be stories galore.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.461
What do you got so far?

34:48.586 --> 34:51.631
He put an addition onto his kitchen
without the proper permits.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.050
He's got a half a dozen
unpaid parking tickets,

34:54.050 --> 34:56.594
he's got a DUI
from about 10 years ago.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.848
The rumor is he strangled his neighbor's
dog for crapping on his lawn.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.101
Without the kitchen thing,
that could be me.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.477
- Or me.
- You got nothing, Lou.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.937
Yeah, tell me about it.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.563
I'm going over
and I'm gonna confront him.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.148
Either I find
something good by then,

35:09.148 --> 35:10.942
or I'm just gonna start
making shit up.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.152
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.654
How's it going, kid?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.114
Eh, not so good.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.449
Well, well, well.
Franco, look.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.494
I should let you know right now,
I'll continue working

35:21.619 --> 35:23.371
and I'm keeping
my maiden name.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.832
This is a honey, man.
This must've set you back, huh?

35:26.082 --> 35:27.792
- When did you get that?
- Last night after work.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.669
Sold my goddamn Jeep to get it.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.630
And yet somehow it didn't
find its way onto a finger.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.882
Yeah, I just--
I don't know, Ken, you know?

35:34.882 --> 35:36.717
I'm really conflicted.
I mean...

35:37.135 --> 35:38.719
Closer I get to getting
toasted on this job,

35:38.845 --> 35:40.680
the more I end up
thinking about Natalie

35:40.680 --> 35:43.141
and how much I love her more
than any other girl before,

35:43.141 --> 35:46.352
and it's all romantic and everything,
but on the other hand, it's marriage.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.104
I'm shitting my pants.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.648
Which tends to ruin the romance
part you mentioned earlier.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.692
I mean, what do I know
about marriage?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.694
Hey, look, you know,
what does anybody know?

35:54.694 --> 35:56.654
But you know what,
you wanna take the plunge,

35:56.654 --> 35:58.364
you do a little
quick and easy research.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.784
You go to someone
who's happily married, get his take on it.

36:01.909 --> 36:05.246
Go to someone who's not happily married,
let him weigh in.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.456
Yeah, what about you, Lou?
You were married, right?

36:07.456 --> 36:10.585
Yep, to a dirty, filthy,
little, blood-sucking whore.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.671
I promise you, you're gonna wanna
jump out of a goddamn window.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.631
You know, you're gonna
wake up one morning...

36:15.631 --> 36:17.508
I don't wanna compare
Natalie to Maggie

36:17.508 --> 36:19.927
'cause Maggie's insane,
but Natalie, you never know...

36:20.178 --> 36:21.512
- Hey. Hey. Oh.
- Hey.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.930
What are you guys talking about?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.266
We were just-- We were just
talking about marriage.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.934
You're talking to him
about marriage?

36:26.934 --> 36:29.061
This is the guy who's married
to my lunatic sister.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.396
She wants a divorce.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.898
You were warned, okay.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.566
- Take a hike. Go.
- Wha-- We're talking.

36:33.566 --> 36:36.319
- Take a walk.
- Jesus Christ.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.200
What, you looking for...

36:42.200 --> 36:43.951
I'm just looking for
a positive take

36:43.951 --> 36:45.578
on marriage, Tommy,
but I'm outta luck.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.330
Well, no, actually, you're not.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.624
I'm the perfect guy
for you right now.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.501
I know, I know, I know.
I mean...

36:52.627 --> 36:54.670
All these years I've been
talking about Janet

36:54.670 --> 36:58.758
and how crazy she is,
and how illogical,

36:58.883 --> 37:00.927
and nonsensical,

37:00.927 --> 37:05.014
and how she never ever's
gonna be satisfied with anything.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.307
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.309
It turns out I was right.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.435
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.270
But it's not just her.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.065
It's pretty much all women.
That's what I-- Yeah.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.027
But the problem is I was
approaching it the wrong way.

37:18.027 --> 37:22.406
Yeah. I was thinking about,
you know, me and, uh, sex--

37:22.406 --> 37:24.992
And by the way,
the sex thing is the key. It's--

37:25.117 --> 37:27.370
Sex really has nothing
to do with marriage.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.829
It's tits, ass, sex...

37:29.080 --> 37:30.289
Just throw that
out the window.

37:30.414 --> 37:34.210
The key stuff is listening.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.087
You gotta be able to listen

37:36.087 --> 37:38.631
an-an-and have long conversations
that you remember.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.634
Um... Hugging.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.469
Hugging?
Yeah, hugging is a big one.

37:43.594 --> 37:48.307
Um, buying furniture
and, uh, what's the other one?

37:48.307 --> 37:50.268
Spooning. Yeah.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.979
Okay, now,
let me get this straight.

37:52.979 --> 37:57.650
You, okay, Tommy Gavin,
one of the all-time

37:58.150 --> 38:00.027
hall of fame type pussy hounds

38:00.152 --> 38:01.988
in the history of the F.D.N.Y.
in my opinion...

38:01.988 --> 38:04.115
You are telling me that I should

38:04.240 --> 38:06.284
forget about ass,
forget about tits,

38:06.284 --> 38:09.203
forget about sex,
and focus on, uh,

38:09.328 --> 38:12.081
caring, and sharing,
and listening,

38:12.081 --> 38:14.417
and hugging, and uh...

38:14.417 --> 38:15.793
Put spooning.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.795
Right. Uh--
I mean, this is, uh...

38:17.795 --> 38:19.588
This is what's making
your marriage work?

38:19.588 --> 38:20.881
Yep.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.885
That and the fact
that my dick apparently

38:24.885 --> 38:27.138
doesn't work
with any other women.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.765
Really sucks.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.475
But, you know, if I were you,

38:31.475 --> 38:33.853
I'd pull the trigger
as fast as I can, pal.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.313
Get yourself hitched.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.189
What do you want?

38:37.189 --> 38:39.525
I wanna talk about a couple
things. Can I come in?

38:39.650 --> 38:40.860
No, what do you want?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.903
Rummaging through your
Hitler memorabilia?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.613
Not funny.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.116
Hey, is that Mike Merritt's
car over there?

38:47.116 --> 38:49.285
Yeah, his brother
lives across the street.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.495
Why, what?
Small world.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.456
I think he's about to get a ticket.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.915
Hey, I'm serious.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.710
Hey, you going home, bro?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.712
Uh, yeah, a little bit.

39:00.212 --> 39:04.550
Listen, uh, you mind
if I stay with you for a couple days?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.218
Why?

39:06.344 --> 39:09.388
Well, you know, you-you've
been feeling kinda bad,

39:09.513 --> 39:11.557
and, you know, you're all alone
in that big house.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.517
I thought it might be
kinda scary for you.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.686
Maybe I'd come and hang out
with you, you know?

39:15.895 --> 39:17.355
Lift your spirits a little.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.440
That's really cool, Sean.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.525
I forgot, like,
what a good friend you can be.

39:23.652 --> 39:26.697
Plus I might be
getting a divorce.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.949
You name me one firefighter in town

39:29.200 --> 39:30.618
who doesn't have
at least a half dozen

39:30.743 --> 39:32.870
parking tickets outstanding
in any one given time.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.122
Oh, and how about this addition
you put onto your kitchen

39:35.122 --> 39:36.832
without getting
one single permit.

39:36.957 --> 39:38.876
You're telling me
all the construction jobs

39:38.876 --> 39:40.252
you do with your crew
on the side,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.129
you get all the proper permits for that.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.423
Oh, goddamn it, Jimmy!
I want that probie!

39:44.548 --> 39:46.342
You guys have
a solid basketball team.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.135
You've won five
outta the last eight

39:48.260 --> 39:50.137
- division championships.
- Six.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.306
Well, then share the wealth a little bit.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.766
Where's your sense of sportsmanship?

39:53.766 --> 39:56.268
I never heard of it. Get out.

39:57.269 --> 40:01.065
Well...
Can't blame a guy for trying.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.401
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.778
All right, look, one--
One last final offer, okay?

40:05.903 --> 40:07.780
Your roof could use
some serious repairs.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.908
You hand me over the probie,
I'll come over here with my crew,

40:10.908 --> 40:13.619
brand-new roof, it's not gonna
cost you one penny.

40:13.619 --> 40:15.329
How's that?

40:15.955 --> 40:17.581
Bless you.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.221
Bless you.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.389
Thank you.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.016
And how are we today,
Mrs. Merritt?

40:36.142 --> 40:37.393
Fine.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.519
Just a little chilly.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.397
Yeah, yeah, I can imagine.

40:41.397 --> 40:44.608
Um, look, I'm gonna go back,
uh, to the firehouse.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.945
I gotta find a locker
for my new probie.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.322
Bye now...

40:50.322 --> 40:51.532
Mrs. Merritt!

40:51.657 --> 40:53.617
Mrs. MERRITT: Bye!

40:57.496 --> 40:59.290
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.666
Oh, are those for me?

41:00.666 --> 41:02.710
Yep.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.172
What's, um--
Hey, what's going on?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.215
Well, um, and this is for you.

41:09.758 --> 41:10.759
Wow.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.261
Mm-hm.

41:12.261 --> 41:15.306
Where, um...
Where's Katy?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.141
Uh, Katy's at a pajama party.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.392
Oh.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.518
And, uh, I gave him

41:19.643 --> 41:20.978
a Jameson-Benadryl combo.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.147
One teaspoon of each
and he went down.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.774
- Jesus Christ.
- Mm-hm.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.068
A little Jamedryl. Wow.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.780
Um, okay.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.532
Uh, Jesus Christ.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.080
Yeah.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.832
Mmm.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.375
Ahh.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.723
Ahh.

41:57.723 --> 41:59.141
Here, let's...

41:59.266 --> 42:01.185
Okay.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.394
Here.

42:21.121 --> 42:22.289
What's wrong?

42:22.289 --> 42:23.707
Uh...

42:25.000 --> 42:26.252
Nothing.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.263
There's, uh...

42:37.388 --> 42:39.390
Not a heck of a lot
going on down there.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.017
No, wait.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.355
Shit.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.274
Oh, my God.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.776
This is it.
This is the end of the line.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.611
Wh-Wh-What?

42:52.611 --> 42:54.363
Yeah, no,
I've heard about this.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.073
What are you talking about?
Honey--

42:56.282 --> 42:59.410
Tommy, you have never ever
not gotten it up for me.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.788
Honey, just--
I just need to--

43:02.788 --> 43:04.206
What?

43:04.331 --> 43:06.834
Tommy, I get wet, you get hard,
you get hard, I get wet.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.168
- That's the deal.
- I know.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.920
It's been the deal
for 20-some years.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.755
It may as well have been
our marriage vows.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.507
I know. I know.

43:13.632 --> 43:17.052
So, uh, I just came home.
I just, you know. What?

43:17.177 --> 43:19.305
- My cousin Suzy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.223
Yes, yes, she woke up
one morning

43:21.223 --> 43:23.642
and her husband just didn't
have it for her anymore.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.811
Honey, she gained 75 pounds
in 6 months.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.313
She wasn't even pregnant, okay?

43:27.438 --> 43:28.939
- That's not the point.
- What's the point?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.609
The point is...
It's done.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.860
That thing, that chemistry.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.195
We don't have
that thing anymore.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.156
You don't have that thing
for me anymore.

43:37.156 --> 43:40.618
My thing is just having a--

43:40.618 --> 43:43.537
You have never
not gotten hard for me.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.832
It's just-- It's not you.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.208
It's just--

43:48.208 --> 43:50.085
No, it's--

43:50.210 --> 43:51.837
Some-- I don't know.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.339
Mental thing.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.840
It happened the other night.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.050
I'm sure it's just a--

43:56.175 --> 43:57.343
Excuse me?

43:59.178 --> 44:00.220
What?

44:00.346 --> 44:02.514
What? The other night?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.016
The other night, you--

44:04.141 --> 44:06.352
You fell asleep,
he was still up.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.354
I put him to bed.
I'm sitting here by myself.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.440
I'm horny. You're asleep
so I'm watching, um,

44:11.857 --> 44:14.818
Cinemax, and, uh,

44:14.818 --> 44:18.572
that movie with, um, um,
what's her name?

44:18.572 --> 44:20.783
She looks like Michelle Pfeiffer
and Peter Gallagher--

44:20.783 --> 44:22.618
You know what,
I cannot believe

44:22.618 --> 44:24.828
that you are trying
to have sex with someone else

44:24.953 --> 44:26.705
when we're going through this.

44:28.374 --> 44:32.419
Honey, she basically attacked me.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.712
Shit.

44:33.712 --> 44:35.381
Okay, hang on, pal.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.342
It was that chick
who saved me in the fire.

44:38.342 --> 44:41.637
I-- She's a brute.
I think she's on steroids.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.057
Honey...

44:47.643 --> 44:49.603
Can you pass me out
the Benadryl?

44:52.856 --> 44:55.401
It's over. You know it.

44:57.569 --> 44:59.488
Honey.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.491
All right, pal, come here.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.076
Okay, I got you, I got you.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.537
Yep, yep, I know, I know.
Come here, come here, come here.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.540
Shh. Shh.

45:10.999 --> 45:12.292
All right?

45:19.091 --> 45:20.592
Okay, okay, shh.

45:23.595 --> 45:25.639
All right, shh.
I got you. I got you.
