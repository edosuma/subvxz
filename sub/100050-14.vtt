00:08.138 --> 00:10.967
ADULT SHELDON: The Clean Air Act
required all new cars

00:11.011 --> 00:13.883
to be equipped with
catalytic converters

00:13.926 --> 00:15.711
to combat air pollution.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.235
The first state to do this
was California,

00:18.279 --> 00:20.672
which led Texans
to say things like...

00:20.716 --> 00:23.371
I hate California.ADULT SHELDON: And...

00:23.414 --> 00:26.069
When will that place fall
in the ocean?

00:26.113 --> 00:28.506
ADULT SHELDON: While not
everyone was happy about it,

00:28.550 --> 00:30.943
six years later,
one particular Texan

00:30.987 --> 00:33.033
saw an opportunity
to get rich quick.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.991
Oh, man,
I'm gonna get rich quick.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.602
I just got my ticket
out of here.

00:37.646 --> 00:38.951
Adios.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.041
I'm serious.
This thing is full of tips

00:41.084 --> 00:43.304
on how to make a fortune.
Only cost me a dollar.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.349
Is one of the tips
"make a crappy newsletter

00:45.393 --> 00:47.177
and charge idiots
a dollar for it"?

00:48.222 --> 00:50.006
No, but not a bad idea.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.879
Listen to this: "Raise bees
and sell the honey for profit."

00:53.923 --> 00:55.794
Do it, and I'm living
with Meemaw.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.188
"Sell blood
or non-vital organs."

00:58.232 --> 01:00.060
Mm, give 'em your brain.
You're not using it.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.065
I think that's the only time
I've ever heard you laugh.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.284
That's the only time
you've ever been funny.

01:07.328 --> 01:11.767
Oh, platinum can be extracted
from ordinary roadside gravel.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.942
No, it can't.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.074
Actually, it can.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.988
Catalytic converters
contain platinum.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.599
Microparticles of that platinum

01:17.642 --> 01:18.730
are expelled
in the exhaust

01:18.774 --> 01:20.471
and are mixed in
with the gravel.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.344
See? This thing's a gold mine.

01:23.387 --> 01:27.348
It would be more apt
to call it a platinum mine.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.481

you give advice.

Oh, smart. Man's been in
a slump his whole life.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.242
You just got to get out
of your head.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
You... you're thinking too much.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.986

Pray.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.252
It works.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.080
In fact, I'm gonna pray
for you tonight.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.343
Everybody prays to God
at night.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.911
Do it now while
he's got some free time.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.655
Hey what you doing?

03:40.698 --> 03:43.440
Playing a historically accurate
game called The Oregon Trail.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.268
That sounds boring.

03:45.312 --> 03:49.011
Hardly. My wagon broke an axle,
and my wife died of dysentery.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.274
Well, can you pause it
for a sec?

03:51.318 --> 03:53.755
It does seems rude
to push on to Oregon

03:53.798 --> 03:57.149
while my daughter Mabel is
mourning the loss of her mother.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.413
What can I do for you?

03:59.456 --> 04:02.111
Remember when we were talking
about platinum in gravel?

04:02.154 --> 04:03.678
Do you know how to get it out?

04:03.721 --> 04:05.332
It's not a complicated
principle.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.291
I could probably do it with my
Professor Proton chemistry set.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.599
Great.And an oven that reaches
2,000 degrees.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.122
Does our oven do that?

04:13.165 --> 04:14.950
No, but I read you can build one

04:14.993 --> 04:17.082
out of a garbage can
and a leaf blower.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.519
Cool. Let's mine some platinum.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.782
No, thank you.
I don't care about money.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.398
But you care
about science, right?

04:28.442 --> 04:30.095
Of course.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.184
So I offer you the chance
to do an experiment

04:32.228 --> 04:34.883
and you'd rather play
a video game?

04:36.928 --> 04:39.104
What would
Professor Proton think?

04:43.065 --> 04:44.849
He'd be disappointed.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.677
So what do you say?

04:46.721 --> 04:48.723
I say we collect gravel.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.246
There you go.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.728
ADULT SHELDON:
In case you're worried,

04:53.771 --> 04:55.904
Mabel and I did finally
make it to Oregon,

04:55.947 --> 04:59.299
where I remarried and lived
to the ripe old age of 41.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.828
DALE:
All right, Cooper, remember
what I told you, okay?

05:06.871 --> 05:08.351
Knees bent, elbows out,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.440
eye on the ball.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.137
Hang on.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.966
Hi, God. It's Missy Cooper.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.534
I know my mom talked to you
about me the other day,

05:17.578 --> 05:19.144
and she's, like,
your biggest fan.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.190
Hey, what's going on?

05:21.233 --> 05:22.974
What, did you
fall asleep?

05:23.018 --> 05:24.062
Sorry, I was praying.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.195
Oh, my apologies.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.027
MISSY: Anyway, I could really
use your help getting a hit.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.594
Amen.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.770
Okay.Are we good?

05:35.813 --> 05:37.511
I don't know.
We'll find out.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.860
Okay, remember,

05:38.903 --> 05:40.514
elbows up,

05:40.557 --> 05:42.690
knees bent.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.779
I'm coming at you, Cooper.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.395
Way to go. Perfect.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.571
Thank you, God.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.572
How about, "Thank you, Coach"?

05:55.616 --> 05:57.531
Thank you, Coach.Too late.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.578
This should be a good spot.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.276
It's a high-traffic area,
which means plenty of exhaust,

06:04.320 --> 06:05.800
and therefore
plenty of platinum.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.628
Great. Let's get shoveling.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.160
You ain't gonna help?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.770
No.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.600
How was practice?

06:23.644 --> 06:25.907
Great. I hit the ball
further than anyone.

06:25.950 --> 06:29.040
Sounds like a little prayer
helped after all.

06:29.084 --> 06:32.087
I guess it did.You seem surprised.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.958
Well, God knows
everything,

06:34.002 --> 06:35.699
and I have some
pretty evil thoughts.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.918
Oh, Missy.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.746
Ooh, what if I start
wearing a cross

06:38.789 --> 06:40.400
so God knows I mean business?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.489
You could also
clean up your thinking.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.448
Nah.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.022
What's taking so long?

06:54.065 --> 06:56.067
It'd be faster if you helped.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.027
Well, we know
that's not happening.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.682
MISSY: I know you got your hands
full with all that sad stuff,

07:01.725 --> 07:05.773
like disease and war
and hunger and poverty,

07:05.816 --> 07:08.950
so thanks again for helping me
get some hits at practice.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.560
Amen.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.389
Don't forget to ask him to keep
our family safe and healthy.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.609
I just hung up.
Don't make me call him back.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.183
Should I be wearing
all that?

07:25.227 --> 07:27.098
I recommend it.
Those rocks are filthy.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.012
I'm good.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.231
God made dirt.
Dirt don't hurt.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.711
Where do we start?

07:30.754 --> 07:33.104
The first step is to put
the gravel in these colanders,

07:33.148 --> 07:35.498
and then sift it over the tray
to collect the dust.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.636
It's like finding money
in the street.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.334
Why do you care so much
about money?

07:45.377 --> 07:47.945
You saw Back to the Futurewhen
their dad's rich at the end,

07:47.989 --> 07:50.557
his wife is all skinny
and loves him way more.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.560
So you want a wife who loves you
because you have money?

07:53.603 --> 07:55.257
A skinny wife.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.478
I have something for you.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.915
You said you
wanted a cross,

08:00.958 --> 08:04.788
and this is the one I used to
wear when I was your age.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.181
It's so pretty.

08:06.224 --> 08:09.010
I'm glad you like it.

08:09.053 --> 08:13.275
It's a nice reminder
that wherever you are,

08:13.318 --> 08:14.885
God is always with you.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.673
And it means a lot to me
that you want to wear it.

08:19.716 --> 08:23.459
Thanks, Mom.
I'm gonna pray right now.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.374
God, it's Missy again.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.681
If you can hear me better, it's
'cause I'm wearing a cross now.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.987
Please let me get
a lot of hits on Saturday.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.686
And if their star pitcher breaks his arm or gets run over

08:32.729 --> 08:35.602
by a truck, I'd totally
be okay with that.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.604
Amen.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.823
Amen.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.695
Now we have to sift
the powder again

08:41.738 --> 08:43.827
because the platinum particles
are extremely small,

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
sometimes no more than
just a few atoms.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.093
If I was as smart as you,
I'd play the stock market.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.660
Or go on Price Is Right.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.620
I'd rather spend my time
focusing on important things,

08:53.663 --> 08:56.013
like figuring out how
the universe works.

08:56.057 --> 09:00.583
So, say you figure out how
the universe works. Then what?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.977
I'm not sure,
but in the meantime,

09:03.020 --> 09:04.413
I agree with
Richard Feynman.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.677
I simply enjoy the pleasure
of finding things out.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.244
I agree with the Beastie Boys.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.594
You got to fight
for your right to party.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.510
Well, it's good to have
a personal philosophy.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.469
GEORGE JR.:
What's next?We create a chemical flux

09:17.513 --> 09:19.254
by combining borax,
sodium carbonate,

09:19.297 --> 09:20.690
lead oxide and flour.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.692
Did you know
Sheldon and Georgie

09:22.736 --> 09:24.041
are working
on something together?

09:24.085 --> 09:26.348
That's nice. And guess what--

09:26.391 --> 09:28.742
Missy asked me
if she could wear a cross.

09:28.785 --> 09:31.614
She's in her bedroom
saying prayers right now.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.051
Hmm. I don't like it.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.706
What are you talking about?
Our kids are behaving.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.274
Exactly.
Something bad's gonna happen.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.928
Why can't you just be thankful?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.495
Because that's when life kicks
you right in the plums, Mary.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.933
Dad, where's your power drill?

09:45.976 --> 09:48.588
Why?Our oven doesn't reach
2,000 degrees,

09:48.631 --> 09:50.372
so we're going to make
a homemade kiln

09:50.415 --> 09:51.765
out of a garbage can.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.288
And there go the plums.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.812
Are you two trying
to burn down the house?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.032
No, we're trying to make
platinum out of gravel.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.295
You're not building
a 2,000-degree oven.

10:00.338 --> 10:03.385
Fine. Just so you know,
I was gonna cut you in.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.823
Really? You'll fight
for your right to party

10:06.867 --> 10:08.216
but not for your right
to make a device

10:08.259 --> 10:09.783
that'll exceed
the melting point of lead?

10:09.826 --> 10:11.175
GEORGE JR.:
Shut up.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.221
Ooh, "Why can't you
be thankful?"

10:17.355 --> 10:18.705
What's your problem?

10:18.748 --> 10:20.750
Mom and Dad won't
let me build a kiln,

10:20.794 --> 10:23.710
so Georgie and I can't
finish our experiment.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.842
Before you tell me,
I don't care what a kiln is.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.323
Okay, but you'll never know
it's a high-temperature oven.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.108
If you're unhappy,
just ask God for help.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.414
I don't believe in God.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.372
He can hear you.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.679
He knows if you've
been bad or good.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.334
Like Santa,
but he can send you to hell.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.770
I'm not going to ask
some magical being

10:40.814 --> 10:42.206
to solve my problems.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.382
I asked him to help me
with my batting, and he did.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.911
There's a pottery kiln
in art class. We can use that.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.741
Georgie,
I figured it out!

10:54.784 --> 10:58.919
Good job, but that does not
count as one of my wishes.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.272
Why are we being sneaky?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.187
I thought you said
we have permission.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.886
We do. I just don't want anybody
knowing about our platinum.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.497
Smart. Last week, I bragged
about having a Nutter Butter,

11:12.541 --> 11:15.065
and some rat stole it
right out of my lunch bag.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.807
Well, it sure wasn't me.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.940
And then I hit it over
the right fielder's head.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.811
Sounds like you had
a good practice.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.770
I did. Coach said
he's gonna have me hit cleanup.

11:23.813 --> 11:24.988
BILLY:
Missy,

11:25.032 --> 11:26.990
will you rub your cross
on my bat?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.035
No.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.558
Have you been doing that?

11:29.601 --> 11:31.038
On mine. It's working great.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.343
Please?

11:32.387 --> 11:34.128
I'll give you a dollar.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.043
Fine.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.871
What do you think you're doing?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.742
Sharing God's love
and making some cash.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.222
Absolutely not.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.745
How about I give you the dollar?

11:42.789 --> 11:45.879
God's love has nothing
to do with money.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.489
What about the collection plate
at church?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.491
That is different.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.884
That's where I found
this dollar.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.233
Okay.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.278
Bye.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.845
So now we just wait
for the concrete dust

11:55.889 --> 11:57.891
to dissolve
and the lead to melt?

11:57.934 --> 11:59.544
That's exactly right.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.155
I know. I listen.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.896
And you understand it?I work in sales.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.898
I don't need to know
what I'm talking about

12:04.941 --> 12:06.377
to make it sound good.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.031
Don't you think it would
make you better at your job

12:08.075 --> 12:10.077
if you understood the products
you were selling?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.470
No. People don't
want to hear facts.I do.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.212
Normal people don't
want to hear facts.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.648
I'm normal.

12:16.692 --> 12:17.737
Are you?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.782
No, I'm special.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.568
Is it supposed to be doing that?Something's wrong.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.092
Maybe we didn't sift out
all the rubber.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.484
I think it's burning.Okay.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.269
Okay, calm down.
I'll handle it.

12:28.312 --> 12:31.838
I'm having difficulty
remaining calm.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.755
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.282
I'm feeling more calm now.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.897
What were you thinking?Well...

12:47.941 --> 12:49.377
I don't want to
hear excuses.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.640
You could've burned
the school down.

12:51.683 --> 12:52.902
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

12:52.946 --> 12:55.687
I thought you didn't want
to hear my excuses.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.472
Oh, no, we didn't break
into the classroom.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.430
Georgie had permission
from the teacher.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.605
That is not important right now.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.782
So you think a teacher
said it was okay

13:02.825 --> 13:04.653
for a ten-year-old and an idiot

13:04.696 --> 13:07.177
to use a 2,000-degree oven
unsupervised?

13:09.353 --> 13:11.094
You fibber.

13:11.138 --> 13:14.706
You also stole my Nutter Butter.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.409
Are you mad at me?

13:21.452 --> 13:23.498
No.
You sure?

13:23.541 --> 13:26.109
'Cause that's how you look when
Dad had that breakfast beer.

13:28.895 --> 13:33.029
To be honest, I'm a little
concerned that I have given you

13:33.073 --> 13:35.815
the wrong impression
about how prayer works.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.730
I get it. I ask God for stuff,
he gives it to me.

13:38.774 --> 13:39.731
It's not rocket science.

13:39.775 --> 13:42.734
Missy, God does not
grant wishes.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.562
So he gave me good luck?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.869
It's not luck.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.873
Luck is chance,
and God has a plan.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.833
Right, and his plan is to give
me what I want when I pray.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.269
That's why he's so cool.

13:55.312 --> 13:58.272
No. I... I mean, he is cool,

13:58.315 --> 14:01.101
but sometimes
that might not be his plan.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.450
Then what's the point of praying

14:02.493 --> 14:04.017
if he's just gonna do
what he wants?

14:04.060 --> 14:06.628
You don't pray to God
to get things.

14:06.671 --> 14:09.587
You pray to build
a relationship with him.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.287
This is too complicated.
I'm just gonna keep

14:13.330 --> 14:15.419
rubbing this thing on my bat
and kicking butt.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.900
Okay, that is it. Take it off.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.250
No, I need it.
The game's Saturday.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.818
There are more important things
than baseball.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.428
Now, hand it over.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.300
God, cover your ears.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.867
Damn it.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.433
Missy Cooper!

14:29.477 --> 14:31.914
You are not ready for that.
You give that back.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.743
Oh, you... Get!

14:37.789 --> 14:42.011
MARY:
Lord, I really need you
right now.

14:42.055 --> 14:46.015
I have tried so hard to lead
my family to your light,

14:46.059 --> 14:49.889
but so far, Sheldon doesn't believe in you,

14:49.932 --> 14:52.282
Missy thinks
you're a magic trick,

14:52.326 --> 14:53.762
and you're not a teenage girl,

14:53.805 --> 14:56.634
so Georgie doesn't think
about you at all.

14:56.678 --> 15:00.247
I never thought I'd take a cross away from my own child,

15:00.290 --> 15:02.553
but what choice did I have?

15:02.597 --> 15:05.295
She was rubbing it
on sporting equipment.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.384
I didn't think there was
a wrong way to pray,

15:07.428 --> 15:10.344
but leave it
to that girl to find one.

15:10.387 --> 15:14.957
Please give me the strength to
keep guiding my family to you.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.265
I can't do it on my own. Amen.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.139
So, how was everybody's day?

15:27.013 --> 15:29.363
That good, huh?

15:29.406 --> 15:30.886
How about we just say grace?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.541
You're gonna ask him to
bless the food? Interesting.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.977
That is enough.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.848
Oh, come on.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.415
How can I appreciate
all this tension

15:38.459 --> 15:40.113
if I don't know what it's about?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.985
Mom took my cross away, and
I have a game on Saturday.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.770
Why would you do that?
She's out of the slump.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.511
She was being sacrilegious.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.904
Mary, this is sports.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.732
When something's working,
you do not mess with it.

15:50.775 --> 15:54.823
I am not changing my mind.
God is not a good-luck charm.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.999
Well, how about all the players
that kiss their crosses

15:57.043 --> 15:58.740
before they go
in the batter's box?

15:58.783 --> 16:01.351
They can take it up
with their mommies.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.962
So she's finally hitting good,

16:03.005 --> 16:04.789
and you're gonna let her go
to that game all up in her head?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.791
Her relationship with God
is more important

16:06.835 --> 16:09.011
than getting some hits
in a baseball game.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.665
This is perfect.
They're mad at each other.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.058
Takes the heat off us.

16:12.101 --> 16:15.539
Thank you. I had no idea
what was going on.

16:15.583 --> 16:16.888
Mary, give her the cross back.

16:16.932 --> 16:20.501
When she is ready
for it, I will.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.677
I have a bunch of crosses
in my jewelry box.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.766
You can take any
one you want.

16:24.809 --> 16:28.117
I don't want another cross.
I want my lucky cross.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.728
And that is exactly why
she is not ready.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.774
Let's say grace.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.866
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive,

16:37.909 --> 16:39.868
and bless the hands
that prepared it. Amen.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.001
ALL:
Amen.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.745
I'm glad we're no
longer in trouble

16:47.789 --> 16:49.704
for almost burning
the school down.

16:49.747 --> 16:50.835
MEEMAW:
Ooh.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.099
Let's talk about that.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.543
SHELDON: Georgie.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.284
Yeah?

17:05.328 --> 17:07.287
Are you still interested
in getting rich quick?

17:08.331 --> 17:10.464
No, I want to do it slow
like a chump.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.248
Oh. Never mind.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.554
Tell me, Sheldon.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.296
It occurred to me that
a good way to generate

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
a positive cash flow
would be to curate

17:17.949 --> 17:20.691
popular songs and make them
available in a digital form.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.085
Possibly on a small device
that could also be used

17:23.129 --> 17:24.695
as a phone or even a camera.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.655
Right. A phone, camera,
music machine.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.091
Get out of here.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.097
Psst. Hey, Missy.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.446
Come here.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.318
What? I'm up next.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.146
I know. Here.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.760
Don't tell your mother.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.721
I think I want
to do this on my own.You sure?

17:50.765 --> 17:54.073
Just in case Mom's right,
I don't want to make God mad.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.118
UMPIRE:
Strike three. You're out.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.685
All right. Go get 'em.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.264
Strike one!Dad!

18:11.307 --> 18:12.482
GEORGE SR.:
Coming!
