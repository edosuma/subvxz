02:05.608 --> 02:07.008
Mamma?

02:07.743 --> 02:09.176
Mamma.

02:19.087 --> 02:20.589
Thank you.

02:25.594 --> 02:27.797
Help... Help me sit up.

02:35.571 --> 02:37.607
I don't have much time.

02:39.442 --> 02:42.311
I have to know
you're going to be OK.

02:43.812 --> 02:46.246
I will be OK.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.150
Get the map.

02:53.355 --> 02:56.156
I know we've been through this
many times and that you know it,

02:56.158 --> 02:59.495
but just one more time, for me.

03:01.196 --> 03:02.766
Show me the route.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.376
And why this way?

03:15.378 --> 03:16.912
I stay as close
to the water as possible,

03:16.914 --> 03:20.684
for as long as I can.
The water keeps me safe.

03:21.551 --> 03:23.551
- And this?
- Bad.

03:23.553 --> 03:27.422
- Why?
- The wind hides in the cities.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.824
Where else?

03:28.826 --> 03:31.491
Open areas
where there's no water.

03:31.493 --> 03:33.630
And here?

03:34.497 --> 03:36.331
I must be careful.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.534
Look, listen
and use the scanner.

03:39.536 --> 03:40.635
And?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.870
Never be in the open at night.

03:42.872 --> 03:44.171
Even near water.

03:44.173 --> 03:46.810
- You promise?
- I promise.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.314
Come over here.

04:07.897 --> 04:10.467
I wish we could have
gone there together.

04:11.701 --> 04:13.169
So do I.

04:28.886 --> 04:31.588
If I had known
what they did to me.

05:31.382 --> 05:32.781
Mamma?

05:32.783 --> 05:34.251
Mamma?

10:10.098 --> 10:11.830
Who are you?

10:11.832 --> 10:16.037
- I'm Sira. Who are you?
- My name's Lilly.

10:18.071 --> 10:19.671
What are you doing here?

10:19.673 --> 10:23.242
I was with some people
and then the wind came

10:23.244 --> 10:26.045
and we were running
and I got lost.

10:26.047 --> 10:27.780
I saw a man last night.

10:27.782 --> 10:31.649
He was running from the wind.
Was he with you?

10:31.651 --> 10:34.053
I don't know.

10:34.055 --> 10:37.592
- OK. Well, I have to go now.
- Where are you going?

10:38.960 --> 10:41.128
To the place that grants wishes.

10:43.364 --> 10:44.798
Can I come?

10:46.834 --> 10:48.202
OK.

10:55.109 --> 10:57.743
We have to be very quiet
until we get to water.

10:57.745 --> 10:58.946
I know.

11:04.353 --> 11:06.118
What's that?

11:06.120 --> 11:09.755
- It can detect the wind.
- The wind that takes people?

11:09.757 --> 11:11.391
Yeah.

11:11.393 --> 11:13.228
And where did you get it from?

11:14.229 --> 11:16.631
My mother gave it to me.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.217
Was he one of the people
you were with?

11:36.351 --> 11:38.887
I don't know who that is.

12:13.455 --> 12:15.423
Can we talk now?

12:15.425 --> 12:20.026
- Yes, but quietly.
- So where is this place, then,

12:20.028 --> 12:21.930
that grants wishes>

12:28.836 --> 12:31.238
Here. And we're here.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.773
- That's far.
- Yes.

12:33.775 --> 12:35.242
And this place,
when you get there,

12:35.244 --> 12:37.878
you can wish for something
and it comes true?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.813
- Yep.
- How do you know?

12:40.815 --> 12:44.184
- My mother told me.
- Is your mother here?

12:44.186 --> 12:48.424
No. No, she... she died.

12:50.426 --> 12:53.493
Are you gonna wish
for her to be alive again?

12:53.495 --> 12:56.963
How many wishes do you get
in this place? Just one?

12:56.965 --> 13:00.035
- I don't know.
- OK.

13:14.951 --> 13:16.152
We can't go through there.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.022
We have to go back and around.

14:11.941 --> 14:13.410
Sira, your scanner.

14:43.339 --> 14:45.743
How did he do that?

14:47.111 --> 14:49.278
I don't know.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.448
He must have a special power.

14:52.149 --> 14:53.283
I don't know.

14:54.951 --> 14:56.984
Do you think they might help us?

14:56.986 --> 14:58.289
No, Lilly.

15:36.093 --> 15:38.193
It's getting late.

15:38.195 --> 15:40.231
We might have to stay
here tonight.

15:41.532 --> 15:43.567
We can't stay here.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.027
Give me your bags.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.669
Empty your pockets.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.107
- Empty your pockets.
- I don't have anything.

18:23.562 --> 18:27.166
You, boy. Come with me.

18:47.621 --> 18:51.189
- What is this place?
- A refuge.

18:51.191 --> 18:54.593
- A refuge?
- A place of safety.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.330
Wait!

19:14.381 --> 19:16.214
I'll come and see you later.

19:16.216 --> 19:19.251
- It will be OK.
- Will it?

19:21.888 --> 19:25.492
It's a small price to pay for
the protection he affords us.

19:26.726 --> 19:28.427
You will get used to it.

19:52.886 --> 19:54.387
Sit down.

20:03.263 --> 20:04.497
What's this?

20:08.168 --> 20:11.706
The strong, silent type. Hmm?

20:12.873 --> 20:15.743
You use it to deflect the wind.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.843
How? Show me.

20:18.845 --> 20:22.848
You know.
You used it in the field.

20:22.850 --> 20:25.185
Not entirely accurate.

20:29.957 --> 20:33.324
You see, you're not the first
person to have one of these.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.628
Fellow who had this one
must've done something to it,

20:35.630 --> 20:39.398
because I've not been able
to make it work and...

20:39.400 --> 20:44.770
In testing it, it's...
Well, I think you know the rest.

20:44.772 --> 20:47.274
- You pretended?
- I pretended.

20:49.276 --> 20:52.278
- It was the water.
- Clever boy.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.815
Yes.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.317
I know you know
about the effect

20:58.319 --> 21:00.853
bodies of water
have on the wind.

21:00.855 --> 21:03.422
I can see that from the route
you've marked on your map.

21:03.424 --> 21:04.890
But what you can't know

21:04.892 --> 21:08.427
is that if you configure
sufficient quantities of water

21:08.429 --> 21:11.632
in the right geometric pattern,
it has a similar effect.

21:14.335 --> 21:17.569
I'm with you.
I don't understand it either.

21:17.571 --> 21:19.371
It's a shame the chap
who came up with it

21:19.373 --> 21:21.175
isn't around any more.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.678
This map of yours...

21:28.348 --> 21:30.216
I know this area.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.588
There's nothing there.

21:39.695 --> 21:41.727
I'm going to ask you again.

21:41.729 --> 21:44.331
How do you make this
deflect the wind?

21:46.634 --> 21:50.269
You know, I could just beat it
out of you,

21:50.271 --> 21:52.538
but I don't think the women out
there would like it very much.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.373
Contrary to what
you might think,

21:54.375 --> 21:55.776
they have their limits.

21:59.981 --> 22:02.482
Fine.

22:02.484 --> 22:04.850
If you won't show me,
maybe your little friend will.

22:04.852 --> 22:08.456
- She doesn't know anything.
- We shall see.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.224
Jenna!

22:15.363 --> 22:18.800
- Prepare the girl for a test.
- Yes.

22:33.081 --> 22:37.851
Well, my dear. Our little friend
is proving a tad uncooperative.

22:37.853 --> 22:42.289
I'm hoping
this will change his mind.

22:44.426 --> 22:45.994
Now...

22:49.966 --> 22:51.768
What I want you to do...

22:53.702 --> 22:55.971
is walk to that flag.

23:01.644 --> 23:02.779
Off you go.

23:06.548 --> 23:07.783
I don't want to.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.708
- Stay here.
- I don't want to.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.712
Do you want your friend
to be hurt?

23:37.413 --> 23:38.648
No.

23:39.482 --> 23:40.882
Then stay here.

23:53.763 --> 23:58.599
- Why are we doing this?
- To ensure our survival.

23:58.601 --> 24:01.602
But it's not right.

24:01.604 --> 24:06.441
I think we're well beyond right
and wrong in this new world.

24:10.613 --> 24:12.981
Question me again...

24:12.983 --> 24:15.052
and you'll suffer
the same fate as the girl.

24:17.186 --> 24:20.423
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

24:21.157 --> 24:23.524
Good.

24:23.526 --> 24:29.432
Now, this is what happens
to those who don't cooperate.

24:30.766 --> 24:32.068
Please.

24:33.469 --> 24:34.871
Do the honours.

25:23.053 --> 25:25.221
I was right!

25:25.223 --> 25:27.223
All of this
could've been avoided

25:27.225 --> 25:29.159
if you'd just played ball.

25:31.161 --> 25:32.461
Take them back.

25:33.764 --> 25:35.497
The speaker device.

25:35.499 --> 25:38.568
Yes, please fetch it.

25:43.173 --> 25:44.508
No!

25:45.075 --> 25:47.042
I'll do it.

25:47.044 --> 25:51.013
After all, I wouldn't be
much of a protector

25:51.015 --> 25:53.850
if I had you do it, right?

25:58.956 --> 26:01.791
As long as they believe
he protects them,

26:01.793 --> 26:03.227
we will never be free.

26:05.295 --> 26:07.030
It's the water
that stops the wind.

26:08.799 --> 26:11.167
It's his power.

26:11.169 --> 26:14.103
The power of the thing he has.
The same power as you.

26:14.105 --> 26:17.605
It only helps me control it.
It doesn't do anything else.

26:17.607 --> 26:20.044
The one he had was broken.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.614
What if you're wrong?

26:25.616 --> 26:27.085
I'm not.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.597
Turn it off. Turn it off!

27:44.296 --> 27:47.232
Sira, do you mind
if I talk to Lilly alone?

27:53.171 --> 27:54.306
OK.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.262
I'm sorry about what happened.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.798
If we had known the truth,

28:21.800 --> 28:24.603
we would never have let him
do the things he did.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.041
I've spoken to Sira...

28:30.109 --> 28:32.778
and I understand
why he has to go.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.082
But you could stay here.
With us.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.251
I'm going with Sira.

28:41.253 --> 28:48.024
- Why? What's out there?
- A place that grants wishes.

28:48.026 --> 28:50.294
And what will you do
when you get there?

28:50.296 --> 28:53.031
I will ask for my pappa back.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.235
Have you told Sira?

28:59.139 --> 29:00.138
Why ever not?

29:00.140 --> 29:02.406
Sira's going to wish for
his mother to come back

29:02.408 --> 29:06.042
and if there's only one wish,
he won't let me go with him.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.913
How do you know
there's only one wish?

29:09.182 --> 29:11.215
I don't know.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.254
It's a long way to go
to find out.

29:15.155 --> 29:16.255
It's OK.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.158
It's already been a long way.

29:32.372 --> 29:34.841
I hope both your wishes
come true.

29:57.931 --> 30:00.967
- What did she say?
- She wants me to stay.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.471
- Do you want to stay?
- No.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.942
Do you want me to stay?

30:12.178 --> 30:15.280
Well, it's still
a long way, Lilly.

30:15.282 --> 30:17.448
And look
what's happened already.

30:17.450 --> 30:21.087
I don't care.
I know you'll protect me.

30:22.055 --> 30:24.791
Yeah, but... what if I can't?

30:25.459 --> 30:27.094
I know you can.

30:38.038 --> 30:39.139
Goodbye.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.741
And thank you.

35:20.390 --> 35:22.759
Why doesn't the wind
chase the horses?

35:24.160 --> 35:25.560
I don't know.

35:25.562 --> 35:28.230
It doesn't really care
about the animals.

35:48.518 --> 35:49.654
What is it?

35:54.124 --> 35:55.358
It's nothing.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.490
How the hell did you do that?

36:40.236 --> 36:43.273
Get behind me. Get behind me!

36:56.754 --> 36:58.589
I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:59.256 --> 37:00.524
Sira...

37:02.193 --> 37:06.262
It's getting late.
We have to go inside.

37:06.897 --> 37:08.332
He's right.

37:11.903 --> 37:15.971
- You know a place?
- There's a house.

37:15.973 --> 37:17.842
Just beyond those trees.

37:22.713 --> 37:23.849
OK.

37:57.649 --> 37:59.616
Hey, do you wanna keep an eye
on things down here,

37:59.618 --> 38:00.483
I'm just gonna go upstairs.

38:00.485 --> 38:03.686
I don't think
you're gonna need that.

38:03.688 --> 38:04.822
OK.

38:27.445 --> 38:28.778
All clear.

38:28.780 --> 38:31.450
So, wanna get settled in
for the night?

39:32.879 --> 39:37.548
- What's that?
- A book of rhymes.

39:37.550 --> 39:40.050
"The breezes at dawn
have secrets to tell you,

39:40.052 --> 39:42.653
don't go back to sleep.

39:42.655 --> 39:45.022
You must ask for
what you really want,

39:45.024 --> 39:47.591
don't go back to sleep.

39:47.593 --> 39:51.829
People are going back and forth
across the doorsill

39:51.831 --> 39:53.798
where the two worlds touch.

39:53.800 --> 39:58.471
The door is round and open,
don't go back to sleep."

40:00.974 --> 40:02.708
Who's Rumi?

40:04.877 --> 40:08.078
- He was a poet.
- Is he still alive?

40:08.080 --> 40:11.317
No. He died a long time ago.

40:20.593 --> 40:24.564
Well, I hope you like beans.

40:25.531 --> 40:27.500
Hmm, could be worse, right?

40:33.406 --> 40:35.742
So what's your story?

40:43.050 --> 40:45.583
- It's OK, I...
- No, it's not you. It's...

40:45.585 --> 40:50.922
I haven't had many conversations
in the last three months, so...

40:50.924 --> 40:55.528
I'm British Army, actually,
stationed out in Lympstone.

40:56.596 --> 40:59.998
I was on leave.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.968
I'd just, just got married.

41:02.970 --> 41:08.907
Then I was emergency recalled
to my base.

41:08.909 --> 41:11.843
Time I got there,
all hell had broken loose

41:11.845 --> 41:13.945
and nobody was there.

41:13.947 --> 41:17.849
So I just spent the last three
months heading back here to...

41:17.851 --> 41:19.753
try and find my wife.

41:22.589 --> 41:24.992
I saw the kids and here we are.

41:27.094 --> 41:29.830
Did you find your wife?

41:30.898 --> 41:32.032
No.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.501
I'm sorry.

41:37.872 --> 41:39.070
What about you?

41:39.072 --> 41:41.673
Oh, I teach.

41:41.675 --> 41:46.745
Taught. Electromagnetics at
a university not far from here.

41:46.747 --> 41:49.048
We were monitoring
routine collision data

41:49.050 --> 41:52.784
through from CERN.
Nothing special. Yeah.

41:52.786 --> 41:55.856
Usual night shift for me,
given I had no social life.

41:57.091 --> 41:59.125
I went to the bathroom
and when I came back,

41:59.127 --> 42:03.094
everyone had disappeared
and all the equipment was dead.

42:03.096 --> 42:05.630
The only clue was a print-out

42:05.632 --> 42:09.137
which showed a huge spike
just before everything stopped.

42:15.208 --> 42:17.108
It's the...
What is this all about, here?

42:17.110 --> 42:20.947
Oh, uh, random output noise
from the spike.

42:20.949 --> 42:22.748
So this is from CERN?

42:22.750 --> 42:24.917
- Hadron Collider, right?
- Yeah.

42:24.919 --> 42:29.055
Something happened there
and now most of us are gone.

42:29.057 --> 42:32.091
And at the same time, something
else has come into our world

42:32.093 --> 42:35.194
that seems pretty intent
in finishing off the rest of us.

42:35.196 --> 42:38.831
Whatever it is,
it's drawn to artificial sound.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.767
That's why
the cities went first.

42:41.903 --> 42:45.104
When you say "it",

42:45.106 --> 42:47.942
you're speaking about
the wind, right?

42:50.079 --> 42:51.212
Yeah.

42:53.580 --> 42:56.916
"But when he saw the wind,
he was afraid.

42:56.918 --> 42:59.053
He cried out, 'Lord, save me!'"

43:01.190 --> 43:03.889
- What's that? The Bible?
- It is.

43:03.891 --> 43:06.661
So you think
this is an act of God?

43:07.662 --> 43:08.796
Maybe.

43:09.697 --> 43:11.233
Truthfully, I don't know.

43:13.135 --> 43:15.735
Are you Christian?

43:15.737 --> 43:17.970
Aren't you supposed to be
a pacifist?

43:17.972 --> 43:19.572
"Thou shalt not kill,"
and all that.

43:19.574 --> 43:21.141
Yeah.

43:21.143 --> 43:23.110
Times like this,
it gets complicated, right?

43:23.112 --> 43:26.015
It's pretty simple now,
there's no one left.

43:29.217 --> 43:31.817
How did you make it out alive?

43:31.819 --> 43:37.860
That night, I was taking
a cold shower to wake myself up.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.361
The water around me
and in the pipes...

43:41.363 --> 43:43.330
I guess it all added up.

43:43.332 --> 43:45.664
But I thought it was just
large bodies of water

43:45.666 --> 43:46.466
that repelled the wind?

43:46.468 --> 43:48.902
Smaller, geometric
configurations

43:48.904 --> 43:51.371
seem to work sometimes,
sometimes not.

43:51.373 --> 43:53.140
It's like the rain.

43:53.142 --> 43:57.177
It doesn't do much
but slow it down. It's weird.

43:57.179 --> 43:59.346
I mean,
we're mostly water, right?

43:59.348 --> 44:00.983
I don't make the rules.

44:02.385 --> 44:04.384
I was on my way
to a former professor's place

44:04.386 --> 44:06.319
not far from here
and I got caught short

44:06.321 --> 44:07.720
and the rest, you know.

44:07.722 --> 44:09.689
And what's at
your professor's place?

44:09.691 --> 44:13.361
Equipment that still works.
I hope.

44:13.363 --> 44:15.795
Anything that was running
at the time of the event

44:15.797 --> 44:18.865
- is permanently dead.
- You have any theories?

44:18.867 --> 44:22.202
Theories? Oh, yeah.

44:22.204 --> 44:24.673
A way to prove them? No.

44:26.342 --> 44:27.974
Until now.

44:27.976 --> 44:30.077
The boy?

44:30.079 --> 44:32.412
You see the way
he used that scanner.

44:32.414 --> 44:35.082
The effect it had on the wind.

44:35.084 --> 44:36.783
Stopped it in its tracks.

44:36.785 --> 44:38.785
If we can replicate that,
we've got a way

44:38.787 --> 44:41.254
of protecting ourselves, while
we try and figure this out.

44:41.256 --> 44:45.426
- Maybe even reverse it.
- That kit he has.

44:45.428 --> 44:48.229
I'd say, in my opinion,
it's military.

44:48.231 --> 44:51.665
Build quality, all of it.

44:51.667 --> 44:54.069
But I've never seen
anything like it.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.173
We should bring him down here.

45:08.851 --> 45:11.685
Sira...

45:11.687 --> 45:15.023
That scanner you used out there,
where did you get it?

45:16.191 --> 45:18.259
My mother gave it to me.

45:18.261 --> 45:20.029
Where did she get it?

45:21.231 --> 45:22.866
I don't know.

45:25.835 --> 45:27.403
Can I take a look?

45:49.360 --> 45:51.359
What did your mum do?

45:51.361 --> 45:53.263
She worked for the government.

45:55.165 --> 45:58.099
What did she do for them?

45:58.101 --> 46:02.003
I'm not sure. She didn't really
like to talk about her work.

46:02.005 --> 46:03.839
Where is she now?

46:11.448 --> 46:12.982
Gone.

46:17.387 --> 46:20.190
I'm so... I'm sorry.

46:28.064 --> 46:30.200
How did you deflect the wind?

46:32.035 --> 46:36.238
Well, in my mind,
I make the blue and green lines

46:36.240 --> 46:40.743
the same as the red
and well, the wind just stops.

46:41.512 --> 46:44.213
Can I ask you, did you, um...

46:44.215 --> 46:47.384
Did your mother
show you how to do that?

46:48.452 --> 46:50.054
Yeah.

46:52.121 --> 46:55.125
- But how did she know?
- I'm not sure.

46:58.896 --> 47:00.030
OK.

47:03.534 --> 47:06.103
Do you mind if I ask
where you two are headed?

47:09.139 --> 47:10.973
To the place that grants wishes.

47:10.975 --> 47:14.078
- Wishes?
- And what happens there?

47:15.179 --> 47:16.813
You make a wish.

47:18.282 --> 47:20.084
And it comes true?

47:21.218 --> 47:22.853
Yep.

47:24.489 --> 47:27.888
- Where is this place?
- I'll show you.

47:27.890 --> 47:30.192
- Sira!
- It's OK.

47:30.194 --> 47:32.229
You can trust us.

47:36.301 --> 47:41.303
We're here. And...
This is the place.

47:41.305 --> 47:43.472
Did you make this?

47:43.474 --> 47:46.110
No, my mother did.

47:47.945 --> 47:51.181
Can I ask how your mother knew
where this place was?

47:51.882 --> 47:53.350
I don't know.

47:54.218 --> 47:55.919
Thank you, Sira.

48:02.227 --> 48:05.561
My mother told me to stay away
from people in uniforms.

48:05.563 --> 48:08.098
Especially soldiers.

48:18.208 --> 48:23.181
Well, uh, I'd say your mother
gave you good advice, Sira.

48:24.949 --> 48:26.984
Have you ever killed someone?

48:30.255 --> 48:31.589
I have.

48:33.391 --> 48:34.526
Why?

48:38.296 --> 48:39.397
I don't know.

48:43.301 --> 48:49.207
You two must be tired, hmm?
You go and get some rest.

49:31.116 --> 49:33.017
So what do you make of all this?

49:36.222 --> 49:39.088
There's something in
what the boy is saying.

49:39.090 --> 49:41.290
This place
they're travelling to,

49:41.292 --> 49:43.293
I've heard reports
of places like it,

49:43.295 --> 49:45.564
where wishes are fulfilled.

49:46.198 --> 49:47.299
Wishes?

49:48.601 --> 49:50.667
Do you believe that?

49:50.669 --> 49:54.203
Our world is upside down.

49:54.205 --> 49:57.074
I have no rational basis
upon which to deny or accept it.

49:57.076 --> 50:00.043
All I know
is that the boy believes it

50:00.045 --> 50:04.213
and he has demonstrated a power
that we need to survive.

50:04.215 --> 50:07.451
That's why
we've got to protect him.

50:07.453 --> 50:11.157
- Spoken like a true soldier.
- No, it's not that.

50:13.292 --> 50:15.126
He's just a young boy.

50:17.028 --> 50:18.362
With what he's shown us
he can do,

50:18.364 --> 50:21.198
he could be exploited.
I mean, he's valuable.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.636
- And not just to us.
- And where will you take him?

50:24.638 --> 50:27.571
Army base? None of those left.

50:27.573 --> 50:29.475
I don't know, Jesse.

50:32.511 --> 50:35.212
The scanners,
you think about it...

50:35.214 --> 50:37.749
Where there's one,
there must be more, right?

50:37.751 --> 50:40.451
Maybe he can teach us how
to use them, protect ourselves.

50:40.453 --> 50:42.254
Maybe even protect other people.

50:43.522 --> 50:47.090
You're curious about this place.

50:47.092 --> 50:50.061
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get my head around it.

50:50.063 --> 50:52.596
So what if his mother is right
about this place?

50:52.598 --> 50:54.298
That what you wish for
came true.

50:54.300 --> 50:57.267
Surely someone
would've wished for this wind

50:57.269 --> 50:59.304
to stop doing
whatever it's doing.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.606
I don't know. Worth a trip
to find out, though.

51:02.608 --> 51:06.613
I mean, unless you've
got something better to do?

51:10.283 --> 51:12.319
Do you think
they'll come with us?

51:13.753 --> 51:15.620
I don't know.

51:15.622 --> 51:18.492
Do you think they have wishes
they want to come true?

51:19.493 --> 51:21.659
Well, probably.

51:21.661 --> 51:24.596
What if the wish only comes true
for you because you're special?

51:24.598 --> 51:26.465
I don't know, Lilly.

51:28.367 --> 51:30.468
OK, then.

51:30.470 --> 51:33.507
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Lilly.

51:35.075 --> 51:36.677
You believe the boy.

51:38.545 --> 51:40.612
I was never one for fairy tales.

51:40.614 --> 51:44.349
The way I see it,
this place, if it does exist,

51:44.351 --> 51:47.620
is another anomaly
and one I can learn from.

51:47.622 --> 51:50.356
What, research? With what?
We've got no equipment, nothing.

51:50.358 --> 51:52.423
My professor's place
is not far from here.

51:52.425 --> 51:55.560
I'm hoping he'll have
what I'm looking for.

51:55.562 --> 51:57.529
Yeah, I saw where
that place is on the map too.

51:57.531 --> 52:01.199
Landlocked,
no large bodies of water,

52:01.201 --> 52:03.434
which means no protection
for any of us.

52:03.436 --> 52:06.771
And if memory serves me correct,
the route from the army base

52:06.773 --> 52:09.173
on the coast to here doesn't
have a whole lot of water,

52:09.175 --> 52:11.812
so how did you do it, Jay?

52:13.614 --> 52:15.780
Training.

52:15.782 --> 52:20.186
Trained to be silent,
attuned to our environment.

52:22.623 --> 52:25.758
I learnt that I could sense when
the wind was getting close.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.193
- How?
- Change in air pressure,

52:29.195 --> 52:30.831
background noise.

52:33.367 --> 52:35.336
Caught me off guard sometimes.

52:36.904 --> 52:39.137
Used the rifle and suppressor.

52:39.139 --> 52:41.239
Throw sound, hit a target,
make some noise,

52:41.241 --> 52:42.875
the wind would hear it,
go towards the sound,

52:42.877 --> 52:47.446
and I would...
I would slip away.

52:47.448 --> 52:49.751
That's what
you were doing out there.

52:50.818 --> 52:52.419
In the field.

52:55.221 --> 52:57.156
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52:57.158 --> 53:00.392
Well, you know, the wind
did get pretty close to you.

53:00.394 --> 53:02.561
- That's quite smart.
- Well, yeah, maybe.

53:02.563 --> 53:04.463
Well, until I tried to outrun it
in a Jeep,

53:04.465 --> 53:06.932
which actually
didn't end so well.

53:06.934 --> 53:10.804
- Still, you're here, so...
- Barely.

53:10.806 --> 53:14.173
What about you?
How did you survive so long?

53:14.175 --> 53:17.776
Well, blind luck mostly...

53:17.778 --> 53:20.815
which run out just before
our boy intervened.

53:22.216 --> 53:24.584
The way I see it,
with you and Sira,

53:24.586 --> 53:26.621
we should be in safe hands.

53:39.900 --> 53:41.435
OK, Jesse.

53:44.472 --> 53:48.443
OK. Count me in.

53:53.481 --> 53:55.314
Then that's settled.

53:55.316 --> 53:57.617
We head off early,
go the professor's place,

53:57.619 --> 53:59.721
- pick up what we need...
- Shh.

54:57.814 --> 54:59.214
It's leaving.

55:06.788 --> 55:07.924
OK.

56:35.112 --> 56:36.912
How are they?

56:36.914 --> 56:38.048
They're fine.

56:38.948 --> 56:41.818
Good... good.

56:44.420 --> 56:46.389
You should get some rest.

56:47.524 --> 56:51.327
Yeah, I will. You too.

57:47.919 --> 57:50.085
Jay and I
had a long talk last night

57:50.087 --> 57:52.489
and we would both like
to come with you to this place.

57:54.925 --> 57:56.060
OK.

57:57.161 --> 58:00.863
- Lilly?
- Sira said OK.

58:00.865 --> 58:02.597
But we do need to make a detour.

58:02.599 --> 58:05.569
- How far?
- I can show you on your map.

58:17.581 --> 58:20.950
No, no, no.
That's too close to the city.

58:20.952 --> 58:23.719
What difference does that make?
The cities are dead.

58:23.721 --> 58:27.123
The wind hides in the cities.
It's where it sleeps.

58:27.125 --> 58:31.559
But we have you and your scanner
and we'll be extra careful.

58:31.561 --> 58:34.964
No, my scanner can't detect
the wind if it's sleeping.

58:34.966 --> 58:38.600
- Only if it's awake.
- Sira, listen.

58:38.602 --> 58:41.904
We understand why you're afraid
to go to the city, we really do.

58:41.906 --> 58:44.040
And you're right,
it's dangerous. Very dangerous.

58:44.042 --> 58:45.942
We're not gonna lie to you,
but I can hear it,

58:45.944 --> 58:48.044
I can divert it,
I've done it before.

58:48.046 --> 58:49.914
Why do you need to go there?

58:53.151 --> 58:56.852
I think,
with the right equipment...

58:56.854 --> 58:59.855
we may be able to find out
how you do what you do

58:59.857 --> 59:03.059
and then make a machine do it,
so you don't have to.

59:03.061 --> 59:05.129
You could do it for all of us?

59:06.631 --> 59:07.964
I guess...

59:07.966 --> 59:12.803
OK, then. We'll go.
Get the equipment.

59:12.805 --> 59:15.237
- No!
- Why?

59:15.239 --> 59:17.306
I told you, it's too dangerous.

59:17.308 --> 59:20.076
But Jay can help us
and you can keep us safe.

59:20.078 --> 59:23.648
- Not in the city, Lilly.
- Well, I'm going.

59:27.719 --> 59:28.853
Fine.

59:31.256 --> 59:32.890
Sira?

59:33.691 --> 59:34.960
Sira.

59:36.795 --> 59:39.197
Sira, you need to think about
all of us from now on.

59:42.033 --> 59:43.202
Sira.

59:50.309 --> 59:51.642
Now what?

01:00:06.058 --> 01:00:09.228
Jesse, Jesse!

01:00:11.997 --> 01:00:14.264
What are you thinking?

01:00:14.266 --> 01:00:18.869
- We can't just leave him.
- I think he's leaving us.

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:22.105
- It has to be his decision.
- No.

01:00:22.107 --> 01:00:23.542
We have to be the adults here.

01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:15.192
There it is.

01:01:15.194 --> 01:01:18.929
- That's where he lives?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.931 --> 01:01:20.834
It's a big place.

01:01:22.735 --> 01:01:25.138
Got a problem with big places?

01:01:26.439 --> 01:01:27.773
Let's go.

01:02:20.059 --> 01:02:22.294
What's wrong?

01:02:22.296 --> 01:02:25.130
- I'm not going in there.
- Me neither.

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.400
You gonna be OK out here?

01:02:31.172 --> 01:02:32.306
OK.

01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:39.712
Now what?

01:02:41.114 --> 01:02:42.815
We wait outside.

01:03:50.351 --> 01:03:51.885
Marcus?

01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.525
Marcus?

01:04:45.473 --> 01:04:47.476
Is that him?

01:04:49.943 --> 01:04:51.546
Downstairs, you think?

01:04:55.383 --> 01:04:58.987
Marcus, you idiot!

01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:02.424
I'm sorry.

01:05:20.075 --> 01:05:21.310
Scanners.

01:05:31.554 --> 01:05:32.987
It works.

01:05:36.158 --> 01:05:38.159
So what is all this stuff?

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:44.198
Particle and quantum physics.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.069
A lot of it's analysis
of CERN data, but...

01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:51.474
most of it's beyond me.

01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:55.411
<i>Is that your mum?</i>

01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:59.281
- Yeah.
- She's pretty.

01:06:03.486 --> 01:06:06.220
She looks sad.

01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:08.424
She didn't want
to leave me on my own.

01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:11.160
You're not on your own.

01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:20.567
- What about your mum?
- She died when I was little.

01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:23.103
My pappa brought me up.

01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:25.074
Don't know where he is now.

01:06:26.975 --> 01:06:30.413
- Have you got a picture?
- No.

01:06:35.285 --> 01:06:38.287
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:06:39.688 --> 01:06:41.490
We're in business.

01:06:51.367 --> 01:06:54.437
Turn it off now, turn it off!
Get your things. We're leaving.

01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:56.673
Not without this.

01:07:09.219 --> 01:07:10.353
Run!

01:08:32.703 --> 01:08:34.604
We shouldn't have come here.

01:09:57.689 --> 01:09:59.424
I'm gonna go speak to him.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.235
Sira.

01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:16.508
I'm sorry.

01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:21.613
Sorry we didn't listen to you.

01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:25.483
And I truly wish
she was still here.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:30.889
You're a brave boy.

01:10:33.392 --> 01:10:34.894
I'm glad you're with us.

01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:41.233
Get some rest.

01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:06.959
Was it worth it?

01:11:12.031 --> 01:11:13.965
That's not fair.

01:11:19.872 --> 01:11:21.541
I'm sorry.

01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:34.554
I think it can replicate
what he can do.

01:11:36.622 --> 01:11:39.890
I need to calibrate it
so it deflects

01:11:39.892 --> 01:11:41.928
instead of attracts the wind.

01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:44.630
How?

01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:51.269
I'll do it the next time
he does his thing.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.773
Will that work?

01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:56.709
I'm not sure.

01:11:58.544 --> 01:12:01.546
I'm not sure of anything
any more.

01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:07.487
How much further?

01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:13.693
According to his map,
it's still half a day away.

01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:17.430
What do you think
he'll wish for?

01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:20.968
I think it's obvious.

01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:23.570
I don't know.

01:12:24.805 --> 01:12:26.305
What about you?

01:12:29.575 --> 01:12:31.744
For everything to be as it was.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:34.615
Right.

01:12:37.884 --> 01:12:39.952
Why, what's wrong with that?

01:12:43.757 --> 01:12:45.458
Look around, Jess.

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:51.864
The world seems like it's doing
pretty good without us.

01:12:54.367 --> 01:12:58.537
So what, we just give up, yeah?

01:12:58.539 --> 01:12:59.938
Return to the Garden of Eden,

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.507
but this there's time no
Adam and Eve to mess things up?

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:05.311
Would that be so bad?

01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:11.083
Out there... the world.

01:13:11.085 --> 01:13:13.553
What's so broken
that needs fixing?

01:13:14.554 --> 01:13:16.223
I want to survive.

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:22.396
Yeah, of course.

01:13:23.764 --> 01:13:24.899
Of course.

01:13:27.466 --> 01:13:30.103
Hey, Jesse, it's OK.

01:13:31.138 --> 01:13:32.439
It's OK.

01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:37.476
Get some rest, eh?
We have a long day tomorrow.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.588
Copy that.

01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:11.112
Rested?

01:14:15.883 --> 01:14:18.019
We thought we'd lost you
for a second.

01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:28.428
Come on.

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:37.465
We need to get out of here,
come on.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.172
Wait.

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.608
It's not attacking.

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.213
It's going across,
it's not attacking.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.017
I've never seen it
do this before.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.034
My God.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.173
It can't be.

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.544
Who is it, Jay?

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.513
My wife.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.925
It's my wife.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.271
I can get you through.

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.874
You're going in?

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.144
I am.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.248
Let me set up first.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.189
Jesse...

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.858
Hurry, Jesse.

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.866
You nod as soon as you're ready.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.179
I'm ready.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.319
Go.

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:07.384
Jay! Run!

01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:13.049
Sira! Sira, wake up.

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:16.387
Are you OK?

01:19:20.357 --> 01:19:22.193
Where's Jay?

01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.196
He's gone.

01:19:43.247 --> 01:19:45.015
Who is it?

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:47.352
It's my mother.

01:19:48.019 --> 01:19:49.720
It's my mother.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:57.493
Sira, no. You can't go.
You saw what happened to Jay.

01:19:57.495 --> 01:19:59.297
- Sira, no.
- I'm going.

01:20:00.198 --> 01:20:01.832
Will you help me?

01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:05.370
Will you help me?

01:20:20.585 --> 01:20:24.356
- Sira, your scanner.
- I don't need it.

01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:47.178
Sira!

01:20:50.048 --> 01:20:52.949
<i>"The breezes at dawn
have secrets to tell you,</i>

01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:55.251
<i>don't go back to sleep.</i>

01:20:55.253 --> 01:20:58.087
<i>You must ask
for what you really want,</i>

01:20:58.089 --> 01:21:00.025
<i>don't go back to sleep."</i>

01:21:08.434 --> 01:21:09.834
Oh, no.

01:21:13.204 --> 01:21:15.273
She was my wish.

01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:45.971
You have to decide.

01:21:47.907 --> 01:21:49.506
I can't.

01:21:49.508 --> 01:21:51.377
Follow your heart.

01:21:55.648 --> 01:21:57.850
We don't have much time.

01:22:01.052 --> 01:22:03.289
It's breaking down!

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:39.957
"People are going back and forth

01:22:39.959 --> 01:22:43.028
across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch.

01:22:44.196 --> 01:22:46.199
The door is round and open,

01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.102
don't go back to sleep."

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:40.253
Are you OK?

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:42.389
You saved Lilly.

01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:45.125
You did good.

01:23:53.099 --> 01:23:55.033
What's that?

01:23:55.035 --> 01:23:56.802
It's a letter from my mum.

01:23:56.804 --> 01:23:59.474
It was just over there
in the grass.

01:24:01.508 --> 01:24:03.109
Shall we open it?

01:24:15.188 --> 01:24:16.691
It's another map.

01:24:35.476 --> 01:24:37.077
This can't be...

01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.581
I know where this is.

01:24:45.386 --> 01:24:47.186
What do you think?

01:24:47.188 --> 01:24:48.623
I think we go.

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:51.726
It's a long way.

01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.263
It's OK.

01:24:57.164 --> 01:24:58.700
It's been a long way already.
