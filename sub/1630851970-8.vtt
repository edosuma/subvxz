WEBVTT

00:11.637 --> 00:13.180
Stinking sack of shit.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.848
Please don't use language like that.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.433
Please don't fuck your secretary!

00:16.517 --> 00:18.018
Okay, come on. Let's go.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.688
No, I'm not ready.
I still have to rip his head off!

00:21.772 --> 00:23.774
No, not now. We have a long way to go.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.568
Daniel, in the interest of time,
maybe you could rip your own head off.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.111
Fuck you, Marty.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.030
Please, watch language.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.365
Thank you.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.159
I'm sorry.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.411
I'm so sorry.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.372
There's no need to apologize.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.415
You should've done this years ago.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.716
I am such an idiot.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.260
You're not an idiot.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.929
You're just a schmuck like the rest of us.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.306
Right?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.770
All right, guys,
you ready for an adventure?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
Blast off.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.882
Would anyone like to listen to the radio?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.344
I think I would.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.643
Did you guys know that I officially have
the best singing voice in the world?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.229
Listen.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.773
Oh, no, Uncle Marty.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.193
-Please stop.
-Come on, stop.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.113
-No.
-Uncle Marty, stop.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.489
As voted on by dogs.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.782
-No, Marty.
-Dogs?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.036
Dogs can't even vote!

02:00.662 --> 02:02.998
-My eardrums!
-Want me to go higher? I can go higher.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.751
-Please, just don't sing.
-No, no! Lower.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.880
Okay, someone join me
in the high harmonies here.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.965
-Nancy, come on. You're up.
-Do not--

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
Okay.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.430
You got a regular Linda Ronstadt
back there.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.518
-That's not bad.
-My turn, my turn. I can sing even higher.

02:22.601 --> 02:26.104
That's quite an accusation.
Okay, go ahead. Go for it, big shot.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.400
-That's very high.
-That's very high.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.946
We got the brand-new version
of the von Trapp family singers here.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.241
All we need is a nun and some Nazis.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.326
Let's head for the Alps!

02:39.409 --> 02:40.536
To the Alps!

02:40.619 --> 02:41.620
To the Alps!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.580
-That sound good?
-Yeah.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.082
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.339
-Beautiful. Beautiful singing, everyone.
-Yes.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.342
Lovely. Not as good as me.
Not as good as me.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.345
I think this road goes to the Alps.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.777
You have one old message.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.613
Hi, Marty. It's Ike.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.740
I understand your boundary at AFC.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.911
Just confirming you still want to continue
as doctor and patient

04:03.994 --> 04:06.663
and that you'll be attending
your appointment at 11:15.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.588
You have one old message.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.423
Hi, Marty. It's Ike.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.716
I understand your boundary at AFC.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.846
Just confirming you still want to continue
as doctor and patient

04:22.930 --> 04:25.641
and that you'll be attending
your appointment at 11:15.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.911
Hey, Bruce. You have lunch plans?

04:47.663 --> 04:50.207
You wanna go eat lunch?
You wanna get something to eat?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.460
I found a great place nearby if you--
You wanna tag along?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.757
-Now? Or--
-Yeah. If you want.

04:58.841 --> 04:59.842
My treat.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.679
So, this is
Puerto Rican street food, okay?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.681
Pretty authentic. The locals swear by it.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.766
Hope you have
a strong constitution, Bruce.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.601
Hola, hola. Welcome to Hanguiar.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.769
Thank you for having us.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.147
-Give me the tripletas.
-Tripletas.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.441
But I wanna make
some changes on it, all right?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.735
Instead of beef, I just want plain turkey.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.239
No pepper, no tomato, no cheese, no onion.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.366
A single slice of lettuce,

05:24.449 --> 05:28.745
and a little dab, just a whisper,
of mayonnaise on a plain roll.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.664
Right, so you just want a turkey sandwich?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.748
Sí.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.667
-Turkey sandwich.
-Thank you. Yeah.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.169
Bruce, what'll you have?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.420
I--

05:37.171 --> 05:38.172
I'll have soup.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.675
Come on, Bruce.
Live a little. Be decisive.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.760
I am. I decide soup.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.513
Just shout it out, first thing
that comes into your head.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.056
What do you really want?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.850
-I want soup.
-You're missing out.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.311
I suspect you miss out on a lot,
don't you?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.354
Not really. I was here like an hour ago.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.690
I got the empanada de pollo,
plátanos fritos,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.483
churros, and a cup of horchata. So…

06:00.402 --> 06:01.904
Right.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.448
This is good.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.909
This is nice, just you and me.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.662
-Uh-huh.
-Talking, not talking.

06:10.746 --> 06:14.625
Just hanging out, you know,
with people who know you.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.793
People you can say anything to.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.632
We have that. Right?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.134
Sure. Yeah.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.512
It's important.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.808
Can I ask you a question?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.769
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. Anything.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.565
You seen Phyllis recently, or…

06:39.775 --> 06:43.403
No. No, it's been a while.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.948
You?

06:46.031 --> 06:49.535
She sends me,
you know, birthday cards every year.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.036
-That's nice. Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.747
How long since you spoke to her?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.791
It's been…

06:56.792 --> 06:58.418
It's been 27 years.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.295
Jeez.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.257
Yeah, one…

07:05.425 --> 07:08.512
Few years ago,
I looked her up in the phone book.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.140
It was nice just to see her name.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
Hey, here's a thought.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.692
You wanna hang out tonight?

07:21.775 --> 07:25.863
-We could go see a show or--
-I gotta get home.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.658
We're…
We're babysitting the granddaughter.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.743
Right. Right, of course.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.622
-Yeah. So, some other time, yeah?
-Yeah.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.584
-All right. Yeah.
-Yeah, no, of course. Yeah.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.587
-Hey, thanks for the soup.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.962
Hello?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.508
Hello?
Are you gonna start speaking, please?

08:32.846 --> 08:33.847
This is--

08:34.431 --> 08:37.768
-This is Ma-- Marshall Feldhammer.
-Never heard of you.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.895
Hello?

08:40.979 --> 08:44.358
Yes, I'm calling about Marty.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.443
Oh, God.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.571
Oh, God, is he dead? He's dead, isn't he?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.242
-Oh, God.
-No. No, no, no. No. No.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.368
No, he's not dead.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.831
Okay, well, what does he want? A kidney?

09:00.666 --> 09:01.792
No.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.293
Okay, well, I--

09:03.377 --> 09:05.712
You tell him, whatever he wants,
he's not gonna get it.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.799
He's not getting a kidney.
He's not gonna get a drop of my blood.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.566
You have one old message.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.317
Hi, Marty. It's Ike.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.528
I understand your boundary at AFC.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.824
Just confirming you still want to continue
as doctor and patient

09:33.907 --> 09:36.618
and that you'll be attending
your appointment at 11:15.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.133
There he is.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.970
I am very, very,

09:55.679 --> 09:58.348
very proud of you, Marty.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.310
Do you even realize
how incredible this is?

10:01.393 --> 10:05.063
You found your voice. Your strength.

10:05.731 --> 10:06.732
Come on.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.030
I must admit,
it took longer than I thought,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.365
but you have emerged.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.786
Yeah, have a seat.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.715
You stood up to me, Marty,
put me in my place.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.800
And it's left me thinking.

10:34.384 --> 10:40.224
Doctors, therapists, we…
We learn lessons too.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.767
And you taught me one.

10:42.976 --> 10:47.231
You taught me
that this is what I love. This.

10:47.898 --> 10:51.026
I'm through with industrial psychology.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.071
I'm not a money guy. I'm a people guy.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.157
I see how much I've helped you,
and I want to continue that.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.788
That's why I'd like to go back
to the way it was before.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.542
Doctor and patient.

11:07.960 --> 11:13.632
I want to dedicate myself to being
the very best therapist that I can be.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.718
But enough about me. Tell me about you.

11:16.802 --> 11:17.928
How are you?

11:19.888 --> 11:22.850
I'm… I'm fine, I guess.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.434
There's that word again.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.562
I see we have a little more work to do.

11:29.022 --> 11:33.068
You know, Marty,
every relationship has its ups and downs.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.321
But if there's a foundation
of love and respect,

11:36.405 --> 11:37.698
you can weather any storm.

11:38.699 --> 11:43.328
That said, sometimes it's good
to reaffirm that love and respect.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.039
And that is why

11:47.374 --> 11:49.293
Bonnie and I are renewing our vows.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.088
Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.

11:53.172 --> 11:54.882
We talked about it,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.634
and we both decided
there could only be one person

11:58.552 --> 12:00.762
who could possibly be our best man.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.308
-You.
-Me?

12:05.309 --> 12:06.310
I don't know.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.936
You must.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.857
You're so important to me, to both of us.
So beloved.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.902
-That's very nice of you to say, but--
-It would mean so much to me.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.112
What do you say?

12:19.072 --> 12:23.202
Would you do me the honor
of being my best man?

12:28.540 --> 12:29.958
Sure, why not?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.393
-Hey--
-Hey.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.778
Nancy?

13:04.159 --> 13:05.410
Have a seat.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.379
Wow, you're like a grown woman.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.381
Who'd have thought?

13:18.257 --> 13:21.552
Bruce helped me track you down
on Facebook.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.136
If you were wondering.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.305
-Bruce at the office.
-Yeah, you mentioned.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.436
So, why am I here?
What do you want to say?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.689
Just wanted to talk. I wanna-- Well, I--

13:34.439 --> 13:36.733
What I wanted to say is that…

13:39.194 --> 13:40.195
I miss you.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.198
I miss your mom. I miss all of you.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.159
Yeah, you should miss us.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.580
We're pretty great,
and you've been gone our entire lives.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.835
Yeah. No, that's true. Yeah.

13:57.921 --> 14:01.675
The last time I saw you, you were…

14:02.259 --> 14:06.138
You were crazy about those--
What were they called?

14:06.221 --> 14:07.222
I don't know.

14:07.306 --> 14:10.976
You were collecting
all the plastic figures from McDonald's.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.313
Did you ever get the last one
to complete the set?

14:14.396 --> 14:15.981
-A Hamburglar?
-Uh-huh.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.692
No. No, I did not.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.570
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.738
I'm over it.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.574
-Of course. Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.160
You were just a child. Yeah.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.707
-Bruce tells me you're a lawyer?
-That's right.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.168
Wow.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.795
I'm so impressed. I'm so proud.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.340
You don't get to be proud.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
-Right.
-For some crazy reason,

14:46.470 --> 14:48.722
I thought you had asked me here
to apologize.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.184
-I don't know what I was thinking.
-Wait, Nancy, please.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.521
No, I've been waiting for almost 30 years.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.524
I don't want to see you again, Marty.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.526
And neither does my mom.

15:14.373 --> 15:15.499
You know what?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.751
I've been thinking.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.635
You know what I've been thinking?

15:27.344 --> 15:28.345
No.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.931
We should renew our wedding vows.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.015
What?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.561
-I think we should renew our wedding vows.
-Why?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.105
Maybe the question is, why not?

15:38.188 --> 15:40.399
Well, there's a bunch of reasons.

15:40.482 --> 15:44.236
-Such as?
-Such as, Isaac, be honest.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.488
I barely see you. You're never here.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.365
We haven't slept in the same room since--

15:48.448 --> 15:51.076
Okay, all right, all right. I know.
Spare me the details.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.621
What exactly do you think
renewing our vows is going to achieve?

15:55.247 --> 15:57.374
Are you just looking
to have another party?

16:00.836 --> 16:03.547
No, something is going on with Marty.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.675
Well, you know,
some relationships run their course.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.094
-Don't talk like that.
-But it's true.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.471
Maybe you should just walk away.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.557
I don't want to walk away.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.977
-I've done nothing wrong.
-But it's not normal.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.063
No-- "Not normal." Not norm--

16:20.147 --> 16:23.025
You know what?
There's no such thing as normal.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.277
I've been a psychiatrist for 30 years,

16:25.360 --> 16:27.112
and I can tell you that for a fact.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.989
There is no such thing as normal.

16:29.072 --> 16:33.911
Okay, but I worry about…
certain aspects of this.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.454
We have done nothing wrong.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.831
He invited us.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.250
He wanted us to sleep
in the master bedroom.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.462
He wanted us there. Okay?

16:43.545 --> 16:46.089
We gave him everything.
We gave him a family.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.718
I need this wedding.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.389
We need this wedding.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.186
Fine.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.524
Fine? Or "I do"?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.075
Are you touching my breast?

17:14.826 --> 17:16.787
Would it be a problem if I was?

17:16.869 --> 17:20.915
It's just-- It's 9:00 p.m.
I have a 20/20 DVR'ed in my room.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.712
Okay.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.214
Sure.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.323
Hello?

17:58.412 --> 17:59.830
-Hey.
-Marty.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.541
-Wow, long time, no see.
-Hey, Joe. How you doing?

18:02.624 --> 18:05.252
You know, they thought I had ball cancer.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.755
Turned out to be
an undeveloped ovary on my testicle.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.299
Yeah, it was in all the journals.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.134
Congratulations.

18:12.217 --> 18:15.053
Anyway, you got something for me?
What can I do for ya?

18:16.096 --> 18:18.265
Actually, I was hoping to speak to Hannah.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.560
Hannah hasn't worked here in a long time.

18:21.643 --> 18:25.689
Right. Would you happen to have
a number I could phone her on?

18:25.772 --> 18:30.068
I guess.
You know, she's married with kids now.

18:31.445 --> 18:32.613
Wow.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.910
Yeah, I just wanted to check in.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.037
See how she was doing.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.622
You know, I know it sounds crazy,

18:41.705 --> 18:45.584
but I always wondered why
she didn't return my calls after our date.

18:46.210 --> 18:49.046
Marty, it's been a long time,
but you know that isn't what happened.

18:49.630 --> 18:50.631
What do you mean?

18:50.714 --> 18:53.217
Well, Dr. Herschkopf came in here,
gave her a whole spiel.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.635
He did what?

18:54.718 --> 18:57.012
He said that you asked him
to have a word with her.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.348
No, no, I didn't.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.350
Well, I did, but I thought--

19:01.433 --> 19:03.644
She was pretty upset, the way I remember.

19:08.482 --> 19:09.858
All right, well…

19:11.068 --> 19:12.819
Yeah, nice seeing you.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.712
I can't take the call right now.
You know what to do.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.551
I just called to say…

19:39.471 --> 19:43.475
that I can't be your best man
due to a prior engagement.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.363
Just to be clear,
all of these are new locks?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.574
None of the old keys will work
on them, right?

19:58.657 --> 19:59.867
That's correct.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.369
You know, maybe you could add
a-- another lock.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.788
Just in case someone tries to use force.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.623
-Is that-- Yeah?
-Sure.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.333
-Is that possible?
-Absolutely.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.585
Don't worry, buddy,

20:09.668 --> 20:12.629
I've done this for many people before
when the relationship goes south.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.047
Yeah, it's complicated.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.634
You ate the whole cucumber already?

20:17.718 --> 20:21.597
You guys. I can't keep up
with your cucumber demands.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.877
Marty? Are you in there?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.631
Marty, open the door right now.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.592
I can see your face. Jesus.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.597
How dare you go anywhere near my daughter?

21:04.848 --> 21:06.767
-I just wanted to see her.
-What?

21:07.559 --> 21:09.645
-I wanted to s--
-I can't hear a word you're saying.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.605
Just open the door.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.902
-What?
-I just wanted to see her, to see you.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.488
You don't get to just come back
into my life like that,

21:19.571 --> 21:21.198
like a fucking zombie.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.282
I killed you.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.993
You're not getting any of our kidneys.

21:25.077 --> 21:28.830
I don't want your kidneys.
I just-- I want you back.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.332
You don't get it, Marty.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
You are dead to me.

21:31.792 --> 21:32.876
Please.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.380
And I can't have you resurrecting yourself
to my children, do you hear me?

21:37.089 --> 21:40.300
-Don't talk like that.
-Leave us alone.

21:40.884 --> 21:41.885
Phyllis.

21:42.553 --> 21:44.721
I never wanna hear from you again.

21:45.722 --> 21:46.723
Okay.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.018
Okay.

21:54.189 --> 21:57.276
Sorry, I just gotta use your bathroom,
'cause it was a long drive.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.360
Please.

22:01.822 --> 22:04.116
What the fuck did you do to our house?

22:04.199 --> 22:06.869
We made a few changes.

22:06.952 --> 22:10.831
Change is a rug. This is insanity.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.545
What happened to our tree?

22:19.089 --> 22:20.465
That's-- Well, it's…

22:22.050 --> 22:23.343
It's no longer here.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.512
-I see that.
-Yeah.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.473
Where is it?

22:29.558 --> 22:30.893
It's a long story.

22:33.604 --> 22:34.605
Try me.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.404
I chopped it down.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.281
Okay.

22:47.034 --> 22:48.493
You'd better start talking.

22:48.994 --> 22:51.622
That way we could combine
the two properties.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.498
Why?

22:53.582 --> 22:55.250
I guess more space.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.503
Well, how much space do you need?

22:57.586 --> 23:00.547
Well, not so much for me,
but we had a lot of parties.

23:00.631 --> 23:03.509
You had parties? You hate parties.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.929
And who are all these people?

23:07.012 --> 23:08.305
Ike's friends.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.015
Bu-- Where are you?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.267
I'm in there. Yeah.

23:12.351 --> 23:13.352
Where?

23:15.729 --> 23:18.482
There's my elbow,
and that's the back of my head.

23:19.566 --> 23:23.153
-"Bonnie's kitchen"? That's ironic.
-I know.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.613
She's not the greatest cook.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.200
And also, it's not her kitchen.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.160
Yeah, yeah, that too.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.084
There's a portrait of them
in your bedroom?

23:37.167 --> 23:38.418
Don't be silly.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.795
They slept here.

23:39.878 --> 23:40.879
Here?

23:41.463 --> 23:42.464
Yes.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.174
-In here?
-Yeah.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.301
-With you?
-No.

23:46.385 --> 23:47.594
Whew! Marty.

23:47.678 --> 23:49.805
-No, I didn't sleep here.
-Where did you sleep?

23:49.888 --> 23:51.723
'Cause this is your bedroom. So I'm conf--

23:51.807 --> 23:53.934
Please, please, please. Educate me.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.936
-Where did you sleep?
-In the guesthouse.

23:56.019 --> 24:00.315
Okay. A, this is terrifying,

24:00.399 --> 24:02.609
and B, I--

24:04.695 --> 24:07.447
Are y-- Are you all right?

24:07.531 --> 24:09.491
I mean, that is an abomination.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.246
Marty. What is that smell?

24:15.414 --> 24:17.457
It's like the gates of hell have
opened up.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.085
The septic tank leaks,

24:20.169 --> 24:22.963
and it kinda seeps out
over near hole number nine.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.214
But you get used to it.

24:26.049 --> 24:29.303
Getting used to it really is
your superpower, huh, Marty?

24:30.596 --> 24:34.141
You'll put up with anything,
even actual shit.

24:34.725 --> 24:35.934
Here we are.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.686
Here's my gang.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.522
"Koiz II Men," I call them.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.400
Originally it was "The Backstreet Kois."

24:45.235 --> 24:46.445
Hi, guys.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.865
I already gave you cucumber.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.034
Yes, I did. Don't try to trick me.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.411
What do you think?

24:56.872 --> 25:01.502
Well, I think they're thriving, clearly.
They're beautiful.

25:01.585 --> 25:02.586
Yeah.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.004
They're very special.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.549
I… I lost one of them recently.

25:11.470 --> 25:12.638
It's pretty difficult.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.057
Sorry to hear that.

25:18.435 --> 25:19.645
Marty.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.982
What the fuck did he do to you?

25:25.776 --> 25:26.777
I don't know.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.404
No one just lets this happen.

25:31.073 --> 25:33.617
No one just gives up their house
like this.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.745
Their-- Their family.

25:37.913 --> 25:39.248
Their life.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.709
How did you do it?

25:43.710 --> 25:44.711
Do what?

25:45.295 --> 25:46.296
Let me go.

25:46.797 --> 25:49.383
You stopped calling. You stopped trying.

25:51.802 --> 25:52.803
How did you do it?

25:52.886 --> 25:54.429
Well, I made you dead to me.

25:55.639 --> 25:56.723
Like you died.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.351
It was the only way.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.021
You left me, Marty.

26:06.233 --> 26:07.651
You left me at my lowest.

26:11.572 --> 26:12.614
I was your sister.

26:12.698 --> 26:13.991
You are my sister.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.326
Not really. Not anymore.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.663
I mean, you don't know anything about me.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.884
I wanna be your brother again.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.431
I wanna make Ike go away.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.185
Erase him from my mind.
Make him dead to me.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.980
I'm such an idiot.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.821
You're not an idiot.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.784
You're just a schmuck like the rest of us.

27:05.918 --> 27:07.419
Come on.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.171
Let's burn some shit.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.716
Bonnie's fucking kitchen.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.847
You know, we should come up with
a banishment for each item.

27:18.931 --> 27:20.140
What do you mean?

27:20.224 --> 27:23.936
Goodbye, awful picture
of Ike and Farrah Fawcett.

27:25.354 --> 27:30.192
Goodbye, party invitation
with a gangsters and molls theme.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.779
Goodbye, ticket to the PEN Gala.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.364
Good! Good!

27:35.447 --> 27:38.450
I bid 20,000 fuck yous
on this auction paddle.

27:38.534 --> 27:40.369
Now you're getting it.

27:42.162 --> 27:45.624
Goodbye,
T-shirt from the fucking bar mitzvah.

27:46.792 --> 27:50.295
Goodbye, checkbook
from the Yaron Foundation.

27:51.004 --> 27:55.175
Goodbye, old, dirty baseball
with some shitty signature on it.

27:55.259 --> 27:56.385
Wait!

27:57.678 --> 27:58.679
Whatever.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.519
So, Phyllis…

28:06.228 --> 28:07.980
Do you think I could see the kids?

28:13.110 --> 28:14.111
I don't know.

28:15.988 --> 28:19.074
But they're not kids anymore,
so it's not up to me.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.158
Right.

28:20.951 --> 28:24.329
I have grandkids now. And dogs.

28:26.206 --> 28:29.168
And I have my own business.
It's doing really well.

28:31.295 --> 28:32.296
And you missed it all.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.547
I know.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.925
I've moved four times.
I've had five different hairstyles.

28:37.009 --> 28:38.969
I've had three serious boyfriends.

28:40.137 --> 28:43.515
Couple of flings
that were mainly about sexual exploration.

28:43.599 --> 28:45.142
Wow. Wow.

28:45.225 --> 28:48.520
Got my kids through college.
Got myself through college.

28:49.521 --> 28:52.524
Made some terrible life choices.
Got myself together.

28:53.192 --> 28:55.068
Learned how to make Indian food.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.321
-Learned to like cilantro.
-No.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.823
You missed it all.

28:59.907 --> 29:02.034
I know. I know. I…

29:03.452 --> 29:05.037
It's like he put a spell on me.

29:05.537 --> 29:10.167
You know?
Like I was hypnotized or brainwashed.

29:10.250 --> 29:14.254
I keep thinking, "How could he do that?
How could he do that to me?"

29:14.338 --> 29:16.215
He was supposed to help me.

29:16.298 --> 29:20.135
My question is,
how could you do that to us?

29:20.219 --> 29:22.346
I never meant to hurt you, I swear.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.723
Well, whether you meant to or not,
you did.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.978
-I know. I know.
-I wanna forgive you, but I can't.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.565
-Not yet.
-I understand.

29:33.649 --> 29:35.526
I'm just so angry.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.654
-Aren't you angry?
-With Ike? Sure.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.197
No, with yourself.

29:41.907 --> 29:43.659
For allowing this to happen.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.088
Here. All right? These will burn well.

29:56.171 --> 29:59.007
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
That's the only copy.

29:59.091 --> 30:00.384
There aren't any duplicates.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.262
It's by Ike,
but great art belongs to the people.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.305
Some Like It Tropical?

30:05.389 --> 30:07.266
-It's a working title.
-Fuck off.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.017
No. No. No, no, no.

30:09.101 --> 30:13.814
Look, I spent years
typing these things over and over.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.067
I would hate to see them go up in smoke.

30:23.323 --> 30:25.200
Wait. Look at this one.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.327
The Brooke Shields.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.913
She couldn't get enough of him. Seriously.

30:29.997 --> 30:32.499
Marty. What the fuck?

30:34.418 --> 30:35.460
Uh-oh.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.964
Hey. Why didn't my key work?

30:40.924 --> 30:43.343
Is that Phyllis?

30:44.595 --> 30:45.762
Long time.

30:45.846 --> 30:49.141
Family reunion? Got it.

30:52.853 --> 30:55.397
I would've brought my marshmallows
if I'd known.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.610
What are you guys burning?

30:59.693 --> 31:02.779
Phyllis was just helping me,
you know, clear some stuff out.

31:02.863 --> 31:03.989
Okay, come on.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.742
Let's go inside. We'll talk things over.

31:06.825 --> 31:10.871
I-- I don't wanna talk to you.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.998
Okay, sure. Fine.

31:15.834 --> 31:19.254
We'll talk later. I'm just gonna go inside
and grab my stuff.

31:21.715 --> 31:24.510
-He's just gonna walk into the house?
-It's okay. It's okay.

31:24.593 --> 31:27.012
-Should I call the cops?
-No. You don't have to call the cops.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.181
How crazy is he, one to ten?
Should I get a knife?

31:29.264 --> 31:31.350
-A what?
-A knife, Marty. Think fast!

31:31.433 --> 31:33.727
This isn't West Side Story.
You don't need a knife.

31:33.810 --> 31:37.147
-I don't know what we're dealing with--
-Where the fuck are my manuscripts?

31:37.773 --> 31:39.024
Where are my books?

31:39.107 --> 31:41.318
Those are my property.
Those are rightfully mine.

31:41.401 --> 31:42.861
That's debatable. I typed them up.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.072
What did you do?
What did you do with them?

31:45.864 --> 31:47.824
Where are they?
Where are the rest? Where are they?

31:47.908 --> 31:49.576
What? No! No!

31:51.119 --> 31:52.287
That's my work.

31:52.955 --> 31:55.415
What are you, crazy?
Are you a fucking lunatic?

31:55.499 --> 31:56.959
I'm sorry.

31:58.252 --> 31:59.253
Sorry.

32:04.258 --> 32:06.593
Marty. Marty, look at me.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.387
Do you remember
what we said all those years ago?

32:09.429 --> 32:10.806
This relationship is toxic.

32:10.889 --> 32:14.309
It's an addiction, and I hate to tell you,
but right now, you're having a relapse.

32:14.393 --> 32:16.854
You're not thinking clearly.
She's got some kind of control over you.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.939
-Oh, my gosh.
-No, she is dangerous.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.775
She's never been on your side.
She's never been on team Marty.

32:21.859 --> 32:23.360
Don't listen to him, Marty. Please.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.572
-Marty. Look at me. Marty, look at me!
-Don't listen to that bullshit!

32:26.655 --> 32:29.283
Let's go inside.
We'll work this out. We're brothers.

32:29.366 --> 32:31.326
He is not your fucking brother!

32:31.410 --> 32:34.121
Phyllis, let me handle this. Thanks.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.665
Go to the car. I'll be there.

32:37.958 --> 32:39.751
-It's all right.
-Some Like It Tropical.

32:40.711 --> 32:43.297
It's a stupid name for a book!

32:48.927 --> 32:51.138
I would like for you to go, please.

32:53.307 --> 32:54.474
Thank you.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.102
What did I ever do to you, Marty?

32:59.646 --> 33:02.524
Twenty-seven years I've been by your side.

33:05.277 --> 33:06.570
Why are you acting like this?

33:06.653 --> 33:07.654
I said go.

33:11.992 --> 33:13.327
All right, fine. I'll go.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.414
If you want me to go so bad.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.167
I'm gonna take the stuff that's mine.

33:21.251 --> 33:23.003
This is mine, and this is mine.

33:24.421 --> 33:27.090
This is mine. This is mine!

33:28.967 --> 33:30.010
It's all mine!

33:30.969 --> 33:32.012
It's mine!

33:34.181 --> 33:35.724
And you know what I'm gonna take--

33:38.393 --> 33:41.647
I'm gonna take my koi too while I'm at it!

33:41.730 --> 33:43.315
No, those koi are mine!

33:51.448 --> 33:54.076
Get off me! You lummox!

33:55.786 --> 33:57.496
Stay away from my koi!

34:04.837 --> 34:06.338
None of this is yours!

34:07.881 --> 34:08.882
None of it is real!

34:08.966 --> 34:11.092
-That's not true.
-It is true!

34:12.135 --> 34:16.306
The only thing real in the last 27 years
was how I felt about you.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.893
I lost my family! My house, my business!

34:20.978 --> 34:22.980
I sacrificed everything I had!

34:23.813 --> 34:26.149
And you used me! You betrayed me!

34:27.067 --> 34:28.527
You took everything from me!

34:29.610 --> 34:30.612
It's over.

34:31.780 --> 34:34.032
It's really over. I'm done.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.956
You were nothing without me.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.878
You are nothing without me.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.190
This feels pretty good!

35:08.275 --> 35:09.776
What the fuck are you doing?

35:12.070 --> 35:14.323
That's for the last 27 years.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.118
Not my car.

35:23.332 --> 35:24.374
Well.

35:53.153 --> 35:57.241
Hey, guys, it's Uncle Marty.

35:57.324 --> 36:00.452
How's tricks? Have you been busy?

36:01.495 --> 36:02.621
Let me see.

36:03.622 --> 36:06.291
You have been busy. Wow.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.710
Hi, everyone.

36:08.794 --> 36:11.547
Hi, Carol. Hi, Sandra.

36:11.630 --> 36:14.424
Hi, Autumn. Mary Lou, look at you.

36:15.342 --> 36:16.426
Hi, Susan.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.306
Well, look at the Bee Gees.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.031
-Louder.
-They're fine.

36:38.115 --> 36:39.491
Nancy, stop micromanaging.

36:42.202 --> 36:44.329
Joel. Joel.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.999
-Joel.
-What?

36:47.082 --> 36:48.709
Take a picture of them.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.878
-I'll do it afterwards.
-Please.

36:50.961 --> 36:53.088
Just take a picture. Don't be an asshole.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.674
Okay. Don't swear in front of my children.

36:55.757 --> 36:56.758
Take the picture.

37:01.430 --> 37:03.515
-Come over here.
-I'm making my way around.

37:03.599 --> 37:05.851
I didn't ask you to make your way around.

37:09.146 --> 37:12.608
Joel, Nancy's so beautiful. If you just--

37:14.359 --> 37:16.695
There it is. That was so wonderful.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.322
That was so wonderful.

37:19.281 --> 37:20.282
Just proud of you.

37:20.365 --> 37:21.617
Thank you, Nana.

37:21.700 --> 37:25.120
Marty. Uncle Marty-- Or-- Marty.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.955
Sorry. Still getting used to it.

37:27.456 --> 37:30.250
You mind opening the door for Elijah
and letting a little air in?

37:31.001 --> 37:32.628
-Sure.
-Can I come?

37:32.711 --> 37:33.754
Of course.

37:37.925 --> 37:40.093
-Your hands are clammy.
-I know.

37:40.177 --> 37:42.304
Joel, get a picture of this.
Get your camera right now.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.348
Oh, my God, again with the pictures?

37:44.431 --> 37:46.517
-You better hurry up.
-Okay.

37:47.601 --> 37:49.269
Elijah isn't here.

37:49.937 --> 37:51.188
He's not?

37:51.271 --> 37:52.272
Nope.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.233
-Did you get it?
-I got it.

37:54.316 --> 37:56.318
Nana, can we sing "Eliyahu Hanavi"?

37:56.401 --> 37:58.320
No, no, no. That's for after dinner.

37:58.403 --> 38:02.241
If she wants to sing it,
we can sing it, all right?

38:02.324 --> 38:03.492
It's a beautiful song.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.344
You okay?

39:05.762 --> 39:06.805
Yeah.

39:08.348 --> 39:09.349
I'm good.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.435
Nana.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.978
Is Marty really your brother?

39:14.062 --> 39:16.231
-He is.
-I didn't know you had a brother.

39:16.899 --> 39:19.318
-I want a brother.
-Yeah, and I want a yacht.

39:22.571 --> 39:23.572
Well, I got one.

39:25.282 --> 39:28.368
And this bag of bones is him.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.132
Matzo ball soup time?

39:42.216 --> 39:45.594
-Yes, please. Starving.
-Matzo ball soup. Yes.

39:49.723 --> 39:51.850
-Eat the Matzo ball.
-Thank you.

39:51.934 --> 39:52.935
Okay.

39:53.018 --> 39:54.228
Could we pass the Haggadahs?

39:54.311 --> 39:56.230
I'd like to use them again
next year, please.

39:56.313 --> 39:58.190
Pass 'em down.
Pass 'em down. Pass 'em down.

39:58.273 --> 39:59.775
Pass it to me, hon.

39:59.858 --> 40:03.904
When Marty Markowitz first came
to see me, he was a broken man.

40:03.987 --> 40:05.280
Hot balls, coming in.

40:05.364 --> 40:10.577
He came to me seeking my help,
and I rebuilt him piece by piece.

40:11.370 --> 40:12.371
It wasn't easy.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.083
Took everything I had to give.

40:18.001 --> 40:21.213
But now he's a great man.

40:22.506 --> 40:23.966
He's a confident man.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.552
He's a successful man.

40:28.011 --> 40:30.764
And that is because of me.

40:32.808 --> 40:34.601
Each patient is unique,

40:34.685 --> 40:39.773
and each requires
a different therapeutic approach, right?

40:39.857 --> 40:44.278
My work with Marty was unique.
There is no doubt.

40:46.405 --> 40:50.367
Yes, he was more than a patient
and a colleague. He--

40:54.246 --> 40:55.289
He became family.

40:56.331 --> 40:58.709
But is that a bad thing?

40:58.792 --> 40:59.835
Tell me, I'm--

41:01.920 --> 41:05.257
Is it wrong to care
in a caring profession?

41:05.340 --> 41:10.137
Am I to be damned for giving my life
to someone, for giving too much?

41:11.763 --> 41:15.392
-Thank you, Dr. Herschkopf--
-Please. I'm-- Let me finish, please.

41:23.734 --> 41:26.695
Marty was more than just a patient.
He was part of my life.

41:32.659 --> 41:34.161
He was the brother that I lost.

41:36.288 --> 41:38.707
He was the best friend
a man could have had.

41:40.334 --> 41:41.710
I gave everything to him.

41:43.504 --> 41:47.049
The allegations that he has made
against me are false and cruel.

41:47.132 --> 41:50.135
How dare he try to have
my license revoked?

41:50.219 --> 41:51.220
I helped him.

41:51.303 --> 41:52.513
I helped you!

41:53.222 --> 41:56.016
I helped him, and now he's trying
to stop me from helping others?

41:56.099 --> 41:58.352
That is unethical behavior,
not what I did.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.441
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:09.696 --> 42:14.368
I don't know everything,
but I know that I'm a good man.

42:16.245 --> 42:18.038
Thank you, Dr. Herschkopf.

42:43.230 --> 42:44.356
Hey.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.526
Hello.

42:47.609 --> 42:48.861
Why are you doing this?

42:50.153 --> 42:51.280
What happened to us?

42:56.410 --> 42:58.537
Hey, guess who I saw on the subway here.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.123
-I have no idea.
-I know you have no idea.

43:01.206 --> 43:03.250
-That's why I said guess.
-No.

43:03.333 --> 43:06.545
-Come on, Marty. Take one guess.
-Ike, let's not do this.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.549
All right, fine. Don't guess.

43:11.425 --> 43:12.426
Diane Sawyer.

43:12.509 --> 43:13.510
Uh-huh.

43:14.428 --> 43:15.429
She looks terrific.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.143
Did you get those bees?

43:21.226 --> 43:23.770
-Yeah, I got the bees.
-You did?

43:25.105 --> 43:27.232
-They make honey?
-Yes, they make honey.

43:27.316 --> 43:29.526
Quite a bit actually.
All the honey I need.

43:30.485 --> 43:31.486
Within reason.

43:33.947 --> 43:35.616
We had some good times, didn't we?

43:36.366 --> 43:37.201
Uh-huh.

43:37.284 --> 43:39.286
In fact, we had some great times.

43:39.369 --> 43:40.370
Not all great.

43:46.376 --> 43:49.338
Hey, is there anything
you want to say to me?

43:50.964 --> 43:53.467
Just me. Not in front of the lawyers.

43:54.051 --> 43:55.594
Just us. Right here. Right now.

43:55.677 --> 43:58.847
Anything you wanna say
about those 27 years?

44:07.105 --> 44:08.398
Yes, there is.

44:12.945 --> 44:14.238
I want to say…

44:16.657 --> 44:17.741
I forgive you.

44:18.575 --> 44:21.328
I forgive you. Of course I do.

44:21.411 --> 44:22.496
How could I not?

44:24.331 --> 44:25.749
I know you're in pain.

44:26.667 --> 44:27.835
I know you're lonely.

44:27.918 --> 44:30.420
It's not too late, Marty. I can help you.

44:31.046 --> 44:32.297
I wanna help you.

44:33.465 --> 44:34.550
Let me help you.

44:39.972 --> 44:40.973
Nothing.

44:42.599 --> 44:44.101
My goodness, nothing.

44:44.852 --> 44:45.853
What?

44:47.271 --> 44:48.730
I feel nothing at all.

44:49.857 --> 44:50.858
I don't understand.

44:50.941 --> 44:53.318
I hope you find happiness, Dr. Ike.

44:54.486 --> 44:57.948
I don't think you will,
but I hope that you do.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.827
But I'm afraid to say…

45:04.705 --> 45:05.956
we're out of time.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.501
Goodbye.
